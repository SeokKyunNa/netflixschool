00:06:16.041,00:06:19.750,"If you're gonna go to the ball, you have to know how to dance like a princess, right?"
00:06:27.000,00:06:30.916,"-One, two, three… You're gonna wear… -I'm gonna wear… -I'm gonna wear… -a bucket on your head?"

00:07:02.583,00:07:03.750,Did you get something to eat?
00:07:04.875,00:07:06.416,"No, I'm not hungry."
00:07:37.000,00:07:38.000,Fuck!

00:09:46.875,00:09:50.291,"Hey, it's me. I just wanted to leave a message."
00:09:51.750,00:09:54.166,Do you think we could make some time to talk later?
00:09:54.250,00:09:55.875,"Just the two of us, without the kids?"
00:09:56.666,00:09:59.083,I really wanna work this thing out.
00:10:00.166,00:10:02.083,Okay? I miss you.
00:10:36.083,00:10:37.708,Eva Khatchadourian?
00:10:56.208,00:10:57.375,Done a lot.
00:11:01.208,00:11:04.958,"Look, Eva. I don't really care who you are, or what you done."
00:11:05.041,00:11:08.041,"So long as you can type and you can file, you can have this job."
00:11:09.625,00:11:12.958,Oh… that… that's wonderful. Thank you.
00:11:16.291,00:11:18.625,I won't let you down. I promise. Thank you.
00:11:19.458,00:11:21.583,-Thank you so much. -Sure.
00:11:22.875,00:11:23.875,See you Monday.
00:11:25.458,00:11:26.583,"Great, thank you."
00:11:48.833,00:11:50.708,Looks like someone's having a nice day.
00:11:51.375,00:11:52.625,Enjoying yourself?
00:11:53.333,00:11:54.291,I'm sorry?
00:11:59.041,00:12:02.416,"I hope you rot in hell, you fucking bitch!"
00:12:10.000,00:12:11.666,Jesus. What the hell was that?
00:12:11.750,00:12:12.958,"-No, that's nothing. -Are you okay?"
00:12:13.041,00:12:13.875,-Really. -Let me call 911.
00:12:13.958,00:12:15.541,"No, it was my fault."
00:12:15.625,00:12:17.333,"-But she just totally hit you. -No, I'm fine."
00:13:33.875,00:13:35.333,"Eva, when are you coming home?"
00:13:40.375,00:13:41.625,I miss you.
00:13:46.500,00:13:47.416,I love you.
00:14:38.833,00:14:40.875,Promise me you'll never go away again.
00:14:41.916,00:14:46.625,I will never… will never… never go away.
00:14:47.666,00:14:49.916,"-Can you promise me? -Yes, I promise. I will never go."
00:14:50.000,00:14:51.750,"Promise me, you'll never go away again."
00:15:02.541,00:15:05.541,"-Is it safe? -No, it's not safe."
00:15:06.541,00:15:07.458,"Try, Eva."
00:15:11.458,00:15:12.708,Are you sure about this?
00:15:49.750,00:15:51.000,Is this really happening?
00:15:58.375,00:16:00.208,I can feel him. I can feel it.
00:16:20.750,00:16:21.625,We did it.
00:16:30.041,00:16:32.208,"I'm gonna need these all processed today, Eva."
00:16:33.041,00:16:36.875,"But today is my afternoon off. You remember, I told you?"
00:16:36.958,00:16:38.291,"Oh, shit, that's right."
00:16:38.375,00:16:41.708,"Well, look at… just… get to them as soon as you can, -will you? -Sure."
00:17:19.250,00:17:21.083,"Someone, help! Please!"
00:18:48.208,00:18:49.458,"-Hey, Eva. -Hey, Al."
00:20:29.000,00:20:30.250,"No, officer, get off me."
00:20:30.333,00:20:33.333,"Let go of me, man. Get off me!"
00:20:33.416,00:20:35.625,"-Keep walking. -Hey, lady!"
00:20:35.708,00:20:38.125,"Lady, please help me! I didn't do nothing, man!"
00:20:38.208,00:20:39.250,I didn't do nothing!
00:20:39.333,00:20:40.541,"Help me, please!"
00:20:40.625,00:20:43.791,Help me! Get the hell off of me! Get off of me!
00:20:50.125,00:20:50.958,Eva?
00:20:51.708,00:20:53.166,"Eva, stop resisting."
00:20:55.041,00:20:57.041,"Stop resisting, Eva."
00:21:00.208,00:21:01.375,Eva.
00:21:43.416,00:21:52.000,Hey… Hey… Hey.
00:22:59.208,00:23:00.541,Rise and shine.
00:23:02.500,00:23:03.708,"It's late, Eva."
00:23:04.708,00:23:06.416,The day's almost over.
00:23:07.041,00:23:09.625,-Hi. -Don't pick him up.
00:23:09.708,00:23:12.333,"Please don't pick him up. I've just put him down, Franklin."
00:23:14.375,00:23:16.625,Hi.
00:23:17.791,00:23:19.583,There he is.
00:23:19.666,00:23:20.958,You wanna play?
00:23:22.250,00:23:23.291,You wanna play?
00:23:27.208,00:23:28.083,He's all right.
00:23:30.666,00:23:32.791,You've got to rock him a little bit. He's all right.
00:23:34.583,00:23:36.333,You think I'm exaggerating?
00:23:39.000,00:23:41.625,You just have to rock him a little bit.
00:23:41.708,00:23:43.958,You just have to rock him a little bit.
00:23:45.333,00:23:47.041,"There's my little, dude."
00:25:30.000,00:25:32.250,"Jesus, it's all 12?"
00:25:36.041,00:25:37.625,-I'll take them as they are. -But they're totally broken.
00:25:37.708,00:25:39.041,I'll take them as they are.
00:25:57.083,00:26:00.625,"Oh, my god! No!"
00:26:10.875,00:26:12.708,"You're a good looking, boy."
00:26:14.041,00:26:16.000,"Man, the girls are gonna love you."
00:26:31.875,00:26:32.875,No.
00:26:33.708,00:26:35.291,Don't wake up.
00:26:39.375,00:26:41.000,Can you say mommy?
00:26:41.083,00:26:44.166,Mommy. Mommy?
00:26:44.250,00:26:45.375,Kevin?
00:26:47.250,00:26:51.291,"Can you say ball? Ball? Bah, bah, bah, bah… Ball."
00:26:52.583,00:26:53.750,No? Okay.
00:26:54.833,00:26:58.875,"I'm gonna throw it to you. You're gonna roll it back to me, Okay."
00:26:59.625,00:27:00.916,Roll it back to Mommy.
00:27:03.083,00:27:04.041,Yeah.
00:27:04.791,00:27:06.916,Roll it back. Roll… roll it back to me.
00:27:15.500,00:27:16.875,Okay.
00:27:19.208,00:27:22.041,"Roll it back, okay? Just roll it back."
00:27:22.708,00:27:30.208,Just roll it back. Just… When he was a baby he never stopped screaming and I thought maybe it had damaged his hearing.
00:27:34.291,00:27:35.708,"No, his hearing's fine."
00:27:39.791,00:27:41.625,But shouldn't he be talking by now?
00:27:42.583,00:27:48.041,I read somewhere that non-verbalizing was an early sign of autism.
00:27:50.791,00:27:53.416,He has none of the telltale rocking signs.
00:27:56.291,00:27:57.791,I wouldn't worry about it too much.
00:28:05.125,00:28:06.750,"He's a floppy little boy, isn't he?"
00:28:09.041,00:28:10.958,But there's nothing wrong with him.
00:28:17.541,00:28:18.750,Thank you.
00:28:25.625,00:28:28.208,Okay. Roll it back to Mommy.
00:28:35.916,00:28:37.250,Okay.
00:28:37.333,00:28:39.833,"Gonna roll it back again. That was really good, Kev."
00:28:40.458,00:28:43.458,"Okay, here we go. Okay?"
00:28:44.625,00:29:04.791,"Okay E is for elephant, large as a house, as big as can be not small like a mouse."
00:29:04.875,00:29:07.458,"Can you say elephant, Kevin?"
00:29:07.541,00:29:10.541,Elephant? Elephant.
00:29:12.833,00:29:15.791,Kevin.
00:29:15.875,00:29:17.708,Could you say mommy for me?
00:29:18.458,00:29:19.375,No.
00:29:19.458,00:29:21.791,-Mommy? -No!
00:29:21.875,00:29:23.791,-Just say Mommy. -No.
00:32:20.166,00:32:21.500,Trick or treat!
00:32:23.958,00:32:26.833,"Trick or treat! Hey, lady we know you're in there."
00:32:30.208,00:32:32.208,-We want candy. -Shit!
00:32:32.291,00:32:34.791,"Hey, lady, we want candy!"
00:32:41.333,00:32:43.875,I don't like that.
00:32:43.958,00:32:46.000,I don't like that.
00:32:47.291,00:32:50.500,Mommy was happy before widdle Kevin came along.
00:32:50.583,00:32:51.416,You know that?
00:32:54.125,00:33:00.125,Now Mommy wakes up every morning and wishes she was in France!
00:33:02.833,00:33:04.208,Trick or treat!
00:33:04.291,00:33:15.166,Candy… Candy… That elevator's a death trap.
00:33:15.666,00:33:19.208,"He needs a yard, somewhere he can toss a ball, fill a pool."
00:33:21.791,00:33:23.208,But I love New York.
00:33:24.500,00:33:27.833,"Come on, you sound like a bumper sticker."
00:33:28.750,00:33:32.416,"It's a matter of priorities, Eva. He's only gonna be a kid once."
00:33:33.500,00:33:35.125,You can house hunt all you want.
00:33:35.208,00:33:37.125,"I'm telling you, I am not leaving the city."
00:33:38.666,00:33:41.708,"Now, Kevin, stop that. That's enough. Let Mom and Daddy talk."
00:33:42.375,00:33:43.833,"Kevin, quit that!"
00:33:48.791,00:33:50.291,You got a family room here.
00:33:51.000,00:33:54.541,Master bedroom's back there with two huge walk-in closets.
00:33:55.666,00:33:57.333,Bathroom is amazing.
00:34:16.833,00:34:19.666,"Here we are, guys. Our very own castle."
00:34:57.541,00:35:01.541,"Hey, I'm gonna go and grab some lunch. Does anybody want anything?"
00:35:15.250,00:35:16.208,Hey.
00:35:17.208,00:35:19.583,"Hey, wait up. Mrs. K."
00:35:24.375,00:35:28.375,Hey. It's me. Soweto.
00:35:33.041,00:35:34.166,Hi there.
00:35:36.916,00:35:38.250,I just wanted to see how you were.
00:35:41.541,00:35:43.416,"I'm fine, thanks."
00:35:45.458,00:35:47.791,-You look well. -Yeah.
00:35:48.375,00:35:50.625,The doctors are saying there's a chance I might walk again.
00:35:52.041,00:35:52.875,That's great.
00:35:56.666,00:35:58.250,"Well, you take care, Mrs. K."
00:35:59.875,00:36:00.833,"You, too."
00:36:37.750,00:36:39.583,"Ah, come on."
00:36:40.166,00:36:42.500,Die!
00:36:43.416,00:36:44.875,No!
00:36:46.250,00:36:47.333,-No. -Got him!
00:36:47.416,00:36:48.708,What? Why? How do you jump?
00:36:50.583,00:36:51.583,Die!
00:36:56.875,00:36:58.416,Go!
00:36:59.500,00:37:00.375,Die!
00:37:12.083,00:37:15.208,"Hey, Kev, you up there? Kevin?"
00:37:16.708,00:37:17.541,"Kev, you hear that?"
00:37:17.625,00:37:21.000,That's Daddy go pee-pee in the pooper-dooper.
00:37:21.083,00:37:23.000,You can do that too.
00:37:46.708,00:37:49.708,"See, you wanna kind of, go right there."
00:37:49.791,00:37:53.416,Now you wanna click on that link and it should open right up.
00:37:53.500,00:37:57.208,"And if it doesn't… Well, we try it again."
00:37:57.958,00:37:59.625,So you left click. You wanna give it a try?
00:37:59.708,00:38:00.750,Sure.
00:38:02.041,00:38:05.458,"No, you wanna right-click, right there."
00:38:05.541,00:38:08.541,"-Yeah. Okay. -See, it opens up."
00:38:09.208,00:38:10.541,Great.
00:38:10.625,00:38:12.541,"Yeah, thanks. I think I got it."
00:38:13.541,00:38:14.750,Thanks for your help.
00:38:32.333,00:38:33.750,I pooped.
00:38:34.833,00:38:36.041,"Hey, buddy. What?"
00:38:38.125,00:38:39.125,You pooped?
00:38:40.125,00:38:43.875,"Oh, okay. Well, let me help you, here. Wait a minute, okay."
00:38:44.541,00:38:47.458,"Here… go to your room, I'll be right there."
00:38:48.916,00:38:50.291,Let's not wake up Mommy.
00:38:50.833,00:38:52.250,"Come on, buddy."
00:39:28.875,00:39:32.166,"These squiggly squares of paper, they're dumb."
00:39:36.708,00:39:38.958,Everybody needs a room of their own.
00:39:39.041,00:39:40.958,You have your room. This is Momma's room.
00:39:41.750,00:39:44.583,"I can help you make your room special, if you like?"
00:39:44.666,00:39:46.291,What do you mean special?
00:39:48.416,00:39:50.958,"Well, so it looks like your personality."
00:39:52.875,00:39:54.875,What personality?
00:39:57.166,00:39:58.791,I think you know what I mean.
00:40:01.541,00:40:03.083,They're dumb.
00:40:15.375,00:40:17.416,"Hey, John. Thanks for returning my call."
00:40:17.500,00:40:20.333,Hi. I'm was just wondering how the Japanese edition guide?
00:40:20.416,00:40:21.625,"Oh, she has? Really?"
00:40:22.166,00:40:23.291,Bored out of my mind.
00:40:24.458,00:40:26.208,I wondered if you wanted me to come in.
00:40:27.541,00:40:29.208,"No. I mean, it's good."
00:40:30.500,00:40:32.041,You don't need me to do that?
00:40:33.291,00:40:35.041,And the guide?
00:40:36.583,00:40:37.583,Okay.
00:40:40.583,00:40:45.375,"Well, I mean, if you have it in hand… I could? Really?"
00:40:48.916,00:40:52.458,"Well, that all sounds great. Okay, John."
00:40:53.125,00:40:56.250,"Okay? I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye."
00:41:05.833,00:41:07.041,Kevin?
00:41:09.625,00:41:10.750,Kevin?
00:42:18.250,00:42:24.375,He says he's really sorry… and that he was only trying to help make it special.
00:42:48.958,00:42:50.500,Do you remember how you got that?
00:42:53.375,00:42:55.291,The most honest thing you ever did.
00:42:58.500,00:43:00.541,You know how they potty train cats?
00:43:02.083,00:43:04.041,They stick their noses in their own shit.
00:43:06.958,00:43:10.208,"They don't like it, so they use the box."
00:43:13.708,00:43:15.458,Okay. Let's work on our counting.
00:43:16.166,00:43:18.625,-What comes after three? -Nine.
00:43:21.083,00:43:23.916,-What comes after seven? -Seventy-one.
00:43:25.000,00:43:46.541,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50."
00:43:47.083,00:43:48.333,Now can we quit?
00:43:59.375,00:44:03.583,"There, you can add that together, since you think you're so smart."
00:44:18.833,00:44:20.583,You did not!
00:44:22.833,00:44:24.166,You did not.
00:44:45.583,00:44:46.875,Are you enjoying yourself?
00:45:19.875,00:45:22.083,I can see the doctor by myself.
00:45:38.625,00:45:40.375,"I have to tell you something, Eva."
00:45:42.083,00:45:43.916,That's a brave boy you've got there.
00:45:51.041,00:45:52.791,-Thank you. -Anytime.
00:46:15.208,00:46:23.833,"What Mommer did was very, very wrong and she's so, so sorry."
00:46:37.375,00:46:39.583,"Hey, Kev? Kev, hold on a sec."
00:46:40.958,00:46:41.833,Kev.
00:46:43.375,00:46:44.375,Kevin.
00:46:46.541,00:46:48.875,"Hey, Kev. What happened?"
00:46:49.833,00:46:51.166,I broke my arm.
00:46:51.708,00:46:53.083,How did you break your arm?
00:46:53.166,00:46:56.916,I had poopy pants. Mommer went to get wipes.
00:46:57.583,00:47:00.416,I fell off the changing table onto my dump truck.
00:47:01.208,00:47:03.333,Mom took me to Dr. Goldbutt.
00:47:10.291,00:47:11.708,It was all my fault.
00:47:14.208,00:47:16.083,"No, don't be silly."
00:47:16.583,00:47:19.041,You can't watch him every second of the day.
00:47:48.291,00:47:49.416,Franklin.
00:48:05.333,00:48:06.666,Unbelievable.
00:48:08.541,00:48:09.958,How did you get him to do that?
00:48:14.708,00:48:16.541,"Well, whatever it was, it worked."
00:48:32.041,00:48:33.458,Not yet.
00:48:45.208,00:48:46.250,Okay.
00:49:05.541,00:49:06.875,"I love you, kiddo."
00:50:15.083,00:50:17.375,I don't like that. Turn it off.
00:50:29.708,00:50:32.041,"Honey, do you mind if I stop off at the store?"
00:50:32.541,00:50:34.208,I wanna go home.
00:50:36.083,00:50:48.041,It's just that I need to pick up… Home it is.
00:51:07.208,00:51:08.458,"Hey, guys."
00:51:09.125,00:51:12.375,"Hey, Dad, how was work? Take any cool pictures?"
00:51:23.541,00:51:25.708,"Eva, he's just a boy."
00:51:27.375,00:51:31.541,He's a sweet little boy. That's what boys do.
00:52:25.791,00:52:27.291,Mommer's fat.
00:52:32.333,00:52:35.083,When did you… when were you going to tell me?
00:52:35.166,00:52:36.875,Soon. Now.
00:52:39.166,00:52:41.375,How am I a part of the decision now?
00:52:42.166,00:52:43.791,What am I supposed to say now?
00:52:45.250,00:52:58.083,"What… So, the daddy bear plants his seed in the mommy bear and it grows into an egg."
00:52:58.875,00:53:00.333,Is this about fucking?
00:53:03.875,00:53:05.541,Do you know what that means?
00:53:07.250,00:53:09.625,The boy puts his pee-pee in the girl's doo-doo.
00:53:13.375,00:53:18.375,"Well, haven't you ever wished you had somebody else around to play with?"
00:53:18.458,00:53:19.291,No.
00:53:20.166,00:53:22.833,-You might like it. -What if I don't like it?
00:53:23.375,00:53:25.041,Then you get used to it.
00:53:25.791,00:53:28.958,Just because you're used to something doesn't mean you like it.
00:53:29.041,00:53:30.375,You're used to me.
00:53:34.708,00:53:40.000,"Yes, well, in a few months we're all gonna get used to somebody new."
00:53:45.416,00:53:46.916,Beautiful.
00:53:47.875,00:53:51.208,"Hey, Kev. Come on over here and meet your little sister."
00:53:51.291,00:53:52.708,He's your big brother.
00:53:53.375,00:53:54.708,That's Kevin.
00:53:55.791,00:53:57.333,That's your big brother.
00:53:57.875,00:54:00.333,Yes. Yeah.
00:54:01.375,00:54:05.166,It's Kevin. It is.
00:54:05.250,00:54:08.541,"-Kevin, don't. Don't do that. -Kev."
00:54:08.625,00:54:11.041,No. That's not nice.
00:54:11.541,00:54:14.541,"-It's okay. -We'd better go downstairs and see if they have any snacks, okay?"
00:54:14.625,00:54:16.000,-Come on. -Okay.
00:54:16.083,00:54:17.458,We'll get us some Cheez Doodles.
00:54:29.583,00:54:34.041,"Christ, Ecuador? For two months? Why can't you send someone else?"
00:54:34.791,00:54:37.291,I really wanna work this thing out.
00:54:40.291,00:54:42.750,"First, he cries too much. Then, he's too quiet."
00:54:42.833,00:54:45.750,"Then, he makes up his own little language, and it's annoying."
00:54:45.833,00:54:48.541,"Then he has trouble toilet training, a lot of kids do."
00:54:48.625,00:54:50.166,And you see it as some kind of personal vendetta.
00:54:50.250,00:54:51.375,It's not good for him.
00:54:54.291,00:54:57.375,"Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!"
00:54:58.250,00:54:59.875,Pick up the god damn phone!
00:55:00.958,00:55:20.916,"…5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27… La, la, la We're getting ready for the party La, la, la Please!"
00:55:21.000,00:55:25.791,Please let me have a drink. I'm begging you.
00:55:25.875,00:55:27.583,Please!
00:55:33.708,00:55:35.041,Kevin?
00:55:36.416,00:55:37.458,Kevin?
00:55:39.916,00:55:41.041,Honey!
00:55:44.375,00:55:45.708,Are you okay?
00:56:11.375,00:56:12.791,"I'm sorry, Mom."
00:56:14.458,00:56:18.416,"Not to worry, sweetheart. You couldn't help it."
00:56:21.875,00:56:23.791,'By my soul' cried Gilbert.
00:56:23.875,00:56:29.083,"'Art thou the devil in blue to shoot him that wise?' 'Nay' quote Robin, laughing."
00:56:29.166,00:56:34.583,"'Not quite so ill as that I trust.' And he took up another shaft… Are you okay, hon?"
00:56:41.541,00:56:44.958,And he took up another shaft and fitted it to the string.
00:56:45.041,00:56:49.833,Again he shot and again he smote the arrow close beside the center.
00:56:49.916,00:57:01.875,"The third time he loosed his bowstring and dropped his arrow just betwixt the other two and into the very center, so that the feathers of all three were ruffled together, seeming from a distance to be one thick shaft."
00:57:02.666,00:57:06.416,And now a low murmur ran all among that great crowd.
00:57:06.500,00:57:07.791,"Hey, champ. How you doing?"
00:57:09.583,00:57:10.916,Feeling better?
00:57:12.208,00:57:13.833,"Go away, I'm tired."
00:57:15.541,00:57:17.250,"Oh, okay."
00:57:19.083,00:57:21.458,"Sure thing, buddy. You just get some rest, okay?"
00:57:22.166,00:57:23.791,"Don't stop reading, Mom."
00:57:31.083,00:57:44.208,"Two hundred and eighty score shafts were shot in all, and so deftly were they sped that when the shooting was done each target looked like the back of a hedgehog when the farm dog snuffs at it."
00:58:34.708,00:58:35.583,"Good afternoon, ma'am."
00:58:35.666,00:58:37.958,I hope this isn't an inconvenient time?
00:58:38.041,00:58:39.458,"Well, it is actually."
00:58:39.541,00:58:41.666,"Well, we just had a couple of quick questions for you."
00:58:42.416,00:58:43.708,What's this about?
00:58:44.708,00:58:46.708,Do you know where you're spending the afterlife?
00:58:48.125,00:58:50.958,"Oh, yes, I do, as a matter of fact."
00:58:51.041,00:58:52.708,I'm going straight to hell.
00:58:52.791,00:58:54.875,Eternal damnation. The whole bit.
00:58:54.958,00:58:57.250,Thank you for asking. Okay?
00:59:05.250,00:59:06.791,"Hey, honey. Let me help you with that."
00:59:08.625,00:59:11.083,I can dress myself. Can you leave?
00:59:13.958,00:59:15.208,Sure.
00:59:16.458,00:59:17.750,Glad you're feeling better.
00:59:17.833,00:59:20.291,You want some more of that chowder for lunch?
00:59:20.375,00:59:21.708,Whatever.
00:59:21.791,00:59:25.083,-Or a grilled cheese sandwich? -I don't give a rat's ass.
00:59:35.708,00:59:39.291,"-Thanks, Dad. This is so cool. -You're welcome, buddy."
00:59:39.375,00:59:41.291,All right. Here we go. Right in the middle.
00:59:41.375,00:59:44.791,"Oh, almost! Here. Use that one."
00:59:44.875,00:59:46.458,Let's try again.
00:59:46.541,00:59:48.416,Wrap you fingers.
00:59:49.250,00:59:51.208,Just keep your eye on the middle.
01:00:48.541,01:00:49.750,"Good shot, Kev."
01:00:50.458,01:00:51.458,You're a natural.
01:00:54.625,01:00:55.666,Perfect.
01:00:56.416,01:00:57.375,"Thanks, Dad."
01:01:37.041,01:01:40.583,All right… it's like this.
01:01:43.208,01:01:46.875,You wake up and you watch TV.
01:01:48.583,01:01:51.333,"Get in your car, and you listen to the radio."
01:01:52.458,01:01:59.583,"And you go to your little job, or your little school but you're not going to hear about that on the six o'clock news."
01:02:02.041,01:02:03.291,Why?
01:02:03.958,01:02:06.083,Because nothing is really happening.
01:02:08.291,01:02:10.541,And you go home and you watch some more TV.
01:02:10.625,01:02:15.000,"Or maybe, if it's a fun night, you go out and you watch a movie."
01:02:17.500,01:02:25.125,"I mean it's got so bad that half the time the people on TV, inside the TV, they're watching TV."
01:02:27.791,01:02:29.791,And what are all these people watching?
01:02:30.833,01:02:31.875,Huh?
01:02:35.166,01:02:36.500,People like me.
01:02:40.458,01:02:42.500,"I mean, what are all you doing right now?"
01:02:44.041,01:02:45.583,But watching me?
01:02:49.166,01:02:53.375,"You don't think they would have changed the channel by now, if all I did was get an A in geometry?"
01:03:42.500,01:03:45.208,Me and Kevin were playing Christmas kidnapping.
01:03:46.208,01:03:47.333,Kevin?
01:03:48.583,01:03:51.708,"Kevin, you're my friend! You're my friend."
01:03:51.791,01:03:54.333,"Beat it, Celie. Go get me a soda."
01:04:04.833,01:04:06.916,"No, not that one, you retard."
01:04:07.625,01:04:08.833,-Get me a root beer. -Hey!
01:04:09.833,01:04:10.875,What?
01:04:16.125,01:04:18.083,"Thanks, Celie. I was thirsty."
01:04:22.041,01:04:24.750,"Hey, you wanna know a secret? Come really close."
01:04:25.541,01:04:28.416,You know who else is thirsty? You don't?
01:04:31.458,01:04:33.541,-Mommy! -It's the vacuum monster!
01:04:34.166,01:04:35.500,Cut it out.
01:04:39.708,01:04:41.958,"-Hey, troops! -Daddy!"
01:04:42.500,01:04:46.000,"Ho, ho, ho! Look what I got! Hey, Kev, give me a hand."
01:04:46.083,01:04:47.041,"Yeah. Sure, Dad."
01:05:03.791,01:05:05.875,We're gonna be talking about it next Monday!
01:05:55.458,01:05:57.375,We're gonna be talking about it next Monday!
01:06:09.541,01:06:10.583,Wanna dance?
01:06:12.541,01:06:13.708,"No, thanks, Colin."
01:06:16.041,01:06:17.875,Come on. Just one.
01:06:18.791,01:06:20.125,I don't dance. Really.
01:06:32.041,01:06:34.583,Where do you get off? You stuck up bitch.
01:06:38.166,01:06:40.708,You think anyone else is going to want you now?
01:06:59.791,01:07:01.541,"Come on, Eva, stay for another drink."
01:07:02.791,01:07:05.416,"Eva, come on. Oh, come on."
01:07:09.875,01:07:11.375,"Come on, dance with me."
01:07:25.041,01:07:27.083,-Are you excited? -Yeah.
01:07:27.166,01:07:29.375,Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer?
01:07:29.458,01:07:30.875,-Yes. We'll see. -Yeah.
01:07:48.041,01:07:49.125,Kevin!
01:08:32.416,01:08:35.250,Didn't I see you at the book store today?
01:08:38.416,01:08:39.458,Nope.
01:08:41.125,01:08:51.958,"Funny, I could have sworn… By the way, are you doing anything Friday?"
01:08:55.625,01:08:56.541,Why?
01:09:00.125,01:09:03.916,Just thought we might do something together… for fun.
01:09:05.875,01:09:07.083,Like do what?
01:09:09.041,01:09:10.500,Maybe take you for dinner?
01:09:12.166,01:09:14.500,Play a round of miniature golf.
01:09:30.416,01:09:31.375,Okay.
01:09:45.458,01:09:47.208,Why didn't you bring a coat?
01:09:49.166,01:09:51.208,"You just can't get uncomfortable enough, can you?"
01:09:52.041,01:09:55.083,Uncomfortable? With my own mother?
01:10:06.666,01:10:08.875,Whenever I see fat people they're always eating.
01:10:09.833,01:10:13.416,"Don't give me any of this slow metabolism, it's my glands, crap."
01:10:14.125,01:10:17.125,It's food. They're fat because they eat the wrong food.
01:10:17.208,01:10:18.916,Too much of it and all the time.
01:10:24.083,01:10:26.333,You can be kind of harsh sometimes.
01:10:27.375,01:10:28.708,You're one to talk.
01:10:29.291,01:10:31.333,"Yeah, I am."
01:10:32.708,01:10:33.833,Wonder where I got it?
01:10:52.125,01:10:53.958,"Well, you won."
01:11:15.375,01:11:18.583,"So, what next, Momsy?"
01:11:19.958,01:11:24.375,"We're gonna go home, you're gonna get changed into something reasonable, and I'm taking you to dinner."
01:11:25.666,01:11:26.708,Great.
01:11:40.541,01:11:41.875,We're going to dinner.
01:11:44.833,01:11:46.041,I was hungry.
01:11:47.250,01:11:48.416,"I'm a growing boy, you know."
01:11:58.250,01:12:07.250,"I'll have… calamari salad, steak, medium rare, and a bottle of Merlot."
01:12:07.333,01:12:09.708,All right. Be right back with that.
01:12:24.500,01:12:26.208,"So, how's school going?"
01:12:31.958,01:12:33.208,It's going.
01:12:34.750,01:12:36.000,Do you want my course schedule?
01:12:38.875,01:12:44.291,"How about your teachers? Are there any who are especially… What bands am I listening to these days, right?"
01:12:46.166,01:12:50.958,"Next, you can wheedle about whether there isn't some cute little cunt in the front row, who's got me itchy."
01:12:52.250,01:12:57.541,"That way, you can segue into how it's all up to me, of course, but before balling the chick in the hallway."
01:12:57.625,01:12:59.916,"You know, I might decide to wait until I'm ready."
01:13:01.375,01:13:03.625,Right around dessert you can ask about drugs.
01:13:04.375,01:13:07.708,"Real careful, like, cause you don't want to scare me into like, lying my head off."
01:13:07.791,01:13:10.625,So you have to say how you've experimented.
01:13:13.708,01:13:21.125,"Then finally, once you've sucked up that entire bottle of wine, you can go all gooey eyed and say how nice it is to spend quality time together."
01:13:21.208,01:13:26.125,You can scooch over and put your arm around my shoulder give it a little squeeze.
01:15:20.166,01:15:21.083,Fuck.
01:15:31.916,01:15:34.916,"Your computer's fucked, isn't it?"
01:15:35.000,01:15:38.666,"Yeah, it's fucked, and so are all the ones at work."
01:15:40.125,01:15:41.708,I guess I deserved it.
01:15:46.666,01:15:48.791,Why would you have something like that?
01:15:49.875,01:15:51.000,I collect them.
01:15:54.666,01:15:56.708,Isn't that a weird thing to collect?
01:15:57.250,01:15:59.208,I don't like stamps.
01:16:03.208,01:16:04.208,But what's the point?
01:16:07.666,01:16:09.000,There is no point.
01:16:10.250,01:16:11.375,That's the point.
01:16:16.916,01:16:19.000,"No, it really hasn't been any trouble at all."
01:16:19.083,01:16:20.541,Everybody's bringing a dish.
01:16:30.958,01:16:33.375,"Oh, that's them now. I gotta go."
01:16:34.166,01:16:35.500,"Okay, you have a great day."
01:16:37.875,01:16:39.000,"Bye, Mom."
01:16:41.041,01:16:42.291,Merry Christmas.
01:16:59.375,01:17:00.916,"All right, Kev. You're next."
01:17:02.583,01:17:03.708,Can you guess what it is?
01:17:08.875,01:17:10.375,It's a series seven.
01:17:11.000,01:17:12.833,The guy in the store said it was the best one.
01:17:13.583,01:17:16.791,"Gee, Dad. Thank you so much."
01:17:17.708,01:17:19.250,"-Merry Christmas, Kevin. -It's perfect."
01:17:22.541,01:17:23.583,Sorry.
01:17:26.333,01:17:28.833,What did you eat for breakfast?
01:17:33.625,01:17:35.416,"How was your day, Snuffles?"
01:17:49.458,01:17:51.125,"Oh, yeah!"
01:17:52.250,01:17:55.791,"Did you hear that thunk? That's a powerful thing, man."
01:18:05.541,01:18:06.666,Celie?
01:18:12.125,01:18:14.750,"Come on, honey. Time for bed. There we go."
01:18:24.916,01:18:26.875,I thought I closed the door.
01:18:29.750,01:18:31.958,Kevin says I'm stupid and he's right.
01:18:33.916,01:18:35.375,"You're not stupid, honey."
01:18:37.916,01:18:39.750,"Don't you worry, we'll find him."
01:18:41.041,01:18:44.166,Now you scoot down. Come on. Scoot down.
01:18:46.833,01:18:49.041,Okay. You cozy?
01:19:20.541,01:19:23.500,-Snuffles? -Snuffles?
01:19:24.666,01:19:30.750,"Eva, face it. Mr. Snuffles has gone to the big pet store in the sky."
01:19:30.833,01:19:34.583,"-Don't say that. -Yes, -Don't even… Don't even joke. -but it's true."
01:19:34.666,01:19:35.958,Dearly beloved.
01:19:36.041,01:19:38.541,We are gathered here to mourn Mr. Snuffles.
01:19:38.625,01:19:50.250,"Stop it. Do you have to say those things… Who was snuffed out tragically early… So, Daddy and Mommy were looking for him the whole night."
01:19:50.833,01:19:52.458,But you know why we couldn't find him?
01:19:53.041,01:19:56.083,Because Snuffles has gone to live in the garden.
01:19:57.458,01:20:01.958,"He's living in the garden now, with a whole bunch of new animal friends."
01:20:04.708,01:20:05.916,"-I'll give you a hand. -Oh, really?"
01:20:06.000,01:20:07.125,Celie?
01:20:11.666,01:20:12.833,"Okay, give me the spoon."
01:20:14.875,01:20:24.416,"So, they're having a big party tonight with the chipmunks, and the squirrels, and the racoons."
01:20:25.083,01:21:52.291,And they're eating nuts and berries and they're gonna have a whole bunch… Why… why did you leave the drain stuff out?
01:21:55.166,01:21:57.875,I didn't. I put it away.
01:21:57.958,01:21:59.083,Then how did it get out?
01:22:09.541,01:22:10.708,It was Kevin.
01:22:11.750,01:22:12.583,Kevin did it.
01:22:16.958,01:22:18.875,You need to go talk to someone.
01:23:36.291,01:23:40.416,"So, Kev. Mom had something that she wanted to tell you."
01:23:51.291,01:23:57.333,I wanted to… thank you for calling the ambulance.
01:24:01.375,01:24:12.458,And… And… I was concerned that you might be feeling responsible.
01:24:14.833,01:24:15.875,Why's that?
01:24:17.541,01:24:19.875,Because you were supposed to be looking after her.
01:24:19.958,01:24:22.041,We just don't want you to blame yourself.
01:24:23.166,01:24:24.666,"No, I don't."
01:24:25.333,01:24:26.958,"I mean, I never said I did."
01:24:28.583,01:24:31.208,"She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin."
01:24:31.291,01:24:41.416,"So, we would appreciate you looking out for her and any name calling… You don't really remember being a kid much, do you Dad?"
01:24:43.000,01:24:44.875,Celia's just gonna have to suck it up.
01:24:52.916,01:24:54.333,I thought you didn't like those.
01:24:55.833,01:24:57.750,"Yeah, well they're… they're whadda-ya-call-it?"
01:25:01.708,01:25:03.458,An acquired taste.
01:26:01.250,01:26:03.083,"Sorry, honey. I'm so sorry."
01:26:11.500,01:26:12.333,There you go.
01:26:18.708,01:26:19.625,Okay.
01:26:25.000,01:26:26.333,"Thank you, Mommy."
01:26:38.166,01:26:40.666,"-I think I'm gonna have to hit her. -No, you're not gonna hit my wife."
01:26:40.750,01:26:44.250,"-Hey, kiddo. More practice? -Yeah, you know it."
01:26:44.333,01:26:45.958,"Hey, Celie, you want to come collect the arrows?"
01:26:46.041,01:26:47.500,-No! -I gotta hit somebody!
01:26:48.458,01:26:49.583,You know what patsy is?
01:26:52.791,01:26:55.583,"Look… -Thanks, sweetie. -All right. I know. I'm going."
01:26:56.166,01:26:58.666,I'm going because I'm a sweetheart of a guy.
01:27:09.583,01:27:12.541,"So, what do you wanna do?"
01:27:20.166,01:27:26.541,We'll last out the school year if we can… make arrangements over the summer.
01:27:30.500,01:27:32.625,At least custody is a no brainer.
01:27:35.500,01:27:36.541,Is it?
01:27:40.083,01:27:41.125,You've decided.
01:27:44.000,01:27:45.916,"Eva, there's nothing left to decide."
01:27:48.791,01:27:50.041,It already happened.
01:28:02.208,01:28:03.375,I needed a drink of water.
01:28:04.416,01:28:05.541,"Hey, Kev."
01:28:08.041,01:28:13.041,"Listen buddy, it's easy to misunderstand something when you hear it out of context."
01:28:17.208,01:28:19.041,Why would I not know the context?
01:28:22.000,01:28:23.666,I am the context.
01:28:41.458,01:28:42.708,We have to appeal.
01:28:42.791,01:28:44.541,"-Paying costs, it's punitive. -No."
01:28:44.625,01:28:46.958,"But you'll lose everything, your business, your house."
01:28:47.041,01:28:49.416,I hate the house. I always have.
01:28:49.500,01:28:52.041,"Run, bitch! You'll rot in hell!"
01:29:10.041,01:29:13.583,"-Hey. -Yeah, parcel for Kevin Khatcha… dourian?"
01:29:13.666,01:29:14.708,"Dourian, right."
01:29:21.041,01:29:22.625,"-Careful, it's heavy. -It is?"
01:29:22.708,01:29:23.625,Yeah.
01:29:25.750,01:29:27.083,"-You have a nice day. -You, too."
01:29:56.375,01:29:58.875,What are they for? You never ride your bike.
01:29:59.750,01:30:02.291,I got these for a song off the web.
01:30:02.375,01:30:04.291,I'll make a bundle selling them at school.
01:30:05.916,01:30:07.250,"Next Donald Trump, huh?"
01:30:40.041,01:30:41.083,Come with me.
01:30:42.250,01:30:45.958,Come with me. Yeah… Come with me.
01:30:47.916,01:30:49.541,I'll take you back to my ship.
01:32:01.541,01:32:04.291,"…two, three. One, two, three."
01:32:04.375,01:32:07.750,"One, two, three."
01:32:07.833,01:32:10.708,"One, two, three."
01:32:12.416,01:32:16.750,"One, two, three."
01:32:16.833,01:32:18.916,"One, two, three."
01:32:19.000,01:32:20.166,Ready for the big dip?
01:32:23.958,01:32:27.250,"One, two, three."
01:32:27.333,01:32:32.875,"One, two, three."
01:32:32.958,01:32:35.250,"Enchanted to meet you, young lady."
01:32:41.041,01:32:44.000,"Yes. Yes, I did."
01:32:44.583,01:32:47.458,"-Did you eat all your cereal? -Yes, I did!"
01:32:47.541,01:32:48.458,All right.
01:32:56.625,01:32:59.208,You're a little clammy. You feeling okay?
01:33:00.500,01:33:01.500,Never better.
01:33:04.291,01:33:07.833,"Hey, only three days to go 'til you're 16, huh?"
01:33:08.583,01:33:10.833,We should do something. How about Sunday?
01:33:12.083,01:33:13.166,Dunno.
01:33:14.208,01:33:15.333,Might be tied up.
01:33:17.625,01:33:20.541,"Come on, clean up some of this mess, and then we're gonna get dressed and go."
01:33:20.625,01:33:21.916,-Daddy has… -I don't wanna go to school.
01:33:22.000,01:33:25.083,I know. But Daddy has to take a shower and we have to go.
01:33:25.166,01:33:26.208,Say goodbye.
01:33:35.583,01:33:36.541,Franklin?
01:33:37.791,01:33:42.583,"Do you think we could make some time to talk later, just the two of us without the kids?"
01:33:42.666,01:33:44.708,I really wanna work this thing out.
01:33:46.541,01:33:48.333,Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?
01:34:26.916,01:34:29.583,Franklin. Pick up the god damn phone!
01:34:30.583,01:34:31.541,Franklin.
01:34:59.708,01:35:02.166,I'm a mother. My child… I have my son here.
01:35:04.000,01:35:04.833,Kevin?
01:35:07.875,01:35:08.833,Kevin!
01:35:12.166,01:35:13.458,Have you seen Kevin?
01:35:16.666,01:35:17.583,Kevin?
01:35:19.250,01:35:20.375,Kevin?
01:37:11.791,01:37:14.541,Laura!
01:37:38.333,01:37:39.541,Go.
01:37:40.958,01:37:41.916,Fight.
01:37:43.500,01:37:44.416,Win.
01:37:45.708,01:37:46.833,"Go, fight, win!"
01:37:48.541,01:37:49.958,Go.
01:37:50.833,01:37:51.958,Fight.
01:37:53.291,01:37:54.166,Win.
01:37:55.416,01:37:56.583,"Go, fight, win!"
01:37:58.416,01:37:59.500,Go.
01:38:00.416,01:38:01.250,Fight.
01:38:39.333,01:38:40.541,Franklin?
01:38:49.125,01:38:50.125,Celie?
01:38:57.625,01:38:58.583,Franklin?
01:39:03.291,01:39:04.416,Celie?
01:41:04.041,01:41:05.166,Go.
01:41:06.541,01:41:07.750,Fight.
01:43:54.791,01:43:56.125,You don't look happy.
01:44:02.541,01:44:03.875,Have I ever?
01:44:08.041,01:44:09.666,"I'm almost 18, aren't I?"
01:44:14.416,01:44:15.541,What is it?
01:44:16.208,01:44:18.458,Going to big school making you nervous?
01:44:21.333,01:44:22.541,Nervous?
01:44:25.125,01:44:27.750,Do you know anything about those places?
01:44:35.041,01:44:39.250,"Well, you managed it all so well."
01:44:41.541,01:44:46.208,Tried as a minor… out of your head on Prozac.
01:44:48.708,01:44:50.708,You'll be out of there in a couple of years.
01:44:58.333,01:44:59.958,Know what day it is today?
01:45:00.041,01:45:01.958,Why they let me come and see you on a Monday?
01:45:03.708,01:45:04.666,Sure.
01:45:05.791,01:45:07.208,It's my anniversary.
01:45:09.708,01:45:10.625,Two years.
01:45:13.750,01:45:15.250,Plenty of time to think about it.
01:45:30.041,01:45:34.458,I want you to tell me… why?
01:45:54.958,01:45:56.375,I used to think I knew.
01:46:00.250,01:46:01.791,Now I'm not so sure.
01:46:23.791,01:46:24.708,Time's up.
