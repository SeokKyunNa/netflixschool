00:02:20.766,00:03:59.447,ANNIE: Annie.
00:04:01.033,00:04:02.409,Annie!
00:04:03.577,00:04:05.620,Annie!
00:04:06.705,00:04:08.665,Annie!
00:04:08.665,00:04:10.542,Annie!
00:04:12.419,00:04:13.670,Shh.
00:04:13.670,00:04:15.380,It's okay.
00:04:15.380,00:04:17.925,Everything's gonna be all right.
00:04:17.925,00:04:20.343,"There, there."
00:04:20.343,00:04:22.721,"It was only a dream, Molly."
00:04:22.721,00:04:24.098,It's all right.
00:04:24.098,00:04:26.808,How am I supposed to get any sleep around here?
00:04:26.808,00:04:28.894,It was only a dream.
00:04:28.894,00:04:30.604,Everything's all right.
00:04:30.604,00:04:33.440,Molly shouldn't be in this room.
00:04:33.440,00:04:35.192,She's a baby.
00:04:35.192,00:04:37.694,She cries all the time.
00:04:37.694,00:04:39.613,She wets the bed.
00:04:39.613,00:04:41.448,I do not!
00:04:41.448,00:04:43.700,You're the one who shouldn't be in here!
00:04:43.700,00:04:45.702,Brat!
00:04:45.702,00:04:47.788,We're going to get in trouble.
00:04:47.788,00:04:49.206,"Go, Duffy! Go!"
00:04:49.206,00:04:50.791,"Oh, my goodness!"
00:04:50.791,00:04:52.209,"Oh, my goodness!"
00:04:53.460,00:04:54.711,Cut it out!
00:04:54.711,00:04:57.422,I mean it!
00:04:57.422,00:05:00.008,Do you want Miss Hannigan to come in here?
00:05:00.008,00:05:02.219,Go back to bed.
00:05:04.179,00:05:05.472,Now.
00:05:05.472,00:05:09.059,Or you'll have me to deal with.
00:05:09.059,00:05:12.020,"Aw, blow it out your old wazoo."
00:05:19.820,00:05:21.280,Close your eyes.
00:05:21.280,00:05:23.364,Think about your folks.
00:05:23.364,00:05:25.993,You're the only one who really has folks.
00:05:25.993,00:05:27.828,Mine are dead.
00:05:27.828,00:05:34.375,Think about the folks who want to adopt you because they want a little girl with brown hair and brown eyes.
00:05:56.439,00:05:58.317,"Oh, my goodness."
00:06:33.810,00:06:35.896,Did I hear...
00:06:35.896,00:06:37.438,singing in here?
00:06:45.030,00:06:46.698,All right.
00:06:46.698,00:06:48.407,Fine.
00:06:48.407,00:06:51.328,Since we're all so wide awake...
00:06:51.328,00:06:53.705,Get up!
00:06:55.165,00:06:56.958,Clean up this mess!
00:06:56.958,00:06:58.793,Get dressed!
00:06:58.793,00:07:08.262,"And this room had better be regulation before breakfast, my little pig droppings, or kill, kill, kill!"
00:07:08.262,00:07:09.804,But it's in the middle of the night.
00:07:09.804,00:07:13.725,But it's in the middle of the night.
00:07:13.725,00:07:23.360,"And if this floor don't shine like the top of the Chrysler Building, your backsides will, you understand?"
00:07:23.360,00:07:26.029,"Yes, Miss Hannigan."
00:07:27.530,00:07:29.699,"What do we say, Annie?"
00:07:29.699,00:07:33.203,"I love you, Miss Hannigan."
00:07:33.203,00:07:37.665,Why any kid would want to be an orphan is beyond me.
00:07:37.665,00:07:40.043,Ow!
00:10:04.812,00:10:11.611,You'll stay up till this dump shines like the top of the Chrysler Building.
00:10:14.614,00:10:16.241,"Kill, kill."
00:10:17.867,00:10:19.077,Little pig droppings.
00:10:20.828,00:10:22.038,Rotten orphans.
00:10:23.706,00:10:25.166,Nobody loves you.
00:10:25.166,00:10:27.210,"I love you, Miss Hannigan."
00:10:27.210,00:10:29.921,Get to work!
00:10:29.921,00:10:31.381,Strip that bed!
00:10:32.966,00:10:34.468,Scrub that floor!
00:10:46.854,00:10:48.648,Polish my shoes!
00:10:50.942,00:10:52.986,And I mean...
00:10:52.986,00:10:55.822,start now!
00:11:17.093,00:11:18.845,Get out of here.
00:11:18.845,00:11:21.598,We better get out of here or we're gonna get killed.
00:11:21.598,00:11:22.974,ANNIE: Cover me up good.
00:11:22.974,00:11:24.683,All you ever do is run away.
00:11:24.683,00:11:27.061,"Oh, my goodness!"
00:11:27.061,00:11:28.729,She'll put you in the cellar with the ghosts.
00:11:28.729,00:11:30.064,You'll get whipped again.
00:11:30.064,00:11:31.399,You're gonna get us in trouble.
00:11:32.567,00:11:33.985,"ANNIE: Molly, shut up!"
00:11:33.985,00:11:35.612,I'm gonna tell.
00:11:35.612,00:11:38.697,ANNIE: And I'm gonna rearrange your teeth!
00:11:39.824,00:11:41.451,ANNIE: Stomp on her foot.
00:11:41.451,00:11:44.871,What are you all just standing around here for?
00:11:44.871,00:11:50.793,"You're supposed to clean the bathroom and the kitchen before lunch, my little pig droppings."
00:11:50.793,00:11:55.798,"And if you skip the corners, there will be no lunch."
00:11:55.798,00:11:58.885,And we're not having hot mush today.
00:11:58.885,00:12:00.887,Yay!
00:12:03.348,00:12:04.723,We're having cold mush.
00:12:04.723,00:12:06.059,Aw.
00:12:06.059,00:12:07.768,What?
00:12:07.768,00:12:11.314,"We love you, Miss Hannigan."
00:12:11.314,00:12:12.982,Wonderful.
00:12:14.234,00:12:15.569,Where's Annie?
00:12:15.569,00:12:17.111,She had to go bathroom.
00:12:17.111,00:12:19.113,She had to go bathroom.
00:12:19.113,00:12:21.324,MAN: Miss Hannigan!
00:12:21.324,00:12:23.784,Oh.
00:12:23.784,00:12:25.203,Mr. Bundles.
00:12:25.203,00:12:27.830,Mr. Bundles.
00:12:27.830,00:12:30.208,BUNDLES: Miss Hannigan!
00:12:30.208,00:12:31.918,Miss Hannigan!
00:12:38.883,00:12:40.510,Yoo-hoo.
00:12:40.510,00:12:42.721,Yoo-hoo.
00:12:42.721,00:12:46.765,It's time for a tumble with a bundle.
00:12:46.765,00:12:49.102,"Not today, Miss Hannigan."
00:12:46.765,00:12:50.895,"I'm behind, I-- Ooh! My schedule, I mean."
00:12:50.895,00:12:52.397,Schedules.
00:12:52.397,00:12:56.775,"What are schedules in the storms of passion, Mr. Bundles?"
00:12:56.775,00:13:00.071,Just so much flotsam and jetsam.
00:13:00.071,00:13:01.948,"Miss Hannigan, please!"
00:13:03.116,00:13:04.492,Mr. Bundles.
00:13:04.492,00:13:06.119,What are you doing out here?
00:13:06.119,00:13:07.370,Helping you.
00:13:07.370,00:13:08.705,It's heavy today.
00:13:08.705,00:13:11.750,"Yeah, it's a lot heavier than usual-- Shh!"
00:13:11.750,00:13:13.418,It shouldn't be.
00:13:13.418,00:13:16.003,Miss Hannigan.
00:13:16.003,00:13:17.672,Miss Hannigan?
00:13:17.672,00:13:19.340,You're my kind of woman.
00:13:19.340,00:13:21.342,Miss Hannigan.
00:13:21.342,00:13:22.885,"Till next month, Miss Hannigan."
00:13:25.722,00:13:27.432,I'll be right here.
00:13:50.829,00:13:53.958,"ANNIE: Mr. Bundles, I'm in here."
00:13:57.920,00:13:59.838,"Thank you, Mr. Bundles."
00:13:59.838,00:14:01.382,Good luck.
00:14:31.245,00:14:33.540,"CHILDREN: Row boat, row boat."
00:15:17.792,00:15:19.210,Get his tail!
00:15:22.255,00:15:23.923,Poor dog.
00:15:23.923,00:15:25.299,Leave him alone!
00:15:25.299,00:15:27.802,What's he ever done to you?
00:15:27.802,00:15:29.470,Amscray!
00:15:35.017,00:15:37.061,"All right, who's next?"
00:15:42.024,00:15:43.735,BOY: Quick as lightning!
00:15:43.735,00:15:45.319,Anybody else?
00:15:45.319,00:15:47.363,"BOY: Scram, man!"
00:15:47.363,00:15:48.989,Then get lost.
00:15:48.989,00:15:50.366,BOY 3: Get a move on!
00:15:50.366,00:15:51.701,BOY 4: Let's hotfoot it!
00:15:51.701,00:15:53.536,Shake a leg!
00:15:54.829,00:15:56.873,Let's go!
00:16:03.671,00:16:05.632,"Hey, you're all right."
00:16:15.475,00:16:19.019,I didn't do nothing any decent person wouldn't have done.
00:16:20.354,00:16:22.482,Dumb dog.
00:17:21.958,00:17:24.627,"Hey, mister."
00:17:24.627,00:17:26.045,"Oh, yeah?"
00:17:26.045,00:17:27.797,Where's his license?
00:17:27.797,00:17:30.675,He's no more your dog than I am your father.
00:17:30.675,00:17:33.011,I left his license at home by mistake.
00:17:33.011,00:17:35.555,"Please don't take him to the pound, please."
00:17:35.555,00:17:37.223,My father's blind.
00:17:37.223,00:17:39.058,This dog leads him to work.
00:17:39.058,00:17:42.812,"If he can't get to work, we're gonna all of us starve, sir."
00:17:42.812,00:17:44.438,What's his name?
00:17:45.732,00:17:47.859,My father's name?
00:17:47.859,00:17:49.151,The dog's name.
00:17:49.151,00:17:51.111,"Oh, the dog's name."
00:17:51.111,00:17:52.780,"Uh, his name's..."
00:17:52.780,00:17:54.073,Sandy.
00:17:54.073,00:17:55.700,Right! That's it! Sandy.
00:17:55.700,00:17:57.952,Call him.
00:17:57.952,00:17:59.370,Call him?
00:18:00.371,00:18:02.916,Go over there and call him.
00:18:02.916,00:18:04.625,"You mean, by his name?"
00:18:04.625,00:18:06.669,By his name.
00:18:06.669,00:18:08.004,The dog's name.
00:18:17.013,00:18:19.557,"Sandy. Come here, Sandy."
00:18:21.308,00:18:23.978,"Sandy! Come here, Sandy!"
00:18:23.978,00:18:25.312,"Here, Rover."
00:18:25.312,00:18:26.522,Rin Tin Tin.
00:18:26.522,00:18:28.649,Come here.
00:18:28.649,00:18:30.818,"Sandy! Come here, Sandy!"
00:18:30.818,00:18:33.821,"Rin Tin Tin, come here."
00:18:33.821,00:18:36.407,Sandy!
00:18:36.407,00:18:38.409,"Come here, Sandy."
00:18:38.409,00:18:41.161,Come here.
00:18:41.161,00:18:43.205,Good old Sandy!
00:18:43.205,00:18:44.958,"You got yourself a dog, kid."
00:18:44.958,00:18:46.667,Now go home and get him a collar and leash.
00:18:46.667,00:18:49.253,"Yes, sir."
00:19:15.404,00:19:17.657,"Hey, you kids, get out of there!"
00:19:25.205,00:19:27.541,Miss Hannigan!
00:19:27.541,00:19:29.085,Miss Hannigan!
00:19:29.085,00:19:31.253,What?!
00:19:31.253,00:19:32.797,Annie!
00:19:32.797,00:19:36.050,"Look what I found under a paving stone, Miss Hannigan."
00:19:36.050,00:19:38.594,"Oh, Annie!"
00:19:38.594,00:19:42.640,"Annie, my little peach fuzz, are you all right?"
00:19:42.640,00:19:44.684,I was worried sick.
00:19:44.684,00:19:46.853,I knew you would be.
00:19:46.853,00:19:49.814,A big-hearted woman like you.
00:19:49.814,00:19:54.360,How can I ever thank you...enough?
00:19:54.360,00:19:58.489,I'm sure we could think of something if we could get our heads together.
00:19:58.489,00:20:00.908,"Kissy, kissy, kissy."
00:20:00.908,00:20:02.618,Kill...
00:20:02.618,00:20:04.829,kill!
00:20:12.045,00:20:16.174,"We love you, Miss Hannigan."
00:20:16.174,00:20:17.508,Sure.
00:20:23.263,00:20:26.392,"Oh, my goodness!"
00:20:29.478,00:20:30.938,"Annie, where'd you get him?"
00:20:30.938,00:20:32.899,He smells.
00:20:32.899,00:20:34.274,"What's his name, Annie?"
00:20:34.274,00:20:36.152,Guess.
00:20:36.152,00:20:38.237,"Uh, Fifi?"
00:20:38.237,00:20:41.782,That ain't a name for this mutt.
00:21:01.177,00:21:02.970,Shh!
00:21:08.475,00:21:10.644,Rover!
00:21:14.023,00:21:15.315,"Come here, Rover."
00:21:15.315,00:21:16.901,"Come here, Rover."
00:21:18.485,00:21:20.821,"Come on, doggie."
00:22:15.334,00:22:16.585,She's coming.
00:22:16.585,00:22:17.753,She's coming.
00:22:17.753,00:22:20.131,Hide him.
00:22:20.131,00:22:21.548,Come on. Hurry!
00:22:21.548,00:22:23.259,Hide him quick!
00:22:23.259,00:22:24.677,"Oh, my goodness!"
00:22:24.677,00:22:26.720,Hurry! Hurry!
00:22:38.065,00:22:41.319,"I love you, Miss Hannigan."
00:22:41.319,00:22:47.325,"And you will love the paddle closet, Annie."
00:22:47.325,00:22:49.451,And this...
00:22:49.451,00:22:51.871,will love the sausage factory.
00:22:51.871,00:22:53.413,"No, Miss-- Oh!"
00:22:53.413,00:22:55.958,What?
00:22:55.958,00:22:59.962,"We love you, Miss Hannigan."
00:22:59.962,00:23:01.881,Shut up.
00:23:03.007,00:23:07.011,"Apples, a nickel."
00:23:07.011,00:23:08.888,"Yes, ma'am."
00:23:08.888,00:23:10.223,Here you go.
00:23:10.223,00:23:12.016,Thank you very much.
00:23:12.016,00:23:14.227,Apples here.
00:23:14.227,00:23:17.146,"Big, delicious apples."
00:23:17.146,00:23:19.439,Apples.
00:23:22.026,00:23:24.278,My daddy's gonna buy one of those.
00:23:26.906,00:23:28.574,WOMAN: What's she wearing?
00:23:30.450,00:23:32.328,WOMAN: Beautiful!
00:23:47.634,00:23:49.553,All right!
00:23:52.223,00:23:53.891,Yeah?
00:23:53.891,00:23:56.352,"Miss Hannigan, I'm Grace Farrell."
00:23:56.352,00:23:58.687,The New York Board of Orphans sent me.
00:23:58.687,00:24:00.356,Oh!
00:24:00.356,00:24:03.567,"Well, my goodness, won't you come in?"
00:24:03.567,00:24:04.902,Thank you.
00:24:04.902,00:24:06.653,Right this way.
00:24:06.653,00:24:08.446,Well...
00:24:08.446,00:24:09.656,Welcome.
00:24:09.656,00:24:10.950,Welcome to our happy home.
00:24:10.950,00:24:12.118,"GIRL: Get off my foot, Molly!"
00:24:12.118,00:24:13.451,Thank you.
00:24:13.451,00:24:14.661,GIRL 2: Smell that perfume.
00:24:14.661,00:24:16.205,What did you say your name was?
00:24:16.205,00:24:18.624,"Uh, Grace Farrell."
00:24:18.624,00:24:20.418,GIRL 3: I bet she wants a girl to clean her house.
00:24:20.418,00:24:21.710,I bet it's gonna be me.
00:24:21.710,00:24:23.670,I'm here to inquire about an orphan.
00:24:23.670,00:24:25.714,"Wait, Grace, I can explain the whole thing."
00:24:25.714,00:24:32.721,"You see, what happened was, the child actually bribed Mr. Bundles to smuggle her out of here in a laundry basket."
00:24:32.721,00:24:38.769,"I know I should've called Mr. Donatelli, but the plain truth of the matter is I just saw red, so I called the cops instead."
00:24:38.769,00:24:40.020,"Anyway, she's back."
00:24:40.020,00:24:41.521,Everything's fine.
00:24:41.521,00:24:43.065,"All's well that ends well, don't you know?"
00:24:43.065,00:24:46.610,"No harm, no foul, huh, my little scissors legs?"
00:24:46.610,00:24:49.196,"Miss Hannigan, what are you talking about?"
00:24:51.365,00:24:52.825,"Hold it, sister."
00:24:52.825,00:24:54.994,Are you peddling beauty products?
00:24:54.994,00:24:57.579,Because I don't need no beauty products.
00:24:57.579,00:25:02.500,"If that's what you're doing, you can just peddle yourself right on out of here, sweetie."
00:25:02.500,00:25:07.131,"Miss Hannigan, I am the private secretary to Oliver Warbucks."
00:25:07.131,00:25:09.258,The Oliver Warbucks?
00:25:10.717,00:25:13.553,"Oliver Warbucks, the millionaire?"
00:25:13.553,00:25:16.723,"No. Oliver Warbucks, the billionaire."
00:25:16.723,00:25:18.434,"Holy Mary, Mother of God."
00:25:18.434,00:25:22.729,Mr. Warbucks would like to invite an orphan to spend a week with him in his home.
00:25:23.981,00:25:25.523,I'm here to select one.
00:25:25.523,00:25:27.318,"Well, that's just wonderful."
00:25:27.318,00:25:30.488,"Uh, what kind of an orphan did he have in mind?"
00:25:30.488,00:25:32.365,"Oh, well, um..."
00:25:32.365,00:25:34.492,friendly.
00:25:34.492,00:25:35.993,Intelligent.
00:25:35.993,00:25:37.286,M-I...
00:25:37.286,00:25:38.496,"double-S, I..."
00:25:38.496,00:25:39.788,"double-S, I..."
00:25:39.788,00:25:41.332,"double-P, I."
00:25:41.332,00:25:42.540,And happy.
00:25:53.677,00:25:56.389,Oh!
00:25:56.389,00:25:57.931,How old?
00:25:57.931,00:26:01.394,"Well, um, age doesn't really matter."
00:26:01.394,00:26:02.769,MISS HANNIGAN: Uh-huh.
00:26:02.769,00:26:04.688,Seven?
00:26:04.688,00:26:06.357,Seven.
00:26:06.357,00:26:07.983,GRACE: Eight?
00:26:07.983,00:26:09.193,Nine?
00:26:09.193,00:26:10.444,Nine.
00:26:10.444,00:26:11.904,10?
00:26:11.904,00:26:13.989,"Yes, 10's fine."
00:26:13.989,00:26:15.657,10? 10.
00:26:15.657,00:26:18.160,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
00:26:18.160,00:26:20.704,Mr. Warbucks prefers redheaded children.
00:26:20.704,00:26:23.082,"10-year-old redhead, huh?"
00:26:23.082,00:26:25.125,Nope. Sorry.
00:26:25.125,00:26:27.836,"Well, what about this child?"
00:26:27.836,00:26:29.129,Annie?
00:26:29.129,00:26:31.715,Yes.
00:26:31.715,00:26:33.050,You wouldn't...
00:26:33.050,00:26:35.428,You don't want Annie.
00:26:35.428,00:26:37.930,"Well, why not?"
00:26:37.930,00:26:39.390,"She's, uh..."
00:26:40.474,00:26:42.059,She's a drunk.
00:26:42.059,00:26:45.396,"Oh, fiddle-faddle, Miss Hannigan."
00:26:45.396,00:26:49.108,"Annie, how would you like to spend a week with Mr. Warbucks at his house?"
00:26:49.108,00:26:51.985,"Oh, boy!"
00:26:51.985,00:26:53.904,"I would really, really love to!"
00:26:53.904,00:26:56.656,"Hey, wait a minute."
00:26:56.656,00:27:00.827,You can have any orphan in the whole orphanage except Annie.
00:27:00.827,00:27:02.079,"Well, why?"
00:27:02.079,00:27:06.708,Because she's got it coming to her and I don't mean a week in the lap of luxury.
00:27:06.708,00:27:08.710,This brat's got to learn to know her place.
00:27:08.710,00:27:09.962,Her place?
00:27:09.962,00:27:11.755,And Annie's entirely too cheeky.
00:27:11.755,00:27:15.217,"Well, Mr. Warbucks likes cheeky orphans."
00:27:15.217,00:27:16.676,Tough!
00:27:16.676,00:27:21.307,I assume that your resistance has something to do with Mr. Donatelli and the Board of New York Orphans.
00:27:21.307,00:27:22.808,"Don't assume nothing, sweetheart."
00:27:22.808,00:27:25.561,"Well, Mr. Warbucks and Mr. Donatelli are like that."
00:27:25.561,00:27:27.729,Is that a fact?
00:27:27.729,00:27:35.195,And it's also a fact that he was out at the house just the other day and he was saying how many people he had lined up for your job.
00:27:35.195,00:27:36.863,Is that a fact?
00:27:36.863,00:27:41.619,"It's an awful time to be out of work, isn't it, Miss Hannigan?"
00:27:43.245,00:27:44.580,Just terrible.
00:27:44.580,00:27:47.124,Leapin' lizards!
00:27:47.124,00:27:48.750,Leapin' lizards!
00:27:48.750,00:27:51.504,"Come along, Annie. Mr. Warbucks' limousine is waiting."
00:27:54.840,00:27:56.133,My dog.
00:27:56.133,00:27:57.301,What?
00:27:57.301,00:27:59.677,"Here, Sandy."
00:27:59.677,00:28:00.971,He's really nice.
00:28:00.971,00:28:02.181,"Really, really good."
00:28:02.181,00:28:04.891,He never jumps up on people.
00:28:04.891,00:28:06.185,"Oh, no! Oh!"
00:28:06.185,00:28:10.688,"Annie, he's a very, very sweet dog, but really, I don't think it'll work."
00:28:10.688,00:28:13.275,Mr. Warbucks-- Then I'm not coming.
00:28:13.275,00:28:14.860,What?
00:28:14.860,00:28:17.737,She's going to send him to the sausage factory.
00:28:17.737,00:28:19.239,She said so herself.
00:28:19.239,00:28:21.367,I'm not zoned for dogs.
00:28:21.367,00:28:22.993,We'll take the dog.
00:28:22.993,00:28:24.620,"Oh, boy."
00:28:24.620,00:28:26.246,"Oh, boy."
00:28:31.001,00:28:32.628,"Bye, Annie!"
00:28:32.628,00:28:34.171,"Bye, Annie!"
00:28:34.171,00:28:35.464,I'll be back.
00:28:35.464,00:28:37.966,I'll bring everybody presents.
00:28:37.966,00:28:40.886,Bye! Bye!
00:28:40.886,00:28:42.929,"Bye, Annie!"
00:28:42.929,00:28:44.890,"Bye! Bye, Annie!"
00:28:44.890,00:28:47.267,"Bye, Molly!"
00:28:47.267,00:28:49.769,"Bye, Pepper! Bye, Duffy!"
00:29:29.560,00:29:31.562,Is this a train station?
00:29:31.562,00:29:33.480,Are we going on a train?
00:29:33.480,00:29:35.857,"No, dear, this is Mr. Warbucks' house."
00:29:42.155,00:29:44.575,Leapin' lizards.
00:29:53.459,00:29:54.834,Wow!
00:29:58.922,00:30:01.425,"Annie, this is Punjab."
00:30:01.425,00:30:05.512,Punjab and the Asp are Mr. Warbucks' bodyguards.
00:30:05.512,00:30:06.722,"Come along, dear."
00:30:06.722,00:30:08.474,Let's get you settled.
00:31:15.248,00:31:17.209,"Been to the zoo, Miss Farrell?"
00:31:17.209,00:31:18.544,"Not recently, Drake."
00:31:18.544,00:31:19.878,Has the organ been tuned?
00:31:19.878,00:31:21.129,"Yes, miss."
00:31:21.129,00:31:22.381,Pool heated?
00:31:22.381,00:31:23.882,Tennis court net up?
00:31:23.882,00:31:25.592,French doors fixed?
00:31:25.592,00:31:27.135,Elevator oiled?
00:31:27.135,00:31:28.345,Typewriter repaired?
00:31:28.345,00:31:29.596,Second teletype installed?
00:31:29.596,00:31:30.806,Yes.
00:31:30.806,00:31:32.349,"Are you allergic to dogs, Drake?"
00:31:32.349,00:31:34.351,"No, filth."
00:31:34.351,00:31:36.936,"Is dinner under way, Mrs. Pugh?"
00:31:36.936,00:31:38.522,"Yes, miss. I'm preparing his favorite."
00:31:38.522,00:31:45.654,"Texas grapefruit, Virginia ham, Idaho potatoes, Wisconsin cheese, Washington apples and baked Alaska."
00:31:45.654,00:31:47.364,"I have an announcement to make, everybody."
00:31:47.364,00:31:48.824,I have an announcement.
00:31:48.824,00:31:50.283,This is Annie.
00:31:50.283,00:31:52.035,And she'll be staying with us for a week.
00:31:52.035,00:31:53.203,"STAFF: Hello, miss."
00:31:53.203,00:31:55.247,"And this is her dog, Sandy."
00:31:55.247,00:31:56.665,Who'll be staying with me.
00:31:57.833,00:32:00.168,"May I take your sweater, miss?"
00:32:00.168,00:32:01.795,Will I get it back?
00:32:01.795,00:32:04.715,"Of course, miss."
00:32:04.715,00:32:08.051,"Now, Annie. What would you like to do first?"
00:32:13.014,00:32:14.474,The windows.
00:32:14.474,00:32:16.017,Then the floors.
00:32:16.017,00:32:19.730,"That way if I drip-- No, no, Annie."
00:32:19.730,00:32:21.064,You don't understand.
00:32:21.064,00:32:24.568,You don't have to do any cleaning while you're here with us.
00:32:24.568,00:32:25.861,I won't?
00:32:25.861,00:32:27.863,How am I gonna earn my keep?
00:32:27.863,00:32:30.198,"Why, you're our guest, Annie."
00:32:33.993,00:32:35.788,Blue is her best color.
00:32:35.788,00:32:36.996,"No, red, I think."
00:32:40.375,00:32:43.336,"Soap. No, bubbles, I think."
00:32:46.465,00:32:49.217,"The silk? No, the satin sheets, I think."
00:33:25.921,00:33:27.380,Oh!
00:33:33.052,00:33:35.388,Inside the house?
00:33:38.976,00:33:40.769,I never even picked up a racket.
00:33:40.769,00:33:42.020,What?
00:33:45.064,00:33:47.901,"Oh, and get that Don Budge fellow, if he's available."
00:34:21.059,00:34:25.438,Annie!
00:34:25.438,00:34:27.273,Annie!
00:34:27.273,00:34:29.150,"Come on, Annie."
00:34:34.948,00:34:37.743,That's okay.
00:35:22.621,00:35:23.872,Hold still!
00:35:23.872,00:35:25.999,You mutt!
00:36:05.163,00:36:07.206,"Hey, Annie!"
00:36:07.206,00:36:08.917,Got something for you.
00:36:18.885,00:36:20.637,"Here you are, Annie."
00:36:57.382,00:37:00.010,It's Mr. Warbucks.
00:37:07.475,00:37:08.768,"Welcome home, sir."
00:37:08.768,00:37:10.187,Did the painting arrive?
00:37:10.187,00:37:12.647,"Yes, they're just uncrating it, sir."
00:37:16.735,00:37:18.195,Hmm...
00:37:24.117,00:37:26.036,I don't like it.
00:37:26.036,00:37:27.829,Any messages?
00:37:27.829,00:37:29.873,"Ah, yes, President Roosevelt called three times, sir."
00:37:29.873,00:37:31.499,This morning.
00:37:31.499,00:37:34.002,Everything's urgent to a Democrat. What else?
00:37:34.002,00:37:42.385,"Uh, uh, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Vanderbilt, Mr. Du Pont, Mr. Carnegie-- Wait! There's something interesting in that woman's smile."
00:37:42.385,00:37:44.054,I might learn to like her.
00:37:44.054,00:37:45.346,Hang her in my bathroom.
00:37:45.346,00:37:52.896,"Mr. Warbucks, I'd like you to meet-- No time for dinner tonight, so tell Mrs. Pugh to send up an American cheese sandwich at midnight. Come along, Miss Farrell, let's get started."
00:37:52.896,00:37:54.480,Aah!
00:37:54.480,00:37:56.066,"Oh, no!"
00:37:56.066,00:37:58.401,What the devil's going on here?
00:37:58.401,00:38:00.737,"Oh, Mr. Warbucks, this is the press representative!"
00:38:00.737,00:38:02.697,Your image!
00:38:02.697,00:38:03.949,Oh!
00:38:03.949,00:38:05.909,"Oh, yes."
00:38:07.160,00:38:09.121,"Pick him up, Punjab."
00:38:09.121,00:38:10.956,Get him another camera.
00:38:21.716,00:38:24.636,Why do I smell wet dog?
00:38:28.265,00:38:31.017,Because we gave Sandy a bath.
00:38:31.017,00:38:32.518,What's this?
00:38:32.518,00:38:34.187,"This is Annie, sir."
00:38:34.187,00:38:36.648,This is the orphan who will be staying with us for a week.
00:38:36.648,00:38:38.483,Orphan? What are you talking about?
00:38:38.483,00:38:42.487,"Well, they wanted to take photographs of you sharing your home with an orphan."
00:38:42.487,00:38:44.864,"Don't you remember, sir?"
00:38:44.864,00:38:47.784,This doesn't look like a boy.
00:38:47.784,00:38:49.535,"Oh, you didn't say you wanted a boy, sir."
00:38:49.535,00:38:51.746,"You just said an orphan, so I got a girl."
00:38:51.746,00:38:54.332,I want a boy!
00:38:54.332,00:38:57.460,"I've got an interesting smile too, sir."
00:38:57.460,00:39:00.922,"Don't you think maybe you could learn to like me too, sir?"
00:39:00.922,00:39:03.049,Hang me in the bathroom?
00:39:03.049,00:39:05.260,Take them back now.
00:39:05.260,00:39:07.179,"Oh, oh, sir, she just got here."
00:39:07.179,00:39:10.682,"That's okay, Miss Farrell."
00:39:10.682,00:39:13.601,"It was really nice meeting you, anyhow."
00:39:13.601,00:39:15.645,I sure do like your place.
00:39:15.645,00:39:16.855,"Thank you, Annette."
00:39:16.855,00:39:18.231,Annie.
00:39:18.231,00:39:20.150,I've really had a swell time already.
00:39:20.150,00:39:24.154,"The Asp drove us here in a car the size of a train, Mr. Warbucks."
00:39:24.154,00:39:26.572,And Punjab put a spell on Sandy.
00:39:26.572,00:39:28.533,And we made Drake sneeze.
00:39:28.533,00:39:30.035,And I played your pipe organ.
00:39:30.035,00:39:32.037,And Sandy got a bubble bath.
00:39:32.037,00:39:33.412,"And, well..."
00:39:33.412,00:39:36.582,I've had enough fun to last me for years.
00:39:36.582,00:39:40.128,"It's a really swell idea to have an orphan for a week, Mr. Warbucks."
00:39:40.128,00:39:42.714,A really terrific idea.
00:39:42.714,00:39:48.178,"Even if it's only for your image, even if I'm not the orphan, I'm glad you're doing it."
00:39:48.178,00:39:50.638,I'm glad you approve.
00:39:50.638,00:39:52.307,Let's get to work!
00:39:52.307,00:39:53.850,"Are you sure you need a boy, sir?"
00:39:53.850,00:39:55.685,It's only for a week.
00:39:55.685,00:39:56.978,Whatever!
00:39:56.978,00:39:59.147,But just for the week!
00:40:02.483,00:40:04.027,MAN: Know what?
00:40:04.027,00:40:05.320,What?
00:40:05.320,00:40:07.155,I love you.
00:40:07.155,00:40:09.032,I know.
00:40:09.032,00:40:11.076,Kiss me as only you can.
00:40:11.076,00:40:14.037,"Oh, you devil."
00:40:18.791,00:40:20.043,"Oh, get away!"
00:41:14.722,00:41:15.932,DOLL: Mama.
00:41:47.630,00:41:49.048,Aah!
00:41:55.638,00:41:57.056,Ow.
00:42:00.393,00:42:01.727,Ah.
00:42:04.981,00:42:06.316,Ahh.
00:43:11.756,00:43:13.049,Hee hee hee!
00:43:30.358,00:43:31.776,Aah!
00:43:37.823,00:43:39.534,Rooster.
00:43:39.534,00:43:41.453,Sis.
00:43:41.453,00:43:44.289,You're supposed to be in jail.
00:43:44.289,00:43:45.664,They let me out early.
00:43:45.664,00:43:47.584,On account of his good behavior.
00:43:47.584,00:43:50.128,I want you to meet a little friend of mine.
00:43:50.128,00:43:52.255,Lily St. Regis.
00:43:52.255,00:43:54.257,Named from the hotel.
00:43:54.257,00:43:55.925,Room service.
00:43:55.925,00:44:01.556,"Sis, this very afternoon I put me 10 on the nose of a beautiful horse at 8-1."
00:44:01.556,00:44:04.892,"Sure enough, the scum-bum took off and whipped the pack."
00:44:04.892,00:44:06.311,No kidding.
00:44:06.311,00:44:09.439,"This thing is, I got delayed."
00:44:09.439,00:44:12.024,And the joint was closed before I could cash in.
00:44:12.024,00:44:17.405,"$80 bucks, sis, first thing in the morning, guaranteed."
00:44:17.405,00:44:22.118,All I need is a finnif to tide me over.
00:44:22.118,00:44:25.330,Not even a nickel for the subway.
00:44:25.330,00:44:27.290,"Aw, come on, sis."
00:44:29.792,00:44:35.214,I'll bet you Miss Sticky-fingers here can loan you a lousy 5 bucks.
00:44:35.214,00:44:42.680,"I beg your pardon, I'm sure, but I don't stoop to what you're incinerating."
00:44:42.680,00:44:45.099,"Give me back my goods, toots."
00:44:51.230,00:44:52.689,Ahem.
00:45:02.867,00:45:04.869,"Okay, Rooster."
00:45:04.869,00:45:10.124,"If I loan you 5 bucks, will you take this dumb hotel and just get the heck out of here?"
00:45:10.124,00:45:12.585,"I'm sorry, sis."
00:45:12.585,00:45:15.921,Not even a nickel for the subway.
00:45:15.921,00:45:18.174,You and her have the same mother?
00:45:36.859,00:45:39.111,Rooster!
00:46:40.673,00:46:43.926,This room's bigger than Grant's tomb.
00:46:45.553,00:46:47.472,Me too.
00:46:48.931,00:46:51.392,"Come on, Sandy!"
00:46:55.730,00:47:08.326,"WARBUCKS: In conclusion, because your country has raised its voice loud and clear for freedom and democracy, I will extend to you a credit line for the acquisition of 35 of my new fighter-bombers."
00:47:08.326,00:47:13.498,"That will come complete with a year supply of spare parts, ammunition and advisors."
00:47:13.498,00:47:15.082,What's this?
00:47:15.082,00:47:17.710,Sandy's not used to sleeping in a room all by himself.
00:47:17.710,00:47:18.919,He gets lonesome.
00:47:18.919,00:47:21.422,"Oh. Uh, where were we?"
00:47:21.422,00:47:23.966,"Um, um, ammunition and advisors, sir."
00:47:23.966,00:47:25.468,Are you getting a lot done?
00:47:25.468,00:47:28.680,I'd get a lot more done if certain people...
00:47:30.348,00:47:34.268,If Franklin Delano Roosevelt would leave me alone.
00:47:34.268,00:47:36.312,Six calls since I got home.
00:47:36.312,00:47:38.063,What's he want?
00:47:38.063,00:47:40.149,He wants my support for the New Deal. It's laughable.
00:47:40.149,00:47:42.943,"He is our president, sir."
00:47:42.943,00:47:45.279,Punjab!
00:47:45.279,00:47:50.368,Remove this animal and its young mistress along with it.
00:47:50.368,00:47:51.619,WARBUCKS: Dear Richie.
00:47:51.619,00:47:58.917,This letter will serve as confirmation of all the correspondence concerning the details of your extended deferment.
00:47:58.917,00:48:00.503,The entire account...
00:48:01.962,00:48:03.673,...on or before September the 1st.
00:48:03.673,00:48:08.010,"If you cannot meet that deadline, you'll have to be charged the current rate of interest."
00:48:08.010,00:48:10.887,"That is, six percent."
00:48:10.887,00:48:12.473,"Cordially, et cetera."
00:48:14.809,00:48:27.530,"Oh, P.S.-- I've just remembered, one of my companies is developing a bomb-proof glass which may be of interest to your shipping line if the present international situation should deteriorate."
00:48:27.530,00:48:31.784,MAN: What was that all about?
00:48:31.784,00:48:33.327,"Well done, Sandy."
00:48:33.327,00:48:35.246,Was that man trying to kill you?
00:48:35.246,00:48:36.748,"That's will be all, Miss Farrell."
00:48:36.748,00:48:39.834,"Yes, sir."
00:48:39.834,00:48:41.836,Who would want to kill Mr. Warbucks?
00:48:41.836,00:48:43.629,"The Bolsheviks, dear."
00:48:43.629,00:48:48.843,"He's living proof that the American system really works, and the Bolsheviks don't want anybody to know about that."
00:48:48.843,00:48:52.388,The Bolsheviks?
00:49:02.774,00:49:06.068,Get your blasted dog out of my pool!
00:49:06.068,00:49:08.529,"He thought you were drowning, Mr. Warbucks."
00:49:08.529,00:49:10.197,He was trying to save your life.
00:49:10.197,00:49:12.909,"Go on, you mutt."
00:49:12.909,00:49:14.702,"Come on, Sandy."
00:49:14.702,00:49:16.537,Yeah!
00:49:24.961,00:49:26.963,Like my suit?
00:49:26.963,00:49:28.716,"What? Oh, yes."
00:49:28.716,00:49:30.551,Miss Farrell picked it out.
00:49:30.551,00:49:32.678,I never thought I'd get used to a girl.
00:49:32.678,00:49:35.389,Girls are easier to get used to than boys.
00:49:35.389,00:49:37.433,Look how used to Miss Farrell you are.
00:49:37.433,00:49:41.771,"She does all the work around here, and you don't even know her first name."
00:49:41.771,00:49:43.606,I do. It's Grace.
00:49:43.606,00:49:47.151,She thinks you're the greatest thing since sliced bread.
00:49:47.151,00:49:48.527,I beg your pardon?
00:49:48.527,00:49:52.698,"I know it's none of my business, but you never notice anything."
00:49:56.993,00:49:58.663,Sliced bread.
00:49:59.747,00:50:01.624,"WARBUCKS: Wilhelm, how are you?"
00:50:01.624,00:50:05.586,Please offer your son my congratulations on his engagement.
00:50:05.586,00:50:07.045,"Hold on, Wilhelm."
00:50:07.045,00:50:09.089,Buy copper!
00:50:09.089,00:50:10.716,Yes.
00:50:10.716,00:50:20.016,And tell the crown prince that my yacht in Monte Carlo is entirely at his disposal for the honeymoon.
00:50:20.016,00:50:21.894,"Hold on, Wilhelm."
00:50:21.894,00:50:23.437,More copper!
00:50:23.437,00:50:25.564,"Don't encourage her, Punjab!"
00:50:25.564,00:50:28.275,"I'm sorry, sir."
00:50:28.275,00:50:30.235,Good idea.
00:50:30.235,00:50:33.447,"To Washington, to meet President Roosevelt."
00:50:35.157,00:50:37.117,How about a movie?
00:50:37.117,00:50:42.247,"Pepper went to a movie once, before she came to the orphanage, and she said it was swell."
00:50:42.247,00:50:43.875,And Miss Hannigan goes all the time.
00:50:43.875,00:50:45.167,Splendid!
00:50:45.167,00:50:48.212,Take her to the Radio City Music Hall.
00:50:48.212,00:50:49.421,Aren't you gonna take me?
00:50:49.421,00:50:51.089,Me?
00:50:51.089,00:50:55.386,"Annie, you may think that Miss Farrell does all the work around here, but it's not entirely true."
00:50:55.386,00:50:57.555,"I'm a busy man, a very busy man."
00:50:57.555,00:51:00.892,"I know. I didn't mean to get in the way, Mr. Warbucks."
00:51:00.892,00:51:02.518,Nobody has to take me anywhere.
00:51:02.518,00:51:05.021,I'll go practice my backhand.
00:51:09.608,00:51:11.652,Pepper lies a lot.
00:51:11.652,00:51:15.322,She probably hasn't been to a movie either.
00:51:15.322,00:51:19.618,"Actually, I think it's better when you don't know what you're missing."
00:51:21.871,00:51:23.205,Punjab...
00:51:23.205,00:51:25.624,buy out the 8:00 show.
00:51:25.624,00:51:28.084,Let's all go to the movies.
00:51:32.297,00:51:34.592,"You know, you should leave your hair down."
00:51:34.592,00:51:35.801,It looks so pretty.
00:51:35.801,00:51:37.428,"Oh, no, no, Annie."
00:51:37.428,00:51:39.055,I just couldn't.
00:51:39.055,00:51:41.181,Miss Hannigan says a man don't look at your brains.
00:51:41.181,00:51:44.309,"Oh, really? My goodness!"
00:51:44.309,00:51:46.228,Let's go to the movies.
00:51:46.228,00:51:47.730,Let's go see the stars.
00:51:47.730,00:51:49.356,Yeah.
00:53:40.384,00:53:43.888,Turn the kitchen light off!
00:57:34.451,00:57:36.370,For the lady of the camellias.
00:57:39.373,00:57:42.251,And they're almost twice as large as usual.
00:57:42.251,00:57:45.796,I shall have twice as many as usual tomorrow.
00:57:45.796,00:57:47.298,Twice as ma-- Oh.
00:57:47.298,00:57:49.174,Don't listen to her.
00:57:49.174,00:57:50.717,I know what those things cost.
00:57:50.717,00:57:54.138,Aren't you willing to listen to her when she orders her caps and dresses from you?
00:57:54.138,00:57:55.431,They're an investment.
00:57:55.431,00:57:57.391,You won't be young forever.
00:57:57.391,00:58:01.186,It's high time you settle something about your future.
00:58:01.186,00:58:04.106,And I know the very man for you.
00:58:04.106,00:58:06.733,Really?
00:58:09.527,00:58:12.323,No one has ever loved you as I love you.
00:58:12.323,00:58:16.327,"Well, it might be true."
00:58:16.327,00:58:20.580,You should go away and not see me anymore.
00:58:22.874,00:58:24.876,But don't go in anger.
00:58:24.876,00:58:33.510,"Now, why don't you laugh at yourself a little, as I laugh at myself, and come talk to me once in a while in a friendly way."
00:58:33.510,00:58:35.595,That's too much and not enough.
00:58:35.595,00:58:38.140,"Believe in love, Marguerite."
00:58:38.140,00:58:40.517,So you do love him?
00:58:42.478,00:58:48.733,"Dare to tell me that you love him, and you're free of me forever."
00:58:48.733,00:58:50.402,I love him.
00:58:55.573,00:58:58.743,"Come in. Come in here, all of you."
00:58:58.743,00:59:00.496,See this woman?
00:59:00.496,00:59:02.998,Then listen to what I'm going to say.
00:59:02.998,00:59:05.334,I accepted her favors because I thought she loved me.
00:59:05.334,00:59:08.462,I let her make sacrifices for me when there were others who had more to give.
00:59:08.462,00:59:12.132,"But bear witness, I owe her nothing."
00:59:12.132,00:59:14.051,Take it.
00:59:14.051,00:59:16.345,"Buy camellias. Buy diamonds, horses and carriages."
00:59:16.345,00:59:18.972,Buy moonlight.
00:59:18.972,00:59:20.765,"MAN: I congratulate you, monsieur."
00:59:20.765,00:59:22.559,You know how to treat a woman as she deserves.
00:59:22.559,00:59:24.686,Like the cheat this one is.
00:59:30.442,00:59:32.903,Marguerite.
00:59:32.903,00:59:34.363,Armand.
00:59:34.363,00:59:36.281,Marguerite!
00:59:39.201,00:59:41.286,"Oh, it's you."
00:59:41.286,00:59:50.546,"I've been down in the street half the night, walking back and forth under your window, just as I did when I first knew you, wanting to come up, but not daring to."
00:59:50.546,00:59:53.048,I felt so guilty.
00:59:53.048,00:59:55.675,"Don't think such things, Marguerite."
00:59:55.675,01:00:03.517,"Even if we can't go to the country today, think of how happy we were once, and how happy we shall be again."
01:00:03.517,01:00:08.313,"Think of the day you found the four-leaf clover, and of all the good luck it's going to bring us."
01:00:08.313,01:00:11.191,Think of the vows we heard Nichette and Gustave make.
01:00:11.191,01:00:14.194,"And that we're going to make, to each other."
01:00:14.194,01:00:16.363,"This is for life, Marguerite."
01:00:19.991,01:00:21.493,Marguerite.
01:00:26.206,01:00:27.999,Marguerite.
01:00:29.626,01:00:31.253,No.
01:00:31.253,01:00:33.380,"No, don't leave me!"
01:00:33.380,01:00:35.382,"Marguerite, come back."
01:01:50.541,01:01:52.083,Could you get her nightgown?
01:01:52.083,01:01:53.793,It's behind the bathroom door.
01:01:53.793,01:01:55.753,Certainly.
01:02:31.415,01:02:33.083,Miss Farrell...
01:02:33.083,01:02:36.169,"No, no, no."
01:02:36.169,01:02:37.713,How did you learn that?
01:02:37.713,01:02:39.339,Learn what?
01:02:39.339,01:02:40.716,What?
01:02:40.716,01:02:42.092,You put her to bed.
01:02:42.092,01:02:43.719,"Well, you put her to bed too."
01:02:43.719,01:02:45.845,I did?
01:02:45.845,01:02:48.432,Good heavens.
01:03:09.911,01:03:12.664,"That was a wonderful evening you gave her last night, sir."
01:03:12.664,01:03:14.165,Just wonderful.
01:03:14.165,01:03:17.753,"I'm gonna have to close a factory in Pittsburgh, Miss Farrell."
01:03:17.753,01:03:19.504,What about Annie?
01:03:19.504,01:03:22.633,Could we keep her?
01:03:22.633,01:03:24.842,You haven't seen that horrible orphanage.
01:03:24.842,01:03:27.845,I can't bear to send her back there. I can't.
01:03:27.845,01:03:30.390,"Get ahold of yourself, Miss Farrell. What's come over you?"
01:03:30.390,01:03:32.183,She wouldn't be a bother.
01:03:32.183,01:03:33.644,You have plenty of room here.
01:03:33.644,01:03:35.228,The staff adores her.
01:03:35.228,01:03:38.106,"We could take her on as your ward, couldn't we?"
01:03:38.106,01:03:39.441,Absolutely not.
01:03:39.441,01:03:40.942,I'm a businessman.
01:03:40.942,01:03:42.860,I love money. I love power.
01:03:42.860,01:03:45.739,"I do not now, and never will, love children."
01:03:50.494,01:03:53.204,"Watching you with her last night, I thought maybe..."
01:03:53.204,01:03:54.872,Grace.
01:03:56.166,01:03:57.917,Yes?
01:04:05.801,01:04:08.386,I just noticed something.
01:04:08.386,01:04:09.887,Yes?
01:04:09.887,01:04:12.516,You're awfully pretty when you argue with me.
01:04:16.060,01:04:18.980,"Thank you, sir, but-- Oliver."
01:04:20.231,01:04:21.650,Oliver.
01:04:25.111,01:04:31.743,Do you really just love money and power and capitalism?
01:04:31.743,01:04:34.496,You know they're never going to love you back.
01:04:34.496,01:04:36.790,Your teeth are crooked.
01:04:36.790,01:04:38.082,I'll have them fixed.
01:04:38.082,01:04:41.085,I like them crooked.
01:04:41.085,01:04:42.420,I'll leave them.
01:04:42.420,01:04:44.506,Thank you.
01:04:46.591,01:04:49.594,I could have the papers signed this morning.
01:04:49.594,01:04:51.304,Grace.
01:04:51.304,01:04:53.139,Oliver.
01:04:53.139,01:04:56.393,"It means a great deal to you, doesn't it?"
01:04:56.393,01:05:00.271,"Yes, it means a great deal to me."
01:05:00.271,01:05:01.690,I'll do it myself.
01:05:05.276,01:05:08.780,"Oh, I could just kiss you!"
01:05:11.867,01:05:13.368,Grace.
01:05:13.368,01:05:15.286,Get her a little gift.
01:05:15.286,01:05:16.996,That's a good idea.
01:05:16.996,01:05:19.290,Something from Tiffany's.
01:05:19.290,01:05:23.169,"Oh, and you, you be careful when you go to that orphanage."
01:05:23.169,01:05:25.630,That woman's got claws and fangs.
01:05:40.896,01:05:43.022,We got Annie.
01:05:47.360,01:05:49.529,We've got Annie?
01:07:46.312,01:07:50.942,GIRLS: It's a hard-knock life for us.
01:07:52.109,01:07:55.864,It's a hard-knock life for us.
01:07:57.114,01:08:04.581,No one cares for you a smidge when you're in an orphanage.
01:08:06.249,01:08:10.127,What are you doing?
01:08:14.049,01:08:20.013,Why aren't you marching in line with the rest of them?
01:08:20.013,01:08:21.681,Duffy...
01:08:21.681,01:08:23.558,come here.
01:08:24.601,01:08:27.353,Come on.
01:08:27.353,01:08:34.027,"You're hiding something from Miss Hannigan behind your back, aren't you, Duffy?"
01:08:34.027,01:08:36.195,No.
01:08:36.195,01:08:38.073,Let me have it.
01:08:39.574,01:08:43.202,Aah! Aah!
01:08:43.202,01:08:45.162,Get inside!
01:08:50.961,01:08:54.672,WOMAN: I think I seen his picture in the paper with President Roosevelt.
01:09:07.644,01:09:10.271,"Hannigan, I presume?"
01:09:10.271,01:09:11.689,Yes.
01:09:11.689,01:09:14.609,I want to talk to you about Annie.
01:09:14.609,01:09:18.321,"You want to return her and forget it, or, uh, trade up?"
01:09:18.321,01:09:21.240,I want to adopt her.
01:09:21.240,01:09:23.743,Would you excuse me for a moment?
01:09:32.502,01:09:34.796,Would you care to step into my office.
01:09:34.796,01:09:36.756,"Well, thank you."
01:09:42.386,01:09:44.681,"Hi, sweetie."
01:09:44.681,01:09:46.265,What's she-- Ow!
01:09:46.265,01:09:48.351,"Ah, you little cutie."
01:09:48.351,01:09:50.728,"Up, up, up, up, up."
01:09:50.728,01:09:52.229,This way.
01:09:57.152,01:09:59.236,Welcome.
01:09:59.236,01:10:02.657,"Miss Hannigan-- Mr. Warbucks, do you know something?"
01:10:02.657,01:10:05.535,"For a Republican, you are sinfully handsome."
01:10:05.535,01:10:07.370,Thank you.
01:10:07.370,01:10:12.333,"Why, I just go absolutely weak in the knees over men like you."
01:10:12.333,01:10:14.627,My God!
01:10:14.627,01:10:16.629,Just sign the papers.
01:10:16.629,01:10:21.718,"Wouldn't you like to see the bedroom, my little billiard ball?"
01:10:21.718,01:10:23.053,Sign.
01:10:23.053,01:10:25.805,I make a very dry martini.
01:10:25.805,01:10:27.015,Right here.
01:10:27.015,01:10:29.934,I make a very wet souffle.
01:10:29.934,01:10:31.561,Just your name.
01:10:31.561,01:10:34.731,"Don't be so mean, you mean old meanie."
01:10:34.731,01:10:37.108,"Come, my dear."
01:10:42.113,01:10:44.615,I have an appointment at 1.
01:10:44.615,01:10:46.534,This way.
01:10:54.250,01:10:55.418,Where?
01:10:57.795,01:10:59.255,Argentine.
01:11:01.674,01:11:02.926,What? Stop!
01:11:02.926,01:11:04.552,No!
01:11:30.995,01:11:32.163,You had me followed?
01:11:34.457,01:11:35.959,Bronchitis.
01:11:38.294,01:11:39.754,Great gams.
01:11:42.173,01:11:43.466,He's an uncle.
01:11:45.301,01:11:46.719,They love it.
01:11:49.055,01:11:50.431,Drink?
01:11:52.767,01:11:54.018,It's fresh.
01:12:14.872,01:12:16.332,Jail?
01:12:41.482,01:12:45.611,"Well, why didn't you say so in the first place, swine?"
01:12:50.407,01:12:53.995,Women! Does it take this long to get to Tiffany's and back?
01:12:53.995,01:12:55.288,Where is she?
01:12:55.288,01:12:57.123,"I hear the car, sahib."
01:12:57.123,01:12:58.666,It's probably not the right car.
01:12:58.666,01:13:00.584,It's the Duesenberg.
01:13:00.584,01:13:02.378,Miss Farrell took the Duesenberg.
01:13:02.378,01:13:03.921,What took you so long?
01:13:03.921,01:13:06.674,What's happening around here? Where's Annie?
01:13:06.674,01:13:09.552,She's taking her karate lesson with the Asp.
01:13:09.552,01:13:11.054,"GRACE: Oh, Oliver, don't be nervous."
01:13:11.054,01:13:12.222,Nervous?
01:13:12.222,01:13:13.556,"No, you give it to her."
01:13:13.556,01:13:15.183,"No, no, Oliver, it was your idea."
01:13:15.183,01:13:16.726,She likes you better than she likes me.
01:13:16.726,01:13:19.270,"Oliver, will you pull yourself together."
01:13:25.860,01:13:29.655,"Oh, Mr. Warbucks, want to see what the Asp taught me today?"
01:13:29.655,01:13:31.074,Hii-yah!
01:13:31.074,01:13:32.783,Aaah!
01:13:32.783,01:13:36.412,"To the couch, Punjab, if you please."
01:13:36.412,01:13:38.956,"Oh, gee, I didn't think it would work."
01:13:38.956,01:13:40.708,"Well, now you know it does, ha."
01:13:40.708,01:13:41.918,Should I call a doctor?
01:13:41.918,01:13:43.460,"Oh, it'll be fine."
01:13:43.460,01:13:45.171,Punjab.
01:13:53.888,01:13:55.348,Thank you.
01:13:55.348,01:13:58.226,Ah. Ha ha.
01:13:58.226,01:14:01.020,We'll leave you two alone.
01:14:12.531,01:14:17.745,"Annie, I want to talk to you about something very serious."
01:14:17.745,01:14:20.415,"You don't want me anymore, right?"
01:14:20.415,01:14:22.166,"On the contrary, I do."
01:14:22.166,01:14:24.085,Good Lord!
01:14:24.085,01:14:27.964,"Annie, can we have a man-to-man talk?"
01:14:27.964,01:14:29.632,Sure.
01:14:29.632,01:14:33.344,What I'm proposing would involve a long-term...
01:14:33.344,01:14:35.096,"well, agreement."
01:14:35.096,01:14:39.892,"Actually, maybe you ought to know more about me before you make up your mind."
01:14:39.892,01:14:41.727,Okay.
01:14:41.727,01:14:44.480,"Let's, uh, let's go for a walk."
01:14:44.480,01:14:45.982,Okay.
01:14:47.691,01:14:51.779,I was born in Liverpool in a railroad switchhouse.
01:14:51.779,01:14:58.535,My younger brother died of pneumonia because we didn't have money for medicine.
01:14:58.535,01:15:03.666,"Well, I decided then and there that one day I would be rich, very, very rich."
01:15:03.666,01:15:05.542,Good idea.
01:15:05.542,01:15:08.129,"In those days, America was the land of opportunity."
01:15:08.129,01:15:11.757,I signed on a ship as cabin boy when I was 12.
01:15:11.757,01:15:15.886,"By the time I was 21, I'd made my first million."
01:15:15.886,01:15:18.514,"In the next 10 years, I turned that into 100 million."
01:15:18.514,01:15:19.890,Wow.
01:15:19.890,01:15:22.310,"In those days, that was a lot of money."
01:15:22.310,01:15:25.355,"I was ruthless, hurt a lot of people."
01:15:25.355,01:15:32.403,"Making money was all I ever gave a damn about, up to now."
01:15:32.403,01:15:33.946,Let's go inside.
01:15:33.946,01:15:35.739,Okay.
01:15:38.326,01:15:50.254,"It's occurred to me that no matter how many houses I have, how many Rembrandts, how many Duesenbergs, that unless I have someone to share it with, well, I might as well be back in Liverpool, broke."
01:15:50.254,01:15:52.673,"Annie, do you understand what I'm trying to say?"
01:15:52.673,01:15:55.301,Sure.
01:15:55.301,01:15:56.593,Kind of.
01:15:56.593,01:15:58.095,Kind of?
01:15:58.095,01:16:00.348,I guess not.
01:16:00.348,01:16:01.891,"Oh, excuse me."
01:16:10.441,01:16:13.361,"You've given me so much already, Mr. Warbucks."
01:16:13.361,01:16:15.696,I got the papers signed today. It's official.
01:16:15.696,01:16:17.698,What is?
01:16:21.785,01:16:26.457,"It's so pretty, but-- Let me put it on you."
01:16:26.457,01:16:28.792,"It's a really swell locket, Mr. Warbucks."
01:16:28.792,01:16:32.088,"But if it's all the same to you, I'll keep my old one."
01:16:32.088,01:16:34.090,It isn't all the same to me.
01:16:34.090,01:16:36.592,This one's engraved.
01:16:36.592,01:16:42.056,"To Annie, with love, from Daddy Warbucks."
01:16:42.056,01:16:51.732,"Mr. Warbucks, when my folks left me at the orphanage 10 years ago, they left a note saying that they'd come back to get me as soon as they could."
01:16:51.732,01:16:56.987,And they kept the other half of this old locket so I'd know them when they came.
01:16:56.987,01:16:59.490,"I'm gonna find them someday, Mr. Warbucks."
01:16:59.490,01:17:06.914,"I'm gonna have a regular mother and father, like a regular kid."
01:17:06.914,01:17:09.333,I don't mean to hurt your feelings.
01:17:09.333,01:17:20.595,"You've been nicer to me than anybody in the whole wide world, but I've been dreaming of my folks for as long as I can remember, and I just got to find them."
01:17:25.891,01:17:27.893,And I'll help you.
01:17:30.729,01:17:36.110,"Grace, get me J. Edgar on the phone!"
01:17:36.110,01:17:38.904,"Drake, get me the chief of police!"
01:17:38.904,01:17:42.741,"Asp, get me Walter Winchell!"
01:17:42.741,01:17:45.411,Punjab!
01:17:45.411,01:17:49.039,Get me William Randolph Hearst!
01:17:49.039,01:17:52.502,"And Saunders, get me a drink."
01:17:54.211,01:17:56.839,"Six, seven, eight, you're on."
01:18:30.080,01:18:32.166,"A-ha, the lovely Boylan sisters."
01:18:32.166,01:19:03.322,"Doot doot Doot doot Doot doot doot Tonight, as a special heart-tugging treat from that old heart-tugger himself, yours truly, Bert Healy, I'd like to introduce a little orphan."
01:19:03.322,01:19:05.575,A little orphan named Annie.
01:19:14.917,01:19:17.211,MAN: Hey!
01:19:17.211,01:19:19.505,Who's that who just walked into our Red Network studios?
01:19:19.505,01:19:21.131,Bert Healy?
01:19:21.131,01:19:25.553,"Well, Wacky, it's none other than the Wall Street tycoon, Oliver Warbucks!"
01:19:29.515,01:19:31.517,"Thank you, Bert Healy."
01:19:31.517,01:19:38.232,It's swell-- Swell? Do I say-- Swell to be on the Iodent Hour.
01:19:38.232,01:19:41.902,I understand you're conducting a coast-to-coast search for Annie's parents.
01:19:41.902,01:19:45.989,"Yeah, I told you that before we went on the air-- Oh, yes! Bert Healy."
01:19:45.989,01:19:52.204,I am now conducting a coast-to-coast nationwide search for Annie's parents.
01:19:52.204,01:19:53.997,Drop page.
01:19:53.997,01:19:55.958,Warbucks continues.
01:19:55.958,01:20:03.173,"Furthermore, tonight I am offering a cash reward to Annie's parents, $50,000 cash."
01:20:03.173,01:20:05.092,"Oh, Mr. Warbucks!"
01:20:05.092,01:20:07.803,"Oh, boy. Oh, boy."
01:20:07.803,01:20:09.764,"50,000 smackers!"
01:20:09.764,01:20:15.936,"So Annie's parents, if you're listening, please contact Oliver Warbucks-- Warbucks interrupts!"
01:20:15.936,01:20:21.776,"At my house, Bert Healy, 987 Fifth Avenue, New York City."
01:20:21.776,01:20:22.985,Ha ha!
01:20:22.985,01:20:32.953,"Thank you, Bert Healy, and thank you, all-new Iodent, the toothpaste with miracle K-64 to fight hali..."
01:20:32.953,01:20:34.413,Hali...
01:20:34.413,01:20:36.832,For letting me talk to you this evening.
01:20:36.832,01:20:41.587,"Good night, Bert Healy, and good night for the Red Network."
01:20:41.587,01:20:43.046,Drop page!
01:20:43.046,01:20:45.591,Did I just do a commercial?
01:20:45.591,01:20:47.968,Let's get out of here.
01:20:47.968,01:20:51.221,I've never endorsed a product in all my career.
01:20:54.684,01:20:58.895,"So for all of you, our smiles family, this is Bert Healy saying..."
01:21:49.321,01:21:51.907,"Ah, the lovely Boylan sisters."
01:23:23.540,01:23:27.544,Do I hear happiness in here?
01:23:40.808,01:23:42.768,They never miss.
01:23:45.729,01:23:48.482,MAN: Everybody's going to get their chance here.
01:23:50.734,01:23:54.446,"Annie! Annie, it's your mama!"
01:23:54.446,01:23:59.618,"Annie, here I come!"
01:23:59.618,01:24:01.578,"We've got to get her out of here, Mr. Warbucks."
01:24:01.578,01:24:03.330,We can't expose her to this.
01:24:03.330,01:24:06.124,Get the autocopter ready.
01:24:25.268,01:24:26.520,Wow!
01:24:26.520,01:24:27.980,"Annie, guess what?"
01:24:27.980,01:24:32.192,Mr. Warbucks is gonna take you to Washington to see the president!
01:24:32.192,01:24:33.986,"Oh, boy!"
01:24:56.675,01:25:00.596,Marvelous! Aren't Republicans ostentatious?
01:25:00.596,01:25:05.517,"Franklin, behave. It's astonishing he's here at all."
01:25:08.604,01:25:11.732,"What do you call this thing, Oliver? It looks like great fun."
01:25:11.732,01:25:14.610,An autocopter.
01:25:14.610,01:25:17.404,"Don't need an airport, just a back yard."
01:25:17.404,01:25:22.659,"They say it can land on a dime, whatever that may be."
01:25:22.659,01:25:25.120,I appreciate you coming down.
01:25:25.120,01:25:26.997,Means nothing.
01:25:26.997,01:25:32.002,Means only that Annie wanted to meet you.
01:25:33.921,01:25:36.590,"It's nice to meet you, Mr. President Roosevelt."
01:25:36.590,01:25:39.217,"It's my pleasure, Annie."
01:25:39.217,01:25:41.344,And thank you for bringing the old goat.
01:25:41.344,01:25:43.263,We'll make a New Dealer of him yet.
01:25:43.263,01:25:44.681,Inconceivable.
01:25:44.681,01:25:46.767,"Don't mind him, Oliver."
01:25:46.767,01:25:48.518,"Come along, Annie."
01:25:48.518,01:25:53.816,"My Uncle Theodore, Teddy Roosevelt, used to teach his children to walk on stilts."
01:25:53.816,01:25:58.153,"Well I can't teach you to walk on stilts, but I can teach you to roll in a chair with wheels."
01:25:58.153,01:25:59.905,My own private roller coaster.
01:25:59.905,01:26:05.035,"The New Deal, in my opinion, is badly planned, badly organized and badly administered."
01:26:05.035,01:26:07.412,"You don't think your programs through, Franklin."
01:26:07.412,01:26:11.500,You don't think what they're gonna do to the economy in the long run.
01:26:11.500,01:26:13.710,People don't eat in the long run.
01:26:13.710,01:26:15.504,People can't feed their children.
01:26:15.504,01:26:18.090,The lucky ones end up in orphanages.
01:26:18.090,01:26:20.634,"The older ones are abandoned to steal, to starve."
01:26:20.634,01:26:22.803,The business of this country is business.
01:26:22.803,01:26:26.140,"You have to organize-- Take them off the dole, and put them to work."
01:26:26.140,01:26:27.975,That is precisely what I intend to.
01:26:27.975,01:26:34.356,"In the National Parks, building camps, clearing trails, fighting fires, planting trees."
01:26:34.356,01:26:35.816,Hold it! Hold it!
01:26:35.816,01:26:39.277,"I want to feed them, and house them, and pay them."
01:26:37.609,01:26:44.992,"Not much, but enough to send home to their parents, so they can hold their heads up again, and be proud to be Americans."
01:26:44.992,01:26:46.785,That's a swell idea.
01:26:46.785,01:26:48.620,"It isn't a swell idea, Annie."
01:26:48.620,01:26:50.413,It's mistaken foolishness!
01:26:50.413,01:26:52.791,Big-hearted and empty-headed!
01:26:52.791,01:26:54.751,"Which parks, which children?"
01:26:54.751,01:26:56.879,What would it cost?
01:26:56.879,01:26:58.130,Who's gonna organize it?
01:26:58.130,01:27:00.757,Who's gonna run it?
01:27:00.757,01:27:03.468,"I, uh, was hoping you would."
01:27:03.468,01:27:04.803,Me?
01:27:04.803,01:27:06.972,And Annie.
01:27:06.972,01:27:08.891,Leapin' lizards!
01:27:08.891,01:27:11.060,Out of the question!
01:27:11.060,01:27:12.435,How could I help?
01:27:12.435,01:27:13.937,Wait a minute!
01:27:13.937,01:27:15.814,You could help us recruit the young people.
01:27:15.814,01:27:17.107,"Now, hold everything!"
01:27:17.107,01:27:18.608,"Many of them have given up hope, Annie."
01:27:18.608,01:27:21.403,They think their government doesn't care whether they live or die.
01:27:21.403,01:27:26.825,"With your help, we could convince them that with a little extra effort-- I want to say something."
01:27:26.825,01:27:31.205,There's this song I used to sing in the orphanage when I'd get sad.
01:27:31.205,01:27:32.622,It always cheered me up.
01:27:32.622,01:27:34.457,Eleanor!
01:28:30.597,01:28:32.724,"Oh, Franklin."
01:28:35.227,01:28:37.813,"You'll help us too, won't you, Oliver?"
01:28:37.813,01:28:39.522,Bah!
01:28:39.522,01:28:41.524,Think of the children.
01:28:46.696,01:28:51.285,"Sing, Oliver. That's an order from your commander in chief."
01:28:53.703,01:28:55.038,Eleanor.
01:28:55.038,01:28:56.581,Sing.
01:29:03.338,01:29:05.132,Solo for the president!
01:29:15.309,01:29:16.726,Everybody!
01:29:16.726,01:29:19.062,"Republicans too, Oliver. Sing!"
01:29:28.947,01:29:30.490,Harmony!
01:30:01.313,01:30:04.024,"All right, everybody, come on, step up here!"
01:30:04.024,01:30:06.109,I got fresh fish here!
01:30:06.109,01:30:08.528,"Give me two, right there."
01:30:17.996,01:30:19.248,Yeah?
01:30:19.248,01:30:22.500,"Excuse me, are you the lady who runs this establishment?"
01:30:22.500,01:30:23.919,Unfortunately.
01:30:23.919,01:30:28.673,"Ten years ago, we left our little baby girl on the front steps."
01:30:28.673,01:30:30.384,We were starving.
01:30:30.384,01:30:34.512,"There was a job managing a hotel in Maine, but only if we had no children."
01:30:34.512,01:30:36.765,"Wrap it up, I'm listening to Helen Trent."
01:30:36.765,01:30:39.642,We never meant to leave our little Annie.
01:30:39.642,01:30:41.144,Annie?
01:30:41.144,01:30:43.230,"Now, we have a hardware store in New Jersey."
01:30:43.230,01:30:45.357,We could take care of her.
01:30:45.357,01:30:47.776,We've always loved her.
01:30:47.776,01:30:49.485,You're Annie's parents?
01:30:49.485,01:30:52.030,"Our place isn't fancy, but it's home."
01:30:52.030,01:30:53.782,We live over the store.
01:30:53.782,01:30:55.367,There's a yard out back.
01:30:55.367,01:30:56.993,We have chickens.
01:30:56.993,01:30:58.745,And a rooster.
01:31:03.666,01:31:05.419,Rooster?
01:31:09.339,01:31:12.842,My God! I never would've recognized you.
01:31:18.098,01:31:22.352,"Aw, sis, if we can fool you, we can fool Big Bucks."
01:31:22.352,01:31:24.396,"50,000 smackers!"
01:31:24.396,01:31:26.315,"You're gonna be the death of me, Rooster."
01:31:26.315,01:31:28.108,"Oh, come on, sis."
01:31:28.108,01:31:31.153,This is gonna be the best bunco job ever.
01:31:31.153,01:31:33.280,All we need is details.
01:31:33.280,01:31:35.240,"About Annie, specifics."
01:31:35.240,01:31:36.866,I see.
01:31:36.866,01:31:38.576,What's in it for me?
01:31:38.576,01:31:39.786,Money!
01:31:39.786,01:31:41.746,A three-way split of the 50 thou.
01:31:41.746,01:31:42.956,I want half.
01:31:42.956,01:31:44.166,Half?
01:31:44.166,01:31:45.459,"All right, half."
01:31:45.459,01:31:47.294,Rooster!
01:31:47.294,01:31:52.007,"25 grand for me and Lil, 25 grand for you."
01:31:52.007,01:31:54.676,He-- Hey!
01:31:54.676,01:31:58.638,"Why don't we wait and see what she's got, huh?"
01:31:58.638,01:32:01.266,See if it's worth 25 grand.
01:32:01.266,01:32:02.516,Aah!
01:32:02.516,01:32:04.186,You want details?
01:32:04.186,01:32:05.979,I got details.
01:32:05.979,01:32:08.648,I got specifics on every kid in this dump.
01:32:08.648,01:32:11.067,It's just a question of finding the right box!
01:32:11.067,01:32:12.361,Ha!
01:32:13.695,01:32:17.531,Annie wears a locket around her neck.
01:32:18.700,01:32:20.910,It's a broken locket.
01:32:20.910,01:32:25.748,She says her parents saved the other half to someday come and claim her with.
01:32:25.748,01:32:28.293,"Well, years ago..."
01:32:28.293,01:32:31.505,"Years and years ago, her parents were killed in a fire."
01:32:31.505,01:32:34.132,And the cops brought me all their junk.
01:32:34.132,01:32:42.182,"MISS HANNIGAN: Well, my darling baby brother, if Annie's parents can claim her with that locket, so can we!"
01:32:42.182,01:32:44.309,"LILY: 50,000 smackers!"
01:32:44.309,01:32:46.644,"ROOSTER: And the kid, we'll drop in the river."
01:32:46.644,01:32:49.231,They're gonna do something bad to Annie!
01:32:49.231,01:32:50.440,Pepper!
01:32:50.440,01:32:51.858,Have you cleaned the can?
01:32:51.858,01:32:53.609,"Listen to me, I mean it!"
01:32:53.609,01:32:55.028,Clean the can!
01:32:55.028,01:32:58.281,"Duffy, Tessie, somebody!"
01:32:58.281,01:33:00.075,You want a knuckle sandwich?
01:33:00.075,01:33:01.659,We got to warn Annie!
01:33:01.659,01:33:03.078,Scrub!
01:33:03.078,01:33:06.373,It's in an envelope.
01:33:11.836,01:33:14.089,The little brat!
01:33:14.089,01:33:17.092,It ain't fair. This here life is driving me nuts.
01:33:17.092,01:33:18.760,Make yourself useful.
01:33:28.144,01:33:29.521,Right instead of left.
01:33:29.521,01:33:31.231,It'll have her name on it.
01:33:49.332,01:33:51.418,Open it. Open it.
01:33:53.253,01:33:54.712,Hurry.
01:36:43.214,01:36:44.924,"Hit it, sis."
01:37:21.085,01:37:22.878,Now do the other one.
01:37:25.006,01:37:27.509,GIRL: You hit that jack.
01:37:27.509,01:37:29.843,It's my turn.
01:37:29.843,01:37:31.262,Ow!
01:37:32.555,01:37:34.683,"Duffy, Tessie, somebody!"
01:37:34.683,01:37:36.685,They're going to do something bad to Annie.
01:37:36.685,01:37:37.851,Who is?
01:37:37.851,01:37:39.688,They are.
01:37:39.688,01:37:40.980,Miss Hannigan.
01:37:40.980,01:37:42.732,"Oh, my goodness!"
01:37:46.611,01:37:48.571,It's beautiful.
01:37:52.866,01:37:55.662,"GIRL: Shh. Be quiet, be quiet."
01:37:55.662,01:37:57.955,Where do you think you're going?
01:37:57.955,01:38:00.249,Go tell Annie!
01:38:02.794,01:38:04.170,"Oh, my goodness!"
01:38:04.170,01:38:06.214,"Let's go, you brats!"
01:38:06.214,01:38:07.674,Don't! Don't!
01:38:07.674,01:38:09.551,Come on!
01:38:09.551,01:38:11.427,Stop it!
01:38:11.427,01:38:13.680,Get in that closet!
01:38:13.680,01:38:16.349,Behave yourself!
01:38:16.349,01:38:17.726,Get in there!
01:38:21.062,01:38:22.605,Go in there!
01:38:22.605,01:38:25.107,Whose rotten idea was this?
01:38:27.861,01:38:29.945,Christ!
01:39:00.142,01:39:02.896,Are they here? Did they bring me a brother and sister?
01:39:02.896,01:39:07.233,"Buddha says, man who counts his chickens before they hatch gets a scrambled egg."
01:39:07.233,01:39:08.942,What?
01:39:12.154,01:39:14.323,Have my parents come for me?
01:39:15.949,01:39:17.786,"We haven't found them, Annie."
01:39:43.728,01:39:46.815,I interviewed 865 couples.
01:39:46.815,01:39:50.151,None of them knew about the locket.
01:39:50.151,01:39:54.071,I never realized how many dishonest people there are in New York.
01:40:15.510,01:40:18.011,I guess they're dead.
01:40:18.011,01:40:21.307,I guess I've known that deep down for a long time.
01:40:21.307,01:40:22.725,I'm not giving up.
01:40:22.725,01:40:24.894,Don't you give up.
01:40:24.894,01:40:27.480,"I didn't want to be just another orphan, Mr. Warbucks."
01:40:27.480,01:40:29.649,I wanted to believe I was special.
01:40:29.649,01:40:31.693,You are special.
01:40:31.693,01:40:34.904,Never stop believing that.
01:40:34.904,01:40:37.114,We're trapped in here!
01:40:37.114,01:40:39.450,Shh!
01:40:39.450,01:40:42.578,Annie's never gonna get saved.
01:40:42.578,01:40:44.831,"Oh, my goodness."
01:40:44.831,01:40:46.666,Poor Annie.
01:40:46.666,01:40:48.501,"We'll never get out of here, now."
01:40:48.501,01:40:50.127,I've got an idea.
01:40:50.127,01:40:52.421,What?
01:40:52.421,01:40:56.091,Great. Good idea.
01:40:56.091,01:40:58.469,"Oh, it's heavy."
01:40:58.469,01:41:00.388,Don't drop it.
01:41:00.388,01:41:03.432,Come on.
01:41:03.432,01:41:06.561,All right.
01:41:06.561,01:41:10.523,Shh!
01:41:10.523,01:41:13.860,She'll be so mad if she catches us...
01:41:13.860,01:41:16.111,I'm not so sure I want to do this.
01:41:16.111,01:41:18.364,We're going to be in so much trouble anyway.
01:41:18.364,01:41:20.449,"Duffy, hand me something."
01:41:20.449,01:41:22.660,"Oh, give her something to hit with."
01:41:30.083,01:41:31.878,There's a space up here.
01:41:31.878,01:41:34.505,Careful.
01:41:34.505,01:41:37.341,"Oh, my goodness!"
01:41:37.341,01:41:40.511,Somebody's gonna have to help me get up.
01:41:40.511,01:41:41.763,Ow! Get off my hand!
01:41:41.763,01:41:44.933,I'm trying not to push!
01:41:44.933,01:41:47.476,We're out.
01:41:49.812,01:41:51.606,Give me your hand.
01:41:55.317,01:41:56.778,It's a long way down.
01:41:56.778,01:41:59.030,You sure you want to go through with it?
01:42:03.116,01:42:06.119,Wish me luck.
01:42:06.119,01:42:07.830,Careful.
01:42:07.830,01:42:10.541,I'm trying.
01:42:24.931,01:42:26.390,"We were starving, ma'am."
01:42:26.390,01:42:28.810,We needed the job.
01:42:28.810,01:42:30.728,That's why we left our little girl.
01:42:30.728,01:42:33.397,Wrapped in a newspaper.
01:42:33.397,01:42:37.234,On the steps of the Hudson Street Orphanage.
01:42:45.576,01:42:47.202,What's this?
01:42:47.202,01:42:50.706,"Mr. Warbucks, this is Ralph and Shirley Mudge from Hoboken, New Jersey."
01:42:50.706,01:42:52.249,Annie!
01:42:53.793,01:42:56.295,Oh!
01:42:56.295,01:42:59.214,"Oh, Ralph, look."
01:42:59.214,01:43:02.135,She still has the locket.
01:43:16.065,01:43:18.400,We finally found you.
01:43:18.400,01:43:21.194,I suppose you heard about the reward on the radio?
01:43:21.194,01:43:23.865,Reward?
01:43:23.865,01:43:25.741,In the paper.
01:43:25.741,01:43:27.076,What paper?
01:43:27.076,01:43:29.078,How did you know Annie was here?
01:43:29.078,01:43:31.580,That kind lady at the orphanage told us.
01:43:31.580,01:43:34.125,I have her birth certificate right here.
01:43:35.543,01:43:40.923,I've kept it close to my heart all of these years.
01:43:44.886,01:43:47.220,Anne Marie Mudge.
01:43:47.220,01:43:52.810,"October the 18th, 1922."
01:43:58.107,01:44:00.233,I'll go pack.
01:44:02.319,01:44:05.156,"Want me to help, baby?"
01:44:07.116,01:44:09.785,"No, thanks..."
01:44:09.785,01:44:11.328,Mom.
01:44:39.190,01:44:41.734,We've got to find her.
01:44:41.734,01:44:43.236,Come on!
01:45:00.377,01:45:03.672,A certified check!
01:45:03.672,01:45:07.218,"Oh, sir, we're just so thrilled to have found Annie."
01:45:07.218,01:45:08.427,We don't need money.
01:45:08.427,01:45:10.512,I'll take it back.
01:45:10.512,01:45:12.473,Of course...
01:45:12.473,01:45:15.143,we are poor people.
01:45:15.143,01:45:17.728,It would help us a lot.
01:45:17.728,01:45:21.523,We could buy her milk...
01:45:21.523,01:45:23.276,a warm blanket...
01:45:24.735,01:45:27.155,Put it in your pocket...
01:45:27.155,01:45:29.282,Mrs. Mudge.
01:45:34.162,01:45:36.289,"Come on, you guys."
01:45:38.166,01:45:42.170,"Oh, my goodness!"
01:45:42.170,01:45:43.796,We're never gonna make it.
01:45:43.796,01:45:45.798,We found Fifth Avenue!
01:45:45.798,01:45:48.259,"Number one, Fifth Avenue!"
01:45:48.259,01:45:51.220,We got to go to 987.
01:45:51.220,01:45:52.805,Ohhhh!
01:45:52.805,01:45:54.389,"Come on, Molly, get on my back."
01:45:54.389,01:45:56.349,"Come on, you guys, help!"
01:46:00.313,01:46:03.440,Do you think the stores would take all this back?
01:46:03.440,01:46:06.152,All your new clothes?
01:46:06.152,01:46:09.280,"Well, I guess so, Annie, but don't you want to keep them?"
01:46:09.280,01:46:12.325,"My new folks, they're poor."
01:46:12.325,01:46:14.702,All these clothes are gonna make them feel bad.
01:46:14.702,01:46:18.873,Could you maybe take them back to the orphanage and give them to my friends?
01:46:18.873,01:46:20.708,Certainly.
01:46:20.708,01:46:23.752,This'll look so cute on Molly.
01:46:26.005,01:46:27.882,And this'll look good on Duffy.
01:48:33.715,01:48:35.468,Did you get it?
01:48:35.468,01:48:38.220,She has it.
01:48:38.220,01:48:41.307,"You know, I think maybe I'd better hold it for safekeeping."
01:48:41.307,01:48:43.558,Over my dead body.
01:48:43.558,01:48:46.519,That's the brightest thing I've ever heard you say.
01:48:46.519,01:48:48.063,"Ladies, ladies."
01:48:48.063,01:48:50.316,Help!
01:48:50.316,01:48:51.984,Get on the road!
01:48:55.696,01:48:59.200,We'll never find the house.
01:48:59.200,01:49:02.870,I wish I'd been outside New York City before.
01:49:05.080,01:49:07.582,When I get my half of it...
01:49:12.880,01:49:14.507,I say we go back.
01:49:14.507,01:49:15.757,We can't!
01:49:15.757,01:49:17.634,We've been walking for 100 years!
01:49:17.634,01:49:20.095,We're never going to get there.
01:49:20.095,01:49:22.056,But we have to.
01:49:22.056,01:49:24.058,Let's take a vote.
01:49:24.058,01:49:28.312,All in favor of calling it quits.
01:49:28.312,01:49:30.147,Ah-ha!
01:49:30.147,01:49:32.483,"Oh, I'm gonna get me one of those little gold lamé numbers."
01:49:32.483,01:49:34.402,If they sell them in Atlantic City.
01:49:34.402,01:49:36.904,We ain't stopping till we hit Atlantic City!
01:49:36.904,01:49:39.448,Yahoo!
01:49:39.448,01:49:41.867,Boo.
01:49:41.867,01:49:44.161,"Help, Mr. Warbucks!"
01:49:44.161,01:49:45.954,"Shut up, kid."
01:49:49.208,01:49:52.336,Look!
01:49:53.670,01:49:56.006,Mr. Warbucks is gonna be furious!
01:49:56.006,01:49:57.258,"Come here, Sandy!"
01:49:57.258,01:49:59.385,Come here!
01:50:06.100,01:50:07.935,Come on! Let's go!
01:50:09.811,01:50:12.147,"Come on, you guys!"
01:50:12.147,01:50:13.941,Hurry! Hurry!
01:50:15.526,01:50:17.694,I can't run anymore.
01:50:23.409,01:50:25.244,Hurry!
01:50:30.541,01:50:34.128,"All right, now."
01:50:34.128,01:50:35.963,You want to see Mr. Warbucks?
01:50:35.963,01:50:38.424,All right.
01:51:08.787,01:51:10.539,"Oh, my goodness!"
01:51:34.563,01:51:36.689,What now?
01:51:36.689,01:51:38.108,Sir...
01:51:38.108,01:51:39.901,I think he's a highness.
01:51:39.901,01:51:41.111,Your Highness...
01:51:41.111,01:51:42.821,We're friends of Annie's.
01:51:42.821,01:51:44.865,Annie's gone.
01:51:44.865,01:51:46.867,Her parents came and took her away.
01:51:46.867,01:51:49.620,"But they wasn't her real parents, mister."
01:51:49.620,01:51:51.205,They was bad people.
01:51:51.205,01:51:53.499,Leaping lizards!
01:51:58.379,01:52:00.881,"You take the autocopter, I'll take the car."
01:52:00.881,01:52:04.259,"Edgar, J. Edgar, Warbucks here."
01:52:04.259,01:52:06.595,"Yeah, orphan Annie has been kidnapped."
01:52:06.595,01:52:10.432,I want every G-man east of the Mississippi on this case in the next 20 minutes.
01:52:12.976,01:52:17.022,"MAN: Where's the fire, fellas?"
01:53:19.668,01:53:21.086,"Sahib, sahib."
01:53:21.086,01:53:25.215,"The truck is on Canal Street, heading east."
01:53:25.215,01:53:26.717,East on Canal Street.
01:53:26.717,01:53:28.009,"Well done, Punjab."
01:53:28.009,01:53:29.720,Don't lose track of them now.
01:53:32.556,01:53:34.433,"Excuse me, mister."
01:53:34.433,01:53:35.976,Can we stop a second?
01:53:35.976,01:53:37.519,I got to go.
01:53:39.563,01:53:41.898,"I really got to, Miss Hannigan."
01:53:44.192,01:53:46.695,"I mean it, lady."
01:53:46.695,01:53:49.156,"When you got to go, you got to go."
01:53:57.872,01:53:59.458,Make it fast.
01:54:01.168,01:54:03.462,Aah!
01:54:03.462,01:54:04.713,"Rooster, grab her!"
01:54:04.713,01:54:06.923,She got the check!
01:54:10.803,01:54:13.639,Cut her off at the bridge!
01:54:13.639,01:54:15.390,Goddamn it!
01:54:15.390,01:54:17.934,"Come back here, you goddamn kid!"
01:54:39.873,01:54:41.082,No!
01:54:41.082,01:54:43.043,Mr. Warbucks'll eat your livers!
01:54:43.043,01:54:44.670,I'll kill you.
01:54:44.670,01:54:46.004,"I'll kill you, you little brat! I'll kill you!"
01:54:46.004,01:54:47.297,"Wring her neck, Rooster!"
01:54:47.297,01:54:49.132,He's really gonna kill her.
01:54:50.175,01:54:52.260,Rooster!
01:54:53.721,01:54:55.472,"Rooster, stop!"
01:54:56.640,01:54:59.434,"Rooster, she's a baby!"

01:55:13.699,01:55:18.579,"She may be a mean, rotten little orphan, but I'm not gonna let you kill her!"
01:55:18.579,01:55:20.497,"ROOSTER: Let go of me, you old boozer!"
01:55:20.497,01:55:22.123,MISS HANNIGAN: Stop it!

01:58:55.087,01:58:57.130,You must hold on.
01:58:57.130,01:58:58.799,I can't.
