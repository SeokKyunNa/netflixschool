00:01:35.595,00:01:39.224,"I wasn't sure if you, you know, wanted to sleep in or not."
00:01:41.601,00:01:43.603,Am I in a dorm room?
00:01:45.104,00:01:46.564,"Uh, yeah."
00:02:00.203,00:02:01.204,Where are my clothes?
00:02:01.830,00:02:03.373,On the dresser.
00:02:08.545,00:02:10.672,I folded your pants last night.
00:02:10.755,00:02:15.051,"You know, I wasn't sure if that material gets wrinkled."
00:02:15.135,00:02:15.969,Great.
00:02:18.012,00:02:19.180,Uh...
00:02:19.973,00:02:22.058,Don't know if you remember my name or not.
00:02:22.142,00:02:23.852,-Pretty wasted last night. -Got Tylenol?
00:02:23.935,00:02:25.228,What?
00:02:25.311,00:02:28.857,My head is killing me. Do you have any Tylenol?

00:02:33.945,00:02:35.071,Sorry.
00:02:42.370,00:02:43.580,Thanks.
00:02:46.124,00:02:48.042,"I'm Carter, by the way."
00:02:50.795,00:02:52.922,"Not a word of this to anyone, got it?"
00:02:55.884,00:02:57.594,Yeah. Sure.
00:03:00.346,00:03:02.307,Dude! Did you hit that fine vagine or what?
00:03:09.272,00:03:10.732,"Nice one, dickhead."
00:03:29.834,00:03:30.960,Stop global warming?
00:04:05.036,00:04:06.162,Hey!
00:04:07.330,00:04:08.164,Hi.
00:04:09.040,00:04:10.625,You haven't returned any of my texts.
00:04:11.376,00:04:13.628,"Yeah, sorry, I've been busy."
00:04:15.838,00:04:17.173,"Yeah, I can see that."
00:04:17.257,00:04:19.926,"Okay, Tim, we went on a date."
00:04:20.301,00:04:21.552,One.
00:04:21.636,00:04:23.972,"I don't have to text you back. We're not, like, a thing."
00:04:24.847,00:04:27.976,"Okay. I just... You know, I figured we had a nice time."
00:04:28.059,00:04:30.812,You had a nice time. I was miserable.
00:04:31.271,00:04:34.023,"I mean, who takes their first date to Subway?"
00:04:34.649,00:04:36.359,It's not like you have a footlong.
00:05:08.558,00:05:09.934,"Oh, my God!"
00:05:10.018,00:05:13.062,You sneaky little beeyotch! Who was it?
00:05:14.230,00:05:15.189,Nobody.
00:05:15.273,00:05:16.858,Sisters don't keep secrets.
00:05:17.025,00:05:18.943,"Seriously, it was nobody."
00:05:19.027,00:05:21.571,"Well, I hope nobody used a condom."
00:05:21.654,00:05:24.365,We don't want somebody looking like a whore.
00:05:24.449,00:05:26.534,"Thanks, Danielle. Super helpful."
00:05:26.617,00:05:27.744,What are sisters for?
00:05:28.077,00:05:30.538,"Oh, and don't forget, house meeting at lunch."
00:05:30.621,00:05:31.622,Living for it.
00:05:31.706,00:05:32.874,Hmm.
00:05:37.378,00:05:38.463,She finally rolls in.
00:05:42.383,00:05:44.594,Did I totally embarrass myself last night?
00:05:46.637,00:05:52.518,"Unless you consider dancing on a table, starting two fights, and barfing pretzel chunks all over the bar embarrassing."
00:05:52.602,00:05:54.187,Mmm. Please tell me you're kidding.
00:05:55.104,00:05:58.816,"Oh, and you also rammed your tongue down Nick Sims' throat right in front of Danielle."
00:06:00.610,00:06:02.820,"Oh, God! But she was so nice to me this morning."
00:06:02.904,00:06:04.989,"Yeah, I think she was as drunk as you last night."
00:06:05.073,00:06:06.282,So consider it collective amnesia.
00:06:10.912,00:06:13.581,"Oh, crap! I'm so late for class."
00:06:17.710,00:06:19.962,I can't find my damn book!
00:06:21.130,00:06:22.215,Ha!
00:06:25.885,00:06:28.179,Did you really think you could keep it a secret from me?
00:06:28.262,00:06:29.388,How did you find out?
00:06:29.472,00:06:30.723,Driver's license.
00:06:30.973,00:06:32.517,"Not the best picture, I might add."
00:06:32.600,00:06:33.935,"I assume you changed my ringer, too?"
00:06:34.018,00:06:35.103,"Who, me?"
00:06:35.186,00:06:36.354,Never.
00:06:42.276,00:06:43.402,What'd you wish for?
00:06:43.486,00:06:44.612,A new roommate.
00:06:48.449,00:06:49.742,I made that from scratch!
00:06:49.826,00:06:52.286,"Sorry, too many carbs. Toodles!"
00:06:54.288,00:06:59.001,Locomotive response in the subject shows an acceleration across the quantum plane.
00:07:01.295,00:07:09.637,This creates great orbital overlap between the partially positive base of carbon and the partially negative hydrogen alkali group.
00:07:11.514,00:07:12.390,Thanks.
00:07:17.603,00:07:18.938,"game at the Sigma parties, okay?"
00:07:19.021,00:07:20.898,And we still need to pick this year's charity.
00:07:20.982,00:07:24.861,"I can say right now, there's no way we're doing the Special Needs Art Fair again."
00:07:24.944,00:07:27.697,Totally freaked my shit out. Thoughts?
00:07:33.411,00:07:34.579,What's wrong?
00:07:34.662,00:07:35.788,"Oh, I don't know."
00:07:35.872,00:07:37.039,"What's wrong, Tree?"
00:07:38.124,00:07:39.208,Nothing.
00:07:39.292,00:07:42.170,Except for that cat lady buffet you just dumped at our table.
00:07:42.253,00:07:43.921,And is that chocolate milk I see?
00:07:44.130,00:07:45.339,I missed breakfast.
00:07:45.756,00:07:48.050,"What is breakfast, Becky?"
00:07:54.223,00:07:56.142,-Oh! Asshole! -I'm sorry.
00:07:57.435,00:07:58.728,"Wait, you two know each other?"
00:07:58.811,00:07:59.854,-Yeah. -No!
00:08:01.981,00:08:05.276,We had a class together last year.
00:08:05.568,00:08:07.570,"Look, I was bringing you this back."
00:08:13.159,00:08:15.495,"Sorry, I didn't know where you lived. You know, I..."
00:08:19.457,00:08:22.335,Yeah. I'm sorry again about the mess.
00:08:24.837,00:08:26.380,What a douchebag!
00:08:33.304,00:08:35.014,Dr. Lawrence to outpatient services.
00:08:44.565,00:08:46.025,-Lori! -Hi.
00:08:47.026,00:08:48.194,Hi.
00:08:48.319,00:08:49.320,Um...
00:08:50.488,00:08:52.490,"So, I thought you only work nights."
00:08:52.573,00:08:54.617,Doing a double for Jen. She has the flu.
00:08:54.700,00:08:55.910,That's nice of you.
00:08:57.078,00:08:58.913,"So, I guess I don't need to ask what you're doing here?"
00:09:02.291,00:09:03.459,Got to go!
00:09:04.919,00:09:05.920,"Look, Tree."
00:09:07.046,00:09:12.093,"It's none of my business, but I think something like this is bound to have some pretty serious consequences."
00:09:13.761,00:09:16.597,You're right. It is none of your business.
00:09:26.983,00:09:29.402,"Dr. Surd and Dr. Margolan, 2476."
00:09:49.922,00:09:53.342,We can't do this today. There's too much going on in the building.
00:09:56.137,00:09:57.597,I have patients.
00:09:58.389,00:09:59.724,And I'm losing mine.
00:10:09.191,00:10:11.277,"-Hi. -Hey, sweetie."
00:10:11.360,00:10:12.945,What's with the door?
00:10:13.029,00:10:14.447,Stupid thing got jammed.
00:10:14.530,00:10:16.741,"Oh. Just wrapping up here. Have you met my student, Theresa?"
00:10:18.075,00:10:19.493,"No, I haven't."
00:10:20.536,00:10:23.205,"Hi, it's nice to meet you. Thank you so much for helping me out."
00:10:24.957,00:10:25.958,This is a nice surprise.
00:10:33.090,00:10:40.097,"And this morning, he drove to Atlanta for a last-minute business meeting Enter."
00:10:43.184,00:10:44.935,But I'm trying not to let that bring me down.
00:10:45.019,00:10:46.062,Is that my top?
00:10:46.145,00:10:47.480,How cute is it on me?
00:10:48.564,00:10:51.108,"Whatever. Just don't get anything on it, please."
00:10:51.192,00:10:53.069,You mean like Nick's nutter butter?
00:10:53.152,00:10:54.904,"Wow. Classy, Danielle."
00:10:54.987,00:10:56.447,What time are you going to the party tonight?
00:10:56.530,00:10:58.491,I don't know. Later.
00:11:00.076,00:11:01.702,Our tuition dollars at work.
00:11:02.787,00:11:06.540,"Anyhoo, don't be too late, or all the cute Sigma boys will be taken."
00:11:06.624,00:11:07.708,Okay. Bye.
00:11:07.833,00:11:08.876,Bye!
00:11:16.467,00:11:19.678,I sat in that restaurant waiting for you for over an hour.
00:11:19.762,00:11:23.349,"I can't believe you would do this to me, today of all days!"
00:11:26.143,00:11:27.686,"-Bayfield, baby! -Ooh!"
00:11:28.187,00:11:29.563,Babies for life!
00:12:17.194,00:12:22.074,"Okay, you guys are hilarious. You can come out now."
00:12:24.452,00:12:25.703,Losers.
00:12:49.935,00:12:52.354,"Yo, I think your friends went the other way."
00:12:58.277,00:13:00.029,Can I help you?
00:13:04.533,00:13:06.744,"Look, weirdo, I'm not scared."
00:13:06.827,00:13:09.872,Why don't you go try this with one of the heifers at Delta Gamma?
00:13:09.955,00:13:11.499,They're into cosplay.
00:13:19.882,00:13:21.717,"Okay, I'm calling the cops."
00:14:19.483,00:14:20.818,"Oh, hey, you're up."
00:14:22.778,00:14:25.197,"I wasn't sure if you, you know, wanted to sleep in or not."
00:14:32.580,00:14:33.581,Oh...
00:14:34.081,00:14:35.416,"Right, yeah."
00:14:35.499,00:14:37.835,I folded your pants for you last night.
00:14:37.918,00:14:41.380,"You know, I wasn't sure if that material gets wrinkled."
00:14:41.964,00:14:42.965,Uh...
00:14:45.843,00:14:49.847,"I don't know if you remember my name or not, you know, you were pretty wasted last night."
00:14:49.930,00:14:50.764,"But, uh..."
00:14:52.224,00:14:53.225,-I'm-- -Carter.
00:14:55.019,00:14:56.020,You remember.
00:15:00.524,00:15:02.735,My head is killing me. Do you have any Tylenol?
00:15:02.818,00:15:04.862,"Oh, uh... Yes."
00:15:05.446,00:15:06.614,Um...
00:15:07.489,00:15:08.908,It's over there.
00:15:09.742,00:15:10.993,Right.
00:15:12.119,00:15:15.122,It's under your clothes on the thing.
00:15:15.789,00:15:16.957,Right. Right.
00:15:22.922,00:15:23.923,And...
00:15:32.765,00:15:33.766,Are you okay?
00:15:35.351,00:15:36.435,Tree.
00:15:38.187,00:15:39.313,Are you okay?
00:15:42.608,00:15:45.110,Dude! Did you hit that fine vagine or what?
00:15:52.159,00:15:54.119,I'm... I'm sorry.
00:15:59.792,00:16:01.585,"Nice one, dickhead."
00:16:14.974,00:16:16.058,Stop global warming?
00:16:17.142,00:16:18.894,"Sorry, no thanks."
00:16:41.375,00:16:43.168,Keep going! Faster!
00:16:58.976,00:16:59.935,Hey!
00:17:01.478,00:17:03.731,You haven't returned any of my texts.
00:17:04.606,00:17:05.899,"Tim, what day is it?"
00:17:06.692,00:17:08.902,"Uh, Monday the 18th."
00:17:09.695,00:17:10.779,You're sure?
00:17:10.863,00:17:12.072,I'm pretty sure.
00:17:13.782,00:17:14.783,"I, um..."
00:17:18.287,00:17:19.663,I gotta go.
00:17:43.062,00:17:44.313,"Oh, my God!"
00:17:44.396,00:17:47.274,You sneaky little beeyotch! Who was it?
00:17:51.528,00:17:53.113,Sisters don't keep secrets.
00:17:55.616,00:17:57.659,I'm totally having déjà vu right now.
00:17:57.743,00:17:59.244,Oh! I have it all the time.
00:17:59.328,00:18:02.372,It's supposed to mean like someone's thinking about you while they're masturbating.
00:18:02.456,00:18:03.916,I have it at least five times a day.
00:18:05.334,00:18:07.961,"Seriously, I've been having it all day. It's so weird."
00:18:08.045,00:18:10.297,"Maybe you should switch to water next time, hon."
00:18:11.298,00:18:14.510,"I... Yeah, thanks. I'll keep that in mind."
00:18:14.593,00:18:15.969,What are sisters for?
00:18:16.053,00:18:18.806,"Oh, and don't forget, house meeting at lunch."
00:18:19.765,00:18:21.100,Hello?
00:18:21.183,00:18:23.393,"It's been on the board since last Thursday, Tree."
00:18:23.560,00:18:26.563,Yeah. I remember it.
00:18:31.026,00:18:32.653,She finally rolls in.
00:18:33.779,00:18:35.239,That's so weird.
00:18:37.074,00:18:38.575,You were kind of a mess last night.
00:18:41.203,00:18:43.455,"Oh, shit. I'm so late for class."
00:18:50.587,00:18:52.339,Did you really think you could keep it a secret from me?
00:18:56.426,00:18:57.636,Don't you wanna know how I found out?
00:18:57.719,00:18:58.804,Driver's license?
00:18:58.887,00:19:00.139,Clever girl.
00:19:02.432,00:19:03.809,I gotta go.
00:19:05.435,00:19:10.232,But you didn't even blow out the-- Candle.
00:19:15.904,00:19:18.282,And we still need to pick this year's charity.
00:19:18.365,00:19:22.578,"I can say right now, there's no way we are doing the Special Needs Art Fair again."
00:19:25.455,00:19:28.167,10% off with your student ID.
00:19:39.553,00:19:41.930,"Um, I'm just a little tired, I guess."
00:19:42.014,00:19:43.599,"No, dumbass."
00:19:44.183,00:19:45.225,What's wrong with that?
00:19:48.228,00:19:50.272,So not Kappa cuisine.
00:19:50.939,00:19:52.191,And is that chocolate milk I see?
00:19:52.816,00:19:53.984,I missed breakfast.
00:19:54.067,00:19:55.569,"We all miss breakfast, Becky."
00:20:02.910,00:20:05.746,"I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Tree."
00:20:05.829,00:20:07.581,"Wait, you two know each other?"
00:20:07.664,00:20:09.499,-Yeah. I mean... -No!
00:20:10.584,00:20:13.253,We had a class together last year. That's all.
00:20:15.339,00:20:17.007,I'm sorry about all this.
00:20:18.634,00:20:19.635,Hey.
00:20:23.555,00:20:25.224,-What? -My bracelet.
00:20:26.058,00:20:27.059,Oh.
00:20:30.145,00:20:32.814,"You know, I'm sorry again about the mess."
00:20:41.782,00:20:43.992,We can't do this today. There's too much going on in the building.
00:20:44.076,00:20:45.369,I need to talk to you.
00:20:51.959,00:20:54.169,-I know what you're gonna say. -You do?
00:20:55.087,00:20:56.171,Look.
00:20:56.880,00:21:03.178,"It's normal for a young girl to have feelings for an older man, but you can't fall in love."
00:21:04.096,00:21:05.889,I'm not falling in love with you.
00:21:06.848,00:21:07.849,You're not?
00:21:08.267,00:21:15.691,No. I've been having the weirdest day-- Your wife.
00:21:16.858,00:21:19.319,"Uh, that's kind of a buzzkill."
00:21:23.657,00:21:25.367,Thank God you locked the door.
00:21:32.374,00:21:34.710,"Uh, I didn't realize I'd locked the door. Um..."
00:21:34.793,00:21:37.587,"Just wrapping up here. Have you met my student, Theresa?"
00:21:38.213,00:21:39.214,No...
00:21:39.298,00:21:40.674,I haven't.
00:21:41.842,00:21:43.176,Nice to meet you.
00:22:00.319,00:22:01.403,-Where? -Right in there.
00:22:02.487,00:22:03.697,And Mom goes in for the kill.
00:22:07.367,00:22:08.952,"Hey, don't look at me."
00:22:16.585,00:22:19.212,I know! I'm just borrowing it for tonight.
00:22:19.796,00:22:21.423,What time you going to the party?
00:22:21.506,00:22:23.383,But I'm trying not to let that bring me down.
00:22:25.594,00:22:27.804,-Earth to space bitch. -What?
00:22:30.891,00:22:33.643,Uh... I don't know. Later.
00:22:36.063,00:22:37.731,Our tuition dollars at work.
00:22:39.733,00:22:40.817,"Okay, whoa!"
00:22:40.901,00:22:43.445,"Chill out. It's just another rolling blackout, sweetie."
00:22:43.779,00:22:45.781,-It happened before? -Yeah.
00:22:45.864,00:22:47.032,Like two weeks ago.
00:22:47.574,00:22:50.911,"Anyhoo, don't be too late, or all the cute Sigma boys will be taken."
00:22:57.459,00:23:06.009,I sat in that restaurant waiting for you for over an-- Babies for life!
00:23:53.598,00:23:54.724,No way.
00:24:56.286,00:24:58.205,Surprise?
00:24:58.622,00:25:00.123,"What the hell, Tree?"
00:25:00.498,00:25:05.253,"Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I thought that you-- I am so, so sorry."
00:25:05.462,00:25:07.214,Don't mess with a Kappa bitch.
00:25:22.354,00:25:23.605,-Yes. -Are you serious?
00:25:23.688,00:25:24.689,Yes.
00:25:24.773,00:25:26.691,-That slut. -Who?
00:25:26.775,00:25:29.194,Lori. She said she'd be here.
00:25:29.277,00:25:30.570,She's so out of the house next year.
00:25:30.654,00:25:32.656,"I think she said she had, like, a double shift."
00:25:32.739,00:25:35.158,Whatevs. She's been boning some mystery guy.
00:25:38.703,00:25:40.080,There's your stalker.
00:25:40.622,00:25:41.539,He's so hot.
00:25:41.623,00:25:43.333,-Danielle! -What?
00:25:43.416,00:25:45.335,"-That is so gross. -Oh, okay."
00:25:46.586,00:25:47.712,Truce?
00:25:48.630,00:25:49.714,Hi.
00:25:49.798,00:25:52.300,Why were you wearing that stupid mask anyway?
00:25:52.384,00:25:53.635,Big game's on Friday.
00:25:53.718,00:25:55.512,I just thought I'd show a little school spirit.
00:25:55.595,00:25:57.138,Never thought I'd get clocked for it.
00:26:00.392,00:26:02.310,I really am sorry. Did you ice it?
00:26:02.936,00:26:04.062,It's fine.
00:26:04.604,00:26:06.481,You can make it up to me later.
00:26:10.068,00:26:10.944,What?
00:26:11.528,00:26:12.946,Don't what me.
00:26:13.029,00:26:14.572,"You know exactly what you are doing, Tree."
00:26:15.115,00:26:16.866,"What am I doing, Danielle?"
00:26:16.950,00:26:18.076,Danielle!
00:26:48.273,00:26:49.691,Nick?
00:27:07.500,00:27:08.585,Wow.
00:27:25.852,00:27:27.729,"Oh, shit."
00:27:28.313,00:27:29.939,"Oh, shit, Nick. You scared me."
00:27:33.276,00:27:34.986,You want me to punch you in the face again?
00:27:49.334,00:27:53.546,Welcome to the pleasure-dome.
00:28:09.145,00:28:11.022,"It's a little loud, don't you think?"
00:28:49.769,00:28:52.939,Okay! I'm officially over this.
00:28:53.648,00:28:55.525,Have fun in the Sahara Tent.
00:28:56.943,00:29:00.238,"Come on. Nick, seriously! Danielle's, like, freaking out."
00:29:22.886,00:29:25.054,Help me! Help me!
00:29:27.474,00:29:28.850,You asshole!
00:29:41.988,00:29:43.114,Is everything okay?
00:29:49.537,00:29:52.457,What-- I don't know if you remember my name or not.
00:29:52.540,00:29:53.792,-You were-- -Pretty wasted.
00:29:53.875,00:29:54.959,Yeah.
00:29:58.338,00:30:00.173,-And your name is Carter? -Yeah.
00:30:00.256,00:30:01.883,And we've never met before?
00:30:01.966,00:30:03.134,"I mean, no, not until last night."
00:30:03.802,00:30:05.512,"Oh, my God. This is a nightmare."
00:30:07.096,00:30:08.181,I'm sorry.
00:30:08.264,00:30:10.266,You were the one that wanted to come home with me.
00:30:11.559,00:30:19.275,"Dude! Did you hit that fine vagine-- Nice one, dickhead."
00:30:26.407,00:30:27.492,Stop global warming?
00:30:27.992,00:30:30.495,Oh! A simple no thanks would do.
00:30:42.423,00:30:43.925,Keep going!
00:30:52.934,00:30:55.228,You okay? You haven't returned any of my texts.
00:31:12.537,00:31:13.621,"Hey, you okay?"
00:31:16.374,00:31:17.208,Tree?
00:31:24.257,00:31:26.551,"Tree, what's wrong? Say something."
00:31:28.887,00:31:29.929,Lori...
00:31:30.763,00:31:32.473,I feel like I'm losing my mind.
00:31:33.391,00:31:35.560,I don't know what's happening to me.
00:31:36.477,00:31:37.520,Okay.
00:31:38.521,00:31:40.899,Just calm down. Tell me what's going on.
00:31:43.484,00:31:48.656,"Look, I know this isn't gonna make any sense, but I have already lived through this day."
00:31:49.115,00:31:50.116,Twice.
00:31:52.994,00:31:53.828,Tree.
00:31:53.912,00:32:00.084,"No, no, no. Believe me. I know it sounds totally crazy, but this is happening to me, I swear to God."
00:32:00.168,00:32:03.171,"Tree. I'm sure it feels like you're living through-- Okay, you made me a cupcake."
00:32:04.130,00:32:05.798,"For my birthday, right?"
00:32:06.299,00:32:09.719,"You're about to give it to me, and then later on tonight there's a surprise party."
00:32:11.554,00:32:12.472,Ugh.
00:32:12.555,00:32:14.182,Who told you? Was it Becky?
00:32:14.265,00:32:16.392,"No, no. Nobody told me. That's what I mean."
00:32:16.476,00:32:19.979,Don't you see? I know what is going to happen before it happens.
00:32:20.188,00:32:21.064,Lori...
00:32:22.649,00:32:24.734,"Lori, somebody is gonna kill me tonight."
00:32:29.280,00:32:30.365,Okay.
00:32:30.448,00:32:32.909,"Okay, I get it. Who put you up to this?"
00:32:33.117,00:32:34.577,"-Was it Danielle? -No, no, no."
00:32:34.661,00:32:38.247,This isn't some stupid joke! This is actually happening to me.
00:32:38.331,00:32:40.208,"I don't know who is going to kill me, but someone is."
00:32:40.291,00:32:41.918,I just don't know who it is yet.
00:32:42.001,00:32:43.336,"Tree, you're starting to freak me out."
00:32:43.419,00:32:45.046,How do you think I feel?
00:32:46.673,00:32:48.007,"Tree, look at me."
00:32:49.509,00:32:51.094,Nobody is trying to kill you.
00:32:51.177,00:32:53.429,"-Yes, they are, Lori. -Tree, look at me!"
00:32:53.763,00:32:56.224,I know that today is hard with your mom and all.
00:32:57.850,00:32:59.352,Why don't you skip class?
00:32:59.686,00:33:02.730,Just take the day off and get some rest.
00:33:03.648,00:33:05.566,"I promise you, you'll feel better tomorrow."
00:33:06.776,00:33:07.735,Okay?
00:33:14.242,00:33:16.536,"Let's see you get in here now, asshole."
00:33:37.390,00:33:38.558,Um...
00:33:38.641,00:33:41.728,I just need some alone time.
00:33:42.103,00:33:43.896,What time are you going to the party tonight?
00:33:45.148,00:33:46.566,I don't know.
00:33:49.777,00:33:51.863,Our tuition dollars at work.
00:33:53.281,00:33:57.326,"Anyhoo, don't be too late, or all the cute Sigma boys will be taken."
00:33:57.994,00:33:59.787,Okay. See you soon.
00:34:07.962,00:34:11.883,Which is weird because I've never heard anything about it before.
00:34:11.966,00:34:14.302,But I'm trying not to let that bring me down.
00:34:14.385,00:34:16.345,Because I'm on my way to pick up Jace.
00:34:24.270,00:34:26.481,He's gonna be so excited to see you.
00:34:26.564,00:34:28.691,Where'd Lori put the freaking remote?
00:34:35.573,00:34:36.616,Hey.
00:34:42.830,00:34:43.831,I'm Barbara.
00:34:43.915,00:34:44.916,I am Crystal.
00:34:55.760,00:34:59.514,It's that great. G-48.
00:35:26.624,00:35:30.336,following a deadly shoot-out this morning that left one officer dead.
00:35:30.837,00:35:32.213,Tombs was the subject of...
00:37:11.896,00:37:15.733,"Do you go through a can of hair spray trying to get that full, volumized look?"
00:37:15.942,00:37:19.904,Then bump it up with Bumpits and get that salon-style look.
00:37:19.987,00:37:22.531,"Flat to fabulous, instantly."
00:37:22.740,00:37:24.909,Imagine being able to create today's...
00:37:55.856,00:37:56.857,What's going on?
00:38:00.152,00:38:02.029,"-Ow! -Tree, are you okay? Are you sick?"
00:38:02.238,00:38:05.533,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
00:38:06.075,00:38:07.910,"Oh, my God. Make it stop. Make it stop."
00:38:07.994,00:38:10.204,-Are you okay? -Get away from me.
00:38:10.288,00:38:11.414,All right.
00:38:47.783,00:38:48.701,Louder!
00:38:56.584,00:38:58.461,You forgot your stuff.
00:39:07.261,00:39:10.890,Will you please stop staring at me like I took a dump on your mom's head?
00:39:10.973,00:39:12.308,I'm sorry.
00:39:12.391,00:39:16.020,I'm just trying to wrap my brain around this.
00:39:17.688,00:39:19.440,How's that going for you?
00:39:19.523,00:39:23.986,"Assuming that I believe any of this is even remotely possible, there has to be a reason you're stuck in this day."
00:39:24.070,00:39:26.989,"Okay? Out of all the days of your life, what makes this day special?"
00:39:27.073,00:39:28.616,What gives this day meaning?
00:39:32.286,00:39:33.412,It's your birthday?
00:39:34.663,00:39:35.998,-Yeah. -Hello?
00:39:36.082,00:39:39.919,"So? Birthdays are just excuses to, like, eat cake and open presents and shit."
00:39:40.002,00:39:41.295,There's no real meaning behind a birthday.
00:39:41.379,00:39:42.588,"No, it's symbolic."
00:39:42.671,00:39:45.007,Okay? Whoever's killing you knows it's your birthday.
00:39:47.927,00:39:49.136,"All right, look."
00:39:50.513,00:39:55.309,Give me a list of names of everybody who knows it's your birthday and whoever is trying to kill you.
00:39:56.060,00:40:00.981,"Well, thanks to my sorority, pretty much the entire school knows it's my birthday."
00:40:01.065,00:40:03.275,"God, they're throwing me this stupid surprise party tonight."
00:40:03.359,00:40:05.528,"I mean, it literally could be anyone."
00:40:06.779,00:40:07.905,"I mean, who has motive?"
00:40:10.825,00:40:12.535,"Okay, maybe it's Danielle."
00:40:13.285,00:40:14.286,All right.
00:40:14.370,00:40:17.164,"Apparently, I made out with some guy she liked right in front of her last night."
00:40:18.749,00:40:19.625,Huh.
00:40:22.336,00:40:23.838,Must have been before we met.
00:40:24.505,00:40:25.339,Busy night?
00:40:26.632,00:40:30.970,"Okay, Mr. I'm gonna take this drunk girl home and take advantage of her. Don't judge."
00:40:31.053,00:40:34.098,"For the record, I didn't take advantage of you last night, okay?"
00:40:34.181,00:40:35.307,I slept on Ryan's bed.
00:40:37.351,00:40:40.479,"-So, we didn't have... -No!"
00:40:41.063,00:40:42.773,You were wasted last night.
00:40:42.940,00:40:46.235,"You know, I was afraid you were gonna fall or choke on your own vomit like Janis Joplin."
00:40:55.411,00:40:57.163,"Uh, what were we..."
00:40:57.246,00:40:58.664,-Suspects. -Right. Suspects.
00:40:58.747,00:41:00.708,"Um, okay, so Danielle."
00:41:03.252,00:41:06.130,"Gregory. Um, his wife."
00:41:06.338,00:41:07.506,Creepy Tim.
00:41:07.590,00:41:11.510,"Ooh! Um, that tiny girl from T.J. Maxx that I got fired."
00:41:11.594,00:41:14.305,And maybe the Uber driver that I spit on last week.
00:41:14.388,00:41:18.184,I think his name was-- What? Nobody's perfect.
00:41:20.227,00:41:21.562,Okay. This isn't helping.
00:41:23.439,00:41:25.691,"-This is pointless, isn't it? -All right, look."
00:41:26.066,00:41:30.446,The way I see it is you have unlimited amount of lives.
00:41:30.905,00:41:33.532,So you have unlimited opportunities to solve your own murder.
00:41:33.616,00:41:38.871,So I'm just supposed to keep dying until I figure out who my killer is?
00:41:39.205,00:41:41.040,That's your genius plan?
00:41:41.248,00:41:42.333,Do you have a better idea?
00:43:23.601,00:43:24.560,Asshole!
00:43:34.153,00:43:35.487,I knew it was you!
00:43:38.657,00:43:40.951,-Get off of me! -I'm gonna kill you.
00:44:29.792,00:44:31.835,"Oh, my God. Becky?"
00:44:32.961,00:44:34.213,Becky!
00:44:35.089,00:44:36.256,Becky!
00:44:36.965,00:44:38.217,Becky!
00:45:02.741,00:45:04.159,"Oh, hey, you're up."
00:45:05.035,00:45:07.079,I wasn't sure if you wanted to sleep in...
00:45:07.162,00:45:09.415,Your plan totally sucks.
00:45:09.832,00:45:10.666,What?
00:45:17.423,00:45:18.882,I don't know if you remember my name or not.
00:45:18.966,00:45:21.635,"You know, you were pretty wasted last night."
00:45:24.596,00:45:25.848,Are you okay?
00:45:26.932,00:45:28.142,Never better.
00:45:34.523,00:45:36.608,-Are you sure you're okay? -I'm fine.
00:45:37.025,00:45:40.612,Dude! Did you hit that fine vagine or-- What's up? Hey.
00:45:40.696,00:45:43.699,"Um, I'm sorry to bother you guys, uh..."
00:45:46.160,00:45:48.829,"I had to sleep in my car, so he could finally get laid."
00:45:52.416,00:45:54.376,"Carter, please, a little help. Carter!"
00:46:32.414,00:46:33.290,Tree.
00:46:34.500,00:46:36.710,"Hey, hey, hey, calm down. It's just me."
00:46:39.838,00:46:40.797,How you doing?
00:46:42.633,00:46:44.092,What happened?
00:46:44.927,00:46:47.012,You collapsed this morning.
00:46:47.095,00:46:48.096,What day is it?
00:46:48.972,00:46:50.057,It's Monday.
00:46:50.140,00:46:51.141,What's the date?
00:46:51.600,00:46:53.310,"Uh, it's the 18th."
00:46:55.270,00:46:58.982,"Oh, we've been trying to get in contact with your parents, but for some reason there's..."
00:47:03.278,00:47:04.947,-Jeez! -Can I help you?
00:47:05.030,00:47:07.074,"Uh, I'm just checking on her."
00:47:07.157,00:47:08.909,It's okay. He's a friend.
00:47:08.992,00:47:11.078,Sorry. Visiting hours are over.
00:47:11.703,00:47:12.788,Got it.
00:47:14.331,00:47:15.415,"Thanks, Carter."
00:47:17.417,00:47:18.710,Feel better.
00:47:22.089,00:47:23.257,When can I get out of here?
00:47:29.304,00:47:32.224,I'm having a hard time pulling your medical records.
00:47:34.601,00:47:35.435,Why?
00:47:36.895,00:47:38.772,We just got these back from imaging.
00:47:39.314,00:47:42.693,And these are signs of major trauma.
00:47:43.735,00:47:47.489,Given the severity of the scar tissue and the size of the lesions...
00:47:50.867,00:47:56.456,"This is gonna sound crazy but, technically, you should be dead."
00:48:01.003,00:48:03.130,"Hey. Hey, hey! What are you doing?"
00:48:03.213,00:48:04.214,I need to get out of here.
00:48:04.298,00:48:06.008,"No way. No, you need to stay here for observation."
00:48:06.091,00:48:07.843,"If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna die."
00:48:11.930,00:48:14.516,You are absolutely safe here.
00:48:19.062,00:48:20.355,Okay.
00:48:21.273,00:48:23.150,I won't let anything happen to you.
00:48:29.239,00:48:32.659,I'm really thirsty. Could you get me a soda?
00:48:33.702,00:48:34.786,Sure.
00:48:36.121,00:48:37.122,Thank you.
00:49:00.812,00:49:02.731,Special delivery.
00:49:36.431,00:49:37.933,"Keys, keys, keys."
00:49:42.187,00:49:44.439,"Oh, Greg. Where are the car keys? Come on!"
00:50:47.043,00:50:50.005,Tree. Tree. It's okay. It's okay. It's just me.
00:50:50.297,00:50:51.465,"Gregory, look out!"
00:51:18.992,00:51:21.119,"Come on. Come on, come on, come on."
00:53:16.067,00:53:17.360,I did it.
00:53:18.153,00:53:21.114,I did it! I did it!
00:53:21.281,00:53:23.074,Whoo!
00:53:23.825,00:53:25.160,Yeah!
00:53:26.161,00:53:28.330,"Catch me now, bitch!"
00:53:29.956,00:53:31.541,Whoo!
00:53:35.170,00:53:36.212,What?
00:53:37.088,00:53:40.216,"Oh, no, no, no! Come on!"
00:53:40.300,00:53:41.676,No!
00:53:41.843,00:53:43.386,"Oh, shit!"
00:53:59.152,00:54:00.946,"Shit, shit, shit."
00:54:04.157,00:54:07.327,"I know I was speeding, officer. I just-- Turn off the engine, please."
00:54:09.204,00:54:10.455,"Yes, officer."
00:54:11.039,00:54:12.540,License and registration.
00:54:13.875,00:54:15.043,"I, um..."
00:54:18.380,00:54:19.673,I don't have it.
00:54:21.633,00:54:23.426,-Pardon me? -He's trying to kill me again.
00:54:24.344,00:54:25.512,-Again? -Yes!
00:54:25.595,00:54:26.888,"I mean, no."
00:54:26.972,00:54:28.848,"He was trying before, but this time I got away."
00:54:28.932,00:54:32.352,"But I didn't have time to grab my clothes, and my driver's license is in my pocket."
00:54:35.814,00:54:39.192,"Ma'am, are you under the influence of alcohol or any other controlled substance?"
00:54:39.275,00:54:46.032,No! That is what I'm trying to-- Wait.
00:54:47.242,00:54:52.664,"If I am, does that mean that you're going to arrest me and lock me in a jail cell?"
00:54:52.747,00:54:54.416,That's how it usually works.
00:54:54.499,00:54:55.375,I'm drunk.
00:54:58.086,00:54:59.045,You are?
00:54:59.129,00:55:00.714,Wasted. And I'm high.
00:55:00.797,00:55:03.258,"You know, pills, weed. You name it, man, I'm on it."
00:55:05.385,00:55:07.303,Uh... Well...
00:55:08.430,00:55:10.849,Then I'm gonna put you under arrest.
00:55:12.892,00:55:14.310,That's a good idea.
00:55:15.937,00:55:17.564,Let me help you.
00:55:17.647,00:55:19.274,"Uh, all right."
00:55:24.320,00:55:26.114,-Never been arrested before. -Uh-huh.
00:55:31.202,00:55:32.328,Thank you.
00:55:33.538,00:55:35.707,we got a 1-8-7 at University Hospital. Suspect is...
00:55:55.602,00:55:56.519,Shit.
00:55:59.481,00:56:01.066,"Get me out, get me out!"
00:56:17.332,00:56:19.751,Why are you doing this to me?
00:56:19.959,00:56:21.419,Who are you?
00:56:21.961,00:56:23.922,"Show your face, you pussy!"
00:56:32.347,00:56:33.723,Where are you going?
00:56:59.624,00:57:01.209,"Oh, shit!"
00:57:18.601,00:57:19.936,"Oh, fuck."
00:57:33.950,00:57:35.285,"Oh, hey, you're up."
00:57:35.368,00:57:36.453,Silence!
00:57:46.838,00:57:48.047,"What, you've been here before?"
00:57:49.340,00:57:51.759,"Hey, you know, I don't think you should be taking that many."
00:57:51.843,00:57:53.970,"I mean, you could-- You could die."
00:57:54.053,00:57:55.472,If only it were that easy.
00:58:01.186,00:58:02.187,There you go.
00:58:10.945,00:58:13.031,-Dude! Did you hit that-- -Hi.
00:58:13.239,00:58:14.866,I'm the so-called fine vagine.
00:58:15.408,00:58:19.954,"And if that's the way that you refer to girls, you and your hand are going to have a very lasting relationship."
00:58:21.206,00:58:22.123,Have a nice day.
00:58:26.211,00:58:29.881,-What? -Are you-- You're always this charming in the morning?
00:58:29.964,00:58:32.091,Mmm. Just this one.
00:58:36.054,00:58:38.556,"So, were you having a bad dream or something?"
00:58:38.640,00:58:39.682,Sorry?
00:58:39.766,00:58:42.477,You were just screaming before you woke up.
00:58:46.856,00:58:47.774,Again.
00:58:48.441,00:58:49.442,What?
00:58:49.692,00:58:51.694,"Um, it's a long story."
00:58:55.532,00:58:57.242,I'm not doing anything today if you wanna...
00:58:58.743,00:59:01.996,"Seriously, I hate this sticker."
00:59:08.336,00:59:09.504,"Hey, wait."
00:59:10.004,00:59:11.589,Why are you following me?
00:59:11.673,00:59:12.924,I wanna hear your story.
00:59:13.007,00:59:17.887,"Look, no offense, but the last time I explained it to you, it got me nowhere. So..."
00:59:19.138,00:59:20.098,The last time?
00:59:20.431,00:59:21.516,Hey.
00:59:22.642,00:59:24.310,So you're having bad dreams.
00:59:24.394,00:59:27.272,I took an elective course on neurocognition and dream content.
00:59:31.150,00:59:32.527,"I might be able to help, you know?"
00:59:32.610,00:59:37.824,Can you help me stop reliving the same day over and over only to be murdered by someone I may or may not know?
00:59:38.741,00:59:39.826,"Yep, thought so."
00:59:39.909,00:59:41.411,-Stop global warming? -Mmm.
00:59:47.584,00:59:48.585,Yep.
00:59:48.835,00:59:51.170,"-And somebody kills you. -Yep, again."
00:59:54.090,00:59:56.384,"All right, come on. You're just messing with me, right?"
01:00:00.972,01:00:01.848,Car alarm.
01:00:04.684,01:00:08.229,"Now, see that pledge over there? The one in the baseball hat?"
01:00:08.521,01:00:12.191,He's going to fall right now.
01:00:13.985,01:00:15.194,Any questions?
01:00:26.080,01:00:27.999,-That's impressive. -Mmm.
01:00:28.082,01:00:29.459,That was nothing.
01:00:39.093,01:00:40.261,Did you get it all out?
01:00:40.345,01:00:42.096,Whatever. You won't remember it anyway.
01:00:46.934,01:00:48.186,It's your birthday?
01:00:53.900,01:00:55.902,It's your dad. You wanna-- You wanna get that?
01:01:01.449,01:01:03.117,I was never close with my dad.
01:01:04.160,01:01:06.245,Can't even remember the last time he called me on my birthday.
01:01:06.913,01:01:08.456,Kinda always forgets.
01:01:08.539,01:01:10.875,Yeah. I'm supposed to be with mine.
01:01:12.043,01:01:18.341,I don't know. I couldn't bear the thought of sitting through another uncomfortable celebration while we both pretend that everything is awesome.
01:01:19.217,01:01:20.468,Are you closer with your mom?
01:01:20.551,01:01:21.594,Was.
01:01:22.595,01:01:23.554,What happened?
01:01:25.848,01:01:27.100,"Oh, she..."
01:01:27.183,01:01:29.018,Yeah. Three years ago.
01:01:31.104,01:01:32.438,I'm sorry. That...
01:01:33.356,01:01:35.525,-That... That sucks. -Yeah.
01:01:36.484,01:01:38.861,"We actually shared the same birthday, though."
01:01:39.278,01:01:40.988,Seriously? That's crazy.
01:01:43.866,01:01:48.496,"Yeah, when I was a kid, I always got to skip school."
01:01:49.330,01:01:51.040,We'd go to the beach.
01:01:52.667,01:01:59.340,"My dad would buy us this, like, huge birthday cake and put just one candle on it."
01:01:59.799,01:02:01.384,We'd blow it out together.
01:02:02.802,01:02:04.262,I bet you miss her.
01:02:06.431,01:02:07.515,Yeah.
01:02:08.850,01:02:09.976,"You know, it's funny."
01:02:10.059,01:02:17.567,"You relive the same day over and over again, you kind of start to see who you really are."
01:02:20.445,01:02:24.240,"If my mom saw me now, knew who I've become..."
01:02:26.367,01:02:28.161,I don't think she'd be very proud.
01:02:28.786,01:02:30.621,-Don't say that. -It's true.
01:02:33.040,01:02:35.042,"I'm not a good person, Carter."
01:02:37.044,01:02:39.547,Maybe this is karma. Maybe I deserve it.
01:02:44.510,01:02:48.890,"Look, I don't know you all that well, but it's never too late to change."
01:02:49.265,01:02:51.058,"I mean, especially if what you're saying is true."
01:02:51.559,01:02:55.688,"Each new day, it's a chance to be somebody better."
01:02:56.314,01:02:57.899,"See, that's just it."
01:02:59.984,01:03:02.737,I don't think I have that many chances left.
01:03:05.823,01:03:08.284,I keep on getting weaker every time I come back.
01:03:10.536,01:03:13.164,Maybe I'm like that cat with nine lives.
01:03:14.332,01:03:16.542,"Eventually, I'm gonna run out."
01:03:20.505,01:03:23.633,where Jennifer Tran has the latest on this developing situation.
01:03:23.716,01:03:30.932,"I'm standing outside the Bayfield University Hospital where suspected murderer, John Tombs, is being treated for a gunshot wound..."
01:03:31.682,01:03:33.267,"Can you turn that up, please?"
01:03:33.351,01:03:34.936,...that left one officer dead.
01:03:35.228,01:03:42.026,Tombs was the subject of a nationwide manhunt that ended after a five-month pursuit -across four state lines... -What's going on? Tree?
01:03:42.109,01:03:44.946,...that left six female victims.
01:03:45.029,01:03:48.449,Authorities are still not sure if Tombs is responsible for the murders...
01:03:48.533,01:03:49.742,"Oh, my God."
01:03:49.826,01:03:53.746,...of more than a dozen other victims he's claimed to have buried across the vast desert of Arizona.
01:03:53.830,01:03:55.248,He's been here the whole time.
01:03:58.835,01:04:01.128,Hey-- Tree!
01:04:04.382,01:04:05.883,He's going to escape. Call the police.
01:04:05.967,01:04:07.051,-Who? -John Tombs.
01:04:07.134,01:04:08.594,-Just call the police. -What?
01:04:08.678,01:04:09.720,Wait! Don't go in there!
01:04:09.804,01:04:11.055,Shit.
01:04:11.514,01:04:13.224,Excuse me. What are you doing?
01:05:10.406,01:05:12.742,"He has a gun! He has a gun, run!"
01:05:19.332,01:05:20.291,Come on.
01:05:39.602,01:05:40.436,Stop!
01:05:41.228,01:05:43.064,Stop it right now. Hey!
01:05:49.987,01:05:50.821,No.
01:06:29.402,01:06:31.862,"There's nowhere to hide, little girl!"
01:06:43.833,01:06:44.709,Carter.
01:06:47.586,01:06:50.506,"If I don't reset this day, he's gone forever."
01:07:21.662,01:07:24.373,"Come on. Olly, olly, oxen free."
01:07:34.759,01:07:36.677,"See you soon, asshole."
01:07:53.402,01:07:57.948,"Hi, I wasn't sure if you wanted-- I can't believe you tried to save my life. Thank you so much."
01:07:58.491,01:07:59.325,Yeah.
01:07:59.408,01:08:01.827,"Yeah, no biggie. I just brought you home."
01:08:04.330,01:08:06.207,"Uh, I don't know if you remember my name."
01:08:06.290,01:08:07.124,Carter.
01:08:08.667,01:08:09.752,Yeah.
01:08:09.835,01:08:11.504,-You-- I-- -Oh!
01:08:13.964,01:08:16.550,-Do you mind if I borrow this? -Uh...
01:08:17.218,01:08:18.594,"Yeah, yeah. Sure."
01:08:18.677,01:08:19.845,See you at lunch.
01:08:22.139,01:08:23.682,Dude! Did you hit that fine vagine or what?
01:08:27.436,01:08:28.437,Fine vagine out!
01:08:30.439,01:08:31.690,What just happened?
01:08:44.870,01:08:46.038,Hey! Stop global warming?
01:08:46.122,01:08:47.164,Sure.
01:08:48.541,01:08:50.334,"You save that planet, girl."
01:08:53.963,01:08:56.006,Yo! Sprinklers about to go on.
01:08:59.218,01:09:00.678,You're welcome.
01:09:07.226,01:09:08.310,I can't hear you!
01:09:22.449,01:09:25.411,"Oh, Tim. I know you're back there."
01:09:25.744,01:09:26.662,"Hi, Tim."
01:09:26.912,01:09:28.205,-Hey. -Hi.
01:09:28.455,01:09:30.791,"Uh, you haven't returned any of my texts."
01:09:30.875,01:09:34.128,"Look, Tim. Let's get real. I know you don't like girls."
01:09:34.879,01:09:37.256,Stop trying to be someone you're not.
01:09:37.756,01:09:40.301,"Love is love, right?"
01:09:41.719,01:09:44.889,Now you go out there and get yourself a fine piece of man ass.
01:10:01.322,01:10:02.406,Good morning.
01:10:07.870,01:10:09.121,"Oh, my God!"
01:10:09.205,01:10:10.164,You sneaky little beeyotch!
01:10:10.247,01:10:11.624,His name's Carter.
01:10:12.041,01:10:13.500,"No, we did not have sex."
01:10:13.584,01:10:15.878,But if I finally make it through this day somehow...
01:10:15.961,01:10:17.338,I'm gonna have his babies.
01:10:17.421,01:10:18.964,"Lots to do, got to go."
01:10:21.884,01:10:23.135,She finally rolls in.
01:10:31.560,01:10:33.354,What's wrong? Ugh.
01:10:36.690,01:10:38.150,"Look, Lori..."
01:10:38.776,01:10:41.237,I have been the worst roommate.
01:10:43.364,01:10:47.159,"You've always been there for me, but I've been way too selfish to even appreciate it."
01:10:48.661,01:10:49.870,Can we start over?
01:10:50.871,01:10:52.539,I promise not to be such a loser.
01:10:55.459,01:10:56.335,Are you high?
01:10:57.670,01:10:58.796,On life.
01:11:01.590,01:11:04.677,"Oh! By the way, I wanna hear about this mystery guy."
01:11:06.971,01:11:13.519,When extreme agitation occurs locomotive response in the subject shows an acceleration across-- Dr. Butler.
01:11:14.812,01:11:16.313,"Can I have a word, please?"
01:11:24.321,01:11:27.700,What the hell do-- What the hell do you think you're doing?
01:11:27.783,01:11:29.034,I'm ending this.
01:11:31.829,01:11:32.871,Wait. What?
01:11:34.498,01:11:36.333,I never should have started seeing you.
01:11:37.084,01:11:38.043,It was wrong.
01:11:38.294,01:11:46.510,"And I-- Anyway, I can't change what I've done, but I can start trying to be a better person today."
01:11:50.222,01:11:52.349,What lame little self-help book did you get that from?
01:11:54.852,01:11:58.063,You know what? You have a wife who loves you so much.
01:11:59.356,01:12:02.526,"So if you can't be faithful to her, at least have the balls to leave."
01:12:05.696,01:12:08.407,Don't expect me to let you coast by my class now.
01:12:08.782,01:12:10.326,Already dropped it.
01:12:16.290,01:12:25.632,I just have to say how totally sad and disappointing it is when certain people can't be bothered to make it to a mandatory house meeting.
01:12:26.300,01:12:28.510,We were supposed to be picking this year's charity.
01:12:30.846,01:12:34.016,"Becky, is that chocolate milk I see?"
01:12:42.483,01:12:44.651,"Oh, my God. That is so good."
01:12:44.735,01:12:47.029,What's up with the fat fest? We're Kappas.
01:12:47.112,01:12:50.282,"Come on, hon. Live a little. Few calories won't kill ya."
01:12:51.408,01:12:52.451,No.
01:12:53.118,01:12:54.870,It'll just turn me into a chunker.
01:12:55.662,01:12:56.872,Like Becky here.
01:13:01.168,01:13:02.252,Just wait.
01:13:21.980,01:13:23.315,"Oh, my God."
01:13:27.444,01:13:29.446,"Hey, Tree. Hey."
01:13:29.947,01:13:32.116,"Just, uh, coming by to..."
01:13:39.957,01:13:41.500,What was that for?
01:13:42.167,01:13:44.920,"I have to run, but what are you doing later tonight?"
01:13:45.712,01:13:46.547,Nothing.
01:13:46.630,01:13:48.132,Do you wanna take me out for my birthday?
01:13:49.174,01:13:50.384,What's the punch line?
01:13:50.467,01:13:54.513,"Look, I know it's really random, but I promise I'll explain everything tomorrow."
01:13:54.596,01:13:55.931,Assuming there is one.
01:13:56.306,01:13:57.391,Just say yes.
01:13:58.642,01:14:01.186,All right. Yeah. Yeah.
01:14:03.439,01:14:04.273,Great.
01:14:20.664,01:14:21.790,Excuse me.
01:14:23.959,01:14:25.461,"Can I pay for my coffee, please?"
01:14:25.544,01:14:28.130,"-You're not gonna eat? -No, just the check. Please."
01:14:28.213,01:14:29.506,I'll be right back.
01:14:39.683,01:14:41.643,"Hi, Daddy. Sorry I'm late."
01:14:44.813,01:14:45.898,I like your tie.
01:14:48.817,01:14:49.818,Thanks.
01:14:50.444,01:14:51.695,How's school?
01:14:52.779,01:14:53.906,Fine.
01:14:54.239,01:14:55.199,You like your classes?
01:14:57.743,01:14:59.453,I don't wanna do that anymore.
01:14:59.870,01:15:00.746,Do what?
01:15:02.372,01:15:03.499,Small talk.
01:15:04.416,01:15:07.794,It's just that this day...
01:15:09.254,01:15:11.340,This day is really hard for me.
01:15:13.133,01:15:14.301,"And, um..."
01:15:17.888,01:15:19.264,I miss Mom.
01:15:20.390,01:15:22.017,"You know, I miss her so much."
01:15:22.100,01:15:24.353,I miss the way that she smells.
01:15:31.818,01:15:33.445,"Yeah. Me, too."
01:15:34.279,01:15:35.364,I...
01:15:36.448,01:15:47.292,"I guess I thought that if I avoided all of it, if I avoided you, that somehow it would be easier, but it's not."
01:15:49.711,01:15:51.672,It's been so much worse.
01:15:54.550,01:15:58.136,All of this running and hiding has made me so miserable.
01:16:00.389,01:16:02.599,And I think I finally figured it out.
01:16:04.059,01:16:10.857,"I mean, it took something totally crazy, but I'm here."
01:16:11.817,01:16:13.068,And I love you.
01:16:13.485,01:16:17.447,"And I am so, so sorry that I hurt you."
01:17:08.832,01:17:11.293,"I need you to stand up, slowly."
01:17:15.339,01:17:16.673,Slowly.
01:17:17.633,01:17:19.092,"Okay, good."
01:17:23.138,01:17:25.599,"Okay, this is a really bad idea."
01:17:25.849,01:17:27.684,So is dying for the 16th time.
01:17:28.894,01:17:29.978,Okay.
01:17:30.646,01:17:32.064,"Now, turn around."
01:17:35.275,01:17:36.610,I need you to listen to me.
01:17:37.069,01:17:38.278,He's going to escape.
01:17:38.362,01:17:40.572,We can talk about this. Just put the gun down.
01:17:40.656,01:17:43.033,He's going to escape. Go get help.
01:17:43.116,01:17:44.868,-Go! -Okay.
01:18:29.830,01:18:31.498,I know you're not asleep.
01:18:31.998,01:18:33.375,Open your eyes.
01:18:40.632,01:18:42.134,"Safety's on, little girl."
01:18:52.602,01:18:53.603,Hmm?
01:18:58.024,01:18:59.359,You know...
01:18:59.443,01:19:02.487,"A real nice surprise, you coming to visit me like this."
01:19:14.249,01:19:15.584,I like you.
01:19:16.960,01:19:18.253,Damn shame.
01:19:20.505,01:19:22.424,"But you're a feisty little shit, ain't you?"
01:19:26.094,01:19:28.472,"That's right. Crawl, little girl, crawl."
01:19:31.850,01:19:35.187,"I'll just make this one real quick for you, okay?"
01:19:48.700,01:19:49.743,Hey!
01:19:50.702,01:19:51.828,Safety's off.
01:19:52.078,01:19:53.538,Thanks for the tip.
01:20:13.975,01:20:17.103,"So this has got to be, like, the strangest birthday you've ever had, huh?"
01:20:17.479,01:20:18.980,You have no idea.
01:20:21.024,01:20:23.193,Did you ever figure out how Tombs got free?
01:20:24.194,01:20:25.946,No. No one knows.
01:20:26.863,01:20:28.114,It's kinda like Houdini.
01:20:28.198,01:20:30.367,Yeah. I guess.
01:20:41.753,01:20:43.171,What are you gonna wish for?
01:20:47.384,01:20:49.344,-Tomorrow. -Tomorrow?
01:20:51.221,01:20:52.472,But isn't that kind of a given?
01:20:54.266,01:20:55.725,Wanna aim for anything higher?
01:20:57.394,01:20:58.395,No.
01:20:59.396,01:21:01.231,Tomorrow is good enough for me.
01:21:29.968,01:21:30.969,"Oh. Hey, you're up."
01:21:32.095,01:21:33.179,Carter?
01:21:33.263,01:21:36.308,Yeah. I'm surprised you remember my name. You were pretty wasted last night.
01:21:36.391,01:21:38.560,This can't be happening. This can't be happening.
01:21:38.643,01:21:40.729,-What? -I killed him!
01:21:40.812,01:21:42.314,I solved it!
01:21:42.397,01:21:44.232,Who? What are you talking about?
01:21:46.026,01:21:47.277,What's going on?
01:21:49.070,01:21:51.323,"I mean, look, you were probably just having a bad dream or something."
01:21:51.406,01:21:59.372,"Like that happens to me all the time when I'm drinking, you know, I-- Nice one. Dickhead."
01:22:09.132,01:22:10.717,As far away as possible.
01:22:10.800,01:22:11.843,"Tree, what's wrong?"
01:22:12.135,01:22:14.262,Me. I was wrong.
01:22:14.346,01:22:16.681,I thought that if I stopped running that I could beat it.
01:22:16.765,01:22:18.099,But it's never gonna stop.
01:22:18.183,01:22:19.559,"Tree, you're freaking me out."
01:22:19.643,01:22:21.937,"Oh well, that's me, a freak."
01:22:30.987,01:22:32.072,Tree.
01:22:33.156,01:22:34.407,"Tree, look."
01:22:36.701,01:22:37.869,Happy birthday.
01:22:38.954,01:22:41.289,"Thanks, but I already ate it last night."
01:22:48.129,01:22:49.714,"Oh, my God."
01:22:51.508,01:22:53.468,I died in my sleep.
01:22:59.808,01:23:01.434,You killed me.
01:23:03.603,01:23:04.437,What?
01:23:06.648,01:23:08.358,You poisoned it.
01:23:10.235,01:23:12.195,But I never ate it before.
01:23:18.827,01:23:21.037,So you had to find another way.
01:23:22.122,01:23:24.249,Then Tombs fell right into your lap.
01:23:26.876,01:23:28.878,The perfect scapegoat.
01:23:32.424,01:23:33.883,You had access to him.
01:23:35.969,01:23:37.345,Did you drug him first?
01:23:44.936,01:23:48.023,You knew that if he escaped everyone would assume that he killed me.
01:23:51.151,01:23:53.236,But it was always you.
01:23:59.784,01:24:02.328,You think I would actually try to poison you with a freaking cupcake?
01:24:05.331,01:24:06.499,"Okay, then."
01:24:07.584,01:24:08.668,Prove it.
01:24:14.090,01:24:15.383,"Go on, Lori."
01:24:16.843,01:24:18.094,Take a bite.
01:24:21.347,01:24:22.515,"Go on, Lori."
01:24:27.312,01:24:29.898,"Okay, then... I'll take it down to the police."
01:24:30.106,01:24:33.443,I'm sure they can tell us what your little birthday treat is made of.
01:24:41.993,01:24:44.287,You stupid little whore.
01:24:44.370,01:24:47.874,"I know I've been a bad roommate, but isn't this a bit much?"
01:24:47.957,01:24:48.958,What the hell?
01:24:49.042,01:24:52.921,"Oh, I don't know, maybe because you wouldn't stop sleeping with him."
01:24:53.463,01:24:54.631,But...
01:24:55.507,01:24:56.508,Gregory?
01:24:58.760,01:25:01.638,But he just kept choosing you over me.
01:25:03.348,01:25:05.767,Guess all he wanted was a cheap slut like you.
01:25:06.684,01:25:07.685,Wait.
01:25:07.769,01:25:11.106,You've been killing me over some stupid guy?
01:25:13.775,01:25:16.194,"You're a dumb bitch, too!"
01:25:17.612,01:25:19.155,But what I really wanna know is...
01:25:24.244,01:25:26.037,Because you've killed me before.
01:25:29.999,01:25:32.293,Then I guess I'm just gonna have to do it again.
01:25:56.025,01:25:57.694,Stop! Bitch!
01:26:01.573,01:26:02.949,What the hell's going on in there?
01:26:03.825,01:26:06.661,Nothing. Tree just fell. Everything's fine.
01:26:06.744,01:26:09.956,"Whatever, clumsy hoes. I better see you at the meeting today."
01:26:10.373,01:26:11.708,We'll be there.
01:26:14.711,01:26:16.129,"Eat it, bitch!"
01:26:57.253,01:27:03.051,Lori ate my cupcake.
01:27:16.397,01:27:22.070,"She never wore makeup, never posted any cute selfies and she literally owned a pair of Crocs."
01:27:22.153,01:27:27.408,All the signs of a psycho killer with-- Hello! I'm trying to get interviewed here.
01:27:29.035,01:27:31.371,"Oh, my God. She is such a tool."
01:27:31.454,01:27:32.497,Anyhoo...
01:27:32.747,01:27:36.709,"Lori's little plot was super lame. Poisoning a cupcake, really?"
01:27:36.793,01:27:37.961,We're Kappas.
01:27:38.044,01:27:39.671,We don't eat cupcakes.
01:27:45.468,01:27:47.553,"-Are you hurt? -Dad, no. Dad, I'm fine."
01:27:47.887,01:27:49.222,I promise.
01:27:49.681,01:27:50.932,-You sure? -Yeah.
01:27:53.268,01:27:55.561,-All right. -Okay. I'll see you soon.
01:27:55.645,01:27:57.730,"-I love you. -I love you, too. Bye."
01:27:59.190,01:28:06.197,"So now that your bedroom is officially a crime scene and all, where do you plan on crashing tonight?"
01:28:10.785,01:28:12.870,You sure you want to wake up in a dorm room again?
01:28:14.289,01:28:15.915,Only if it's yours.
01:28:18.293,01:28:20.586,"I mean, of course you'll have to sleep in Ryan's bed."
01:28:20.670,01:28:22.255,-Of course. -Yeah.
01:28:23.256,01:28:24.674,We can... Yeah.
01:28:26.926,01:28:28.177,Oh! Uh...
01:28:28.803,01:28:30.680,Almost forgot.
01:28:31.514,01:28:32.598,You left this little guy.
01:28:37.395,01:28:38.479,Thanks.
01:28:39.772,01:28:41.858,You know what your little scenario reminds me of?
01:28:41.941,01:28:43.943,What? What's that?
01:28:44.027,01:28:46.487,"Groundhog Day. The movie, Groundhog Day?"
01:28:46.988,01:28:47.947,Mm-mmm.
01:28:48.031,01:28:48.948,With Bill Murray?
01:28:49.032,01:28:50.241,Who's Bill Murray?
01:28:50.950,01:28:52.827,Are you kidding me? Ghostbusters.
01:28:53.328,01:28:56.956,Sorry. I-- -How-- -I don't know.
01:28:57.040,01:28:59.042,How do you sleep at night? You've never seen Groundhog Day?
01:29:10.887,01:29:12.388,"Oh. Hey, you're up."
01:29:14.474,01:29:18.019,"I wasn't sure if you wanted to, uh, sleep in or not."
01:29:21.689,01:29:24.150,I'm kidding. It was-- It was me.
01:29:24.567,01:29:27.111,-I just called your phone. -What?
01:29:28.029,01:29:30.073,"It's Tuesday, the 19th. You made it."
01:29:31.574,01:29:35.787,"Oh, my God. You are such a jerk!"
01:29:35.870,01:29:37.830,"-I'm gonna kill you. -Hey, that's enough."
01:29:37.914,01:29:39.707,What is wrong with you?
01:29:40.958,01:29:44.420,That was not funny. You are such a punk.
01:29:54.138,01:29:56.766,I'm not sleeping in my car again. It smells like Hot Pockets and feet.
