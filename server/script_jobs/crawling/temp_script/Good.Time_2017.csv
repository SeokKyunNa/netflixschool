00:01:22.750,00:01:25.416,&lrm;what they call sentence interpretation.
00:01:25.583,00:01:27.041,&lrm;Do you understand that?
00:01:28.875,00:01:32.125,&lrm;You know what interpreting &lrm;a sentence means?
00:01:33.791,00:01:34.833,&lrm;No.
00:01:40.291,00:01:41.500,&lrm;-Okay. &lrm;-Okay.
00:01:41.666,00:01:46.791,"&lrm;And what these are, &lrm;these are common expressions that people &lrm;sometimes say."
00:01:46.958,00:01:53.625,"&lrm;You might hear it out on the street, &lrm;you might've seen it on TV, &lrm;uh, maybe a friend, &lrm;maybe your grandmother."
00:01:53.791,00:01:56.041,"&lrm;So, I'm going to read you &lrm;a few of those, okay?"
00:01:56.166,00:01:57.833,&lrm;-Okay. &lrm;-All right.
00:01:57.958,00:02:02.583,"&lrm;Uh, the first one is, &lrm;Don't count your chickens &lrm;before they hatch."
00:02:02.916,00:02:04.625,"&lrm;What does that mean to you, &lrm;that expression?"
00:02:04.750,00:02:07.875,&lrm;Don't count your chickens &lrm;before they hatch?
00:02:08.208,00:02:10.000,&lrm;Don't count your chickens.
00:02:11.875,00:02:13.166,&lrm;Okay.
00:02:17.125,00:02:18.666,&lrm;What are you writing down?
00:02:18.791,00:02:22.708,"&lrm;Well, the reason I'm asking you &lrm;the questions is &lrm;because I'm supposed to write..."
00:02:22.833,00:02:25.291,"&lrm;-You know, write down the answers... &lrm;-Yeah, but that's what I'm saying."
00:02:25.416,00:02:26.583,&lrm;Why are you writing that down?
00:02:26.708,00:02:28.583,"&lrm;So, in case I forget it later."
00:02:28.708,00:02:31.750,&lrm;But I don't like people talking about me &lrm;after I go places.
00:02:31.875,00:02:33.416,&lrm;I don't blame you. I'm not... &lrm;And I'm not talking about you.
00:02:33.583,00:02:35.791,&lrm;This is just for me. &lrm;These are my own notes.
00:02:36.041,00:02:37.333,&lrm;No one sees them but me.
00:02:37.500,00:02:38.375,"&lrm;I don't like it, but..."
00:02:38.500,00:02:40.166,"&lrm;All right, here's another one."
00:02:40.916,00:02:44.250,&lrm;It's the squeaky wheel &lrm;that gets the grease.
00:02:44.875,00:02:47.958,&lrm;What does that expression mean to you?
00:02:54.541,00:02:56.333,&lrm;You ever heard that before?
00:02:59.833,00:03:00.875,&lrm;Nick?
00:03:02.416,00:03:03.750,"&lrm;Okay, Nick, you know what?"
00:03:03.875,00:03:06.583,&lrm;Why don't we skip this section &lrm;and just move on to the next one?
00:03:06.708,00:03:08.250,&lrm;It's actually more fun. It's easier.
00:03:08.375,00:03:09.666,&lrm;It's called word comparisons.
00:03:09.791,00:03:17.208,"&lrm;It's two words that don't appear &lrm;to be connected, &lrm;and then you say &lrm;what you think when you hear &lrm;the two words together. Okay?"
00:03:17.333,00:03:18.208,&lrm;Okay.
00:03:18.375,00:03:22.041,&lrm;All right. First one is &lrm;cat and mouse.
00:03:23.041,00:03:25.458,&lrm;What does that make you think?
00:03:25.583,00:03:27.375,&lrm;They don't like each other.
00:03:27.958,00:03:31.416,"&lrm;That's right. They're kind of enemies &lrm;against each other, right?"
00:03:31.541,00:03:32.666,&lrm;That's what I said.
00:03:32.833,00:03:34.416,"&lrm;Okay, um..."
00:03:36.083,00:03:41.458,&lrm;How about scissors and a cooking pan?
00:03:41.958,00:03:44.125,&lrm;You can hurt yourself with both.
00:03:44.458,00:03:45.625,&lrm;Okay.
00:03:49.916,00:03:51.833,&lrm;How about salt and water?
00:03:53.541,00:03:54.791,&lrm;The beach.
00:03:54.958,00:03:55.916,&lrm;The beach.
00:03:56.083,00:03:57.666,&lrm;That's a good answer.
00:04:04.291,00:04:05.458,&lrm;Um...
00:04:05.833,00:04:10.125,"&lrm;Do you mind, could we go back &lrm;to the scissors and the cooking pan? Um..."
00:04:10.250,00:04:13.291,"&lrm;When you said you can hurt yourself, &lrm;what were you... What did you mean?"
00:04:13.458,00:04:15.958,&lrm;Do you ever think about hurting yourself?
00:04:17.958,00:04:21.458,&lrm;Why did you think of being hurt?
00:04:21.625,00:04:24.125,"&lrm;Because I touched the pan, &lrm;and I hurt my hand."
00:04:24.333,00:04:26.875,"&lrm;Oh, well, that makes perfect sense. &lrm;What happened?"
00:04:30.250,00:04:32.458,&lrm;Do you remember when it was?
00:04:38.041,00:04:40.291,&lrm;Do you not want to talk about this?
00:04:42.833,00:04:44.750,&lrm;I was sitting there and trying to eat.
00:04:44.875,00:04:48.958,"&lrm;And she started yelling at me, &lrm;and pushing me, &lrm;and just telling me I can't eat food."
00:04:49.250,00:04:50.625,&lrm;That was your grandmother &lrm;who was saying that?
00:04:50.750,00:04:51.750,"&lrm;Yeah, and then she threw stuff at me."
00:04:51.958,00:04:53.291,&lrm;-She threw things at you? &lrm;-Yeah.
00:04:53.416,00:04:55.750,"&lrm;Then I picked up the pan, &lrm;and I threw it at her."
00:04:55.875,00:04:57.541,&lrm;You threw it at your grandmother?
00:04:57.666,00:04:58.750,&lrm;I threw it at the wall.
00:04:58.875,00:05:01.375,"&lrm;Oh, you weren't trying &lrm;to hit your grandmother?"
00:05:08.416,00:05:11.000,&lrm;Did you burn yourself &lrm;when you threw the pan?
00:05:15.083,00:05:16.166,&lrm;Nick?
00:05:20.541,00:05:23.000,"&lrm;Nick, it's good &lrm;that we should talk about this."
00:05:23.125,00:05:24.708,&lrm;This is good stuff we're talking about.
00:05:27.916,00:05:29.250,"&lrm;Yes, I am. We're in the middle &lrm;of a session."
00:05:32.250,00:05:33.083,"&lrm;-An exam. &lrm;-Come on, get up!"
00:05:36.625,00:05:38.250,"&lrm;How would you like it &lrm;if I made you cry, huh?"
00:05:38.375,00:05:40.291,"&lrm;-Would you like that? &lrm;-No, I would not. But..."
00:05:41.666,00:05:43.000,&lrm;Let's go. Let's go!
00:05:43.125,00:05:44.666,&lrm;But he wrote... He has all my stuff!
00:05:45.083,00:05:46.958,&lrm;Rip that shit up then!
00:05:50.208,00:05:51.750,&lrm;-Shame on me? Shame on you. &lrm;-You're not helping.
00:05:51.875,00:05:52.791,&lrm;Shame on you!
00:05:54.250,00:05:56.416,&lrm;could you send &lrm;Mark and Matthew right away?
00:06:10.750,00:06:12.250,&lrm;Is that what you think you are?
00:06:12.833,00:06:14.041,&lrm;What?
00:06:23.958,00:06:26.791,&lrm;I'm sorry. &lrm;It's just that Grandma said that...
00:06:26.958,00:06:28.750,"&lrm;I don't wanna hear about Grandma &lrm;anymore, all right?"
00:06:28.875,00:06:30.250,"&lrm;Fuck Grandma, Nicky."
00:06:30.375,00:06:33.166,"&lrm;It's just you and me. &lrm;I'm your friend, all right?"
00:09:05.791,00:09:07.083,&lrm;What are you thinking about?
00:09:07.916,00:09:09.041,&lrm;Nothing.
00:09:55.166,00:09:56.500,&lrm;Stay calm.
00:10:02.666,00:10:05.416,"&lrm;No, no. No running."
00:10:08.541,00:10:10.541,&lrm;-The mask. &lrm;-What about it?
00:10:16.958,00:10:19.458,"&lrm;It's all finished now, &lrm;and everything's great."
00:10:19.791,00:10:21.416,&lrm;Nick! Nick!
00:10:28.083,00:10:30.041,&lrm;Start taking your shit off.
00:10:37.666,00:10:39.125,&lrm;It's not coming off.
00:10:39.666,00:10:41.333,"&lrm;Connie, help! Help! I can't breathe."
00:10:41.541,00:10:42.458,&lrm;I can't breathe.
00:10:42.583,00:10:43.625,&lrm;Remember how we did it?
00:10:43.750,00:10:44.916,&lrm;Fingers under the flap and pull up.
00:10:47.125,00:10:48.250,"&lrm;Push it up, push it up!"
00:10:51.250,00:10:52.916,&lrm;You were fucking incredible.
00:10:53.041,00:10:55.000,&lrm;You were incredible. Do you understand?
00:10:55.125,00:10:56.083,&lrm;-Yeah. &lrm;-I'm serious.
00:10:56.208,00:10:59.291,"&lrm;You think I could have done it &lrm;without you standing next to me, &lrm;being strong?"
00:10:59.416,00:11:00.291,&lrm;No.
00:11:00.416,00:11:01.416,"&lrm;You feel it, Nicks?"
00:11:01.583,00:11:03.000,&lrm;Are you feeling as good &lrm;as I'm feeling right now?
00:11:03.458,00:11:05.166,"&lrm;-Yeah, I'm cold. &lrm;-You're cold?"
00:11:05.291,00:11:06.708,"&lrm;-Yeah. &lrm;-Hey, fuck it."
00:11:06.875,00:11:08.625,"&lrm;-Let's get to Virginia, man. &lrm;-All right."
00:11:36.833,00:11:38.000,&lrm;What the fuck?
00:11:42.166,00:11:43.291,&lrm;Stay with me.
00:11:45.625,00:11:46.541,&lrm;Is he at the bank?
00:11:48.125,00:11:49.291,&lrm;I'm on the corner &lrm;where you dropped me off.
00:11:49.416,00:11:51.083,&lrm;You gotta get back here right now.
00:11:52.500,00:11:54.250,&lrm;I'm outside the Mango Rico.
00:11:54.416,00:11:56.000,"&lrm;Yes, yes, yes, yes."
00:12:00.750,00:12:02.458,&lrm;-Get in the car. &lrm;-Yeah.
00:12:11.333,00:12:12.416,&lrm;Let's go.
00:12:12.541,00:12:14.333,&lrm;Are we still going to the Port Authority?
00:12:14.458,00:12:16.583,"&lrm;Yes, nothing's changed, exact same place."
00:12:40.583,00:12:41.541,&lrm;You wanna hold it?
00:12:43.166,00:12:44.541,&lrm;Yeah. I don't care.
00:12:53.875,00:12:55.041,&lrm;What was that sound?
00:13:27.375,00:13:30.583,"&lrm;My face, my face. My face is burning."
00:13:30.750,00:13:32.083,&lrm;-My face is burning. &lrm;-Your face isn't burning.
00:13:32.250,00:13:33.500,"&lrm;-My face is burning. &lrm;-Hey, look at me, look at me."
00:13:33.625,00:13:34.833,"&lrm;-Connie, my face is burning. &lrm;-Look at me."
00:13:34.958,00:13:36.083,&lrm;Your face isn't burning. &lrm;You'll be all right.
00:13:36.250,00:13:37.416,"&lrm;Look, look, look."
00:13:37.541,00:13:38.416,&lrm;My face.
00:13:38.583,00:13:40.791,"&lrm;-My face, Connie. My... &lrm;-Just breathe."
00:13:41.833,00:13:43.958,"&lrm;-We going for a walk? &lrm;-No, no."
00:13:55.250,00:13:58.375,"&lrm;I told you you're not going to throw up, &lrm;so you're not going &lrm;to throw up, all right?"
00:14:01.958,00:14:02.875,&lrm;Count to 30.
00:14:10.333,00:14:11.708,&lrm;It's an emergency. &lrm;I gotta use the bathroom.
00:14:23.541,00:14:24.625,&lrm;Just give me five minutes.
00:14:29.208,00:14:31.958,"&lrm;Nick, what the fuck are you doing? &lrm;Get in the sink."
00:14:32.083,00:14:33.375,&lrm;Jesus Christ.
00:14:33.500,00:14:34.833,&lrm;Put your hands up.
00:14:36.458,00:14:38.416,&lrm;-Take it off. &lrm;-Yeah.
00:14:41.708,00:14:43.250,&lrm;My brother is mentally handicapped.
00:14:43.416,00:14:46.083,&lrm;A bucket of paint &lrm;fell off a construction truck &lrm;and hit him on the head.
00:14:46.250,00:14:47.250,&lrm;I'm gonna come out in one second.
00:14:47.416,00:14:48.791,"&lrm;It's an emergency, all right?"
00:14:48.958,00:14:50.125,"&lrm;Please, just give me five minutes."
00:14:50.291,00:14:52.625,"&lrm;-It burns, it burns. &lrm;-Stop, stop it."
00:14:52.791,00:14:54.583,&lrm;The pants got dye all over them. &lrm;Got to get them off.
00:14:55.708,00:14:58.208,&lrm;I don't care if you like them. &lrm;Gotta get them off right now.
00:14:58.375,00:15:00.416,&lrm;You got sweatpants underneath. &lrm;That's why you wore them.
00:15:01.500,00:15:04.000,&lrm;Hurry up. Lace them up. &lrm;Look for anything...
00:15:39.333,00:15:40.958,&lrm;Just keep your head down.
00:15:51.000,00:15:52.208,"&lrm;Just don't say anything, all right?"
00:15:52.333,00:15:53.541,&lrm;-Okay. &lrm;-Don't look at them.
00:15:53.666,00:15:54.750,&lrm;Don't be scared.
00:15:54.875,00:15:56.958,&lrm;-All right. &lrm;-Let me do all the talking.
00:16:01.166,00:16:02.250,"&lrm;Hey fellas, where we going?"
00:16:02.375,00:16:03.958,&lrm;Can I talk to you for a minute?
00:16:04.083,00:16:05.458,"&lrm;First of all, could you take &lrm;your hoodie off for me?"
00:16:05.625,00:16:06.750,&lrm;Why? What did we do wrong?
00:16:06.875,00:16:08.833,&lrm;Hey. You with the black sweatshirt.
00:16:08.958,00:16:10.541,"&lrm;Yo, my man, turn around!"
00:16:10.666,00:16:11.625,&lrm;He's all right. &lrm;We didn't do anything wrong.
00:16:29.208,00:16:30.375,"&lrm;Nick, let's go!"
00:16:54.583,00:16:55.541,&lrm;Nick!
00:17:03.625,00:17:04.541,&lrm;Connie!
00:17:07.083,00:17:08.208,&lrm;You're under...
00:17:22.666,00:17:24.375,"&lrm;Sir, I need you to get up!"
00:17:28.333,00:17:31.000,&lrm;Thanks for the welcome.
00:17:52.833,00:17:54.500,"&lrm;Let me talk to the fucking captain, man."
00:17:54.625,00:17:55.833,&lrm;I've been here for four days!
00:17:55.958,00:17:58.708,&lrm;-Get off the bars! &lrm;-Fuck!
00:18:05.208,00:18:06.625,&lrm;Stop fighting!
00:18:07.875,00:18:09.208,&lrm;Stop fighting! Get the captain.
00:18:12.000,00:18:13.083,&lrm;Stop fighting.
00:18:13.208,00:18:16.458,&lrm;Stop fighting or chemical weapons &lrm;will be utilized.
00:18:20.000,00:18:21.333,&lrm;Stop fighting.
00:18:42.625,00:18:44.583,&lrm;The judge is gonna ask her about Connie.
00:18:44.750,00:18:47.125,"&lrm;And if she says to the judge, &lrm;I can't talk about that."
00:18:47.291,00:18:49.333,"&lrm;He's gonna say, Then go away, &lrm;I'm not going to help Nick."
00:18:49.458,00:18:53.208,"&lrm;She needs to keep the judge happy, &lrm;answer his questions."
00:18:53.375,00:18:56.416,&lrm;She can't do that unless you answer &lrm;her questions first.
00:18:56.541,00:18:57.958,&lrm;I don't like to. I don't want to.
00:18:58.083,00:18:59.583,"&lrm;The point is, it doesn't matter &lrm;what you tell me."
00:18:59.750,00:19:01.041,&lrm;It doesn't matter what you say.
00:19:01.208,00:19:02.875,&lrm;It doesn't matter what we do &lrm;in this time together.
00:19:03.041,00:19:05.791,&lrm;Nothing that you and I &lrm;do here is going to get &lrm;your brother in trouble.
00:19:05.916,00:19:07.000,&lrm;Then why do you keep asking about him?
00:19:07.125,00:19:12.958,"&lrm;Because, you know what? &lrm;The thing is that I don't think &lrm;you're as responsible &lrm;for this as you believe that you are."
00:19:37.041,00:19:38.375,&lrm;That money was for us.
00:19:38.500,00:19:41.875,"&lrm;And he was going to buy me a farm, &lrm;and we were gonna live in the woods."
00:19:42.000,00:19:45.083,"&lrm;And I was going to be able &lrm;to do whatever I wanted, &lrm;when I wanted, okay?"
00:19:45.208,00:19:46.500,"&lrm;You don't love me, okay?"
00:19:46.625,00:19:47.500,&lrm;He loves me. Connie loves me!
00:19:47.625,00:19:48.958,"&lrm;Talking all day &lrm;on the phone over here, man."
00:19:50.875,00:19:52.625,&lrm;I don't want to talk to you no more! Okay?
00:19:52.750,00:19:53.583,&lrm;That was for us.
00:19:53.708,00:19:55.291,"&lrm;-Hey, yo... &lrm;-He did it for us."
00:19:55.458,00:19:57.166,"&lrm;I'm talking to my grandmother, okay?"
00:20:17.375,00:20:20.541,"&lrm;16,480. You need another ten grand."
00:20:20.875,00:20:22.208,&lrm;You can't do anything with this?
00:20:22.333,00:20:23.875,&lrm;This stuff is dirty. It's nasty.
00:20:24.000,00:20:25.291,&lrm;You can't clean it? &lrm;You can't do nothing with it?
00:20:25.416,00:20:27.000,"&lrm;Nah, nah. It's all garbage."
00:20:27.541,00:20:30.916,"&lrm;You get another ten grand, &lrm;I'll get the judge to sign the order."
00:20:31.041,00:20:32.958,&lrm;And that's it. I'll have the order &lrm;waiting for you.
00:20:33.083,00:20:34.500,&lrm;Your brother will get out.
00:20:35.333,00:20:36.625,&lrm;Go get the ten grand.
00:20:50.791,00:20:52.166,&lrm;What the fuck are you doing?
00:20:52.291,00:20:53.750,&lrm;I was watching this channel. &lrm;You can't do that.
00:20:53.875,00:20:55.000,&lrm;I was watching something in it before.
00:20:55.125,00:20:56.708,"&lrm;You do not rock on this TV, man."
00:20:57.166,00:20:58.291,"&lrm;Hey, yo, man."
00:20:58.416,00:21:00.458,"&lrm;If I was you, I wouldn't fuck with the TV."
00:21:00.625,00:21:01.458,&lrm;Just leave it alone.
00:21:01.583,00:21:03.625,"&lrm;Don't talk to me, all right. &lrm;I don't like you, all right?"
00:21:03.750,00:21:05.083,&lrm;-Don't talk to me. &lrm;-You got that green...
00:21:06.666,00:21:08.375,&lrm;I'm allowed to watch whatever I want.
00:21:08.500,00:21:09.583,"&lrm;Yo, my man. Don't touch that TV!"
00:21:10.125,00:21:11.208,"&lrm;Man, this is some..."
00:21:12.833,00:21:14.291,"&lrm;What the fuck is you doing, man?"
00:21:17.500,00:21:19.208,"&lrm;Are you not entertained, huh?"
00:21:19.333,00:21:20.416,&lrm;Not entertained?
00:21:20.541,00:21:23.875,"&lrm;I told you I was gonna get you, &lrm;you bitch motherfucker!"
00:22:14.291,00:22:16.166,&lrm;-Who is it? &lrm;-It's Connie.
00:22:17.875,00:22:19.750,"&lrm;No, no, no, no."
00:22:26.958,00:22:28.708,&lrm;The doorman recognized me.
00:22:31.541,00:22:33.375,"&lrm;Well, I can just come back later, Loren."
00:22:35.166,00:22:36.083,&lrm;Hey.
00:22:37.666,00:22:39.666,&lrm;And I think if you could just...
00:22:39.791,00:22:40.708,&lrm;I... I can leave.
00:23:01.875,00:23:04.416,&lrm;Just look at yourself. &lrm;This morning you were fine.
00:23:07.083,00:23:08.375,&lrm;This is your problem.
00:23:15.541,00:23:17.958,"&lrm;Mom, I want to stop this conversation."
00:23:21.666,00:23:22.833,&lrm;And I'm gonna go visit with my friend.
00:23:32.375,00:23:35.250,"&lrm;They have the best, best hotels. &lrm;I love it there."
00:23:35.375,00:23:37.375,&lrm;There's a Grand Miramar resort and spa.
00:23:37.500,00:23:38.708,&lrm;You can drink right in the pool.
00:23:38.833,00:23:40.375,&lrm;It's like they have a whole bar.
00:23:40.750,00:23:43.458,"&lrm;Ah, fuck. The flight's too long."
00:23:43.625,00:23:45.041,&lrm;It's like eight hours.
00:23:45.333,00:23:46.541,"&lrm;Okay, that's all right."
00:23:47.375,00:23:49.000,&lrm;What about Florida?
00:23:49.333,00:23:50.500,"&lrm;Or hey, hey, hey."
00:23:50.625,00:23:51.916,&lrm;Can you just put it down for a second?
00:23:52.041,00:23:53.041,&lrm;Costa Rica.
00:23:53.166,00:23:54.000,&lrm;Just put it down for a second.
00:23:54.166,00:23:56.083,&lrm;I gotta come clean &lrm;with you about something.
00:23:56.250,00:23:57.250,&lrm;What?
00:23:59.375,00:24:01.500,"&lrm;-So, I told you about my brother, yeah? &lrm;-Yeah."
00:24:04.083,00:24:05.833,&lrm;he's forced to attend &lrm;and how he shouldn't be there.
00:24:06.916,00:24:10.458,"&lrm;And how everybody involved &lrm;with it doesn't know &lrm;what the fuck they're doing, &lrm;and he fucking hates it."
00:24:10.625,00:24:12.250,"&lrm;Hey, Costa Rica's &lrm;only four and a half hours..."
00:24:12.416,00:24:14.208,"&lrm;Please, could you just put it down &lrm;for two seconds."
00:24:14.375,00:24:16.125,&lrm;Just listen to what I'm saying.
00:24:19.958,00:24:25.000,"&lrm;Look, &lrm;something happened, &lrm;I don't know exactly what."
00:24:25.125,00:24:30.291,"&lrm;But one of the therapists was abusing him, &lrm;and I guess he must have &lrm;lashed out violently, &lrm;and he really hurt the guy."
00:24:35.208,00:24:37.541,&lrm;My brother's been arrested. &lrm;He's being held at Riker's Island.
00:24:37.666,00:24:39.583,"&lrm;Oh, my God, that's awful."
00:24:39.708,00:24:40.750,&lrm;I know.
00:24:41.833,00:24:43.333,&lrm;You have no idea.
00:24:43.666,00:24:47.541,&lrm;I've just gotta get him out of there &lrm;before something bad happens.
00:24:48.458,00:24:49.666,"&lrm;See, he could get killed in there."
00:24:53.666,00:24:56.250,&lrm;I'm just a little short &lrm;on the bail money right now.
00:24:56.583,00:24:57.708,&lrm;How short?
00:24:58.625,00:25:00.916,&lrm;It's like a few thousand.
00:25:01.041,00:25:02.666,&lrm;Okay. That's not bad.
00:25:03.333,00:25:06.791,&lrm;That's why I was just hoping &lrm;your mom's credit card &lrm;could cover the rest of it.
00:25:08.916,00:25:10.875,&lrm;Oh. Um...
00:25:12.750,00:25:14.250,"&lrm;Look, it's just to get him out of Riker's."
00:25:14.416,00:25:16.041,&lrm;It's like a temporary loan.
00:25:16.208,00:25:17.791,&lrm;You get it right back.
00:25:19.291,00:25:21.875,&lrm;Any judge is gonna dismiss this &lrm;as soon as he gets to court.
00:25:22.625,00:25:23.958,&lrm;Yeah.
00:25:25.041,00:25:26.083,&lrm;Okay?
00:25:26.291,00:25:27.875,"&lrm;What, and our trip?"
00:25:28.375,00:25:29.250,&lrm;We'll go after?
00:25:30.833,00:25:34.041,"&lrm;Seriously, that's your response &lrm;to what I just told you?"
00:25:35.125,00:25:36.500,&lrm;That's your response?
00:25:36.833,00:25:40.708,"&lrm;Um, I mean, I'm thinking &lrm;about your brother, too."
00:25:42.541,00:25:43.791,&lrm;We gotta make a different stop.
00:25:43.916,00:25:45.875,"&lrm;It's still Queens. It's, uh..."
00:25:46.083,00:25:48.875,&lrm;82nd and Queens Boulevard.
00:25:49.166,00:25:50.500,&lrm;It's near the Union Turnpike.
00:25:53.458,00:25:54.458,&lrm;What'd I tell ya?
00:25:54.583,00:25:56.000,"&lrm;Couple of hours, right?"
00:25:56.166,00:25:57.416,&lrm;Yeah. You got the full ten?
00:25:58.208,00:25:59.250,"&lrm;10,000?"
00:25:59.416,00:26:01.708,"&lrm;-10,000 dollars. &lrm;-Yeah."
00:26:01.833,00:26:04.083,"&lrm;-You do credit, right? &lrm;-Yeah. Yeah."
00:26:04.208,00:26:06.000,"&lrm;Wait. 10,000 dollars?"
00:26:07.375,00:26:08.208,&lrm;Yeah.
00:26:08.333,00:26:10.125,&lrm;You said it was like &lrm;a couple thousand dollars.
00:26:10.375,00:26:12.583,&lrm;It's a loan. You get it back &lrm;the same time as the three.
00:26:12.708,00:26:13.666,&lrm;What's the difference?
00:26:13.791,00:26:16.125,"&lrm;It's like 7,000 dollars difference, &lrm;you know."
00:26:16.250,00:26:19.166,&lrm;It's for my brother. &lrm;You're gonna get it back &lrm;the same day. Right? Right?
00:26:20.458,00:26:21.333,&lrm;You'll get it back.
00:26:22.500,00:26:23.416,&lrm;Are we cool?
00:26:26.000,00:26:28.458,"&lrm;-It's for my brother. &lrm;-Yeah, I know, I know."
00:26:28.583,00:26:29.583,&lrm;It's fine. It's fine.
00:26:29.708,00:26:31.541,"&lrm;Hey, can you put it through right now? &lrm;I want to get him out tonight."
00:26:34.625,00:26:36.291,&lrm;Judges go to dinner at nine.
00:26:38.125,00:26:39.083,&lrm;Can you not make a call?
00:26:39.625,00:26:40.666,&lrm;They go to dinner.
00:26:40.791,00:26:43.041,"&lrm;It's only twenty minutes to do the bond, &lrm;prepare the paperwork."
00:26:47.625,00:26:48.916,&lrm;You're being pushy.
00:26:59.916,00:27:00.875,"&lrm;Yeah, I know, I know."
00:27:01.458,00:27:04.083,&lrm;Sorry. I just have a client &lrm;that walked in.
00:27:04.833,00:27:06.250,&lrm;Wanted me to post a bond now.
00:27:08.916,00:27:11.166,"&lrm;Yeah, can you just check, please?"
00:27:13.041,00:27:15.666,&lrm;Last name N-I-K-A-S. Nikolas.
00:27:16.791,00:27:18.541,&lrm;You think the judge will wait?
00:27:20.250,00:27:21.791,"&lrm;Come on, just ask."
00:27:22.291,00:27:23.125,&lrm;We good?
00:27:23.625,00:27:24.625,&lrm;It's pretty late for this.
00:27:26.916,00:27:29.000,&lrm;I know. Those chips are such a...
00:27:29.833,00:27:31.500,&lrm;They're the bane of my existence.
00:27:31.625,00:27:32.458,&lrm;Ah...
00:27:33.166,00:27:35.291,&lrm;Hold on. He's not on...
00:27:35.416,00:27:36.583,&lrm;He's not on the calendar for tonight.
00:27:36.708,00:27:37.833,&lrm;What's the calendar?
00:27:38.791,00:27:39.916,&lrm;Where is he?
00:27:40.083,00:27:42.708,"&lrm;Do you see anything there, any notations?"
00:27:43.166,00:27:44.375,&lrm;He's at Elmhurst.
00:27:44.750,00:27:45.666,&lrm;Lovely. Elmhurst.
00:27:46.125,00:27:47.083,"&lrm;Elmhurst, the hospital?"
00:27:47.208,00:27:48.791,"&lrm;Yeah, like where sick people go."
00:27:49.333,00:27:51.208,&lrm;What's... What's wrong with him?
00:27:51.333,00:27:52.833,&lrm;They're not gonna tell ya. &lrm;It's privileged information.
00:27:52.958,00:27:53.791,&lrm;Does this mean we're not going?
00:27:57.416,00:28:00.250,"&lrm;So until he gets a medical clearance, &lrm;they're not going to put him &lrm;on the calendar."
00:28:00.375,00:28:01.666,&lrm;When's that going to be?
00:28:01.791,00:28:03.291,"&lrm;Bobby, give me a second. &lrm;Just bear with me."
00:28:04.833,00:28:05.750,&lrm;The card is declined.
00:28:09.083,00:28:10.791,&lrm;or something? 'Cause I just used it.
00:28:10.916,00:28:12.708,&lrm;What the fuck is wrong with your card?
00:28:12.833,00:28:13.750,&lrm;I have no idea.
00:28:15.208,00:28:16.041,&lrm;I do want to call them.
00:28:17.083,00:28:18.708,"&lrm;I will dial for you, and you do it."
00:28:18.833,00:28:20.416,"&lrm;Hold on, Bobby. What do you want to do?"
00:28:20.541,00:28:21.750,&lrm;Can you not call someone?
00:28:22.000,00:28:23.375,&lrm;Give me a second. &lrm;I'm going to call Corrections.
00:28:23.541,00:28:25.208,&lrm;I'll see what I can find out.
00:28:33.541,00:28:34.916,&lrm;I'm so sorry.
00:28:35.416,00:28:36.250,"&lrm;Hi, Mom."
00:28:36.666,00:28:40.208,"&lrm;Did you, um, cancel the card?"
00:28:40.625,00:28:41.583,&lrm;Did you...
00:28:42.291,00:28:43.625,&lrm;Do you want to talk to them?
00:28:43.750,00:28:45.583,"&lrm;Mom! Sorry, sorry. Mom. I'm sorry."
00:28:47.625,00:28:49.208,"&lrm;Mom, Mom, please listen to me."
00:28:52.000,00:28:53.083,&lrm;It's a bail bonds place.
00:28:53.208,00:28:54.416,&lrm;So the thing is this. The thing is...
00:28:54.541,00:28:55.416,"&lrm;-Mom, Mom, Mom. &lrm;-Hold on."
00:28:55.583,00:28:58.666,"&lrm;-We get the money back! Mom. &lrm;-I'll call you back, Bobby."
00:28:58.791,00:29:00.250,&lrm;Chaos. Hold on a second.
00:29:00.375,00:29:01.541,&lrm;Can you take that outside?
00:29:05.500,00:29:06.833,&lrm;What do you want to do?
00:29:06.958,00:29:07.791,&lrm;Look. It's a fucking disaster.
00:29:07.916,00:29:09.583,&lrm;I didn't know she was going &lrm;to be like this.
00:29:11.166,00:29:12.458,"&lrm;I understand, I understand."
00:29:12.625,00:29:15.375,"&lrm;Just let me get back &lrm;the money from earlier, &lrm;and I'll come back with the rest in full."
00:29:15.833,00:29:17.125,&lrm;The money in my safe?
00:29:17.250,00:29:19.083,"&lrm;No, that stays in the safe."
00:29:19.208,00:29:21.291,&lrm;You want to get your brother out? &lrm;You bring me the other ten grand.
00:29:21.416,00:29:22.583,&lrm;That's how it works.
00:29:22.750,00:29:23.875,"&lrm;Come on, man. &lrm;Just give me a break, please."
00:29:24.000,00:29:25.500,&lrm;I'm giving you a break.
00:29:25.875,00:29:28.333,&lrm;That money stays in the safe. That's mine.
00:29:28.458,00:29:31.208,"&lrm;You get the other ten, &lrm;I'll get your brother out."
00:29:32.916,00:29:35.750,"&lrm;Please, this isn't your fault."
00:29:35.875,00:29:38.500,&lrm;I just wanted to do &lrm;a good thing for somebody.
00:31:09.791,00:31:11.458,"&lrm;Hey, man, what's with all the cops?"
00:31:11.583,00:31:12.416,&lrm;What do you mean?
00:31:13.291,00:31:15.125,&lrm;There's cops everywhere.
00:31:15.458,00:31:17.000,&lrm;Cops outside my dad's room.
00:31:17.875,00:31:19.791,"&lrm;All right, what floor is he on?"
00:31:19.916,00:31:21.000,&lrm;Five.
00:31:21.125,00:31:22.875,&lrm;There's not supposed to be &lrm;any prisoners on five.
00:31:23.000,00:31:24.500,&lrm;They're supposed to be on six.
00:31:24.625,00:31:26.000,&lrm;Supposed to be on six?
00:31:26.166,00:31:27.666,&lrm;That's unacceptable.
00:31:41.041,00:31:42.333,&lrm;Excuse me.
00:31:42.500,00:31:43.791,&lrm;Where's the nearest bathroom?
00:31:43.916,00:31:44.916,"&lrm;Down the hall, to the left."
00:31:45.208,00:31:46.416,&lrm;Thank you.
00:32:31.083,00:32:32.208,&lrm;Hey.
00:32:32.583,00:32:34.500,"&lrm;Something just scared &lrm;the shit out of me, man."
00:32:34.625,00:32:35.458,&lrm;What?
00:32:35.583,00:32:38.083,&lrm;I was sleeping with my dad down the hall.
00:32:38.625,00:32:41.500,"&lrm;Who's dying, so I'm already &lrm;half freaked out already."
00:32:41.625,00:32:45.416,"&lrm;And, uh, all the TV channels &lrm;started changing on their own."
00:32:45.541,00:32:46.583,"&lrm;When I get up, it stops."
00:32:46.708,00:32:50.166,"&lrm;When I sit back down, &lrm;they all start changing again. So I..."
00:32:52.000,00:32:53.166,&lrm;What the fuck is that?
00:32:53.875,00:32:55.916,"&lrm;I don't know what to tell you, man."
00:32:59.416,00:33:01.750,"&lrm;Fuck, man. I'm think I'm losing my mind."
00:33:01.875,00:33:04.125,&lrm;I've been here 48 hours straight.
00:33:04.500,00:33:06.166,&lrm;Want something from the vending machine?
00:33:06.291,00:33:08.000,"&lrm;Nah, I'm good. Thank you."
00:33:31.208,00:33:32.416,&lrm;Hello?
00:34:14.625,00:34:15.958,&lrm;You want some?
00:36:44.875,00:36:46.375,"&lrm;Excuse me, ma'am."
00:36:46.833,00:36:48.250,&lrm;Do you mind if I put my brother on first?
00:36:48.416,00:36:50.916,"&lrm;It's so cold, and he doesn't have &lrm;a jacket or anything."
00:36:51.041,00:36:52.791,&lrm;-Is that all right? &lrm;-You don't mind?
00:36:52.916,00:36:53.958,&lrm;All right.
00:36:54.291,00:36:56.083,&lrm;Thank you so much. God bless you.
00:37:01.583,00:37:02.583,&lrm;All right.
00:37:02.708,00:37:04.291,&lrm;Thank you.
00:37:06.625,00:37:07.583,"&lrm;Hey, can we get on now?"
00:37:10.583,00:37:11.708,&lrm;Just go in this way.
00:37:17.291,00:37:18.375,&lrm;Okay.
00:37:20.416,00:37:21.375,&lrm;There we go.
00:37:24.291,00:37:25.416,&lrm;All right.
00:37:25.708,00:37:28.208,&lrm;Push it. There you go.
00:38:02.791,00:38:03.833,&lrm;6180 Woodhaven.
00:38:04.250,00:38:06.333,"&lrm;That's ours. &lrm;Close to the building, please."
00:38:11.000,00:38:13.458,&lrm;-Regal Garden. &lrm;-That's us. That's us.
00:38:28.791,00:38:30.416,&lrm;220 Fourth Avenue.
00:38:38.791,00:38:40.125,&lrm;Excuse me.
00:38:41.125,00:38:42.125,&lrm;-Good night. &lrm;-Thank you.
00:38:43.958,00:38:44.791,"&lrm;You, too."
00:38:45.166,00:38:46.125,"&lrm;Hope he does, too."
00:38:48.625,00:38:50.041,&lrm;Bring your feet up.
00:38:54.125,00:38:55.125,"&lrm;Hey, yo!"
00:38:55.708,00:38:58.875,&lrm;I only had three stops. &lrm;I didn't know about a fourth.
00:38:59.041,00:39:00.750,"&lrm;That's odd, man. I definitely called."
00:39:00.875,00:39:02.833,&lrm;This dispatch be messing me up.
00:39:02.958,00:39:05.416,&lrm;It's all good. &lrm;We only live a few blocks from here.
00:39:05.791,00:39:08.041,&lrm;That's why I figured &lrm;you were leaving us last.
00:39:08.333,00:39:10.041,"&lrm;A few blocks. What, like two blocks?"
00:39:10.166,00:39:14.250,&lrm;Like a literal two blocks &lrm;or a 15 minutes two blocks?
00:39:14.375,00:39:15.708,&lrm;Two blocks. It's right there.
00:39:17.458,00:39:18.708,"&lrm;All right, I got you."
00:39:18.833,00:39:20.083,&lrm;Thank you.
00:39:20.500,00:39:22.458,"&lrm;All right, say when."
00:39:22.708,00:39:24.000,&lrm;Uh...
00:39:26.000,00:39:27.958,&lrm;It's just down here on the right. &lrm;It's the one with the driveway.
00:39:28.208,00:39:30.291,"&lrm;-You don't got to pull in. &lrm;-Oh, yeah?"
00:39:30.458,00:39:31.791,&lrm;I'll just push him from here.
00:39:56.083,00:39:58.333,&lrm;Who's this? I don't know.
00:39:58.500,00:39:59.958,&lrm;Every second!
00:40:03.416,00:40:04.541,&lrm;Can I help you?
00:40:21.041,00:40:23.125,&lrm;I'm hoping you recognize me &lrm;from the Access-A-Ride.
00:40:23.291,00:40:24.291,&lrm;Yeah.
00:40:24.916,00:40:28.625,"&lrm;The driver just dropped us off &lrm;on our house on 23rd, &lrm;and I can't find my keys anywhere."
00:40:28.750,00:40:32.416,"&lrm;And my brother doesn't have &lrm;a jacket, and it's freezing."
00:40:32.541,00:40:34.375,&lrm;Is there any way I can use your phone?
00:40:34.500,00:40:35.791,"&lrm;Just for, like, two minutes?"
00:40:35.958,00:40:37.666,&lrm;That's okay. That's okay.
00:40:41.541,00:40:42.791,&lrm;It's so cold.
00:40:58.625,00:40:59.583,&lrm;All right.
00:40:59.708,00:41:01.208,&lrm;The battery no good.
00:41:01.333,00:41:03.208,"&lrm;-It's messed up, okay? &lrm;-Okay."
00:41:06.791,00:41:07.958,&lrm;Thank you.
00:41:10.333,00:41:11.166,&lrm;Uh...
00:41:14.041,00:41:15.708,"&lrm;Oh, God damn it."
00:41:15.833,00:41:23.291,"&lrm;Mom, it's Connie. Nick and I &lrm;are locked out of the house, &lrm;and I don't have my keys &lrm;or my wallet or anything."
00:41:23.458,00:41:28.625,&lrm;So we're gonna wait at &lrm;the Dunkin' Donuts until you get off work.
00:41:28.750,00:41:32.125,"&lrm;But if you get this message, &lrm;can you call me back at..."
00:41:32.416,00:41:33.750,&lrm;What's the number here?
00:41:43.333,00:41:46.166,"&lrm;So, yeah, call me back if you get this &lrm;in the next, like, five minutes."
00:41:46.291,00:41:47.208,&lrm;Okay.
00:41:51.166,00:41:54.625,"&lrm;Um, can I just leave him here &lrm;for, like, ten minutes &lrm;while I go break a window?"
00:41:54.750,00:41:55.625,&lrm;Why?
00:41:57.250,00:41:59.083,&lrm;-So I can get into my house. &lrm;-What window?
00:41:59.208,00:42:00.666,"&lrm;Uh, my window."
00:42:00.791,00:42:03.541,&lrm;-My window! Not yours. &lrm;-Why did you not call a locksmith?
00:42:03.666,00:42:05.666,&lrm;Because I don't have any money in my... &lrm;I don't have my wallet.
00:42:09.125,00:42:11.083,&lrm;Um... Could I...
00:42:11.791,00:42:14.000,&lrm;Could I borrow some clothes for him? &lrm;Because I...
00:42:14.125,00:42:16.291,&lrm;How many hours does your mother work?
00:42:16.416,00:42:19.041,"&lrm;Well, she gets off at, like, seven, &lrm;so she'll be back at, like, 7:30. But..."
00:42:19.166,00:42:20.708,"&lrm;Um, I hoping she gets my message."
00:42:20.833,00:42:25.125,"&lrm;If you want, I can give you a room, &lrm;not you, for your brother."
00:42:25.250,00:42:28.291,&lrm;You wait until your mother &lrm;-came back from work. &lrm;-Yeah?
00:42:28.500,00:42:29.500,&lrm;Yeah.
00:42:30.041,00:42:32.791,"&lrm;It's gonna be a long time, &lrm;that's, like, seven hours. &lrm;But is that okay?"
00:42:32.916,00:42:34.291,&lrm;Let me show you the room.
00:42:34.458,00:42:36.000,"&lrm;Why, thank you so much. That's..."
00:42:40.958,00:42:42.291,&lrm;Come with me.
00:42:51.958,00:42:53.958,"&lrm;But, sorry, the light doesn't work."
00:42:54.083,00:42:56.208,"&lrm;We have the TV, okay?"
00:43:04.708,00:43:06.416,&lrm;Okay. Leave him there.
00:43:06.583,00:43:07.875,&lrm;Come with me.
00:43:15.041,00:43:20.250,"&lrm;I've been sitting on the couch, &lrm;watching TV."
00:43:20.416,00:43:22.041,&lrm;The remote doesn't work. &lrm;Okay? It's no good.
00:43:22.208,00:43:24.541,"&lrm;If you want to change the channel, &lrm;you go in the box, okay?"
00:43:24.666,00:43:26.666,"&lrm;Okay, I can just sit here. &lrm;It's fine. Thank you so much."
00:43:38.625,00:43:39.791,&lrm;Listen.
00:43:40.083,00:43:41.458,&lrm;-I have work tomorrow. &lrm;-Mmm-hmm.
00:43:41.625,00:43:43.708,"&lrm;I'm going to take my medicine &lrm;to sleep, okay?"
00:43:43.833,00:43:44.916,&lrm;Mmm-hmm.
00:43:51.291,00:43:52.875,&lrm;All the time you're doing that to me.
00:43:53.000,00:43:55.750,"&lrm;When I'm talking to you, &lrm;I don't want your eye in the phone."
00:43:55.875,00:43:58.000,"&lrm;You have to watch me, eyes to eyes."
00:44:22.875,00:44:23.750,&lrm;Shit.
00:44:41.791,00:44:45.416,"&lrm;Um, I'm sorry, &lrm;I just need to look &lrm;for something really quickly."
00:44:45.541,00:44:46.625,"&lrm;Yeah, it's fine. Just don't, uh..."
00:44:46.750,00:44:48.375,&lrm;Just try not to wake him up.
00:44:57.416,00:44:59.083,&lrm;What's that in your hair?
00:45:01.833,00:45:05.458,&lrm;This? I found some hair dye &lrm;in your bathroom.
00:45:05.875,00:45:07.500,&lrm;You dyed your hair?
00:45:10.583,00:45:11.625,&lrm;Yeah.
00:45:12.958,00:45:14.750,&lrm;Just kind of a weirdo.
00:45:21.291,00:45:23.666,&lrm;-Hold on a second. &lrm;-I don't know what color &lrm;your hair is gonna turn out.
00:45:23.791,00:45:25.625,&lrm;I hope you don't mind. &lrm;I took your mom's phone in here.
00:45:25.916,00:45:29.083,"&lrm;That's not my mom. That's my grandmother, &lrm;and I don't care what you do &lrm;with that lady's phone."
00:45:29.208,00:45:30.416,&lrm;As long as you don't bring it back...
00:45:30.583,00:45:33.041,"&lrm;Sorry, this is my mother. &lrm;I just need to take this."
00:45:33.166,00:45:34.083,&lrm;Okay.
00:45:35.500,00:45:39.583,"&lrm;Hey, I said hold on &lrm;You don't understand. &lrm;Everything's falling apart."
00:45:42.625,00:45:44.458,&lrm;-I'm with Nick right now. &lrm;-What?
00:45:44.875,00:45:47.625,"&lrm;Oh, great. So you got your brother back, &lrm;and now you don't need me?"
00:45:49.791,00:45:51.333,&lrm;There's no reason to worry.
00:45:53.750,00:45:55.833,"&lrm;-I just... &lrm;-No, just hold on a second."
00:45:56.000,00:45:59.000,"&lrm;What I'm gonna need you to do, &lrm;you get a cab and you come pick us up."
00:46:00.291,00:46:03.458,&lrm;My mom spoke to the doorman &lrm;and told him to call her &lrm;if I try to leave.
00:46:03.625,00:46:05.791,&lrm;What time does the doorman switch shifts?
00:46:09.041,00:46:11.125,"&lrm;you go downstairs, &lrm;get a car and come pick us up."
00:46:12.500,00:46:13.833,&lrm;I'm sorry. I can't stay &lrm;on the phone much longer.
00:46:14.000,00:46:15.208,&lrm;It's rude. It's not my phone.
00:46:17.625,00:46:18.583,&lrm;What's the address here?
00:46:18.708,00:46:20.666,&lrm;220 Fourth Avenue.
00:46:26.875,00:46:28.666,&lrm;I just sent you the address. &lrm;Did you get it?
00:46:31.166,00:46:33.333,"&lrm;Okay, so come pick us up &lrm;as soon as you can."
00:46:33.458,00:46:35.208,&lrm;I love you. See you in a bit.
00:46:35.375,00:46:39.125,"&lrm;I thought I should let you know, &lrm;but my grandmother told me &lrm;-not to talk to you. &lrm;-Hey."
00:46:40.666,00:46:43.666,&lrm;Would you mind just talking outside?
00:46:44.041,00:46:47.500,&lrm;I really don't want to wake him up. &lrm;Let's just go outside.
00:46:56.375,00:46:57.583,&lrm;Just gonna make my brother &lrm;something to eat.
00:46:57.708,00:46:58.666,&lrm;You want something?
00:46:59.750,00:47:00.625,&lrm;Uh...
00:47:01.500,00:47:03.250,&lrm;I wouldn't do that.
00:47:08.333,00:47:10.583,&lrm;I have chicken nuggets in here actually.
00:47:10.708,00:47:12.291,"&lrm;Um, that should be good."
00:47:12.416,00:47:13.458,&lrm;Yeah.
00:47:27.041,00:47:28.500,&lrm;How old are you?
00:47:28.625,00:47:29.791,"&lrm;Um, I'm sixteen."
00:47:31.000,00:47:32.041,&lrm;Sixteen?
00:47:33.125,00:47:34.833,&lrm;You look way older than that.
00:47:35.458,00:47:36.666,&lrm;I know. I get that.
00:47:41.625,00:47:44.041,&lrm;So what's up? You just stay up all night?
00:47:46.666,00:47:51.208,"&lrm;Stay up, eat, watch movies, smoke."
00:47:51.333,00:47:52.750,&lrm;-Is that weed? &lrm;-Yeah.
00:47:56.708,00:47:58.583,&lrm;It has no effect on me. I'm immune to it.
00:48:01.166,00:48:03.625,&lrm;My boyfriend sells this shit. &lrm;For like 30 dollars.
00:48:05.083,00:48:06.541,&lrm;How old's your boyfriend?
00:48:06.666,00:48:08.750,&lrm;He's not my boyfriend. My ex.
00:48:10.500,00:48:12.125,&lrm;-He's a drug dealer? &lrm;-Yeah.
00:48:13.541,00:48:15.291,&lrm;Where does he live?
00:48:16.291,00:48:18.291,&lrm;Can't disclose that.
00:48:18.583,00:48:20.000,"&lrm;Oh, yeah? Why not?"
00:48:20.291,00:48:22.000,&lrm;'Cause it's gonna make his house hot.
00:48:22.125,00:48:23.250,&lrm;Can't do that to him.
00:48:23.375,00:48:24.375,"&lrm;What, from me?"
00:48:34.291,00:48:36.416,&lrm;that's threatening to commit suicide.
00:48:36.583,00:48:39.458,"&lrm;The reportee on this is her husband, &lrm;who's at a different location."
00:48:39.583,00:48:44.000,"&lrm;Apparently, she's armed herself &lrm;with a knife and has taken &lrm;some anti-depressant drugs."
00:48:44.166,00:48:46.833,&lrm;This is our second time &lrm;out to this apartment today.
00:48:47.000,00:48:50.666,&lrm;And it looks like &lrm;she's still out front in her car here.
00:48:50.791,00:48:51.833,&lrm;The red minivan.
00:48:55.541,00:48:56.541,&lrm;Shit.
00:48:59.416,00:49:00.875,&lrm;Sharon. Stop it!
00:49:01.958,00:49:03.875,&lrm;Did he just try to kick her?
00:49:06.583,00:49:07.958,"&lrm;-Yes, I do. &lrm;-You lied to me."
00:49:09.791,00:49:12.416,"&lrm;Come on, we need you out here. &lrm;Come on, come on."
00:49:12.541,00:49:13.833,&lrm;-Give me that knife! &lrm;-Oh!
00:49:14.375,00:49:16.458,&lrm;Back off! Lady...
00:49:17.416,00:49:18.791,&lrm;Jesus Christ.
00:49:23.541,00:49:24.750,"&lrm;-Oh, my God. &lrm;-You gotta change this."
00:49:24.875,00:49:26.875,&lrm;I don't want to see them &lrm;justify this shit.
00:49:28.875,00:49:30.583,&lrm;Just leave the knife right there.
00:49:37.666,00:49:39.666,&lrm;for dog fighting inside his home.
00:49:42.458,00:49:45.958,"&lrm;One of my cousin's friends, Tiara, &lrm;she has this dog."
00:49:46.208,00:49:47.708,&lrm;His name is Blade.
00:49:47.833,00:49:50.291,"&lrm;He's a Great Dane. Oh, my gosh!"
00:49:50.750,00:49:53.291,&lrm;I think I was a dog in a previous life.
00:49:54.083,00:49:55.250,"&lrm;In fact, I know I was."
00:49:57.083,00:49:59.000,&lrm;It's why they love me so much.
00:50:01.125,00:50:02.333,&lrm;New York 1.
00:50:03.875,00:50:06.125,&lrm;Now an update on last week's &lrm;bank robbery in Flushing.
00:50:06.250,00:50:11.291,"&lrm;Authorities are still searching &lrm;for Constantine Nikas, &lrm;suspected of carrying out the robbery &lrm;along with his brother."
00:50:11.458,00:50:20.833,&lrm;Nikolas Nikas was arrested near the scene &lrm;after crashing &lrm;through a plate-glass window &lrm;at the New World Mall. Today the brothers' &lrm;grandmother is speaking out &lrm;in an exclusive interview &lrm;with NY1's Tara Lynn Wagner.
00:50:20.958,00:50:22.958,&lrm;She joins us now from Flushing &lrm;with the details.
00:50:26.916,00:50:29.583,&lrm;describes her complicated relationship &lrm;with her grandsons.
00:50:29.750,00:50:36.000,"&lrm;She took out a restraining order &lrm;against Constantine earlier this year, &lrm;after she says he threatened &lrm;and stalked her."
00:50:36.166,00:50:40.208,&lrm;And she blames him &lrm;for an altercation with Nikolas &lrm;that left her with a broken arm.
00:50:40.583,00:50:42.625,&lrm;I don't want to call him.
00:50:42.750,00:50:44.416,&lrm;I don't want to talk with him.
00:50:44.583,00:50:45.791,"&lrm;I don't want to, uh..."
00:50:45.958,00:50:48.875,&lrm;All because he treats &lrm;his brother so badly.
00:51:15.000,00:51:16.000,&lrm;where you going?
00:51:19.041,00:51:19.958,&lrm;Fuck.
00:51:22.166,00:51:24.041,"&lrm;Yo, where the fuck am I, man? &lrm;Did you do this to my fucking face?"
00:51:24.208,00:51:25.625,&lrm;Shut the fuck up. Lower your voice.
00:51:25.750,00:51:28.291,"&lrm;No. Back the fuck up, man. &lrm;Back the fuck up."
00:51:28.458,00:51:30.166,&lrm;-Listen! Stop it! &lrm;-Get the fuck off me!
00:51:34.916,00:51:36.250,&lrm;-Shut up! &lrm;-Ow!
00:51:38.500,00:51:41.500,&lrm;-Shut up! &lrm;-My whole fucking body hurts.
00:51:48.458,00:51:49.333,&lrm;I swear to God I'll fuck you up.
00:51:50.791,00:51:52.416,&lrm;You're in an old lady's house &lrm;in Rego Park.
00:51:52.541,00:51:54.250,"&lrm;-Are you gonna stay quiet? &lrm;-How the fuck did I get here, bro?"
00:51:54.375,00:51:56.083,&lrm;-Calm down. &lrm;-Fuck. All right.
00:51:56.250,00:51:57.375,&lrm;Get off. I'm calm.
00:51:57.500,00:51:59.375,&lrm;-All right. Calm down. &lrm;-All right.
00:52:03.000,00:52:03.958,&lrm;Thank you.
00:52:04.291,00:52:06.541,"&lrm;-Yo, take these. &lrm;-What the fuck is that?"
00:52:12.000,00:52:14.541,"&lrm;Are you gonna stay calm? &lrm;Can you leave us alone, please?"
00:52:17.750,00:52:19.416,&lrm;Shut the door. Shut the door.
00:52:19.541,00:52:20.625,&lrm;Close the door!
00:52:22.083,00:52:26.000,"&lrm;I swear to God, &lrm;if you wake up the grandmother, &lrm;-I'll fuck you up! &lrm;-Yeah, yeah. I heard you, bro."
00:52:26.125,00:52:28.000,&lrm;-God damn it. &lrm;-Are you gonna stay calm?
00:52:28.125,00:52:29.958,"&lrm;Yeah, yeah, I'm calm."
00:52:30.750,00:52:31.833,&lrm;Fuck.
00:52:31.958,00:52:33.291,"&lrm;Christ, man."
00:52:44.250,00:52:47.000,&lrm;What the fuck is going on? &lrm;Why am I in handcuffs?
00:52:47.458,00:52:49.041,&lrm;You were handcuffed &lrm;to a stretcher in a hospital.
00:52:49.208,00:52:50.333,&lrm;I broke the wrong guy out.
00:52:50.500,00:52:51.791,&lrm;-That's all I know. &lrm;-Hospital?
00:52:55.208,00:52:56.625,&lrm;I don't know what to tell you. &lrm;I don't know what to tell you.
00:52:56.750,00:53:00.083,&lrm;There was a cop outside your room &lrm;and you're the wrong guy.
00:53:00.208,00:53:02.041,"&lrm;Well, what the fuck am I going to do?"
00:53:02.166,00:53:03.500,&lrm;You can do whatever the fuck &lrm;you want to do.
00:53:03.625,00:53:05.208,&lrm;What you can't do is fuck my shit up.
00:53:05.333,00:53:07.375,&lrm;Acting stupid &lrm;and getting me thrown out. Okay?
00:53:07.500,00:53:08.500,"&lrm;All right, well listen. &lrm;Get me a phone, man."
00:53:08.625,00:53:10.458,&lrm;-I gotta make some phone calls. &lrm;-I don't have a fucking phone.
00:53:59.166,00:54:00.250,&lrm;All right.
00:54:00.375,00:54:01.666,&lrm;We need to go back to the hospital.
00:54:01.833,00:54:03.083,&lrm;Is your brother okay?
00:54:03.375,00:54:05.041,&lrm;That's not my brother. &lrm;The hospital fucked up.
00:54:07.166,00:54:08.291,&lrm;I don't know who it is.
00:54:08.458,00:54:09.875,&lrm;The hospital fucked up. It's not my fault.
00:54:10.000,00:54:12.375,&lrm;Does the car &lrm;-in the driveway work? &lrm;-Yeah.
00:54:12.500,00:54:14.125,&lrm;-Do you know where the keys are? &lrm;-No.
00:54:14.291,00:54:15.125,"&lrm;Well, where could they be?"
00:54:15.250,00:54:16.458,&lrm;Can we just go and look for them quickly?
00:54:17.833,00:54:20.666,"&lrm;Hurry up, get some shit on &lrm;and go find the keys."
00:54:20.791,00:54:21.875,"&lrm;Fuck, man."
00:54:22.000,00:54:25.083,&lrm;Don't be confused. &lrm;It's just gonna make it worse for me.
00:54:31.458,00:54:32.458,&lrm;Fuck.
00:54:48.916,00:54:50.041,&lrm;I'm leaving. You gotta leave too.
00:54:50.166,00:54:51.750,&lrm;-Let's go. &lrm;-Can I get a ride?
00:54:51.875,00:54:54.291,"&lrm;-Yeah. Whatever. &lrm;-I gotta make a phone call, too, bro."
00:54:54.416,00:54:55.458,&lrm;-Please. &lrm;-Fine.
00:54:55.583,00:54:56.750,&lrm;Just don't say anything stupid &lrm;in front of her.
00:54:56.875,00:54:58.791,&lrm;-I won't say nothing stupid. &lrm;-And clean that shit off your face.
00:54:58.916,00:55:00.208,&lrm;What the fuck do you think &lrm;I'm trying to do here?
00:55:00.333,00:55:01.916,&lrm;-You're gonna scare her. &lrm;-Get me that phone!
00:55:03.708,00:55:04.666,"&lrm;Fuck, man."
00:55:32.791,00:55:33.791,"&lrm;Oh, shit!"
00:55:39.291,00:55:41.750,"&lrm;Oh, it's probably just some bullshit."
00:56:31.625,00:56:33.125,"&lrm;Hey, Ron, it's me."
00:56:33.250,00:56:35.958,"&lrm;Listen, I'll explain later. &lrm;Are you with Mom right now?"
00:56:36.083,00:56:36.958,"&lrm;All right, listen."
00:56:37.083,00:56:39.291,&lrm;Is there anybody else &lrm;in the room with you right now?
00:56:41.041,00:56:46.708,"&lrm;Listen, listen, when I get &lrm;off the phone with you, &lrm;you gotta pretend &lrm;like you just got off the phone &lrm;with one of your friends &lrm;or something, all right?"
00:56:46.833,00:56:48.666,"&lrm;All right, it's really important."
00:56:48.791,00:56:50.750,&lrm;I gotta call you back later &lrm;from a different phone.
00:56:50.875,00:56:51.958,&lrm;I'll explain everything. All right?
00:56:52.083,00:56:53.541,"&lrm;All right, I love you, bro."
00:56:53.666,00:56:54.541,&lrm;Bye.
00:56:57.958,00:57:00.541,"&lrm;Whoa, whoa. Why are we going back &lrm;to the hospital for?"
00:57:00.666,00:57:01.750,&lrm;I thought that's where you wanted to go.
00:57:01.875,00:57:03.458,&lrm;Are you fucking crazy?
00:57:18.041,00:57:19.041,&lrm;All right.
00:57:20.250,00:57:22.291,&lrm;I'm gonna drop you off &lrm;at that White Castle.
00:57:22.416,00:57:23.958,"&lrm;I gotta get something &lrm;for my brother, anyway."
00:57:41.166,00:57:43.833,"&lrm;Yo, could you run in and get a number five &lrm;six-piece chicken thing?"
00:57:48.125,00:57:50.083,"&lrm;Just a couple sliders, please."
00:57:51.833,00:57:52.958,&lrm;Go ahead.
00:57:55.083,00:57:57.458,"&lrm;-Here. &lrm;-No, no, leave that in here."
00:57:57.583,00:57:58.666,&lrm;I wanna use it.
00:58:07.208,00:58:08.125,"&lrm;All right, bro. She's gone."
00:58:08.250,00:58:09.791,&lrm;Let's get the fuck out of here! &lrm;Let's fucking book it.
00:58:09.916,00:58:12.958,&lrm;Driving around in a stolen car? &lrm;Don't be a fucking idiot.
00:58:13.083,00:58:14.583,&lrm;We're waiting for her here.
00:58:14.708,00:58:16.375,"&lrm;Well, I guess I'm gonna stay &lrm;in the car, too, then, man."
00:58:16.541,00:58:18.208,&lrm;Because you've seen how it is back there.
00:58:18.375,00:58:19.416,&lrm;All those fucking cops.
00:58:20.583,00:58:23.666,"&lrm;And there's fucking cops &lrm;at my house. &lrm;I don't think you understand, bro."
00:58:23.833,00:58:26.250,&lrm;I just got out of prison yesterday.
00:58:26.375,00:58:27.750,&lrm;I'm on fucking parole.
00:58:27.875,00:58:28.833,&lrm;I'm fucked.
00:58:28.958,00:58:30.333,&lrm;I'm gonna end up back in jail.
00:58:30.458,00:58:32.708,&lrm;I am not going back to jail!
00:58:33.000,00:58:35.833,&lrm;And these fucking pills aren't doing shit.
00:58:36.000,00:58:40.333,"&lrm;Man, this is all a bunch of fucking &lrm;bullshit, man!"
00:58:40.500,00:58:43.125,&lrm;Shut the fuck up. I'm trying to think. &lrm;Okay?
00:58:43.250,00:58:44.708,&lrm;What do you think I'm trying to do?
00:58:44.833,00:58:46.875,"&lrm;I'm trying to fucking &lrm;figure out my shit, too."
00:58:47.041,00:58:49.500,&lrm;I don't know what the fuck &lrm;I'm going to do.
00:58:49.833,00:58:52.791,&lrm;I don't remember half the shit &lrm;that went on yesterday.
00:58:52.958,00:58:55.125,&lrm;I don't know if I ended up &lrm;in the hospital first.
00:58:55.250,00:58:56.083,&lrm;Or the precinct first.
00:58:56.250,00:58:58.250,&lrm;I don't know if they got my fingerprints.
00:58:58.416,00:59:00.083,&lrm;I don't know what the fuck is going on.
00:59:00.250,00:59:04.250,&lrm;And I don't remember half of it &lrm;because I was so goddamned fucked up!
00:59:05.583,00:59:08.875,&lrm;I remember being dropped off by a bus.
00:59:09.208,00:59:13.500,"&lrm;The jail releases me, the bus drops me off &lrm;right in front of a liquor store &lrm;on the corner."
00:59:13.666,00:59:17.583,"&lrm;I mean, after doing two years in jail, &lrm;what the fuck do you think &lrm;is gonna happen, man?"
00:59:17.708,00:59:19.958,&lrm;I'm gonna want a fucking drink.
00:59:20.416,00:59:22.041,&lrm;Right away I'm getting a bottle of brandy.
00:59:22.166,00:59:26.000,"&lrm;I'm already practically broke, &lrm;with the little money &lrm;that was left in my account."
00:59:26.208,00:59:27.291,"&lrm;So I call my boy, Caliph."
00:59:27.458,00:59:29.125,&lrm;He comes through with some more liquor.
00:59:29.291,00:59:30.291,"&lrm;Your boy's home, man."
00:59:30.458,00:59:31.833,&lrm;And some sticks of Xanax.
00:59:31.958,00:59:33.166,&lrm;My brother!
00:59:35.875,00:59:37.625,"&lrm;And by now, we're all fucked up."
00:59:37.791,00:59:40.916,&lrm;And I'm just feeling so good &lrm;that I don't even give a fuck.
00:59:41.041,00:59:43.458,&lrm;So we both walk over &lrm;to his boy Trevor's house.
00:59:43.708,00:59:56.125,"&lrm;This guy who has this hustle going &lrm;where he moves acid &lrm;for this guy in the Bronx &lrm;to this other guy in Long Island. &lrm;But what they do is, &lrm;they skim a couple of sheets off the top, &lrm;you know, so they could have some money &lrm;on the side for themselves &lrm;before they make the delivery."
01:00:00.250,01:00:02.458,"&lrm;Yo, son, hook me up, son."
01:00:02.958,01:00:04.625,&lrm;Finish her. &lrm;You're a three-minute man anyway.
01:00:04.750,01:00:06.708,"&lrm;Fuck, let me do my thing, man."
01:00:12.833,01:00:18.166,"&lrm;this PO's gonna read me the riot act, &lrm;'cause I'm fucking up already, &lrm;but, I mean..."
01:00:18.291,01:00:19.583,"&lrm;I'm feeling so great, and I'm fucked up."
01:00:19.708,01:00:22.041,&lrm;And I just don't give a fuck. &lrm;I'm celebrating.
01:00:22.166,01:00:23.250,&lrm;I'm not gonna spill it.
01:00:23.416,01:00:24.875,"&lrm;Yo, how much is this shit worth?"
01:00:25.333,01:00:27.375,&lrm;So I'm at the arcade with Trevor now.
01:00:27.708,01:00:30.041,"&lrm;You know, we're doing our thing, &lrm;hustling acid."
01:00:30.166,01:00:31.250,"&lrm;And, you know, we take over this place."
01:00:31.375,01:00:33.458,&lrm;Like it's our fucking office.
01:00:33.583,01:00:37.708,"&lrm;Once in a while someone will show up &lrm;and we'll make a sale, you know."
01:00:37.833,01:00:39.458,&lrm;Make a sale here. Make a sale there.
01:00:43.166,01:00:45.208,"&lrm;A little stronger than last time, I hope."
01:00:47.041,01:00:48.625,&lrm;this clown Donnie walks in.
01:00:49.500,01:00:50.416,&lrm;And he's all fucked up.
01:00:50.583,01:00:55.291,&lrm;And he's talking about &lrm;how he just robbed some &lrm;Radio Shack down the street.
01:00:55.458,01:00:57.000,"&lrm;Look, check this out."
01:00:59.416,01:01:06.875,"&lrm;so I can't follow this shit. &lrm;I'm having a hard time &lrm;following the story, &lrm;and I'm starting &lrm;to freak out a little bit."
01:01:07.041,01:01:08.541,&lrm;Bam! Right over his fucking head.
01:01:08.666,01:01:11.291,"&lrm;And then, guess what happens? &lrm;The fucking cops show up."
01:01:11.416,01:01:15.416,"&lrm;And the next thing I know, &lrm;Trevor's grabbing me, &lrm;and we just book it into &lrm;the parking lot."
01:01:15.583,01:01:18.416,"&lrm;And I just remember thinking &lrm;I could run for, like, 20 miles straight."
01:01:24.083,01:01:26.583,"&lrm;He leads us into Adventureland, &lrm;this amusement park."
01:01:26.750,01:01:30.125,"&lrm;At this point, I have no idea &lrm;what the fuck is going on."
01:01:30.625,01:01:33.500,"&lrm;And then Donnie leads us into this ride, &lrm;and they look for a place &lrm;to hide their shit."
01:01:33.666,01:01:34.916,&lrm;But it's fuckin' dark in there.
01:01:35.041,01:01:36.333,&lrm;I can't see shit.
01:01:36.500,01:01:39.750,"&lrm;All of a sudden, they get bagged, &lrm;I'm all by myself in the dark."
01:01:40.000,01:01:45.416,"&lrm;And literally &lrm;the next thing I remember is, &lrm;I'm fucking running down &lrm;some random street."
01:01:45.750,01:01:47.833,&lrm;And I just see a fucking cab.
01:01:48.000,01:01:50.000,"&lrm;And I hail it, and I just get in."
01:01:50.166,01:01:55.000,"&lrm;And this driver, &lrm;he just kept talking to me &lrm;and talking to me, &lrm;and I'm fucking tripping balls."
01:01:55.125,01:01:59.041,"&lrm;And I'm telling him, Please, please. &lrm;Just give me some peace and quiet, &lrm;or I'm going to throw up."
01:01:59.166,01:02:02.375,"&lrm;If you're going to throw up, &lrm;you give me my money right now &lrm;and you get out of this car."
01:02:03.833,01:02:07.458,"&lrm;Don't worry. &lrm;I'm going to go in the house, &lrm;I'll get the money from my bag."
01:02:07.583,01:02:09.208,"&lrm;I just got out of jail today, man. &lrm;I don't have shit."
01:02:09.333,01:02:12.583,"&lrm;As soon as he hears the word jail, &lrm;he fuckin' freaks."
01:02:12.708,01:02:15.583,"&lrm;Talking about, &lrm;Oh, I'm not getting ripped off &lrm;by one of you punks again."
01:02:15.708,01:02:16.833,&lrm;I am not getting fucked over!
01:02:17.916,01:02:21.333,"&lrm;steps on the gas, &lrm;and that was it. He just takes off."
01:02:21.458,01:02:23.833,&lrm;I'm gonna pay you. My mother's &lrm;gonna pay you. She has money.
01:02:23.958,01:02:25.208,"&lrm;I'm going to the police, okay!"
01:02:28.500,01:02:30.041,&lrm;I gotta get the fuck out of here.
01:02:30.166,01:02:31.791,&lrm;-Pull over. Fuck this. &lrm;-You are crazy!
01:02:33.666,01:02:36.625,&lrm;I'm not going back to jail. God damn it!
01:02:36.750,01:02:41.041,&lrm;So I happen to get one of the doors opened &lrm;before he locked them all. &lrm;This guy's crazy. He's fucking driving.
01:02:41.166,01:02:44.875,"&lrm;He's speeding down the road, &lrm;30, 40 miles an hour."
01:02:45.041,01:02:47.750,&lrm;And I know we're getting &lrm;closer and closer to the precinct.
01:02:47.875,01:02:49.750,&lrm;I know where my local precinct is. &lrm;It's not far.
01:02:49.875,01:02:52.125,&lrm;And I am not going back to jail.
01:02:52.291,01:02:55.375,&lrm;So I just looked down &lrm;at the pavement and just jump.
01:02:57.541,01:02:59.375,&lrm;And now look at my fucking face!
01:02:59.500,01:03:02.166,&lrm;I can't go walk around looking like this.
01:03:03.875,01:03:06.791,"&lrm;Yo. Yo, you listening to me?"
01:03:09.458,01:03:11.416,"&lrm;Yo, you fucking hear me?"
01:03:12.750,01:03:13.833,&lrm;Yo.
01:03:15.416,01:03:16.958,&lrm;Fucking serious?
01:03:17.500,01:03:18.458,&lrm;Hello?
01:03:19.583,01:03:20.583,&lrm;Hello!
01:03:22.541,01:03:24.125,&lrm;Tell you what I think.
01:03:24.250,01:03:27.625,"&lrm;I'm gonna drive us out there right now, &lrm;gonna go through the ride, &lrm;and we split what we find."
01:03:27.750,01:03:28.708,&lrm;All right?
01:03:28.833,01:03:30.166,"&lrm;What, to Adventurers? Right now?"
01:03:30.291,01:03:31.291,&lrm;Yes.
01:03:34.750,01:03:36.000,&lrm;Are you fucking serious?
01:03:36.166,01:03:38.291,&lrm;I should be in a fucking bed &lrm;somewhere right now.
01:03:38.458,01:03:41.041,&lrm;You have nowhere to go. You have no plan.
01:03:41.166,01:03:42.791,&lrm;And she's coming right now.
01:03:53.166,01:03:56.333,&lrm;Did you see all the activity &lrm;outside the hospital when we drove past?
01:03:56.458,01:03:57.750,"&lrm;Yeah, the police?"
01:03:57.875,01:04:01.166,"&lrm;Yeah. So I called over there, &lrm;and there's been a police incident."
01:04:01.291,01:04:03.375,&lrm;They're not going to discharge anyone &lrm;for an hour and a half.
01:04:03.500,01:04:04.958,&lrm;So what's going to happen &lrm;with your brother?
01:04:05.083,01:04:07.958,&lrm;I don't know. It's fuckin' nightmare. &lrm;I'm kinda fucked.
01:04:08.083,01:04:11.708,"&lrm;So I want to drop him off back at home, &lrm;then come back to the hospital afterwards."
01:04:13.416,01:04:15.708,"&lrm;So I'm gonna drop you off &lrm;back at home, right?"
01:04:17.791,01:04:19.583,"&lrm;Yeah, yeah, that sounds good."
01:04:20.625,01:04:22.416,"&lrm;Yeah, drive me home."
01:05:12.375,01:05:14.333,&lrm;Just pull up around back right here.
01:05:17.958,01:05:22.416,&lrm;I don't want to go around front &lrm;because then the dogs &lrm;are going to start barking &lrm;and wake everybody up and stuff. So...
01:05:30.291,01:05:32.791,&lrm;Get out for a second. &lrm;I need to talk to her.
01:05:44.916,01:05:48.666,"&lrm;You know what? Tonight, &lrm;it's fucked up as it is. I just think..."
01:05:50.666,01:05:54.541,"&lrm;I think something &lrm;very important is happening, &lrm;and it's deeply connected to my purpose."
01:05:54.666,01:05:58.333,&lrm;And I think that you are somehow &lrm;connected to it as well.
01:06:00.500,01:06:03.041,"&lrm;I mean, do you feel me at all? &lrm;Or do I just sound like a total faggot?"
01:06:03.500,01:06:05.791,"&lrm;No, I feel you. I understand."
01:06:09.458,01:06:12.458,"&lrm;Okay, I'm gonna go take a shit &lrm;in that guy's house."
01:06:12.625,01:06:15.416,&lrm;And we'll try the hospital &lrm;again in a minute.
01:06:15.541,01:06:17.541,"&lrm;-Just wait here for me, okay? &lrm;-All right."
01:06:51.375,01:06:53.083,"&lrm;Oh, fuck. Ow!"
01:06:56.166,01:06:58.416,&lrm;Power with your legs. Don't use your arms.
01:06:58.791,01:07:01.666,"&lrm;-Oh, fuck. Shit, man. &lrm;-Shut the fuck up!"
01:07:01.833,01:07:03.291,"&lrm;I can't do it, man."
01:07:03.416,01:07:04.583,&lrm;Tell me where it is. I'll be right back.
01:07:04.708,01:07:05.625,&lrm;I'm not telling you where it is.
01:07:05.750,01:07:06.958,&lrm;You can wait by the car.
01:07:07.083,01:07:08.625,&lrm;That's my ride as well as yours.
01:07:08.750,01:07:11.000,"&lrm;No, no, no way. &lrm;We find another way around or something."
01:07:11.125,01:07:13.916,"&lrm;If I have to come back over there, &lrm;I'm gonna kick the living shit out of you."
01:07:14.375,01:07:18.000,"&lrm;You keep pushing me, bro, and I'm gonna &lrm;forget how fucked up my shoulder is."
01:07:18.125,01:07:19.958,&lrm;Motherfucker.
01:07:29.458,01:07:30.875,"&lrm;You gotta help me over, bro."
01:07:32.583,01:07:33.708,&lrm;Come on.
01:07:37.750,01:07:38.625,&lrm;There we go.
01:07:39.750,01:07:40.875,&lrm;Go.
01:07:43.750,01:07:44.708,&lrm;I'm good.
01:07:46.625,01:07:47.583,&lrm;Oh!
01:07:47.750,01:07:49.500,"&lrm;Fuck me, bro!"
01:07:50.708,01:07:52.291,"&lrm;Oh, shit!"
01:07:53.208,01:07:54.750,&lrm;Fuck!
01:07:56.416,01:07:57.625,&lrm;Here we go.
01:08:25.958,01:08:27.000,&lrm;Um...
01:08:27.708,01:08:29.541,"&lrm;Yo, check this coffin."
01:08:43.750,01:08:47.208,"&lrm;Look, I'm not gonna spend &lrm;all night looking through &lrm;everything single thing in here, &lrm;so think, think harder."
01:08:48.416,01:08:50.583,"&lrm;It was fucking dark, like it is now."
01:08:51.083,01:08:52.291,"&lrm;It's gotta be farther, let's go father."
01:08:52.416,01:08:53.583,&lrm;Come on.
01:09:02.125,01:09:04.125,&lrm;This Egyptian shit.
01:09:04.291,01:09:06.833,"&lrm;I don't know. Maybe this tombstone, man."
01:09:07.000,01:09:08.375,&lrm;I think they stashed it here.
01:09:22.125,01:09:23.250,&lrm;Do you know how much this shit is worth?
01:09:26.583,01:09:28.125,&lrm;Do you recognize any of this?
01:09:38.500,01:09:40.041,&lrm;Y'all need to come out.
01:09:42.125,01:09:44.083,&lrm;Stop fucking with me right now.
01:09:44.791,01:09:46.458,&lrm;I already called the cops.
01:09:52.000,01:09:53.250,&lrm;Yo!
01:09:53.916,01:09:55.166,&lrm;Stop playin'.
01:09:55.958,01:09:57.750,&lrm;Y'all need to come out right now.
01:10:04.333,01:10:08.083,"&lrm;If I find you, &lrm;you gonna get your ass kicked."
01:10:20.791,01:10:22.583,&lrm;I'm not fucking around.
01:10:23.958,01:10:25.291,&lrm;Show your face.
01:10:31.625,01:10:32.708,&lrm;Hey!
01:10:36.083,01:10:37.916,&lrm;Shit. Fuck! Ow!
01:10:41.791,01:10:43.125,&lrm;Hey!
01:10:51.000,01:10:52.083,"&lrm;Oh, shit."
01:10:53.750,01:10:54.875,&lrm;Where's your friend?
01:10:55.000,01:10:57.708,&lrm;-I don't got no friend. &lrm;-I saw you on the monitor!
01:10:57.958,01:10:59.791,"&lrm;There's cameras here, okay?"
01:11:00.083,01:11:02.833,"&lrm;I got beat up. I'm the victim. &lrm;Look at me, man."
01:11:03.000,01:11:04.333,"&lrm;Oh, come on, bro."
01:11:10.416,01:11:12.666,"&lrm;Just let me go. You will never see &lrm;my face again, I promise."
01:11:12.791,01:11:14.541,&lrm;Let's wait for your boy to come out now.
01:11:14.666,01:11:15.541,"&lrm;Please, man. Come on, bro."
01:11:15.666,01:11:17.166,&lrm;Shut the fuck up.
01:11:23.875,01:11:24.958,&lrm;There he goes.
01:11:34.333,01:11:35.500,&lrm;Yo!
01:11:48.666,01:11:50.416,&lrm;Come on! Come on!
01:11:50.583,01:11:52.375,&lrm;Get me the fuck outta here!
01:11:53.083,01:11:54.583,&lrm;Yo! Yo!
01:11:54.708,01:11:55.625,&lrm;Open the door!
01:11:57.125,01:11:58.583,"&lrm;Yo, cut me the fuck &lrm;out of these things, man."
01:11:58.708,01:12:00.625,&lrm;There's got to be scissors somewhere.
01:12:07.916,01:12:09.208,&lrm;Let me see those things.
01:12:14.708,01:12:15.916,&lrm;Let's get the fuck out of here.
01:12:36.000,01:12:37.416,"&lrm;All right, let's leave him here."
01:12:37.583,01:12:38.583,&lrm;Keep looking.
01:12:38.875,01:12:41.125,&lrm;Go find it. &lrm;I want to be in and out of here.
01:12:41.500,01:12:42.750,&lrm;Damn you fucked him up.
01:12:42.916,01:12:45.250,"&lrm;I want to be in and out, all right? &lrm;In and out!"
01:12:47.666,01:12:49.916,"&lrm;Yo, does any of this black light shit &lrm;ring a bell?"
01:12:52.916,01:12:54.833,"&lrm;Look behind shit, like I'm doing."
01:12:55.000,01:12:58.541,"&lrm;The cops came in. &lrm;They stashed it really quick, man."
01:13:00.375,01:13:02.458,&lrm;-What about the boat thing? &lrm;-The what?
01:13:02.625,01:13:04.458,&lrm;The boat. Did you look through the boat?
01:13:29.541,01:13:32.583,&lrm;Hello! Nassau County Police. &lrm;Anybody in there?
01:13:34.750,01:13:36.666,&lrm;Fuck! Fuck!
01:13:46.291,01:13:47.916,&lrm;Nassau County Police!
01:13:53.375,01:13:54.208,"&lrm;Shit, man."
01:14:15.750,01:14:18.000,&lrm;Go look for a hiding spot. &lrm;Don't leave the ride.
01:14:18.125,01:14:19.583,"&lrm;Hold on, hold on."
01:14:19.750,01:14:24.375,&lrm;This motherfucker's &lrm;not gonna remember shit &lrm;when he wakes up. Open the fucking mouth.
01:14:43.625,01:14:44.791,"&lrm;Oh, there you are."
01:14:44.958,01:14:46.041,&lrm;What happened? &lrm;We were yelling at the gate.
01:14:46.166,01:14:49.250,"&lrm;Sorry, man, I couldn't hear anything. &lrm;He's inside here."
01:14:57.166,01:14:58.791,"&lrm;-He's just here. &lrm;-Oh, shit."
01:14:58.958,01:15:00.416,&lrm;What happened to him?
01:15:01.666,01:15:06.041,"&lrm;I just heard a ton of noise outside. &lrm;I just walked in here, &lrm;and he's just layin' there like this... &lrm;Unconscious, I guess."
01:15:06.166,01:15:07.375,&lrm;What happened to the other one?
01:15:07.500,01:15:08.666,&lrm;Could we get a bus for a...
01:15:10.000,01:15:11.791,"&lrm;As soon as I turned the lights on, &lrm;everybody ran off."
01:15:11.916,01:15:13.500,&lrm;Is he still in the park?
01:15:13.625,01:15:14.791,&lrm;Maybe. I don't know.
01:15:19.041,01:15:21.416,"&lrm;Uh... Yeah, just give me &lrm;a couple of minutes."
01:15:37.958,01:15:39.166,&lrm;Hold on.
01:15:39.291,01:15:40.208,"&lrm;Let me call you back, hold on."
01:15:40.333,01:15:42.291,&lrm;'Cause I just peeped something.
01:16:01.583,01:16:03.958,&lrm;Stop! Stop! Turn around.
01:16:04.500,01:16:05.708,&lrm;Turn around.
01:16:14.791,01:16:15.750,&lrm;He's moving good oxygen.
01:16:15.875,01:16:18.458,&lrm;Those whacks are pretty nasty &lrm;on his forehead though.
01:16:18.583,01:16:21.708,"&lrm;Hey, bud. Hey. Hey. What's going on, man?"
01:16:21.833,01:16:25.000,&lrm;Hey. You awake? Hello. Hello.
01:16:31.166,01:16:34.666,"&lrm;Hey, man, it's all right. &lrm;It's all right. Relax. Relax. Relax."
01:16:36.833,01:16:38.291,"&lrm;There goes that drug use, huh?"
01:16:42.250,01:16:43.708,&lrm;Make sure you got his legs.
01:16:43.875,01:16:45.000,"&lrm;All right, all right, all right."
01:16:50.833,01:16:53.208,"&lrm;Relax. All right, I got his arms."
01:16:53.375,01:16:54.500,&lrm;You get under.
01:16:55.125,01:16:57.416,&lrm;Take your time. One. Two. Three.
01:16:58.500,01:17:01.750,"&lrm;All right, let's put him on a stretcher."
01:17:05.583,01:17:06.791,&lrm;All right.
01:17:06.916,01:17:10.208,"&lrm;Get off of me! Why are you still &lrm;holding me, sir? Get off!"
01:17:11.625,01:17:15.708,"&lrm;Get off! Get off of me! &lrm;Wait, I just explained myself to you."
01:17:15.875,01:17:16.875,&lrm;I didn't have to do that.
01:17:25.666,01:17:26.500,&lrm;Yo!
01:17:27.791,01:17:29.958,&lrm;Is this the one that was running around?
01:17:37.750,01:17:39.541,&lrm;Look at me. How old are you?
01:17:39.666,01:17:41.833,&lrm;-I'm sixteen. &lrm;-Where's your ID?
01:17:41.958,01:17:43.291,&lrm;What are you doing here?
01:17:43.416,01:17:44.541,&lrm;You don't want... You don't know...
01:17:44.666,01:17:47.458,&lrm;You don't want to talk to me? &lrm;Come on. You're outta here.
01:17:47.625,01:17:49.708,&lrm;I don't got time for this shit.
01:17:51.833,01:17:54.875,"&lrm;We'll find somebody that'll talk to us &lrm;and tell you why you're here, all right?"
01:17:56.791,01:17:59.000,&lrm;Get her outta here. I'll start her 61.
01:18:10.625,01:18:13.666,&lrm;Yeah. I'm just looking for a patient &lrm;who's currently in the hospital.
01:18:13.791,01:18:15.541,&lrm;I'm just checking to see if he's okay.
01:18:18.666,01:18:20.333,&lrm;N-I-K-A-S.
01:18:20.458,01:18:23.250,&lrm;N-I-K-A-S.
01:18:23.375,01:18:24.916,&lrm;Do you have a floor or wing or something?
01:18:25.083,01:18:27.041,"&lrm;No. No, I don't know anything."
01:18:27.208,01:18:28.625,"&lrm;All right, please hold."
01:18:48.000,01:18:49.291,&lrm;Hello?
01:18:49.458,01:18:50.416,"&lrm;Yeah, I'm sorry."
01:18:50.541,01:18:53.250,&lrm;I'm unable to release any information &lrm;regarding that inmate.
01:18:53.375,01:18:54.958,&lrm;Why not? I'm a family member.
01:18:55.083,01:18:59.625,"&lrm;Like I said, I'm not allowed &lrm;to release or to disclose &lrm;any information about..."
01:19:08.875,01:19:09.958,&lrm;Yo!
01:19:16.291,01:19:17.708,&lrm;We're leavin'.
01:19:17.875,01:19:20.250,"&lrm;Yo, are we good, man? Are they gone?"
01:19:27.791,01:19:28.666,"&lrm;Yo, wait up!"
01:20:02.166,01:20:03.458,&lrm;Let me in.
01:20:03.583,01:20:04.541,&lrm;You have the acid?
01:20:04.666,01:20:05.541,&lrm;Yeah.
01:20:06.250,01:20:07.166,&lrm;Get in the back.
01:20:15.958,01:20:17.041,&lrm;I gotta warn my family.
01:20:17.166,01:20:18.750,&lrm;If they call that fucking &lrm;stupid girl's number back...
01:20:18.875,01:20:21.541,"&lrm;If she's with the cops, &lrm;then I'm fucked, bro."
01:20:21.875,01:20:26.000,"&lrm;They might trick my mom &lrm;into saying something stupid, &lrm;like I... Like I called her earlier."
01:20:27.625,01:20:28.625,"&lrm;Fuck, man."
01:20:30.833,01:20:32.416,&lrm;We're going to his house.
01:20:32.541,01:20:34.833,&lrm;Lay down. Make yourself invisible.
01:22:29.583,01:22:30.583,&lrm;Hello?
01:22:36.541,01:22:37.708,&lrm;Hello?
01:23:02.083,01:23:03.166,&lrm;Hey.
01:23:04.458,01:23:05.583,&lrm;Come here.
01:23:07.291,01:23:08.833,&lrm;Smell the coat. Smell the coal.
01:23:08.958,01:23:10.333,&lrm;Smell that. Go on.
01:23:10.458,01:23:12.041,&lrm;You smell it? You smell it?
01:23:12.791,01:23:14.333,"&lrm;Come here, come here."
01:23:15.500,01:23:16.458,&lrm;Come on.
01:23:35.833,01:23:40.166,&lrm;...getting 46 million dollars &lrm;in funding for upgraded infrastructure.
01:23:44.208,01:23:47.125,"&lrm;...35,000 feet of new sewers, &lrm;water mains, and sidewalks."
01:23:47.250,01:23:49.333,"&lrm;Shit, that's what I'm talking about."
01:23:51.375,01:23:55.958,"&lrm;Man, this is a nice fucking place. &lrm;I wish I had a fucking place like this."
01:24:05.375,01:24:07.416,"&lrm;How much money can you get for this &lrm;right now, tonight?"
01:24:07.541,01:24:08.541,&lrm;What?
01:24:08.666,01:24:11.791,&lrm;For the acid. Who can you call &lrm;to get some money for this &lrm;right now tonight?
01:24:11.958,01:24:13.375,&lrm;I want to move it right now.
01:24:13.708,01:24:16.375,"&lrm;That doesn't belong to me. &lrm;That belongs to my boy, Caliph."
01:24:16.500,01:24:18.125,"&lrm;Well, then he can pay me for it."
01:24:18.250,01:24:20.750,"&lrm;Fuck that, man. &lrm;I'm the one who found it. Not you."
01:24:20.875,01:24:22.083,&lrm;You wouldn't have found &lrm;anything without me.
01:24:22.250,01:24:24.125,&lrm;You were handcuffed &lrm;to a bed in a hospital.
01:24:24.708,01:24:26.875,&lrm;What do you think I'm doing this for? &lrm;You think I'm doing this for charity?
01:24:27.000,01:24:30.208,&lrm;All right. You're right. &lrm;You got a point. I hear you.
01:24:30.750,01:24:32.083,&lrm;Listen. My boy will hook you up.
01:24:32.208,01:24:33.666,&lrm;He'll throw some money your way.
01:24:33.833,01:24:36.125,"&lrm;But, my point is, it's not up to me. &lrm;I gotta call him, all right?"
01:24:36.291,01:24:37.291,&lrm;-It's not up to me. &lrm;-You're right.
01:24:37.416,01:24:38.541,&lrm;It's not up to you.
01:24:38.708,01:24:40.958,&lrm;So get on the phone &lrm;and call him right now.
01:24:41.083,01:24:42.041,&lrm;Plug the phone in. Charge it.
01:24:43.000,01:24:44.708,&lrm;-And give me a minute. &lrm;-It doesn't need to be charged.
01:24:44.875,01:24:46.166,"&lrm;I want to relax for a minute, man."
01:24:46.291,01:24:47.333,"&lrm;It's been a long fucking night, you know."
01:24:47.458,01:24:48.458,&lrm;I don't give a fuck if you want to relax.
01:24:48.583,01:24:52.666,"&lrm;You gotta get on the phone &lrm;right now, and you gotta &lrm;make sure it's plugged &lrm;into the wall 'cause &lrm;-otherwise it doesn't work. &lrm;-Give me a minute, bro."
01:24:52.791,01:24:53.875,&lrm;Goddamn.
01:24:59.541,01:25:00.791,&lrm;Call him now.
01:25:06.250,01:25:11.000,&lrm;Officials say an anonymous tip &lrm;about emaciated dogs prompted &lrm;an investigation by law enforcement.
01:25:11.125,01:25:12.875,&lrm;They will soon be available for adoption.
01:25:13.000,01:25:15.208,&lrm;Now an update on last week's &lrm;bank robbery in Flushing.
01:25:15.375,01:25:21.166,"&lrm;Authorities are still searching &lrm;for Constantine Nikas, suspected &lrm;of carrying out the robbery &lrm;along with his brother."
01:25:21.291,01:25:26.416,&lrm;Nikolas Nikas was arrested near the scene &lrm;after crashing &lrm;through a plate-glass window &lrm;at the New World Mall.
01:25:26.541,01:25:29.500,&lrm;He's currently being held &lrm;at the Queens Detention Center &lrm;awaiting a court appearance.
01:25:29.625,01:25:31.125,&lrm;Today the brothers' grandmother &lrm;is speaking out...
01:25:31.291,01:25:33.458,&lrm;So how much time are you facing?
01:25:33.583,01:25:36.666,&lrm;She joins us now from Flushing &lrm;with the details.
01:25:39.708,01:25:40.750,"&lrm;Come on, man, look at me."
01:25:40.875,01:25:42.416,"&lrm;...one exclusive, Agapia Nikas..."
01:25:45.208,01:25:48.208,&lrm;I know your situation &lrm;can't be worse than mine.
01:25:48.666,01:25:52.208,&lrm;Everybody goes through shit. &lrm;I'm the last one to judge.
01:25:54.791,01:25:56.791,&lrm;that left her with a broken arm.
01:25:56.916,01:25:58.541,&lrm;You ever do time before?
01:26:06.750,01:26:09.666,"&lrm;Why you gotta be such a fuckin' &lrm;little prick all the time, man?"
01:26:11.458,01:26:12.708,&lrm;and now you wanna get real with me?
01:26:15.583,01:26:17.833,&lrm;I'm not trying to get real with you.
01:26:17.958,01:26:19.291,&lrm;You know what? I'm fucking real.
01:26:19.416,01:26:20.250,&lrm;Fuck.
01:26:22.541,01:26:25.291,"&lrm;Go fuck yourself, man. &lrm;You think you're better than me."
01:26:25.583,01:26:26.750,&lrm;I am better than you.
01:26:29.375,01:26:31.625,"&lrm;No one's better &lrm;than any next man, all right?"
01:26:31.791,01:26:33.000,&lrm;You don't know me from Adam.
01:26:33.125,01:26:36.000,"&lrm;The second you got here, &lrm;you went to the booze &lrm;and you got fucked up. But that's fine."
01:26:36.125,01:26:37.125,&lrm;-So the fuck what? &lrm;-So that's who...
01:26:37.250,01:26:39.000,&lrm;That's just who you are. You're a fuckup.
01:26:39.166,01:26:41.041,&lrm;That's it. I don't care. &lrm;Whatever. I don't give a shit.
01:26:41.166,01:26:42.666,&lrm;You shouldn't give a shit. &lrm;Who gives a shit?
01:26:42.791,01:26:44.458,&lrm;I... I definitely don't give a shit.
01:26:44.583,01:26:46.916,&lrm;Look. Losers like you are incapable &lrm;of taking care of themselves.
01:26:47.041,01:26:51.583,&lrm;You're either leeching off mommy &lrm;or leeching off welfare &lrm;or living off the government in jail.
01:26:51.708,01:26:52.666,&lrm;That's you!
01:26:52.833,01:26:54.625,"&lrm;You don't know the first thing &lrm;about me, bro."
01:26:54.750,01:26:56.333,&lrm;What's to know? What's to know?
01:26:56.500,01:26:58.291,&lrm;You serve absolutely &lrm;no function whatsoever.
01:26:58.458,01:26:59.375,&lrm;It's pathetic.
01:27:00.000,01:27:06.750,"&lrm;I probably made more money &lrm;in the last two years &lrm;than you did &lrm;in your whole fucking life, man."
01:27:06.875,01:27:11.541,"&lrm;Let's see, man, &lrm;a couple of years from now, &lrm;you ever seen me driving by &lrm;in my fucking Lambo."
01:27:11.708,01:27:14.875,"&lrm;You're gonna put your fuckin' foot &lrm;so far up your mouth, bro."
01:27:15.666,01:27:17.833,&lrm;You don't know &lrm;what I'm talking about at all.
01:27:21.000,01:27:22.208,&lrm;'Bout fuckin' time.
01:27:33.125,01:27:34.000,&lrm;Hello.
01:27:34.166,01:27:35.416,"&lrm;Yo, it's Caliph. Buzz me up."
01:27:45.625,01:27:46.708,"&lrm;Yo, come on. Get in, man."
01:27:46.833,01:27:48.541,"&lrm;What the fuck happened &lrm;to your face, nigga?"
01:27:48.708,01:27:50.291,&lrm;-I told you it was fucked up. &lrm;-You didn't tell me it was like this.
01:27:50.500,01:27:51.708,&lrm;It is. It is.
01:27:51.875,01:27:53.541,"&lrm;Aw, I can't even fuckin' look at you, man."
01:27:53.708,01:27:54.625,&lrm;It's disgusting.
01:27:54.750,01:27:56.625,&lrm;Then don't look at me. &lrm;I don't know what to tell you.
01:27:59.291,01:28:01.375,&lrm;-with this fucker. &lrm;-What are you whispering about?
01:28:01.500,01:28:03.541,"&lrm;Listen. &lrm;This guy's fuckin' shot up, all right?"
01:28:03.666,01:28:06.125,"&lrm;-I just want to get this shit over with. &lrm;-Man, fuck this shit."
01:28:07.458,01:28:09.500,"&lrm;-Yo, what's up? &lrm;-Shut the door!"
01:28:09.625,01:28:12.541,&lrm;What the fuck! You didn't tell me &lrm;there was a fucking dog in there.
01:28:12.708,01:28:14.125,"&lrm;Fucking forgot about that, man. &lrm;That's my bad."
01:28:14.250,01:28:15.416,&lrm;What the fuck!
01:28:20.083,01:28:23.041,"&lrm;I thought we were gonna talk &lrm;about this shit first, &lrm;and then decide."
01:28:23.166,01:28:24.750,&lrm;So you brought nothing.
01:28:25.041,01:28:26.625,&lrm;I need to know what the fuck &lrm;I'm payin' for.
01:28:31.000,01:28:32.500,&lrm;and got the shit the other day myself.
01:28:32.625,01:28:34.666,"&lrm;All right, both of you get out. &lrm;We're done."
01:28:36.250,01:28:39.333,"&lrm;Yo. Just give him whatever you got, &lrm;and let's get the fuck outta here."
01:28:39.500,01:28:42.541,"&lrm;I'm gonna go get $1,000 from the ATM &lrm;and bring it right back."
01:28:42.666,01:28:45.083,"&lrm;I want 15,000, not 1,000."
01:28:45.208,01:28:48.125,"&lrm;How am I gonna get 15,000 from an ATM, &lrm;you crazy motherfucker?"
01:28:50.291,01:28:51.250,&lrm;-Both of you. &lrm;-Don't give him shit.
01:28:51.416,01:28:52.583,&lrm;How 'bout we do this?
01:28:52.708,01:28:57.375,"&lrm;I'll go to the ATM right now, &lrm;and I'm gonna take out $1,000 times three."
01:28:57.500,01:28:58.500,&lrm;-Three Gs for you... &lrm;-No.
01:28:58.666,01:29:01.125,&lrm;-From the ATM in 30 minutes. &lrm;-No. Not good enough!
01:29:01.791,01:29:04.458,&lrm;All right. I'm gonna go &lrm;to the motherfuckin' bank.
01:29:04.625,01:29:07.958,&lrm;It's gonna take me about three hours &lrm;to get you the fifteen Gs.
01:29:08.083,01:29:09.708,&lrm;You want to sit here &lrm;and wait here like a dick?
01:29:11.958,01:29:13.583,"&lrm;Okay, great. Fine."
01:29:16.875,01:29:19.166,&lrm;That guy's full of fuckin' shit. &lrm;He's an asshole.
01:29:19.291,01:29:21.416,&lrm;You see what the fuck &lrm;I've been dealin' with all fuckin' night?
01:29:21.541,01:29:22.958,"&lrm;Yeah, I get it. I get it."
01:29:23.083,01:29:26.208,&lrm;I'm gonna fuckin' go right now. &lrm;I'll be back at 9:30.
01:29:27.125,01:29:29.083,"&lrm;Keep your eye on him, all right?"
01:29:29.250,01:29:32.333,&lrm;I'm gonna go to the BX. &lrm;I'm gonna get with Tasha.
01:29:32.458,01:29:33.958,&lrm;And then I'll be back.
01:29:34.083,01:29:35.208,&lrm;That's what I'm talking about.
01:29:35.333,01:29:36.583,&lrm;Hold him the fuck down.
01:29:36.708,01:29:38.208,"&lrm;Yeah. I'll see you, all right?"
01:29:46.291,01:29:47.166,&lrm;Yo!
01:29:56.083,01:29:57.333,&lrm;What?
01:30:00.083,01:30:01.250,&lrm;What are you doing?
01:30:05.541,01:30:06.416,&lrm;I told you. I'm done.

01:31:48.041,01:31:49.083,&lrm;The Sprite bottle. You can't miss it.
01:31:49.208,01:31:51.500,&lrm;It's right out front. You can't miss it.
01:31:52.958,01:31:55.500,&lrm;I'll call you back. &lrm;You never talked to me. Bye.

01:34:57.833,01:34:58.958,"&lrm;Good to see you, Nick."

01:35:03.041,01:35:05.625,"&lrm;And I gotta tell you, &lrm;that is a very cool haircut."
01:35:05.750,01:35:07.416,&lrm;You look really sharp.
01:35:07.541,01:35:10.083,"&lrm;Mrs. Nikas, it's so good to see you, too."
01:35:10.208,01:35:12.125,&lrm;-Good to see you. &lrm;-Thank you for bringing Nick in.
01:35:12.250,01:35:14.041,&lrm;Thank you very much for everything.
01:35:14.208,01:35:15.666,"&lrm;Okay. Listen, I want you to come with me."
01:35:15.791,01:35:17.041,&lrm;I'm gonna take you someplace.
01:35:17.208,01:35:19.166,&lrm;I just enrolled you &lrm;in this really terrific class.
01:35:19.291,01:35:22.041,&lrm;I'm gonna walk you there right now. &lrm;You are gonna love it.
01:35:25.416,01:35:29.000,"&lrm;You know, Nick, I have to tell you, &lrm;what Connie did. &lrm;Connie did the right thing."
01:35:29.125,01:35:31.666,&lrm;He did the really responsible thing.
01:35:31.791,01:35:34.833,"&lrm;And the best news is, &lrm;he's right where he belongs."
01:35:35.000,01:35:36.500,&lrm;And you're right where you belong.
01:35:36.666,01:35:40.791,"&lrm;And I gotta tell you, &lrm;this place where we are now &lrm;can be a lot of fun if you let it."
01:35:40.958,01:35:42.166,"&lrm;You know that, don't you?"
01:35:52.250,01:35:53.666,&lrm;Please excuse me for interrupting.
01:35:53.791,01:35:56.208,&lrm;I just want everybody &lrm;to meet my friend Nick.
01:35:56.375,01:35:57.458,"&lrm;Nick, say hi to everybody."
01:36:04.333,01:36:05.291,&lrm;-Hi. &lrm;-Aubrey conducts this class.
01:36:05.583,01:36:07.250,&lrm;I've seen these classes. They're great.
01:36:07.375,01:36:09.000,&lrm;I think you're gonna like it. &lrm;It's a lot of fun.
01:36:10.666,01:36:13.333,"&lrm;That's okay. There's a lot of people here &lrm;that are new, too. You're not alone."
01:36:13.458,01:36:15.250,&lrm;You're gonna have a good time. &lrm;And I'll be right out here.
01:36:15.375,01:36:16.291,&lrm;I'm just going to be waiting for you.
01:36:27.583,01:36:29.000,"&lrm;Hey, guys, say hi to Nick one more time."
01:36:33.500,01:36:36.916,&lrm;we're gonna get to know &lrm;each other a little bit more &lrm;and play something &lrm;called Cross The Room.
01:36:37.583,01:36:40.500,&lrm;So I'd love everyone to divide up &lrm;on one side of the room.
01:36:40.625,01:36:42.000,"&lrm;Nick, this way, thank you."
01:36:42.125,01:36:44.375,"&lrm;Uh, Rodney, you can actually &lrm;get over here."
01:36:44.500,01:36:46.000,&lrm;Backari next to Andrew.
01:36:46.125,01:36:47.250,&lrm;Perfect.
01:36:47.375,01:36:50.500,&lrm;Okay. I'm going to give you a prompt.
01:36:50.666,01:36:54.875,"&lrm;I'm gonna say, &lrm;Cross the room if you like something."
01:36:55.000,01:36:57.458,&lrm;Cross the room &lrm;if you want to do something.
01:36:57.625,01:37:00.750,&lrm;Cross the room if you have &lrm;ever done something.
01:37:01.125,01:37:05.625,"&lrm;And if you have or agree &lrm;with those prompts, &lrm;you would cross the room."
01:37:05.791,01:37:09.625,"&lrm;Now, &lrm;you choose whether or not &lrm;you want to cross."
01:37:09.791,01:37:11.541,&lrm;You don't have to.
01:37:11.666,01:37:13.250,&lrm;It could be your secret.
01:37:13.416,01:37:15.333,&lrm;You choose your truth. Okay?
01:37:16.625,01:37:18.375,&lrm;So let's start with something easy.
01:37:18.500,01:37:23.208,&lrm;Cross the room if you like candy.
01:37:27.000,01:37:30.458,&lrm;Mikey and Michael don't like candy? Okay.
01:37:30.833,01:37:32.875,&lrm;How about something harder?
01:37:33.041,01:37:36.000,&lrm;Cross the room &lrm;if you've ever been in love.
01:37:41.458,01:37:42.625,&lrm;Okay.
01:37:42.791,01:37:47.666,&lrm;Cross the room if you have ever lied.
01:37:54.041,01:37:58.583,&lrm;Cross the room &lrm;if you've ever not gotten along &lrm;with your family members sometimes.
01:38:05.958,01:38:08.041,&lrm;Does anybody have another suggestion?
01:38:09.416,01:38:14.666,"&lrm;-Oh, sorry, guys. &lrm;-Cross the room &lrm;if you've ever been blamed for something &lrm;that you didn't do."
01:38:21.500,01:38:27.166,"&lrm;Cross the room if you've ever been &lrm;to New Year's Eve, &lrm;Christmas at Rockefeller Center."
01:38:40.083,01:38:43.083,&lrm;anything stupid with your friends.
01:38:44.750,01:38:46.583,&lrm;something stupid with your friends.
01:38:49.791,01:38:53.583,"&lrm;-Mikey, do you have a suggestion? &lrm;-Yeah, cross the room..."
01:38:56.166,01:39:01.250,&lrm;if you have not been to Dream Street.
01:39:08.500,01:39:09.750,&lrm;Samantha?
01:39:11.041,01:39:15.000,&lrm;if you'd really love to mentor &lrm;special ed nursery school.
01:39:16.833,01:39:18.583,&lrm;or want to mentor special needs children.
01:39:22.750,01:39:25.083,&lrm;Cross the room if you have a friend.
01:39:32.416,01:39:33.583,&lrm;Megan?
01:39:43.458,01:39:47.208,&lrm;if you like musicals.
01:39:48.416,01:39:49.875,&lrm;Do an easy one.
01:40:06.250,01:40:11.791,&lrm;Cross the room if you've ever felt &lrm;like you spend too much time at home.
01:40:46.833,01:41:01.750,&lrm;We're gonna go to a place where we can do &lrm;Everything we want to &lrm;And we can pet the crocodiles &lrm;Love.
