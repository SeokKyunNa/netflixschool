00:00:35.275,00:00:36.255,Who is this?
00:00:53.136,00:00:54.304,It's just a scary movie.
00:01:01.812,00:01:03.564,"Oh, I know. Um, Kazaam."
00:01:03.647,00:01:05.524,"You know, the one where Shaq plays a genie."
00:01:16.451,00:01:17.911,Why do you wanna know my name?
00:01:23.166,00:01:25.127,What-- What did you say?
00:01:25.794,00:01:26.962,Nice breasts.
00:01:28.005,00:01:29.631,"Look, what do you want?"
00:01:32.426,00:01:34.803,"Well-- Well, then turn to page 54."
00:01:34.961,00:01:38.265,"Oh. Hey, nice."
00:01:40.475,00:01:44.354,"Listen, asshole, you've had your fun, now, you better stop or else."
00:01:45.856,00:01:49.818,"Or else my boyfriend's gonna be here any minute, and he's Black and he'll kick your ass."
00:02:03.915,00:02:06.376,Help! Help!
00:02:06.710,00:02:08.378,"Oh, that's not my boyfriend."
00:02:08.670,00:02:10.797,"I mean, I've fucked him a couple of times, but that's it."
00:02:17.012,00:02:19.514,But you might wanna check the back door first.
00:02:19.890,00:02:21.558,You forgot to lock it.
00:03:02.307,00:03:03.308,"Hello, Drew."
00:03:17.823,00:03:18.824,"Oh, God!"
00:03:34.965,00:03:35.966,No!
00:04:09.499,00:04:10.584,No!
00:04:27.017,00:04:28.560,Daddy!
00:04:32.105,00:04:33.273,"Daddy, no!"
00:04:37.277,00:04:38.320,Did you hear something?
00:05:08.683,00:05:11.394,"Bobby, what are you doing? My dad's in the other room."
00:05:11.478,00:05:12.479,It just occurred to me.
00:05:12.562,00:05:14.272,I never climbed through your window before.
00:05:14.356,00:05:16.608,"Yeah, well, now that you got it out of your system… Bobby!"
00:05:16.748,00:05:17.859,-What? -You have to leave.
00:05:19.569,00:05:20.737,"Shh, come on."
00:05:22.322,00:05:23.323,What's going on in there?
00:05:30.205,00:05:32.207,Knock? I thought I heard screaming in here.
00:05:34.876,00:05:37.379,"Well, it-- It could've been that crack I smoked earlier, I guess."
00:05:37.504,00:05:39.047,"-Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah, that's what it was."
00:05:39.422,00:05:41.299,"Listen, I gotta leave town for a couple days, okay?"
00:05:41.397,00:05:42.352,No big deal.
00:05:42.497,00:05:44.875,"Just, you know, that new business I started with those Colombian guys?"
00:05:45.050,00:05:46.179,"Oh, you mean Uncle Escobar."
00:05:46.263,00:05:47.222,"-Yeah. Yeah, that's right. -Yeah."
00:05:47.345,00:05:48.604,"Well, there's a problem."
00:05:48.729,00:05:51.643,Some money went missing and apparently some legs are gonna get broken.
00:05:51.726,00:05:53.895,Ah! It's just better if I lay low for a couple days.
00:05:54.354,00:05:56.773,"-Okay. -Now, if the cops raid the place… I never heard of you."
00:05:56.914,00:05:59.192,-And don't forget… -To flush your stash.
00:06:01.494,00:06:04.281,I love you so much that I left you a little something in the coffee can.
00:06:08.118,00:06:15.564,"-Now, what are you gonna cut it with? -Um, baking… Because baking powder, guys will have muffins growing out of their nose."
00:06:18.587,00:06:20.881,You've loved that joke since you were two-years-old.
00:06:25.010,00:06:26.052,Have a good trip.
00:06:34.269,00:06:36.938,That was close. God!
00:06:40.692,00:06:45.488,"I was, uh, home watching The Exorcist and it got me thinking about you."
00:06:45.655,00:06:51.995,"If this is about the time I puked green slime and masturbated with a crucifix, it was my first keg party, Bobby."
00:06:52.162,00:06:56.625,"No. No. Uh, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cutout."
00:06:56.750,00:07:01.212,So you thought you would just climb through my window and we would play bump-bump?
00:07:01.862,00:07:06.217,"Oh, I was kind of hoping to get my balls licked, but I wouldn't wanna break your little underwear rule, now, would I?"
00:07:07.302,00:07:10.055,So maybe just some on-top-of-the-clothes type stuff?
00:07:13.391,00:07:14.809,-Okay. -Hmm?
00:07:14.893,00:07:16.394,-But just for a minute. -All right.
00:07:31.676,00:07:35.647,The h… Wrong set.
00:07:39.668,00:07:42.504,"Bobby! Oh, Bobby!"
00:07:53.723,00:07:55.016,"-Yeah -Yeah, my dad."
00:07:56.977,00:08:00.230,"Okay, stud, you have to go now."
00:08:04.526,00:08:06.403,"Oh, um, about the sex stuff?"
00:08:07.153,00:08:09.406,"I was only half serious. I mean, I don't wanna rush you or anything."
00:08:10.073,00:08:12.534,"Hey, would you settle for PG-13?"
00:08:12.826,00:08:13.743,What's that?
00:08:29.634,00:08:32.095,And make sure you take your behind to class today.
00:08:32.178,00:08:35.432,"-I do be going to class. -Lunch is not a class, Shorty."
00:08:42.355,00:08:45.775,"You my brother. That's your mother too, jackass."
00:08:49.863,00:08:51.322,So? I don't know him.
00:08:52.365,00:08:53.366,"Yeah, me neither."
00:09:07.005,00:09:09.758,-She is such a ho. -Why do you say that?
00:09:11.885,00:09:13.803,My friend Sean had a pool party this summer.
00:09:13.887,00:09:15.847,"-Sean? -You know, Puff Daddy?"
00:09:16.848,00:09:19.225,"Anyway, everybody was drinking Cristal champagne."
00:09:19.374,00:09:22.624,And then it started to get wild and people was getting freaky in the pool and stuff.
00:09:22.771,00:09:27.317,I look over and there was your girl getting buck wild in the Jacuzzi.
00:09:27.400,00:09:28.443,So?
00:09:29.110,00:09:33.490,"With a backup dancer. I mean, that's nasty."
00:09:33.865,00:09:35.784,That's-- That's lower than the security guard.
00:09:35.950,00:09:38.244,At least security can get you backstage.
00:09:38.745,00:09:39.871,She don't love herself.
00:09:41.581,00:09:43.208,"I think Buffy's sweet, Brenda."
00:09:43.333,00:09:46.461,"Oh, she is as fake as press-on nails."
00:09:51.216,00:09:52.634,"What is up, my sister?"
00:09:52.884,00:09:55.053,"-Bye, Mr. Gilmore. -Bye!"
00:10:10.860,00:10:12.821,-I love this color. -Let me see that.
00:10:15.406,00:10:18.868,"-Oh, you guys should not use this brand. -Why not?"
00:10:18.943,00:10:21.093,Because they test their products on animals.
00:10:21.201,00:10:22.076,So?
00:10:22.201,00:10:25.917,"Look, have you seen what they do to those poor animals?"
00:10:28.711,00:10:31.923,"Well, I am much more of a people person."
00:10:32.465,00:10:35.385,"I'd like to feed all the hungry, little children of the world."
00:10:35.476,00:10:37.626,I'd much rather help my fellow man than some animal.
00:10:37.701,00:10:39.931,"-Spare a dollar? -Ew, get away from me, you bum!"
00:10:40.056,00:10:42.767,Buffy! Can't you see he's just hungry?
00:10:43.351,00:10:45.770,"Here you go, sir. A nice sandwich."
00:10:47.105,00:10:48.148,See?
00:10:48.940,00:10:50.608,"I said a dollar, bitch!"
00:10:51.359,00:10:52.360,Ow!
00:10:55.155,00:10:58.199,Look at this place. It's a circus.
00:10:58.867,00:11:03.371,"Hello, I'm Gail Hailstorm, author of the book, You're Dead, I'm Rich."
00:11:03.913,00:11:08.001,A small college town is in shock after the unthinkable has happened.
00:11:08.501,00:11:16.134,A brutal killing spree that left one teen dead-- Two teens dead and this small town shaken and stirred.
00:11:16.509,00:11:19.804,It's times like these… Police are combing the area for clues.
00:11:19.929,00:11:24.100,It seems there are no witnesses available at this time… There are no suspects in custody.
00:11:24.267,00:11:27.187,Police are asking anyone to come forward… Reporting live for Black TV!
00:11:27.269,00:11:29.219,White folks are dead and we're getting the fuck out of here!
00:11:29.314,00:11:32.650,"Let's roll, driver! Come on, grab your shit and let's go, motherfucker!"
00:11:36.279,00:11:39.490,"Hey, do you think the press is gonna wanna talk to us?"
00:11:41.081,00:11:44.162,The press only wants to interview the most ignorant person they can find.
00:11:44.319,00:11:50.001,"I'm on TV! Oh, shit! First Cops, now this! Oh, man, I'mma be a star, son!"
00:11:50.208,00:11:51.711,What can you tell us about Drew?
00:11:52.212,00:11:56.132,"Well, she had the fat ass, son. I mean, it was like bang!"
00:11:56.299,00:11:57.842,How close were you to the victim?
00:11:58.009,00:12:00.595,Real close. Until the roofies wore off.
00:12:00.720,00:12:02.722,Then she woke up talking about pressing charges.
00:12:02.889,00:12:04.807,So I just pulled my tongue outta her ass and left.
00:12:05.023,00:12:06.935,What would have been your last words to Drew?
00:12:07.685,00:12:10.188,"Run, bitch! Run!"
00:12:13.441,00:12:16.194,"Hey, yo, dawg. Does this shirt make me look gay?"
00:12:20.740,00:12:21.866,What about now?
00:12:25.787,00:12:28.039,"Here. Take one, guys. Don't forget, election's Tuesday."
00:12:30.250,00:12:34.295,Ah! Goddam it! Son of a bitch!
00:12:35.588,00:12:36.589,"What's the matter, honey?"
00:12:45.556,00:12:47.350,"Yeah. I did, huh?"
00:12:51.771,00:12:54.148,"-Hey, has anybody seen Bobby? -Nah."
00:12:54.774,00:12:58.778,You know what? That kid is always late. I don't get it. He lives so close.
00:13:24.304,00:13:28.349,"Damn, girl. Mm, mm, mm. I'd sure like to get in them pants."
00:13:28.558,00:13:29.976,-Really? -Yeah.
00:13:30.351,00:13:31.352,What size are these?
00:13:37.775,00:13:39.027,-How you doing? -Good.
00:13:39.859,00:13:41.446,You guys see all the reporters out there?
00:13:41.571,00:13:42.447,-Yeah. -Yeah.
00:13:42.530,00:13:44.240,Saying that girl Drew Decker got killed last night.
00:13:44.324,00:13:46.743,-I know. -You know what? I think I knew her.
00:13:46.907,00:13:49.370,"-Really? -Yeah, she had a brother named Steve?"
00:13:49.518,00:13:50.418,Yeah.
00:13:50.668,00:13:53.207,"Long hair, pretty little mouth, perfect ass?"
00:13:53.374,00:13:55.877,"-That was her. -Nah, I was talking about Steve."
00:13:56.401,00:13:57.712,Whatever happened to him?
00:13:58.338,00:14:06.888,"Hey, go you guys think it's strange that she got killed exactly one year after we… you know, killed that guy?"
00:14:07.138,00:14:09.515,"Hey, Cindy, that was an accident."
00:14:09.599,00:14:10.767,"Was it, Greg?"
00:14:29.118,00:14:32.789,"Would you look at what they're doing? When are we gonna do stuff like that, huh?"
00:14:34.040,00:14:35.083,One day.
00:14:36.167,00:14:38.669,"-You like that, baby? -Yeah. Yeah, that's different."
00:14:38.753,00:14:40.380,"-You like that? -Oh, I love that."
00:14:41.255,00:14:43.132,"Oh, I love when you play with my ass."
00:14:43.716,00:14:45.051,I'm not playing with your ass.
00:14:48.012,00:14:50.223,"-Ray! -Oh, my bad."
00:14:53.267,00:14:55.353,"Hey, Bobby, put on some music."
00:14:56.854,00:14:58.439,"Hold on. Here, put this on."
00:15:03.069,00:15:06.280,"Oh, yeah, that's the shit, right here! Woo!"
00:15:22.338,00:15:24.715,Yeah! Woo!
00:15:38.104,00:15:42.900,-What? It was laundry day. -What the fuck is… Yeah!
00:15:43.776,00:15:49.323,Woo! Yeah!
00:15:50.491,00:15:53.661,"-Hey, come over here. -What?"
00:15:53.911,00:15:56.622,-Just get a little closer to me. -Something you wanna tell me?
00:16:00.626,00:16:02.587,I just want you to touch it. Just touch it. Come on.
00:16:03.337,00:16:05.465,-Uh… -Just a little bit. Come on.
00:16:10.136,00:16:11.179,Ow!
00:16:11.304,00:16:14.223,"Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about."
00:16:27.904,00:16:31.324,"God, Cindy-- Oh, shit!"
00:16:42.835,00:16:46.547,"-Oh, my God. What was that? -I think we hit something."
00:16:51.677,00:16:53.596,"Oh, man!"
00:16:54.847,00:16:58.142,"Bobby, look at my car, man! My dad's gonna freak!"
00:17:01.270,00:17:02.730,"Oh, my God, we hit a boot."
00:17:03.022,00:17:04.857,-Where's the foot? -I don't know.
00:17:06.567,00:17:14.283,"Where the… -Oh, shit, is he alive? -I don't know."
00:17:16.244,00:17:17.620,-Shit! -Dear God!
00:17:17.703,00:17:19.163,We have to call the police.
00:17:19.247,00:17:21.707,-No way. I ain't going to jail. -We have to!
00:17:21.791,00:17:24.502,"Hey, Cindy, do you know what they do to young boys in prison?"
00:17:25.002,00:17:28.047,And all those sex-starved convicts just waiting for a fresh piece of meat.
00:17:28.814,00:17:31.050,"Hey, you're right, Cindy. Maybe we should call the police."
00:17:33.761,00:17:35.096,You think she wants to go to jail?
00:17:35.179,00:17:37.723,"This is manslaughter, okay? We're all gonna fry for this."
00:17:44.855,00:17:45.773,I'm fine.
00:17:47.692,00:17:49.569,"Look, we'll-- We'll get rid of the body."
00:17:56.826,00:17:58.703,-What about the alcohol? -We'll get rid of it.
00:18:03.416,00:18:05.251,I won't have anything to do with this!
00:18:07.837,00:18:09.380,We'll just pretend it never happened.
00:18:09.589,00:18:12.174,"You know, like the time we got drunk and we went down on each other."
00:18:14.969,00:18:15.970,I'll grab his ass.
00:18:16.676,00:18:19.162,We'll take him down to Williamson Cove and we'll dump him in there.
00:18:19.307,00:18:20.838,The sharks'll take care of the evidence.
00:18:22.098,00:18:23.436,"Oh, my God, someone's coming."
00:18:34.322,00:18:36.949,"Shorty, I know you ain't driving without no papers."
00:18:37.116,00:18:42.663,"I got papers, blunts, bongs, all the ingredients to make a high nigga pie."
00:18:44.874,00:18:47.627,"-Hey, yo, can I help you? -Yo, what's up, Ray?"
00:18:48.294,00:18:49.754,"Yo, son, y'all need jumper cables?"
00:18:51.881,00:18:53.588,'Cause I left my roach clip at home.
00:18:55.134,00:18:58.262,"-Go home, Shorty. -Yeah, I'll see you later."
00:18:58.846,00:18:59.847,"Peace, Ray."
00:19:29.877,00:19:32.463,"Hold on, hold on. Put him down. He's heavy. Oh, God."
00:19:33.881,00:19:34.882,Jesus.
00:19:38.803,00:19:41.060,"Wait, wait, wait. Shouldn't we at least check his wallet?"
00:19:41.472,00:19:44.272,"-For what? -Shit, he might have some money."
00:19:45.300,00:19:47.978,We already committed murder. We might as well rob his ass.
00:19:48.104,00:19:49.772,-I'll take the credit cards. -I want the jewelry.
00:19:49.897,00:19:51.148,I'm gonna take his drawers.
00:19:52.316,00:19:55.986,"Get off! Hey, yo, get off! Hey, yo, his drawers are mine! Hey, yo!"
00:19:57.446,00:19:59.740,"-Ooh, I got me a gold ring. -Credit cards."
00:20:02.117,00:20:03.369,"I don't think I can, Greg."
00:20:03.619,00:20:05.913,"-It's not too late. -Shut up, okay?"
00:20:06.053,00:20:07.581,"Christ, already. I'll do it."
00:20:19.802,00:20:23.431,"Right now, we make a pact. We take this to our grave. Agreed?"
00:20:27.143,00:20:29.770,"Say it, Cindy. Say it!"
00:20:30.195,00:20:32.523,We take this to our grave. Say it!
00:20:34.734,00:20:36.861,"-Say it! -Greg, chill. Come on. You're hurting her."
00:20:39.572,00:20:40.614,Ow.
00:20:40.698,00:20:42.908,And we never mention this again.
00:20:44.744,00:20:46.954,-Mention what? -The guy we just killed.
00:20:47.955,00:20:50.040,"Well, you just mentioned it, Greg."
00:20:50.124,00:20:51.709,Starting now!
00:20:53.544,00:20:56.338,"-Bitch, man. -God, I hate him."
00:20:56.505,00:20:58.132,"It's gonna be okay, baby. It's gonna be okay."
00:20:58.674,00:21:00.801,I promise. Just touch it again.
00:21:05.613,00:21:06.932,"You have to move on, Cindy."
00:21:07.016,00:21:09.268,-That's all behind us now. -Exactly.
00:21:09.418,00:21:11.812,"-It's a coincidence. -Greg's right, Cindy."
00:21:11.896,00:21:14.028,"I mean, what do you think, we're in a horror movie?"
00:21:17.276,00:21:23.157,"I mean, if we were, they'd probably cast some dingbat like Jennifer Love Huge Tits to play me."
00:21:23.372,00:21:27.119,"Yeah, yeah, they-- Or they'd cast people in their late 20s, early 30s to play us."
00:21:30.247,00:21:32.374,"Kenny, get the camera ready. Here, hold my gum."
00:21:35.503,00:21:37.505,"Hi, Sheriff, Sheriff, can I get a statement?"
00:21:40.466,00:21:43.135,Who do I have to screw around here to get a stupid story?
00:21:44.178,00:21:45.846,"Hey! Hey, no running."
00:21:53.771,00:21:54.772,All right!
00:21:56.482,00:21:58.859,"Hi, Gail Hailstorm. Field reporter, Hard Story."
00:21:59.568,00:22:00.986,Special Officer Doofy.
00:22:01.195,00:22:05.032,"Oh, hi, Doofy. Doofy, listen, is there a problem on campus?"
00:22:05.282,00:22:07.409,-No comment. No comment. -Okay. Okay.
00:22:08.285,00:22:11.247,"You know, you look awfully young to be a police officer."
00:22:11.421,00:22:13.791,"-Yeah, I'm 25 and a half years old. -Ooh!"
00:22:21.215,00:22:24.552,Except for the big head and glazed over look in your eyes.
00:22:25.302,00:22:28.472,"-Ooh, is that drool? -Yeah, I forgot to swallow."
00:22:29.139,00:22:30.933,"Don't worry, 'cause I never forget."
00:22:34.144,00:22:36.689,-Would you remind me not to do that again? -Sorry.
00:22:38.404,00:22:42.152,"the sheriff and me, your principal, will be questioning all students throughout the day."
00:22:45.239,00:22:47.700,"Yeah, I'm not supposed to say. It's official police business."
00:22:48.274,00:22:55.040,"Mm. Hey, Doofy, what do you say you and I go inside my van over there and, uh, get to know each other a little better?"
00:22:55.124,00:22:56.709,-Would you like that? -That van?
00:23:02.047,00:23:04.758,"-Yeah, okay, let's go. Come on. -Oh!"
00:23:05.251,00:23:08.888,A terrible tragedy and an unbearable loss.
00:23:09.221,00:23:12.892,It's days like today that we need prayer in school.
00:23:13.559,00:23:17.438,Starts to unravel the very moral fabric of our society.
00:23:18.898,00:23:20.357,"Here you go, baby."
00:23:24.069,00:23:25.154,Oh!
00:23:28.688,00:23:29.825,-Sweet! -All right!
00:23:30.242,00:23:34.371,"Okay, class, who would like to give their oral presentation first?"
00:23:35.331,00:23:36.332,Oh!
00:23:36.916,00:23:38.250,-Anybody? -Yes!
00:23:39.418,00:23:40.461,Anybody else?
00:23:42.838,00:23:44.821,"-Okay, Heather. -Oh! Yes!"
00:23:48.427,00:23:50.429,-Okay. Can I start? -Yeah.
00:23:50.596,00:23:53.265,"Okay, my presentation is on the First Amendment."
00:23:53.933,00:23:58.437,"And it began on May 25th, 1787 in Philly with George Washington."
00:23:58.562,00:25:05.963,"And it states, and I quote, When our Founding Fathers argued the passage of our glorious Constitution… And so, the First Amendment gives us the right to say what we want-- Uh, Cindy Campbell."
00:25:06.630,00:25:25.024,"Isn't she the daughter of, uh, well, you know… -Oh, yeah, old missus, uh… -Old missus… And… Yeah. Yeah, the one and only-- Thanks, Doofy."
00:25:25.315,00:25:27.276,"It's Special Officer Doofy today, Cind."
00:25:28.652,00:25:32.531,"Now, Cindy, the sheriff has some questions that he would like to ask you today."
00:25:32.614,00:25:35.909,-What is that… That god-awful smell? -I don't know.
00:25:36.250,00:25:37.411,I go poopie.
00:25:38.704,00:25:41.623,"Did you just say that you, uh… You went poopie?"
00:25:48.380,00:25:50.466,"-Thank you, Doofy. -Okay."
00:25:51.091,00:25:53.177,You should now go back to special ed.
00:25:53.510,00:25:56.764,"-Okay. Salute. -Maybe a change of underwear, son."
00:25:57.765,00:25:59.683,"-Bye, Doofy. -Bye, Cind."
00:26:06.172,00:26:08.192,Got a boil on my ass the size of a walnut.
00:26:09.874,00:26:12.738,"Cindy, we wanna ask you some questions about Drew Decker."
00:26:14.406,00:26:15.657,I didn't really know her.
00:26:15.889,00:26:17.117,"Oh, come on. Sure you do."
00:26:19.828,00:26:21.080,I've been in this game a long time.
00:26:21.163,00:26:23.499,"Don't bullshit a bullshitter, all right. Tell me about Drew."
00:26:25.066,00:26:27.002,"How-- What was she like in bed, Cindy?"
00:26:32.174,00:26:33.675,It's an old police trick. You didn't fall for it.
00:26:35.511,00:26:36.553,Hike!
00:26:51.235,00:26:53.112,"Johnson, what a block, baby."
00:26:53.278,00:26:56.406,"-Word up. Woodward, nice ass. -Hey."
00:26:57.491,00:26:58.492,Damn.
00:26:59.576,00:27:01.870,"Hey, yo, Greg. Man, what's up? You gonna hit the showers or what?"
00:27:03.288,00:27:05.332,"No, man. I-- I think I'm gonna work out, you know?"
00:27:05.541,00:27:06.583,Beat the bag a little.
00:27:07.292,00:27:08.919,"Suit yourself, kid. All right."
00:27:09.503,00:27:12.422,"Last one in the shower's a rotten egg! Come on, y'all!"
00:27:41.910,00:27:44.997,Who did this? Huh? Where are you?
00:27:46.415,00:27:51.253,"This isn't funny, all right? A small dick's like a disability, man!"
00:27:51.795,00:27:54.173,"Huh? Would you make fun of a guy in a wheelchair, huh?"
00:27:54.548,00:27:58.051,"Would you? Come on out here, you sick fuck!"
00:27:58.468,00:28:00.679,I'll kick the shit out of you right now!
00:28:01.513,00:28:02.514,All right?
00:28:02.848,00:28:06.351,"It's not the size of the hammer, it's the nail you're throwing it at!"
00:28:09.688,00:28:13.108,"It's a shame how she died, you know? She was such a nice girl."
00:28:13.358,00:28:16.028,"Yeah, she used to baby-sit my brother Doofy."
00:28:16.445,00:28:19.239,"-He had the biggest crush on her. -Ray, you're a dead man!"
00:28:20.324,00:28:22.159,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
00:28:22.242,00:28:24.494,"Nah, nah, nah. What you trying to say? You wanna get butt-naked and wrestle?"
00:28:24.578,00:28:25.746,"-Come on. -Bring it on, Ray!"
00:28:25.829,00:28:27.748,"-Hold my earrings. Where's my Vaseline? -Come on, man. Chill out."
00:28:27.915,00:28:30.459,-Take it easy. What's the problem? -I'll show you the problem.
00:28:34.463,00:28:37.507,"They-- They turned the hot water off in the showers, all right?"
00:28:46.558,00:28:48.101,You know what? You can all go to hell!
00:28:49.144,00:28:52.481,"Greg, you're not the only one who got one."
00:28:53.821,00:28:55.943,"Oh, you mean-- You mean Bobby's got a baby dick too?"
00:28:58.534,00:29:02.658,"No, I was talking about the note. I got one too."
00:29:06.577,00:29:08.538,"Look, someone's just trying to fuck with us, you guys."
00:29:08.622,00:29:10.207,"We have to call the police, Greg."
00:29:11.375,00:29:14.044,You call the police and I'll kill you myself.
00:29:23.804,00:29:25.305,That goes for all of you guys.
00:29:25.889,00:29:28.392,"That psycho wants a piece of me, bring it on."
00:29:28.592,00:29:31.353,But I'm not going to jail. You got that?
00:29:39.918,00:29:41.154,What's everybody talking about?
00:29:42.221,00:29:44.121,"Just forget it, Shorty. You already know too much."
00:29:57.629,00:30:00.549,Very good. And contestant number two.
00:30:05.304,00:30:08.098,Very good. And contestant number three.
00:30:11.518,00:30:13.228,That's my girlfriend!
00:30:15.147,00:30:16.690,"Hey, kiss my ass!"
00:30:18.525,00:30:21.069,"-All right, Buffy! -Hey, shut the hell up, man!"
00:30:23.512,00:30:24.740,"What, you want a piece of me?"
00:30:24.823,00:30:26.992,"Now, the talent portion of the competition."
00:30:27.183,00:30:29.745,"Oh, you guys, I'm gonna go downstairs for a closer seat."
00:30:29.828,00:30:31.076,-See you after the show. -Okay.
00:30:34.750,00:30:37.210,"Hey, man, I'm gonna go hit the head. You want me to bring you back anything?"
00:30:37.336,00:30:39.852,"No, no, no. I'm good, man. But hurry back. She's gonna perform."
00:30:42.799,00:30:44.815,And what will be your talent for this evening?
00:30:45.594,00:30:48.513,Acting. I'll be doing a dramatic reading.
00:30:55.395,00:30:58.630,"Hey, do that thing from Baywatch! She's running down the beach!"
00:31:05.596,00:31:07.616,"Look out, Greg! Look behind you!"
00:31:09.242,00:31:11.953,-It's him! It's the killer! -Huh?
00:31:12.204,00:31:15.040,"Oh, my-- Somebody do something!"
00:31:21.755,00:31:23.799,-He's killing him! -Must be an original piece.
00:31:27.803,00:31:29.513,She's good. She's good.
00:31:29.888,00:31:32.474,-What's wrong with you people? -That's fantastic.
00:31:32.808,00:31:36.645,You fucking bastards! Why won't anyone help?
00:31:38.761,00:31:41.942,"Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God! No!"
00:31:47.364,00:31:50.909,Give it up for Buffy Gilmore! Wonderful. Absolutely fantastic.
00:31:54.979,00:31:56.915,"I think we have a winner, ladies and gentlemen."
00:31:57.791,00:31:59.126,Miss Buffy Gilmore!
00:31:59.251,00:32:01.711,"Buffy, wait. You have to go back on stage."
00:32:01.837,00:32:04.131,"-No, I have to get to Greg. -But you won!"
00:32:04.214,00:32:09.719,-They're calling your name. -There's a killer… -I won? -They're calling your name. Go.
00:32:09.803,00:32:11.388,"Buffy, what happened? What about Greg?"
00:32:11.513,00:32:13.765,"-Oh, fuck Greg. I won! -Congratulations!"
00:32:13.849,00:32:15.058,"Oh, out of my way, loser!"
00:32:15.142,00:32:18.228,Miss Buffy Gilmore!
00:32:45.505,00:32:49.926,"There's no sign of him anywhere. I don't-- -He could've taken the body. -That's impossible, Cindy."
00:32:50.010,00:32:52.095,There's no blood. There's nothing. Look around.
00:32:52.179,00:32:55.056,I bet it's just Greg playing another one of his dumb jokes.
00:32:55.182,00:32:56.766,He's gonna turn up. I'm sure of it.
00:32:56.933,00:32:59.383,"He's probably at my house waiting for us right now, you guys."
00:33:00.145,00:33:06.109,"All right, fine. Fine. But you know what, I'm gonna look around some more, so… -You mind catching a ride home with Buffy? -Yeah, no problem."
00:33:06.193,00:33:08.069,"-All right, fine. -Call me later."
00:33:36.104,00:33:37.224,"You know, your boyfriend."
00:33:46.274,00:33:48.360,-Do you want me to come by? -No.
00:33:55.909,00:33:59.996,"-I love you. -Aw. I love you too, baby."
00:34:23.228,00:34:53.550,"Bobby, I told you-- -I'm gonna slice you up. -Who is this?"
00:34:59.389,00:35:00.599,Do you know where I am?
00:35:03.700,00:35:06.813,"I could be anywhere. I'm like the wind, baby."
00:35:07.689,00:35:10.442,Yeah. Where am I?
00:35:13.328,00:35:15.989,"Um, you're-- You're behind the couch."
00:35:19.784,00:35:21.703,"I can, um, see your feet."
00:35:34.174,00:35:36.217,"Yeah. No. No, no."
00:35:38.219,00:35:39.721,"Hey, no peeking. No peeking. Turn around."
00:35:41.222,00:35:43.975,"Good. Okay, now you can look."
00:35:49.022,00:35:52.067,"No, Mr. Killer. I don't know where you are."
00:36:51.668,00:36:53.169,"-Are you okay? -Oh, my God."
00:36:53.253,00:36:54.618,I heard screaming. What's going on?
00:36:54.879,00:36:57.090,"-Bobby, he was here. -Shh."
00:36:57.173,00:36:58.842,"The killer was here, Bobby."
00:36:59.592,00:37:00.593,It's okay.
00:37:07.851,00:37:10.186,"-I can explain that. -Oh, my God."
00:37:11.496,00:37:14.232,A friend gave 'em to me. Cindy. Cindy.
00:37:17.152,00:37:19.821,Cindy! Cindy! Cindy!
00:37:26.827,00:37:28.955,"Cindy, you know me. Cindy."
00:37:36.129,00:37:38.506,"I know you've had a rough night, Cindy, so I won't keep you."
00:37:38.631,00:37:41.100,I just want you to look at some photos. Tell me what you think.
00:37:54.654,00:37:57.984,"-I'm sorry, Sheriff. -You sure?"
00:37:58.943,00:38:01.571,"Okay, you're free to go. Do you have somebody picking you up?"
00:38:02.071,00:38:06.910,"-Yeah. -Oh, just… Check that one out again."
00:38:08.885,00:38:10.789,"-Mm, no. -No? No? All right."
00:38:10.872,00:38:12.707,"Well, worth a shot. All right, thanks."
00:38:13.955,00:38:15.960,Guess what I just did with those hookers we busted.
00:38:16.085,00:38:17.879,"-No way. -All the way, man!"
00:38:17.962,00:38:20.381,"Yes, yes. Watch this, watch this. Doofy!"
00:38:22.425,00:38:23.426,Okay.
00:38:24.969,00:38:26.763,Special Officer Doofy reporting.
00:38:31.935,00:38:34.145,"That's when you know you've become a man, Doofy!"
00:38:35.396,00:38:37.232,"Hey, Terry, smell my finger."
00:38:40.109,00:38:43.905,"-Get the hell out of here, Doofy. -Doofy, Mom said get home now."
00:38:44.864,00:38:47.200,Tell Mom I'm on official police business.
00:38:47.283,00:38:49.160,"-Hey, Cindy, are you okay? -Hey, hey, hey."
00:38:49.369,00:38:50.995,No talking to the witness.
00:38:51.145,00:38:53.206,"Go get in the car, Doofy. She's coming with us."
00:38:53.289,00:38:55.208,"-Does Mom know? -Yeah, Doofus."
00:38:55.357,00:38:59.212,"Mom says when I wear this badge, you're supposed to treat me like a man of the law."
00:38:59.504,00:39:02.549,"Yeah, well, Mom also said for you to stop sticking your dick in the vacuum cleaner."
00:39:06.344,00:39:16.104,"Okay, three, two-- No, it's just that there's all these numbers with decima-- Here, let me make it easy for you. Chubzilla, listen up. Okay?"
00:39:16.253,00:39:17.936,-This little piggy went to the market. -All right.
00:39:18.061,00:39:19.566,All right? This little piggy stayed home.
00:39:19.732,00:39:29.080,"Now, if this little piggy doesn't roll the goddam camera, I'm gonna put my foot up his fuckin' ass-- Gail Hailstorm standing out in front of the police station where I'm going to try and get a glimpse of Cindy Campbell."
00:39:29.242,00:39:31.619,The young girl who was attacked earlier this evening.
00:39:35.053,00:39:36.585,-What did I say? -Don't ever step on Gail's shoes.
00:39:38.376,00:39:40.025,-You idiot. -I'm a-- I'm a bad man.
00:39:43.578,00:39:45.631,"Buffy Gilmore, Miss Teen. She's not talking."
00:39:47.886,00:39:50.597,"-Um, come on, Cindy. -Cindy, Cindy, your ass looks fat!"
00:39:55.435,00:39:56.686,-Good shot. -Come on.
00:40:00.815,00:40:03.026,"-Oh, my God. -It was an accident, Gail."
00:40:04.151,00:40:06.176,I only touched the-- The top of the breast.
00:40:07.238,00:40:08.948,-It was so tender and juicy. You know-- -Shut up!
00:40:22.253,00:40:23.296,Nothin'.
00:40:23.588,00:40:26.633,Sittin' here watchin' the game. Smokin' some bud.
00:40:30.803,00:40:34.390,-Wassup? -Wassup?
00:40:36.851,00:40:38.144,"Yo, pick up the phone."
00:40:45.026,00:40:47.236,"Yo, Dookie, pick up the phone!"
00:40:48.404,00:40:49.447,Yo.
00:41:05.838,00:41:07.090,True. True.
00:41:08.948,00:41:10.134,"So, you think Bobby did it?"
00:41:13.763,00:41:16.849,"I don't know. But he was there, Buffy."
00:41:17.558,00:41:20.645,I knew there had to be something. He's just too perfect.
00:41:21.396,00:41:24.273,"Handsome, smart, good in bed."
00:41:25.650,00:41:31.781,-What did you say? -Uh-- Got you an ice pack for your hand.
00:41:32.448,00:41:34.617,-Ow! -Sorry.
00:41:38.037,00:41:39.956,"No, no, that's okay, Doofy."
00:41:40.289,00:41:44.335,"Hey, we're gonna get that guy you dumped in the water. Yeah."
00:41:45.253,00:41:48.631,"I'll be next door if you need me. Night, Cind."
00:41:50.240,00:41:51.676,"Buffy, you told him?"
00:41:51.843,00:41:54.846,The moron overheard a conversation Greg and I were having.
00:41:54.929,00:41:56.681,"Yeah, but what if he says something?"
00:41:56.764,00:42:00.143,Who's gonna believe a retarded retard like him anyway? Don't worry.
00:42:01.310,00:42:02.645,"Cindy, telephone."
00:42:06.983,00:42:07.984,Hello.
00:42:29.005,00:42:30.006,Hello?
00:42:32.091,00:42:33.092,Hello?
00:42:34.469,00:42:37.680,I said don't disturb me while I'm cleaning my room!
00:42:44.270,00:42:45.646,I heard Bobby got out this morning.
00:42:46.773,00:42:49.025,I haven't seen him around. Is he pissed?
00:42:50.234,00:42:52.028,You mean since you branded him the Candyman?
00:42:52.195,00:42:53.571,"No, his heart is broken."
00:42:54.030,00:42:56.949,"Yo, son. It's like I seen this all before."
00:42:57.200,00:42:59.118,"They had a killer at your old high school, Shorty?"
00:42:59.285,00:43:01.079,"Nah, it was in this movie Scream."
00:43:01.162,00:43:03.456,Same dialogue and everything. This is ill.
00:43:03.915,00:43:05.541,-How did it end? -I don't know.
00:43:05.625,00:43:08.461,"Some nigga started shooting up in the movie theater, so we just broke out."
00:43:09.504,00:43:11.005,-No doubt. -Okay.
00:43:11.214,00:43:14.717,"I say we all just stick together. Tonight, everyone meet at my house."
00:43:15.134,00:43:17.637,"And bring some friends. But don't tell everyone, okay?"
00:43:17.762,00:43:19.263,-Try to keep it quiet. -Okay.
00:43:20.181,00:43:25.144,Yo! Party at Cindy's house! Drunk white women for everybody!
00:43:27.188,00:43:31.109,"Ray, if you see Bobby, tell him I love him."
00:43:32.235,00:43:35.571,"Okay. If I see Bobby, I'll tell him I love him."
00:43:43.121,00:43:44.455,-Jesus! -It's okay. It's all right.
00:43:46.664,00:43:48.264,"What, you don't still think it's me, do you?"
00:43:48.668,00:43:50.600,"No, it's just that somebody did try to kill me."
00:43:50.878,00:43:52.296,"Yeah, and the police said I scared him away."
00:43:52.672,00:43:54.924,I know. He called me last night.
00:43:55.299,00:43:57.974,"Yes, you see, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail last night, remember?"
00:44:03.090,00:44:05.434,I'm sorry. Please understand.
00:44:05.607,00:44:08.396,Understand what? That my girlfriend would rather call me a killer than touch me?
00:44:08.536,00:44:10.189,"-That's not true, Bobby. -Then what is it?"
00:44:10.273,00:44:12.942,What is it? She's gone and she's not coming back.
00:44:13.107,00:44:14.735,"It's been over a year, Cindy."
00:44:14.852,00:44:17.446,But Ginger was such an important part of the Spice Girls.
00:44:17.554,00:44:19.740,"-Oh, you gotta move on, baby. -Oh!"
00:44:20.825,00:44:27.039,I'm sorry if my complicated life is an inconvenience to your perfect existence.
00:44:27.874,00:44:30.084,Cindy. Cind.
00:44:33.254,00:44:41.554,"Let me just say, uh, the killing of these-- These teenagers has been tragic, but, uh… Hey, you know, shit happens."
00:44:45.349,00:44:46.601,"Yes, Miss Thunderstorm."
00:44:46.750,00:44:48.561,Have they found Cindy Campbell's father?
00:44:49.020,00:44:50.688,-No. -Isn't he a suspect?
00:44:50.855,00:44:52.982,That is classified information. Where are you getting that?
00:44:53.649,00:44:56.766,"I'm sorry, but my sources are strictly confidential, Sheriff."
00:44:57.153,00:44:58.154,"Hey, Gail."
00:44:59.488,00:45:00.531,Gail swallows.
00:45:08.748,00:45:09.832,Watch this.
00:45:11.584,00:45:14.462,Hello. Who is this?
00:45:19.467,00:45:23.262,"Oh, God. Hold on. Cindy, it's for you."
00:45:28.267,00:45:30.266,"All right, knock it off, Buffy."
00:45:30.519,00:45:36.150,"Now, as you all have heard, there is a killer in our town and the police have asked us to give you the following safety tips."
00:45:37.109,00:45:41.072,"Stay in well-lit areas. Do not travel alone, whenever possible."
00:45:42.031,00:45:43.449,Always wipe front to back.
00:45:44.116,00:45:51.290,"And remember, never, ever believe someone when they tell you that shaving your pubic hair will rid you of crab infestation."
00:45:52.875,00:45:56.545,"Now, I understand this is a difficult time for you young ladies."
00:45:57.338,00:46:01.342,"So, if anyone needs to come to my office to talk, I'm here for you."
00:46:06.305,00:46:07.515,What a crock of shit.
00:46:07.640,00:46:10.393,"It's not, Buffy! He's real!"
00:46:21.988,00:46:23.155,Miss Mann?
00:46:25.408,00:46:28.494,"Come in, dear. Have a seat. Take off your bra, if you'd like."
00:46:30.705,00:46:31.872,"No, thanks."
00:46:33.749,00:46:35.042,"What can I do for you, Cindy?"
00:46:35.751,00:46:41.173,"I need to talk. See, I have this problem and I don't know who to tell."
00:46:43.134,00:46:44.343,Not feeling so fresh?
00:46:45.011,00:46:46.012,Huh?
00:46:46.336,00:46:48.222,Feminine odor and itching got you down?
00:46:52.310,00:46:53.311,Then what is it?
00:46:56.022,00:46:57.606,I have a terrible secret.
00:46:58.899,00:47:01.402,"Well, Cindy, we all have our little secrets."
00:47:04.655,00:47:06.866,Sometimes we do things we're not so proud of.
00:47:07.575,00:47:08.617,Some for money.
00:47:10.286,00:47:12.663,Others to gain the athletic edge on the competition.
00:47:13.873,00:47:15.708,Sometimes those secrets come back to haunt us.
00:47:17.376,00:47:18.586,Do you know what I mean?
00:47:23.132,00:47:26.010,"I mean, all your help. I have to go to class."
00:47:27.720,00:47:28.763,"Anytime, dear."
00:47:32.308,00:47:34.977,"-Buffy, are you coming? -I'll catch up with you guys in a sec."
00:47:44.779,00:47:45.780,Hello?
00:47:53.829,00:47:54.955,Somebody there?
00:47:56.832,00:47:58.000,Hello!
00:48:06.258,00:48:10.346,Who put you up to this? Cindy? Lose the cape. It's way too '90s horror.
00:48:13.224,00:48:17.144,"Oh, so what movie is this from, Die, Cheerleader, Die?"
00:48:19.387,00:48:20.898,Wanna play psycho killer?
00:48:22.233,00:48:24.235,Can I be the helpless cheerleader?
00:48:26.278,00:48:29.198,"Oh, so is this where I'm supposed to beg for my life?"
00:48:30.157,00:48:32.743,"Please, Mr. Killer, don't kill me."
00:48:37.206,00:48:39.250,"So, is this where I'm supposed to bleed?"
00:48:53.347,00:48:57.852,"Help! Oh, now I'm gonna fall and break my leg, leaving me helpless."
00:49:01.814,00:49:04.942,"There you go, Mr. Scary Killer. I'm panicking now."
00:49:05.651,00:49:09.530,"Oh, God! Somebody please help me!"
00:49:14.535,00:49:15.578,"Oh, now what?"
00:49:16.328,00:49:18.747,"Ooh, I guess this is the big climax."
00:49:26.005,00:49:28.048,"Oh, look at me. I'm all dead."
00:49:28.132,00:49:31.469,"I'm a gross, scary severed head. Come on. Please."
00:49:31.886,00:49:35.556,Do you know who I am? I'm Miss Teen. You're really giving me a headache.
00:49:35.655,00:49:38.100,And you got blood all over my Gucci sweater.
00:49:38.184,00:49:39.435,I hope you're gonna pay for that.
00:49:43.105,00:49:44.899,I'm gonna jump!
00:49:45.065,00:49:47.193,"Phil, get back in there."
00:49:49.360,00:49:50.415,Be reasonable.
00:49:53.199,00:49:56.243,or those greasy shithead teenagers anymore!
00:49:56.452,00:49:57.995,I'm gonna end it all!
00:50:01.749,00:50:04.210,"Now we know Bobby's not the killer. So, who is?"
00:50:04.376,00:50:05.377,I don't know.
00:50:05.669,00:50:08.672,"Well, if the killer was in your house last night, why didn't he just kill you then?"
00:50:08.796,00:50:10.716,Because he's just messing with us.
00:50:10.883,00:50:13.177,Don't you see? He's got us right where he wants us.
00:50:13.594,00:50:14.845,We can't go to the police.
00:50:15.012,00:50:18.015,He's just out there watching us and waiting for us.
00:50:18.673,00:50:20.643,"What are you waiting for, huh?"
00:50:22.186,00:50:24.146,What are you waiting for?
00:50:25.064,00:50:26.774,What are you waiting for?
00:50:29.755,00:50:31.145,What am I waiting for?
00:50:39.537,00:50:41.914,"Ray, I still don't think this party is a good idea."
00:50:42.155,00:50:43.832,You know I'm not gonna let nothin' happen to you.
00:50:43.914,00:50:47.461,I just don't feel right. Why can't we just do something else?
00:50:47.894,00:50:49.463,"Okay, how about we go to the movies?"
00:50:50.381,00:50:52.007,-Huh? You like that? -Yes.
00:51:00.280,00:51:01.976,"You know they gave me a shout-out on the album, right?"
00:51:10.150,00:51:12.208,Did I tell you how sexy you look in my jersey?
00:51:15.698,00:51:18.367,"I like it. Hey, get up. Go-- Go over there. Let me see it."
00:51:27.167,00:51:29.378,-You like that? You like that? -Yeah. Hey!
00:51:35.050,00:51:36.844,"That's right. You know I'm freaky, girl."
00:51:38.762,00:51:42.182,"-Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah! -Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh."
00:51:43.601,00:51:45.185,"Yeah. Here, put this on with it."
00:51:46.645,00:51:47.646,Go on.
00:51:48.856,00:51:49.898,Are you sure?
00:51:50.190,00:51:53.277,"Go on, girl. Go on. Pull it on."
00:51:57.990,00:51:59.366,I like that look.
00:52:02.701,00:52:03.951,"Here, put this on with it."
00:52:05.963,00:52:07.249,"Go on, girl. Put it on."
00:52:08.667,00:52:11.337,"Yeah, put that shit on there. Come on. Just shove it on."
00:52:11.754,00:52:15.341,"Do it. Yeah. Ooh, so fucking sexy."
00:52:15.490,00:52:18.010,"Come here, girl. Bring your little sexy ass over here. Come on!"
00:52:18.093,00:52:19.762,Full speed. Charge!
00:52:23.766,00:52:26.101,-Yes! Yes! Come on! Turn around! -Ooh!
00:52:26.185,00:52:28.687,"Turn around! Come on! Yes, Brendan!"
00:52:28.771,00:52:30.856,"-Take it, Brendan! Take it, Brendan! -Who?"
00:52:31.440,00:52:33.067,"Uh… Uh, Brenda. Come on, come on."
00:52:33.150,00:52:36.654,"Put the helmet on. No, let's role-play. Come on. You get me. Get me."
00:52:36.987,00:52:38.405,-Come on! Come on! -Huh?
00:52:38.523,00:52:45.788,"I'm here at Lover's Lookout. It's dark, it's in the middle of nowhere, and it's where hormone-driven teens love to come and fool around."
00:52:46.372,00:52:48.916,"So, very likely, we're about to see someone get killed."
00:52:49.625,00:52:53.462,"Okay, sure enough, there's a girl in that car, blouse unbuttoned, all alone."
00:52:53.587,00:52:55.089,Let's see if she'll have a word with us.
00:52:56.340,00:52:59.677,"Hi, Gail Hailstorm, author of the new book, You're Next."
00:53:03.514,00:53:04.640,"Well, my name's Heather."
00:53:04.723,00:53:07.101,"Heather, can you tell us what you're doing out here all alone?"
00:53:07.893,00:53:09.395,"Well, yeah, sure."
00:53:09.478,00:53:17.692,"My boyfriend and I were just, like, making out and then we heard a noise out there, so he went to go check it, but… Yeah, yeah."
00:53:17.778,00:53:22.783,"Heather, has it crossed your little mind that your boyfriend was probably murdered and you're about to be slaughtered next?"
00:53:28.122,00:53:30.290,"-Heather, good luck. -Okay, thanks, Gail. You're the best."
00:53:32.334,00:53:34.712,The murder is happening as we speak.
00:53:34.795,00:53:37.423,I'm gonna try and break into the bloodshed. Are you getting this?
00:53:37.506,00:53:41.093,"Excuse me. Heather, Heather, can you tell us what you're feeling, honey?"
00:53:41.176,00:53:44.930,"Lots of pain. Gail, please help me. Gail, please!"
00:53:45.055,00:53:46.932,"I'd like to help you out, kid, but it's sweeps."
00:53:47.015,00:53:51.979,"Sir, sir, can I get a word with you? Sir-- I'm just trying to do my job."
00:53:52.104,00:53:53.897,"-Get the camera off me now! -No, Kenny, keep rolling!"
00:53:56.547,00:53:58.658,…and shove it up his ass. Get-- Get that camera off me!
00:54:03.991,00:54:06.702,"Kenny! Oh, my God, he's right behind you!"

00:58:43.979,00:58:45.772,Will you sit down.
00:58:49.317,00:58:51.028,Your ass is grass.
00:58:55.240,00:58:57.534,-This is for Thelma! -And Louise!
00:58:57.617,00:59:00.078,This is for talking through The Fugitive!
00:59:00.370,00:59:03.457,-You ruined Schindler's List. -All Jackie Chan movies.
00:59:03.540,00:59:07.169,-Boogie Nights! -And Big Momma's House!
00:59:30.650,00:59:34.446,"Um, you guys, there's a-- There's a few too many people."
00:59:34.571,00:59:37.491,"Oh, honey, please don't throw-- No, hey, you guys, stop."
00:59:37.908,00:59:40.118,"Hey! Hey, please! That's my dad's!"
00:59:41.558,00:59:42.654,Do you have more beer?
00:59:42.788,00:59:45.999,"-Do you have more beer? -Um, yeah. Uh, check in the garage."
01:00:17.280,01:00:20.867,"Horsey. Oh, you scared me too."
01:00:25.330,01:00:27.958,Hello? Who's there?
01:00:52.107,01:00:53.150,"Oh, my God."
01:01:34.149,01:01:37.944,"Oh, Bobby. Bobby. I was worried about you."
01:01:38.653,01:01:41.072,I thought the killer got to you before I could.
01:01:43.992,01:01:46.620,I wanna go upstairs. There's something I wanna show you.
01:02:09.226,01:02:14.356,"And, you know, if you're not ready… I'll understand."
01:02:16.191,01:02:19.069,Bobby… I am ready.
01:02:21.154,01:02:23.073,-You are? -Yeah.
01:02:25.325,01:02:28.411,I can't keep fighting these urges.
01:02:29.704,01:02:34.156,I have to just give in to them and let them flow.
01:02:34.281,01:02:35.210,Right.
01:02:37.295,01:02:38.546,-Bobby? -Huh?
01:02:38.964,01:02:40.924,I have been so selfish.
01:02:43.885,01:02:45.929,This is like a scene from a movie or something.
01:02:46.596,01:02:50.517,"Only it isn't a movie, Bobby. This is real life."
01:02:52.435,01:02:53.687,"It's all a movie, baby."
01:02:54.938,01:02:57.565,There's the sound guy. There's the script supervisor.
01:02:58.900,01:03:00.068,-Bobby? -What?
01:03:01.611,01:03:08.921,What I mean is that in real life you have to enjoy each moment.
01:03:09.021,01:03:09.891,Yeah.
01:03:32.809,01:03:34.811,Mm! Ow!
01:03:43.820,01:03:45.071,Can I tell you a secret?
01:03:49.617,01:03:51.411,I see dead people.
01:03:56.390,01:03:58.877,"Yo, son, we gotta roll some more of that shit!"
01:04:03.715,01:04:05.425,We don't have any more papers.
01:04:16.895,01:04:19.481,Yeah!
01:04:24.778,01:04:27.614,"Oh, shit, son!"
01:05:00.772,01:05:02.023,-Bobby! -What?
01:05:02.322,01:05:03.566,I've never done this before.
01:05:05.193,01:05:28.425,"It's okay. It's okay. It's just like… Just like that. Just like that, baby."
01:05:33.513,01:05:35.723,"Oh, Jesus!"
01:05:37.508,01:05:40.019,I never could wait to get to the chewy middle.
01:05:43.815,01:05:44.941,Goddamn.
01:06:40.580,01:06:44.209,"Oh, yeah. Oh, Bobby!"
01:06:47.587,01:06:50.173,"Come here, Bobby! I want it now!"
01:07:16.950,01:07:19.369,What's your favorite scary movie?
01:07:27.752,01:07:29.629,I'm gonna gut you like a pig!
01:07:36.886,01:07:42.267,"Oh, yeah! Oh! Yeah! What's my name, Bobby?"
01:07:44.060,01:07:47.647,"-What's my name, bitch? -Ow! God! It's Cindy!"
01:07:47.897,01:07:50.775,"Whose is it, Bobby? Whose is it, Bobby?"
01:08:03.538,01:08:06.332,"Oh, shit!"
01:08:47.999,01:08:49.125,Peace!
01:08:51.628,01:08:52.670,Yo.
01:09:00.386,01:09:03.931,Bobby… where were you tonight?
01:09:05.183,01:09:08.144,-What? -I was just curious.
01:09:08.978,01:09:10.271,What took you so long to get here?
01:09:10.730,01:09:11.773,Why you so curious?
01:09:13.941,01:09:14.942,I don't know.
01:09:15.985,01:09:20.823,I thought it would fit the '90s horror cliché if you turned out to be the killer.
01:09:25.912,01:09:27.205,Buffy and Greg are dead?
01:09:31.459,01:09:33.586,"Bobby, turn around! It's the killer!"
01:09:59.529,01:10:00.822,"It's gonna be okay, Bobby."
01:10:03.491,01:10:06.369,"Yo, wait for me! There's a killer in the house!"
01:10:06.494,01:10:08.579,"There's ass, blood and guts everywhere!"
01:10:08.788,01:10:10.581,"Someone done gone crazy, son!"
01:10:14.502,01:10:15.586,"Bobby, no!"
01:10:24.095,01:10:26.347,"Cindy, he shot me in the lungs."
01:10:34.814,01:10:35.857,Ketchup.
01:10:36.899,01:10:39.026,"Just like my mom puts on her spaghetti, baby."
01:10:41.362,01:10:43.865,"Oh, my God! Ray, you've gotta help me! Bobby's gone crazy!"
01:11:02.883,01:11:04.844,"Why are you doing this, Bobby?"
01:11:05.025,01:11:06.888,Why? Why?
01:11:07.972,01:11:10.016,"Hear that, Ray? I think she wants a motive."
01:11:11.434,01:11:13.561,-Did Scream have a plot? -No.
01:11:16.981,01:11:19.692,Don't think so! What about the sequel?
01:11:19.833,01:11:21.402,"What the hell was with that fat, white Jamaican kid?"
01:11:21.486,01:11:23.237,"-Oh, I wanna kill that motherfucker. -Me too, man."
01:11:23.404,01:11:25.239,"It was bad casting, Bobby."
01:11:25.865,01:11:30.912,How about this for a motive? Lack of sex! It can cause serious deviant behavior.
01:11:31.794,01:11:33.372,I thought you loved me.
01:11:33.995,01:11:35.333,"Oh, I did, baby."
01:11:35.455,01:11:39.337,"I did, but abstinence can make you discover new things about yourself."
01:11:39.837,01:11:41.798,"That's right, Cindy. I'm gay."
01:11:42.548,01:11:44.842,"And in case you haven't noticed, so is Ray."
01:11:46.552,01:11:48.638,What? I ain't gay.
01:11:48.895,01:11:50.577,What are you talking about? You took me to that club.
01:11:50.727,01:11:52.141,"So, they play good music."
01:11:53.273,01:11:54.977,What about our trip to San Francisco then?
01:11:55.143,01:11:56.562,I wanted to go shopping.
01:11:58.231,01:12:03.986,"-But you made love to me. -No. First of all, you sucked my-- Whatever, Ray! Okay, I don't want to talk about this now."
01:12:04.111,01:12:08.407,"The point is, Cindy, that I'm a new man and I'm ready to leave all this behind and start a new life."
01:12:09.367,01:12:13.788,"-So, you killed all your friends? -Oh, no. Just you."
01:12:14.622,01:12:17.041,"And maybe Shorty, but that wasn't planned or anything."
01:12:17.182,01:12:18.793,But here's the genius part.
01:12:19.502,01:12:22.755,We're copycatting a serial killer that already exists.
01:12:23.047,01:12:24.215,"It's the perfect crime, Cindy."
01:12:24.423,01:12:26.884,But wait! There's more!
01:12:27.552,01:12:31.347,"Hang on to your seat, baby, 'cause this one's a screamer!"
01:12:32.431,01:12:34.976,-I'll be back. -Uh-oh.
01:12:36.102,01:12:37.895,Move your big ass. Come on.
01:12:40.697,01:12:42.650,"What are you gonna do, frame him?"
01:12:43.359,01:12:46.487,Nah. We're just having a little bit of fun with old daddio.
01:12:48.322,01:12:53.661,"The police are gonna find you and Daddy both dead, and me and Ray are the only survivors of a maniac's revenge."
01:12:54.169,01:12:55.869,-You ready? I'm ready. -You ready? I'm ready to do this.
01:12:57.923,01:13:00.251,-Come on. Come on. All right. -All right.
01:13:00.418,01:13:02.712,"-Come on! Come on! -Give it to me. No, no, no, no!"
01:13:07.300,01:13:08.342,"-All right, let's do this. All right. -Ready."
01:13:13.354,01:13:14.904,You remember what we talked about? To the side.
01:13:14.933,01:13:16.908,I know. man. How many times we gonna go over this? All right.
01:13:17.033,01:13:19.204,"-I know, okay. Stop. Just-- All right. -All right. All right. I'm ready."
01:13:23.608,01:13:25.151,"Motherfucker, I'm about to cut your throat, boy!"
01:13:25.250,01:13:27.445,Stop acting like a little girl. Come on. Come on!
01:13:27.570,01:13:28.634,"-You're right, you're right. -Come on!"
01:13:28.834,01:13:30.281,"-You ready? -I'm ready. Yeah, come on!"
01:13:36.662,01:13:40.625,No! Watching television shows doesn't create psycho killers!
01:13:41.334,01:13:43.002,Canceling TV shows does!
01:13:43.210,01:13:45.796,"The Wayans Bros. was a good show, man!"
01:13:46.005,01:13:50.176,It was a good-ass show and we didn't even get a final episode!
01:13:50.259,01:13:53.304,Take it easy! I'm feelin' a little woozy here!
01:13:54.138,01:13:56.349,It's my turn. Give me the knife.
01:13:56.807,01:13:59.435,Fuck outta here. Ain't nobody stabbin' me.
01:15:06.711,01:15:18.180,"Just give me a moment. Ah, one… Ah, okay."
01:15:57.219,01:15:58.262,Are you okay?
01:15:58.345,01:16:00.723,I thought I told you not to have a party unless I was here.
01:16:01.432,01:16:03.726,"But, Dad, you were here. You were in the closet."
01:16:03.809,01:16:06.645,"Oh, yeah, that's right. Did you get some girlfriends' numbers for me?"
01:16:07.855,01:16:10.733,"-Dad, they're dead. -Ah, you know, I can't get a break."
01:16:13.277,01:16:15.738,"Okay, okay, listen, honey. Help me up now."
01:16:15.879,01:16:18.908,"Uh, uh, if the cops come, tell 'em I'm a plumber, okay?"
01:16:18.991,01:16:21.791,You-- You had a leaky faucet and you called and they sent me over.
01:16:21.941,01:16:22.912,We don't know each other.
01:16:28.918,01:16:31.504,No! No!
01:16:32.254,01:16:33.756,"Dad, Dad, put your arms down."
01:16:36.717,01:16:37.927,What the hell's goin' on here?
01:16:39.428,01:16:41.764,-He was right here! I swear it! -Who was?
01:16:41.847,01:16:45.309,The killer! The guy that murdered all my friends!
01:16:45.602,01:16:49.313,And the sick bastard planted drugs all in the house there.
01:16:49.396,01:16:51.649,-All over the place. -Dad. Stop it.
01:16:52.407,01:16:54.463,"All right, Cindy. I'm gonna have to take you down to the station."
01:16:55.084,01:16:56.153,"I'm cool though, right?"
01:16:57.363,01:16:59.073,"-I'm okay? -Let's-- Let's go, Cindy."
01:16:59.406,01:17:01.492,Cindy. Call me.
01:17:03.742,01:17:04.912,"Daddy'll get you out, honey."
01:17:07.540,01:17:11.752,Okay. Let's go over this again.
01:17:26.156,01:17:27.351,He was on the road.
01:17:27.516,01:17:29.228,And you think he came back to get revenge?
01:17:38.112,01:17:39.905,"Here, Sheriff. They wanted me to give this to you."
01:17:40.573,01:17:42.658,"-That'll be all, Doofy. -Okay."
01:17:43.075,01:17:45.578,-I'm gonna go then. All right. -All right.
01:17:47.163,01:17:48.455,"Bye, Cind."
01:17:51.834,01:17:54.253,"I'm sorry, Cindy. It wasn't the man you guys killed."
01:17:54.402,01:17:56.088,His name was David Keegan.
01:17:56.172,01:17:58.048,Some fishermen found his body a few weeks later.
01:17:58.132,01:17:59.550,He's buried in Lakewood Cemetery.
01:18:00.342,01:18:01.343,That's impossible.
01:18:03.160,01:18:04.722,Then I don't know who it could be.
01:18:04.853,01:18:08.931,"He's gotta be someone who was connected with all the victims, someone who knew about the accident."
01:18:09.143,01:18:11.770,Someone who could move around without being noticed.
01:18:14.523,01:18:15.524,"Oh, my God."
01:18:17.902,01:18:21.030,She used to baby-sit my brother Doofy. He had the biggest crush on her.
01:18:25.201,01:18:26.285,"Night, Cind."
01:18:30.414,01:18:32.291,-Doofy! -Shithead?
01:18:38.672,01:18:39.829,Has anybody seen Doofy?
01:19:35.312,01:19:42.278,No!
01:19:58.210,01:20:02.339,"Yo, if y'all watchin' this tape right now, that means I didn't make it."
01:20:02.923,01:20:06.176,"Either I'm a prisoner, or worse, dead."
01:20:07.094,01:20:10.848,"But either way it goes, I'mma tell you all the rules to survive this situation."
01:20:11.473,01:20:13.934,Rule number one: You gotta be quick.
01:20:14.768,01:20:17.730,Rule number two: Don't fall down.
01:20:18.105,01:20:22.568,"And rule number three: Whatever you do, never look back."
01:20:23.360,01:20:24.486,Y'all wish me luck.
01:20:25.446,01:20:27.031,"Snatch and run, y'all!"
01:20:31.629,01:20:32.494,You son of a bitch!
01:27:32.164,01:27:33.623,This isn't easy for me.
01:27:34.374,01:27:38.879,"I know we've been together a long time, but I found somebody else."
01:27:39.463,01:27:41.631,Okay? I'm in love.
01:27:43.633,01:27:45.051,Don't look at me like that!
01:27:49.264,01:27:51.349,You can come into my room whenever you want.
01:27:52.267,01:27:54.436,We just can't-- No.
01:27:56.646,01:27:57.773,No!
01:28:01.276,01:28:03.320,"Okay, just one time."
01:28:09.868,01:28:12.120,Yeah. That's it!
01:28:14.331,01:28:15.332,Woo!
