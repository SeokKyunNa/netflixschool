00:01:51.278,00:01:55.323,MAN: People will say I'm a monster for what I've done.
00:01:55.323,00:01:57.868,And maybe they're right.
00:02:00.037,00:02:02.372,I always thought that I'd have more...
00:02:02.372,00:02:03.582,time.
00:02:03.582,00:02:05.000,BOY: Dad?
00:02:05.000,00:02:06.585,Dad!
00:02:06.585,00:02:07.962,I'm sorry.
00:02:09.254,00:02:10.923,Peter?
00:02:24.895,00:02:27.982,MARY: He likes to sleep with the light on at night.
00:02:27.982,00:02:29.733,"Mary, we have to go."
00:02:33.320,00:02:34.738,Dad.
00:02:37.783,00:02:40.285,Be good.
00:02:48.585,00:02:52.881,MARY: I found a safe place for us to spend the night at Lake Geneva.
00:02:52.881,00:02:54.133,Are you uploading it?
00:02:54.133,00:02:55.759,RICHARD: To Roosevelt. All of it.
00:02:55.759,00:02:57.552,Just in case we...
00:02:59.513,00:03:01.098,"We're gonna be fine, Mary."
00:03:01.098,00:03:03.600,Did you see his face?
00:03:03.600,00:03:05.602,"Mary, we've been through this."
00:03:05.602,00:03:08.689,"Our life, as we know it, is over."
00:03:08.689,00:03:12.484,"We're gonna spend every day, from now on, looking over our shoulders."
00:03:12.484,00:03:14.402,Never feeling safe.
00:03:14.402,00:03:15.612,We can't do that to him.
00:03:15.612,00:03:17.698,He's just a little boy.
00:03:17.698,00:03:19.741,"I know, I know."
00:03:21.493,00:03:23.286,It's gonna be all right.
00:03:38.468,00:03:40.179,"No rest for the weary, huh?"
00:03:40.179,00:03:42.806,"No, I'm afraid not."
00:03:42.806,00:03:45.559,"Occupational hazard, I guess."
00:03:45.559,00:03:47.561,What is it you're working on?
00:03:50.189,00:03:52.900,"Uh, just-just planning ahead."
00:03:52.900,00:03:54.985,Do you think I could speak with the pilot?
00:03:54.985,00:03:56.403,Something you need?
00:03:56.403,00:03:58.739,Perhaps I can help.
00:03:58.739,00:04:03.035,I'd just like to radio ahead and make sure everything's in order for when we land.
00:04:05.871,00:04:08.790,"I think we both know that's not an option, Dr. Parker."
00:04:23.638,00:04:24.890,Richard.
00:04:24.890,00:04:26.474,They say you're a genius.
00:04:26.474,00:04:28.435,MARY: Richard!
00:04:28.435,00:04:30.562,Not if you thought you could escape.
00:04:30.562,00:04:32.731,MARY: Richard!
00:04:32.731,00:04:34.066,Mary!
00:04:48.122,00:04:49.456,Mary!
00:04:59.424,00:05:01.509,Mary...
00:05:01.509,00:05:04.096,It's okay. It's okay.
00:05:04.096,00:05:05.555,I got you.
00:05:05.555,00:05:07.515,"I have you, okay? Okay?"
00:05:07.515,00:05:09.559,Just gonna make you...
00:05:09.559,00:05:11.478,It's done. It's done.

00:05:27.410,00:05:28.745,"It's back up, okay?"
00:05:28.745,00:05:30.247,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:05:30.247,00:05:31.706,"We're gonna be all right, okay?"

00:12:49.686,00:12:51.770,I know we all think that we're immortal.
00:12:51.770,00:12:53.356,We're supposed to feel that way.
00:12:53.356,00:12:54.982,We're graduating.
00:12:54.982,00:13:03.742,"But, like our brief four years in high school, what makes life valuable is that it doesn't last forever."
00:13:03.742,00:13:07.746,What makes it precious is that it ends...
00:13:07.746,00:13:10.164,"and I know that now, more than ever..."
00:13:10.164,00:13:11.916,And I say it...
00:13:13.334,00:13:18.298,"today, of all days, to remind us that time is luck."
00:13:22.427,00:13:26.306,So don't waste it living someone else's life.
00:13:26.306,00:13:28.433,Make yours count for something.
00:13:28.433,00:13:32.395,"Fight for what matters to you, no matter what."
00:13:32.395,00:13:35.565,'Cause even if we fall short...
00:13:35.565,00:13:37.900,what better way is there to live?
00:13:49.870,00:13:52.540,I'll take that.
00:14:00.465,00:14:02.550,"This is not end, Spider!"

00:14:48.137,00:14:49.889,"Oh, Peter, for..."
00:14:49.889,00:14:53.601,"Lord's sakes, I almost stole a cap and gown to run up there myself."
00:14:53.601,00:14:55.019,"Well, I'd love to have seen that."
00:14:55.019,00:14:56.688,That would've been pretty awesome.
00:14:56.688,00:14:59.106,"No, no, this is for you."
00:14:59.106,00:15:02.026,You earned it.
00:15:02.026,00:15:04.696,I know the first thing your Uncle Ben would say.
00:15:04.696,00:15:06.239,"Yeah, I know too."
00:15:06.239,00:15:07.824,"You better hurry up, party's over."
00:15:07.824,00:15:09.325,No.
00:15:09.325,00:15:13.996,"Well, all right, the second thing he would say: Don't just follow the path, make your own trail."
00:15:13.996,00:15:16.082,That's Ralph Waldo Emerson.
00:15:16.082,00:15:18.668,"What do you mean, no?"
00:15:20.169,00:15:23.464,"Why, you really did learn something here."
00:15:25.216,00:15:28.928,I wish your uncle could have been here.
00:15:29.888,00:15:32.640,"Yeah, me too."
00:15:32.640,00:15:34.517,And my folks.
00:15:34.517,00:15:37.103,Yeah. Yeah.
00:15:41.274,00:15:42.650,That would have been good.
00:15:42.650,00:15:44.944,"All right, you can go, go on."
00:15:44.944,00:15:46.905,I'll be right back.
00:15:46.905,00:15:49.031,"Okay, guys, get together."
00:15:49.031,00:15:51.910,A quick one.
00:15:51.910,00:15:53.536,Cheese.
00:15:53.536,00:15:55.288,Okay. I'll just be over here.

00:15:57.540,00:15:59.125,Don't go too far.
00:15:59.125,00:16:00.919,"All right, all right."
00:16:00.919,00:16:02.462,Hey.
00:16:02.462,00:16:10.804,"Did your, um, did your traffic jam have anything to do with the Russian Mob and machine guns by any chance?"
00:16:10.804,00:16:13.055,What am I gonna do? You're about to do your speech...
00:16:13.055,00:16:14.974,"Gwen, honey. Family photo."
00:16:14.974,00:16:16.225,Okay.
00:16:16.225,00:16:18.436,"Hey, you coming to eat dim sum?"
00:16:18.436,00:16:20.187,Can't keep me away.
00:16:20.187,00:16:21.898,It's at 8:00-- Don't be late.
00:16:21.898,00:16:23.316,I won't be.
00:16:25.860,00:16:27.528,And I'm gonna do my speech for you.
00:16:27.528,00:16:29.363,All night? I want to hear it all night long.
00:16:29.363,00:16:32.700,"I'm gonna do my speech for you over and over again, all night long."
00:16:32.700,00:16:34.368,"Oh, my gosh!"

00:16:48.132,00:16:50.426,CAPTAIN STACY: You're gonna make enemies.
00:16:50.426,00:16:52.804,People will get hurt.
00:16:52.804,00:16:56.474,"So I want you to promise me something, okay?"
00:16:56.474,00:17:00.394,Leave Gwen out of it.
00:17:02.188,00:17:05.024,Promise me that.
00:17:05.024,00:17:07.694,"She's gonna take our picture, okay?"
00:17:18.955,00:17:20.206,Peter's outside.
00:17:20.206,00:17:22.166,I'm gonna go see if he's okay.
00:17:22.166,00:17:24.418,What are you doing?
00:17:24.418,00:17:26.212,What are you...?
00:17:28.047,00:17:29.632,Peter.
00:17:32.176,00:17:33.928,What is it?
00:17:34.929,00:17:36.180,Hey.
00:17:36.180,00:17:38.307,What's wrong?
00:17:38.307,00:17:40.351,I don't know what I'm doing.
00:17:41.978,00:17:44.397,"It's my father, isn't it?"
00:17:44.397,00:17:46.357,Yeah.
00:17:46.357,00:17:49.109,I see him everywhere I go.

00:17:56.534,00:17:58.327,It's not his choice.
00:17:58.327,00:18:02.582,I promised him that I would keep away from you.
00:18:02.582,00:18:06.085,And now I'm gonna come and eat dinner with your family.
00:18:06.085,00:18:07.420,How can I do this?
00:18:07.420,00:18:09.255,What does that-- What does this make me?
00:18:09.255,00:18:11.716,"I don't know, what does that make you?"
00:18:11.716,00:18:14.677,It makes me not able to live with myself.
00:18:18.389,00:18:20.349,I thought that it meant you loved me.
00:18:20.349,00:18:22.101,I do love you.
00:18:23.269,00:18:25.813,I love you.
00:18:25.813,00:18:29.358,Then why isn't that enough?
00:18:29.358,00:18:30.902,Because...
00:18:30.902,00:18:34.530,"What if something happens to you, just like it happened to him, because of me?"
00:18:34.530,00:18:37.450,"No, wait, wait, wait!"
00:18:37.450,00:18:39.994,I cannot let that happen.
00:18:39.994,00:18:41.996,Listen to me.

00:18:55.760,00:18:58.262,I can't lose you too.
00:18:58.262,00:19:05.269,"If because you can't lose me, we can't be together..."
00:19:05.269,00:19:08.439,"Who does that work out for, Peter?"
00:19:10.024,00:19:12.944,I can't.

00:29:04.159,00:29:06.245,"You know, Spider-Man saved my life one time."
00:29:06.245,00:29:10.624,"Out of all the people in the whole city, he saved me."
00:29:10.624,00:29:12.543,He said he needed me.
00:29:13.711,00:29:15.921,That must be a good feeling.
00:29:17.089,00:29:18.424,KARI: Sixty-third floor.
00:29:18.424,00:29:21.343,"Uh, it was nice to meet you, Max."
00:29:23.429,00:29:25.847,Wait...
00:29:42.615,00:29:44.575,Welcome home.
00:29:55.335,00:29:57.713,It's dark in there.
00:29:57.713,00:30:00.840,Your eyes will adjust.
00:30:00.840,00:30:03.552,It's better this way.
00:30:32.205,00:30:34.249,Dad.
00:30:39.296,00:30:50.265,This is not how I imagined I would die-- Looking at my son and seeing a stranger.
00:30:50.265,00:30:54.144,"You have such potential, Harry."
00:30:54.144,00:30:57.523,Such...
00:30:54.144,00:30:59.817,fierce intelligence and you're throwing it all away.
00:30:59.817,00:31:02.402,"No, you threw me away."
00:31:03.945,00:31:08.950,You kicked me off to boarding school when I was 11.
00:31:08.950,00:31:13.038,"On my 16th birthday, you sent me Scotch."
00:31:13.038,00:31:15.207,Or-or one of your assistants did.
00:31:15.207,00:31:22.964,"I'm pretty sure, because the card read: With compliments, Norman Osborn."
00:31:22.964,00:31:27.344,I don't expect forgiveness from you anymore.
00:31:28.679,00:31:31.557,I don't believe in miracles.
00:31:31.557,00:31:41.066,How could you possibly understand that your childhood had to be sacrificed for something greater?
00:31:41.066,00:31:43.527,And not just for me.
00:31:43.527,00:31:46.613,For you!
00:31:46.613,00:31:49.908,Has your hand started to twitch yet?
00:31:52.745,00:32:02.921,"When you lay awake and you feel it coming, hiding under your skin, waiting to show itself."
00:32:02.921,00:32:04.548,To show you...
00:32:04.548,00:32:07.718,who you really are.
00:32:10.763,00:32:14.516,Retroviral hyperplasia.
00:32:16.852,00:32:19.979,I never told you...
00:32:19.979,00:32:21.481,that it's genetic.
00:32:23.483,00:32:25.694,Our disease...
00:32:25.694,00:32:29.489,the Osborn curse.
00:32:29.489,00:32:33.243,And it began at your age.
00:32:33.243,00:32:35.245,Let me see it.
00:32:36.747,00:32:38.039,Your hand.
00:32:38.039,00:32:40.250,Give it to me.
00:32:46.298,00:32:48.884,The greatest inheritance...
00:32:48.884,00:32:51.136,I can give you...
00:32:51.136,00:32:52.888,isn't merely money.
00:32:52.888,00:32:56.057,It's this.
00:32:56.057,00:32:58.393,The sum total of all my work.
00:32:58.393,00:33:02.481,Everything I did to stay alive.
00:33:02.481,00:33:07.945,Maybe you can succeed where I failed.
00:33:28.841,00:33:37.599,"This just in: Norman Osborn, the legendary founder and CEO of Oscorp Industries, has died, the Osborn estate has confirmed."
00:33:37.599,00:33:43.021,"He is survived by his only son, Harry Osborn, who is the sole heir of the Oscorp corporate empire."
00:33:43.021,00:33:44.690,Harry.
00:33:43.021,00:33:50.612,Osborn fundamentally changed the medical profession's approach to human healing and affected the lives of millions.
00:33:50.612,00:33:56.535,"I started Oscorp because I looked at the world around me and I thought, We can do better."
00:33:56.535,00:33:58.119,And we should do better.
00:33:58.119,00:34:03.876,Einstein said the world cannot be changed without changing our thinking.
00:34:03.876,00:34:06.837,But change isn't just a slogan.
00:34:06.837,00:34:08.755,It begins with hard work.
00:34:08.755,00:34:12.509,Change begins with persistence and commitment.
00:34:12.509,00:34:16.221,Mr. Osborn changed the world.
00:34:16.221,00:34:20.642,And now it's up to each of us to ensure that his hopes and dreams remain alive.
00:34:20.642,00:34:21.935,But not today.
00:34:23.144,00:34:24.646,Today is for mourning.
00:34:24.646,00:34:25.772,Hello?
00:34:25.772,00:34:27.190,WOMAN: Is this Gwen Stacy?
00:34:27.190,00:34:28.734,"Yes, it is. Who's calling?"
00:34:28.734,00:34:30.861,I'm calling from the Oxford Scholars Program.
00:34:30.861,00:34:32.612,We have some exciting news.
00:34:36.700,00:34:39.244,Oh. Dillon. You stay here.
00:34:39.244,00:34:41.454,There's a current flow problem in the genomics lab.
00:34:41.454,00:34:43.040,Why don't you stay and take a look?
00:34:43.040,00:34:45.166,But it's my birthday.
00:34:45.166,00:34:47.377,Why do I have to stay?
00:34:47.377,00:34:49.922,"Smythe. I mean, Mr. Smythe..."
00:34:49.922,00:34:51.882,Happy birthday.
00:34:55.677,00:34:57.596,KARI: Bioelectrogenesis.

00:35:03.727,00:35:06.396,"Hey, guys."
00:35:03.727,00:35:07.856,The genetically manipulated in this tank...
00:35:07.856,00:35:10.358,MAX: Just a little sick.
00:35:10.358,00:35:12.151,Mm-hmm.
00:35:12.151,00:35:14.529,"I got your medicine, though."
00:35:14.529,00:35:18.533,I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday after all I put together for this company.
00:35:18.533,00:35:19.868,Designed and created everything.
00:35:19.868,00:35:21.453,Ugh.
00:35:21.453,00:35:23.496,KARI: Warning: malfunction in sector 5A.
00:35:23.496,00:35:25.540,I know.
00:35:25.540,00:35:28.251,"I bet you didn't know it was my birthday, did you, Kari?"
00:35:28.251,00:35:30.128,Think you can sing Happy Birthday for me?
00:35:30.128,00:35:32.589,I'll just have to sing it for myself.
00:35:32.589,00:35:34.507,Gilbert.
00:35:34.507,00:35:37.761,"It's Max. Can we shut down, uh, power on sector, uh, 32, please?"
00:35:37.761,00:35:39.345,GILBERT: Forget it. I'm out the door.
00:35:39.345,00:35:41.098,"What do you mean, no?"
00:35:41.098,00:35:42.474,It's dangerous.
00:35:42.474,00:35:44.810,Hello?
00:35:44.810,00:35:46.645,Fine. I'll do it myself.
00:35:46.645,00:35:48.897,And sing my birthday song too.
00:35:48.897,00:35:50.649,This is crazy.
00:36:49.082,00:36:51.001,KARI: System restored.
00:36:51.001,00:36:52.377,Have a nice day.
00:36:52.377,00:36:53.962,MAN: Harry...
00:36:53.962,00:37:00.385,"Oscorp's been under intense public scrutiny in the wake of Dr. Conner's recent, uh...breach of trust."
00:37:00.385,00:37:05.223,You mean people are pissed off 'cause he tried to turn everyone in New York City into giant lizards.
00:37:06.265,00:37:14.858,"Given that, all the animal hybrid programs he was involved in were destroyed to restore investor confidence."
00:37:14.858,00:37:16.275,Ah.
00:37:16.275,00:37:18.528,That is the Osborn way.
00:37:18.528,00:37:22.532,"Whatever's inconvenient around here, just get rid of it, right?"
00:37:22.532,00:37:26.203,Much of that scrutiny may fall on you now.
00:37:26.203,00:37:29.915,We felt that plausible deniability was your best option.
00:37:29.915,00:37:31.791,"Sure, sure, I get it."

00:37:33.835,00:37:36.213,$200 billion company.
00:37:36.213,00:37:38.381,What was Dad thinking?
00:37:38.381,00:37:40.717,"I mean, you're all lawyers, right?"
00:37:42.135,00:37:45.222,"Surely, someone must have questioned his sanity in the end."
00:37:45.222,00:37:49.768,Someone must have thought about having him declared legally incompetent.
00:37:49.768,00:37:52.896,It would have made this conversation a lot easier.
00:37:52.896,00:37:55.774,It's Mr. Osborn.
00:37:55.774,00:37:58.110,We're not friends.
00:38:03.406,00:38:04.783,Hi.
00:38:09.246,00:38:11.998,"You were his assistant, right?"
00:38:13.332,00:38:15.043,Mm-hmm.
00:38:15.043,00:38:16.461,What's your name?
00:38:16.461,00:38:20.173,Felicia.
00:38:20.173,00:38:30.016,"From now on, everybody at this table works for Felicia because Felicia works for me."
00:38:31.101,00:38:32.894,Would anybody like to speak up?
00:38:34.520,00:38:36.189,"Well, good."
00:38:36.189,00:38:39.525,Then you can all keep your jobs a little longer.
00:38:39.525,00:38:43.780,"Sir, there's a Peter Parker here to see you."
00:38:51.704,00:38:54.582,"Felicia, I want to see every file on this list."
00:38:55.917,00:38:58.170,Every single one.
00:39:05.384,00:39:07.428,Peter Parker.
00:39:07.428,00:39:10.556,It's like seeing a ghost.
00:39:10.556,00:39:12.767,"Hey, Harry."
00:39:12.767,00:39:14.853,Random.
00:39:14.853,00:39:17.689,Ten years.
00:39:18.690,00:39:20.233,Close.
00:39:20.233,00:39:22.568,What's up?
00:39:22.568,00:39:25.071,"I saw the news, man."
00:39:25.071,00:39:28.449,"I heard about your dad, and I wanted to come and..."
00:39:28.449,00:39:31.410,"Just wanted to come and see you, check to see how you were doing."
00:39:31.410,00:39:32.620,"Yeah, I'm, uh..."
00:39:32.620,00:39:35.790,I'm with some people.
00:39:38.376,00:39:40.378,I'm in a...
00:39:40.378,00:39:42.005,I'm in a meeting.
00:39:42.005,00:39:43.965,I'm sorry. I don't...
00:39:43.965,00:39:45.466,"I know it's been a long time, and..."
00:39:45.466,00:39:48.594,I kind of know exactly what you're going through right now.
00:39:48.594,00:39:51.681,And you were so there for me when my parents...
00:39:51.681,00:39:53.641,"Well, that's why I'm..."
00:39:53.641,00:39:54.976,I'm here for you.
00:39:54.976,00:39:57.187,Thank you.
00:39:58.813,00:40:01.233,"Ah, it's good to see you, man."
00:40:02.775,00:40:04.944,It's good to see you.
00:40:04.944,00:40:07.822,I'm sorry about your dad.
00:40:10.575,00:40:12.535,You got your braces off.
00:40:16.539,00:40:19.959,Now there's nothing to distract from your unibrow.
00:40:23.004,00:40:25.340,There he is.
00:40:25.340,00:40:26.632,There he is.
00:40:27.967,00:40:29.886,You still blow-dry your hair every morning?
00:40:29.886,00:40:36.768,"Um, you know, one of my manservants holds the hair dryer, but I work the comb."
00:40:36.768,00:40:41.106,Okay? So...at least I'm not completely helpless.
00:40:41.106,00:40:42.982,Ha-ha-ha!
00:40:48.446,00:40:51.908,"HARRY: After graduation, I went to Brazil, then Singapore."
00:40:51.908,00:40:54.077,That's right. Yeah.
00:40:54.077,00:40:55.578,"You know, I went to Europe."
00:40:55.578,00:40:57.247,I saw you.
00:40:57.247,00:40:58.957,"What do you mean, you saw me?"
00:40:58.957,00:41:01.418,I saw you in some magazine with some French supermodel.
00:41:01.418,00:41:03.044,You know what I'm talking about?
00:41:03.044,00:41:05.588,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ha-ha-ha!"
00:41:05.588,00:41:08.466,"Dude, that whole model thing is so exhausting."
00:41:08.466,00:41:09.968,I know.
00:41:11.136,00:41:12.553,HARRY: What?
00:41:13.888,00:41:16.724,You got a lady?
00:41:16.724,00:41:18.893,Uh...
00:41:20.061,00:41:22.688,That's a question.
00:41:22.688,00:41:24.774,That's a question.
00:41:24.774,00:41:26.692,"Whoa, buddy."
00:41:26.692,00:41:29.070,"No, I don't."
00:41:29.070,00:41:31.072,Yeah.
00:41:31.072,00:41:33.866,I don't know.
00:41:35.910,00:41:38.579,I don't know.
00:41:38.579,00:41:40.665,"Yeah, I don't do complicated."
00:41:42.583,00:41:43.918,"Uh, what's her name?"
00:41:43.918,00:41:45.295,Who is she?
00:41:45.295,00:41:46.921,Her name is Gwen.
00:41:46.921,00:41:48.881,Gwen Stacy.
00:41:48.881,00:41:51.759,Gwen Stacy.
00:41:51.759,00:41:53.261,Ha-ha-ha!
00:41:53.261,00:41:54.679,She works for me? Wow.
00:41:54.679,00:41:56.389,"Well, she does work-study at Oscorp."
00:41:56.389,00:41:57.598,Is she a model employee?
00:41:59.351,00:42:04.814,"HARRY: You know, when my father sent me away, I tried to forget everything about this place."
00:42:06.232,00:42:09.319,I guess that kind of included you.
00:42:11.196,00:42:15.074,"You ain't gotta explain anything to me, man."
00:42:16.284,00:42:18.370,We both got dumped.
00:42:21.456,00:42:24.376,You ever figure out why your parents bailed?
00:42:27.753,00:42:30.048,My dad left a briefcase.
00:42:30.048,00:42:33.051,"That's all I got, a briefcase full of junk."
00:42:33.051,00:42:34.302,Whatever.
00:42:34.302,00:42:35.761,I try not to think about it.
00:42:35.761,00:42:37.638,How's that working out for you?
00:42:37.638,00:42:40.141,Perfectly.
00:42:46.731,00:42:48.066,Nice arm.
00:42:48.066,00:42:49.484,It's just the wrist.
00:42:49.484,00:42:50.818,"It's just all in the wrist, buddy."
00:42:50.818,00:42:53.821,"You could do it too, if you just strengthened up that."
00:42:53.821,00:42:55.365,"Yeah, right."
00:42:55.365,00:42:59.118,"You got to admit, though, things have gotten crazy around here, man."
00:42:59.118,00:43:01.329,Giant lizards and...
00:43:01.329,00:43:03.289,spider guys.
00:43:05.417,00:43:06.792,Just one guy.
00:43:06.792,00:43:08.336,Just one spider man.
00:43:08.336,00:43:11.589,Or woman.
00:43:11.589,00:43:13.049,"Whatever, dude."
00:43:13.049,00:43:16.386,He wears spandex to rescue kittens from trees.
00:43:16.386,00:43:18.596,I'm so impressed.
00:43:18.596,00:43:20.973,I kind of like to think he gives people hope.
00:43:20.973,00:43:22.808,For what?
00:43:22.808,00:43:25.811,Maybe eventually everything's going to be all right.
00:43:25.811,00:43:28.565,"Yeah, I just wish I had time for eventually."
00:43:31.943,00:43:33.903,MAN: Who was he?
00:43:33.903,00:43:35.238,Maxwell Dillon.
00:43:35.238,00:43:36.906,Electrical engineer.
00:43:36.906,00:43:39.825,No associates or friends to speak of.
00:43:39.825,00:43:42.287,He submitted specs for the grid that we...
00:43:42.287,00:43:44.747,appropriated.
00:43:44.747,00:43:46.707,invisible.
00:43:46.707,00:43:51.754,"Wall Street's nervous enough with that child, Harry, taking over."
00:43:51.754,00:43:53.798,We've got to find a way to get him out.
00:43:53.798,00:43:58.677,"In the meantime, if the press gets hold of this accident, our stock will crater."
00:43:58.677,00:44:02.807,So make sure this Mr. Dillon stays invisible.
00:44:04.434,00:44:07.979,This could prove useful for us in the future.
00:45:14.170,00:45:15.547,Hey.
00:45:40.530,00:45:42.739,"MAN: Hey, moron!"
00:45:42.739,00:45:44.576,Get out of the street!
00:45:57.296,00:45:58.464,Hey.
00:45:58.464,00:45:59.882,Hi.
00:46:01.467,00:46:03.928,Hi.
00:46:03.928,00:46:05.471,You look amazing.
00:46:07.348,00:46:09.308,I'm sorry for the spontaneous outreach.
00:46:09.308,00:46:11.185,I didn't...
00:46:11.185,00:46:12.562,"No, I don't... I..."
00:46:12.562,00:46:15.523,"Spontaneous...is all right, you know."
00:46:15.523,00:46:18.943,"Well, I just figured it was time."
00:46:18.943,00:46:21.195,You know?
00:46:21.195,00:46:23.448,Time that we try to be friends.
00:46:24.616,00:46:25.950,Okay.
00:46:27.744,00:46:29.161,"Friends, yeah."
00:46:29.161,00:46:32.331,That's...great.
00:46:32.331,00:46:34.875,I just don't want us to be complicated.
00:46:34.875,00:46:37.211,I was just saying that to someone. I hate complicated.
00:46:37.211,00:46:39.380,Keep it simple.
00:46:39.380,00:46:41.716,"Okay. Great, great."
00:46:41.716,00:46:43.175,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:46:43.175,00:46:44.385,"Well, I mean..."
00:46:46.178,00:46:48.347,"Ha, ha! If, uh..."
00:46:46.178,00:46:50.349,"If we're going to be friends, I think we got to..."
00:46:50.349,00:46:52.809,Some ground rules.
00:46:52.809,00:46:54.729,"Yeah, some ground rules."
00:46:54.729,00:46:57.356,Like that.
00:46:58.524,00:47:00.568,That-that laugh. That laugh.
00:47:00.568,00:47:02.487,That's off the table.
00:47:02.487,00:47:04.821,My laugh is off the table?
00:47:02.487,00:47:07.116,That laugh is off the ta-- You got-- You got to figure out a more annoying laugh.
00:47:09.368,00:47:11.746,Ha-ha-ha!
00:47:11.746,00:47:13.914,That was not adorable.
00:47:13.914,00:47:15.207,"No, it's not adorable."
00:47:15.207,00:47:16.833,Okay. I have a ground rule.
00:47:16.833,00:47:19.128,"Oh, good. What is it?"
00:47:19.128,00:47:25.760,"Uh, don't tell me that I look amazing with your big, brown doe eyes."
00:47:25.760,00:47:27.052,Okay?
00:47:27.052,00:47:30.097,I'm really serious about that.
00:47:31.140,00:47:33.100,"Oh, no."
00:47:33.100,00:47:35.186,I just figured out the next ground rule.
00:47:35.186,00:47:36.729,What?
00:47:36.729,00:47:38.356,No more of this.
00:47:38.356,00:47:40.899,No more-- No more of this little nose rub that you do.
00:47:40.899,00:47:42.527,This?
00:47:42.527,00:47:45.613,What am I supposed to do?
00:47:45.613,00:47:47.448,This is killing me. I...
00:47:47.448,00:47:50.034,You're just spitting in the face of my ground rules. I'm out.
00:47:50.034,00:47:52.745,Come on.
00:47:52.745,00:47:55.748,"First, we get ice cream and then I'm out."
00:48:34.161,00:48:35.830,"Uh, yeah, so I did that."
00:48:35.830,00:48:38.875,And I got...
00:48:35.830,00:48:40.752,completely addicted to this place that has Korean meatballs.
00:48:40.752,00:48:42.127,Yeah.
00:48:42.127,00:48:43.671,"Oh, I know, no."
00:48:43.671,00:48:45.089,"Oh, that place on 6th."
00:48:45.089,00:48:47.174,You love it there.
00:48:49.009,00:48:51.928,How do you know that?
00:48:51.928,00:48:53.598,Hmm?
00:48:53.598,00:48:56.475,How do you know I love it there?
00:48:56.475,00:48:59.645,"'Cause, um..."
00:48:59.645,00:49:02.106,'Cause you told me.
00:49:04.483,00:49:07.027,It just opened last month.
00:49:10.155,00:49:12.324,Have you been following me?
00:49:17.162,00:49:19.081,I knew it.
00:49:19.081,00:49:21.250,How often?
00:49:24.545,00:49:27.882,"Just once a day, sometimes."
00:49:29.759,00:49:31.803,Sometimes more.
00:49:35.848,00:49:37.974,"Oh, boy."
00:49:37.974,00:49:39.811,Why?
00:49:42.939,00:49:45.483,Make sure I'm safe?
00:49:45.483,00:49:46.943,And...
00:49:46.943,00:49:48.360,And what?
00:49:48.360,00:49:52.156,And because it's the closest I can get to still being with you.
00:50:03.918,00:50:06.629,I'm moving to England.
00:50:14.219,00:50:16.138,What?
00:50:16.138,00:50:17.765,Yeah. I'm...
00:50:17.765,00:50:22.353,"I have a, um... I'm up for a scholarship to Oxford."
00:50:22.353,00:50:24.188,In molecular medicine.
00:50:24.188,00:50:28.233,"And it's between me and this other kid, and there's this oral exam that we have to do."
00:50:28.233,00:50:32.530,"And he's, like, a freshman in college, but he's 14, and, um...and it's..."
00:50:32.530,00:50:34.573,"It could be him, but it might be me."
00:50:34.573,00:50:35.992,I hope it's me.
00:50:35.992,00:50:37.576,And I'm thinking that I'll go to...
00:50:37.576,00:50:39.996,I'll be moving to England.
00:50:39.996,00:50:41.246,Wow.
00:50:41.246,00:50:42.498,Yeah.
00:50:42.498,00:50:45.334,And I'm really excited.
00:50:45.334,00:50:47.545,"That's, uh..."
00:50:49.839,00:50:51.632,England.

00:54:14.919,00:54:17.504,You swooped me up.
00:54:17.504,00:54:19.297,You said you needed me.

00:54:57.502,00:54:59.463,I can see you don't know what's happening to you.
00:54:59.463,00:55:01.381,I can see that you don't want to hurt anybody.
00:55:01.381,00:55:03.425,It'll be all right.
00:55:03.425,00:55:05.052,Standing by.
00:55:03.425,00:55:07.179,I don't want them shooting me anymore.

00:55:21.526,00:55:23.403,I just wanted everyone to see me.
00:55:23.403,00:55:25.906,"He makes a move, you take that shot."
00:55:25.906,00:55:27.323,How about you come with me?
00:55:27.323,00:55:28.784,We'll go somewhere.

01:00:13.068,01:00:14.694,That's right.
01:00:13.068,01:00:18.323,"We're standing here with two eyewitnesses, who are going to tell us what they just saw."
01:00:18.323,01:00:20.200,"Tell us, how to you think Spider-Man did it?"
01:00:20.200,01:00:21.993,How do you think he beat this creature?
01:00:21.993,01:00:26.164,It's gotta be rubberized-- Spidey's suit-- That's why he didn't get electrocuted.
01:00:26.164,01:00:28.250,Probably neoprene.
01:00:28.250,01:00:30.544,"ABO: Okay, thank you very much, to the two of you."
01:00:30.544,01:00:32.129,So many questions remain unanswered.
01:00:32.129,01:00:35.466,But we will bring you the latest information as it becomes available.
01:00:35.466,01:00:37.008,"For now, Jessica Abo, New York 1."
01:00:37.008,01:00:38.718,Let's send it back to you.
01:02:26.326,01:02:31.373,Online polls show a sudden uptick in public sentiment in favor of the web crawler.
01:02:31.373,01:02:35.586,"Tonight, it would seem New York City owes him a debt of gratitude."
01:02:44.219,01:02:45.554,Aah!
01:03:06.742,01:03:09.286,KARI: Next generation military body armor.
01:03:09.286,01:03:15.833,"Features include enhanced mobility, battlefield injury repair, direct nervous system interface."
01:03:25.051,01:03:35.186,"So the common household spider, um, unlike human cells, theirs contain the power to self-heal from severe infection, tissue damage, et cetera."
01:03:35.186,01:03:39.899,We've used a radioactive isotope with compatible human DNA.
01:03:39.899,01:03:45.029,"Welcome to Dr. Jallings, Science Investigator."
01:03:45.029,01:03:48.241,"Today, we're going to be talking about electricity."
01:03:48.241,01:03:51.536,"Batteries, insulators, electromagnetic currents."
01:03:51.536,01:03:54.414,Batteries can withstand a lot of incoming charges.
01:03:54.414,01:03:57.668,"The more powerful the battery, the bigger the charge it can withstand."
01:03:57.668,01:04:04.716,"But if the incoming charge exceeds the outgoing charge, the battery might explode!"
01:04:04.716,01:04:06.050,And explode!
01:04:06.050,01:04:08.470,Boom!
01:04:08.470,01:04:11.848,"When doing experiments like this, always wear protective gear."
01:04:11.848,01:04:13.266,You're not invincible.
01:04:13.266,01:04:15.268,We're gonna need a bigger battery.
01:04:56.059,01:04:58.186,Hello.
01:04:58.186,01:05:00.188,"HARRY: Pete, it's me."
01:05:00.188,01:05:01.606,"Hi, Harry."
01:05:01.606,01:05:04.735,What... What time is it?
01:05:04.735,01:05:07.195,"Uh, late, early-- I don't know."
01:05:07.195,01:05:08.988,I've been up all night.
01:05:08.988,01:05:10.657,I need to see you.
01:05:10.657,01:05:12.283,You all right?
01:05:12.283,01:05:13.993,"Not really, Pete."
01:05:13.993,01:05:15.412,I'm dying.
01:05:15.412,01:05:19.708,But I think you can help save my life.
01:05:19.708,01:05:23.961,NORMAN: You're looking at the world's first human-spider hybrids.
01:05:23.961,01:05:29.509,RICHARD: The hope is to extract the venom from their glands and turn that into a cure.
01:05:29.509,01:05:32.721,An agent that heals diseased cells.
01:05:32.721,01:05:40.437,"NORMAN: And if I can be cured, imagine what this could do for other diseases like Alzheimer's, even cancer."
01:05:43.690,01:05:46.818,HARRY: They never made it to human trials.
01:05:46.818,01:05:51.281,"Fourteen years of research, and nothing to show for it."
01:05:53.450,01:05:55.452,Except maybe this.
01:06:03.209,01:06:05.086,Spider-Man.
01:06:05.086,01:06:07.213,What about him?
01:06:07.213,01:06:10.926,"He was bitten by one of those things, and it worked."
01:06:10.926,01:06:15.722,"I don't know how, and I don't know why, but..."
01:06:15.722,01:06:21.519,"he can do everything else a spider can, including self-heal."
01:06:21.519,01:06:23.438,I need to find him.
01:06:23.438,01:06:25.857,I need his blood.
01:06:40.789,01:06:43.583,You need...
01:06:43.583,01:06:46.043,Spider-Man's blood?
01:06:49.005,01:06:52.091,It'll save my life.
01:06:52.091,01:06:53.927,"It may not, Har."
01:06:53.927,01:06:56.554,It may not be that simple.
01:06:56.554,01:06:58.598,"You saw what happened to Curt Connors, right?"
01:06:58.598,01:07:02.310,Connors was weak.
01:07:02.310,01:07:06.857,I don't think you can just set up a van and have him donate.
01:07:06.857,01:07:08.566,"I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive about..."
01:07:08.566,01:07:10.276,"Sensitive, sensitive..."
01:07:10.276,01:07:12.487,People shoving needles and...
01:07:12.487,01:07:13.947,Wow. He's sensitive.
01:07:13.947,01:07:21.454,"Well, then, maybe you could just sensitively tell me where he is and I will go ask him myself."
01:07:21.454,01:07:22.998,What?
01:07:25.750,01:07:27.961,You took his picture.
01:07:27.961,01:07:30.254,You know him.
01:07:30.254,01:07:32.757,"Harry, I took a picture from a long way away."
01:07:32.757,01:07:35.218,I used a long lens.
01:07:37.387,01:07:39.973,I put together what you said at the river.
01:07:39.973,01:07:41.516,What I...
01:07:41.516,01:07:44.310,About how he gives people hope.
01:07:46.229,01:07:48.857,Come on...
01:08:00.577,01:08:02.537,What in the...?
01:08:07.333,01:08:09.711,Just say yes.
01:08:15.050,01:08:18.386,Don't turn your back on me!
01:08:18.386,01:08:21.723,"I don't want to end up like my father, Peter."
01:08:21.723,01:08:25.518,Please.
01:08:25.518,01:08:28.104,"Peter, please."
01:08:28.104,01:08:30.189,I can't.
01:08:33.401,01:08:34.736,Please.
01:08:39.490,01:08:43.494,I'm gonna try...
01:08:53.588,01:08:55.632,"MAN: Hey, what's security doing over here?"
01:08:55.632,01:08:56.967,WOMAN: That's so weird.
01:09:05.141,01:09:06.851,MAN: Hey! Miss Stacy!
01:09:20.364,01:09:22.533,Oh! Oof!
01:09:22.533,01:09:25.578,Hi.
01:09:25.578,01:09:27.122,What are you doing here?
01:09:27.122,01:09:29.373,What are you doing here?
01:09:38.925,01:09:41.052,MAN 1: She's not here.
01:09:41.052,01:09:42.386,MAN 2: Got it!
01:09:42.386,01:09:43.596,You're in trouble.
01:09:43.596,01:09:45.306,Yeah.
01:09:45.306,01:09:48.434,There was an accident in the genomics lab and they're covering it up.
01:09:48.434,01:09:49.769,And I found out.
01:09:49.769,01:09:51.855,That guy from Times Square last night?
01:09:51.855,01:09:55.358,I met him. He was an electrical engineer in the building.
01:09:55.358,01:09:57.318,"And he loved Spider-Man, by the way."
01:09:57.318,01:09:58.569,"He was, like, a fanatic."
01:09:58.569,01:10:00.071,I didn't get a love vibe last night.
01:10:00.071,01:10:02.448,More of a want-to-kill-me- with-his-electricity vibe.
01:10:02.448,01:10:04.617,That's actually kind of what it's like to love you.
01:10:04.617,01:10:08.997,"I was searching for him in the computer and all the files, he's erased."
01:10:08.997,01:10:10.707,He's completely erased.
01:10:10.707,01:10:11.958,That's Oscorp.
01:10:11.958,01:10:13.751,And what about you?
01:10:13.751,01:10:15.503,Why are you here?
01:10:15.503,01:10:17.005,Osborn?
01:10:17.005,01:10:19.174,What do you mean?
01:10:19.174,01:10:24.554,"and he thinks the only thing that's gonna save his life is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood."
01:10:24.554,01:10:27.140,"And as far as I know, if I give it to him, it could kill him."
01:10:27.140,01:10:29.266,Or something worse.
01:10:29.266,01:10:31.102,I know.
01:10:31.102,01:10:33.730,"This is the maintenance closet, Gwen."
01:10:33.730,01:10:37.233,This is the most clichéd hiding place you could've chosen.
01:10:37.233,01:10:38.902,This is the stupidest hiding place.
01:10:38.902,01:10:40.778,"Oh, I'm sorry..."
01:10:38.902,01:10:43.656,I didn't take us to the Bahamas of hiding places.
01:10:43.656,01:10:47.952,"I gotta talk to you about England, I guess, because I don't..."
01:10:56.878,01:10:59.047,You just kissed me.
01:10:59.047,01:11:00.464,I couldn't help it.
01:11:00.464,01:11:02.466,How'd you like it?
01:11:02.466,01:11:04.343,It felt a little bit rushed.
01:11:04.343,01:11:06.679,I know. I know.
01:11:06.679,01:11:08.514,This is the plan.
01:11:08.514,01:11:09.807,"I'm gonna distract him, okay?"
01:11:09.807,01:11:11.893,Okay.
01:11:26.323,01:11:27.951,God! Damn it!
01:11:27.951,01:11:31.704,I just spilled a hot latte all over your-- I didn't mean to do that.
01:11:31.704,01:11:32.997,"Oh, no! And you too?"
01:11:32.997,01:11:34.665,I'm sorry.
01:11:34.665,01:11:36.709,"PETER: I'm sorry, sir."
01:11:36.709,01:11:38.294,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!"
01:11:38.294,01:11:40.255,Hey! Stop!
01:11:41.714,01:11:43.007,All right. On your way.
01:11:43.007,01:11:45.676,I'm sorry.
01:11:49.973,01:11:53.059,Gwen Stacy.
01:11:53.059,01:11:54.727,Sorry.
01:11:54.727,01:11:56.980,"No, it's okay."
01:11:56.980,01:11:59.732,"Uh, I'm... I'm Harry."
01:11:59.732,01:12:01.276,Yeah.
01:12:01.276,01:12:03.027,I'm an old friend of Peter's.
01:12:03.027,01:12:05.613,"Yeah, I know who you are."
01:12:05.613,01:12:07.490,I was kind of rushing.
01:12:07.490,01:12:10.285,"No, I'm-I'm sorry he never introduced us."
01:12:10.285,01:12:12.495,I thought you two had broken up.
01:12:12.495,01:12:15.039,Oh...
01:12:15.039,01:12:17.667,"Yeah. Yes, we had."
01:12:17.667,01:12:19.460,And it's...
01:12:19.460,01:12:21.545,It's complicated.
01:12:21.545,01:12:23.256,"I mean, it's Peter."
01:12:23.256,01:12:25.258,Everything's always complicated with Peter.
01:12:25.258,01:12:28.678,"Ha-ha-ha, yeah."
01:12:28.678,01:12:30.596,"Yeah, you're right."
01:12:30.596,01:12:32.598,But that's why he needs you.
01:12:32.598,01:12:35.059,Right?
01:12:37.394,01:12:40.106,To help him make his choices clear.
01:12:43.151,01:12:45.069,"Nice to meet you, Harry."
01:12:45.069,01:12:48.031,"Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen."
01:13:43.627,01:13:48.007,You've been in a terrible accident.
01:13:48.007,01:13:50.885,I'm Dr. Kafka.
01:13:50.885,01:13:52.970,I'm here to help you.
01:13:52.970,01:13:55.390,"Course you are, Doc."
01:13:55.390,01:14:00.103,That's why you're preparing military-grade biostim electrodes.
01:14:00.103,01:14:03.314,High-intensity capacitors.
01:14:03.314,01:14:05.108,The kind they make at Oscorp.
01:14:05.108,01:14:08.403,All of this 'cause you're trying to help me.
01:14:08.403,01:14:09.653,You are correct.
01:14:09.653,01:14:19.414,"I'm here to study you, to understand what you are, why you are, und I will get results."
01:14:23.834,01:14:26.712,I always do.
01:14:28.547,01:14:30.549,You do realize...
01:14:30.549,01:14:32.802,you locked me in a prison...
01:14:32.802,01:14:34.804,that runs...
01:14:34.804,01:14:36.764,on electricity.
01:14:38.599,01:14:41.936,I can feel it in the walls.
01:14:41.936,01:14:44.730,I can feel it in my veins.
01:14:44.730,01:14:47.650,"No matter what you do, Doc, you can't contain it."
01:14:48.901,01:14:51.362,It's a force of nature.
01:14:51.362,01:14:53.781,Like me.
01:14:59.870,01:15:01.872,You want to know how powerful I am?
01:15:01.872,01:15:04.334,Ja.
01:15:08.879,01:15:12.175,I'm dying...to know...
01:15:12.175,01:15:14.593,Doc.
01:15:14.593,01:15:17.847,But you better make damn sure you kill me this time.
01:15:17.847,01:15:26.856,"'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna kill the light, so everyone in this city is gonna know how it feels to live in my world."
01:15:26.856,01:15:29.442,A world without power.
01:15:29.442,01:15:32.611,A world without mercy.
01:15:32.611,01:15:35.906,A world without Spider-Man.
01:15:35.906,01:15:40.744,And everyone will be able to see me for who I truly am.
01:15:40.744,01:15:43.414,And who are you?
01:15:43.414,01:15:45.375,Don't you know?
01:15:45.375,01:15:47.043,I'm Electro.
01:15:50.629,01:15:52.507,AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning.
01:15:52.507,01:15:55.510,Electrical restraint capacity reached.
01:15:55.510,01:15:58.888,Initiate lockdown procedure immediately.
01:15:58.888,01:16:03.267,"Very impressive, Electro."
01:16:03.267,01:16:04.643,Lockdown initiated.
01:16:17.990,01:16:20.159,PETER: Aunt May?
01:16:25.456,01:16:26.874,What are you doing?
01:16:26.874,01:16:28.834,When did you do this?
01:16:38.094,01:16:40.763,"There's something you're not telling me, Aunt May."
01:16:40.763,01:16:44.517,"Every time I mention my parents, your eyes go down."
01:16:44.517,01:16:46.227,I know you're not telling me something.
01:16:46.227,01:16:47.853,You lie to me.
01:16:47.853,01:16:49.980,I don't lie to you.
01:16:49.980,01:16:51.482,"Aunt May, Aunt May."
01:16:51.482,01:16:54.944,"You have to tell me, May."
01:16:54.944,01:16:56.529,That's my father.
01:16:56.529,01:16:58.364,"Yes, he was your father."
01:16:58.364,01:17:02.493,But that didn't seem to stop him from leaving you...here.
01:17:03.578,01:17:06.289,I need the truth.
01:17:08.249,01:17:10.960,"The truth is, your parents left you here, on our doorstep."
01:17:10.960,01:17:15.839,And you were this little boy whose whole world was turned upside down with no explanation.
01:17:15.839,01:17:20.719,"We did the best we could, your Uncle Ben and I."
01:17:20.719,01:17:24.723,"I mean, who else was gonna care for you and protect you and worry about you?"
01:17:24.723,01:17:26.142,Your father?
01:17:26.142,01:17:27.518,No.
01:17:27.518,01:17:34.775,I was the one who wiped your nose and made you brush your teeth and do your homework or washed your dirty underwear. Me!
01:17:34.775,01:17:44.827,"Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who doesn't know how to make ends meet, who has to take nursing classes with 22-year-old kids so I can pay for you to go to college."
01:17:44.827,01:17:46.745,And I don't know how to do this without Ben.
01:17:46.745,01:17:48.414,I don't know how.
01:17:48.414,01:17:55.338,And-and you're dreaming about your perfect father who was never here. No.
01:17:55.338,01:17:58.132,"No, I won't tell you."
01:17:58.132,01:17:59.634,You're my boy.
01:17:59.634,01:18:01.927,"As far as I'm concerned, you're my boy."
01:18:01.927,01:18:03.387,And I won't hurt you.
01:18:12.688,01:18:14.773,I'm your boy.
01:18:14.773,01:18:17.401,You're my everything.
01:18:17.401,01:18:20.070,You're enough.
01:18:20.070,01:18:21.780,You're more than enough.
01:18:21.780,01:18:24.116,That's not what this is about.
01:18:24.116,01:18:26.785,I love you so much.
01:18:26.785,01:18:28.829,I know.
01:18:32.625,01:18:33.959,It's okay.
01:18:35.336,01:18:36.671,It's okay.
01:18:39.590,01:18:41.676,May...
01:18:43.678,01:18:46.055,I need to know.
01:18:50.476,01:18:52.269,All right.
01:18:55.439,01:18:57.692,I'll tell you everything I know.
01:18:59.776,01:19:01.820,But it will hurt you.
01:19:01.820,01:19:04.114,Okay.
01:19:06.992,01:19:13.249,"A few days after the funeral, two government men came to see us."
01:19:14.500,01:19:24.677,They said the genetics research that your father was doing with Norman Osborn was very valuable and that people would pay a lot for it.
01:19:24.677,01:19:27.054,And that's why he ran off with it.
01:19:27.054,01:19:28.889,They said he was a traitor.
01:19:28.889,01:19:31.058,"I couldn't believe it, Peter."
01:19:31.058,01:19:36.606,"They told us he betrayed his best friend, all of us, for the money."
01:19:36.606,01:19:38.691,I don't...
01:19:40.276,01:19:41.818,"Oh, I don't get it."
01:19:41.818,01:19:43.529,"No, I don't-- This doesn't make sense."
01:19:43.529,01:19:44.697,"Yes, I know. I know."
01:19:44.697,01:19:46.449,I didn't believe it either.
01:19:46.449,01:19:48.701,I didn't believe it...
01:19:48.701,01:19:49.993,"Peter, I don't know."
01:19:49.993,01:19:53.372,"For so long, I would play it over and over and over in my head."
01:19:53.372,01:19:55.832,What had I missed?
01:19:55.832,01:19:58.919,"He was just this normal, unassuming guy."
01:19:58.919,01:20:02.047,He wore the same ratty lab coat for 20 years.
01:20:02.047,01:20:07.720,"He took the D train to work at 7 every morning, came home at 6 every night."
01:20:07.720,01:20:10.139,I don't know.
01:20:10.139,01:20:14.810,Maybe everyone has a part of themselves they hide.
01:20:14.810,01:20:17.271,Even from the people they love.
01:20:23.319,01:20:24.945,Peter.
01:20:26.822,01:20:28.949,Peter.
01:20:32.828,01:20:34.997,SPIDER-MAN: Mr. Osborn.
01:20:39.669,01:20:41.712,Look up.
01:20:41.712,01:20:43.631,Think you're looking for me.
01:20:46.300,01:20:49.928,I cannot believe my eyes.
01:20:49.928,01:20:51.972,Spider-Man.
01:20:58.813,01:21:01.816,Just the man I wanted to see.
01:21:03.359,01:21:06.320,"You, um..."
01:21:06.320,01:21:08.364,talked to Peter?
01:21:08.364,01:21:10.449,Yeah.
01:21:15.120,01:21:17.581,"I want to help you, Mr. Osborn."
01:21:17.581,01:21:19.792,"I really, really do."
01:21:19.792,01:21:21.960,I can't give you my blood.
01:21:21.960,01:21:23.212,Not right now.
01:21:23.212,01:21:25.255,Excuse me?
01:21:25.255,01:21:28.634,It's too dangerous.
01:21:28.634,01:21:31.220,"If our blood is incompatible, you could die."
01:21:31.220,01:21:35.599,I'm already dying.
01:21:35.599,01:21:38.227,Your blood can't make me die more.
01:21:38.227,01:21:40.270,But it could do something worse.
01:21:42.231,01:21:45.693,Okay.
01:21:45.693,01:21:47.570,"All right, how much?"
01:21:47.570,01:21:50.197,How much what?
01:21:50.197,01:21:51.490,You want a boat?
01:21:51.490,01:21:53.116,You want a plane?
01:21:53.116,01:21:55.411,How much do you want?
01:21:55.411,01:21:57.830,Come on!
01:21:57.830,01:21:59.665,I don't.
01:22:01.667,01:22:03.960,I thought you...
01:22:03.960,01:22:07.172,I thought you were supposed to save people.
01:22:07.172,01:22:11.218,"I thought that's what you do, is you save people's lives."
01:22:11.218,01:22:13.846,You're... You're just gonna let me die.
01:22:13.846,01:22:15.890,I'm trying to protect you right now.
01:22:15.890,01:22:17.474,"No, no, you are not."
01:22:17.474,01:22:19.935,You're trying to protect yourself.
01:22:19.935,01:22:22.605,Look...
01:22:22.605,01:22:27.526,we just need a bit more time to figure out something else.
01:22:33.073,01:22:35.534,I'm sorry.
01:22:44.543,01:22:46.796,"You're a fraud, Spider-Man!"
01:23:00.643,01:23:03.312,Oof! Hey! Hi.
01:23:03.312,01:23:04.814,"Hi, I got to talk to you for a second."
01:23:04.814,01:23:06.523,I'm running late right now.
01:23:06.523,01:23:08.484,Just gonna take a second.
01:23:08.484,01:23:10.193,"I'm sorry, Peter."
01:23:10.193,01:23:12.404,Just give me one minute.
01:23:12.404,01:23:13.864,and I'm gone.
01:23:13.864,01:23:15.908,Shh.
01:23:13.864,01:23:18.786,"My dad, my mom-- Everything I thought about them?"
01:23:18.786,01:23:20.830,"Lies, lies. N-Nothing makes any sense anymore."
01:23:20.830,01:23:24.792,"I got to figure out what I'm gonna do with Harry, because of course I want to save him. You know?"
01:23:24.792,01:23:26.543,I want to save him 'cause he's my best pal.
01:23:26.543,01:23:29.672,And wh-what if my blood works?
01:23:29.672,01:23:31.298,I don't know. I got no idea.
01:23:32.549,01:23:34.092,Ugh.
01:23:34.092,01:23:35.803,I got nothing. I got nothing.
01:23:35.803,01:23:39.014,"The only thing I keep coming back to, Gwen, is..."
01:23:40.182,01:23:41.725,WOMAN: Ms. Stacy?
01:23:41.725,01:23:43.477,Shall I take you upstairs?
01:23:43.477,01:23:44.728,Yes.
01:23:44.728,01:23:47.022,I'm so sorry.
01:23:47.022,01:23:48.440,I'm-I'm already late.
01:23:48.440,01:23:50.442,"Uh, can I have just one more minute?"
01:23:50.442,01:23:52.444,Okay.
01:23:52.444,01:23:54.488,I'm sorry. I'm...
01:23:54.488,01:23:56.198,I have to...
01:23:56.198,01:24:01.286,I'm at my...last interview for Oxford right now.
01:24:01.286,01:24:03.664,PETER: Oxford. I didn't know.
01:24:03.664,01:24:05.457,Yeah.
01:24:05.457,01:24:07.459,"Okay, well..."
01:24:07.459,01:24:09.545,"I'm sorry to bother you, uh..."
01:24:09.545,01:24:11.421,"...my fair lady, but, um-- My-- Madam."
01:24:11.421,01:24:13.340,"But, um, uh, who am I?"
01:24:13.340,01:24:15.009,"I mean, who am I?"
01:24:15.009,01:24:16.927,I'm one of the young professors at Harvard.
01:24:16.927,01:24:18.470,What? What?
01:24:18.470,01:24:20.681,And I've been trying to get her to be in my...
01:24:20.681,01:24:23.684,Be a part of my team for a while now.
01:24:23.684,01:24:26.770,And she's just the best person I know and a scientific genius.
01:24:26.770,01:24:28.063,And...
01:24:28.063,01:24:29.481,"Anyway, God save the queen and..."
01:24:29.481,01:24:31.233,I'm sorry everything's happening...
01:24:31.233,01:24:33.652,"Peter, can you just wait for one second? Peter. Peter."
01:24:33.652,01:24:36.071,What do you want to say to me?
01:24:36.071,01:24:37.614,What's the one thing?
01:24:41.243,01:24:43.746,"I have to go to England, Peter."
01:24:45.330,01:24:46.957,It's important to me.
01:24:50.920,01:24:52.880,"I mean, I don't know."
01:24:52.880,01:24:54.965,Maybe we're on different paths right now.
01:24:54.965,01:24:57.760,You know? I don't know.
01:24:57.760,01:25:00.846,Maybe we're just...
01:25:00.846,01:25:02.305,I don't... I've got to go.
01:25:02.305,01:25:04.474,I got to go.
01:25:06.476,01:25:07.811,Gwen.
01:25:09.897,01:25:12.441,Good luck.
01:25:14.401,01:25:16.028,Hi.
01:25:16.028,01:25:18.321,GWEN: Sorry.
01:26:17.006,01:26:21.468,AUNT MAY: He took the D train every morning at 7:20.
01:26:21.468,01:26:24.888,Came home at 6:00 every evening.
01:26:30.978,01:26:33.981,Roosevelt's secret station.
01:26:33.981,01:26:47.161,"Track 61, a secret subterranean extension of New York's D Line train under Pershing Square, originally built to transport President Franklin Roosevelt away from the public eye, to keep his polio hidden from the American people."
01:26:56.962,01:26:58.630,Mr. Osborn?
01:27:00.215,01:27:01.466,You all right?
01:27:01.466,01:27:04.302,Is there anything I can get you or...?
01:27:04.302,01:27:07.472,"No, not unless you can bring those spiders back to life."
01:27:07.472,01:27:09.265,Spiders?
01:27:09.265,01:27:16.732,The ones that they destroyed to...to restore investor confidence.
01:27:16.732,01:27:18.859,"Go home, Felicia."
01:27:18.859,01:27:20.527,Take the day off.
01:27:22.237,01:27:23.906,Harry.
01:27:25.782,01:27:29.870,I think there may be another way to get what you're looking for.
01:27:31.413,01:27:36.459,I overheard Menken talking with one of our security heads.
01:27:36.459,01:27:41.882,"Before they destroyed the spiders, they had the venom extracted."
01:27:41.882,01:27:44.467,Uh...
01:27:44.467,01:27:47.512,What?
01:27:47.512,01:27:49.472,What are you saying?
01:27:49.472,01:27:54.895,"That way, they could comply with the lawsuits but still keep the data in case it ever became useful."
01:27:54.895,01:27:56.855,Where is it?
01:27:56.855,01:28:00.483,It's somewhere in the building.
01:28:00.483,01:28:04.196,Somewhere off-books called Special Projects.
01:28:05.655,01:28:07.991,Special Projects.
01:28:07.991,01:28:11.203,"Most recent entry, one hour ago."
01:28:11.203,01:28:14.289,Approved by Harry Osborn.
01:28:15.958,01:28:19.753,Accessing Ravencroft Archive.
01:28:24.007,01:28:26.426,File 713.
01:28:28.220,01:28:30.889,What the hell?
01:28:30.889,01:28:33.100,File 71.
01:28:33.100,01:28:35.018,"Subject: Dillon, Max."
01:28:35.018,01:28:41.733,"And then I'm gonna kill the light, so everyone in this city is gonna know how it feels to live in my world."
01:28:41.733,01:28:44.069,A world without power.
01:28:44.069,01:28:47.114,A world without Spider-Man.
01:28:47.114,01:28:50.909,Warning. Your user access has been revoked.
01:28:50.909,01:28:52.869,FELICIA: He's busy.
01:28:52.869,01:28:55.038,He's busy.
01:28:55.038,01:28:56.498,What did you do?
01:28:56.498,01:28:59.209,The more relevant question is what did you do?
01:28:59.209,01:29:03.546,"An employee is killed, and in your first action as CEO, you cover it up."
01:29:03.546,01:29:05.257,"No, you covered it up."
01:29:05.257,01:29:08.093,And then you buried him in the bughouse using my name.
01:29:08.093,01:29:12.139,Ravencroft is a timeworn institution devoted to mental improvement.
01:29:12.139,01:29:14.432,You are experimenting on people in there.
01:29:14.432,01:29:16.476,Progress has its stepping stones.
01:29:16.476,01:29:22.816,"Now, in light of your deceptive criminal actions, you've been-- How do I put this gently--? Fired."
01:29:22.816,01:29:26.278,You are not going to bury me too.
01:29:26.278,01:29:29.072,Looks to me like you're halfway in the ground already.
01:29:29.072,01:29:31.533,It's only a matter of time.
01:29:31.533,01:29:34.536,You're going to die a horrible death.
01:29:34.536,01:29:37.164,Like your father.
01:29:37.164,01:29:41.126,"The difference is, no one is going to miss you."
01:29:43.920,01:29:46.380,Get him out.
01:29:53.347,01:29:55.431,I know my way out.
01:30:05.192,01:30:07.236,MAN 1: I just spent $100.
01:30:07.236,01:30:11.781,MAN 2: I'll tell you why you should put the lid on that but quick.
01:30:11.781,01:30:15.327,MAN 2: You should tell her to come down here and find one of those alligators...
01:32:38.094,01:32:40.514,Test.
01:32:40.514,01:32:42.891,My name is Richard Parker.
01:32:42.891,01:32:46.728,"Whatever lies will be told about me, I would like the world to know the truth."
01:32:46.728,01:32:58.656,Oscorp was already a leader in genetic research when Norman Osborn made a deal with a foreign military organization to continue funding my research.
01:32:58.656,01:33:05.914,"And I discovered what they were going to use it for-- Weapons-- Biological weapons, of course-- So I refused."
01:33:05.914,01:33:17.509,"And now, to eliminate me from the picture, Norman Osborn has falsified evidence against me in order to take control of my work."
01:33:20.178,01:33:22.222,GUARD: Can I help you?
01:33:22.222,01:33:24.682,"Uh, yeah, you can open the gate."
01:33:24.682,01:33:26.226,I'm Harry Osborn.
01:33:26.226,01:33:30.355,"Now, there's a patient in that Isolation Wing that I need to see."
01:33:30.355,01:33:32.982,"Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp."
01:33:32.982,01:33:36.278,"I'm sorry, sir, without a yellow badge, I can't let anyone past this point."
01:33:39.739,01:33:45.328,RICHARD: But it doesn't matter because there's something else that Norman doesn't know.
01:33:46.538,01:33:52.835,The human DNA that I implanted in the spiders...
01:33:52.835,01:33:54.628,was my own.
01:33:56.839,01:34:06.182,"Which means that without me, without my bloodline, Oscorp can never replicate or continue my experiments."
01:34:06.182,01:34:14.190,Keep Electro incubated with the 400 milligrams of sodium thiopental and phenobarbital...
01:34:14.190,01:34:25.076,"RICHARD: I have destroyed as much as possible from the archives, but I didn't have time to kill all of the spiders, so, as a scientist, my choice is very clear now."
01:34:25.076,01:34:26.660,I have to disappear.
01:34:26.660,01:34:28.871,I have to get as far away from here as I can.
01:34:28.871,01:34:34.461,"But as a father, it means I may not see my boy again."
01:34:34.461,01:34:41.801,"And, um, nothing is as important to me as my son, Peter."
01:34:41.801,01:34:44.137,Nothing in this world.
01:34:44.137,01:34:51.811,But I have a responsibility to protect the world from what I've created and to protect him from what I know Osborn is capable of.
01:34:51.811,01:34:56.024,People will say I am a monster...
01:34:56.024,01:34:58.234,for what I've done.
01:34:59.361,01:35:01.779,And maybe they're right.
01:35:03.406,01:35:07.160,I always thought that I'd have more...time.
01:35:07.160,01:35:09.245,YOUNG PETER: Dad? Dad!
01:35:09.245,01:35:10.539,I'm sorry.
01:35:29.432,01:35:32.726,AUTOMATED VOICE: Sedation off.
01:35:32.726,01:35:34.020,Psst.
01:35:38.066,01:35:40.485,I'm gonna get you out of here.
01:35:40.485,01:35:42.736,All right?
01:35:42.736,01:35:44.738,Who are you?
01:35:44.738,01:35:46.157,I'm Harry Osborn.
01:35:46.157,01:35:48.076,I want to make you a deal.
01:35:49.244,01:35:51.204,I should kill you.
01:35:51.204,01:35:53.540,Come on.
01:35:53.540,01:35:55.458,"Think bigger, Max."
01:35:55.458,01:35:57.793,I'm not the one you want.
01:35:57.793,01:35:59.254,You want Spider-Man.
01:36:00.630,01:36:02.591,And I can give him to you.
01:36:02.591,01:36:07.429,But...I need something first.
01:36:08.722,01:36:11.099,I need you to get me into Oscorp.
01:36:11.099,01:36:13.309,Get you in?
01:36:13.309,01:36:14.644,You own it.
01:36:16.062,01:36:17.522,"Uh, not anymore."
01:36:17.522,01:36:22.444,"Oscorp betrayed us both, so I can't get in there without you and you can't get out of here without me."
01:36:22.444,01:36:24.571,What's happening?
01:36:24.571,01:36:26.531,Someone pulled an alarm in the Iso Unit.
01:36:26.531,01:36:29.534,Get the containment team up there now.
01:36:29.534,01:36:31.661,You couldn't possibly know what I want.
01:36:31.661,01:36:35.498,"You submitted the design for the grid and they stole it, and now you want it back."
01:36:35.498,01:36:37.292,You just want to take back what's yours.
01:36:37.292,01:36:38.627,ELECTRO: How?
01:36:38.627,01:36:40.629,"It is all the power in the city, Max."
01:36:40.629,01:36:42.964,And it's right at your fingertips.
01:36:42.964,01:36:48.928,"And then once you shut down the grid, Spider-Man will come to you, and I want you to make him bleed."
01:36:50.430,01:36:52.014,Break it! Break it!
01:36:54.016,01:36:56.728,"Max, we don't have much time!"
01:36:56.728,01:36:59.188,"Go! Go, go! Go!"
01:36:59.188,01:37:01.566,Give me one reason why I should trust you.
01:37:01.566,01:37:04.235,Because I need you!
01:37:04.235,01:37:05.695,You need me?
01:37:05.695,01:37:07.238,Yes.
01:37:07.238,01:37:08.906,I need you.
01:37:08.906,01:37:14.496,You are my only chance that I have at surviving.
01:37:14.496,01:37:17.499,Yes. I need you.
01:37:17.499,01:37:19.417,"I need you, please! Please!"
01:37:20.502,01:37:22.295,Please!
01:37:22.295,01:37:24.005,I know what it's like to be thrown away!
01:37:24.005,01:37:26.466,"Please, Max!"
01:38:16.766,01:38:18.852,N-No!
01:38:22.188,01:38:24.440,You want to be my friend?
01:38:24.440,01:38:27.026,I thought we were already friends.
01:38:28.361,01:38:30.405,I had a friend once.
01:38:30.405,01:38:33.324,It didn't work out.
01:38:33.324,01:38:35.451,"Yeah, me too."
01:38:35.451,01:38:39.038,Then let's go catch a spider.
01:38:41.999,01:38:44.836,You have one new voice message.
01:38:46.838,01:38:50.007,"GWEN: Hi, Peter. It's me."
01:38:51.217,01:38:54.721,I got in...to Oxford.
01:38:55.929,01:38:58.140,It's very exciting.
01:38:58.140,01:39:03.563,"I came by your house a little bit ago and I, um..."
01:39:00.976,01:39:11.028,"Uh, you weren't there, and so I'm on, on my way to the airport right now, because there's this early summer class that I found out about and I thought..."
01:39:11.028,01:39:15.658,that it would somehow be...easier...
01:39:15.658,01:39:17.869,"I guess, this way."
01:39:19.120,01:39:24.709,"I think that, maybe, it's time to let this go."
01:39:24.709,01:39:29.422,"And that's not because I don't love you, it's actually because I do."
01:39:29.422,01:39:30.924,"So, um..."
01:39:30.924,01:39:33.050,"Okay, bye."
01:39:47.106,01:39:48.733,"We have to move, now."
01:39:48.733,01:39:51.569,Why? What's happened?
01:40:02.288,01:40:04.958,Remember me?
01:40:09.086,01:40:12.131,"Oh, my, oh, my."
01:40:12.131,01:40:19.722,"I know it's hard to admit, but how spectacular a move is this?"
01:40:19.722,01:40:21.891,Am I right?
01:40:21.891,01:40:24.185,Right as rain.
01:40:25.436,01:40:30.942,"Okay, so, Fairy Godmother, it is time to grant me a wish."
01:40:30.942,01:40:36.238,I want in to Special Proj-- How dare you come back in here?
01:40:36.238,01:40:42.244,"You recalcitrant, unworthy, defective, urchin freaks!"
01:40:44.580,01:40:46.749,"Oh, God! I'm sorry!"
01:40:46.749,01:40:51.212,That's just not the answer we were looking for.
01:41:03.182,01:41:04.559,Clear.
01:41:06.143,01:41:09.898,Welcome back to the bonus round.
01:41:09.898,01:41:13.943,"Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?"
01:41:17.947,01:41:21.158,The grid is all yours.
01:41:52.857,01:41:55.860,HARRY: The spider venom.
01:42:01.574,01:42:03.409,What is all this stuff?
01:42:03.409,01:42:05.494,The future.
01:42:17.548,01:42:20.009,Load one up.
01:42:24.221,01:42:25.807,It won't work.
01:42:25.807,01:42:29.727,"We ran every diagnostic test, apart from human trials."
01:42:29.727,01:42:31.646,You've actually already run human trials.
01:42:31.646,01:42:33.940,You're just too stupid to know it.
01:42:37.693,01:42:40.029,Do it. Now.
01:42:59.423,01:43:02.093,You had it all this time.
01:44:30.723,01:44:32.808,It's Spider-Man!
01:44:38.397,01:44:39.899,Stop the cab.
01:44:39.899,01:44:42.235,"Lady, I ain't even moving."
01:45:12.098,01:45:13.766,PETER: Hi.
01:45:15.059,01:45:16.978,Did you get my message?
01:45:16.978,01:45:18.687,The message over there.
01:45:18.687,01:45:20.522,That was you?
01:45:20.522,01:45:22.733,I couldn't make it out.
01:45:22.733,01:45:25.694,"Says, I love you."
01:45:25.694,01:45:27.989,'Cause I love you.
01:45:27.989,01:45:29.740,"And no offense, but you're wrong."
01:45:29.740,01:45:31.284,I'm wrong about what?
01:45:31.284,01:45:33.326,You're wrong about us being on different paths.
01:45:33.326,01:45:36.289,We're not on different paths.
01:45:36.289,01:45:39.208,And you're always gonna be my path.
01:45:39.208,01:45:43.336,And I know there's a million reasons why we shouldn't be together.
01:45:43.336,01:45:45.422,But I'm tired of them.
01:45:47.800,01:45:50.636,I'm tired of every single one of them.
01:45:50.636,01:45:54.556,We've all got to make a choice.
01:45:54.556,01:45:56.100,Right?
01:45:58.560,01:46:01.563,"So, here's my thought."
01:46:01.563,01:46:03.191,What?
01:46:03.191,01:46:05.901,England.
01:46:05.901,01:46:07.444,Both of us.
01:46:09.030,01:46:11.199,I'm following you now.
01:46:11.199,01:46:13.117,I'm just gonna follow you everywhere.
01:46:13.117,01:46:15.703,I'm just gonna follow you the rest of my life.
01:46:15.703,01:46:19.623,"I mean, they got crime there, in England."
01:46:19.623,01:46:20.958,Yeah.
01:46:19.623,01:46:22.417,"They got, they got tons of crime, it seems."
01:46:22.417,01:46:24.753,Tons.
01:46:24.753,01:46:27.006,Jack the Ripper.
01:46:27.006,01:46:28.381,What?
01:46:28.381,01:46:30.343,They haven't caught Jack the Ripper yet.
01:46:30.343,01:46:32.220,You didn't know that?
01:46:50.946,01:46:52.323,What the hell is that?
01:47:02.791,01:47:04.543,Is that Max?
01:47:04.543,01:47:08.421,He must have cut the power to the whole city.
01:47:13.261,01:47:15.763,"WOMAN: Nine-nine, hold."
01:47:15.763,01:47:18.515,TNS 322 Newark.
01:47:18.515,01:47:20.559,MAN 1: I got nothing.
01:47:20.559,01:47:22.644,"Hey, I need, uh, Tech Ops up here right now."
01:47:22.644,01:47:25.314,The phones are down. Somebody go down and grab Tech Ops.
01:47:25.314,01:47:27.524,"Hey, write down what you remember, people."
01:47:27.524,01:47:30.527,"There's got to be some kind of blackout plan, right?"
01:47:30.527,01:47:31.904,Some kind of backup?
01:47:31.904,01:47:34.698,There's an emergency reset at the power plant.
01:47:34.698,01:47:38.702,"If he cuts the transmission lines, they're never gonna get this back up."
01:47:38.702,01:47:41.038,"Every time I get close to him, he fries my web shooters."
01:47:41.038,01:47:43.498,have you tried grounding them?
01:47:43.498,01:47:45.834,"Rubber, plastic..."
01:47:45.834,01:47:48.003,I didn't try magnetizing them.
01:47:48.003,01:47:50.256,"Okay, well, remember eighth-grade science class?"
01:47:50.256,01:47:53.508,If you magnetize a nail with a battery...
01:47:53.508,01:47:55.928,It holds an electric charge.
01:47:58.097,01:47:59.472,New York Approach.
01:47:59.472,01:48:01.725,This is Pan National 273 on approach.
01:48:01.725,01:48:03.269,How do you hear?
01:48:03.269,01:48:05.313,"Approach, do you copy?"
01:48:05.313,01:48:07.815,Radio's working. It's not us.
01:48:14.113,01:48:16.449,There's no need for panic.
01:48:16.449,01:48:19.201,"Everyone, please return to your vehicles."
01:48:19.201,01:48:21.662,Go back to your cars.
01:48:21.662,01:48:23.831,Remain calm.
01:48:23.831,01:48:25.124,Do not panic.
01:48:25.124,01:48:26.834,Everyone return to your vehicles.
01:48:26.834,01:48:28.585,Go to your homes!
01:48:28.585,01:48:30.296,Spider-Man!
01:48:30.296,01:48:32.798,My father was Captain George Stacy of the 19th Precinct.
01:48:32.798,01:48:34.716,"Yeah, I knew who he was."
01:48:34.716,01:48:36.802,Jumper cables.
01:48:36.802,01:48:38.220,Yes. And copper wire.
01:48:38.220,01:48:40.722,Am I talking louder than I usually talk right now?
01:48:40.722,01:48:42.975,Yes.
01:48:42.975,01:48:45.727,GWEN: Your suit will ground you.
01:48:48.022,01:48:49.231,"Okay, good."
01:48:49.231,01:48:50.523,"Try, try, try, try, try."
01:48:50.523,01:48:52.234,"Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry."
01:48:52.234,01:48:53.861,"Okay, it works, good."
01:48:52.234,01:48:55.196,And that is why you were number two at Midtown.
01:48:55.196,01:48:57.739,Rub it in. Okay.
01:48:57.739,01:48:59.950,I gotta go.
01:48:59.950,01:49:02.203,"Gwen, you're not coming with me."
01:49:02.203,01:49:04.497,"Gwen, it's too dangerous."
01:49:02.203,01:49:06.248,I've seen the grid specs and I know how to reset the entire system.
01:49:06.248,01:49:07.916,"All right, okay."
01:49:07.916,01:49:09.584,You know you need me!
01:49:09.584,01:49:12.129,You're coming with me!
01:49:12.129,01:49:14.089,Sorry. I love you.
01:49:15.132,01:49:17.134,Peter!
01:49:17.134,01:49:20.137,DOCTOR: They gotta work with us here.
01:49:20.137,01:49:22.431,Get me Engineering!
01:49:22.431,01:49:24.725,They're battery operated.
01:49:24.725,01:49:26.227,Hang on.
01:49:26.227,01:49:28.645,Okay.
01:49:50.501,01:49:52.794,"Do you see me now, Spider-Man?"
01:49:52.794,01:49:55.964,It's time to meet our destiny.
01:50:10.603,01:50:13.857,"Tower, we're experiencing some kind of electrical disturbance."
01:50:13.857,01:50:15.401,Instruments are going haywire.
01:50:15.401,01:50:16.651,Radar is down.
01:50:16.651,01:50:18.195,We're flying blind out here.
01:50:18.195,01:50:20.072,Do you copy?
01:50:23.742,01:50:25.327,"Tower, repeat, we are standby only."
01:50:25.327,01:50:27.121,What is happening?
01:50:27.121,01:50:29.915,There are two inbound flights on intersecting paths.
01:50:29.915,01:50:31.875,Time to impact?
01:50:31.875,01:50:33.210,Clock it. Clock it right now.
01:50:46.974,01:50:49.477,"ELECTRO: You're too late, Spider-Man."
01:50:49.477,01:50:51.853,I designed this power grid.
01:50:51.853,01:50:55.107,Now I'm gonna take back what is rightfully mine.
01:50:55.107,01:50:56.900,I will control everything.
01:50:56.900,01:51:01.614,And I will be like a god to them.
01:51:01.614,01:51:03.115,A god named Sparkles?
01:51:13.292,01:51:14.709,Not this time!
01:51:14.709,01:51:16.920,Is that all you got?
01:51:36.231,01:51:37.983,ELECTRO: Come on!
01:51:41.654,01:51:43.322,You ready to give up?
01:51:53.748,01:51:57.461,"Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy!"
01:52:06.719,01:52:08.055,Just shake it off.
01:52:08.055,01:52:11.266,It's just your bones and your muscles and your organs.
01:52:13.977,01:52:16.605,"Oh, boy."
01:52:23.278,01:52:24.697,I hate this song!
01:52:44.508,01:52:48.470,"Spider-Man, bet you never saw this coming."
01:52:55.936,01:52:57.770,Really? You web me to a car?
01:52:57.770,01:52:59.565,"What are you, a caveman?"
01:52:59.565,01:53:00.982,You shouldn't be here.
01:53:00.982,01:53:02.484,You tie me up to go off to war?
01:53:02.484,01:53:04.486,I know how to help you!
01:53:04.486,01:53:06.154,I-I know the grid specs!
01:53:06.154,01:53:07.406,I can reset the system!
01:53:07.406,01:53:08.990,Hey.
01:53:08.990,01:53:10.867,I'm not messing around.
01:53:10.867,01:53:12.369,This is insane.
01:53:12.369,01:53:14.705,"Nobody makes my decisions for me, all right?"
01:53:14.705,01:53:17.541,Nobody! This is my choice. Okay?
01:53:17.541,01:53:19.376,My choice.
01:53:20.919,01:53:23.589,"Now, how do we stop him?"
01:53:23.589,01:53:24.965,He's like a battery.
01:53:24.965,01:53:26.883,So what happens if you overcharge a battery?
01:53:26.883,01:53:28.427,It explodes.
01:53:28.427,01:53:30.638,So we use his power against him. Perfect. Okay.
01:53:30.638,01:53:34.308,"I think I can reconnect the power lines, I need you to reset the system."
01:53:34.308,01:53:36.101,"Okay. When I say, you turn that power on."
01:53:36.101,01:53:37.728,"You turn it on, no matter what."
01:53:37.728,01:53:39.480,Peter...
01:53:44.318,01:53:46.278,Go! Go!
01:54:37.538,01:54:40.332,Sixty seconds to impact.
01:55:13.948,01:55:15.576,Now! Gwen! Now!
01:55:15.576,01:55:17.870,Do it now!
01:55:38.766,01:55:40.141,MAN: We're back on.
01:55:41.852,01:55:43.687,Uni 687...
01:55:54.656,01:55:57.618,This is LaGuardia Tower.
01:55:58.952,01:56:01.371,You have incoming traffic.
01:56:01.371,01:56:02.831,Descend immediately.
01:56:18.889,01:56:20.974,"All right, people, back to work."
01:56:20.974,01:56:22.225,Let's land these planes.
01:56:22.225,01:56:23.894,Are we back?
01:56:23.894,01:56:26.688,"Oh, thank God! All right!"
01:56:26.688,01:56:28.899,"All right, we're back, everyone."
01:57:04.685,01:57:06.353,I think we can still make your flight.
01:57:15.445,01:57:16.738,"Gwen, stay there."
01:57:42.472,01:57:44.933,Peter.
01:57:44.933,01:57:52.816,"When you said Spider-Man said no, you meant you said no!"
01:57:52.816,01:57:55.527,"Harry, what did you do?"
01:57:55.527,01:57:58.071,What you made me do.
01:57:58.071,01:58:02.576,"You were my friend, and you betrayed me!"
01:58:02.576,01:58:04.160,No.
01:58:04.160,01:58:06.287,I was trying to protect you.
01:58:06.287,01:58:08.373,"Ha-ha-ha, look at me."
01:58:08.373,01:58:10.834,"Hey, it's gonna be okay."
01:58:10.834,01:58:14.671,You don't give people hope.
01:58:14.671,01:58:16.339,"No, Harry."
01:58:16.339,01:58:18.425,I'm gonna take away yours.
01:58:18.425,01:58:20.301,No! Gwen! Run!
01:58:20.301,01:58:21.929,Harry!
01:58:21.929,01:58:23.638,"Harry, put her down!"
01:58:40.196,01:58:43.033,"Harry, stop this right now!"
01:58:43.033,01:58:45.243,This is... This is not you!
01:58:45.243,01:58:47.704,Harry...
01:58:47.704,01:58:49.915,"Harry, this is between you and me."
01:58:49.915,01:58:52.208,You want to fight?
01:58:52.208,01:58:56.046,Okay.
01:58:56.046,01:58:58.256,No!
01:59:04.888,01:59:07.474,You okay?
01:59:10.602,01:59:12.437,GWEN: Aah!
01:59:12.437,01:59:13.981,I'm gonna put you down right here.
02:00:33.601,02:00:35.020,Peter?
02:01:38.250,02:01:40.961,Hey. Hey.
02:01:43.088,02:01:45.632,Gwen?
02:01:47.884,02:01:50.511,Hey. Hey!
02:01:55.142,02:01:57.560,Gwen?
02:01:58.770,02:02:00.772,Hey.
02:02:02.774,02:02:05.610,Breathe.
02:02:05.610,02:02:07.612,"Hey, Gwen."
02:02:07.612,02:02:09.614,Hey.
02:02:13.243,02:02:16.454,Hey.
02:02:16.454,02:02:18.165,You're okay.
02:02:20.125,02:02:23.128,Gwen?
02:02:28.424,02:02:30.260,Stay with me. Stay with me.
02:02:30.260,02:02:31.719,Stay with me.
02:02:31.719,02:02:33.013,You stay with me.
02:02:38.434,02:02:40.061,Gwen?
02:02:41.938,02:02:43.857,Gwen!
02:02:46.318,02:02:47.777,"No, please!"
02:02:47.777,02:02:49.821,Please!
02:02:51.572,02:02:53.741,Please.
02:02:59.747,02:03:02.416,I can't do this without you.
02:05:03.746,02:05:07.250,MAN: Leave us.
02:05:10.044,02:05:11.754,You've made progress.
02:05:11.754,02:05:15.675,MAN: I've identified several worthy candidates.
02:05:15.675,02:05:21.306,"Now that Spider-Man's gone, this city will never be the same."
02:05:21.306,02:05:24.058,"Oh, I'm countin' on that."
02:05:24.058,02:05:27.103,"Speaking of progress, you're looking better."
02:05:27.103,02:05:30.023,It comes and goes.
02:05:31.399,02:05:33.276,Tell me more.
02:05:33.276,02:05:35.195,MAN: How many men did you have in mind?
02:05:35.195,02:05:37.489,I wanna keep it small.
02:05:37.489,02:05:41.201,Everything you need is already at Oscorp.
02:05:42.743,02:05:44.620,KARI: Access granted.
02:05:44.620,02:05:46.622,"Welcome, Mr. Fiers."
02:05:46.622,02:05:48.666,HARRY: Who's our first volunteer?
02:05:48.666,02:05:50.668,FIERS: Aleksei Sytsevich.
02:05:50.668,02:05:53.296,Currently serving a life sentence.
02:05:53.296,02:05:54.839,He is...
02:05:54.839,02:05:57.342,most eager to join us.
02:05:57.342,02:05:59.677,HARRY: Good.
02:05:59.677,02:06:01.721,Start with him.
02:06:01.721,02:06:09.187,NEWSCASTER: Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich was broken out of a classified penitentiary known simply as the Vault by an unknown team of men.
02:06:09.187,02:06:15.568,It's yet another example of increased criminal activity since the disappearance of Spider-Man five months ago.
02:06:15.568,02:06:19.447,The web-slinger's absence has left a hole in the heart of the city.
02:06:19.447,02:06:26.496,"Believe it or not, even the New York City Police Department has joined the chorus of New Yorkers in hoping for the return of the web-slinger."
02:06:26.496,02:06:31.000,The entire world seems to be asking the same question: Where is Spider-Man?
02:06:32.877,02:06:35.505,Too bad about that spider guy.
02:06:36.839,02:06:38.132,Too bad he's disappeared.
02:06:38.132,02:06:41.761,Seems like everybody really needs him.
02:06:41.761,02:06:43.137,Where you going?
02:06:43.137,02:06:45.265,Just to...eat my cereal.
02:06:45.265,02:06:47.100,Peter...
02:06:47.100,02:06:49.060,Where you going?
02:06:58.986,02:07:01.739,I don't know.
02:07:01.739,02:07:04.117,"You know, it's-it's so funny."
02:07:04.117,02:07:07.745,"I've been trying to clean up around here, get organized and..."
02:07:07.745,02:07:12.166,Been putting some of Ben's stuff in boxes.
02:07:12.166,02:07:17.046,"And it's so funny, the heavier the box gets, the lighter I feel."
02:07:17.046,02:07:19.549,You're throwing his stuff away?
02:07:19.549,02:07:21.092,"No. God, no."
02:07:21.092,02:07:22.385,I couldn't do that.
02:07:22.385,02:07:25.305,It's-it's part of me.
02:07:25.305,02:07:29.267,I'm just finding a...
02:07:29.267,02:07:30.893,better place for it.
02:07:34.105,02:07:37.817,I'm gonna take one last look...
02:07:37.817,02:07:40.194,and I'm gonna put it where it belongs.
02:08:04.385,02:08:10.016,It's easy to feel hopeful on a beautiful day like today.
02:08:10.016,02:08:13.060,But there will be dark days ahead of us too.
02:08:13.060,02:08:16.606,There will be days where you feel all alone.
02:08:18.858,02:08:21.611,And that's when hope is needed most.
02:08:22.654,02:08:34.207,"No matter how buried it gets or how lost you feel, you must promise me that you will hold on to hope."
02:08:34.207,02:08:36.292,Keep it alive.
02:08:36.292,02:08:39.962,We have to be greater than what we suffer.
02:08:39.962,02:08:44.050,My wish for you is to become hope.
02:08:44.050,02:08:47.261,People need that.
02:08:47.261,02:08:51.765,"And even if we fail, what better way is there to live?"
02:08:53.142,02:09:01.609,"As we look around here today, at all of the people who helped make us who we are, I know it feels like we're saying goodbye."
02:09:01.609,02:09:08.032,But we will carry a piece of each other into everything that we do next.
02:09:09.450,02:09:12.620,To remind us of who we are.
02:09:14.121,02:09:16.457,And of who we're meant to be.
02:09:17.875,02:09:20.670,I've had a great four years with you.
02:09:20.670,02:09:23.005,I'll miss you all very much.
02:09:45.278,02:09:46.529,Let's go! Move it!
02:09:54.704,02:09:59.626,POLICE CAPTAIN: Get down! Take cover!
02:09:59.626,02:10:04.589,REPORTER: I'm here live on Park Avenue and 56th Street where it is complete chaos.
02:10:04.589,02:10:09.469,A man in some sort of weaponized armored suit is wreaking havoc on Midtown.
02:10:12.513,02:10:15.308,I am Rhino!
02:10:15.308,02:10:18.102,I told you I would be back!
02:10:28.780,02:10:31.407,No! No!
02:10:36.412,02:10:39.457,Hold your fire!
02:10:39.457,02:10:41.125,RHINO: Huh?
02:10:41.125,02:10:43.544,Stand down! Stand down!
02:10:45.463,02:10:48.549,Kid! You gotta get--!
02:10:49.925,02:10:52.428,"RHINO: Look, New York!"
02:10:52.428,02:10:54.514,Spider-Man is back!
02:10:54.514,02:10:56.265,MAN: Leave the kid alone!
02:10:56.265,02:10:58.392,My baby! Please!
02:11:00.520,02:11:03.564,"Brave boy, eh?"
02:11:03.564,02:11:06.526,"Does Aleksei scare you, little boy?"
02:11:22.916,02:11:25.127,"SPIDER-MAN: Hey, Spider-Man."
02:11:35.095,02:11:36.556,I knew you'd come back.
02:11:36.556,02:11:39.099,Yeah. Thanks for steppin' up for me.
02:11:39.099,02:11:41.728,You're the bravest kid I've ever seen.
02:11:41.728,02:11:43.187,I'm gonna take care of this jerk.
02:11:43.187,02:11:44.772,"You go take care of your mom, okay?"
02:11:44.772,02:11:46.816,"All right, get out of here."
02:11:52.446,02:11:54.532,Spidey! Spidey!
02:11:54.532,02:11:55.783,RHINO: You fight me?
02:11:55.783,02:11:58.870,You fight me now? Huh?
02:11:58.870,02:12:05.793,"On behalf of the fine people of New York City and real rhinos everywhere, I ask you to put your mechanized paws in the air."
02:12:05.793,02:12:08.755,Never! I crush you!
02:12:08.755,02:12:10.297,I destroy you!
02:12:10.297,02:12:12.675,You want me to come down there so you can kill me?
02:12:12.675,02:12:14.968,Yes!
02:12:14.968,02:12:17.263,"Ah, there's no place like home."
