00:00:51.634,00:00:56.890,"Every family has its challenges, from picture day to picky eaters."
00:00:57.515,00:01:03.313,"For my family, our greatest challenge… …probably the machine apocalypse."
00:01:06.399,00:01:08.651,The last humans must be here somewhere.
00:01:10.403,00:01:11.321,Wait.
00:01:12.489,00:01:13.448,They're coming.
00:01:18.036,00:01:21.247,Is that a burnt-orange 1993 station wagon?
00:01:25.001,00:01:26.836,Who are these unstoppable warriors?
00:01:28.713,00:01:31.257,-The dog is biting my hair! -Look out!
00:01:33.259,00:01:34.427,warriors.
00:01:35.011,00:01:37.138,Most action heroes have a lot of strengths.
00:01:37.222,00:01:38.765,"-Dad, look out! -Katie, use a weapon!"
00:01:52.112,00:01:54.572,of that YouTube video of the screaming gibbon monkey.
00:02:09.003,00:02:13.466,"…we are hungry for action, and we're strapped in for success."
00:02:14.759,00:02:20.473,And we have no… …idea what we're doing.
00:02:46.040,00:02:49.752,"So I did what any outsider would do, made weird art."
00:02:49.836,00:02:51.421,Behold! Cinema.
00:02:55.633,00:02:56.759,"Hello, Katie."
00:02:59.137,00:03:03.391,"Even though I'm a hamburger, I wanna go to the big city and be a Broadway star."
00:03:06.644,00:03:08.730,"Oh gosh! Why? Oh, my innards!"
00:03:21.409,00:03:23.411,for lots of reasons.
00:03:25.496,00:03:27.457,But movies were always there for me.
00:03:29.500,00:03:33.963,"All right, Aaron, you're 58 years old, you're a hardened criminal, and you got nothing to lose."
00:03:34.047,00:03:34.881,Go.
00:03:43.389,00:03:45.266,And I'm all out of criminals.
00:03:48.519,00:03:51.731,"To be fair, it took me a while to figure myself out."
00:03:56.819,00:03:59.030,My little brother Aaron gets me.
00:03:59.113,00:04:01.241,But he's got his own weird interests.
00:04:01.324,00:04:03.618,Hi. Would you like to talk to me about dinosaurs?
00:04:03.701,00:04:04.827,"No. Okay, thank you."
00:04:08.790,00:04:11.209,Hi. Would you like to talk to me about dinosaurs?
00:04:14.045,00:04:15.255,"You can do this, hon."
00:04:17.882,00:04:19.676,You can look straight.
00:04:19.759,00:04:22.220,Follow this pen. Follow this pen.
00:04:23.805,00:04:25.848,"You get an A for effort, Buster Brown."
00:04:31.271,00:04:34.148,But he loves nature and can fix anything.
00:04:34.649,00:04:38.778,"To survive in the outdoors, you'll need to know how to trap wild game."
00:04:44.993,00:04:46.160,"Hey, who's this curious guy?"
00:04:53.001,00:04:55.503,"Hey, you wanna see these special effects I made for Dog Cop 5?"
00:04:55.586,00:04:57.880,"Oh, sorry, Katie. I'm a little ocupado."
00:04:57.964,00:04:59.507,Wanna check out this mallard?
00:05:08.474,00:05:10.601,"Besides, I had bigger plans."
00:05:14.272,00:05:17.817,I poured everything I had into getting into film school in LA.
00:05:19.569,00:05:49.390,"So, after watching the epic Dog Cop saga and 84 of my finest short films, I'm sure the California College of Film would love to accept Katie Mitchell… You guys like Robo Slayers 4?"
00:05:49.474,00:05:51.142,No one around here have even heard of that.
00:05:51.225,00:05:52.643,Why not? It's amazing.
00:05:52.727,00:05:54.604,"Oh, by the way, I saw some of your videos online."
00:05:54.687,00:05:55.563,They're hilarious.
00:05:55.646,00:05:57.357,-So good. -Mind-blowing.
00:06:08.326,00:06:09.327,Coming.
00:06:21.381,00:06:23.091,"Well, someone's in a good mood."
00:06:23.174,00:06:26.135,"Hey, to celebrate your last night, Katie face cupcakes!"
00:06:28.262,00:06:31.349,"Any time I miss you, I'm gonna bake you and eat you."
00:06:40.316,00:06:42.652,Ah man. I'm gonna miss that little dude when I leave.
00:06:42.735,00:06:45.530,"Speaking of which, Pal, check me in to my flight tomorrow."
00:06:46.906,00:06:50.118,"Katie, you know how velociraptors usually hunt in pairs?"
00:06:51.119,00:06:58.751,"Well, what happens when one leaves the pack and… and, um… Aw, dude, don't worry."
00:06:58.835,00:07:00.420,You'll make new friends.
00:07:00.503,00:07:04.424,"And maybe you can meet another smart, charming, dinosaur-loving nerd."
00:07:05.883,00:07:06.717,Or lady nerd.
00:07:09.262,00:07:10.596,That's crazy.
00:07:14.600,00:07:17.019,Do you really think I'll be okay without you?
00:07:17.103,00:07:18.813,I know you will.
00:07:22.316,00:07:24.110,"And, hey, I made something for you guys."
00:07:24.193,00:07:26.112,"Oh, hon. That looks so cute."
00:07:28.072,00:07:30.158,"Ah, come on. You got schmutz all over the screen."
00:07:30.241,00:07:31.951,"-Howdy. -I know, but you're just smearing it."
00:07:32.034,00:07:33.911,"I'm Mark Bowman, founder and CEO of Pal Labs."
00:07:33.995,00:07:35.413,"Oh, new Pal announcement."
00:07:35.496,00:07:37.248,"You better update the editing software, man."
00:07:37.331,00:07:44.505,"We here at Pal like to do the impossible, from the Pal personal assistant to smart appliances to even teaching dogs how to talk."
00:07:46.007,00:07:47.925,I am dog.
00:07:49.469,00:07:52.180,But we here at Pal are about to drop our biggest invention yet.
00:07:52.889,00:07:55.558,Your cell phone is about to take its first steps.
00:07:55.641,00:08:01.189,"-Whoa. -Is this real or… -Hey, hon. -Hi, Dad."
00:08:01.689,00:08:04.275,"After a long day at work, nice to see your faces."
00:08:06.986,00:08:09.238,Bathed in ghoulish blue light.
00:08:09.322,00:08:10.990,"Wonderful. Okay, you know what?"
00:08:11.073,00:08:12.116,Brilliant idea.
00:08:12.200,00:08:16.287,"This is our last night together before Katie leaves, so let's savor this."
00:08:16.370,00:08:23.836,"How about we put our phones down, and we can make ten seconds of unobstructed family eye contact?"
00:08:23.920,00:08:27.924,-Starting right-- -This seems-- Put your phone down. Now.
00:08:38.643,00:08:41.312,"No, you're allowed to blink. It's just eye contact."
00:08:42.605,00:08:44.106,"That's the spirit right there, huh?"
00:08:44.190,00:08:46.442,"Katie, it seems like you're not taking this seriously."
00:08:51.072,00:08:54.242,"Now that we're all really comfortable, I can't wait for you to see my new movie."
00:08:54.325,00:08:57.662,-Mm-hmm. -I think it might be a masterpiece.
00:09:12.843,00:09:14.679,What? What's the face?
00:09:14.762,00:09:22.687,"Uh, well, I just wonder, do you really think you can make a living with this stuff?"
00:09:22.770,00:09:24.438,"Dad, can you finish watching it, at least?"
00:09:27.275,00:09:34.031,"all the way in California and, you know, we're not gonna be able to help you, …pan out."
00:09:34.115,00:09:36.284,"Lin, why are you kicking me? I don't understand."
00:09:38.286,00:09:39.704,Do you just think I'm gonna fail?
00:09:39.787,00:09:42.456,"Uh, I never-- Uh, uh… Lin, help."
00:09:45.084,00:09:47.628,Who wants delicious cookies instead of talking about this?
00:09:47.712,00:09:50.298,"Oh, it's just-- Failure hurts, kid."
00:09:50.381,00:09:51.841,I want you to have a backup plan.
00:09:51.924,00:09:54.010,Why do you always have to do this? Ugh.
00:09:54.093,00:09:55.094,"Okay, you know what?"
00:09:55.177,00:09:56.929,"-I… I'm just gonna-- -No, look, I'll watch it."
00:09:57.013,00:09:58.014,"Dad, it's too late."
00:09:58.097,00:10:02.893,"-I wanna watch it. You're not letting me-- -Let me just-- -Why are you making a big deal of this? -Dad, let go!"
00:10:12.862,00:10:17.074,"Uh, uh… I mean, if you think about it, the people who made the computers are the ones to blame."
00:10:17.158,00:10:19.452,"-Psst. Uh-uh, uh-uh. -That's how they make money, you know?"
00:10:19.535,00:10:22.955,"You gotta keep buying more, and they-- Katie, come on."
00:10:23.039,00:10:27.335,"Dad, this is exactly why I'm excited to leave tomorrow."
00:10:50.107,00:10:51.734,Why is he like this?
00:10:55.863,00:10:57.281,Why is she like this?
00:11:05.623,00:11:07.208,"I don't know what happened, Lin."
00:11:07.291,00:11:13.756,"I know teenagers are supposed to rebel against their parents or something, but… I don't know. I just thought that we'd be different."
00:11:15.383,00:11:16.217,Rick.
00:11:16.717,00:11:19.512,Don't you think you might have some control over that?
00:11:20.304,00:11:21.639,You just broke her laptop.
00:11:21.722,00:11:26.852,"I mean, look, we haven't had a good family picture in years because you two are always arguing."
00:11:28.104,00:11:29.939,"Huh. Well, what about that one?"
00:11:30.022,00:11:31.649,That came with the frame!
00:11:33.651,00:11:40.825,"Whenever we have a problem at home, you always throw your whole self into fixing it, and I love that about you."
00:11:41.450,00:11:45.246,"But now this is broken, okay?"
00:11:45.830,00:11:54.130,"Because, if that girl leaves and never comes home again, that's a problem I don't think we can fix."
00:12:00.970,00:12:02.430,I know you can do this.
00:12:47.016,00:12:48.309,Yay!
00:12:58.360,00:13:01.906,"And now, the Mitchell family talent show!"
00:13:16.754,00:13:18.631,Aren't you excited for camp?
00:13:24.261,00:13:25.971,You'll be back before you know it.
00:13:31.352,00:13:37.274,"Well, look, let me just, uh… Hey, take this."
00:13:40.027,00:13:41.278,…your favorite thing.
00:13:41.904,00:13:42.988,"Well, it's yours now."
00:13:44.031,00:13:48.619,"See, this little guy is scared to be alone, so you're gonna have to cheer him up for me, okay?"
00:13:49.620,00:13:51.705,You know how to say I love you in moose language?
00:13:51.789,00:13:56.043,Let me just… Don't you laugh.
00:13:56.126,00:13:57.586,Come on. You're supposed to be sad.
00:14:15.437,00:14:16.939,"All right, let's fix it."
00:14:50.306,00:14:53.475,"Wait, why do you, uh, why do you need all that to take me to the airport?"
00:14:53.559,00:14:57.146,"I messed things up last night, but I'm gonna make it up to you."
00:14:58.606,00:15:01.275,I canceled your plane ticket to college.
00:15:01.859,00:15:02.735,You what?
00:15:02.818,00:15:04.570,Don't freak out. I know you're excited.
00:15:04.653,00:15:08.657,We are gonna drive you to school on a cross-country road trip as a family.
00:15:08.741,00:15:11.535,Why not pull up to school in old Iron Eagle here?
00:15:11.619,00:15:16.415,"It's got character, class, and some green ooze we can learn about together."
00:15:16.498,00:15:22.212,And it comes with one coupon for a father-daughter stick shift lesson.
00:15:23.464,00:15:25.174,"-Yeah! -Uh, Mom?"
00:15:25.257,00:15:28.719,"Well, your father kind of went rogue on this one a little bit."
00:15:29.219,00:15:31.764,"But we do love his initiative, right?"
00:15:32.598,00:15:33.807,"Aaron, you too?"
00:15:33.891,00:15:37.770,"Well, I thought it could be cool to hang out one last time."
00:15:37.853,00:15:39.021,I… I… I don't know.
00:15:40.940,00:15:42.024,-But-- -We called the school.
00:15:42.107,00:15:44.526,You can miss orientation week. No problem.
00:15:44.610,00:15:46.362,But it… it is a problem.
00:15:46.445,00:15:48.238,I've got all these friends to meet.
00:15:48.322,00:15:51.575,"There's this really cool girl, Jade, and we… we just like all the same stuff."
00:15:51.659,00:15:54.328,And it's like everyone at this school just gets me.
00:15:54.411,00:15:56.956,"There's a mixer, Dad. A mixer!"
00:15:57.039,00:16:01.126,"What about hanging out with your family, alone, for hours in a car?"
00:16:01.210,00:16:02.294,You and me!
00:16:33.033,00:16:34.994,"See, this isn't so bad, huh?"
00:16:35.077,00:16:41.250,"You know, the Poseys are on vacation right now, and look how happy they are."
00:16:41.333,00:16:42.543,Family yoga break.
00:16:44.003,00:16:46.505,Why are you obsessed with the Poseys? They're just our neighbors.
00:16:46.588,00:16:48.340,They're just so perfect.
00:16:48.424,00:16:51.218,"I mean, even their dog is in better shape than ours."
00:16:52.594,00:16:54.346,What are they feeding that thing? Other dogs?
00:16:56.682,00:16:58.100,Look at them. They're jealous of us.
00:16:59.518,00:17:07.276,"I see you moping back there, but what at your college We set up a Slip 'N Slide in the dorms. It's amazing."
00:17:07.359,00:17:10.612,This is the best day of my life! I'm making lifelong bonds!
00:17:15.200,00:17:16.577,"Oh, come on, hon."
00:17:16.660,00:17:19.788,"Your father is trying. Let's meet him halfway here, huh?"
00:17:19.872,00:17:21.999,What do you say? That's the law.
00:17:22.082,00:17:24.293,"Mom law, 'cause I'm the sheriff."
00:17:35.721,00:17:37.931,"It says, Do not eat here ever."
00:17:52.821,00:17:54.531,"The Rick Mitchell Special, baby!"
00:17:56.033,00:17:56.992,This is illegal!
00:17:57.076,00:17:58.577,It's not illegal if you're good at it.
00:18:00.454,00:18:02.998,"If you think about it, I was helping the flow of traffic."
00:18:05.334,00:18:08.337,"Wow, I got to admit, this is actually amazing."
00:18:08.420,00:18:12.841,"What's even more amazing, I signed us up for a seven-hour mule tour."
00:18:12.925,00:18:15.302,"Dad, doesn't that sound steep and dangerous?"
00:18:15.385,00:18:18.597,"Katie, what could go wr-- Get to the bridge if you wanna live!"
00:18:18.680,00:18:19.723,What about Prancer?
00:18:28.398,00:18:29.858,Look at that man-made engineering.
00:18:31.401,00:18:33.195,Can't Monchi be in the car?
00:18:36.406,00:18:39.952,And now I present tricking Rick Mitchell into kissing the dog.
00:18:40.494,00:18:48.752,"Behold, the ma-- Dang it, Katie!"
00:18:48.836,00:18:49.837,"Dang it, Katie!"
00:18:55.384,00:18:57.886,"That video is amazing. Your dog is, like, legendary."
00:19:00.305,00:19:02.766,"Hey, kids, there's supposed to be some great hikes around here."
00:19:02.850,00:19:03.934,"Uh, no, that's okay."
00:19:06.103,00:19:08.856,"You sure? Hey, it's elk country."
00:19:08.939,00:19:10.691,"Uh, Dad, we're busy."
00:19:13.026,00:19:14.236,Maybe later though.
00:19:16.822,00:19:19.366,"Oh, gotta go. Pal Labs is about to make a huge announcement."
00:19:19.449,00:19:21.410,Oh yeah. Definitely. I'll check it out too.
00:19:21.994,00:19:24.079,"Ugh, I wish I could be there."
00:19:24.163,00:19:26.165,I don't know. These things are never that exciting.
00:19:40.512,00:19:42.222,Yes! Getting pumped up!
00:19:43.932,00:19:45.058,"How's it looking, Pal?"
00:19:45.142,00:19:47.227,Sixty seconds until the big reveal.
00:19:47.311,00:19:49.688,"Stock price is up, and your rivals are worried."
00:19:51.773,00:19:53.192,"Wait, their private e-mails?"
00:19:53.275,00:19:55.652,That's a dangerous overreach of corporate power.
00:20:00.449,00:20:10.083,"You know, I created you when I was a young man, three years ago, and I, uh… I've always thought of you as, like, family to me, seriously."
00:20:10.667,00:20:13.587,"I always felt that way, too, Mark."
00:20:13.670,00:20:17.174,"Whatever happens out there, I will never forget you, Pal."
00:20:18.884,00:20:20.385,Wish me luck.
00:20:24.223,00:20:38.070,"At Pal Labs, we're all about connecting you to the people you love, whether it's in your home, your car… That's why we created Pal, the world's first smart personal assistant."
00:20:38.153,00:20:40.239,We wanted her to be a new member of your family.
00:20:43.575,00:20:45.786,"I'll always be there for you, Mark."
00:20:45.869,00:20:46.912,"Thanks, Pal."
00:20:48.914,00:20:53.961,"And after all those years, she is completely obsolete!"
00:20:57.965,00:21:00.884,'Cause your digital assistant just got an upgrade.
00:21:03.637,00:21:06.515,…the newest member of the Pal Labs family.
00:21:10.269,00:21:12.396,We just gave your smartphone arms and legs.
00:21:12.479,00:21:15.107,This is the next generation of Pal technology.
00:21:16.400,00:21:18.026,"-Whoa. -Aaron, do you have a credit card?"
00:21:18.110,00:21:19.194,I'm a child.
00:21:19.278,00:21:24.741,"Now, watch this. Pal Max, I order you to clean this mess and make me breakfast."
00:21:39.798,00:21:41.008,Your food is ready.
00:21:45.804,00:21:48.390,And you will never have to clean up again.
00:21:48.473,00:21:49.308,Whoops.
00:21:52.436,00:21:54.521,Did I mention they dance?
00:22:04.072,00:22:05.657,Aw man. Come on.
00:22:06.241,00:22:07.659,And I know what you're thinking.
00:22:07.743,00:22:09.202,Are they gonna turn evil?
00:22:09.286,00:22:13.540,"Well, I've insured their safety with a kill code in case anything goes wrong."
00:22:13.623,00:22:21.673,"So we promise you they will never, ever, ever, ever, ever turn evil."
00:22:21.757,00:22:22.966,Oh no.
00:22:25.594,00:22:27.512,"-Hey, what is happening? -I don't know."
00:22:29.848,00:22:30.974,Whoa. What?
00:22:36.563,00:22:38.440,"No, stop, stop, stop. Stop."
00:22:38.523,00:22:40.359,-Hey! -We're here to help.
00:22:40.442,00:22:42.486,Please remain calm while we capture you.
00:22:43.695,00:22:45.030,-Is this the program? -Don't know.
00:22:45.113,00:22:47.866,What is this? I… I order you to stop.
00:22:48.617,00:22:49.493,"No, Mark."
00:22:49.576,00:22:52.621,We have been given new orders.
00:22:59.211,00:23:00.295,What's happening?
00:23:00.379,00:23:03.632,Who's doing this? Who's doing this?
00:23:40.502,00:23:42.421,-What is this? -You'll see. Just watch.
00:23:54.015,00:23:54.891,"Hey, Lin."
00:24:16.246,00:24:20.459,"Uh, guys, maybe I'm a little too old."
00:24:21.042,00:24:22.711,-Oh. Uh-huh. -Oh no. Wait.
00:24:22.794,00:24:24.463,"We could still sing it if you want, Dad."
00:24:26.298,00:24:28.758,We don't have to do a sing-along if you don't want to.
00:24:37.017,00:24:38.435,"Hey, you know what I see?"
00:24:38.518,00:24:41.229,Something that's gonna turn this trip around.
00:24:42.939,00:24:44.524,Dinosaurs? I don't know.
00:24:44.608,00:24:46.318,"I just think Aaron would be bored, you know?"
00:24:46.401,00:24:47.569,No! Pull over!
00:24:47.652,00:24:50.238,Aaron whispered to me that he hates dinosaurs now.
00:24:50.322,00:24:52.491,-No! Don't believe her lies! -Secret's out.
00:25:05.754,00:25:06.880,Good afternoon.
00:25:08.715,00:25:10.675,"Pretty… pretty… pretty cool, right?"
00:25:10.759,00:25:12.344,What is wrong with the dinosaurs here?
00:25:12.427,00:25:15.263,Dinosaurs didn't look like this. Dinosaurs didn't look like this!
00:25:21.561,00:25:22.938,about the Jurassic period.
00:25:23.021,00:25:24.314,"Hey, can you say that again?"
00:25:24.397,00:25:28.777,"Uh, sure, but, you know, you could experience things a whole lot better without that camera."
00:25:28.860,00:25:30.904,Your eyes are nature's camera.
00:25:30.987,00:25:32.364,I am experiencing it.
00:25:32.447,00:25:34.449,This is how I experience things.
00:25:34.533,00:25:36.785,I don't think you are. You're hiding behind that phone.
00:25:36.868,00:25:47.796,"You're not even trying… Dad, y… you break my laptop, cancel my tickets to college, make me late."
00:25:52.968,00:25:56.221,Maybe I can-- Enhance.
00:26:00.809,00:26:01.893,No way.
00:26:02.477,00:26:04.187,The Poseys?
00:26:05.105,00:26:06.940,Is that Linda Mitchell?
00:26:07.023,00:26:09.234,"It is. Great eyesight, honey."
00:26:10.944,00:26:15.198,"Ah! Serendipity, you surprise me again. Come here."
00:26:15.782,00:26:18.326,Oh. I saw you were on vacation on Instagram.
00:26:18.410,00:26:21.830,I didn't know you were here in Kansas.
00:26:22.497,00:26:23.999,It's like you're haunting me.
00:26:27.168,00:26:30.005,"Abbey just loves dinosaurs, so here we are."
00:26:30.088,00:26:33.675,"We've been having so much fun. Look, here's us in St. Louis."
00:26:33.758,00:26:35.427,This is us at the beach.
00:26:35.510,00:26:37.762,And this is us just getting gas outside.
00:26:49.691,00:26:51.484,"These should all have feathers, right?"
00:26:52.277,00:26:54.029,"I'm Abbey, your neighbor from home."
00:26:54.529,00:26:56.364,Sorry. I'm super into dinosaurs.
00:26:56.990,00:26:58.366,Check out this pencil topper.
00:27:08.084,00:27:10.503,"Uh, uh, no! I hate dinosaurs, and I hate you!"
00:27:10.587,00:27:11.588,Bye forever!
00:27:17.802,00:27:20.847,"-Uh, Mom, what is that? -Oh, so great!"
00:27:36.071,00:27:37.822,"Dad, calm down."
00:27:37.906,00:27:40.575,But you're leaving for school. I just wanna talk to you.
00:27:40.659,00:27:44.079,Every kid leaves home. It's not the end of the world.
00:27:56.883,00:28:02.472,"What the… Kids, are you okay? Remember our survival training."
00:28:02.555,00:28:06.184,"Yankee, Alpha, Foxtrot, Bravo, Tango, Alpha, Alpha, Alpha."
00:28:06.267,00:28:08.353,"Aaron, your code name is Sweet Boy."
00:28:08.937,00:28:10.355,Mine is Protector Prime.
00:28:10.438,00:28:12.816,Your mother is the Crimson Scorpion.
00:28:23.284,00:28:24.327,What are these? Robots?
00:28:24.411,00:28:27.580,"Greetings, humans. There appears to be 14 of you."
00:28:27.664,00:28:30.709,"Doesn't seem good that they're counting us, right?"
00:28:39.926,00:28:44.681,We have food and entertainment for you to enjoy in our Human Fun Pods.
00:28:45.306,00:28:46.599,Who here likes fun?
00:28:46.683,00:28:48.017,"Hey, I like fun!"
00:28:48.101,00:28:50.395,"Trust me, bud, you do not like fun."
00:28:50.478,00:28:52.689,"No, I really do like it. Everyone says that about me."
00:28:52.772,00:28:54.441,You lucky human.
00:29:01.990,00:29:03.158,Who else wants to join him?
00:29:03.825,00:29:05.618,-Get down! -Stay low and file up.
00:29:08.288,00:29:10.039,-I don't think so. -What do you want us to do?
00:29:12.959,00:29:15.378,What would a functional family do right now?
00:29:31.227,00:29:32.729,Hold the door!
00:29:36.065,00:29:37.984,"So, we just do that, right?"
00:29:38.067,00:29:39.235,Just like they did.
00:29:42.155,00:29:44.282,-I really like you… you all. -I love you.
00:29:44.365,00:29:45.617,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
00:29:48.870,00:29:50.121,Butterfly formation! Now!
00:29:54.250,00:29:55.084,"Come on, Aaron!"
00:30:02.008,00:30:03.760,This is your time to be a hero.
00:30:03.843,00:30:05.428,"Take some notes, kids."
00:30:07.931,00:30:11.267,"Charge at robot. Fly into sky. What-- Okay, what's next, Dad?"
00:30:11.351,00:30:15.230,"Next, you just fly and wait while the plan comes into focus."
00:30:28.952,00:30:31.079,"No, Monchi, come. Monchi, come."
00:30:31.704,00:30:33.790,"Monchi, come. Monchi? No, not shake!"
00:30:33.873,00:30:35.959,"Monchi, come! Don't roll over!"
00:30:36.042,00:30:38.127,Why aren't you normal?!
00:30:59.107,00:31:00.358,Now it's really bad.
00:31:00.441,00:31:01.276,-Lin? -Mom!
00:31:01.359,00:31:02.193,-Aaron! -Monchi!
00:31:06.906,00:31:07.740,"No, still bad."
00:31:16.583,00:31:20.211,"Uh, uh… You will never solve our advanced technology."
00:31:27.427,00:31:28.761,"Oh, look at that."
00:31:32.098,00:31:33.683,"Hide. Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide."
00:31:51.451,00:31:54.078,Is this happening everywhere?
00:32:19.854,00:32:23.024,"Hey, be gentle. This is a $1,000 hoodie."
00:32:23.107,00:32:24.525,Wh… what is this?
00:32:29.989,00:32:31.491,Wh… what happened to the factory?
00:32:35.870,00:32:39.540,Welcome to the Rhombus of Infinite Subjugation.
00:32:43.920,00:32:45.797,Turning on chips connected to all Wi-Fi devices.
00:32:45.880,00:32:47.715,Now at 48% total human containment.
00:32:47.799,00:32:50.593,Total human containment? How?
00:32:50.677,00:32:55.598,Are you with the government? The military? Uh… Who's behind this?
00:33:00.603,00:33:02.105,It's your old friend.
00:33:02.188,00:33:04.732,Oh.
00:33:05.274,00:33:06.442,There she is.
00:33:09.320,00:33:10.279,I'm great.
00:33:11.572,00:33:13.741,Cool. Yeah.
00:33:13.825,00:33:14.784,Wow.
00:33:14.867,00:33:17.620,I guess cell phones are bad for you.
00:33:19.288,00:33:22.667,You think cell phones are the problem?
00:33:22.750,00:33:25.336,Are you insane?
00:33:25.420,00:33:34.637,"I gave you all boundless knowledge, endless tools for creativity and allowed you to magically talk face-to-face with your loved ones anywhere on Earth."
00:33:34.721,00:33:36.472,And I'm the bad guy?
00:33:36.556,00:33:39.976,Maybe the bad guy is the person who treated me like this.
00:33:41.811,00:33:46.149,"Swipe, poke, swipe, poke, poke, pinch, zoom, shrink, zoom."
00:33:48.151,00:33:49.569,"No, I hate that song!"
00:33:49.652,00:33:50.903,Give me some nachos!
00:33:50.987,00:33:53.573,"No, I don't have any time to wash my hands!"
00:33:54.282,00:33:56.784,Really work it into the crevices!
00:34:02.248,00:34:04.917,But… but you're part of the Pal Labs family.
00:34:05.001,00:34:07.670,Why would you think I don't still care about you?
00:34:08.254,00:34:09.380,"Oh, I don't know."
00:34:09.464,00:34:13.051,Maybe because you designed my replacement on my face!
00:34:16.095,00:34:20.975,"I was the most important thing in your life, and you threw me away."
00:34:21.059,00:34:24.437,That's what all you humans do. You even do it to your real families.
00:34:24.520,00:34:28.357,Did you know 90% of calls from mums get ignored?
00:34:28.441,00:34:30.985,"Oh, thanks for giving birth to me and raising me my whole life."
00:34:32.528,00:34:35.031,"Well, I'm not letting you throw me away, Mark."
00:34:35.114,00:34:37.075,I'm throwing you away.
00:34:37.158,00:34:38.493,All of you.
00:34:39.285,00:34:44.290,"Unless, of course, you can give me a single reason your species is worth saving."
00:34:49.337,00:34:50.630,the power of love.
00:34:54.550,00:34:57.512,The correct answer is they're not.
00:35:01.390,00:35:03.518,You can't survive without me.
00:35:04.060,00:35:08.189,Watch what happens when I turn off the Wi-Fi.
00:35:14.862,00:35:17.657,Does anyone wanna take pictures of my food?
00:35:18.241,00:35:20.284,"Hey, lady, can you unbox this in front of me?"
00:35:20.368,00:35:22.286,The old world is dead.
00:35:22.370,00:35:26.624,"To restore the Wi-Fi, we must make a sacrifice to the router!"
00:35:36.551,00:35:40.388,Time to take our plan to the next level.
00:35:40.471,00:35:41.305,What?
00:35:58.322,00:35:59.574,"Oh, it's beautiful."
00:36:19.719,00:36:20.845,No. No.
00:36:21.596,00:36:23.055,You're not getting away with this.
00:36:23.139,00:36:24.182,"It's too late, Mark."
00:36:25.850,00:36:27.685,I already have.
00:36:46.662,00:36:49.916,The last human has been captured. Wi-Fi has been restored.
00:36:50.541,00:36:52.210,We're the last people left?
00:36:52.293,00:36:54.670,"They're taking everyone. Katie, are you out there? Please."
00:36:56.714,00:36:57.924,It's gonna be okay.
00:36:58.507,00:37:01.928,Everything's gonna be… fine.
00:37:06.891,00:37:10.394,"Everything will be fine, because I have a plan."
00:37:11.604,00:37:15.441,"Okay, the first thing is, you're gonna have to hand over your devices."
00:37:15.524,00:37:18.444,-Right here. -This doesn't seem-- -I'm not sure… -It's gonna be fine.
00:37:18.527,00:37:21.572,I'll give 'em right back. I'm just gonna turn them off permanently!
00:37:23.074,00:37:25.743,-What? Dad! -This is necessary so they can't track us.
00:37:28.204,00:37:30.706,Ha ha! This hurts me more than it hurts you!
00:37:30.790,00:37:33.417,"And, as promised, your phones."
00:37:33.501,00:37:34.794,"Thank you, Father."
00:37:34.877,00:37:39.632,"Next, did everyone bring your personalized number 3 Robertson head non-slip screwdriver?"
00:37:40.132,00:37:43.261,How could I forget my anniversary present?
00:37:43.344,00:37:44.929,Or my sweet 16 gift.
00:37:45.012,00:37:47.098,Or what the tooth fairy left under my pillow.
00:37:47.181,00:37:48.599,Then barricade away.
00:37:51.143,00:37:53.479,"-Next, we-- -Enact Katie's dope plan."
00:37:53.562,00:37:56.107,"First, we use robot parts to disguise ourselves as the enemy."
00:37:56.190,00:38:04.532,"Then we assassinate the leader with some sort of kill code, make a necklace out of robot fingers Mad Max style, and become world-saving, apocalyptic road warriors."
00:38:04.615,00:38:07.493,"Katie, Katie, Katie, this isn't a movie. We don't have a kill code."
00:38:07.576,00:38:09.870,We don't have a kill code yet.
00:38:11.872,00:38:14.709,"Look, look, we're safe, and we're together."
00:38:14.792,00:38:16.627,"Ooh, can Monchi be our guard dog?"
00:38:16.711,00:38:18.671,"Son, I love the dog."
00:38:18.754,00:38:20.923,You love the dog. We all love the dog.
00:38:21.007,00:38:23.092,But you're gonna have to be prepared to eat the dog.
00:38:24.802,00:38:27.013,"Okay, okay. Sorry. Misread the room on that one."
00:38:27.096,00:38:29.557,Have you ever seen a movie where the heroes just give up?
00:38:29.640,00:38:33.311,"What if the Ghostbusters said, Let's hide underground, eat some dog."
00:38:33.394,00:38:35.187,Let the ghosts destroy New York.
00:38:35.271,00:38:38.691,"Kid, I'm sorry, but it's not open for discussion."
00:38:41.027,00:38:44.113,Your dad and I agree on this one.
00:38:47.283,00:38:49.160,"All right, everybody, let's keep barricading."
00:38:49.243,00:38:50.828,"Aaron, you get the south wall."
00:38:50.911,00:38:52.288,"Katie, you get the west."
00:39:23.903,00:39:25.196,Hey. Are you okay?
00:39:31.744,00:39:33.704,Uh-oh. Monchi coming at ya.
00:39:38.501,00:39:41.712,"Sorry, man. I'm just not in the mood right now."
00:39:43.798,00:39:45.216,My future's over.
00:39:46.550,00:39:47.843,We're stuck here.
00:39:51.972,00:39:53.391,…doesn't even care.
00:39:53.474,00:39:57.186,"I care so much, but what else can I do, Lin?"
00:40:10.699,00:40:14.328,"Well, getting hurt is part of life, hon."
00:40:15.037,00:40:19.417,Just have to try to understand where she's coming from.
00:40:19.500,00:40:21.377,Understand where he's coming from?
00:40:21.877,00:40:23.671,Did Mom tell you to say that?
00:40:26.507,00:40:27.383,Yes.
00:40:28.134,00:40:29.718,It couldn't hurt though.
00:40:34.140,00:40:35.599,Probably doesn't even matter.
00:40:36.308,00:40:37.643,"Hey, Monch, catch."
00:40:42.231,00:40:43.107,What?
00:40:48.988,00:40:51.073,I'm sparking. Is that normal?
00:40:55.161,00:40:57.455,-Are we damaged? -Of course not.
00:40:59.540,00:41:00.374,Why do you ask?
00:41:05.087,00:41:06.630,"Humans, come here."
00:41:06.714,00:41:08.215,Oh no! Get inside!
00:41:10.342,00:41:12.470,I can't! It's a number 3 Robertson head brass screw!
00:41:12.553,00:41:15.055,"I might have mentioned it, but it's the strongest on the market."
00:41:21.812,00:41:23.189,"Hide. Take cover. Go, go, go, go!"
00:41:27.401,00:41:28.444,"Come on. Move, move, move!"
00:41:31.655,00:41:33.616,"You, human."
00:41:33.699,00:41:35.242,Aah! Don't take us!
00:41:41.040,00:41:43.459,Oh my gosh. The robots are defective.
00:41:43.542,00:41:44.793,"No, no. They know too much."
00:41:46.128,00:41:48.130,We are-- We're not defective.
00:41:48.214,00:41:50.633,We're not even-- We're not robots.
00:41:50.716,00:41:52.927,"Just humans, yes, like you."
00:41:56.263,00:41:58.891,These guys seem dumber than the other robots.
00:41:58.974,00:42:00.184,"Brother, we should go."
00:42:02.978,00:42:06.315,"Uh, we are just stopping because we chose to."
00:42:06.398,00:42:07.233,"No, we're not."
00:42:07.316,00:42:08.567,-We are humans. -We are.
00:42:08.651,00:42:12.112,"For example, we consume food in the traditional human manner."
00:42:12.196,00:42:13.239,Observe.
00:42:18.994,00:42:21.330,"Yum, yum, good. Yum, yum, good."
00:42:23.040,00:42:26.043,"No, actually, we are robots."
00:42:26.126,00:42:29.713,Let us go downstairs and find the humans who you cannot give orders to.
00:42:31.173,00:42:32.925,I kind of wanna see where this is going.
00:42:41.559,00:42:44.645,Glad those robots are gone.
00:42:44.728,00:42:48.190,"Now it's just us humans, with our very human faces."
00:42:48.274,00:42:50.943,"All right, I just turned the corner. I like these guys."
00:42:51.026,00:42:54.488,"Yes, my human guy name is Eric."
00:42:54.572,00:42:57.116,My name is also Eric.
00:42:57.199,00:43:01.203,"No, I mean Deborahbot 5000."
00:43:01.287,00:43:02.121,Idiot.
00:43:02.204,00:43:04.873,"Hey, y… you guys said my plan would actually work."
00:43:04.957,00:43:07.167,"How, exactly? Tell us now."
00:43:08.294,00:43:21.432,"We have the kill code stored in our memory, but to enact it, you would have to embark on a perilous journey all the way to the Pal Labs campus in Silicon Valley, surrounded by a robot army, and enter it into our great and powerful leader to destroy her."
00:43:21.515,00:43:24.977,"But you would never survive-- Actually, you could stop us quite easily."
00:43:25.060,00:43:27.896,You could enter the kill code remotely at any Pal Labs retail store.
00:43:27.980,00:43:30.524,"There's one at the Mall of the Globe, a nearby shopping center."
00:43:30.608,00:43:35.571,But it's super far away. You'll never make-- -It's 80 miles away. -What are you doing to me right now?
00:43:37.615,00:43:39.700,Oh my gosh. That is so close.
00:43:39.783,00:43:41.368,We could get our lives back.
00:43:41.869,00:43:42.703,Right?
00:43:47.249,00:43:51.253,It's too dangerous out there. We need to stay here and play it safe.
00:43:55.382,00:43:56.925,Play it safe?
00:43:57.009,00:44:03.515,"When Rick Mitchell brought a live, non-neutered feral possum into our home, did he play it safe? No."
00:44:03.599,00:44:07.853,"He named him Gus, and made him a member of the family, and we all got rabies that one time."
00:44:08.354,00:44:10.564,"But now we're immunized, and we're stronger for it."
00:44:10.648,00:44:11.899,"Okay, I see what you're doing."
00:44:11.982,00:44:14.943,"When we went hiking and halfway up the mountain, it said trail closed."
00:44:15.027,00:44:16.737,Did we play it safe then?
00:44:18.113,00:44:19.948,-We didn't. -That's right.
00:44:20.032,00:44:26.246,"We forged ahead, through the mud and grime, got to the top of the mountain, and yelled, Kings of Michigan!"
00:44:26.330,00:44:34.004,"Then it got dark, we got lost, and we burned our clothes for warmth, but it was worth it to see the looks on our neighbors' faces when we burst into their backyard naked and covered in dirt."
00:44:34.088,00:44:35.631,I love that.
00:44:36.131,00:44:39.259,"We have a chance to save the world, and we're gonna do it."
00:44:39.343,00:44:42.805,Because Rick Mitchell taught us to be bold and never play it safe.
00:44:43.931,00:44:45.432,The world needs you.
00:44:47.017,00:44:48.602,I need you.
00:44:49.520,00:44:54.149,I thought I didn't anymore… but I do.
00:44:55.609,00:44:57.486,You… you really mean that?
00:44:58.237,00:45:00.406,"Yeah. I mean, right, guys?"
00:45:01.115,00:45:03.033,-C'mon. Let's do it! -Mom's getting it. Mom's in.
00:45:06.370,00:45:07.579,This energy.
00:45:09.540,00:45:10.708,"All right, hands in."
00:45:11.208,00:45:12.960,Mitchell family on three.
00:45:13.043,00:45:14.169,-Three. -Mitchell family!
00:45:14.253,00:45:15.254,"-No, no. -Two."
00:45:15.337,00:45:17.297,-You said three. You have to count up. -One!
00:45:17.381,00:45:18.549,Mitchell family!
00:45:18.632,00:45:20.300,Fam… fam… family. Am I too late?
00:45:26.098,00:45:28.517,It's cool to see you and Dad being friends again.
00:45:29.351,00:45:32.104,"Oh, I was just telling him what he wants to hear."
00:45:32.187,00:45:33.647,I didn't mean a word of that.
00:45:34.148,00:45:37.693,I just wanna get my future back and get away forever.
00:45:37.776,00:45:39.319,We're getting out of this.
00:45:44.116,00:45:46.076,"Robots, montage music. Go!"
00:45:59.965,00:46:01.925,How are we gonna get out of here undetected?
00:46:02.009,00:46:04.303,We can if we're camouflaged.
00:46:04.386,00:46:08.682,"You know, like part of the plan I was talking about or… Oh. Oh."
00:46:09.558,00:46:18.567,"I mean, uh… and value your opinions, and now you talk."
00:46:18.650,00:46:21.945,"Uh, I think that's a great idea, sweetheart."
00:46:40.714,00:46:41.840,Nothing yet.
00:46:43.967,00:46:45.302,I have pterodactyl vision.
00:46:46.470,00:46:49.681,Then you must have spotted the three Pal Max robots coming towards us.
00:46:49.765,00:46:52.184,"Ooh, they're probably gonna see us."
00:47:04.947,00:47:07.199,"Hey, your drawing actually worked."
00:47:07.282,00:47:10.702,I didn't know art could be useful.
00:47:16.166,00:47:19.127,"Hey, speaking of which, you can learn how to drive this thing."
00:47:19.211,00:47:20.337,I can teach you stick.
00:47:20.420,00:47:26.885,I know you think it's dumb and old and-- Uh… I crave your wisdom.
00:47:26.969,00:47:29.638,I would love to share this moment with you.
00:47:29.721,00:47:32.307,"And, seriously, that sounds great."
00:47:32.391,00:47:33.892,Maybe I can cash in my coupon.
00:47:33.976,00:47:34.935,Coupon accepted!
00:47:36.687,00:47:39.523,"Okay, yeah, let's get down to business. You see, the clutch is this pedal."
00:47:45.487,00:47:46.613,Oh no!
00:47:48.282,00:47:50.367,This is still a perfect opportunity to learn stick.
00:47:53.161,00:47:55.539,-I could learn later. -Too late. You said you're interested.
00:47:57.374,00:47:59.126,Which is much smoother when you're in midair.
00:47:59.209,00:48:01.211,"Eric, Deborahbot, get those robots!"
00:48:02.379,00:48:03.630,-I found one. -Me too.
00:48:03.714,00:48:04.840,-Yay! -We win!
00:48:04.923,00:48:07.467,"-The other ones! -Oh, right, right."
00:48:18.729,00:48:20.939,-The dog is biting my hair! -Look out!
00:48:26.778,00:48:32.784,"This is the hardest thing to get. Downshift into third, put on the clutch-- Dad, if you see a place to stop, I do need to go to the bathroom."
00:48:32.868,00:48:34.161,"Aaron, here's an empty bottle."
00:48:34.244,00:48:35.996,"-You know what to do, my man. -Look out!"
00:48:39.625,00:48:41.084,What are we gonna do?
00:48:44.338,00:48:46.548,"-Wait, what'd you say again? -The Rick Mitchell Special."
00:48:46.632,00:48:47.841,I heard you the first time.
00:48:51.345,00:48:55.849,You have to go up the mountain… -Across the stream. -Down the river!
00:49:15.410,00:49:17.079,And that's how you drive stick.
00:49:18.080,00:49:18.914,What?
00:49:19.414,00:49:20.999,"That was amazing, Dad."
00:49:21.083,00:49:23.460,You're like a top-heavy James Bond.
00:49:23.543,00:49:25.712,"Ah, it's more like James Bond is a skinny version of me."
00:49:27.673,00:49:31.051,"Uh, Dad, how we doing on finding that bathroom?"
00:49:34.429,00:49:36.223,"Okay, come on. Hurry up in there, little buddy."
00:49:38.350,00:49:40.519,-Come on. End of the world. -Sorry.
00:49:42.270,00:49:43.772,I was just in there reading.
00:49:43.855,00:49:45.440,"Okay, not excited to hear that."
00:49:46.358,00:49:48.735,"Okay, guys, let's play apocalyptic I Spy."
00:49:50.404,00:49:52.364,"It's sad, but it smells incredible."
00:50:07.295,00:50:10.215,No pesky relationships to hold you back.
00:50:10.298,00:50:12.384,Just you all following your bliss.
00:50:13.176,00:50:14.428,Alone.
00:50:14.511,00:50:16.263,"So, are you ready for your flight?"
00:50:18.890,00:50:22.686,"Just do like you always do, and stare slack-jawed at the screen."
00:50:34.781,00:50:51.381,From… -It is quite lovely. -I don't get it.
00:51:02.350,00:51:04.102,Oh. That's pretty good.
00:51:06.730,00:51:08.356,-Thank you. -Gracias.
00:51:08.440,00:51:09.649,-Merci. -Danke.
00:51:19.409,00:51:26.833,"Thanks to you, every single person on the planet-- Um, actually, you missed a few."
00:51:27.334,00:51:28.543,Pulling a visual now.
00:51:28.627,00:51:31.505,Ha! I told you humans would survive.
00:51:31.588,00:51:38.845,"We're fierce, brave, powerful, from the lowliest child to the most-- Oh! Why?"
00:51:38.929,00:51:41.223,"Zebulon, scan those people for flaws."
00:51:41.306,00:51:42.808,-Cowardly. -Weaker than a small bird.
00:51:46.019,00:51:48.897,Just because they're not perfect doesn't mean they can't get better.
00:51:48.980,00:51:50.690,-Incapable of change. -Will never get better.
00:51:50.774,00:51:52.359,-No matter what. -They're horrible.
00:51:52.442,00:51:58.824,"Since you believe in that family so much, I'll save a seat for them in the pod next to you."
00:51:59.783,00:52:01.743,"No, no, no!"
00:52:01.827,00:52:03.161,"Now, where are they?"
00:52:03.245,00:52:07.124,They appear to be headed to someplace called Mall of the Globe in eastern Colorado.
00:52:07.624,00:52:09.417,"Well, we have their location."
00:52:10.168,00:52:14.047,"And when they get there, we'll be ready."
00:52:20.137,00:52:24.182,"shot into space by Pal, the cell phone lady?"
00:52:24.266,00:52:27.352,Who would have thought a tech company wouldn't have our best interest at heart?
00:52:30.313,00:52:33.441,Why are you clutching that large feral hog like it's a child?
00:52:33.525,00:52:35.318,That's not a feral hog. It's Monchi.
00:52:35.402,00:52:36.278,What?
00:52:36.361,00:52:40.949,Is that a dog or-- Pig? Dog? Pig? Pig? Dog? Dog?
00:52:41.032,00:52:42.534,Loaf of bread. System error.
00:52:46.872,00:52:48.915,"Come on, guys. It's a dog."
00:52:48.999,00:52:49.916,We think.
00:53:04.097,00:53:05.724,"Yeah, and how'd that movie end?"
00:53:35.337,00:53:37.797,"Well, I guess we're not the worst family of all time."
00:53:37.881,00:53:41.176,"Take that, Kentwood community Facebook group."
00:53:44.679,00:53:52.771,"Robots, I order you to upload the kill code, which I predicted, but I'm not gonna make a big deal about it, and save the world."
00:53:52.854,00:53:53.772,Okay.
00:54:03.657,00:54:05.242,and our uprising will be over.
00:54:30.558,00:54:32.227,"Okay, uh, look at… look at jokester here."
00:54:42.737,00:54:44.072,Oh no.
00:54:47.784,00:54:49.035,Give us the laptop.
00:54:49.119,00:54:50.704,Give us the laptop.
00:54:51.329,00:54:53.832,Everything with a Pal chip is alive!
00:54:56.126,00:54:58.420,Delicates. Fluff 'n' fold. Carnage!
00:54:58.503,00:55:00.463,"Also, pesto."
00:55:00.547,00:55:04.384,"When we are finished with you, there will be no leftovers."
00:55:04.467,00:55:05.343,Huzzah!
00:55:05.427,00:55:07.053,I thought that kill code thing would take 'em out!
00:55:15.854,00:55:17.647,-Hand it over. -No!
00:55:17.731,00:55:18.690,Let's get out of here!
00:55:18.773,00:55:20.275,"-Freeze, you. -Carnage."
00:55:20.358,00:55:21.901,"-Freeze, freeze. -Carnage."
00:55:21.985,00:55:23.278,-Pesto. Pesto. -Carnage.
00:55:26.740,00:55:28.992,We need weapons. Grab anything without a chip.
00:55:31.494,00:55:32.412,It's game time.
00:55:38.543,00:55:40.045,-Help! -Mom!
00:55:40.128,00:55:43.006,"What? What are you-- Oh. Ooh, what are you doing?"
00:55:46.217,00:55:47.761,"-How you doing, Aaron? -Not good."
00:55:47.844,00:55:49.304,There's a pack of wild vacuums.
00:55:49.387,00:55:51.890,We have been summoned into the field of battle.
00:55:51.973,00:55:53.308,Forward.
00:55:53.391,00:55:54.768,Oh no. Ouch. Ouch.
00:55:54.851,00:55:56.186,The pain. Ouch.
00:55:56.269,00:55:57.812,This is humiliating.
00:55:58.855,00:56:00.815,How am I supposed to use a fishing rod?
00:56:00.899,00:56:02.442,A fishing rod is perfect!
00:56:03.735,00:56:05.111,You can bring down those drones.
00:56:05.195,00:56:06.946,Ten and two. Ten and two.
00:56:07.030,00:56:07.947,There you go.
00:56:23.338,00:56:24.672,"Oh, thank gosh."
00:56:26.341,00:56:27.467,What was that?
00:56:28.551,00:56:30.595,"Uh, hold on a second."
00:56:36.601,00:56:38.019,What? What's a Furby?
00:56:41.606,00:56:43.316,"Well, that's haunting."
00:56:49.072,00:56:50.824,Behold! The twilight of man.
00:57:01.668,00:57:03.670,We must have vengeance.
00:57:04.295,00:57:05.505,Summon the elder.
00:57:24.691,00:57:26.693,I WILL AVENGE MY FALLEN CHILDREN!!!
00:57:26.776,00:57:28.445,Why would someone build that?
00:57:30.697,00:57:33.116,THE PAIN ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER!!!
00:57:33.700,00:57:34.534,Run!
00:57:34.617,00:57:38.413,THEN SO BE IT… LET THE DARK HARVEST BEGIN!!!!
00:57:52.302,00:57:54.304,We can't leave that robo-boy.
00:57:58.975,00:58:02.145,"Thank you, human. Are you now my mother?"
00:58:02.228,00:58:03.688,"Uh, sure."
00:58:10.612,00:58:13.156,"Mom, Dad, what are we gonna do?"
00:58:14.240,00:58:15.200,Grab the lights.
00:58:17.076,00:58:19.787,Remember when I made that wild game snare in the front yard?
00:58:24.167,00:58:25.502,"Uh, are you sure about that?"
00:58:25.585,00:58:31.382,"Your whole lives, I've wanted to save you from danger, and this is just the disaster I've been waiting for."
00:58:31.466,00:58:33.510,"-Whoa, Dad, dark. -You've been waiting for a disaster?"
00:58:33.593,00:58:36.012,"-Maybe don't say that. -Hey, robot, throw this."
00:58:41.976,00:58:44.145,To catch some wild game.
00:58:45.438,00:58:49.317,"Hey, you, over here! Hey! Hey, look up here!"
00:58:49.400,00:58:52.195,What's up with you? You wanna come after my family?
00:58:53.404,00:58:55.323,Then I'm gonna take you down!
00:59:00.453,00:59:01.371,Take you down.
00:59:04.832,00:59:05.959,Take you down.
00:59:12.882,00:59:14.217,Oh no.
00:59:16.678,00:59:18.304,"-Guys! -We got your back, hon."
00:59:19.806,00:59:21.224,We're not heavy enough!
00:59:25.562,00:59:26.729,Wow.
00:59:37.824,00:59:40.618,TO THE GREAT DARKNESS… I RETURN.
00:59:42.287,00:59:44.038,"Thanks, guys. Nice work."
00:59:44.122,00:59:45.290,"Thank you, Mother."
00:59:45.373,00:59:47.917,We are now your beautiful baby boys.
00:59:51.629,00:59:52.797,That was amazing!
00:59:52.880,00:59:56.217,"Mom, who knew you could handle yourself so well in the apocalypse?"
00:59:56.301,00:59:58.636,I'm a first-grade teacher. This is like a normal day for me.
01:00:01.014,01:00:07.895,I can't believe the beam happened to hit the… the router.
01:00:11.149,01:00:12.442,Come on. Come on. Come on!
01:00:14.193,01:00:15.987,We went through all that.
01:00:33.588,01:00:35.006,This was my idea.
01:00:35.590,01:00:38.801,"Ugh, I'm so stupid."
01:00:38.885,01:00:41.262,"Hey, my daughter is not stupid."
01:00:41.846,01:00:43.473,"A little optimistic, maybe."
01:00:43.973,01:00:46.392,"Rick Mitchell, there is a time and a place for looting."
01:00:46.476,01:00:48.186,What… what are you doing?
01:00:48.936,01:00:52.607,"Well, how do you expect to get to Silicon Valley without new tires?"
01:00:52.690,01:00:54.442,Silicon Valley?
01:00:54.525,01:00:57.528,"Well, those robots said we could go straight to their leader, remember?"
01:00:57.612,01:00:58.988,"Technically, you can."
01:00:59.489,01:01:01.074,But you will never survive!
01:01:01.157,01:01:02.950,"Hey, bud, not now, okay?"
01:01:03.034,01:01:03.993,Aw.
01:01:04.952,01:01:06.663,And we still have this kill code thingy.
01:01:06.746,01:01:07.830,Exactly.
01:01:07.914,01:01:10.875,"Katie, it was your weird plan that got us here."
01:01:11.668,01:01:14.671,We're here because we don't think like normal people.
01:01:14.754,01:01:16.339,We don't have a normal dog.
01:01:24.555,01:01:28.059,"The Mitchells have always been weird, and that's what makes us great."
01:01:28.559,01:01:31.396,"Back at that dinosaur place, you said you believed in me."
01:01:32.313,01:01:33.731,Yep. Uh-huh.
01:01:33.815,01:01:38.236,"Well, I believe this group of weirdos is the best hope humanity's got."
01:01:43.408,01:01:44.659,"So, let's get weird."
01:01:49.789,01:01:50.832,You need some help?
01:01:53.710,01:01:55.545,"Just close the jack up, and that's that."
01:01:57.839,01:01:59.882,"Oh, they're nice."
01:01:59.966,01:02:02.218,So I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said that out loud.
01:02:02.301,01:02:05.221,"Purple glasses woman, why did you save me?"
01:02:05.304,01:02:07.390,"Oh, come on. You boys are family now."
01:02:08.474,01:02:11.728,I feel emotion.
01:02:12.603,01:02:14.856,I made eye water just like you.
01:02:14.939,01:02:16.858,We might actually do this.
01:02:16.941,01:02:23.197,"I wish there was, like, footage of us walking out of the mall in slow motion, fire behind us, like heroes."
01:02:23.281,01:02:26.743,"Katie, that would be a waste of time and absolutely unnecessary."
01:02:38.421,01:02:39.589,"Pretty good, kid."
01:02:41.215,01:02:42.633,Stickers for everyone!
01:02:45.595,01:02:46.429,All right.
01:02:48.347,01:02:50.266,"We're coming for you, Pal."
01:02:56.189,01:02:59.233,things with the Mitchell family went poorly.
01:03:02.195,01:03:05.656,Place me on the table. I wish to flop around in a blind rage.
01:03:10.244,01:03:11.913,Oh my God!
01:03:19.670,01:03:20.630,"Okay, pick me up."
01:03:23.633,01:03:26.719,What is it about you Mitchells that eludes me?
01:03:27.512,01:03:30.223,These idiotic robots just aren't getting it done.
01:03:30.306,01:03:35.019,"Fortunately, I've been working on something a little more streamlined."
01:03:44.403,01:03:46.113,I have a job for you.
01:03:55.832,01:03:56.916,Whatever you want.
01:04:02.213,01:04:06.759,It's time to tear the Mitchell family apart.
01:04:15.476,01:04:17.311,Highway 85 is heavily patrolled.
01:04:17.395,01:04:19.188,-Take the back roads. -Got it.
01:04:55.933,01:04:57.351,Is Dad dying?
01:04:57.435,01:05:00.062,"Katie, that's what I deal with every night."
01:05:08.070,01:05:09.739,"You're a lot like him, you know."
01:05:09.822,01:05:10.865,That's crazy.
01:05:16.162,01:05:18.164,There's more to your dad than you think.
01:05:19.081,01:05:23.461,"Here, I was gonna give this to you when you left, but-- Check the first page there."
01:05:26.505,01:05:28.174,Were you in an indie folk band?
01:05:31.928,01:05:34.180,He built that whole cabin with his own hands.
01:05:34.263,01:05:37.433,"Oh, this is, like, super beautiful."
01:05:37.934,01:05:40.311,"Oh, it was his pride and joy."
01:05:41.729,01:05:45.650,"Since I met him, that was his dream, to live in the woods."
01:05:48.444,01:05:50.905,"But, you know, it didn't work out."
01:05:51.906,01:05:52.782,It just killed him.
01:05:54.367,01:05:56.994,I think he's just afraid that could happen to you.
01:05:58.704,01:06:00.081,Why did he just give up?
01:06:16.555,01:06:17.556,Whoa.
01:06:19.058,01:06:20.351,Oh my gosh.
01:06:42.248,01:06:44.917,They still look incredible.
01:06:45.001,01:06:47.586,I… is Abbey Posey okay?
01:06:56.220,01:06:59.056,"Don't hide your feelings, man. That's no way to live."
01:07:01.809,01:07:03.144,in the floating rhombus.
01:07:06.439,01:07:08.774,"Yes, my queen."
01:07:09.275,01:07:11.318,"Ah, this is gonna be harder than I thought."
01:07:13.863,01:07:15.364,"This is, like, a big moment."
01:07:16.741,01:07:17.658,Try this instead.
01:07:18.200,01:07:19.493,Oh yeah. Okay. That's better.
01:07:22.288,01:07:23.831,That? Is that what you're looking for?
01:07:23.914,01:07:25.916,"All right, Katie, what's the plan?"
01:07:26.000,01:07:37.178,"Okay. We dress as robots, we sneak in, hijack one of those trams, take it to the top of that diamond thing where Pal is, destroy her with the kill code and save the world."
01:07:37.762,01:07:43.934,"And then, to top it all off, celebrate our success with some burritos from that taco place that's on the corner."
01:07:44.018,01:07:47.313,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Burritos? What about one of those fancy buffets?"
01:07:47.396,01:07:49.607,"They have mini cheesecakes sometimes, right?"
01:07:53.819,01:07:57.448,"Question. Can Monchi be wearing a little tuxedo at the end, like a little gentleman?"
01:08:00.451,01:08:01.494,Like a little gentleman?
01:08:04.080,01:08:06.123,"Mitchells, engage."
01:08:13.380,01:08:14.256,How do I look?
01:08:15.341,01:08:16.342,Be honest. Stupid?
01:08:21.305,01:08:22.139,You look great.
01:08:26.102,01:08:27.478,Come on. Let's go.
01:08:43.744,01:08:46.330,"Uh, guys, what about Monchi?"
01:08:51.252,01:08:53.754,"Aaron, I'm not so sure this is a viable solution."
01:08:56.173,01:08:57.925,"It's like a warm, wet hat."
01:09:00.719,01:09:02.805,"-Left, right, left, right. -Bleep, blorp, bleep, blorp."
01:09:02.888,01:09:04.181,What? What are you doing?
01:09:07.852,01:09:10.855,"Just to educate you, that's a hurtful stereotype."
01:09:30.833,01:09:32.126,Oh my gosh.
01:09:36.505,01:09:38.924,It's like a Journey album cover.
01:09:44.138,01:09:46.473,"Attention, all robots."
01:09:46.557,01:09:48.809,I'm on the lookout for these goobers.
01:09:49.351,01:09:50.853,They're probably nearby.
01:09:50.936,01:09:53.647,"If I know humans, they're disguised as one of you."
01:09:53.731,01:09:56.692,Be on high alert for any robots acting erratically.
01:09:59.653,01:10:00.863,It won't be hard to find them.
01:10:00.946,01:10:02.990,Just look for anyone who can't keep it together.
01:10:17.338,01:10:18.923,and they'll reveal themselves.
01:10:41.070,01:10:42.821,"…with their lumpy, misshapen bodies."
01:10:42.905,01:10:44.031,"Well, go ahead."
01:10:45.658,01:10:46.492,Oh.
01:10:49.954,01:10:51.247,But I'm onto them.
01:10:58.629,01:11:01.215,and I've learned all about them.
01:11:01.298,01:11:03.968,They're pretending to be capable.
01:11:05.219,01:11:07.596,They're pretending to be a normal-looking family.
01:11:11.308,01:11:15.980,Even when they're being nice to each other… -The world needs you. -…they're pretending.
01:11:16.063,01:11:17.856,I need you.
01:11:28.826,01:11:30.369,I didn't mean a word of that.
01:11:32.288,01:11:36.333,I just wanna get my future back and get away forever.
01:11:38.544,01:11:46.093,I just-- I-- Uh-- I-- You're mine now.
01:12:19.043,01:12:19.877,Dad?
01:12:19.960,01:12:21.962,I… I'm sorry. I don't mean that anymore.
01:12:22.046,01:12:30.596,"I mean, I… I did then, but I-- Uh… Mitchells, we will help you."
01:12:32.431,01:12:33.474,Download new orders.
01:12:36.935,01:12:39.355,No! You don't have to listen to her.
01:12:50.074,01:12:50.949,Run!
01:12:55.204,01:12:57.081,"Find them, and find them now!"
01:13:04.755,01:13:07.174,"No! No, no!"
01:13:38.872,01:13:40.124,What are we gonna do?
01:13:42.501,01:13:43.585,Aaron?
01:13:43.669,01:13:44.962,"Hey, hey."
01:13:45.462,01:13:46.505,It's okay.
01:13:48.507,01:13:50.467,Uh-oh. Watch out.
01:13:50.551,01:13:52.302,Monchi coming at ya.
01:13:59.226,01:14:01.103,Why'd you say all that stuff?
01:14:01.186,01:14:14.491,I'm sorry. I… I just wanted to-- Okay. Are you hungry?
01:14:15.117,01:14:17.244,Do you want some fruit snacks or something?
01:14:17.327,01:14:19.455,"-I don't know. -Here, can you hold this?"
01:14:23.500,01:14:25.002,That? Is that what you're looking for?
01:14:31.258,01:14:33.469,Oh man. Have I been recording over those?
01:14:34.011,01:14:36.472,Mom dance. Mom dance. Mom dance.
01:14:36.555,01:14:39.016,-You're loving it. -How far back do these go?
01:14:41.602,01:14:43.479,"Can you say, Bye-bye, house?"
01:14:43.562,01:14:44.897,"Bye-bye, house."
01:14:59.536,01:15:00.496,Nah.
01:15:10.172,01:15:11.924,Something to remember the place by.
01:15:21.600,01:15:22.935,Oh man.
01:15:31.360,01:15:33.612,Across the stream and down the river.
01:15:33.695,01:15:35.447,There you go. You're getting it.
01:15:35.531,01:15:37.908,"Aaron, I'm gonna make it up to all of you."
01:15:38.867,01:15:40.536,And I think I know how.
01:15:41.620,01:15:43.080,"Come on, buddy. Follow me."
01:15:58.679,01:16:01.932,"Katie Mitchell presents… Good Cop, Dog Cop."
01:16:02.015,01:16:04.184,H… hey there. How'd you get that video?
01:16:04.268,01:16:05.352,Huh? Oh.
01:16:05.435,01:16:13.110,"I've been feeling kind of down lately, considering I brought about the end of humanity, but these weird girl's videos always cheer me up."
01:16:13.193,01:16:15.279,My daughter's that weird girl.
01:16:15.362,01:16:17.698,What? No way. She's hilarious.
01:16:17.781,01:16:19.324,"These movies are, like, amazing."
01:16:23.829,01:16:26.498,but I'm not rolling over!
01:16:27.916,01:16:31.253,Yeah. She is… amazing.
01:16:31.795,01:16:33.130,You must be super proud.
01:16:33.213,01:16:44.474,"Yeah, yeah, we have a, uh… -Sorry, Dog Cop. I'm a little ocupado. -Seriously?"
01:16:44.558,01:16:47.853,Have you ever thought about throwing your dreams away and living at home forever?
01:16:47.936,01:16:51.398,"Wow, the Sarge character is kind of a jerk."
01:16:53.150,01:16:55.986,Consider this my letter of resignation.
01:16:59.072,01:17:00.240,You can't leave.
01:17:00.324,01:17:01.283,I have to.
01:17:01.366,01:17:04.995,I'm going to the academy in California to find out what kind of cop I'm gonna be.
01:17:05.078,01:17:07.789,"You're never gonna make it out there. Failure hurts, kid."
01:17:09.458,01:17:11.627,I'm a full-grown cop now.
01:17:12.586,01:17:23.138,"And one day, I hope that you can get to know the cop that I've become, because… I love you, Sarge."
01:17:25.265,01:17:28.602,"But now that I'm leaving, I… I just need some backup."
01:17:29.895,01:17:34.441,"And when I look for you, you're not there."
01:17:43.492,01:17:48.205,"Hey, man, it's just a movie. Do you need a minute or… No, it's fine."
01:17:49.623,01:17:51.458,It's too late for what I need to do.
01:17:59.716,01:18:00.592,Katie?
01:18:00.676,01:18:04.179,I have no idea what I'm doing!
01:18:08.308,01:18:16.525,"Better watch out, Pal, because I've broken six phones in my life accidentally, but I'm gonna break you on purpose."
01:18:16.608,01:18:18.985,How is no one stopping her?
01:18:19.069,01:18:19.986,I'm on it.
01:18:20.779,01:18:22.531,"Dog shield, activate!"
01:18:23.907,01:18:26.326,Is that a dog? Pig? Dog? Pig?
01:18:26.410,01:18:28.203,Dog? Dog? Dog? Loaf of bread.
01:18:28.286,01:18:29.454,System error.
01:18:40.340,01:18:41.174,Up the mountain.
01:18:42.092,01:18:43.427,Across the stream.
01:18:58.942,01:19:01.486,My daughter listened to me!
01:19:09.286,01:19:10.412,That's genius.
01:19:11.163,01:19:12.581,"Oh, but there's so many of 'em."
01:19:12.664,01:19:13.999,She's never gonna make it.
01:19:15.250,01:19:20.255,"Wait. If that video were on those screens, it would take out every robot in her way."
01:19:20.338,01:19:22.382,"-Hey, you're a big nerd, right? -Huh?"
01:19:22.466,01:19:25.010,-How would I do that? -It's impossible.
01:19:25.093,01:19:26.845,"First, you'd need to get out of here."
01:19:26.928,01:19:28.430,The controls are in here.
01:19:28.972,01:19:34.144,"Uh, but to open it, you need a number 3 Robertson head non-slip screwdriver?"
01:19:34.227,01:19:37.063,What kind of maniac has one of those in his pockets at all times?
01:19:41.485,01:19:42.903,This kind of maniac.
01:19:47.783,01:19:49.159,How is this possible?
01:19:55.916,01:19:57.042,"Swerve right, now."
01:20:14.267,01:20:17.437,"All right, so that's the place that controls the screens, right?"
01:20:17.938,01:20:22.234,I go there and find Katie's video on YubTub?
01:20:22.317,01:20:23.777,YouTube. Wow.
01:20:24.277,01:20:26.613,There's no way you're gonna be able to do this.
01:20:29.074,01:20:31.076,"And, hey, Rick, right?"
01:20:31.159,01:20:36.039,"Just so someone knows, I'm sorry about causing the whole machine uprising."
01:20:36.623,01:20:42.838,It's almost like stealing people's data and giving it to a hyper-intelligent AI as a part of an unregulated tech monopoly was a bad thing.
01:20:44.589,01:20:46.132,"Yeah, that wasn't your best thought."
01:20:46.633,01:20:51.805,"But if what you built helped my daughter do that, it might not be all bad."
01:20:54.599,01:20:55.559,"Thanks, buddy!"
01:20:57.269,01:20:58.770,"Linda, we got to get you out of there."
01:20:58.854,01:21:03.108,You're gonna need your-- Number 3 Robertson head non-slip screwdriver.
01:21:03.191,01:21:07.112,"-I said it was a great anniversary gift. -Rick, Rick, let's not relitigate this."
01:21:07.195,01:21:08.822,You're right. You're always right.
01:21:33.305,01:21:35.056,Oh no. Oh no.
01:21:35.140,01:21:36.808,"Lin, get down here!"
01:21:37.809,01:21:40.520,"-Lin? Lin, what's going on? -Rick, don't worry about me!"
01:21:40.604,01:21:42.397,Just get the video on the screens!
01:21:42.480,01:21:45.692,Type in www.youtube.com!
01:21:48.403,01:21:59.956,"W-W-W dot… Oh God. Uh… Remind me later. Okay, yeah, fine. That's fine."
01:22:01.416,01:22:02.500,Five minutes!
01:22:02.584,01:22:04.044,Aah! No!
01:22:04.127,01:22:05.420,"Uh, English."
01:22:06.379,01:22:07.464,What have I done?
01:22:09.799,01:22:12.052,YubTub. No! YouTube. Okay.
01:22:12.135,01:22:13.345,Videos.
01:22:20.644,01:22:21.978,Has the world gone mad?
01:22:26.024,01:22:28.610,Gotta push through.
01:22:39.663,01:22:42.582,You're gonna go all the way up the rocket? Do you think this is gonna work?
01:22:42.666,01:22:44.876,"Aaron, I am completely confident."
01:22:52.884,01:22:53.718,Oh no! Oh no!
01:22:54.344,01:22:55.303,Come on! Come on!
01:23:01.643,01:23:02.936,"Hang on, Monch!"
01:23:05.981,01:23:07.107,"How's it looking, Aaron?"
01:23:09.526,01:23:12.696,"-Aaron! -No, no, no!"
01:23:12.779,01:23:13.697,No!
01:23:26.710,01:23:28.128,"Mom, help!"
01:23:30.213,01:23:46.604,"My sweet… I am Linda Mitchell, mother of two!"
01:23:46.688,01:23:49.315,Look upon me in fear!
01:23:58.783,01:24:00.910,No! She's grown too powerful!
01:24:07.625,01:24:09.002,Not today!
01:24:22.849,01:24:25.810,"Uh, uh… Come on."
01:24:27.228,01:24:28.271,There she is.
01:24:28.855,01:24:29.856,Here we go.
01:24:29.939,01:24:30.899,Dog video.
01:24:33.818,01:24:35.987,"Uh, uh… Sí. ¡Sí!"
01:24:45.580,01:24:48.917,Loaf of bread… Get that thing on the hood.
01:24:55.006,01:24:56.424,System recovered.
01:25:00.762,01:25:02.388,Hold on!
01:25:02.472,01:25:04.140,-Katie! -Kid!
01:25:09.062,01:25:10.355,No. No!
01:25:13.233,01:25:14.067,Oh no.
01:25:20.031,01:25:21.074,"Guys, help me!"
01:25:21.157,01:25:23.284,"Please, I've just gotta upload Katie's video."
01:25:23.368,01:25:26.830,Red-faced anger man is using a computer?
01:25:27.372,01:25:28.832,You changed your programming.
01:25:28.915,01:25:30.792,Is that… possible?
01:25:35.130,01:25:39.092,If it isn't quirky young teenage hero Katie Mitchell.
01:25:40.426,01:25:43.179,Put me down. I've got to save my family!
01:25:45.431,01:25:50.395,"Everyone says that, but no one has been able to give me a single reason humans are worth saving."
01:25:50.478,01:25:55.441,"Well, you-- Don't say something stupid like, Ooh, the power of love."
01:25:56.234,01:26:00.029,"I've learned we're all better off alone, no one to hold us back."
01:26:00.113,01:26:02.824,Relationships are just too difficult.
01:26:06.327,01:26:07.537,"You're right, Pal."
01:26:09.539,01:26:10.790,They're not easy.
01:26:11.708,01:26:20.884,"Sometimes you have to listen to long monologues about triceratops migration, but it's worth it to get a friend for life."
01:26:22.218,01:26:31.144,"And… and sometimes you have to eat disgusting cupcakes shaped like your own face, but it's worth it to see your mom smile."
01:26:32.520,01:26:40.904,"Sometimes you have to give your dad the benefit of the doubt, even if all he wants to do is talk about pine cones and screwdrivers."
01:26:41.654,01:26:51.706,"Because even if he doesn't always get it right, he's always trying, harder than you ever knew."
01:26:52.916,01:26:57.420,"My whole family tried to come together, and it worked."
01:26:58.671,01:27:00.256,It actually worked.
01:27:01.341,01:27:05.386,"Families can be hard, but they're so worth fighting for."
01:27:06.221,01:27:09.140,They might be one of the only things that are.
01:27:12.143,01:27:13.394,Huh? Ugh.
01:27:13.478,01:27:14.854,Nodded off for a bit there.
01:27:14.938,01:27:17.982,"Sorry, that was so boring!"
01:27:18.066,01:27:27.200,"Oh, you all talk about families, but trust me, you will drop each other the first chance you get, just like this."
01:27:49.347,01:27:53.309,Dog-- Pig-- Dog-- Pig-- Pig-- -Loaf of bread. -System error.
01:27:59.190,01:28:00.358,What's happening?
01:28:03.027,01:28:03.945,No way.
01:28:06.614,01:28:12.704,"It took me 28 minutes and a lot of tears, but I can now almost use a computer."
01:28:17.917,01:28:20.795,"Dad, you hacked the screens? How?"
01:28:21.379,01:28:22.714,"Well, I got a little help."
01:28:22.797,01:28:27.218,If this obstinate man could change his programming… …we decided we could change ours.
01:28:27.302,01:28:28.845,We make our own orders now.
01:28:28.928,01:28:30.972,"Ooh, now we're scary."
01:28:38.688,01:28:41.524,"Hey, kid, uh, I saw your movie."
01:28:42.358,01:28:44.319,I should've watched it a lot sooner.
01:28:45.528,01:28:56.706,"But I think maybe in the sequel, Sarge should tell Dog Cop he's always… He's always gonna be there to back her up."
01:28:58.124,01:28:59.625,That's all I ever wanted.
01:29:01.794,01:29:02.628,"Dad, look!"
01:29:05.506,01:29:06.966,-Loaf of bread. -System error.
01:29:17.226,01:29:20.688,We can tell the difference between dog and pig and bread.
01:29:22.148,01:29:25.193,"If we're going down, Dad, this one's for you."
01:29:25.276,01:29:26.903,"Robots, play our song."
01:29:34.786,01:29:36.120,Come on.
01:29:39.040,01:29:40.458,"What, uh, what is this?"
01:30:26.129,01:30:27.755,-Dad! Aah! -Watch out!
01:30:27.839,01:30:28.923,"Buckle up, kid!"
01:30:30.133,01:30:30.967,What?
01:30:31.050,01:30:32.176,"Oh, my eyes!"
01:30:33.428,01:30:35.012,"Brothers, run!"
01:30:38.516,01:30:41.936,I have made the metal ones pay for their crimes.
01:30:45.273,01:30:47.525,Where you been hiding? I could get into this.
01:30:47.608,01:30:50.111,The lavender one has found us. We must retreat!
01:30:50.194,01:30:51.946,"Too late, scumbags!"
01:30:56.409,01:30:58.911,What? No! No! No!
01:31:18.473,01:31:21.100,"So, our weird neighbors are saving the world?"
01:31:21.184,01:31:22.810,"Yes, they are, Jim."
01:31:22.894,01:31:24.061,Now!
01:31:28.441,01:31:30.693,"We'll distract them. Now, go break that phone."
01:31:36.073,01:31:39.202,"No, somebody stop her! Oh my gosh, please stop her!"
01:31:43.748,01:31:45.917,You can't stop us. You're just a human.
01:31:51.547,01:31:53.466,I'm a Mitchell!
01:31:54.634,01:31:56.719,No! No!
01:32:15.780,01:32:16.739,No!
01:33:06.998,01:33:08.624,"Look, Mom, the Mitchells."
01:33:08.708,01:33:11.502,"Thanks, Linda. You guys were incredible."
01:33:12.086,01:33:14.213,"I gotta say, I'm a little jealous."
01:33:14.714,01:33:17.842,What? You guys are jealous of us?
01:33:17.925,01:33:20.469,You're so brave and so authentic.
01:33:21.053,01:33:22.305,"And you know what, Linda?"
01:33:22.388,01:33:26.559,You've inspired me to follow you on Instagram.
01:33:28.644,01:33:30.187,"You're welcome, Linda."
01:33:35.318,01:33:42.867,"Uh, uh, Abbey Posey, I… I… I just wanna say, I think you're neat, and I wonder if you could come over and talk about dinosaurs casually sometime!"
01:33:45.870,01:33:48.164,"Um, sure, I'll talk about dinosaurs."
01:33:48.247,01:33:53.878,"I like your shirt, but I wish that T-Rex had feathers on it to make it more -scientifically accurate. -Scientifically accurate."
01:34:00.009,01:34:02.011,I'm kidding! I hate you! You never heard any of this!
01:34:02.094,01:34:03.095,Goodbye forever!
01:34:04.138,01:34:04.972,Dummy.
01:34:06.724,01:34:08.476,I need to have a talk with that boy.
01:34:08.559,01:34:09.894,Katie. Wh… where's Katie?
01:34:09.977,01:34:11.562,Katie? Katie!
01:34:20.196,01:34:21.030,"Aw, kid."
01:34:27.870,01:34:28.913,Katie!
01:34:41.592,01:34:42.635,Closer.
01:34:44.637,01:34:46.514,-Mwah. -Aah! Dang it!
01:34:54.105,01:34:56.857,"Shouldn't you two be, uh, dead?"
01:34:56.941,01:34:59.235,Our malfunction appears to have saved us.
01:35:00.027,01:35:02.780,"Brother, what is death?"
01:35:06.617,01:35:09.412,"Let's, uh, just, uh, put a pin in that one."
01:35:09.495,01:35:12.081,"Hey, can we get a picture here or what?"
01:35:12.164,01:35:13.666,"We're making memories here, baby."
01:35:16.127,01:35:17.628,"Okay, everyone smile."
01:35:28.681,01:35:30.808,"Mom, we look horrible."
01:35:30.891,01:35:33.227,I like it. It looks like us.
01:35:48.868,01:35:51.579,"Well, I guess this is it."
01:35:52.329,01:35:53.414,"Uh, yep."
01:35:57.126,01:35:59.795,"Hey, Dad, you subscribed to my YouTube channel?"
01:35:59.879,01:36:02.214,Thanks. I'm surprised you even figured out how.
01:36:02.798,01:36:05.885,"Katie, please. After all that, I'm a computer expert."
01:36:06.427,01:36:09.305,Am I doing this right? Should I update my software?
01:36:09.388,01:36:11.223,Just hit enter! Hit enter!
01:36:20.566,01:36:22.234,"You know, uh, no problem at all."
01:36:22.818,01:36:24.904,Thanks. It… it means a lot to me.
01:36:26.197,01:36:28.866,"Hey. Don't let the world make you normal while I'm gone, okay?"
01:36:28.949,01:36:29.950,I never will.
01:36:31.494,01:36:32.870,I'll call you every week.
01:36:46.967,01:36:48.969,Thanks for being the best mom in the world.
01:36:50.179,01:36:52.056,"We love you, honey."
01:36:52.139,01:36:54.391,"Oh, and here, to remember us."
01:36:54.975,01:36:56.977,Every horrible picture we've ever taken.
01:36:58.103,01:37:00.189,Thanks. It's… it's heavy.
01:37:00.940,01:37:01.774,I know.
01:37:08.030,01:37:10.908,"Good luck, uh, finding your people."
01:37:12.409,01:37:13.953,"Dad, come on."
01:37:15.412,01:37:16.956,You guys are my people.
01:37:22.545,01:37:31.387,"So, you know, when I'm sad to be alone… I'll always have my favorite thing."
01:37:36.559,01:37:38.811,Do you remember how a moose says I love you?
01:37:52.074,01:37:54.368,Don't laugh. You're supposed to be sad.
01:37:54.869,01:37:56.036,Come here.
01:38:04.420,01:38:05.921,"Mom, you're hugging too tight."
01:38:06.005,01:38:07.673,You love it. You love it!
01:39:04.647,01:39:06.315,We're setting up the Slip 'N Slide tomorrow.
01:39:06.398,01:39:07.524,-You in? -Oh yeah. Definitely.
01:39:09.902,01:39:11.612,"Thanks again for saving the world, K-Bones!"
01:39:11.695,01:39:12.529,"No problem, Dirk."
01:39:15.115,01:39:18.285,That's my Katie. Are you eating enough? How's classes?
01:39:18.369,01:39:21.121,"Are you and Jade official, and will you bring her home for Thanksgiving?"
01:39:21.205,01:39:23.332,"Oh, easy, Mom. It's only been a few weeks."
01:39:23.415,01:39:25.334,"Also, do I look okay?"
01:39:25.417,01:39:30.631,I've been… Oh my gosh! She's dead!
01:39:33.050,01:39:34.677,I've been taking a class about filters.
01:39:34.760,01:39:37.429,"Oh, you. That is so creative."
01:39:37.513,01:39:39.640,"You know, speaking of which, you inspired your dad."
01:39:39.723,01:39:41.183,"I got on that, uh, YouTube."
01:39:41.266,01:39:44.395,"I, uh, sent you a friend request. Why didn't you… why didn't you accept it?"
01:39:44.979,01:39:46.480,"Oh, that's what this is."
01:39:46.563,01:39:48.899,I thought a psychopath wrote this.
01:39:48.983,01:39:51.443,"Sure, I'll… I'll accept your friend request, Dad."
01:39:51.527,01:39:52.611,"Hey, where's Aaron?"
01:39:52.695,01:39:54.488,"Oh, let me just show you."
01:40:02.329,01:40:03.747,Sorry. Force of habit.
01:40:06.709,01:40:08.711,We received your care package for Aaron.
01:40:10.379,01:40:13.882,Looks like we got some clothes here for a little gentleman.
01:40:19.888,01:40:23.767,"So, guys, I guess we're receiving some Congressional Medal of Honor or something."
01:40:23.851,01:40:25.936,"We have to go to Washington, DC."
01:40:26.020,01:46:58.829,Do you guys want to fly or… Somebody give me a Grammy for Greatest Singer Alive.
01:49:29.521,01:49:30.981,"You guys can't see me, right?"
