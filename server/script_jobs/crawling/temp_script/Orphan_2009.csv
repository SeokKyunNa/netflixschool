00:01:55.532,00:01:56.867,Uh?
00:02:06.710,00:02:08.420,NURSE: Vitals look good.
00:02:08.420,00:02:11.090,Mmm. Mmm.

00:02:13.258,00:02:15.761,Where's my husband?
00:02:15.761,00:02:17.387,Everything's gonna be okay.
00:02:19.014,00:02:20.599,Ah.
00:02:23.894,00:02:26.396,What's happening? What's...?
00:02:26.396,00:02:27.856,I'm so sorry for your loss.
00:02:27.856,00:02:30.191,What?
00:02:30.191,00:02:32.486,"No, it's not dead."
00:02:32.486,00:02:34.571,What are you talking about?
00:02:34.571,00:02:36.949,It's a terrible loss.
00:02:37.866,00:02:41.495,Just relax.
00:02:41.495,00:02:44.581,"What? No, no, no. Put me to sleep. I wanna be asleep."
00:02:44.581,00:02:47.208,It's too late for that.
00:02:51.797,00:02:53.966,"It's okay, you're doing great."
00:02:53.966,00:02:56.135,"Oh, what are you doing?"
00:02:56.135,00:02:58.053,DOCTOR: You might feel some tugging.
00:03:00.806,00:03:03.809,Ah!
00:03:03.809,00:03:06.645,"Oh, my God."
00:03:06.645,00:03:08.022,Oh!
00:03:08.022,00:03:10.024,"Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman."
00:04:27.434,00:04:31.230,"WOMAN: Yes, Kate, your dreams can be a manifestation of your emotions."
00:04:31.230,00:04:35.859,It's your body and mind's way of dealing with the stress and grief of what happened.
00:04:35.859,00:04:38.779,"Mmm, what if this has nothing to do with the stillbirth?"
00:04:38.779,00:04:40.906,What do you think it's about?
00:04:42.407,00:04:45.410,We're seeing kids for the first time this weekend.
00:04:45.410,00:04:49.081,"And maybe the nightmares, uhm..."
00:04:52.667,00:04:56.213,Maybe I'm just not ready to adopt yet.
00:05:01.843,00:05:05.764,I drove by the wine shop on the way home the other night.
00:05:07.099,00:05:08.516,Did you stop?
00:05:08.516,00:05:10.144,No. Wanted to.
00:05:10.144,00:05:12.437,"Mmm, the thought went through my... my brain, you know?"
00:05:12.437,00:05:14.606,It wasn't for myself.
00:05:14.606,00:05:18.777,"It just... I just thought it would be nice to have a bottle handy, in case we had guests."
00:05:18.777,00:05:20.154,But you didn't go in.
00:05:22.739,00:05:24.158,Mm-mm.
00:05:24.158,00:05:29.454,"The key, to me is not that you had the urge Mmm."
00:05:29.454,00:05:31.248,but that you resisted it.
00:05:31.248,00:05:34.835,"Trust me, you wouldn't have made it through the home study if you weren't ready."
00:05:34.835,00:05:36.461,"But, ultimately..."
00:05:36.461,00:05:39.089,you have to decide.
00:05:39.089,00:05:41.800,"WOMAN: Hi, girls."
00:06:02.279,00:06:04.031,Hi.

00:06:08.451,00:06:12.080,Let me see. Oh!
00:06:12.080,00:06:16.001,It's a beautiful butterfly.
00:06:16.001,00:06:18.337,Really wonderful. Good.
00:06:18.337,00:06:20.214,Let's go. I'm cold.
00:06:20.214,00:06:21.340,Brrr.
00:06:50.035,00:06:51.995,Are you okay?
00:08:01.606,00:08:03.608,Arg.
00:08:17.497,00:08:18.873,Max!
00:08:18.873,00:08:20.708,Max!
00:08:20.708,00:08:22.585,Stop throwing!
00:08:22.585,00:08:25.505,I'm working.
00:08:25.505,00:08:27.841,"No, honey, I-- I'm sorry."
00:08:27.841,00:08:30.510,"Just take a break for a little while, okay?"
00:08:30.510,00:08:33.805,Because Mommy's trying to play. Okay?
00:08:36.891,00:08:37.934,WOMAN: Oh!
00:08:37.934,00:08:39.978,Daddy's here.
00:08:43.315,00:08:45.984,BOY: Mine.
00:08:45.984,00:08:47.152,Hi.
00:08:47.152,00:08:48.653,"Sorry, practice went a little late."
00:08:48.653,00:08:50.655,WOMAN: It's all right.
00:08:51.948,00:08:55.118,"Okay, tough guy. Give me that."
00:08:55.118,00:08:56.328,Mmm. Uh.
00:08:56.328,00:08:57.745,"No, no."
00:08:57.745,00:09:00.374,"JOHN: Shoot it, shoot it."
00:09:00.374,00:09:04.294,No.
00:09:04.294,00:09:06.463,"Hey, how did it go?"
00:09:06.463,00:09:08.173,Fine.
00:09:13.011,00:09:15.055,Hey.
00:09:15.889,00:09:17.307,Okay.
00:09:17.307,00:09:19.017,DANIEL: Five minutes.
00:09:19.017,00:09:21.102,JOHN: No more video games.
00:09:21.102,00:09:23.771,DANIEL: That's no fair. It won't save.
00:11:49.708,00:11:51.961,Ah! Mmm.
00:11:51.961,00:11:54.464,"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
00:11:57.842,00:12:00.094,Mmm.
00:12:00.094,00:12:02.514,Mmm.
00:12:08.645,00:12:10.980,Oh.
00:12:14.234,00:12:15.943,Okay.
00:12:17.070,00:12:19.197,All right.
00:12:22.659,00:12:26.204,I have to stop being like this.
00:12:26.204,00:12:28.081,I get it.
00:12:36.047,00:12:40.427,"I'm very excited, I'm happy."
00:12:40.427,00:12:42.721,I get nervous.
00:12:43.430,00:12:45.473,I'm really scared.
00:12:48.643,00:12:53.814,Last time I felt all of this was right before I lost the baby.
00:12:53.814,00:12:57.444,I don't want you to feel like we have to go through with this for my sake.
00:12:57.444,00:12:59.820,It's not just-- It's not for you.
00:12:59.820,00:13:01.197,I... I...
00:13:01.197,00:13:07.412,I wanna take the love we felt for Jessica and I wanna give it to somebody who really needs it.
00:13:10.582,00:13:12.751,"Are you sure, hon?"
00:13:15.253,00:13:17.088,Yes.
00:13:38.151,00:13:41.195,GIRL: Wanna make a snowman?
00:13:41.195,00:13:42.821,GIRL: It's really cold out here.
00:13:50.163,00:13:51.331,"GIRL: Hey, stop it."
00:13:58.463,00:14:00.340,Hi.
00:14:00.340,00:14:01.758,So glad you could make it.
00:14:01.758,00:14:04.093,So are we.
00:14:05.428,00:14:08.264,So good to see you.
00:14:08.264,00:14:09.599,Oh.
00:14:09.599,00:14:10.725,This is really something.
00:14:10.725,00:14:12.560,NUN: So go take a look around.
00:14:12.560,00:14:15.730,Stay out of trouble.
00:14:19.025,00:14:20.485,Look at the snow orphan.
00:14:20.485,00:14:21.986,Snow orphan?
00:14:21.986,00:14:23.738,"Well, snorphan?"
00:14:34.582,00:14:36.083,GIRL: Hey.
00:14:36.083,00:14:39.086,"WOMAN: No, show it to Sister Mary."
00:15:01.609,00:15:05.196,"NUN: Slow down, slow down."
00:15:05.196,00:15:06.447,"GIRL 2: Yes, I can."
00:15:33.850,00:15:35.769,GIRL: Hello?
00:15:40.106,00:15:41.107,Hi.
00:15:55.622,00:15:57.498,Are all these paintings yours?
00:15:57.498,00:16:01.461,GIRL: Yes. Do you like them?
00:16:02.128,00:16:03.546,Thank you.
00:16:03.546,00:16:06.633,My name is Esther.
00:16:06.633,00:16:09.761,John. Nice to meet you.
00:16:10.845,00:16:13.681,Can I take a seat?
00:16:15.391,00:16:18.603,I never get tired of watching these kids enjoy the party.
00:16:18.603,00:16:21.397,It really is. I'm so sorry we didn't do this sooner.
00:16:21.397,00:16:23.399,Don't be. It's a big leap.
00:16:23.399,00:16:27.737,Adopting an older child is not an easy decision to make.
00:16:29.155,00:16:30.782,John's in the bathroom.
00:16:30.782,00:16:32.867,You think he'll find us? Or do you wanna go look for him?
00:16:32.867,00:16:34.661,Where did you get the idea for this one?
00:16:34.661,00:16:37.872,My paintings always tell stories.
00:16:37.872,00:16:41.501,This one's about a sad mother lion who can't find her cubs.
00:16:41.501,00:16:42.877,She's smiling.
00:16:42.877,00:16:45.004,She's dreaming about her babies.
00:16:45.004,00:16:47.423,It's the only thing that makes her happy.
00:16:47.423,00:16:51.928,I hope she finds them.
00:16:54.681,00:17:00.770,"They were lost in the jungle, and they were so scared because they didn't have a mother or father."
00:17:00.770,00:17:07.067,But just when they thought they'd be alone forever they found their mother asleep under this tree.
00:17:07.067,00:17:10.780,"Now when she wakes up, her dream will have come true."
00:17:10.780,00:17:12.323,She'll have her family again.
00:17:12.323,00:17:14.074,It's amazing. You came up with that story?
00:17:14.074,00:17:16.285,"WOMAN: Yeah, I think I hear his voice down here."
00:17:16.285,00:17:18.287,Yes.
00:17:18.287,00:17:21.916,Hey. I want to introduce you.
00:17:21.916,00:17:23.543,"Kate, this is Esther."
00:17:24.878,00:17:26.337,Hello.
00:17:28.130,00:17:31.175,How are you?
00:17:32.051,00:17:34.303,She painted all these.
00:17:34.303,00:17:35.847,Really?
00:17:35.847,00:17:38.599,These are fantastic.
00:17:38.599,00:17:39.809,Thank you.
00:17:39.809,00:17:41.352,Where did you learn how to do this?
00:17:41.352,00:17:44.564,"I've just had lots of time to practice, I guess."
00:17:44.564,00:17:47.567,It's really boring here.
00:17:47.567,00:17:49.652,It's boring here?
00:17:49.652,00:17:52.446,"If you're so bored, why aren't you down at the party?"
00:17:52.446,00:17:54.240,I've never really seen the point of it.
00:17:54.240,00:17:57.326,Nobody's ever talked to me before.
00:17:57.994,00:17:59.620,I guess I'm different.
00:17:59.620,00:18:01.664,"There's nothing wrong with being different, you know."
00:18:01.664,00:18:04.208,"Well, you two have a lot in common."
00:18:08.295,00:18:15.469,ESTHER: I think people should always try to take the bad things that happen to them in their lives and turn them into something good.
00:18:15.469,00:18:18.598,Don't you?
00:18:18.598,00:18:20.600,Absolutely.
00:18:27.023,00:18:30.693,"NUN: She's originally from Russia, but it's amazing how strong her English is."
00:18:30.693,00:18:33.153,Given she's only been in the country a few years.
00:18:33.153,00:18:35.364,How often you get children from other countries?
00:18:35.364,00:18:37.951,It's rare.
00:18:35.364,00:18:39.702,"But when we do, it's sometimes difficult to place them."
00:18:39.702,00:18:44.082,The family that brought her to America died in a house fire.
00:18:44.082,00:18:45.792,In a fire?
00:18:45.792,00:18:47.293,My God.
00:18:47.293,00:18:49.003,Esther barely got out.
00:18:49.003,00:18:54.258,"She's been through a lot, but this is an extraordinary little girl."
00:18:54.258,00:18:57.344,She's very bright.
00:18:57.344,00:19:00.014,And she's very well-mannered.
00:19:00.014,00:19:01.808,"She's a bit of a princess, actually."
00:19:01.808,00:19:05.561,She wears those ribbons on her wrists and her neck all the time.
00:19:05.937,00:19:07.354,Mine too.
00:19:07.354,00:19:10.858,The only time we'd ever had trouble with her was when we tried to take them off.
00:19:10.858,00:19:12.485,How does she get along with other kids?
00:19:12.485,00:19:14.779,"Oh, when she has to interact, uh, she's great."
00:19:14.779,00:19:17.031,Babe?
00:19:17.031,00:19:19.617,She really did seem to open up with us.
00:19:19.617,00:19:20.952,Yeah.
00:19:20.952,00:19:23.370,I thought she more than opened up with you.
00:19:23.370,00:19:25.665,You seem to have made quite a connection.
00:19:25.665,00:19:29.919,I could get the paperwork together and see you back here in three weeks.
00:19:36.216,00:19:38.052,All right.
00:19:47.770,00:19:49.022,JOHN: Okey-dokey.
00:19:49.022,00:19:51.190,NUN: Call me if you need anything.
00:19:51.190,00:19:53.151,Bye.
00:20:12.670,00:20:15.339,"Oh, that's T-H."
00:20:15.339,00:20:18.217,T-H. Yeah.
00:20:18.217,00:20:20.344,And Max is like this?
00:20:20.344,00:20:21.679,KATE: Yeah.
00:20:22.805,00:20:24.515,Good.
00:20:28.686,00:20:30.396,Is this your house?
00:20:30.396,00:20:33.232,JOHN: Now it's your house too.
00:20:49.373,00:20:53.544,"KATE: Hi, sweetie. Hi."
00:20:55.963,00:20:58.883,Hey! Hey.
00:20:58.883,00:21:02.428,"Hello, Max."
00:21:02.428,00:21:05.431,She's been practicing the whole way.
00:21:07.349,00:21:09.518,Can she hear?
00:21:09.518,00:21:11.520,"Uh, she was born almost completely deaf."
00:21:11.520,00:21:14.941,That just allows her to hear enough to read lips.
00:21:18.318,00:21:20.988,"That's all right, I got it."
00:21:25.201,00:21:27.745,"Esther, I'd like to introduce you to Grandma Barbara."
00:21:27.745,00:21:29.329,It's a pleasure to meet you.
00:21:29.329,00:21:30.790,Oh!
00:21:30.790,00:21:33.876,That's precious. It's a pleasure to meet you too.
00:21:35.461,00:21:37.546,Danny.
00:21:37.546,00:21:39.882,This is Esther.
00:21:41.801,00:21:43.177,"Hello, Daniel."
00:21:44.262,00:21:46.097,Hey.
00:21:49.516,00:21:51.560,Why does she dress like that?
00:21:51.560,00:21:55.106,"Oh, come on. Stop it."
00:21:55.106,00:21:56.274,Oh!
00:21:57.524,00:22:00.694,You have a piano?
00:22:00.694,00:22:02.280,Would you like to learn how to play?
00:22:02.280,00:22:04.115,I would love to.
00:22:13.166,00:22:14.333,Do you like it?
00:22:14.333,00:22:16.710,It's perfect.
00:22:24.051,00:22:25.385,Thank you.
00:22:25.385,00:22:27.429,How do you say thank you?
00:22:27.805,00:22:32.935,Thank you.
00:22:38.816,00:22:41.694,"Wow, look at that."
00:22:41.694,00:22:44.822,What? What? What?
00:22:44.822,00:22:46.199,"DANIEL: Dad, look."
00:22:46.199,00:22:47.950,Dad.
00:22:47.950,00:22:50.619,"Dad, look, I'm killing Trevor."
00:22:50.619,00:22:52.830,Yes.
00:22:54.207,00:22:55.624,Oh! Thank you.
00:22:55.624,00:22:57.168,Uh.
00:22:57.168,00:22:59.753,"Come on, Dad. My solo's gonna end. Hurry, look."
00:23:01.172,00:23:03.257,"Wow, cool."
00:23:07.887,00:23:10.764,"BOY: Trevor, you suck."
00:23:12.183,00:23:13.726,BOY: That's fabulous.
00:23:15.311,00:23:18.231,"Come on, guys."
00:23:18.231,00:23:20.691,I was just about to beat you.
00:23:21.692,00:23:24.028,"I'm glad you like it, honey."
00:23:41.087,00:23:42.546,"Come on, guys."
00:23:47.760,00:23:50.179,"TREVOR: Hurry up, I'm freezing my ass off. Uh."
00:23:51.471,00:23:55.142,"Dude, it's all in here."
00:23:55.809,00:23:57.435,Oh.
00:23:57.435,00:24:01.065,"Move over, man."
00:24:02.233,00:24:04.568,Wow.
00:24:05.403,00:24:07.154,This looks like your mom.
00:24:08.948,00:24:10.448,No.
00:24:14.912,00:24:17.415,Esther and Maxine seem to be getting along well.
00:24:17.415,00:24:18.665,Yeah.
00:24:18.665,00:24:20.000,"BARBARA: How's she doing, Kate?"
00:24:20.000,00:24:23.212,"You know, Esther's fitting right in."
00:24:23.212,00:24:24.922,I meant Maxine.
00:24:24.922,00:24:27.758,She's playing by the pond like nothing ever happened.
00:24:27.758,00:24:29.635,"She doesn't remember anything, does she?"
00:24:29.635,00:24:32.263,No. She's fine.
00:24:36.976,00:24:40.771,"So, what are your plans?"
00:24:40.771,00:24:46.777,"You know, probably get Esther settled, and then go back to teaching."
00:24:46.777,00:24:48.779,Thought they weren't gonna take you back.
00:24:48.779,00:24:50.488,"No, I'm not talking about Yale."
00:24:50.488,00:24:54.243,I'll just-- I'll probably give lessons from home.
00:24:54.243,00:24:56.245,That's too bad.
00:24:56.245,00:24:58.372,"Well, I didn't quit because I wanted to."
00:24:58.372,00:25:01.792,I know. You had to have your moment of clarity.
00:25:01.792,00:25:05.045,That is an A.A. term.
00:25:05.045,00:25:07.505,And I didn't go to A.A.
00:25:07.505,00:25:11.469,Same difference. We all need a wake-up call sometimes.
00:26:04.188,00:26:06.190,Ah.
00:26:08.192,00:26:09.527,Oh.
00:26:18.285,00:26:19.537,Hi.
00:26:20.704,00:26:24.041,Hi.
00:26:24.708,00:26:26.710,Mmm.
00:26:42.017,00:26:43.810,Yeah?
00:26:45.354,00:26:46.730,Oh!
00:26:46.730,00:26:48.899,We're scared of the lightning.
00:26:48.899,00:26:51.402,"Oh, come in."
00:26:51.402,00:26:56.574,I wanna sleep next to Daddy.
00:26:57.615,00:26:59.577,Okay.
00:27:07.960,00:27:10.837,"JOHN: I'm gonna call later, make sure everything's okay, right?"
00:27:10.837,00:27:13.257,Okay. They're gonna love your design.
00:27:13.257,00:27:15.342,You gonna pick up the phone?
00:27:15.342,00:27:17.094,Yeah? All right.
00:27:17.719,00:27:19.805,KATE: Esther?
00:27:19.805,00:27:21.681,Esther?
00:27:21.681,00:27:23.476,Come on.
00:27:23.476,00:27:27.062,"Esther, come on, we gotta go!"
00:27:27.062,00:27:30.524,You gotta be kidding me.
00:27:30.524,00:27:33.277,KATE: Wow! Uh...
00:27:34.694,00:27:36.363,Will you please go wait in the car?
00:27:36.363,00:27:39.657,Come on.
00:27:39.657,00:27:43.661,"Uh... Sweetheart, this isn't really a school dress."
00:27:43.661,00:27:46.373,But I like it. Don't you think it's pretty?
00:27:46.373,00:27:48.167,"Yes, it's so..."
00:27:46.373,00:27:51.253,"it's so beautiful, but I just don't think you're gonna be comfortable in it."
00:27:51.253,00:27:53.088,What about those jeans that I bought you?
00:27:53.088,00:27:55.757,"You're afraid the other children will laugh at me, aren't you?"
00:27:55.757,00:28:00.387,I thought you said there wasn't anything wrong with being different.
00:28:01.514,00:28:04.183,"Yes, you're right."
00:28:04.183,00:28:06.852,Okay. Have fun. He.
00:28:08.270,00:28:11.064,"TEACHER: Take a seat, please."
00:28:11.064,00:28:13.317,"Don't make me ask again, please."
00:28:13.317,00:28:17.404,"Okay, this is our new student."
00:28:17.404,00:28:20.115,And I'd like you all to make her feel very welcome today.
00:28:20.115,00:28:23.869,"Oh, look. Little Bo Peep texted me. She wants her outfit back."
00:28:27.747,00:28:29.707,"TEACHER: Okay, go take a seat."
00:28:31.293,00:28:34.421,"Okay, if everybody could turn to Page 27..."
00:28:39.051,00:28:40.386,KATE: No!
00:28:40.386,00:28:42.846,"No! Esther, what are you doing?"
00:28:42.846,00:28:46.350,Get away from there! No!
00:28:46.350,00:28:49.853,You don't play near the water!
00:28:49.853,00:28:51.355,"Come on, get out!"
00:28:52.814,00:28:54.567,Max.
00:29:05.411,00:29:06.620,DANIEL: Uh.
00:29:11.791,00:29:14.587,Sweet. Bull's-eye.
00:29:15.921,00:29:17.214,"Oh, got you."
00:29:50.247,00:29:51.873,Did you kill it?
00:29:51.873,00:29:54.167,"It's just a paintball, I didn't think it would hurt him."
00:30:03.636,00:30:06.722,Put it out of its misery.
00:30:06.722,00:30:10.142,"It's in pain, and it's your responsibility."
00:30:10.142,00:30:11.477,It was just an accident.
00:30:11.477,00:30:13.895,"If you walk away now, it'll starve to death."
00:30:13.895,00:30:15.606,Is that what you want?
00:30:20.444,00:30:22.613,I'm not doing it.
00:30:28.410,00:30:29.703,It's all right.
00:30:29.703,00:30:33.457,It's in heaven now.
00:30:41.089,00:30:43.425,Is the water warm enough?
00:30:43.425,00:30:45.885,Okay. Call me if you need anything.
00:31:04.279,00:31:05.572,Esther?
00:31:06.615,00:31:08.492,Esther.
00:31:09.034,00:31:10.118,Open this door.
00:31:14.331,00:31:17.083,What are you doing?
00:31:17.083,00:31:19.044,"No, we don't lock doors in this house."
00:31:19.044,00:31:20.962,But what if someone comes in and sees me?
00:31:21.630,00:31:23.465,Nobody's gonna come in.
00:31:23.465,00:31:26.510,"Uh. Look, I'm gonna stand right here, if that's what you want."
00:31:26.510,00:31:28.178,I could sing for you.
00:31:28.178,00:31:32.725,I used to sing for the sisters in the orphanage so they would know I was all right.
00:31:35.060,00:31:37.270,Okay.
00:31:37.270,00:31:40.982,All right. But you know what?
00:32:37.831,00:32:39.625,Oh.
00:33:26.421,00:33:30.592,Your parents must have gone to a lot of retard camps to find someone as dumb as her.
00:33:32.218,00:33:34.012,Watch it.
00:33:34.888,00:33:36.431,GIRL: Are you okay?
00:33:42.395,00:33:44.230,Is this a bible?
00:33:46.107,00:33:48.360,Jesus Freak brought a bible to school today.
00:33:54.324,00:33:56.034,"GIRL: Hey, wanna come over?"
00:34:02.666,00:34:04.668,Your sister's a total spaz.
00:34:04.668,00:34:06.461,She's not my sister.
00:34:07.754,00:34:10.465,GIRL: I can't believe you did that.
00:34:10.465,00:34:11.675,"Oh, little doggy."
00:34:11.675,00:34:13.552,"Is this your collar, little doggy?"
00:34:30.193,00:34:33.947,"Not A. A, B."
00:34:40.328,00:34:42.163,You did really good.
00:34:42.163,00:34:45.375,"No, I didn't."
00:34:47.669,00:34:49.170,I'll do better next time.
00:34:49.170,00:34:51.840,Your teacher told me what happened today.
00:34:53.550,00:34:55.886,Don't you want to talk about it?
00:34:57.054,00:34:59.222,There's nothing to talk about.
00:34:59.222,00:35:01.349,"You know I'm here for you, right?"
00:35:01.349,00:35:02.893,"You know that, right?"
00:35:03.977,00:35:06.187,I got something I wanna show you.
00:35:11.401,00:35:13.695,I have one just like this that I use as a diary.
00:35:13.695,00:35:19.910,And I thought that maybe you and I could use this one for a scrapbook.
00:35:19.910,00:35:22.120,That's Mommy and Daddy on their wedding day.
00:35:24.081,00:35:26.541,"That's Daniel, Christmas morning."
00:35:28.293,00:35:30.545,Here's Max.
00:35:33.172,00:35:34.841,And there's you.
00:35:40.013,00:35:41.932,Who's Jessica?
00:35:43.308,00:35:46.645,Max talks about her.
00:35:46.645,00:35:49.940,"I never held you, but I feel you."
00:35:49.940,00:35:53.944,"KATE: You never spoke, but I hear you."
00:35:55.112,00:35:59.825,"I never knew you, but I love you."
00:36:05.288,00:36:06.915,What happened to her?
00:36:09.668,00:36:12.420,She died while she was still in my tummy.
00:36:13.463,00:36:15.548,But we scattered her ashes here.
00:36:15.548,00:36:24.557,"And as long as this plant grows, then part of her will be alive inside it."
00:36:32.524,00:36:35.318,She would have been lucky.
00:36:35.318,00:36:37.236,You're a great mommy.
00:36:43.869,00:36:45.328,"Thank you, sweetheart."
00:36:45.328,00:36:48.414,Thank you. It means a lot.
00:36:52.293,00:36:54.963,How are you?
00:36:54.963,00:36:59.467,It's very interesting.
00:36:59.467,00:37:01.511,That's very interesting.
00:37:01.511,00:37:03.555,I'm starting to feel a real connection.
00:37:03.555,00:37:05.348,Mmm. Me too.
00:37:08.560,00:37:10.020,"No, honey, not here."
00:37:10.020,00:37:12.313,Shh. They're sleeping.
00:37:12.313,00:37:16.193,"Baby, come here, you'll like it, believe me."
00:37:22.949,00:37:24.450,"Okay, let's get down to business."
00:37:24.450,00:37:25.577,"No, no, no."
00:37:25.577,00:37:27.954,"Okay, just for a second, then."
00:37:28.454,00:37:29.664,Yeah.
00:37:39.632,00:37:41.634,"No, no, no."
00:37:41.634,00:37:44.054,I have to.
00:37:52.187,00:37:54.147,Yeah.
00:38:21.007,00:38:22.968,Ow!
00:38:37.774,00:38:39.442,"Oh, Jesus."
00:38:40.902,00:38:44.072,"Jesus, honey."
00:38:50.662,00:38:52.538,Esther?
00:38:53.581,00:38:56.209,We have to talk about last night.
00:38:56.209,00:38:58.795,Do we?
00:39:01.339,00:39:07.804,"See, there are certain things that grown-ups do that children aren't supposed to see."
00:39:07.804,00:39:11.975,"And, uh, that was one of them."
00:39:16.021,00:39:18.315,"Esther, listen to me."
00:39:20.358,00:39:29.701,"Er, uh-- When grown-ups love each other very, very much, they wanna show each other that love. Express it."
00:39:29.701,00:39:31.203,I know. They fuck.
00:39:35.207,00:39:36.791,She could've picked it up anywhere.
00:39:36.791,00:39:38.293,She probably picked it up at school.
00:39:38.293,00:39:40.170,This wasn't something she overheard.
00:39:40.170,00:39:42.339,"I mean, she knew what it meant."
00:39:42.339,00:39:43.506,Huh.
00:39:43.506,00:39:49.012,"And, babe, the way she said it is-- I don't even think she expected to get in trouble over it."
00:39:50.805,00:39:53.850,"Well, we'll talk to her about it tonight."
00:39:54.893,00:39:57.478,Ahh. Fine.
00:39:57.478,00:40:00.190,"Well, what did you have in mind?"
00:40:00.190,00:40:02.441,"No, I thought we could take her to Dr.Browning."
00:40:04.027,00:40:06.946,I don't think we need to take her to the shrink quite yet.
00:40:06.946,00:40:09.241,"Well, you know, we just don't know that much about her."
00:40:09.241,00:40:15.538,"I mean, for all we know, the family she stayed with could've been like: Pass the fucking potatoes at dinnertime, you know?"
00:40:17.249,00:40:20.835,"If she's saying it to my face, what is she saying when we're not there?"
00:40:20.835,00:40:23.546,I don't want her exerting that kind of influence over Max.
00:40:25.173,00:40:29.761,"Anyway, I just don't want to make a big deal out of one little dirty word."
00:40:31.512,00:40:35.225,"Fine. Fucking spend some time with her, then."
00:40:35.225,00:40:37.476,"All right, bitch."
00:40:40.479,00:40:43.108,GIRL: Let's have a snow fight!
00:40:44.025,00:40:46.652,"WOMAN: Come on, no throwing snowballs."
00:40:56.829,00:40:58.164,"WOMAN: Hey, neighbor."
00:41:00.166,00:41:01.293,Hey.
00:41:01.293,00:41:03.669,Haven't seen you around lately.
00:41:03.669,00:41:05.713,JOHN: I've been pretty busy.
00:41:05.713,00:41:09.384,Has the homeowners' association been soldiering on without me?
00:41:09.384,00:41:10.969,It's not the same.
00:41:24.441,00:41:27.652,"WOMAN: Actually, I had a favor to ask."
00:41:27.652,00:41:35.076,"I have a chair that I need moved upstairs, and I was hoping you could come by and help me-- with that sometime."
00:41:35.701,00:41:37.203,Oh. Yeah.
00:41:37.203,00:41:39.414,"Yeah, sure."
00:41:39.414,00:41:40.873,Maybe Kate and I could help you out.
00:41:40.873,00:41:42.375,Just let us know.
00:41:42.375,00:41:44.752,I'll call you.
00:41:48.589,00:41:50.633,"BOY: Okay, I'm watching you."
00:44:03.933,00:44:08.938,Brenda's father says that you pushed her.
00:44:08.938,00:44:10.607,That's not true.
00:44:10.607,00:44:12.317,We were just playing.
00:44:12.317,00:44:14.735,I swear.
00:44:15.861,00:44:18.323,Okay.
00:44:52.898,00:44:55.151,"What? Mom, what's she saying?"
00:44:55.151,00:44:58.112,She wants you to pass the bread and butter.
00:44:59.447,00:45:00.906,Wasn't asking you.
00:45:00.906,00:45:02.699,"JOHN: Hey, now."
00:45:11.876,00:45:13.503,Can you eat normal?
00:45:15.838,00:45:17.382,I am eating normal.
00:45:17.382,00:45:20.009,"Maybe in Transylvania, or whatever country you're from."
00:45:20.009,00:45:22.637,"Incidentally, I'm from Russia."
00:45:22.637,00:45:25.390,Transylvania isn't even a country.
00:45:25.390,00:45:27.350,It's a part of Romania.
00:45:27.350,00:45:28.809,You are such a freak.
00:45:28.809,00:45:30.353,Hey.
00:45:30.353,00:45:32.855,"I don't want any more talk like that, all right?"
00:45:32.855,00:45:34.940,But why does she have to act like that?
00:45:34.940,00:45:37.860,All my friends make fun of me because of her.
00:45:37.860,00:45:39.862,Maybe you need some different friends.
00:45:39.862,00:45:42.865,Maybe you should send her back to the retard camp where she belongs.
00:45:42.865,00:45:44.825,Daniel.
00:45:44.825,00:45:46.494,Apologize to your sister.
00:45:46.494,00:45:49.497,She's not my fucking sister.
00:45:53.000,00:45:54.377,I got it.
00:45:56.379,00:45:57.922,Okay.
00:46:00.675,00:46:01.800,That's me.
00:46:19.652,00:46:22.113,You get the key back when you say you're sorry.
00:46:28.202,00:46:31.623,Is there anything special you want me to make tonight?
00:46:31.623,00:46:33.124,You have any favorites?
00:46:37.086,00:46:38.379,Hello.
00:46:38.379,00:46:39.672,"AWell, how are you?"
00:46:39.672,00:46:41.798,"Hi, we're great."
00:46:41.798,00:46:43.842,How is she?
00:46:43.842,00:46:46.763,"Hey, Sister Abigail."
00:46:46.763,00:46:49.098,"Come on. Esther, just quickly say hi."
00:46:49.098,00:46:51.100,I said no.
00:46:54.395,00:46:59.776,"You know what, do you mind, darling, can you get five apples for me?"
00:46:59.776,00:47:03.070,"Sorry, she got shy all of a sudden."
00:47:03.070,00:47:04.947,It's all right.
00:47:03.070,00:47:11.078,I'm actually just calling to remind you that I'm gonna need her medical and dental charts for my supervision report.
00:47:14.039,00:47:16.793,"Uh, she's not thrilled about the dentist."
00:47:21.046,00:47:23.758,How is everyone doing?
00:47:23.758,00:47:25.176,I guess you can say that.
00:47:25.176,00:47:27.470,She dropped the F-bomb on me a few weeks ago.
00:47:30.139,00:47:32.057,Guess she's finally coming out of her shell.
00:47:32.057,00:47:34.226,Yeah.
00:47:35.394,00:47:37.438,Any other glitches I should know of?
00:47:37.438,00:47:38.939,We had a big one recently.
00:47:38.939,00:47:41.317,It's a girl named Brenda at school.
00:47:43.319,00:47:46.989,"They were at the playground, there was a slide, well, she fell off."
00:47:46.989,00:47:49.617,Esther may have pushed her down.
00:47:49.617,00:47:53.204,"I don't know, I'm not getting the story straight, but she got hurt."
00:47:53.204,00:47:55.164,Is she all right?
00:47:55.164,00:47:57.750,She broke her ankle and had something like six stitches.
00:47:57.750,00:47:59.418,That doesn't sound too lucky.
00:47:59.418,00:48:01.878,"Well, she's lucky she didn't break her neck."
00:48:31.659,00:48:33.494,You told me you didn't know how to play.
00:48:33.494,00:48:35.996,"No, I didn't."
00:48:35.996,00:48:37.373,"Yes, you did."
00:48:37.373,00:48:40.292,You offered to teach me and I accepted.
00:48:40.292,00:48:46.006,"Okay. So then, you were just pretending this whole time?"
00:48:46.006,00:48:47.924,I thought you would enjoy teaching me.
00:48:47.924,00:48:55.932,It must be frustrating for someone who loves music as much as you to have a son who isn't interested and a daughter who can't even hear.
00:49:01.439,00:49:03.858,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:49:05.860,00:49:08.696,I walk in on her playing Tchaikovsky without a mistake.
00:49:08.696,00:49:11.031,"I mean, she's been lying to me this whole time."
00:49:11.031,00:49:12.991,I think she just wants to spend time with you.
00:49:12.991,00:49:15.286,It's hardly a lie.
00:49:15.286,00:49:16.454,"Honestly, you wouldn't."
00:49:16.454,00:49:17.954,She's on her best behavior with you.
00:49:17.954,00:49:21.459,She's completely different with me.
00:49:21.459,00:49:23.335,"So, what are you saying?"
00:49:23.335,00:49:26.255,I don't know.
00:49:26.255,00:49:28.257,She pushed Brenda at the playground.
00:49:28.257,00:49:30.217,So now you're saying that was her fault?
00:49:30.217,00:49:31.844,I don't know.
00:49:31.844,00:49:34.221,I wasn't there. You were supposed to be watching them.
00:49:34.221,00:49:37.934,"Oh, come on."
00:49:37.934,00:49:41.312,"Okay, let's not blame her for anything, fine."
00:49:41.312,00:49:42.855,I'll take her word for everything.
00:49:42.855,00:49:46.484,Should I just believe what she said about you and Joyce Patterson too?
00:49:46.484,00:49:48.611,What did she say?
00:49:48.611,00:49:51.071,She says that you were hitting on her.
00:49:51.071,00:49:53.491,What?
00:49:53.491,00:49:58.579,"Oh, come on. She must've misunderstood. It was, like-- Did she invite you over?"
00:49:58.579,00:50:01.916,"She, uh-- She asked me to help her move a chair."
00:50:01.916,00:50:04.126,She did?
00:50:04.126,00:50:06.295,I blew her off.
00:50:06.295,00:50:08.923,"Oh, God."
00:50:08.923,00:50:10.215,Why didn't you tell me?
00:50:10.215,00:50:12.259,Because-- We could've laughed about it.
00:50:12.259,00:50:14.094,"No, I knew how-- You were hiding it."
00:50:14.094,00:50:16.806,"Because, honey, I knew how you'd react."
00:50:16.806,00:50:19.183,Kate. Kate.
00:50:19.183,00:50:22.144,"You can't get jealous of every woman that I talk to, right?"
00:50:22.144,00:50:24.605,It's been like 10 years.
00:50:24.605,00:50:26.983,You say that like it actually means something.
00:50:26.983,00:50:29.485,It's only been two years since you told me.
00:50:29.485,00:50:31.696,You know how sorry I am.
00:50:31.696,00:50:34.699,I just feel like I've earned a little trust here.
00:50:34.699,00:50:36.325,I gave you a second chance.
00:50:36.325,00:50:38.536,That's not fair.
00:50:38.536,00:50:39.829,Let me get this straight.
00:50:39.829,00:50:42.080,"We can talk about my mistakes, not yours?"
00:50:42.080,00:50:43.624,I was sick!
00:50:42.080,00:50:45.376,You were an asshole who wanted to fuck somebody else!
00:50:45.376,00:50:47.837,You put our child's life in danger.
00:50:47.837,00:50:50.422,I could've walked away months ago.
00:50:50.422,00:50:53.885,Nobody would've blamed me.
00:50:53.885,00:50:55.678,"Where did you get that from, your mother?"
00:51:09.316,00:51:10.651,Danny.
00:51:10.651,00:51:13.029,"Turn that crap down, please, I gotta work."
00:51:13.029,00:51:14.405,Fine.
00:51:18.951,00:51:20.578,I'll get it.
00:51:26.250,00:51:27.668,"Ah. Hello, Esther."
00:51:27.668,00:51:30.004,What are you doing here?
00:51:30.004,00:51:32.130,May I come in?
00:51:32.130,00:51:35.760,I'm afraid I may have made a mistake.
00:51:35.760,00:51:37.970,I think there could be something wrong with Esther.
00:51:37.970,00:51:39.680,What?
00:51:39.680,00:51:42.683,You told us that you'd never had any trouble with her.
00:51:42.683,00:51:44.100,I didn't.
00:51:44.100,00:51:46.144,But trouble does have a way of finding her.
00:51:46.144,00:51:47.521,What kind of trouble?
00:51:48.814,00:51:51.233,"Two girls get into a fight, there she is."
00:51:51.233,00:51:54.028,"Someone gets caught stealing, there she is again."
00:51:54.028,00:51:56.363,So? Does that mean--?
00:51:56.363,00:52:00.618,"After you told me about the girl in the playground, I called her old school."
00:52:00.618,00:52:08.417,"While she was there, there was a boy who fell with a pair of scissors in his hand and accidentally stabbed himself through the jaw."
00:52:08.417,00:52:09.961,And Esther was there again.
00:52:09.961,00:52:12.630,I don't understand.
00:52:12.630,00:52:17.051,It's-- But the most troubling thing is the Sullivan house fire.
00:52:17.051,00:52:18.928,I checked into it further.
00:52:18.928,00:52:20.262,It was arson.
00:52:20.262,00:52:23.599,They have never found the person who did it.
00:52:23.599,00:52:25.893,JOHN: What are you suggesting here?
00:52:25.893,00:52:28.395,That she had anything to do with any of this?
00:52:28.395,00:52:29.688,It's ridiculous.
00:52:29.688,00:52:34.026,"That a child could commit such crimes, it just flies in the face of everything I believe."
00:52:34.026,00:52:35.486,"Well, yeah."
00:52:40.574,00:52:44.453,There's a mean lady here.
00:52:44.453,00:52:47.247,Will you help me?
00:52:47.247,00:52:53.838,"We've had some behavioral problems, but-- Yeah, nothing like that."
00:52:53.838,00:52:55.631,"Yes, we have."
00:52:55.631,00:53:00.094,ABIGAIL: I've tried to reach the Russian orphanage where she was raised.
00:53:00.094,00:53:03.388,I think we need to know what we're dealing with.
00:53:03.388,00:53:05.141,I'll tell you what we're dealing with.
00:53:05.141,00:53:07.059,"We're dealing with-- No, you know what?"
00:53:07.059,00:53:08.686,Stop it. Listen.
00:53:08.686,00:53:11.063,We're dealing with a 9-year-old girl who's an orphan.
00:53:11.063,00:53:13.398,That's it. We're taking her to Dr. Browning.
00:53:13.398,00:53:15.275,We can take her to Dr. Browning.
00:54:13.209,00:54:15.002,Do you want to play?
00:54:22.051,00:54:25.012,ABIGAIL: I'll call you as soon as I find anything else out.
00:54:25.012,00:54:26.180,Right. Take care.
00:54:26.180,00:54:27.556,KATE: Okay. Thank you very much.
00:54:27.556,00:54:29.265,Maybe later.
00:54:49.912,00:54:51.413,It's going to be fine.
00:54:51.413,00:54:55.000,We'll scare her so bad she'll never come back here.
00:55:03.175,00:55:04.300,ESTHER: Here she comes.
00:55:04.300,00:55:06.428,Wave your arms and make her stop.
00:55:06.428,00:55:07.930,"Max, go."
00:55:17.397,00:55:18.607,Whoa!
00:55:29.618,00:55:31.578,Oh!
00:55:36.458,00:55:39.003,Oh! You all right?
00:55:39.003,00:55:40.212,Max?
00:55:40.212,00:55:42.131,Max?
00:55:42.131,00:55:43.632,You okay?
00:55:57.104,00:55:58.480,Stop crying.
00:55:58.480,00:56:03.902,Grab a foot and help me get her off the road.
00:56:03.902,00:56:05.237,Now.
00:57:14.598,00:57:16.850,Help me hide her.
00:57:56.181,00:57:57.975,That doesn't matter.
00:57:57.975,00:58:01.519,They'll send you to jail just for helping me hide her.
00:58:01.519,00:58:05.690,I had to kill her because she was going to tell on me.
00:58:07.109,00:58:12.197,You're not going to tell on me.
00:58:21.457,00:58:22.833,Don't worry.
00:58:22.833,00:58:25.085,You're my little sister.
00:58:25.085,00:58:28.422,I won't let anything happen to you.
00:58:28.422,00:58:30.174,I love you.
00:59:38.033,00:59:39.535,Shh.
00:59:40.369,00:59:42.246,Tell me what you saw.
00:59:42.246,00:59:45.207,What are you doing?
00:59:45.207,00:59:48.335,I saw you and Max in the tree house.
00:59:48.335,00:59:49.794,What else?
00:59:49.794,00:59:52.130,What do you mean?
00:59:52.130,00:59:53.965,I didn't see anything else.
00:59:53.965,00:59:56.176,Did you tell anyone?
00:59:56.176,00:59:58.429,I didn't tell anyone.
00:59:59.930,01:00:01.306,Please.
01:00:01.306,01:00:08.397,"If I find out that you're lying, I'll cut your hairless little prick off before you even figure out what it's for."
01:00:09.189,01:00:12.443,Do you understand me?
01:00:15.779,01:00:17.406,You pissed yourself.
01:00:17.406,01:00:19.199,Ugh.
01:00:28.917,01:00:30.377,"It was nice talking to you, Alice."
01:00:30.377,01:00:33.130,I hope we can be friends.
01:00:34.672,01:00:37.384,"We'll be right out, honey."
01:00:45.058,01:00:52.149,My initial instinct is that there's not a deeply-rooted problem in Esther's past.
01:00:52.149,01:00:54.901,Oh. So there's nothing wrong with her?
01:00:54.901,01:00:57.070,No.
01:00:59.990,01:01:01.325,But it's not all good news.
01:01:01.325,01:01:06.788,I think what needs to be examined is Esther's relationship with those around her.
01:01:06.788,01:01:08.582,"Specifically with you, Kate."
01:01:08.582,01:01:12.586,It seems she feels there's been some real tension between the two of you.
01:01:12.586,01:01:13.878,Okay.
01:01:13.878,01:01:18.592,"She's really doing her best to please you, but you're blocking her attempts to bond."
01:01:18.592,01:01:23.180,That's not-- That's not true.
01:01:23.180,01:01:25.140,I've done everything. Right?
01:01:25.140,01:01:27.184,Just let her finish.
01:01:27.184,01:01:30.270,Something's happening to cause Esther to feel this way.
01:01:30.270,01:01:34.732,Perhaps it's your-- guilt about drinking or what happened to Max.
01:01:34.732,01:01:41.156,Maybe some of your feelings of inadequacy as a mother are manifesting themselves in your relationship with Esther.
01:01:41.156,01:01:43.617,I don't feel inadequate.
01:01:46.662,01:01:48.455,What did she tell you?
01:01:48.455,01:01:51.500,She didn't see.
01:01:53.126,01:01:55.128,She's so stupid.
01:01:55.128,01:02:02.760,"Esther's a very shy, reserved, sensitive little girl going through an extremely difficult time."
01:02:09.267,01:02:13.063,She's exceptionally bright and highly articulate.
01:02:15.815,01:02:19.528,She just needs a little patience and understanding.
01:02:37.379,01:02:39.631,Thanks for your support back there.
01:02:40.424,01:02:42.759,That was your idea.
01:02:45.679,01:02:47.264,"Kate, wait, wait, wait."
01:02:48.181,01:02:51.685,"I'm not a psychiatrist, but a lot of what she said made sense."
01:02:51.685,01:02:53.144,Do you wanna get that?
01:02:57.274,01:02:58.525,Hello?
01:02:58.525,01:02:59.943,"WOMAN: Hello, is this Mrs. Coleman?"
01:02:59.943,01:03:01.278,Yes. Who's this?
01:03:01.278,01:03:03.029,This is Sister Judith from St. Mariana's.
01:03:03.029,01:03:08.868,"I'm sorry to bother you, but I really need to know if Sister Abigail made it to her appointment with you."
01:03:08.868,01:03:10.995,Yes. Why?
01:03:10.995,01:03:15.459,"JUDITH: She hasn't returned since yesterday, and I'm just starting to get really worried."
01:03:26.511,01:03:29.306,"MAN: Charlie 24, you wanna hold them there?"
01:03:34.519,01:03:36.271,Hey.
01:03:42.110,01:03:44.154,"Okay, I think we're done."
01:03:45.530,01:03:48.992,"Detective, do you have any leads or suspects?"
01:03:48.992,01:03:49.993,"No, not yet."
01:03:49.993,01:03:55.791,I just don't understand this kind of thing.
01:03:53.246,01:03:57.292,Who would do this? It's-- Awful.
01:03:57.292,01:03:59.503,"You think of anything else, you give us a call."
01:03:59.503,01:04:00.629,Yes. Absolutely.
01:04:01.672,01:04:02.798,Let's go.
01:04:59.688,01:05:02.148,KATE: This is what Sister Abigail was talking about.
01:05:02.148,01:05:03.358,Look.
01:05:03.358,01:05:05.694,Character-disturbed children.
01:05:05.694,01:05:07.237,Look at the symptoms.
01:05:07.237,01:05:09.197,Superficially charming.
01:05:09.197,01:05:11.324,Difficulty at making and keeping friends.
01:05:11.324,01:05:13.577,Oh-- kay.
01:05:13.577,01:05:15.537,I'm not sure this is what she meant.
01:05:15.537,01:05:19.040,She could've told Dr. Browning whatever she wanted to hear.
01:05:21.752,01:05:27.674,"They are adroit manipulators, oftentimes playing people off one another to get what they want."
01:05:27.674,01:05:29.467,"Well, you gonna show this to Dr. Browning?"
01:05:29.467,01:05:31.595,I'm not showing her anything.
01:05:33.054,01:05:34.890,I'm not seeing her anymore.
01:05:34.890,01:05:36.433,When did you decide that?
01:05:36.433,01:05:37.975,When do you think?
01:05:37.975,01:05:40.061,You're gonna discount everything she said?
01:05:40.061,01:05:44.065,Why does everyone around here get the benefit of the doubt from you except for me?
01:05:53.867,01:05:58.371,"If you need help with the kids, we can arrange that."
01:06:07.798,01:06:09.758,I just wanna know more about her.
01:06:09.758,01:06:14.512,"I wanna know where she came from, and I wanna know who she is."
01:06:14.512,01:06:16.807,What if Sister Abigail was right?
01:06:16.807,01:06:21.018,"I mean, if someone was in danger, if our own children were in danger, wouldn't you wanna know?"
01:06:21.018,01:06:23.146,Of course I would.
01:06:23.146,01:06:25.440,I'll contact the orphanage she came from in Russia.
01:06:25.440,01:06:26.775,All right?
01:06:26.775,01:06:28.359,"I mean, it's a start."
01:06:38.578,01:06:40.997,What?
01:06:47.587,01:06:49.172,Fine.
01:06:49.172,01:06:52.843,I was wondering if you'd heard from anyone at the Sludyanka Orphan Shelter in Russia.
01:06:52.843,01:06:57.472,"Sister Abigail had mentioned that she would-- Oh, you did."
01:07:00.475,01:07:01.977,I don't understand.
01:07:01.977,01:07:03.603,How can they have no record of her being there?
01:07:05.396,01:07:06.731,"Yes, please."
01:07:05.396,01:07:10.109,"Could you just-- Could you call me as soon as you know anything, please? Thank you."
01:07:43.018,01:07:44.728,"Esther, we gotta go."
01:07:51.359,01:07:52.986,Esther?
01:07:57.032,01:07:58.742,Esther?
01:07:58.742,01:08:00.201,Whoo!
01:08:00.201,01:08:01.912,You got me.
01:08:04.205,01:08:05.456,What?
01:08:05.456,01:08:07.166,I don't want to go to the dentist.
01:08:07.166,01:08:10.169,Why not?
01:08:10.169,01:08:12.547,"What, are you scared?"
01:08:14.215,01:08:15.717,"We're gonna reschedule, though."
01:08:15.717,01:08:20.638,"Tell you what, I'll let you play hooky this time if you want to come downstairs and draw with me."
01:08:20.638,01:08:21.890,All right.
01:08:26.310,01:08:27.979,"KATE: Wait, Daniel."
01:08:27.979,01:08:31.900,How are you two getting along with Esther?
01:08:34.235,01:08:35.361,"Fine, I guess."
01:08:35.361,01:08:36.988,Yeah?
01:08:39.115,01:08:46.497,"But has she ever made you feel, I don't know, uncomfortable, or has she done anything that she's not supposed to do?"
01:08:47.373,01:08:49.793,No.
01:08:47.373,01:08:51.711,"Like, has she ever hurt any of you?"
01:08:52.670,01:08:54.089,No.
01:08:57.717,01:08:59.302,You sure?
01:09:02.722,01:09:04.849,Okay. All right.
01:09:07.310,01:09:10.146,ESTHER: I like it when it's just the two of us.
01:09:10.146,01:09:14.525,You don't know how long I've waited for a daddy just like you.
01:09:14.525,01:09:15.986,"Mommy too, right?"
01:09:17.862,01:09:20.573,I don't think Mommy likes me very much.
01:09:20.573,01:09:22.450,Hey. That is not true.
01:09:22.450,01:09:24.035,It's all right.
01:09:24.035,01:09:28.331,It must be hard to love an adopted child as much as your own.
01:09:26.329,01:09:31.876,"Sweetheart, you're just as much a part of this family as Danny and Max. Okay?"
01:09:31.876,01:09:33.920,Why don't you do something nice for Mommy.
01:09:33.920,01:09:35.755,Show her how much you love her.
01:09:35.755,01:09:38.257,That's a wonderful idea.
01:09:58.611,01:10:00.905,"I have a special surprise for you, Mommy."
01:10:01.781,01:10:03.282,You do?
01:10:05.160,01:10:07.453,I picked these flowers just for you.
01:10:10.331,01:10:14.878,"Esther, what did you do? God."
01:10:15.503,01:10:16.921,My arm!
01:10:16.921,01:10:18.589,Why did you do this?
01:10:18.589,01:10:20.842,John!
01:10:20.842,01:10:22.468,What did you do?
01:10:22.468,01:10:24.179,"Hey. Stop, stop."
01:10:24.179,01:10:25.930,Why did you do this?
01:10:25.930,01:10:28.558,"Oh, God. God, she did this on purpose."
01:10:28.558,01:10:30.894,"No, no, no. Honey, no."
01:10:30.894,01:10:32.770,She knew what these roses meant to me.
01:10:32.770,01:10:34.271,"It's my fault, hon."
01:10:34.271,01:10:36.482,I told her to do something nice for you.
01:10:36.482,01:10:38.275,I can't believe this.
01:12:20.419,01:12:22.797,Daddy!
01:12:23.422,01:12:25.800,Daddy!
01:12:26.801,01:12:29.428,"Daddy, Daddy!"
01:12:29.428,01:12:30.554,"What is it, honey?"
01:12:30.554,01:12:33.432,My arm still hurts.
01:12:38.062,01:12:40.439,Can I have a look at it?
01:12:40.439,01:12:41.691,You're okay.
01:12:41.691,01:12:44.319,I'll be gentle.
01:12:44.319,01:12:46.362,"Oh, my God."
01:12:47.905,01:12:50.741,We need to take you to the hospital.
01:12:55.079,01:12:57.581,"JOHN: You're a brave little girl, you know that?"
01:12:57.581,01:13:00.501,"Doctor said you're gonna heal real fast, okay?"
01:13:17.185,01:13:18.435,You broke her arm.
01:13:20.855,01:13:23.983,KATE: It's impossible.
01:13:23.983,01:13:27.195,She wants to sleep in here tonight.
01:13:27.195,01:13:29.947,Maybe you should sleep downstairs.
01:13:49.633,01:13:51.635,I'm having guests for dinner.
01:13:56.307,01:13:59.143,"You know, uh, you can have it. Thanks."
01:15:02.373,01:15:04.792,KATE: Have a good day.
01:15:12.425,01:15:13.759,Daniel.
01:15:14.344,01:15:15.970,Your books.
01:15:19.390,01:15:21.642,What happened?
01:15:21.642,01:15:22.977,I don't know.
01:15:24.895,01:15:27.606,We just bought this.
01:15:35.114,01:15:36.240,Mom!
01:15:38.868,01:15:40.328,Max! No!
01:15:40.328,01:15:42.205,Help!
01:15:44.207,01:15:45.708,Max!
01:15:47.168,01:15:48.919,KATE: Max!
01:16:01.307,01:16:02.975,Max!
01:16:10.149,01:16:11.275,Max!
01:16:11.984,01:16:13.486,Are you okay?
01:16:13.486,01:16:16.531,I'm here. Mommy's here.
01:16:16.531,01:16:18.074,Come on.
01:16:18.074,01:16:20.910,I got you. Yeah.
01:16:20.910,01:16:22.995,I'm so sorry.
01:16:24.830,01:16:27.458,I remember I put it in park and I set the brake.
01:16:27.458,01:16:30.336,Max didn't indicate that Esther did anything.
01:16:30.336,01:16:32.963,"Well, Max is covering for her."
01:16:32.963,01:16:34.840,And I don't think it's the first time.
01:16:34.840,01:16:39.345,BROWING: It also wouldn't be the first time you blamed Esther for your own mistake.
01:16:42.723,01:16:44.600,You know what?
01:16:44.600,01:16:50.273,So you're ready for somebody to just come in here and take her away?
01:16:50.273,01:16:52.816,I will do whatever it takes to protect my children.
01:16:54.193,01:16:56.195,JOHN: The girls found this this morning.
01:16:56.946,01:16:58.989,KATE: The girls found it.
01:16:58.989,01:17:00.616,You mean Esther found it.
01:17:00.616,01:17:02.535,Does it make any difference? Is she lying?
01:17:02.535,01:17:04.245,BROWNING: You need help.
01:17:04.245,01:17:09.500,We've reserved a place for you in a rehabilitation facility about 45 minutes from here.
01:17:09.500,01:17:11.168,KATE: I didn't drink it.
01:17:11.168,01:17:12.795,I bought two bottles.
01:17:12.795,01:17:14.671,I poured one of them down the sink.
01:17:14.671,01:17:16.673,But not this one?
01:17:16.673,01:17:20.553,"John, I haven't had a drink in-- in almost a year."
01:17:20.553,01:17:25.308,"We wanna help you, but there's nothing we can do until you stop lying to yourself."
01:17:25.308,01:17:27.477,KATE: I'm not lying.
01:17:27.477,01:17:32.607,"You have no fucking idea how badly I wanted to drink it, but I didn't."
01:17:32.607,01:17:37.612,If Max had gotten hurt-- What happened this morning has nothing to do with this.
01:17:37.612,01:17:39.405,I find that hard to believe.
01:17:39.405,01:17:44.243,The only reason that I'm sober is because of Max and Daniel.
01:17:45.119,01:17:51.375,"I look at the pond, I think about what would have happened had you not been there, and it makes me wanna kill myself."
01:17:51.375,01:17:56.297,"I would never, I would never do anything to let something like that ever happen again. I wouldn't."
01:17:56.297,01:17:58.715,That is so manipulative.
01:17:58.715,01:18:03.095,"John, I know I haven't given you reason to believe me, I know I haven't."
01:18:03.095,01:18:04.805,I should have told you about this.
01:18:04.805,01:18:08.351,"I'll go to therapy, I'll go to fucking A.A."
01:18:08.351,01:18:09.644,but you have to believe me.
01:18:09.644,01:18:11.395,I don't.
01:18:11.395,01:18:13.772,"You have to believe me. John, you have to trust me on this."
01:18:13.772,01:18:19.069,"I'll give you a week to go to rehab, or I'm leaving and I'm taking the kids with me."
01:18:19.069,01:18:21.447,"I think that's fair, okay?"
01:18:21.447,01:18:24.367,"I'll help you as much as I can, make it really easy."
01:18:24.367,01:18:26.118,Mom's gonna come in the afternoon.
01:18:26.118,01:18:29.246,All right?
01:18:29.246,01:18:31.332,I'm willing to try and figure this out.
01:18:31.332,01:18:32.667,But it's up to you.
01:18:32.667,01:18:34.877,I'll shoot Mommy if you tell.
01:18:56.232,01:18:59.026,"Max. Max, are you okay?"
01:18:59.776,01:19:01.028,What did she do?
01:19:01.028,01:19:03.698,Did she do something to make the car crash?
01:19:05.199,01:19:09.786,"If you saw her, you have to help me, so Mom and Dad can protect us."
01:19:12.164,01:19:13.999,Why not?
01:19:23.551,01:19:25.261,Is that Sister Abigail?
01:19:32.101,01:19:34.186,Max. What did she do in my tree house?
01:19:37.940,01:19:39.858,Are the bad things still there?
01:19:42.570,01:19:45.155,Everything's gonna be okay.
01:19:45.155,01:19:47.366,I'll get the stuff from the tree house.
01:19:47.366,01:19:49.535,Then they'll have to believe us.
01:20:36.873,01:20:38.751,"Going somewhere, Kate?"
01:20:38.751,01:20:40.419,What are you doing here?
01:20:40.419,01:20:43.005,She's fine. Let's not wake her.
01:20:43.005,01:20:45.299,Go to your room.
01:20:43.005,01:20:48.051,"Honestly, we're past that now."
01:20:48.051,01:20:50.471,I know what you're doing.
01:20:51.472,01:20:53.432,I will not let you hurt my children.
01:20:53.432,01:20:54.850,Me?
01:20:54.850,01:20:58.562,I'm not the one who passed out drunk and let Max almost drown in the pond.
01:20:58.562,01:21:04.193,"If it wasn't for John she'd be dead, and you'd probably still be in jail."
01:21:05.778,01:21:07.237,Who told you that?
01:21:09.782,01:21:10.991,It's very intimate.
01:21:10.991,01:21:12.909,I learned so much about you.
01:21:12.909,01:21:14.745,Give it to me.
01:21:14.745,01:21:17.665,Your cheating husband.
01:21:17.665,01:21:19.291,Where you hide your wine bottles.
01:21:19.291,01:21:22.002,I'm-- I'm warning you right now.
01:21:22.002,01:21:28.801,She was still kicking when the doctor told me it was something called phantom-- --fetal movement.
01:21:28.801,01:21:31.345,"For 16 days, Stop it."
01:21:31.345,01:21:32.805,I carried my dead baby.
01:21:32.805,01:21:36.099,It was the cruelest torture I could imagine.
01:21:36.099,01:21:38.728,Stop it. You stop it.
01:21:38.728,01:21:40.979,What's wrong with you?
01:21:40.979,01:21:43.858,"Kate, it's too late."
01:21:43.858,01:21:45.860,You took your family for granted.
01:21:46.736,01:21:48.028,What do you mean?
01:21:48.028,01:21:49.572,What are you going to do?
01:21:50.989,01:21:53.576,Hit me?
01:21:58.455,01:21:59.874,KATE: We adopted her from you.
01:21:59.874,01:22:01.625,How could you not know anything about her?
01:22:01.625,01:22:03.627,The Sullivans could have adopted her illegally.
01:22:03.627,01:22:06.463,She doesn't remember anything that could help us?
01:22:09.091,01:22:10.509,I'm gonna call you back.
01:23:28.921,01:23:31.089,Saarne Institute.
01:23:50.025,01:23:53.654,"Hello. Uh, do you speak English?"
01:23:55.405,01:23:56.406,Do you speak English?
01:23:56.406,01:23:57.825,"Is-- Uh, er-- I'm sorry."
01:23:57.825,01:23:59.493,Is there anyone who speaks English there?
01:23:59.493,01:24:01.662,This is very-- This is very important.
01:24:05.624,01:24:08.168,I don't know what you're saying.
01:24:20.305,01:24:22.766,Hello?
01:24:22.766,01:24:24.560,MAN: Yes.
01:24:24.560,01:24:30.357,Yes. I need to talk to somebody about one of your children. She was adopted by an American family.
01:24:30.357,01:24:31.817,It's a girl.
01:24:31.817,01:24:34.361,MAN: She is not come from here.
01:24:34.361,01:24:36.530,"Well, I haven't even told you her name yet."
01:24:36.530,01:24:37.781,You do not understand.
01:24:37.781,01:24:39.700,Saarne Institute is not an orphanage.
01:24:39.700,01:24:40.910,It is a mental hospital.
01:25:08.938,01:25:11.147,Are you looking for this?
01:25:13.108,01:25:15.694,Poor Sister Abigail.
01:25:15.694,01:25:17.905,"I couldn't have done it myself, you know."
01:25:17.905,01:25:20.991,Max is just as guilty as I am.
01:25:20.991,01:25:22.659,"Whatever Max did, you made her do it."
01:25:22.659,01:25:24.411,Think about it.
01:25:24.411,01:25:27.122,How did she even know what was up here?
01:25:27.122,01:25:31.501,It's always better to burn the evidence.
01:25:31.501,01:25:35.923,"If they find these things, they won't just be coming for me."
01:25:35.923,01:25:38.008,They'll be coming for Max too.
01:25:39.175,01:25:41.386,Is that really what you want?
01:25:42.930,01:25:44.514,What are you doing?
01:25:45.432,01:25:47.101,Are you crazy?
01:25:53.774,01:25:55.233,Let me out!
01:25:55.233,01:25:57.319,Let me out of here!
01:26:07.704,01:26:10.457,Mom!
01:26:10.457,01:26:13.127,KATE: It's called the Saarne Institute.
01:26:13.127,01:26:17.631,"S-A-A-R-N-E, Saarne. It's in Estonia."
01:26:17.631,01:26:20.509,Estonia?
01:26:20.509,01:26:22.302,All of her paperwork is from Russia.
01:26:22.302,01:26:24.054,I'm sending them a picture of her right now.
01:26:24.054,01:26:27.933,Try to find out wether maybe her birth mother was a patient there.
01:26:27.933,01:26:30.644,I don't know.
01:26:35.732,01:26:37.400,Mom!
01:26:38.735,01:26:40.445,Help!
01:26:58.463,01:27:00.090,Mom! Dad!
01:27:07.222,01:27:08.348,"Oh, God!"
01:27:17.774,01:27:18.775,"Oh, God."
01:27:18.775,01:27:20.194,Call 911!
01:27:31.997,01:27:34.166,Don't worry.
01:27:37.961,01:27:39.295,"KATE: Oh, God!"
01:27:41.381,01:27:44.718,"Oh, my God! Daniel!"
01:27:46.011,01:27:47.429,Move away!
01:27:47.429,01:27:49.056,Move away from the fire!
01:27:49.056,01:27:50.849,Daniel?
01:27:50.849,01:27:53.435,"Oh, God, no. Daniel?"
01:27:53.435,01:27:54.895,Can you hear me?
01:27:54.895,01:27:57.898,Please wake up.
01:27:57.898,01:28:00.776,You're gonna be all right.
01:28:10.619,01:28:15.707,"We stopped the abdominal bleeding, but he has a very serious neck injury."
01:28:15.707,01:28:17.251,He's stabilized for now.
01:28:17.251,01:28:19.211,You should consider yourselves very lucky.
01:28:19.211,01:28:20.796,Can we see him?
01:28:20.796,01:28:23.966,DOCTOR: In a little while.
01:28:23.966,01:28:27.469,Okay. And will he be able to tell us what happened?
01:28:27.469,01:28:31.640,It's possible. There's no way of knowing for sure what he'll remember until he wakes up.
01:28:33.058,01:28:34.935,DOCTOR: Excuse me.
01:28:37.604,01:28:39.564,It's gonna be okay.
01:28:43.026,01:28:47.322,"JOHN: I know you're exhausted and upset, and so am I."
01:28:47.322,01:28:49.616,"Obviously, there has to be some other explanation."
01:28:49.616,01:28:51.285,She didn't come from an insane asylum.
01:28:51.285,01:28:52.619,How do you know that?
01:28:52.619,01:28:55.747,The orphanage you thought she came from has never heard of her.
01:28:55.747,01:28:57.373,Everything about her could be a lie.
01:28:57.373,01:28:58.917,Everything.
01:28:57.373,01:29:03.172,"We have her passport, birth certificate, school records-- These are papers from halfway around the world."
01:29:03.172,01:29:05.381,What is this?
01:29:05.381,01:29:07.383,Your own mother was there this time.
01:29:07.383,01:29:09.344,It wasn't just me.
01:29:10.262,01:29:13.348,It's either Esther or Daniel who started the fire.
01:29:13.348,01:29:16.268,Who do you think it was?
01:29:16.268,01:29:19.271,I'm so done. I'm done connecting these dots for you.
01:29:19.271,01:29:21.773,"You know, you can think whatever you want about me."
01:29:21.773,01:29:23.233,I will leave tonight.
01:29:23.233,01:29:25.277,"If that's what you want, I will leave tonight."
01:29:25.277,01:29:27.529,On one condition.
01:29:31.616,01:29:33.743,Can I have a dollar for the soda machine?
01:29:33.743,01:29:36.330,Your mother wants you to stay right there.
01:29:43.586,01:29:46.464,There you go.
01:30:20.290,01:30:21.624,Okay.

01:31:33.029,01:31:35.740,Crash cart coming through!
01:31:35.740,01:31:37.326,Daniel?
01:31:37.326,01:31:38.785,You have to stay out here.
01:31:38.785,01:31:40.662,He's in cardiac arrest.
01:31:40.662,01:31:42.998,Daniel!
01:31:43.915,01:31:45.583,WOMAN: Here we go.
01:31:45.583,01:31:47.543,"WOMAN: Check BP, please."

01:31:54.634,01:31:55.927,Kate.

01:31:59.764,01:32:01.057,What did you do?
01:32:01.057,01:32:03.226,"What did you do to him, you bitch?"
01:32:03.226,01:32:04.518,"Stop, stop!"
01:32:04.518,01:32:05.854,NURSE: Orderlies!
01:32:05.854,01:32:07.521,KATE: She's trying to kill my baby!
01:32:07.521,01:32:09.232,Daddy!
01:32:09.232,01:32:11.567,She's trying to kill my baby!
01:32:12.444,01:32:14.070,Hold her still.
01:32:14.988,01:32:16.198,Get off me!

01:32:47.354,01:32:48.897,Daniel.
01:32:48.897,01:32:51.107,They're running tests.
01:32:51.107,01:32:53.443,Don't worry about Daniel.
01:32:54.694,01:32:56.196,He'll be home in a few days.
01:32:56.196,01:32:58.156,"You need to stay here overnight, get some rest."
01:32:58.156,01:33:00.409,I'm gonna take Max and Esther home.
01:33:00.409,01:33:02.244,Johnny.
01:33:04.079,01:33:06.580,Please don't let her near Max.
01:33:09.709,01:33:11.336,I love you.

01:36:41.879,01:36:44.340,What's going on?
01:36:49.803,01:36:52.432,You said you loved me.
01:36:53.516,01:36:55.310,Ohh.
01:36:57.895,01:37:01.149,You are so confused.
01:37:01.149,01:37:05.027,You know what?
01:37:05.027,01:37:08.615,That's the way Kate and I love each other.
01:37:11.075,01:37:12.744,You understand?
01:37:13.703,01:37:15.538,I don't see that.
01:37:16.914,01:37:18.792,You have to respect your mother.
01:37:18.792,01:37:20.293,I do.
01:37:20.293,01:37:23.171,I just feel like I'm alone sometimes in respecting you.
01:37:23.171,01:37:27.592,I don't think anyone ever thinks about what you might be feeling.
01:37:27.592,01:37:30.470,"I really care about you, John."
01:37:30.470,01:37:32.846,"Yeah, I know, Esther."

01:37:40.021,01:37:42.732,I'm very tired.
01:37:42.732,01:37:45.026,And I don't know what to do.
01:37:45.026,01:37:47.153,"I mean, everything is just falling apart."

01:38:17.933,01:38:19.644,Stop talking to me like I'm a child.
01:38:19.644,01:38:21.396,I'm calling Sister Judith tomorrow.
01:38:21.396,01:38:23.981,We're gonna have a conversation about your future in this house.

01:39:08.610,01:39:10.486,Is she someplace where she can hear you?
01:39:10.486,01:39:13.406,"No, she's not with me."
01:39:13.406,01:39:18.286,"Call your husband right now, and tell him to get your family out of the house."
01:39:18.286,01:39:19.788,And then call the police.
01:39:19.788,01:39:22.665,He won't listen to me. But why?
01:39:22.665,01:39:26.544,Then tell him the little girl in the picture is not really a little girl.
01:39:26.544,01:39:28.087,She's a grown woman.
01:39:28.087,01:39:29.547,What?
01:39:29.547,01:39:31.090,What are you talking about?
01:39:31.090,01:39:34.928,"The picture I sent you is of our adopted daughter, and she's 9 years old."
01:39:36.304,01:39:38.848,"No, she's not."
01:39:38.848,01:39:41.016,She has a rare hormone disorder.
01:39:41.016,01:39:43.478,It's called hypopituitarism.
01:39:43.478,01:39:46.606,It causes proportional dwarfism.
01:39:46.606,01:39:52.612,"According to our records, Leena Klammer was born in 1976."
01:39:52.612,01:39:54.530,She's 33 years old.
01:39:54.530,01:39:56.908,This can't be.
01:39:56.908,01:40:00.578,"VARAVA: I hope so, for your sake."
01:40:00.578,01:40:03.289,What? I don't know. What scars?
01:40:03.289,01:40:05.875,Leena was one of our most violent patients.
01:40:05.875,01:40:11.213,"When she was here, she was kept in a straitjacket to stop her from hurting our staff."
01:40:11.213,01:40:13.132,She was constantly fighting to get out.
01:40:13.132,01:40:17.846,It cut into her skin and left her with scars around her wrists and neck.
01:40:17.846,01:40:20.473,There is no way you could not have seen them.
01:40:20.473,01:40:22.057,Why was she at your hospital?
01:40:22.057,01:40:24.143,"VARAVA: She's dangerously ill, violent."
01:40:24.143,01:40:26.646,She killed seven people that we know of.
01:40:26.646,01:40:28.940,"Oh, my God."
01:40:28.940,01:40:33.611,VARAVA: She has been passing herself off as a little girl for most of her life.
01:40:33.611,01:40:37.198,She tricked a family here in Estonia into adopting her.
01:40:37.198,01:40:42.453,"When she couldn't seduce the father, she killed him and his whole family."
01:40:42.453,01:40:43.913,Then she burned the house down.
01:40:43.913,01:40:46.123,Yes. How did you know?
01:40:46.123,01:40:49.460,She disappeared a year ago and we lost track of her.
01:40:49.460,01:40:52.463,"If it's really Leena, you don't have much time."
01:41:33.755,01:41:35.214,Esther?
01:42:49.162,01:42:52.416,"Come on, Johnny. Come on."
01:43:02.135,01:43:04.053,Shit.
01:43:27.242,01:43:28.285,Come on.
01:43:28.911,01:43:30.621,"Oh, God!"
01:44:03.196,01:44:04.947,Come on.
01:44:07.324,01:44:09.451,Come on.
01:44:09.451,01:44:11.162,WOMAN: 911. What is your emergency?
01:44:11.162,01:44:13.497,I need the police.
01:44:47.698,01:44:48.908,Come on.
01:44:53.079,01:44:54.747,JOHN: This is John.
01:44:54.747,01:44:56.832,"You've reached my cell, but I can't pick up."
01:44:56.832,01:44:58.417,"Oh, fuck it."
01:46:14.910,01:46:16.329,John?
01:46:21.709,01:46:22.668,John?
01:46:22.668,01:46:24.003,John?
01:46:25.004,01:46:27.673,"No, God!"
01:46:41.603,01:46:42.771,"No, God!"
01:46:46.608,01:46:48.027,Max.
01:48:27.709,01:48:29.795,What the fuck?
01:51:00.946,01:51:03.407,Esther! Don't you hurt her!
01:51:08.745,01:51:11.582,Leave her alone! I'm here!
01:51:12.749,01:51:14.543,Esther!
01:52:45.008,01:52:46.385,I know.
01:54:42.042,01:54:44.837,Go back. It's too dangerous.
01:54:57.891,01:54:59.059,Please.
01:55:00.352,01:55:02.688,"Don't let me die, Mommy."
01:55:05.982,01:55:09.737,I'm not your fucking Mommy!
01:55:25.711,01:55:28.046,"Baby, it's okay."
