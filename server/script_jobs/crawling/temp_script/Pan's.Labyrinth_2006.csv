00:01:07.358,00:01:08.401,THE NEW FASCIST REGIME.
00:01:08.485,00:01:11.321,MILITARY POSTS ARE ESTABLISHED TO EXTERMINATE THE RESISTANCE.
00:01:34.260,00:01:50.193,"A long time ago, in the Underground Realm, where there are no lies or pain, there lived a princess who dreamt of the human world."
00:01:52.278,00:01:57.408,"She dreamt of blue skies, soft breeze, and sunshine."
00:02:02.539,00:02:07.794,"One day, eluding her keepers, the princess escaped."
00:02:12.882,00:02:20.056,"Once outside, the bright sun blinded her and erased her memory."
00:02:23.059,00:02:26.229,She forgot who she was and where she came from.
00:02:26.771,00:02:32.902,"Her body suffered cold, sickness, and pain."
00:02:34.404,00:02:44.831,"However, her father, the king, always knew that the Princess' soul would return, perhaps in another body, in another place, at another time."
00:02:45.498,00:02:52.463,"He would wait for her until he drew his last breath, until the world stopped turning."
00:03:01.472,00:03:04.267,"Why did you bring so many books, Ofelia?"
00:03:04.350,00:03:06.728,"We're going to the country, the outdoors."
00:03:12.275,00:03:13.860,Fairy tales?
00:03:14.360,00:03:18.364,You're a bit old to be filling your head with such nonsense.
00:03:21.576,00:03:23.202,Ask him to stop the car.
00:03:37.634,00:03:40.178,"Ofelia, wait."
00:03:40.678,00:03:42.263,Your brother's not well.
00:03:45.850,00:03:47.060,"Madam, are you okay?"
00:03:48.019,00:03:50.021,"Madam, do you need anything?"
00:03:54.776,00:03:57.987,Water. Water for the captain's wife.
00:03:58.071,00:03:59.072,Come on!
00:04:54.294,00:04:55.295,Ofelia?
00:04:57.714,00:05:00.717,"Ofelia, come here."
00:05:03.803,00:05:06.931,-I saw a fairy. -Just look at your shoes!
00:05:08.308,00:05:09.350,Let's go.
00:05:10.601,00:05:13.438,"When we get there, come out to greet the Captain."
00:05:13.521,00:05:15.064,I want you to call him Father.
00:05:15.773,00:05:18.234,You have no idea how good he's been to us.
00:05:19.652,00:05:22.864,"It's just a word, Ofelia."
00:05:48.848,00:05:50.433,"They're coming, Captain."
00:05:51.559,00:05:53.061,They're 15 minutes late.
00:06:11.079,00:06:12.080,Carmen.
00:06:19.670,00:06:20.671,Welcome.
00:06:25.885,00:06:28.096,"Please, don't. I can walk perfectly well."
00:06:28.721,00:06:31.140,The doctor says you must not exert yourself.
00:06:31.974,00:06:32.809,No.
00:06:34.769,00:06:35.770,Come on.
00:06:36.938,00:06:37.939,Do it for me.
00:06:43.236,00:06:44.278,Thank you.
00:06:46.030,00:06:47.198,"Ofelia, come out."
00:06:48.157,00:06:49.325,Say hello to the Captain.
00:06:54.288,00:06:55.289,Ofelia.
00:07:03.506,00:07:05.508,"It's the other hand, Ofelia."
00:07:09.470,00:07:10.513,Mercedes!
00:07:12.014,00:07:14.600,"-Bring the luggage. -Yes, sir."
00:08:20.500,00:08:21.459,It's a labyrinth.
00:08:25.421,00:08:30.468,A pile of old rocks that's always been here even before the mill.
00:08:31.511,00:08:33.971,You better not go in there. You might get lost.
00:08:35.014,00:08:36.015,Thank you.
00:08:36.766,00:08:38.059,Have you read them all?
00:08:38.559,00:08:39.393,Mercedes!
00:08:41.437,00:08:42.688,The Captain is calling for you.
00:08:45.191,00:08:46.609,Your father needs me.
00:08:49.111,00:08:50.488,He's not my father.
00:08:51.197,00:08:52.949,The Captain is not my father.
00:08:53.032,00:08:56.452,My father was a tailor. He died in the war.
00:08:56.536,00:08:57.745,The Captain is not my father.
00:08:59.080,00:09:01.624,You've made that clear enough. Shall we go?
00:09:02.542,00:09:03.793,Have you seen my mother?
00:09:04.585,00:09:06.128,-Isn't she beautiful? -Yes.
00:09:06.712,00:09:08.756,The baby is making her sick. Have you noticed?
00:09:26.941,00:09:30.820,The guerrillas are deep in the woods. It's hard to track them.
00:09:31.946,00:09:34.365,The scum knows the terrain better than us.
00:09:34.448,00:09:36.075,We'll block their access.
00:09:37.493,00:09:40.830,"We'll store food, medicine, and everything else here."
00:09:40.913,00:09:43.708,"That way, they will come to us."
00:09:43.791,00:09:45.585,We'll set up three new command posts.
00:09:45.668,00:09:49.714,"Here, here, and here."
00:09:49.797,00:09:50.631,Mercedes.
00:09:51.924,00:09:54.552,"-Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down. -Yes, sir."
00:09:59.098,00:10:01.183,This will help you sleep.
00:10:02.560,00:10:04.979,Just drink two drops before bed.
00:10:08.316,00:10:09.275,Two drops only.
00:10:11.902,00:10:12.737,Thank you.
00:10:14.655,00:10:16.866,All of it. Good.
00:10:19.410,00:10:22.663,Don't hesitate to call me any time of the day.
00:10:25.333,00:10:26.834,You or your nurse.
00:10:28.461,00:10:29.420,Good night.
00:10:30.588,00:10:32.923,Close the door and turn off the lights.
00:10:45.311,00:10:46.729,You have to go up and see him there.
00:10:47.271,00:10:50.358,His leg wound is getting worse.
00:10:54.487,00:10:56.072,This is all I could get.
00:10:56.739,00:10:57.615,I'm sorry.
00:10:59.575,00:11:01.452,Captain Vidal is waiting in his office.
00:11:27.812,00:11:29.021,"Come here, Ofelia."
00:11:41.283,00:11:44.495,"My gosh, your feet are ice-cold."
00:11:54.422,00:11:55.631,Are you afraid?
00:11:57.591,00:11:58.801,A little.
00:12:03.848,00:12:05.057,What's that noise?
00:12:05.141,00:12:08.310,"Nothing, it's just the wind."
00:12:09.562,00:12:12.690,Nights here are different from city nights.
00:12:13.774,00:12:16.694,"There, you hear cars and trains."
00:12:17.403,00:12:19.238,"Here, the houses are old."
00:12:20.823,00:12:25.828,They creak… as if they are speaking.
00:12:29.832,00:12:32.126,"Tomorrow, I'll give you a surprise."
00:12:33.043,00:12:34.211,A surprise?
00:12:36.213,00:12:40.342,-Is it a book? -No. It's something much better.
00:12:46.724,00:12:48.559,Why did you have to get married?
00:12:52.897,00:12:55.149,I was alone too long.
00:12:55.858,00:12:58.944,I'm with you. You weren't alone.
00:13:00.029,00:13:01.363,You were never alone.
00:13:03.949,00:13:07.578,"When you're older, you'll understand. It's been hard for me too."
00:13:11.457,00:13:13.292,Your brother's acting up.
00:13:14.210,00:13:16.212,Tell him one of your stories.
00:13:16.962,00:13:18.506,I'm sure that will calm down.
00:13:21.550,00:13:39.026,"My brother… Many, many years ago, in a sad, faraway land, there was an enormous mountain made of rough, black stone."
00:13:39.944,00:13:48.911,"At sunset, on top of that mountain, a magic rose blossomed that would make whoever plucked it immortal."
00:13:49.495,00:13:56.335,But no one dared to go near it because its thorns were full of poison.
00:14:05.886,00:14:23.153,Men talked amongst themselves about their fear of death and pain… but never about the promise of eternal life.
00:14:23.237,00:14:30.327,"And every day, the rose wilted, unable to bequeath its gift to anyone."
00:14:30.411,00:14:37.042,"forgotten and lost at the top of that cold, dark mountain, forever alone until the end of time."
00:14:49.972,00:14:50.890,Come in.
00:14:54.560,00:14:56.353,-How is she? -Very weak.
00:14:57.021,00:14:57.938,She'll have rest.
00:14:58.522,00:14:59.523,I'll sleep down here.
00:15:04.778,00:15:06.405,-And my son? -Sir?
00:15:06.488,00:15:07.948,"Excuse us, Captain."
00:15:10.367,00:15:12.578,"My son, how is he?"
00:15:13.245,00:15:15.205,There's no reason to be alarmed.
00:15:17.207,00:15:18.292,Very good.
00:15:20.127,00:15:25.132,"Captain, your wife shouldn't have traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy."
00:15:28.427,00:15:32.056,"-Is that your opinion? -My professional opinion, yes, sir."
00:15:35.225,00:15:37.478,A son should be born where his father is.
00:15:38.228,00:15:39.104,That's all.
00:15:41.732,00:15:43.192,"One more thing, Captain."
00:15:44.109,00:15:46.362,What makes you so sure the baby is a male?
00:15:48.656,00:15:49.657,Don't fuck with me.
00:15:51.241,00:15:54.119,We detected movement in the northwest sector at 8:00 p.m.
00:15:54.787,00:15:55.704,Gunfire.
00:15:58.707,00:16:02.086,Sergeant Bayona searched the area and captured a suspect.
00:16:02.711,00:16:04.672,The other one's his son.
00:16:04.755,00:16:07.174,"Captain, my father is an honorable man."
00:16:07.257,00:16:10.135,Let me judge that. Take your hat off in front of me.
00:16:11.136,00:16:14.056,We found this weapon on him. It's been fired.
00:16:14.139,00:16:15.683,My father was hunting rabbits.
00:16:15.766,00:16:17.434,"Again, keep quiet."
00:16:28.070,00:16:29.655,"No God, no country, no Master?"
00:16:30.197,00:16:34.368,"-How do you like that? -Red propaganda, Captain."
00:16:34.451,00:16:35.828,"It's not propaganda, sir."
00:16:37.037,00:16:39.164,"It's an old almanac, Captain."
00:16:40.290,00:16:41.959,We're just farmers.
00:16:43.502,00:16:44.336,Go on.
00:16:45.587,00:16:49.466,"I went up into the woods to hunt for rabbits, Captain."
00:16:50.092,00:16:51.760,They're for my sick daughters.
00:16:53.721,00:16:55.180,"Rabbits, uh?"
00:16:55.848,00:16:59.268,"Captain, if my father says so, he was hunting rabbits."
00:17:10.863,00:17:12.489,Leave him alone.
00:17:15.576,00:17:18.579,You killed him!
00:17:19.288,00:17:22.166,"You're a murderer, you son of a bitch!"
00:17:51.945,00:17:55.616,Search these assholes properly before you come bothering me.
00:17:56.200,00:17:57.117,"Yes, Captain."
00:18:17.596,00:18:18.430,Mother.
00:18:19.431,00:18:20.974,"Mother, wake up."
00:18:21.600,00:18:24.353,"Mother, there's something in the room."
00:19:06.353,00:19:07.187,Hello.
00:19:08.063,00:19:09.523,Did you follow me here?
00:19:10.232,00:19:11.233,Are you a fairy?
00:19:13.735,00:19:14.820,Look.
00:19:20.159,00:19:21.451,This is a fairy.
00:19:49.479,00:19:51.190,You want me to go with you?
00:19:52.774,00:19:55.027,Outside? Where?
00:21:13.230,00:21:14.523,Hello?
00:21:16.275,00:21:17.776,Hello?
00:21:35.711,00:21:37.838,Echo.
00:21:44.886,00:21:46.972,Echo.
00:21:49.850,00:21:51.810,Hello?
00:21:54.813,00:21:56.315,Hello?
00:21:58.859,00:22:00.360,It's you?
00:22:05.490,00:22:09.036,It's you. You've returned.
00:22:09.119,00:22:10.787,"Don't be frightened, I beg you."
00:22:12.164,00:22:13.790,Look.
00:22:22.382,00:22:24.801,My name is Ofelia. Who are you?
00:22:24.885,00:22:26.094,Me?
00:22:27.179,00:22:28.013,Me.
00:22:28.847,00:22:38.940,"I've had so many names, old names that only the wind and the trees can pronounce."
00:22:39.691,00:22:46.490,"I am the mountain, the forest, and the earth."
00:22:47.365,00:22:54.748,I am… I am a faun.
00:22:55.874,00:23:09.304,"-Your most humble servant, Your Highness. -No, I'm-- You're Princess Moanna, daughter of the king of the underworld."
00:23:09.387,00:23:10.680,My father was a tailor.
00:23:11.264,00:23:13.225,You are not born of man.
00:23:14.309,00:23:16.937,It was the moon that bore you.
00:23:17.020,00:23:22.484,"If you look at your left shoulder, you will find a mark that proves it."
00:23:22.984,00:23:32.452,Your real father had us open portals all over the world to allow your return.
00:23:33.245,00:23:38.125,This is… the last of them.
00:23:38.875,00:23:51.930,"But we have to make sure that your essence is intact, that you have not become a mortal."
00:23:55.642,00:24:01.398,You must complete three tasks before the moon is full.
00:24:04.234,00:24:09.990,This is The Book of Crossroads.
00:24:11.074,00:24:21.501,"Open it when you are alone, and it will show you your future and what must be done."
00:24:29.968,00:24:31.178,But there's nothing.
00:25:28.443,00:25:31.780,"Mercedes, prepare these rabbits for dinner tonight."
00:25:32.989,00:25:34.366,They are too young.
00:25:35.325,00:25:38.662,"-See if they'll do for a stew. -Yes, sir."
00:25:41.122,00:25:44.084,This coffee was burnt. Taste it yourself.
00:25:52.384,00:25:55.428,You should keep an eye on it.
00:25:57.055,00:25:58.348,"As you wish, sir."
00:26:04.938,00:26:05.981,Cook these.
00:26:07.774,00:26:10.235,-He hated the coffee. -He's so damn fussy!
00:26:10.318,00:26:13.405,-A fussy dandy! -We need more beef and chicken.
00:26:13.488,00:26:15.490,Where will we find it?
00:26:15.573,00:26:17.367,The doctor's wife and the mayor are coming.
00:26:17.450,00:26:20.161,They eat more than a couple of pigs.
00:26:21.746,00:26:25.166,-And they don't shut up. -Not even underwater.
00:26:40.181,00:26:42.058,"Mercedes, I'll be back in a moment."
00:26:47.397,00:26:48.273,Ofelia.
00:26:51.109,00:26:52.902,Your father is throwing a dinner tonight.
00:26:54.362,00:26:56.573,Look what I've made for you.
00:26:58.616,00:26:59.701,Do you like it?
00:27:01.578,00:27:06.666,What I wouldn't have given to have such a dress as fine as this when I was your age.
00:27:07.459,00:27:08.710,And look at these shoes.
00:27:09.836,00:27:12.756,"-Do you like them? -Yes, they're very pretty."
00:27:13.965,00:27:15.383,"Go on, now. Take a bath."
00:28:03.390,00:28:19.781,"ARBOR THE ANIMALS, MEN, AND WOMEN ALL SLEEP TOGETHER UNDER THE SHADOW OF A TREE NEAR THE WINDMILL."
00:28:20.365,00:28:21.241,Ofelia?
00:28:22.909,00:28:23.827,Ofelia?
00:28:25.078,00:28:28.623,Hurry up. I want to see the dress on you.
00:28:28.706,00:28:32.544,You must look lovely for the Captain.
00:28:34.379,00:28:35.713,You'll look like a princess.
00:28:40.427,00:28:41.636,A princess?
00:28:48.268,00:28:50.103,Clean those chickens properly.
00:28:50.186,00:28:52.355,And don't forget the beans.
00:28:55.692,00:29:00.029,"-You look marvelous, my girl. -You're beautiful."
00:29:02.574,00:29:04.826,Get back to work. Stop wasting time.
00:29:07.954,00:29:09.581,Do you want some milk?
00:29:15.003,00:29:18.882,"Move back, don't get your dress dirty. You look so pretty."
00:29:21.259,00:29:24.179,Mercedes. Do you believe in fairies?
00:29:26.306,00:29:27.307,No.
00:29:28.099,00:29:32.187,"I did when I was little, but I believed in a lot of things."
00:29:34.439,00:29:36.107,"Last night, a fairy visited me."
00:29:37.150,00:29:37.984,Really?
00:29:39.444,00:29:42.489,"Yes, and there were three of them."
00:29:42.572,00:29:44.657,-There was a faun too. -A faun?
00:29:44.741,00:29:48.578,"He was very old, very tall, and smelled like earth."
00:29:49.662,00:29:53.041,My mother warned me to be wary of fauns.
00:29:53.124,00:29:54.000,Mercedes!
00:29:56.002,00:29:57.003,Come with me.
00:29:59.130,00:30:01.049,"-The provisions. -Yes, they finally arrived."
00:30:02.550,00:30:03.843,Wait.
00:30:07.680,00:30:09.432,"Captain, everything is here."
00:30:09.516,00:30:15.438,"Flour, salt, oil, medicine, olives, bacon."
00:30:16.856,00:30:18.691,Tobacco.
00:30:19.651,00:30:20.819,And the ration cards.
00:30:21.402,00:30:23.655,-You must check the inventory. -Very well.
00:30:27.116,00:30:27.992,Mercedes.
00:30:29.410,00:30:31.246,"-The key. -Yes, sir."
00:30:38.461,00:30:40.463,"-Is this the only copy? -Yes, it's the only one."
00:30:40.547,00:30:41.965,"From now on, I'll carry it."
00:30:43.174,00:30:44.133,Captain.
00:30:49.973,00:30:51.558,"Captain, perhaps it's nothing."
00:30:59.941,00:31:00.900,It's them.
00:31:12.662,00:31:22.839,"Once upon a time, when the forest was young, it was home to creatures who were full of magic and wonder."
00:31:29.637,00:31:38.313,"They protected one another, and slept in the shade of a large fig tree that grew on a hill near the mill."
00:31:40.857,00:31:42.609,"But now, the tree is dying."
00:31:43.109,00:31:46.654,"Its branches are dry, and its trunk old and twisted."
00:31:47.488,00:31:52.410,A monstrous toad has settled in its roots and won't let the tree thrive.
00:31:53.912,00:32:00.835,Force the magic stones into the toad's mouth and take the golden key from inside its belly.
00:32:01.794,00:32:04.714,Only then will the fig tree flourish again.
00:33:31.300,00:33:33.094,They were here only minutes ago.
00:33:33.928,00:33:35.388,They left in a hurry.
00:33:42.729,00:33:44.564,"A dozen men, at most."
00:34:03.708,00:34:05.001,Antibiotics.
00:34:06.294,00:34:09.297,"Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket."
00:34:11.466,00:34:12.675,They're here.
00:34:15.803,00:34:20.308,"Those sons of bitches are here, and they're watching us."
00:34:31.027,00:34:32.278,Hey!
00:34:34.197,00:34:36.574,You left this behind!
00:34:37.408,00:34:39.911,And your lottery ticket!
00:34:39.994,00:34:42.038,Why don't you come back and get it?
00:34:42.747,00:34:45.083,Who knows? This could be your lucky day!
00:35:56.112,00:36:01.868,"I'm Princess Moanna, and I'm not afraid of you."
00:36:05.371,00:36:14.505,"Aren't you ashamed living down here, eating all these bugs, and growing fat while the tree dies?"
00:38:57.168,00:38:59.587,Have you checked in the pantry and the wine cellar?
00:38:59.670,00:39:00.588,"Yes, madam."
00:39:04.425,00:39:05.843,Have you checked the garden?
00:39:06.427,00:39:07.970,"-And the barn? -Yes, ma'am."
00:39:09.013,00:39:10.598,Where has she run off to?
00:39:10.681,00:39:11.849,"This way, please."
00:39:12.975,00:39:15.978,"Let me introduce you to my wife, Carmen."
00:39:17.813,00:39:19.607,-Nice to meet you. -A pleasure to meet you.
00:39:20.399,00:39:23.486,"From now on, we'll have one ration card per family."
00:39:24.236,00:39:25.488,Take a look.
00:39:25.571,00:39:27.782,-One? -Only one.
00:39:28.449,00:39:30.451,"Captain, I'm not sure it'll be enough."
00:39:30.534,00:39:34.830,If people are careful-- We can't allow anyone to send food to the guerillas.
00:39:34.914,00:39:38.626,"They're losing ground, and one of them is wounded."
00:39:39.835,00:39:42.546,"Excuse me, Captain. How can you be so sure?"
00:39:42.630,00:39:45.383,We almost got them. We found this.
00:39:46.008,00:39:46.842,Antibiotics.
00:39:48.469,00:39:50.721,God has already taken care of their souls.
00:39:51.305,00:39:54.100,Their bodies hardly matter to Him.
00:39:54.183,00:39:56.811,"We'll help however we can, Captain."
00:39:56.894,00:39:58.854,We know you're not here by choice.
00:40:03.150,00:40:04.360,You're wrong about that.
00:40:05.528,00:40:09.323,"I want my son to be born in a new, cleansed Spain."
00:40:10.199,00:40:15.287,Because these people hold the mistaken belief that we're all equal.
00:40:15.871,00:40:20.084,But there's a big difference: the war is over and we won.
00:40:20.960,00:40:27.133,"And if we need to kill every one of them, then we'll kill them all, and that's that."
00:40:28.092,00:40:29.885,We're all here by choice.
00:40:31.178,00:40:33.222,-By choice! -By choice!
00:40:36.058,00:40:39.019,Put the coffee on. I'm going for more wood.
00:40:39.103,00:40:40.563,We'll take care of it.
00:41:08.007,00:41:09.216,Ofelia?
00:41:21.061,00:41:23.856,How did you and the Captain meet?
00:41:26.317,00:41:29.195,Ofelia's father used to make the Captain's uniforms.
00:41:29.278,00:41:30.321,"Oh, I see."
00:41:30.821,00:41:35.075,"And after he died, I went to work at the shop."
00:41:35.159,00:41:42.082,"A little more than a year ago, the Captain and I met again."
00:41:42.166,00:41:43.542,"Amazing, isn't it?"
00:41:44.043,00:41:46.921,"I mean, finding each other again?"
00:41:48.589,00:41:51.342,"Oh, yes, so amazing."
00:41:51.425,00:41:54.887,"Please, forgive my wife. She isn't used to company."
00:41:55.554,00:41:57.806,She thinks her silly stories interest us all.
00:41:59.475,00:42:00.643,We understand.
00:42:03.020,00:42:05.314,"Madam, they have found the girl."
00:42:05.898,00:42:06.941,Excuse me.
00:42:18.160,00:42:20.454,Have I told you I met your father?
00:42:21.580,00:42:22.998,No. I had no idea.
00:42:25.751,00:42:26.877,I met him in Morocco.
00:42:27.670,00:42:30.631,"It was only brief, but he left a vivid impression."
00:42:30.714,00:42:31.757,He's an excellent soldier.
00:42:32.383,00:42:41.600,"General Vidal's men said that before he died on the battlefield, he smashed his watch so his son would know the exact hour of his death."
00:42:43.018,00:42:44.979,So he'd know how a brave man dies.
00:42:48.357,00:42:50.985,Nonsense. He didn't own a watch.
00:42:52.695,00:42:55.781,What you've done hurts me.
00:42:57.241,00:42:59.785,"After your bath, you'll go to bed without supper."
00:43:01.912,00:43:03.038,Are you listening?
00:43:06.500,00:43:09.003,"Sometimes, I think you'll never learn to behave."
00:43:10.045,00:43:11.797,"You've disappointed me, Ofelia."
00:43:14.133,00:43:15.676,You've disappointed your father too.
00:43:16.927,00:43:18.262,Do you mean the Captain?
00:43:19.346,00:43:20.598,Him more than me.
00:43:36.155,00:43:37.531,I've got the key.
00:43:41.285,00:43:42.911,Take me to the Labyrinth.
00:44:36.256,00:44:37.132,Hello.
00:44:39.093,00:44:40.678,I got the key out.
00:44:41.804,00:44:46.642,"That's me, and the girl is you."
00:44:47.184,00:44:48.352,And the baby?
00:44:49.728,00:44:51.939,So you retrieved the key.
00:44:54.608,00:44:56.110,I'm glad.
00:45:04.785,00:45:08.330,She believed in you from the very beginning.
00:45:09.331,00:45:12.000,She's so glad you succeeded.
00:45:17.923,00:45:19.258,Keep the key.
00:45:19.925,00:45:23.262,You'll be needing it very soon.
00:45:23.345,00:45:28.475,You'll be needing this piece of chalk too.
00:45:29.601,00:45:37.901,"Two tasks remain, and the moon is almost full."
00:45:37.985,00:45:39.611,Be patient.
00:45:39.695,00:45:48.662,We'll soon be strolling through the seven circular gardens of your palace.
00:45:48.745,00:45:50.247,Why would I believe you?
00:45:51.331,00:45:56.920,Why would a poor little faun like me lie to you?
00:46:19.359,00:46:20.277,Proceed.
00:46:21.612,00:46:24.198,Have your cards ready for inspection.
00:46:24.281,00:46:26.909,Let's go. Your name?
00:46:26.992,00:46:28.994,Sofía Agravios.
00:46:30.662,00:46:31.872,Your name?
00:46:32.789,00:46:36.793,Narciso Pena Soriano at your service.
00:46:37.336,00:46:38.879,Your name?
00:46:40.380,00:46:44.843,Our daily bread in Franco's Spain kept safe in this mill!
00:46:45.344,00:46:52.976,"The Reds lie because in a united Spain, there's not a single home without fire or bread."
00:47:07.032,00:47:10.536,"Come on, show me what happens now."
00:47:11.203,00:47:12.120,Show me.
00:47:33.433,00:47:34.476,Help!
00:47:41.900,00:47:42.901,Ofelia!
00:47:48.407,00:47:51.743,"Ofelia… Ofelia, help me."
00:47:54.454,00:47:57.624,Our daily bread in Franco's Spain. The bread we stored in our barn.
00:47:57.708,00:47:59.543,Captain!
00:47:59.626,00:48:02.170,Commies lie when they say there is hunger in Spain.
00:48:02.254,00:48:03.088,Come quickly.
00:48:03.171,00:48:09.469,"…because in a united Spain, there's not a single home without fire or bread."
00:48:10.012,00:48:12.306,Our daily bread in Franco's Spain.
00:48:15.100,00:48:18.186,Your wife needs uninterrupted rest.
00:48:19.980,00:48:22.774,She will have to be sedated most of the time.
00:48:25.027,00:48:27.487,The girl should sleep somewhere else.
00:48:29.156,00:48:30.866,I'll stay until she gives birth.
00:48:31.617,00:48:32.534,Make her well.
00:48:33.994,00:48:36.204,I'll pay whatever it costs and give whatever you need.
00:48:40.709,00:48:41.627,Make her well.
00:49:02.814,00:49:04.107,Don't worry.
00:49:05.400,00:49:07.903,"Your mother will get better soon, you'll see."
00:49:11.323,00:49:12.866,Having a baby is complicated.
00:49:13.659,00:49:16.870,Then I'll never have one.
00:49:29.383,00:49:32.219,"You're helping the men in the woods, aren't you?"
00:49:43.814,00:49:45.273,Have you told anyone?
00:49:46.817,00:49:48.110,"No, I haven't."
00:49:50.153,00:49:52.322,I don't want anything to happen to you.
00:50:03.083,00:50:04.292,Nor I to you.
00:50:05.961,00:50:07.713,Do you know a lullaby?
00:50:10.090,00:50:11.174,Only one.
00:50:12.342,00:50:14.261,But I don't remember the words.
00:50:14.845,00:50:17.931,I don't care. I still want to hear it.
00:51:11.651,00:51:14.654,Don't be afraid. It's only me.
00:51:23.288,00:51:25.540,-Are you ready? -Yes.
00:51:26.541,00:51:27.584,Then let's go.
00:51:32.672,00:51:33.965,This is sheer madness.
00:51:34.633,00:51:37.511,"When he finds out about us, he'll kill us all."
00:51:37.594,00:51:40.555,"-Have you thought about that? -Are you so afraid of him, doctor?"
00:51:41.264,00:51:42.849,I'm not.
00:51:43.683,00:51:44.935,At least not for myself.
00:51:56.696,00:51:57.614,Pedro!
00:51:58.615,00:52:00.867,"Pedro, my brother."
00:52:17.592,00:52:19.845,You didn't carry out the task.
00:52:19.928,00:52:23.306,"No, my mother is sick."
00:52:24.683,00:52:27.394,That's no excuse for negligence.
00:52:27.477,00:52:36.486,"Look, this is a mandrake root, a plant that dreamt of being human."
00:52:37.445,00:52:45.745,Put it under your mother's bed in a bowl of fresh milk.
00:52:46.288,00:52:51.543,"Each morning, give it two drops of blood."
00:52:51.626,00:52:56.006,We have no time to waste now.
00:52:56.089,00:52:58.717,The full moon will be upon us.
00:53:01.219,00:53:03.597,Take my pets to guide you through.
00:53:04.306,00:53:08.310,"You're going to a very dangerous place, so be careful."
00:53:08.393,00:53:16.109,The thing that sleeps there… is not human.
00:53:19.988,00:53:24.576,You will see a sumptuous feast.
00:53:24.659,00:53:32.250,"But don't eat or drink anything, absolutely nothing."
00:53:33.752,00:53:37.005,Your life depends on it.
00:53:58.276,00:54:02.989,"I've brought some Orujo, tobacco, and cheese."
00:54:03.823,00:54:05.992,Mail for Trigo and Piloto.
00:54:07.077,00:54:08.578,Powder for lice.
00:54:08.662,00:54:10.121,Let's see how that leg's doing.
00:54:10.747,00:54:14.250,How do you think it's doing? It's fucked up.
00:54:14.834,00:54:15.794,Let's see.
00:54:19.756,00:54:33.937,"North American, British, and Canadian troops disembarked on a small beach in the North of F… -It's France, you idiot. -France."
00:54:34.020,00:54:44.906,"More than 150,000 soldiers give us hope under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower… Is it really bad, doctor?"
00:54:45.907,00:54:47.450,"Look, Frenchie."
00:54:48.952,00:54:50.161,There's no way to save it.
00:55:02.465,00:55:05.510,I'll do as few cuts as possible.
00:55:13.226,00:55:14.811,"Wait for a second, doctor."
00:55:15.520,00:55:16.521,Just a second.
00:55:51.848,00:55:57.353,Use the chalk to trace a door anywhere in your room.
00:56:03.151,00:56:06.529,"Once the door's open, start the hourglass."
00:56:09.407,00:56:11.326,Let the fairies guide you.
00:56:16.748,00:56:24.798,Don't eat or drink anything and come back before the last grain of sand falls.
00:58:33.927,00:58:34.928,No.
00:58:37.931,00:58:39.140,This one.
01:01:15.129,01:01:16.547,No!
01:02:32.457,01:02:34.167,We'll soon have reinforcements.
01:02:34.876,01:02:38.796,Fifty men or more. Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.
01:02:39.672,01:02:42.175,And then what?
01:02:42.925,01:02:46.554,"If you kill him, they'll send another just like him and another."
01:02:47.263,01:02:49.849,"You're screwed. You have no guns, no safe shelter."
01:02:50.600,01:02:54.979,You need food and medicine. You must take care of Mercedes.
01:02:55.062,01:02:56.773,"If you love her, take her away."
01:02:56.856,01:02:59.317,"-This is a lost cause. -I'm staying, doctor."
01:02:59.400,01:03:00.485,That's it.
01:03:12.914,01:03:13.956,You have to leave.
01:03:15.708,01:03:18.836,"Here's the key, but you can't go down there now."
01:03:18.920,01:03:20.630,It's exactly what he expects.
01:03:24.175,01:03:25.384,Leave it to me.
01:03:29.347,01:03:30.765,I'm a coward.
01:03:31.766,01:03:34.268,"No, you're not."
01:03:35.436,01:03:36.604,"Yes, I am."
01:03:37.438,01:03:45.863,"I'm a coward for living with that son of a bitch, doing his laundry, making his bed, and feeding him."
01:03:49.617,01:03:52.078,What if the doctor's right?
01:03:56.374,01:03:58.543,We'll make things harder for that bastard.
01:04:04.549,01:04:05.550,Left!
01:05:53.532,01:05:54.742,Captain Vidal.
01:05:56.577,01:05:59.372,"I don't understand, her temperature's down."
01:05:59.956,01:06:01.332,But she still has a fever?
01:06:01.415,01:06:04.210,It's a good sign. Her body's fighting.
01:06:06.170,01:06:07.129,Listen to me.
01:06:07.838,01:06:10.675,"If you have to choose, save the baby."
01:06:11.258,01:06:13.636,"That boy will bear my name, my father's name."
01:06:13.719,01:06:14.762,Save him.
01:06:50.548,01:06:51.549,Brother.
01:06:53.551,01:06:54.552,Little brother.
01:06:56.804,01:07:01.726,"If you can hear me, I want you to know that things out here aren't too good."
01:07:03.561,01:07:05.688,You'll have to come out soon.
01:07:06.772,01:07:08.524,You've made Mother very sick.
01:07:10.651,01:07:14.530,I want to ask you one favor for when you come out.
01:07:15.531,01:07:16.657,Just one.
01:07:17.950,01:07:19.368,Don't hurt her.
01:07:20.703,01:07:23.831,"You'll meet her, she's very pretty."
01:07:24.749,01:07:27.209,She's sad for some days though.
01:07:28.169,01:07:33.257,"But when she smiles, you'll love her."
01:07:35.468,01:07:40.681,"Listen, if you do what I say, I'll make you a promise."
01:07:41.557,01:07:45.269,"I'll take you back to my kingdom, and I'll make you a prince."
01:07:46.312,01:07:49.148,"I promise you, a prince."
01:08:16.050,01:08:18.677,"I sounded the whistle, but they wouldn't move."
01:08:18.761,01:08:21.263,"I tried to stop, but it was too late."
01:08:21.347,01:08:25.226,"We jumped out just in time, but look at the mess!"
01:08:28.646,01:08:30.648,What did they steal?
01:08:30.731,01:08:32.274,They took nothing.
01:08:32.858,01:08:34.360,What the hell are you saying?
01:08:34.443,01:08:36.737,They just made a mess. They didn't open any wagon.
01:08:36.821,01:08:41.492,-They didn't take anything. -Nothing? Are you sure?
01:08:41.575,01:08:45.246,They were just trying to waste our time.
01:09:02.388,01:09:04.140,"They came out of nowhere, Captain."
01:09:07.643,01:09:10.563,"They have grenades, they're coming from uphill."
01:09:15.192,01:09:18.154,We've surrounded one unit that fell behind.
01:09:18.237,01:09:19.738,They took cover up on the hill.
01:09:54.773,01:09:56.567,"Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid."
01:09:56.650,01:09:59.695,This is the only decent way to die.
01:10:43.113,01:10:44.156,Serrano!
01:11:01.590,01:11:05.010,Let me see.
01:11:09.390,01:11:10.432,Can you talk?
01:11:14.853,01:11:15.771,Damn it!
01:11:34.581,01:11:48.887,"They are useless. One alive… Captain, this one's still alive."
01:11:53.100,01:11:54.560,He's only shot in the leg.
01:12:00.482,01:12:01.817,-What is it? -They caught one.
01:12:01.900,01:12:04.111,They're taking him to the storeroom.
01:12:09.408,01:12:10.534,Mercedes!
01:12:11.452,01:12:32.139,Pedro… Mercedes?
01:12:33.140,01:12:35.809,-I need to get into the storeroom. -Not now.
01:12:36.352,01:12:37.227,Move away!
01:13:05.172,01:13:07.132,"That's plenty, dear."
01:13:10.677,01:13:11.804,Should I take this up?
01:13:32.116,01:13:34.118,"Here, it's just half the dose."
01:13:35.119,01:13:36.995,I don't think I need it.
01:13:37.079,01:13:40.332,"I feel better, much better."
01:13:40.416,01:13:42.251,"I don't understand how, but I'm glad."
01:13:46.130,01:14:03.814,"Mother… Damn, this cigarette is good!"
01:14:04.940,01:14:08.235,Good-quality tobacco is really hard to find.
01:14:10.154,01:14:12.156,Fuck you.
01:14:14.992,01:14:18.620,The one we caught turns out to be a stutterer.
01:14:19.538,01:14:21.248,We'll be here all night.
01:14:21.874,01:14:23.292,As long as he talks.
01:14:29.590,01:14:30.757,Garces is right.
01:14:32.176,01:14:34.011,"You're going to tell us everything, right?"
01:14:35.179,01:14:38.640,I brought along a few tools to make sure that happens.
01:14:40.893,01:14:42.060,"At first, I won't trust you."
01:14:43.395,01:14:49.526,"But after I use this, you'll own up to a few things."
01:14:51.778,01:15:01.163,"When we get to these, we'll have developed… How can I put this? A bond almost like brothers."
01:15:02.456,01:15:03.290,You'll see.
01:15:06.001,01:15:10.881,"And when we get to this one, I'll believe anything you tell me."
01:15:23.685,01:15:25.145,I'll make you a deal.
01:15:25.229,01:15:30.234,"If you can count to three without stuttering, you can go."
01:15:32.402,01:15:35.072,"Don't look at him, look at me."
01:15:35.572,01:15:37.115,There's no one above me.
01:15:38.200,01:15:39.952,"-Garces! -Yes, Captain?"
01:15:40.035,01:15:43.372,"If I say this asshole can go, would anybody contradict me?"
01:15:43.455,01:15:45.290,"No one, Captain. He can leave."
01:15:45.999,01:15:50.045,There you have it. Count to three.
01:16:06.562,01:16:09.189,-One. -Good.
01:16:13.277,01:16:14.278,Two.
01:16:16.029,01:16:18.740,"One more, and you will be free."
01:16:24.413,01:16:36.800,Three… Too bad.
01:16:48.729,01:16:52.816,"Your mother is much better, Your Highness."
01:16:54.359,01:17:00.907,You must be relieved.
01:17:00.991,01:17:02.743,"Yes, thank you."
01:17:03.410,01:17:07.039,But things haven't turned out so well.
01:17:07.122,01:17:08.707,They haven't?
01:17:10.751,01:17:14.004,-I had an accident. -An accident?
01:17:14.087,01:17:15.255,Yes.
01:17:24.681,01:17:27.351,-You broke the rules! -I only ate two grapes!
01:17:27.434,01:17:29.353,I thought no one would notice.
01:17:30.771,01:17:33.940,-We've made a mistake! -A mistake?
01:17:34.691,01:17:38.195,You failed. You can never return.
01:17:38.278,01:17:42.157,-It was an accident! -You cannot return.
01:17:42.240,01:17:45.702,The moon will be full in three days.
01:17:46.828,01:17:52.209,Your spirit shall forever remain among humans.
01:17:52.292,01:17:56.546,"You shall age like them, and you shall die like them."
01:17:56.630,01:18:04.971,"All memory of you shall fade in time, and we'll vanish along with it."
01:18:05.806,01:18:09.476,You will never see us again.
01:18:20.237,01:18:21.405,"Good day, doctor."
01:18:22.072,01:18:26.201,"Sorry to wake you so early, but I think we need your help."
01:18:49.683,01:18:51.268,"My God, what have you done to him?"
01:18:51.351,01:18:52.185,Not much.
01:18:54.604,01:18:56.106,But things are getting better.
01:19:04.406,01:19:06.032,"I like having you here, doctor."
01:19:07.451,01:19:08.827,It has its advantages.
01:19:10.412,01:19:11.705,"Serrano, stay here."
01:19:12.247,01:19:13.206,I talked.
01:19:14.541,01:19:15.584,Not much.
01:19:18.211,01:19:21.506,-But I talked. -I'm sorry.
01:19:22.466,01:19:23.550,I'm so sorry.
01:19:31.224,01:19:36.021,"Kill me. Kill me now, please."
01:19:52.454,01:19:54.122,Son of a bitch.
01:20:15.101,01:20:16.770,It'll take away the pain.
01:20:23.401,01:20:24.528,It's almost over.
01:20:33.745,01:20:36.832,"Keep an eye on the doctor, -I'll be there in a minute. -Yes, Captain."
01:21:00.188,01:21:01.815,You're not moving anymore.
01:21:03.316,01:21:04.526,Are you sick?
01:21:08.238,01:21:10.907,What are you doing down there?
01:21:23.962,01:21:25.922,-Call him! -Who?
01:21:26.006,01:21:28.049,"Who else, you imbecile? Ferreiro!"
01:21:52.449,01:21:54.159,What the hell is this?
01:21:57.495,01:22:02.292,"-No! -Leave her. Leave her alone, please!"
01:22:04.669,01:22:07.213,Look what she was hiding under your bed.
01:22:07.297,01:22:08.673,What do you think of this?
01:22:13.595,01:22:17.891,What is this thing doing under the bed?
01:22:17.974,01:22:22.187,It's a magic root the faun gave me.
01:22:22.270,01:22:24.522,It's all that junk that you let her read.
01:22:25.231,01:22:26.316,Look what you've done!
01:22:26.399,01:22:30.153,"Please, leave us alone. I'll talk to her, darling."
01:22:30.987,01:22:31.947,Fine.
01:22:32.906,01:22:33.865,As you wish.
01:22:35.700,01:22:38.453,"He told me you would get better, and you did."
01:22:38.536,01:22:41.706,"Ofelia, you have to listen to your father."
01:22:42.916,01:22:44.125,You have to stop all this.
01:22:44.793,01:22:47.545,No. I want to leave this place!
01:22:47.629,01:22:49.464,"Please, take me away from here!"
01:22:49.547,01:22:53.051,-Please! -Things are not that simple.
01:22:55.512,01:23:01.601,"You're getting older, so you'll see that life isn't like your fairy tales."
01:23:02.435,01:23:04.270,The world is a cruel place.
01:23:05.981,01:23:09.609,You'll learn that even if it hurts.
01:23:11.152,01:23:13.405,-No! -Ofelia!
01:23:14.990,01:23:20.078,"Magic does not exist. Not for you, me, or anyone else."
01:23:31.923,01:23:34.009,Mom! Help!
01:23:34.634,01:23:35.927,Help!
01:23:36.845,01:23:38.054,Help!
01:23:44.227,01:23:45.353,Why did you do it?
01:23:47.397,01:23:49.107,It was the only thing I could do.
01:23:50.483,01:23:52.819,No. You could have obeyed me.
01:23:54.487,01:23:56.781,"I could have, but I didn't."
01:23:58.700,01:24:01.202,It would have been better for you.
01:24:02.620,01:24:05.915,I don't understand. Why didn't you obey me?
01:24:05.999,01:24:11.796,"To obey like that, for the sake of obeying, without questioning."
01:24:13.757,01:24:17.010,"Only people like you can do that, Captain."
01:24:54.130,01:24:55.048,Captain!
01:25:02.013,01:25:04.682,Garces! Call the troop paramedic.
01:25:04.766,01:25:06.476,"-Tell him to come immediately! -Yes, Captain."
01:25:41.719,01:25:43.513,Your wife is dead.
01:25:53.356,01:25:56.109,Because the paths to the Lord are inscrutable.
01:25:57.193,01:26:02.240,And the essence of His forgiveness lies in His word and in His mystery.
01:26:03.491,01:26:08.746,"Because although God sends us the message, it is our task to decipher it."
01:26:09.956,01:26:12.167,Far away now is the soul in its eternal glory.
01:26:12.250,01:26:20.800,"The earth takes in only a hollow, and a senseless shell… and the state of grace that we lose at our birth."
01:26:22.135,01:26:28.933,"Because God, in His infinite wisdom, puts the solution in our hands."
01:26:30.560,01:26:46.784,And because only in His physical absence… is the place He occupies in our souls is reaffirmed.
01:27:08.806,01:27:12.393,"You knew Dr. Ferreiro pretty well, didn't you, Mercedes?"
01:27:13.394,01:27:14.812,"We all knew him, sir."
01:27:14.896,01:27:16.481,Everyone around here.
01:27:18.316,01:27:21.903,The stutterer spoke of an informer who is here at the mill.
01:27:23.154,01:27:26.616,Can you imagine? Right under my nose.
01:27:28.743,01:27:31.996,"Mercedes, please."
01:27:41.839,01:27:43.341,What do you think of me?
01:27:44.634,01:27:46.302,You must think I'm some kind of a monster.
01:27:46.803,01:27:49.555,"It doesn't matter what someone like me thinks, sir."
01:27:59.816,01:28:02.902,Go to the storeroom and bring me more liquor.
01:28:02.986,01:28:05.905,"Yes, sir. Goodnight, sir."
01:28:06.823,01:28:07.782,Mercedes.
01:28:09.492,01:28:10.660,Are you forgetting something?
01:28:11.703,01:28:12.662,Sir?
01:28:17.834,01:28:18.751,The key.
01:28:19.752,01:28:21.879,"I have the only copy, don't I?"
01:28:23.256,01:28:24.132,"Yes, sir."
01:28:25.758,01:28:30.096,"You know, there's an odd detail that's been bothering me."
01:28:30.179,01:28:39.022,"Maybe it's not important, but when they broke into the storeroom with all those grenades and explosives, the lock wasn't forced open."
01:28:41.232,01:28:44.444,"As I said, it's probably not important."
01:28:48.406,01:28:49.574,Be very careful.
01:28:51.784,01:28:52.994,"Good night, sir."
01:29:36.037,01:29:38.790,Ofelia!
01:29:38.873,01:29:40.792,"Ofelia, I'm leaving tonight."
01:29:41.542,01:29:48.091,-Where to? -I can't tell you. I can't tell you… -Take me with you. -No. I can't.
01:29:48.174,01:29:51.302,"I can't, my child. But I'll come back for you, I promise."
01:29:51.385,01:29:52.595,Take me with you.
01:30:17.495,01:30:18.830,I heard something.
01:30:23.835,01:30:26.879,"It's nothing, don't worry."
01:30:36.222,01:30:37.223,Mercedes.
01:30:39.433,01:30:40.268,Ofelia.
01:30:49.527,01:30:50.903,How long have you known?
01:30:56.534,01:30:59.662,"How long have you been mocking me, you little bitch?"
01:31:00.830,01:31:01.956,Watch her!
01:31:05.710,01:31:09.755,"And if anyone tries to get in, kill her first."
01:31:24.437,01:31:25.354,Dry meat.
01:31:28.900,01:31:29.734,Tobacco.
01:31:31.152,01:31:34.071,"Had you asked, I would have given this to you."
01:31:41.162,01:31:43.206,I want the names of those who wrote these letters.
01:31:45.166,01:31:47.501,I want them in front of me tomorrow.
01:31:47.585,01:31:48.711,"Yes, Captain."
01:31:51.631,01:31:52.924,"You can go, Garces."
01:31:54.634,01:31:55.968,"Are you sure, Captain?"
01:31:58.346,01:32:01.224,"For God's sake, she's just a woman."
01:32:05.186,01:32:06.979,That's what you've always thought.
01:32:08.397,01:32:10.107,That's how I got away with it.
01:32:11.609,01:32:13.236,I was invisible to you.
01:32:14.528,01:32:15.488,Damn.
01:32:16.989,01:32:20.576,"You've found my weakness, pride."
01:32:22.161,01:32:25.331,But it's your weak points we're interested in.
01:32:27.917,01:32:30.586,"It's very simple, you will talk."
01:32:32.588,01:32:34.006,And I have to know if it's true.
01:32:35.424,01:32:42.390,We have a few things here strictly for that purpose.
01:32:44.475,01:32:45.309,It's not complicated.
01:32:48.104,01:32:49.814,These are things we learn on the job.
01:32:51.983,01:33:16.173,"At first… I'm not some old man or a wounded prisoner, you motherfucker."
01:33:16.966,01:33:18.759,Don't you dare touch the girl.
01:33:18.843,01:33:20.344,You won't be the first pig I gutted.
01:33:41.824,01:33:42.742,Hey!
01:33:43.909,01:33:45.161,Look! He let her go.
01:33:47.413,01:33:48.706,The fuck did you say?
01:33:52.585,01:33:53.711,Hey!
01:33:56.881,01:33:59.633,Get her! Come on! Bring her to me!
01:34:00.134,01:34:01.969,"Bring her to me, damn it!"
01:34:02.053,01:34:03.346,Mount up!
01:35:06.325,01:35:08.661,It'll be better if you come without struggling.
01:35:09.412,01:35:18.087,"The Captain said that if you behave… Don't be a fool, sweetheart."
01:35:18.170,01:35:23.008,If anyone's going to kill you… I rather it'd be me.
01:36:33.621,01:36:38.626,I've decided to give you one last chance.
01:36:43.881,01:36:45.633,Do you promise to do what I say?
01:36:47.593,01:36:51.889,Will you do everything I tell you without question?
01:36:53.641,01:36:56.477,This is your last chance.
01:36:57.686,01:37:00.606,Listen to me.
01:37:01.357,01:37:10.908,"Fetch your brother and bring him to the labyrinth as quickly as you can, Your Highness."
01:37:11.534,01:37:14.537,-My brother? -We need him.
01:37:14.620,01:37:17.331,-But-- -No more questions.
01:37:20.626,01:37:22.127,The door's locked.
01:37:23.212,01:37:28.008,"In that case, create your own door."
01:40:17.594,01:40:19.054,"Captain, permission to speak."
01:40:22.433,01:40:23.517,Come quickly.
01:40:24.268,01:40:27.563,-Now what? -Serrano is back. He's wounded.
01:40:28.480,01:40:29.690,Wounded?
01:41:16.028,01:41:17.279,Where's Garces?
01:41:25.037,01:41:25.871,How many were there?
01:41:26.538,01:41:28.624,"I don't know exactly, Captain."
01:41:29.291,01:41:30.709,There were at least 50 men.
01:41:30.793,01:41:34.505,The others didn't make it. Our watch posts are not responding.
01:41:34.588,01:41:38.258,"-How many men we have left? -Around 20. Maybe less, sir."
01:41:48.936,01:41:50.312,We're leaving.
01:41:51.438,01:41:52.481,Together.
01:41:53.398,01:41:54.608,Don't be afraid.
01:41:55.484,01:41:56.860,Nothing will happen to you.
01:42:03.617,01:42:05.202,Safeguard the perimeter.
01:42:05.285,01:42:11.333,"If the rest of the squad gets back, report immediately to me."
01:42:11.416,01:42:12.543,"Yes, Captain."
01:42:39.236,01:42:40.070,Leave him!
01:43:26.867,01:43:27.993,Ofelia!
01:44:55.288,01:44:57.749,"Quickly, Your Majesty."
01:44:58.250,01:45:00.585,Give him to me.
01:45:01.169,01:45:04.256,The full moon is high in the sky.
01:45:04.339,01:45:06.883,We can open the portal.
01:45:08.260,01:45:09.678,Why is that in your hand?
01:45:11.263,01:45:16.560,The portal will only open if we offer the blood of an innocent.
01:45:16.643,01:45:20.439,"Just a drop of blood, that's all."
01:45:20.522,01:45:23.650,It's the final task.
01:45:23.734,01:45:24.568,Hurry.
01:45:27.988,01:45:30.991,You promised to obey me!
01:45:31.616,01:45:33.535,-Give me the boy! -No!
01:45:34.536,01:45:36.288,My brother stays with me.
01:45:36.788,01:45:42.753,You would give up your sacred rights for this brat you barely know?
01:45:42.836,01:45:45.338,"Yes, I would."
01:45:46.882,01:45:49.509,You would give up your throne for him?
01:45:49.593,01:45:53.972,"He who has caused you such misery, such humiliation?"
01:45:54.765,01:45:57.350,"Yes, I would."
01:46:01.688,01:46:06.651,"As you wish, Your Highness."
01:46:22.876,01:46:24.002,No!
01:47:22.686,01:47:23.770,My son.
01:47:51.298,01:48:00.473,Tell my son… Tell him what time his father died.
01:48:01.808,01:48:02.934,-Tell him that I-- -No.
01:48:04.269,01:48:05.854,He won't even know your name.
01:49:48.832,01:49:50.625,"Arise, my daughter."
01:49:54.087,01:49:55.046,Come.
01:50:21.698,01:50:22.615,Father.
01:50:23.158,01:50:26.786,You have spilled your own blood rather than that of an innocent.
01:50:27.829,01:50:31.333,That was the final and the most important task.
01:50:42.177,01:50:47.640,"And you chose well, Your Highness."
01:50:47.724,01:50:52.270,"Come here with me, and sit by your father's side."
01:50:52.854,01:50:54.731,He's been waiting for you so long.
01:51:47.951,01:51:51.538,It is said the princess returned to her father's kingdom.
01:51:52.664,01:51:57.794,That she reigned there with justice and a kind heart for many centuries.
01:51:58.878,01:52:00.755,That she was loved by her people.
01:52:01.297,01:52:11.224,"And that she left behind small traces of her time on earth, visible only to those who know where to look."
