00:04:13.959,00:04:20.333,NARRATOR: This is a story of an ordinary little boy named Charlie Bucket.
00:04:20.375,00:04:26.083,He was not faster or stronger or more clever than other children.
00:04:27.917,00:04:32.709,His family was not rich or powerful or well-connected.
00:04:32.750,00:04:36.250,"In fact, they barely had enough to eat."
00:04:36.291,00:04:41.250,Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy in the entire world.
00:04:41.291,00:04:43.875,He just didn't know it yet.
00:05:01.625,00:05:02.709,"Evening, Buckets."
00:05:02.750,00:05:04.500,Evening.
00:05:07.458,00:05:09.458,"Soup's almost ready, darling."
00:05:09.500,00:05:12.166,"Uh, don't suppose there's anything extra to put in?"
00:05:13.959,00:05:15.333,"Oh, well."
00:05:15.375,00:05:17.250,Nothing goes better with cabbage than cabbage.
00:05:20.667,00:05:21.792,Charlie...
00:05:23.166,00:05:25.041,I found something I think you'll like.
00:05:28.750,00:05:33.542,NARRATOR: Charlie's father worked at the local toothpaste factory.
00:05:33.583,00:05:37.709,The hours were long and the pay was terrible.
00:05:37.750,00:05:42.792,"Yet, occasionally, there were unexpected surprises."
00:05:44.709,00:05:46.792,It's exactly what I need.
00:05:47.792,00:05:49.333,"What is it, Charlie?"
00:05:55.166,00:05:58.291,Dad found it-- just the piece I needed.
00:05:58.333,00:05:59.291,What piece was it?
00:05:59.333,00:06:01.166,A head for Willy Wonka.
00:06:01.208,00:06:02.542,How wonderful.
00:06:02.583,00:06:04.583,It's quite a likeness.
00:06:04.625,00:06:05.750,CHARLIE: You think so?
00:06:05.792,00:06:09.083,Think so?
00:06:09.125,00:06:12.500,I saw Willy Wonka with my own two eyes.
00:06:12.542,00:06:14.000,"I used to work for him, you know."
00:06:14.041,00:06:15.375,You did?
00:06:15.417,00:06:16.375,He did.
00:06:16.417,00:06:17.375,He did.
00:06:17.417,00:06:20.041,I love grapes.
00:06:20.083,00:06:24.583,"Of course, I was a much younger man in those days."
00:06:24.625,00:06:30.667,Willy Wonka began with a single store on Cherry Street.
00:06:30.709,00:06:33.125,But the whole world wanted his candy.
00:06:37.125,00:06:38.125,Mr. Wonka.
00:06:38.166,00:06:39.166,Yeah.
00:06:39.208,00:06:43.458,We need more Wonka bars and we're out of chocolate birds.
00:06:43.500,00:06:45.375,Birds?
00:06:45.417,00:06:47.083,Birds.
00:06:47.125,00:06:50.208,"Well, then, we'll need to make some more."
00:06:50.250,00:06:51.625,Here.
00:06:53.875,00:06:55.291,Now open.
00:06:59.709,00:07:02.166,The man was a genius.
00:07:02.208,00:07:11.208,"Did you know he invented a new way of making chocolate ice cream, so that it stays cold for hours without a freezer?"
00:07:11.250,00:07:15.458,You can even leave it lying in the sun on a hot day and it won't go runny.
00:07:15.500,00:07:17.333,That's impossible.
00:07:17.375,00:07:19.583,But Willy Wonka did it.
00:07:22.125,00:07:33.375,"Before long, he decided to build a proper chocolate factory-- the largest chocolate factory in history-- 50 times as big as any other."
00:07:52.917,00:07:55.041,"Grandpa, don't make it gross."
00:07:55.083,00:07:58.208,Tell him about the Indian prince.
00:07:58.250,00:08:00.041,He'd like to hear about that.
00:08:00.083,00:08:02.792,"You mean, Prince Pondicherry."
00:08:02.834,00:08:15.500,"Well, Prince Pondicherry wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka and asked him to come all the way out to India and build him a colossal palace, entirely out of chocolate."
00:08:17.834,00:08:23.542,WONKA: It will have 100 rooms and everything will be made of either dark or light chocolate.
00:08:27.000,00:08:34.333,"GRANDPA JOE: True to his word, the bricks were chocolate and the cement holding them together was chocolate."
00:08:34.375,00:08:38.458,"All the walls and ceilings were made of chocolate, as well."
00:08:38.500,00:08:43.083,So were the carpets and the pictures and the furniture.
00:08:43.125,00:08:45.542,It is perfect in every way.
00:08:45.583,00:08:47.834,"Yeah, but it won't last long."
00:08:47.875,00:08:49.041,You better start eating right now.
00:08:50.083,00:08:51.041,Nonsense.
00:08:51.083,00:08:53.250,I will not eat my palace.
00:08:53.291,00:08:55.959,I intend to live in it.
00:08:59.375,00:09:02.166,"GRANDPA JOE: But Mr. Wonka was right, of course."
00:09:02.208,00:09:08.125,"Soon after this, there came a very hot day with a boiling sun."
00:09:09.291,00:09:10.500,Mmm...
00:09:26.792,00:09:27.834,Oh.
00:09:43.542,00:09:52.000,"GRANDPA JOE: The prince sent an urgent telegram requesting a new palace, but Willy Wonka was facing problems of his own."
00:09:52.041,00:09:58.750,"All the other chocolate makers, you see, had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka."
00:09:58.792,00:10:03.166,They began sending in spies to steal his secret recipes.
00:10:30.625,00:10:35.375,Fickelgruber started making an ice cream that would never melt.
00:10:35.417,00:10:39.959,Prodnose came out with a chewing gum that never lost its flavor.
00:10:40.000,00:10:46.166,Then Slugworth began making candy balloons that you could blow up to incredible sizes.
00:10:46.208,00:10:47.208,Oh!
00:10:47.250,00:10:55.917,"The thievery got so bad that, one day, without a warning, Mr. Wonka told every single one of his workers to go home."
00:10:55.959,00:11:01.667,He announced that he was closing his chocolate factory forever.
00:11:01.709,00:11:05.667,WONKA: I'm closing my chocolate factory forever.
00:11:05.709,00:11:07.333,I'm sorry.
00:11:23.333,00:11:25.542,But it didn't close forever.
00:11:25.583,00:11:27.041,It's open right now.
00:11:27.083,00:11:31.500,"Ah, yes, well, sometimes when grownups say forever, they mean a very long time."
00:11:31.542,00:11:35.375,GRANDPA GEORGE: Such as I feel like I've eaten nothing but cabbage soup forever.
00:11:35.417,00:11:36.583,"Now, Pops."
00:11:36.625,00:11:39.166,"The factory did close, Charlie."
00:11:39.208,00:11:43.333,And it seemed like it was going to be closed forever.
00:11:43.375,00:11:47.834,"Then, one day, we saw smoke rising from the chimneys."
00:11:47.875,00:11:50.667,The factory was back in business.
00:11:50.709,00:11:52.417,Did you get your job back?
00:11:52.458,00:11:54.583,No.
00:11:54.625,00:11:55.834,No one did.
00:11:59.542,00:12:01.959,But there must be people working there.
00:12:02.000,00:12:03.417,"Think about it, Charlie."
00:12:03.458,00:12:07.375,Have you ever seen a single person going into that factory?
00:12:07.417,00:12:08.458,Or coming out of it?
00:12:09.667,00:12:11.000,No.
00:12:11.041,00:12:12.750,The gates are always closed.
00:12:12.792,00:12:14.667,Exactly.
00:12:14.709,00:12:17.500,"But then, who's running the machines?"
00:12:17.542,00:12:18.959,"Nobody knows, Charlie."
00:12:19.000,00:12:20.583,It certainly is a mystery.
00:12:20.625,00:12:22.959,Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka?
00:12:23.000,00:12:26.083,Nobody sees him anymore.
00:12:26.125,00:12:27.625,He never comes out.
00:12:27.667,00:12:34.750,"The only thing that comes out of that place is the candy, already packed and addressed."
00:12:34.792,00:12:45.250,I'd give anything in the world just to go in one more time and see what's become of that amazing factory.
00:12:45.291,00:12:46.875,"Well, you won't."
00:12:46.917,00:12:48.375,Because you can't.
00:12:48.417,00:12:49.959,No one can.
00:12:50.000,00:12:54.083,It's a mystery and it will always be a mystery.
00:12:54.125,00:12:58.875,"That little factory of yours, Charlie, is as close as any of us is ever going to get."
00:12:58.917,00:13:01.208,"Come on, Charlie."
00:13:01.250,00:13:03.667,I think it's time we let your grandparents get some sleep.
00:13:06.333,00:13:07.542,"Good night, Grandpa George."
00:13:07.583,00:13:10.041,"Night, Charlie."
00:13:10.083,00:13:11.083,"Good night, now."
00:13:11.125,00:13:12.083,Chair.
00:13:12.125,00:13:13.166,"Thank you, dear."
00:13:15.458,00:13:16.667,"Night, Grandpa Joe."
00:13:18.709,00:13:20.333,"Good night, Grandma Georgina."
00:13:20.375,00:13:24.417,"Nothing's impossible, Charlie."
00:13:41.083,00:13:42.166,Good night.
00:13:42.208,00:13:44.750,"ALL: Night, Charlie."
00:13:55.291,00:14:01.208,"NARRATOR: Indeed, that very night, the impossible had already been set in motion."
00:15:01.917,00:15:11.250,"WONKA: Dear people of the world, I, Willy Wonka, have decided to allow five children to visit my factory this year."
00:15:11.291,00:15:18.291,"In addition, one of these children shall receive a special prize beyond anything you could ever imagine."
00:15:18.333,00:15:24.875,MAN: Five golden tickets have been hidden underneath the ordinary wrapping paper of five ordinary Wonka bars.
00:15:24.917,00:15:32.375,"These five candy bars may be anywhere, in any shop, in any street, in any town in any country in the world."
00:16:06.458,00:16:13.583,"GRANDPA JOE: Wouldn't it be something, Charlie, to open a bar of candy and find a golden ticket inside?"
00:16:13.625,00:16:14.792,I know.
00:16:14.834,00:16:17.875,But I only get one bar a year-- for my birthday.
00:16:17.917,00:16:20.417,"Well, it's your birthday next week."
00:16:20.458,00:16:23.792,You have as much chance as anybody does.
00:16:23.834,00:16:25.208,Balderdash.
00:16:25.250,00:16:29.375,The kids who are going to find the golden tickets are the ones who can afford to buy candy bars every day.
00:16:29.417,00:16:32.250,Our Charlie gets only one a year.
00:16:32.291,00:16:33.375,He doesn't have a chance.
00:16:33.417,00:16:37.083,"GRANDMA JOSEPHINE: Everyone has a chance, Charlie."
00:16:37.125,00:16:38.750,Mark my words.
00:16:38.792,00:16:43.875,"The kid who finds the first ticket will be fat, fat, fat."
00:16:45.000,00:16:46.041,This way.
00:16:51.917,00:16:56.458,I eating the Wonka bar and I taste something that is not chocolate.
00:16:56.500,00:16:59.625,Or coconut...
00:16:59.667,00:17:09.000,"or walnut, or peanut butter, or nougat, or butter brittle or caramel, or sprinkles."
00:17:09.041,00:17:12.750,So I look and...
00:17:14.000,00:17:15.709,I find ze golden ticket.
00:17:15.750,00:17:18.000,"Augustus, how did you celebrate?"
00:17:18.041,00:17:21.083,I eat more candy.
00:17:24.041,00:17:27.166,We knew Augustus would find the golden ticket.
00:17:27.208,00:17:33.709,He eats so many candy bars a day that it was not possible for him not to find one.
00:17:37.208,00:17:39.709,NEWSCASTER: ...ticket claimed and only four more...
00:17:39.750,00:17:41.291,Told you it'd be a porker.
00:17:41.333,00:17:43.792,What a repulsive boy.
00:17:43.834,00:17:45.625,Only four golden tickets left.
00:17:45.667,00:17:50.500,"Now that they found one, things will really get crazy."
00:17:50.542,00:17:52.709,"NEWSCASTER: ...of every shape, size and hue."
00:17:55.792,00:17:56.834,REPORTER: Veruca?
00:17:56.875,00:17:58.000,Can you spell that for us please?
00:17:58.041,00:18:01.291,GIRL: V-E-R-U-C-A.
00:18:01.333,00:18:03.000,Veruca Salt.
00:18:04.417,00:18:11.667,"As soon as my little Veruca told me she had to have one of these golden tickets, I started buying up all the Wonka bars I could lay my hands on."
00:18:11.709,00:18:13.041,Thousands of them.
00:18:13.083,00:18:14.667,Hundreds of thousands.
00:18:14.709,00:18:16.875,"I'm in the nut business, you see."
00:18:16.917,00:18:18.709,So I say to my workers...
00:18:18.750,00:18:20.291,"Morning, ladies."
00:18:20.333,00:18:26.166,"From now on, you can stop shelling peanuts and start shelling the wrappers off these chocolate bars instead."
00:18:39.709,00:18:42.333,MR. SALT: Three days went by and we had no luck.
00:18:42.375,00:18:43.959,It was terrible.
00:18:44.000,00:18:46.417,My little Veruca got more and more upset each day.
00:18:46.458,00:18:47.917,Where's my golden ticket?
00:18:47.959,00:18:50.542,I want my golden ticket.
00:18:52.750,00:18:55.500,"Well, gentlemen, I just hated to see my little girl feeling unhappy like that."
00:18:55.542,00:18:59.333,I vowed I would keep up the search until I could give her what she wanted.
00:18:59.375,00:19:01.583,Then finally...
00:19:01.625,00:19:04.250,I found her a ticket.
00:19:30.500,00:19:33.959,"Daddy, I want another pony."
00:19:35.834,00:19:37.875,She's even worse than the fat boy.
00:19:37.917,00:19:39.750,I didn't think that was really fair.
00:19:39.792,00:19:42.000,She didn't find the ticket herself.
00:19:42.041,00:19:44.291,"Don't worry about it, Charlie."
00:19:44.333,00:19:51.041,"That man spoils his daughter, and no good ever comes from spoiling a child like that."
00:19:54.709,00:20:02.500,"Charlie, Mum and I thought maybe you want to open your birthday present tonight."
00:20:08.041,00:20:09.834,Here you are.
00:20:22.625,00:20:24.375,Maybe I should wait till morning.
00:20:24.417,00:20:25.417,Like hell.
00:20:25.458,00:20:26.667,Pop.
00:20:26.709,00:20:29.750,"All together, we're 381 years old."
00:20:29.792,00:20:31.333,We don't wait.
00:20:40.208,00:20:42.417,"Now, Charlie, you mustn't feel too disappointed."
00:20:42.458,00:20:45.125,"You know, if you don't get the..."
00:20:45.166,00:20:47.542,"Whatever happens, you'll still have the candy."
00:21:16.959,00:21:18.041,"Ah, well."
00:21:18.083,00:21:20.208,That's that.
00:21:22.625,00:21:23.917,We'll share it.
00:21:23.959,00:21:25.125,"Oh, no, Charlie."
00:21:25.166,00:21:27.333,Not your birthday present.
00:21:27.375,00:21:31.542,"It's my candy bar, and I'll do what I want with it."
00:21:37.166,00:21:38.959,"Thank you, darling."
00:21:40.000,00:21:41.375,"Thank you, Charlie."
00:21:45.333,00:21:47.250,Thank you.
00:22:13.542,00:22:15.542,"All right, let's see who found it."
00:22:20.291,00:22:24.041,The third ticket was found by Miss Violet Beauregarde.
00:22:24.083,00:22:25.083,Hah! Hah!
00:22:25.125,00:22:26.083,Hah!
00:22:26.125,00:22:27.083,Hah!
00:22:27.125,00:22:28.792,Hah! Huh!
00:22:28.834,00:22:29.917,Hai! Huh!
00:22:29.959,00:22:30.959,Hah!
00:22:31.000,00:22:32.041,Huh!
00:22:42.458,00:22:48.417,These are just some of the 263 trophies and medals my Violet has won.
00:22:48.458,00:22:54.333,"I'm a gum chewer, mostly, but when I heard about these ticket things, I laid off the gum, switched to candy bars."
00:22:54.375,00:22:56.125,She's just a driven young woman.
00:22:56.166,00:22:57.834,I don't know where she gets it.
00:22:59.166,00:23:02.083,I'm the Junior World Champion Gum Chewer.
00:23:02.125,00:23:07.333,"This piece of gum I'm chewing right at this moment, I've been working on for three months solid."
00:23:07.375,00:23:08.792,That's a record.
00:23:08.834,00:23:11.041,"Of course, I did have my share of trophies."
00:23:11.083,00:23:13.500,Mostly baton.
00:23:13.542,00:23:17.959,"So it says that one kid's going to get this special prize, better than all the rest."
00:23:18.041,00:23:20.250,I don't care who those other four are.
00:23:20.291,00:23:22.333,That kid-- it's gonna be me.
00:23:22.375,00:23:23.792,"Tell them why, Violet."
00:23:23.834,00:23:25.875,Because I'm a winner.
00:23:25.917,00:23:28.000,What a beastly girl.
00:23:28.041,00:23:29.417,Despicable.
00:23:29.458,00:23:32.166,You don't know what we're talking about.
00:23:34.417,00:23:35.750,Dragonflies?
00:23:35.792,00:23:38.041,"TV REPORTER: But wait, this is just in."
00:23:38.083,00:23:44.000,The fourth golden ticket has been found by a boy called Mike Teavee.
00:23:55.333,00:24:02.333,"All you had to do was track the manufacturing dates, offset by weather and the derivative of the Nikkei Index."
00:24:02.375,00:24:04.625,A retard could figure it out.
00:24:04.667,00:24:07.917,"Most of the time, I don't know what he's talking about."
00:24:07.959,00:24:11.417,"You know, kids these days, what with all the technology."
00:24:11.458,00:24:13.959,Die! Die! Die!
00:24:15.458,00:24:18.083,Doesn't seem like they stay kids very long.
00:24:22.583,00:24:25.458,"In the end, I only had to buy one candy bar."
00:24:25.500,00:24:26.917,And how did it taste?
00:24:26.959,00:24:28.417,I don't know.
00:24:28.458,00:24:30.125,I hate chocolate.
00:24:30.166,00:24:34.208,"Well, it's a good thing you're going to a chocolate factory, you ungrateful little..."
00:24:43.625,00:24:48.041,TV REPORTER: ...that question is: Who will be the winner of the last golden...?
00:24:52.834,00:24:54.875,Dad?
00:24:54.917,00:24:56.000,"Yes, Charlie?"
00:24:56.041,00:24:57.709,Why aren't you at work?
00:24:58.792,00:25:03.333,"Uh, well, uh... toothpaste factory thought they'd give me a bit of time off."
00:25:03.375,00:25:05.458,Like summer vacation?
00:25:05.500,00:25:06.750,Sure.
00:25:06.792,00:25:08.500,Something like that.
00:25:11.333,00:25:15.709,"NARRATOR: In fact, it wasn't like a vacation at all."
00:25:15.750,00:25:24.333,"The upswing in candy sales had led to a rise in cavities, which led to a rise in toothpaste sales."
00:25:29.000,00:25:36.625,"With the extra money, the factory had decided to modernize, eliminating Mr. Bucket's job."
00:25:41.750,00:25:44.083,We were barely making ends meet as it was.
00:25:44.125,00:25:46.333,"Oh, you'll find another job."
00:25:46.375,00:25:48.250,"Until then, I'll just, um..."
00:25:48.291,00:25:51.417,"well, I'll just thin down the soup a little more."
00:25:51.458,00:25:54.083,"Don't worry, Mr. Bucket."
00:25:54.125,00:25:55.458,Our luck will change.
00:25:55.500,00:25:56.709,Mmm.
00:25:56.750,00:25:59.667,I know it.
00:26:01.458,00:26:03.917,Charlie.
00:26:19.291,00:26:22.458,My secret hoard.
00:26:24.542,00:26:31.875,You and I are going to have one more fling at finding that last ticket.
00:26:31.917,00:26:34.917,"Are you sure you want to spend your money on that, Grandpa?"
00:26:34.959,00:26:36.375,Of course I'm sure.
00:26:36.417,00:26:37.792,Here.
00:26:37.834,00:26:44.166,Run down to the nearest store and buy the first Wonka candy bar you see.
00:26:44.208,00:26:49.250,"Bring it straight back, and we'll open it together."
00:26:57.542,00:27:01.000,"Such a good boy, really."
00:27:01.041,00:27:02.750,"Oh, such a..."
00:27:03.834,00:27:06.083,CHARLIE: Grandpa?
00:27:07.417,00:27:09.083,You fell asleep.
00:27:09.125,00:27:10.291,Have you got it?
00:27:14.000,00:27:17.750,Which end should we open first?
00:27:17.792,00:27:19.959,"Just do it quick, like a Band-Aid."
00:27:50.500,00:27:54.083,Did you see that some kid in Russia found the last golden ticket?
00:27:54.125,00:27:56.333,"Yes, it was in the paper this morning."
00:27:56.375,00:27:57.750,Good boy.
00:27:57.792,00:28:00.083,"Come on, George."
00:28:51.375,00:28:54.625,"One Wonka Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight, please."
00:28:54.667,00:28:55.875,Okay.
00:28:55.917,00:28:57.667,Yep.
00:29:03.166,00:29:04.208,The nerve of some people.
00:29:04.250,00:29:06.500,I know.
00:29:06.542,00:29:09.083,Forging a ticket.
00:29:21.500,00:29:22.875,It's a golden ticket.
00:29:25.625,00:29:28.375,You found Wonka's last golden ticket!
00:29:29.417,00:29:31.333,"In my shop, too!"
00:29:32.417,00:29:34.083,"Listen, I'll buy it from you."
00:29:34.125,00:29:35.458,I'll give you $50.
00:29:35.500,00:29:36.542,And a new bicycle.
00:29:36.583,00:29:38.125,Are you crazy?
00:29:38.166,00:29:39.208,I'd give him $500 for that ticket.
00:29:39.250,00:29:42.583,"You want to sell me your ticket for $500, young man?"
00:29:42.625,00:29:44.000,That's enough of that!
00:29:45.417,00:29:47.959,"Listen, don't let anyone have it."
00:29:48.000,00:29:50.834,"Take it straight home, you understand?"
00:29:50.875,00:29:52.959,Thank you.
00:29:59.375,00:30:02.792,Mom! Dad!
00:30:02.834,00:30:05.125,I found it!
00:30:05.166,00:30:08.750,The last golden ticket-- it's mine!
00:30:22.542,00:30:24.375,Yippee!
00:30:30.583,00:30:31.667,Here.
00:30:32.875,00:30:34.041,Read this aloud.
00:30:34.083,00:30:36.500,Let's hear exactly what it says.
00:30:36.542,00:30:42.333,Greetings to you the lucky finder of this golden ticket from Mr. Willy Wonka.
00:30:42.375,00:30:44.041,I shake you warmly by the hand.
00:30:44.083,00:30:49.500,For now I do invite you to come to my factory and be my guest for one whole day.
00:30:49.542,00:30:55.959,"VIOLET: I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you around the factory myself, showing you everything there is to see."
00:30:56.000,00:31:04.750,"Afterwards, when it is time to leave, you will be escorted home by a procession of large trucks, each one filled with all the chocolate you could ever eat."
00:31:04.792,00:31:12.166,"VERUCA: And remember, one of you lucky five children will receive an extra prize beyond your wildest imagination."
00:31:12.208,00:31:18.625,"Now, here are your instructions: On the first of February, you must come to the factory gates at 10:00 a.m. sharp."
00:31:18.667,00:31:22.125,You're allowed to bring one member of your family to look after you.
00:31:22.166,00:31:24.959,"Till then, Willy Wonka."
00:31:25.000,00:31:27.000,MRS. BUCKET: First of February.
00:31:27.041,00:31:28.959,But that's tomorrow.
00:31:29.000,00:31:31.000,"Then there's not a moment to lose, Charlie."
00:31:31.041,00:31:34.917,"Wash your face, comb your hair, scrub your hands, brush your teeth, blow your nose..."
00:31:34.959,00:31:36.500,And get that mud off your pants.
00:31:36.542,00:31:38.041,MRS. BUCKET: Now we must all try and keep very calm.
00:31:38.083,00:31:43.500,First thing that we have to decide is this: Who is going with Charlie to the factory?
00:31:43.542,00:31:44.500,I will.
00:31:44.542,00:31:45.542,I'll take him.
00:31:45.583,00:31:46.792,You leave it to me.
00:31:46.834,00:31:47.959,"How about you, dear?"
00:31:48.000,00:31:49.083,Don't you think you ought to go?
00:31:49.125,00:31:54.709,Well... Grandpa Joe seems to know more about it than we do.
00:31:54.750,00:31:57.542,"Provided, of course, he feels well enough."
00:31:57.583,00:31:58.959,Yippee!
00:32:00.458,00:32:01.667,No.
00:32:01.709,00:32:03.625,We're not going.
00:32:06.250,00:32:09.041,A woman offered me $500 for the ticket.
00:32:09.083,00:32:11.375,I bet someone else would pay more.
00:32:11.417,00:32:15.000,We need the money more than we need the chocolate.
00:32:24.291,00:32:27.417,"Young man, come here."
00:32:30.583,00:32:33.750,There's plenty of money out there.
00:32:33.792,00:32:36.166,They print more every day.
00:32:36.208,00:32:45.834,"But this ticket-- there's only five of them in the whole world, and that's all there's ever going to be."
00:32:45.875,00:32:51.625,Only a dummy would give this up for something as common as money.
00:32:51.667,00:32:54.458,Are you a dummy?
00:32:54.500,00:32:56.625,"No, sir."
00:32:56.667,00:32:59.041,Then get that mud off your pants.
00:32:59.083,00:33:01.291,You've got a factory to go to.
00:33:44.667,00:33:47.333,"Daddy, I want to go in."
00:33:47.375,00:33:49.458,"It's 9:59, sweetheart."
00:33:49.500,00:33:51.917,Make time go faster.
00:33:51.959,00:33:54.041,Do you think Mr. Wonka will recognize you?
00:33:54.083,00:33:55.458,Hard to say.
00:33:55.500,00:33:57.291,It's been years.
00:34:05.458,00:34:06.917,"Eyes on the prize, Violet."
00:34:06.959,00:34:09.041,Eyes on the prize.
00:34:26.959,00:34:30.417,Please enter.
00:34:41.125,00:34:44.834,Come... forward.
00:34:47.834,00:34:50.375,Close the gates.
00:34:59.834,00:35:05.875,"Dear visitors, it is my great pleasure to welcome you to my humble factory."
00:35:08.250,00:35:10.500,And who am I?
00:35:12.458,00:35:14.667,Well...
00:36:30.500,00:36:32.125,Wasn't that just magnificent?
00:36:32.166,00:36:37.834,"I was worried it was getting a little dodgy in the middle part, but then that finale-- wow!"
00:36:41.166,00:36:42.250,Who are you?
00:36:43.959,00:36:45.959,He's Willy Wonka.
00:36:46.000,00:36:47.041,Really?
00:36:56.417,00:36:59.208,"Good morning, Starshine."
00:36:59.250,00:37:01.709,The Earth says hello.
00:37:09.709,00:37:12.875,"Dear guests, greetings."
00:37:12.917,00:37:14.375,Welcome to the factory.
00:37:14.417,00:37:16.917,I shake you warmly by the hand.
00:37:20.375,00:37:22.500,My name is Willy Wonka.
00:37:23.709,00:37:25.375,Then shouldn't you be up there?
00:37:25.417,00:37:29.750,"Well, I couldn't very well watch the show from up there, now, could I, little girl?"
00:37:29.792,00:37:36.834,"Mr. Wonka, I don't know if you remember me, but I used to work here in the factory."
00:37:36.875,00:37:44.333,Were you one of those despicable spies who every day tried to steal my life's work and sell it to those parasitic copycat candy-making cads?
00:37:44.375,00:37:45.750,"No, sir."
00:37:45.792,00:37:47.959,Then wonderful.
00:37:48.000,00:37:49.667,"Let's get a move on, kids."
00:37:51.959,00:37:54.792,Don't you want to know our names?
00:37:54.834,00:37:56.625,Can't imagine how it would matter.
00:37:57.959,00:38:00.000,Come quickly.
00:38:04.333,00:38:07.500,Just drop your coats anywhere.
00:38:13.291,00:38:16.542,"Mr. Wonka, sure is toasty in here."
00:38:16.583,00:38:18.083,"What?! Oh, yeah."
00:38:18.125,00:38:22.333,I have to keep it warm in here because my workers are used to an extremely hot climate.
00:38:22.375,00:38:24.333,They just can't stand the cold.
00:38:24.375,00:38:25.417,Who are the workers?
00:38:26.458,00:38:27.500,WONKA: All in good time.
00:38:27.542,00:38:28.583,Now...
00:38:32.917,00:38:34.792,"Mr. Wonka, I'm Violet Beauregarde."
00:38:34.834,00:38:36.542,Oh.
00:38:37.625,00:38:38.959,I don't care.
00:38:39.000,00:38:42.500,"Well, you should care, because I'm the girl who's going to win the special prize at the end."
00:38:42.542,00:38:44.792,"Well, you do seem confident, and confidence is key."
00:38:48.041,00:38:49.000,I'm Veruca Salt.
00:38:50.083,00:38:51.792,"It's very nice to meet you, sir."
00:38:51.834,00:38:55.667,I always thought a veruca was a type of wart you got on the bottom of your foot.
00:38:58.291,00:39:00.125,I'm Augustus Gloop.
00:39:00.166,00:39:01.709,I love your chocolate.
00:39:02.667,00:39:03.959,I can see that.
00:39:04.000,00:39:05.417,So do I.
00:39:05.458,00:39:08.875,I never expected to have so much in common.
00:39:12.667,00:39:13.875,You.
00:39:13.917,00:39:15.750,You're Mike Teavee.
00:39:15.792,00:39:18.375,You're the little devil who cracked the system.
00:39:19.917,00:39:21.458,And you.
00:39:21.500,00:39:23.583,"Well, you're just lucky to be here, aren't you?"
00:39:25.250,00:39:28.750,And the rest of you must be their p...
00:39:35.667,00:39:36.625,Parents.
00:39:36.667,00:39:38.083,Yeah.
00:39:38.125,00:39:41.500,Moms and dads.
00:39:41.542,00:39:44.041,Dad?
00:39:45.041,00:39:47.417,Papa?
00:39:53.625,00:39:56.583,"Okay, then. Let's move along."
00:40:06.500,00:40:07.500,Would you like some chocolate?
00:40:07.542,00:40:08.667,Sure.
00:40:08.709,00:40:10.542,Then you should've brought some.
00:40:13.917,00:40:15.542,Let's be friends.
00:40:15.583,00:40:16.667,Best friends.
00:40:28.417,00:40:30.500,"An important room, this."
00:40:30.542,00:40:32.500,"After all, it is a chocolate factory."
00:40:32.542,00:40:34.667,Then why is the door so small?
00:40:34.709,00:40:37.875,That's to keep all the great big chocolaty flavor inside.
00:41:00.125,00:41:04.250,"Now... do be careful, my dear children."
00:41:04.291,00:41:05.583,Don't lose your heads.
00:41:05.625,00:41:08.125,Don't get overexcited.
00:41:08.166,00:41:11.542,Just keep very calm.
00:41:27.709,00:41:29.291,It's beautiful.
00:41:29.333,00:41:31.667,What?
00:41:31.709,00:41:34.500,"Ooh, yeah, it's very beautiful."
00:41:43.417,00:41:50.291,Every drop of the river is hot melted chocolate of the finest quality.
00:41:54.500,00:41:57.667,The waterfall is most important.
00:41:57.709,00:42:02.875,"It mixes the chocolate, churns it up, makes it light and frothy."
00:42:02.917,00:42:10.250,"By the way, no other factory in the world mixes its chocolate by waterfall, my dear children."
00:42:10.291,00:42:12.500,And you can take that to the bank.
00:42:22.792,00:42:25.083,People!
00:42:26.125,00:42:28.500,Those pipes...
00:42:28.542,00:42:33.709,suck up the chocolate and carry it away all over the factory.
00:42:33.750,00:42:36.125,Thousands of gallons an hour.
00:42:36.166,00:42:37.166,Yeah.
00:42:37.208,00:42:39.250,And do you like my meadow?
00:42:39.291,00:42:41.417,Try some of my grass.
00:42:41.458,00:42:42.875,Please have a blade. Please do.
00:42:42.917,00:42:46.125,It's so delectable and so darn good-looking.
00:42:46.166,00:42:48.250,You can eat the grass?
00:42:48.291,00:42:50.125,Of course you can.
00:42:50.166,00:42:52.917,Everything in this room is eatable.
00:42:52.959,00:43:00.500,"Even I'm eatable, but that is called cannibalism, my dear children, and is, in fact, frowned upon in most societies."
00:43:00.542,00:43:02.083,Yeah.
00:43:02.125,00:43:03.959,Enjoy.
00:43:04.000,00:43:05.834,Go on.
00:43:05.875,00:43:07.500,"Scoot, scoot."
00:43:20.125,00:43:21.667,Hmm.
00:43:28.500,00:43:29.667,Son...
00:43:31.000,00:43:32.875,Please...
00:43:32.917,00:43:37.125,"Dad, he said enjoy."
00:43:50.458,00:43:53.583,Why hold onto it?
00:43:53.625,00:43:55.750,Because then I wouldn't be a champion.
00:43:55.792,00:43:58.834,I'd be a loser like you.
00:44:27.041,00:44:29.375,"Daddy, look over there."
00:44:30.417,00:44:32.917,What is it?
00:44:32.959,00:44:34.625,It's a little person.
00:44:34.667,00:44:37.333,"Over there, by the waterfall."
00:44:39.291,00:44:40.375,There's two of them.
00:44:40.417,00:44:42.166,There's more than two.
00:44:47.834,00:44:49.959,MRS. GLOOP: Where do they come from?
00:44:50.000,00:44:51.041,Who are they?
00:44:52.709,00:44:53.917,Are they real people?
00:44:53.959,00:44:55.959,Of course they're real people.
00:44:56.000,00:44:57.208,They're Oompa-Loompas.
00:45:00.667,00:45:01.709,Oompa-Loompas?
00:45:01.750,00:45:03.750,Imported direct from Loompaland.
00:45:03.792,00:45:05.166,There's no such place.
00:45:05.208,00:45:06.417,What?
00:45:06.458,00:45:10.625,"Mr. Wonka, I teach high school geography, and I'm here to tell you..."
00:45:10.667,00:45:16.083,"Well, then you'll know all about it, and know what a terrible country it is."
00:45:26.166,00:45:38.083,"WONKA: The whole place is nothing but thick jungles infested by the most dangerous beasts in the entire world: Hornswagglers and snozwangers and those terrible, wicked wangdoodles."
00:45:58.291,00:46:04.166,I went to Loompaland looking for exotic new flavors for candy.
00:46:06.291,00:46:10.458,"Instead, I found the Oompa-Loompas."
00:46:18.333,00:46:23.750,They lived in tree houses to escape from the fierce creatures who lived below.
00:46:26.875,00:46:31.625,The Oompa-Loompas ate nothing but green caterpillars which tasted revolting.
00:46:32.959,00:46:46.333,"The Oompa-Loompas kept looking for other things to mash up with the caterpillars to make them taste better: red beetles, the bark of the bong-bong tree-- all of them beastly, but not quite so beastly as the caterpillars."
00:46:52.583,00:46:53.959,Mm.
00:47:17.834,00:47:21.750,But the food they longed for the most was the cocoa bean.
00:47:26.041,00:47:29.792,An Oompa-Loompa was lucky if he found three or four cocoa beans a year.
00:47:29.834,00:47:33.375,"But oh, how they craved them."
00:47:33.417,00:47:37.000,All they'd ever think about was cocoa beans.
00:47:42.291,00:47:46.750,"The cocoa bean happens to be the thing from which chocolate is made, so I told the chief..."
00:48:06.875,00:48:09.875,They are such wonderful workers.
00:48:09.917,00:48:13.208,"I feel I must warn you, though, they are rather mischievous."
00:48:13.250,00:48:15.333,Always making jokes.
00:48:15.375,00:48:19.166,"Augustus, mein child, that is not a good thing you do."
00:48:21.542,00:48:26.291,"Hey, little boy, my chocolate must be untouched by human hands."
00:48:33.166,00:48:34.208,He'll drown!
00:48:35.333,00:48:37.834,He can't swim!
00:48:37.875,00:48:39.500,Save him!
00:48:40.583,00:48:42.083,"Augustus, no!"
00:48:49.083,00:48:51.834,Augustus!
00:48:59.959,00:49:03.834,"Augustus, get out!"
00:49:20.166,00:49:21.291,There he goes.
00:49:23.333,00:49:25.166,Call the fire brigade!
00:49:25.208,00:49:27.000,It's a wonder how that pipe is big enough.
00:49:28.125,00:49:29.542,CHARLIE: It isn't big enough.
00:49:29.583,00:49:30.667,He's slowing down.
00:49:30.709,00:49:32.166,He's going to stick.
00:49:33.291,00:49:34.959,I think he has.
00:49:38.458,00:49:40.083,He's backed the whole pipe.
00:49:42.583,00:49:45.083,Look. The Oompa-Loompas.
00:49:49.000,00:49:50.250,What are they doing?
00:49:53.041,00:49:55.250,"Why, I believe they're going to treat us to a little song."
00:49:55.291,00:49:57.250,"It is quite a special occasion, of course."
00:49:57.291,00:49:59.583,They haven't had a fresh audience in many a moon.
00:51:48.875,00:51:50.375,No!
00:52:03.250,00:52:05.917,Bravo! Well done!
00:52:05.959,00:52:08.542,Aren't they delightful?
00:52:08.583,00:52:10.792,I do say that all seemed rather rehearsed.
00:52:10.834,00:52:13.125,Like they knew what was going to happen.
00:52:13.166,00:52:15.583,"Oh, poppycock."
00:52:18.375,00:52:20.000,Where is my son?
00:52:20.041,00:52:21.458,Where does that pipe go to?
00:52:23.083,00:52:30.542,That pipe-- it just so happens to lead directly to the room where I make the most delicious kind of strawberry-flavored chocolate-coated fudge.
00:52:30.583,00:52:34.250,Then he will be made into strawberry-flavored chocolate-coated fudge?
00:52:34.291,00:52:36.917,They'll be selling him by the pound all over the world?
00:52:37.959,00:52:39.709,No. I wouldn't allow it.
00:52:39.750,00:52:40.959,The taste would be terrible.
00:52:41.000,00:52:44.417,Can you imagine Augustus-flavored chocolate-coated Gloop?
00:52:44.458,00:52:46.709,Ew! No one would buy it.
00:52:54.917,00:52:58.917,"I want you to take Mrs. Gloop up to the fudge room, okay?"
00:52:58.959,00:53:00.667,Help her find her son.
00:53:00.709,00:53:06.291,"And take a long stick and start poking around in the big chocolate mixing barrel, okay?"
00:53:22.917,00:53:24.000,Mr. Wonka?
00:53:24.041,00:53:25.250,Huh?
00:53:25.291,00:53:29.125,Why would Augustus' name already be in the Oompa-Loompa song unless they...?
00:53:29.166,00:53:30.917,Improvisation is a parlor trick.
00:53:30.959,00:53:32.291,Anyone can do it.
00:53:32.333,00:53:34.625,"You, little girl, say something."
00:53:34.667,00:53:35.667,Anything.
00:53:35.709,00:53:37.125,Chewing gum.
00:53:37.166,00:53:40.458,Chewing gum is really gross; chewing gum I hate the most.
00:53:40.500,00:53:41.542,See? Exactly the same.
00:53:42.375,00:53:43.500,"No, it isn't."
00:53:43.542,00:53:49.000,"Uh, you really shouldn't mumble, because I can't understand a word you're saying."
00:53:50.375,00:53:54.375,Now... on with the tour.
00:53:56.375,00:53:58.709,"Are the Oompa-Loompas really joking, Grandpa?"
00:53:58.750,00:54:00.625,Of course they're joking.
00:54:00.667,00:54:03.875,That boy will be fine.
00:54:51.959,00:54:53.542,What's so funny?
00:54:53.583,00:54:56.750,I think it's from all those doggone cocoa beans.
00:54:56.792,00:55:03.458,"Hey, by the way, did you guys know that chocolate contains a property that triggers the release of endorphins?"
00:55:03.500,00:55:06.041,Gives one the feeling of being in love.
00:55:06.083,00:55:08.000,You don't say.
00:55:09.625,00:55:13.291,All aboard.
00:55:22.542,00:55:24.542,Onward.
00:55:46.625,00:55:48.709,WONKA: Here...
00:55:50.000,00:55:51.709,Try some of this.
00:55:51.750,00:55:54.291,You look starved to death.
00:55:55.583,00:55:57.000,It's great!
00:55:57.041,00:56:00.041,That's because it's mixed by waterfall.
00:56:00.083,00:56:02.458,The waterfall is most important.
00:56:02.500,00:56:06.792,"It mixes the chocolate, churns it up, makes it light and frothy."
00:56:06.834,00:56:10.333,"Uh, by the way, no other factory in the world m..."
00:56:10.375,00:56:11.458,You already said that.
00:56:16.166,00:56:18.750,"You're all quite short, aren't you?"
00:56:18.792,00:56:20.542,"Well, yeah."
00:56:20.583,00:56:23.417,"Well, that's no excuse."
00:56:23.458,00:56:24.667,You were once.
00:56:24.709,00:56:26.792,Was not! Know why?
00:56:26.834,00:56:30.750,Because I distinctly remember putting a hat on top of my head.
00:56:30.792,00:56:32.500,Look at your short little arms.
00:56:32.542,00:56:34.792,You could never reach.
00:56:37.083,00:56:39.625,Do you even remember what it was like being a kid?
00:56:39.667,00:56:42.291,"Oh, boy, do I."
00:56:45.041,00:56:46.291,Do I?
00:56:46.333,00:56:51.458,"NARRATOR: In fact, Willy Wonka hadn't thought about his childhood for years."
00:56:51.500,00:56:53.625,KIDS: Trick or treat!
00:57:04.208,00:57:05.959,ALL: Trick or treat!
00:57:07.959,00:57:09.250,Who do we have here?
00:57:09.291,00:57:15.000,"Ruthie, Veronica, Terrence... and who's that under the sheet?"
00:57:16.625,00:57:19.250,Little Willy Wonka.
00:57:19.291,00:57:20.333,Oh...
00:57:22.917,00:57:30.667,NARRATOR: Willy Wonka was the son of the city's most famous dentist-- Wilbur Wonka.
00:57:36.375,00:57:41.250,"Now, let's see what the damage is this year, shall we?"
00:57:54.792,00:57:57.208,Caramels.
00:57:57.250,00:57:59.542,"They'd get stuck in your braces, wouldn't they?"
00:58:05.333,00:58:07.333,Lollipops.
00:58:07.375,00:58:10.667,What we call cavities on a stick.
00:58:11.709,00:58:15.792,Then we have all this... all this...
00:58:15.834,00:58:18.250,chocolate.
00:58:19.375,00:58:28.417,"You know, just last week, I was reading, in a very important medical journal, that some children are allergic to chocolate."
00:58:28.458,00:58:31.583,Makes their noses itch.
00:58:31.625,00:58:34.250,Maybe I'm not allergic.
00:58:34.291,00:58:35.959,I could try a piece.
00:58:36.000,00:58:37.667,Really?
00:58:37.709,00:58:39.709,But why take a chance?
00:58:55.375,00:58:56.709,CHARLIE: Mr. Wonka?
00:58:56.750,00:58:59.709,"Mr. Wonka, we're headed for a tunnel!"
00:58:59.750,00:59:00.917,"Oh, yeah."
00:59:00.959,00:59:02.667,"Uh, full speed ahead."
00:59:09.166,00:59:11.125,How can they see where they're going?
00:59:11.166,00:59:12.542,They can't.
00:59:12.583,00:59:14.625,There's no knowing where they're going.
00:59:14.667,00:59:16.291,Switch on the lights.
00:59:43.208,00:59:45.417,"People, keep an eye out."
00:59:45.458,00:59:48.583,We're passing some very important rooms here.
00:59:53.208,00:59:54.959,What do you use hair cream for?
00:59:55.000,00:59:56.333,To lock in moisture.
01:00:04.458,01:00:05.792,Whipped cream.
01:00:08.125,01:00:09.333,That doesn't make sense.
01:00:09.375,01:00:15.792,"For your information, little girl, whipped cream isn't whipped cream at all unless it's been whipped with whips."
01:00:15.834,01:00:18.500,Everybody knows that.
01:01:07.792,01:01:09.083,Stop the boat.
01:01:09.125,01:01:11.041,I want to show you guys something.
01:01:31.083,01:01:34.917,"Now, this is the most important room in the entire factory."
01:01:34.959,01:01:39.000,"Now, everyone enjoy yourselves, but just don't touch anything."
01:01:39.041,01:01:40.041,Okay?
01:01:40.083,01:01:41.041,Go on!
01:01:41.083,01:01:42.542,"Go on, scoot! Scoot!"
01:01:53.667,01:01:55.917,"Hey, Mr. Wonka, what's this?"
01:01:55.959,01:01:57.875,Oh!
01:01:57.917,01:02:00.125,Let me show you.
01:02:01.375,01:02:02.583,Thank you.
01:02:02.625,01:02:04.917,These are Everlasting Gobstoppers.
01:02:04.959,01:02:08.041,They're for children who are given very little allowance money.
01:02:08.083,01:02:10.542,"You can suck on it all year, and it'll never get any smaller."
01:02:11.834,01:02:12.959,Isn't that neat?
01:02:13.041,01:02:14.583,It's like gum.
01:02:14.625,01:02:16.000,No.
01:02:16.041,01:02:17.542,Gum is for chewing.
01:02:17.583,01:02:21.291,"And if you tried chewing one of these gobstoppers, you'd break all your little teeth off."
01:02:21.333,01:02:25.250,They sure do taste terrific.
01:02:31.583,01:02:33.792,And this is hair toffee.
01:02:33.834,01:02:42.625,"You suck down one of these little boogers, and in exactly half an hour, a brand-new crop of hair will start growing out all over the top of your little noggin."
01:02:42.667,01:02:43.917,And a mustache.
01:02:43.959,01:02:45.583,And a beard.
01:02:45.625,01:02:46.709,Who wants a beard?
01:02:46.750,01:02:49.500,"Well, beatniks for one."
01:02:49.542,01:02:51.375,Folk singers and motorbike riders.
01:02:51.417,01:02:52.625,You know...
01:02:52.667,01:02:55.625,"all those hip, jazzy, super-cool, neat, keen and groovy cats."
01:02:55.667,01:02:56.834,"It's in the fridge, daddy-o."
01:02:56.875,01:02:58.250,Are you hep to the jive?
01:02:58.291,01:02:59.583,Can you dig what I'm laying down?
01:02:59.625,01:03:00.750,I knew that you could.
01:02:59.625,01:03:03.792,"Slide me some skin, soul brother."
01:03:06.542,01:03:12.166,"Unfortunately, the mixture isn't quite right yet, 'cause an Oompa-Loompa tried some yesterday, and well, he..."
01:03:16.458,01:03:18.250,How are you today?
01:03:20.125,01:03:21.542,You look great.
01:03:29.917,01:03:31.709,Watch this.
01:04:00.000,01:04:01.458,You mean that's it?
01:04:01.500,01:04:03.959,Do you even know what it is?
01:04:04.000,01:04:05.166,It's gum.
01:04:05.208,01:04:06.375,Yeah.
01:04:06.417,01:04:09.625,It's a stick of the most amazing and sensational gum in the whole universe.
01:04:09.667,01:04:11.250,Know why?
01:04:11.291,01:04:12.625,Know why?
01:04:12.667,01:04:15.583,'Cause this gum is a full three-course dinner all by itself.
01:04:18.792,01:04:20.834,Why would anyone want that?
01:04:20.875,01:04:23.625,Uh... uh...
01:04:27.583,01:04:30.625,It will be the end of all kitchens and all cooking.
01:04:30.667,01:04:34.500,"Just a little strip of Wonka's magic chewing gum, and that is all you will..."
01:04:34.542,01:04:36.208,"ever need at breakfast, lunch and dinner."
01:04:36.250,01:04:41.542,"This piece of gum happens to be tomato soup, roast beef and blueberry pie."
01:04:41.583,01:04:43.625,It sounds great.
01:04:43.667,01:04:45.625,It sounds weird.
01:04:45.667,01:04:47.125,It sounds like my kind of gum.
01:04:49.750,01:04:51.208,I-I'd rather you didn't.
01:04:51.250,01:04:53.291,There are still one or two things that are little...
01:04:53.333,01:04:55.250,I'm the world record-holder in chewing gum.
01:04:55.291,01:04:56.500,I'm not afraid of anything.
01:05:02.000,01:05:03.500,"How is it, honey?"
01:05:03.542,01:05:04.917,It's amazing!
01:05:04.959,01:05:06.125,Tomato soup!
01:05:06.166,01:05:08.000,I can feel it running down my throat!
01:05:08.041,01:05:09.667,Yeah. Spit it out.
01:05:09.709,01:05:11.125,"Young lady, I think you'd better..."
01:05:11.166,01:05:12.291,It's changing.
01:05:12.333,01:05:15.375,Roast beef with baked potato.
01:05:15.417,01:05:17.083,Crispy skin and butter.
01:05:17.125,01:05:18.625,"Keep chewing, kiddo."
01:05:18.667,01:05:21.375,My little girl's gonna be the first person in the world to have a chewing gum meal.
01:05:21.417,01:05:22.709,WONKA: Yeah.
01:05:22.750,01:05:24.500,I'm just a little concerned about the...
01:05:24.542,01:05:26.417,Blueberry pie and ice cream.
01:05:26.458,01:05:27.792,That part.
01:05:27.834,01:05:29.542,What's happening to her nose?
01:05:34.834,01:05:36.333,It's turning blue.
01:05:37.875,01:05:40.959,MRS. BEAUREGARDE: Your whole nose has gone purple.
01:05:41.000,01:05:43.458,What do you mean?
01:05:43.500,01:05:45.750,"MRS. BEAUREGARDE: Voilet, you're turning violet."
01:05:47.041,01:05:48.583,What's happening?!
01:05:48.625,01:05:54.750,"Well, I told you I hadn't quite got it right, 'cause it goes a little funny when it gets to the dessert."
01:05:54.792,01:05:56.625,It's the blueberry pie that does it.
01:05:56.667,01:05:59.125,I'm terribly sorry.
01:06:07.500,01:06:11.500,"Mother, what's happening to me?"
01:06:21.458,01:06:23.875,Oh. Oh! Oh!
01:06:23.917,01:06:25.750,She's swelling up.
01:06:29.583,01:06:31.125,Like a blueberry.
01:07:00.125,01:07:04.166,"I've tried it on, like, 20 Oompa-Loompas, and each one ended up as a blueberry."
01:07:04.208,01:07:05.917,It's just weird.
01:07:05.959,01:07:08.333,But I can't have a blueberry as a daughter.
01:07:08.375,01:07:09.875,How is she supposed to compete?
01:07:09.917,01:07:11.709,You could put her in a county fair.
01:07:13.166,01:07:14.625,Oh...
01:08:16.500,01:08:17.709,Whoa... oh... oh...!
01:08:45.333,01:08:47.208,VIOLET: Help! Please Help!
01:08:53.041,01:08:56.917,VIOLET: Mr. Wonka!
01:09:01.333,01:09:07.208,I want you to roll Miss Beauregarde into the boat and take her along to the juicing room at once.
01:09:07.250,01:09:08.917,Okay?
01:09:08.959,01:09:10.458,The juicing room?
01:09:10.500,01:09:11.834,What are they gonna do to her there?
01:09:11.875,01:09:16.333,"Uh, they're gonna squeeze her like a little pimple."
01:09:16.375,01:09:20.208,We got to squeeze all that juice out of her immediately.
01:09:21.500,01:09:26.041,"VIOLET: Mother, help me, please!"
01:09:31.875,01:09:34.000,Come on.
01:09:34.041,01:09:35.417,Let's boogie.
01:09:35.458,01:09:39.125,"WONKA: Without the boat, we'll have to move double-time, just to keep on schedule."
01:09:39.166,01:09:40.208,There's far too much to see.
01:09:40.250,01:09:41.792,Mr. Wonka?
01:09:41.834,01:09:43.792,Why did you decide to let people in?
01:09:43.834,01:09:45.917,"Oh, so they could see the factory, of course."
01:09:45.959,01:09:47.875,"But why now, and why only five?"
01:09:47.917,01:09:50.333,"MIKE: What's the special prize, and who gets it?"
01:09:50.375,01:09:52.792,The best kind of prize is a surprise.
01:09:54.333,01:09:56.542,Will Violet always be a blueberry?
01:09:56.583,01:09:58.792,No. Maybe.
01:09:58.834,01:10:00.792,But that's what you get from chewing gum all day.
01:10:00.834,01:10:02.125,It's just disgusting.
01:10:02.166,01:10:04.208,"If you hate gum so much, why do you make it?"
01:10:04.250,01:10:07.750,"Once again, you really shouldn't mumble, 'cause it's kind of starting to bum me out."
01:10:07.792,01:10:09.917,Can you remember the first candy you ever ate?
01:10:14.083,01:10:15.166,No.
01:10:15.208,01:10:20.834,"NARRATOR: In fact, Willy Wonka did remember the first candy he ever ate."
01:11:20.875,01:11:22.500,I'm sorry.
01:11:22.542,01:11:24.542,I was having a flashback.
01:11:25.583,01:11:27.667,I see.
01:11:27.709,01:11:29.792,These flashbacks happen often?
01:11:29.834,01:11:31.750,Increasingly.
01:11:31.792,01:11:32.917,Today.
01:11:40.917,01:11:46.125,"Ah, this is a room I know all about, for you see, Mr. Wonka, I myself am in the nut business."
01:11:46.166,01:11:50.041,Are you using the Havimax 4000 to do your sorting?
01:11:50.083,01:11:51.333,No.
01:11:51.375,01:11:53.375,You're really weird.
01:12:14.250,01:12:15.250,Squirrels!
01:12:15.291,01:12:16.333,WONKA: Yeah!
01:12:16.375,01:12:17.542,Squirrels.
01:12:17.583,01:12:20.792,These squirrels are specially trained to get the nuts out of shells.
01:12:36.542,01:12:37.583,Why use squirrels?
01:12:37.625,01:12:39.375,Why not use Oompa-Loompas?
01:12:39.417,01:12:43.250,Because only squirrels can get the whole walnut out almost every single time.
01:12:45.166,01:12:48.375,"You see how they tap each one with their little knuckles, to make sure it's not bad?"
01:12:48.417,01:12:49.458,"Oh, look, look!"
01:12:51.500,01:12:53.542,I think that one's got a bad nut.
01:12:55.375,01:12:58.417,"Daddy, I want a squirrel."
01:12:58.458,01:12:59.917,I want one.
01:12:59.959,01:13:02.333,"Veruca, dear, you have many marvelous pets."
01:13:02.375,01:13:11.417,All I've got at home is one pony and two dogs and four cats and six bunny rabbits and two parakeets and three canaries and a green parrot and a turtle and a silly old hamster!
01:13:11.458,01:13:13.959,I want a squirrel!
01:13:14.000,01:13:16.458,"All right, pet."
01:13:14.000,01:13:18.000,"Daddy'll get you a squirrel, just as soon as he possibly can."
01:13:18.041,01:13:20.291,VERUCA: But I don't want any old squirrel.
01:13:20.333,01:13:22.250,I want a trained squirrel.
01:13:23.458,01:13:24.583,Very well.
01:13:24.625,01:13:25.875,Mr. Wonka?
01:13:25.917,01:13:29.333,How much do you want for one of these squirrels?
01:13:31.208,01:13:32.834,"Uh, they're not for sale."
01:13:32.875,01:13:34.417,She can't have one.
01:13:38.667,01:13:40.458,Daddy!
01:13:42.208,01:13:43.959,"I'm sorry, darling."
01:13:44.000,01:13:46.500,Mr. Wonka is being unreasonable.
01:13:48.625,01:13:52.583,"If you won't get me a squirrel, I'll get one myself."
01:14:01.417,01:14:02.458,Veruca.
01:14:04.208,01:14:05.458,Little girl?
01:14:09.625,01:14:11.709,"Veruca, come back here at once."
01:14:13.375,01:14:16.041,Veruca!
01:14:27.125,01:14:28.583,WONKA: Little girl?
01:14:28.625,01:14:31.083,"Uh, don't touch that squirrel's nuts."
01:14:31.125,01:14:33.125,It'll make him crazy.
01:14:49.667,01:14:51.500,I'll have you!
01:14:55.959,01:14:57.375,Veruca!
01:15:04.583,01:15:05.625,Veruca!
01:15:13.667,01:15:14.750,Veruca!
01:15:17.333,01:15:19.875,If I could just find the key...
01:15:21.125,01:15:22.750,"Nope, not that one."
01:15:23.333,01:15:24.792,Daddy!
01:15:24.834,01:15:26.083,Veruca!
01:15:26.125,01:15:27.083,No.
01:15:40.125,01:15:41.875,Here it is.
01:15:41.917,01:15:43.583,Here it isn't.
01:15:43.625,01:15:45.875,"Daddy, I want them to stop!"
01:15:56.041,01:15:57.500,What are they doing?
01:15:57.542,01:16:00.208,They're testing to see if she's a bad nut.
01:16:01.959,01:16:03.000,"Oh, my goodness."
01:16:03.041,01:16:05.000,"She is a bad nut, after all."
01:16:12.000,01:16:13.417,MR. SALT: Veruca!
01:16:13.458,01:16:15.291,Daddy!
01:16:15.333,01:16:16.834,Where are they taking her?
01:16:16.875,01:16:19.250,Where all the other bad nuts go-- to the garbage chute.
01:16:21.458,01:16:22.417,Where does the chute go?
01:16:22.458,01:16:23.875,To the incinerator.
01:16:23.917,01:16:26.625,But don't worry.
01:16:27.709,01:16:28.792,Today is Tuesday.
01:16:30.917,01:16:34.041,"Well, there's always the chance they decided not to light it today."
01:16:44.417,01:16:45.458,Aah!
01:16:51.583,01:16:56.458,"Now, she may be stuck in the chute just below the top."
01:16:54.500,01:16:59.125,"If that's the case, all you have to do is just reach in and pull her out."
01:16:59.166,01:17:01.375,Okay?
01:19:31.250,01:19:32.375,Really?
01:19:32.417,01:19:34.250,"Oh, good."
01:19:34.291,01:19:39.667,"I've just been informed that the incinerator's broken, so there should be about three weeks of rotten garbage to break their fall."
01:19:39.709,01:19:42.333,"Well, that's good news."
01:19:42.375,01:19:43.959,Yeah.
01:19:44.000,01:19:45.542,Well...
01:19:45.583,01:19:47.500,let's keep on truckin'.
01:19:49.834,01:19:51.834,I don't know why I didn't think of this earlier.
01:19:51.875,01:19:55.500,The elevator is by far the most efficient way to get around the factory.
01:19:55.542,01:19:57.583,There can't be this many floors.
01:19:57.625,01:20:00.625,"How do you know, Mr. Smartypants?"
01:20:00.667,01:20:03.792,"This isn't just an ordinary up-and-down elevator, by the way."
01:20:03.834,01:20:07.667,"This elevator can go sideways, longways, slantways, and any other ways you can think of."
01:20:07.709,01:20:09.166,You just press any button...
01:20:09.208,01:20:11.000,"and, whoosh, you're off."
01:20:20.166,01:20:22.417,"Oh, look! Look."
01:20:23.583,01:20:26.875,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Fudge Mountain."
01:20:49.333,01:20:50.750,Oh!
01:20:55.625,01:20:57.667,I'd rather not talk about this one.
01:21:08.458,01:21:11.083,This is the puppet hospital and burn center.
01:21:15.542,01:21:18.458,It's relatively new.
01:21:24.458,01:21:26.750,"Ah, the administration offices."
01:21:28.166,01:21:29.750,"Hello, Doris."
01:22:05.375,01:22:07.583,Why is everything here completely pointless?
01:22:07.625,01:22:10.291,Candy doesn't have to have a point.
01:22:10.333,01:22:11.417,That's why it's candy.
01:22:11.458,01:22:13.709,MIKE: It's stupid!
01:22:13.750,01:22:17.792,Candy is a waste of time.
01:22:17.834,01:22:21.291,No son of mine is going to be a chocolatier.
01:22:21.333,01:22:24.417,Then I'll run away...
01:22:21.333,01:22:28.000,"to Switzerland, Bavaria, the candy capitals of the world."
01:22:28.041,01:22:29.583,Go ahead.
01:22:29.625,01:22:31.917,But I won't be here when you come back.
01:23:00.417,01:23:01.834,"Sorry, son."
01:23:01.875,01:23:04.000,We're closing for the night.
01:23:29.875,01:23:31.000,I want to pick a room.
01:23:34.083,01:23:35.458,Go ahead.
01:23:54.709,01:23:56.417,Here.
01:23:56.458,01:23:59.542,Put these on quick and don't take them off whatever you do.
01:23:59.583,01:24:03.333,This light could burn your eyeballs right out of your skulls.
01:24:03.375,01:24:05.834,"And we certainly don't want that, now, do we?"
01:24:08.959,01:24:15.792,This is the testing room for my very latest and greatest invention-- television chocolate.
01:24:15.834,01:24:28.625,"One day, it occurred to me: Hey, if television can break up a photograph into millions and millions of tiny little pieces and send it whizzing through the air then reassemble it on the other end-- why can't I do the same thing with chocolate?"
01:24:28.667,01:24:34.542,"Why can't I send a real bar of chocolate through the television, all ready to be eaten?"
01:24:34.583,01:24:37.208,I'm not gonna touch it.
01:24:41.083,01:24:42.875,MIKE: It is impossible.
01:24:42.917,01:24:45.917,You don't understand anything about science.
01:24:45.959,01:24:50.166,"First off, there's a difference between waves and particles."
01:24:50.208,01:24:52.041,Duh!
01:24:52.083,01:24:57.583,"Second, the amount of power it would take to convert energy into matter would be like nine atomic bombs."
01:24:57.625,01:24:59.250,Mumbler!
01:24:59.291,01:25:00.834,Seriously...
01:25:00.875,01:25:04.000,I cannot understand a single word you're saying.
01:25:07.375,01:25:08.834,Okeydokey.
01:25:08.875,01:25:15.667,I shall now send a bar of chocolate from one end of the room to the other by television.
01:25:15.709,01:25:17.333,Bring in the chocolate!
01:25:37.417,01:25:39.417,It's got to be real big.
01:25:39.458,01:25:43.834,'Cause you know how on TV you can film a regular-size man and he comes out looking this tall?
01:25:43.875,01:25:45.417,Same basic principle.
01:26:17.583,01:26:18.959,It's gone.
01:26:19.000,01:26:21.750,Told you.
01:26:21.792,01:26:27.000,That bar of chocolate is now rushing through the air above our heads in a million tiny little pieces.
01:26:27.041,01:26:28.041,Come over here.
01:26:28.083,01:26:30.291,"Come on, come on."
01:26:35.458,01:26:38.125,Watch the screen.
01:26:40.709,01:26:42.625,Here it comes.
01:26:42.667,01:26:44.709,Look.
01:26:48.834,01:26:49.959,Take it.
01:26:50.000,01:26:52.083,It's just a picture on a screen.
01:26:52.125,01:26:53.875,Scaredy cat.
01:26:53.917,01:26:55.333,You take it.
01:26:56.625,01:26:58.959,Go on.
01:27:06.667,01:27:08.000,Go on.
01:27:16.542,01:27:18.583,Holy buckets.
01:27:20.834,01:27:22.250,Eat it.
01:27:22.291,01:27:23.291,Go on.
01:27:23.333,01:27:24.458,It'll be delicious.
01:27:24.500,01:27:29.709,"It's the same bar, it's just gotten a little smaller on the journey, that's all."
01:27:37.375,01:27:38.542,It's great.
01:27:38.583,01:27:40.792,It's a miracle.
01:27:42.500,01:27:47.750,"So imagine you're sitting at home, watching television, and suddenly a commercial will flash onto the screen."
01:27:47.792,01:27:54.083,A voice will say: Wonka's chocolates are the best in the world.
01:27:54.125,01:27:56.750,"If you don't believe us, try one for yourself."
01:27:56.792,01:28:01.917,And you simply reach out and take it.
01:28:01.959,01:28:03.125,How about that?
01:28:03.166,01:28:04.333,So can you send other things?
01:28:04.375,01:28:07.542,"Say, like, breakfast cereal?"
01:28:07.583,01:28:10.250,Do you have any idea what breakfast cereal's made of?
01:28:10.291,01:28:13.750,It's those little curly wooden shavings you find in pencil sharpeners.
01:28:13.792,01:28:16.458,"But could you send it by television, if you wanted to?"
01:28:16.500,01:28:17.583,'Course I could.
01:28:17.625,01:28:18.834,What about people?
01:28:18.875,01:28:20.667,"Well, why would I want to send a person?"
01:28:20.709,01:28:22.166,They don't taste very good at all.
01:28:22.208,01:28:24.875,Don't realize what you've invented?
01:28:24.917,01:28:26.083,It's a teleporter.
01:28:26.125,01:28:28.792,It's the most important invention in the history of the world.
01:28:28.834,01:28:30.542,And all you think about is chocolate.
01:28:30.583,01:28:33.375,"Calm down, Mike."
01:28:33.417,01:28:35.458,I think Mr. Wonka knows what he's talking about.
01:28:35.500,01:28:37.542,"No, he doesn't."
01:28:37.583,01:28:40.625,"You think he's a genius, but he's an idiot."
01:28:40.667,01:28:43.417,But I'm not.
01:28:47.875,01:28:48.917,"Hey, little boy..."
01:28:50.750,01:28:52.500,Don't push my button.
01:29:33.375,01:29:34.792,He's gone.
01:29:34.834,01:29:37.208,"Let's go check the television, see what we get."
01:29:38.542,01:29:41.500,I sure hope no part of him gets left behind.
01:29:41.542,01:29:42.792,What do you mean?
01:29:42.834,01:29:46.709,"Well, sometimes only half the little pieces find their way through."
01:29:48.458,01:29:52.291,"If you had to choose only one half of your son, which one would it be?"
01:29:52.333,01:29:54.500,What kind of a question is that?
01:29:54.542,01:29:56.875,No need to snap.
01:29:56.917,01:29:58.959,Just a question.
01:29:59.000,01:30:00.792,Try every channel.
01:30:00.834,01:30:02.834,I'm starting to feel a little anxious.
01:30:08.000,01:30:08.959,There he is.
01:30:09.000,01:30:10.125,Mike.
01:31:33.000,01:31:34.750,Ew! Somebody grab him.
01:31:34.792,01:31:37.041,Help me.
01:31:37.083,01:31:38.959,Help me.
01:31:39.000,01:31:41.125,"Oh, thank heavens."
01:31:41.166,01:31:42.875,He's completely unharmed.
01:31:42.917,01:31:44.041,Unharmed?
01:31:44.083,01:31:46.208,What are you talking about?
01:31:49.000,01:31:51.208,Just put me back in the other way.
01:31:51.250,01:31:53.625,There is no other way.
01:31:53.667,01:31:55.125,"It's television, not telephone."
01:31:55.166,01:31:56.542,There's quite a difference.
01:31:56.583,01:31:59.083,And what exactly do you propose to do about it?
01:31:59.125,01:32:01.583,I don't know.
01:32:01.625,01:32:05.250,But young men are extremely springy; they stretch like mad.
01:32:06.542,01:32:08.250,Let's go put him in the taffy puller.
01:32:08.291,01:32:09.875,Taffy puller?!
01:32:09.917,01:32:11.709,"Hey, that was my idea."
01:32:13.875,01:32:16.208,"Boy, is he going to be skinny."
01:32:16.250,01:32:17.792,WONKA: Yeah.
01:32:17.834,01:32:20.750,Taffy puller.
01:32:20.792,01:32:24.750,I want you to take Mr. Teavee and his...
01:32:24.792,01:32:27.875,"little boy up to the taffy puller, okay?"
01:32:27.917,01:32:30.333,Stretch him out.
01:32:37.709,01:32:40.166,Whew!
01:32:40.208,01:32:41.500,On with the tour.
01:32:51.083,01:32:53.709,There's still so much left to see.
01:32:53.750,01:32:56.417,"Now, how many children are left?"
01:32:58.917,01:33:03.583,"Mr. Wonka, Charlie's the only one left now."
01:33:05.750,01:33:07.333,You mean you're the only one?
01:33:07.375,01:33:09.375,"Yes, sir."
01:33:09.417,01:33:11.542,What happened to the others?
01:33:15.750,01:33:16.917,"Oh, my dear boy."
01:33:16.959,01:33:18.125,"Well, that means you've won."
01:33:18.166,01:33:20.917,"Oh, I do congratulate you, I really do."
01:33:20.959,01:33:22.375,I'm absolutely delighted.
01:33:22.417,01:33:24.166,"I had a hunch, you know, right from the beginning."
01:33:24.208,01:33:25.333,Well done.
01:33:25.375,01:33:27.417,Now we mustn't dilly or dally.
01:33:27.458,01:33:31.208,Because we have an enormous number of things to do before the day's out.
01:33:29.458,01:33:33.917,"But luckily for us, we have the great glass elevator to speed things al..."
01:33:40.917,01:33:42.375,Speed things along.
01:33:44.333,01:33:46.417,Come on.
01:33:52.667,01:33:53.792,Up and out?
01:33:53.834,01:33:55.417,What kind of a room is that?
01:33:55.458,01:33:56.917,Hold on.
01:34:06.083,01:34:07.333,"Oh, my goodness."
01:34:07.375,01:34:09.458,We're going to need to go much faster.
01:34:09.500,01:34:11.750,"Otherwise, we'll just never break through."
01:34:11.792,01:34:13.250,Break through what?
01:34:13.291,01:34:16.250,I've been longing to press that button for years.
01:34:16.291,01:34:18.709,"Well, here we go."
01:34:18.750,01:34:19.709,Up and out.
01:34:19.750,01:34:21.458,But do you really mean...?
01:34:21.500,01:34:22.458,"Yeah, I do."
01:34:22.500,01:34:24.041,But it's made of glass.
01:34:24.083,01:34:26.208,It'll smash into a million pieces.
01:35:01.542,01:35:04.333,"Augustus, please don't eat your fingers."
01:35:04.375,01:35:06.709,But I taste so good.
01:35:19.834,01:35:22.500,"Look, Mother, I'm much more flexible now."
01:35:22.542,01:35:25.583,"Yes, but you're blue."
01:35:48.000,01:35:50.917,"Daddy, I want a flying glass elevator."
01:35:50.959,01:35:54.583,"Veruca, the only thing you're getting today is a bath and that's final."
01:35:54.625,01:35:55.959,But I want it!
01:36:12.542,01:36:15.750,Where do you live?
01:36:15.792,01:36:18.542,"Right over there, that little house."
01:36:23.125,01:36:24.834,What time do you think they'll be back?
01:36:24.875,01:36:26.667,"I don't know, dear."
01:36:26.709,01:36:28.041,Hm.
01:36:38.709,01:36:41.709,I think there's someone at the door.
01:36:41.750,01:36:42.875,"Hi, Mom!"
01:36:44.375,01:36:45.583,Hi.
01:36:45.625,01:36:46.667,CHARLIE: Mom!
01:36:46.709,01:36:47.667,Dad! We're back.
01:36:47.709,01:36:48.667,MR. BUCKET: Charlie.
01:36:48.709,01:36:49.750,MRS. BUCKET: Charlie.
01:36:50.917,01:36:52.917,Goodness.
01:36:54.792,01:36:56.166,This is Willy Wonka.
01:36:56.208,01:36:57.917,He gave us a ride home.
01:36:57.959,01:36:59.250,I see that.
01:36:59.291,01:37:02.625,You must be the boy's...
01:37:02.667,01:37:04.417,Parents?
01:37:04.458,01:37:06.333,That.
01:37:04.458,01:37:08.750,He says Charlie's won something.
01:37:09.792,01:37:16.041,"Not just some something, the most something something of any something that's ever been."
01:37:16.083,01:37:19.166,I'm gonna give this little boy my entire factory.
01:37:20.667,01:37:22.333,You must be joking.
01:37:22.375,01:37:31.208,"WONKA: No, really, it's true, 'cause, you see, a few months ago, I was having my semi-annual haircut, and I had the strangest revelation."
01:37:45.041,01:37:52.500,"In that one silver hair, I saw reflected my life's work, my factory, my beloved Oompa-Loompas."
01:37:52.542,01:37:56.333,Who would watch over them after I was gone?
01:37:56.375,01:37:58.792,I realized in that moment...
01:37:58.834,01:38:01.709,I must find a heir.
01:38:01.750,01:38:05.041,"And I did, Charlie."
01:38:05.083,01:38:07.583,You.
01:38:08.792,01:38:11.291,CHARLIE: That's why you sent out the golden tickets.
01:38:11.333,01:38:13.000,Uh-huh.
01:38:13.041,01:38:14.333,What are Oompa-Loompas?
01:38:14.375,01:38:20.208,"WONKA: I invited five children to the factory, and the one who was the least rotten would be the winner."
01:38:20.250,01:38:21.834,"GRANDPA JOE: That's you, Charlie."
01:38:21.875,01:38:23.208,"WONKA: So, what do you say?"
01:38:23.250,01:38:27.125,Are you ready to leave all this behind and come live with me at the factory?
01:38:27.166,01:38:29.041,Sure. Of course.
01:38:29.083,01:38:31.959,"I mean, it's all right for my family to come, too."
01:38:32.000,01:38:34.250,"Oh, my dear boy, of course they can't."
01:38:34.291,01:38:39.291,You can't run a chocolate factory with a family hanging over you like an old dead goose.
01:38:39.333,01:38:40.500,No offense.
01:38:40.542,01:38:42.458,None taken... jerk.
01:38:44.250,01:38:46.583,A chocolatier has to run free and solo.
01:38:46.625,01:38:50.125,"He has to follow his dreams, gosh darn the consequences."
01:38:51.417,01:38:52.709,Look at me.
01:38:52.750,01:38:55.625,"I had no family, and I'm a giant success."
01:38:55.667,01:39:01.041,"So, if I go with you to the factory, I won't ever see my family again?"
01:39:01.083,01:39:02.166,Yeah.
01:39:02.208,01:39:03.458,Consider that a bonus.
01:39:05.959,01:39:07.333,Then I'm not going.
01:39:07.375,01:39:10.625,I wouldn't give up my family for anything.
01:39:10.667,01:39:13.417,Not for all the chocolate in the world.
01:39:15.583,01:39:17.625,"Oh, I see."
01:39:19.208,01:39:20.583,That's weird.
01:39:24.500,01:39:27.542,"There's other candy, too, besides chocolate."
01:39:27.583,01:39:29.959,"I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka."
01:39:30.000,01:39:31.542,I'm staying here.
01:39:33.875,01:39:35.917,Wow.
01:39:37.834,01:39:40.625,"Well, that's just..."
01:39:40.667,01:39:43.500,unexpected and...
01:39:43.542,01:39:45.625,weird.
01:39:52.542,01:39:54.667,"But I suppose, in that case, I'll just..."
01:39:57.500,01:39:58.875,Good-bye then.
01:40:02.000,01:40:04.041,Sure you won't change your mind?
01:40:05.834,01:40:08.250,I'm sure.
01:40:17.125,01:40:19.625,Okay. Bye.
01:40:40.375,01:40:44.250,Things are going to get much better.
01:40:44.291,01:40:50.625,"NARRATOR: And, for once, Grandma Georgina knew exactly what she was talking about."
01:40:50.667,01:40:55.875,"The next morning, Charlie helped his parents fix a hole in the roof."
01:40:55.917,01:40:59.917,Grandpa Joe spent the whole day out of bed.
01:40:59.959,01:41:02.291,He didn't feel tired at all.
01:41:02.333,01:41:10.291,"Charlie's father got a better job at the toothpaste factory, repairing the machine that had replaced him."
01:41:12.792,01:41:16.000,Things have never been better for the Bucket family.
01:41:16.041,01:41:20.542,The same could not be said for Willy Wonka.
01:41:20.583,01:41:22.500,I can't put my finger on it.
01:41:22.542,01:41:27.500,"Candy's always been the only thing I was ever certain of, and now I'm just not certain at all."
01:41:27.542,01:41:31.166,"I don't know which flavors to make, I don't know which ideas to try."
01:41:31.208,01:41:34.041,"I'm second-guessing myself, which is nuts."
01:41:34.083,01:41:38.625,"I've always made whatever candy I felt like, and I..."
01:41:44.834,01:41:46.166,"That's just it, isn't it?"
01:41:46.208,01:41:52.333,"I make the candy I feel like, but now I feel terrible, so the candy's terrible."
01:41:52.375,01:41:53.875,You're very good.
01:42:06.667,01:42:09.417,Pity about that chocolate fella Wendell.
01:42:09.458,01:42:10.500,"Uh, Walter."
01:42:10.542,01:42:11.583,Willy Wonka.
01:42:11.625,01:42:12.875,That's the one.
01:42:12.917,01:42:16.750,Says here in the papers his new candies aren't selling very well.
01:42:16.792,01:42:20.542,But I suppose maybe he's just a rotten egg who deserves it.
01:42:20.583,01:42:21.542,Yep.
01:42:21.583,01:42:23.208,"Oh, really?"
01:42:23.250,01:42:25.166,You ever met him?
01:42:26.208,01:42:27.417,I did.
01:42:27.458,01:42:32.083,"I thought he was great, at first, but then, he didn't turn out so nice."
01:42:32.125,01:42:34.917,He also has a funny haircut.
01:42:34.959,01:42:37.166,I do not.
01:42:37.208,01:42:38.917,Why are you here?
01:42:38.959,01:42:40.458,I don't feel so hot.
01:42:40.500,01:42:43.959,What makes you feel better when you feel terrible?
01:42:44.000,01:42:45.208,My family.
01:42:45.250,01:42:47.291,Ew.
01:42:49.166,01:42:51.291,What do you have against my family?
01:42:51.333,01:42:54.709,"It's not just your family, it's the whole idea of..."
01:42:58.709,01:43:03.333,"You know, they're always telling you what to do, what not to do, and it's not conducive to a creative atmosphere."
01:43:03.375,01:43:06.792,"Usually they're just trying to protect you, because they love you."
01:43:09.208,01:43:11.458,"If you don't believe me, you should ask."
01:43:11.500,01:43:14.500,"Ask who, my father?"
01:43:15.542,01:43:17.709,No way.
01:43:17.750,01:43:20.417,At least not by myself.
01:43:20.458,01:43:22.583,You want me to go with you?
01:43:24.583,01:43:26.875,"Hey... hey, what a good idea."
01:43:27.792,01:43:29.041,Yeah.
01:43:31.000,01:43:32.083,And you know what?
01:43:32.125,01:43:33.250,I've got transpor...
01:43:38.208,01:43:40.458,I have to be more careful where I park this thing.
01:44:11.709,01:44:13.709,I think we've got the wrong house.
01:44:27.834,01:44:30.375,Do you have an appointment?
01:44:30.417,01:44:32.959,"No, but he's overdue."
01:44:35.834,01:44:37.041,Open.
01:44:38.917,01:44:43.375,"Now, let's see what the damage is, shall we?"
01:45:23.000,01:45:26.041,Heavens.
01:45:26.083,01:45:29.458,I haven't seen bicuspids like these since...
01:45:32.041,01:45:35.417,...since...
01:45:44.000,01:45:45.959,Willy?
01:45:46.000,01:45:49.250,"Hi, Dad."
01:45:59.291,01:46:05.583,"All these years, and you haven't flossed."
01:46:05.625,01:46:08.709,Not once.
01:46:33.041,01:46:40.333,"NARRATOR: It was on this day that Willy Wonka repeated his offer to Charlie, who accepted on one condition..."
01:46:40.375,01:46:42.375,Sorry we're late.
01:46:42.417,01:46:44.166,We were brainstorming.
01:46:44.208,01:46:45.917,Thought I heard thunder.
01:46:45.959,01:46:47.583,"Can you stay for dinner, Willy?"
01:46:47.625,01:46:50.083,"Oh, yes, please."
01:46:50.125,01:46:52.583,I'll shuffle the plates.
01:47:00.000,01:47:03.166,You smell like peanuts.
01:47:04.709,01:47:06.709,I love peanuts.
01:47:06.750,01:47:08.000,"Oh, thank you."
01:47:08.041,01:47:12.083,You smell like...
01:47:14.500,01:47:15.667,I like it.
01:47:21.250,01:47:22.333,"Elbows off the table, Charlie."
01:47:23.875,01:47:25.917,How do you feel about little raspberry kites?
01:47:25.959,01:47:28.041,With licorice instead of string.
01:47:28.083,01:47:29.917,Boys...
01:47:29.959,01:47:31.291,no business at the dinner table.
01:47:31.333,01:47:32.750,"Sorry, Mum."
01:47:32.792,01:47:36.291,"I think you're onto something, though, Charlie."
01:47:46.375,01:48:01.917,"NARRATOR: In the end, Charlie Bucket won a chocolate factory, but Willy Wonka got something even better-- a family."
01:48:01.959,01:48:11.125,And one thing was absolutely certain: life had never been sweeter.
