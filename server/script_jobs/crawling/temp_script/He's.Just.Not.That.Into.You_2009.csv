00:00:48.181,00:00:50.083,Because you smell like dog poo.
00:00:50.216,00:00:52.819,"You're so stupid, just like dog poo."
00:00:53.153,00:00:54.487,You're made out of poo!
00:00:55.588,00:00:59.225,GIGI: But usually someone is there to offer words of wisdom.
00:00:59.359,00:01:00.560,Made...
00:01:00.693,00:01:02.195,...of...
00:01:02.529,00:01:03.830,...dog...
00:01:04.164,00:01:05.432,...poo.
00:01:05.565,00:01:06.800,Honey...
00:01:07.133,00:01:12.338,...do you know why that little boy did those things and said those things?
00:01:12.472,00:01:14.340,It's because he likes you.
00:01:15.075,00:01:16.643,GIGI: And there it is.
00:01:16.776,00:01:19.512,That's the beginning of our problem.
00:01:20.480,00:01:25.752,That little boy is doing those terrible things because he's got a crush on you.
00:01:26.085,00:01:27.353,GIGI: Do you know what this means?
00:01:27.487,00:01:28.588,We're all encouraged...
00:01:28.721,00:01:29.856,"...no, programmed..."
00:01:30.190,00:01:32.625,...to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk...
00:01:32.759,00:01:35.328,...that means he likes you.
00:01:37.797,00:01:40.400,Here's the problem: He likes you too much.
00:01:40.533,00:01:42.435,You're too pretty and too awesome.
00:01:42.569,00:01:44.671,-Yes. -He can't handle it.
00:01:47.140,00:01:49.742,That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.
00:01:49.876,00:01:52.245,I'm sure he just lost your number.
00:01:53.680,00:01:58.351,He's not asking you out because he's intimidated by your professional success.
00:02:08.261,00:02:12.165,Trust me. It's because he's just getting out of a serious relationship.
00:02:12.632,00:02:16.302,Trust me. It's because he's never had a serious relationship.
00:02:28.748,00:02:30.717,GIGI: Why do we say this stuff to each other?
00:02:31.317,00:02:34.454,Is it possible that it's because we're too scared...
00:02:34.587,00:02:37.724,...and it's too hard to say the one obvious truth...
00:02:37.857,00:02:40.860,...that's staring everyone in the face?
00:02:57.744,00:02:59.779,So Janine says you're a real-estate agent.
00:02:59.913,00:03:02.315,"Yeah, but I'm not one of those cheesy ones..."
00:03:02.448,00:03:05.385,...that puts my headshots on bus benches and grocery carts.
00:03:05.518,00:03:07.787,"So just, like, Frisbees and notepads?"
00:03:07.921,00:03:08.955,Basically.
00:03:09.289,00:03:11.224,-It's much classier. -My thoughts exactly.
00:03:14.794,00:03:17.497,Wonder why Janine never thought to introduce us before.
00:03:17.630,00:03:19.465,I don't know. I don't know.
00:03:19.599,00:03:22.635,"-Hey, guys. Want another round? -You want one more?"
00:03:23.770,00:03:28.908,"Only if you do. I mean, if you need to get going, I totally...."
00:03:30.376,00:03:31.511,Uh....
00:03:32.245,00:03:34.347,"Okay, well...."
00:03:35.782,00:03:37.517,Sure. One more. Ketel and soda?
00:03:38.384,00:03:39.886,"And a beer, please."
00:03:40.220,00:03:41.921,WAITRESS: Be right back.
00:03:42.889,00:03:46.926,"GIGI: Well, Conor, I had a really nice time. -It was really nice meeting you."
00:03:47.694,00:03:49.596,-Bye. -See you.
00:03:57.804,00:03:58.805,"Hey, it's me."
00:03:58.938,00:04:01.507,"He's cute, and I think it went well."
00:04:01.641,00:04:06.279,And I think he might be leaving me a message at home as we speak.
00:04:06.412,00:04:10.483,"Hey, it's me. Just wanted to let you know I was thinking about you."
00:04:10.950,00:04:13.553,"Oh, that's very sweet of you, Conor. Thanks."
00:04:13.686,00:04:16.689,"Listen, I was wondering if you wanted to grab a late bite."
00:04:17.657,00:04:19.459,Tonight? I....
00:04:19.592,00:04:23.663,"No, I was supposed to meet friends but I'm burnt out. Don't be mad at me."
00:04:23.796,00:04:26.499,"No, of course, I'm not mad. Well, I'll be up for a while."
00:04:26.633,00:04:28.568,-Do you wanna go ahead of me? -I'll be up.
00:04:28.701,00:04:29.902,"-Oh, can you hold on? -Okay."
00:04:30.036,00:04:32.405,"No, that's fine. You just have one thing, so...."
00:04:32.538,00:04:34.374,"No, technically I have six..."
00:04:34.507,00:04:37.977,"...and I'm mulling over a gum purchase, so I think you should go."
00:04:38.311,00:04:39.579,Okay.
00:04:39.712,00:04:40.947,Let me call you right back.
00:04:41.281,00:04:42.315,All right. Okay.
00:04:42.448,00:04:43.983,-Hi. -Hey.
00:04:44.317,00:04:46.452,"Just that and that, please."
00:04:46.586,00:04:48.454,Thank you.
00:04:52.725,00:04:53.993,"Oh, my word."
00:04:55.862,00:04:57.430,Seriously? That's not possible.
00:04:57.563,00:05:00.600,"I just deposited cash three days ago, so it's just not possible."
00:05:00.733,00:05:03.569,"Oh, it's not that. Let me check something."
00:05:04.404,00:05:05.705,"Congratulations, you won."
00:05:06.706,00:05:07.740,What?
00:05:07.874,00:05:11.911,Our Funky Fall promotion. You're our 1000th customer this month.
00:05:12.045,00:05:13.713,What?
00:05:19.085,00:05:20.553,Are you kidding me?
00:05:21.087,00:05:22.822,I don't do kidding.
00:05:23.856,00:05:26.693,"Oh, my God. I can't believe this, it's so exciting."
00:05:27.560,00:05:30.897,"Oh, my God. I never won anything before."
00:05:31.030,00:05:34.600,This is the most exciting thing that ever happened to me. Is that sad?
00:05:35.468,00:05:37.670,Yea-- No. I don't think so.
00:05:37.804,00:05:40.339,-Really? -Yes.
00:05:40.473,00:05:42.508,Thank you! Come here.
00:05:43.910,00:05:44.911,Wow.
00:05:49.916,00:05:51.784,-Hey. -Hey.
00:05:51.918,00:05:54.921,-How was the date? -It was fine. Whatever.
00:05:55.054,00:05:57.023,-Why are you here? -My cable's out.
00:05:57.356,00:06:00.626,"Come on, Spiewak, it's not the Ice Capades."
00:06:00.760,00:06:03.563,"You didn't hear the phone ring by any chance, did you?"
00:06:03.696,00:06:05.965,"-No, I didn't. -Shit."
00:06:06.099,00:06:08.868,"Anna gave me the old, I'll call you right back."
00:06:09.001,00:06:11.070,"Oh, shit, yeah? Well, how long ago?"
00:06:11.404,00:06:15.007,That was 22 minutes ago.
00:06:15.541,00:06:16.943,Do I call back?
00:06:17.076,00:06:19.145,"Should you call back? No, absolutely not."
00:06:20.546,00:06:22.882,I'm gonna call back and say I'm going to bed.
00:06:23.015,00:06:25.818,What? No. It's 9:30. You're gonna--?
00:06:25.952,00:06:27.086,"No, it's a great idea."
00:06:27.420,00:06:30.456,"I'll call and say, In case you were gonna call me back, don't..."
00:06:30.590,00:06:32.692,...because I'll be sleeping. A genius idea.
00:06:32.825,00:06:34.060,"ALEX: Okay, no, that's brilliant."
00:06:34.393,00:06:37.563,"When you wake up you can say, I'm awake now, I'm available to take your call."
00:06:38.998,00:06:40.733,"Oh, gosh. A second."
00:06:40.867,00:06:43.436,-Sorry about that. -It's all right.
00:06:43.903,00:06:47.673,"I was-- Wait, what was I saying again?"
00:06:48.007,00:06:50.777,"You don't wanna be like your mother, wake up one morning..."
00:06:50.910,00:06:52.845,...and realize you never pursued your dreams.
00:06:52.979,00:06:54.413,Is that what I was saying?
00:06:54.547,00:06:56.048,"-You want some gum? -No, thank you."
00:06:56.182,00:07:00.052,"God, that's kind of heavy for a grocery chat."
00:07:00.186,00:07:02.588,"-No, that's okay. -Isn't it?"
00:07:02.722,00:07:05.057,-Sorry. -I actually might be able to help.
00:07:05.191,00:07:09.595,"Yeah, I know a guy at my office who deals exclusively with music clients."
00:07:09.729,00:07:10.830,-Are you kidding? -Uh-uh.
00:07:10.963,00:07:12.698,"Oh, my God."
00:07:12.832,00:07:15.067,-Are you my savior or something? -No.
00:07:15.201,00:07:18.070,-Can you hold this for a second? -Yeah.
00:07:19.605,00:07:21.474,"Oh, this is so unexpected."
00:07:33.019,00:07:34.720,Okay....
00:07:34.854,00:07:35.888,I don't....
00:07:36.189,00:07:38.157,I'm married.
00:07:39.158,00:07:40.626,I don't do this.
00:07:40.760,00:07:44.030,You don't do what? You don't help struggling singers?
00:07:45.898,00:07:51.170,Not hot yoga-instructing singers...
00:07:51.737,00:07:54.207,...who are incredibly charming.
00:07:56.809,00:07:58.678,ANNA: Hm.
00:07:59.245,00:08:02.582,"Well, you could-- You could give me your card."
00:08:02.715,00:08:05.051,"That's legit, right? Is that allowed?"
00:08:05.184,00:08:06.252,I could do that.
00:08:06.586,00:08:08.187,"-Yeah. -That'd be okay, right?"
00:08:08.521,00:08:10.056,Yeah.
00:08:12.592,00:08:13.860,"Great, thank you so much."
00:08:13.993,00:08:15.795,Course. Do you need help to your car?
00:08:15.928,00:08:18.130,"-Where'd you park? -No, I'm fine. It's okay."
00:08:19.732,00:08:21.667,-It was very nice to meet you. -Yeah.
00:08:21.801,00:08:23.536,Okay.
00:08:35.214,00:08:36.616,Who was that?
00:08:37.216,00:08:41.921,"-Oh, that was a prospective client. -Oh."
00:08:42.688,00:08:44.156,Okay.
00:08:45.825,00:08:48.528,I can talk to a woman. It doesn't have to be like that.
00:08:48.661,00:08:50.563,No. Absolutely not.
00:08:51.731,00:08:53.933,-Just drive. -Relax.
00:09:12.552,00:09:14.854,-Hi. -Hi.
00:09:14.987,00:09:17.123,-How you doing? -Good.
00:09:17.256,00:09:20.259,-Yeah? -Yeah. I just got off the phone.
00:09:20.593,00:09:22.595,"-Yeah? -Yeah, with my little sister."
00:09:22.728,00:09:25.665,-How's she doing? -She's getting married.
00:09:26.098,00:09:27.600,Really?
00:09:27.733,00:09:29.068,BETH: Yeah.
00:09:29.201,00:09:30.303,NEIL: Great.
00:09:30.636,00:09:31.971,You really think that's great?
00:09:32.104,00:09:33.773,Yeah.
00:09:33.906,00:09:36.008,Devon seems like...
00:09:36.142,00:09:37.944,...a great guy.
00:09:40.613,00:09:43.849,"Well, so you think it's great that they're getting married..."
00:09:43.983,00:09:49.322,"...but you don't ever feel like we're going against nature, or something..."
00:09:49.655,00:09:51.924,...by not getting married?
00:09:53.626,00:09:54.694,No.
00:09:55.161,00:10:00.032,Going against nature is like the cat who suckled that monkey.
00:10:00.166,00:10:04.604,You and I are just two people who happen not to be married.
00:10:04.904,00:10:08.174,Let me tell you something. People who get married are not to be trusted.
00:10:08.307,00:10:10.676,You are so weird.
00:10:10.810,00:10:12.011,They're not. You know why?
00:10:12.144,00:10:14.914,"Because if you are so legitimately happy, honestly..."
00:10:15.047,00:10:17.817,...you wouldn't feel the need to make a big show out of it.
00:10:17.950,00:10:19.719,You wouldn't have to broadcast it.
00:10:19.852,00:10:21.654,They do it because they're insecure...
00:10:21.787,00:10:24.991,...and they think getting married's what they're supposed to be doing.
00:10:25.124,00:10:27.793,So they're lying to themselves and to other people.
00:10:27.927,00:10:29.195,Seriously.
00:10:29.328,00:10:32.798,Think about you and your friends. Okay?
00:10:32.932,00:10:35.101,These women you have great relationships with...
00:10:35.234,00:10:38.137,"...you're close to them, some of them you've known for years."
00:10:38.270,00:10:39.805,But you don't feel the need...
00:10:39.939,00:10:45.311,...to write a $45 check to the state of Maryland for a friendship certificate.
00:10:45.645,00:10:47.179,"-Yeah. No, I get that. -Right?"
00:10:47.313,00:10:50.349,"Why should it be any different, you know, with me and you?"
00:10:50.683,00:10:54.186,"We're very happy, I love you, I'm committed to you..."
00:10:54.320,00:10:56.689,"...we have a great life, you know?"
00:10:56.822,00:10:57.857,"Yes, you're right."
00:10:57.990,00:11:01.093,Why can't we just be happy?
00:11:01.227,00:11:02.962,You're right.
00:11:03.095,00:11:05.765,-I'm gonna get you some more tea. -Okay.
00:11:16.108,00:11:17.710,You have no messages.
00:11:17.843,00:11:25.818,"Main menu. To send a message-- Okay, so clearly he hasn't called."
00:11:25.951,00:11:27.787,Maybe he's away on business.
00:11:27.920,00:11:30.956,He sells real estate. In Baltimore.
00:11:31.090,00:11:33.359,-Staying in town is his business. -Right.
00:11:33.692,00:11:35.261,"Well, look, let me tell you."
00:11:35.394,00:11:39.231,"After I went out with Ben for the first time, he didn't call me for 11 days."
00:11:39.365,00:11:42.001,Eleven days. And now he's the world's best husband.
00:11:42.134,00:11:43.269,That happens all the time.
00:11:43.402,00:11:44.804,-Really? -Really.
00:11:45.171,00:11:47.039,JANINE: You want coffee?
00:11:47.173,00:11:49.742,-I got you 2 percent. -Thanks.
00:11:54.180,00:11:55.848,This is all your fault.
00:11:55.981,00:11:57.850,What? Why?
00:11:57.983,00:11:59.418,You set us up.
00:11:59.752,00:12:05.424,"No. You asked me if I know any guys, and I gave Conor your phone number."
00:12:05.758,00:12:07.259,That's not a setup.
00:12:07.393,00:12:10.229,"When I do a setup, I weigh the pros and cons."
00:12:10.362,00:12:12.431,I do my due diligence.
00:12:12.765,00:12:17.136,All I know about Conor is that he sold us this house.
00:12:20.773,00:12:23.175,"Seriously, stop."
00:12:24.043,00:12:26.946,He said he always hangs out after work at the City Supper Club.
00:12:27.079,00:12:29.281,Maybe I should do a little drive-by?
00:12:30.116,00:12:31.417,Please don't.
00:12:32.418,00:12:33.786,He'll call.
00:12:39.258,00:12:43.062,"AMBER: Okay, I have a question: Why'd they even invent caller ID?"
00:12:43.195,00:12:45.431,"It's, like, who is this service helping?"
00:12:45.764,00:12:47.466,"I mean, for centuries...."
00:12:48.134,00:12:51.871,"Okay, well maybe not centuries, but for, like, a lot and lot of years..."
00:12:52.004,00:12:55.074,"...people have been answering their phone, not knowing who it is..."
00:12:55.207,00:12:57.543,"...and as far as I can tell, no one's died from that."
00:12:57.877,00:13:02.448,"And it's like if the police wanna know who placed a call, they could trace it."
00:13:02.781,00:13:04.183,"I mean, what am I, the police?"
00:13:04.316,00:13:08.087,This constant obsession with needing to know who's calling all the time...
00:13:08.220,00:13:09.455,"...it's, like, so gross."
00:13:09.788,00:13:13.292,"Like, you pick up the phone, you find out who it is, then you know."
00:13:13.425,00:13:14.994,"It's, like...."
00:13:15.828,00:13:17.496,"Look, all I'm saying..."
00:13:18.464,00:13:22.334,"...if a guy doesn't call me, I would like to reserve the right..."
00:13:22.468,00:13:25.504,...to call him at 15-minute intervals until he picks up.
00:13:25.838,00:13:27.940,But if he looks down and sees my numbers...
00:13:28.073,00:13:31.310,...he's gonna think I'm some kind of psycho or something.
00:13:31.844,00:13:33.546,Which I'm not.
00:13:33.879,00:13:35.447,Obviously.
00:13:42.288,00:13:44.156,Hello?
00:13:44.290,00:13:45.891,Mom.
00:13:46.025,00:13:47.993,I gotta call you back.
00:13:50.596,00:13:52.531,INSTRUCTOR: Inhale. Upward-facing dog.
00:13:52.865,00:13:55.134,Look up towards the ceiling.
00:13:55.267,00:13:58.103,Look up towards the ceiling.
00:13:58.470,00:14:01.040,GIGI: He ordered more drinks for us when the waitress came.
00:14:01.173,00:14:03.142,He remembered exactly what I wanted.
00:14:03.275,00:14:05.878,He initiated the hug. He said it was nice meeting me.
00:14:06.011,00:14:10.015,So wait. This was at the end of the date or the beginning of the date?
00:14:10.149,00:14:12.418,"End. Why, does it matter?"
00:14:12.551,00:14:16.021,"Yeah. Nice meeting you at the beginning of the date, that's normal."
00:14:16.155,00:14:18.357,Nice meeting you at the end of the date....
00:14:19.024,00:14:20.426,It could be a blowoff.
00:14:21.126,00:14:22.428,Maybe it was at the beginning.
00:14:22.561,00:14:25.631,Okay. That's fine. He's gonna call.
00:14:25.965,00:14:27.299,Or maybe it was at the end.
00:14:27.433,00:14:29.501,Or maybe it was just nice to meet me.
00:14:29.635,00:14:31.237,BETH: Help.
00:14:31.370,00:14:33.572,Hi. This is torture.
00:14:33.906,00:14:36.876,How am I supposed to come up with something pithy and dynamic...
00:14:37.009,00:14:38.377,...to say about cinnamon blends?
00:14:38.510,00:14:40.079,It's hard to focus on nutmeg...
00:14:40.212,00:14:42.581,...when the guy who might be the guy of my dreams...
00:14:42.915,00:14:45.150,...refuses to call me.
00:14:46.018,00:14:47.953,After my first date with Neil...
00:14:48.087,00:14:49.121,...I called him.
00:14:49.955,00:14:52.091,There are no rules anymore.
00:14:52.224,00:14:55.928,"And, I mean, why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass?"
00:15:00.332,00:15:03.402,-It's ringing. -That's pretty standard.
00:15:03.535,00:15:05.437,"-Hey, you've reached Conor. -Yes! Voicemail."
00:15:05.571,00:15:08.440,"-Leave a message, I'll get back to you. -Notes."
00:15:08.574,00:15:10.442,"Hey, Conor, it's Gigi."
00:15:10.576,00:15:12.544,"I just thought, I hadn't heard from you..."
00:15:12.678,00:15:18.083,"...and how stupid is it that a gal has to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?"
00:15:23.489,00:15:25.324,"Because we're all equal, right?"
00:15:25.457,00:15:27.359,More than equal.
00:15:27.493,00:15:30.362,More women are accepted into law school now than men.
00:15:30.496,00:15:33.032,"And, I mean, I don't know if you saw that Dateline..."
00:15:33.165,00:15:35.701,"...but women practically have penises now, right? So...."
00:15:36.969,00:15:38.003,Call me.
00:15:38.137,00:15:40.506,"Oh, this is Gigi. Call me."
00:15:43.175,00:15:46.979,"Don't worry, he's totally gonna call."
00:16:04.496,00:16:05.998,What?
00:16:06.131,00:16:09.401,How can there not be a dial tone? How can there not be a dial tone?
00:16:10.002,00:16:12.071,"No dial tone. Come here, dial tone."
00:16:13.539,00:16:15.007,"Hello, Gigi?"
00:16:15.140,00:16:16.508,"-Mom, is that you? -Yes."
00:16:16.642,00:16:29.555,"-I can't talk now, I'll call you back. -Wait, I need you to-- Hi, it's Janine. Leave a message."
00:16:29.688,00:16:31.223,"Hi, Janine, it's me."
00:16:31.357,00:16:32.458,Conor never called...
00:16:32.591,00:16:37.396,...so I'm on the precipice of staging a casual run-in at the City Supper Club.
00:16:37.529,00:16:39.431,Pick up if you wanna stop me.
00:16:40.699,00:16:44.503,"All right, I'm interpreting your silence as tacit compliance. Bye."
00:16:48.741,00:16:50.409,"BARTENDER: What's up, girl? -Hey."
00:16:50.542,00:16:52.678,-How are you? -Good.
00:16:58.717,00:16:59.785,"Knock, knock."
00:17:00.119,00:17:01.420,Hey.
00:17:02.354,00:17:03.722,So...
00:17:04.690,00:17:07.192,...here we are. Same shift again.
00:17:08.727,00:17:11.530,I know. I make the schedule. Remember?
00:17:11.663,00:17:15.200,"Well, I figured it was no coincidence."
00:17:19.471,00:17:21.206,I had...
00:17:22.074,00:17:23.442,...a good time the other night.
00:17:23.809,00:17:25.177,Yeah.
00:17:25.310,00:17:27.746,It's amazing where 10 shots of Patrón will get you.
00:17:32.451,00:17:33.585,So I was thinking...
00:17:34.253,00:17:36.789,...after work we could....
00:17:37.823,00:17:39.058,You know....
00:17:40.192,00:17:45.631,"Look, Kelli Ann, what happened between us the other night was fun."
00:17:45.764,00:17:47.099,It was definitely fun.
00:17:47.232,00:17:50.135,But we're way understaffed tonight. I even have to man the bar.
00:17:50.269,00:17:53.305,So that's why I scheduled you.
00:17:53.439,00:17:55.340,To work.
00:17:55.474,00:17:57.176,So....
00:17:59.478,00:18:01.246,Are we good?
00:18:02.614,00:18:04.650,"-Nope, we're good. -Okay."
00:18:04.783,00:18:06.151,"Hey, oh, Kelli Ann."
00:18:06.285,00:18:08.620,"Hey, babe, could you get the door? Thanks."
00:18:19.598,00:18:22.101,"KELLI ANN: Hi. Are you joining us for dinner, or...?"
00:18:22.234,00:18:23.502,I'm meeting someone. A guy.
00:18:23.635,00:18:25.204,KELLI ANN: Why? - Hm?
00:18:25.337,00:18:27.239,Nothing. Sorry. For dinner?
00:18:28.841,00:18:29.875,I'll wait at the bar.
00:18:31.510,00:18:33.145,That's a great idea.
00:18:41.453,00:18:42.754,What can I get you?
00:18:42.888,00:18:44.423,"Oh, no, I'm meeting someone."
00:18:44.556,00:18:47.292,"Oh yeah? What, you got a hot date?"
00:18:48.293,00:18:49.895,I don't know if you'd call it hot.
00:18:50.229,00:18:54.266,"This guy Conor and I have only been out one time-- Wait, wait, wait. Conor Barry?"
00:18:54.600,00:18:55.634,Yeah.
00:18:55.767,00:18:57.769,Conor's not coming in tonight. Thanks a lot.
00:18:57.903,00:19:00.572,Did he forget he was supposed to meet you here?
00:19:00.706,00:19:04.576,"Oh, see, when I said meeting someone, I guess it was kind of a broad term."
00:19:04.710,00:19:06.745,A wide interpretation of the word meeting.
00:19:06.879,00:19:09.148,Right. You know what? I'll call him.
00:19:09.281,00:19:12.417,"Oh, no. I mean, just totally unnecessary."
00:19:14.553,00:19:15.787,Okay.
00:19:15.921,00:19:17.756,I just was actually in the area...
00:19:17.890,00:19:21.326,...and so I just figured I'd swing by and see if he was around.
00:19:21.460,00:19:25.697,Because I had to return his pen.
00:19:26.231,00:19:27.900,Had to return this pen. He left this.
00:19:28.233,00:19:33.205,"And I just thought I should really return it before he, you know, freaks out."
00:19:33.939,00:19:35.707,"Yeah. Okay, I'll get it to him."
00:19:36.642,00:19:37.709,Thanks.
00:19:39.678,00:19:43.582,"Wilson Ward, DDS, Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry."
00:19:44.616,00:19:47.920,"Look, I'm not going to judge what may or may not be important to someone."
00:19:48.253,00:19:50.689,"Yeah. That's not even his dentist, though."
00:19:50.822,00:19:52.624,"Oh, really. Who is?"
00:19:53.492,00:19:55.194,My dad.
00:20:01.266,00:20:02.367,Oh.
00:20:05.571,00:20:08.807,I'm Gigi. I went out with Conor last week.
00:20:08.941,00:20:11.476,And I just....
00:20:13.278,00:20:15.948,I thought if I just ran into him....
00:20:17.849,00:20:19.918,I don't know. I'm gonna go.
00:20:20.252,00:20:21.753,Wait.
00:20:21.887,00:20:25.324,"Wait, just-- Hang out for a second. Let me buy you a drink."
00:20:25.891,00:20:28.927,One drink. Okay?
00:20:29.795,00:20:32.998,"Give me two seconds, I'll be right back."
00:20:34.600,00:20:38.804,"ALEX: Look, you seem like a cool girl, so I'm just gonna be honest with you."
00:20:38.937,00:20:41.373,Conor's never gonna call you.
00:20:41.506,00:20:43.976,"Oh, really. How do you know?"
00:20:44.309,00:20:46.745,"Because I'm a guy, and it's just how we do it."
00:20:46.878,00:20:48.447,He said it was nice meeting me.
00:20:48.580,00:20:51.016,I don't care if he said you were his favorite female...
00:20:51.350,00:20:53.619,...since his mommy and Joanie Cunningham.
00:20:53.752,00:20:56.888,"Over a week went by, okay, Gigi? And he didn't call you."
00:20:57.022,00:20:59.725,But maybe he did call and I didn't get the message.
00:20:59.858,00:21:01.393,Or maybe he lost my number...
00:21:01.526,00:21:05.564,"...or he's out of town, or got hit by a cab, or his grandma died."
00:21:05.697,00:21:08.700,Or he didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again.
00:21:10.669,00:21:14.373,Yeah. But my friend Terri once went out with a guy who never called.
00:21:14.506,00:21:15.974,She totally wrote him off.
00:21:16.308,00:21:17.843,-Over a year goes by. -Right.
00:21:17.976,00:21:22.581,"She ran into him, and it ended up that-- Your friend Terri's an idiot. She's also the exception..."
00:21:23.315,00:21:24.716,...by the way. The rare exception.
00:21:24.850,00:21:27.753,Okay. Okay. But what if I'm the exception?
00:21:27.886,00:21:30.722,"No, you're not. You're not at all. In fact, you're the rule."
00:21:30.856,00:21:35.360,"And the rule is this: If a guy doesn't call you, he doesn't wanna call you."
00:21:35.494,00:21:36.995,-Really? -Yeah.
00:21:37.329,00:21:38.997,"-Always? -Yeah, always."
00:21:39.331,00:21:43.335,"Look, I know what blowing off a woman looks like, okay?"
00:21:43.468,00:21:45.871,"I do it early, I do it often."
00:21:46.004,00:21:50.575,So trust me when I say if a guy is treating you like he doesn't give a shit...
00:21:50.709,00:21:53.312,...he genuinely doesn't give a shit.
00:21:53.445,00:21:55.347,No exceptions.
00:22:05.490,00:22:07.059,Thank you.
00:22:08.460,00:22:10.495,Given me a lot to think about.
00:22:16.835,00:22:18.770,"GIGI: Morning, morning. MAN: Excuse me."
00:22:18.904,00:22:20.038,-Hi. -Hi.
00:22:20.372,00:22:21.606,Everything okay?
00:22:21.740,00:22:22.841,"Oh, I was up all night."
00:22:22.974,00:22:25.010,Please say you were working on the nutmeg copy.
00:22:25.343,00:22:28.447,Sure. It's basically done. I have to tell you something important.
00:22:28.580,00:22:30.482,JANINE: Sweetie? What's going on with your hair?
00:22:30.615,00:22:33.885,"Yeah, come here before people see you have a mini muffin in your hair."
00:22:34.019,00:22:35.754,Okay.
00:22:35.887,00:22:37.355,So....
00:22:39.791,00:22:42.627,Thank you. I think I figured it out.
00:22:43.395,00:22:45.864,Remember that notary public who cheated on me?
00:22:45.997,00:22:49.434,Then Anastasia told me her boyfriend cheated on her at the beginning...
00:22:49.568,00:22:52.671,...but then he changed and now they're married and crazy in love?
00:22:53.371,00:22:55.674,"-I thought that guy was a process server. -No, notary."
00:22:55.807,00:22:58.777,"Anyway, my point is, Anastasia's the exception, not the rule."
00:22:58.910,00:23:00.879,We have to stop listening to these stories.
00:23:01.012,00:23:04.082,The rule is that guys who cheat on you don't care about you much.
00:23:04.950,00:23:11.556,"-Okay. -Okay, so Exhibit A: Chad, the drummer who lived in a storage space."
00:23:11.690,00:23:15.560,"He only used me for rides, and yet I continued to stalk him for most of 1998."
00:23:15.694,00:23:18.130,"And then.... Oh, there was Don..."
00:23:18.463,00:23:21.933,...who broke up with me every Friday so that he could have his weekends free.
00:23:22.067,00:23:23.969,I was delusional about that relationship.
00:23:24.102,00:23:26.705,I'd refer to him as my husband to my dental hygienist.
00:23:26.838,00:23:29.074,And all of my friends used to tell me stories...
00:23:29.407,00:23:31.910,...about how things might work out with these dipshits...
00:23:32.043,00:23:34.880,...because they knew someone who dated a dipshit like mine...
00:23:35.013,00:23:36.982,...and that girl ended up getting married.
00:23:37.115,00:23:40.185,"But that's the exception. We're not the exception, we're the rule."
00:23:45.824,00:23:49.027,"Okay, let me just see if I understand."
00:23:49.594,00:23:50.929,So what you're saying is...
00:23:51.062,00:23:54.499,...if I hear a story about a girl who's been with a guy for 13 years...
00:23:54.633,00:23:57.068,"...and he finally married her, that's the exception."
00:23:57.202,00:23:58.904,Yes.
00:23:59.037,00:24:01.940,But the rule are guys like Neil...
00:24:02.774,00:24:06.011,...who are with girls like me...
00:24:06.144,00:24:08.780,...for seven years and aren't married...
00:24:08.914,00:24:10.582,...they're never getting married.
00:24:10.916,00:24:12.450,-No. -No.
00:24:12.584,00:24:14.019,"-No, no, no. No, no, no. -No."
00:24:14.152,00:24:18.023,"-It's not what she meant in that-- -No, it's got nothing to do with you."
00:24:18.156,00:24:20.492,I absolutely was not talking about you.
00:24:20.625,00:24:24.563,-These are specific relationship situations. -I was talking about myself specifically.
00:24:24.696,00:24:27.165,"GIGI: Just me specifically, you know?"
00:24:31.736,00:24:34.472,"This guy is, like, impossible not to like, you know?"
00:24:34.606,00:24:37.809,He's flirting with me pretty heavily outside of the Handy Mart...
00:24:37.943,00:24:42.047,"...and, you know, everything just kind of lines up, it's really magical."
00:24:42.180,00:24:44.182,And then he tells me that he's married.
00:24:44.516,00:24:46.852,"Which, of course, I should be pissed about, right?"
00:24:46.985,00:24:50.021,But I just can't stop thinking about him.
00:24:50.155,00:24:51.523,But he's married.
00:24:51.656,00:24:54.993,"I know, I realize that. I don't know what's wrong with me."
00:24:55.126,00:24:56.528,What's wrong with me?
00:24:57.963,00:24:59.564,Okay.
00:24:59.698,00:25:02.534,"I know this guy, he works in my dad's printing business."
00:25:02.667,00:25:07.138,And he was married for 15 years to a nice lady.
00:25:07.272,00:25:12.043,And one night he meets this woman at some church event.
00:25:12.177,00:25:16.648,And he tells my dad that he's never felt anything like it before.
00:25:17.182,00:25:20.085,That he had finally met the one.
00:25:20.218,00:25:22.020,So he divorced his wife...
00:25:22.153,00:25:25.557,...and he's been with this other woman for 22 years...
00:25:25.690,00:25:27.959,...and they're insanely happy.
00:25:28.093,00:25:30.762,"I mean, what if you meet the love of your life..."
00:25:30.896,00:25:32.964,...but you already married someone else?
00:25:33.098,00:25:35.233,Are you supposed to let them pass you by?
00:25:37.702,00:25:41.039,You're right. Okay.
00:25:41.806,00:25:42.908,I'm gonna call him.
00:25:43.742,00:25:45.176,Okay.
00:26:00.659,00:26:03.061,"BEN: Hello? -Hey, Ben. This is Anna Marks."
00:26:03.194,00:26:05.730,"Hey, Anna. What's up?"
00:26:05.864,00:26:08.934,"Nothing, I was just-- I was taking you up on your offer."
00:26:09.067,00:26:13.605,I know you said you had a couple of contacts you thought could help me.
00:26:13.738,00:26:18.977,And I thought maybe we could talk about it over coffee or something like that.
00:26:22.113,00:26:24.316,"Look, I just...."
00:26:26.184,00:26:28.153,"I can't, Anna."
00:26:29.287,00:26:31.890,You seemed great. I just-- I don't know.
00:26:32.023,00:26:34.025,I should probably go.
00:26:34.159,00:26:35.894,"Take care, though. Bye."
00:26:43.802,00:26:44.903,-Hey. -Hey.
00:26:45.036,00:26:46.371,-I'm psyched you called. -Cool.
00:26:46.705,00:26:49.040,Kind of given up on you when you didn't call me back.
00:26:49.174,00:26:50.909,I was just thinking about you.
00:26:51.042,00:26:52.911,-Want a glass of wine? -Sure.
00:26:53.044,00:26:54.913,"Okay, what were the categories again?"
00:26:55.046,00:27:00.685,"Four categories: Smart, sexy, funny and cute."
00:27:00.819,00:27:02.954,But you can only be two things.
00:27:03.088,00:27:07.359,Like Sarah Jessica Parker would be funny and sexy.
00:27:07.692,00:27:09.661,Bill Clinton would be smart and sexy.
00:27:09.794,00:27:11.663,I can't believe you're hot for Clinton.
00:27:11.796,00:27:13.231,Go. What am I?
00:27:13.365,00:27:14.699,"Wait, what was I again?"
00:27:14.833,00:27:16.701,You're smart and cute.
00:27:16.835,00:27:19.871,"Okay, you are sexy, very sexy."
00:27:20.005,00:27:21.639,And cute.
00:27:22.374,00:27:26.411,"No, you can't-- Sexy and cute are both in the looks column."
00:27:26.745,00:27:28.346,Nobody wants to be all in one column.
00:27:28.680,00:27:32.684,"I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four, which obviously you are."
00:27:32.817,00:27:34.953,Especially sexy.
00:27:35.086,00:27:36.955,ANNA: You're the best.
00:27:41.760,00:27:43.762,I better go.
00:27:44.062,00:27:48.066,"Okay, well, you know you could stay here if you want."
00:27:48.733,00:27:50.402,What? It's been a while.
00:27:50.735,00:27:52.337,"No, I can't."
00:27:52.670,00:27:56.841,"I can't stay, I'm totally-- I'm totally, totally fried."
00:27:56.975,00:27:58.109,Is that okay?
00:27:58.243,00:27:59.811,Yeah.
00:28:04.249,00:28:05.917,I'll see you later.
00:28:06.051,00:28:07.385,Bye.
00:28:17.896,00:28:19.364,NEIL: Hey.
00:28:20.031,00:28:21.466,That look straight to you?
00:28:21.800,00:28:23.968,Why are you hanging that?
00:28:24.903,00:28:28.006,Because you asked me to about three weeks ago.
00:28:28.139,00:28:30.275,I'm getting around to it.
00:28:30.408,00:28:32.444,Why? You don't want it here?
00:28:32.777,00:28:34.345,"No, I love it there. But just stop."
00:28:35.046,00:28:37.048,Why? Is it the painting?
00:28:37.182,00:28:42.153,"You know, I know, it looks kind of like a deflated boob here."
00:28:42.287,00:28:43.755,Right? I know.
00:28:43.888,00:28:46.257,It's gonna be depressing. Should I take it down?
00:28:47.425,00:28:50.295,"No, I want you to stop doing anything nice."
00:28:52.831,00:28:54.432,This feels like a trick.
00:28:54.766,00:28:56.134,-No. -No?
00:28:56.267,00:29:00.271,"No, I just-- I just need you to stop being nice to me..."
00:29:00.405,00:29:02.407,...unless you're gonna marry me after.
00:29:04.175,00:29:06.177,Is that funny?
00:29:06.311,00:29:07.879,Do you think that's funny?
00:29:09.314,00:29:11.316,"No, I guess it's not funny."
00:29:11.449,00:29:13.384,"See, you can't keep being nice to me..."
00:29:13.518,00:29:17.288,...and I can't keep pretending that this is something that it's not.
00:29:17.789,00:29:20.859,We've been together for over seven years.
00:29:20.992,00:29:22.427,"You know me, you know who I am."
00:29:22.761,00:29:25.430,You either wanna marry me or you don't.
00:29:28.032,00:29:30.335,Or there's the possibility...
00:29:30.502,00:29:35.440,...that I mean it when I say I don't believe in marriage-- Bullshit.
00:29:35.774,00:29:36.808,Bullshit.
00:29:36.941,00:29:39.210,"Come on, it's bullshit for every woman..."
00:29:39.344,00:29:43.014,...that has been told by some man that he doesn't believe in marriage...
00:29:43.148,00:29:48.520,...and then six months later he's married to some 24-year-old that he met at a gym.
00:29:48.853,00:29:50.789,It's just-- It's bullshit.
00:29:50.922,00:29:52.290,Where is this coming from?
00:29:52.423,00:29:55.460,From the place I've been hiding from you for about five years.
00:29:55.794,00:29:56.828,Okay.
00:29:56.961,00:29:59.430,"Five years, because I haven't wanted to seem demanding."
00:29:59.564,00:30:04.235,And I haven't wanted to seem clingy or psycho.
00:30:05.036,00:30:06.504,Or whatever.
00:30:06.838,00:30:08.940,So I haven't asked you.
00:30:10.175,00:30:11.976,But I....
00:30:14.078,00:30:15.914,I have to.
00:30:17.282,00:30:19.150,I mean...
00:30:21.853,00:30:24.522,...are you ever gonna marry me?
00:30:42.907,00:30:45.276,"Oh, I can't do this anymore."
00:31:03.127,00:31:05.263,ANGELA: I used to think that I had never been dumped.
00:31:05.396,00:31:07.398,"Yeah, then we started comparing notes."
00:31:07.532,00:31:11.569,Then we realized we've both been dumped by every man we've ever been with.
00:31:11.903,00:31:13.404,-Every one. -Yeah.
00:31:13.538,00:31:16.174,-But they do it so skillfully. -Mm-hm.
00:31:16.307,00:31:19.577,They just so sneaky that you think it was your idea.
00:31:19.911,00:31:26.117,"Yeah. You're sitting back and you're like: Oh, yeah. This my idea. But wait a second, why am I alone?"
00:31:26.251,00:31:28.653,Why am I unhappy? Why have I gained 20 pounds?
00:31:28.987,00:31:31.322,"-They Jedi mind-trick you. -Yes, they do."
00:31:31.456,00:31:32.991,-So they do a soft pass. -Yeah.
00:31:33.124,00:31:35.193,They got little lines they like to tell you.
00:31:35.326,00:31:37.195,"Like, I don't wanna stand in your way."
00:31:37.328,00:31:40.665,"Or, You're perfect, it's just I have to work on myself."
00:31:40.999,00:31:43.067,Right. I'm just thinking of your happiness.
00:31:43.201,00:31:45.670,"Oh, I don't deserve you. That's my favorite one."
00:31:46.004,00:31:47.338,You know the other one I like?
00:31:47.472,00:31:50.041,I am so jealous of the guy who gets to marry you.
00:31:50.174,00:31:52.010,"-Well, that could have been you. -Yeah."
00:31:52.143,00:31:53.912,That's what I was leaning towards.
00:31:54.045,00:31:56.014,Yeah. And the second you hear that...
00:31:56.147,00:31:59.150,"...run to the store, get yourself some ribs and some ice cream..."
00:31:59.284,00:32:01.085,...because you have been dumped.
00:32:01.519,00:32:03.554,"Hey Anna, it's Ben."
00:32:03.688,00:32:06.624,"Listen, I know it's been a while since you called."
00:32:06.958,00:32:10.028,It's just-- It took me by surprise.
00:32:10.161,00:32:12.497,But I did offer to help you with your career...
00:32:12.630,00:32:14.699,"...and I don't see why I can't do that, right?"
00:32:15.033,00:32:16.501,So why don't you give me a call...
00:32:16.634,00:32:19.270,...and maybe you can come by the office or something.
00:32:19.404,00:32:22.006,"Okay? All right, take care. Bye."
00:32:22.140,00:32:23.241,"JANINE: Hey, you."
00:32:23.374,00:32:25.410,"Oh, shit."
00:32:25.543,00:32:28.513,-What? -You scared me.
00:32:28.646,00:32:30.515,-You okay? -Yeah.
00:32:30.648,00:32:32.517,Everything's fine.
00:32:32.951,00:32:34.152,Are you smoking again?
00:32:34.285,00:32:36.354,"No, sweetie, I'm not smoking."
00:32:36.487,00:32:37.522,Why?
00:32:37.655,00:32:39.257,You get jumpy when you smoke.
00:32:39.390,00:32:41.059,"I'm not smoking, I promise."
00:32:41.192,00:32:43.261,"No, I was just sitting here..."
00:32:43.394,00:32:47.131,...trying to picture what this room's gonna look like when it's finished.
00:32:47.265,00:32:48.466,-I like that game. -You do?
00:32:48.599,00:32:50.134,Yeah.
00:32:51.202,00:32:53.638,What color did you picture?
00:32:53.972,00:32:55.740,That's where I got stuck.
00:32:56.074,00:32:57.408,Yeah.
00:32:58.509,00:33:00.478,I was thinking...
00:33:01.145,00:33:03.715,...maybe yellow.
00:33:04.449,00:33:07.385,"-Yellow? Okay. -Yeah. I mean, it's neutral."
00:33:07.518,00:33:11.389,-Mm-hm. -Yeah. So it could be whatever.
00:33:11.522,00:33:15.126,"It could be an office, it could be a guest room..."
00:33:15.259,00:33:18.029,"...a gym, a baby's room...."
00:33:21.699,00:33:24.602,"Wait, did you mean neutral, or gender-neutral?"
00:33:24.736,00:33:28.406,"-I don't know what you're talking about. -Oh, really?"
00:33:30.341,00:33:33.111,I know we said we'd wait to talk about it.
00:33:33.244,00:33:35.046,BEN: Uh-huh. -Mm-hm.
00:33:35.713,00:33:41.519,But I think that we're almost ready to start talking about it.
00:33:58.036,00:34:00.471,JARRAD: So that's the last time I do anything pro bono.
00:34:03.708,00:34:06.711,"Well, ladies, I guess I have to get back to the office."
00:34:07.412,00:34:10.581,You go back to the office after happy hour? What's happy about that?
00:34:10.715,00:34:12.350,I met you.
00:34:14.619,00:34:17.221,I would love to call you sometime. Do you have a card?
00:34:19.090,00:34:20.224,"-Of course. -Oh, great."
00:34:20.358,00:34:23.494,Here is my info.
00:34:24.495,00:34:26.564,"-Nice to meet you, Janine. -Nice to meet you."
00:34:27.331,00:34:29.100,"Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi."
00:34:31.235,00:34:32.637,"Oh, wait."
00:34:34.205,00:34:35.440,So...
00:34:35.773,00:34:37.308,...how are we doing this?
00:34:37.442,00:34:40.445,Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
00:34:40.578,00:34:41.612,What?
00:34:42.213,00:34:43.748,You said you'd love to call me...
00:34:44.082,00:34:48.853,"...but then you said, Look forward to hearing from you, and-- You see how that's kind of confusing?"
00:34:49.187,00:34:52.090,"Yeah, look, we'll talk. We'll get in touch."
00:34:53.391,00:34:55.493,You did it again. Very vague.
00:34:55.626,00:34:58.362,You know what? Let's just say that you'll call me...
00:34:58.496,00:35:01.165,...and then we can skip all the nonsense.
00:35:01.299,00:35:03.201,"Goodbye, Gigi."
00:35:13.277,00:35:16.814,"-He was cute. -Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him."
00:35:19.383,00:35:20.818,What are you doing?
00:35:21.152,00:35:22.286,I'm not calling him.
00:35:22.420,00:35:24.689,"If he wants to see me, he'll call."
00:35:24.856,00:35:26.257,Wow.
00:35:26.390,00:35:29.427,That guy Alex really made an impression on you.
00:35:29.560,00:35:30.695,Was he hot?
00:35:30.828,00:35:33.464,No. He was just...
00:35:33.631,00:35:34.765,...right.
00:35:36.467,00:35:37.768,Morning.
00:35:37.902,00:35:39.570,"Morning, Ryan."
00:35:39.704,00:35:42.607,A surprise mocha venti just because you're so awesome.
00:35:42.740,00:35:45.309,-Love you. -Love you.
00:35:46.277,00:35:47.512,Good morning.
00:35:57.755,00:35:59.857,Okay.
00:36:03.594,00:36:04.595,So?
00:36:05.630,00:36:06.697,"Oh, hi."
00:36:12.370,00:36:14.539,"-He asked me out. NATHAN: Oh, my God. He called?"
00:36:15.940,00:36:18.309,MARY: Well.... -He e-mailed?
00:36:18.442,00:36:19.844,-No. BRUCE: What?
00:36:20.178,00:36:22.213,Left his calling card with your lady-in-waiting?
00:36:23.748,00:36:27.185,-He MySpaced me. -Ouch.
00:36:27.418,00:36:31.622,"-Oh. -Oh, girl, I don't know about that."
00:36:31.756,00:36:35.459,My trampy little sister says MySpace is the new booty call.
00:36:36.394,00:36:38.763,"Well, what am I supposed to do?"
00:36:38.896,00:36:40.631,"I mean, things have changed."
00:36:40.765,00:36:43.234,People don't meet each other organically anymore.
00:36:43.367,00:36:47.338,If I would like to make myself seem more attractive to the opposite sex...
00:36:47.471,00:36:50.508,"...I don't go and get a new haircut, I update my profile."
00:36:50.641,00:36:52.577,"That's just the way it is, you know?"
00:36:53.878,00:36:55.246,"NATHAN: Yeah, she's right."
00:36:55.379,00:36:57.582,"Back, back, back, back."
00:36:58.783,00:37:00.651,"Ad sales, this is Mary."
00:37:00.785,00:37:04.922,"Hi, Mary, this is Conor, Anna's friend, or whatever."
00:37:05.256,00:37:06.257,Hi.
00:37:06.591,00:37:08.993,"So, what'd you think?"
00:37:09.327,00:37:11.596,Looking at it right now. I'm not sure about this.
00:37:11.729,00:37:12.930,"Oh, you have to trust me."
00:37:13.264,00:37:15.733,"It's a burgeoning market, you're gonna make a fortune."
00:37:15.866,00:37:18.970,I know. Did you have to put me with the massage ads?
00:37:19.303,00:37:22.773,"Well, it was either that or the page with the personals, so...."
00:37:22.907,00:37:24.809,This page gets a lot of action.
00:37:24.942,00:37:26.811,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
00:37:26.944,00:37:28.679,"Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?"
00:37:28.813,00:37:30.514,Yeah.
00:37:32.416,00:37:33.951,Okay.
00:37:35.286,00:37:37.521,"All right, Mary, I'll talk to you soon. Thank you."
00:37:37.655,00:37:38.990,Bye.
00:37:39.790,00:37:42.893,PAIGE: What I'm trying to show you is that there's a difference.
00:37:43.628,00:37:44.862,There is a difference.
00:37:44.996,00:37:48.866,"BETH: Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda to sew these dresses in two weeks?"
00:37:49.000,00:37:50.401,PAIGE: She wanted to do it.
00:37:50.534,00:37:53.838,LAURA: Really? She told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.
00:37:53.971,00:37:55.773,"-Is that not right? PAIGE: No, she didn't."
00:37:55.906,00:37:56.974,LAURA: No?
00:37:57.308,00:38:01.512,BETH: What's the--? Why the big rush to get married?
00:38:01.646,00:38:05.916,PAIGE: Because I am not having my wedding during a gross Baltimore winter...
00:38:06.050,00:38:07.952,...and I am not waiting till spring.
00:38:08.286,00:38:10.288,You are so pregnant.
00:38:10.421,00:38:11.856,"PAIGE: Oh, God, I'm not pregnant."
00:38:11.989,00:38:13.958,I'm not pregnant. That's ridiculous.
00:38:14.292,00:38:16.460,"-Chug a beer then. PAIGE: No, I'm not chugging a beer."
00:38:16.594,00:38:17.595,CATHERINE: Chug a beer.
00:38:17.728,00:38:19.530,"PAIGE: We're in love, you assholes."
00:38:19.664,00:38:23.334,"That's what people do when they're in love, they get married."
00:38:26.003,00:38:29.674,"But you know what? Not everybody gets married, you know?"
00:38:29.807,00:38:33.411,There are many people who never get married.
00:38:33.811,00:38:36.047,"Well, thanks for the inspirational pep talk."
00:38:36.380,00:38:40.451,What she meant to say was that it's fine that you broke up with Neil.
00:38:40.584,00:38:41.619,Right.
00:38:41.752,00:38:44.555,Tons of people make the choice to be alone. They're happy.
00:38:45.489,00:38:47.024,Look at Al Pacino.
00:38:47.358,00:38:50.594,"Never been married, happy as a clam."
00:38:50.728,00:38:54.432,Would that--? Am I--? Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?
00:38:54.565,00:38:56.634,"No, Bethie, we just-- We want you to be happy."
00:38:56.967,00:39:00.037,"Well, then you should have rethought the coral."
00:39:00.371,00:39:02.073,"LAURA: Oh, her face."
00:39:02.406,00:39:03.774,-Your face. -Don't make her cry.
00:39:03.908,00:39:05.910,I'm sick of these coral jokes.
00:39:06.043,00:39:08.979,"I know, you're sensitive. Trust me, I get it."
00:39:09.113,00:39:12.783,"Hey, why don't you have dinner with me and Steven and the kids..."
00:39:12.917,00:39:14.552,...then you can just stay over--?
00:39:14.685,00:39:16.987,Why'd she wanna hang out with you and your husband?
00:39:17.121,00:39:18.789,The last thing I'd feel like doing.
00:39:18.923,00:39:24.695,"If being in this wedding is too painful-- Oh, God, you guys. Please, stop it. Relax, relax."
00:39:25.062,00:39:31.802,"That's enough, okay? Seriously, you guys, I'm f-- I've gone through breakups before. If you remember, I handle them quite well."
00:39:31.936,00:39:36.407,"You've been there, you've seen it. I'm perfectly capable of doing this."
00:39:36.540,00:39:38.008,I can do it again.
00:39:38.142,00:39:40.511,I want you to stop worrying about me.
00:39:40.644,00:39:42.546,I'm fine.
00:39:43.414,00:39:45.549,BEN: I know it's here somewhere.
00:39:45.683,00:39:50.721,I spoke with George Lane in Music. He had a whole list of references for you.
00:39:52.022,00:39:55.960,"Well, that's okay. You can just call me when you find it."
00:39:58.596,00:40:01.832,I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses.
00:40:01.966,00:40:03.734,I know.
00:40:03.868,00:40:05.169,"A girl can dream, though."
00:40:07.772,00:40:10.441,You're just too good a guy.
00:40:18.048,00:40:19.417,Why are you married again?
00:40:21.786,00:40:23.487,"Seriously, why?"
00:40:23.621,00:40:26.190,"No, I really think that it would be good for me to know..."
00:40:26.524,00:40:29.427,...why you cannot live without this other woman.
00:40:30.761,00:40:35.866,"Well, we'd been together since college and she gave me an ultimatum."
00:40:36.000,00:40:39.703,"She said, Either we get married or we break up."
00:40:39.837,00:40:41.138,So we got married.
00:40:42.006,00:40:44.442,Wow. You caved.
00:40:46.610,00:40:47.745,It's complicated.
00:40:48.112,00:40:49.647,Really?
00:40:51.081,00:40:55.119,What? You're a dick if you date a girl for too long and don't marry her.
00:40:55.753,00:40:58.856,You marry her and you're an asshole for marrying before you're ready.
00:40:58.989,00:41:02.526,"I mean, shit, I don't know."
00:41:15.773,00:41:17.575,You're really hot.
00:41:18.476,00:41:21.145,And I am obviously attracted to you.
00:41:23.547,00:41:25.816,So I think the best I can do is...
00:41:26.784,00:41:30.621,...eventually find this piece of paper and call you...
00:41:31.155,00:41:34.859,...and hope to just help you out in your career in some small way.
00:41:45.870,00:41:46.904,Hi.
00:41:47.037,00:41:49.139,Hi. What's going on?
00:41:58.048,00:41:59.817,Javier.
00:42:01.619,00:42:05.089,"Javier, I thought we talked about tarping the furniture."
00:42:47.264,00:42:48.299,City Supper.
00:42:48.632,00:42:50.334,"Hi, this is Gigi. Is Alex there?"
00:42:50.668,00:42:52.036,Hold on.
00:42:52.169,00:42:54.004,-Alex? -Yo.
00:42:54.138,00:42:56.106,"-Drinks are good? MAN: Yeah, one more."
00:42:56.240,00:42:58.242,"-Hello? -Hi, this is Gigi."
00:42:58.576,00:43:00.244,-Gigi? -Gigi Phillips.
00:43:00.578,00:43:03.080,"-Huh? -I, um..."
00:43:03.213,00:43:04.815,...had the dentist pen.
00:43:04.949,00:43:07.084,Right. Hey. How you doing?
00:43:07.217,00:43:10.054,-I'm really sorry to bug you. -That's okay.
00:43:10.187,00:43:13.357,You had some really good insights and I wanted to ask you a question.
00:43:13.691,00:43:16.093,"Okay, look, now I need to be harsh with you."
00:43:16.226,00:43:18.862,"Conor's never gonna be interested in you, Geege."
00:43:18.996,00:43:22.032,"No, I know. This is about Jarrad."
00:43:22.166,00:43:23.233,Jarrad.
00:43:23.367,00:43:30.374,"So we meet at happy hour and he's completely charming-- Hey, give me two seconds, okay? Two seconds, hold on."
00:43:40.784,00:43:44.321,Let me guess. He said: The only thing happy about this hour is you.
00:43:45.923,00:43:48.325,He might have used some derivative of that.
00:43:51.228,00:43:56.934,"So he says he's going to call, but then he gives me his card and he says-- Oh, he's not interested."
00:43:57.067,00:43:59.937,"-You don't even know if he's called. -Oh, did he?"
00:44:00.404,00:44:01.639,No.
00:44:02.072,00:44:05.075,-But I honestly think he's expect-- -Okay.
00:44:05.209,00:44:09.647,"Gigi, he is not interested."
00:44:10.948,00:44:12.116,"Alex, this is jacked."
00:44:12.249,00:44:15.085,The hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a black shirt.
00:44:15.219,00:44:16.720,-It's not black. -Look at it.
00:44:16.854,00:44:19.823,Not a black shirt. I see it. It's not black.
00:44:19.957,00:44:21.692,This shit is black.
00:44:24.928,00:44:28.799,"If a guy gives you his phone number instead of taking yours, he's not interested."
00:44:28.932,00:44:34.104,"He took mine first. Then he gave-- And also, if a guy wants to see you, believe me, he will see you."
00:44:36.206,00:44:40.110,I once called 55 Lauren Bells until I got the right one.
00:44:40.844,00:44:41.979,That's cute.
00:44:42.112,00:44:43.180,What happened?
00:44:43.313,00:44:46.884,"Oh, yeah, as it turns out, her ass looked really huge in the daylight."
00:44:48.752,00:44:51.722,Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women?
00:44:51.989,00:44:54.258,Don't call him. He doesn't like you.
00:44:54.825,00:44:56.393,Don't tiptoe around my feelings.
00:44:56.727,00:44:59.229,"-Well, I'm just trying to help. -I know. Thank you."
00:44:59.363,00:45:00.898,Sure.
00:45:01.031,00:45:03.867,"I gotta get back to work, but good luck."
00:45:04.001,00:45:05.836,"Okay, bye."
00:45:10.140,00:45:11.341,"Hey, buddy, you home?"
00:45:11.475,00:45:13.877,CONOR: Yeah. Come on in.
00:45:17.147,00:45:18.949,"Hey, you want a beer?"
00:45:20.451,00:45:22.786,Or an apple martini?
00:45:22.920,00:45:24.188,"Oh, that's funny."
00:45:26.156,00:45:27.958,Have you told your parents?
00:45:28.092,00:45:30.727,It's for work. I'm trying to expand my client base.
00:45:30.861,00:45:32.496,By pretending to be gay?
00:45:32.830,00:45:35.399,"No, by being more gay-friendly."
00:45:35.732,00:45:37.768,"Or, in real estate terms, gay-adjacent."
00:45:37.901,00:45:39.403,Nice. I'm gonna use that.
00:45:39.736,00:45:42.072,I should change this. It's maybe a little much.
00:45:42.206,00:45:45.876,"I don't know. Dressing like that, seeing a girl who won't sleep with you..."
00:45:46.009,00:45:47.377,...I think you can pull it off.
00:45:47.511,00:45:49.880,"It's not that she won't sleep with me, douche bag."
00:45:50.013,00:45:52.382,"I have slept with her. It's just she, you know...."
00:45:53.417,00:45:55.419,Won't sleep with you anymore.
00:45:56.019,00:45:57.921,"Pretty much, yeah."
00:45:58.388,00:46:00.057,What do you think?
00:46:00.190,00:46:01.458,I think you got a problem...
00:46:01.792,00:46:05.863,"...because you're gonna have to beat them away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man."
00:46:05.996,00:46:07.197,Holy shit.
00:46:07.798,00:46:09.967,Observe your breath.
00:46:10.767,00:46:13.437,"Inhale, belly rise."
00:46:15.205,00:46:18.876,"And exhale, belly fall."
00:46:20.144,00:46:22.880,Bring your hands together in front of your chest.
00:46:23.480,00:46:26.150,Bow your head in gratitude.
00:46:30.354,00:46:33.223,-Namaste. -Namaste.
00:46:33.357,00:46:35.425,Thank you for coming. See you next week.
00:46:39.363,00:46:40.964,Great class.
00:46:52.976,00:46:54.912,We ran into each other.
00:46:55.946,00:46:57.181,You came to my class.
00:46:58.115,00:46:59.583,I had no idea this was your class.
00:47:01.218,00:47:03.587,You called to ask me if this was my class.
00:47:03.921,00:47:05.222,"No, you never called back."
00:47:05.355,00:47:08.292,Because you told me not to call you if it was my class. It was.
00:47:08.425,00:47:10.861,-No. We just ran into each other. -Okay.
00:47:10.994,00:47:15.532,We're just two innocent folks who happen to be working out near each other.
00:47:15.866,00:47:17.834,BEN: Exactly.
00:47:19.870,00:47:21.104,Do you want a swim?
00:47:22.239,00:47:23.273,Sure.
00:47:29.880,00:47:31.615,"You know, I was just thinking..."
00:47:33.383,00:47:34.851,...why can't we be friends?
00:47:35.452,00:47:38.488,"I mean, am I not allowed to have friends anymore?"
00:47:39.022,00:47:42.893,"I mean, am I not allowed to be friends with people that are hot?"
00:47:43.026,00:47:45.596,"I mean, what kind of reverse prejudice is that?"
00:47:45.929,00:47:47.097,I hear you.
00:47:47.231,00:47:48.632,I mean...
00:47:48.966,00:47:52.302,...am I not supposed to be friends with a guy just because he's married?
00:47:52.436,00:47:53.437,Right.
00:47:53.570,00:47:55.505,Or has an insane smile?
00:47:55.639,00:47:58.141,Or an ass that makes me wanna dry hump?
00:48:03.380,00:48:06.650,-Did you just say dry hump? -Yeah.
00:48:10.354,00:48:11.655,BEN: Think I just fell in love.
00:48:18.328,00:48:20.163,So we're friends.
00:48:21.064,00:48:22.266,Yeah.
00:48:57.534,00:48:59.036,You wanna come in?
00:49:02.939,00:49:04.508,"I'm sorry, I don't trust myself."
00:49:05.208,00:49:08.045,That's okay. You can just watch.
00:49:10.514,00:49:13.483,"You know, you may be the best friend I've ever had."
00:49:24.995,00:49:27.297,-Hi. -Hey.
00:49:33.170,00:49:36.073,BEN: Take a shower. Hey. -What? Hi.
00:49:36.206,00:49:38.208,-Honey? -Yeah.
00:49:40.043,00:49:41.745,You smell weird.
00:49:42.079,00:49:44.147,"-I smell weird? -Yeah, different."
00:49:44.281,00:49:47.484,-Different how? -I don't know.
00:49:49.286,00:49:50.687,Sort of an odd thing to say.
00:49:51.021,00:49:54.291,"You know, maybe it was the ashtray and cigarettes I found."
00:49:54.424,00:49:56.360,In the back yard.
00:49:57.127,00:50:00.497,What part of My dad died of lung cancer...
00:50:00.630,00:50:03.633,...is so hard for you to wrap your brain around?
00:50:03.767,00:50:05.001,What?
00:50:05.135,00:50:08.538,"Do not lie to me, Ben. Please, okay?"
00:50:13.009,00:50:14.778,Are you serious?
00:50:18.248,00:50:23.553,"We have, like, 8000 undocumented workers here daily."
00:50:23.687,00:50:31.595,"Okay, and you find an ashtray with cigarettes in it and you think-- You automatically assume that they're mine."
00:50:31.728,00:50:33.397,"Oh, yeah."
00:50:33.530,00:50:35.599,"Honey, I'm not lying to you."
00:50:40.637,00:50:42.406,I think...
00:50:43.206,00:50:45.409,...you are really freaking out.
00:50:45.709,00:50:49.546,This whole renovation thing's getting to you because nothing's happening.
00:50:55.352,00:50:57.254,Just say no.
00:50:57.387,00:50:58.588,Get it out.
00:50:58.722,00:51:00.056,Gonna take a shower.
00:51:00.490,00:51:02.759,-I'm exhausted. -Okay.
00:51:06.363,00:51:09.633,-Sorry. -It's all right.
00:51:19.443,00:51:21.645,Who'd have thought that a random girl from yoga...
00:51:21.778,00:51:25.715,"-...would fix me up with such a good kisser? -Back at you, sister."
00:51:29.386,00:51:31.087,I can't wait to kiss you again.
00:51:31.588,00:51:33.256,But we're kissing right now.
00:51:33.390,00:51:34.524,"I know, next time."
00:51:34.658,00:51:37.427,The second-date kiss is way more intimate.
00:51:39.396,00:51:40.564,"Well, listen..."
00:51:40.697,00:51:44.301,"...I'm leaving tomorrow, so I'll be out of touch for a little bit."
00:51:46.703,00:51:49.606,Can you excuse me a quick second? Too many Diet Cokes.
00:51:50.173,00:51:51.308,Okay.
00:52:09.559,00:52:10.627,"Oh, yeah."
00:52:10.760,00:52:11.828,Yeah?
00:52:12.162,00:52:14.764,"Hey, sorry to bug you again. Quick question."
00:52:14.898,00:52:17.334,"Excuse me one minute, babe. Sorry."
00:52:17.467,00:52:19.436,What's going on?
00:52:19.569,00:52:22.572,"Okay, I'm making out with this guy-- PG stuff."
00:52:22.706,00:52:26.276,"And he mentions that he's going out of town, he's gonna be out of touch."
00:52:26.409,00:52:27.511,Run.
00:52:28.311,00:52:30.313,But maybe he is going out of town.
00:52:30.447,00:52:33.149,Where? Where's he going that he's gonna be out of touch?
00:52:35.685,00:52:37.587,Where are you going out of town to again?
00:52:37.721,00:52:39.923,Um-- Uh-- Pittsburgh.
00:52:41.558,00:52:42.692,Pittsburgh.
00:52:42.826,00:52:43.927,Run.
00:52:44.261,00:52:47.597,"So, what, now I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?"
00:52:48.298,00:52:49.833,Yeah.
00:52:50.734,00:52:53.436,There's not gonna be anybody left.
00:52:54.471,00:52:56.673,I don't know why I'm saying this...
00:52:56.806,00:52:59.676,...but I think I know a nice guy who might actually like you.
00:52:59.809,00:53:01.578,-Yeah? -Yeah.
00:53:01.711,00:53:03.780,He's friends with my brother. His name's Bill.
00:53:03.914,00:53:06.550,We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.
00:53:06.683,00:53:10.720,"So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom right now."
00:53:10.854,00:53:11.888,What do I do?
00:53:12.222,00:53:16.326,"Well, you gotta come out eventually, right? But I'd take my time in there."
00:53:16.660,00:53:18.495,I'd let him sweat.
00:53:18.628,00:53:20.864,-Thanks. -Good luck.
00:53:50.927,00:53:52.729,"BEN: Yeah, the boat looks great."
00:53:52.862,00:53:54.497,You look like shit.
00:53:54.631,00:53:56.533,But your boat looks great.
00:53:56.666,00:54:00.537,"Yeah. I live on my boat, man."
00:54:00.670,00:54:02.772,Personal hygiene goes out the window.
00:54:02.906,00:54:05.308,A lot of time to work on the place.
00:54:05.442,00:54:07.310,BEN: You should try working on a shower.
00:54:07.444,00:54:08.945,NEIL: Yeah.
00:54:09.412,00:54:12.415,"Hey, what can I tell you?"
00:54:12.549,00:54:16.519,"Standing on principle, man. It's all I got."
00:54:20.624,00:54:22.025,Cigarette?
00:54:22.359,00:54:23.526,"No, I'm good."
00:54:23.660,00:54:25.929,"That's right, you quit."
00:54:27.030,00:54:28.632,Good for you.
00:54:34.704,00:54:38.842,BEN: So did Janine send you out here to check up on me?
00:54:39.542,00:54:41.378,"Yeah, pretty much."
00:54:41.511,00:54:43.413,What are you gonna tell her?
00:54:44.047,00:54:47.417,I'll tell her how gorgeous you look out here on the ocean.
00:54:48.685,00:54:50.687,Break.
00:54:50.820,00:54:52.656,Any word from Beth?
00:54:54.057,00:54:58.828,"She's so busy organizing her sister's funeral, I think she must be-- Sister's what?"
00:54:58.962,00:55:00.964,Her wedding. Her sister's wedding.
00:55:01.297,00:55:03.800,-Isn't that what I said? -No. You said funeral.
00:55:03.933,00:55:05.602,"-No, I didn't. -Yes, you did."
00:55:05.735,00:55:07.437,"Shit, did I really?"
00:55:07.570,00:55:09.739,That's so weird.
00:55:10.073,00:55:12.475,I don't understand why people wanna get married.
00:55:14.511,00:55:15.578,They don't.
00:55:15.712,00:55:17.347,-They don't? -No.
00:55:17.747,00:55:20.750,"No, no guy actually wants to get married."
00:55:20.884,00:55:24.054,"And if they do, all they're really thinking about?"
00:55:24.387,00:55:26.556,All the women they're gonna miss out on.
00:55:26.690,00:55:28.858,"I don't wanna be with anybody else, just Beth."
00:55:30.760,00:55:32.629,"I don't know, man, I...."
00:55:32.762,00:55:34.497,Why'd you get married?
00:55:36.700,00:55:38.635,I love Janine.
00:55:38.768,00:55:40.470,You're a happily married guy.
00:55:41.071,00:55:42.839,Yeah.
00:55:42.972,00:55:45.008,"Yeah, I'd say so."
00:55:51.614,00:55:53.750,"Now, I know I don't need to tell any of you..."
00:55:53.883,00:55:57.620,...that my cousin Paige is hot.
00:55:59.522,00:56:02.692,"In high school, if I told the popular guys that Paige was my cousin..."
00:56:02.826,00:56:04.894,...it'd keep me from getting my ass kicked...
00:56:05.028,00:56:07.797,...because no one wanted to blow their chances with her.
00:56:09.466,00:56:14.003,And when she gets up there and says those marriage vows to Devon...
00:56:14.137,00:56:16.906,...there will be hearts breaking all over the world.
00:56:17.040,00:56:18.942,"MAN: Hear, hear. WOMAN: That's sweet."
00:56:20.477,00:56:25.782,"But, you know, keep in mind that her sister Beth is still on the market."
00:56:26.916,00:56:29.686,"Yeah, sure, she may be an older model..."
00:56:29.819,00:56:32.622,...but she got a lot of good miles left in that tank.
00:56:32.756,00:56:34.557,But don't stay on the lot too long...
00:56:34.691,00:56:39.763,"...or next year's models are gonna slip in there and steal all-- Okay, that's enough of the speeches."
00:56:39.896,00:56:40.930,Okay.
00:56:41.064,00:56:42.966,KEN: So enjoy the crab.
00:56:43.099,00:56:48.905,"And that yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the crab's hepatopancreas."
00:56:52.609,00:56:53.843,Bethie.
00:56:55.145,00:56:58.014,Your cousin Jay has always been a jackass.
00:56:58.148,00:56:59.182,I know.
00:56:59.749,00:57:01.985,And somehow even he's married.
00:57:03.586,00:57:05.855,"Oh, honey, look."
00:57:05.989,00:57:09.559,Back when everyone was just going to camp at the Y...
00:57:09.692,00:57:11.694,...you borrowed my New York Times...
00:57:11.828,00:57:14.130,...found some arts camp in the Berkshires...
00:57:14.464,00:57:17.600,...wrote away for information and got accepted on your own.
00:57:17.734,00:57:20.470,You never did things like everyone else.
00:57:20.603,00:57:21.838,Why not?
00:57:21.971,00:57:23.606,Because that's you.
00:57:24.007,00:57:26.876,That's why you're my favorite daughter.
00:57:27.577,00:57:29.946,You're not supposed to say that.
00:57:30.079,00:57:31.948,I don't give a shit.
00:57:32.081,00:57:34.717,"I'm retired, I'll say what I want to."
00:57:34.851,00:57:36.853,I'll say it to the whole room if you want.
00:57:36.986,00:57:39.789,"Wait, wait, wait! Come here. Stop."
00:57:39.923,00:57:41.825,"KEN: It's true, though."
00:57:59.075,00:58:00.109,Hey.
00:58:01.978,00:58:04.180,-What are you doing? -Waiting for you.
00:58:07.984,00:58:09.853,Come on.
00:58:14.123,00:58:15.191,Sorry I'm late.
00:58:15.525,00:58:16.793,"No, it's okay."
00:58:16.926,00:58:18.862,I like a little time before a blind date.
00:58:18.995,00:58:22.765,"Prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars...."
00:58:22.899,00:58:24.067,"Gigi, he's not coming."
00:58:24.200,00:58:27.570,But you can tell me the story about the molars. I'd love to hear it.
00:58:27.704,00:58:29.539,Hey.
00:58:29.672,00:58:31.207,How could he already not like me?
00:58:31.541,00:58:34.744,"I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday, not Tuesday. It's my fault."
00:58:34.878,00:58:36.212,Hi. Are you good?
00:58:36.546,00:58:38.615,-Can I get a Jameson on the rocks? -Sure.
00:58:41.217,00:58:44.787,GIGI: Awesome. I'm stuck with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.
00:58:44.921,00:58:48.992,"Meanwhile, this girl, she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak."
00:58:49.125,00:58:50.693,-This one right here? -Mm-hm.
00:58:50.827,00:58:52.228,"Oh, God, no."
00:58:52.962,00:58:54.731,How do you know?
00:58:55.565,00:58:57.300,The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?
00:58:57.634,00:58:59.903,"She's interested, he's clearly not."
00:59:00.036,00:59:03.039,You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not into her.
00:59:03.172,00:59:05.909,"Actually, I can. I see this stuff going on every night."
00:59:06.042,00:59:08.711,Watch this. She's going on about her macrobiotic diet.
00:59:08.845,00:59:11.047,"He's thinking, Dear Christ, get me out of here."
00:59:11.180,00:59:12.715,"And look, how fortuitous."
00:59:12.849,00:59:15.585,"Drinks spill, which is perfect for him, because now...."
00:59:15.718,00:59:17.921,He can move on to the girl with the shoulder tattoo.
00:59:19.155,00:59:20.990,"Man, you have a gift."
00:59:21.124,00:59:23.226,Now check out Droopy Dog on the other side.
00:59:23.560,00:59:27.597,He's gonna buy her drinks all night and she's still gonna insist there's no spark.
00:59:27.730,00:59:29.832,Maybe there's not. You need a spark.
00:59:29.966,00:59:32.835,"Oh, the spark thing is bullshit."
00:59:32.969,00:59:34.637,-Really? -Bullshit.
00:59:34.771,00:59:36.039,Enlighten me.
00:59:36.172,00:59:37.907,Guys invented the spark...
00:59:38.041,00:59:41.911,...so they could not call and treat you kind of badly and keep you guessing...
00:59:42.045,00:59:45.848,...then convince you that that anxiety and fear that just develops naturally...
00:59:45.982,00:59:47.650,...was actually just a spark.
00:59:47.784,00:59:50.954,And you guys all buy it. You eat it up and you love it.
00:59:51.087,00:59:54.257,You love it because you feed off that drama. You all love that drama.
00:59:54.591,00:59:55.625,I don't.
00:59:55.758,00:59:59.028,So you never wait until the last minute on a deadline or a phone bill...
00:59:59.162,01:00:01.064,...because secretly you love the drama...
01:00:01.197,01:00:03.766,...of not knowing whether or not you're gonna make it?
01:00:04.734,01:00:06.035,Maybe.
01:00:06.169,01:00:10.173,And let me guess: When you were stalking Conor the other night...
01:00:10.306,01:00:12.642,...were you obsessing about him calling...
01:00:12.775,01:00:15.945,"...constantly pacing back and forth, staring at your phone for days..."
01:00:16.079,01:00:18.681,...even though the date was just kind of mediocre?
01:00:20.717,01:00:22.685,Okay. Yeah.
01:00:22.819,01:00:25.355,Because you all thrive on the drama. Thank you.
01:00:25.688,01:00:28.358,"Look, you gotta be more like me. If a girl likes me, great."
01:00:28.691,01:00:31.861,"But if not, there are plenty more out there like her, you know?"
01:00:31.995,01:00:34.030,With smaller pores and bigger implants.
01:00:34.397,01:00:37.033,-That's beautiful. -I know.
01:00:37.166,01:00:40.870,Why are you sharing all of this inside dating information with me again?
01:00:41.004,01:00:42.872,"I don't know, I like you."
01:00:44.107,01:00:45.141,You do?
01:00:47.210,01:00:50.880,"Well, yeah. Okay, don't start doodling my name on your binder, okay?"
01:00:51.014,01:00:55.051,"I just mean-- I mean, I like you the way I like basset hounds."
01:00:55.184,01:00:58.021,Something pathetic about them. You just wanna cheer them up.
01:00:58.154,01:01:00.189,Again with the sensitivity.
01:01:00.857,01:01:02.358,To sensitivity.
01:01:09.966,01:01:11.768,It looks good.
01:01:11.901,01:01:13.236,JAVIER: Yeah.
01:01:13.369,01:01:15.004,JANINE: Yeah.
01:01:15.905,01:01:18.708,"-He does good work. -Yeah, he does."
01:01:20.743,01:01:22.345,JANINE: Very nice.
01:01:26.282,01:01:28.117,Very nice.
01:01:30.987,01:01:33.456,-Javier? -Yeah.
01:01:35.224,01:01:36.759,Javier...
01:01:37.293,01:01:40.129,...if I asked you an honest question...
01:01:40.263,01:01:42.799,...do you think you could give me an honest answer?
01:01:42.932,01:01:45.902,"-I think so. -Good, good."
01:01:46.335,01:01:50.273,Because I think some of your guys might be smoking.
01:01:51.274,01:01:52.875,Javier?
01:01:53.009,01:01:54.844,-Is that the question? -Yes.
01:01:54.977,01:01:57.413,-Seemed like a statement. -The question part's implied.
01:01:57.747,01:02:00.116,I really didn't hear it in the inflection.
01:02:00.249,01:02:01.718,Javier...
01:02:02.385,01:02:04.153,...have you guys been smoking...
01:02:04.754,01:02:06.089,...or not?
01:02:07.890,01:02:11.427,"No, ma'am. My guys, they don't smoke on the job site. They're good guys."
01:02:12.028,01:02:14.163,Are you sure your guys haven't been...
01:02:14.297,01:02:16.766,...sneaking around here?
01:02:16.899,01:02:17.967,And smoking?
01:02:19.001,01:02:21.104,And lying to me?
01:02:21.237,01:02:22.438,And smoking?
01:02:22.772,01:02:23.840,I'm pretty sure.
01:02:23.973,01:02:26.309,"I need you to be honest with me, Javier."
01:02:26.442,01:02:28.945,Because I can't have someone lying to me.
01:02:29.078,01:02:32.448,"To my face, under my roof, on my time."
01:02:33.116,01:02:34.383,That's a lot of prepositions.
01:02:34.517,01:02:39.255,"I mean, there's no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there?"
01:02:39.388,01:02:42.859,"I mean, we made promises to each other."
01:02:44.060,01:02:46.129,"I mean, we have a contract."
01:02:46.262,01:02:49.265,That's like making promises. Isn't it?
01:02:51.434,01:02:53.202,Maybe I should get back to work.
01:02:55.772,01:02:57.807,"Oh, yeah. Right, yeah."
01:02:57.940,01:03:00.209,"That's great, yeah."
01:03:00.343,01:03:03.079,-Javier? -Yeah.
01:03:04.046,01:03:06.482,We're good. Right? You and me.
01:03:07.350,01:03:09.819,"-Oh, yeah, yeah. We're good. -Oh, good."
01:03:10.253,01:03:11.821,"Okay, that's great."
01:03:11.954,01:03:13.956,"Yeah, he did great work."
01:03:19.262,01:03:20.830,Hey.
01:03:22.098,01:03:24.934,"Welcome, everybody. Thanks for coming. I'm Conor."
01:03:25.067,01:03:27.503,Sign in when you get a second. Make yourselves at home.
01:03:27.837,01:03:30.973,"We got some cookies over here, some cold beverages. Help yourself."
01:03:31.107,01:03:33.576,"Conor, you are the Liza Minnelli of real estate."
01:03:33.910,01:03:37.513,"-I know. Your friend Mary's a genius. -I know, she's so great."
01:03:38.848,01:03:42.251,"Well, I gotta go, so I guess I'll see you later."
01:03:42.385,01:03:43.853,"What, you got a class, or...?"
01:03:43.986,01:03:47.256,"Yeah. No. No, just something."
01:03:47.390,01:03:49.959,-Stuff I gotta do. CONOR: Okay. Well....
01:03:50.092,01:03:53.062,-I'll see you. Okay. Bye. -Okay.
01:03:53.196,01:03:55.398,Okay. Bye.
01:03:55.531,01:03:57.466,-See you later. CONOR: All right. Call me.
01:04:01.971,01:04:03.005,What?
01:04:04.207,01:04:06.843,"She's holding out on you, isn't she?"
01:04:08.511,01:04:10.479,Not quite sure I get your meaning.
01:04:10.613,01:04:12.882,It's obvious she won't sleep with you.
01:04:13.316,01:04:16.352,It's written all over your puppy-dog face.
01:04:18.020,01:04:20.990,"-It's killing me, literally. I'm dying. -Here, have a cookie."
01:04:21.123,01:04:22.458,"No, I'm cool."
01:04:22.592,01:04:25.328,I don't know what she's doing. I cannot read her signals.
01:04:25.461,01:04:27.363,We used to sleep together all the time.
01:04:30.299,01:04:32.435,That's not true. I don't know why I said that.
01:04:32.568,01:04:36.172,"It wasn't all the time, but it happened. I know I'm not just making this up."
01:04:36.305,01:04:39.175,And then out of nowhere it just stops. But she still calls.
01:04:39.308,01:04:42.445,She wants a massage. She leaves cute messages.
01:04:42.578,01:04:45.181,But it's not going anywhere. What is she doing?
01:04:45.314,01:04:48.284,"Honestly, we may not have the best insight."
01:04:48.417,01:04:51.387,Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals.
01:04:51.520,01:04:54.323,He's right. The signals are totally different.
01:04:54.457,01:04:58.261,"Like, here. Here's I wanna sleep with you."
01:04:58.628,01:05:01.931,"One, two, three."
01:05:02.064,01:05:04.333,"That's it, three seconds or more, it's on."
01:05:04.467,01:05:07.203,And here's I don't wanna sleep with you.
01:05:07.336,01:05:08.938,"One, two...."
01:05:09.071,01:05:11.607,"-Nope, thanks for playing, move along. -It's that simple."
01:05:13.109,01:05:15.044,"You're right, that didn't help me at all."
01:05:15.177,01:05:20.216,"All right, well, I can tell you this: Gay or straight, you're not gonna get anywhere by being inactive."
01:05:20.349,01:05:23.586,She likes you. Maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something.
01:05:26.289,01:05:28.958,"Hit me up with an oatmeal raisin, will you?"
01:05:29.091,01:05:31.427,-Thanks. -Here you go.
01:05:34.964,01:05:36.933,"TRENT: If a girl's into you, she's sleeping with you."
01:05:37.600,01:05:40.436,"If after a month, or two months at the very outside..."
01:05:40.569,01:05:42.638,...she's not sleeping with you?
01:05:43.339,01:05:45.241,She doesn't like you.
01:05:45.608,01:05:47.443,The trick is to spot this girl early.
01:05:47.576,01:05:51.514,Don't wanna waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out it's never gonna happen.
01:05:51.647,01:05:55.518,So I've come up with some signs about how to spot this girl.
01:05:56.686,01:05:59.121,A girl will never sleep with you...
01:05:59.255,01:06:02.325,...if she calls you cuddly or dependable.
01:06:02.591,01:06:04.593,If she pops a zit in front of you...
01:06:05.227,01:06:08.364,...if her name is Amber or Christine...
01:06:08.664,01:06:10.666,...if she takes a dump in your bathroom...
01:06:11.000,01:06:14.470,"...or she takes home leftovers on dates one, two, or three."
01:06:14.603,01:06:17.173,I know it's not scientific...
01:06:17.306,01:06:19.542,"...but I'm just saying, you were warned."
01:06:41.697,01:06:42.698,"Wait, stop."
01:06:46.135,01:06:47.169,What?
01:06:47.703,01:06:49.505,BEN: Shit.
01:06:50.339,01:06:51.374,What?
01:06:53.743,01:06:55.411,I am so into you.
01:06:56.379,01:06:58.447,"Seriously, I've never felt like this before."
01:06:58.714,01:07:02.318,I have to actively stop my brain from thinking about you.
01:07:02.718,01:07:05.054,"Like, all the time."
01:07:08.457,01:07:09.792,Why stop?
01:07:13.095,01:07:15.131,Because I don't do stuff like this.
01:07:15.264,01:07:17.166,Stuff like what?
01:07:19.068,01:07:20.803,Like sleep with women that aren't my wife.
01:07:21.537,01:07:25.474,"First of all, I am not women, I'm just one."
01:07:26.208,01:07:27.476,And second of all?
01:07:29.245,01:07:30.746,"Oh, I didn't have a second of all."
01:07:31.080,01:07:33.716,I was hoping second of all would make me feel better.
01:07:38.454,01:07:40.456,Second of all...
01:07:41.424,01:07:44.493,...I can't stop thinking about you either.
01:07:57.139,01:08:00.376,He's totally leaving his wife for me. That's crazy.
01:08:00.509,01:08:02.578,That's crazy. We hardly know each other.
01:08:02.711,01:08:04.780,"I don't know. I mean, look at Becca."
01:08:05.114,01:08:06.615,"You know, my sister's friend."
01:08:06.749,01:08:08.517,One guy waits on her at Bennigan's...
01:08:08.651,01:08:12.121,"...and by the end of the meal, they both knew they had found the one."
01:08:13.155,01:08:16.625,"You're right. You're totally right. I mean, it could happen, right?"
01:08:17.193,01:08:19.095,Not for me.
01:08:19.462,01:08:20.796,What about texter?
01:08:21.130,01:08:23.666,Texter has yet to make verbal contact.
01:08:23.799,01:08:27.803,"I mean, this guy could've had surgery, leaving him without a voice box..."
01:08:28.137,01:08:29.505,...breathing through a stoma...
01:08:29.638,01:08:33.209,...and I would never know because I've never actually heard his voice.
01:08:33.342,01:08:35.277,"Well, I doubt he has a stoma."
01:08:35.411,01:08:38.481,MARY: That's not the point. I can't text.
01:08:38.614,01:08:40.749,"You know, I'm not charming via text."
01:08:40.883,01:08:42.585,ANNA: Maybe you should just stop texting.
01:08:42.718,01:08:47.690,"But it's not just texting, it's e-mail. It's voicemail. It's snail mail."
01:08:47.823,01:08:49.125,That's regular mail.
01:08:49.258,01:08:50.826,Whatever. None of it's working.
01:08:51.160,01:08:56.165,"I had this guy leave me a voicemail at work, so I called him at home."
01:08:56.298,01:09:00.669,"And then he e-mailed me to my BlackBerry, and so I texted to his cell."
01:09:00.803,01:09:05.741,Then he e-mailed me to my home account and the whole thing just got out of control.
01:09:05.875,01:09:11.313,And I miss the days where you had one phone number and one answering machine.
01:09:11.447,01:09:14.250,And that one answering machine housed one cassette tape...
01:09:14.383,01:09:17.920,...and that one cassette tape either had a message from the guy or it didn't.
01:09:18.254,01:09:21.423,And now you have to go around checking all these different portals...
01:09:21.557,01:09:24.593,...just to get rejected by seven different technologies.
01:09:24.727,01:09:26.595,It's exhausting.
01:09:27.196,01:09:29.331,What about that MySpace guy?
01:09:29.465,01:09:31.901,-Jude. I like him. -Good.
01:09:32.601,01:09:35.171,"Yeah, I felt like we connected."
01:09:35.304,01:09:36.539,Great.
01:09:36.739,01:09:39.575,What if she wants you to kiss her?
01:09:39.708,01:09:43.479,"Well, then I guess I'm just gonna have to kiss her."
01:09:43.612,01:09:45.414,Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer...
01:09:45.548,01:09:48.584,...who'll be swept off her feet at the touch of your amateur lips.
01:09:49.952,01:09:51.887,This babe has plenty of battle scars.
01:09:52.454,01:09:53.489,Hello?
01:09:54.723,01:09:56.225,"Oh, hey, you're home."
01:09:57.359,01:09:58.627,Where am I supposed to be?
01:09:59.395,01:10:01.697,"Out, maybe? It's Saturday night."
01:10:02.231,01:10:05.634,You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me. It's kind of limiting.
01:10:05.768,01:10:07.970,"Right. Listen, I was just gonna leave a message."
01:10:08.304,01:10:10.706,I'm having a party next weekend. You should come.
01:10:11.507,01:10:15.444,"Oh, I don't know. Won't Conor be there? Might be kind of awkward."
01:10:15.578,01:10:19.515,He's at a real-estate conference in D.C. But there'll be a lot of single guys.
01:10:19.648,01:10:22.318,So there will be plenty of chances for me to be awkward.
01:10:22.451,01:10:24.853,"Don't worry, I'll be there. I'll talk you through it."
01:10:26.322,01:10:27.389,"Okay, gotta go."
01:10:27.523,01:10:30.593,"Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates. Maybe I'll see you there."
01:10:30.726,01:10:33.262,You're busy. I shouldn't have called. You called me.
01:10:33.395,01:10:35.464,"-Yup, good. -Bye."
01:10:42.638,01:10:45.341,"Pretend I'm a girl, okay?"
01:10:46.508,01:10:47.910,I mean...
01:10:48.510,01:10:49.678,...pretend I'm her.
01:10:50.579,01:10:52.314,Amanda.
01:10:55.517,01:10:56.719,He's into me.
01:10:56.852,01:10:58.988,Awesome. I knew it.
01:10:59.321,01:11:01.290,-Who's this now? -Alex.
01:11:01.423,01:11:04.627,It's totally clear to me now. He's Watts.
01:11:04.760,01:11:07.896,-He's what? -From Some Kind of Wonderful.
01:11:08.030,01:11:10.266,I thought Mary Stuart Masterson was Watts.
01:11:10.399,01:11:12.568,-Yes. -So why aren't you Watts?
01:11:13.269,01:11:14.703,I'm Eric Stoltz.
01:11:16.005,01:11:19.441,Alex is Watts. Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones.
01:11:19.575,01:11:21.443,"Really, she's in love with Eric Stoltz."
01:11:21.977,01:11:24.313,So Amanda Jones is Conor?
01:11:25.014,01:11:28.917,"I guess. At first. Now men in general, but that's not the point."
01:11:29.051,01:11:30.953,The point is he's into me.
01:11:31.287,01:11:34.657,I knew there had to be some reason why he was spending that time with you.
01:11:34.790,01:11:38.460,I know. It's so obvious now. There are so many signs.
01:11:38.594,01:11:41.964,Signs. Love signs. You gotta tell me about the signs. I love signs.
01:11:42.298,01:11:46.035,"First they were small. At first when I called, he said, Good to hear from you."
01:11:46.368,01:11:47.736,-Totally good sign. -Right?
01:11:47.870,01:11:50.572,And then the next time I called he was with a woman...
01:11:50.706,01:11:53.475,...but he took the call and we talked for a while.
01:11:53.609,01:11:55.644,-You know it was a woman? -Called her babe.
01:11:55.778,01:11:59.748,"Okay, a guy doesn't leave a woman to go talk to another woman unless he's...."
01:11:59.882,01:12:01.350,And it gets more obvious.
01:12:01.483,01:12:05.487,"I mean, please. There was no guy he was gonna fix me up with."
01:12:05.621,01:12:06.989,The fix-up was him.
01:12:07.323,01:12:08.424,No.
01:12:08.557,01:12:12.494,Yes. He shows up without this fictitious Bill character.
01:12:12.628,01:12:14.430,The two of us basically have a date.
01:12:14.563,01:12:19.501,And then he calls and invites me to a party at his place.
01:12:19.635,01:12:21.970,JANINE: He so likes you.
01:12:23.005,01:12:25.774,I'm so happy for you.
01:12:25.908,01:12:28.844,Let's look up places for your destination wedding.
01:12:31.847,01:12:34.917,How do you feel about Napa Valley?
01:12:35.050,01:12:37.386,I have really always wanted to go there.
01:12:40.489,01:12:41.990,"Oh, he's cute."
01:12:42.124,01:12:44.660,Yeah. Smoldering but sensitive.
01:12:45.494,01:12:49.765,"Oh. All I have is my guitar, these chords, and the truth."
01:12:49.898,01:12:51.066,BOTH: Bon Jovi.
01:12:51.400,01:12:53.702,-That's hot. -Yeah. I like him.
01:12:53.836,01:12:57.906,"I mean, he probably hasn't called yet because we just had coffee last night."
01:12:58.540,01:13:00.376,"-Really? MARY: Yeah, you know."
01:13:00.509,01:13:03.679,"I mean, we actually video iChatted while holding coffee."
01:13:03.812,01:13:05.547,"But that's the same thing, right?"
01:13:05.681,01:13:07.816,"-Right, right. -Just call your voicemail."
01:13:07.950,01:13:11.820,"Yeah, but he had a gig last night and he probably didn't get home till late."
01:13:11.954,01:13:13.956,-Did I tell you he's a singer? -Mm-hm.
01:13:14.089,01:13:15.891,"-Just call. JOSHUA: Oh, honey, no, on speaker."
01:13:16.558,01:13:18.827,I don't think so. I'm sure he hasn't called.
01:13:18.961,01:13:20.562,-Just call him. -Okay.
01:13:26.168,01:13:29.738,RECORDING: You have two new messages. GUYS: Oh.

01:13:43.519,01:13:44.920,"Hey, Mary, it's Jude."
01:13:45.053,01:13:48.991,I was just calling to tell you again how special it was to meet you.
01:13:49.124,01:13:52.795,So call me back. Bye-bye.
01:13:54.797,01:13:55.931,Amazing.
01:13:56.532,01:13:58.634,"NATHAN: This is good, this is good. -This is...."
01:13:58.767,01:13:59.968,"See, he called."
01:14:02.004,01:14:13.615,"Whoa, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny Hey, Jenny, it's Jude. I was just calling to-- Whoa, shit. What number did I just dial?"
01:14:13.749,01:14:16.752,RECORDING: All messages erased.
01:14:28.130,01:14:29.164,That one.
01:14:29.498,01:14:30.566,-You sure? -Yeah.
01:14:32.000,01:14:34.036,No. It's a laminate.
01:14:35.037,01:14:37.606,-That's not real hardwood floor? -Nope.
01:14:37.739,01:14:41.143,It looks exactly like it. But it is like one one-hundredth of the cost.
01:14:41.477,01:14:42.644,Oh.
01:14:44.079,01:14:45.914,I still wanna go with the real wood.
01:14:46.748,01:14:48.984,What? You can't even tell the difference.
01:14:49.117,01:14:50.919,It's not the point.
01:14:51.920,01:14:53.188,"Well, what is the point?"
01:14:53.522,01:14:55.090,I just....
01:14:55.657,01:14:58.227,I don't like the way it's pretending to be wood.
01:14:58.560,01:15:01.063,"If you're not wood, don't try and look like wood."
01:15:01.864,01:15:03.932,I don't think that it's pretending.
01:15:05.067,01:15:06.802,"This is a lie, Ben."
01:15:06.935,01:15:10.672,Just be up front and tell people what you really are.
01:15:12.241,01:15:14.610,"Okay, you're right. You're right."
01:15:14.743,01:15:16.245,I'm sorry.
01:15:19.147,01:15:22.818,It's okay. Maybe we should just go look at the grills and we'll come back.
01:15:23.752,01:15:24.786,Okay.
01:15:29.224,01:15:31.193,I slept with someone.
01:15:39.835,01:15:41.970,-I said-- -I heard you.
01:15:46.241,01:15:49.611,You tell me this in Home Depot because you know I hate a public scene.
01:15:49.745,01:15:54.583,"No, that is not why I'm telling-- I knew it."
01:15:55.317,01:15:56.552,I knew it.
01:15:56.685,01:15:58.587,-You asshole. -I'm sorry.
01:16:00.589,01:16:03.559,"It is you that's been smoking too, isn't it?"
01:16:04.026,01:16:06.595,"Wha--? Wait, what does that even matter?"
01:16:06.728,01:16:08.297,Have you--?!
01:16:09.798,01:16:11.233,Have you been smoking?
01:16:11.567,01:16:12.834,"No. No, I haven't."
01:16:20.042,01:16:21.276,I talked to Neil. I told him.
01:16:21.610,01:16:23.278,He said I could stay at his boat for a while.
01:16:23.612,01:16:24.846,Excuse me?
01:16:25.948,01:16:28.016,Now you're moving out?
01:16:28.150,01:16:30.085,"-You're, like, leaving me? -No."
01:16:30.218,01:16:38.160,"No, I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to-- Aren't we gonna deal with this?"
01:16:38.293,01:16:42.297,Don't you wanna find some way...
01:16:42.631,01:16:45.133,...for us to work through this?
01:16:45.734,01:16:49.638,"I assumed that when I told you, you would want me..."
01:16:50.372,01:16:51.607,...out.
01:16:54.176,01:16:55.978,Is that what you want?
01:17:09.191,01:17:10.626,No.
01:17:12.961,01:17:14.262,Okay.
01:17:14.796,01:17:16.164,Okay.
01:17:39.221,01:17:41.823,WOMAN 1: You're doing a great job.
01:17:48.830,01:17:51.700,"Oh, my gosh, it's Bridget. Hi!"
01:17:55.303,01:17:57.205,"WOMAN 2: Oh, my goodness."
01:18:00.676,01:18:02.978,"Oh, what a beautiful dog."
01:18:12.454,01:18:16.458,"Seriously, Devon, I really did feel just a moment, a splash, of hesitation."
01:18:16.792,01:18:19.061,"No, there wasn't. There wasn't any hesitation at all."
01:18:19.194,01:18:21.263,PAIGE: You just did it again. That was a pause.
01:18:21.396,01:18:23.799,DEVON: I did not pause.
01:18:30.138,01:18:32.040,You must be Beth.
01:18:34.409,01:18:36.445,Yeah. Yeah.
01:18:36.778,01:18:39.014,Heard a lot about you from Paige.
01:18:39.481,01:18:43.385,Actually been lobbying to sit next to her single sister for weeks.
01:18:44.019,01:18:45.954,"Oh, yeah?"
01:18:46.088,01:18:50.292,So you must be: Dan.
01:18:50.926,01:18:52.294,Sort of.
01:18:53.261,01:18:56.465,"-Sort of? -Well, I'm actually a Wiccan."
01:18:56.798,01:18:58.366,-A what? -A Wiccan.
01:18:59.167,01:19:00.168,Wiccan?
01:19:00.302,01:19:01.970,-Male witch. -Right. Oh.
01:19:02.104,01:19:04.773,So I also have a magical name.
01:19:05.040,01:19:07.309,It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.
01:19:07.442,01:19:10.912,But I didn't know if that would fit on the card. Love that.
01:19:11.046,01:19:13.782,I'm guessing that I'm gonna hear a whole lot about you.
01:19:13.915,01:19:16.318,"Nature-based pre-Christian paganism, yeah."
01:19:16.451,01:19:18.453,Yeah. That's fantastic.
01:19:18.787,01:19:20.122,"Well, where to begin?"
01:19:20.255,01:19:23.258,"Well, first off, it's not just a bunch of nude farming. Dad."
01:19:23.391,01:19:25.460,Let's look at Stonehenge.
01:19:25.794,01:19:27.028,Obviously not a coincidence.
01:19:27.162,01:19:30.165,They didn't have the machinery to move those rocks. They're huge.
01:19:30.298,01:19:32.067,"-Yeah, they're heavy. -Of course."
01:20:01.363,01:20:04.366,-I'm Nathan. And this is Bruce. -Gigi.
01:20:05.433,01:20:07.102,-Gigi. Hi. -Hey.
01:20:08.103,01:20:11.439,So how do you guys know Alex?
01:20:12.841,01:20:16.378,We don't. Our friend Mary heard about this from some guy named Conor.
01:20:19.447,01:20:21.550,And how do you know Alex?
01:20:23.451,01:20:29.024,I hope-- I'm pretty sure that something's about to happen between us.
01:20:29.157,01:20:30.592,BRUCE: Ooh. NATHAN: Oh.
01:20:30.926,01:20:34.529,"So are you here as, like, a guest, or, like, his date?"
01:20:34.863,01:20:38.433,"Oh, I hate that. When you don't know if you're a date."
01:20:38.567,01:20:42.003,"You don't know if you should bring a friend, or are you co-hosting..."
01:20:42.137,01:20:44.873,...or should you stay to the end to have some alone time?
01:20:45.006,01:20:47.409,He didn't say. I'm sure I'm more than just a guest.
01:20:48.343,01:20:50.145,"-I mean, there have been signs. -Cool."
01:21:16.404,01:21:17.572,DOMINIC: So where's Neil?
01:21:17.906,01:21:18.974,We broke up.
01:21:19.107,01:21:21.309,-No way. -Yeah.
01:21:21.910,01:21:24.045,"You guys were together, what, like 10 years?"
01:21:24.179,01:21:26.014,"Seven. But still, it's a long time."
01:21:26.147,01:21:27.249,Yeah.
01:21:27.916,01:21:32.921,"It's too bad cousins can't marry, because then we could maybe-- Oh, Dominic."
01:21:33.188,01:21:35.257,-Gross. -No.
01:21:37.292,01:21:39.060,"MAN 1: Ken, are you okay? What happened?"
01:21:41.329,01:21:42.330,"WOMAN 1: Oh, my God."
01:21:42.464,01:21:44.900,"WOMAN 2: Ken, are you all right? MAN: Just clutched his chest."
01:21:45.033,01:21:49.170,"WOMAN 1: He was standing there and all of a sudden-- WOMAN 2: Ken, just try to breathe. MAN 2: Call 911."
01:21:49.304,01:21:50.405,BETH: Dad. Excuse me.
01:21:50.538,01:21:53.141,"Daddy, what is it? What happened? What happened?"
01:21:53.275,01:21:55.210,"-Guys, come here! LAURA: What happened?"
01:21:55.343,01:21:56.912,"BETH: Daddy, lay down, okay?"
01:21:57.045,01:21:58.313,LAURA: Did he fall? BETH: You'll be fine.
01:21:58.446,01:22:01.349,"You guys, did anybody see what happened?"
01:22:01.483,01:22:04.085,LAURA: Over there. Just go get it. -Okay.
01:22:06.421,01:22:08.623,"Hey, hey. I had no idea it'd be such a madhouse."
01:22:08.957,01:22:10.191,Hey. Great party.
01:22:10.325,01:22:12.627,Thanks. Did any guys hit on you? A lot of them here.
01:22:12.961,01:22:15.463,You need me to evaluate any level of interest?
01:22:15.597,01:22:19.000,They were gay. Even I know their level of interest was probably low.
01:22:19.134,01:22:20.168,"ALEX: Hey, Skilo!"
01:22:20.302,01:22:23.471,It's too bad Bill couldn't make it. I know you guys would hit it off.
01:22:23.605,01:22:25.106,"Okay, right. Bill."
01:22:26.241,01:22:27.242,Right.
01:22:31.413,01:22:35.717,"Listen, I gotta go make a liquor run, but the food needs some refreshing."
01:22:36.518,01:22:39.254,-Would you mind helping and refilling--? -Like co-hosting?
01:22:40.555,01:22:42.657,"Okay, yeah."
01:22:42.991,01:22:44.025,Sure.
01:22:44.159,01:22:46.428,Just refilling the chips. They're on the fridge.
01:22:46.561,01:22:47.662,Thanks.
01:22:52.067,01:22:54.402,"MAN 1: Hey, sweetie, get me a beer? -I'll get you another."
01:22:54.536,01:22:57.105,"-Hi, guys. -Nice."
01:22:57.238,01:22:59.240,"Hey, Linda."
01:23:15.023,01:23:17.258,"-Really great party. -Oh, thanks."
01:23:18.093,01:23:21.696,"You know, when Alex said he wanted to throw a party, I was like, Let's do it!"
01:23:22.030,01:23:24.666,"-Thanks for having us. -No problem, any time."
01:23:25.533,01:23:27.035,Can I help you find something?
01:23:27.168,01:23:29.237,"Oh, no, it's okay. I got it."
01:23:29.371,01:23:30.705,Thanks for mixing that up.
01:23:31.573,01:23:32.640,What?
01:23:32.774,01:23:36.511,Alex asked me to get the dip together. Thanks for getting it started.
01:23:37.712,01:23:39.547,It could use a little more dill.
01:23:39.681,01:23:41.449,"I'm on it, though, don't worry."
01:23:45.587,01:23:47.389,"Come on, my boy. Take it home."
01:23:47.522,01:23:49.391,Franchise player. My boy Marbury.
01:23:49.524,01:23:51.226,GIRL: Fifteen seconds. ALEX: Let's go.
01:23:51.359,01:23:53.595,"GIRL: Oh, a pass. ALEX: You work too hard."
01:23:53.728,01:23:57.198,"Well, I think I've rounded up the last of the beer bottles."
01:23:58.566,01:24:01.569,"-Oh, what game are we playing? -Oh, sorry, Nash."
01:24:01.703,01:24:04.072,"-Oh, come on. -Come on, come on."
01:24:04.205,01:24:09.644,"ALEX: Nash, you piece of shit. Come on. -Maybe I should just-- -It's past 3, so.... ALEX: Okay, swat it."
01:24:09.778,01:24:11.346,GIRL: Watch this. Ready?
01:24:11.479,01:24:13.114,"-And.... ALEX: Oh, no, no, no!"
01:24:13.248,01:24:16.418,Yes. Suck it. Yes.
01:24:16.551,01:24:18.486,"Oh, you are-- You're sensational."
01:24:18.620,01:24:19.687,"-Yeah, I know. -Jesus."
01:24:20.455,01:24:22.090,I don't know why I bother.
01:24:22.223,01:24:24.225,-Did you say it's past 3? -Yeah.
01:24:24.359,01:24:27.595,"-Oh, man, I gotta go. Hey, good game. -All right."
01:24:27.729,01:24:29.764,GIRL: Bye. GIGI: Bye.
01:24:52.754,01:24:55.824,"Hey, thanks for staying and helping me clean up."
01:24:56.791,01:24:59.127,"I really gotta go to bed, though."
01:24:59.260,01:25:00.662,Is that an invitation?
01:25:01.563,01:25:02.597,What?
01:25:04.132,01:25:06.267,"Oh, God, that was cheesy."
01:25:06.601,01:25:09.204,"Oh, I'm not good at this."
01:25:09.537,01:25:10.672,What?
01:25:19.681,01:25:21.116,ALEX: Hey.
01:25:21.416,01:25:23.585,"Oh, yes. I knew it."
01:25:23.718,01:25:26.788,The best relationships grow out of friendships.
01:25:27.122,01:25:29.157,"Wait, wait, wait. Gigi."
01:25:29.691,01:25:31.826,"Wait, wait, wait."
01:25:32.160,01:25:33.428,What?
01:25:33.561,01:25:35.430,Now you and I are in a relationship?
01:25:35.563,01:25:39.467,"Well, I'd say if we're not at relationship station-ship..."
01:25:39.601,01:25:41.169,...we're at least on the track.
01:25:42.504,01:25:45.507,And why exactly would you think that?
01:25:45.640,01:25:47.442,Because of the signs.
01:25:47.909,01:25:49.410,"Really, like what?"
01:25:49.544,01:25:52.714,"Like, it was good to hear from me..."
01:25:52.847,01:25:56.351,...and you talked to me even when you were with a girl...
01:25:56.484,01:25:59.254,...and I felt something.
01:25:59.687,01:26:01.623,"Oh, man."
01:26:01.756,01:26:03.191,What are you talking about?
01:26:03.324,01:26:06.561,"Gigi, what have I been saying since I met you?"
01:26:06.694,01:26:10.431,"If a guy wants to date you, he will make it happen, okay? He will ask you out."
01:26:10.565,01:26:11.733,Did I ask you out?
01:26:12.934,01:26:14.202,No.
01:26:14.335,01:26:16.771,Why would you do this?
01:26:17.205,01:26:19.207,"Oh, shit."
01:26:19.340,01:26:21.876,Why do women do this? Build up this stuff in their minds...
01:26:22.210,01:26:25.914,"...take each little thing a guy does, and then twist it into something else?"
01:26:26.247,01:26:27.815,It's insane.
01:26:38.326,01:26:41.362,I'd rather be like that than be like you.
01:26:43.464,01:26:44.632,Excuse me?
01:26:44.766,01:26:46.768,What is that supposed to mean?
01:26:49.237,01:26:51.806,I may dissect each little thing...
01:26:51.940,01:26:55.210,...and put myself out there too much...
01:26:55.343,01:26:57.612,...but at least that means I still care.
01:26:57.745,01:27:03.651,"Oh, you think you've won because women are expendable to you?"
01:27:03.785,01:27:08.256,You may not get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way...
01:27:08.389,01:27:10.925,...but you don't fall in love that way either.
01:27:11.259,01:27:12.860,You have not won.
01:27:12.994,01:27:15.330,"You're alone, Alex."
01:27:21.936,01:27:24.405,I may do a lot of stupid shit...
01:27:24.539,01:27:28.943,...but I know I'm a lot closer to finding someone than you are.
01:27:36.985,01:27:39.287,BETH: Do you want anything else?
01:27:39.420,01:27:42.824,"Yeah, less of the cardboard crap and more regular people food."
01:27:42.957,01:27:47.629,"Well, that cardboard crap is what we call whole-wheat toast."
01:27:47.962,01:27:51.566,"Well, maybe you could just fry me up a couple of sausage links."
01:27:51.699,01:27:54.802,People who have just had a heart attack are generally not advised...
01:27:54.936,01:27:58.506,...to have animal fat that's been stuffed into a synthetic casing.
01:28:09.284,01:28:12.820,"STEVEN: Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer when you get to the kitchen, okay?"
01:28:12.954,01:28:15.823,"And a little plate of cold cuts, if there are any left."
01:28:15.957,01:28:19.594,"Hey, would you guys please just turn that down a bit? Dad's trying to sleep."
01:28:19.727,01:28:21.729,You think he wants to hang on to this vinyl?
01:28:21.863,01:28:23.865,My collection could use a lot of these.
01:28:23.998,01:28:26.467,Would you just turn it the fuck down?
01:28:29.704,01:28:32.307,"Well, we're totally out of toilet paper..."
01:28:32.440,01:28:36.944,...and all we have left to eat is some old jelly and some ramen noodles.
01:28:37.078,01:28:41.816,And our new brother would like to co-opt Dad's property before he's even dead.
01:28:41.949,01:28:45.053,"Laura, also your husband would really like another beer..."
01:28:45.386,01:28:48.489,...to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf network.
01:28:50.491,01:28:51.959,Are you okay?
01:28:53.528,01:28:56.097,"Don't worry, honey, Dad's gonna be fine."
01:28:57.865,01:28:59.500,GIGI: Do you know who it is? -No.
01:29:00.768,01:29:02.637,Doesn't matter.
01:29:03.938,01:29:05.506,So are you gonna leave him?
01:29:06.574,01:29:09.644,"Gigi, he's my husband."
01:29:09.777,01:29:12.914,He's not some guy who didn't call me back.
01:29:13.047,01:29:14.982,He did admit it to me.
01:29:15.483,01:29:18.886,"He didn't wait to get caught, which takes courage, you know?"
01:29:19.821,01:29:22.123,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean that."
01:29:22.457,01:29:23.658,I didn't mean it.
01:29:23.791,01:29:26.361,I know that Alex wasn't just some guy.
01:29:26.661,01:29:28.663,"Oh, it's okay."
01:29:32.667,01:29:33.935,"It's my fault, you know."
01:29:34.535,01:29:35.603,What?
01:29:35.737,01:29:41.943,"Oh, I just think I need to take responsibility for my share in the whole..."
01:29:42.076,01:29:44.746,...mess. You know?
01:29:44.879,01:29:47.682,I forced him into getting married.
01:29:48.616,01:29:51.385,"-You know, he wasn't ready. -Janine, this isn't your fault."
01:29:51.519,01:29:54.555,"No, it is. It is, I've changed."
01:29:55.156,01:29:56.958,I was...
01:29:57.992,01:30:00.094,"...fun, you know?"
01:30:00.628,01:30:02.463,I was fun when we first met.
01:30:02.597,01:30:03.698,You're still fun.
01:30:12.540,01:30:13.841,We don't have sex anymore.
01:30:19.647,01:30:21.516,Lots of couples go through lulls.
01:30:21.649,01:30:23.050,"No, I mean..."
01:30:25.586,01:30:28.489,...we never have sex.
01:30:36.430,01:30:39.467,"I mean, realistically, what do I expect him to do, you know?"
01:30:39.600,01:30:41.836,I don't think that's really....
01:30:43.638,01:30:46.140,"God, this tile is too small."
01:30:46.474,01:30:48.442,I have to tell Javier.
01:30:48.810,01:30:51.946,-What? -This tile is too small.
01:30:52.180,01:30:56.050,"I gotta go. I have to take a personal day, if anyone asks."
01:31:04.559,01:31:07.762,"MARIEL: Well, my first husband was unimpressive."
01:31:07.895,01:31:10.731,I found him in bed with his big-breasted secretary...
01:31:10.865,01:31:13.034,...when I came home early from the Maldives.
01:31:13.167,01:31:16.070,It was just so unoriginal.
01:31:16.204,01:31:18.706,Made me feel sorry for him.
01:31:18.840,01:31:22.577,My second husband was a pinch more creative.
01:31:22.710,01:31:24.545,Cheated on me with my sister...
01:31:24.679,01:31:29.750,...but made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious.
01:31:29.884,01:31:33.254,"So at least some mind games, some intrigue."
01:31:33.588,01:31:37.091,"But my last husband, he was a gem."
01:31:37.225,01:31:40.161,He was a veritable master at covering his tracks.
01:31:40.494,01:31:45.233,"I mean, I pored over his phone records, I intercepted his credit-card bills..."
01:31:45.566,01:31:47.668,...I had him followed on numerous occasions...
01:31:47.802,01:31:51.072,...and never found a single shred of evidence.
01:31:51.205,01:31:53.708,It wasn't until he died...
01:31:53.841,01:31:59.013,...that I found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress.
01:31:59.146,01:32:03.918,"But the real master, I have to say, is me."
01:32:04.051,01:32:09.790,"Three husbands, countless boyfriends, I haven't been caught yet."
01:32:10.057,01:32:12.159,"ANNA: Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
01:32:14.562,01:32:17.565,"-Oh, my God, oh, my God. I can't-- -Shh."
01:32:23.304,01:32:25.106,BEN: It's over there.
01:32:28.776,01:32:30.311,"ANNA: Oh, my God."
01:32:30.645,01:32:32.246,He liked the demo. I can't believe it.
01:32:32.580,01:32:33.648,It's unbelievable.
01:32:33.781,01:32:36.550,Did you hear when he said that it was hauntingly beautiful?
01:32:36.684,01:32:40.588,"Yeah, I was there. I was-- I was there, baby."
01:32:40.988,01:32:42.790,Thank you.
01:33:14.855,01:33:21.929,"Dana, I'm working. I'm still going over some offering statements. You gotta-- You gotta come back later."
01:33:22.730,01:33:24.765,JANINE: It's not Dana.
01:33:27.868,01:33:28.903,Is that your--?
01:33:29.904,01:33:31.105,-Is that your--? -Shh.
01:33:35.009,01:33:36.644,-Get in the closet. -What?
01:33:36.777,01:33:39.180,Just go in the closet for a second. Just for a second.
01:33:39.313,01:33:40.314,Ben?
01:33:43.184,01:33:46.320,I keep telling Dana to get that damn lock fixed.
01:33:47.021,01:33:49.957,JANINE: Why do you even bother locking it? -What?
01:33:50.091,01:33:52.626,JANINE: Why do you bother locking it?
01:33:53.627,01:33:56.697,"Oh, you know I can't get any work done if I don't."
01:34:04.205,01:34:06.807,-Hey. -Hi.
01:34:07.308,01:34:09.877,"-Can I come in? -Yeah, of course."
01:34:22.723,01:34:23.758,What are you doing?
01:34:24.825,01:34:26.293,JANINE: Sit down.
01:34:26.694,01:34:28.129,BEN: Okay.
01:34:40.207,01:34:41.909,Hon?
01:34:46.814,01:34:47.848,What are you doing?
01:34:48.249,01:34:50.384,I don't know. I just thought...
01:34:50.718,01:34:55.289,...maybe we could-- -Sorry. -Are you okay?
01:34:55.423,01:34:57.425,JANINE: Maybe if you just go over there.
01:34:57.758,01:34:59.994,Just trying to...
01:35:00.828,01:35:02.696,"...you know, re-light the fire."
01:35:02.830,01:35:04.965,"Oh, honey."
01:35:05.099,01:35:09.270,Didn't you hear what I said before? I really gotta finish these offerings.
01:35:11.238,01:35:12.940,Look...
01:35:14.375,01:35:16.777,...I'm really trying here.
01:35:19.013,01:35:22.116,Do you wanna save our marriage?
01:35:27.054,01:35:28.989,Of course.
01:35:29.490,01:35:31.125,Me too.
01:35:55.282,01:35:59.086,"Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in with the bussers when you can."
01:35:59.220,01:36:01.188,Wait a minute. I'm on 8 through 10.
01:36:01.922,01:36:04.925,"Hey, I been working here 18 months, 8 through 10."
01:36:06.093,01:36:08.062,ALEX: Minor oversight.
01:36:09.797,01:36:12.500,"Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then."
01:36:12.833,01:36:16.203,"Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago."
01:36:18.005,01:36:19.406,"MAN: Yeah, he quit."
01:36:20.875,01:36:23.811,Is there any reason we're even having this meeting?
01:36:23.944,01:36:25.079,Not really.
01:36:25.212,01:36:27.214,"-No, not for me. ALEX: Great. Good. Great."
01:36:27.348,01:36:29.250,Meeting adjourned.
01:36:29.383,01:36:31.218,Back to work.
01:36:35.856,01:36:38.092,"Hey, Kelli Ann."
01:36:40.227,01:36:41.929,Did I get any calls?
01:36:42.062,01:36:47.334,"Since you asked me 11 minutes ago, no. Not a lot of phone traffic."
01:36:52.106,01:36:54.308,"-Oh, my God. -What?"
01:36:55.042,01:36:56.110,What's her name?
01:36:58.012,01:36:59.280,Who?
01:36:59.413,01:37:00.948,"The girl, Alex."
01:37:01.448,01:37:03.584,There's no girl.
01:37:03.918,01:37:05.252,"You can't hide it, man."
01:37:05.386,01:37:08.923,I know strung out and you are strung out.
01:37:10.858,01:37:13.294,"Okay, please."
01:37:13.928,01:37:15.396,KELLI ANN: This is amazing.
01:37:16.030,01:37:17.865,"You can't focus, right?"
01:37:17.998,01:37:22.203,"Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your e-mail 100 times a day..."
01:37:22.336,01:37:24.138,...wishing you could write songs.
01:37:24.271,01:37:29.009,"No, feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations."
01:37:29.543,01:37:33.414,"It's always the same and it has happened to you, my friend."
01:37:37.251,01:37:38.886,Shit.
01:37:41.355,01:37:42.856,"Welcome to my world, asshole."
01:37:44.992,01:37:46.594,Let me get the door.
01:37:50.297,01:37:53.200,Sure I can't interest you in a little beef and broccoli?
01:37:53.334,01:37:55.236,I gotta finish this stuff.
01:37:55.369,01:37:56.904,Okay.
01:37:58.305,01:38:01.242,-Yeah. So I'll see you at home. -Okay.
01:38:02.209,01:38:03.944,I love you.
01:38:04.345,01:38:06.213,I love you too.
01:38:11.051,01:38:13.287,"-Okay. I'll see you later. Okay, bye. -Bye."
01:38:21.629,01:38:23.330,-You make me sick. -I had no choice.
01:38:23.464,01:38:26.300,-You're a disgusting excuse for a man! -What was I supposed to do?
01:38:26.433,01:38:28.602,-You're the one I wanna be-- -Don't touch me!
01:38:28.936,01:38:31.238,You will never touch me again.
01:38:36.377,01:38:38.946,"Dino, thanks again for letting me pay over the phone."
01:38:39.079,01:38:43.117,I assure you this late-payment thing will never happen again.
01:38:43.250,01:38:45.919,"Yep, just trying to trim some of the drama out of my life."
01:38:47.187,01:38:48.255,"Oh, that's my other line."
01:38:48.389,01:38:49.556,"Okay, bye."
01:38:49.690,01:38:51.925,"-Hello? BILL: Hi, Gigi?"
01:38:52.059,01:38:53.360,This is Bill.
01:38:53.494,01:38:55.496,-Bill...? -Alex's friend.
01:38:55.629,01:38:59.933,We were supposed to meet up but Alex told me the wrong day.
01:39:00.501,01:39:02.503,"Bill, so you do exist."
01:39:02.636,01:39:04.104,I do.
01:39:04.238,01:39:08.275,And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime if you're still game.
01:39:09.376,01:39:10.577,Yes.
01:39:10.711,01:39:13.013,"Sure, why not?"
01:39:20.688,01:39:22.089,Hey.
01:39:22.222,01:39:24.291,"Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming."
01:39:24.425,01:39:26.960,"Hi. Hi, sweetie."
01:39:27.294,01:39:29.129,"See, why did you just call me sweetie?"
01:39:29.263,01:39:32.366,-We always call each other that. -Why?
01:39:32.499,01:39:35.502,"All right, look, I wanna say something, okay?"
01:39:35.636,01:39:38.138,We call each other sweetie all the time.
01:39:38.272,01:39:41.108,And we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours.
01:39:41.241,01:39:44.545,I washed your hair for you after you had shoulder surgery and everything.
01:39:44.678,01:39:46.146,And it's like we're together.
01:39:46.280,01:39:48.415,"-I know that I've been-- -No, hold on a second."
01:39:48.549,01:39:50.417,Let me finish.
01:39:50.551,01:39:52.419,I think maybe this is my fault...
01:39:52.553,01:39:56.323,...because maybe I wasn't clear about exactly what I want.
01:39:56.457,01:39:59.159,So let me-- Let me be clear.
01:39:59.293,01:40:01.228,I love hanging out.
01:40:01.495,01:40:05.366,But I'm so attracted to you. I just-- I want both.
01:40:05.499,01:40:08.302,I don't know what happened or why we stopped. I don't care.
01:40:08.435,01:40:10.003,Okay.
01:40:11.205,01:40:12.673,-What? -Okay.
01:40:13.006,01:40:16.176,"No, I'm talking about really doing this. Like a full-on relationship."
01:40:16.310,01:40:17.711,Right.
01:40:18.045,01:40:19.313,With me.
01:40:19.446,01:40:20.748,Yeah.
01:40:22.349,01:40:24.251,A bunch of gay people put you up to this?
01:40:24.385,01:40:26.220,Stop talking.
01:40:45.205,01:40:48.375,"DEVON: Stay home. It's an end-around. GEORGE: No, no, it's not. He's still got it."
01:40:48.509,01:40:50.077,He's still got it.
01:40:50.210,01:40:52.679,STEVEN: Shit. -Who let that happen? It's embarrassing.
01:40:52.813,01:40:56.650,GEORGE: Argh! DEVON: That is so embarrassing.
01:40:57.151,01:40:58.185,What?
01:40:59.386,01:41:01.822,Did any of you guys have a chance to get to the store?
01:41:02.456,01:41:04.625,"Oh, yeah, no. We're good, we got takeout."
01:41:05.259,01:41:10.531,"No, I didn't mean for you, I meant f-- GEORGE: All right, here we go. -Come on, defense, wake up."
01:41:12.232,01:41:14.835,You have to be kidding me.
01:41:28.248,01:41:31.518,I just got a little bit more of this I gotta finish.
01:41:31.652,01:41:33.787,There's some laundry I'm gonna put away...
01:41:34.121,01:41:36.723,...then I had another load of clothes in the dryer.
01:41:37.324,01:41:40.527,"I did get some of the food your dad likes, but some healthy stuff too."
01:41:40.661,01:41:42.529,"Just, you know."
01:41:45.499,01:41:47.568,It's gonna be okay.
01:41:50.404,01:41:51.505,It'll be okay.
01:43:00.574,01:43:02.676,Bend your knee a little bit more. There you go.
01:43:02.809,01:43:04.912,"Inhale, reverse warrior, look up."
01:43:05.245,01:43:06.346,Exhale.
01:43:17.858,01:43:53.694,"Hi, you've reached Ben's cell phone. Please leave-- You lying sack of shit!"
01:43:58.966,01:44:00.701,Lying!
01:44:00.834,01:44:01.868,Sack!
01:44:02.002,01:44:03.670,Shit!
01:44:42.909,01:44:44.711,Okay.
01:44:55.055,01:44:56.957,"GIGI: --or call my cell, or try me at work..."
01:44:57.290,01:45:00.560,...but definitely leave a message here first. Thanks.
01:45:00.694,01:45:03.930,"Hey, Gigi, it's Alex."
01:45:04.598,01:45:06.433,How's it going?
01:45:06.566,01:45:08.468,Just wondering how you're doing.
01:45:08.602,01:45:12.472,I haven't talked to you in a little while...
01:45:12.606,01:45:14.741,...and was just wondering how you're doing.
01:45:14.875,01:45:18.612,"So, hey, I was hoping to talk to you."
01:45:19.546,01:45:21.615,Obviously.
01:45:22.049,01:45:23.984,"But you're out, I guess."
01:45:24.317,01:45:27.888,So just call me sometime.
01:45:28.021,01:45:29.356,Or tonight.
01:45:29.489,01:45:31.958,"I'm around, I'll be-- Well, I'm in and around."
01:45:32.726,01:45:35.495,So that's enough for now.
01:45:36.897,01:45:38.665,It's Alex.
01:45:38.799,01:45:40.500,Okay.
01:45:44.004,01:45:45.038,Dude.
01:45:46.106,01:45:47.774,I know.
01:46:06.760,01:46:07.794,Hey.
01:46:07.928,01:46:09.696,Hey.
01:46:11.698,01:46:12.933,Welcome aboard.
01:46:13.066,01:46:14.401,Might I come aboard?
01:46:14.534,01:46:16.870,Yeah. You remember the boat.
01:46:17.003,01:46:19.639,"Well, you know, I thought I did."
01:46:19.773,01:46:22.109,"-Or, you know, little.... -But it's been a while."
01:46:22.442,01:46:26.680,"You know that dock? Over there, there's a boat that looks just like yours."
01:46:26.813,01:46:28.148,NEIL: Uh-huh. -It's not yours.
01:46:28.482,01:46:30.784,"-No, that's not my boat. -It's definitely not."
01:46:30.917,01:46:34.454,But there's a very nice gentleman...
01:46:34.588,01:46:35.822,...living on the boat...
01:46:35.956,01:46:39.059,...who invited me in for a white-wine spritzer.
01:46:39.392,01:46:40.494,"Oh, good."
01:46:40.627,01:46:44.631,Wasn't expecting visitors.
01:46:44.765,01:46:48.769,That's all right. I just wanted to just come by and say thanks...
01:46:48.902,01:46:50.837,...for helping yesterday.
01:46:50.971,01:46:55.008,"Beth, you know, I'm the same person."
01:46:55.142,01:46:57.711,I would do anything for you.
01:46:57.844,01:47:00.180,I just can't give you....
01:47:00.514,01:47:02.115,I just can't give you what you want.
01:47:02.449,01:47:04.084,You're what I want.
01:47:04.417,01:47:07.521,Our life together is what I want.
01:47:07.654,01:47:08.722,I miss it.
01:47:08.855,01:47:10.123,I miss you.
01:47:10.457,01:47:15.662,"You see those guys my sisters are married to-- You're more of a husband to me, not being married..."
01:47:15.796,01:47:19.166,"...than those real husbands are ever gonna be, and...."
01:47:19.499,01:47:23.603,It's enough. It's really enough for me.
01:47:25.939,01:47:28.475,And you would be willing...
01:47:28.608,01:47:33.013,...to take the whole marriage thing off the table completely?
01:47:33.146,01:47:39.553,"If you promise to commit to me and to love me, and-- -I already have. -I'm not finished."
01:47:40.086,01:47:41.755,Okay. All right.
01:47:41.888,01:47:45.525,-But I've loved you for seven years-- -Ah-ah.
01:47:45.659,01:47:47.127,Okay.
01:47:48.495,01:47:52.165,You have to snake the drain when my hair gets clogged.
01:47:52.499,01:47:54.501,You know that happens. Okay?
01:47:54.634,01:47:55.969,Okay. Yeah.
01:47:56.102,01:47:57.904,And also...
01:48:00.040,01:48:03.610,...you have to let me eat those Wheat Thins in bed. You gotta give me that.
01:48:03.743,01:48:05.745,"-Okay, fine. All right. -Okay?"
01:48:06.947,01:48:08.715,And....
01:48:09.182,01:48:10.650,-Yeah. -And?
01:48:10.784,01:48:13.153,-That's it. -Okay.
01:48:17.057,01:48:18.592,Do I get to come home now?
01:48:19.559,01:48:21.628,I guess you can.
01:48:24.764,01:48:26.933,But these cannot come.
01:48:27.534,01:48:29.002,"-What, my pants--? -That's correct."
01:48:29.135,01:48:31.504,-Can't come home? Why? -No.
01:48:31.638,01:48:34.841,"You just won a really big battle, my friend. Come on."
01:48:36.676,01:48:42.082,"So we're not gonna get married, but I have to get rid of my pants."
01:48:42.215,01:48:45.085,Mm-hm. And we both win.
01:48:45.585,01:48:48.555,All right. I'll get rid of them if you like.
01:48:48.755,01:48:50.690,You're getting a lot of bids on this place?
01:48:50.824,01:48:54.027,"Yeah. I know it's crazy, but it's a neighborhood in transition."
01:48:54.160,01:48:57.163,"Is that like young, hip, gay couples or something like that?"
01:48:57.297,01:49:01.568,"Yeah. Hip gay people, young couples, young families."
01:49:04.571,01:49:05.939,ANNA: Wow.
01:49:06.673,01:49:09.576,"God, this reminds me of where I grew up."
01:49:09.910,01:49:15.148,I bet it's got one of the-- Wait a minute.
01:49:15.715,01:49:17.951,"Oh, yeah."
01:49:18.251,01:49:21.321,"Yeah, that's it."
01:49:22.722,01:49:24.591,We used to have the exact same one...
01:49:24.724,01:49:27.994,...except my mom used it as a desk.
01:49:30.063,01:49:32.032,So...
01:49:32.632,01:49:35.235,...when do all the fabulous people arrive?
01:49:35.568,01:49:37.704,"Well, actually, the open house is tomorrow."
01:49:37.837,01:49:40.040,But I have this one buyer...
01:49:40.173,01:49:43.843,...and I wanted to make sure his girlfriend likes it first.
01:49:44.277,01:49:46.746,"Oh, he has a girlfriend, huh?"
01:49:48.181,01:49:50.150,"Yeah, I have an idea."
01:49:50.283,01:49:51.685,For this house.
01:49:51.818,01:49:52.919,For me.
01:49:53.053,01:49:55.889,"And hopefully, if you like it..."
01:49:56.022,01:49:58.692,"...and things continue to, you know...."
01:50:00.160,01:50:01.695,Anna...
01:50:01.828,01:50:03.897,"...I have a plan, okay?"
01:50:04.030,01:50:07.000,"I know where my life is going, and I want you to go with me."
01:50:07.133,01:50:09.336,I'm not saying I want you to move in right now...
01:50:09.669,01:50:13.640,"...but I don't want to buy this place unless, at some point..."
01:50:13.773,01:50:15.976,...you could see yourself moving in.
01:50:16.643,01:50:18.178,"So, what do you think?"
01:50:19.846,01:50:22.048,I can't do this.
01:50:23.049,01:50:24.751,Okay.
01:50:25.819,01:50:31.124,"Well, if it's too fast, I guess we can always just-- I can't do any of this."
01:50:31.891,01:50:33.159,I mean...
01:50:33.293,01:50:37.831,...what you're saying and what you're offering...
01:50:37.964,01:50:41.034,...is what every girl wants.
01:50:41.167,01:50:43.636,It's what I always wanted.
01:50:43.770,01:50:45.772,It's just....
01:50:52.379,01:50:53.813,You don't want it with me.
01:51:14.701,01:51:15.702,Okay.
01:51:17.103,01:51:18.972,I have a question.
01:51:20.306,01:51:22.742,Is there any way we could...
01:51:23.710,01:51:26.713,"...dial it back to before, when we were just sleeping together..."
01:51:26.846,01:51:30.917,"...because I don't know, I felt like that gelled."
01:51:44.864,01:51:46.299,Babe?
01:52:21.034,01:52:22.235,It was nice meeting you.
01:52:22.368,01:52:24.771,Thank you so much for a lovely evening.
01:52:24.904,01:52:26.773,You too.
01:52:33.046,01:52:34.047,Good night.
01:52:53.099,01:52:55.201,You forget something?
01:52:56.169,01:52:58.171,"Yeah, I did."
01:52:59.005,01:53:01.207,Really? What did you forget?
01:53:04.944,01:53:06.346,This.
01:53:11.217,01:53:15.788,You came all the way here at 11:00 at night to bring me back a promotional pen?
01:53:15.922,01:53:16.990,Yeah.
01:53:17.123,01:53:22.395,I thought I should just come up with some really great excuse to get over here.
01:53:22.529,01:53:24.831,"That's how it's done, isn't it?"
01:53:26.166,01:53:27.433,Sometimes.
01:53:27.567,01:53:30.236,"Look, I can't stop thinking about you."
01:53:30.803,01:53:31.971,It's a problem.
01:53:32.105,01:53:36.276,"I drive by your place, I call and hang up."
01:53:36.409,01:53:39.179,I'm turning into-- Me.
01:53:40.113,01:53:41.848,Yeah.
01:53:44.951,01:53:47.220,A wise person once told me...
01:53:47.353,01:53:52.192,"...that if a guy wants to be with a girl he will make it happen, no matter what."
01:53:52.325,01:53:53.393,That's true.
01:53:53.526,01:53:56.563,But when I was hurling my body onto yours...
01:53:56.896,01:53:58.998,...you did not seem to want to make it happen.
01:53:59.132,01:54:04.103,"Yeah, all right. Here's the thing about that: You were right."
01:54:04.237,01:54:08.007,I've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from all these women...
01:54:08.141,01:54:09.409,...and having the power...
01:54:09.542,01:54:11.878,...that I didn't know what it felt like...
01:54:12.011,01:54:14.147,...when I actually fell...
01:54:14.280,01:54:16.416,...for one of them.
01:54:19.452,01:54:21.421,I didn't know.
01:54:30.463,01:54:32.966,"Look, I just went out with your friend Bill and...."
01:54:33.099,01:54:34.167,Yeah.
01:54:34.300,01:54:36.936,He might be just exactly what I need.
01:54:37.070,01:54:38.872,No drama.
01:54:39.005,01:54:41.241,"He calls, he does what he says."
01:54:41.374,01:54:43.476,-I can do that stuff too. -But you didn't.
01:54:43.610,01:54:46.246,And that same wise person told me that I am the rule.
01:54:46.379,01:54:50.049,That I have to stop thinking that every guy will change.
01:54:50.183,01:55:11.471,That I have to stop thinking that-- I'm the exception.
01:55:14.574,01:55:17.210,You are my exception.
01:56:00.520,01:56:01.521,Conor Barry.
01:56:01.654,01:56:04.223,"Hi, it's Mary at the Blade."
01:56:04.357,01:56:06.592,I'm looking at your new ad and I love it.
01:56:07.527,01:56:10.196,Really? You don't think the muscle T is too much?
01:56:10.730,01:56:14.534,I think the shirt you're wearing now is probably more you.
01:56:16.469,01:56:17.737,"What, you here?"
01:56:18.071,01:56:20.239,I'm sitting right in front of you.
01:56:21.507,01:56:23.409,"Wow, this is you. Mary."
01:56:23.543,01:56:24.610,It's me.
01:56:24.744,01:56:26.145,I'm me.
01:56:30.016,01:56:31.284,Should I--?
01:56:31.517,01:56:32.986,-Please. Please. -Okay.
01:56:33.119,01:56:35.154,-Talk to you in a minute. -See you in a second.
01:56:35.288,01:56:37.156,Okay.
01:56:38.758,01:56:40.426,Hey.
01:56:40.560,01:56:42.028,-Hi. -How are you?
01:56:42.161,01:56:43.463,It's nice to finally meet you.
01:56:43.596,01:56:44.664,-You too. -In person.
01:56:45.298,01:56:47.467,This is a pleasant surprise.
01:56:47.600,01:56:49.002,-You.... -What?
01:56:49.135,01:56:52.238,-I don't know. Not what I expected. -My voice doesn't match my face?
01:56:52.372,01:56:54.674,CONOR: Your voice does not match your face in a good way.
01:56:55.008,01:56:58.044,"In a-- Yeah, I mean-- That sounded terrible."
01:57:02.548,01:57:04.317,Amazing.
01:57:04.450,01:57:06.719,I don't know how all this stuff fit in here before.
01:57:07.053,01:57:09.789,I know. It seems like it just expanded.
01:57:18.731,01:57:23.202,You are not trying to get these back in here.
01:57:23.336,01:57:26.305,"-You are not getting rid of these pants. -We had a deal, mister."
01:57:26.439,01:57:27.740,These are not staying.
01:57:28.074,01:57:32.345,-You can store those horizontally. -Goodwill wouldn't even take these.
01:57:32.478,01:57:38.551,"They could be pressed, flattened, you can-- If you're gonna throw them out, at least check the pockets, all right?"
01:57:38.684,01:57:42.388,So you don't throw away some personal items.
01:57:59.605,01:58:02.775,I love you so much.
01:58:03.576,01:58:05.244,So much.
01:58:05.745,01:58:08.114,And I wanna make you happy.
01:58:08.614,01:58:10.550,I need to make you happy...
01:58:10.683,01:58:15.121,...for me to even have a shot at being happy.
01:58:16.355,01:58:21.527,Will you marry me?
01:58:27.200,01:58:30.670,"Yes, of course I will. Yes."
01:58:30.803,01:58:32.472,Yes.
01:58:37.143,01:58:38.811,NEIL: Thank God.
01:58:42.748,01:58:47.720,"GIGI: Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up: If a guy punches you, he likes you."
01:58:47.854,01:58:50.256,Never try to trim your own bangs.
01:58:50.389,01:58:55.361,And someday you will meet a wonderful guy and get your very own happy ending.
01:58:55.495,01:58:57.230,--and your commitment to each other.
01:58:58.698,01:59:02.168,"GIGI: Every movie we see, every story we're told..."

01:59:04.704,01:59:10.576,The third act twist: The unexpected declaration of love.
01:59:11.544,01:59:13.646,The exception to the rule.
01:59:13.779,01:59:17.450,But sometimes we're so focused on finding our happy ending...
01:59:17.583,01:59:20.319,...we don't learn how to read the signs.
01:59:20.453,01:59:23.422,How to tell the ones who want us from the ones who don't.
01:59:23.556,01:59:26.792,The ones who will stay from the ones who will leave.
01:59:35.468,01:59:37.336,-Hi. -Hi.
01:59:37.770,01:59:42.275,GIGI: And maybe this happy ending doesn't include a wonderful guy.
01:59:43.543,01:59:46.546,Maybe it's you...
01:59:48.181,01:59:49.882,...on your own...
01:59:50.216,01:59:53.286,...picking up the pieces and starting over.
01:59:54.554,01:59:58.524,Freeing yourself up for something better in the future.
02:00:00.359,02:00:03.296,Maybe the happy ending is just...
02:00:03.763,02:00:05.698,...moving on.
02:00:09.535,02:00:12.905,"Baby, what are you doing? It's our turn. Forget the dip. Come on, come on."
02:00:13.239,02:00:15.274,"MAN: Let's go, Alex."
02:00:15.408,02:00:16.909,"Come on, Alex, your turn."
02:00:17.243,02:00:18.444,Ready? LOL.
02:00:18.578,02:00:20.880,Laugh out loud! We won!
02:00:21.214,02:00:26.919,GIGI: Or maybe the happy ending is this: Knowing that through all the unreturned phone calls and broken hearts...
02:00:27.253,02:00:30.656,...through all the blunders and misread signals...
02:00:30.790,02:00:33.793,...through all of the pain and embarrassment...
02:00:33.926,02:00:37.797,"...you never, ever gave up hope."
02:00:45.004,02:00:46.672,NEIL: Now that we are married....
02:00:46.806,02:00:48.007,BETH: We're gonna move.
02:00:48.341,02:00:50.309,Gonna move. That's one thing we're gonna do.
02:00:50.443,02:00:54.447,Another thing we're gonna do is move a little further away from....
02:00:54.580,02:00:57.416,-Baltimore? -Your sisters.

02:00:59.986,02:01:04.991,"I've started trying to figure out what I wanna do, who I wanna be, you know?"
02:01:05.324,02:01:08.828,"Probably seems the wrong time to do that, but why not? You know, why not?"
02:01:08.961,02:01:10.429,Better later than never.
02:01:10.563,02:01:12.331,I'm dating now.
02:01:14.567,02:01:17.270,MAN: What do you miss most about marriage?
02:01:17.403,02:01:18.771,Have you been married?
02:01:18.904,02:01:19.972,"MAN: Yes, I'm married."
02:01:20.306,02:01:21.807,-You are married? MAN: I am married.
02:01:21.941,02:01:23.809,And what's your question?

02:01:27.947,02:01:30.750,"I like him, I'll say that L word."
02:01:30.883,02:01:33.853,"That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah."
02:01:33.986,02:01:37.323,"-I like her a lot, so.... -Good, I'm glad."
02:01:39.859,02:01:42.461,"ANNA: You know, what I've been focusing my energy on..."
02:01:42.595,02:01:46.465,"...is like a self-discovery, as opposed to dating."
02:01:46.599,02:01:48.934,I don't know. Maybe dating's a little overrated.
02:01:49.068,02:01:53.873,Good friend of mine and I are going to India for a few months.
02:01:54.006,02:01:55.541,We're going on a yoga retreat.
02:01:55.675,02:01:59.912,ALEX: I really genuinely love this person-- He had asked me to co-host this party...
02:02:00.046,02:02:01.447,...and I stayed after.
02:02:01.580,02:02:05.351,I was trying to help you out because there was this girl who would not leave...
02:02:05.484,02:02:08.054,-...that tall girl. -Right. She was gross.
02:02:08.387,02:02:11.691,I was trying to-- She was-- Come on.
