00:01:48.525,00:01:51.486,Sorry. I have an appointment. I don't like to be late.
00:01:51.570,00:01:54.197,"Well, would you rather be late or dead?"
00:01:55.741,00:01:58.243,You don't wanna do this. Step out of the car.
00:02:06.668,00:02:08.003,Whoo!
00:02:08.087,00:02:12.382,"Let's go, fellas! Come on, baby! Yeah!"
00:02:12.466,00:02:14.969,Take it easy. The car's brand-new.
00:02:15.052,00:02:16.971,"No problem, buddy. I got this."
00:02:17.054,00:02:20.474,"-Baby, let's ride! Time to go! -Let's get to the club, baby!"
00:02:20.557,00:02:22.309,Your parents know the kind of company you're keeping?
00:02:22.392,00:02:24.979,-Shut up! -Dog!
00:02:25.062,00:02:27.314,"-This shit ain't workin', man! -It's coded."
00:02:27.397,00:02:29.524,"-What's the code, man? -I'm afraid I can't give you that."
00:02:29.608,00:02:31.944,"Well, I'm afraid we'll have to beat it out of you. Let's get out of this car!"
00:02:32.027,00:02:33.988,"Get out of the car, nigga! Come on, man."
00:02:34.071,00:02:36.865,"What you got for me, player? What you got? Kick your ass!"
00:02:36.949,00:02:39.242,"Come on, baby! Mm-hmm!"
00:02:39.326,00:02:41.120,Hold on.
00:02:41.662,00:02:43.497,Just came out of the dry cleaners.
00:03:07.021,00:03:08.730,"Stop moving, or I will shoot you!"
00:03:09.106,00:03:10.398,Don't you have homework to do?
00:03:13.861,00:03:17.072,Why don't you go and do it? Okay. I'm sorry.
00:03:21.451,00:03:23.328,Late.
00:04:32.231,00:04:39.571,"Hey, hey-- -The game! The game! The game! -What's the first rule when entering a man's car?"
00:04:40.572,00:04:42.950,"Respect a man's car, a man respects you."
00:04:43.366,00:04:45.911,-Rule number two? -Greet the man.
00:04:45.994,00:04:48.663,"Good afternoon, Frank. Good afternoon, Jack."
00:04:48.872,00:04:52.500,-Can we play the game now? -I think your brain would be tired after a day of school.
00:04:52.626,00:04:54.294,You're just afraid I'm gonna win.
00:04:54.586,00:04:56.546,I'm afraid you're gonna be too worn out to do your homework.
00:04:56.755,00:04:59.133,It's Friday. I don't have any homework.
00:04:59.424,00:05:01.342,"-In that case, the game. -Yes!"
00:05:01.760,00:05:03.929,"But first, what's the third rule of the car?"
00:05:05.639,00:05:06.932,Good.
00:05:23.240,00:05:27.202,"For five points-- I'm white, I'm round, but I'm not always around."
00:05:28.578,00:05:31.248,A tennis ball? Tennis balls are yellow.
00:05:48.389,00:05:50.433,Sometimes a slice of me is all you'll know.
00:05:50.767,00:05:52.769,A loaf of bread? No.
00:05:58.317,00:06:00.485,Three points. Sometimes I'm light.
00:06:00.568,00:06:02.321,Sometimes I'm dark. Sometimes I'm both.
00:06:02.529,00:06:04.281,-I know! A lightbulb! -No.
00:06:04.614,00:06:06.783,-A pizza! -No.
00:07:08.595,00:07:11.223,Audrey. Audrey! Stop walking away from me.
00:07:15.060,00:07:29.657,"Just wait. I've got about two and a half-- Last clue for all the points. Everyone wants to walk on me, but only a happy few ever have."
00:07:30.075,00:07:32.035,Take your time.
00:07:40.377,00:07:43.838,"Hey, bud. Shh! Mom, it's the game. I'm trying to think."
00:07:43.922,00:07:45.882,"Sorry. Hey, Frank. How are you today?"
00:07:46.300,00:07:49.261,"-Well, Mrs. Billings. -Frank, can I team up with Mom?"
00:07:49.719,00:07:52.389,-I don't know. It's not in the rules. -Come on.
00:07:52.472,00:07:54.849,What's the point in having rules if you can't bend 'em?
00:07:55.016,00:07:57.018,Okay. Just this once.
00:07:59.229,00:08:01.231,Give me some clues.
00:08:01.315,00:08:03.733,"It's round, but not always around."
00:08:03.817,00:08:06.903,It's light sometimes. It's dark sometimes. It's both sometimes.
00:08:06.987,00:08:10.449,"Everyone wants to walk on it, but only a happy few ever have."
00:08:10.740,00:08:12.993,Hmm. That is a hard one.
00:08:13.076,00:08:15.120,Tell me about it.
00:08:19.499,00:08:21.584,-Correct. -Whoo!
00:08:21.668,00:08:23.253,Good job. Good job. All right. Come on.
00:08:23.670,00:08:25.839,"-See you Monday. -Bye, Frank. Thanks."
00:08:25.922,00:08:28.508,"-Keep your snacks in the kitchen. -Bye, Mom!"
00:08:28.967,00:08:31.678,"Hey, he's really taken to you in the month you've been with us."
00:08:31.970,00:08:33.430,Likewise.
00:08:33.513,00:08:37.058,It's too bad you can't stay on after Tony gets back. It was just a favor.
00:08:37.517,00:08:39.353,I don't usually do this sort of a job.
00:08:39.727,00:08:42.730,I thought you were a professional driver?
00:08:42.856,00:08:44.774,A different kind of driving.
00:08:47.194,00:08:50.030,"Well, we're all gonna miss you when you're gone."
00:08:58.163,00:09:02.000,And... thank you for what you did.
00:09:02.125,00:09:04.752,For what?
00:09:04.836,00:09:07.547,For turning the car around so that Jack wouldn't have to see us fighting.
00:09:09.383,00:09:12.927,"-You really know kids, don't you? -I know fighting."
00:09:13.470,00:09:19.518,"He hasn't seen Jack in months. And then when he gets back here, all I can hear is what I'm doing wrong?"
00:09:19.600,00:09:21.478,You'd think that after being separated for a year...
00:09:21.561,00:09:30.820,"that he would-- Um, you don't have to hear this. It's okay."
00:09:32.572,00:09:34.991,"For what it's worth, I think you're doin' a great job with Jack."
00:09:35.325,00:09:37.618,Thank you.
00:09:37.702,00:09:43.458,"Anytime I can be of help, if there's anything you need-- That's really sweet of you, Frank."
00:09:43.917,00:09:46.336,I might have to take you up on it.
00:09:49.297,00:09:50.549,"Oh, uh, I almost forgot."
00:09:50.631,00:10:00.058,"I'm supposed to take Jack to the doctor tomorrow morning for his annual checkup, but I'm organizing a surprise party for him, even though his birthday's not until next week."
00:10:03.437,00:10:11.236,"So while I decorate and, um, his friends arrive, I was thinking if you wouldn't mind-- I'll take him. I feel kind of funny cutting into your weekend."
00:10:11.319,00:10:13.988,I'm just picking up a friend at the airport later on in the day.
00:10:14.072,00:10:16.032,Oh. That's nice.
00:10:16.408,00:10:19.327,What is? The guys on security say you're a bit of a loner.
00:10:20.161,00:10:22.956,"Um, so it's just-- it's just nice to hear you have a friend."
00:10:23.206,00:10:26.418,He's not really a friend. He's French.
00:10:28.211,00:10:30.797,I'll call you back.
00:10:31.214,00:10:34.092,"Audrey, I'd like to finish our conversation."
00:10:39.556,00:10:42.350,"Well, if anything comes up between now and then, you have my cell."
00:10:42.517,00:10:44.352,"Nothing will come up, Mrs. Billings."
00:10:44.727,00:10:48.273,Audrey. Audrey.
00:11:18.345,00:11:21.431,"-Yeah, hello? -Confirmed for tomorrow, 9:00 a.m."
00:12:10.230,00:12:14.234,"Tomorrow, 9:00 a.m. Only change-- the driver will be taking him, not the mother."
00:12:14.317,00:12:15.151,Even better.
00:12:34.753,00:12:37.257,"-Is it stable? -Yes, it's stable."
00:12:37.340,00:12:39.509,And the antidote?
00:12:47.350,00:12:49.018,"See you tomorrow, gentlemen."
00:13:01.030,00:13:03.032,"And in other news, the drug enforcement ministers..."
00:13:03.116,00:13:06.911,of six Latin American countries arrived in Miami today for a summit meeting.
00:13:10.373,00:13:12.751,I'm waiting for an express delivery.
00:13:12.833,00:13:14.753,That's what you told me 45 minutes ago.
00:13:17.796,00:13:19.132,Just get me the pizza.
00:13:19.798,00:13:22.135,I'm not paying for that-- Hi.
00:13:22.969,00:13:24.721,Hi.
00:13:28.767,00:13:32.061,"extra olives and extra anchovies, which amounts to 11.95."
00:13:32.562,00:13:35.814,-I hope you're hungry. -You have no idea.
00:13:40.654,00:13:42.489,Mrs. Billings.
00:13:42.656,00:13:46.909,Uh-uh. Audrey. Audrey.
00:13:47.535,00:13:49.579,What are you doin'?
00:13:49.663,00:13:51.706,What does it look like I'm doing?
00:13:51.790,00:13:53.166,"What, you've been drinking?"
00:13:54.250,00:13:55.918,A little.
00:13:58.004,00:14:02.467,You said if I needed anything-- I can't.
00:14:02.592,00:14:05.178,Why? Because of who I am?
00:14:06.053,00:14:07.639,Because of who I am.
00:14:20.735,00:14:22.445,So confused.
00:14:23.988,00:14:25.573,Who isn't?
00:14:36.292,00:14:43.675,"Thank you, Frank, for the time and... the respect."
00:14:45.552,00:14:47.637,I think it's what I needed the most.
00:14:50.223,00:14:52.183,Bye.
00:15:24.841,00:15:27.594,Am I gonna get a shot? I don't know.
00:15:50.366,00:15:52.201,"Geez! Um, we're not open yet."
00:15:52.410,00:15:54.995,It's an emergency. I need to see the doctor immediately.
00:15:55.580,00:15:59.459,"Right. Dr. Koblin, uh, if you'll come out here, please. We have an issue."
00:15:59.709,00:16:02.128,You'll have to fill out some papers stating the medical problem.
00:16:02.462,00:16:05.256,"Actually, my problem's not medical."
00:16:06.048,00:16:08.551,"-It's psychological. -Yes, Laura?"
00:16:08.760,00:16:11.554,-What seems to be the problem? -Me.
00:16:12.806,00:16:14.181,I hate shots.
00:16:15.642,00:16:18.686,Number one: There's no guarantee you're getting a shot.
00:16:19.437,00:16:23.023,So there's no sense in getting all worked up over something that might not happen.
00:16:29.739,00:16:31.783,-Give me the good news. -Doctor said I'm cured.
00:16:32.742,00:16:35.077,"Frank, it hurts a lot."
00:16:35.453,00:16:37.997,I'd never let anyone hurt you a lot. Promise?
00:16:38.164,00:16:41.835,You know my fourth rule? Never make a promise you can't keep.
00:17:04.649,00:17:07.652,May I help you? Jack Billings to see Dr. Koblin.
00:17:08.027,00:17:10.655,I'm sorry. He's out sick today. He'll be seeing Dr. Tyberg.
00:17:11.155,00:17:14.909,-I like Dr. Koblin. -Don't worry. Dr. Tyberg's very nice.
00:17:15.242,00:17:18.872,"-Now, if you'll just take him into room 3. -Where's Miss Laura?"
00:17:19.121,00:17:20.748,-Who? -You're standing at her desk.
00:17:21.123,00:17:22.959,That Miss Laura. She's out sick too.
00:17:23.334,00:17:27.046,"There's a lot of flu going around. Now, come on. Doctor's got a busy day."
00:17:27.505,00:17:30.466,Come on. It'll be over before you know it.
00:17:32.134,00:17:33.845,"Hey, hey!"
00:17:34.888,00:17:37.181,I'm Dr. Tyberg.
00:17:37.515,00:17:38.975,Can't I wait for my doctor?
00:17:39.475,00:17:42.812,"Unfortunately, your doctor was called away on emergency."
00:17:43.145,00:17:45.982,-Your nurse said he had the flu. -That was the emergency.
00:17:46.315,00:17:48.359,He came down with flu very quickly.
00:17:48.442,00:17:51.821,"So, the sooner we start, the sooner we finish."
00:17:52.238,00:17:54.991,Eh? Come. I show you something very cool.
00:17:56.576,00:17:59.954,I'm sorry. Doctor-patient privacy in room.
00:18:00.162,00:18:07.461,"But you can wait in reception area, or glass of water, or-- Hey, trust me. I'm doctor."
00:18:13.009,00:18:15.511,"-Yeah. -Allo, allo."
00:18:15.595,00:18:17.430,"Frank, I'm here."
00:18:20.391,00:18:22.852,Two hours of my vacation just like that.
00:18:23.019,00:18:26.856,"From now on, it's the only way I fly, Frank. Tailwinds or nothing."
00:18:31.360,00:18:33.487,Hello?
00:18:33.571,00:18:36.616,Sorry. Dr. Dunietz is not in today. Call back Monday.
00:18:42.580,00:18:44.290,"Listen, Inspector, I'm a little tied up."
00:18:44.373,00:18:46.417,"You mind taking a cab? You have the address, yes?"
00:18:46.500,00:18:50.671,"Thank you. You know, I heard the fish down here is fantastic."
00:18:50.964,00:18:53.883,"I could make us bouillabaisse. You like bouillabaisse, Frank?"
00:18:56.010,00:18:57.136,I gotta go.
00:18:58.721,00:18:59.764,Frank!
00:18:59.847,00:19:02.892,"You know, maybe it's better if we wait for his regular doctor to come back."
00:19:02.976,00:19:05.478,It's very important that he receives immunizations.
00:19:05.561,00:19:08.314,"Well, I'm sure it is. But a week won't make a difference."
00:19:08.397,00:19:33.589,"No, we're doing-- Keep going, Jack!"
00:20:43.868,00:20:46.537,Look at me. Look at me.
00:20:47.413,00:20:50.332,Remember my promise? Yes.
00:21:10.853,00:21:12.897,-It's me! -Get out!
00:21:17.401,00:21:18.986,Frank.
00:21:48.557,00:21:50.392,Shit!
00:22:16.002,00:22:18.296,Come on! Hurry!
00:22:24.093,00:22:25.886,Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay.
00:22:53.706,00:22:55.916,Freeze! Drop your weapon!
00:22:56.000,00:22:58.085,Get down! Put your guns on the ground!
00:22:58.878,00:23:00.754,-Si. -They got away.
00:23:01.505,00:23:03.590,-God! -Plan B?
00:23:25.487,00:23:28.282,"Oh, you made it. Uh-huh."
00:23:28.824,00:23:31.660,-Aw. What's that? -Jack's birthday present.
00:23:31.744,00:23:34.997,"Baseball uniform, cleats, glove and a bat."
00:23:35.581,00:23:37.415,Whoo-hoo!
00:23:37.499,00:23:40.418,It's his favorite sport. It was last year.
00:23:44.422,00:23:46.384,"You know, you should see him sometime. Hello?"
00:23:48.219,00:23:50.763,"Mr. and Mrs. Billings, they're coming!"
00:23:50.846,00:23:52.430,"Hide, everyone! Hide!"
00:24:02.524,00:24:05.194,"Who is this? Look in your rearview mirror, and you'll see who it is."
00:24:07.696,00:24:10.324,I know what you're thinking. Bulletproof glass.
00:24:10.408,00:24:15.829,"So now you'll tell me, in your experience, which, judging from the little performance you put on back at the office..."
00:24:15.913,00:24:22.795,"goes way beyond just driving children to school and back, does bulletproof glass stop a 7.62 armor-piercing round?"
00:24:23.045,00:24:25.839,"Frank, why did you stop the car?"
00:24:28.968,00:24:33.139,"-Don't bother moving. I've triangulated 300 feet away. -Come on, Frank. Pick up."
00:24:33.389,00:24:36.350,None of this would have been necessary if you had not screwed up my plan.
00:24:36.642,00:24:38.978,"So, now I'm going to tell you how to set things right."
00:24:39.061,00:24:40.980,Someone is going to appear in a few seconds.
00:24:54.243,00:24:55.995,Let her in.
00:25:06.172,00:25:07.798,Good boy. Good boy.
00:25:13.637,00:25:15.681,Hi.
00:25:15.973,00:25:17.975,Leave it on.
00:25:20.269,00:25:22.646,"Personally, I hate kids."
00:25:22.729,00:25:29.236,"Now, I don't know what your feelings are on the subject, but if you ever wanna have any, make no moves but the moves I tell you to make."
00:25:30.779,00:25:32.865,"You're in her hands now, amigo mio."
00:25:32.948,00:25:35.909,"They can be very gentle hands, or they can be the hands from hell."
00:25:36.118,00:25:40.414,"-Trust me on this one. -Trust him on this one. Now, drive!"
00:26:23.541,00:26:24.791,Make a left!
00:26:25.543,00:26:27.086,I said left!
00:26:48.524,00:26:52.652,"Listen, we keep doing this your way, no matter how many rights and lefts we make, they're gonna catch us."
00:26:52.986,00:26:55.697,-Let me do this my way so no one gets hurt. -Where's the fun in that?
00:26:55.781,00:26:57.491,Let's save the fun for later.
00:27:06.375,00:27:08.710,Hey! Look out!
00:28:51.230,00:28:54.400,-Not bad. -Didn't your mother ever teach you to say thank you?
00:28:54.483,00:28:57.069,Yeah. She tried and failed miserably.
00:28:57.152,00:29:00.864,-I think we lost them. -Think again.
00:29:05.744,00:29:08.205,Thought complete. Let's go.
00:29:40.195,00:29:43.490,"He's one man in one car! He's a chauffeur, for Christ's sakes!"
00:29:43.574,00:29:46.702,"Not exactly, sir. We think there's a possibility he may have been in on it."
00:29:46.785,00:29:49.788,-That's impossible. -How would you know?
00:29:49.871,00:29:54.876,"He's been working here for a month. He could've been setting this up the whole time, and you wouldn't have known any different."
00:29:54.960,00:29:59.047,-You are such an expert on knowing people! -His background.
00:29:59.673,00:30:02.426,He's ex-special forces. Head of an elite commando unit for five years...
00:30:02.593,00:30:04.177,specialized in search and destroy.
00:30:04.261,00:30:08.265,"Been in and out of Lebanon, Syria, Sudan. The man is a hunter."
00:30:08.474,00:30:11.143,I don't care what his skills are. I don't care where he's from.
00:30:11.226,00:30:14.146,This is not a war zone! This is an American city!
00:30:14.229,00:30:16.231,Where's my son?
00:30:44.176,00:30:46.094,Last stop. All out.
00:30:49.598,00:30:51.057,You're quite a guy.
00:30:51.684,00:30:57.397,"Another time, another place, you and me, baby, the pleasure we could have."
00:31:03.821,00:31:05.280,Beauty.
00:31:06.072,00:31:07.407,Frank.
00:31:09.618,00:31:11.161,Frank!
00:31:15.040,00:31:17.710,Not what you expected when you reported for work this morning.
00:31:17.793,00:31:19.795,"Is it, Frank? No?"
00:31:19.878,00:31:22.297,Is that what passes for wit in this circle?
00:31:25.217,00:31:27.093,wit is not a requirement of the job.
00:31:27.177,00:31:28.887,"Brutality, yes."
00:31:28.970,00:31:31.557,"An ability to inflict pain, absolutely."
00:31:31.640,00:31:36.311,"A certain psychotic, moral ignorance, blind obedience--all required."
00:31:37.020,00:31:39.105,But not wit. How was it?
00:31:39.189,00:31:41.358,"Fun. Only the beginning, my love."
00:31:43.569,00:31:45.362,What's this all about?
00:31:45.529,00:31:47.614,A timely question. Max?
00:31:59.167,00:32:00.627,Hello?
00:32:00.711,00:32:03.255,Put me on the speaker so you don't have to repeat the instructions.
00:32:03.672,00:32:07.551,"In the next two hours, you'll get five million dollars in nonsequential 100-dollar bills."
00:32:07.760,00:32:09.428,You put them in a waterproof suitcase.
00:32:09.511,00:32:11.889,You go to the Bayfront Park personally.
00:32:11.971,00:32:14.099,There will be a blue Chrysler parked on the sand.
00:32:14.391,00:32:16.643,"You place the suitcase in the trunk, and you leave."
00:32:16.727,00:32:19.312,I don't know if I can get five million dollars in two hours.
00:32:19.396,00:32:21.481,"Mr. Billings, please. I read the newspapers."
00:32:21.565,00:32:25.819,"The day you were appointed to your current position, your net worth exceeded 100 million dollars."
00:32:25.903,00:32:27.821,"So, you won't even feel the bite."
00:32:28.113,00:32:31.491,What guarantee do I have that you won't harm my son?
00:32:34.912,00:32:37.205,I'm not a car dealer. Don't let the charming accent...
00:32:37.289,00:32:40.083,"and my grammatical, impeccable syntax mislead you."
00:32:40.166,00:32:42.085,"I live in the jungle, and in the jungle..."
00:32:42.168,00:32:44.254,you either eat or be eaten.
00:32:44.337,00:32:47.006,"But in the spirit of doing business, here is the guarantee."
00:32:47.090,00:32:50.719,"Ten minutes past the deadline, if the money doesn't arrive, I send a finger."
00:32:51.094,00:32:54.097,"Twenty minutes, a hand. Thirty minutes, a foot."
00:32:55.056,00:32:57.142,"Sounds like we have a deal, don't we, Mr. Billings?"
00:32:57.225,00:32:59.102,You have a deal.
00:33:01.480,00:33:03.941,Could we please speak to our son?
00:33:05.191,00:33:07.569,Mommy! Mommy!
00:33:08.612,00:33:12.908,"You have two hours, Mr. Billings, starting now."
00:33:22.584,00:33:24.294,You promised!
00:33:24.377,00:33:27.005,"Never make promises you can't keep, my friend."
00:33:27.088,00:33:30.133,I don't. It's one of my rules.
00:33:30.509,00:33:32.845,Wow! Bravo!
00:33:33.720,00:33:36.682,A man who lives his life by the rules.
00:33:36.765,00:33:39.977,"Well, in my world, rules are meant to be broken. Not in mine."
00:33:40.435,00:33:43.730,"This time, you're gonna have to make an exception. Go."
00:34:12.885,00:34:14.511,Prego.
00:34:27.024,00:34:29.067,"-Go. -Hey, driver!"
00:34:32.278,00:34:35.407,"No, no. Wait, wait. A little distance between us isn't a bad thing."
00:34:37.910,00:34:39.786,¡Andiamo!
00:34:48.712,00:34:49.922,Now.
00:35:25.498,00:35:27.584,"Hold on. No, hang on. Wait for the signal."
00:35:27.751,00:35:29.461,-Hello? -It's me.
00:35:29.544,00:35:31.755,"We've got something here, gentlemen. You son of a bitch!"
00:35:31.838,00:35:33.715,"Look, I had nothing to do with this."
00:35:33.799,00:35:37.427,"One scratch on his head, one hair out of place-- Let me speak to who's in charge."
00:35:37.510,00:35:39.972,"-Hello, Frank? This is U.S. Marshal Stappleton. -You have to act fast."
00:35:40.055,00:35:42.724,-There are three boats. -Just tell us where you are.
00:35:42.808,00:35:45.268,Get a plane up over the Intracoastal. They're heading north.
00:35:45.351,00:35:47.938,Just tell me where you are. Just tell us where you are!
00:35:48.229,00:35:50.816,"-Hello, Frank? -Got it."
00:36:21.429,00:36:23.181,"Tarconi, it's me. Get out of the house."
00:36:23.348,00:36:27.853,"No. I was just prepping the madeleines, and-- Forget the madeleines. Just get out."
00:36:27.936,00:36:30.563,-And go where? -Anywhere. The beach. Go to the beach.
00:36:30.647,00:36:35.777,"Oh, the beach. Oh, the famous Miami Beach. Oh, my dream!"
00:36:35.861,00:36:38.071,I would love to go to the beach.
00:36:44.243,00:36:46.913,-Who the fuck are you? -I'm the cook.
00:36:49.332,00:36:52.502,Oh! It's a mistake! A terrible mistake!
00:36:54.337,00:36:58.299,Why we can't all just get along?
00:36:58.383,00:37:00.052,You know?
00:37:15.233,00:37:17.443,-Hello? -It's Frank. Don't hang up.
00:37:17.527,00:37:19.362,Pretend it's someone else.
00:37:21.489,00:37:23.158,"Hi, Susan."
00:37:23.950,00:37:25.827,"Uh, no, I'm just here at home."
00:37:26.536,00:37:29.789,"I didn't do it, Audrey. She had a gun on Jack. I had no choice."
00:37:30.040,00:37:31.708,"Yeah, I saw that."
00:37:33.418,00:37:35.712,-What do you know? -It's more than a kidnapping.
00:37:35.795,00:37:37.547,They called and asked for a ransom.
00:37:37.630,00:37:40.092,The doctors there were fake. They were trying to give Jack a shot...
00:37:40.341,00:37:42.094,when I interrupted them.
00:37:45.555,00:37:48.266,"Audrey, I promised Jack I wouldn't let anyone hurt him."
00:37:48.600,00:37:51.186,I'm not gonna break that promise. Frank?
00:37:51.519,00:37:52.729,I'll call you back.
00:37:56.066,00:37:57.734,Audrey?
00:37:58.526,00:37:59.903,Is everything all right?
00:38:00.445,00:38:03.364,"That's a pretty stupid question to ask right now, don't you think, Jeff?"
00:38:15.418,00:38:19.214,why you didn't immediately identify yourself as a police officer.
00:38:21.216,00:38:25.929,"Oh. I was, uh, overwhelmed by the effectiveness of your operation..."
00:38:26.930,00:38:29.099,and the sophistication of your equipment.
00:38:29.182,00:38:32.852,"You know, I work in a small office in small town."
00:38:33.019,00:38:35.021,We only have small crimes.
00:38:35.105,00:38:37.023,"I must admit, I was a little insecure."
00:38:37.107,00:38:39.067,"And you and Frank Martin are friends, right?"
00:38:39.151,00:38:42.612,"A friend? Oh, I wouldn't say exactly a friend."
00:38:42.695,00:38:45.031,I know him. We have a relationship.
00:38:45.115,00:38:47.993,A long relationship? Not so long.
00:38:48.076,00:38:50.870,But they found you cookin' in his house! I'm French!
00:38:50.954,00:38:52.664,-So? -We don't need to know someone...
00:38:52.747,00:38:54.833,for a long time in order to cook for them.
00:38:54.916,00:38:58.336,"It's our way of breaking the ice. Take, for example, you."
00:39:02.590,00:39:05.468,"You will pardon me to think so, but it's not very good."
00:39:05.551,00:39:08.471,"Yeah, I know. It sucks. But what does that got to do with anything?"
00:39:08.638,00:39:10.389,Do you have a kitchen?
00:39:11.599,00:39:13.643,Stay back. Stay back.
00:40:39.478,00:40:40.939,Don't move!
00:40:41.022,00:40:43.316,Smith! Drop it.
00:40:53.118,00:40:54.535,Fuck!
00:40:54.994,00:40:56.955,Aah!
00:41:08.049,00:41:10.676,I just found this.
00:41:10.760,00:41:12.637,"Oh, Jesus!"
00:41:12.720,00:41:14.639,What happened? We'll take care of it for you.
00:41:25.691,00:41:27.444,We got you covered.
00:41:37.203,00:41:44.085,"As my mother used to say, A meal is only limited by your imagination. Hmm!"
00:41:44.169,00:41:45.795,That's creme brulee and croque monsieur.
00:41:45.878,00:41:47.505,Cream brulee. Crème brulee.
00:41:47.588,00:41:49.882,Croque monsieur. Croque monsieur.
00:41:54.512,00:41:57.849,-Cooking. -Cooking? Can you talk?
00:41:58.141,00:42:01.436,Speak of the devil. My mother. Mom!
00:42:01.602,00:42:05.440,"Please, um, do you mind? Thank you."
00:42:13.156,00:42:14.699,May I ask who you're cooking for?
00:42:15.158,00:42:17.035,For the U.S. marshals.
00:42:17.118,00:42:19.954,"But once they found my badge, they were very polite."
00:42:20.330,00:42:22.707,They gave me coffee and a sandwich.
00:42:22.790,00:42:25.251,"You wouldn't believe what passes for food in this place, Frank."
00:42:25.584,00:42:27.420,But I'm correcting the situation...
00:42:27.504,00:42:30.340,while they wait for my chief to call back and confirm everything.
00:42:31.132,00:42:35.261,"Of course, that might take a while. He's never there."
00:42:35.887,00:42:39.516,-Anything about me? -Yes. They are very interested about you.
00:42:39.598,00:42:43.520,They want to know where you are. Where are you?
00:42:43.811,00:42:45.980,"Nowhere for very long. Listen, hold on."
00:42:50.985,00:42:52.487,Do you have access to a computer?
00:42:53.738,00:42:57.158,It's years since having access to something decent.
00:43:12.631,00:43:15.176,Oh. Handsome fellow. Who is he?
00:43:15.260,00:43:17.554,That's what I need to know. Do they have an I.D. program?
00:43:17.636,00:43:20.265,"You'll forgive me, but I'm not so used to this system."
00:43:20.348,00:43:23.226,"Back home, there is one computer for 10 of us."
00:43:23.518,00:43:25.853,"So, how is it with you, Frank?"
00:43:25.937,00:43:28.189,It's a complicated story.
00:43:28.273,00:43:30.775,"You mean, you are in the shit? You might say that."
00:43:30.858,00:43:33.361,"In other words, you're not arrested."
00:43:33.445,00:43:37.323,Ah! Voila. A Russian biologist...
00:43:37.407,00:43:42.161,with advanced degrees from the state laboratory for biological warfare in Siberia.
00:43:42.245,00:43:45.123,-Do we have an address? -Miami Park West.
00:43:45.206,00:43:47.666,"King Street, number 11."
00:45:59.215,00:46:00.925,Hey!
00:46:04.387,00:46:07.139,What are you doing? Trying to catch a bus.
00:46:10.685,00:46:12.562,Come on!
00:46:27.910,00:46:31.539,"What are you doing, driver? Not so good on the water, huh?"
00:46:54.979,00:46:56.981,Hit the ground!
00:47:08.785,00:47:11.412,Okay. Okay. Tell me about the doctor's office.
00:47:11.496,00:47:14.831,What doctor's office? The one where you tried to stick the kid with this.
00:47:26.885,00:47:30.264,Do you know what you have done? Do you know what you have done?
00:47:30.473,00:47:35.687,"Obviously something not conducive to your good health, which is all I needed to know in the first place."
00:47:35.978,00:47:39.691,Have a good life. What's left of it.
00:47:55.707,00:47:58.334,Outpost to Base. The ransom is still there.
00:47:58.417,00:48:01.878,Thanks. The ransom still hasn't been picked up.
00:48:01.962,00:48:04.549,-What does that mean? -Don't worry. Right now it means nothing.
00:48:04.632,00:48:07.802,-What if it's not a kidnapping? -I've worked with over 15 kidnapping cases in two years.
00:48:07.884,00:48:10.680,"You think that if they don't take the ransom, I'm gonna get my son back?"
00:48:10.763,00:48:13.890,"Audrey, don't make this any more complicated than it already is."
00:48:13.974,00:48:17.936,"I'm not making this complicated, Jefferson. It's because of your job."
00:48:18.020,00:48:19.896,What does my job have to do with any of this?
00:48:19.980,00:48:22.107,It has everything to do with it.
00:48:22.191,00:48:25.486,"Don't you understand? Because you became famous, we became the targets."
00:48:25.570,00:48:30.324,"And no matter what any of you all think, the only one who's out there trying to get Jack back is Frank."
00:48:30.408,00:48:34.495,Frank? The chauffeur? You spoke with Frank Martin and didn't tell us about it?
00:48:34.579,00:48:38.332,-What the hell are you doing talking to him? -Because he saw Jack alive!
00:49:08.987,00:49:10.907,-Hard drive blew. -Get another one in there.
00:49:10.989,00:49:13.743,"-Yes, sir. -How long is it gonna take?"
00:49:13.826,00:49:15.745,"Ma'am, we're going as fast as we can."
00:49:15.828,00:49:17.954,"He can suffocate in there! Ma'am, stay calm."
00:49:18.038,00:49:20.541,"It's my son! Audrey, let them work."
00:49:20.625,00:49:23.335,"-Are you just gonna sit there and do nothing? -Audrey, they're experts!"
00:49:23.419,00:49:25.880,Everyone is an expert! I've had it with all of you!
00:49:27.548,00:49:29.007,Audrey!
00:49:32.428,00:49:36.140,Audrey! Audrey!
00:49:40.937,00:49:42.897,Audrey!
00:49:49.986,00:49:52.114,Jack!
00:49:52.490,00:49:54.283,Are you okay?
00:49:59.831,00:50:01.582,"Here you go, little buddy."
00:50:11.926,00:50:13.636,I wish.
00:50:49.964,00:50:53.175,Tipov! No! Shit! Shit!
00:50:53.258,00:50:55.720,"Dimitri, you scared shit in me!"
00:50:55.803,00:50:57.471,Where is Sonavitch? He's in chamber.
00:50:57.555,00:50:59.765,I need to speak with him. He won't be long.
00:50:59.849,00:51:02.643,Sit down! Listen Panasonic.
00:51:02.727,00:51:05.354,It's rock music. It's good.
00:52:43.828,00:52:45.913,What was that? I don't know.
00:52:46.246,00:52:47.957,Shit!
00:52:48.791,00:52:50.960,-What are you doing here? -I need antidote.
00:52:51.209,00:52:54.296,The driver--He inject me with virus. Look.
00:52:54.379,00:52:56.507,"Dimitri, where would he get the virus?"
00:52:56.674,00:52:58.884,The one we left in doctor's surgery.
00:52:59.093,00:53:01.637,"Please, I need antidote. I am sick."
00:53:01.720,00:53:06.100,Calm down. You're not sick. You have four hours before the virus is active.
00:53:06.475,00:53:08.602,You know that. You worked on creating it.
00:53:09.937,00:53:18.320,Open fridge. I'm telling you-- Open the fridge!
00:53:19.071,00:53:22.741,Please. Insurance policy. How many do you have?
00:53:22.825,00:53:25.494,Two doses. Enough for Tipov and myself.
00:53:29.456,00:53:31.917,Tipov's policy canceled. There is one for me.
00:53:33.335,00:53:36.421,And I want it now. Come on! Come on!
00:53:37.798,00:53:39.633,Let's do it!
00:53:40.885,00:53:42.887,-Let's not. -Who are you?
00:53:42.970,00:53:45.097,"-Driver, there is enough for two of us. -You don't need it."
00:53:45.181,00:53:47.183,-But you injected me! -With water.
00:53:47.683,00:53:49.225,I'm not sick?
00:53:49.309,00:53:51.227,Not sick. Water?
00:53:53.981,00:53:56.274,Son of bitch!
00:53:58.986,00:54:02.238,Good. The problem is solved. One dose for each of us.
00:54:02.322,00:54:05.534,"It's not for us. Ah, one for you; one for the child."
00:54:05.784,00:54:09.329,Your devotion is touching. My patience is about to run out.
00:54:14.210,00:54:16.378,Tell me about the virus. Okay.
00:54:16.837,00:54:19.548,"What do you want to know? Everything. For starters, what is it?"
00:54:19.631,00:54:23.219,It's a recombinant retro-immune double-polymorphing effluent.
00:54:23.301,00:54:26.262,The child will die. Anyone he breathes on will die.
00:54:26.638,00:54:28.599,"And then it's over. What do you mean, it's over?"
00:54:28.849,00:54:32.144,The virus is designed to go inert after 24 hours.
00:54:36.356,00:54:38.817,"You really want to play superhero, don't you?"
00:54:38.901,00:54:41.946,"Well, let's see if you can fly."
00:55:18.523,00:55:20.484,You okay? I'm okay.
00:56:25.216,00:56:27.092,There's nothing to worry about.
00:56:27.176,00:56:31.055,It's just a simple viral infection combined with the stress of what happened.
00:56:31.138,00:56:34.058,It should pass in a day or two. I gave him something to help him sleep.
00:56:37.061,00:56:39.021,"Thank you. Thank you, Doctor."
00:56:40.981,00:56:47.654,"You know, Audrey, all of this has-- Well, it's made me realize what a fool I've been..."
00:56:48.822,00:56:52.243,with Jack... and with you.
00:57:03.670,00:57:06.173,I'd like to come by after the conference.
00:57:06.715,00:57:10.802,Check on Jack. Check on you.
00:57:14.390,00:57:16.808,Good. I'll see you soon.
00:57:17.851,00:57:19.937,They're here if you need them.
00:57:31.823,00:57:34.285,"-You all right, ma'am? -I'm fine."
00:57:41.792,00:57:43.961,"Are you okay, Mrs. Billings? Go to your bedroom."
00:57:44.044,00:57:46.463,"Hi, Susan. How are you?"
00:57:48.632,00:57:51.051,"I'm alone. Where are you, Frank?"
00:57:52.010,00:57:53.845,Turn around.
00:58:05.899,00:58:08.402,It was a kidnapping. Jack is fine.
00:58:08.485,00:58:10.612,"Jack's been infected with a deadly virus, Audrey."
00:58:10.695,00:58:13.157,Now anyone who comes into contact with him will die.
00:58:13.698,00:58:15.993,What are you telling me?
00:58:16.910,00:58:19.037,Are you telling me that my son is gonna die?
00:58:19.579,00:58:21.498,"No, he's not."
00:58:23.667,00:58:28.005,"Once incubated, the virus becomes airborne, so anyone he breathes on gets infected."
00:58:28.088,00:58:30.841,Your son was a weapon. The target is his father.
00:58:30.924,00:58:33.218,"Jefferson? Well, why?"
00:58:33.302,00:58:36.096,Because of the conference. It's the only logical answer.
00:58:36.554,00:58:39.557,Every drug enforcement agency in the hemisphere in one room.
00:58:39.766,00:58:42.311,Your husband breathes; the room dies.
00:58:48.275,00:58:50.110,"You gotta trust me, Audrey."
00:58:58.369,00:59:01.705,Can you get to him? What are you gonna do?
00:59:02.247,00:59:05.042,Find the guy responsible. He has more of this.
00:59:06.460,00:59:10.047,For you and everybody else. For you now.
00:59:28.106,00:59:30.150,We have a guest.
00:59:30.817,00:59:33.362,You're burnin' up. I'm okay.
00:59:34.654,00:59:35.906,You gotta go. Go.
01:00:26.790,01:00:29.209,Is the governor here? Everybody's gonna be here.
01:00:34.506,01:00:36.841,-You can't go to the conference. -Is everything all right?
01:00:39.677,01:00:43.056,"-I can't hear you. I'm inside. -Now I've got it, and so do you."
01:00:43.181,01:00:46.643,"-Audrey, I can't hear you. -Their plan is to infect everyone at the conference."
01:00:46.726,01:00:48.770,-I'm gonna have to call you back. -Jeff!
01:00:54.610,01:00:56.653,I'm all right. Come on. You sure?
01:00:56.736,01:00:59.239,Yeah. Okay.
01:01:18.883,01:01:21.386,-Allo. -You still a guest of the government?
01:01:21.678,01:01:25.015,They gave me the five-star accommodation.
01:01:25.890,01:01:28.852,-Let me guess. You need my help? -Are you near the computer?
01:01:30.228,01:01:31.813,It's practically my pillow.
01:01:31.896,01:01:34.732,"So, how do you want to start? I don't know. I have nothing."
01:01:35.066,01:01:38.987,"Ah, my favorite type of investigation."
01:01:40.364,01:01:41.615,Let's see.
01:01:44.117,01:01:47.745,I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to my delegates.
01:01:47.912,01:01:50.582,"Breathe. That's right. Breathe, my friend. Breathe."
01:01:52.459,01:01:56.004,"Tomorrow, once these bastards are out of the way..."
01:01:56.087,01:02:00.967,"and their cooperation agreements are dead and buried, you know what the biggest problem is going to be?"
01:02:01.343,01:02:03.303,What? Counting the money.
01:02:08.559,01:02:11.061,"I can't wait for tomorrow. Ay, ay, ay!"
01:02:12.145,01:02:14.398,It's easier with you.
01:02:15.773,01:02:18.860,"Ahhh, Gianni Chellini."
01:02:18.943,01:02:23.532,"He hires himself out to anyone looking to make trouble-- Red Brigades, Shining Path."
01:02:26.076,01:02:28.579,Someone accessed the database on the 15th floor.
01:02:29.580,01:02:32.040,That's Gonzalez. He's on vacation.
01:02:34.125,01:02:38.547,"Ah, he was behind the hostage taking of the public ministers in Geneva."
01:02:39.590,01:02:41.258,That was a nice piece of work.
01:02:46.179,01:02:50.475,"-Give me an address. -Miami, East Island, Pelican Drive, number 26900."
01:02:50.684,01:02:53.228,"-We found the car. -You're one great cop, Tarconi."
01:02:53.311,01:02:55.397,"Ah, thank you for the compliment."
01:02:55.689,01:02:57.815,Now I'm going back to sleep.
01:03:00.527,01:03:02.820,Hmm. Maybe not.
01:03:07.743,01:03:10.621,-Move over. -What do you--Sure!
01:03:11.162,01:03:14.124,This is the second gun in my car tonight.
01:03:18.712,01:03:20.213,Mommy?
01:03:20.297,01:03:22.758,Hmm? Honey.
01:03:23.216,01:03:25.469,You feeling better? A little bit.
01:03:26.970,01:03:28.972,"Why don't you try to go back to sleep, okay?"
01:03:36.229,01:03:38.022,"Ma'am, are you all right?"
01:04:55.809,01:04:57.435,"Okay, do it."
01:05:10.281,01:05:13.785,"What are you doing? You know, last night got me thinking."
01:05:14.661,01:05:16.663,How do you transport the antidote safely?
01:05:17.414,01:05:23.336,"We need something that won't break, something that can't be stolen, something totally secure."
01:05:23.920,01:05:25.338,Me.
01:05:31.386,01:05:32.929,Impressive.
01:05:33.346,01:05:34.848,Get dressed.
01:05:36.558,01:05:38.435,Stop him.
01:05:40.228,01:05:42.647,-These your friends? -Not yet.
01:05:56.035,01:05:58.622,I'm out of ammo. Me too.
01:05:58.705,01:06:00.791,So am I. Where are the reloads?
01:06:00.874,01:06:02.292,The garage.
01:06:03.710,01:06:06.212,"Check the house! Go, go, go!"
01:06:10.592,01:06:12.427,Forget the ammo! Get him!
01:07:48.231,01:07:50.984,-What you want me to do? -Keep the meter running.
01:07:51.651,01:07:55.071,"Fine. Don't worry, baby."
01:07:55.405,01:07:58.616,Safe now. You're safe. You're so beautiful.
01:07:58.700,01:08:01.118,Remind me of my yellow poom-poom rider.
01:09:17.737,01:09:19.280,Don't move.
01:09:19.823,01:09:22.450,"Oh, Mr. Driver. I'll blow you into tomorrow."
01:09:23.118,01:09:25.161,But then I'd bleed what you came for all over the floor.
01:09:25.244,01:09:27.080,"You wouldn't want this, would you?"
01:09:27.163,01:09:30.541,Not after you worked so hard trying to get to the antidote.
01:09:31.001,01:09:35.046,"Take a good look, Frank Martin. I'm a cure for what ails you."
01:09:35.130,01:09:37.340,I'm the only cure for what ails you.
01:09:40.677,01:09:43.972,But nice try. I'm impressed. Didn't give you enough credit.
01:09:44.055,01:09:46.641,Took more than a driver to figure this out.
01:09:46.724,01:09:49.268,I haven't figured it all out yet. Perhaps I can help you.
01:09:49.352,01:09:51.813,What part are you a little-- how you say--thick on?
01:09:52.271,01:09:54.273,You. Why?
01:09:54.357,01:09:56.776,"Ah, well, that's the easy part."
01:09:56.860,01:09:59.278,"It's a business deal, pure and simple."
01:09:59.445,01:10:01.656,I'm for hire to the highest bidder.
01:10:01.906,01:10:05.284,"And in this case, the highest bidder was the Colombian cocaine cartels..."
01:10:05.368,01:10:08.746,that wanted these pesky little men off their backs.
01:10:08.913,01:10:12.208,You really think killing all these politicians is gonna make things easier for them?
01:10:12.291,01:10:15.920,That's not my problem. I was hired to do a job.
01:10:16.087,01:10:20.257,"I did the job, like you. Just... my pay is better."
01:10:21.843,01:10:24.054,My hair and my suit too.
01:10:26.681,01:10:28.641,"Mm, Lola."
01:10:28.725,01:10:32.269,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a plane to catch."
01:10:33.229,01:10:35.065,Kill him.
01:10:35.815,01:10:36.983,"Ciao, ciao."
01:10:42.697,01:10:44.824,-What's in this for you? -Pleasure.
01:10:48.494,01:10:50.329,In killing you.
01:12:27.426,01:12:33.975,"We're coming to you live from the Key Biscayne Causeway, where at least 10 police cars are in hot pursuit of a stolen red pickup truck."
01:12:38.938,01:12:41.983,"Oh, my! This is just not-- Jim, are you getting that?"
01:12:42.066,01:12:46.362,There's another car that is swaying past the police as if it were standing still.
01:12:47.363,01:12:50.658,"Son of a bitch can drive. Whoo. Yes, he can."
01:13:36.913,01:13:39.790,"We have clearance for takeoff, Mr. Chellini."
01:13:39.874,01:13:42.835,"Sit back, enjoy your flight, and we will be in Colombia before you know it."
01:14:28.881,01:14:30.841,We have a problem with the landing gear. It won't come up.
01:14:30.925,01:14:33.261,I'm turning back to land. Can we fly with the problem?
01:14:33.344,01:14:36.973,"-Yeah, theoretically. -Then you'll land when we get to Colombia."
01:14:38.433,01:14:40.810,Go and see if you can lift it manually.
01:14:41.436,01:14:44.355,"Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Chellini. Nothing to worry about."
01:14:49.902,01:14:51.737,Sorry. Flight's been canceled.
01:14:56.409,01:14:58.411,Have a seat.
01:14:59.829,01:15:01.289,Relax.
01:15:02.706,01:15:05.960,"Drink something, and let's get to know each other."
01:15:06.085,01:15:09.380,I think I know everything I need to know.
01:16:55.611,01:16:57.572,Shit!
01:18:40.299,01:18:43.802,"skin but no hair, it's white inside and brown outside?"
01:18:43.886,01:18:45.971,Mom? A worm?
01:18:46.055,01:18:49.392,-Wrong. Dad? -A caterpillar.
01:18:49.475,01:18:51.185,Wrong.
01:18:51.268,01:18:53.729,A potato.
01:18:56.691,01:18:58.317,May I help you?
01:18:58.401,01:19:00.152,I was just leaving.
01:19:00.236,01:19:02.530,He'll be out of here in a couple of weeks. Just a couple of weeks.
01:19:02.946,01:19:04.990,Coconut? Wrong.
01:19:05.324,01:19:07.910,A snake? Wrong.
01:19:09.245,01:19:11.997,A peanut? Yuck.
01:19:12.081,01:19:14.333,A hot dog? Wrong.
01:19:15.000,01:19:30.140,Uh-- That was fast. Yeah.
01:19:31.308,01:19:32.809,Didn't want you to miss your plane.
01:19:32.893,01:19:34.729,That's very thoughtful of you.
01:19:42.612,01:19:44.363,"Want a ride, big boy?"
01:19:44.447,01:19:46.699,"Check it out, man."
01:19:49.535,01:19:51.704,You won't believe what happened to me last night.
01:19:58.919,01:20:07.344,"I have something for you. I figured since you never got to the beach-- I know. Water is water, sand is sand. Here, there, it's all the same."
01:20:10.306,01:20:13.142,"Thank you, Frank. It was an interesting vacation."
01:20:13.225,01:20:14.977,What more could one ask for?
01:20:15.478,01:20:17.647,Oh. Yeah.
01:20:17.730,01:20:20.190,"Au revoir, Frank. Au revoir, my friend."
01:20:20.483,01:20:22.526,Have a good flight. I doubt it.
01:20:22.610,01:20:24.320,They said it is all headwinds.
01:20:24.487,01:20:27.573,"I guess we can't have everything we wish for, can we?"
01:20:28.532,01:20:30.493,"No, we can't."
01:20:45.841,01:20:47.176,Yeah.
01:20:53.849,01:20:55.768,I'm listening.
