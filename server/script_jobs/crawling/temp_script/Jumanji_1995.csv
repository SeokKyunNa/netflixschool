00:00:52.792,00:00:54.792,"Don't worry, it's just a pack of wolves."
00:00:54.792,00:00:57.917,"Come on, we're almost rid of it."
00:01:14.834,00:01:16.583,"Caleb, it's after me!"
00:01:16.583,00:01:17.834,Grab on!
00:01:18.792,00:01:20.041,Run! Run!
00:01:20.041,00:01:22.834,"No, Benjamin!"
00:01:22.834,00:01:24.000,"Come on, help me bury it."
00:01:28.291,00:01:31.000,What if someone digs it up?
00:01:33.333,00:01:35.959,May God have mercy on his soul.
00:01:37.458,00:01:39.625,Yah!
00:02:09.750,00:02:11.917,"Hi, Alan."
00:02:11.917,00:02:14.458,"Good afternoon, Alan."
00:02:21.875,00:02:22.875,"All yours, Alan."
00:02:22.875,00:02:25.083,"Thanks, Bill."
00:02:38.041,00:02:40.000,BOY: Get him!
00:02:46.917,00:02:48.291,"Prepare to die, Parrish!"
00:02:50.834,00:02:53.834,"Hey, Parrish, what's the rush?"
00:02:59.834,00:03:02.041,BOY: He's going to his dad's factory.
00:03:03.750,00:03:07.291,BOY 2: Parrish wants his daddy now.
00:03:19.417,00:03:20.875,"Go on, Parrish!"
00:03:20.875,00:03:22.834,Run to Daddy!
00:03:22.834,00:03:24.041,We'll be waiting.
00:03:44.625,00:03:45.625,"Hi, Carl."
00:03:45.625,00:03:47.500,"Hey, Alan, my man!"
00:03:47.500,00:03:49.834,I've gotta show you something.
00:03:49.834,00:03:51.917,"Now, I've been working on this for almost a year."
00:03:51.917,00:03:57.125,And I got an appointment this afternoon with your father to show him this.
00:03:57.125,00:03:58.166,Go ahead. Take it!
00:03:59.834,00:04:02.083,"So, what do you think?"
00:04:02.083,00:04:04.208,What is it?
00:04:04.208,00:04:05.333,What is it?
00:04:05.333,00:04:07.083,"Man, this is the future!"
00:04:07.083,00:04:12.834,"If I can get Wilt Chamberlain to wear 'em, I predict there'll be a pair of those in every closet in America."
00:04:12.834,00:04:14.917,That's gonna be the height of fashion.
00:04:17.208,00:04:20.041,CARL: What's wrong?
00:04:20.041,00:04:21.542,Nothing.
00:04:21.542,00:04:22.917,MAN: Alan!
00:04:22.917,00:04:24.750,"Thanks, Bob."
00:04:24.750,00:04:26.375,What are you doing here?
00:04:26.375,00:04:28.625,I've told you. This factory isn't a playground.
00:04:28.625,00:04:29.792,It's dangerous.
00:04:29.792,00:04:31.667,"Dad, can I have a ride home?"
00:04:31.667,00:04:36.375,"Oh, Alan, is Billy Jessup picking on you again?"
00:04:37.625,00:04:40.834,"Son, you're gonna have to face him sooner or later."
00:04:40.834,00:04:42.000,Look.
00:04:42.000,00:04:45.625,"If you're afraid of something, you've got to stand and face it."
00:04:45.625,00:04:47.917,"Now, run on, son."
00:04:48.834,00:04:52.792,"Carl, you should know better than to let the boy play in here."
00:04:52.792,00:04:54.083,"Oh, sorry, sir."
00:04:54.083,00:04:56.583,"Oh, uh, what was it you wanted to show me?"
00:04:56.583,00:04:58.917,"Just a minute, sir."
00:05:06.083,00:05:07.792,What the devil--?
00:05:11.458,00:05:14.125,MAN: An extinguisher!
00:05:23.166,00:05:25.500,MR. PARRISH: Who did this?
00:05:25.500,00:05:27.125,Well?
00:05:31.125,00:05:33.000,"I did, sir."
00:05:46.333,00:05:50.375,Just because you're a Parrish doesn't mean you can hang around with my girlfriend.
00:05:50.375,00:05:52.250,We're just friends.
00:05:52.250,00:05:54.041,Not anymore.
00:05:54.041,00:05:55.208,BOY: Get him!
00:05:55.208,00:05:56.166,BOY 2: Yeah!
00:05:59.458,00:06:02.250,BOY 3: Let's go.
00:06:02.250,00:06:04.333,BOY 2: Whoo! Yeah!
00:06:07.417,00:06:09.500,Jerks!
00:08:05.333,00:08:07.792,Wow.
00:08:56.375,00:08:59.375,Neat.
00:09:05.375,00:09:06.917,WOMAN: Alan?
00:09:08.375,00:09:10.458,Are you home?
00:09:15.625,00:09:18.083,"Oh, Alan."
00:09:18.083,00:09:20.417,Not again.
00:09:22.667,00:09:26.166,"MR. PARRISH: ...hard work, determination, a cheerful outlook."
00:09:26.166,00:09:32.125,Attributes that have exemplified the Brantford spirit since our forefathers first settled this town.
00:09:32.125,00:09:40.333,"Despite the harshness of our native clime and the granite of our soil, we have-- Prospects."
00:09:40.333,00:09:42.500,I knew the whole damn thing this morning.
00:09:42.500,00:09:44.417,You'll know the whole...
00:09:44.417,00:09:45.959,"Right, let's go."
00:09:45.959,00:09:48.583,Hmm?
00:09:54.750,00:09:57.125,"Well, we're, uh..."
00:09:57.125,00:09:58.792,Okay.
00:09:58.792,00:10:03.333,"I told your father what you told me this afternoon, that it wasn't just Billy Jessup."
00:10:03.333,00:10:05.417,"Look, if I..."
00:10:03.333,00:10:08.041,"if I'd known that, Alan, I wouldn't have-- It's okay, Dad."
00:10:08.041,00:10:10.041,But I want you to know how proud I am of you.
00:10:10.041,00:10:12.667,"I mean, you faced them, even though you were outnumbered."
00:10:12.667,00:10:13.792,And...
00:10:13.792,00:10:21.458,"since you took it like a man, your mother and I have decided that you're ready to go to The Cliffside School for Boys."
00:10:21.458,00:10:23.917,There.
00:10:26.083,00:10:27.959,You don't want me living here anymore?
00:10:27.959,00:10:33.417,MRS. PARRISH: Alan-- It's always been the plan that you'd go to Cliffside when you were ready.
00:10:33.417,00:10:37.917,"I mean, Parrishes have been going to Cliffside, uh, ever since the 1700s."
00:10:37.917,00:10:39.625,Even your Uncle Skylar went there.
00:10:39.625,00:10:41.000,Look at this.
00:10:41.000,00:10:43.041,Parrish Hall?
00:10:43.041,00:10:44.834,MR. PARRISH: It's the main dormitory.
00:10:46.875,00:10:49.041,"Oh, this is great."
00:10:49.041,00:10:52.417,Kids are on my case here because I'm a Parrish.
00:10:52.417,00:10:55.917,Just wait till I'm living in a building named after me.
00:10:55.917,00:10:58.417,It was named after my father.
00:10:58.417,00:11:00.250,Good. Why don't you live in it?
00:11:00.250,00:11:02.125,I did.
00:11:02.125,00:11:04.917,I wouldn't be who I am today if it weren't for my years there.
00:11:06.291,00:11:08.667,Maybe I don't want to be who you are.
00:11:08.667,00:11:10.542,Maybe I don't even want to be a Parrish.
00:11:12.959,00:11:16.041,You won't be. Not till you start acting like one.
00:11:16.041,00:11:18.333,Sam-- Get your coat.
00:11:21.583,00:11:24.750,I guess I'm not ready for Cliffside then!
00:11:24.750,00:11:26.792,We're taking you there next Sunday!
00:11:26.792,00:11:29.417,And I don't want to hear another word about it!
00:11:29.417,00:11:32.834,You won't! I'm never talking to you again!
00:11:39.166,00:11:41.583,Sam.
00:11:41.583,00:11:42.625,Sam!
00:11:42.625,00:11:43.750,What?
00:11:43.750,00:12:13.375,Nothing. Just-- What are you doing here?
00:12:13.375,00:12:15.834,I brought your bike back.
00:12:15.834,00:12:17.500,You didn't have to.
00:12:17.500,00:12:19.875,I was going over to Billy's to get it myself.
00:12:19.875,00:12:21.834,I told Billy to stop picking on you.
00:12:21.834,00:12:23.792,You shouldn't have wasted your breath.
00:12:23.792,00:12:27.125,But we've got to talk about this some other time.
00:12:28.750,00:12:30.291,What was that?
00:12:31.834,00:12:33.500,You heard it too?
00:12:33.500,00:12:34.875,Of course I heard it.
00:12:34.875,00:12:36.834,Come on.
00:12:36.834,00:12:39.208,I found this really weird game in the factory.
00:12:39.208,00:12:41.583,A game?
00:12:57.792,00:12:59.500,Jumanji.
00:12:59.500,00:13:04.083,A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind.
00:13:04.083,00:13:06.834,You roll the dice to move your token.
00:13:06.834,00:13:08.792,Doubles get another turn.
00:13:08.792,00:13:11.125,The first player to reach the end wins. Want to play?
00:13:11.125,00:13:14.917,I quit playing board games five years ago.
00:13:17.792,00:13:19.917,Sarah!
00:13:25.667,00:13:28.458,It's got to be magnetized or something.
00:13:28.458,00:13:29.792,"Alan, look."
00:13:32.333,00:13:40.291,"At night they fly, you better run, these winged things are not much fun."
00:13:46.291,00:13:47.625,What was that?
00:13:47.625,00:13:49.917,I-I don't know.
00:13:50.792,00:13:52.875,"Put it away, Alan."
00:13:59.750,00:14:00.917,"Oh, no."
00:14:00.917,00:14:03.667,The game thinks I rolled.
00:14:03.667,00:14:06.917,What do you mean the game thinks?
00:14:09.250,00:14:15.750,"ALAN: In the jungle you must wait, until the dice read five or eight."
00:14:15.750,00:14:18.709,In the jungle you must wait.
00:14:18.709,00:14:20.875,What's that mean?
00:14:24.500,00:14:27.667,Aahhh!
00:14:36.291,00:14:38.417,Sarah!
00:14:38.417,00:14:40.750,ALAN: Roll the dice!
00:14:41.834,00:14:44.125,Sarah!
00:15:19.792,00:15:23.792,WOMAN: I think a bed and breakfast is just what this town needs.
00:15:23.792,00:15:27.458,"NORA: Well, it was pretty hard to pass up, especially full of furniture."
00:15:27.458,00:15:28.875,"Oh, boy."
00:15:28.875,00:15:31.917,I keep forgetting how big this place is.
00:15:31.917,00:15:34.000,"Judy, Peter, come look at this!"
00:15:34.000,00:15:36.834,I'm gonna put a reception area right over here.
00:15:36.834,00:15:38.917,Uh-huh.
00:15:38.917,00:15:41.542,A bar over here in the parlor.
00:15:45.000,00:15:46.542,That sounds lovely.
00:15:46.542,00:15:49.875,I'm sure you and your kids are gonna be very happy here.
00:15:49.875,00:15:51.625,"Oh, well..."
00:15:51.625,00:15:54.709,"Actually, they're my late brother's."
00:15:54.709,00:15:57.834,He and his wife passed away just last winter.
00:16:00.792,00:16:03.625,Is this something or what?
00:16:04.542,00:16:06.917,It sure is.
00:16:20.750,00:16:23.917,"What do you think, young man?"
00:16:35.250,00:16:38.834,Peter hasn't spoken a word since it happened.
00:16:38.834,00:16:40.291,Oh.
00:16:40.291,00:16:41.792,"Oh, my."
00:16:41.792,00:16:44.500,I'm so sorry.
00:16:44.500,00:16:47.333,It's okay.
00:16:48.667,00:16:50.750,We barely even knew our parents.
00:16:50.750,00:16:52.083,They were always away.
00:16:52.083,00:16:55.458,"Skiing in St Moritz, gambling in Monte Carlo."
00:16:55.458,00:16:58.583,Safariing in darkest Africa.
00:16:58.583,00:17:01.291,We didn't even know if they loved us.
00:17:01.291,00:17:04.750,"But when the sheik's yacht went down, well..."
00:17:04.750,00:17:12.166,they managed to write us a really beautiful goodbye note that was found floating in a champagne bottle amongst the debris.
00:17:13.792,00:17:15.083,Excuse me.
00:17:22.291,00:17:24.291,They were very devoted parents.
00:17:24.291,00:17:26.000,It was a car crash in Canada.
00:17:26.000,00:17:27.875,So you'll send me those escrow papers?
00:17:27.875,00:17:29.000,First thing tomorrow.
00:17:30.166,00:17:32.834,WOMAN: I know you've always...
00:18:01.792,00:18:04.834,"Oh, I'll have to get a locksmith out for this one."
00:18:04.834,00:18:08.125,"Peter, pick up your toys, please."
00:18:14.875,00:18:17.875,"Peter, take this suitcase up to the attic."
00:18:17.875,00:18:20.041,Then we can all have ice cream.
00:18:20.041,00:18:22.458,And bourbon.
00:18:40.834,00:18:42.709,PETER: Arggh!
00:18:47.250,00:18:49.875,What? What is it?
00:18:51.542,00:18:52.834,I'm going to Motel 6.
00:18:52.834,00:18:55.917,"Oh, for heaven's sake."
00:19:21.000,00:19:23.000,I don't see any guano.
00:19:28.333,00:19:29.875,He said it looked like that.
00:19:29.875,00:19:32.083,MAN: That's an African bat.
00:19:32.083,00:19:34.792,Some kid said she saw a bunch of those back in the '60s.
00:19:34.792,00:19:37.959,But we don't get bats like that in New England.
00:19:37.959,00:19:39.875,But that's what he saw.
00:19:39.875,00:19:44.667,"Well, whatever it was, it's gone now."
00:19:44.667,00:19:48.834,"Bats aren't what I'd worry about in this house, anyways."
00:19:48.834,00:19:50.834,What would you worry about?
00:19:50.834,00:19:57.041,"Well, personally, I wouldn't want to live in a house where someone was murdered."
00:19:58.792,00:19:59.959,Murdered?
00:19:59.959,00:20:01.875,Little Alan Parrish.
00:20:01.875,00:20:03.417,I say his father did it.
00:20:03.417,00:20:08.542,There's a thousand and one places he could have hid the body in this house.
00:20:08.542,00:20:12.458,Especially if he chopped it up first.
00:20:12.458,00:20:14.458,"NORA: Hey, up there!"
00:20:14.458,00:20:18.083,You kids don't want to be late for your first day of school.
00:20:20.834,00:20:22.875,"Not a bat in sight, ma'am."
00:20:22.875,00:20:24.500,NORA: You hear that?
00:20:24.500,00:20:27.417,There's nothing to be afraid of in this house!
00:20:54.291,00:20:58.125,I can't believe I have to see your principal after your first day.
00:20:58.125,00:20:59.917,What am I gonna do?
00:21:01.875,00:21:06.917,"Now, let's just try to relax and finish our dinner and talk about something else."
00:21:06.917,00:21:09.375,"Well, we found out why you got this house so cheap."
00:21:09.375,00:21:13.834,"Twenty-six years ago, a kid named Alan Parrish used to live here."
00:21:13.834,00:21:20.375,"Then one day, he just disappeared 'cause his parents chopped him up in little pieces and hid him in the walls."
00:21:20.375,00:21:23.125,"Okay. That's it. I am sick and tired of your lies, young lady."
00:21:23.125,00:21:24.500,You're grounded.
00:21:27.625,00:21:31.458,Fine. There's nowhere to go in this stupid town anyway.
00:21:31.458,00:21:35.917,"But just for your information, that wasn't a lie."
00:22:12.041,00:22:14.375,Did you hear anything a little while ago?
00:22:18.625,00:22:21.250,Do you miss Mom and Dad?
00:22:22.792,00:22:24.542,No.
00:22:24.542,00:22:25.709,Liar.
00:22:25.709,00:22:29.208,"If you don't cut that out, they're gonna send you to a shrink."
00:22:29.208,00:22:33.333,Where do you think they're gonna send you if you don't start talking?
00:22:50.625,00:22:54.208,"If I get held up at the permit office, I'll give you a call."
00:22:54.208,00:22:56.083,School bus should be here any minute.
00:22:59.417,00:23:01.125,You guys still have your house keys?
00:23:02.917,00:23:04.291,Are you guys listening to me?
00:23:05.834,00:23:07.583,Hello?
00:23:07.583,00:23:09.083,Hello?
00:23:10.083,00:23:11.291,What?
00:23:13.083,00:23:15.375,Maybe I should wait with you till the bus comes.
00:23:15.375,00:23:18.291,Did your parents used to put you on the bus?
00:23:18.291,00:23:19.458,No.
00:23:20.333,00:23:22.291,No.
00:23:23.375,00:23:25.083,I could drop you off.
00:23:25.083,00:23:29.375,No. Don't worry about us.
00:23:29.375,00:23:31.166,Okay.
00:23:31.166,00:23:33.166,Please be good today.
00:23:43.083,00:23:44.208,You do hear it.
00:23:44.208,00:23:46.709,Hear what?
00:24:01.208,00:24:03.417,Where's it coming from?
00:24:34.291,00:24:35.834,Wow!
00:24:35.834,00:24:39.417,Let's bring it over here.
00:24:50.875,00:24:53.750,Weird. They're stuck.
00:24:53.750,00:24:54.875,Jumanji.
00:24:54.875,00:24:58.291,A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind.
00:24:58.291,00:25:00.125,You roll the dice to move your token.
00:25:00.125,00:25:01.500,Doubles get another turn.
00:25:01.500,00:25:03.500,The first player to reach the end wins.
00:25:09.875,00:25:12.834,It's got to be microchips or something.
00:25:14.417,00:25:16.667,You go first.
00:25:17.834,00:25:20.166,Okay.
00:25:23.166,00:25:24.500,Six.
00:25:36.959,00:25:41.583,"JUDY: A tiny bite can make you itch, make you sneeze, make you twitch."
00:26:19.417,00:26:20.917,JUDY: Don't.
00:26:24.792,00:26:28.375,PETER: This will not be an easy mission.
00:26:28.375,00:26:31.333,Monkeys slow the expedition.
00:26:33.959,00:26:35.625,What is that?
00:27:17.375,00:27:19.959,I bet those monkeys came from the game.
00:27:19.959,00:27:22.375,The mosquitoes too.
00:27:23.542,00:27:25.458,Uh-oh!
00:27:25.458,00:27:27.917,I didn't see this part.
00:27:30.583,00:27:40.792,"Adventurers, beware-- JUDY: Adventurers, beware."
00:27:40.792,00:27:43.250,Do not begin unless you intend to finish.
00:27:43.250,00:27:49.500,The exciting consequences of the game will vanish only when a player has reached Jumanji and called out its name.
00:27:49.500,00:27:51.542,The monkeys are gone.
00:27:51.542,00:27:53.792,Put it away.
00:27:53.792,00:27:56.834,The instructions say if we finish the game it will all go away.
00:27:56.834,00:27:58.917,"We better do it, or Aunt Nora's gonna pitch a fit."
00:27:58.917,00:28:00.834,We should just get through it quickly.
00:28:00.834,00:28:03.834,"I mean, there's no skill involved."
00:28:05.000,00:28:06.542,No.
00:28:06.542,00:28:09.500,You rolled doubles.
00:28:09.500,00:28:11.083,Roll!
00:28:12.000,00:28:13.417,Five.
00:28:15.500,00:28:18.750,His fangs are sharp.
00:28:18.750,00:28:20.417,He likes your taste.
00:28:20.417,00:28:25.458,Your party better move posthaste.
00:28:25.458,00:28:28.000,I don't like the sound of that.
00:28:29.834,00:28:31.875,"Judy, someone's in here."
00:28:51.959,00:28:53.959,"It's not real, Peter."
00:28:53.959,00:28:56.583,It's a hallucination.
00:28:59.834,00:29:01.375,"Run, Peter!"
00:29:21.625,00:29:23.667,Hup!
00:29:29.583,00:29:30.625,Haaaa!
00:29:31.834,00:29:33.834,Ha!
00:30:03.834,00:30:05.917,Aah!
00:30:34.667,00:30:36.750,I'm back.
00:30:41.750,00:30:43.917,My bike.
00:31:29.750,00:31:33.834,Somebody roll a five or an eight?
00:31:35.333,00:31:37.125,He did.
00:31:37.125,00:31:39.166,Ha-ha!
00:31:43.417,00:31:45.500,"Oh, thank you! Thank you!"
00:31:45.500,00:31:47.291,Thank you! Thank you!
00:31:47.291,00:31:49.792,Thank you! Thank you!
00:31:49.792,00:31:52.500,Thank you.
00:31:52.500,00:31:53.959,Sorry if I scared you.
00:31:53.959,00:31:54.959,Thank you.
00:31:54.959,00:31:57.041,I'm back!
00:31:57.041,00:31:59.625,Mom! Dad!
00:32:01.125,00:32:03.834,I'm home!
00:32:03.834,00:32:06.458,I'm back!
00:32:06.458,00:32:07.834,It's me!
00:32:07.834,00:32:10.792,"It's me, Alan, Mom and Dad."
00:32:10.792,00:32:12.625,I'm home!
00:32:12.625,00:32:14.792,I'm back...
00:32:14.792,00:32:17.834,Are you my little sister?
00:32:17.834,00:32:19.083,No.
00:32:19.083,00:32:21.000,"I'm Judy, and he's Peter."
00:32:21.000,00:32:23.834,Where's Mom?
00:32:23.834,00:32:28.834,Are you...Alan Parrish?
00:32:28.834,00:32:30.458,Yeah.
00:32:30.458,00:32:31.834,Who are you?
00:32:31.834,00:32:33.834,We live here now.
00:32:33.834,00:32:36.834,Where's my mom and dad?
00:32:36.834,00:32:38.834,We don't know.
00:32:38.834,00:32:42.834,This house has been empty for years.
00:32:42.834,00:32:46.542,Everyone thought you were dead.
00:32:56.834,00:32:58.834,Sorry.
00:33:03.875,00:33:05.250,Give me that description again.
00:33:05.250,00:33:06.959,"WOMAN: I said red fur, long tail."
00:33:13.834,00:33:16.750,Oh!
00:33:16.750,00:33:19.792,"Get down off of my car, please."
00:33:19.792,00:33:22.542,And get up on the sidewalk.
00:33:23.875,00:33:25.709,What year is it?
00:33:25.709,00:33:26.834,Uh...it was brand-new.
00:33:26.834,00:33:30.875,No. What year is it?
00:33:30.875,00:33:32.542,"Uh...1995, remember?"
00:33:32.542,00:33:34.291,'95.
00:33:34.291,00:33:35.792,"Oh, let me guess."
00:33:35.792,00:33:37.792,"You left it in the other Tarzan outfit, right?"
00:33:37.792,00:33:40.834,Twenty-six years!
00:33:40.834,00:33:42.291,I was.
00:33:42.291,00:33:44.333,But I've been in Jumanji.
00:33:44.333,00:33:45.375,JUDY: Indonesia.
00:33:45.375,00:33:47.125,He was in the Peace Corps.
00:33:54.333,00:33:57.417,Carl Bentley. The Sole Man.
00:33:57.417,00:33:58.542,"JUDY: Yes, sir."
00:33:58.542,00:33:59.959,He's our...uncle.
00:33:59.959,00:34:01.834,CARL: Does he always dress like that?
00:34:01.834,00:34:04.834,"JUDY: Well, yeah. He's a vegetarian."
00:34:04.834,00:34:06.875,Get out of there!
00:34:06.875,00:34:08.792,Ah! Ah! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!
00:34:12.709,00:34:13.834,Monkeys!
00:34:13.834,00:34:15.667,Monkeys.
00:34:15.667,00:34:18.208,Is--? Is he all right upstairs?
00:34:18.208,00:34:20.875,He suffered a head injury a few months ago.
00:34:35.667,00:34:36.875,Don't you move!
00:34:36.875,00:34:39.667,Freeze! Hey! Stop!
00:34:39.667,00:34:41.667,Don't move. Don't move.
00:34:41.667,00:34:43.959,"Hey, wait a minute!"
00:34:43.959,00:34:46.917,To find my parents!
00:34:47.834,00:34:49.709,Come on!
00:35:15.834,00:35:17.792,Wait!
00:36:12.041,00:36:16.000,My dad used to make shoes here.
00:36:16.000,00:36:19.625,They were the best shoes in New England.
00:36:21.542,00:36:25.875,Hey!
00:36:29.625,00:36:30.875,S-sorry.
00:36:33.125,00:36:35.959,"MAN: Easy, girl."
00:36:39.709,00:36:42.875,Do you know what happened to this shoe factory?
00:36:42.875,00:36:45.834,Yeah. It folded up.
00:36:45.834,00:36:49.208,Like everything else in this town.
00:36:49.208,00:36:52.125,It's pretty cold out there.
00:36:52.125,00:36:55.542,Why would they close Parrish Shoes?
00:36:55.542,00:36:58.333,Well...when his kid ran away...
00:36:58.333,00:37:00.875,Sam put everything he had into trying to find him.
00:37:00.875,00:37:02.875,"His time, his money."
00:37:02.875,00:37:04.917,Everything.
00:37:04.917,00:37:07.917,"After a while, he stopped coming to work."
00:37:07.917,00:37:11.458,He just quit caring.
00:37:11.458,00:37:16.125,I don't think anybody loved his boy more than Sam did.
00:37:17.375,00:37:19.458,Here.
00:37:21.000,00:37:23.834,You're gonna freeze out there.
00:37:23.834,00:37:26.583,Thank you.
00:37:26.583,00:37:28.834,Are the Parrishes still around?
00:37:28.834,00:37:31.000,I see them now and then.
00:37:31.000,00:37:32.834,Yeah?
00:37:32.834,00:37:35.709,They're over on Adams Street.
00:37:54.208,00:37:57.041,Our parents are dead too.
00:37:58.792,00:38:11.417,They were in the Middle East negotiating peace-- Our dad was in advertising.
00:38:12.542,00:38:15.709,"Bet you miss him, huh?"
00:38:15.709,00:38:17.375,Me too.
00:38:21.583,00:38:23.917,There he goes again.
00:38:25.834,00:38:29.792,"Listen, I know you're upset and all, but I kind of feel we should finish the game."
00:38:29.792,00:38:31.792,We? Why do you need me?
00:38:31.792,00:38:34.875,Well...just in case any other scary stuff comes out.
00:38:34.875,00:38:36.709,Plus there's a lion in my aunt's bedroom.
00:38:36.709,00:38:38.000,What am I supposed to do about that?
00:38:38.000,00:38:39.792,What do I look like?
00:38:39.792,00:38:42.917,But she'll be home soon.
00:38:42.917,00:38:44.792,I hope she's not allergic to cats.
00:39:00.333,00:39:03.583,MAN: Larry! We need the wheels.
00:39:03.583,00:39:05.291,We hit her that hard?
00:39:05.291,00:39:08.834,No. It looks like another one of those weird bites.
00:39:14.166,00:39:16.375,"Yeah, it's another one, all right."
00:39:16.375,00:39:19.792,Jesus! Number 50.
00:39:19.792,00:39:21.792,Easy now. Easy!
00:39:21.792,00:39:24.000,Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
00:39:24.000,00:39:25.083,The realtor.
00:39:25.083,00:39:27.583,Quiet. Listen.
00:39:27.583,00:39:29.417,You hear that?
00:39:29.417,00:39:31.834,Hear what?
00:39:31.834,00:39:33.917,Get in the car.
00:39:38.792,00:39:40.542,ALAN: Okay. Think.
00:39:40.542,00:39:43.250,What came out of the game before me?
00:39:43.250,00:39:46.834,"Um, there was a lion, a bunch of monkeys, and, um..."
00:39:46.834,00:39:47.834,That!
00:39:47.834,00:39:50.000,Ah!
00:39:50.000,00:39:53.250,It's okay. It's okay.
00:39:53.250,00:39:55.375,We're safe in here.
00:39:55.375,00:39:57.125,See? We're fine.
00:39:59.834,00:40:02.875,"We'll stay low. He can't get through there too far, okay?"
00:40:02.875,00:40:03.875,Don't you worry.
00:40:03.875,00:40:04.917,ALAN: We're fine.
00:40:06.083,00:40:07.542,Hey! He can't get us in here.
00:40:07.542,00:40:09.250,He can't get through the glass.
00:40:09.250,00:40:11.291,We're safe.
00:40:13.000,00:40:15.583,Either one of you know how to drive?
00:40:15.583,00:40:16.709,No?
00:40:16.709,00:40:18.375,"Well, that's no problem."
00:40:18.375,00:40:21.834,My dad used to let me back the car down the driveway...
00:40:21.834,00:40:23.250,once.
00:40:23.250,00:40:24.834,"So, what's the big deal?"
00:40:24.834,00:40:26.125,Buckle up.
00:40:26.125,00:40:27.166,Here we go!
00:40:28.834,00:40:31.125,Ho!
00:40:31.125,00:40:32.875,"Oh, wait a minute."
00:40:32.875,00:40:34.709,Wait. That's it.
00:40:39.834,00:40:41.250,That's the top!
00:40:58.750,00:41:00.917,Piece of cake.
00:41:02.250,00:41:03.917,Yeah.
00:41:17.792,00:41:19.333,JUDY: Alan?
00:41:21.125,00:41:24.375,Keep that thing away from me.
00:41:24.375,00:41:27.333,When are you going to help us play?
00:41:27.333,00:41:29.834,We've got to hurry. Our aunt's going to be home soon.
00:41:29.834,00:41:31.500,"Well, good."
00:41:31.500,00:41:33.875,You can inform her that she's the ex-owner of this house.
00:41:33.875,00:41:39.750,"'Cause I hope you realize with my parents gone, this home belongs to me."
00:41:42.917,00:41:45.166,"Oh, thank you."
00:41:45.166,00:41:47.417,No more banana leaves.
00:41:47.417,00:41:48.917,Yes.
00:41:53.750,00:41:57.041,What do you think those monkeys are gonna do to the ecosystem around here?
00:41:57.041,00:42:02.375,ALAN: Hello?!
00:42:02.375,00:42:33.291,Of this tropic port What happened to you?
00:42:33.291,00:42:35.458,You shave with a piece of glass?
00:42:35.458,00:42:39.750,What happened to you?
00:42:39.750,00:42:41.792,What do you want?
00:42:41.792,00:42:43.709,Where are you going?
00:42:43.709,00:42:48.583,"How about Peter and I play, and you just sort of watch?"
00:42:48.583,00:42:50.208,"Thanks, I've seen it."
00:42:50.208,00:42:54.333,"So if you're not gonna help us, what are you gonna do?"
00:42:54.333,00:42:58.333,I don't know. Pretty much take up where I left off.
00:42:58.333,00:43:01.291,I wonder if Mrs. Niedermeyer's still teaching sixth grade?
00:43:10.750,00:43:13.875,"Come on, Judy, he's not going to help us. He's afraid."
00:43:13.875,00:43:16.875,What did you say?
00:43:16.875,00:43:19.458,You're afraid.
00:43:19.458,00:43:20.875,It's okay to be afraid.
00:43:24.166,00:43:25.917,Let's go set it up in the living room.
00:43:29.125,00:43:32.542,"No, you have no idea what you're getting yourself into."
00:43:32.542,00:43:34.625,"Whatever it is, we'll handle it by ourselves."
00:43:34.625,00:43:37.000,We don't need your help.
00:43:37.000,00:43:38.750,I don't think so.
00:43:38.750,00:43:43.500,"You think the monkeys, mosquitoes and lions are bad?"
00:43:43.500,00:43:46.250,That's just the beginning.
00:43:46.250,00:43:50.333,I've seen things you've only seen in your nightmares.
00:43:50.333,00:43:54.000,Things you can't even imagine.
00:43:54.000,00:43:56.417,Things you can't even see.
00:43:56.417,00:44:00.667,There are things that hunt you in the night.
00:44:00.667,00:44:09.375,"Then something screams, then you hear them eat, and you hope to God that you're not dessert."
00:44:09.375,00:44:11.583,Afraid?
00:44:11.583,00:44:14.834,You don't even know what afraid is.
00:44:14.834,00:44:17.959,You will not last five minutes without me.
00:44:17.959,00:44:22.959,So...you're going to help us?
00:44:24.959,00:44:27.834,I'll watch.
00:44:31.417,00:44:33.625,But I'm not afraid.
00:44:42.792,00:44:46.291,"Peter, that was very cool."
00:44:46.291,00:44:47.834,It's reverse psychology.
00:44:47.834,00:44:51.417,Dad used to pull it on me all the time.
00:44:51.417,00:44:52.417,Ready?
00:44:52.417,00:44:54.959,Yeah.
00:44:54.959,00:44:57.250,"Alan, ready?"
00:44:57.250,00:45:00.000,There is no ready.
00:45:09.208,00:45:10.709,I'll try it again.
00:45:19.417,00:45:21.291,"Alan, it's not working."
00:45:29.458,00:45:31.542,"ALAN: Oh, no."
00:45:31.542,00:45:33.041,It's not your turn.
00:45:33.041,00:45:38.166,"Yeah, I rolled first, and then Peter twice 'cause he got doubles, and now it's my turn again."
00:45:38.166,00:45:40.291,"No, look."
00:45:40.291,00:45:42.792,"Two of those pieces are yours, right?"
00:45:42.792,00:45:44.583,Whose are the other pieces?
00:45:48.208,00:45:49.834,The elephant was mine.
00:45:52.542,00:45:57.250,You're playing the game I started in 1969.
00:45:57.250,00:45:59.917,I'm gonna have to play.
00:46:04.583,00:46:06.875,It's not my turn.
00:46:06.875,00:46:09.917,Whose turn is it?
00:46:12.208,00:46:15.792,Sarah Whittle.
00:46:21.875,00:46:25.834,This is where she used to live.
00:46:25.834,00:46:28.917,This place gives me the creeps.
00:46:39.500,00:46:42.667,We used to play on this porch.
00:46:45.166,00:46:46.792,I knew she still wouldn't live here.
00:46:46.792,00:46:49.458,"Probably married Billy Jessup, and they're living in a trailer park."
00:46:49.458,00:46:50.792,Let's go.
00:46:50.792,00:46:52.750,Maybe she'll know where Sarah went.
00:46:52.750,00:46:55.667,Of course she'll know where Sarah went. She's a psychic.
00:46:55.667,00:46:57.625,Good point.
00:46:59.041,00:47:01.834,"I remember the porch being a lot bigger, though."
00:47:01.834,00:47:02.917,WOMAN: Hello?
00:47:04.333,00:47:06.500,"Um, can you help us?"
00:47:06.500,00:47:07.875,Do you have an appointment?
00:47:07.875,00:47:09.959,"No, we're just trying to find someone."
00:47:09.959,00:47:12.291,"Well, Madam Serena can't see anyone right now."
00:47:12.291,00:47:14.750,"Well, maybe you can help us."
00:47:17.834,00:47:19.709,What is it?
00:47:19.709,00:47:22.041,We're looking for someone who used to live here.
00:47:22.041,00:47:24.667,"No, I've lived here my whole life."
00:47:24.667,00:47:27.417,"Well, then you must know Sarah Whittle."
00:47:31.750,00:47:34.625,What do you want with Sarah Whittle?
00:47:35.834,00:47:37.875,Sarah?
00:47:37.875,00:47:40.000,"No, I-I don't go by that name anymore."
00:47:42.834,00:47:44.709,Sarah Whittle?
00:47:44.709,00:47:46.917,What do you want?
00:47:48.458,00:47:53.875,"Twenty-six years ago, you played a game with a little boy down the street."
00:47:55.375,00:47:58.000,A game with drums.
00:48:02.375,00:48:03.959,How do you know that?
00:48:05.834,00:48:08.834,"I was that little boy, Sarah."
00:48:11.583,00:48:13.667,Alan.
00:48:20.291,00:48:21.625,You killed her.
00:48:23.041,00:48:27.875,"Leave a message, and the doctor will call you back at his earliest convenience."
00:48:28.792,00:48:30.125,SARAH: Dr. Bornstein?
00:48:30.125,00:48:31.792,It's Sarah Whittle calling.
00:48:31.792,00:48:36.458,"Listen, if you could call me back as soon as you can, I think I need to have my dosage checked."
00:48:36.458,00:48:40.667,"That event we've been discussing for a long time now, the one that didn't really happen?"
00:48:40.667,00:48:45.709,"Oh, boy, I'm having an episode here today with the little boy that didn't really disappear."
00:48:45.709,00:48:48.417,"I'm sitting in his living room, drinking lemonade."
00:48:48.417,00:48:52.834,"If you could call me, I'd really, really be interested in your interpretation."
00:48:52.834,00:48:54.125,Thank you so much.
00:48:54.125,00:48:55.792,Call me back 10 minutes before the hour.
00:48:55.792,00:48:58.792,ALAN: While we're waiting...
00:48:58.792,00:49:00.041,"Sarah, Sarah."
00:49:00.041,00:49:01.875,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
00:49:01.875,00:49:06.208,"Alan, I have spent over 2000 hours in therapy convincing myself that this doesn't exist."
00:49:06.208,00:49:08.959,What happened to you was so awful I made up that whole thing...
00:49:08.959,00:49:11.500,"ALAN: Sarah, Sarah."
00:49:11.500,00:49:13.000,It was awful.
00:49:13.000,00:49:16.834,But it was real.
00:49:16.834,00:49:18.834,"No, no, no."
00:49:18.834,00:49:21.250,Your father murdered you and chopped you up into pieces.
00:49:21.250,00:49:23.250,"Sarah, come on."
00:49:23.250,00:49:25.750,My dad did that?
00:49:25.750,00:49:32.709,"My father could barely hug me, let alone cut me into little pieces."
00:49:32.709,00:49:37.917,"Twenty-six years ago, we started playing a little game."
00:49:37.917,00:49:44.041,"And now we're all gonna sit down, and we're gonna finish it."
00:49:44.041,00:49:45.834,And guess what?
00:49:45.834,00:49:48.417,It's your turn.
00:49:52.917,00:49:54.917,No.
00:49:58.250,00:49:59.834,"Play the game, Sarah."
00:49:59.834,00:50:01.500,"Oh, no."
00:50:01.500,00:50:02.917,Fine.
00:50:03.917,00:50:06.750,"Just give me the dice, and you can go home."
00:50:06.750,00:50:08.417,You don't have to play.
00:50:08.417,00:50:09.625,"Thank you, Alan."
00:50:09.625,00:50:10.875,Oh!
00:50:11.875,00:50:12.834,"Oh, my God!"
00:50:12.834,00:50:14.750,How could you do that?
00:50:14.750,00:50:15.959,"It's law of the jungle, Sarah."
00:50:15.959,00:50:17.458,You'll get used to it.
00:50:17.458,00:50:21.083,SARAH: When I think of all the energy I spent visualizing you as a radiant spirit.
00:50:21.083,00:50:23.709,Go on. Read it.
00:50:29.333,00:50:31.583,They grow much faster than bamboo.
00:50:31.583,00:50:34.667,Take care or they'll come after you.
00:50:36.750,00:50:38.375,"ALAN: Oh, great."
00:50:38.375,00:50:42.041,"SARAH: Oh, God. Tell me this isn't happening."
00:50:42.041,00:50:43.750,"Oh, it is."
00:50:43.750,00:50:45.917,"Stay away from the walls, don't touch anything."
00:50:47.208,00:50:50.542,No quick movements.
00:50:55.125,00:50:56.750,"Wow, they're beautiful."
00:50:56.750,00:50:57.834,"Oh, yeah, they're beautiful."
00:50:57.834,00:50:59.041,Don't touch the purple ones.
00:50:59.041,00:51:01.166,They shoot poisonous barbs.
00:51:01.166,00:51:03.542,And definitely stay away from the pods.
00:51:03.542,00:51:05.834,The big yellow ones.
00:51:05.834,00:51:07.834,What big yellow ones?
00:51:11.041,00:51:12.834,Peter!
00:51:12.834,00:51:15.250,I've got you!
00:51:15.250,00:51:17.750,PETER: Get it off me. Get it off me!
00:51:23.750,00:51:25.917,Aargghhh!
00:51:25.917,00:51:27.417,"Oh, my God."
00:51:32.625,00:51:33.917,Aahhh!
00:51:33.917,00:51:35.041,"Hang on, boy."
00:51:35.041,00:51:37.125,"Sarah, I'll be right back."
00:51:37.125,00:51:38.375,"Oh, my God."
00:51:40.208,00:51:41.458,"Sorry, Angus."
00:51:46.417,00:51:47.917,Harvest time!
00:51:54.917,00:51:57.625,Are you okay?
00:51:57.625,00:51:59.917,Yeah.
00:52:05.875,00:52:07.542,"Oh, my God!"
00:52:07.542,00:52:09.834,My car!
00:52:09.834,00:52:12.041,"Oh, my car!"
00:52:13.417,00:52:16.542,Has anybody seen Carl?
00:52:16.542,00:52:17.834,I can't believe this.
00:52:17.834,00:52:20.250,"Start, start. Please, just-- Yes!"
00:52:20.250,00:52:21.667,Anybody seen Carl?
00:52:21.667,00:52:23.041,Carl?
00:52:23.041,00:52:24.959,Where in heaven's name have you been?
00:52:24.959,00:52:27.792,We've got an animal-control situation on our hands here.
00:52:27.792,00:52:29.458,You've got to get Stan and Willy on it.
00:52:29.458,00:52:33.625,"I'm heading over to the old Parrish place to check out a suspicious character, over."
00:52:34.834,00:52:36.709,I should have been a fireman.
00:52:44.000,00:52:45.750,Yeah.
00:52:45.750,00:52:46.917,Sarah!
00:52:49.291,00:52:51.667,Ooh! Get your hands off me!
00:52:51.667,00:52:53.542,"The game is not over yet, Sarah."
00:52:53.542,00:52:54.750,It is for me.
00:52:54.750,00:52:56.792,You are not in the jungle anymore.
00:52:56.792,00:52:57.917,Stop this!
00:52:57.917,00:53:00.291,You don't treat people like this!
00:53:14.083,00:53:17.917,Anybody up for iced tea?
00:53:22.917,00:53:24.458,"Alan, please."
00:53:24.458,00:53:26.959,"Last time I played this game, it ruined my life."
00:53:28.083,00:53:29.458,It ruined your life?
00:53:31.000,00:53:36.542,In the jungle you must wait till the dice read five or eight.
00:53:36.542,00:53:39.208,"I was a little girl, Alan."
00:53:39.208,00:53:42.375,You disappeared.
00:53:42.375,00:53:48.000,And a bunch of bats surrounded me and chased me down the street.
00:53:48.000,00:53:49.417,I was afraid.
00:53:49.417,00:53:52.834,"I'm sorry, Alan."
00:53:52.834,00:53:55.917,No one believed me.
00:53:55.917,00:53:57.709,So was I.
00:53:57.709,00:54:00.500,"For 26 years, Sarah."
00:54:01.875,00:54:04.041,Me too.
00:54:05.375,00:54:08.834,"It's okay, Sarah."
00:54:08.834,00:54:12.250,"But if we finish the game, it'll all go away."
00:54:12.250,00:54:14.834,What if I get stuck in the game?
00:54:14.834,00:54:18.208,You won't.
00:54:18.208,00:54:20.834,Because I won't stop playing.
00:54:20.834,00:54:22.166,And neither will I.
00:54:22.166,00:54:24.917,I won't either.
00:54:32.208,00:54:34.083,"ALAN: Come on, Sarah."
00:54:34.083,00:54:35.250,JUDY: Please.
00:54:44.083,00:54:45.875,"Oh, I knew this was going to be a bad day."
00:54:45.875,00:54:50.083,"Hey, come on."
00:54:50.083,00:54:52.166,We just have to keep our heads.
00:54:54.583,00:54:56.125,Roll with the punches.
00:55:14.250,00:55:23.125,A hunter from the darkest wilds makes you feel just like a child.
00:55:23.125,00:55:25.041,What is it?
00:55:25.041,00:55:27.834,Van Pelt.
00:55:33.792,00:55:35.250,You miserable coward.
00:55:35.250,00:55:38.125,Come back and face me like a man!
00:55:46.500,00:55:48.542,"Not good enough, Sonny Jim."
00:55:48.542,00:55:52.125,"Coming, ready or not."
00:56:04.125,00:56:05.208,Oh!
00:56:10.041,00:56:11.208,"Hey, you!"
00:56:15.834,00:56:18.792,Drop your gun and get your hands in the air.
00:56:44.166,00:56:47.166,"Man, I don't believe this."
00:56:53.750,00:56:59.792,"So even if Alan gets out of this situation, the same thing's going to happen over and over again."
00:56:59.792,00:57:07.792,"When you carry around so much repressed anger, it attracts a lot of negative energy, and things happen, like ending up in the jungle."
00:57:07.792,00:57:08.875,That was no accident.
00:57:08.875,00:57:10.208,There are no accidents.
00:57:10.208,00:57:11.667,Whose turn is it?
00:57:12.709,00:57:13.792,It's my turn.
00:57:13.792,00:57:14.959,Really? Great.
00:57:14.959,00:57:18.208,You might have told us there was a man there that hunts people.
00:57:18.208,00:57:21.291,"I didn't know, okay?"
00:57:21.291,00:57:23.917,Is he the reason you didn't want to play?
00:57:25.208,00:57:27.792,You didn't want to play either?
00:57:27.792,00:57:32.417,Mr. We-Started-Something 26-Years-Ago- And-Now-We've-Gotta-Finish-It?
00:57:34.750,00:57:36.792,What's the deal with you and this guy?
00:57:36.792,00:57:39.083,He's a hunter. He kills things.
00:57:39.083,00:57:40.792,"And right now he wants to hunt and kill me, okay?"
00:57:40.792,00:57:42.542,Why you?
00:57:42.542,00:57:44.834,I don't know. Everything about me he finds offensive.
00:57:44.834,00:57:46.667,You'd think it would be a waste of time.
00:57:46.667,00:57:48.208,Maybe he needs something for his wall.
00:57:48.208,00:57:50.166,It's your turn.
00:57:50.166,00:57:53.458,Have you thought about sitting and talking about your differences?
00:57:53.458,00:57:55.250,"What, are you crazy?"
00:57:55.250,00:57:58.417,"Don't ever call me crazy, Alan. Ever."
00:57:58.417,00:58:03.250,Because everyone in this town has called me crazy ever since I told the cops you were sucked into a board game.
00:58:03.250,00:58:05.083,Maybe I should roll.
00:58:05.083,00:58:06.542,Yeah.
00:58:06.542,00:58:08.667,SARAH: ...girl who saw Alan Parrish murdered?
00:58:08.667,00:58:11.333,Do you think anybody showed up at my 14th birthday party?
00:58:11.333,00:58:13.333,"Uh, hello. I'm rolling now."
00:58:13.333,00:58:14.625,Billy who?
00:58:14.625,00:58:16.500,"ALAN: Oh, ho. What are you, an owl?"
00:58:16.500,00:58:18.834,"Madam Serena, why don't you dig in the lower reaches..."
00:58:18.834,00:58:20.250,"Here, just roll."
00:58:20.250,00:58:22.125,"ALAN: ...find the memory of your boyfriend, Billy?"
00:58:22.125,00:58:24.959,The little kid who used to steal your bicycle?
00:58:24.959,00:58:26.583,"No, the big kid who probably..."
00:58:26.583,00:58:29.291,"JUDY: Don't be fooled, it isn't thunder."
00:58:29.291,00:58:31.375,Staying put would be a blunder.
00:58:31.375,00:58:33.291,ALAN: You're immature.
00:58:33.291,00:58:35.417,"I know you are, but what am I?"
00:58:35.417,00:58:36.834,"Oh, right. You can't..."
00:58:36.834,00:58:38.625,Do you feel that?
00:59:03.709,00:59:05.291,Run!
00:59:05.291,00:59:06.542,It's a stampede!
00:59:06.542,00:59:08.375,Come on.
00:59:08.375,00:59:10.417,The game!
00:59:10.417,00:59:12.667,Arggh!
00:59:16.709,00:59:17.875,Don't look back!
00:59:19.834,00:59:20.917,Arggh!
00:59:22.834,00:59:24.500,ALAN: Argh!
00:59:41.667,00:59:42.917,Ha!
00:59:44.667,00:59:47.542,Not the game!
00:59:55.458,00:59:57.917,"Why didn't you grab the game, Peter?"
00:59:57.917,00:59:59.875,"Just ignore him, honey."
00:59:59.875,01:00:01.083,Where are you going?
01:00:01.083,01:00:02.333,He'll head for water.
01:00:03.333,01:00:05.417,Here we go. Come on.
01:00:05.417,01:00:06.792,Hello?
01:00:06.792,01:00:08.500,Where have you been?
01:00:08.500,01:00:11.125,You have the wrong number.
01:00:14.000,01:00:15.291,Wait for me!
01:00:33.458,01:00:34.542,What can I do for you?
01:00:34.542,01:00:36.750,I want a gross of these.
01:00:36.750,01:00:40.542,You know they stopped making these in 1903?
01:00:40.542,01:00:41.959,Damn.
01:00:41.959,01:00:44.083,Then I shall need a replacement weapon.
01:00:44.083,01:00:45.750,"Well, there's a waiting period."
01:00:45.750,01:00:49.917,And you'll have to fill out these.
01:00:51.834,01:00:53.250,Or I could fill these out.
01:00:53.250,01:00:54.750,Louise.
01:01:00.667,01:01:04.542,"Now, anyone asks, you didn't get this here."
01:01:08.333,01:01:11.667,"You're not a postal worker, are you?"
01:01:14.458,01:01:16.500,SARAH: Alan!
01:01:19.208,01:01:20.542,ALAN: Quiet.
01:01:27.417,01:01:29.125,Yeah... Ow!
01:01:29.125,01:01:30.667,Oh! Ow!
01:01:31.625,01:01:33.667,Okay.
01:01:36.667,01:01:38.250,Here.
01:01:42.166,01:01:43.250,No!
01:01:45.291,01:01:46.792,Hey!
01:01:49.458,01:01:50.542,BOTH: Peter!
01:02:55.834,01:02:58.667,SARAH: Peter! Are you okay?
01:02:58.667,01:03:01.125,JUDY: I can't believe you did that! That was so cool.
01:03:01.125,01:03:04.542,"You gave me chills! Oh, my God!"
01:03:05.625,01:03:07.458,Alan.
01:03:07.458,01:03:08.750,It's nice work.
01:03:08.750,01:03:10.917,"Come on, give me the game."
01:03:23.834,01:03:25.625,Ah!
01:03:28.875,01:03:29.875,"ALAN: Oh, no."
01:03:29.875,01:03:32.667,Act natural.
01:03:36.834,01:03:37.917,Hey!
01:03:39.000,01:03:41.917,Hide the game.
01:03:44.834,01:03:46.417,I don't believe this.
01:03:46.417,01:03:48.834,"Every time there's trouble, I run into you."
01:03:48.834,01:03:51.291,Me? I don't know what you're talking about.
01:03:51.291,01:03:52.875,I'm taking you in for questioning.
01:03:52.875,01:03:54.792,I'm not going anywhere. Oh! Ah!
01:03:55.792,01:03:57.750,Just...j-j...
01:03:57.750,01:03:59.834,ALAN: Oh!
01:03:59.834,01:04:01.166,SARAH: Just a second.
01:04:01.166,01:04:02.667,You can't take him.
01:04:02.667,01:04:03.834,Her fiancé.
01:04:03.834,01:04:05.625,I thought you said he's your uncle.
01:04:07.125,01:04:08.750,It's all right.
01:04:13.792,01:04:15.417,Blast!
01:04:15.417,01:04:18.250,Remember you said you'd never abandon your friends?
01:04:18.250,01:04:20.291,We'll finish the game later.
01:04:20.291,01:04:21.959,Later?
01:04:23.834,01:04:26.834,I suggest you all go home now.
01:04:26.834,01:04:28.500,Okay.
01:04:32.959,01:04:35.834,Now how are we supposed to finish the game?
01:04:35.834,01:04:38.917,We can't.
01:04:38.917,01:04:40.125,Judy!
01:04:40.125,01:04:42.917,What?
01:04:44.250,01:04:45.959,What happened?
01:04:45.959,01:04:49.417,I thought I could end the game myself. I was 10 spaces away.
01:04:49.417,01:04:52.083,A law of Jumanji hadn't been broken.
01:04:52.083,01:04:54.834,You will slip back even more than your token.
01:04:54.834,01:04:57.583,You tried to cheat?
01:04:57.583,01:05:00.792,No! I tried to drop the dice so they'd land on 12.
01:05:00.792,01:05:03.208,"Oh, okay, honey."
01:05:04.834,01:05:06.500,Peter! Your hands!
01:05:06.500,01:05:07.667,Look at your hands!
01:05:33.709,01:05:35.583,Come in. This is Willie.
01:05:35.583,01:05:37.542,They've cleaned out Larry's Hardware.
01:05:37.542,01:05:39.166,"I can't stop them, Lorraine."
01:05:39.166,01:05:42.291,You've got to get the National Guard down here now.
01:05:42.291,01:05:44.875,All right. What is this about?
01:05:44.875,01:05:46.625,"Yes, I do."
01:05:46.625,01:05:48.750,"But you wouldn't believe me even if I told you, Carl."
01:05:48.750,01:05:50.125,"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
01:05:50.125,01:05:52.166,How did you know my name is Carl?
01:05:52.166,01:05:53.834,I know a lot more than that.
01:05:53.834,01:05:56.959,I know you used to work on the stamping line at Parrish Shoes.
01:05:56.959,01:05:58.875,They used to call you Sole Man.
01:06:00.041,01:06:01.875,Sole Man!
01:06:01.875,01:06:05.333,"I was in there too, man, till old man Parrish fired me."
01:06:05.333,01:06:07.417,Fired you?
01:06:07.417,01:06:11.625,And I had something-- I could have turned this whole town around.
01:06:11.625,01:06:13.875,Your shoes.
01:06:13.875,01:06:17.208,"Listen, Carl..."
01:06:17.208,01:06:22.083,"I know it doesn't mean much after 26 years, but I'm sorry."
01:06:22.083,01:06:23.834,I'm sorry.
01:06:24.834,01:06:25.834,Sorry for what?
01:06:25.834,01:06:28.625,"It's me, Alan."
01:06:32.667,01:06:34.709,SARAH: Thank you. Come on.
01:06:34.709,01:06:36.417,What's going on?
01:06:36.417,01:06:39.875,"Well, apparently there's a sale, honey. Whoa!"
01:06:44.500,01:06:47.792,"You just saw three monkeys go by on a motorcycle, didn't you?"
01:06:47.792,01:06:49.667,Yes.
01:06:50.625,01:06:54.166,"Well, maybe we can bail him out with a check."
01:06:54.166,01:06:55.750,Hey.
01:06:55.750,01:07:06.625,"Tell that sniveling coward from me, if he wants-- VAN PELT: Hey!"
01:07:06.625,01:07:07.917,Get out of my way!
01:07:59.667,01:08:02.709,Give me that...boy!
01:08:02.709,01:08:05.792,Hey! Hey!
01:08:05.792,01:08:07.041,Help me!
01:08:07.041,01:08:09.834,Get me out of here!
01:08:09.834,01:08:12.750,SARAH: It's all right.
01:08:24.250,01:08:26.917,All right.
01:08:40.750,01:08:42.125,JUDY: There it is!
01:08:42.125,01:08:44.625,Wait here.
01:08:52.959,01:08:54.834,"Got you, girlie."
01:08:54.834,01:08:56.542,No.
01:08:56.542,01:08:59.458,"When Alan hears of your predicament, he'll come."
01:08:59.458,01:09:02.166,"You know, he doesn't even know I'm here, so your plan's ruined."
01:09:02.166,01:09:03.166,I'm going.
01:09:05.750,01:09:07.750,"Don't move, or I'll blow your brains out!"
01:09:07.750,01:09:08.834,"SARAH: Okay, okay."
01:09:08.834,01:09:10.750,WOMAN: Call the cops!
01:09:10.750,01:09:12.917,That should do the trick.
01:09:13.959,01:09:14.917,Ahh!
01:09:14.917,01:09:15.959,Arggh!
01:09:15.959,01:09:17.875,God!
01:09:17.875,01:09:19.083,Price check!
01:09:19.083,01:09:20.166,Argh!
01:09:22.959,01:09:27.750,"If you let me go, I can stop all this."
01:09:27.750,01:09:30.208,"It sounds like The Twilight Zone, but it's true, all right?"
01:09:30.208,01:09:31.792,Please.
01:09:31.792,01:09:32.875,You've got to help me on this.
01:09:32.875,01:09:34.583,I know I'm going to regret this.
01:09:36.625,01:09:37.834,Just hold still.
01:09:37.834,01:09:38.834,Mm-hm.
01:09:40.834,01:09:42.917,There. I let you go.
01:09:42.917,01:09:45.542,Now what are we going to do?
01:09:45.542,01:09:47.291,You are going to stay.
01:09:47.291,01:09:48.875,It's for your own good.
01:09:48.875,01:09:50.166,Where's my handcuff keys?
01:09:50.166,01:09:52.458,This is something I have to do!
01:09:52.458,01:09:53.458,Alan!
01:09:53.458,01:09:54.750,You'll thank me someday.
01:09:54.750,01:09:56.125,"Carl, code red."
01:09:56.125,01:09:59.333,Hostage situation at Sir Sav-a-lot involving woman and two children.
01:09:59.333,01:10:02.792,Sounds like the armed perpetrator in the pith helmet you reported earlier.
01:10:02.792,01:10:05.000,"Carl? Come in, Carl."
01:10:05.000,01:10:06.083,"Lorraine, come in! Lorraine?"
01:10:06.083,01:10:07.125,What's Sir Sav-a-lot?
01:10:07.125,01:10:08.083,It's a discount store.
01:10:08.083,01:10:09.375,Move over.
01:10:09.375,01:10:10.625,"Wait...gently, gently."
01:10:10.625,01:10:11.834,All right! All right.
01:10:13.166,01:10:15.125,Don't worry.
01:10:21.208,01:10:24.917,CARL: Aahhh!
01:10:40.875,01:10:42.250,Where's Sir Sav-a-lot?
01:10:42.250,01:10:43.750,Monroe and Elm.
01:10:43.750,01:10:44.834,The Episcopal church.
01:10:44.834,01:10:46.166,It's not a church anymore.
01:10:46.166,01:10:48.000,Now it's a Speedy Burger.
01:10:48.000,01:10:49.375,I don't know what's left of it.
01:10:49.375,01:10:51.083,People in this town are going loopy.
01:10:51.083,01:10:53.083,Judy!
01:11:03.667,01:11:05.625,Uh-oh. We've got company.
01:11:05.625,01:11:06.834,"No, no, no. It's all right."
01:11:06.834,01:11:08.667,That's a traffic cop.
01:11:33.959,01:11:35.125,Oh!
01:11:37.834,01:11:39.250,Arggh!
01:11:53.834,01:11:55.375,Arggh!
01:12:01.750,01:12:02.875,Here's the game.
01:12:02.875,01:12:04.250,"Come on, get out of here."
01:12:09.250,01:12:10.917,Right!
01:12:30.500,01:12:32.041,Turn the siren off.
01:12:32.041,01:12:34.458,Okay. I got it.
01:12:41.083,01:12:42.500,"Stop your cringing, woman."
01:12:42.500,01:12:44.291,I could've shot you at any moment.
01:12:44.291,01:12:45.750,Then why didn't you?
01:12:45.750,01:12:48.542,You didn't roll the dice.
01:12:48.542,01:12:49.667,"There it is, there it is."
01:12:50.792,01:12:52.000,Hit the brakes!
01:12:52.000,01:12:54.166,I'm hitting them.
01:12:54.166,01:12:55.667,Hit the brakes!
01:12:55.667,01:12:56.667,I am hitting the brakes!
01:12:56.667,01:12:57.709,BOTH: Arggh!
01:12:57.709,01:12:59.083,He should be here any moment.

01:13:22.917,01:13:24.125,You're all right.
01:13:24.125,01:13:25.542,Where's Peter?
01:13:25.542,01:13:28.583,I'm here!
01:13:28.583,01:13:31.542,"Oh, great."
01:13:34.041,01:13:38.625,"So remember, circumstances are never ever out of your control."
01:13:40.333,01:13:41.417,End of tape three.
01:13:42.959,01:13:53.625,"WOMAN: To update on the extraordinary events unfolding in Brantford, New Hampshire, where 98 people have been hospitalized with symptoms ranging from inexplicable fevers and rashes to violent seizures."

01:14:48.000,01:14:49.875,I got it.
01:14:51.333,01:14:54.291,"Alan, talk to him...please?"
01:14:54.291,01:14:56.792,"What? We don't have time for this, okay?"
01:14:56.792,01:15:00.875,"I know, but he's a kid, and he was trying to help."
01:15:00.875,01:15:02.125,All right. Come on.
01:15:02.125,01:15:03.291,Thank you.
01:15:03.291,01:15:05.333,Judy? Come on.
01:15:07.291,01:15:09.917,"I warned you about this, Peter."
01:15:09.917,01:15:11.583,"But, no, you wanted to play the game."
01:15:13.917,01:15:15.667,"What, are you crying?"
01:15:15.667,01:15:17.917,"You don't cry, all right?"
01:15:17.917,01:15:18.959,Come on! Keep your chin up!
01:15:20.542,01:15:23.667,"Crying never helped anybody do anything, okay?"
01:15:24.875,01:15:28.208,"If you have a problem, you face it like a man."
01:15:34.291,01:15:37.000,"Hey, hey."
01:15:37.000,01:15:38.750,I'm sorry.
01:15:38.750,01:15:43.792,"Twenty-six years buried in the deepest, darkest jungle, and I still became my father."
01:15:43.792,01:15:48.083,"It's okay. Come here, I'm sorry."
01:15:48.083,01:15:51.458,Remember what you told me?
01:15:51.458,01:15:56.583,It's not that.
01:16:03.834,01:16:05.959,Oh!
01:16:05.959,01:16:11.291,Okay. Ready?
01:16:12.417,01:16:14.583,Don't worry.
01:16:14.583,01:16:25.834,"We're going to have you turned back into your old self in no time flat, because we're going in here, and together, we're going to sit down, we're going to finish that game, no matter..."
01:16:25.834,01:16:27.333,...what.
01:16:39.166,01:16:42.333,Suddenly I feel right at home.
01:17:14.625,01:17:16.834,"Lorraine, this is Carl."
01:17:16.834,01:17:18.375,I know who's behind this.
01:17:18.375,01:17:20.458,I'm heading to the Parrish place. I need backup.
01:17:22.875,01:17:24.917,Lorraine?
01:17:27.917,01:17:30.834,Wait. Wait!
01:17:30.834,01:17:32.667,Now what?
01:17:32.667,01:17:33.834,Stop!
01:17:33.834,01:17:35.625,Wait. Stop.
01:17:39.458,01:17:40.750,"Is there a problem, ma'am?"
01:17:40.750,01:17:42.458,"Oh, can I have a ride home?"
01:17:42.458,01:17:43.458,Where do you live?
01:17:43.458,01:17:44.458,Jefferson Street.
01:17:44.458,01:17:46.000,The old Parrish place.
01:17:46.000,01:17:49.250,Do you have children?
01:17:49.250,01:17:50.542,"Oh, my God. What happened?"
01:17:50.542,01:17:51.709,Get in.
01:17:51.709,01:17:53.375,I'll explain it all on the way.
01:17:54.458,01:18:24.542,Calm d-- Fine! Take it!
01:18:24.542,01:18:27.917,We got to get to that house.
01:18:32.917,01:18:34.500,Shouldn't we play someplace else?
01:18:34.500,01:18:37.208,No. I grew up in this.
01:18:37.208,01:18:38.917,It's out there that scares me.
01:18:40.041,01:18:41.375,"SARAH: Okay, it's my turn."
01:18:41.375,01:18:42.792,Sarah?

01:18:46.542,01:18:49.000,"Okay, ready? Here I go."
01:18:53.166,01:18:54.500,It's okay.
01:18:54.500,01:19:02.041,"Every month at the quarter moon, there'll be a monsoon in your lagoon."
01:19:02.041,01:19:03.750,A monsoon.
01:19:03.750,01:19:05.542,"Well, at least we're inside."
01:19:07.709,01:19:09.667,"Yeah, right."
01:19:31.375,01:19:34.125,"Well, a little rain never hurt anybody."
01:19:34.125,01:19:35.875,"Yeah, but a lot can kill you."
01:19:35.875,01:19:38.667,Come on.
01:19:39.667,01:19:40.959,This way!
01:19:45.667,01:19:47.375,What do we do now?
01:19:47.375,01:19:49.166,We get to higher ground.
01:19:49.166,01:19:50.709,Okay.
01:19:50.709,01:19:52.083,Stay together!
01:19:52.083,01:19:53.917,Calmly.

01:21:42.417,01:21:44.500,"Uh, ma'am? Step back and let me handle this, please."
01:21:44.500,01:21:45.750,It's probably nothing.
01:21:45.750,01:21:47.917,They probably left the TV on too loud.
01:21:47.917,01:21:51.458,Peter! Judy!
01:21:52.625,01:21:53.792,I always wanted to do this.
01:21:53.792,01:21:56.166,"Could you step back, please?"

01:23:02.333,01:23:05.166,"Alan, you wrestled an alligator for me."
01:23:08.750,01:23:09.875,It was a crocodile.
01:23:09.875,01:23:13.834,Alligators don't have that little fringe on the hind leg.

01:32:51.291,01:32:55.083,It seems like a lot longer to me.
01:32:56.000,01:33:00.750,"Hey, I thought you told me, you were never going to talk to me again."
01:33:04.458,01:33:06.125,Yeah. I said that.
01:33:06.125,01:33:09.083,I'm sorry.
01:33:11.417,01:33:13.834,"Look, Alan..."
01:33:13.834,01:33:15.500,I was angry.
01:33:15.500,01:33:17.250,I'm sorry too.
01:33:17.250,01:33:19.542,I'm sorry.
01:33:21.959,01:33:27.500,"Look, you don't have to go to Cliffside if you don't want to."
01:33:30.041,01:33:32.041,Let's talk it over tomorrow...
01:33:32.041,01:33:34.041,man to man.
01:33:36.417,01:33:38.875,How about father to son?
01:33:39.834,01:33:42.709,Great.
01:33:42.709,01:33:45.542,"Hey, I've got to get going."
01:33:48.333,01:33:49.917,Dad?
01:33:53.500,01:34:00.458,"Back in 196-- I mean, today in the factory, it wasn't Carl Bentley's fault."
01:34:00.458,01:34:03.834,I put the shoe on the conveyer belt.
01:34:05.834,01:34:08.500,"I'm glad you told me, son."
01:34:08.500,01:34:10.542,Thanks.
01:34:11.625,01:34:13.542,"Goodbye, Dad."
01:34:13.542,01:34:16.125,Goodbye.
01:34:25.333,01:34:26.875,Holy smokes!
01:34:26.875,01:34:28.792,Alan...
01:34:29.709,01:34:31.458,...they're not there.
01:34:31.458,01:34:35.041,It's 1969.
01:34:35.041,01:34:37.959,They don't even exist yet.
01:35:07.625,01:35:10.333,I'm starting to forget what it's like to be a grownup.
01:35:10.333,01:35:14.291,That's okay. As long as we don't forget each other.
01:35:14.291,01:35:15.917,Or Judy and Peter.
01:35:17.458,01:35:20.333,"Alan, there's something I've been wanting to do."
01:35:20.333,01:35:25.000,And I'd better do it before I feel too much like a kid.
01:35:44.166,01:35:47.750,"They probably don't teach driver training in the sixth grade, huh?"
01:36:14.375,01:36:15.625,"No, Dad, no."
01:36:15.625,01:36:16.792,It's a new cross-trainer.
01:36:16.792,01:36:17.917,It's doing fabulous.
01:36:17.917,01:36:19.208,It's not a bra.
01:36:19.208,01:36:20.375,"Honey, they're here."
01:36:20.375,01:36:22.083,"Listen, Dad, I've got to run."
01:36:22.083,01:36:24.500,Merry Christmas. We'll pick you up tomorrow at the airport.
01:36:24.500,01:36:27.625,It'll be the best Christmas gift. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
01:36:27.625,01:36:28.792,They're here?
01:36:28.792,01:36:31.208,"Yeah. Come on, let's go."
01:36:31.208,01:36:32.834,"Hello, Henry."
01:36:32.834,01:36:34.667,Pardon me!
01:36:34.667,01:36:36.834,"Jim, glad you could make it."
01:36:36.834,01:36:38.583,Thanks.
01:36:38.583,01:36:39.959,Pleased to meet you.
01:36:39.959,01:36:42.208,"Hi, Sarah."
01:36:42.208,01:36:45.041,"Oh, my God."
01:36:45.041,01:36:47.709,How did you know?
01:36:47.709,01:36:51.250,"A guess. A guess, of course."
01:36:51.250,01:36:53.625,"JIM: Well, you're right."
01:36:53.625,01:36:54.959,Judy and Peter.
01:36:54.959,01:36:56.834,"Kids, say hi to Mr. and Mrs. Parrish."
01:36:56.834,01:36:58.333,Nice to meet you.
01:36:58.333,01:37:01.417,Nice to meet you.
01:37:01.417,01:37:03.208,You're just like we remembered you.
01:37:06.667,01:37:12.250,"I feel like we know so much about them, because, you know-- SARAH: You've told Al about them."
01:37:12.250,01:37:13.709,ALAN: And I told her.
01:37:13.709,01:37:15.083,Yeah.
01:37:15.083,01:37:17.834,I'll go and get the presents.
01:37:17.834,01:37:19.709,"Well, we love children."
01:37:19.709,01:37:20.834,Merry Christmas.
01:37:20.834,01:37:22.291,Cool!
01:37:25.583,01:37:26.583,So when can you start?
01:37:26.583,01:37:31.208,"Well, actually, Martha and I were thinking of taking a little skiing holiday up in the Canadian Rockies."
01:37:31.208,01:37:32.917,BOTH: No!
01:37:35.041,01:37:36.417,ALAN: Sorry.
01:37:36.417,01:37:38.208,We... We just...
01:37:38.208,01:37:41.834,We need you to get that marketing done on the new line pronto.
01:37:41.834,01:37:44.291,No problem. No problem.
01:37:44.291,01:37:46.750,"You know, I can probably start next week."
01:37:46.750,01:37:50.834,"Let me introduce you to the folks around here you'll be working with, okay?"
01:37:50.834,01:37:51.834,Come on in.
01:37:51.834,01:37:53.333,Our house was your house.
01:37:53.333,01:37:55.542,Is! Anytime you like.
01:37:55.542,01:37:57.417,GUESTS:.
