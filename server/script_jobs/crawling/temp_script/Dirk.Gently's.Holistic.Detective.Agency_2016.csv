00:00:39.122,00:00:45.962,"I'm-- I'm on my way, is where I am, and almost there already, so everything's great."
00:02:05.792,00:02:09.921,"Dorian! Dorian! Dorian, stop! Stop!"
00:02:10.004,00:02:12.924,"Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop!"
00:02:13.007,00:02:15.385,"-Where's my money?! -I gave you your money, Dorian."
00:02:15.468,00:02:18.054,-Where's the goddamn rent? -I paid you the rent.
00:02:18.138,00:02:20.723,Don't tell me what you did or didn't do!
00:02:20.807,00:02:22.892,You don't know what happened yesterday. You're not a historian.
00:02:22.976,00:02:25.353,"-Okay, listen-- -Are you a historian?"
00:02:25.436,00:02:28.148,"-No, but-- -No! I want my money today!"
00:02:28.231,00:02:30.733,"Six hundred bucks, or I swear to God, I will kill you."
00:02:34.070,00:02:36.156,"What are you gonna do, call the cops?"
00:02:36.239,00:02:39.033,"Go ahead. No, you won't. You know why?"
00:02:39.117,00:02:43.204,'Cause I got you. I got you.
00:02:48.626,00:02:54.173,Money! I want my money! Today! My 600 bucks!
00:03:18.990,00:03:22.285,and could not be reached for comment at this time.
00:03:22.368,00:03:28.458,"If you or anyone you know has information on the whereabouts of Lydia Spring, please contact the number below."
00:03:46.476,00:03:49.854,"I swear to God, I will kill you! Where's my money?"
00:03:49.938,00:03:51.564,Are you a historian?
00:03:51.648,00:03:55.401,"Oh, Mr. Palacios-- Todd, perfect, I need you to get up to 745."
00:03:55.485,00:03:57.987,"-Yes, I will. I just-- -Welcome to the Perriman Grand."
00:04:00.240,00:04:03.451,"Uh, I was wondering if I could get my check a little early this month."
00:04:03.534,00:04:06.996,"-What? Why? Are you okay? -Yeah, I could just use the money."
00:04:07.080,00:04:09.249,I need you to get up to 745 right away.
00:04:09.332,00:04:11.417,There's a drunk woman up there acting crazy.
00:04:11.501,00:04:13.127,Do me a favor. Check out the penthouse.
00:04:13.211,00:04:16.547,They've had a Do Not Disturb since 2 p.m. yesterday.
00:04:16.631,00:04:19.926,"-You still have your master key? -No, I misplaced it."
00:04:20.009,00:04:21.177,Take mine.
00:04:21.261,00:04:23.429,Seven forty-five and then the penthouse.
00:04:23.513,00:04:25.348,Then we can talk about the check?
00:04:25.431,00:04:27.100,"Later, yes. Later. Hmm?"
00:04:27.809,00:04:28.935,Okay.
00:04:33.690,00:04:35.942,"-No, I was just-- -Get out of the way."
00:04:48.371,00:04:49.497,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:04:55.878,00:04:58.214,Oh. Do I have to leave?
00:04:59.841,00:05:01.634,Or could I just sit here for a second?
00:05:02.635,00:05:03.845,Take your time.
00:05:03.928,00:05:09.726,Can you just hang out... with me... for a second?
00:05:26.451,00:05:27.410,I hate men.
00:05:27.910,00:05:30.204,I'll be out of here in an hour.
00:05:30.288,00:05:31.122,Okay.
00:05:31.205,00:05:32.874,"If you need anything, my name is..."
00:05:34.042,00:05:35.168,Todd.
00:05:47.847,00:05:49.557,"Listen, I'm not ignoring you."
00:05:49.640,00:05:52.226,I don't know if I have the money right now.
00:05:52.310,00:05:57.148,"And I know I promised you, but there have been some unforeseen circumstances."
00:05:57.231,00:06:02.695,"I'm gonna get you the money, -and you'll be able-- -Time machine! No, you lied to me."
00:06:02.779,00:06:04.864,You lied to me. You've screwed both of us.
00:06:04.947,00:06:07.575,"No! Silence! No! No, you shut up! Don't you say a word."
00:06:07.658,00:06:18.920,I don't wanna hear-- holy shit. This is when it happened. That means-- Come on!
00:06:28.221,00:06:29.847,"Where the hell are you, Todd?"
00:06:33.184,00:06:35.436,Have you checked out the penthouse?
00:06:35.520,00:06:38.940,"I mean, I'm on my way. I'm on my way."
00:07:45.673,00:07:48.676,Estevez. Zimmerfield. Missing Persons.
00:07:48.759,00:07:53.723,Missing Persons? This is a homicide or... something.
00:07:54.474,00:07:57.351,-We believe this homicide has possible-- -Probable.
00:07:57.435,00:07:59.896,-Probable ties to an ongoing case-- -Wait.
00:08:00.897,00:08:02.106,What do you mean or something?
00:08:11.073,00:08:12.116,It is strange in here.
00:08:15.912,00:08:17.163,Are those burns?
00:08:20.833,00:08:23.753,Homicide said the guy in the bed was torn in half.
00:08:24.420,00:08:28.758,The other guy had his arm torn off. There are bite marks on the ceiling.
00:08:30.009,00:08:33.012,"So, what are looking for, like, an animal, or a weapon?"
00:08:33.095,00:08:35.681,There are multiple bite marks on the ceiling.
00:08:35.765,00:08:37.683,They say the noise went on for ten seconds.
00:08:37.767,00:08:39.977,"Zim, what the hell does this in ten seconds?"
00:08:40.728,00:08:44.857,A man was bitten in half. Bitten in half?
00:08:47.610,00:08:49.820,"-They say they got a witness. -Oh, yeah?"
00:08:52.114,00:08:53.241,How big are his teeth?
00:08:56.244,00:08:57.078,No.
00:08:59.372,00:09:02.250,"Late to work, late getting to the penthouse, no key."
00:09:02.333,00:09:04.835,"-It all seems very, you know... -Confluent."
00:09:06.629,00:09:09.924,Like a lot of little pieces adding up to me raising my eyebrows like...
00:09:10.925,00:09:11.759,Like that.
00:09:12.593,00:09:14.512,"See, I can't do it. Only Zimmerfield can."
00:09:14.595,00:09:16.389,Only Zimmerfield.
00:09:17.515,00:09:21.852,"Security tapes are badly scrambled due to power fluctuations, but we did manage to pull this."
00:09:24.730,00:09:27.817,This is from under two minutes before you arrived in the penthouse.
00:09:29.193,00:09:30.319,Is that your key?
00:09:30.987,00:09:34.031,"I don't think so. Wait, is he wearing a gorilla mask?"
00:09:34.949,00:09:39.078,"You didn't see anything weird this morning, did you, Mr. Brotzman?"
00:09:40.621,00:09:42.415,Yes. No.
00:09:45.251,00:09:47.211,Maybe. I don't know.
00:09:47.295,00:09:50.464,Are you aware you just gave every possible response to that question?
00:09:50.548,00:09:51.424,Eyebrows.
00:09:54.176,00:09:56.971,"If I were you, I wouldn't leave town. Hmm?"
00:09:58.097,00:10:06.272,Is there-- Is there any way you could get the security footage for the 18th floor?
00:10:10.318,00:10:13.279,"See, I told you that the security footage was badly scrambled."
00:10:13.362,00:10:15.990,"Any particular reason you want that, Todd?"
00:10:16.073,00:10:18.242,Did something happen on the 18th floor?
00:10:18.993,00:10:22.705,"No, I-- Okay, no."
00:10:23.623,00:10:27.460,"You didn't touch anything at the scene, did you, Todd?"
00:10:28.002,00:10:28.878,No.
00:10:32.006,00:10:34.675,-Don't leave town. -I won't.
00:10:35.343,00:10:38.512,Seriously. Don't leave town.
00:10:41.891,00:10:42.767,Okay.
00:10:53.819,00:10:55.863,"Yeah, sorry, what?"
00:10:55.946,00:10:58.532,I said they think it's connected to something bigger.
00:10:59.492,00:11:01.994,"-What, like the mob? -No."
00:11:04.455,00:11:06.666,"While you were in there, did you see an animal?"
00:11:06.749,00:11:10.294,-Animal? No. -They said they found paw prints.
00:11:10.378,00:11:13.255,Paw prints? Like a dog?
00:11:14.548,00:11:15.383,No.
00:11:16.926,00:11:18.677,"-Also, you're fired. -What?"
00:11:18.761,00:11:20.721,"Your involvement in all of this, it's complicated."
00:11:20.805,00:11:24.725,-You can't fire me. I just opened a door. -Some doors shouldn't be opened.
00:11:24.809,00:11:26.560,"Okay, is there any way, please?"
00:11:26.644,00:11:31.065,"Is there any way you can give me my final check today, -as a type of severance? -It's a same-day termination."
00:11:31.148,00:11:32.817,I'd have to delay the check.
00:11:32.900,00:11:34.985,What do you mean same day? It just happened today.
00:11:35.069,00:11:37.029,Today is the day that it happened.
00:11:37.113,00:11:43.369,"Any day that it would've happened would've been the day it happened-- -Listen, I need the money. -Yes, but it's a same-day termination."
00:11:43.452,00:11:46.414,"It's always a day, right? Things happen when they happen."
00:11:46.497,00:11:51.585,"They happen immediately. That's what happening is-- Sometimes when things happen, they don't happen."
00:12:47.475,00:12:48.434,Hi.
00:13:01.489,00:13:02.990,Ow!
00:13:03.073,00:13:06.076,"Right, now you're gonna get... Hyah! Hi-ya!"
00:13:13.584,00:13:16.545,Stop it. Jesus! With the-- Push!
00:13:16.629,00:13:18.255,"What the hell, man?"
00:13:18.339,00:13:20.966,You What the hell? No! Me What the hell?
00:13:21.050,00:13:23.469,"-How did you get in here? -The window, obviously."
00:13:23.552,00:13:25.429,Do you attack everyone who comes in here?
00:13:25.513,00:13:27.389,"Seems like a weird thing to do, but live and let live."
00:13:27.473,00:13:29.892,"-You can't just break into my apartment. -Clearly, I can."
00:13:29.975,00:13:31.936,I'll call the police. Hey.
00:13:32.019,00:13:36.899,"I'm trying to decide whether you're a clue, an accomplice or an assistant."
00:13:36.982,00:13:38.817,Who are you? What is this?
00:13:38.901,00:13:41.821,Have you noticed an acceleration of strangeness in your life as of late?
00:13:41.904,00:13:49.036,"Perhaps a series of intense or extraordinary events, which, as of now, seem unconnected, with the exception of each being separately bizarre?"
00:13:49.119,00:13:59.922,"Perhaps every day before now has, for the most part, been humdrum and inane, your life a mundane, unvarying slog through unfulfilling jobs, shallow depression and boring, boring sex?"
00:14:00.005,00:14:03.008,"And then suddenly, today, everything changed..."
00:14:03.759,00:14:07.012,and your life became a swirl of interesting activity?
00:14:09.640,00:14:11.433,An assistant. I knew it.
00:14:13.310,00:14:15.938,"Oh, my name is Dirk Gently. I'm a detective."
00:14:16.021,00:14:20.192,I live here now and... Ooh. I'll be sleeping here tonight.
00:14:35.791,00:14:38.127,Project Icarus is leaving the building.
00:14:39.420,00:14:42.172,-What about the other guy? -I don't know yet.
00:14:42.256,00:14:43.757,-What? -What?
00:14:44.341,00:14:46.135,It's hard to hear you through the comm.
00:14:46.218,00:14:48.721,I'm not talking through the comm. I'm talking to you.
00:14:50.222,00:14:51.140,I've got a shot.
00:14:51.223,00:14:53.517,-What do you mean? -Do I take the shot?
00:14:53.601,00:14:56.103,"-Don't take the shot. -Confirmed, taking the shot."
00:15:01.775,00:15:03.527,What the hell are you doing?
00:15:03.611,00:15:06.906,You are endangering the whole goddamn operation.
00:15:44.735,00:15:46.028,What the hell just happened?
00:15:47.655,00:15:51.116,-Who were those guys? -Plates came up military.
00:15:52.576,00:15:58.165,"Is the guy we're tailing meeting up with another guy, who is also being tailed by other people?"
00:16:18.477,00:16:20.771,I let everyone down.
00:16:21.772,00:16:23.774,"Stupid, stupid, stupid!"
00:16:25.442,00:16:28.278,I'm so bored. My life sucks.
00:16:29.113,00:16:30.739,"Is it bad, or..."
00:16:30.823,00:16:33.117,"No, I mean, a little better today."
00:16:33.200,00:16:34.743,Maybe it'll keep getting better.
00:16:35.869,00:16:39.957,Didn't you say that it started out feeling better a little bit at a time when it happened to you?
00:16:40.040,00:16:44.837,"-Yeah, a little bit, but-- -Don't worry, I'm not getting my hopes up."
00:16:45.838,00:16:49.800,Remember when we were little when Aunt Esther would have good days and bad days?
00:16:51.510,00:16:53.804,"Yeah, I just remember the bad days."
00:16:55.431,00:16:57.182,"Hey, I'm coming up tomorrow."
00:16:57.266,00:16:59.351,Your message said you didn't have the money.
00:16:59.435,00:17:02.396,"Yeah, well, I'll figure something out, okay?"
00:17:03.063,00:17:05.607,-I'll figure it out. -You seem stressed out.
00:17:06.567,00:17:07.943,Is everything okay over there?
00:17:11.321,00:17:13.115,-Money! -Don't leave town.
00:17:13.198,00:17:14.324,"-Also, you're fired. -Hyah!"
00:17:16.493,00:17:19.371,"No, I-- Everything's fine."
00:17:42.853,00:17:46.648,"-Hurry up! -I'm going as fast as I can, okay?"
00:17:47.191,00:17:49.193,"Look, it's not easy doing this under pressure."
00:17:49.777,00:17:52.404,"Plus, I've never worked with this kind of rigging before."
00:18:28.315,00:18:29.858,This is private property.
00:18:52.214,00:18:53.882,"No, no, no."
00:18:56.301,00:18:59.304,No. Stay away! No!
00:19:00.472,00:19:02.933,"Somebody, help me!"
00:19:03.559,00:19:04.935,Please!
00:19:13.193,00:19:15.112,"Oh, God. No!"
00:19:29.793,00:19:30.669,Please...
00:19:32.087,00:19:34.381,"Dirk Gently, you are a dead man."
00:19:36.800,00:19:39.303,Who's-- Who's Dirk Gently?
00:19:40.846,00:19:43.682,-You're not Dirk Gently? -No.
00:19:47.978,00:19:50.856,"What, are you kidding me right now? Then why did you run?"
00:19:50.939,00:19:54.151,You have a machete. And you killed Red.
00:19:54.234,00:19:56.486,"Why didn't you just say, I'm not Dirk Gently?"
00:19:56.570,00:19:58.488,Because I don't know who that is!
00:19:58.572,00:19:59.781,Hi.
00:20:01.992,00:20:04.036,-What are you still doing here? -What are you doing here?
00:20:04.119,00:20:06.496,"-I live here. -Right, but where are you going?"
00:20:06.580,00:20:10.417,"-Didn't you say you lost your job? -No, I didn't say that, actually."
00:20:10.500,00:20:12.669,-How do you-- -I'm a detective. I'm on a case.
00:20:12.753,00:20:15.255,You worked at that hotel where the murders took place.
00:20:15.339,00:20:20.385,"Been all over the news, for people who still watch the news, old people, and me, occasionally."
00:20:20.469,00:20:22.429,-Was I on TV? -Would it be bad for you if you were?
00:20:22.512,00:20:24.181,-None of your business. -Maybe it is.
00:20:24.264,00:20:25.891,"-No, it isn't. -Where are you going?"
00:20:25.974,00:20:28.518,-None of your business. -You don't even know my business.
00:20:28.602,00:20:31.772,-Maybe I'm a cab driver. -You just said you were on a case.
00:20:32.397,00:20:34.024,Maybe I have two jobs.
00:20:35.067,00:20:37.986,-Leave me alone. -But maybe-- -No. -Where?
00:20:38.070,00:20:41.240,"-My sister's house, okay? -I'll give you a ride."
00:20:41.949,00:20:43.075,What's your alternative?
00:20:43.158,00:20:45.786,Unless you have some kind of magic car-fixing robot.
00:20:45.869,00:20:48.038,"You don't, though. I've seen in your apartment."
00:20:51.250,00:20:53.961,"-It's an hour away. -Pfft. Time, I laugh at the concept."
00:20:54.044,00:20:56.505,I can spend a whole day without even trying.
00:20:56.588,00:20:59.174,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Where are you going?"
00:21:01.385,00:21:03.512,Where's my rent? Todd? Where's my rent money?
00:21:03.595,00:21:06.640,"-Careful, it's not my car. -I paid you, Dorian."
00:21:06.723,00:21:08.475,You paid me? Do I look like an accountant to you?
00:21:08.558,00:21:10.519,Do I look like I know how much you paid me?
00:21:10.602,00:21:12.396,"-Shit. Go, go, go. -Dirk!"
00:21:13.146,00:21:14.356,Make sure he comes back with my money.
00:21:16.400,00:21:33.792,What the-- They're going to bounce this case to Major Crimes unless we can turn up something to connect this to Lydia Spring and soon.
00:21:33.875,00:21:35.210,Anybody find that kitten?
00:21:35.294,00:21:36.420,-With the bloody-- -Yeah.
00:21:36.503,00:21:41.258,"No, but uniforms found a hole in a wall in a stairwell adjacent to the penthouse."
00:21:41.925,00:21:45.554,"Went through the electrical system, some kind of pulse, blew up the whole deal."
00:21:45.637,00:21:47.431,-What could've caused that? -Lightning strike.
00:21:48.015,00:21:50.309,-Did that happen? -Nope. Checked the lightning rods.
00:21:50.392,00:21:53.186,-They still have lightning rods? -As long as they have lightning.
00:21:53.770,00:21:55.188,"Where was the security, Zim?"
00:21:56.398,00:21:58.442,Patrick Spring always rolled with bodyguards.
00:21:58.525,00:21:59.901,We should talk to Farah Black again.
00:21:59.985,00:22:02.112,We got her on file from when Lydia first went missing.
00:22:05.699,00:22:08.910,"This is connected to Lydia. It has to be, right?"
00:22:09.494,00:22:14.708,"Rich girl fights with her father, goes missing, -less than one week later, he's dead? -Could be a coincidence."
00:22:14.791,00:22:16.251,That would be ridiculous.
00:22:17.336,00:22:20.797,-Like bite marks on the ceiling? -Like bite marks on the ceiling.
00:22:21.506,00:22:22.549,What do you got there?
00:22:23.508,00:22:28.096,"Trying to find Monkey Mask on the tapes, trace his progress, but he knew where the cameras were."
00:22:28.180,00:22:30.140,Or he was already staying at the hotel.
00:22:30.223,00:22:32.476,"I did find one thing kind of interesting, though."
00:22:39.024,00:22:40.734,Whose dog is that?
00:22:55.207,00:22:58.460,"Come on. Relax, enjoy the ride. I think we'll be great friends."
00:22:58.543,00:23:00.629,I can already tell we've got oodles in common.
00:23:00.712,00:23:04.549,"We both like, um, eating, breathing. We both can walk."
00:23:04.633,00:23:07.010,There's an ocean of commonalities for us to draw on.
00:23:14.726,00:23:16.561,Oh. Right. I was talking to him this morning.
00:23:16.645,00:23:19.314,"-About what? -Your apartment building, the Ridgely."
00:23:19.397,00:23:21.316,"Fascinating history, that place."
00:23:28.740,00:23:30.242,Who are you?
00:23:30.325,00:23:35.539,"I'm a detective, a holistic detective, and before you ask, no, I'm not with the CIA anymore."
00:23:35.622,00:23:38.333,What is a holistic detective?
00:23:38.416,00:23:40.418,"I'm very glad you asked me that, Mr..."
00:23:41.044,00:23:43.338,-What's your name? -Todd.
00:23:43.421,00:23:45.215,"I'm very glad you asked me that, Todd."
00:23:45.298,00:23:50.428,The term holistic refers to my convictions about the fundamental interconnectedness of all things.
00:23:50.512,00:23:56.518,"I do not concern myself with such petty things as fingerprint powder, telltale pieces of pocket fluff and inane footprints."
00:23:57.561,00:23:59.479,You're a detective who doesn't find clues.
00:23:59.563,00:24:01.773,"That sounds, you know, insane."
00:24:01.857,00:24:06.444,I see the solution to each problem as being detectable in the pattern and web of the whole.
00:24:06.528,00:24:13.702,"The connections between causes and effects are often much more subtle than we, with our rough understanding of the physical world, might naturally suppose."
00:24:18.582,00:24:20.917,-New car. -I thought you said this wasn't your car.
00:24:21.668,00:24:23.253,Doesn't mean it isn't new.
00:24:37.684,00:24:40.020,It was good you decided to come with me.
00:24:44.232,00:24:48.069,I didn't decide anything. You said you'd kill me if I didn't come.
00:24:48.904,00:24:52.741,"Well, you decided it would be better to come with me than die."
00:24:55.535,00:24:56.536,That was nice.
00:25:03.376,00:25:05.253,We gotta stop for gas.
00:25:06.963,00:25:09.716,But you don't need gas.
00:25:11.801,00:25:12.969,Call it a hunch.
00:25:24.272,00:25:26.900,"Hey, hi, ho, hey, get up on the roof."
00:25:26.983,00:25:29.277,Get up on the roof where I can see you till I get back.
00:25:29.361,00:25:31.404,The roof? Won't this look suspicious?
00:25:36.284,00:25:37.494,"Ken, you're a riot."
00:25:42.332,00:25:43.291,Hmm.
00:25:59.015,00:26:01.560,-Did you just kill someone? -I'm an assassin.
00:26:01.643,00:26:04.020,"That's what I do, I kill people. You didn't notice?"
00:26:12.570,00:26:13.571,A what?
00:26:14.364,00:26:17.993,Holistic is the fundamental interconnectedness of all things.
00:26:18.076,00:26:23.415,"I don't do your whole deal with sniper rifles, poison or getting hired."
00:26:23.498,00:26:28.587,"I just kill whoever I feel like killing all day, and if I killed them, they were my target."
00:26:29.379,00:26:36.344,"The connection between cause and effect is much more, you know, subtle than you would otherwise think."
00:26:38.638,00:26:41.683,"I mean, you wouldn't believe it."
00:26:42.350,00:26:45.812,"Things, they double up. They parallel."
00:26:46.563,00:26:49.649,"Everything is chaos, but it's synchronized."
00:26:50.442,00:26:56.698,"It's like there's always something ready to mirror itself, life endlessly turning inward."
00:26:59.659,00:27:02.078,but that just sounds like a murder spree.
00:27:03.997,00:27:05.749,I've never killed the wrong person.
00:27:07.751,00:27:10.003,"I have killed a lot of people, though."
00:27:12.881,00:27:14.049,Get in the car.
00:27:16.301,00:27:20.472,"See? I didn't even ask you to do that, and you're already acting like an assistant."
00:27:21.348,00:27:24.976,I'm just trying to be helpful. It's not-- Whatever keeps you sane.
00:27:25.060,00:27:29.814,I've started to think you're more important to this case -than you realize. -What case?
00:27:29.898,00:27:31.691,You broke into my apartment.
00:27:31.775,00:27:35.654,How do you even investigate anything if you don't use any investigative stuff?
00:27:35.737,00:27:38.573,Interconnectedness. Coincidence.
00:27:38.656,00:27:41.201,"And the rarer, sexier coinky-dinks."
00:27:41.284,00:27:44.120,"Once hired, I am intrinsically connected to the specific case."
00:27:44.204,00:27:47.832,I then will eventually solve the mystery merely by just kind of doing whatever.
00:27:47.916,00:27:49.918,Who told you to break into my apartment?
00:27:50.001,00:27:55.882,"No one. I was investigating your building for other reasons, which will remain tangential. I had a hunch you might be important."
00:27:55.965,00:28:00.845,"Hey, and I was right. While searching your apartment, I found a very compelling piece of evidence."
00:28:00.929,00:28:03.640,-What did you find? -Nothing.
00:28:05.225,00:28:07.435,-But you just said-- -Everything is connected.
00:28:08.061,00:28:10.021,Nothing is also connected.
00:28:13.149,00:28:15.360,-Don't run any more red lights. -Whatever keeps you sane.
00:28:33.670,00:28:35.213,-Ring the bell. -What the hell?
00:28:36.131,00:28:37.715,You said you were gonna stay in the car.
00:28:37.799,00:28:39.300,"-I lied, though. -What?"
00:28:39.384,00:28:42.637,Did you see how I snuck up? I was trained as a ninja by the CIA.
00:28:42.721,00:28:44.806,"-What? -Sorry, that's a lie, too."
00:28:44.889,00:28:46.182,Just go back to the car.
00:28:47.350,00:28:50.687,"-Todd, you came. -Yeah, of course I came."
00:28:50.770,00:28:53.231,"-What, you didn't think I would come? -Who's this?"
00:28:53.314,00:28:55.984,"It's, uh... It's Dirk Gently."
00:28:56.943,00:28:58.778,"Dirk-- Okay, hi."
00:28:58.862,00:28:59.863,-Sorry. I'm Amanda. -Hi.
00:28:59.946,00:29:02.157,"-No, don't. -Don't say hello?"
00:29:02.240,00:29:03.616,"Hello, Amanda."
00:29:05.452,00:29:06.327,Are you friends?
00:29:06.411,00:29:07.245,-No. -Yes.
00:29:07.328,00:29:08.204,-No. -Yes.
00:29:09.497,00:29:11.958,-No. Yes. No. -We're very good friends.
00:29:12.041,00:29:13.334,Ow!
00:29:13.877,00:29:15.670,You're a terrible assis-friend.
00:29:21.384,00:29:32.353,"of billionaire entrepreneur Patrick Spring and several others an animal attack rather than a murder as was initially reported, though the nature of the animal remains undisclosed at this time."
00:29:32.437,00:29:35.315,Sources within the police department will neither confirm nor deny...
00:29:35.398,00:29:36.274,Hmm.
00:29:36.357,00:29:44.157,"...whether the tragic incident bears any connection to the recent disappearance of Spring's daughter, heiress Lydia Spring, now missing for over four days."
00:29:44.240,00:29:48.912,"Do you have any friends who can come by and just help you with this, cleaning up?"
00:29:48.995,00:29:54.000,It's hard to keep friends when you can't go outside without worrying a gust of wind will knock you down.
00:29:54.876,00:29:57.629,-I barely get out of the house anymore. -God.
00:29:59.172,00:30:01.174,Why don't you move back in with Mom and Dad?
00:30:01.257,00:30:03.843,"-Maybe they can help you. -You know they're broke, Todd."
00:30:04.344,00:30:05.929,I would just be a burden on them.
00:30:06.513,00:30:09.474,"-I'm a burden on everyone. -What's wrong with you, exactly?"
00:30:11.559,00:30:14.437,-I have pararibulitus. -Ah. Of course.
00:30:15.230,00:30:16.064,What's that?
00:30:16.648,00:30:19.567,-Who are you? -I'm Dirk Gently. I'm a private detective.
00:30:20.944,00:30:22.779,You don't look like a private detective.
00:30:22.862,00:30:24.739,No private detective looks like a private detective.
00:30:24.823,00:30:27.075,That's one of the first rules of private detection.
00:30:27.158,00:30:33.039,"But if no private detective looks like a private detective, how does a private detective know what he shouldn't look like?"
00:30:36.334,00:30:37.585,It's a nerve disease.
00:30:37.669,00:30:45.552,"It causes your brain to misinterpret certain inputs, and you actually have hallucinations that feel real, and in most cases, very painful."
00:30:45.635,00:30:49.222,"So, that means..."
00:30:49.305,00:30:51.266,Water on your hand could feel like fire.
00:30:51.349,00:30:53.351,Your shoe on your foot could feel like it was crushing it.
00:30:53.434,00:30:56.938,-Breathing could feel like drowning. -I'm sorry. That's terrible.
00:30:57.438,00:30:59.315,And so interesting.
00:31:00.567,00:31:03.653,"Yeah, well, it makes it hard to not be scared all the time."
00:31:04.863,00:31:09.075,"But Todd had it and he got better, so... I need to take my meds and eat healthy."
00:31:09.158,00:31:10.994,"So, then why do you stay in the house?"
00:31:11.077,00:31:11.953,What?
00:31:13.079,00:31:16.332,"If the disease is in you, why does it matter where you go?"
00:31:16.916,00:31:19.711,"Hey, uh, Amanda, do you wanna jam?"
00:31:22.255,00:31:23.923,Yeah. Of course.
00:31:29.470,00:31:31.222,Cool. I'll be there in a minute.
00:31:34.142,00:31:37.061,-Why are you doing this? -I'm on a case.
00:31:37.145,00:31:41.441,My primary method of investigation is to follow someone who looks like they know where they're going.
00:31:41.524,00:31:45.111,"Is it that important you not be identified as my friend, that you felt the need to argue?"
00:31:45.194,00:31:49.032,You are an insane person who's insinuated himself into my life in a moment of desperation.
00:31:49.115,00:31:53.786,I think you're an insane person who has insinuated himself into being my combination assistant and best friend.
00:31:53.870,00:31:57.749,"But that's-- it's-- Okay, that is not what's happening."
00:31:59.959,00:32:02.420,I have the primary and the secondary in my sights.
00:32:06.507,00:32:07.842,Uh-huh.
00:32:09.469,00:32:10.428,What?
00:32:11.095,00:32:15.016,I thought we were clear that the rifle isn't necessary.
00:32:15.600,00:32:21.814,"Yeah, but in the mishkin parambuler, it said that we have to prevent all aggressive action against the primary."
00:32:21.898,00:32:24.275,-The what? -The mission parameters.
00:32:24.359,00:32:25.526,That's not what you said.
00:32:26.194,00:32:28.988,"The gum went weird in my mouth, sir."
00:32:29.072,00:32:31.574,It made my tongue do a weird move and say stuff wrong.
00:32:34.285,00:32:36.788,What branch did they assign you to me from?
00:32:36.871,00:32:40.083,Provisional. They said you didn't have the budget for the op.
00:32:40.166,00:32:41.417,Okay.
00:32:41.501,00:32:46.923,Our goal is to observe and protect the primary.
00:32:47.006,00:32:50.802,Not to kill anyone.
00:32:50.885,00:32:53.972,Right. Understood.
00:33:01.562,00:33:02.397,I've got a shot.
00:33:10.655,00:33:11.864,Ah!
00:33:52.196,00:33:54.365,"Back off, okay? Back off!"
00:34:08.588,00:34:09.505,Thank you.
00:34:24.687,00:34:29.776,"-So, you pay for her medication? -I did."
00:34:31.903,00:34:34.197,-What's changed? -That was my last $300.
00:34:36.032,00:34:38.409,I now literally have no money. None.
00:34:39.577,00:34:40.578,I don't understand.
00:34:40.661,00:34:44.165,You've lost your job. You've got that nut Dorian chasing you around.
00:34:44.248,00:34:45.958,Why give her all of your money?
00:34:46.042,00:34:48.044,-Surely-- -A disease runs in my family.
00:34:48.127,00:34:49.587,It has for five generations.
00:34:49.670,00:34:51.005,"-Pararibulitis? -Yeah, right."
00:34:51.089,00:34:54.175,How did you pay for treatment? You don't seem-- Our parents.
00:34:55.301,00:34:57.762,I was in college. They had more money back then.
00:34:58.679,00:35:02.642,"By the time I'd recovered, my treatments had pretty much depleted all their savings."
00:35:03.267,00:35:06.229,-It's good of you to help. -She's my sister.
00:35:07.855,00:35:10.775,"Every time I see her, she looks at me and thinks..."
00:35:13.236,00:35:15.154,"She thinks maybe she can get better, too."
00:35:16.781,00:35:19.700,"Well, isn't there a chance she will, though? If you did?"
00:35:20.660,00:35:24.080,Let's-- Can we just be quiet for the drive?
00:35:49.313,00:35:51.566,Probably should've seen this one coming.
00:35:52.692,00:35:55.528,Like the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.
00:36:00.616,00:36:02.034,How could I have known?
00:36:02.118,00:36:04.579,There's no way I could have known-- What?
00:36:07.206,00:36:16.340,"I'm not-- I'm coming to get you, Lydia. I am coming to get you, okay?"
00:36:16.424,00:36:18.718,I'm coming to get you!
00:36:22.722,00:36:24.473,"What? Why? No, just leave me alone."
00:36:24.557,00:36:26.100,-I live here now. -What?
00:36:26.642,00:36:28.853,"Well, why do you think I was talking to Dorian?"
00:36:28.936,00:36:30.354,Did you not hear my voice?
00:36:30.438,00:36:33.900,I'm not from here. I'm from a totally different place.
00:36:35.484,00:36:36.319,England.
00:36:37.612,00:36:38.613,Screw this.
00:36:42.825,00:36:45.411,"-Shit, sorry. -Ow! Aha!"
00:36:48.164,00:36:50.541,Hey. That's mine.
00:36:50.625,00:36:51.959,What do you want now?
00:36:52.043,00:36:54.629,I need you to work with me. I want to discuss the case.
00:36:54.712,00:36:56.756,-What case? -The death of Patrick Spring.
00:36:56.839,00:36:58.674,The incident at the Perriman Grand?
00:36:58.758,00:37:02.136,I was hired to investigate it by the victim.
00:37:02.220,00:37:05.640,"Patrick Spring, the rich guy? Wait, he's the one who died at the hotel?"
00:37:05.723,00:37:13.272,"That's right, and he hired me, well above my normal rate, to investigate his own death a full six weeks before it even happened."
00:37:13.731,00:37:17.860,"I wouldn't have taken the case except, come on, animal attack?"
00:37:17.944,00:37:20.404,Seattle? A guy predicting his own death?
00:37:20.488,00:37:23.908,-Pretty interesting stuff. -And how am I involved in any of this?
00:37:23.991,00:37:27.995,You were there the day it happened. They used your key.
00:37:28.579,00:37:30.498,The cases are connected.
00:37:31.999,00:37:33.876,All cases are connected.
00:37:33.960,00:37:36.087,Have you ever actually solved a case?
00:37:36.170,00:37:39.757,"Sure. Tons. Well, some. Well, a few."
00:37:39.840,00:37:42.802,"A bit about a sofa, a thing with Thor-- Thor?"
00:37:45.096,00:37:47.306,"-It's a funny story-- -Listen, you seem like a nice guy."
00:37:47.390,00:37:49.850,"Or not nice, but you seem like a guy, okay?"
00:37:49.934,00:37:52.061,"You seem like a guy, but I can't do this."
00:37:52.144,00:37:56.274,"I'm a murder suspect, okay? I'm broke, and-- Don't be silly. Money won't be a problem for you soon."
00:37:56.357,00:37:57.692,How do you figure that?
00:37:58.276,00:38:00.695,"Now that I've told you you're working the case, you're working the case."
00:38:01.404,00:38:04.824,The universe will make you a part of this whether you are complicit or not.
00:38:04.907,00:38:07.868,You are now a vital part of the investigation.
00:38:08.703,00:38:12.081,"-Well, so, who's gonna pay me. You? -Probably not."
00:38:12.164,00:38:19.630,"But you will investigate, even if you don't mean to, and you will be compensated, even if you haven't technically earned it."
00:38:24.343,00:38:26.470,Stay frosty.
00:38:33.519,00:38:34.979,Project Incubus.
00:38:37.315,00:38:38.149,Shit.
00:38:41.027,00:38:42.236,Whoo!
00:38:46.866,00:38:48.117,Stupid traitor bed.
00:38:49.243,00:38:54.498,"I'm sick of the games! No chess, no checkers, no Monopoly!"
00:38:56.959,00:38:58.919,What is this? What is happening?
00:38:59.003,00:39:01.088,-The Rowdy 3. -Let's go!
00:39:01.172,00:39:04.008,-There are four of them. -I'm wildly aware.
00:39:06.052,00:39:08.804,"They're after you, right? Come on, Dirk, please go."
00:39:08.888,00:39:09.889,"-No. -Please, just go."
00:39:14.185,00:39:16.270,Bad news delivery!
00:39:16.354,00:39:18.105,Hello.
00:39:20.024,00:39:23.819,What the hell is this new shit? Big D is gonna take care of business.
00:39:23.903,00:39:27.615,I'm a person of varied intuitions. I have a lot of feelings about a lot of things.
00:39:27.698,00:39:30.034,"They're rarely wrong, but rarely completely right."
00:39:30.117,00:39:33.996,That's a reality we're going to accept. Accepted? No? Yes? Doesn't matter.
00:39:34.080,00:39:38.000,There's four men with baseball bats headed up the stairs right now to wreck your apartment.
00:39:38.793,00:39:40.628,"-No, no, no. -No, Todd, no!"
00:39:40.711,00:39:42.963,-Please-- -I don't wanna be a part of this.
00:39:43.047,00:39:55.518,Just go before they-- Ding-dong.
00:40:01.482,00:40:05.653,-We are not professionals! -Shut your hole!
00:40:05.736,00:40:09.156,Before we tear it out your face and throw it in a dumpster.
00:40:16.705,00:40:17.832,Help!
00:40:23.921,00:40:32.304,"-TV out! -There's garbage everywhere. What the-- Jesus, you gotta be kidding me."
00:40:32.388,00:40:37.226,"We got eyes on a gun, require backup at 515-- -Request backup. -Request backup at 515 Ridgely Lane."
00:40:37.309,00:40:38.686,Dorian's gonna kick your ass!
00:40:38.769,00:40:42.690,"Shit, Alpha's in danger. We're live. Lock and load."
00:40:42.773,00:40:44.817,Okay. Lockers.
00:41:38.329,00:41:39.371,No.
00:41:44.835,00:41:46.045,Everything I own.
00:41:48.422,00:41:49.381,No.
00:41:50.674,00:41:52.009,Why?
00:41:55.012,00:41:58.182,-What did they do to you? -It's complicated.
00:41:58.891,00:42:00.809,"Where's my rent, Todd?!"
00:42:05.272,00:42:06.690,What did you guys do to this place?
00:42:08.025,00:42:10.528,Who were those guys?! You think they intimidate me?!
00:42:10.611,00:42:12.613,"-Dorian, just listen-- -No, too late."
00:42:12.696,00:42:15.449,Nobody makes a fool out of me. You think I'm stupid?!
00:42:15.533,00:42:17.159,Tell me you have a way out of this.
00:42:17.243,00:42:22.957,"I'm very good at getting into situations. I have more trouble getting out of them-- Dirk, shut up! Just shut up!"
00:42:25.334,00:42:27.545,I know what you did. I warned you.
00:42:27.628,00:42:38.597,"Bye-bye, you thieving mother-- Shots fired. Shots fired. Let's go!"
00:42:38.681,00:42:39.848,Move out.
00:42:46.188,00:42:48.148,-Freeze. Freeze! -FBI. Freeze!
00:42:50.025,00:42:51.819,"-Drop the gun. -No, you drop the gun."
00:42:51.902,00:42:54.780,Drop it. Drop it. Drop your weapons.
00:42:54.863,00:42:55.864,-Drop it. -Freeze.
00:42:55.948,00:42:57.658,What is going on?!
00:43:51.128,00:43:54.715,Find me! Find me!
00:44:15.486,00:44:16.612,What now?
00:44:24.745,00:44:27.456,You're free to go. For now.
00:44:27.539,00:44:28.415,Really?
00:44:28.499,00:44:31.669,Scene techs are saying the death looks like an accident.
00:44:31.752,00:44:32.586,For now.
00:44:32.670,00:44:36.006,Good news is FBI had surveillance on Dorian Ozman's house.
00:44:37.341,00:44:40.177,They did? Uh... why?
00:44:40.844,00:44:44.598,He sold a really incredible amount of drugs to an astonishing number of people.
00:44:44.682,00:44:48.394,"So, I'm not a suspect in anything?"
00:44:49.144,00:44:55.484,"You're a person of interest, permanently, even though you're not necessarily an interesting person."
00:44:56.485,00:44:58.779,That feels unnecessarily rude.
00:44:58.862,00:45:06.578,The police will determine the proper levels of antagonism toward a man now connected to four dead bodies...
00:45:07.621,00:45:10.457,in two separate cases.
00:45:10.541,00:45:12.543,The do not leave town order is still in effect.
00:45:12.626,00:45:14.044,Do not leave town.
00:45:26.765,00:45:29.351,"Hey, you're not supposed to be down here."
00:45:35.190,00:45:36.859,Hermano Palacios?
00:45:36.942,00:45:38.026,Um...
00:45:38.944,00:45:41.447,-Yes? -Did you find a kitten?
00:45:42.698,00:45:46.410,"-What? -In the penthouse, did you find a kitten?"
00:45:46.493,00:45:49.079,"Kitten? Look, I don't know what you're talking about."
00:45:55.043,00:45:56.295,"All done down here, Ed."
00:45:58.255,00:46:00.757,You're sure you did not see a kitten?
00:46:34.666,00:46:35.751,Crap.
00:46:42.508,00:46:45.010,"Must've been the CIA, always getting me out of things."
00:46:45.093,00:46:47.513,"They didn't even mention the bloody Rowdy 3, but I..."
00:46:47.596,00:46:51.683,"I guess the CIA must've told them not to, -which makes sense-- -Shut up. I don't care."
00:46:51.767,00:46:53.644,-Go away. -Need a ride?
00:46:56.480,00:46:59.316,Someone died tonight. They died right in front of us.
00:46:59.399,00:47:00.776,That doesn't bother you?
00:47:00.859,00:47:06.073,"I think it might bother me more later, when I'm less... something."
00:47:06.156,00:47:07.741,Know why Dorian wanted the rent?
00:47:07.824,00:47:10.661,"-Because he was crazy. -No, because I stole it from him."
00:47:10.744,00:47:11.578,"Uh, what?"
00:47:11.662,00:47:18.085,"I was afraid because I knew Amanda needed her meds, and I didn't think I'd get an advance at the hotel, so I paid him in cash."
00:47:18.168,00:47:20.963,I snuck around his house when he wasn't there and stole it.
00:47:21.547,00:47:23.674,I thought he'd be too cracked out to notice.
00:47:23.757,00:47:27.010,"He did notice, and he wouldn't let it go, and now he's dead."
00:47:27.594,00:47:31.890,"Well, to be honest, that seems practical to me."
00:47:31.974,00:47:34.851,Practical? He shot himself in the head.
00:47:39.314,00:47:43.944,I don't have my apartment. I have zero money. I have no prospects.
00:47:44.862,00:47:48.866,"I'm homeless and living a lie, and I'm a suspect in multiple homicides."
00:47:48.949,00:47:52.452,"When you put it like that, it's bad, but we've got a case to solve."
00:47:52.536,00:47:59.167,"A missing girl, her murdered father, and undoubtedly, -more pieces falling into place-- -I am not your Watson, asshole."
00:47:59.251,00:48:04.006,I'm not available for sidekicking on something I am not involved with.
00:48:04.089,00:48:07.301,"I am my own messed-up person, with my own messed-up problems."
00:48:07.384,00:48:09.595,"-So, just-- No, shut up. -Just stop. Stop."
00:48:09.678,00:48:11.179,-You never shut up. -Stop. Stop.
00:48:11.263,00:48:12.389,-Shut up! -Stop!
00:48:14.600,00:48:19.396,"You've been making choices out of desperation for too long, that much is obvious."
00:48:20.272,00:48:24.735,You're backing yourself into a corner. Break the pattern.
00:48:24.818,00:48:27.237,"Take control of your life, Todd."
00:48:27.863,00:48:32.034,"The instant you take control, interesting things will happen."
00:48:34.286,00:48:35.621,I guarantee it.
00:48:40.375,00:48:41.460,No.
00:48:41.543,00:48:45.797,You know what? No. I don't want to hear all that from you right now.
00:48:46.423,00:48:47.549,Keep the Hallmark card.
00:49:19.790,00:49:22.125,Stop the bus. Stop the bus!
00:49:24.002,00:49:25.087,Stop the bus!
00:49:53.365,00:49:57.077,"Your dog, I brought-- The address was on the tag."
00:50:09.673,00:50:11.508,Yeah. Thanks. Okay.
00:51:27.876,00:51:31.254,"That's right, every moment is an opportunity."
00:51:31.338,00:51:34.216,Every second is a chance to change your life.
00:51:48.563,00:51:50.774,Every choice is a new beginning.
00:51:51.274,00:51:56.029,The smallest decisions in life can have the biggest consequences.
00:51:56.988,00:52:01.159,It's never too late. This is your chance to fix everything.
00:52:09.876,00:52:14.673,"Now, announcing tonight's $10,000 midnight pick."
00:52:15.507,00:52:17.008,The winning numbers are...
00:52:18.426,00:52:22.556,"seven, four..."
00:52:24.558,00:52:25.600,five...
00:52:27.769,00:52:31.648,"fifteen, zero..."
00:52:37.279,00:52:38.530,one.
00:00:17.726,00:00:20.478,"Farah, I need help, please."
00:00:20.562,00:00:21.855,Where are you?
00:00:21.938,00:00:23.982,I'm at the Ridgely Building in Springsborough.
00:00:24.774,00:00:28.403,-What are you doing there? -I'm sorry. I snuck out.
00:00:28.486,00:00:29.821,I'm in trouble. Please hurry.
00:00:29.904,00:00:32.073,"Okay, I'm on my way."
00:00:32.157,00:00:35.035,"Lydia, what kind of trouble are you in?"
00:00:38.121,00:00:40.290,Lydia? Lydia!
00:00:55.180,00:00:56.347,Not good.
00:00:57.932,00:00:59.309,Not good at all.
00:01:24.876,00:01:27.796,Okay. A mouse. I'm a mouse. Stupid mouse.
00:01:27.879,00:01:30.548,I really think someone should open up this door right now.
00:01:30.632,00:01:31.883,Someone should open up.
00:01:36.179,00:01:37.430,Open this door.
00:01:39.599,00:01:42.519,I need you to open this door right now.
00:01:44.646,00:01:47.565,Right now.
00:02:05.166,00:02:07.627,Not today!
00:02:53.047,00:02:53.965,Patrick Spring.
00:02:54.799,00:02:56.342,"Crazy to see it up close, right?"
00:02:57.343,00:02:58.511,So much money and then...
00:03:01.097,00:03:02.223,Where's the head?
00:03:04.601,00:03:07.312,We're keeping it separate. You can see it if you'd like.
00:03:08.438,00:03:10.773,Didn't you say you were from Missing Persons?
00:03:10.857,00:03:12.609,I thought this was a Major Crimes case.
00:03:12.692,00:03:15.778,Lydia Spring is a missing person. That's our case.
00:03:15.862,00:03:18.114,-Her father's death fits in. -Can you prove that?
00:03:19.449,00:03:20.450,Soon.
00:03:20.533,00:03:22.535,-Where are the other two bodies? -Other two?
00:03:22.619,00:03:25.038,"From the scene. The tattooed men, one bitten in half."
00:03:25.121,00:03:28.666,"-Oh, they're gone. -Two human corpses are gone?"
00:03:28.750,00:03:31.544,"Well, they're not here. They haven't stopped existing."
00:03:31.628,00:03:35.673,Okay. Where are they existing currently?
00:03:35.757,00:03:39.135,I think they were transferred out to an FBI lab this morning for testing.
00:03:39.219,00:03:43.306,-Something to do with the weapon. -Yeah. Yeah. We were wondering about that.
00:03:43.389,00:03:46.142,"Yeah, some sort of chomping device, a saw or something?"
00:03:51.940,00:03:52.982,Sphyrna mokarran?
00:03:54.901,00:03:55.902,What the hell is that?
00:03:58.196,00:04:00.490,A hammerhead shark killed Patrick Spring?
00:04:00.573,00:04:01.616,How is that possible?
00:04:01.699,00:04:05.578,It's interesting because hammerhead sharks aren't usually aggressive towards humans.
00:04:05.662,00:04:08.998,"-And they aren't found in hotel rooms. -Right? That, too."
00:04:09.999,00:04:13.294,"It was good of you to contact me, Todd. Excellent work as my assistant."
00:04:16.631,00:04:19.884,I just-- What you said about things being connected...
00:04:19.968,00:04:21.928,It just seemed like the right thing to do.
00:04:22.011,00:04:24.347,You're certain the person you saw was Lydia Spring?
00:04:26.391,00:04:27.892,"Yeah, I am. I'm sure."
00:04:27.976,00:04:35.400,"Then perhaps you'll admit, solely for my edification, that there's another connection, however evanescent, between you, me and the Patrick Spring murder case."
00:04:35.483,00:04:41.489,Surely her disappearance and his murder shortly thereafter-- I just found a dog. I don't think it means anything.
00:04:41.572,00:04:43.908,"-I have to go, okay? -Why are you in such a rush?"
00:04:43.992,00:04:45.535,"You're unemployed, technically."
00:04:50.415,00:04:59.465,"I, uh... found something in the hotel. It's a-- -What am I doing? Why am I doing this? -Is that a lottery ticket?"
00:05:02.510,00:05:06.514,-Yeah. Okay. I found it and-- -Is that blood on it?
00:05:06.597,00:05:09.058,No. Maybe. I don't know.
00:05:09.142,00:05:11.519,-And is it a winner? -Yes.
00:05:12.979,00:05:14.272,It's only for 10 grand.
00:05:14.355,00:05:16.190,I can pay for Amanda's medication.
00:05:16.274,00:05:21.279,"I can fix my apartment, my car. I can try and start to fix things."
00:05:21.362,00:05:23.614,Do you seriously think that's just a coincidence?
00:05:23.698,00:05:28.119,I told you the universe would congratulate you for helping solve the Spring murder.
00:05:28.202,00:05:30.705,Are you taking credit for me finding a lottery ticket?
00:05:30.788,00:05:36.669,"-No, it's just a coincidence. -You said-- Goddamn it."
00:05:50.558,00:05:51.809,He doesn't look so tough.
00:05:53.811,00:05:57.607,-I've got a good feeling about this. -About what?
00:05:57.690,00:06:00.735,"-Shouldn't we call the police? -Quick, give me the lottery ticket."
00:06:02.653,00:06:05.365,Hey. What the-- Hey!
00:06:06.824,00:06:07.658,Hey.
00:06:27.178,00:06:28.262,What happened?
00:06:30.598,00:06:31.849,The car turned off.
00:06:34.060,00:06:35.895,You're not gonna try and fix it?
00:06:39.107,00:06:42.026,"If the car turned off here, this is where the car turned off."
00:06:42.860,00:06:45.196,I'm sure it will start up again when it's meant to.
00:06:48.407,00:06:53.496,"Cars are like that, always turning off and on again, breaking down and then fixing themselves."
00:06:56.290,00:06:57.375,"No, they aren't."
00:07:22.316,00:07:24.360,How come nobody's come looking for you?
00:07:25.945,00:07:28.739,"-What? -I have your phone, remember?"
00:07:29.907,00:07:31.993,Nobody's called. It's been over a day now.
00:07:32.076,00:07:33.494,Someone will call.
00:07:38.249,00:07:39.208,"Oh, yeah? Who?"
00:07:39.792,00:07:40.668,My...
00:07:42.628,00:07:43.463,girlfriend.
00:07:43.546,00:07:44.422,Heh.
00:07:45.298,00:07:47.717,Right. Her. She seems real.
00:07:49.719,00:07:50.678,Who was that?
00:07:51.345,00:07:55.475,Who was that guy with the tats and the shotgun that I killed at the power station?
00:07:55.558,00:07:58.227,-What were you doing there? -Why are you doing this to me?
00:07:58.311,00:07:59.145,Doing this to you?
00:08:06.152,00:08:09.238,Answer the question. Who was the guy I killed at the power station?
00:08:12.909,00:08:15.203,I do power systems.
00:08:15.995,00:08:23.419,"Okay? I'm an electrician, technically, but people, organizations, individuals, they hire me to do stuff."
00:08:24.086,00:08:26.923,"Illegal stuff. Look, they hit me up online."
00:08:27.006,00:08:31.636,They wanted me to build some power converter to leech off a larger network.
00:08:31.719,00:08:33.513,Okay? I'd never seen anything like it.
00:08:34.263,00:08:37.225,"All right, I was halfway through programming that..."
00:08:38.309,00:08:39.936,and you showed up.
00:08:50.571,00:08:52.240,"Thanks for telling me all that, Ken."
00:08:54.367,00:08:57.870,"Way my life works, that's the most anybody's said to me in over five years."
00:08:59.580,00:09:01.707,It's mostly just screaming and begging.
00:09:04.126,00:09:06.087,It's nice to listen to somebody else talk.
00:09:15.555,00:09:17.014,"Ain't nobody coming, chump."
00:09:21.811,00:09:23.938,"At least, nobody who ain't supposed to die."
00:09:28.067,00:09:30.278,You psychopath. You total asshole.
00:09:30.361,00:09:33.906,I can't believe you did this to me. I can't believe you did this to yourself.
00:09:33.990,00:09:37.034,Looks like our suspect's undergone a profound change in attitude.
00:09:38.661,00:09:40.871,Gordon Rimmer. Interesting.
00:09:42.164,00:09:45.543,And look at all this stuff. This guy really likes Lux DuJour.
00:09:46.168,00:09:49.797,-Ever listen to his music? A bit loud. -Where's the clicker?
00:09:50.548,00:09:53.009,"Okay. Lux DuJour sucks, and I'm getting out of here."
00:09:53.092,00:09:54.885,Can't open the garage door. Too loud.
00:09:54.969,00:09:56.929,"Besides, we have to investigate the house."
00:09:57.680,00:10:00.808,Wasn't he-- Didn't Lux DuJour disappear?
00:10:01.475,00:10:04.061,I vaguely recall it being a big story at the time.
00:10:04.145,00:10:07.857,-Maybe he's in there. -I am not investigating anything.
00:10:09.358,00:10:10.693,How will you get your lottery ticket?
00:10:15.448,00:10:17.116,Are you insane?!
00:10:18.117,00:10:19.577,Shh.
00:11:43.285,00:11:46.288,Would you let me finish? Go sit over there.
00:11:49.500,00:11:51.419,God. Hello.
00:11:52.962,00:11:55.005,Hang on. Hang on.
00:12:01.178,00:12:02.596,"Well, we find them, too."
00:12:03.889,00:12:06.892,It's the two guys from the hotel. They're obviously in on it.
00:12:07.435,00:12:09.186,The giraffe and the gorilla.
00:12:09.770,00:12:12.148,"You'd be upset, too, if a giraffe tried to kill you."
00:12:17.820,00:12:18.696,Get back.
00:12:28.080,00:12:30.332,"Yeah. Yeah. Well, where's he?"
00:12:31.959,00:12:32.960,What?
00:12:33.043,00:12:38.507,"I don't care where she is, 'cause that's not my problem."
00:12:38.591,00:12:41.802,"Okay? And then what about Red, way out in the middle of nowhere?"
00:12:41.886,00:12:42.803,What about him?
00:12:42.887,00:12:48.017,"There's probably one of them still out there, and if that's the case, then that's not good for any of us."
00:12:48.100,00:12:49.977,"Uh-huh. Yeah, well, no."
00:12:50.060,00:12:52.730,And we have to go to the Animal Transfer Unit.
00:12:52.813,00:12:55.399,There was a goddamn shootout. There's bodies everywhere.
00:12:55.983,00:12:58.152,-We've gotta clean it up. -Did he say bodies?
00:12:58.611,00:12:59.445,Come on.
00:13:03.282,00:13:06.327,"This is really bad, Todd. I would never have done this alone."
00:13:06.410,00:13:10.539,But you were right. That's Lydia Spring. This is a huge breakthrough.
00:13:10.623,00:13:13.250,"But it's possible we're going to die. God, I am so sorry."
00:13:13.334,00:13:15.961,"Oh, damn, we're really living on the edge here, man."
00:13:16.462,00:13:18.422,I don't care that Rainey is dead.
00:13:18.506,00:13:20.132,Rainey is not the Supreme Soul.
00:13:20.216,00:13:22.259,I am the Supreme Soul. I am running things.
00:13:23.177,00:13:24.011,Yes.
00:13:28.015,00:13:31.310,And I'll tell you another thing. Someone is watching us.
00:13:32.102,00:13:32.978,I can feel it.
00:13:34.021,00:13:37.316,"Yeah, we're gonna do something about it. We're gonna take back control."
00:13:37.399,00:13:40.528,We're gonna take back control and purify the situation.
00:13:40.611,00:13:42.321,-He has a gun. -What?
00:13:55.543,00:13:57.127,She broke the nose.
00:13:58.546,00:13:59.505,"Yes, it is."
00:14:01.507,00:14:02.675,"Hello, friend."
00:14:03.300,00:14:04.843,"We are Ed, Zed and Fred."
00:14:05.427,00:14:06.887,These are not our real names.
00:14:06.971,00:14:09.723,What a relief. Those names are so stupid.
00:14:09.807,00:14:13.018,-This is one of our machines. -It's a very good machine.
00:14:13.102,00:14:15.479,Your dead friend over there had a bone saw.
00:14:15.563,00:14:17.773,He told me he was going to cut my face off.
00:14:17.856,00:14:19.900,"Yes, Ned liked to do that."
00:14:20.818,00:14:23.070,Some people like to cut other people.
00:14:23.153,00:14:24.822,Where is Lydia Spring?
00:14:25.990,00:14:27.783,Why are you doing this to Patrick?
00:14:27.867,00:14:30.452,We are not doing anything to the man Patrick Spring.
00:14:37.084,00:14:39.587,You-- You killed him?
00:14:41.297,00:14:44.008,"-He is dead. -That is a fact, yes."
00:14:51.724,00:14:54.894,It's the opposite condition of the one you would like him to be in.
00:15:00.232,00:15:01.525,Where is the kitten?
00:15:02.151,00:15:05.487,How was Patrick Spring in two places at once?
00:15:06.864,00:15:08.198,Who killed this man?
00:15:11.076,00:15:16.248,"-Zed, will you expose her to the light? -Yeah."
00:15:17.374,00:15:18.250,"Okay, Ed."
00:15:26.133,00:15:28.218,Call the crime scene guys to come clean it up.
00:15:29.678,00:15:33.057,"Oh, and thank you for covering for me the other day."
00:15:33.140,00:15:34.099,"Oh, it's no problem."
00:15:34.183,00:15:37.978,"-I know you're going through some stuff. -I'm figuring it out, step by step."
00:15:38.938,00:15:42.524,"Divorce is hard, Weedle. It is like becoming a whole other person."
00:15:43.108,00:15:45.444,Right. How's it going with Sammy?
00:15:49.281,00:15:50.157,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:15:52.326,00:15:53.577,Look who it is.
00:15:55.079,00:15:57.331,Estevez and Zimmerfield.
00:15:59.249,00:16:01.710,-Hello. -We were relieved you were still in town.
00:16:01.794,00:16:03.837,Worried you'd skipped out onto the next case.
00:16:04.380,00:16:16.475,"The opiate ring Dorian Rothlighter was running still exists with or without him, so as long as your boy Todd Brotzman remains a person of interest in your case, he's a person of interest in ours, right? How about the other guy?"
00:16:16.558,00:16:19.687,-What happened to him? -The other guy? Dirk Gently?
00:16:20.604,00:16:22.314,Word came from on high to let him go.
00:16:23.357,00:16:25.275,-Active state interest. -Like the CIA?
00:16:25.359,00:16:27.528,-Something like that. -Exactly like that.
00:16:27.611,00:16:30.823,Wow. You guys really have your hands full in Missing Persons.
00:16:30.906,00:16:32.992,"Maybe Major Crimes should take a crack at it, give you a break."
00:16:35.536,00:16:38.831,-We're here about the bodies. -Bodies?
00:16:39.790,00:16:41.125,What bodies?
00:16:41.208,00:16:43.460,"Men with tattoos, heavy tattoos all over."
00:16:44.753,00:16:51.385,You didn't-- You didn't transfer the bodies from the Spring case?
00:16:51.468,00:16:53.846,-What would we want with them? -We do not want bodies.
00:16:56.598,00:17:04.106,The FBI didn't-- -We gotta go. -Bye.
00:17:05.566,00:17:07.651,-Idiots. -Idiots.
00:17:08.694,00:17:10.988,-Assholes. -All that matters is the girl.
00:17:11.572,00:17:15.284,"Patrick Spring is dead, but we can still save Lydia, yeah?"
00:17:15.367,00:17:16.577,That's our job.
00:17:20.831,00:17:23.834,"Hey, buddy. Think I figured out your problem."
00:17:29.840,00:17:31.216,It's this carburetor.
00:17:31.300,00:17:34.303,"I think I can fix it up, but it's gonna take a bit of time."
00:17:34.386,00:17:35.929,Okay. Great. Thank you.
00:17:37.890,00:17:45.981,"You don't think there's a chance that you could, you know, call a cab for me or something like that?"
00:17:46.065,00:17:49.318,We're lucky we met. Look at this. This road's empty.
00:17:50.402,00:17:53.947,-Plenty of people die out here. -Right.
00:17:54.573,00:17:57.409,"No. You wouldn't, or won't, die. Nobody's gonna die ever."
00:17:57.493,00:17:59.912,"Some people will die, but that's just nature."
00:18:00.579,00:18:04.333,It's all just nature. Isn't it great that we're out here in nature together?
00:18:05.417,00:18:06.752,Thank you. Thank you.
00:18:07.961,00:18:10.089,-You guys on drugs? -No.
00:18:10.798,00:18:12.299,A cab? Really?
00:18:12.841,00:18:15.177,Why didn't you ask him to fly you in a private jet?
00:18:19.723,00:18:21.308,-You want some raisins? -No.
00:18:23.769,00:18:27.481,Yes. I haven't eaten for over 24 hours.
00:18:36.698,00:18:37.866,I don't know what it was.
00:18:39.201,00:18:41.787,"-A few others like me, though. -Others like you?"
00:18:42.454,00:18:44.915,-Assassins? -I don't know. I never got to meet them.
00:18:46.792,00:18:48.043,"I heard about them, though."
00:18:49.002,00:18:50.796,I think about them sometimes.
00:18:53.173,00:18:56.093,Lot more people talking to me back then.
00:18:56.176,00:18:59.179,"So, who is Dirk Gently?"
00:19:02.307,00:19:03.767,Came to me in a dream I had.
00:19:04.351,00:19:06.311,The world will take me where I need to go.
00:19:08.564,00:19:11.567,I'm like a leaf in the stream of creation.
00:19:13.235,00:19:16.864,"Until I find Dirk Gently, whoever and whatever that is, and then I'm a piranha."
00:19:18.574,00:19:20.159,In the stream of creation.
00:19:21.660,00:19:23.620,"Speaking of, I should really kill this guy."
00:19:23.704,00:19:25.205,"No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait."
00:19:25.289,00:19:27.124,"-Wait, wait. -What?"
00:19:27.207,00:19:28.083,Sorry.
00:19:28.625,00:19:31.003,-We can't murder him. -Why not?
00:19:32.629,00:19:33.672,He's helping us.
00:19:38.552,00:19:39.720,Okay. If you say so.
00:19:41.597,00:19:46.393,"There must be a way to get Lydia out of here, and then we can-- Will you shut up for a minute, please?"
00:20:11.835,00:20:15.505,"This is all my fault. Look, I have to tell you, okay?"
00:20:15.589,00:20:18.300,"I'm sorry about what I did before, with the lottery ticket."
00:20:18.383,00:20:21.553,"I think it was, in sight of hind, fairly messed up."
00:20:26.516,00:20:29.019,"Yeah, no, it's gonna be a beautiful thing. You'll see."
00:20:35.901,00:20:38.779,"No, it's gonna be beautiful. This is a speed bump."
00:20:38.862,00:20:41.073,"Oh, it's a big speed bump. Yeah, thanks, Tips."
00:20:41.156,00:20:44.952,"I know that, but you know what else? Technically, we're winning! Uh-huh."
00:20:46.495,00:20:48.956,"Well, we kill them, of course. It's what we do."
00:20:49.498,00:20:53.252,"Both, yes, both. Why one? That doesn't make sense."
00:21:06.682,00:21:07.557,Go away.
00:21:12.104,00:21:14.189,What the hell was that? Hang on.
00:21:14.273,00:21:16.817,You didn't silence your phone?
00:21:28.787,00:21:31.248,-You! -Me. It is.
00:21:31.331,00:21:32.249,"Wait, do I know you?"
00:21:33.583,00:21:34.751,Shit.
00:21:56.732,00:21:58.650,"Hey, Todd, it's me."
00:21:59.484,00:22:02.946,"I know that this might sound crazy, but..."
00:22:04.114,00:22:15.709,"your friend or your boss or your acquaintance or the detective guy, he didn't mention having any guys, like, following you or anything like that, did he?"
00:22:17.294,00:22:19.546,'Cause there's this...
00:22:42.611,00:22:45.155,What?! What? What do you want?
00:23:44.339,00:23:45.507,Okay.
00:23:52.722,00:23:54.975,-Yes? Can I help you? -That's not him.
00:23:55.058,00:23:57.102,-Where's the other guy? -Other guy?
00:23:57.185,00:23:59.563,The other guy. The other guy. Where's the other guy?
00:23:59.646,00:24:03.900,Sorry. I'm the only coroner on duty today. What department did you say you were from?
00:24:03.984,00:24:06.361,Missing Persons. We had an appointment this morning.
00:24:09.197,00:24:11.575,-He wasn't here yet. -That's what he's about to say.
00:24:11.658,00:24:12.951,I wasn't here yet.
00:24:14.244,00:24:16.246,Someone is screwing with us.
00:24:17.581,00:24:19.875,Dirk Gently. Todd Brotzman.
00:24:19.958,00:24:21.084,"Smoke and mirrors, man."
00:24:21.793,00:24:25.172,"I mean, something's for real actually going down."
00:24:29.801,00:24:31.136,We are on our way now.
00:24:36.558,00:24:37.601,Right.
00:24:40.478,00:24:43.565,"Now, we follow up on this, that doesn't make us their bitch, right?"
00:24:43.648,00:24:44.524,I don't think so.
00:24:50.322,00:24:52.282,-We could just call them. -And say what?
00:24:54.784,00:24:56.494,"-Yeah, we're not their bitch. -Right?"
00:24:58.747,00:24:59.831,Let's roll.
00:25:20.560,00:25:22.896,-Got the dog. -What? Why?
00:25:23.480,00:25:24.814,The dog is important.
00:25:24.898,00:25:27.192,"Lots of animals in this case, it seems."
00:25:27.275,00:25:30.403,"-The dog, the shark, the kitten. -What kitten?"
00:25:30.487,00:25:32.405,"Wait, no. Screw that. Never mind."
00:25:32.489,00:25:35.617,-How did you even hear about the shark? -What are you talking about?
00:25:35.700,00:25:40.455,"Hours ago, before we were trapped in that guy's house, you said Patrick Spring was killed by a shark."
00:25:40.538,00:25:43.375,-You've got a great memory. -How do you know about the shark?
00:25:43.458,00:25:45.460,-The hotel room? -I didn't know about that.
00:25:45.543,00:25:48.546,Never mind. Never mind. I did my duty.
00:25:48.630,00:25:51.424,-I helped you steal a dog. -Ish.
00:25:51.508,00:25:52.968,You did your duty-ish.
00:25:53.051,00:25:55.720,"You didn't even do a full half of a duty, you lazy man."
00:25:55.804,00:25:57.973,You tricked me into breaking into a house.
00:25:58.056,00:26:00.058,-Could've waited outside. -Someone shot at us!
00:26:00.141,00:26:01.518,"Hey, he only shot at me."
00:26:01.601,00:26:06.022,"And the house was even more mysterious, and we learned about that rock star Lux DuJour."
00:26:06.106,00:26:08.608,-When did we learn about that? -And this Gordon Rimmer.
00:26:08.692,00:26:09.985,It's all very suspicious.
00:26:12.237,00:26:18.201,"He called the human Lydia Rapunzel, ergo, vis-à-vis, I forward a theory."
00:26:20.412,00:26:21.997,Are you Lydia Spring?
00:26:25.458,00:26:40.056,"-You are? -I wanna go home, but I know you'll just be there now, so, it's like-- What we're dealing with here appears to be a criminal, or perhaps a group, that specializes in hypnotizing humans into believing they're specific dogs and hypnotizing dogs into believing they're specific humans."
00:26:40.140,00:26:43.810,"I wanna go cash in my lottery ticket, call my sister back-- Todd, focus."
00:26:43.893,00:26:48.356,What could Patrick Spring have done to anger an enclave of uncommonly specific dog hypnotists?
00:26:48.440,00:26:50.191,They're not dog hypnotists!
00:26:51.443,00:26:54.529,"Ah, you're about to forward a theory. Excellent. I'm listening."
00:26:55.113,00:26:56.781,She clearly wanted to be there.
00:26:56.865,00:26:59.075,She wasn't hypnotized. She wasn't tied up.
00:26:59.159,00:27:02.454,"There weren't bars on the windows, and she seemed happy."
00:27:02.537,00:27:06.499,"-Yes, like a happy dog. -Just call the police."
00:27:06.583,00:27:11.880,"At this point, I can't explain why I was there, and I'm already in deep crap with them, so, just call them."
00:27:11.963,00:27:15.383,"Do it. Okay? I'm done. So, you handle it now."
00:27:16.092,00:27:17.552,You're still wearing the shower curtain.
00:27:23.892,00:27:25.602,"Hey, you think I like this?"
00:27:30.273,00:27:32.233,Isn't this your job? You're a detective.
00:27:32.317,00:27:35.362,Because I'm trying to do the right thing. Don't you understand?
00:27:36.237,00:27:43.536,"It's always-- all these horrible things, and I get dragged right up next to them."
00:27:43.620,00:27:47.290,"Couldn't you just-- You could just walk away, take whatever Spring paid you."
00:27:47.374,00:27:52.045,No. It's-- The world will lead me where I need to go.
00:27:52.128,00:28:01.012,"I'm a leaf in the stream of creation, right up until I find whoever or whatever killed Patrick Spring."
00:28:02.305,00:28:05.892,And then it will just... take me somewhere new.
00:28:06.601,00:28:09.604,Then what's with all your crap about taking control of your life?
00:28:09.688,00:28:13.108,Just 'cause you know you're playing a game doesn't mean you don't choose your moves.
00:28:14.401,00:28:19.906,"The cases I end up on... if I don't solve them, no one does."
00:28:22.534,00:28:28.623,"Just-- Oh, dear."
00:28:29.833,00:28:32.961,"We have your friend, and then a picture of a woman."
00:28:33.711,00:28:36.631,"-Who's it from? -The man, I assume. The bad man."
00:28:36.714,00:28:38.883,-How'd he get your number? -I gave him my cards.
00:28:38.967,00:28:41.761,"-You gave him your card? -No, my cards, all of them."
00:28:41.845,00:28:45.348,"Self-defense. I do a lot of things, and then later I'm like, Ooh."
00:28:47.600,00:28:50.395,"You don't happen to know this woman, do you?"
00:28:52.856,00:28:53.773,Open this door.
00:28:59.612,00:29:01.156,Eastgate Bridge. Midnight.
00:29:01.406,00:29:04.951,Ha! See? I told you the dog was important.
00:29:21.885,00:29:23.887,This isn't gonna work. This is a bad idea.
00:29:23.970,00:29:26.890,Nonsense. This is the perfect opportunity to get some answers.
00:29:26.973,00:29:29.476,The man shot at us. What if he just pulls a gun?
00:29:29.601,00:29:33.313,Aha. That's why I brought... this.
00:29:34.898,00:29:36.149,What's that supposed to do?
00:29:36.733,00:29:39.652,You know what they say about bringing a knife to a gunfight.
00:29:39.736,00:29:43.239,"-That it's bad? -Oh, bloody hell, is that what that means?"
00:29:46.117,00:29:47.494,That's him. The man.
00:29:54.667,00:29:58.546,"-What do we do? -Well, I think..."
00:30:10.475,00:30:12.352,-Check this out. -All right.
00:30:13.686,00:30:14.521,What have we got?
00:30:15.355,00:30:18.817,Holy shit. That's the guy. That's Todd Brotzman.
00:30:18.900,00:30:20.693,And Dirk Gently. Full house.
00:30:22.862,00:30:25.782,"We bring them in -as soon as whatever this is, is done. -Got it."
00:30:32.539,00:30:33.748,Is that the woman?
00:30:34.332,00:30:35.667,I don't know her.
00:30:35.750,00:30:37.418,"Right, but that is a woman."
00:30:38.086,00:30:39.629,What are you even talking about?
00:30:45.426,00:30:48.054,"Give me the dog, or I kill her."
00:30:48.137,00:30:51.516,"Give us the her, or we'll throw the dog off the bridge."
00:30:51.599,00:30:52.517,-What? -I'm bluffing.
00:30:52.600,00:30:54.894,"But if he shoots her, throw the dog off the bridge."
00:30:54.978,00:30:57.272,-Why did you attack us? -We didn't.
00:30:57.355,00:30:59.816,-How do you know who we are? -We don't.
00:30:59.899,00:31:01.484,-Where's the kitten? -What kitten?
00:31:01.568,00:31:03.862,-Who's that woman? -You don't know her?
00:31:03.945,00:31:06.114,-Do you? -Why did you burn my house down?
00:31:09.158,00:31:10.451,She's not here.
00:31:11.578,00:31:13.413,-Bring me the dog. -Why do you want it?
00:31:15.290,00:31:17.417,-Why did you kill Patrick Spring? -We didn't.
00:31:20.670,00:31:22.380,What the hell are they talking about?
00:31:24.007,00:31:26.467,These are the stupidest goddamn people alive.
00:31:29.888,00:31:32.557,"I'll kill her, I swear."
00:31:35.226,00:31:49.782,"Todd. Todd. Todd, wait. Maybe-- -She stays with us. -That wasn't the deal."
00:31:49.866,00:31:51.826,-There's no deal. -Shit. He's right.
00:32:00.460,00:32:03.796,"-Whoa. What are you doing? -Let the woman go, or I drop it."
00:32:04.839,00:32:08.509,"-Just let her go now. -You are poking a bear, my friend."
00:32:09.093,00:32:11.846,We will burn the soul out of your body for what you've done.
00:32:11.930,00:32:14.015,What are you talking about? What did we do?
00:32:14.098,00:32:15.350,Don't drop my dog.
00:32:15.433,00:32:17.727,"Let her go now, or I drop it, I swear to God."
00:32:17.810,00:32:19.646,"-Let her go. -No, no, no."
00:32:22.148,00:32:23.066,Help me.
00:32:24.692,00:32:27.028,-No! -Holy shit. This is going down.
00:32:28.780,00:32:29.864,I'm coming.
00:32:33.618,00:32:34.661,Todd! Man!
00:32:44.087,00:32:45.213,Nathan!
00:32:46.798,00:32:47.674,Put that down.
00:32:56.599,00:32:58.142,Rapunzel!
00:33:14.534,00:33:17.412,No! And what the hell happened? Who shot Fred?
00:33:17.495,00:33:19.580,There were two men hiding under the bridge.
00:33:19.664,00:33:22.250,One we released from his body. The other still lives.
00:33:23.668,00:33:26.921,They threw the goddamn dog off the bridge.
00:33:28.172,00:33:30.133,Did you see it come out of the water?
00:33:30.216,00:33:32.802,-No. Very busy. -It's in control.
00:33:32.885,00:33:35.263,Everything's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine.
00:33:38.099,00:33:39.642,Wait a second. There's two guys.
00:33:39.726,00:33:42.145,You said you got two guys. Who were those two guys?
00:33:42.228,00:33:44.063,I don't know. They had these.
00:33:46.524,00:33:47.692,What the hell is that?
00:33:48.943,00:33:50.069,FBI?
00:33:51.279,00:33:53.156,You gotta be goddamn kidding me.
00:33:54.323,00:33:55.825,And this one's still alive?
00:33:57.452,00:33:58.286,He is.
00:34:03.666,00:34:07.086,How would you like to be a secret agent?
00:34:09.005,00:34:12.759,All right. All right. All right. Let's go.
00:34:20.641,00:34:22.310,Sorry it took longer than I thought.
00:34:23.019,00:34:25.146,-You should go. -What?
00:34:25.688,00:34:26.856,Run.
00:34:30.985,00:34:32.779,You realize I'm gonna take the car.
00:34:38.076,00:34:40.244,You must be the tenth couple we've found here.
00:34:41.496,00:34:46.709,"We shoot you in the head, cut you up, sell the car for pieces..."
00:34:48.836,00:34:49.921,"cut that up, too."
00:34:50.004,00:34:51.380,"What? Wait, wait, wait."
00:34:51.464,00:34:53.758,"-Listen, listen, listen. -I'm listening."
00:34:56.594,00:35:01.140,"Look, man, you're the one that's in danger, okay?"
00:35:04.435,00:35:05.603,Can I kill him now?
00:35:07.063,00:35:09.690,-You're embarrassing yourself. -Yes?
00:35:24.747,00:35:25.623,Okay?
00:35:40.012,00:35:41.013,There goes that.
00:35:45.226,00:35:47.311,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Jesus Christ."
00:35:48.104,00:35:51.357,-Did you just dodge a bullet? -No. Bullet dodged me.
00:35:52.233,00:35:54.277,I can't be hurt. Universe won't allow it.
00:35:55.027,00:35:56.988,Only constants are me and gravity.
00:35:57.071,00:35:58.406,I'm special that way.
00:35:59.073,00:36:00.366,You're insane.
00:36:08.166,00:36:09.041,See?
00:36:25.099,00:36:27.560,-Holy. -What do you know?
00:36:35.067,00:36:38.070,-You said you kill whoever you meet. -That's right.
00:36:40.156,00:36:41.282,I'm still here.
00:36:43.034,00:36:44.827,You haven't killed me yet.
00:36:47.121,00:36:47.997,That's true.
00:36:49.123,00:36:51.167,"I guess that must mean you're special, too."
00:37:05.973,00:37:07.308,Would you get in the car?
00:37:19.946,00:37:21.155,"They'll see you now, sir."
00:37:29.330,00:37:31.958,"-Thank you for coming, colonel. -Where's General Kinsey?"
00:37:32.667,00:37:34.252,You don't report to him anymore. You report to me.
00:37:35.711,00:37:36.545,I'm Wilson.
00:37:37.296,00:37:39.840,This oversight committee has been reviewing Project Black Wing.
00:37:40.424,00:37:44.220,Then you know that I've been operating under an extremely limited budget.
00:37:47.890,00:37:53.604,"While you did discover some interesting phenomena, your research was inconclusive and without definable results."
00:37:54.772,00:37:55.773,Mistakes were made.
00:37:56.232,00:38:00.945,And worse is that you failed to keep the subjects contained and recover them from the initial breach.
00:38:01.028,00:38:03.823,Now we have potentially dangerous individuals at large...
00:38:04.407,00:38:05.241,over 30 of them.
00:38:05.324,00:38:08.119,"And currently, we only have budget to surveil one."
00:38:08.202,00:38:09.036,Icarus.
00:38:12.206,00:38:14.166,The one going by the name Dirk Gently.
00:38:14.250,00:38:18.421,"The fact is, ma'am, there's a reason we haven't tried to bring in suspects after 15 years."
00:38:18.504,00:38:20.131,They cannot be contained.
00:38:20.214,00:38:24.218,"I believe that we have an undetermined threat out there, and I don't like it."
00:38:25.678,00:38:26.512,Not one bit.
00:38:28.055,00:38:32.685,You claim that you have unique insight into these subjects?
00:38:34.687,00:38:37.189,"Well, I am giving you one last chance, Colonel."
00:38:37.273,00:38:43.571,"Bring them back in yourself, because right now, they are merely another loose end that needs to be snipped."
00:38:44.280,00:38:47.158,We have many threats to deal with.
00:38:47.241,00:38:54.540,"-Too many. Understand? -Surely you're not proposing-- If you fail again, the former Black Wing subjects will be eliminated, starting with Dirk Gently."
00:38:54.623,00:38:58.961,I think you're overestimating your ability-- All of them. Eliminated.
00:39:29.700,00:39:32.286,"God, how is your place so much nicer than mine?"
00:39:32.370,00:39:35.039,"Oh, pounds to the dollar, I think. Exchange rate. Maths."
00:39:38.709,00:39:41.670,-Hey. Hi. -What happened?
00:39:42.254,00:39:46.133,We got you away from those-- the other guys.
00:39:46.217,00:39:51.472,So just lay here and I'll get you a glass of water?
00:39:55.768,00:39:57.144,Thank you for helping me.
00:39:57.228,00:39:59.438,I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't been there.
00:39:59.522,00:40:00.856,"Well, I was there."
00:40:02.024,00:40:04.777,"You're really brave, sort of. Like crazy brave."
00:40:04.860,00:40:07.321,"Or maybe just stupid, but wow."
00:40:07.405,00:40:10.699,And also surprisingly incapable. How have you survived this long?
00:40:10.783,00:40:12.201,"Well, that's why I needed you."
00:40:13.369,00:40:17.248,"God, how crazy was that? Those guys are total nutjobs."
00:40:17.331,00:40:19.291,You think they killed Patrick Spring?
00:40:19.375,00:40:21.710,"-I'm not sure yet. -It's gotta be connected, right?"
00:40:21.794,00:40:23.504,Maybe they're part of the same group.
00:40:24.130,00:40:29.677,"The guys at the hotel, the corpses, the ones who weren't Spring, they had the same tattoos we saw tonight."
00:40:29.760,00:40:31.053,It is connected.
00:40:32.179,00:40:34.807,"Dirk, I saw something."
00:40:35.516,00:40:38.519,Crazier than the dog. Something else. I don't know how to describe it.
00:40:40.896,00:40:41.981,Whose cat is that?
00:40:42.064,00:40:44.733,It's the one from the crime scene everyone's looking for.
00:40:46.152,00:40:47.987,What? Hold on.
00:40:48.070,00:40:50.197,"-Dirk? -Hi, Farah."
00:40:52.491,00:40:56.954,"-You know her? -Well, I-- When they said they have your friend, they meant your friend?"
00:40:57.037,00:00:38.329,"-More of an acquaintance, really. -Mother-- I like the new jumpsuits, very fascist."
00:00:38.955,00:00:39.789,I dig that.
00:00:44.043,00:00:45.295,"What happened here, Rainey?"
00:00:46.045,00:00:47.464,Looks like a homicide.
00:00:47.881,00:00:50.383,"You call me by the name of my first shell, Pollux."
00:00:53.344,00:00:55.180,Is that meant to give you power over me?
00:00:55.263,00:00:59.100,I was given an order to come down to this shithole at 2 a.m.
00:00:59.184,00:01:01.019,I'm one of the original souls.
00:01:01.603,00:01:06.316,And you do not tell me what to do like I'm some kind of drone we found on the street.
00:01:06.399,00:01:07.817,Are we not all equals?
00:01:09.277,00:01:10.153,Simply energy?
00:01:10.236,00:01:14.324,"That's big words from a guy who calls himself the Supreme Soul, hmm?"
00:01:14.991,00:01:18.787,"At least as Lux DuJour, I try to do something."
00:01:20.038,00:01:21.581,I try to create something.
00:01:22.248,00:01:25.752,"How many bodies have you been in in the last ten years, huh, Rainey? Fifty?"
00:01:26.419,00:01:27.462,Hmm?
00:01:28.004,00:01:29.172,What am I doing here?
00:01:29.798,00:01:30.924,What was this all about?
00:01:31.007,00:01:33.760,-Who are these people? -Your energy is being redesignated.
00:01:34.969,00:01:37.555,We found a new location for our temple.
00:01:38.264,00:01:41.059,This body is the key.
00:01:41.684,00:01:45.438,"Say hello to your new vessel, Gordon Rimmer."
00:01:48.066,00:01:49.275,Redesignated?
00:01:50.068,00:01:50.902,You can't do that.
00:01:50.985,00:01:52.445,It's what's best for our cause.
00:01:52.529,00:01:54.823,Cause. Right.
00:01:56.074,00:01:57.450,"You know, it's been decades."
00:01:57.534,00:02:02.872,"If you really cared about our great cause, you would've found Edgar Spring's other machine years ago."
00:02:03.873,00:02:06.209,"You've become addicted to this body, to this life."
00:02:06.292,00:02:08.503,You can't do this to me.
00:02:08.586,00:02:12.799,You can't swap me out against my will into some fat piece of shit!
00:02:13.550,00:02:14.467,I'm a rock star!
00:02:19.514,00:02:21.099,"Supreme Soul, please."
00:02:21.182,00:02:23.768,I'm making a new album. You can't do this to me!
00:02:24.310,00:02:25.228,I'm a rock star!
00:02:26.104,00:02:27.063,I'm a rock star!
00:02:27.772,00:02:28.731,I'm a rock star.
00:02:29.566,00:02:31.234,I'm a rock star!
00:02:36.447,00:02:37.282,I have mace.
00:02:39.534,00:02:40.368,Holy shit.
00:02:41.619,00:02:44.998,-You're Lydia Spring. -Are you the one that wrote this letter?
00:02:46.374,00:02:48.877,-I am. -Do you really have answers?
00:02:50.253,00:02:51.296,I do.
00:02:53.256,00:02:56.259,Who is Zachariah Webb and what was his connection to my family?
00:02:57.010,00:02:58.720,What happened to my grandfather?
00:02:59.637,00:03:00.805,Who killed my mother?
00:03:03.516,00:03:07.979,"Zachariah Webb, I don't know, but I do know... what happened to your mother."
00:03:09.063,00:03:11.900,And I do know why your father's so afraid.
00:03:15.153,00:03:16.279,Unbelievable.
00:03:17.780,00:03:20.241,Why don't you come inside? It's cold.
00:03:28.666,00:03:30.835,Do you like Lux DuJour?
00:03:32.253,00:03:33.504,Who the hell is Lux DuJour?
00:04:12.335,00:04:13.503,Take me to the house.
00:04:35.149,00:04:37.527,Why are you hiding behind that bush?
00:04:40.571,00:04:42.573,"Yeah, but they don't know that."
00:04:48.913,00:04:50.248,My clothes look good on you.
00:04:52.500,00:04:53.334,Okay.
00:04:55.420,00:04:56.421,Thanks.
00:04:58.172,00:04:59.340,"Listen, um."
00:05:01.259,00:05:02.635,I haven't had the chance to...
00:05:03.177,00:05:06.556,"You know, at the bridge, with the dog?"
00:05:07.098,00:05:10.768,You-- That was brave of you.
00:05:17.608,00:05:18.484,Cool.
00:05:19.736,00:05:21.571,Why did you burn down this house again?
00:05:23.323,00:05:28.202,"Well, um-- You said the guys who kidnapped me thought you killed Patrick Spring?"
00:05:28.286,00:05:31.039,Correct. Absolutely no one has any idea what's going on.
00:05:31.122,00:05:33.082,I spoke to the police at the scene.
00:05:33.166,00:05:35.084,-What did they say? -Go away.
00:05:37.336,00:05:40.006,You're a detective. You've been gathering information.
00:05:40.089,00:05:41.382,What have you found so far?
00:05:41.466,00:05:44.218,"Well, I gave the bad guys my phone number."
00:05:44.761,00:05:50.183,-You gave them your phone number. -In self-defense-- -Give me your phone now. -Wait. What are you doing?
00:05:50.558,00:05:52.643,"No, no, no. Look, look, that's a bad idea."
00:05:57.857,00:05:58.691,Come on.
00:06:01.277,00:06:02.195,Okay.
00:06:05.198,00:06:07.492,-Hello. -Where is Lydia Spring?
00:06:09.202,00:06:10.828,Do you have the other machine?
00:06:10.912,00:06:12.246,What other machine?
00:06:12.330,00:06:13.623,That's the wrong answer.
00:06:13.706,00:06:16.209,-Where is Lydia? -Lydia is gone.
00:06:16.292,00:06:20.379,"-What do we need to do to get her back? -We're gonna find you, Miss Black."
00:06:20.463,00:06:22.256,You do not want to find me.
00:06:22.340,00:06:29.472,"Your boss had something that we need, and before he died, he was gonna hand it over like a good little idiot, but now it's on you!"
00:06:29.555,00:06:32.391,This is your last chance. Surrender Lydia Spring.
00:06:34.894,00:06:36.229,I'll see you real soon.
00:06:43.736,00:06:46.280,A machine? I don't know anything about a machine.
00:06:47.657,00:06:49.951,Yes? What did they say exactly?
00:06:52.995,00:06:59.085,"-I need to go back to the Spring Estate. -Are you sure-- My things are there. Clothes, guns-- -You look good. -No more guns."
00:06:59.168,00:07:01.712,-We'll go with you. -Okay. Enough. Enough! I'm done.
00:07:01.838,00:07:03.923,"-I check out of this. -Hey, listen, wait."
00:07:04.006,00:07:06.342,-Hold a moment. -What?
00:07:06.884,00:07:10.179,Are you... mad at me?
00:07:10.263,00:07:12.014,Am I mad at you?
00:07:12.849,00:07:17.228,Yes-- No-- I don't know. I don't know what I am at you.
00:07:17.854,00:07:18.688,Good.
00:07:20.314,00:07:33.744,"-See you soon, Todd. -But-- So... Farah-- Bullet... that hit the man keeping me prisoner."
00:07:34.662,00:07:35.663,It was military.
00:07:36.330,00:07:40.418,"Punched clean through the floor, high terminal velocity, seven-point-six-two."
00:07:41.377,00:07:44.922,I thought you said the landlord shot at you with a pistol.
00:07:45.173,00:07:46.007,But he did.
00:07:46.382,00:07:48.426,"So, then, how's the military involved?"
00:07:58.436,00:08:01.063,"-Colonel Riggins, sir. -Big day, Corporal Friedkin."
00:08:01.147,00:08:04.400,We're prepping for direct contact with a former Black Wing subject.
00:08:04.484,00:08:05.693,"Sir, yes, sir."
00:08:07.778,00:08:08.905,"What is Black Wing, sir?"
00:08:10.156,00:08:12.033,It's what we are. It's-- It's who I am.
00:08:13.618,00:08:16.037,Did you not read the file?
00:08:16.120,00:08:17.205,"Files, sir."
00:08:17.997,00:08:19.207,-Yes. -Yes.
00:08:25.463,00:08:32.011,"In 1988, the Central Intelligence Agency assigned me as operations chief of a division of my own creation."
00:08:32.178,00:08:35.473,This division was given the code name Black Wing.
00:08:36.474,00:08:44.315,"Black Wing had one mission, to seek out, codify and collect individuals with sensory perceptive abilities beyond the normal human scale."
00:08:45.107,00:08:46.192,"So, like fat people?"
00:08:46.984,00:08:49.403,-What? -Fat people who were big on the scale.
00:08:50.696,00:08:52.114,"No, not..."
00:08:53.616,00:08:59.789,Fat people? What-- Files... yes.
00:09:01.499,00:09:03.209,-Seat belt. -Yes.
00:09:27.942,00:09:29.193,-Agh! -Cheer up!
00:09:29.277,00:09:30.361,Jesus.
00:09:31.028,00:09:31.862,Why?
00:09:32.363,00:09:35.908,"Because, you know, we were having fun."
00:09:35.992,00:09:38.160,You were talking to me about stuff.
00:09:38.703,00:09:41.622,"You know, you were asking me questions and stuff, it was good."
00:09:41.789,00:09:44.750,"Yeah, and then you killed that guy."
00:09:45.835,00:09:47.128,"Potato, potato."
00:09:48.754,00:09:52.842,"You're supposed to say it like, Potato, potato."
00:09:52.925,00:09:54.427,What the hell is a potato?
00:10:01.892,00:10:04.020,"Oh, man. Really?"
00:10:04.103,00:10:05.354,Do you know this song?
00:10:06.439,00:10:09.108,-Yes. Of course. -How? Like-- Like you've heard it before?
00:10:09.191,00:10:10.401,Yes.
00:10:10.484,00:10:12.903,Do you know the words of the song he's gonna sing?
00:10:16.574,00:10:17.408,How?
00:10:18.534,00:10:21.537,Do they play the same song on the radio more than once?
00:10:21.621,00:10:22.663,Yes.
00:10:23.623,00:10:26.626,Yeah. How could you possibly not know that?
00:10:26.709,00:10:30.046,I don't-- I don't know who the people on the radio are.
00:10:30.129,00:10:33.257,I never met them. I don't know where they're singing from.
00:10:33.341,00:10:36.510,They're not singing anywhere. It's a recording.
00:10:38.846,00:10:39.930,Oh.
00:10:41.349,00:10:43.684,"-Oh, now you're laughing? -No, I'm not laughing."
00:10:43.768,00:10:45.269,Ha!
00:10:46.103,00:10:48.105,Sing one of the-- Sing it.
00:10:49.106,00:10:49.940,Why?
00:10:50.107,00:10:51.317,To prove you know it.
00:10:51.400,00:10:57.323,"Me, I don't know the words of songs and stuff, but then I turn on the radio and you know the words of the songs he's gonna sing."
00:10:58.532,00:11:00.117,It's kind of unbelievable.
00:11:13.255,00:11:15.007,How do you remember that stuff?
00:11:38.614,00:11:42.701,"Hey, Todd. I'm outside, so, there's that."
00:11:44.412,00:11:47.456,I've been thinking about what Dirk said about me being in the house all the time.
00:11:47.540,00:11:48.499,And he's right.
00:11:48.999,00:11:51.877,"Maybe if I'm, like, out of food, I can go get my own."
00:11:52.878,00:11:55.714,"It's gonna suck either way, so, what am I afraid of?"
00:11:57.174,00:11:59.301,"I'm going to the grocery store, so, you know."
00:12:00.010,00:12:01.053,What an adventure.
00:12:33.043,00:12:35.337,-Is that the dog? -It's the dog from the tape.
00:12:35.421,00:12:38.466,-The dog from the tape. -The dog from the tape from the hotel.
00:12:38.549,00:12:40.342,The dog from the tape from the hotel.
00:12:41.552,00:12:44.638,-Where was it? -Literally outside barking at uniforms.
00:12:44.722,00:12:48.893,The dog from the tape from the hotel... walked into this police station?
00:12:48.976,00:12:51.520,This appears to be the situation. It gets weirder.
00:12:52.062,00:12:55.274,I checked the address on the tag. The place burned down yesterday.
00:12:55.357,00:12:59.487,-Burnt down? Like got burnt down? -That's what they're saying.
00:13:03.782,00:13:05.659,Missing... Persons.
00:13:10.372,00:13:12.917,Our friend Todd... from the hotel.
00:13:18.339,00:13:19.632,That's not a coincidence.
00:13:19.715,00:13:20.758,Not a coincidence.
00:13:20.841,00:13:23.010,-Too many coincidences. -Too many coincidences.
00:13:25.513,00:13:26.347,Hide the dog.
00:13:28.057,00:13:30.935,Fantastic. It's bloody huge.
00:13:31.560,00:13:32.686,Is that a horse barn?
00:13:32.770,00:13:33.979,"Rhino barn, actually."
00:13:34.939,00:13:38.275,"Patrick loved animals. In the '90s, he had a pet rhino named Pepe."
00:13:39.193,00:13:41.487,-Did you know Pepe? -I did.
00:13:42.863,00:13:46.283,My father was Patrick's old chief of security. I spent a lot of time here.
00:13:46.367,00:13:48.118,It's actually a historic landmark.
00:13:48.202,00:13:51.664,It was built in the 1880s for an inventor named Zachariah Webb.
00:13:52.206,00:13:57.545,"But he disappeared so the place fell into disrepair. By the '70s, squatters were living here."
00:13:58.170,00:14:03.592,Patrick bought it back from the government in the mid '90s -just before what happened to his wife. -What happened to his wife?
00:14:04.218,00:14:05.052,She died.
00:14:08.264,00:14:11.767,"-Good to see you, John. -I thought I heard someone drive in."
00:14:11.934,00:14:12.768,Who's this again?
00:14:13.185,00:14:17.982,John Dollow. He's-- Was Patrick's lawyer. You've never met him.
00:14:18.065,00:14:19.775,He seems like someone I've never met.
00:14:21.527,00:14:23.153,"John Dollow, this is Dirk Gently."
00:14:24.822,00:14:28.659,"Well, isn't that, um, interesting?"
00:14:29.201,00:14:30.160,I get that a lot.
00:14:31.245,00:14:33.455,"Well, take a moment, then come and find me."
00:14:33.539,00:14:35.541,I'll be in Mr. Spring's office.
00:14:35.791,00:14:38.085,I-- I have something for you.
00:14:45.050,00:14:46.594,"Yes. Yes, I saw her."
00:14:47.136,00:14:54.602,"She was acting odd, but I saw her and-- I don't know if they killed Patrick, but those weird guys are dangerous."
00:14:55.144,00:14:57.313,These are the men who you traded the dog with for Farah?
00:14:57.396,00:14:59.857,"Yes. Yes, the same guys. They were involved."
00:14:59.940,00:15:07.740,"And I'm not-- I-- I'm realizing I don't actually have the details, but... it's all connected, right?"
00:15:11.201,00:15:13.704,Do you know of a band called The Mexican Funeral?
00:15:14.872,00:15:16.498,Yeah. That was my band.
00:15:16.582,00:15:19.960,They filed a police report saying that their equipment had been stolen.
00:15:21.170,00:15:22.630,Your name is on the report.
00:15:22.713,00:15:24.423,"$4,000 worth of gear."
00:15:24.506,00:15:25.549,Stolen.
00:15:27.009,00:15:28.636,"But it wasn't stolen, was it, Todd?"
00:15:28.886,00:15:33.015,"Okay, look, I didn't-- You sold your band's gear without telling them."
00:15:33.098,00:15:35.017,"Kind of a rotten thing to do, huh?"
00:15:35.100,00:15:36.769,I was going through a rough time.
00:15:36.852,00:15:39.480,We know that. Something to do with a medical condition.
00:15:39.563,00:15:41.440,-You know that? -We know a lot of things.
00:15:41.523,00:15:44.151,"-We called your parents. -Wait, you called my parents?"
00:15:44.234,00:15:46.403,-We're the police. -We investigate shit.
00:15:46.487,00:15:47.988,-That's what we do. -That's what we do.
00:15:48.072,00:15:49.031,You're investigating me?
00:15:49.114,00:15:51.158,"We told you, you're a person of interest."
00:15:51.241,00:15:54.286,Who is getting more and more interesting all the time.
00:15:54.370,00:16:00.751,"Your parents told us you have this medical condition, runs in the family, Your sister now has it, too. Pararibulitis, very rare."
00:16:00.834,00:16:03.003,-We're looking into it. -Real interesting stuff.
00:16:03.087,00:16:06.298,"Okay, okay, what does this have to do with what's happening right now?"
00:16:07.174,00:16:08.842,I-- I came here to try to help.
00:16:08.926,00:16:10.844,Are you accusing me of something?
00:16:11.512,00:16:13.681,Is there something we should be accusing you of?
00:16:13.764,00:16:16.976,"Well, let's see. Well, there's the house, the address you gave us."
00:16:17.059,00:16:20.229,-It burnt down yesterday. -And they're not ruling out arson.
00:16:20.312,00:16:23.190,-You said you were there. -Let me see. What is it?
00:16:23.273,00:16:25.609,-Three? Three. -Three. Three total crime scenes.
00:16:25.693,00:16:28.779,Don't think we don't know about you taking the money back from your landlord.
00:16:28.862,00:16:31.323,-The one who is now dead. -We know about that.
00:16:31.407,00:16:33.033,"Oh, we know about that."
00:17:03.605,00:17:05.816,-I made it. -What?
00:17:07.234,00:17:08.068,I made it.
00:17:09.319,00:17:10.487,Good.
00:17:17.036,00:17:18.662,"No, no, no, no."
00:17:26.170,00:17:31.884,"Mr. Brotzman, you are becoming a very compelling figure."
00:17:32.384,00:17:37.473,"Almost as interesting as your detective buddy, the one with the friends in all the high places."
00:17:53.864,00:17:56.158,"-Amanda? -Todd, I messed up."
00:17:56.241,00:17:58.452,Will you please help me? I messed up.
00:17:58.535,00:17:59.536,-Where are you? -Help!
00:18:00.913,00:18:01.747,Amanda!
00:18:03.874,00:18:08.587,Can I... go? That was my sister. She needs me to pick her up.
00:18:12.007,00:18:12.966,Sure.
00:18:13.050,00:18:14.885,You're here voluntarily. Right?
00:18:15.427,00:18:16.345,Right.
00:18:20.933,00:18:22.267,"Ooh, that kid's guilty."
00:18:22.810,00:18:23.936,"Yeah, but of what?"
00:18:31.443,00:18:32.653,Check out the wack job.
00:18:45.082,00:18:47.459,"No, no, no, no!"
00:18:48.502,00:18:50.337,"-What the hell, man? -What the hell?"
00:18:51.672,00:18:52.840,To the bleachers!
00:19:18.532,00:19:19.658,I'm just doing my job.
00:19:21.785,00:19:23.036,Whoa.
00:19:55.777,00:19:57.070,Help me!
00:20:00.365,00:20:03.160,Help me!
00:20:08.916,00:20:11.627,"-Bart, is that you? -Yeah, probably."
00:20:12.169,00:20:14.171,"Hey, can't you get us down from here?"
00:20:14.880,00:20:16.089,"You know, with your thing?"
00:20:16.173,00:20:17.090,What thing?
00:20:17.424,00:20:21.428,"You know, your... flow of the universe thing."
00:20:22.179,00:20:23.805,I thought you didn't believe in that.
00:20:26.934,00:20:35.567,"You know, it's funny. I knew--- I knew I'd die... in some-- Oh, some weird way eventually."
00:20:35.651,00:20:39.821,"For a pretty scared guy, you sure do hang around with some dangerous types."
00:20:39.905,00:20:41.114,You kidnapped me!
00:20:41.198,00:20:42.157,I meant before that.
00:20:43.242,00:20:44.076,"Yeah, well..."
00:20:47.955,00:20:54.461,"Eventually, I thought I'd get a real job, but... you get a payday from one bad guy, you get a payday from another bad guy."
00:20:54.920,00:20:56.213,"-Hey, Ken. -Yeah."
00:20:56.296,00:21:02.344,"You should know, when they come back, either you're gonna die, or I'm gonna kill all them."
00:21:02.427,00:21:05.305,"Or you're gonna die, and then I'm gonna kill all them."
00:21:05.806,00:21:10.185,"Or I'm gonna kill some of them, and then you get killed, and then I kill the rest."
00:21:10.477,00:21:15.565,"But no matter what happens, I want you to know that was the way it's meant to be."
00:21:16.358,00:21:18.193,"What about you, Bart? You...?"
00:21:19.361,00:21:21.154,-You'll be fine no matter what? -Yeah.
00:21:22.197,00:21:23.323,I don't get hurt.
00:21:28.996,00:21:30.956,"I do think I'm gonna miss you, though."
00:21:35.085,00:21:36.670,Help me!
00:21:36.753,00:21:42.467,I've been going through Mr. Spring's effects and executing his final wishes according to his last will and testament.
00:21:43.218,00:21:45.721,He left this... for you.
00:21:47.389,00:21:56.398,What's interesting is that his instructions were not to give it to you unless you were in the presence of someone named... Dirk Gently.
00:21:57.065,00:21:58.567,"Well, it's lucky I'm here, then."
00:21:58.650,00:22:00.652,I doubt very much it's got to do with luck.
00:22:00.736,00:22:04.531,Patrick Spring rarely left anything of importance to chance.
00:22:15.042,00:22:17.085,When Patrick had me track you down...
00:22:19.171,00:22:20.005,He knew.
00:22:22.132,00:22:23.508,He knew he was going to die.
00:22:25.343,00:22:29.848,"Yeah, I'm beginning to think he didn't hire me to prevent his murder at all."
00:22:31.808,00:22:33.727,I think he hired me to solve it.
00:22:35.395,00:22:36.813,Hmm.
00:22:36.897,00:22:38.940,"Three questions, one answer."
00:22:39.816,00:22:40.650,What does that mean?
00:22:43.320,00:22:46.573,Perhaps we should give the young lady a moment.
00:22:57.125,00:22:58.126,Get it together.
00:22:58.919,00:23:00.837,Get it together.
00:23:00.921,00:23:02.631,-What are you looking at? -What?
00:23:03.131,00:23:06.510,I thought... you were outside.
00:23:06.927,00:23:09.429,Why would I leave the room? All the good stuff is happening in here.
00:23:15.769,00:23:17.312,Were you and Patrick...
00:23:20.190,00:23:21.024,close?
00:23:24.402,00:23:25.946,I've known him my entire life.
00:23:27.989,00:23:32.869,"When... Catherine was killed, my dad never recovered and..."
00:23:33.537,00:23:46.216,"Patrick gave my life a lot of purpose, if that makes any sense, and I don't-- In three days, everything just suddenly went crazy, and I screwed it all up again."
00:23:46.550,00:23:48.760,"Patrick's dead, Lydia's gone, I feel like a..."
00:23:55.058,00:24:00.230,"I am ineffectual and a generalized scramble of disappointment, incompetence."
00:24:04.109,00:24:06.903,-You're only some of those things. -Agh! No.
00:24:25.505,00:24:26.339,Okay.
00:24:27.424,00:24:29.926,-I need to go find Lydia. -No. We can't leave. Not yet.
00:24:31.428,00:24:32.262,Why?
00:24:34.222,00:24:37.767,-Do you know something? -I don't know anything. Ever.
00:24:37.851,00:24:39.227,It's really quite relaxing.
00:24:39.311,00:24:42.355,"But this is what I do, this is how I work."
00:24:42.439,00:24:44.191,I follow fate around.
00:24:44.274,00:24:45.650,It's how we found you.
00:24:46.234,00:24:49.988,"I can't promise anything, but just... give it a chance?"
00:24:51.364,00:24:53.116,"Well, what do you want to do?"
00:24:53.200,00:24:55.035,I would start by opening that envelope.
00:25:02.083,00:25:05.629,You. This doesn't look anything like you. He's got the hair all wrong.
00:25:15.680,00:25:16.765,Um?
00:25:18.516,00:25:19.351,Farah?
00:25:20.393,00:25:24.439,What are you-- No. Where are you-- Oh! It's a map.
00:25:24.522,00:25:26.024,It's a map! I get it!
00:25:41.957,00:25:42.874,Jesus Christ!
00:25:43.250,00:25:44.584,"Oh, thank God you're okay."
00:25:44.668,00:25:46.628,I just went shopping. It's okay. It's okay.
00:25:47.295,00:25:49.005,Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
00:25:49.798,00:25:56.096,"Everything's okay, I just-- I had a little flare-up, but... I made it home in one piece."
00:25:56.179,00:25:57.013,Okay.
00:25:58.265,00:26:00.433,Why are you out of breath? How did you get here?
00:26:00.517,00:26:02.352,I thought that your car was all beat up.
00:26:02.435,00:26:05.146,"I ran, and then I took the bus, and then I ran some more."
00:26:06.439,00:26:08.358,"God, I was so worried."
00:26:13.738,00:26:14.698,Where's Dirk?
00:26:16.908,00:26:17.909,Where's Dirk?
00:26:17.993,00:26:23.665,Yeah. I just-- I have to ask him about some stuff 'cause some stuff happened.
00:26:23.748,00:26:26.209,You have to ask Dirk Gently about some stuff?
00:26:26.293,00:26:29.045,Isn't he the reason that all this weird stuff is happening?
00:26:32.257,00:26:33.758,What weird stuff?
00:26:34.301,00:26:37.721,"-Everything. -Look, he-- He doesn't know anything."
00:26:37.804,00:26:40.473,The amount of stuff that he doesn't know is stupefying.
00:26:40.557,00:26:41.766,It would blow your mind.
00:26:41.850,00:26:44.352,"Okay, but isn't that how he works?"
00:26:44.936,00:26:46.438,"Like, as a detective?"
00:26:48.440,00:26:49.274,Okay.
00:26:50.650,00:26:55.155,-Then why are you his assistant? -I'm not-- There's something that you're not telling me.
00:26:57.240,00:27:01.328,"Is there, like... a lot of stuff that you're not telling me?"
00:27:01.995,00:27:07.917,"No. I-- No, there's just-- Maybe it's a good idea if you came to stay with me."
00:27:08.001,00:27:11.504,"-You want me to leave the house. -You did already today, and it was fine."
00:27:11.588,00:27:12.964,"No, it wasn't fine."
00:27:14.716,00:27:18.845,It was almost... not fine.
00:27:22.682,00:27:24.476,Don't you remember what this was like?
00:27:26.269,00:27:27.604,I-- I-- I'll call a cab.
00:27:27.687,00:27:30.398,I used to take cabs all the time when I still had attacks.
00:27:30.857,00:27:34.361,"Look, you'll stay with me. It'll be great. I promise."
00:27:36.446,00:27:37.989,It's here.
00:27:38.490,00:27:46.664,"Farah, I think if we-- No, it's this way.."
00:27:47.207,00:27:48.249,Farah?
00:27:48.333,00:27:51.169,I've got it. I've got it. I've got an idea. I've got an idea.
00:27:51.961,00:27:53.755,Sorry. Got it wrong. It's down here.
00:27:54.798,00:27:55.965,It's definitely this way.
00:28:03.681,00:28:05.183,That didn't work.
00:28:19.739,00:28:20.615,This is it.
00:28:22.575,00:28:23.868,Um.
00:28:23.993,00:28:26.413,"Okay, you're a bit ahead of me now on this one. What?"
00:28:26.996,00:28:27.914,Laundry?
00:28:29.165,00:28:29.999,Maybe it's...
00:28:30.542,00:28:32.085,Ah-ha. Nope. Not in there.
00:28:32.627,00:28:34.337,What are we looking for? Do you know?
00:28:39.968,00:28:41.052,It's a wall.
00:28:43.054,00:28:45.849,Was there something about this wall that was special to him?
00:28:45.932,00:28:47.976,Did he enjoy walls?
00:28:48.059,00:28:50.437,Did he ever mention a love for walls?
00:28:50.520,00:28:51.855,Because that could be a clue.
00:28:51.938,00:28:56.568,Perhaps the person or people who killed Patrick Spring were rogue wall enthusiasts.
00:28:59.446,00:29:00.905,You hate these walls!
00:29:15.920,00:29:17.213,Give me the map.
00:29:46.201,00:29:50.163,Oh! What is this place?
00:29:50.246,00:29:53.082,This room is built into the foundation of the house.
00:29:53.166,00:29:55.460,It's been here since day one.
00:29:57.754,00:30:00.632,"Patrick Spring didn't build this, Zachariah Webb did."
00:30:01.883,00:30:05.220,What's that big electro-thingie?
00:30:14.687,00:30:18.525,It's some kind of generator. But this doesn't make any sense.
00:30:18.608,00:30:21.236,Patrick didn't know anything about technology.
00:30:23.988,00:30:25.198,Oh.
00:30:28.910,00:30:30.829,How did you do that?
00:30:32.205,00:30:33.706,With my hand.
00:30:38.044,00:30:39.254,What's this?
00:30:44.843,00:30:46.344,Edgar Spring. Who's that?
00:30:46.427,00:30:50.223,Patrick's father. But this is Patrick's handwriting.
00:30:50.807,00:30:54.060,"It started here, it ends here. Please save her."
00:30:58.690,00:31:00.108,What is this thing?
00:31:00.942,00:31:02.652,Very important.
00:31:11.160,00:31:12.036,Save her.
00:31:13.705,00:31:14.581,Save her.
00:31:16.374,00:31:17.876,He must be talking about Lydia.
00:31:18.835,00:31:20.712,He planned this.
00:31:22.422,00:31:23.256,All of it.
00:31:25.174,00:31:31.180,"But... if Patrick knew this was going to happen, then why didn't he save himself?"
00:31:33.099,00:31:33.933,Dirk?
00:31:36.895,00:31:39.564,I'm starting to think you're actually a pretty good detective.
00:31:56.497,00:31:57.582,-Bart? -Yeah.
00:31:57.957,00:31:59.626,-Bart! Bart! -Ken.
00:31:59.959,00:32:01.085,Please do something.
00:32:01.169,00:32:03.671,Do anything. Something. Please.
00:32:03.963,00:32:05.757,It doesn't work like that.
00:32:05.840,00:32:06.674,Like what?
00:32:07.759,00:32:08.801,"Oh, my God."
00:32:22.690,00:32:24.484,These are the ones that killed Jake?
00:32:25.234,00:32:28.655,-They don't look like professional hires. -Is that a new guy?
00:32:28.738,00:32:29.572,Who sent you?
00:32:30.323,00:32:31.699,The Cavatos?
00:32:31.783,00:32:33.534,I don't know who the Cavatos are.
00:32:33.618,00:32:35.411,"Okay, she's crazy? All right?"
00:32:35.495,00:32:37.997,"She killed him. Not me. I mean, I'm-- I'm just here."
00:32:38.081,00:32:41.250,"-She killed him. She's the one, man. -This is just noise."
00:32:41.626,00:32:42.502,I don't care.
00:32:43.461,00:32:44.420,You're gonna burn.
00:32:44.504,00:32:49.050,"Ken, that new guy who just arrived, that's who we were waiting for."
00:32:50.635,00:32:52.845,Listen! Please! Just get me down!
00:32:53.846,00:32:56.975,"I'm not the guy you want. She is, okay?"
00:32:57.058,00:33:02.730,-This will shut him up. -Do some-- No!
00:33:37.306,00:33:38.224,Put some clothes on.
00:33:49.444,00:33:51.988,You knew this was gonna happen.
00:33:53.656,00:33:55.742,"Well, not this, but something like this, sure."
00:33:57.285,00:33:58.578,"It's real, isn't it?"
00:33:59.245,00:34:00.163,It's all real.
00:34:00.747,00:34:03.666,You really are who you say you are.
00:34:03.750,00:34:07.045,Some kind of... killer angel.
00:34:07.128,00:34:08.337,Angel?
00:34:14.177,00:34:15.720,I really am what I say I am.
00:34:16.763,00:34:18.056,I'm with you for a reason.
00:34:19.223,00:34:20.224,"My life, it's..."
00:34:21.142,00:34:22.602,It's happening for a reason.
00:34:24.312,00:34:27.482,"-Maybe, yeah. -We have to find Dirk Gently."
00:34:29.150,00:34:31.110,We need to kill Dirk Gently.
00:34:32.195,00:34:33.362,You drive.
00:34:42.455,00:34:44.457,"See? That wasn't so bad, right?"
00:34:45.333,00:34:46.584,What happened to your lock?
00:34:47.543,00:34:49.670,"Oh, my God. What happened to your apartment?"
00:34:50.254,00:34:54.884,"-Some kind of semi-conductor or something. -Semi-conductor? Like a-- Oh, God."
00:34:55.760,00:34:56.594,"Hey, Dirk."
00:34:57.136,00:34:58.387,"Oh, hi, Amanda."
00:34:58.471,00:35:00.681,"Look, it's Amanda. Amanda's fantastic."
00:35:00.765,00:35:01.724,You're fantastic.
00:35:04.018,00:35:05.228,Is this part of the case?
00:35:05.311,00:35:07.355,"-Yes. But-- -Dirk, why are you here?"
00:35:07.438,00:35:09.315,"-We were waiting for you. -Hey, Todd."
00:35:10.274,00:35:11.234,"Hi, Farah."
00:35:13.361,00:35:14.904,-What is this? -We don't know.
00:35:14.987,00:35:17.365,We think it's some schematic of something.
00:35:17.448,00:35:19.408,"Dirk, this is my apartment."
00:35:19.492,00:35:21.619,"-Oh, is that why you're here? -It's a map."
00:35:22.245,00:35:25.873,-It's another map. A map led us to a map. -It's not a map.
00:35:25.957,00:35:30.419,It's one of those layers on maps you can see on city government websites that show utilities..
00:35:30.503,00:35:33.798,City government web-- -I don't get out that much. -Me neither.
00:35:33.881,00:35:35.842,This is an electrical grid. See?
00:35:36.425,00:35:37.969,And those are power lines.
00:35:38.511,00:35:41.264,"Oh, cool. No, this is really crazy."
00:35:41.347,00:35:43.432,"Oh, my God. She's right."
00:35:43.516,00:35:46.519,"Those are where the roads would be, and that's the Ridgely."
00:35:46.602,00:35:48.479,That's this building.
00:35:50.398,00:35:52.441,-I'm Farah. -I'm Amanda.
00:35:53.359,00:35:54.193,Cool jacket.
00:35:54.735,00:35:55.903,It's all happening.
00:35:56.737,00:35:57.864,"Oh, for God's sakes."
00:36:08.082,00:36:09.876,Oh! Would you stop following me?
00:36:09.959,00:36:13.421,I was just going down to get the magic light bulb from my car.
00:36:13.504,00:36:14.922,Magic light bulb?
00:36:15.256,00:36:17.717,"-Look, what did I tell you? -Will you just get out?"
00:36:17.800,00:36:20.553,"I told you it would bend back around to you, and now it has."
00:36:20.636,00:36:23.055,-Give me a second. -We're meant to know each other.
00:36:23.139,00:36:25.892,"Now, I'm sick of having this conversation."
00:36:26.601,00:36:30.396,There's a map in there with your bloody building right at the center of it.
00:36:34.901,00:36:36.611,I want your help.
00:36:42.408,00:36:43.576,This neighborhood...
00:36:45.494,00:36:47.538,the one we're in right now...
00:36:49.457,00:36:50.708,it's called Springsborough.
00:36:51.959,00:36:54.962,Like-- Like Edgar Spring.
00:36:56.214,00:36:58.257,"That was Patrick Spring's father, right?"
00:36:59.592,00:37:00.551,Springsborough.
00:37:03.721,00:37:06.766,"It's not a coincidence, is it?"
00:37:07.308,00:37:08.142,No.
00:37:09.977,00:37:12.355,I'm certain we'll find that it's not.
00:37:13.940,00:37:15.524,You knew this was going to happen.
00:37:15.608,00:37:20.738,"Not this, but... something like this. Yes."
00:37:20.821,00:37:22.281,"It's real, isn't it?"
00:37:23.282,00:37:24.200,It's all real.
00:37:25.326,00:37:27.870,You really are what you say you are.
00:37:27.954,00:37:30.748,Some kind of holistic detective.
00:37:30.831,00:37:31.666,I'm trying.
00:37:34.085,00:37:35.169,Is this enough proof?
00:37:37.171,00:37:38.673,Will you help me?
00:37:53.229,00:37:54.355,"Hello, Project Icarus."
00:37:57.275,00:37:58.150,No.
00:38:00.736,00:38:01.696,Leave me alone.
00:38:01.946,00:38:04.323,"Svlad, we need to talk."
00:38:04.407,00:38:05.950,That's not my name anymore.
00:38:06.450,00:38:07.451,"Dirk, then."
00:38:07.535,00:38:08.577,I said leave me alone.
00:38:09.412,00:38:10.246,Friedkin!
00:38:10.621,00:38:13.249,"-Friedkin! God damn it, get off of him! -He was escaping!"
00:38:13.332,00:38:15.376,"You release him now, soldier. That's an order!"
00:38:18.838,00:38:21.090,Is this what you do now? You just attack people?
00:38:21.882,00:38:23.551,"I'm sorry, sir. I got confused."
00:38:27.805,00:38:30.099,"-He seems like a winner. -Dirk, listen to me."
00:38:30.182,00:38:33.686,-Why? Do you have new lies to tell me? -We need you to come back in.
00:38:33.769,00:38:36.647,"Yes, why not? It's only been 16 years."
00:38:36.731,00:38:38.566,Black Wing is under review.
00:38:39.233,00:38:42.778,That's why we bailed you out when police brought you in. It's the least you can do.
00:38:42.862,00:38:46.198,-The least I could do? -This is in your best interest.
00:38:46.282,00:38:48.743,"You promised them something, and you couldn't deliver."
00:38:49.994,00:38:53.247,"You promised me something, and you couldn't deliver."
00:38:53.331,00:38:56.459,"Dirk, I am not the enemy here."
00:38:57.877,00:38:59.712,And you're not a detective.
00:38:59.795,00:39:03.299,You're going to get yourself hurt or killed if-- I am on a case.
00:39:04.342,00:39:07.928,"I have friends, and we found clues."
00:39:08.012,00:39:10.514,"We're gonna solve a mystery, a real one."
00:39:11.015,00:39:14.602,And some people think I'm a pretty good detective!
00:39:14.685,00:39:17.897,I'm trying to protect you. I don't know what they'll do.
00:39:17.980,00:39:20.232,I don't care. I don't need you.
00:39:26.113,00:39:27.782,Go back to hiding in the shadows.
00:39:29.867,00:39:31.869,It was the only thing you were ever good at.
00:39:43.923,00:39:45.508,-You want me to go get him? -No.
00:39:45.591,00:39:46.759,Not now.
00:39:47.885,00:39:49.220,We'll try another angle.
00:39:50.554,00:39:52.890,"You'll get them, sir. All of them."
00:39:54.850,00:39:55.851,We have to.
00:40:01.899,00:40:05.069,"I'm just here right now. I'll get it going, and then I'll..."
00:40:06.570,00:40:09.031,Doesn't look like anyone else has been here since we were here.
00:40:13.828,00:40:16.330,"There's a ton of bodies to clean up, but everything still works."
00:40:17.665,00:40:18.749,And bring a mouse.
00:40:26.257,00:40:28.384,Forty-seven for a high on Tuesday.
00:40:28.467,00:40:29.635,And now for the news.
00:40:29.718,00:40:34.640,The surprising update on the body discovered at the scene of the arson in Logan Heights this morning.
00:40:35.057,00:40:40.229,"We now have information that the body has been identified -as that of Robert Wayne Terrio, -Shut up."
00:40:40.312,00:40:47.653,"better known to the public as beloved 1980s rock icon Lux DuJour, who went missing nearly two decades ago."
00:40:47.945,00:40:53.075,How DuJour came to be buried under the garage of a single-bedroom-- Shut up! Shut up!
00:40:53.159,00:40:56.036,"No, no, no!"
00:41:02.710,00:41:04.128,"Oh, no."
00:41:10.342,00:41:12.219,It's not your fault. It's not your fault.
00:41:13.471,00:41:14.930,It's not your fault. I'm sorry.
00:41:17.016,00:41:17.850,Sorry.
00:00:29.112,00:00:29.946,Damn it!
00:00:38.788,00:00:40.498,Stop whining. You were done with that body.
00:00:40.582,00:00:41.958,Put him in the machine!
00:00:44.502,00:00:47.130,"Here, come on, let's go. We're behind the clock here. Go!"
00:00:47.672,00:00:48.590,Go!
00:00:49.424,00:00:51.217,"God, idiots."
00:00:58.641,00:00:59.893,In perpetuum.
00:01:09.736,00:01:11.071,"Yeah, clear here."
00:01:15.033,00:01:16.076,-Brother. -Brother.
00:01:17.368,00:01:18.411,Brothers.
00:01:23.291,00:01:25.293,What about the obsolete soul?
00:01:26.669,00:01:27.504,"Oh, yeah."
00:01:28.296,00:01:29.380,Well. Well...
00:02:00.161,00:02:01.955,Can I eat this? What is it?
00:02:02.664,00:02:04.249,Dirk made that. Don't eat it.
00:02:04.332,00:02:06.835,-Could I ask you a question? -What?
00:02:07.794,00:02:11.631,"Your apartment, it did not used to look like this."
00:02:15.218,00:02:18.972,Yeah. There was a whole... thing.
00:02:19.055,00:02:21.683,"I swear to God, you are the shadiest person in the world."
00:02:24.602,00:02:28.815,Todd! Todd! Come out! Farah says she's solved the mystery!
00:02:28.898,00:02:30.775,I actually didn't say that.
00:02:30.859,00:02:34.070,"Todd, come out! Farah says she didn't solve the mystery!"
00:02:37.866,00:02:40.535,-Are they waiting for you? -He thinks he's waiting for me.
00:02:41.119,00:02:41.995,What about Farah?
00:02:42.078,00:02:44.664,"-What about Farah? -Dude, seriously?"
00:02:44.747,00:02:49.878,"A magic detective and hot chick want you to come hang with them, and you're acting like it's the worst thing ever."
00:02:50.461,00:02:53.464,-I don't wanna drag you into it. -Drag me. I wanna get dragged.
00:02:53.548,00:02:55.341,I'm trying to keep you safe.
00:02:55.842,00:02:57.385,"Okay, Todd! We're leaving!"
00:02:57.969,00:02:58.803,They're leaving.
00:02:59.971,00:03:01.598,-You'll be okay? -You're gonna go?
00:03:02.182,00:03:03.558,-I'll be fine. -I worry.
00:03:03.641,00:03:05.018,I know you do. But...
00:03:06.269,00:03:07.353,I have your number.
00:03:07.437,00:03:10.023,I have Dirk's number. I even have Farah's number.
00:03:10.773,00:03:12.317,I'll be fine. Oh!
00:03:12.942,00:03:15.153,Take your cool guy jacket. You look good in it.
00:03:15.653,00:03:16.487,Why?
00:03:17.989,00:03:18.823,Farah.
00:03:19.324,00:03:20.867,-I see the looks. -The looks?
00:03:20.950,00:03:23.286,"You, her. Not her, you."
00:03:23.995,00:03:27.123,Dirk's got a jacket. She's got a jacket. Jacket team go.
00:03:27.206,00:03:28.917,"I'll stay here, clean this place up."
00:03:29.000,00:03:30.418,"-Really? -No. Hell, no."
00:03:34.088,00:03:35.590,-I love you. -Yeah. I know.
00:03:41.429,00:03:43.264,"Hey, it's me. Wait up."
00:03:45.600,00:03:46.434,Hey.
00:03:47.268,00:03:50.271,I couldn't find my jacket. That's what took so long.
00:03:50.355,00:03:54.317,"I was telling Dirk, 1978, height of the oil crisis, right?"
00:03:54.901,00:03:59.739,"Edgar Spring, Patrick's father, buried his own power grid, three-mile radius, calls it Springsborough."
00:03:59.822,00:04:02.825,There's a grid. It's under our feet. We're walking on it right now.
00:04:02.909,00:04:05.828,They say he had an unlimited energy device.
00:04:05.912,00:04:08.039,-Who? -Edgar Spring. Aren't you listening?
00:04:08.122,00:04:11.167,"He powered this part of the city for 30 years, on his own."
00:04:11.251,00:04:15.296,Power went dark around the time he bought back the Webb mansion from the government.
00:04:15.797,00:04:17.215,What happened to Edgar Spring?
00:04:17.298,00:04:20.718,"No one knows. Some say he died, some say he's still out there somewhere."
00:04:20.802,00:04:23.304,-Why didn't you ask Patrick? -He never talked about it.
00:04:23.388,00:04:28.977,"After his wife Catherine was murdered, he removed himself from anything having to do with Springsborough."
00:04:29.060,00:04:31.020,I didn't even know about this place.
00:04:31.104,00:04:34.565,"So, the unlimited energy device, that's the machine those guys are after?"
00:04:34.899,00:04:38.319,-The bad guys? Right? -The bad-- Yes.
00:04:38.403,00:04:40.655,But no one ever found it. Until now.
00:04:40.738,00:04:46.911,"-Did you find it? -No. But-- The schematic we found, it's a layout of Spring's power grid."
00:04:46.995,00:04:49.622,Including the Ridgely with only one access point.
00:04:49.706,00:04:53.167,"Would you believe, could you ever for a second imagine where that would be?"
00:04:53.960,00:04:55.420,Because it's right here.
00:04:57.672,00:05:00.925,"Jesus Christ, this thing? I drive by it every day on my way to work."
00:05:01.509,00:05:04.721,Are we gonna climb this fence? Who's climbing the fence? Me first.
00:05:08.349,00:05:11.185,-How long have you been his assistant? -Three days.
00:05:11.477,00:05:12.520,Three days?
00:05:14.397,00:05:18.234,-I assumed you'd been together for years. -Why would you think that?
00:05:18.318,00:05:20.903,Todd! Push my bum! Make me go up!
00:05:21.654,00:05:24.365,Right. No. We just met. And I hate him.
00:05:27.535,00:05:28.536,Hello.
00:05:31.956,00:05:33.708,"Hello, police detectives."
00:05:33.791,00:05:36.169,Agent Weedle. We didn't expect to see you so soon.
00:05:36.252,00:05:39.130,This situation is a mess. You got anything on Farah Black?
00:05:40.339,00:05:43.134,Lydia Spring's bodyguard? No. We haven't found her yet.
00:05:43.217,00:05:45.553,Anything I can read on her? I have some questions.
00:05:54.896,00:05:55.730,Sure.
00:05:58.483,00:06:01.194,-We're starting to think they were stolen. -We pulled them.
00:06:01.277,00:06:02.320,"I'm sorry, what?"
00:06:05.656,00:06:06.866,The FBI pulled them.
00:06:06.949,00:06:09.077,Part of a larger issue. None of your concern.
00:06:09.160,00:06:12.872,"We asked you to your face, did you transfer out the bodies?"
00:06:12.955,00:06:16.417,"Oh, yeah, well, at the time, we didn't think you needed to know."
00:06:16.501,00:06:19.837,Did you connect to Dirk Gently? I've been trying to get info on the guy.
00:06:19.921,00:06:22.090,"No Dirk Gently, Todd Brotzman walked himself in."
00:06:23.257,00:06:24.258,Brotzman?
00:06:24.342,00:06:25.384,Gently's assistant?
00:06:29.931,00:06:32.100,-What do you know about the corgi? -What corgi?
00:06:32.183,00:06:34.519,-The one you asked about. -Did you arrest Brotzman?
00:06:36.938,00:06:37.772,For what?
00:06:40.733,00:06:41.609,Are you kidding me?
00:06:42.902,00:06:46.405,"What is this, amateur hour? Are you guys just pretending to be cops?"
00:06:46.489,00:06:48.574,"Brotzman, Farah Black, Dirk Gently."
00:06:48.658,00:06:50.910,"What, these are just wild cards to you right now?"
00:06:50.993,00:06:59.877,"Does Missing Persons even get badges or what, just some type of laminated-- You're gonna have to-- Nathan."
00:07:01.754,00:07:02.713,Where's Nathan?
00:07:03.589,00:07:04.423,Nathan.
00:07:06.175,00:07:08.427,Your partner. Nathan?
00:07:12.223,00:07:14.725,-Where can I find Brotzman? -The Ridgely.
00:07:14.809,00:07:23.025,You were investigating his landlord Dorian. Shouldn't you-- I'll speak with Brotzman myself.
00:07:23.526,00:07:24.944,Straighten some things out.
00:07:26.696,00:07:27.738,I like your office.
00:07:30.867,00:07:33.119,Am I having a stroke? Could that guy not hear me?
00:07:33.202,00:07:34.996,"And two days ago, that dude was quiet."
00:07:35.329,00:07:37.707,-When did he become Billy Badass? -We said too much.
00:07:38.499,00:07:39.667,There is something wrong.
00:07:39.750,00:07:42.670,There is something... seriously wrong.
00:07:42.753,00:07:44.338,You know what he really wanted.
00:07:51.262,00:07:52.889,Something's weird about that dog.
00:08:00.646,00:08:01.481,Oh.
00:08:05.193,00:08:07.111,What do you think Patrick wants us to find?
00:08:07.445,00:08:10.198,"I mean, how do we even know he's the good guy here?"
00:08:10.281,00:08:12.992,I have to find Lydia. I messed this up.
00:08:13.075,00:08:13.910,What?
00:08:16.829,00:08:18.164,But that's not fair.
00:08:18.372,00:08:20.750,You were trying to find his kidnapped daughter.
00:08:20.833,00:08:22.376,You were handcuffed to a bed.
00:08:22.460,00:08:24.504,Yeah. That was my fault.
00:08:25.254,00:08:28.508,It was your job and you-- look.
00:08:49.987,00:08:51.989,You saw Lydia Spring.
00:08:52.073,00:08:57.411,"And as far as I can tell, the only people looking for her are him, me and you."
00:08:58.412,00:09:02.458,"Patrick knew he was gonna die, and this is the only lead he left us."
00:09:02.542,00:09:04.961,"So, we're gonna figure it out. Okay?"
00:09:05.711,00:09:06.837,Okay?
00:09:06.921,00:09:08.172,Say okay.
00:09:08.256,00:09:11.551,-Say okay. -Okay.
00:09:15.513,00:09:17.640,I've fallen in a thing.
00:09:17.723,00:09:19.350,There are traps here apparently.
00:09:19.433,00:09:23.729,It's a whole spooky-trap ancient area. Very much dangerous.
00:09:23.813,00:09:29.610,"I turned the crank, which was a mistake to do unsupervised, perhaps, now that I think about it."
00:09:29.694,00:09:32.697,What? This crank? I don't understand what-- whoa!
00:09:49.714,00:09:50.881,Nope.
00:09:50.965,00:09:53.092,Is he home? FBI.
00:09:55.052,00:09:58.180,"Wait, like, for real FBI?"
00:10:00.224,00:10:03.769,"-Okay. Well, uh, Todd's not here. -I can wait."
00:10:05.354,00:10:06.355,Just stand there?
00:10:06.439,00:10:09.859,'Cause... he might be a really long time.
00:10:20.369,00:10:24.373,What the-- -Where are we? -Underground.
00:10:24.457,00:10:27.168,"And there's a corridor, and it's dark."
00:10:27.251,00:10:29.545,"This is it. This is the clue, right?"
00:10:29.629,00:10:30.796,You're asking me?
00:10:33.299,00:10:34.342,Where are you?
00:10:36.469,00:10:38.846,Yes. That seemed like a poor choice.
00:10:40.056,00:10:41.849,Hey! Don't wander off.
00:10:41.932,00:10:44.268,I'm investigating. Oh.
00:10:47.146,00:10:51.233,"Uh, it's dark. There seems to be some kind of passage."
00:11:00.117,00:11:02.536,-Hello? -Hey. It's Amanda.
00:11:02.620,00:11:06.457,"Sorry, I tried to call Todd and Dirk but it went straight to voice mail."
00:11:06.540,00:11:07.416,Is everything cool?
00:11:08.876,00:11:10.503,It's your sister!
00:11:10.586,00:11:11.462,Is she okay?
00:11:11.545,00:11:13.839,-Are you okay? -Yeah. I'm fine.
00:11:13.923,00:11:16.008,"But, uh, there is a guy here."
00:11:16.092,00:11:16.967,"FBI, he says."
00:11:17.218,00:11:18.469,FBI? What's he want?
00:11:18.594,00:11:19.720,He's asking for Todd.
00:11:19.804,00:11:21.972,He says he'll wait outside until he comes back.
00:11:22.431,00:11:23.349,Where is Todd?
00:11:23.432,00:11:26.060,-What's Amanda saying? -She wants to know where you are.
00:11:26.143,00:11:27.978,Don't tell her I'm in a secret passage.
00:11:28.062,00:11:29.355,He's in a secret passage.
00:11:29.438,00:11:30.856,What?! Oh!
00:11:30.940,00:11:32.566,-She's excited. -Of course.
00:11:32.650,00:11:33.484,Seriously?
00:11:34.068,00:11:36.445,Wait. What do you mean he'll wait outside?
00:11:36.529,00:11:39.657,-He's not just standing outside. -That's exactly what he's doing.
00:11:39.740,00:11:41.951,That's not right. That's against protocol.
00:11:42.034,00:11:43.160,Is Amanda okay?
00:11:43.244,00:11:45.579,I'm coming back. Don't let him in.
00:11:45.663,00:11:46.497,Got it.
00:11:54.422,00:11:56.507,I'll be right back to get you out of there.
00:11:58.843,00:12:01.262,Get me out of here! Hello?
00:12:02.096,00:12:03.180,Farah!
00:12:03.764,00:12:05.891,We should definitely go down this passageway.
00:12:05.975,00:12:09.061,"Dirk, wait! Dirk, we should just stay here."
00:12:09.353,00:12:10.187,Dirk!
00:12:30.291,00:12:33.419,Hey. Gordon. Hi.
00:12:37.590,00:12:40.634,-Are you okay? -Yeah. I'm fine.
00:12:42.720,00:12:43.679,What's this?
00:12:44.388,00:12:45.264,Present.
00:12:45.347,00:12:47.725,"Oh, Gordon, I told you."
00:12:48.642,00:12:50.561,"Honey, you gotta stop getting me things."
00:12:50.644,00:12:53.439,It's just not gonna change the way I feel.
00:12:54.523,00:12:55.524,It's the last one.
00:12:57.067,00:12:57.902,Promise.
00:13:12.374,00:13:13.876,"You really cared about him, huh?"
00:13:15.294,00:13:21.175,"When he disappeared, I think everyone just sort of, you know, was waiting."
00:13:22.384,00:13:25.095,Just waiting for him to come back.
00:13:35.940,00:13:38.025,"-This FBI guy, the new boyfriend-- -Gone."
00:13:39.860,00:13:41.195,Probably back to his wife.
00:13:42.863,00:13:44.949,-What was his name again? -Nathan.
00:13:47.952,00:13:50.246,-What? -He-- Uh...
00:13:51.497,00:13:53.290,Life is wild.
00:13:54.416,00:13:55.292,I'll drink to that.
00:14:08.180,00:14:11.016,"No. Todd is coming soon, so..."
00:14:19.275,00:14:20.484,Hoped you wouldn't notice.
00:14:28.367,00:14:31.245,Are you serious? No. Get out of here right now.
00:14:31.328,00:14:32.538,You shouldn't be alone.
00:14:33.497,00:14:36.792,"If anything happened to you, who would come looking?"
00:14:43.048,00:14:43.883,Careful.
00:14:46.427,00:14:47.970,Probably earthquake damage.
00:14:51.390,00:14:53.017,Who cares? There's a door.
00:14:54.727,00:14:56.770,-You think it leads to a way out? -Possibly.
00:14:56.854,00:14:57.855,Maybe even probably.
00:15:00.107,00:15:01.275,Definitely?
00:15:02.818,00:15:03.986,Where'd you get that?
00:15:04.570,00:15:07.156,Spring's lab. Same place I got the crank that got us in.
00:15:07.239,00:15:10.200,"-You just stole stuff? -No, found."
00:15:10.284,00:15:12.494,"It's like stealing, but no one yells at you."
00:15:12.578,00:15:15.331,I call it an everbulb.
00:15:15.414,00:15:19.752,I think it's using electricity from our bodies to power itself.
00:15:19.835,00:15:22.379,Edgar was absolutely obsessed with electricity.
00:15:22.463,00:15:24.048,"Fantastic, right?"
00:15:24.131,00:15:28.052,Do you not see? Can you not comprehend how freaking weird this is?
00:15:28.636,00:15:30.971,We are now underground with a magic light bulb.
00:15:31.555,00:15:37.269,"This place has been here for decades, even if Patrick Spring hid something in his father's maze, what the hell does this guy want?"
00:15:54.578,00:15:55.496,What now?
00:15:59.875,00:16:01.126,Oh!
00:16:03.921,00:16:05.089,What is this place?
00:16:05.673,00:16:07.341,Something from Patrick Spring.
00:16:09.051,00:16:10.427,A message.
00:16:17.518,00:16:20.437,"I think the message is, You're going to die."
00:16:32.241,00:16:35.452,"We're going to be crushed, Todd, distressingly slow!"
00:16:35.953,00:16:37.830,Aah! And burnt!
00:16:37.913,00:16:40.958,Burnt and crushed to death like Watkin in Star War!
00:16:41.041,00:16:43.585,"Oh, it's too bright in here. Give me your jacket!"
00:16:43.669,00:16:45.838,-What's wrong with yours? -Give it to me now!
00:16:54.430,00:16:59.143,"Oh, well done. Now our death is even more stabbier than before!"
00:17:03.063,00:17:04.606,Kill? Or test?
00:17:05.024,00:17:07.735,He left the crank to let us in. He wants us to be here!
00:17:07.818,00:17:10.237,"Maybe he's an awful person, Todd!"
00:17:10.320,00:17:13.532,Maybe he wants to see that we have something that no one else has.
00:17:13.615,00:17:14.533,The everbulb!
00:17:15.117,00:17:16.410,Find an open socket. Now!
00:17:25.085,00:17:26.754,I got it! Got it! Give me the bulb!
00:17:34.261,00:17:37.347,-It didn't work! -Why plug in the bulb that lights itself?
00:17:37.890,00:17:39.016,Because it's not a bulb.
00:17:39.099,00:17:40.851,The bulb is a key. It's a doorknob!
00:17:58.869,00:18:00.079,"Nicely done, Todd."
00:18:02.247,00:18:03.916,How are we going to get out of here?
00:18:04.333,00:18:05.959,It's another one of those chambers.
00:18:07.294,00:18:10.255,"-There must be another door down there. -Wait, Todd."
00:18:10.839,00:18:12.633,What if there's another killer machine?
00:18:12.925,00:18:17.763,-We cannot just walk blindly into it-- -We can't just walk blindly?
00:18:18.305,00:18:19.473,You're saying this?
00:18:20.057,00:18:23.477,Come on. I'm getting out of here whether the Spring family likes it or not.
00:18:24.144,00:18:25.521,Todd?
00:18:27.356,00:18:28.690,You're close to your brother.
00:18:30.442,00:18:31.276,We're related.
00:18:31.860,00:18:33.278,And he's close to Dirk Gently.
00:18:33.362,00:18:34.947,Close might be pushing it.
00:18:35.030,00:18:36.490,Why did Todd steal our dog?
00:18:38.992,00:18:40.494,Are you high right now?
00:18:42.329,00:18:45.833,"You know, your brother is yay close to a warrant and, really, so are you."
00:18:46.416,00:18:47.960,"Aiding, abetting..."
00:18:50.754,00:18:52.047,Probable cause.
00:18:52.631,00:18:53.632,You are.
00:18:54.299,00:18:55.175,You are high.
00:19:00.556,00:19:01.431,"Hello, Amanda."
00:19:02.307,00:19:03.517,Everything okay?
00:19:04.268,00:19:05.227,I think so.
00:19:05.310,00:19:07.813,-What did he ask you? -I'm not gonna lowball this.
00:19:08.397,00:19:09.773,He's being really weird.
00:19:14.653,00:19:15.571,Join me outside.
00:19:15.654,00:19:19.825,"-Ma'am, I think we-- -Join me... outside."
00:19:32.212,00:19:34.590,-What's your interest here? -I should ask the questions.
00:19:34.673,00:19:36.341,-The Patrick Spring case? -Yes.
00:19:36.425,00:19:38.218,-Todd Brotzman's on your radar. -Yes.
00:19:38.302,00:19:40.387,-First time you knew about his sister. -Yes.
00:19:40.470,00:19:45.642,You're gonna need to lose the tone. I don't respond well to-- -Your safety's off. -What?
00:19:45.726,00:19:48.312,Wrong side. And your holster's on backwards.
00:19:49.521,00:19:50.772,"Oh, shit!"
00:19:53.942,00:19:54.776,You're so cool.
00:19:56.695,00:19:58.822,Loitering in a suspect's residence?
00:19:59.656,00:20:02.743,Unsupervised interrogation of a suspect?
00:20:03.410,00:20:04.453,Where's your partner?
00:20:06.455,00:20:08.874,Who are you? Really?
00:20:12.586,00:20:18.008,"When I first read you were Spring's bodyguard when he died, I assumed you were going to be a lot of help to us."
00:20:18.091,00:20:20.177,But you know what? Now I see it.
00:20:21.678,00:20:24.514,Now I see what stopped you from going the agency route.
00:20:27.267,00:20:28.936,The psychological portion.
00:20:31.271,00:20:34.733,I-- -I was just-- -Being careful. Right.
00:20:34.816,00:20:42.115,"The same type of being careful that led to you being refused entry into the Army Rangers, the FBI, Naval Intelligence."
00:20:42.199,00:20:44.660,"Paranoid, panic-prone, unstable."
00:20:44.743,00:20:48.163,"Christ, you just laid hands on a federal agent!"
00:20:50.791,00:20:51.708,You need help.
00:20:52.542,00:21:02.678,"You don't even-- Look, those situations were complicated and just-- Give me back my goddamn gun right now, and I won't have you arrested."
00:21:15.232,00:21:16.525,I'm not your enemy here.
00:21:17.651,00:21:22.572,"If things get any more confusing, give me a call."
00:21:23.615,00:21:25.617,Maybe we can untangle this together.
00:21:37.337,00:21:40.007,-There's no need to be in such a rush. -I'm not rushing.
00:21:40.090,00:21:42.676,"-Caution is the order of the day. -Wait, shh!"
00:21:48.432,00:21:49.558,"Okay, that's a problem."
00:21:51.977,00:21:53.979,"Okay, walls not closing in. That's good."
00:21:56.148,00:21:57.733,There has to be a way out of here.
00:21:59.901,00:22:02.863,-Oh. What is this? -Don't touch. You don't know what it does.
00:22:02.946,00:22:05.991,"-Well, it might be important. -Everything is a trap. Okay?"
00:22:06.074,00:22:08.452,"-Oh, interesting. A rhino. -A rhino?"
00:22:09.536,00:22:12.289,"-Oh, it's a door. Let's go! -No, no, no, slow down."
00:22:12.372,00:22:15.250,"We should think about this, okay? No, Todd."
00:22:15.334,00:22:21.465,"What is your deal? You're the one who keeps dragging me into these situations, and then when shit hits the fan, you fall apart."
00:22:21.548,00:22:23.383,It's not like I know things are going to end up this way.
00:22:23.467,00:22:25.177,"Okay, maybe I should see a trend."
00:22:25.260,00:22:30.807,"Dirk, I'm just trying to deal with the realities that you keep dragging me into. You climbed a fence."
00:22:30.891,00:22:32.142,You cranked the thing.
00:22:32.225,00:22:35.187,-You fell into the... thing. -Let's not reinvent the truth.
00:22:35.270,00:22:38.440,"That fence was not climbed, just ambitiously fondled."
00:22:38.523,00:22:40.776,You created this situation. Yes? No?
00:22:41.985,00:22:42.819,Yes.
00:22:43.445,00:22:46.823,We almost just died. We almost just got crushed to death.
00:22:46.907,00:22:51.995,"So, stop making jokes and acknowledge that, not in panic, but to me as a person. Okay?"
00:22:54.581,00:22:55.499,"I'm sorry, Todd."
00:22:56.666,00:22:57.542,Thank you.
00:23:00.837,00:23:04.257,"Amanda needs me, and you've trapped me in a death maze."
00:23:04.341,00:23:10.097,"You keep calling me your assistant, and I'm not that, but I'll help you if it means getting out of here. So, calm down."
00:23:10.180,00:23:11.640,-I feel reassured. -Excellent.
00:23:11.723,00:23:14.976,"Yes, despite your use of the alarming term death maze..."
00:23:16.520,00:23:19.272,-I think you're getting good at this. -Really? That's great.
00:23:19.815,00:23:20.690,-Good. -Very good.
00:23:20.774,00:23:22.025,-You're welcome. -Thank you.
00:23:25.362,00:23:28.240,-It's locked. -And you're surprised by that?
00:23:29.741,00:23:30.992,I hope you're not smiling.
00:23:44.297,00:23:47.467,"So, is my brother still in a hole five blocks away?"
00:23:48.218,00:23:50.971,I don't want to leave you alone.
00:23:57.644,00:24:00.772,I need to be sure of your safety before I can leave.
00:24:05.152,00:24:07.946,-What did your brother do? -Todd didn't do anything.
00:24:08.613,00:24:11.533,The FBI doesn't come knocking for people who didn't do anything.
00:24:14.536,00:24:16.454,Do we need a lawyer or something?
00:24:22.169,00:24:24.254,Are you gonna help me figure out this door?
00:24:24.337,00:24:26.006,It's something to do with this horn.
00:24:32.345,00:24:34.473,"Ooh, maybe it rhymes with horn."
00:24:34.556,00:24:36.850,"That'd be pretty archaeological, right?"
00:24:36.933,00:24:38.685,Maybe we're not supposed to be here.
00:24:38.768,00:24:42.147,-Maybe this was supposed to be for Farah. -No. We're on the right track.
00:24:42.230,00:24:43.523,How can you know that?
00:24:43.607,00:24:45.567,I always end up exactly where I need to be.
00:24:45.650,00:24:47.694,Despite it's rarely where I intended to go.
00:24:47.777,00:24:50.989,Sometimes you just say stuff and it's like you're just saying stuff.
00:24:51.072,00:24:52.449,"Todd, you're not making sense."
00:24:53.492,00:24:54.784,What's this?
00:24:57.787,00:25:01.166,Here lies Pepe. Unless otherwise activated.
00:25:01.541,00:25:03.293,-What's that supposed to mean? -Pepe.
00:25:04.336,00:25:06.504,Pepe! The family rhino.
00:25:06.922,00:25:10.717,"That belonged to Patrick Spring, not Edgar, so, he's been down here."
00:25:11.218,00:25:14.596,It was Patrick who left us the key or crank or whatever.
00:25:19.935,00:25:20.977,That's the door.
00:25:22.020,00:25:24.731,It's opening. All I had to do was touch this thing.
00:25:24.814,00:25:27.067,"-Whoa, uh, hey, wait. -Now, you say wait."
00:25:27.150,00:25:30.737,"-I thought you were all gung ho now, Todd. -I'm gung ho, not suicidal."
00:25:30.820,00:25:34.241,"-We have to see what it-- -Come on, Todd. It's just a bloody door."
00:25:34.324,00:25:51.633,It's not going to-- -Aah! -Deadly door! Haunted door!
00:25:51.716,00:25:53.760,-I'm burning! I'm burning! -I'm burnt.
00:25:55.136,00:25:56.012,I'm burnt!
00:26:00.934,00:26:02.477,What the hell is that thing?
00:26:02.894,00:26:04.771,-Pepe. -Pepe?
00:26:05.397,00:26:09.359,Energy. Some kind of electrical ghost rhino?
00:26:09.442,00:26:12.153,Electric ghost? How do we get out of here?
00:26:12.237,00:26:18.076,If that thing charges again-- You had to say that.
00:26:18.159,00:26:20.245,Think. What are we missing?
00:26:25.041,00:26:27.711,Todd! The horn! We have to connect the horn!
00:26:27.794,00:26:29.796,We can't connect that. It's too big. It won't fit.
00:26:29.879,00:26:32.173,"Quick, Todd! Help me with this. It's stuck fast!"
00:26:32.257,00:26:34.426,Connect. Right. Connect the horn.
00:26:35.135,00:26:37.762,"-Dirk, grab my hand. -What are you talking about?"
00:26:38.346,00:26:40.932,Please. Just trust me. I know what I'm doing.
00:26:45.103,00:26:46.730,-I think. -What?
00:26:55.488,00:26:56.323,Is he gone?
00:27:01.494,00:27:02.412,He's gone!
00:27:14.424,00:27:16.009,How did you know that would work?
00:27:17.594,00:27:18.678,Conductivity.
00:27:19.429,00:27:20.847,Connect the rhino to the horn.
00:27:21.348,00:27:23.725,Have secret scientific knowledge you aren't sharing?
00:27:23.808,00:27:25.310,I used to play electric guitar.
00:27:25.393,00:27:27.854,-How many times you electrocuted yourself? -Enough.
00:27:28.772,00:27:32.817,"-Well, I hope you're not claustrophobic. -No, I don't even like coffee."
00:27:37.864,00:27:41.159,"Stuck it out, but the woman was there, protecting the sister."
00:27:41.618,00:27:45.497,This is spiraling out of control. This has been spiraling out of control!
00:27:47.165,00:27:49.793,Don't be ridiculous. I'll be there soon.
00:27:57.342,00:27:58.176,I just...
00:27:59.594,00:28:01.513,I-- I lost my dog.
00:28:02.097,00:28:07.519,"Nothing I can't handle. Here, just open-- Open your present."
00:28:10.188,00:28:11.064,Gordon.
00:28:18.405,00:28:19.280,What is this?
00:28:20.240,00:28:22.158,It was made by an artisan in Tibet.
00:28:22.659,00:28:23.535,Yak fur.
00:28:24.327,00:28:27.038,Meant to symbolize the endless cycle of the universe.
00:28:29.082,00:28:30.333,That's Lux's story.
00:28:32.794,00:28:34.003,This is Lux's coat.
00:28:40.301,00:28:42.345,Do you want to know what happened to Lux?
00:28:43.763,00:28:46.141,"Where he went, what he did?"
00:28:48.560,00:28:49.853,You loved him.
00:28:50.478,00:28:51.688,Come with me now.
00:28:53.648,00:28:55.692,I can show you everything.
00:29:01.072,00:29:02.490,Is it another puzzle?
00:29:02.574,00:29:04.909,"Um... Dirk, I don't know about this one."
00:29:06.703,00:29:08.037,"Oh, Jesus."
00:29:09.080,00:29:11.291,What if there's a hundred more rooms like this?
00:29:15.628,00:29:16.546,The Ridgely?
00:29:17.338,00:29:18.631,It led us all the way back.
00:29:18.715,00:29:21.593,Everything is connected. And I think this is the end.
00:29:25.263,00:29:27.807,I am perfectly qualified.
00:29:27.891,00:29:29.851,I was in contention. What does he know?
00:29:31.519,00:29:34.022,He's a stupid little know-nothing not-knower...
00:29:37.734,00:29:39.360,"You're kind of a weird person, huh?"
00:29:39.444,00:29:41.529,"No, I'm not. I'm a normal person."
00:29:41.613,00:29:44.365,"But you're weird, too. You're like a weird normal."
00:29:44.449,00:29:49.746,I am a perfectly regular person who can blend seamlessly in with others.
00:30:00.548,00:30:01.758,-Clearly. -Yeah.
00:30:04.677,00:30:06.346,FBI guy's finally leaving.
00:30:20.610,00:30:22.403,Shouldn't we call Todd and Dirk?
00:30:25.532,00:30:28.993,"There was another thingy just like this thingy in the secret lab, Todd."
00:30:29.077,00:30:32.038,"This plug thingy, it's the same thingy."
00:30:32.831,00:30:37.168,This must be the thingy that allowed Edgar Spring to power Springsborough.
00:30:41.714,00:30:43.550,"Well, certainly not what it's doing now."
00:30:52.225,00:30:53.142,What does this mean?
00:30:54.936,00:30:56.104,I have no idea.
00:30:59.858,00:31:01.192,Kitten.
00:31:04.988,00:31:06.239,Shark.
00:31:08.533,00:31:10.952,How did you-- Kitten and the shark.
00:31:11.786,00:31:14.914,"Of course. So, that means-- Of course? What of course?"
00:31:18.167,00:31:19.460,Girl.
00:31:19.544,00:31:21.129,-This makes sense. -It does?
00:31:25.091,00:31:26.718,"Well, it did until right now."
00:31:27.552,00:31:28.386,Uh...
00:31:29.345,00:31:30.179,Unless...
00:31:31.097,00:31:34.183,"One, three. Three questions, one answer."
00:31:37.228,00:31:40.398,-Huh?! -How could you have possibly known that?
00:31:45.445,00:31:46.279,What was that?
00:31:47.322,00:31:48.323,"Uh, this is bad."
00:31:48.406,00:31:50.408,It's too damaged. The room is broken!
00:31:51.659,00:31:54.579,Todd. Look. I'm not freaking out.
00:32:00.209,00:32:01.502,They're still not picking up.
00:32:05.632,00:32:06.507,I should go.
00:32:07.884,00:32:11.638,-What's happening? What's wrong? -I think I'm having an attack.
00:32:13.264,00:32:14.265,What should I do?
00:32:14.766,00:32:16.017,I smell fire.
00:32:16.601,00:32:18.144,"Wait. Me, too."
00:32:24.192,00:32:25.485,"Oh, shit."
00:32:31.950,00:32:34.285,-Is this the front of the building? -Uh...
00:32:54.097,00:32:57.266,Break through the wall! Break through the wall!
00:32:57.350,00:32:59.060,"-Farah, what's happening? -They're trapped."
00:32:59.727,00:33:00.895,"Todd, get down!"
00:33:14.492,00:33:16.119,"Amanda, stay back."
00:33:26.087,00:33:27.255,Todd!
00:33:38.182,00:33:40.059,"Oh, no. Not this again."
00:33:59.287,00:34:00.997,Who are those guys?
00:34:04.083,00:34:06.794,This is the coolest thing that has ever happened to you.
00:34:08.171,00:34:09.130,Being burnt alive?
00:34:09.213,00:34:11.632,Almost burnt alive. It's so punk.
00:34:11.716,00:34:14.218,-Too bad about your jacket. -I'll live.
00:34:14.302,00:34:15.928,I was talking to Todd.
00:34:16.929,00:34:21.768,"The way you made it sound, that maze was made for you specifically."
00:34:22.226,00:34:24.312,That's impossible.
00:34:24.395,00:34:31.486,"Edgar Spring must've built the power node and the maze for his unlimited energy device, but the traps were all Patrick's doing."
00:34:31.569,00:34:34.572,Why would he do that? Why would he send us down there?
00:34:35.073,00:34:36.908,"Maybe it was for you, Farah."
00:34:36.991,00:34:38.326,Maybe we did something wrong.
00:34:38.409,00:34:40.036,-What about the map? -What map?
00:34:40.745,00:34:42.705,"-The map to the power node? -No, a new map."
00:34:44.707,00:34:46.042,He's mapping way too much.
00:34:46.125,00:34:48.503,It showed up right before the place started to blow.
00:34:48.586,00:34:51.839,"-I mean, it was just a second, but-- -Wait, there was a map?"
00:34:53.049,00:34:54.967,"On, like, a bunch of screens?"
00:34:55.593,00:34:58.346,"Yes, but only for a second."
00:35:11.234,00:35:12.443,Hey. Amanda?
00:35:13.277,00:35:14.112,Wait!
00:35:17.865,00:35:22.495,There's something here. Like a-- a socket.
00:35:23.621,00:35:24.455,Will this fit?
00:35:42.181,00:35:43.808,Holy shit.
00:35:46.477,00:35:47.812,How did you know to do that?
00:35:48.896,00:35:51.649,-Hunch. -Wildly suspicious.
00:35:51.732,00:35:52.942,And yours aren't?
00:35:56.904,00:35:58.865,No. No way.
00:36:00.867,00:36:03.286,How could he possibly know our names?
00:36:03.828,00:36:05.413,This is Skagit Valley.
00:36:05.496,00:36:06.706,It's four hours from here.
00:36:07.206,00:36:09.584,A treasure map. We leave first thing in the morning.
00:36:09.667,00:36:10.585,We?
00:36:12.211,00:36:13.045,Right.
00:36:14.213,00:36:16.591,"I suppose it could be very dangerous, couldn't it?"
00:36:19.594,00:36:20.720,I guess we'll see.
00:36:31.439,00:36:33.274,There you go. There's Lux.
00:36:36.485,00:36:38.571,This is all Lux's stuff?
00:36:39.530,00:36:45.703,How-- Oh. Oh. Oh!
00:36:51.918,00:36:53.085,What did you do to him?
00:36:53.794,00:36:56.172,We found this thing in the '60s.
00:36:56.255,00:37:00.134,It came to us from another dimension or something.
00:37:00.885,00:37:04.764,And then we figured out that we could swap bodies with it.
00:37:05.598,00:37:10.144,We started with animals at first. It was a spiritual thing.
00:37:10.853,00:37:20.780,"And then we realized we could-- we could kidnap rich people and swap bodies with them and then when they outlive their usefulness, we'd just kill them and swap back."
00:37:21.322,00:37:25.076,"Mostly it was retired folks, but then we got ambitious."
00:37:25.159,00:37:30.206,Athletes and famous actors and... uh...
00:37:30.748,00:37:33.751,Ah. Rock stars.
00:37:34.877,00:37:36.379,We've been doing this for...
00:37:38.297,00:37:39.882,"Christ, 50 years."
00:37:40.383,00:37:41.384,You're crazy.
00:37:48.599,00:37:50.559,I jumped into him after the second album.
00:37:52.061,00:37:53.354,That was the comeback.
00:37:57.650,00:38:00.820,You never even met the real Lux. He was long gone by then.
00:38:00.903,00:38:02.446,He was not even-- I don't know.
00:38:09.370,00:38:11.998,I want you to meet some of my friends.
00:38:16.460,00:38:17.920,"You, Fred."
00:38:19.088,00:38:20.798,No. No.
00:38:21.340,00:38:23.801,You did good today.
00:38:25.678,00:38:26.595,I'm not mad.
00:38:27.888,00:38:34.437,"I brought you here, I brought all of you here, to show you that I am doing my part."
00:38:35.438,00:38:42.611,I brought all of you here to show you that what they say about me isn't true.
00:38:47.658,00:38:56.751,"See, Spring's machine is, uh-- is within our grasp."
00:38:58.544,00:38:59.879,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:02.214,00:39:03.341,Within our grasp.
00:39:04.508,00:39:08.721,"We know where they are, where they all are."
00:39:08.804,00:39:13.601,"The detective, the bodyguard, the bellboy, his sister."
00:39:14.185,00:39:16.187,We will find that other machine.
00:39:16.270,00:39:17.813,This is our destiny.
00:39:20.024,00:39:21.650,It's why I brought her here today.
00:39:29.784,00:39:30.785,To show you...
00:39:32.661,00:39:36.499,I've outgrown all these things.
00:39:38.834,00:39:43.339,I don't want the things that Lux wanted anymore.
00:39:45.925,00:39:49.261,I am taking back control!
00:39:56.977,00:39:57.812,Sammy.
00:40:02.149,00:40:08.531,Do you remember when we were together on that yacht off the coast of Portugal?
00:40:09.532,00:40:10.616,Do you remember?
00:40:17.123,00:40:21.001,"Sammy, do you remember when you still loved me?"
00:40:23.462,00:40:25.923,Before I was all this?
00:40:37.935,00:40:39.937,Do you remember what I told you?
00:40:41.313,00:40:44.400,"When I die, you die."
00:40:44.483,00:40:45.443,Yes.
00:40:47.528,00:40:48.362,Lux.
00:40:50.489,00:40:51.657,What happened to you?
00:00:34.743,00:00:35.869,"Rapunzel, get over here!"
00:00:46.755,00:00:48.047,I'm sorry I did this to you.
00:00:49.257,00:00:50.091,It was selfish.
00:01:01.019,00:01:02.979,When I'm finished with this little bitch...
00:01:05.565,00:01:06.399,boom.
00:01:08.318,00:01:09.944,Get out of here. Get out of here now.
00:02:17.804,00:02:18.638,Is this it?
00:02:20.348,00:02:21.432,We're out of gas.
00:02:22.350,00:02:24.310,And doesn't that mean something's gonna...?
00:02:30.859,00:02:32.485,Yes. Or deaths.
00:02:34.737,00:02:35.655,Something's weird.
00:02:36.823,00:02:37.907,Just one thing?
00:02:37.991,00:02:41.911,There's no-- There's no Dirk Gently here.
00:02:43.246,00:02:44.455,Seattle's a big city.
00:02:46.207,00:02:49.127,"Either I go to the target, or the target goes to me."
00:02:49.210,00:02:50.670,The city's just the backdrop.
00:02:53.798,00:02:57.927,"So, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna stand here until something happens."
00:02:58.011,00:02:58.845,You're gonna...
00:02:59.220,00:03:00.972,We're parked in front of a bus stop.
00:03:05.977,00:03:06.853,Okay.
00:03:14.402,00:03:16.738,How do we know what we're looking for is buried?
00:03:16.821,00:03:19.699,-Treasure is always buried. -Who said anything about treasure?
00:03:19.782,00:03:21.868,"We have no idea what we're looking for, do we?"
00:03:21.951,00:03:27.081,"What was all that stuff you said in the trap room -about three questions, one answer? -You're right."
00:03:27.165,00:03:32.837,At this point I feel like it is just going to lead to seven more maps leading to seven more secret rooms in seven more basements.
00:03:32.921,00:03:36.966,"Well, we dig it up and we get back home. I don't like leaving Amanda alone."
00:03:37.050,00:03:39.677,It'll be all right. We've got this under control.
00:03:39.761,00:03:44.140,I'm relieved we got through the drive without anyone or anything trying to kill us.
00:03:55.193,00:03:57.278,Think he'd tell us if it meant finding Lydia.
00:03:57.362,00:04:02.200,"I'm not saying he knows where Lydia is, but he certainly knows who Patrick Spring's enemies were."
00:04:06.329,00:04:09.165,"This stuff happens to you all the time, doesn't it?"
00:04:09.249,00:04:11.209,"-Hmm? -I mean, weird things."
00:04:11.626,00:04:13.920,-Supernatural things. -What's weird?
00:04:14.504,00:04:17.757,Patrick Spring knowing you and I would meet and solve those traps?
00:04:17.840,00:04:19.676,"Yes, it could have been a coincidence."
00:04:19.759,00:04:22.178,No. No way. You don't just stumble into that.
00:04:22.262,00:04:24.389,"Technically, we did just stumble into that."
00:04:24.472,00:04:28.685,"Okay, you know what I mean. There's some kind of thing, like a power."
00:04:28.768,00:04:31.562,A power? No. I'm just a man. A normal detective man.
00:04:31.646,00:04:40.363,"No. There's some other thing. This holistic stuff is garbage. It's-- -It's you. There's something about you. -Look, I'm not psychic. Drop it."
00:04:43.491,00:04:45.118,"-Didn't you? -Did I, though?"
00:04:45.785,00:04:49.455,"Go back to complaining. This isn't-- No, no. We are having this conversation."
00:04:49.539,00:04:51.958,"Here, let's do an experiment."
00:04:58.715,00:05:00.633,-Tell me what I drew on the napkin. -No.
00:05:00.717,00:05:03.469,"-Why not? -Look, I can't explain it, okay?"
00:05:04.053,00:05:07.223,I learned things don't always make sense the way people want them to.
00:05:07.307,00:05:09.475,"I accept that, and you're going to have to, too."
00:05:09.559,00:05:12.395,"Too. To, too. To. Two?"
00:05:12.478,00:05:14.731,You wanna do everything. Why don't you wanna do this?
00:05:14.814,00:05:19.235,"Look, I don't time for, or interest in, talking about your stupid picture of a cowboy."
00:05:22.238,00:05:23.364,"Hey. Hey, hey, wait!"
00:06:07.825,00:06:08.826,What are you doing?
00:06:09.452,00:06:13.289,"Oh, that nice chef traded me this jeep for the Corvette."
00:06:13.373,00:06:15.041,"Traded the-- Wait, what?"
00:06:15.124,00:06:20.046,"-Why? -Well, I showed him our map, and he said we couldn't get to where we needed to go in that car."
00:06:20.129,00:06:21.756,We're going off-road.
00:06:21.839,00:06:24.008,"Wait, you traded the Corvette for this?"
00:06:24.092,00:06:25.968,"Oh, don't worry. It was just a rental."
00:06:26.552,00:06:30.306,"Oh, here. I got you this new shirt in the gift shop."
00:06:41.692,00:06:42.777,We're wasting daylight.
00:06:49.951,00:06:51.619,Now... um...
00:06:51.702,00:06:53.413,"So, do I... um..."
00:06:53.996,00:06:54.831,And then...
00:07:12.223,00:07:15.726,"Normally, confronting these subjects would be a 40-man operation."
00:07:16.060,00:07:17.687,I'd want ten men for every one of them.
00:07:17.770,00:07:21.065,"I appreciate your confidence in me providing adequate support, sir."
00:07:21.357,00:07:23.151,That's not exactly what I was saying.
00:07:24.444,00:07:27.864,Under no circumstances are you to engage unless I give the word.
00:07:27.947,00:07:30.700,Understood. May I suggest cinnamon?
00:07:31.284,00:07:33.453,-What? -As the word you give?
00:07:34.203,00:07:35.455,In situations like this...
00:07:35.830,00:07:42.462,"Well, in different situations, I use the word cinnamon, so-- Corporal Friedkin, did you read the files I gave you?"
00:07:42.545,00:07:43.963,"Yes, sir. I read them."
00:07:46.466,00:07:50.136,"It was a couple days ago, though, and some of the words were hard to understand."
00:07:50.219,00:07:52.722,The Rowdy 3 are Project Incubus.
00:07:52.805,00:07:55.266,They were some of the first subjects taken into Black Wing.
00:07:55.349,00:07:58.769,They subside through the extortion of psychic energy.
00:07:58.853,00:08:01.230,"Originally, we classified them as vampires."
00:08:01.314,00:08:07.278,"Whoa. Well, shouldn't we have, like, wooden stakes, then -and golden bullets? -No."
00:08:11.699,00:08:14.952,We're not trying to kill anyone. Just... follow my lead.
00:08:15.828,00:08:16.871,Sir...
00:08:17.788,00:08:21.792,"if you don't mind me asking, why didn't they send you any backup?"
00:08:21.876,00:08:26.172,"I mean, why didn't they send you more backup?"
00:08:27.048,00:08:29.675,It has been suggested that I'm too close.
00:08:31.636,00:08:38.684,"Too emotionally involved, that blinds me to the realities of the situation, but the truth is no one knows these people the way I do."
00:08:38.768,00:08:43.189,"If we handle this calmly, these men can be reasoned with."
00:08:43.856,00:08:44.690,Understood?
00:08:47.568,00:08:48.778,Cinnamon.
00:08:49.862,00:08:50.696,No.
00:08:52.532,00:08:53.366,No.
00:08:57.620,00:09:00.748,"Are you sure it was a safe idea to get into a van with a bunch of, uh..."
00:09:02.542,00:09:05.586,Are you sure it's a safe idea to let a crazy stranger in your van?
00:09:06.587,00:09:08.798,-She totally flipped it! -Flippity flop-flop flipped!
00:09:09.298,00:09:14.345,"Well, this is not the first van full of assholes that I've ridden around in. Except I was usually drunk."
00:09:17.348,00:09:18.849,-Bottoms up! -Drink it!
00:09:23.271,00:09:27.692,"So, who are-- -Are you guys like-- -I'm Martin."
00:09:30.778,00:09:32.947,"-and that one there, he's Cross. -I'm Cross."
00:09:33.030,00:09:39.579,-That's what he said. -You're Dirk's friends or-- -Who's Dirk? -The guy that you've been following.
00:09:39.662,00:09:43.833,"The-- The British guy who you do, like, the zappy thing to."
00:09:43.916,00:09:44.834,That's your friend.
00:09:44.917,00:09:47.878,-He ain't no friend of ours. -He's not our friend. He's British.
00:09:48.504,00:09:51.507,We've been following him around since his energy tastes so good.
00:09:51.966,00:09:53.884,"He's got gourmet panic, ain't that right?"
00:09:56.137,00:09:58.264,"What are you guys, like, hippies?"
00:09:58.347,00:09:59.974,-Hmm? Mnh-mnh. -No.
00:10:00.057,00:10:01.309,Is that what you did to me?
00:10:01.934,00:10:04.395,"You, like, ate my emotions?"
00:10:04.478,00:10:06.522,You sucked the energy out of my nerves?
00:10:06.606,00:10:10.234,"You catch on quick. Now, that thing you got, it's like a..."
00:10:11.027,00:10:13.321,How would you say? A buffet for us.
00:10:13.404,00:10:16.991,"-Mmm. -Like fear. Mmm. Nom, nom, nom. Pain. Ow!"
00:10:18.951,00:10:21.287,-Confusion. Caw-caw! -It was so crazy!
00:10:21.370,00:10:24.749,We've never seen anything like it before. You were like gonzo nutballs!
00:10:24.832,00:10:26.834,"Yeah, your eyes were all funny."
00:10:28.210,00:10:29.253,You see anything cool?
00:10:30.463,00:10:31.297,Yeah.
00:10:35.009,00:10:37.511,"Rimmer? Sure, I know him. He works here."
00:10:38.304,00:10:40.306,That was Gordon Rimmer's house that burnt down?
00:10:43.100,00:10:47.229,"Wait, so you think Gordon had something to do with that body that was found in his house?"
00:10:47.313,00:10:49.982,-Was it really Lux DuJour? -It's part of an investigation.
00:10:51.233,00:10:55.529,-Can't believe he's dead. -You don't seem surprised that Gordon Rimmer might have been involved.
00:10:55.613,00:10:57.198,I think everybody saw that coming.
00:10:57.782,00:10:59.158,"-Why? -Well, the guy's a prick."
00:11:00.368,00:11:02.620,Did you work closely with him?
00:11:02.703,00:11:03.871,No. Thank God.
00:11:06.749,00:11:08.626,-But it's abandoned now. -What's in it?
00:11:09.460,00:11:10.711,-Nothing. -Nothing.
00:11:11.170,00:11:12.088,Really?
00:11:13.339,00:11:14.173,Yeah.
00:11:14.757,00:11:20.346,You're saying that there's an abandoned building on zoo property -that Gordon Rimmer had access to? -Yeah.
00:11:20.429,00:11:23.182,It's condemned. It was supposed to get torn down.
00:11:23.265,00:11:25.142,Think we can get a look at this building?
00:11:25.643,00:11:27.311,-I don't have keys. -Who has keys?
00:11:27.395,00:11:30.064,You'll have to talk to the operations manager.
00:11:30.147,00:11:32.066,-Thank you for your time. -No problem.
00:11:41.742,00:11:43.661,How do we know this is the right spot?
00:11:43.994,00:11:45.704,The map isn't exactly specific.
00:11:45.788,00:11:48.457,Patrick Spring obviously believed in us.
00:11:48.541,00:11:51.085,I hoped you'd randomly lead us to the exact place.
00:11:51.168,00:11:52.461,I did.
00:11:52.545,00:11:55.506,"No, I stopped to check the map and you got out to start digging."
00:11:55.589,00:11:58.259,I'm sure it'll all work out as long as we find the thing.
00:11:58.342,00:11:59.844,And what's that again?
00:11:59.927,00:12:02.179,Well... we'll know it when we find it.
00:12:02.763,00:12:03.931,-You are psychic. -No.
00:12:04.014,00:12:06.183,I'm... digging.
00:12:15.693,00:12:16.569,Oof.
00:12:17.778,00:12:18.612,You hungry?
00:12:18.696,00:12:20.406,"-No. -Well, I'm starving."
00:12:20.489,00:12:23.242,There's a restaurant there. You want me to bring something?
00:12:24.201,00:12:25.828,-Doesn't matter. -Look...
00:12:32.418,00:12:33.752,eating some human food?
00:12:38.757,00:12:39.675,What's this?
00:12:43.053,00:12:45.890,"Yeah, pork. You know? Pig?"
00:12:48.267,00:12:49.560,Why do people call it pork?
00:12:49.643,00:12:52.104,"So, they don't feel guilty about eating pigs."
00:12:52.730,00:12:54.607,I never seen any of this before.
00:12:54.690,00:12:57.526,-You've never had Chinese food? -I never been to China.
00:12:57.610,00:13:00.112,But you must've eaten it in a restaurant.
00:13:00.613,00:13:02.656,Food comes to me when I'm supposed to eat it.
00:13:03.782,00:13:04.825,"Hey, listen, um..."
00:13:05.826,00:13:08.120,you wouldn't happen to have any money?
00:13:13.626,00:13:15.461,"$17,000."
00:13:21.383,00:13:23.969,-Whose rooms are these? -It's ours.
00:13:24.470,00:13:26.597,What? How?
00:13:26.680,00:13:28.933,"I-- It's a hotel. I mean, have you ever..."
00:13:30.768,00:13:32.937,You've never slept in a hotel room before.
00:13:33.437,00:13:37.817,"All this stuff, your own room, it's kind of a parade just to sleep, right?"
00:13:41.904,00:13:43.239,"Okay, I'm gonna take a shower."
00:13:44.031,00:13:45.533,They got a shower in here?
00:13:49.954,00:13:50.955,"Bart, you okay?"
00:13:52.665,00:13:54.542,As much as I ever am.
00:13:55.543,00:13:57.711,"Well, you've been in there a while."
00:14:00.172,00:14:03.050,-This drink tastes bad. -Drink? What?
00:14:03.676,00:14:06.095,"No, no, no, that's shampoo."
00:14:06.178,00:14:08.097,Don't drink that. That's for your hair.
00:14:08.180,00:14:10.641,"Well, why does it got fruit on the bottle?"
00:14:13.352,00:14:14.353,"Hey, Ken?"
00:14:15.396,00:14:16.313,Yeah.
00:14:17.481,00:14:18.774,You're still here.
00:14:23.612,00:14:26.031,"Hmm. Yeah, I am."
00:14:29.368,00:14:30.202,Dirk.
00:14:31.704,00:14:33.205,Don't tell me you're giving up.
00:14:33.289,00:14:38.460,"We've only dug, like, what, 30... million holes?"
00:14:39.044,00:14:42.882,"Yeah, I think we're in the wrong spot. Like, we gotta double-check the map."
00:14:42.965,00:14:45.801,What if maybe the X's aren't even for something buried?
00:14:45.885,00:14:49.430,We have to dig somewhere. I think the ground is a great place to start.
00:14:49.513,00:14:50.973,You're right. I take it back.
00:14:51.056,00:14:52.725,-You're not psychic. -What a relief.
00:14:53.350,00:14:54.518,"Look, it's late."
00:14:54.602,00:14:57.771,Let's pack it in for the night and try another one in the morning.
00:14:57.855,00:14:59.690,"You gain nothing from giving up, Todd."
00:14:59.773,00:15:02.276,"Don't start with the Zen master stuff, okay?"
00:15:02.359,00:15:05.446,"It worked a lot better before I figured out you were a mess, too."
00:15:06.155,00:15:07.781,"Fair point, I suppose."
00:15:08.908,00:15:11.994,But wouldn't it just be one more thing you walked away from?
00:15:12.578,00:15:14.455,I was thinking about those trap rooms.
00:15:14.538,00:15:17.082,"How you solved them, but then there's always another."
00:15:17.166,00:15:20.085,"And I think maybe life is like that, too."
00:15:20.169,00:15:24.340,Just an endless series of rooms with puzzles in and eventually one of them kills you.
00:15:24.924,00:15:26.258,That's dark and depressing.
00:15:26.342,00:15:28.427,"Well, giving up is an answer, I suppose."
00:15:28.510,00:15:31.430,"It'd certainly be easier, but it's an easy road to nowhere."
00:15:31.513,00:15:35.476,What if one more shovel in the dirt is all it would take?
00:15:38.938,00:15:41.565,Go ahead. One more and then we quit.
00:15:42.650,00:15:43.692,"No, you're right, Todd."
00:15:44.652,00:15:46.779,Let's move to Kansas and be farmers. Come on.
00:15:46.862,00:15:50.449,"-No. One more just to prove me wrong. -No. When you're right, you're right."
00:15:50.532,00:15:52.284,"You wanna try one more, try one more."
00:15:55.579,00:15:57.706,"I get it, but now I can't leave."
00:16:24.316,00:16:25.150,What is it?
00:16:27.069,00:16:28.404,A thing.
00:16:40.833,00:16:42.876,"Let's go, boys. Show Drummer how we have fun."
00:16:45.754,00:16:46.839,"Hey, stop."
00:17:03.689,00:17:05.774,Go on. Hurt it.
00:17:16.118,00:17:17.786,Come on. Yeah.
00:17:18.954,00:17:20.539,Yeah!
00:17:21.415,00:17:22.791,Yeah!
00:17:50.569,00:17:52.905,You're not gonna have to worry about that shit anymore.
00:18:17.805,00:18:19.431,"Well, of course I did."
00:18:21.975,00:18:24.436,Ever gonna tell me why you took it from the crime scene?
00:18:24.520,00:18:26.855,-Hunch? -Of course.
00:18:34.696,00:18:36.698,I haven't slept in a car since my last band.
00:18:36.782,00:18:37.616,When was that?
00:18:39.993,00:18:41.203,Um...
00:18:41.286,00:18:43.580,Must be six years ago now.
00:18:45.666,00:18:48.585,I-- It didn't end... perfect.
00:18:49.086,00:18:51.338,I actually kind of messed it up pretty bad.
00:18:52.005,00:18:56.343,"Some not great, no, some-- Some really bad choices."
00:18:59.346,00:19:02.057,"You know, Todd, something I've learned is that..."
00:19:03.267,00:19:04.601,when I'm looking behind me...
00:19:05.561,00:19:06.770,I can't see ahead of me.
00:19:08.814,00:19:11.859,Are you saying that dwelling on my past is holding me back?
00:19:11.942,00:19:14.570,"No, I literally can't see over there when I'm looking back there."
00:19:16.446,00:19:18.448,Which is why it's good to have you here.
00:19:19.867,00:19:22.911,"Together, we can see in two places at once."
00:19:25.622,00:19:28.167,Wanna dig up some more weird crap buried by a dead guy?
00:19:28.584,00:19:30.169,More than anything else in the world.
00:19:53.734,00:19:55.944,What does this have to do with the missing girl?
00:19:56.028,00:19:59.907,"Well, we have reason to believe that she was last seen with Gordon Rimmer."
00:20:00.574,00:20:03.118,"By the, uh-- by the bellhop."
00:20:03.202,00:20:05.037,"-Yeah, by the bellhop. -By Todd Brotzman."
00:20:05.120,00:20:05.954,Todd Brotzman.
00:20:06.038,00:20:09.708,"Plus, we spoke to the top zoo official about getting into where Rimmer worked."
00:20:09.791,00:20:12.294,"Said the place, the Animal Transfer Unit, is condemned."
00:20:12.377,00:20:13.503,-Locked up. -Nothing there.
00:20:13.587,00:20:15.130,"Nothing there, so they say."
00:20:17.090,00:20:19.468,"So, please, why can't we go inside, take a look?"
00:20:19.551,00:20:22.137,It doesn't sound like you got enough for a warrant.
00:20:23.055,00:20:23.889,What?
00:20:25.265,00:20:26.475,"What is this, a joke?"
00:20:27.601,00:20:30.979,Gordon Rimmer was seen with Lydia Spring.
00:20:31.063,00:20:35.067,The very next day his house burns down. They find a body inside.
00:20:35.150,00:20:38.654,His dog was visible on a tape from the Perriman Grand.
00:20:38.737,00:20:39.655,His dog.
00:20:40.364,00:20:47.537,And now we're telling you we have access to an abandoned building where he used to work and you're telling us we can't go inside?!
00:20:47.621,00:20:49.748,Animal Control never followed up on that shark.
00:20:49.831,00:20:55.587,Plus Animal Control-- I don't see it.
00:20:55.671,00:20:58.423,I don't think a judge will either. Move on.
00:21:12.062,00:21:12.896,What was that?
00:21:13.647,00:21:15.774,What just happened to us? Am I losing my mind?
00:21:15.857,00:21:17.943,"No, you're not losing your mind. I don't know."
00:21:18.026,00:21:21.738,"Maybe he's covering for some major crime shit-fit, I don't know."
00:21:22.197,00:21:24.908,-We're not wasting any more time. -What are you thinking?
00:21:33.917,00:21:35.836,Are we sure this is all of them?
00:21:41.508,00:21:43.468,"Here, here. Like this."
00:21:47.723,00:21:49.933,"Ah, yes, no, I was just about to do that."
00:21:52.394,00:21:54.313,"Tremendous assisting, Todd."
00:21:55.772,00:21:57.024,What do you think this is?
00:21:57.107,00:21:59.776,"Maybe Edgar Spring's machine, the unlimited energy device."
00:22:00.360,00:22:05.198,"-Really? -I don't know, but if we can trade it for Lydia Spring, I should think it's our top priority."
00:22:06.575,00:22:08.994,"Listen, Dirk, I've been meaning to ask you something."
00:22:12.873,00:22:15.459,-See things? -Like visions of the future?
00:22:16.710,00:22:18.503,"-No, of course not. -Okay, right."
00:22:18.587,00:22:24.301,"This-- This might sound crazy, but when you gave me this shirt, it-- Okay."
00:22:25.260,00:22:26.595,I've seen this shirt before.
00:22:27.679,00:22:31.600,"The day it all happened, the day Patrick Spring died, I saw something."
00:22:32.350,00:22:45.739,"I saw something really-- Oh, shit!"
00:22:51.995,00:22:52.871,Dirk!
00:22:55.916,00:22:57.876,"Jed, get down! He's got the shark!"
00:23:31.618,00:23:33.036,Kitten and a shark.
00:23:34.746,00:23:37.124,The kitten is the shark.
00:23:38.166,00:23:39.000,Todd...
00:23:41.211,00:23:43.296,I think we found the murder weapon.
00:23:52.806,00:23:54.891,They're close. I'll handle it.
00:23:55.809,00:23:57.185,You watch from here.
00:24:00.647,00:24:02.357,Don't move.
00:24:03.150,00:24:03.984,Got it.
00:24:13.869,00:24:14.870,Come on!
00:24:22.961,00:24:26.131,"Vogle, boys, we need to talk. Martin, we need to talk."
00:24:28.133,00:24:29.426,You should not be here.
00:24:31.720,00:24:34.681,-The Rowdy 3 ain't got no use for you. -Simmer down.
00:24:38.268,00:24:40.312,-Shut up with that shit! -Kiss your mother with that mouth?
00:24:40.395,00:24:44.691,You've stepped into a nasty situation. You don't tell us what to do no more.
00:24:44.774,00:24:46.193,I'm not. I just wanna talk.
00:24:48.278,00:24:50.572,-Your family misses you. -Your family's gonna miss you.
00:24:51.156,00:24:53.074,What are we waiting for?! It's him!
00:24:53.158,00:24:55.660,He's the guy! Let's stomp his ass!
00:24:55.744,00:24:58.371,"That's very tough, Vogle. You sound like a real grown-up."
00:25:01.750,00:25:04.753,"You ain't gonna put me and my Rowdy Boys back in no cages, man."
00:25:04.836,00:25:07.923,I'm trying to save your lives. It's different this time.
00:25:18.433,00:25:19.517,-What? -Let her go.
00:25:19.601,00:25:21.102,Let her go now.
00:25:22.896,00:25:24.231,-We see you. -Don't think we don't.
00:25:24.314,00:25:27.442,-We're gonna get you. -Shut up! And back down now!
00:25:27.525,00:25:28.526,That's low.
00:25:30.487,00:25:32.322,Even for your kind of scum.
00:25:35.325,00:25:36.701,"Don't be scared, Drummer Girl."
00:25:37.410,00:25:39.871,We'll see you again. Let's go!
00:25:46.378,00:25:47.337,Martin!
00:25:48.171,00:25:49.339,Vogle!
00:25:50.632,00:25:52.175,God damn it!
00:25:52.968,00:25:54.719,-She bit me! -That's enough.
00:26:02.435,00:26:04.312,-Ow! -This is very bad.
00:26:08.149,00:26:10.777,God damn right. He was acting awfully funny.
00:26:10.860,00:26:12.779,Something's wrong. Something's very wrong.
00:26:17.242,00:26:19.869,What kind of thing is that to say? What's wrong with you?
00:26:19.953,00:26:22.122,I'm trying to stay positive here. Stay positive.
00:26:27.252,00:26:29.421,Why didn't they just kill us in our sleep and take the map?
00:26:29.504,00:26:32.424,I don't think they knew we had it. It was the machine they were after.
00:26:32.507,00:26:34.134,-Ow! -Hold still.
00:26:35.385,00:26:36.845,Why did they have to be pink?
00:26:36.928,00:26:38.596,Ask the cook. It's his jeep.
00:26:41.516,00:26:45.312,"For someone who constantly talks about what an asshole he is, you're a good friend."
00:26:46.688,00:26:48.440,What? No.
00:26:49.649,00:26:50.483,"No, Dirk."
00:26:50.984,00:26:52.319,I'm a terrible friend.
00:26:53.069,00:26:53.903,"You just, like..."
00:26:54.571,00:26:56.281,project that friend stuff onto me.
00:27:03.163,00:27:04.789,You know what I was thinking about?
00:27:05.749,00:27:07.459,When I was staring down that gun?
00:27:09.627,00:27:11.463,-Bullets? -Amanda.
00:27:12.797,00:27:15.467,"How if I die, there'll be no one to take care of her."
00:27:16.634,00:27:18.094,-You're a good brother. -No.
00:27:19.095,00:27:20.347,"No, I'm a shitty brother."
00:27:20.930,00:27:22.265,I'm a shitty person.
00:27:23.391,00:27:28.646,"I was thinking about how if I die right now, I'll never have the chance to make up for the stuff I've done to her."
00:27:29.981,00:27:30.815,Done to her?
00:27:32.692,00:27:38.281,"Todd, I think with both of you sharing the disease, you supporting her has-- I didn't have the disease."
00:27:42.577,00:27:44.329,I didn't have pararibulitis.
00:27:48.166,00:27:50.251,-What? Then-- -It ran in my family.
00:27:52.420,00:27:56.841,I lied and said I did so my parents would send me money and I wouldn't have to work.
00:27:57.926,00:28:03.306,But why? Why not just... get a job or-- I don't know.
00:28:08.061,00:28:10.480,I can't even remember the first time I lied about it.
00:28:12.816,00:28:14.818,I don't even relate to that person anymore.
00:28:19.948,00:28:20.782,I just...
00:28:26.246,00:28:27.080,I don't know.
00:28:40.510,00:28:41.344,So...
00:28:42.679,00:28:45.682,when Amanda really got sick with the disease that I was faking...
00:28:47.642,00:28:50.562,"I realized that she needed the cash more than me, so..."
00:28:52.939,00:28:53.982,I said I got better.
00:28:55.316,00:28:57.986,But... it was too late.
00:28:59.487,00:29:01.364,My parents had already run out of money.
00:29:03.825,00:29:08.246,But you support her. But-- -Maybe you-- -I couldn't.
00:29:08.747,00:29:11.541,She thinks I was cured of a disease that she actually has.
00:29:12.625,00:29:15.295,Do you know how many times she's told me that's what gets her through the day?
00:29:15.378,00:29:16.629,That's what gives her hope.
00:29:20.508,00:29:22.177,How could I take that away from her?
00:29:26.681,00:29:31.603,"So... there's your assistant, friend, whatever, Dirk."
00:29:33.104,00:29:35.857,I am and always have been a total and complete asshole.
00:29:48.661,00:29:50.830,-Where's the kitten? -Oh.
00:29:52.457,00:29:53.374,Shit.
00:29:55.752,00:29:57.253,"Kitten? Here, kitten."
00:29:57.337,00:29:58.171,Kitten!
00:30:04.969,00:30:05.804,Bart?
00:30:08.890,00:30:09.724,"Bart, wait!"
00:30:09.808,00:30:11.851,I'm sick of hanging around like a coconut.
00:30:11.935,00:30:13.102,You're slowing me down.
00:30:13.520,00:30:20.109,All this sleeping and eating stuff distracts you -from what you gotta get done. -Where you going? What are you doing?
00:30:20.193,00:30:22.111,-See? Here we go. -What are you doing?
00:30:22.195,00:30:24.864,-I'm gonna kill that guy. -That's Dirk Gently?
00:30:25.490,00:30:27.283,I don't know. Let's kill him and find out.
00:30:27.367,00:30:29.285,-Wait. What? -I thought we got over this.
00:30:29.369,00:30:35.500,This is not like Red and the bikers. You can't just kill some guy in broad daylight in the middle of a crowded street.
00:30:35.583,00:30:38.711,"It's what I do, Ken. It's all I do."
00:30:38.795,00:30:40.839,-It's the will of the universe. -I know.
00:30:41.381,00:30:44.342,"I know. Okay, but you don't wanna end up in jail, right?"
00:30:44.843,00:30:51.182,"I mean, how are you going to fulfill your mission to kill Dirk Gently -if you're locked up? -Maybe that's where Dirk Gently is."
00:30:54.435,00:30:55.478,You talk too much.
00:31:04.529,00:31:06.865,Hey! You! Dickhead!
00:31:07.574,00:31:09.492,Come over here. Come here.
00:31:15.748,00:31:18.960,"Listen to me. No more arguments, no more excuses."
00:31:19.043,00:31:21.963,"There is no stopping me, no even slowing me down."
00:31:22.046,00:31:26.009,"You touch me again, you get in my way again, I'm taking your head off."
00:31:31.347,00:31:32.390,I need pants.
00:32:14.891,00:32:15.892,"Run the plates, right?"
00:32:16.559,00:32:19.479,-Let's check it out first. -Whoa. What if they're in there?
00:32:19.562,00:32:21.522,"If they're in there, then they're in there."
00:32:26.945,00:32:29.489,This place has got all kinds of code violations.
00:32:30.365,00:32:31.199,You think?
00:32:33.743,00:32:37.038,-You ever seen graffiti like this? -This is some new kind of crazy.
00:32:37.789,00:32:40.375,"-What is this place, Zim? -Stay close. Keep quiet."
00:32:41.876,00:32:42.877,Yeah.
00:32:57.600,00:33:01.479,"-Oh, shit. Oh, that stinks. -Holy shit."
00:33:08.277,00:33:09.278,"Oh, my God."
00:33:15.535,00:33:17.996,"Thirty-five bodies. There's, like, 35 bodies."
00:33:18.579,00:33:21.499,I wanna see the captain stonewall this. This is headline news.
00:33:21.582,00:33:24.377,Still no bars. Gotta be all that electrical stuff causing interference.
00:33:24.460,00:33:29.674,"Well, go. Radio. Radio for some backup. Radio for the entire forensic team."
00:33:29.757,00:33:32.385,"God damn it, call the whole National Guard."
00:33:32.885,00:33:34.637,There is gonna be trouble.
00:33:36.431,00:33:38.307,"Yep, I can smell it."
00:33:38.808,00:33:43.146,"Zimmer, just don't-- Zim?"
00:33:48.192,00:33:51.070,"No, no, come on, buddy. Come on. Come on. Come on."
00:34:04.292,00:34:06.210,I told you to stay down!
00:34:09.338,00:34:10.423,Lydia.
00:34:15.803,00:34:16.637,"Zim, you with me?"
00:34:23.436,00:34:26.230,Get up. Come on. God damn it. Come on.
00:34:40.870,00:34:43.247,"Talk to me, buddy. Hospital's only ten minutes away."
00:34:43.831,00:34:44.707,You hear me?
00:34:51.089,00:34:53.508,"All right, all right, all right."
00:34:54.092,00:34:55.134,"No, no, no."
00:34:55.218,00:34:57.470,"No, no, no. We're gonna get you some help."
00:34:57.553,00:34:59.680,"We're gonna get you some help, okay?"
00:35:00.640,00:35:02.683,"Don't do it, man. Don't-- Save..."
00:35:03.810,00:35:04.644,Save...
00:35:05.478,00:35:08.481,"-Zim, please. -Save Lydia Spring."
00:35:13.152,00:35:13.986,No.
00:35:19.534,00:35:20.743,"Oh, God."
00:35:22.954,00:35:24.497,"Shit, shit."
00:35:30.336,00:35:31.170,Psst!
00:35:35.299,00:35:37.260,It's pointless. She's long gone by now.
00:35:43.349,00:35:45.351,Have you ever felt directionless?
00:35:47.103,00:35:48.938,Like you didn't know what to do next?
00:35:50.273,00:35:53.526,I thought that was your thing. Everything's connected.
00:35:54.360,00:35:55.319,It is.
00:35:57.113,00:35:58.531,Everything is connected.
00:36:01.868,00:36:03.411,But only I can see it.
00:36:07.874,00:36:11.961,"I'm not psychic, but I am... something."
00:36:15.214,00:36:18.176,"When I was young, I would get intuitions about things."
00:36:19.594,00:36:23.306,"Little hunches about the way the universe works, but they never..."
00:36:25.099,00:36:26.976,It was like reading in another language.
00:36:27.059,00:36:29.437,Like signs with symbols I didn't understand.
00:36:29.520,00:36:35.443,"Well, then, why don't you, you know, use it to keep yourself safe or-- Because that's not how it works."
00:36:36.277,00:36:39.280,The hunches don't help me. Ever.
00:36:40.865,00:36:44.118,"So, I figured I might as well use them to try to help other people."
00:36:45.953,00:36:49.457,You're the first person who's actually stuck around and helped.
00:36:50.791,00:36:54.921,"You're the first person who's acted like a friend, whether you acknowledge it or not."
00:36:55.463,00:36:57.882,And to be totally candid...
00:36:59.050,00:37:02.094,"-I'm a bit sick of your bullshit, Todd. -What?"
00:37:02.178,00:37:05.056,"Well, I just wish you'd stop saying you're an asshole."
00:37:05.932,00:37:09.101,"I don't think you are, so it comes off a bit cheap."
00:37:09.185,00:37:11.270,Cheap? Have you not been listening?
00:37:11.354,00:37:19.153,"It's very easy to act like a jerk and then say, Well, I'm a jerk, so that's that, but it's not like being a bloody werewolf, is it?"
00:37:20.071,00:37:22.740,It's just you making excuses for your excuses.
00:37:23.324,00:37:24.450,I don't have any friends.
00:37:25.117,00:37:31.040,"I am always surrounded by bizarre and frightening states of disaster, and I am always alone."
00:37:31.791,00:37:33.793,Even you keep saying you're not my friend.
00:37:35.503,00:37:41.926,"But since you're the closest thing I've had, I'd really appreciate it if you'd stop calling yourself an asshole."
00:37:46.055,00:37:46.889,Okay.
00:37:49.225,00:37:50.309,You're right.
00:37:50.977,00:37:51.852,Huh?
00:37:52.728,00:37:58.818,"When we get back in the morning, we'll solve the murder of Patrick Spring, save Lydia and figure out whatever the hell that thing is."
00:38:00.987,00:38:03.948,And... I'll tell Amanda the truth...
00:38:05.324,00:38:06.158,about everything.
00:38:10.997,00:38:11.831,"And, Dirk..."
00:38:14.792,00:38:15.918,I am your friend.
00:38:27.388,00:38:28.931,Why do you have a knife?
00:38:29.515,00:38:30.891,-Okay. -Dude.
00:38:32.143,00:38:33.602,I am so happy to see you.
00:38:36.314,00:38:37.481,Are you okay?
00:38:37.565,00:38:39.817,No. Shit's crazy.
00:38:40.318,00:38:41.736,I'll tell you what you wanna know.
00:38:41.819,00:38:45.239,Excellent. Yes. Okay. That's good.
00:38:45.614,00:38:46.824,Okay. Perfect.
00:38:46.907,00:38:48.034,Um...
00:38:48.117,00:38:51.495,"Spectacular. Uh, just so you're aware..."
00:38:52.330,00:38:54.040,everything is under control.
00:38:54.915,00:38:57.126,Everything is under-- Are you okay?
00:38:57.209,00:39:02.590,"Yeah. Listen, did you talk to your brother or, um... Dirk?"
00:39:03.174,00:39:04.675,No. What's going on?
00:39:06.635,00:39:08.137,I just saw Lydia Spring.
00:39:15.519,00:39:19.273,"I read your report, but I wanted a more personal account."
00:39:21.567,00:39:24.278,"Shouldn't you be asking my superior officer, ma'am?"
00:39:24.362,00:39:25.905,"I'm asking you, corporal."
00:39:27.323,00:39:31.202,"I am ultimately in charge of this operation, but I wanted to ask your opinion."
00:39:31.827,00:39:37.208,"My understanding of the mission is that we're to bring in the subjects of Black Wing, ma'am."
00:39:37.875,00:39:38.709,Correct.
00:39:40.628,00:39:42.546,We tried Project Icarus first.
00:39:43.672,00:39:44.507,Dirk Gently.
00:39:45.966,00:39:46.884,And?
00:39:50.763,00:39:52.181,Didn't want to.
00:39:52.264,00:39:54.683,That's right. Didn't wanna be brought in.
00:39:54.767,00:39:58.396,"Something about a rough childhood, ma'am."
00:39:58.479,00:40:04.443,"I suggested a more aggressive approach, but Colonel Riggins rejected it."
00:40:04.527,00:40:05.361,I see.
00:40:06.445,00:40:09.448,"So, you next moved on to Project Incubus."
00:40:09.532,00:40:13.119,"That's right, but we were met with strong hostile response."
00:40:13.202,00:40:14.578,Colonel Riggins's choice to...
00:40:15.496,00:40:21.919,"confront them without backup-- I suggested a more traditional means of attack, but..."
00:40:22.503,00:40:25.172,"that was vetoed by the colonel, ma'am."
00:40:27.800,00:40:30.845,"So, your strategy would have been to..."
00:40:33.097,00:40:35.057,use a more aggressive approach?
00:40:36.892,00:40:37.810,"Yes, ma'am."
00:40:40.312,00:40:43.190,Truth is... Colonel Riggins is too close.
00:40:43.816,00:40:48.320,"He's emotionally involved, and it's blinding him from the realities of the situation."
00:40:49.321,00:40:53.367,There's a reason why the Neanderthals fell to the Homo Erectus.
00:40:56.203,00:40:59.874,Do you think you are capable of being more aggressive?
00:41:01.083,00:41:01.917,"Yes, ma'am."
00:41:02.668,00:41:03.836,Very erectus.
00:41:06.755,00:41:08.591,Much more aggressive.
00:03:18.114,00:03:19.073,I don't understand.
00:03:25.330,00:03:26.915,We have to wait.
00:03:34.047,00:03:36.132,"We get a SWAT team, a tank, go back there now."
00:03:36.216,00:03:38.509,-You broke into a facility-- -We didn't break in.
00:03:38.593,00:03:41.471,You broke into a facility without a warrant.
00:03:41.554,00:03:44.849,I can't in good conscience-- -Zimmerfield is dead. -I know.
00:03:45.600,00:03:47.310,-And I'm sorry. -We're going back now.
00:03:47.393,00:03:48.519,"-No, we're not. -We are."
00:03:53.399,00:03:58.905,All we have at this point is a dead cop as a result of an unlawful B and E.
00:04:01.783,00:04:03.034,With a harpoon.
00:04:07.455,00:04:11.292,We can't just start a gunfight in the middle of the Seattle Zoo.
00:04:21.261,00:04:22.136,You're in on this.
00:04:23.638,00:04:25.932,-What? -No follow-up on Patrick Spring...
00:04:27.350,00:04:28.518,now you got a dead cop.
00:04:29.602,00:04:31.479,And you're saying we gotta do this by the book?
00:04:32.480,00:04:33.439,"Yeah, you're in on this."
00:04:34.899,00:04:37.277,Say it. Say it to my face.
00:04:38.111,00:04:39.112,"Say, I'm in on this."
00:04:40.280,00:04:44.367,"Estevez, you are saying things you're going to regret."
00:04:50.039,00:04:51.499,-Them? -Yes. Them.
00:04:52.166,00:04:54.544,The Patrick Spring them. Those bald freaks them.
00:04:54.627,00:05:00.049,"The coroner, the Gordon Rimmer and whatever the hell else is locked up in that damn animal transfer unit them."
00:05:00.133,00:05:01.050,Them!
00:05:01.968,00:05:02.885,You're suspended.
00:05:04.053,00:05:05.680,-Say it. -You're fired.
00:05:05.763,00:05:07.140,Say it.
00:05:10.059,00:05:12.603,"-Bradshaw, come and escort Estevez-- -No, no, no."
00:05:14.647,00:05:15.648,Say it.
00:05:16.691,00:05:18.651,I'm right here. Just you and me. All right.
00:05:18.735,00:05:20.028,Just say it. Say it.
00:05:23.031,00:05:23.906,A cop is dead.
00:05:25.366,00:05:26.659,Zimmerfield is dead...
00:05:27.410,00:05:28.661,and he's firing me.
00:05:32.123,00:05:32.957,It's not over.
00:05:35.043,00:05:36.252,Not by a long shot.
00:05:48.723,00:05:50.099,"Rimmer, we have a problem."
00:05:57.357,00:05:58.775,"Okay, I'll get Farah."
00:05:59.192,00:06:03.112,"No. I'll go with Farah, you stay and talk to Amanda."
00:06:04.655,00:06:06.824,"-Now? -Everything is connected, Todd."
00:06:06.908,00:06:09.410,Telling Amanda the truth is your next step.
00:06:10.828,00:06:13.331,"Is this, you know, a universe thing?"
00:06:13.414,00:06:16.292,"Like if I don't do this now, the universe goes all weird?"
00:06:16.876,00:06:18.503,"The universe is already weird, Todd."
00:06:18.628,00:06:23.007,If you don't tell her now and we get killed later...
00:06:28.346,00:06:30.181,"Oh, and you should bring Amanda."
00:06:35.144,00:06:36.604,-You're back. Thank God. -Farah.
00:06:36.687,00:06:38.689,-Hey. We got the machine. -I killed someone.
00:06:38.773,00:06:41.067,"It's okay. We killed some people, too. Wait, what?"
00:06:41.150,00:06:43.361,You what? Is Amanda okay?
00:06:45.279,00:06:47.740,Have you ever done anything like that before?
00:06:47.824,00:06:52.203,"No. A lot of training, but-- Wait. What machine?"
00:06:52.286,00:06:54.539,We found Edgar Spring's unlimited energy device.
00:06:54.622,00:06:57.458,-We think. Who did you kill? -It's more of those bald freaks.
00:06:57.542,00:06:59.794,I found their hideout. They attacked the police.
00:06:59.877,00:07:01.462,They killed that detective.
00:07:02.338,00:07:04.507,-Estevez or Zimmerfield? -Zimmerfield.
00:07:04.590,00:07:06.551,"-Jesus, this is out of control. -Wait."
00:07:06.634,00:07:07.760,Wait. Who did you kill?
00:07:07.844,00:07:10.680,Same guys. They must have tracked us out to the reservation.
00:07:10.763,00:07:12.098,We got them with the kitten.
00:07:12.181,00:07:14.517,-The what? -The kitten. It had a shark in it.
00:07:14.600,00:07:21.649,"-Okay. -And, just putting this out there, just a theory at this point, but we think the dog has Lydia Spring in it."
00:07:22.275,00:07:30.158,-What? -We think Rimmer swapped the soul of the dog and Lydia to use as insurance in case Patrick tried to screw him in the exchange for the machine.
00:07:38.833,00:07:39.750,Yes.
00:07:40.334,00:07:43.671,"But we can put her back in her body, right?"
00:07:43.754,00:07:45.298,Dirk can do a... thing.
00:07:45.381,00:07:51.053,"Well, if we get the dog and Lydia and whatever they used to swap the soul, then, yes, we're..."
00:07:51.637,00:07:52.930,We're optimistic about that.
00:07:53.848,00:07:54.682,Okay.
00:07:55.766,00:07:59.770,Amanda said she was approached by men who seemed military.
00:07:59.854,00:08:00.897,"Shit, that's Black Wing."
00:08:00.980,00:08:04.066,-What? -A defunct CIA program that's after Dirk.
00:08:04.150,00:08:06.235,There's a tremendous amount of moving pieces.
00:08:09.822,00:08:11.491,You get Dirk to the Spring mansion.
00:08:11.574,00:08:14.911,I'll get Amanda and meet you there. I have something I have to do first.
00:08:16.954,00:08:18.915,He's not good at cars.
00:08:18.998,00:08:20.625,Yes. Take my SUV.
00:08:21.584,00:08:22.960,"Farah, thank you."
00:08:33.095,00:08:33.930,"Thanks, Todd."
00:08:37.517,00:08:39.727,-Always. Are you? -What? No.
00:08:40.436,00:08:45.608,"-Um, wait. What are you-- -Don't let anyone see you have this until you punch them in the face with it."
00:08:46.108,00:08:49.028,"-Right. -I'd give you my gun, but then I wouldn't have one."
00:08:49.362,00:08:51.447,-That can never happen. -Right.
00:08:56.827,00:08:57.662,Amanda?
00:09:00.081,00:09:00.915,Are you here?
00:09:17.682,00:09:20.643,"Dude, shit has been going down."
00:09:22.019,00:09:24.772,Where were you? What did you find out there with the map?
00:09:26.023,00:09:28.818,-Hey. We... -Farah is super weird.
00:09:37.118,00:09:42.456,"-We have to-- -Not that she's not great, -but I don't even know where to start. -I never had pararibulitis."
00:09:42.540,00:09:44.333,The last 24 hours was just like...
00:09:46.419,00:09:47.336,What?
00:09:50.381,00:09:53.551,I just-- I-- I couldn't keep it a secret anymore.
00:09:54.969,00:09:56.178,What did you say?
00:09:58.514,00:10:00.141,I never had pararibulitis.
00:10:06.105,00:10:08.774,"Yes, you did. What are you-- What are you talking about?"
00:10:08.858,00:10:12.278,"Yes, you did. That's, like, why you dropped out of college."
00:10:12.361,00:10:16.532,"No, I dropped out because I was failing, I never went to classes."
00:10:16.616,00:10:18.826,I was trying to dedicate my time to the Mexican Funeral.
00:10:20.661,00:10:23.664,"Look, this isn't how I meant for this to happen, okay?"
00:10:23.748,00:10:26.792,"I've wanted to tell you for years, but-- That doesn't make sense."
00:10:31.380,00:10:36.010,The Mexican Funeral broke up because I sold our equipment and told the guys that it was stolen.
00:10:39.430,00:10:40.264,Okay.
00:10:41.390,00:10:52.526,"But, okay, there was that time with Mom and Dad when you were, like-- Well, I wanted my own apartment, and I needed first and last month's rent, and the money Mom and Dad were sending for what they thought was my treatments wasn't enough."
00:11:00.201,00:11:01.535,You told me that.
00:11:02.870,00:11:07.833,"Yes. I told you that, and I told them that my parents hated them."
00:11:07.917,00:11:16.467,"When you're lying, you lie to both sides so that the others don't talk to each other, and I ended up trapped under so many 'cause it snowballed."
00:11:16.550,00:11:18.177,It snowballed?
00:11:18.260,00:11:19.387,I was being stupid.
00:11:19.470,00:11:20.763,You're not like that.
00:11:20.846,00:11:22.223,-You wouldn't do that... -No.
00:11:22.306,00:11:24.225,"-and you are not like that. -No, I'm not."
00:11:24.725,00:11:27.353,I-- I changed. I changed the second you got sick.
00:11:27.436,00:11:33.692,"It made me realize that I-- Well, it doesn't matter now. Okay?"
00:11:33.776,00:11:35.903,Because-- because look.
00:11:37.947,00:11:38.781,Seriously?
00:11:38.864,00:11:40.199,"It's $10,000."
00:11:43.536,00:11:45.037,You're trying to bribe me?
00:11:45.121,00:11:48.874,"No. I-- Look, we can talk about this later."
00:11:49.792,00:11:50.793,This isn't happening.
00:11:51.377,00:11:52.378,"Oh, this was stupid."
00:11:52.461,00:11:54.046,-Yes. Uh-huh. -This was so stupid of me.
00:11:54.130,00:11:56.215,"-Okay, we have to leave now. -Is that a joke?"
00:11:56.298,00:11:59.135,"-No, we have to go-- -No, wait! Oh, what are you saying to me?"
00:11:59.301,00:12:00.761,-What are you even saying? -Amanda.
00:12:03.556,00:12:04.640,This isn't happening.
00:12:05.808,00:12:09.645,"I'm sorry, Todd, but this is not happening."
00:12:09.728,00:12:12.106,-Wait. -Not happening.
00:12:12.189,00:12:29.457,No. Amanda-- -What are you doing? -Spot checks.
00:12:29.540,00:12:31.876,Whoever was following you could be watching us now.
00:12:31.959,00:12:33.252,Spot checks. Fantastic.
00:12:34.253,00:12:37.339,I think of you and me as Module B of the detective agency.
00:12:37.923,00:12:43.637,"Todd and I being Module A, the investigative arm, but you and I, we're the strike team for when things get physical."
00:12:44.638,00:12:48.934,You can't be in both -Module A and Module B. -Sure I can. I jump across.
00:12:54.482,00:12:58.944,What you'd wanna do is use the MECE methodology to divide the teams.
00:12:59.028,00:13:00.863,The MECE? What?
00:13:00.946,00:13:04.325,"Mutually exclusive, cumulatively exhaustive sub-units."
00:13:04.867,00:13:12.666,And then establish configurations wherein every possible dynamic is addressed to the skill set of the people therein. That would be more efficient.
00:13:16.629,00:13:19.715,I'm not part of your detective agency.
00:13:19.798,00:13:21.634,"-I'm-- -Aren't you, though? A little bit?"
00:13:21.717,00:13:22.760,What else have you got?
00:13:22.843,00:13:25.679,I mainly attract people in positions of absolute hopelessness.
00:13:25.763,00:13:27.139,You fit into that quite nicely.
00:13:29.225,00:13:30.601,-No offense. -Just...
00:13:31.810,00:13:32.645,be quiet.
00:13:35.397,00:13:38.859,"But it's kind of incredible, isn't it? I mean, how close we are now."
00:13:38.943,00:13:40.694,It feels like we're onto something.
00:13:40.778,00:13:41.612,We'll see.
00:13:43.322,00:13:45.783,Did I only make mistakes? Yes.
00:13:45.866,00:13:47.243,But did it all work out?
00:13:47.326,00:13:48.327,Kind of.
00:13:48.410,00:13:52.957,"I had a plan, and I put it into action, and it went off flawlessly."
00:13:53.040,00:13:54.458,Almost. Mostly.
00:13:54.875,00:13:58.212,"Maybe it went off flawful-ish, but not a total disaster."
00:14:04.385,00:14:07.096,That's what we'll put on the sign for the detective agency.
00:14:07.179,00:14:09.682,Cases solved with arguable efficiency.
00:14:10.933,00:14:14.520,Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency.
00:14:14.895,00:14:16.814,"Dirk Gently, here to help."
00:14:17.398,00:14:18.482,"You hear that, everyone?"
00:14:18.649,00:14:19.650,Dirk Gently!
00:14:20.192,00:14:22.444,"Me, Dirk Gently! That's what the sign will say."
00:14:22.987,00:14:24.238,I am Dirk Gently!
00:14:24.321,00:14:26.615,"-I am Dirk Gently! -Dirk, get down."
00:14:32.037,00:14:33.247,No! Down! Bad!
00:14:41.547,00:14:43.382,Get out of the way. Damn it.
00:15:26.800,00:15:28.761,Drop your weapon! Drop it now!
00:15:45.444,00:15:47.655,-Stop running! -Not much choice.
00:15:48.238,00:15:51.617,"No, no! No, please! Please. I don't know why you're doing this."
00:15:51.700,00:15:54.411,You're supposed to die. I'm supposed to kill you.
00:15:54.787,00:15:56.205,Everything led me here.
00:15:56.705,00:15:58.290,"To you, to this."
00:15:58.374,00:16:00.167,-Everything is connected. -Everything is connected.
00:16:04.505,00:16:05.339,That's...
00:16:06.048,00:16:06.882,different.
00:16:15.808,00:16:17.935,-You're one of the others. -You're one of the others.
00:16:19.103,00:16:20.604,-You're like me. -You're like me.
00:16:22.648,00:16:24.483,-You're not like me. -You're not like me.
00:16:25.776,00:16:27.194,-You're something different. -You're something different.
00:17:04.523,00:17:05.357,God!
00:17:07.860,00:17:10.029,I can't get hurt. It isn't possible.
00:17:10.112,00:17:11.613,You've never been hurt before?
00:17:13.615,00:17:15.826,"Cops are coming, and we need to find a way out."
00:17:18.203,00:17:22.833,"If we could just get to the service level, maybe we could get out the back."
00:17:22.916,00:17:24.084,I'll never walk again.
00:17:24.168,00:17:27.296,"And of course that's locked, for employees only."
00:17:27.379,00:17:28.964,And I have no tools.
00:17:33.886,00:17:35.137,You saved me.
00:17:35.721,00:17:37.765,No wonder Spring entrusted his safety to you.
00:17:37.848,00:17:39.725,You are an incredible person.
00:17:40.517,00:17:41.435,Who'd have thought?
00:17:42.311,00:17:44.813,"-All part of the job. -No, it absolutely wasn't."
00:17:44.897,00:17:48.150,Unless you're talking about your job at my detective agency.
00:17:48.233,00:17:49.401,-Aah! -What?!
00:17:49.485,00:17:51.779,The machine. I left it in the car.
00:17:51.862,00:17:55.032,Stupid Dirk! Always running away from death and forgetting machines!
00:17:57.701,00:17:58.535,I got it.
00:17:59.703,00:18:00.996,I got it!
00:18:01.080,00:18:02.664,I got it. We're moving again.
00:18:02.748,00:18:04.500,-I messed up. -What?
00:18:05.292,00:18:07.628,-I ruined everything. -What are you talking about?
00:18:09.254,00:18:11.799,I left my path and this is my punishment.
00:18:13.175,00:18:14.093,We're lost?
00:18:17.262,00:18:18.472,Universe is broken.
00:18:23.685,00:18:25.020,"Oh, thank God."
00:18:26.230,00:18:28.357,We have to get this to the Spring mansion.
00:18:28.440,00:18:30.734,The FBI guy was right. We can't do this alone.
00:18:47.042,00:18:49.962,You were right. I need your help.
00:18:50.754,00:18:53.298,Don't worry. I'm on my way.
00:19:04.059,00:19:04.893,I have a theory.
00:19:07.980,00:19:14.111,"I have a theory, and I don't like it at all, but it's-- It's my theory right now. It's all I got."
00:19:15.571,00:19:16.405,"So, uh..."
00:19:18.615,00:19:20.242,I'm gonna explain it to you and...
00:19:31.503,00:19:34.173,right now I feel like I'm losing my mind a little. Like...
00:19:35.674,00:19:36.508,Like I might...
00:19:41.013,00:19:41.847,You know?
00:19:44.224,00:19:45.058,"So, I just..."
00:19:48.687,00:19:53.233,"Man, I need you to confirm or deny one-- One question."
00:20:01.700,00:20:02.910,Are you Lydia Spring?
00:20:07.122,00:20:12.461,And I lost someone who I-- who I-- I lost someone who means a lot to me.
00:20:15.422,00:20:21.470,I'm not-- Bark twice for yes. Are you Lydia Spring?
00:20:31.355,00:20:34.274,"If you're Lydia Spring, bark three times and turn in a circle."
00:20:48.538,00:20:50.415,How did this happen to you? Huh?
00:20:53.710,00:20:56.380,How'd you get away? Did someone take you?
00:21:07.724,00:21:08.725,Let's go talk to them.
00:21:21.947,00:21:22.823,These guys suck.
00:21:25.492,00:21:27.286,I said these guys suck.
00:21:37.963,00:21:39.089,-You just grabbed my ass. -What?
00:21:39.172,00:21:40.882,-You just grabbed my ass. -I'm Rick.
00:21:42.592,00:21:44.511,-What the hell? -That's my boyfriend.
00:21:44.594,00:21:46.638,"He just grabbed my ass, you stupid bitch."
00:21:46.722,00:21:48.223,He can do whatever he wants.
00:21:48.307,00:21:49.182,Do you wanna go?
00:21:52.436,00:21:55.772,"-Get off me. -Both of you, out of here, now!"
00:22:01.278,00:22:03.322,I'm sorry I screwed up your night.
00:22:05.282,00:22:07.492,"No, it's okay. That guy was an asshole."
00:22:07.576,00:22:15.959,"I know you never go out anymore because of the disease, and now I'm all covered in beer, -and I'm crying like a pussy and-- -Hey."
00:22:21.590,00:22:23.300,"-I love you. -I love you, too."
00:22:36.313,00:22:37.314,Are you ready to talk?
00:22:38.940,00:22:40.108,I'm sorry.
00:22:41.068,00:22:43.278,Is this very inconvenient for you?
00:22:44.571,00:22:45.655,I'm processing.
00:22:47.157,00:22:54.372,I just-- -I should have waited. -You should've waited?
00:22:55.165,00:22:56.041,"Yeah, you're right."
00:22:56.792,00:22:58.710,Six years wasn't quite long enough.
00:23:00.670,00:23:04.674,"Great prank, Todd, but you screwed up the timing."
00:23:05.801,00:23:07.260,That's what you screwed up.
00:23:09.429,00:23:10.806,Put your phone under the door.
00:23:11.723,00:23:12.557,What?
00:23:13.225,00:23:14.351,I'm calling Mom and Dad.
00:23:19.981,00:23:20.941,Okay. Okay.
00:23:21.024,00:23:29.491,"But, Amanda, we have to go meet Dirk and Farah, and we can't stay here anymore. There are dangerous people-- Yeah. I know. I met some of them."
00:23:32.160,00:23:34.955,"Look, you're the most important person in the world to me."
00:23:35.455,00:23:36.915,What are you even saying?
00:23:38.125,00:23:39.334,I don't know you.
00:23:39.417,00:23:42.129,I literally don't know who you are.
00:23:43.547,00:23:44.798,You are not my brother.
00:23:46.174,00:23:49.970,You are... some other person.
00:23:50.095,00:23:51.930,"No, I-- I am you brother."
00:23:56.977,00:23:59.521,Give me the goddamn phone. Right now.
00:24:05.861,00:24:06.695,"Oh, shit."
00:24:11.116,00:24:11.950,"Oh, my God."
00:24:12.617,00:24:13.660,You recognize this dog?
00:24:15.537,00:24:16.580,-Huh? -Yes.
00:24:17.372,00:24:21.918,"The dog you stole from Gordon Rimmer, right before you burned down his house."
00:24:22.002,00:24:23.712,"-Right? -That's what happened, yes."
00:24:26.256,00:24:28.592,I'd have thought you'd have cleaned this up by now.
00:24:29.217,00:24:36.183,"You know, the CIA, the actual goddamn CIA told us not to follow up on those four guys in the van who trashed it. Crazy."
00:24:38.560,00:24:41.938,-Have you been drinking? -Have you been drinking?
00:24:42.522,00:24:46.401,"Okay, that dog is the most important thing here."
00:24:48.111,00:24:49.154,Because it's Lydia Spring.
00:24:50.113,00:24:52.908,-Yes. -How'd they turn her into a dog?
00:24:55.118,00:24:58.663,They didn't. They took the soul out of her body and swapped it with a dog.
00:24:59.372,00:25:00.457,-Her body? -Yeah.
00:25:00.540,00:25:01.833,She's-- She's still alive.
00:25:01.917,00:25:03.251,"So, you know where she is?"
00:25:03.335,00:25:04.169,I...
00:25:08.131,00:25:11.551,-Your friends killed my partner. -They are not my friends.
00:25:11.635,00:25:17.849,"-Oh, so you know about that, too, huh? -No. I-- Where is Lydia Spring?"
00:25:28.527,00:25:29.694,Let me open that door.
00:25:29.778,00:25:30.946,You don't have a warrant.
00:25:31.029,00:25:32.072,"I have a gun, Todd."
00:25:33.323,00:25:34.366,I have a gun.
00:25:38.536,00:25:41.039,You-- You seem a little stressed.
00:25:41.122,00:25:42.541,I'm just gonna say-- oh!
00:25:43.083,00:25:45.669,Stay! I will not let this get ahead of me again.
00:25:45.752,00:25:47.796,-Understand me? -You have to open that door!
00:25:47.879,00:25:49.422,-Shut up! -My sister's in there.
00:25:50.048,00:25:51.341,Come out with your hands up!
00:25:51.424,00:25:52.259,-Please-- -Shut up!
00:25:52.342,00:25:53.301,She has a disease.
00:25:53.385,00:25:54.344,Shut up!
00:26:05.564,00:26:09.442,"Okay, okay. All right. Come on. Why's she choking? Huh?"
00:26:10.068,00:26:13.405,-What's wrong with her? -She's not choking. She's drowning.
00:26:19.077,00:26:28.336,"There isn't time. She keeps breathing like this, Holy shit. Jesus. Not now."
00:26:28.878,00:26:29.879,You're coming with us.
00:26:40.598,00:26:41.641,I'm all revved up!
00:26:42.726,00:26:43.852,"Ed, are we in trouble?"
00:26:51.860,00:26:52.736,"Hey, hey!"
00:27:04.164,00:27:05.373,"Hey, how you doing?"
00:27:09.002,00:27:11.630,-Take that. -I got him!
00:27:36.988,00:27:38.406,"Oh, Amanda. Thank God."
00:27:39.074,00:27:40.283,Don't touch me!
00:27:40.825,00:27:41.910,Amanda.
00:27:42.994,00:27:43.828,No.
00:27:44.371,00:27:46.331,You brought me here to keep me safe?
00:27:47.040,00:27:47.874,Here.
00:27:48.500,00:27:50.293,Into this. With you.
00:27:51.711,00:27:53.838,You don't care about me at all.
00:27:58.093,00:28:01.930,"Okay, just-- Look, I was gonna fix things."
00:28:02.013,00:28:03.390,I was gonna fix everything.
00:28:06.893,00:28:08.770,Everything about you is a lie.
00:28:10.188,00:28:11.606,I don't want your help.
00:28:11.689,00:28:15.068,And I-- I don't wanna ever see you again.
00:28:17.654,00:28:19.030,You are exactly...
00:28:19.906,00:28:21.908,the piece of shit that everyone thinks you are.
00:28:29.666,00:28:30.542,Get me out of here.
00:28:32.752,00:28:35.797,No. Wait. Amanda. You can't leave.
00:28:36.673,00:28:37.924,"Amanda, stop!"
00:28:38.508,00:28:39.718,"No, you can't go with them."
00:28:42.887,00:28:43.888,Don't be sad.
00:28:47.475,00:28:50.979,"Traffic conditions, transporting the machine, accosted by a..."
00:28:51.479,00:28:56.609,"So, you're saying you have no idea who that was."
00:28:56.693,00:28:59.779,"Again, I can't clarify this enough, I haven't the slightest clue."
00:28:59.863,00:29:04.409,That homicidal dirt muppet and I have never crossed paths before.
00:29:04.492,00:29:06.161,Could she be with the cult?
00:29:06.244,00:29:07.412,"Well, I think not."
00:29:08.788,00:29:12.959,"I did think we had-- We had a bit of a moment, though."
00:29:17.964,00:29:20.842,"Look, I-- I don't like this. And Todd should be here by now."
00:29:20.925,00:29:24.012,He'll be here. He wanted to talk to Amanda about some things.
00:29:26.222,00:29:28.933,Do you like Todd?
00:29:29.517,00:29:31.186,"-Yeah, he's fine. -Is he?"
00:29:34.022,00:29:35.106,He's brave.
00:29:36.065,00:29:38.651,In his own unique way.
00:29:44.240,00:29:46.493,He's not much of a phone answerer in my experience.
00:29:48.787,00:29:51.581,"Once we plug in the machine, everything will become clear."
00:29:51.664,00:29:55.376,"-You don't even know what it does. -Well, I mean, clearly it..."
00:29:56.920,00:29:58.671,clarifies everything.
00:29:59.547,00:30:00.423,Show me.
00:30:16.981,00:30:19.192,Oh. Does it do that?
00:30:20.068,00:30:21.569,We didn't see that one.
00:30:21.653,00:30:22.570,These are dates.
00:30:22.654,00:30:25.657,This is the date Patrick was killed and this...
00:30:26.241,00:30:27.784,this is when his wife was killed.
00:30:29.202,00:30:30.370,What is this thing?
00:30:36.459,00:30:37.293,What?
00:30:45.677,00:30:47.345,You said you were bringing backup.
00:30:48.221,00:30:52.225,It's hard to get a SWAT team together based on one phone call.
00:30:53.184,00:30:54.978,"Smart move to call me, though."
00:30:55.061,00:30:56.771,You're the FBI man?
00:30:56.855,00:30:59.691,"Yes, that's right. And you're Dirk Gently."
00:30:59.774,00:31:00.817,It's me.
00:31:00.900,00:31:03.528,Good to finally meet you. You said you were attacked.
00:31:03.611,00:31:05.405,Yes. So many times.
00:31:05.488,00:31:11.035,"There's a group of people, some kind of cult or secret organization, hunting us."
00:31:11.119,00:31:14.455,"They said they didn't kill Patrick, but they have Lydia."
00:31:15.039,00:31:19.836,-They're a key piece in what's happening. -Two came after us while we were trying to dig up the machine.
00:31:19.919,00:31:21.004,-Got them both. -Yeah.
00:31:22.046,00:31:24.549,"-You killed them? -Well, the shark did, certainly."
00:31:27.802,00:31:29.637,"-This machine, where is it? -Here."
00:31:31.264,00:31:34.517,"We put it together ourselves, so some bits might be on backwards, but..."
00:31:41.316,00:31:44.652,This is it. This is... the machine.
00:31:45.236,00:31:48.031,"-That's right. -Excellent work, Miss Black."
00:31:49.782,00:31:50.617,Thank you.
00:31:51.534,00:31:53.286,Can I tell you a secret?
00:31:53.870,00:31:55.038,When we met...
00:31:57.540,00:31:59.292,you were right the first time.
00:32:01.294,00:32:02.962,You're going to have to come with me.
00:32:16.726,00:32:17.560,This is lunacy.
00:32:18.227,00:32:19.062,You must see that.
00:32:19.145,00:32:20.521,Cops showed up at the temple.
00:32:20.980,00:32:22.106,Had to kill one of them.
00:32:25.068,00:32:26.736,You lost your mind when you betrayed Rainey.
00:32:26.819,00:32:30.198,"The Supreme Soul had a plan for us, for all of us."
00:32:30.823,00:32:31.991,"Oh, really? Did he now?"
00:32:32.617,00:32:36.079,"Find more bodies, make new drones, make more money."
00:32:37.163,00:32:38.456,There's no ambition in that.
00:32:39.290,00:32:41.167,He got what he had coming to him.
00:32:41.751,00:32:42.627,That's heresy.
00:32:47.757,00:32:51.177,"You talk about it like it's real, like it's-- Like it's spiritual."
00:32:51.761,00:32:55.181,"After all these years, how do you still believe in that?"
00:32:55.264,00:32:58.893,The machine came to us from across time and space.
00:32:59.477,00:33:02.063,You were there. You're one of the original souls.
00:33:02.146,00:33:05.316,"Why is it, you think, that Rainey didn't let us build another altar?"
00:33:05.400,00:33:09.821,"Had us holed up in some rotted-out mansion basement, had us in some decrepit zoo building?"
00:33:09.904,00:33:12.407,-It's so he could control it. -The altar is sacred.
00:33:12.490,00:33:13.658,It's electrical!
00:33:14.659,00:33:17.203,The Soul Exchanger isn't some holy relic.
00:33:17.578,00:33:19.205,It's a piece of technology.
00:33:20.248,00:33:22.166,It always has been. It always will be.
00:33:22.250,00:33:23.292,You're insane.
00:33:24.585,00:33:29.507,Your drones are dropping like flies. Your insurgency is a failure.
00:33:29.590,00:33:31.718,You have ruined everything.
00:33:32.301,00:33:36.347,"The detective whose partner you killed, he's looking for you. He's not gonna go away."
00:33:36.431,00:33:37.974,I have the other machine.
00:33:43.354,00:33:46.024,"So, that means you follow me now."
00:33:46.816,00:33:53.072,"So, you are gonna go off and collect whoever you can, whoever hasn't run away. My men are bringing in relevant parties."
00:33:53.156,00:33:57.035,"I will have the machine tonight, have it at the temple, and you will meet me there."
00:33:59.912,00:34:02.790,I don't give a shit whether you believe in me or not.
00:34:04.000,00:34:06.544,But I am the Supreme Soul now.
00:34:14.469,00:34:15.595,Please be quiet.
00:34:16.095,00:34:17.013,Please?
00:34:17.680,00:34:19.223,You gotta stop screaming.
00:34:20.266,00:34:21.559,Can you stop screaming?
00:34:22.268,00:34:24.103,"Listen, you gotta stop screaming."
00:34:24.645,00:34:26.314,Can you stop screaming?
00:34:30.610,00:34:31.861,Okay.
00:34:31.944,00:34:33.154,...struck by a car today.
00:34:33.237,00:34:42.413,"While informing his next of kin, Two women who'd been trapped and kept prisoner in Gifford's basement for over three months."
00:34:43.498,00:34:45.041,I'm gonna kill that guy. Hey!
00:34:47.794,00:34:49.962,"Oh, God!"
00:34:51.631,00:34:58.137,-Get this thing out of my leg. -I read on the Internet that you're not-- I don't care what the stupid rectangle tells you to do!
00:34:58.221,00:34:59.931,"If I'm supposed to die, I will."
00:35:00.431,00:35:02.058,We're not gonna go to the hospital.
00:35:03.101,00:35:03.976,I give up.
00:35:04.811,00:35:06.270,Just do it. I give up.
00:35:06.354,00:35:09.232,"-What, you get hurt once and you give up? -I can't get hurt."
00:35:10.066,00:35:12.276,I'm always safe. I can't get hurt.
00:35:12.360,00:35:15.071,"A rollercoaster is safe, too, unless it goes off the track."
00:35:15.154,00:35:18.366,Gobbledygook. What do you even know about anything?
00:35:18.449,00:35:19.909,"You assumed too much, Bart."
00:35:20.785,00:35:22.954,You say you kill whoever you feel like killing.
00:35:23.538,00:35:25.498,Did you feel like killing Dirk Gently right then?
00:35:29.919,00:35:34.423,"And-- I mean, it was-- It was different, but..."
00:35:36.175,00:35:40.346,I knew I thought-- I thought that I knew that I was-- That's what I thought.
00:35:41.556,00:35:44.642,"You shoot up a mall, middle of the day, we just happen to get away?"
00:35:44.725,00:35:50.690,"I walk you into a crowded hotel, with a knife in your leg, and we just happen to not get noticed?"
00:35:51.732,00:35:52.567,It's the universe.
00:35:53.234,00:35:54.777,It's the stream of creation.
00:35:55.695,00:36:00.658,And I have been doing nothing every day of my life and thinking it was that.
00:36:02.034,00:36:02.869,Nothing.
00:36:03.286,00:36:04.162,It was nothing.
00:36:05.163,00:36:06.455,"Okay, but now I can see it."
00:36:07.039,00:36:10.835,"And I don't know what it is, and I can't name it, but I've seen it."
00:36:11.627,00:36:13.796,"Right, and that's greater than understanding."
00:36:13.880,00:36:15.089,"Okay, I believe."
00:36:16.299,00:36:18.384,"I believe in you, Bart."
00:36:19.093,00:36:22.180,You taught me a lot.
00:36:22.763,00:36:24.891,We're gonna get you out of this tub. All right?
00:36:24.974,00:36:29.645,We're gonna find you clothes without blood on them and get you a weapon.
00:36:29.729,00:36:34.317,"We're gonna get out there, follow the web of the universe so you can do what you're supposed to do."
00:36:35.234,00:36:36.485,Kill Dirk Gently.
00:36:37.570,00:36:38.696,Or something.
00:36:40.406,00:36:41.490,Okay. Okay.
00:36:42.825,00:36:43.659,But first...
00:37:03.804,00:37:04.847,Psst.
00:37:07.642,00:37:08.601,She's gone.
00:37:08.684,00:37:11.812,Gone? Like she is... gone?
00:37:11.896,00:37:14.523,She hasn't stopped existing. She's just gone.
00:37:15.733,00:37:18.069,Is this where the universe was supposed to lead us?
00:37:20.112,00:37:21.072,Maybe.
00:37:22.406,00:37:23.282,Who hit you?
00:37:23.866,00:37:24.700,A detective.
00:37:25.159,00:37:25.993,Estevez.
00:37:27.411,00:37:30.164,"He's, like, gone kind of crazy, I guess."
00:37:32.250,00:37:33.084,Where's Farah?
00:37:33.668,00:37:34.502,I don't know.
00:37:40.216,00:37:41.634,Are these guys gonna kill us?
00:37:42.885,00:37:43.719,I mean...
00:37:44.762,00:37:45.972,I should hope not.
00:37:49.850,00:37:50.851,This guy again.
00:37:51.644,00:37:52.937,This is it.
00:37:53.020,00:37:55.523,He'll explain everything. He's gonna have the answers.
00:38:10.288,00:38:12.915,Who are you guys? Did Patrick Spring hire you?
00:38:12.999,00:38:15.793,"If not, then what are you? Are you detectives?"
00:38:15.876,00:38:18.129,"No, because you're a-- you're a bellhop."
00:38:18.212,00:38:19.338,You were at the hotel.
00:38:19.422,00:38:21.382,"And you, you're who?"
00:38:21.465,00:38:25.261,"-What, the FBI? -No-- No? Then how does the FBI figure into this?"
00:38:26.846,00:38:29.598,How did you know Farah Black was gonna be in that apartment?
00:38:29.682,00:38:31.767,What kind of crazy coincidence is that?
00:38:31.851,00:38:36.314,-Where's the kitten? -The-- And where's my dog? Why did you burn down my house?
00:38:36.397,00:38:38.190,Who has my dog now? Is it the police?
00:38:38.274,00:38:39.567,Do the police have my dog?
00:38:39.650,00:38:41.193,Who beat up Ed and Zed?
00:38:41.277,00:38:43.529,Was it your guys? Other guys?
00:38:43.612,00:38:46.240,How many different sets of guys are in this situation?
00:38:46.324,00:38:49.827,How does Patrick Spring be in two places at the same time?
00:38:56.167,00:38:57.293,Nuts.
00:38:58.669,00:39:02.006,"We-- We don't-- Sorry, I guess."
00:39:02.089,00:39:05.634,"I, like, can answer four of those questions, total, if I'm being honest."
00:39:05.718,00:39:06.969,But you were there!
00:39:07.553,00:39:09.597,-Where? -At the hotel!
00:39:09.680,00:39:12.850,"When Patrick Spring died, you were both there together."
00:39:12.933,00:39:14.935,You were wearing my coat. This coat!
00:39:26.697,00:39:27.948,It's the same machine.
00:39:28.532,00:39:29.909,What? What? What?
00:39:29.992,00:39:31.118,Ooh!
00:39:31.202,00:39:32.578,"Todd, solved it."
00:39:32.661,00:39:33.496,The dates.
00:39:33.996,00:39:36.707,"Of course, so stupid, makes total sense in hindsight."
00:39:36.791,00:39:39.293,Amazed I didn't get it. We've got to go in there.
00:39:39.377,00:39:43.839,"-Stop, stop. -Edgar Spring, Zackariah Webb, Patrick Spring. The whole thing."
00:39:44.340,00:39:47.259,I can get us out of here. I solved the case.
00:39:47.343,00:39:51.639,"No, no, no. You stop talking to him, start talking to me, giving me answers."
00:39:51.722,00:39:59.647,"I want you two to give me some answers now. I-- No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:39:59.730,00:40:01.690,"Fred, get out there, find out what that is."
00:40:24.046,00:40:25.131,"Todd, run!"
00:40:30.302,00:40:31.846,"Dirk, what's the plan?"
00:40:31.929,00:40:35.266,There's a plug just like this in the basement of Patrick Spring's house.
00:40:35.349,00:40:37.435,And there was another one under the Ridgely.
00:40:37.518,00:40:39.603,"They're gonna come in here and kill us, Dirk."
00:40:39.687,00:40:41.147,"We won't be here, Todd."
00:40:41.939,00:40:42.982,"Come on, grab hold!"
00:40:45.484,00:40:53.451,"-I'm saving us! -How are you gonna save us -with an unlimited energy machine? -It's not an unlimited energy machine, and that's not the Soul Exchanger."
00:40:53.534,00:40:55.661,"Well, they both are, but they're not, too."
00:40:56.203,00:40:57.872,Come on! Grab tight!
00:41:00.040,00:41:03.335,"There's not going to be a murder, Todd. We're going to fix everything."
00:41:04.420,00:41:05.546,Watch this.
00:00:34.617,00:00:35.744,What happened?
00:00:36.619,00:00:39.122,Are we-- wait. Where are we?
00:00:40.081,00:00:41.666,Are we still here?
00:00:42.375,00:00:46.504,"For the moment, yes. But at the moment? No. We're in the past."
00:00:46.588,00:00:49.090,"If I'm correct, one week in the past."
00:00:49.174,00:00:52.552,The Unlimited Energy Device is a time machine? Did you know that?
00:00:52.635,00:00:57.724,"Kind of a hunch, really. But the good news is-- Never mind. There's no good news. Hide."
00:01:00.977,00:01:02.270,I don't have a lot of time here.
00:01:07.484,00:01:10.195,"All right, get the machine. Put it in. Put the dog there."
00:01:10.278,00:01:13.531,We're switching her into the dog and the dog into her. Tie her in.
00:01:15.575,00:01:17.410,"Okay, good. All right."
00:01:20.288,00:01:22.207,Strap her in tight. Get her tight.
00:01:22.290,00:01:25.585,"Tight there. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Careful. Careful with that."
00:01:29.297,00:01:31.716,"Look, sorry about this, Rapunzel. Sorry."
00:01:31.800,00:01:33.885,"Good, okay, now, take her helmet and back up."
00:01:35.345,00:01:36.471,Everybody back up!
00:01:41.142,00:01:42.310,"Three, two, one, go."
00:02:01.871,00:02:04.290,Stay back. Everybody stay back. Okay.
00:02:09.003,00:02:09.838,Good girl.
00:02:09.921,00:02:12.715,Aw. There's my girl.
00:02:13.299,00:02:14.300,Aw.
00:02:14.384,00:02:16.636,"Okay, let's take this-- okay, get the dog."
00:02:19.722,00:02:21.474,"Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait."
00:02:21.558,00:02:22.934,"Wait, wait, whoa, whoa."
00:02:23.017,00:02:25.395,"Whoa. No, no, whoa, whoa."
00:02:29.399,00:02:30.567,Sacrilege.
00:02:31.442,00:02:32.277,Treason.
00:02:33.736,00:02:34.654,Death.
00:02:34.737,00:02:38.116,"No one has to die here today, Rainey."
00:02:38.199,00:02:40.660,Do you know... who this is?
00:02:41.244,00:02:42.078,Do you?
00:02:42.620,00:02:43.997,Come here. Come here.
00:02:48.751,00:02:49.669,Lydia Spring.
00:02:50.753,00:02:55.592,"Patrick Spring has the other machine, the Unlimited Energy Device."
00:02:55.675,00:02:57.844,He's waiting for us at the Perriman Grand.
00:02:57.927,00:02:59.512,Spring is no longer a threat.
00:03:00.346,00:03:01.931,We don't need his other machine.
00:03:02.015,00:03:04.934,You have been running things for too long.
00:03:05.852,00:03:07.687,This is a new era.
00:03:07.770,00:03:09.898,You have lost the path.
00:03:09.981,00:03:10.982,It is time...
00:03:11.983,00:03:13.443,-for a change. -Enough!
00:03:14.152,00:03:14.986,Get the dog.
00:03:15.570,00:03:16.863,"If he resists, shoot it."
00:03:16.946,00:03:18.197,No! No.
00:03:22.535,00:03:24.829,"I will smash this, and I will end it."
00:03:24.913,00:03:27.916,You will spend the rest of your miserable life in that body.
00:03:30.376,00:03:33.046,-Give me my dog. -Put the machine...
00:03:33.588,00:03:35.089,-down. -Give me my dog!
00:03:41.721,00:03:44.182,You... can't beat me.
00:03:47.143,00:03:47.977,Now!
00:03:49.145,00:03:52.232,And I will be back for my goddamn dog!
00:04:01.532,00:04:02.659,What was that?
00:05:12.729,00:05:15.398,Are you the body that houses the soul of Jake Rainey?
00:05:16.274,00:05:18.609,-What are you? -I'm looking for Jake Rainey.
00:05:19.193,00:05:22.071,Are you the body that houses the soul of Jake Rainey?
00:05:24.699,00:05:25.742,Yes.
00:05:49.140,00:05:51.309,-We're not with them! -We're on the same side!
00:05:52.310,00:05:57.774,"Don't you see? This already happened, but there's still time-- Easy-- whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:05:59.776,00:06:02.362,"Dirk, what's going on? Who is this guy?"
00:06:02.820,00:06:03.821,I solved the case.
00:06:04.614,00:06:05.615,And this is...
00:06:06.491,00:06:08.076,Patrick Spring.
00:06:29.097,00:06:30.431,"Ah! Please, don't kill us."
00:06:30.515,00:06:32.308,I can explain everything.
00:06:37.772,00:06:41.275,"You go by Patrick Spring now, but your real name is Zackariah Webb..."
00:06:41.859,00:06:43.736,and you made a terrible mistake.
00:06:44.946,00:06:48.449,"In the 1880s, you attempted to build a Time Machine."
00:06:50.368,00:06:51.369,But there was a problem.
00:06:52.036,00:06:53.955,"At first, the device only half worked."
00:06:54.038,00:06:56.707,"It only sent energy through time, not matter."
00:06:57.708,00:07:00.128,It jumped the very souls right out of the bodies.
00:07:00.211,00:07:02.922,This cost you the lives of many of your beloved pets.
00:07:07.635,00:07:10.304,You accidentally sent the machine into the future.
00:07:12.723,00:07:13.975,the machine came back.
00:07:14.475,00:07:17.895,Not exactly the same as the one you sent. It had been altered.
00:07:20.064,00:07:22.483,"Clearly, something had gone very wrong."
00:07:27.572,00:07:32.910,"Whatever had happened, you had to undo it, so in your mind, you only had one option."
00:07:38.416,00:07:39.292,Jump to the future.
00:07:42.920,00:07:45.923,The machine you used to travel forward was there in your lab...
00:07:47.633,00:07:53.264,but there was no sign of the original Time Machine you accidentally sent into the future that started this whole mess.
00:07:53.347,00:07:54.891,You had to find it.
00:07:57.894,00:08:04.150,"In real time, more than 80 years have passed, and it looks like someone else is now occupying your mansion."
00:08:06.110,00:08:11.782,"There are squatters in the house you abandoned, a group of hippies, led by a man named Jake Rainey."
00:08:11.866,00:08:14.118,And they had your original Time Machine.
00:08:15.119,00:08:17.705,"You say, Hey, give me that machine back."
00:08:18.289,00:08:23.586,"They say, No, this magically appeared from nowhere, and is clearly meant for us. You give us your machine."
00:08:23.669,00:08:25.254,You don't even know what it does.
00:08:25.338,00:08:27.340,We don't care. We're super crazy.
00:08:27.423,00:08:29.258,"No, give me my machine right now."
00:08:30.343,00:08:31.511,There's too many of them.
00:08:31.594,00:08:33.638,"You run, and it's all very scary."
00:08:34.805,00:08:37.391,"To fight him, you need money and resources."
00:08:37.642,00:08:44.482,"Fortunately, you're a brilliant inventor, and you discover a way to turn your Time Machine into an Unlimited Energy Device."
00:08:52.198,00:08:53.741,The advances are irresistible.
00:08:53.824,00:08:58.329,"Also, you can't leave until you wrest your machine back from Rainey."
00:08:58.871,00:09:01.290,But aha! Another wrinkle.
00:09:01.958,00:09:08.631,The bad guys figured out how to use what was originally a glitch in your Time Machine to swap souls into different bodies.
00:09:09.173,00:09:12.134,Rainey could literally become a different person.
00:09:12.552,00:09:17.139,"He used this ability to stay young and grow more powerful, eventually confronting you."
00:09:17.306,00:09:19.600,"Rainey said, Our group is growing."
00:09:20.268,00:09:22.228,You can't hide it forever.
00:09:22.812,00:09:26.023,Just surrender the machine you're using to make energy.
00:09:26.107,00:09:28.693,"And then you said, I can't do that."
00:09:29.277,00:09:30.861,This is gonna be a war.
00:09:31.445,00:09:34.699,"Then everything from here on, the blood is on your hands."
00:09:38.786,00:09:40.204,It already was.
00:09:40.788,00:09:45.293,"You spent decades waging a war in secret, trying to get ahead of your enemy."
00:09:46.252,00:09:49.088,The hippies renamed themselves the Men of the Machine.
00:09:49.463,00:09:51.299,And Rainey made good on his promise.
00:09:51.382,00:09:58.931,"It was war. They wanted your Unlimited Energy Device, and you needed to get back the Time Machine that was now a soul swapper."
00:09:59.015,00:10:02.935,But you couldn't get the upper hand. Things seemed hopeless.
00:10:04.353,00:10:07.231,"Your life was dark, and you were full of rage."
00:10:07.315,00:10:09.567,Could you keep living like this?
00:10:11.235,00:10:13.779,That's when something you never expected happened.
00:10:15.448,00:10:17.366,You fell in love.
00:10:21.912,00:10:24.165,You had a beautiful daughter.
00:10:24.248,00:10:28.294,You were happier than you ever thought you could be. But then...
00:10:31.922,00:10:33.799,...terrible tragedy struck.
00:10:34.508,00:10:36.594,They killed your wife.
00:10:37.678,00:10:40.139,That was the last straw.
00:10:40.222,00:10:42.266,You had finally had enough.
00:10:42.350,00:10:45.144,You decided to skip directly to the end.
00:10:45.895,00:10:50.775,"You jumped to the future, hopefully to catch your enemies completely by surprise."
00:10:57.657,00:10:59.659,Which is what led you here today.
00:11:00.451,00:11:02.286,Is that basically what happened?
00:11:06.916,00:11:09.377,How could you possibly know all that?
00:11:09.960,00:11:11.504,I got it all right?
00:11:11.587,00:11:13.506,"-How? -Well, it seemed obvious to me."
00:11:17.385,00:11:21.222,"So wait, why didn't you just-- Oh, what's the use in picking it all apart?"
00:11:21.305,00:11:23.808,"No, what's done is done and that's that, so great job!"
00:11:23.891,00:11:25.434,I did the best I could.
00:11:25.518,00:11:28.813,"-Definitely, nothing crazy about that. -A series of logical decisions, really."
00:11:29.814,00:11:31.524,We are not the enemy.
00:11:32.191,00:11:35.528,-We are here trying to save your daughter. -My daughter?
00:11:36.570,00:11:38.072,What's happened to my daughter?
00:11:40.449,00:11:44.036,"They're taking her to the Perriman Grand Hotel to meet you-- uh, the older you."
00:11:44.120,00:11:46.372,But there's more elements at play here than you realize.
00:11:53.629,00:11:54.964,Don't get in my way.
00:12:06.350,00:12:08.936,That guy certainly puts the mad in mad scientist.
00:12:10.062,00:12:11.772,"Jesus, he shot the tires out."
00:12:12.523,00:12:14.942,We gotta get out of here before more of them show up.
00:12:15.025,00:12:16.444,Do you know how to work that?
00:12:16.527,00:12:18.946,Those guys don't look too bright. How hard can it be?
00:12:19.029,00:12:20.364,"Oh, come on. All of them?"
00:12:23.325,00:12:24.743,"I mean, the other him."
00:12:24.827,00:12:31.292,"-God damn it, my brain hurts. -I'm still figuring it all out myself, but it's possible that this is why he was murdered."
00:12:32.543,00:12:35.212,"Todd, three questions, one answer."
00:12:37.840,00:12:40.676,We got three maps that led to one solution.
00:12:40.760,00:12:43.262,"Zackariah Webb, Edgar Spring and Patrick Spring."
00:12:43.345,00:12:46.223,Three men are one man jumping through time.
00:12:46.307,00:12:48.601,"The Unlimited Energy Device, the Soul Exchanger, the Time Machine."
00:12:48.684,00:12:54.148,"Three machines are actually one machine existing simultaneously, -but out of chronological sequence. -Wait, wait!"
00:12:54.231,00:12:58.235,"If this is the morning, Patrick Spring, the present Patrick Spring isn't dead yet."
00:12:58.319,00:13:00.446,Farah's still being held by those creepy guys.
00:13:01.530,00:13:02.364,Amanda...
00:13:02.990,00:13:05.534,"Amanda. Oh, my God, we can fix it."
00:13:06.535,00:13:08.704,We can save Lydia Spring and fix everything.
00:13:22.343,00:13:24.887,Aren't you tired of being mindless drones?
00:13:24.970,00:13:27.431,Aren't you all tired of being mindless drones?
00:13:27.515,00:13:29.391,Isn't that why you came to me in the first place?
00:13:29.975,00:13:32.561,"I tell you, I have plans, big plans."
00:13:37.900,00:13:39.818,You said that I could have Rainey's body.
00:13:40.569,00:13:43.781,I want one of the good bodies like the original souls get.
00:13:43.864,00:13:48.744,I am sick and tired of Rainey treating you like you're disposable.
00:13:49.286,00:13:53.749,"Putting you, for years, into dogs and birds."
00:13:54.542,00:13:56.710,It does something to you mentally.
00:13:58.379,00:14:01.006,You... deserve better than that.
00:14:01.090,00:14:03.259,"Yes, I also think that in my head."
00:14:07.638,00:14:09.473,I don't like to be a human anymore.
00:14:09.557,00:14:12.101,You will be a panther.
00:14:12.184,00:14:14.103,"You will be a panther, Ed."
00:14:15.854,00:14:19.316,Do any of you think that I wanna be Gordon Rimmer anymore?
00:14:19.984,00:14:21.110,No!
00:14:21.861,00:14:23.696,We're gonna get both machines.
00:14:24.321,00:14:27.700,We're gonna get them both and all the power that comes with it.
00:14:27.783,00:14:30.828,Then we'll be able to do whatever the hell we want.
00:14:30.911,00:14:33.539,"Hmm. That is what we like best about you, Gordon."
00:14:37.459,00:14:39.670,Who has the kitten?
00:14:43.173,00:14:46.468,"Rainey is a coward, content with the status quo."
00:14:47.052,00:14:49.096,"But not us, not you, not me."
00:14:49.179,00:14:54.184,I am the only one with the balls to use the machine to create things.
00:14:54.852,00:15:00.524,That little kitty cat is what I call a weaponized soul.
00:15:01.275,00:15:02.109,That's right.
00:15:03.152,00:15:04.445,Very dangerous.
00:15:05.487,00:15:06.488,You understand.
00:15:08.157,00:15:13.162,We only use the kitty cat as a last resort.
00:15:15.873,00:15:19.293,You know what is gonna be the sweetest thing of the whole deal?
00:15:20.502,00:15:23.422,Getting me my goddamn dog back!
00:15:28.302,00:15:31.931,"Oh, shit. There's cameras everywhere. Stay down. We can't get caught."
00:15:37.353,00:15:39.730,"Oh, damn it. Quick, hide."
00:15:49.531,00:16:03.253,We don't have time to sneak through the whole zoo. We can't just-- -Do you realize what this is? -Do you realize what that is?
00:16:03.337,00:16:04.463,It's fate.
00:16:04.546,00:16:05.547,It's destiny.
00:16:10.010,00:16:12.137,It's a sign. These are all signs.
00:16:12.221,00:16:14.014,I don't think you're thinking this through.
00:16:14.098,00:16:17.017,"I had a vision, Dirk. I'm ahead of you for once."
00:16:17.101,00:16:19.269,I had a vision of myself wearing these clothes.
00:16:25.234,00:16:26.902,Hey. Someone back there?
00:16:32.908,00:16:34.076,No. Todd.
00:16:37.037,00:16:40.165,Get on the ground and toss the keys! We're taking your truck!
00:16:51.301,00:16:54.388,That's how they got the shark in the kitten. They soul-swapped it.
00:16:54.471,00:16:57.224,"Right. Perhaps. How'd they get a hammerhead shark, though?"
00:16:57.307,00:16:59.935,They have money. They steal the bodies of rich people.
00:17:01.103,00:17:03.981,Do you remember how obsessed Gordon Rimmer was with Lux DuJour?
00:17:04.064,00:17:06.191,"It's because he was Lux DuJour, right?"
00:17:06.275,00:17:07.484,Doesn't that make sense?
00:17:07.568,00:17:10.863,That's why there's been such a tiny response from the police so far.
00:17:10.946,00:17:12.656,They must have people on the inside.
00:17:13.198,00:17:14.199,Right.
00:17:14.283,00:17:16.827,That's why everything's blowing up right now.
00:17:16.910,00:17:24.293,"I mean, that Gordon Rimmer guy, like, rebelled, and at the same time, Patrick Spring, like, shows up from the past and, like, annihilates everybody."
00:17:24.376,00:17:29.381,"It seems like a bunch of unconnected, spontaneous and unlikely coincidences, but it's not. Right?"
00:17:29.465,00:17:31.592,Everything is actually connected.
00:17:32.176,00:17:34.219,You're starting to sound exactly like me.
00:17:36.764,00:17:38.891,I get it. I get everything.
00:18:01.747,00:18:08.462,"Listen, before we go into the hotel, now is the time for us to take a moment and think, really think, about how we're going to do this."
00:18:08.545,00:18:12.758,"We have a unique opportunity here, and we need to be careful how we use it."
00:18:12.841,00:18:15.427,It's 9:36. I didn't get to the penthouse until after 10.
00:18:15.511,00:18:17.429,"If we're gonna do this, we have to go now."
00:18:17.513,00:18:19.765,"There's three elevators: guest, service, freight."
00:18:19.848,00:18:22.434,"If we don't wanna be seen, we can take the service elevator."
00:18:22.518,00:18:25.479,"If Gordon Rimmer and his goons are there, we need a better plan."
00:18:25.562,00:18:28.148,You saw the aftermath of what happened in the penthouse.
00:18:28.232,00:18:30.526,Or what's going to happen. Or not.
00:18:32.194,00:18:34.655,-What are you holding? -It's the lottery ticket.
00:18:36.990,00:18:38.117,I'm meant to have it.
00:18:39.827,00:18:41.120,Or... wait.
00:18:41.203,00:18:48.335,"If the lottery ticket's in this truck, then how could-- -Todd, never mind. You were right. -How could-- There's no time for this. Come on!"
00:19:14.695,00:19:16.488,"Okay, staff elevator's out."
00:19:16.572,00:19:19.116,We can go in through the service entrance and take the freight.
00:19:19.199,00:19:21.410,"It's slow, but if we hurry, we can make it in time."
00:19:21.493,00:19:23.078,Can you get us into the penthouse?
00:19:23.162,00:19:24.413,"Well, no, but..."
00:19:25.622,00:19:29.084,The master key. It's in the office. We can use it on any room in the hotel.
00:19:29.168,00:19:30.002,Masks on.
00:19:55.027,00:19:56.195,Look.
00:19:57.070,00:19:58.989,"Shh. Shh, shh, shh."
00:20:19.635,00:20:32.064,"Wait, if that's the key-- -Stairs? -Stairs."
00:21:00.550,00:21:02.010,This isn't my daughter.
00:21:04.012,00:21:05.264,You catch on quick.
00:21:06.348,00:21:07.432,Where's the machine?
00:21:08.016,00:21:17.985,"Uh, meeting us was only half the deal. You-- You get the machine, the other machine, your father's machine, then you get the soul that goes with the body."
00:21:21.697,00:21:24.491,It's all... already over.
00:21:43.927,00:21:45.595,I've wasted the time.
00:21:47.389,00:21:49.641,Fifteen years preparing for this moment.
00:21:51.810,00:21:53.353,And I still took you for granted.
00:22:08.910,00:22:11.747,"No, no, no. Put the phone down."
00:22:15.625,00:22:17.294,-I've been awake. -Where are you?
00:22:18.503,00:22:19.463,It's time.
00:22:20.964,00:22:25.969,"I'm on my way is where I am and almost there already, so everything's great."
00:22:26.053,00:22:27.888,I said put down the goddamn phone!
00:22:33.185,00:22:34.061,it's over.
00:22:34.144,00:22:37.647,"No, it's not. No, you can still have your daughter."
00:22:37.731,00:22:39.524,You just bring us the other machine.
00:22:47.074,00:22:48.533,Who the hell are you?
00:22:58.168,00:22:59.753,Don't blame yourself.
00:23:01.046,00:23:02.756,-It always ended like this. -Shut up!
00:23:03.423,00:23:06.301,You'd make a deal with these people? They killed Catherine!
00:23:18.730,00:23:20.065,Jesus Christ.
00:23:21.108,00:23:22.150,When you find Lydia...
00:23:23.735,00:23:24.736,tell her I loved her.
00:23:25.946,00:23:28.698,Tell her I'm sorry it never ended any other way.
00:23:32.911,00:23:36.248,-I'm sorry I hit you. -Who the hell are those guys?
00:23:36.331,00:23:37.791,"Oh, no."
00:23:38.333,00:23:39.543,"No, don't!"
00:24:26.006,00:24:27.632,Oh. Mr. Palacios.
00:24:27.716,00:24:28.550,"Todd, perfect."
00:24:28.633,00:24:41.605,"-I need you to get up to 745, pay the guy. -Yes, I-- I was wondering if I could get my check a little early."
00:24:41.688,00:24:42.814,What? Why? Are you okay?
00:24:48.778,00:24:50.655,And do me a favor. Check the penthouse.
00:25:00.582,00:25:01.625,You still have your master key?
00:25:01.708,00:25:04.336,"-No, I misplaced it. -Take mine."
00:25:04.753,00:25:07.088,745 and then the penthouse.
00:25:07.923,00:25:11.426,"Oh, Oh. Jesus Christ. Come on. Come on. We gotta go. Gotta go."
00:25:11.510,00:25:13.428,"Gotta go. Go, go, go!"
00:25:34.824,00:25:36.868,-Listen very carefully. -What's happening?
00:25:36.952,00:25:39.788,"-It's a mess, but we'll figure it out. -Who's that?"
00:25:40.747,00:25:43.250,Your best friend. Hopefully he'll forgive us for this.
00:25:43.333,00:25:46.002,"-Listen. He's at the Ridgely building. -Uh, the Ridgely."
00:25:48.546,00:25:50.548,"Three questions, one answer. You understand?"
00:25:51.216,00:25:52.634,-Do you? -Mm...
00:25:54.511,00:25:58.139,Get the kitten. We forgot it. Go. Run. Don't let them see your face.
00:25:58.223,00:25:59.766,"Okay, I'm..."
00:25:59.849,00:26:03.395,I'm going to do something. Right now!
00:26:04.479,00:26:06.439,Come on! We gotta get out of here! Run!
00:26:21.579,00:26:22.956,"Calm down, calm down."
00:26:23.290,00:26:24.958,It was a loop. It was a time loop!
00:26:25.041,00:26:26.418,You remembered that happening.
00:26:26.501,00:26:29.337,That's how you got the gorilla mask. It wasn't a coincidence.
00:26:29.421,00:26:32.924,"-That's how you knew to get the kitten! -Well, I didn't have any context."
00:26:33.008,00:26:34.509,"Once we got here, it was obvious."
00:26:34.592,00:26:37.345,"To someone reading it in a book, not when you're living it!"
00:26:37.429,00:26:38.930,We have to get out of the hotel.
00:26:39.014,00:26:42.350,You knew it was a Time Machine! You lied to me! You lied the whole time!
00:26:44.769,00:26:47.314,Shut up! Don't you say a word! I don't wanna hear it!
00:26:48.440,00:26:49.399,Wait.
00:26:50.567,00:27:08.877,This is when it happened. That means that-- -What happened? -Where is the machine?
00:27:08.960,00:27:11.296,Something went... really wrong.
00:27:11.379,00:27:13.298,-Where are the others? -Someone came in.
00:27:13.381,00:27:15.884,-Who? -Just-- Just someone! Okay?
00:27:16.468,00:27:21.222,"Someone got in, and now Patrick Spring... is dead."
00:27:23.183,00:27:24.684,What do we do now?
00:27:24.768,00:27:26.686,Figure it out. We'll go to the...
00:27:26.770,00:27:29.606,We'll go to the reliquary. We'll find out what Rainey knows.
00:27:32.067,00:27:33.651,We still accomplished something.
00:27:49.834,00:27:53.380,Maybe don't throw all of it away. We might need some guns...
00:27:56.841,00:27:58.843,Right. Sorry. Okay.
00:28:07.769,00:28:10.271,Your best friend. Hopefully he'll forgive us for this.
00:28:10.355,00:28:12.565,"-He's at the Ridgely building. -Uh, the Ridgely."
00:28:17.946,00:28:20.073,It's from the crime scene everyone's looking for.
00:28:20.156,00:28:22.242,Got you this new shirt in the gift shop.
00:28:22.867,00:28:24.244,I've seen this shirt before.
00:28:24.327,00:28:26.704,"Three questions, one answer. You understand?"
00:28:26.788,00:28:30.125,"-Three questions, one answer. -How could you have possibly known that?"
00:28:32.210,00:28:34.254,-Where? -At the hotel!
00:28:34.337,00:28:36.965,It was a time loop! You remembered that happening!
00:28:42.262,00:28:45.056,You were hit pretty hard back there. Are you feeling any better?
00:28:48.476,00:28:49.352,My name is...
00:28:53.022,00:28:53.857,I'm a detective.
00:28:54.607,00:28:56.484,You hire-- your future self...
00:28:57.235,00:28:59.279,hired me to investigate this whole...
00:29:00.155,00:29:01.698,you dying incident.
00:29:01.781,00:29:03.491,"Uh, well, me and him."
00:29:04.868,00:29:06.035,We're future us.
00:29:06.119,00:29:09.789,We found your Time Machine about a week from now and used it to come back here.
00:29:09.873,00:29:13.251,"Impossible. When I took the machine out of Springsborough, I buried it."
00:29:13.334,00:29:14.461,We dug it up.
00:29:15.253,00:29:18.256,"-Well, how could you-- -You told us how. You left us a map."
00:29:18.590,00:29:21.092,Well... I suppose you will leave us a map.
00:29:21.176,00:29:26.931,"Actually, you did an unnecessarily complicated bit with a map to a map to a map in a maze that was a bit-- what's the word?"
00:29:28.224,00:29:31.102,Killy? And... you are...
00:29:32.270,00:29:34.981,Oh. You are not paying attention.
00:29:35.565,00:29:36.816,You have stopped listening.
00:29:38.359,00:29:39.611,Right.
00:29:48.536,00:29:57.170,We've put our lives at risk for you against an army of body-swapping psychos. The least you could do is-- The Men of the Machine aren't some all-powerful evil empire.
00:29:57.253,00:30:04.427,They're buffoons. Greedy imbeciles too stupid to-- It hasn't stopped them from hurting a lot of people while you became a billionaire.
00:30:04.511,00:30:08.932,"They were so obsessed with the power they discovered, they never took the time to understand it."
00:30:09.015,00:30:11.684,"Well, it seems their blindness has led to their undoing."
00:30:11.935,00:30:17.732,"A bit of dramatic irony, don't you think? Because that's exactly what happened to..."
00:30:18.983,00:30:19.901,you.
00:30:28.034,00:30:28.868,It's not over.
00:30:29.869,00:30:31.788,We still have time to save your daughter.
00:30:35.083,00:30:38.127,"When the machine came back, it had a note on it."
00:30:39.045,00:30:40.088,With your name.
00:30:40.922,00:30:42.382,My... name?
00:30:42.841,00:30:44.551,Yes. Your name.
00:30:45.426,00:30:46.302,Covered in blood.
00:30:48.179,00:30:49.013,Blood?
00:30:49.764,00:30:52.559,These tubes tell the machine which date to travel to.
00:30:53.726,00:30:59.941,"This tube is programmed to 1886, the day I sent it forward and started this whole mess."
00:31:00.024,00:31:03.027,You'll need this tube to send the Time Machine to me in the past.
00:31:03.111,00:31:07.073,"As far as I'm concerned, to save Lydia, all I need to do is take one more jump."
00:31:07.156,00:31:09.826,You're not listening. That isn't even possible.
00:31:09.909,00:31:11.995,The machine I used is in a socket in my lab.
00:31:12.745,00:31:15.039,You use your machine to go back where you started.
00:31:15.123,00:31:15.999,Wait.
00:31:16.916,00:31:17.917,Where's your Time Machine?
00:31:20.003,00:31:22.088,"-Oh, nuts. -We forgot it."
00:31:22.630,00:31:23.464,You what?
00:31:23.548,00:31:27.302,We forgot the Time Machine at the zoo at their temple thing.
00:31:27.385,00:31:31.973,"-How could you be so stupid? -Hey, man, you just killed yourself."
00:31:32.056,00:31:35.560,"After everything you've done, you don't get to tell us how stupid we are."
00:31:35.643,00:31:39.772,I'm over it. I'm over this. How do you not understand?
00:31:39.856,00:31:42.400,You don't win. This is how it ended.
00:31:42.483,00:31:46.029,You don't use the Time Machine again for anything except to go back home.
00:31:46.613,00:31:48.698,How could you know that? 'Cause it's obvious!
00:31:48.781,00:31:51.451,We watched an older version of you die in that hotel room.
00:31:51.534,00:31:54.454,-You have no idea. -Do I understand exactly what happened?
00:31:54.537,00:31:58.124,"Hell, no. But I still think I understand what really matters."
00:31:58.625,00:32:02.211,I was waiting for some big complex payoff where you explain everything...
00:32:02.962,00:32:06.132,but now I get that you're just as blind and crazy as everyone else.
00:32:06.716,00:32:12.388,"You're so obsessed with one mistake that you made a long time ago, you can't see all the people you've hurt along the way."
00:32:14.766,00:32:17.769,You can't... fix everything.
00:32:19.145,00:32:21.147,Some choices you just have to accept.
00:32:22.607,00:32:24.317,And try and rebuild as best you can.
00:32:25.485,00:32:26.319,So...
00:32:28.321,00:32:29.197,accept it.
00:32:30.907,00:32:31.866,I'm sorry.
00:32:35.370,00:32:36.245,You're right.
00:32:37.413,00:32:39.999,"All my inventions, all this death, it's all for nothing."
00:32:40.959,00:32:43.711,"Lydia is the only thing I have left in this world, and my..."
00:32:44.045,00:32:47.340,"foolish, selfish and short-sighted choices have left her alone."
00:32:48.299,00:32:51.511,"I was responsible for her, and my mistakes have ruined everything."
00:33:00.979,00:33:02.647,I'm heading back to 2001.
00:33:04.482,00:33:05.775,My daughter needs me.
00:33:12.323,00:33:13.825,Certain things can't be changed.
00:33:17.745,00:33:18.871,It's you.
00:33:19.455,00:33:23.209,It was you all along. It will always... be you.
00:33:27.839,00:33:28.840,Please save her.
00:33:31.426,00:33:32.427,I will.
00:33:34.220,00:33:35.304,Never enough time.
00:33:36.472,00:33:38.349,Never enough time to figure it all out.
00:33:39.392,00:33:44.147,Maybe make the maps less complicated or murdery or...
00:33:44.230,00:33:46.607,-He's gonna do whatever he did before. -Right.
00:33:52.238,00:33:54.198,It's really tragic when you think about it.
00:33:55.283,00:34:01.289,He leaves us here... returns to the past and spends 15 years preparing for this moment.
00:34:03.041,00:34:05.626,"By all accounts, Spring was a distant father to Lydia..."
00:34:07.003,00:34:08.254,and even more reclusive.
00:34:09.422,00:34:12.550,I suppose... seeing yourself die might do that to you.
00:34:13.968,00:34:15.136,"So, he never won."
00:34:15.845,00:34:17.221,Never woke up from this dream.
00:34:19.140,00:34:21.601,He just ended up trapped and alone forever.
00:34:24.729,00:34:26.898,"I'm trying to figure out what to do next, though."
00:34:26.981,00:34:28.441,Do we try to contact ourselves?
00:34:28.775,00:34:31.152,"I suppose we can't because we didn't, right? Like..."
00:34:31.944,00:34:34.030,"if we don't remember it, then it didn't happen."
00:34:34.113,00:34:37.283,"So, it's possible or probable that we..."
00:34:38.659,00:34:40.745,-That we-- If we-- -The master key...
00:34:41.162,00:34:42.747,was missing the day of the murder.
00:34:45.541,00:34:47.126,It's because I stole my own key.
00:34:48.211,00:34:50.296,And the lottery ticket that I lost...
00:34:51.214,00:34:53.883,I'm the one who found it in the truck in the first place.
00:34:55.343,00:34:57.887,Everything happened exactly the way that it did before.
00:35:02.558,00:35:03.476,You're a monster.
00:35:05.603,00:35:06.729,A monster?
00:35:07.939,00:35:09.398,"Come on, you're overreacting."
00:35:09.482,00:35:11.818,You knew what was happening before you even met me.
00:35:12.151,00:35:13.319,When Dorian died...
00:35:13.986,00:35:15.947,when they tried to kill me on the bridge...
00:35:16.614,00:35:22.161,"when Farah was still being held in that room, when that FBI guy threatened Amanda-- You saw what I said to me."
00:35:24.163,00:35:28.126,When we were almost crushed to death and electrocuted and burned to death and shot...
00:35:28.751,00:35:32.338,"-you knew that we'd end up here. -I didn't know that, exactly."
00:35:32.421,00:35:34.632,Uh... I didn't have any context.
00:35:34.715,00:35:36.884,"And when were you gonna share that with me, huh?"
00:35:37.593,00:35:42.014,I just thought you left things out because you were eccentric or crazy or stupid.
00:35:42.765,00:35:43.683,But you didn't.
00:35:44.183,00:35:45.977,You deliberately hid things from me.
00:35:46.894,00:35:48.521,-You lied to me. -I didn't lie.
00:35:48.604,00:35:54.485,"I just didn't tell you the whole truth because I didn't understand it-- You're a liar, and you've ruined my life..."
00:35:55.319,00:35:56.529,just to have a friend.
00:35:59.073,00:36:01.117,"You deserve to be alone, Dirk."
00:36:03.494,00:36:05.246,I didn't lie.
00:36:06.372,00:36:08.791,You of all people know what a lie looks like by now.
00:36:11.252,00:36:13.171,"No, wait. That wasn't what I meant."
00:36:13.254,00:36:15.464,I'm sorry. I just-- That wasn't what I meant.
00:36:15.548,00:36:16.966,After all this is over...
00:36:18.050,00:36:19.886,"don't ever speak to me again, Dirk."
00:37:06.807,00:37:08.643,"Shit, they're coming. We have to go now."
00:37:08.726,00:37:14.398,"They obviously don't catch us, or they'd remember us in the future from the past, which is currently the present, so... right?"
00:37:14.482,00:37:15.858,What do we do?
00:37:18.069,00:37:20.279,"-What are you doing? -Well, it worked last time."
00:37:20.363,00:37:22.073,"-No, it didn't. -Well, we're not dead."
00:37:22.156,00:37:23.783,I'll take us back to the Wild West.
00:37:23.866,00:37:27.370,-We can stop all of this before it began. -Haven't you been listening?
00:37:27.453,00:37:28.788,-That won't work! -Get off!
00:37:29.330,00:37:32.250,No. We're going back to the future to save Lydia Spring.
00:37:32.333,00:37:36.963,The note with my name had my blood on it. My blood. I cannot-- We are not going back to the Wild West!
00:37:37.046,00:37:39.048,-Everything is connected! -I hate you!
00:37:50.268,00:37:51.143,What?
00:37:51.560,00:37:55.648,Where the-- Shit! Damn it.
00:37:56.190,00:37:57.233,No catch.
00:38:00.736,00:38:01.654,What's next?
00:38:05.283,00:38:07.576,"Break the actuator, trunk opens."
00:38:09.161,00:38:10.162,Maybe.
00:38:26.470,00:38:27.471,Wait.
00:38:43.321,00:38:45.698,"Oh, no. No, no, no."
00:38:46.615,00:38:48.784,"Fred, get the hell out there. See what that is."
00:39:01.339,00:39:02.340,Run!
00:39:16.270,00:39:18.397,No. Wait.
00:39:18.481,00:39:37.833,I can-- Get born.
00:39:38.918,00:39:41.754,Get born through this.
00:39:45.299,00:39:46.634,Rapunzel.
00:39:50.429,00:39:51.430,"Oh, no."
00:39:52.139,00:39:54.058,Gordon Rimmer? What's up?
00:40:16.872,00:40:19.583,and that girl in that girl!
00:40:20.042,00:40:21.168,Stop! Stop!
00:40:37.309,00:40:39.145,-When are we? -Back when we came from.
00:40:42.940,00:40:44.442,"Oh, right."
00:00:33.491,00:00:35.201,Any of you guys smell that?
00:00:35.285,00:00:36.119,What?
00:00:37.037,00:00:38.079,What's wrong?
00:00:38.163,00:00:39.456,Something bad happened.
00:00:46.671,00:00:49.549,"Oh, my God. Run! Run!"
00:00:50.967,00:00:52.093,Rimmer!
00:01:01.686,00:01:02.604,Farah Black?
00:01:03.396,00:01:05.231,You with them now? Drop your weapon.
00:01:05.315,00:01:06.608,They're the ones you want.
00:01:06.691,00:01:08.818,-I am on your side. -There are no sides!
00:01:08.902,00:01:11.279,-Drop the gun now! -You're making a mistake.
00:01:11.362,00:01:12.906,You're pointing your weapon at a police officer.
00:01:12.989,00:01:17.327,"-Just listen to what I'm telling you. -Drop it! Five, four, three, two-- Okay."
00:01:21.664,00:01:22.499,Okay.
00:01:37.222,00:01:39.933,-I solved the mystery. -Don't talk.
00:01:41.059,00:01:43.353,Put some pressure right-- right here.
00:01:45.605,00:01:47.106,"Oh, God. Todd?"
00:01:49.984,00:01:50.819,They're gone now.
00:01:51.444,00:01:54.864,-We're going to be okay now. -You sure about that?
00:02:13.967,00:02:17.220,"It's tough to be a princess, but I like a challenge."
00:02:20.974,00:02:22.308,when everybody loves you?
00:02:24.644,00:02:28.231,Sometimes I feel like I've walked into someone else's dream.
00:02:30.358,00:02:31.651,Everything is connected.
00:02:31.734,00:02:34.612,"Hey, Bart, I got clothes. This is all I could find."
00:02:34.696,00:02:37.198,"I stole it from downstairs, so..."
00:02:38.783,00:02:41.494,-Bart? -Why are you in such a hurry?
00:02:45.707,00:02:46.833,Right?
00:02:49.127,00:02:52.630,Maybe we could just stay here and watch the TV.
00:02:53.214,00:02:56.968,They got these shows in between shows that show you things you can buy in a store.
00:02:57.051,00:02:58.469,-Commercials? -Yeah.
00:02:59.137,00:03:00.179,They're terrific.
00:03:04.309,00:03:05.268,Commercials it is.
00:03:05.351,00:03:08.980,...and suddenly your parents hate you and your brother's gay.
00:03:10.857,00:03:12.400,If you can't be a princess...
00:03:12.483,00:03:14.235,I never had a surprise before.
00:03:17.322,00:03:19.240,"I only got two bullets left, eh?"
00:03:20.366,00:03:21.826,I still hurt all over.
00:03:24.203,00:03:25.330,-Maybe-- -Bart.
00:03:26.789,00:03:27.665,Two bullets?
00:03:28.917,00:03:29.751,Seriously?
00:03:30.501,00:03:31.669,That's your excuse.
00:03:32.587,00:03:34.505,I saw you kill someone by waving at them.
00:03:35.089,00:03:38.343,All that stuff you said to me about life and purpose and stuff?
00:03:40.511,00:03:45.099,You think maybe... surprises are good sometimes?
00:03:46.851,00:03:49.938,"Like, there can be such a thing as a surprise that helps you?"
00:03:56.027,00:04:02.367,"Yeah, and what doesn't kill you, you know, usually makes you-- Makes you hurt real bad, it makes you cry."
00:04:04.327,00:04:05.411,Makes you stronger.
00:04:06.579,00:04:07.705,It's...
00:04:08.289,00:04:09.123,Yeah.
00:04:17.590,00:04:19.008,"I think you're right, Ken."
00:04:20.593,00:04:22.971,I think I wanna see where those two bullets go.
00:04:23.972,00:04:24.806,Okay.
00:04:25.473,00:04:29.269,"You know, I'll bet... that if you head out that door and start walking..."
00:04:30.853,00:04:31.980,you'll find out.
00:04:44.617,00:04:45.493,Okay.
00:04:54.043,00:04:55.128,You saved me.
00:04:57.422,00:04:58.589,Don't rub it in.
00:05:01.759,00:05:06.264,Just another crazy... situation.
00:05:10.852,00:05:11.686,Farah.
00:05:13.771,00:05:15.189,The night you were kidnapped...
00:05:18.359,00:05:20.653,it was me behind the door you were knocking on.
00:05:22.447,00:05:25.116,-I didn't let you in-- -I knew that.
00:05:25.199,00:05:26.326,Obviously.
00:05:28.202,00:05:32.040,"It's not like I forgot which door I knocked on, Todd."
00:05:32.123,00:05:35.126,It's my fault. I had my weapon drawn.
00:05:35.710,00:05:40.214,"-Well, right, but-- -When I met you that first night, you saved my life."
00:05:40.715,00:05:47.013,"By the time I realized that was your door, I knew you well enough to understand why that door did not open that night."
00:05:51.726,00:05:54.103,Ah. See?
00:05:55.396,00:05:59.609,You also knew... a thing.
00:06:02.361,00:06:05.448,I didn't lie to you any more than you lied to Farah.
00:06:05.531,00:06:06.574,"Yes, you did."
00:06:08.451,00:06:14.332,I would describe it as... strategic no-truthing.
00:06:18.961,00:06:19.879,"Come on, go."
00:06:22.965,00:06:24.092,Go.
00:06:26.385,00:06:27.512,Stop. Stop!
00:06:28.930,00:06:30.014,"Calm down, Lydia."
00:06:30.973,00:06:33.392,It's gonna be all right. We're gonna figure this out.
00:06:34.685,00:06:35.520,Maybe.
00:06:36.896,00:06:40.775,"The corgi knows, or rather, Lydia Spring knows."
00:06:41.359,00:06:43.277,"I'm sorry, Miss Spring."
00:06:48.533,00:06:49.575,You shut up!
00:06:50.952,00:06:51.786,All right?
00:06:53.412,00:06:54.747,I need to focus. I need to...
00:06:55.248,00:06:56.374,I gotta figure this out.
00:06:56.999,00:06:59.418,All right? What is this place? Who are you people?
00:07:00.628,00:07:02.421,How the hell did you do this to her?
00:07:03.548,00:07:04.382,I want answers.
00:07:05.174,00:07:06.592,Talk!
00:07:12.181,00:07:14.267,-You said you wanted answers. -I want reality!
00:07:15.059,00:07:22.775,"I want my reality back, and I want it back right goddamn now-- I am not the enemy."
00:07:29.365,00:07:31.451,I just wanna know what's going on.
00:07:33.536,00:07:36.998,"Look, please, will somebody tell me what's going on?"
00:07:37.081,00:07:37.999,Huh?
00:07:38.708,00:07:39.876,Please.
00:07:50.511,00:08:00.229,"More than a hundred years ago, a man named Zackariah Webb built a machine that broke and went to the future where these tattooed wackos found it and used it to swap souls."
00:08:09.322,00:08:11.199,I hate everything about this right now.
00:08:11.282,00:08:36.557,"In 2002, after the Men of the Machine killed his wife, Patrick Spring, who was a fake identity created to be the son of Edgar Spring, who was actually Zackariah Webb, jumped forward in time to last week, destroyed the Men of the Machine, and then went to the Perriman Grand to confront his future self, which led to the young Patrick Spring accidentally killing old Patrick Spring when a kitten went off and set off a shark explosion."
00:08:43.773,00:08:45.525,"Fairly straightforward, I think."
00:08:46.067,00:08:49.445,"Estevez, there's still a way to save Lydia."
00:08:49.529,00:08:50.363,That's right.
00:08:51.739,00:08:58.955,"You destroyed this machine and this plug, -but there's another way. -How?"
00:08:59.956,00:09:00.831,That thing.
00:09:01.415,00:09:03.292,It's another version of the same machine.
00:09:04.001,00:09:05.711,And we know where to plug it in.
00:09:10.716,00:09:12.301,You can't come in here like that.
00:09:12.385,00:09:14.470,"Shut up, idiot. I'm talking to the captain."
00:09:14.720,00:09:16.097,-Hey! -Boys.
00:09:16.180,00:09:17.348,-Get in here. -Stand down.
00:09:18.724,00:09:22.103,-What the hell do you think you're doing? -They stole the soul exchanger!
00:09:23.187,00:09:24.313,And you know who has it?
00:09:25.856,00:09:27.900,Your man. Estevez.
00:09:28.484,00:09:29.318,So...
00:09:31.737,00:09:32.613,it's finally over.
00:09:37.994,00:09:41.747,I've been making calls to Brothers in high places all day.
00:09:41.831,00:09:42.915,Nobody's picking up.
00:09:42.999,00:09:45.418,There's no one left to help you.
00:09:46.252,00:09:48.671,"Coming here, you put me in danger."
00:09:49.589,00:09:51.799,The Men of the Machine are over. You've destroyed us!
00:09:51.882,00:09:52.717,"No, no, no."
00:09:53.342,00:09:56.887,They're gonna try and switch Lydia and Rapunzel back.
00:09:56.971,00:09:59.724,"We get that machine back, we get control."
00:09:59.807,00:10:02.810,We are gonna go to the only altar that's left.
00:10:03.227,00:10:06.689,"We're gonna take men, we're gonna take weapons, and we're gonna go there."
00:10:07.231,00:10:11.360,"If we quit now, then we lose everything. But no."
00:10:13.529,00:10:14.614,We go there.
00:10:29.629,00:10:33.924,I feel less walk-y and more fall-y right now.
00:10:34.342,00:10:36.260,Don't mention it. You gonna stay with us?
00:10:37.011,00:10:40.473,"-What, you mean, like the living people? -Yeah."
00:10:40.556,00:10:45.936,"Ideally, yes, but you know how things are when you got the cereal bowl flower exchange."
00:10:46.771,00:10:47.605,Say what?
00:10:48.481,00:10:52.985,There's a lot of wording happening should me no talk good 'cause blood all gone.
00:10:53.069,00:10:54.779,-Right. -Arrow have.
00:10:55.237,00:10:56.072,I see that.
00:10:57.156,00:10:58.699,"Todd, are you good?"
00:11:00.076,00:11:02.078,The answer to that question is kind of long.
00:11:02.953,00:11:03.788,Let's go.
00:11:04.330,00:11:05.331,Come on.
00:11:06.666,00:11:07.583,Here we go.
00:11:07.667,00:11:10.169,There are six entrances to the house.
00:11:10.920,00:11:15.966,There's no way we can cover all of them. If anyone comes in-- Wait. Would they come here?
00:11:16.050,00:11:20.971,"This thing is, like, their most sacred... thing."
00:11:21.389,00:11:22.973,They're gonna be mad we took it.
00:11:23.057,00:11:25.684,So... they know what's under this place.
00:11:27.186,00:11:28.354,What is under this place?
00:11:28.437,00:11:30.189,A place with the...
00:11:32.191,00:11:34.235,"mm, stuff."
00:11:38.447,00:11:40.324,"Oh, shit, Miss Black."
00:11:41.409,00:11:42.743,How much of this is legal?
00:11:43.702,00:11:52.044,"There are a number of loopholes legally, regarding what constitutes a militia -with relevance to state law-- -You know what? Never mind."
00:11:52.920,00:11:55.214,This is the least illegal shit I've done all day.
00:11:56.590,00:11:58.467,"If it's a time machine, can I go back?"
00:11:58.551,00:12:00.010,Go back? Where?
00:12:00.845,00:12:01.679,Save my partner.
00:12:02.263,00:12:03.806,Some things can't be changed.
00:12:08.644,00:12:10.604,-Lydia first. -Dirk!
00:12:17.945,00:12:19.864,Are you sure you know what you're doing?
00:12:19.947,00:12:22.158,No. I only saw them do this once.
00:12:23.784,00:12:26.162,"We jump them, and they switch places."
00:12:26.245,00:12:27.705,Make thing switchy.
00:12:29.832,00:12:32.334,The Men of the Machine had a whole contraption for it.
00:12:42.970,00:12:44.346,Is it supposed to do that?
00:12:44.430,00:12:46.599,I'm not qualified to answer that question.
00:12:46.682,00:12:49.268,Why can't I go back? It's already on. I could go back.
00:12:49.351,00:12:51.270,I could fix this. I could fix everything.
00:12:51.353,00:12:52.396,Bring Lydia here.
00:12:53.022,00:12:56.484,Why are we even bothering with this? I could stop him from being kidnapped.
00:12:56.567,00:12:59.111,Because it doesn't work that way. Because it-- aah!
00:13:01.071,00:13:02.531,We're too close to give up now.
00:13:04.783,00:13:05.784,Hold her there.
00:13:13.584,00:13:16.086,"Okay, Estevez, push that crank."
00:13:32.269,00:13:33.729,"Breach and clear, gentlemen."
00:13:49.036,00:13:50.079,What the hell is that?
00:13:52.957,00:13:53.958,Hang on.
00:13:54.500,00:13:56.377,"-Hey! -No, no. You have to trust me."
00:13:56.460,00:13:58.420,"-No, you killed her! -Switch them now!"
00:13:58.504,00:13:59.713,I got her. I got her.
00:14:00.965,00:14:03.384,"-She's dead, man. -That's how you do it."
00:14:05.261,00:14:11.267,"-Is this what's supposed to happen? -It's gonna work. Here, three, two, one."
00:14:16.480,00:14:19.275,"Hey. Hey. Come on, Lydia."
00:14:32.705,00:14:33.581,Screw this.
00:14:38.043,00:14:38.878,Come on.
00:14:53.809,00:14:54.643,Farah?
00:14:55.477,00:14:56.353,Lydia?
00:14:57.730,00:14:58.606,"Oh, my God!"
00:15:03.235,00:15:04.111,It worked.
00:15:04.737,00:15:07.656,-Holy shit! -I thought we would never get you back.
00:15:07.740,00:15:10.868,I'm so stupid. I should've never gone to that guy's house.
00:15:11.493,00:15:12.620,I knew you could do it.
00:15:13.829,00:15:17.458,"The moment I saw you, I knew everything was gonna be all right."
00:15:17.541,00:15:18.834,Okay. Okay.
00:15:19.627,00:15:20.461,Okay.
00:15:26.175,00:15:27.509,Thank you so much.
00:15:28.093,00:15:29.887,"We did the best we could for you, Lydia."
00:15:35.643,00:15:37.394,These guys threw me off a bridge.
00:15:39.772,00:15:41.649,I'll help you up. Come on.
00:15:43.275,00:15:44.109,Look at me.
00:15:49.406,00:15:50.616,We got company.
00:15:50.699,00:15:53.661,"-Wait, Farah, where are you going? -Stay here."
00:15:54.662,00:15:56.372,"-Farah, wait. -Stay here!"
00:16:01.418,00:16:02.628,Jesus!
00:16:20.771,00:16:23.273,-We have to send it back. -Send it back?
00:16:23.357,00:16:25.109,We should destroy the stupid thing.
00:16:27.444,00:16:32.199,"It needs this, needs to go back to where it came from to start the loop again."
00:16:35.077,00:16:37.329,I watched him feed me dog food.
00:16:38.205,00:16:43.502,"I've been sleeping on the streets for a week, I was so hungry, I ate a rat!"
00:16:44.086,00:16:46.130,If we don't send the machine back in time...
00:16:49.008,00:16:50.467,you won't exist.
00:16:52.594,00:16:54.179,It all revolves around you.
00:16:55.180,00:17:07.526,"This has to go back to your dad so that he can try and manipulate the future and... eventually meet your mom and sex with her and-- -Todd, Todd, Todd? -Everything's spinning."
00:17:07.609,00:17:08.861,"Yep, still."
00:17:08.944,00:17:11.989,"-You guys are both dying. -No. No, we're not."
00:17:12.865,00:17:13.741,We're okay.
00:17:15.617,00:17:17.369,-Todd. -We have to get out of here.
00:17:21.623,00:17:24.001,Your dad did all of this to save you.
00:17:26.128,00:17:29.757,He died... to save your life.
00:17:39.058,00:17:39.892,Okay.
00:17:41.560,00:17:42.436,What do I do?
00:17:50.277,00:17:51.528,Come on!
00:17:57.910,00:17:58.744,Shit!
00:18:01.580,00:18:02.873,What do I do now?
00:18:02.956,00:18:05.417,"How do I, like, turn it on or whatever?"
00:18:05.501,00:18:06.835,Turn the crank.
00:18:10.172,00:18:12.716,"Wait. No, no... wait."
00:18:14.676,00:18:15.511,Shit.
00:18:16.178,00:18:17.513,-You're right. -Okay.
00:18:26.480,00:18:27.314,Okay.
00:18:28.315,00:18:30.359,"Okay, wait. Maybe if I could just..."
00:18:38.867,00:18:40.035,Really?
00:18:49.962,00:18:51.547,Stop right now!
00:19:00.973,00:19:02.266,-Cover! -Yep!
00:19:08.480,00:19:09.648,Covering!
00:19:10.774,00:19:11.608,Moving!
00:19:25.539,00:19:28.542,"And then what? What then, Lydia Spring?"
00:19:28.625,00:19:29.668,What then?
00:19:32.880,00:19:33.881,"Who's that, Ed?"
00:19:35.757,00:19:36.675,Yo.
00:19:40.053,00:19:50.606,But-- Uh...
00:19:53.609,00:19:56.653,I'm sorry about earlier. I'll do it right this time.
00:19:59.823,00:20:00.657,This is it.
00:20:01.325,00:20:03.952,"These bald guys, these are the guys that hired me."
00:20:04.536,00:20:05.579,The day you found me?
00:20:06.830,00:20:07.664,And this thing...
00:20:09.291,00:20:11.752,This is the thing that they hired me to build.
00:20:16.131,00:20:17.007,Here.
00:20:24.056,00:20:25.015,Can you fix this?
00:20:25.766,00:20:26.600,Yes.
00:20:30.812,00:20:31.688,It's my destiny.
00:20:42.407,00:20:43.575,Where is my gun?
00:20:46.787,00:20:49.039,"Hey, Rapunzel. Hi. Hi."
00:20:56.129,00:20:57.005,Give me my dog.
00:21:02.094,00:21:03.262,Drop your gun.
00:21:04.137,00:21:06.682,I am gonna shoot you in the head.
00:21:08.350,00:21:13.605,Heh. I am gonna shoot you in the head and take my goddamn dog!
00:21:14.147,00:21:15.816,One of those things is gonna happen.
00:21:38.922,00:21:40.173,I think I did it.
00:21:42.634,00:21:43.719,I think I finished it.
00:21:45.846,00:21:48.557,"Bart, this is why you lead me here."
00:21:49.266,00:21:50.559,Still got one bullet left.
00:22:09.328,00:22:10.162,Weird.
00:22:25.385,00:22:26.219,Okay.
00:22:29.681,00:22:30.640,"Bye, Dirk."
00:22:32.809,00:22:34.978,Let's get out of here. These people are nutjobs.
00:23:03.006,00:23:03.882,On three.
00:23:05.342,00:23:09.304,"One, two, three."
00:23:29.825,00:23:31.076,Solved it.
00:23:44.673,00:23:45.549,Amanda?
00:23:46.800,00:23:47.843,You came back?
00:23:47.926,00:23:52.222,"Me and The Rowdy 3 came and saved you. They say that's the last time, by the way."
00:23:52.305,00:23:54.432,-Save me? -Yeah. Duh.
00:23:55.267,00:23:56.101,Saved everyone.
00:23:56.768,00:24:00.564,"There were a hundred dudes out there and we beat them up, and then they ran away."
00:24:00.647,00:24:02.566,"Dude, it was sick."
00:24:03.150,00:24:06.027,-Where's Dirk? -The cop took him to the hospital.
00:24:07.195,00:24:08.363,It was not pretty.
00:24:12.117,00:24:13.869,She said to meet her at this address at six.
00:24:17.247,00:24:20.876,Dirk says you hate him now 'cause he tricked you or something.
00:24:21.543,00:24:23.086,He ruined my life.
00:24:23.170,00:24:24.004,Right.
00:24:24.588,00:24:26.715,"All right. Later, Todd."
00:24:28.008,00:24:28.842,Wait.
00:24:30.218,00:24:31.052,What?
00:24:31.720,00:24:33.221,You have another lottery ticket?
00:24:34.097,00:24:35.849,What was your plan with that anyway?
00:24:39.019,00:24:42.397,I was gonna try and... fix things.
00:24:43.565,00:24:44.399,Fix everything.
00:24:46.109,00:24:48.111,"There's some things you don't fix, Todd."
00:24:49.070,00:24:53.033,"Sometimes when you fall down, you fall all the way down."
00:24:55.285,00:24:56.119,You blew it.
00:24:57.245,00:24:58.246,That's the way it is.
00:25:04.920,00:25:06.254,Here's what I do believe.
00:25:07.422,00:25:10.634,I think Dirk Gently came into your life for a reason.
00:25:11.301,00:25:21.394,"I mean, two weeks ago, you were a 33-year-old hotel bellhop, with no money and no friends, who spent all of his time lying to me."
00:25:22.395,00:25:23.230,Now look at you.
00:25:23.813,00:25:27.234,You're the badass partner to a psychic detective.
00:25:28.693,00:25:30.070,And you're honest.
00:25:31.279,00:25:33.323,Think about why Dirk lied to you.
00:25:34.324,00:25:36.076,"You and Dirk, you saved that girl."
00:25:37.244,00:25:38.954,You saved that girl's life.
00:25:39.955,00:25:44.542,"No matter what he lied about, isn't that the part that matters?"
00:25:47.254,00:25:48.463,"I'll see you around, Todd."
00:25:52.801,00:25:55.679,Are you really gonna... leave with those guys?
00:25:56.638,00:25:58.765,"I mean, Todd, come on."
00:26:00.350,00:26:01.726,They already gave me a jacket.
00:26:23.039,00:26:26.084,"You did a thing back there, with the thing."
00:26:26.585,00:26:27.877,"Yes, I did."
00:26:29.087,00:26:30.171,"And you did, too."
00:26:31.673,00:26:33.800,"Hey, that guy, um, Dirk Gently..."
00:26:35.552,00:26:39.639,you weren't supposed to kill him. You were supposed to protect him.
00:26:43.226,00:26:45.770,"I was supposed to bring you there, too, so..."
00:26:46.771,00:26:50.275,"You did the thing and now that you did it, you're gonna leave and..."
00:26:52.193,00:26:53.028,Like...
00:26:54.112,00:26:55.989,You did your destiny or whatever.
00:26:56.906,00:26:59.242,"And now that you did it, maybe you're gonna go."
00:27:01.453,00:27:04.039,"And it's bad, Ken."
00:27:08.626,00:27:12.505,"You do whatever you want, you know, because I kidnapped you and..."
00:27:14.633,00:27:16.760,It must have been really bad for you.
00:27:17.719,00:27:20.722,"You know, I didn't think about your feelings and all that, and..."
00:27:29.606,00:27:31.024,I don't want you to go...
00:27:33.360,00:27:34.194,I think.
00:27:36.321,00:27:37.155,Hey.
00:27:40.909,00:27:42.160,I'm not going anywhere.
00:27:48.583,00:27:50.043,"Oh, okay."
00:27:56.341,00:27:59.219,Security will meet you on the ground in Belize.
00:27:59.302,00:28:01.137,You cannot call me when you land.
00:28:01.221,00:28:03.014,"From there, you'll be on your own."
00:28:03.556,00:28:08.144,You can access your father's offshore accounts-- I don't understand why I have to leave the country.
00:28:08.228,00:28:09.062,It's just for now.
00:28:09.729,00:28:12.482,We don't know how many of them are still out there.
00:28:12.565,00:28:15.777,They could still be looking for you. I don't even know who they are.
00:28:15.860,00:28:19.489,They're a cult formed around the machine my father sent forward from the past.
00:28:19.572,00:28:21.741,They use a broken aspect of the machine to swap bodies.
00:28:22.367,00:28:25.829,"The guy who kidnapped me was a rock star, and he got mad and betrayed them."
00:28:25.912,00:28:30.417,"On the same day, my father traveled into the future to get revenge for the murder of my mother."
00:28:32.210,00:28:35.588,I am so sorry things ended this way. I...
00:28:36.840,00:28:40.427,"-I let you down, I let your father down-- -What are you talking about?"
00:28:40.510,00:28:42.846,It was a time loop. There was nothing you could do.
00:28:46.099,00:28:47.100,Don't you see that?
00:28:48.101,00:28:51.104,"Farah, you kicked everyone's ass and saved me."
00:28:51.187,00:28:54.023,It was so... you.
00:28:56.317,00:28:57.444,It was?
00:28:57.527,00:29:02.031,"Yeah. Ever since I was little, you were the most inspiring person ever."
00:29:02.949,00:29:05.827,But you always try to hide from what a freak you are.
00:29:06.453,00:29:13.960,"And then when my dad died, and I was a dog and everything was hopeless, there you are with an army of weirdos, saving the day."
00:29:15.295,00:29:16.337,It was perfect.
00:29:16.755,00:29:18.548,You are perfect.
00:29:27.766,00:29:30.185,"Good luck, Farah. I love you."
00:29:30.268,00:29:31.436,"I love you, too."
00:29:34.105,00:29:35.523,I just gave you $4 million.
00:29:36.274,00:29:37.108,How?
00:29:37.609,00:29:39.277,By phone. Duh.
00:29:39.986,00:29:42.405,Have fun with your new friends. They seem insane.
00:29:43.990,00:29:45.033,Okay.
00:29:50.789,00:29:53.708,"In the beginning, it was just an idea."
00:29:53.792,00:29:54.626,I wanted...
00:29:58.880,00:30:06.513,"I wanted so badly to believe that there was something bigger, a bigger pattern, bigger meaning."
00:30:08.014,00:30:08.973,I knew...
00:30:09.974,00:30:13.144,"when I first met you, I found it."
00:30:13.812,00:30:17.482,"It was real, it was all real, and you were proof."
00:30:20.485,00:30:21.945,You are what you say you are.
00:30:23.863,00:30:25.073,And I am so proud of you.
00:30:53.434,00:30:57.480,"Puffles the horse had faked-- -Yes, faked his death by-- -I need the chair."
00:30:58.898,00:31:00.567,-Sorry? -That you're in.
00:31:01.693,00:31:03.278,"Oh, yes, quite."
00:31:12.495,00:31:13.329,Very well.
00:31:15.540,00:31:16.499,Here I am again.
00:31:20.920,00:31:22.005,"Todd, you're..."
00:31:23.590,00:31:27.385,"here. Hmm, but the case is over."
00:31:28.553,00:31:29.804,How's your shoulder?
00:31:29.888,00:31:32.974,"It's... terrible, actually."
00:31:33.391,00:31:35.643,"Look, I don't-- I don't understand."
00:31:36.811,00:31:39.105,Did you want something from me or...
00:31:40.773,00:31:44.986,I can't help you. I can't do anything to help your situation-- I don't need help.
00:31:45.778,00:31:46.613,Here.
00:31:48.781,00:31:50.325,I got this from your apartment.
00:31:50.992,00:31:52.201,"Oh, um..."
00:31:53.661,00:31:55.538,That's a Mexican Funeral T-shirt.
00:31:56.039,00:32:01.544,"I don't have many left, so try not to... get shot in it."
00:32:05.173,00:32:08.343,"Look, I am sorry, but I don't understand. You're..."
00:32:10.386,00:32:12.472,What do you want? Why are you here?
00:32:13.806,00:32:15.808,I'm here because I'm your friend.
00:32:16.935,00:32:20.146,"Besides, I don't wanna miss out on when the next case starts."
00:32:24.025,00:32:30.907,So-- Didn't you say this band hated you?
00:32:32.033,00:32:32.867,"Yeah, well..."
00:32:36.621,00:32:38.331,We're late. Farah wants to meet up.
00:32:39.290,00:32:40.124,What? Really?
00:32:41.417,00:32:46.965,"Once Estevez gives us the all-clear, some people are going to ask us some questions."
00:32:47.048,00:32:48.841,Undoubtedly. And how do we answer them?
00:32:48.925,00:32:51.928,We can't tell people about the time machine. We'll sound insane.
00:32:52.011,00:32:54.973,-We don't want to sound insane. -We wanna sound like sane guys.
00:32:55.056,00:32:56.057,So sane we're boring.
00:32:56.140,00:32:59.811,Two boring sane guys having a normal time.
00:32:59.894,00:33:05.441,"Let's say, best case scenario, we come out of this not arrested despite all the... deaths."
00:33:05.525,00:33:06.776,"Yeah, the-- the deaths."
00:33:06.859,00:33:07.860,What then?
00:33:08.444,00:33:13.199,I'd like to make an investment in your detective agency.
00:33:13.282,00:33:14.117,-Really? -What?
00:33:17.829,00:33:20.623,I accept your proposal as my venture capitalist.
00:33:20.707,00:33:22.792,Proof of concept has already been established.
00:33:22.875,00:33:25.169,But I remain quite firm on the signage.
00:33:25.253,00:33:26.212,A brass plaque.
00:33:26.963,00:33:31.259,Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. Name recognition and all that.
00:33:31.342,00:33:33.553,Wouldn't wanna muddy it with Farahs and Todds.
00:33:33.636,00:33:35.430,It's cleaner this way. And...
00:33:38.307,00:33:40.685,I don't think it's fair to nix her name.
00:33:40.768,00:33:45.982,"No, I-- I'd prefer my name to remain off the... name."
00:33:46.065,00:33:48.192,"Oh! So, it's settled. And Todd."
00:33:48.985,00:33:50.945,I feel like you're no longer an assistant.
00:33:51.779,00:33:54.115,I'm promoting you to ward.
00:33:54.198,00:33:55.867,-Isn't that like a male nanny? -Yeah.
00:33:55.950,00:33:58.995,"I'm not-- Okay, Dirk, you're pissing me off again."
00:33:59.078,00:34:01.372,"Oh! What, you-- you don't like the title?"
00:34:02.498,00:34:03.624,It could always be...
00:34:47.418,00:34:48.252,The hell?
00:34:52.757,00:34:56.177,"Trying to cover up your tracks, ass... hole?"
00:35:06.145,00:35:17.532,"Dang it. For Pete's sakes, now it's-- Man, now it's-- This is perfect. This is just so me."
00:35:18.116,00:35:20.535,I don't know why I shot you. Are you okay?
00:35:22.370,00:35:24.664,Duh. No. Sorry.
00:35:24.747,00:35:26.290,You don't know what's going on?
00:35:26.916,00:35:31.671,"No, right, I-- I know about the body-swapping guys and the machine."
00:35:31.754,00:35:38.302,"We just burned the Spring house down and cleaned that up, then we went and burned their place down, too, at the zoo."
00:35:38.386,00:35:41.347,"No, I've just been... burning everything down."
00:35:41.973,00:35:43.391,We had a big file on that.
00:35:43.474,00:35:46.060,"We have files on, like, everything."
00:35:46.561,00:35:48.646,And what do they want me to do? Read them all?
00:35:49.105,00:35:50.356,I can't do that.
00:35:50.439,00:35:57.321,It's-- It's boring. I-- I just wanted to be in charge.
00:36:06.581,00:36:08.499,You know they can't arrest me?
00:36:09.750,00:36:17.884,"Like, we're gonna go kill the rest of those body-swapping guys and it's all, like, top secret, so it's off of books."
00:36:17.967,00:36:21.262,"And all I had to do was write, like, an e-mail."
00:36:21.846,00:36:24.765,"And then we're gonna go get the, uh-- the psychics, too."
00:36:24.849,00:36:27.518,All the ones that we've been tracking and more.
00:36:27.935,00:36:43.701,"And they wouldn't let Riggins do it, I guess, but they like me... more better, We have to kill everybody who knows about it."
00:36:45.661,00:36:48.122,"So, guess I gotta kill you, too."
00:36:48.206,00:36:49.040,No.
00:36:50.333,00:36:52.960,"No, you don't have to do that. You don't, um..."
00:36:57.006,00:37:00.259,I don't even understand any of this. I'm just trying to be a good cop.
00:37:01.719,00:37:03.179,I'm trying to be a good cop.
00:37:03.262,00:37:05.514,"Please, you don't-- you don't have to."
00:37:06.098,00:37:08.684,"-Please, man. -Are you reaching for your gun right now?"
00:37:23.866,00:37:24.867,I'm just doing my job.
00:37:26.577,00:37:29.705,"-So, if we do this-- -We're already doing it."
00:37:29.789,00:37:33.000,"-Well, how do we find a case? -Just let yourself feel it."
00:37:35.795,00:37:37.797,"Okay, take a moment."
00:37:42.843,00:37:43.678,Feel anything?
00:37:45.680,00:37:46.681,"Okay, close your eyes."
00:37:52.144,00:37:53.062,Anything at all?
00:37:55.982,00:37:57.149,I...
00:37:59.986,00:38:00.987,To go to the bathroom.
00:38:05.408,00:38:07.618,Mm-hmm. Yeah.
00:38:13.749,00:38:15.710,"Farah, would you excuse me for a moment?"
00:38:28.764,00:38:29.724,Thanks.
00:38:35.271,00:38:36.564,Whoo-hoo!
00:38:50.870,00:38:53.456,"Vogle, get her out of here."
00:38:56.917,00:38:58.336,-What? -Go on! Get!
00:38:58.419,00:38:59.253,Come on!
00:39:17.480,00:39:18.522,Hands in the air.
00:39:25.237,00:39:26.405,You wanna rush?
00:39:29.075,00:39:30.117,Let's rush!
00:40:02.316,00:40:03.776,Not now.
00:40:14.412,00:40:15.246,Dirk?
00:40:29.635,00:40:32.221,"-Amanda? -Todd! Todd, oh, my God, they're coming!"
00:40:32.304,00:40:34.515,-It's really bad. -What? What's happening? Who's coming?
00:40:57.163,00:41:01.375,"-Todd? Todd, what's happening? -Oh, God!"
00:41:01.459,00:41:02.293,Todd!
