00:02:23.083,00:02:24.250,for the bugs to eat.
00:02:25.666,00:02:26.791,You're welcome.
00:24:33.666,00:24:35.250,What's a mixtape?
00:53:05.250,00:53:07.458,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
00:00:40.166,00:00:41.458,"Oh, yeah."
00:00:44.166,00:00:45.791,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:01:06.416,00:01:08.791,"Well, try new Fat Crusher 2000."
00:01:48.541,00:01:51.000,"40? Girl, 40 ain't shit."
00:01:51.083,00:01:52.833,You? Almost 40?
00:01:52.916,00:01:56.208,I started living my life when I was 40.
00:01:56.291,00:01:58.291,"Damn, you that old, Miss B?"
00:01:59.791,00:02:02.791,40 means... juicy down there.
00:02:02.875,00:02:08.375,"Shit, I figured you were like 30, maybe even 35, but 40?"
00:02:09.000,00:02:11.041,"Damn, that's just... that's just crazy."
00:02:20.583,00:02:24.625,she's like fruit from the tree that falls to the ground for the bugs to eat.
00:02:26.750,00:02:28.375,Now 70?
00:02:28.458,00:02:31.458,Call me when you turn 70 and can't control your bowels.
00:02:35.000,00:02:36.166,"Oh, God."
00:02:38.500,00:02:41.000,"Wait. Oh, come on."
00:02:41.458,00:02:43.625,"Come on, sir, you see me standing right here."
00:02:43.708,00:02:45.333,Please? I'm late.
00:02:50.208,00:02:51.833,You just made your mother proud.
00:02:52.416,00:02:53.500,My mother's dead.
00:03:00.083,00:03:01.458,Sorry?
00:03:02.458,00:03:03.666,Okay. Sorry.
00:03:10.041,00:03:12.458,Excuse me. Sorry about that. Sorry.
00:03:14.583,00:03:18.791,"It's been a year, so don't you think we should take care of Mom's apartment?"
00:03:19.625,00:03:20.916,"Aight, hit me back."
00:03:24.541,00:03:25.375,Thank you.
00:03:27.333,00:03:28.500,"Oh, great."
00:03:35.750,00:03:37.125,"Oh, fuck me."
00:03:42.750,00:03:43.625,Great.
00:03:44.750,00:03:45.625,Great.
00:03:49.916,00:03:51.291,"Excuse me, sir?"
00:03:52.000,00:03:57.125,"Sir? Sir? Do you think I could just, like, jump out before you let the people in."
00:03:57.208,00:04:05.500,"I'm really late. I'll just jump out before you-- Sorry for the delay, folks, but this lady here doesn't want me to help the disabled people on."
00:04:07.416,00:04:09.541,I... Wow. That did not...
00:04:09.625,00:04:11.041,I didn't... I didn't say that.
00:04:11.125,00:04:13.458,"But, no, please. As you were."
00:04:13.541,00:04:15.708,Thanks. Thanks a lot. Please.
00:04:18.875,00:04:20.000,No!
00:04:22.833,00:05:01.708,"Your stingy-ass ways mean we can't flow And you bullshit Libra Fucking deceiver Step off, Gigantor No one believes you And Mr. Gemini You're too feminine Can't rock with a nigga's ass Bigger than mine See me? I'm focused My sweet mid-body lust Is just for those who I trust Why? Because I'm a cli-cli-cli-Taurus Wow."
00:05:03.166,00:05:04.041,Wow.
00:05:04.625,00:05:07.083,"Come on, guys. Come on. Clap it up for Elaine."
00:05:07.958,00:05:09.083,Thank you.
00:05:11.791,00:05:14.833,"Thank you. Thank you for sharing that, Elaine, really."
00:05:15.333,00:05:16.666,"Okay, um..."
00:05:17.333,00:05:21.375,Any more thought on what kind of play we want to write?
00:05:21.458,00:05:22.291,Rosa?
00:05:22.791,00:05:24.708,I say we do some sci-fi shit.
00:05:25.208,00:05:26.041,Like?
00:05:26.583,00:05:31.291,"Like this strange blue cloud comes down from the sky raining on everybody, right?"
00:05:31.375,00:05:36.375,"But then the next day, every man caught in the rain, they wake up with no dick."
00:05:41.833,00:05:43.333,-Yeah. -Okay.
00:05:43.416,00:05:50.958,"No, no, no. We should do some racial-type political shit, where a Black man fucks this white girl and dies."
00:05:52.500,00:05:55.125,And that's political because...
00:05:55.208,00:05:59.625,'Cause a white vagina is a plot to destroy a Black family.
00:05:59.708,00:06:02.958,"Shit, my mom would kill me if I even touch one, you feel me?"
00:06:03.041,00:06:04.458,"Consider yourself dead, bro."
00:06:05.166,00:06:06.833,"Mm, mm-mm-mm."
00:06:06.916,00:06:11.833,"Okay, guys, can we come up with ideas that don't involve genitalia?"
00:06:11.916,00:06:16.125,"You know, just in case somebody's grandmother wants to come to the show."
00:06:16.208,00:06:18.625,For what? My abuela loves balls.
00:06:19.750,00:06:23.166,"Ha, ha, ha. Very funny. Okay, that's fine."
00:06:23.250,00:06:26.166,"Make jokes. Just remember, it's your play."
00:06:26.791,00:06:28.625,It'll be whatever you put into it.
00:06:28.708,00:06:30.916,"If you put in nothing, it'll be nothing."
00:06:31.000,00:06:32.208,Like your career?
00:06:36.375,00:06:37.250,Ouch.
00:06:38.416,00:06:39.375,"Really, Elaine?"
00:06:39.458,00:06:41.041,I googled you.
00:06:41.125,00:06:44.000,"Last time you did anything was, what, 2010?"
00:06:44.083,00:06:48.375,"Oh, 2012, and they ain't producing her 'cause white people scared of the truth."
00:06:48.458,00:06:49.500,"Right, Miss B?"
00:06:49.583,00:06:51.791,"Rosa, thank you, but it's not about me."
00:06:51.875,00:06:55.208,"Right, Brosa, so stop kissing her ass. You ain't going down on her."
00:06:55.291,00:06:57.375,Fuck you. I could dream.
00:06:57.458,00:07:00.333,"Damn, Elaine. Why you gotta be so negative?"
00:07:00.416,00:07:01.416,I'm saying...
00:07:01.500,00:07:05.166,how's somebody who ain't had no real hit gonna tell me how to write a fucking play?
00:07:07.041,00:07:08.708,I actually appreciate that. Thank you.
00:07:08.791,00:07:12.750,"And that's why she's teaching at the school, coming late every day when nobody wants to be here."
00:07:14.666,00:07:19.541,"I told you there were 20 invalids on my bus today, okay?"
00:07:19.625,00:07:22.125,"But you know what, Elaine? This isn't Dangerous Minds."
00:07:22.208,00:07:24.250,You can leave whenever you want.
00:07:24.333,00:07:28.041,"And, by the way, I actually have a production coming up. Thank you."
00:07:30.833,00:07:32.583,I'm just saying.
00:07:39.333,00:07:41.375,"Yo, Elaine, sit down."
00:07:42.333,00:07:44.416,"-What'd you say? -Uh, Rosa, don't bother."
00:07:44.500,00:07:47.791,"I said sit your disrespectful ass down. Now, puta."
00:07:47.875,00:07:49.500,-What? -Oh shit!
00:07:49.583,00:07:50.708,Oh! Ooh-hoo-hoo!
00:07:53.583,00:07:57.333,"Okay? Now, girls... I mean, gender non-conformists."
00:07:57.416,00:07:59.416,"Make me sit down, dyke."
00:08:01.583,00:08:03.958,"Guys, can we just calm down and make art please?"
00:08:04.041,00:08:06.416,'Cause you look like Bustin' Bieber I'm supposed to be scared?
00:08:08.125,00:08:09.583,"You still a bitch, bitch."
00:08:12.125,00:08:13.083,Oh shit!
00:08:15.125,00:08:16.208,Pop her titty out!
00:08:17.916,00:08:18.916,"Guys, come on!"
00:08:26.708,00:08:27.958,Ya'll break it up!
00:08:31.041,00:08:32.166,Boo!
00:08:33.958,00:08:35.583,Fuck Time Out New York!
00:08:35.666,00:08:37.583,"You're five stars Black Shakespeare, ma!"
00:08:37.666,00:08:41.750,"Like RadhaMUSprime, you'll rise again to slay all these Decepticunts out here!"
00:08:42.666,00:08:44.416,"-Oh, my God. -You all right?"
00:08:44.500,00:08:46.125,-Yes. -You good?
00:08:46.208,00:08:47.333,Yeah.
00:08:47.416,00:08:48.416,Oh my God.
00:08:55.875,00:08:58.125,-Do the thing! Ciao! -Great.
00:09:00.708,00:09:04.083,I'm either gonna kill or fuck one of these damn kids.
00:09:04.166,00:09:07.291,"Archie, where's my regional production? Like, what do I gotta do?"
00:09:07.375,00:09:11.000,Write a... slave musical? An all-white play?
00:09:11.875,00:09:14.041,"Like, who do I have to blow around here?"
00:09:14.125,00:09:15.125,Elaine.
00:09:15.750,00:09:19.083,"Oh, hey, Avery. What?"
00:09:19.166,00:09:22.583,Elaine probably would have chilled if you just complimented her stupid poem.
00:09:23.750,00:09:24.666,You're right.
00:09:26.208,00:09:28.208,"Oh, why you drinking that diet shit?"
00:09:28.791,00:09:30.166,I prefer my woman thick.
00:09:33.708,00:09:36.583,"Avery, that's not appropriate."
00:09:37.083,00:09:38.375,I'm-- I'm your teacher.
00:09:40.125,00:09:41.583,I turn 20 in two weeks.
00:09:43.708,00:09:44.625,I bet you do.
00:09:45.375,00:09:46.333,All over.
00:09:48.166,00:09:50.791,"Help me. Please, help me."
00:09:57.583,00:09:59.750,I felt my balls shrivel up.
00:10:01.541,00:10:02.916,When I got that call...
00:10:04.000,00:10:09.000,"I thought, Damn, Darlene, that's fucked up."
00:10:15.750,00:10:16.625,I need a minute.
00:10:19.291,00:10:20.750,"Come on, man."
00:10:45.291,00:10:47.791,Smells great. Smells really good.
00:10:49.458,00:10:50.291,Um...
00:10:55.125,00:11:00.208,"I, uh, wanted to talk to you about my workshop production with you."
00:11:00.291,00:11:02.833,YOUmoja Theater. Yeah.
00:11:03.500,00:11:04.833,"It's true, uh..."
00:11:04.916,00:11:10.875,"Black theater spaces are often under-resourced and underfunded, but it's..."
00:11:13.291,00:11:16.083,it's important that...
00:11:18.458,00:11:20.125,that I work with my people.
00:11:20.875,00:11:27.541,"Still, my agent thinks that, um, at this point in my career, you know, I've done the 30 Under 30..."
00:11:27.625,00:11:30.958,"Yes, it was quite a couple years ago, but I-- I did win that award."
00:11:31.041,00:11:39.375,"He feels that I should maybe have a regional production of the play, instead of a workshop production."
00:11:39.458,00:11:45.916,"And, uh, for a fee that, I don't know, is enough to pay my rent would be nice."
00:11:47.375,00:11:48.208,Maybe.
00:11:48.791,00:11:50.625,Ooh. Okay.
00:11:59.666,00:12:00.541,Okay.
00:12:12.333,00:12:13.166,"Oh, I should..."
00:12:29.625,00:12:32.291,"always watching, I trust them."
00:12:32.375,00:12:38.000,"They told me, despite the numerous challenges, that I must preserve this theater."
00:12:38.083,00:12:45.166,"And now, they're reminding me that what we create here is imbued with a spirit of cause."
00:12:45.250,00:12:46.125,Yes.
00:12:46.916,00:12:48.166,Not commerce.
00:12:53.083,00:12:54.291,The ancestors said that?
00:12:56.583,00:12:58.250,They don't want my rent paid?
00:13:02.041,00:13:05.791,"So, I have an Aunt Karen and I know she wants my rent paid."
00:13:05.875,00:13:07.583,"No? Okay, I'll just back off."
00:13:14.958,00:13:17.000,Antonio picked out our matching thongs.
00:13:17.083,00:13:19.291,"Anyway, meet me downtown in, like, an hour."
00:13:19.375,00:13:22.958,There's someone I want you to meet. Could be a game changer.
00:13:23.583,00:13:24.875,"Oh, and be on time!"
00:13:25.750,00:13:27.625,"Hey, you have the address, right?"
00:13:27.708,00:13:29.583,"Okay, please dress it up a bit."
00:13:29.666,00:13:30.666,See you in a few.
00:13:34.625,00:13:37.958,"Maybe you'll finally get a nigga to go home with you tonight, huh?"
00:13:38.916,00:13:41.666,It's been a long time since you had somebody up there.
00:13:41.750,00:13:47.416,"-And by up there, I mean up in there! -Yeah, got it."
00:13:55.416,00:13:57.708,"Come on, you can tell me."
00:13:58.458,00:14:00.458,"-Okay, but not a word. -No."
00:14:08.375,00:14:11.291,My God! August Wilson? Timeless.
00:14:14.000,00:14:16.083,"Oh, no, I don't want those at all."
00:14:16.166,00:14:18.791,-Tempted? -No! Mm-mm.
00:14:19.541,00:14:22.458,"I'm gonna lose 40 by 40. I'm doing smoothies, boo."
00:14:22.541,00:14:24.875,"Oh, that's why your breath, uh..."
00:14:27.291,00:14:29.125,So there may be an opportunity.
00:14:30.958,00:14:33.708,To drown in a sea of old white women?
00:14:33.791,00:14:35.125,Beyond the ladies.
00:14:37.958,00:14:39.750,-That's J. Whitman. -I know.
00:14:40.875,00:14:43.291,Why would I care about J. Whitman?
00:14:43.791,00:14:49.208,"In between drinks and trying to grope my ass, he said they have a last minute slot to fill."
00:14:49.291,00:14:50.125,And?
00:14:50.208,00:14:52.791,And it might be a chance to get your play up.
00:14:53.208,00:14:56.666,You know women of color playwrights are very hot right now.
00:14:58.166,00:15:01.166,Or would you rather have the roof leaking on your production at YOUmoja?
00:15:01.250,00:15:05.500,J. Whitman only does Black poverty porn plays of which mine are not.
00:15:05.583,00:15:11.208,"Great, so I stopped masturbating, got dressed, and resisted those succulent ribs for nothing?"
00:15:11.791,00:15:13.625,Didn't someone almost stab you today?
00:15:13.708,00:15:14.541,No!
00:15:15.458,00:15:17.083,I was vigorously pushed.
00:15:17.166,00:15:18.291,"They're good kids, okay?"
00:15:20.791,00:15:27.958,I'd rather do a workshop production with Forrest and his stingy-ass ancestors than suck it up to J. Whitman. Ugh!
00:15:28.583,00:15:34.041,"Look, I let that man graze my ass, so you're going to ingest a breath mint and go see what that man has to say."
00:15:37.416,00:15:38.958,-I know you're not trying-- -Mm!
00:15:54.833,00:16:05.833,"Our all-female production of 12 Angry Men, my idea, I'm sorry, but I draw the line at fresh cow shit."
00:16:07.083,00:16:09.041,"Radha! Excuse me, ladies."
00:16:09.125,00:16:11.916,-Radha! Hey! -How are you?
00:16:12.000,00:16:14.375,"Just puckering up to the patrons, as usual."
00:16:14.458,00:16:16.000,-How are you? -Good.
00:16:16.083,00:16:18.375,Archie tells me you're teaching.
00:16:18.458,00:16:20.625,I've been teaching for a while now.
00:16:20.708,00:16:22.750,"Well, theater misses you."
00:16:22.833,00:16:24.208,-Does it? -Mm-hmm.
00:16:24.291,00:16:27.083,Is it looking for me? Because I've been here.
00:16:27.166,00:16:29.791,"Now, Archie insisted I read your play."
00:16:29.875,00:16:30.916,Awesome. Thank you.
00:16:31.000,00:16:32.125,It's...
00:16:33.000,00:16:34.916,Yes...?
00:16:35.000,00:16:37.708,Why don't you tell me about it in your own words?
00:16:38.291,00:16:39.250,Okay.
00:16:39.333,00:16:40.250,Um...
00:16:40.750,00:16:54.458,"Harlem Ave is about a young Black man who inherits a grocery store from his dead mom and pop, and how he struggles to keep the business afloat with the help of his lovely wife..."
00:16:55.250,00:16:56.333,who's an activist.
00:16:58.625,00:16:59.500,Hmm.
00:17:00.458,00:17:01.291,That's it?
00:17:02.041,00:17:04.250,"No. No, no, no."
00:17:04.333,00:17:07.166,It's about gentrification. Mm.
00:17:07.250,00:17:13.416,And how this young couple struggles to-- -You didn't like it. -The idea is powerful.
00:17:13.500,00:17:14.500,But?
00:17:14.583,00:17:17.291,It rang a little inauthentic.
00:17:18.416,00:17:21.375,"Okay. Well, thank you for that note. I appreciate it."
00:17:24.833,00:17:26.958,I just wish you hadn't shied away from darkness.
00:17:27.041,00:17:31.791,"I mean if you're going to call it Harlem Ave, you gotta give me Harlem Ave."
00:17:31.875,00:17:35.083,I should write in a teen mother shooting up in an alley.
00:17:35.166,00:17:36.375,"No, no, no!"
00:17:37.666,00:17:39.750,"-No. No, you're missing my point. -Yeah, no."
00:17:39.833,00:17:42.083,I'm talking about gentrification.
00:17:42.166,00:17:48.583,"A Black Harlem shifting under a white hipster land grab, but your play never goes there."
00:17:48.666,00:17:51.791,"I ask myself, Did a Black person really write this?"
00:17:56.000,00:17:58.458,"-Now, look, look, sweetheart. -Yes."
00:17:58.541,00:18:02.041,There's definitely a voice under all those words.
00:18:02.125,00:18:05.291,-All those words. -But the writing needs work.
00:18:05.791,00:18:07.791,-The good news is... -Hmm?
00:18:08.583,00:18:11.875,I still need a writer for my Harriet Tubman musical.
00:18:21.791,00:18:22.916,Okay.
00:18:25.791,00:18:28.833,That's... that's great.
00:18:31.166,00:18:32.125,That's great.
00:18:38.875,00:18:40.208,Fuck.
00:18:53.333,00:18:55.166,"Mommy, please."
00:18:56.708,00:18:59.208,"Mommy, please. Tell me what to do."
00:19:22.625,00:19:29.791,"Oh, shit, there it go Right next to belly bloating And this spotty flow Yo, where my damn house keys?"
00:19:29.875,00:19:31.500,Why my lower legs hurt?
00:19:31.583,00:19:36.583,"Sciatica, locked legs like Attica Word, yo, why my ass always horny?"
00:19:36.666,00:19:38.375,Why I always gotta pee?
00:19:38.458,00:19:41.333,Why the young boy on the bus Offer his seat to me?
00:19:41.416,00:19:43.125,Why my skin so dry?
00:19:43.208,00:19:44.833,Why am I yawning right now?
00:19:44.916,00:19:48.041,Why them AARP niggas Sending shit to my house?
00:19:48.125,00:19:50.125,Why my ass so impatient?
00:19:50.208,00:19:58.583,But I like them young bucks But ten o'clock roll around And I'm too tired to fuck Why my knees be writing checks That my back can't cash?
00:19:58.666,00:20:01.791,Why I think I'm gonna fart But my ass got other plans?
00:20:01.875,00:20:05.208,"Why most hip hop got me feeling So much older, yo?"
00:20:05.291,00:20:08.041,When the fuck is this loud-ass song Gon' be over?
00:20:08.125,00:20:14.333,"Yeah, I tried to dance hard But my knees straight caught me Cause, yo, this is 40, niggas!"
00:20:14.416,00:20:15.791,This is 40!
00:21:01.625,00:21:03.000,Oh! Uh...
00:21:04.541,00:21:05.375,Damn.
00:21:05.458,00:21:08.458,"Antonio, just pick out a villa on the beach and I'll cover it, okay?"
00:21:08.583,00:21:10.250,"I can't, I'm meeting Radha."
00:21:10.333,00:21:14.541,"She's still very fragile, very Miss Sofia after jail, you know?"
00:21:14.625,00:21:16.041,She needs some cheering up.
00:21:16.125,00:21:17.083,Hey.
00:21:17.166,00:21:20.666,"Oh, my Unabomber realness. Okay, baby, I'll call you back. Bye."
00:21:21.208,00:21:23.625,-Come here! Hey! -Hey. Hey.
00:21:23.708,00:21:25.125,How are you?
00:21:25.208,00:21:28.291,"I'm okay, I'm okay, but listen, I need to talk to you about something."
00:21:28.375,00:21:31.416,"-Me, too. So, last night-- -Last night was crazy."
00:21:31.500,00:21:33.708,-Something happened after-- -Don't worry about it.
00:21:33.791,00:21:35.583,"-I know, but something happened after-- -Listen!"
00:21:35.666,00:21:38.666,"Radha, I think there's a way to smooth things over with Whitman."
00:21:38.750,00:21:43.041,If we can just-- What?
00:21:43.125,00:22:10.708,"A skinny white dude with the fattest ass Yo, he was standing with his Becky When her eyes met mine She looked away like she was shamed, G They must have had a real love Or that bitch had a fetish For some Black girl butt But a butt But a butt painted white Connected to this pink ding-a-ling It made me sing White man with a Black woman's butt How you carry all that back there?"
00:22:10.791,00:22:12.916,What the fuck?
00:22:14.333,00:22:15.833,"Yes, what the fuck?"
00:22:15.916,00:22:19.083,"-Look, just... just think about it. -What? Think about what?"
00:22:19.166,00:22:20.875,What are you talking about?
00:22:20.958,00:22:23.083,Think about me doing hip-hop.
00:22:23.666,00:22:24.750,Doing what to it?
00:22:25.291,00:22:26.583,I want to make a mixtape.
00:22:27.125,00:22:28.541,About a white man's ass?
00:22:28.625,00:22:31.625,"No, about the 40-year-old woman's point of view."
00:22:31.708,00:22:33.916,"Dry vag, soupy tits. Am I missing something?"
00:22:34.000,00:22:37.041,"Archie, where did I spend most of my time in high school?"
00:22:37.125,00:22:38.250,With your regrets.
00:22:38.791,00:22:45.875,"No, I was in the cafeteria, beating out beats on the table, rhyming all day, all night."
00:22:45.958,00:22:47.875,All of my composition books filled with rhymes.
00:22:47.958,00:22:52.041,You used to charge people to battle me because I was the best MC in high school.
00:22:52.125,00:22:54.625,"Honey, we are not in high school. We are almost 40."
00:22:55.166,00:22:56.041,So?
00:22:56.125,00:22:59.041,So... So that means I can't make great music?
00:22:59.125,00:23:03.625,"I can make real music, not the bullshit that my students listen to, but real music."
00:23:03.708,00:23:08.708,I found this Brownsville DJ-producer on Instagram.
00:23:08.791,00:23:09.833,"Oh, my Jesus."
00:23:09.916,00:23:12.375,His name is D. He doesn't take calls.
00:23:12.458,00:23:17.541,"I think you just show up with a bag of weed or something, but anyway, his beats..."
00:23:19.333,00:23:22.333,"-Come on, Archie! -Okay, yeah. Radha. Radha."
00:23:22.958,00:23:24.291,Last night we had a bad moment.
00:23:24.375,00:23:26.416,"See, this is about creating something that is mine."
00:23:26.500,00:23:28.125,And now we're having a little breakdown.
00:23:28.208,00:23:31.583,Something that doesn't rely on critics or gatekeepers.
00:23:31.666,00:23:33.333,Or choking out a white man?
00:23:35.375,00:23:37.958,Do you smell the burning carcass of friendship?
00:23:38.041,00:23:39.458,"Yeah, I definitely smell it."
00:23:39.541,00:23:41.458,"Radha, look, I get it."
00:23:41.541,00:23:43.375,Your... Your mom's gone.
00:23:44.041,00:23:46.125,"You're a little sad, a little stuck."
00:23:46.208,00:23:47.208,A lot of eating.
00:23:47.750,00:23:50.666,"You're in mourning, but you're not done with theater."
00:23:51.291,00:23:54.750,"What, so there's a 40 under 40 list that I don't know about?"
00:23:57.458,00:24:01.875,"Okay, look, you make your little music, if that's what you need to do."
00:24:01.958,00:24:03.041,Thank you. I appreciate it.
00:24:03.125,00:24:07.791,"In the meantime, I will smooth things over with Whitman, and you can tighten up your script. Okay?"
00:24:07.875,00:24:09.041,"-Oh, my God. -Hello?"
00:24:17.041,00:24:31.208,"They call that an omen, ho-may Sorry to say, boo-bae Hip hop. Hippity hop."
00:24:35.333,00:24:36.666,Really?
00:24:36.750,00:24:44.750,We sisters finally got a Michelle Obama out here and you want to go do this ri-damn-diculousness?
00:24:47.041,00:24:48.166,Hear that?
00:24:48.250,00:24:51.250,Harriet Tubman just shot herself in the afterlife.
00:24:51.333,00:24:53.166,Mm! Mm-mm-mm.
00:24:59.291,00:25:01.333,"but there's a lot of stuff, yo."
00:25:01.416,00:25:02.791,When you coming by?
00:25:04.000,00:25:05.958,A bunch of your shit is still over there.
00:25:06.916,00:25:08.333,"Aight, hit me."
00:25:09.333,00:25:10.166,Later.
00:25:37.875,00:25:38.833,Is D here?
00:26:13.833,00:26:15.041,"Hey, yo, mama, what you need?"
00:26:16.666,00:26:18.500,Beats. Tracks.
00:26:19.708,00:26:20.583,For what?
00:26:21.666,00:26:22.541,For me.
00:26:23.708,00:26:24.875,"What, you rhyme?"
00:26:29.208,00:26:33.291,"Oh, and, uh, yes, I have currency."
00:26:33.375,00:26:34.791,"Oh, aight."
00:26:34.875,00:26:36.708,No doubt. So what you call yourself?
00:26:36.791,00:26:38.750,"-Huh? -So, what they call you?"
00:26:38.833,00:26:43.833,-What they call you? -Radha... MUSprime.
00:26:45.458,00:26:46.291,What?
00:26:46.375,00:26:47.958,RadhaMUSprime.
00:26:48.041,00:26:51.250,"Oh, shit, like, uh, like Optimus. -Yeah. Yeah."
00:26:52.625,00:26:54.083,"Yeah. Yeah, aight."
00:26:54.166,00:26:55.958,"Yeah, that's me. Yeah."
00:26:56.708,00:26:57.791,"Hey, yo, D."
00:26:59.208,00:27:00.291,"Yo, D!"
00:27:00.958,00:27:02.125,"Yo, this is RadhaMUSprime."
00:27:03.083,00:27:04.375,"She needs some beats, yo."
00:27:14.916,00:27:16.750,"Gosh, your poor feet."
00:27:37.083,00:27:38.083,I'm good.
00:27:52.125,00:27:53.000,"Oh, shit."
00:27:54.541,00:27:56.208,"Shit, what time is it?"
00:27:56.291,00:27:57.125,Two.
00:27:58.458,00:27:59.291,A.M.?
00:28:01.250,00:28:02.125,Where's D?
00:28:03.291,00:28:04.125,Gone.
00:28:05.041,00:28:06.041,Where?
00:28:18.083,00:28:20.791,Stupid fucking door. Shit.
00:28:21.875,00:28:23.791,I came all the way to Brooklyn for this bullshit?
00:28:24.375,00:28:25.208,Fuck.
00:28:31.000,00:28:35.250,Say what you have been meaning to say to me from the moment that you first laid eyes on me.
00:28:39.166,00:28:41.416,I love red meat.
00:28:43.666,00:28:46.958,"-Congrats, Josh, it's your next hit. -I try."
00:28:47.500,00:28:48.791,You look great.
00:28:48.875,00:28:51.166,Considering my neck was in a vice last week.
00:28:51.250,00:28:53.458,"Again, I'm so sorry."
00:28:53.541,00:28:55.083,Can I help you with something?
00:28:55.625,00:28:57.916,I want to thank you for not pressing charges.
00:28:58.000,00:29:00.583,"Well, it wasn't that tight a grip."
00:29:00.666,00:29:01.500,Pilates.
00:29:02.458,00:29:03.958,I appreciate your loyalty.
00:29:04.041,00:29:06.166,"I don't quite understand the attachment, though."
00:29:08.083,00:29:10.958,-She has a real voice. -She's good. She's not special.
00:29:11.541,00:29:12.708,That's bullshit.
00:29:15.916,00:29:16.958,Seriously.
00:29:18.041,00:29:20.583,Begging doesn't suit your lovely cheekbones.
00:29:23.083,00:29:28.291,"You should be producing theater, not letting some washed-up writer weigh you down."
00:29:29.916,00:29:31.875,-But if you could just reconsider-- -Sorry.
00:29:33.750,00:29:35.125,There's nothing else to say.
00:29:43.166,00:29:45.583,"Boom. So, right, the sperm."
00:29:45.666,00:29:49.416,"He gotta go through all these different portals and shit, like parts of the vagina, the chocha..."
00:29:49.500,00:29:55.750,"But at each portal, he gotta fight mad assault ninjas, like a crab ninja because, you know, bitch had crabs once."
00:29:56.666,00:29:58.916,-We should write in a tampon ninja. -You're right.
00:29:59.000,00:30:05.083,"Anyway, so, right, after all these trials, he finally gets to Vagzilla, the Queen of the Vaginal Eggs."
00:30:05.166,00:30:07.250,"I prefer Eggliza though, brother."
00:30:07.333,00:30:09.375,"Same shit. Now, right?"
00:30:10.333,00:30:16.000,"The queen, she all fine and shit, but Old Spermy, he gotta seduce her and shit, so he could..."
00:30:22.208,00:30:23.916,What you... what you thinking?
00:30:26.458,00:30:27.583,"Sure, why not?"
00:30:27.666,00:30:28.500,What?
00:30:30.666,00:30:32.416,-I already told you. -Um...
00:30:32.500,00:30:34.291,"Guys, let's pick up next week."
00:30:34.375,00:30:37.166,You tight. You tight. You tight. You dead tight.
00:30:39.625,00:30:41.458,"Yeah. I see you, Avery."
00:30:41.541,00:30:43.541,"Uh, Rosa, Elaine?"
00:30:44.208,00:30:45.500,"What up, Miss B?"
00:30:45.583,00:30:47.875,"Uh, don't Miss B me, okay?"
00:30:49.250,00:30:53.208,"Now, the dean said I could kick the both of you out of the class after what happened last week."
00:30:55.083,00:30:56.791,But I won't. Why?
00:30:56.875,00:31:00.916,Because even though we'd all rather be someplace other than this terribly lit room...
00:31:01.000,00:31:01.833,Not me.
00:31:01.916,00:31:06.750,"...we committed to telling a story, and not some version of poverty porn, either, okay?"
00:31:06.833,00:31:11.250,"So, don't think if you don't get what you want, Elaine, that the world should stop for you."
00:31:11.333,00:31:12.791,"Mm, I like this, Miss B."
00:31:12.875,00:31:17.083,"Or that if someone says something you don't like, Rosa, you get to choke them the fuck out."
00:31:17.166,00:31:18.791,"You're right, my bad."
00:31:19.791,00:31:23.541,"Now, Elaine, your poem was great. Okay?"
00:31:24.458,00:31:25.291,Yeah?
00:31:25.833,00:31:26.916,Yes!
00:31:27.625,00:31:28.458,But...
00:31:28.958,00:31:33.666,"don't think because you created something that people would appreciate it, okay?"
00:31:33.750,00:31:43.833,"Or you'll end up some washed-up, forty-year-old playwright with some stupid notion to become a rapper and the shits from drinking a diet drink that doesn't quite meet the FDA standards."
00:31:43.916,00:31:45.958,"Now, do you want that for yourselves?"
00:31:46.083,00:31:47.791,"I said, Is that what you want?"
00:31:47.875,00:31:48.833,-No. -No.
00:31:49.958,00:31:50.791,Fine.
00:31:50.875,00:31:52.041,"A rapper, Miss B?"
00:31:52.916,00:31:54.166,I'll see you next week.
00:31:56.541,00:32:00.666,"Wow, she's like Queen Latifah and Judge Judy, but rolled into one, yo."
00:32:08.750,00:32:10.333,"-What the fuck? -Yo, Miss B."
00:32:11.625,00:32:13.083,"Hey, Avery."
00:32:18.458,00:32:20.250,"Oh, sweet Jesus."
00:32:20.333,00:32:22.333,"Yes, I am your salvation."
00:32:24.416,00:32:26.916,"So, I just saw Whitman. His new play is trash."
00:32:27.000,00:32:29.000,"Anyway, your name came up."
00:32:30.250,00:32:33.541,"So, I told him straight up, like, What's up with my girl, you know?"
00:32:34.583,00:32:36.416,"-And he said-- -Wait, hold up, Archie."
00:32:36.500,00:32:38.333,"Uh, hello? Radha?"
00:32:39.208,00:32:40.333,Hello?
00:32:41.041,00:32:42.583,This motherfucker.
00:32:43.291,00:32:44.166,Excuse me?
00:32:44.250,00:32:45.666,Mm!
00:32:46.208,00:32:48.333,"-Hey, Archie, let me call you back. -No, wait!"
00:32:48.916,00:32:49.875,Fuck!
00:32:51.166,00:32:53.166,"No, not you. I'd never fuck you."
00:32:57.541,00:33:05.250,"The storage people are ready to pick up stuff, but I waited... because maybe you want to look through her stuff first?"
00:33:06.166,00:33:09.083,Come on! What's the fucking deal?
00:33:18.666,00:33:19.541,Hey.
00:33:20.708,00:33:23.541,"Look, um, I don't know you..."
00:33:24.291,00:33:30.666,"and you damn sure don't know me to pull some ghosting shit like you did, but, um, nigga, I'm from Brooklyn too."
00:33:30.750,00:33:35.625,Okay? I grew up on Mother Gaston in the '90s.
00:33:35.708,00:33:46.666,"By aroma alone, I can tell the difference between three grades of crack, so don't go treating me like I'm some white, newbie hipster exploring the Black terrain when I'm fucking from here, okay?"
00:33:58.416,00:34:00.250,This motherfucker.
00:34:16.000,00:34:19.125,"If you didn't want to work with me, you should have just said something."
00:34:24.416,00:34:26.208,You know what's really fucked up?
00:34:26.791,00:34:33.166,All you so-called brothers letting a sister walk to a Brownsville train station by herself at 2:00 a.m. in the morning.
00:34:34.708,00:34:36.125,Does that even sound right?
00:34:39.541,00:34:41.041,"No, it don't."
00:34:42.083,00:34:42.916,Okay.
00:34:44.208,00:34:45.375,"It was, like, 2:10."
00:34:46.375,00:34:48.583,You went to the corner bodega and got some Funyuns.
00:34:48.666,00:34:51.541,"You went down to the station. Your train came in, like, ten minutes."
00:34:59.166,00:35:00.125,I knew that.
00:35:02.041,00:35:03.125,You going in or what?
00:35:04.625,00:35:05.541,"What, now?"
00:35:06.250,00:35:07.750,Did you want another beat?
00:35:09.583,00:35:10.416,Maybe.
00:35:37.916,00:35:39.750,"No, wait. The last one."
00:35:50.958,00:35:52.041,I'm so sorry.
00:35:58.833,00:36:09.875,"I've been working on this... social commentary about, um, the white gaze's eroticism of Black pain, and, um..."
00:36:13.875,00:36:15.875,Don't you want to know what I'm rhyming about?
00:36:17.083,00:36:18.583,"I just make the beats, lady."
00:36:46.583,00:36:49.625,"Aight, so, you gonna come in..."
00:36:51.666,00:36:53.208,You gonna come in on the eight.
00:38:24.500,00:38:25.666,How was that last one?
00:38:27.041,00:38:27.958,Good.
00:38:34.000,00:38:35.500,If my kids could see me now.
00:38:39.291,00:38:40.666,"Not my kids, I don't..."
00:38:41.458,00:38:42.416,I don't have kids.
00:38:47.333,00:38:48.500,I'm a teacher.
00:38:48.583,00:38:50.000,I teach playwriting.
00:38:51.916,00:38:55.000,"I'm a playwright, but I don't really feel like one these days."
00:38:56.291,00:38:59.166,"Anyway, my students would get a real kick out of this."
00:38:59.250,00:39:02.791,Not that you're listening to anything I'm saying.
00:39:14.750,00:39:15.916,"Coltrane, huh?"
00:39:17.541,00:39:19.875,"What, I'm from Brownsville, so I don't know?"
00:39:20.833,00:39:22.875,"No, I'm just saying, Coltrane."
00:39:24.125,00:39:26.041,"Yeah, my moms put me on."
00:39:26.125,00:39:27.041,Hmm.
00:39:28.583,00:39:30.166,Your mom has good taste.
00:39:34.000,00:39:36.458,"So, what does she think of your music?"
00:39:38.833,00:39:40.458,I don't know. She died.
00:39:52.958,00:39:54.250,I'm sorry to hear that.
00:40:00.000,00:40:01.541,You know what? Um...
00:40:02.791,00:40:03.791,I'm gonna go.
00:40:05.875,00:40:08.833,The session was great. I just should probably get on my way.
00:40:11.500,00:40:14.125,"Um, but before I forget."
00:40:18.416,00:40:20.583,Don't I owe you for the session?
00:40:20.666,00:40:22.583,"No, we good from last time. It's cool."
00:40:23.333,00:40:24.291,Okay.
00:40:28.041,00:40:29.833,Okay.
00:40:29.916,00:40:32.000,"Um, oh, you need me to..."
00:40:36.583,00:40:41.750,"Uh, no, but, um... I want to come back."
00:40:43.708,00:40:45.708,I want to make a mixtape.
00:40:48.333,00:40:49.666,-Man. -What?
00:40:50.791,00:40:52.500,Nothing. I mean...
00:40:53.041,00:40:55.458,you could. It'd be nice.
00:40:56.708,00:40:57.833,What did you just say?
00:40:58.750,00:41:00.750,"Come on, you heard what I said."
00:41:02.416,00:41:05.083,You don't think I'm some crazy old broad for doing this?
00:41:05.791,00:41:07.666,"I mean, I ain't say all that..."
00:41:08.500,00:41:10.500,but what you're doing...
00:41:11.916,00:41:12.916,it's interesting.
00:41:15.250,00:41:16.083,"Thanks, D."
00:41:20.416,00:41:21.750,"Yeah, thanks."
00:41:28.250,00:41:29.625,What you doing on Thursday?
00:41:36.666,00:41:38.041,"Yeah, bitch."
00:41:39.916,00:41:41.625,I was just about to call you.
00:41:41.708,00:41:46.625,You got me waiting in your not-gentrified-enough-for-me part of Harlem getting harassed by Homeless Harry over there.
00:41:46.708,00:41:49.250,"It's Lamont, but okay."
00:41:49.333,00:41:51.250,"-Look, I want-- -No, you look."
00:41:51.333,00:41:56.375,"You're blowing me off when I'm trying to tell your tired, unproduced ass some good news."
00:41:56.458,00:41:57.333,What?
00:41:58.125,00:42:00.625,Harlem fucking Ave.
00:42:01.500,00:42:03.250,Whitman wants to produce it.
00:42:03.333,00:42:04.291,What?
00:42:04.375,00:42:10.875,"He said he's over the thing and wants to do your play, pending we make some changes around length and tone and did I say length?"
00:42:10.958,00:42:13.333,Doesn't matter. He's all in.
00:42:13.416,00:42:14.708,Mm...
00:42:15.250,00:42:16.416,-What? -I don't know.
00:42:16.500,00:42:18.791,Does that... does this even feel right?
00:42:18.875,00:42:21.041,Does an after-dinner fart feel right? Hell's yes.
00:42:21.125,00:42:22.583,"No, I mean..."
00:42:23.333,00:42:27.458,do I want to compromise my play for some arrogant asshole?
00:42:28.166,00:42:30.500,-You choked that asshole. -Shh.
00:42:30.583,00:42:32.750,That asshole didn't press charges.
00:42:32.833,00:42:36.166,That asshole still wants to work with you.
00:42:37.166,00:42:40.000,This is the major production you wanted.
00:42:40.083,00:42:43.291,"Yeah, but do I want it this way?"
00:42:47.250,00:42:55.291,"You know, the whole us against the world thing was cute in high school, but I like opportunity, and eating out, and silken robes."
00:42:56.666,00:42:59.333,"Just know, to stay an underdog, you have to lose shit."
00:42:59.875,00:43:01.750,"Archie, we can find another producer."
00:43:01.833,00:43:03.000,I'm talking about me.
00:43:04.375,00:43:05.333,What?
00:43:09.625,00:43:13.916,I've known you since I was skinny and you pretended to like girls.
00:43:14.708,00:43:17.833,"Look, I'm doing this show on Thursday."
00:43:17.916,00:43:19.500,Show? With who?
00:43:20.041,00:43:21.458,D from Brownsville.
00:43:21.541,00:43:26.375,He's doing this artist showcase and he invited RadhaMUSprime to perform.
00:43:26.458,00:43:27.291,Who-da-mus?
00:43:28.958,00:43:30.916,"Seriously, it would mean a lot if you came."
00:43:34.375,00:43:35.208,Archie.
00:43:39.583,00:43:46.750,"Her desperation is making me nauseous, although technically, you gotta eat something to throw up, know what I mean?"
00:43:48.458,00:43:51.166,Whitman had some notes. Will you look them over?
00:43:52.041,00:43:53.875,I will seriously consider it.
00:43:56.458,00:43:59.458,"-See you on Thursday? -Whatever, bitch. Look at the notes."
00:43:59.541,00:44:00.708,You 40 yet?
00:44:02.083,00:44:03.791,Still trying that rapping shit?
00:44:03.875,00:44:05.333,"Yes, I am, ma'am."
00:44:05.416,00:44:10.875,"You know, you're not going to be satisfied until you sleeping in a box like that fool over there."
00:44:14.791,00:44:16.583,I'll beat some homeless ass.
00:44:26.000,00:44:27.500,Why are you guys still here?
00:44:30.458,00:44:31.333,Hello?
00:44:31.916,00:44:35.791,My ex-girl's older half cousin says you rhyming in a show.
00:44:36.708,00:44:37.750,"It's true, Miss B?"
00:44:40.500,00:44:41.958,Don't you guys have someplace to be?
00:44:42.041,00:44:44.625,"-Damn, it's like that? -For real?"
00:44:44.708,00:44:53.083,"You just gonna shut the youth out of a moment that could potentially change how we dream, how we look at the cold world out there, how we confront-- Yes, damn it. Okay."
00:44:56.333,00:44:59.500,"-Yo, we can come through, right? -Mm. I don't know, guys."
00:44:59.583,00:45:01.208,"Come on, Miss B."
00:45:02.000,00:45:04.000,You know we live for this kind of shit.
00:45:04.083,00:45:07.125,And you not just talking about shit. You making shit. Shit!
00:45:10.250,00:45:11.541,"Okay, but just you two."
00:45:14.708,00:45:15.708,Bet!
00:45:15.791,00:45:19.041,We got you Miss B. Mum's the fucking word.
00:45:21.875,00:45:24.208,"Ain't no minors here. We're majors, son."
00:45:24.291,00:45:27.541,"-Why you trying to play us? -What you want, some money, some weed?"
00:45:27.625,00:45:29.916,"Shut up, stupid and stupider."
00:45:30.458,00:45:31.375,I got this.
00:45:34.000,00:45:37.083,"Now, you know the charge for looking at a minor's titties?"
00:45:38.750,00:45:39.583,Yeah.
00:45:39.666,00:45:42.166,You know the charge. That's what I'm talking about.
00:45:42.250,00:45:43.333,This is my friend.
00:45:48.666,00:45:50.166,-Yeah. -She coming?
00:45:51.750,00:45:53.666,"In spirit, I guess."
00:45:57.333,00:45:58.458,"Oh, shit."
00:45:59.333,00:46:00.833,"Yo, why you ain't say nothing?"
00:46:02.750,00:46:06.291,Don't you get tired of adding people to the dead-mom club in your head?
00:46:17.208,00:46:21.666,"That's what we doing now, says the person with the metabolism of a baby goat."
00:46:22.500,00:46:23.666,You'll see.
00:46:23.750,00:46:26.458,It gets much harder to lose weight when you get older.
00:46:28.666,00:46:30.750,"Well, there ain't nothing wrong with you."
00:46:31.291,00:46:33.166,"Mm. No, just my nerves."
00:46:34.166,00:46:35.750,"Yo, it is one song."
00:46:35.833,00:46:39.833,"I know, but I just-- -Now, come on. Let's go. -What?"
00:46:39.916,00:46:40.833,Where we going?
00:46:41.833,00:46:42.958,Where we going?
00:46:47.833,00:46:50.625,Come on. It's gonna chill you out.
00:46:50.708,00:46:51.541,Trust me.
00:46:55.250,00:47:20.333,"If you have ears, come give Mick a lobe Ambidextrous, tag team drawn Both hands on the bars Like a trapeze artist I feel like Forrest Gump When he lost polio That was too straightforward Let me space out I'm glad that I had the gumption To break out If y'all ain't catch that bars Time to OD Brace yourself Gumption is what broke free Okay."
00:47:23.375,00:48:03.416,"I was there in body and spirit Jesus, what are these lyrics?

00:48:03.500,00:48:05.291,"Crazy, bro. Crazy."
00:48:12.583,00:48:41.083,"Down in all these groceries Niggas act like they don't notice me But they ashen, get some lotion, B At the top of the totem tree While these niggas hang low Like them scrotums be You're not pee So you're just loaders, free You're both crooked and straight bogus, B Your own momma is toasting me She second that emotion, B Yo, get some power and stop ghosting me Shiny bevels, swarmy levels Where your devotion be?"

00:48:58.208,00:49:00.958,"Yo, look. It's a packed show up there."
00:49:01.041,00:49:02.000,"I'mma see y'all, aight?"

00:49:23.250,00:49:26.416,"Thanks so much for coming out to support our little showcase, man."
00:49:26.500,00:49:29.125,"Yo, D worked so hard on all the beats you're hearing tonight."
00:49:31.708,00:49:34.041,Give me some of that Big D energy.
00:49:41.250,00:49:43.291,"Oh, no. I'm good. Thank you."
00:49:44.375,00:49:46.208,"You said you want to keep flowing, right?"
00:49:50.833,00:49:51.666,Yeah.
00:49:55.916,00:49:56.750,Mmm!
00:50:02.750,00:50:04.291,Yeah. Flowing.
00:50:05.333,00:50:06.291,Mm.
00:50:07.750,00:50:09.166,Is that Colorado? That's...
00:50:10.041,00:50:12.875,I can't take any credit for this next act.
00:50:12.958,00:50:15.541,"No, this is all D's discovery, yo."
00:50:15.625,00:50:20.666,"Give it up for a much older female MC, RadhaMUSprime!"
00:50:30.541,00:50:32.791,"Hey, guys. Thanks for coming out."
00:50:32.875,00:50:34.875,"Friends, students."
00:50:36.625,00:50:40.916,"Kick that beat, DJ. D... J."
00:50:45.166,00:50:46.625,Yo. Uh!
00:50:47.375,00:50:48.375,Yeah.
00:50:48.458,00:50:51.583,It's RadhaMUSprime. 40-year-old version.
00:50:52.083,00:50:53.333,"Go, Radha!"
00:51:01.916,00:51:04.291,Yo. Archie?
00:51:05.666,00:51:06.958,"Oh, my God, Archie?"
00:51:07.041,00:51:09.166,"DJ, DJ, cut the music off."
00:51:09.250,00:51:10.291,Cut the music off.
00:51:11.458,00:51:13.625,"Oh, my God, Archie. You came to my show."
00:51:13.708,00:51:15.166,"You never let me down, do you?"
00:51:15.750,00:51:19.041,"Guys, give it up for Archie. This is my best friend since..."
00:51:21.041,00:51:25.666,"You can't tell right now, but he used to have a beard in high school."
00:51:29.875,00:51:31.958,Oh my God! That was funny.
00:51:32.041,00:51:39.625,"Before I go on, let's give it up for D, who awesomely crafted all the beats that you're hearing here tonight..."
00:51:41.333,00:51:45.333,"...making Brooklyn and his dead mother so proud, you know."
00:51:46.041,00:51:51.458,"See, not all Black men are in jail knocking up babies that they can't take care of."
00:51:53.458,00:51:54.416,Woke.
00:51:56.916,00:51:58.791,Bring that beat back. How about that?
00:52:00.583,00:52:01.583,Yeah.
00:52:02.500,00:52:03.583,"Come on, y'all."
00:52:32.000,00:52:33.000,Yo?
00:52:34.583,00:52:37.500,"Archie, what's wrong with me?"
00:52:43.291,00:52:45.000,I'm a playwright.
00:52:46.708,00:52:50.625,"Oh, God. Give me a chance to make this right."
00:52:50.708,00:52:52.041,"Oh! Oh, God."
00:52:52.666,00:52:59.583,"I'm-- I'm still rhyming, and I didn't mean to rhyme, not that time."
00:52:59.666,00:53:01.708,"Oh, God, I'm still doing it."
00:53:03.125,00:53:05.166,"Damn. Damn, damn."
00:53:07.541,00:53:10.083,"Oh, my poor ebony flower."
00:53:10.625,00:53:16.125,"I'm not going to use my lips to tell you I told you so, but..."
00:53:24.333,00:53:28.250,We gots to give some kind of contribution.
00:53:30.250,00:53:31.125,You know?
00:54:25.541,00:54:27.458,Why? They're yours.
00:54:28.250,00:54:29.166,You paid for them.
00:54:30.666,00:54:33.416,You were one of her few actual patrons.
00:54:37.416,00:54:41.625,"You know, they say that after your mother dies you see her in a dream, but..."
00:54:42.666,00:54:44.416,a whole year passes and nothing.
00:54:46.250,00:54:49.875,"Oh, shit, even my dreams need rewrites."
00:54:54.166,00:54:55.666,How's your brother holding up?
00:54:56.208,00:54:58.791,I don't know. We keep missing each other.
00:55:02.833,00:55:03.916,Wait a minute.
00:55:04.833,00:55:05.916,Where's Antonio?
00:55:09.041,00:55:11.541,What?
00:55:12.333,00:55:14.583,-Jack Llenna's premiere got moved. -Mm-hmm.
00:55:14.666,00:55:16.958,He's my top-grossing client. I couldn't miss it.
00:55:17.916,00:55:20.083,"So, I had to postpone Greece."
00:55:20.791,00:55:23.000,No thongs. Shit.
00:55:24.250,00:55:28.750,Antonio lost it. Said I care more about my clients than I do him.
00:55:28.833,00:55:30.250,-Hmm. -Lies.
00:55:38.166,00:55:39.750,Maybe now you can date Korean.
00:55:39.833,00:55:41.291,You sound like my mother.
00:55:43.666,00:55:45.625,Why you not bring Korean baby?
00:55:45.708,00:55:47.291,"-Um, no. -What?"
00:55:47.958,00:55:50.708,"What? Oh, I can't do that because I'm Black?"
00:55:50.791,00:55:52.291,"Uh, who's racist now?"
00:55:52.375,00:55:55.541,And scene. That's a wrap on Shut the Fuck Up.
00:56:05.375,00:56:06.208,I'll do it.
00:56:06.875,00:56:07.791,Shut the Fuck Up?
00:56:09.041,00:56:10.041,"No, Whitman."
00:56:11.666,00:56:16.583,I'll do the play if you think that he would still-- Of course. I had him in the palm...
00:56:17.875,00:56:18.875,He'll do it.
00:56:20.958,00:56:22.041,Are you sure?
00:56:23.458,00:56:24.291,Yeah.
00:56:28.666,00:56:30.666,Come. Drink of mommy milk.
00:56:34.625,00:56:39.458,"Look, I ain't say that you couldn't, but you shouldn't."
00:56:43.750,00:56:44.875,Hell no!
00:56:46.041,00:56:48.416,We gots to be sensible.
00:56:54.666,00:57:03.500,"Now, since retiring, I took it upon myself to impart my own ministry of truth around Harlem."
00:57:07.125,00:57:13.916,"You might not want to hear the truth, but like these mosquitoes..."
00:57:16.375,00:57:18.166,...I'm biting that ass.
00:57:30.458,00:57:33.333,-I love the new characters. -You do?
00:57:33.416,00:57:37.250,Yes. The sassy old Black woman doling out unwanted advice.
00:57:37.333,00:57:38.708,Love her.
00:57:38.791,00:57:43.208,The teens are fine. You just need to spice them up with a little rap number.
00:57:45.833,00:57:49.083,We're going to organize a workshop and you'll be able to see all the changes.
00:57:49.708,00:57:51.250,Great. Um...
00:57:52.166,00:57:58.583,"Before I forget, I just wanted to say to you that I-- It's okay. I spoke to Archie."
00:57:59.208,00:58:03.625,And I know about your dead mom and how sorry you are for choking me.
00:58:03.708,00:58:05.583,"-Mm. -Look, no more apologies."
00:58:05.666,00:58:07.750,-I'm over it and we can move on. -Okay.
00:58:08.416,00:58:12.625,"Plus, we've got a little buzz, and buzz means butts in seats."
00:58:15.250,00:58:18.833,I also wanted to talk to you about...
00:58:19.666,00:58:22.375,having a Black director is really important to me.
00:58:22.458,00:58:25.375,"Of course, we want that for you too. We'll make that happen."
00:58:25.458,00:58:26.875,-Okay? All right. -Yeah.
00:58:27.625,00:58:29.458,"-Oh, one more note... -Mm-hmm?"
00:58:29.541,00:58:31.541,-Gentrification. -Hmm.
00:58:31.625,00:58:34.916,It shouldn't just be this thing that's happening out there.
00:58:35.000,00:58:38.375,"We need to personify it in the play, you know?"
00:58:41.708,00:58:49.041,"If we have a Black couple facing gentrification in Harlem, we need to know just who's gentrifying."
00:58:51.958,00:58:58.708,"Mm, I don't know. See, my play is about-- I know what your play's about, and I also know we need to grab the core audience."
00:59:00.291,00:59:03.333,"And to do that, you have to write them in the play."
00:59:06.833,00:59:07.666,Good.
00:59:12.291,00:59:15.625,I wish I could have been there. Oh my God!
00:59:15.708,00:59:18.041,"She was like, Yo, yo, yo!"
00:59:18.125,00:59:21.541,"Okay, fine. So we have this spermazoid."
00:59:22.125,00:59:24.375,"Ah, but what is his motivation?"
00:59:24.458,00:59:26.375,-What is he after? You know? -Hey.
00:59:33.041,00:59:34.833,RadhaMUS? More like NotiMUS.
00:59:37.458,00:59:38.916,I'll bust her ass if you want.
00:59:39.000,00:59:41.208,"Man, fuck her, Miss B."
00:59:41.916,00:59:44.541,Aight? We just glad to have you back. We missed you.
00:59:45.291,00:59:47.583,"Word, yo. What happened up there?"
00:59:48.166,00:59:50.416,Sound like you was having a stroke or something.
00:59:50.500,00:59:53.583,No pendejo. Clearly she had a nervous breakdown.
00:59:54.958,00:59:58.416,"They was calling you frozen yo-gurt, Miss B."
01:00:02.166,01:00:03.250,You want to talk about it?
01:00:28.666,01:00:32.708,"Well, no, it's not the director that I wanted, you know?"
01:00:32.791,01:00:35.708,Her all-male version of Steel Magnolias was amazing.
01:00:35.791,01:00:37.125,There go my fears.
01:00:37.625,01:00:39.458,"It's just a workshop, right?"
01:00:39.541,01:00:43.583,"No, you're right. It's just a workshop. I'm going to power through it."
01:00:44.416,01:00:45.416,That's my girl.
01:00:47.416,01:00:50.416,"-Look, Archie, I'm gonna call you later. -Okay, bye."
01:00:50.500,01:00:51.541,Thanks.
01:00:52.416,01:00:54.583,"-Hey, girl! -Hey!"
01:00:56.500,01:00:58.916,You recovered from the other night?
01:00:59.000,01:01:01.375,"Who, me? Oh, yeah. No, I'm good."
01:01:01.458,01:01:07.458,"Yeah, that was like a live... performance experimental thing that I was going for."
01:01:07.541,01:01:08.625,But I'm glad you're here.
01:01:08.708,01:01:10.708,"-Girl, you know I love this play. -Cool."
01:01:10.791,01:01:14.291,"I mean, it's a bit different than I remember."
01:01:14.375,01:01:16.833,"Yeah, my producer gave me some notes."
01:01:17.416,01:01:20.166,"Um, turns out I don't need 15 characters."
01:01:21.333,01:01:23.750,"And he's writing the check, so you know how that goes."
01:01:23.833,01:01:26.875,-Yeah. -So you fine with all the changes?
01:01:27.750,01:01:29.083,"Uh, yeah."
01:01:29.166,01:01:38.750,"Yeah. I mean, you know, Stacey, writing is rewriting, and I just decided with this draft, to hone in on a more, uh, universal tone, you know?"
01:01:39.625,01:01:40.458,Harlem.
01:01:41.208,01:01:47.166,"For all its color and splendor and beauty, still has a way to go, you know?"
01:01:47.958,01:01:51.916,"Like, what's a girl gotta do to get some soy milk around here?"
01:01:57.875,01:02:06.291,"Baby, I hear you. I'm not suggesting we change our whole flow, just that we incorporate some of the things these new Harlemites want."
01:02:06.375,01:02:08.041,New Harlemites?
01:02:08.125,01:02:09.833,Does that even sound right?
01:02:09.916,01:02:12.125,"Baby, we can't be changing for them."
01:02:12.208,01:02:20.500,"We gots to-- We gots to-- Um, Radha?"
01:02:22.125,01:02:23.208,Yeah.
01:02:23.291,01:02:24.625,"Look, I don't mean to..."
01:02:24.708,01:02:26.875,No. Go ahead. This is exactly why we're here.
01:02:26.958,01:02:28.875,This is the work. We are working it.
01:02:28.958,01:02:32.000,Okay. Why is she talking like this?
01:02:37.500,01:02:41.666,"The wife, she is trying to persuade her husband."
01:02:42.291,01:02:48.166,"He wants to stock the shelves with soy milk, and she's concerned about the gentrification."
01:02:48.250,01:02:51.583,"No, no, I know what her concerns are."
01:02:51.666,01:02:53.875,I'm wondering about the language.
01:02:54.458,01:02:57.708,"Ah! The vernacular, the verbiage."
01:02:57.791,01:03:00.958,"Um, well, um, why don't we ask our playwright?"
01:03:03.375,01:03:09.166,"Okay. Uh, well, the wife, um... she's from the old school."
01:03:09.250,01:03:10.791,She's 35.
01:03:10.875,01:03:12.875,I know. I know that.
01:03:13.666,01:03:14.708,I know that.
01:03:15.375,01:03:24.208,"Um, I guess what I mean is that she is rooted in, like, a deep... Southern mystical charm."
01:03:24.291,01:03:26.500,-You know? -Not quite.
01:03:27.041,01:03:28.000,I get it.
01:03:28.833,01:03:33.750,I'm wondering why she's the only character talking like that.
01:03:33.833,01:03:38.041,Jamie doesn't talk like that. Marcus doesn't talk like that.
01:03:38.125,01:03:45.083,"Okay, the fact that the wife speaks one way and Jamie speaks another is because, um..."
01:03:45.166,01:03:48.416,"-I'm white. -No, no, no! No!"
01:03:48.500,01:03:49.458,"No, no, no."
01:03:49.541,01:03:53.375,Race in this moment is completely irrelevant.
01:03:53.458,01:03:57.125,"Okay, look, I know why the wife speaks this way."
01:03:57.208,01:04:09.166,"I just, uh, can't quite articulate that, but I need for you to keep talking that way so I can learn what it is and then give that to you so that you can then give that to us."
01:04:09.250,01:04:10.083,Okay?
01:04:12.208,01:04:14.000,"Back to it, baby."
01:04:19.041,01:04:21.791,I... wow. I am so sorry.
01:04:21.875,01:04:24.666,I'm just gonna take this really quickly.
01:04:45.500,01:04:47.500,"And, uh, who the fuck is that?"
01:04:47.583,01:04:49.333,RosettaMUSprime.
01:04:50.291,01:04:51.375,Funny.
01:04:53.916,01:04:55.333,I never said that.
01:04:56.041,01:05:00.875,"Look, I sent you, like, 300 texts, my nigga, and I don't text."
01:05:00.958,01:05:04.375,"Yeah, uh, I've just been busy with rehearsals of my play."
01:05:09.875,01:05:12.125,"No, I had a lapse in judgment."
01:05:14.416,01:05:18.750,"Oh, a lapse in judgment is when someone is, you know-- No, I know."
01:05:18.833,01:05:21.583,"So, what? You don't want to fuck with this music shit no more?"
01:05:23.333,01:05:24.166,Hello?
01:05:24.666,01:05:26.083,-D... -What?
01:05:27.166,01:05:28.541,"Don't be that way, okay?"
01:05:28.625,01:05:30.166,"Look, it's not a total loss."
01:05:30.666,01:05:34.583,I'm actually thinking of incorporating some of the rhymes into my play.
01:05:34.666,01:05:35.583,What?
01:05:39.458,01:05:42.041,"I'm three months shy of 40, okay?"
01:05:43.375,01:05:45.708,So I need to stay in my lane.
01:05:46.333,01:05:47.375,You know?
01:05:49.083,01:05:50.250,Hello?
01:05:50.333,01:05:51.166,I heard you.
01:05:54.666,01:05:55.583,Hello?
01:05:56.833,01:05:57.708,Really?
01:05:59.541,01:06:02.000,"Hey, are we going to spit this fire or what?"
01:06:02.708,01:06:09.541,"This... is not... soy milk, people."
01:06:11.000,01:06:17.291,"No, what's in this carton is what each of the characters need from each other."
01:06:18.041,01:06:19.916,It's... it's love.
01:06:21.083,01:06:22.250,It's fresh air.
01:06:23.333,01:06:25.750,It's fresh produce. It's...
01:06:26.500,01:06:29.791,rent-controlled apartments. It's block parties.
01:06:29.875,01:06:30.708,It's...
01:06:31.833,01:06:33.250,it's old Black women...
01:06:34.416,01:06:38.166,"sitting on a stoop, humming..."
01:06:39.666,01:06:40.958,as they open...

01:07:16.958,01:07:18.208,"That's fucked up, yo."
01:07:19.208,01:07:23.000,"Got these good oils, people. These good oils, you wanna get in on this."

01:07:29.458,01:07:30.458,You should buy them.
01:07:31.291,01:07:33.291,It only costs a dollar. You should try it.
01:07:33.875,01:07:36.375,-I'm okay. -I'm your local Muslim from the hood.
01:07:37.000,01:07:39.375,"Sister, let me make you smell good."
01:07:40.458,01:07:42.083,You look like you stressed...

01:07:46.416,01:07:48.916,"Right here, from your Muslim man right here."
01:08:08.000,01:08:09.291,It's not that simple.
01:08:09.833,01:08:13.583,It is. You just have to change your perspective.
01:08:13.666,01:08:16.416,T'aint nothing wrong with my damn perspective.
01:08:16.500,01:08:19.416,Excuse me? Don't take that tone with me.
01:08:19.500,01:08:22.375,"Ladies, ladies, stop."
01:08:23.208,01:08:25.083,Just... stop.

01:09:25.083,01:09:26.500,Preposterous!
01:09:26.583,01:09:33.500,"You killed all my guards, destroyed my spermicide castle, and now you expect me to let you in?"
01:09:33.583,01:09:36.666,Have I not proven that I'd do anything to get to you?
01:09:37.125,01:09:40.083,"What I look like, some stupid ho that I go for dumb shit like that?"
01:09:40.166,01:09:42.333,"That's not even the line, Rosa!"
01:09:43.500,01:09:46.416,"So, you just can't be changing shit up like that."
01:09:46.500,01:09:49.208,"Aight, first of all, she got to be more feminist, yo."
01:09:49.291,01:09:50.791,She can't just be letting some dude...
01:09:53.916,01:09:55.875,"-You coming in? -Nah, I'm good."
01:09:57.625,01:10:00.208,"-You sure? You can, you know. -I'm good."
01:10:04.625,01:10:06.833,"You're not good, you're bad as hell is what you are."
01:10:21.833,01:10:24.416,"Yo, nigga, what the fuck, man? Hello?"
01:10:24.500,01:10:26.291,"Yo, my fault, son. You wanna run that back?"
01:10:28.208,01:10:29.791,You still tripping over that old broad?
01:10:29.875,01:10:31.541,"Nigga, fuck you. She's not old."
01:10:31.625,01:10:33.250,"Shit, nigga, she ain't young."
01:10:36.083,01:10:38.541,"You know, at least she gave me some storytelling."
01:10:39.458,01:10:41.625,"Like, what the fuck are you even saying in there?"
01:10:42.166,01:10:43.041,You even know?
01:10:44.208,01:10:48.708,"Yo, half of y'all niggas, y'all just be coming in here stringing words together like you doing something."
01:10:49.291,01:10:52.083,"Nigga, I make the beats, but God damn, son!"
01:10:52.166,01:10:54.250,Sometimes you need some storytelling.
01:10:54.333,01:10:56.083,"Like, what are you even talkin' about?"
01:11:00.541,01:11:02.416,"I'm ready, fuck it. Play the beat."
01:11:03.875,01:11:04.708,Harlem...
01:11:05.458,01:11:08.041,the place I've called home my whole life.
01:11:09.958,01:11:10.833,Harlem...
01:11:11.416,01:11:15.875,she wrapped me in her arms and mothered me when my own mother passed on.
01:11:17.500,01:11:18.333,Harlem...
01:11:18.791,01:11:28.375,"where I became a wife, a business owner, where I'd imagine owning my own home one day, but where a woman can't even afford the damn rent."
01:11:32.541,01:11:41.416,...preparing meals in my own kitchen and hope to hear my children call out to me-- I'm so sorry.
01:11:41.500,01:11:43.875,Let me... excuse me. Sorry.
01:11:43.958,01:11:45.750,I'll be right back. I'm so sorry.
01:11:47.125,01:11:48.875,"I will fuck you up in this hallway, you hear me?"
01:11:52.375,01:11:54.208,"Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here?"
01:11:54.291,01:11:56.125,"Radha, can you tell this bitch you know me?"
01:11:56.208,01:11:58.333,"Sir, he's with me, please."
01:12:01.458,01:12:03.666,Fucking Robopop. Shit.
01:12:04.750,01:12:05.583,Radha.
01:12:06.666,01:12:08.875,"Archie, this is D. D, this is Archie."
01:12:09.541,01:12:11.250,"Can you give us a second, please?"
01:12:12.291,01:12:13.250,Please?
01:12:19.666,01:12:20.541,Are you okay?
01:12:21.083,01:12:22.958,"Yeah, when we finishing these tracks?"
01:12:24.041,01:12:27.333,You can't be serious. I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.
01:12:32.833,01:12:33.666,Okay.
01:12:40.041,01:12:43.541,I don't understand. I gave you guys a list of names.
01:12:43.625,01:12:47.625,"We tried, but all the working Black directors are working."
01:12:48.416,01:12:50.708,-This fucking sucks. -It's gonna be fine.
01:12:50.791,01:12:54.583,"Julie will give you what you need. She directed Raisin in the Sun, you know."
01:12:54.666,01:12:58.583,"Radha, we need to move forward, okay? Good night."
01:13:00.375,01:13:05.458,"Look, I know it's not ideal, but in three months when you're on Broadway, you won't even remember this shit."
01:13:08.833,01:13:10.833,"Oh, hello."
01:13:11.541,01:13:17.916,"All right, listen. You just work on those rewrites that we talked about, and then I'll talk to Whitman, and we'll smooth it-- Radha?"
01:13:18.541,01:13:19.541,Radha!
01:13:42.333,01:13:44.375,Julie will give you what you need.
01:13:45.166,01:13:47.000,Julie will give you what you need.
01:13:47.083,01:13:49.916,"Don't worry, Radha. Julie will give you what you need."
01:13:51.166,01:13:53.833,What the fuck does Julie know about living in Harlem?
01:13:57.125,01:14:00.166,"Wait, where are we even going?"
01:14:05.250,01:14:06.875,Guess I'm being kidnapped.
01:14:09.875,01:14:11.000,Is that you?
01:14:50.416,01:14:51.583,We're in the Bronx.
01:14:52.375,01:14:56.250,Exactly where I thought I'd end my night and my life.
01:14:57.041,01:14:59.041,Thanks. Perfect.
01:15:04.583,01:15:05.750,What is going on?
01:15:07.416,01:15:09.625,"No. No, no, no."
01:15:09.708,01:15:11.750,I'm not going to a damn party.
01:15:11.833,01:15:13.416,"Look, it's not a party."
01:15:14.041,01:15:15.041,Just come on.
01:15:15.916,01:15:17.708,"No, I have rewrites."
01:15:22.250,01:15:23.375,Fuck you.
01:15:23.458,01:15:24.750,"Aight, look."
01:15:25.250,01:15:27.708,"Before, I overheard it from the hallway..."
01:15:27.791,01:15:29.125,and the shit is corny.
01:15:31.000,01:15:32.916,Like you know anything about theater.
01:15:34.416,01:15:37.625,"making your fucked up assumptions. Like, who ain't seen Hamilton?"
01:15:39.458,01:15:41.625,"-No, I'm not going to-- -Yo."
01:15:41.708,01:15:45.791,"-Come on. Come on. -Great. Well, welcome to the Bronx."

01:22:49.166,01:22:50.291,My mother drew that.
01:22:51.750,01:22:57.083,"It's part of a series of greeting cards she did in the '70s that never quite took off, but, yeah."
01:22:57.708,01:22:59.750,"That must have been dope, though."
01:22:59.833,01:23:00.833,What?
01:23:00.916,01:23:02.791,Having an artist for your moms.
01:23:03.291,01:23:04.291,That's crazy.
01:23:05.708,01:23:07.708,"She was great, but..."
01:23:09.208,01:23:11.375,"there were other parts, you know."
01:23:11.458,01:23:16.125,"Government cheese, and, uh... squatting."
01:23:17.083,01:23:19.500,"-Artist life. -Nah, word?"
01:23:19.583,01:23:23.541,"Yeah, God, my mother struggled. My dad did too. Both of them."
01:23:23.625,01:23:25.541,"As artists, you know?"
01:23:26.125,01:23:27.916,My father was a jazz drummer.
01:23:28.708,01:23:31.875,"But to support the family, he would do plumbing work."
01:23:32.666,01:23:37.750,And he did it so much that it would leave like permanent oil stains on his hand.
01:23:38.583,01:23:39.750,-That's crazy. -Yeah.
01:23:39.833,01:23:41.125,And my mother...
01:23:41.958,01:23:44.000,"when she wasn't painting, she was teaching."

01:23:53.791,01:23:54.833,Struggle.
01:23:56.250,01:23:57.541,But here I am.
01:24:00.458,01:24:04.250,"Yeah, my mom didn't think me making music made sense, either."
01:24:04.333,01:24:05.375,No?
01:24:05.458,01:24:07.916,"Nah, but I'm like..."
01:24:08.708,01:24:11.500,"You're the one that put Coltrane and Quincy, like, in me."

01:24:24.458,01:24:25.416,"Yours too, though."
01:24:28.666,01:24:30.541,"Nah, your moms."
01:24:31.583,01:24:32.708,She proud of you.
01:24:35.791,01:24:38.791,You ain't never try to... talk to her?
01:24:40.958,01:24:41.791,No.
01:24:43.458,01:24:44.541,Why not? Like...
01:24:46.625,01:24:48.583,I don't know. I don't know what I would say.
01:25:00.208,01:25:01.083,What?

01:27:23.250,01:27:24.583,Let me ask you a question.
01:27:25.208,01:27:26.833,"You were just talking shit before, right?"
01:27:27.458,01:27:28.291,I'm sorry?
01:27:28.791,01:27:30.458,"Nah, like, for the mixtape."
01:27:30.541,01:27:32.375,You never wanted to do this shit.
01:27:33.000,01:27:35.708,"Nah, it's just another trip to the Black terrain for you."
01:27:35.791,01:27:37.708,I don't know what you're talking about.
01:27:38.416,01:27:40.416,That's crazy. I came to Harlem for this shit?
01:27:42.250,01:27:44.625,"D! D, wait!"
01:27:47.750,01:27:50.750,My baby's finally got her back blown out.
01:27:52.291,01:27:54.833,Come here. Come here. Let me talk to you.
01:28:02.000,01:28:03.166,I am she.
01:28:03.583,01:28:05.500,I am Black divorcee.
01:28:05.583,01:28:07.125,Cut. I don't believe you.
01:28:08.416,01:28:10.791,Where's the rotting carcass of your broken heart?
01:28:10.875,01:28:12.208,I need to smell it.
01:28:13.250,01:28:14.250,I need to smell it.
01:28:15.000,01:28:15.833,Yeah.
01:28:27.041,01:28:29.833,There should be a fire in the crack of your ass.
01:28:29.916,01:28:31.291,Be the phoenix.
01:28:32.708,01:28:36.250,I am bursting out from behind the head!
01:28:36.333,01:28:38.208,"Yes, damn it! Yes, damn it!"
01:28:38.291,01:28:40.583,"-You had your chance, Darlene! -Yeah, you had it!"
01:28:40.666,01:28:43.750,"-You had it, Darlene. Yes! -Now stay the fuck away!"
01:28:43.833,01:28:45.750,Give it to me. Give it to me.
01:28:45.833,01:28:48.708,-Just let me say what I got to say. -Yes.
01:28:48.791,01:28:49.791,-Okay? -Uh-huh!
01:28:50.500,01:28:51.833,-I am me. -Me.
01:28:52.541,01:28:53.916,-I am free. -Free.
01:28:58.166,01:29:00.041,Yes! Yes!
01:29:08.166,01:29:11.000,I'm Frank DiLella. Remember this face?
01:29:11.083,01:29:15.125,She was one of Spotlight Magazine's 30 Under 30 playwrights to watch.
01:29:15.833,01:29:17.500,"We watched, but where'd she go?"
01:29:18.208,01:29:26.166,"Well, after years of obscurity, she's returned to the theater in J. Whitman's searing new production of Harlem Avenue, directed by Julie Lipshitz."
01:29:26.250,01:29:29.208,"It's Harlem Ave, but okay."
01:29:29.291,01:29:31.916,Harlem Ave premieres in just a couple days.
01:29:32.000,01:29:34.291,"Welcome, New York playwright, Radha Blank."
01:29:34.375,01:29:37.083,"Frank, it's so awesome to be sitting with you. Thanks for having me."
01:29:37.833,01:29:38.875,"Radha, where have you been?"
01:29:39.583,01:29:45.083,"I've been, uh, writing plays and teaching theater to teens in Harlem."
01:29:45.166,01:29:46.000,"Hey, guys."
01:29:48.208,01:29:49.833,"Mm, my boo looks nice."
01:29:49.916,01:29:51.458,"Yo, she's official, son."
01:29:51.541,01:29:53.208,"That's my teacher, yo."
01:29:53.291,01:29:55.875,"Speaking of Harlem, what is Harlem Ave about?"
01:29:56.875,01:29:58.416,Harlem Ave is about...
01:30:01.041,01:30:07.416,"a young Black couple, and their young white neighbor, and how the three of them see gentrification from different angles."
01:30:07.500,01:30:09.333,What inspired you to write this?
01:30:10.041,01:30:12.875,I just wanted to talk about what's going on in Harlem.
01:30:13.416,01:30:18.500,Is it true you and J. Whitman are collaborating on his new Ida B. Wells musical?
01:30:21.833,01:30:26.208,"With opening night just days away, and a return to the theater in almost a decade..."
01:30:26.291,01:30:27.125,Yes.
01:30:27.208,01:30:29.708,...what scares you the most about this moment?
01:30:39.833,01:30:42.416,You are giving me Miss Sofia in the motherland realness.
01:30:42.500,01:30:44.791,"No, I look like an angry mushroom."
01:30:45.291,01:30:46.625,No. No.
01:30:46.708,01:30:48.875,"Look, don't worry about it. We'll find something."
01:30:51.166,01:30:56.625,"Opening night is like, a few nights away, and I... I feel like shit, Archie."
01:30:56.708,01:30:59.166,It's nerves. I've seen it a million times.
01:30:59.750,01:31:01.333,"No, it's not nerves."
01:31:01.875,01:31:03.625,You still drinking that diet drink?
01:31:05.250,01:31:06.291,It's the play.
01:31:08.000,01:31:09.375,It's not mine anymore.
01:31:11.416,01:31:12.625,The next one will be.
01:31:15.375,01:31:17.375,What kind of fucking response is that?
01:31:19.666,01:31:22.750,"Oh, no, hon. Do not come for me."
01:31:24.083,01:31:25.166,Why not?
01:31:26.041,01:31:28.125,"Why not, Archie? You played your part."
01:31:28.208,01:31:29.625,-What? -Yeah.
01:31:29.708,01:31:33.166,"Look, you got yourself here, okay? No one forced you to do anything."
01:31:33.250,01:31:35.500,You always do what you want. You fucked that 25-year-old.
01:31:35.583,01:31:38.000,"-26! -Yeah, you did that rapping shit."
01:31:38.083,01:31:40.333,That rapping shit made me feel good about myself.
01:31:42.333,01:31:44.333,You acted like Whitman was our only shot.
01:31:44.416,01:31:46.083,Like I wasn't going to have another chance.
01:31:46.166,01:31:49.083,"Don't you dare accuse me of not believing in you, okay?"
01:31:49.166,01:31:50.708,Do you have any idea what I...
01:31:53.750,01:31:54.666,What?
01:31:55.625,01:31:57.791,"Jiggled his balls a little, yes."
01:31:58.416,01:31:59.791,Anything for a friend.
01:32:02.041,01:32:05.375,"Well, let's give it up for patron saint Archie."
01:32:05.458,01:32:09.166,Jiggling old wrinkly balls on behalf of the poor.
01:32:09.250,01:32:11.541,"Please, Archie, you ain't do that shit for me."
01:32:11.625,01:32:13.375,-What? -You did it for yourself.
01:32:13.458,01:32:16.916,"Now, tell me why the fuck am I still your client?"
01:32:17.000,01:32:18.166,"Oh, you want to go there."
01:32:18.250,01:32:19.541,We don't have to.
01:32:19.625,01:32:22.916,We all know you keep me around because it makes you feel better.
01:32:23.000,01:32:23.875,About?
01:32:24.458,01:32:26.750,"About paying $5,000 a month for rent."
01:32:27.333,01:32:31.583,About taking vacations to Greece in your thongs and shit.
01:32:31.666,01:32:33.958,-Acting like you're not really even-- -What?
01:32:36.208,01:32:37.083,Korean?
01:32:37.791,01:32:38.750,I didn't say that.
01:32:41.208,01:32:44.000,Was my dad thrilled that my prom date was Black?
01:32:44.083,01:32:46.583,"No, but thank God you were a girl."
01:32:47.375,01:32:59.750,"You played along and saved my sissy ass from getting beat, and I will always love you for that, but we are grown, and I am out and proud, and very Korean."
01:33:00.375,01:33:03.333,And I don't owe you anything except friendship and honesty.
01:33:03.416,01:33:05.625,"Yes, you are fucking talented."
01:33:05.708,01:33:10.166,"Yes, your mom is dead, but you are not above being a sellout."
01:33:16.125,01:33:17.583,"I'm not a sellout, Archie."
01:33:18.166,01:33:19.208,Take it back.
01:33:21.500,01:33:23.333,I said take it back.
01:33:28.541,01:33:29.416,You know what?
01:33:30.916,01:33:31.750,Fuck you.
01:33:34.333,01:33:37.166,Fuck these ugly-ass dresses.
01:33:37.875,01:33:40.250,And fuck opening night. I'm not even going.
01:33:47.000,01:33:49.083,Fuck! Fuck!
01:36:43.416,01:36:54.375,"Looking at your face I just spoiled my lunch You can't mess me or even test me Mm, not quite."
01:36:56.416,01:36:57.750,About fucking time.
01:36:58.458,01:36:59.333,I'm here.
01:37:10.500,01:37:11.541,I don't know.
01:37:12.583,01:37:14.625,I think right after you were born.
01:37:17.458,01:37:22.208,Her Ethiopian Coptic art phase of the '70s.
01:37:25.750,01:37:27.333,"So, what do we do with it now?"
01:37:32.083,01:37:33.875,and I don't have any more room.
01:37:33.958,01:37:36.750,"Uh, neither do I. I live in a box, remember?"
01:37:38.750,01:37:39.583,Fine.
01:37:48.916,01:37:52.000,You come here with a dream and your work ends up in storage.
01:37:53.500,01:37:55.083,Is that what you think of Ma?
01:37:55.750,01:37:57.250,"No, I'm just saying."
01:37:59.250,01:38:00.958,Ma did what she wanted to.
01:38:01.041,01:38:05.083,She was a teacher. She was a curator.
01:38:05.750,01:38:08.000,She chanted. She traveled.
01:38:08.083,01:38:10.208,She did some art. She did some theater.
01:38:10.708,01:38:11.958,She lived a life.
01:38:14.458,01:38:16.708,She was a lot more than just these paintings.
01:38:17.541,01:38:20.916,"No, but she came to New York to become a famous artist."
01:38:21.666,01:38:23.791,And what does she have to even show for it?
01:38:24.458,01:38:26.583,"Us, you dummy."
01:38:27.250,01:38:29.750,She said that we were her greatest creation.
01:38:33.500,01:38:34.583,Mm.
01:38:42.750,01:38:43.791,I really miss her.
01:38:44.333,01:38:45.291,"Me too, sis."
01:39:13.375,01:39:14.291,Elaine.
01:39:19.041,01:39:20.208,You got a second?
01:39:29.500,01:39:30.500,How's it going?
01:39:35.208,01:39:37.666,I think you should come back to class.
01:39:38.333,01:39:39.208,I'm good.
01:39:40.666,01:39:41.666,I know.
01:39:41.750,01:39:44.041,That's why I think you should come back to class.
01:39:45.041,01:39:46.500,"You're a natural, Elaine."
01:39:50.250,01:39:57.958,"Look, I know we have some beef, but I am completely over it, especially since I know it had nothing to do with me."
01:39:59.375,01:40:00.291,What you mean?
01:40:01.666,01:40:10.083,I'm talking about expecting to like one kind of person and then this other kind of person comes along and...
01:40:11.125,01:40:12.208,they affect you.
01:40:14.500,01:40:15.333,Rosa.
01:40:16.125,01:40:17.083,What about her?
01:40:20.125,01:40:22.083,I think you should stay for class.
01:40:26.500,01:40:28.083,"Well, look here!"
01:40:28.166,01:40:30.625,"-Oh, boy. -Oh, shit. You back?"
01:40:36.083,01:40:42.125,"Well, I guess if the dean said you have to come back to class, you can understudy Rosa."
01:40:42.208,01:40:45.916,Wow. Black Jesus is really shining on you.
01:40:46.583,01:40:48.000,-Understudy? -Mm-hmm.
01:40:48.083,01:40:49.666,Nah. Mm-mm.
01:40:49.750,01:40:53.000,"Oh, shit. Wild Woman Fights, Part Deux."
01:40:53.083,01:40:56.583,"Look, Rosa, I don't even-- Nah, fuck that, Miss B. She ain't understudying me."
01:40:56.666,01:40:57.958,"Calm down, Rosa, okay?"
01:41:01.458,01:41:03.166,"I'm sick of playing this broad, yo!"
01:41:03.250,01:41:05.583,"I mean, no offense, but these breeding chicks?"
01:41:05.666,01:41:07.833,And then to have this Dumbo all up on me and shit?
01:41:07.916,01:41:10.458,"I mean, I got range and shit, but I ain't that good."
01:41:10.541,01:41:12.041,"Please, Elaine, take this shit."
01:41:14.250,01:41:15.166,You heard her.
01:41:16.208,01:41:20.500,"So, does that mean I can simulate running up in Elaine now?"
01:41:23.500,01:41:25.125,-Move! -Damn.
01:41:29.583,01:41:30.708,Wow.
01:41:32.416,01:41:33.541,About fucking time!
01:41:35.291,01:41:39.625,"Hail, hail our new Queen of Vaginal Eggs."
01:42:02.333,01:42:05.708,"Look, I know you wanted to skip out, but it's still your big night."
01:42:06.500,01:42:07.541,Hope to see you.
01:42:08.708,01:42:09.583,Bye.
01:42:19.708,01:42:23.916,"Hey, D, it's me, Radha."
01:42:25.625,01:42:26.666,Um...
01:42:29.291,01:42:30.416,I was just calling.
01:42:35.750,01:42:38.833,"Yeah, I don't know why I always wear this thing on my head."
01:42:40.375,01:42:44.333,Maybe for a... sense of comfort?
01:42:48.375,01:42:50.708,"Anyway, I was just calling."
01:42:52.458,01:42:53.333,Okay.
01:42:54.333,01:42:56.333,See you later... or not.
01:43:19.041,01:43:20.125,Mm!
01:43:21.750,01:43:22.583,Wait.
01:43:23.916,01:43:25.291,Why you all dressed up?
01:43:26.916,01:43:28.166,You going to a funeral?
01:43:29.958,01:43:31.250,What's up with this sandwich?
01:43:33.250,01:43:34.333,You poisoning me?
01:43:35.041,01:43:37.291,Shit! I'm dead.
01:43:38.958,01:43:40.708,"I better finish it, though, huh?"
01:43:47.125,01:43:48.416,Oswaldo Rivera.
01:43:49.125,01:43:50.791,"Sorry, you're not on the list."
01:43:50.875,01:43:52.250,"No, no, we on that list."
01:43:52.333,01:43:53.875,We know her. That's our teacher.
01:43:54.500,01:43:59.375,"You just think we came from Harlem and got all dressed up and shit just to harass your pasty white ass, that's what you saying?"
01:43:59.458,01:44:01.916,"What's the problem, lady? You need to see my tits or something?"
01:44:04.000,01:44:05.583,"It's my opening night, right?"
01:44:07.083,01:44:08.250,But Archie was right.
01:44:09.625,01:44:10.625,I sold out.
01:44:11.750,01:44:12.583,And now what?
01:44:12.666,01:44:15.291,I have to go down and sit through that shit?
01:44:20.500,01:44:25.125,"So, this is the part where I tell you I was an artist who'd fallen from grace, right?"
01:44:26.000,01:44:32.583,Then I impart some wisdom to you that changes your outlook because you gave me a fucking sandwich?
01:44:33.958,01:44:41.875,Like I'm some fucking magical Negro just sitting here with shit in my pants so I can help you make up your mind?
01:44:42.458,01:44:45.291,"Nope, I ain't that nigga."
01:44:46.250,01:44:54.083,"And maybe next time, if it don't kill you, could you put some mayonnaise on both sides of this dry-ass bread?"
01:44:55.458,01:44:57.958,Trying to cut my throat the slow way.
01:45:01.666,01:45:02.791,You're welcome.
01:45:07.166,01:45:11.166,"And I've got insurance tonight, so no bathroom breaks for me."
01:45:11.250,01:45:16.250,"You missed the whole second act of that last play we went to, and the mockingbird didn't die."
01:45:16.333,01:45:17.291,"Oh, good."
01:45:29.750,01:45:30.750,Radha?
01:45:39.916,01:45:42.625,"It's a really friendly house out there, you guys."
01:45:42.708,01:45:44.541,"-Oh, good. -Yeah, break a leg."
01:45:51.750,01:45:55.958,"-Archie! -Hey, I love the look."
01:45:56.041,01:45:57.916,"Well, thank you. You too."
01:45:58.541,01:46:00.875,-It's five minutes to curtain. -She's on her way.
01:46:01.625,01:46:02.500,I hope so.
01:46:03.041,01:46:06.083,"Actually, I want her to meet the investors for the Shirley Chisholm musical."
01:46:07.291,01:46:09.291,Maybe you could come on as a producer.
01:46:11.375,01:46:15.708,"If by producer, you mean jiggle your balls again, I think I'll pass."
01:46:19.666,01:46:21.333,"Patty, Billy, how are you?"
01:46:21.416,01:46:23.541,Isn't this a wonderful evening?
01:47:20.083,01:47:21.583,Is that supposed to be me?
01:47:24.500,01:47:26.791,"-Oh, my bad. -It's okay."
01:47:52.833,01:47:54.833,"Oh, you're all so wonderful."
01:48:03.791,01:48:07.250,"Baby, I'm not saying I want to go back down south."
01:48:07.333,01:48:10.916,"So... what are you saying, baby?"
01:48:11.000,01:48:14.708,I'm saying it's just getting too expensive to stay here.
01:48:14.791,01:48:17.166,We gots to figure it outs.
01:48:20.750,01:48:24.291,What's a girl gotta do to get some soy milk around here?
01:48:48.875,01:48:50.833,"What are you saying, sir?"
01:48:50.916,01:48:53.166,"Yeah, what are you saying?"
01:48:53.250,01:48:57.125,I'm offering you half a million dollars for your shop.
01:48:59.333,01:49:01.791,"-Yo, this shop means everything to us. -Yeah, everything."
01:49:01.875,01:49:03.791,This shop means everything to me.
01:49:10.333,01:49:13.708,So... what'll it be?
01:49:16.208,01:49:17.041,Baby.
01:49:18.041,01:49:18.875,Honey.
01:49:59.583,01:50:01.875,"The first act was quite powerful, wasn't it?"
01:50:11.750,01:50:13.083,I love that tune.
01:50:15.750,01:50:18.708,Marcus would still be here if it wasn't for you!
01:50:19.583,01:50:20.583,What did I do?
01:50:20.666,01:50:24.208,You came here... to Harlem. That's what you did.
01:50:24.291,01:50:25.208,Mm-hmm.
01:50:26.416,01:50:29.083,I do not accept your energy.
01:50:29.625,01:50:32.583,"I'm not your enemy, I'm your neighbor."
01:50:32.666,01:50:34.916,"Your friend, your..."

01:52:02.416,01:52:04.791,"-Radha, are you here? -Is she here? Did she come?"

01:53:05.875,01:53:08.041,Every playwright hopes...
01:53:08.916,01:53:10.625,every playwright hopes...
01:53:13.333,01:53:16.916,they don't write a piece of shit like this play.
01:53:25.208,01:53:30.833,"My, um... mother raised me to be fearless, and, um..."
01:53:32.291,01:53:34.375,"I guess when she died, I..."
01:53:35.750,01:53:37.791,that's when I started getting afraid.

01:55:19.875,01:55:20.916,-Radha! -No!
01:55:21.000,01:55:24.541,"If you're gonna tell me that I fucked up again, -I don't want to hear it. -Radha, I get it."

01:59:14.958,01:59:17.291,-Mennonite chants. -Oh.
01:59:20.916,01:59:23.083,"-On a serious note, though... -What?"
01:59:23.166,01:59:25.625,"You been... like, you been writing since..."
01:59:36.583,01:59:38.333,-What we doing? -What? What you got?

02:00:44.375,02:00:46.416,I know because I've done it.
02:00:46.500,02:00:57.125,"Been here around this United States, had many lovers, interesting jobs, like coat check girl at the Savoy."

02:01:04.791,02:01:07.291,"For one, I went to Paris."
02:01:09.583,02:01:17.375,"Now, if you ain't gonna come over here and give me some food or some ass, shut the fuck up!"
