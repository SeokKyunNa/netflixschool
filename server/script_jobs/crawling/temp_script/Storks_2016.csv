00:00:33.616,00:00:40.957,"It was our duty, our core belief, the driving force of our very lifeblood."
00:00:44.210,00:00:45.670,Aw... Ow!
00:00:47.922,00:00:48.965,Oh...
00:00:52.260,00:00:53.845,This was our sacred duty.
00:00:54.387,00:01:03.938,"No matter how tough, or impossible, or brutal, or harsh, or inhumane, or savage, we would triumph over adversity."
00:01:06.608,00:01:07.692,Phew!
00:01:33.259,00:01:34.969,There. Right there.
00:01:35.053,00:01:39.724,"The problem was, we had the wrong cargo."
00:01:54.531,00:01:56.950,"-My dude! -Oh, yeah."
00:02:00.954,00:02:02.872,"Yo, Kevron. Lookin' good, my man."
00:02:10.171,00:02:12.298,Perfect landing. Chiggy-check.
00:02:16.261,00:02:18.888,What? Millionth package? Not possible.
00:02:18.972,00:02:20.140,I thought I was only at 20.
00:02:20.223,00:02:21.891,"Hey, Junior, are you gonna celebrate?"
00:02:21.975,00:02:24.644,You know what? You're right. I should celebrate.
00:02:24.769,00:02:26.771,What are you guys doing this weekend? Are you guys free?
00:02:26.855,00:02:29.274,The wife and I are celebrating another anniversary.
00:02:29.357,00:02:30.817,Got my kid's game this weekend.
00:02:30.900,00:02:33.653,Family reunion. The whole family's coming.
00:02:33.987,00:02:36.614,Oh. Just wanted to confirm...
00:02:36.698,00:02:38.533,"that you were all busy. I assumed you were all busy, and you are."
00:02:38.616,00:02:41.369,"So, if anything changes, let me know. I maybe could get out of work."
00:02:41.452,00:02:42.745,"Probably can't, but let me know if you can."
00:02:43.246,00:02:45.540,"Great job out there, brah!"
00:02:50.920,00:02:52.046,She migrated.
00:02:52.130,00:02:53.715,-She's not made up. -Okay.
00:02:53.798,00:02:55.508,Look at her! Look at her!
00:02:55.925,00:02:57.760,"-She exists, brah! -That's great."
00:02:57.844,00:03:00.346,"Hey, did you guys hear about Roger?"
00:03:02.181,00:03:04.058,"Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?"
00:03:04.767,00:03:07.520,"What? Hey, brah. I say... What? Okay."
00:03:07.729,00:03:09.188,I tell you about my girlfriend?
00:03:10.773,00:03:12.567,"Hey, boss wants to see you."
00:03:13.151,00:03:13.985,Uh...
00:03:14.360,00:03:15.778,Hunter wants to see me?
00:03:18.615,00:03:20.783,"All right. Head in the game, Junior."
00:03:20.992,00:03:23.077,"So, you're Hunter. What do you do around here?"
00:03:24.162,00:03:25.288,"No, I hate that."
00:03:27.165,00:03:28.249,"No, that's too robot."
00:03:28.333,00:03:30.460,Just say it normal. Just say it normal. Here we go.
00:03:30.543,00:03:31.419,Nice to meet you.
00:03:37.383,00:03:38.301,Hunter.
00:03:46.100,00:03:50.396,"You know why I built my office entirely out of glass, even though birds can't see glass?"
00:03:50.480,00:03:51.439,I do not.
00:03:56.069,00:04:03.368,"Eighteen years ago, I saved all storks by getting out of babies and into package delivery."
00:04:03.451,00:04:08.164,"Now, this Monday at Storkcon, the board will announce they're kicking me upstairs."
00:04:08.248,00:04:09.332,I'm going to be named chairman.
00:04:09.415,00:04:15.380,Which means you are going to be named boss.
00:04:24.305,00:04:25.807,"Cool, cool, cool. Very cool, very cool."
00:04:25.890,00:04:29.519,"Now, look upon your domain with your eyes wide open."
00:04:31.271,00:04:32.689,I love it. Feels good.
00:04:32.772,00:04:35.149,How can you be boss if you can't look at it?
00:04:35.233,00:04:37.485,"If I go blind, it was worth it."
00:04:37.694,00:04:39.237,You know the hardest thing about being boss?
00:04:39.320,00:04:40.196,Staring at the sun?
00:04:40.280,00:04:41.531,"No, this is easy."
00:04:41.614,00:04:43.992,"Whether to be, like, a friend boss or a distant, weird boss?"
00:04:44.075,00:04:46.119,Always be distant and weird. What's the matter with you?
00:04:46.202,00:04:47.036,Sorry.
00:04:47.120,00:04:50.290,"No, it's dealing with that."
00:04:53.334,00:04:54.335,I don't understand.
00:04:54.419,00:04:57.505,Do you know why we stopped delivering babies?
00:04:57.588,00:04:59.507,Because there are so many other ways of getting babies?
00:04:59.590,00:05:02.802,Yes. But that's not the whole story.
00:05:03.261,00:05:11.269,"Eighteen years ago, when we still delivered human infants, a stork named Jasper went crazy and tried to keep a baby."
00:05:12.312,00:05:14.355,-Tulip's beacon broke. -Oops.
00:05:14.439,00:05:17.942,"Her address was destroyed, so we could no longer deliver her."
00:05:18.026,00:05:19.902,My baby!
00:05:20.111,00:05:24.157,It was then I realized that there was no future in baby delivery.
00:05:24.324,00:05:30.621,"Now, the orphan Tulip has just turned 18, which means we can finally liberate her and return her to the human world."
00:05:30.705,00:05:31.664,But she's no trouble.
00:05:31.748,00:05:33.416,"Oh, she isn't, is she?"
00:05:33.499,00:05:35.376,Here's our profit chart.
00:05:35.460,00:05:37.086,I love a good profit chart.
00:05:37.170,00:05:38.504,"-Me, too. -Yeah."
00:05:38.838,00:05:41.716,"The peaks are when Tulip is on vacation, asleep, or out with the flu."
00:05:41.799,00:05:44.594,The valleys are when she tries to help.
00:05:44.677,00:05:48.222,Cool. I will liberate her. Consider her liberated.
00:05:48.681,00:05:50.266,And if she doesn't want to be liberated?
00:05:50.349,00:05:52.935,-Fire her. I'm talking about firing her. -Really?
00:05:53.019,00:05:56.355,The only thing you need to do to be named boss on Monday is liberate the orphan Tulip.
00:05:56.439,00:05:57.899,"If I'm not being clear, I mean fire her."
00:05:57.982,00:05:59.192,"Yes, sir. I am on it."
00:05:59.275,00:06:01.527,"I have read between the lines, and heard you overtly."
00:06:08.659,00:06:10.703,Excuse me! Orphan Tulip?
00:06:11.996,00:06:12.830,Junior?
00:06:13.873,00:06:15.166,You're talkin' to me?
00:06:16.667,00:06:18.377,"No, it's just that you never talk to me."
00:06:18.461,00:06:20.546,"Well, yeah, that's changing starting today, Orphan Tulip."
00:06:20.630,00:06:22.840,"Oh, Tulip is just fine. Orphan hurts my heart."
00:06:22.924,00:06:24.467,I have so many questions to ask you.
00:06:24.550,00:06:26.844,Why don't you come down and we can talk all day?
00:06:26.928,00:06:28.805,Okay. I will be down.
00:06:28.888,00:06:30.139,As will my friends.
00:06:30.223,00:06:32.600,We are going to fly right down.
00:06:32.683,00:06:33.643,"What? No, no."
00:06:33.768,00:06:35.728,"That's a quail, an emu, there's a chicken."
00:06:35.812,00:06:38.731,-They cannot fly. -Yeah. Until now.
00:06:39.107,00:06:40.316,She's helping us achieve our dreams.
00:06:40.399,00:06:41.859,"-That's right, Dougland. -You know it."
00:06:42.276,00:06:44.654,It is still a personal victory if you use the bucket.
00:06:49.659,00:06:52.411,"-Okay, we'll all not use the bucket. -Wait, what?"
00:06:52.662,00:06:54.872,Ha-ha! Tulip doesn't fit in.
00:06:54.997,00:06:57.250,"We're all the same, and she's a weirdo."
00:06:57.333,00:07:00.378,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not nice. She's-- She's had a hard life."
00:07:01.671,00:07:05.091,Okay.
00:07:05.174,00:07:07.135,"This is gonna be great, guys!"
00:07:08.052,00:07:09.220,Countdown.
00:07:10.012,00:07:12.932,"Three, two, one!"
00:07:22.400,00:07:24.152,It's working. We're flying.
00:07:24.235,00:07:25.862,Ho-ho! Whoa!
00:07:26.404,00:07:27.572,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:28.030,00:07:28.948,Yeah!
00:07:29.323,00:07:31.576,"Enough of this, I wanna go fast!"
00:07:31.826,00:07:34.245,"No! Dougland, wait! No, no, no!"
00:07:34.370,00:07:35.997,This is the greatest day of my life!
00:07:37.832,00:07:39.250,I'm flying!
00:07:42.170,00:07:44.088,This is my moment.
00:07:48.843,00:07:50.011,Bad Dougland! No!
00:07:50.094,00:07:52.680,How could my dreams go so horribly wrong?
00:07:54.265,00:07:55.558,I got ya.
00:07:55.808,00:07:56.809,Okay.
00:07:56.893,00:07:58.019,I'm fallin'.
00:08:17.413,00:08:18.748,"-Uh... -Oh, boy."
00:08:22.376,00:08:24.462,"Oh. Oh, that's not so bad."
00:08:31.219,00:08:32.136,I got it!
00:08:38.351,00:08:42.563,"I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so, so sorry. Oh!"
00:08:42.647,00:08:45.024,"I don't fit in anywhere, and all I want to do is help!"
00:08:49.820,00:08:53.199,"Uh, Tulip, okay. I have news for you."
00:08:53.282,00:08:59.497,"Before you finish, for you to come to wish me a happy birthday, that's just the nicest, you know? It's like a little rainbow."
00:08:59.580,00:09:00.790,"So, thank you."
00:09:04.502,00:09:06.671,-What were you gonna tell me? -Uh...
00:09:06.921,00:09:07.922,"Oh, boy."
00:09:08.005,00:09:10.258,I have wonderful news for you.
00:09:10.591,00:09:13.386,You have been liberated.
00:09:14.262,00:09:15.263,What does that mean?
00:09:15.346,00:09:18.182,"Well, it means that you are..."
00:09:27.608,00:09:29.902,Excuse me. You're fi-i...
00:09:34.240,00:09:35.241,Really?
00:09:35.366,00:09:37.743,Because I just blew up most of the factory.
00:09:37.827,00:09:39.245,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:39.662,00:09:42.164,What a twist! Um...
00:09:42.248,00:09:44.250,"Well, it means..."
00:09:46.002,00:09:48.212,Ohh-h!
00:09:48.963,00:09:51.382,I'm putting you in charge of your very own department.
00:09:51.465,00:09:55.136,You are the new head of Letter Sorting!
00:09:57.972,00:09:59.557,I didn't even know we still got letters.
00:09:59.974,00:10:01.851,We do!
00:10:02.101,00:10:05.688,"-And now, you're in charge of them. -Oh, yes! I will rock this!"
00:10:05.771,00:10:06.897,You will rock this!
00:10:06.981,00:10:08.649,"-Oh, yeah. Rock it hard. -Gonna rock it hard."
00:10:08.733,00:10:10.234,And what's the number one rule?
00:10:10.359,00:10:11.819,Always deliver.
00:10:11.902,00:10:13.696,-Wrong. Never leave this room. -Oh.
00:10:14.030,00:10:15.948,I always thought it was something more like Strength!
00:10:16.032,00:10:18.117,-Determination! -Nope. That's way off.
00:10:18.200,00:10:20.244,Number one rule: Never leave this room.
00:10:20.453,00:10:38.471,"Okay, well, if that-- Bored, bored, bored."
00:10:44.560,00:10:47.146,"So, how was your commute?"
00:10:48.064,00:10:50.816,"Oh, I took the bucket."
00:10:51.150,00:10:52.985,"Me, too. Real backed up."
00:10:55.071,00:10:56.614,You hear about Steve and Gloria?
00:10:56.697,00:10:57.865,What?
00:10:57.948,00:10:59.867,I hear they're an item.
00:11:00.159,00:11:01.118,-No! -Yeah.
00:11:06.248,00:11:07.792,I told you that in confidence.
00:11:09.669,00:11:10.920,"Oh, no, I said it out loud."
00:11:12.421,00:11:13.964,"Sorry, guys. Cat's out of the bag."
00:11:14.048,00:11:15.800,"-Oh, no! -Meow!"
00:11:19.678,00:11:22.014,I've called you both in because I hear you've been having problems.
00:11:22.139,00:11:23.974,-And it's important we have-- -She's the one who started it.
00:11:24.058,00:11:25.059,-How dare you! -How dare you!
00:11:25.142,00:11:26.894,-How dare both of you! You're fired! -You can't fire me.
00:11:26.977,00:11:29.146,"-I just did. -Wait. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean that."
00:11:29.230,00:11:30.815,"-Guys, Group hug. -Group hug."
00:11:30.981,00:11:32.108,Aw.
00:11:35.361,00:11:38.447,I'm hugging myself. Okay.
00:11:47.415,00:11:48.582,"Come in, Ninja Commander."
00:11:48.666,00:11:51.085,"This is Cowboy Astronaut Agent Nate, over."
00:11:56.382,00:11:58.300,"Ninja Team Commander, are you in position?"
00:11:58.384,00:11:59.760,I'm about to launch the assault.
00:12:01.679,00:12:03.639,That's not gonna be a problem.
00:12:06.058,00:12:07.643,Ha-ha! Dr. LeFreeze!
00:12:16.861,00:12:22.867,"You may have me outnumbered 7,000 to 1, but you weren't counting on one thing, I'm not alone."
00:12:22.950,00:12:24.618,"Ninja Force, attack!"
00:12:27.538,00:12:28.414,Ninja Force?
00:12:34.086,00:12:35.588,Ow! Ah!
00:12:36.839,00:12:39.884,"Oh, ow! No! Oh!"
00:12:39.967,00:12:42.052,This is the end.
00:12:52.563,00:12:54.190,Gardner Real Estate. Henry...
00:12:59.612,00:13:01.155,"Ninja Commander, where were you?"
00:13:01.572,00:13:03.032,"-Uh, can you hold one second? -Can you just..."
00:13:03.115,00:13:06.076,You promised me that we were taking down Dr. LeFreeze this afternoon.
00:13:06.494,00:13:09.538,"You didn't show up, and now he controls most of Western Europe."
00:13:09.622,00:13:10.998,Ethnic tension is on the rise.
00:13:12.416,00:13:13.417,Yeah.
00:13:13.501,00:13:16.712,"-We're totally done after this call, okay? -Really?"
00:13:23.010,00:13:23.928,Not even for five minutes.
00:13:24.011,00:13:26.388,"-Oh, look. There's one of our bench ads. -And you know what it says?"
00:13:31.894,00:13:32.978,We do stop for that.
00:13:33.062,00:13:34.104,"I love you, brother."
00:13:34.188,00:13:36.482,It's like we're best friends that live together!
00:13:37.691,00:13:40.110,"And the yield you're gonna get on this house, Kyle..."
00:13:40.194,00:13:42.154,"And that's what we were saying, like you've gotta be up..."
00:13:42.238,00:13:46.158,"Mom, Dad, I've decided I want a baby brother."
00:13:47.618,00:13:49.370,"-Oh, honey, can you... -Can you hold one second?"
00:13:49.995,00:13:51.372,-Oh... -Um...
00:13:51.705,00:13:53.707,I think we're fine as a family of three.
00:13:53.791,00:13:54.959,Why can't I have one?
00:13:55.042,00:13:56.919,Let's make this easy. Where do you get one?
00:13:59.713,00:14:01.799,Why are you laughing and not answering me?
00:14:06.303,00:14:09.848,"Okay, so there's a super weird vibe in this car right now."
00:14:09.932,00:14:12.268,"Oh, honey, this is very sweet."
00:14:12.351,00:14:13.310,But we have you.
00:14:13.394,00:14:15.646,And that's all we need.
00:14:15.729,00:14:16.689,That's right.
00:14:35.124,00:14:36.584,You can call us anytime.
00:14:39.670,00:14:41.463,"No, we will pick up the phone on Christmas."
00:15:19.418,00:15:21.837,our adult names are Henry and Sarah.
00:15:22.212,00:15:26.133,We are adult parents of an absolutely perfect son named Nate.
00:15:26.216,00:15:28.010,He really deserves a baby brother.
00:15:29.428,00:15:34.433,"As adults, it is our adult belief that it would be irresponsible if this baby did not have ninja skills."
00:15:34.892,00:15:38.979,"Sincerely, adult parents, Henry and Sarah Gardner, adults."
00:15:39.063,00:15:40.773,Not Nate.
00:15:41.482,00:15:43.943,P.S.: He has to have ninja skills!
00:15:44.443,00:15:45.444,Hi-ya!
00:15:47.905,00:15:48.864,Nailed it.
00:17:02.271,00:17:03.564,but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
00:17:04.857,00:17:06.233,Aha! A letter!
00:17:08.277,00:17:09.820,The H.I. Department.
00:17:09.903,00:17:11.321,Don't know that one.
00:17:11.572,00:17:13.657,He said the number one rule is Don't leave.
00:17:14.283,00:17:18.162,"But if I don't deliver the letter, I won't be doing my job."
00:17:23.292,00:17:24.877,I have taken care of the Tulip problem.
00:17:25.753,00:17:26.587,Wonderful.
00:17:27.421,00:17:29.590,"Monday, it'll all be yours."
00:17:38.432,00:17:41.101,Do you know what we'll do when you're boss?
00:17:41.268,00:17:42.478,No. Tell me.
00:17:44.146,00:17:46.648,We'll point at things together. We'll team-build together.
00:17:46.732,00:17:49.026,We'll wear suits together.
00:17:49.109,00:17:52.446,"You'll never be alone, because Cornerstore is your family."
00:17:53.447,00:17:54.948,-What? -And I'll be like your dad.
00:17:55.032,00:17:56.408,And you're like my son.
00:17:56.700,00:17:58.535,My son-ployee.
00:17:58.786,00:17:59.995,And like any family...
00:18:00.079,00:18:01.622,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:18:01.747,00:18:04.083,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:18:04.166,00:18:05.501,How do you turn this thing off?
00:18:08.170,00:18:09.421,Why are there so many screens?
00:18:09.797,00:18:11.298,"Turn off, turn off, turn off!"
00:18:11.381,00:18:13.467,You're about to get everything you ever wanted.
00:18:18.347,00:18:19.807,"Great convo, Hunter."
00:18:22.768,00:18:23.811,I'm so stupid.
00:18:23.894,00:18:25.771,I should have just fired her. Why didn't I just fire her?
00:18:29.108,00:18:31.235,"Hey, what are you doing out of the room? I told you not to leave the room."
00:18:31.318,00:18:33.362,"Nah, it's cool. I'm covering for myself."
00:18:33.445,00:18:35.656,"What? Okay, we need to get outta here."
00:18:37.324,00:18:38.367,Come on. We have to go now.
00:18:38.450,00:18:41.954,"Junior, you asked me to do a thing, and I will not fail you."
00:18:42.162,00:18:43.831,Always deliver.
00:18:43.914,00:18:45.999,Wait! No!
00:18:53.590,00:18:54.925,This is the baby factory!
00:18:55.008,00:18:57.761,This is the baby factory?
00:19:07.020,00:19:08.313,Stop celebrating.
00:19:08.397,00:19:10.399,I think it was supposed to go over there.
00:19:12.568,00:19:15.779,Ohh-h...
00:19:16.780,00:19:18.115,You're right. That was wrong.
00:19:26.957,00:19:28.167,"Oh, come on."
00:19:28.250,00:19:30.377,Why didn't we destroy this place years ago?
00:19:30.586,00:19:32.588,"Oh, my gosh. I can't believe what I'm seeing."
00:19:32.671,00:19:33.839,Do you see all this?
00:19:33.922,00:19:35.841,"Junior, this is amazing."
00:19:42.806,00:19:44.975,Why put the button there? Uh...
00:19:50.772,00:19:51.607,Come on.
00:19:55.861,00:19:57.487,Hi-ya!
00:20:07.122,00:20:07.956,Is it off?
00:20:08.040,00:20:09.583,"Uh, I believe so."
00:20:09.666,00:20:10.959,Are you okay?
00:20:11.043,00:20:13.587,Your wing looks a little mangled.
00:20:13.670,00:20:16.465,My wing is fine. It's A-O-great.
00:20:17.257,00:20:19.009,"Yeah, that seems bad."
00:20:19.092,00:20:20.177,Let's go.
00:20:20.260,00:20:21.887,This place is dangerous.
00:20:26.892,00:20:28.727,Huh. What is that?
00:20:31.480,00:20:32.940,Cool beans.
00:20:37.027,00:20:38.237,"-What's happening? -Mom, Dad."
00:20:38.320,00:20:40.530,The storks are bringing me a baby brother!
00:20:43.075,00:20:45.160,"Let's go back to sleep, honey."
00:20:45.244,00:20:47.829,This is the best day of my life!
00:20:47.913,00:20:49.790,This is the worst day of my life!
00:20:49.873,00:20:51.250,Hunter's gonna kill me.
00:20:53.460,00:20:55.629,"If anyone finds out about this, I am dead meat."
00:20:55.712,00:20:57.214,My hopes of becoming boss destroyed.
00:21:10.269,00:21:11.186,What up?
00:21:11.353,00:21:13.021,"-Hey, Pigeon Toady. -Hey, there."
00:21:13.105,00:21:14.856,"Hey, cool metal thing, brah."
00:21:14.940,00:21:16.775,New kind of package? What's in it?
00:21:16.858,00:21:18.360,-Candy canes. -Some gas. Uh...
00:21:20.862,00:21:22.990,"Cool, brah. You catch the game last night?"
00:21:23.115,00:21:24.783,"-Oh, yeah. Real great game. -Excellent playing."
00:21:24.866,00:21:26.535,"Yeah, too bad about the last quarter."
00:21:26.618,00:21:28.912,"-Yeah, that was too bad. -Real bummer."
00:21:28.996,00:21:31.623,"And yet then, with a little time left, we pulled it out..."
00:21:31.707,00:21:32.708,-Totally. -Yeah.
00:21:32.791,00:21:35.043,...only to lose it again in the last second.
00:21:35.127,00:21:36.670,-Such a disappointment. -It was a comedown.
00:21:36.753,00:21:38.505,-Only to get it back. -Best day of my life!
00:21:38.588,00:21:40.340,-Only to lose it. -Worst day of my life.
00:21:40.424,00:21:41.383,Only to get it back.
00:21:41.466,00:21:44.845,-A roller-coaster of a game. -Only to lose it again.
00:21:44.928,00:21:46.596,What a game! Here we go. See you later.
00:21:47.764,00:21:49.433,Cool. No big deal.
00:21:50.350,00:21:52.019,Wait... Wait a second.
00:21:52.102,00:21:55.272,There was no game last night.
00:21:55.355,00:22:02.529,What the-- Come on. Let's get to my workshop.
00:22:02.612,00:22:03.989,We'll be safe there.
00:22:08.660,00:22:10.287,"All right, okay, all right, all right."
00:22:10.370,00:22:11.872,It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
00:22:11.955,00:22:14.291,We just need to keep a low-pro here. Okay?
00:22:15.000,00:22:19.212,"If one person sees a stork with a baby, my chances of being named boss are ruined. So..."
00:22:19.296,00:22:20.464,Whoa! What are you doing?
00:22:20.547,00:22:21.840,"-I wanna see the baby. -No, no, no."
00:22:21.923,00:22:22.758,We do not open that thing.
00:22:22.841,00:22:25.260,Just a brief exposure to baby cuteness can ruin your life.
00:22:25.343,00:22:26.261,Remember Jasper?
00:22:27.596,00:22:29.931,Hmm. I'm trying to put my finger on it. I can't think of who...
00:22:30.015,00:22:31.850,You're being sarcastic because he changed the course of your life.
00:22:31.933,00:22:33.018,-That's right. -Yeah.
00:22:37.397,00:22:40.567,"Huh. All right, Storkcon is on Monday. Today is Friday."
00:22:40.692,00:22:44.071,"If I can just deliver this thing by then, I can still be named boss."
00:22:44.654,00:22:47.407,"Gardner family, here I come."
00:22:48.617,00:22:52.871,-But your wing's broken. You can't-- -Make a plan. Stick to the plan.
00:22:52.954,00:22:55.123,Always deliver!
00:23:07.969,00:23:10.013,-What's that? -Hmm? What's what?
00:23:11.640,00:23:13.850,"Uh... Oh, that?"
00:23:13.934,00:23:15.102,That's nothing.
00:23:15.185,00:23:18.355,"-Looks like an airplane. -Well, it kind of is an airplane, I guess."
00:23:18.438,00:23:19.523,Great. I'll use it.
00:23:19.606,00:23:26.655,"Oh, well, it kind of took me a long time to make, like, years and years-- I'm saving it for something else."
00:23:26.738,00:23:27.989,-For what? -Hmm?
00:23:28.073,00:23:29.616,What were you gonna use it for?
00:23:34.204,00:23:37.374,"Oh, well, hey there, kid."
00:23:37.666,00:23:42.087,Now's your chance.
00:23:42.420,00:23:44.089,"-Uh, I don't know. -Yeah."
00:23:44.172,00:23:46.174,I don't even know if it flies.
00:23:46.591,00:23:47.926,"Eh, uh..."
00:23:53.515,00:23:54.558,You know what?
00:23:54.683,00:23:57.018,"Yeah, you can use it. Let's deliver this baby."
00:23:57.227,00:23:58.520,Are you sure though?
00:23:58.603,00:24:00.564,"-Uh-- -All right, let's do it."
00:24:01.940,00:24:03.316,"Okay, great. Let me show you how to fly this."
00:24:03.441,00:24:05.694,"Um, hello? I'm a bird."
00:24:05.777,00:24:11.199,I'm pretty sure I know how to-- I was wrong! I was immediately wrong!
00:24:16.371,00:24:18.456,"Of course, the autopilot button. That makes perfect sense."
00:24:19.166,00:24:20.167,I knew that. I was testing you.
00:24:26.339,00:24:28.091,Whoo. What else do you want to talk about?
00:24:28.842,00:24:30.302,My baby.
00:24:31.720,00:24:34.764,"Now, I really think you're gonna love this one, Becky."
00:24:34.848,00:24:36.308,I think we found you a good one.
00:24:36.391,00:24:39.436,"Yeah, when we saw this, we looked at each other, and we were like, Wow."
00:24:39.519,00:24:40.937,This is theirs. Yeah.
00:24:41.021,00:24:42.230,-And it's a fixer-upper... -Yeah. It is.
00:24:42.314,00:24:43.732,...which I know we weren't looking for.
00:24:49.321,00:24:51.740,"Oh, honey, can you just-- -Can you hold one second? -Yeah, can you?"
00:24:51.823,00:24:53.325,"-You're up. You're up. -What? No, it's not my turn."
00:24:58.079,00:24:59.122,Uh...
00:24:59.414,00:25:00.665,Nate?
00:25:02.500,00:25:03.501,What?
00:25:03.585,00:25:04.502,Nate?
00:25:06.338,00:25:08.048,"Hey there, buddy."
00:25:08.548,00:25:09.758,Whatcha doin' here?
00:25:09.841,00:25:10.717,I'm preparing.
00:25:10.800,00:25:12.093,"Right, you're preparing."
00:25:13.970,00:25:15.764,To get my baby brother from the storks.
00:25:18.433,00:25:19.559,Right.
00:25:19.643,00:25:26.650,"Hey, I love your school encourages imagination over actual learning, -but the storks don't deliver anymore. -I know."
00:25:26.733,00:25:28.485,"They haven't done that in, like, forever."
00:25:28.568,00:25:30.153,"Dad, you don't have to help me at all."
00:25:30.237,00:25:32.906,This is a guilt-free pass for you to go back inside and work.
00:25:32.989,00:25:33.823,Just go.
00:25:33.907,00:25:36.618,"-Go. Shoo, shoo, Dad. Go. -What?"
00:25:37.452,00:25:38.536,"Okay, all right. Fine."
00:25:38.620,00:25:39.829,You blink and I'll be in college.
00:25:39.913,00:25:40.872,What was that?
00:25:40.956,00:25:43.917,"Hmm? No, I'm just walking, working."
00:25:44.000,00:25:46.336,-I didn't say anything. You should just-- -Okay.
00:25:46.419,00:25:48.546,Remember when I was a baby? It felt like one minute ago?
00:25:48.630,00:25:50.882,-What? -What? Hmm?
00:25:51.758,00:25:52.592,Fine.
00:25:52.676,00:25:54.261,"Dad, you'll be my idol for, like, two more years."
00:25:54.344,00:25:55.679,"Okay, I heard that one."
00:25:55.762,00:25:57.597,"Okay. All right, look."
00:25:57.681,00:26:01.101,"Five minutes. That's all the time I have is five minutes, and then we stop."
00:26:01.184,00:26:02.435,"Yeah, five minutes."
00:26:02.519,00:26:03.853,"Five minutes, and then..."
00:26:03.937,00:26:04.896,We stop.
00:26:10.944,00:26:12.112,Powder?
00:26:13.446,00:26:14.990,Baby powder.
00:26:15.156,00:26:17.659,Homing pigeon powers activate.
00:26:38.638,00:26:40.056,"No, we are delivering a package."
00:26:40.140,00:26:42.642,Maybe we should name it instead of calling it the package.
00:26:42.767,00:26:44.477,"We do not name the package, okay?"
00:26:44.561,00:26:45.478,It's very simple.
00:26:45.562,00:26:47.522,We make a plan. Stick to the plan.
00:26:47.605,00:26:49.232,Always deliver.
00:26:49.316,00:26:52.610,And then we get back to Storkcon so the board can name me boss.
00:26:52.694,00:26:54.029,"Oh, it's so exciting."
00:26:54.112,00:26:55.780,What can we expect from boss Junior?
00:26:57.949,00:26:59.534,-You can tell me. Come on. -It's gonna be big.
00:26:59.617,00:27:01.369,"Like what? Like, what, how big? Like, what are you gonna do?"
00:27:03.538,00:27:04.706,-Do you not know? -What?
00:27:08.001,00:27:09.127,-I know. -You don't.
00:27:09.210,00:27:11.629,"Oh, man, you laugh when you're uncomfortable."
00:27:12.672,00:27:14.549,"-Am I pushing your buttons? -Uh, no."
00:27:14.632,00:27:16.051,"-Yes, I am. -Nah. No."
00:27:16.176,00:27:19.721,"-Beep, beep, boop, boop... -No, those aren't even where my buttons would be if I had buttons."
00:27:19.804,00:27:21.514,"-Beep, beep, boop, boop... -So, nice try."
00:27:26.644,00:27:27.896,We're having a good time together.
00:27:27.979,00:27:29.356,Why do you wanna be boss? Why do you wanna be boss?
00:27:31.608,00:27:32.650,"Oh, God! No!"
00:27:38.323,00:27:41.201,"Wow! Well, that was funny."
00:27:42.744,00:27:47.290,"I guess the lesson we learned today is don't ask me why I want to be boss, right?"
00:27:53.463,00:27:54.589,That didn't sound happy.
00:27:54.672,00:27:57.384,"Yeah, well, the package will be delivered soon enough."
00:27:59.052,00:28:01.137,"I really think that we should check that out, you know."
00:28:01.221,00:28:02.097,"Ah, just relax."
00:28:02.180,00:28:03.264,"Okay. Yeah, you're right."
00:28:07.769,00:28:12.273,"Ah, you see, the package has cried itself gently to sleep."
00:28:24.244,00:28:25.453,I can't take it.
00:28:26.246,00:28:28.206,Can't help body movements. Must open pod.
00:28:28.289,00:28:31.209,-Wait. No. -The pod. Gotta open the pod!
00:28:35.296,00:28:36.756,-Fly this plane. -Gotta open the pod!
00:28:55.734,00:28:57.026,"Well, at least the baby's quiet."
00:28:57.110,00:28:58.319,Are you out of your mind?
00:28:58.403,00:28:59.988,A baby cries and you crash a plane?
00:29:00.071,00:29:02.115,"Hey, hey, hey. I was busy with the pod."
00:29:02.198,00:29:03.575,Why didn't you turn on the autopilot?
00:29:03.658,00:29:05.118,Why didn't you turn on the autopilot?
00:29:05.243,00:29:07.328,"I was panicking! Listen to me, Tulip."
00:29:07.412,00:29:09.122,"-You crashed a plane, did you hear me? -The baby is quiet."
00:29:09.205,00:29:10.749,-You crashed a plane! -The baby is quiet.
00:29:10.832,00:29:12.459,-The baby is quiet? -The baby is quiet!
00:29:12.542,00:29:13.752,"-Why didn't you say anything? -Oh, no."
00:29:13.835,00:29:15.795,Why is it quiet?
00:29:15.879,00:29:18.173,Open the pod! Open the pod! Open the pod! Open the pod!
00:29:18.256,00:29:20.341,How do you open this thing? How do you open it? Come on.
00:29:28.391,00:29:29.976,"Oh, my gosh. You know what I just realized?"
00:29:30.059,00:29:31.519,This baby and I have the same birthday.
00:29:31.853,00:29:33.730,"Oh, yeah. I don't care."
00:29:33.813,00:29:35.565,You crashed the plane. I don't need you anymore.
00:29:35.648,00:29:38.401,I'm going to deliver the package myself. Goodbye.
00:29:38.818,00:29:40.737,What? You're breaking up the team?
00:29:41.070,00:29:43.573,Team? What is wrong with you?
00:29:43.656,00:29:45.784,You and I are not a team. We are nothing.
00:29:45.867,00:29:47.285,There is no we.
00:29:47.368,00:29:48.703,This is all your fault. This.
00:29:55.710,00:29:57.378,"A good day to you, Orphan Tulip."
00:29:57.462,00:29:59.047,A good day.
00:29:59.547,00:30:02.217,"Well, just so you know, I'll be fine."
00:30:04.219,00:30:08.306,I'm the most popular person in the entire Letter Sorting department.
00:30:15.772,00:30:16.731,but I assume it's lame.
00:30:16.898,00:30:27.575,I said I'm the most popular person-- Tulip's dumb.
00:30:27.659,00:30:29.577,There's a reason she doesn't fit in.
00:30:29.744,00:30:32.622,"If you're smart enough to build a plane, then who wrecks one?"
00:30:32.705,00:30:35.375,I'm gonna deliver this package and be back at Stork Mountain in no time.
00:30:45.802,00:30:48.721,"Oh, great. Now I'm surrounded by wolves."
00:30:48.805,00:30:51.140,"What are you gonna do, knock me unconscious?"
00:31:04.529,00:31:05.780,"Oh, seriously?"
00:31:05.864,00:31:07.782,I'm not talking to you. I'm mad at you.
00:31:09.617,00:31:11.578,We are done. This conversation is over.
00:31:11.661,00:31:12.537,"Last word, me!"
00:31:12.620,00:31:13.621,-Last word. -Me.
00:31:13.705,00:31:15.206,-Last word. Last word. -Me. Me. Me.
00:31:28.011,00:31:29.929,"Listen, I'm the alpha. I'm gonna eat this thing first."
00:31:30.013,00:31:31.180,I'm gonna be the new alpha.
00:31:31.264,00:31:34.767,No. There is no... There's no need for a new alpha.
00:31:34.851,00:31:35.894,I'm the alpha.
00:31:35.977,00:31:37.395,-You? -You're not even a beta.
00:31:37.478,00:31:39.814,"-I'm the alpha! -No, you're not the alpha!"
00:31:47.864,00:31:50.450,-What was that? -What did that thing just do?
00:31:52.744,00:31:54.829,"-I'm sorry. Where were we? -Oh, yeah."
00:31:57.040,00:31:58.333,I'm gonna devour this thing.
00:31:58.416,00:32:00.668,I'm gonna bite her arm clean off.
00:32:07.258,00:32:08.384,You didn't bite her arm clean off.
00:32:08.468,00:32:09.802,This tastes like flowers.
00:32:09.886,00:32:11.179,"Okay, stand aside."
00:32:15.308,00:32:16.726,Look at you. Look what you did.
00:32:16.809,00:32:18.353,I did the same thing you did.
00:32:21.689,00:32:22.774,-Are you in love? -I am in love.
00:32:22.857,00:32:24.067,"-Are you in love? -I'm in love, too."
00:32:24.150,00:32:25.318,I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree.
00:32:25.401,00:32:26.945,"Hey, guys."
00:32:27.028,00:32:29.280,"This tiny thing is now a wolf, everybody."
00:32:31.866,00:32:33.910,"-We're keeping it. -Back of the pack, we're keeping it."
00:32:33.993,00:32:35.161,"Okay, thank you."
00:32:35.244,00:32:37.205,"Aw, look at that. The delivery is now complete."
00:32:37.288,00:32:38.498,"Now, I just need to find a way out of here."
00:32:38.581,00:32:41.376,"Wait, you're not gonna deliver her to her actual parents?"
00:32:41.459,00:32:43.503,Baby doesn't know the difference because babies are dumb.
00:32:43.586,00:32:45.797,"-Oh, babies are not dumb. -They are super dumb."
00:32:45.880,00:32:48.758,Babies have a higher level of intelligence than we will ever understand.
00:32:48.841,00:32:50.468,You sound like a baby that learned how to talk.
00:32:50.551,00:32:51.844,I am a baby that learned how to talk.
00:32:51.928,00:32:55.932,"Hey, I want to teach it to walk around in circles -before it lays down. -Yes. Yes. Yes."
00:32:56.015,00:32:57.016,That's my favorite thing to teach.
00:32:57.100,00:32:58.267,"Don't get too close, you're gonna scare it."
00:32:58.351,00:32:59.352,I'm not-- Ow!
00:33:02.063,00:33:06.150,"-Huh. The baby, it's laughing. -Yeah. Good for it."
00:33:06.234,00:33:07.652,No.
00:33:11.823,00:33:12.949,-Ow! -Sorry.
00:33:14.117,00:33:15.243,-Stop it. -Sorry.
00:33:17.787,00:33:19.163,-That's my face. -Sorry.
00:33:23.543,00:33:24.919,-Why did you stop? -Come on.
00:33:25.003,00:33:27.130,"Okay, I get the plan. I can fake it. I can fake it."
00:33:27.213,00:33:28.798,"Okay, okay. Fake it."
00:33:28.881,00:33:30.049,Ow!
00:33:34.804,00:33:36.014,"All right, I have an idea."
00:33:36.097,00:33:39.392,Imagine how much harder she could hit me if you cut us down.
00:33:39.517,00:33:41.853,"Oh, yeah. I could really wail on this guy."
00:33:41.936,00:33:44.188,"I mean, you don't have to go that hard, but..."
00:33:44.272,00:33:46.232,"-Oh, I think I do. -Well..."
00:33:46.315,00:33:47.942,"Oh, I'm still mad at you."
00:33:48.151,00:33:49.610,Cut 'em down!
00:33:52.447,00:33:54.490,"-Grab a stick or something. -Wait, what?"
00:33:59.162,00:34:01.080,Do you want more?
00:34:02.415,00:34:05.084,Will this tiny twig be enough?
00:34:07.420,00:34:09.922,-Bigger! -Get the biggest twig you can find!
00:34:10.006,00:34:13.051,"Sorry, Junior. Gotta give the people what they want."
00:34:31.486,00:34:33.112,Oh! Oh! We should untie the bridge.
00:34:33.321,00:34:34.739,"Yeah, I know. What do you think I'm doing?"
00:34:37.492,00:34:39.077,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
00:34:41.704,00:34:46.125,Wolf pack! Form of wolf bridge!
00:34:47.877,00:34:49.587,"Hut, hut, hut."
00:34:59.013,00:35:00.556,What is happening?
00:35:02.266,00:35:03.768,-How is that possible? -I don't know.
00:35:03.851,00:35:04.977,"All right, let's go."
00:35:26.749,00:35:28.626,"Oh, my gosh. We can use that thing as a thing."
00:35:28.709,00:35:30.169,Right. To thing to the thing.
00:35:32.421,00:35:34.340,-You sound like a monkey. -You sound like a monkey!
00:35:34.423,00:35:38.052,"Wolf pack, form of wolf boat!"
00:35:41.013,00:35:43.933,-Are you kidding me? -That is so unpredictable.
00:35:44.016,00:35:45.017,Ha-ha.
00:36:14.839,00:36:16.757,I didn't know wolves could form a submarine.
00:36:16.883,00:36:18.342,I've never seen that before on nature shows.
00:36:19.010,00:36:20.761,"Okay, quick, get to the plane."
00:36:22.138,00:36:23.890,"No, I fixed it with some spare parts."
00:36:23.973,00:36:27.226,We're gonna get ya. We're gonna get ya.
00:36:32.565,00:36:33.649,"All right, let's go."
00:36:41.324,00:36:42.700,Wait.
00:36:43.451,00:36:44.952,"Oh, I could push it so easily."
00:36:45.036,00:36:46.996,It would take such a little amount of force.
00:36:50.750,00:36:52.043,Don't look at me like that.
00:36:54.879,00:36:57.673,"If you don't give us Tiny Thing, we're gonna eat you."
00:36:57.757,00:36:59.050,We're gonna eat you anyway.
00:36:59.133,00:37:00.509,You don't say it.
00:37:00.593,00:37:02.720,You make the deal and then you eat them anyway.
00:37:02.803,00:37:03.888,Gotcha.
00:37:03.971,00:37:05.139,We're not going to eat you.
00:37:05.264,00:37:07.016,"Well, now it's too late."
00:37:13.064,00:37:14.357,"All right, let's fly."
00:37:14.440,00:37:15.650,It doesn't fly.
00:37:15.733,00:37:17.109,-What? -It falls.
00:37:31.707,00:37:34.502,Wolf pack! Form of wolf plane!
00:37:39.173,00:37:41.217,"-Come on, come on. -Let's go."
00:37:46.931,00:37:48.599,"Tiny Thing, come back."
00:37:48.683,00:37:51.811,"Oh, come back, Tiny Thing. We need you."
00:37:53.396,00:37:55.064,My baby.
00:38:10.538,00:38:11.372,What?
00:38:14.083,00:38:14.917,What?
00:38:18.838,00:38:21.507,That's our chimney. You're gonna destroy the whole roof?
00:38:21.590,00:38:26.012,"Mom, we have to replace the chimney with a slide for when the storks deliver my baby brother."
00:38:26.095,00:38:27.013,What he said.
00:38:27.096,00:38:29.890,No. Don't be crazy. You cannot do the chimney.
00:38:29.974,00:38:31.475,"Come on, don't make me the mean mom."
00:38:31.559,00:38:33.602,"-Dads are fun, moms are mean. -I heard that."
00:38:35.896,00:38:37.773,"Henry, people are gonna think we're crazy."
00:38:37.857,00:38:39.275,We need to tell him.
00:38:39.358,00:38:40.192,Tell him what?
00:38:40.276,00:38:42.069,"What, to go watch more TV?"
00:38:42.153,00:38:44.864,This is the best time I've had with Nate in my life.
00:38:44.947,00:38:46.115,I actually feel like a dad again.
00:38:46.198,00:38:48.409,And when no baby brother shows up?
00:38:48.701,00:38:50.619,"Well, then we tell him."
00:38:50.703,00:38:53.998,"We can get a new chimney, but we'll never be able to replace this time with Nate."
00:38:54.540,00:38:58.544,"And if we put those headsets back on, how old will Nate be when we take them off again?"
00:38:58.627,00:38:59.920,I'm not a jerky teen yet.
00:39:00.004,00:39:02.173,"Fleeting moments, precious memories."
00:39:14.643,00:39:16.187,"Moms are fun, too."
00:39:20.149,00:39:22.693,Wow! That's... That's not a well-made chimney.
00:39:22.777,00:39:24.737,"I'm... I'm a small woman,, and that just came..."
00:39:24.820,00:39:26.530,"Yeah, that came right down."
00:39:31.535,00:39:33.871,"Okay, so, uh, what's next?"
00:39:33.954,00:39:35.289,"Okay, it's Saturday night."
00:39:35.373,00:39:38.584,"As long as we deliver by tomorrow, we can still make it for Storkcon Monday."
00:39:40.044,00:39:42.046,Thanks for waiting for me back there.
00:39:42.797,00:39:43.798,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:39:47.510,00:39:48.594,Is that supposed to be me?
00:39:51.806,00:39:54.517,"Oh, you're so right. That is what I sound like."
00:39:54.600,00:39:56.310,Let's both talk like this.
00:40:01.482,00:40:03.401,She's bored. We have to distract her.
00:40:03.484,00:40:04.985,"Oh, let's see. Oh."
00:40:11.659,00:40:12.785,"Let's just step aside, all right?"
00:40:12.868,00:40:14.453,-And let me do it. -You want to sing to her?
00:40:14.537,00:40:15.955,Yeah. Is that so surprising?
00:40:16.038,00:40:17.456,"I'm a pretty good singer, actually."
00:40:17.540,00:40:19.375,"Okay, fine. Sing to her."
00:40:30.719,00:40:32.221,Free shipping does not apply in Alaska and Hawaii.
00:40:32.304,00:40:33.931,"Wait, wait, wait, is that a song?"
00:40:34.014,00:40:35.057,"That's not a song, that's an ad."
00:40:35.141,00:40:37.768,"-Well, strap in for this one then, Tulip. -Okay."
00:40:39.645,00:40:40.688,I like how this is going.
00:40:55.911,00:40:58.789,"Uh, this looks like a good place to rest for the night."
00:40:59.039,00:41:01.709,"Junior, what are talking about? Why are you acting-- I can't hear what you're saying."
00:41:01.792,00:41:03.461,-Junior? -I can't hear you.
00:41:16.849,00:41:18.684,Hmm...
00:41:20.728,00:41:23.647,Hey. Have you seen a red-headed lady and a stork?
00:41:23.731,00:41:25.065,A bird and a lady?
00:41:25.149,00:41:26.775,I don't know what you're talkin' about.
00:41:26.859,00:41:29.778,I saw two that fit that description the other day.
00:41:31.489,00:41:32.907,"No, man, I will not be your friend."
00:41:33.365,00:41:35.409,"Sorry, thought we were vibing."
00:41:51.550,00:41:53.260,Why you being so creepy?
00:42:02.561,00:42:05.231,You know what? Just get... Here. Here.
00:42:11.570,00:42:12.655,Yeah.
00:42:16.909,00:42:17.910,Uh...
00:42:18.619,00:42:19.954,What happened back there?
00:42:20.037,00:42:21.080,What? What do you mean?
00:42:21.163,00:42:26.293,"Uh, you stabbed the raft? For literally no reason, It was not for no reason. It was for personal reasons."
00:42:26.377,00:42:29.088,"Anyways, there's a port right there on the coast."
00:42:29.171,00:42:32.007,"We'll just leave first thing in the morning, and deliver the package."
00:42:33.467,00:42:35.052,Just call it the baby.
00:42:35.135,00:42:36.720,Why are you so afraid of babies?
00:42:36.804,00:42:40.140,Because this one single package could ruin everything I've worked towards my entire life!
00:42:42.560,00:42:44.687,"No, really. Why do you wanna be boss of Cornerstore?"
00:42:47.898,00:42:49.233,Why does anyone want to be boss?
00:42:49.316,00:42:50.776,It rules. That's why.
00:42:50.859,00:42:52.695,"Yeah, but what would you do?"
00:42:52.778,00:42:55.322,-I don't know. What would you do? -I'm glad you asked.
00:42:55.406,00:42:58.659,"Well, for one, I would employ a more diverse variety of birds and animals."
00:42:58.742,00:43:02.454,"Two, I would get rid of the Cornerstore warehouse, because that building is a bummer."
00:43:02.538,00:43:05.249,"And three, I would start delivering babies again."
00:43:07.668,00:43:09.128,"Okay, you were very prepared for that question."
00:43:09.211,00:43:11.505,"Man, I feel so close to you. Like we're girlfriends already."
00:43:11.589,00:43:14.633,"All right, I knew as I was saying it, that I should just keep my mouth shut."
00:43:14.717,00:43:17.428,"Aw, I want to braid your feathers immediately."
00:43:28.188,00:43:29.315,Yeah?
00:43:30.274,00:43:33.569,"While we're being real honest right now, I'll tell you why I built my plane."
00:43:33.902,00:43:36.572,It's not to deliver packages for Cornerstore.com.
00:43:37.656,00:43:39.825,I built my plane to find my parents.
00:43:51.712,00:43:52.921,Except one.
00:43:55.174,00:43:59.345,"And I thought this, plus some luck might be enough to find my parents."
00:43:59.762,00:44:03.098,"So, you sacrificed your plane for this baby?"
00:44:05.267,00:44:10.773,"Oh, I don't know. I guess if this baby finds her family, I mean, it's worth it."
00:44:11.732,00:44:12.566,Right?
00:44:14.318,00:44:16.654,Fine. You can name her.
00:44:16.737,00:44:18.238,"-Really? -Yeah, go ahead."
00:44:18.322,00:44:19.156,Diamond Destiny.
00:44:19.239,00:44:20.532,"Okay, I changed my mind. You can't name her."
00:44:20.616,00:44:22.159,"Too late. Her name is Diamond Destiny. Yes, it is."
00:44:22.242,00:44:23.827,"I thought it was gonna be, like, an actual name."
00:44:23.911,00:44:25.704,It is a name. Diamond Destiny is her name.
00:44:25.788,00:44:27.665,"Isn't that right, Diamond Destiny?"
00:44:27.748,00:44:32.336,"We're gonna find your parents, and everything is gonna be just perfect."
00:44:35.130,00:44:36.340,You'll find your family.
00:44:36.799,00:44:37.925,You think?
00:44:38.008,00:44:39.134,For sure.
00:44:39.635,00:44:41.011,Good night.
00:44:41.637,00:44:43.055,Good night.
00:44:49.770,00:44:51.105,What is it? I'm up.
00:44:51.188,00:44:52.856,Do you think she's hungry?
00:44:52.940,00:44:54.149,Yeah. I don't know.
00:44:54.233,00:44:56.276,"Uh, maybe she just needs to be rocked."
00:44:57.027,00:44:58.028,Okay.
00:45:04.785,00:45:06.328,Her eyes could not be more open.
00:45:06.412,00:45:08.038,"Okay, grab that end."
00:45:11.750,00:45:13.043,It's like we're a family.
00:45:13.127,00:45:14.336,We are not like a family.
00:45:17.923,00:45:19.466,Let's just put her to sleep.
00:45:19.967,00:45:21.760,"Come on, close, close, close."
00:45:39.945,00:45:42.656,What if she never goes to sleep?
00:45:42.739,00:45:44.116,"All right, you know what? I got her."
00:45:44.199,00:45:45.659,You just go to bed. You go to bed. It's fine.
00:45:45.742,00:45:48.328,"No, I don't wanna go to bed if you're gonna be up. I'll feel bad."
00:45:48.412,00:45:50.873,"I know. But if I go to bed, then I'm gonna feel guilty. And I just can't."
00:45:52.124,00:45:55.252,"No, so that's why you go to bed, and I'll take care of her."
00:45:56.712,00:45:58.338,All right. I'll go to bed.
00:45:58.922,00:46:00.382,I can't believe you went to bed!
00:46:00.466,00:46:02.593,What? You just said it was okay for me to go bed.
00:46:02.676,00:46:03.594,"Okay, you know what?"
00:46:03.677,00:46:05.053,Can we just rock her in our arms?
00:46:05.137,00:46:07.139,No. We do not. No loving the baby.
00:46:07.222,00:46:08.223,You said baby.
00:46:08.307,00:46:09.808,Fine. I don't care. I don't care.
00:46:10.559,00:46:11.435,You love it.
00:46:12.561,00:46:15.939,"Goodbye, brah!"
00:46:16.148,00:46:18.859,How you like me now? Huh.
00:46:19.526,00:46:21.570,How you like me now?
00:46:24.656,00:46:27.451,How do you like me now!
00:46:42.007,00:46:43.217,Dance break!
00:46:56.522,00:46:58.899,"Yes, I'm sure I saw this."
00:46:58.982,00:47:01.151,All right. Let's keep this quiet.
00:47:01.235,00:47:02.361,"Yes, sir."
00:47:02.444,00:47:04.279,"Thank you for your loyalty, Pigeon Toady."
00:47:04.696,00:47:08.575,Or should I say boss.
00:47:18.669,00:47:20.754,"Cool, cool, cool."
00:47:23.590,00:47:27.052,Whoa. Steam room in an elevator. Mind blown.
00:47:27.135,00:47:28.220,Shut up. I'm planning.
00:47:28.303,00:47:29.471,"Oh, that's cool."
00:47:29.555,00:47:30.889,"All right. Now, listen."
00:47:30.973,00:47:32.266,"First, we have to stop that delivery."
00:47:32.641,00:47:34.768,But we don't know where they're headed.
00:47:35.018,00:47:37.437,Indeed. We won't go to them.
00:47:37.896,00:47:38.939,We'll make them...
00:47:42.568,00:47:44.027,"Well, I'm off."
00:47:44.111,00:47:45.904,You're in a suit suddenly.
00:47:45.988,00:47:47.155,Let's go.
00:47:51.493,00:47:53.120,My towel blew away.
00:47:55.747,00:47:56.707,Junior.
00:47:59.585,00:48:00.627,"I know, we gotta go, we gotta go."
00:48:04.965,00:48:06.883,You do it. You get the baby.
00:48:06.967,00:48:08.719,"Junior, I'm tired, too!"
00:48:09.553,00:48:11.597,"You made it, you get it."
00:50:24.938,00:50:25.939,I'm not fooling around.
00:50:48.628,00:50:50.380,We have to be absolutely silent.
00:50:50.464,00:50:53.467,One human sees a stork with a baby and we'll get reported.
00:51:08.440,00:51:10.275,-Why is she doing that? -I don't know.
00:51:12.527,00:51:13.361,Check.
00:51:13.445,00:51:14.446,Food?
00:51:15.155,00:51:15.989,Check.
00:51:16.072,00:51:17.073,Maybe she needs a nap.
00:51:18.784,00:51:20.702,Nope. What is it? What does she want?
00:51:27.501,00:51:28.627,I don't know. She's reaching for you.
00:51:28.710,00:51:29.753,Maybe she just wants you.
00:51:29.836,00:51:31.087,No. That doesn't make sense.
00:51:33.799,00:51:35.383,"Technically, she should be perfectly happy."
00:51:37.093,00:51:38.386,I have no idea.
00:51:44.100,00:51:46.019,"She's gonna blow, she's gonna blow."
00:51:46.102,00:51:47.103,What do I do with her?
00:51:47.187,00:51:48.939,"Take her, take her. Just take her."
00:52:06.498,00:52:08.291,Actually seems to be working pretty well.
00:52:13.547,00:52:16.633,Who's got the little sparkly eyes? You do.
00:52:17.342,00:52:18.510,You do.
00:52:24.808,00:52:26.768,"Oh, no! The boat's leaving!"
00:52:29.771,00:52:31.147,"No, no, no. Come on."
00:52:32.440,00:52:35.318,Wolf pack. Form of wolf minivan!
00:52:42.534,00:52:43.535,Give me a break.
00:52:48.748,00:52:50.709,This is not a safe way to transport the baby.
00:52:53.378,00:52:56.423,"-You're right, you're right, you're right. -Slower."
00:52:58.466,00:52:59.509,"Okay, good."
00:52:59.968,00:53:01.553,"Is that good, Tiny Thing?"
00:53:01.761,00:53:03.054,Hmm? Tiny Thing?
00:53:03.388,00:53:05.140,We lost her again!
00:53:05.974,00:53:08.184,"Quick, we can get to the boat through here."
00:53:09.477,00:53:10.854,Ah!
00:53:11.938,00:53:14.357,Wait. Why are you running so weird?
00:53:14.441,00:53:16.484,What don't I know?
00:53:17.193,00:53:18.862,My old nemesis.
00:53:19.195,00:53:20.405,Glass.
00:53:32.500,00:53:35.003,"Just go, Tulip. It's too late for me."
00:53:35.086,00:53:36.963,You've got the baby. You can deliver her yourself.
00:53:37.047,00:53:39.132,"What? No, I'm not leaving you behind!"
00:53:39.299,00:53:41.092,We can do this. Together.
00:53:48.224,00:53:50.018,Straight! Left! Right!
00:53:51.478,00:53:53.146,"Oh, no. I'm panicking!"
00:53:53.229,00:53:55.482,"Uh, right again. Left, I mean. Left."
00:53:55.565,00:53:56.691,"Right. Right, I mean."
00:53:59.235,00:54:00.904,"Left, left, left, right!"
00:54:00.987,00:54:02.322,"Rolft! I mean, ralft!"
00:54:07.035,00:54:08.620,This is not working!
00:54:10.372,00:54:12.499,Oh-oh! We did that together.
00:54:14.459,00:54:15.835,"Some, more than once."
00:54:17.128,00:54:18.296,"Oh, jeez."
00:54:19.881,00:54:21.174,Ah!
00:54:23.718,00:54:25.345,"I guess, pretty high in a glass factory."
00:54:31.768,00:54:36.147,"First, we're gonna take Tiny Thing, and raise her to be a strong, independent woman."
00:54:39.859,00:54:41.069,We made a great team.
00:54:44.280,00:54:46.616,That's my baby!
00:54:49.369,00:54:51.121,My baby.
00:54:54.749,00:54:56.751,"-No, no, no. -My baby, my baby!"
00:55:00.630,00:55:02.757,"Wolf pack, form of..."
00:55:08.596,00:55:09.431,Get away from us.
00:55:10.640,00:55:11.641,-Go home. -Come on.
00:55:11.725,00:55:12.559,Don't make me hit you.
00:55:12.642,00:55:15.395,"-Hey, hey, hey. Let me explain. -I don't wanna hear it."
00:55:15.478,00:55:16.938,"When you orphaned me, you said whoops!"
00:55:17.022,00:55:18.815,Whoops! You said whoops! Who does that?
00:55:18.898,00:55:20.567,Will you please let me explain?
00:55:20.650,00:55:23.486,"Hey. She doesn't wanna hear your explanation, guy."
00:55:23.570,00:55:24.404,Back off.
00:55:24.487,00:55:26.281,I fell in love with you.
00:55:27.824,00:55:28.658,"Okay, fine."
00:55:28.742,00:55:30.410,"Honestly, I am very curious. Let's hear it."
00:55:32.120,00:55:35.582,"Look, they tell you being a stork isn't gonna be easy."
00:55:36.041,00:55:37.167,Always deliver.
00:55:37.584,00:55:39.085,I failed to do that.
00:55:39.461,00:55:42.213,Your beacon broke. The pieces scattered.
00:55:42.547,00:55:48.762,I spent my entire life searching for the missing pieces so that I could deliver my baby.
00:55:49.179,00:55:53.016,"And yet, after all these years, I'm still missing one piece."
00:55:55.727,00:55:57.437,"...to be the parent I took from you, Tulip."
00:55:57.771,00:55:59.522,And I will lay down my life!
00:55:59.606,00:56:01.149,I have the missing piece.
00:56:02.734,00:56:03.902,"Excuse me, what?"
00:56:04.444,00:56:06.237,I have the missing piece.
00:56:15.330,00:56:16.664,My home.
00:56:17.207,00:56:18.500,I'm going home.
00:56:24.172,00:56:25.381,"Oh, my gosh."
00:56:25.465,00:56:27.509,"This is crazy! Junior, can you believe it?"
00:56:27.592,00:56:29.594,"No, that's so... That's so great."
00:56:29.677,00:56:31.221,"Yeah, yeah, you should go."
00:56:31.429,00:56:34.307,"Oh, yeah, well, after we deliver the baby. But, yeah!"
00:56:34.390,00:56:36.726,"No, no, no. I can take care of the baby."
00:56:36.810,00:56:37.977,You should go now.
00:56:38.394,00:56:40.063,"No, no, no. We have to finish the delivery."
00:56:40.146,00:56:40.980,I'm sorry to cut you off.
00:56:41.064,00:56:45.693,"You know what's so funny is just then when you said real family, it, like, weirdly hurt my feelings."
00:56:45.777,00:56:47.737,But I realized how stupid that is.
00:56:47.821,00:56:53.118,"I mean, I'm a bird, and you're, like, a sloppy human and that's not our baby. It's just some baby."
00:56:53.201,00:56:56.371,"Well, I mean, we're not, like, a family, but we are like a family."
00:56:56.454,00:57:02.001,"Well, it's like we are, except instead we're more like employees who are delivering a package, and that's all."
00:57:02.085,00:57:03.461,Do you know what I mean?
00:57:03.545,00:57:04.879,And you should go to where you belong.
00:57:04.963,00:57:06.005,Now. Do you know what I mean?
00:57:06.089,00:57:08.174,"No. Junior, we are a team, okay?"
00:57:08.258,00:57:13.138,"We're gonna deliver this baby, then we're gonna meet my parents, -then I'm gonna show them Stork Mountain. -I was supposed to fire you."
00:57:14.222,00:57:15.348,Okay?
00:57:15.723,00:57:17.767,You were supposed to fire me?
00:57:18.351,00:57:19.436,Yeah.
00:57:19.519,00:57:22.105,"Well, liberate. Free. Yes, fire."
00:57:22.564,00:57:23.940,"And then I didn't, and then this all happened."
00:57:24.023,00:57:26.401,"Look, there's nothing waiting for you back at Stork Mountain."
00:57:31.614,00:57:32.532,Who cares though?
00:57:32.615,00:57:34.242,It's time for you to go and meet your real family.
00:57:34.325,00:57:36.202,"That's exciting, right?"
00:57:38.663,00:57:40.957,"I just think this is for the best, you know?"
00:57:43.626,00:57:45.211,It's what you've always wanted.
00:57:45.587,00:57:46.796,"Yeah, I wanna go meet my family."
00:57:49.966,00:57:51.843,It's gonna be fine. I'll take good care of her.
00:57:56.723,00:57:58.099,"Goodbye, little girl."
00:57:58.349,00:58:00.101,Have a good trip back home.
00:58:00.643,00:58:03.313,You take care...
00:58:32.675,00:58:35.720,They're your family. They're going to love you.
00:58:40.350,00:58:41.976,I'll be right here.
00:58:42.060,00:58:43.645,"Oh, oh! Give me your camera."
00:58:43.728,00:58:45.939,I'd love to capture this family moment.
00:58:47.565,00:58:50.568,"Okay, camera rolling and action."
00:59:00.787,00:59:02.789,Yup. Okay.
00:59:04.832,00:59:06.292,Ring the doorbell.
00:59:08.419,00:59:10.046,I don't hear a doorbell ringing.
00:59:14.884,00:59:16.719,You're right. Let's take our time.
00:59:16.803,00:59:18.846,I've only waited my whole life for this!
00:59:21.558,00:59:22.392,Tulip?
00:59:48.001,00:59:48.960,-Okay. Big smile. -I'm a little nervous.
00:59:49.043,00:59:50.378,"Everyone, calm down!"
00:59:57.176,00:59:58.886,-What? -This all has to come down.
01:00:02.473,01:00:04.267,"-You're fired. -But, but, but..."
01:00:06.477,01:00:08.021,How were you not suspicious?
01:00:10.231,01:00:12.066,I thought it was a gentrifying neighborhood.
01:00:12.150,01:00:14.193,"Didn't expect to see you here, brah."
01:00:14.277,01:00:16.154,"Oh, yes, I did. I set it up."
01:00:16.446,01:00:17.572,Seize the thing.
01:00:24.579,01:00:26.623,Don't worry. She's gonna be fine.
01:00:26.706,01:00:28.082,She's with penguins.
01:00:28.166,01:00:30.418,They have whole documentaries about how great they are at babysitting.
01:00:33.921,01:00:35.423,And she'll be an excellent swimmer.
01:00:35.506,01:00:38.468,"And then when she's old enough, we'll return her to the human world."
01:00:38.551,01:00:40.386,That's insane. You need to deliver her.
01:00:40.470,01:00:44.098,We can't let it get out that the new boss accidentally made a baby!
01:00:44.182,01:00:46.142,"Our stock would plummet, everything we've built."
01:00:46.267,01:00:48.561,My entire company will fall apart!
01:00:48.645,01:00:50.396,Those parents can never find out.
01:00:50.480,01:00:52.106,"Okay, we're ready to go."
01:00:53.816,01:00:55.818,Who's the baby now?
01:00:57.278,01:00:58.446,Good enough.
01:01:06.579,01:01:08.247,-Cease and desist? -Why?
01:01:08.373,01:01:11.042,"This is not up to code, and quite frankly, it looks dangerous."
01:01:11.125,01:01:12.251,We can't tear it down.
01:01:12.335,01:01:14.379,'Cause then the storks won't deliver my baby brother.
01:01:24.931,01:01:26.599,"The policeman's right, Nate."
01:01:27.141,01:01:30.144,They don't deliver babies. Not anymore.
01:01:30.395,01:01:32.397,Then why did we do all this stuff?
01:01:32.480,01:01:36.109,Because we were having such fun playing with you.
01:01:36.192,01:01:39.070,"Oh, honey. We spent time together."
01:01:39.362,01:01:41.030,And that's what matters.
01:01:42.031,01:01:44.701,So is this like a ticket thing or a warning thing?
01:01:44.784,01:01:45.743,"It feels like a warning, right?"
01:02:28.911,01:02:29.954,Come on.
01:02:35.418,01:02:36.544,What?
01:02:42.759,01:02:44.093,"Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?"
01:02:44.177,01:02:45.344,What happened? Where's the baby?
01:02:45.428,01:02:46.512,They tied me up and took her.
01:02:46.596,01:02:47.889,Why would you think this was her house?
01:02:47.972,01:02:49.807,It's surrounded by a bunch of scary warehouses.
01:02:49.891,01:02:50.892,Gentrification!
01:02:50.975,01:02:52.852,How could they just take her? She was your responsibility.
01:02:54.270,01:02:56.189,I'm not blaming you. I'm just worried about the baby!
01:02:56.272,01:02:58.232,"Well, I'm also worried, which is why I'm yelling!"
01:02:58.316,01:02:59.692,We're yelling 'cause we're wasting time!
01:03:02.278,01:03:05.323,You're shopping? What are you doing?
01:03:09.160,01:03:11.746,"Oh, I see. You did that so we could hide in the box and get back to Cornerstore real quick."
01:03:11.829,01:03:13.164,-That's right. -Yeah.
01:03:13.456,01:03:15.500,"Wait a minute. Junior, what is going on?"
01:03:18.586,01:03:19.796,What the heck is this?
01:03:19.879,01:03:21.672,This is Storkcon.
01:03:21.756,01:03:25.134,"Once a year, storks come together for one thing."
01:03:25.218,01:03:26.302,Storkcon!
01:03:26.385,01:03:31.265,"The biggest stork convention on the planet Earth, where birds and-- -Uh, Junior? -What?"
01:03:31.349,01:03:33.100,What are you doing? We have to save the baby.
01:03:33.184,01:03:34.977,I'm just a huge fan of Storkcon.
01:03:35.269,01:03:36.270,'Cause it's so cool.
01:03:36.687,01:03:37.939,"There. Look, look, look!"
01:03:42.235,01:03:43.694,What? It calms me.
01:03:43.778,01:03:49.617,"Presenting the world's first round box, Sphericus!"
01:03:51.077,01:03:54.247,Circles can hold dreams!
01:03:56.165,01:03:57.625,How are we gonna get through this crowd?
01:03:59.919,01:04:01.796,I'm full of dreams!
01:04:02.713,01:04:05.299,"Hey, you guys aren't supposed to be back here."
01:04:11.848,01:04:13.766,"Even if we get the baby, we have no way to get out of here."
01:04:13.850,01:04:18.521,"Storkcon is huge, for storks come from all across the world-- Junior, stop talking about Storkcon!"
01:06:18.724,01:06:24.230,Growth analytics suggest increased bandwidth enabling us to silo creative core components.
01:06:24.313,01:06:25.481,I got your text.
01:06:25.564,01:06:27.233,"Sorry, but we could only find one jet pack."
01:06:28.526,01:06:30.236,"-What? No, I'm taking her. -No way."
01:06:30.319,01:06:31.487,"When you had her last, you lost her."
01:06:31.570,01:06:33.739,-After you left us. -After you fired me!
01:06:33.823,01:06:34.699,'Cause you're bad at everything.
01:06:34.782,01:06:37.535,"-I wish I'd never met you. -Whoa! Wow, well, you know what? I wish I'd never met you."
01:06:37.618,01:06:40.997,"The only good thing to come out of all of this is this baby, and I am taking her."
01:06:47.712,01:06:51.340,What is that?
01:07:12.194,01:07:13.612,"Oh, okay. Not that way."
01:07:14.989,01:07:15.990,"Hey, guys."
01:07:24.915,01:07:29.420,"Come one step closer, and I will drop this."
01:07:29.503,01:07:31.422,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
01:07:32.089,01:07:36.469,"Junior, look, hand over the baby, and we'll let bygones be bygones."
01:07:36.802,01:07:37.636,More than that.
01:07:37.720,01:07:39.263,You can still be...
01:07:39.346,01:07:41.807,Aaaahhh!
01:07:46.020,01:07:47.313,Why isn't it working?
01:07:47.396,01:07:49.440,Aaaahhh!
01:07:51.233,01:07:52.777,One baby?
01:07:53.569,01:07:55.196,How about a million!
01:08:01.077,01:08:03.662,I did not think that through.
01:08:08.000,01:08:09.376,No!
01:09:24.201,01:09:26.036,You stop it this instant.
01:09:44.889,01:09:46.807,Shut it down. Shut it down.
01:09:46.891,01:09:49.894,This is my moment!
01:09:56.650,01:09:57.943,Whoa!
01:09:58.444,01:09:59.820,Ooh!
01:10:01.071,01:10:02.907,"Oh, no!"
01:10:21.091,01:10:23.135,-Let's go -Come on.
01:10:23.219,01:10:25.221,"Go, go, go. Grab it."
01:10:39.526,01:10:41.278,Got it. Whoo.
01:10:41.946,01:10:43.739,"Out of my way, out of my way!"
01:10:51.705,01:10:54.833,One million babies!
01:11:01.215,01:11:02.216,"Oh, hi."
01:11:02.299,01:11:03.175,"-Oh, no. -No!"
01:11:06.720,01:11:09.181,Now it's time to do what I should've done so long ago.
01:11:09.265,01:11:11.517,Destroy the baby factory!
01:11:11.934,01:11:12.893,"No, you can't."
01:11:14.144,01:11:15.813,"-Yes, I can. -No, you can't."
01:11:16.355,01:11:20.484,We could go on like this all day. I'm just gonna go on and destroy the baby factory.
01:11:20.567,01:11:23.195,"Goodbye, baby-making machine."
01:11:27.533,01:11:28.617,What the heck?
01:11:29.702,01:11:31.203,Told you babies were smart.
01:11:33.622,01:11:36.041,Babies are dumb. Babies are super-duper dumb.
01:11:38.294,01:11:40.212,"-Diamond, give it back. -You stop it, this instant! Stop! Stop!"
01:11:44.800,01:11:47.511,No!
01:12:16.665,01:12:17.958,Whoa!
01:12:23.922,01:12:26.091,Now get over here and get me out of here.
01:12:27.384,01:12:28.385,Oh!
01:12:41.065,01:12:42.232,What?
01:12:46.236,01:12:47.112,"Oh, no."
01:13:00.751,01:13:01.585,No!
01:13:52.428,01:13:53.429,Whoo. You did it.
01:13:53.512,01:13:54.888,I can hear my bones.
01:14:00.060,01:14:02.563,We did it. We did it. We're a family!
01:14:02.646,01:14:04.273,Yes! We're a...
01:14:08.861,01:14:10.696,"Sorry, I kinda ruined the moment there."
01:14:10.779,01:14:12.573,I just have so much internal bleeding.
01:14:13.115,01:14:14.575,We're a family.
01:14:16.118,01:14:18.537,"Uh, what? What? I thought it was broken."
01:14:18.620,01:14:19.997,I guess it was just dislocated.
01:14:20.080,01:14:21.540,It must've popped back in when we landed.
01:14:21.623,01:14:24.209,"Oh, yep. What a twist."
01:14:39.600,01:14:40.976,"-Oh, no. -Uh..."
01:14:41.059,01:14:43.395,So many of them.
01:14:43.479,01:14:44.855,They're pulling my feathers!
01:14:44.938,01:14:46.773,What are we going to do?
01:14:46.857,01:14:48.859,"All right, everybody. Gather around. Gather around."
01:14:49.401,01:14:53.113,An annoying person asked me once why I wanna be boss.
01:14:53.530,01:14:55.657,"Well, I never knew why until today."
01:14:56.325,01:14:58.744,Baby delivery is our true calling.
01:14:59.077,01:15:04.625,"This is not just a bunch of metal, and glass, and whatever that giant magical crystal-looking thing is made of."
01:15:05.042,01:15:08.545,This is the heart of what storks were put on this Earth to do.
01:15:08.629,01:15:09.963,This is our mission.
01:15:10.047,01:15:11.840,We pride ourselves on customer service.
01:15:11.924,01:15:15.177,"Well, this is a family that never got the baby they asked for."
01:15:15.469,01:15:16.637,Make a plan.
01:15:16.887,01:15:18.430,Stick to the plan.
01:15:18.514,01:15:19.598,Always deliver.
01:15:23.018,01:15:25.604,That's great. This is great. But we don't have any pods.
01:15:27.564,01:15:29.608,"Wait! Everyone, stop. Would you stop?"
01:15:31.401,01:15:33.820,-What about these? -Yes.
01:15:33.904,01:15:35.072,"Thank you, Jasper."
01:15:35.155,01:15:36.156,I agree.
01:15:36.240,01:15:39.076,Baby delivery is what we're born to do.
01:15:42.079,01:15:43.830,Should we do anything about him?
01:15:43.914,01:15:46.041,It's... It's fine.
01:17:44.284,01:17:46.286,"They're here. Oh, my gosh."
01:17:46.370,01:17:47.746,I can't believe it. They're here.
01:17:47.829,01:17:49.039,They're here!
01:18:12.688,01:18:13.980,Sign here.
01:18:14.106,01:18:15.148,And sign here.
01:18:40.757,01:18:42.509,"I love you, my little lady."
01:18:44.177,01:18:46.012,And we always will.
01:18:47.013,01:18:48.098,Bye.
01:18:49.224,01:18:51.727,"Oh, so you deliver to the front door."
01:18:51.810,01:18:54.229,So we didn't have to destroy our entire house.
01:18:54.312,01:18:55.147,Yeah.
01:18:55.230,01:18:57.274,"Yo, Stork! I ordered a brother."
01:18:57.524,01:18:58.900,I ordered a brother!
01:18:59.025,01:19:00.986,You wanna feed her her bottle?
01:19:06.658,01:19:08.243,Ninja skills.
01:19:15.876,01:19:17.043,You okay?
01:19:19.796,01:19:21.882,"Oh, this does not feel good."
01:19:22.257,01:19:24.092,Is every delivery gonna be like this?
01:19:24.176,01:19:26.720,What can I say? It's a terrible business.
01:19:29.806,01:19:31.475,No. I'm actually fine now.
01:19:31.558,01:19:33.435,"Yeah, it looks like you're handling stuff real well."
01:19:36.521,01:19:38.023,"Yeah, pretty cool, man."
01:19:38.273,01:19:40.108,Just enjoying it.
01:19:40.233,01:19:42.861,"You know, I'm here if you wanna talk about anything."
01:19:42.944,01:19:44.237,-I'm here to listen. -Nope.
01:20:10.430,01:20:12.307,We're all right behind you.
01:20:34.538,01:20:35.872,"Who is it, Dad?"
01:20:42.045,01:20:43.213,Mom and Dad?
01:20:53.723,01:20:55.100,"All right, guys."
01:20:55.433,01:20:56.977,We delivered her.
01:20:57.060,01:20:58.061,Let's go.
01:21:00.272,01:21:02.107,Where are you going? Get over here.
01:21:10.448,01:21:11.366,You love it.
