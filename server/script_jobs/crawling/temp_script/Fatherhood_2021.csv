00:01:26.753,00:01:27.754,This sucks.
00:01:39.682,00:01:41.643,"You haven't seen Matt, have you?"
00:01:41.726,00:01:43.186,"Yeah, I saw him go upstairs."
00:01:58.785,00:01:59.953,Don't dress me.
00:02:00.662,00:02:02.455,You're gonna be okay.
00:02:02.539,00:02:08.002,The both of you are gonna get through this because the Lord has a plan for you.
00:02:08.086,00:02:15.176,"-I know, Mom. But don't put on my shoe. -You're just gonna pick yourself up and be this wonderful, special guy you've always been."
00:02:15.260,00:02:17.804,"Yeah, I don't need you to tie my shoe."
00:02:18.513,00:02:19.973,"Don't tie it, Mom."
00:02:35.405,00:02:36.614,We have to do this soon.
00:02:38.783,00:02:41.077,-The baby's not due for another two weeks. -Yeah.
00:02:42.620,00:02:45.999,and your daughter's already a healthy size. So let's get her out.
00:02:46.875,00:02:49.169,-It's a girl. -I heard her. I heard what she said.
00:02:51.337,00:02:57.302,"You would've knew that if you were our regular doctor, who chose this week of all weeks to go to Maui, which is insane."
00:02:59.095,00:03:01.014,"You know, it's just our first kid."
00:03:01.097,00:03:04.142,"Also, she's still breech, so I wanna schedule a cesarean for this evening."
00:03:06.144,00:03:09.689,"Well, I haven't even set up the crib. I didn't-- Are you serious?"
00:03:09.772,00:03:13.234,"See, I knew I should've taken care of it. You told me to take it off my list."
00:03:13.318,00:03:16.613,'Cause I wanted you to take it off your list. I'm handling it. I got it.
00:03:16.696,00:03:18.239,That's really reassuring.
00:03:21.075,00:03:23.786,Yes! No-- Who's really ready?
00:03:23.870,00:03:27.540,"Like, what does that mean when you say, Are you really ready for this?"
00:03:27.624,00:03:29.792,This evening? Can we do it tomorrow?
00:03:30.501,00:03:34.214,"'Cause I got a fantasy football draft. Um, me and some guys from work."
00:03:34.297,00:03:38.426,"We put a nice little pool together, and we-- I'm kiddin'. Why are you taking me serious?"
00:03:44.432,00:03:45.892,"Yeah, my hands started sweatin'."
00:03:45.975,00:03:47.101,-I know. -Yeah.
00:03:52.106,00:03:54.400,Why couldn't you guys give us adequate warning?
00:03:54.484,00:03:56.486,"Well, we just thought it'd be fun to surprise you."
00:03:56.569,00:03:59.656,"We said, You know, we should have this baby tonight and mess with Marion."
00:03:59.739,00:04:02.659,"-Love your sense of humor, Matt. -Yeah, well, at least I got one. Bye-bye."
00:04:02.742,00:04:06.079,"Oh, okay. Mom, we'll call you as soon as it's over, okay? I love you."
00:04:08.873,00:04:11.459,"-What? Mom! -Okay, now we're just being weird."
00:04:11.542,00:04:16.881,I want to be in the room with my daughter and to see my granddaughter when she enters the world.
00:04:16.965,00:04:18.591,"Well, I'll be here to take care of her."
00:04:18.675,00:04:20.551,Like you took care of Cousin Janey's baby?
00:04:20.635,00:04:22.345,"Mom, that is ancient history."
00:04:24.514,00:04:32.981,You don't put a baby on your lap and then strap a seat belt over you in the passenger seat in an automobile driving to 7-Eleven.
00:04:33.064,00:04:38.403,I know you don't hold a baby in your lap and strap a seat belt over you while you in the passenger seat of an automobile driving to 7-Eleven.
00:04:38.486,00:04:39.362,I know that!
00:04:39.445,00:04:41.281,Terrific. Skype me.
00:04:42.073,00:04:44.367,"Sweetie pie, Mommy will see you tomorrow."
00:04:52.417,00:04:53.293,Two kisses.
00:04:53.793,00:04:55.211,-Wake up. -Oh my God.
00:04:55.295,00:04:56.796,I'm ready. I'm ready to dance.
00:05:07.015,00:05:07.849,What's goin' on?
00:05:08.391,00:05:10.977,"Oh hey, stay away from that tuna casserole."
00:05:11.060,00:05:13.646,The one in the middle tastes like ass.
00:05:18.526,00:05:23.239,"It's really good. It's really… It's got, like, a tang."
00:05:23.323,00:05:31.331,"-It's all right, man. It's okay. -Like a tangy-- Matt."
00:05:31.414,00:05:32.957,"-Jordan, I don't-- -Come here."
00:05:33.041,00:05:35.209,"Nope, come here. Bring it in. You need this."
00:05:36.836,00:05:37.670,Bring it in.
00:05:38.880,00:05:40.923,"Let it out. Breathe, breathe."
00:05:44.010,00:05:47.722,Let me tell you something. That speech-- Your speech.
00:05:47.805,00:05:51.184,"You went up there, and you talked."
00:05:55.355,00:06:01.944,"I don't, um… I don't know what to say."
00:06:03.529,00:06:08.034,"I… I would've assumed you'd have written something, but you said, No, I'm freestyling this."
00:06:08.117,00:06:11.287,"Okay, we done? 'Cause I can't do this right now."
00:06:11.371,00:06:14.082,"-Please. -No. Nope, Matt. Look at me."
00:06:14.165,00:06:16.793,"-You can, and let me tell you why. -You're not listening to me."
00:06:16.876,00:06:19.212,Remember Camp Winapoo? You remember we went to Camp Winapoo?
00:06:19.295,00:06:21.631,-I do. -And you got the poison ivy in your face.
00:06:21.714,00:06:27.303,"Your face started blistering. It was… it was bubbling, and the bumps… Then the bumps was poppin', so you had pus comin' out of your face."
00:06:27.387,00:06:28.971,"And you looked crazy as hell, right?"
00:06:29.055,00:06:31.015,"You came to lunch, and your crush was there, Marcy."
00:06:31.099,00:06:32.433,You used to love Marcy.
00:06:32.517,00:06:35.311,"And when she saw him, she screamed."
00:06:36.354,00:06:38.356,-And you was devastated. -Yeah.
00:06:39.023,00:06:40.483,-But you got through that. -Yeah.
00:06:40.566,00:06:41.401,You got through that?
00:06:41.484,00:06:44.195,Because you're strong and confident.
00:06:44.278,00:06:45.947,And you'll get through this too.
00:06:49.117,00:06:51.035,This is so much worse than that.
00:06:52.120,00:06:53.663,How is that the same?
00:06:56.082,00:06:58.876,I'mma punch you in the face. Don't say nothin' else to me.
00:06:58.960,00:07:00.378,-Wow-- -I told you I can't.
00:07:01.712,00:07:02.713,"Jordan, I swear to God."
00:07:02.797,00:07:04.924,-Why you ballin' up your fists? -Swear to God. Stop.
00:07:14.934,00:07:16.978,"-It's gonna be okay, all right? -Okay."
00:07:17.061,00:07:18.312,I love you so much.
00:07:25.319,00:07:26.154,"Yes, Marion?"
00:07:26.237,00:07:27.822,I can't see. Come on!
00:07:30.616,00:07:33.369,"It's happening. I wanna look, but I don't wanna look."
00:07:33.453,00:07:36.497,"But I do wanna look, but I don't want to look."
00:07:45.465,00:07:47.258,"Okay? How we doin', doc?"
00:07:54.891,00:07:56.184,We got a baby.
00:08:51.906,00:08:56.536,"Um… I just wanted to, uh… -Matt. -Mmm."
00:08:56.619,00:08:58.621,"Oh, you didn't have to."
00:08:58.704,00:09:01.123,"I know I didn't have to. I wanted to, 'cause you deserve it."
00:09:01.207,00:09:03.000,It's beautiful. Thank you.
00:09:05.753,00:09:08.047,-Mmm! -You're still gonna have to do diapers.
00:09:08.130,00:09:11.092,"As long as they promise to change my diapers when I get old, I'm happy."
00:09:12.510,00:09:14.637,-Love you. Thank you. -Love you. How you feelin'?
00:09:14.720,00:09:18.599,"A little sore but-- -How are you doing, Liz? -I wanna see Maddy."
00:09:18.683,00:09:19.559,Hey.
00:09:22.603,00:09:24.814,"Matt, I'm gonna need you to come around here and help me."
00:09:24.897,00:09:27.108,-Gladly. -She's gonna be a bit wobbly.
00:09:31.112,00:09:34.574,"-Let's get you to the chair. Easy, easy. -Ready for a 10K."
00:09:35.616,00:09:37.535,"-All right. -Guys, I feel light-headed."
00:09:37.618,00:09:46.294,"Take your time, honey. Take your-- -Was she dizzy earlier? -What's wrong? Liz? I don't know!"
00:09:46.377,00:09:48.004,-Liz? -She's having trouble breathing.
00:09:49.922,00:09:51.257,-Look at me! -Medical emergency!
00:09:51.340,00:09:52.800,Liz! Liz! Look at me!
00:09:52.883,00:09:54.510,-Give her space. -What's wrong with her?
00:09:57.430,00:09:59.223,-I need you to step back now! -Wait a minute.
00:10:00.975,00:10:03.060,-There were no precursory signs. -What's goin' on? Liz!
00:10:18.826,00:10:22.121,"Hey. What's up, doc? What's… what's goin' on, man?"
00:10:25.166,00:10:27.418,"Uh, a blood clot traveled to her lung."
00:10:27.501,00:10:28.502,What does that mean?
00:10:29.837,00:10:56.572,What's that mea-- What is it? Is it Maddy? What? Jus-- Matt!
00:11:26.686,00:11:27.520,How?
00:12:05.391,00:12:06.809,Here she is.
00:12:40.342,00:12:42.219,He hasn't even put the crib together.
00:12:42.887,00:12:45.931,"Well, you know, he's always been extremely immature."
00:12:46.599,00:12:49.101,"Oh, hi, Matt. How are you, dear?"
00:12:49.185,00:12:50.519,I'm extremely immature.
00:12:53.355,00:12:56.025,"-Can you give the baby, please? -I just gave her a bottle."
00:12:56.108,00:12:56.942,Okay.
00:13:05.242,00:13:11.457,"You know, Maddy, if you could have only one parent, I wish you could've had your mom."
00:13:16.420,00:13:18.339,'Cause she would've been better at it.
00:13:22.968,00:13:24.637,I think sooner than later.
00:13:32.394,00:13:33.562,"Mmm, mmm, mmm."
00:13:34.355,00:13:35.189,"Mmm, mmm, hmm?"
00:13:35.898,00:13:37.650,I don't know how he gonna do this.
00:13:44.323,00:13:45.199,Nah.
00:13:55.584,00:13:57.461,"All right! All right, Maddy!"
00:13:57.545,00:14:00.840,"Okay. You win. You win, Maddy."
00:14:05.427,00:14:07.179,You want your diaper changed again?
00:14:13.394,00:14:15.020,Okay. Wait a second.
00:14:16.605,00:14:17.690,"Hold on, Maddy."
00:14:18.315,00:14:20.234,Okay. Here.
00:14:22.903,00:14:26.115,"All right, all right. Huh? Wait, I didn't get it all."
00:14:26.824,00:14:29.743,Oh my G-- Shit!
00:14:42.089,00:14:44.091,What is that on that baby's bottom?
00:14:45.676,00:14:46.552,It's a diaper.
00:14:46.635,00:14:48.387,It looks like a balloon animal.
00:14:48.470,00:14:50.973,-Is it inside out? -The diaper's on fine.
00:14:51.056,00:14:53.058,I just came down to give her a bottle.
00:14:54.476,00:14:57.062,Already done. We heard her crying.
00:15:06.947,00:15:10.367,"Matthew, darling, we've been talking-- We think you should move back to Minnesota."
00:15:17.750,00:15:20.544,"We'll all be together. You'll have a church, a support system."
00:15:20.628,00:15:23.797,"-You're all alone here. -I'm not alone, okay? My job is here."
00:15:24.757,00:15:28.594,There are no good tech jobs at home. My friends are here.
00:15:28.677,00:15:30.262,Your friends are kind of weird.
00:15:30.346,00:15:33.307,"Okay. That may be true, but they're my friends, Ma."
00:15:33.390,00:15:34.850,Liz is here.
00:15:35.643,00:15:40.522,"And every place that I look here, every single place that I look makes me think of her."
00:15:41.315,00:15:43.233,"Mom, you always talk to me about God's plan."
00:15:43.317,00:15:48.113,I would love to know what the odds are of me meetin' somebody from my hometown halfway across the country.
00:15:49.365,00:15:50.866,I had a plan.
00:15:51.492,00:15:54.787,Liz was to go away to grad school and then come back and work and live.
00:15:54.870,00:15:57.289,That was the plan before she met you.
00:15:57.373,00:16:02.044,"Now, you want to stay, do that, but Maddy comes with us."
00:16:05.005,00:16:08.467,"Believe it or not, it's best for you too. I care about you."
00:16:09.969,00:16:11.971,"You think you can do this, but you can't."
00:16:12.054,00:16:15.933,"Raisin' a child, that's a… that's a nonstop, all-day, all-night affair."
00:16:18.936,00:16:22.898,"I understand, and I'll… I'll think about it."
00:16:24.233,00:16:25.359,Okay.
00:16:35.119,00:16:37.746,"Yeah, I just… I just thought about it. You're right."
00:16:38.288,00:16:42.209,"No, Marion, you're right. I can't. I… I can't do it. But you know what?"
00:16:43.168,00:16:44.169,I'm gonna do it.
00:16:44.920,00:16:47.423,"Yeah, I'm… I'mma do it. I'm gonna bring Maddy up."
00:16:47.923,00:16:51.427,I'm… I'mma bring Maddy up because I'm her father.
00:16:53.887,00:16:56.682,"Do you know that I love her, Marion, because I doubt that you really do."
00:16:56.765,00:16:59.059,I have no doubt you love that baby.
00:16:59.143,00:17:01.729,I have no doubt you loved my Liz.
00:17:02.980,00:17:06.233,But you wanna keep Maddy to yourself because you need a life raft.
00:17:07.776,00:17:09.403,I'm sorry I messed up your plan.
00:17:17.161,00:17:20.039,You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
00:17:20.122,00:17:22.166,You catch even more with a flyswatter.
00:17:22.249,00:17:23.250,Marion!
00:17:24.126,00:17:34.386,If there's one piece of advice that I could give you about bringing up a kid… Let go.
00:17:35.429,00:17:38.640,"Look, as a parent, we do all this shit, right?"
00:17:38.724,00:17:41.643,Trying to make everything perfect.
00:17:45.606,00:17:47.399,You just have to accept that fact.
00:17:51.195,00:17:52.321,Liz loved you.
00:17:53.572,00:17:55.908,And it made me happy to see that.
00:17:57.159,00:17:59.703,And I also saw how much you loved her.
00:18:05.000,00:18:06.001,Yeah.
00:18:07.086,00:18:12.132,"You are a, um… You're a good father."
00:18:14.927,00:18:16.845,"She was lucky to have you, Mike."
00:18:18.639,00:18:19.640,Thanks.
00:18:23.477,00:18:24.311,Hmm.
00:18:46.083,00:18:48.335,I had an aunt who died this past year.
00:18:48.418,00:18:49.253,She was 99.
00:18:50.170,00:18:53.132,"Wow. That, uh… that must've been a shock."
00:18:53.215,00:18:54.049,It was.
00:18:54.967,00:18:59.138,"Listen, I want you to take as much time… Okay."
00:18:59.221,00:19:00.097,…as you need.
00:19:00.180,00:19:01.932,"-Thank you. -Five weeks, six weeks."
00:19:02.015,00:19:03.392,I don-- Whatever.
00:19:03.475,00:19:07.646,"I'll probably need about ten, twenty years."
00:19:07.729,00:19:10.357,"-Well, yeah… -That would do it, but I… I need my job."
00:19:11.275,00:19:14.361,"You know? That's why I can't, uh… I can't have that time."
00:19:14.444,00:19:20.868,"Listen, Howard, I was thinking maybe I could just work from home and… and come in as you need me. You know?"
00:19:20.951,00:19:23.287,"And when I come in, I'd have to bring my daughter with me."
00:19:23.370,00:19:25.873,-You're taking care of her? -That's correct.
00:19:29.501,00:19:31.211,You don't think I can do it.
00:19:31.295,00:19:37.301,"It's not that I don't think you can do it… See, what is it that a woman has that a man doesn't?"
00:19:37.384,00:19:40.888,Patience. Emotional vulnerability.
00:19:41.388,00:19:43.515,Uh… Breasts.
00:19:43.599,00:19:44.725,Some men have breasts.
00:19:45.976,00:19:47.769,I'm gonna let that go 'cause you're grieving.
00:19:47.853,00:19:49.938,"Listen, I love babies."
00:19:50.022,00:19:52.274,"You know, I have three of them myself."
00:19:52.357,00:19:55.944,"They're not babies anymore in the picture, but when they started, they were babies."
00:19:56.028,00:19:58.197,"And I'm tellin' ya, it's brutal."
00:19:58.280,00:20:00.240,It'll wipe you out.
00:20:00.324,00:20:01.617,She have solid poops yet?
00:20:01.700,00:20:02.743,No. Nope.
00:20:02.826,00:20:05.412,"I'm, uh… I'm dealing with the creamy shit right now."
00:20:05.495,00:20:07.789,Enjoy the creamy shit. It's a big jump.
00:20:07.873,00:20:10.417,"When you get to solid poops, it's not a picnic."
00:20:11.001,00:20:11.835,Okay.
00:20:11.919,00:20:17.299,"Save that. Put it in the… with your roses and your flowers 'cause it's packed with nutrients, that stuff."
00:20:18.175,00:20:20.719,-That's-- It's… it's a great tip. -Yeah.
00:20:20.802,00:20:22.804,"The London account, I know it's comin' up in five weeks."
00:20:22.888,00:20:25.265,"I just wanna tell you, I'm on it."
00:20:25.349,00:20:29.478,"You know, I'm more than capable of doin' the job that needs to be done."
00:20:29.561,00:20:33.398,"You know, but if you feel like I'm… I'm not or I can't be, maybe you could put Oscar on it."
00:20:33.482,00:20:35.192,-Jesus Christ. Oscar? -And see-- Yeah.
00:20:35.275,00:20:38.362,"No, no, no, no. Nah, no, no. Forget Oscar."
00:20:38.445,00:20:42.199,"-Did you ask him? -Um… Did you ask him, Do you want Oscar to handle the clients?"
00:20:42.282,00:20:43.951,-Yeah. I did. -Remember? Like we rehearsed?
00:20:44.034,00:20:45.869,"I said it, Oscar. It worked."
00:20:45.953,00:20:55.754,-I told you it would. That's great news. -Yeah. Yeah. D-- It's kind of cruel to send flowers to someone who's grieving.
00:20:56.338,00:21:00.634,"'Cause, you know, flowers die, and then you gotta throw them out."
00:21:01.260,00:21:02.719,It's just such a bummer.
00:21:03.387,00:21:07.432,"You know, I've never seen, like, a… like, a person pass or anything."
00:21:07.516,00:21:09.935,"But, um, you know, I've seen a squirrel pass."
00:21:10.018,00:21:11.770,It makes you wonder about the circle of life.
00:21:11.853,00:21:13.855,But it's not really a circle. It's like a line.
00:21:13.939,00:21:16.608,"-'Cause there's a beginning and an end. -Hey, Oscar."
00:21:18.527,00:21:19.903,Can you stop talking?
00:21:20.570,00:21:22.281,"Man, you sound just like my wife."
00:21:27.369,00:21:29.162,"You're gonna swaddle Maddy, aren't you?"
00:21:29.246,00:21:30.789,Did you swaddle Liz?
00:21:30.872,00:21:31.832,I sure did.
00:21:31.915,00:21:34.918,"Then, yeah, I mean, I'mma do whatever Liz would've wanted me to do."
00:21:35.752,00:21:38.630,But this… this looks insane.
00:21:38.714,00:21:41.300,"I mean, that's… that's tight there, Marion."
00:21:41.383,00:21:43.385,"What, do you think she's gonna run away or somethin'?"
00:21:45.846,00:21:47.055,How you doin'?
00:21:47.764,00:21:49.057,These are Flamin' Hots.
00:21:49.141,00:21:52.394,Anybody want some? Grandmas? Want me to give one to the baby? Mmm.
00:21:52.936,00:21:54.980,"Y'all lookin' good, ladies. Can I say that to you?"
00:21:56.523,00:21:58.066,-No problem. You know-- -Stop it.
00:22:02.362,00:22:03.196,What am I doin'?
00:22:03.280,00:22:05.240,-You're flirtin' with my mother. -I'm not flirtin'.
00:22:05.324,00:22:06.825,I'm looking at you flirt with my mama.
00:22:06.908,00:22:10.912,"I'm flirtin' with both your mamas. Hey, Marion, how you doin'? Looking good."
00:22:10.996,00:22:12.956,"-Jordan. -Kind of a blouse-sweater, huh?"
00:22:20.088,00:22:22.674,"Look, man, I got a… a present for you. Can I give you a present?"
00:22:22.758,00:22:25.260,Wait right here. I'll be right back. I got somethin' for you.
00:22:25.344,00:22:27.596,We've been makin' a list. We need onesies.
00:22:27.679,00:22:31.600,"And you need a lock. A toilet lock. You know, they can drown in the toilet."
00:22:31.683,00:22:36.229,"Look, I've been meaning to ask, wh-- How long… how long are you stayin'?"
00:22:39.107,00:22:43.236,"We've discussed that. But, Marion, I wasn't a hundred percent sure about you."
00:22:43.320,00:22:47.949,"Well, since you refuse to move back to Minnesota, I'll stay six months."
00:22:50.243,00:22:51.244,Six months?
00:22:51.328,00:22:53.663,-Yes. -What about Mike?
00:22:58.251,00:23:01.338,"Hey, uh, Mike. How you doin', man?"
00:23:04.549,00:23:06.218,I want us to be honest for a second.
00:23:06.301,00:23:07.928,"Okay, let's be honest."
00:23:09.763,00:23:12.265,The first thing I want to say is that I love havin' you here.
00:23:12.349,00:23:13.308,I know you do.
00:23:14.976,00:23:24.444,"But what worries me is that if you're here… you know, if you're… if you're here for an extended period of time, we're gonna end up gettin' on each other's nerves."
00:23:24.528,00:23:25.612,In just six months?
00:23:25.695,00:23:28.782,That's why I was thinking maybe you could leave when my mom leaves.
00:23:28.865,00:23:34.996,What would I look like goin' home before I know that you are capable of taking care of my newborn grandchild?
00:23:35.080,00:23:37.707,How are you ever gonna know if you don't let me do it?
00:23:43.672,00:23:46.758,"Forty-love, Matt. Here you go, brother. Look what I got for you, huh?"
00:23:46.842,00:23:47.801,"What is that, Jordan?"
00:23:47.884,00:23:49.553,-I got you a pet. -That's a goldfish.
00:23:49.636,00:23:53.557,"And let me tell you somethin', kids with pets are really happy."
00:23:53.640,00:23:56.059,"Also, they don't get any allergies. Did you know that?"
00:23:56.560,00:23:57.978,That's cats and dogs.
00:24:00.188,00:24:07.112,"-Damn it, you read the same article. -Okay. Jordan, this is… this is-- I'm sorry. Excuse my French."
00:24:07.195,00:24:09.489,I hate this fish. You remember Tanya? She gave me this fish.
00:24:09.573,00:24:13.326,Tanya broke up with me and left this dirty-ass fish in my house.
00:24:13.410,00:24:14.995,Can you take me to the baby store?
00:24:16.663,00:24:17.539,-Hell yeah! -Thank you.
00:24:17.622,00:24:20.417,Team Single Father! I'm here to help you at the end of the day.
00:24:20.500,00:24:23.962,"Thank you. Okay, Marion. How about we do this?"
00:24:24.045,00:24:30.051,"How about… how about, when you go back, right, I promise to give you updates, let you know how Maddy's doin'?"
00:24:30.135,00:24:32.846,"Uh, I'll post pictures on my Instagram all the time."
00:24:32.929,00:24:33.847,All right.
00:24:33.930,00:24:36.725,I will go home when Anna goes.
00:24:36.808,00:24:43.690,"But if you are not handling everything all very well, you move your butt back to Minnesota."
00:24:43.773,00:24:47.235,-Why would I agree to that? -Because it's not about you.
00:24:58.830,00:25:08.590,"-These are great. -Oh, well… I don't have no kids. This is for my friend."
00:25:08.673,00:25:11.510,"This for his baby. You know, man, he's buyin' all this stuff."
00:25:16.097,00:25:19.935,"This is, uh… this is your diaper rash ointment for you."
00:25:20.018,00:25:23.104,This one's Maddy's. Just do… do his separate.
00:25:23.188,00:25:29.611,Here. Just put yours over there so she knows that you have to pay for the stuff that you got for your problem by yourself.
00:25:29.694,00:25:31.571,And this one's the one I'm paying for for Maddy.
00:25:31.655,00:25:33.865,-That's yours. This is Maddy's. -Okay.
00:25:33.949,00:25:39.079,He says situa-- I mean… -Bumps. -Bumps. But it's… it's shavin' bumps.
00:25:40.830,00:25:52.676,-I have shavin' bumps from shavin' and-- -On your… And I saw a video that people use diaper rash ointment to keep their skin clear from gaining shavin' bumps. That's why I got such a smooth neck.
00:25:52.759,00:25:55.011,-Look how-- -You look great… -I look great? -Yeah.
00:25:55.095,00:25:56.972,"See, look at that. Yeah, she said I look great."
00:25:57.055,00:25:58.265,Ask to see his butt.
00:25:59.432,00:26:03.812,Now insert the eighth 44-millimeter screw.
00:26:06.898,00:26:10.986,I don't see it. I don't see the eighth 4… 44-millimeter screw.
00:26:11.069,00:26:11.945,I don't see it.
00:26:12.028,00:26:16.116,You're not even looking for real. Look… look next to your shoe. Look.
00:26:17.826,00:26:18.660,Okay.
00:26:18.743,00:26:21.204,"Why do you keep acting like you dumb, huh?"
00:26:21.288,00:26:23.206,"Because I didn't see it, I'm acting like I'm dumb?"
00:26:23.290,00:26:25.250,You acting like a dumb mother-fudger right now.
00:26:25.333,00:26:28.378,-Don't cuss at me in front of my child. -I didn't. I called you a mother-fudger.
00:26:28.461,00:26:29.588,Why are you sayin' fudge?
00:26:29.671,00:26:31.881,There's a baby. I don't wanna curse in front of the baby.
00:26:31.965,00:26:33.633,So why not just choose another word?
00:26:33.717,00:26:34.718,I did. Fudge.
00:26:35.552,00:26:38.096,"Man. You know, your daddy is a witch."
00:26:38.179,00:26:41.016,"Yeah, I said it. He's a dumbass witch."
00:26:42.851,00:26:44.394,Goofy mother-fudger.
00:26:48.857,00:26:53.570,"See, it's not… Just reach under and flip the switch."
00:26:53.653,00:26:55.447,I did reach under. It's broken.
00:26:55.530,00:26:57.073,You've always been so impatient.
00:26:57.157,00:26:59.367,Stop. This ain't got nothin' to do with patience!
00:26:59.451,00:27:02.078,"I'm telling you I'm trying to do it, and you just-- I can't!"
00:27:02.162,00:27:03.622,"I can't, Mom!"
00:27:04.372,00:27:05.206,Shit.
00:27:06.374,00:27:07.709,I can't do none of it.
00:27:09.502,00:27:10.503,I can't do it.
00:27:11.880,00:27:13.006,Not without Liz.
00:27:13.923,00:27:17.260,You just have to do what's best for her.
00:27:17.344,00:27:20.096,That's all you have to do the rest of your life.
00:27:20.764,00:27:22.557,And I believe you can do that.
00:27:33.276,00:27:34.110,Right here.
00:27:35.362,00:27:36.196,Show-off.
00:27:40.742,00:27:43.203,"Listen, if it's nine, don't kill yourself, okay?"
00:27:44.871,00:27:47.082,"-That's real lucky. -Goodbye, Nana."
00:27:47.916,00:27:49.542,"-Come, come, come. -You got her?"
00:27:50.377,00:27:51.378,We have a deal now.
00:27:53.004,00:27:56.841,"If it's in her best interest, you're moving back. Okay?"
00:27:56.925,00:27:57.967,No being selfish.
00:27:58.551,00:27:59.427,Agreed.
00:28:21.032,00:28:22.575,Oh. Hey.
00:28:30.834,00:28:32.544,Mmm. Mmm.
00:28:34.587,00:28:37.048,-Daddy in a sling. Look at that. -How do I look?
00:28:37.132,00:28:38.550,You look great. Like a king.
00:28:38.633,00:28:41.636,"-Don't say it just to be sayin' it, man. -You look like a king."
00:28:43.888,00:28:45.765,-I'm pushin' down. -I'm pushing my side down.
00:28:48.268,00:28:52.188,"Fellas! Fellas! Okay, have you even attached the third anchor latch? Huh?"
00:28:57.193,00:28:59.154,I'm sorry. Daddy's sorry.
00:28:59.237,00:29:00.238,Booyah!
00:29:00.321,00:29:01.156,Come on.
00:29:02.615,00:29:04.784,-That's in there. That's sturdy. -That's steady.
00:29:04.868,00:29:06.745,-Thank you. -I was a nanny for four years.
00:29:08.121,00:29:09.164,What?
00:29:09.247,00:29:10.373,"She's awake, man."
00:29:10.457,00:29:12.792,"-No, she ain't. -Yes, she is. I just heard her."
00:29:12.876,00:29:15.128,"-I don't have a bottle, man. -Oh man."
00:29:15.211,00:29:17.630,Here's the formula. All right.
00:29:19.716,00:29:21.134,You just cut the top.
00:29:49.662,00:29:50.538,Ha!
00:29:51.623,00:29:52.707,Hiyo!
00:29:52.791,00:29:55.251,"Oh, where's mom?"
00:29:55.335,00:29:57.504,"Oh, mom's an astronaut trainin' at NASA."
00:29:57.587,00:29:59.088,Where is mom today?
00:29:59.172,00:30:01.424,"Oh, mom is servin' time in San Quentin."
00:30:01.508,00:30:02.550,Where's her mom?
00:30:03.468,00:30:07.096,"Me, I can't wait till Monday comes so I can get away from my kids screaming."
00:30:07.180,00:30:10.350,Wow. I bet they're probably psyched to get away from you too.
00:30:17.816,00:30:18.775,Mmm.
00:30:48.221,00:30:49.639,We brought you some flowers.
00:30:52.725,00:30:55.770,"Oh, I thought I should tell you that you got one of your wishes."
00:30:56.855,00:30:58.481,I'm changing a lot of diapers.
00:30:59.816,00:31:01.943,This little kid here poops a lot.
00:31:09.951,00:31:10.952,"Cute baby, papi."
00:31:16.082,00:31:17.292,"-Thanks, man. -All right."
00:31:18.084,00:31:19.127,Mmm.
00:31:19.210,00:31:22.839,"Look, Maddy, we're about to pass the school that Mom wanted you to go to."
00:31:23.756,00:31:25.884,Which means that that's where you gonna go.
00:31:26.718,00:31:28.845,"They got nuns there, and you'll like nuns."
00:31:29.596,00:31:32.932,You'll like nuns 'cause nuns dress like penguins. That's a fact.
00:31:33.016,00:31:34.100,And they're celibate.
00:31:37.645,00:31:39.230,"I know, you fussin'."
00:31:39.314,00:31:41.774,"I know you don't wanna be celibate, but you're gonna be."
00:31:43.109,00:31:43.943,Good talk.
00:31:58.833,00:32:00.293,"Come on, Maddy."
00:32:00.376,00:32:03.087,What? What? What? What? What? What? What?
00:32:03.171,00:32:05.173,"Roller coaster. Come on, Maddy."
00:32:05.256,00:32:08.134,Here it is. Goin' down this track.
00:32:08.843,00:32:12.013,Goin' down. It's gettin' rocky and shocky.
00:32:23.524,00:32:28.279,"I'm seri-- It's just, like, she will not stop cryin'. She won't."
00:32:28.363,00:32:32.533,"Well, sometimes I would sing you a little lullaby, and that would quiet you right down."
00:32:45.088,00:32:46.923,Try to sing higher.
00:32:59.394,00:33:01.229,That-- Well… She's not a clapper.
00:33:04.148,00:33:06.609,"Your daddy said go to bed, Maddy."
00:33:07.610,00:33:10.029,Your father is tired.
00:33:10.113,00:33:12.532,"-That's not abuse. Yeah, that's not abuse. -Yep."
00:33:12.615,00:33:13.449,That's borderline.
00:33:17.662,00:33:21.541,Is it weird that breastfeeding kind of turns me on a little bit?
00:33:23.960,00:33:26.587,I just want him to die. Is that wrong?
00:33:30.216,00:33:31.217,Excuse me.
00:33:31.300,00:33:34.262,"Um, I'm sorry. AA is down the hall to the right."
00:33:34.345,00:33:35.388,I'm not here for that.
00:33:35.471,00:33:37.974,I'm not… I'm not here for the AA meeting. That's not why I'm here.
00:33:38.057,00:33:43.396,"She, uh… she just went to sleep, but she's been, like, crying for hours."
00:33:43.479,00:33:46.691,I mean hours to the point where I'm… I'm exhausted.
00:33:46.816,00:33:48.651,"And my face hurts, and I'm getting frustrated."
00:33:48.735,00:33:50.903,And I don't know how to break the stroller down.
00:33:50.987,00:33:53.072,I don't know how to fold it up.
00:33:53.156,00:33:56.784,"Okay. Well, sorry, but this is a group for new mothers."
00:33:56.868,00:34:00.038,"You're lying, because on that sign out there, it says parents."
00:34:00.121,00:34:02.290,"I'm a parent, and I don't know what the hell I'm doing."
00:34:02.373,00:34:04.792,I don't have nobody else to talk to about this shit.
00:34:04.876,00:34:07.962,"Speaking of shit, the girl's got some stuff flyin' out of her ass."
00:34:08.046,00:34:09.130,It's like a fire hose.
00:34:09.213,00:34:11.716,"I don't know if it's normal or not, but it's two different kinds."
00:34:11.799,00:34:13.301,She can either hit you with a streamer.
00:34:13.384,00:34:16.804,"That's when it's all put together, and it's… it's a little solid."
00:34:16.888,00:34:18.306,And it's… it's a direct hit.
00:34:18.389,00:34:19.849,Or she'll buckshot you.
00:34:19.932,00:34:23.227,And that's… that's that spray. It's… it's a quick… whop!
00:34:23.311,00:34:27.690,I need help. I need the crying to stop.
00:34:27.774,00:34:30.026,How do I make the crying stop?
00:34:31.819,00:34:35.406,"Okay, um, my oldest had colic for the first couple of months."
00:34:35.490,00:34:41.788,-What's colic? -It's when babies cry for hours on end without any reason until you feel like your eyes are about to pop out.
00:34:43.289,00:34:44.624,I gave the baby colic.
00:34:44.707,00:34:46.834,"No, that's… that's not how colic works."
00:34:49.587,00:34:51.047,And that's how I gave the baby colic.
00:34:51.130,00:34:54.926,You don't give a baby colic. It's more of a digestive thing.
00:34:57.595,00:35:00.223,"Thing that worked for me was white noise, surprisingly."
00:35:00.306,00:35:01.349,White noise?
00:35:27.583,00:35:30.628,"And then looking ahead, I'm gonna turn it over to Matt."
00:35:30.711,00:35:33.923,And he's gonna show you how this all can work for your customers.
00:35:34.006,00:35:35.633,"All right, Matt, you're up."
00:35:44.267,00:35:46.686,"Nah, this guy never sleeps. He's deep in thought."
00:35:46.769,00:35:49.689,"Yeah, deep in-- That's exactly what it is."
00:35:49.772,00:35:51.274,Very deep in thought.
00:35:51.357,00:35:53.109,"Thank you. Thank you, Howard."
00:35:53.192,00:36:11.294,"And the reason why is because I'm so excited… With this upgrade, there's thousands, and I mean thousands of preset visuals from flooring to, uh… to walls to lighting that really offers-- You hear cryin'?"
00:36:16.507,00:36:18.509,so my nose whistles sometimes. Maybe that's it?
00:36:18.593,00:36:22.680,"No, that's… that's not what it is. I'm sorry. Excuse me for a second, please."
00:36:22.763,00:36:32.690,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Where… -Huh? Huh? -Okay. Vacuum, yeah."
00:36:32.773,00:36:34.150,Come on. Shh.
00:36:34.233,00:36:36.944,We're gonna vacuum. We're gonna vacuum.
00:36:37.028,00:36:37.904,"Hey, Maddy!"
00:36:39.864,00:36:41.532,"-What's going on? -Come on, Maddy."
00:36:41.616,00:36:43.618,What's going on now? What are you doing?
00:36:43.701,00:36:45.786,-What's going on? -He's doing the vacuum thing.
00:36:47.830,00:36:49.582,-Okay. -She likes the vacuum noise.
00:36:55.588,00:37:00.301,"But she goes on these crying jags, and it's impossible to really get her to stop and calm down."
00:37:00.384,00:37:03.262,-Does she wanna try sucking on my pinkie? -No.
00:37:03.346,00:37:05.097,"-I used to help with my kids. -No. Howard, no."
00:37:05.181,00:37:06.682,-They loved to suck on the pinkie. -Not sanitary.
00:37:06.766,00:37:10.061,"Maybe this will help, mate. It's, um… it's a white noise app."
00:37:12.813,00:37:16.192,My baby always calmed down with skin-to-skin contact.
00:37:19.820,00:37:22.657,And I want you to notice the easy map-tree interface as well.
00:37:22.740,00:37:26.285,"Once again, it's about giving our customers what they want, which is the simplicity."
00:37:26.369,00:37:28.663,"Right? Isn't that what you want, huh?"
00:37:28.746,00:37:30.164,-They want simplicity. -Okay.
00:37:30.248,00:37:34.001,"I got a problem now. This is a place of business, right?"
00:37:34.085,00:37:39.465,"It's not a place of babies. In here, I'm kinda… I'm the designated asshole."
00:37:39.548,00:37:40.591,Who designated you?
00:37:44.345,00:37:46.806,You don't think there's an asshole above me?
00:37:46.889,00:37:49.725,"And above that asshole, another asshole."
00:37:49.809,00:37:51.185,An asshole chain.
00:37:51.269,00:37:53.145,It's an asshole chain. That's exactly what it is.
00:37:55.815,00:37:59.110,"Just wanted to say, great presentation, Matt."
00:38:02.280,00:38:03.990,Thank you. Thank you for that.
00:38:04.073,00:38:06.075,It means a lot since I'm about to get fired.
00:38:12.581,00:38:13.541,Go on. Finish.
00:38:13.624,00:38:16.502,"Hey, you're not that lucky. I'm not firing you."
00:38:16.585,00:38:20.339,I just happen to be worried about you. When's the last time you had a break?
00:38:20.423,00:38:22.842,"You know, there's a new thing called babysitters."
00:38:24.885,00:38:28.723,My name is Summer. I'm going to pick you up now.
00:38:29.557,00:38:32.184,"Oh, she doesn't speak English yet. She's just a baby."
00:38:32.268,00:38:35.021,"Oh, I believe you have to treat the infant with respect."
00:38:35.646,00:38:38.274,"Right, Maddy? We've got this."
00:38:48.284,00:38:49.785,"Yeah, yeah."
00:38:57.293,00:38:59.128,You got a babysitter. Have a good time.
00:38:59.211,00:39:01.630,"You need this, bro. You a single parent now."
00:39:01.714,00:39:04.383,Which is crazy to me to say this. Matt is a dad.
00:39:04.467,00:39:06.927,To say that out loud still sound-- Matt is a dad.
00:39:07.011,00:39:08.721,That is crazy. So insane.
00:39:08.804,00:39:10.639,-That's crazy. Hey. -What are you doin'?
00:39:10.723,00:39:12.224,Nothin'. I'm just listening to you.
00:39:15.644,00:39:17.605,-What? -What do you mean? What was that?
00:39:17.688,00:39:20.149,You don't see the diversity just walked past? Huh?
00:39:20.232,00:39:22.151,-All the flavors. For all of us. -Okay.
00:39:22.234,00:39:24.195,"I gotta get going, man. I'm going home."
00:39:26.989,00:39:28.949,"-Excuse me. -Matt! Matt! Matt! Hey, hey, Matt!"
00:39:29.033,00:39:30.993,"-What, man? -What's up? Where you goin'?"
00:39:31.077,00:39:32.620,"What do you mean, where I'm goin'? Home!"
00:39:32.703,00:39:34.955,-Why are you leavin'? -Because I'm not havin' a good time.
00:39:35.039,00:39:41.712,"What? We got girls back there. We're taking shots, having a good-- I don't care about no girls, man. What makes you think I care about girls now?"
00:39:41.796,00:39:43.506,"Man, I brought you out to have a good time."
00:39:43.589,00:39:47.051,"I don't want your version of a good time, Jordan."
00:39:47.134,00:39:48.094,I don't want it.
00:39:48.177,00:39:50.179,"Okay, look. I get it. You haven't been out since Liz."
00:39:50.262,00:39:51.972,"-But it's-- -Shut the-- Hey, man."
00:39:53.516,00:39:54.350,Don't.
00:39:55.935,00:39:57.645,Don't do that. Don't bring Liz up.
00:39:58.854,00:39:59.688,Don't do that.
00:40:03.776,00:40:04.693,Idiot.
00:40:05.653,00:40:07.446,-Say bye. -Bye.
00:40:07.530,00:40:08.531,Goodbye.
00:40:12.284,00:40:15.454,All we need is us. We don't need no one else.
00:40:37.726,00:40:41.272,"That's daddy's new best friend. He brings us our formula, our diapers."
00:40:41.355,00:40:44.859,He gives us everything we need so we don't have to talk to people again.
00:40:44.942,00:40:47.862,"If anybody else ring this bell, they die. You hear me?"
00:40:56.912,00:40:58.164,"I said, No ringin'."
00:40:58.914,00:41:01.167,"I said, No ringin' the damn bell."
00:41:02.460,00:41:03.669,I'm gonna kill somebody.
00:41:06.964,00:41:08.466,Good morning.
00:41:08.549,00:41:09.425,-Hi. -Hey.
00:41:09.508,00:41:10.676,Where is my grandbaby?
00:41:10.759,00:41:12.928,What are you-- Is she dressed?
00:41:13.012,00:41:16.307,"-What are you doing here, Marion? -Well, it's Maddy's pediatrician visit."
00:41:16.390,00:41:19.310,"Oh, shit! Is it Thursday already? Shit!"
00:41:19.393,00:41:23.606,"Yeah, you didn't forget the pediatrician's visit, did you?"
00:41:23.689,00:41:26.066,I didn't forget anything. You just caught me.
00:41:26.150,00:41:28.319,We was about to leave. She just got out of the tub.
00:41:30.029,00:41:31.113,Good.
00:41:33.699,00:41:35.201,How's she been eating?
00:41:35.284,00:41:39.788,"Uh… I mean, okay, I guess, you know?"
00:41:39.872,00:41:43.876,"She, um… For the most part, I… I think it's fine."
00:41:43.959,00:41:48.339,"Every once in a while, if she's sleeping, I may let her go, like, an extra hour or something."
00:41:48.422,00:41:50.591,And how about you? How are you doing?
00:41:53.385,00:41:56.096,-It's about-- -How is Maddy? Is she okay?
00:41:58.807,00:42:01.894,I know that. I'm… I'm actually nothin'.
00:42:03.187,00:42:06.023,"-I'm a joke, okay? Lis-- -Matt, you're not a joke."
00:42:06.106,00:42:07.233,Maddy is doing great.
00:42:07.316,00:42:11.612,She's moved up to the 60th percentile in weight and 70th in height.
00:42:11.695,00:42:13.864,You can start feeding her when she's hungry.
00:42:14.657,00:42:19.245,"Look, I hope you don't mind me saying this, but your wife would be very proud of you."
00:42:36.345,00:42:37.513,"It's okay, Marion."
00:42:43.811,00:42:45.187,You hungry? You wanna go get lunch?
00:42:45.271,00:42:49.275,"Uh, no, no. Actually, um, I gotta get back to the airport."
00:42:49.358,00:42:51.235,"-Already? -Yeah, yeah."
00:42:52.111,00:42:54.572,I told Mike that I was spending the day at the spa.
00:42:55.155,00:42:59.868,You told-- Want me to take you? I can give you a ride.
00:42:59.952,00:43:01.912,"No, she needs to get to her little nap."
00:43:01.996,00:43:03.163,You want a little nap?
00:43:03.247,00:43:09.044,"Oh God. Matthew, today was a good day for you as a parent."
00:43:09.670,00:43:14.883,You keep all these little victories like you had today in a little box inside you.
00:43:15.759,00:43:18.137,They'll be your most prized possessions.
00:43:19.013,00:43:26.979,And don't let me have to come back up here before Father Mayfield is going to christen her in Minnesota.
00:43:27.062,00:43:29.398,"Saint Augustine's, three weeks. I'll see you there."
00:43:29.481,00:43:32.192,"Wait, what do you-- Minnesota, three weeks. See you."
00:43:32.276,00:43:34.236,"-Minnesota in three-- -Grammy loves you, Maddy."
00:43:34.320,00:43:37.281,Nobody… nobody said nothing to me about Minnesota.
00:43:43.287,00:43:45.372,"Yes, you did. You were hungry."
00:43:45.456,00:43:46.540,Huh?
00:43:46.624,00:43:47.625,"I'm hungry, Daddy."
00:43:52.421,00:43:57.885,"-She's a cutie. -Yeah… Oh, shit. Oh, shit."
00:43:57.968,00:43:59.345,I'm so sorry.
00:43:59.428,00:44:01.180,-Hey! -Yeah!
00:44:05.559,00:44:07.978,-What a bundle of joy! -Hey!
00:44:09.396,00:44:12.566,-Got it? Okay. -Good? Good? Come on now.
00:44:44.973,00:44:48.185,Remember when I caught you guys messin' around in here?
00:44:48.268,00:44:49.687,Oh my goodness.
00:44:49.770,00:44:50.771,"Yes, I do."
00:44:51.689,00:44:53.857,You chased me with Mike's hockey stick.
00:44:58.529,00:45:01.281,You thought you were gonna get lucky that night.
00:45:01.365,00:45:03.367,"You got damn lucky, didn't you?"
00:45:06.370,00:45:07.788,I've never been that fast.
00:45:07.871,00:45:09.248,The room looks different.
00:45:09.748,00:45:14.628,"Oh, I brought a lot of things down from the attic, from her childhood."
00:45:15.295,00:45:17.589,I like it. I like it a lot.
00:45:18.966,00:45:21.176,"At first, I spent whole days in here."
00:45:22.594,00:45:24.346,Whole days.
00:45:24.430,00:45:28.684,"Just lyin' on the bed, smelling the pillows."
00:45:28.767,00:45:31.353,Cryin'. Pissed.
00:45:31.437,00:45:35.816,I'm down to one hour each day. That's all I allow myself now.
00:45:37.818,00:45:42.781,I'd like for you to let Maddy come and stay with us sometimes.
00:45:43.615,00:45:44.742,When she's bigger.
00:45:45.534,00:45:47.244,She could spend summers here.
00:45:47.327,00:45:48.203,Summers?
00:45:48.287,00:45:50.998,"Matt, she needs family."
00:45:53.751,00:45:55.377,She'll need a woman in her life.
00:45:57.588,00:46:00.382,And I don't mean some woman you met in the club.
00:46:01.049,00:46:02.259,Or on Tinders.
00:46:08.182,00:46:14.271,I'm not on Tinder. And what are you-- How do you know about Tinder? Where are you gettin' this stuff?
00:46:18.817,00:46:25.783,"Hey, I'm… You think maybe you can watch Maddy for me tonight?"
00:46:25.866,00:46:27.659,Yeah! Yes!
00:46:27.743,00:46:31.205,"So I can go meet up with some friends, go have a drink."
00:46:31.288,00:46:34.041,"-Yeah, you do that. Yeah! -All right. Okay."
00:46:56.772,00:46:57.773,Thank you.
00:47:01.276,00:47:02.152,Mom?
00:47:03.320,00:47:04.696,Did Dad like having a baby?
00:47:05.697,00:47:07.115,"Oh, he loved babies."
00:47:07.199,00:47:10.118,That's why he had so many of them with so many different women.
00:47:11.995,00:47:13.247,"Yeah, but he married you."
00:47:13.914,00:47:15.123,"Yes, lucky me."
00:47:15.833,00:47:18.085,I was lucky 'cause I had you.
00:47:20.170,00:47:23.215,I'm just hopin' I can be half as good a mom as you were with me.
00:47:25.467,00:47:26.552,You're a good mom.
00:47:28.804,00:47:31.139,"Maddy, guess what?"
00:47:31.765,00:47:32.724,See the baby?
00:47:35.060,00:47:38.647,"Isn't she beautiful? Sister… She did so good, huh?"
00:48:23.942,00:48:25.152,-Wake up! -I'm up.
00:48:25.235,00:48:30.032,You gotta treat it like a… like you're sneaking up on it and grab it.
00:48:30.115,00:48:34.745,"Over, under, over."
00:48:36.038,00:48:36.872,Okay.
00:48:37.956,00:48:43.086,"Okay, that's one. Just let me-- What is this?"
00:48:45.005,00:48:48.300,I think it's a new… a new… a new look.
00:48:48.383,00:48:51.678,I think it's a new hairstyle that can catch on if given a chance.
00:48:52.471,00:48:53.472,Just stay still.
00:48:53.972,00:48:59.937,"We gotta go top. Let me-- Hold on, okay?"
00:49:11.823,00:49:15.327,but skirts make me feel like I forgot my pants.
00:49:15.410,00:49:17.371,But she said it's a rule.
00:49:17.454,00:49:20.791,Rules? We don't need no stinkin' rules.
00:49:22.709,00:49:26.505,"-Maddy, do you like goin' to school here? -Mommy wanted me to be here. I like it."
00:49:27.589,00:49:29.299,That's all I needed to hear then.
00:49:29.383,00:49:31.385,"All right, go ahead. I love you."
00:49:31.468,00:49:32.469,Love you too.
00:49:35.138,00:49:36.223,"-Bye, Daddy. -Bye."
00:49:41.895,00:49:44.523,"Mr. Logelin, we need to discuss the dress code."
00:49:44.606,00:49:46.191,"Hey, you have a good day, okay?"
00:49:52.114,00:49:54.700,"Maddy, it's on you. You wanna check or bet?"
00:49:54.783,00:49:55.826,All in.
00:49:55.909,00:49:57.744,All in again?
00:49:57.828,00:49:58.787,-Wow! -All in again?
00:50:02.040,00:50:05.127,-She looks serious. -I don't know if she's bluffin' or not.
00:50:05.210,00:50:07.254,-Seriously. -Let me see your face.
00:50:11.383,00:50:12.884,How can you break that down? You can't.
00:50:12.968,00:50:14.803,I don't know what you got going on in that head.
00:50:14.886,00:50:19.307,I can see into the mind of Maddy. Hold on.
00:50:24.312,00:50:26.606,"I got nothin', guys. I'm out. I fold."
00:50:29.568,00:50:31.653,Look at this. Bam. Queens.
00:50:31.737,00:50:33.238,-What do you have? -What do you got?
00:50:36.908,00:50:38.869,-No! -Pocket rockets.
00:50:38.952,00:50:40.662,-Pocket aces. -Okay. That was a good hand.
00:50:43.248,00:50:45.876,"-Scoop it. It's yours. -What? Okay, that's all you."
00:50:47.669,00:50:49.421,You're not gonna eat all that today either.
00:50:49.504,00:50:50.505,Ship it!
00:50:56.595,00:50:59.222,"Did you… did you eat your veggies? What is that, cake?"
00:51:11.818,00:51:14.613,"Oh, I do. Crazy one's mine. That's Maddy."
00:51:21.328,00:51:22.412,Are you Matt?
00:51:23.246,00:51:24.081,I am Matt.
00:51:25.540,00:51:29.669,I think I know why Oscar and Rose insisted I come today.
00:51:29.753,00:51:31.963,"-I think we're being set up. -Oh, wow."
00:51:35.133,00:51:37.677,-Funny thing is I said the same thing. -Yeah?
00:51:37.761,00:51:40.680,"We should mess with 'em. Throw your drink in my face, make it look real bad."
00:51:40.764,00:51:43.642,Or we could break up with them as friends.
00:51:43.725,00:51:46.394,You know what? I've been looking for new white people.
00:51:47.395,00:51:49.481,I have. I really have.
00:51:52.150,00:51:53.151,What do you do?
00:51:53.235,00:51:54.277,"Uh, I'm an animator."
00:51:54.361,00:51:56.905,An animator? That's cool. That's different.
00:51:56.988,00:51:59.783,"I, uh… I work with this guy."
00:51:59.866,00:52:00.826,I work with Oscar.
00:52:02.285,00:52:03.495,-Hey. -That's my name.
00:52:03.578,00:52:06.289,Don't wear it out. Just kidding. You can say it as much as you want.
00:52:07.249,00:52:11.253,"So, you two meeting at, uh, Oliver's birthday party."
00:52:11.336,00:52:12.170,Yeah.
00:52:12.838,00:52:14.214,-Pretty great. -What are the odds?
00:52:14.297,00:52:15.715,"What are the odds, you know?"
00:52:16.216,00:52:24.057,"I mean, you know, you're great, and you're great and… It's just, uh… -It's not a setup though. You know? -Got it. Got it."
00:52:24.141,00:52:25.892,"-Very smooth, by the way, Oscar. -Yeah."
00:52:26.935,00:52:27.811,-Thank you. -Yeah.
00:52:27.894,00:52:28.728,Great.
00:52:30.105,00:52:31.231,Thank you.
00:52:33.692,00:52:34.526,Unreal.
00:52:38.029,00:52:39.072,Stop playin'.
00:52:39.698,00:52:44.327,"Um, I'm not playing. My name is-- Well, Lizzie is what my friends call me."
00:52:48.582,00:52:49.583,You're an animator.
00:52:50.375,00:52:53.503,-What have you animated? -I work on a show called Lucky Jim.
00:52:53.587,00:52:56.923,Lucky Jim. I know what that is. Maddy loves that show.
00:52:58.091,00:52:59.759,You let her watch Lucky Jim?
00:53:00.802,00:53:01.887,"Yeah, it's a cartoon."
00:53:02.762,00:53:04.014,Have you ever watched it?
00:53:04.556,00:53:06.474,It's called Lucky Jim because he gets lucky.
00:53:08.351,00:53:10.061,-You talkin' about sex? -Uh-huh.
00:53:11.605,00:53:14.900,"-I thought he was, like, a leprechaun. -Yeah, he's a leprechaun."
00:53:14.983,00:53:19.321,"A really lucky, really horny leprechaun."
00:53:21.156,00:53:23.700,"Is there, like, a warning on it that kids shouldn't watch it?"
00:53:23.783,00:53:25.493,There's definitely a warning.
00:53:34.085,00:53:36.213,And now that rainbow's up and disappeared.
00:53:36.296,00:53:38.173,I think you're full of horse blarney.
00:53:38.256,00:53:41.134,"I'd like to show you what I'm full of, me lassie, if you've no objection."
00:53:46.473,00:53:47.515,I'm seeing stars.
00:53:50.518,00:53:51.394,That's it.
00:53:52.979,00:53:55.065,"-Oh, that's off. -Daddy, they were about to wrestle."
00:53:55.148,00:53:59.945,"I know that. I know that. And that's a little… It's a little too violent for you to watch, honey."
00:54:00.445,00:54:02.113,"-Wait, did you call her? -Zip it."
00:54:02.197,00:54:04.991,"-What do you mean, Zip it? -Zip it. Don't be a bonehead."
00:54:05.075,00:54:06.993,-Why I gotta be a bonehead? -Don't be a bonehead.
00:54:07.077,00:54:09.454,"-Maddy can handle it, right? -Stop. What'd I ask you to do?"
00:54:09.537,00:54:10.580,Handle what?
00:54:10.664,00:54:12.374,"-Jordan, what'd I say? -Look, I got this."
00:54:12.457,00:54:13.625,"-Jordan, I don't-- -I got this."
00:54:13.708,00:54:15.669,-Jordan-- -That's what friends are for.
00:54:15.752,00:54:17.921,"Sometimes two adults meet each other, right?"
00:54:18.004,00:54:19.631,And they fall in love.
00:54:19.714,00:54:21.675,And then they both are nearsighted.
00:54:22.342,00:54:25.303,Have that in common and all these beautiful things.
00:54:25.387,00:54:27.555,They take long walks in the park together.
00:54:27.639,00:54:29.641,"You know, you find that special someone."
00:54:30.517,00:54:36.856,But then they get real petty one day and kick you in your back 'cause you snoring while you sleep.
00:54:36.940,00:54:38.566,-What? -You're sleeping on the floor.
00:54:38.650,00:54:39.859,-You're all messed up. -What?
00:54:39.943,00:54:42.612,-Carpet burns on your arm. -That's-- What are you-- That's enough!
00:54:42.696,00:54:44.155,"-It's not enough, okay? -It is enough."
00:54:44.239,00:54:46.616,You don't know if you're gonna find a special someone.
00:54:46.700,00:54:50.412,"You're not talking about nobody but yourself-- You know he's talking about himself, right?"
00:54:50.495,00:54:58.878,"I know. But if they liked each other, and then they didn't like each other, couldn't they like each other again? And wouldn't that be fun?"
00:55:00.130,00:55:01.965,"-Yeah, Maddy. -Wow."
00:55:02.549,00:55:05.051,"Give me a high five or something, a hug. Come here."
00:55:05.135,00:55:07.137,-I mean… -You are brilliant. You a genius.
00:55:07.220,00:55:09.389,Gotta be to make sense of all that stuff you just said.
00:55:09.472,00:55:12.475,"Don't be a hater. I wanna-- Look, you are so smart."
00:55:12.559,00:55:14.394,You definitely don't get that from your daddy.
00:55:18.231,00:55:20.191,"Okay, stay together. No running."
00:55:20.275,00:55:22.277,"Hey, Maddy, are you a boy?"
00:55:22.360,00:55:23.445,Are you a girl?
00:55:23.528,00:55:24.696,"Zip it, bonehead!"
00:55:24.779,00:55:25.780,Madeline!
00:55:27.407,00:55:30.410,I really don't understand this. The kid was teasin' her.
00:55:30.493,00:55:32.370,Maybe you should talk to that kid's parents.
00:55:32.454,00:55:33.288,I have.
00:55:33.371,00:55:37.250,But he was teasing her because she was the only girl wearing pants.
00:55:37.959,00:55:41.338,What if a boy wanted to come to school dressed in a skirt?
00:55:42.422,00:55:45.175,Then that's that boy's business. It's the 21st century.
00:55:45.258,00:55:49.846,"Mr. Logelin, Madeline is in kindergarten. She doesn't have a mother to model after."
00:55:49.929,00:55:54.351,I am well aware of what my daughter doesn't have.
00:55:55.685,00:55:59.731,You have to at least show her that wearing girls' clothing is an option.
00:56:00.565,00:56:03.526,I just don't… I just don't understand why nuns are so tough.
00:56:04.194,00:56:10.116,"Why are you guys so tough? Like, what… what is it that happens in nun camp that makes you guys this strict?"
00:56:12.494,00:56:15.914,I'm not gonna say anything else because I don't wanna get struck by lightning.
00:56:15.997,00:56:18.708,"Okay, here you go, Maddy. What about these here?"
00:56:19.584,00:56:22.003,No. I want these.
00:56:25.548,00:56:29.677,"Um… Okay, if that's what you want."
00:56:30.845,00:56:31.846,Are you going out?
00:56:31.930,00:56:36.684,"Yes. Rose is coming over, and Daddy's gonna go out."
00:56:39.938,00:56:41.106,"No, not with Oscar."
00:56:41.856,00:56:43.441,With Jordan?
00:56:43.525,00:56:44.984,"No, not with Jordan."
00:56:45.652,00:56:46.569,A lady?
00:56:47.862,00:56:49.030,"Yes, it's a lady."
00:56:49.823,00:56:50.907,Does that bother you?
00:56:50.990,00:56:53.159,-Does it bother you? -I asked first.
00:56:53.243,00:56:56.037,Is it Sister Kathleen from school?
00:56:56.121,00:56:59.165,"No, it is not Sister Kathleen from school."
00:56:59.249,00:57:00.959,Then that's okay. Who is it?
00:57:01.042,00:57:02.836,It's a lady friend from the birthday party.
00:57:07.966,00:57:08.967,You know what?
00:57:09.634,00:57:11.177,I got a surprise for you.
00:57:11.928,00:57:15.432,"See, I was gonna wait till you got older. This was Mommy's jewelry box."
00:57:15.515,00:57:19.477,I want you to pick something out of here that can be just for you.
00:57:19.561,00:57:22.272,-Anything? -Anything you want.
00:57:23.731,00:57:24.566,Hmm.
00:57:25.817,00:57:26.651,This one.
00:57:30.321,00:57:31.156,Wow.
00:57:32.407,00:57:33.450,I like this one.
00:57:45.336,00:57:46.880,Such a good choice.
00:57:49.549,00:57:50.884,"Hmm, let me put it on you."
00:57:56.514,00:57:58.183,Is she in this? Mommy?
00:57:59.601,00:58:07.775,"Yeah, she's in there. She's in you. She's in me. She's in… She's in whoever she touched."
00:58:10.653,00:58:12.030,And what did she say to that?
00:58:12.113,00:58:15.533,"Oh, she said that her mom is in her because of DNA."
00:58:16.242,00:58:18.578,"-What? -Yeah, that's-- I swear to God."
00:58:18.661,00:58:20.205,What? Is she some kind of genius?
00:58:20.288,00:58:22.832,You know what it is? Maddy just asks a lot of questions.
00:58:25.251,00:58:30.131,"They were talking about DNA at the show, so I tried to explain to her what DNA was."
00:58:32.926,00:58:33.927,What?
00:58:34.969,00:58:38.097,"Um, I guess I'm kind of surprised you're still single."
00:58:38.181,00:58:40.350,All those hot single moms at the kiddie park.
00:58:40.433,00:58:41.809,Stop it. Stop.
00:58:41.893,00:58:44.604,There's nothing hot about single parents.
00:58:44.687,00:58:48.816,"We are overworked, sleep-deprived, covered in baby vomit."
00:58:48.900,00:58:50.193,-That's hot. -That's hot?
00:58:52.320,00:58:55.281,-You're funny. You're very funny. -You've just been through a lot.
00:58:56.366,00:58:57.283,You and Maddy.
00:58:57.367,00:58:58.785,We have been through a lot.
00:58:59.661,00:59:07.544,"But we're okay, you know? We, uh… We're on our own, and we're… we're fine."
00:59:07.627,00:59:09.170,"I get that, you know?"
00:59:09.754,00:59:12.715,"I'm on my own, and I'm fine too. I like where I'm at."
00:59:12.799,00:59:14.384,-Yeah? -Uh-huh.
00:59:14.968,00:59:18.638,"So, you, um… you must have had a good example of how to be a dad?"
00:59:18.721,00:59:21.057,"No. No, I did not."
00:59:21.641,00:59:23.893,"Actually, I had the complete opposite of that."
00:59:24.394,00:59:26.729,I know what not to do because of my dad.
00:59:30.817,00:59:32.277,"I'm gonna kiss you now, okay?"
00:59:33.778,00:59:34.612,Okay.
00:59:35.697,00:59:36.781,I think I'm prepared.
00:59:38.157,00:59:41.119,"Oh, do you prefer my false teeth in or out?"
00:59:41.202,00:59:45.331,"Leave 'em in, just in case I mess up, so I got something to blame it on."
00:59:45.415,00:59:46.416,Sure.
00:59:57.176,01:00:01.347,Does it… bother you that my name is Lizzie?
01:00:03.641,01:00:04.475,No.
01:00:05.518,01:00:07.395,But you can change it if you want to.
01:00:08.146,01:00:16.529,"Okay. You know, if you wanna call me anything like, Your Highness, or like, my mom was gonna name me Majesty."
01:00:16.613,01:00:18.948,Anything along those lines is great.
01:00:19.032,01:00:20.867,Okay. Noted.
01:00:20.950,01:00:22.410,-Mm-hmm. -What about Hank?
01:00:27.498,01:00:28.333,Why?
01:00:28.416,01:00:30.501,-You said anything I want. -Okay.
01:00:30.585,01:00:32.503,"-Okay? -Okay, we'll… we'll test it out."
01:00:32.587,01:00:35.715,-Okay. Let's test it out right now. -Is that a deal? Okay. We'll test it out.
01:00:35.798,01:00:38.259,"Go. Go get in the… go get in the house safe, Hank."
01:00:48.686,01:00:49.687,Good night.
01:00:57.862,01:01:01.324,"Wow. Wow, wow, wow."
01:01:01.991,01:01:02.825,Mmm.
01:01:04.077,01:01:05.286,Hey.
01:01:05.370,01:01:06.287,You're late.
01:01:06.371,01:01:07.580,"What do you mean, I'm late?"
01:01:07.664,01:01:09.916,You told Rose you'd be home at 11.
01:01:09.999,01:01:14.087,"Well, guess what? It is 11:13 right now."
01:01:20.385,01:01:21.260,-Did you? -Uh-huh.
01:01:21.344,01:01:23.805,What are you gonna do? Are you gonna ground me because I'm late?
01:01:23.888,01:01:25.348,Huh? Is that what you wanna do?
01:01:25.431,01:01:28.351,"Do you wanna ground your dad because he's late, huh?"
01:01:28.434,01:01:29.977,"-Yes, yes. -There you go."
01:01:30.061,01:01:31.312,-Good. -Are your shoes tied?
01:01:31.396,01:01:32.897,-I don't think his shoes are tied. -Hey.
01:01:32.980,01:01:34.357,"-Hey, Maddy. -Where's Daddy?"
01:01:35.233,01:01:45.535,"Oh, um… Yeah, so, your dad had to work late, but, uh, we wanted to come watch you play and then maybe get some ice cream afterwards."
01:01:45.618,01:01:50.790,"'Cause he's not doin' anything fun with anyone, and I am telling you the truth."
01:02:07.473,01:02:11.811,I'm gonna walk you through how our software can help you redesign every aspect of your new mall.
01:02:11.894,01:02:20.278,"What you gotta see-- What are you-- Sorry, it's Bring Your Kid to Work Day, so you can only imagine the-- -No, it's not. -Yes, it is."
01:02:20.361,01:02:23.948,"-Let's go out. -No. Wait a second. Stop it, Maddy. Stop."
01:02:30.413,01:02:42.759,"Wait, put my key-- Give me the keys. Stop. What are you doing? What is-- Um… Bringing Up Baby."
01:02:44.010,01:02:48.097,"Let me think more recent. Let me think, like, not before the 1940s."
01:02:48.181,01:02:49.015,Ask me mine.
01:02:50.099,01:02:52.935,-What's your favorite movie? -I'm Gonna Git You Sucka.
01:03:03.780,01:03:05.990,I'm serious. I thought there was something on the window.
01:03:06.073,01:03:08.201,"No, I don't fall for your tricks no more."
01:03:08.284,01:03:11.704,What? I thought something was on the window. I'm not gonna trick you.
01:03:16.334,01:03:18.044,Oh my gosh. There's a booger on your shirt.
01:03:24.592,01:03:27.428,"Um, before we eat, I gotta tell you somethin'."
01:03:28.054,01:03:29.972,-I gotta tell you somethin' important. -Okay.
01:03:30.056,01:03:34.977,"So, Saturday night I gotta go out, but Jennifer's mom said you can stay the night."
01:03:36.354,01:03:38.147,Why can't I come with you?
01:03:38.231,01:03:41.359,One reason why you can't come with me is I gotta do a bunch of grown-up stuff.
01:03:42.276,01:03:43.402,-All right? -Mmm. Yeah.
01:03:43.486,01:03:44.445,-Yeah? -Yeah.
01:03:46.864,01:03:48.366,Are you gonna sleep in those?
01:03:49.367,01:03:52.078,"You should take them off. Flip, flip."
01:03:52.662,01:03:54.038,"Okay, hop in."
01:04:04.757,01:04:06.968,"Good night, sweetie. Mommy loves you."
01:04:18.938,01:04:20.731,You wanna go back to my place?
01:04:21.774,01:04:25.403,-For what? You wanna play some poker? -I don't know how to play poker.
01:04:25.903,01:04:28.531,But I was thinking something even more fun than that.
01:04:29.282,01:04:30.116,Wow.
01:04:31.409,01:04:32.535,Is it Twister?
01:04:33.119,01:04:34.412,It's a form of Twister.
01:04:37.540,01:04:40.334,"All right, so now that I have this information, I wanna be honest."
01:04:40.418,01:04:41.252,Okay.
01:04:43.087,01:04:48.551,I just wanna make sure that I'm… -That I'm keeping Maddy-- -First.
01:04:48.634,01:04:51.012,"-Yes. Like, she has to be… -I know."
01:04:51.095,01:04:52.305,"…a priority, you know?"
01:04:53.472,01:04:56.475,-I understand. -That's… I really do. I get it.
01:04:56.559,01:04:57.602,Okay.
01:04:58.394,01:05:00.271,That's part of what I like about you.
01:05:01.564,01:05:07.528,"Well, then maybe I should teach you how to play poker."
01:05:14.994,01:05:18.122,Wow! This is amazing!
01:05:34.513,01:05:36.015,"Hey, y'all gotta stop it!"
01:05:36.766,01:05:37.600,That's enough.
01:05:37.683,01:05:48.361,"Hey, slow it do-- -You okay, Maddy? -Yes."
01:05:49.987,01:05:51.072,Yeah?
01:05:54.909,01:05:56.077,It's too loud!
01:05:57.286,01:05:58.329,"Come on, stay close."
01:06:00.539,01:06:03.084,Dad! You hit the clown!
01:06:05.044,01:06:06.671,"He… he okay, Maddy."
01:06:07.338,01:06:08.547,"Yeah, yeah."
01:06:10.174,01:06:12.385,"Come on, give me your hand. Give me your hand, honey."
01:06:12.885,01:06:14.553,"What an amazing day, huh?"
01:06:14.637,01:06:16.597,"-Mm-hmm. -It's, like, the best day ever."
01:06:16.681,01:06:19.058,I feel like nothing can mess up a day like this.
01:06:19.141,01:06:21.143,"-It was so perfect. -Yeah, it was very fun."
01:06:21.227,01:06:25.314,"Yeah. I wanted, um… I wanted to talk to you. Can I talk to you?"
01:06:25.398,01:06:34.198,"-Yeah. -So… I, um… I wanna introduce you to somebody that I've been seeing."
01:06:34.281,01:06:42.039,"It's like a… it's like a friend I got-- Well, I've been dating. I've… I've been dating a friend, right?"
01:06:42.957,01:06:49.839,"That I've… that I've been… that I've been seeing, but I… I think that you would… you would like her."
01:06:51.674,01:06:52.925,Can I have a lollipop?
01:06:53.009,01:06:56.137,"Absolutely. Yeah, let's… let's get you some more stuff."
01:06:56.220,01:06:57.722,"Some more candy, okay?"
01:06:57.805,01:07:00.433,"Maybe take one home, and we finish this talk?"
01:07:00.516,01:07:02.643,"Okay, but I don't wanna meet anyone."
01:07:10.526,01:07:12.111,"Hey, come… come here. Come here, Maddy."
01:07:14.113,01:07:15.197,-Hey. -Hey.
01:07:17.241,01:07:20.453,"Good. Uh, Maddy, this is… this is Lizzie."
01:07:20.536,01:07:27.334,"Hey! Well, you can call me Swan or Dude or Butthead!"
01:07:28.461,01:07:30.921,"Hey, so you guys wanna go to the Tea Party thingy?"
01:07:31.005,01:07:32.465,-You wanna do that? -Mmm.
01:07:32.965,01:07:34.467,-Mmm. -No?
01:07:34.550,01:07:37.803,"After 15 minutes, I heard they throw the tea in the water, which could be cool."
01:07:37.887,01:07:40.097,-Mmm. -Yeah. I'm super ambivalent too.
01:07:40.181,01:07:41.015,Mmm.
01:07:41.098,01:07:45.061,I do hear there's a cool spiders exhibit in this kids' museum.
01:07:45.144,01:07:45.978,Wanna do that?
01:07:49.440,01:07:51.567,"Okay, how about we wing it?"
01:07:54.445,01:07:59.283,This is nice. You guys are-- -Right? This is cool. Maybe it's too soon. -Look at that over there!
01:08:09.919,01:08:10.753,Ah.
01:08:11.837,01:08:13.047,Hold on. Ah.
01:08:13.130,01:08:15.925,-Yes! -Whoa! Whoa!
01:08:18.427,01:08:20.679,You ready? Hit 'em with a wave. There you go.
01:08:20.763,01:08:23.349,See that? See how cool that is?
01:08:23.432,01:08:24.266,Yeah.
01:08:24.350,01:08:27.478,I used to play with these ducks when I was little!
01:08:29.980,01:08:30.898,"Hi, Bella."
01:08:32.691,01:08:33.776,…and that was your favorite.
01:08:33.859,01:08:35.611,"-Duck, duck, duck, duck… -Oh my goodness."
01:08:35.694,01:08:37.613,"-…duck, duck, duck, duck… -Oh, my-- Ow."
01:08:37.696,01:08:39.031,"…duck, duck, duck, goose!"
01:08:39.115,01:08:41.117,Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
01:08:43.869,01:08:44.912,Let me do a solo.
01:08:48.624,01:08:50.459,"Solo, yes!"
01:08:56.382,01:08:58.634,Hmm. Purple and black.
01:09:04.306,01:09:07.393,"you could, like, add some fire or something."
01:09:10.020,01:09:10.855,"Oh, wow."
01:09:14.400,01:09:17.862,"-You like it? -Yeah. No, this is, uh… this is somethin'."
01:09:17.945,01:09:19.697,"Maddy, I don't know if we can keep this goin'."
01:09:19.780,01:09:20.823,Why not?
01:09:20.906,01:09:23.409,"Well, because they're… they're walls."
01:09:23.492,01:09:26.036,Our house isn't the house for this.
01:09:26.120,01:09:31.625,"Grandma… Grandma's house, those walls are the walls you wanna write on because all her walls are white."
01:09:32.209,01:09:33.669,Are you visiting your grandma soon?
01:09:41.010,01:09:43.137,-Is she gonna stay here? -Not tonight.
01:09:43.679,01:09:46.098,"She wanted to come in and tell you good night though, okay?"
01:09:46.182,01:09:47.016,Yeah?
01:09:47.099,01:09:47.933,Swan?
01:09:50.728,01:09:51.979,"Hey, Maddy."
01:09:52.062,01:09:54.690,So I had a blast today. Did you have fun?
01:09:54.773,01:09:55.608,-Yeah. -Good.
01:09:55.691,01:09:58.861,Is she gonna sleep in your bed when she does sleep here?
01:10:02.948,01:10:05.367,"-No, I think that's… that's disgusting. -Ick."
01:10:07.786,01:10:09.455,She'll sleep in the bathtub.
01:10:10.289,01:10:11.832,You can borrow a pillow if you want.
01:10:11.916,01:10:14.543,That is so nice. That'll make it more comfortable.
01:10:14.627,01:10:16.128,-So generous. -Yeah.
01:10:18.380,01:10:21.175,"-'Night, Maddy. -Good night. Get some rest."
01:10:34.480,01:10:35.314,I love you.
01:10:35.940,01:10:37.191,Get some sleep.
01:10:46.992,01:10:51.247,"-You okay? -Um, no, I just forgot somethin'."
01:10:51.330,01:10:52.998,I'm a little upset at myself.
01:10:53.082,01:10:56.293,"Um, thank you. You were great with her today."
01:11:03.926,01:11:08.931,Maybe you could come over to my place in the morning after dropping Maddy off?
01:11:09.848,01:11:12.476,You might get a little lucky if you bring me a latte.
01:11:13.978,01:11:14.895,Okay.
01:11:18.399,01:11:19.900,-Mr. Logelin. -I gotta get out of here.
01:11:42.214,01:11:44.800,Rules? We don't need no stinkin' rules.
01:11:44.883,01:11:46.343,That's what my dad says.
01:11:46.427,01:11:53.267,"Okay. Well, your daddy signed a paper when you were first accepted at this school, and he agreed to follow the rules."
01:11:55.352,01:11:59.773,Sister Kathleen would like you to follow the rules and wear this skirt starting today.
01:12:19.335,01:12:20.502,Are those boys' underwear?
01:12:21.337,01:12:23.339,"Maddy wears boys' underwear. Everyone, look."
01:12:23.422,01:12:25.716,"-Maddy wears boys' underwear. -Look, boys' underwear!"
01:12:29.219,01:12:31.555,"-You zip it. -I'm warning you, Darren."
01:12:31.638,01:12:33.098,-Boys' underwear! -Boys' underwear!
01:12:33.182,01:12:34.141,Cannonball!
01:13:00.334,01:13:01.210,Where's Daddy?
01:13:01.710,01:13:03.504,We're still trying to reach him.
01:13:20.437,01:13:21.480,Maddy Logelin?
01:13:22.022,01:13:22.940,Thank you.
01:13:27.403,01:13:30.114,"Hey. Oh my God, Maddy."
01:13:33.033,01:13:34.410,"Oh, let me see. Let me see."
01:13:34.493,01:13:36.578,"-Mr. Logelin, I-- -Please, please."
01:13:37.371,01:13:38.497,"How you doin', huh?"
01:13:39.373,01:13:40.374,"I'm sorry, Daddy."
01:13:40.457,01:13:41.458,What?
01:13:41.542,01:13:43.043,You're sorry? No.
01:13:43.127,01:13:46.380,"You don't… you don't have to be sorry. Dad, Daddy's sorry."
01:13:46.463,01:13:48.215,"Okay, come on. We're leavin'."
01:13:48.298,01:13:50.300,"-Sir, sir, sir, wait. -No!"
01:13:52.845,01:13:53.929,Listen to me.
01:13:54.012,01:13:56.974,We're not doin' anything here because you don't know how to do nothin' right.
01:13:57.057,01:13:59.393,"I've been here. No, thank you. Come on."
01:13:59.476,01:14:02.479,I know she's gonna have a substantial scar if she doesn't get stitches.
01:14:13.157,01:14:14.158,Look at me.
01:14:16.160,01:14:17.244,You're so strong.
01:14:18.495,01:14:21.290,Such a strong little girl. Okay?
01:14:22.291,01:14:23.125,I'm proud.
01:14:23.917,01:14:25.127,Guess who else is proud?
01:14:26.170,01:14:28.088,Mommy. Mommy would be proud right now.
01:14:29.256,01:14:31.008,"We're gonna go get some stitches, okay?"
01:14:32.217,01:14:33.635,"Squeeze my hand, that's all."
01:14:34.761,01:14:35.596,There you go.
01:14:38.807,01:14:40.893,"Mm-hmm-hmm. Good job, Maddy."
01:14:43.479,01:14:44.521,You're doin' good.
01:14:47.858,01:14:49.276,-Hey. -Hey.
01:14:49.359,01:14:51.195,I've been calling. Is she all right?
01:14:52.154,01:14:56.200,"Yeah, um… Sorry I didn't pick up."
01:14:56.283,01:14:59.578,"I'm just, uh, a little upset because I feel like I should've been there sooner."
01:15:02.831,01:15:03.749,I actually can.
01:15:04.875,01:15:07.461,I can blame myself because I wasn't there.
01:15:07.544,01:15:09.922,Anything could've happened to her. She could've lost her eye.
01:15:10.005,01:15:10.964,She didn't.
01:15:15.761,01:15:20.057,"Can I, um… can I see her? I brought her this guy."
01:15:22.100,01:15:22.976,It's very sweet.
01:15:24.478,01:15:25.979,I think she's sleeping though.
01:15:28.815,01:15:31.527,"I just think that, right now, she's not ready."
01:15:34.238,01:15:39.451,"-Ready for what? -For this. She's not ready for this, this."
01:15:39.535,01:15:41.119,"She's not ready, or you're not ready?"
01:15:41.203,01:15:48.669,"Look, Swan, the hospital that I was at today, it's the same hospital that Liz died in."
01:15:49.419,01:15:53.632,"I mean, thank God, thank God today I got there in time to hold her hand."
01:15:55.092,01:16:00.889,"Because with Liz, it was different. With Liz, I didn't get to hold her hand. I got shoved out the room."
01:16:02.558,01:16:07.646,"I got shoved out the room, and when I came back, she was gone."
01:16:10.107,01:16:13.902,"She was gone, and there was a little… there was a tube stickin' out of her mouth."
01:16:24.746,01:16:25.747,That's the problem.
01:16:26.540,01:16:29.585,It did not happen to me.
01:16:31.587,01:16:32.754,Don't be sorry for me.
01:16:33.255,01:16:37.217,"Okay, I'm, um, um… I'm, um… I'm gonna go."
01:16:38.468,01:16:40.304,Would you give Maddy my love please?
01:16:53.692,01:16:55.068,What's going on? What's wrong?
01:17:04.077,01:17:05.996,Do you think it came off on the playground?
01:17:06.079,01:17:06.913,Maybe.
01:17:10.083,01:17:12.210,It will come up. All right?
01:17:13.879,01:17:16.381,-I need you to go to Croatia. -Croatia?
01:17:16.465,01:17:17.633,"Yeah, just for a month."
01:17:17.716,01:17:19.426,Just set up the office there. That's all.
01:17:19.509,01:17:22.929,Why don't you send Oscar? His wife's Croatian. He speaks Croatian.
01:17:23.013,01:17:24.056,-He does? -Yes.
01:17:24.139,01:17:26.642,"Yeah, I don't care. I'm gonna send you. I trust you."
01:17:26.725,01:17:29.102,"Howard, that's tough, man. That… that's really tough for me."
01:17:29.186,01:17:32.064,I don't know if I can leave Maddy for over a month. I can't do that.
01:17:32.147,01:17:35.025,It's an opportunity. College tuition's not gettin' any cheaper.
01:17:35.108,01:17:37.110,College tuition? I'm trying to get through the week.
01:17:37.194,01:17:40.405,"Yeah, well, hey, that's how it happens. Think about it."
01:17:40.989,01:17:49.665,"I don't need to… Yeah, I mean, I should be traveling for work right now."
01:17:49.748,01:17:52.793,I just don't… I don't know if I wanna leave her with a friend for that long.
01:17:52.876,01:17:55.295,And this is just the beginnin' travel-wise.
01:17:55.379,01:17:57.756,Welcome to not knowing the right thing to do.
01:17:58.256,01:17:59.716,That's a dad specialty.
01:18:00.425,01:18:01.259,Hmm.
01:18:06.390,01:18:08.183,Is Swan coming to Minnesota?
01:18:09.726,01:18:13.480,Uh… I don't think we're gonna be seeing much of Swan anymore.
01:18:13.563,01:18:14.898,Why not?
01:18:14.981,01:18:17.317,Because Swan and I broke up.
01:18:17.401,01:18:19.945,What? You didn't talk to me about that!
01:18:20.028,01:18:22.739,I did not talk to you about it because I don't need your permission.
01:18:22.823,01:18:24.616,Call her and say you're still going out.
01:18:24.700,01:18:26.076,No. It doesn't work like that.
01:18:26.159,01:18:27.119,So make it work.
01:18:27.202,01:18:30.247,Stop. You're pushin' it. I don't even know why you're actin' like you care.
01:18:30.330,01:18:31.873,You didn't even wanna meet her.
01:18:34.543,01:18:37.379,"-Other people have more people. -What are you talking about, Maddy?"
01:18:37.462,01:18:38.797,It's always just us.
01:18:38.880,01:18:40.757,"Oh, I'm sorry for being your dad."
01:18:40.841,01:18:42.884,I'm sorry for bein' around. Is that what you want?
01:18:43.385,01:18:44.886,It's not even just us all the time.
01:18:44.970,01:18:47.931,You got Jordan. You got Oscar. You got Poker Sundays.
01:18:48.014,01:18:50.350,Swan's not at Poker Sunday.
01:18:50.434,01:18:52.144,Because Swan does not play poker.
01:18:52.227,01:18:53.186,I don't care!
01:18:53.270,01:18:57.232,"I like her, and I like my grandmas and Grandpa Mike. And we never see them!"
01:18:57.315,01:18:59.443,"Okay, what are you talkin' about? Where are we goin'?"
01:18:59.526,01:19:02.988,"How come, when something good happens, it always gets taken away?"
01:19:05.782,01:19:07.451,I don't have an answer for that.
01:19:07.534,01:19:10.078,And I don't have an answer for anything else you wanna ask me.
01:19:10.162,01:19:11.538,Don't ask me no more questions.
01:19:11.621,01:19:15.459,"For the rest of the day, for the whole flight, I'm not answerin' nothin' else that you ask me."
01:19:15.542,01:19:17.794,Do you hear me? Question time is over.
01:19:17.878,01:19:20.172,"I give you an inch, you take a mile. Carry your bag."
01:19:20.255,01:19:27.137,"-Uh! -What? Who you uh-ing? Who-- Hey, stop stompin', I'll tell you that much."
01:19:27.220,01:19:31.933,"We are going to have so much fun. Your cousins are waiting for you, Maddy."
01:19:44.237,01:19:51.953,"I like to unpack, because I don't like things to be all in a jumble in my luggage, and I can't find anything."
01:19:54.247,01:19:55.874,I lost Mommy's necklace.
01:19:55.957,01:19:58.502,Yeah. Your daddy told me.
01:19:59.711,01:20:01.588,Why don't I buy you another necklace?
01:20:01.671,01:20:03.548,It won't be the one Daddy bought Mommy.
01:20:04.299,01:20:06.718,That's true. That's true.
01:20:08.512,01:20:09.554,What was she like?
01:20:13.517,01:20:17.646,Your mom was the best!
01:20:23.109,01:20:25.612,"You… you know, you remind me a lot of her."
01:20:26.488,01:20:29.616,"Hey, should we take a little Mommy tour around the neighborhood?"
01:20:29.699,01:20:31.618,-Yeah. -Just the two of us. Come on.
01:20:31.701,01:20:34.996,"That's where your mommy's best friend, Anastacia, lived."
01:20:35.080,01:20:41.586,"Stacy. There's a creek behind their house, and they used to go off in there, diggin' up tadpoles."
01:20:42.587,01:20:47.342,And they would bring all of that smelly mess and mud into my kitchen.
01:20:47.425,01:20:53.890,"And then, every Saturday morning, this is where your mom would come and play soccer!"
01:21:19.791,01:21:23.670,"Hey, um, is Liz's room permanently set up for Maddy now?"
01:21:23.753,01:21:24.796,"Yes, yes."
01:21:25.922,01:21:27.841,-Is that problematic? -I think it's confusin'.
01:21:28.717,01:21:31.469,"With all she's been through, the accident and everything else."
01:21:31.553,01:21:33.597,"Well, it wasn't exactly an accident."
01:21:34.472,01:21:35.682,What is that supposed to mean?
01:21:35.765,01:21:41.313,If you had followed the rules the school asked you to follow instead of encouragin' her to act out.
01:21:41.396,01:21:42.647,You don't think I know that?
01:21:43.440,01:21:45.609,You don't think I blame myself for what happened?
01:21:45.692,01:21:48.278,"You don't really expect me to argue that, do you?"
01:21:51.448,01:21:53.575,"-We are all trying. -No, we're not."
01:21:53.658,01:21:58.580,-We have nothing in common outside of Liz. -We have-- -Nothing in common! -We have Maddy.
01:21:58.663,01:22:02.542,"Mike, I apologize to you. I'm not stayin' here. I'm not."
01:22:07.172,01:22:10.258,I think you both sorta have a thing or two in common.
01:22:15.388,01:22:17.974,We're leavin'. We're goin' over to Grandma Anna's.
01:22:18.058,01:22:20.018,I don't wanna leave! I wanna stay here!
01:22:20.101,01:22:23.855,"Hey, hey. Don't start with me, Maddy. All right? It's just for a little bit."
01:22:24.439,01:22:25.774,You never listen to me.
01:22:29.694,01:22:31.821,I wanna live here with Grammy and Granddad.
01:22:31.905,01:22:33.823,Why can't we both stay here?
01:22:33.907,01:22:35.283,I don't wanna go back.
01:22:36.493,01:22:40.497,"I don't wanna go to St. Joseph, even if Mommy wanted me to wear a uniform."
01:22:53.927,01:22:55.929,Mommy would have wanted you to be happy.
01:22:59.057,01:23:01.685,That's what Mommy would have wanted. Come here.
01:23:33.633,01:23:34.676,Happy.
01:23:36.970,01:23:39.097,She seems really happy over there.
01:23:41.182,01:23:42.934,-You know what I was thinkin' about? -Hmm?
01:23:43.018,01:23:47.105,That time when I asked Dad could I go live with him 'cause you wouldn't let me do what I wanted to.
01:23:47.188,01:23:52.652,"I certainly remember. He brought you right back here, all across town."
01:23:54.237,01:23:55.071,He knew.
01:23:56.281,01:23:59.034,It's probably the least selfish thing he ever did.
01:24:17.635,01:24:19.220,"One, two, three."
01:24:25.685,01:24:28.480,"Okay, everybody, who wants cake?"
01:24:37.739,01:24:48.833,I made a deal with you when… when you were a baby to… always try and do what was best for you.
01:24:50.877,01:24:53.505,"And right now, I can't. I can't move here."
01:24:56.132,01:25:00.220,"You know, but that shouldn't mean that you… that you can't."
01:25:03.223,01:25:09.604,"You know, Grandma Marion and Grandpa Mike, they brought up Mommy."
01:25:11.231,01:25:12.524,And Mommy was the best.
01:25:12.607,01:25:13.942,She was just like you.
01:25:15.819,01:25:25.161,"You know, um… You and your mom are the best thing that ever happened to me."
01:25:36.047,01:25:42.220,I wanna… I wanna thank you… for taking care of me.
01:25:46.558,01:25:53.898,"I want you to know that I tried, but… I know that you're happy here."
01:25:56.025,01:25:59.028,I just wanna do what your mom would have wanted me to do.
01:26:03.199,01:26:04.033,Two kisses.
01:26:23.219,01:26:24.470,This is gonna be fun.
01:26:26.347,01:26:27.891,"It's gonna be so much fun, you know."
01:26:27.974,01:26:30.935,You get to… you get to spend time with Grandma and Grandpa.
01:26:32.687,01:26:33.605,You'll be back?
01:26:33.688,01:26:36.774,"Yeah, yes. Of course, I'll be back."
01:26:36.858,01:26:45.575,"You know, Dad's just gotta go, gotta go to work and, you know, take care of some stuff. And I don't… I don't wanna be selfish."
01:26:46.326,01:26:49.537,I want you to spend time with… with your family here.
01:26:50.455,01:26:53.708,All right? It'll be great. This will be… this will be good.
01:26:54.834,01:26:55.668,Okay?
01:26:56.419,01:26:57.503,"All right, give me a hug."
01:26:58.338,01:26:59.214,Mmm.
01:28:12.203,01:28:23.464,"Look, Matt, um, now, I know you don't really wanna hear this, but, like, honestly, none of us thought you would've did the job you did."
01:28:23.548,01:28:24.382,Hmm.
01:28:26.384,01:28:28.261,of taking care of this little girl by yourself.
01:28:28.344,01:28:33.016,"Honestly, you did a way better job than any of us thought you would do, man."
01:28:33.099,01:28:35.810,"You should be proud of yourself, man. You did that."
01:28:42.442,01:28:44.986,"Put Pampers on her, gave her some clothes."
01:28:46.279,01:28:47.113,Yeah.
01:28:48.573,01:28:49.782,"Yeah, that's a good job."
01:28:50.658,01:28:55.830,"I mean, what I did, you gotta say, it was probably the bare minimum of parenting."
01:28:55.913,01:28:57.498,"That should be enough, right?"
01:28:57.582,01:28:59.167,I think you're being hard on yourself.
01:29:02.962,01:29:05.256,Nobody else thought that I could raise my child.
01:29:05.882,01:29:06.716,"So, why did I?"
01:29:10.094,01:29:14.849,"What am I doin'? What decision am I making, and who's the decision best for? 'Cause I don't know."
01:29:16.351,01:29:17.226,Cheers.
01:29:24.984,01:29:26.903,"Matt, come on in."
01:29:26.986,01:29:29.447,Close the door. Grab a chair.
01:29:29.530,01:29:30.448,"Yes, sir."
01:29:30.531,01:29:33.493,I got… got some bad news.
01:29:33.576,01:29:34.744,Bad news?
01:29:35.411,01:29:36.746,I'm leavin'.
01:29:38.247,01:29:41.501,"I'm leaving the office. I'm, uh, moving up that chain."
01:29:41.584,01:29:44.796,And I've recommended you to take over my job.
01:29:46.631,01:29:49.300,"Yeah, I… I figured now you got more time to focus."
01:29:49.384,01:29:52.011,You can travel more for work. I think you're ready.
01:29:53.179,01:29:59.310,This could… this could be yours. Also throwin' in… a new salary.
01:30:02.647,01:30:04.315,"It says, Buy dog food."
01:30:04.399,01:30:05.274,Turn it over.
01:30:09.779,01:30:10.613,Wow.
01:30:11.197,01:30:14.826,"-There's your college tuition. -I mean, I… I don't know what to say."
01:30:14.909,01:30:16.702,You know what? You deserve it.
01:30:16.786,01:30:17.662,Thank you.
01:30:21.916,01:30:24.710,"I don't know why, I've always felt sorta like a father figure to you."
01:30:24.794,01:30:28.589,"-Hmm? -Not a father, but, you know, like a… an uncle maybe or a cousin."
01:30:28.673,01:30:31.509,Kinda like a… a… a big brother.
01:30:32.844,01:30:34.846,Neighbor? Maybe I felt like a neighbor.
01:30:34.929,01:30:36.806,"-Big… bigger, older neighbor. -Got ya."
01:30:36.889,01:30:39.892,And I don't wanna get all sappy. I'm not gonna get all sappy.
01:30:39.976,01:30:47.733,You don't have to really get into-- I'm very glad I didn't fire you.
01:30:48.901,01:30:53.156,"I'm, um… I'm glad too."
01:30:55.366,01:30:56.284,You're a good man.
01:31:07.795,01:31:08.671,What is that?
01:31:12.258,01:31:14.218,Am I the only one that feel like this?
01:31:14.302,01:31:16.387,Does it feel weird that Maddy's not here?
01:31:19.474,01:31:22.101,"We usually, like, play with, you know… -Cookies. Yeah. -…cookies."
01:31:22.185,01:31:24.353,"Cookies. I mean, the chips, you know, that's cool too."
01:31:24.437,01:31:28.316,"You know, cash game, but do you have any, uh… you know, do you have any cookies?"
01:31:28.399,01:31:29.942,You want cookies? Is that what you want?
01:31:30.026,01:31:31.944,-We'll take some cookies. -Cookies would be great.
01:31:32.028,01:31:33.821,"Tell you what, I'mma bring the cookie out here."
01:31:33.905,01:31:35.406,Y'all better eat every damn cookie.
01:31:35.490,01:31:36.449,-Okay. -You hear me?
01:31:36.532,01:31:38.701,-Yes. -You better eat every damn cookie.
01:31:38.784,01:31:40.786,Or else it's gonna be a problem out here.
01:31:41.287,01:31:44.040,Let it be a cookie left after I bring these cookies out.
01:31:44.624,01:31:47.543,"I mean, all he had to do is say he miss her too, you know."
01:33:44.619,01:33:45.953,but they do have Brazil nuts.
01:33:46.454,01:33:49.957,"Dude, thanks so much for taking me on this trip. Seriously."
01:33:50.666,01:33:51.792,So psyched to be wingman.
01:33:52.460,01:33:54.754,"Yeah, well, my Croatian's a little rusty, man."
01:33:55.338,01:33:57.840,"-Teach me some stuff. -Yeah, for sure. Okay."
01:33:58.424,01:34:01.052,"Uh, repeat after me. Začepi."
01:34:02.094,01:34:03.846,-Začepi. -Začepi.
01:34:03.929,01:34:06.098,"-What does that mean? -It means, Be quiet."
01:34:06.682,01:34:08.267,-Be quiet? -Začepi.
01:34:09.352,01:34:10.936,Why would I… why would I wanna learn that?
01:34:14.857,01:34:16.359,-Začepi? -Yeah.
01:34:16.442,01:34:19.070,"My wife says that all the time. You know, Začepi."
01:34:19.153,01:34:20.029,You know?
01:34:20.571,01:34:24.950,Look. Look at the duck. Look at the ducky. Look at the ducky.
01:34:25.743,01:34:26.952,Look at the duck.
01:34:28.954,01:34:30.206,Look at the ducks.
01:34:31.123,01:34:32.792,"Oh, yeah."
01:34:35.586,01:34:36.420,Huh?
01:34:37.129,01:34:38.255,You like that duck?
01:34:39.423,01:34:41.550,No? Come on. Let's see the next one.
01:34:42.968,01:34:44.679,"Ooh, ooh. What about this duck?"
01:34:45.179,01:34:46.263,You like that duck?
01:34:47.390,01:34:48.808,No? All right.
01:34:48.891,01:34:50.393,This one was my favorite.
01:34:50.476,01:34:54.105,-She says that one was her favorite. -Because it always looks at the sun.
01:35:01.278,01:35:02.863,"No, I'm not nervous."
01:35:03.489,01:35:04.323,Yeah.
01:35:04.949,01:35:07.451,Yeah. I can do anything.
01:35:14.542,01:35:17.294,Maddy. Hey. Hey.
01:35:17.378,01:35:19.130,"Come here. You can do it, Maddy."
01:35:20.840,01:35:21.757,Jordan! Jordan!
01:35:22.508,01:35:23.426,"Come on, Maddy!"
01:35:30.808,01:35:31.976,Oh my gosh.
01:35:32.560,01:35:34.520,Hey! Jordan!
01:35:36.731,01:35:37.773,Jordan! She walkin'!
01:35:46.991,01:35:48.492,Ready for your first day?
01:35:48.576,01:35:51.620,This is gonna be kinda tough because she's never been around anybody but me.
01:35:51.704,01:35:54.540,So there's probably gonna be separation issues. But you're a big girl.
01:35:58.961,01:35:59.795,Mmm.
01:36:00.838,01:36:01.672,Mmm.
01:36:03.716,01:36:06.177,Maddy. Maddy.
01:36:07.428,01:36:09.054,I'll just hang out to watch a little bit.
01:36:09.138,01:36:10.681,-Sure. No problem. -Okay?
01:36:14.477,01:36:17.605,"Oh, do you want to, um, talk or sleep, you know, on the flight?"
01:36:18.314,01:36:21.066,"I tend to do both, actually. Talk in my sleep."
01:36:21.150,01:36:26.655,"Um, so if I do, just, you know, kind of nudge me awake, or you can probably even talk to me, actually."
01:36:26.739,01:36:28.908,I'm pretty interesting when I'm sleep-talking.
01:36:28.991,01:36:29.992,I believe in you.
01:36:32.036,01:36:34.455,"Thanks, man. I mean, that's really sweet."
01:36:34.538,01:36:35.790,I… I believe in you too.
01:36:36.582,01:36:39.502,-Matt? -I really believe in you.
01:36:39.585,01:36:41.670,"Uh, the gate's actually that way. Matt?"
01:36:41.754,01:36:42.797,Začepi!
01:36:44.673,01:36:45.508,Got it.
01:37:01.982,01:37:02.817,Hey.
01:37:03.609,01:37:04.443,Hey.
01:37:13.410,01:37:17.665,-I didn't know you were coming today! -Oh! I surprised you!
01:37:17.748,01:37:20.209,-Oh! Guess what? -What?
01:37:20.292,01:37:21.627,Look what I found.
01:37:23.712,01:37:28.843,"I found it and said, I gotta get on a plane and fly all the way here to give it to you myself in person. Come here."
01:37:30.135,01:37:31.053,Let me see.
01:37:33.722,01:37:34.974,So let's go home.
01:37:37.059,01:37:37.893,Don't cry.
01:37:37.977,01:37:39.144,I'm not gonna cry.
01:37:39.812,01:37:41.939,"Wherever you are, I wanna go there."
01:37:43.774,01:37:45.734,"Wherever you are, I wanna go there too."
01:37:46.735,01:37:47.903,Give me a hug.
01:37:55.494,01:37:57.371,"I'll see you back here at Christmastime, okay?"
01:37:57.454,01:37:58.289,Okay.
01:37:58.789,01:38:02.293,"Come on, Maddy. Come on. Right here. There you go."
01:38:04.920,01:38:06.505,"I just wanna say thank you, Marion."
01:38:07.798,01:38:11.552,"For… understanding, you know?"
01:38:18.976,01:38:23.105,"But I know… I know that she would be so proud of you, Matt."
01:38:24.189,01:38:31.906,"You know, she said you were the one when you showed up with those little grocery store flowers."
01:38:31.989,01:38:34.658,"You had 'em gripped so tight, you crushed the stems."
01:38:37.077,01:38:40.247,I was… I was nervous as hell.
01:38:40.831,01:38:42.958,I remember that day like it was yesterday.
01:38:44.919,01:38:46.170,It was yesterday.
01:39:05.314,01:39:06.523,Grammy loves you.
01:39:10.444,01:39:12.446,"Okay, put you down, huh? All right."
01:39:12.529,01:39:14.949,Take care of your papa. Travel safe.
01:39:15.032,01:39:16.825,"-See you later, Mike. -Mm-hmm."
01:39:19.787,01:39:20.871,-Dad? -Hmm?
01:39:20.955,01:39:23.958,Are there the schools near us where you don't wear a uniform?
01:39:24.500,01:39:28.003,"Uh, yes, there are, but I'm thinking about sending you straight to college."
01:39:28.087,01:39:30.881,"So, we won't have to worry about that, okay?"
01:40:08.335,01:40:09.169,Hey.
01:40:12.089,01:40:14.341,"We were in the neighborhood, so we figured we'd stop by."
01:40:14.425,01:40:15.342,"No, we weren't."
01:40:15.843,01:40:17.678,"-We were in the neighborhood. -No, we weren't."
01:40:18.679,01:40:19.513,We weren't.
01:40:19.596,01:40:27.104,"We were not in the area. But I stopped, and I… I got some flowers that say, Sorry for being an idiot."
01:40:28.897,01:40:31.942,I wanted to come and bring the flowers by here and give them to you.
01:40:32.026,01:40:34.319,I didn't want you not to be here then leave 'em on the step.
01:40:34.403,01:40:38.741,"Then somebody come by, they steal the flowers, and you never get the flowers. You know--?"
01:40:38.824,01:40:42.745,"You know, there are a lot of flower thieves in this building."
01:40:42.828,01:40:45.247,"-I didn't wanna say nothin', but yeah. -That's really astute."
01:40:46.373,01:40:47.249,Maddy?
01:40:48.292,01:40:50.169,It's so good to see you. How you been?
01:40:50.252,01:40:53.630,-I have a really loose tooth. Look. -Ew.
01:40:54.214,01:40:56.675,"Hey, tooth fairy will visit."
01:41:02.264,01:41:03.599,"So, I'll take those."
01:41:09.146,01:41:10.105,Can you forgive me?
01:41:12.232,01:41:16.236,I… need to talk to Maddy for a second.
01:41:17.696,01:41:18.530,Okay.
01:41:18.614,01:41:22.034,All right. I have a very serious question to ask you.
01:41:23.160,01:41:26.538,What are your favorite flavors of ice cream?
01:41:27.039,01:41:28.373,Hmm.
01:41:28.457,01:41:29.792,Strawberry.
01:41:29.875,01:41:30.959,I like strawberry.
01:41:31.043,01:41:32.377,Vanilla.
01:41:33.170,01:41:34.755,Coffee.
01:41:34.838,01:41:35.964,Hold up. Coffee?
01:41:36.757,01:41:40.094,Seriously? You actually like coffee ice cream?
01:41:41.220,01:41:42.054,Huh.
01:41:42.596,01:41:45.349,"You don't like actual coffee, do you?"
01:41:45.432,01:41:46.850,"No, that's gross."
01:41:46.934,01:41:48.852,"Okay. Good. Yes, that's gross."
01:41:48.936,01:41:52.022,"If he is giving you coffee, will you text me?"
01:41:54.024,01:41:54.858,Deal.
01:41:59.988,01:42:00.823,All right.
01:42:01.323,01:42:03.909,Have we left him waiting long enough?
01:42:03.992,01:42:04.827,Eh.
01:42:07.037,01:42:08.038,I guess.
01:42:08.122,01:42:09.414,"Girl, I guess too."
01:42:10.249,01:42:11.083,Come on.
01:42:13.001,01:42:15.796,Maddy and I are gonna go get some ice cream.
01:42:17.339,01:42:18.340,You wanna third wheel?
01:42:21.885,01:42:23.262,"I mean, yes."
01:42:24.638,01:42:25.597,"Yes, I would."
01:42:31.603,01:42:33.605,-Oh. -Is that your ice cream dance?
01:43:13.937,01:43:17.399,-Are you sure you're okay with this? -I'm okay. I'm not afraid.
01:43:17.482,01:43:18.650,All right.
01:43:18.734,01:43:20.319,"It's only for the rest of the year, okay?"
01:43:20.944,01:43:23.530,"So if you don't like it, then we gonna find somethin' else."
01:43:23.614,01:43:25.282,"But if you're not afraid, then guess what?"
01:43:29.161,01:43:30.245,"Hello, Mr. Logelin."
01:43:32.289,01:43:34.583,"Interesting choice of outfit today, sir."
01:43:34.666,01:43:38.003,"I'm wearing my uniform, and Maddy is wearing pants."
01:43:38.754,01:43:42.174,"You look very nice today, Maddy. And we're changing our dress code."
01:43:50.933,01:43:51.767,"Hey, Maddy."
01:43:53.685,01:43:55.062,I love you this much.
01:44:03.320,01:44:05.489,Uh. Good day.
