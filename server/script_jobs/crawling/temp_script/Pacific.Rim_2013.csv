00:00:49.299,00:00:51.676,Turns out I was looking in the wrong direction.
00:00:52.802,00:00:57.223,When alien life entered our world it was from deep beneath the Pacific Ocean.
00:00:58.016,00:01:00.727,A fissure between two tectonic plates.
00:01:02.020,00:01:04.314,A portal between dimensions.
00:01:05.732,00:01:06.649,The Breach.
00:01:08.151,00:01:12.113,I was 15 when the first Kaiju made land in San Francisco.
00:01:38.640,00:01:46.231,"By the time tanks, jets and missiles took it down six days and 35 miles later, three cities were destroyed."
00:01:48.358,00:01:51.111,Tens of thousands of lives were lost.
00:01:55.657,00:02:00.745,"We mourned our dead, memorialized the attack, and moved on."
00:02:06.042,00:02:11.214,"And then, only six months later, the second attack hit Manila."
00:02:14.050,00:02:17.053,creates a toxic phenomenon named Kaiju Blue.
00:02:19.848,00:02:20.849,And then the fourth.
00:02:21.516,00:02:24.644,"And then we learned, this was not gonna stop."
00:02:25.186,00:02:26.479,This was just the beginning.
00:02:28.565,00:02:30.066,We needed a new weapon.
00:02:30.859,00:02:37.699,The world came together pooling its resources and throwing aside old rivalries for the sake of the greater good.
00:02:39.075,00:02:43.121,"To fight monsters, we created monsters of our own."
00:02:44.706,00:02:46.499,The Jaeger program was born.
00:02:48.710,00:02:50.336,There were setbacks at first.
00:02:50.920,00:02:55.466,The neural load to interface with a Jaeger proved too much for a single pilot.
00:02:56.718,00:02:58.511,A two-pilot system was implemented.
00:02:59.262,00:03:02.473,"Left-hemisphere, right-hemisphere pilot control."
00:03:05.727,00:03:08.021,Jaegers stopping Kaijus everywhere.
00:03:09.480,00:03:11.983,But the Jaegers were only as good as their pilots.
00:03:12.692,00:03:15.028,So Jaeger pilots turned into rock stars.
00:03:15.653,00:03:17.697,Danger turned into propaganda.
00:03:18.531,00:03:20.408,Kaijus into toys.
00:03:23.161,00:03:24.579,We got really good at it.
00:03:25.997,00:03:26.831,Winning.
00:03:31.336,00:03:32.170,Then...
00:03:33.379,00:03:34.672,Then it all changed.
00:03:40.470,00:03:44.307,"Kaiju. Code name, Knifehead. Category 3. 8,700 metric tons."
00:03:47.936,00:03:50.396,"-Hey, come on! We're being deployed. -Great."
00:03:54.734,00:03:57.320,"Kaiju's a Category 3, biggest one yet."
00:03:57.862,00:03:59.989,"Code name, Knifehead."
00:04:00.740,00:04:02.408,-What time is it? -2:00.
00:04:03.159,00:04:03.993,A.M.?
00:04:04.494,00:04:05.328,Yep.
00:04:06.996,00:04:08.915,What do you say? Fifth notch on the belt?
00:04:12.001,00:04:12.835,Time for the drop.
00:04:15.463,00:04:16.881,"-Hey, kid. -Yeah?"
00:04:17.507,00:04:18.508,Don't get cocky.
00:04:22.136,00:04:25.139,you wouldn't have picked my brother Yancy and I for heroes.
00:04:25.932,00:04:26.849,No chance.
00:04:31.271,00:04:32.981,We were never star athletes.
00:04:33.606,00:04:35.191,Never at the head of the class.
00:04:35.900,00:04:38.111,But we could hold our own in a fight.
00:04:38.903,00:04:43.574,"And it turned out we had a unique skill, we were Drift compatible."
00:05:02.885,00:05:06.306,Data relay gel dispersing in circuitry suit.
00:05:36.294,00:05:38.337,"Tendo, what's happening, my man?"
00:05:38.421,00:05:41.007,"How'd that date with Alison go last night, Mr. Choi?"
00:05:41.090,00:05:43.051,"Oh, she loved me. Her boyfriend? Not so much."
00:05:43.509,00:05:45.011,You're gonna get your ass kicked.
00:05:47.889,00:05:49.265,"Engage drop, Mr. Choi."
00:05:52.518,00:05:54.103,Marshal Pentecost on deck.
00:05:54.729,00:05:55.772,Securing the Conn Pod.
00:05:55.855,00:05:56.856,Getting ready to drop.
00:06:04.947,00:06:06.074,Release for drop.
00:06:09.786,00:06:10.787,-Here we go. -Yeah!
00:06:11.412,00:06:12.330,Here we go!
00:06:49.826,00:06:52.745,"Gipsy launch, Bay 6."
00:07:08.386,00:07:10.179,"Rangers, this is Marshal Stacker Pentecost."
00:07:10.263,00:07:11.639,Prepare for neural handshake.
00:07:11.722,00:07:13.099,Starting in 15 seconds.
00:07:14.058,00:07:14.892,Fourteen...
00:07:16.352,00:07:17.186,Thirteen...
00:07:17.562,00:07:20.314,"Twelve, eleven, ten..."
00:07:20.398,00:07:22.066,"Ready to step into my head, kid?"
00:07:22.150,00:07:23.109,"Please, after you."
00:07:26.529,00:07:27.655,Protocol sequence.
00:07:28.364,00:07:31.159,Neural handshake initiated.
00:07:34.412,00:07:35.455,Jaeger tech.
00:07:36.038,00:07:38.958,Based on DARPA jet fighter neural systems.
00:07:40.042,00:07:44.464,"Two pilots, mind-melding through memories with the body of a giant machine."
00:07:45.548,00:07:49.385,"The deeper the bond, the better you fight."
00:08:14.994,00:08:17.955,"Gentlemen, your orders are to hold the miracle mile off Anchorage. Copy?"
00:08:19.165,00:08:21.125,"Sir, there's still a civilian vessel in the Gulf..."
00:08:21.209,00:08:23.461,"Gentlemen, you're protecting a city of two million people."
00:08:23.544,00:08:25.880,You will not risk those lives for a boat that holds ten.
00:08:25.963,00:08:27.048,Am I clear?
00:08:31.969,00:08:33.054,You know what I'm thinking.
00:08:33.137,00:08:34.472,I'm in your brain.
00:08:34.555,00:08:36.307,-I know. -Then let's go fishing.
00:08:37.141,00:08:38.142,Here we go!
00:08:38.559,00:08:40.645,"Come on, bro! Put some muscle to it!"
00:08:56.827,00:08:59.956,You see a hurricane coming you have to get out of the way.
00:09:00.498,00:09:05.086,"But when you're in a Jaeger, suddenly you can fight the hurricane."
00:09:05.878,00:09:06.837,You can win.
00:09:19.392,00:09:20.726,How far to the mainland?
00:09:20.810,00:09:22.520,"Seven miles off Anchorage, sir."
00:09:22.603,00:09:24.522,But we won't even make it past the shallows.
00:09:25.856,00:09:27.608,What about that island three miles east?
00:09:31.487,00:09:32.697,"One mile, sir!"
00:09:33.197,00:09:34.198,It's getting closer.
00:09:43.082,00:09:43.916,Kaiju.
00:09:54.302,00:09:55.261,Turn her around!
00:09:55.344,00:09:56.262,Now!
00:10:41.223,00:10:43.100,-Adjust the torque! -I'm on it.
00:11:25.851,00:11:26.894,Get him. Come on.
00:11:40.408,00:11:42.660,Plasma cannon in the shallow shelves seven miles off the coastal line.
00:11:42.743,00:11:45.538,"-Gipsy, what the hell is going on? -Job's done, sir."
00:11:46.372,00:11:48.582,Lit it up twice. Bagged our fifth kill.
00:11:48.666,00:11:50.543,You disobeyed a direct order!
00:11:50.626,00:11:55.131,"Respectfully, sir, we intercepted a Kaiju and saved everyone on that boat."
00:11:55.214,00:11:56.507,Get back to your post. Now!
00:11:58.259,00:11:59.218,"Yes, sir."
00:11:59.301,00:12:00.428,Kaiju signature rising!
00:12:04.515,00:12:05.516,"That thing's still alive, sir."
00:12:06.642,00:12:08.894,Gipsy! We're still getting a signature!
00:12:10.646,00:12:12.148,That Kaiju is still alive!
00:12:13.315,00:12:15.234,Grab the boat and get out of there.
00:12:16.068,00:12:16.902,You copy?
00:12:17.778,00:12:20.197,Grab the boat and get out of there now!
00:12:46.307,00:12:47.558,"Left arm's gone cold, sir."
00:13:08.787,00:13:09.788,"Raleigh, listen to me!"
00:13:15.211,00:13:16.295,No!
00:13:16.962,00:13:17.796,No!
00:14:11.100,00:14:12.393,"Second discharge fried all the comms, sir."
00:14:12.476,00:14:13.435,I'm not getting any signals.
00:14:18.148,00:14:19.149,"No signatures, sir."
00:14:22.570,00:14:23.487,"What do we do now, sir?"
00:14:31.996,00:14:33.539,"Now, you know what I'd like to find?"
00:14:33.914,00:14:37.126,I'd like to find a whole ship. That's what I'd like to find.
00:14:40.087,00:14:41.964,"Wait! Right there, right there! Dig!"
00:14:44.258,00:14:45.092,"Hey, what is it?"
00:14:46.677,00:14:48.053,It's just an old toy.
00:14:48.888,00:14:50.723,We never find anything good.
00:15:03.027,00:15:04.069,"Oh, my God."
00:15:27.968,00:15:28.802,Stay here!
00:15:55.162,00:15:55.996,Can I help?
00:16:07.007,00:16:07.841,Yancy.
00:16:14.223,00:16:16.058,"Run! Get help, fast!"
00:16:17.267,00:16:19.228,It's gonna be all right.
00:17:07.651,00:17:10.029,They're adapting. Evolving.
00:17:10.654,00:17:12.948,And we're losing Jaegers faster than we can build them.
00:17:14.533,00:17:15.367,Lima.
00:17:15.909,00:17:16.744,Seattle.
00:17:17.745,00:17:18.662,Vladivostok.
00:17:19.872,00:17:22.666,Category 4 Kaijus are now coming through the Breach.
00:17:23.250,00:17:26.837,"I think even you can see, Marshal, this is no longer a sound strategy."
00:17:27.671,00:17:29.548,The frequency of the attacks has increased.
00:17:30.257,00:17:34.136,The Jaegers are not the most viable line of defense any more.
00:17:36.430,00:17:43.729,Those are my rangers that die every time a Jaeger falls last chance.
00:17:46.482,00:17:48.400,"The Jaeger program is dead, Marshal."
00:17:48.776,00:17:52.404,"On the other hand, the coastal wall program is a promising option."
00:17:55.407,00:17:56.241,but it's over.
00:17:57.117,00:18:01.789,"We will authorize you to take all remaining Jaegers to the last battle station, Hong Kong."
00:18:02.581,00:18:06.502,We're prepared to fund you for the next eight months while the coastal wall is completed.
00:18:07.211,00:18:10.130,"After that, you will receive no further support."
00:18:10.214,00:18:11.423,"You have your answer, Marshal."
00:18:17.471,00:18:18.305,It's over?
00:18:22.810,00:18:23.894,"That's all they are, Stacker."
00:18:28.816,00:18:29.650,We don't need them.
00:18:51.713,00:18:55.050,"Ration cards, guys! Come on, come on!"
00:18:55.134,00:18:55.968,Let's go!
00:18:57.511,00:19:00.013,"Now, I got good news and I got bad news, fellas."
00:19:00.722,00:19:03.183,-Which one you wanna hear first? -Bad news!
00:19:05.644,00:19:08.397,Three guys died yesterday working the top of the wall.
00:19:13.235,00:19:15.362,I got three new job openings.
00:19:15.445,00:19:16.530,Top of the wall.
00:19:17.489,00:19:20.325,"Okay, who wants to work? Who wants to eat?"
00:19:21.076,00:19:22.035,Come on!
00:20:05.454,00:20:08.916,where earlier today yet another Kaiju attack took place.
00:20:09.416,00:20:15.172,"The Kaiju, an enormous Category 4 broke through the coastal wall in less than an hour."
00:20:19.384,00:20:22.846,The Wall of Life had been deemed un-breachable by its builders...
00:20:25.974,00:20:29.102,That thing went through the wall like it was nothing.
00:20:29.186,00:20:36.568,"Ironically, it was the recently decommissioned Jaeger, Striker Eureka piloted by Herc and Chuck Hansen that finally took the beast down."
00:21:02.844,00:21:05.013,because of mediocre pilots. It's that simple.
00:21:05.806,00:21:07.808,That's Striker Eureka's tenth kill to date.
00:21:08.267,00:21:09.142,It's a new record.
00:21:09.893,00:21:12.688,"And you're still going to Hong Kong, even at a time like this?"
00:21:25.242,00:21:27.077,the Jaeger that took down the Kaiju.
00:21:37.004,00:21:37.838,Marshal.
00:21:38.505,00:21:39.381,Looking sharp.
00:21:40.132,00:21:41.216,Long time.
00:21:42.050,00:21:43.468,"Five years, four months."
00:21:44.594,00:21:45.804,Can I have a word?
00:21:54.021,00:21:55.772,"Anchorage, Sheldon Point, Nome..."
00:21:57.065,00:21:59.860,"travels with the wall, chasing shifts to make a living."
00:22:00.569,00:22:01.486,What do you want?
00:22:04.364,00:22:07.743,I've spent the last six months activating everything I can get my hands on.
00:22:09.119,00:22:12.080,"There's an old Jaeger, a Mark 3."
00:22:12.581,00:22:14.833,You may know it. It needs a pilot.
00:22:14.916,00:22:16.710,I'm guessing I wasn't your first choice.
00:22:17.919,00:22:19.546,You are my first choice.
00:22:19.629,00:22:21.840,All the other Mark 3 pilots are dead.
00:22:27.971,00:22:28.972,Look...
00:22:31.224,00:22:33.602,I can't have anyone else in my head again.
00:22:35.270,00:22:36.271,I'm done.
00:22:37.564,00:22:39.983,I was still connected to my brother when he died.
00:22:40.817,00:22:43.153,"I can't go through that again, man, I'm sorry."
00:22:44.488,00:22:46.073,"Haven't you heard, Mr. Becket?"
00:22:48.909,00:22:50.786,The world is coming to an end.
00:22:52.079,00:22:53.580,So where would you rather die?
00:22:54.414,00:22:57.375,"Here, or in a Jaeger?"
00:24:06.153,00:24:08.655,"Mr. Becket, this is Mako Mori."
00:24:09.281,00:24:10.240,One of our brightest.
00:24:10.824,00:24:13.118,Also in charge of the Mark 3 restoration program.
00:24:13.869,00:24:16.872,She personally handpicked your co-pilot candidates.
00:24:19.791,00:24:21.418,I imagined him differently.
00:24:22.460,00:24:23.295,Hey.
00:24:24.462,00:24:25.797,Better or worse?
00:24:28.425,00:24:32.053,"I apologize, Mr. Becket. I've heard a lot about you."
00:24:40.145,00:24:43.857,"We will tour the facility first and then Miss Mori will show you to your Jaeger, Mr. Becket."
00:24:45.525,00:24:46.526,Thank you.
00:24:46.610,00:24:48.236,Thank you. Thank you.
00:24:51.406,00:24:55.035,"Stay back. Kaiju specimens are extremely rare, so look but don't touch, please."
00:24:55.118,00:24:57.329,"Mr. Becket, this is our research team."
00:24:57.412,00:24:59.164,Dr. Gottlieb and Dr. Geiszler.
00:24:59.247,00:25:00.332,"Oh, no, call me Newt."
00:25:01.124,00:25:02.584,Only my mother calls me Doctor.
00:25:04.002,00:25:06.254,"Hermann, these are human beings. Why don't you say hello?"
00:25:06.338,00:25:08.882,I have asked you not to refer to me by my first name around others.
00:25:08.965,00:25:16.431,I am a doctor with over ten years of decorated experience-- Who is that? Yamarashi?
00:25:16.556,00:25:19.351,"Oh, this little Kaiju? Yeah, you got a good eye."
00:25:19.809,00:25:22.520,My brother and I took him down in 2017.
00:25:22.604,00:25:24.731,You know he was one of the biggest Category 3s ever?
00:25:24.814,00:25:27.275,"He was 2,500 tons of awesome."
00:25:32.447,00:25:33.865,"Or awful. You know, whatever you wanna call it."
00:25:33.949,00:25:36.618,Please excuse him. He's a Kaiju groupie. He loves them.
00:25:36.701,00:25:38.536,"Shut up, Hermann, I don't love them, okay?"
00:25:38.620,00:25:39.663,I study them.
00:25:39.746,00:25:42.749,"And unlike most people, I wanna see one alive and up close one day."
00:25:45.085,00:25:47.045,"Trust me, you don't want to."
00:25:50.298,00:25:52.050,So that's your Research Division?
00:25:56.930,00:25:58.640,"We're not an army any more, Mr. Becket."
00:26:00.058,00:26:01.351,We're the resistance.
00:26:02.852,00:26:04.104,Welcome to the Shatterdome.
00:26:23.623,00:26:24.791,War clock.
00:26:24.874,00:26:27.002,We reset it after every Kaiju attack.
00:26:27.085,00:26:28.753,Keeps everyone focused.
00:26:28.837,00:26:30.672,The frequency of attacks is accelerating.
00:26:30.755,00:26:32.257,How long till the next reset?
00:26:35.468,00:26:38.430,My experts believe there'll be a Kaiju attack even before that.
00:26:39.180,00:26:42.976,This complex used to lodge 30 Jaegers in five bays just like this one.
00:26:45.520,00:26:47.314,Now we only have four Jaegers left.
00:26:49.024,00:26:50.608,I didn't know it was this bad.
00:26:50.734,00:26:51.693,It is that bad.
00:26:52.569,00:26:55.447,"Crimson Typhoon, China. One of the greatest."
00:26:55.864,00:26:59.451,"Assembled in Changzhou. Full titanium core, no alloys."
00:26:59.534,00:27:01.703,Fifty diesel engines per muscle strand.
00:27:01.786,00:27:03.163,"Deadly, precise fighter."
00:27:03.830,00:27:05.999,She's piloted by the Wei Tang brothers.
00:27:06.082,00:27:07.834,Triplets. Local lads.
00:27:08.710,00:27:11.880,They've successfully defended Hong Kong port seven times.
00:27:11.963,00:27:13.590,They use the Thundercloud formation.
00:27:22.098,00:27:25.310,"That tank, last of the T-90s. Cherno Alpha."
00:27:25.393,00:27:26.895,First generation Mark 1.
00:27:27.312,00:27:29.230,The heaviest and oldest Jaeger in the service.
00:27:29.314,00:27:32.817,"But make no mistake, Mr. Becket, it's a brutal war machine."
00:27:32.901,00:27:35.653,"And those two, Sasha and Aleksis Kaidanovsky."
00:27:35.737,00:27:39.115,"Yeah, I've heard of them. Perimeter patrol, Siberian wall."
00:27:42.494,00:27:44.120,Six years.
00:28:01.679,00:28:03.515,"Gentlemen, welcome to Hong Kong!"
00:28:11.564,00:28:13.691,Sees a pretty girl and he gets all wound up.
00:28:16.069,00:28:17.821,an old friend from the Mark 1 glory days.
00:28:17.904,00:28:19.447,"I know you, mate. We rode together before."
00:28:19.531,00:28:21.825,"We did, sir. Six years ago. My brother and I."
00:28:24.119,00:28:25.120,Sorry about your brother.
00:28:26.121,00:28:26.955,"Thank you, sir."
00:28:27.622,00:28:30.375,Herc and his son Chuck'll be running point using Striker Eureka.
00:28:31.042,00:28:32.252,Fastest Jaeger in the world.
00:28:32.794,00:28:34.587,First and last of the Mark 5s.
00:28:35.046,00:28:37.966,Australia decommissioned it a day before the Sydney attack.
00:28:43.096,00:28:44.764,You haven't told me what I'm doing here yet.
00:28:46.474,00:28:47.851,"We're going for the Breach, Mr. Becket."
00:28:48.309,00:28:51.813,"We're gonna strap a 2,400 pound thermonuclear warhead to Striker's back."
00:28:52.772,00:28:56.234,Detonate an equivalent of 1.2 million tons of TNT.
00:28:56.317,00:28:59.070,And you and two other Jaegers will be running defense for them.
00:29:01.197,00:29:02.490,Where'd you get something that big?
00:29:03.116,00:29:05.744,See the Russians back there? They can get us anything.
00:29:06.745,00:29:07.704,"Herc, shall we?"
00:29:07.787,00:29:09.289,"-Good to have you back. -Thank you, sir."
00:29:09.914,00:29:12.167,-I'll show you to your Jaeger now. -Miss Mori...
00:29:13.543,00:29:14.586,Will you give me a minute?
00:29:16.212,00:29:17.046,Marshal!
00:29:18.590,00:29:21.760,"Sir, we've hit the Breach before. It doesn't work. Nothing goes through."
00:29:22.260,00:29:23.094,What's changed?
00:29:23.845,00:29:26.556,I've got a plan. I need you ready. That's all.
00:29:27.348,00:29:28.391,"Let's go, Herc!"
00:29:37.484,00:29:39.152,Zero minus two.
00:29:39.235,00:29:42.447,XY minus two. R-E-Q...
00:29:42.530,00:29:45.366,"In the beginning, the Kaiju attacks were spaced by 24 weeks."
00:29:45.450,00:29:48.286,"Then twelve, then six, then every two weeks."
00:29:49.871,00:29:51.581,The last one in Sydney was a week.
00:29:52.624,00:29:57.128,In four days we could be seeing a Kaiju every eight hours until they are coming every four minutes.
00:29:57.212,00:30:00.423,"Marshal, we should witness a double event within seven days."
00:30:01.174,00:30:07.430,"Mr. Gottlieb, I'm to drop a 2,400 pound thermonuclear bomb, I need more than a prediction."
00:30:07.514,00:30:13.019,"Well, uh, that's a problem then, because see, he actually can't give you anything more than a prediction."
00:30:13.102,00:30:16.231,No Kaiju entrails over my side of the room. You know the rules.
00:30:16.314,00:30:19.067,-Every bloody day. It's incessant. -Gents! On point.
00:30:20.401,00:30:21.486,Numbers do not lie.
00:30:22.320,00:30:24.948,"Politics and poetry, promises, these are lies."
00:30:25.490,00:30:28.660,Numbers are as close as we get to the handwriting of God.
00:30:28.743,00:30:30.537,-What? -Would you give me a moment?
00:30:31.496,00:30:32.747,There will be a double event.
00:30:33.373,00:30:35.041,"And then, shortly thereafter, three."
00:30:39.838,00:30:41.506,This is where the good news comes.
00:30:43.800,00:30:50.348,"Here is our universe, and here is theirs."
00:30:50.974,00:30:53.852,"And this is what we call The Throat, the passage between the Breach and us."
00:30:53.935,00:30:55.603,We know that it's atomic in nature.
00:30:55.687,00:31:07.782,I predict that the increased traffic will force the Breach to stabilize and remain open long enough to get the device through and collapse its structure.
00:31:08.908,00:31:14.664,"Yeah, and that's where I gotta chime in because, really I wouldn't wanna go in there with that limited amount of information."
00:31:14.747,00:31:16.499,"Newton, don't embarrass yourself."
00:31:16.583,00:31:18.126,Just hear me out for a second. Give me a second.
00:31:18.209,00:31:19.210,Please.
00:31:19.294,00:31:21.504,Why do we judge the Kaiju on a category system?
00:31:22.005,00:31:24.883,"It's because each one is completely different from the next, right?"
00:31:24.966,00:31:25.800,You see what I'm saying?
00:31:25.884,00:31:29.762,"Like, one looks like a shark and one looks like a fish-- Dr. Geiszler. Just get to the point."
00:31:29.846,00:31:30.680,Yes.
00:31:30.763,00:31:33.182,The point is I don't think they're all completely different after all.
00:31:33.474,00:31:35.018,"These are some samples I collected, all right?"
00:31:36.352,00:31:37.937,"Now, this one here was harvested in Sydney."
00:31:38.646,00:31:40.440,And this was harvested in Manila.
00:31:41.190,00:31:42.108,Six years ago.
00:31:42.942,00:31:45.361,They have the same exact DNA.
00:31:46.738,00:31:47.655,They're clones.
00:31:48.740,00:31:52.118,And this is the point where he goes completely crazy.
00:31:55.914,00:31:57.624,And we've really only scratched the surface.
00:31:58.499,00:32:00.209,This is a piece of a Kaiju's brain.
00:32:00.960,00:32:03.713,"Now, unfortunately, it's damaged. It's a little bit weak."
00:32:04.255,00:32:05.423,But it's still alive.
00:32:06.090,00:32:11.930,"Now, I think I can tap into it using the same technology that allows the two Jaeger pilots to share a neural bridge."
00:32:12.347,00:32:13.598,"Now, think about that."
00:32:13.681,00:32:17.518,I could tell you exactly how to get through the Breach yourselves.
00:32:17.602,00:32:20.146,You're suggesting that we initiate a Drift with a Kaiju?
00:32:20.229,00:32:24.067,"No, no. No, no. Not like a whole Kaiju, you know, just a tiny piece of its brain."
00:32:24.150,00:32:26.611,The neural surge would be too much for the human brain.
00:32:26.694,00:32:28.279,-I agree. -I don't agree.
00:32:29.572,00:32:32.325,"Gottlieb, I'd like your data on my desk ASAP."
00:32:32.408,00:32:33.242,Sir.
00:32:36.120,00:32:44.712,"Guys, now, this is the most amazing thing-- Newton, I know that you're desperate to be right so you've not wasted your life being a Kaiju groupie, but it's not going to work."
00:32:44.796,00:32:47.173,"It is going to work, Hermann. And I'll tell you something else."
00:32:48.049,00:32:50.259,"-Fortune favors the brave, dude. -You heard them."
00:32:50.343,00:32:54.555,"They won't give you the equipment and even if they did, you'd kill yourself."
00:32:55.640,00:32:56.975,Or I'd be a rock star.
00:33:01.104,00:33:02.146,There she is.
00:33:06.609,00:33:07.944,"Oh, my God."
00:33:10.530,00:33:11.406,Look at her.
00:33:13.324,00:33:14.575,Gipsy Danger.
00:33:16.577,00:33:18.955,"God, it's so beautiful."
00:33:22.208,00:33:24.335,She has a double-core nuclear reactor.
00:33:25.086,00:33:26.587,She's one of a kind now.
00:33:28.548,00:33:29.590,She always was.
00:33:33.052,00:33:36.681,"Solid iron hull, no alloys. Forty engine blocks per muscle strand."
00:33:37.140,00:33:40.226,Hyper-torque driver for every limb and a new fluid synapse system.
00:33:41.394,00:33:42.228,Come here.
00:33:52.405,00:33:53.448,"So, what's your story?"
00:33:54.282,00:33:57.493,"Restoring old Jaegers, showing has-beens like me around."
00:33:58.161,00:33:58.995,That can't be it.
00:34:00.246,00:34:01.205,You a pilot?
00:34:01.289,00:34:02.999,No. Not yet.
00:34:04.250,00:34:05.960,"But I wanna be one, more than anything."
00:34:07.211,00:34:08.421,What's your simulator score?
00:34:09.213,00:34:11.424,"Fifty-one drops, 51 kills."
00:34:11.799,00:34:12.759,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:34:14.052,00:34:15.970,But you're not one of the candidates tomorrow?
00:34:17.096,00:34:18.014,I am not.
00:34:18.806,00:34:20.349,The marshal has his reasons.
00:34:21.225,00:34:22.810,"Yeah, he always does, doesn't he?"
00:34:22.894,00:34:25.646,"But with 51 kills, I can't imagine what they could be."
00:34:28.149,00:34:30.068,I hope you approve of my choices.
00:34:30.902,00:34:33.279,I've studied your fighting techniques and strategy.
00:34:33.780,00:34:35.823,Even Alaska.
00:34:36.616,00:34:37.533,And what do you think?
00:34:39.952,00:34:42.914,I think you're unpredictable.
00:34:43.956,00:34:47.710,You have a habit of deviating from standard combat techniques.
00:34:47.794,00:34:50.755,You take risks that endanger yourself and your crew.
00:34:51.923,00:34:54.050,I don't think you're the right man for this mission.
00:34:57.303,00:34:58.137,Wow.
00:34:59.680,00:35:02.225,Thank you for your honesty. You might be right.
00:35:03.226,00:35:09.482,"But one day, when you're a pilot, you're gonna see that in combat you make decisions."
00:35:13.820,00:35:15.863,And you have to live with the consequences.
00:35:18.282,00:35:19.450,That's what I'm trying to do.
00:35:54.235,00:35:56.237,"We will commence the trials immediately, sir."
00:35:56.320,00:35:57.822,-Good. -But there is one thing.
00:35:57.905,00:36:00.491,"Mako, we have talked about this."
00:36:01.159,00:36:02.743,We will not be talking about it again.
00:36:04.412,00:36:05.454,You promised me.
00:36:07.665,00:36:08.958,I should be the one driving Gipsy with him.
00:36:09.083,00:36:09.917,Mako...
00:36:13.254,00:36:15.840,Vengeance is like an open wound.
00:36:17.216,00:36:19.343,You cannot take that level of emotion into the Drift.
00:36:19.427,00:36:21.387,"-For my family, I need to. -If we had more time..."
00:36:36.319,00:36:37.236,Come sit with us.
00:36:37.737,00:36:39.113,"Oh, I'm okay, thank you."
00:36:39.197,00:36:41.449,"Ah, come on, there's plenty of room at our table."
00:36:44.577,00:36:45.411,Hong Kong.
00:36:45.912,00:36:48.039,"Beauty of an open port, no rationing."
00:36:48.664,00:36:52.251,"We've got potatoes, peas, sweet beans, decent meat loaf."
00:36:52.335,00:36:53.169,Pass the potatoes.
00:36:54.754,00:36:57.215,"Raleigh, this is my son Chuck. He's my co-pilot now."
00:36:57.757,00:36:58.966,He's more my co-pilot.
00:36:59.050,00:36:59.967,"Right, Dad?"
00:37:00.968,00:37:02.553,"So you're the guy, eh?"
00:37:02.929,00:37:06.057,You're the guy who's gonna run defense for me in that old rust bucket of yours?
00:37:06.390,00:37:07.225,That's the plan.
00:37:08.559,00:37:10.937,"So when was the last time you jockeyed, Ray?"
00:37:12.438,00:37:13.481,About five years ago.
00:37:14.357,00:37:17.902,"What have you been doing for five years? Something pretty important, I reckon."
00:37:19.237,00:37:20.112,I was in construction.
00:37:20.196,00:37:21.864,"Oh, wow, that's great."
00:37:22.615,00:37:23.991,"I mean, that's really useful."
00:37:24.617,00:37:26.911,"We get into a fight, you can build our way out of it, eh, Ray?"
00:37:28.829,00:37:29.664,It's Raleigh.
00:37:30.665,00:37:31.499,Whatever.
00:37:32.625,00:37:34.752,"Look, you're Pentecost's bright idea."
00:37:35.169,00:37:36.671,"And my old man, he seems to like you."
00:37:36.754,00:37:39.382,But it's guys like you who brought down the Jaeger program.
00:37:39.924,00:37:41.467,"To me, you're dead weight."
00:37:42.093,00:37:44.971,"You slow me down, I'm gonna drop you like a sack of Kaiju shit."
00:37:46.806,00:37:49.225,"I'll see you around, Raleigh. Come on, Max."
00:37:51.936,00:37:54.772,You can blame me for that one. I've raised him on my own.
00:37:54.897,00:37:58.776,"He's a smart kid, but I never knew whether to give him a hug, or a kick in the ass."
00:38:01.487,00:38:02.571,"With respect, sir..."
00:38:04.198,00:38:05.700,I'm pretty sure which one he needs.
00:38:14.667,00:38:16.085,Four points to zero.
00:38:26.929,00:38:28.306,Four points to one.
00:38:44.196,00:38:45.448,Four points to two.
00:38:46.532,00:38:47.366,"Okay, what?"
00:38:48.659,00:38:51.370,You don't like them? I thought you selected them personally.
00:38:51.454,00:38:52.496,Excuse me?
00:38:52.580,00:38:58.502,"Every time a match ends you make this little gesture, like you're critical of their performance."
00:38:59.003,00:39:01.547,"It's not their performance, it's yours."
00:39:01.630,00:39:04.800,Your gambit. You could have taken all of them two moves earlier.
00:39:06.385,00:39:08.220,-You think so? -I know so.
00:39:08.679,00:39:09.638,Can we change this up?
00:39:11.098,00:39:12.224,How about we give her a shot?
00:39:14.602,00:39:17.563,"No. We stick to the cadet list we have, ranger."
00:39:18.272,00:39:21.567,"Only candidates with Drift compatibility-- Which I have, Marshal."
00:39:21.650,00:39:23.361,"Mako, this is not only about a neural connection."
00:39:23.444,00:39:25.738,It's also about a physical compatibility.
00:39:25.821,00:39:26.822,"What's the matter, Marshal?"
00:39:27.490,00:39:29.575,Don't think your brightest can cut it in the ring with me?
00:39:33.287,00:39:34.121,Go.
00:39:40.669,00:39:41.837,Four strikes marks a win.
00:39:47.259,00:39:49.261,"Remember, it's about compatibility."
00:39:49.845,00:39:51.347,"It's a dialog, not a fight."
00:39:51.806,00:39:53.682,But I'm not gonna dial down my moves.
00:39:57.103,00:39:58.145,Then neither will I.
00:40:16.038,00:40:16.872,One-zero.
00:40:19.083,00:40:19.917,One-one.
00:40:24.505,00:40:26.382,Two-one. Concentrate.
00:40:35.057,00:40:35.891,Two-two.
00:40:35.975,00:40:37.101,Better watch it.
00:40:49.113,00:40:49.947,Three-two.
00:40:52.491,00:40:54.034,More control.
00:41:16.515,00:41:17.349,Enough.
00:41:19.643,00:41:20.811,I've seen what I need to see.
00:41:21.312,00:41:22.146,Me too.
00:41:22.855,00:41:24.023,She's my co-pilot.
00:41:27.735,00:41:29.904,"-Why not? -Because I said so, Mr. Becket."
00:41:29.987,00:41:31.197,I made my decision.
00:41:31.280,00:41:35.075,Report to the Shatterdome in two hours and find out who your co-pilot will be.
00:41:52.676,00:41:53.677,What was all that about?
00:41:55.429,00:41:57.389,"I mean, I'm not crazy. You felt it, right?"
00:41:58.140,00:41:59.225,We are Drift compatible.
00:42:00.184,00:42:01.685,Thank you for standing up for me.
00:42:02.520,00:42:05.105,But there is nothing to talk about.
00:42:10.569,00:42:11.529,That's my room.
00:42:13.906,00:42:14.740,Excuse me.
00:42:15.449,00:42:17.785,"I mean, come on. I thought you wanted to be a pilot."
00:42:18.577,00:42:20.704,"Mako, this is worth fighting for."
00:42:22.831,00:42:24.333,We don't have to just obey him.
00:42:26.460,00:42:28.337,"It's not obedience, Mr. Becket."
00:42:32.132,00:42:33.175,It's respect.
00:42:35.553,00:42:37.888,Would you at least tell me what his problem is?
00:43:01.537,00:43:11.422,"which showed the ineffective nature of the Wall of Life program, many are questioning the government's motives and wondering why the Jaeger program has been discontinued."

00:43:27.396,00:43:28.439,What about the rest of us?
00:43:31.859,00:43:33.986,is still our best option at this time.
00:43:34.069,00:43:35.863,And that's all I'm gonna say on the matter. Thank you.
00:43:41.285,00:43:43.245,"Kaiju/Human Drift experiment, take one."
00:43:45.122,00:43:45.956,"The, uh..."
00:43:46.874,00:43:48.834,The brain segment is the frontal lobe.
00:43:49.793,00:43:54.840,"Um, chances are, the segment's far too damaged to Drift with."
00:43:55.716,00:44:08.979,"Unscientific aside, Hermann, if you're listening to this, well, I'm either alive and I've proven what I've just done works, in which case, ha, ha, I won, or I'm dead and I'd like you to know that it's all your fault."
00:44:09.063,00:44:10.522,"It really is. You know, you drove me to this."
00:44:11.023,00:44:12.441,"In which case, ha, I also won."
00:44:14.276,00:44:15.110,Sort of.
00:44:16.403,00:44:17.529,I'm going in in three...
00:44:19.490,00:44:20.324,Two...
00:44:21.533,00:44:22.368,One.

00:45:12.376,00:45:14.795,Gipsy Danger neural test...
00:45:24.596,00:45:25.722,"May I come in, Mako?"
00:45:32.312,00:45:35.441,"A long time ago, I made you a promise."
00:45:45.951,00:45:48.120,These transmitters are non-operative. I need them replaced.
00:45:56.920,00:45:58.172,Waiting for second pilot.
00:46:09.308,00:46:11.143,I'm gonna take this side if you don't mind.
00:46:11.518,00:46:12.978,My left arm's kind of shot.
00:46:13.812,00:46:14.813,Sure.
00:46:17.774,00:46:18.942,Are you gonna say anything?
00:46:20.777,00:46:24.031,No point. In five minutes you're gonna be inside my head.
00:46:25.365,00:46:26.408,You look good.
00:46:33.081,00:46:36.001,-Prepare for neural handshake. -Initiating neural handshake.

00:46:55.854,00:46:57.231,The Drift is silence.

00:47:30.681,00:47:32.975,Ready to activate the Jaeger.
00:47:35.185,00:47:37.312,"Okay, Gipsy. Lining up nicely."
00:47:38.689,00:47:39.606,Better get ready.
00:47:44.152,00:47:45.320,I need to talk to you.
00:47:46.905,00:47:49.533,I'm sure you can appreciate how important this moment is to me.
00:47:49.616,00:47:53.120,Newton created a neural bridge from garbage and Drifted with a Kaiju.
00:47:56.832,00:48:01.253,I found him prone and he's sort of dazed.
00:48:01.336,00:48:03.964,I don't exactly know what to do.
00:48:08.135,00:48:09.177,I told you it would work.
00:48:09.720,00:48:12.472,"Yes, you did. Well, what'd you see?"
00:48:12.556,00:48:19.313,"It was only a fragment of a brain, so really all I was able to get was, like, a series of, uh, images or impressions, you know."
00:48:19.396,00:48:22.816,"Like when you blink your eyes over and over and over again all you really see are, like, frames."
00:48:22.899,00:48:24.318,"-It was emotion. -Newton, Newton."
00:48:25.444,00:48:27.654,"Okay, Newton. Newton, look at me."
00:48:29.573,00:48:33.827,"Now, I want you to take your time and be very specific."
00:48:34.453,00:48:36.622,Okay. Okay.
00:48:37.122,00:48:41.627,"Well, I don't feel like they're just following some sort of animalistic urge, you know, just hunting and gathering."
00:48:42.169,00:48:43.920,And I think they're attacking us under orders.
00:48:44.004,00:48:45.172,That's impossible.
00:48:45.255,00:48:47.049,-Is that impossible? -It's impossible.
00:48:51.928,00:48:54.640,"You, keep talking."
00:48:57.726,00:49:01.980,"These beings, these masters, they're colonists."
00:49:02.064,00:49:02.981,They overtake worlds.
00:49:03.065,00:49:05.901,"They just consume them, and then they move on to the next."
00:49:06.610,00:49:09.112,And they've been here before in sort of a trial run.
00:49:09.655,00:49:10.781,It was the dinosaurs.
00:49:11.365,00:49:12.908,"But the atmosphere wasn't conducive, right?"
00:49:12.991,00:49:15.369,So they waited it out. And they waited it out.
00:49:15.452,00:49:20.248,"And now with ozone depletion, and carbon monoxide, polluted waters, well, we've practically terraformed it for them."
00:49:20.832,00:49:23.418,"Because now they're coming back, and it's perfect."
00:49:23.502,00:49:25.253,"See, the first wave, that was just the hounds."
00:49:25.337,00:49:27.130,"Categories 1 through 4, it was nothing."
00:49:27.214,00:49:30.425,Their sole purpose was to aim for the populated areas and to take out the vermin. Us!
00:49:30.509,00:49:32.636,"The second wave, that is the exterminators."
00:49:32.719,00:49:34.471,And they will finish the job.
00:49:34.554,00:49:37.307,And then the new tenants will take possession.
00:49:39.726,00:49:44.523,The reason that I found the identical DNA in the two separate Kaiju organs is because they are grown!
00:49:45.148,00:49:46.566,"Newton, I need you to do it again."
00:49:47.275,00:49:48.318,I need more information.
00:49:51.988,00:49:54.866,"I mean, not unless you have a fresh Kaiju brain lying around."
00:49:58.704,00:49:59.621,Do you?
00:50:06.962,00:50:07.796,Pretty impressive.
00:50:08.672,00:50:10.215,"Yeah, he remembers how to turn it on."
00:50:10.298,00:50:11.967,"Oi, show some respect."
00:50:12.467,00:50:15.011,"When his brother died, he got the Jaeger back to shore on his own."
00:50:15.095,00:50:17.013,I've known one other pilot that's been able to do that.
00:50:18.390,00:50:23.186,"Now, there are certain individuals whose business is the preservation and exploitation of Kaiju remains."
00:50:23.270,00:50:25.897,"Uh, yeah, right, um, black market dealers, right?"
00:50:25.981,00:50:28.066,Yep. They're in and out in a matter of hours.
00:50:28.150,00:50:31.445,They neutralize the acidic factor of the blood and they harvest what they need.
00:50:32.279,00:50:34.740,"Now, this guy, this is Hannibal Chau."
00:50:35.699,00:50:37.534,He runs the Kaiju black market here in Asia.
00:50:37.617,00:50:42.914,"When our funding ran out, we turned to him for help and in return, I gave him exclusive rights to all Kaiju remains in the region."
00:50:42.998,00:50:44.124,You did that?
00:50:44.207,00:50:45.375,"Last days of war, gentlemen."
00:50:46.543,00:50:48.378,Go to the corner of Fong and Tull.
00:50:48.462,00:50:50.172,Show them that card. Look for that symbol.
00:50:50.839,00:50:53.592,"And a word to the wise, do not trust him."
00:51:03.810,00:51:12.736,"Raleigh, listen to me! You need-- -Both out of alignment. -Both of them?"
00:51:14.571,00:51:16.698,"Gipsy, Gipsy! You're out of alignment!"
00:51:16.782,00:51:18.909,-You are both out of alignment. -I'm okay. Just let me control it.
00:51:22.454,00:51:24.164,-Mako. -She's starting to chase the rabbit!
00:51:24.831,00:51:26.958,"Mako, don't get stuck in a memory."
00:51:27.042,00:51:29.544,Stay with me. Stay in the now.
00:51:32.506,00:51:33.340,Mako.
00:51:37.010,00:51:37.844,Mako?
00:52:02.327,00:52:03.411,Mama!
00:52:58.508,00:52:59.342,Mako.
00:53:00.427,00:53:01.761,This is just a memory.
00:53:02.596,00:53:03.972,None of this is real.
00:53:31.166,00:53:33.376,Plasma cannon powering up.
00:53:47.891,00:53:48.975,Weapon system engaged!
00:53:49.059,00:53:50.143,Go to fail-safe!
00:53:50.226,00:53:52.562,Fail-safe not responding. There's a problem with the neural blocker!
00:53:52.646,00:53:54.147,Her connection's way too strong!
00:53:58.276,00:53:59.569,"Mako, listen to me."
00:53:59.986,00:54:02.572,This is just a memory. None of it is real.
00:54:05.116,00:54:05.951,"Everybody out of here, now!"
00:54:23.051,00:54:24.511,Get the main power line!
00:54:44.906,00:54:47.492,Take them offline! Take them offline!
00:54:49.285,00:54:50.203,I just did.
00:55:04.009,00:55:04.843,Mako!
00:55:16.438,00:55:18.732,It's okay. It's okay.
00:55:22.485,00:55:24.988,Would you like to try again?
00:55:45.216,00:55:46.092,Hmm...
00:55:56.227,00:55:57.062,Hello.
00:56:20.293,00:56:21.461,Some... Some bone...
00:56:22.295,00:56:24.380,Some bone powder?
00:56:24.464,00:56:26.132,"Uh, no, why would I want that?"
00:56:26.633,00:56:27.967,Male potency.
00:56:28.968,00:56:29.886,I take it myself.
00:56:30.720,00:56:32.680,"I see. Uh, no, thank you."
00:56:33.598,00:56:35.350,I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.
00:56:37.727,00:56:38.561,Come.
00:56:41.815,00:56:43.108,"You want Chau, huh?"
00:56:44.859,00:56:45.693,Good luck.
00:56:54.244,00:56:57.997,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God, this place is heaven!"
00:56:58.373,00:57:02.252,That's a lymph gland from a Category 2! And what are you working on here?
00:57:02.335,00:57:04.921,Is this a cuticle? In mint condition?
00:57:06.047,00:57:07.465,Is that a Kaiju skin parasite?
00:57:07.966,00:57:09.509,I've never seen them alive before!
00:57:09.592,00:57:11.970,They usually die as soon as the Kaiju falls!
00:57:12.053,00:57:13.596,I thought you couldn't keep them alive!
00:57:21.020,00:57:22.105,What do you want?
00:57:22.188,00:57:23.481,I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.
00:57:23.565,00:57:24.566,I was told he was here.
00:57:27.694,00:57:28.611,Who wants to know?
00:57:30.238,00:57:31.197,I really can't say.
00:57:37.203,00:57:38.663,Stacker Pentecost sent me!
00:57:42.083,00:57:44.669,"Oh, that's great. That's real great."
00:57:44.752,00:57:46.671,"So I take it you're Hannibal Chau, right?"
00:57:46.754,00:57:47.589,You like the name?
00:57:47.922,00:57:53.386,I took it from my favorite historical character and my second-favorite Sichuan restaurant in Brooklyn.
00:57:53.970,00:57:58.016,Now tell me what you want before I gut you like a pig and feed you to the skin louse.
00:58:04.147,00:58:07.233,"The Kaiju keep evolving, they keep kicking our asses!"
00:58:07.317,00:58:09.319,"He's a has-been, she's a rookie."
00:58:09.402,00:58:12.572,"I don't want them protecting my bomb run, sir."
00:58:18.077,00:58:19.496,"Hey, stay there."
00:58:20.663,00:58:21.623,Give me a moment.
00:58:25.251,00:58:27.337,You two are a goddamn disgrace.
00:58:28.505,00:58:35.970,"You're gonna get us all killed, and here's the thing, Raleigh, I want to come back from this mission because I quite like my life."
00:58:37.680,00:58:40.808,So why don't you just do us all a favor and disappear?
00:58:40.892,00:58:41.976,It's the only thing you're good at.
00:58:42.060,00:58:43.019,Stop! Now!
00:58:44.270,00:58:45.104,"Yeah, that's right."
00:58:46.064,00:58:47.815,You just hold back your little girlfriend.
00:58:49.025,00:58:50.693,One of you bitches needs a leash.
00:59:17.887,00:59:20.723,I said apologize to her.
00:59:27.480,00:59:29.816,"Hey, hey! Enough! What's going on?"
00:59:30.692,00:59:32.151,"On your feet, both of you!"
00:59:37.782,00:59:40.159,"Becket, Mori, into my office."
00:59:40.243,00:59:42.036,"-No, we aren't finished! -This is over!"
00:59:42.120,00:59:45.081,"You're a ranger, for Christ sake. Why don't you start acting like one?"
00:59:52.964,00:59:54.757,-It was my mistake. -No.
00:59:56.801,00:59:57.885,It was my mistake.
01:00:00.555,01:00:02.807,I should have never let you two in the same machine.
01:00:04.517,01:00:05.602,You're grounding us?
01:00:05.685,01:00:06.811,Not you.
01:00:15.278,01:00:17.030,"Permission to be dismissed, sir."
01:00:22.035,01:00:23.620,"Permission granted, Miss Mori."
01:00:28.916,01:00:29.834,Mako.
01:00:32.378,01:00:34.130,"Sir, what are you doing?"
01:00:34.213,01:00:36.758,She is the strongest candidate by far.
01:00:38.718,01:00:42.138,What other options do we have? Huh? Tell me!
01:00:42.221,01:00:46.225,"Do not let my calm demeanor fool you, ranger!"
01:00:47.477,01:00:50.396,Now is not a good moment for your insubordination!
01:00:51.981,01:00:55.068,Mako is too inexperienced to rein in her memories during combat.
01:00:58.196,01:01:00.114,That's not why you grounded her.
01:01:01.699,01:01:04.327,I was in her memories. I saw everything.
01:01:05.036,01:01:06.704,I don't care what you think you saw.
01:03:00.777,01:03:03.821,I know what she means to you. I saw it. I...
01:03:04.405,01:03:05.406,Hey! Hey!
01:03:05.490,01:03:06.908,This conversation is over.
01:03:07.700,01:03:11.746,"Marshal. Marshal, can we just talk about this for one second?"
01:03:17.418,01:03:18.294,You rescued her.
01:03:19.587,01:03:20.421,You raised her.
01:03:21.339,01:03:23.216,You're not protecting her now.
01:03:23.299,01:03:25.009,You are holding her back.
01:03:25.468,01:03:28.346,"One, don't you ever touch me again."
01:03:29.222,01:03:32.141,"Two, don't you ever touch me again."
01:03:35.269,01:03:41.818,"Now, you have no idea who the hell I am or where I've come from and I'm not about to tell you my whole life story."
01:03:42.485,01:03:46.739,All I need to be to you and everybody on this dome is a fixed point.
01:03:47.240,01:03:49.242,The last man standing.
01:03:50.409,01:03:52.870,I do not need your sympathy or your admiration.
01:03:52.954,01:03:57.124,All I need is your compliance and your fighting skills.
01:03:58.292,01:04:03.005,And if I can't get that then you can go back to the wall that I found you crawling on.
01:04:03.881,01:04:05.299,Do I make myself clear?
01:04:12.598,01:04:13.432,"Yes, sir."
01:04:16.435,01:04:17.270,Good.
01:04:47.884,01:04:49.051,I should've warned you.
01:04:50.636,01:04:52.054,First Drifts are rough.
01:04:53.180,01:04:57.101,"But you weren't just tapping into my memories you were tapping into my brother's, too."
01:04:59.729,01:05:02.189,"When Yancy was taken, we were still connected."
01:05:05.359,01:05:08.613,"I felt his fear, his pain, his helplessness, and then..."
01:05:11.115,01:05:11.949,He was gone.
01:05:12.950,01:05:14.619,I felt it. I know.
01:05:18.539,01:05:23.252,"You know, you live in someone else's head for so long the hardest part to deal with is the silence."
01:05:23.794,01:05:28.716,"To let someone else in, to really connect, you have to trust them."
01:05:31.218,01:05:33.137,And today the Drift was strong.
01:05:41.604,01:05:42.563,Her heart.
01:05:43.439,01:05:45.358,When's the last time you saw it?
01:05:45.900,01:05:46.984,Not in a long time.
01:05:56.702,01:05:57.703,Double event.
01:06:02.458,01:06:05.711,"Dilation indicator, Category 4."
01:06:19.850,01:06:22.228,"We have two signatures, both Category 4s."
01:06:22.311,01:06:24.188,"Code names, Otachi and Leatherback."
01:06:24.355,01:06:25.690,They'll reach Hong Kong within the hour.
01:06:25.856,01:06:28.109,Evacuate the city. Shut down the bridges.
01:06:28.275,01:06:30.987,I want every single civilian in a refuge right now.
01:06:31.112,01:06:34.657,"Crimson Typhoon, Cherno Alpha, I want you to frontline the harbor."
01:06:34.991,01:06:35.950,Stay on the miracle mile.
01:06:36.200,01:06:38.911,"Striker, I want you to stay back, look after the coastline."
01:06:39.453,01:06:43.249,"We cannot afford to lose you, so only engage as a final option."
01:06:44.583,01:06:45.418,You two.
01:06:46.127,01:06:46.961,You stay put.
01:06:48.295,01:06:49.130,Let's go!
01:07:10.151,01:07:13.863,"Loccent, near positions and awaiting your orders."
01:07:18.284,01:07:19.785,"Guys, keep your eyes open."
01:07:19.910,01:07:23.039,"These Category 4s are the biggest we've ever seen, both in size and weight."
01:07:27.585,01:07:28.836,Disengaging transport.
01:07:49.231,01:07:51.400,Cherno Alpha in position. Miracle mile.
01:07:53.152,01:07:54.862,Cherno Alpha holding the coastline.
01:07:54.945,01:07:55.905,Beacon is on.
01:08:06.707,01:08:08.417,They believe the Kaiju were sent from heaven.
01:08:08.959,01:08:12.088,That the Gods are expressing their displeasure with our behavior.
01:08:12.421,01:08:13.464,The silly bastards.
01:08:14.173,01:08:15.758,-And what do you believe? -Well...
01:08:17.510,01:08:20.721,I believe that Kaiju bone powder is 500 bucks a pound.
01:08:20.971,01:08:23.891,-What do you want? -I need to access a Kaiju brain.
01:08:24.433,01:08:25.476,Completely intact.
01:08:25.559,01:08:29.146,"No, no. The skull plate is so dense that by the time you drill into it..."
01:08:29.230,01:08:31.982,The brain's rotted away. But I'm talking about the secondary brain.
01:08:32.066,01:08:37.029,"Now we both know that the Kaiju are so large, they need two brains to move around, like a dinosaur."
01:08:37.446,01:08:38.697,I want to get my hands on that.
01:08:39.156,01:08:39.990,Mmm.
01:08:40.950,01:08:42.952,"What the hell do you want a secondary brain for, anyway?"
01:08:43.202,01:08:44.954,"I mean, every part of the Kaiju sells."
01:08:45.788,01:08:47.123,"Cartilage, spleen, liver."
01:08:47.623,01:08:48.541,Even the crap!
01:08:48.958,01:08:53.295,One cubic meter of crap has enough phosphorous in it to fertilize a whole field!
01:08:53.504,01:08:54.338,But the brain...
01:08:55.381,01:08:56.215,Too much ammonia.
01:08:58.217,01:08:59.468,"So, what's the deal, little fella?"
01:08:59.760,01:09:00.761,"Well, that's classified."
01:09:01.595,01:09:03.347,"So, I couldn't tell you. Even if I wanted to."
01:09:04.306,01:09:06.600,-Mmm. -But it is pretty cool.
01:09:08.144,01:09:08.978,"So, I might tell you."
01:09:10.688,01:09:11.647,I'm gonna tell you.
01:09:12.356,01:09:13.899,I figured out how to Drift with a Kaiju.
01:09:14.733,01:09:16.402,"Are you funning me, son?"
01:09:16.902,01:09:18.654,It's fascinating how their minds work.
01:09:18.988,01:09:21.240,"Every single Kaiju, his mind's connected."
01:09:21.323,01:09:23.117,"The... The species has, like a..."
01:09:23.242,01:09:24.368,Like a hive mind.
01:09:27.955,01:09:28.998,Holy jeez.
01:09:30.624,01:09:31.917,"You've gone and done it, haven't you?"
01:09:32.918,01:09:34.003,"I did it a little bit, yeah."
01:09:37.965,01:09:39.425,You goddamn moron.
01:09:50.436,01:09:52.354,Movement on the right!
01:09:52.771,01:09:53.772,3 o'clock!
01:10:12.666,01:10:13.959,Thundercloud formation!
01:11:14.353,01:11:17.147,Loccent! Typhoon and Alpha are in trouble. We're moving in!
01:11:17.356,01:11:19.900,You are to hold your ground. Do not engage.
01:11:20.109,01:11:22.820,We need you to carry that bomb. Do you copy?
01:11:36.000,01:11:37.084,"Ah, screw this."
01:11:37.167,01:11:38.961,"Loccent, we're moving in now!"
01:11:53.183,01:11:54.435,Typhoon is gone.
01:11:54.518,01:11:55.394,Let's get this bastard.
01:12:16.206,01:12:17.583,We need backup immediately!
01:12:44.068,01:12:45.235,Water is reaching the reactor!
01:14:17.995,01:14:20.664,The blast. It jumbled all the Jaegers' electrical circuits.
01:14:20.914,01:14:22.249,-What the hell was that? -Loccent!
01:14:24.960,01:14:26.962,"This isn't a defense mechanism, it's a weapon!"
01:14:27.045,01:14:27.880,Get me Striker.
01:14:28.255,01:14:30.215,"Nothing, sir. The Mark 5s digital's fried."
01:14:30.424,01:14:32.134,It'll take me two hours to reroute the auxiliary.
01:14:32.718,01:14:34.136,"All the Jaegers, they're digital!"
01:14:36.597,01:14:38.307,Gipsy's analog. Nuclear.
01:14:53.363,01:14:55.574,We got two Kaijus. We gotta get out. This way.
01:14:58.160,01:15:00.704,There are two goddamn Kaiju headed straight for Hong Kong City.
01:15:00.829,01:15:03.165,"No, that's not possible. There's never been two before."
01:15:03.248,01:15:07.920,"Well, maybe that's because nobody ever Drifted with one before, eh? Genius!"
01:15:08.045,01:15:11.006,"When Jaeger pilots Drift, it's a two-way street."
01:15:11.089,01:15:13.175,"-A bridge, right? It sets up a connection. -Of course, yes."
01:15:13.467,01:15:14.510,Both ways!
01:15:15.093,01:15:17.596,"A hive mentality, you said!"
01:15:17.888,01:15:20.474,Maybe those Kaiju are trying to find you.
01:15:22.392,01:15:25.145,I'm gonna wait out this shit storm in my own private Kaiju bunker.
01:15:25.270,01:15:27.981,But you are going to a public refuge.
01:15:28.357,01:15:29.608,I tried it once.
01:15:30.609,01:15:31.443,Once.
01:15:32.110,01:15:33.237,Now get the hell out of here.
01:16:26.957,01:16:28.750,Move! Move! I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor!
01:16:31.044,01:16:32.129,"Okay, hold on. Let me in."
01:16:34.006,01:16:35.674,"Okay, I'm a doctor. Okay, let me in, I'm a doctor."
01:17:00.198,01:17:02.075,-There's no emergency power. -We gotta bail.
01:17:02.159,01:17:03.410,I'm gonna try something else.
01:17:03.827,01:17:05.454,No! Don't disengage!
01:17:09.041,01:17:09.958,My arm!
01:17:10.167,01:17:11.835,"Come on! Get on your feet, old man!"
01:17:12.002,01:17:13.462,Don't call me that!
01:17:23.972,01:17:28.435,Now you and I are the only thing standing between that ugly bastard and a city of 10 million people.
01:17:28.685,01:17:29.853,Now we have a choice here.
01:17:30.062,01:17:34.232,"We either sit and wait, or we take these flare guns, and do something really stupid."
01:17:52.584,01:17:53.543,"Hey, you!"
01:18:04.012,01:18:05.430,I think we just pissed it off!
01:18:30.956,01:18:32.499,"Get ready, this is for real!"
01:18:46.930,01:18:48.223,Kick his ass!
01:19:35.771,01:19:38.231,Come on! Let's do this! Together!
01:20:44.589,01:20:45.757,"Hang on, Mako!"
01:21:14.744,01:21:15.871,Empty the clip!
01:21:53.950,01:21:55.160,I think this guy's dead.
01:21:55.368,01:21:57.495,But let's check for a pulse.
01:22:07.964,01:22:08.798,No pulse.
01:22:39.496,01:22:40.538,He stopped right above us.
01:22:41.998,01:22:44.626,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This isn't a refuge."
01:22:45.293,01:22:46.336,This is a buffet line!
01:22:51.800,01:22:52.634,He knows I'm here.
01:22:53.301,01:22:55.595,-He knows I'm here! -Shh. He knows we're all here.
01:22:55.679,01:22:57.138,"No, you don't understand, he's trying to get me!"
01:22:57.764,01:22:59.099,"He knows I'm here, and he's trying to get me!"
01:23:00.517,01:23:01.518,The Kaiju wants the little dude!
01:23:02.018,01:23:03.770,What was she saying? I gotta get out of here!
01:23:05.897,01:23:06.815,"Oh, come on!"
01:23:08.358,01:23:09.567,Those were expensive glasses.
01:23:10.527,01:23:11.903,This is the worst.
01:25:27.914,01:25:29.999,"Choppers, do you have a visual? Over."
01:26:13.251,01:26:14.460,Come on!
01:26:38.234,01:26:39.235,I'll hold it!
01:27:49.722,01:27:52.183,Temperature's dropping! We're losing oxygen!
01:27:52.350,01:27:55.770,"Both plasma cannons are shot. We're out of options, Mako."
01:27:57.188,01:27:58.314,No! There's still something left.
01:28:11.369,01:28:12.328,For my family!
01:28:26.884,01:28:30.096,Fifty thousand feet to ground contact.
01:28:32.557,01:28:33.558,"Look, there!"
01:28:35.810,01:28:37.729,Altitude loss critical.
01:28:43.401,01:28:44.819,"Gipsy, listen to me!"
01:28:45.111,01:28:48.781,"Loosen all the shock absorbers, use your gyroscope as balance and ball up!"
01:28:49.032,01:28:50.533,It's your only chance!
01:28:55.830,01:28:56.664,Now!
01:29:03.838,01:29:06.507,"We're coming in too fast! Brace for it, Mako!"
01:29:42.251,01:29:43.086,Yeah.
01:29:44.087,01:29:44.921,You?
01:30:00.269,01:30:02.230,"-Go to Dr. Geiszler now! -Yes, sir!"
01:30:02.563,01:30:05.733,I want the two remaining Jaegers back to 100 percent functionality.
01:30:06.025,01:30:06.859,"Yes, sir!"
01:30:09.570,01:30:12.490,"We're gonna harvest the skin, the talons and the wing."
01:30:12.573,01:30:14.158,Germans are gonna go nuts for that stuff.
01:30:14.617,01:30:15.618,Let me see that map.
01:30:18.788,01:30:22.583,"Here is where the Kaiju fell, here's where we concentrate our efforts."
01:30:22.667,01:30:23.751,"-We'll get it, boss. -Right."
01:30:27.171,01:30:30.049,"Okay. Guess who's back, you one-eyed bitch?"
01:30:31.134,01:30:32.844,And you owe me a Kaiju brain.
01:30:53.447,01:30:54.740,My kid'd never admit it.
01:30:56.284,01:30:57.118,But he's grateful.
01:30:57.743,01:30:58.578,We both are.
01:31:09.714,01:31:17.680,"In all of my years fighting, I've never seen anything like that."
01:31:18.848,01:31:19.682,Well done.
01:31:21.559,01:31:22.393,Proud of you.
01:31:24.604,01:31:25.438,Proud of us all.
01:31:26.230,01:31:27.064,But...
01:31:28.816,01:31:34.197,"As harsh as it sounds, there is no time to celebrate."
01:31:36.741,01:31:38.326,We lost two crews.
01:31:40.411,01:31:41.579,No time to grieve.
01:31:46.584,01:31:47.710,Reset that clock.
01:32:01.057,01:32:02.099,Reset the clock.
01:32:34.715,01:32:37.218,"I still can't believe what you did to me. I mean, I could have been eaten."
01:32:38.052,01:32:39.262,"Well, that was definitely the plan."
01:32:40.221,01:32:42.181,"Lucky for you, that didn't become necessary, huh?"
01:32:42.598,01:32:45.309,"Thank you so much, you're so kind. I really appreciate all of this."
01:32:45.393,01:32:49.063,"But now, do you mind telling me exactly what is taking so long for your workers to get that brain?"
01:32:49.146,01:32:54.026,"Well, they pump the cavity full of CO2, just like in any other laparoscopic surgery."
01:32:55.194,01:32:57.363,"The CO2's gonna delay the acidic reaction, yes."
01:32:57.446,01:32:59.532,And it allows us to harvest.
01:32:59.615,01:33:01.784,But our boys need oxygen pumped into their suits.
01:33:01.867,01:33:02.702,They move slow.
01:33:04.287,01:33:05.329,"What's going on in there, boys?"
01:33:07.415,01:33:08.874,the upper pelvic area.
01:33:09.917,01:33:11.961,Moving to the 25th vertebra.
01:33:13.504,01:33:14.338,Shit.
01:33:14.880,01:33:18.718,"Even through the suit, boss, it smells like dead catfish in here."
01:33:23.431,01:33:24.265,Boss.
01:33:24.849,01:33:26.142,The secondary brain...
01:33:27.435,01:33:28.561,-is damage. -Oh.
01:33:28.644,01:33:29.979,-It's ruin. -Bitch!
01:33:30.062,01:33:31.355,How could they screw that up?
01:33:31.439,01:33:32.648,Wait. Wait.
01:33:33.482,01:33:35.109,What was that? Did he say wait? Why wait?
01:33:40.448,01:33:41.866,It's like a heartbeat.
01:33:43.617,01:33:46.495,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God, this can't be. Hold on a second."
01:33:46.579,01:33:48.164,Hey! Let me have that!
01:33:48.247,01:33:49.832,"Shh, shh! Listen, listen!"
01:33:51.083,01:33:51.917,Listen to this.
01:34:01.052,01:34:01.886,It's pregnant.
01:35:23.926,01:35:24.844,Gone.
01:35:25.761,01:35:27.012,His lungs weren't fully formed.
01:35:28.764,01:35:30.933,Umbilical cord tied around his neck.
01:35:31.809,01:35:35.187,No way he could survive outside the womb for more than a minute.
01:35:38.983,01:35:39.900,I knew he wouldn't make it.
01:35:49.743,01:35:50.786,Ugly little bastard.
01:35:51.662,01:36:40.711,"Anyway, I would-- How sick are you?"
01:36:42.004,01:36:43.214,And why didn't you tell me?
01:36:44.757,01:36:45.591,Uh...
01:36:47.009,01:36:48.135,What's to tell?
01:36:51.388,01:36:56.560,"You know them Mark 1s, we scraped them bad boys together in 14 months."
01:36:59.438,01:37:02.608,Last thing we were thinking about was radiation shielding.
01:37:04.193,01:37:06.028,I ran nearly a dozen missions.
01:37:08.405,01:37:13.786,"I stayed under the medical radar for a while, but the last time I jockeyed was in Tokyo."
01:37:13.869,01:37:16.372,"I finished the fight solo, but for three hours..."
01:37:18.374,01:37:19.333,I burned.
01:37:19.416,01:37:23.712,"They warned me if I ever stepped foot into a Jaeger again, the toll would be too much."
01:37:26.715,01:37:29.510,You and I are the only two that ever ran solo combat.
01:37:30.844,01:37:32.096,That's why I brought you here.
01:37:42.314,01:37:43.816,"-What is it? -Sir, it's happening."
01:37:44.191,01:37:47.903,"I just got two signatures with unprecedented dilation, 40-meter spikes."
01:37:48.153,01:37:49.071,What category?
01:37:49.154,01:37:50.823,"Checking the ratios, Category 4."
01:37:51.282,01:37:52.116,Where're they headed?
01:37:52.199,01:37:53.659,"That's the thing, they're not heading anywhere."
01:37:53.742,01:37:54.952,They're hovering just above the Breach.
01:37:56.120,01:37:57.496,It's like they're protecting it or something.
01:37:57.580,01:38:00.291,"All right, Gipsy, Striker on deck."
01:38:00.374,01:38:03.419,"Sir, Herc cannot ride. His arm..."
01:38:03.502,01:38:04.461,You heard me.
01:38:07.214,01:38:09.049,Two signatures. Two?
01:38:10.050,01:38:14.388,"There, there are two Kaiju signatures in the Breach, not three like I predicted!"
01:38:14.471,01:38:17.308,"Hermann! I haven't exactly had a very good day, okay?"
01:38:17.391,01:38:18.642,I got about five minutes...
01:38:19.727,01:38:22.313,Should be three-- ...before brain death occurs here!
01:38:22.396,01:38:24.440,I don't wanna spend it talking about your theories!
01:38:24.523,01:38:25.357,This is all wrong!
01:38:25.441,01:38:28.319,"There should be three Kaijus coming through, not two!"
01:38:28.402,01:38:33.115,"Oh, there should be three and there's two? I'm sorry, it hurts to be wrong-- I am not wrong, but there is something here we don't understand."
01:38:33.198,01:38:37.328,"Okay, Hermann, hopefully we can argue about any mistakes you made in your predictive model in the future!"
01:38:37.411,01:38:39.622,"But in the meantime, the neural interface is way off the charts!"
01:38:39.705,01:38:40.831,"If you want to help, help with that!"
01:38:40.956,01:38:41.999,"Newton, I am not wrong."
01:38:42.625,01:38:44.251,There is only one way to make sure.
01:38:45.711,01:38:49.048,And that is to do this together.
01:38:50.549,01:38:51.592,I'll go with you.
01:38:52.551,01:38:56.388,"That's what the Jaeger pilots do, share the neural load."
01:38:56.472,01:38:57.514,You're serious?
01:38:58.557,01:39:00.392,You would do that for me? Or...
01:39:01.310,01:39:02.895,You would do that with me?
01:39:03.312,01:39:05.856,"Well, with worldwide destruction a certain alternative..."
01:39:07.107,01:39:08.192,Do I really have a choice?
01:39:08.275,01:39:11.445,"Then say it with me, my man, We're gonna own this bad boy!"
01:39:11.987,01:39:16.742,"By Jove, we are going to own this thing for sure!"
01:39:26.001,01:39:27.044,You're not suited up.
01:39:27.378,01:39:29.755,"Yeah, I'm aware of that, Elvis. I need to know what's going on."
01:39:29.838,01:39:31.632,"He said suit up, so suit up."
01:39:31.715,01:39:34.301,"Tendo, I can't pilot Striker on my own, now, can I?"
01:39:35.010,01:39:37.137,"Dad's hurt, so who's gonna be my copilot?"
01:39:59.868,01:40:01.286,I don't remember it being so tight.
01:40:04.581,01:40:07.167,Getting back into that Jaeger will kill you.
01:40:10.504,01:40:12.339,Not getting into one would kill us all.
01:40:12.965,01:40:13.924,Listen...
01:40:15.592,01:40:17.177,You are a brave girl.
01:40:18.721,01:40:20.472,I'm so lucky to have seen you grow.
01:40:22.891,01:40:27.646,"But if I'm going to do this, I need you to protect me."
01:40:33.110,01:40:34.111,Can you do that?
01:40:39.658,01:40:40.492,Right.
01:40:43.954,01:40:44.997,Everyone!
01:40:46.457,01:40:47.291,Listen up!
01:40:53.881,01:40:54.715,Today...
01:40:57.092,01:40:57.926,Today...
01:41:00.304,01:41:13.817,"At the edge of our hope, at the end of our time, we have chosen not only to believe in ourselves, but in each other."
01:41:16.862,01:41:19.990,Today there's not a man nor woman in here that shall stand alone.
01:41:21.533,01:41:22.367,Not today.
01:41:24.286,01:41:29.291,"Today we face the monsters that are at our door, and bring the fight to them!"
01:41:30.834,01:41:33.462,Today we are canceling the apocalypse!
01:41:56.068,01:42:00.489,"You know, that was a great speech, but how exactly are you and I supposed to match up in there?"
01:42:01.156,01:42:02.825,I carry nothing into the Drift.
01:42:04.159,01:42:05.661,"No memories, no fear."
01:42:06.328,01:42:07.287,No rank.
01:42:07.788,01:42:10.958,"And as for you, well, you're easy."
01:42:11.708,01:42:14.294,You're an egotistical jerk with daddy issues.
01:42:14.378,01:42:16.505,A simple puzzle I solved on day one.
01:42:18.173,01:42:19.591,But you are your father's son.
01:42:21.844,01:42:22.970,So we'll Drift just fine.
01:42:24.930,01:42:25.931,Works for me.
01:42:41.697,01:42:42.531,"Hey, now."
01:42:51.790,01:42:53.625,you feel like there's nothing to talk about.
01:42:57.671,01:43:00.716,I just don't want to regret all the things -that I never said out loud. -Don't.
01:43:05.095,01:43:06.013,You don't need to.
01:43:13.228,01:43:14.104,I always have.
01:43:17.482,01:43:19.026,"Hey. Hey, handsome."
01:43:22.613,01:43:23.989,"Oh, I'm gonna miss you."
01:43:31.204,01:43:32.247,You look after him for me.
01:43:38.253,01:43:39.546,That's my son you got there.
01:43:43.050,01:43:43.884,My son.
01:43:50.265,01:43:54.144,"You know, Mako, all those years I spent living in the past..."
01:43:55.020,01:43:56.855,I never really thought about the future.
01:43:59.691,01:44:00.692,Until now.
01:44:03.403,01:44:05.155,I never did have very good timing.
01:44:24.633,01:44:25.717,You ready for this?
01:44:26.134,01:44:29.805,"-Oh, yes, yes. -Initiating neural handshake in five..."
01:44:30.514,01:44:31.348,Four.
01:44:31.723,01:44:32.557,Three.
01:44:33.016,01:44:33.850,Two.
01:44:34.351,01:44:35.185,One.
01:45:00.502,01:45:01.461,"Yes, of course."
01:45:02.838,01:45:04.047,I'm completely fine.
01:45:12.639,01:45:14.641,-The Drift. You saw it? -Yeah.
01:45:14.725,01:45:16.435,"-Did you? -Listen, we have to warn them."
01:45:17.102,01:45:18.603,The Jaegers... The Breach...
01:45:19.104,01:45:19.938,The plan...
01:45:20.772,01:45:22.149,It's not going to work.
01:45:52.054,01:45:53.430,"Neural handshake confirmed, sir."
01:45:54.097,01:45:56.516,Two actives still in circle formation in the Guam quadrant.
01:45:57.142,01:45:58.977,"Code names, Scunner, Raiju."
01:45:59.061,01:46:00.353,Both Category 4.
01:46:01.980,01:46:04.608,"Half a mile to the ocean cliff, we jump!"
01:46:05.442,01:46:07.444,"It's 3,000 meters to the Breach."
01:46:07.527,01:46:09.821,Half a mile? I can't even see a damn inch ahead!
01:46:10.405,01:46:12.407,How are we supposed to deliver the bomb?
01:46:15.118,01:46:17.954,Visibility's zero. Switching to instruments now.
01:46:30.133,01:46:31.760,Three o'clock! Three o'clock!
01:46:34.554,01:46:36.389,Right flank's clear. I got nothing.
01:46:36.473,01:46:39.309,Left now! And moving fast! Fastest Kaiju on record!
01:46:43.021,01:46:45.816,I don't see anything. It's moving too fast!
01:47:15.262,01:47:17.430,Four hundred meters and closing.
01:47:22.394,01:47:23.395,Bogeys are stopping.
01:47:31.611,01:47:33.864,"-Why the hell are they stopping? -I don't give a damn, sir!"
01:47:33.947,01:47:35.907,-We're 300 meters from the jump! -Something's not right!
01:47:37.450,01:47:39.202,Take the leap now!
01:47:41.830,01:47:44.416,"Move, you fascist! Blowing up the Breach, it's not gonna work!"
01:47:46.293,01:47:49.004,"Sir, just because the Breach is open does not mean you're able to get a bomb through."
01:47:50.672,01:47:53.091,like a bar code at the supermarket and then lets them pass.
01:47:53.175,01:47:55.969,"Okay, so you're gonna have to fool the Breach into thinking that you have the same code!"
01:47:56.386,01:47:57.888,And how are we supposed to do that?
01:47:57.971,01:47:59.848,By making it think you are a Kaiju.
01:47:59.931,01:48:01.766,"You have to lock onto the Kaiju, ride it into the Breach."
01:48:01.850,01:48:05.520,"The Throat will then read the Kaiju's genetic code, and let you pass."
01:48:07.689,01:48:09.691,like it always has and the mission will fail.
01:48:10.358,01:48:12.736,"All right. Now that you've heard all that, Striker, take the leap!"
01:48:12.819,01:48:15.322,Sir! I have a third signature emerging from the Breach!
01:48:17.908,01:48:18.825,It's a triple event.
01:48:19.367,01:48:20.660,"Oh, God, I was right."
01:48:21.536,01:48:22.537,How big is it?
01:48:22.954,01:48:25.373,-What category? -Category 5.
01:48:26.666,01:48:27.500,Striker.
01:48:28.251,01:48:29.377,It's a Category 5.
01:48:30.045,01:48:31.004,The first ever.
01:48:57.155,01:48:59.241,We're right behind you about 100 meters.
01:48:59.324,01:49:01.952,"We're gonna come around your three o'clock, try to flank him."
01:49:02.035,01:49:03.828,Standard two-team formation.
01:49:04.412,01:50:20.488,Just keep him busy for a few-- Full speed!
01:50:21.823,01:50:23.283,Get out of the way!
01:50:44.137,01:50:45.972,"We cannot deliver the payload, sir!"
01:50:47.057,01:50:49.893,We're still armed. But the hull is compromised!
01:50:50.226,01:50:51.978,"Half our systems are offline, sir."
01:50:52.062,01:50:53.021,We need to override the...
01:51:41.861,01:51:43.822,Both Kaijus are converging on Striker fast!
01:51:50.370,01:51:53.540,Gipsy! Do not come to our aid! Do you copy?
01:51:55.959,01:51:58.586,We can still reach you. We're coming for you.
01:51:58.920,01:52:00.296,"No, Raleigh, listen to me."
01:52:00.964,01:52:02.549,You know exactly what you have to do!
01:52:02.841,01:52:04.259,Gipsy is nuclear!
01:52:04.342,01:52:05.844,Take her to the Breach!
01:52:06.010,01:52:07.178,"I hear you, sir."
01:52:07.554,01:52:08.471,Heading for the Breach.
01:52:16.729,01:52:18.022,You can finish this.
01:52:19.983,01:52:21.526,I'll always be here for you.
01:52:22.861,01:52:24.696,You can always find me in the Drift.
01:52:30.994,01:52:32.912,We're a walking nuclear reactor.
01:52:33.913,01:52:35.582,We can destroy the Breach.
01:52:51.514,01:52:52.807,We can clear a path!
01:52:54.184,01:52:55.143,For the lady!
01:52:56.436,01:52:57.896,They're gonna detonate the payload.
01:53:00.773,01:53:02.525,"he said, If you have the shot, you take it!"
01:53:03.902,01:53:05.069,So let's do this!
01:53:08.823,01:53:10.074,"It was a pleasure, sir."
01:54:11.761,01:54:12.971,Systems are critical!
01:54:13.680,01:54:14.764,Fuel is leaking!
01:54:15.473,01:54:16.891,Our right leg's crippled!
01:54:18.226,01:54:20.645,-Let's finish this. -All systems critical.
01:54:20.979,01:54:21.896,What are they doing?
01:54:23.356,01:54:24.524,Finishing the mission.
01:54:27.819,01:54:28.861,We're heading for the Breach.
01:54:34.033,01:54:38.079,"Because one way or another, we're getting this thing done."
01:54:50.258,01:54:53.052,"On my count, rear jets!"
01:54:53.553,01:54:54.387,Three...
01:54:54.721,01:54:55.555,Two...
01:54:55.930,01:54:57.265,One. Now!
01:55:20.788,01:55:22.790,Mako's oxygen is down. Half capacity!
01:55:24.626,01:55:26.336,"-Can you reroute it? -I'm trying, sir."
01:55:50.026,01:55:51.277,They're in. They're in!
01:55:51.653,01:55:52.487,It worked.
01:56:11.714,01:56:15.635,Operating at 15 percent capacity.
01:56:16.594,01:56:18.388,Ten percent capacity.
01:56:19.138,01:56:20.056,Five percent.
01:56:20.515,01:56:21.641,He's giving her his oxygen.
01:56:26.270,01:56:27.605,"It's okay now, Mako."
01:56:28.481,01:56:29.399,We did it.
01:56:30.608,01:56:32.151,I can finish this alone.
01:56:33.361,01:56:34.696,All I have to do is fall.
01:56:36.364,01:56:37.657,Anyone can fall.
01:56:43.204,01:56:46.374,Start the core meltdown and get out of there. Do you hear me?
01:56:47.125,01:56:48.751,Get out of there now!
01:56:56.300,01:56:58.886,"One pod is ejected. No detonation, sir."
01:57:01.222,01:57:04.267,I'm initiating reactor override now!
01:57:08.813,01:57:09.647,What's going on?
01:57:09.731,01:57:11.858,Trigger's offline! He has to do it by hand.
01:57:11.941,01:57:13.735,He's out of time. He has to self-destruct now.
01:57:16.821,01:57:19.323,Manual activation required.
01:57:49.645,01:57:52.065,Manual override initiated.
01:57:52.648,01:57:54.817,Core meltdown in T-minus 60.
01:58:01.783,01:58:03.117,Fifty seconds.
01:58:44.951,01:58:45.785,Five.
01:58:46.244,01:58:47.078,Four.
01:58:47.620,01:58:48.454,Three.
01:59:00.550,01:59:02.718,Direct hit! The Breach has collapsed!
01:59:06.264,01:59:09.308,To the choppers! To the choppers now!
01:59:26.534,01:59:27.660,Visuals on first pod.
01:59:28.327,01:59:30.997,Tracking solid. Vital signs are good.
01:59:36.627,01:59:37.962,"Okay, where's the second pod?"
01:59:39.338,01:59:41.257,"I'm tracking it, but I'm getting no vital signs."
02:00:11.621,02:00:12.955,I don't think he's breathing.
02:00:13.039,02:00:15.708,Can you read his pulse? Does he have a pulse?
02:00:18.836,02:00:20.421,It could be the sensors are not working.
02:00:21.422,02:00:22.340,We can't be sure.
02:00:24.717,02:00:26.510,No. Don't go.
02:00:31.390,02:00:32.225,Mako.
02:00:36.729,02:00:38.397,Don't go. Please.
02:00:50.284,02:00:51.452,I couldn't breathe.
02:01:07.760,02:01:09.637,This is Marshal Hercules Hansen.
02:01:10.554,02:01:11.764,The Breach is sealed.
02:01:13.266,02:01:14.433,Stop the clock!
02:01:44.005,02:01:46.215,We have your position. The choppers are on their way.
02:01:46.299,02:01:47.675,"Just, just hang on."
02:01:51.387,02:01:52.221,Are you okay?
02:01:53.889,02:01:54.849,Do you copy?
02:01:56.392,02:01:57.977,"Uh, guys?"
02:04:58.199,02:05:00.826,Where is my goddamn shoe?
