00:01:12.625,00:01:17.625,"Then he said, Someday, when you're ready, you might tell our family story."
00:01:18.791,00:01:22.833,Only then will you understand what happened and why.
00:01:40.375,00:01:44.666,"In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing."
00:01:53.208,00:02:02.375,"We lived at the junction of great trout rivers, in Missoula, Montana, where Indians still appeared out of the wilderness to walk the honky-tonks and brothels of Front Street."
00:03:39.791,00:03:43.875,My father was a Presbyterian minister and a fly-fisherman.
00:03:49.791,00:03:55.958,"was given over wholly to religion, even then he told us about Christ's disciples being fishermen."
00:03:56.541,00:04:08.666,"And we were left to assume, as my younger brother, Paul, and I did, that all first-class fishermen on the Sea of Galilee were fly-fishermen and that John, the favorite, was a dry fly-fisherman."
00:04:09.166,00:04:13.208,The poor without Christ are of all men the most miserable.
00:04:15.083,00:04:20.333,But the poor with Christ are princes and kings of the earth.
00:04:24.208,00:04:25.916,while he unwound between services.
00:04:27.083,00:04:32.458,"He almost always chose a path along the Big Blackfoot, which we considered our family river."
00:04:33.083,00:04:37.708,And it was there he felt his soul restored and his imagination stirred.
00:04:39.166,00:04:42.333,"Long ago, rain fell on mud and became rock."
00:04:42.416,00:04:44.500,Half a billion years ago.
00:04:46.625,00:04:53.416,"But even before that, beneath the rocks, are the words of God."
00:04:54.041,00:04:55.375,Listen.
00:05:06.625,00:05:08.291,we might hear those words.
00:05:14.291,00:05:21.166,"Even so, Paul and I probably received as many hours of instruction in fly-fishing as we did in all other spiritual matters."
00:05:23.541,00:05:33.791,"As a Presbyterian, my father believed that man by nature was a damned mess and that only by picking up God's rhythms were we able to regain power and beauty."
00:05:34.333,00:05:35.666,Ten and two.
00:05:35.750,00:05:45.291,"To him, all good things, trout as well as eternal salvation, come by grace, and grace comes by art, and art does not come easy."
00:05:45.375,00:05:46.208,Norman.
00:06:01.375,00:06:03.666,He began each session with the same instruction.
00:06:04.458,00:06:09.541,Casting is an art that is performed on a four-count rhythm between ten o'clock and two o'clock.
00:06:14.125,00:06:19.875,"If he had had his way, nobody who did not know how to catch a fish would be allowed to disgrace a fish by catching it."
00:06:28.291,00:06:31.041,"So it was with my formal education, as well."
00:06:32.333,00:06:38.250,"Each weekday, while my father worked on his Sunday sermon, I attended the school of the Reverend Maclean."
00:06:40.666,00:06:47.250,"He taught nothing but reading and writing and, being a Scot, believed that the art of writing lay in thrift."
00:06:59.083,00:07:00.000,Half as long.
00:07:10.375,00:07:13.250,I stayed home and learned to write the American language.
00:07:24.916,00:07:27.291,Again. Half as long.
00:07:55.958,00:07:58.125,Good. Now throw it away.
00:08:17.375,00:08:18.750,Wait for your brother!
00:08:31.500,00:08:39.458,"Every afternoon, I was set free, untutored and untouched till supper, to learn on my own the natural side of God's order."
00:08:49.833,00:08:53.250,And there could be no better place to learn than the Montana of my youth.
00:08:56.250,00:09:04.125,"It was a world with dew still on it, more touched by wonder and possibility than any I have since known."
00:09:43.000,00:09:45.666,"Hey, what the hell is going on?"
00:09:46.250,00:09:47.708,"Hey, where are you guys going?"
00:09:47.791,00:09:48.708,Chicken!
00:09:57.916,00:09:59.375,"Come on, move out of the way."
00:10:30.791,00:10:33.958,"Even as children, we understood that and admired it."
00:10:38.291,00:10:40.083,"And, of course, we had to test it."
00:10:42.083,00:10:44.916,"I knew I was tough, because I had been bloodied in battle."
00:10:45.000,00:10:47.500,"-Get him, get him! -Give him a shiner!"
00:10:47.583,00:10:49.583,Don't be a sissy!
00:10:49.666,00:10:50.916,Come on!
00:10:51.875,00:10:54.083,"Yeah, come on! Let's see some blood here!"
00:10:54.166,00:10:56.208,-Go on! -Lots of blood.
00:10:59.458,00:11:02.708,His toughness came from some secret place inside of him.
00:11:02.791,00:11:05.541,He simply knew he was tougher than anyone alive.
00:11:24.500,00:11:29.000,"Man has been eating God's oats for 1,000 years."
00:11:29.083,00:11:32.333,It's not the place of an 8-year-old boy to change that tradition.
00:12:36.208,00:12:37.333,Grace.
00:12:46.833,00:13:01.750,"Oh, God, who art rich in forgiveness, grant that we may hold fast the good things we receive from thee and as often as we've fallen to sin be lifted by repentance through thy grace. Amen."
00:13:09.000,00:13:10.208,"Minister, I guess."
00:13:12.625,00:13:14.583,Or a professional boxer.
00:13:15.125,00:13:17.333,You think you could beat Jack Johnson?
00:13:18.541,00:13:19.458,I don't know.
00:13:20.750,00:13:22.541,I think you could.
00:13:22.625,00:13:24.500,I'd lay a bet on it.
00:13:25.750,00:13:27.083,What are you going to be?
00:13:28.125,00:13:29.708,Professional fly-fisherman.
00:13:30.875,00:13:33.750,-There's no such thing. -There isn't?
00:13:33.833,00:13:34.708,No.
00:13:37.416,00:13:44.833,Hmm… I guess a boxer.
00:13:46.666,00:13:47.791,Not a minister?
00:14:03.208,00:14:08.666,"taking with it every able-bodied lumberjack, leaving the woods to old men and boys."
00:14:11.083,00:14:16.041,"So at 16, I did my duty and started working for the U.S. Forest Service."
00:14:18.958,00:14:29.958,It was a life of timber and toil with men as tough as their ax handles and more mountains in all directions than I would ever see again.
00:14:33.083,00:14:44.083,"Being too young to join me, Paul took a job as lifeguard at the municipal swimming pool so that during the day he could look over the girls and in the evenings he could pursue his other purpose in life."
00:14:44.166,00:14:45.000,Fishing.
00:15:50.916,00:15:52.000,"Preacher, come on."
00:15:59.333,00:16:01.916,"Preacher! Come on, Preacher!"
00:16:02.000,00:16:03.166,Shut up.
00:16:19.000,00:16:23.750,"Did I ever tell you guys what a forest fire sounds like coming down -a mountain at 60 miles an hour? -Oh, shut up!"
00:16:25.958,00:16:27.333,I've got a great idea.
00:16:28.416,00:16:30.166,I know how we can go down in history.
00:16:30.250,00:16:31.083,How's that?
00:16:31.625,00:16:35.041,"We borrow old man Seifert's rowboat, and we shoot the chutes."
00:16:35.125,00:16:37.083,"You can't shoot the chutes, Pauly."
00:16:37.166,00:16:39.416,-You can try. -You can die trying.
00:16:39.500,00:16:41.958,"They'd bury you with full honors. Tell him, Norm."
00:16:43.750,00:16:45.291,"Well, we would be the kings of Missoula."
00:16:45.375,00:16:47.208,"Yeah, kings. And we'd be famous."
00:16:47.791,00:16:50.041,And all of you would get your photographs in the paper.
00:16:50.708,00:16:51.791,I'm doing it.
00:16:53.125,00:16:54.583,-I am. -You'll die.
00:16:55.583,00:16:56.541,No.
00:16:58.750,00:17:00.750,Let's do it. Come on.
00:17:00.833,00:17:02.500,-I'm with you. -Let's do it!
00:17:03.875,00:17:05.416,-What? -All right.
00:17:06.125,00:17:07.083,Yeah!
00:17:07.916,00:17:09.125,All right.
00:17:13.041,00:17:14.166,Let's go!
00:17:19.958,00:17:20.958,I got the oars.
00:17:23.833,00:17:25.666,"Whose idea was this, anyway?"
00:17:25.750,00:17:27.083,"Where we going, Pauly?"
00:17:31.750,00:17:32.958,"Don't work too hard, Chub."
00:17:34.833,00:17:38.083,Goddamn rowboat! I need a woman!
00:17:55.958,00:17:57.958,"Jesus, Mary and Joseph."
00:18:12.916,00:18:13.916,Flip it.
00:18:20.250,00:18:22.208,"Okay, hop in."
00:18:27.416,00:18:29.166,"Come on, we can all fit."
00:18:29.250,00:18:38.500,"-I don't think so. -No, I… Hey."
00:18:39.375,00:18:41.875,"All right. Just me, Norm and Chub."
00:18:43.541,00:18:46.583,"Jeez, Pauly… Okay."
00:18:48.250,00:18:50.125,Then I guess it's just the Macleans.
00:19:16.083,00:19:17.625,You guys be careful!
00:19:28.750,00:19:30.416,"You ain't going over, Pauly!"
00:19:31.916,00:19:33.333,They'll pull to shore.
00:19:33.416,00:19:34.583,See you in heaven!
00:19:34.666,00:19:37.041,"Hey, come back here a second. I got to tell you something."
00:19:37.125,00:19:38.458,"Come on, guys!"
00:19:51.583,00:19:53.416,"See you later, boys!"
00:19:59.875,00:20:01.375,Otter on the right!
00:20:09.833,00:20:11.916,"On your right, watch the right!"
00:20:41.333,00:20:42.458,Right.
00:20:44.625,00:20:45.625,Watch it.
00:20:45.708,00:20:47.333,"On your right, on your right!"
00:20:54.291,00:20:55.333,Right!
00:21:03.291,00:21:04.416,Hang on!
00:21:26.583,00:21:27.666,"Oh, jeez."
00:21:32.291,00:21:34.125,-Maclean! -Hey!
00:21:38.375,00:21:40.291,Maclean!
00:21:48.291,00:21:50.250,Pauly!
00:21:50.333,00:21:51.333,"Hey, Chub!"
00:22:05.750,00:22:07.375,Maclean!
00:22:11.958,00:22:13.083,What the hell?
00:22:22.625,00:22:26.583,Son of a… Jesus Christ!
00:22:28.083,00:22:29.500,Crazy son of a bitch!
00:22:32.791,00:22:41.833,"-You guys okay? -Where's… Preach, you okay?"
00:22:43.125,00:22:44.041,Sure.
00:23:05.583,00:23:08.125,You will go to church this day and pray for forgiveness.
00:23:12.166,00:23:14.666,Your mother spent the night sick with worry.
00:23:14.750,00:23:16.166,Did you give any thought to her feelings?
00:23:16.875,00:23:18.250,Mrs. Campbell called.
00:23:22.166,00:23:23.208,Who gave you the boat?
00:23:24.291,00:23:25.791,-We… -Borrowed it.
00:23:27.125,00:23:28.083,Borrowed?
00:23:32.458,00:23:34.083,"Boys, what have you done?"
00:23:40.458,00:23:44.208,"Well, you will work off every cent of its value."
00:23:45.375,00:23:46.458,"Yes, sir."
00:23:47.250,00:23:49.750,"I'll work it off, Father. It was my idea."
00:24:06.250,00:24:07.458,What you making?
00:24:09.208,00:24:10.750,Know what you need on that?
00:24:10.833,00:24:13.208,"Ham, cheese and sardines. Delicious!"
00:24:13.291,00:24:15.166,-I don't want sardines. -I'll show you.
00:24:15.750,00:24:17.375,"Boy, can you believe those guys?"
00:24:17.458,00:24:20.291,They'll be telling everyone the class of '19 did it.
00:24:22.000,00:24:23.458,I should write an article.
00:24:23.541,00:24:24.875,Macleans conquer chutes.
00:24:24.958,00:24:26.583,-That'd show 'em. -I don't like sardines.
00:24:26.666,00:24:28.583,"And you could get it in the school paper, I bet."
00:24:30.041,00:24:32.458,"Chub. Jeez, Pauly."
00:24:33.750,00:24:35.125,What a skeezicks.
00:24:35.208,00:24:37.666,I don't want any goddamn sardines!
00:25:02.666,00:25:08.375,"No, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"
00:25:08.458,00:25:09.958,Stop!
00:25:10.583,00:25:12.500,"You hit her, you son of a bitch!"
00:25:12.583,00:25:15.833,"-You knocked her down, you bastard! -Son of a bitch."
00:25:15.916,00:25:18.625,"Please, I slipped, I slipped, I slipped!"
00:25:27.291,00:25:29.708,I just slipped. That's all.
00:25:52.708,00:25:55.541,Perhaps we wondered afterwards which one of us was tougher.
00:25:56.250,00:26:01.416,"But if boyhood questions aren't answered before a certain point, they can't be raised again."
00:26:02.083,00:26:06.833,"So, we returned to being gracious to one another as the church wall suggested."
00:26:45.000,00:26:47.000,I then saw something remarkable.
00:26:49.375,00:26:55.708,"For the first time, Paul broke free of our father's instruction into a rhythm all his own."
00:27:08.250,00:27:09.416,Okay.
00:27:19.875,00:27:20.958,Okay.
00:27:27.708,00:27:29.833,They're both marvelous.
00:27:38.833,00:27:41.333,I'd say the Lord has blessed us all today.
00:27:51.208,00:27:53.958,It's just that he's been particularly good to me.
00:28:08.291,00:28:12.958,"Sometime before, Father had told me that I was allowed to attend any college in the world I could get into."
00:28:14.041,00:28:20.166,"I knew he earned no more than $1,800 a year, so his offer meant more to me than anything in my life."
00:28:20.250,00:28:22.375,"Well, do your best."
00:28:22.458,00:28:23.500,I will.
00:28:37.750,00:28:39.916,"Hey, Norman! Norm!"
00:29:06.000,00:29:09.708,"for a 3,000-mile trip east to the unknown."
00:29:14.333,00:29:18.208,"To the son of a Montana minister, Dartmouth was more than an education."
00:29:18.291,00:29:22.500,It was a revelation exposing me to a world I had only guessed at.
00:29:30.083,00:29:40.291,"As part of my degree, I was required to enlighten incoming freshmen on the wonders of the Romantic poets, and although I was unaware of it then, teaching fit me."
00:29:41.583,00:29:48.208,"But most of the time, I sat in the card room of my fraternity house, giving my bluenose brothers a lesson in Front Street poker."
00:29:50.833,00:29:55.583,"In all, I spent six years at Dartmouth, away from home nearly all that time."
00:29:58.625,00:30:04.000,"On the other hand, Paul stayed home for college, unwilling to leave the fish he had not yet caught."
00:30:09.500,00:30:19.916,"After graduation, he took a job as a reporter for a Helena newspaper and moved to that town, his connection with the family growing as slight as my own."
00:30:29.458,00:30:33.833,It was not until the spring of 1926 that I finally did come home.
00:31:19.125,00:31:21.958,"Dinner is in half an hour. So, you have time for a bath."
00:31:24.500,00:31:25.958,"Do I look thin, Mother?"
00:31:29.875,00:31:31.458,"Do I look old, Norman?"
00:31:34.041,00:31:39.833,"No, you look… Wish Paul could have been here tonight."
00:31:40.375,00:31:41.791,He's working late.
00:31:47.916,00:31:48.875,Would you come in?
00:31:56.166,00:32:00.250,I'm sorry Paul won't be here. The life of a newspaperman.
00:32:02.250,00:32:06.875,"Well, you know how Paul likes to… I do."
00:32:07.666,00:32:08.750,Sit.
00:32:15.166,00:32:21.625,"I also hear that he… Well, I hear everything, don't I?"
00:32:21.708,00:32:23.625,Lord forbid my flock keep me in ignorance.
00:32:27.625,00:32:34.250,"Yes, you can bet that everyone from here to Helena knows the details of your education, Norman."
00:32:35.250,00:32:36.708,It is an achievement.
00:32:37.583,00:32:40.833,"So, to what use shall you put this achievement?"
00:32:45.791,00:32:48.041,"Well, I've been considering the Forest Service."
00:32:49.375,00:32:52.125,-As a career? -No.
00:32:55.000,00:32:56.666,"No, for the summer."
00:32:57.208,00:33:00.041,"Ah, as a break."
00:33:00.916,00:33:02.625,"Well, that's a good idea."
00:33:03.500,00:33:06.166,"-The body fuels the mind. -Yes, that's what I was thinking."
00:33:06.250,00:33:07.291,And after?
00:33:09.208,00:33:11.000,I'm not absolutely sure yet.
00:33:12.875,00:33:16.250,"Well, you've had six years to become sure, Norman."
00:33:26.416,00:33:29.208,Have you considered an advanced degree?
00:33:30.416,00:33:31.833,The law?
00:33:31.916,00:33:33.416,-Medicine? -No.
00:33:33.916,00:33:35.416,The ministry?

00:33:42.375,00:33:44.541,"Yes, college level, but I haven't heard anything yet."
00:33:44.625,00:33:51.000,"No, it's early, but… Now you have taught classes already, haven't you?"
00:33:51.750,00:33:52.583,Yes.
00:33:53.083,00:33:55.833,And did you find that experience rewarding?
00:33:55.916,00:34:00.500,"That is to say, do you feel this could be your calling?"
00:34:01.958,00:34:02.958,My calling?
00:34:24.708,00:34:26.625,"If it's so damn funny, how come I'm not laughing?"
00:34:26.708,00:34:27.541,"Yes, pee in their pants."
00:34:29.958,00:34:31.958,-Paul Maclean? -In there.
00:34:32.041,00:34:37.750,"The rules in Anaconda Mine say no breaks, not even for the john, so the poor bastards have to stand there and pee in their pants."
00:34:41.458,00:34:43.583,"Yeah, she's 23 and built like a brick shit house."
00:34:47.041,00:34:49.125,"But I'm the boss, Maclean."

00:35:11.375,00:35:12.916,Thanks for coming to see me last night.
00:35:13.000,00:35:16.166,"Yeah, damn. I am sorry about that. Wanted to be there."
00:35:16.916,00:35:20.708,"Wanted to hear the old man say, Norman, could you come into my study, please?"
00:35:28.583,00:35:30.750,"Jeez, the professor."
00:35:33.875,00:35:35.416,We should celebrate.
00:35:43.000,00:35:43.958,Yeah.
00:35:45.583,00:35:46.875,A little early for me.
00:35:49.583,00:35:51.458,The East is making you soft.
00:35:53.416,00:35:54.666,Is that right?
00:36:12.000,00:36:13.500,Do much fishing out East?
00:36:14.833,00:36:15.916,None.

00:36:18.416,00:36:21.166,"Well, what do you say? Big Blackfoot."
00:36:47.875,00:36:49.000,You set?
00:36:49.625,00:36:50.541,Yeah.
00:36:58.375,00:37:00.000,Why don't you take this hole? It's a good hole.
00:37:00.083,00:37:02.375,"-No, that's all right. -No, no, no, no. It's a good hole."
00:37:24.833,00:37:26.708,Too tight! Try a roll cast!
00:37:39.291,00:37:40.458,Ugh.
00:37:44.125,00:37:45.958,The fish are out further!
00:37:48.125,00:37:50.000,Just a little further.
00:37:51.958,00:37:55.250,Cast your line into the current. It'll give you a better base.
00:37:55.333,00:37:56.583,Add some distance.
00:37:57.416,00:37:59.208,"You're just rusty, that's all."
00:40:01.291,00:40:06.291,keeping his line above water long enough and low enough to make a rainbow rise.
00:40:08.708,00:40:14.083,"And I realized that in the time I was away, my brother had become an artist."
00:40:15.958,00:40:20.666,"And one day my coach comes up to me and says, Mac, how'd you like to meet John L. Sullivan?"
00:40:20.750,00:40:24.208,"-John L. Sullivan? -Yes, the John L. Sullivan!"
00:40:24.291,00:40:26.125,The last bare-knuckle champion of the world.
00:40:29.250,00:40:44.625,"standing on the steps of the Missoula library once again, late at night, telling stories to the same boys who had sat on those steps and listened 100 times before and who had, in my absence, become men."
00:40:44.708,00:40:48.000,"It just goes to show you, the world is full of bastards."
00:40:50.083,00:40:52.416,"the further one gets from Missoula, Montana."
00:40:52.500,00:40:54.166,-Amen! -Woo!
00:40:54.250,00:40:57.250,"See, professor, that's why you need to stick around here from now on."

00:41:15.541,00:41:16.833,Don't say no.
00:41:17.416,00:41:18.416,Where you going?
00:41:18.916,00:41:20.875,"-Heavy date, Paul? -Where you going, Pauly?"
00:41:20.958,00:41:22.375,With a poker table.
00:41:22.458,00:41:25.708,"Hey, you see they got them new signs on the way down, Pauly?"
00:41:25.791,00:41:29.500,"Does your husband misbehave, grunt and grumble, rant and rave?"
00:41:35.625,00:41:38.500,-The road to where? -Lolo.
00:41:38.583,00:41:39.958,Little hot spring!
00:41:55.000,00:41:59.583,"More than anything else, I realized it was my father's words that made me feel most at home."
00:41:59.666,00:42:20.250,"And in the glow of awakened memories, when the deepest feelings of the heart are all astir, we are reminded of the poet who sings, Backward, turn backward Oh, time, in your flight Make me a child again, just for tonight."
00:43:01.916,00:43:03.333,Recognize anybody?
00:43:05.583,00:43:07.125,"You been gone too long, son."

00:46:10.708,00:46:17.750,What better lesson for those girls than a trip to the reservation to learn a real Christian lesson of giving?
00:46:17.833,00:46:19.416,Hmm? Don't you think?
00:46:19.500,00:46:21.666,I'll organize it. Don't lift a finger.
00:46:21.750,00:46:23.250,"Oh, thank you, Eva."
00:46:23.333,00:46:26.708,This is the most charitable idea I've heard in years.

00:53:25.500,00:53:26.666,Exactly.
00:53:28.791,00:53:30.333,I have to dance.
00:53:43.000,00:53:44.416,"Hey, hey."
00:53:45.958,00:53:47.291,Watch out.
00:53:48.166,00:53:49.333,Wow.
00:54:19.416,00:54:22.000,And now the Muskrat Ramble.
00:55:06.875,00:55:10.958,"I'm nowhere near as good as my brother, but would you do me the honor?"
00:55:11.541,00:55:12.833,I'd love to.
00:55:55.375,00:56:03.833,"As the moon lingers a moment over the bitterroots before its descent into the invisible, my mind is filled with song."
00:56:04.708,00:56:10.083,"I find I am humming, softly, not to the music, but something else."
00:56:11.291,00:56:12.875,Someplace else.
00:56:14.541,00:56:16.083,A place remembered.
00:56:16.708,00:56:27.333,"A field of grass where no one seemed to have been except the deer, and the memory is strengthened by the feeling of you dancing in my awkward arms."
00:56:28.541,00:56:29.750,Norman.
00:56:45.750,00:56:46.833,Yes?
00:56:52.666,00:56:53.916,"It's okay, Mother."
00:56:54.750,00:56:55.791,Who is this?
00:57:11.583,00:57:13.666,I'm Norman Maclean.
00:57:13.750,00:57:16.333,"No, he doesn't have to post bond."
00:57:16.416,00:57:18.250,He covers the police beat and has friends here.
00:57:18.333,00:57:21.125,All you have to do is look at him and take him home.
00:57:22.875,00:57:24.208,What did he do?
00:57:24.291,00:57:27.083,He hit a guy and the guy's missing a couple teeth.
00:57:27.958,00:57:29.041,Why did he hit him?
00:57:30.666,00:57:36.208,It says here a remark was passed concerning the Indian woman he was with.
00:57:36.291,00:57:38.125,"Well, then the guy deserved it."
00:57:40.208,00:57:42.416,We're picking your brother up too much lately.
00:57:45.625,00:57:46.833,Is that right?
00:57:47.500,00:57:50.666,"Besides, he's behind in the big stud poker game at Lolo."
00:57:51.166,00:57:53.583,It's not healthy to get behind on that big game at Lolo.
00:57:57.000,00:57:58.291,Is he hurt?
00:57:58.375,00:58:02.000,"No, he's not hurt. He's just sick. He drinks too much."
00:58:02.750,00:58:05.958,Down at Lolo they don't drink too much.
00:58:11.666,00:58:13.208,You better go in and get your brother.
01:00:12.583,01:00:21.166,"If you need any money, Paul, or anything else, I want you to know that-- She lives past the slaughterhouse."
01:00:25.750,01:00:27.083,I can help.
01:00:31.416,01:00:32.833,Turn here.
01:01:06.250,01:01:08.458,"-I got it. -Whoa, whoa!"
01:01:29.375,01:01:30.791,Look at that!
01:01:30.875,01:01:35.166,"Well, the chickens haven't come home to roost yet, Al."
01:01:40.833,01:01:42.291,Not bad.
01:01:45.333,01:01:46.791,"Are you all right, Norman?"
01:01:46.875,01:01:50.166,"-Clara, was that your jelly? -Yes, it was, Ethel."
01:01:50.250,01:01:52.000,"-It was wonderful. -Well, thank you so much."
01:01:52.083,01:01:54.208,"-And is this Norman? -Yes, it is."
01:01:54.291,01:01:57.166,-My goodness. -We're very proud of him.
01:01:57.250,01:01:59.458,-Nice to have you back. -Thank you.
01:01:59.541,01:02:02.125,Her daughter's turned into quite a beauty.
01:02:02.916,01:02:05.833,"There she is, over there, 20 only a week ago."
01:02:05.916,01:02:07.583,"She's bright as a light, Norman."
01:02:08.541,01:02:09.500,Mother.
01:02:09.583,01:02:12.375,"Mr. Murchison, how are you?"
01:02:16.000,01:02:17.583,How are you?
01:02:17.666,01:02:20.333,"-Oh, quite well, thank you. -Good, good."
01:02:20.416,01:02:21.416,Thank you.
01:02:22.166,01:02:25.250,"-And this is Paul? -No, this is Norman."
01:02:28.791,01:02:31.291,"-Oh, you're looking good. -Yes, hasn't he grown up?"
01:02:31.375,01:02:32.916,"Oh, yes."
01:02:34.875,01:02:37.208,"Oh, Paul's here. Come on."
01:02:37.833,01:02:39.041,"Oh, I'm sorry, Mother, I can't."
01:02:39.125,01:02:41.125,I have to meet Jessie Burns' family at the station.
01:02:41.208,01:02:43.041,Her brother Neal's coming in from California.
01:02:43.125,01:02:45.791,"-Well, now. -So I'm late."
01:02:46.583,01:02:48.625,"Should we have this girl over to dinner, Norman?"
01:02:48.708,01:02:50.208,"Perhaps, Mother."
01:03:05.875,01:03:06.833,-Hello. -Howdy.
01:03:06.916,01:03:08.541,-Paul. -Mother.
01:03:19.666,01:03:20.750,"Hello, Paul."
01:03:20.833,01:03:23.750,"-Hi, Sam. Let me borrow those a moment. -Sure, why not?"
01:03:23.833,01:03:25.291,"- Hello, Father. - Son."
01:03:35.250,01:03:37.583,First shot and he bangs it right up there.
01:03:52.458,01:03:54.000,and still managed to do badly.
01:03:56.250,01:03:57.333,This is Norman.
01:03:57.416,01:04:02.958,"They were Methodists, a denomination my father always referred to as Baptists who could read."
01:04:03.041,01:04:04.083,Pop.
01:04:04.166,01:04:06.041,-Glad to know you. It's a pleasure. -My mother.
01:04:06.125,01:04:08.166,"It's really a pleasure to meet you, Norman."
01:04:08.250,01:04:09.958,Jessie tells me that you're a poet.
01:04:10.041,01:04:12.166,Are you related to the fishing newspaperman?
01:04:12.250,01:04:13.291,That's my brother.
01:04:13.375,01:04:16.458,-Jessie says you just got your degree. -Yes.
01:04:16.541,01:04:20.125,"Jessie, you know, was at the university. She was majoring in… Flapperism."
01:04:20.875,01:04:22.708,"Science, I believe. Wasn't it?"
01:04:23.416,01:04:24.708,But she dropped out.
01:04:26.500,01:04:28.791,She could learn from you. Stick-to-it-tivity.
01:04:28.875,01:04:32.333,"Now, now, just let the young man breathe. He's not used to all this."
01:04:32.416,01:04:33.708,He's a Presbyterian.
01:04:42.333,01:04:43.500,Let's go.
01:04:59.291,01:05:01.916,what a Davis Cup tennis player looked like.
01:05:02.000,01:05:04.666,-You look so good. -He looks a little thin to me.
01:05:04.750,01:05:06.833,How you doing? You look great!
01:05:06.916,01:05:08.291,You look great!
01:05:08.375,01:05:10.166,"Oh, Neal, this is Norman."
01:05:10.250,01:05:12.166,"Norman, my brother Neal."
01:05:12.250,01:05:13.458,"Hello, boy."
01:05:14.833,01:05:16.583,Did you sit up all night on that thing?
01:05:16.666,01:05:19.291,-I met some nice people on that train. -Did you get my card from Yellowstone?
01:05:19.375,01:05:21.375,-I did. I got it. -What do you think about this tie?
01:05:21.458,01:05:24.250,"Okay, come on, guys. Come on, let him breathe now. He just got here."
01:05:24.333,01:05:26.166,-Let's go eat. -That's a good idea.
01:05:26.250,01:05:31.500,"I've got some chicken salad sandwiches in the car, and I've got baking chickens at home."
01:05:31.583,01:05:33.708,"Now, Mrs. Miller has given us some cherries."
01:05:33.791,01:05:36.541,-I can make your favorite pie. -Mrs. Miller's still alive?
01:05:41.583,01:05:43.083,"Boy, it was a good year."
01:05:44.458,01:05:48.416,"Over the lips, past the gums, look out stomach, here she comes."
01:05:50.083,01:05:52.833,What's the first station out there now?
01:05:52.916,01:05:56.458,"When I traveled that way, San Berdoo was there."
01:05:56.541,01:06:03.000,"San Berdoo and a lot of sand and a lot of desert, a hell of a lot of desert."
01:06:03.083,01:06:07.541,We came back to Salt Lake City and had to change at Salt Lake City.
01:06:08.583,01:06:13.375,There was a hotel there that used to… -Served oysters. -…served oysters.
01:06:14.916,01:06:17.541,"-Yeah. -Norman, do you drink? Does he drink?"
01:06:17.625,01:06:18.625,"Oh, a little bit."
01:06:18.708,01:06:21.750,"Well, here's to the old fam-damn-ily."
01:06:42.791,01:06:44.833,"So how long do you plan to stay, Neal?"
01:06:51.041,01:06:53.833,I don't know. I miss the ocean.
01:06:54.625,01:06:55.708,What's it like?
01:06:55.791,01:06:57.833,"Oh, it's big and it's blue."
01:06:57.916,01:07:01.291,"People ride on the waves. I tell you, I was getting pretty good at it."
01:07:01.375,01:07:03.000,-Ow! -Oh.
01:07:05.666,01:07:07.125,"Jeez, Ma."
01:07:07.208,01:07:09.458,"Well, you get him so excited. Sport."
01:07:11.541,01:07:13.791,"Anywho, what was I talking about?"
01:07:13.875,01:07:15.500,-The water. -The ocean.
01:07:15.583,01:07:17.166,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:07:17.250,01:07:19.333,"So, we'd ride those waves all day long. All the boys."
01:07:19.416,01:07:21.875,"Ramon, me, Ronnie Colman."
01:07:22.416,01:07:24.041,Ronald Colman?
01:07:24.125,01:07:25.208,Ronald Colman?
01:07:27.625,01:07:29.833,"You know, people have told me I look like Ronald Colman."
01:07:31.375,01:07:32.541,Yeah.
01:07:32.625,01:07:36.125,I can't picture Ronald Colman riding on waves.
01:07:42.166,01:07:43.750,"Some Kodak, huh?"
01:07:54.666,01:07:57.416,Maybe you could go fishing with Norman sometime.
01:07:58.375,01:07:59.333,Hmm?
01:08:04.958,01:08:06.083,Yeah.
01:08:07.000,01:08:08.500,"Wonderful, wouldn't it be?"
01:08:08.583,01:08:09.875,Fishing.
01:08:10.458,01:08:11.708,You do fish?
01:08:13.666,01:08:15.083,He has a pole and everything.
01:08:15.166,01:08:16.583,"-Oh, yes, everybody does. -Oh, yeah."
01:08:16.666,01:08:17.916,You betcha.
01:08:18.791,01:08:20.666,"When would be a good time for you, Norman?"
01:08:21.250,01:08:22.333,"Oh, uh, Friday."
01:08:22.416,01:08:24.666,Friday's good. Friday's good.
01:08:24.750,01:08:26.250,"Yeah, that's… What time?"
01:08:27.541,01:08:28.750,Six.
01:08:29.291,01:08:30.333,A.M.?
01:08:34.833,01:08:37.458,"Yes, he'll be there. Won't you, honey?"
01:08:38.166,01:08:40.083,"Thank you, Norman. That's very kind of you."
01:08:40.166,01:08:41.208,"Oh, my pleasure, really."
01:08:41.291,01:08:43.333,"And maybe Paul could come, too?"
01:08:43.416,01:08:45.083,"Oh, that would be nice."
01:08:45.875,01:08:49.000,"Well, I'm sure Paul would love to go fishing with us."
01:08:49.083,01:08:51.500,"-Can I come? -Oh, no, not this time, honey."
01:09:05.958,01:09:07.791,"Why don't you go with Neal, Norman?"
01:09:07.875,01:09:10.916,"-Hmm? -You know, make your plans."
01:09:11.666,01:09:13.708,"Oh, yeah."
01:09:22.458,01:09:28.041,"which was simply an old freight car set in the woods, where any honest policeman would be unlikely to find it."
01:09:32.291,01:09:36.791,"Now, I had a hell of a time tracking them because they turn white in the winter."
01:09:39.333,01:09:43.000,"brewed by Black Jack himself, Neal began to hold forth."
01:09:43.083,01:09:47.875,"He'd chosen Montana subjects to spin his lies about shooting, hiking, trapping."
01:09:47.958,01:09:54.208,"Probably, I figured, to impress the only other client at the bar, a ploy that was beginning to pay off."
01:09:54.291,01:10:01.375,"Anywho, she tried to lose me again and again… She went by the name of Old Rawhide."
01:10:01.458,01:10:05.375,"About 10 years before, she'd been elected beauty queen of Wolf Creek."
01:10:05.458,01:10:10.208,"She had ridden bareback, standing up through the 100 inhabitants, mostly male."
01:10:10.291,01:10:13.583,"Her skirts flew high, and she won the contest."
01:10:16.708,01:10:19.291,"I'm thinking about my dog, Sport, that's with me."
01:10:19.375,01:10:25.541,"I'm thinking if it gets any colder, I just may have to slit him open and stick my hands in to keep them from freezing."
01:10:25.625,01:10:27.750,And it would have been a tough thing to do.
01:10:27.833,01:10:31.458,"But it… hell, I did it before up at the Yukon."
01:10:31.541,01:10:39.541,God knows I love that damn dog… although they must have been a hardship in her new profession.
01:10:39.625,01:10:49.333,"And there on a branch, waiting to jump on their first deer, Hey, buster."
01:10:50.583,01:10:54.125,What's an otter doing on the top of Rogers Pass?
01:10:54.833,01:10:57.416,I thought they swam down in the cricks.
01:10:59.166,01:11:02.291,"Jack, why don't you bring this lady a whiskey?"
01:11:06.916,01:11:09.458,"And don't forget, old boy. Friday, fishing."
01:11:10.458,01:11:11.458,What?
01:11:40.416,01:11:41.833,What say?
01:11:41.916,01:11:44.041,They said I'd find you at your other office.
01:11:44.625,01:11:47.291,Yeah. Deadline. Can't work there.
01:11:47.375,01:11:48.458,Hm.
01:11:50.541,01:11:51.625,You come for a drink?
01:11:53.875,01:11:55.875,Um… a favor.
01:11:57.291,01:11:58.333,Uh-oh.
01:12:02.250,01:12:03.500,Go fishing with me?
01:12:08.708,01:12:09.750,Sure.
01:12:11.208,01:12:17.750,"Well, that's marvy, because Jessie's got a brother who's in from California and, um… Ooh."
01:12:17.833,01:12:20.541,I'm not gonna lie to you. He's a world champion peckerwood.
01:12:21.166,01:12:23.583,-Bait fisherman? -He didn't say.
01:12:23.666,01:12:26.250,Good Lord. George!
01:12:26.333,01:12:28.375,He's gonna show up with a coffee can full of worms.
01:12:28.916,01:12:31.958,"Red can, Hills Brothers. I'd lay a bet on it."
01:12:39.833,01:12:41.083,Are you getting serious?
01:12:41.583,01:12:42.500,What?
01:12:42.583,01:12:44.208,"You son of a bitch, you're getting serious."
01:12:44.291,01:12:46.083,-You and Jessie. Huh? -Oh.
01:12:49.625,01:12:51.958,-Well? -I don't know.
01:12:57.666,01:12:58.958,Then I guess we got to do it.
01:13:30.500,01:13:31.666,Ah.
01:13:35.500,01:13:37.375,As I live and breathe.
01:13:37.458,01:13:39.833,Buster here wants to fish.
01:13:48.500,01:13:49.666,"You're late, Neal."
01:13:51.791,01:13:54.416,"Yeah, I didn't get in till late."
01:13:55.208,01:13:57.750,"I didn't get in at all, but I was here."
01:13:57.833,01:14:00.125,"Neal, Paul. Paul, Neal."
01:14:00.208,01:14:03.250,"Neal, in Montana there are three things we're never late for."
01:14:03.333,01:14:05.000,"Church, work and fishing."
01:14:06.333,01:14:07.500,Righty-o.
01:14:08.041,01:14:11.708,"Anywho, this is… -We've met. -We've met."
01:14:16.458,01:14:17.708,Don't go away.
01:14:29.375,01:14:32.583,Watch the first step. It's a lulu.
01:14:41.625,01:14:45.333,"So, you ready to… Neal."
01:14:47.250,01:14:49.000,-Neal! -What?
01:14:50.208,01:14:51.250,Fishing.
01:14:57.625,01:14:59.791,Buster wants to fish.
01:15:06.625,01:15:09.041,"Oh, Neal, what about the bait?"
01:15:11.583,01:15:13.041,Dumb Dora.
01:15:26.000,01:15:28.750,We're not going to catch anything anyway. It's too damn hot.
01:15:29.333,01:15:31.583,May he catch three doses of clap.
01:15:32.458,01:15:34.750,Sure glad I didn't go home and get some sleep.
01:15:39.791,01:15:40.791,Where is he?
01:15:44.500,01:15:46.291,"-Oh, God. -Jeez."
01:15:50.166,01:15:51.375,I'll catch up.
01:15:52.416,01:15:53.333,Yeah.
01:16:24.500,01:16:26.000,"I know, you got 20."
01:16:36.958,01:16:38.250,Couldn't you find him?
01:16:38.833,01:16:39.958,The hell with him.
01:16:40.708,01:16:42.500,"Well, I thought we were supposed to help him."
01:16:43.500,01:16:45.291,How the hell do you help that son of a bitch?
01:16:47.958,01:16:49.583,By taking him fishing.
01:16:51.291,01:16:52.791,He doesn't like fishing.
01:16:53.500,01:16:56.000,Doesn't like Montana. Sure as hell doesn't like me.
01:17:00.750,01:17:03.250,maybe what he likes is somebody trying to help him.
01:17:18.750,01:17:20.875,"You… You've sank the beer, yeah?"
01:17:21.833,01:17:23.125,You bet your life.
01:17:23.958,01:17:24.958,Yeah.
01:17:26.916,01:17:28.083,"Okay, let's go."
01:17:36.083,01:17:38.166,"Oh, jeez, I can taste it."
01:17:56.500,01:17:58.041,Holy Christ.
01:18:12.666,01:18:13.791,This is not good.
01:18:17.791,01:18:23.791,I don't… Love.
01:18:31.666,01:18:35.333,I can get in myself. I don't need help.
01:18:39.416,01:18:42.458,"Hey, you got anything to drink, buster?"
01:18:42.541,01:18:44.625,"Uh, buster's the one with the red ass."
01:18:58.166,01:18:59.458,I'm in deep trouble.
01:19:00.166,01:19:02.625,Yeah. You want me to come over and protect you?
01:19:02.708,01:19:05.041,"Yeah, I'm sure Mrs. Burns would love to meet the girlfriend."
01:19:05.625,01:19:07.333,I ain't burned.
01:19:07.416,01:19:09.625,The sun don't bother me.
01:19:11.958,01:19:12.875,Yeah.
01:19:14.083,01:19:17.666,"Hey, Norm, what do you think about me spending the night with you and the folks?"
01:19:17.750,01:19:21.208,"We come back here tomorrow, wipe this day off the books."
01:19:21.833,01:19:22.875,It's a deal.
01:19:23.666,01:19:26.750,"Come on, buster. I'm as dry as dirt."
01:19:27.625,01:19:29.250,"Hark, fair Juliet speaks."
01:19:32.916,01:19:34.083,Good luck.
01:19:59.250,01:20:00.666,Sweet Jesus!
01:20:02.791,01:20:04.791,What have you done to my boy?
01:20:04.875,01:20:06.291,-Don't! Ah! -Oh!
01:20:08.833,01:20:10.333,He fell asleep in the sun.
01:20:15.875,01:20:17.708,My Lord in heaven.
01:20:17.791,01:20:19.666,"It's all right. It's all right, honey."
01:20:19.750,01:20:21.958,We'll fix it. We'll fix it.
01:20:29.083,01:20:31.041,"You left him alone, Norman?"
01:20:31.625,01:20:37.333,"He was… He brought someone, and… I think you better go home."
01:20:56.625,01:20:57.750,I need a ride home.
01:21:25.958,01:21:27.250,Better hang on.
01:21:28.333,01:22:02.125,"What are you do-- I don't think you, uh… They send trains down here all the time, you know, without a schedule."
01:22:03.333,01:22:09.708,You're not… I don't think they can see us in here.
01:23:20.250,01:23:22.583,"Well, thanks for the flight."
01:23:26.750,01:23:27.916,"You know, you're funny."
01:23:29.583,01:23:30.958,"Oh, how am I funny?"
01:23:32.666,01:23:35.458,"You, uh… You don't like my brother, do you?"
01:23:40.875,01:23:42.625,"No, I do not like your brother."
01:23:47.083,01:23:50.791,"Look, I don't know any card tricks, Jess, but I like you."
01:23:52.541,01:23:53.875,And I want to see you again.
01:24:04.666,01:24:05.875,"Hello, Jess."
01:24:06.541,01:24:07.833,"Hey, Paul."
01:24:08.375,01:24:09.833,How's your brother?
01:24:09.916,01:24:12.333,"You, uh, you both left him alone."
01:24:12.416,01:24:14.916,"Well, I'm sorry about that. That was my fault."
01:24:15.708,01:24:17.416,"Well, you're not forgiven."
01:24:18.625,01:24:19.791,"Well, is Norman forgiven?"
01:24:20.791,01:24:22.333,Norman's not funny.
01:24:27.833,01:24:28.833,Ooh!
01:24:41.291,01:24:43.000,"Won’t you remember to powder my toothbrush, Mother?"
01:24:43.083,01:24:44.291,No!
01:24:44.875,01:24:47.291,"Now, let Paul tell his latest story."
01:24:47.375,01:24:50.750,"Oh, yes. Which one? The murder, the wreck, or the fire?"
01:24:50.833,01:24:53.666,I think they should put you on the church beat.
01:24:53.750,01:24:55.458,I agree. I agree.
01:24:55.541,01:24:59.750,"Quote, The Reverend Maclean had quite a nice roast while dining with his family."
01:24:59.833,01:25:04.875,"All except for the poor, elder son enjoyed it immensely."
01:25:06.125,01:25:08.958,"-Norman, what's the matter? -He's not funny."
01:25:09.041,01:25:10.125,Pardon me?
01:25:14.083,01:25:17.000,"Well, there are more important accomplishments, Norman."
01:25:17.083,01:25:19.166,"Mm-hmm. It's all right if you're dull, Norman."
01:25:21.625,01:25:23.541,We're very proud of you.
01:25:25.500,01:25:27.250,"-Yes. -Well, I do have one story."
01:25:27.333,01:25:28.791,"No murder, no mayhem."
01:25:29.541,01:25:31.708,I interviewed the President.
01:25:36.083,01:25:37.083,"Yeah, Calvin Coolidge."
01:25:37.166,01:25:38.750,-Mr. Coolidge? -Yeah. Uh-huh.
01:25:38.833,01:25:40.166,-When? -A few days ago.
01:25:40.250,01:25:42.541,"He was over in Dakota, fly-fishing."
01:25:43.083,01:25:44.333,Fly-fishing!
01:25:44.416,01:25:47.750,"Fly-fishing in a suit and tie, white gloves and patent leather shoes."
01:25:49.500,01:25:54.791,"So I asked him… I went right up to him. I said, Excuse me, sir, can you tell me what they're biting on?"
01:25:54.875,01:25:57.375,"He turns around, looks at me and says, The end of my line."
01:25:59.666,01:26:00.750,The end of my line.
01:26:04.375,01:26:08.583,"Then a bunch of the locals came running over, tied on some new-fangled fly the size of a chicken."
01:26:08.666,01:26:10.875,"Old Cal, he heaves it out there."
01:26:11.375,01:26:14.500,"Figured if he can't catch a trout, by God, he's gonna scare one to death."
01:26:18.833,01:26:19.875,Did you get a picture?
01:26:19.958,01:26:21.833,"Oh, yeah. Be in the Sunday paper."
01:26:21.916,01:26:24.500,Closed-mouth Cal communes with the crappies.
01:26:33.958,01:26:35.250,"Mother, that was amazing."
01:26:35.833,01:26:38.041,"Yeah, he usually only eats what he can hit on the road."
01:26:39.125,01:26:40.250,Now that was funny.
01:26:41.166,01:26:45.000,"-You know, I do worry about you, Paul. -I think I'm going to run over and-- Hm?"
01:26:45.083,01:26:46.083,What?
01:26:47.666,01:26:48.541,What?
01:26:50.208,01:26:57.250,"Oh, I was just going to say, thought I'd go out and meet some of the old pals, being in town and all."
01:27:01.708,01:27:02.958,"Now, don't you wait up."
01:27:03.500,01:27:06.083,I plan on eating the rest of this when nobody's looking.
01:27:37.625,01:27:40.291,I understand he's changed the spelling of our name.
01:27:42.333,01:27:44.583,"MacLean, with a capital L."
01:27:47.458,01:27:49.958,Now everyone will think we're Lowland Scots.
01:28:06.250,01:28:07.750,"Howdy, Norman."
01:28:09.958,01:28:11.666,"Hi there, Mr. Sweeney."
01:28:12.583,01:28:15.750,Who do you know at the University of Chicago?
01:28:18.458,01:28:23.583,"Chicken in the car, car won't go. That's how you spell Chicago."
01:28:39.916,01:28:53.208,"and cometh from afar, not in entire forgetfulness and not in utter nakedness, but trailing clouds of glory do we come from God, who is our home."
01:28:53.291,01:29:00.083,"Though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower, we will grieve not."
01:29:00.625,01:29:03.958,Rather find strength in what remains behind.
01:29:04.875,01:29:08.125,In the primal sympathy which having been must ever be.
01:29:08.208,01:29:11.333,In the soothing thoughts that spring out of human suffering.
01:29:12.125,01:29:14.208,In the faith that looks through death.
01:29:14.750,01:29:17.416,Thanks to the human heart by which we live.
01:29:17.916,01:29:21.416,"Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, its fears."
01:29:22.833,01:29:37.916,"To me the meanest flower that blows… Good luck, Son."
01:29:38.000,01:29:40.416,-We'll be rooting for you. -There's sandwiches in here.
01:29:44.500,01:29:49.833,She called to tell me that Neal was going back to California and that he would appreciate me seeing him off.
01:29:49.916,01:29:51.208,"We love you, dear. We love you."
01:29:51.291,01:29:52.666,We love you. Good luck.
01:29:56.541,01:29:58.500,I asked only one question of Jessie.
01:29:58.583,01:30:01.833,Did she want me to come? And she answered yes.
01:30:02.458,01:30:04.708,I love you. Don't forget to write.
01:30:51.291,01:30:53.000,"Well, he's not coming back."
01:30:53.958,01:30:55.500,At least he's got friends out there.
01:30:56.875,01:30:58.583,"Who, Ronald Colman?"
01:31:08.166,01:31:13.291,Why is it the people who need the most help won't take it?
01:31:16.250,01:31:17.333,"I don't know, Jess."
01:31:24.833,01:31:29.250,"God. I don't… I don't cry, Norman."
01:31:45.916,01:31:47.250,Can I show you something?
01:31:56.166,01:31:57.583,Read.
01:32:07.666,01:32:08.833,So what do you think?
01:32:09.333,01:32:12.916,What do I think? I think it's the berries!
01:32:13.000,01:32:16.666,"-You do? -Yeah, to get away! Chicago!"
01:32:16.750,01:32:18.125,"God, it's heaven."
01:32:18.708,01:32:21.083,"-Have you ever been? -No, no. Not anywhere."
01:32:25.333,01:32:27.500,"God. Congratulations, Norman."
01:32:30.041,01:32:32.083,"Truth is, I'm not sure I want to leave."
01:32:33.291,01:32:37.125,Montana? Why? It'll always be here.
01:32:37.208,01:32:38.708,Not Montana.
01:32:38.791,01:32:40.041,Then what?
01:32:42.000,01:32:43.041,What?
01:32:45.416,01:32:47.041,I'm not sure I want to leave you.
01:33:11.791,01:33:13.458,"Little do they know, I just come from there."
01:33:13.541,01:33:16.041,"Dining my liquid lunch. You gotta watch it, Fred."
01:33:16.125,01:33:22.291,"-I'm telling you, they're after you. -You got it right… Well, now."
01:33:26.791,01:33:28.916,"Give us a couple boilermakers, Fred."
01:33:44.458,01:33:48.083,"Well, here's to the heart, God damn it."
01:33:48.583,01:33:49.958,"Oh, Lordy."
01:34:08.166,01:34:10.250,I'm in love with Jessie Burns.
01:34:13.541,01:34:15.541,"Jesus Christ, Norm."
01:34:15.625,01:34:17.291,With all the fish in the river?
01:34:17.833,01:34:19.166,Not like her.
01:34:20.291,01:34:21.708,"Oh, right."
01:34:22.833,01:34:24.208,Not like her.
01:34:27.250,01:34:28.625,Congratulations.
01:34:30.500,01:34:31.750,I'm real happy for you.
01:34:35.500,01:34:38.416,"Well, Goddamn it, let's get the hell out of here and go celebrate."
01:34:39.750,01:34:40.666,Done.
01:34:47.291,01:34:48.708,It's a stinker.
01:34:48.791,01:34:50.250,What?
01:34:50.333,01:34:51.708,It stinks.
01:34:52.375,01:34:54.458,What do you mean? It's a classic!
01:34:54.541,01:34:56.000,"Oh, really?"
01:34:59.500,01:35:00.541,Yes.
01:35:08.875,01:35:09.958,Where are we?
01:35:11.791,01:35:12.791,Where we going?
01:35:25.458,01:35:26.458,No.
01:35:32.166,01:35:34.083,Figured you felt lucky tonight.
01:35:34.625,01:35:36.458,I could use some of the luck.
01:35:44.041,01:35:46.500,"Jesus Christ. Don't. No, don't."
01:35:46.583,01:35:48.458,Don't be the professor tonight.
01:35:49.750,01:35:52.666,Norm. Preacher.
01:36:42.333,01:36:44.083,"Well, my gal Sal."
01:37:12.333,01:37:14.166,"Sal! Hey, Sal?"
01:37:16.208,01:37:17.833,Get a drink for my brother.
01:37:18.500,01:37:19.416,Bourbon.
01:37:20.583,01:37:23.416,"In fact, how about a round on me?"
01:37:24.250,01:37:25.500,He's in love.
01:37:36.708,01:37:38.041,Hang on.
01:37:39.208,01:37:40.625,"Take care of him, Sal."
01:37:54.500,01:37:57.041,"Fellas, got a chair for me? Uh-oh."
01:37:57.125,01:37:58.583,"Not for you, Paul."
01:37:58.666,01:38:00.208,Now you know I'm good for it.
01:38:04.791,01:38:05.833,What do you want?
01:38:06.750,01:38:07.791,What?
01:38:08.916,01:38:11.500,Cards? What?
01:38:14.125,01:38:15.166,What do you want?
01:38:16.791,01:38:17.750,Nothing.
01:38:20.166,01:38:29.083,"A buck. I know Paul says he's paying, but… Okay, okay, okay."
01:38:29.750,01:38:30.916,"No, no."
01:38:31.666,01:38:33.208,No. Just games.
01:38:34.208,01:38:35.416,Only games.
01:38:35.500,01:38:37.416,Let's go. Now.
01:38:39.041,01:38:40.833,"Come on, we're getting out of here."
01:38:41.333,01:38:42.916,Righty-oh-ho-ho.
01:39:05.083,01:39:06.208,I'm not leaving.
01:39:07.375,01:39:08.291,What?
01:39:09.375,01:39:11.625,"These hands are hot, Norm. I can feel it."
01:39:12.125,01:39:14.583,What are you talking about? You can't go back in there.
01:39:15.416,01:39:18.041,"Norm, it's fine. I'll be fine."
01:39:18.125,01:39:19.958,They won't even let you play.
01:39:20.041,01:39:21.750,"Oh, yes, they will."
01:39:22.375,01:39:25.208,With what? You are in debt up to your goddamn neck.
01:39:25.708,01:39:27.875,"Norm, it's my debt."
01:39:29.916,01:39:31.291,Okay? It's my debt.
01:39:35.500,01:39:37.291,Jesus Christ.
01:39:59.583,01:40:00.666,"Hey, Norm!"
01:40:01.500,01:40:02.625,Norm.
01:40:05.166,01:40:06.250,Hey.
01:40:07.333,01:40:10.000,I was thinking. We never got to go fishing again.
01:40:10.083,01:40:11.458,Maybe we could go tomorrow.
01:40:12.166,01:40:13.958,And we could get Dad to come along.
01:40:15.041,01:40:16.000,Okay?
01:40:17.666,01:40:18.750,You ask him.
01:40:22.375,01:40:23.458,Okay.
01:40:25.791,01:40:26.916,Six thirty.
01:41:20.208,01:41:22.916,"Boy, something smells good out there. Morning, everybody."
01:41:24.791,01:41:25.666,Perfect!
01:41:26.791,01:41:29.541,"We're so glad you could make it, what with work and everything."
01:41:29.625,01:41:30.708,I wouldn't miss it.
01:41:33.791,01:41:36.750,A story? Hmm… All righty.
01:41:37.958,01:41:39.291,"Oh, jeez."
01:41:42.291,01:41:43.375,I have one.
01:41:47.166,01:41:48.291,What?
01:41:49.666,01:41:52.125,I've been offered a job at the University of Chicago.
01:41:53.375,01:41:54.458,Yes?
01:41:55.833,01:41:57.125,Teaching literature.
01:41:58.833,01:41:59.875,What?
01:41:59.958,01:42:01.666,Starting fall term.
01:42:06.083,01:42:07.333,I'm going to take it.
01:42:16.666,01:42:18.291,I am pleased.
01:42:20.166,01:42:23.000,"Yes, I am pleased."
01:42:27.625,01:42:28.541,A professor.
01:42:32.916,01:42:34.333,A real professor.
01:42:35.500,01:42:36.750,Damnation.
01:42:41.458,01:42:42.583,I'm proud of you.
01:42:57.166,01:42:59.333,"Now, you be sure to take pictures."
01:43:02.458,01:43:03.875,We're gonna catch some big fish.
01:43:03.958,01:43:05.000,"Yes, we are."
01:43:05.083,01:43:06.291,Let's go!
01:43:21.125,01:43:22.541,Those were big rocks.
01:43:22.625,01:43:24.875,Yeah. Nearly a billion years old.
01:43:24.958,01:43:26.625,"Half a billion, Norman."
01:43:27.333,01:43:28.583,Come on.
01:43:31.833,01:43:37.750,"Well, I believe the high road will suit me better."
01:43:39.541,01:43:40.625,Oh.
01:43:41.333,01:43:42.375,True.
01:43:44.916,01:43:46.083,There was a time.
01:43:47.333,01:43:48.791,You'll make a killing.
01:43:53.458,01:43:54.791,He'll make a killing.
01:43:56.416,01:43:58.250,Let's fish together today.
01:43:58.333,01:43:59.291,Good.
01:46:02.666,01:46:03.875,What?
01:46:07.583,01:46:08.708,Louder!
01:46:10.541,01:46:15.833,I said… Bunyan Bugs!
01:46:19.875,01:46:21.333,Want me to bring you one?
01:46:21.875,01:46:24.833,"No, I'll come and get it."
01:46:39.250,01:46:41.541,"Bunyan Bug, stonefly number two."
01:46:42.666,01:46:45.750,"Thank you, O merciful professor of poetry and trout."
01:47:13.708,01:47:15.416,I'm going to ask Jessie to marry me.
01:47:18.958,01:47:20.125,Yes.
01:47:23.125,01:47:24.375,Quite a day.
01:47:34.500,01:47:36.458,Why don't you come with us to Chicago?
01:47:43.125,01:47:44.500,"It's 2,000 miles away."
01:47:44.583,01:47:46.583,They've gotta have more than a dozen papers there.
01:47:48.833,01:47:50.375,You'd be right in the middle of things.
01:47:52.041,01:47:53.208,What do you say?
01:47:55.041,01:47:56.125,Come with us.
01:48:00.166,01:48:02.583,"Oh, I'll never leave Montana, Brother."
01:51:25.083,01:51:26.833,"Oh, me. Oh, my."
01:51:27.458,01:51:29.250,Look at that fish!
01:51:32.958,01:51:33.916,Woo!
01:51:34.416,01:51:35.958,Unbelievable.
01:51:41.541,01:51:43.583,that I was witnessing perfection.
01:51:45.833,01:51:49.166,You… You are a fine fisherman.
01:51:50.416,01:51:53.208,Only need three more years before I can think like a fish.
01:51:53.708,01:51:55.458,You're already thinking like a dead stonefly.
01:51:55.958,01:51:58.250,"-Here, pictures. -Mother's pictures."
01:51:58.333,01:51:59.666,-Hurry up. -One.
01:52:02.083,01:52:03.166,Two.
01:52:04.958,01:52:12.666,"not on a bank of the Big Blackfoot River, but suspended above the earth, free from all its laws like a work of art."
01:52:13.958,01:52:14.916,Three.
01:52:29.208,01:52:37.250,And I knew just as surely and just as clearly that life is not a work of art and that the moment could not last.
01:52:53.375,01:53:00.250,"And so when the police sergeant awakened me one morning just before Jessie and I left for Chicago, I rose and asked no questions."
01:53:31.041,01:53:42.083,He drove me back home down the length of the river so that I could tell my father and mother that Paul had been beaten to death by the butt of a revolver and his body dumped in an alley.
01:54:24.666,01:54:26.833,Is there anything else you can tell me?
01:54:32.416,01:54:34.875,Nearly all the bones in his hand were broken.
01:54:54.458,01:54:55.916,Which hand?
01:54:59.208,01:55:00.458,His right hand.
01:55:39.500,01:55:42.666,asking me again and again had I told him everything.
01:55:43.666,01:55:50.250,"And finally I said to him, Maybe all I really know about Paul is that he was a fine fisherman."
01:55:51.333,01:55:55.541,"You know more than that, my father said. He was beautiful."
01:55:57.541,01:56:00.625,And that was the last time we ever spoke of my brother's death.
01:56:12.500,01:56:16.166,"Indirectly, though, Paul was always present in my father's thoughts."
01:56:17.041,01:56:20.916,"I remember the last sermon I heard him give, not long before his own death."
01:56:26.666,01:56:31.458,look upon a loved one who is in need and ask the same question.
01:56:32.583,01:56:37.375,"We are willing to help, Lord, but what, if anything, is needed?"
01:56:39.375,01:56:42.500,For it is true we can seldom help those closest to us.
01:56:43.083,01:56:51.541,"Either we don't know what part of ourselves to give, or, more often than not, the part we have to give is not wanted."
01:56:53.541,01:57:02.708,"And so it is those we live with and should know who elude us, but we can still love them."
01:57:04.541,01:57:09.125,We can love completely without complete understanding.
01:57:50.625,01:57:54.250,"and did not understand in my youth are dead, even Jessie."
01:57:55.458,01:57:57.125,But I still reach out to them.
01:58:09.416,01:58:17.750,"Of course, now I'm too old to be much of a fisherman, and now I usually fish the big waters alone, although some friends think I shouldn't."
01:58:26.666,01:58:41.958,"But when I am alone in the half-light of the canyon, all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul and memories, and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River, and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise."
01:58:55.958,01:59:03.583,"Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it."
01:59:10.916,01:59:16.875,The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time.
01:59:18.166,01:59:20.833,On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops.
01:59:22.375,01:59:28.083,"Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs."
01:59:37.833,01:59:39.541,I am haunted by waters.
