00:00:45.713,00:00:51.218,Have you ever felt like you were a little bit different?
00:00:51.218,00:00:58.600,"Like you had something unique to offer the world, if you could just get people to see it."
00:00:58.600,00:01:05.399,Then you know exactly how it felt to be me.
00:01:05.399,00:01:06.775,"WOMAN: Go ahead, Flint."
00:01:08.443,00:01:13.699,What is the number one problem facing our community today?
00:01:13.699,00:01:15.283,Untied shoelaces.
00:01:15.283,00:01:20.956,Which is why I've invented a laceless alternative foot covering.

00:01:26.921,00:01:28.047,Voil√†.
00:01:28.047,00:01:29.798,They're so nifty.
00:01:29.798,00:01:32.051,"How you gonna get them off, nerd?"
00:01:36.263,00:01:37.472,What a freak.
00:01:37.472,00:01:39.934,"He wants to be smart, but that's lame."
00:01:45.814,00:01:48.567,I wanted to run away that day.
00:01:48.567,00:01:52.947,But you can't run away from your own feet.
00:01:58.702,00:02:01.080,Oh.
00:02:02.497,00:02:05.208,"Not every sardine is meant to swim, son."
00:02:05.208,00:02:08.754,I don't understand fishing metaphors.
00:02:08.754,00:02:09.838,DAD: What did I say?
00:02:09.838,00:02:11.214,MOM: Don't worry.
00:02:12.841,00:02:17.137,"Honey, I think your shoes are wonderful."
00:02:17.137,00:02:19.681,Everyone just thinks I'm a weirdo.
00:02:19.681,00:02:21.100,So?
00:02:21.100,00:02:25.562,People probably thought that these guys were weirdoes too.
00:02:25.562,00:02:27.564,But that never stopped them.
00:02:27.564,00:02:32.444,"I was saving this for your birthday, but here."
00:02:32.444,00:02:35.155,A professional-grade lab coat.
00:02:35.155,00:02:37.157,Just like the real guys wear.
00:02:39.326,00:02:40.828,It fits perfect.
00:02:40.828,00:02:44.039,"The world needs your originality, Flint."
00:02:44.039,00:02:47.793,You just have to grow into it.
00:02:47.793,00:02:51.546,And I know that you're gonna do big things someday.
00:03:15.029,00:03:20.283,From that moment on I was determined to invent something great.
00:03:20.283,00:03:23.162,Remote Control Television.
00:03:24.245,00:03:27.499,And the pitch is in.
00:03:27.499,00:03:29.208,Eventually.

00:03:40.804,00:03:44.850,"No, Steve. No, no, no, no, no!"
00:03:40.804,00:03:45.893,"No, please! Leave it-- Ah!"
00:03:45.893,00:03:47.394,Ratbirds.
00:03:47.394,00:03:49.730,"Hey, what's going on, little guy?"

00:03:52.691,00:04:03.535,"FLINT: My dream was to help my hometown, a tiny island hidden under the A in Atlantic, called Swallow Falls."
00:04:03.535,00:04:16.297,We were famous for sardines until the day the Baby Brent Sardine Cannery closed for good right after everyone in the world realized that sardines are super gross.
00:04:16.297,00:04:22.721,"Soon, all of us were stuck eating the sardines that no one else wanted."
00:04:22.721,00:04:29.103,"Poached, fried, boiled, dried, candied and juiced."
00:04:29.103,00:04:32.564,Life became gray and flavorless.
00:04:32.564,00:04:39.196,"But when all seemed lost, I stared at defeat and found hope."
00:05:07.224,00:05:09.810,My name is Flint Lockwood.
00:05:09.810,00:05:18.359,And I was about to invent a machine that turns water into food.
00:05:18.359,00:05:22.781,"Steve, my best friend and trusted colleague."
00:05:22.781,00:05:24.116,COMPUTER VOICE: Steve.
00:05:24.116,00:05:26.994,Can I count on your help?
00:05:29.121,00:05:30.413,Can.
00:05:31.581,00:05:33.292,I knew I could.
00:05:33.292,00:05:36.003,"Button, on."
00:05:36.003,00:05:40.548,"Blueprints, awesome."

00:06:24.843,00:06:27.971,Everyone is going to love this.
00:06:54.539,00:06:55.916,TIM: Flint!
00:06:55.916,00:06:57.667,"FLINT: Sorry, Dad."
00:06:57.667,00:07:00.128,"Steve, keep working."
00:07:03.006,00:07:05.092,Scanning hand.
00:07:23.193,00:07:25.195,That's a really weird dude.

00:07:37.749,00:07:40.294,"Jeez. See you, Dad."
00:07:41.544,00:07:43.088,Flint.
00:07:43.088,00:07:44.756,Um...
00:07:45.882,00:07:52.431,"Um, mm, don't you think it's time to give up this inventing thing, get a real job?"
00:07:52.431,00:07:54.391,"No, why?"
00:07:54.391,00:07:59.062,"Well, all your technology stuff, it just ends in disaster."
00:07:59.062,00:08:02.023,"The ratbirds, yes, they escaped and bred at a surprising rate."
00:08:02.023,00:08:04.859,But I took care of that problem and disposed of them.
00:08:04.859,00:08:06.820,"BOY: Billy, just play dead."
00:08:06.820,00:08:11.992,"Flint, you don't keep throwing your net where there aren't any fish."
00:08:11.992,00:08:14.202,I want you to work full-time at the tackle shop.
00:08:14.202,00:08:16.079,"The tackle shop? Aw, Dad, no."
00:08:16.079,00:08:17.914,Tackle is a good career.
00:08:17.914,00:08:19.624,"Please, I'm so close with this one."
00:08:19.624,00:08:23.920,I just have to hook it up to the power station and give it more power and it'll work.
00:08:23.920,00:08:29.134,And-- And then you could sell food in the shop and then everyone won't have to eat sardines anymore.
00:08:29.134,00:08:32.971,It is going to be so awesome.
00:08:32.971,00:08:34.639,"I'm sorry, son."
00:08:34.639,00:08:35.682,Ouch.
00:08:35.682,00:08:37.058,No more inventing.
00:08:37.058,00:08:40.270,"Dad, I know I can do this."
00:08:40.270,00:08:41.688,And Mom did too.
00:08:43.523,00:08:50.864,FLINT: It had been almost 10 years since Mom died and Dad still didn't understand me like she did.
00:08:50.864,00:08:54.575,Come on.
00:08:57.120,00:09:00.290,Tim and Son Sardine Bait and Tackle.

00:09:03.335,00:09:04.461,Mm-hm.
00:09:06.671,00:09:09.674,"Look out, Baby Brent!"
00:09:09.674,00:09:11.510,Uh-oh.

00:09:13.178,00:09:16.139,WOMAN: Hand-packed in Swallow Falls.
00:09:16.139,00:09:23.563,"As your mayor, I know it's time to put our sardine-canning past behind us and look to the future."
00:09:23.563,00:09:26.858,Sardine tourism!
00:09:26.858,00:09:37.536,"That's why, without consulting anyone, I spent the entire town budget on the thing that is under this tarp which I will be unveiling today at noon."
00:09:37.536,00:09:41.373,Featuring a live appearance by Baby Brent himself.
00:09:42.499,00:09:45.960,"What is up, everybody?"
00:09:45.960,00:09:47.670,Hey.
00:09:47.670,00:09:49.047,What you doing?
00:09:49.047,00:09:51.299,Stacking cans with me on them as a baby?
00:09:51.299,00:09:52.342,Uh-oh.
00:09:54.594,00:09:58.890,"Anyways, who wants to watch me cut the ribbon at the mayor's unveiling thing?"
00:09:58.890,00:10:02.852,I'll be using these bad boys to help save the town.
00:10:02.852,00:10:05.188,Boo-yow!
00:10:05.188,00:10:08.233,"All right, you guys."
00:10:08.233,00:10:10.068,Swallow Falls forever!
00:10:10.068,00:10:11.278,What a delight.
00:10:11.278,00:10:16.241,"Listen, you, maybe you wanna go to that unveiling?"
00:10:16.241,00:10:17.825,"You know, Dad, why don't you go ahead."
00:10:17.825,00:10:19.911,"I'll, uh-- I'll hold down the fort here."
00:10:19.911,00:10:23.457,Really?
00:10:23.457,00:10:25.959,"Heh-heh-heh. Yeah, Dad, I'm pretty sure I'll be fine."
00:10:25.959,00:10:27.294,"Heh. All right, then."
00:10:27.294,00:10:30.797,"I'll be back in half an hour, skipper."
00:10:30.797,00:10:33.216,Okay. Bye.
00:10:40.765,00:10:43.435,"This hellhole is too small for me, Brent."
00:10:43.435,00:10:45.479,I wanna be big.
00:10:45.479,00:10:50.191,"I want people to look at me and say, That is one big mayor."
00:10:50.191,00:10:52.193,And that's why this has to work.
00:10:52.193,00:10:53.987,It has to work.
00:10:53.987,00:11:01.202,"Otherwise, I'm just a tiny mayor of a tiny town full of tiny sardine-sucking knuckle-scrapers."
00:11:01.202,00:11:02.912,"But not me, right?"
00:11:02.912,00:11:04.664,"Oh, not you, Brent."
00:11:04.664,00:11:08.168,You've always been like a son to me.
00:11:10.420,00:11:12.506,"Hey, hey, everybody."
00:11:14.090,00:11:19.012,Under this tarp is the greatest tourist attraction ever built by humans.
00:11:19.012,00:11:21.764,"We just need 17,000 more gigajoules."
00:11:21.764,00:11:24.559,MAYOR: An attraction so...
00:11:26.520,00:11:28.605,"What are you doing, Flint Lockwood?"
00:11:28.605,00:11:31.024,"Just holding my hands behind my back respectfully, sir."
00:11:31.024,00:11:32.817,"You know what you are, Flint Lockwood?"
00:11:32.817,00:11:34.861,No.
00:11:34.861,00:11:36.737,A tomfool.
00:11:36.737,00:11:38.657,You see my beautiful angel son Cal?
00:11:38.657,00:11:39.991,What's up?
00:11:39.991,00:11:41.993,I love him so much.
00:11:41.993,00:11:43.828,I want him to have a bright future.
00:11:43.828,00:11:48.625,A future in which you don't ruin our town's day with one of your crazy science doodley-bopper thingies.
00:11:48.625,00:11:52.086,"Well, that's all behind me-- You see this contact lens, Lockwood?"
00:11:52.086,00:11:54.130,This contact lens represent you.
00:11:54.130,00:11:56.591,And my eye represents my eye.
00:11:56.591,00:12:01.221,I got my eye on you.
00:12:01.221,00:12:03.097,"Oh, my gosh, a jaywalker."
00:12:03.097,00:12:05.308,Hey.
00:12:05.308,00:12:13.149,And I've arranged for live coverage from a major network and their most experienced professional reporter.
00:12:13.149,00:12:15.193,"WOMAN: Oh, just send the intern."
00:12:15.193,00:12:17.487,"She's cute, and she's super perky."
00:12:17.487,00:12:21.782,"Well, those are the only things we look for in a TV weatherperson."
00:12:21.782,00:12:27.955,How would you like to do a weather report from a rinky-dink island in the middle of the ocean as a favor to my cousin?
00:12:27.955,00:12:29.165,Really?
00:12:29.165,00:12:30.625,"Can you believe it, Manny?"
00:12:30.625,00:12:33.794,Temporary professional meteorologist.
00:12:33.794,00:12:34.879,Whoo!
00:12:34.879,00:12:36.590,"Okay, Manny, what about this?"
00:12:36.590,00:12:38.717,"Welcome, America, I'm Sam Sparks."
00:12:38.717,00:12:41.094,"Hello, America, Sam Sparks here."
00:12:41.094,00:12:43.430,"America, hi."
00:12:43.430,00:12:44.931,"It's me, Sam Sparks."
00:12:44.931,00:12:49.436,On my way across the ocean.
00:12:49.436,00:12:54.691,"MAYOR: Now, when she gets here, I wanna see a lot of smiling faces."
00:12:54.691,00:12:56.526,"Act like, Hey..."
00:12:56.526,00:13:00.488,This is a great idea.
00:13:01.364,00:13:10.123,MAN: Now we're over to Swallow Falls where our intern is on her first day on the job.
00:13:10.123,00:13:13.000,"Or should I say, first gray on the job."
00:13:13.000,00:13:14.753,"Looks pretty cloudy there, intern."
00:13:14.753,00:13:16.795,"Hello, Sam Sparks, I'm America."
00:13:16.795,00:13:22.260,"It's Swallow Falls degrees and-- Well, let's just go to the mayor."
00:13:22.260,00:13:26.805,"Thank you and welcome, national television audience."
00:13:26.805,00:13:31.645,You are about to witness an historic event...
00:13:34.773,00:13:43.740,"And now, here to cut the ceremonial ribbon, Swallow Falls' favorite son, Baby Brent!"
00:13:43.740,00:13:45.241,"He's still got it, folks."
00:13:45.241,00:13:46.576,Yeah!
00:13:48.495,00:13:52.081,I'm the best person in the whole town.
00:13:52.081,00:13:54.083,Uh-oh.
00:13:57.420,00:14:00.548,"Food synthesis, go."
00:14:02.342,00:14:05.637,My chest hairs are tingling.
00:14:07.013,00:14:10.183,"Well, here it is."
00:14:07.013,00:14:14.895,The attraction the whole world has been waiting for: Sardine Land.
00:14:17.023,00:14:19.150,With rides and exhibits.
00:14:19.150,00:14:26.199,"And featuring Shamo, the world's largest sardine and his flaming hoop of glory."
00:14:27.534,00:14:30.787,"Those of you in the splash zone, look out."
00:14:30.787,00:14:32.079,Yeah!

00:14:40.963,00:14:42.256,Flint Lockwood.
00:14:42.256,00:14:45.635,Just a second.
00:14:42.256,00:14:59.357,"I'm in the middle of a-- Well, looks like things in Swallow Falls are sardine to get better."
00:14:56.437,00:15:02.235,For-- What just happened to me?
00:15:02.235,00:15:03.528,Agh! Sorry.
00:15:24.924,00:15:27.134,No.
00:15:27.134,00:15:29.554,"You're under arrest, Flint Lockwood."
00:15:29.554,00:15:33.767,Thank goodness you only caused minimal damage to Sardine Land.
00:15:39.980,00:15:41.148,Come on.
00:15:50.157,00:15:53.202,I really shouldn't be running with these.
00:15:55.955,00:15:59.292,"Jump, jump, jump, run, run, jump, jump, run."
00:16:08.760,00:16:10.052,Yippee!
00:16:17.310,00:16:19.896,"Ay, papi."
00:16:19.896,00:16:22.315,It's a good thing no one got hurt!
00:16:22.315,00:16:23.524,Flint Lockwood!
00:16:23.524,00:16:27.612,"I didn't get hurt, but that does not mean that I'm not still mad at you."
00:17:33.344,00:17:35.847,"Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry."
00:17:35.847,00:17:38.599,"I didn't get a chance to-- It's okay, it's just pain."
00:17:38.599,00:17:40.518,"Sorry, I am not myself today."
00:17:40.518,00:17:46.024,My whole career was ruined by some crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket.
00:17:46.024,00:17:47.942,Wait a minute.
00:17:47.942,00:17:50.778,What is going on with your feet?
00:17:50.778,00:17:53.781,Spray-On Shoes.
00:17:53.781,00:17:55.241,Cool.
00:17:55.241,00:17:57.827,This could solve the untied shoes epidemic.
00:17:57.827,00:18:01.455,"What are they made of, some kind of elastic biopolymer adhesive?"
00:18:01.455,00:18:03.082,Yeah.
00:18:03.082,00:18:04.250,Exactly.
00:18:04.250,00:18:05.292,I mean.
00:18:06.419,00:18:09.839,"Wow, they're shiny. I'm Sam."
00:18:09.839,00:18:12.050,Oh! Flint.
00:18:12.050,00:18:14.260,Is that a Monkey Thought Translator?
00:18:14.260,00:18:15.344,Steve.
00:18:15.344,00:18:17.471,SAM: Ha!
00:18:17.471,00:18:21.267,Incredible.
00:18:21.267,00:18:22.393,You hit me with a rocket.
00:18:22.393,00:18:24.144,You kicked me in the face.
00:18:24.144,00:18:25.145,I said I was sorry.
00:18:25.145,00:18:27.398,Oh!
00:18:27.398,00:18:30.526,Do you know how hard it is to break into the weather game?
00:18:30.526,00:18:34.405,I spent my entire life building up to that moment.
00:18:34.405,00:18:37.366,You get one shot at the show.
00:18:37.366,00:18:43.330,"And if you don't make it, it's back to cleaning the barometers."
00:18:49.462,00:18:51.130,Cheese?
00:18:53.841,00:18:56.176,Oh!
00:18:56.176,00:18:59.722,But that could only mean...
00:19:46.936,00:19:50.272,Excited.
00:20:00.282,00:20:02.035,My machine works.
00:20:03.744,00:20:08.041,It really works!
00:20:10.668,00:20:12.628,Your machine?
00:20:12.628,00:20:14.463,Is that what that rocket was?
00:20:14.463,00:20:16.549,"Uh, do you like it?"
00:20:17.842,00:20:19.010,I love it!
00:20:19.010,00:20:21.595,This is just amazing.
00:20:21.595,00:20:24.891,This is the greatest weather phenomenon in history.
00:20:24.891,00:20:27.060,"Hey, aren't you a weathergirl?"
00:20:29.145,00:20:31.939,"Manny, get your camera!"
00:20:47.246,00:20:51.000,This just in: Our humiliated weather intern is apparently back for more.
00:20:51.000,00:20:52.668,"Thanks, Patrick."
00:20:52.668,00:20:59.341,"Okay, everybody, you are not gonna believe this one, but I am standing in the middle of a burger rain."
00:20:59.341,00:21:05.765,"You may have seen a meteor shower, but you've never seen a shower meatier than this."
00:21:05.765,00:21:09.936,"For a town stuck eating sardines, this is totally manna from heaven."
00:21:09.936,00:21:13.272,MAN: This tastes significantly better than sardines.
00:21:16.358,00:21:17.693,"Mmm, mmm, mmm."
00:21:20.113,00:21:22.656,This is going to be big.
00:21:22.656,00:21:28.579,SAM: This food weather was created intentionally by meek-ish backyard tinkerer Flint Lockwood.
00:21:28.579,00:21:30.623,Flint Lockwood?
00:21:30.623,00:21:32.041,Hi.
00:21:32.041,00:21:34.168,You're under arrest for ruining Sardine Land.
00:21:34.168,00:21:35.711,"Flint, those burgers were awesome."
00:21:35.711,00:21:39.298,"The producer called and he was like, Everybody loves that food weather."
00:21:39.298,00:21:40.800,Food weather.
00:21:40.800,00:21:42.760,This could be even bigger than Sardine Land.
00:21:42.760,00:21:44.678,Can you make it rain food again?
00:21:44.678,00:21:47.098,I don't know if I-- You're gonna do it again?
00:21:47.098,00:21:48.599,You gotta be kidding.
00:21:48.599,00:21:51.018,"Please, please, please."
00:21:53.729,00:21:54.855,Yes.
00:21:54.855,00:21:56.190,No.
00:21:56.190,00:21:57.191,Give me one more chance.
00:21:57.191,00:21:58.525,We know this was an accident.
00:21:58.525,00:22:02.155,"I know but-- Cheeseburgers from the sky, that's not natural."
00:22:02.155,00:22:05.491,My invention could save the whole town.
00:22:05.491,00:22:08.286,"You will be so proud of me, Dad."
00:22:08.286,00:22:11.789,"Plus, there's a girl here."
00:22:13.874,00:22:20.214,Can you look me in the eye and tell me you've got this under control and it's not gonna end up in a disaster?
00:22:20.214,00:22:22.216,Yes.
00:22:36.772,00:22:40.318,"I've got this under control, and it's not gonna end in disaster."
00:22:42.111,00:22:43.237,All right.
00:22:43.237,00:22:44.362,"Thanks, Dad."
00:22:44.362,00:22:45.572,"Oh, sure."
00:22:45.572,00:22:51.204,"Okay. So Sam, this is where the magic happens."
00:22:52.788,00:22:56.667,Lick. Lick. Lick.
00:22:56.667,00:23:01.172,Lick. Lick. Lick.
00:23:01.172,00:23:03.007,"FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: Welcome, Flint."
00:23:03.007,00:23:07.970,"Wow, you seriously spend a lot of time alone."
00:23:07.970,00:23:09.387,What?
00:23:11.765,00:23:13.391,So here's how it works.
00:23:13.391,00:23:17.313,"Water goes in the top, and food comes out the bottom."
00:23:17.313,00:23:23.610,"So when you shot it into the stratosphere, you figured it would induce a molecular phase change in the vapor from the cumulonimbus layer?"
00:23:23.610,00:23:26.780,That's actually a really smart observation.
00:23:26.780,00:23:29.158,"I mean, heh-heh."
00:23:29.158,00:23:35.373,"The clouds probably have water in them, which, uh, I guess, is why you shot it up there in the first place."
00:23:35.373,00:23:37.708,"Right, right."
00:23:37.708,00:23:39.793,On-- On purpose.
00:23:39.793,00:23:41.628,Right.
00:23:43.214,00:23:44.840,Okay.
00:23:44.840,00:23:48.135,The machine uses a principle of hydro-genetic mutation.
00:23:48.135,00:23:54.892,Water molecules are bombarded with microwave radiation which mutates their genetic recipe into any kind of food you want.
00:23:54.892,00:23:57.435,So...pizza?
00:23:57.435,00:23:58.771,Mashed potatoes?
00:23:58.771,00:24:00.314,Peas?
00:24:00.314,00:24:01.815,Steak? Apples?
00:24:01.815,00:24:03.441,Apple sauce? BLT?
00:24:03.441,00:24:05.736,Pretty sure I said any food.
00:24:05.736,00:24:08.572,"Think about what you're saying, and if it's a food, yes."
00:24:08.572,00:24:11.033,Baloney.
00:24:11.033,00:24:13.535,How about Jell-O?
00:24:13.535,00:24:15.162,I love Jell-O.
00:24:15.162,00:24:17.664,I love Jell-O too.
00:24:17.664,00:24:20.293,"Oh, no, no, no, I am severely allergic to peanuts."
00:24:20.293,00:24:21.501,"Hey, me too."
00:24:21.501,00:24:23.003,What's it called?
00:24:23.003,00:24:25.423,"No, the machine."
00:24:25.423,00:24:30.177,It's called the Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super-Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator.
00:24:30.177,00:24:33.973,"Or, for short: The FLDSMDFR."
00:24:33.973,00:24:35.599,Fliminadifiser?
00:24:35.599,00:24:37.059,FLDSMDFR.
00:24:37.059,00:24:38.602,Fliminubahdibferer?
00:24:38.602,00:24:40.396,Fli.
00:24:40.396,00:24:42.440,Suh.
00:24:42.440,00:24:43.941,Fdiferf.
00:24:43.941,00:24:45.067,Oh.
00:24:45.067,00:24:46.277,"Manny, make sure you get this."
00:24:46.277,00:24:48.070,He's gonna make the food now.
00:24:46.277,00:24:49.363,"Uh, now?"
00:24:49.363,00:24:53.117,"Well, the thing is, I can't..."
00:24:53.117,00:24:56.494,wait to show you this hilarious Internet video.
00:24:57.288,00:24:58.456,SAM: What?
00:25:00.040,00:25:01.959,What is this?
00:25:06.464,00:25:07.923,It's so cute.
00:25:07.923,00:25:09.883,Pushing. Folding. Connecting.
00:25:09.883,00:25:12.886,Taping. Turning.
00:25:12.886,00:25:14.180,Staring.
00:25:14.180,00:25:15.764,Motivating.
00:25:15.764,00:25:17.557,Placing button.
00:25:17.557,00:25:19.643,I can't believe I've been watching this for three hours.
00:25:19.643,00:25:20.686,"I know, heh."
00:25:29.320,00:25:30.612,It's working.
00:25:30.612,00:25:33.157,What do you guys want for breakfast?
00:25:33.157,00:25:35.242,Gummi Bears.
00:25:35.242,00:25:37.786,We both know how you get around Gummi Bears.
00:25:37.786,00:25:40.080,How about eggs.
00:25:40.080,00:25:41.915,And toast.
00:25:41.915,00:25:44.460,And bacon.
00:25:45.294,00:25:46.753,What are you doing?
00:25:46.753,00:25:48.381,Nothing.
00:25:48.381,00:25:49.423,To the computer.
00:25:54.136,00:25:56.222,SAM: So you're sure this is safe?
00:25:56.222,00:25:57.639,Heh-heh-heh.
00:25:57.639,00:26:01.852,I have a Dangeometer that lets us know if the food is going to over-mutate.
00:26:01.852,00:26:03.979,What happens if the food over-mutates?
00:26:03.979,00:26:04.980,I don't know.
00:26:04.980,00:26:06.482,But that'll never happen.
00:26:06.482,00:26:09.068,"All right, this probably won't explode."
00:26:09.068,00:26:10.277,What?
00:26:16.242,00:26:18.285,COMPUTER VOICE: Bacon.
00:26:25.042,00:26:30.214,"Well, those cheeseburgers were only the beginning, because a breakfast system is on its way to Swallow Falls."
00:26:30.214,00:26:31.673,My forecast?
00:26:31.673,00:26:33.675,Sunny side up.
00:26:41.350,00:26:43.436,Yeah.
00:26:51.818,00:26:55.406,"Flint, my boy."
00:26:55.406,00:27:06.959,"All right, here's the skinny: You keep making it rain the snackadoos, weathergirl provides free advertising, I have taken out a very high-interest loan to convert this Podunk town into a tourist food-topia."
00:27:06.959,00:27:19.388,"All you have to do is make it rain food three meals a day every day for the foreseeable future, and in 30 days we hold a grand reopening of the island as a must-see cruise destination."
00:27:19.388,00:27:26.395,"And everyone, everywhere, is going to love your invention."
00:27:26.395,00:27:28.355,Do you think so?
00:27:28.355,00:27:31.191,I know so.
00:27:35.112,00:27:38.115,Now that's what I call poultry in motion.
00:27:48.000,00:27:50.710,"Mr. Lockwood, may I please have waffles?"
00:27:50.710,00:27:52.296,Falafels?
00:27:52.296,00:27:54.590,Avocado.
00:27:56.550,00:27:58.093,Leftovers?
00:27:58.093,00:28:06.310,"Not a problem with Flint Lockwood's latest invention, the Outtasighter, so-named because it catapults uneaten food out of sight and therefore, out of mind."
00:28:15.611,00:28:17.613,KIDS: Jellybeans!
00:28:17.613,00:28:18.780,Awesome.

00:28:35.839,00:28:38.967,"Oh, uh, you look different."
00:28:38.967,00:28:40.844,"Uh, did you get a new haircut?"
00:28:40.844,00:28:42.971,"Yes, I did."
00:28:51.730,00:28:53.566,"I love you, kid."
00:28:53.566,00:28:55.651,"BOY: I love spending time with you, Dad."

00:29:02.533,00:29:05.118,"If you wanna come, I could show you how I make the food."
00:29:05.118,00:29:08.121,"Eh, no, thanks."
00:29:08.121,00:29:13.877,"Tha-- That techno-food, it-- It's too complicated for an old fisherman."
00:29:13.877,00:29:16.589,Got it.
00:29:16.589,00:29:20.175,"Could still use your help around here, though, you know."
00:29:20.175,00:29:23.011,"I'm working with the mayor now, Dad."
00:29:23.011,00:29:26.432,"I mean, the town's grand reopening is in, like, a week."
00:29:26.432,00:29:28.350,Right. Got it.
00:29:35.399,00:29:37.901,Flint Lockwood?
00:29:37.901,00:29:40.112,Yeah?
00:29:40.112,00:29:47.411,"Huh, it's my son Cal's birthday tomorrow and I was just wondering if you could make it rain something special."
00:29:47.411,00:29:50.080,"Well, I'm pretty backed up on requests."
00:29:50.080,00:29:51.915,"Plus, you're always mean to me."
00:29:51.915,00:29:56.503,It'll be just one time for my special angel's special day.
00:29:56.503,00:29:59.089,"Ah, I don't know."
00:29:59.089,00:30:02.635,"You know, I don't wanna overwork the machine, so..."
00:30:02.635,00:30:06.221,Okay. I knew it was a long shot.
00:30:06.221,00:30:09.224,I just wanted Cal to see how much his father loves him.
00:30:09.224,00:30:11.143,I thought you would understand.
00:30:13.853,00:30:20.360,You know how fathers always trying to express their love and appreciation for their sons.
00:30:23.781,00:30:25.073,"Earl, wait."

00:31:00.359,00:31:02.027,"Happy birthday, son."

00:31:33.767,00:31:34.976,"Come on, Dad."
00:31:34.976,00:31:36.687,"I don't know, Cal."
00:31:36.687,00:31:38.605,This doesn't look safe!
00:31:46.905,00:31:48.114,"I love you, son."
00:31:48.114,00:31:51.577,"I know, Dad."
00:31:55.455,00:31:57.332,"Flint, this is amazing."
00:31:57.332,00:32:02.128,"And designing the ice cream to accumulate into scoops, I don't know how you're gonna top this."
00:32:02.128,00:32:04.381,Maybe with hot fudge.
00:32:06.216,00:32:08.468,"CAL: Hey, Flint."
00:32:08.468,00:32:10.804,You wanna be in a snowball fight with us?
00:32:12.180,00:32:13.849,"Flint, what's the problem?"
00:32:13.849,00:32:15.893,I-I've never actually been in a snowball fight.
00:32:15.893,00:32:16.976,Really?
00:32:16.976,00:32:18.937,I-I don't even know the rules.
00:32:18.937,00:32:24.401,"Is there like a point system, or is it to the death?"
00:32:22.524,00:32:25.861,No-- You've nev--?
00:32:24.401,00:32:28.280,"I mean, look, even Steve is throwing chocolate snowballs."
00:32:31.575,00:32:32.534,Oh.
00:32:32.534,00:32:34.244,Mmm.
00:32:34.244,00:32:37.080,So like this?
00:32:37.080,00:32:38.206,Egh.
00:32:38.206,00:32:40.626,"No, harder than that."
00:32:41.251,00:32:42.753,Oh.
00:32:42.753,00:32:45.631,Snowball.
00:32:46.423,00:32:49.092,Snowball. Snowball.
00:32:49.092,00:32:52.304,"Well, something to be said for enthusiasm."
00:32:52.304,00:32:54.431,Snowball!
00:32:54.431,00:32:56.141,Snowball!
00:32:59.561,00:33:01.480,Snowball and snowball.
00:33:01.480,00:33:02.940,WOMAN: Kids? What's going on?
00:33:02.940,00:33:04.983,Snowball.
00:33:06.192,00:33:07.986,Snowball.
00:33:07.986,00:33:18.872,"SAM: I scream, you scream, we all scream for Flint Lockwood's latest tasty town-wide treat, with flurries of frozen fun on what the mayor declared to be an ice cream snow day."
00:33:18.872,00:33:30.467,"He'd also like to invite everyone in the world to catch a cruise liner, and come on down this Saturday for the grand opening of Chew And Swallow, a town that is truly √† la mode."
00:33:37.891,00:33:41.227,A town that is truly topped with ice cream.
00:33:41.227,00:33:46.859,"With today's scoop for the Weather News Network, I'm Sam Sparks."
00:33:46.859,00:33:49.987,"BOY: Flint, this is the best breakfast ever!"
00:33:57.243,00:33:58.453,That's it!
00:33:58.453,00:34:00.330,Researching. Role-playing.
00:34:00.330,00:34:01.915,Dialing.
00:34:01.915,00:34:03.333,Waiting.
00:34:05.711,00:34:07.838,Sam Sparks.
00:34:07.838,00:34:08.881,Regretting.
00:34:08.881,00:34:10.298,Re-psyching.
00:34:10.298,00:34:11.884,Saying what I'm doing.
00:34:11.884,00:34:13.426,Flint?
00:34:13.426,00:34:15.012,"Hi, Sam, how are you?"
00:34:15.012,00:34:18.473,I was wondering if you would like to go on a da-- Activity with me tomorrow.
00:34:19.307,00:34:20.809,"Um, okay."
00:34:20.809,00:34:22.978,"Great, bye."
00:34:22.978,00:34:25.564,"Nailed it. Gotta go, Steve."
00:34:25.564,00:34:28.817,Keep an eye on the lab for me.
00:34:30.109,00:34:32.821,Steve.
00:34:32.821,00:34:34.823,Foster still at the plate.
00:34:34.823,00:34:36.909,And nobody out.
00:34:36.909,00:34:38.493,Where are we going?
00:34:38.493,00:34:40.954,"Oh, nowhere."
00:34:38.493,00:34:44.165,I just thought it'd be nice for the two of us to go on a walk together.
00:34:45.208,00:34:48.670,Like you do as friends.
00:34:48.670,00:34:51.590,"Oh, my, what's that?"
00:34:51.590,00:34:52.465,Wow.
00:34:59.389,00:35:02.642,"Oh, Jell-O's my favorite."
00:35:02.642,00:35:07.647,"You never made a request, so I made one for you."
00:35:10.275,00:35:12.318,Flint?
00:35:12.318,00:35:13.862,Flint?
00:35:13.862,00:35:15.864,Join me.
00:35:17.490,00:35:18.575,Whoa.
00:35:29.377,00:35:30.754,But how did you--?
00:35:30.754,00:35:38.929,"Oh, I just made it rain Jell-O, then I gathered it up with the Outtasighter, and then I brought it here and pressed it into a gigantic custom-carved plastic Tupperware mold I made."
00:35:38.929,00:35:40.138,No big deal.
00:35:41.848,00:35:44.309,Everything's made of Jell-O.
00:35:44.309,00:35:54.527,"This piano, those sconces, that ghetto blaster, that Jell-O, that aquarium, that Venus de Milo with your face on it next to a Michelangelo's David that also has your face."
00:35:54.527,00:35:58.364,"Come on, Sam, what are you waiting for?"
00:36:00.033,00:36:01.534,Nothing!
00:36:02.911,00:36:04.037,Whoo.
00:36:04.037,00:36:05.288,Yeah!
00:36:08.834,00:36:09.876,Whoo.
00:36:09.876,00:36:11.210,Whoo.
00:36:18.093,00:36:20.012,Cannonball.
00:36:21.220,00:36:22.889,Belly flop.
00:36:25.976,00:36:28.353,Why did I do that?
00:36:36.361,00:36:38.488,So Jell-O.
00:36:38.488,00:36:45.328,"It's a solid, it's a liquid, it's a visco-elastic polymer made of polypeptide chains, but you eat it."
00:36:45.328,00:36:49.290,"I mean, it tastes good."
00:36:49.290,00:36:51.417,Why do you do that?
00:36:51.417,00:36:55.296,Say something super smart and then bail from it.
00:36:57.340,00:36:58.591,Can you keep a secret?
00:36:58.591,00:37:01.302,No.
00:37:01.302,00:37:03.930,"But-- But this time, sure, yeah."
00:37:03.930,00:37:11.354,"Okay. Well, it was a really long time ago, but I, too, was..."
00:37:12.564,00:37:13.982,a nerd.
00:37:13.982,00:37:15.650,Too?
00:37:15.650,00:37:24.492,"When I was a little girl, I wore a ponytail, I had glasses, and I was totally obsessed with the science of weather."
00:37:26.953,00:37:28.997,Other girls wanted a Barbie.
00:37:28.997,00:37:33.043,I wanted a Doppler Weather Radar 2000 Turbo.
00:37:33.043,00:37:37.338,But all the kids used to taunt me with this lame song.
00:37:37.338,00:37:47.015,ALL: Go on.
00:37:47.015,00:37:53.479,"So I got a new look, gave up the science-y smart stuff, and I was never made fun of again."
00:37:53.479,00:37:57.650,"And I still need these glasses, but I never wear them."
00:37:57.650,00:37:59.527,I'll bet you look great with glasses on.
00:37:59.527,00:38:02.030,I'm really-- And on they go.
00:38:04.908,00:38:06.325,Whoa.
00:38:06.325,00:38:07.702,Nothing.
00:38:12.582,00:38:15.043,It's a Jell-O scrunchie.
00:38:17.879,00:38:20.924,"And now, the reveal."
00:38:24.219,00:38:25.470,Wow.
00:38:26.471,00:38:33.937,"I mean, you were okay before, but now, you're beautiful."
00:38:33.937,00:38:36.898,"No, I'm not. I can't go out in public like this."
00:38:36.898,00:38:39.859,"Well, why not?"
00:38:39.859,00:38:43.155,"I mean, this is the real you, right?"
00:38:44.405,00:38:46.158,Smart.
00:38:46.158,00:38:48.743,Bespectacled.
00:38:48.743,00:38:50.870,Who wouldn't wanna see that?
00:38:50.870,00:38:55.458,"You know, I've never met anyone like you, Flint Lockwood."
00:38:55.458,00:38:57.585,Me either.
00:38:57.585,00:38:59.921,But about you.
00:39:16.562,00:39:22.568,PHONE RINGTONE: Is your phone ringing?
00:39:22.568,00:39:25.697,That's weird.
00:39:25.697,00:39:28.116,"Oh, it's the mayor."
00:39:28.116,00:39:29.242,"No, no, no."
00:39:29.242,00:39:30.576,"Go ahead, take it."
00:39:30.576,00:39:32.204,I'm sorry.
00:39:32.204,00:39:34.289,I should be going too.
00:39:34.289,00:39:35.623,I'm just gonna step outside.
00:39:35.623,00:39:37.292,Aye!
00:39:45.967,00:39:48.136,"Dad, you came."
00:39:48.136,00:39:49.304,Do I look all right?
00:39:49.304,00:39:51.348,You look great.
00:39:51.348,00:39:54.142,"FLINT: Dad, it was so cool."
00:39:54.142,00:39:56.477,"It's Baby Brent, you know?"
00:39:56.477,00:39:58.771,Uh-oh.
00:39:58.771,00:40:00.690,"Hey, Brian."
00:40:00.690,00:40:03.484,What?
00:40:03.484,00:40:06.029,That guy's a nerd.
00:40:07.947,00:40:10.367,"Hey, how's it going?"
00:40:10.367,00:40:12.994,"Oh, thank you."
00:40:12.994,00:40:14.204,A toast.
00:40:14.204,00:40:16.497,To Flint and his delicious steaks.
00:40:16.497,00:40:18.624,"Oh, thanks."
00:40:18.624,00:40:19.542,Very nice place.
00:40:19.542,00:40:21.711,"Oh, wow."
00:40:21.711,00:40:22.837,Flint Lockwood.
00:40:22.837,00:40:24.047,Earl.
00:40:30.053,00:40:31.512,So no roof.
00:40:31.512,00:40:33.973,Yep. You just hold out your plate.
00:40:33.973,00:40:37.352,And I even made it rain your favorite: Meat.
00:40:37.352,00:40:39.020,Mmm.
00:40:44.525,00:40:46.986,Okay.
00:40:44.525,00:40:49.948,So you know how the grand reopening of the town is tomorrow?
00:40:49.948,00:40:55.287,"Well, the mayor has asked me to cut the ribbon."
00:40:55.287,00:40:57.914,He said my invention saved the town.
00:40:57.914,00:41:00.666,Aren't you proud of me?
00:41:02.043,00:41:13.346,"Uh-- Well, mm, doesn't this steak look a little big to you?"
00:41:15.265,00:41:17.100,"Yeah, it's a big steak."
00:41:17.100,00:41:20.645,"I mean, every steak is not exactly the same size."
00:41:20.645,00:41:23.356,Did you even hear what I just said?
00:41:24.607,00:41:26.443,"Son, look around."
00:41:26.443,00:41:29.112,I'm not sure this is good for-- For people.
00:41:31.030,00:41:33.158,Maybe you should think about turning it off.
00:41:33.158,00:41:36.244,It's making everybody happy.
00:41:36.244,00:41:38.204,Everybody except you.
00:41:38.204,00:41:45.462,When are you gonna accept that this is who I am instead of trying to get me to work in some boring tackle shop?
00:41:46.463,00:41:51.717,"Well, you seem like you know what you're doing, then."
00:41:53.428,00:41:56.264,I guess I'll just get out of your way.
00:42:24.167,00:42:25.502,"Get with the times, man."
00:42:25.502,00:42:28.296,"I mean, there's no pleasing that guy."
00:42:28.296,00:42:31.924,He just wants to take anything good I do and just smoosh it.
00:42:42.227,00:42:44.854,These are big hot dogs.
00:42:55.031,00:42:57.158,"Oh, man."
00:42:57.158,00:42:59.702,"I mean, this isn't that bad."
00:42:59.702,00:43:01.746,"Is it, Steve?"
00:43:01.746,00:43:03.456,"You're right, Steve."
00:43:03.456,00:43:06.000,The Dangeometer is in the yellow.
00:43:06.000,00:43:07.544,I don't know what to do.
00:43:07.544,00:43:09.295,MAYOR: I do.
00:43:09.295,00:43:12.715,Declare these hot dogs to be delicious!
00:43:12.715,00:43:14.384,"Agh! Oh, no."
00:43:14.384,00:43:15.843,Whoa!
00:43:15.843,00:43:17.678,How did you get in here?
00:43:17.678,00:43:19.638,"Tomorrow's the big day, Flint."
00:43:19.638,00:43:23.601,The entire town's fate is resting on your food weather.
00:43:23.601,00:43:24.894,I'm thinking pasta.
00:43:24.894,00:43:26.438,Some light apps.
00:43:26.438,00:43:29.857,I know you won't let us down.
00:43:31.692,00:43:34.862,"Mr. Mayor, I-- I think there's something you should see."
00:43:34.862,00:43:36.239,What?
00:43:36.239,00:43:40.785,This is the molecular structure of a hot dog that fell last week.
00:43:40.785,00:43:45.831,And this is the molecular structure of a hot dog that fell today.
00:43:45.831,00:43:49.710,The machine uses microwave radiation to mutate the genetic recipe of the food.
00:43:49.710,00:43:57.093,"The more we ask it to make, the more clouds it takes in, the more radiation it emits, the more these food molecules could over-mutate."
00:43:57.093,00:44:00.513,I think that's why the food is getting bigger.
00:44:00.513,00:44:05.810,"Here's what I heard: blah, blah, blah, science, science, science, bigger."
00:44:05.810,00:44:07.604,And bigger is better.
00:44:07.604,00:44:11.983,Everyone's gonna love these new portion sizes.
00:44:11.983,00:44:13.859,I know I do.
00:44:16.446,00:44:18.531,My dad thinks I should turn it off.
00:44:18.531,00:44:22.743,"Geniuses like us are never understood by their fathers, Flint."
00:44:22.743,00:44:29.542,But what if things go-- Who needs the approval of one family member when you can have it from millions of acquaintances?
00:44:29.542,00:44:33.296,"Not to mention that little cutlet, Sam Sparks."
00:44:33.296,00:44:35.006,And me.
00:44:35.006,00:44:39.260,"I've always felt that you were like a son to me, Flint."
00:44:39.260,00:44:50.896,"And I'm gonna be so proud of you tomorrow when you cut that ribbon, save the town, and prove to everybody what a great inventor you are."
00:44:50.896,00:45:01.324,"So here's the cheese: You can keep it going, get everything you've ever wanted, and be the great man I know you can be."
00:45:01.324,00:45:10.041,"Or you can turn it off, ruin everything, and no one will ever like you."
00:45:10.041,00:45:12.460,It's your choice.
00:45:12.460,00:45:14.003,Choice.
00:45:14.003,00:45:16.797,Choice. Choice.
00:45:16.797,00:45:18.257,Choice.
00:45:18.257,00:45:20.134,Choice.
00:45:22.887,00:45:24.138,Okay.
00:45:35.149,00:45:39.153,"I mean, bigger is better, right?"
00:45:39.153,00:45:40.821,"Oh, yeah."
00:45:44.992,00:45:48.996,COMPUTER VOICE: Spaghetti. Asparagus. Celery.
00:46:01.426,00:46:02.510,MAN 1: Looks safe to me.
00:46:02.510,00:46:04.970,MAN 2: And sanitary too.
00:46:15.648,00:46:17.149,Whoa.
00:46:32.290,00:46:34.250,Uh...
00:46:38.337,00:46:41.674,MAYOR: Who's hungry?
00:46:41.674,00:46:46.512,"Welcome, tourists, to Chew And Swallow."
00:46:46.512,00:46:48.180,That is one big mayor.
00:46:48.180,00:46:52.809,Delight in our nacho-cheese hot springs.
00:46:52.809,00:46:59.024,Allow your kids to eat all the junk food they want in our completely unsupervised Kid Zone!
00:46:59.024,00:47:01.193,I've got jellybeans for teeth.
00:47:01.193,00:47:07.325,"And when the fun is done, gaze upon the sunset cresting over Mount Leftovers."
00:47:07.325,00:47:11.287,From which we're protected by a presumably indestructible dam.
00:47:11.287,00:47:16.875,"We've got people here today from all around the world, from as far as China to West Virginia."
00:47:16.875,00:47:19.545,Also I think there's some Canadians here.
00:47:19.545,00:47:21.589,You need to look at this.
00:47:21.589,00:47:23.966,You're supposed to be broadcasting this.
00:47:23.966,00:47:26.594,There's a problem. I think the food's getting bigger.
00:47:26.594,00:47:28.053,"I know, it's great."
00:47:28.053,00:47:30.014,Bigger portion sizes.
00:47:30.014,00:47:32.475,I'm not sure we're doing the right thing here.
00:47:30.014,00:47:34.893,Sam-- What if we've bitten off more than we can chew?
00:47:34.893,00:47:39.273,"For the first time in my life, everybody loves something that I've done."
00:47:39.273,00:47:44.278,Why can't you just be happy for me and go say the weather or something? Jeez.
00:47:44.278,00:47:52.453,"MAYOR: And without further ado, our town's hero and my metaphorical son, Flint Lockwood."
00:47:52.453,00:47:54.079,"MAN: Yeah, Flint."
00:47:54.079,00:47:56.207,"Thank you. Thank you, everyone."
00:47:56.207,00:47:58.083,Sign my shrimp.
00:47:58.083,00:48:00.085,Yeah! Yeah!
00:48:00.085,00:48:02.839,"MAN: I admire your quirkiness, dude."
00:48:02.839,00:48:06.592,"Brent, we're gonna need you to hand over the ceremonial scissors."
00:48:06.592,00:48:09.928,But-- No.
00:48:09.928,00:48:11.430,BRENT: You can't.
00:48:11.430,00:48:13.224,BRENT: You can't take them. No.
00:48:13.224,00:48:16.310,I'm Baby Brent.
00:48:16.769,00:48:18.145,Uh-oh.
00:48:18.145,00:48:19.313,Put your clothes back on.
00:48:21.607,00:48:24.151,Who am I?
00:48:25.778,00:48:28.072,"Go ahead, Flint."
00:48:28.072,00:48:30.491,Everybody loves you.
00:48:30.491,00:48:33.536,CROWD: Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!
00:48:33.536,00:48:36.455,Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!
00:49:09.488,00:49:11.532,Danger. Danger. Danger.
00:49:11.532,00:49:12.617,Danger. Danger. Danger.
00:49:12.617,00:49:13.992,Danger. Danger. Danger.
00:49:16.245,00:49:19.164,Salt-and-pepper wind?
00:49:20.750,00:49:22.334,Oregano.
00:49:34.305,00:49:36.515,Mamma mia.
00:49:38.810,00:49:42.396,"Sam, wait."
00:49:46.943,00:49:49.069,I can turn it off.
00:50:01.958,00:50:04.710,"All right, kid, it's all gonna be okay."
00:50:07.254,00:50:09.423,"Oh, no."
00:50:11.467,00:50:13.511,Pardon me.
00:50:14.846,00:50:16.681,Excuse me.
00:50:21.101,00:50:22.436,No!
00:50:30.194,00:50:31.278,Gummi Bears.
00:50:31.278,00:50:32.738,"Not now, Steve."
00:50:38.703,00:50:41.706,MAN: Condiments? Salt? Pepper?
00:50:41.706,00:50:42.957,ALL: Eww!
00:50:44.375,00:50:46.293,Flint.
00:50:49.755,00:50:58.556,"This is Sam Sparks, live from Chew And Swallow, where a spaghetti twister-- Whoa, Sam, hey, we love a good storm over here, but you look like a nerd."
00:50:58.556,00:51:03.185,"Patrick, several children are stranded in the path of this tomato tornado."
00:51:03.185,00:51:04.896,My tummy hurts.
00:51:06.564,00:51:07.899,Cal!
00:51:07.899,00:51:10.609,Yikes!
00:51:10.609,00:51:12.236,I haven't seen one of those since 1995.
00:51:12.236,00:51:16.072,What? We have an actual weather emergency.
00:51:16.072,00:51:20.327,"Well, we'll get right back to that storm, and hopefully Sam'll look a little more appealing."
00:51:28.669,00:51:33.841,"Steve, we just have to upload the kill code and then we'll shut down the-- Oh! What are you doing here?"
00:51:33.841,00:51:36.385,I've been up here ordering dinner for the last 10 minutes.
00:51:36.385,00:51:37.595,Why? Is something going on?
00:51:37.595,00:51:38.888,I've gotta stop the machine.
00:51:38.888,00:51:41.306,Everyone's in danger because of me.
00:51:41.306,00:51:44.560,"Oh, it can't be that bad."
00:51:44.560,00:51:47.271,"I don't-- No. A-- Well, I'm out of here."
00:51:47.271,00:51:50.024,I can still stop the order with the kill code.
00:51:52.818,00:51:54.110,Sending kill code.
00:51:54.110,00:51:55.613,I'm back.
00:51:55.613,00:51:57.990,FLINT: Got to get the button.
00:51:57.990,00:51:59.324,Agh!
00:51:59.324,00:52:00.743,Play. Fun. Fun. Play.
00:52:00.743,00:52:04.622,"Hey, Flint. It's been nice to beet you."
00:52:06.082,00:52:08.793,That's a radish!
00:52:30.188,00:52:35.027,That was the only way to communicate with the machine.
00:52:35.027,00:52:36.862,What exactly did you order?
00:52:36.862,00:52:42.534,A Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet.
00:52:42.534,00:52:46.455,COMPUTER VOICE: Jellybean. Watermelon.
00:52:46.455,00:52:50.084,Cheeseburger. Egg salad.
00:52:50.084,00:52:52.920,Ma-a-a-arshmallow.
00:52:54.088,00:52:56.007,Strawberry.
00:53:00.719,00:53:03.514,MAN: Is everyone okay?
00:53:09.895,00:53:12.481,"EARL: Help, somebody."
00:53:12.481,00:53:14.608,"Help me, please."
00:53:14.608,00:53:16.485,It's my son.
00:53:16.485,00:53:18.487,We need a doctor.
00:53:18.487,00:53:21.532,Is anyone here a doctor?
00:53:21.532,00:53:23.575,I am a doctor.
00:53:23.575,00:53:24.743,You are?
00:53:24.743,00:53:27.579,"I was, back in Guatemala."
00:53:27.579,00:53:29.665,I came here for a better life.
00:53:29.665,00:53:31.125,"Pretty great decision, eh?"
00:53:36.088,00:53:37.631,"How is he, doc?"
00:53:39.508,00:53:40.968,He's in a food coma.
00:53:42.803,00:53:44.055,Too much junk food.
00:53:44.055,00:53:45.556,"I need a celery, stat."
00:53:45.556,00:53:47.265,Here you go.
00:53:50.644,00:53:51.687,Daddy?
00:53:51.687,00:53:54.148,"Oh, Cal. Cal."
00:53:54.148,00:53:56.650,"I love you, son."
00:54:00.154,00:54:02.156,Looks like everything turned out okay.
00:54:02.156,00:54:03.699,"SAM: Not yet, it hasn't."
00:54:03.699,00:54:07.161,That spaghetti twister was an amuse-bouche compared to what's on the way.
00:54:07.161,00:54:09.205,What's an amuse-bouche?
00:54:09.205,00:54:10.873,"Manny, patch us through."
00:54:16.087,00:54:17.337,Go.
00:54:17.337,00:54:20.465,"Cute report, Nancy."
00:54:20.465,00:54:21.633,"Can it, Patrick."
00:54:21.633,00:54:25.137,We are about to be in the epicenter of a perfect food storm.
00:54:25.137,00:54:27.431,It's going to spread across the globe.
00:54:27.431,00:54:31.351,I've calculated the Coriolis acceleration of the storm system.
00:54:31.351,00:54:38.859,"First, it'll hit New York, then Paris, then the Jiayuguan Pass in eastern China."
00:54:38.859,00:54:43.864,And in four hours the entire northern hemisphere will be one big potluck.
00:55:09.974,00:55:11.391,Flint?
00:55:19.608,00:55:20.609,Flint?
00:55:20.609,00:55:22.360,"Hey, Dad."
00:55:22.360,00:55:24.696,What are you doing?
00:55:24.696,00:55:32.037,"Well, I tried to help everybody, but instead I ruined everything."
00:55:32.037,00:55:34.248,I'm just a piece of junk.
00:55:34.248,00:55:38.294,So I threw myself away.
00:55:38.294,00:55:42.214,Along with all these dumb inventions.
00:55:42.214,00:55:43.423,This is junk.
00:55:44.758,00:55:47.094,This is junk.
00:55:49.263,00:55:51.015,This is junk.
00:55:51.015,00:55:54.143,"Oh, son."
00:55:51.015,00:56:00.774,"L-Listen, when your boat is, when it's listing, and if it's not running, you know-- Don't worry, Dad, I get it."
00:56:00.774,00:56:02.609,Mom was wrong about me.
00:56:03.902,00:56:07.363,I'm not an inventor.
00:56:07.363,00:56:09.950,I should've just quit when you said.
00:56:17.457,00:56:23.714,"Well, when it rains, you put on a coat."
00:56:23.714,00:56:31.972,"Dad, you know I don't understand fishing metapho-- What?"
00:56:35.893,00:56:37.144,My coat.
00:56:47.238,00:56:52.076,"Come on, Steve."
00:56:58.498,00:56:59.958,Kill code downloading.
00:57:02.253,00:57:04.796,Redesigning. Virtualizing.
00:57:04.796,00:57:07.049,Cutting.
00:57:07.049,00:57:09.760,Welding. Forging.
00:57:09.760,00:57:10.677,Wiring.
00:57:10.677,00:57:11.845,Helping.
00:57:11.845,00:57:13.680,Testing.
00:57:14.639,00:57:16.767,Yes!
00:57:20.020,00:57:22.439,Flying Car 2.
00:57:22.439,00:57:25.317,Now with wings.
00:57:35.202,00:57:38.789,"Hey, I had a weird dream like this once."
00:57:38.789,00:57:41.917,I have a macaroni on my head.
00:57:49.800,00:57:51.260,ALL: No school!
00:57:55.889,00:58:00.477,"Still nothing, nothing in the bottom of the third inning."
00:58:08.235,00:58:09.611,Everyone.
00:58:11.447,00:58:13.698,I want to apologize.
00:58:14.992,00:58:17.619,"Especially to you, Sam."
00:58:17.619,00:58:19.413,But I have a plan.
00:58:19.413,00:58:22.040,This flash drive contains a kill code.
00:58:22.040,00:58:32.176,"I will fly up into that food storm, plug it into the machine, and shut it down forever, while you guys evacuate the island, using brea-- This is all his fault. Get him."
00:58:32.176,00:58:33.302,There he is! Get him!
00:58:33.302,00:58:34.719,MAN: Get Flint!
00:58:34.719,00:58:38.265,Let's rock his car back and forth.
00:58:42.560,00:58:44.688,Hey!
00:58:44.688,00:58:48.150,This mess we're in is all our faults.
00:58:49.401,00:58:52.363,"Me, I didn't even protect my own son."
00:58:52.363,00:58:55.032,"Look, I'm as mad at Flint as you are."
00:58:55.032,00:58:59.536,"In fact, when he gets out of that car, I'm gonna slap him in the face."
00:58:59.536,00:59:03.832,"I know Flint Lockwood made the food, but it was made-to-order."
00:59:03.832,00:59:06.960,And now it's time for all of us to pay the bill.
00:59:17.388,00:59:19.181,"Thank you, Earl."
00:59:19.181,00:59:20.349,Ow.
00:59:20.349,00:59:22.226,Sorry.
00:59:22.226,00:59:23.977,Let's go build some boats.
00:59:23.977,00:59:25.729,Yeah.
00:59:26.813,00:59:28.773,I'm gonna go build a boat.
00:59:30.150,00:59:31.985,I'm coming with you.
00:59:31.985,00:59:34.821,You're gonna need someone to navigate you through that storm.
00:59:36.448,00:59:38.075,I can't let you do this alone.
00:59:38.075,00:59:39.784,"Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry."
00:59:39.784,00:59:41.953,Are you kidding?
00:59:39.784,00:59:43.580,"Well, I just thought that we-- No."
00:59:43.580,00:59:45.623,MANNY: You are going to need a copilot.
00:59:45.623,00:59:47.042,You're a pilot too?
00:59:47.042,00:59:49.920,Yes. I am also a particle physicist.
00:59:49.920,00:59:52.172,Really?
00:59:52.172,00:59:53.382,I am also a comedian.
00:59:55.717,00:59:57.177,Let's do this thing.
00:59:57.177,00:59:58.762,BRENT: I'm coming too.
00:59:58.762,01:00:01.432,"Brent, uh, that's okay."
01:00:01.432,01:00:04.226,"No, it's not okay."
01:00:04.226,01:00:08.146,I've been coasting on my fame since I was a baby.
01:00:08.146,01:00:11.108,But it was all just an illusion.
01:00:11.108,01:00:15.404,Maybe up there I'll find out who I really am.
01:00:15.404,01:00:18.865,"Ah, the car's pretty full, so..."
01:00:19.783,01:00:21.368,Yeah!
01:00:21.368,01:00:22.702,Brent!
01:00:22.702,01:00:24.621,Okay.
01:00:36.967,01:00:39.010,"Good luck, son."
01:00:46.560,01:00:48.853,Steve.
01:00:49.938,01:00:51.273,SAM: Pea-soup fog.
01:00:51.273,01:00:52.732,"FLINT: Manny, hit the wipers."
01:00:56.445,01:01:01.783,"Flint, There's massive gastro-precipitation accumulated around the machine."
01:01:01.783,01:01:07.289,It's almost as if it's-- Inside a giant meatball.
01:01:11.376,01:01:17.633,"Water goes in the top, a food hurricane comes out the bottom."
01:01:17.633,01:01:19.884,BRENT: Glad I'm wearing a diaper.
01:01:36.610,01:01:38.236,Anybody order pizza?
01:01:38.236,01:01:39.154,Whoa!
01:01:39.154,01:01:41.448,FLINT: Hold on.
01:01:41.448,01:01:43.408,The pizza's chasing us?
01:01:43.408,01:01:45.577,Sentient food?
01:01:45.577,01:01:48.539,Unless its molecular structure's mutated into super food!
01:01:48.539,01:01:52.167,BOTH: That's been genetically engineered to protect the FLDSMDFR.
01:01:52.167,01:01:53.960,STEVE: Pizza.
01:01:53.960,01:01:56.547,Pizza. Pizza. Pizza.
01:01:59.466,01:02:01.009,That was close.
