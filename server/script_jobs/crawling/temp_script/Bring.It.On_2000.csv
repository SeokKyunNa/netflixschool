00:02:29.357,00:02:31.401,"-Yeah! -Go, Toros!"
00:02:31.484,00:02:34.946,"Yeah, come on! Yeah! All right!"
00:02:39.117,00:02:41.119,"Oh, my God!"
00:02:41.786,00:02:43.288,-Nice rack! -Huh?
00:02:43.371,00:02:44.956,"Oh, baby!"
00:02:45.874,00:02:47.458,Serves her right!
00:02:47.542,00:02:49.836,Check out the hooters!
00:03:02.098,00:03:03.516,Holy shit.
00:03:18.031,00:03:20.199,"Hey, hey, Mr. and Mrs. S."
00:03:20.283,00:03:21.326,"Oh, look, it's Aaron."
00:03:21.409,00:03:23.411,"Oh! Hello, Aaron."
00:03:23.494,00:03:24.621,"Hey, can I help?"
00:03:24.704,00:03:27.248,"Oh, no. We're fine, thanks. Really. Stay in your vehicle."
00:03:27.332,00:03:29.626,You sure?
00:03:30.710,00:03:32.170,Bye! Be back later!
00:03:32.253,00:03:33.212,"-Bye. -Bye, honey."
00:03:33.296,00:03:34.881,Hi.
00:03:38.676,00:03:40.053,"Come on, Tor."
00:03:40.136,00:03:42.347,Can't mack on you in front of the parentals.
00:03:42.430,00:03:44.224,Bye-bye!
00:03:51.481,00:03:53.983,"Remember, he's leaving for college."
00:03:54.067,00:03:55.276,Right.
00:03:57.570,00:03:58.488,"So, are you excited?"
00:03:58.571,00:03:59.906,"Oh, yeah!"
00:03:59.989,00:04:03.660,"It's college, Tor. I'm really stoked, you know?"
00:04:03.743,00:04:07.622,"It's just, you know, I'm gonna miss you."
00:04:07.705,00:04:09.290,-Really? -Yeah.
00:04:09.374,00:04:15.338,"But next year, it'll be you and me reunited at Cal State Dominguez Hills."
00:04:15.421,00:04:19.842,"I'll be the experienced sophomore, you'll be the hot, new freshman."
00:04:19.926,00:04:23.763,"Yup. It'll be just like high school, only better."
00:04:24.305,00:04:25.515,Dorm rooms.
00:04:25.598,00:04:27.141,Hmm.
00:04:40.280,00:04:41.489,"I got the door, Tor."
00:04:41.572,00:04:42.573,Okay.
00:04:42.657,00:04:44.158,"I got the door, Tor."
00:04:44.242,00:04:45.326,All right.
00:04:45.410,00:04:47.620,"-What's up, Aaron? -Hey, what up, Grady?"
00:04:48.413,00:04:49.831,-Hey! -Yeah!
00:04:49.914,00:04:53.626,"Hey, hey, remember, when you get captain, act surprised, okay?"
00:04:53.710,00:04:55.086,Don't jinx me.
00:04:55.169,00:04:56.087,"Hi, Torrance."
00:04:56.170,00:04:57.338,"Hey, Aaron."
00:04:57.422,00:04:59.007,"Ah, ladies."
00:04:59.090,00:05:00.174,Good luck at school.
00:05:00.258,00:05:01.175,Thank you.
00:05:01.259,00:05:03.720,"Oh, Aaron, come to one last practice?"
00:05:03.803,00:05:06.014,You know you're still my favorite cheerleader.
00:05:06.097,00:05:07.140,-Aw! -Please?
00:05:07.223,00:05:09.183,"I'm sorry, guys. I gotta run."
00:05:09.267,00:05:10.310,You're not staying for the vote?
00:05:10.393,00:05:11.894,"Hey, I really gotta beat traffic."
00:05:11.978,00:05:13.479,I can't be late for orientation.
00:05:13.563,00:05:15.982,-But I really want… -Hey. Hey.
00:05:16.983,00:05:19.360,Mmm. Trust me. You're gonna get it.
00:05:21.112,00:05:22.655,-Bye-bye. -Bye.
00:05:28.911,00:05:30.204,"-Did you vote? -Oh, yeah."
00:05:30.288,00:05:32.915,Darcy thinks she should get captain 'cause her dad pays for everything.
00:05:32.999,00:05:34.709,He should use some of that money to buy her a clue.
00:05:34.792,00:05:35.877,Oh!
00:05:37.295,00:05:38.504,Courtney'll get captain.
00:05:38.588,00:05:40.381,The guys love clutching her butt.
00:05:40.465,00:05:42.133,"Yeah, she's got a lot to hang on to."
00:05:42.216,00:05:43.634,What's plural for butt?
00:05:43.718,00:05:45.094,"On one person, I mean."
00:05:45.178,00:05:47.555,She puts the ass in massive.
00:05:47.638,00:05:49.599,You put the lude in deluded.
00:05:49.682,00:05:52.310,Yo! Can I have all your votes?
00:05:52.393,00:05:54.228,-Mine. -Here's me.
00:05:58.149,00:05:59.692,Thank you.
00:06:00.651,00:06:03.237,"We should get Big Red a gift, or at least someone should say something."
00:06:03.321,00:06:04.906,-Pass. -Good riddance.
00:06:04.989,00:06:05.990,I don't believe in osmosis.
00:06:06.074,00:06:07.283,It's not brown-nosing.
00:06:07.366,00:06:08.743,She's the departing captain.
00:06:08.826,00:06:10.870,She did a lot for this squad.
00:06:10.953,00:06:13.498,"Oh, come on. Both of you sucked before she whipped you into shape."
00:06:13.581,00:06:15.750,"Oh, whipped? Is that what that was?"
00:06:15.833,00:06:18.628,"No one will miss Big Red, Tor. She puts the itch in bitch."
00:06:18.711,00:06:21.172,She puts the whore in horrifying.
00:06:21.255,00:06:23.758,"You know, it's her last practice. How would you feel?"
00:06:23.841,00:06:25.468,Big Red has no feelings.
00:06:25.551,00:06:27.428,Just testicles.
00:06:27.512,00:06:30.807,You guys are all great athletes.
00:06:30.890,00:06:34.560,Thanks in large part to me.
00:06:35.061,00:06:39.857,And I know that your new captain will keep the tradition alive.
00:06:39.941,00:06:45.780,"Leading you to the record sixth national cheerleading championship, you know is yours."
00:06:45.863,00:06:50.701,"So, let's meet your new leader, Torrance Shipman."
00:06:56.999,00:06:58.126,That slut.
00:06:58.626,00:07:00.670,"Okay, Listen up! I'd like to try a Wolf Wall."
00:07:00.753,00:07:02.588,"-Oh, excellent! -Okay, yeah! We're all going to die."
00:07:02.672,00:07:04.423,"Torrance has got the fever, people."
00:07:04.507,00:07:06.008,What's a Wolf's Wall?
00:07:06.092,00:07:08.970,Only the hardest pyramid known to cheerleading and mankind.
00:07:09.053,00:07:11.180,The words big and britches come to mind.
00:07:11.264,00:07:13.391,She's crazy. She'll kill us all.
00:07:13.474,00:07:16.602,Hello! Some of us have not spent the entire summer working out.
00:07:16.686,00:07:17.812,"Right, Carver?"
00:07:17.895,00:07:20.648,"Come on, guys! Let's be different for once."
00:07:20.731,00:07:22.233,We can't just rest on our laurels.
00:07:22.316,00:07:23.526,Why does everybody say that?
00:07:23.609,00:07:25.027,Maybe a laurel's a good place to rest.
00:07:25.611,00:07:28.531,"Come on, man. You guys suck. Let's do this."
00:07:30.783,00:07:34.203,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
00:07:35.204,00:07:37.498,"Five, six, seven, eight! Kick one."
00:07:37.582,00:07:39.375,Carver!
00:07:39.459,00:07:42.545,"Five, six, seven, eight! And one! Stick it!"
00:07:42.628,00:07:44.088,"Come on, girls! Stick it for me!"
00:07:45.339,00:07:47.049,"Five, six, seven, eight!"
00:07:47.133,00:07:51.721,"Go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Kick one!"
00:07:51.804,00:07:53.347,Good job! Whoo!
00:07:53.431,00:07:55.099,Pinch some panties. Someone's slacking.
00:07:55.183,00:07:56.350,Do I look like a milkmaid?
00:07:56.434,00:07:58.311,'Cause somebody feels like a cow!
00:07:58.394,00:07:59.854,"Carver, can you cradle out?"
00:07:59.937,00:08:01.647,You bet I can.
00:08:02.148,00:08:04.775,"Okay, ready? One, two, down, up!"
00:08:13.618,00:08:15.328,Carver?
00:08:15.411,00:08:16.704,Are you okay?
00:08:16.787,00:08:18.623,"I'm fine, really."
00:08:18.706,00:08:21.459,Don't you guys worry about me. It's just a scratch.
00:08:21.542,00:08:25.505,"I'll be back to practice tomorrow, so don't you guys fret, okay?"
00:08:29.300,00:08:31.385,"I promise, you guys. I'm gonna be there for you."
00:08:31.469,00:08:32.887,You hear me?
00:08:32.970,00:08:34.889,Guys?
00:08:42.396,00:08:43.523,I got captain.
00:08:43.606,00:08:46.400,"Yeah, and you sent a girl to the hospital on your first day."
00:08:46.484,00:08:47.944,"Aye, aye, Captain!"
00:08:48.027,00:08:50.238,You were listening on the phone? Mom!
00:08:51.781,00:08:54.408,"She really should get her own private line, you know."
00:08:54.492,00:08:56.536,She's growing up so fast.
00:08:57.119,00:08:58.788,"Justin, go away."
00:09:00.623,00:09:02.458,"-At ease, Captain. -Oh, shut up."
00:09:03.125,00:09:06.295,"Well, this blistering academic schedule shouldn't get in your way."
00:09:06.379,00:09:08.005,You should be happy about that.
00:09:08.089,00:09:10.758,Why can't you accept the fact that I'm not a genius?
00:09:10.841,00:09:12.760,It just kills you that I'm not an honor student.
00:09:12.843,00:09:16.055,No. It kills me that you barely make time to study.
00:09:16.138,00:09:19.267,"If you studied half as much as you cheer, you'd be in great shape."
00:09:19.350,00:09:23.604,Your priorities are… No! Those are your priorities! Mine are just fine.
00:09:23.688,00:09:32.113,"Look, I'm just saying that college might be less of a shock if you take an extra lab or language course or something."
00:09:32.196,00:09:33.155,What do you think?
00:09:33.739,00:09:35.491,Will Advanced Chem get you off my back?
00:09:35.575,00:09:37.868,"Not completely, but it'll help."
00:09:38.452,00:09:39.912,Done.
00:09:39.996,00:09:44.500,"You know, mothers have killed to get their daughters on squads."
00:09:44.584,00:09:47.545,That mother didn't kill anyone. She hired a hit man.
00:09:59.807,00:10:00.850,Hmm.
00:10:00.933,00:10:05.479,"Everyone, we have a new student transferring from Mission Hills High School in Los Angeles."
00:10:06.063,00:10:08.774,Please welcome Cliff Pant-One.
00:10:10.067,00:10:11.360,Pantone.
00:10:14.238,00:10:15.615,Thanks.
00:10:18.409,00:10:19.410,Loser!
00:10:24.749,00:10:26.250,Loser!
00:10:29.086,00:10:34.091,"Wait, wait, wait. Was that, uh… Was that the loser sneeze I just heard right there?"
00:10:34.175,00:10:36.218,"Guys, come on."
00:10:36.302,00:10:37.928,"I mean, what is that, from like the 1900s?"
00:10:38.012,00:10:41.390,Nobody does that anymore. I don't think anybody does.
00:10:41.474,00:10:45.269,When I lived in Kentucky… Did they still do the loser sneeze in Kentucky?
00:10:45.353,00:10:48.522,"No. They had, uh, guns and homemade bombs."
00:10:49.565,00:10:52.193,"There was a lot of attitude in LA, but no loser sneeze."
00:10:52.276,00:10:55.363,I'm pretty sure the loser sneeze is officially dead.
00:10:55.446,00:10:56.822,Sorry.
00:10:59.241,00:11:00.242,Loser!
00:11:01.911,00:11:03.287,Nice.
00:11:04.955,00:11:07.958,I don't think they got the memo about the loser sneeze.
00:11:09.043,00:11:11.170,"Uh, no, apparently not."
00:11:12.421,00:11:13.839,Cliff.
00:11:13.923,00:11:14.965,Torrance.
00:11:16.133,00:11:18.219,Advanced Chem. Yikes.
00:11:18.302,00:11:20.513,"Um, afraid so."
00:11:21.389,00:11:23.224,Are you intimidated?
00:11:23.307,00:11:25.393,"Yeah, a little."
00:11:25.476,00:11:27.603,"-Really? -No, not really."
00:11:29.313,00:11:31.941,"So, is that your band or something?"
00:11:33.109,00:11:40.825,"The Clash? No, uh… It's a British punk band, circa 1977 to 1983-ish."
00:11:40.908,00:11:42.159,"Original lineup, anyway."
00:11:42.743,00:11:43.994,How vintage.
00:11:50.835,00:11:53.462,"Um, so I'll see you around then?"
00:11:53.546,00:11:55.339,Looks like it.
00:11:57.716,00:11:59.051,"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
00:11:59.135,00:12:03.764,"Whoa! It's sexy Leslie and Jan, Jan, the cheerleading man."
00:12:03.848,00:12:05.266,"Hey, fags."
00:12:05.349,00:12:09.854,"Whoa, whoa. Just because we won more trophies than you guys, that's no reason to go get all malignant."
00:12:09.937,00:12:11.522,"Malignant this, tool."
00:12:12.565,00:12:14.608,"-Nice. -Oh, right on!"
00:12:14.692,00:12:16.068,"One of these days, man."
00:12:16.152,00:12:17.278,Let it go.
00:12:17.361,00:12:19.196,They never even won a single game.
00:12:19.280,00:12:21.407,It's gotta be kinda rough on them.
00:12:21.490,00:12:22.950,"-Besides, they're dicks. -Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:23.033,00:12:25.327,"Les, tell me you have Advanced Chem first period."
00:12:25.411,00:12:26.787,"Advanced Chem, first period."
00:12:26.871,00:12:28.622,"If you have a lab partner already, I'm screwed."
00:12:28.706,00:12:33.627,"Torrance, it's only the second day of school, and your academic insecurity bit is completely tired."
00:12:35.671,00:12:39.383,"You know, everyone's saying your ambition broke Carver's leg."
00:12:39.467,00:12:42.470,"When, really, it was the angle at which she slammed into the ground."
00:12:42.553,00:12:45.139,Kasey did a massive e-mail last night. Misspelled leg.
00:12:45.222,00:12:46.265,Shut up!
00:12:46.348,00:12:47.808,Two G's.
00:12:48.309,00:12:51.145,"Apparently, Carver gets home schooling for the next three months."
00:12:51.228,00:12:52.813,I'm cursed.
00:12:52.897,00:12:54.857,Replacing her is gonna be a nightmare.
00:12:54.940,00:12:57.526,"Well, that's why you're the captain, Captain."
00:12:58.194,00:13:01.322,"Bring on the tyros, the neophytes and the dilettanti."
00:13:01.405,00:13:03.157,"SATs are over, Darcy."
00:13:03.240,00:13:05.201,And you're still jealous of my score.
00:13:05.284,00:13:06.952,Are we sure Carver's not malingering?
00:13:07.036,00:13:10.164,Carver will strictly be cheering in Special Olympics until March.
00:13:10.247,00:13:11.707,Nationals are February 10th.
00:13:11.790,00:13:13.667,"Regionals are in, like, four weeks."
00:13:13.751,00:13:14.960,I talked to her. She's cool with this.
00:13:15.044,00:13:18.464,Don't tell me Carver can cut school just because she broke her leg in three places.
00:13:18.547,00:13:20.341,Hello! Get a wheelchair!
00:13:20.424,00:13:21.634,That lucky bitch.
00:13:21.717,00:13:25.179,Tell me we're not actually continuing this masquerade and having tryouts.
00:13:25.262,00:13:28.015,Let's cut the crap and pick somebody now.
00:13:28.098,00:13:30.434,Whitney's little sister Jamie is really teeny.
00:13:30.518,00:13:32.019,"She'll be easy to toss, and she doesn't give lip."
00:13:32.102,00:13:33.103,Just tongue.
00:13:33.187,00:13:34.396,"Oh, kiss my ass, Jan."
00:13:34.480,00:13:35.523,I'd love to.
00:13:35.606,00:13:37.399,"If she's the best, Jamie's got it."
00:13:37.483,00:13:39.527,But we have to see everyone.
00:13:39.610,00:13:41.195,"Ready, okay!"
00:13:41.278,00:13:43.113,Wait. Hold on.
00:13:43.197,00:13:44.782,Let me try that again. That was terrible.
00:13:44.865,00:13:46.825,"Ready, okay!"
00:13:46.909,00:13:52.039,"Go, team… Ready, okay!"
00:13:52.540,00:13:53.374,Sorry.
00:13:53.457,00:13:55.251,"Ready, okay!"
00:13:56.085,00:13:57.211,Shit.
00:13:57.294,00:13:59.213,Be aggressive.
00:13:59.296,00:14:01.048,"Be, be aggressive."
00:14:01.131,00:14:03.050,How many cheers do we actually have to memorize?
00:14:03.133,00:14:04.343,Do we get paid for this?
00:14:04.426,00:14:06.262,"Oh, and do I have to provide my own uniform?"
00:14:13.852,00:14:15.437,And I see you guys are wearing red.
00:14:15.521,00:14:17.940,"Um, that just does not work for me."
00:14:18.023,00:14:20.276,"Ready, okay!"
00:14:23.237,00:14:25.155,Toros all the way!
00:14:26.949,00:14:30.077,I'm sorry. I just broke up with my boyfriend.
00:14:34.748,00:14:36.375,Pretty good.
00:15:00.065,00:15:01.609,Excuse me!
00:15:02.443,00:15:05.070,What's with the song?
00:15:08.407,00:15:09.658,No.
00:15:25.049,00:15:26.425,Hi.
00:15:36.060,00:15:38.062,"Okay, uh, any more questions?"
00:15:38.145,00:15:40.105,I think we're good.
00:15:40.856,00:15:42.524,-Here's our girl. -Mmm-hmm.
00:15:56.288,00:15:57.831,"Go, Toros!"
00:16:04.880,00:16:07.007,And do I really have to wear those little underwear things?
00:16:07.091,00:16:08.634,'Cause I don't like wearing underwear.
00:16:08.717,00:16:10.386,Thanks!
00:16:22.606,00:16:24.608,Excuse me. Where'd you park your Harley?
00:16:25.609,00:16:26.735,Get real.
00:16:26.819,00:16:29.363,Tattoos are strictly verboten.
00:16:30.572,00:16:31.615,Sorry.
00:16:41.125,00:16:43.669,I got bored during fourth period.
00:16:43.752,00:16:46.380,You need to fill one of these out.
00:16:46.463,00:16:47.881,Did it.
00:16:54.430,00:16:55.973,"Missy, is it?"
00:16:56.056,00:17:01.228,"Okay, before we start, I'm afraid we're gonna need to make sure you can do a standing back tuck."
00:17:01.311,00:17:04.231,"Standard procedure, you understand."
00:17:04.314,00:17:07.067,"Standing back handspring back tuck, okay?"
00:17:15.617,00:17:18.412,"Where's this girl from, Romania?"
00:17:18.495,00:17:20.080,Can she yell?
00:17:20.164,00:17:21.749,We'll try an oldie.
00:17:38.849,00:17:41.560,"Okay, so I've never cheered before. So what?"
00:17:41.643,00:17:43.479,How about something that actually requires neurons?
00:17:43.562,00:17:44.646,Do it.
00:17:44.730,00:17:51.070,"Front handspring, step out, round off, back handspring, step out, round off, back handspring, full twisting lay out."
00:18:15.385,00:18:17.262,Hey!
00:18:17.763,00:18:19.181,Missy is bank.
00:18:19.264,00:18:20.516,"Uh, bankrupt."
00:18:20.599,00:18:22.226,We've already so decided on Jamie.
00:18:22.309,00:18:23.435,Yeah.
00:18:23.519,00:18:26.146,"Courtney, this is not a democracy. It's a cheerocracy."
00:18:26.230,00:18:28.190,"I'm sorry, but I'm overruling you."
00:18:28.273,00:18:31.860,"You are being a cheertator, Torrance, and a pain in my ass!"
00:18:31.944,00:18:33.987,We already voted.
00:18:34.071,00:18:37.199,"Besides, Missy looks like an uber dyke."
00:18:44.540,00:18:46.416,"Courtney, I'm the captain."
00:18:46.500,00:18:49.670,"I'm pulling rank, and you can fall in line or not."
00:18:49.753,00:18:52.339,"If we're gonna be the best, we have to have the best."
00:18:52.422,00:18:54.842,Missy's the poo. So take a big whiff.
00:19:09.189,00:19:10.232,You.
00:19:10.315,00:19:12.192,And you.
00:19:12.276,00:19:15.154,"I mean, hi. I'm… A cheerleader."
00:19:15.779,00:19:19.032,"Uh, yeah. Head cheerleader, to be exact."
00:19:19.116,00:19:20.576,Wow.
00:19:20.659,00:19:21.785,"So, does Missy live here?"
00:19:21.869,00:19:24.746,"Uh, actually, she moved back to LA, yeah."
00:19:24.830,00:19:29.877,"Something about evil cheerleaders or… Look, I'm serious. We have to get her."
00:19:29.960,00:19:31.545,Is her drug dependency gonna be a problem?
00:19:31.628,00:19:35.090,"Cliff, shut up. What do you want?"
00:19:35.174,00:19:37.176,I want you on the squad.
00:19:38.510,00:19:39.720,You're the best. They know it.
00:19:39.803,00:19:41.263,They just reject the unfamiliar.
00:19:41.847,00:19:43.307,"Thanks, but, no, thanks."
00:19:43.390,00:19:45.893,"I mean, I plead temporary insanity."
00:19:45.976,00:19:47.394,"See, I'm a hard-core gymnast."
00:19:47.477,00:19:51.356,"No way jumping up and down, screaming, Go, team, go! is gonna satisfy me."
00:19:51.440,00:19:55.694,"Look, we're gymnasts, too, except no beam, no bars, no vault."
00:19:55.777,00:19:57.613,Sorry. Not interested.
00:19:58.614,00:19:59.948,What are you doing?
00:20:00.032,00:20:05.412,"Nothing, I just thought that it was interesting hearing Torrance's point of view."
00:20:05.495,00:20:06.538,How do you even know her?
00:20:06.622,00:20:08.749,We're old friends.
00:20:09.625,00:20:11.543,Ever been to a cheerleading competition?
00:20:11.627,00:20:13.378,"Oh, you mean like a football game?"
00:20:13.462,00:20:15.172,"No, not a game."
00:20:15.255,00:20:17.049,Those are like practices for us.
00:20:17.132,00:20:19.259,I'm talking about a tournament.
00:20:19.343,00:20:22.888,"ESPN cameras all around, hundreds of people in the crowds cheering."
00:20:22.971,00:20:26.558,"Wait, people cheering cheerleaders?"
00:20:26.642,00:20:29.102,That's right. Lots of people.
00:20:29.603,00:20:32.981,"Here's the deal, Missy. We're the shit. The best."
00:20:33.065,00:20:36.777,"We have fun, we work hard, and we win national championships."
00:20:36.860,00:20:39.988,I'm offering you a chance to be a part of that.
00:20:40.072,00:20:42.741,"Think about it, Miss. I mean, you get to wear sassy outfits."
00:20:42.824,00:20:45.994,You get to yell like you care about something.
00:20:47.037,00:20:49.164,She's not the cheering type.
00:20:50.540,00:20:52.251,You know what?
00:20:53.794,00:20:55.420,Count me in.
00:20:58.006,00:21:00.634,"Ready, girls?"
00:21:21.238,00:21:22.406,"Here we go, girls."
00:21:33.417,00:21:35.502,"Nice recruit, Torrance."
00:21:36.003,00:21:39.506,"A real captain would've seen what I saw, a big dykey loser."
00:21:39.589,00:21:41.800,I'd say that's strike two.
00:21:49.683,00:21:50.976,What the hell is up?
00:21:51.059,00:21:52.686,"I went out on a limb for you, and you just bail?"
00:21:53.270,00:21:54.521,I'm not about stealing.
00:21:54.604,00:21:55.939,What are you talking about?
00:21:56.023,00:21:57.482,You ripped off those cheers.
00:21:57.566,00:22:00.652,"Listen, Missy, our cheers are 100% original."
00:22:00.736,00:22:02.195,Count the trophies.
00:22:02.279,00:22:04.781,"Well, your trophies are bullshit, because you're a sad-ass liar."
00:22:05.365,00:22:06.533,"All right, that's it! Get out of the car!"
00:22:06.616,00:22:08.702,I'm gonna kick your ass!
00:22:08.785,00:22:10.329,"Oh, really?"
00:22:12.664,00:22:14.124,Come on.
00:22:15.417,00:22:17.711,You're in for a rude awakening.
00:22:17.794,00:22:20.172,-Get in. -What? No way.
00:22:21.173,00:22:23.008,For real. Get in.
00:24:02.899,00:24:04.151,Hey!
00:24:04.818,00:24:06.153,You guys enjoy the show?
00:24:06.236,00:24:08.697,"Yes, were the ethnic festivities to your liking today?"
00:24:09.281,00:24:10.157,You guys are awesome.
00:24:10.240,00:24:12.450,Really? You're ready to share those trophies?
00:24:12.534,00:24:15.662,Can we just beat these Buffys down so I can go home?
00:24:15.745,00:24:17.080,"I'm on curfew, girl."
00:24:17.164,00:24:18.623,"Look, there's no need for that."
00:24:19.207,00:24:20.333,"Oh, you know what? She's right."
00:24:20.417,00:24:21.960,"See, then we'd be doing them a favor."
00:24:22.043,00:24:25.046,"See, then they could feel good about sending Raggedy Ann up here to jack us for our cheers."
00:24:25.130,00:24:26.339,Raggedy Ann?
00:24:26.423,00:24:29.217,Ugly redhead with a video camera permanently attached to her hand.
00:24:29.301,00:24:31.553,"Y'all have been coming up here for years, trying to steal our routines."
00:24:31.636,00:24:34.222,And we just love seeing them on ESPN.
00:24:34.306,00:24:36.141,"-What are you talking about? -Brrr, it's cold in here."
00:24:36.224,00:24:38.685,I said there must be some Toros in the atmosphere?
00:24:38.768,00:24:40.604,I know you didn't think a white girl made that shit up.
00:24:40.687,00:24:43.231,I… Our free cheer service is over as of this moment.
00:24:45.025,00:24:50.864,"God, it's like, every time we get some, here y'all come, trying to steal it, putting blonde hair on it and calling it something different."
00:24:50.947,00:24:54.201,"We've had the best squad around for years, but no one's been able to see what we can do."
00:24:54.284,00:24:56.620,"Oh, but you better believe all that's gonna change this year."
00:24:56.703,00:24:59.664,"I'm captain, and I guarantee you we'll make it to Nationals."
00:25:00.248,00:25:02.918,"So, just hand over the tape you made tonight and we'll call it even for now."
00:25:03.001,00:25:04.336,We don't have any tape.
00:25:04.419,00:25:05.795,Really. We just came to see the show.
00:25:05.879,00:25:09.591,"What? Come on, Isis. Let me do this."
00:25:09.674,00:25:13.470,You know what? Let's go.
00:25:13.553,00:25:15.972,Wait a minute. So that's it?
00:25:16.056,00:25:17.891,We're just gonna let them go?
00:25:17.974,00:25:22.062,"Yeah, because unlike them, we have class."
00:25:23.021,00:25:24.731,I swear I had no idea.
00:25:25.315,00:25:27.025,"Well, now you do."
00:25:31.071,00:25:33.198,"You been touched by an angel, girl."
00:25:33.698,00:25:34.574,"Jenelope, let's go."
00:25:34.658,00:25:44.876,I can't believe those white girls just came up here… We just so almost got our asses kicked back there!
00:25:44.960,00:25:46.795,"I mean, I knew I'd seen those routines before."
00:25:46.878,00:25:48.713,We used to play East Compton all the time.
00:25:51.883,00:25:53.802,"You really had no idea, did you?"
00:25:53.885,00:25:55.303,Do you know what this means?
00:25:56.805,00:25:59.391,My entire cheerleading career has been a lie.
00:25:59.891,00:26:01.601,"Well, look on the bright side."
00:26:01.685,00:26:03.270,It's only cheerleading.
00:26:03.770,00:26:05.355,I am only cheerleading.
00:26:09.901,00:26:11.611,Do you believe in curses?
00:26:11.695,00:26:12.946,What are you talking about?
00:26:14.447,00:26:16.491,I think I'm cursed.
00:26:16.574,00:26:17.867,And why is that?
00:26:19.035,00:26:24.416,"This past summer at cheer camp, all the new seniors had to do a dare."
00:26:27.794,00:26:30.046,"and it can never, ever touch the ground."
00:26:30.130,00:26:42.350,"Torrance Shipman, your mission, should you choose to accept it, and you better, is to capture the spirit stick and drop it in front of the entire camp."
00:27:01.411,00:27:04.039,Y'all are such an inspiration to us.
00:27:04.122,00:27:13.173,"Well, I just wanted to congratulate you guys and take a picture of you… with the spirit stick."
00:27:15.800,00:27:16.760,Here.
00:27:37.530,00:27:38.448,Here.
00:27:38.531,00:27:40.116,I don't want it now.
00:27:40.200,00:27:43.620,"No, it's okay. The spirit stick doesn't lose anything."
00:27:43.703,00:27:48.666,"The person who drops it, however, goes to Hades!"
00:27:52.879,00:27:56.508,"I don't mean to laugh, but cheerleading urban legends?"
00:27:57.258,00:28:01.012,You're not jinxed. Shit happens.
00:28:08.812,00:28:10.063,"Hey, I have to tell you something."
00:28:10.146,00:28:11.231,"I'm on the phone, creep."
00:28:11.314,00:28:15.318,"I realize that, and normally I'd be listening on the other line, but this is important."
00:28:15.402,00:28:17.112,"Okay, what?"
00:28:17.195,00:28:18.863,Oh! Get out!
00:28:18.947,00:28:20.365,Thank you for listening.
00:28:24.160,00:28:25.537,-Is Aaron around? -Back later.
00:28:25.620,00:28:26.913,-Do you know when? -No.
00:28:26.996,00:28:28.248,Have him call Torrance. It's urgent.
00:28:28.331,00:28:29.874,All right.
00:28:29.958,00:28:31.751,Big Red totally screwed us!
00:28:31.835,00:28:33.670,I mean monster screwed us!
00:28:33.753,00:28:35.672,I put this to the entire squad.
00:28:35.755,00:28:37.090,Swear you guys didn't know?
00:28:38.550,00:28:40.260,"Big Red didn't exactly let any of us help with the routines, Torrance."
00:28:40.343,00:28:42.011,I cannot believe she did this.
00:28:42.095,00:28:44.139,I feel awful. It's depraved.
00:28:44.222,00:28:46.683,"I mean, those East Compton girls wanted to grill our asses."
00:28:46.766,00:28:48.560,"Big Red ran the show, man."
00:28:48.643,00:28:51.563,"I mean, we were just flying ignorami, for sobbing out loud."
00:28:51.646,00:28:54.274,We can't go to Regionals with a stolen routine.
00:28:54.357,00:28:55.358,It's too risky.
00:28:55.442,00:28:58.737,Changing the routine now would be total murder-suicide.
00:28:58.820,00:28:59.988,Seriously.
00:29:00.071,00:29:02.657,Let's not put the duh in dumb.
00:29:02.741,00:29:04.701,How are East Compton gonna prove anything?
00:29:04.784,00:29:06.619,You people are unbelievable.
00:29:06.703,00:29:08.621,"I mean, we're talking about cheating here."
00:29:08.705,00:29:12.125,"Sorry, new girl, but nobody hit your buzzer."
00:29:12.208,00:29:16.004,"Look, I hate to be predictable, but I don't give a shit."
00:29:16.087,00:29:18.965,We learned that routine fair and square.
00:29:19.048,00:29:20.258,We logged the man-hours.
00:29:20.341,00:29:23.762,Don't punish the squad for Big Red's mistake.
00:29:25.430,00:29:27.015,This isn't about cheating.
00:29:27.098,00:29:30.977,This is about winning. Everyone in favor of winning?
00:29:42.322,00:29:44.991,"I get what you're saying, Missy, but there's no time."
00:29:45.074,00:29:47.869,"If we don't do the routine, we've got nothing else."
00:29:47.952,00:29:50.246,"So, you in?"
00:29:56.127,00:29:57.504,Whatever.
00:30:05.887,00:30:07.138,Get out of here!
00:30:07.222,00:30:10.141,"Hey, this is the living room. It's public domain."
00:30:13.394,00:30:15.271,"Hey, may I please speak to Aaron? It's Torrance."
00:30:15.355,00:30:18.608,"He's not here. He's, uh… He's not here. Bye."
00:30:22.028,00:30:24.072,"I'll take Famous Losers for 200, Alex."
00:30:24.155,00:30:25.073,"Shut up, moron!"
00:30:25.156,00:30:29.160,It's not my fault you're in love with a big gay cheerleader who won't return your phone calls.
00:30:29.244,00:30:30.620,Aaron is not gay.
00:30:30.703,00:30:33.206,"Oh, so someone just made him become a cheerleader?"
00:30:33.289,00:30:35.291,He's just busy!
00:30:35.375,00:30:38.002,"Yeah, busy scamming on guys."
00:30:38.795,00:30:40.672,Give me that!
00:30:42.131,00:30:43.675,Bitch!
00:30:49.389,00:30:51.140,Where is she?
00:30:56.729,00:30:58.565,"-Oh, baby! -Oh!"
00:30:58.648,00:30:59.858,Whoo!
00:30:59.941,00:31:01.526,No way.
00:31:01.609,00:31:03.945,Sexy mama!
00:31:04.028,00:31:07.782,Whoo! Take it off!
00:31:07.866,00:31:09.200,Whoo!
00:31:10.493,00:31:13.162,"Come on. Go, sexy."
00:31:14.831,00:31:18.042,"Whoo! You're on fire, yeah!"
00:31:19.502,00:31:21.212,You sure I can stay over at your house tonight?
00:31:21.296,00:31:23.423,Totally fine. My parents are at some benefit.
00:31:23.506,00:31:25.758,They'll be pouring themselves into bed around dawn.
00:31:25.842,00:31:27.302,Good. We gotta start early.
00:31:27.385,00:31:29.929,You'll be a star cheerleader yet.
00:31:30.013,00:31:33.266,"You know, all the cheerleaders in the world wouldn't help our football team."
00:31:33.349,00:31:34.851,"Man, it's just wrong."
00:31:34.934,00:31:36.895,Cheering for them is just plain mean.
00:31:36.978,00:31:39.105,"Everybody comes to see you ladies, anyway."
00:31:39.188,00:31:41.149,Because we're such fine athletes.
00:31:41.232,00:31:42.442,"Oh, live with it."
00:31:42.525,00:31:45.570,You'll be fighting off major oglers while we defend our sexuality.
00:31:45.653,00:31:47.947,What is your sexuality?
00:31:48.031,00:31:52.660,"Well, Jan's straight, while I'm controversial."
00:31:52.744,00:31:54.537,Are you trying to tell me you speak fag?
00:31:54.621,00:31:55.997,"Oh, fluently."
00:31:56.080,00:31:57.707,"And Courtney and Whitney, dyke-adelic?"
00:31:57.790,00:31:59.000,-No! -Are you kidding?
00:31:59.083,00:32:00.126,I don't think so.
00:32:00.209,00:32:03.338,"See, Courtney doesn't wear anything under her spankies."
00:32:03.421,00:32:04.797,"That's no excuse, Jan."
00:32:04.881,00:32:06.716,I can't help it if my digits slip occasionally.
00:32:07.842,00:32:09.928,Nuh-uh. Slip? Where?
00:32:10.011,00:32:12.263,"Oh, come on, Missy. Don't make him say it."
00:32:12.347,00:32:13.556,"Oh, my God."
00:32:13.640,00:32:14.724,"My God, too."
00:32:14.807,00:32:16.935,"You're a sick man, Jan."
00:32:17.018,00:32:23.566,"Now, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the Rancho Carne Toros!"
00:32:31.783,00:32:40.291,"And now, without further ado let's hear it for the five-time National Cheerleading Champions, the mighty Toros!"
00:32:54.013,00:32:56.766,Go! Go! Come on!
00:32:58.893,00:33:00.019,We're number one!
00:33:00.103,00:33:02.480,Come on! Let's hear it!
00:33:02.563,00:33:04.816,Whoo! Yeah!
00:33:06.401,00:33:08.861,"Bring it on, baby!"
00:33:08.945,00:33:11.155,Come on! Let's hear it! Come on!
00:33:13.324,00:33:14.784,"Go, Toros!"
00:33:18.788,00:33:21.124,"Come on, Toros! Whoo!"
00:33:21.207,00:33:22.792,"Go, Toros!"
00:33:24.711,00:33:26.504,"Come on, Toros!"
00:33:28.089,00:33:29.549,Come on. Yeah!
00:33:29.632,00:33:31.801,"Yeah, Toros! Yeah!"
00:33:34.721,00:33:36.681,Whoo!
00:33:37.181,00:33:39.392,"Come on, guys, let's do it!"
00:33:39.475,00:33:40.393,Ready?
00:33:43.479,00:33:45.398,Why don't you let your cheerleaders play for you?
00:33:45.481,00:33:48.067,"At least they win shit occasionally. Oh, man, is that the best you got?"
00:33:48.151,00:33:49.861,"Yeah, come on, bring it on, butt plug."
00:33:49.944,00:33:51.029,You want more? Okay.
00:33:51.112,00:33:55.199,"While we're out here kicking your ass, -your cheer boys are over there… -Ooh."
00:33:55.283,00:33:56.909,scamming on all your squirrel.
00:33:56.993,00:33:59.412,"Which is cool, since you don't have dicks anyway."
00:33:59.912,00:34:00.788,Mmm-hmm.
00:34:01.831,00:34:03.249,Bitch! Punk!
00:34:50.046,00:34:52.507,"Come on, guys! Touchdown! Let's go, yeah!"
00:34:56.761,00:34:58.054,Oh!
00:35:00.848,00:35:01.974,Nice.
00:35:07.438,00:35:09.190,Fourteen-nothing.
00:35:09.273,00:35:11.109,-Go! -Hut!
00:35:17.907,00:35:21.369,And with 4:50 left in the third quarter… Losers.
00:35:21.452,00:35:24.247,"It's Costa Mesa 34, Toros nothing."
00:35:25.832,00:35:26.833,Work!
00:35:30.378,00:35:31.379,Work!
00:35:49.939,00:35:51.107,Oh!
00:35:52.441,00:35:53.401,Ooh!
00:35:54.652,00:35:55.778,Jan!
00:35:57.947,00:36:00.575,"Go, Toros!"
00:36:01.325,00:36:02.535,Yeah!
00:36:04.412,00:36:06.247,"Come on, Toros!"
00:36:08.166,00:36:09.709,"You're, like, totally his eye candy."
00:36:09.792,00:36:11.878,"God, I can't believe you'd do that to Aaron."
00:36:11.961,00:36:12.837,Do what?
00:36:12.920,00:36:14.630,Especially with him.
00:36:14.714,00:36:16.257,What are you talking about?
00:36:16.757,00:36:19.051,"Oh, don't play dumb. We're better at it than you."
00:36:19.135,00:36:20.720,You're having cheer sex with him.
00:36:20.803,00:36:25.933,"Flag on the play, it's called against… You guessed it, the Toros."
00:36:26.017,00:36:30.062,"Remember, our next defeat is scheduled for next Friday night at 8:00."
00:36:31.355,00:36:33.524,"Let's go, Toros!"
00:36:34.275,00:36:36.360,"Let's go, Toros!"
00:36:37.737,00:36:39.155,"Let's go, Toros!"
00:36:40.531,00:36:42.742,"Let's go, Toros!"
00:36:43.409,00:36:45.036,All right!
00:37:29.413,00:37:31.832,I still say we use the routine we have.
00:37:31.916,00:37:33.626,"If we have to start over, I quit."
00:37:34.710,00:37:37.421,And that's the game.
00:37:37.505,00:37:40.132,"Whoever here is for a new routine, raise your hand."
00:37:40.216,00:37:44.762,"Final score. Cougars 42, Toros nothing."
00:37:51.978,00:37:53.604,"Dude, you just lost."
00:37:59.944,00:38:01.654,"So, is every game that eventful?"
00:38:01.737,00:38:03.155,No. Thank God.
00:38:03.239,00:38:05.283,We have a real situation on our hands.
00:38:05.366,00:38:07.243,"I mean, we were humiliated on our own turf."
00:38:07.827,00:38:09.870,We might have to have a rumble.
00:38:09.954,00:38:11.998,This is a serious problem!
00:38:12.081,00:38:14.583,"Oh, so is your breath."
00:38:14.667,00:38:16.627,"-Oh, my God. -Yeah."
00:39:08.429,00:39:09.305,What are you doing?
00:39:09.388,00:39:19.815,Um… Where's the bathroom?
00:39:19.899,00:39:21.484,Right there.
00:39:21.567,00:39:22.651,Oh!
00:40:47.069,00:40:48.571,Good night.
00:40:48.654,00:40:50.114,Night.
00:40:54.326,00:40:56.203,Are you into my brother?
00:40:56.287,00:40:58.372,No. I have a boyfriend.
00:41:25.316,00:41:26.358,Hello.
00:41:27.568,00:41:29.403,"Tor, is that you?"
00:41:29.487,00:41:31.447,Where have you been? I keep trying to call you.
00:41:31.530,00:41:35.075,"Yeah, I know. I've been, like, totally busy with school and practice and stuff."
00:41:35.159,00:41:37.369,"-What's up? -Oh, it's bad, Aaron."
00:41:37.453,00:41:40.372,Miss Red snaked our routines from the East Compton Clovers.
00:41:40.456,00:41:42.249,-All of our routines. -What?
00:41:42.333,00:41:43.584,And they found out about it.
00:41:43.667,00:41:46.295,They showed up at the game. Gauntlets were thrown.
00:41:46.378,00:41:49.131,"Tell me you didn't know about this. I mean, I don't know what to do here."
00:41:49.215,00:41:52.676,"Of course, I didn't know, but you gotta calm down."
00:41:52.760,00:41:54.470,This is not that big a deal.
00:41:54.553,00:41:56.555,Everybody uses everybody else's material.
00:41:56.639,00:41:58.557,It's like this unwritten rule or something.
00:41:58.641,00:42:00.059,That doesn't help me.
00:42:00.142,00:42:03.771,We can't do their routine at Regionals because they're gonna do their routine at Regionals.
00:42:03.854,00:42:06.106,"Come on, Tor, you need a new routine."
00:42:06.190,00:42:07.900,That's all. No problem.
00:42:07.983,00:42:09.693,Just hire a professional choreographer.
00:42:09.777,00:42:11.320,A choreographer?
00:42:11.403,00:42:12.988,"Look, just think of it as collaboration."
00:42:13.072,00:42:15.324,The UCA totally looks the other way.
00:42:15.407,00:42:19.370,Call this guy. His name is Sparky Polastri.
00:42:19.453,00:42:21.372,-Pen. -Remember Nationals last year?
00:42:21.455,00:42:24.250,"Knows his shit, all right? Here's the number."
00:42:24.333,00:42:27.211,It's 555-7219.
00:42:27.294,00:42:28.337,"Thanks, Aaron."
00:42:28.420,00:42:30.005,You always know what to do.
00:42:30.089,00:42:32.216,"Mmm-hmm. Bye, baby."
00:42:35.803,00:42:38.180,My sister. Mmm.
00:42:38.264,00:42:40.432,"But you're not my sister, are you?"
00:42:41.725,00:42:44.061,He says we should hire a choreographer.
00:42:47.439,00:42:49.817,Hi. May I please speak to Sparky Polastri?
00:42:49.900,00:42:52.444,He'll need three or four days to teach us the routine.
00:42:52.528,00:42:56.240,"But here's the thing. It's gonna cost us $2,000."
00:42:56.865,00:42:59.577,"What, do I have the letters A-T-M tattooed on my forehead?"
00:43:00.160,00:43:02.830,We were thinking more like D-A-D-D-Y.
00:43:04.415,00:43:06.083,Maybe I can get 500.
00:43:06.166,00:43:09.336,"Okay, then we only need 1500 more by Monday."
00:43:09.837,00:43:11.547,"What's up, Whitney?"
00:43:11.630,00:43:12.673,Hi.
00:43:14.883,00:43:16.635,raising a little money.
00:43:19.388,00:43:22.099,"Yeah, baby, yeah!"
00:43:23.267,00:43:24.268,"Work it, Kasey!"
00:43:24.351,00:43:25.811,"What's up, buddy?"
00:43:25.894,00:43:27.813,Come to mama.
00:43:27.896,00:43:29.106,Soak it up.
00:43:29.189,00:43:30.608,Working hard for our money?
00:43:30.691,00:43:31.984,"That's a good shot, Les."
00:43:32.067,00:43:33.611,You're right.
00:43:34.486,00:43:36.655,Giving it a little buff job. That's good.
00:43:37.239,00:43:38.991,"Oh, that's attractive, Tor."
00:43:39.074,00:43:41.368,Looking good. Shaking the booty.
00:43:45.247,00:43:47.333,"Missy, what the hell are you doing?"
00:43:51.629,00:43:52.921,Watch it!
00:43:54.423,00:43:56.759,"Dude, watch out for the camera."
00:44:12.858,00:44:15.361,Hand over your 15 bucks or get out of here.
00:44:15.444,00:44:16.445,What are you doing?
00:44:16.528,00:44:18.906,Making money from guys ogling my goodies.
00:44:18.989,00:44:20.866,"Aw, I didn't need to hear that. I didn't."
00:44:20.949,00:44:22.701,That was an over-share.
00:44:22.785,00:44:25.162,"Hey, Torrance. Come here a sec."
00:44:27.498,00:44:30.042,We'll just get this over with.
00:44:31.085,00:44:34.004,My brother wants to check out your rack.
00:44:35.214,00:44:38.217,"You know, I begged my mom for a brother."
00:44:38.300,00:44:40.678,"He'd look a little ridiculous in that bikini, wouldn't he?"
00:44:40.761,00:44:42.346,Yeah.
00:44:43.263,00:44:45.057,"So, nice car."
00:44:45.724,00:44:49.770,Yeah. Um… What can I say? I drive hard.
00:44:49.853,00:44:51.397,Shouldn't take long to wash.
00:44:51.480,00:44:54.024,"Oh, don't even worry about it. I got all afternoon."
00:44:54.108,00:44:56.110,I'll bet you do.
00:44:59.321,00:45:00.739,Where the hell is this guy?
00:45:00.823,00:45:02.866,"Listen, we're lucky he's even doing this for us."
00:45:52.332,00:45:53.750,Great.
00:45:57.671,00:45:59.882,-Thanks for coming. We're… -Don't speak.
00:46:05.888,00:46:08.098,You. You have weak ankles.
00:46:10.434,00:46:13.729,One of your calves is bigger than the other.
00:46:13.812,00:46:15.481,Too much makeup.
00:46:16.064,00:46:18.984,Not enough makeup. What's with the skin?
00:46:19.067,00:46:21.153,"Say it with me, Sunlight!"
00:46:23.363,00:46:25.782,Male cheerleaders. Enough said.
00:46:26.742,00:46:28.452,Smile.
00:46:29.453,00:46:31.038,Don't smile.
00:46:31.121,00:46:32.456,Jackass.
00:46:33.457,00:46:36.084,Good general tone and musculature.
00:46:39.796,00:46:44.843,Report those compliments to your ass before it gets so big it forms its own Web site.
00:46:47.638,00:46:53.060,"And you, I take you to be the captain, which means you'll probably need more work than anyone."
00:46:53.644,00:46:56.939,"-Look, you don't… -Shh… -But… -No, no, no, no, no."
00:46:57.022,00:46:59.775,Don't speak. Don't think.
00:46:59.858,00:47:02.152,Listen and learn.
00:47:08.116,00:47:10.452,I'm a choreographer.
00:47:10.536,00:47:12.371,That's what I do.
00:47:12.913,00:47:16.041,You are cheerleaders.
00:47:16.124,00:47:19.211,Cheerleaders are dancers who have gone retarded.
00:47:19.920,00:47:23.715,"What you do is a tiny, pathetic subset of dancing."
00:47:23.799,00:47:29.888,"I will attempt to transform your robotic routines into poetry, written with the human body."
00:47:29.972,00:47:33.767,"Follow me or perish, sweater monkeys."
00:47:35.060,00:47:38.105,I want you to think of what you ate today. Got it?
00:47:38.188,00:47:42.526,Now cut that in half. This is called a diet. Everyone start one today.
00:47:43.026,00:47:45.862,"Darcy, honey, you should stop eating."
00:47:45.946,00:47:49.533,"You see, when you skip a meal, your body feeds off its fat stores."
00:47:49.616,00:47:52.953,"And if you skip enough, maybe your body will eat your ass."
00:47:54.454,00:47:57.207,Why does everyone have to go on a diet?
00:47:57.791,00:48:03.130,"Because in cheerleading, we throw people in the air, and fat people don't go as high."
00:48:03.213,00:48:04.548,"Come on, come on. Let's get back to work!"
00:48:15.726,00:48:17.853,Hold her up! I want dangerous!
00:48:18.437,00:48:19.896,I wanna feel like somebody's gonna snap their neck!
00:48:20.480,00:48:23.609,Spirit fingers! Give me spirit fingers!
00:48:28.530,00:48:30.490,Ouch! Ouch!
00:48:30.574,00:48:32.326,What? I told you I'd catch you.
00:48:33.368,00:48:38.165,"Look, I understand you have underwear up your ass right now, but it beats the hell out of a shattered skull."
00:48:38.248,00:48:40.083,Think about it.
00:48:53.388,00:48:55.932,"Okay, now, spirit fingers. Spirit fingers!"
00:48:58.018,00:48:59.645,And spirit fingers!
00:49:05.692,00:49:06.526,"Oh, my God!"
00:49:06.610,00:49:09.196,These are not spirit fingers.
00:49:12.032,00:49:15.077,These are spirit fingers.
00:49:15.160,00:49:17.954,And these are gold.
00:49:18.497,00:49:22.167,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
00:49:22.250,00:49:25.796,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
00:49:25.879,00:49:26.880,Screw this.
00:49:26.963,00:49:29.299,I did not sign on for spirit fingers.
00:49:30.759,00:49:33.845,Come on! The spirit fingers are great!
00:49:33.929,00:49:35.347,"Yeah, whatever."
00:49:35.430,00:49:37.307,We are so screwed.
00:49:48.026,00:49:49.528,What's the matter?
00:49:49.611,00:49:50.987,You don't wanna know.
00:49:51.613,00:49:54.866,Ah! Cheer crisis.
00:49:56.243,00:50:00.247,I've just gotten so bogged down in all this crap.
00:50:00.872,00:50:04.126,"Well, if it's crap, why do you do it?"
00:50:06.128,00:50:07.087,I don't know.
00:50:07.170,00:50:08.964,So quit.
00:50:09.047,00:50:10.257,Maybe I should.
00:50:10.340,00:50:11.675,"Yeah, I mean, if you don't like it anymore."
00:50:11.758,00:50:13.552,I didn't say that.
00:50:13.635,00:50:14.803,Sounds like it.
00:50:16.304,00:50:18.223,I don't know what I want.
00:50:18.306,00:50:21.017,I remember back when I cheered at my school in Detroit.
00:50:21.601,00:50:23.061,You cheered at your other high school?
00:50:23.645,00:50:27.107,"No, I never cheered, but I know what you're going through."
00:50:27.190,00:50:36.825,"And regardless of all the politics and the doubts, and the crap, you just have to know that you can do it."
00:50:40.245,00:50:44.499,"And if it helps, I know you can."
00:50:45.876,00:50:47.043,You do?
00:50:47.836,00:50:49.171,Yeah.
00:50:52.966,00:50:55.385,"All right, all right! I'm ready to make a fool of myself."
00:50:57.012,00:50:59.222,"State regionals, here we come."
00:51:15.197,00:51:17.073,So much better than last year.
00:51:26.583,00:51:29.920,Welcome to the world of competitive cheerleading.
00:51:38.845,00:51:41.723,"High school divisions, please check the signs."
00:51:41.807,00:51:58.657,"If you're not here, your division will be… Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven… Broncos!"
00:52:22.055,00:52:24.057,Some of these uniforms look so skanky.
00:52:24.140,00:52:25.308,Whatever. They're white trash.
00:52:25.392,00:52:27.269,-Where do they get them? -They're white trash.
00:52:29.354,00:52:32.774,"Cutter, I'm gonna kick your ass, you evil whore!"
00:52:33.358,00:52:35.026,"Get over it, hag!"
00:52:35.110,00:52:37.237,She did not just hit me!
00:52:37.320,00:52:38.738,"No, she's a little kid."
00:52:38.822,00:52:42.325,You little… Get off me!
00:52:43.243,00:52:44.828,"-Leave me alone! -Stop it, Courtney!"
00:52:54.963,00:52:57.299,"Hi. You, yes."
00:52:57.382,00:52:58.884,Your head was down.
00:52:58.967,00:53:01.636,Your head was down during that move.
00:53:01.720,00:53:06.057,"How are you gonna give a proper score if you're not looking, if your head is down during a move?"
00:53:11.146,00:53:15.233,"Remember, they give extra points for alacrity and effulgence."
00:53:15.317,00:53:17.277,Did we bring those?
00:53:17.861,00:53:19.321,"Oh, no. Look who's here."
00:53:29.956,00:53:30.874,Hi.
00:53:39.007,00:53:40.258,We're in trouble.
00:53:42.052,00:53:47.557,"at the UCA California Regionals, the East Compton Clovers!"
00:53:48.558,00:53:50.143,"Yeah, Clovers!"
00:54:28.765,00:54:29.766,Stop.
00:54:56.209,00:55:00.922,"I'm standing here with five-time national returning champions, the Rancho Carne Toros."
00:55:04.300,00:55:07.262,Leading the squad this year is senior Torrance Shipman.
00:55:07.345,00:55:12.934,"Torrance, one of the things we've come to expect from the Toros over the last few years is a highly original routine."
00:55:13.018,00:55:14.227,Can we expect the same this year?
00:55:14.310,00:55:21.234,"Well, I think everyone goes out there the same way, being as prepared as they can be and just hoping for the best."
00:55:21.317,00:55:25.030,"We're just glad to be back here, and eager to see what some of the other squads have come up with."
00:55:26.781,00:55:28.867,Prepare for total domination!
00:55:28.950,00:55:30.410,Isn't that Sparky?
00:55:30.493,00:55:33.288,"Well, thank you, Rancho Carne Toros, and good luck."
00:55:33.371,00:55:35.081,"-And now, the Mighty Muskrats… -Thanks."
00:55:35.165,00:55:37.667,of Mesa Cucamonga!
00:55:43.798,00:55:45.133,Spirit fingers.
00:55:45.216,00:55:47.343,They stole our routine!
00:56:18.208,00:56:20.418,Keep that Trojan spirit up!
00:56:20.502,00:56:22.420,Pump! Pump! Pump it up!
00:56:22.504,00:56:24.297,-It's the curse. -What?
00:56:24.380,00:56:25.465,The spirit stick curse.
00:56:25.548,00:56:26.758,"Oh, God, will you lay off with that?"
00:56:26.841,00:56:28.968,"There's no curse, and you're not going to Hades."
00:56:29.052,00:56:31.429,News flash! Look around. We are in Hades!
00:56:31.513,00:56:34.224,Rancho Carne! You're up next!
00:56:38.728,00:56:44.275,"the five-time national champions, the Rancho Carne Toros!"
00:56:44.359,00:56:46.361,Yeah! Yeah!
00:56:49.155,00:56:50.532,I bet this is good.
00:57:05.922,00:57:07.632,Didn't we just see this routine?
00:58:19.829,00:58:21.831,What the f…?
00:58:35.136,00:58:36.679,"Go, Toros!"
00:58:37.263,00:58:38.223,Think they screwed up.
00:58:40.058,00:58:42.810,"That was, um, interesting."
00:58:43.520,00:58:46.231,Y'all should've just stuck with our routines.
00:58:46.314,00:58:47.148,Yeah.
00:58:47.232,00:58:49.192,Don't worry. We'll send you a postcard from Nationals.
00:58:53.613,00:58:54.906,-Torrance Shipman? -Yes.
00:58:54.989,00:58:56.699,"Tad Freeman, Universal Cheer Association."
00:58:56.783,00:58:58.159,We have a problem.
00:58:58.243,00:58:59.619,A problem?
00:59:01.663,00:59:02.747,Hey.
00:59:04.624,00:59:09.254,the incredible sense of déja vu I experienced as I was watching that last routine.
00:59:09.337,00:59:11.130,I wouldn't just now.
00:59:12.006,00:59:14.425,-What? -Official cheer business.
00:59:14.509,00:59:16.970,"Come on. It's me. Hey, Torrance!"
00:59:17.053,00:59:20.348,"You see, I… Not now."
00:59:20.431,00:59:23.017,That was smooth. Real smooth.
00:59:23.601,00:59:24.686,I'll see her later.
00:59:24.769,00:59:26.312,All righty.
00:59:29.607,00:59:32.986,"Oh, uh, by the way, nice spirit fingers."
00:59:33.069,00:59:35.154,"Yeah. Well, here's another."
00:59:38.157,00:59:39.325,Thanks.
00:59:39.409,00:59:43.079,Obviously your Toros aren't the only squad with this particular routine.
00:59:43.663,00:59:48.501,Does the name Sparky Polastri mean anything to you?
00:59:48.585,00:59:50.086,-Sparky Polastri? -Mmm-hmm.
00:59:50.169,00:59:53.881,Apparently he's been peddling this same routine up and down the California coast.
00:59:53.965,00:59:56.009,Six squads total.
00:59:56.593,00:59:59.554,We're holding an emergency session of the discretionary panel.
00:59:59.637,01:00:00.763,About what?
01:00:00.847,01:00:02.807,We've never had a situation like this before.
01:00:02.890,01:00:05.768,"We really should disqualify you and… No, no, don't punish the squad."
01:00:05.852,01:00:07.979,"It was my choice to hire Sparky, not theirs."
01:00:08.062,01:00:10.064,Don't penalize everyone for my bad judgment.
01:00:10.148,01:00:14.611,"But since there's no precedent for this, there's nothing in the rule books that forbids it."
01:00:14.694,01:00:16.863,It's simply frowned upon.
01:00:16.946,01:00:19.866,And I suppose we can't disqualify you on those grounds alone.
01:00:19.949,01:00:24.537,"As defending champions, you are guaranteed a bid to Florida, but know that we'll be watching you."
01:00:25.121,01:00:28.082,And don't expect to show up at finals with that routine.
01:00:31.586,01:00:34.005,What are you doing? You're wrecking everything I built!
01:00:34.088,01:00:38.801,"Hey, hey, hey, it's not totally her fault. I was the one that hooked up… This season should have been gravy, okay?"
01:00:38.885,01:00:41.888,"I handpicked the squad, I delivered an idiot-proof routine."
01:00:41.971,01:00:43.848,"Platter, Nationals, hello!"
01:00:43.931,01:00:45.767,Don't you mean a stolen routine?
01:00:45.850,01:00:48.519,"Don't be so naive, Torrance."
01:00:48.603,01:00:51.356,"Look, the truth is I was a real leader, okay?"
01:00:51.439,01:00:57.904,"I did what I had to do to win at Nationals, and ever since I handed the reins over to you, you've run my squad straight into the ground!"
01:00:58.488,01:01:05.161,"If I made any mistake as a squad leader, it wasn't borrowing cheers, it was announcing you as my successor."
01:01:09.624,01:01:11.459,Uh-uh. Not cool.
01:01:14.128,01:01:16.339,"Hey, Tor. Tor. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
01:01:16.422,01:01:17.715,Let me go. I just wanna get out of here.
01:01:17.799,01:01:19.592,"Hey, Big Red's a bitch."
01:01:19.676,01:01:22.553,We all know that. Even she knows that.
01:01:22.637,01:01:24.347,"I don't know what to do here, Aaron."
01:01:24.430,01:01:28.559,"Look. I know I haven't always been there for you, since I went to college."
01:01:28.643,01:01:31.604,"It's been a rough transition, for both of us."
01:01:31.688,01:01:35.274,"But I still care about you as much as I ever did. You know that, right?"
01:01:35.358,01:01:37.193,-You do? -Of course.
01:01:37.276,01:01:40.071,"Which is why I hate to see you like this, all stressed out."
01:01:40.154,01:01:42.073,It's not good for you.
01:01:42.156,01:01:45.952,"You're a great cheerleader, Tor, and you're cute as hell."
01:01:47.120,01:01:54.711,It's just that maybe… Maybe.
01:01:55.878,01:02:00.508,"You're just not captain material, and there's nothing wrong with that."
01:02:00.591,01:02:03.386,Maybe you should consider letting Courtney and Whitney take over the squad.
01:02:03.469,01:02:04.971,They're just like Big Red.
01:02:05.054,01:02:06.931,You want me to give up captain?
01:02:07.014,01:02:09.475,"Hey, let them deal with the politics."
01:02:09.559,01:02:12.103,"You just do what you do best, Tor."
01:02:12.186,01:02:13.229,You cheer.
01:02:14.272,01:02:17.066,"Cheer, Tor. Okay?"
01:02:18.192,01:02:20.403,I just wanna see you happy.
01:02:34.083,01:02:35.418,Bye.
01:02:43.885,01:02:45.928,"Sleep tight, sweetie."
01:03:07.116,01:03:08.659,Friend of yours?
01:03:10.411,01:03:11.954,He's my boyfriend.
01:03:14.624,01:03:16.250,"Look, Cliff, I can explain."
01:03:16.834,01:03:18.377,No. It's cool.
01:03:23.674,01:03:26.719,"Here, um, I made you a tape, too."
01:03:29.764,01:04:08.928,"Cliff… Hey, Torrance, uh, it's me, Cliff."
01:04:09.011,01:04:13.724,"Um, here's… I wrote something for you, so here it is."
01:05:28.674,01:05:30.051,Aaron called us last night.
01:05:30.134,01:05:32.720,He told us you're turning the squad over to us.
01:05:32.803,01:05:38.309,"We want you know that just because you bit the big one as captain, does not mean we're gonna be super hard on you."
01:05:38.392,01:05:41.646,-Oh! -We'll treat you as if you didn't screw us into the ground.
01:05:41.729,01:05:43.356,"Gee, thanks."
01:05:43.856,01:05:47.026,"Everyone, Torrance is not to be harmed."
01:05:47.109,01:05:49.570,We've already decided on a course of action.
01:05:50.154,01:05:52.239,We're gonna forego Nationals this year.
01:05:52.323,01:05:54.158,Everyone's already agreed to it.
01:05:54.241,01:05:56.160,"-Uh, except me. -And me!"
01:05:56.243,01:05:57.662,Both of you can be replaced.
01:05:57.745,01:05:59.872,I can't believe you guys.
01:05:59.956,01:06:05.086,"The only person who can officially resign the post of captain is the captain, and I'm not going anywhere."
01:06:05.169,01:06:06.837,Then we'll have to overthrow you.
01:06:06.921,01:06:07.838,Which we will!
01:06:08.422,01:06:10.216,Enough!
01:06:10.299,01:06:16.013,"Our whole cheering career, we've staked our reputation on being the best, the most inventive."
01:06:16.597,01:06:21.435,"Now we finally have a chance to truly be original, and you're all running scared."
01:06:24.563,01:06:26.732,and I'm not resigning as captain either.
01:06:26.816,01:06:28.359,You're gonna have to kill me first.
01:06:28.442,01:06:30.236,That can be arranged.
01:06:30.319,01:06:32.446,"Shut it, Whitney! Let her talk!"
01:06:36.033,01:06:40.037,"but I believe in this squad, and I know we can bounce back from this."
01:06:40.121,01:06:42.665,I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
01:06:42.748,01:06:44.500,It's gonna be hard work.
01:06:44.583,01:06:50.923,"We need a new routine, something amazing and fresh, and we've got less than three weeks till Nationals."
01:06:51.465,01:06:57.388,"But if we can do it, if we can pull this off, then we can really call ourselves original."
01:06:57.972,01:06:59.306,Now who's with me?
01:07:03.060,01:07:04.478,"How about it, girls?"
01:07:04.562,01:07:06.689,It's gonna be hard without you two.
01:07:07.982,01:07:09.316,Fine.
01:07:10.651,01:07:12.695,Sure. Whatever.
01:07:12.778,01:07:14.780,Okay. Let's do this.
01:07:18.117,01:07:21.912,"before school, in between classes and after school."
01:07:21.996,01:07:25.124,Afternoon practices will have to be twice as long.
01:07:25.207,01:07:28.335,We've gotta do whatever it takes to be in perfect physical shape.
01:07:28.419,01:07:30.254,Yeah. You can go a little harder.
01:07:30.337,01:07:31.297,"There, there."
01:07:31.380,01:07:32.590,"Yeah, that feels good."
01:07:32.673,01:07:34.717,Maybe we should join the squad.
01:07:36.886,01:07:38.304,Fag!
01:07:43.267,01:07:45.936,"we'll use night games to practice, too."
01:07:46.020,01:07:47.438,But that's not all.
01:07:47.521,01:07:58.741,"We're gonna study other types of movement, from swing dance, to interpretive dance… And you flow and you… …even mime."
01:07:58.824,01:08:03.704,"We'll draw inspiration from martial arts, musicals, everything."
01:08:05.706,01:08:07.750,You guys know we've got the talent.
01:08:08.542,01:08:12.421,We've just gotta work our asses off and trust our instincts.
01:08:13.214,01:08:15.257,All of our instincts.
01:08:23.349,01:08:25.059,Tor!
01:08:25.142,01:08:26.477,Wow! What are you doing here?
01:08:26.560,01:08:28.646,Just wanted to come by and see you.
01:08:28.729,01:08:29.897,Is this a bad time?
01:08:29.980,01:08:31.607,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:08:31.690,01:08:36.153,"I'm super busy. I'm working on this project… Yeah, you sound super busy."
01:08:36.237,01:08:37.655,I guess that's it.
01:08:37.738,01:08:40.116,You were too busy to believe in me.
01:08:40.199,01:08:41.992,"Oh, no, no, but wait."
01:08:42.076,01:08:45.788,"You weren't too busy to sell me out to Courtney and Whitney, were you?"
01:08:45.871,01:08:48.415,"Gee, now I'm confused."
01:08:48.499,01:08:51.710,"Well, I hope you're not too busy to hear this."
01:08:52.378,01:08:55.172,"Kiss my ass, Aaron! It's over!"
01:09:00.928,01:09:03.097,"You're a great cheerleader, Aaron."
01:09:03.180,01:09:08.686,It's just that… Maybe you're not exactly boyfriend material.
01:09:08.769,01:09:10.187,Bye-bye.
01:09:23.492,01:09:26.370,UCA just posted the Nationals list on the Internet.
01:09:26.453,01:09:28.789,East Compton isn't on it.
01:09:28.873,01:09:32.251,They couldn't raise the money in time. They're not going.
01:09:32.334,01:09:34.128,"What do you mean, They're not going?"
01:09:34.211,01:09:36.005,"Torrance, that's good news."
01:09:36.088,01:09:38.174,They cannot not go. That's not good news.
01:09:38.257,01:09:39.508,What are you talking about?
01:09:39.592,01:09:41.594,"They don't go, we win. Once again we're the best."
01:09:41.677,01:09:45.472,I define best as competing against the best there is out there and beating them.
01:09:46.140,01:09:47.892,They have to go.
01:09:48.893,01:09:53.689,It's so unfair. The first inter-city squad to get a bid to Nationals and they can't afford to go?
01:09:53.772,01:09:56.108,"Look, Mom. Her head is spinning off into another dimension."
01:09:57.151,01:09:59.445,"The company gets hit up for money all the time, honey."
01:09:59.528,01:10:00.613,I just can't.
01:10:00.696,01:10:03.240,"It's not that much money, Mr. Level-Playing-Field."
01:10:03.324,01:10:05.451,Tell them the deal. Maybe they'll wanna help.
01:10:05.534,01:10:09.830,"Yeah? Okay, I'll make the call, but I'll tell you, they'll probably say no."
01:10:09.914,01:10:10.915,Don't let them.
01:10:10.998,01:10:13.250,Think of how much it'll mean to East Compton.
01:10:13.334,01:10:15.127,They deserve to go.
01:10:15.211,01:10:17.671,"Do the right thing, Dad!"
01:10:22.134,01:10:23.886,Did that just happen?
01:10:23.969,01:10:25.179,Yeah.
01:10:25.262,01:10:28.057,"Where we come from, cheer is not a word we hear very often."
01:10:28.140,01:10:30.935,They should call us inspiration leaders instead.
01:10:31.018,01:10:33.062,"Oh, that's deep. I like that."
01:10:33.145,01:10:34.772,I don't know why we writing to some talk-show host.
01:10:34.855,01:10:36.649,It's like we begging for charity or something.
01:10:36.732,01:10:39.109,It's not charity. Pauletta Patton's from our neighborhood.
01:10:39.193,01:10:41.028,She'll understand why we need the money.
01:10:41.111,01:10:42.238,Tell her we need to buy donuts.
01:10:42.321,01:10:43.948,Her big butt will understand that.
01:10:44.031,01:10:46.242,"Ha-ha! Stop being counterproductive, all right?"
01:10:46.825,01:10:49.703,"Lava, please stop teaching her these big words before she choke on one."
01:10:49.787,01:10:53.123,"No, better I choke you, Lafred."
01:10:53.207,01:10:55.084,"-Look, Jenelope… -You guys, stop!"
01:10:55.167,01:10:57.169,Please. Damn!
01:10:59.922,01:11:02.216,"Well, tell her about the late-night practices we've been having."
01:11:02.299,01:11:05.094,There you go. That's the kind of stuff she wants to hear about.
01:11:05.177,01:11:06.136,Now we're talking.
01:11:22.778,01:11:24.238,You guys have to go to Nationals.
01:11:24.738,01:11:26.407,Did you come up here just to tell me that?
01:11:26.991,01:11:29.118,Here. I got my dad's company to sponsor you guys.
01:11:29.702,01:11:30.995,"What is this, hush money?"
01:11:31.078,01:11:32.121,No.
01:11:32.204,01:11:34.498,"Oh, right. It's guilt money."
01:11:34.581,01:11:40.004,"You pay our way in and you sleep better at night knowing how your whole world is based on one big, old fat lie."
01:11:40.838,01:11:42.923,"Well, you know what?"
01:11:47.678,01:11:48.721,We don't need you.
01:11:48.804,01:11:50.514,Why do you have to be so mean?
01:11:50.597,01:11:52.266,I'm just trying to do the right thing here.
01:11:52.349,01:11:55.352,"Look, I'm trying to be strong for my squad, okay?"
01:11:55.436,01:11:57.104,That's what a captain does.
01:11:57.187,01:12:00.691,"Well, I'm a captain, too, you know, and I'm trying to make it right."
01:12:02.026,01:12:03.819,You wanna make it right?
01:12:04.361,01:12:06.989,"Then when you go to Nationals, bring it."
01:12:07.072,01:12:09.199,Don't slack off because you feel sorry for us.
01:12:10.117,01:12:14.496,"That way, when we beat you, we'll know it's because we're better."
01:12:14.580,01:12:17.166,I'll bring it. Don't worry.
01:12:17.249,01:12:18.751,I never do.
01:12:25.549,01:12:28.344,"Yeah, your parents just have to sign it."
01:12:29.303,01:12:30.346,"Okay, bye."
01:12:30.429,01:12:32.056,"Bye, Tor."
01:12:40.314,01:12:42.858,I listened to your tape. I loved it.
01:12:42.941,01:12:44.068,Great.
01:12:44.151,01:12:45.903,Can I talk to you?
01:12:45.986,01:12:48.530,I was upset that night. Aaron gave me a ride home.
01:12:48.614,01:12:51.283,It was just a good-night kiss. It meant nothing.
01:12:51.367,01:12:53.410,Oh. I'm sorry.
01:12:53.494,01:12:56.747,And I wanted you to know that I broke up with him.
01:12:58.248,01:13:00.042,Congratulations.
01:13:01.543,01:13:03.462,He didn't believe in me.
01:13:03.545,01:13:04.713,You did!
01:13:04.797,01:13:05.672,Whatever.
01:13:05.756,01:13:09.968,That's important to me! You believed in me!
01:13:27.319,01:13:28.237,Bite me.
01:13:28.320,01:13:31.156,"Hanging out with the air heads has really sharpened your verbal skills, huh?"
01:13:31.740,01:13:33.450,Screw you.
01:13:33.534,01:13:35.661,Said the cheerleader.
01:13:35.744,01:13:38.997,"That's right, I am a cheerleader, and you're a dumb ass."
01:13:39.748,01:13:43.001,"Torrance likes you, okay? She likes you."
01:13:43.502,01:13:44.753,She has an odd way of showing it.
01:13:44.837,01:13:46.255,Don't be stupid.
01:13:46.338,01:13:47.881,She broke up with her boyfriend for you.
01:13:47.965,01:13:49.842,Yeah.
01:13:50.342,01:13:54.471,Look. Do us all a favor and get over yourself and tell her how you feel.
01:13:55.389,01:13:57.057,I thought I had.
01:13:57.141,01:13:59.101,"Well, try again."
01:13:59.768,01:14:02.646,And let me give you a little tip from a cheerleader.
01:14:03.313,01:14:06.817,Be aggressive.
01:14:11.238,01:14:13.615,Thank you. Thank you.
01:14:13.699,01:14:16.326,"Today on Pauletta, it's Wish Day!"
01:14:18.287,01:14:21.957,"Today's letter comes from East Compton, California."
01:14:22.040,01:14:31.550,"Dear Pauletta, Where we come from, cheer is not a word that you hear very often, but that's what we are, the cheerleaders of East Compton High School."
01:14:31.633,01:14:36.597,"They should really call us inspiration leaders, because that's what we do."
01:14:36.680,01:14:41.226,We inspire the people from our neighborhoods to believe that our team can win.
01:14:41.310,01:14:48.609,That's why we're asking you to fulfill our wish to send us to the National Cheerleading Competition for the first time.
01:14:48.692,01:14:51.862,"Well, Clovers, you got your wish."
01:14:51.945,01:14:54.781,"Audience, the East Compton Clovers!"
01:14:58.911,01:14:59.995,"Hi, Pauletta."
01:15:00.496,01:15:03.332,We just wanna say how thankful we are for all of your help.
01:15:03.415,01:15:07.294,"Pauletta, you my girl! You the bomb, baby!"
01:15:07.377,01:15:09.296,"Ooh, Pauletta, girl, we love you so much, girl."
01:15:09.379,01:15:10.881,I want to say you don't have to lose a pound.
01:15:10.964,01:15:12.299,We love you just the way you are!
01:15:13.509,01:15:15.552,"Pauletta, we're gonna make you an honorary Clover for life."
01:15:15.636,01:15:16.970,Thank you so much.
01:15:20.432,01:15:23.185,"Ooh! I'm gonna look good in this, y'all."
01:15:33.946,01:15:35.739,"So, is your family coming?"
01:15:35.822,01:15:38.116,I don't know if Cliff's coming.
01:15:38.200,01:15:40.202,I totally blew it with Cliff.
01:15:40.285,01:15:42.246,Forget it. My brother's an idiot.
01:15:42.329,01:15:44.790,You're his sister. You don't see him like I do.
01:15:44.873,01:15:49.002,"Yeah, and that's a good thing, 'cause that would be a crime."
01:15:49.962,01:15:52.339,"Hey, ladies, wanna see my spirit stick?"
01:16:07.187,01:16:08.855,Hello. Hello?
01:16:13.360,01:16:17.114,"Daytona, Florida, has been invaded by teenage cheerleaders."
01:16:17.197,01:16:18.323,And what do they want?
01:16:18.407,01:16:22.035,The chance to be the number one cheerleading squad in the country.
01:16:22.619,01:16:25.747,"You know, in high school, I couldn't pay a cheerleader to talk to me."
01:16:25.831,01:16:33.672,"Now, I'm surrounded by them, and let's face it, any sport that combines gymnastics, dance and short skirts is okay by me."
01:16:33.755,01:16:40.762,"ESPN2 welcomes you to sunny Daytona, Florida, for the Universal Cheer Association Nationals 2000."
01:16:40.846,01:16:46.393,Fifty squads from 50 high schools across the nation are gathered here to duke it out.
01:16:46.476,01:16:49.771,You wanna talk pressure? Ha-ha. These kids are feeling it.
01:16:49.855,01:16:53.817,One individual mistake can cost a squad everything.
01:16:53.900,01:16:59.072,"Who's got spirit? We do, baby. Only on the deuce."
01:17:09.333,01:17:10.834,Hey.
01:17:10.917,01:17:13.670,Watch going out of bounds. They deduct like crazy for that stuff.
01:17:13.754,01:17:15.672,"What, you going for sainthood or something?"
01:17:15.756,01:17:17.049,You don't wanna blow it on something tiny.
01:17:17.132,01:17:20.344,"Look, me and my squad made it to the big show without any of your help."
01:17:20.427,01:17:22.554,I think we can handle it.
01:17:24.139,01:17:25.140,Stay in bounds!
01:17:25.223,01:17:28.685,"If any of you step outside that ugly blue carpet, you are dead."
01:17:28.769,01:17:29.895,Happy?
01:17:29.978,01:17:31.355,Yes.
01:17:31.438,01:17:34.232,Tell your girl on the end she's about a half second early on all her moves.
01:17:34.316,01:17:36.193,"Okay, I will. Happy?"
01:17:36.777,01:17:38.362,Yep.
01:17:38.445,01:17:40.530,"Hey, remember."
01:17:41.740,01:17:43.450,Bring it.
01:17:46.328,01:17:47.996,And what the hell was that about?
01:17:48.080,01:17:53.543,"It's boom, boom… We just understand each other, that's all."
01:17:54.711,01:17:56.421,"All right, let's do this."
01:17:56.505,01:17:58.215,"-One, two, three. -Clovers!"
01:19:29.931,01:19:33.268,and the advancing squads will move on to tomorrow's finals.
01:19:33.351,01:19:38.607,"Defending champs, the Toros, have managed to come back from a humiliating showing at Regionals."
01:19:38.690,01:19:44.613,"But the real Cinderella story here, of course, is the Clovers of East Compton, California."
01:19:46.948,01:19:48.700,Kasey's popping zits again.
01:19:48.784,01:19:51.536,"Gross, Kasey. You're totally bedaubing the mirror."
01:19:51.620,01:19:52.704,Clean it off.
01:19:52.788,01:19:54.956,"Okay, okay! All right."
01:19:58.251,01:20:01.838,"I don't know what's scarier, neurotic cheerleaders or the pressure to win."
01:20:01.922,01:20:05.675,I could make a killing selling something like Diet Prozac.
01:20:06.343,01:20:08.261,"Thank God you're here this season, Missy."
01:20:08.345,01:20:09.846,I couldn't have done it alone.
01:20:09.930,01:20:11.264,Oh! Tear.
01:20:19.439,01:20:22.651,"Shut up! You don't have it yet, you don't have it!"
01:20:22.734,01:20:24.277,Give it up already!
01:20:24.861,01:20:34.496,"Daytona, Florida, day number two By sundown, only one squad can call themselves UCA National Champions 2000."
01:20:37.666,01:20:39.167,Shit!
01:20:40.836,01:20:43.255,Where the hell are my spanky pants?
01:20:43.338,01:20:45.090,What's that on his head?
01:20:45.173,01:20:47.968,"Don't be shy, ladies. Donations are always welcome."
01:20:49.553,01:20:52.430,"Hey, babe. Are you in a giving mood?"
01:20:53.473,01:20:54.432,Sure.
01:20:57.018,01:21:00.313,"Get lost, freak, or I'm gonna tell all your friends that you were at a cheerleading competition."
01:21:00.397,01:21:02.065,You wouldn't.
01:21:02.148,01:21:03.066,"Oh, I would."
01:21:03.942,01:21:06.027,"Hey, I recognize these."
01:21:07.821,01:21:09.239,That was perfect.
01:21:09.322,01:21:13.618,"Your basket toss was amazing, and no one saw that landing."
01:21:14.953,01:21:16.413,Really?
01:21:17.205,01:21:18.456,We should find your tooth.
01:21:21.418,01:21:24.004,"from Colorado Springs, Colorado!"
01:21:24.087,01:21:25.046,Hey.
01:21:26.590,01:21:29.634,That last lift you did was amazing.
01:21:29.718,01:21:31.052,Thanks.
01:21:31.136,01:21:32.721,"Hey, good luck out there."
01:21:32.804,01:21:34.806,"Thanks, man. I'm Les."
01:21:34.890,01:21:36.933,I'm Tim.

01:21:37.934,01:21:39.519,"Hey, I'll see you around?"
01:21:39.603,01:21:41.062,"Yeah, man."
01:21:44.232,01:21:46.693,"Okay, now focus and don't be nervous."
01:21:46.776,01:21:47.777,I'm not nervous.
01:21:48.278,01:21:50.405,"No, just try not to think about the stakes, okay?"
01:21:50.488,01:21:52.657,I'm totally cool. I'm so ready.
01:21:52.741,01:21:56.661,The main thing that you must remember is always smile!
01:22:03.001,01:22:04.419,Sorry.
01:22:05.045,01:22:06.630,"Man, my stomach is killing me!"
01:22:06.713,01:22:09.799,"Yo, relax, girl. You're making me even more nervous."
01:22:09.883,01:22:12.344,"You guys, look. Gather up."
01:22:12.886,01:22:14.054,"Guys, we got this."
01:22:14.137,01:22:17.682,We have done this routine a million times. Just relax.
01:22:17.766,01:22:23.772,"Forget about all those faces out there and just imagine that we're back at our school, in our gym, just doing our thing."
01:22:23.855,01:22:25.148,We'll be fine. All right?
01:22:27.359,01:22:28.485,"All right, now let's do this, Clovers."
01:22:28.568,01:22:29.861,Yeah!

01:32:59.573,01:33:00.783,Ready.
01:33:08.791,01:33:11.585,But it beats the hell out of a shattered skull. Think about it.
01:34:20.279,01:34:22.323,"No, that was shitty. I hated that one."
