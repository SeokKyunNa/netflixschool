00:00:15.166,00:00:17.583,BOY: Listen.
00:00:19.917,00:00:22.041,Can you hear it?
00:00:24.250,00:00:26.166,The music?
00:00:29.333,00:00:33.959,I can hear it everywhere.
00:00:34.000,00:00:35.750,In the wind...
00:00:37.667,00:00:40.083,...in the air...
00:00:40.125,00:00:43.208,in the light.
00:00:49.000,00:00:51.291,It's all around us.
00:01:00.625,00:01:05.125,All you have to do is open yourself up.
00:01:14.834,00:01:17.917,All you have to do...
00:01:17.959,00:01:19.917,is listen.
00:02:09.333,00:02:10.709,"Hello, Porky."
00:02:12.542,00:02:13.959,Where's your little friend?
00:02:14.083,00:02:15.500,"I-I don't know, Mr. Mannix."
00:02:15.542,00:02:17.291,"Okay, well go find him, or your big butt's mine."
00:02:17.333,00:02:19.625,BOY: Where I've grown up...
00:02:19.667,00:02:21.500,Evan!
00:02:22.458,00:02:24.417,Evan!
00:02:24.458,00:02:28.834,...they try to stop me from hearing the music.
00:02:31.500,00:02:35.083,But when I'm alone...
00:02:35.083,00:02:38.625,it builds up from inside me.
00:02:38.667,00:02:43.333,And I think if I could learn how to play it...
00:02:46.542,00:02:49.250,...they might hear me.
00:02:52.083,00:02:55.458,They would know I was theirs...
00:02:55.500,00:02:57.542,and find me.
00:02:58.667,00:03:01.500,Knock-knock.
00:03:01.542,00:03:04.291,Knock-knock.
00:03:04.333,00:03:07.125,Wake up.
00:03:07.166,00:03:09.375,Freak.
00:03:09.417,00:03:12.583,Freak.
00:03:12.625,00:03:15.083,"I said, knock-knock, freak."
00:03:15.083,00:03:16.083,Who's there?
00:03:16.125,00:03:19.083,Your long lost mommy and daddy.
00:03:19.125,00:03:21.542,Can you hear them?
00:03:21.583,00:03:24.500,Yes.
00:03:29.083,00:03:31.208,"No, you can't."
00:03:31.250,00:03:33.583,I can.
00:03:37.458,00:03:40.917,You don't have no family.
00:03:40.959,00:03:44.125,You can't hear anything.
00:03:44.166,00:03:45.792,Say it.
00:03:47.500,00:03:49.417,Say it.
00:03:49.458,00:03:51.667,Say it!
00:03:51.709,00:03:55.166,Say it! Say it!
00:03:55.208,00:03:57.250,Yes...
00:03:57.291,00:03:59.083,I can.
00:04:00.208,00:04:03.250,He doesn't hear anything.
00:04:03.291,00:04:04.625,Yeah.
00:04:06.125,00:04:07.917,What is he?
00:04:07.959,00:04:11.333,He's a freak.
00:04:13.542,00:04:16.709,"Sweet dreams, freaks."
00:04:24.417,00:04:27.875,EVAN: Sometimes the world tries to knock it out of you.
00:04:32.291,00:04:37.083,But I believe in music the way that some people believe in fairy tales.
00:04:48.542,00:04:54.792,I like to imagine that what I hear came from my mother and father.
00:05:13.083,00:05:16.667,EVAN: Maybe the notes I hear are the same ones they heard...
00:05:16.709,00:05:21.458,the night they met.
00:05:21.500,00:05:23.834,Maybe that's how they found each other.
00:05:26.542,00:05:30.166,Maybe that's how they'll find me.
00:05:30.208,00:05:32.291,Louis?
00:05:32.333,00:05:34.458,"Louie, where are you?"
00:05:34.500,00:05:36.333,Lyla? She's here.
00:05:36.375,00:05:37.333,What are you doing?
00:05:37.375,00:05:38.500,They're waiting for us.
00:05:38.542,00:05:40.458,"Hey, sit up straight, please."
00:05:40.500,00:05:41.875,"Where are you, baby bro?"
00:05:41.917,00:05:46.583,"We didn't follow you from San Francisco to play for free, man, yeah?"
00:05:46.625,00:05:48.500,"We need this one, baby bro, all right?"
00:05:48.542,00:05:50.083,I need this one.
00:05:50.125,00:05:52.500,"Don't forget to smile, and look relaxed."
00:05:54.125,00:05:55.166,"All right, not that relaxed."
00:05:55.208,00:05:56.583,"Come on, come on."
00:05:58.834,00:06:04.583,"EVAN: I believe that once upon a time, long ago..."
00:06:04.625,00:06:06.667,they heard the music...
00:06:06.709,00:06:09.917,and followed it.
00:09:01.166,00:09:03.542,"Not bad, Connelly."
00:09:03.583,00:09:05.417,Not bad.
00:09:05.458,00:09:07.125,Where's the main man?
00:09:07.166,00:09:10.291,"Goddamn it, Louis."
00:09:10.333,00:09:12.542,Louis!
00:09:12.583,00:09:14.834,"Louis, wait up, man."
00:09:18.250,00:09:19.709,"So, girls..."
00:09:19.750,00:09:22.083,we are going to a party tonight.
00:09:22.083,00:09:24.542,"It's a full moon, you know what that means, right?"
00:09:36.417,00:09:38.834,Lyla!
00:10:21.208,00:10:23.875,"It's a great sound, isn't it?"
00:10:25.834,00:10:28.542,What are you doing?
00:10:28.583,00:10:30.375,Listening.
00:10:31.959,00:10:34.417,What are you doing?
00:10:36.834,00:10:40.291,"I... I just came up here to, um..."
00:10:40.333,00:10:41.750,Get away?
00:10:45.333,00:10:48.375,Have a seat.
00:10:48.417,00:10:50.250,Come on.
00:10:50.291,00:10:51.667,Be brave.
00:10:51.709,00:10:54.792,Front row center.
00:11:19.083,00:11:21.166,Can you hear that?
00:11:21.208,00:11:23.583,What is that?
00:11:23.625,00:11:25.917,It's a wish.
00:11:34.625,00:11:36.875,And what does that sound like?
00:11:57.083,00:12:02.917,"When I was a young fella, I used to talk to the moon."
00:12:02.959,00:12:05.875,Are you making that up?
00:12:07.792,00:12:10.250,"God, I haven't done that in a long time."
00:12:12.709,00:12:15.917,Does it ever talk back?
00:12:15.959,00:12:20.417,"Well, he used to."
00:12:20.458,00:12:24.750,Now I just find myself on a roof talking to myself.
00:12:24.792,00:12:28.583,Like a loon.
00:12:28.625,00:12:31.583,Just...
00:12:31.625,00:12:34.500,out here on my own.
00:12:34.542,00:12:39.375,"Well, I'm here."
00:12:39.417,00:12:43.291,"Yes, you are."
00:12:51.458,00:12:53.125,I'm Louis.
00:12:55.583,00:12:57.625,Lyla.
00:12:57.667,00:12:59.875,"So what's your story, Lyla?"
00:12:59.917,00:13:04.917,I don't know.
00:13:07.500,00:13:09.500,I'm just me.
00:13:16.625,00:13:19.125,What are you looking at?
00:13:19.166,00:13:22.083,You.
00:14:17.083,00:14:19.250,MAN: Next.
00:14:20.583,00:14:23.166,What did he want?
00:14:23.208,00:14:26.083,You know-- same old junk.
00:14:26.083,00:14:28.667,MAN: My name is Mr. Jefferies.
00:14:28.709,00:14:33.750,I'm with Child Services for the State of New York.
00:14:33.792,00:14:35.792,"Okay, Evan..."
00:14:35.834,00:14:42.625,"Born December 17, 1995..."
00:14:39.208,00:14:45.375,legal adoption to New York Children's...
00:14:48.625,00:14:50.625,"How long have you been here, Evan?"
00:14:50.667,00:14:53.083,Eleven years and 16 days.
00:14:54.625,00:14:56.542,I've been counting.
00:14:56.583,00:14:59.458,That's a long time.
00:14:59.500,00:15:01.333,How do you do that?
00:15:01.375,00:15:02.959,Do what?
00:15:08.208,00:15:10.417,Just imitating the wind chime.
00:15:22.333,00:15:26.625,You don't want to be placed with a real family?
00:15:26.667,00:15:28.375,I have a family.
00:15:28.417,00:15:29.959,"Yes, you do."
00:15:30.083,00:15:33.583,"I mean, you have parents and all, but they don't live with you."
00:15:33.625,00:15:34.834,Now.
00:15:34.875,00:15:36.250,"But, still, you..."
00:15:36.291,00:15:39.083,you don't have contact with them.
00:15:39.125,00:15:40.792,"Yes, I do."
00:15:40.834,00:15:42.458,You do?
00:15:45.750,00:15:48.208,What? Do they call you?
00:15:50.083,00:15:51.750,Come and visit you?
00:15:51.792,00:15:53.542,I-I...
00:15:54.959,00:15:58.542,I don't want to be sent away.
00:16:01.542,00:16:03.542,I understand.
00:16:03.583,00:16:07.959,"You see, there's a lot of children who..."
00:16:08.083,00:16:13.458,are scared that if they leave their first home their parents would never be able to find them.
00:16:13.500,00:16:15.542,Right?
00:16:15.583,00:16:21.917,"You see, my job is to make sure that nothing like that will ever happen to you."
00:16:21.959,00:16:24.166,So there's nothing to be scared of.
00:16:26.875,00:16:29.250,Thank you.
00:16:33.542,00:16:37.625,I'm going to do something I never do.
00:16:37.667,00:16:40.917,This is my number.
00:16:40.959,00:16:46.750,"If you ever need to talk to me, about anything..."
00:16:46.792,00:16:48.834,you call.
00:16:48.875,00:16:50.834,"Think about what I said, too."
00:16:50.875,00:16:55.667,There's a whole world out there with millions of wind chimes.
00:16:55.709,00:16:57.625,I know.
00:17:05.125,00:17:06.667,You can go now.
00:17:16.792,00:17:20.083,PORKY: Mannix says we're never going to see our real parents again.
00:17:20.083,00:17:22.375,Mannix is a big liar.
00:17:22.417,00:17:26.083,"Yeah, I know, but..."
00:17:26.083,00:17:28.375,I mean...
00:17:26.083,00:17:32.917,"if they don't ever come, I probably won't even remember what my mom looks like, you know?"
00:17:32.959,00:17:39.083,"Well, if they don't find us, we'll just have to go find them."
00:18:19.792,00:18:20.792,Morning.
00:18:20.834,00:18:22.125,"LYLA: Oh, my God..."
00:18:24.333,00:18:25.709,I have to go.
00:18:25.750,00:18:27.083,Let me walk you home.
00:18:27.083,00:18:28.291,No!
00:18:28.333,00:18:30.458,My dad's waiting at the Sherry. I...
00:18:30.500,00:18:32.291,I've never done this before.
00:18:32.333,00:18:34.208,I'm in so much trouble.
00:18:34.250,00:18:35.458,"Hey, hey..."
00:18:35.500,00:18:38.083,"Meet me here at 10:00, by the arch."
00:18:38.125,00:18:41.333,Say it.
00:18:41.375,00:18:43.917,Say it...
00:18:43.959,00:18:45.834,Say it.
00:18:50.917,00:18:53.458,I take that as a yes!
00:18:57.625,00:18:59.667,LIZ: You are gonna be in so much trouble!
00:18:59.709,00:19:01.709,You should have at least left your dad a note.
00:19:01.750,00:19:03.083,"Yeah, a ransom note."
00:19:03.083,00:19:04.542,You know what?
00:19:04.583,00:19:07.625,I just had the most incredible night of my life.
00:19:07.667,00:19:09.625,Taxi!
00:19:16.083,00:19:17.959,"MARSHALL: Louis, she ain't comin'."
00:19:18.083,00:19:23.250,"Aw, man..."
00:19:23.291,00:19:25.583,"Come on, we're gonna miss the flight!"
00:19:27.834,00:19:29.458,Taxi!
00:19:29.500,00:19:31.750,"MARSHALL: Hey, Louis!"
00:19:33.291,00:19:35.709,Excuse me.
00:19:36.834,00:19:37.834,MARSHALL: Louie!
00:19:39.625,00:19:41.500,FATHER: You are not going anywhere!
00:19:41.542,00:19:43.166,Lyla!
00:19:43.208,00:19:44.792,"Dad, I'm not going with you."
00:19:44.834,00:19:46.375,Lyla! You listen to me.
00:19:46.417,00:19:48.625,No...!
00:19:48.667,00:19:49.834,I'm not going with you!
00:19:57.417,00:20:00.750,LOUIS: Lyla!
00:20:04.083,00:20:08.000,Get in the car right now!
00:20:10.917,00:20:13.583,Lyla! Lyla!
00:20:26.125,00:20:28.333,MARSHALL: Louis!
00:20:31.125,00:20:33.667,"Do you remember what Da used to say about princesses, huh?"
00:20:33.709,00:20:36.125,They're always looking for their prince...
00:20:36.166,00:20:38.458,"and you ain't no prince, brother."
00:20:38.500,00:20:41.000,How would you know?
00:20:41.834,00:20:43.917,LOUIS: What am I gonna do now?
00:20:57.208,00:21:00.083,EVAN: I know they're out there somewhere.
00:21:13.959,00:21:16.875,I don't know where it comes from...
00:21:19.500,00:21:22.458,...but it's what I hold onto...
00:21:27.083,00:21:28.875,...and I can't let go.
00:21:33.291,00:21:38.458,"Somewhere inside me, I know that they always wanted me."
00:21:41.125,00:21:43.667,Maybe they just got lost.
00:21:44.834,00:22:52.542,"LOUIS: LOUIS: What's the point in singing, Marshall?"
00:22:53.709,00:22:55.333,She's not gonna hear me.
00:22:55.375,00:22:57.291,I'm leaving the band.
00:22:57.333,00:22:59.083,"I'm sorry, Marshall."
00:22:59.125,00:23:01.917,"MARSHALL: Don't quit on us, Louis."
00:23:06.417,00:23:09.709,"MARSHALL: Everything we've given up, everything I've given up."
00:23:11.208,00:23:12.458,I can't do it.
00:23:12.500,00:23:14.083,"I'm sorry, Frank, I can't do it, man."
00:23:14.083,00:23:16.083,"Louie, listen to me, listen to me..."
00:23:16.083,00:23:18.458,"You know what I mean, Lyla?"
00:23:18.500,00:23:21.083,to approach this problem-- I mean...
00:23:21.083,00:23:22.375,Where are you going to put the baby?
00:23:22.417,00:23:23.625,And what about this boy?
00:23:23.667,00:23:25.583,He's not here now.
00:23:25.625,00:23:26.959,I'm leaving!
00:23:27.083,00:23:28.875,"Where are you going then, Louis, huh?"
00:23:28.917,00:23:30.709,"Let me go, man!"
00:23:37.875,00:23:39.083,Louis...
00:23:39.083,00:23:41.792,Lyla!
00:23:43.792,00:23:44.750,Louis.
00:23:44.792,00:23:47.834,Lyla!
00:24:09.667,00:24:12.083,We have fetal distress.
00:24:14.500,00:24:15.792,The baby's heart rate is falling.
00:24:18.500,00:24:20.834,It's falling.
00:24:48.417,00:24:51.709,I'm sorry.
00:24:55.291,00:24:58.166,He's gone.
00:26:00.250,00:26:04.834,"MAN: Picked him up on the throughway outside of Montrose, just wandering down the road."
00:26:04.875,00:26:06.834,"Said he's, uh, following the music."
00:26:06.875,00:26:08.458,The moon told him to.
00:26:08.500,00:26:09.834,"Yeah, kid's a space cadet."
00:26:15.625,00:26:18.458,"Look, I got a busy day ahead of me."
00:26:18.500,00:26:21.250,"All right, big guy, out you go."
00:26:21.291,00:26:25.917,"This Jeffries guy wasn't in his office yet, so I left him a message to pick you up right here when he does."
00:26:25.959,00:26:27.375,Okay.
00:26:27.417,00:26:29.542,"Now, don't lose it."
00:26:29.583,00:26:32.125,"If he doesn't show in an hour or so, give him another call."
00:26:32.166,00:26:33.417,"You can handle that, right?"
00:26:33.458,00:26:35.458,Got any money?
00:26:35.500,00:26:36.750,Here's 12 bucks.
00:26:36.792,00:26:39.625,"Damn, kid, put it in your pocket."
00:26:39.667,00:26:41.208,See ya.
00:28:41.542,00:28:43.500,DRIVER: Get on the sidewalk!
00:29:46.625,00:29:48.500,"Okay, citizen..."
00:29:48.542,00:29:49.667,you paid-- any requests?
00:29:49.709,00:29:51.291,No.
00:29:53.417,00:29:55.166,Alrighty then.
00:30:27.500,00:30:28.458,"Whoa, whoa! Back off!"
00:30:28.500,00:30:30.125,Away! Away!
00:30:30.166,00:30:32.291,"Yo, son, you messin' with my equilibrium."
00:30:32.333,00:30:33.834,Nobody touches this instrument but me.
00:30:33.875,00:30:35.166,Roxie's my girl.
00:30:35.208,00:30:36.500,"Son, why you down here?"
00:30:36.542,00:30:38.667,"Why don't you go find your mommy, a'ight?"
00:30:38.709,00:30:39.709,I don't know where she is.
00:30:39.750,00:30:41.208,Good.
00:30:41.250,00:30:43.375,Uh... cops show up around 6:00.
00:30:43.417,00:30:45.125,They'll send you back where you come from.
00:30:45.166,00:30:47.709,I don't want to go back there.
00:30:47.750,00:30:49.834,"Well, good."
00:30:49.875,00:30:51.500,"State's been a bust, anyway."
00:30:51.542,00:30:52.875,I'm out.
00:31:13.667,00:31:15.417,What?!
00:31:17.125,00:31:19.166,I don't have a place to stay.
00:31:19.208,00:31:22.667,Do I look like a real estate tycoon to you?
00:31:25.875,00:31:27.875,How many dead presidents you got?
00:31:27.917,00:31:30.792,Nuggets? Shorts?
00:31:30.834,00:31:32.542,Show me the money.
00:31:37.208,00:31:38.458,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
00:31:38.500,00:31:41.542,"No, I'm thinking something else."
00:31:43.083,00:31:46.125,I'm gonna let you buy me a pizza.
00:32:00.083,00:32:02.750,"LOUIS: I've been doing this for ten years, bub."
00:32:02.792,00:32:06.250,I said ten percent.
00:32:06.291,00:32:09.083,But it's close to-- hold on a second.
00:32:09.125,00:32:11.750,No... we said ten percent.
00:32:11.792,00:32:15.250,"Yeah, well, it makes the world go round, doesn't it, Paul?"
00:32:16.375,00:32:19.250,"Just get me the ten percent, will ya?"
00:32:19.291,00:32:21.083,Thanks.
00:32:22.083,00:32:24.667,"Oh, gee..."
00:32:24.709,00:32:25.959,"Need anything, sir?"
00:32:26.083,00:32:27.458,Do you know any hit men?
00:32:27.500,00:32:30.291,I do know a bass player might be able to help you out.
00:32:30.333,00:32:33.333,Likes to get in fights with lead singers.
00:32:35.375,00:32:36.542,Nick?!
00:32:37.834,00:32:40.375,"What are you doing, man?"
00:32:42.083,00:32:44.500,"Still driving, paying off those wedding bills from last year."
00:32:44.542,00:32:45.875,"Oh, fair play to you."
00:32:45.917,00:32:47.208,"Oh, she's a nice girl."
00:32:47.250,00:32:50.500,So you playing at all?
00:32:50.542,00:32:52.083,Nope.
00:32:52.083,00:32:54.667,Why the hell not?
00:32:54.709,00:32:58.083,"Ah, you move on."
00:32:59.500,00:33:02.834,What about the lads?
00:33:02.875,00:33:09.959,"Ah, we still mess around, but the Connelly Brothers never really bounced back, minus one brother."
00:33:13.875,00:33:16.083,You seen Marshall lately?
00:33:16.083,00:33:18.583,Have you?
00:33:21.250,00:33:23.166,It's my birthday on Saturday.
00:33:23.208,00:33:25.375,Session's at my place.
00:33:25.417,00:33:27.083,"Come, bring a girlfriend."
00:33:27.875,00:33:29.375,"It's great seeing you, man."
00:33:29.417,00:33:31.375,Reminds me of New York.
00:33:31.417,00:33:33.375,"The good ol' days, eh?"
00:33:42.875,00:33:46.542,I know... I know...
00:33:46.583,00:33:49.375,I know...
00:33:49.417,00:33:52.166,"Oh! Fur Elise, by Beethoven."
00:33:52.208,00:33:53.959,And you should know that one.
00:33:54.083,00:33:55.917,"Oh, yeah!"
00:33:55.959,00:33:59.208,"Will you be our teacher forever, Miss Novacek?"
00:33:59.250,00:34:02.166,"Well, at least until your old teacher comes back."
00:34:02.208,00:34:05.583,But only if you call me...
00:34:05.625,00:34:06.750,Lyla!

00:34:09.917,00:34:11.083,WOMAN: Megan!
00:34:12.166,00:34:13.834,Okay.

00:34:16.834,00:34:18.417,"Hi, sweetie."
00:34:19.834,00:34:21.709,WOMAN: Did you have a good day?
00:34:23.166,00:34:25.333,Thanks!
00:34:25.375,00:34:26.583,There you are.
00:34:26.625,00:34:32.625,"Now, before you say no-- okay, picture this: You, on stage."
00:34:32.667,00:34:33.792,Thousands of people.
00:34:33.834,00:34:35.166,Liz...

00:34:37.250,00:34:39.291,They want you back.
00:34:39.333,00:34:41.667,"It's just one night, but they want you back."
00:34:43.625,00:34:45.917,I-I don't want to be up there.
00:34:45.959,00:34:48.375,Lyla...
00:34:48.417,00:34:50.417,when are you gonna let yourself be happy again?
00:34:50.458,00:34:53.583,I am happy.
00:34:53.625,00:34:57.542,I'm talking about when everyone else goes home.
00:35:04.208,00:35:08.166,"Look... I know, okay?"
00:35:10.083,00:35:11.625,Just think about it.
00:35:11.667,00:35:16.792,"I mean, you're a music teacher who doesn't play music anymore."
00:35:16.834,00:35:18.709,Call me crazy.
00:35:18.750,00:35:21.667,"Okay, crazy, I'll see you at home, okay?"
00:35:21.709,00:35:23.709,All right.
00:35:33.667,00:35:35.834,"ARTHUR: Nah, I ain't got no daddy."
00:35:37.542,00:35:43.208,"See, my pops is a drunk, and my mama, she took off with this crackhead named Lil' Jesus."
00:35:43.250,00:35:47.125,"But, you know, he wasn't no Lil' Jesus, you know what I'm sayin'?"
00:35:47.166,00:35:48.625,"No, he never gave a damn about me."
00:35:50.834,00:35:52.208,"Come on, man!"
00:35:52.250,00:35:56.625,This is us right here.
00:35:56.667,00:35:58.834,I been with Wizard for years.
00:35:58.875,00:36:00.166,Who's Wizard?
00:36:00.208,00:36:02.333,"Oh, he's a real piece of work, that's what he is."
00:36:02.375,00:36:05.291,His real name is Maxwell Wallace.
00:36:05.333,00:36:06.500,He took me in.
00:36:06.542,00:36:08.375,He said that I was an investment.
00:36:08.417,00:36:10.083,He gave me Roxie here.
00:36:10.083,00:36:11.500,He bought it in the old days.
00:36:11.542,00:36:13.333,"Well, he didn't really buy it."
00:36:13.375,00:36:15.375,Guess you'd kind of say he found it.
00:36:15.417,00:36:16.792,"A'ight, he stole it."
00:36:16.834,00:36:19.250,"Wizard, he gave me his place at the square."
00:36:19.291,00:36:22.208,"My parents, they ain't give me nothing."
00:36:24.166,00:36:27.709,We all gonna be big stars someday.
00:36:27.750,00:36:29.583,What's the tap order?
00:36:29.625,00:36:31.625,Open the damn door already!
00:36:32.750,00:36:34.458,"Hey, you're getting on my nerves with that, son."
00:36:38.083,00:36:40.959,"ARTHUR: Okay, follow me."
00:36:44.166,00:36:45.750,What's your name again?
00:36:45.792,00:36:48.458,"It's Evan, right?"
00:36:48.500,00:36:50.542,"ARTHUR: Yo, this is our home, so..."
00:36:50.583,00:36:53.333,"It's kind of crazy in here, so stay on your feet."
00:36:57.750,00:36:59.875,"Yeah, I've been living here for a while."
00:37:00.083,00:37:01.333,"Come on, man."
00:37:03.625,00:37:05.083,"Son, how money did you make today?"
00:37:05.083,00:37:06.875,I made ten dollars.
00:37:06.917,00:37:08.417,I am not lying.
00:37:11.500,00:37:13.500,Hey! I'll be laughing at your funeral.
00:37:13.542,00:37:15.417,I'm gonna go play basketball.
00:37:15.458,00:37:16.667,"Hey, all clear!"
00:37:22.500,00:37:26.458,"You should have knocked him in his head, son."
00:37:35.375,00:37:37.542,KID: Shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot it!
00:37:37.583,00:37:38.792,Oh!
00:37:38.834,00:37:40.709,Sweet!
00:37:42.959,00:37:45.083,Pizza!
00:37:49.792,00:37:52.417,Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!
00:38:06.500,00:38:07.959,Don't make me come up there.
00:38:08.083,00:38:10.542,"BOY: Yo, you'd better hurry before Wizard shows."
00:38:10.583,00:38:13.083,He'll be pissed if he seen you bought a pie.
00:38:13.083,00:38:15.458,I didn't take no family money.
00:38:15.500,00:38:17.375,Citizen bought it.
00:38:18.417,00:38:21.333,"Hola, music lovers!"
00:38:22.458,00:38:24.625,"Ah, while the cat's away..."
00:38:24.667,00:38:26.291,Oh...!
00:38:26.333,00:38:28.333,Who likes pizza?
00:38:30.208,00:38:31.750,Who did this?!
00:38:33.125,00:38:35.542,Arthur.
00:38:40.208,00:38:41.458,What is he?
00:38:41.500,00:38:42.542,He's a damn fool!
00:38:42.583,00:38:44.166,He's a damn fool.
00:38:45.333,00:38:46.375,He's gonna get it good.
00:38:46.417,00:38:49.333,"Shh. What are you, Arthur?"
00:38:49.375,00:38:51.667,"I'm a real piece of work, Wizard."
00:38:52.625,00:38:54.709,You're on thin ice.
00:38:54.750,00:38:57.125,I didn't take no family money.
00:38:57.166,00:38:59.208,He bought it.
00:39:04.083,00:39:06.083,What?
00:39:06.125,00:39:07.834,You look crazy.
00:39:08.959,00:39:10.417,I am crazy.
00:39:12.583,00:39:15.208,See?

00:39:20.083,00:39:22.375,Now!
00:39:22.417,00:39:24.583,Come on.
00:39:26.500,00:39:28.792,What's your name?
00:39:28.834,00:39:30.542,"Evan, sir."
00:39:30.583,00:39:32.583,What are you doing here?
00:39:32.625,00:39:35.500,I followed the music.
00:39:40.500,00:39:44.125,"Where'd you pick this one up, Arthur, Bellevue?"
00:39:47.667,00:39:49.834,You never played a note in your life.
00:39:50.542,00:39:52.875,Do you know what music is?
00:39:54.083,00:39:58.500,It's God's little reminder there's something else besides us in this universe.
00:39:58.542,00:40:04.667,"Harmonic connection between all living beings everywhere, even the stars."
00:40:04.709,00:40:07.375,Is this a school?
00:40:07.417,00:40:10.709,"ARTHUR: Yeah, the School of Screw You and Take All Your Damn Money."
00:40:10.750,00:40:12.959,"Yeah, we're top of the class."
00:40:16.583,00:40:18.458,It's a business.
00:40:20.625,00:40:21.959,Pockets!
00:40:22.000,00:40:24.458,Pockets!
00:40:25.333,00:40:27.291,"BOY: Oh, man, shut up!"
00:40:31.125,00:40:32.583,"Nina, well done."
00:40:32.625,00:40:35.500,I got eyes in the back of my head.
00:40:35.542,00:40:37.083,Good job.
00:40:37.125,00:40:38.417,Gracias amiga.
00:40:38.458,00:40:42.750,Chain is only as strong...
00:40:44.291,00:40:46.709,"Come on, Arthur."
00:40:46.750,00:40:48.667,It's chump change.
00:40:48.709,00:40:49.959,You got Washington Square.
00:40:50.000,00:40:52.500,That was my spot for ten years.
00:40:55.667,00:40:57.625,Go ahead.
00:40:57.667,00:41:00.667,I changed my mind.
00:41:03.375,00:41:06.542,You kids are going to put me in the poorhouse.
00:41:06.583,00:41:08.417,"All right, little mice, scurry back to your holes."
00:41:08.458,00:41:09.959,"Go, go!"
00:41:12.333,00:41:15.500,"Harmonic dreams, sweet children."
00:43:44.083,00:43:45.750,ARTHUR: Roxanne!
00:43:45.792,00:43:47.750,Now I'm gonna kill him!
00:44:15.583,00:44:17.750,WIZARD: You know what's out there?
00:44:17.792,00:44:20.583,A series of higher tones.
00:44:20.625,00:44:22.166,It's arranged by nature.
00:44:22.208,00:44:26.500,It's governed by the laws of physics of the whole universe.
00:44:26.542,00:44:30.250,"It's an overtone, it's an energy, it's a wavelength."
00:44:30.291,00:44:34.834,"And if you're not riding it, good Lordy, you'll never hear it."
00:44:34.875,00:44:38.500,Where do you think it comes from?
00:44:38.542,00:44:40.166,What I hear.
00:44:40.208,00:44:42.333,I think it comes from all around you really.
00:44:42.375,00:44:46.458,"I mean, it... comes through us, some of us."
00:44:48.542,00:44:51.667,"It's invisible, but you feel it."
00:44:51.709,00:44:54.250,So only some of us can hear it?
00:44:54.291,00:44:58.125,Only some of us are listening.
00:45:00.083,00:45:03.375,Do you think my parents are listening?
00:45:03.417,00:45:06.750,"I hear you, kid."
00:45:08.583,00:45:09.875,Like...
00:45:11.709,00:45:13.875,Yeah.
00:45:16.917,00:45:18.917,JENNY: Are you hearing a word I'm saying?
00:45:23.417,00:45:25.500,Louis!
00:45:25.542,00:45:26.667,Come on.
00:45:26.709,00:45:28.542,It's about time I met your family.
00:45:31.917,00:45:34.166,"Listen, Jenn."
00:45:34.208,00:45:36.625,Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
00:45:36.667,00:45:38.625,Grow up.
00:45:38.667,00:45:41.583,Come on.
00:45:41.625,00:45:43.709,JENNY: Hon!
00:45:47.333,00:45:50.583,JENNY: Are all Irish people this loud?
00:45:50.625,00:45:51.792,Yeah.
00:46:24.166,00:46:26.750,"NICK: Marshall, your brother's here."
00:46:26.792,00:46:28.125,Louis.
00:46:30.458,00:46:32.250,"Hey, Nick."
00:46:34.458,00:46:36.625,"JENNY: Oh, my God."
00:46:36.667,00:46:39.458,Is that you?
00:46:40.834,00:46:44.333,When were you going to tell me you're in a band?
00:46:45.333,00:46:49.959,"MARSHALL: I'm sure there's a lot of things our Louis hasn't told you, darling."
00:46:50.083,00:46:51.417,Like who'd you write the song for?
00:46:51.458,00:46:53.083,I told you this was a mistake.
00:46:53.125,00:46:54.917,"MARSHALL: That's it, go on."
00:46:54.959,00:46:57.417,Walk out on us again.
00:46:59.250,00:47:00.542,"Hey, Lou."
00:47:00.583,00:47:01.959,"Say what you got to say, Marshall-- come on."
00:47:02.083,00:47:03.709,Say what you have to say.
00:47:03.750,00:47:04.834,"Come on, say it."
00:47:04.875,00:47:06.166,Come on!
00:47:06.208,00:47:07.792,"Come on, say it, say it."
00:47:07.834,00:47:10.125,"Come on, hit me."
00:47:10.166,00:47:12.583,That's it.
00:47:13.750,00:47:15.792,I'm suffocating here.
00:47:21.834,00:47:23.333,"You all right, man?"
00:47:25.500,00:47:27.166,"You all right, man?"
00:47:27.208,00:47:29.625,Welcome to the Connelly clan.
00:47:36.375,00:47:38.458,Jennifer.
00:48:03.750,00:48:07.458,"You know, it was good having the old Louis back in there."
00:48:07.500,00:48:10.375,Even if it was only for a second.
00:48:11.417,00:48:12.959,Louie.
00:48:13.083,00:48:18.583,Aren't you supposed to be in the car with the girl as she drives off into the sunset?
00:48:27.125,00:48:30.291,"You'll get your suit dirty sitting there, man."
00:48:44.542,00:48:46.542,This is a message for Lyla Novacek.
00:48:46.583,00:48:48.500,Please call Good Samaritan Hospital.
00:48:48.542,00:48:51.583,"I'm calling you about your father, Thomas Novacek."
00:49:01.583,00:49:04.458,I wasn't sure you were going to come.
00:49:04.500,00:49:08.083,My will is in the top drawer of the desk in my study.
00:49:08.083,00:49:10.542,"Dad, stop. Come on."
00:49:10.583,00:49:13.083,"Lyla, please."
00:49:13.125,00:49:15.458,There's more.
00:49:21.083,00:49:27.625,"All I ever wanted was for you to have that promise, all that life."
00:49:27.667,00:49:29.959,You were so young.
00:49:30.083,00:49:32.125,We had so much work to do.
00:49:32.166,00:49:33.291,You weren't ready.
00:49:33.333,00:49:36.458,"It's fine, Dad, really."
00:49:36.500,00:49:41.125,"I mean, the baby, that baby, he could have hurt you."
00:49:43.667,00:49:45.333,"He could have hurt you, and I..."
00:49:45.375,00:49:48.625,"I wasn't going to let that happen, Lyla."
00:49:53.208,00:49:56.083,I made a choice for us.
00:49:59.583,00:50:01.709,"Oh, my God."
00:50:02.542,00:50:05.041,THOMAS: A choice for us.
00:50:06.875,00:50:10.458,Wait.
00:50:13.291,00:50:16.208,THOMAS: I'm sorry.
00:50:19.041,00:50:21.500,Where?
00:50:23.875,00:50:26.500,Where is he?
00:50:26.542,00:50:28.250,I didn't mean...
00:50:28.291,00:50:30.709,Where is he?!
00:50:30.750,00:50:33.417,I don't know.
00:50:33.458,00:50:37.500,I don't.
00:50:44.709,00:50:47.709,WIZARD: You got to love music more than you love food.
00:50:47.750,00:50:50.125,More than life.
00:50:50.166,00:50:52.458,More than yourself.
00:50:58.625,00:51:00.125,You feel it?
00:51:02.792,00:51:04.500,Then show me.
00:51:04.542,00:51:06.250,Play it for your parents.
00:51:56.792,00:51:58.333,My dear.
00:52:03.166,00:52:05.166,Whoo!
00:52:07.667,00:52:09.959,WIZARD: Yeah!
00:52:10.083,00:52:11.917,You know what I'm thinking?
00:52:13.166,00:52:15.792,"You're supposed to say, What are you thinking, Wizard?"
00:52:15.834,00:52:18.125,"What are you thinking, Wizard?"
00:52:18.166,00:52:20.458,I'll teach you everything I know for free.
00:52:20.500,00:52:25.875,"You get Roxanne, you get my corner of the park, you get to keep half your tips."
00:52:25.917,00:52:28.792,We're like a team.
00:52:28.834,00:52:31.083,There's something wrong with that picture.
00:52:31.125,00:52:32.458,What?
00:52:32.500,00:52:36.834,I don't think performing in parks and street corners is going to be enough.
00:52:36.875,00:52:38.166,It won't?
00:52:38.208,00:52:40.667,No.
00:52:40.709,00:52:42.166,Evan.
00:52:42.208,00:52:44.583,We need to get you a new name.
00:52:44.625,00:52:46.500,Something with a little more pop.
00:52:46.542,00:52:48.375,What do you want to be in the world?
00:52:48.417,00:52:50.542,"I mean, the whole world-- what do you want to be?"
00:52:50.583,00:52:53.625,Close your eyes and think about that.
00:52:55.083,00:52:57.375,Found.
00:53:01.291,00:53:03.250,Doesn't have enough yin.
00:53:04.375,00:53:05.917,"Little more yang, you know?"
00:53:05.959,00:53:08.542,"Yeah, let's..."
00:53:08.583,00:53:11.375,Talk about wishful thinking.
00:53:11.417,00:53:13.500,Look at that.
00:53:15.166,00:53:16.375,Whoa.
00:53:16.417,00:53:18.291,"What name stands out to you on that, huh?"
00:53:18.333,00:53:19.709,Beach?
00:53:19.750,00:53:22.542,It's a good name for a band but not for a performer.
00:53:22.583,00:53:24.166,"You can't say, Please welcome Beach."
00:53:24.208,00:53:25.834,No. No.
00:53:25.875,00:53:27.166,August Rush!
00:53:27.208,00:53:28.458,August Rush.
00:53:28.500,00:53:29.959,Doesn't that warm you up a little bit?
00:53:30.083,00:53:31.417,I can see it.
00:53:31.458,00:53:36.834,Wizard Productions presents...
00:53:31.458,00:53:40.333,"the number-one heat wave, August Rush!"
00:53:41.917,00:53:43.166,Me!
00:53:43.208,00:53:44.500,"Yes! August, August, August!"
00:53:44.542,00:53:45.834,That gives me a rush.
00:53:45.875,00:53:47.542,"That gives me chills, man!"
00:53:47.583,00:53:49.375,Got my hairs on the back of my neck standing up.
00:53:49.417,00:53:50.458,Really?
00:53:50.500,00:53:51.875,Look at that.
00:53:51.917,00:53:53.291,"Yeah, oh!"
00:53:53.333,00:53:55.125,WIZARD: Yes! August!
00:53:55.166,00:53:56.417,August Rush.
00:53:56.458,00:53:57.625,August Rush!
00:53:57.667,00:54:00.125,Thank you.
00:54:00.166,00:54:03.625,WIZARD: August! August!
00:54:48.458,00:54:50.083,"New York, Lyla?"
00:54:50.083,00:54:52.583,What are you doing in New York?
00:54:52.625,00:54:53.917,felt that he was alive.
00:54:53.959,00:54:59.250,"I'd see kids that would be his age, and I-I... I'd imagine what he'd look like."
00:54:59.291,00:55:00.583,"Big blue eyes, like his dad, and..."
00:55:00.625,00:55:01.583,"Oh, my God, Lyla..."
00:55:01.625,00:55:07.125,"Lizzie, I... I used to lie in bed at night, and I swear I could hear him."
00:55:07.166,00:55:08.500,I swear I could hear him.
00:55:08.542,00:55:09.792,"Lyla, calm down."
00:55:09.834,00:55:11.959,Calm down?!
00:55:12.083,00:55:13.667,How can I be calm?
00:55:13.709,00:55:16.125,I've been calm for over ten years!
00:55:16.166,00:55:17.750,And look where it's gotten me.
00:55:17.792,00:55:19.834,"Lyla, you're losing it."
00:55:19.875,00:55:21.542,You're right.
00:55:21.583,00:55:23.083,And maybe it's about time.
00:55:23.083,00:55:25.750,"Don't do anything crazy, okay, sweetie?"
00:55:25.792,00:55:27.417,"We're on our honeymoon, but we're leaving."
00:55:27.458,00:55:29.667,"We'll get there as soon as we can, okay?"
00:55:48.458,00:55:51.667,"WIZARD: Okay, Jack, he's worth three times what you're offering me, okay?"
00:55:51.709,00:55:53.542,You heard him in the park!
00:55:53.583,00:55:55.291,"Wallace, you're a pain in the ass."
00:55:55.333,00:55:57.291,"250, if he can play for two hours."
00:55:57.333,00:55:58.667,"No-- five, or he walks."
00:55:58.709,00:56:01.667,Five hundred?
00:56:01.709,00:56:03.875,"500 or he walks, all right?"
00:56:03.917,00:56:05.417,BAR OWNER: He walks?
00:56:06.917,00:56:09.709,There's no parents.
00:56:09.750,00:56:12.834,"I'm his representation, that's why I'm making the deal."
00:56:12.875,00:56:14.333,WOMAN: May I help you?
00:56:14.375,00:56:18.208,I'm trying to find my son.
00:56:18.250,00:56:19.208,Hold on a second.
00:56:19.250,00:56:21.083,Name?
00:56:33.333,00:56:35.417,Mommy!
00:56:37.083,00:56:40.333,I don't know.
00:56:56.875,00:56:59.542,"Sorry, ma'am, we're closing."
00:56:59.583,00:57:03.792,"Please, I just want to know his name."
00:57:03.834,00:57:09.750,"To even consider reestablishing contact with the child, there is a detailed process..."
00:57:09.792,00:57:13.166,I don't care about your process!
00:57:13.208,00:57:15.208,Okay?!
00:57:30.709,00:57:33.875,"Ma'am, we're closed."
00:57:38.792,00:57:39.959,LOUIS: Lyla.
00:57:40.083,00:57:43.250,Novacek.
00:57:45.583,00:57:48.166,"Hi, this is Lyla."
00:57:48.208,00:57:51.166,"BOTH: We're not here right now, so leave a message."
00:58:10.542,00:58:12.834,WIZARD: Art!
00:58:14.166,00:58:16.667,What'd I tell you about talking to strangers?
00:58:16.709,00:58:17.959,"Yeah, what's your name?"
00:58:18.083,00:58:20.333,My name is Mr. Jefferies.
00:58:20.375,00:58:21.583,Arthur.
00:58:21.625,00:58:22.959,We ain't strangers now.
00:58:23.083,00:58:25.875,"JEFFERIES: Look, Mr. Wallace, I'm..."
00:58:25.917,00:58:27.625,I'm here making my normal rounds.
00:58:27.667,00:58:29.500,I'm trying to find these kids.
00:58:29.542,00:58:31.333,"This girl, her name is Jeralda."
00:58:31.375,00:58:33.083,She should be about 14 now.
00:58:33.083,00:58:34.542,"Don't know her, Mr. Jefferies."
00:58:34.583,00:58:37.667,"Okay, well, maybe you can help me with this young man."
00:58:37.709,00:58:41.917,A little boy that came up missing recently and his name is Evan Taylor.
00:58:41.959,00:58:45.291,He's about 12.
00:58:47.166,00:58:50.583,And what if I find this Evan and I turn him over to you?
00:58:50.625,00:58:52.417,What then?
00:58:52.458,00:58:54.875,You don't care about a kid after he's in the system.
00:58:54.917,00:58:56.542,It's not like that for me.
00:58:56.583,00:58:58.709,"Oh, I know exactly what it's like."
00:58:58.750,00:59:02.709,"You don't follow up, and you throw them from place to place."
00:59:02.750,00:59:06.709,Eventually end up in a place where they kick the crap out of you.
00:59:06.750,00:59:13.667,"Go to bed at night, he tries to close his eyes, ears, shut out the world."
00:59:13.709,00:59:15.625,What happens to that kid?
00:59:15.667,00:59:17.750,What do you think he hears?
00:59:17.792,00:59:19.875,What do you think he hears?!
00:59:21.250,00:59:22.333,Nothing.
00:59:22.375,00:59:23.750,Nothing. Nothing at all.
00:59:27.291,00:59:28.458,Are you all right?
00:59:28.500,00:59:30.792,"Yeah, I'm cool."
00:59:39.125,00:59:41.583,"14th Precinct, Sergeant O'Malley."
00:59:41.625,00:59:46.834,"WIZARD: No, that doesn't cut it."
00:59:46.875,00:59:48.333,No!
00:59:48.375,00:59:50.125,"Oh, is that final?"
00:59:50.166,00:59:52.291,"Okay, well here's my final offer."
00:59:52.333,00:59:54.083,We're history!
00:59:54.125,00:59:55.667,Deal's off.
00:59:55.709,00:59:57.166,But I want to play.
00:59:57.208,01:00:00.333,"You play when I say play, you breathe when I say breathe!"
01:00:00.375,01:00:01.750,"You got that, boy?"
01:00:01.792,01:00:02.875,But I have to play.
01:00:02.917,01:00:05.083,"Wizard, I need them to hear."
01:00:05.125,01:00:07.083,You forget about your parents!
01:00:07.125,01:00:10.000,They were pretty quick to forget about you.
01:00:16.083,01:00:18.458,You don't know how it could be for you.
01:00:18.500,01:00:21.959,You do not know how precious your gift is.
01:00:22.000,01:00:25.000,"You're just a kid, you don't know."
01:00:29.500,01:00:32.291,"I do, August."
01:00:45.625,01:00:47.750,Wizard. Wizard.
01:00:47.792,01:00:49.667,Talk to me. What happened?
01:00:49.709,01:00:50.959,The cops chased him back here.
01:00:51.000,01:00:52.375,"Okay, split up."
01:00:52.417,01:00:54.250,We got help Artie.
01:00:54.291,01:00:56.208,Artie's on his own.
01:00:56.250,01:00:57.625,No!
01:00:57.667,01:01:00.083,August!
01:01:15.166,01:01:16.583,Up there!
01:01:16.625,01:01:19.083,See him? You see him?
01:01:19.083,01:01:21.083,"Hey, kid, don't move!"
01:01:21.083,01:01:23.792,Cops! Cops!
01:01:23.834,01:01:26.750,Cops! Over here!
01:01:29.375,01:01:31.375,Grab him! Grab him!
01:01:37.166,01:01:40.750,"Listen, you can't let the cops catch you."
01:01:40.792,01:01:46.875,"If they do, you don't tell them your real name, because they'll send you right back where you came from, you got that?"
01:01:46.917,01:01:51.709,"I don't want to lose you, but if we get separated, we'll meet at the arch."
01:01:53.583,01:01:55.542,Do not tell them your name.
01:01:55.583,01:01:56.542,Right.
01:01:56.583,01:01:59.333,"When I say run, you run."
01:01:59.375,01:02:01.250,Okay?
01:02:07.083,01:02:08.750,Let me see your hands.
01:02:11.083,01:02:13.709,"Run, August!"
01:02:13.750,01:02:16.125,Run!
01:02:26.291,01:02:28.083,"Hey, kid, stop!"
01:02:34.250,01:02:36.500,Open the door!
01:03:11.834,01:05:17.083,MAN: CHOIR: GIRL: WOMAN: WOMAN/GIRL: CHOIR: MAN: Hi.
01:05:17.125,01:05:18.625,I know how this looks.
01:05:18.667,01:05:20.500,You know...
01:05:20.542,01:05:22.083,I'm not crazy.
01:05:22.083,01:05:23.750,Nobody thinks you're crazy.
01:05:23.792,01:05:25.417,What's your name?
01:05:25.458,01:05:27.583,Lyla Novacek.
01:05:27.625,01:05:29.667,"Well, it's like the woman explained to you."
01:05:29.709,01:05:31.125,You fill out a couple forms...
01:05:31.166,01:05:35.250,"No, no, six months, they said-- I don't have six months for forms."
01:05:35.291,01:05:37.875,"Then I can't help you, then."
01:05:37.917,01:05:40.500,"Explain something to me, though."
01:05:40.542,01:05:42.083,Why now?
01:05:42.125,01:05:43.542,Why not before?
01:05:43.583,01:05:46.625,Why is so important that you want him now?
01:05:46.667,01:05:49.500,I've always wanted him.
01:05:51.667,01:06:01.208,"I've waited 11 years, two months and 15 days to find out that he's alive."
01:06:02.792,01:06:06.333,I've been counting.
01:06:20.959,01:06:22.917,"Hi, this is Lyla."
01:06:22.959,01:06:24.625,And Lizzie!
01:06:24.667,01:06:26.750,"BOTH: And we're not here right now, so leave a message."
01:06:47.250,01:06:49.375,OFFICER: What are you waiting for?
01:06:49.417,01:06:51.875,"You see, I know this girl that lives across the street."
01:06:51.917,01:06:54.834,"Lyla Novacek-- I've been standing outside here waiting, you know?"
01:06:54.875,01:06:57.834,I wrote her a song.
01:06:57.875,01:06:59.625,She keeps me up half the night.
01:06:59.667,01:07:01.875,"Well, I haven't seen her in a few days."
01:07:01.917,01:07:04.750,She's off on her honeymoon.
01:07:04.792,01:07:08.333,Thanks.
01:07:49.125,01:07:51.667,And this isn't your signature?
01:07:51.709,01:07:57.417,"You do realize that he's probably already been placed with a family, correct?"
01:07:57.458,01:08:00.583,"Do you have children, Mr. Jefferies?"
01:08:08.083,01:08:10.792,I did.
01:08:12.208,01:08:14.291,Then you know.
01:08:21.208,01:08:23.166,When's his birthday?
01:08:23.208,01:08:26.375,"December 17, 1995."
01:08:27.792,01:08:29.291,"Yeah, I know."
01:08:41.291,01:08:44.583,Excuse me a minute.
01:09:11.083,01:09:13.375,This is him.
01:09:17.083,01:09:20.375,Yeah.
01:09:59.500,01:10:01.417,You're the one slept under my bed?
01:10:06.250,01:10:08.000,Do you live here?
01:10:08.041,01:10:11.250,"Me and my grandma do, until our boat comes in."
01:10:13.375,01:10:15.583,Do you like music?
01:10:16.417,01:10:18.250,More than food.
01:10:20.834,01:10:22.792,Do you know your notes?
01:10:22.834,01:10:26.166,I've never seen 'em like that before.
01:10:26.208,01:10:27.625,See here.
01:10:27.667,01:10:32.083,Every... Good... Boy...
01:10:32.125,01:10:33.875,And the lines.
01:10:33.917,01:10:39.083,And... F-A-C-E in between.
01:10:39.125,01:10:43.250,And Great... Big... Dogs...
01:10:43.291,01:10:46.750,And All... Cars...
01:10:46.792,01:10:48.125,Get it?
01:10:48.166,01:10:50.458,You're like an angel.
01:10:50.500,01:10:53.125,"Okay, I gotta go."
01:10:53.166,01:10:55.458,I gotta go to school.
01:10:59.291,01:11:01.792,Can I borrow this?
01:11:01.834,01:11:03.750,Later.
01:12:31.709,01:12:34.083,Holy...
01:12:36.875,01:12:39.542,Reverend Jay!
01:13:07.333,01:13:09.417,"You're not going to believe this, Reverend Jay!"
01:13:09.458,01:13:11.625,Come quick!
01:13:11.667,01:13:13.542,You gotta see what's happened!
01:13:33.166,01:13:37.583,"HOPE: Remember in music appreciation, we had a class on Mozart?"
01:13:37.625,01:13:40.583,Remember you said he was like a musical pod?
01:13:40.625,01:13:42.875,Prodigy.
01:13:42.917,01:13:45.709,"Well, I have one of those, and he's living under my bed."
01:14:29.083,01:14:31.500,"LYLA: Mr. Jeffries, hi."
01:14:31.542,01:14:33.792,"It's, uh, Lyla Novacek again."
01:14:33.834,01:14:39.125,I was just checking in.
01:14:39.166,01:14:40.500,"Right, I-I understand."
01:14:40.542,01:14:43.750,If there's any more information or...
01:14:43.792,01:14:46.125,"Yeah, just call."
01:14:59.500,01:15:01.417,I'll take it.
01:15:01.458,01:15:04.250,How long do you think you'll be staying?
01:15:05.166,01:15:08.291,LYLA: As long as it takes.
01:15:28.166,01:15:29.083,S-Sorry.
01:15:29.125,01:15:31.333,"LYLA: I don't know, Lizzie."
01:15:31.375,01:15:33.250,It's like...
01:15:33.291,01:15:36.750,"I just woke up, and I should start playing again."
01:15:36.792,01:15:39.875,I should play.
01:15:39.917,01:15:43.709,"I know it sounds crazy, but maybe he'll hear me."
01:15:59.125,01:16:02.208,"LOUIS: Hey, Marshall. It's me."
01:16:04.250,01:16:06.417,I'm in New York.
01:16:07.458,01:16:10.208,Is the band still minus one mad Connelly brother?
01:16:10.250,01:16:14.250,"Having you guys here-- it'd be great, you know?"
01:16:14.291,01:16:17.125,Just an idea.
01:16:17.166,01:16:18.333,"Hey, Frank."
01:16:18.375,01:16:20.083,It's Louis.
01:16:20.083,01:16:22.208,Louis Connelly.
01:16:22.250,01:16:23.500,And?
01:16:23.542,01:16:26.417,I played here with me band a couple of years ago.
01:16:26.458,01:16:28.792,"Well, about ten years ago."
01:16:30.458,01:16:32.333,"Hey, hey, listen, Frank!"
01:16:33.834,01:16:36.667,"I'm going to play you one song, all right?"
01:16:36.709,01:16:38.125,Just one song.
01:16:38.166,01:16:42.750,"And if you don't like it, you can throw me out."
01:16:57.375,01:17:00.583,"WOMAN: You've brought us a prodigy, Reverend."
01:17:00.625,01:17:03.166,He is a mystery.
01:17:03.208,01:17:06.792,"Dean, I thought he was an angel."
01:17:06.834,01:17:11.959,There's no record of an August Rush anywhere.
01:17:12.083,01:17:14.959,"MAN: ...starting with a very simple, orderly chord..."
01:17:15.083,01:17:41.583,"LOUIS: LIZ: Lyla, just relax."
01:17:41.625,01:17:42.792,This piece...
01:17:42.834,01:17:43.875,You're pushing yourself too hard.
01:17:43.917,01:17:46.458,I don't know if I can do this.
01:17:46.500,01:17:49.834,You're playing with the Philharmonic.
01:17:49.875,01:17:51.917,That's great!
01:17:53.083,01:17:55.709,"Okay, let's keep going."
01:18:02.542,01:18:03.959,TEACHER: We'll start with a C-major chord.
01:18:04.083,01:18:06.291,We have a modulation to G...
01:18:06.333,01:18:11.166,"Once we get to G, you go back to C, very simple, and we have C-G-C..."
01:18:19.375,01:18:27.208,"TEACHER: At the very beginning, C-major chord, we have this chaotic evolution into a remote G-major."
01:18:29.166,01:18:32.458,"TEACHER: ...C-major chord, we're moving to a G..."
01:18:40.709,01:18:43.375,"What's this, August?"
01:18:43.417,01:18:45.917,"Um, the diminished fifth, sir."
01:18:45.959,01:18:47.917,Key change here.
01:18:47.959,01:18:55.250,And then the rise with those round horns-- the oboes-- into the allegro staccato strings.
01:19:00.166,01:19:01.542,Ah.
01:19:01.583,01:19:02.917,Mr. Rush.
01:19:06.125,01:19:07.834,I'm sorry.
01:19:07.875,01:19:10.083,"Why are you apologizing, August?"
01:19:10.125,01:19:15.291,"Sometimes I don't listen well, and I don't do the homework like I'm supposed to."
01:19:15.333,01:19:18.083,"Well, I'm sure you'll do better in the future."
01:19:28.166,01:19:31.959,The New York Philharmonic Orchestra is having a concert.
01:19:32.083,01:19:39.583,"In the history of this school, we have never performed the work of a first-year student, and certainly, no one of your age."
01:19:39.625,01:19:44.333,"But now, we've asked them if they could perform your rhapsody."
01:19:44.375,01:19:46.333,Would you like that?
01:19:46.375,01:19:47.583,"Well, good."
01:19:47.625,01:19:49.208,Good.
01:19:49.250,01:19:51.291,How many people will hear it?
01:19:53.250,01:19:57.709,"Well, it would be performed in Central Park on the Great Lawn."
01:19:57.750,01:19:58.834,A hundred?
01:19:58.875,01:20:00.625,Much more.
01:20:00.667,01:20:02.041,Thousands!
01:20:02.083,01:20:05.709,Okay. 'Cause I need to play it to a lot of people.
01:20:05.750,01:20:07.458,Lots and lots.
01:20:08.834,01:20:12.458,We'll see what we can do to help.
01:20:12.500,01:20:18.291,"DEAN: August, three artists will be performing, and you will be featured last."
01:20:30.208,01:20:32.166,DEAN: How do you do it?
01:20:32.208,01:20:36.166,How does the music...
01:20:37.959,01:20:39.041,AUGUST: I just hear it.
01:20:42.667,01:20:46.166,"Sometimes I wake up and it's there, or..."
01:20:46.208,01:20:48.667,I hear it when I'm walking down the street.
01:20:54.542,01:20:58.166,AUGUST: It's like someone's calling out to me.
01:20:58.208,01:21:01.875,Writing it all down is like I'm calling back to them.
01:21:01.917,01:21:03.417,Who?
01:21:04.750,01:21:07.083,The ones who gave me the music.
01:21:13.208,01:21:15.709,"You sure you're ready for this, Louis?"
01:21:15.750,01:21:18.083,Are you?
01:22:17.959,01:22:19.583,"Bravo, August!"
01:22:21.625,01:22:23.959,Good one!
01:22:27.083,01:22:29.250,August! Boy!
01:22:29.291,01:22:31.291,You're a hard guy to find!
01:22:33.083,01:22:36.709,Been looking everywhere for you.
01:22:36.750,01:22:38.667,You're interrupting a rehearsal here.
01:22:38.709,01:22:41.625,"WIZARD: Yeah, rehearsal, right."
01:22:41.667,01:22:43.500,"Come here to me, son."
01:22:53.083,01:22:55.458,Come here.
01:22:57.333,01:22:59.709,What'd they do to you?
01:23:01.083,01:23:03.083,Nothing.
01:23:04.625,01:23:07.166,"These people can steal you, son."
01:23:07.208,01:23:10.500,"TEACHER: Sir, whomever you are, you don't have the right."
01:23:10.542,01:23:13.542,"I'm his father, all right?"
01:23:16.375,01:23:18.667,I'll take you home now.
01:23:18.709,01:23:20.208,Come on.
01:23:20.250,01:23:22.208,But I have a concert.
01:23:22.250,01:23:23.959,I like it here.
01:23:24.083,01:23:25.083,He's a remarkable boy...
01:23:25.125,01:23:26.500,You don't think I know that?
01:23:26.542,01:23:29.166,"What'd you do, you just snatch him up off the street?"
01:23:29.208,01:23:30.709,That gives you the right?
01:23:30.750,01:23:33.625,TEACHER: Wait a moment-- we've been teaching him here.
01:23:33.667,01:23:38.500,"What are you gonna do, fill his head with classical theory and rules?"
01:23:38.542,01:23:41.834,You can't learn music from books!
01:23:41.875,01:23:43.709,It's out there.
01:23:44.750,01:23:47.750,You teach him? Ha!
01:23:47.792,01:23:49.250,He teaches you.
01:23:49.291,01:23:51.250,You learn from him.
01:23:51.291,01:23:53.750,"We are, I assure you, Mr. Rush-- every day."
01:23:53.792,01:23:56.083,Come on.
01:23:56.083,01:23:57.083,Come on.
01:23:58.583,01:24:00.667,"TEACHER: Mr. Rush, please."
01:24:00.709,01:24:05.208,Do you have any idea of the importance of the concert tomorrow night for August?
01:24:06.583,01:24:08.125,"TEACHER: August, wait, listen."
01:24:08.166,01:24:11.792,"You got to tell me right now, is this man really your father?"
01:24:15.542,01:24:17.583,You can tell me the truth.
01:24:18.458,01:24:21.542,I know your real name...
01:24:21.583,01:24:24.083,Evan.
01:24:24.083,01:24:26.375,August.
01:24:26.417,01:24:28.291,Evan.
01:24:30.291,01:24:32.458,Is he your father?
01:24:35.750,01:24:39.291,He taught me everything I know.
01:24:51.166,01:24:53.250,"ARTHUR: We are back, we are back."
01:24:55.709,01:24:59.583,"Don't make it harder for yourself, Aug."
01:24:59.625,01:25:01.625,Wizard's not so bad.
01:25:02.834,01:25:05.583,"You saw the kid, right?"
01:25:05.625,01:25:08.917,"Okay, here's the deal-- thousand a night, two weeks minimum, three cities guaranteed."
01:25:08.959,01:25:11.625,Then we ship him out to your partner on the West Coast.
01:25:11.667,01:25:14.583,ARTHUR: He just ain't feeling well.
01:25:14.625,01:25:18.166,He said you the only one who gonna make him feel better.
01:25:25.250,01:25:26.291,Competition.
01:25:26.333,01:25:27.959,"All right, I'll be back."
01:25:28.083,01:25:29.333,You do what you do.
01:25:32.250,01:25:34.458,WOMAN: Yo! Yo!
01:25:40.500,01:25:42.834,I'm his representation; that's why I'm making the deal.
01:25:43.834,01:25:45.166,Come on.
01:25:45.208,01:25:46.834,"No, there's no parents."
01:26:16.375,01:26:18.709,"Great sounds, kid."
01:26:20.875,01:26:22.917,Gibson J-200?
01:26:23.959,01:26:25.917,It's beautiful.
01:26:25.959,01:26:27.834,Can I see her?
01:26:31.750,01:26:34.208,"Hey, it's okay."
01:26:34.250,01:26:36.875,"I'm a musician, too."
01:26:47.583,01:26:49.458,"Oh, yeah!"
01:27:02.250,01:27:04.166,Nice action.
01:27:04.208,01:27:06.542,You're pretty good.
01:27:06.583,01:27:09.333,Thanks.
01:27:09.375,01:27:11.834,See what you can do with mine.
01:29:06.083,01:29:08.250,How long you been playing?
01:29:08.291,01:29:10.125,Six months.
01:29:10.166,01:29:11.583,Six months?
01:29:11.625,01:29:14.834,How'd you learn how to play like that in six months?
01:29:14.875,01:29:16.583,Juilliard.
01:29:17.417,01:29:19.208,Juilliard?
01:29:19.250,01:29:20.667,"Yes, sir."
01:29:20.709,01:29:22.834,I have my own concert tonight.
01:29:22.875,01:29:25.625,Do you reckon I should believe you?
01:29:25.667,01:29:29.458,Yeah. But I can't go.
01:29:29.500,01:29:31.208,Why is that?
01:29:31.250,01:29:34.583,It's kind of a long story.
01:29:34.625,01:29:43.458,"Well, if I went to Juilliard, and I had a concert tonight, I wouldn't miss it for the world."
01:29:44.291,01:29:47.125,Yeah.
01:29:50.083,01:29:53.834,But what if something bad were to happen if you did it?
01:29:54.750,01:30:00.709,"You never quit on your music, no matter what happens."
01:30:00.750,01:30:08.625,"'Cause anytime something bad happens to you, it's the one place you can escape to and just let it go."
01:30:10.291,01:30:13.375,I learned that the hard way.
01:30:13.417,01:30:16.458,"And anyway, look at me."
01:30:17.291,01:30:19.875,Nothing bad's gonna happen.
01:30:19.917,01:30:23.166,You got to have a little faith.
01:30:32.875,01:30:34.333,I'm Louis.
01:30:34.375,01:30:36.041,Ev...
01:30:36.083,01:30:37.417,August.
01:30:37.458,01:30:38.959,August Rush.
01:30:39.000,01:30:42.291,August Rush.
01:30:42.333,01:30:44.500,Cool name.
01:30:44.542,01:30:46.834,WIZARD: August!
01:30:46.875,01:30:48.417,Come on!
01:30:51.458,01:30:53.583,"I got to go, August."
01:30:59.166,01:31:01.208,Bye.
01:31:01.250,01:31:03.125,Yeah.
01:31:04.834,01:31:06.667,Bye.
01:31:15.667,01:31:18.500,Bye.
01:31:36.083,01:31:40.083,"Yes, I made him memorize our number."
01:31:41.458,01:31:42.750,I understand.
01:31:42.792,01:31:45.083,Your department's doing everything they can.
01:32:02.959,01:32:06.542,Do you think anything bad happened to him?
01:32:06.583,01:32:09.083,I'm sure he's fine.
01:32:09.083,01:32:10.625,I prayed for him.
01:32:10.667,01:32:12.542,Did you?
01:32:12.583,01:32:14.166,Yeah.
01:32:14.208,01:32:18.917,"Well, if his father loves him like he should..."
01:32:20.083,01:32:23.083,...then he'll do what's best for his son.
01:32:24.583,01:32:26.375,"You believe that, don't you?"
01:32:26.417,01:32:28.375,Yeah.
01:32:28.417,01:32:31.250,"Good. Now, go get ready."
01:32:42.083,01:32:50.500,"DEAN: Welcome to our concert in the park, and the Mercedes Drive Your Future Scholarship Celebration."
01:32:50.542,01:33:00.834,"Now it is with enormous pleasure that I welcome back to the concert stage one of Juilliard's own, Lyla Novacek."
01:35:05.083,01:35:07.208,I have to go now.
01:35:18.500,01:35:20.959,I'm not coming back this time.
01:35:22.166,01:35:23.917,"He's just kidding, Wizard."
01:35:24.959,01:35:28.250,"Me and August have an understanding, don't we?"
01:35:32.750,01:35:35.458,"Aug, you can't leave me, man."
01:35:35.500,01:35:37.208,"Yes, I can."
01:35:37.250,01:35:40.709,"'Cause you have to find your parents, right?"
01:35:40.750,01:35:43.250,Yeah.
01:35:43.291,01:35:48.834,"Well, all my money's on the fact your folks won't be able to find you."
01:35:48.875,01:35:50.250,You know why?
01:35:50.291,01:35:52.750,Because they can't hear you.
01:35:52.792,01:35:54.333,They're probably dead.
01:35:54.375,01:35:57.542,You're not going anywhere.
01:36:08.875,01:36:10.125,"Nowhere to go, son."
01:36:20.709,01:36:22.917,"ARTHUR: Run, boy!"
01:36:22.959,01:36:24.667,"Run, August, run!"
01:36:45.625,01:36:48.333,August!
01:37:37.625,01:37:41.083,August!
01:37:59.792,01:38:03.709,"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
01:38:03.750,01:38:13.166,"Music has always fascinated us in the way that it communicates-- without words, without pictures."
01:38:13.208,01:38:16.959,And that leads us to our final performance.
01:38:19.834,01:38:22.709,"Wait, how much longer to the airport?"
01:38:26.125,01:38:30.083,"Bring you back to the old days, eh, Louis?"
01:38:45.792,01:38:47.917,August Rush?
01:38:47.959,01:38:50.500,Evan Taylor?
01:39:05.542,01:39:11.625,"DEAN: Unfortunately, our last performer seems to have..."
01:39:11.667,01:39:13.709,He's here! He's here!
01:39:13.750,01:39:15.750,Oh. Excellent.
01:39:15.792,01:39:23.750,Perhaps there's no one else who can better personify the mystery that is music...
01:39:23.792,01:39:26.333,than our final composer.
01:41:16.583,01:41:19.083,"Hey, what's that?"
01:41:19.083,01:41:22.125,Concerts in the park every spring.
01:41:49.625,01:41:52.291,Let me out.
01:41:52.333,01:41:54.125,Let me out!
01:41:54.166,01:41:56.166,LOUIS: Let me out!
01:42:43.166,01:46:40.250,HOPE: EVAN: The music is all around us.
01:46:40.291,01:46:42.875,All you have to do...
01:46:42.917,01:46:45.083,is listen.
