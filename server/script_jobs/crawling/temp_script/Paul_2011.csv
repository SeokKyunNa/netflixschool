00:00:55.472,00:01:00.351,"Paul, having proclaimed himself King of Blue Magic Land, offers Tom the Hawkman the command of the army..."
00:01:20.955,00:01:24.083,"Go on, then, Paul. Don't be long."

00:03:36.758,00:03:38.718,You know? It feels so...
00:03:38.801,00:03:40.720,-Right. -Yeah.
00:03:40.803,00:03:45.850,"We're 5,339 miles from home, and yet somehow I feel like we belong."
00:03:45.934,00:03:48.102,I know what you mean. I know what you mean.
00:03:48.186,00:03:51.731,"I think this is probably the most fun I have ever had, you know?"
00:03:51.814,00:03:53.691,"I'm so glad we came, Clive."
00:03:55.443,00:03:56.527,Clive?
00:03:58.529,00:03:59.822,-May I? -Be my guest.
00:03:59.906,00:04:02.283,I was over there on my own.
00:04:02.367,00:04:04.202,That there is a Black Vampire.
00:04:07.038,00:04:10.708,"-How much? -$1,349.99."
00:04:16.047,00:04:17.048,Fair enough.
00:04:18.758,00:04:21.135,I can't believe we're gonna meet Adam Shadowchild.
00:04:21.219,00:04:23.638,"I know. He's, like, the coolest man in the world."
00:04:23.721,00:04:25.139,Thank you.
00:04:26.766,00:04:29.394,"Come forth. Welcome, my friends."
00:04:29.477,00:04:38.486,"I just wanted to say that the Planet Fall trilogy has been a huge influence on me and my work, and Sebastian Rico is a wonderful protagonist."
00:04:38.569,00:04:41.197,Don't tell me. You're a writer.
00:04:41.281,00:04:43.324,"-I am. Yeah. -Well, good."
00:04:43.408,00:04:45.952,He actually won a Nebulon Award in 1992.
00:04:46.035,00:04:49.539,"-I'm working on a follow-up. -Oh. Well, I'd love to see that."
00:04:49.622,00:04:51.332,"-Oh, not today. - t's right here."
00:04:51.416,00:04:55.003,No. It's a legal thing. I'm sure it's... I'm sure it's good.
00:04:55.086,00:04:57.880,That is a wonderful cover. Three tits.
00:04:59.799,00:05:01.009,Awesome.
00:05:01.092,00:05:03.594,-That was Graeme. My illustrator. -I'm an artist.
00:05:03.678,00:05:05.847,"-Move along, please, guys. -Yes."
00:05:05.930,00:05:07.640,"No, no. I..."
00:05:07.724,00:05:08.975,Thank you.
00:05:13.313,00:05:14.814,Then fuck off.
00:05:14.897,00:05:17.150,"Let's get a picture of you, me and Adam."
00:05:17.233,00:05:18.484,"-OK, ready? -Ready."
00:05:21.154,00:05:22.071,Whah!
00:05:28.453,00:05:29.454,Yes.
00:05:29.537,00:05:31.873,-Is that the RV place? -Yes.
00:05:31.956,00:05:34.250,And there's definitely two single beds?
00:05:34.334,00:05:37.628,Because there's been a bit of a mix-up at the hotel.
00:05:37.712,00:05:39.422,OK. Excellent. Thank you very much.
00:05:39.505,00:05:42.091,And have a nice day to you as well.
00:05:43.926,00:05:46.095,-Is it here? -It's in the car park.
00:05:46.179,00:05:47.513,I think you mean the parking lot.
00:05:52.435,00:05:56.647,"It's amazing, isn't it? We're actually here. America. Huh?"
00:05:56.731,00:05:59.192,How long have we dreamt about this?
00:05:59.275,00:06:01.861,-Since we were kids. -Yeah.
00:06:01.944,00:06:04.697,Now look at us. Grown men.
00:06:08.201,00:06:09.786,-Hi. -Hiya.
00:06:09.869,00:06:12.288,"-Good evening, sir. -Come on in."
00:06:13.414,00:06:15.458,"Uh, where can I set these down?"
00:06:15.541,00:06:18.961,"-You can put it on the bed, or uh... -You guys on honeymoon?"
00:06:21.881,00:06:24.258,"-No. No, it's all... -No, silly. We're just friends."
00:06:24.342,00:06:26.803,We had a mix-up. The reservations were messed up.
00:06:26.886,00:06:28.888,Pop it on the table here. Let me clear all that.
00:06:28.971,00:06:31.557,"-Ah, goin' on a road trip, huh? -Yeah."
00:06:31.641,00:06:38.147,"Well, you know, what better way to follow Comic-Con than a tour of America's most famous UFO hot spots?"
00:06:38.231,00:06:39.440,Huh?
00:06:39.524,00:06:44.278,"You know, we're gonna... Area 51 and the Black Mailbox in Nevada."
00:06:44.362,00:06:51.661,"Then down to Camp Verde, then to Apache Junction, and on down to Roswell, New Mexico, for the site of the famous crash of '47."
00:06:51.744,00:06:53.663,-Everybody knows that. -Stop it.
00:06:53.746,00:06:55.873,It's an alleged site at this point.
00:06:55.957,00:06:59.127,Why would they admit there was a crash if the crash happened somewhere else?
00:06:59.210,00:07:01.921,-Let's just agree to disagree. -Agree to disagree. Again.
00:07:05.133,00:07:07.009,Do you believe in aliens?
00:07:07.093,00:07:09.512,"What do you mean, aliens?"
00:07:13.349,00:07:15.852,"-I'll sign the check, shall I? -I'll get rid of the map."
00:07:16.602,00:07:20.022,-Get that out of your way. -Pizza grease on a map is the worst thing.
00:07:20.106,00:07:21.315,Thank you.
00:07:21.399,00:07:24.193,"-Have a nice honeymoon. -Oh, thank you."
00:07:47.133,00:07:48.468,That one.
00:07:49.802,00:07:51.137,Ow!
00:08:15.953,00:08:18.623,Watch the skies or Alien on board?
00:08:18.706,00:08:21.501,"Alien, yeah? Alien on board, please."
00:08:21.584,00:08:24.337,"OK, if you're sure."
00:08:25.338,00:08:28.132,"So, how was Comic-Con?"
00:08:28.216,00:08:30.009,We met Adam Shadowchild.
00:08:30.092,00:08:32.428,Who the hell is Adam Shadowchild?
00:08:32.512,00:08:34.472,"Oh, he wrote The Venusian Pangenesis."
00:08:34.555,00:08:35.973,I didn't read that one.
00:08:36.057,00:08:38.059,Jenny Starpepper And The Great Brass Hen?
00:08:38.142,00:08:40.353,-No. -The Robot's Mistress?
00:08:40.436,00:08:42.647,-I like romances. -That's kind of a romance.
00:08:42.730,00:08:45.816,"-Between a woman and a machine? -Uh, yeah."
00:08:50.154,00:08:52.823,"So, you fellas set, or can I get you somethin' else?"
00:08:52.907,00:08:55.076,"I think I would like a refill of coffee, please, Pat."
00:08:55.159,00:08:56.953,"All right, then. How about you, pumpkin?"
00:08:57.036,00:08:59.413,"Uh, could I have an ET Malt, please?"
00:08:59.497,00:09:01.332,Mmm! You want that with a sparkler?
00:09:05.211,00:09:06.546,I will take that as a yes.
00:09:07.838,00:09:09.257,I think I might do a toilet.
00:09:21.269,00:09:23.813,"-I love this joke. -And he goes, Cu-cu-cu-cut her loose!"
00:09:31.404,00:09:32.613,What?
00:09:34.782,00:09:37.868,"-I don't know you. -Ooh. So, comics."
00:09:40.788,00:09:42.707,How you think that makes me feel?
00:09:44.000,00:09:45.001,Be rude to me.
00:09:46.919,00:09:48.379,Hmm.
00:09:48.462,00:09:49.839,Mm-hm.
00:09:49.922,00:09:52.008,Ooh. Eggy.
00:09:52.091,00:09:54.510,An alien just sicked up in my palms.
00:09:54.594,00:09:55.678,"-Clive, um... -What?"
00:09:58.055,00:10:01.350,They've got a soap dispenser shaped like an alien's head. It's brilliant!
00:10:14.947,00:10:17.950,"Hey, fellas. How you doin' today?"
00:10:18.034,00:10:20.077,"What is this, some kinda gay bar?"
00:10:20.161,00:10:24.332,No. Just a place where you can get a bite to eat and maybe share a close encounter.
00:10:24.415,00:10:26.584,"Yep, sounds like a gay bar."
00:10:41.390,00:10:43.184,-I'll get this. -Just leave it. Leave it.
00:10:43.267,00:10:45.061,Thank you very much.
00:10:51.567,00:10:54.654,"-Don't you put those queer eyes on me. -No, I forgot the sticker."
00:10:54.737,00:10:57.239,-What took you so long? -I was putting the sticker on.
00:10:57.323,00:10:59.533,"Oh, they were an odd pair, weren't they?"
00:10:59.617,00:11:01.410,Yeah. Definitely not my kind of people.
00:11:01.494,00:11:04.789,"Yeah, well, I doubt very much we'll be seeing them again."
00:11:04.872,00:11:06.290,Yeah.
00:11:08.292,00:11:10.294,"-That wasn't their truck, was it? -No."
00:11:10.378,00:11:12.171,-Should I go and have a look? -No!
00:11:28.562,00:11:30.189,The Black Mailbox.
00:11:34.485,00:11:38.989,"Do you remember when we Googled it on your mum's computer, and the phone rang and you thought it was the FBI?"
00:11:39.073,00:11:40.908,I didn't really think it was the FBI.
00:11:40.991,00:11:42.827,-You started crying. -I had jet lag.
00:11:42.910,00:11:44.578,We'd only been to Brussels.
00:11:44.662,00:11:46.872,-Go stand next to it. -Yeah.
00:11:46.956,00:11:48.707,Smile.
00:11:49.875,00:11:52.545,Good. Imagine if we got buzzed by a craft.
00:11:55.172,00:11:56.257,Smile.
00:11:59.969,00:12:01.804,What would you do if they actually landed?
00:12:01.887,00:12:04.640,"Well, I mean, first contact is a big responsibility, isn't it?"
00:12:04.723,00:12:06.475,"They come in peace, we go to pieces?"
00:12:06.559,00:12:09.478,-Nuh-uh. That's not how I roll. -No.
00:12:11.230,00:12:12.356,What is that?
00:12:19.613,00:12:21.449,Do you think that's those men?
00:12:22.867,00:12:24.201,No.
00:12:26.454,00:12:29.039,-We've seen enough of this. -Let's just...
00:12:29.123,00:12:31.834,"-Let's go. -Go, go, go, go."
00:12:37.131,00:12:39.467,-They're gaining. -This is like Deliverance.
00:12:39.550,00:12:41.594,They're gonna rape us and break our arms.
00:12:41.677,00:12:43.345,I don't want my arms broken!
00:12:44.096,00:12:46.682,-I need the toilet. -You've just been.
00:12:51.312,00:12:52.396,Don't let them go past!
00:12:52.480,00:12:53.939,What do you want me to do? Ram them?
00:12:57.860,00:13:00.654,It's not them! It's not them. It's not them.
00:13:02.948,00:13:05.367,-That was awful. -I was terrified.
00:14:06.220,00:14:08.347,-Maybe you should call for help. -Yeah.
00:14:13.018,00:14:14.228,It's ringing.
00:14:28.868,00:14:33.163,Put... the phone... down.
00:14:36.208,00:14:38.586,"Oh, fuck me. What have you done to him?!"
00:14:38.669,00:14:40.588,I didn't do anything to him. He fainted.
00:14:40.671,00:14:42.172,"Yeah, but you... you made him faint."
00:14:42.256,00:14:44.592,"Yes, but it's not like I set my phaser to Faint."
00:14:44.675,00:14:46.719,"-You've got a phaser?! -No, I don't. Look!"
00:14:46.802,00:14:49.680,Listen. Hey. I really need your help.
00:14:49.763,00:14:51.765,OK? Can we get this guy back onto your wagon?
00:14:54.476,00:14:55.769,Are you an alien?
00:14:55.853,00:14:57.521,"To you, I am. Yes."
00:14:57.605,00:14:58.689,Are you gonna probe us?
00:14:58.772,00:15:02.359,Why does everyone always assume that? What am I doing? Am I harvesting farts?
00:15:02.443,00:15:03.777,How much can I learn from an ass?!
00:15:05.738,00:15:06.989,I'm sorry. What's your name?
00:15:07.072,00:15:08.949,It's Graeme Willy.
00:15:09.033,00:15:10.242,And what's his name?
00:15:10.326,00:15:12.369,That's the writer Clive Gollings.
00:15:12.453,00:15:14.121,"OK, cool. I'm Paul."
00:15:14.204,00:15:15.247,Paul?
00:15:15.331,00:15:16.999,Yeah. It's a nickname that stuck.
00:15:17.082,00:15:19.752,My ship crashed on a dog. It doesn't matter.
00:15:19.835,00:15:23.756,"Look, can we get the writer Clive Gollings back on the RV and get the hell outta here, please?"
00:15:23.839,00:15:29.345,"I can't... It's-- I'm in a hell of a pickle, and if you don't help me, I could die on this road tonight."
00:15:29.428,00:15:31.555,"I dunno, we're on quite a tight schedule."
00:15:32.556,00:15:36.352,"Look, man. Sometimes you just gotta roll the dice."
00:15:36.435,00:15:37.728,What do you say?
00:15:45.903,00:15:48.530,-OK. -OK. Perfect. Great.
00:15:48.614,00:15:50.491,OK. Help me. Help me grab him. Let's...
00:15:52.368,00:15:54.328,This man's peed his pants.
00:15:54.411,00:15:56.288,Yeah. He's got a child's bladder.
00:15:56.372,00:15:57.748,"Oh, fantastic."
00:16:16.058,00:16:18.310,Doesn't this thing go any faster?
00:16:18.394,00:16:23.315,"Well, I'm... I'm sorry. The speed limit's 70, so-- Screw the speed limit. Actually, no."
00:16:23.399,00:16:26.402,"Ooh, yeah. Don't screw it. That's good thinking."
00:16:26.485,00:16:28.779,OK. Stay inconspicuous. That's good.
00:16:28.862,00:16:30.197,How come I can understand you?
00:16:30.280,00:16:32.574,Are you using some sort of neural language router?
00:16:32.658,00:16:35.327,"Actually, I'm speaking English, you fucking idiot."
00:16:35.411,00:16:38.539,I'm sorry. You're in shock right now.
00:16:38.622,00:16:42.334,I understand this must be very weird for you.
00:16:42.418,00:16:50.175,Just act normal and drive north. OK Gotta get as much distance as we can between us and the big guy.
00:17:43.270,00:17:46.190,-Bastard jacked a native? -Could be two.
00:17:46.273,00:17:48.650,Don't you think this is all a bit of a coincidence?
00:17:48.734,00:17:52.029,-Are you suggesting he knew? -Little fucker might've phoned home.
00:17:54.948,00:17:57.868,"Zoil, we need to break out the big guns."
00:17:57.951,00:18:03.248,Do you think that that's wise? The last thing we need is... a hoo-ha.
00:18:04.917,00:18:08.378,"Listen, I got two rookies on a special mission 75 klicks north of you."
00:18:10.172,00:18:13.175,These are just civilians. Why don't you let me take care of it?
00:18:13.258,00:18:14.885,You might need the extra muscle.
00:18:14.968,00:18:18.764,Just keep 'em in the dark. I don't want any loose ends.
00:18:18.847,00:18:20.891,These roads can be treacherous at night.
00:18:22.810,00:18:26.522,People get in accidents all the time.
00:18:37.449,00:18:40.244,Heads up. We just got reassigned.
00:18:40.327,00:18:43.997,-Nice. What about the sandwich? -She said we could share it.
00:18:44.081,00:18:46.333,"-Oh, I love this job. -Mm-hm."
00:19:13.068,00:19:15.279,I love pistachios.
00:19:15.362,00:19:17.489,"I hate when you get a closed one, right?"
00:19:23.912,00:19:27.332,"-No. That's mussels. -No. Uh, it's pistachios."
00:19:28.375,00:19:30.377,-Stop it! What are you doing?! -Who are you?
00:19:31.879,00:19:33.589,-Stop! -He's OK. He's fine!
00:19:33.672,00:19:35.632,He's friendly. His name's Paul.
00:19:38.135,00:19:39.845,Aliens aren't called Paul.
00:19:39.928,00:19:43.265,Was that Klingon? You psychotic nerd!
00:19:43.348,00:19:48.353,"Listen, Paul is from a small M-class planet in the northern spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy."
00:19:48.437,00:19:50.689,-Thank you. -He looks too obvious.
00:19:50.772,00:19:53.066,"There's a reason for that, Clive."
00:19:53.150,00:19:59.281,Over the last 60 years the human race has been drip-fed images of my face on lunch boxes and T-shirts and shit.
00:19:59.364,00:20:02.826,"Just in case our species do meet, you don't have a fucking spaz attack."
00:20:05.704,00:20:08.665,That's my fucking jorph! Get your fucking fingers out of there!
00:20:08.749,00:20:10.500,"If I get a jorph infection, you're dead."
00:20:16.924,00:20:18.425,Paul.
00:20:18.508,00:20:19.927,Paul?
00:20:20.010,00:20:22.137,"OK. OK, this... This could be it."
00:20:22.221,00:20:25.474,-So what are we looking for again? -I don't know.
00:20:29.728,00:20:31.521,What brings you to the USA?
00:20:31.605,00:20:35.108,-We're on holiday. -We've been to Comic-Con.
00:20:35.192,00:20:38.987,"Comic-Con? Well, don't tell O'Reilly. He loves that dweeb shit."
00:20:40.322,00:20:41.657,You guys know Benny Hill?
00:20:42.699,00:20:43.742,-No. -No.
00:20:46.662,00:20:49.414,-What? What? -Look at this!
00:20:49.498,00:20:51.458,These guys have met Adam Shadowchild.
00:20:51.541,00:20:54.378,Who the hell's Adam Shadowchild?
00:20:54.461,00:20:56.588,He wrote The Jupiter Praxis.
00:20:56.672,00:20:57.839,What?
00:20:57.923,00:20:59.925,Jenny Starpepper And The Huge White Gibbon.
00:21:00.008,00:21:02.427,-Huh? -Night of the Moths.
00:21:02.511,00:21:05.472,-Are you speaking English? -Night of the Moths. Brilliant book.
00:21:07.641,00:21:09.101,He was a bit intense.
00:21:09.184,00:21:11.645,"-Oh, well, he's an artist. -Let me see this."
00:21:11.728,00:21:13.605,"What is this, nerd porn?"
00:21:13.689,00:21:16.108,"-Uh, no, that's Clive's-- -It's my novel."
00:21:16.191,00:21:17.401,OK.
00:21:17.484,00:21:20.279,Ah! Three tits. That's awesome.
00:21:20.362,00:21:22.948,You guys should've given her four tits.
00:21:23.031,00:21:24.741,That's just sick.
00:21:24.825,00:21:26.326,I was just sayin'.
00:21:26.410,00:21:28.245,"Hey, do you think this is it?"
00:21:28.328,00:21:30.080,Doubtful. What else did you find in there?
00:21:30.163,00:21:32.291,Not much. Just some pissy jeans.
00:21:33.292,00:21:36.211,"-Oh, Clive's got a child's-- -Shut up. Shut up."
00:21:36.295,00:21:37.879,"OK, you guys can go."
00:21:37.963,00:21:38.964,Thank you.
00:21:39.047,00:21:40.632,May I have my...? Thank you very much.
00:21:41.550,00:21:43.593,May I ask what you're searching for?
00:21:45.762,00:21:46.722,No.
00:21:48.557,00:21:50.017,"Thank you. Come on, Graeme."
00:21:54.813,00:21:55.814,You caught that?
00:21:55.897,00:21:58.734,"Did I catch it? Oh, my God. Like a cold I caught it."
00:22:02.112,00:22:04.990,"I think it's pretty obvious what happened there, isn't it?"
00:22:05.073,00:22:06.074,Is it?
00:22:07.034,00:22:09.995,The government used some kind of neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox.
00:22:10.078,00:22:13.165,Caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien.
00:22:13.248,00:22:14.666,It makes complete sense.
00:22:16.335,00:22:18.003,Oh!
00:22:25.594,00:22:26.720,"Oh, no."
00:22:27.679,00:22:32.184,"What? Come on, grow up. You guys seen my shorts?"
00:22:32.267,00:22:35.312,How... How did you... How did you do that? How did you go invisible?
00:22:36.021,00:22:38.273,"-It's a camouflage response. -What, like Predator?"
00:22:38.356,00:22:40.901,"Exactly, although I can only do it while I'm holding my breath."
00:22:50.827,00:22:52.329,Hey?
00:22:52.412,00:22:55.624,"It's all right for you, isn't it? You'll go back to Area 51."
00:22:55.707,00:23:00.170,We'll be arrested for harboring a fugitive and sent to Guantánamo Bay.
00:23:00.253,00:23:04.633,"Why don't I go make some bagels and coffee, leave you two alone?"
00:23:07.761,00:23:08.970,"What's the matter, Clive?"
00:23:10.222,00:23:14.059,There is an alien in the kitchenette making bagels and coffee.
00:23:14.142,00:23:16.645,"-Did you want tea? -No, I don't want tea."
00:23:16.728,00:23:20.357,"Right, because tea is weird in America. They leave the bag in."
00:23:20.440,00:23:26.780,"What's weird is the fact that we have picked up an extra-terrestrial hitchhiker, and you seem completely fine with it."
00:23:28.698,00:23:30.075,Ooh! Marmite.
00:23:30.909,00:23:33.954,"He said his life's in danger. He needs our help, you know?"
00:23:34.037,00:23:37.833,I mean... sometimes you've just gotta roll the dice.
00:23:37.916,00:23:43.922,What if we wake up and find him inserting a probe into our anus?
00:23:44.005,00:23:46.133,Apparently they don't do that.
00:23:46.758,00:23:49.427,Anyone want one of these?
00:23:49.511,00:23:51.179,Huh? Anyone?
00:23:51.263,00:23:53.765,Anyone? Huh?
00:24:00.355,00:24:02.691,"...48, 49, 50."
00:24:02.774,00:24:05.110,"Coming, ready or not, you son of a bitch."
00:24:10.365,00:24:11.825,Where's the other one?
00:24:11.908,00:24:13.118,"I don't know, sir."
00:24:13.201,00:24:16.246,Uh... Haggard!
00:24:17.455,00:24:18.999,Sorry. We were...
00:24:20.000,00:24:21.543,Haggard!
00:24:30.093,00:24:32.929,"We were just playing hide-and-seek, cos we had a lot of time."
00:24:35.765,00:24:37.350,You have any traffic through here?
00:24:37.434,00:24:41.980,No. Just a couple of hillbilly types and two nerds in an RV.
00:24:42.063,00:24:43.565,"Nerds, huh?"
00:24:43.648,00:24:46.693,Yes. They were coming from Comic-Con. They met Adam Shadowchild.
00:24:46.776,00:24:48.778,Who the hell's Adam Shadowchild?
00:24:48.862,00:24:51.573,"Oh, he... He wrote Prison Hulk 441."
00:24:51.656,00:24:53.867,OK? Jenny Starpepper And The Spitting Worm.
00:24:53.950,00:24:55.368,-Right? Fluxing Uranus. -Jesus.
00:24:55.452,00:24:56.995,"You know you're a grown man, right?"
00:24:58.205,00:25:00.957,"Probably shave, pay taxes, have pubic hair."
00:25:01.041,00:25:02.918,All of those things.
00:25:03.001,00:25:04.794,"-Did you search that vehicle? -Yes, sir."
00:25:04.878,00:25:05.629,What'd you find?
00:25:05.712,00:25:11.426,"Uh, nothing much. Just a book with a green woman with three... titties."
00:25:11.509,00:25:14.512,-Titties. Three titties. -Three tits. That's awesome.
00:25:14.596,00:25:18.266,"Oh, and some pissy jeans. Guy pissed himself. I don't know if..."
00:25:18.350,00:25:20.727,-Close that. -...he had a pre-existing problem.
00:25:21.770,00:25:23.021,"Listen to me, Frick and Fuck."
00:25:23.104,00:25:26.399,I want everything you can remember about the pissy nerds. OK? We're leaving.
00:25:28.109,00:25:29.653,"What about the roadblock, sir?"
00:25:29.736,00:25:30.987,It didn't work.
00:25:49.172,00:25:51.883,Hey! Reese's Pieces.
00:25:51.967,00:25:53.843,Yes! Thank you.
00:26:22.163,00:26:25.875,-Must've been the boys out at the base. -Yeah.
00:26:28.336,00:26:30.130,"-That's a bit much, isn't it? -What?"
00:26:30.213,00:26:33.049,-Put it all back. -What about Paul's Reese's Pieces?
00:26:33.133,00:26:34.175,Just hurry up.
00:26:40.223,00:26:42.559,"Oh. You sure? Thank you. Thank you, Officer."
00:26:48.023,00:26:49.357,"-Oh. -Oh, the... Yes."
00:26:49.441,00:26:51.693,-The RV is ours. -No. Yes.
00:26:51.776,00:26:52.861,Where are you boys from?
00:26:55.071,00:26:57.657,I heard about England. No guns.
00:26:57.741,00:27:02.537,"-Not many. -No, not really. Just, you know, farmers."
00:27:03.455,00:27:05.957,"Well, how are police supposed to shoot anybody?"
00:27:07.625,00:27:09.586,"-Well, they don't. -They try not to."
00:27:17.135,00:27:21.056,"Um, here's 20. Just keep the change. Keep the change."
00:27:21.139,00:27:23.266,Give it to charity or something.
00:27:30.148,00:27:31.816,That cop didn't suspect a thing.
00:27:31.900,00:27:35.236,"And Clive, you didn't pee your pants."
00:27:35.320,00:27:38.740,"I don't mean to be a stick in the mud, but you are asking a lot of us, all right?"
00:27:38.823,00:27:41.868,We've only just met. We don't know where we're going or why.
00:27:41.951,00:27:44.329,Do you not think we're due an explanation?
00:27:44.412,00:27:47.332,"Look, the less you guys know the better."
00:27:47.415,00:27:49.167,I want you to have plausible deniability.
00:27:49.250,00:27:54.047,Let's just say I spent a long time at that base thinking I was a guest.
00:27:54.130,00:27:57.842,Turns out I was a prisoner.
00:27:57.926,00:28:01.471,But don't worry. I got it all under...
00:28:08.061,00:28:10.188,"Fuck, that made me jump."
00:28:10.271,00:28:12.941,"-Poor little thing. -Nothing you could've done, mate."
00:28:17.779,00:28:19.614,What uh... What are you doin'?
00:28:45.515,00:28:46.766,It's a miracle.
00:28:49.936,00:28:52.021,"Man, I'm gonna miss these. Mmm!"
00:28:52.105,00:28:53.481,Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!
00:28:53.565,00:28:54.899,Why would you do that?
00:29:08.830,00:29:11.166,11 o'clock. 12 o'clock. 11 o'clock. 12 o'clock.
00:29:11.249,00:29:12.125,"Come on, it's fun."
00:29:13.251,00:29:15.795,"If you think about it, it's time travel."
00:29:31.478,00:29:34.564,"You gonna draw me like one of your French girls, Jack?"
00:29:35.774,00:29:37.901,I'm joking.
00:29:37.984,00:29:40.111,"I'm sorry. Just don't make me look fat, OK?"
00:29:40.195,00:29:42.322,Earth's gravity adds ten pounds.
00:29:42.405,00:29:44.783,"Paul, could I ask you a question?"
00:29:44.866,00:29:45.909,Shoot.
00:29:45.992,00:29:49.329,"Um, have you ever done that to a person?"
00:29:49.412,00:29:50.955,Yes. I've eaten many people.
00:29:51.039,00:29:53.792,"I'm jokin', big guy. Relax."
00:29:53.875,00:29:55.710,"No, I mean, you know, fixed them?"
00:29:55.794,00:29:59.506,"Oh. No, not a dead person. Recently dead bird, that's one thing."
00:29:59.589,00:30:01.674,"Dead person, whole other ball game."
00:30:01.758,00:30:03.426,It's actually really dangerous for me.
00:30:03.510,00:30:09.849,"The damage can actually bounce back onto me-- Sorry, am I boring you? Have you heard this one before?"
00:30:09.933,00:30:11.184,"Are you tired, sausage?"
00:30:12.227,00:30:14.521,Don't call me that in front of him.
00:30:14.604,00:30:15.980,"Are you tired, though?"
00:30:16.064,00:30:18.441,"Eggy, I'm bushed."
00:30:20.652,00:30:22.821,"Let's pull over and stop for the night, huh?"
00:30:22.904,00:30:23.988,"We are fugitives, Paul."
00:30:24.072,00:30:27.951,I refuse to just sit around and wait to get fingered by the Men In Black.
00:30:30.495,00:30:32.455,We won't draw attention to ourselves.
00:30:34.624,00:30:36.793,"Oh, you'll know it when you see it."
00:30:40.380,00:30:41.923,Strange white guys. Got it.
00:30:42.006,00:30:44.342,-Order anything weird? -Chocolate milk.
00:30:44.425,00:30:47.053,-Chocolate. -Chocolate.
00:30:50.557,00:30:52.934,We've tracked them to a gas station in Ely.
00:30:53.017,00:30:56.020,We think he may be traveling in an RV with two men from England.
00:30:59.357,00:31:02.277,"Creepy. What are they, MI6?"
00:31:02.360,00:31:06.030,Negative. Just a couple of nerds on the lam from Comic-Con.
00:31:06.114,00:31:09.993,Something doesn't feel right. I think he had help on the inside.
00:31:13.204,00:31:19.252,"I want those nerds iced and that little green prick either back in his fishbowl or dead, ASAP."
00:31:38.813,00:31:40.481,Awfully quiet.
00:31:40.565,00:31:44.611,"Quiet's good, Graeme. Quiet's our friend."
00:31:48.573,00:31:49.657,There's a girl outside.
00:31:50.950,00:31:53.494,Um... OK.
00:31:53.578,00:31:55.121,"All right, look."
00:31:55.204,00:32:00.710,We're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the less touristy side of the American Midwest.
00:32:00.793,00:32:02.378,I don't think she heard you.
00:32:03.463,00:32:06.215,-I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you. -Oh. Sorry.
00:32:06.299,00:32:09.761,Hi. I'm Ruth Buggs.
00:32:09.844,00:32:14.098,"Good evening, Ruth. I am the writer Clive Gollings."
00:32:14.182,00:32:17.101,This is my friend and cohort Mr Graeme Willy.
00:32:17.185,00:32:18.102,Hi.
00:32:24.400,00:32:26.861,Sure. Yeah. Park in Bay 9.
00:32:26.945,00:32:29.155,"It's $25 a night, including hook-ups."
00:32:29.238,00:32:31.115,And I'll need an ID to hold on to.
00:32:31.199,00:32:32.200,OK.
00:32:42.001,00:32:44.837,Oh. The UK. I love the UK.
00:32:47.048,00:32:48.091,You should go.
00:32:48.174,00:32:50.468,Oh. OK.
00:32:50.551,00:32:52.637,"No, no. I meant you should go to London."
00:32:58.267,00:33:00.979,"Well, I'll be by in the morning to get your money."
00:33:01.062,00:33:02.939,"So, have a pleasant evening now, won't you?"
00:33:10.154,00:33:11.364,She was lovely.
00:33:12.865,00:33:14.450,Why don't you just marry her then?
00:33:15.159,00:33:15.994,-Boo! -Hey!
00:33:27.296,00:33:28.965,"I was just talking, Papa."
00:33:29.048,00:33:30.925,You talk too much.
00:33:32.051,00:33:33.761,"Sorry, Papa."
00:33:41.978,00:33:42.979,Hello.
00:33:44.731,00:33:47.316,"-You want a cigarette? -No, thanks. I don't smoke."
00:33:50.737,00:33:53.197,"-Can I ask you something? -Yeah, sure."
00:33:53.281,00:33:55.575,"You and Graeme, are you guys...?"
00:33:55.658,00:33:56.743,What?
00:34:02.415,00:34:05.501,"You know. You guys, two guys."
00:34:11.215,00:34:12.842,Fuckin' kidding me?
00:34:27.940,00:34:29.650,-I don't know what you mean. -Gay.
00:34:29.734,00:34:32.904,No! Why do people keep saying that?
00:34:32.987,00:34:34.238,"Nah, I was just wondering."
00:34:34.322,00:34:35.907,Totally cool if you are.
00:34:35.990,00:34:37.825,Everyone's bi on my planet.
00:34:37.909,00:34:40.787,It's all about the pleasure thang. Know what I'm sayin'?
00:34:40.870,00:34:42.997,"Why are you here, Paul?"
00:34:43.081,00:34:52.965,"Oh, I was here on a science mission, actually, and then I had some spaceship-related problems, and I kind of... crashed."
00:34:53.049,00:34:56.511,"Lucky for me, though, this little girl, she pulls me out of the wreck."
00:34:56.594,00:34:59.263,"Next thing I know, guys arrive, cart me off to the base."
00:35:01.057,00:35:02.934,What have you been doing here all this time?
00:35:03.017,00:35:06.813,"You know. I've been kickin' back, man. I've been shootin' shit."
00:35:06.896,00:35:10.191,-I've been advising the government. -Not just the government.
00:35:14.529,00:35:16.239,Something messianic.
00:35:20.451,00:35:21.786,Yeah! I don't know what that is.
00:35:21.869,00:35:26.499,Oh. Restoration of damaged tissue through telepathic manipulation of intrinsic field memory.
00:35:26.582,00:35:29.252,"-What's that mean? -It means healing, Mr Spielberg."
00:35:29.335,00:35:30.670,"-Yeah, right. Healing. -OK?"
00:35:30.753,00:35:32.713,Like by touch or something like that.
00:35:32.797,00:35:35.591,Maybe his finger lights up on the end when he reaches out and touches?
00:35:35.675,00:35:37.927,"Maybe. You know, sometimes I find less is more."
00:35:38.010,00:35:40.471,"Hey, trust me."
00:35:40.555,00:35:44.433,You'd be surprised how much he's influenced popular culture over the last 60 years.
00:35:44.517,00:35:46.227,Agent Mulder was right.
00:35:46.310,00:35:48.563,Agent Mulder was my idea!
00:35:48.646,00:35:50.398,-Really? Wow. -Yeah!
00:35:50.481,00:35:51.649,That's cool.
00:35:51.732,00:35:55.319,"Ooh. Pump that shit, Earthman. I like this song. Mmm!"
00:35:55.403,00:35:56.696,Marvin's my boy.
00:35:58.698,00:35:59.657,Come on.
00:35:59.740,00:36:03.035,"Break it down a bit, boys. Don't be afraid."
00:36:04.370,00:36:06.789,"Yeah, look at me. I'm breakin' it down."
00:36:09.750,00:36:11.752,Use them tongs.
00:36:11.836,00:36:13.963,Dance with those tongs.
00:36:14.046,00:36:15.131,Stoke the fire.
00:36:17.133,00:36:19.427,Ooh! Whoo! Yes.
00:36:22.722,00:36:24.182,Yee-haw!
00:36:56.923,00:36:59.425,Who's knocking? Stop it.
00:36:59.508,00:37:01.636,"-What are you doing? -Oh, shut up."
00:37:05.223,00:37:07.058,I'll hide in here.
00:37:07.141,00:37:09.101,-Don't come out. -Why would I come out?
00:37:09.185,00:37:10.686,-Who is it? -It's Ruth.
00:37:10.770,00:37:12.605,-Ooh. -Don't you dare... open that door.
00:37:14.815,00:37:17.026,"Good morning. Um, may I come in?"
00:37:17.109,00:37:20.863,"-Come in. Make yourself at home. -No, I don't think you should come in."
00:37:20.947,00:37:23.616,-We're not really dressed. -Sure. In you come.
00:37:24.367,00:37:25.910,"Uh, so where's the other one?"
00:37:25.993,00:37:28.496,The other one? It's just...
00:37:28.579,00:37:30.748,"Oh. Oh, it's OK. We don't charge by the person."
00:37:30.831,00:37:34.710,"There were three shadows I saw dancing around the RV last night, right?"
00:37:34.794,00:37:37.213,-Oh. -The other one. The other one.
00:37:44.470,00:37:49.058,"-That's a nice T-shirt. -Oh, thanks. I got it at my church."
00:37:49.141,00:37:51.435,It's Jesus shooting Charles Darwin.
00:37:51.519,00:37:54.397,Why would Jesus want to shoot Charles Darwin?
00:37:54.480,00:37:56.732,Because of his blasphemous theories.
00:37:57.775,00:37:58.901,Are you men of God?
00:38:02.905,00:38:05.908,"We're men of science, you know."
00:38:05.992,00:38:12.039,We believe in the establishment of a biological order through the maelstrom of physical and chemical chaos.
00:38:12.123,00:38:16.752,"The world is 4,000 years old and can only be the product of intelligent design."
00:38:18.504,00:38:27.221,"Oh! Um, all right. Well, then please explain how something as complex as the human eye simply just comes into being."
00:38:29.140,00:38:32.893,It is the culmination of billions of years of development across countless species!
00:38:39.317,00:38:46.824,Nothing that you can say can shake my belief or faith in the sure and certain knowledge that God made heaven and Earth and created us all in his own image.
00:38:50.745,00:38:52.997,How do you explain me?
00:38:58.002,00:38:59.962,And that's Jenga.
00:39:01.088,00:39:02.506,Why did you do that?
00:39:02.590,00:39:04.467,She fainted. We've gone through this.
00:39:04.550,00:39:06.552,But we're gonna have to take her with us now.
00:39:06.635,00:39:08.137,No. No.
00:39:08.220,00:39:11.932,This is America. Kidnapping a Christian? That's worse than harboring a fugitive.
00:39:12.016,00:39:15.144,"But she's seen you. If we leave her, then she's gonna call the police."
00:39:15.227,00:39:18.230,Who gives a shit? No-one's gonna believe this God-bothering cyclops.
00:39:18.314,00:39:20.733,Let's just dump her on the road. Just roll her up in the rug.
00:39:22.109,00:39:24.236,"If we take her with us, we can get her on our side."
00:39:24.320,00:39:26.739,"Yeah, and you'd love to get her on our side, wouldn't you?"
00:39:26.822,00:39:27.990,That doesn't make sense.
00:39:28.074,00:39:30.451,"Look, she'll be fine. We're quite nice."
00:39:30.534,00:39:32.578,All right. What about my passport?
00:39:34.080,00:39:36.123,"Oh, God. You guys."
00:39:43.923,00:39:45.883,Mmm? Mm-mm.
00:39:47.676,00:39:49.053,Mmm.
00:39:50.805,00:39:53.224,Mmm. Hmm.
00:40:02.316,00:40:05.361,Ruth? What in the Lord's name...?
00:40:05.444,00:40:06.695,Morning.
00:40:12.827,00:40:14.078,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
00:40:26.132,00:40:27.174,Jump! Jump!
00:40:32.680,00:40:34.932,-What? That's actually small on my planet.
00:40:58.789,00:41:01.125,"Hello, Ruth. Um, would you like a cup of tea?"
00:41:03.002,00:41:04.336,Where am I?
00:41:06.338,00:41:07.590,"Hey, look who's awake."
00:41:07.673,00:41:09.842,Demon! Demon!
00:41:09.925,00:41:12.636,We're sorry. OK? We're sorry. We're not gonna hurt you. I promise.
00:41:12.720,00:41:14.680,We'll let you go just as soon as we can.
00:41:14.763,00:41:17.308,You've been deceived by an agent of Satan himself!
00:41:17.391,00:41:19.310,-He's evil! -I'm sitting right here. Come on.
00:41:19.393,00:41:21.812,"No, he's not... He's not evil. He's just a bit rude."
00:41:21.896,00:41:24.815,"You know, we're trying to help him get home. He's from another world."
00:41:24.899,00:41:26.901,"There's only one world, our world."
00:41:26.984,00:41:28.903,The world that our God the Father created.
00:41:28.986,00:41:36.035,"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, my existence only disproves traditional notions of the Abrahamic, Judeo-Christian God, as well as all one-world theologies."
00:41:36.118,00:41:37.036,That's all I meant.
00:41:40.372,00:41:41.999,You can't win with these people.
00:41:43.083,00:41:49.465,"Ruth, just listen to me for one second. Please, if you could just calm down-- I can't drive like this."
00:42:08.859,00:42:10.277,What did you do to her?
00:42:10.361,00:42:14.865,I just transferred my collective knowledge and experience via a tactile psychokinetic bridge.
00:42:14.949,00:42:17.743,-Wow! Could you do me? -It really takes it out of me.
00:42:24.750,00:42:26.544,"Oh, yeah."
00:42:26.627,00:42:30.172,He always knew what was going on in Battlestar before me cos his mum had cable.
00:42:30.256,00:42:32.132,"All right, pull over. I'll do you."
00:42:32.216,00:42:34.176,Absolutely not. No spoilers.
00:42:39.640,00:42:42.518,"This is not the police's area of expertise, Mr Buggs."
00:42:42.601,00:42:44.770,That devil took my daughter.
00:42:44.853,00:42:46.522,What do you mean devil?
00:42:46.605,00:42:48.899,"And your daughter's name is Ruth, is it?"
00:42:48.983,00:42:50.025,That's right.
00:42:50.109,00:42:52.611,I brought her up by myself after her mama died.
00:42:55.030,00:42:56.407,She's pretty easy to spot.
00:42:56.490,00:42:59.451,She's had this eye thing since she was four years old.
00:42:59.535,00:43:04.123,Do you have a phone here that your daughter might try to reach you at if she decides to call?
00:43:04.206,00:43:05.124,In the back.
00:43:05.207,00:43:09.336,"Hey, Peter Parker, wanna put the snappy down and get to the phone?"
00:43:18.470,00:43:20.097,if they ain't on the interstate.
00:43:27.605,00:43:30.608,Sir? Mind telling us what we're looking for?
00:43:30.691,00:43:31.859,"Yeah, what are we looking for?"
00:43:31.942,00:43:34.111,"I told you, this is a need to know operation."
00:43:34.194,00:43:36.322,"Yes, sir, but..."
00:43:38.407,00:43:40.034,Dammit.
00:43:46.790,00:43:50.294,Now let's go find that crazy old bastard's little girl before it's too late.
00:43:57.384,00:44:01.513,"-Ruth! Ruth, wait! -Leave me alone!"
00:44:01.597,00:44:03.515,Please. Please stop. I've got shin splints.
00:44:06.894,00:44:09.563,He cannot be from space. It's not possible.
00:44:09.647,00:44:11.523,OK? He's from somewhere else.
00:44:11.607,00:44:14.610,"Look, Ruth, you saw it for yourself, OK? He showed you."
00:44:14.693,00:44:17.821,There's probably billions of intelligent civilizations out there.
00:44:17.905,00:44:19.573,So where is everybody? Hmm?
00:44:19.657,00:44:21.367,"I... Well, one of them's there."
00:44:23.911,00:44:25.579,Are they looking right now?
00:44:28.499,00:44:30.542,That's pathetic.
00:44:32.711,00:44:35.130,"What's your beef, Clive?"
00:44:35.214,00:44:36.298,I don't have beef.
00:44:38.717,00:44:42.429,I'm from outer space. You're a science fiction writer.
00:44:42.513,00:44:44.098,We should be best buds.
00:44:44.181,00:44:48.727,It's not you. It's me.
00:44:53.357,00:44:56.193,Is that what this is? You're jealous of her?
00:44:58.195,00:44:59.196,It's not just that.
00:45:00.739,00:45:03.617,Whoa. Of me?
00:45:04.618,00:45:08.831,"Oh, my... This is because me and Graeme got, like, two minutes of face time while you were sleeping?"
00:45:08.914,00:45:11.708,"-Is that what this is? -I wanted this to be special, you know."
00:45:11.792,00:45:17.214,I have dreamt about meeting you... ever since I saw Mac and Me.
00:45:17.297,00:45:18.966,And I blew it.
00:45:19.049,00:45:22.302,"Now you two are friendly, and he's off talking to girls."
00:45:22.386,00:45:24.221,"And it's like, where am I?"
00:45:24.304,00:45:26.306,"Come on, man."
00:45:26.390,00:45:28.517,This is special.
00:45:28.600,00:45:31.061,You guys being all nerdy and shit and meeting me?
00:45:31.145,00:45:32.729,"I mean, that is fate."
00:45:32.813,00:45:36.066,"Who cares if you pissed your pants, man?"
00:45:36.150,00:45:39.820,"When I first got here, first time I saw a human, I puked."
00:45:41.155,00:45:42.906,You guys are weird-looking.
00:45:42.990,00:45:45.784,You have giant bodies. You have tiny little... tiny heads.
00:45:49.746,00:45:51.415,"Look, you want a little sugar?"
00:45:53.792,00:45:55.544,"It's just knowledge and experience, man."
00:45:55.627,00:45:57.713,You're a writer. It might give you some inspiration.
00:45:57.796,00:45:59.756,Will it hurt?
00:45:59.840,00:46:02.092,Only if you struggle.
00:46:02.176,00:46:04.052,All right.
00:46:09.850,00:46:14.146,"So there's no heaven, no hell? No right, no wrong?"
00:46:14.229,00:46:15.647,No sin?
00:46:15.731,00:46:17.524,Well...
00:46:17.608,00:46:19.818,-I can drink? -If you like.
00:46:19.902,00:46:22.321,-I can fornicate? -Maybe.
00:46:22.404,00:46:24.573,"-I can curse? -Well, yeah."
00:46:24.656,00:46:26.074,-Penises! -Ruth.
00:46:26.158,00:46:28.243,Assing! Hairy boobs! Poop!
00:46:28.327,00:46:29.995,Farting butt holes!
00:46:30.078,00:46:31.497,"Ruth, I'm not sure this is helping."
00:46:32.664,00:46:34.249,What are you doing?
00:46:35.417,00:46:37.252,Why? Why? Why should I stop?
00:46:40.464,00:46:41.548,This is not...
00:46:43.258,00:46:53.477,"Because you have your whole life to explore new things, OK, doesn't necessarily mean you should be exploring mine right now."
00:46:55.979,00:46:58.815,"Look, you said you wanted to travel, all right?"
00:46:58.899,00:47:00.984,"To see, like, new stuff? This is your chance."
00:47:01.068,00:47:03.695,I really think you should come with us.
00:47:04.780,00:47:06.073,Where would I sleep?
00:47:06.156,00:47:09.159,"Oh, I'll sleep on the sofa, and then you can have my bed."
00:47:09.243,00:47:12.037,You know? But I'd push the tissues off with a pen if I were you.
00:47:12.120,00:47:12.996,Because I've had a cold.
00:47:13.080,00:47:14.623,Oh.
00:47:20.337,00:47:23.840,Ruth has decided that she would like to come with us.
00:47:28.011,00:47:29.596,I'm gonna go freshen up.
00:47:33.141,00:47:34.935,You don't smoke.
00:47:35.018,00:47:37.062,I just wanted to say thanks.
00:47:37.145,00:47:42.192,"I know this has been weird for you, but you saved my life and I owe you one, OK?"
00:47:44.695,00:47:47.573,"What do you got there, by the way?"
00:47:47.656,00:47:52.035,Severe epiretinal membrane complicated by macular edema in your left vitreous cavity?
00:47:52.119,00:47:53.370,How did you know that?
00:47:53.453,00:47:54.871,Lucky guess.
00:47:54.955,00:47:57.416,Do you mind if I take a look at it for one second?
00:48:03.046,00:48:06.091,What does it say in the Old Testament? An eye for an eye?
00:48:07.342,00:48:10.304,-Wait. I don't-- -It's OK. You can trust me.
00:48:10.387,00:48:13.265,"-I don't know. -Just have a little faith, OK?"
00:48:42.252,00:48:43.920,How did you do that?
00:48:45.088,00:48:46.590,"Evolution, baby."
00:48:54.264,00:48:55.807,"-Um, Graeme? -Yeah."
00:48:58.268,00:49:00.562,"-Oh, my God. Clive."
00:49:20.457,00:49:22.584,What are you gonna do? Make your move.
00:49:22.668,00:49:24.169,"Make... Oh, shit. Damnit."
00:49:54.241,00:49:57.828,Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.
00:50:01.581,00:50:04.251,Huh? This is easy.
00:50:06.420,00:50:08.880,"Small corrections, Paul. Just make small corrections."
00:50:22.978,00:50:24.980,"Hey there, sleepy face."
00:50:25.063,00:50:28.608,Fuckeroo. That was the best titty-farting sleep I have ever had.
00:50:28.692,00:50:33.029,"Uh, I got a feeling that you're new to cursing, Ruth."
00:50:33.113,00:50:36.241,"Look, cursing's fun. You just gotta pick your moments, OK?"
00:50:36.324,00:50:39.870,"Hey, maybe we should stop for some food. Is anybody hungry?"
00:50:39.953,00:50:41.163,"-Fuck, yeah. -Ruth?"
00:50:41.246,00:50:43.790,"You bet your big, fat cock I am."
00:50:43.874,00:50:45.041,Nice.
00:50:46.710,00:50:48.503,"What's new, fatty?"
00:50:52.549,00:50:53.675,-So rude. -You're rude.
00:50:53.759,00:50:55.969,-Maybe I should call my dad. -What?
00:50:56.052,00:50:58.138,-What? Why? -I've been gone for a whole day.
00:50:58.221,00:51:00.432,"If he calls the police, they're gonna be looking for us."
00:51:00.515,00:51:04.144,"If I don't, there's a good chance we could all end up in Shit-Butt City."
00:51:04.227,00:51:05.937,You're really getting the hang of this.
00:51:06.021,00:51:08.565,"-Thanks, dick milk. -Eh."
00:51:39.304,00:51:41.807,-I won't be long. -OK. Be careful.
00:52:00.951,00:52:03.620,Listen to me carefully. I want you to tell me where you are.
00:52:04.246,00:52:05.247,Who is this?
00:52:05.330,00:52:11.336,"My name is Agent Zoil, and it's very important that you tell me where you are and where you are headed, Ms Buggs."
00:52:11.419,00:52:16.132,"I... I can't tell you. I mean, I don't know."
00:52:16.216,00:52:17.592,You've been abducted.
00:52:17.676,00:52:20.720,And the individual that you're traveling with is highly dangerous.
00:52:22.722,00:52:25.433,"I mean, he's kind of rude. He curses a lot."
00:52:25.517,00:52:29.104,And a couple times I've seen him scratch his spaceman balls.
00:52:31.439,00:52:32.816,Please listen to me.
00:52:32.899,00:52:36.778,"Your father is extremely worried about you, and we'd like to get you home, Ms Buggs."
00:52:36.862,00:52:39.155,He showed me things.
00:52:39.239,00:52:41.408,She's talking about his spaceman balls. Agh!
00:52:41.491,00:52:43.201,"You know I'm trying to help you, right, Ruth?"
00:52:43.285,00:52:46.371,I just... I don't know what's real any more. I'm confused.
00:52:46.454,00:52:48.748,"-We got the bitch! -Yeah, dawg! Up high!"
00:52:54.129,00:52:55.630,"-Hey! -Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:52:55.714,00:52:59.301,"-Slow down there, baby. -Excuse me, I have to get to my friends."
00:52:59.384,00:53:03.013,What's the rush? I got a friend down here that'd love to meet you.
00:53:07.809,00:53:09.644,-How's your dad? -We gotta go. We gotta go.
00:53:09.728,00:53:11.438,-What about the mini pizzas? -We gotta go!
00:53:11.521,00:53:14.107,"-No, you don't! -Holy shit!"
00:53:14.190,00:53:18.111,It's the space faggots that dinged the fuck-mobile!
00:53:18.194,00:53:19.905,-We were just leaving. I don't feel well.
00:53:19.988,00:53:21.281,-I don't think so! -Leave her alone!
00:53:22.908,00:53:24.576,"Oh, shit! Sailors!"
00:53:24.659,00:53:26.328,-Let's go! -Sorry!
00:53:26.411,00:53:27.537,-Ooh! -Oh.
00:53:27.621,00:53:28.997,"-Excuse me, miss. -Oh!"
00:53:30.206,00:53:31.499,-Papa?
00:53:34.085,00:53:36.504,Ruth? My Lord! Your eye!
00:53:38.006,00:53:40.050,-Come on. Let's go! -But what about my dad?
00:53:40.133,00:53:41.593,Let's go!
00:53:48.224,00:53:50.310,"Leave us alone, you stupid vaginas!"
00:53:50.393,00:53:53.355,That's no way for a pretty little thing like you to talk!
00:53:53.438,00:53:56.816,"-She's fairly new to it, to be honest. -Leave this to me. I'll talk to them."
00:54:02.906,00:54:04.699,"Yo, fucknuts!"
00:54:04.783,00:54:06.576,It's probing time.
00:54:06.660,00:54:09.454,-Oh.
00:54:13.458,00:54:15.502,"Oh, shit! The Five-O! Let's bounce."
00:54:15.585,00:54:17.879,I'm sorry. They answered the phone.
00:54:21.174,00:54:22.842,Get in the RV.
00:54:22.926,00:54:24.970,-Come on! They're gonna wake up! -Hurry!
00:54:34.270,00:54:35.605,Shouldn't we keep moving?
00:54:35.689,00:54:39.359,No. That is exactly what they'll expect us to do. Trust me.
00:54:39.442,00:54:41.820,Only an idiot would stop right now.
00:55:00.505,00:55:01.673,What should we do now?
00:55:02.674,00:55:04.384,"Well, how about a hot chocolate in bed?"
00:55:04.467,00:55:05.802,"What are you, my grandma?"
00:55:05.885,00:55:08.847,I couldn't sleep. I'm too pumped.
00:55:08.930,00:55:11.391,"Yeah, me too. Let's get some beers, find somewhere to chill."
00:55:11.474,00:55:12.350,What do you say?
00:55:12.434,00:55:14.352,What if someone sees you?
00:55:22.819,00:55:25.488,"Well, I'm a little bit tired."
00:55:26.781,00:55:30.368,Don't call me a pussy. All right.
00:55:32.412,00:55:35.248,I might bruise. Get your hands off me!
00:55:44.299,00:55:45.550,Hoss?
00:55:46.843,00:55:48.553,Something I can help you with?
00:55:48.636,00:55:50.847,Yeah. You mind telling me what happened here?
00:55:50.930,00:55:54.434,Just a good old-fashioned beer-soaked slobber-knocker.
00:55:54.517,00:55:55.977,See anything unusual?
00:55:56.061,00:56:01.149,A couple hillbilly types in the back of that meat wagon won't stop crying.
00:56:06.237,00:56:09.157,Have you gentlemen seen anything unusual this evening?
00:56:10.867,00:56:11.826,Mm-mm.
00:56:18.333,00:56:19.375,-Thank you. -No sweat.
00:56:37.685,00:56:40.730,-I'll tell you what else is funny. -Mmm.
00:56:40.814,00:56:42.857,Was when you kissed me yesterday.
00:56:44.526,00:56:46.778,-No. It's not... -Oh.
00:56:46.861,00:56:49.072,"I was, like, Get off me, you rapist."
00:56:53.576,00:56:55.745,"-Do it again, if you like. -What?"
00:56:56.830,00:56:58.414,"I said you can do it again, if you like."
00:56:59.958,00:57:01.626,Really?
00:57:01.709,00:57:08.716,"If you're gonna try it, maybe you should do it with a friend, you know, rather than someone like a stranger, because, you know, there's a lot of weirdos out there."
00:57:08.800,00:57:14.347,"Well, I am planning on doing a lot of kissing and fornicating, so you'd really be helping me out."
00:57:14.430,00:57:16.266,-Great.
00:57:18.184,00:57:20.687,"-I thought you meant... -No, I did. No, let's do it now."
00:57:20.770,00:57:22.897,"-I mean... -Yeah. Right. Well, um..."
00:57:22.981,00:57:24.441,Put my hands on you.
00:57:24.524,00:57:26.317,Just stand here? OK.
00:57:26.401,00:57:28.069,Hold you steady.
00:57:33.867,00:57:37.871,I'm sorry. I thought I was gonna pass out. Carry on.
00:57:37.954,00:57:38.997,What's happening?
00:57:39.080,00:57:41.332,Nothing. Nothing. Just hanging around.
00:57:41.416,00:57:43.001,They were about to make out.
00:57:43.084,00:57:44.794,It was awkward.
00:57:44.878,00:57:46.296,We were just...
00:57:48.339,00:57:51.384,"Good. Please put your shorts on, Paul."
00:58:00.477,00:58:01.603,I'll partake.
00:58:04.481,00:58:07.108,"It's pretty strong shit. I got it from the military, actually."
00:58:07.192,00:58:09.569,-This is the stuff that killed Dylan. -Bob Dylan's not dead.
00:58:10.612,00:58:11.529,Isn't he?
00:58:13.364,00:58:14.616,Hit me.
00:58:14.699,00:58:17.702,"OK. Just, you know, go easy on it."
00:58:17.785,00:58:19.037,Ruth.
00:58:32.091,00:58:45.772,"I... To be fair, it takes a while to be absorbed into-- We should cook up some sausages. Do we have any sausages?"
00:58:45.855,00:58:47.732,-Uh... -What do you mean by that?
00:58:47.815,00:58:49.317,-No. -Why do you guys hate me?
00:58:49.400,00:58:51.569,Can we cook up some sausages?
00:58:51.653,00:58:54.072,"Ooh, I have wasps in my brain!"
00:58:56.741,00:58:59.369,She'll be fine. That happened to me the first time.
00:59:01.287,00:59:02.330,Paul.
00:59:03.623,00:59:06.251,"I always wanted to ask. We... You know us now, right?"
00:59:06.334,00:59:09.712,"Yeah. I mean, Graeme, we're, like, bona fide BFFs."
00:59:11.631,00:59:13.925,Why are you in such a hurry to leave now?
00:59:16.469,00:59:21.057,"Well, according to the government, I've fulfilled my usefulness."
00:59:21.140,00:59:22.767,I told them everything I know.
00:59:22.850,00:59:30.400,"The only thing I have left to offer them now are my abilities, the healing, the thought transfer, the camouflage."
00:59:30.483,00:59:33.987,"In order to cultivate those abilities, they need some of my stem cells."
00:59:34.070,00:59:36.281,And I'm not really down with that.
00:59:36.364,00:59:39.534,"Lucky for me, I do have one friend left on the inside."
00:59:39.617,00:59:41.869,So I managed to get an SOS beamed into space.
00:59:41.953,00:59:44.872,I got my people primed and ready to pick me up.
00:59:44.956,00:59:47.917,Then motherfuckers brought the procedure forward by a day.
00:59:48.001,00:59:50.587,-My whole plan goes to shit. -What happened?
00:59:50.670,00:59:54.173,"On the way to the medi-labs, I zapped my escort, I stole his car, I took off."
00:59:55.174,00:59:56.551,Found you guys.
00:59:56.634,00:59:58.970,So what happens if you get caught?
00:59:59.053,01:00:02.390,"Graeme, they're gonna cut out my brain."
01:00:03.433,01:00:04.434,Oh.
01:00:07.854,01:00:09.939,It's kind of a buzzkill.
01:00:10.023,01:00:13.067,"Let's lighten the mood, shall we? Clive, when did you last get laid?"
01:00:17.196,01:00:20.992,"-Uh, Collectormania, London, '08. - '08."
01:00:21.075,01:00:22.410,Ewok chick.
01:00:27.165,01:00:30.168,"No, but seriously, be honest with me."
01:00:30.251,01:00:31.336,What was it like?
01:00:31.419,01:00:35.048,"Well, she was furry nice."
01:00:37.508,01:00:39.427,"Oh, that's gross."
01:00:46.601,01:00:49.062,"No, Boomer. It's forbidden."
01:00:49.145,01:00:50.605,"Hey, Clive."
01:00:51.564,01:00:52.940,-Hey! -Clive!
01:01:01.574,01:01:02.700,Where's Ruth?
01:01:03.660,01:01:06.079,She went back to the RV.
01:01:24.013,01:01:26.724,I can't hold my breath the whole way through town.
01:01:28.101,01:01:29.310,Wait here.
01:01:43.950,01:01:45.952,"Morning. Agent Zoil, Secret Service."
01:01:46.035,01:01:48.121,You mind if I come in there and ask a few questions?
01:01:48.204,01:01:49.372,Not at all.
01:01:56.254,01:01:57.088,Morning.
01:02:01.718,01:02:04.387,-Why are we holding hands? -So we look like a family.
01:02:04.470,01:02:06.264,"Yeah, the fucking Friedmans."
01:02:06.347,01:02:08.725,-You could be a midget. -You're obsessed with midgets!
01:02:08.808,01:02:09.600,"No, I'm not!"
01:02:12.103,01:02:17.734,"OK. We're just a couple of regular guys, walking down the street with a small cowboy, all right, Clive?"
01:02:17.817,01:02:19.193,Clive?
01:02:19.277,01:02:21.195,"Clive. Oh, come on!"
01:02:27.076,01:02:28.578,"Clive, what are you doing?"
01:02:28.661,01:02:31.164,"-Yeah, man. What the fuck? -I want it."
01:02:31.247,01:02:35.251,"I can appreciate it's a bargain, but this is not Comic-Con. This is reality."
01:02:35.334,01:02:36.627,It's a false economy anyway.
01:02:36.711,01:02:38.880,It'll break the first time you use it. Let's go!
01:02:38.963,01:02:41.132,"-Why would I ever use it? -Can we just go, please?"
01:02:41.215,01:02:43.301,Wait. Maybe we should go inside.
01:02:45.219,01:02:48.431,"You go back and get Ruth. Get the RV, pick us up in ten minutes."
01:02:48.514,01:02:49.432,You sure?
01:02:50.892,01:02:52.143,Trust me.
01:02:58.107,01:03:00.610,"Morning. My name is Agent Zoil, Secret Service."
01:03:00.693,01:03:02.612,"You mind if I come in, ask you a few questions?"
01:03:02.695,01:03:06.032,-Do you mind if we just do it right here? -OK.
01:03:06.115,01:03:09.160,It's just this place is a real cock-suckin' mess.
01:03:10.495,01:03:11.329,Got it.
01:03:12.789,01:03:16.626,I'm telling you. We're looking for a goddamn alien.
01:03:16.709,01:03:18.961,I thought all that Project Blue Book stuff was horseshit.
01:03:19.045,01:03:22.131,"No, it all makes sense. I mean, all this hush-hush crap?"
01:03:22.215,01:03:23.925,-The drawing that I found? -Mm-hm.
01:03:24.008,01:03:26.385,What do you think that girl was talking about last night?
01:03:26.469,01:03:29.180,-Holy shit! Spaceman balls! -Yeah.
01:03:29.263,01:03:31.015,And who has spaceman balls?
01:03:31.098,01:03:33.100,-Buzz Aldrin? -Be serious.
01:03:42.902,01:03:44.654,"Hello, handsome."
01:03:46.614,01:03:48.366,Uh... Huh?
01:03:48.449,01:03:49.659,Is that you on the cover?
01:03:53.037,01:03:55.623,-What's your name? -Keith Nash.
01:03:55.706,01:03:58.960,-Nice to meet you. I'm Paul. -Right.
01:03:59.043,01:04:01.587,"So uh, you're not freaked out by me?"
01:04:01.671,01:04:04.465,-Mmm. Yes and no. -Huh.
01:04:04.549,01:04:11.180,"You mind taking a look at these photographs, tell me if you recognize either one of these two gentlemen or the one-eyed girl?"
01:04:11.264,01:04:13.474,-Ma'am? -No.
01:04:13.558,01:04:15.601,Anything? Anything at all?
01:04:15.685,01:04:17.395,Mm-mm.
01:04:17.478,01:04:20.064,-You really think this is an alien? -Yeah.
01:04:20.147,01:04:23.901,-This is huge. -I know. I know.
01:04:23.985,01:04:27.405,Is that a comic book shop? Can we go in there?
01:04:27.488,01:04:29.991,Maybe. If you're good.
01:04:30.074,01:04:32.869,"-Thanks for your time, Mrs... -Darwin."
01:04:34.370,01:04:36.122,Charlotte Darwin.
01:04:36.205,01:04:40.167,-Charlotte Darwin. You have a great day. -Thanks.
01:04:42.879,01:04:44.589,You should get this one.
01:04:46.048,01:04:47.633,"-Thanks. -Yeah, it's good."
01:04:49.135,01:04:51.971,"Nice! Like your style, Keith Nash."
01:04:52.054,01:04:53.931,-I gotta go. -Catch you later.
01:04:54.015,01:04:56.726,"-Bye, Paul. -Don't get caught."
01:05:05.276,01:05:08.154,Huh! Pretty good.
01:05:08.237,01:05:10.239,Pretty good.
01:05:14.744,01:05:17.747,"With the sword, $299.99, plus tax."
01:05:17.830,01:05:19.373,"Uh, yeah. I'll wear it now."
01:05:23.711,01:05:25.671,I'll be right out.
01:05:27.423,01:05:29.258,Should use the cuff link thing.
01:05:48.235,01:05:50.404,Spaceman balls?
01:05:58.913,01:06:02.083,Get your goddamn hands off my motherfuckin' junk!
01:06:03.334,01:06:05.461,It's in there! It's in there!
01:06:16.597,01:06:17.473,Hello.
01:06:18.724,01:06:23.020,O'Reilly! You dumb shit. That's just some asshole... in a mask.
01:06:25.481,01:06:27.316,I gotta quit smokin'.
01:06:39.078,01:06:40.788,-Shit! -They're right behind me!
01:06:42.123,01:06:44.667,"-Hurry up, buttcracks! -Hey, look. It's that nerd."
01:06:44.750,01:06:46.335,Ohhhh!
01:06:46.419,01:06:49.672,-Oh-ho! Yeah! -Who was that kid?
01:06:49.755,01:06:51.590,Keith Nash. Punch it!
01:06:51.674,01:06:54.301,-Oh! Oh! Oh! -What happened? Who was that kid?
01:07:01.600,01:07:03.102,"-Get the car started! -Yes, sir!"
01:07:04.020,01:07:06.981,"Whoa, whoa. What's goin' on? Did you guys get me some information?"
01:07:07.064,01:07:08.190,We saw it. We saw the alien.
01:07:08.274,01:07:10.735,It was in the comic book shop. Hideous! I think I shit my pants.
01:07:10.818,01:07:13.362,I don't know what you guys are talking about.
01:07:13.446,01:07:14.864,OK. You know what?
01:07:14.947,01:07:18.159,You know exactly what we're talking about.
01:07:18.242,01:07:24.832,I'm sick and tired of being in the dark on this-- Hey. Where the fuck did he go?
01:07:24.915,01:07:27.626,I got your door for you. I got mine.
01:07:27.710,01:07:30.171,He went with those nerds.
01:07:30.254,01:07:34.175,"So, do... You want to follow us, big guy?"
01:07:34.258,01:07:36.302,-You kids are gonna go back to the base. -Uh-huh.
01:07:36.385,01:07:39.096,"Daddy's gonna stick behind, do a little adult work."
01:07:39.180,01:07:40.931,Now tell me which way the little green guy went.
01:07:41.015,01:07:43.768,North-North... Northeast Highway. Northeast Highway.
01:07:43.851,01:07:44.894,Straight home now.
01:07:51.192,01:07:53.986,This guy doesn't quit. You kind of have to respect it.
01:08:01.368,01:08:03.370,"-Oh, God, Graeme. Drive faster. -Go away, Dad!"
01:08:03.454,01:08:05.790,"-Clive, calm down. -Those asshorns are gonna catch us!"
01:08:05.873,01:08:08.375,"-I said calm down! Pull over! -What do you mean, pull over?"
01:08:08.459,01:08:09.877,Pull over!
01:08:28.479,01:08:31.065,All right. That's it. This is too dangerous.
01:08:31.148,01:08:33.109,I can make it on my own from here.
01:08:33.192,01:08:35.653,"-What do you mean? -No. Graeme, you've done enough."
01:08:35.736,01:08:38.322,I'll boost a car or something. I can drive an automatic.
01:08:38.405,01:08:39.824,You're a terrible driver.
01:08:39.907,01:08:42.076,"He's right, Paul. You can't even drive a spaceship."
01:08:42.159,01:08:44.870,I'm close now. I'll be fine.
01:08:44.954,01:08:47.748,"-But we've come all this way. -Yeah. And at what cost, huh?"
01:08:47.832,01:08:50.459,I've shaken your faith. I've almost gotten you guys killed.
01:08:51.418,01:08:52.294,I just want to get home.
01:08:52.378,01:08:54.046,You are going home.
01:08:54.130,01:08:56.465,I think we've come too far to let you do this alone.
01:08:56.549,01:08:57.967,Yeah. What happened to BFFs?
01:08:58.050,01:08:59.468,"We are in this together, Paul."
01:08:59.552,01:09:02.471,You bet your hairy love eggs we are.
01:09:02.555,01:09:07.184,"The last 72 hours have been the ride of my life, and I'm fucked if I'm getting off this bus now."
01:09:07.268,01:09:08.936,"-Yeah, me too. -And me."
01:09:09.019,01:09:10.563,"Well, that settles it."
01:09:10.646,01:09:12.523,We're all fucked.
01:09:14.316,01:09:16.277,Thank you guys so much.
01:09:16.360,01:09:20.447,"If you're absolutely sure, there is a little something you can do for me."
01:09:30.583,01:09:31.584,Hmm.
01:09:34.044,01:09:36.630,"-That wasn't difficult, was it? -No. Not at all."
01:09:37.631,01:09:39.300,-Hello. -Hello.
01:09:39.383,01:09:41.886,"That'll be $299.99, plus tax."
01:09:50.352,01:09:51.562,"Oh, shit. Can you drive this thing?"
01:10:09.163,01:10:13.292,A fireworks store just got ripped off by two British nerds in an RV.
01:10:13.375,01:10:14.543,Son of a bitch!
01:10:14.627,01:10:17.922,"According to local bacon, they're on the 14, 40 miles west of you."
01:10:18.005,01:10:20.257,"Drive like a man, you'll catch up to them in 30."
01:10:20.341,01:10:23.010,Cops are standing down. You better spin your ass around.
01:10:23.093,01:10:24.094,Roger that!
01:10:31.560,01:10:35.105,I'm guest of honor at the governor's ball tonight. I'm dressed up real nice.
01:10:35.189,01:10:37.316,Where the hell does this 14 go anyway?
01:10:37.399,01:10:38.484,You tell me.
01:10:38.567,01:10:41.820,I don't know. You got Thermopolis. You got Lytle Creek.
01:10:49.453,01:10:52.248,"He's gonna try and make contact. We got him, Zoil."
01:10:52.331,01:10:57.044,"Bring me back my space monkey, and I guarantee you level five clearance and all the perks."
01:10:59.588,01:11:02.132,"I don't know, man. I don't know. He looked awful mad."
01:11:02.216,01:11:04.635,Fuck him. He's a dinosaur.
01:11:04.718,01:11:06.262,It's time for some new blood.
01:11:14.728,01:11:17.606,-OK. We're nearly there. -This is where we've been heading?
01:11:17.690,01:11:20.192,"No. I just need to make a little stop first, OK?"
01:11:20.276,01:11:23.028,"Do you think we've really got time to be making little stops, Paul?"
01:11:23.112,01:11:25.239,This is something I really have to do.
01:11:28.075,01:11:29.118,This is close enough.
01:11:33.289,01:11:36.625,"-Well, shouldn't we park a bit closer? -No."
01:11:37.543,01:11:39.670,-We don't want to scare her. -Scare who?
01:11:44.675,01:11:45.592,I always knock.
01:11:47.678,01:11:50.556,Um... Is... Is that Tara Wilton?
01:11:55.060,01:11:57.688,"Ms Wilton, my name is Clive Gollings."
01:11:57.771,01:12:00.816,I'm here with my friend Mr Graeme Willy.
01:12:04.778,01:12:06.572,And what do you want?
01:12:07.906,01:12:12.745,We're here with the alien that killed your dog 60 years ago.
01:12:18.959,01:12:21.086,What is this? Some kind of a joke?
01:12:24.965,01:12:26.342,"Hey, Tara."
01:12:38.062,01:12:40.022,"That's a very loud clock, isn't it?"
01:12:40.105,01:12:44.485,You have a nerve showing your face here after all these years.
01:12:46.695,01:12:49.573,-Maybe I should make some tea. -I'll do it.
01:13:03.003,01:13:04.463,Hmm.
01:13:04.546,01:13:10.969,"Uh, look, Tara, I-- I only just stopped believing in you, you know."
01:13:11.053,01:13:16.225,I spent a very long time trying to convince folks about what happened that night.
01:13:16.308,01:13:18.727,Everyone said I was mad.
01:13:18.811,01:13:23.732,They told me it was a meteor that squashed little Paul.
01:13:23.816,01:13:26.693,"Said that I was concussed, hallucinating."
01:13:26.819,01:13:27.820,But I knew you were real.
01:13:27.903,01:13:31.990,I pulled you from that spaceship myself.
01:13:32.074,01:13:33.659,I kept you warm and comfortable.
01:13:33.742,01:13:37.329,I sat there with you till the men came to take you away.
01:13:38.705,01:13:46.046,"When word got out about my story, kids used to come and throw stones at the house, call me names."
01:13:47.548,01:13:49.925,And I just hid myself away.
01:13:52.886,01:13:56.515,"just staring at the sky, hoping that I'd catch a glimpse of you."
01:13:56.598,01:13:58.642,And here you are.
01:14:00.853,01:14:02.479,"I'm sorry, you know."
01:14:02.563,01:14:07.192,"If I could have done it any other way, I-- Oh, it's OK."
01:14:11.488,01:14:12.865,-I was right. -Mm-hm.
01:14:12.948,01:14:15.742,And all those folks that said I was crazy?
01:14:15.826,01:14:18.787,"Well, they can all just go fuck themselves."
01:14:20.581,01:14:24.543,I brought something for you. Thought you might want it back.
01:14:27.588,01:14:28.630,Here you go.
01:14:45.147,01:14:46.857,"Now, who do you suppose that is?"
01:14:49.526,01:14:52.279,-Where did that come from? -Holy shit! It's them!
01:14:56.950,01:14:59.119,What the fuck are you doing here?
01:15:21.266,01:15:24.186,"Shit! Haggard! Where's the party, man?"
01:15:24.269,01:15:26.438,"There's no-one in this place! Come on, buddy. Help me out."
01:15:26.522,01:15:27.648,"Oh, fuck!"
01:15:29.316,01:15:31.610,"-Freeze, motherfucker! -Ah. So weak."
01:15:31.693,01:15:32.653,Give me the alien!
01:15:35.697,01:15:37.157,-Give me the fucking alien! -No.
01:15:37.241,01:15:38.367,Ow! Fuck. Watch it.
01:15:38.450,01:15:39.910,Give me the alien!
01:15:53.549,01:15:55.842,Come this way! Follow us!
01:15:58.345,01:16:01.515,-Am I heavy? -I told you it's not fat. It's power!
01:16:03.141,01:16:05.018,"Oh, great."
01:16:10.482,01:16:12.401,I told you we should've parked closer!
01:16:14.820,01:16:16.780,Holster that. They're mine!
01:16:16.863,01:16:19.616,-Consider that a warning! -You crazy bastard!
01:16:21.201,01:16:23.078,"I got you, you little space freak."
01:16:23.161,01:16:26.248,-Ruth! Get back here! -Just go home!
01:16:32.462,01:16:34.464,"Coming, ready or not."
01:16:52.232,01:16:53.317,Papa!
01:16:53.400,01:16:54.318,"-Ruth, wait! -Wait!"
01:16:55.902,01:16:56.778,Papa!
01:17:03.535,01:17:05.454,"-Go, Clive, go! -Wait for me!"
01:17:05.537,01:17:08.582,-You're OK. Wait here. -Thank you. I'm OK.
01:17:16.632,01:17:17.466,Graeme!
01:17:22.054,01:17:23.472,Ruth! Drive!
01:17:29.186,01:17:30.687,Don't leave me!
01:17:40.072,01:17:41.948,"Graeme, you scared the shit out of me."
01:17:42.032,01:17:43.909,"Ruth, why aren't you driving?"
01:17:43.992,01:17:45.786,I told you. It's easy!
01:17:48.163,01:17:49.956,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
01:17:51.833,01:17:53.794,"Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it!"
01:17:53.877,01:17:56.129,Shit! Shit! Shit! Road! OK.
01:18:01.802,01:18:04.471,Oh! My weed!
01:18:24.074,01:18:28.286,"Motherfuckin', titty-sucking, two-balled bitch!"
01:18:39.715,01:18:41.508,"This is Haggard, sir!"
01:18:41.591,01:18:43.885,Agent Zoil is no longer in command!
01:18:43.969,01:18:46.513,I don't give a shit who's in command. Where the fuck are they?
01:18:46.596,01:18:49.683,"Just ahead of me, heading east towards Lytle Creek."
01:18:49.766,01:18:52.769,I don't wanna hear from anybody until that cocksucker is dead! Get me?
01:18:52.853,01:18:55.230,"Yes, sir. Ma'am."
01:19:01.903,01:19:03.530,Goddamnit!
01:19:07.492,01:19:10.203,This is official government business!
01:19:10.287,01:19:13.457,"Stand down, or I am authorized to use deadly force!"
01:19:13.540,01:19:16.084,That thing has my daughter!
01:19:16.168,01:19:17.794,This isn't your mission!
01:19:17.878,01:19:20.547,I'm on a mission from God!
01:19:20.630,01:19:22.424,-Tell him you failed!
01:19:36.980,01:19:38.774,Shit! We got company.
01:19:45.864,01:19:49.034,-He's trying to overtake us! -Don't let him get past!
01:19:49.117,01:19:50.952,-Should I ram him? -What about the deposit?
01:20:10.889,01:20:13.934,"-Oh, fuck. Come on! -Smile, you son of a bitch!"
01:20:14.017,01:20:16.394,"Eyes forward, butt-horn."
01:20:26.363,01:20:28.156,Do you think he'll be OK?
01:20:28.240,01:20:29.825,"Yeah, he'll be fine."
01:20:40.710,01:20:42.170,Where are the other two?
01:20:42.254,01:20:44.506,"One crashed and burned, the other just burned."
01:20:44.589,01:20:47.509,Jesus Christ! This has been one fuck-up after another.
01:20:47.592,01:20:49.177,I should have handled this myself.
01:20:49.261,01:20:51.596,I am very close. You give me one hour.
01:20:51.680,01:20:54.975,An hour? I'll be eating canapés with the governor in an hour.
01:20:55.058,01:20:57.894,"-I need this wrapped up now! -No, no. They're mine, damnit."
01:20:57.978,01:20:59.688,I'm gonna finish this once and for all.
01:20:59.771,01:21:01.815,"Too late, Zoil. I'm bringing in the big..."
01:21:10.782,01:21:14.369,"Fare thee well, my friend. You were a faithful and mighty steed."
01:21:14.452,01:21:17.664,-I can't believe she's gone. -Ain't that a bag of tits.
01:21:17.747,01:21:19.749,"Oh. What'll we do now, Paul?"
01:21:20.750,01:21:22.085,Paul?
01:21:37.684,01:21:39.811,-You'd know it when you saw it.
01:21:54.784,01:21:57.787,Ah. Right. Shoots flaming balls.
01:21:59.164,01:22:02.459,"-Can you just light the fuckin' thing? -Fireworks are not toys, Paul."
01:22:02.542,01:22:04.210,What is the suggested safe distance?
01:22:06.671,01:22:07.672,500 feet.
01:22:07.756,01:22:10.675,That will put us behind the tree line. We won't enjoy the full effect.
01:22:10.759,01:22:12.677,"-That's true, actually-- -Hey! What the...?"
01:22:22.312,01:22:23.605,Wow.
01:22:48.380,01:22:50.298,-Wow. -What now?
01:22:51.299,01:22:53.343,We wait.
01:23:39.514,01:23:40.682,"Oh, no, you don't."
01:23:44.686,01:23:46.187,Wait a minute.
01:24:20.722,01:24:22.474,It's the Big Guy.
01:24:25.351,01:24:26.895,"Well, what do you know?"
01:24:26.978,01:24:28.772,Small world!
01:24:29.814,01:24:31.900,Paul!
01:24:31.983,01:24:33.276,Zoil?!
01:24:51.086,01:24:51.961,Huh?
01:24:59.761,01:25:02.430,Don't fucking move!
01:25:03.431,01:25:07.143,Ju... J... OK. Everyone be cool. Everyone just be cool.
01:25:07.227,01:25:09.646,"I gotta say, I'm a little hurt, Agent Zoil."
01:25:09.729,01:25:11.773,He introduced me to my wife. He's my friend.
01:25:11.856,01:25:15.902,You stupid son of a bitch. You could've been where I am in 15 years.
01:25:15.985,01:25:18.655,-I don't wanna be where you are. -Too bad.
01:25:18.738,01:25:21.825,"-Let's go, Mork. -Don't call me Mork."
01:25:23.910,01:25:25.161,No. He's going nowhere.
01:25:28.081,01:25:32.377,What do you think you can possibly bring to the table at this point in the game?
01:25:34.504,01:25:36.714,Blind fury.
01:25:38.883,01:25:41.761,-Oh. -False economy. I told you.
01:25:41.845,01:25:44.430,"Step aside, fag."
01:26:03.950,01:26:05.785,Oh!
01:26:24.554,01:26:26.014,"Zoil. You OK, man?"
01:26:27.307,01:26:28.725,"So much for the plan, huh?"
01:26:28.808,01:26:30.268,"I know, right?"
01:26:30.351,01:26:32.145,I'm sorry I zapped you at the farmhouse.
01:26:32.228,01:26:35.106,That's OK. Sorry I wasn't there to meet you outside the base.
01:26:35.190,01:26:38.943,"By the time I got there, you'd gone. But I see you got yourself a plan B."
01:26:41.237,01:26:43.948,Hello. Pleasure to meet you boys. You did a hell of a job.
01:26:44.032,01:26:45.325,"Thank you, Agent Zoil."
01:26:45.408,01:26:47.410,Please call me Lorenzo.
01:26:49.370,01:26:51.372,That's right.
01:26:55.752,01:26:56.628,Papa?
01:27:00.632,01:27:01.925,Paul!
01:27:06.846,01:27:08.181,That was close.
01:27:14.562,01:27:15.772,"Oh, my."
01:27:17.482,01:27:18.983,No!
01:27:19.067,01:27:21.444,"Oh, God, Graeme! Graeme!"
01:27:22.445,01:27:24.948,"-I never meant to-- -Put the gun down, Mr Buggs."
01:27:25.031,01:27:26.658,"Drop the fucking gun, Dad!"
01:27:34.749,01:27:37.794,"No, no, no. It's... It's fine. It's fine, Clive."
01:27:37.877,01:27:41.923,"-We've had a good time, haven't we? -Yeah. But you got shot."
01:27:43.091,01:27:47.470,"Yeah, I know, but I can honestly say, Clive, this is the most fun I have ever had."
01:27:53.810,01:27:55.979,Graeme?
01:28:01.109,01:28:02.235,Graeme?
01:28:09.534,01:28:11.035,"I've gotta try, right?"
01:28:13.288,01:28:15.039,Yeah.
01:28:15.123,01:28:16.124,"No, no."
01:29:12.722,01:29:13.931,Paul!
01:29:14.015,01:29:15.933,Oh.
01:29:18.936,01:29:20.855,Paul?
01:29:38.706,01:29:41.834,"Well, that sucked. I don't even get to eat him."
01:29:47.715,01:29:49.801,"Wasn't that really, really dangerous?"
01:29:49.884,01:29:54.097,Sometimes you just gotta roll the dice.
01:29:58.893,01:30:02.146,The Lord has delivered his healing hand!
01:30:02.230,01:30:04.398,Can't win with these people.
01:30:08.903,01:30:11.197,Sorry you got killed by my dad.
01:30:11.280,01:30:12.698,That's... That's fine.
01:30:13.908,01:30:15.827,Do you wanna try that kiss again?
01:30:15.910,01:30:17.328,Fuck yeah.
01:30:23.876,01:30:24.794,Huh?
01:30:33.094,01:30:37.473,"Well, ain't this-- Whoa!"
01:30:38.099,01:30:41.769,I changed my mind. That is Jenga.
01:31:08.671,01:31:09.922,Thank you.
01:31:10.006,01:31:11.257,"Look, Mr Buggs."
01:31:13.676,01:31:14.969,Sorry I frightened the shit out of you.
01:31:15.052,01:31:18.973,You didn't frighten me. You freed me.
01:31:19.056,01:31:20.975,I'm glad.
01:31:21.058,01:31:25.104,Hmm. That's nice. Thanks.
01:31:30.234,01:31:31.903,"Hey. Take care of her, big man."
01:31:31.986,01:31:34.155,"Oh, I will, sir. And God be with you."
01:31:34.238,01:31:37.116,"Yeah. Whatever, dude. Sure."
01:31:41.329,01:31:43.122,Say bye to Karen for me.
01:31:44.540,01:31:46.334,"Safe trip, Short Round."
01:31:46.417,01:31:48.252,Thanks.
01:31:57.970,01:32:00.306,"-Oh, you're coming with me. -What?"
01:32:01.349,01:32:03.059,"I ruined your life, Tara."
01:32:03.142,01:32:05.144,I think it's only right I give you a new one.
01:32:06.646,01:32:07.647,Huh.
01:32:08.648,01:32:10.358,I don't have my toothbrush.
01:32:10.441,01:32:14.445,"Baby, where we're going, you don't need teeth."
01:32:23.871,01:32:27.083,Yeah. She's cool. She's with me. Let her in. Yeah. No.
01:32:32.171,01:32:33.214,Gentlemen.
01:32:36.842,01:32:38.094,What did you think of the book?
01:32:38.177,01:32:41.180,"Oh, no. I liked it. Actually, I really liked it."
01:32:41.264,01:32:44.016,There's lot of good... ideas in it.
01:32:44.100,01:32:47.019,"I kind of found it hard to finish, to be honest."
01:32:50.523,01:32:52.608,"Keep it for the journey home, if you like."
01:32:52.692,01:32:53.901,"Oh, yeah. No, definitely."
01:32:56.320,01:32:57.989,Three tits. Awesome.
01:32:59.824,01:33:03.244,"Well, safe to say we've all learned something from this."
01:33:03.327,01:33:06.330,"Be yourselves, speak from your heart. Some shit like that. I don't know."
01:33:06.414,01:33:09.750,"Yeah. You know, I certainly feel a bit different."
01:33:10.751,01:33:11.961,And me.
01:33:12.795,01:33:15.006,"Thank you, guys."
01:33:15.089,01:33:17.008,"No, thank you."
01:33:17.091,01:33:18.551,"Yeah. Thanks, Paul."
01:33:20.011,01:33:21.762,Hugs?
01:33:21.846,01:33:23.097,Come on!
01:33:27.768,01:33:29.645,"Clive, I can feel your boner."
01:33:36.360,01:33:37.737,Till next time.
01:34:13.147,01:34:15.107,See ya!
01:34:15.191,01:34:16.859,Good-bye!
01:34:24.617,01:34:27.411,This ship takes off very slowly. It's a little awkward.
01:34:27.495,01:34:29.038,Good-bye!
01:35:25.136,01:35:26.887,"That was good, wasn't it?"
01:35:55.040,01:35:56.333,Sorry. Who are you?
01:35:56.959,01:35:58.752,Someone who loves you.
01:35:58.836,01:36:02.298,Hey! I thought you were coming as Wonder Woman today.
01:36:07.094,01:36:14.518,All right. Would you please welcome the team behind this year's multi-Nebulon-award-winning best seller.
01:36:20.774,01:36:23.360,"By the way, these are friends of mine."
01:36:23.444,01:36:25.613,"I'm very proud of you, Graeme."
01:36:25.696,01:36:27.781,"I'm very proud of you, Sausage."
01:36:27.865,01:36:28.741,Come on.
01:36:38.876,01:36:42.379,"Pat Stevens? Like, Pat Stevens from chapter one?"
01:36:42.463,01:36:43.506,The very same.
01:36:43.589,01:36:45.299,"You know, I always pictured you taller."
01:36:45.382,01:36:48.219,"-Well, you should see me standin' up. -Oh, I'd like that."
01:36:57.436,01:37:00.189,I didn't realize you were so damn pretty.
01:37:00.272,01:37:02.399,You should see me out of these crazy clothes.
01:37:02.483,01:37:03.984,I'd like that.
01:37:06.612,01:37:08.739,No. I can't.
01:37:12.493,01:37:17.998,"I understand, apparently, they are citing me as the... as the..."
01:37:18.082,01:37:19.333,"Well, fuck. You know."
01:37:23.295,01:37:27.341,Please welcome to the stage Clive Gollings and Graeme Willy.
01:37:27.424,01:37:28.592,Give it up.
01:37:34.056,01:37:36.183,Congratulations. Congratulations.
01:37:37.351,01:37:38.352,Yay!
01:37:49.572,01:37:52.950,Graeme! Clive! Whoo!
01:37:53.033,01:37:54.326,I know those guys!
01:38:12.052,01:38:13.053,-You! -Hi.
