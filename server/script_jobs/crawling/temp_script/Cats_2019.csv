00:07:45.798,00:07:47.091,I wouldn't if I were you.
00:07:47.175,00:07:49.552,Could get dangerous.
00:07:51.387,00:07:54.974,"You know, they say Macavity will win this year."
00:07:55.057,00:07:56.225,Macavity?
00:08:02.356,00:08:03.649,A wonderful magician.
00:08:12.366,00:08:13.993,One moment you see him...
00:08:16.954,00:08:18.080,Come on!
00:08:29.800,00:08:32.011,"So, what's your name?"
00:08:37.517,00:08:38.768,Cat got your tongue?
00:08:40.269,00:08:42.438,-Victoria. -Victoria?
00:08:44.357,00:08:45.733,You must have another.
00:08:46.984,00:08:48.110,Another?
00:08:50.154,00:08:55.159,The naming of cats is a difficult matter.
00:08:55.826,00:08:59.121,It isn't just one of your holiday games.
00:08:59.664,00:09:07.672,You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have three different names.
00:09:08.339,00:09:12.009,"First of all, there's the name that the family use daily."
00:09:12.093,00:09:13.219,-Such as... -Peter.
00:09:13.302,00:09:15.054,-Augustus. -Alonzo.
00:09:15.137,00:09:16.055,Or James.
00:09:16.138,00:09:20.142,"But I tell you, a cat needs a name that's particular."
00:09:20.226,00:09:23.896,A name that's peculiar and more dignified.
00:09:23.980,00:09:31.988,"Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular, or spread out his whiskers or cherish his pride?"
00:09:32.071,00:09:35.825,"But above and beyond, there's still one name left over."
00:09:35.908,00:09:39.495,And that is the name that you never will guess.
00:09:39.579,00:09:43.082,The name that no human research can discover.
00:09:43.165,00:09:46.919,But the cat herself knows and will never confess.
00:09:47.003,00:09:54.218,"When you notice a cat in profound meditation, the reason, I tell you as always the same."
00:09:54.302,00:10:04.687,"Her mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of her name."
00:10:05.187,00:10:23.414,"Her ineffable, effable, effanineffable, deep, and inscrutable, singular name, name, name, name..."
00:10:23.497,00:10:27.376,"name, name, name..."
00:10:27.460,00:10:32.089,"name, name, name..."
00:11:33.109,00:11:36.987,"Mr. Mistoffelees, the magical cat!"
00:12:41.510,00:12:44.889,Full of wonders one Jellicle only will see.
00:12:45.389,00:12:49.268,And Jellicles ask because Jellicles dare.
00:12:50.394,00:12:52.062,Who will it be?
00:12:56.317,00:12:58.194,The Heaviside Layer?
00:12:58.277,00:13:00.404,"Far, far up in the sky."
00:13:00.488,00:13:04.116,From where the most deserving cat will be reborn into another life.
00:13:04.200,00:13:06.785,So they can be who they've always dreamed of being.
00:13:08.287,00:13:10.122,How will they be chosen?
00:13:10.206,00:13:12.875,"By singing the song of themselves, of course."
00:13:12.958,00:13:15.628,Who they are and what they do.
00:13:20.257,00:13:21.091,Come.
00:13:21.175,00:13:24.428,Come and see a cat who's competing to be the Jellicle choice tonight.
00:17:02.855,00:17:03.856,Faces!
00:17:07.484,00:17:08.360,Mmm.
00:17:14.825,00:17:16.952,And now for the icing on the cake.
00:17:18.037,00:17:19.496,Why does she want another Jellicle life?
00:17:19.580,00:17:21.874,I cannot keep being in this kitchen.
00:17:23.876,00:17:25.461,Don't get cocky!
00:18:06.043,00:18:08.295,"It's a little old-fashioned, don't you think?"
00:18:08.921,00:18:12.007,With the cockroaches dancing and the mice singing.
00:18:12.091,00:18:14.051,"Well, actually, the mice were really good."
00:18:15.677,00:18:16.970,But it's all a bit old-school.
00:18:17.054,00:18:18.055,Get out.
00:18:21.016,00:18:25.104,"Well... Well, actually, I just thought I'd have a feed at the back."
00:18:25.187,00:18:26.897,Get out of this kitchen now.
00:18:26.980,00:18:28.065,Let's dance!
00:18:36.907,00:18:38.200,Hmm. Hmm.
00:18:56.635,00:18:57.553,"Thanks, Tugger!"
00:19:13.944,00:19:14.903,No!
00:19:45.267,00:19:47.561,-Ooh! -Do you think he just got neutered?
00:19:47.644,00:19:48.770,"'Cause those notes are, like..."
00:20:11.627,00:20:13.503,"I can dance how he dances, too."
00:20:17.132,00:20:18.008,It's easy.
00:20:48.872,00:20:49.998,Uh!
00:20:58.465,00:21:00.050,Stop milking it.
00:21:06.181,00:21:07.015,Whoo!
00:21:19.069,00:21:20.529,Yeah!
00:21:42.634,00:21:44.303,"Nah, nah. No more milk."
00:21:48.056,00:21:50.225,Milk!
00:21:50.892,00:21:52.352,Whoo!
00:22:29.014,00:22:30.057,Wow.
00:26:19.119,00:26:21.538,She used to be the star of the Windmill.
00:26:22.956,00:26:25.083,Then she went with Macavity.
00:26:43.810,00:26:44.811,Meow!
00:26:44.894,00:26:47.897,"Oh, no. Look what the cat dragged in."
00:26:47.981,00:26:50.942,"Oh, my. You look absolutely starving."
00:26:51.026,00:26:53.570,You can't attend the ball on an empty stomach.
00:26:54.154,00:26:55.739,"So, you're hoping to be chosen?"
00:26:55.822,00:27:01.870,"Yeah. He wants to be reborn as a thin cat, so he can get fat all over again, but he's going to lose!"
00:27:01.953,00:27:03.288,How dare you! Don't listen to her.
00:27:03.371,00:27:38.782,"Don't you listen to him because he is a complete and utter-- Yeah, you've got it. Here we go."
00:27:38.865,00:27:39.908,Ha-ha!
00:27:40.825,00:27:42.118,Ready?
00:27:42.202,00:27:43.286,Whoo!
00:27:45.872,00:27:48.750,"Are you, by any chance, Jennyanydots?"
00:27:50.835,00:27:54.172,"You know, your work should be on the world stage."
00:27:54.255,00:27:55.507,Yes.
00:27:55.590,00:27:59.302,And that face should be on a poster.
00:28:03.223,00:28:04.307,Meow!
00:28:56.776,00:28:57.777,Oh!
00:29:24.345,00:29:27.265,"Right. That's not going to work, is it? Okay?"
00:29:27.348,00:29:32.979,"Look at you, and look at me, and you know, you know that I'm sensitive about my size, okay?"
00:29:36.816,00:29:38.026,"Okay? Now, listen."
00:29:38.109,00:29:40.153,You'll never get me up there on your own.
00:29:40.236,00:29:46.242,"So let's gather up a few more of the... cats, and we'll try again, shall we?"
00:29:46.826,00:29:48.161,Yeah. Okay. Nice and good.
00:29:48.244,00:29:50.455,"Everybody ready? And... Five, six, seven."
00:29:54.501,00:29:56.836,Hey! Ooh!
00:29:56.920,00:29:59.339,Gah!
00:30:00.548,00:30:02.300,Oh!
00:30:12.310,00:30:13.144,"Thanks, Tugger."
00:30:21.319,00:30:22.278,Ooh!
00:30:54.936,00:30:56.521,Yah!
00:30:56.604,00:30:58.398,Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo!
00:31:54.495,00:31:55.747,Spats?
00:31:56.497,00:31:57.707,Macavity!
00:32:00.043,00:32:01.002,I love it.
00:32:07.342,00:32:08.718,Hungry?
00:32:09.677,00:32:12.096,Look like you haven't eaten for days.
00:32:12.805,00:32:14.057,Go for it.
00:32:19.854,00:32:22.899,"Well, come on, Puss in Spats. You can do it."
00:32:24.150,00:32:25.777,Ha-ha!
00:32:31.240,00:32:32.325,Ineffable.
00:32:37.872,00:32:38.957,Can we help you?
00:32:39.040,00:32:40.667,You really shouldn't be out alone.
00:32:41.459,00:32:43.628,I'm not alone. I'm with my friends.
00:32:51.678,00:32:53.221,Why don't you come inside?
00:33:33.553,00:33:34.846,"No photos, right?"
00:35:07.355,00:35:09.899,"Hello, police officer. I bought these for her myself."
00:35:09.982,00:35:10.983,-You did what? -Wait.
00:37:47.807,00:37:49.141,I've been looking for you everywhere.
00:37:51.519,00:37:54.772,"Uh, I thought you'd miss the arrival."
00:37:54.855,00:37:56.190,What arrival?
00:37:56.691,00:37:58.025,Of Old Deuteronomy.
00:38:07.243,00:38:08.202,Oh!
00:38:19.213,00:38:20.756,And I've lost all of my cockroaches.
00:38:20.840,00:38:23.301,I can't be on a barge in the middle of the Thames.
00:38:23.384,00:38:25.052,I'm supposed to be going to the ball.
00:38:25.136,00:38:28.431,"Oh, no. You're not going anywhere, Puss in Spats."
00:38:29.015,00:38:33.602,"I'm determined to win, and I prefer my competition chained up."
00:38:34.520,00:38:37.231,Growltiger. Keep 'em here.
00:38:37.315,00:38:38.566,Meow!
00:38:39.400,00:38:42.528,He's called me that twice now. Puss in Spats.
00:38:42.611,00:38:44.739,Like it's sort of a joke. I rather like it.
00:38:44.822,00:38:45.906,So the joke's on him.
00:38:49.660,00:38:50.911,Who are you?
00:38:53.122,00:38:54.582,Growltiger.
00:39:15.519,00:39:17.480,"Right, no, see, that doesn't rhyme."
00:39:18.439,00:39:22.026,You can't just say Taymes 'cause it rhymes with aims.
00:39:22.109,00:39:23.027,It's the River Thames.
00:39:26.238,00:39:29.450,"Ow! Okay, so, it's Growltiger, you say?"
00:39:29.533,00:39:31.702,Yep. I think I've got it. I think that's it.
00:39:32.912,00:39:34.872,I fully understand now who it is.
00:39:35.373,00:39:36.999,Thank you for telling me.
00:39:42.421,00:39:43.589,Where have you been?
00:39:48.677,00:39:50.054,"Oh, it's mine."
00:39:55.101,00:39:57.395,You're just in time to see Old Deuteronomy.
00:39:58.020,00:40:00.106,Who is Old Deuteronomy?
00:42:58.867,00:43:00.035,-Who will it be? -Who will it be?
00:43:00.119,00:43:01.120,Who will it be?
00:43:01.704,00:43:03.747,-Who will it be? -Who will it be?
00:47:16.083,00:47:17.292,It's party time!
00:47:18.001,00:47:20.546,"With your permission, of course."
00:57:40.290,00:57:41.708,"We haven't met before, have we?"
00:57:43.168,00:57:45.587,No. I'm not from round here.
00:57:47.505,00:57:48.339,I was abandoned.
00:57:48.423,00:57:50.091,"Oh, poor thing."
00:57:52.093,00:57:54.721,Would you like to see me make the Jellicle choice?
00:57:55.221,00:57:57.849,-Am I allowed? -Why wouldn't you be allowed?
00:57:57.932,00:57:59.309,I'm not a Jellicle.
00:57:59.392,00:58:01.853,"Not yet, perhaps."
00:58:02.729,00:58:04.898,"Come, we're about to begin."
00:58:13.698,00:58:14.741,Gus.
00:58:15.783,00:58:17.160,"Gus, it's your call."
00:58:19.370,00:58:23.249,I just wanted to wish you jolly good luck.
00:58:23.333,00:58:25.418,I'm a tremendous fan of your work.
00:58:25.502,00:58:26.794,Hmm.
00:58:27.545,00:58:28.546,What's your name?
00:58:28.630,00:58:29.756,Mr. Mistoffelees.
00:58:29.839,00:58:31.758,"I'm a magic cat, you see."
00:58:31.841,00:58:33.510,Oh.
00:58:38.223,00:58:39.474,Do you ever get nervous?
00:58:39.557,00:58:41.851,"No, no. It's all practice, practice, practice."
00:58:41.935,00:58:43.561,Then nothing can go wrong.
00:58:45.688,00:58:46.564,Touch wood.
00:58:57.075,00:58:59.160,I've never played The Egyptian before.
00:59:07.877,00:59:10.630,Gus the Theater Cat.
00:59:13.758,00:59:14.884,Cross paws.
00:59:25.853,00:59:27.146,Hmm.
01:03:31.432,01:03:33.643,"I could do it again, you know."
01:03:54.080,01:04:02.338,To see Firefrorefiddle come alive tonight was truly inspirational and scary.
01:04:09.387,01:04:12.348,Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat.
01:08:12.963,01:08:14.131,Skimble! Aah!
01:08:18.803,01:08:19.637,Cats!
01:09:06.350,01:09:07.685,Macavity.
01:14:21.373,01:14:24.126,The time has come to make the Jellicle choice.
01:14:27.546,01:14:30.090,"Old Deuteronomy, if you would."
01:14:32.843,01:14:36.805,As I am the only contestant left.
01:14:39.308,01:14:40.976,"And, quite obviously, the best."
01:14:44.646,01:14:45.564,And so...
01:14:47.149,01:14:47.983,Never.
01:14:52.154,01:14:56.366,I choose the cat that deserves a new life.
01:14:57.451,01:14:59.495,I judge a cat by its soul.
01:14:59.578,01:15:02.873,-He's got soul. -I've got plenty of soul.
01:15:02.956,01:15:04.166,"You're a cheat, Macavity."
01:15:11.882,01:15:13.091,Oh!
01:15:28.315,01:15:29.691,Deuteronomy...
01:15:29.775,01:15:32.819,-I am going to the Heaviside Layer. -Ah!
01:15:32.903,01:15:35.739,I demand that you grant me another life.
01:15:35.822,01:15:38.450,You will never go to the Heaviside Layer.
01:15:38.534,01:15:40.536,Oh. We'll see about that.
01:15:41.036,01:15:44.206,"Growltiger, make her walk the plank."
01:15:53.840,01:15:55.842,...or you'll drown in that river.
01:16:04.351,01:16:05.602,Where is Old Deuteronomy?
01:16:09.523,01:16:10.649,Where is she?
01:16:12.693,01:16:13.860,We don't know.
01:16:15.529,01:16:16.863,"Look, it was only a bit of fun."
01:16:16.947,01:16:19.199,We didn't know he was gonna take Old Deut.
01:16:24.580,01:16:26.331,There must be something we can do.
01:16:35.549,01:16:36.758,"Yes, we can."
01:16:44.349,01:16:45.851,You're a magician.
01:16:51.231,01:16:52.316,Might be worth a try.
01:16:52.399,01:16:54.067,"Really, I can't."
01:16:54.151,01:16:55.319,You could try.
01:17:03.368,01:17:04.453,Good luck.
