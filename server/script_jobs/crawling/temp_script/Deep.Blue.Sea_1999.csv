00:19:38.469,00:19:40.847,"HEY, CARTER, COME AND JOIN US."
00:19:40.847,00:19:43.891,THERE'S TOO MUCH WOMAN ON THIS DECK FOR SCOGGS TO HANDLE.
00:19:43.891,00:19:45.518,"VODKA, STRAIGHT."
00:19:45.518,00:19:50.940,"AND, BY THE WAY, FOOD WAS EXCELLENT, BROTHER."
00:19:53.275,00:19:55.820,"YOU'RE THE GUY THAT GOT CAUGHT IN THAT AVALANCHE, RIGHT?"
00:19:55.820,00:19:57.989,YEAH. I'M THE ONE.
00:19:57.989,00:20:03.828,LIKE BLACK MEN DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WAYS TO GET KILLED WITHOUT CLIMBING UP SOME STUPID-ASS MOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF GOD'S NOWHERE.
00:20:03.828,00:20:06.664,"NEED TO LEAVE THAT TO THE WHITE FOLKS, BROTHER."
00:20:13.838,00:20:15.422,HAPPY BIRTHDAY?
00:20:16.298,00:20:18.759,I'LL LET YOU KNOW TOMORROW.
00:20:20.219,00:20:22.138,HOW'S LIFE UNDERWATER?
00:20:22.138,00:20:30.104,"WELL, IT'S...A LOT LESS COMPLICATED THAN IT IS ON THE SURFACE, THAT'S FOR SURE."
00:20:30.104,00:20:34.025,NICE WORK WITH THAT NEW TIGER SHARK TODAY.
00:20:34.025,00:20:36.235,ONE DAY YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL ME HOW YOU LEARNED THAT.
00:20:36.235,00:20:41.281,ONE DAY YOU'LL TAKE ME UP ON THAT BEER AND MAYBE I WILL.
00:20:41.281,00:20:44.160,"WELL, IT'S ALL WORK FOR ME, CARTER."
00:20:44.160,00:20:46.996,"BUT LIKE YOU SAID, ONE DAY."
00:20:46.996,00:20:52.877,SHARKS NEVER GET CANCER OR GO BLIND OR SHOW ANY LOSS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY AS THEY AGE.
00:20:52.877,00:20:55.295,UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE I KNOW.
00:20:55.295,00:20:58.298,SHARKS ARE THE OLDEST CREATURES ON THE PLANET.
00:20:58.298,00:21:03.804,FROM A TIME WHEN THE WORLD WAS JUST FLESH AND TEETH.
00:21:03.804,00:21:10.811,"BY USING A HORMONAL ENHANCER, WE INCREASED THIS FEMALE'S FOREBRAIN TO 5 TIMES ITS NORMAL SIZE."
00:21:10.811,00:21:12.063,TO HARVEST MORE PROTEIN.
00:21:12.063,00:21:16.025,EXACTLY. THE PROTEIN THAT MAY REACTIVATE-- THAT WILL.
00:21:16.025,00:21:21.155,THAT WILL REACTIVATE HUMAN BRAIN CELLS IS STORED IN THE FOREBRAIN OF THE SHARK.
00:21:21.155,00:21:25.993,I'M JUST AMAZED WE'VE COME SO FAR SO FAST WITHOUT GENETIC TAMPERING.
00:21:25.993,00:21:34.210,"GENETIC ENGINEERING TO INCREASE BRAIN MASS IS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE HARVARD GENETICS COMPACT, NOT TO MENTION, CHIMERA POLICY."
00:21:35.377,00:21:38.881,THEY'RE HUNTING IN PACKS...
00:21:38.881,00:21:40.507,LIKE WILD DOGS.
00:21:42.218,00:21:44.762,THEY'LL ONLY EAT OTHER SHARKS.
00:21:44.762,00:21:46.889,YOU'RE READING TOO MUCH INTO IT.
00:21:48.057,00:21:50.851,THAT GEN I ATTACKED A 25-FOOT BOAT.
00:21:53.146,00:21:55.856,"AM I READING TOO MUCH INTO THAT, TOO?"
00:21:57.233,00:21:59.026,DID YOU TELL FRANKLIN?
00:22:00.945,00:22:07.243,"I'M JUST THE FISHKEEPER, LADY, BUT BRINGING IN THAT SHARK AHEAD OF SCHEDULE IS A VERY BAD IDEA."
00:22:10.079,00:22:11.831,DO YOU LIKE YOUR JOB?
00:22:15.751,00:22:18.171,"ARE YOU THREATENING ME, DOC?"
00:22:18.171,00:22:20.339,NO.
00:22:20.339,00:22:24.969,"BUT IF WE DON'T PULL OFF THAT TEST TOMORROW, WE'RE ALL ON THE STREET."
00:22:27.305,00:22:32.977,"NOW, YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CARTER, BUT WITH YOUR BACKGROUND..."
00:22:37.023,00:22:38.191,AH.
00:22:39.441,00:22:40.567,RIGHT.
00:23:00.046,00:23:01.797,HOW'S MISS SMARTY-PANTS?
00:23:01.797,00:23:05.383,I HOPE SHE'S NOT AS DUMB AS SHE SEEMS.
00:23:05.383,00:23:07.970,RAISE THOSE FENCES LIKE I ASKED?
00:23:07.970,00:23:10.348,I TOOK CARE OF IT.
00:23:10.348,00:23:12.225,LET'S GO GET A BEER.

00:23:35.873,00:23:48.010,"REPEAT--U.S. COAST GUARD ADVISORIES-- ANY OF YOUR NONSENSE THIS MORNING, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TINY LITTLE DRUMSTICKS ON THE MENU TONIGHT."
00:23:48.010,00:23:49.136,FAT BUTT.
00:23:50.930,00:23:54.058,THAT'S RIGHT.
00:24:44.108,00:24:46.277,"WELCOME TO MY PARLOR, MR. FRANKLIN."

00:25:04.337,00:25:06.255,I CAN'T IMAGINE THERE'S MUCH VISIBILITY BELOW.
00:25:06.255,00:25:09.342,"CARTER, YOU COPY?"
00:25:10.676,00:25:11.969,CARTER?
00:25:11.969,00:25:14.721,Carter: I'M OK. I'M APPROACHING THE TUNNEL.
00:25:14.721,00:25:17.683,BINGO. ELVIS HAS LEFT THE BUILDING.
00:25:17.683,00:25:20.019,"OK. WE PICKED YOU UP, BUT VISIBILITY IS NEAR ZERO."
00:25:20.019,00:25:22.229,Carter: NO PROBLEM.
00:26:05.939,00:26:07.607,HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN SYNCHRONIZED LIKE THIS?
00:26:07.607,00:26:08.734,I DON'T KNOW.
00:26:14.907,00:26:17.659,TELL ME I DIDN'T SEE THAT.
00:26:21.163,00:26:22.831,THEY RECOGNIZED THAT GUN.
00:26:22.831,00:26:24.291,Jan: IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
00:26:24.291,00:26:26.460,SHARKS DO NOT SWIM BACKWARDS. THEY CAN'T.
00:26:26.460,00:26:27.920,"LET'S TRY TO STAY FOCUSED, PEOPLE."
00:26:27.920,00:26:29.629,WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
00:26:33.842,00:26:36.929,WE LOST PICTURE IN GEN II PEN.

00:44:31.085,00:44:36.715,"WE CLIMB DOWN TO LEVEL 3, WE GET TO THE WET ENTRY, WE TAKE THE SUB TOPSIDE 2 AT A TIME."
00:44:36.715,00:44:38.426,WE GO DOWN TO GET UP.
00:44:40.136,00:44:42.347,ALL RIGHT.
00:45:20.385,00:45:22.220,"OH, SHIT."
00:45:33.064,00:45:36.775,AAAAHHH!
00:45:36.775,00:45:38.695,"OH, SHIT!"
00:45:42.365,00:45:43.740,LISTEN. SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY MADE IT.
00:45:43.740,00:45:47.119,Scoggins: OVER HERE!
00:45:49.038,00:45:51.040,WHOA. WHOA. WHOA.
00:45:51.040,00:45:52.749,PREACH?
00:45:59.465,00:46:00.925,WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
00:46:00.925,00:46:02.510,"LAB EQUIPMENT MAYBE, BANGING AROUND."
00:46:02.510,00:46:04.178,THINK SO?
00:46:04.178,00:46:05.762,NOT A CHANCE.
00:46:07.890,00:46:08.891,OH!
00:46:08.891,00:46:10.435,WE'VE GOTTA GET PAST THAT DOOR.
00:46:11.644,00:46:12.645,GO! GO!
00:46:12.645,00:46:14.606,GO! GO!
00:46:14.606,00:46:16.982,AAH!
00:46:16.982,00:46:19.485,GO!
00:46:23.072,00:46:24.574,COME ON!
00:46:24.574,00:46:27.493,GET THE DOOR OPEN!
00:46:29.078,00:46:30.204,COME ON! PULL!
00:46:33.332,00:46:34.667,OPEN THE DOOR!
00:46:34.667,00:46:36.001,GO! GO!
00:46:39.756,00:46:40.757,GO!
00:46:40.757,00:46:42.174,MOVE! MOVE!
00:46:42.174,00:46:43.551,COME ON!
00:46:46.596,00:46:48.640,Carter: GO! GO!
00:47:08.200,00:47:10.745,BIRD!
00:47:12.288,00:47:13.581,"COME ON, BIRD."
00:47:13.581,00:47:15.667,"WHERE ARE YOU, BIRD?"
00:47:21.714,00:47:24.008,"Bird: HEY, HEY, YOU DICKHEAD!"
00:47:25.092,00:47:26.218,BIRD?
00:47:28.179,00:47:30.014,FAT BUTT.
00:47:30.014,00:47:31.140,BIRD?
00:47:35.060,00:47:37.104,BIRD?
00:47:37.104,00:47:39.357,ANYBODY HERE?
00:47:41.484,00:47:43.235,"SAY, COWBOY, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION."
00:47:43.235,00:47:44.737,WE SHOULD KEEP MOVING.
00:47:44.737,00:47:46.447,I'M TALKING TO HIM.
00:47:49.866,00:47:52.829,WAS THAT A GODDAMN SHARK BROKE THROUGH THAT DOOR?
00:47:52.829,00:47:53.830,I EXPECT SO.
00:47:53.830,00:47:55.748,YOU EXPECT SO.
00:47:55.748,00:47:57.834,"HUH. WELL, WELL, WELL."
00:47:57.834,00:48:01.920,AM I THE ONLY ASSHOLE DOWN HERE WHO THINKS THAT A TAD BIT ODD?
00:48:02.755,00:48:05.007,IT CAN DO THAT?
00:48:05.007,00:48:07.593,BUST THROUGH A STEEL DOOR?
00:48:07.593,00:48:08.927,I AIN'T THE EXPERT...
00:48:10.095,00:48:17.936,"BUT I'D SAY GIVEN GEN II's SIZE AND SOME ROOM TO MOVE, SHE COULD PUT A COUPLE TONS, MAYBE MORE, INTO A HIT."
00:48:17.936,00:48:20.356,"SO, YEAH, IN MY OPINION."
00:48:20.356,00:48:23.067,"SHE WANTS THROUGH, SHE'S COMING."
00:48:23.067,00:48:25.403,AND THESE SHARKS...
00:48:25.403,00:48:28.905,"THEY AREN'T JUST BREAKING DOWN DOORS FOR THE SHEER JOY OF IT, ARE THEY?"
00:48:28.905,00:48:30.199,THEY'RE AFTER US.
00:48:32.535,00:48:35.079,IT'S PRETTY DAMN OBVIOUS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING YET.
00:48:40.125,00:48:42.879,JUST WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO THOSE SHARKS?
00:48:46.048,00:48:52.012,THEIR BRAINS WEREN'T LARGE ENOUGH TO HARVEST SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF THE PROTEIN COMPLEX...
00:48:52.012,00:48:55.224,SO WE VIOLATED THE HARVARD COMPACT.
00:48:57.435,00:49:00.897,JIM AND I USED GENE THERAPIES TO INCREASE THEIR BRAIN MASS.
00:49:00.897,00:49:02.815,A LARGER BRAIN MEANS MORE PROTEIN.
00:49:02.815,00:49:06.819,"AS A SIDE EFFECT, THE SHARKS GOT SMARTER."
00:49:09.988,00:49:13.158,YOU STUPID BITCH.
00:49:20.708,00:49:24.211,"I DIDN'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN, BUT..."
00:49:24.211,00:49:28.340,WITH THIS RESEARCH WE COULD PRACTICALLY WIPE OUT DEGENERATIVE BRAIN DISEASE.
00:49:29.341,00:49:32.428,THINK OF THE GENERATIONS THAT WILL BE SAVED.
00:49:32.428,00:49:37.349,EXACTLY HOW MANY STICKS OF DYNAMITE WOULD YOU HAVE TO SET OFF IN YOUR EARS BEFORE YOUR HEAD CLEARED?
00:49:38.975,00:49:40.937,YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.
00:49:40.937,00:49:43.147,"I WOULDN'T, HUH?"
00:49:44.482,00:49:48.778,DUMB OLD CARTER WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU USED US?
00:49:50.987,00:49:52.657,THAT YOU USED ME?
00:49:54.450,00:49:57.787,SOMEONE ON THE WATER WHO WOULDN'T MAKE WAVES.
00:49:57.787,00:50:02.374,SOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS 'CAUSE HE HAD SOMETHING TO LOSE.
00:50:02.374,00:50:04.126,YOU DON'T SEE WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE.
00:50:04.126,00:50:08.506,WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS TAKEN GOD'S OLDEST KILLING MACHINE AND GIVEN IT WILL AND DESIRE.
00:50:08.506,00:50:11.676,WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS KNOCK US ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GODDAMN FOOD CHAIN.
00:50:11.676,00:50:14.553,THAT'S NOT A GREAT LEAP FORWARD IN MY BOOK.
00:50:17.890,00:50:19.224,THE PEOPLE WE'LL SAVE...
00:50:19.224,00:50:21.936,JIM? BRENDA?
00:50:23.437,00:50:24.730,US?
00:50:26.816,00:50:28.233,"ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE..."
00:50:28.233,00:50:32.655,"THESE SHARKS ARE THINKING, HARD AND CLEAR."
00:50:32.655,00:50:35.491,SO HERE'S THE RIDDLE...
00:50:35.491,00:50:42.038,"WHAT DOES AN 8,000-POUND MAKO SHARK WITH A BRAIN THE SIZE OF A FLATHEAD V-8 ENGINE AND NO NATURAL PREDATORS THINK ABOUT?"
00:50:43.457,00:50:45.877,I'M NOT WAITING AROUND HERE TO FIND OUT.
00:50:46.836,00:50:49.005,"NOW, YOU SEE HOW THAT WORKS?"
00:50:49.005,00:50:52.299,"SHE SCREWED WITH THE SHARKS, AND NOW THE SHARKS, THEY'RE SCREWING WITH US."
00:51:11.903,00:51:13.571,PLEASE LET ME GET OUT OF HERE.
00:51:25.457,00:51:27.459,OH!
00:52:20.012,00:52:23.015,SO WHY DON'T THE SHARKS GET THROUGH THE FENCE AND INTO THE OCEAN?
00:52:23.015,00:52:26.018,IT'S OK. THE FENCE ON THE OCEAN SIDE IS TITANIUM.
00:52:26.018,00:52:28.562,"AND IT GIVES, SO IT WORKS JUST LIKE A NET."
00:52:28.562,00:52:30.022,LET'S GET TO THE SUB.
00:52:30.022,00:52:32.024,WE'LL DISCUSS IT ON THE WAY TO THE TOP.
00:53:35.462,00:53:37.131,AAH! AAH!
00:53:45.139,00:53:46.473,"EAT ME, ASSHOLE."
00:53:51.311,00:53:53.313,CAREFUL NOW.
00:53:53.313,00:53:55.482,"COME ON, BIRD. COME ON."
00:53:55.482,00:53:56.901,TSK TSK TSK.
00:53:56.901,00:53:57.943,"PLEASE, BABY."
00:53:57.943,00:53:59.153,LIKE HELL.
00:53:59.153,00:54:01.822,SEE DADDY SMILING?
00:54:01.822,00:54:03.407,COME ON.
00:54:03.407,00:54:06.077,BRING YOUR FEATHERY ASS HERE.
00:54:11.498,00:54:14.501,AAH!
00:54:40.360,00:54:42.196,EXPLOSION CAUSE THAT?
00:54:42.196,00:54:43.530,NO.
00:54:43.530,00:54:48.953,THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT COULD HAVE BLOWN WITH ENOUGH FORCE TO MOVE THAT DAMN SUB.
00:54:48.953,00:54:51.496,"WHATEVER, IT'S JUNK."
00:54:51.496,00:54:56.376,"WELL, WE COULD ALL JUST DIVE IN AND SEE WHO MAKES IT TO THE TOP."
00:54:59.463,00:55:02.883,"ISN'T THAT THE OLD AQUATICA SPIRIT, DR. SUSIE?"
00:55:02.883,00:55:05.844,JUST DIVE IN?
00:55:08.180,00:55:10.682,YOU COULD GO FIRST JUST TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE.
00:55:10.682,00:55:12.268,"HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND, JANICE."
00:55:12.268,00:55:13.393,I'M NOT GOING IN THE WATER.
00:55:13.393,00:55:15.980,"COME ON-- NO WAY, MAN!"
00:55:15.980,00:55:18.314,"LISTEN, WE PUT THESE ON."
00:55:18.314,00:55:21.359,THEY HELP FIGHT HYPOTHERMIA.
00:55:21.359,00:55:27.992,"AND UNLESS SOMEONE'S GOT A BETTER IDEA, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SWIM OUTTA HERE."
00:55:45.717,00:55:48.179,THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
00:56:12.244,00:56:15.122,I'M NOT DANIEL WHEN HE FACED THE LION!
00:56:21.170,00:56:23.379,"SO I APPRECIATE THE IRONY, LORD."
00:56:23.379,00:56:25.674,COOK DIES IN HIS OWN OVEN.
00:56:27.592,00:56:30.721,BUT I GOT OTHER PLANS!
00:57:08.259,00:57:09.885,YOU ATE MY BIRD.
00:57:22.773,00:57:23.815,IS THAT THE SURFACE?
00:57:23.815,00:57:25.859,NO. THE VIBRATIONS ARE TOO DEEP.
00:57:25.859,00:57:26.985,THAT WAS FROM INSIDE.
00:57:37.371,00:57:38.956,I WOULDN'T GET THAT CLOSE IF I WERE YOU.
00:57:38.956,00:57:41.083,JUST A SUGGESTION.
00:57:41.083,00:57:43.710,WATER'S MURKY.
00:57:43.710,00:57:46.255,"NO WAY. NO, WE WON'T."
00:57:48.757,00:57:55.222,IT'S 230 FEET FROM THE LAGOON FLOOR TO THE LAGOON SURFACE!
00:57:55.222,00:57:57.849,THE AVERAGE HUMAN SWIMS 2 FEET PER SECOND.
00:57:57.849,00:58:00.978,THE AVERAGE SHARK SWIMS 50 FEET PER SECOND.
00:58:00.978,00:58:03.314,THERE'S NO WAY I'M GETTING INTO THAT POOL!
00:58:04.689,00:58:08.152,"NOW, WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS YOUR BASIC MAINTENANCE LADDER."
00:58:08.152,00:58:10.112,THIS LEADS ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SURFACE.
00:58:10.112,00:58:12.614,"I LOVE YOU, SCOGGS."
00:58:12.614,00:58:14.950,WAIT. WHY DO I FEEL A BUT COMING ON?
00:58:14.950,00:58:18.870,BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF SHAPE THE SURFACE LEVEL IS IN.
00:58:18.870,00:58:27.671,"THE SHAFT IS AIRLOCKED, BUT IF THE EXPLOSION HAS BREACHED THE SHAFT AT SURFACE LEVEL IN ANY WAY, WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH PRESSURE IN HERE TO KEEP THE WET POOL STABILIZED."
00:58:27.671,00:58:32.134,"AND IF THE POOL ISN'T STABILIZED, THERE'S A MILLION TONS OF OCEAN JUST DYING TO GET IN HERE."
00:58:32.134,00:58:34.094,YOU'LL BRING THE WHOLE FACILITY DOWN.
00:58:34.094,00:58:36.263,WE'RE BETTER OFF TAKING OUR CHANCES WITH THE SHARKS.
00:58:36.263,00:58:39.308,"YOU WANT TO GO SWIM WITH YOUR LITTLE FISHES, MISS, YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD!"
00:58:39.308,00:58:41.852,"ME, I'M OPENING THIS DOOR AND CLIMBING OUTTA HERE."
00:58:41.852,00:58:42.811,THE HELL YOU ARE!
00:58:42.811,00:58:44.438,I DON'T WORK FOR YOU ANYMORE!
00:58:44.438,00:58:45.897,ENOUGH!
00:58:46.773,00:58:49.651,THAT'S ENOUGH NOW FROM ALL OF YOU!
00:58:53.113,00:58:55.657,YOU THINK WATER'S FAST?
00:58:55.657,00:58:57.742,YOU SHOULD SEE ICE.
00:58:57.742,00:59:00.620,IT MOVES LIKE IT HAS A MIND.
00:59:00.620,00:59:02.331,LIKE IT KNOWS IT KILLED THE WORLD ONCE.
00:59:02.331,00:59:04.541,IT GOT A TASTE FOR MURDER.
00:59:05.876,00:59:10.381,"WHEN THE AVALANCHE CAME, IT TOOK US A WEEK TO CLIMB OUT."
00:59:11.715,00:59:13.342,AND SOMEWHERE...
00:59:13.342,00:59:15.093,WE LOST HOPE.
00:59:16.803,00:59:19.639,"NOW, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN WE TURNED ON EACH OTHER."
00:59:20.891,00:59:25.312,I JUST KNOW THAT 7 OF US SURVIVED THE SLIDE...
00:59:26.604,00:59:28.648,AND ONLY 5 MADE IT OUT.
00:59:31.276,00:59:33.153,"NOW, WE TOOK AN OATH..."
00:59:33.153,00:59:35.406,THAT I'M BREAKING NOW.
00:59:35.406,00:59:38.950,SWORE THAT WE'D SAY IT WAS THE SNOW THAT KILLED THE OTHER TWO.
00:59:38.950,00:59:41.828,BUT IT WASN'T.
00:59:41.828,00:59:43.455,NATURE CAN BE LETHAL...
00:59:44.915,00:59:47.959,BUT IT DOESN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO MAN.
00:59:50.587,00:59:55.050,"NOW, YOU'VE SEEN HOW BAD THINGS CAN GET AND HOW QUICK THEY CAN GET THAT WAY."
00:59:55.050,00:59:57.677,"WELL, THEY CAN GET A WHOLE LOT WORSE."
00:59:57.677,01:00:02.391,SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGHT ANYMORE!
01:00:02.391,01:00:06.811,"WE'RE GOING TO PULL TOGETHER, AND WE'RE GONNA FIND A WAY TO GET OUT OF HERE!"
01:00:06.811,01:00:10.690,"FIRST, WE'RE GONNA SEAL OFF THIS POOL."
01:00:25.456,01:00:27.124,"OH, MY GOD."
01:00:38.302,01:00:39.844,IT JUST ATE HIM.
01:00:41.012,01:00:42.556,"IT JUST ATE HIM, CHRIST."
01:00:43.765,01:00:45.058,I'M NOT MOVING.
01:00:45.058,01:00:48.312,I'M NOT MOVING FROM HERE.
01:00:48.312,01:00:51.106,"THEY'LL COME, AND THEY'LL GET US, AND WE'LL BE FINE."
01:00:51.106,01:00:52.107,SCOGGS.
01:00:52.107,01:00:54.443,"NO, I'M NOT MOVING."
01:00:54.443,01:00:56.027,"LISTEN TO ME, TOM."
01:00:56.027,01:00:59.531,WHAT IS THE PRECISE STRUCTURAL FAILURE LIMIT FOR AQUATICA?
01:00:59.531,01:01:01.408,"3,200 TONS."
01:01:01.408,01:01:05.912,"WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GET MORE THAN 3,200 TONS OF WATER IN THIS RIG?"
01:01:08.706,01:01:10.708,THE SUPPORT STRUTS GO FIRST.
01:01:10.708,01:01:13.670,THEIR TOLERANCE IS ABOUT 7 TONS.
01:01:13.670,01:01:15.672,THEY'RE GONNA CRACK LIKE TOOTHPICKS.
01:01:15.672,01:01:17.174,THEN THE WALLS ARE GONNA BUCKLE.
01:01:17.174,01:01:19.843,THEY CAN'T HANDLE MORE THAN 10 TONS OF PRESSURE.
01:01:26.933,01:01:28.935,"YOU WANT TO BE HERE FOR THAT, MAN?"
01:01:36.109,01:01:37.611,HELL NO.
01:01:37.611,01:01:39.029,HELL NO.
01:01:42.115,01:01:43.492,THE MOMENT OF TRUTH...
01:01:43.492,01:01:44.909,AGAIN.
01:02:00.175,01:02:01.718,"GO, GO, GO!"
01:02:01.718,01:02:03.803,"MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!"
01:02:20.737,01:02:22.072,GO!
01:02:46.221,01:02:48.223,AAH!
01:02:48.223,01:02:50.016,SCOGGS!
01:02:55.272,01:02:56.607,I GOT YOU!
01:03:02.613,01:03:05.657,Scoggins: IT'S BURNING!
01:03:11.580,01:03:15.917,"THE ELEVATOR'S BLOCKING THE TOP, BUT IF WE MAKE IT TO LEVEL ONE, WE CAN TAKE THE STAIRS UP."
01:03:52.036,01:03:54.122,LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
01:03:54.122,01:03:56.958,"GO, GO, GO!"
01:03:58.627,01:04:00.671,"WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
01:04:00.671,01:04:03.965,"IF THE SHARKS BREAK THROUGH THAT DOOR, THE WATER'S GONNA BRING THEM RIGHT TO US."
01:04:03.965,01:04:06.343,LEVEL 2's ONLY PARTIALLY FLOODED.
01:04:06.343,01:04:09.429,"IF I CAN GET THAT ACCESS DOOR OPEN, THE WATER'LL RUN OFF THERE."
01:04:09.429,01:04:10.806,BUY US SOME TIME.
01:04:13.975,01:04:15.977,"THEY'RE BIG, REAL BIG."
01:04:15.977,01:04:17.479,WHAT'S THAT?
01:04:17.479,01:04:19.731,THE SIZE OF YOUR BRASS BALLS.

01:06:27.275,01:06:29.277,"COME ON, COME ON!"
01:06:29.277,01:06:31.321,I CAN'T!
01:06:31.321,01:06:32.447,I CAN'T REACH!
01:06:32.447,01:06:33.740,LOWER!

01:07:25.041,01:07:27.752,REACH THAT DOOR ABOVE YOU?
01:07:31.464,01:07:32.966,IT'S TOO HIGH.
01:07:34.509,01:07:35.886,IT'S TOO HIGH.
01:07:57.782,01:08:00.159,"SHARKS PROBABLY FLOODED THAT LEVEL, TOO."
01:08:33.401,01:08:34.986,GOOD THING YOU GUYS CAME TO THIS SIDE.
01:08:34.986,01:08:36.529,THE OTHER SIDE IS UNDERWATER.
01:08:36.529,01:08:37.697,WE DIDN'T EXACTLY PLAN IT.
01:08:37.697,01:08:39.490,"YEAH, IT WASN'T LIKE A PLAN."
01:08:39.490,01:08:40.658,ARE YOU ALL THAT MADE IT?
01:08:48.499,01:08:49.834,Scoggins: WE DID IT.
01:08:49.834,01:08:51.419,WE'RE ON LEVEL ONE.
01:08:51.419,01:08:53.379,WE CAN TAKE THE ACCESS STAIR ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SURFACE.
01:08:53.379,01:08:55.506,THE STAIRS ARE FLOODED.
01:08:55.506,01:08:56.841,ARE YOU SURE?
01:08:58.093,01:09:00.678,GIVE US A GODDAMN BREAK!
01:09:12.273,01:09:13.691,HE ALWAYS ANSWERS.
01:09:14.776,01:09:18.404,SOMETIMES THE ANSWER YOU GET ISN'T THE ANSWER YOU WANT.
01:09:21.783,01:09:25.745,WE'RE 60 FEET FROM THE SURFACE.
01:09:25.745,01:09:28.414,"THERE'S AN EMERGENCY HATCH ON THIS LEVEL, RIGHT?"
01:09:28.414,01:09:29.833,"OK, LISTEN."
01:09:29.833,01:09:32.836,THIS LEVEL HAS BILGE PUMPS ON IT FOR STORM RUNOFF.
01:09:32.836,01:09:37.632,"IF WE COULD REROUTE THE EMERGENCY GENERATORS, WE COULD DRAIN ONE WHOLE STAIRWAY."
01:09:37.632,01:09:38.883,YOU SURE?
01:09:38.883,01:09:40.885,WHO ARE YOU GONNA TRUST?
01:09:43.471,01:09:44.973,YOU.
01:09:44.973,01:09:45.974,THAT'S RIGHT.
01:09:45.974,01:09:47.767,YOU TRUST ME.
01:09:57.110,01:09:59.737,WE HAD POKER HERE TOMORROW NIGHT.
01:09:59.737,01:10:04.367,SHE'D ALWAYS DRAW TO THE INSIDE STRAIGHT WHEN SHE COULD HAVE STUCK WITH A PAIR.
01:10:04.367,01:10:05.827,BIG DREAMS.
01:10:12.500,01:10:15.795,"EVEN IN DEATH, STANDARDS."
01:10:16.963,01:10:19.423,"OK, JAN WAS A HEALTHY GIRL."
01:10:19.423,01:10:22.301,SOMETHING IN HERE HAS TO RUN ON BATTERIES.
01:10:22.301,01:10:23.761,NICE.
01:10:23.761,01:10:25.262,WHERE WOULD A GIRL KEEP HER...
01:10:25.262,01:10:27.473,NNNNN THING?
01:10:27.473,01:10:29.266,"HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?"
01:10:36.482,01:10:39.485,MY SKIN'S STARTING TO HEMORRHAGE.
01:10:39.485,01:10:42.197,THE SHARKS SMELL THE BLOOD.
01:10:43.656,01:10:45.575,SO I COAT IT WITH OIL.
01:10:45.575,01:10:47.952,"CARTER, WHAT YOU SAID DOWN THERE..."
01:10:48.995,01:10:51.372,MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT.
01:10:51.372,01:10:54.542,EVERYTHING I'VE DONE...
01:10:56.293,01:10:59.547,I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.
01:10:59.547,01:11:01.591,"I KNOW, SUSAN."
01:11:01.591,01:11:03.342,THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
01:11:05.720,01:11:06.637,4 A.M.
01:11:06.637,01:11:08.431,I KNOW.
01:11:08.431,01:11:10.934,ONE NIGHT FEELS LIKE A WHOLE WEEK.
01:11:12.309,01:11:13.686,RELATIVITY.
01:11:13.686,01:11:15.105,WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
01:11:15.105,01:11:17.857,EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF RELATIVITY.
01:11:17.857,01:11:22.486,"GRAB HOLD OF A HOT PAN, A SECOND CAN SEEM LIKE AN HOUR."
01:11:22.486,01:11:27.491,"PUT YOUR HANDS ON A HOT WOMAN, AN HOUR CAN SEEM LIKE A SECOND."
01:11:27.491,01:11:29.577,IT'S ALL RELATIVE.
01:11:32.997,01:11:38.086,"I SPENT 4 YEARS AT CAL TECH, AND THAT'S THE BEST PHYSICS EXPLANATION I'VE EVER HEARD."
01:11:41.089,01:11:43.299,IT WORKS.
01:11:43.299,01:11:45.885,"ALL RIGHT, YOU STAY WITH THE DOC."
01:11:45.885,01:11:51.057,"ME AND SCOGGS ARE GONNA GO TRY AND GET TO THE WET LAB, DRAIN THAT STAIRWELL."
01:11:54.269,01:11:55.352,PREACH.
01:11:55.352,01:11:56.520,WHAT?
01:11:58.022,01:12:00.608,"WOULD YOU ZIP ME UP, PLEASE?"
01:12:31.472,01:12:34.142,WE GOT ONE.
01:12:34.142,01:12:37.645,"AND THERE'S YOU AND THE DOC, DOING A LITTLE BATHROOM LOVE."
01:12:37.645,01:12:40.523,"THEY GOT A PILL FOR WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, SCOGGS?"
01:12:51.159,01:12:54.204,"I NEED TO GET SOME THINGS FROM MY QUARTERS, PREACHER."
01:12:54.204,01:12:55.330,RESEARCH DATA.
01:12:55.330,01:12:57.207,TESTS THEY WANT.
01:12:58.499,01:13:00.459,SO MUCH DEATH ALL AROUND US.
01:13:00.459,01:13:02.337,TO RISK ANY MORE LIFE FOR SOME NUMBERS.
01:13:04.505,01:13:08.051,"WITHOUT THAT DATA, EVERYONE DYING ISN'T JUST TRAGIC."
01:13:08.051,01:13:09.093,IT'S USELESS.
01:13:09.093,01:13:11.637,"DEATH IS ALWAYS USELESS, DOCTOR."
01:13:22.732,01:13:24.441,THIS IS IT.
01:13:29.446,01:13:31.866,STAY HERE. BE BACK BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.
01:13:34.160,01:13:35.745,CARTER!
01:14:35.846,01:14:37.807,AAH!
01:14:37.807,01:14:39.892,AAH!

01:14:42.686,01:14:44.688,WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
01:14:44.688,01:14:47.317,WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON?
01:14:47.317,01:14:49.068,IT'S OK!
01:14:49.068,01:14:50.236,WHAT IS IT?
01:14:50.236,01:14:51.237,WE'RE ALL RIGHT!
01:14:51.237,01:14:52.613,WHAT THE FUCK?
01:14:52.613,01:14:54.031,IT'S OK.
01:14:54.031,01:14:55.032,IT'S OK.
01:14:55.032,01:14:57.243,IT'S OK.
01:14:57.243,01:15:00.079,I THOUGHT YOU WERE COMING BACK FOR ME.
01:15:00.079,01:15:02.373,ONE OF YOUR STUPID MONITORS IS BLOCKING THE PANEL.
01:15:02.373,01:15:04.667,YOU WANT TO HELP ME MOVE IT?
01:15:04.667,01:15:07.837,YEAH. WE DO EVERYTHING RIGHT TOGETHER.
01:15:07.837,01:15:09.464,YEAH.
01:15:09.464,01:15:10.965,RIGHT TOGETHER.
01:15:24.937,01:15:26.522,HELLO.
01:15:26.522,01:15:34.780,"MY NAME IS SHERMAN DUDLEY, AND IF THIS MESSAGE FINDS YOU, THEN I DID NOT SURVIVE, SO THIS IS MY LEGACY."
01:15:34.780,01:15:38.617,"I HAVE LOVED THE PULPIT, AND I HAVE LOVED THE BOTTLE."
01:15:39.660,01:15:43.706,"I DID MY BEST TO BE A GOOD HUSBAND, A FATHER."
01:15:43.706,01:15:45.916,I CAME OF WANTING.
01:15:46.959,01:15:49.712,SO WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU?
01:15:50.671,01:15:53.466,WHAT MARK DO I HAVE TO LEAVE BEHIND?
01:15:59.013,01:16:02.725,"WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE PERFECT OMELET, WHICH IS MADE WITH 2 EGGS, NOT 3."
01:16:02.725,01:16:04.935,AMATEURS OFTEN ADD MILK FOR DENSITY.
01:16:04.935,01:16:06.354,THIS IS A MISTAKE.
01:18:40.508,01:18:42.677,"CARTER, COME ON!"
01:19:15.209,01:19:17.920,I GOT YOU.
01:19:31.642,01:19:33.269,"DAMN IT, SCOGGS."
01:19:44.071,01:19:45.698,WHERE'S SUSAN?
01:19:46.949,01:19:50.703,"OH, I'M DONE."
01:19:46.949,01:19:53.497,BROTHERS NEVER MAKE IT OUT OF SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.
01:20:41.629,01:20:43.088,AAH!
01:21:35.516,01:21:36.975,AAH!

01:23:50.108,01:23:51.819,SUSAN!
01:23:55.113,01:23:57.073,DID YOU DO IT?
01:23:57.073,01:23:58.325,WHERE'S SCOGGINS?
01:24:00.619,01:24:06.458,"LOOK, I HATE TO INTERRUPT THIS MOMENT OF BURGEONING INTIMACY, BUT CAN WE GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE?"
01:24:17.011,01:24:18.512,IS THIS THE ONLY WAY?
01:24:18.512,01:24:19.471,EXITS ARE FLOODED.
01:24:19.471,01:24:20.890,THE WHOLE PLACE IS SINKING.
01:24:20.890,01:24:23.767,IT'S THIS WAY OR NO WAY AT ALL.
01:24:23.767,01:24:26.102,YOU CAN BRING ON THE GOOD NEWS ANY TIME NOW.
01:24:26.102,01:24:30.524,"SHARKS ARE ATTRACTED TO CHURNING WATER, BRIGHT COLORS."
01:24:30.524,01:24:32.776,THESE EXTINGUISHERS SHOULD BE A DISTRACTION.
01:24:32.776,01:24:34.778,GIVE ME THAT.
01:24:34.778,01:24:36.030,WHAT ABOUT US?
01:24:36.030,01:24:37.489,THE VESTS'LL BRING YOU UP TOO FAST.
01:24:37.489,01:24:39.074,YOUR LUNGS WOULD POP LIKE A BALLOON.
01:24:40.034,01:24:42.912,"YOU WEREN'T THE SUNNY KID IN YOUR CLASS, WERE YOU?"
01:24:42.912,01:24:44.287,I NEVER WENT TO CLASS.
01:24:45.372,01:24:48.667,"WELL, HOW FAR TO THE SURFACE?"
01:24:48.667,01:24:49.752,THERE'S NOTHING TO IT.
01:24:49.752,01:24:51.879,"REMEMBER, EXHALE ON THE WAY UP..."
01:24:51.879,01:24:53.422,AND GET THE HELL OUT OF THE WATER.
01:24:53.422,01:24:58.427,I GOTTA EQUALIZE THE PRESSURE BEFORE I BLOW THE AIRLOCK.
01:24:58.427,01:25:00.303,I GOTTA LET THE ROOM FILL UP WITH WATER.
01:25:02.598,01:25:04.391,IT'S ONLY GONNA TAKE A FEW SECONDS.
01:25:04.391,01:25:06.309,YOU READY?
01:25:08.353,01:25:09.688,NO.
01:25:09.688,01:25:11.565,NOT IN THE LEAST.
01:25:29.833,01:25:36.465,"YEA, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, I SHALL FEAR NO EVIL, FOR THOU ART WITH ME."
01:25:36.465,01:25:38.675,"THY ROD AND THY STAFF, THEY COMFORT ME."
01:25:38.675,01:25:48.393,"SURELY, THROUGH THIS, YOUR MERCY SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, BECAUSE I CARRY A BIG STICK, AND I'M THE MEANEST MOTHERFUCKER IN THE VALLEY."
01:25:48.393,01:25:51.563,"2 SHARKS DOWN, LORD."
01:25:51.563,01:25:52.940,CAN I GET AN AMEN?
01:25:52.940,01:25:53.983,AMEN.
01:25:53.983,01:25:55.233,I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

01:26:03.867,01:26:05.285,"OK, OK, HOLD ON 3."
01:26:05.285,01:26:06.411,READY?
01:26:06.411,01:26:08.789,"1, 2, 3."
01:27:33.331,01:27:35.417,AAH!
01:27:35.417,01:27:37.127,AAH!

01:27:39.129,01:27:40.756,NO!
01:27:44.718,01:27:46.929,SWIM!
01:28:24.674,01:28:26.426,GOD.
01:29:03.172,01:29:05.423,"IT'S THE DEVIL, YOU KNOW."
01:29:15.892,01:29:19.354,HE'LL BE OK IF WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE.
01:29:31.616,01:29:33.118,SON OF A BITCH.
01:29:33.118,01:29:34.911,WHAT?
01:29:34.911,01:29:39.374,"THOSE FENCES ARE TITANIUM UNDERNEATH, BUT ON TOP THEY'RE JUST PLAIN STEEL."
01:29:40.792,01:29:46.798,"THEY'VE BEEN HERDING US, PUSHING US WHERE THEY WANT, USING US TO FLOOD THE FACILITY."
01:29:48.925,01:29:51.178,"OH, MY GOD."
01:29:51.178,01:29:53.347,THAT'S THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE.
01:29:53.347,01:29:56.558,"BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT AN 8,000-POUND MAKO THINKS ABOUT."
01:29:56.558,01:29:58.894,ABOUT FREEDOM.
01:30:00.687,01:30:03.273,ABOUT THE DEEP BLUE SEA.
01:30:06.235,01:30:08.028,WE HAVE TO KILL HER.
01:30:10.155,01:30:13.742,"NOW, THAT'S THE FIRST REAL SMART THING YOU'VE SAID ALL DAY."
01:30:17.620,01:30:19.289,HERE WE GO.
01:30:36.390,01:30:37.891,LET'S GO.
01:30:48.484,01:30:52.155,WE OUGHT TO GET ABOUT 2 1/2 STICKS OF DYNAMITE OUT OF THESE FLARES.
01:30:57.911,01:31:01.873,"FROM UP HERE, YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SEE ME SPEAR IT."
01:30:59.746,01:31:06.378,"WHEN I DO, YOU TAKE THIS END OF THIS CABLE, HOOK IT UP TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BOAT BATTERY."
01:31:06.378,01:31:08.422,AND BOOM.
01:31:44.791,01:31:45.792,DAMN!
01:31:45.792,01:31:47.461,I CAN'T GET HER!
01:31:47.461,01:31:49.421,TOO FAR AWAY!
01:31:51.173,01:31:52.924,I KNOW HOW TO GET HER.
01:31:52.924,01:31:54.634,HOW?
