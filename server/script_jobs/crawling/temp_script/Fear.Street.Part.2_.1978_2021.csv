00:00:14.541,00:00:20.250,And last night… …tragedy struck again.
00:00:21.833,00:00:23.875,I'm here with Sheriff Nick Goode.
00:00:23.958,00:00:26.708,"Sheriff, what can you tell us?"
00:00:26.791,00:00:28.375,"Um, there were seven victims."
00:00:41.666,00:00:45.916,"She's been possessing people, turning them into killers, to take revenge on the town."
00:00:54.291,00:00:57.125,"But in 1978, there was one survivor, C. Berman."
00:00:57.208,00:00:58.333,She's the key.
00:01:10.375,00:01:11.500,It's never over.
00:01:55.000,00:01:59.916,"After a week of terror, Shadyside continues to live up to its twisted nickname."
00:02:00.000,00:02:07.416,"Clad in a Halloween skull mask, Shadyside High graduate Ryan Torres kicked off the days of terror with a massacre at the mall."
00:02:07.500,00:02:15.083,And now an already mourning community is plunged into horror yet again as the Sheriff's Department reports more carnage at East Union Medical.
00:02:15.166,00:02:18.291,Police believe the murders were fueled by amphetamines.
00:02:18.375,00:02:23.666,Local teenagers Kate Schmidt and Simon Kalivoda are the primary suspects.
00:02:23.750,00:02:27.250,The scene of the final carnage was the local grocery store.
00:02:27.333,00:02:32.250,Sheriff Nick Goode found the Grab and Bag soaked in blood and broken dreams.
00:03:17.041,00:03:18.250,"Major, Jesus!"
00:03:22.250,00:03:23.583,God damn it!
00:03:31.791,00:03:34.166,"You're an impatient bastard, aren't you?"
00:03:40.416,00:03:44.125,"My family have lived here for generations, cultivating the growth of our city."
00:03:44.708,00:03:52.750,"And now, as I take the torch …I'm ready to bring my experience to City Hall for another two years."
00:04:03.083,00:04:06.833,Let's work together to keep Sunnyvale shining!
00:04:43.583,00:04:46.458,"Stop, please! Please! We called you."
00:04:46.541,00:04:49.750,"Hello, my name is Deena Johnson. We need to know how you survived!"
00:04:49.833,00:04:52.541,"Hey! We're being attacked, alright? There are killers here!"
00:04:58.125,00:04:59.958,-Hello? -You're still alive.
00:05:01.375,00:05:06.916,C. Berman… Why the hell would you come here?
00:05:13.000,00:05:17.125,"No, no, no! You need to leave! Right now! You have no idea what you are doing!"
00:05:19.541,00:05:22.500,You are the only person who knows what we're dealing with.
00:05:22.583,00:05:26.458,I don't want that thing near me. Get that car and it off my property.
00:05:26.541,00:05:27.833,Her name is Sam.
00:05:27.916,00:05:31.916,"You could have watched us dead on the six o'clock news, but you didn't."
00:05:32.541,00:05:33.875,You called us back.
00:05:36.625,00:05:40.291,"You are our last chance! The witch-- No, I'm sorry."
00:05:45.125,00:05:46.666,you saw her and you survived.
00:05:46.750,00:05:49.333,What was different? Please.
00:05:49.416,00:05:53.208,"Maybe something happened to you, something that can help us stop her."
00:05:55.750,00:05:59.208,"Run, far as you can, fast as you can!"
00:05:59.291,00:06:00.875,That is your only chance.
00:06:00.958,00:06:03.458,"Look, I can't just run!"
00:06:04.125,00:06:08.000,"Look, Sam… I can't let her die."
00:06:09.333,00:06:10.333,I won't!
00:06:12.250,00:06:13.333,I love her.
00:06:15.500,00:06:16.583,Please!
00:06:21.041,00:06:23.625,Just keep her away from Major Tom.
00:06:45.583,00:06:46.833,It's completely fine.
00:06:47.750,00:06:52.458,"She's tied up in the bathroom, so she, like, totally can't leave now, we're cool."
00:06:55.708,00:06:56.750,"Cool, cool."
00:07:01.458,00:07:02.458,Take a seat.
00:07:10.833,00:07:12.625,the past is never really past.
00:07:24.666,00:07:26.333,The first day of camp.
00:07:33.541,00:07:35.875,"A week later, my sister was dead."
00:07:50.458,00:07:52.875,"Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!"
00:08:14.666,00:08:16.416,"You're gonna hang, witch."
00:08:19.041,00:08:20.791,she found a way to cheat her death.
00:08:25.000,00:08:28.708,"She reaches from beyond the grave, to make good men her evil slaves."
00:08:28.791,00:08:32.666,"She'll take your blood, take your head, she'll follow you until you're dead."
00:08:39.708,00:08:41.666,"Let me down, you shits! Let me down!"
00:08:47.333,00:08:50.750,"-Well, well. What do we have here? -Goddamn thief!"
00:08:53.458,00:08:55.708,She's possessed by the witch.
00:08:55.791,00:08:58.083,The only way to explain her psycho behavior.
00:09:02.375,00:09:03.750,Guess we're even now.
00:09:04.541,00:09:06.875,"You do know what they did to Sarah Fier, right?"
00:09:07.625,00:09:10.833,"They hanged her, from this very tree."
00:09:11.500,00:09:16.541,But she'd have died forever if you did what you always do to witches… You burn them.
00:09:18.416,00:09:20.500,-Give me your lighter! -What?
00:09:20.583,00:09:21.791,Give it to me!
00:09:23.291,00:09:24.416,"Now, hold her legs."
00:09:24.500,00:09:25.416,"Seriously, Sheila?"
00:09:27.500,00:09:31.083,"No, no, no! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!"
00:09:31.166,00:09:34.000,"-Shut up, you witch. -Sheila! You made your point."
00:09:40.500,00:09:41.583,"-Sheila! -No, no, no!"
00:09:46.875,00:09:48.041,"Nick, I can explain."
00:09:48.125,00:09:51.000,"Let her down, Will! I swear to God I'll tell Mom!"
00:09:56.458,00:09:59.833,All my money was gone and Ziggy was just sprinting away.
00:09:59.916,00:10:03.750,-Because you were chasing me. -Ziggy! You talk when I tell you to talk.
00:10:05.041,00:10:07.291,-Did you see her take it? -Everyone did.
00:10:09.750,00:10:12.583,"Well, that's it, Berman. Five strikes. You're out."
00:10:12.666,00:10:16.458,-I'm out? They just tried to murder me! -Yeah. And I'll deal with them.
00:10:16.541,00:10:20.625,"But first, get back to camp, call Mommy because you're done at Nightwing."
00:10:23.333,00:10:25.208,Like you didn't set the camp flag on fire?
00:10:25.291,00:10:28.916,Or let out the camp rabbits? Or graffiti the outhouse stalls?
00:10:31.125,00:10:33.000,"It's not her fault, really."
00:10:35.041,00:10:45.125,"-She's possessed by Sarah Fier. -Oh, you… We kick her out, somebody's gonna ask about the burn on her arm."
00:10:45.208,00:10:47.000,Then who's in trouble? Huh?
00:10:47.083,00:10:49.583,Why don't we just let this one slide? Yeah?
00:10:51.291,00:10:55.666,"Alright. One more strike and you're out for real. You hear me, Berman?"
00:10:55.750,00:10:56.833,One more.
00:10:58.375,00:11:00.208,Being bossed around by a Goode.
00:11:00.750,00:11:03.416,"Wow, some things never change."
00:11:07.541,00:11:09.458,"God, I hate that little bitch."
00:11:14.958,00:11:18.708,-Have Nurse Lane check that burn out. -I'm gonna let it get infected and die.
00:11:22.083,00:11:23.541,"I'm sorry, I forgot!"
00:11:24.291,00:11:31.625,"Thank you, King of Sunnyvale, future Police Chief Nick Goode, for rescuing poor, helpless Shadysider me!"
00:11:31.708,00:11:33.375,How could I ever repay you?
00:11:33.458,00:11:37.166,"Oh, I know. I'll bat my eyes at you, like all the other dumbass girls."
00:12:14.083,00:12:18.458,"Color War begins tonight, guys! Line up and grab a shirt! Do you have a shirt?"
00:12:18.541,00:12:21.250,"Blue is for beautiful, if you live in Shadyside."
00:12:21.333,00:12:23.875,"Red is for radiance, if you live in Sunnyvale."
00:12:23.958,00:12:26.958,"Despite our differences, we're all perfect!"
00:12:28.041,00:12:29.791,"Even you, Ziggy Berman!"
00:12:44.958,00:12:47.708,It just… It won't come off!
00:12:48.291,00:12:50.833,"That's been there forever, babe. Just give that up."
00:12:50.916,00:12:52.958,-Tommy! -I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
00:12:53.041,00:12:56.416,"You're right. It's just, you know, Color War is tonight."
00:12:56.500,00:12:57.958,I'm well aware!
00:12:58.041,00:13:00.041,We also have to get the Mess Hall ready.
00:13:02.333,00:13:05.833,Oh my gosh. This gosh darn moss!
00:13:05.916,00:13:07.708,It's… it's all over me!
00:13:07.791,00:13:11.375,"Oh, hey! It's OK! This isn't a big deal."
00:13:11.458,00:13:14.375,"What? No, it's not OK! It… it… it's stained!"
00:13:14.958,00:13:18.625,Only Cindy Berman would expect to clean the outhouse and not get dirty.
00:13:19.166,00:13:20.666,It's not funny!
00:13:21.666,00:13:22.791,It's kinda funny.
00:13:38.333,00:13:39.416,You better be.
00:13:47.458,00:13:48.458,What is it?
00:13:55.583,00:13:57.291,Where are they?
00:14:08.000,00:14:09.500,Oh my… Oh my God!
00:14:11.208,00:14:12.125,Hey.
00:14:12.208,00:14:14.875,-Um… what are you doing? -Three guesses.
00:14:22.208,00:14:24.791,"uh, uh… have to finish cleaning the outhouse."
00:14:24.875,00:14:29.416,"We're doing the shit jobs all summer, now we have to clean up actual shit? No."
00:14:34.125,00:14:35.708,"This is our last one, babe."
00:14:39.166,00:14:40.416,What are you doing?
00:14:41.083,00:14:42.375,Three guesses.
00:14:46.666,00:14:48.916,This isn't funny. We have a job to do.
00:14:52.375,00:14:54.208,"What, are you gonna snitch on me again?"
00:14:59.583,00:15:02.500,-About getting us some yellow jackets. -Yes.
00:15:02.583,00:15:04.583,-Or some red birds. -Both.
00:15:04.666,00:15:07.708,And then we'll scrub all the shit you want.
00:15:07.791,00:15:11.583,"-Yellow jackets, red… What? -Drugs, baby. Drugs."
00:15:16.291,00:15:18.708,Some people want to do things with their lives.
00:15:18.791,00:15:22.416,"So stop screwing with mine and just do your jobs, please!"
00:15:22.500,00:15:27.958,Maybe you should have thought about that before blasting Captain and Tennille for two hours straight.
00:15:30.041,00:15:31.250,Snitch.
00:15:38.625,00:15:39.625,Bye!
00:15:45.333,00:15:47.708,Where have you been? I've been looking all over.
00:15:47.791,00:15:55.500,"Your sister… Cindy Berman, that smell better be skunk."
00:15:56.666,00:15:58.000,What about my sister?
00:16:00.208,00:16:02.333,Nurse Lane! Hello!
00:16:03.541,00:16:05.291,I'm in trouble again. Help.
00:16:06.875,00:16:09.375,"Nurse Lane, come on! I could die any minute now."
00:16:15.458,00:16:16.458,Nurse Lane?
00:16:18.041,00:16:19.041,Nurse Lane?
00:16:47.916,00:16:48.916,Are you OK?
00:16:51.041,00:16:53.416,I am. Oh my goodness.
00:16:55.083,00:16:56.458,"Ziggy, Ziggy, Ziggy."
00:16:57.166,00:16:58.333,What did we do now?
00:16:59.166,00:17:04.333,"OK, so you are gonna apply this once a day for three days. OK?"
00:17:04.416,00:17:06.500,It's gonna protect against infection.
00:17:08.375,00:17:09.500,It's gross.
00:17:15.125,00:17:18.208,"So, um… what's the Witch's Mark?"
00:17:24.291,00:17:27.250,"You know about my daughter, right? Ruby Lane?"
00:17:27.333,00:17:30.875,Uh… -I don't-- -Of course you do.
00:17:32.000,00:17:33.583,"Everybody talks, I know."
00:17:35.375,00:17:36.916,"Tell me, what do they say?"
00:17:37.916,00:17:44.000,"Uh, um… They say she, uh… she killed people… at a party."
00:17:44.583,00:17:46.583,"-Seven, seven friends. -Eight."
00:17:48.625,00:17:51.000,She killed herself that night too.
00:17:51.083,00:17:52.333,So eight.
00:17:54.541,00:17:56.250,Ruby was such a sweet girl.
00:17:58.125,00:18:00.916,"Oh, and she had a sweet voice. She was in choir."
00:18:01.000,00:18:02.666,She wanted to be a singer.
00:18:06.833,00:18:08.500,I was so proud of her.
00:18:08.583,00:18:09.750,So proud.
00:18:11.583,00:18:16.250,"The doctors say it was a psychotic episode, that she just snapped."
00:18:16.333,00:18:20.166,But the kids… the kids say Sarah Fier made her do it.
00:18:20.250,00:18:22.125,That's a little tight.
00:18:22.208,00:18:29.333,-What do you think? -I don't-- 'Cause I think you don't go from being a sweet girl with dreams to ripping someone's insides out with a switchblade.
00:18:29.416,00:18:34.416,"-Nurse Lane! -People usually kill for a reason, and sometimes that reason is justified."
00:18:34.500,00:18:36.375,Sometimes killing isn't murder.
00:18:36.458,00:18:38.875,-Sometimes it's necessary. -That's hurting me.
00:18:38.958,00:18:40.750,-Sometimes it is good. -Nurse Lane!
00:18:46.125,00:18:48.041,"Once a day for three days, OK?"
00:18:51.250,00:18:52.416,"Hi, Nurse Lane."
00:18:53.458,00:18:54.541,"Hi, Cindy."
00:18:55.125,00:18:56.000,Ziggy.
00:18:57.250,00:18:59.875,"You realize what happens if you get kicked out, right?"
00:18:59.958,00:19:03.625,-How awful that would be for me? -Did someone do something to Nurse Lane?
00:19:03.708,00:19:05.541,Like make fun of her daughter?
00:19:05.625,00:19:08.208,"-Ziggy, are you listening to me? -She was upset."
00:19:08.291,00:19:13.000,"I don't care! I… -Do you hear what I'm saying to you? -Loud and clear, ma'am."
00:19:13.083,00:19:17.125,"You don't, we had this conversation last week and the week before that."
00:19:17.208,00:19:20.083,-I'm not gonna get kicked out. -That's not what Kurt thinks.
00:19:20.166,00:19:22.791,"-Yeah, well, Kurt can suck it. -No! Ziggy, no!"
00:19:22.875,00:19:24.750,"If you get kicked out, I do too."
00:19:25.500,00:19:29.750,"Mom can't work and take care of you. Then how will I pay for college, huh?"
00:19:32.416,00:19:33.708,"Yeah, kinda."
00:19:36.791,00:19:37.916,How dumb you are?
00:19:38.416,00:19:41.000,"No one gets out of this town, not even Miss Perfect."
00:19:41.083,00:19:43.041,Bet on your way out you get run over by a bus.
00:19:43.625,00:19:48.083,"Once in your life, could you just not be so… so mean?"
00:19:48.166,00:19:50.416,Could once in your life you just stop pretending?
00:19:51.791,00:19:54.375,"You're Shadyside, in case you forgot."
00:20:01.291,00:20:03.833,"Alice just, like… She just won't let it go."
00:20:03.916,00:20:09.958,It's like we're still 12 years old and her whole goal in life is to… to punish me for something that wasn't even my fault.
00:20:10.041,00:20:12.000,I can't believe you guys used to be friends.
00:20:14.041,00:20:17.375,It's only a matter of time before she ends up in jail or worse.
00:20:17.458,00:20:20.416,I'm trying to be a good role model and make something of myself.
00:20:20.500,00:20:25.708,"But no, no, I'm the stuck-up priss who hates fun, which isn't even true at all. I like fun. I like fun!"
00:20:25.791,00:20:29.666,I just… I just want to get out of Shadyside. Is that so crazy?
00:20:33.000,00:20:34.250,Shit!
00:20:36.250,00:20:38.708,"Not now, Tommy! Not in the mood!"
00:20:46.041,00:20:47.791,You're OK. You're OK.
00:20:49.208,00:20:50.083,…breathe.
00:21:03.166,00:21:04.500,"Tommy, is that you?"
00:21:12.791,00:21:13.791,Tommy?
00:21:32.291,00:21:40.041,"Tommy, what are you doing? You're really… …freaking me out."
00:21:51.916,00:21:53.666,But I can't save you.
00:21:57.708,00:21:59.041,I saw it on the wall.
00:21:59.541,00:22:02.500,"One way or another, you're gonna die tonight."
00:22:03.750,00:22:05.083,What are you talking about?
00:22:38.875,00:22:41.291,"No grudge. No, we barely ever talked."
00:22:41.375,00:22:44.166,I… I go to get bug spray from her. That's it.
00:22:44.250,00:22:46.375,It just doesn't… it doesn't make any sense.
00:22:46.875,00:22:49.250,Why… why would she do something like this?
00:22:49.916,00:22:53.375,"-She was nuts, just like her kid. -Nurse Lane, she never seemed crazy."
00:22:53.458,00:22:57.208,"That's what she said about her kid, but sane people don't chop up their friends."
00:22:57.791,00:22:59.416,"Now, tell me again what happened."
00:23:03.750,00:23:05.708,"Hey, witch. So sorry."
00:23:06.333,00:23:08.500,I know you and Nurse Psycho were close.
00:23:09.083,00:23:11.500,"-You can visit her in jail now. -Fuck off, Sheila."
00:23:12.791,00:23:16.000,"By the way, you might want to check your stuff."
00:23:16.583,00:23:18.958,I think there was an accident in cabin five.
00:23:28.083,00:23:29.333,Officer Kapinski.
00:23:30.375,00:23:33.708,Been meaning to say I'm sorry about your Pops. He was a good man.
00:23:34.583,00:23:36.833,He was a great man. Taken too soon.
00:23:36.916,00:23:39.541,Thank you. Yeah. We all miss him. Big boots to fill.
00:23:40.541,00:23:44.041,"Well, he was at peace, knowing one day you'd be following in his footsteps."
00:23:44.125,00:23:46.125,Sheriff Nick Goode's got a good ring to it.
00:23:46.208,00:23:49.083,"You just go easy on me when you're my boss, huh?"
00:24:01.708,00:24:03.041,But I can't save you.
00:24:04.833,00:24:08.208,"One way or another, you're gonna die tonight."
00:24:22.666,00:24:26.500,She was clearly possessed… just like her crazy daughter.
00:24:26.583,00:24:28.125,Sarah Fier strikes again.
00:24:31.208,00:24:33.625,-Is Color War gonna be canceled? -It starts tonight.
00:24:33.708,00:24:36.958,Psycho Shadysiders always fucking ruin everything!
00:24:37.041,00:24:40.000,"She said one way or another, I was gonna die tonight."
00:24:40.583,00:24:42.166,Spooky!
00:24:42.250,00:24:45.958,"The kiddos are right. That's, like, totally witchy behavior."
00:24:46.041,00:24:50.166,"It's just, there must be some explanation. The witch isn't real."
00:24:50.250,00:24:56.583,"-Like what? -Well, maybe… Maybe she was on something."
00:25:00.000,00:25:02.791,I'm not talking about marijuana.
00:25:02.875,00:25:07.750,Just admit you're jealous that the witch wanted your hubby all to herself!
00:25:07.833,00:25:11.375,"Be serious, man. Why would Nurse Mary wanna do something like that?"
00:25:11.458,00:25:14.500,"-Why would she want me dead? -Oh, no. She wouldn't."
00:25:18.291,00:25:20.708,"Hey, they're just playing around."
00:25:21.500,00:25:23.000,"This was nothing, I promise."
00:25:23.083,00:25:24.416,Did you see her eyes?
00:25:25.375,00:25:28.083,"There was something in there, something wrong."
00:25:36.250,00:25:43.041,"We had a scary situation earlier, but we cannot let that mess with the most important night of our summer."
00:25:44.083,00:25:47.833,Tonight is Sunnyvale versus Shadyside.
00:25:47.916,00:25:51.583,It is red versus blue. It is good versus evil.
00:25:52.416,00:25:56.166,"Tonight, we commencicate Color War!"
00:25:59.125,00:26:03.166,"He might be dumb, but he's kind of shagadelic."
00:26:03.250,00:26:06.375,-Oh yeah! -He's disgusting. You're disgusting.
00:26:06.458,00:26:10.541,"Tonight's first event is Capture the Flag, baby."
00:26:20.416,00:26:24.625,So let's not let tonight be a stain on our legacy.
00:26:27.500,00:26:36.041,like our ancestors before us and murder those Shadyside witches!
00:26:43.083,00:26:45.625,"Thank you, Kurt, for that neat-o speech."
00:26:46.375,00:26:59.250,"Now, Shadysiders, let's go out there and do our best, because even if we lose, we're still winners in our hearts."
00:26:59.333,00:27:00.750,Boo!
00:27:15.833,00:27:16.833,What are you doing?
00:27:17.958,00:27:19.125,Art project.
00:27:19.208,00:27:21.500,-I need to talk to you. -I'm not in the mood.
00:27:21.583,00:27:23.875,"Earlier, you said Mary was upset."
00:27:26.958,00:27:29.583,"It was serious earlier, and you didn't give a shit."
00:27:32.208,00:27:35.583,"Come on, you were the last person to see her before she snapped."
00:27:36.500,00:27:38.625,What about drugs? Did you see any around?
00:27:39.208,00:27:40.833,"She's a nurse, so yup."
00:27:40.916,00:27:43.750,"-Well, did she mention anything or-- -Nope."
00:27:43.833,00:27:46.958,"Ziggy, I'm just… I'm trying to understand what happened today."
00:27:53.666,00:27:57.125,It's just a big joke to everyone. Mary was possessed by the witch.
00:27:57.208,00:28:02.875,-Maybe it was the witch. -Ziggy… What? That doesn't fit your carefully constructed bullshit view of the world?
00:28:02.958,00:28:04.750,-Why are you being like this? -I dunno.
00:28:04.833,00:28:11.208,"Maybe because Nurse Lane was the only person who was nice to me, and now her life is over because bad things always happen to Shadysiders."
00:28:11.291,00:28:13.541,Nothing just happens. There's always a reason.
00:28:13.625,00:28:17.000,"Not always a rational one. Deep down, you feel it, don't you?"
00:28:17.083,00:28:21.708,"Shadyside, there's something here. It's just holding us down, cursing us."
00:28:21.791,00:28:24.375,"-Ziggy, that's enough. -You're too scared to admit it."
00:28:24.875,00:28:27.166,"When things go bad, you wanna explain it away."
00:28:27.250,00:28:31.041,I'm sorry. I'm not going to blame everything on some fairy tale.
00:28:31.125,00:28:36.458,"Life sucks sometimes. I get that. I mean, God knows it's been hard since… Since what?"
00:28:36.541,00:28:38.416,"See, you can't even say it!"
00:28:38.500,00:28:39.958,Since Dad left.
00:28:40.500,00:28:41.875,Since Mom started drinking.
00:28:41.958,00:28:43.791,Since we're going to lose the house.
00:28:43.875,00:28:45.875,And it's not gonna magically get better.
00:28:46.458,00:28:51.541,And saving up all summer to buy a super cute polo shirt can't hide that.
00:28:52.625,00:28:57.583,Trying to explain why nice old Nurse Lane almost lost it today can't either.
00:28:57.666,00:28:59.083,We're all cursed.
00:28:59.875,00:29:01.250,"For Mary, it was today."
00:29:02.208,00:29:04.416,"But someday, it'll be you."
00:29:04.500,00:29:09.500,"And this whole fake bullshit life of yours, it's gonna come crashing down."
00:29:09.583,00:29:11.583,That's a horrible thing to say.
00:29:12.375,00:29:13.833,It's not horrible if it's true.
00:29:15.583,00:29:20.916,"I don't know who you are anymore, but… But you're not my sister."
00:29:21.875,00:29:22.791,Then who am I?
00:29:23.458,00:29:24.458,A monster.
00:29:29.541,00:29:30.791,That's what they say.
00:29:59.333,00:30:04.541,Do… do not let them anywhere near this. Do you hear me?
00:30:17.958,00:30:21.916,"Now remember, keep at least three defenders by this all the time."
00:30:22.000,00:30:23.625,Alright? And who's the jailer?
00:30:23.708,00:30:40.875,"OK, Jeremy, you may be the most important player in the, uh… in the… -Sunnyvale! -Are you OK?"
00:30:40.958,00:30:42.500,"Yeah, are you OK, Mr. Slater?"
00:30:43.458,00:30:47.750,"Yeah, I'm… I'm good. Um… Why don't you guys get started? Plant the flag."
00:30:47.833,00:30:51.500,"And I'll be right behind you. OK? Let's go, Shadyside! Come on!"
00:30:52.916,00:30:54.125,"Move, move, move!"
00:30:54.208,00:30:55.250,"Oh, man."
00:30:56.333,00:30:59.541,My head is throbbing. She must have got me pretty good.
00:31:00.125,00:31:03.291,-Mary's stronger than she looks. -You need to lie down?
00:31:03.375,00:31:06.125,"No. No, I'm alright. I'm alright."
00:31:06.208,00:31:09.958,"Good. I need your help, and the key to the infirmary."
00:31:40.000,00:31:40.916,Answers.
00:31:41.750,00:31:44.083,"Come on, Cindy. It doesn't matter, alright?"
00:31:44.166,00:31:45.625,It matters.
00:31:45.708,00:31:48.500,There's a reason Mary did what she did and said what she said.
00:31:48.583,00:32:05.791,"-We're going to figure it out now. -Come on, Cindy. Please, I… No label, half-empty."
00:32:06.666,00:32:08.500,"Like I said, she was on drugs."
00:32:09.791,00:32:14.916,"Get these to the cops, then they'll tell us what they… What is that?"
00:32:15.416,00:32:17.708,A deal was made with the Devil.
00:32:18.875,00:32:31.416,"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand on Satan's stone in exchange for eternal life, scarring the soil beneath with the witch's mark, bringing Darkness upon the land."
00:32:37.208,00:32:38.416,Did you hear that?
00:32:52.625,00:32:54.291,"Hello, is somebody in there?"
00:32:57.375,00:32:58.916,-Argh! -Jeez!
00:33:02.166,00:33:04.791,Alice? What are you doing here?
00:33:09.250,00:33:11.291,Must really want me to scrub those toilets.
00:33:11.375,00:33:12.666,This isn't for you.
00:33:12.750,00:33:15.833,"Whoa, Berman. I didn't know you were into that kind of thing."
00:33:15.916,00:33:19.000,They're not for me. I'm giving them to the cops.
00:33:19.083,00:33:20.250,"Oh yeah, the cops."
00:33:20.750,00:33:22.250,"Yeah, right, of course."
00:33:22.333,00:33:26.541,"No, what are you talking about? What, now you're gonna snitch on Mary too?"
00:33:27.125,00:33:31.125,No. That's… I'm trying to-- -This for the cops too? -Give that back!
00:33:36.458,00:33:39.833,"one hand severed, lost forever."
00:33:39.916,00:33:48.791,"We hanged the witch, body chained and buried but without her hand, her grip on the land holds firm."
00:33:50.833,00:33:52.500,This is Sarah Fier shit!
00:33:52.583,00:33:54.708,"Alice, come on."
00:33:54.791,00:34:02.250,"When she is near, blood will fall and the curse will last until body and hand unite."
00:34:02.333,00:34:05.291,"Alice, it's Mary's diary. Let's put it back."
00:34:05.875,00:34:07.000,It's not just a diary.
00:34:09.875,00:34:10.958,It's a map.
00:34:11.541,00:34:12.500,What?
00:34:12.583,00:34:15.416,Crazy Nurse Lane made a crazy map.
00:34:19.250,00:34:22.250,"It's camp, but looks like she drew all over it."
00:34:23.833,00:34:26.208,1666 Union.
00:34:26.291,00:34:28.416,"-Union, that's Shadyside. -What?"
00:34:28.500,00:34:31.875,The settlement before it was divided into Shadyside and Sunnyvale.
00:34:31.958,00:34:37.208,"-Really? -If you went to class… So, the camp is built in the same place as the settlement?"
00:34:38.541,00:34:40.750,"Whoa, look, look, look! Sarah Fier!"
00:34:44.750,00:34:46.416,There's only one way to find out.
00:34:48.291,00:34:49.583,Hey! That's my bag!
00:34:49.666,00:34:50.666,"Arnie, flashlight."
00:34:53.500,00:34:55.375,-What is this shit? -Let me see.
00:34:57.958,00:34:59.041,L484.
00:35:00.208,00:35:03.166,"-Sounds familiar. Ooh, Dex, maybe. -Know what sounds fun?"
00:35:04.041,00:35:06.708,"-Seeing a witch's house high on Dex. -Oh yes, it does."
00:35:06.791,00:35:10.458,Alice! Bring that back! What are you doing?
00:35:10.541,00:35:14.083,"It's called fun, Cindy Berman. You used to have it, remember?"
00:35:21.541,00:35:23.541,"Come on, they took everything!"
00:35:34.750,00:35:35.916,"Go away, Cindy!"
00:35:36.458,00:35:37.875,It's me. It's Nick.
00:35:39.541,00:35:40.875,"Go away, Nick!"
00:35:42.541,00:35:43.375,Whoa.
00:35:45.166,00:35:47.833,-I like what you've done with the place. -This wasn't me.
00:35:49.000,00:35:51.583,Ziggy is a witch bitch.
00:35:51.666,00:35:54.875,Ziggy sucks cocks in Hell. Jeez.
00:35:56.166,00:35:57.083,Sheila?
00:35:57.708,00:35:58.625,Colonel Mustard.
00:36:00.541,00:36:06.458,"-Oh, looks like blood. -Yeah. I didn't have a pig, so… Carrie. Cool."
00:36:08.375,00:36:09.375,You've read Carrie?
00:36:09.458,00:36:11.916,Yeah. Second favorite after Salem's Lot.
00:36:13.708,00:36:16.833,"Still, I dunno, paint seems a little pedestrian."
00:36:16.916,00:36:18.916,"Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have a better idea?"
00:36:19.000,00:36:20.416,Maybe.
00:36:20.500,00:36:22.875,"Shouldn't you be, like, turning me in or something?"
00:36:22.958,00:36:31.333,"Well, I should be supervising Color War, uh… -But noticed you were MIA and-- -So you decided to stalk me."
00:36:32.000,00:36:33.166,Check in on you.
00:36:33.750,00:36:37.208,Clearly you don't need my assistance. All good. Go ahead.
00:36:37.291,00:36:38.375,Carrie on.
00:36:42.833,00:36:43.875,What's your idea?
00:36:47.583,00:36:48.541,Science &amp; Nature.
00:36:52.541,00:36:53.541,Alice!
00:36:54.166,00:36:57.000,"Come on, it's disgusting in here!"
00:37:01.125,00:37:03.125,This was the best idea.
00:37:04.125,00:37:06.166,"Yeah, but I still don't feel shit."
00:37:06.875,00:37:08.708,"OK, so, take more."
00:37:09.416,00:37:10.416,Thank you.
00:37:12.083,00:37:13.083,L484.
00:37:21.625,00:37:22.541,Shit!
00:37:22.625,00:37:25.000,"-Oh, it's ruined now! -You cursed again."
00:37:26.291,00:37:27.833,You want me to murder you?
00:37:47.666,00:37:48.583,Watch your step.
00:38:00.291,00:38:01.375,Mary.
00:38:02.666,00:38:07.500,"Hey, where's the, uh… The X's, look. Look."
00:38:11.250,00:38:13.583,"Look, here. Here."
00:38:13.666,00:38:15.166,She was marking where she dug.
00:38:19.875,00:38:26.041,her grip on the land holds firm and the curse will last until body and hand unite.
00:38:26.125,00:38:28.708,Maybe Mary was looking for the hand.
00:38:30.958,00:38:33.958,-To end the curse? -That made her daughter lose her mind.
00:38:34.041,00:38:35.083,"Guys, come on."
00:38:38.000,00:38:39.083,I gotta piss.
00:38:40.625,00:38:41.791,"Hey, let me see that."
00:38:43.166,00:38:45.916,"You can have it, but first give me the drugs."
00:38:48.416,00:39:00.750,"L484, L4… If Nurse Mary took them and went crazy, those drugs are very dangerous."
00:39:03.750,00:39:05.291,What happened to you?
00:39:05.375,00:39:08.291,You remember when we used to have fun?
00:39:09.083,00:39:11.916,-Before you became a snitch? -Just let it go already.
00:39:12.000,00:39:13.375,That's easy for you to say.
00:39:18.666,00:39:20.000,I found the witch's house.
00:39:24.333,00:39:30.083,"Dude… Was I the only one expecting, like, I dunno, a house made out of candy?"
00:39:48.750,00:39:50.333,We're high and hungry.
00:39:51.500,00:39:54.041,"-Sarah Fier! -OK, we've seen enough."
00:39:54.125,00:39:55.958,"Alright then, go home, Berman."
00:39:56.500,00:39:59.166,"I didn't march all the way out here for nothing, OK?"
00:40:05.250,00:40:06.458,Alice!
00:40:18.125,00:40:19.333,"Like, recently."
00:40:33.750,00:40:35.208,It's Sarah Fier!
00:40:35.291,00:40:36.750,Sarah Fier isn't real.
00:40:37.750,00:40:39.708,"Well, someone lit that candle."
00:40:45.041,00:40:48.000,"Hey, Sarah Fier, if you're in here, say something!"
00:40:50.166,00:40:51.583,Maybe she's shy.
00:40:55.833,00:40:58.166,Ali… Alice! God!
00:41:04.875,00:41:06.041,Whoa!
00:41:08.791,00:41:14.833,"It's some kind of, like, occult thing… Like Devil worship."
00:41:22.208,00:41:23.250,The what?
00:41:29.458,00:41:41.083,"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand on Satan's stone in exchange for eternal life, scarring the soil beneath with the witch's mark, bringing Darkness upon the land."
00:41:42.750,00:41:44.125,It's acetaminophen.
00:41:47.791,00:41:51.125,It just hit me. It's fucking Tylenol. It's nothing.
00:41:51.208,00:41:52.375,Are you sure?
00:41:52.458,00:41:53.458,Positive.
00:41:58.583,00:42:01.833,Pretty sure Joan might still have some weed if we pay her.
00:42:17.833,00:42:19.250,"Let's go, man."
00:42:20.958,00:42:22.416,"Hey, you alright, man?"
00:42:24.000,00:42:25.000,Hello?
00:42:52.583,00:42:56.916,-I need to show you something. -This place… -It keeps on going. -Now!
00:43:03.791,00:43:05.625,Billy Barker. Ruby Lane.
00:43:06.125,00:43:07.750,-Mary's daughter. -Yeah.
00:43:08.250,00:43:09.708,"Isaac Milton, Harry Rooker."
00:43:09.791,00:43:12.250,You don't have to go to fucking class to know those names.
00:43:12.750,00:43:14.333,-The Shadyside Killers. -Yeah.
00:43:15.958,00:43:16.958,Except one.
00:43:23.041,00:43:25.500,"Tommy? Alice, this isn't funny."
00:43:25.583,00:43:29.916,"What, you think I carved your boyfriend's name into solid stone with my fingernails?"
00:43:30.416,00:43:31.916,Someone else did this.
00:43:58.250,00:44:09.625,"What the hell are you doing, man? Tommy… Tommy, stop!"
00:44:20.166,00:44:21.291,Here.
00:44:21.791,00:44:22.916,Help me.
00:44:28.833,00:44:30.333,"Go, go, go!"
00:44:39.083,00:44:40.708,No! No!
00:45:08.000,00:45:09.166,Do you hear that?
00:45:12.750,00:45:14.041,He's still alive?
00:45:15.375,00:45:16.750,He can't… He can't get us.
00:45:20.958,00:45:22.125,He can't get us.
00:45:56.666,00:45:59.666,"You move, you speak, you fucking die!"
00:45:59.750,00:46:00.750,Go!
00:46:02.958,00:46:03.791,From Will.
00:46:35.708,00:46:38.833,Will! This is too cute.
00:46:38.916,00:46:42.041,"Could have done it in your bunk, but I guess this is kind of hot."
00:47:04.458,00:47:07.000,Please somebody help me!
00:47:07.833,00:47:09.916,Help me! Somebody help me! Please!
00:47:17.708,00:47:20.083,-Did you hear her? -She sounded like a frog.
00:47:23.500,00:47:24.583,Fuck paint.
00:47:26.875,00:47:27.916,Who are you?
00:47:28.625,00:47:29.625,Nick Goode.
00:47:32.583,00:47:33.750,Nice to meet you.
00:47:36.958,00:47:41.958,I don't know. It seems to just… go on forever.
00:47:50.750,00:47:51.916,help me?
00:47:52.000,00:47:55.083,"What, you're just gonna pretend that everything's OK?"
00:47:57.250,00:48:04.541,"Alice, I just… Tommy split Arnie's head in half."
00:48:05.875,00:48:07.208,Do you realize that?
00:48:11.541,00:48:14.916,"This shit weighs, like, a million pounds. I thought you got an A in physics."
00:48:15.000,00:48:16.375,We have to get out!
00:48:16.458,00:48:17.625,"Well, tough shit."
00:48:18.125,00:48:19.541,Because we can't.
00:48:20.125,00:48:22.041,We're gonna die down here.
00:48:23.125,00:48:24.041,Just like Arnie.
00:48:29.000,00:48:30.666,"No, no. We have to get out!"
00:48:30.750,00:48:31.875,We have to!
00:48:31.958,00:48:35.416,"Those names on the wall, they didn't stop with one murder."
00:48:36.416,00:48:38.833,"Seven, nine, ten, fifteen people."
00:48:38.916,00:48:40.458,Those were serial killers.
00:48:40.541,00:48:45.583,"The campers… My… my sister, they're up there."
00:48:47.250,00:48:48.541,"And now, so is he."
00:48:49.416,00:48:51.458,I thought you didn't believe in the witch.
00:48:51.541,00:48:56.208,"Yeah, I don't! I… The… There must be some… some explanation."
00:48:59.041,00:49:00.416,He was possessed!
00:49:00.500,00:49:03.125,-Maybe… Maybe he took a pill or-- -No!
00:49:03.208,00:49:06.208,"No! Cindy, no! It wasn't the fucking Tylenol, alright?"
00:49:06.791,00:49:07.916,It was the witch.
00:49:08.500,00:49:10.083,"Alright, you saw those names."
00:49:10.166,00:49:14.208,"And that… that ritual, the witch is real."
00:49:14.875,00:49:19.791,And she's doing some… some fucking spell shit and possessing people.
00:49:19.875,00:49:21.833,OK? Every name on that rock.
00:49:22.916,00:49:24.541,"And Mary knew it, alright?"
00:49:25.041,00:49:26.916,She knew it. And it's all right here.
00:49:27.000,00:49:28.583,This isn't real!
00:49:30.583,00:49:32.000,You want an explanation?
00:49:32.708,00:49:34.333,"Well, here it is. OK?"
00:49:34.416,00:49:38.958,"She looked for the hand bone to fucking stop the curse, to save Shadyside, but she couldn't find it."
00:49:39.041,00:49:40.625,Wanna know what she did find?
00:49:41.208,00:49:43.916,Your boyfriend's name in that fucking wall.
00:49:44.916,00:49:47.458,-So she tried to kill him. -Stop.
00:49:47.541,00:49:55.833,"Which I also would've done, if I knew there was a chance that Tommy fucking Slater would ax my boyfriend in the fucking head!"
00:49:55.916,00:49:57.708,Listen! Shut up!
00:50:01.541,00:50:03.125,That's the Cindy Berman I knew.
00:50:05.375,00:50:06.833,"Hey, where are you going?"
00:50:06.916,00:50:08.375,To find another way out.
00:50:09.166,00:50:10.166,Don't follow me.
00:50:10.750,00:50:12.291,"Don't come back here, alright?"
00:50:28.916,00:50:30.750,"You're fine, you're fine."
00:50:37.125,00:50:40.916,"Jesus, what the hell? I told you not to follow me."
00:50:41.000,00:50:42.333,"Yeah, I didn't."
00:50:42.916,00:50:44.416,You went in a circle.
00:50:45.541,00:50:47.166,Fucking circle.
00:51:02.416,00:51:04.916,"One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four."
00:51:05.000,00:51:06.750,"One, two, three, four."
00:51:06.833,00:51:08.666,-What are you doing? -Four.
00:51:08.750,00:51:11.750,"This symbol, it branches off here. Four times."
00:51:12.291,00:51:14.375,"Three there, one there."
00:51:14.458,00:51:15.916,Just like this cave.
00:51:16.000,00:51:17.208,It's the same.
00:51:18.125,00:51:23.416,"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand on Satan's stone, scarring the soil beneath with the witch's mark."
00:51:24.250,00:51:25.791,Scarring the soil.
00:51:26.500,00:51:29.208,"So, what, like, the witch made this fucking place?"
00:51:29.291,00:51:31.791,Or the settlers claimed she did. It doesn't matter.
00:51:31.875,00:51:34.666,-All that matters is this symbol. It's a-- -It's a map.
00:51:45.875,00:51:49.833,"Can I, uh… get you a water or a juice box maybe?"
00:51:49.916,00:51:50.750,We're fine.
00:51:51.333,00:52:03.250,"Cool. Yeah, I just thought, you know, since we're all in here and in jail that you might want some refreshments, but, uh… Or we can, uh… We can… We can… Well, we can play a game."
00:52:03.333,00:52:06.500,"Do you guys like, uh, Charades-- Shut the fuck up, nerd."
00:52:08.041,00:52:35.500,"Yeah, OK. Sure. Um… these inmates are property of Shadyside."
00:52:36.125,00:52:40.458,"If you… If you don't leave, I… I'll be forced to get you."
00:53:09.375,00:53:10.333,Tommy?
00:53:19.458,00:53:21.583,"Alright, next question."
00:53:24.333,00:53:27.291,What about you and your sister? You guys ever get along?
00:53:27.791,00:53:29.958,Thought these were supposed to be easy questions.
00:53:31.000,00:53:33.291,There are no rules to this game.
00:53:34.458,00:53:35.458,"God, I hate snakes."
00:53:35.541,00:53:37.208,Why are you dodging my question?
00:53:37.791,00:53:38.958,Why do you care?
00:53:39.041,00:53:40.083,I'm curious.
00:53:45.250,00:53:47.875,Why are you so full of shit?
00:53:49.083,00:53:56.375,"Nick Goode, heir apparent, Daddy was the police chief, the King of Sunnyvale, you're gonna be the same."
00:53:56.458,00:53:58.083,Except it's all make-believe.
00:53:59.458,00:54:07.291,The truth is you like Stephen King and spiders and… the weird girl from Shadyside.
00:54:07.791,00:54:12.666,"Alright, first of all, Stephen King is, like, super popular."
00:54:13.250,00:54:17.375,"And, second, I can't like the weird girl."
00:54:17.458,00:54:18.750,Why not?
00:54:19.541,00:54:21.000,Because I'm a counselor.
00:54:21.083,00:54:22.333,She's a camper.
00:54:22.416,00:54:24.458,Last year for me. First year for you.
00:54:24.541,00:54:29.833,"Plus, how will I ever get to know her when she keeps dodging my questions?"
00:54:41.458,00:54:44.000,There was a time when things were good between us.
00:54:44.083,00:55:02.791,"When my dad was around and my mom was happy, and my sister and me, we would, um… we'd throw toilet paper on Mr. Corkle's tree, and then go jump in the lake in all our clothes and… And now… Now it's just gone and everything's shit."
00:55:05.416,00:55:07.541,That's what happens when you live in Shadyside.
00:55:08.041,00:55:10.083,Everything turns to shit eventually.
00:55:13.500,00:55:16.333,But I wouldn't expect a Sunnyvaler to understand.
00:55:17.833,00:55:19.458,"No, maybe you're right."
00:55:20.125,00:55:23.833,"But, uh… being the heir apparent isn't always easy either."
00:55:24.708,00:55:34.083,"Before he died, my dad loaded me up with all this, you know, You're my legacy, the future of the family depends on you shit."
00:55:35.291,00:55:41.875,"You know, he just dropped this huge burden in my lap and… I dunno, what if I don't want that?"
00:55:41.958,00:55:43.958,What if that's not who I want to be?
00:55:44.041,00:55:51.625,What if I want to be the kid who likes spiders and Stephen King and-- And the weird girl from Shadyside?
00:55:54.458,00:55:55.375,Yeah.
00:55:57.708,00:55:59.291,The weird girl from Shadyside.
00:56:02.833,00:56:05.041,I guess there's nothing I can do about it.
00:56:05.541,00:56:06.500,Why not?
00:56:09.833,00:56:13.375,"Yeah, you were right. Can we, uh… Can we go back to the easy questions?"
00:56:14.750,00:56:15.791,OK.
00:56:18.583,00:56:51.541,"Um… How about… We're done. Everyone get back. Hey, no! Color War's done! Alright?"
00:56:56.833,00:57:00.625,"Alright, it branches off again here. Just stay left."
00:57:02.125,00:57:05.041,I cannot believe this is working.
00:57:05.916,00:57:08.708,It's taking too long. He could be back at camp already.
00:57:10.958,00:57:13.916,If you have to kill him… could you?
00:57:14.708,00:57:22.125,"Earlier, when Mary attacked, I just… I froze. I couldn't do anything."
00:57:25.875,00:57:29.958,"So, no, I… I couldn't kill anyone, much less Tommy."
00:57:31.208,00:57:33.875,"Well, good news. I would happily kill him."
00:57:34.500,00:57:38.708,"God, even now, after everything, you're… you're still a jerk."
00:57:42.625,00:57:45.791,And that was before the witch possessed him.
00:57:48.708,00:57:50.083,Tommy was sweet.
00:57:51.041,00:57:55.916,He made me feel like everything was going to be OK.
00:57:56.708,00:57:58.208,I loved him.
00:57:58.291,00:57:59.708,I really did.
00:58:08.541,00:58:09.666,Do you hear that?
00:58:11.000,00:58:13.000,There's this space here up ahead.
00:58:13.833,00:58:16.083,All roads lead here.
00:58:18.791,00:58:20.583,Is there any other way around?
00:58:33.000,00:58:34.750,Flies? What is this stuff?
00:58:34.833,00:58:36.000,It's everywhere.
00:58:38.958,00:58:39.916,Cindy?
00:58:41.916,00:58:43.083,What is that?
00:58:49.958,00:58:51.291,Let's get out of here.
00:59:42.125,00:59:45.666,"Let's go! This is not part of the game! Go, guys! Go, go!"
00:59:45.750,00:59:58.916,"Five, seven, eight, ten, fifteen, eighteen… -Twenty-three. -That's 30 missing at least."
00:59:59.000,01:00:01.833,"-Where's Cindy, Kurt, Joan? -I don't know. I haven't seen them."
01:00:01.916,01:00:03.375,Or Tommy or anyone.
01:00:08.583,01:00:11.875,"-I'm sure they heard the bell. Hey! -My sister, she's still out there!"
01:00:11.958,01:00:14.250,The same sister you've hated since you were a baby?
01:00:14.333,01:00:16.375,"Look, I'm sorry."
01:00:16.458,01:00:19.125,I didn't mean it. Me and Gary will go.
01:00:19.625,01:00:21.166,-What? -Just please stay here.
01:00:21.250,01:00:23.458,-I can't sit here! -I'm not letting you get hurt!
01:00:27.208,01:00:30.125,"Please, let me do my job."
01:00:30.208,01:00:33.250,I'm gonna find your sister. Just stay here. OK?
01:00:35.250,01:00:38.291,"-You. -Hey, you realize that's a camper, right?"
01:00:38.375,01:00:41.166,"Look, you make for cabin one. I'll head to nine."
01:00:41.250,01:00:44.458,"-What if the killer's still out there? -That's the whole point, Gary."
01:00:45.625,01:00:49.625,"Hey, everybody! Stay here! OK? OK."
01:00:52.541,01:00:53.375,Hey!
01:00:54.500,01:00:57.416,"-Where is she, witch? -You kill her like you killed Jeremy?"
01:00:57.500,01:00:59.083,-What are you talking about? -Sheila!
01:00:59.166,01:01:00.250,Where the fuck is Sheila?
01:01:02.041,01:01:02.875,Shit!
01:01:04.708,01:01:07.458,"Nick! Nick, we forgot Sheila!"
01:01:09.875,01:01:10.958,Shit!
01:01:16.833,01:01:17.833,Cindy!
01:01:18.333,01:01:19.333,Kurt!
01:01:21.333,01:01:22.250,Alice!
01:01:23.250,01:01:24.208,Joan!
01:01:25.791,01:01:27.000,Fuck.
01:01:27.083,01:01:29.250,Where the fuck is everyone?
01:01:34.291,01:01:36.416,"Stay put, big boy."
01:01:49.250,01:01:52.625,"You tell anyone about this, and you're dead."
01:01:53.791,01:01:55.541,-You hear me? -Yeah.
01:01:59.458,01:02:02.083,Just admit that Shadysiders do it better.
01:02:04.958,01:02:06.166,He knows.
01:02:34.208,01:02:37.041,"You know, you Sunnyvalers are really missing out."
01:02:38.541,01:02:43.250,"This shit, like, really… opens up your mind."
01:03:19.583,01:03:21.416,Okie dokie!
01:03:23.500,01:03:24.333,Tommy!
01:03:37.625,01:03:38.583,Jesus!
01:03:40.083,01:03:41.458,"I was there, in the past."
01:03:41.541,01:03:43.958,-You're OK. -I saw the… the killers.
01:03:44.041,01:03:46.250,They killed so many and you're next.
01:03:46.333,01:03:47.875,You're fucking next!
01:03:47.958,01:03:50.916,"No, no, no, no. That's not true. I'm right here."
01:03:51.000,01:03:52.333,The witch did this.
01:03:53.166,01:03:56.458,She did all of this. She put a curse on Shadyside. Mary was right.
01:03:56.541,01:03:57.500,I know.
01:03:58.000,01:04:00.208,"The cave was alive, Alice."
01:04:01.791,01:04:03.125,Tylenol can't do that.
01:04:11.791,01:04:12.791,I am a snitch.
01:04:13.916,01:04:19.375,"The day after we stole Mr. Evans's JVC player, Harold Hines saw me with it."
01:04:19.458,01:04:21.000,Fucking Harold Hines.
01:04:23.916,01:04:33.208,"Next thing I know, I'm in the Principal's office, and my dad can't come in because he just ran off with some girl not much older than I am now."
01:04:33.291,01:04:38.250,"And my mom, well, she was having a few drinks at O'Connell's."
01:04:38.333,01:04:43.250,And I knew then… I wasn't different from the other Shadysiders.
01:04:44.458,01:04:45.750,I was cursed.
01:04:47.333,01:04:52.916,"I told myself if I was perfect, if I did everything right, I could beat it."
01:04:53.666,01:05:00.500,"I snitched on you, I got new friends, I… started dressing like this."
01:05:05.833,01:05:07.333,I dated sweet Tommy.
01:05:09.125,01:05:12.916,"I avoided you, but I couldn't avoid Ziggy."
01:05:16.083,01:05:19.125,"Because she was always there, reminding me of the truth."
01:05:23.166,01:05:24.166,…was cursed.
01:05:26.083,01:05:27.583,And so were we.
01:05:28.833,01:05:29.875,Now I know.
01:05:30.625,01:05:35.916,She was right… all this time.
01:05:42.916,01:05:44.250,I've been a bad friend.
01:05:46.833,01:05:51.750,"I should've just… skipped class, partied, had sex, had fun."
01:05:54.291,01:06:00.958,but the fun… it's not any more real than your polo shirt.
01:06:01.458,01:06:02.833,There's a reason I wear these.
01:06:04.708,01:06:06.916,And it's not just because they're awesome.
01:06:27.666,01:06:28.541,This.
01:06:28.625,01:06:31.791,"This moss, it stained my shirt. The outhouse!"
01:06:36.791,01:06:39.250,This stuff is all over the outhouse.
01:06:41.583,01:06:42.708,Camp.
01:06:44.833,01:06:46.250,It means we're close.
01:06:47.291,01:06:50.208,"Everyone, listen up! The game is over!"
01:06:50.791,01:06:53.791,Get back to the Mess Hall or I'll dock you a victory point!
01:06:57.625,01:06:59.250,Claire! Freddy! Jesus!
01:06:59.958,01:07:02.500,Get to the Mess Hall! Come on! Go!
01:07:09.250,01:07:10.750,"Everyone, the game is over!"
01:07:13.875,01:07:15.083,Was that Counselor Goode?
01:07:15.166,01:07:16.791,Hey! I said no talking!
01:07:17.541,01:07:20.000,"-He said the game was over! -No talking, dweeb!"
01:07:20.666,01:07:23.500,Just stay put. I'll check with Counselor Goode.
01:07:23.583,01:07:26.375,"Hey, we need… that."
01:07:38.000,01:07:39.375,Maybe we should just leave.
01:07:51.250,01:07:52.416,Counselor Tommy?
01:08:12.458,01:08:13.666,Oh shit!
01:08:21.708,01:08:22.958,Sheila?
01:08:23.958,01:08:25.500,"Sheila, are you still in here?"
01:08:26.208,01:08:27.333,Sheila?
01:08:32.208,01:08:34.375,Sheila! Listen to me!
01:08:38.083,01:08:39.250,Do you smell that?
01:08:41.750,01:08:43.166,It smells like shit.
01:09:05.125,01:09:14.916,I'm trying to help you! There's a killer-- -What's going on in here? -Is everyone OK?
01:09:15.000,01:09:16.958,No! Everyone's headed back to the Mess Hall.
01:09:17.041,01:09:18.041,Where's Nick?
01:09:22.250,01:09:23.166,Do you hear that?
01:09:30.416,01:09:33.416,"-Please, help us! -Get us out of here!"
01:09:37.791,01:09:38.750,Cindy?
01:09:38.833,01:09:41.000,Ziggy? Oh my God!
01:09:47.333,01:09:48.500,"Yeah, hold on a second."
01:09:48.583,01:09:50.750,"Ziggy, are you OK?"
01:09:54.125,01:09:55.208,What is going on?
01:09:55.291,01:09:57.625,-My sister's in the toilet. -What?
01:09:57.708,01:09:58.875,Gary! Just help me!
01:09:59.458,01:10:02.833,"Come on! Go! Back to the Mess Hall, you hear me? Let's go!"
01:10:09.500,01:10:11.416,"If anyone's in there, the game's over!"
01:10:24.333,01:10:25.333,Oh God.
01:10:35.000,01:10:36.083,Oh shit!
01:10:43.750,01:10:47.250,"Nick! I came out of the bathroom, she was just dead, man! I swear to God!"
01:10:49.333,01:10:50.500,"Jesus, man."
01:10:51.666,01:10:53.083,Did you do this?
01:10:53.791,01:10:56.958,"-Listen, there's a fucking killer. -What?"
01:10:57.041,01:10:59.958,We have to get the others out of here. Get back to the Mess Hall.
01:11:00.041,01:11:02.166,"In 15 minutes, ring the bell."
01:11:02.250,01:11:03.916,"Ring the bell, that's the signal."
01:11:04.000,01:11:06.625,"Get them on the bus, get them out of here. Alright?"
01:11:06.708,01:11:07.875,You hear me?
01:11:07.958,01:11:09.625,"Just go! Go, Kurt!"
01:11:33.125,01:11:34.458,Now!
01:11:59.875,01:12:27.041,"Tommy! Tommy, what are you doi… -Ziggy! Ziggy! -Get him off me!"
01:12:33.875,01:12:34.916,What are you doing?
01:12:35.000,01:12:36.708,-He's here! -Come on!
01:12:46.375,01:12:49.416,"-Did we lose him? -Yeah, I think so. Are you OK? You hurt?"
01:12:51.250,01:12:52.916,It's not my blood. It's Gary's.
01:12:54.041,01:12:58.416,"-And yours? -Um… Sean, Jesse, Rod, Stacey."
01:12:58.500,01:13:01.291,Shadysiders. It's the curse.
01:13:01.375,01:13:03.291,"No, it's, uh, it's just some psycho."
01:13:03.375,01:13:06.208,"No, no, it's not some psycho. It's Tommy."
01:13:06.291,01:13:09.916,"My sister's perfect, virgin, boring boyfriend Tommy."
01:13:10.000,01:13:11.000,She did this.
01:13:14.583,01:13:16.000,"That's not real, Ziggy."
01:13:16.083,01:13:18.791,Exactly what Sunnyvaler would say. I thought you were different.
01:13:19.791,01:13:21.875,They're getting on the bus. We have to go!
01:13:21.958,01:13:26.083,"-I can't! My sister is still out there! -Ziggy, I've let a lot of people die."
01:13:26.166,01:13:29.083,"-Nick, this isn't your fault. -Not you! I'm not letting you die."
01:13:30.083,01:13:31.708,"Because, uh… yeah!"
01:13:31.791,01:13:34.041,I do like the weirdo from Shadyside.
01:13:34.125,01:13:38.541,"Maybe once we get out of this, we could, uh… we could start a book club or something."
01:13:38.625,01:13:42.541,"Maybe… I dunno, Stephen King's new one is supposed to be good, I hear."
01:13:43.041,01:13:45.791,I'm done with King. Judy Blume for me from now on.
01:13:46.875,01:13:49.041,"Yeah, Judy Blume sounds, uh… sounds perfect."
01:13:49.958,01:13:52.291,"You believe me, right? About the curse?"
01:13:53.083,01:13:55.375,"Yeah, of course. I am different."
01:13:56.500,01:13:58.875,"Now, come on. We gotta get out of here."
01:13:58.958,01:14:01.541,We'll call the cops. Your sister's gonna be alright.
01:14:01.625,01:14:03.416,"First, we gotta get on that bus."
01:15:44.541,01:15:45.583,Aaah! Run!
01:15:47.291,01:15:48.666,Run!
01:15:58.000,01:15:59.291,Ziggy!
01:16:02.958,01:16:04.833,We have to find another way out.
01:16:05.333,01:16:06.708,What if there's not?
01:16:08.583,01:16:11.250,We're at the outhouse. We're at camp.
01:16:11.833,01:16:14.208,"Come on, get the diary. We're too close."
01:16:17.833,01:16:19.958,"OK, these… these tunnels."
01:16:21.166,01:16:23.125,"The witch, she made them, right?"
01:16:23.208,01:16:24.208,Yeah?
01:16:25.041,01:16:31.625,"And, She emerged by the Meeting House, one hand severed lost forever."
01:16:31.708,01:16:37.666,"The Meeting House, which is now… The Mess Hall."
01:16:38.500,01:16:39.833,There's gotta be another way out.
01:16:40.875,01:16:42.416,Oh God!
01:16:42.500,01:16:43.791,Come on!
01:16:43.875,01:16:45.916,-I'm just gonna slow you down. -Alice!
01:16:46.000,01:16:49.208,"No, it's fine. I'll catch up. You gotta save your sister."
01:16:49.291,01:16:51.083,No… Go!
01:16:59.375,01:17:02.833,Kurt! Will! Anybody!
01:17:39.833,01:17:50.708,"Blood will fall… When she is near, blood will fall."
01:17:51.916,01:17:55.333,Her hand laid to rest atop Satan's stone.
01:18:02.750,01:18:49.166,Satan's stone… Can anyone hear me? Hello?
01:18:52.416,01:18:53.416,Hello?
01:18:54.500,01:18:56.708,Can anyone hear me? Hello!
01:19:19.166,01:19:23.541,"Hey! Hey, I'm over here! Help!"
01:20:52.416,01:20:53.416,Ziggy!
01:20:53.916,01:20:54.916,Ziggy!
01:21:47.208,01:21:48.125,No!
01:21:59.041,01:22:01.250,Fuck… you!
01:22:07.833,01:22:08.833,You swore!
01:22:09.958,01:22:11.291,It's becoming a habit.
01:22:19.208,01:22:20.875,You smell like shit.
01:22:20.958,01:22:23.541,"-Yeah, that's because I'm covered in it. -Oh God."
01:22:25.125,01:22:28.500,-Do you think it'll wash out? -You might need to buy a new polo.
01:22:31.416,01:22:32.875,"I'm so sorry, Ziggy."
01:22:34.125,01:22:38.750,"I'm… I'm sorry I wasn't here, not just tonight, but every day."
01:22:38.833,01:22:44.708,"No, you were. You just-- I know that now."
01:22:45.625,01:22:49.083,"I know that you just needed me to listen, to hear you."
01:22:50.416,01:23:01.625,"I thought if I just put my head down and followed the rules, everything would be fine, that I'd get out of Shadyside, but… but now I know you were right."
01:23:03.625,01:23:05.041,Everything is cursed.
01:23:07.083,01:23:08.500,I could have been nicer.
01:23:09.458,01:23:12.208,I could have been less of a… of a monster.
01:23:12.708,01:23:17.416,Yeah. Well… You were my monster.
01:23:18.500,01:23:29.458,"And at the end of the day, Mom, Dad… Shadyside, Sunnyvale, I… I won't let anything pull us apart again."
01:23:29.541,01:23:30.541,You hear me?
01:24:00.125,01:24:01.166,"Hey, snitch!"
01:24:01.875,01:24:03.416,What took you so long?
01:24:18.666,01:24:19.708,You did it.
01:24:21.166,01:24:22.166,We did it.
01:24:25.583,01:24:28.208,"OK, careful, OK? This thing's like a million years old."
01:24:28.791,01:24:30.166,I bought that a month ago.
01:24:30.250,01:24:32.833,"No, I'm not talking about your stupid bag, genius."
01:24:33.625,01:24:34.708,Blood will fall.
01:24:35.708,01:24:38.083,"Satan's stone, OK? It was right there."
01:24:38.750,01:24:41.750,"All this time, buried under the moss, and I found it."
01:24:42.500,01:24:43.875,I fucking found it.
01:24:43.958,01:24:45.333,Found what?
01:24:46.416,01:24:47.541,Three guesses.
01:24:55.916,01:24:57.916,What? What is it?
01:25:09.000,01:25:11.500,she spent her entire life looking for this.
01:25:12.125,01:25:14.458,A way to stop the curse that took her daughter.
01:25:16.000,01:25:19.583,"Without her hand, her grip on the land holds firm."
01:25:19.666,01:25:25.250,The curse will last until body and hand unite.
01:25:25.333,01:25:27.250,This led us to the hand bone.
01:25:28.000,01:25:32.791,"And if the legend is true, that means her body's still buried-- By the Hanging Tree."
01:25:32.875,01:25:34.166,We can end this.
01:25:34.250,01:25:42.375,"No more murders, no more curse, no more… pain."
01:25:46.333,01:25:50.250,We can save Shadyside… tonight!
01:26:08.708,01:26:12.666,I bled on the hand and… I think I just saw her.
01:26:13.375,01:26:14.291,Who?
01:26:15.333,01:26:16.500,Sarah Fier.
01:26:19.583,01:26:20.833,She was angry.
01:26:21.916,01:26:25.083,We have to bury this thing… right fucking now.
01:27:29.458,01:27:30.916,"What, I have to use my hands?"
01:27:31.416,01:27:32.708,"No, you're staying here."
01:27:32.791,01:27:34.958,"Come on, I can hop just fine."
01:27:41.375,01:27:43.541,I watched my dad go to jail when I was six.
01:27:45.625,01:27:49.250,I watched my mom steal… so I could eat.
01:27:50.416,01:27:52.541,First time I cut myself I was 12.
01:27:52.625,01:27:57.750,"It was after… Well, you know when."
01:27:58.875,01:28:10.583,And now tonight… I watched your perfect boyfriend turn into a monster and kill the only person I've ever loved.
01:28:18.625,01:28:19.833,And now I've found it.
01:28:20.958,01:28:22.583,Let me see this through.
01:28:25.708,01:28:31.583,For Arnie… for Tommy… for Shadyside.
01:28:35.666,01:28:36.708,For Shadyside.
01:28:38.583,01:28:39.541,For Shadyside.
01:28:42.333,01:28:43.291,Alice!
01:28:54.000,01:28:55.375,Fucking die!
01:28:55.458,01:28:59.166,Why won't you fucking die!
01:29:05.375,01:29:06.833,No! Alice?
01:29:07.708,01:29:08.708,Alice?
01:29:09.416,01:29:13.708,"Alice, just… Just stay with me. Alice."
01:29:21.500,01:29:22.500,Alice!
01:29:23.416,01:29:24.541,Alice!
01:29:34.500,01:29:35.541,What is that?
01:30:07.916,01:30:08.833,Help me!
01:30:41.500,01:30:42.791,Just keep digging!
01:31:03.750,01:31:05.833,The witch forever lives.
01:31:05.916,01:31:07.208,The witch forever lives.
01:31:08.500,01:31:11.125,"-Cindy, what does it mean? Cindy? -I don't know."
01:31:11.208,01:31:13.625,-Where is she? Where's the body? -I don't know.
01:31:17.833,01:31:19.125,This way. Come on!
01:31:35.333,01:31:36.958,"What do you want, Sarah Fier?"
01:31:38.541,01:31:41.208,You want this? You can have it!
01:31:41.291,01:31:45.000,Just let my sister live! Just let my sister live!
01:31:53.833,01:31:54.958,Get ready to run.
01:31:55.041,01:31:57.166,"-No, Cindy, no! No, Cindy! -Let's go!"
01:32:10.416,01:32:11.708,No!
01:32:11.791,01:32:13.250,No!
01:33:52.166,01:33:56.791,"Five thousand, nine hundred and thirty-seven days ago."
01:33:57.458,01:34:01.916,My sister was dead… and so was I.
01:34:07.083,01:34:08.583,"No! Hey, hey!"
01:34:08.666,01:34:10.166,"Don't die on me, OK?"
01:34:17.166,01:34:19.333,"Come on, come on, come on!"
01:34:24.208,01:34:25.958,Come on. Come on!
01:34:35.416,01:34:36.500,Breathe.
01:34:57.291,01:34:58.416,"Wait, you're Ziggy?"
01:35:07.166,01:35:08.166,Ziggy.
01:35:11.708,01:35:14.166,"Her real name, it's Christine Berman."
01:35:16.875,01:35:19.250,Where's my… Where's my sister?
01:35:30.125,01:35:35.041,my sister… She sacrificed herself for nothing.
01:35:36.833,01:35:39.458,I told everyone the story of how she died.
01:35:40.000,01:35:41.625,The story I just told you.
01:35:42.708,01:35:44.375,And no one believed me.
01:35:46.875,01:35:48.041,And Nick?
01:35:52.708,01:35:55.208,"Sarah Fier, the witch."
01:35:56.833,01:35:59.791,"The curse, it's… it's real."
01:36:04.125,01:36:05.916,I thought he would believe me.
01:36:07.208,01:36:09.333,But Nick had a destiny in this town.
01:36:10.333,01:36:13.541,And you don't become sheriff talking about ghost stories.
01:36:17.458,01:36:19.125,What the hell happened here?
01:36:25.208,01:36:26.416,He just went crazy.
01:36:41.666,01:36:43.041,Not after that.
01:36:58.125,01:37:07.791,"The town curse… For one night, Cindy believed that there was a way to end it."
01:37:10.041,01:37:11.750,So I thought there was too.
01:37:14.708,01:37:22.916,But now I know… there is no end.
01:37:33.750,01:37:36.291,"Like I said, your best chance is to run from this place."
01:37:36.375,01:37:39.333,"Go as far as you can, hope a bus doesn't hit you on the way out."
01:37:39.416,01:37:44.625,We found the body off Highway 5 in the woods between Shadyside and Sunnyvale.
01:37:45.125,01:37:46.208,It's not possible.
01:37:49.000,01:37:50.875,"The chains, the bones, the whole thing."
01:37:50.958,01:37:51.916,That could be anyone.
01:37:52.000,01:37:54.708,Why do you think our friends died?
01:37:55.750,01:37:59.041,"For the same reason they killed Alice, your sister."
01:37:59.708,01:38:03.500,The killers came after us because we found something they didn't want us to find.
01:38:03.583,01:38:08.000,"And I wish to God that it never happened, but we found it."
01:38:09.708,01:38:12.833,We found what you were looking for in '78.
01:38:14.791,01:38:16.375,We found Sarah Fier.
01:38:17.708,01:38:20.208,"Look, please, we… Nurse Lane was right."
01:38:20.791,01:38:23.541,We can end the curse by reuniting the hand with the body.
01:38:23.625,01:38:26.625,"And we know where the body is, so all we need is the hand."
01:38:26.708,01:38:30.375,What happened to Camp Nightwing? Is the hand bone still there?
01:38:30.458,01:38:33.125,Is it still buried underneath the Hanging Tree?
01:39:17.541,01:39:21.833,Says that you two used to be in a Judy Blume book club together?
01:39:22.666,01:39:24.083,"Is that a real thing, boss?"
01:39:26.458,01:39:28.416,"Hey, uh… Nicky, you there?"
01:39:30.291,01:39:31.875,"Yeah, I'll take care of it."
01:39:47.666,01:39:49.916,"-Lock the doors. -No, I'm coming with you!"
01:39:54.375,01:39:55.666,Your nose is bleeding.
01:40:01.375,01:40:02.375,I'll be right back.
01:40:02.875,01:40:04.916,Wait. Deena! Deena!
01:40:29.166,01:40:33.000,I got you… you witch.
01:40:36.333,01:40:37.416,It's over.
01:41:02.375,01:41:03.583,Sarah Fier!
01:41:26.500,01:41:28.166,And cast his Darkness over us.
01:41:32.541,01:41:34.875,This Darkness grows within each of us.
01:42:04.791,01:42:07.875,You see it now… don't you?
