00:00:28.695,00:00:32.240,"Temperature is 84 for downtown Los Angeles, overnight lows of 75."
00:01:14.741,00:04:59.882,"I left him at a Greyhound station West of Santa Fe We were 17 but he was sweet And it was true Still I did what I had to do 'Cause I just knew Summer Sunday nights We'd sink into our seats Right as they dimmed out all the lights A Technicolor world Made out of music and machine It called me to be on that screen And live inside each scene Without a nickel to my name Hopped a bus, here I came Could be brave or just insane We'll have to see 'Cause maybe in that sleepy town He'll sit one day, the lights are down He'll see my face and think Of how he used to know me Climb these hills I'm reaching for the heights And chasing all the lights that shine And when they let you down You get up off the ground 'Cause morning rolls around And it's another day of sun I hear them every day The rhythms in the canyons That'll never fade away The ballads in the bar rooms Left by those who came before They say You gotta want it more So I bang on every door And even when the answer's no Or when my money's running low The dusty mic and neon glow are all I need And someday as I sing my song A small-town kid'll come along That'll be the thing to push him on And go, go Climb these hills I'm reaching for the heights And chasing all the lights that shine And when they let you down You get up off the ground 'Cause morning rolls around And it's another day of sun And when they've let you down The morning rolls around It's another day of sun It's another day of sun It's another day of sun, Sun, sun, sun, sun, sun It's another day of sun Just another day of sun It's another day of sun Another day has just begun It's another day of sun It's another day of sun including for the 1998 film Shakespeare in Love."
00:05:28.786,00:05:32.206,"No, I swear to God, she was wrecked."
00:05:34.959,00:05:39.672,I know. I know. It was pure insanity.

00:07:13.933,00:07:16.436,"It was so crazy, and I just..."
00:07:17.019,00:07:18.062,"Oh, you would have died."

00:07:58.269,00:07:59.520,I just thought...

00:08:27.381,00:08:28.925,"Oh, you know what?"

00:09:39.453,00:09:40.705,Thank you.
00:09:44.000,00:09:47.086,"-Eh. -Eh, same here. Was Jen there or Rachel?"
00:09:47.169,00:09:48.713,I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.
00:09:48.963,00:09:51.549,"-They're the worst. -Well, I don't know if they were there."
00:09:52.258,00:09:53.134,I bet they were.
00:09:59.098,00:10:01.434,I can't! I'm working.
00:10:03.519,00:10:04.812,Did she just say working?

00:10:17.325,00:10:22.371,"It's not. It's gonna be a bunch of social climbers, all packed into one of those big glass houses."
00:10:22.455,00:10:23.497,This looks familiar.
00:10:24.165,00:10:26.542,-I was gonna give that back. -How long have you had this?
00:10:26.626,00:10:28.127,"-A long time. -Come on, Mia."
00:10:28.669,00:10:33.424,When else are you gonna get to see every Hollywood cliche crammed into the same room? We'll make fun of it together!
00:10:35.760,00:10:36.719,There's nothing to make fun of.

00:18:54.049,00:18:56.093,Can you believe that they turned it into a samba-tapas place?

00:19:13.652,00:19:14.653,Then what are we gonna talk about?
00:19:14.736,00:19:16.530,I don't know! It doesn't matter. Okay?
00:19:16.613,00:19:18.282,Because you're living like a hermit.

00:19:22.870,00:19:24.246,...with a face tattoo that you should see.
00:19:24.329,00:19:25.414,"-Okay, low blow. -With a heart of gold."
00:19:25.497,00:19:28.250,-Get serious! -Get serious? Laura...
00:19:28.333,00:19:31.879,-I had a very serious plan for my future. -I know.
00:19:31.962,00:19:34.256,It's not my fault I got shanghaied.
00:19:34.339,00:19:37.217,You didn't get shanghaied. You got ripped off!
00:19:38.927,00:19:40.929,I don't know. It's not as romantic as that.
00:19:41.930,00:19:42.973,Don't sit...
00:19:44.266,00:19:46.518,Everybody knew that guy was shady except for you.
00:19:47.895,00:19:51.356,Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word?
00:19:51.440,00:19:54.776,Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.
00:19:55.485,00:19:56.570,I'm not gonna call her.
00:19:58.071,00:19:59.865,you're acting like life's got me on the ropes.
00:20:00.490,00:20:03.035,I want to be on the ropes. Okay?
00:20:03.118,00:20:04.786,I'm letting life hit me till it gets tired.
00:20:04.870,00:20:06.705,-Oh? -Then I'm gonna hit back.
00:20:07.039,00:20:08.415,It's a classic rope-a-dope.
00:20:09.875,00:20:13.045,"Okay, Ali. I love you. Unpack the boxes."
00:20:13.378,00:20:14.546,I'm gonna change the locks.
00:20:17.132,00:20:19.635,I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes.

00:21:22.656,00:21:26.076,"Well, if by anyone, you mean anyone other than me, that would be correct."
00:21:26.159,00:21:27.911,"I care, and I don't wanna hear the free jazz."
00:21:28.078,00:21:30.038,Right. Okay.
00:21:30.372,00:21:34.418,"Although I thought in this town it worked on a sort of one for you, one for me type system."
00:21:35.752,00:21:37.045,"How about two for you, one for me?"
00:21:38.755,00:21:40.465,How about all for you and none for me?
00:21:40.674,00:21:41.967,"-That's perfect, yes. -Great."

00:25:15.889,00:25:16.890,"Yeah, I don't think you hear what I'm saying."
00:25:16.973,00:25:18.016,You're fired.
00:25:18.099,00:25:20.101,"I think that's what you're saying, but it's not what you mean."

00:30:00.006,00:30:01.800,"-Oh, I see. You're a barista. -Yeah."
00:30:01.883,00:30:05.053,And I could see how you could then look down on me from all the way up there.
00:30:05.136,00:30:06.471,Time for next set.
00:30:08.306,00:30:09.724,He doesn't... I don't...
00:30:10.558,00:30:11.810,He doesn't tell me what to do.
00:30:12.060,00:30:13.228,He just told you what to do.
00:30:13.311,00:30:14.646,I know. I let him.
00:30:15.188,00:30:16.189,What's your name?
00:30:16.272,00:30:17.315,-Mia. -Mia.
00:30:19.567,00:30:20.819,Guess I'll see you in the movies.
00:30:25.907,00:30:30.078,"I have this idea to do a re-imagine of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, but from the perspective of the bears."
00:30:30.161,00:30:31.996,-The Hero's Journey. -It could be like a franchise.
00:30:32.080,00:30:33.081,-Right. -There's a lot we don't know.
00:30:33.164,00:30:34.749,"There could have been a fourth bear, we don't know."
00:30:34.833,00:30:35.834,George Michael!
00:30:41.756,00:30:42.757,Hello.
00:30:43.007,00:30:44.008,"-Sorry. -Yeah, yeah."
00:30:44.092,00:30:46.302,I know that guy. Did you get your keys?
00:30:49.013,00:30:50.014,"Mm-hmm, yes."
00:30:50.598,00:30:51.641,Can you grab mine?
00:30:51.850,00:30:52.851,Can I what?
00:30:55.728,00:30:56.771,Can you grab my keys?
00:30:57.105,00:30:58.106,Oh.
00:31:08.616,00:31:09.951,That doesn't help me.
00:31:10.326,00:31:11.244,With a green ribbon.
00:31:11.744,00:31:12.704,All right.
00:31:15.748,00:31:18.293,"Those look, uh, comfortable."
00:31:21.546,00:31:23.089,Thank you for saving the day back there.
00:31:25.884,00:31:28.219,"Well, you didn't really give me much of a choice."
00:31:29.721,00:31:31.723,It's pretty strange that we keep running into each other.
00:31:32.849,00:31:33.850,It is strange.
00:31:35.810,00:31:36.769,Maybe it means something.
00:31:36.853,00:31:37.979,"-I doubt it. -Yeah, I don't think so."
00:31:38.062,00:31:39.063,Where's my car?
00:31:40.565,00:31:41.858,You gotta put that thing to your chin.
00:31:42.650,00:31:43.735,-This? -Yeah.
00:31:44.944,00:31:47.113,"-It makes your head into an antenna, so... -Ooh."
00:31:47.196,00:31:48.865,"I think it gives you cancer, but you find your car faster."
00:31:49.032,00:31:50.033,What?
00:31:50.116,00:31:52.869,"You don't live as long, but you get where you're going quicker, so it all evens out."
00:31:52.952,00:31:53.953,That sounds terrible.
00:31:54.579,00:31:55.830,-Just a suggestion. -You're...
00:31:57.206,00:31:59.876,"You're a real, um... What's the word I'm looking for?"
00:31:59.959,00:32:01.336,Knight in shining armour?
00:32:01.586,00:32:02.629,Weirdo.
00:32:02.712,00:32:04.213,-That was the word. -Okay.
00:32:11.554,00:32:13.056,"Not much to look at, huh?"
00:32:14.015,00:32:15.141,I've seen better.
00:32:27.737,00:33:18.079,The lights are turning on A silver shine that stretches to the sea We've stumbled on a view That's tailor-made for two What a shame those two are you and me Some other girl and guy Would love this swirling sky But there's only you and I And we've got no shot This could never be You're not the type for me Really?
00:33:18.162,00:33:30.717,And there's not a spark in sight What a A waste of a lovely night You say there's nothing here?
00:33:30.800,00:33:36.014,"Well, let's make something clear I think I'll be the one to make that call But you'll call?"
00:33:36.097,00:33:39.684,And though you looked so cute In your polyester suit It's wool.
00:33:39.767,00:34:00.163,You're right I'd never fall for you at all And maybe this appeals To someone not in heels Or to any girl who feels There's some chance for romance But I'm frankly feeling nothing Is that so?
00:34:00.246,00:34:05.043,Or it could be less than nothing Good to know So you agree?
00:34:05.126,00:36:18.259,That's right What a waste of a lovely night Ah!
00:36:19.260,00:36:22.722,"Hi, Greg. Oh, sorry I'm late."
00:36:23.389,00:36:25.683,Yeah. Be there soon. Okay. Bye.
00:36:46.871,00:36:48.289,-It was just right there. -Just right here.
00:36:54.337,00:36:55.421,Do you want a ride to your car?
00:36:57.215,00:36:58.841,"No, I'm just right up here."
00:37:02.053,00:37:02.970,Good night.
00:37:09.769,00:37:10.603,Good night.
00:38:23.592,00:38:25.761,"Excuse me. This is gluten-free, right?"
00:38:27.054,00:38:28.139,No.
00:38:28.222,00:38:29.890,-What? -Mm-mm.
00:38:30.474,00:38:31.809,Ugh! I'd like a refund.
00:38:34.020,00:38:36.480,Okay. Let me check on that for you.
00:38:38.190,00:38:39.191,Mia...
00:38:39.275,00:38:40.985,-Hi. -You're closing Friday.
00:38:41.861,00:38:44.530,I can't close on Friday. I have an audition. Remember?
00:38:44.613,00:38:46.490,Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.
00:38:47.033,00:38:49.952,"Oh, and we need to have a little talk tomorrow, okay?"
00:38:50.202,00:38:51.662,"Fix your apron, please."
00:38:51.787,00:38:52.788,Okay.
00:38:57.960,00:38:58.878,You again!
00:39:01.547,00:39:02.548,What are you doing here?
00:39:02.631,00:39:05.718,"Oh, you know, just meetings and studio heads and..."
00:39:06.010,00:39:07.011,How'd you get on the lot?
00:39:08.137,00:39:10.848,"I basically just hauled ass past the guard gates, so..."
00:39:10.931,00:39:12.516,I think I have 20 minutes until they find me.
00:39:13.768,00:39:15.311,"You don't have a break coming up, do you?"
00:39:15.394,00:39:16.437,I'm off in 10 minutes.
00:39:18.856,00:39:20.149,Can I hide in the bathroom?
00:39:20.232,00:39:21.275,-Yes. -Okay.
00:39:23.569,00:39:24.570,Sorry.
00:39:24.945,00:39:26.030,Um...
00:39:26.113,00:39:27.948,I actually do have to check. I'm sorry.
00:39:32.161,00:39:35.748,That's the window that Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman looked out of in Casablanca.
00:39:37.124,00:39:39.085,I can't believe you work right across the street from that.
00:39:39.168,00:39:40.753,-Yeah. -That's amazing.
00:39:41.128,00:39:43.839,What was your Bogart's name?
00:39:44.965,00:39:46.842,What's his name? Is it Greg?
00:39:47.176,00:39:48.803,Yeah. Greg.
00:39:49.303,00:39:51.972,Right. How long have you been...
00:39:52.056,00:39:53.849,We've been seeing each other for about a month.
00:39:53.933,00:39:54.975,"Oh, that's great."
00:39:55.559,00:39:57.019,"He's, um... He's sweet."
00:39:57.103,00:39:59.063,"Anyway, I love being around this stuff, you know?"
00:39:59.271,00:40:00.106,I know what you mean.
00:40:00.189,00:40:03.567,I get coffee five miles out of the way just so I can be near a jazz club.
00:40:03.651,00:40:05.111,"-Really? -Yeah, the Van Beek."
00:40:05.194,00:40:06.404,-Do you know it? -Mm-mm.
00:40:06.487,00:40:08.072,All the big swing bands used to play there.
00:40:08.155,00:40:09.490,"Count Basie, Chick Webb."
00:40:10.908,00:40:13.119,"Anyway, it's a samba-tapas place now, so..."
00:40:14.829,00:40:16.038,What's a samba-tapas place?
00:40:16.122,00:40:18.457,It's just a samba place where they serve tapas.
00:40:18.541,00:40:20.501,"-Oh. -Yeah, so the joke's on..."
00:40:22.253,00:40:23.421,I don't know. That's LA.
00:40:23.504,00:40:26.799,They just worship everything and they value nothing.
00:40:30.970,00:40:32.304,-You're rolling? -Yeah.
00:40:32.388,00:40:34.932,"Yeah, I know. They shoot movies on my street all the time, so I know about movies."
00:40:45.693,00:40:47.111,"You know, movies, acting..."
00:40:49.655,00:40:50.781,My aunt was an actress.
00:40:50.865,00:40:51.824,"Oh, okay."
00:40:52.450,00:40:54.535,She was in a travelling theatre company.
00:40:54.743,00:40:56.495,"I grew up in Boulder City, Nevada."
00:40:57.079,00:41:01.292,So across the street from my house there was this little library that had an old movie section.
00:41:01.375,00:41:09.675,So she took me and we spent an entire day watching all these old movies like Notorious and Bringing Up Baby and Casablanca.
00:41:13.721,00:41:15.514,-She sounds incredible. -She was incredible.
00:41:15.598,00:41:23.564,"And I would put on all these plays in my bedroom, and it would basically just be she and I re-enacting those scenes from the movies."
00:41:23.647,00:41:24.982,And then I would write my own plays.
00:41:25.065,00:41:26.525,-Wow. -Um... Yeah.
00:41:47.880,00:41:48.881,I love it.
00:41:53.594,00:42:01.727,"So anyway, I left college after two years to come here and my last audition was for a teen show pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C."
00:42:01.894,00:42:05.147,"So, yeah, should've been a lawyer."
00:42:10.444,00:42:11.654,You're not just an actress.
00:42:11.737,00:42:13.197,What do you mean just an actress?
00:42:16.784,00:42:18.369,That is not what I said.
00:42:18.452,00:42:20.704,"Well, you're too modest to say it, but it's true."
00:42:21.956,00:42:23.666,"You could just write your own roles, you know?"
00:42:23.749,00:42:27.169,"Write something that's as interesting as you are, and you don't have to audition for this..."
00:42:27.253,00:42:28.754,"-Uh, pissy ca-ca. -Yeah."
00:42:28.921,00:42:30.172,Look at Louis Armstrong.
00:42:30.256,00:42:32.925,He could've just played the marching band charts that he was given.
00:42:33.008,00:42:34.343,But he didn't do that. What did he do?
00:42:34.969,00:42:37.429,"-What did he do? -Well, he made history, didn't he?"
00:42:38.264,00:42:41.016,"Well, I'm gonna stop auditioning and I'm gonna make history instead."
00:42:42.101,00:42:44.228,"Well, my work is done here."
00:42:45.980,00:42:49.233,"I should probably tell you something now, just to get it out of the way."
00:42:49.316,00:42:50.776,-Mm-hmm? -I hate jazz.
00:42:53.320,00:42:54.363,Are you okay?
00:42:54.446,00:42:55.823,"What do you mean, you hate jazz?"
00:42:56.949,00:42:58.576,"It just means that when I listen to it, I don't like it."
00:42:58.659,00:43:00.578,"Yeah, but it's such a blanket statement, you don't like jazz."
00:43:01.745,00:43:02.788,What are you doing right now?
00:43:04.415,00:43:05.416,Nothing.
00:43:22.725,00:43:27.813,"I just think that people, when they say that they, you know, hate jazz..."
00:43:29.231,00:43:33.027,"They just... They don't have context, they don't know where it comes from."
00:43:33.777,00:43:42.244,"Jazz was born in a little... flophouse in New Orleans, and it's just because people were crammed in there, they spoke five different languages, they couldn't talk to each other."
00:43:42.328,00:43:45.831,The only way they could communicate was with jazz.
00:43:46.123,00:43:47.666,"You know, what about Kenny G?"
00:43:49.084,00:43:50.836,-What? -What about Kenny G?
00:43:50.919,00:43:52.796,"I mean, what about elevator music?"
00:43:52.880,00:43:55.466,"You know, jazz music that I know?"
00:43:55.549,00:43:57.301,-What about it? -From my life?
00:43:57.384,00:43:59.720,-Mm-hmm? -I just find it relaxing.
00:43:59.803,00:44:02.139,It's not relaxing. It's not. It's not.
00:44:02.222,00:44:05.392,Sidney Bechet shot somebody because they told him he played a wrong note.
00:44:05.476,00:44:06.685,That's hardly relaxing.
00:44:06.769,00:44:10.397,"Yeah, but where I grew up there was this station called KJAZZ 103."
00:44:10.814,00:44:14.151,And people would just put on that station when they had a cocktail party...
00:44:14.234,00:44:15.152,Right.
00:44:15.235,00:44:17.488,And everyone would kind of just talk over it.
00:44:17.571,00:44:18.989,-I know. -'Cause it was...
00:44:19.073,00:44:19.948,That's the prob...
00:44:20.032,00:44:23.327,"Okay, okay. So I think that's part of the problem, is that you can't hear it, you know?"
00:44:23.410,00:44:25.496,You have to see it. You have to see what's at stake.
00:44:25.579,00:44:26.705,"I mean, look at these fellas."
00:44:26.789,00:44:28.999,Look at the sax player right now.
00:44:29.083,00:44:31.251,He just hijacked the song. He's on his own trip.
00:44:31.335,00:44:36.382,"Every one of these guys is composing, they're rearranging, they're writing, and they're playing the melody. They're just..."
00:44:36.465,00:44:37.925,"And now look, the trumpet player."
00:44:38.008,00:44:39.259,He's got his own idea.
00:44:39.343,00:44:43.389,"And so, it's conflict, and it's compromise, and it's just..."
00:44:44.056,00:44:47.142,It's new every time. It's brand-new every night.
00:44:47.226,00:44:48.936,"It's very, very exciting."
00:44:56.485,00:44:59.363,"And it's dying. It's dying, Mia."
00:44:59.571,00:45:00.989,It's dying on the vine.
00:45:01.115,00:45:04.410,"And the world says, Let it die. It had its time."
00:45:04.660,00:45:05.994,"Well, not on my watch."
00:45:07.704,00:45:08.789,What are you gonna do?
00:45:09.206,00:45:10.374,I'm gonna have my own club.
00:45:11.458,00:45:12.668,-Really? -Yes.
00:45:12.751,00:45:19.758,"We're gonna play whatever we want, whenever we want, however we want, as long as it's pure jazz."
00:45:21.343,00:45:22.761,"Hi, this is Mia Dolan."
00:45:23.262,00:45:24.680,"Yeah, I just missed a call."
00:45:32.229,00:45:33.230,I got a callback!
00:45:33.313,00:45:34.982,What? Come on!
00:45:36.483,00:45:39.862,For a TV show. The one I was telling you about earlier.
00:45:39.987,00:45:42.030,-The Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.? -Yeah.
00:45:42.114,00:45:43.073,Congratulations!
00:45:43.157,00:45:44.199,-That's incredible! -It's really exciting.
00:45:44.283,00:45:46.160,I feel like I said negative stuff about it before.
00:45:46.243,00:45:48.287,"-What? -It's like Rebel Without A Cause, sort of."
00:45:49.288,00:45:50.956,I got the bullets!
00:45:51.790,00:45:52.791,Yes.
00:45:54.251,00:45:56.003,-You've never seen it! -I've never seen it.
00:45:56.086,00:45:58.755,"Oh, my! You know, it's playing at the Rialto."
00:45:58.839,00:45:59.840,-Really? -Yes.

00:47:06.073,00:47:17.334,City of Stars There's so much that I can't see Who knows?
00:47:18.710,00:47:24.132,Is this the start Of something wonderful and new?
00:47:25.551,00:47:33.267,Or one more dream That I cannot make true?
00:48:01.211,00:48:03.005,"-Stand right there, please. -Okay. Nice to meet you."
00:48:31.742,00:48:32.743,In your own time.
00:48:32.993,00:48:33.994,Okay.
00:48:38.081,00:48:39.041,Two options.
00:48:39.625,00:48:41.960,You either follow my rules or follow my rules.
00:48:42.044,00:48:43.253,-Capisce? -Thank you.
00:48:46.089,00:48:46.965,I can do it a different way.

00:49:34.805,00:49:36.807,"Hey, babe. Got a space out front."
00:49:39.476,00:49:40.936,My brother landed really early.
00:49:44.398,00:49:45.649,-Did you forget? -Shit.
00:49:45.732,00:49:46.733,You forgot.
00:49:46.817,00:49:48.110,That's tonight.
00:49:48.568,00:49:50.487,-That's okay. You forgot. -Yeah. Okay.
00:49:50.570,00:49:52.447,"All right, so then I'll just get changed."
00:49:52.531,00:49:54.032,-Okay. Great. -Okay. Great.
00:49:57.577,00:49:58.704,"-Yeah, that's him. -Um..."
00:49:58.787,00:50:00.580,"Hey, Josh, yeah. Uh..."
00:50:00.664,00:50:02.708,"Just picking up Mia. We'll be there in, like..."
00:50:09.589,00:50:11.007,"But better than being in a theatre, really."
00:50:23.603,00:50:24.563,"Oh, it's the worst!"
00:50:28.191,00:50:29.192,Hello?
00:50:29.276,00:50:30.819,-Probably work. -Mm.
00:50:37.367,00:50:39.703,"-Sorry. So, yeah, we love it. -Oh, it's so nice."
00:51:07.314,00:51:08.899,but honestly it was life-changing.
00:51:10.233,00:51:11.193,It affected me.
00:51:11.276,00:51:13.361,-It was incredible. -Is it amazing?
00:51:13.904,00:51:17.908,-Yes. -A five-star jungle eco-resort -you would not believe. -Amazing.
00:51:20.535,00:51:22.329,is it's less developed. It's a little under-developed.
00:51:24.831,00:51:27.083,"Yeah, then, I just... I don't know. I don't know if it's safe."
00:52:00.450,00:52:01.785,I'm sorry.
00:53:38.757,00:53:47.974,For many days before the end of our Earth people will look into the night sky and notice a star increasingly bright and increasingly near.
00:53:48.350,00:53:49.976,As this star approaches us...
00:53:54.522,00:53:56.149,I'll go find a place. I'm sorry.
00:53:57.859,00:53:58.985,the weather will change.
00:53:59.819,00:54:05.784,"The great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide, and the seas will turn warm."
00:54:07.327,00:54:13.541,"The last of us search the heavens and stand amazed, for the stars will still be there and will be..."
00:54:26.304,00:54:27.472,Mm...
00:54:30.892,00:54:31.851,I have an idea.
00:59:07.585,00:59:09.504,What is that? Is it a script?
00:59:09.587,00:59:10.588,It's a play.
00:59:13.883,00:59:15.593,"Actually, it's a one-woman show!"
00:59:16.344,00:59:17.178,So I can't.
00:59:22.642,00:59:24.811,Wow. Is that gonna happen every time?
00:59:25.603,00:59:26.813,I think so.
01:02:26.701,01:02:27.702,Keith.
01:02:27.952,01:02:29.036,"Come here, man."
01:02:31.122,01:02:32.707,"-How are you? -I've been good, man."
01:02:32.790,01:02:34.834,"This is Mia. Mia, Keith."
01:02:34.917,01:02:35.960,"Hi, Mia. Nice to meet you."
01:02:36.043,01:02:37.962,-Nice to meet you. -I used to play with this guy.
01:02:38.671,01:02:39.797,Went to school together.
01:02:40.298,01:02:41.883,"-So how you been, brother? -Great."
01:02:42.091,01:02:43.426,Never been better. How about you?
01:02:43.509,01:02:45.261,I've been really good. Been very busy.
01:02:45.344,01:02:46.429,I got a new combo.
01:02:46.512,01:02:47.930,Okay. Cool.
01:02:48.014,01:02:49.182,We're looking for keys.
01:02:50.933,01:02:52.727,"-Are you kidding me? -No, I'm not kidding you."
01:02:53.436,01:02:55.354,"-No, I'm good. -Are you sure? It pays."
01:02:56.689,01:02:57.940,I'm good.
01:02:58.024,01:03:00.401,Let's just grab a drink then. It's been too long.
01:03:00.526,01:03:01.944,"-Okay. -Nice to meet you, Mia."
01:03:13.080,01:03:14.248,The End.
01:03:21.255,01:03:22.173,-Really? -Yes.
01:03:22.256,01:03:23.132,-Really? -Yes.
01:03:23.216,01:03:24.801,It feels really nostalgic to me.
01:03:24.884,01:03:25.927,-Is it too nostalgic? -That's the point.
01:03:26.010,01:03:27.053,Are people gonna like it?
01:03:30.264,01:03:31.224,You always say that.
01:03:31.307,01:03:33.142,"Well, I truly believe it."
01:03:33.851,01:03:35.019,I made you something.
01:03:35.102,01:03:35.937,For what?
01:03:36.312,01:03:37.522,For your club.
01:03:40.191,01:03:41.192,Why does it say Seb's?
01:03:41.275,01:03:42.485,'Cause I think you should call it Seb's.
01:03:42.610,01:03:45.321,-What? -'Cause no one's gonna come -to Chicken On A Stick.
01:03:45.404,01:03:47.156,Is that a music note as an apostrophe?
01:03:47.240,01:03:48.449,-Yes! Yeah. -That's pretty cool.
01:03:48.616,01:03:49.784,It's gotta be Chicken On A Stick.
01:03:50.618,01:03:52.662,Because Charlie Parker got his nickname...
01:03:52.745,01:03:54.080,"I know, because he loved chicken."
01:03:56.207,01:03:57.750,That's why they called him Bird.
01:03:58.459,01:04:01.212,"So I'm gonna have chicken, beer, jazz... Chicken On A Stick."
01:04:01.295,01:04:04.549,"I know. You should drop the chicken and just have drinks and jazz, and also..."
01:04:04.632,01:04:05.633,I'm not dropping the chicken.
01:04:05.716,01:04:07.635,You could maybe do it somewhere else.
01:04:07.802,01:04:09.262,-What are you talk... -Find a new spot.
01:04:09.345,01:04:10.596,It's gotta be the Van Beek.
01:04:10.680,01:04:12.181,"Well, it doesn't have to be the Van Beek."
01:04:12.265,01:04:14.183,I can't let them samba all over its history.
01:04:16.644,01:04:18.980,"You can let them, but you refuse to."
01:04:19.063,01:04:20.481,Your play's incredible.
01:04:21.607,01:04:24.694,"You know, the whole world from your bedroom."
01:04:25.945,01:04:29.115,What else do they want? Who's doing that?
01:04:30.116,01:04:31.701,-I'm doing that. -You're doing that.
01:04:33.244,01:04:34.745,Who was that guy at The Lighthouse?
01:04:36.247,01:04:37.373,The guy that offered you the gig?
01:04:37.456,01:04:38.583,-Keith. -Yeah.
01:04:38.749,01:04:40.042,Why was it so weird between you two?
01:04:40.293,01:04:42.628,It's always weird with him.
01:04:43.004,01:04:44.130,-Really? -Yeah.
01:04:44.338,01:04:47.341,But he seemed kind of nice 'cause he did offer you a job.
01:04:48.676,01:04:49.719,Are you gonna call him?
01:04:49.802,01:04:52.513,No. No.
01:04:52.930,01:04:53.764,All right.
01:04:54.932,01:04:58.019,So... Here's what we know.
01:04:58.144,01:04:59.228,Yeah?
01:05:00.062,01:05:05.192,"It's definitely Chicken On A Stick, and your play is gonna be a triumph."
01:05:10.865,01:05:13.326,"No, I mean, I'm acting in it, too."
01:05:15.036,01:05:18.831,"No, Mom. I'm not getting paid. I'm paying to do it."
01:05:21.042,01:05:23.461,He's great. He's gonna open his own jazz club.
01:05:23.711,01:05:25.087,"Yeah, it's gonna be incredible."
01:05:28.090,01:05:30.760,"No, he hasn't, he hasn't opened it yet. He needs some..."
01:05:35.139,01:05:36.432,"He's saving up, I think."
01:05:42.980,01:05:44.774,"No, he doesn't have a steady gig."
01:05:45.024,01:05:47.860,But he's figuring it out. It's just been a little tricky lately.
01:05:52.031,01:05:54.992,"Mom, he's gonna find a way to open it, and you're gonna love it, okay?"
01:05:55.242,01:05:56.285,How's Dad?
01:06:04.293,01:06:05.294,Sebastian.
01:06:06.128,01:06:07.672,"Come on in, man."
01:06:09.131,01:06:10.883,-Thanks for coming. -Thanks for having me.
01:06:10.967,01:06:12.259,Wasn't sure I'd see you today.
01:06:13.469,01:06:15.388,"-So, here's the deal. -Okay."
01:06:15.471,01:06:16.973,We got distribution with Universal.
01:06:17.056,01:06:18.057,We've got our own imprint.
01:06:18.557,01:06:19.600,About to go on the road.
01:06:20.059,01:06:24.855,"Uh, we can pay you 1,000 bucks a week, plus a cut of the ticket revenue and merchandising."
01:06:25.272,01:06:26.273,Sound good?
01:06:29.443,01:06:31.112,-Sebastian? All right. -Yeah.
01:06:31.779,01:06:32.863,-Let's play. -Okay.
01:07:30.129,01:07:32.631,I know. It's different.
01:07:35.217,01:07:36.844,But you say you wanna save jazz.
01:07:37.595,01:07:39.597,How you gonna save jazz if no one's listening?
01:07:40.181,01:07:42.558,Jazz is dying because of people like you.
01:07:42.641,01:07:46.103,You're playing to 90-year-olds at The Lighthouse.
01:07:46.979,01:07:48.689,Where are the kids? Where are the young people?
01:07:50.024,01:07:53.611,You're so obsessed with Kenny Clarke and Thelonious Monk.
01:07:53.861,01:07:55.196,These guys were revolutionaries.
01:07:55.946,01:07:59.408,How are you gonna be a revolutionary if you're such a traditionalist?
01:07:59.867,01:08:03.496,"You're holding onto the past, but jazz is about the future."
01:08:08.667,01:08:09.668,I know.
01:08:10.628,01:08:13.214,"The other guy, he wasn't as good as you."
01:08:14.965,01:08:17.093,"But you're a pain in the ass, man."
01:08:57.466,01:09:03.806,City of Stars Are you shining just for me?
01:09:06.976,01:09:17.987,City of Stars There's so much that I can't see Who knows?
01:09:19.488,01:12:37.770,"I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you That now our dreams May finally come true City of Stars Just one thing everybody wants There in the bars Or through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants It's love Yes, all we're looking for is love From someone else A rush A glance A touch A dance A look in somebody's eyes To light up the skies To open the world and send it reeling A voice that says I'll be here And you'll be all right I don't care if I know Just where I will go 'Cause all that I need's This crazy feeling A rat-tat-tat on my heart Think I want it to stay Are you shining just for me?"
01:12:41.315,01:14:24.293,"City of Stars You never shined so brightly I don't know Why I keep moving my body I don't know if this is wrong Or if it's right I don't know if it's the beat But something's taken over me And I just know I feel so good tonight I don't know what your name is But I like it I've been thinking About some things I wanna try I don't know what you came to do But I wanna do it with you And I just know I feel so good tonight Oh, if we keep on dancing Take our rhythm to new heights Feel the heat of passion, baby Light up the night!"
01:14:24.376,01:14:26.128,We can start a fire!
01:14:26.670,01:14:30.924,"Come on, let it burn, baby We can start a fire!"
01:14:31.216,01:14:38.765,"Let the tables turn, baby We can start a fire!"
01:14:39.600,01:14:46.857,I just know I feel so good Don't you know I feel so good I just know I feel so good...
01:14:48.734,01:15:36.990,Tonight I don't care if this turns into a riot Let's get reckless Tear this place down to the floor Turn the music way up loud Can't nobody stop us now I just know I feel so good tonight I just know I feel so good tonight We can start a fire!
01:15:37.407,01:15:39.701,"Come on, let it burn, baby!"
01:15:39.785,01:15:41.411,We can start a fire!
01:15:42.204,01:15:44.373,"Let the tables turn, baby!"
01:15:44.456,01:15:49.336,We can start a fire!
01:15:49.419,01:16:00.806,"Oh, I just know I feel so good Don't you know I feel so good Don't you know Don't you know Tonight!"
01:16:37.843,01:16:39.052,"Hey, it's me."
01:16:39.595,01:16:42.264,"Uh, I'm not sure where you are right now. I think Boston."
01:16:43.140,01:16:44.683,"Maybe Dallas, I don't know."
01:16:45.642,01:16:46.602,Uh...
01:16:47.311,01:16:52.733,"I haven't heard from you in a little while, and I miss you."
01:16:55.110,01:16:56.278,"All right, bye."
01:17:32.981,01:17:34.024,I thought...
01:17:35.442,01:17:36.485,Surprise.
01:17:39.404,01:17:42.366,"Gotta leave first thing in the morning, but I just had to see you."
01:17:52.417,01:17:53.877,I'm so glad you're home.
01:17:56.546,01:17:57.631,How's the play going?
01:17:58.298,01:18:00.050,Um... I'm nervous.
01:18:00.509,01:18:01.927,-You are? Why? -Mm-hmm.
01:18:02.386,01:18:04.304,Because what if people show up?
01:18:04.388,01:18:05.555,Pissy ca-ca.
01:18:06.348,01:18:07.766,You're nervous about what they think?
01:18:09.101,01:18:11.269,I'm nervous to do it. I'm nervous to get up...
01:18:12.020,01:18:14.690,"on a stage and perform for people... I mean, I don't need to say that to you."
01:18:14.773,01:18:18.276,"-It's gonna be incredible. -You don't get it, but I'm terrified."
01:18:18.443,01:18:20.237,They should be so lucky to see it.
01:18:20.904,01:18:21.947,I can't wait.
01:18:22.614,01:18:23.657,I can.
01:18:26.243,01:18:27.369,"When do you leave, the morning?"
01:18:28.578,01:18:30.372,Yeah. 6:45.
01:18:30.706,01:18:31.832,-Ooh. -Boise.
01:18:32.874,01:18:34.459,-Boy-he? -Boyden.
01:18:35.252,01:18:36.294,To Boise!
01:18:39.589,01:18:40.590,You should come.
01:18:42.426,01:18:43.468,To Boise?
01:18:43.552,01:18:45.178,"Yeah, you can knock that off your bucket list."
01:18:45.262,01:18:49.099,"Oh, that would be... really exciting. I wish I could."
01:18:49.391,01:18:50.600,What are you doing after the tour?
01:18:52.185,01:18:53.270,Why can't you?
01:18:53.645,01:18:54.688,-Come to Boise? -Yeah.
01:18:54.771,01:18:55.814,'Cause I have to rehearse.
01:18:56.523,01:18:58.024,But can't you rehearse anywhere?
01:19:02.112,01:19:03.238,Anywhere you are?
01:19:04.448,01:19:06.116,"I mean, I guess."
01:19:07.284,01:19:08.118,Um...
01:19:08.618,01:19:12.330,"Well, all my stuff is here, and it's in two weeks, so I don't really think that would be..."
01:19:13.749,01:19:14.708,Okay.
01:19:14.791,01:19:19.171,"The best idea right now, but I wish I could."
01:19:20.422,01:19:22.048,We're just gonna have to try and see each other.
01:19:22.132,01:19:23.550,We almost never see each other.
01:19:23.633,01:19:24.885,"I know, but when are you done?"
01:19:26.344,01:19:27.596,What do you mean? I mean...
01:19:29.139,01:19:30.432,When are you finished with the whole tour?
01:19:31.141,01:19:34.436,"But after we finish, we're gonna go and record, and then we go back on tour."
01:19:35.312,01:19:38.690,We tour so we can make the record so we can go back and tour the record.
01:19:43.028,01:19:44.488,So it's like the long haul?
01:19:48.408,01:19:49.618,"What do you mean, the long haul?"
01:19:50.285,01:19:51.369,I mean the long haul.
01:19:51.453,01:19:54.539,Like you're gonna stay in this band for a long time.
01:19:55.957,01:19:56.958,On tour.
01:19:59.252,01:20:00.796,"I mean, what did you think I was gonna do?"
01:20:00.879,01:20:03.548,I don't... I hadn't really thought it through.
01:20:03.632,01:20:04.925,I didn't know that the band...
01:20:06.927,01:20:08.428,-was so important. -You didn't think it would be successful?
01:20:10.013,01:20:11.139,Um...
01:20:12.724,01:20:15.435,"No, that's not really what I mean. I just mean that you..."
01:20:15.936,01:20:18.814,"You're gonna be on tour for, what, months now? Years?"
01:20:19.314,01:20:20.816,Yeah. I don't believe... This is it.
01:20:20.899,01:20:23.193,"I mean, it could feasibly be..."
01:20:23.276,01:20:26.112,"I could be on tour with this for a couple of years, at least."
01:20:26.196,01:20:27.280,Just this record.
01:20:28.615,01:20:30.325,Do you like the music you're playing?
01:20:34.996,01:20:37.916,I don't know what it matters.
01:20:38.792,01:20:46.633,"Well, it matters, because if you're gonna give up your dream, I think it matters that you like what you're playing on the road for years."
01:20:49.427,01:20:50.846,Do you like the music I'm playing?
01:20:51.137,01:20:51.972,Yeah.
01:20:54.057,01:20:54.891,I do.
01:20:55.141,01:20:56.768,I just didn't think that you did.
01:20:57.143,01:21:04.484,"-Yeah, well... -You always said Keith is the worst, and now you're gonna be on tour with him for years, -so I just didn't know if you were happy. -What are you doing right now?"
01:21:04.568,01:21:05.610,-Why are you doing this? -I don't...
01:21:05.694,01:21:07.821,"-What do you mean, why am I doing this? -I thought you wanted me to do this."
01:21:07.904,01:21:09.656,It just sounds like now you don't want me to do it.
01:21:09.739,01:21:11.783,"What do you mean, I wanted you to do this?"
01:21:12.409,01:21:13.827,This is what you wanted for me.
01:21:14.536,01:21:15.537,To be in this band?
01:21:15.871,01:21:18.290,"To be in a band. To have a steady job, you know?"
01:21:18.623,01:21:21.001,"To be, you know..."
01:21:22.210,01:21:27.257,"Of course, I wanted you to have a steady job, so that you could take care of yourself and your life, and you could start your club."
01:21:27.340,01:21:28.800,So I'm doing that. So I don't understand.
01:21:28.884,01:21:29.801,Why aren't we celebrating?
01:21:29.885,01:21:31.303,Why aren't you starting your club?
01:21:31.887,01:21:34.097,You said yourself no one wants to go to that club.
01:21:34.389,01:21:36.433,No one wants to go to a club called Chicken On A Stick.
01:21:36.516,01:21:37.601,So change the name!
01:21:37.851,01:21:39.936,"Well, no one likes jazz! Not even you!"
01:21:40.020,01:21:41.771,I do like jazz now because of you!
01:21:41.855,01:21:43.607,And this is what I thought you wanted me to do!
01:21:44.399,01:21:47.527,What am I supposed to do? Go back to playing Jingle Bells?
01:21:47.611,01:21:52.490,I'm not saying that. I'm saying -why don't you take what you've made... -Scraping pennies so I can start a club -no one wants to go to? -...and start the club?
01:21:52.574,01:21:57.871,"People will want to go to it because you're passionate about it, and people love what other people are passionate about."
01:21:57.954,01:22:00.290,-You remind people of what they forgot. -Not in my experience.
01:22:04.169,01:22:07.714,"Well, whatever, all right? It's just time to grow up, you know?"
01:22:07.797,01:22:09.883,"I have a steady job, this is what I'm doing."
01:22:09.966,01:22:15.096,"And now all of a sudden if you had these problems, I wish you would have said them earlier, before I signed on the goddamn dotted line!"
01:22:15.180,01:22:20.810,"I'm pointing out that you had a dream that you followed, that you were sticking to-- This is the dream! This is the dream."
01:22:20.894,01:22:22.270,This is not your dream!
01:22:22.354,01:22:26.524,"Guys like me work their whole lives to be in something that's successful, that people like."
01:22:26.608,01:22:27.609,You know?
01:22:31.529,01:22:32.864,Since when do you care about being liked?
01:22:32.948,01:22:34.449,"Just 'cause I don't enjoy, it doesn't matter."
01:22:34.658,01:22:36.451,Why do you care so much about being liked?
01:22:36.534,01:22:38.620,You're an actress! What are you talking about?
01:22:56.846,01:23:00.392,Maybe you just liked me when I was on my ass 'cause it made you feel better about yourself.
01:23:05.438,01:23:07.273,-Are you kidding? -No.
01:23:28.878,01:23:29.879,I don't know.
01:24:50.335,01:24:52.504,"Okay, fellas. I'll see you tomorrow."
01:24:52.670,01:24:53.838,-Sebastian? -Yeah?
01:24:53.922,01:24:55.006,"You're good for tonight, right?"
01:24:58.384,01:24:59.761,"7:00, the photo shoot."
01:25:01.137,01:25:02.806,Mojo. Are you good?
01:25:05.975,01:25:07.435,I thought that was next Thursday.
01:25:08.019,01:25:09.020,"No, it's tonight."
01:25:12.107,01:25:13.108,Is that okay?
01:26:09.581,01:26:11.666,-Give me the other camera! -What's wrong with that one?
01:26:11.749,01:26:14.669,"What's wrong with it? It doesn't bloody work, that's what's wrong with it!"
01:26:15.211,01:26:16.796,"All right, trumpet, that's lovely."
01:26:18.464,01:26:20.800,"Lovely! Beautiful, beautiful!"
01:26:21.593,01:26:23.887,"Okay, keyboard. Okay, look up."
01:26:24.137,01:26:27.015,"That's good. That's good, that's lovely. Lovely."
01:26:27.098,01:26:28.433,"Okay, cut the music!"
01:26:28.516,01:26:30.977,That is lovely. That's lovely.
01:26:31.060,01:26:34.564,"Okay, now bite your lip like this, sort of like..."
01:26:34.981,01:26:38.651,"Like you're concentrating on something, I don't know, like a piece of your music."
01:26:39.277,01:26:41.529,"-Bite my what? -Your lip. You know, bite your lip..."
01:26:43.198,01:26:44.157,Okay.
01:26:44.240,01:26:45.783,"Yeah, that's good. That's great."
01:26:45.867,01:26:47.118,Beautiful! Beautiful.
01:26:47.202,01:26:50.997,"Okay, now just move your glasses down on onto the nose."
01:26:51.080,01:26:53.249,"A little bit further, just a little bit, a touch further."
01:26:53.333,01:26:55.627,"Keep your head down, but look up at me."
01:26:55.710,01:26:57.045,Look sort of moody.
01:26:57.420,01:27:00.006,Yeah! That's beautiful! That is great!
01:27:00.131,01:27:02.008,"Okay, turn the keyboard on live!"
01:27:04.510,01:27:06.054,You don't have to bite your lip now.
01:27:07.430,01:27:08.640,"Well, actually play something."
01:27:10.058,01:27:11.643,Play something. You know? Anything.
01:27:12.018,01:27:13.519,"You're a pianist, aren't you? Play something."
01:27:27.200,01:27:28.868,"That's great, that's beautiful."
01:27:28.952,01:27:30.745,"That's lovely. Oh, that's good."
01:27:30.828,01:27:32.247,"No, don't stop. Keep playing."
01:27:32.956,01:27:35.291,"Go on, just keep playing. That was great!"
01:28:24.924,01:28:26.884,"Oh, my God! Don't quit your day job."
01:28:27.552,01:28:28.636,"Oh, well..."
01:28:29.429,01:28:32.223,Not good. One-woman shows are always terrible.
01:28:55.705,01:28:56.622,Mia!
01:28:58.916,01:29:01.294,Mia. I'm so sorry.
01:29:03.921,01:29:06.466,Just tell me how it went. How was it?
01:29:06.549,01:29:08.217,-Don't help me. -I'm sorry.
01:29:09.093,01:29:10.386,I'm sorry I've been such a prick.
01:29:10.470,01:29:13.139,"You're sorry, you're sorry..."
01:29:14.390,01:29:15.558,I'm gonna make it up to you.
01:29:16.642,01:29:18.186,"Let me make it up to you, okay?"
01:29:24.609,01:29:26.444,-I don't blame you for not wanting... -It's over.
01:29:29.989,01:29:30.823,What?
01:29:33.034,01:29:34.077,All of this.
01:29:34.660,01:29:38.289,I'm done embarrassing myself. I'm done. I'm done.
01:29:39.248,01:29:40.666,-Nobody showed up. -So what? So what?
01:29:40.750,01:29:43.211,I can't pay back the theater. This is so...
01:29:44.921,01:29:46.464,I'm gonna go home for a while.
01:29:46.672,01:29:49.675,"-I'll come see you tomorrow. -No, I'm going home home."
01:29:50.676,01:29:51.511,This is home.
01:29:51.594,01:29:52.970,"No, it's not any more."
01:32:08.940,01:32:09.774,Yep?
01:32:13.110,01:32:14.111,Wrong number.
01:32:14.195,01:32:16.489,She's not answering her cell. I was told I might find her here.
01:32:16.572,01:32:17.573,Not any more.
01:32:18.282,01:32:20.201,"-Okay, well, if you do talk to her... -I won't."
01:32:20.284,01:32:23.037,...could you tell her Jane at Amy Brandt Casting is trying to reach her?
01:32:29.543,01:32:30.544,Casting?
01:32:39.178,01:32:40.346,Who the hell is that?
01:32:59.532,01:33:00.741,Because I have good news.
01:33:01.617,01:33:02.451,What?
01:33:02.868,01:33:04.870,"Amy Brandt, the casting director..."
01:33:05.705,01:33:08.916,"-Yeah. -She was at your play, and she loved it."
01:33:09.750,01:33:10.918,And she loved it so much...
01:33:11.877,01:33:15.965,that she wants you to come in tomorrow and audition for this huge movie that she's got.
01:33:18.009,01:33:19.051,I'm not going to that.
01:33:21.679,01:33:22.805,-I'm not going to that. -What?
01:33:22.888,01:33:25.516,That one's gonna be... No. That one's gonna be...
01:33:25.766,01:33:26.600,I'm sorry?
01:33:27.018,01:33:28.311,That will kill me.
01:33:31.939,01:33:33.441,What? Shh! Stop!
01:33:35.067,01:33:36.694,You have to be quiet. We're in a neighbourhood.
01:33:36.777,01:33:39.697,"If you want me to be quiet, you have to make some goddamn sense!"
01:33:39.780,01:33:41.032,-Tell me why you're not going. -They'll call the police.
01:33:41.115,01:33:42.116,-Because... -Why?
01:33:42.199,01:33:47.747,"I've been to a million auditions, and the same thing happens every time where I get interrupted because someone wants to get a sandwich!"
01:33:47.830,01:33:50.458,"Or I'm crying, and they start laughing!"
01:33:50.541,01:33:56.797,"Or there's people sitting in the waiting room, and they're like me but prettier and better at the..."
01:33:56.881,01:33:58.257,Because maybe I'm not good enough!
01:33:58.674,01:34:00.009,"-Yes, you are. -No..."
01:34:01.135,01:34:02.678,"-No, maybe I'm not. -Yes, you are."
01:34:02.762,01:34:03.721,-Maybe I'm not. -You are.
01:34:03.804,01:34:05.097,-Maybe I'm not. -You are.
01:34:07.892,01:34:19.070,"Maybe I'm one of those people that has always wanted to do it, but it's like a pipe dream for me. You know? And then, you said it, you change your dreams, and then you grow up."
01:34:19.320,01:34:21.530,"Maybe I'm one of those people, and I'm not supposed to."
01:34:21.739,01:34:25.951,"And I can go back to school, and I can find something else that I'm supposed to do."
01:34:26.160,01:34:31.415,"'Cause I left to do that, and it's been six years, and I don't want to do it anymore."
01:34:35.336,01:34:36.337,Why?
01:34:39.131,01:34:40.049,Why what?
01:34:40.132,01:34:41.592,Why don't you want to do it anymore?
01:34:44.178,01:34:46.138,'Cause I think it hurts a little bit too much.
01:34:48.724,01:34:49.725,You're a baby.
01:34:51.227,01:34:52.686,I'm not a baby. I'm trying to grow up.
01:34:54.772,01:34:57.108,You have an audition tomorrow at 5:30.
01:34:57.858,01:34:59.568,I'll be out front at 8:00 a.m.
01:35:00.653,01:35:02.655,"You'll be out front or not, I don't know."
01:35:04.615,01:35:05.783,How'd you find me here?
01:35:07.326,01:35:08.869,The house in front of the library.
01:35:52.496,01:35:54.290,"-I got coffee. -Okay, great."
01:36:12.933,01:36:13.767,Mia?
01:36:19.940,01:36:22.318,"Hi, Mia. I'm Amy and this is Frank."
01:36:22.401,01:36:23.611,Hi. How are you?
01:36:23.694,01:36:25.529,-Nice to meet you. -Glad we found you.
01:36:25.988,01:36:26.989,"Me, too."
01:36:28.491,01:36:32.077,"The film shoots in Paris, and we don't have a script."
01:36:35.498,01:36:37.458,We're gonna build the character around the actress.
01:36:37.541,01:36:39.502,It's a three-month rehearsal and a four-month shoot.
01:36:42.171,01:36:43.088,Okay.
01:36:47.718,01:36:48.594,About?
01:36:51.555,01:36:52.389,Anything?
01:36:52.681,01:36:54.808,"Yeah, just tell us a story. You're a storyteller."
01:37:12.660,01:37:14.203,My aunt used to live in Paris.
01:37:19.875,01:37:21.919,I remember she used to come home and she would tell us...

01:37:31.262,01:37:33.806,she told us that she jumped into the river once.
01:37:39.895,01:39:51.318,She smiled Leapt without looking And tumbled into The Seine The water was freezing She spent a month sneezing But said she would do it again Here's to the ones who dream Foolish as they may seem Here's to the hearts that ache Here's to the mess we make She captured a feeling Sky with no ceiling The sunset inside a frame She lived in her liquor And died with a flicker I'll always remember the flame Here's to the ones who dream Foolish as they may seem Here's to the hearts that ache Here's to the mess we make She told me A bit of madness is key To give us new colours to see Who knows where it will lead us?
01:39:51.819,01:41:19.072,And that's why they need us So bring on the rebels The ripples from pebbles The painters and poets and plays And here's to the fools Who dream Crazy as they may seem Here's to the hearts that break Here's to the mess We make I Trace it all back to then Her and the snow and The Seine Smiling through it She said she'd do it Again When do you find out?
