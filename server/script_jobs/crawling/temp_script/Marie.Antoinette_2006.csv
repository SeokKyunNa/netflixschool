00:03:29.584,00:03:34.089,The court of France is not like Vienna.

00:05:56.439,00:05:59.693,We have arrived at Schüttern for the official handover.
00:05:59.693,00:06:04.698,"Then you will be presented to the king and to your fiancé, Louis Auguste."
00:06:12.039,00:06:17.669,"Your Royal Highness, may I present your mistress of the household, Comtesse de Noailles."

00:06:21.131,00:06:22.341,Oh.
00:06:26.303,00:06:27.804,Madame.
00:06:39.774,00:06:46.823,This structure for the handover ceremony has been built precisely astride the borders of the two great lands.
00:06:46.823,00:06:54.581,"You have entered on Austrian soil, you will exit on French as the dauphine of France."
00:06:55.874,00:07:01.004,Now you must bid farewell to your party and leave all of Austria behind.
00:07:08.262,00:07:09.721,Goodbye.
00:07:20.857,00:07:22.067,Um.
00:07:25.987,00:07:27.030,Mops.
00:07:30.325,00:07:33.703,You can have as many French dogs as you like.
00:07:45.424,00:07:52.764,DE NOAILLES: It is a custom that the bride retain nothing belonging to a foreign court.
00:07:52.764,00:07:57.144,An etiquette always observed on such an occasion.
00:09:02.250,00:09:03.543,You're lucky.
00:09:03.543,00:09:05.795,Apparently she's quite beautiful.
00:09:07.755,00:09:11.259,I'll probably end up with someone who looks like a dog.
00:09:11.259,00:09:12.386,Or a horse.
00:09:12.386,00:09:13.845,Or a horse.
00:09:13.845,00:09:16.264,I've heard she's really nice.
00:09:16.264,00:09:19.518,Think they got rabbits here?
00:09:24.356,00:09:25.648,Come on.
00:09:27.067,00:09:30.278,You notice anything strange about me lately?
00:09:33.365,00:09:34.991,WOMAN 1: It's so muddy here.
00:09:34.991,00:09:37.452,WOMAN 2: I know. My stomach feels a little bit sick.
00:09:37.452,00:09:41.081,WOMAN 1: Are you feeling better now?
00:09:41.081,00:09:44.667,I wonder if our doggie is sick.
00:09:44.667,00:09:46.586,Now.
00:09:47.921,00:09:51.132,"Oh, my goodness, it's so uncomfortable underfoot."
00:09:51.132,00:09:53.093,Come on.
00:09:57.556,00:09:59.182,There we are.
00:10:16.699,00:10:18.701,Hey. Heh-heh!
00:10:27.544,00:10:29.421,How is her bosom?
00:10:29.421,00:10:32.924,I have not looked at the archduchess's bosom.
00:10:32.924,00:10:34.134,"Oh, didn't you?"
00:10:34.134,00:10:36.261,It's the first thing I look at.
00:11:03.746,00:11:05.373,The Duc de Choiseul.
00:11:05.373,00:11:08.293,The foreign minister who was instrumental in this union.
00:11:08.293,00:11:12.671,I shall never forget that you were responsible for my happiness.
00:11:12.671,00:11:15.342,And that of France.
00:11:15.342,00:11:16.675,Please.
00:11:30.398,00:11:32.942,Here comes the Austrian.
00:11:32.942,00:11:35.778,I hope you like apple strudel.
00:11:44.162,00:11:48.291,"May I present Madame la Dauphine, Marie Antoinette."
00:11:51.127,00:11:53.421,My dear grandfather king.
00:11:55.256,00:11:56.633,"Welcome, madame."
00:12:08.769,00:12:13.567,"Let me present my grandson, Louis Auguste."
00:12:26.246,00:12:28.164,"Welcome, madame."
00:12:48.309,00:12:51.438,WOMAN: She looks like a child.
00:14:05.553,00:14:06.929,Hello.
00:14:06.929,00:14:09.766,Madame.
00:14:09.766,00:14:10.891,Thank you.
00:14:10.891,00:14:12.435,"GIRL: You're welcome, madame."
00:14:18.191,00:14:19.526,Thanks.
00:14:45.009,00:14:46.177,Oh.
00:15:26.509,00:15:27.719,MARIE: Hello.
00:18:30.735,00:18:32.403,Amen.
00:20:54.754,00:20:58.925,To the dauphin and dauphine of France.
00:20:58.925,00:21:04.847,May you have many healthy children and produce an heir to our throne.
00:22:09.703,00:22:11.538,Amen.
00:22:25.469,00:22:27.513,LOUIS XV: Good luck.
00:22:27.513,00:22:30.016,And good work.
00:22:40.901,00:22:45.405,"MAN: Apparently, nothing happened, Your Majesty."
00:22:45.405,00:22:47.365,Nothing?
00:22:49.451,00:22:51.245,Nothing.
00:22:51.245,00:22:52.746,N-nothing.
00:22:52.746,00:22:54.707,"Oh, dear."
00:23:09.555,00:23:17.313,"Madame, at the morning dressing ceremony, rights of entry are given to members of the high court."
00:23:17.313,00:23:26.697,Major rights to princesses of the blood and mistresses of the household while minor rights to the valets and charges.
00:23:36.498,00:23:46.259,"Anyone with rights of entry may enter at any time, so you must pay attention to acknowledging properly each arrival."
00:23:48.302,00:23:53.473,And you must not reach for anything for the handing of an item to the dauphine is a guarded privilege.
00:23:53.473,00:23:55.393,Must go to the highest rank in the room.
00:23:55.393,00:24:00.731,"For example, the Princesse de Lamballe is a princess of the blood by marriage."
00:24:03.192,00:24:05.194,Madame.
00:24:16.289,00:24:18.207,Thank you.
00:24:20.042,00:24:21.335,It's cold.
00:24:21.335,00:24:22.795,Yes.
00:24:23.921,00:24:25.839,WOMAN: Good morning!
00:24:25.839,00:24:27.465,Oh!
00:24:27.465,00:24:34.348,So now the position must go to the Duchess of Char because she is also a princess of the blood.
00:24:47.111,00:24:48.612,Hello.
00:24:49.905,00:24:56.787,"So now, as a member of the royal family, your sister-in-law, the Comtesse de Provence, must have the honor."
00:25:22.813,00:25:25.232,This is ridiculous.
00:25:25.232,00:25:28.194,"This, madame..."
00:25:28.194,00:25:29.527,is Versailles.
00:27:01.912,00:27:05.207,"So, I've heard you make keys as a hobby?"
00:27:05.207,00:27:06.666,Yes.
00:27:11.380,00:27:13.924,And you enjoy making keys?
00:27:15.301,00:27:16.594,Obviously.
00:27:58.885,00:28:01.930,WOMAN 1: She had to let her servants go.
00:28:03.223,00:28:04.891,You know everyone.
00:28:04.891,00:28:07.853,Comtesse de Noailles looks very out of sorts.
00:28:07.853,00:28:15.194,"I think her husband's been causing a little problem lately, spending far too much time with his stable boys."
00:28:15.194,00:28:17.988,Too much.
00:28:17.988,00:28:21.617,Marie Antoinette looks very pretty tonight.
00:28:22.784,00:28:24.453,LOUIS XVI: Yes.
00:28:24.453,00:28:28.706,"WOMAN 3: Darling, a new life, unfortunately."
00:28:28.706,00:28:33.337,"When you think about it, this poor Marie Antoinette."
00:28:33.337,00:28:34.505,"So young, so..."
00:28:35.839,00:28:38.717,I think she should go back to her country.
00:28:41.303,00:28:43.055,"WOMAN 1: Look at her, so disgusting."
00:28:43.055,00:28:48.561,"MAN: The comtesse is looking rather dour this evening, don't you think?"
00:28:48.561,00:28:51.522,MAN: Can't believe they've brought those ghastly aunts out again.
00:28:51.522,00:28:54.024,Where have they been hiding them all these years?
00:28:55.484,00:28:58.320,"WOMAN 3: Oh, really? This is shocking."
00:28:59.988,00:29:02.616,WOMAN 2: What is she?
00:29:03.783,00:29:06.995,"It's so awful, I can't-- Oh, my goodness."
00:29:06.995,00:29:09.122,Who is she?
00:29:11.625,00:29:14.961,That lady is here to give...
00:29:14.961,00:29:16.796,pleasure to the king.
00:29:16.796,00:29:17.881,Oh.
00:29:20.050,00:29:23.679,"That's du Barry, the king's mistress."
00:29:23.679,00:29:28.934,"She wouldn't be allowed at court, but the king did some maneuvering to secure her a title."
00:29:28.934,00:29:35.232,WOMAN: The one thing I've learned about girls from the gutter is they know their jewels.
00:29:38.318,00:29:39.903,You see that?
00:29:39.903,00:29:42.072,Is this the way people are treating me?
00:29:42.072,00:29:44.575,To the stocks.
00:29:44.575,00:29:46.785,Nobody treats me like a lady here.
00:29:46.785,00:29:49.663,Now she's staring at me.
00:29:49.663,00:29:52.207,She should not be sitting at this table.
00:29:52.207,00:29:56.878,I'll have one-- Pardon.
00:29:56.878,00:29:59.548,Did you hear that?
00:29:59.548,00:30:00.716,She just burped.
00:30:00.716,00:30:02.384,"MAN: Out of the whorehouse, darling."
00:30:02.384,00:30:04.470,WOMAN 1: I don't know who you're referring to.
00:30:04.470,00:30:07.097,WOMAN 2: Everyone at this table is for sale.
00:30:07.097,00:30:08.432,Curls.
00:30:08.432,00:30:11.935,"MAN: Well, she's not the only one at this table, darling."
00:30:11.935,00:30:14.062,Look at this beautiful Marie Antoinette.
00:30:14.062,00:30:16.482,I look like her?
00:30:16.482,00:30:17.941,Mm. A long time ago.
00:30:17.941,00:30:21.737,"Oh, you exaggerate."
00:30:21.737,00:30:24.531,MAN: I suppose she's rather sweet.
00:30:24.531,00:30:27.326,WOMAN: I think she's delightful.
00:30:27.326,00:30:30.245,Be interesting to see how long she lasts.
00:30:41.131,00:30:44.050,"Good afternoon, Your Majesty."
00:30:46.011,00:30:48.514,"How is your grandson, the dauphin?"
00:30:48.514,00:30:50.349,He's off hunting the stag.
00:30:50.349,00:30:52.225,WOMAN: Oh.
00:30:52.225,00:30:55.813,WOMAN 1: She doesn't seem the least bit interested in him.
00:30:55.813,00:30:57.731,WOMAN 2: She is Austrian.
00:30:57.731,00:30:59.899,They're not exactly the warmest people.
00:30:59.899,00:31:01.610,WOMAN 3: But it's true.
00:30:59.899,00:31:03.445,Her brother Joseph is so cold.
00:31:03.445,00:31:07.700,"They say in Austria, that she was with child..."
00:31:13.580,00:31:15.624,What a hunt today.
00:31:16.583,00:31:17.793,Hoo.
00:31:21.046,00:31:23.340,I'm exhausted.
00:32:17.853,00:32:20.230,Would you like some meat?
00:32:26.653,00:32:28.739,MERCY: Your Royal Highness...
00:32:28.739,00:32:35.454,handing out cold meats to a hunting party is not the most becoming conduct for a future queen of France.
00:32:35.454,00:32:38.998,I was just trying to be a nice wife for the dauphin's hunt.
00:32:38.998,00:32:40.876,Surely there's no harm in that.
00:32:40.876,00:32:46.924,"And I received a letter from your mother warning you not to ride, as this is one of the leading causes of miscarriages."
00:32:46.924,00:32:52.137,"Well, as everyone knows, there's no danger of that."
00:32:52.137,00:32:53.346,And it's not my fault.
00:32:53.346,00:32:57.726,Do you realize the consequences of an unconsummated royal marriage?
00:32:57.726,00:32:59.561,That it could be annulled?
00:32:59.561,00:33:02.940,Your mother has asked that you take this matter very seriously.
00:33:02.940,00:33:06.735,And do everything in your power to...
00:33:08.153,00:33:10.530,...inspire the dauphin.
00:33:11.573,00:33:13.867,I'll do what I can.
00:33:13.867,00:33:17.412,Of course I want to please the dauphin and my mother.
00:33:17.412,00:33:20.874,You will have no influence over the king and dauphin without a pregnancy.
00:33:20.874,00:33:23.502,"Madame, you have the alliance to consider."
00:33:23.502,00:33:27.506,Letting everyone down would be my greatest unhappiness.
00:33:28.882,00:33:31.677,I am pleased madame is taking this seriously.
00:33:35.430,00:33:37.098,"Oh, is Mops on his way?"
00:33:37.098,00:33:40.268,"I'm working on it, but..."
00:33:40.268,00:33:45.273,Your Royal Highness has more pressing matters to attend to.
00:33:46.984,00:33:51.488,"Oh, and, uh, I received this letter from your mother."
00:34:01.373,00:34:13.051,MARIA TERESA: Dearest Antoinette: It is clear that the heart of your problems in your new home is your inability to inspire sexual passion in your husband.
00:34:13.051,00:34:20.934,There is no reason a girl with so many charms as you should be in this situation.
00:34:20.934,00:34:36.033,"Remember, you represent the future, and nothing is certain about your place there until the final physical act to crown the Franco-Austrian alliance is performed."
00:35:12.819,00:35:14.654,"Ah, it's cold."
00:35:14.654,00:35:17.323,It is a bit chilly.
00:35:17.323,00:35:18.658,No.
00:35:18.658,00:35:20.410,It's okay.
00:35:24.915,00:35:27.000,Whoo-hoo! Woo...
00:35:27.000,00:35:30.003,Are those your feet?
00:35:30.003,00:35:31.546,Oh.
00:35:36.802,00:35:38.553,Well...
00:35:41.598,00:35:43.475,...sleep well.
00:35:46.603,00:35:48.438,Thank you.
00:35:51.650,00:35:52.901,Night.
00:35:52.901,00:35:54.444,Good night.
00:36:39.238,00:36:41.282,LAMBALLE: Your hair always looks so pretty.
00:36:41.282,00:36:42.701,"MARIE: Oh, do you think so?"
00:36:42.701,00:36:44.077,"LAMBALLE: Yeah, it's gorgeous."
00:36:44.077,00:36:45.829,MARIE: It's not what I'm used to.
00:36:45.829,00:36:47.998,It's so nice to be blond.
00:36:47.998,00:36:50.458,No.
00:36:50.458,00:36:53.586,"This morning, I think, you know-- Did he pull it?"
00:36:53.586,00:36:58.925,LAMBALLE: Léonard must've been in a bad mood because he was pulling my hair so hard.
00:36:58.925,00:37:02.179,"And I want to tell him, you know, it's not my fault if he's had a bad morning."
00:37:02.179,00:37:04.890,Don't take it out on my scalp.
00:37:12.564,00:37:14.816,That was unnecessary.
00:37:15.775,00:37:17.027,Watch it!
00:37:37.463,00:37:39.799,I would love to go to the opera in Paris.
00:37:39.799,00:37:42.928,Why go to the opera when we can listen to the comtesse here?
00:37:42.928,00:37:45.680,Must she sing all night?
00:37:48.474,00:37:51.019,Can't you do something about your wife?
00:37:53.230,00:37:54.647,Madame...
00:37:54.647,00:37:57.067,...shall we retire to make love all night?
00:37:58.777,00:38:01.196,Four times last night wasn't enough.
00:38:14.834,00:38:16.878,Dear Antoinette...
00:38:18.379,00:38:22.217,I am extremely concerned with your situation.
00:38:24.552,00:38:30.142,"Fortunately, the king doesn't show preference for your sister-in-law."
00:38:30.142,00:38:31.601,But what...
00:38:31.601,00:38:33.394,if she...
00:38:33.394,00:38:35.521,becomes pregnant?
00:38:35.521,00:38:43.655,"Also, I have heard that you are not making invitations to Madame du Barry."
00:38:44.697,00:38:52.205,"Snubbing the king's favorite, in your position, is..."
00:38:52.205,00:38:56.001,extremely unwise.
00:38:58.461,00:39:00.672,SOPHIE: Du Barry is dreadful.
00:39:00.672,00:39:03.549,SOPHIE: The way she dresses.
00:39:03.549,00:39:06.552,"VICTOIRE: Yes, she does. And those ridiculous pet monkeys."
00:39:06.552,00:39:08.429,Where does she come from?
00:39:08.429,00:39:10.556,From every bed in Paris.
00:39:10.556,00:39:16.521,"You know, we didn't think she would last long until she married the comte, and then he was conveniently shipped away somewhere."
00:39:16.521,00:39:18.898,She doesn't stay in the boudoir.
00:39:18.898,00:39:20.483,She's political.
00:39:20.483,00:39:22.485,And extremely anti-Choiseul.
00:39:22.485,00:39:27.240,"VICTOIRE: And I don't want to say this, but I don't think that she has greeted you with respect."
00:39:27.240,00:39:28.867,That's just my opinion.
00:39:28.867,00:39:31.703,Ambassador Mercy says I must pay her a visit.
00:39:31.703,00:39:36.916,"Well, if we invited you to tea at the last minute, you wouldn't be able to, would you?"
00:39:40.295,00:39:43.798,She died giving birth to her tenth child.
00:39:43.798,00:39:46.259,VICTOIRE: What a pity. What a pity.
00:39:46.259,00:39:48.761,There was blood all over-- Here comes our little Austrian.
00:39:48.761,00:39:49.929,"Good afternoon, madame."
00:39:49.929,00:39:51.389,Good afternoon.
00:39:51.389,00:39:53.599,"Good afternoon, you look lovely."
00:39:53.599,00:39:55.352,"Oh, thank you."
00:39:55.352,00:39:56.895,Thank you.
00:39:56.895,00:39:59.438,SOPHIE: Look at du Barry.
00:39:59.438,00:40:01.941,Another one of her exotic fantasies?
00:40:01.941,00:40:05.362,SOPHIE: She can't pass a mirror without seducing it.
00:40:05.362,00:40:08.406,Do you think she's wearing enough jewelry?
00:40:08.406,00:40:10.158,Never enough for du Barry.
00:40:10.158,00:40:12.327,SOPHIE: She's coming.
00:40:14.537,00:40:16.373,"Oh, I love your shoes, Victoire."
00:40:16.373,00:40:18.750,"Oh, why, thank you. I got them from Christian in Paris."
00:40:18.750,00:40:20.085,"Oh, I must call on him."
00:40:20.085,00:40:22.128,"VICTOIRE: Yes, you must."
00:41:13.430,00:41:18.268,Madame du Barry would like to offer you some diamonds.
00:41:18.268,00:41:21.520,I have enough diamonds.
00:41:21.520,00:41:25.733,Snubbing the king's favorite is publicly criticizing the king's behavior.
00:41:25.733,00:41:27.986,All you need do is say a few words to her.
00:41:27.986,00:41:30.363,Because of rank she is not allowed to speak to you first.
00:41:30.363,00:41:32.657,I certainly have nothing to say to her.
00:41:32.657,00:41:34.909,Why should I approve of his cavorting with a harlot?
00:41:34.909,00:41:36.369,Your Royal Highness.
00:41:36.369,00:41:37.703,"Well, that's what she is."
00:41:37.703,00:41:41.416,Everyone knows that she's from a brothel and that title was bought for her.
00:41:41.416,00:41:44.336,Your mother and I are very concerned.
00:41:44.336,00:41:47.922,Du Barry has been complaining to the king that you will not address her.
00:41:47.922,00:41:50.508,And you cannot afford to fall out of favor with the king.
00:41:50.508,00:41:55.972,Especially as your marriage...
00:41:57.390,00:41:59.892,Fine. I'll talk to her.
00:42:22.581,00:42:25.126,There are a lot of people at Versailles today.
00:42:26.085,00:42:27.420,"Yes, there are."
00:42:56.908,00:42:59.577,Those are my last words to that woman.
00:43:01.704,00:43:03.164,Meow.
00:43:03.164,00:43:04.332,Meow.
00:43:04.332,00:43:05.624,Ooh!
00:43:16.594,00:43:20.348,"Ooh, the first mechanical locks were made of wood."
00:43:20.348,00:43:21.974,Oh.
00:43:25.811,00:43:31.150,Records show them in use some 4000 years ago in Egypt.
00:43:31.150,00:43:32.569,Huh.
00:44:12.858,00:44:13.901,Any good fans?
00:44:13.901,00:44:15.820,Mm.
00:44:15.820,00:44:17.822,Evening or daytime?
00:44:18.906,00:44:20.325,These are so du Barry.
00:44:22.076,00:44:24.579,Do you like these for hair?
00:44:24.579,00:44:25.955,"LAMBALLE: Oh, it's beautiful."
00:44:25.955,00:44:27.748,MARIE: You don't think it's too much?
00:44:27.748,00:44:30.209,Maybe one. Yeah.
00:44:30.209,00:44:31.419,Or in white?
00:44:31.419,00:44:34.547,"Can we get these in white, maybe?"
00:44:34.547,00:44:36.257,I don't know if I like that one.
00:44:36.257,00:44:41.220,"LAMBALLE: Oh, well-- Do you want these, too?"
00:44:41.220,00:44:42.555,"Yeah, but in pink."
00:44:42.555,00:44:44.307,MARIE: Two in pink.
00:44:45.933,00:44:48.727,"Has madame, uh, read the brief on our current situation?"
00:44:48.727,00:44:51.022,"No, I haven't read it yet."
00:44:51.022,00:44:53.232,Can you just tell me about it?
00:44:55.109,00:44:59.947,"Well, the, uh, reforms in Poland by King Poniatowski have led to civil war."
00:44:59.947,00:45:09.123,"Uh, the Russians and the Austrians have taken over a third of Poland which is, of course, distressing, as Poland is a friend and ally of France."
00:45:11.042,00:45:15.046,Which sleeve do you like?
00:45:15.046,00:45:18.049,Have you been paying any attention?
00:45:18.049,00:45:22.303,Your mother is relying on you to smooth over this crisis.
00:45:22.303,00:45:25.473,Where will I be if there's a rupture between our two families?
00:45:26.974,00:45:30.061,Am I to be Austrian or the dauphine of France?
00:45:32.146,00:45:33.814,You must be both.
00:45:37.652,00:45:40.488,"VICTOIRE: Well, I heard that she bought a boy."
00:45:40.488,00:45:42.031,SOPHIE: No.
00:45:42.031,00:45:47.579,I heard she found a little peasant boy by the side of the street and took him in like a stray dog.
00:45:47.579,00:45:50.540,"Well, it's not as if she can have one of her own."
00:45:50.540,00:45:56.254,"Well, maybe if she spent less time with Lamballe and more time with her husband, there wouldn't be a problem."
00:45:56.254,00:45:57.672,Mm.
00:45:57.672,00:46:02.843,"Well, let's not forget she is an Austrian spy, and I can't imagine that's very warm in the bedroom."
00:46:05.179,00:46:07.515,"Come, my little truffle cake."
00:46:07.515,00:46:09.058,Mwah.
00:46:09.058,00:46:11.394,I'm going to ravage you.
00:46:11.394,00:46:12.811,Will you come back right away?
00:46:12.811,00:46:14.480,"Yes, my sweet."
00:46:14.480,00:46:17.316,Just a quick hunting excursion.
00:46:17.316,00:46:25.658,I will be humiliated before the court and the public if your brother's new wife becomes pregnant before I do.
00:46:25.658,00:46:29.495,"When I return from Saint-Cloud, you can be sure..."
00:46:29.495,00:46:31.539,that I will resume my regime.
00:46:31.539,00:46:36.168,And hopefully everything will go...swimmingly.
00:47:14.332,00:47:18.419,I have absolutely no intention of breaking the alliance with Austria.
00:47:18.419,00:47:20.672,"I am very relieved to hear that, Your Majesty."
00:47:20.672,00:47:23.424,But what on earth is going on with that young couple?
00:47:23.424,00:47:26.385,Hm! It's a disaster.
00:47:26.385,00:47:30.222,Send for Dr. Lassonne to visit them.
00:47:30.222,00:47:32.391,"Yes, of course."
00:47:34.602,00:47:37.980,Do you find your body responsive?
00:47:37.980,00:47:39.856,What?
00:47:39.856,00:47:43.068,Do you find your body responsive?
00:47:44.403,00:47:46.030,Hm.
00:47:50.660,00:47:53.454,LASSONNE: What do you eat for breakfast?
00:47:53.454,00:47:55.498,LOUIS XVI: Hot chocolate.
00:47:55.498,00:47:57.249,LASSONNE: Hm?
00:47:57.249,00:47:59.168,LASSONNE: Mm.
00:48:31.908,00:48:34.078,Hello?
00:48:34.078,00:48:36.163,"Hello, Yolande."
00:48:37.914,00:48:39.291,"Mwah, mwah."
00:48:39.291,00:48:41.419,How lovely to see you.
00:48:41.419,00:48:44.756,"Yes. Um, this is the Duchesse of Polignac."
00:48:44.756,00:48:46.591,Hello.
00:48:46.591,00:48:48.008,We haven't seen you for a while.
00:48:48.008,00:48:50.135,I know.
00:48:48.008,00:48:52.012,"I've been in St. Petersburg, where I met Dimitri."
00:48:53.639,00:48:55.266,Isn't he divine?
00:48:56.392,00:48:58.227,Have you ever been with a Russian?
00:48:58.227,00:49:00.521,"No, I-- They're so bossy."
00:49:00.521,00:49:02.690,Look how fat the marquis has gotten.
00:49:02.690,00:49:05.192,Hope he doesn't break the chair.
00:49:05.192,00:49:08.446,Is he still sleeping with Camille? Ugh!
00:49:08.446,00:49:11.407,"Anyway, I must be off."
00:49:11.407,00:49:13.826,"Adieu, chérie. Au revoir."
00:49:13.826,00:49:15.119,Au revoir.
00:49:51.029,00:49:52.698,Quiet.
00:49:52.698,00:49:55.451,Applause is not usually permitted at court performances.
00:49:55.451,00:49:59.037,Oh! Why not?
00:49:59.037,00:50:01.707,"Clap, clap."
00:50:01.707,00:50:03.668,Clap.
00:51:23.873,00:51:33.049,MARIA TERESA: Dearest Antoinette: I'm pleased to tell you how wonderful your brothers and sisters are doing in their marriages.
00:51:33.049,00:51:39.055,"Maria Carolina is pregnant, expecting her first child in June."
00:51:39.055,00:51:45.394,"And Ferdinand is enchanted with Beatrice, having made her his wife at once."
00:51:45.394,00:51:55.696,"All this news, which should fill me with contentment, is diminished by reflections on your dangerous situation."
00:51:55.696,00:52:01.619,Everything depends on the wife if she is willing and sweet.
00:52:01.619,00:52:14.090,"I can't repeat enough the importance for you to employ charm and patience, never ill humor, to remedy this unfortunate situation."
00:52:14.090,00:52:21.137,"Remember, nothing is certain about your place there until an heir is produced."
00:52:43.452,00:52:45.955,Ow.
00:52:45.955,00:52:47.123,It's all right.
00:52:50.751,00:52:52.586,Mm.
00:53:10.729,00:53:12.188,I'm sorry.
00:53:12.188,00:53:14.566,That's...
00:53:14.566,00:53:15.818,I'm sorry.
00:53:15.818,00:53:17.193,It's all right.
00:53:20.739,00:53:22.198,Good night.
00:53:22.198,00:53:23.617,Good night.
00:53:52.063,00:53:57.109,Your Majesties are requested at the delivery of Comtesse de Provence.
00:54:07.078,00:54:09.830,"SCARPITTA: Bravo, bravo."
00:54:09.830,00:54:11.289,"WOMAN: Oh, wonderful!"
00:54:11.289,00:54:13.375,DOCTOR: It's a healthy baby boy.
00:54:13.375,00:54:15.293,"DE PROVENCE: Oh, my God."
00:54:15.293,00:54:17.253,How happy I am.
00:54:19.381,00:54:20.966,LOUIS XVI: Let me see my nephew.
00:54:20.966,00:54:23.052,The new Duc d'Angoulême.
00:54:24.220,00:54:26.097,Congratulations.
00:54:26.097,00:54:30.266,It's the first Bourbon prince of his generation.
00:54:30.266,00:54:32.770,He's so beautiful.
00:54:34.396,00:54:37.691,WOMAN 1: It's barren. What do you expect?
00:54:37.691,00:54:41.403,WOMAN 2: When will you give us an heir?
00:54:41.403,00:54:43.822,I hear she's frigid.
00:55:21.777,00:55:23.028,Oh.
00:55:23.028,00:55:24.822,Oh.
00:56:07.072,00:56:08.532,"ALL: Oh, wow. Ooh."
00:56:08.532,00:56:10.951,I like the pink.
00:56:10.951,00:56:12.244,Mm.
00:56:20.336,00:56:22.504,Ooh.
00:56:25.132,00:56:26.550,"Ooh-- Ooh, I love this."
00:56:41.481,00:56:42.983,Could we get more champagne?
00:57:37.454,00:57:39.123,Monsieur Léonard.
00:57:53.178,00:57:55.139,Hm. Ravishing.
00:57:59.143,00:58:01.270,"Oh, Léonard!"
00:58:01.270,00:58:03.563,You're the best.
00:58:03.563,00:58:04.856,"It's not too much, is it?"
00:58:04.856,00:58:06.608,No. No.
00:58:32.176,00:58:35.137,We should all go to Paris for the masked ball.
00:58:35.137,00:58:37.722,We're not allowed to go without a formal reception.
00:58:39.057,00:58:44.355,"Well, if it's a masked ball, no one would have to know, would they?"
00:58:47.024,00:58:48.150,Shh!
00:58:48.150,00:58:50.361,Shh!
00:58:52.154,00:58:54.781,Aah!
00:58:54.781,00:58:56.700,DE POLIGNAC: Sorry.
00:59:23.143,00:59:24.520,Which way?
00:59:27.523,00:59:29.024,Come on.
00:59:32.403,00:59:34.238,MARIE: Follow Duchesse de Polignac.
01:00:04.560,01:00:06.562,Excuse me.
01:00:06.562,01:00:08.480,Excuse me.
01:00:11.483,01:00:13.360,Whoo-hoo!
01:00:34.923,01:00:37.301,"Where do you come from, monsieur?"
01:00:38.218,01:00:39.386,Versailles.
01:00:39.386,01:00:41.555,Oh.
01:00:41.555,01:00:46.351,"And, uh, has the dauphin done the deed yet?"
01:00:47.894,01:00:49.187,What?
01:00:49.187,01:00:52.232,Has the dauphin deflowered the dauphine?
01:00:52.232,01:00:53.525,Excuse me?
01:00:53.525,01:00:56.153,"I would love to do the honors, you know."
01:01:23.847,01:01:25.223,Doesn't interest me.
01:01:25.223,01:01:26.558,Cheers.
01:01:40.947,01:01:43.241,DE POLIGNAC: Look at that sword.
01:01:43.241,01:01:45.369,I'd like to see what he could do with that.
01:01:47.745,01:01:49.998,"DE POLIGNAC: Oh, who's he talking to?"
01:01:49.998,01:01:52.417,Hideous dress she's wearing.
01:02:00.425,01:02:02.719,Pretend you're having a really good time.
01:02:05.347,01:02:07.140,Have fun.
01:02:09.351,01:02:10.602,Do I know you?
01:02:10.602,01:02:13.689,No. I don't think so.
01:02:15.607,01:02:18.694,Are you making any progress with her?
01:02:19.695,01:02:21.112,Possibly.
01:02:22.698,01:02:24.616,Are you going to tell me who you are?
01:02:27.911,01:02:29.746,Are you?
01:02:29.746,01:02:32.416,Count Fersen of the Swedish army.
01:02:33.875,01:02:35.377,Count Fersen.
01:02:42.759,01:02:45.095,WOMAN: That's the dauphine.
01:03:03.572,01:03:05.657,We must go home.
01:03:05.657,01:03:08.034,No. Let's just stay a little longer.
01:03:08.034,01:03:10.579,Please. Let's go. Come on.
01:03:10.579,01:03:12.289,Finally.
01:03:15.500,01:03:17.877,MARIE: Do you know of Count Fersen?
01:03:18.920,01:03:21.339,"Yes! Count Fersen, of course."
01:03:21.339,01:03:23.592,Beatrice de la Falaise was with him last summer.
01:03:23.592,01:03:25.552,"He's got quite a reputation, you know."
01:03:25.552,01:03:28.764,Comtesse de Sevigny.
01:05:14.244,01:05:15.704,MARIE: Good morning.
01:05:17.121,01:05:18.248,What is it?
01:05:18.248,01:05:20.291,MERCY: The king has fallen ill.
01:05:20.291,01:05:21.710,Is it serious?
01:05:21.710,01:05:23.294,Smallpox.
01:05:24.796,01:05:27.131,He doesn't have long.
01:05:27.131,01:05:32.470,"You know, we cannot take his confession while he has a mistress."
01:05:36.683,01:05:39.728,It will be taken care of.
01:05:39.728,01:05:46.568,"LOUIS XV: Madame du Barry, I'm sick and know what I have to do."
01:05:47.985,01:05:56.578,"Rest assured, I shall always have the most tender feelings of friendship for you."
01:06:27.484,01:06:30.027,Bring me du Barry.
01:06:31.195,01:06:33.531,"VERGENNES: She is gone, Your Majesty."
01:06:49.046,01:06:50.924,MAN 1: The king is dead.
01:06:50.924,01:06:53.927,Long live Louis XVI.
01:06:53.927,01:06:55.595,MAN 2: Your Majesty.
01:06:55.595,01:06:57.138,God bless you.
01:07:00.183,01:07:03.520,"Your Majesties, I am at your loyal service."
01:07:14.405,01:07:16.741,"Dear God, guide us and protect us."
01:07:16.741,01:07:19.452,We are too young to reign.
01:07:25.249,01:07:30.213,May God crown you with a crown of glory.
01:08:20.388,01:08:23.433,How marvelous!
01:08:23.433,01:08:25.727,Here are two for me and the queen.
01:08:25.727,01:08:27.812,"Happy birthday, darling!"
01:08:34.485,01:08:36.738,"WOMAN: One, two, three."
01:08:36.738,01:08:39.407,ALL: Happy birthday!
01:08:49.250,01:08:53.630,"Happy birthday, darling."
01:08:59.594,01:09:01.012,"Big stakes! Come on, now!"
01:09:02.472,01:09:04.307,That one.
01:09:04.307,01:09:05.934,That one's for me.
01:09:07.644,01:09:09.270,What's coming?
01:09:14.901,01:09:16.527,LÉONARD: Amazing.
01:09:27.246,01:09:28.581,Here are two.
01:09:30.333,01:09:31.793,So pretty!
01:09:42.137,01:09:43.346,Oh...
01:09:43.346,01:09:45.682,"Oh, Léonard."
01:09:45.682,01:09:47.183,Thank you.
01:09:49.894,01:09:51.437,"Okay, come around to the salon."
01:09:51.437,01:09:53.439,Mm-hm.
01:09:53.439,01:09:54.649,Le beau Julian.
01:09:54.649,01:09:56.233,Mm-hm.
01:09:56.233,01:09:57.360,Marvelous!
01:09:57.360,01:09:59.236,I've heard he likes men as well.
01:09:59.236,01:10:01.656,No. No. It's not true.
01:10:01.656,01:10:04.034,Do you want some cherry?
01:10:06.619,01:10:09.455,I love your hair.
01:10:09.455,01:10:11.207,Everything.
01:10:11.207,01:10:13.250,DE POLIGNAC: That's fantastic.
01:10:13.250,01:10:15.336,LÉONARD: It's full of secrets.
01:10:23.594,01:10:25.763,"You're winning, I hope."
01:10:28.183,01:10:29.767,"Madame, it's quite late."
01:10:29.767,01:10:31.978,I think it's time for the dealers to return to Paris.
01:10:31.978,01:10:34.856,"You said we could play, but you never specified for how long."
01:10:34.856,01:10:36.191,You're worthless.
01:10:36.191,01:10:37.358,I won again!
01:10:39.235,01:10:40.570,Give me my chips.
01:10:40.570,01:10:42.238,How'd you get so good at this game?
01:10:42.238,01:10:44.074,Good night.
01:10:44.074,01:10:46.492,We're gonna watch the sunrise.
01:10:46.492,01:10:48.786,I'd rather get some much-needed sleep.
01:10:48.786,01:10:52.123,"Oh, have you ever watched the sunrise?"
01:10:52.123,01:10:54.250,"When I rise early for the hunt, my dear."
01:10:54.250,01:10:56.127,That doesn't count.
01:10:56.127,01:10:59.005,Try not to lose all our whole fortune.
01:10:59.005,01:11:00.256,Mwah.
01:11:00.256,01:11:01.591,MAN: On a roll.
01:11:01.591,01:11:03.718,Oh.
01:11:06.054,01:11:07.471,I'm taking off.
01:11:07.471,01:11:09.974,That's impressive.
01:11:14.353,01:11:16.397,DE POLIGNAC: Wait! Wait!
01:11:16.397,01:11:18.608,Wait! Spin with me!
01:11:18.608,01:11:20.068,Wait!
01:11:23.154,01:11:24.363,Come along.
01:11:26.241,01:11:28.201,I think I've fallen.
01:11:28.201,01:11:29.702,Oh!
01:11:33.289,01:11:34.707,"Come on. Come on, people."
01:11:34.707,01:11:36.459,"Move, move, move, move, move."
01:11:53.768,01:11:57.939,Isn't that the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?
01:11:57.939,01:11:59.274,Wow.
01:12:02.902,01:12:04.154,Happy birthday.
01:12:04.154,01:12:05.613,DE PROVENCE: Happy birthday.
01:12:05.613,01:12:07.865,Cheers. For the birthday girl.
01:12:07.865,01:12:09.826,To the new day.
01:12:10.994,01:12:12.703,And the next one.
01:12:12.703,01:12:15.290,I think I have a fly in my champagne.
01:13:56.849,01:14:00.895,I would like to plant oaks all along these paths.
01:14:00.895,01:14:02.646,How long will that take?
01:14:02.646,01:14:08.611,"It will take, uh, two weeks, uh, to get them, but, uh, they will be quite small."
01:14:10.280,01:14:12.282,What if I want them that size?
01:14:12.282,01:14:15.368,"Ho-ho, it will take at least three years."
01:14:15.368,01:14:16.744,Three years?
01:14:16.744,01:14:18.955,"Well, can't they bring in bigger ones?"
01:14:18.955,01:14:20.873,"Well, I can see."
01:14:25.586,01:14:30.383,"Your Majesty, you have spent over 50,000 already this month."
01:14:30.383,01:14:32.885,There is nothing left to go to your charities.
01:14:32.885,01:14:34.804,Oh.
01:14:34.804,01:14:37.265,Léonard is here to fit your new wigs.
01:14:37.265,01:14:39.142,I'll get the small trees.
01:14:39.142,01:14:42.812,And I'll ask Louis for the money for the Young Mothers' Fund.
01:14:49.485,01:14:53.489,The Americans are asking for help in their revolution.
01:14:55.074,01:15:00.830,"Well, I can't exactly see assisting those who are rejecting their sovereign."
01:15:00.830,01:15:04.541,But it would make a strong statement to England.
01:15:04.541,01:15:06.461,Can our finances take the strain?
01:15:06.461,01:15:09.172,"Oh, taxes will be raised slightly."
01:15:09.172,01:15:15.386,I recommend we help our American brothers and show the rest of Europe our strength.
01:15:17.763,01:15:20.016,"Alright, then."
01:15:20.016,01:15:22.268,Send funds to America.
01:15:25.104,01:15:27.190,Um...
01:15:42.288,01:15:46.000,"Madame, your brother, the emperor, is in the salon waiting for you."
01:15:46.000,01:15:49.086,He-- He's here? Thank you.
01:15:58.637,01:16:00.431,Have you come to take me home?
01:16:00.431,01:16:02.892,"Unfortunately, I can't kidnap the queen of France."
01:16:04.185,01:16:06.979,Is your hair quite tall enough today?
01:16:06.979,01:16:09.482,Maybe you can keep a pet in there or something.
01:16:10.858,01:16:12.818,Oh.
01:16:12.818,01:16:15.738,The emperor of China sent me this tea.
01:16:15.738,01:16:17.365,Well.
01:16:17.365,01:16:19.783,Watch the flower.
01:16:23.246,01:16:24.539,Isn't it divine?
01:16:25.915,01:16:27.958,Yes.
01:16:30.461,01:16:32.213,It's jasmine.
01:16:37.051,01:16:38.261,Mm.
01:16:45.726,01:16:54.818,"As your brother, I have to lecture you about your constant gambling and choice of friends, like the Duchesse de Polignac."
01:16:54.818,01:16:57.988,"I mean, do you really think she's the proper lady-in-waiting for a queen?"
01:16:57.988,01:17:00.908,But she's fun.
01:17:00.908,01:17:02.577,And your constant parties.
01:17:02.577,01:17:07.664,"I mean, they can hardly leave you enough time to spend alone with your husband."
01:17:07.664,01:17:10.042,I'm sure our mother has worried you.
01:17:10.042,01:17:14.046,"Yes. Well, of course she has."
01:17:14.046,01:17:15.465,Oh.
01:17:16.840,01:17:19.969,I think I'm gonna talk to young Louis.
01:17:35.985,01:17:37.487,Magnificent.
01:17:42.783,01:17:46.162,We have a female elephant in our Austrian menagerie.
01:17:47.413,01:17:49.624,"Well, perhaps we could arrange a marriage."
01:17:53.586,01:17:55.421,So...
01:17:55.421,01:17:59.509,I thought we could have a little talk about the marriage bed.
01:18:01.844,01:18:04.388,The doctor said I was fit.
01:18:04.388,01:18:06.474,Good.
01:18:06.474,01:18:08.434,What goes on exactly?
01:18:15.274,01:18:19.111,I understand you have a certain passion for locks.
01:18:19.111,01:18:20.571,Yes.
01:18:20.571,01:18:29.746,"Well, sometimes when a key doesn't quite fit-- JOSEPH: The problem is only that the king and queen of France are complete blunderers."
01:18:29.746,01:18:33.083,There's nothing really wrong with Louis XVI.
01:18:33.083,01:18:37.713,"Everything works, just not at the right time."
01:18:37.713,01:18:43.219,"I think after our conversation, the great work will be accomplished."
01:19:18.795,01:19:20.464,MARIE: Oh!
01:19:27.221,01:19:29.640,MAN: Very warm in here.
01:19:29.640,01:19:32.809,WOMAN: I can't even believe she's getting enough air.
01:19:43.904,01:19:46.198,Oh!
01:19:49.493,01:19:51.454,WOMAN: Is it a boy?
01:19:52.747,01:19:54.331,"It's a girl, look."
01:19:54.331,01:19:57.084,She's unconscious.
01:19:57.084,01:19:58.961,"Please, the queen needs air."
01:19:58.961,01:20:01.130,Excuse me. Excuse me.
01:20:01.130,01:20:02.590,LOUIS XVI: Excuse me.
01:20:02.590,01:20:05.134,Get back. Back.
01:20:05.134,01:20:07.303,"DE NOAILLES: Everybody, please."
01:20:07.303,01:20:08.638,Get back.
01:20:20.983,01:20:22.234,"Oh, she's beautiful."
01:20:25.821,01:20:28.574,WOMAN 1: You are adorable.
01:20:28.574,01:20:29.784,WOMAN 2: It's a girl.
01:20:34.955,01:20:36.915,Poor little girl.
01:20:36.915,01:20:42.672,"You are not what was desired, but you are no less dear to me."
01:20:44.256,01:20:52.389,"A boy would be the son of France, but you, Marie Thérèse, shall be mine."
01:20:52.389,01:20:54.684,Come look.
01:20:55.934,01:20:58.437,"Oh, she's so small."
01:20:59.522,01:21:00.815,Look at her hands.
01:21:12.702,01:21:14.286,I would like to feed her myself.
01:21:14.286,01:21:16.955,"But, madame, we have the nurse for that."
01:21:16.955,01:21:21.084,"And you know, it's not a good idea in your fragile condition."
01:21:23.462,01:21:24.963,Madame.
01:21:32.012,01:21:36.559,"May I present you with your new retreat, the Petit Trianon."
01:21:38.394,01:21:39.603,Thank you.
01:22:57.222,01:23:02.686,I want something more simple. Natural.
01:23:02.686,01:23:04.563,To wear in the garden.
01:23:17.284,01:23:19.954,MARIE: Are you getting food for the little lamb?
01:23:19.954,01:23:21.079,Let's feed the lamb.
01:23:21.079,01:23:23.165,"Marie Thérèse, come here."
01:23:23.165,01:23:25.125,It's a flower.
01:23:25.125,01:23:27.837,You do it. You do it.
01:23:27.837,01:23:29.505,You feed the lamb.
01:23:31.006,01:23:32.382,Oh...
01:23:36.512,01:23:39.306,"Oh, little lamby."
01:23:54.864,01:23:57.616,Uh? Ooh.
01:23:58.868,01:24:01.370,Beautiful.
01:24:01.370,01:24:04.039,What is this? It's an egg.
01:24:05.374,01:24:08.669,Welcome to my little village.
01:24:08.669,01:24:10.671,Really special.
01:24:13.089,01:24:14.884,DE POLIGNAC: Hello.
01:24:14.884,01:24:18.762,"Oh, look, the chickens are out. Fabulous."
01:24:18.762,01:24:20.764,"Oh, the lilies look so beautiful."
01:24:20.764,01:24:23.475,It's heavenly.
01:24:23.475,01:24:26.395,"DE POLIGNAC: Come on, you little chickens."
01:24:26.395,01:24:28.146,"Oh, look at those little things. Hello."
01:24:28.146,01:24:30.190,LAMBALLE: That one's named after me.
01:24:30.190,01:24:34.319,"MARIE: Oh, this is my favorite, all the fresh herbs. They smell so good."
01:24:34.319,01:24:38.490,"DE POLIGNAC: You've got to brush dirt off, but they're quite clean after that."
01:24:38.490,01:24:42.452,"Oh, we must do this more often."
01:24:45.039,01:24:46.916,Where'd you get this from?
01:24:46.916,01:24:49.793,"Oh, wait till you try this milk."
01:24:49.793,01:24:52.462,"DE POLIGNAC: Oh, what beautiful porcelain."
01:24:52.462,01:24:54.965,LAMBALLE: I don't think that one's very good.
01:24:57.551,01:24:58.886,One of these.
01:25:00.596,01:25:02.472,MARIE: You must try the milk.
01:25:02.472,01:25:03.766,Thank you.
01:25:09.145,01:25:17.153,"MARIE: Rousseau says, If we assume man has been corrupted by an artificial civilization, what is the natural state?"
01:25:17.153,01:25:20.616,The state of nature from which he has been removed?
01:25:21.992,01:25:32.168,"Imagine wandering up and down the forest, without industry, without speech, and without home."
01:25:51.605,01:25:54.566,Let's get a blue flower.
01:25:54.566,01:25:56.443,"Yeah, bleu."
01:25:58.278,01:25:59.488,Mmm.
01:26:00.656,01:26:02.074,Beautiful.
01:26:17.380,01:26:27.933,"MERCY: No, I think, uh, perceived austerity must be encouraged, but I'm afraid the queen has a somewhat artistic temperament, which, uh, needs nourishing."
01:26:27.933,01:26:29.309,May I speak to you?
01:26:29.309,01:26:31.770,"Yes. Uh, excuse me, Father."
01:26:33.271,01:26:39.402,"We have not received any invitation by the queen, which is customary to our rank."
01:26:39.402,01:26:46.535,"I'm afraid the queen is not well enough for formal entertaining, but I will speak with her, madame."
01:26:46.535,01:26:55.836,But-- How can we be expected to live in a place without any certainty of our position?
01:26:55.836,01:26:57.587,I don't understand.
01:26:57.587,01:27:01.091,The Duchesse de Char was very angry.
01:27:01.091,01:27:03.677,But this is my escape from all the protocol.
01:27:03.677,01:27:07.139,"Raumont, amongst others, was complaining."
01:27:07.139,01:27:12.728,"Well, we'll invite them to the theater for my first performance."
01:27:12.728,01:27:14.479,We'll need an audience.
01:27:14.479,01:27:15.814,Splendid.
01:27:59.233,01:28:00.776,Bravo!
01:28:02.402,01:28:04.821,LOUIS: Bravo!
01:28:04.821,01:28:06.156,Bravo!
01:28:08.242,01:28:11.661,"And in the end, I don't know how they go out."
01:28:11.661,01:28:13.538,It's always raining there.
01:28:13.538,01:28:14.664,It's always raining.
01:28:14.664,01:28:16.583,"They are cheerful, I must admit."
01:28:17.960,01:28:19.335,There's someone to see you.
01:28:19.335,01:28:20.712,"Oh, who?"
01:28:27.343,01:28:28.887,Good afternoon.
01:28:28.887,01:28:32.224,You've come to pay me a visit.
01:28:32.224,01:28:34.601,Have you seen our little Marie Thérèse today?
01:28:34.601,01:28:35.936,She's been married off.
01:28:35.936,01:28:37.896,Can't we at least wait until she's talking?
01:28:37.896,01:28:40.023,If you insist.
01:28:40.023,01:28:42.067,Come home.
01:28:40.023,01:28:43.860,We're having a ball for the soldiers who fought in America.
01:28:43.860,01:28:45.320,I will.
01:28:48.698,01:28:51.618,I hope there are some handsome generals.
01:28:51.618,01:28:54.955,"They've been away from women a long time, you know."
01:28:54.955,01:28:57.707,MAN: May I also present Comte d'Estaing.
01:28:59.042,01:29:02.045,Excellent victory on the capture of Grenada.
01:29:02.045,01:29:03.672,Excellent.
01:29:05.299,01:29:06.758,Congratulations.
01:29:08.051,01:29:12.430,"Your Majesty, may I present Colonel Smythe."
01:29:14.474,01:29:17.352,May I also present Count Fersen.
01:29:19.688,01:29:21.106,Count Fersen.
01:29:21.106,01:29:23.399,Pleasure's all mine.
01:29:25.652,01:29:27.196,"D'ARTOIS: Thank you, sir. Thank you."
01:29:27.196,01:29:29.156,DE PROVENCE: What is this?
01:29:29.156,01:29:32.034,D'ARTOIS: It's a wild strawberry. Try it.
01:29:33.910,01:29:37.914,Honestly. The Marriage of Figaro. You'd love it.
01:29:37.914,01:29:40.334,The servants take over the house.
01:29:40.334,01:29:42.211,I-i-it's superb.
01:29:42.211,01:29:44.713,The women were carrying the verses around on their fans.
01:29:44.713,01:29:47.132,Best thing I've seen for years.
01:29:47.132,01:29:48.884,LAMBALLE: I think we saw it together.
01:29:48.884,01:29:51.220,DE PROVENCE: It was over three hours.
01:29:51.220,01:29:54.056,"Cheers, everybody."
01:29:54.056,01:29:55.640,To our queen.
01:29:55.640,01:29:56.933,ALL: Salut!
01:29:56.933,01:29:59.019,D'ARTOIS: Have a good evening.
01:29:59.019,01:30:01.313,And to Raumont for bringing the oysters.
01:30:01.313,01:30:03.815,"DE PROVENCE: Ah, to Raumont for the oysters."
01:30:03.815,01:30:06.526,And to Lamballe for bringing the flowers.
01:30:06.526,01:30:08.237,"For the flowers, beautiful flowers."
01:30:08.237,01:30:11.447,And to Fersen for coming all the way from Sweden.
01:30:11.447,01:30:12.741,"Ah, yes."
01:30:12.741,01:30:14.326,DE PROVENCE: All the way from Sweden.
01:30:14.326,01:30:17.996,"That is a very long journey, I must say."
01:30:17.996,01:30:20.874,How long was it?
01:30:20.874,01:30:23.043,"Yes, 10 days is a very long time."
01:30:23.043,01:30:25.587,"Personally, I can't travel that much myself."
01:30:26.880,01:30:28.464,DE PROVENCE: Far too long.
01:30:28.464,01:30:30.342,DE POLIGNAC: I must show you this trick.
01:30:30.342,01:30:35.264,"Everybody, lick your finger, and then rub it around the rim of the glass."
01:30:35.264,01:30:37.473,LAMBALLE: Beautiful.
01:30:37.473,01:30:40.185,DE PROVENCE: A horrible sound.
01:30:40.185,01:30:42.604,It's like angels.
01:30:42.604,01:30:43.980,It's very pretty.
01:30:43.980,01:30:45.774,"It is pretty, isn't it?"
01:30:47.441,01:30:50.570,"DE POLIGNAC: It's very spiritual, really, isn't it?"
01:30:51.947,01:30:54.616,When was the last time you went to Mass?
01:30:56.201,01:30:59.329,ALL: Of sorts.
01:30:59.329,01:31:00.956,LAMBALLE: Ask another question.
01:31:00.956,01:31:02.540,FERSEN: I can ask another question?
01:31:02.540,01:31:05.168,Am I a male?
01:31:05.168,01:31:06.460,MARIE: No.
01:31:06.460,01:31:08.630,DE PROVENCE: Partially.
01:31:09.798,01:31:11.341,MARIE: That's terrible.
01:31:11.341,01:31:12.842,"Oh, that's so mean."
01:31:12.842,01:31:15.053,"My turn, it's my turn."
01:31:15.053,01:31:16.470,Am I a woman?
01:31:16.470,01:31:18.640,Am I a soldier?
01:31:18.640,01:31:21.643,Am-- Am I-- Do I write music?
01:31:21.643,01:31:23.270,Am I a vegetable?
01:31:23.270,01:31:24.520,FERSEN: Yes. Good question.
01:31:24.520,01:31:26.273,ALL: Yes.
01:31:26.273,01:31:28.400,Am I...
01:31:29.776,01:31:31.069,from the ancient world?
01:31:31.069,01:31:33.780,Am I here?
01:31:33.780,01:31:35.449,"DE PROVENCE: No, thank God."
01:31:35.449,01:31:37.617,Am I...
01:31:37.617,01:31:39.161,present now?
01:31:39.161,01:31:40.787,ALL: Yes.
01:31:40.787,01:31:43.748,"Um, am I--?"
01:31:43.748,01:31:46.209,Am I Alexander the Great?
01:31:46.209,01:31:48.378,Is it Mozart?
01:31:48.378,01:31:51.256,DE POLIGNAC: You saw.
01:31:51.256,01:31:53.342,RAUMONT: That's the second time I've won as well.
01:31:53.342,01:31:55.969,DE POLIGNAC: There's something in the oysters.
01:32:06.480,01:32:08.148,"D'ARTOIS: Be careful, please."
01:32:39.054,01:32:42.640,But you should try to visit America.
01:32:42.640,01:32:45.601,"It's beautiful, very different than France."
01:32:45.601,01:32:48.522,Our queen seems rather fond of looking at Count Fersen.
01:32:48.522,01:32:51.191,Then you've not heard of the Hasselhoff family singers?
01:32:51.191,01:32:52.401,No.
01:32:52.401,01:32:55.362,"Well, he's easy on the eyes."
01:32:56.779,01:32:58.990,But don't you think she favors him too clearly?
01:32:58.990,01:33:01.117,DE POLIGNAC: Just because it is not you?
01:33:01.117,01:33:05.788,"Don't you think it would be unbecoming to our queen, when he has quite a reputation?"
01:33:05.788,01:33:09.042,"DE POLIGNAC: He amuses her, and she likes to be amused."
01:33:09.042,01:33:13.380,"There's nothing unregal in that, monsieur."
01:33:13.380,01:33:16.091,Merci.
01:33:17.426,01:33:19.302,You must meet soldiers all the time.
01:33:19.302,01:33:21.679,"No, I don't."
01:34:33.418,01:34:36.004,And then he took it out.
01:34:36.004,01:34:37.797,Just like that.
01:34:37.797,01:34:40.550,"And I said, What do you think you'll do with that, monsieur?"
01:34:40.550,01:34:42.969,"D'ARTOIS: Oh, good God, don't act all innocent."
01:34:42.969,01:34:44.929,DE POLIGNAC: Please.
01:34:44.929,01:34:47.932,I could have told him exactly what to do with it.
01:34:47.932,01:34:49.601,"And what is that, darling?"
01:34:49.601,01:34:51.894,Put it back in his trousers where it belonged.
01:34:51.894,01:34:55.398,"DE POLIGNAC: Lamballe, ladies and gentlemen, is what we call a prude."
01:34:55.398,01:34:57.108,LAMBALLE: Better than a whore.
01:34:59.319,01:35:01.779,I wish I could go with you.
01:35:02.864,01:35:04.574,I should kidnap you.
01:36:31.620,01:36:35.540,"DE PROVENCE: Of course, you know the one about the English letter."
01:36:38.460,01:36:41.588,"Don't you want to go to Paris, see the opera?"
01:36:41.588,01:36:42.880,Your go.
01:36:42.880,01:36:45.799,I'm more comfortable just to stay here.
01:36:45.799,01:36:47.636,We have everything we need.
01:36:47.636,01:36:50.972,CASTELLANE: I should talk to the priest.
01:36:50.972,01:36:54.016,DE POLIGNAC: It is. It's dangerous for her safety.
01:36:54.016,01:36:56.102,"Goodness, a criminal could come in here."
01:36:56.102,01:36:59.063,Cheat.
01:36:59.063,01:37:02.816,"You know, I heard she's not even really a duchess."
01:37:02.816,01:37:04.277,No?
01:37:04.277,01:37:06.362,"Her husband's a thief, and he bought her title."
01:37:06.362,01:37:09.365,DE POLIGNAC: Is that what happened? Really?
01:37:09.365,01:37:11.326,DE LA LONDE: That's what I heard.
01:37:12.952,01:37:14.579,DE POLIGNAC: How much did that cost?
01:37:14.579,01:37:16.372,DE LA LONDE: A fortune.
01:37:16.372,01:37:18.500,"DE POLIGNAC: It would cost a fortune, wouldn't it?"
01:37:18.500,01:37:21.919,DE LA LONDE: To buy a title? Yes.
01:37:24.798,01:37:26.508,DE LA LONDE: She shouldn't be allowed.
01:37:26.508,01:37:28.510,"She should buy a new dress, is what she should buy."
01:37:28.510,01:37:30.970,"DE POLIGNAC: She should buy a dress, you're right."
01:37:57.038,01:38:00.709,DE POLIGNAC: Mm. Vaguely.
01:38:00.709,01:38:02.377,DE POLIGNAC: What are you laughing at?
01:38:02.377,01:38:03.628,DE LA LONDE: Nothing.
01:38:03.628,01:38:06.214,May I be excused?
01:38:06.214,01:38:08.174,"Yes, of course, madame."
01:38:08.174,01:38:11.219,DE POLIGNAC: I might go and ask her.
01:38:11.219,01:38:12.886,DE LA LONDE: Ask her about her family.
01:39:01.102,01:39:03.855,"MAN 1: The problem of the debt is grave, Your Majesty."
01:39:03.855,01:39:05.690,The people of France are hungry.
01:39:05.690,01:39:09.819,MAN 2: Sending troops to America is costing more than what we estimated.
01:39:09.819,01:39:12.906,But we can't let England win.
01:39:12.906,01:39:15.700,We must show our strength.
01:39:18.870,01:39:21.456,We will continue aid to the Americans.
01:39:24.667,01:39:31.674,"MAN: And when they went to the queen to tell her her subjects had no bread, do you know what she said?"
01:39:31.674,01:39:34.051,Let them eat cake.
01:39:34.051,01:39:37.346,That's such nonsense.
01:39:37.346,01:39:41.559,And here you're having an orgy with quite a big group.
01:39:41.559,01:39:43.394,DE POLIGNAC: I'm here sucking your toes.
01:39:43.394,01:39:45.814,Don't they ever get tired of these ridiculous stories?
01:39:45.814,01:39:50.819,"Oh, and they say you gave Thomas Jefferson a special tour of your gardens."
01:39:50.819,01:39:55.281,Is Jefferson admiring the royal bush?
01:39:56.866,01:39:57.909,"Oh, that's awful."
01:39:57.909,01:40:00.536,Can't you do something?
01:40:00.536,01:40:02.497,I'm not going to acknowledge it.
01:40:04.248,01:40:10.212,"MERCY: The French can be fickle, and, uh, Her Majesty would do well to be more attentive."
01:40:11.631,01:40:14.509,Life is getting harder for the people of France.
01:40:14.509,01:40:17.052,The bread shortage is grave.
01:40:17.052,01:40:20.556,"Well, there must be something the king can do to ease their sufferings."
01:40:20.556,01:40:24.769,Tell the court jeweler to stop sending diamonds.
01:40:24.769,01:40:27.229,"You don't need any diamonds, do you?"
01:40:27.229,01:40:28.523,No.
01:40:28.523,01:40:30.316,How pretty Madame Royale is.
01:40:30.316,01:40:32.652,I'm pleased you find me so.
01:40:33.820,01:40:35.697,Say thank you.
01:40:36.990,01:40:39.868,She is certainly a daughter of France.
01:40:39.868,01:40:41.661,"Oh, I know."
01:40:44.037,01:40:45.874,What's the matter?
01:40:45.874,01:40:47.917,Your mother has died.
01:40:47.917,01:40:49.878,I'm so sorry.
01:41:03.808,01:41:09.522,"MARIE: Oh, my brother, I am devastated by the news of our mother's death."
01:41:09.522,01:41:16.946,"You alone are left to me in Austria, which is and will always be so dear to me."
01:41:16.946,01:41:21.534,"Remember, we are your friends, your allies."
01:41:21.534,01:41:23.369,I embrace you.
01:41:37.675,01:41:39.092,Madame.
01:41:39.092,01:41:43.056,You have fulfilled our wishes and those of France.
01:41:43.056,01:41:44.807,You are the mother of a dauphin.
01:41:48.770,01:41:50.396,May I present...
01:41:50.396,01:41:53.066,...the dauphin of France.
01:42:04.285,01:42:06.161,Un dauphin!
01:42:07.663,01:42:08.873,Un dauphin!
01:42:08.873,01:42:10.666,What a joy.
01:46:35.973,01:46:37.266,Hello.
01:46:37.266,01:46:39.434,Why don't you hit the ball over there?
01:46:39.434,01:46:40.353,Come on.
01:46:40.353,01:46:41.896,You're gonna hit it.
01:46:48.819,01:46:50.821,Your Majesty.
01:46:50.821,01:46:54.407,The Bastille fortress was stormed by an angry mob.
01:46:59.538,01:47:08.839,"In view of the hatred felt for the Duchesse de Polignac, thought to be the queen's favorite, I would recommend that she leave for the Swiss border."
01:47:08.839,01:47:14.845,I also must urge all the princes and princesses of the blood to leave at once.
01:47:14.845,01:47:16.389,"Yes, they must go."
01:47:16.389,01:47:18.015,I will stay.
01:47:18.015,01:47:21.352,Certainly the royal family must find somewhere more secure.
01:47:21.352,01:47:24.646,Mm-hm. Metz is one of the strongest fortresses in Europe.
01:47:24.646,01:47:26.315,You will not be safe here.
01:47:26.315,01:47:32.071,"I will see to it that my mistresses are off at once, but my place is here with my husband."
01:48:02.435,01:48:03.894,Goodbye.
01:49:33.608,01:49:36.695,"Your Majesty, your immediate return is requested."
01:49:36.695,01:49:41.950,"There's a mob of hundreds on their way, in demand of flour from their sovereign."
01:49:46.414,01:49:50.459,"It would be more secure to decamp to Rambouillet, twice the distance from Paris."
01:49:50.459,01:49:51.793,I will not be a fugitive king.
01:49:51.793,01:49:53.379,It is too dangerous here.
01:49:53.379,01:49:55.839,CHIEF VALET: At least send the queen and children.
01:49:55.839,01:49:57.174,My place is at the king's side.
01:49:58.467,01:50:00.344,The first of them have arrived in town.
01:50:00.344,01:50:01.970,We will stay here.
01:50:25.578,01:50:26.745,"Save the queen, madame."
01:50:26.745,01:50:28.330,They're coming to kill her.
01:50:28.330,01:50:29.540,"Oh, no."
01:50:37.839,01:50:39.091,Celine.
01:50:39.091,01:50:40.926,Don't be frightened.
01:50:40.926,01:50:42.635,Let's get the children.
01:50:55.899,01:50:57.359,Oh!
01:54:57.599,01:55:00.519,Are you admiring your lime avenue?
01:55:03.772,01:55:05.733,I'm saying goodbye.
