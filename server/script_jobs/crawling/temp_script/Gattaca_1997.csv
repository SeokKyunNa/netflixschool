00:04:18.633,00:04:21.178,Welcome to Gattaca.
00:05:20.654,00:05:24.449,"You keep your workstation so clean, Jerome."
00:05:24.491,00:05:27.494,It's next to godliness.
00:05:27.535,00:05:28.495,Isn't that what they say?
00:05:28.536,00:05:30.747,Godliness.
00:05:30.789,00:05:32.582,I reviewed your flight plan.
00:05:32.624,00:05:36.003,Not one error in a million keystrokes.
00:05:36.044,00:05:37.254,Phenomenal.
00:05:37.296,00:05:41.300,It's right that someone like you is taking us to Titan.
00:05:41.340,00:05:44.552,Has the committee approved the mission?
00:05:44.594,00:05:46.345,There's been talk of delay.
00:05:46.387,00:05:48.515,You shouldn't listen to talk.
00:05:48.556,00:05:51.392,You leave in a week.
00:05:51.434,00:05:54.146,You've got a substance test.
00:06:23.800,00:06:30.515,"If you have been notified of a substance analysis, please report to the testing center."
00:06:37.522,00:06:40.108,Hm. Jerome. Never shy.
00:06:40.150,00:06:41.902,Pisses on command.
00:06:41.943,00:06:44.487,You have a beautiful piece of equipment there.
00:06:44.529,00:06:45.572,Have I ever told you that?
00:06:45.613,00:06:47.157,Only every time I'm in here.
00:06:48.158,00:06:49.951,Occupational hazard.
00:06:49.993,00:06:52.662,I see a great many in the course of any given day.
00:06:52.704,00:06:55.290,Yours just happens to be an exceptional example.
00:06:57.000,00:06:59.836,Don't know why my folks didn't order one like that for me.
00:07:15.518,00:07:19.564,"By the way, have I ever told you about my son?"
00:07:19.606,00:07:20.648,"No, you haven't."
00:07:20.690,00:07:22.650,Remind me to sometime.
00:07:24.694,00:07:27.488,So you're about to go up.
00:07:27.530,00:07:29.657,One week left.
00:07:29.699,00:07:32.369,Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
00:07:35.330,00:07:37.249,I'll tell you at the end of the week.
00:07:49.761,00:07:51.805,"Congratulations, Jerome."
00:07:54.724,00:07:56.268,Thank you.
00:07:58.895,00:08:01.189,IRENE: How many launches are there in a day?
00:08:01.231,00:08:02.523,A dozen?
00:08:04.651,00:08:06.153,Sometimes more.
00:08:07.904,00:08:10.198,You're the only one who watches every one of them.
00:08:14.244,00:08:19.207,"If you're going to pretend like you don't care, don't look up."
00:08:21.042,00:08:23.962,NARRATOR: The most unremarkable of events.
00:08:24.004,00:08:33.888,"Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1st Class, is about to embark on a one-year manned mission to Titan, the 14th moon of Saturn."
00:08:33.930,00:08:35.474,A highly prestigious assignment.
00:08:35.515,00:08:40.312,"Although, for Jerome, selection was virtually guaranteed at birth."
00:08:40.354,00:08:44.941,He's blessed with all the gifts required for such an undertaking.
00:08:44.983,00:08:48.611,A genetic quotient second to none.
00:08:48.653,00:08:54.159,"No, there is truly nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow."
00:08:54.201,00:08:57.496,Except that I am not Jerome Morrow.
00:09:06.671,00:09:09.632,I was conceived in the Riviera.
00:09:09.674,00:09:11.592,Not the French Riviera.
00:09:11.634,00:09:13.761,The Detroit variety.
00:09:15.430,00:09:19.893,They used to say that a child conceived in love has a greater chance of happiness.
00:09:21.061,00:09:23.230,They don't say that anymore.
00:09:25.940,00:09:31.738,I'll never understand what possessed my mother to put her faith in God's hands rather than those of her local geneticist.
00:09:35.616,00:09:38.619,"Ten fingers, 10 toes, that's all that used to matter."
00:09:38.661,00:09:40.497,Not now.
00:09:40.539,00:09:46.753,"Now only seconds old, the exact time and cause of my death was already known."
00:09:51.425,00:09:54.635,"Neurological condition, 60 percent probability."
00:09:54.677,00:09:57.347,"Manic depression, 42 percent probability."
00:09:57.389,00:10:01.393,"Attention deficit disorder, 89 percent probability."
00:10:01.435,00:10:02.727,Heart disorder...
00:10:04.854,00:10:06.689,99 percent probability.
00:10:06.731,00:10:08.775,Early fatal potential.
00:10:08.816,00:10:12.320,Life expectancy: 30.2 years.
00:10:13.363,00:10:14.989,Thirty years?
00:10:15.031,00:10:17.200,The name for the certificate?
00:10:17.242,00:10:18.535,Anton.
00:10:18.577,00:10:21.829,"No. Um, Vincent Anton."
00:10:23.873,00:10:27.294,Yeah. That's a good name.
00:10:30.046,00:10:32.673,I know he'll do something.
00:10:32.715,00:10:34.259,You'll do something.
00:10:37.137,00:10:38.597,MARIE: Vincent?
00:10:38.638,00:10:43.017,From an early age I came to think of myself as others thought of me.
00:10:43.059,00:10:44.561,Chronically ill.
00:10:44.603,00:10:48.689,Every skinned knee and runny nose was treated as if it were life-threatening.
00:10:48.731,00:10:51.151,I'm sorry.
00:10:51.192,00:10:56.239,If he fell-- But I was told everything-- I really wish there was something I could do.
00:11:05.415,00:11:14.424,"Like most other parents of their day, they were determined that their next child would be brought into the world in what has become the natural way."
00:11:14.466,00:11:24.142,"MAN: Your extracted eggs, uh, Marie, have been fertilized with Antonio's sperm."
00:11:24.184,00:11:29.439,"After screening, we are left, as you see, with two healthy boys and two very healthy girls."
00:11:29.481,00:11:34.402,"Naturally, no critical predispositions to any of the major inheritable diseases."
00:11:34.444,00:11:37.280,All that remains is to select the most compatible candidate.
00:11:38.490,00:11:40.783,First we may as well decide on gender.
00:11:40.825,00:11:42.202,Have you given it any thought?
00:11:42.243,00:11:47.081,"Uh, we would want Vincent to have a brother, you know, um, to play with."
00:11:47.123,00:11:48.833,Of course you would.
00:11:49.792,00:11:51.628,Hi.
00:11:51.670,00:11:56.383,"Now, you have specified hazel eyes, dark hair and, uh, fair skin."
00:11:57.592,00:12:07.768,"I've taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions: uh, premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, uh, propensity for violence, obesity, et cetera."
00:12:07.810,00:12:10.771,"We didn't want-- Uh, I mean, diseases, yes."
00:12:10.813,00:12:11.898,"But, uh..."
00:12:11.939,00:12:16.152,"Right, we were just wondering if-- If it's good to just leave a few things to-- To chance."
00:12:16.194,00:12:19.738,You want to give your child the best possible start.
00:12:19.780,00:12:22.158,"Believe me, we have enough imperfection built in already."
00:12:22.200,00:12:24.952,Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.
00:12:26.162,00:12:28.747,"And keep in mind, this child is still you."
00:12:28.789,00:12:31.918,Simply the best of you.
00:12:31.959,00:12:35.754,You could conceive naturally 1000 times and never get such a result.
00:12:38.341,00:12:41.344,"That's how my brother, Anton, came into the world."
00:12:41.386,00:12:45.181,A son my father considered worthy of his name.
00:12:57.026,00:12:58.737,"I'm proud of you, son."
00:12:58.777,00:13:00.154,What did I tell you?
00:13:00.196,00:13:01.822,See how much he's grown.
00:13:16.421,00:13:23.136,"By the time we were playing at blood brothers, I understood there was something very different flowing through my veins."
00:13:23.177,00:13:27.766,And I'd need an awful lot more than a drop if I was going to get anywhere.
00:13:49.203,00:13:51.331,Our favorite game was chicken.
00:13:51.372,00:13:55.669,"When our parents weren't watching, we used to swim as far out as we dared."
00:13:55.710,00:13:58.921,It was about who would get scared and turn back first.
00:14:13.936,00:14:15.772,"Come on, you coward!"
00:14:17.940,00:14:20.819,Of course it was always me.
00:14:20.860,00:14:25.782,"Anton was by far the stronger swimmer, and he had no excuse to fail."
00:14:29.703,00:14:34.499,"VINCENT: Three hundred million, 350 million, 400 million..."
00:14:34.541,00:14:37.168,Maybe it was the love of the planets.
00:14:37.210,00:14:40.046,Maybe it was just my growing dislike for this one.
00:14:40.087,00:14:43.842,"But for as long as I can remember, I have dreamed of going into space."
00:14:43.883,00:14:51.307,"...700 million, 750 million, 800 million, 850 million."
00:14:51.349,00:14:54.018,ANTON: How many astronauts are there anyway?
00:14:55.186,00:14:57.188,"I bet I could be one, if I wanted."
00:14:57.230,00:14:58.189,"Hey, don't eat that."
00:14:58.231,00:15:00.608,It's Pluto.
00:15:03.820,00:15:06.865,My goals didn't change a lot in the intervening years.
00:15:06.906,00:15:07.990,Vincent.
00:15:08.032,00:15:10.243,Much to my parents' dismay.
00:15:11.160,00:15:12.662,Vincent.
00:15:18.418,00:15:20.294,You have to be realistic.
00:15:20.336,00:15:23.047,With a heart condition like yours...
00:15:23.089,00:15:27.301,"Mom, there's a chance there's nothing even wrong with my heart."
00:15:27.343,00:15:29.929,One chance in 100.
00:15:29.970,00:15:31.305,"Well, I'll take it, all right?"
00:15:31.347,00:15:34.100,MARIE: The trouble is they won't.
00:15:34.141,00:15:38.438,"ANTONIO: Listen, for God's sake, you got to understand something."
00:15:43.943,00:15:48.114,The only way that you'll see the inside of a spaceship is if you were cleaning it.
00:15:49.031,00:15:50.617,My father was right.
00:15:50.658,00:15:53.453,It didn't matter how much I lied on my résumé.
00:15:53.494,00:15:56.372,My real résumé was in my cells.
00:15:56.414,00:16:04.338,Why should anybody invest all that money to train me when there are a thousand other applicants with a far cleaner profile?
00:16:04.380,00:16:07.049,Of course it's illegal to discriminate.
00:16:07.091,00:16:09.135,"Genoism, it's called."
00:16:09.176,00:16:12.388,But no one takes the law seriously.
00:16:19.145,00:16:25.735,"If you refuse to disclose, they can always take a sample from a door handle or a handshake."
00:16:25.777,00:16:29.697,Even the saliva on your application form.
00:16:29.739,00:16:37.914,"If in doubt, a legal drug test can just as easily become an illegal peek at your future in the company."
00:16:46.130,00:16:48.132,You sure you want to do this?
00:16:48.174,00:16:49.717,You know you're gonna lose.
00:17:00.060,00:17:02.480,It was the last time we swam together.
00:17:02.522,00:17:04.691,Out into the open sea.
00:17:04.732,00:17:10.530,"Like always, knowing each stroke to the horizon was one we'd have to make back to the shore."
00:17:24.002,00:17:27.046,But something was very different about that day.
00:17:27.087,00:17:32.176,Every time Anton tried to pull away he found me right beside him.
00:17:35.388,00:17:39.141,Until finally the impossible happened.
00:17:39.183,00:17:41.895,Vincent! Vincent!
00:17:56.576,00:18:04.083,It was the one moment in our lives that my brother was not as strong as he believed and I was not as weak.
00:18:04.124,00:18:07.294,It was the moment that made everything else possible.
00:18:50.588,00:18:57.177,"Like many others in my situation, I moved around a lot in the next few years, getting work where I could."
00:18:57.219,00:19:00.014,I must have cleaned half the toilets in the state.
00:19:01.599,00:19:07.814,"I belonged to a new underclass, no longer determined by social status or the color of your skin."
00:19:07.855,00:19:09.732,"CAESAR: Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen."
00:19:09.774,00:19:14.028,"No, we now have discrimination down to a science."
00:19:14.070,00:19:16.405,All right.
00:19:16.447,00:19:20.034,Start from the front and clean all the way back!
00:19:20.076,00:19:24.204,And I want to see my smiling face on that floor.
00:19:33.213,00:19:34.423,"What about you, Your Majesty?"
00:19:34.465,00:19:37.343,You're dreaming of space?
00:19:37.384,00:19:38.845,Come here.
00:19:43.432,00:19:46.686,You can start by cleaning this space right here.
00:19:49.313,00:19:55.444,I was never more certain of how far away I was from my goal than when I was standing right beside it.
00:21:07.683,00:21:10.394,"When you clean the glass, Vincent, don't clean it too well."
00:21:10.436,00:21:12.396,What do you mean?
00:21:12.438,00:21:14.774,You might get ideas.
00:21:14.815,00:21:19.195,"Yeah, but if the glass is clean, it'll be easier for you to see me when I'm on the other side of it."
00:21:20.196,00:21:21.530,Ha.
00:22:11.330,00:22:14.292,"For all my brave talk, I knew it was just that."
00:22:14.333,00:22:22.382,"No matter how much I trained or how much I studied, the best test score in the world wasn't gonna matter unless I had the blood test to go with it."
00:22:23.634,00:22:27.721,I made up my mind to resort to more extreme measures.
00:22:27.763,00:22:32.392,The man who showed up at my doorstep didn't exactly advertise in the Yellow Pages.
00:22:32.434,00:22:34.103,Stand straight.
00:22:36.480,00:22:38.398,How did you hear about me?
00:22:38.440,00:22:40.318,People.
00:22:40.358,00:22:41.694,Any distinguishing marks?
00:22:41.735,00:22:44.197,"Tattoos, scars, birth marks?"
00:22:44.238,00:22:47.533,No. I don't think so.
00:22:48.575,00:22:50.577,Are you serious about this?
00:22:50.619,00:22:52.163,I hope you're not wasting my time.
00:22:52.205,00:22:55.708,"No, I-- I'd-- I'd give 100 percent."
00:22:55.749,00:22:57.877,That'll get you halfway there.
00:22:59.295,00:23:04.382,"That-- That's an old edition, but I know it all by heart."
00:23:04.424,00:23:05.843,"By heart, huh?"
00:23:08.054,00:23:10.890,You realize the commitment is binding.
00:23:11.932,00:23:13.600,You have somebody in mind?
00:23:34.663,00:23:40.920,"For the genetically superior, success is easier to attain, but it is by no means guaranteed."
00:23:40.961,00:23:45.216,"After all, there is no gene for fate."
00:23:45.258,00:23:55.393,"And when, for one reason or another, a member of the elite falls on hard times, their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity for the unscrupulous."
00:23:55.433,00:23:58.104,One man's loss is another man's gain.
00:23:58.145,00:24:00.147,GERMAN: His credentials are impeccable.
00:24:00.189,00:24:02.608,An expiration date you wouldn't believe.
00:24:08.197,00:24:10.448,The guy's practically gonna live forever.
00:24:10.490,00:24:13.160,He's got an IQ off the register.
00:24:13.202,00:24:15.955,Better than 20/20 in both eyes.
00:24:15.996,00:24:17.497,And the heart of an ox.
00:24:17.539,00:24:19.917,He could run through a wall.
00:24:24.504,00:24:26.299,If he could still run.
00:24:28.634,00:24:32.554,"Actually, he was a bigtime swimming star."
00:24:32.596,00:24:38.227,"Vincent, you could go anywhere with this guy's helix tucked under your arm."
00:24:41.730,00:24:43.190,What did I tell you?
00:24:43.232,00:24:46.319,"You look so right together, I want to double my fee."
00:24:46.360,00:24:47.361,We don't look anything alike.
00:24:47.403,00:24:49.029,It's close enough.
00:24:49.071,00:24:51.449,When was the last time anybody looked at a photograph?
00:24:51.489,00:24:53.993,"You could have my face on your nametag, for chrissake."
00:24:54.034,00:24:55.786,"Well, how do I explain the accident?"
00:24:55.828,00:24:57.495,That's the beautiful thing.
00:24:57.537,00:24:59.999,It happened out of the country.
00:25:00.040,00:25:02.084,There's no record he ever broke his back.
00:25:02.126,00:25:07.047,"As far as anyone's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully productive member of society."
00:25:07.089,00:25:10.592,You just have to get him clean and fill in the last year of his life.
00:25:10.634,00:25:13.179,You're a foreigner.
00:25:13.220,00:25:16.015,"They don't care where you were born, just how."
00:25:16.056,00:25:19.018,Blood has no nationality.
00:25:19.059,00:25:23.439,"As long as it's got what they're looking for, it's the only passport you need."
00:25:24.731,00:25:26.108,Who lives up there?
00:25:27.360,00:25:29.320,"Well, I certainly don't."
00:25:31.697,00:25:35.159,So began the process of becoming Jerome.
00:25:35.201,00:25:39.705,Myopia is one of the most obvious signs of a disadvantaged birth.
00:25:39.746,00:25:41.374,Isn't there another way?
00:25:41.415,00:25:43.583,No. Surgery's no good.
00:25:43.625,00:25:44.960,You'll see the scars.
00:25:45.002,00:25:47.963,It's contact lenses or a white cane.
00:25:49.089,00:25:52.801,"Besides, the color doesn't match."
00:25:52.843,00:25:53.844,JEROME: He's right.
00:25:53.886,00:25:56.389,My eyes are prettier.
00:25:59.350,00:26:02.311,You understand I take 25 percent of everything you make.
00:26:02.353,00:26:07.525,"If for some reason, it doesn't work out, all this equipment must be returned within seven days."
00:26:07.565,00:26:09.193,And you don't get your deposit back.
00:26:09.235,00:26:11.778,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:26:11.820,00:26:13.447,You told me 20 percent.
00:26:13.489,00:26:14.448,Twenty percent.
00:26:14.490,00:26:15.824,It's not negotiable.
00:26:30.630,00:26:31.673,I guess that's it.
00:26:31.715,00:26:33.384,"Mm, not quite."
00:26:33.426,00:26:34.760,VINCENT: Why? What?
00:26:34.801,00:26:36.636,There's still a matter of the height.
00:26:36.678,00:26:38.722,Why? How tall are you?
00:26:38.764,00:26:39.973,Four-foot-six.
00:26:40.015,00:26:41.559,How tall were you before the accident?
00:26:41.599,00:26:45.521,"GERMAN: Unfortunately, his profile says he's 6'1."
00:26:47.314,00:26:48.357,So I can wear lifts.
00:26:49.733,00:26:52.528,"Even with lifts, you're not that tall."
00:26:55.072,00:26:56.407,So what?
00:27:02.788,00:27:05.916,No. No.
00:27:08.168,00:27:09.128,"No, we never discussed that."
00:27:09.169,00:27:10.379,JEROME: Oh.
00:27:10.421,00:27:12.298,"I thought you were serious, Vincent."
00:27:12.339,00:27:15.050,I am serious.
00:27:20.806,00:27:22.182,I won't do that.
00:27:28.147,00:27:30.899,Jerome never questioned my commitment again.
00:27:30.941,00:27:39.950,"I took my mind off the pain by reminding myself that when I eventually did stand up, I'd be exactly two inches closer to the stars."
00:27:39.992,00:27:42.744,You all right?
00:27:42.786,00:27:44.121,Yeah.
00:27:46.873,00:27:49.251,Do you want to go dancing?
00:27:50.836,00:27:53.339,"You had to be a right-hander, huh?"
00:27:53.380,00:27:56.300,I guess no one orders southpaws anymore.
00:27:57.593,00:27:58.885,Jerome Morrow.
00:28:00.720,00:28:02.348,It's a nice name.
00:28:04.975,00:28:06.268,It's my name.
00:28:06.310,00:28:08.686,I can't be you without it.
00:28:08.728,00:28:11.315,What makes you think you can be me at all?
00:28:20.616,00:28:22.075,Look at this.
00:28:23.869,00:28:25.412,Look at it.
00:28:26.622,00:28:28.123,It's nice.
00:28:29.625,00:28:31.377,I'm impressed.
00:28:32.461,00:28:34.754,"Are you colorblind too, Vincent?"
00:28:34.796,00:28:36.882,It's silver.
00:28:36.923,00:28:41.136,Jerome Morrow was never meant to be one step down on the podium.
00:28:42.929,00:28:47.726,"With all I had going for me, I was still second best."
00:28:49.936,00:28:51.313,Me.
00:28:53.357,00:28:55.693,So how do you expect to pull this off?
00:28:57.903,00:28:59.946,I don't know exactly.
00:29:05.202,00:29:06.786,Your signature needs work.
00:29:08.414,00:29:11.542,It soon came time to put our preparations to the test.
00:29:11.584,00:29:18.340,"Jerome had been engineered with everything he needed to get into Gattaca, except the desire to do so."
00:29:18.382,00:29:20.259,Do you really want to be in there?
00:29:20.300,00:29:22.636,I don't want to be in there.
00:29:22.678,00:29:24.179,I want to be up there.
00:29:25.931,00:29:27.224,JEROME: What's up there?
00:29:28.475,00:29:30.728,"That's what I want to find out, Jerome."
00:29:32.812,00:29:35.857,Call me Eugene.
00:29:35.899,00:29:37.359,My middle name.
00:29:38.818,00:29:42.239,"If you're gonna be Jerome, you better start getting used to it."
00:29:52.541,00:29:54.334,I got to get going.
00:29:54.376,00:29:56.795,JEROME: In the refrigerator.
00:29:58.838,00:29:59.798,Which pouch?
00:29:59.839,00:30:01.759,"Oh, any of them."
00:30:04.928,00:30:06.764,You think I should test it?
00:30:07.681,00:30:09.057,If you like.
00:30:16.064,00:30:18.442,My God! What's wrong with the machine?
00:30:18.484,00:30:20.360,There's nothing wrong with the machine.
00:30:20.402,00:30:22.195,It's a hot sample!
00:30:22.237,00:30:23.905,I haven't.
00:30:23.947,00:30:25.949,It's 8:00 in the morning.
00:30:25.991,00:30:27.534,I haven't!
00:30:34.291,00:30:37.670,This is no joke.
00:30:43.883,00:30:47.304,There is more vodka in this piss than there is piss.
00:30:47.346,00:30:49.807,"All right, I'm sorry."
00:30:49.848,00:30:51.183,I'm sorry.
00:30:51.224,00:30:54.060,Try Friday's.
00:30:54.102,00:30:55.354,There's only Wednesday left.
00:30:55.395,00:30:57.897,Wednesday.
00:31:10.035,00:31:13.372,"Listen, it's not too late to back out."
00:31:16.916,00:31:20.796,This is the last day that you're gonna be you and I'm gonna be me.
00:31:24.924,00:31:26.385,Well?
00:31:55.748,00:31:57.165,Congratulations.
00:31:58.500,00:32:01.837,Wh-- What about the interview?
00:32:01.879,00:32:03.922,That was it.
00:32:11.930,00:32:13.557,I got it.
00:32:15.308,00:32:17.143,Of course you got it.
00:32:26.945,00:32:29.114,And that's the way it was.
00:32:29.155,00:32:40.125,"Each day I would dispose of as much loose skin, fingernails and hair as possible to limit how much of my In-Valid self I would leave in the Valid world."
00:32:45.798,00:32:52.471,"At the same time, Eugene prepared samples of his own superior body matter so that I might pass for him."
00:32:52.512,00:32:55.974,Customized urine pouches for the frequent substance tests.
00:32:56.015,00:32:59.853,Fingertip blood sachets for security checks.
00:32:59.895,00:33:03.022,And vials filled with other traces.
00:33:04.023,00:33:11.782,"While Eugene supplied me with a new identity, I paid the rent and kept him in the style to which he'd become accustomed."
00:33:11.824,00:33:18.455,"Eugene never suffered from the routine discrimination of a utero, a faith birth, or In-Valid, as we were called."
00:33:18.497,00:33:25.879,"A Valid, a vitro, a made man, he suffered under a different burden: the burden of perfection."
00:33:27.714,00:33:33.512,I was now a member of a relatively new and particularly detested segment of society.
00:33:33.553,00:33:37.349,One of those who refuses to play the hand that he was dealt.
00:33:37.390,00:33:40.936,I am most commonly known as a borrowed ladder.
00:33:40.978,00:33:44.147,Or a de-gene-erate.
00:33:50.236,00:33:54.783,"In the guise of Jerome Morrow, I have risen quickly through the ranks of Gattaca."
00:33:54.825,00:34:00.372,Only one of the mission directors has ever come close to discovering my true identity.
00:34:00.413,00:34:07.086,"Strange to think, he may have more success exposing me in death than he ever did in life."
00:34:14.011,00:34:16.638,Level temporarily closed.
00:34:16.680,00:34:18.974,Please evacuate immediately.
00:34:19.016,00:34:21.643,We apologize for any inconvenience.
00:34:29.108,00:34:31.277,"MAN: Well, I think we can rule out suicide."
00:34:31.319,00:34:32.738,"MAN 2: Excuse me, sir?"
00:34:32.779,00:34:34.155,Nothing.
00:34:35.240,00:34:36.700,Thank you.
00:34:39.369,00:34:41.204,This is going to take a while.
00:34:41.246,00:34:43.540,We may have to push things back.
00:34:56.970,00:35:01.725,"Irene, I want you to assist the investigators."
00:35:01.767,00:35:03.894,"My work, director."
00:35:03.936,00:35:07.480,"Uh, I appreciate your sacrifice, Irene."
00:35:07.522,00:35:10.191,Will you see to it I don't lose my place in line?
00:35:10.233,00:35:12.527,Your place is assured.
00:35:12.569,00:35:21.453,So will you kindly inform the authorities that we will cooperate in any way although we can't tolerate a major disruption.
00:35:21.494,00:35:24.247,"Director-- Thank you, Irene."
00:35:24.289,00:35:25.958,"Thank you, director."
00:35:27.876,00:35:31.630,"Director, how will this affect the mission?"
00:35:31.671,00:35:34.967,"Oh, we're still going ahead as planned."
00:35:35.008,00:35:45.936,"The launch window is only open until week's end, and tragic though this event may be, it hasn't stopped the planets turning, has it?"
00:35:56.905,00:35:58.115,What happened?
00:35:58.156,00:35:59.616,I'm going up.
00:35:59.658,00:36:01.242,When?
00:36:02.410,00:36:04.203,End of the week.
00:36:04.245,00:36:07.707,End of the week? That soon?
00:36:07.749,00:36:10.085,What about the mission director?
00:36:12.337,00:36:14.047,He's dead.
00:36:16.008,00:36:17.175,Are you serious?
00:36:18.718,00:36:23.473,They found him in his office this morning beaten so badly they had to check his nametag.
00:36:25.142,00:36:27.644,You are serious.
00:36:27.686,00:36:28.979,So that's it.
00:36:29.021,00:36:32.774,There's nothing between us and ignition.
00:36:35.193,00:36:37.154,I'm going up.
00:36:38.113,00:36:39.489,The man was murdered?
00:36:39.531,00:36:41.491,So? I didn't do it.
00:36:41.533,00:36:44.536,"But if the man was murdered, the place will be crawling with Hoovers."
00:36:44.577,00:36:47.873,I'll take my chances with the J. Edgars over the mission director.
00:36:47.914,00:36:50.208,"Besides, what if they do find something?"
00:36:50.249,00:36:53.045,I'm gonna be slightly out of their jurisdiction.
00:36:58.633,00:37:01.219,We have to get drunk immediately.
00:37:08.434,00:37:09.769,"Good evening, gentlemen."
00:37:09.811,00:37:11.188,I heard my table's ready?
00:37:11.229,00:37:13.314,"I understand you're leaving us, Mr. Morrow."
00:37:13.356,00:37:14.357,Yeah. Looks that way.
00:37:14.399,00:37:15.692,We're going to miss you.
00:37:15.734,00:37:17.318,"You've opened the wine, I hope?"
00:37:17.360,00:37:18.862,"Of course, sir."
00:37:18.904,00:37:20.321,"Pour yourself a glass, Cavendish."
00:37:20.363,00:37:22.032,"Thank you, sir."
00:37:45.388,00:37:46.305,How old?
00:37:46.347,00:37:47.473,Me?
00:37:47.515,00:37:48.683,This specimen.
00:37:48.725,00:37:50.268,I kissed him five minutes ago.
00:37:50.309,00:37:52.604,A real good one.
00:37:52.645,00:37:54.647,MAN: I'll see what I can do.
00:37:58.568,00:38:00.445,WOMAN: You want the full sequence?
00:38:00.486,00:38:03.322,IRENE: Yes. Thank you.
00:38:04.241,00:38:06.076,MAN: Good luck.
00:38:10.288,00:38:15.252,"Sequencing, in any way, is not responsible for any loss or damage."
00:38:15.293,00:38:20.048,Some samples may be consumed in the sequencing process.
00:38:20.090,00:38:23.384,Take advantage of our sequencing special...
00:38:23.426,00:38:26.387,WOMAN: Nine-point-three.
00:38:27.722,00:38:31.017,Yes. Quite a catch.
00:38:57.002,00:39:00.297,"God, how many times have I told Cavendish?"
00:39:00.338,00:39:03.549,Oh-- This can't have been opened more than five minutes ago!
00:39:03.591,00:39:05.093,A wine like this needs to breathe.
00:39:05.135,00:39:06.427,Remember that.
00:39:06.469,00:39:13.059,"You know, they say when you're weightless, it's the closest thing to being in the womb."
00:39:16.562,00:39:19.398,I can't believe you pulled this off.
00:39:19.440,00:39:21.818,They're sending you up there.
00:39:21.860,00:39:23.195,"Up there, for chrissake."
00:39:23.236,00:39:24.696,"You, of all people."
00:39:24.737,00:39:26.865,I hate to think of you alone in that room for a year.
00:39:26.906,00:39:29.742,Don't think about it.
00:39:29.784,00:39:32.120,The room I'm stuck in is bigger than your tin can.
00:39:32.162,00:39:34.372,You know what I'm saying.
00:39:35.623,00:39:38.084,I have my books.
00:39:39.460,00:39:40.920,I'd be happier if you had some company.
00:39:40.962,00:39:42.088,I have visitors.
00:39:42.130,00:39:44.382,"Yeah, well, none that you don't pay."
00:39:44.423,00:39:45.925,I wouldn't have it any other way.
00:39:45.967,00:39:49.846,"Seriously, what are you gonna do?"
00:39:51.723,00:39:53.599,I'm gonna finish this.
00:40:06.988,00:40:08.990,What's Titan like this time of year?
00:40:12.285,00:40:13.828,What's Titan like?
00:40:13.870,00:40:35.267,"Titan is exactly like this: All the time, it's got a cloud around it so thick nobody can tell what's underneath."
00:40:36.434,00:40:37.852,Maybe there's nothing there.
00:40:37.894,00:40:40.479,There's something there.
00:40:45.860,00:40:48.071,You should be going instead of me.
00:40:50.156,00:40:51.241,Why is that?
00:40:52.575,00:40:55.245,'Cause up there your legs wouldn't matter.
00:41:02.168,00:41:04.003,I'm scared of heights.
00:41:24.441,00:41:26.192,I'm sorry.
00:41:27.485,00:41:29.362,Do you want this?
00:41:29.404,00:41:31.864,"I'll save some for you, shall I?"
00:41:40.415,00:41:42.375,I'm so sorry.
00:41:42.417,00:41:43.793,"No, you're not that sorry."
00:41:43.835,00:41:45.586,"I'm really, really sorry."
00:41:49.757,00:41:51.926,Don't give me a hard time.
00:41:55.513,00:41:57.598,Come on! Come on!
00:41:57.640,00:42:01.186,Help! Help!
00:42:09.694,00:42:11.029,"You know, I wasn't drunk."
00:42:11.070,00:42:13.031,"What do you mean, you're not drunk?"
00:42:13.072,00:42:15.325,When I walked in front of that car.
00:42:15.367,00:42:17.702,What car?
00:42:17.743,00:42:20.997,I stepped right out in front of it.
00:42:21.039,00:42:23.582,I'd never been more sober in my life.
00:42:26.294,00:42:27.586,Go to sleep.
00:42:27.628,00:42:29.381,"I couldn't even get that right, could I?"
00:42:30.631,00:42:34.677,"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."
00:42:34.719,00:42:36.346,Go to sleep.
00:42:42.018,00:42:44.354,"I'm proud of you, Vincent."
00:42:48.274,00:42:51.903,You must be drunk to call me Vincent.
00:43:31.568,00:43:32.569,How much do you need?
00:43:32.610,00:43:34.028,Twenty minutes.
00:43:55.800,00:43:57.176,You can go.
00:44:03.766,00:44:06.060,"It's all right, Irene."
00:44:30.376,00:44:31.836,We found our man.
00:44:31.877,00:44:35.381,It's the only specimen in the entire place that can't be accounted for.
00:44:35.423,00:44:37.550,"Every 10 years or so, things go our way."
00:44:37.592,00:44:40.011,The eyelash.
00:44:40.052,00:44:42.347,It's an unregistered In-Valid.
00:44:42.388,00:44:45.766,"He was a janitor here until a few years back, when he disappeared out of sight."
00:44:45.808,00:44:47.852,So the specimen could have been here since then.
00:44:47.893,00:44:49.604,"Well, take a look at the floor, sir."
00:44:49.646,00:44:51.730,I don't think anything lays around here for very long.
00:44:51.772,00:44:53.441,There's also the matter of motive.
00:44:53.483,00:44:56.944,Is the janitor gonna come back after all this time to kill a man he never knew?
00:44:56.986,00:44:59.447,"Well, his profile does suggest a violent temperament."
00:44:59.489,00:45:03.493,"If I'm not mistaken, his profile also suggests he's a sick man."
00:45:03.535,00:45:07.955,There's a 90 percent chance the owner of this eyelash has already died himself of natural causes.
00:45:07.997,00:45:09.790,That means there's a 10 percent chance he's still alive.
00:45:09.832,00:45:11.626,"It's a lost-and-found case, sir."
00:45:11.668,00:45:16.422,"All we have to do is find the man who's minus an eyelash, we have the murderer."
00:45:16.464,00:45:18.883,I'll find out about his family-- I've already run it.
00:45:18.924,00:45:21.219,There's no record of any living relative.
00:45:21.260,00:45:22.761,"Well, that's a damn shame, sir."
00:45:22.803,00:45:25.431,I want you to check the entry log.
00:45:25.473,00:45:26.807,"Alibis, grudges."
00:45:26.849,00:45:29.018,I look around.
00:45:29.060,00:45:32.813,"The mission director was not, uh, universally loved."
00:45:32.855,00:45:35.816,He was leading cutbacks in the program.
00:45:37.776,00:45:39.111,"With all due respect, sir..."
00:45:42.865,00:45:44.450,Whatever you say.
00:46:00.883,00:46:03.802,"Jerome, Jerome the metronome."
00:46:03.844,00:46:05.971,I could play the piano by that heartbeat of his.
00:46:07.806,00:46:11.603,"DETECTIVE: Mr. Director, you will be pleased to know that we have a suspect."
00:46:11.644,00:46:14.105,That is a relief.
00:46:14.146,00:46:18.901,"We found an unaccounted-for specimen in the South Wing, and here's his picture."
00:46:19.944,00:46:21.529,DIRECTOR: An In-Valid.
00:46:21.571,00:46:24.031,DETECTIVE 2: We are still following other leads.
00:46:24.073,00:46:27.702,"Be that as it may, I'm having this posted immediately."
00:46:27.744,00:46:29.621,"I'm curious, director."
00:46:29.662,00:46:34.751,"An advantage, I should imagine, in your line of work."
00:46:34.791,00:46:37.336,"DETECTIVE 2: Your, uh, hiring practices."
00:46:37.378,00:46:39.880,DIRECTOR: Our recruitment philosophy.
00:46:39.922,00:46:42.133,Who do you have to be to be here?
00:46:42.174,00:46:46.721,"Well, naturally, our standard is beyond that of the common citizen."
00:46:46.763,00:46:50.057,Even amongst your people you must have varying levels of excellence.
00:46:50.099,00:46:54.646,Occasionally we've been forced to accept candidates with minor shortcomings.
00:46:54.687,00:47:01.694,"But nothing that would prohibit someone from working in a field such as law enforcement, for example."
00:47:01.736,00:47:08.785,But now there are enough of the right kind of people to warrant a new measuring stick.
00:47:08.825,00:47:10.620,Bodies with minds to match.
00:47:10.662,00:47:15.832,Essential as we push out further and further.
00:47:15.874,00:47:17.918,Yet you still closely monitor performance.
00:47:17.960,00:47:21.339,DIRECTOR: We have to ensure that people are meeting their potential.
00:47:21.380,00:47:24.342,And exceeding it?
00:47:24.383,00:47:25.468,If he did?
00:47:25.510,00:47:29.430,DIRECTOR: It means that we did not accurately gauge his potential in the first place.
00:47:42.777,00:47:43.820,"Are you all right, Jerome?"
00:47:43.860,00:47:45.988,Terrific.
00:48:10.388,00:48:13.098,IRENE: This is the entry log for the last seven days.
00:48:16.018,00:48:17.311,"What about you, Irene?"
00:48:18.270,00:48:19.731,Do you have an alibi?
00:48:20.897,00:48:22.191,I was alone.
00:48:22.233,00:48:23.900,I find that hard to believe.
00:48:23.942,00:48:26.362,Excuse me.
00:48:35.580,00:48:38.332,"I'll take care of that for you, Mr. Morrow."
00:48:51.846,00:48:55.683,I see I'm not the only one who looks up every time there's a launch.
00:48:55.725,00:48:56.809,"Hello, Jerome."
00:48:56.851,00:48:58.269,Hello.
00:49:00.855,00:49:02.857,It's awful about the director.
00:49:02.899,00:49:04.609,Awful it didn't happen sooner.
00:49:06.360,00:49:10.114,"Didn't the director threaten to cancel your mission more than once, Jerome?"
00:49:10.155,00:49:11.282,"Yes, he did."
00:49:11.323,00:49:13.451,Somebody did you a favor.
00:49:13.492,00:49:15.828,Do they have any idea whose hand I should be shaking?
00:49:15.870,00:49:18.289,They found an eyelash in the South Wing.
00:49:18.330,00:49:19.248,Does it have a name?
00:49:19.290,00:49:20.917,Just some In-Valid.
00:49:23.544,00:49:24.961,Jerome...
00:49:28.299,00:49:29.966,I had you sequenced.
00:49:30.008,00:49:32.052,I read your profile.
00:49:33.053,00:49:35.013,I'm sorry.
00:49:38.225,00:49:41.061,Seems you're everything they say you are and more.
00:49:43.063,00:49:45.650,"What about you, Irene?"
00:49:45.691,00:49:47.610,You're engineered just like the rest of us.
00:49:47.652,00:49:49.904,Not quite like the rest of you.
00:49:51.196,00:49:53.908,Unacceptable likelihood of heart failure.
00:49:53.950,00:49:56.160,I think that's what the manual says.
00:49:56.201,00:50:01.081,The only trip I'll take in space is around the sun on this satellite right here.
00:50:02.333,00:50:06.295,"Well, if there's anything wrong with you, I can't see it from where I'm standing."
00:50:10.466,00:50:12.176,If you don't believe me...
00:50:15.137,00:50:18.683,Here. Take it.
00:50:26.983,00:50:29.485,"If you're still interested, let me know."
00:50:33.948,00:50:36.158,I'm sorry.
00:50:57.179,00:51:01.684,Please check the latest Gattaca bulletin.
00:51:11.151,00:51:12.570,DIRECTOR: Jerome.
00:51:12.611,00:51:18.617,Is this the approach path that we discussed?
00:51:20.118,00:51:21.996,"Absolutely, director."
00:51:23.121,00:51:27.043,Quite right. Quite right.
00:51:40.806,00:51:46.102,"JEROME: Listen to what I'm saying to you, I want what I ordered."
00:51:46.144,00:51:48.522,It's a completely different color.
00:51:48.564,00:51:50.983,No. I'm bored of talking to you.
00:51:51.025,00:51:53.360,I'm bored.
00:51:55.362,00:51:57.907,That was the company that sell us your hair dye.
00:51:57.949,00:52:01.117,They've sent me Summer Wheat instead of Honey Dawn.
00:52:01.159,00:52:03.370,Any fool knows it's two shades lighter.
00:52:03.412,00:52:04.997,"She said, Why don't you try a change?"
00:52:05.039,00:52:07.708,I don't want a change We can't use a change.
00:52:08.793,00:52:12.004,Now I'm probably gonna have to pay for the five boxes they've sent me.
00:52:12.046,00:52:13.672,We can't stay here.
00:52:13.714,00:52:16.132,The idiots I have to deal with you wouldn't believe.
00:52:16.174,00:52:18.719,VINCENT: They think I killed the mission director.
00:52:20.429,00:52:22.098,What makes them think that?
00:52:23.099,00:52:25.517,They found my eyelash.
00:52:27.227,00:52:28.228,Where?
00:52:28.270,00:52:30.146,In the corridor.
00:52:30.188,00:52:31.398,"Oh, well, it could be worse."
00:52:31.440,00:52:33.149,They could've found it in your eye.
00:52:33.191,00:52:36.112,They've got my picture plastered up all over the place.
00:52:36.152,00:52:39.865,I can't turn around without seeing my own face.
00:52:39.907,00:52:41.325,They'll recognize me.
00:52:41.366,00:52:42.534,They won't recognize you.
00:52:42.576,00:52:44.202,They'll recognize me.
00:52:44.244,00:52:46.413,I don't recognize you.
00:52:46.455,00:52:48.164,They won't marry the eyelash to you.
00:52:48.206,00:52:52.920,They won't believe that one of their elite could've suckered them all this time.
00:52:52.962,00:52:55.047,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:52:55.089,00:52:56.715,We do as we planned.
00:52:56.757,00:52:59.259,"You're Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1st Class."
00:52:59.301,00:53:04.140,I'm not Jerome Morrow.
00:53:04.180,00:53:05.516,W-what are you doing?
00:53:05.557,00:53:07.018,What are you doing?!
00:53:07.059,00:53:08.978,That's more than a day's worth!
00:53:09.020,00:53:11.313,Wait.
00:53:11.355,00:53:13.440,Stop that!
00:53:13.482,00:53:15.943,"Oh, fine. Fine."
00:53:15.985,00:53:17.153,You leave if you want.
00:53:17.193,00:53:18.946,But you're not taking that stuff.
00:53:18.988,00:53:21.573,That stuff is mine!
00:53:23.199,00:53:30.332,"I could've rented myself out to somebody with a spine, if I'd known you were gonna go belly-up on me at the last fucking gasp."
00:53:31.249,00:53:33.752,You can't quit on me now.
00:53:33.794,00:53:36.296,I've put too much into this.
00:53:36.338,00:53:41.217,"What do you want me to do, wheel in there and finish the job myself?"
00:53:41.259,00:53:44.972,"Eugene, they are going to find me."
00:53:46.891,00:53:49.101,"You still don't understand, do you?"
00:53:51.937,00:53:54.356,"When they look at you, they don't see you anymore."
00:53:54.398,00:53:56.525,They only see me.
00:54:11.123,00:54:13.792,Keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.
00:54:16.212,00:54:18.296,How could you be so careless?
00:54:51.247,00:54:53.289,I'm going out.
00:54:53.331,00:54:54.959,Where are you going?
00:54:55.000,00:54:58.712,"Um, well, if I'm gonna get arrested tomorrow, I'm gonna go out tonight."
00:54:58.754,00:55:00.965,"Are you sure that's a good idea, to go out?"
00:55:01.006,00:55:04.176,"Well, it was your idea not to change anything."
00:55:04.218,00:55:05.510,Who's going?
00:55:05.552,00:55:07.221,I'd say everybody.
00:55:08.264,00:55:09.723,Everybody.
00:55:09.765,00:55:12.559,"If I don't go, it'll look suspicious."
00:55:14.394,00:55:16.647,"You don't want to look suspicious, do you?"
00:55:21.277,00:55:22.861,Thanks.
00:56:23.005,00:56:24.798,Who ordered this?
00:56:24.840,00:56:26.717,What are we doing here?
00:56:26.758,00:56:28.635,I'm following a lead.
00:56:28.677,00:56:30.262,"Forgive me, sir, but that's what I do."
00:56:30.304,00:56:32.139,I'm a detective.
00:56:32.181,00:56:34.516,What makes you think the owner of the eyelash is here?
00:56:35.433,00:56:37.061,"He's an In-Valid, sir."
00:56:37.102,00:56:39.604,Where do we look for In-Valids but where In-Valids are?
00:56:39.646,00:56:41.357,He's an In-Valid.
00:56:42.900,00:56:46.444,He's an In-Valid clever enough to go unregistered all these years.
00:56:46.486,00:56:49.447,Do you think he's likely to lie down for us now?
00:56:49.489,00:56:51.075,"Well, what would you suggest, sir?"
00:56:51.116,00:56:53.202,Move the inquiry back to the scene.
00:56:53.244,00:56:55.579,"Draw a five-mile radius around Gattaca, sweep again."
00:56:55.620,00:56:56.914,Random stops.
00:57:19.644,00:57:22.606,You're a navigator?
00:57:22.647,00:57:25.150,"That's what it says, doesn't it?"
00:57:26.610,00:57:28.612,It doesn't say you're crippled.
00:57:28.653,00:57:31.489,I'm not crippled.
00:57:31.531,00:57:34.285,"I hurt my leg training, you moron."
00:57:35.535,00:57:37.329,How dare you question me.
00:57:37.371,00:57:38.538,"Yeah, right."
00:57:38.580,00:57:40.124,What's your number?
00:57:40.165,00:57:41.625,"All right, forget it."
00:57:41.666,00:57:44.295,"No! What's your number, you fucking flatfoot?"
00:57:44.336,00:57:46.422,"Look, I said forget it."
00:57:46.463,00:57:48.424,"Oh, it gets to you, doesn't it?"
00:57:48.465,00:57:51.468,It gets to you that I can do what you can only dream of.
00:57:51.509,00:57:53.804,I'm getting off this ball of dirt.
00:57:53.845,00:57:57.391,How dare you question me!
00:57:57.433,00:57:58.809,My mistake.
00:57:58.850,00:58:01.853,What's your number?
00:58:03.521,00:58:06.358,DETECTIVE: May I remind you that this is a crime scene?
00:58:06.400,00:58:08.485,What's this man doing here?
00:58:08.526,00:58:09.945,"What are you doing, old man?"
00:58:09.987,00:58:12.656,"Uh, doing my job, sir."
00:58:13.698,00:58:15.575,This is evidence.
00:58:15.617,00:58:17.119,But it's just trash.
00:59:09.671,00:59:11.673,You didn't know?
00:59:11.715,00:59:12.841,"Oh, yes. Yeah."
00:59:12.883,00:59:15.010,"Wonderful, wasn't it?"
00:59:16.720,00:59:19.223,"Twelve fingers or one, it's how you play."
00:59:20.849,00:59:23.227,That piece can only be played with 12.
00:59:41.537,00:59:43.247,What's all this about?
00:59:44.998,00:59:47.334,"Uh, it's probably nothing."
01:00:24.580,01:00:28.500,"Uh, you better not. Um-- I don't want to give you a contaminated specimen."
01:00:28.542,01:00:30.835,Get my meaning?
01:01:00.282,01:01:01.408,Thanks.
01:01:02.618,01:01:05.162,You never know where those swabs have been.
01:01:06.997,01:01:10.000,I want to show you something.
01:01:55.753,01:01:58.089,"Come on, we'll miss it!"
01:02:25.909,01:02:29.079,Come on. Come on.
01:03:15.584,01:03:17.544,What did I tell you?
01:03:38.356,01:03:40.692,IRENE: Strange.
01:03:40.734,01:03:42.819,Your eyes look different.
01:03:42.860,01:03:44.655,I guess it must be the light.
01:03:45.822,01:03:47.491,Must be.
01:04:10.305,01:04:11.807,DETECTIVE: Positive match.
01:04:11.848,01:04:14.476,I'm impressed.
01:04:14.518,01:04:16.978,The cup was definitely used since the original sweep?
01:04:17.937,01:04:19.690,"Two samples, two days."
01:04:19.731,01:04:24.736,Either the suspect went back to the scene of the crime to get a drink of water-- And I don't know anybody that thirsty.
01:04:24.778,01:04:26.112,--or he still works there.
01:04:26.154,01:04:28.824,I thought we checked all the service staff.
01:04:28.865,01:04:30.742,I don't think he cleans up the place anymore.
01:04:30.784,01:04:34.912,I have a feeling he might be there under false pretenses playing somebody else's hand.
01:04:34.954,01:04:37.415,A borrowed ladder...
01:04:37.457,01:04:38.416,at Gattaca?
01:04:38.458,01:04:41.586,"It's far-fetched, but it's not out of the realm of possibility."
01:04:41.628,01:04:44.422,I find it hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.
01:04:44.464,01:04:48.719,"Even if he got past their security system, he wouldn't have the mental faculty or the physical stamina."
01:04:48.760,01:04:50.303,Maybe you're underestimating him.
01:04:50.345,01:04:53.306,Maybe he is an impostor and maybe the director found out about him.
01:04:53.348,01:04:54.891,That could be his motive.
01:04:54.932,01:04:58.436,I say we sample every employee within the parameters intravenously.
01:04:58.478,01:05:00.564,Two-thirds of their work force fall into that category.
01:05:00.605,01:05:02.399,We'd be closing them down for days.
01:05:02.440,01:05:05.276,"No, a fingertip sample or urine should be sufficient."
01:05:05.318,01:05:08.822,I suggest blood from the vein.
01:05:08.864,01:05:10.448,I hope I'm not out of line.
01:05:21.752,01:05:24.504,Mandatory testing for all employees...
01:05:26.882,01:05:30.051,Please cooperate with the authorities.
01:05:38.309,01:05:42.480,"It's only a matter of time, sir."
01:05:45.483,01:05:47.819,"What's with the plungers, Lamar?"
01:05:51.239,01:05:52.990,You open up a blood bank?
01:05:53.032,01:06:00.498,"The, uh, gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods may have been compromised."
01:06:11.551,01:06:12.803,Ow!
01:06:12.844,01:06:15.054,Goddamn!
01:06:15.096,01:06:16.473,"What, are you out of practice, Lamar?"
01:06:16.514,01:06:17.808,"Here, let me look at that."
01:06:17.849,01:06:19.517,"Yeah, it's all right."
01:06:19.559,01:06:20.977,It's all right.
01:06:21.018,01:06:23.605,"Luckily, it looks as though we have enough."
01:06:23.647,01:06:27.651,"Well, if you need any more, you can always get it off his shoes."
01:06:42.958,01:06:45.084,Irene.
01:06:48.505,01:06:50.757,So you didn't do it after all?
01:06:50.799,01:06:55.011,"Uh, no, I-- I guess somebody beat me to it."
01:06:55.052,01:06:56.387,I guess.
01:06:58.765,01:07:00.099,Um...
01:07:03.394,01:07:05.271,I leave in two days.
01:07:06.189,01:07:10.902,"I mean, I-- I-I guess you know that."
01:07:10.944,01:07:12.320,"But, um..."
01:07:24.833,01:07:26.292,That's the last.
01:07:27.711,01:07:28.962,Something's not right.
01:07:29.004,01:07:31.130,He's not here.
01:07:31.172,01:07:34.217,"No, we missed something."
01:07:34.258,01:07:35.218,Test?
01:07:35.259,01:07:38.471,I cannot allow you to disrupt operations any further.
01:07:38.513,01:07:41.432,You're not at all concerned about having a murderer in your midst?
01:07:41.474,01:07:45.353,"Right now, your presence is creating more of a threat."
01:07:45.395,01:07:50.233,The window for our latest launch is open for seven days once every 70 years.
01:07:50.274,01:07:53.904,So it's rather crucial we leave on time.
01:07:53.945,01:07:56.990,"Mission means a great deal to you, doesn't it?"
01:07:57.032,01:08:00.284,"And your late colleague opposed it, didn't he?"
01:08:00.326,01:08:03.246,"DIRECTOR: Take another look at my profile, detective."
01:08:03.287,01:08:06.374,You won't find a violent bone in my body.
01:08:06.416,01:08:07.584,"My apologies, director."
01:08:07.625,01:08:09.502,He won't trouble you any further.
01:08:11.838,01:08:14.424,This is not the only place we can look.
01:08:15.842,01:08:17.134,Okay.
01:08:18.887,01:08:21.138,Let's start making the rounds.
01:09:23.159,01:09:25.912,I'm luckier than most.
01:09:25.954,01:09:27.413,Not as lucky as some.
01:09:29.666,01:09:31.126,I know something about that.
01:09:31.167,01:09:32.293,"You, Jerome?"
01:09:32.335,01:09:36.172,What heart problem did you ever have?
01:09:36.213,01:09:37.966,Did you get yours broken once?
01:09:43.179,01:09:49.268,I had this crazy idea that you were more interested in the murder case than me.
01:09:50.269,01:09:51.688,You're right.
01:09:55.066,01:09:56.776,That's a crazy idea.
01:10:00.363,01:10:01.990,Would you like to dance?
01:10:39.318,01:10:40.945,It's funny.
01:10:40.987,01:10:42.530,You work so hard.
01:10:42.572,01:10:53.083,"You do everything you can to get away from a place, and when you finally get your chance to leave, you find a reason to stay."
01:10:58.963,01:11:01.091,A year is a long time.
01:11:02.759,01:11:05.261,Not so long.
01:11:05.302,01:11:07.304,Just once around the sun.
01:11:17.232,01:11:18.482,"Hello, everyone."
01:11:18.524,01:11:20.068,I am your detective for the evening.
01:11:20.110,01:11:22.278,Please don't leave the premises.
01:11:23.446,01:11:25.115,DETECTIVE: I said nobody leave!
01:11:25.156,01:11:28.451,Am I speaking in some kind of strange foreign language?
01:11:28.492,01:11:31.037,"Check for hairpieces, check lenses, check dentures."
01:11:31.079,01:11:35.125,"I want napkins, I want cigarette butts, I want the saliva off tea cups."
01:11:36.542,01:11:39.254,That's a familiar face.
01:11:44.259,01:11:45.676,I thought you wanted to dance.
01:11:45.718,01:11:46.886,Excuse me.
01:11:46.928,01:11:49.639,"Oh, yeah."
01:11:49.680,01:11:51.015,Jerome!
01:11:52.391,01:11:54.060,Jerome!
01:12:01.776,01:12:04.154,Are you insane?!
01:12:22.588,01:12:24.090,Where did they go?
01:12:24.132,01:12:25.424,Where did they go?!
01:12:30.596,01:12:32.640,Come on. Come on.
01:12:42.942,01:12:44.235,Shh.
01:12:44.277,01:12:45.695,Don't you understand I can't do that?
01:12:45.736,01:12:47.905,Shh.
01:12:47.947,01:12:52.160,Don't touch your face!
01:12:52.202,01:12:54.245,Let's clean his teeth.
01:12:57.456,01:12:59.167,Vincent!
01:13:04.005,01:13:05.381,Vincent!
01:13:12.263,01:13:13.764,Who's Vincent?
01:13:19.354,01:13:20.813,I...
01:13:25.276,01:13:27.028,Don't say anything.
01:13:28.738,01:13:31.032,Don't say anything.
01:16:24.414,01:16:25.873,What happened?
01:16:29.752,01:16:31.337,The scars on your legs?
01:16:32.588,01:16:35.925,"Oh, uh..."
01:16:35.966,01:16:39.470,"Well, you remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?"
01:16:39.512,01:16:42.932,This is the exact height of the front fender.
01:16:42.973,01:16:45.351,Looked left instead of right.
01:16:49.397,01:16:52.649,"Did you just make that up, or do you use it all the time?"
01:16:52.691,01:16:54.402,I use it all the time.
01:16:56.612,01:16:59.615,I know you had something to do with the director's death.
01:16:59.656,01:17:01.992,"That's not true, Irene."
01:17:10.793,01:17:13.254,Isn't that the man from last night?
01:17:15.506,01:17:17.133,He's nobody.
01:17:27.560,01:17:30.146,He's one of our best.
01:17:30.187,01:17:33.566,I'm certain he has nothing to do with this business.
01:17:35.859,01:17:37.445,Jerome Morrow.
01:17:47.704,01:17:49.332,"You don't look well, Jerome."
01:17:50.749,01:17:52.543,Why don't you go home?
01:18:03.596,01:18:04.847,Can I help you?
01:18:04.888,01:18:06.516,I'm looking for Jerome Morrow.
01:18:06.557,01:18:08.309,I'm sorry. He's ill.
01:18:08.351,01:18:10.227,It's quite common before a mission.
01:18:10.269,01:18:12.104,Really?
01:18:12.146,01:18:13.564,I ought to pay him a visit.
01:18:13.606,01:18:16.025,I understand you can show me the way.
01:19:01.028,01:19:03.155,"You don't know who he is, do you, Irene?"
01:19:13.790,01:19:15.292,Shh.
01:19:22.717,01:19:24.093,Hello?
01:19:24.134,01:19:26.762,"Eugene, I need you to be yourself for the day."
01:19:26.803,01:19:29.181,I was never very good at it.
01:19:29.223,01:19:30.849,The investigators are coming by.
01:19:30.891,01:19:32.518,I'm supposed to be sick.
01:19:32.560,01:19:34.437,So you keep telling me.
01:19:34.478,01:19:35.479,How long have I got?
01:19:35.521,01:19:36.939,Not long.
01:21:25.214,01:21:27.090,I guess he's not home.
01:21:30.135,01:21:31.220,JEROME: Hello?
01:21:31.261,01:21:32.763,I'm here to see Jerome Morrow.
01:21:32.805,01:21:34.807,"Yes, that's me."
01:21:35.808,01:21:38.060,I guess he's home.
01:22:13.554,01:22:14.889,Come in.
01:22:17.641,01:22:18.975,Come in.
01:22:21.562,01:22:23.188,"Hello, sweetheart."
01:22:25.982,01:22:27.568,Where's my kiss?
01:22:31.196,01:22:34.157,Good to see you're feeling better.
01:22:34.199,01:22:38.328,"Of course, now that you're here."
01:22:47.003,01:22:50.466,Who's your friend?
01:22:50.507,01:22:51.926,How can I help?
01:22:51.967,01:22:54.678,It's about the director.
01:22:54.720,01:22:56.138,Oh. Again?
01:22:56.179,01:22:57.765,I hope it's no trouble.
01:22:57.807,01:22:58.724,"No, no. No trouble."
01:23:00.935,01:23:02.812,Forgive me for not giving you a guided tour.
01:23:02.853,01:23:04.271,Couldn't we do this another time?
01:23:04.313,01:23:06.231,"Well, this won't take a moment."
01:23:06.273,01:23:09.318,Maybe he can tell me what I've got.
01:23:46.021,01:23:48.190,Who were you expecting?
01:24:28.313,01:24:31.692,Yes.
01:24:31.734,01:24:33.193,"DETECTIVE: We have our man, sir."
01:24:33.235,01:24:34.778,You have him?
01:24:34.820,01:24:36.279,I'll come right away.
01:25:00.470,01:25:02.848,"How are you, Jerome?"
01:25:02.890,01:25:04.934,"Not bad, Jerome."
01:25:07.686,01:25:09.772,How the hell did you get up here?
01:25:09.813,01:25:10.981,"Oh, I could always walk."
01:25:11.023,01:25:13.567,I've been faking it.
01:25:29.875,01:25:32.377,VINCENT: Irene. Irene.
01:25:32.419,01:25:34.046,Irene.
01:25:34.088,01:25:35.171,"Listen to me, Irene."
01:25:35.213,01:25:36.548,I don't even know who you are.
01:25:36.590,01:25:39.843,I'm the same person I was yesterday.
01:25:39.885,01:25:41.845,"I can't hear any more of your lies, Jerome."
01:25:41.887,01:25:45.808,My name is Vincent. All right?
01:25:45.849,01:25:49.311,"And I'm a faith birth or a de-gene-erate, whatever you wanna call it."
01:25:49.352,01:25:51.772,But I'm not a murderer.
01:25:53.857,01:25:55.275,You're a God-child?
01:25:56.860,01:25:59.696,But we do have one thing in common.
01:25:59.738,01:26:02.574,Only I don't have 20 or 30 years left in mine.
01:26:02.616,01:26:04.493,"Mine is already 10,000 beats overdue."
01:26:05.368,01:26:07.788,It's not possible.
01:26:07.830,01:26:10.874,You are the authority on what is not possible.
01:26:10.916,01:26:12.375,"Aren't you, Irene?"
01:26:14.795,01:26:20.676,They have got you looking so hard for any flaw that after a while that's all that you see.
01:26:23.345,01:26:28.517,"For whatever it's worth, I'm here to tell you that it is possible."
01:26:29.977,01:26:31.812,It is possible.
01:27:10.851,01:27:14.771,"Congratulations, sir."
01:27:14.813,01:27:17.524,His spit was found in the dead director's eye.
01:27:17.566,01:27:19.026,An unaccounted for specimen.
01:27:19.068,01:27:24.364,"While I was busy obsessing about an eyelash, your instincts took us in the right direction."
01:27:24.406,01:27:27.325,So the In-Valid had nothing to do with this?
01:27:27.367,01:27:29.244,"No, our friend here acted alone."
01:27:29.285,01:27:32.372,"This mission meant everything to him, didn't it?"
01:27:36.919,01:27:40.380,"He knows that if they miss this launch window, he wouldn't live to see the next one."
01:27:40.422,01:27:45.677,"And since nothing can stop the launch now, he's being very, very cooperative."
01:27:49.514,01:27:53.351,"So I imagine you'll be celebrating tonight, sir."
01:27:53.393,01:27:54.978,Of course.
01:28:12.162,01:28:13.538,I think she likes us.
01:28:15.124,01:28:16.750,"Yeah, sure. Just give her a little bit of time."
01:28:16.792,01:28:19.211,She'll get used to the idea.
01:28:19.253,01:28:20.587,What was he like?
01:28:20.629,01:28:22.422,Who? The cop?
01:28:22.464,01:28:24.591,He was just a cop.
01:28:24.633,01:28:26.635,"Actually, my name was the topic of conversation."
01:28:26.676,01:28:28.178,"Yeah, well, he'll be back."
01:28:28.220,01:28:30.139,"You heard what he said, they have their man."
01:28:30.180,01:28:33.349,It's over.
01:28:33.391,01:28:34.434,I have to meet him.
01:29:00.961,01:29:02.296,Vincent?
01:29:13.098,01:29:14.599,"My God, you have changed."
01:29:18.353,01:29:21.190,Has it been so long you don't recognize your own brother?
01:29:21.231,01:29:23.275,Are we brothers?
01:29:23.317,01:29:26.695,Our parents both died thinking they'd outlived you.
01:29:28.238,01:29:29.405,I had my doubts.
01:29:29.447,01:29:31.741,"What are you doing here, Anton?"
01:29:31.783,01:29:34.077,I should ask you that question.
01:29:34.119,01:29:36.205,I have a right to be here.
01:29:36.246,01:29:37.831,You don't.
01:29:39.249,01:29:42.211,You almost sound as if you believe that.
01:29:42.252,01:29:44.587,I committed no murder.
01:29:45.588,01:29:47.966,You must be disappointed.
01:29:48.008,01:29:50.302,You committed fraud.
01:29:52.679,01:29:55.015,You're in a lot of trouble.
01:29:55.057,01:29:57.559,Do you have any idea what it took to get in here?
01:29:57.600,01:29:59.393,You've gone as far as you can go.
01:29:59.435,01:30:01.521,You come with me now.
01:30:01.563,01:30:03.899,There's still a few million miles left to go.
01:30:03.940,01:30:05.192,It's over.
01:30:05.234,01:30:07.319,"Is that the only way you can succeed, is to see me fail?"
01:30:07.361,01:30:14.076,I'm telling you-- God! Even you are gonna tell me what I can and can't do now?
01:30:14.117,01:30:18.538,"In case you haven't noticed, I don't need any rescuing."
01:30:19.497,01:30:21.250,But you did once.
01:30:22.959,01:30:25.419,"Well, you've got all the answers."
01:30:25.461,01:30:27.714,How do you explain that?
01:30:27.756,01:30:29.966,You didn't beat me that day.
01:30:31.593,01:30:33.220,Who are you trying to convince?
01:30:34.512,01:30:36.265,Do you want me to prove it to you?
01:30:36.306,01:30:39.517,"It's not important, Anton."
01:30:39.559,01:30:41.186,It's forgotten.
01:30:42.062,01:30:43.437,I'll prove it to you.
01:30:43.479,01:30:44.438,Do you want me to prove it to you?!
01:30:44.480,01:30:46.524,I'll prove it to you!
01:30:46.566,01:30:48.235,I do.
01:31:53.507,01:31:55.010,ANTON: Vincent!
01:31:56.219,01:31:57.846,Vincent!
01:31:59.055,01:32:01.099,Where's the shore?
01:32:01.141,01:32:02.142,You wanna quit?
01:32:02.184,01:32:03.226,We're too far out!
01:32:03.268,01:32:04.686,You wanna quit?
01:32:06.021,01:32:07.356,No.
01:32:30.295,01:32:32.630,Vincent!
01:32:32.672,01:32:34.799,"How are you doing this, Vincent?"
01:32:36.550,01:32:39.262,How have you done any of this?
01:32:39.304,01:32:40.305,We have to go back.
01:32:40.347,01:32:41.639,It's too late for that.
01:32:41.681,01:32:43.850,We're closer to the other side.
01:32:43.892,01:32:46.728,What other side?
01:32:48.313,01:32:50.564,You wanna know how I did it?
01:32:50.606,01:32:52.692,"This is how I did it, Anton."
01:32:52.734,01:32:55.569,I never saved anything for the swim back.
01:34:40.008,01:34:42.135,"You couldn't see, could you?"
01:34:43.677,01:34:45.972,"That night, crossing the street."
01:34:47.723,01:34:49.434,You crossed anyway.
01:35:04.616,01:35:09.412,"If you're still interested, let me know."
01:35:16.378,01:35:17.711,Sorry.
01:35:22.425,01:35:23.926,The wind caught it.
01:36:17.771,01:36:20.609,"You're flying today, aren't you?"
01:36:20.650,01:36:23.111,Look at what a mess you're in.
01:36:26.822,01:36:27.823,Come on.
01:36:27.865,01:36:29.701,I have your samples ready.
01:36:31.035,01:36:33.037,I don't need any samples where I'm going.
01:36:37.083,01:36:39.127,You might when you get back.
01:36:42.756,01:36:45.634,Everything you need to last you two lifetimes.
01:36:48.595,01:36:50.221,Why have you done all this?
01:36:51.556,01:36:54.976,So Jerome will always be here when you need him.
01:36:55.017,01:36:56.770,Where are you going?
01:36:56.810,01:36:59.063,I'm traveling too.
01:37:02.651,01:37:05.361,I don't know how to thank you.
01:37:06.820,01:37:08.615,"No, no."
01:37:08.657,01:37:11.451,I got the better end of the deal.
01:37:11.493,01:37:13.202,I only lent you my body.
01:37:14.912,01:37:17.290,You lent me your dream.
01:37:27.008,01:37:29.093,Not until you're upstairs.
01:38:02.711,01:38:03.795,What is this?
01:38:03.837,01:38:05.839,New policy.
01:38:12.804,01:38:14.347,Flight got you nervous?
01:38:15.849,01:38:17.517,"Well, there's a problem, Lamar."
01:38:17.559,01:38:21.062,"I never did tell you about my son, did I?"
01:38:21.103,01:38:22.980,He's a big fan of yours.
01:38:27.318,01:38:32.990,Just remember that I was as good as any and better than most.
01:38:33.032,01:38:34.826,He wants to apply here.
01:38:34.868,01:38:37.078,I could have gone up and back.
01:38:37.119,01:38:38.788,And nobody would've been the wiser.
01:38:38.830,01:38:43.418,"Unfortunately, my son's not all that they promised."
01:38:44.794,01:38:47.921,"But then, who knows what he could do?"
01:38:49.465,01:38:51.175,Right?
01:39:07.983,01:39:13.989,"For future reference, right-handed men don't hold it with their left."
01:39:14.031,01:39:16.158,Just one of those things.
01:39:28.880,01:39:31.549,"You're gonna miss your flight, Vincent."
01:42:18.131,01:42:25.347,"VINCENT: For someone who was never meant for this world, I must confess, I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it."
01:42:27.100,01:42:31.520,"Of course, they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star."
01:42:32.438,01:42:34.941,Maybe I'm not leaving.
01:42:35.858,01:42:38.193,Maybe I'm going home.
