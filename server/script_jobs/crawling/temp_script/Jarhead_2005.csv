00:00:33.826,00:00:37.329,"And afterward, he turns the rifle in at the armory..."
00:00:37.371,00:00:39.832,and he believes he's finished with the rifle.
00:00:41.124,00:00:44.503,But no matter what else he might do with his hands...
00:00:44.545,00:00:54.304,"love a woman, build a house, change his son's diaper-- his hands remember the rifle."
00:00:54.346,00:00:56.264,You are no longer black...
00:00:56.306,00:00:59.935,or brown or yellow or red!
00:01:00.143,00:01:02.145,You are now green!
00:01:02.145,00:01:05.983,You are light green or dark green!
00:01:06.025,00:01:08.027,Do you understand?
00:01:08.151,00:01:10.029,"Sir, yes, sir!"
00:01:10.153,00:01:12.322,-Swofford.
00:01:12.364,00:01:15.283,You the maggot whose father served in Vietnam?
00:01:15.325,00:01:17.327,"-Sir, yes, sir."
00:01:17.369,00:01:19.287,Did he have the balls to die there?
00:01:19.329,00:01:22.165,"-Sir, no, sir!"
00:01:22.165,00:01:24.418,-He ever talk about it?
00:01:24.459,00:01:27.170,Good.
00:01:28.296,00:01:31.050,Are you eyeballing me with those baby blues?
00:01:31.174,00:01:33.176,-Are you?
00:01:33.176,00:01:36.221,"-Are you in love with me, Swofford?"
00:01:36.263,00:01:39.975,"Oh, you don't think I look good in my uniform, Swofford?"
00:01:40.017,00:01:42.853,"Sir, the drill sergeant looks fabulous in his uniform, sir!"
00:01:42.895,00:01:45.981,"Oh, so you're gay then, and you love me, huh?"
00:01:46.023,00:01:47.441,"Sir, I'm not gay, sir!"
00:01:47.482,00:01:49.818,"Do you have a girlfriend, Swofford?"
00:01:49.860,00:01:52.071,"-Sir, yes, sir!"
00:01:52.195,00:01:54.197,Jody's banging her right now!
00:01:54.197,00:01:58.201,Get on your face and give me 25 for every time she gets fucked this month.
00:01:58.201,00:02:00.788,Down on your face!
00:02:00.829,00:02:04.249,It was shortly after meeting Drill Instructor Fitch...
00:02:04.291,00:02:08.879,that I realized that joining the Marine Corps might have been a bad decision.
00:02:08.921,00:02:11.465,What in the fuck is this?
00:02:11.506,00:02:14.093,"Sir, it's the recruit's drawing of a foot locker, sir."
00:02:14.217,00:02:17.220,"Jesus, Joseph and doggy-style Mary!"
00:02:17.220,00:02:19.264,That is a pile of dog shit.
00:02:19.306,00:02:21.433,"Sir, the recruit's never been good at drawing, sir!"
00:02:21.475,00:02:24.019,Why the fuck are you my scribe then?
00:02:24.061,00:02:26.271,Isn't my scribe supposed to know how to draw?
00:02:26.313,00:02:28.899,"Sir, the recruit doesn't know."
00:02:28.941,00:02:31.693,"-to write, sir!"
00:02:31.735,00:02:36.239,The recruit doesn't know because I haven't told him!
00:02:36.239,00:02:43.038,"-All right, come-for-brains, show me exactly where your skivvies -and running shoes go."
00:02:40.744,00:02:45.248,"-Sir, the recruit can't think while the drill instructor's hitting him on his head, sir."
00:02:45.248,00:02:48.293,You can't think while I'm giving you a few love taps?
00:02:48.335,00:02:50.963,How the fuck are you going to fire your rifle...
00:02:51.005,00:02:54.549,when grenades are going off in your face?
00:02:54.591,00:02:56.885,What the fuck are you even doing here?
00:02:56.927,00:02:59.930,"Sir, I got lost on the way to college, sir!"
00:03:06.645,00:03:30.127,"So now my hands were dick skinners, a flashlight was a moonbeam, a pen was an ink stick, my mouth was a come receptacle, a bed was a rack, a wall was a bulkhead, a shirt was a blouse, a tie was still a tie and a belt a belt, but many other things would never be the same."
00:03:38.802,00:03:40.303,"One, two, three-- three."
00:04:12.335,00:04:15.338,Swofford.
00:04:17.007,00:04:18.508,It's English.
00:04:18.550,00:04:22.804,My great-grandfather came over here in the 19th century.
00:04:22.846,00:04:24.681,Whatever.
00:04:24.723,00:04:27.768,I'm putting you in Golf Company.
00:04:27.809,00:04:29.895,It's full of retards and fuck-ups.
00:04:29.937,00:04:33.523,Maybe you can elevate the sons of bitches a little.
00:04:34.357,00:04:36.777,Or maybe not.
00:04:38.862,00:04:39.613,Next.
00:04:46.369,00:04:51.250,"Jarhead, noun-- slang for marine."
00:04:51.374,00:04:52.375,Origin...
00:04:52.375,00:04:54.044,from the resemblance to a jar...
00:04:54.086,00:04:57.881,of the regulation high-and-tight haircut.
00:04:57.923,00:05:04.387,"The marine's head, by implication, therefore also a jar, an empty vessel."
00:05:12.395,00:05:16.399,Hey! Can I help you?
00:05:16.399,00:05:19.527,"Uh, yeah."
00:05:19.569,00:05:22.072,-Second platoon?
00:05:27.661,00:05:31.123,"-What's going on, boss?"
00:05:31.165,00:05:32.916,-Welcome to second platoon.
00:05:32.958,00:05:35.169,"Hey, boys, fresh fucking meat!"
00:06:06.700,00:06:09.203,Fuck!
00:06:11.454,00:06:15.000,"-Boo, motherfucker!"
00:06:22.007,00:06:23.466,Get some!
00:06:32.475,00:06:35.020,"Oh, fuck."
00:06:50.577,00:06:53.330,"Yeah, we switched out the hot brand."
00:06:53.997,00:06:56.666,A little fuck-fuck trick we play on the new guys.
00:06:59.002,00:07:00.003,Nice.
00:07:01.504,00:07:04.132,"You want a brand, you gotta earn it."
00:07:10.513,00:07:12.515,Welcome to the suck.
00:07:31.285,00:07:33.828,"Still got that stomach flu, Swofford?"
00:07:33.870,00:07:36.081,I can't seem to shake it.
00:07:36.123,00:07:39.167,That's all right.
00:07:39.209,00:07:41.753,But for me there was nowhere else.
00:07:41.795,00:07:43.546,That was the truth.
00:07:43.546,00:07:45.882,"After all, I was made in a war."
00:07:46.967,00:07:48.551,Here's Mr.
00:07:48.551,00:07:53.556,"on R&amp;R from Vietnam, Honolulu Hilton, 1969."
00:07:54.557,00:07:59.146,"I can't watch, and neither can you."
00:07:59.187,00:08:02.357,And here's some other things I can't show you.
00:08:02.399,00:08:04.567,Visiting my sister.
00:08:04.567,00:08:07.862,Making muffins with Mom.
00:08:10.573,00:08:13.576,Breakfast conversations with Dad.
00:08:15.162,00:08:17.580,But here's some things you can see.
00:08:17.580,00:08:18.832,Taking a dump.
00:08:19.624,00:08:22.461,Thinking about going to college.
00:08:22.585,00:08:25.130,Studying after school with my girlfriend.
00:08:25.172,00:08:28.591,"-Oh, my God, I love you."
00:08:28.591,00:08:32.595,Giving away my favorite U.S.M.C. T-shirt.
00:08:32.595,00:08:33.638,I'll write you every day.
00:08:33.680,00:08:34.973,Hey!
00:08:37.100,00:08:38.393,Swofford?
00:08:42.105,00:08:44.732,-Swofford.
00:08:46.818,00:08:50.071,What the fuck?
00:08:50.113,00:08:52.866,"Oh, no, I just had a stomach thing, sir."
00:08:52.907,00:08:56.619,Staff Sergeant Sykes.
00:08:56.619,00:09:03.626,"I heard it took six guys to pull that little branding trick on you, and your file says that you ain't too fucking dumb either, so you better get un-sick most motherfucking ricky-tick..."
00:09:03.626,00:09:07.214,because there's a chance that you could be a scout/sniper.
00:09:09.841,00:09:12.302,What the fuck is this?
00:09:13.928,00:09:16.181,"The Stranger, by Camus."
00:09:16.223,00:09:18.475,"That's some heavy dope right there, marine."
00:09:18.517,00:09:25.857,"Mary, however--  Indoc class starts on Monday."
00:09:25.899,00:09:27.526,"Is that an order, Staff Sergeant?"
00:09:30.195,00:09:32.655,"Uh, no."
00:09:32.655,00:09:34.908,It's a fucking opportunity.
00:09:34.949,00:09:37.202,It's a fucking honor.
00:09:37.244,00:09:39.871,It's the best fucking job in the marine corps.
00:09:40.372,00:09:42.416,"Sounds good, Staff Sergeant."
00:09:43.833,00:09:46.669,"-Sounds good, Staff Sergeant."
00:09:46.669,00:09:48.713,-Could I have my-- You know what?
00:09:48.755,00:09:52.217,I got a better idea.
00:09:53.176,00:09:55.429,"I played a trumpet in third grade, Staff Sergeant."
00:09:55.470,00:09:57.472,Played a trumpet in third grade?
00:09:57.514,00:10:02.643,"A little, for small holiday concerts and festivals-- You ain't gotta be Chuck Mangione."
00:10:02.685,00:10:06.189,"Somebody to play taps, reveille, battle march, that type of shit-- raise the morale."
00:10:06.231,00:10:08.024,-Does that interest you?
00:10:08.066,00:10:10.651,Good.
00:10:10.693,00:10:13.572,"-All right, thank you, Staff Sergeant."
00:10:13.613,00:10:19.369,-Can I get my boo-- There's 60 of you.
00:10:19.411,00:10:22.330,That means 52 of you will perish.
00:10:22.372,00:10:25.292,There's no possible way that all of you can make it.
00:10:25.333,00:10:27.961,-If you think you were some shit-- -Staff Sergeant Sykes!
00:10:28.002,00:10:31.672,Private Swofford reporting for bugle tryout!
00:10:31.714,00:10:34.259,"Indoc, atten-hut!"
00:10:36.303,00:10:42.683,"I don't give out too many special treats, but this morning, we have a very special treat."
00:10:42.725,00:10:46.896,Private Swofford here is going to play reveille for us.
00:10:47.772,00:10:49.857,"Okay, Swofford, play reveille."
00:10:50.900,00:10:52.611,"Oh, I don't have a bugle."
00:10:52.652,00:10:54.821,-You don't have a what?
00:10:54.862,00:10:57.782,"No, no, no, no."
00:10:57.824,00:10:59.659,You better play it with your mouth.
00:11:01.744,00:11:02.787,What?
00:11:02.829,00:11:05.748,I said play it with your goddamn mouth.
00:11:13.047,00:11:16.759,Fuck.
00:11:24.767,00:11:26.603,I love that tone.
00:11:26.645,00:11:28.938,My morale is lifted.
00:11:28.980,00:11:30.940,You know You are the Sunshine of My Life?
00:11:30.982,00:11:33.318,"-Yes, Staff Sergeant."
00:11:48.791,00:11:50.960,Will you shut the fuck up?
00:11:51.002,00:11:54.422,"There is no bugle program, you sizzle-dick motherfucker."
00:11:54.464,00:11:56.966,"Who do you think you are, some kinda Kenny G or some shit?"
00:11:57.008,00:11:58.593,"-No, Staff Sergeant."
00:11:58.635,00:12:00.970,"Now, to the rest of you, do you have what it takes..."
00:12:01.012,00:12:06.685,"to be the meanest, the cruelest, the most savage unforgiving motherfuckers in God's cruel kingdom?"
00:12:06.809,00:12:08.102,"Yes, Staff Sergeant!"
00:12:08.144,00:12:09.812,"To be able to one day say, Yea, though I walk..."
00:12:09.812,00:12:15.818,"through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, because I am the baddest motherfucker in the goddamn valley?"
00:12:15.818,00:12:16.861,"Yes, Staff Sergeant!"
00:12:16.903,00:12:19.113,We shall fucking see.
00:12:19.155,00:12:21.241,-You still here?
00:12:21.282,00:12:23.410,"Yes, what?"
00:12:25.203,00:12:28.206,"Yes, I am still here, Staff Sergeant."
00:12:28.873,00:12:31.042,So fucking be it.
00:12:31.084,00:12:32.835,One mile.
00:12:32.835,00:12:34.504,-Ain't shit.
00:12:34.546,00:12:36.715,Your mission is to kill me.
00:12:36.839,00:12:39.217,"My mission is to kill you first, and I'm good."
00:12:39.259,00:12:42.220,Them paintball bullets-- they hurt?
00:12:43.179,00:12:45.265,"Aw, shit!"
00:12:45.306,00:12:48.851,"-Fuck, I can't see!"
00:12:48.851,00:12:53.690,"In order to engage your target, you must see your target, but your target must not see you."
00:12:53.732,00:12:55.858,Shevitz.
00:12:57.652,00:13:00.154,"You laugh, you die."
00:13:00.196,00:13:02.949,"You shift your weight to take a piss, you will die."
00:13:02.990,00:13:04.867,"You wanna shit, you better shit in your pants."
00:13:04.909,00:13:07.036,"Still kinda cute, huh, Swoff?"
00:13:07.078,00:13:10.248,"-No, sir."
00:13:10.290,00:13:12.250,"You will become a tree, a rock."
00:13:12.292,00:13:14.001,"You are mud, sand and dust."
00:13:14.043,00:13:16.087,-Still funny?
00:13:16.129,00:13:20.883,"In order to fire accurately, you must be able to judge distance and wind direction."
00:13:20.883,00:13:22.885,How far are those trees?
00:13:22.885,00:13:24.971,No.
00:13:25.012,00:13:26.889,-300. How did you figure that?
00:13:26.889,00:13:28.891,"-Uh, three football fields."
00:13:28.891,00:13:31.686,That's right.
00:13:31.728,00:13:33.062,Please don't use your dicks.
00:13:33.104,00:13:34.522,"They're too small, and I can't count that high."
00:13:34.564,00:13:38.109,"-I don't want to hear 400,000 inches."
00:13:38.151,00:13:39.694,"Now, wind."
00:13:38.151,00:13:41.904,"You use what you have-- use a flag, use a plume of smoke, a little bit of dust."
00:13:41.904,00:13:44.073,Spit on your finger and hold that bitch up.
00:13:44.115,00:13:48.745,"These are formulas that you can use, but in the end you have to trust your gut."
00:13:48.787,00:13:51.539,"Details, gentlemen."
00:13:51.581,00:13:54.417,between you killing your target and your target killing you.
00:13:54.459,00:13:57.545,We've all been taught that Thou shalt not kill.
00:13:58.004,00:14:00.006,But hear this.
00:14:00.047,00:14:02.925,Fuck that shit!
00:14:02.925,00:14:05.052,Now consider your target.
00:14:06.929,00:14:09.182,"If you are lucky, in that window..."
00:14:09.223,00:14:12.393,will one day emerge the figure of the enemy.
00:14:12.435,00:14:13.936,The J.F.K. shot.
00:14:13.936,00:14:16.773,The pink mist.
00:14:16.815,00:14:18.941,Fire. Fire. Fire.
00:14:20.819,00:14:22.403,Hit.
00:14:25.782,00:14:29.952,Fire. Fire. Fire.
00:14:29.952,00:14:31.621,that you are hearing...
00:14:31.663,00:14:33.080,are live rounds.
00:14:33.122,00:14:35.834,You will get the fear out of you.
00:14:35.958,00:14:38.503,"If you pick your head up, you will get fucked up."
00:14:38.545,00:14:40.421,Find out if we have any bitch in you.
00:14:40.463,00:14:43.675,You guys crawl like old people fuck!
00:14:45.259,00:14:47.970,Keep moving.
00:14:47.970,00:14:50.348,Keep moving.
00:14:50.390,00:14:53.017,-I can't!
00:14:53.059,00:14:54.977,"-Come on, man."

00:15:09.492,00:15:11.703,-I can't!
00:15:12.787,00:15:14.163,-Cease fire!
00:15:14.205,00:15:16.123,Cease fire!
00:15:20.002,00:15:21.629,Shit!
00:15:26.885,00:15:28.344,Shit.
00:15:30.597,00:15:33.892,I told you to keep your fucking head down!
00:15:30.597,00:15:37.812,"If you listened to me, you would still be fucking alive right now, stupid fuck!"
00:15:46.654,00:15:50.324,"God help me, you are now scout/snipers."
00:15:50.366,00:15:54.036,"Now, I know you've heard this, but I'm going to tell it to you again."
00:15:54.036,00:15:57.039,Snipers do not work alone.
00:15:57.039,00:15:59.083,You work as a team.
00:16:01.127,00:16:11.930,"Spotter, shooter, spotter, shooter, spotter, shooter, spotter, shooter."
00:16:12.054,00:16:16.350,"You may now open your case, pull out your M40A1 rifles."
00:16:20.104,00:16:24.066,"Once you've done that, you will repeat after me."
00:16:24.066,00:16:26.193,This is my rifle.
00:16:26.235,00:16:29.155,This is my rifle.
00:16:29.196,00:16:32.366,"There are many like it, but this one is mine."
00:16:32.408,00:16:35.077,"There are many like it, but this one is mine."
00:16:35.077,00:16:38.080,"Without my rifle, I am nothing."
00:16:38.122,00:16:40.374,"Without my rifle, I am nothing."
00:16:40.416,00:16:43.962,"Without me, my rifle is nothing."
00:16:44.086,00:16:46.506,"Without me, my rifle is nothing."
00:16:48.090,00:16:52.762,"The grunt dies for 15,000 poorly-placed rounds."
00:16:52.804,00:16:54.263,Fucking right.
00:16:54.305,00:17:00.561,The sniper dies for that one perfect shot.
00:17:02.146,00:17:05.191,Hit.
00:17:05.232,00:17:08.945,Fire. Fire. Fire.
00:17:08.987,00:17:11.113,I was hooked.
00:17:11.113,00:17:12.907,Hit.
00:17:15.117,00:17:18.120,Fire. Fire. Fire.
00:17:18.120,00:17:19.372,Hit.
00:17:23.626,00:17:27.296,Fire. Fire. Fire.
00:17:27.338,00:17:28.840,Hit.
00:17:30.508,00:17:33.302,I wanted the pink mist.
00:17:36.138,00:17:41.019,Good evening.
00:17:41.143,00:17:42.812,That set off worldwide protest...
00:17:42.854,00:17:46.524,"and drew sanctions from the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union."
00:17:46.566,00:17:48.776,The government of dictator Saddam Hussein...
00:17:48.818,00:17:52.154,claimed it went in at the invitation of revolutionaries...
00:17:52.154,00:17:54.365,who had overthrown the Kuwaiti government.
00:17:54.407,00:18:05.668,"We have appealed to all our friends around the world, including the United States, to come to our aid and assistance."
00:18:11.674,00:18:14.176,We're going to fucking war.
00:18:50.212,00:18:52.090,Shoot 'em.
00:18:54.216,00:18:56.218,"- Los niños, los niños."
00:19:20.242,00:19:22.120,Oorah!
00:19:28.417,00:19:30.086,Shoot that motherfucker!
00:19:40.262,00:19:42.473,"Run, Charlie!"
00:19:45.392,00:19:48.521,Now hear this. Now hear this.
00:19:48.562,00:19:54.276,All personnel from 2-7 are to report immediately to your company area.
00:19:54.276,00:19:56.278,"- Get some, marines!"
00:19:56.278,00:19:58.156,Get some!
00:19:58.280,00:20:00.449,Oorah!
00:20:12.294,00:20:13.963,"Me, I had a choice."
00:20:14.005,00:20:16.465,Either join the marines or go to jail.
00:20:16.507,00:20:18.551,And you know what the shit of it is?
00:20:18.592,00:20:21.261,"-If you'd gone to jail-- -Don't spoil the joke, asshole."
00:20:21.303,00:20:24.473,"-If I'd have went to jail, I'd be getting..."
00:20:25.558,00:20:27.434,-Would you like some nuts?
00:20:27.476,00:20:30.396,"Yes, uh, are they warm nuts?"
00:20:30.437,00:20:33.524,"No, I believe they're room temperature."
00:20:33.566,00:20:37.528,"Well, uh, maybe later you can come and warm up my nuts."
00:20:37.570,00:20:39.739,"You know, I don't really like the little ones."
00:20:40.698,00:20:43.283,-Okay.
00:20:43.325,00:20:45.036,Would you like some nuts?
00:20:45.078,00:20:47.205,"Man, you poor bastard."
00:20:47.246,00:20:50.041,"I bet your recruiter promised you a whole wide world of pussy, huh?"
00:20:50.083,00:20:51.792,You're fuckin'-A.
00:20:51.834,00:20:53.544,Cocksucker knew the price of every whore from Olongapo to Stockholm.
00:20:53.586,00:20:56.380,"And here we are, headed to the desert."
00:20:56.422,00:20:58.632,Fucked by the green wienie again.
00:21:00.259,00:21:02.636,"Hey, what would you be doing if you were a civilian?"
00:21:02.678,00:21:07.558,"Staying up late jacking off, playing Metroid trying to get to that ninth level?"
00:21:07.600,00:21:11.229,You know what happens when you get there?
00:21:11.353,00:21:13.064,Nothing.
00:21:13.106,00:21:15.357,Just start all over again.
00:21:15.357,00:21:16.901,So how long you think we'll be there?
00:21:16.943,00:21:18.861,Two weeks?
00:21:18.903,00:21:20.404,"Less, man."
00:21:18.903,00:21:22.364,"We'll be back so fast, you'll still be shitting out those nuts."
00:21:22.364,00:21:25.785,Good luck now.
00:21:25.826,00:21:28.121,Good luck now.
00:21:28.162,00:21:31.373,-You wanna keep me company for two weeks? Huh?
00:21:31.373,00:21:34.668,"-You don't know what you're missing, baby."
00:21:34.710,00:21:36.254,Damn!
00:22:24.468,00:22:26.179,Attention on deck!
00:22:30.432,00:22:32.810,Take your seats.
00:22:36.522,00:22:39.441,"-Good afternoon, marines."
00:22:39.441,00:22:42.862,"Jesus, did you just land in a war zone or a funeral parlor?"
00:22:42.903,00:22:45.447,"-Good afternoon, marines!"
00:22:45.447,00:22:47.574,"Ooh, I just felt my dick move."
00:22:49.451,00:22:54.665,"For those of you who don't know me, I'm Lieutenant Colonel Kazinski, your battalion commander."
00:22:54.707,00:22:57.710,We're now part of Operation Desert Shield.
00:22:57.751,00:23:04.466,"Now, just north of us, Saddam Hussein's got one million Iraqi soldiers."
00:23:04.466,00:23:06.510,And some of those boys have been fighting...
00:23:06.552,00:23:09.013,since you were nine or 10 years old.
00:23:09.055,00:23:12.892,They are tough.
00:23:12.933,00:23:16.478,They've used nerve gas against the Iranians and the Kurds.
00:23:16.478,00:23:18.147,"Now, here's a picture."
00:23:25.863,00:23:27.907,"Now, I know what you're thinking."
00:23:27.948,00:23:30.492,"You're thinking, Let's kick ass and take names..."
00:23:30.492,00:23:33.287,and end this shit the day before yesterday.
00:23:33.329,00:23:34.788,Oorah!
00:23:34.830,00:23:38.500,But the bureaucrats have a lot of jawboning to do.
00:23:38.500,00:23:43.505,"So for now, these Iraqis who have raped and pillaged poor little Kuwait..."
00:23:43.505,00:23:45.632,are not yet in our gun sights.
00:23:47.009,00:23:50.512,Our current mission is to protect the oil fields...
00:23:50.512,00:23:55.059,of our good friends in the kingdom of Saud until further notice.
00:23:55.101,00:23:59.605,"And, gentlemen, I'm talking a lot of oil."
00:23:59.646,00:24:02.524,A lot of oil.
00:24:02.524,00:24:09.740,"So you will hydrate, you will train, you will adjust to this desert, and you'll hydrate some more."
00:24:09.782,00:24:11.909,And you will be ready.
00:24:11.951,00:24:17.873,"You will maintain a constant state of suspicious alertness, and one day soon..."
00:24:17.915,00:24:21.210,Saddam Hussein is gonna regret pulling this sorry shit!
00:24:21.252,00:24:22.336,Oorah!
00:24:22.378,00:24:24.546,We're gonna kick some Iraqi ass!
00:24:24.546,00:24:27.133,What did you say?
00:24:27.174,00:24:29.593,"We're gonna kick some Iraqi ass, sir!"
00:24:29.635,00:24:31.929,"Oh, hell, son."
00:24:31.971,00:24:33.639,the Medal of Honor all by yourself?
00:24:33.680,00:24:36.850,-What's the rest of my battalion gonna do?
00:24:36.892,00:24:39.437,"You know, I think it's time for me to retire."
00:24:39.561,00:24:41.563,I can't hear a fucking thing!
00:24:41.563,00:24:43.565,Kick some Iraqi ass!
00:24:43.565,00:24:46.277,"Oh, boys, I just got a hard-on."
00:25:08.007,00:25:11.051,"Man, this defensive position shit sucks, huh?"
00:25:11.093,00:25:14.305,We need to get out of this shithole soon.
00:25:14.347,00:25:16.598,You're gonna get all you want soon enough.
00:25:16.598,00:25:19.101,-First to fucking fight.
00:25:19.143,00:25:21.061,Yeah. For what?
00:25:22.104,00:25:25.107,I've been around these old white fuckers all my life.
00:25:25.149,00:25:27.318,They got their fat hands in Arab oil.
00:25:27.360,00:25:29.736,The motherfuckers drink it like it's beer.
00:25:29.778,00:25:31.613,That's why we're here-- to protect their profits.
00:25:31.613,00:25:33.657,You're full of shit!
00:25:33.699,00:25:37.661,Who do you think gave Saddam all his fucking weapons?
00:25:37.703,00:25:38.496,We did.
00:25:38.620,00:25:40.706,"Fuck politics, all right?"
00:25:40.747,00:25:43.667,We're here.
00:25:43.709,00:25:45.419,Yeah.
00:26:13.947,00:26:16.658,"Everyone else is unpacking, man."
00:26:16.658,00:26:18.035,I'm taking a break.
00:26:20.496,00:26:23.665,-Whatcha got?
00:26:23.665,00:26:26.293,"-Oh, she's hot. Yours?"
00:26:26.335,00:26:28.546,"Well, you better shoot yourself in the foot..."
00:26:28.670,00:26:29.922,"and get a ticket home, because..."
00:26:29.963,00:26:32.550,Jodies are gonna be all over her!
00:26:32.674,00:26:34.218,Ooh!
00:26:36.178,00:26:38.764,"-That's nice for a white chick, man."
00:26:38.805,00:26:43.227,"Nice? Come on, I'd drink a gallon of her pee -just to see where it came from."
00:26:43.269,00:26:45.854,This is hard-core right here.
00:26:45.896,00:26:47.314,-Let me see that one.
00:26:47.356,00:26:50.692,"Hey, hey, all right."
00:26:50.692,00:26:52.694,"I'm storing that for later, man."
00:26:52.694,00:26:54.572,"-Hey, hey!"
00:26:54.696,00:26:56.990,"Hey, y'all horny fucks wanna see a beautiful woman?"
00:26:57.032,00:26:59.410,-Yes! Give it up!
00:26:59.452,00:27:01.995,-Check this out.
00:27:02.037,00:27:05.707,"-No, no, no, no."
00:27:05.707,00:27:07.918,Now tell him how many tortillas she had before that picture.
00:27:10.712,00:27:12.339,"Hey, she's pregnant, man."
00:27:15.134,00:27:17.219,"That's why she's so beautiful, man."
00:27:17.261,00:27:20.222,"This is what it's all about right here, man."
00:27:20.264,00:27:25.727,"Married guys-- I'm telling you, married guys lose brain cells by the billions."
00:27:25.727,00:27:28.355,"If the corps wanted you to have a wife, they would have issued you one."
00:27:28.397,00:27:31.317,"Yeah, they would have issued you one."
00:27:31.358,00:27:32.985,Yeah!
00:27:33.026,00:27:35.028,"No family photos, Swofford?"
00:27:37.197,00:27:40.242,"-Hey, can I see your pictures?"
00:27:40.284,00:27:42.286,Thanks.
00:27:42.328,00:27:43.787,"Fergus, right?"
00:27:44.580,00:27:46.290,Yeah.
00:27:48.750,00:27:50.461,She have her own clothes?
00:27:52.754,00:27:56.049,-Ain't this cozy as fuck?
00:27:56.091,00:28:00.762,"Well, if you're not too busy-- gas, gas, gas, right now! Gas!"
00:28:00.762,00:28:02.764,Let's go.
00:28:02.764,00:28:05.392,What the fuck are you doing?
00:28:05.434,00:28:07.645,Right now your dicks are falling off.
00:28:07.769,00:28:11.607,Let's go! Move it!
00:28:11.649,00:28:13.233,Didn't I tell you not to get lazy?
00:28:13.275,00:28:15.902,You still don't have shit.
00:28:15.944,00:28:19.865,"That's your fucking sleeping bag, you moron."
00:28:19.906,00:28:22.493,What the fuck are you doing?
00:28:22.535,00:28:24.411,"If you stay ready, you ain't got to get ready."
00:28:24.453,00:28:27.831,You nasty motherfuckers are so lazy.
00:28:27.873,00:28:30.167,Forty-five seconds.
00:28:30.209,00:28:32.794,What you doing?
00:28:32.794,00:28:35.214,You gonna be the first motherfucker I kick up in the ass.
00:28:35.255,00:28:37.216,Get it on!
00:28:37.257,00:28:40.802,"Retarded motherfuckers, let's go! Put it on!"
00:28:40.802,00:28:42.680,Let's go! Stop!
00:28:42.804,00:28:44.306,Stop it right now!
00:28:45.807,00:28:47.976,Luke.
00:28:48.018,00:28:50.812,"Come over to the dark side, Luke."
00:28:50.854,00:28:53.190,Fifty-five seconds.
00:28:53.232,00:28:55.817,You're all dead.
00:28:53.232,00:28:58.904,"And since you're all dead, I guess you wouldn't mind taking a little run in these suits."
00:28:58.945,00:28:59.821,Let's go!
00:29:07.329,00:29:11.833,"Swofford, if you don't pick it up, I'm gonna shoot you in your fucking foot!"
00:29:11.833,00:29:13.627,Move it!
00:29:13.669,00:29:15.879,The price of crude oil has nearly doubled.
00:29:15.921,00:29:18.382,President Bush sends in more troops.
00:29:19.966,00:29:23.845,Us-- six times a day we gather for formation.
00:29:23.845,00:29:26.848,"Drink it down, all of you."
00:29:26.848,00:29:28.308,Now hold 'em up.
00:29:32.854,00:29:34.106,We patrol the empty desert.
00:29:34.147,00:29:36.858,Get down!
00:29:38.652,00:29:40.446,And we dehydrate.
00:29:47.202,00:29:51.206,We throw hand grenades...
00:29:52.207,00:29:54.918,We navigate imaginary minefields.
00:29:54.960,00:30:05.387,So let's dance We fire at nothing.
00:30:06.639,00:30:08.014,And we hydrate some more.
00:30:08.056,00:30:10.850,You will hydrate till I get full.
00:30:10.892,00:30:13.353,There you go.
00:30:13.395,00:30:15.021,Now hold 'em up.
00:30:18.776,00:30:20.193,Ow!
00:30:22.904,00:30:29.202,"And we look north towards the border, and we wait for them."
00:30:29.244,00:30:33.081,This is our labor.
00:30:33.123,00:30:36.042,"I got one, a white one."
00:30:37.043,00:30:41.173,Master race.
00:30:41.214,00:30:43.509,-Oh!
00:30:43.550,00:30:46.637,Chango's reign of terror is over.
00:30:48.472,00:30:50.390,Come on!
00:30:50.432,00:30:54.478,You fucking pussy!
00:30:54.520,00:30:57.897,"Come on, Chango."
00:31:00.484,00:31:02.944,"Now you're gonna see a fight, kids!"
00:31:02.944,00:31:05.238,Come on! Come on!
00:31:06.782,00:31:09.493,"Come on, Whitey."
00:31:10.494,00:31:12.037,"Come on, come on, come on, come on."
00:31:12.078,00:31:14.956,Come on! Come on!
00:31:17.710,00:31:20.295,"Pay me my money, motherfuckers!"
00:31:20.337,00:31:23.716,-All right!
00:31:23.757,00:31:26.385,I told you.
00:31:29.763,00:31:31.682,Chango!
00:31:32.474,00:31:34.976,Chango! Chango!
00:31:34.976,00:31:37.521,Chango! Chango!
00:31:37.563,00:31:38.980,Chango! Chango!
00:31:41.024,00:31:43.985,Chango! Chango!
00:31:43.985,00:31:46.988,Chango! Chango! Chango! Chango!
00:31:46.988,00:31:50.242,Chango! Chango!
00:31:50.283,00:31:53.620,Chango! Chango! Chango!
00:31:53.662,00:31:56.081,Fucking asshole.
00:32:23.024,00:32:26.027,Suggested techniques for the marine to use...
00:32:26.027,00:33:18.789,"in the avoidance of boredom and loneliness: masturbation, rereading of letters from unfaithful wives and girlfriends, cleaning your rifle, further masturbation, rewiring Walkmen, arguing about religion and meaning of life, discussing in detail every woman the marine has ever fucked, debating differences, such as Cuban versus Mexican, Harleys versus Hondas, left versus right-handed masturbation, further cleaning of rifle, studying of Filipino mail-order bride catalog, further masturbation, planning of marine's first meal on return home, imagining what the marine's girlfriend and her man Jody..."
00:33:18.831,00:33:21.082,are doing in the hay...
00:33:21.082,00:33:22.793,or in the alley...
00:33:24.085,00:33:26.254,or in a hotel bed.
00:33:32.093,00:33:33.929,-She up there yet?
00:33:33.971,00:33:36.306,-Get the fuck off me.
00:33:36.348,00:33:39.100,-She's gonna look beautiful up there.
00:33:45.357,00:33:47.484,I wonder what she's doing right now.
00:33:49.194,00:33:51.112,No way to know.
00:33:58.704,00:34:00.246,Now here are the rules.
00:34:00.288,00:34:02.248,"When you talk to these reporters, you do not get specific."
00:34:02.290,00:34:05.669,You tell them that there's no better shooters in the world than marine snipers.
00:34:05.711,00:34:10.131,"Tell 'em that you're happy to be here, you're proud of the mission, all right?"
00:34:10.131,00:34:12.718,And you can't wait to mash the fuck out of these Iraqis.
00:34:12.759,00:34:15.220,"Anything other than that comes out of your mouth, I get fucked up."
00:34:15.261,00:34:17.138,"And if I get fucked up, I'm gonna fuck you up."
00:34:17.138,00:34:19.307,"Take your shirts off, show your muscles."
00:34:19.349,00:34:22.143,-This is censorship.
00:34:22.143,00:34:25.146,Censorship. You're telling us what we can and can't say to the press.
00:34:25.146,00:34:28.859,-That's un-American.
00:34:28.901,00:34:31.820,"No, you signed a contract."
00:34:31.862,00:34:33.530,You got any complaints?
00:34:33.572,00:34:36.157,"You complain to Saddam Insane, and you see if he gives a fuck."
00:34:36.199,00:34:38.326,"Well, that's exactly what Saddam Hussein does."
00:34:38.368,00:34:40.161,You're treating us the same way.
00:34:40.161,00:34:42.497,You are a marine.
00:34:42.539,00:34:45.166,There's no such thing as speech that is free.
00:34:45.166,00:34:47.586,You must pay for everything that you say.
00:34:47.627,00:34:51.757,We're rolling.
00:34:51.798,00:34:54.300,You're a marine here in Saudi Arabia.
00:34:56.595,00:34:59.222,Are you glad to be here?
00:35:00.473,00:35:02.517,"Oh, yes, ma'am, I'm glad to be here."
00:35:02.559,00:35:08.648,"My, uh-- My uncle and my father served in Vietnam, so I'm proud to serve my country here."
00:35:08.690,00:35:13.695,"I have supreme confidence in all my leaders, you know, from my team leader to my president."
00:35:13.737,00:35:15.739,"I'm very proud to serve my country, yeah."
00:35:15.781,00:35:18.283,So who's waiting for you back home?
00:35:19.868,00:35:22.662,-Can I-- Can I give a message to my brother?
00:35:22.704,00:35:26.666,"-Tim, hey-- He's gonna get this?"
00:35:26.708,00:35:29.628,"Tim, what's up?"
00:35:29.669,00:35:33.381,And you are a maniac.
00:35:33.423,00:35:37.427,You're crazy.
00:35:33.423,00:35:39.930,"Uh, he'll understand. Uh-- You're a marine here in Saudi Arabia."
00:35:39.972,00:35:43.433,How do you hope the Kuwaitis will greet you?
00:35:49.439,00:35:51.608,How do you feel about the Iraqis?
00:35:51.650,00:35:54.235,They're the enemy.
00:35:51.650,00:35:55.737,Do you-- Do you-- Do you have nightmares about them?
00:35:55.779,00:36:02.452,"-How do you, uh-- I love it out here."
00:36:03.369,00:36:05.789,'Cause I count for something.
00:36:05.831,00:36:09.250,"Back home, I'd be working some nowhere job."
00:36:09.250,00:36:11.044,Nobody would even know I was alive.
00:36:13.338,00:36:15.799,We burn the fat off our souls.
00:36:17.258,00:36:19.594,"Hemingway, he said that."
00:36:19.636,00:36:21.888,Who's waiting for you back home?
00:36:21.930,00:36:29.270,"Uh-- Uh, well, you know, I have a girlfriend..."
00:36:29.270,00:36:31.481,waiting for me.
00:36:31.523,00:36:34.359,Anything you'd like to say to her?
00:36:35.276,00:36:41.616,"Um-- Uh, yeah, sure."
00:36:41.658,00:36:45.871,"Yeah, um-- Hi, Kristina."
00:36:47.288,00:36:48.874,Here we are.
00:36:53.461,00:36:56.297,Are you scared?
00:36:56.297,00:36:59.300,"Yes, ma'am, very happy to be here."
00:36:59.300,00:37:01.678,I love my country.
00:37:02.637,00:37:04.931,I miss my parents.
00:37:04.973,00:37:09.061,"Uh, they're treating me all right here."
00:37:09.102,00:37:22.115,"It was an opportunity for me to-- to defend America, the country which has given freedom to me and to my family, and, uh, it is an honor to-- to fight for that freedom."
00:37:22.157,00:37:25.326,To defend my country and to serve my country...
00:37:25.326,00:37:29.330,"and, uh, to learn skills to eventually go into law enforcement."
00:37:29.330,00:37:31.041,Are you scared?
00:37:32.667,00:37:40.341,"Look, I'm 20 years old, and I was dumb enough to sign a contract."
00:37:40.341,00:37:43.220,I can hear their fucking bombs already.
00:37:45.471,00:37:49.893,"I can hear their bombs, and I'm fucking scared, yeah."
00:37:52.938,00:37:55.356,"Don't tell my staff sergeant, though, all right?"
00:37:56.524,00:38:02.488,"So in case of a chemical attack, what provisions do you men have for that?"
00:38:02.530,00:38:05.366,This is what we call the N.B.C. suits.
00:38:05.366,00:38:08.411,"-That's nuclear, biological, chemical protective suits."
00:38:08.453,00:38:10.371,We also have a mask.
00:38:08.453,00:38:15.501,"It's the M17A1 mask, which is fitted with a drinking tube, so these guys can drink from their canteens without taking off their masks."
00:38:15.543,00:38:17.212,"-Oh, really."
00:38:17.254,00:38:20.381,but can I hold it?
00:38:20.381,00:38:23.176,"-Yeah, yeah, it is, but we need these..."
00:38:23.218,00:38:25.220,-in order to protect you.
00:38:25.262,00:38:28.807,"Yes, they do."
00:38:25.262,00:38:32.393,"They fight with it, and-- As a matter of fact, let me give you a small demonstration of that."
00:38:32.393,00:38:36.064,"-Kruger, Kruger, get rid of the ball."
00:38:36.106,00:38:39.985,Get rid of the ball.
00:38:40.026,00:38:42.403,-Fuck.
00:38:44.030,00:38:46.741,"All right, listen up, guys."
00:38:46.783,00:38:50.954,These reporters wanna see how your N.B.C. suits work.
00:38:50.996,00:38:53.498,"All right, so we're gonna continue this little football game..."
00:38:53.539,00:38:55.792,in full chemical gear.
00:38:55.834,00:38:58.419,-That's right.
00:38:58.419,00:39:00.046,It's 112 degrees.
00:39:00.088,00:39:02.423,"Then I guess you won't be needing your parkas, will you?"
00:39:02.465,00:39:05.177,-Let's play.
00:39:07.428,00:39:09.764,"I'm gonna hurt you, Swoff!"
00:39:09.806,00:39:13.059,I'm gonna hurt you so bad!
00:39:13.101,00:39:15.020,Hut!
00:39:15.061,00:39:16.437,Swoff!
00:39:16.479,00:39:19.440,Where's the fucking ball?
00:39:19.482,00:39:20.984,"Swofford, what is that?"
00:39:21.026,00:39:23.444,"Swofford, I guess you call that using your head, huh?"
00:39:23.444,00:39:25.613,He's using his head.
00:39:25.655,00:39:27.157,Hut!
00:39:32.996,00:39:34.706,"All right, hike!"
00:39:38.126,00:39:39.669,Hut!
00:39:50.471,00:39:54.726,Cortez!
00:40:03.693,00:40:05.570,"Yeah, baby!"
00:40:05.611,00:40:07.446,"Fuck you, bitch!"
00:40:10.700,00:40:12.244,Who got me?
00:40:12.285,00:40:14.996,-I want him.
00:40:15.038,00:40:17.456,"Yeah, yeah, I'll take the fucking midget."
00:40:17.498,00:40:20.459,"Oh, I'm the midget? Let's go, you squishy-faced retard."
00:40:20.501,00:40:23.462,Don't you ever call me squishy face.
00:40:23.504,00:40:26.465,Squishy face.
00:40:26.507,00:40:28.385,"-Let's go, squishy face."
00:40:35.225,00:40:38.519,"All right, that's it."
00:40:38.561,00:40:40.521,Put the masks back on.
00:40:40.563,00:40:42.565,We're gonna further this demonstration.
00:40:42.607,00:40:45.484,"Men, these M17A1 drinking tubes..."
00:40:45.526,00:40:48.487,are designed to work perfectly with your canteen and your mask.
00:40:48.529,00:40:51.366,Take the narrow part of the tube with your fingers extended and joined...
00:40:51.408,00:40:54.869,and place it into the appropriate receptacle on the canteen lid.
00:40:54.911,00:40:57.372,-The lid on my canteen's fucked.
00:40:57.414,00:41:00.499,-I got another one for you.
00:41:00.541,00:41:02.585,-We're gonna die of dehydration.
00:41:02.627,00:41:04.212,-Just cool it.
00:41:04.254,00:41:06.547,My drinking tube fell off at the gas chamber at Pendleton.
00:41:06.547,00:41:09.884,-It's been four months.
00:41:09.926,00:41:13.554,-Fucking piece of shit!
00:41:13.554,00:41:15.556,"Look out, look out."
00:41:26.109,00:41:28.736,Kruger of Arabia!
00:41:30.155,00:41:32.198,"-Kruger, field fuck."
00:41:32.240,00:41:34.326,"Field fuck, field fuck, field fuck."
00:41:34.367,00:41:36.577,Field fuck!
00:41:36.577,00:41:41.791,It's just good old American-- Shit.
00:41:41.833,00:41:43.335,-Stop it!
00:41:43.376,00:41:45.211,"Stop it, you assholes!"
00:41:45.253,00:41:48.631,-Put your clothes on!
00:41:48.673,00:41:53.886,"You wanna put your clothes on and quit acting like monkeys, you stupid motherfuckers?"
00:41:53.928,00:41:55.596,"Put your clothes on, assholes."
00:41:55.596,00:41:58.183,"Yeah, come on."
00:41:58.224,00:42:01.686,"Uh, yeah, let's go check out the artillery and everything."
00:42:01.727,00:42:03.688,Field what?
00:42:03.729,00:42:05.731,That's one of the exercises that's we run here...
00:42:05.773,00:42:06.816,when we're in the field.
00:42:15.616,00:42:18.870,The armory.
00:42:33.051,00:42:35.636,"Come back soon now, ya hear? Whoo!"
00:42:48.691,00:42:50.902,I don't hear you laughing now.
00:42:55.448,00:42:57.658,I can't-- I can't hear you.
00:43:02.663,00:43:04.499,"Oh, that's better."
00:43:04.541,00:43:06.042,Sounds jovial.
00:43:07.335,00:43:09.379,"Platoon, Atten-hut!"
00:43:12.424,00:43:15.218,-Lance Corporal Swofford.
00:43:15.260,00:43:18.096,"-On top of the world, huh?"
00:43:18.137,00:43:24.685,"Well, I have more important things to do, like, uh, play with my balls."
00:43:24.685,00:43:26.104,But guess what.
00:43:26.145,00:43:31.734,"for a little two-day vacation back in the rear, so I suggest you get your shit together."
00:43:31.776,00:43:35.321,You could start by taking all that down.
00:43:35.363,00:43:37.698,"Yeah, whatever."
00:43:44.705,00:43:46.707,"Come on, Swoff."
00:43:46.707,00:43:48.709,"Your mommy again, Fergie."
00:43:48.709,00:43:51.129,-What are you listening to?
00:43:51.170,00:43:53.298,You're a retard.
00:43:53.339,00:43:58.970,"Fergus, you and your mom got fire watch tonight, -2200 to 0200."
00:43:59.011,00:44:01.139,Why does it have to be me?
00:44:01.180,00:44:03.849,'Cause you're so boot.
00:44:05.893,00:44:07.979,"That's the third fucking time, man."
00:44:08.020,00:44:10.731,-What's that?
00:44:10.731,00:44:12.317,Is that so fucking hard?
00:44:12.358,00:44:14.819,What difference does it make? God knows you're no preference.
00:44:14.860,00:44:17.113,At least they got the blood type right.
00:44:17.155,00:44:20.825,"I mean, which would you rather get, the wrong prayer or the wrong blood?"
00:44:20.866,00:44:24.745,One lonely pink letter from Sacramento.
00:44:24.745,00:44:27.499,Kristina.
00:44:27.540,00:44:29.417,I wonder what she's up to.
00:44:31.752,00:44:33.588,Go jerk off outside.

00:44:51.772,00:44:53.774,"-This baby's a gringo, man."
00:44:53.816,00:44:55.776,No way.
00:44:57.570,00:44:59.656,As long as he's not a Cuban with a little dick.
00:44:59.780,00:45:01.991,"Cortez, can I see him?"
00:45:02.033,00:45:03.660,"There you go, Pinko."
00:45:08.456,00:45:10.667,"He's beautiful, man."
00:45:13.878,00:45:15.796,-I'm gonna put my little boy up.
00:45:15.796,00:45:18.550,-Doesn't look good.

00:45:50.831,00:45:52.833,Grabs on to the pole and goes...
00:45:52.833,00:45:55.503,"Jody, Jody! Six-foot-four!"

00:59:09.629,00:59:11.631,Stick that back in there.
00:59:11.631,00:59:14.051,"It's already full of diesel fuel, sir."
00:59:16.303,00:59:18.638,I don't care if it's full of Chanel No. 5.
00:59:18.638,00:59:21.975,I'm not going to the other side of this camp for my morning glory.
00:59:22.976,00:59:25.521,Stick that fucker back in there.

01:00:54.109,01:00:55.777,I already told you.
01:00:55.819,01:00:57.946,An accident? Right.
01:00:57.988,01:00:59.615,Like when this trigger slips.
01:01:01.032,01:01:03.743,Of course your nice little mom and dad are where?
01:01:03.785,01:01:05.745,-Cottonwood Falls.
01:01:05.745,01:01:08.290,They'll be sad.
01:01:08.332,01:01:10.292,I'll say it was an accidental discharge.
01:01:10.334,01:01:13.753,"I might even spend some time in the brig, but I'll end this fucking waiting."
01:01:15.088,01:01:17.757,And I'll know what it's like to kill a man.
01:01:18.967,01:01:21.761,What are you doing?
01:01:21.761,01:01:24.055,I'm in the firing position known as the sitting position.
01:01:24.097,01:01:26.517,"After the prone position, it's the platform most likely..."

01:01:28.768,01:01:32.063,"Generally an enemy, but sometimes a friend, or a friendly."
01:01:32.105,01:01:34.774,"We call this friendly fire, or getting friendly fucked."
01:01:34.774,01:01:36.901,"Come on, Swoff."
01:01:36.943,01:01:40.030,"It was Christmas Eve, and I was just sitting there thinking about home."
01:01:40.071,01:01:43.492,"What do you think, Cortez?"
01:01:43.534,01:01:45.994,"-Sure, you'll kill him."
01:01:46.036,01:01:49.206,"No, I don't see shit."
01:01:49.247,01:01:52.125,"As a matter of fact, I ain't even here, Swoff."
01:01:54.294,01:01:56.796,"Shh, shh, shh."
01:02:03.845,01:02:05.514,"What are you doing, man?"
01:02:07.349,01:02:09.351,The M16A2 service rifle is a lightweight...
01:02:09.393,01:02:12.020,"air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed shoulder weapon."

01:08:07.166,01:08:10.003,"Eight men, five camels."
01:08:16.718,01:08:18.720,Swoff spoke Arabic.
01:08:18.762,01:08:21.180,Sounded like a duck fucking or something...
01:08:21.180,01:08:22.640,-but he spoke Arabic.
01:08:22.682,01:08:25.184,"Yeah, yeah, well, at least we finally saw something."
01:08:25.184,01:08:29.188,"You guys should see what a .40 does to the head of a fucking camel, though. Whoo!"
01:08:29.188,01:08:32.692,"What does a .40 do to the head of a camel, Fowler?"
01:08:32.734,01:08:35.486,Turns the head inside out about three fucking knots.
01:08:35.528,01:08:37.405,Head shot's like a motherfucker too.
01:08:37.447,01:08:39.407,"It's easy shots, slow."

01:09:14.067,01:09:16.319,-You truly are an asshole.
01:09:16.360,01:09:19.238,You just haven't got to kill anything yet.

01:09:21.825,01:09:24.953,"Your day will come, man."
01:09:32.293,01:09:34.253,Listen up.
01:09:34.253,01:09:37.465,what Mr. Saddam Hussein has just said to the Iraqi people.
01:09:37.507,01:09:40.259,And you better not consider this a bunch of bullshit.
01:09:41.260,01:09:43.387,The mother of all battles is upon us.
01:09:43.429,01:09:46.265,-The sacrifices the Iraqi people will make...
01:09:46.265,01:09:47.892,are equal to the importance of the victory.
01:09:47.934,01:09:51.980,Kuwait is the branch that must be returned to the tree.
01:09:52.022,01:09:54.816,The blood of the infidels will flow like a river.
01:09:54.858,01:09:57.485,Jihad is the way of all Arab people.
01:09:57.527,01:10:04.784,"We are now Operation Desert Storm, and we are the fucking righteous hammer of God, and that hammer is coming down."
01:10:04.826,01:10:08.245,It's real now!
01:10:08.287,01:10:10.498,Oorah!

01:10:41.237,01:10:44.281,Let's move.
01:10:44.323,01:10:49.829,"When we cross this berm tomorrow, we expect as many as 30,000 casualties the first day."
01:10:49.871,01:10:54.209,There will be gas.
01:10:54.250,01:10:57.628,These atropine-oxime injectors go along with your P.B. pill packs.
01:10:57.670,01:10:59.964,In the event that you are attacked by a nerve agent...
01:11:00.006,01:11:03.885,"such as Soman, these agents will produce casualties immediately..."
01:11:03.927,01:11:07.346,if you do not deploy these countermeasures fucking ricky-tick.
01:11:07.346,01:11:12.351,"Why in the fuck if we've already taken a set of P.B. pills, are just now being issued the fucking injector?"
01:11:12.351,01:11:14.645,-Shut the fuck up.
01:11:14.687,01:11:16.189,"All right, man, calm down."
01:11:16.231,01:11:18.399,"Look, they don't want chemically dead fighters on CNN."
01:11:18.441,01:11:19.567,"Just sign it, Kruger."
01:11:19.609,01:11:21.402,-What the fuck is this?
01:11:21.444,01:11:24.739,Says these pills aren't proven.
01:11:24.781,01:11:27.658,"Oh, okay."
01:11:27.700,01:11:31.537,"I'll take the fucking pills, and a year later, my asshole will turn inside out..."
01:11:31.579,01:11:33.372,-and start fucking talking to me!
01:11:36.375,01:11:38.836,"Kruger, you country motherfucker."
01:11:38.878,01:11:44.634,"In 1987, Saddam Insane used chemical weapons against the Kurds, and he killed thousands like fucking that."
01:11:44.675,01:11:54.685,"The ones that lived-- Their kids came out fucked up, eight toes to one foot, no anal openings, retarded, blind, such fucked-up little motherfuckers, they should have just killed them all anyway."
01:11:54.727,01:11:56.896,"You want that, don't take the pills."
01:11:56.938,01:11:59.398,"You don't want that, sign the fucking waivers..."
01:11:59.398,01:12:01.818,and take the fucking pills!
01:12:02.986,01:12:05.404,"All of you, get your pills in your hands."
01:12:05.404,01:12:08.699,Get 'em out.
01:12:11.953,01:12:13.997,Now take the pill and put it on your tongue.
01:12:16.916,01:12:19.418,Swallow the pill.
01:12:19.418,01:12:21.462,Now let me see your tongues.
01:12:24.757,01:12:26.676,"Now, doesn't that feel better?"
01:12:26.717,01:12:28.636,Don't we all feel better?
01:12:28.678,01:12:30.680,"-Yes, Staff Sergeant!"
01:12:30.721,01:12:32.974,Now dig your sleeping holes.
01:12:33.016,01:12:36.227,Dig your holes with the hands God gave you.
01:12:46.070,01:12:50.908,Fucking zoomies.
01:12:50.950,01:12:53.536,Are they gonna win the war all by themselves?
01:12:53.577,01:12:55.746,They'll be sleeping in their own beds tonight too.
01:12:55.788,01:12:58.666,"So what, man?"
01:12:58.708,01:13:01.002,"When the shit hits the fan, we lead the fucking way!"
01:13:01.044,01:13:02.753,Oorah!
01:13:02.795,01:13:05.548,Sure. Look around.
01:13:05.589,01:13:08.759,"This war's gonna move too fast for us, all right?"
01:13:08.801,01:13:10.720,We can shoot a thousand yards.
01:13:10.761,01:13:12.763,To go that far in Vietnam...
01:13:12.805,01:13:14.724,"it would take a week, in World War I, a year."
01:13:14.765,01:13:17.852,"Here, it's gonna take about 10 fucking seconds."
01:13:17.894,01:13:22.148,"By the time we have our rifles dialed, the war's gonna be a mile down the road."
01:13:22.190,01:13:24.150,Wake up!
01:13:26.485,01:13:28.238,Jesus.
01:13:30.865,01:13:33.326,What the fuck is going on?
01:13:33.368,01:13:35.286,Get out of my sleeping hole.
01:13:35.328,01:13:38.373,"We're about to go in the shit, and you're fucking with their heads."
01:13:38.497,01:13:39.957,Get out of my sleeping hole.
01:13:39.999,01:13:42.168,Lucky day. Listen up.
01:13:42.210,01:13:44.212,"We leave tomorrow, 0900."
01:13:44.254,01:13:46.297,"Swofford, you gotta sign your waiver again."
01:13:46.339,01:13:49.217,-I can't read your fucking handwriting.
01:14:01.229,01:14:03.522,-Done.
01:14:03.564,01:14:04.982,I could read it the first time.
01:14:06.067,01:14:08.069,Your boy Troy got turned down for reenlistment.
01:14:09.237,01:14:11.530,What?
01:14:11.530,01:14:13.532,"Hey, hey, watch your mouth."
01:14:13.574,01:14:15.534,But that's all he-- That's all he wants...
01:14:15.534,01:14:16.994,-is to be in the suck.
01:14:17.036,01:14:19.580,But the suck doesn't want him.
01:14:19.622,01:14:22.750,He had a criminal record.
01:14:22.792,01:14:24.919,And he lied about it on his application.
01:14:24.961,01:14:27.755,"So when we get back home, he's out."
01:14:27.797,01:14:29.715,He's out. The reason I'm telling you is...
01:14:29.757,01:14:31.634,so you can keep him from fucking up.
01:14:31.675,01:14:33.344,You think you can manage that?
01:14:34.762,01:14:36.764,Can you manage that?
01:14:48.609,01:14:50.694,Fuck.
01:15:12.591,01:15:13.759,What?
01:15:13.801,01:15:16.887,"So you weren't even gonna tell me, huh?"
01:15:16.929,01:15:18.973,What?
01:15:22.852,01:15:24.603,Why don't you just shut the fuck up...
01:15:24.603,01:15:25.938,and mind your own business?
01:15:43.998,01:15:47.084,"-What the fuck is this, man?"
01:15:49.128,01:15:51.172,"She sent it back, man."
01:15:49.128,01:15:53.674,Sent it back -like you send back a ring.
01:15:53.716,01:15:55.385,I'll always love you.
01:15:55.426,01:15:57.636,"Well, what's the fucking problem then?"
01:15:57.636,01:15:59.930,"Nothing stays the same, Swoff."
01:15:59.972,01:16:02.641,"Not our girlfriends, not our families, not anyone."
01:16:02.641,01:16:05.769,Time doesn't stop back in the real world 'cause we're about to go in the shit.
01:16:05.811,01:16:08.814,We're marines.
01:16:08.856,01:16:11.817,"No, we're jarheads."
01:16:11.859,01:16:13.652,"Yeah, how the fuck do you know?"
01:16:13.652,01:16:17.656,"I know you're a fucking jarhead, and that's all I need to know, jar-fucking-head."
01:16:17.698,01:16:19.992,"Hey, jarhead, what's the Marine Corps birthday?"
01:16:20.034,01:16:23.079,-Marine Corps birthday?
01:16:23.120,01:16:25.664,-Older than the U.S.A.

01:16:36.926,01:16:39.762,-Greatest weapon on earth?
01:16:39.803,01:16:41.764,You wanna win your fucking war?
01:16:41.805,01:16:43.682,You tell it to the marines!
01:16:43.724,01:16:46.477,Get the brand!

01:17:09.208,01:17:12.002,"You earned it, man."
01:17:27.184,01:17:29.728,We turned the inside of our tent...
01:17:29.770,01:17:32.523,into a circus...
01:17:34.191,01:17:38.321,"'cause inside of our circus, we cannot be injured."
01:17:39.863,01:17:43.075,"Inside of our circus, we cannot be touched."
01:17:44.785,01:17:48.747,But we are insane...
01:17:48.747,01:17:49.915,to believe this.

01:29:48.466,01:29:51.803,"-Thanks, man."
01:29:51.845,01:29:55.349,The wind's changed!
01:29:55.473,01:29:57.851,I came here to fight.
01:29:57.893,01:30:00.729,I just got to get out of this fucking oil!
01:30:00.770,01:30:02.939,"Let's go, man."
01:30:26.838,01:30:30.050,"That's Vietnam music, man."
01:30:33.220,01:30:36.265,"Hey, Kru."
01:30:36.306,01:30:38.934,What's Fowler doing digging way over there?
01:30:38.975,01:30:41.895,He ain't digging.
01:30:41.937,01:30:44.480,"Fowler, what are you doing?"
01:30:44.522,01:30:47.401,Fowler!
01:30:47.441,01:30:49.236,What are you digging over there?
01:30:49.278,01:30:51.487,Nothing.
01:30:51.529,01:30:53.489,Our orders are to dig over here.
01:30:53.531,01:30:55.909,Mind your own fucking business.
01:31:01.664,01:31:04.834,"Hey, Fowler!"
01:31:08.755,01:31:10.757,"Hey, Fergie, come here."
01:31:10.799,01:31:13.760,I got to show you something.
01:31:13.802,01:31:16.554,"This is my new best buddy, man."
01:31:17.555,01:31:20.309,-Who's under there?
01:31:20.350,01:31:22.560,Ta-da!
01:31:22.560,01:31:25.230,"Jesus Christ, Fowler."
01:31:25.272,01:31:29.067,"Ahab the A-rab, huh?"
01:31:29.109,01:31:31.861,"-Hey, get that out of here."
01:31:31.903,01:31:35.782,"-Five bucks gets your picture taken with it, guys."
01:31:35.824,01:31:38.952,Check out what I put in his mouth.
01:31:40.454,01:31:43.581,"What's the matter, Swoffie?"
01:31:43.581,01:31:46.293,You don't like Ahab?
01:31:46.335,01:31:49.754,This is war!
01:31:49.796,01:31:52.590,Don't you fucking touch me!
01:31:52.590,01:31:55.302,"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
01:31:57.262,01:31:59.597,The whole goddamn desert is shitting dead ragheads.
01:31:59.597,01:32:03.601,Have we done anything?
01:32:03.601,01:32:05.770,I didn't kill him!
01:32:07.063,01:32:08.606,Move.
01:32:08.606,01:32:12.652,Fuck you.
01:32:15.613,01:32:19.617,"There's tons of crispy critters around here, man. I'll get as many as I want."
01:32:19.617,01:32:21.370,You won't get this one.
01:32:21.411,01:32:25.165,"Yeah, but I'll get as many as I want, man!"
01:32:25.207,01:32:28.084,'Cause I don't even fucking want that one!
01:32:28.126,01:32:30.628,I don't.
01:32:30.628,01:32:32.464,Fowler.
01:32:33.631,01:32:35.633,Stay sharp.
01:33:16.674,01:33:18.676,It's all right.
01:33:18.676,01:33:20.803,You're gonna be all right.
01:33:20.845,01:33:22.556,It's all right.
01:33:23.681,01:33:25.975,Whoa.
01:33:30.772,01:33:33.567,You're covered in this fucking oil.
01:34:03.597,01:34:07.350,"The army may pull this type of shit, but the marines don't."
01:34:07.392,01:34:10.520,"When we get back, Fowler will be passing out shit paper."
01:34:30.206,01:34:32.626,I could be working with my brother right now.
01:34:33.876,01:34:38.214,"He's got a, uh, drywall business in Compton."
01:34:39.757,01:34:44.762,"Does the inside of office buildings, you know, the metal studs."
01:34:44.762,01:34:46.181,I could be his partner.
01:34:46.222,01:34:50.768,He said he'd give me that brand new Dodge Ramcharger.
01:34:50.810,01:34:53.271,"You know, the 318 Magnum, the Beast?"
01:34:54.814,01:34:57.900,"All indoor work too, lots of A.C."
01:34:57.942,01:35:00.487,I could sleep with my wife every night.
01:35:00.529,01:35:02.780,"Fuck her, maybe."
01:35:02.822,01:35:05.283,Take my kids to school every morning.
01:35:05.325,01:35:08.786,"And I'd run his crews too, probably increase productivity 40% to 50%."
01:35:08.786,01:35:12.040,Make 100K a year.
01:35:12.790,01:35:14.209,Do you know why I don't?
01:35:19.797,01:35:24.219,Because I love this job.
01:35:28.806,01:35:32.810,I thank God for every fucking day that he gives me in the Corps.
01:35:32.810,01:35:34.812,Oorah.
01:35:40.569,01:35:43.863,"I mean, who else gets the chance to see shit like this?"
01:35:59.254,01:36:04.050,-Know what I'm saying?
01:36:05.552,01:36:06.844,Do you?
01:36:19.857,01:36:21.859,"Hey, listen up."
01:36:21.859,01:36:23.861,The colonel says he wants my best snipers.
01:36:23.861,01:36:25.988,"God help me, it's you two."
01:36:26.030,01:36:28.283,We've had beaucoup surrenders.
01:36:28.324,01:36:32.203,"But the Republican Guard is still out there, and they are most definitely hard-core."
01:36:32.245,01:36:34.872,So you keep your shit together.
01:36:36.374,01:36:38.876,"Yes, Staff Sergeant."
01:36:38.876,01:36:40.670,"-Thank you, Staff Sergeant."
01:36:40.712,01:36:44.173,-Thank you.
01:36:44.215,01:36:45.759,Let's go!
01:36:53.891,01:36:55.685,Fuckin'-A!
01:36:55.727,01:36:59.522,"Get a kill, you fucking pussies!"
01:37:24.088,01:37:27.550,you boys are good.
01:37:27.592,01:37:29.927,"Well, if it comes from him, it's not bullshit."
01:37:29.927,01:37:34.182,I got the kind of mission scout/snipers would pop their grandmother to get.
01:37:34.223,01:37:37.435,We got 750 Republican Guards dug in...
01:37:37.477,01:37:41.648,around a control tower at Airfield Al Jaber.
01:37:41.690,01:37:44.942,Grid 703003.
01:37:44.942,01:37:49.781,The recon reports two high-ranking officers in the tower.
01:37:49.823,01:37:52.116,All my air is tied up farther north till 1800.
01:37:52.158,01:37:57.497,"So if you can take out those officers, maybe the cannon fodder'll white flag it..."
01:37:57.539,01:37:59.957,and can save me having to take the whole battalion...
01:37:59.957,01:38:01.501,hey-diddle-diddle- right-up-the-middle.
01:38:01.543,01:38:05.296,"-Aye-aye, sir."
01:38:05.338,01:38:07.632,"Before you take a shot, you must get clearance."
01:38:07.674,01:38:09.718,-Understood?
01:38:09.759,01:38:11.969,Outstanding.
01:38:11.969,01:38:17.058,Some of my officers think that scout/snipers are prima donnas.
01:38:17.099,01:38:20.269,They think STA stands for Sun Tan Association.
01:38:20.311,01:38:22.647,-Are they right?
01:38:22.689,01:38:25.024,Then fucking show me.
01:39:10.027,01:39:12.029,Clear.
01:39:23.332,01:39:25.293,"Oh, shit."
01:39:25.334,01:39:28.421,There's no one in the tower.
01:39:30.381,01:39:33.050,The sun's going down. Shit.
01:39:33.050,01:39:34.719,Wait.
01:39:36.220,01:39:38.306,"Thank you, Jesus."
01:39:44.771,01:39:47.231,Romeo-Golf-Charlie.
01:39:47.273,01:39:49.567,This is Lima-Two-Sierra.
01:39:49.609,01:39:52.069,Officers in control tower. Over.
01:39:52.111,01:39:54.196,"That's what they look like, huh?"
01:39:57.074,01:39:59.535,Range.
