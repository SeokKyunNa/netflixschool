00:00:25.859,00:00:27.110,And logos.

00:00:40.123,00:00:41.791,DC.
00:00:42.167,00:00:44.669,The house that Batman built.
00:00:45.545,00:00:47.797,"Yeah, what, Superman?"
00:00:47.964,00:00:49.966,"Come at me, bro."
00:00:50.133,00:00:52.010,I'm your Kryptonite.
00:00:58.641,00:00:59.642,Hmm.
00:00:59.809,00:01:03.313,"Not sure what RatPac does, but that logo is macho."
00:01:04.647,00:01:06.024,I dig it.
00:01:06.816,00:01:07.984,Okay.
00:01:08.151,00:01:11.988,Get yourself ready for some reading.
00:01:12.989,00:01:18.453,If you want to make the world a better place take a look at yourself and make a change.
00:01:19.079,00:01:20.080,Hooo.
00:01:21.247,00:01:22.832,No. I said that.
00:01:23.708,00:01:25.668,Batman is very wise.
00:01:25.835,00:01:28.213,I also have huge pecs and a nine-pack.
00:01:30.465,00:01:31.883,"Yeah, I've got an extra ab."
00:01:32.509,00:01:34.010,"Now, let's start the movie."
00:01:48.316,00:01:57.117,"We are transporting 11 million sticks of dynamite, 17,000 pounds of C-4, about 150 cute little classic bomb-type bombs, and two best friends!"
00:01:57.534,00:02:01.204,And request permission to fly over the most crime-ridden city in the world.
00:02:01.371,00:02:02.372,Over.
00:02:02.539,00:02:04.624,I'm just looking at all the guys' faces here in the control tower.
00:02:04.791,00:02:05.792,-I'm good. -Sounds good to me.
00:02:05.959,00:02:07.085,"-Do it! -Yeah, as long as they're best friends."
00:02:07.252,00:02:09.129,"-Thumbs up! -Yep, I think we're cool with that."
00:02:31.693,00:02:35.989,"seal breach in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!"
00:02:37.991,00:02:38.992,What was that?
00:02:39.159,00:02:40.535,-One of us should check it out. -Okay.
00:02:42.162,00:02:43.204,-Paper. -Scissors.
00:02:43.371,00:02:44.414,Ha! You always do paper.
00:02:44.581,00:02:46.916,I'm a loser at home and a loser at work.
00:02:49.502,00:02:50.503,Holy cow!
00:02:55.174,00:02:57.093,"Captain Dale, is everything okay?"
00:03:01.097,00:03:02.849,I'm your new co-pilot.
00:03:03.182,00:03:07.186,And I always come to work with a smile!
00:03:12.108,00:03:14.027,-You should be terrified. -Why?
00:03:14.193,00:03:17.113,Because I will be taking over the city.
00:03:17.322,00:03:18.364,Mmm...
00:03:18.573,00:03:20.450,-What? -Batman will stop you.
00:03:22.076,00:03:23.077,"No, he doesn't."
00:03:23.244,00:03:24.913,What about that time with the two boats?
00:03:25.079,00:03:26.789,This is better than the two boats.
00:03:26.998,00:03:30.752,"-Mmm... -Well, tonight is gonna be different!"
00:03:31.252,00:03:33.963,Tonight is my greatest plan yet.
00:03:34.130,00:03:36.799,"And trust me, Batman's never gonna see it coming."
00:03:40.637,00:03:42.222,"-Good night, Steve. -Take it easy, Jeff."
00:03:43.514,00:03:45.099,"Man, I really like that guy."
00:03:45.266,00:03:47.310,I sure hope nothing bad happens to him.
00:03:52.815,00:03:53.816,What the...
00:03:55.652,00:03:58.071,by Gotham's greatest criminal minds.
00:03:58.238,00:04:03.493,Including Scarecrow.

00:04:46.703,00:04:48.162,"Nope, they're all real."
00:04:48.329,00:04:49.706,Probably worth a Google.
00:04:52.083,00:04:53.835,"-Hey, watch it! -Commissioner Gordon!"
00:04:54.002,00:04:55.003,"What is it, O'Hara?"
00:04:55.169,00:04:56.170,We just got a report!
00:04:56.337,00:04:58.715,All the Z-grade villains have broken into the energy plant!
00:04:58.881,00:04:59.882,"What are we gonna do, sir?"
00:05:00.049,00:05:02.385,The only thing we ever do. Flip the switch to the Bat-Signal!
00:05:02.635,00:05:03.636,Flip!
00:05:05.221,00:05:06.889,"The Bat-Signal, she's been egged!"
00:05:09.058,00:05:10.601,I'm well aware of his work.
00:05:10.768,00:05:12.895,Dear gosh. You've destroyed the Bat-Signal.
00:05:13.062,00:05:14.647,You have thought of everything.
00:05:14.814,00:05:16.274,"Yeah, I know!"
00:05:16.441,00:05:17.859,And when I take over Gotham City...

00:05:25.533,00:05:27.618,Me! The Joker!
00:05:29.704,00:05:31.122,"Joker, do you read me?"
00:05:31.289,00:05:32.415,"10-4, girl buddy."
00:05:32.582,00:05:33.916,"We're ready for you, sugar plum."
00:05:34.083,00:05:36.419,"Well, then, let's raise the roof!"
00:05:46.721,00:05:48.139,"O'Hara, have you tried the Bat-Phone?"
00:05:48.306,00:05:50.641,"Yes, but all I'm getting is this hold music."
00:05:52.602,00:05:53.603,I love it.
00:05:56.939,00:05:58.775,-I want snipers trained on that building! -You bet!
00:05:58.941,00:06:01.069,"-I want water and air support, yesterday! -Ahoy, sir!"
00:06:01.235,00:06:02.612,And I need SWAT here now!
00:06:03.946,00:06:04.947,Hello? Batman?
00:06:05.114,00:06:07.700,"Hi, Jimmy! It's the Jokes. Oop!"

00:06:22.048,00:06:29.597,"If the mayor isn't here in five minutes to negotiate the city's surrender, then I shall destroy Gotham City."
00:06:29.764,00:06:31.182,I did something!
00:06:34.102,00:06:35.103,Talk us through it.
00:06:35.394,00:06:44.320,"Well, I don't wanna scare any small children who may be listening, but it's a little-known fact that Gotham City is built on a bunch of flimsy plates stuck together."
00:06:44.487,00:06:50.159,"There's literally nothing beneath us, except an infinite abyss that smells like dirty underwear."
00:06:50.326,00:06:58.835,"If Joker's bomb were to go off, these plates would break apart, plunging every Gotham citizen into the eternal abyss forever."
00:07:00.837,00:07:03.589,Now get me the mayor! Joker out!
00:07:03.756,00:07:06.467,"Madam Mayor, I cannot ask you to do this!"
00:07:06.634,00:07:09.178,"-Jim, did you find Batman? -No, ma'am."
00:07:09.345,00:07:10.847,Then we have no choice.
00:07:11.013,00:07:15.351,The Joker has the upper hand. We have to surrender Gotham City.
00:07:16.978,00:07:18.729,I'm sorry!

00:07:42.920,00:07:44.630,"Well, let me give you a word of advice."
00:07:44.797,00:07:45.798,I'm all ears.

00:11:04.330,00:11:06.582,I am fighting a few different people.
00:11:06.749,00:11:07.750,What?
00:11:07.917,00:11:08.918,I like to fight around.

00:11:39.448,00:11:42.701,Batman and Joker are not a thing.
00:11:43.786,00:11:45.413,I don't need you.
00:11:46.372,00:11:48.290,I don't need anyone.
00:11:50.000,00:11:52.962,You mean nothing to me.

00:13:05.034,00:13:06.035,Computer.
00:13:09.246,00:13:12.458,Great. Let's turn those frowns upside down.
00:13:16.504,00:13:17.755,That sounds like the Batmobile.
00:13:20.508,00:13:21.550,No way!
00:13:22.134,00:13:23.385,"Hey, orphans! Look who's here!"
00:13:25.387,00:13:28.224,"Hey, kids. Who wants a shot from the merch gun?"
00:13:30.351,00:13:32.186,-Kaboom! -I got a lunchbox!
00:13:32.353,00:13:34.480,-Kaboom! -I got a sippy cup!
00:13:34.647,00:13:36.899,-Kaboom! -I got a Batarang!
00:13:37.066,00:13:38.734,And the rest of you get Bat Bucks.
00:13:40.402,00:13:44.073,"Remember, kids, if you want to be like Batman, take care of your abs. Batman out!"
00:13:53.999,00:13:55.918,"Thanks, Batman. You're my hero!"
00:14:00.756,00:14:01.757,Whoo!
00:14:19.316,00:14:20.776,Iron Man sucks.
00:14:20.943,00:14:22.027,Thank you.
00:14:23.279,00:14:25.948,It must be great to be Batman.
00:14:26.115,00:14:33.789,"I can only imagine he is going home right now to party the night away, surrounded by scores of friends and lady tennis players."
00:14:43.090,00:14:44.592,"Hey, Computer."
00:14:45.134,00:14:46.135,I'm home.
00:14:51.849,00:14:54.685,Initializing Batcave operating system.
00:14:57.104,00:14:58.105,"Hey, 'Puter."
00:14:59.481,00:15:01.483,"What's up, Batman?"
00:15:02.610,00:15:04.236,Put this bomb in the museum.
00:15:04.403,00:15:05.404,"Certainly, sir."
00:15:06.530,00:15:08.115,-Thank you. -No worries.
00:15:08.866,00:15:10.826,Anything exciting happen when I was gone?
00:15:10.993,00:15:12.369,You have four pieces of mail.
00:15:12.536,00:15:13.871,"Great, what'd I get?"
00:15:14.038,00:15:19.001,"You have this week's Pennysaver, two bills, and a coupon for Bed Bath and Beyond."
00:15:19.168,00:15:21.045,It expires in two weeks.
00:15:21.211,00:15:24.340,But I've heard that some stores will honor them past the expiry date.
00:15:24.506,00:15:25.507,Copy that.
00:15:25.674,00:15:31.263,"Also, Alfred is on the 17th floor, grouting tiles in the second bathroom of the fifth master bedroom."
00:15:32.139,00:15:34.058,Do you want me to tell Alfred you're home?
00:15:34.224,00:15:36.977,"No, that's cool, Computer. Thanks for the update."
00:15:37.144,00:15:38.854,I should probably have some dinner.
00:15:39.021,00:15:41.357,Alfred left your lobster thermidor in the fridge.
00:15:41.523,00:15:42.524,"Oh, that's my favorite."
00:15:43.108,00:15:44.860,I can't wait.
00:16:02.711,00:16:06.048,"Oh, not 20 minutes. Stupid."
00:17:14.575,00:17:16.118,"Oh, wait."
00:17:16.285,00:17:18.662,"There, which one is, uh..."
00:17:19.621,00:17:20.622,Okay.
00:17:38.265,00:17:39.433,Love it!
00:18:18.013,00:18:19.306,"Hey, Mom."
00:18:20.349,00:18:21.809,"Hey, Dad."
00:18:23.227,00:18:24.311,"I, uh..."
00:18:24.728,00:18:26.688,I saved the city again today.
00:18:30.526,00:18:32.277,I wish you could have seen me.
00:18:34.029,00:18:36.323,I think you would have been really proud.
00:18:41.703,00:18:44.373,Oh! Alfred! I am so sorry.
00:18:44.540,00:18:45.958,I have incredible reflexes.
00:18:46.125,00:18:47.543,"No, it's all my fault, sir."
00:18:47.709,00:18:49.795,I should have known better than to sneak up on you like that.
00:18:49.962,00:18:54.299,"Sorry, I was just lost in thought, and as you know, when I'm in there, I'm in deep."
00:18:54.466,00:18:56.760,Were you looking at the old family pictures again?
00:18:57.302,00:18:59.555,At the what? The old family...
00:18:59.721,00:19:01.723,"Oh, yes! I see what you mean."
00:19:01.890,00:19:04.268,Look at that! The old gang.
00:19:04.434,00:19:06.395,"Yeah. No, I wasn't."
00:19:07.563,00:19:08.897,I see.
00:19:09.064,00:19:12.442,"Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I'm a little concerned."
00:19:12.609,00:19:25.038,I've seen you go through similar phases in 2016 and 2012 and 2008 and 2005 and 1997 and 1995 and 1992 and 1989 and that weird one in 1966.
00:19:25.205,00:19:28.000,Do you want to talk about how you're feeling right now?
00:19:28.167,00:19:30.252,"I don't talk about feelings, Alfred."
00:19:30.419,00:19:32.004,"I don't have any, I've never seen one."
00:19:32.171,00:19:36.800,"I'm a night-stalking, crime-fighting vigilante, and a heavy metal rapping machine."
00:19:36.967,00:19:40.012,"I don't feel anything emotionally, except for rage."
00:19:40.179,00:19:43.932,"24/7, 365, at a million percent."
00:19:44.099,00:19:46.643,"And if you think that there's something behind that, then you're crazy."
00:19:46.810,00:19:47.811,"Good night, Alfred."
00:19:47.978,00:19:49.188,"Sir, it's morning."
00:19:51.940,00:19:55.944,"Master Bruce, you live on an island, figuratively and literally."
00:19:57.529,00:20:02.951,"You can't spend the rest of your life alone, dressed in black, listening to angry music, and staying up all night."
00:20:03.118,00:20:05.621,"Yes, I can, 'cause I'm Batman."
00:20:05.787,00:20:12.044,But don't you think it's time you finally faced your greatest fear?
00:20:12.211,00:20:13.212,-Snakes? -No.
00:20:13.378,00:20:14.379,-Clowns? -No.
00:20:14.546,00:20:15.631,Snake clowns?
00:20:15.797,00:20:16.965,"Bruce, listen."
00:20:18.050,00:20:23.722,Your greatest fear is being a part of a family again.
00:20:33.190,00:20:36.151,"Nope. Now it's snake clowns, because you put that idea in my head."
00:20:36.318,00:20:37.736,-Sir? -Time for push-ups!
00:20:37.903,00:20:39.821,"One, two... We're going to 1,000."
00:20:39.988,00:20:41.448,"I'm afraid that's not possible, sir."
00:20:41.615,00:20:43.408,It is possible. I'm already at 20.
00:20:43.575,00:20:46.328,You're scheduled to go to Jim Gordon's retirement party.
00:20:46.495,00:20:49.623,What? No. I don't wanna do that.
00:20:49.790,00:20:51.625,"-You're going to have a great time! -No, no, no."
00:20:51.792,00:20:53.043,You might meet some new people!
00:20:53.210,00:20:54.378,"No, no, no!"
00:20:54.544,00:20:55.587,You could even make some new friends.
00:20:55.754,00:20:59.424,"No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:21:02.010,00:21:04.763,"And before you go, we can do your favorite thing."
00:21:16.275,00:21:18.026,"Sir, aren't you forgetting something?"
00:21:18.235,00:21:20.279,-Nope. -Your cowl.
00:21:20.445,00:21:21.697,"My what, now?"
00:21:27.536,00:21:28.537,Fine.
00:21:30.414,00:21:32.291,-Happy now? -Indubitably.
00:21:32.457,00:21:34.501,Good. Must be nice to be happy.
00:21:37.170,00:21:39.589,"we have our favorite star, Superman!"
00:21:39.756,00:21:41.508,"What up, Gotham!"
00:21:42.968,00:21:48.181,"Superman, tell me. How do you feel about your recent banishment of Zod to the Phantom Zone?"
00:21:48.348,00:21:51.643,"Yeah, look, Pippa, it's... It's complicated. Okay?"
00:21:51.810,00:21:55.772,"Zod and I, we've had some pretty epic battles over the years."
00:21:57.482,00:22:00.569,I don't believe I would be Superman without fighting Zod.
00:22:00.736,00:22:05.115,See? Superman gets it. Why can't Batman?
00:22:05.282,00:22:08.869,"Check it out, guys. I built a CD rack. Ta-da!"
00:22:10.746,00:22:16.126,And how am I supposed to get Batman's respect when I'm working with these human farts?
00:22:16.293,00:22:17.919,"Boo-boo, look at me."
00:22:18.378,00:22:24.092,You're too good for Batman. He needs to open his eyes and see what it feels like when you're not around. Okay?
00:22:24.259,00:22:27.262,"Yeah, Pippa. I couldn't put Zod in a regular prison, right?"
00:22:27.429,00:22:28.847,He's Zod. Come on!
00:22:29.473,00:22:33.602,"No, he needed to go someplace where he could never harm Metropolis ever again."
00:22:34.978,00:22:36.229,The Phantom Zone.
00:22:38.607,00:22:40.984,that houses the greatest super-villains of all time.
00:22:41.151,00:22:43.945,"They've got, like, the sickest baddies up there."
00:22:44.112,00:22:45.197,"They got, like, this guy."
00:22:52.287,00:22:55.624,"I'm starting to get an idea, monkey face."
00:23:02.297,00:23:03.632,"Okay, shutterbugs. Look alive, here we go."
00:23:03.799,00:23:04.966,I'm gonna give you three poses. You ready?
00:23:05.133,00:23:06.134,Kissy face.
00:23:06.301,00:23:07.552,"Oops, I did it again."
00:23:07.719,00:23:09.805,And the Bad Boys. What you gonna do?
00:23:09.971,00:23:12.140,"I'm out of here, guys. Thank you."
00:23:12.307,00:23:14.726,"-Congresswoman. -Mr. Wayne, good to see you."
00:23:15.143,00:23:16.478,"-Senator, looking great. -Bruce."
00:23:20.148,00:23:21.525,"Bruce, any advice for the new commissioner?"
00:23:21.691,00:23:24.236,"Long as he knows how to push the button for the Bat-Signal, he'll be fine."
00:23:24.402,00:23:25.904,"Bruce, I don't know how you did it."
00:23:26.071,00:23:27.489,"You can't prove it, you didn't do it."
00:23:27.656,00:23:29.157,"Mr. Wayne, so great to see you! Come and join us!"
00:23:29.324,00:23:30.659,Mr. Prime Minister.
00:23:30.826,00:23:32.160,Did you have some work done?
00:23:34.121,00:23:35.122,No way!
00:23:36.623,00:23:37.833,Bruce Wayne!
00:23:37.999,00:23:39.793,He's the greatest orphan of all time.
00:23:43.004,00:23:45.048,"-Nice to see you, Mr. Ambassador. -Mr. Wayne!"
00:23:45.215,00:23:47.050,-You want a picture? -That would be swell!
00:23:48.969,00:23:50.262,Boom. Keep it.
00:23:50.428,00:23:51.429,"Whoa! Thanks, Mr. Wayne."
00:23:51.596,00:23:52.639,"Call me Bruce, champ."
00:23:52.806,00:23:54.266,"I'm just so jazzed to meet you, sir."
00:23:54.432,00:23:55.851,"I'm sorry, did you say jazzed?"
00:23:56.017,00:23:59.354,"Yes! My name's Richard Grayson, but all the kids at the orphanage call me Dick."
00:23:59.521,00:24:01.148,"-Well, children can be cruel. -Yeah."
00:24:01.314,00:24:02.524,"-Great to see you, Bruce. -Nice to see you, sir."
00:24:02.691,00:24:04.985,"-So, I had a question for you, sir. -Okay, hit me with it."
00:24:05.152,00:24:06.820,Do you have any advice on how to get adopted?
00:24:06.987,00:24:08.196,"-Oh, yeah. -Oh, you do?"
00:24:08.363,00:24:09.614,"-Mr. Wayne, can I get an autograph? -Sure."
00:24:09.865,00:24:12.033,"Um, all right, for example, is teeth whitener a good idea?"
00:24:12.200,00:24:13.451,"-Yes. There you go, pal. -Thanks!"
00:24:13.618,00:24:14.619,"-Really? -Oh, yeah."
00:24:14.786,00:24:16.329,"-Looking good, Bruce. -Thank you so much."
00:24:16.496,00:24:18.331,How about eyeliner or a foreign language?
00:24:18.498,00:24:19.875,-Try both. -Bueno.
00:24:20.041,00:24:21.334,"Look, it's the new commissioner!"
00:24:21.501,00:24:23.378,"-Where? Oh, she's with the mayor! -Okay. Let's see."
00:24:23.545,00:24:24.796,"Here she is, everyone!"
00:24:24.963,00:24:26.381,"-Oh, my darling! -Hi, Dad."
00:24:33.763,00:24:37.684,Should I get experimental surgery to make my eyes larger and more vulnerable-looking?
00:24:38.852,00:24:40.395,"Uh, do that."
00:24:49.154,00:24:50.739,"Uh, Mr. Wayne?"
00:24:50.906,00:24:53.158,Are you currently in the market to adopt a child?
00:24:53.658,00:24:55.076,-Yeah. -Really?
00:24:57.078,00:25:01.208,Are you looking for more of a base model orphan -or one that has more upgraded features? -Yep.
00:25:01.374,00:25:02.709,Like cooking or driftwood art?
00:25:02.876,00:25:04.002,-Gymnastic abilities? -Yep. Yep.
00:25:04.169,00:25:05.837,Close-up street magic à la David Blaine?
00:25:06.004,00:25:07.756,-All of it sounds great. -Really?
00:25:07.923,00:25:11.384,Because all of it sounds like me.
00:25:11.551,00:25:16.223,"Mr. Wayne, do you think you'd be interested in adopting me as your future orphan son?"
00:25:16.389,00:25:17.390,Definitely.
00:25:17.557,00:25:18.850,"Oh, this is great!"
00:25:19.017,00:25:26.149,"Because all I want is to get adopted, so I can finally stop being alone."
00:25:28.652,00:25:30.820,to mark the retirement of Jim Gordon.
00:25:30.987,00:25:31.988,Goodbye.
00:25:32.155,00:25:36.868,And we wish him well on his South African jungle safari!
00:25:38.286,00:25:42.165,"Now, to introduce you to his exciting new replacement."
00:25:42.332,00:25:44.918,"Everyone, meet your new commissioner!"
00:25:49.631,00:25:53.802,-The new commissioner of Gotham City! -Whoa!
00:25:54.010,00:25:57.472,She was top of her class at Harvard for Police.
00:25:57.639,00:26:05.981,She cleaned up the streets of Gotham's nearby sister city Blüdhaven using statistics and compassion.
00:26:06.147,00:26:12.612,And now she's bringing her new ideas and her nunchucks to Gotham City.
00:26:12.779,00:26:14.698,"Congratulations, darling."
00:26:14.864,00:26:16.783,"-Thanks, Dad. -Here she is, everyone!"
00:26:16.950,00:26:18.285,Thank you! Thanks!
00:26:18.451,00:26:19.661,Hurray!
00:26:22.622,00:26:25.292,Thank you for the oversized key to Arkham Asylum.
00:26:25.458,00:26:27.252,"And, uh, what's this?"
00:26:27.419,00:26:30.714,Thank you for the switch to the Bat-Signal.
00:26:30.880,00:26:32.090,Nice.
00:26:33.550,00:26:38.471,"Dad, you've always done a great job protecting Gotham City."
00:26:40.890,00:26:43.560,"Thank you. Along with Batman, of course."
00:26:43.727,00:26:45.186,Whoo! Let's hear it for Batman!
00:26:45.353,00:26:46.980,Who I wish was here right now.
00:26:48.857,00:26:50.525,I'd like to ask all of you a question.
00:26:50.692,00:26:52.694,Are you fed up with crime?
00:26:52.986,00:26:55.113,"-Uh-huh. We're all tired of crime. -Yeah, we're sick of it."
00:26:55.280,00:26:59.534,Great. Then let's talk about real improvements that will end the cycle of crime.
00:26:59.868,00:27:03.288,I've got a four-point pilot program that I'd love to share with you.
00:27:03.455,00:27:05.040,I wanna hear all four points.
00:27:05.206,00:27:06.374,-It's called... -I am ready.
00:27:06.541,00:27:07.542,It takes a village...
00:27:07.709,00:27:08.918,Best opening to a title ever.
00:27:09.085,00:27:10.587,Not a Batman.
00:27:11.379,00:27:12.380,-Waiter. -Sir?
00:27:12.547,00:27:13.548,-Can I? -Of course.
00:27:13.715,00:27:14.883,-Thank you. -My pleasure.
00:27:15.050,00:27:16.051,Thanks so much.
00:27:18.386,00:27:19.971,-What? -Look.
00:27:20.138,00:27:27.562,"Batman's been on the job for a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very long time."
00:27:27.729,00:27:29.397,He has aged phenomenally.
00:27:29.564,00:27:38.406,"However, despite all the great work Batman has done for us, Gotham City is still the most crime-ridden city in the world."
00:27:38.573,00:27:39.657,-She's got a great point. -Interesting.
00:27:39.824,00:27:41.701,"Historically speaking, that is accurate."
00:27:43.787,00:27:44.871,He hasn't captured Bane.
00:27:45.038,00:27:46.956,-Huh! -Or Catwoman.
00:27:47.123,00:27:51.086,"Or Two-Face, or any of Gotham's other villains!"
00:27:51.252,00:27:52.253,He's not good at his job.
00:27:52.420,00:27:53.880,Including the Joker!
00:27:56.174,00:27:57.759,Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Excuse me.
00:27:59.594,00:28:01.346,-Yes. -Hi. Bruce Wayne.
00:28:01.513,00:28:06.768,"Billionaire, bon vivant, gallivanter, playboy, Gotham's most eligible bachelor, like, 90 years in a row."
00:28:06.935,00:28:08.770,"-That's me right there. -I know who you are, Mr. Wayne."
00:28:08.978,00:28:15.610,"You bet you do. Quick quest, what is your problem with Batman, and also, what the heck, dude?"
00:28:15.777,00:28:17.237,"I'm glad you asked, Mr. Wayne."
00:28:17.404,00:28:19.447,I'm not a Batman hater.
00:28:19.614,00:28:24.828,But we don't need an unsupervised adult man karate-chopping poor people in a Halloween costume.
00:28:25.203,00:28:33.878,"We need to take what's good about Batman, and marry it to actual laws and proper ethics and accountability."
00:28:34.295,00:28:35.463,I hate everything you just said.
00:28:35.630,00:28:40.552,Because my dream is for the police force to team up with Batman.
00:28:40.719,00:28:41.720,Waiter.
00:28:43.805,00:28:47.016,"And I know that, together, the world's greatest detective..."
00:28:49.811,00:28:51.813,could clean up these crime-ridden streets.
00:28:54.149,00:28:55.275,Forever.
00:29:01.823,00:29:04.284,Everyone! Make your way to the exits immediately!
00:29:05.869,00:29:07.829,"Team Bane, block the exits."
00:29:07.996,00:29:09.247,Going somewhere?
00:29:09.497,00:29:12.208,"Clayface, Freeze, bring me the new Commissioner Gordon."
00:29:12.375,00:29:14.002,-We're on it. -Cool.
00:29:14.169,00:29:15.879,"And, Harley, you know what to do."
00:29:16.045,00:29:17.046,I sure do.
00:29:17.255,00:29:20.800,It's time for Operation Take Out the Laundry.
00:29:24.179,00:29:26.973,"-Go ahead, Bat One. -I need my armored face disguise, now!"
00:29:27.140,00:29:28.349,Only if you say the magic word.
00:29:28.516,00:29:29.601,-Now! -No.
00:29:29.768,00:29:33.730,"-You're fired. -No. Sir, we'll talk about this back at the Batcave."
00:29:37.233,00:29:38.943,Initialize masterbuild music.
00:29:39.110,00:29:40.278,Right away.
00:29:40.945,00:29:44.032,"Collateral damage assessment suggests the Scuttler, sir."
00:29:44.199,00:29:45.325,Good plan.
00:29:52.373,00:29:53.374,Head for the south exit.
00:29:53.917,00:29:55.001,"Now, ma'am."
00:29:57.128,00:29:58.129,Go! Go! Go!
00:29:58.296,00:29:59.714,"Honey, let Batman take care of it."
00:29:59.881,00:30:01.216,"Dad, I got this."
00:30:15.230,00:30:17.357,"Chief O'Hara, we're coming in hot!"
00:30:17.524,00:30:19.025,I'm almost there.
00:30:28.701,00:30:30.745,"Team, I got the Joker in my sights."
00:30:35.250,00:30:36.251,Joker!
00:30:36.417,00:30:37.418,Joker.
00:30:37.585,00:30:42.090,"Uh, excuse me? I was about to-- Push the Bat-Signal? Good call. I like your instincts."
00:30:44.384,00:30:46.427,And it's gonna make you smile.
00:30:46.594,00:30:48.596,Uh-oh! His smile is our grimace.
00:30:48.763,00:30:49.764,"Everybody, get down."
00:30:49.931,00:30:51.683,"-I... -Joker, no!"
00:30:52.600,00:30:53.768,Surrender.
00:30:54.143,00:30:55.603,What?
00:30:56.563,00:30:58.398,"Uh, what did you just say?"
00:30:58.565,00:31:01.818,"I said, I surrender."
00:31:03.444,00:31:07.532,"I'm sorry, my Bat-ears must be malfunctioning because it sounds-- I surrender!"
00:31:07.699,00:31:10.118,"Okay, you know what? Cool it. You're a criminal."
00:31:12.495,00:31:13.788,"Not anymore, Batman."
00:31:13.955,00:31:15.999,You were right. There is no us.
00:31:16.165,00:31:19.460,"So, there's no point in me trying to fight you anymore."
00:31:19.627,00:31:24.841,"Therefore, I will be surrendering myself to our strong-willed and forward-thinking new commissioner."
00:31:25.008,00:31:26.551,"Blink, blink, blink. Blinkety blink, blink, blink!"
00:31:26.718,00:31:27.719,That's really suspicious.
00:31:27.886,00:31:30.096,"Yeah, it is. What are you up to, Joker?"
00:31:30.263,00:31:32.724,I just wanna go to Arkham and pay for all of my crimes.
00:31:32.891,00:31:34.475,"Blink, blink, blink. Blinkety blink, blink, blink!"
00:31:34.642,00:31:36.686,Are you actually saying blink?
00:31:36.853,00:31:38.146,"No! Blink, blink, blink."
00:31:38.313,00:31:39.314,Joker! That's enough.
00:31:39.480,00:31:41.024,"Okay, Babs. I got this."
00:31:41.190,00:31:44.652,"Not so fast, Batman. You can't fight me anymore."
00:31:44.819,00:31:45.820,I'm off the market.
00:31:45.987,00:31:47.697,What are you talking about?
00:31:47.864,00:31:49.699,I'm off the menu.
00:31:49.866,00:31:52.660,You won't get to fight any of this anymore.
00:31:52.994,00:31:54.662,"Man, am I sorry I asked."
00:31:54.829,00:31:59.042,"Anyway, have fun in jail and-- Batman, what are you doing?"
00:32:01.210,00:32:02.837,That was unnecessary.
00:32:03.004,00:32:05.298,"Oh, no, you can't fight Bane anymore either."
00:32:08.843,00:32:10.345,Or Catwoman. Or Condiment King.
00:32:11.095,00:32:12.096,Why not?
00:32:12.263,00:32:16.017,"Because we're all surrendering. Right, guys?"
00:32:17.352,00:32:18.478,Yes!
00:32:28.905,00:32:30.365,It's the end of crime!
00:32:30.907,00:32:31.824,All right!
00:32:32.033,00:32:33.034,"-That was amazing! -Over here, over here!"
00:32:33.242,00:32:38.081,"-You did it! -Yeah, of course I did. I'm-- Sorry, not you. We're talking to Commissioner Gordon."
00:32:38.247,00:32:40.208,"-Well, it was a team effort. -I got this, Babs."
00:32:40.375,00:32:41.751,"Commissioner, how do you feel?"
00:32:41.918,00:32:44.003,Amazing! This is a great first day.
00:32:45.505,00:32:46.714,-Question for Batman. -Shoot.
00:32:46.881,00:32:48.257,What are you gonna do with the rest of your life?
00:32:48.424,00:32:49.968,"What do you mean, the rest of my life?"
00:32:50.134,00:32:53.012,We don't need a vigilante crime fighter now that there's no more crime.
00:32:53.179,00:32:54.222,"Uh, yes, you do."
00:32:54.389,00:32:56.808,You can spend some quality time with your family.
00:32:57.767,00:32:58.768,My...
00:33:03.481,00:33:05.942,"Okay, Batman. We'll take it from here."
00:33:06.109,00:33:07.235,"All right, listen up."
00:33:07.402,00:33:09.696,All of you have the right to remain silent.
00:33:09.862,00:33:10.905,Let's roll out!
00:33:22.667,00:33:28.256,Today is a victory for the citizens of Gotham City!
00:33:32.260,00:33:35.263,No more crime! No more crime! No more crime!
00:33:35.430,00:33:38.725,No more crime! No more crime! No more crime!
00:33:42.603,00:33:43.771,"Is everything okay, sir?"
00:33:43.938,00:33:45.606,You've barely touched your lobster thermidor.
00:33:53.948,00:33:56.826,Pigeon pose. Tree pose.
00:34:00.997,00:34:02.123,Tree pose.
00:34:02.290,00:34:03.332,"Hey, Batman!"
00:34:03.499,00:34:04.667,Barbara!
00:34:04.834,00:34:05.835,What are you doing?
00:34:06.002,00:34:07.795,Nothing. I have a very full life.
00:34:07.962,00:34:10.465,"No, I mean, what are you doing here?"
00:34:10.631,00:34:13.801,Surveillance. On the Joker.
00:34:13.968,00:34:16.888,"Batman, we both know the Joker's up to something."
00:34:17.055,00:34:19.724,"Well, then we can't just let him run around loose in a prison."
00:34:19.891,00:34:21.142,He's not loose.
00:34:21.309,00:34:23.478,He has to go someplace outside the law.
00:34:23.644,00:34:25.313,-Outside the law? -Yeah.
00:34:25.521,00:34:27.482,"Somewhere like, uh..."
00:34:27.648,00:34:30.735,"Hi, there. I'm here from Phantom's Own Laundry."
00:34:30.902,00:34:32.862,Here to take that bad stuff off your hands.
00:34:33.029,00:34:35.656,"Wait, that's it! The Phantom Zone."
00:34:35.823,00:34:37.658,The Phantom Zone? No way!
00:34:37.825,00:34:41.412,That is super illegal and way outside our jurisdiction.
00:34:41.788,00:34:47.710,"So, why don't you and I work together inside the law, to figure out what he's up to?"
00:34:47.877,00:34:50.671,Batman works alone. That's my motto. Copyright Batman.
00:34:52.006,00:34:56.094,"Batman, there are no more vigilantes allowed in Gotham City."
00:34:56.260,00:34:57.720,Okay. Totally got it.
00:34:57.887,00:35:01.349,Then I have to go into double-secret super vigilante mode.
00:35:01.891,00:35:03.893,You said that out loud.
00:35:04.519,00:35:07.396,"I know that she said I said that out loud, but there's no way I did."
00:35:07.563,00:35:10.525,She has no idea what's going on in my super-mind.
00:35:12.610,00:35:13.945,Smoke bomb!
00:35:18.866,00:35:21.702,"Computer, how do I put the Joker in the Phantom Zone?"
00:35:21.869,00:35:23.955,"Quickest route, no freeways."
00:35:27.166,00:35:28.459,"'Puter, do you hear me?"
00:35:30.962,00:35:32.630,"Hello, Master Bruce."
00:35:32.797,00:35:35.341,"Alfred, there's something wrong with the Batcomputer. Watch this."
00:35:35.508,00:35:37.218,'Puter. Nothing.
00:35:37.385,00:35:39.137,'Puter. Do you see what I'm saying?
00:35:39.303,00:35:40.513,"There's nothing wrong with it, sir."
00:35:40.680,00:35:43.266,I have just taken away your computer privileges.
00:35:46.185,00:35:47.979,The parental lock? You can't do that.
00:35:48.146,00:35:52.900,"Oh, I can. I've been reading Setting Limits for Your Out-of-Control Child."
00:35:53.067,00:35:57.655,"You know what? Doesn't matter, 'cause I have a double-secret super password that unlocks the parental lock."
00:35:57.822,00:36:01.117,"You mean, Alfred da Butt-ler, with two T's?"
00:36:02.577,00:36:04.954,"Sir, it's time for you to stop this unhealthy behavior."
00:36:05.121,00:36:06.581,"No, it's not."
00:36:06.747,00:36:08.291,You need to take responsibility for your life.
00:36:08.457,00:36:09.917,"Not right now, I don't."
00:36:10.084,00:36:12.712,And it starts by raising your son.
00:36:15.965,00:36:16.966,I'm sorry.
00:36:17.133,00:36:19.927,I literally have no idea what you're talking about.
00:36:20.094,00:36:23.055,The young orphan you adopted at the gala. Remember?
00:36:25.349,00:36:28.352,Wow! Stairs. Whee!
00:36:28.769,00:36:30.980,He's been living here for the past week.
00:36:31.147,00:36:33.774,"Hello, table! Boom!"
00:36:42.742,00:36:45.286,-You and he have a lot in common. -En garde.
00:36:47.205,00:36:48.956,"Hello, family photos."
00:36:53.169,00:36:54.921,I've always wanted one of those.
00:36:57.089,00:37:05.306,"Doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?"
00:37:08.434,00:37:12.313,"Alfred, you've been watching way too many Lifetime movies and drinking chardonnay."
00:37:12.480,00:37:14.065,"-It's Pinot grigio, sir. -Whatever it is."
00:37:14.232,00:37:16.275,"Listen, you don't have a family."
00:37:16.484,00:37:17.860,You're satisfied serving me.
00:37:18.527,00:37:20.863,So what do you know about having a surrogate son?
00:37:21.447,00:37:26.160,"Now, I'm gonna go fight crime while you put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage. Got it?"
00:37:27.995,00:37:29.121,"As you wish, sir."
00:37:30.831,00:37:32.250,Whoops-a-daisy.
00:37:35.044,00:37:36.045,Dusting.
00:37:36.212,00:37:37.255,You can't let him into the Batcave!
00:37:37.421,00:37:42.260,I'm not. I'm letting him into your life via the Batcave.
00:37:52.270,00:37:53.271,What?
00:37:57.358,00:37:59.860,"Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh."
00:38:00.027,00:38:02.029,"Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh."
00:38:02.196,00:38:04.740,"Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh."
00:38:09.745,00:38:10.913,"You're darn right, Whoa."
00:38:11.080,00:38:13.374,"Wait, does Batman live in Bruce Wayne's basement?"
00:38:13.541,00:38:15.710,No. Bruce Wayne lives in Batman's attic.
00:38:15.876,00:38:18.004,"-We can have sleepovers every night! -No, we can't."
00:38:18.170,00:38:20.256,"-Wow! Look, it's the Bat-Sub! -Wait, don't touch that!"
00:38:20.423,00:38:21.632,"Over there, it's the Bat-Space shuttle."
00:38:21.799,00:38:22.800,"Please, keep your hands off that."
00:38:22.967,00:38:24.427,"-Look, it's the Bat-Zeppelin! -Don't touch that either!"
00:38:24.593,00:38:25.594,-It's the Bat-Train! -No!
00:38:25.761,00:38:26.887,-It's the Bat-Kayak. -No!
00:38:27.054,00:38:28.097,-It's the Bat-Dune buggy. -No!
00:38:28.264,00:38:30.057,It's the Bat shark repellent?
00:38:31.892,00:38:34.895,"Uh, actually, you can touch that. It's completely useless."
00:38:35.104,00:38:36.439,"Whoa! Thanks, Batman!"
00:38:36.647,00:38:38.816,"Please, stand over there."
00:38:38.983,00:38:43.404,"And don't touch, look at, or do anything for the remaining moments you have in my presence."
00:38:43.571,00:38:44.613,"Okay, cool."
00:38:44.780,00:38:46.240,-Computer. -Go ahead.
00:38:46.407,00:38:48.534,How do I put the Joker in the Phantom Zone?
00:38:50.911,00:38:52.496,using the Phantom Zone Projector.
00:38:52.663,00:38:58.294,"Current location, Superman's Fortress of Solitude inside the Atomic Cauldron."
00:38:58.461,00:39:04.258,"However, only a person that isn't shredded, ripped, or extremely swoll can enter the cauldron."
00:39:04.425,00:39:06.135,"Ugh, I'm way too buff."
00:39:08.220,00:39:09.597,That's my cross to bear.
00:39:09.764,00:39:18.564,"Additionally, once inside the cauldron, multiple Kryptonian defense systems engage, including the Acid Moat, Ring of Napalm, and the Jaws of Death."
00:39:18.731,00:39:22.193,Chance of total mission failure is 110%.
00:39:22.360,00:39:24.612,Those are not great odds.
00:39:24.779,00:39:25.780,Wait a minute.
00:39:25.946,00:39:27.114,"-Hey, kid. -Yes, sir?"
00:39:27.281,00:39:28.991,"-You're super nimble, right? -I sure am!"
00:39:29.158,00:39:30.242,-And small? -Very.
00:39:32.244,00:39:34.121,And 110% expendable?
00:39:34.288,00:39:36.082,"I don't know what that means, but okay."
00:39:36.248,00:39:37.833,Great. Follow me.
00:39:38.000,00:39:40.836,We are gonna steal the Phantom Zone Projector from Superman.
00:39:41.003,00:39:42.004,-Steal? -Yeah.
00:39:42.171,00:39:43.756,We have to right a wrong.
00:39:43.923,00:39:46.842,"And, sometimes, in order to right a wrong, you have to do a wrong-right."
00:39:47.009,00:39:48.010,Gandhi said that.
00:39:48.177,00:39:49.428,Are we sure Gandhi said that?
00:39:49.595,00:39:51.263,-I'm paraphrasing. -Cool!
00:39:53.599,00:39:54.934,Wow! Look at all these!
00:39:55.101,00:39:56.477,"Do I get a costume for the mission, too?"
00:39:56.644,00:39:59.146,I got a feeling that you'll just look like a kid on Halloween.
00:39:59.355,00:40:00.356,Don't you think?
00:40:00.564,00:40:01.607,Don't touch that.
00:40:05.194,00:40:06.570,-That one is culturally insensitive. -Night Terror.
00:40:11.534,00:40:12.952,-This one. -Clawed Reigns.
00:40:13.119,00:40:14.453,-Excali-Bat. -This one?
00:40:17.873,00:40:18.958,How do we feel about this one?
00:40:19.125,00:40:21.043,Dress-up parties are for grown-ups only.
00:40:21.210,00:40:22.378,Wait. What's that one there?
00:40:23.963,00:40:25.172,The Jamaican Caper.
00:40:25.339,00:40:27.341,The locals called me Reggae Man.
00:40:27.508,00:40:28.634,I love it!
00:40:28.801,00:40:30.636,Ah! Feels like I was poured into this.
00:40:30.803,00:40:34.014,"My only trouble is, these pants are just a little tight."
00:40:34.181,00:40:36.350,I don't know if I could throw a kick or jump in them.
00:40:36.517,00:40:39.186,I got an idea. Rip! That's better!
00:40:39.353,00:40:40.729,"Now I'm free, now I'm moving."
00:40:40.896,00:40:42.898,"Come on, Batman. Let's get grooving!"
00:40:43.149,00:40:45.109,I can only look you in the eyes right now.
00:40:45.276,00:40:47.736,"-Sir, what are you doing? -What do you mean?"
00:40:47.987,00:40:50.114,Why is Master Dick dressed like that?
00:40:50.322,00:40:53.868,How dare you tell me how to parent my kid I just met?
00:40:54.034,00:40:55.077,To the Batmobile!
00:40:55.244,00:40:56.412,Hot-diggity-dog!
00:41:01.625,00:41:03.794,Retrieving the Speedwagon.
00:41:04.795,00:41:06.380,Atomic batteries to power.
00:41:06.589,00:41:07.631,Turbines to speed.
00:41:08.048,00:41:09.633,"Hey, kid. Let's go."
00:41:10.259,00:41:11.927,"-Oh, shoot! -What?"
00:41:12.636,00:41:18.392,"I probably shouldn't leave until I get the thumbs up from my new old man, Bruce Wayne."
00:41:20.019,00:41:22.229,"Uh, yeah. Here's the thing."
00:41:24.064,00:41:28.569,Bruno and I decided to share custody of you.
00:41:28.736,00:41:32.990,So I get a say and you're mission approved.
00:41:33.157,00:41:35.242,No way! Is this really happening?
00:41:35.409,00:41:36.494,Yeah.
00:41:36.744,00:41:37.786,Whoo-hoo!
00:41:37.995,00:41:39.413,"A month ago, I had no dads."
00:41:39.580,00:41:41.582,Then I had one dad. Now I have two dads!
00:41:41.749,00:41:43.876,-And one of them is Batman! -Yeah.
00:41:45.544,00:41:51.842,"So, are you ready to follow Batman and maybe learn a few life lessons along the way?"
00:41:52.009,00:41:53.427,"I sure am, Dad Two!"
00:41:53.594,00:41:55.346,"But first, where's the seatbelt?"
00:41:55.513,00:41:59.099,"The first lesson is, life doesn't give you seatbelts!"
00:41:59.266,00:42:01.268,-Let's go! -Whoo-hoo!
00:42:01.560,00:42:02.770,Yes!
00:42:04.438,00:42:06.065,"Faster, Dad! Faster!"
00:42:07.024,00:42:08.025,-Whoo! -Yeah!
00:42:08.192,00:42:09.193,-Whoo! -Yeah!
00:42:12.154,00:42:14.657,"Oh! Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry."
00:42:14.823,00:42:16.617,Get back up in that seat. There you go.
00:42:16.784,00:42:21.455,"Hey, listen. As soon as I get back to the Batcave, I'll make sure that Alfred puts seatbelts on there, okay?"
00:42:21.622,00:42:24.625,"But for the time being, I'm just gonna put my arm right here."
00:42:24.792,00:42:27.920,And we're just gonna gently ease out of here.
00:42:28.087,00:42:30.047,And here we go.
00:42:42.935,00:42:51.944,"Okay. Like all superheroes, Superman has zero friends, and he spends most of his time basking in sweet, sweet isolation, here at his alone palace."
00:42:52.236,00:42:56.574,"So, I'll keep him busy while you sneak into that vent and get the Projector. Got it?"
00:42:56.740,00:42:59.743,"Copy that! Oh, here's an idea. I could also-- Whoa, whoa. Don't even finish that thought."
00:42:59.910,00:43:02.830,See this counter? These are all the good ideas Batman has.
00:43:03.247,00:43:05.874,And no one else has ever had any good ideas. So don't even try.
00:43:07.835,00:43:10.504,Is excellent listening and execution of my ideas.
00:43:10.671,00:43:12.423,-Let's try it out. -Cool!
00:43:12.590,00:43:14.425,Drop to the ground. Do a backflip.
00:43:14.592,00:43:16.135,Do a front flip. Triple axel.
00:43:16.302,00:43:18.637,Plié. Relevé. Jeté. Pythagorean theorem.
00:43:18.804,00:43:20.014,A squared plus B squared equals C squared.
00:43:20.180,00:43:21.181,Physicalize it!
00:43:21.348,00:43:25.352,A squared plus B squared equals C squared.
00:43:25.603,00:43:26.604,"-How'd I do, Dad? -Mediocre."
00:43:26.770,00:43:27.771,Yes!
00:43:27.938,00:43:29.690,"And don't call me Dad. Now, begin mission."
00:43:29.857,00:43:30.858,"Yes, Papa."
00:43:31.025,00:43:33.277,Papa falls into the Dad category.
00:43:55.132,00:43:57.009,And he's at my house.
00:43:57.176,00:43:58.218,Right now.
00:43:58.427,00:43:59.762,What are you doing here?
00:43:59.928,00:44:02.890,"Don't worry about it, dawg. I'm not here to throw down or anything."
00:44:03.057,00:44:04.600,"Uh, no, I would crush you."
00:44:07.519,00:44:11.065,"Hey, listen. Thank me later, but I just happened to be in the hood."
00:44:11.231,00:44:14.068,And I figured that you could probably use the...
00:44:20.491,00:44:22.242,Wait a minute.
00:44:22.660,00:44:35.547,Are you... Are you having the 57th Annual Justice League Anniversary Party No! There must have been some mistake with the email.
00:44:35.714,00:44:36.757,"That's crazy, man."
00:44:36.924,00:44:39.885,"Totally! Yes, email mistakes happen all the time."
00:44:40.052,00:44:44.098,Sometimes I don't get Superman's emails for years.
00:44:44.264,00:44:45.766,"Great point, G.L. Great point."
00:44:45.933,00:44:47.434,"All right. Well, that clears up everything, right?"
00:44:47.601,00:44:48.602,"Enjoy the party, bro."
00:44:48.769,00:44:50.938,"Hit it, DJ Wonder Dog."
00:44:54.650,00:45:00.364,"I'm Superman at the super party Hey-hey Hey, Batman. Do you wanna take a quick pic?"
00:45:00.531,00:45:01.865,Sure. Where do you want me?
00:45:02.032,00:45:03.033,Right there is perfect.
00:45:03.200,00:45:04.284,-Here's the camera. -Oh.
00:45:04.701,00:45:06.662,"Okay, party people, get together."
00:45:06.829,00:45:11.667,Yeah. Everybody say-- Let me see it! Let me see!
00:45:11.834,00:45:13.419,Classic! We got everyone.
00:45:14.044,00:45:15.504,"Yeah, everyone."
00:45:16.964,00:45:19.591,"Yeah, no problem. I did, like, a burst."
00:45:21.927,00:45:25.305,"Look at me! More like Martian Dance Hunter, am I right?"
00:45:26.974,00:45:28.267,"'Puter, call kid."
00:45:29.017,00:45:30.018,Bat-Dad?
00:45:30.436,00:45:31.437,How's it going?
00:45:31.603,00:45:33.647,'Cause everything is going great down here.
00:45:33.814,00:45:34.815,I can see the target.
00:45:34.982,00:45:37.484,But there's some kind of laser energy thing that I can't get through.
00:45:37.651,00:45:39.445,Okay. I'll see if I can shut it off.
00:45:39.611,00:45:43.198,But I'm gonna have to make up an excuse to leave this party without anyone noticing.
00:45:44.658,00:45:45.701,Bye.
00:45:47.077,00:45:48.162,"Kid, tell me when it's off, all right?"
00:45:48.328,00:45:49.329,-Now? -No.
00:45:49.496,00:45:50.539,-Now? -No.
00:45:50.706,00:45:51.748,-Now? -Not quite.
00:45:51.915,00:45:52.916,-Now? -No.
00:45:53.083,00:45:54.168,-My son... -No.
00:45:54.334,00:45:58.255,"These irreplaceable crystals contain all my knowledge, which I now pass on to..."
00:45:58.422,00:46:00.466,Darn it. It's gotta be one of these. Is this the one?
00:46:01.383,00:46:03.260,"O.M. gosh! You did it, Padre! It's off!"
00:46:03.427,00:46:04.428,Okay.
00:46:04.595,00:46:08.056,Now you gotta make your way to the Atomic Cauldron and get that Phantom Zone Projector.
00:46:08.265,00:46:10.225,-Do exactly as I say. -10-4!
00:46:10.392,00:46:11.560,Okay. Jump!
00:46:13.312,00:46:15.147,Do a front flip. Do a backflip.
00:46:16.482,00:46:18.609,"Run, run, run. Drop."
00:46:18.775,00:46:20.152,That's excellent listening.
00:46:20.319,00:46:21.320,Shimmy.
00:46:21.487,00:46:23.489,Strafe-left. Strafe-right.
00:46:23.655,00:46:24.698,Avoid.
00:46:24.865,00:46:30.537,"Hey, I was thinking. If I'm gonna be a superhero, and go on awesome superhero missions like this one, can we use code names?"
00:46:31.830,00:46:32.831,Mine can be Robin.
00:46:32.998,00:46:34.666,"-I'm sorry, say that again? -Robin!"
00:46:34.833,00:46:37.419,"As in the small, Midwestern frail bird?"
00:46:37.586,00:46:40.172,"Yeah, and I already have a catch phrase. Tweet, tweet, on the street."
00:46:40.339,00:46:41.715,-Hard pass. -And a song.
00:46:46.178,00:46:49.723,"Okay, kid. I'm gonna teach you how to masterbuild your way inside that thing."
00:46:49.890,00:46:50.891,Yay!
00:46:51.058,00:46:54.561,"Grab those 2x6's, pull out the axle studs, disconnect the 6x10 plates."
00:46:54.728,00:46:55.729,Like this?
00:46:55.938,00:46:57.773,Whoa! Unbelievable obeying.
00:46:57.940,00:46:59.066,"Now, let's ride."
00:46:59.233,00:47:00.400,Toes to the nose.
00:47:00.567,00:47:01.818,Now you're gleaming the cube.
00:47:01.985,00:47:03.737,"-Yeah! -Now, get creative."
00:47:03.904,00:47:06.156,"Freestyle a little bit. Oh, that's good, kid!"
00:47:06.323,00:47:08.367,It's like looking in a Bat-mirror.
00:47:13.163,00:47:15.040,"-I've got the Projector, Dad. -Booyah!"
00:47:15.207,00:47:18.085,Now do everything we just did backwards.
00:47:18.418,00:47:19.586,Oh.
00:47:20.754,00:47:22.673,"Oh! Here you go, Dad. We did it!"
00:47:22.839,00:47:26.051,Yeah! Mission accomplished. That was fun!
00:47:28.303,00:47:31.181,"You okay, Batman? You seem the opposite of stern."
00:47:32.015,00:47:40.107,"Yeah, I'm fine. It's just watching you out there, it was like the world wasn't all darkness anymore."
00:47:41.567,00:47:46.905,For a brief moment I could have sworn I felt something.
00:47:50.158,00:47:51.493,You're right.
00:47:51.660,00:47:53.328,I am super proud.
00:47:55.163,00:47:56.999,Of myself.
00:47:57.165,00:48:00.460,"For being such a good teacher, obviously."
00:48:00.794,00:48:02.963,"Yeah, you're a great teacher."
00:48:03.130,00:48:04.131,I am?
00:48:04.298,00:48:07.384,"Yeah! I wanna be just like you when I grow up, Padre!"
00:48:07.551,00:48:09.219,"Wait, what did you call me?"
00:48:10.304,00:48:11.847,I called you Padre.
00:48:12.681,00:48:15.434,It's Spanish for Dad. Sorry.
00:48:15.601,00:48:18.979,"Well, isn't it also a cool Spanish way to say buddy?"
00:48:19.146,00:48:21.023,"Yeah, I could've been saying it that way."
00:48:21.189,00:48:22.274,Then I'll allow it.
00:48:22.441,00:48:23.775,"Oh, you're such a great padre!"
00:48:24.318,00:48:25.319,What are you doing?
00:48:25.485,00:48:27.487,I'm trying to give you a big old hug.
00:48:27.654,00:48:28.989,Thought you were attacking me.
00:48:30.032,00:48:34.077,"Hey, you up for another top secret superhero mission to defeat the Joker?"
00:48:36.538,00:48:38.832,"But I don't wanna make my other dad, Bruce Wayne, angry."
00:48:38.999,00:48:40.334,Do you think we'll be done before my bedtime?
00:48:40.500,00:48:41.501,Bedtime?
00:48:41.668,00:48:43.170,Batman's life lesson number two.
00:48:43.337,00:48:45.172,Vigilantes don't have bedtimes.
00:48:45.339,00:48:46.340,Yes!
00:48:46.506,00:48:49.551,"So, what's the vigilante policy on cookies?"
00:48:49.843,00:48:51.678,Unlimited!
00:48:52.846,00:48:56.016,"All right, kid. We need to avoid Commissioner Gordon."
00:48:57.184,00:48:58.894,"So, lesson number three."
00:48:59.519,00:49:04.941,"When going stealth, you gotta hide every part of you, physically and emotionally."
00:49:05.525,00:49:06.568,-Got it? -Yeah!
00:49:06.735,00:49:07.736,Already failed.
00:49:07.903,00:49:17.287,"Now, what I need you to do is use the naturally dark areas of your costume, and integrate into the dark parts of this environment."
00:49:17.454,00:49:18.538,Okay.
00:49:18.705,00:49:20.582,-Can you see me? -Yes.
00:49:20.749,00:49:22.584,-How about now? -Yes.
00:49:22.751,00:49:24.628,-What about now? Now? -Yes.
00:49:24.795,00:49:26.546,"Yes. You're a goner, kid."
00:49:31.093,00:49:32.969,Batman? Batman!
00:49:33.637,00:49:34.888,"Hey, there. Look at you."
00:49:35.055,00:49:36.515,"-Who's this? -Hi, police lady."
00:49:36.723,00:49:38.225,"-Is that your son? -Yes, I am."
00:49:38.392,00:49:40.310,"Is that my son... No, that's just weird."
00:49:40.477,00:49:41.812,It's weirder if it's not your son.
00:49:44.481,00:49:46.441,I'm not in a relationship or anything.
00:49:46.608,00:49:48.235,I could have a kid.
00:49:48.735,00:49:57.411,"I mean, if I met the right lady, and if she was just standing right in front of me, and we looked at each other and thought, Hey, let's do this."
00:49:57.577,00:49:59.329,Let's be together.
00:49:59.496,00:50:00.956,-Batman? -Yes?
00:50:01.123,00:50:05.419,I hope you're back because you've decided to work together on the Joker case.
00:50:05.669,00:50:06.712,Uh...
00:50:06.920,00:50:09.172,Yeah. Absolutely!
00:50:09.381,00:50:10.382,Great.
00:50:13.677,00:50:14.803,"-So, before we question the Joker... -Uh-huh."
00:50:14.970,00:50:16.346,I'm gonna need you to hand over all your weapons.
00:50:16.513,00:50:18.265,"I mean, I don't know if I have anything..."
00:50:19.766,00:50:21.101,I just got a couple here. There.
00:50:21.268,00:50:22.352,-Is that it? -Yeah.
00:50:23.687,00:50:25.439,What about the utility belt? Anything in your cape?
00:50:27.107,00:50:28.316,And your shoes.
00:50:28.483,00:50:29.484,There we go.
00:50:29.651,00:50:31.361,Uh... This is really uncomfortable.
00:50:31.528,00:50:33.447,Sorry. My shoes are part of my pants.
00:50:34.865,00:50:35.866,Oops.
00:50:36.032,00:50:37.242,-Batman? -Yes?
00:50:37.409,00:50:41.788,Why is your not son trying to smuggle the Phantom Zone Projector into Arkham?
00:50:41.955,00:50:44.499,"What? Hey, kid. What is this?"
00:50:44.666,00:50:46.710,"Batman, give me the Phantom Zone Projector."
00:50:46.877,00:50:47.878,-No. -Batman!
00:50:48.044,00:50:49.463,Give me the Phantom Zone Projector! Give it to me!
00:50:49.629,00:50:50.922,"No, no, no! Whoa! Nice."
00:50:51.256,00:50:53.467,I studied Brazilian jiu-jitsu at Harvard for Police.
00:50:53.633,00:50:56.178,"Oh, yeah? Well, guess who got a PhD in smoke bombs!"
00:50:58.972,00:50:59.973,"Freeze, Batman!"
00:51:00.140,00:51:03.226,"Hey, kid. This is a training exercise. These guys are my bros."
00:51:03.393,00:51:04.978,-Go ahead and take a couple of them out. -Cool!
00:51:11.902,00:51:12.903,Code Red!
00:51:13.069,00:51:14.738,"I need total security lockdown, now!"
00:51:17.699,00:51:18.909,Om!
00:51:20.452,00:51:21.703,"'Sup, Joker?"
00:51:21.870,00:51:23.246,"Namaste, Batman."
00:51:23.413,00:51:24.873,-Namaste. -Gross.
00:51:25.040,00:51:26.500,"Ooh. Briefs man. Me, too."
00:51:26.666,00:51:28.794,"Cut the baloney. Kid, guard the door, will ya?"
00:51:28.960,00:51:30.086,"On it! Take that, Alan!"
00:51:30.378,00:51:33.673,Huh. Looks like you're going to a lot of trouble for little old me.
00:51:33.840,00:51:36.009,I must be your greatest enemy after all.
00:51:36.176,00:51:37.511,"Right, Batman?"
00:51:37.844,00:51:39.888,-I see what you're trying to do. -And what is that?
00:51:40.055,00:51:42.974,You're trying to entrap me into a relationship.
00:51:43.141,00:51:45.310,"-Really? -Yeah, and it's not gonna work."
00:51:45.477,00:51:46.686,"Oh, yes, it is."
00:51:49.231,00:51:50.357,"-No, you're not! -No, you're not!"
00:51:51.858,00:51:53.318,"-No, you didn't! -No, you didn't!"
00:51:55.320,00:51:57.447,"See? We aren't so different, I and you."
00:51:57.614,00:51:59.115,"-It's, you and I! -It's, you and I!"
00:51:59.533,00:52:01.952,-Argh! -Admit it. I'm your greatest enemy.
00:52:02.118,00:52:03.453,"You're not my greatest enemy, Joker."
00:52:03.620,00:52:05.872,"Okay, then send me to the Phantom Zone."
00:52:06.039,00:52:07.040,"Fine, I will."
00:52:07.207,00:52:09.751,And prove I'm your greatest enemy.
00:52:11.169,00:52:12.546,"Batman, don't do this."
00:52:12.712,00:52:18.051,"As long as you're in the Phantom Zone, I'll be saving Gotham City, and that's all that matters to me."
00:52:18.218,00:52:19.553,"Goodbye, Joker."
00:52:19.719,00:52:21.638,"Oh, Batman, thank you!"
00:52:24.057,00:52:27.435,Yes! That's what I call saving the city again!
00:52:27.602,00:52:29.312,"Batman, what are you doing?"
00:52:29.479,00:52:30.730,I'm Batman-ing.
00:52:32.107,00:52:36.361,I'm Batman I'm awesome I got a nine-pack Stop it!
00:52:36.736,00:52:38.238,"Batman, I can't believe you did this."
00:52:38.405,00:52:39.406,"Hi, police lady."
00:52:39.573,00:52:43.285,"And even worse, you've made this kid into an accessory to your crime."
00:52:44.411,00:52:45.495,"Sorry, kid."
00:52:45.662,00:52:46.663,"That's okay, ma'am."
00:52:46.830,00:52:50.208,"As long as I'm doing a dime in the big house with my old man, everything's gonna be A-okay."
00:52:50.375,00:52:52.460,"Officers, take this Projector to the evidence room."
00:52:52.627,00:52:54.296,-You got it. -And get this man some pants.
00:52:54.462,00:52:55.505,I'm good the way I am.
00:52:55.672,00:52:58.383,"B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet?"
00:53:03.430,00:53:05.932,"I wanted to be you, Batman."
00:53:06.474,00:53:11.313,I wanted to be as strong and as fast and as smart as Batman.
00:53:12.272,00:53:14.274,But you're not who I thought you were.
00:53:14.816,00:53:16.109,Uh... What do you mean?
00:53:17.152,00:53:20.447,You can't be a hero if you only care about yourself.
00:53:21.323,00:53:23.283,"Barbara, I..."
00:53:25.535,00:53:29.456,I think you're underestimating the importance of the Joker being in the Phantom Zone.
00:53:30.165,00:53:32.459,"Really, it's kind of a stroke of genius. All the..."
00:53:32.626,00:53:33.668,"Hey, where are you going?"
00:53:33.835,00:53:37.339,I just put Joker in the one place he can't do anyone any harm.
00:53:40.508,00:53:44.721,But what if you just gave Joker exactly what he wanted?
00:54:09.829,00:54:10.872,Oh!
00:54:13.833,00:54:14.834,Whoa!
00:54:15.043,00:54:17.462,Look at this place! Am I being too loud?
00:54:18.838,00:54:20.465,"-Hi! -Oh, my gosh!"
00:54:22.550,00:54:23.551,How about a warning next time?
00:54:23.718,00:54:25.053,"You're so right, and I am so wrong."
00:54:25.220,00:54:27.055,"Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy."
00:54:27.222,00:54:28.223,"Yeah, bad guy."
00:54:28.390,00:54:30.266,"-My name is Phyllis. -Oh, that was my grandma's name."
00:54:30.433,00:54:33.019,Now hold still while I scan you.
00:54:35.063,00:54:36.606,Trying to assess whether you are bad.
00:54:41.569,00:54:43.279,Ugh! Your whole thing screams bad guy.
00:54:43.613,00:54:45.699,"Oh, yeah. I'm a really bad person."
00:54:45.865,00:54:47.659,But with vulnerabilities.
00:54:50.036,00:54:52.831,"So, where do you keep all the other bad people in this place?"
00:54:53.206,00:54:54.791,They're standing right behind you.
00:54:57.293,00:54:58.336,"Hi there, guys."
00:54:58.503,00:54:59.838,Lovely to meet you all. I'm the...
00:55:00.005,00:55:01.840,"Oh, fist bump? There we... Handshake?"
00:55:04.217,00:55:05.635,Take a look at the new guy.
00:55:05.802,00:55:08.054,Guess they'll just let anybody in here.
00:55:08.221,00:55:09.639,"Oh, no, no, no. I'm very bad, too."
00:55:09.806,00:55:13.560,They just showed a video montage-- -Boring! -What?
00:55:13.727,00:55:15.353,-You're boring. -He looks delicious.
00:55:18.356,00:55:20.650,Stop with the violence for just a second!
00:55:20.817,00:55:24.112,What if I told you I could get you outta here?
00:55:25.572,00:55:26.573,"I'm sorry, what'd you just say?"
00:55:26.740,00:55:31.578,"That's right. I'm so bad, I got myself thrown into this heck-hole on purpose!"
00:55:31.745,00:55:32.787,I'm listening.
00:55:32.954,00:55:35.040,Count me interested.
00:55:35.206,00:55:39.419,"Look, everyone here knows what it's like to be hurt by a hero, don't they?"
00:55:39.586,00:55:41.546,"We've all been taken for granted, right?"
00:55:43.548,00:55:47.260,"Well, that's why I came to this space prison."
00:55:47.427,00:55:51.139,To recruit the universe's greatest-- -We'll do it! -I'm sorry?
00:55:51.306,00:55:57.270,You were going to say something about recruiting the universe's greatest villains to conquer a superhero.
00:55:57.437,00:55:59.022,"-Am I right? -Uh, yeah."
00:56:01.274,00:56:03.735,Really? Because I brought a PowerPoint-- Still boring!
00:56:03.902,00:56:05.153,Yeah. Just get on with it.
00:56:05.320,00:56:06.780,You want us to humiliate him?
00:56:06.946,00:56:07.989,I certainly do. Yes.
00:56:08.156,00:56:10.700,You want us to make him grovel at your feet?
00:56:10.867,00:56:12.744,I would like to see that very much!
00:56:15.246,00:56:16.456,"Well, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:56:16.623,00:56:20.126,You want us to make the rivers of Gotham City run red with his blood?
00:56:20.293,00:56:23.963,"Oh, that's-- Oh, no blood? How do you feel about lava?"
00:56:24.130,00:56:25.131,Yes! Lava.
00:56:28.968,00:56:32.889,"Over here. I don't want to be a downer, but how exactly are we going to get outta this place?"
00:56:33.056,00:56:35.975,"Oh, leave that to me."
00:56:37.977,00:56:41.981,but I'll be a lot happier when this Phantom Zone Projector is locked up tight.
00:56:43.483,00:56:44.692,"Going up, ma'am?"
00:56:44.859,00:56:47.987,No. You're going down!
00:56:51.491,00:56:53.660,I guess you're right. I am going up. Ding!
00:56:56.162,00:56:58.164,Here comes the...
00:56:58.331,00:57:00.834,Phantom Zone!
00:57:03.837,00:57:04.879,Huh?
00:57:06.673,00:57:08.007,I'm gonna go start looting.
00:57:11.636,00:57:15.932,The Clown Prince of Crime is back!
00:57:16.099,00:57:18.518,"Commissioner Gordon, you gotta take a look at this."
00:57:23.481,00:57:26.526,And I've come to finally take over the city.
00:57:26.693,00:57:32.699,"But in order to do that, I need to break my friends out of a giant, scary prison."
00:57:35.368,00:57:39.372,And I ain't talking about those rogue losers dressed in cosplay!
00:57:41.583,00:57:43.793,I'm talking about my new peeps!
00:57:43.960,00:57:45.420,And they're just like me.
00:57:45.712,00:57:48.256,The greatest villains you'll ever see.
00:57:48.423,00:57:49.966,You wanna meet them?
00:57:50.216,00:57:51.885,-No. -Too bad.
00:57:53.178,00:57:57.557,"He's evil, he's magic, and it's about to get tragic."
00:57:57.724,00:57:59.392,It's Voldemort.
00:57:59.559,00:58:00.810,Magic!
00:58:02.395,00:58:03.771,You are a fish.
00:58:03.938,00:58:04.939,You are a frog.
00:58:05.106,00:58:06.107,You are a fish frog.
00:58:09.027,00:58:10.653,with an eye for jewelry.
00:58:10.820,00:58:12.405,Give it up for Sauron!
00:58:22.248,00:58:23.666,It's King Kong!
00:58:23.833,00:58:25.043,"Come at me, Gotham!"
00:58:27.003,00:58:30.215,"Commissioner Gordon, these monsters, they're too powerful."
00:58:30.924,00:58:32.300,Can you contain them to downtown?
00:58:32.926,00:58:34.219,That's gonna be impossible.
00:58:34.385,00:58:36.095,Half the police force are fish!
00:58:36.262,00:58:38.765,Sergeant Jackson! Stop floppin' around!
00:58:41.100,00:58:42.310,Wicked Witch!
00:58:42.477,00:58:43.770,Medusa.
00:58:43.937,00:58:45.271,And British robots!
00:58:48.608,00:58:50.985,Hello? Bad guys?
00:58:54.948,00:58:58.076,"What a crew, huh? And they all work for me!"
00:58:58.243,00:59:01.955,"Who's the greatest villain of them all now, Batman?"
00:59:02.121,00:59:03.289,Still not you.
00:59:03.456,00:59:05.458,"Actually, this does look pretty terrifying, Bat-Dad."
00:59:06.793,00:59:08.294,Nice destruction all around.
00:59:08.461,00:59:09.462,Watch your step!
00:59:09.629,00:59:11.130,"Good work, guys!"
00:59:11.297,00:59:16.302,"Now, all that's left for me is to rub it in Batman's bat face."
00:59:16.469,00:59:21.766,"Hey, Sauron, doesn't your flaming eye have a unique ability to peer through time and space?"
00:59:21.975,00:59:24.143,"-Uh-huh. -Well, I need to find Batman."
00:59:24.310,00:59:25.853,Where's homeboy's man cave?
00:59:26.062,00:59:27.814,Hmm. Give me a second.
00:59:27.981,00:59:29.107,Scary noise.
00:59:29.274,00:59:30.900,It's beneath Wayne Manor!
00:59:31.109,00:59:32.110,"Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:59:32.277,00:59:33.278,Hold on a sec.
00:59:33.444,00:59:37.949,Are you trying to tell me that Bruce Wayne is Batman...
00:59:38.783,00:59:39.993,...'s roommate?
00:59:40.493,00:59:42.245,Uh... Yeah.
00:59:42.954,00:59:45.873,"Evil army, this way to the Batcave!"
00:59:50.336,00:59:51.337,Good grief!
01:00:04.058,01:00:05.393,"Hey, Batman!"
01:00:11.733,01:00:13.860,We're going to have to rename this the Butt-mobile.
01:00:15.945,01:00:17.071,"Hey, evil army."
01:00:17.238,01:00:18.656,I need Batman brought here.
01:00:18.823,01:00:20.158,Now go get him!
01:00:20.325,01:00:21.492,Joker out!
01:00:24.829,01:00:25.830,Uh...
01:00:25.997,01:00:27.081,Padre?
01:00:28.416,01:00:29.834,Do you ever get scared?
01:00:30.543,01:00:31.586,No.
01:00:32.503,01:00:35.715,"Yeah, that's what I figured, 'cause you're Batman."
01:00:42.138,01:00:45.558,"Hey, kid. You know who does get scared?"
01:00:46.934,01:00:48.269,Bruce Wayne.
01:00:48.436,01:00:50.229,-Really? -Yeah.
01:00:50.396,01:00:57.236,Bruno told me once that sometimes the only way to get out of a down moment is to start boxing.
01:00:57.737,01:01:01.240,"And by boxing, he meant beatboxing."
01:01:07.205,01:01:12.126,"Feel it, uh-huh Dick Grayson on the mic, go Oh. Um..."
01:01:17.924,01:01:20.051,"Oh, my gosh. This does make me feel better."
01:01:20.218,01:01:21.260,Okay. Shh. Batman solo.
01:01:23.763,01:01:25.098,Can I get a bat? Bat...
01:01:28.351,01:01:30.186,"Ha! The city needs me. Bang, bang, bang!"
01:01:30.353,01:01:31.396,Excuse me.
01:01:31.562,01:01:33.898,Can you get the commissioner and show her this?
01:01:34.065,01:01:36.275,-Batman. -Would you stop doing that?
01:01:36.776,01:01:38.653,I sent the Bat-Fax.
01:01:41.489,01:01:42.490,The city needs you.
01:01:42.657,01:01:43.783,Yes! Let me out.
01:01:43.950,01:01:46.786,I'm only going to let you out on one condition.
01:01:46.953,01:01:49.664,-Name it. -You can't do it by yourself.
01:01:52.417,01:01:53.793,Fine. Who am I working with?
01:01:53.960,01:01:56.421,SEAL Team Six? Fox Force Five? Suicide Squad?
01:01:56.587,01:01:58.673,No. Me.
01:01:58.840,01:01:59.841,"Oh, I wanna help, too!"
01:02:00.007,01:02:01.342,-And I shall join as well. -Whoa!
01:02:01.509,01:02:03.302,"Alfred Pennyworth at your service, ma'am."
01:02:03.469,01:02:05.054,"-How did you-- -Alfred, you gotta let me out of here."
01:02:05.221,01:02:08.307,"Sir, those creatures out there are unlike anything we've ever seen."
01:02:08.474,01:02:10.351,Speak for yourself. You don't know everything I've seen.
01:02:10.518,01:02:11.644,I haven't told you everything.
01:02:11.811,01:02:14.313,And you'll never be able to defeat them alone.
01:02:14.480,01:02:16.649,And it'll be more fun if we all do it together!
01:02:16.816,01:02:18.484,What's the worst thing that could happen?
01:02:18.901,01:02:20.486,What are you so afraid of?
01:02:20.653,01:02:22.488,The thing I'm most afraid of?
01:02:27.827,01:02:29.787,I gotta be honest with you. It's snake clowns.
01:02:29.954,01:02:31.164,"Yeah, that's not a thing."
01:02:31.330,01:02:32.749,"Well then, nothing."
01:02:32.957,01:02:35.168,-I'm not afraid of anything. -Okay.
01:02:37.503,01:02:39.005,"-Oh, I will. -Good."
01:02:39.172,01:02:41.466,Do you know what the B-A-T in Batman stands for?
01:02:41.632,01:02:43.801,-Not really. -Best At Teamwork.
01:02:43.968,01:02:46.345,Best At Teamwork Man is my full name.
01:02:46.512,01:02:48.347,Yay! We're going on a family trip.
01:02:48.514,01:02:50.057,This is not a family trip.
01:02:50.224,01:02:51.392,"I can wear my costume, too."
01:02:51.559,01:02:55.062,"Well, luckily for us, you left your costume back at the-- -Rip! -Oh!"
01:02:55.229,01:02:57.398,Nope. Under your clothes. That's perfect.
01:02:57.565,01:02:59.984,"-Rip! -Alfred, what are you doing?"
01:03:00.151,01:03:01.152,I miss the '60s.
01:03:01.319,01:03:02.528,"Hey, can Scarecrow help?"
01:03:04.363,01:03:06.574,Permit us to lend you assistance.
01:03:06.741,01:03:08.242,Yeah. Why don't we use these guys?
01:03:08.409,01:03:09.410,What am I gonna do?
01:03:09.577,01:03:11.370,Get a bunch of criminals together to fight the criminals?
01:03:11.537,01:03:12.955,That's a stupid idea.
01:03:16.751,01:03:18.544,"Okay, guys. Game plan."
01:03:18.711,01:03:20.880,Joker's taken the Projector -to Wayne Manor. -Wayne Manor.
01:03:21.047,01:03:22.381,"Right. Thanks, Batman."
01:03:22.548,01:03:23.549,-We need that Projector. -Projector.
01:03:23.716,01:03:25.885,Or there's no way -to blast these monsters... -Monsters.
01:03:26.052,01:03:27.386,-...back to the Phantom Zone. -Phantom Zone? Yep.
01:03:27.553,01:03:30.264,"Batman, I really don't need you to finish my-- -Sand castles. -No."
01:03:30.431,01:03:31.557,-Sister's homework. -No.
01:03:31.724,01:03:33.392,-Succulent something. -No.
01:03:33.893,01:03:34.936,Um... Everybody?
01:03:38.064,01:03:39.732,Get him!
01:03:39.899,01:03:41.067,"Okay, everyone, grab on to me."
01:03:47.490,01:03:48.741,We've gotta take cover!
01:03:48.950,01:03:49.951,Whoa!
01:03:50.326,01:03:52.745,-Joker has eyes on us. -Where?
01:03:52.912,01:03:56.374,"No! I mean, he literally has a giant eye on us."
01:03:56.541,01:03:58.251,I think that thing can see our every move!
01:03:58.417,01:03:59.544,Shaka-laka-lako.
01:03:59.794,01:04:03.214,"We've got to destroy it, or we'll never make it to Wayne Manor."
01:04:03.381,01:04:04.423,Uh... Bat-Dad?
01:04:04.632,01:04:06.008,I really think you should see this.
01:04:08.427,01:04:10.054,This building's not up to code!
01:04:22.066,01:04:23.234,Is that real lava?
01:04:24.944,01:04:25.945,I'm okay.
01:04:28.072,01:04:29.448,"All right, yeah. It's 100% lava."
01:04:31.450,01:04:33.494,"-Everyone, start throwing me bricks. -Right away, sir."
01:04:33.661,01:04:35.162,"-I need a 4x6. Come on, quick. -Here you go."
01:04:35.329,01:04:36.372,-I need an elbow. -Elbow.
01:04:43.296,01:04:44.297,Ow!
01:04:50.595,01:04:52.847,"Yes! I did it. Pretty cool, huh?"
01:04:54.682,01:04:57.101,Why did you build this thing with only one seat?
01:04:57.268,01:05:00.271,"'Cause last I checked, I only had one butt. What the..."
01:05:01.105,01:05:02.940,What have you done to Wayne Manor?
01:05:05.776,01:05:07.361,I found out one of your secrets.
01:05:07.612,01:05:10.114,"-Uh-oh. -What do we have here, Batman?"
01:05:10.323,01:05:12.408,It looks like a bunch of relationship comedies.
01:05:12.575,01:05:14.285,-What's that one? -Must Love Dogs.
01:05:14.452,01:05:15.494,Must love crying.
01:05:15.661,01:05:17.622,-Marley &amp; Me. -I love the ending.
01:05:17.788,01:05:20.458,Oh! Serendipity?
01:05:20.625,01:05:22.293,We have Serendipity? I love that movie!
01:05:24.378,01:05:27.673,you sure like movies about relationships!
01:05:27.840,01:05:28.883,Oh! And look what else I found!
01:05:29.508,01:05:31.510,All your wonderful toys.
01:05:33.971,01:05:37.725,Accio lightning storm!
01:05:50.863,01:05:52.281,Ugly monsters on our three.
01:05:53.991,01:05:55.660,"-Uh... Padre? -Not now, kid."
01:05:57.578,01:05:59.121,Kind of got my hands full.
01:06:00.957,01:06:02.959,I've got good tone. Firing.
01:06:06.921,01:06:08.673,"-Uh... Batman? -What's up, buddy?"
01:06:12.259,01:06:14.136,Uh... Your number two needs to go number one.
01:06:14.303,01:06:16.472,I thought I told you to go back at the prison.
01:06:16.639,01:06:18.391,"-I tried, but Bane was in there. -So?"
01:06:18.557,01:06:20.851,He had sort of a get out of this bathroom now vibe.
01:06:25.272,01:06:26.983,Can you hold it in like a big boy?
01:06:28.818,01:06:30.194,Not a big deal. Don't worry about it. It's fine.
01:06:34.198,01:06:35.449,Oh. Could live without it.
01:06:40.454,01:06:41.706,That I do need to fix.
01:06:41.914,01:06:44.000,Good news. Our bathroom problem is solved.
01:06:48.421,01:06:51.173,"Don't worry, Batman. You fix the Batwing, I'll fly."
01:06:51.340,01:06:52.842,"All good, Babs. I've got my autopilot on it."
01:06:56.303,01:06:59.598,"Exactly. All right, guys. Until I get back, rope's in charge."
01:07:00.349,01:07:01.392,"Thanks, rope."
01:07:03.978,01:07:06.772,"All right, let's see. Yes, the piston brake out here."
01:07:06.939,01:07:09.442,Jet engine brake in here and...
01:07:10.609,01:07:12.695,Get out of here. No. Give me... No! Stop it!
01:07:12.862,01:07:14.405,"Come on, Master Dick. We need to help him."
01:07:14.572,01:07:15.614,"I'm with you, Grandpa!"
01:07:15.740,01:07:16.907,Get off my Padre!
01:07:19.118,01:07:22.246,What are you two doing here? I told you to stay in the cockpit.
01:07:23.122,01:07:25.041,You disobeyed me. You're on a timeout.
01:07:25.207,01:07:26.834,"Batman, you're on a timeout."
01:07:27.001,01:07:29.253,"What? Alfred, you better un-timeout me right now!"
01:07:29.420,01:07:31.672,No. Not until you un-timeout Master Dick.
01:07:33.090,01:07:34.759,"Guys, you're all un-timeouted!"
01:07:34.925,01:07:35.926,We have incoming!
01:07:36.093,01:07:37.636,-Sir! Watch out for those... -What are you doing?
01:07:44.185,01:07:45.728,"Okay. Everybody, timeout off."
01:07:45.936,01:07:47.480,Whoo-hoo! I've been parented.
01:07:47.646,01:07:49.774,"-Batman, I can help you. -No. Protect the rope."
01:07:49.940,01:07:51.358,The rope is fine!
01:07:51.525,01:07:52.610,Save Master Dick!
01:07:52.777,01:07:55.404,I'm fine. I'll just do one of my gymnastics moves to...
01:07:57.031,01:07:58.115,No!
01:08:03.829,01:08:04.872,Dick...
01:08:08.584,01:08:09.752,Gotcha!
01:08:13.422,01:08:15.341,"Hold on, Alfred. I'm almost there!"
01:08:20.763,01:08:22.640,Alfred!
01:08:31.524,01:08:32.691,No.
01:08:37.363,01:08:38.864,No!
01:08:40.074,01:08:41.200,"Move over, rope."
01:08:43.369,01:08:44.537,Hold on!
01:09:00.678,01:09:01.804,"Barbara, did you see that?"
01:09:01.971,01:09:03.347,Batrope saved Alfred.
01:09:03.556,01:09:06.225,"Sick moves, rope. I never doubted you, bro."
01:09:08.561,01:09:09.812,Rope! You lied to me!
01:09:10.813,01:09:16.861,"Wait a minute. You mean, without you, Alfred would have been street meat?"
01:09:17.069,01:09:19.572,"Batman, trust us."
01:09:19.738,01:09:21.574,We can do this.
01:09:21.740,01:09:24.660,"-Yeah. I know Gymkata. -Sorry, what's that?"
01:09:24.827,01:09:26.453,It's a gymnastics-based martial art.
01:09:26.745,01:09:28.873,I can punch those '80s monsters off the plane.
01:09:29.081,01:09:30.332,Uh... Okay.
01:09:32.960,01:09:34.211,"Sir, I'll get them off our back."
01:09:34.378,01:09:36.005,I was a tail gunner for the Royal Air Force.
01:09:36.172,01:09:37.423,"Locked and loaded, sir!"
01:09:37.590,01:09:38.632,Good. Love that!
01:09:38.799,01:09:40.593,I got an idea. We're gonna change course.
01:09:40.759,01:09:42.928,I want you to fly straight into that flaming eyeball.
01:09:43.095,01:09:45.848,"-What? -Barbara, trust me."
01:09:46.557,01:09:48.726,All right. Let's do this.
01:10:00.404,01:10:02.364,-We've got his attention. -He's tracking us.
01:10:13.626,01:10:15.336,Eat dirt!
01:10:15.502,01:10:17.588,"Bob's your uncle, you ruddy duff cobblers!"
01:10:24.053,01:10:25.304,"Okay, Babs, this is it."
01:10:25.471,01:10:27.681,"Fly us straight into that eye, and wait for my signal."
01:10:27.848,01:10:28.933,Can it come now?
01:10:29.099,01:10:30.643,Can we make the signal thing happen?
01:10:30.809,01:10:31.810,Almost there.
01:10:31.977,01:10:33.854,Almost there!
01:10:37.608,01:10:38.651,"Hot, hot, hot!"
01:10:39.109,01:10:40.319,"Now! Barbara, dive bomb!"
01:10:55.125,01:10:56.585,Nothing to see.
01:11:03.259,01:11:04.301,Whoo-hoo!
01:11:04.468,01:11:06.720,"-Yes! That was so rad! -We did it, everyone!"
01:11:06.887,01:11:08.013,That was so great! Go team!
01:11:08.180,01:11:09.306,"Come on, let's hear it for us!"
01:11:10.849,01:11:11.850,I felt so jazzed!
01:11:11.976,01:11:13.185,I say jazzed!
01:11:13.352,01:11:15.437,"I gotta give it to you, Batman. That was awesome."
01:11:15.604,01:11:16.647,-Ha! And you were awesome. -Thanks.
01:11:17.147,01:11:18.357,-And you were awesome. -I love compliments!
01:11:18.482,01:11:20.234,"And you were awesome, and I was amazing."
01:11:20.401,01:11:22.152,"I'm not trying to make it about myself, obviously."
01:11:22.361,01:11:24.863,But I just wanna make sure that everyone gets a pat on the back.
01:11:25.030,01:11:26.448,-Because it feels good. -It does feel good.
01:11:26.615,01:11:30.160,"You had a good idea, you had a good idea, and you had a good idea, and I had a great idea."
01:11:30.369,01:11:32.579,"You know what, I think that collectively, I'm gonna add..."
01:11:35.749,01:11:36.917,-No way! -Yes!
01:11:37.084,01:11:38.168,"Man, that feels good."
01:11:40.004,01:11:41.880,"Let's take a photo! All right, everyone, squeeze together."
01:11:43.590,01:11:45.467,-Nice and close! -I gotta get my pump on.
01:11:45.634,01:11:46.635,"-It's worth it. -Okay, everybody in?"
01:11:48.053,01:11:49.638,"Everyone say, Bat Family!"
01:11:51.724,01:11:53.142,"Ooh, let's take a look!"
01:11:55.519,01:11:56.895,-Splendid. -Wow.
01:11:57.646,01:11:59.189,Didn't it turn out great?
01:12:00.024,01:12:02.276,"Hey, guys! It's my first family photo!"
01:12:32.222,01:12:33.599,"-Hey, Bat-Dad. -Oh!"
01:12:33.974,01:12:35.601,Whoa. What are you doing?
01:12:35.768,01:12:38.020,"I'm trying to give you a big, old H-U-G."
01:12:38.187,01:12:39.563,"Okay, just..."
01:12:41.065,01:12:42.983,"Batman, are you okay?"
01:12:45.527,01:12:51.367,We are just one big happy fraternity of people who did an awesome job together.
01:12:52.785,01:12:54.495,I can't think of any other way to put that.
01:12:54.661,01:12:56.914,"-Cool. -So, guys, listen up!"
01:12:57.081,01:13:01.043,Taking the Projector from the Joker is gonna be our most dangerous mission yet.
01:13:01.210,01:13:02.669,-A family battle mission! -Right.
01:13:02.836,01:13:08.300,"Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler, and maybe root around, see if you can find a few Vitaminwaters or something, and then we'll head out."
01:13:08.467,01:13:10.302,"-Right away, sir. -Anything for you, Padre."
01:13:15.391,01:13:17.184,I think I'll need snowshoes.
01:13:17.351,01:13:20.854,"Yeah, I don't think you'll need snowshoes, but could you grab that flashlight?"
01:13:21.021,01:13:22.106,-Batman? -Padre?
01:13:22.272,01:13:23.315,Sir?
01:13:23.482,01:13:25.943,"What are you doing? Hey, Batman."
01:13:26.110,01:13:27.403,"Please, wait!"
01:13:31.907,01:13:33.617,I'm locking in some coordinates now.
01:13:35.119,01:13:38.914,Take the Scuttler to the taco stand on the border of Gotham City and Blüdhaven.
01:13:40.499,01:13:44.753,I want you to get these guys a couple of chimichangas -and three Jarritos. -Sir!
01:13:44.920,01:13:48.132,And then keep them there until this whole attack on Gotham City blows over.
01:13:48.298,01:13:51.009,"Padre, please. Don't do this!"
01:13:51.176,01:13:53.178,"Batman, you need us!"
01:13:53.512,01:13:55.431,How many times I gotta tell you?
01:13:56.056,01:13:58.267,Batman works alone.
01:13:58.892,01:14:00.519,"No, we have to stick together."
01:14:01.895,01:14:03.021,Please.
01:14:03.147,01:14:04.815,"Now go on, Scuttler. Go!"
01:14:10.446,01:14:11.447,Just go.
01:14:12.990,01:14:14.450,"Scuttler, move out!"
01:14:44.229,01:14:45.772,Scanning for intruders.
01:14:50.319,01:14:51.820,What have you done to my...
01:14:51.987,01:14:53.572,Bruce Wayne's house?
01:14:53.697,01:14:56.492,You'd better hope he's a cool guy and doesn't go crazy.
01:14:56.658,01:14:58.327,What happened to all your friends?
01:14:58.494,01:15:01.705,I don't need friends. I don't need anyone to stop you.
01:15:08.879,01:15:14.218,"When I saw you working with your friend-family, I actually thought you'd changed."
01:15:14.968,01:15:16.011,"But, no."
01:15:21.058,01:15:23.769,You've run away from every other person in your life.
01:15:23.936,01:15:26.396,But I'm the one you're always chasing.
01:15:26.563,01:15:28.815,Is this about that stupid greatest enemy thing?
01:15:28.982,01:15:30.442,"No, it's not."
01:15:31.777,01:15:32.945,Not anymore.
01:15:37.157,01:15:40.577,"I think after 78 years, I deserve respect!"
01:15:40.744,01:15:42.538,That is right. Respect!
01:15:43.121,01:15:50.671,"Do you realize that you have never once said the words, I hate you, Joker?"
01:15:50.837,01:15:51.922,Not once.
01:15:52.089,01:15:55.217,"Well, I am starting to feel pretty annoyed with you right now."
01:15:55.384,01:15:56.426,That's for darn sure.
01:15:56.593,01:15:58.929,Annoyed is not the same thing!
01:15:59.596,01:16:01.557,"Listen, Batman."
01:16:02.099,01:16:03.809,I...
01:16:03.976,01:16:05.227,Hate you.
01:16:07.896,01:16:08.981,Now you say it.
01:16:11.108,01:16:12.150,"Me, too."
01:16:16.029,01:16:18.448,You won't. You won't change.
01:16:18.615,01:16:21.285,"'Cause you can't. You won't, and you can't."
01:16:23.245,01:16:25.289,"You know what, boo-boo? Just shut it down."
01:16:25.455,01:16:27.499,These diseased lunatics are right.
01:16:27.666,01:16:28.667,"Yes, we are!"
01:16:28.834,01:16:33.755,I am not gonna be part of a one-sided relationship any longer!
01:16:35.340,01:16:37.175,-You and I are done! -What is wrong with you?
01:16:37.342,01:16:38.343,I'm moving on!
01:16:38.510,01:16:39.636,That's ridiculous.
01:16:39.803,01:16:44.766,"And on my way out, I'm gonna blow up Gotham City!"
01:16:44.933,01:16:46.727,No. You're not serious.
01:16:46.893,01:16:47.978,Wingardium Leviosa!
01:16:48.645,01:16:49.771,No!
01:16:49.938,01:16:51.982,"You know what? For once, Batman, you're right."
01:16:52.149,01:16:54.359,I'm not your greatest enemy.
01:16:54.526,01:16:57.738,Your greatest enemy is you.
01:17:24.348,01:17:25.932,-Whoa. -Hi!
01:17:27.517,01:17:29.061,"Oh, I am so sorry."
01:17:29.227,01:17:30.562,"It was all my fault, I keep doing that."
01:17:30.729,01:17:32.939,"Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy."
01:17:34.524,01:17:35.525,I'm not a bad guy.
01:17:35.692,01:17:37.361,But you're all in black. You have a cape.
01:17:37.527,01:17:38.820,"And you wear a big, scary mask."
01:17:38.987,01:17:39.988,"Well, I'm not."
01:17:40.155,01:17:41.448,And you kicked me in the face.
01:17:41.615,01:17:43.492,"Listen, I'm Batman."
01:17:43.867,01:17:45.535,Oof! You even sound like a bad guy.
01:17:45.702,01:17:47.204,"I swear, I am a good guy."
01:17:47.371,01:17:49.122,"Okay, Mr. Batman."
01:17:49.289,01:17:50.957,Hold still while I scan you.
01:17:53.085,01:17:54.086,"Yes, sir?"
01:17:54.252,01:17:56.088,"-You're super nimble, right? -I sure am!"
01:17:56.254,01:17:58.256,And 110% expendable?
01:17:58.423,01:18:00.217,"I don't know what that means, but okay."
01:18:00.384,01:18:01.385,"-How'd I do, Dad? -Mediocre."
01:18:01.551,01:18:03.303,-Yes! -And don't call me Dad.
01:18:03.762,01:18:04.763,Sorry.
01:18:09.935,01:18:17.401,"But doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?"
01:18:17.734,01:18:19.569,"Listen, you don't have a family."
01:18:19.903,01:18:22.406,So what do you know about having a surrogate son?
01:18:27.869,01:18:29.913,We have to stick together.
01:18:30.664,01:18:31.748,Please.
01:18:39.840,01:18:41.091,No one does.
01:18:45.053,01:18:47.931,Huh. You're not a traditional bad guy.
01:18:48.765,01:18:51.226,"But you're not exactly a good guy, either."
01:18:54.813,01:18:55.856,What?
01:18:56.022,01:18:57.441,"Go on, Scuttler. Go."
01:18:57.607,01:18:59.109,"-Batman, no. No! -Don't do this!"
01:18:59.276,01:19:00.652,Abandoned? No.
01:19:00.819,01:19:02.404,"No, I was trying to protect them."
01:19:04.531,01:19:05.741,"Well, yeah."
01:19:06.908,01:19:09.411,Are they really the ones you're protecting?
01:19:16.710,01:19:18.795,Do you really want the man who made you to come to harm?
01:19:21.298,01:19:23.133,But he didn't say to not not rescue him.
01:19:23.300,01:19:24.593,What are they doing?
01:19:24.760,01:19:26.052,"Come on, guys. Let's hustle."
01:19:26.219,01:19:28.430,Gotham City's not gonna blow itself up.
01:19:29.431,01:19:31.016,"Well, hello!"
01:19:36.563,01:19:38.732,"'Puter, go to super-secret stealth mode."
01:19:41.985,01:19:43.737,-Hold on! -No!
01:19:43.904,01:19:47.324,"Evil buddies, those are my last three painful reminders of Batman."
01:19:47.491,01:19:48.909,Run!
01:19:49.075,01:19:50.368,"Come on, Alfred. This way."
01:19:50.535,01:19:51.787,"Wait, where's Dick?"
01:19:51.953,01:19:53.121,The little guy? He's over there.
01:19:54.748,01:19:55.999,What's he doing?
01:19:56.166,01:19:57.709,I've gotta save my family!
01:19:57.876,01:19:58.877,Just think.
01:19:59.044,01:20:01.004,-What would Batman do? -What?
01:20:01.171,01:20:04.132,I know. Not listen to anyone else. Be mean to people.
01:20:04.382,01:20:06.051,Destroy as much property as possible.
01:20:06.218,01:20:08.178,"Talk in a really low, gravelly voice."
01:20:08.345,01:20:09.888,And go it alone.
01:20:10.055,01:20:11.181,"Kid, don't do that."
01:20:12.933,01:20:13.934,Turbines to speed.
01:20:14.100,01:20:15.101,Don't do what I would do!
01:20:15.268,01:20:16.686,I never even taught you how to drive!
01:20:16.853,01:20:18.647,"Hold on a second, Brick Lady."
01:20:21.274,01:20:23.819,I can't let you go. My boss will be really mad at me.
01:20:23.985,01:20:27.531,Yeah. But I bet your boss would be happy if you were able to get all those bad guys back in here.
01:20:27.948,01:20:29.199,Hmm. She sure would.
01:20:29.366,01:20:31.743,Then let me try. Let me get down there and help them.
01:20:31.910,01:20:33.870,But haven't you tried that before?
01:20:38.416,01:20:41.044,You do the same thing over and over.
01:20:45.090,01:20:46.550,What's gonna change?
01:20:46.716,01:20:47.759,No!
01:20:49.636,01:20:51.471,I know what I need to do.
01:20:51.638,01:20:53.890,"Just give me 24 hours, and I'll come back."
01:20:54.808,01:20:56.226,Whoa!
01:20:56.434,01:20:58.228,You've gotta let me go down there and save them.
01:21:00.856,01:21:01.857,I'll do whatever you want.
01:21:05.485,01:21:06.486,Please.
01:21:06.653,01:21:08.572,"Okay, but I need all the bad guys locked up in here."
01:21:08.738,01:21:09.948,I promise.
01:21:12.409,01:21:14.578,And I mean all of them.
01:21:16.079,01:21:17.581,One of these buttons has to save my friends.
01:21:19.666,01:21:20.667,Self what?
01:21:22.043,01:21:23.753,-Master Dick! -No!
01:21:27.924,01:21:29.718,Look who's bat!
01:21:41.146,01:21:43.607,"Everyone okay? Dick, Alfred, Barbara."
01:21:43.773,01:21:45.775,"-Are you guys-- -We're fine, Batman."
01:21:48.570,01:22:04.294,"Listen, I just wanted to say that I'm really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really..."
01:22:05.462,01:22:07.047,s-s-s...
01:22:10.300,01:22:13.261,Soooo...
01:22:14.721,01:22:15.722,Sorry?
01:22:15.889,01:22:17.933,Yeah. Whoo! I did it!
01:22:21.061,01:22:23.313,I don't even know why you bothered coming back.
01:22:28.652,01:22:29.653,afraid.
01:22:30.654,01:22:31.821,What?
01:22:33.657,01:22:37.994,The reason I came back was the same reason I left you.
01:22:41.039,01:22:56.137,I was afraid of feeling the pain you feel when you lose someone close to you.
01:23:04.020,01:23:06.064,Gotham needs us.
01:23:06.606,01:23:09.734,So I came back to do this.
01:23:10.318,01:23:11.319,Flip.
01:23:12.946,01:23:14.781,Flip? What is that? I don't...
01:23:15.156,01:23:16.491,You gotta turn around.
01:23:18.493,01:23:21.037,I call it the Babs-Signal.
01:23:21.204,01:23:23.707,And I'm flipping the switch for you.
01:23:23.873,01:23:27.919,Because saving this city is too big a job for one person.
01:23:28.086,01:23:29.546,"Flip, flip."
01:23:34.426,01:23:36.761,"So, what do you say, Commish?"
01:23:36.928,01:23:39.556,Will you work with me?
01:23:40.098,01:23:41.850,I need your help.
01:23:43.226,01:23:45.061,I thought you'd never ask.
01:23:46.563,01:23:49.232,"I'm very, very proud of you, sir."
01:23:49.399,01:23:53.570,But there's still only four of us against Joker's entire army.
01:23:53.737,01:23:55.739,That's why I called in some backup.
01:23:55.905,01:23:57.907,Flip! Flip! Flip! Flip!
01:24:01.536,01:24:02.537,and we came to help.
01:24:02.912,01:24:05.582,"Joker may be done with us, but we're not done with him."
01:24:05.749,01:24:07.917,We will be the Joker's reckoning.
01:24:08.084,01:24:10.086,Joker said mean stuff to us.
01:24:10.462,01:24:12.088,"You were right, Barbara."
01:24:12.255,01:24:14.966,It takes a village. Not a Batman.
01:24:17.552,01:24:19.429,"Okay. Everybody, listen up."
01:24:19.596,01:24:23.308,These monsters want to destroy Gotham City.
01:24:27.937,01:24:30.440,Costumes that suit our individual personalities.
01:24:30.607,01:24:31.608,Rip!
01:24:31.775,01:24:33.902,And code names to use on our walkie-talkies.
01:24:34.069,01:24:35.070,Call it out!
01:24:35.236,01:24:36.529,Your name is Lady Bat.
01:24:41.034,01:24:42.619,How about a cool costume?
01:24:42.786,01:24:43.787,Nice!
01:24:43.995,01:24:45.371,That one's called Batgirl.
01:24:45.538,01:24:47.624,"If you call me Batgirl, can I call you Batboy?"
01:24:47.791,01:24:51.961,"And lastly, a coordinated attack strategy, and a kick-butt theme song!"
01:24:52.128,01:24:53.129,Robin?
01:24:55.632,01:24:56.883,"Oh, yeah. Hit it!"
01:24:57.050,01:24:58.051,Got it!
01:25:05.767,01:25:06.810,Absolutely not.
01:25:09.813,01:25:12.941,This music is filling me with rage.
01:25:13.108,01:25:14.484,Let's use it!
01:25:15.944,01:25:18.071,"All right, team. I'm going to need to know your special powers."
01:25:18.238,01:25:19.239,I'm a giant clay person!
01:25:19.405,01:25:21.074,-I'm irritating. -I have a sack for a face.
01:25:21.241,01:25:22.325,I make unpredictable decisions.
01:25:22.492,01:25:23.493,I raise the stakes!
01:25:23.660,01:25:24.953,I can squirt ketchup!
01:25:25.120,01:25:26.538,Nice! Orca.
01:25:26.704,01:25:28.289,I'm a whale!
01:25:28.456,01:25:29.916,"Oh, we got this covered!"
01:25:30.083,01:25:31.126,Go team!
01:25:33.962,01:25:34.963,"Whale, yeah!"
01:25:38.174,01:25:39.926,Shh. Quiet.
01:25:40.093,01:25:42.137,Who's laying down those funky beats?
01:25:44.556,01:25:45.849,Batman?
01:25:46.015,01:25:47.809,"Evil army, get rid of them!"
01:25:48.685,01:25:51.437,"Team Gotham Family, activate!"
01:25:51.604,01:25:52.689,Voldy's got this.
01:25:57.360,01:25:58.695,Yeah!
01:26:02.157,01:26:03.491,Smash! Smash! Smash!
01:26:06.327,01:26:09.122,"-Whoa. -Batman, take out Joker's bomb."
01:26:09.289,01:26:10.874,I'll get that Projector!
01:26:13.459,01:26:15.503,"Freeze, Clayface, take this guy out!"
01:26:15.879,01:26:17.797,Coming through!
01:26:22.260,01:26:23.803,"Okay, Alfred, bring the pain."
01:26:25.722,01:26:28.725,"Bringing it, sir. For Queen and country!"
01:26:30.643,01:26:32.103,You just got Union Jacked!
01:26:34.772,01:26:35.857,"Robin, get ready."
01:26:36.024,01:26:37.942,I'm about to teach you some father-and-son stuff.
01:26:38.735,01:26:40.111,"First, driving."
01:26:40.278,01:26:42.071,-Put your hands at 10 and 2. -Okay.
01:26:42.238,01:26:44.866,"Now, fly! Turn left!"
01:26:45.700,01:26:47.076,Run over these skeletons.
01:26:47.243,01:26:48.578,Now drive up the wall!
01:26:50.079,01:26:51.915,"-Great driving. -Thanks, Padre."
01:26:53.416,01:26:54.417,Yeah!
01:26:55.585,01:26:56.669,"Okay, Robin."
01:26:56.836,01:27:03.593,"Together, we're gonna punch these guys so hard, words describing the impact are gonna spontaneously materialize out of thin air."
01:27:03.760,01:27:04.886,Yeah!
01:27:10.183,01:27:11.517,Yes! Yes! Yes!
01:27:15.271,01:27:16.231,High five!
01:27:16.564,01:27:18.691,"Stop moving around, you Muggles."
01:27:18.900,01:27:21.027,"All right, team, let's shut him down."
01:27:24.364,01:27:26.199,You wanna see a magic trick?
01:27:26.366,01:27:28.159,I'm gonna make you disappear.
01:27:28.326,01:27:31.079,-Wingardium Levio... -Me-yoink!
01:27:31.246,01:27:33.164,Wingardium Levio... Shut up!
01:27:33.331,01:27:34.332,No!
01:27:34.499,01:27:36.125,"Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!"
01:27:36.292,01:27:37.293,Fudgecake!
01:27:39.796,01:27:41.172,"Batman, think fast!"
01:27:44.300,01:27:46.052,"Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!"
01:27:46.219,01:27:47.220,"Robin, go long."
01:27:47.387,01:27:49.264,-Nice grab. -Yeah!
01:27:53.226,01:27:54.227,"Here you go, Grandpa."
01:27:56.271,01:27:57.272,"Hey, Batman!"
01:28:00.817,01:28:02.777,Get off my padre!
01:28:04.070,01:28:05.863,It wasn't useless after all.
01:28:06.030,01:28:07.699,"End this, Batgirl!"
01:28:10.243,01:28:12.161,"Adiós, shark."
01:28:13.746,01:28:31.264,"Okay, BRB, guys. I'm gonna go defuse that-- This is the end of Gotham City!"
01:28:32.557,01:28:34.976,"As I predicted, we're doomed!"
01:28:36.352,01:28:38.021,We're not doomed. I got this.
01:28:39.564,01:28:40.815,"Everyone, grab on to me."
01:28:40.982,01:28:42.108,Gotcha.
01:28:42.275,01:28:44.861,"Come on, guys. We need to hold this city together."
01:28:47.363,01:28:48.614,"Batrope, no!"
01:28:48.781,01:28:50.408,"Everybody, run!"
01:28:50.575,01:28:52.577,No! We have to stick together.
01:28:52.744,01:28:53.745,"Right, Batman?"
01:28:53.911,01:28:55.204,We need to use our heads!
01:28:55.371,01:28:56.914,Maybe we should build something together.
01:29:05.423,01:29:06.466,I got it.
01:29:06.632,01:29:09.552,"You're right, Babs. We need to stick together."
01:29:09.719,01:29:11.054,Literally.
01:29:11.220,01:29:12.430,"Robin, quick. Give me a boost."
01:29:12.597,01:29:13.598,"On it, Padre."
01:29:13.765,01:29:18.353,"We're gonna stick together, using our heads, and the most powerful weapon of all."
01:29:18.519,01:29:20.938,Shredded abs. Let's do this.
01:29:22.523,01:29:23.733,-Ready? -Here we go.
01:29:23.900,01:29:24.942,"You got this, Alfred?"
01:29:25.109,01:29:26.861,"Yes, sir. Abs of steel."
01:29:27.028,01:29:31.407,"Great! Now you bend, and I'll grab the other side!"
01:29:32.325,01:29:33.368,No!
01:29:39.665,01:29:40.666,Joker!
01:29:40.833,01:29:42.835,"Please, help us!"
01:29:43.002,01:29:44.587,No! I'm not gonna help you.
01:29:44.754,01:29:50.468,"At least if this city is destroyed, I'll die knowing I'm your greatest enemy!"
01:29:50.635,01:29:52.678,I'm gonna have to die to know it.
01:29:52.845,01:29:58.184,"Shut up, Joker! If there's no Gotham, then I'll never get to fight you again."
01:29:59.310,01:30:00.603,What?
01:30:01.479,01:30:06.609,You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.
01:30:07.193,01:30:11.823,You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.
01:30:12.448,01:30:17.245,"And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people."
01:30:18.246,01:30:19.247,And you.
01:30:21.040,01:30:27.588,"So if you help me save Gotham, you'll help me save us."
01:30:28.589,01:30:30.883,You just said us.
01:30:31.050,01:30:35.138,Yeah. Batman and the Joker.
01:30:36.973,01:30:38.641,What do you say?
01:30:39.475,01:30:41.477,You had me at shut up.
01:30:43.354,01:30:44.647,"How are your abs, bro?"
01:30:48.192,01:30:49.944,Because I need you to crunch them.
01:30:50.319,01:30:56.701,"Citizens of Gotham, we need all of you to join us and help bring this city back together."
01:31:22.894,01:31:25.021,I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
01:31:27.773,01:31:29.650,"-I hate you, too. -I hate you more."
01:31:29.817,01:31:31.527,I hate you the most.
01:31:31.694,01:31:33.529,I hate you forever.
01:31:34.071,01:31:35.114,Splendid!
01:31:36.782,01:31:37.950,"We did it, everyone!"
01:31:51.881,01:31:53.007,where are you going?
01:31:54.133,01:31:55.718,I made a promise.
01:31:55.885,01:31:57.845,I gotta go back to the Phantom Zone.
01:31:58.888,01:31:59.972,"Sorry, kid."
01:32:00.139,01:32:02.058,"Padre, please."
01:32:02.225,01:32:04.227,Don't call me Padre.
01:32:04.769,01:32:06.187,Okay.
01:32:06.729,01:32:07.855,Call me...
01:32:11.901,01:32:13.069,Dads.
01:32:18.074,01:32:20.785,But they're both leaving.
01:32:21.953,01:32:23.579,"It's gonna be okay, kid."
01:32:25.164,01:32:27.667,"Sometimes, losing people is part of life."
01:32:28.501,01:32:31.420,But that doesn't mean you stop letting them in.
01:32:32.171,01:32:35.091,Some very wise people taught me that.
01:32:35.967,01:32:37.468,My father figure.
01:32:39.011,01:32:44.267,"My platonic coworker buddy, who's a girl, but just a friend."
01:32:45.935,01:32:47.144,And you.
01:32:47.937,01:32:49.272,Mi hijo.
01:32:49.939,01:32:53.484,It's Spanish for son.
01:32:55.611,01:33:00.491,"This is my family, but it's your family, too."
01:34:04.889,01:34:06.140,Do you have a knife?
01:34:06.307,01:34:07.308,Why?
01:34:07.475,01:34:11.020,'Cause someone needs to cut the tension between the two of us immediately.
01:34:12.355,01:34:13.856,Okay. I deserved that.
01:34:15.566,01:34:16.609,What's going on?
01:34:16.776,01:34:19.111,"I came back, just like I said I would."
01:34:21.072,01:34:26.243,"When you're a talking brick, working at the Phantom Zone, you see a lot of crazy things."
01:34:26.410,01:34:33.209,"But I've finally seen a man, in order to make the world a better place, take a look at himself and make a change."
01:34:34.251,01:34:35.252,Who?
01:34:35.628,01:34:37.546,-Superman. -What?
01:34:37.713,01:34:38.964,I'm kidding. It's you.
01:34:42.426,01:34:44.720,"Well, I guess I'll be seeing you on the streets, Batman."
01:34:44.887,01:34:46.889,"I guess so. Catch you later, Joker."
01:34:47.056,01:34:48.224,"Let's go, gang."
01:34:49.809,01:34:51.894,"we're not just gonna let these criminals go, right?"
01:34:52.061,01:34:53.604,"Ah, come on, Commish. Let's face it."
01:34:53.771,01:34:55.731,Those guys are no match for the four of us.
01:34:55.898,01:34:57.566,We'll give them a 30-minute head start.
01:34:57.733,01:35:00.277,"Besides, you can't fight crime on an empty stomach."
01:35:03.239,01:35:04.448,"Hey, Computer?"
01:35:24.593,01:35:27.430,"When Dad and me were fighting, I was giving them my best one-liners."
01:35:28.305,01:35:32.768,You complete me.
01:35:46.323,01:35:49.368,"Holy family photo, Batman. I love it!"
01:35:57.626,01:36:01.797,All important movies end with a white screen.
01:36:02.339,01:36:04.467,And tying up loose ends.
01:36:04.633,01:36:06.677,"We're coming for you, Gotham City!"
01:36:30.659,01:36:33.871,The kind that makes parents and studio executives happy.
01:36:57.895,01:36:58.896,"Come on, everyone!"
01:37:18.290,01:37:19.625,"-Come on, Batman! -No!"
01:38:49.548,01:38:51.925,Really hope nobody was recording that.
01:38:52.092,01:38:54.637,"Let me see. Oh, this thing is on. This thing is recording."
