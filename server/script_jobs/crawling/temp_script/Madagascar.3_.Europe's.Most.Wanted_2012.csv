00:01:00.269,00:01:01.186,-Buh-bye! -Goodbye.
00:01:01.270,00:01:03.230,All right! We'll be waiting for ya!
00:01:03.522,00:01:06.441,Just kidding! We're never coming back!
00:01:06.650,00:01:07.651,Sorry! What was that?
00:01:13.615,00:01:15.617,Did they just say they were never coming back?
00:01:17.703,00:01:18.620,Guys?
00:01:27.671,00:01:29.840,"I'm hungry. Nom, nom, nom, nom."
00:01:34.428,00:01:36.054,I'm just messing with ya.
00:01:36.346,00:01:38.932,I lost all feeling in this thing years ago.
00:01:45.564,00:01:48.900,Gloria? Why are you guys so elderly?
00:01:49.026,00:01:51.570,"Now, when was the last time you looked in the mirror?"
00:01:51.695,00:01:52.571,What?
00:01:54.156,00:01:56.867,"-No! -Wake up! Wake up, Ally-Al!"
00:02:01.538,00:02:07.336,"We were stuck here in Africa and we were all super-old and wrinkly and… well, I aged well, but the rest of you looked terrible!"
00:02:07.419,00:02:10.589,"Relax, Alex. 'Cause I got a surprise for you!"
00:02:13.383,00:02:15.969,Nope. But it's the next best thing.
00:02:21.058,00:02:22.225,"-Sorry, little incline there. -Oh."
00:02:25.228,00:02:38.533,"Low-hanging branch, Whoa."
00:02:41.995,00:02:44.331,Wow! New York City.
00:02:45.123,00:02:46.208,-Surprise! -Surprise!
00:02:50.253,00:02:52.172,"Bring me your huddled masses, baby!"
00:02:52.255,00:02:54.716,"And, Melman, you're the Brooklyn Bridge!"
00:02:55.008,00:02:56.760,"Actually, I'm the Triborough Bridge."
00:02:56.927,00:02:59.179,Wow! You guys made this?
00:02:59.721,00:03:03.308,"Yeah. From memory. From crazy, obsessive memory."
00:03:08.397,00:03:11.858,"There's Times Square, with its modern-day corporate lack of character."
00:03:13.068,00:03:14.945,Nine Duane Reades on the same street!
00:03:17.698,00:03:18.657,And the zoo.
00:03:19.658,00:03:20.826,"Wow, our home."
00:03:21.827,00:03:23.245,Look! There's a little me.
00:03:24.037,00:03:25.580,And little all of us-es.
00:03:36.216,00:03:38.468,Roar!
00:04:03.368,00:04:06.705,You guys. You've both made and ruined my day.
00:04:12.294,00:04:15.213,Tada! Your wish has come true.
00:04:17.215,00:04:19.384,My tummy is speaking to me.
00:04:21.344,00:04:24.014,"Uh, I wouldn't eat that side of the cake, if I were you."
00:04:25.432,00:04:27.017,"Alex, what was your wish?"
00:04:27.267,00:04:30.020,"I wished we could go home. I mean, don't get me wrong."
00:04:30.145,00:04:32.647,I love this. But it's not the real thing.
00:04:32.856,00:04:35.442,"Well, that's because it's a mud model, Alex."
00:04:35.776,00:04:38.153,It's not actually New York. I hope that was clear.
00:04:38.278,00:04:39.321,What are we doing?
00:04:39.946,00:04:42.449,Here we are relying on the penguins to come back for us.
00:04:42.824,00:04:46.286,But… we should just go to Monte Carlo and get them.
00:04:46.536,00:04:51.166,"How do a lion, a zebra, a giraffe, and a hippo walk into a casino in Monte Carlo?"
00:04:51.500,00:04:53.502,I don't know. Ask the rabbi!
00:04:53.585,00:04:55.670,"-Hey, I'm serious. -Come on, we can do it!"
00:04:56.004,00:04:58.423,-We can do anything. It's us! -We're us!
00:04:58.548,00:05:00.926,"Yeah, that's right. We've gone halfway around the world."
00:05:01.259,00:05:05.222,"Compared with that, Monte Carlo's just a hop, skip, and a swim away."
00:05:06.431,00:05:07.307,To home.
00:05:10.519,00:05:13.271,"Tell you what, bet those penguins will be glad to see us."
00:05:13.605,00:05:15.774,"Yeah, they're probably bored out of their minds."
00:05:29.996,00:05:33.083,You pillow fight like a bunch of little girls!
00:05:34.751,00:05:38.588,Chimichanga! These pillows are filled with baby birds!
00:06:08.326,00:06:10.787,"-What? -There it is, the casino."
00:06:14.457,00:06:16.918,"I said, Perfect. That's where we'll find the penguins."
00:06:22.090,00:06:23.592,"Shh! Come on, guys."
00:06:23.758,00:06:26.428,Operation Penguin Extraction does not include levity.
00:06:26.678,00:06:28.346,We can't draw attention to ourselves.
00:06:28.638,00:06:30.181,We're invisible!
00:06:30.932,00:06:32.809,"I'm talking really, really quiet."
00:06:51.369,00:06:54.247,and get them to take us back to New York in the Monkey-Powered Super Plane!
00:06:55.332,00:06:58.960,"Phase two, we chew out the penguins for abandoning us in Africa."
00:06:59.085,00:07:09.888,"-Check. -Phase three, we apologize to the penguins for overly harsh chewing outing, but… Phase four, back to New York City."
00:07:10.096,00:07:11.222,-Yes! -I like it.
00:07:13.558,00:07:17.687,"All right, we take these ventilation ducts to the crawlspace above the casino, where we find the penguins."
00:07:17.938,00:07:20.899,We just need to figure out which duct each of us should take.
00:07:50.971,00:07:51.846,"Oh, no!"
00:07:59.104,00:08:01.564,"Okay, okay. I got you. I got you, honey."
00:08:08.738,00:08:13.952,"Now, they're not gonna let animals on to the casino floor, so, expect some kind of disguise."
00:08:20.083,00:08:21.584,That is roach-killing ugly.
00:08:24.170,00:08:28.633,"And that's not the King of Versailles, that's the chimps. And the chimps are like smoke."
00:08:28.925,00:08:32.220,"And where there's smoke, there's fire. And by fire, I mean the penguins!"
00:08:36.850,00:08:40.395,Then we'll pick up the hippies and fly back to New York in style.
00:08:40.520,00:08:43.648,"-Can we buy an Airbus A-380? -Solid gold, baby."
00:08:43.857,00:08:46.109,Sir! A solid gold plane wouldn't be able to fly.
00:08:46.192,00:08:49.362,"Kowalski, we'll be rich! The rules of physics don't apply to us."
00:08:49.487,00:08:51.364,-Let it ride! -Right-o!
00:08:53.742,00:08:58.204,"Okay. In exactly two minutes and 17 seconds, the lemurs will cut the power."
00:08:58.455,00:08:59.330,-Now? -No.
00:08:59.622,00:09:00.498,-Okay? -No.
00:09:00.623,00:09:01.541,-Now? -No.
00:09:01.624,00:09:04.919,"I drop down, grab the penguins. You crank me up, and we are out of here."
00:09:05.003,00:09:07.380,"Oh, oh, oh! Let-- Let me drop down! I'll grab the penguins."
00:09:07.547,00:09:08.757,"You don't have fingers, Marty."
00:09:08.882,00:09:10.592,-Now? Do it? -No. No!
00:09:10.675,00:09:12.052,These are things a leader has to think of.
00:09:12.135,00:09:14.054,Why should you be the leader? Why-- Why not me?
00:09:14.179,00:09:15.930,'Cause I'm the phase tracker!
00:09:21.728,00:09:24.564,"A phase isn't something you own, -it's something you're in. -That's it."
00:09:25.815,00:09:28.193,"Who voted you, Grand Phase Master, anyway?"
00:09:28.276,00:09:29.652,Me! I voted me! 'Cause I'm the leader.
00:09:31.780,00:09:32.655,-Now? -No!
00:09:35.825,00:09:37.577,-Maybe I should be in charge. -Melman!
00:09:37.744,00:09:38.703,I am a doctor.
00:09:38.828,00:09:39.704,-Now? -No.
00:09:39.829,00:09:42.832,-Why can't we all be lead-- -Enough! I'm gonna lead.
00:10:02.185,00:10:03.812,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
00:10:03.978,00:10:05.146,"Marty, what phase are we at?"
00:10:05.313,00:10:07.357,"Uh, phase three, apologize!"
00:10:07.482,00:10:09.526,"Right. Oh, man, we are so sorry."
00:10:09.734,00:10:12.570,"Well, apology accepted. Let's roll."
00:10:13.154,00:10:15.490,"Marty, we skipped phase two. We didn't chew them out."
00:10:15.615,00:10:17.742,Don't look at me. I'm just following the leader!
00:10:19.244,00:10:21.329,-Now! -I'm a bit busy right now.
00:10:21.663,00:10:22.997,Just pull the switch!
00:10:31.881,00:10:33.675,What the heck is going on with the lights?
00:10:41.057,00:10:41.933,Come on!
00:10:47.564,00:10:48.481,Initiate lockdown!
00:10:48.982,00:10:51.901,And get me Captain DuBois from Animal Control!
00:11:10.003,00:11:16.759,"When I was seven, I strangled my first parrot, flushed my first goldfish, punched my first snake."
00:11:19.888,00:11:21.723,I have been preparing for my entire life.
00:11:22.599,00:11:27.312,"The pinnacle of my career, to hunt the king of the beasts!"
00:11:41.910,00:11:43.578,"-Oh, no. -Lockdown, eh?"
00:11:43.661,00:11:44.621,What do we do?
00:11:44.704,00:11:48.166,"All right, everybody, stand back. I got this one."
00:11:54.172,00:11:56.633,"Well, you only get one chance at a first impression."
00:12:04.140,00:12:06.267,-What just happened? -Where are we? What is this?
00:12:06.392,00:12:09.187,We call it the Luxury Assault Recreational Vehicle.
00:12:11.272,00:12:12.398,"Step on it, boys!"
00:12:50.311,00:12:57.735,"Captain DuBois, I am so happy to see you. You will not believe-- Get back, you fool! Your cheap cologne is obscuring the animal musk."
00:12:57.819,00:12:58.736,"Oh, my face."
00:13:18.423,00:13:22.176,"You should never have left the forest. Now, you deal with me."
00:13:25.596,00:13:29.475,"Kowalski, signal the chimps to meet us at the rendezvous point with the Super Plane."
00:13:33.479,00:13:34.480,Yeah-- Ow!
00:13:38.401,00:13:40.361,Voilà. Giraffe at twelve o'clock.
00:13:41.821,00:13:42.989,"Guys, we've got a tail."
00:13:43.364,00:13:44.574,Paparazzi!
00:13:44.991,00:13:46.409,"Pedal to the metal, Private."
00:14:06.888,00:14:09.891,"-ETA to rendezvous point? -Two minutes, 37 seconds, sir."
00:14:10.016,00:14:11.225,Man your battle stations.
00:14:12.352,00:14:14.645,Hey! Wait! Nobody's at the wheel.
00:14:22.403,00:14:25.114,"Don't just sit there, fancy pants. Grab the wheel."
00:14:25.198,00:14:27.158,Are you kidding? I don't drive. I'm a New Yorker!
00:14:27.283,00:14:28.409,"Move over, Miss Daisy!"
00:14:28.534,00:14:31.871,What are you doing? Zebras can't drive! Only penguins and people can drive.
00:14:37.585,00:14:38.628,"Nice one, Stripes."
00:14:47.929,00:14:50.223,Our Omega-3 slick will take 'em down.
00:14:50.390,00:14:51.599,"Private, activate!"
00:15:05.446,00:15:06.572,She's good.
00:15:12.537,00:15:15.581,Monaco Animal Control. Perfect case record.
00:15:21.587,00:15:24.715,"-You're going the wrong way, Marty! -Just call me Marty-o Andretti."
00:15:35.726,00:15:36.978,Don't look at me when we argue!
00:15:37.145,00:15:38.729,"-Look at the road! -Be cool, be cool."
00:15:41.941,00:15:42.859,Hi.
00:15:53.911,00:15:57.290,Time to fire up Kowalski's nucular reactor.
00:15:57.415,00:15:59.750,-That's a nuclear reactor? -Nucular.
00:16:03.254,00:16:04.964,The control rods will have to be calibrated.
00:16:05.047,00:16:07.049,And don't even ask me about the Uranium-238 blanket.
00:16:07.133,00:16:08.050,Okay.
00:16:14.682,00:16:18.019,"Okay, Marty, we lost her. Maybe you can slow down now."
00:16:18.144,00:16:19.562,I can't! There's no brakes.
00:16:19.854,00:16:23.149,"No brakes? Well, way to commit, soldier."
00:16:46.214,00:16:47.298,Let's get out of here!
00:16:49.509,00:16:51.344,"Hey, where's everybody going?"
00:17:05.149,00:17:09.445,"I'm flying, I'm the first flying monkey!"
00:17:11.364,00:17:12.532,"Oh, yay!"
00:17:12.865,00:17:14.116,That's our ticket out of here!
00:17:14.325,00:17:15.368,Ah!
00:17:15.618,00:17:17.036,"-Yeah, baby! -Yeah!"
00:17:42.520,00:17:44.105,"Everybody, on the monkey chain."
00:17:46.023,00:17:46.983,Deploy banana gun!
00:18:06.961,00:18:09.338,Faster! Faster! Faster! Come on!
00:18:19.890,00:18:20.766,Melman!
00:18:28.357,00:18:31.444,Put your backs into it! Double banana overtime!
00:18:38.451,00:18:39.327,"Oh, no!"
00:18:39.452,00:18:40.953,Serpentine! Serpentine!
00:19:05.227,00:19:07.897,"Hey, this lady's really starting to freak me out."
00:19:18.866,00:19:21.410,"Alex, be careful! She's crazy!"
00:19:21.786,00:19:22.953,"You think, Marty?"
00:19:42.431,00:19:43.683,"Well played, lion."
00:19:44.600,00:19:45.726,Game on.
00:19:57.655,00:19:59.573,"Kowalski, status report."
00:19:59.824,00:20:02.410,"Well, the good news is, this song is almost over."
00:20:02.743,00:20:05.996,"Well, that's music to my ears. And the bad news?"
00:20:06.205,00:20:08.207,"The gear assembly is badly damaged, sir."
00:20:11.293,00:20:45.453,"It's only a matter of time before… Skipper, what about the plane?"
00:20:45.870,00:20:47.371,"Well, the chimps will work through the night."
00:20:47.455,00:20:49.290,"No breaks, no safety restrictions."
00:20:52.668,00:20:54.503,Get back here! We have a contract!
00:20:54.670,00:20:58.132,"Yes. Well, I'm afraid labor laws are slightly more lenient in France."
00:20:58.507,00:21:00.843,"You see, they only have to work, two weeks a year."
00:21:01.218,00:21:03.679,"Well, someone else has the Canadian work ethic."
00:21:03.888,00:21:06.390,"But you penguins, you can still fix it, right? Right?"
00:21:06.557,00:21:08.934,"Yeah, yeah. You're a little crackerjack, can-do team."
00:21:09.101,00:21:10.728,You want me to give it to you straight?
00:21:10.936,00:21:12.605,Yes! Yes! No.
00:21:13.606,00:21:14.523,Bend it a little?
00:21:14.690,00:21:17.860,"Well, the plane's totaled. Kaput, blammo, busted!"
00:21:18.319,00:21:19.862,Never to fly again.
00:21:20.321,00:21:23.157,"So that's it? That's it then, we-- we're never gonna get home?"
00:21:23.240,00:21:24.700,No! We gotta get home!
00:21:25.701,00:21:28.704,"We can fix it. We'll fix it! Yeah, guys, come on, we'll fix it."
00:21:28.913,00:21:31.415,"You just start from the outside pieces, and you work your way in."
00:21:33.459,00:21:36.504,"Come on! Don't just stand there, guys. Marty! Drag that thingy over here."
00:21:36.629,00:21:39.590,And we'll just attach it to this little -dealy-bob over here. -Alex!
00:21:49.016,00:21:50.476,We're never going home.
00:21:55.898,00:21:56.816,It's the fuzz!
00:22:05.366,00:22:07.576,And we can't just blend. You know this ain't Africa.
00:22:07.660,00:22:09.203,"Oh, what's the point?"
00:22:09.787,00:22:17.294,Tell me one conceivable way that extra-large animals like us are gonna be able to move through Europe without attracting unwanted attention.
00:22:20.673,00:22:25.636,Hey… Where are you coming from?
00:22:25.886,00:22:29.139,"Please, you got to hide us. Just until the heat dies down."
00:22:29.431,00:22:30.891,Absolut no outsiders.
00:22:31.183,00:22:33.519,So wipe that Smirnoff your face and Popov!
00:22:33.686,00:22:36.772,"Oh. Come on, man. You gotta do one cat a solid. Cat to cat."
00:22:36.897,00:22:38.983,"Do a solid here, buddy. Come on."
00:22:41.610,00:22:43.654,This train is for circus animals only.
00:22:50.995,00:22:53.163,Hair too big and glossy!
00:22:59.670,00:23:02.089,This is awkward. We can hear everything they're saying.
00:23:05.968,00:23:07.761,"No, no! No, no, wait! Wait, wait!"
00:23:09.179,00:23:13.225,"Just give us a minute. He's on the phone and, uh, can't get him off."
00:23:18.814,00:23:21.567,We are circus animals. You got to let us in!
00:23:24.069,00:23:25.905,You are really circus?
00:23:28.657,00:23:30.117,-Yes. Full circus! -Absolutely! To the core!
00:23:30.200,00:23:31.702,-My momma was circus… -Totally circus.
00:23:35.581,00:23:36.457,Please.
00:24:15.621,00:24:17.957,You must all be very famous!
00:24:18.791,00:24:20.417,"-Yeah, we, uh-- -Absolutely."
00:24:20.584,00:24:24.296,"-We're, uh, relatively well known-- -But-- But, Alex is really the star."
00:24:24.421,00:24:28.384,"Well, I'm not-- I wouldn't say star. More, more like, more like, well, star."
00:24:28.509,00:24:29.802,"What is your act, Alice?"
00:24:29.927,00:24:38.143,"Well, I, uh, I basically, uh, I jump up on my rock… -Rock? -Yeah. It's a… it's very high-- -A really high rock! -And then?"
00:24:38.227,00:24:45.359,"And then, I, well, I roar like-- Really, like-- like a serious-- -And then? -And then I jump off the rock."
00:24:45.567,00:24:47.945,"-And then? -And then, and then what?"
00:24:48.028,00:24:49.446,-That is all? -Into a pool!
00:24:49.571,00:24:51.448,-Full of water! -Full of cobras!
00:24:51.615,00:24:55.160,"Uh, actually, it appears like I'm jumping in to a pool-- -With cobras. -Aquatic cobras."
00:24:55.327,00:24:57.496,For effect. But I actually pull up at the last second.
00:24:57.746,00:24:58.664,-Pull up? -Yeah.
00:24:58.789,00:25:00.499,-How do you do that? -Wire harness!
00:25:00.582,00:25:01.500,-Balloons! -Jet pack!
00:25:09.258,00:25:11.593,and then toss balloons to the children of the world.
00:25:11.969,00:25:13.762,Kids love it. Kids always love that.
00:25:16.890,00:25:19.059,Yes! Trapeze! Exactly!
00:25:19.184,00:25:21.937,Wow! Trapeze Americano!
00:25:22.187,00:25:31.822,"Hey, I have a great idea! Maybe you come with us to Roma-- Yeah, thanks."
00:25:31.905,00:25:35.075,"Thanks. But, you know, we're gonna get off at the next stop so we can get back to America."
00:25:38.162,00:25:41.665,Because we're going-- Going to-- Let me finish!
00:25:44.710,00:25:45.836,-What? -America?
00:25:45.919,00:25:47.212,-Going to America? -What?
00:25:48.964,00:25:50.966,"After Roma, we go to London."
00:25:53.093,00:25:56.013,…will see us and then send us to New York.
00:25:57.765,00:25:59.767,"Well, only if he likes what he sees."
00:26:01.143,00:26:02.519,That's our home. That's where we live.
00:26:02.603,00:26:04.271,-Isn't that fun? -Could we go with you?
00:26:04.354,00:26:06.648,Sure! You can bunk with Vitaly!
00:26:11.737,00:26:12.696,Nyet!
00:26:15.240,00:26:19.369,I don't think Vitaly likes that idea. What's he gonna do?
00:26:21.080,00:26:23.457,Which one of you is leader?
00:26:27.336,00:26:31.924,"Tell your comrades, there is one rule we do not break!"
00:26:32.925,00:26:35.552,Thou shalt say it and not spray it?
00:26:35.803,00:26:36.678,Nyet!
00:26:37.179,00:26:41.183,Circus owner no allow stowaways.
00:26:46.438,00:26:47.648,"I hear you, Russki."
00:26:47.856,00:26:54.780,"Although, the circus owner may allow stowaways if the stowaways just happen to be the owners."
00:26:56.031,00:26:57.282,Riddle me that.
00:26:58.408,00:27:01.662,"What is sharply dressed, little birdie talking about?"
00:27:02.246,00:27:03.539,"Show 'em, boys."
00:27:14.091,00:27:16.135,"You have a deal, mi amigo."
00:27:18.971,00:27:23.767,I am sure this circus will bring you great success. Shh!
00:27:25.060,00:27:29.148,I guess this is goodbye and good luck!
00:27:37.948,00:27:39.700,What do we know about owning a circus?
00:27:40.033,00:27:42.744,Nothing. But it's our only shot at getting home.
00:27:43.036,00:27:44.496,"Well, you better know what you're doing."
00:27:44.663,00:27:47.082,You're risking Private's community college fund.
00:28:16.570,00:28:18.572,"-Ooh! -Definitely, coach."
00:29:31.144,00:29:32.479,"Hey, gorgeous."
00:29:32.938,00:29:36.191,Has anyone ever told you that you look like a supermodel?
00:29:37.025,00:29:40.529,"Albeit a fat, hairy one who smells."
00:29:40.904,00:29:41.822,Ah!
00:29:50.205,00:29:53.083,Ooh! You have a very hairy back.
00:29:53.625,00:29:54.960,I like that in a woman.
00:30:03.635,00:30:04.803,Don't be a hero!
00:30:12.769,00:30:13.687,Lion.
00:30:15.397,00:30:16.732,Twelve hours old.
00:30:18.025,00:30:19.735,Two hundred and fifty kilograms.
00:30:22.195,00:30:24.698,Glossy mane. Too much conditioner.
00:30:37.961,00:30:39.546,"Hello, kitty!"
00:30:41.631,00:30:44.134,"So, you ran away with the circus."
00:30:44.676,00:30:45.886,What a cliché.
00:31:12.871,00:31:18.668,"If they want to attract a decent sports team, they should bulldoze this rat trap and invest in a new arena."
00:31:25.175,00:31:28.261,"The Colosseum, Marty. The original theatre in the round."
00:31:28.470,00:31:30.347,"You know, my ancestors used to perform here."
00:31:30.514,00:31:33.141,-No kidding! -Yeah. Every show had a captive audience.
00:31:34.684,00:31:35.852,Sounds like a great gig.
00:31:35.936,00:31:38.271,"Trenta minuti, everybody! Trenta minuti!"
00:31:41.942,00:31:43.693,Stay out of the way. Let them do their thing.
00:31:46.363,00:31:50.242,"You gotta go back in your momma's belly, 'cause you're too cute to be out in the real world."
00:31:50.325,00:31:55.831,"-Oi! Naff off, you muppet! -Whoa! What the-- -Marty, they're professionals. Come on. -Whoo! You look gorgeous!"
00:31:56.039,00:32:02.546,"All right, animals! We may be your new owners, but we don't want to reinvent the circus wheel here, so just go out, do what you do."
00:32:02.754,00:32:05.257,Just think of this as a fun warm-up for that promoter in London.
00:32:05.382,00:32:07.551,"Right, Marty? Mart-- Marty?"
00:32:09.678,00:32:12.222,-We could paint you white. -And then paint you pink.
00:32:12.305,00:32:14.558,"-Awesome! -Not laying very low, are we, Marty?"
00:32:14.683,00:32:18.770,Sonya! Where is the bear? Sonya! We're about to start!
00:32:27.654,00:32:28.822,who isn't nice to anybody.
00:32:31.741,00:32:34.411,"-Guys, stop fooling around. -We're just having a little fun."
00:32:46.882,00:32:49.926,-Really? -Sonya! Where is Sonya the bear?
00:33:07.319,00:33:08.236,Aha!
00:33:31.885,00:33:34.888,I want to kiss every inch of your huge head.
00:33:35.514,00:33:37.390,It may take me a number of weeks.
00:33:47.275,00:33:48.318,That was heavy.
00:33:51.696,00:33:53.073,Don't cry. Stop crying.
00:33:53.156,00:33:55.825,"It makes me cry to see you cry, my darling."
00:33:55.951,00:33:57.994,I will get you something even better.
00:34:03.583,00:34:06.294,"Hey, you can buy love. Whoa, not too fast!"
00:34:16.930,00:34:23.353,"presenting Gia, the trapeze-flying jaguar!"
00:34:23.770,00:34:34.614,"And there she go. The triple-flip roll with a double leap, and… -What are you doing? -That's just paper."
00:34:42.497,00:34:45.709,I don't want you to think of me as some sort of authority figure.
00:34:47.836,00:34:49.337,Don't worry. I don't.
00:34:49.629,00:34:51.089,-You don't? Oh! -Not at all.
00:34:51.172,00:34:54.050,"Well, the other circus animals might find me a bit intimidating."
00:34:54.175,00:34:56.428,No. Nobody is intimidated at all by you.
00:34:56.553,00:34:58.722,"Oh, good stuff. Good. Good news."
00:34:58.847,00:35:02.517,"In fact, I do not think they have given you a second thought since you showed up."
00:35:02.601,00:35:03.476,That's good to hear.
00:35:03.852,00:35:06.313,"If anything, they're starting to feel sorry for you."
00:35:06.479,00:35:07.981,"Okay, I get it. Okay?"
00:35:09.065,00:35:10.066,Is there more?
00:35:10.233,00:35:13.737,"Uh, I just wanted to thank you for letting us get on the train back there."
00:35:14.070,00:35:19.951,"I know the big cat with the accent wasn't so excited about us getting on-- Look, lion guy."
00:35:20.493,00:35:22.912,This circus means everything to us.
00:35:23.371,00:35:30.629,"And if you do anything that threatens this circus, you will have to answer to me. Capisce?"
00:35:31.838,00:35:34.424,"I capisce, cool. Trust me, we're cool."
00:35:35.216,00:35:36.885,Ah! Whoa!
00:35:37.677,00:35:38.803,Whoa!
00:35:44.100,00:35:45.644,You call this laying low?
00:36:05.455,00:36:08.667,"Where there is circus, there is lion."
00:36:12.837,00:36:14.214,Vive la France!
00:36:24.974,00:36:28.978,"Come on, my hairy queen. We'll do doughnuts in the Pantheon."
00:36:41.950,00:36:53.128,"Now you're really, really in big tro-- -Okay! Strike up the band! -You have a band?"
00:36:55.964,00:36:58.258,Prepare to be blown away!
00:37:04.389,00:37:05.849,Look at this. Whoa! Hey!
00:37:09.144,00:37:10.478,-Yay! -Whoo!
00:37:19.487,00:37:20.864,Get on with it!
00:37:25.660,00:37:26.536,Uh-oh!
00:37:29.205,00:37:30.415,-Boo! -Boo!
00:37:42.427,00:37:44.596,"Well, that was worth the price of admission."
00:37:55.190,00:37:57.525,"Stefano, you know, blown away means good, right?"
00:37:57.734,00:38:01.654,Don't worry. The big finale is coming up. Give me a downbeat.
00:38:04.824,00:38:07.368,"Oh, no. No, this is not happening."
00:38:08.453,00:38:10.455,"You have a deal, mi amigo."
00:38:12.582,00:38:15.043,"Yes, go out and get food and come back."
00:38:23.176,00:38:25.220,Deep breaths. You're in a happy place. All good.
00:38:25.386,00:38:28.681,"There's an angry mob outside, and they're demanding their money back!"
00:38:29.140,00:38:31.643,"I think we all know, the right thing to do."
00:38:50.036,00:38:51.204,-Mamma mia! -They're gaining on you.
00:38:58.837,00:39:00.380,Just throw us the money!
00:39:12.308,00:39:14.435,Captain Chantel DuBois. Get up.
00:39:14.602,00:39:18.648,I'm going to have to send you back to Monaco under maximum security.
00:39:25.738,00:39:27.031,It's just a pillow!
00:39:27.156,00:39:29.742,"Hey, that's the oldest trick in the book, Comandante."
00:39:29.951,00:39:32.495,Every bambino in Italy knows that one.
00:39:32.662,00:39:39.002,"Maybe, uh, but do they know about the old escape hole behind the innocent-looking poster?"
00:39:42.505,00:39:45.925,"Or the really old, I'm gonna hide up on the ceiling trick!"
00:39:53.099,00:39:56.102,Of course. The secret tunnel under the bed!
00:40:24.088,00:40:25.006,Voilà!
00:40:44.233,00:40:46.319,and we're not any closer to New York.
00:40:46.444,00:40:48.029,"If anything, we're further away."
00:40:48.154,00:40:51.324,We could have at least bought a circus that knew how to circ!
00:40:51.783,00:40:54.702,"I don't even know, why we bought a circus in the first place."
00:40:54.911,00:40:56.663,We had enough dough for a plane!
00:40:57.121,00:40:59.582,-Are you kidding me? -You must have some money left over.
00:40:59.749,00:41:02.669,I used it to buy teeth and then have them capped in gold.
00:41:03.252,00:41:04.504,Now I can eat apples.
00:41:05.672,00:41:09.008,"Sadly, I discovered, I… I don't like apples."
00:41:16.557,00:41:17.767,-…was so happy to sell. -Shh!
00:41:25.858,00:41:27.527,-Where did Alex go? -I don't know.
00:41:37.245,00:41:39.414,Come on! This way!
00:41:40.123,00:41:41.874,"No, no, no. You come this way!"
00:41:42.000,00:41:44.502,"Hey, Alice, watch your head!"
00:41:55.138,00:41:56.055,Huh?
00:41:57.849,00:41:58.808,Alice!
00:42:13.948,00:42:16.701,Was that Trapeze Americano?
00:42:16.826,00:42:19.245,"-Uh, yeah. Sort of. -Incredible!"
00:42:19.412,00:42:21.998,"-I hope this is important. -Come this way, Alice!"
00:42:24.000,00:42:27.295,"By the way, it's icks not iss. Alex. Like New York Knicks."
00:42:27.503,00:42:31.340,I know. New York Kniss. It's not hard.
00:42:31.924,00:42:32.842,Whoa.
00:42:43.311,00:42:44.520,What is this place?
00:42:44.896,00:42:50.651,"I know, you think we are a stinky, poopy circus, but there is something you must know."
00:42:51.694,00:42:56.657,"There was a time when Circus Zaragoza, we were a great circus!"
00:42:56.991,00:42:59.327,Numero uno in all the Europe!
00:42:59.827,00:43:03.831,"And Vitaly, he was the biggest star of us all."
00:43:04.582,00:43:08.419,He was fearless. Taking risks. Always new.
00:43:08.586,00:43:11.089,"He jump through the hoop, like he could fly!"
00:43:21.224,00:43:23.893,Vitaly! Vitaly!
00:43:25.019,00:43:28.022,Stefano! Make the hoop smaller.
00:43:28.439,00:43:30.650,-Like this? -Smaller.
00:43:30.983,00:43:32.652,-Like this? -Good!
00:43:53.297,00:43:56.300,"And the people, they loved it!"
00:43:57.802,00:43:58.761,Smaller!
00:44:13.192,00:44:18.614,Like the ring on a finger of the tiniest lady with the slimmest of fingers.
00:44:26.247,00:44:30.751,And one fateful day… he push too far!
00:44:31.252,00:44:33.921,Light the hoop on fire!
00:44:59.530,00:45:04.160,Literally. The extra virgin olive oil is extra flammable.
00:45:04.744,00:45:06.287,And he lost everything.
00:45:06.787,00:45:09.624,"His wife, she run off with a musician."
00:45:10.124,00:45:16.589,"He lost his dignity, his fame, his passion, and his fur."
00:45:17.465,00:45:22.386,"And when it grow back, it is less soft. More like a prickly beard."
00:45:22.970,00:45:24.263,"Scusi, Vitaly!"
00:45:29.560,00:45:30.770,…is the borscht.
00:45:33.439,00:45:36.484,-Whoa. -He was our inspiration.
00:45:36.984,00:45:42.156,"So when he lost his passion, well, as Vitaly goes, so goes the circus."
00:45:42.740,00:45:45.493,-This is why we need your help. -What sort of help?
00:45:45.701,00:45:49.622,You can teach us to do new circus. Americano style!
00:45:49.830,00:45:51.123,We find a new passion.
00:45:51.332,00:45:56.212,"Make a new show. And we go all the way to U, S and A!"
00:46:00.841,00:46:01.801,A!
00:46:04.428,00:46:07.431,I know. It is stupido idea.
00:46:07.974,00:46:09.433,We are a lost cause.
00:46:13.646,00:46:14.522,This could work!
00:46:16.232,00:46:17.733,-What? -What you just said.
00:46:20.945,00:46:23.030,-What? -Your stupido idea!
00:46:23.239,00:46:25.741,"-It could? -Stefano, you're a genius."
00:46:26.450,00:46:29.370,"No, no, no, no. I am only average intelligence."
00:46:29.829,00:46:32.581,"Some say, I'm even slightly below."
00:46:33.332,00:46:36.669,We are gonna rethink everything anybody's ever known about circus.
00:46:36.877,00:46:49.015,"I call it Phase 4-7B, wherein, in order to get home, we will come up with something fresh, something amazing, something brand new! Fresh, never before seen. Off the chain!"
00:46:49.265,00:46:51.976,Something that'll blow that circus promoter away!
00:46:54.729,00:46:55.688,Who do you think you are?
00:46:55.813,00:46:57.356,-Are you kidding? -I'm gonna chew his leg off!
00:46:58.107,00:47:00.234,Circus has been same for generations!
00:47:00.359,00:47:02.695,"We make good, classic family entertainment."
00:47:02.820,00:47:08.159,"Aha! But last few generations, families not so entertained."
00:47:11.871,00:47:16.667,That's right. Families not so entertained because you're just going through the motions out there.
00:47:16.917,00:47:18.252,It's missing passion.
00:47:18.461,00:47:21.797,How one to have passion for stool poked in face?
00:47:22.089,00:47:25.926,"Exactly! And by stool, you mean chair, right?"
00:47:27.428,00:47:29.263,"The fact is, you guys, you got stuck in a rut."
00:47:29.597,00:47:31.849,"You stopped pushing, you stopped taking risks."
00:47:32.350,00:47:34.060,But those days are over.
00:47:34.268,00:47:37.480,"Because now, we're going to completely change the show."
00:47:37.646,00:47:39.523,"Then it wouldn't be a circus, would it?"
00:47:40.232,00:47:42.985,Circus is not about the acts you do.
00:47:43.402,00:47:45.863,Circus is in here.
00:47:48.783,00:47:52.870,"Circus is about following your passions, wherever they take you!"
00:47:57.666,00:48:07.551,"That's what everybody thought, Vitaly, until those French Canadians came along, drunk off their maple syrup and cheap pharmaceuticals, and completely flipped the paradigm."
00:48:07.718,00:48:12.681,Now they play Vegas. Fifty shows a day in 52 separate venues.
00:48:12.807,00:48:14.934,And one of them completely in the nude.
00:48:15.059,00:48:16.811,"Yeah, that's right. And you know how they did it?"
00:48:17.144,00:48:18.521,Take off their clothes?
00:48:27.363,00:48:28.572,"Well, you know what I say to that?"
00:48:28.656,00:48:36.789,"I say, they can take the animals out of the circus, but, they cannot take the animals out of the circus!"
00:48:41.710,00:48:43.546,I think you understand what I'm saying!
00:48:45.548,00:48:46.549,"Uh, no!"
00:48:46.715,00:48:50.010,"We don't need humans, because we've got passion."
00:48:50.136,00:48:51.846,"What does a human say, when he's passionate?"
00:48:51.929,00:48:54.348,"He says, I'm an animal! Well, we are animals!"
00:48:57.184,00:48:59.478,We'll make an all-animal circus.
00:48:59.728,00:49:02.815,"Because if we follow our passion, we can go anywhere."
00:49:02.940,00:49:05.151,-Anywhere! -We can do anything!
00:49:05.276,00:49:08.028,-Anything! -If we do it together!
00:49:08.154,00:49:11.657,-All of us! -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!
00:49:14.910,00:49:18.122,"-We're in! We'll have some of that! -Can I hear you say, fur power?"
00:49:18.205,00:49:19.081,Fur power!
00:49:19.165,00:49:21.542,"Take our circus back, and we'll do it together!"
00:49:21.625,00:49:22.543,Fur power! Fur power!
00:49:22.626,00:49:26.046,"-You and me, baby! What? An act together! -I love it!"
00:49:26.213,00:49:28.382,We can do that funk and groove dance thing.
00:49:28.549,00:49:30.426,"-Uh, dance? -This thing right here. Look."
00:49:32.052,00:49:36.182,-Me and you! We got this! -But I-- I-- I-- I can't dance.
00:49:36.265,00:49:37.391,-Fur power! -Fur power!
00:49:37.475,00:49:40.519,-Chanting is fun! Chanting is fun! -Fur power! Fur power!
00:49:45.107,00:49:51.947,"Vitaly, I may not trust him, either, but I am tired of sitting and standing, and rolling over."
00:49:52.114,00:49:55.868,"It is great tradition of sitting, standing, rolling over."
00:49:55.993,00:49:58.412,You know our circus is in trouble.
00:49:58.787,00:50:03.417,This could be our last chance. But we will not do this without you.
00:50:04.251,00:50:06.295,Circus always stay together.
00:50:21.560,00:50:22.436,Oh!
00:50:39.662,00:50:44.083,Attention! I have found our lion! He is hiding with the circus.
00:51:19.326,00:51:20.202,Hmm?
00:52:09.877,00:52:12.755,Are you really gonna shoot yourself out of that thing?
00:52:13.213,00:52:20.137,"I've always dreamed of doing this, from the time I was a little pup, to be a human cannonball!"
00:52:23.932,00:52:25.142,Is it dangerous?
00:52:25.351,00:52:29.146,"Is it dangerous? Yes, of course it is dangerous!"
00:52:29.480,00:52:31.774,"-Now, are you sure about this? -I'm sure."
00:52:31.899,00:52:34.693,"'Cause if blowing up is your thing, then you in the right place."
00:52:34.902,00:52:36.737,Sì. That's means yes!
00:52:37.029,00:52:39.990,-Ready for launch? -Ready for launch!
00:52:59.134,00:53:02.262,Mamma mia! Help me!
00:53:02.513,00:53:03.389,Help me!
00:53:03.555,00:53:06.100,Rico! Get the cannon ready. Same charge!
00:53:16.193,00:53:17.111,Whoa!
00:53:24.743,00:53:25.828,All right!
00:53:32.543,00:53:34.837,Woo-hoo!
00:53:36.130,00:53:37.047,Oh!
00:53:37.798,00:53:38.757,Whoo!
00:53:39.633,00:53:40.551,Yeah!
00:53:41.260,00:53:44.847,Whoo!
00:53:45.931,00:53:48.600,Marty! I'm so glad you're here.
00:53:48.851,00:53:52.521,Whoo! I was flying! I was effin-L-Y-in!
00:53:54.857,00:53:57.484,…I don't think I can hold on much longer!
00:53:57.609,00:54:00.320,"Oh, oh, oh, yeah, right. Sorry about my enthusiasm."
00:54:01.488,00:54:02.906,"Here, wrap this around you."
00:54:20.090,00:54:23.469,Forget about being part of the herd. I'm gonna be part of the flock.
00:54:23.677,00:54:27.890,"-I'm going to fly, baby! -Oh, yes! What a triumph!"
00:54:28.265,00:54:31.018,"-Oi, what’s he doing? -Hand over that circus, Freddie!"
00:54:32.978,00:54:34.354,"-Oh, get off! -Come on, guys, chill out."
00:54:34.480,00:54:36.190,Cute and cuddly's obviously not your thing.
00:54:37.858,00:54:39.568,"I got a better idea. Show 'em, Rico."
00:54:43.989,00:54:45.783,"Oh, that was great!"
00:54:53.248,00:54:55.209,Whoo! Hey. Hi.
00:54:55.334,00:54:57.586,I admire how you have inspired these animals.
00:54:57.711,00:54:58.587,"Oh, thanks."
00:54:58.670,00:55:02.132,"And what you said about passion, it was like poetry."
00:55:02.216,00:55:04.218,"I love passion and poetry. They go together, really."
00:55:04.384,00:55:07.012,"-I mean, I know, they don't rhyme. -Trapeze is my passion."
00:55:07.095,00:55:08.806,Terrific. I look forward to seeing you up there.
00:55:08.889,00:55:10.140,You can teach me.
00:55:11.809,00:55:13.644,"Oh, well, you know, I've always been kind of a solo act."
00:55:13.769,00:55:18.357,"-So, that kind of rules that out. -I wonder if you actually do trapeze."
00:55:18.649,00:55:21.401,"-Oh, I actually do do trapeze. -Show me!"
00:55:24.029,00:55:25.697,"I am five, yes."
00:55:28.283,00:55:32.329,Dancing. All you're doing is moving and not getting anywhere.
00:55:32.538,00:55:35.249,"I mean, the-- the music totally throws off my timing."
00:55:35.415,00:55:39.211,"You want-- You want excitement? Ha-ha! Check it out. Who's on a tightrope, huh?"
00:55:39.336,00:55:46.969,"Huh? Who's on a-- Melman! Oh, my gosh!"
00:55:47.386,00:55:49.054,"-Help me! -Baby, hold on. Hold on."
00:55:59.481,00:56:00.440,"Calm down, Melman."
00:56:07.948,00:56:09.449,-Come to me. -I-- I can't.
00:56:09.616,00:56:14.121,"It's just like dancing, Melman. Two steps forward, one step back."
00:56:14.204,00:56:17.374,"I can't dance, okay? Okay? There, I said it."
00:56:17.499,00:56:20.627,"-Maybe because you've never tried. -No, I have tried."
00:56:21.086,00:56:24.673,"I, uh, I practiced in private, because you dance so well."
00:56:25.007,00:56:27.426,You practiced? For me?
00:56:27.509,00:56:31.138,"Yes, but it's no use. I never know what to do with my arms."
00:56:33.181,00:56:34.266,Hold it. Okay.
00:56:34.391,00:56:36.935,"That part is so easy, Melman. Okay?"
00:56:37.185,00:56:39.855,'Cause all you have to do is put them around your partner.
00:56:43.775,00:56:45.068,-One step back. -Whoo!
00:56:45.611,00:56:49.948,-I'm dancing. I'm dancing! -Two steps forward -One step back. -We're dancing on a tightrope!
00:56:50.073,00:56:52.576,-You're great. -Woo-hoo! I'm dancing!
00:56:59.166,00:57:00.083,All right.
00:57:00.208,00:57:03.170,"So, when do we get the jet packs and aquatic cobras?"
00:57:03.295,00:57:06.298,"Uh, well, this is a beginners' class, and that's a pretty advanced maneuver."
00:57:06.423,00:57:07.716,"Okay, how do we begin?"
00:57:07.799,00:57:13.764,"Well, it's a bit complicated unless you understand the whole pitch and yaw, arc and gravity."
00:57:13.889,00:57:17.225,"All that stuff, which I won't bore you with. Okay."
00:57:20.604,00:57:22.105,Just-- Just watch and learn!
00:57:22.522,00:57:24.650,Whoa! Whoa!
00:57:32.574,00:57:49.466,"-Like that? -That's one way of doing it, sure-- Yes. Trapeze Americano. We use the net."
00:57:54.054,00:57:56.223,Trapeze Americano!
00:58:06.900,00:58:07.859,Whoo!
00:58:38.056,00:58:40.267,Bravo! Bravissima!
00:58:40.600,00:58:43.687,"Hey, Vitaly, maybe you even do two hoops, no?"
00:59:02.039,00:59:03.999,Don't make it any easier on the psycho.
00:59:04.207,00:59:06.752,"-What are we gonna do? -We'd better vamoose, pronto."
00:59:06.835,00:59:09.046,But we're not ready. We're in the middle of rehearsals.
00:59:09.171,00:59:13.258,"So, then why don't you lilt over, grab your peduncle, and kiss New York goodbye?"
00:59:14.551,00:59:16.094,Are you sure we are ready?
00:59:16.219,00:59:18.972,"Of course, we're ready! Born ready. Ready steady. Come on, let's go!"
00:59:19.097,00:59:20.474,"Let's go, go, go, go, go!"
00:59:24.519,00:59:28.231,Grab your luggage and drain your bladders. It's going to be a long ride.
00:59:36.782,00:59:38.450,let's blow that promoter away!
01:00:02.933,01:00:07.104,-Vitaly! Vitaly! Vitaly! -Vitaly! Vitaly! Vitaly!
01:00:44.391,01:00:47.853,We need to get this show on the road. Private! Tell them the eagle has landed.
01:00:48.019,01:00:49.146,The eagle has landed.
01:00:49.271,01:00:51.731,"Roger that. Oh, and keep an eye out for DuBois."
01:00:52.065,01:00:52.941,"Aye, aye, guvnor."
01:00:53.066,01:00:56.069,-The promoter is in the house! -New York is closer than ever!
01:00:56.153,01:00:58.947,"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, we got a circus to do."
01:00:59.030,01:00:59.990,"-Got it -We're on, folks!"
01:01:00.073,01:01:02.325,-Do we go on before or after the dogs? -Yes.
01:01:02.534,01:01:04.244,"-What? -Overlap, your acts overlap."
01:01:04.327,01:01:05.620,-We go in between? -Where's Vitaly? He opens.
01:01:07.330,01:01:10.417,"Stefano! Hey, Stefano! Have you seen Vitaly?"
01:01:14.421,01:01:16.423,"Stefano, why the sad little face?"
01:01:16.798,01:01:20.093,"-Vitaly, he will not go on! -What?"
01:01:27.434,01:01:29.728,Where is he? I'm sure I can reason with him.
01:01:33.565,01:01:35.901,"-Vitaly, what are you doing? -You missed."
01:01:36.234,01:01:39.279,You're leaving? You're just gonna walk out on everybody?
01:01:39.654,01:01:41.198,They have good show without me.
01:01:41.281,01:01:44.534,"Look, I got a good left foot, but without my right foot, I can't walk."
01:01:44.618,01:01:46.328,"You get fake foot, then you walk."
01:01:49.289,01:01:52.667,What happened to circus stick together? Huh? The show must go on.
01:01:52.834,01:01:54.002,Clichés.
01:01:54.294,01:01:57.505,"Come on, man. Stop being this guy! Be the other guy!"
01:01:57.589,01:01:58.715,What other guy?
01:01:58.840,01:02:02.052,"The guy, who was all circus! The guy, who jumped through hoops!"
01:02:08.183,01:02:10.352,Come on. Where's that Vitaly?
01:02:11.937,01:02:14.606,That Vitaly is no more.
01:02:16.066,01:02:21.029,"Listen, man. You may have given up on yourself… but your friends haven't given up on you."
01:02:22.906,01:02:26.743,"Are you just gonna turn your back on them, and sit and eat borscht the rest of your life?"
01:02:27.577,01:02:31.456,Or are you gonna get out there and jump through that tiny little hoop?
01:02:37.671,01:02:41.591,"It was always impossible, Vitaly. That's why the people loved it."
01:02:47.347,01:02:48.890,That is why I loved it.
01:02:50.058,01:02:53.520,Because I did the impossible!
01:02:54.729,01:02:57.190,I was once a brave tiger.
01:02:58.525,01:03:07.242,"And if I go down in flames… You know, I think, I might have an idea for you."
01:03:19.296,01:03:22.007,Light the hoop on fire!
01:03:44.195,01:03:46.281,"Mamma mia, Santa Maria, Santa Maria."
01:03:49.242,01:03:52.120,Mamma Maria. Nia Santa. Santa Mia Farrow.
01:03:53.705,01:03:54.706,"Come on, you got it."
01:04:14.476,01:04:15.643,"All right, what are you waiting for?"
01:04:15.727,01:04:16.936,-We got a show to put on. -Whoo!
01:06:31.029,01:06:33.615,"Now, that's what I call crack-a-lackin' to the mack-a-lackin'!"
01:06:35.533,01:06:37.785,"Maybe, I am average intelligence, after all."
01:06:37.869,01:06:39.829,"Perhaps, even slightly above."
01:06:41.247,01:06:42.332,"No, I don't think so."
01:06:42.707,01:06:46.336,"Ha! Hair conditioner. Great idea, my friend."
01:06:56.804,01:07:00.016,"Gia and Alex, the trapezing cats!"
01:07:00.141,01:07:02.727,"-We did pretty good. -You will flip, and I will catch."
01:07:02.894,01:07:05.271,"And sometimes I will flip, and you will catch."
01:07:20.245,01:07:23.456,…I… I may not always be around.
01:07:23.581,01:07:24.791,Where are you going?
01:07:29.629,01:07:30.880,"Bravo, bravo!"
01:07:31.923,01:07:35.343,"What a heartwarming performance, Monsieur Circus Master."
01:07:35.635,01:07:37.262,It brought tears to my eyes.
01:07:46.354,01:07:48.314,He is a fugitive from justice.
01:07:48.731,01:07:53.069,"You will turn the lion over to me, so that I may put him where he belongs."
01:07:56.573,01:07:57.782,On my wall.
01:08:18.469,01:08:21.264,"Up high! Ooh, ha! Down low. Too slow."
01:08:21.556,01:08:23.349,"-Well done, Private. -Did I do good?"
01:08:25.685,01:08:27.186,"Man, that was close."
01:08:29.606,01:08:31.190,You are from a zoo?
01:08:36.321,01:08:37.196,Yes.
01:08:37.864,01:08:39.616,"Yes. But wait, there's more."
01:08:39.699,01:08:41.451,-More? -Or less. There's less.
01:08:41.534,01:08:43.286,You were never circus?
01:08:43.911,01:08:47.415,"-Well, we-- we had to say, we were circus. -Or you'd never have let us on the train."
01:08:47.832,01:08:53.755,After all we have been through together… you want to go live in a zoo?
01:08:54.213,01:08:55.590,"-Gia, I-- -You used us."
01:08:55.715,01:08:59.886,"No, no, no. I mean-- I mean, yes, but-- And Trapeze Americano, you make that up, too?"
01:09:00.261,01:09:02.347,It didn't exactly exist when I taught it to you.
01:09:07.018,01:09:11.230,"Balloons to the children of the world was not real, either?"
01:09:11.356,01:09:13.816,"Well, yeah, that's not real. But look at what we did."
01:09:13.900,01:09:17.945,I was shot out of a cannon! I could have died!
01:09:18.196,01:09:20.406,But I thought it was your lifelong dream.
01:09:20.907,01:09:24.994,"For all I know, your name is not even Alice."
01:09:26.454,01:09:28.706,"No, Stefano, but it never really was."
01:09:34.337,01:09:38.299,"Gia, I… We trusted you."
01:09:41.177,01:09:42.845,My tears are real!
01:09:43.680,01:09:44.597,You are not!
01:10:05.952,01:10:24.929,"Stop it! No means no! Or in your language… Now, I'm getting the silent treatment, am I?"
01:10:25.221,01:10:26.514,"Come over here, right now!"
01:10:29.600,01:10:33.271,"Don't shut me out, baby! What is wrong with you? Speak!"
01:10:37.275,01:10:40.653,"Okay. If these are your feelings, I understand now."
01:10:43.156,01:10:47.243,"It's obvious, I'm just an emotional whoopee cushion for you to sit on."
01:10:48.828,01:10:52.248,When you look for where I am… I won't be there!
01:11:18.441,01:11:20.693,"Come, everybody. We have a show to do."
01:11:24.614,01:11:26.324,-Stefano. -I don't know what to do.
01:11:35.875,01:11:39.128,"Go back to sitting and standing, and rolling over?"
01:11:42.173,01:11:44.884,We can do impossible.
01:11:45.843,01:11:48.638,And we never go back to way we used to be.
01:11:49.138,01:11:52.266,"The way it used to be, isn't the way it was."
01:11:52.475,01:11:57.188,"And it won't be the same without them, whatever way it is."
01:12:17.124,01:12:19.919,Well… we're here.
01:12:22.797,01:12:23.714,Home.
01:12:24.549,01:12:25.424,Huh?
01:12:26.300,01:12:28.427,My rock looks smaller than I remember it.
01:12:32.473,01:12:35.017,"Doesn't actually capture the real thing, does it?"
01:12:36.769,01:12:37.728,Wow.
01:12:39.730,01:12:42.441,"I forgot about that wall in between us, Melman."
01:12:42.817,01:12:45.111,-Mm-hmm -Was that always there?
01:12:51.033,01:12:54.662,"Guys, I'm sorry I ever left the zoo in the first place."
01:12:55.834,01:12:56.789,What do you mean?
01:12:57.582,01:13:02.753,"I mean, if I had just stayed put, we wouldn't have anything to be sad about right now."
01:13:05.840,01:13:09.719,Leaving the zoo was the best thing that ever happened to us.
01:13:11.512,01:13:12.388,Really?
01:13:13.222,01:13:17.101,"Yeah. Out there, in the world, we were really living."
01:13:18.728,01:13:20.813,-It was romantic. -It was dangerous.
01:13:20.980,01:13:22.523,I never felt so alive!
01:13:22.773,01:13:25.610,"When we were with the circus, we were already home."
01:13:27.320,01:13:29.280,I only wish we'd realized that sooner.
01:13:30.698,01:13:32.575,I'm really going to miss those guys.
01:13:34.243,01:13:37.788,"-What do you say, we go back? -Really?"
01:13:37.955,01:13:38.956,-I'm with you! -I'm in!
01:13:39.040,01:13:40.625,Yeah. But what do we tell them?
01:13:40.833,01:13:44.128,"Well, we-- we make it right by telling them how wrong we were."
01:13:44.211,01:13:45.171,It's worth a shot.
01:13:51.093,01:13:53.888,"Hey, is my neck getting longer?"
01:13:54.096,01:13:56.265,Feel my fur. It's so soft.
01:13:56.390,01:13:57.642,It is soft.
01:13:57.808,01:14:02.313,I'm like a candy cane in a black and white movie.
01:14:05.650,01:14:06.692,DuBois.
01:14:07.360,01:14:11.238,"Sonya, I miss you, baby! I miss my stinky bear!"
01:14:16.494,01:14:17.578,Surprise!
01:14:19.997,01:14:21.999,He will never fit in the carry-on.
01:14:28.214,01:14:30.007,Look! Look what she's done!
01:14:30.383,01:14:32.343,You brought back Alex the lion!
01:14:32.426,01:14:35.054,-It's a miracle! -Thank you! Thank you!
01:14:37.181,01:14:38.474,Sonya!
01:14:42.561,01:14:43.896,"Sonya, baby!"
01:14:44.105,01:14:46.273,I don't want to be king anymore!
01:14:46.399,01:14:56.033,"I was so hung up on who I was, who you was, what you smelled like, when all that really matters, is what we smell like together."
01:15:03.582,01:15:05.835,-Gasp! It's DuBois! -Baba booey!
01:15:07.378,01:15:09.630,-Where did you get this? -I got it from the zoo.
01:15:09.714,01:15:11.257,The hippies got ambushed!
01:15:11.340,01:15:13.342,What? We have to help them!
01:15:13.467,01:15:14.635,But they lied to us!
01:15:14.719,01:15:18.014,-Yeah. Why should we lift a paw? -They are our friends!
01:15:18.139,01:15:19.598,They're not even circus.
01:15:21.058,01:15:22.351,That's Bolshevik!
01:15:23.978,01:15:28.065,"I never thought, I'd say this on American soil, but the Russki's right."
01:15:38.617,01:15:41.620,"-Oh, no. -Alex? Where-- Where are you?"
01:15:43.873,01:15:47.501,-Are you okay? -…the king… -What is happening? -…of New York City… Alex!
01:15:47.626,01:15:49.378,"-No, no! No, no! No, no! -…Alex the lion!"
01:16:01.015,01:16:02.516,to this special celebration.
01:16:02.767,01:16:09.482,"And now, the woman who made this all possible, who brought Alex the lion and a couple of… Three?"
01:16:09.565,01:16:11.901,Three other animals back to New York.
01:16:12.026,01:16:13.444,And she's French.
01:16:13.778,01:16:16.655,"Ooh, la la! Please welcome, Chantel DuBois!"
01:16:47.895,01:16:48.896,Alex?
01:16:59.532,01:17:01.492,It was never about the money.
01:17:03.577,01:17:07.748,It was about… the lion.
01:17:18.384,01:17:20.803,-Gia? -Circus stick together.
01:17:32.314,01:17:33.274,No!
01:17:37.945,01:17:41.782,"Operation Afro-Circus Rescue, engage!"
01:17:44.160,01:17:45.744,Unleash the seal.
01:17:46.495,01:17:48.455,-I am a sea lion. -Whatever.
01:17:52.751,01:17:55.546,"Two tons of fun. Dive, dive, dive!"
01:18:02.178,01:18:04.346,"-Let's rock. -You and me, baby!"
01:18:45.387,01:18:47.640,-Whoo! -Yeah! Whoo!
01:18:56.690,01:18:58.317,Don't leave without me!
01:19:04.365,01:19:05.366,"Oh, no!"
01:19:11.622,01:19:13.916,"Go, Stefano! Climb!"
01:19:29.056,01:19:32.017,"-I will have your head! -Oh, no! Help me!"
01:19:32.101,01:19:33.018,Alex!
01:19:39.858,01:19:41.402,Marty! Shoot me a line.
01:19:41.694,01:19:44.697,"You got it. Afro, don't fail me now!"
01:19:48.784,01:19:52.705,-What are you doing? -We are doing Trapeze Americano.
01:19:53.080,01:19:54.123,Let's do it!
01:19:55.499,01:19:57.459,"-Frankie, Jonesy, be ready! -You got it, boss!"
01:19:57.584,01:19:58.544,"Go, go, go!"
01:20:10.055,01:20:12.850,-Gia! Take Stefano! -Alex!
01:20:27.531,01:20:30.826,"If I am going down, your head is coming with me!"
01:20:32.953,01:20:33.954,"Oi, let's go!"
01:20:35.831,01:20:38.125,"You're going down, but not with my head."
01:20:41.545,01:20:43.380,Jet pack! He pull up!
01:20:45.132,01:20:46.342,"…are over, DuBois!"
01:20:57.269,01:21:00.147,This is where animals like you belong. Now sit.
01:21:02.149,01:21:03.108,Lie down.
01:21:29.009,01:21:30.719,Trapeze Americano!
01:21:30.844,01:21:32.888,-It is real. -It's real!
01:21:45.359,01:21:48.445,"So, you, uh, want to run away with the circus?"
01:21:49.238,01:21:51.407,-Live a life of adventure? -Full of romance?
01:21:51.532,01:21:53.409,-And danger. -Really living!
01:21:53.826,01:21:55.077,What do you say?
01:22:13.846,01:22:14.763,Move it!
01:22:19.059,01:22:21.395,"what did you end up doing with the crazy lady, anyway?"
