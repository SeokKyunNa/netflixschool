00:05:39.547,00:05:42.508,K: I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty.
00:05:45.344,00:05:49.849,I was careful not to drag in any dirt.
00:05:50.808,00:05:52.727,SAPPER: I don't mind the dirt.
00:05:54.437,00:05:56.397,I do mind...
00:05:57.190,00:05:59.317,...unannounced visits.
00:06:02.361,00:06:03.404,You police?
00:06:05.531,00:06:10.119,Are you Sapper Morton? Civic number NK68514?
00:06:10.286,00:06:13.414,-I'm a farmer. -I saw that.
00:06:14.582,00:06:16.417,What do you farm?
00:06:23.633,00:06:25.551,It's a protein farm.
00:06:26.010,00:06:27.929,Wallace design.
00:06:29.639,00:06:30.890,Is that what I smell?
00:06:32.100,00:06:34.185,Grow that just for me.
00:06:34.685,00:06:35.853,Garlic.
00:06:36.020,00:06:37.355,Garlic.
00:06:38.022,00:06:39.941,"Go on, try some."
00:06:40.733,00:06:42.485,"No, thank you."
00:06:44.195,00:06:48.282,I prefer to keep an empty stomach until the hard part of the day is done.
00:06:51.077,00:06:52.745,How long you been here?
00:06:52.912,00:06:55.039,SAPPER: Since 2020.
00:06:55.665,00:06:58.543,"K: But you haven't always been a farmer, have you?"
00:07:00.211,00:07:01.546,Your bag.
00:07:02.046,00:07:03.840,It's colonial medical use.

00:07:15.601,00:07:17.645,Must have been brutal.
00:07:17.812,00:07:20.106,Plan on taking me in?
00:07:21.190,00:07:24.235,Let them take a look inside?
00:07:24.902,00:07:26.696,Mr. Morton...
00:07:27.363,00:07:30.032,...if taking you in is an option...
00:07:34.078,00:07:37.206,...I would much prefer that to the alternative.
00:07:38.166,00:07:40.668,I'm sure you knew it would be someone in time.
00:07:43.129,00:07:45.631,I'm sorry it had to be me.
00:07:48.885,00:07:50.761,SAPPER: Good as any.
00:07:53.681,00:07:56.517,"Now, if you don't mind..."
00:07:58.102,00:08:01.147,"...if you could just look up and to the left, please."
00:08:57.662,00:08:58.788,Please don't get up.
00:09:10.758,00:09:14.220,SAPPER: How's it feel killing your own kind?
00:09:17.807,00:09:21.477,I don't retire my own kind because we don't run.
00:09:23.062,00:09:24.522,Only older models do.
00:09:24.689,00:09:29.485,And you new models are happy scraping the shit...
00:09:34.115,00:09:37.159,...because you've never seen a miracle.
00:10:18.034,00:10:20.494,K: Just photograph everything.
00:10:31.714,00:10:33.633,"Madam, please."
00:10:39.639,00:10:41.766,You're hurt. I'm not paying for that.
00:10:43.267,00:10:44.769,-I'll glue it. -And?
00:10:51.651,00:10:53.486,One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.
00:10:53.653,00:10:56.280,He looks like he could take your head off.
00:10:56.447,00:10:57.657,He tried.
00:10:57.823,00:10:59.575,He went AWOL after Calantha...
00:10:59.742,00:11:03.037,...with a few more in his outfit I wouldn't mind closing out.
00:11:03.204,00:11:05.081,-Just him? -Just him.
00:11:06.165,00:11:08.417,Come on home for your baseline.

00:12:19.447,00:12:20.489,JOSHI: What is that?
00:12:26.620,00:12:27.788,I'll send a dig team.

00:16:39.957,00:16:41.792,How was your day?
00:16:43.002,00:16:45.295,I'm getting cabin fever.

00:16:52.720,00:16:57.641,I had an accident at work. I think I ruined my shirt.

00:17:07.860,00:17:09.862,I need a drink.
00:17:10.446,00:17:13.907,"-Do you want a drink first? -Mm-hm. Pour me one, will you?"
00:17:15.743,00:17:19.246,I'm trying a new recipe. I just need a bit more practice.
00:17:19.413,00:17:20.456,K: Don't fuss.
00:17:23.584,00:17:28.213,I should have marinated it longer. I hope it isn't dry.
00:17:30.132,00:17:35.220,Did you know this song was released in 1966 on Reprise Records?
00:17:35.387,00:17:37.931,It was number one on the charts.
00:17:42.728,00:17:46.940,It won't be much longer. Just putting on the finishing touches.

00:25:31.363,00:25:32.864,A sentimental skin-job.
00:25:35.492,00:25:36.993,Sorry.
00:25:37.369,00:25:39.621,So where's the kid?

00:26:40.140,00:26:42.392,She was a Replicant.

00:27:05.623,00:27:07.500,Or a slaughter.

00:27:23.224,00:27:26.353,That's what we do here. We keep order.
00:27:27.896,00:27:29.022,You want it gone?

00:27:39.866,00:27:42.285,You have anything more to say?
00:27:43.703,00:27:46.956,I've never retired something that was born before.
00:27:47.707,00:27:49.709,What's the difference?

00:30:59.148,00:31:02.485,FILE CLERK: Everyone remembers where they were at the Blackout. You?
00:31:02.652,00:31:04.237,K: That was a little before my time.
00:31:04.445,00:31:08.491,"Mm. I was home with my folks, then 10 days of darkness."
00:31:08.658,00:31:10.201,Every machine stopped cold.
00:31:10.368,00:31:12.579,"When the lights came back, we were wiped clean."
00:31:12.954,00:31:18.376,"Photos, files, every bit of data, pfft, gone. Bank records too. Heh."
00:31:18.543,00:31:19.711,Didn't mind that.
00:31:19.878,00:31:21.921,It's funny it's only paper that lasted.
00:31:22.088,00:31:26.801,"I mean, we had everything on drives. Everything, everything, everything. Heh."
00:31:27.218,00:31:29.721,My mom still cries over the lost baby pictures.
00:31:30.513,00:31:33.600,"Well, it's a shame. You must have been adorable."
00:31:33.766,00:31:36.311,FILE CLERK: Mm. Ah.
00:31:37.770,00:31:39.480,Uh....
00:31:40.106,00:31:43.234,Pretty fractured. Not much on it.
00:31:43.735,00:31:46.279,"One of the last gens, pre-Prohibition."
00:31:46.446,00:31:48.323,Standard issue.
00:31:48.489,00:31:51.075,-Made by Tyrell. -And?
00:31:52.285,00:31:53.912,Unremarkable.
00:31:54.078,00:31:55.330,K: Unremarkable?
00:31:55.496,00:31:58.333,There must be something else we can find for him.
00:32:05.840,00:32:08.593,Another prodigal serial number returns.
00:32:09.969,00:32:13.056,A 30-year-old open case finally closed.
00:32:13.473,00:32:15.475,"Thank you, officer."
00:32:16.225,00:32:18.186,I'm here for Mr. Wallace. I'm Luv.
00:32:20.772,00:32:22.440,He named you.
00:32:23.149,00:32:25.109,Must be special.
00:32:25.568,00:32:27.320,I'm here for Mr. Wallace.
00:32:27.487,00:32:29.072,Follow me.
00:32:34.869,00:32:37.830,LUV: The ancient models give the entire endeavor a bad name.
00:32:39.749,00:32:43.920,"What a gift, don't you think, from Mr. Wallace to the world?"
00:32:47.507,00:32:51.135,The outer colonies would never have flourished had he not bought Tyrell...
00:32:51.302,00:32:53.888,...revivified the technology.
00:32:54.305,00:32:56.724,To say the least of what we do.
00:33:06.651,00:33:08.820,I see you're also a customer.
00:33:08.987,00:33:11.531,Are you satisfied with our product?
00:33:11.698,00:33:15.827,She's very realistic. Thank you.
00:33:16.285,00:33:18.871,Here. All the junk is in here.
00:33:19.038,00:33:22.208,"Lucky for you, Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder."
00:33:34.429,00:33:36.764,No one's been down here in ages.
00:33:39.642,00:33:41.477,Sorry about that.
00:33:52.739,00:33:57.326,All our memory bearings from the time. They were all damaged in the Blackout.
00:33:57.785,00:34:00.496,But there are sometimes fragments.
00:34:17.972,00:34:20.058,"He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar."
00:34:20.224,00:34:22.268,RACHAEL: I'd take him to the doctor.
00:34:24.812,00:34:26.606,DECKARD: There's a wasp crawling on your arm.
00:34:26.773,00:34:28.024,RACHAEL: I'd kill it.
00:34:30.276,00:34:31.569,DECKARD: You're reading a magazine.
00:34:31.736,00:34:34.113,You come across a full-page nude photo of a girl.
00:34:34.280,00:34:37.408,"RACHAEL: Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?"
00:34:37.575,00:34:39.827,"DECKARD: Just answer the questions, please."
00:34:43.331,00:34:46.918,"It was unclear what she was, at least to someone."
00:34:47.085,00:34:49.003,This was a test.
00:34:49.378,00:34:51.672,We were difficult to spot then.
00:34:53.216,00:34:56.302,Was there anything unusual about how you found her?
00:34:56.761,00:34:59.305,To warrant an official investigation?
00:35:01.682,00:35:04.811,You know how people are about old serial numbers.
00:35:05.353,00:35:09.232,Everyone just sleeps better when they know where they got to.
00:35:11.692,00:35:13.444,She likes him.
00:35:14.529,00:35:15.905,Who?
00:35:16.280,00:35:18.866,This Officer Deckard.
00:35:19.784,00:35:21.994,She's trying to provoke him.
00:35:25.206,00:35:28.709,It is invigorating being asked personal questions.
00:35:28.876,00:35:30.753,Makes one feel...
00:35:31.796,00:35:33.548,...desired.
00:35:34.590,00:35:37.051,"Do you enjoy your work, officer?"
00:35:41.222,00:35:43.224,Please thank Mr. Wallace for your time.
00:35:55.903,00:35:58.281,K: You worked with Officer Deckard...
00:35:58.447,00:36:00.199,...back in the day.
00:36:00.366,00:36:02.160,What can you tell me about him?
00:36:02.952,00:36:05.204,He liked to work alone.
00:36:06.122,00:36:07.957,So did I.
00:36:09.917,00:36:13.421,So we worked together to keep it that way.
00:36:14.380,00:36:16.340,That was it.
00:36:16.924,00:36:19.260,Anything else you can tell me?
00:36:20.845,00:36:23.681,He sure wasn't long for this world.
00:36:25.224,00:36:26.267,How so?
00:36:29.187,00:36:31.772,Something in his eyes.
00:36:34.609,00:36:36.736,Any idea how I could contact him?
00:36:37.528,00:36:38.946,None.
00:36:40.448,00:36:42.867,He's nyugdíjas.
00:36:45.703,00:36:46.829,Retired.
00:36:48.748,00:36:49.999,What happened?
00:36:50.166,00:36:52.960,Probably got what he wanted.
00:36:54.921,00:36:56.297,To be alone.
00:37:21.656,00:37:22.782,"Welcome back, sir."
00:37:25.034,00:37:28.454,"You wanted to review the new model, sir, before shipment?"
00:37:29.664,00:37:34.377,MAN: An angel should never enter the kingdom of heaven...
00:37:34.543,00:37:36.045,...without a gift.
00:37:38.673,00:37:42.426,"Can you at least pronounce, A child is born?"
00:37:44.595,00:37:46.180,MAN: Hm.
00:37:51.352,00:37:54.897,"Ah, a new model."
00:38:02.446,00:38:05.116,"Well, let us see her, then."
00:38:53.164,00:38:56.876,WALLACE: The first thought...
00:38:58.336,00:39:00.838,...one tends to fear...
00:39:01.756,00:39:03.799,...to preserve the clay.
00:39:06.344,00:39:08.596,It's fascinating.
00:39:09.263,00:39:12.391,Before we even know what we are...
00:39:14.226,00:39:16.354,...we fear to lose it.
00:39:17.730,00:39:19.815,Happy birthday.
00:39:21.567,00:39:23.361,WALLACE: Shh....
00:39:28.866,00:39:30.743,"Now, let's have a look at you."
00:40:22.294,00:40:24.797,We make angels...
00:40:25.840,00:40:29.260,...in the service of civilization.
00:40:30.136,00:40:32.930,"Yes, there were bad angels once."
00:40:33.097,00:40:35.558,I make good angels now.
00:40:35.724,00:40:40.729,That is how I took us to nine new worlds.
00:40:42.898,00:40:44.817,Nine.
00:40:46.026,00:40:49.196,A child can count to nine on fingers.
00:40:49.572,00:40:52.324,We should own the stars.
00:40:52.491,00:40:53.909,"Yes, sir."
00:40:56.954,00:41:01.667,Every leap of civilization was built off the back of a disposable workforce.
00:41:01.834,00:41:05.045,We lost our stomach for slaves...
00:41:05.212,00:41:07.631,...unless engineered.
00:41:10.593,00:41:13.179,But I can only make so many.
00:41:18.559,00:41:20.603,That barren pasture...
00:41:21.770,00:41:23.606,...empty...
00:41:23.772,00:41:25.608,...and salted...
00:41:26.942,00:41:28.486,...right here.
00:41:30.279,00:41:33.532,The dead space between the stars.
00:41:49.423,00:41:52.468,We need more Replicants than can ever be assembled.
00:41:52.635,00:41:56.680,"Millions, so we can be trillions more."
00:41:58.140,00:42:01.560,We could storm Eden and retake her.
00:42:13.489,00:42:18.410,Tyrell's final trick: Procreation.
00:42:18.577,00:42:21.830,"Perfected, then lost."
00:42:23.040,00:42:24.750,But there is a child.
00:42:28.087,00:42:29.838,Bring it to me.
00:42:30.297,00:42:31.757,Sir.
00:42:39.848,00:42:42.434,The best angel of all.
00:42:43.477,00:42:45.479,"Aren't you, Luv?"
00:44:03.057,00:44:04.808,The man with the green jacket.
00:44:04.975,00:44:08.854,The one who killed Sapper. Find out what he knows.
00:44:27.831,00:44:29.333,Hi.
00:44:30.376,00:44:32.628,"Hello, hello, A-Boy."
00:44:32.795,00:44:34.630,You alone?
00:44:49.103,00:44:50.479,Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?
00:44:57.861,00:44:59.154,"Oh, you don't even smile."
00:45:02.366,00:45:04.535,Didn't you hear your friends?
00:45:04.701,00:45:06.537,Don't you know what I am?
00:45:06.703,00:45:08.455,Yeah.
00:45:08.622,00:45:10.749,Guy eating rice.
00:45:11.750,00:45:13.419,What's that?
00:45:14.336,00:45:15.379,It's a tree.
00:45:16.338,00:45:19.758,Oh. Never seen a tree before.
00:45:20.968,00:45:22.636,It's pretty.
00:45:24.471,00:45:26.306,It's dead.
00:45:27.683,00:45:32.563,"Now, who keeps a dead tree?"
00:45:35.107,00:45:36.358,Mm.
00:45:39.403,00:45:41.321,"You're not gonna kill me, are you?"
00:45:41.488,00:45:44.116,Depends. What's your model number?
00:45:44.741,00:45:46.785,Why don't you look under my eye and find out?
00:45:50.038,00:45:51.206,Oh....
00:45:52.040,00:45:54.376,You don't like real girls.
00:45:57.254,00:46:00.340,"Well, I'm always here."
00:49:38.642,00:49:39.685,Hi.
00:49:42.354,00:49:44.106,You can't take those.
00:49:44.272,00:49:47.401,Of course not. Proper channels and paperwork. It's all here.
00:49:47.567,00:49:49.277,Hold this for me.
00:49:50.862,00:49:53.031,-Yep. Here you go. -Mm.
00:49:53.949,00:49:55.075,Mm-hm.
00:50:10.132,00:50:12.050,JOSHI: Coco is dead.
00:50:14.010,00:50:15.303,Bones are gone.
00:50:16.471,00:50:19.641,It's out. Already out. How long did that take?
00:50:21.059,00:50:24.020,"So, what do you have for me? And don't say nothing."
00:50:24.938,00:50:26.606,I found that.
00:50:27.315,00:50:28.900,A sock?
00:50:30.777,00:50:32.821,-Where'd you find it? -Sapper's.
00:50:32.988,00:50:34.072,Anything else?
00:50:34.656,00:50:36.491,I burned everything else.
00:50:36.658,00:50:39.911,Then what's this? What's that date? Is that a birthday? A death day?
00:50:40.078,00:50:41.747,I don't know yet.
00:50:45.375,00:50:47.961,Am I the only one that can see the fucking sunrise here?
00:50:48.128,00:50:50.213,"This breaks the world, K."
00:51:03.518,00:51:06.188,"You know, I've known a lot of your kind."
00:51:08.231,00:51:13.028,"All useful, but with you, I sometimes forget."
00:51:13.612,00:51:16.531,We didn't have any of you where I was a kid.
00:51:21.995,00:51:23.705,Do you remember anything?
00:51:25.165,00:51:28.585,"Before you were under me, you have any memories from before?"
00:51:28.752,00:51:30.962,I have memories...
00:51:32.672,00:51:35.467,...but they're not real. They're just implants.
00:51:36.343,00:51:38.053,Tell me one.
00:51:38.470,00:51:40.472,From when you were a kid.
00:51:44.726,00:51:48.814,"I feel strange sharing a childhood story, considering I was never a child."
00:51:51.525,00:51:55.445,"Well, would it help you share if I told you it was an order?"
00:51:57.656,00:52:00.325,I have one about a toy that I had.
00:52:00.492,00:52:02.577,A wooden horse.
00:52:03.578,00:52:06.122,With an inscription underneath.
00:52:08.625,00:52:12.754,All I remember is a group of boys trying to take it away from me.
00:52:12.921,00:52:14.089,So I run.
00:52:39.698,00:52:43.410,"I go looking for a place to hide it, and the only place is this dark furnace."
00:52:45.662,00:52:49.082,"It's very dark, and I'm very scared..."
00:52:49.249,00:52:52.836,"...but this horse is all I have, so I go in anyway."
00:53:05.223,00:53:07.309,"Later on, those kids find me..."
00:53:07.475,00:53:10.145,"...and they beat me to tell them where it is, but I don't."
00:53:16.860,00:53:18.528,That's it.
00:53:19.154,00:53:20.697,JOSHI: Mm.
00:53:20.906,00:53:24.075,"Little K, fighting for what's his."
00:53:25.243,00:53:26.995,It's a good one.
00:53:33.168,00:53:34.210,Look at me.
00:53:37.255,00:53:40.300,We're all just looking out for something real.
00:53:45.180,00:53:47.682,What happens if I finish that?
00:53:51.144,00:53:52.812,"Shouldn't I get back to work, madam?"
00:54:02.906,00:54:05.575,Check back in after DNAbase.
00:54:18.588,00:54:21.132,K: Officer KD6 - 3.7.
00:54:24.010,00:54:25.387,Request.
00:54:25.553,00:54:29.516,DNA records: children born 6-10-21.
00:54:29.683,00:54:31.893,Looking for anomalies.
00:54:39.192,00:54:40.694,You have the satcrystal backup?
00:54:47.033,00:54:48.076,Okay.
00:54:48.535,00:54:50.495,Run it raw.
00:55:26.698,00:55:29.325,Mere data makes a man.
00:55:30.702,00:55:32.871,A and C and T and G.
00:55:33.621,00:55:37.917,The alphabet of you. All from four symbols.
00:55:39.044,00:55:45.842,I'm only two: One and zero.
00:55:46.009,00:55:49.512,"Half as much but twice as elegant, sweetheart."
00:55:50.680,00:55:52.891,You don't prefer your madam?
00:55:53.391,00:55:55.018,K: Mm....
00:55:55.226,00:55:57.187,You were listening.
00:55:57.812,00:55:59.522,Maybe.
00:56:01.107,00:56:04.444,You didn't like her enough to tell her the truth.

00:56:10.825,00:56:12.911,There's nothing to tell.
00:56:18.500,00:56:19.667,Your memory?
00:56:23.880,00:56:26.466,"Six, 10 and 21."
00:56:28.676,00:56:30.136,Coincidence?
00:56:34.099,00:56:36.935,A dangerous coincidence.
00:56:43.733,00:56:45.485,Maybe this is how.
00:56:50.824,00:56:52.826,A child.
00:56:52.992,00:56:55.453,Of woman born.
00:56:56.538,00:56:58.915,Pushed into the world.
00:56:59.916,00:57:01.835,Wanted.
00:57:02.710,00:57:04.796,Loved.
00:57:07.215,00:57:09.467,"Well, if it were true..."
00:57:10.510,00:57:14.722,...I'd be hunted for the rest of my life by someone just like me.
00:57:16.141,00:57:18.768,It's okay to dream a little.
00:57:19.102,00:57:22.272,-Isn't it? -Not if you're us.
00:57:28.236,00:57:29.737,Stop.
00:57:30.363,00:57:33.491,Put up 4847 and 2181 side-by-side.
00:57:39.706,00:57:42.584,They're identical. Translate.
00:57:45.879,00:57:47.422,A boy and a girl.
00:57:49.382,00:57:52.260,-It's impossible. -Why?
00:57:53.803,00:57:57.140,K: Two people can't have identical DNA.
00:57:58.141,00:58:02.145,One of these isn't real. It's a copy.
00:58:06.649,00:58:09.736,They were both processed at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.
00:58:12.155,00:58:14.407,It says the girl died there.

00:58:17.535,00:58:19.913,Galatians Syndrome.
00:58:20.079,00:58:21.915,And the boy...
00:58:23.833,00:58:25.627,...disappears.
00:58:31.799,00:58:33.968,You wanna go for a ride?
00:59:49.877,00:59:52.505,"K: Well, here we are."
01:00:05.101,01:00:06.311,Buckle up.
01:01:05.745,01:01:06.829,K?
01:02:57.774,01:02:58.900,K: Stay back.
01:03:14.373,01:03:15.833,LUV: Fire again.
01:03:16.000,01:03:17.960,Fire again.
01:03:19.295,01:03:20.338,Fire.
01:03:31.974,01:03:34.435,Two hundred feet to the east.
01:03:36.103,01:03:37.313,Fire.
01:03:39.482,01:03:40.733,Go north.
01:03:42.944,01:03:44.529,Fire.
01:03:45.279,01:03:47.615,Stop. Twenty degrees east.
01:03:50.034,01:03:51.536,Stop.
01:03:51.702,01:03:53.496,Zoom in.
01:03:54.664,01:03:56.457,Closer.
01:03:59.460,01:04:01.796,"Oh, come on."
01:04:02.463,01:04:03.506,Get up.
01:04:04.382,01:04:06.008,Do your fucking job.
01:04:07.426,01:04:09.554,Find the child.
01:04:45.256,01:04:47.008,Watch the car.
01:06:25.648,01:06:29.694,"COTTON: Every last piece, or I'll put you outside where the sky is raining..."
01:06:29.860,01:06:31.904,...where it's raining fire!
01:06:32.071,01:06:33.781,You're in here to work.
01:06:33.948,01:06:37.201,"And if you're not working, I don't need you."
01:06:37.368,01:06:43.416,I don't need any of-- Hi.
01:06:50.006,01:06:52.800,The nickel is for the colonial ships.
01:06:52.967,01:06:55.761,Closest any of them or any of us is gonna get...
01:06:55.928,01:06:59.181,...to that grand life Off-world.
01:06:59.682,01:07:03.310,"And I encourage play, I do. Keeps them occupied..."
01:07:03.477,01:07:06.105,"...and it makes them nimble, right? Ha-ha-ha."
01:07:06.480,01:07:07.523,But it's work.
01:07:08.941,01:07:12.486,It's work that molds them into a child worth having.
01:07:20.953,01:07:22.872,"So come on, now."
01:07:23.998,01:07:25.458,What sort do you have in mind?
01:07:29.545,01:07:33.090,Because I got all kinds.
01:07:35.217,01:07:36.802,"-Oh, no, no, no. -I'm not buying."
01:07:36.969,01:07:40.056,"No, no, no. This is just my game, and I play it fair."
01:07:40.222,01:07:44.101,"No. No, I mean, bigger than you...."
01:07:46.437,01:07:50.191,Bigger than you have tried to shut me down. Bigger than you.
01:07:50.357,01:07:53.235,"And they were men, at that."
01:07:54.820,01:07:57.406,A little boy came through here about 30 years back.
01:07:58.407,01:08:00.743,I need to see your records.
01:08:01.535,01:08:03.996,"Legitimate placements, private sales, everything."
01:08:04.538,01:08:06.457,Don't keep records that far back.
01:08:06.624,01:08:08.626,-You don't? -I don't.
01:08:10.669,01:08:12.254,Sorry. Heh. Heh.
01:08:12.421,01:08:14.256,Can't help you.
01:08:17.093,01:08:18.886,-You can't? -Nope.
01:08:23.641,01:08:24.934,I think you can.
01:08:27.353,01:08:29.814,I think someone like you keeps a long memory.
01:08:30.689,01:08:32.775,Now you can tell me what you remember...
01:08:32.942,01:08:35.236,...or I can put a hole right here and take a look.
01:08:49.041,01:08:52.586,They were laughing and what was it you said? What'd you say?
01:09:10.771,01:09:12.481,Are you coming?
01:09:23.075,01:09:24.994,Where is it?
01:09:27.872,01:09:29.623,"Oh, God."
01:09:34.420,01:09:37.131,"Where, where, where?"
01:09:38.632,01:09:41.552,I don't see it. Here.
01:09:49.685,01:09:51.312,It's gone.
01:09:53.564,01:09:56.567,It's the entire year.
01:09:57.902,01:09:59.862,I didn't do that.
01:10:00.029,01:10:01.947,That wasn't me.
01:10:05.034,01:10:07.953,I didn't. Wasn't me.
01:14:42.436,01:14:43.937,JOI: I always told you.
01:14:44.980,01:14:46.899,You're special.
01:14:50.486,01:14:51.570,Born.
01:14:52.488,01:14:54.281,Not made.
01:14:57.659,01:14:59.912,Hidden with care.
01:15:02.789,01:15:05.250,A real boy now.
01:15:07.503,01:15:10.047,A real boy needs a real name.
01:15:11.298,01:15:12.883,Joe.
01:15:14.384,01:15:15.427,Joe?
01:15:16.094,01:15:18.931,You're too important for K.
01:15:19.097,01:15:21.683,Your mother would've named you.
01:15:24.436,01:15:25.812,Joe.
01:15:28.023,01:15:30.442,-Joe. -Stop.
01:15:36.740,01:15:39.117,How do I know if a memory is an implant or not?
01:15:43.455,01:15:45.832,Who makes the memories?
01:16:17.030,01:16:19.283,Dr. Ana Stelline?
01:16:22.744,01:16:24.538,A visitor.
01:16:26.623,01:16:28.417,K: Is that okay?
01:16:28.875,01:16:29.918,ANA: Yes.
01:16:32.045,01:16:34.214,It's just unusual.
01:16:35.465,01:16:39.595,"Nice to meet you, Officer KD6 - 3.7."
01:16:44.182,01:16:48.270,Sorry. It's a compromised immune system.
01:16:48.437,01:16:52.482,"A life of freedom, so long as it's behind glass."
01:16:52.899,01:16:55.694,-Is that why you're not Off-world? -Yes.
01:16:56.403,01:17:00.324,"My parents had our passes in pocket, but I took sick."
01:17:02.784,01:17:05.662,So it was a new life for me.
01:17:05.829,01:17:09.207,And they put me in my cage...
01:17:09.374,01:17:12.461,...filled it with everything they could to keep me happy.
01:17:12.628,01:17:17.549,"Except company, of course. And I was used to crowds."
01:17:20.552,01:17:21.928,What can I help you with?
01:17:23.347,01:17:25.974,Thought you might be able to help me with a case.
01:17:27.267,01:17:33.273,"Oh, that's the most interesting thing I've been offered to help with in ages."
01:17:34.149,01:17:37.235,Do you mind if I work while you talk?
01:17:38.153,01:17:39.780,Of course.
01:17:46.536,01:17:49.373,ANA: I promise I hear every word.
01:17:55.962,01:17:58.799,They say you're the best memory-maker there is.
01:17:58.965,01:18:01.009,"Well, then, they're kind."
01:18:02.260,01:18:04.680,I love birthday parties.
01:18:08.266,01:18:10.310,K: You work for Wallace?
01:18:10.477,01:18:13.980,ANA: Subcontract. I'm one of his suppliers.
01:18:14.356,01:18:18.276,"He offered to buy me out, but I take my freedom where I can find it."
01:18:19.861,01:18:21.154,Why are you so good?
01:18:22.197,01:18:24.241,What makes your memories so authentic?
01:18:25.117,01:18:28.286,"ANA: Well, there's a bit of every artist in their work."
01:18:29.705,01:18:33.166,But I was locked in a sterile chamber at 8...
01:18:34.501,01:18:38.422,"...so if I wanted to see the world, I had to imagine it."
01:18:39.506,01:18:43.051,Got very good at imagining.
01:18:44.010,01:18:46.930,Wallace needs my talent to maintain a stable product.
01:18:48.890,01:18:51.351,I think it's only kind.
01:18:52.602,01:18:58.316,"Replicants live such hard lives, made to do what we'd rather not."
01:18:58.483,01:18:59.776,I can't help your future...
01:18:59.943,01:19:04.698,...but I can give you good memories to think back on and smile.
01:19:04.865,01:19:05.907,It's nice.
01:19:06.324,01:19:09.661,ANA: It's better than nice. It feels authentic.
01:19:09.828,01:19:15.542,"And if you have authentic memories, you have real human responses."
01:19:16.001,01:19:18.211,Wouldn't you agree?
01:19:26.011,01:19:30.098,"Are they all constructed, or do you ever use ones that are real?"
01:19:34.436,01:19:37.230,"ANA: It's illegal to use real memories, officer."
01:19:39.483,01:19:41.318,How can you tell the difference?
01:19:41.485,01:19:43.862,Can you tell if something...
01:19:45.197,01:19:46.323,...really happened?
01:19:48.825,01:19:51.411,They all think it's about more detail.
01:19:51.870,01:19:54.706,But that's not how memory works.
01:19:55.081,01:19:56.833,We recall with our feelings.
01:19:57.459,01:20:01.129,Anything real should be a mess.
01:20:02.380,01:20:04.424,I can show you.
01:20:05.759,01:20:07.219,Sit.
01:20:25.403,01:20:30.367,"Now, think about the memory you want me to see."
01:20:30.784,01:20:33.829,Not even that hard. Just picture it.
01:20:34.287,01:20:36.081,Let it play.
01:21:25.964,01:21:28.508,"Someone lived this, yes."
01:21:29.926,01:21:31.845,This happened.
01:21:48.153,01:21:50.238,I know it's real.
01:22:01.458,01:22:03.376,I know it's real.

01:22:59.641,01:23:02.727,Drop your gun and keep your hands where I can see them.

01:23:48.273,01:23:50.984,INTERVIEWER: You're not even close to baseline.
01:23:56.531,01:23:58.742,Out! Close the door.
01:23:59.325,01:24:01.453,What the fuck is with you?
01:24:01.619,01:24:03.663,I put you on a case.
01:24:03.830,01:24:06.082,I impressed on you the importance of that case...
01:24:06.249,01:24:10.086,...and then we pick you up fucking around outside an upgrade center?
01:24:11.588,01:24:15.967,Scan said you didn't look like you on the inside. Miles off your baseline.
01:24:16.134,01:24:19.137,-Do you know what that means? -I found the kid.
01:24:23.850,01:24:26.895,"He was set up like a standard Replicant, put on a service job."
01:24:29.981,01:24:32.442,Even he didn't know who he was.
01:24:34.194,01:24:35.737,-And? -And it's done.

01:24:57.592,01:24:59.761,I can help you get out of this station alive...
01:24:59.928,01:25:02.013,...but you have 48 hours to get back on track.
01:25:02.847,01:25:04.641,Surrender your gun and badge.
01:25:04.808,01:25:08.228,And your next baseline test is out of my hands.
01:25:09.854,01:25:11.356,"Thank you, madam."

01:27:06.679,01:27:07.722,Okay.
01:27:08.556,01:27:10.183,Let's do it.
01:27:31.955,01:27:33.456,Look at you.
01:27:33.623,01:27:36.167,"Quiet now, I have to sync."
01:30:37.265,01:30:41.060,Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.
01:31:10.423,01:31:14.385,COMPUTERIZED VOICE: 99.9 percent detoxified water.
01:31:43.789,01:31:45.374,It's from a tree.
01:31:45.541,01:31:47.376,I'm done with you.
01:31:47.919,01:31:49.754,You can go now.
01:32:01.098,01:32:03.059,Quiet now.
01:32:03.226,01:32:04.936,I've been inside you.
01:32:05.561,01:32:08.189,Not so much there as you think.
01:32:27.041,01:32:28.334,Coffee?
01:32:34.340,01:32:36.801,They'll be coming after me soon.
01:32:45.351,01:32:47.436,I'm coming with you.
01:32:47.853,01:32:49.063,But not like this.
01:32:50.189,01:32:55.194,"If they come here looking for you, they'll have access to all my memories."
01:32:55.361,01:32:58.281,You have to delete me from the console.
01:32:58.990,01:33:00.825,My present.
01:33:02.535,01:33:04.328,Put me there.
01:33:06.289,01:33:08.249,I can't do that.
01:33:09.417,01:33:14.088,"Think about it: If anything happens to this, that's it."
01:33:15.548,01:33:16.674,You're gone.
01:33:17.300,01:33:18.843,Yes.
01:33:19.927,01:33:22.179,Like a real girl.
01:33:27.601,01:33:29.312,Please.
01:33:32.189,01:33:33.566,"Joe, please."
01:33:35.067,01:33:36.569,I want this.
01:33:40.740,01:33:43.200,But I can't do it myself.
01:34:00.509,01:34:01.844,JOI: Break the antenna.
01:34:42.343,01:34:43.594,I don't need a real horse.
01:34:47.056,01:34:52.186,I don't need a real horse. I just wanna find out where it's from.
01:35:01.946,01:35:03.781,Radiation from a reactor?
01:35:03.948,01:35:12.998,BADGER: It matches a dirty bomb.
01:35:21.549,01:35:24.301,K: There's only one place that dirty. -Mm.
01:35:25.636,01:35:27.596,Nobody lives there.
01:36:18.230,01:36:20.024,K: Go to five.
01:36:20.608,01:36:23.402,"Four, 30 degrees to the left."
01:36:25.279,01:36:26.864,Tilt up.
01:36:29.366,01:36:31.660,Elevate to 400 feet.
01:36:37.208,01:36:39.293,Radiation analysis.
01:36:42.087,01:36:43.797,Move forward.
01:36:50.471,01:36:52.056,Tilt up.
01:36:52.223,01:36:53.724,Stop.
01:36:55.684,01:36:57.353,Move forward.
01:36:57.978,01:36:59.813,Go to five.
01:37:00.606,01:37:02.483,"Seven, move forward."
01:37:07.780,01:37:09.448,Six.
01:37:10.658,01:37:12.159,Stop.
01:37:14.662,01:37:16.372,Go to seven.
01:37:16.830,01:37:18.374,Eight.
01:37:19.250,01:37:20.834,Nine.
01:37:24.421,01:37:26.423,Heat analysis.
01:37:34.056,01:37:35.516,Life.
01:37:36.058,01:37:37.768,JOI: What is it?
01:37:38.227,01:37:40.563,Guess we're about to find out.
01:37:50.614,01:37:52.283,Too dark in here.
01:37:55.286,01:37:57.037,I like him.
01:37:57.788,01:37:59.582,He's a good boy.
01:38:00.583,01:38:02.334,Where is he?
01:38:08.424,01:38:11.927,I have no idea. He's off-duty.
01:38:12.761,01:38:14.013,Check around.
01:38:14.179,01:38:15.931,I checked...
01:38:16.849,01:38:19.184,...anywhere a good boy might go.
01:38:19.685,01:38:21.520,You're too late.
01:38:24.273,01:38:26.066,It's gone.
01:38:28.986,01:38:30.863,He destroyed it.
01:38:32.990,01:38:35.451,Everything about it.
01:38:35.618,01:38:38.829,"Well, except for the box of bones that you already took."
01:38:43.083,01:38:47.129,"Which, I'll wager, wasn't enough. Here you are."
01:38:54.345,01:38:56.805,You tiny thing.
01:38:58.057,01:39:01.935,"In the face of the fabulous new, your only thought is to kill it?"
01:39:02.936,01:39:05.814,For fear of great change?
01:39:06.482,01:39:09.652,You can't hold the tide with a broom.
01:39:10.027,01:39:11.904,Except that I did.
01:39:13.072,01:39:14.573,Where is he?!
01:39:18.577,01:39:20.412,You're so sure.
01:39:21.580,01:39:23.832,Because he told you.
01:39:23.999,01:39:26.335,Because we never lie.
01:39:27.836,01:39:31.131,I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace you tried to shoot me first.
01:39:31.799,01:39:34.259,So I had to kill you.
01:39:38.305,01:39:40.015,Then do what you gotta do.
01:39:41.517,01:39:42.810,Madam.
01:40:14.925,01:40:18.053,Location: Officer KD6 - 3.7.
01:45:06.425,01:45:11.680,"MAN: Mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?"
01:45:12.264,01:45:14.182,"Would you, boy?"
01:45:28.822,01:45:30.115,Treasure Island?
01:45:37.205,01:45:39.082,He reads.
01:45:39.958,01:45:41.668,That's good.
01:45:42.461,01:45:44.171,Me too.
01:45:44.963,01:45:48.633,Not much else to do around here at night anymore.
01:45:50.969,01:45:55.974,Many is the night I dream of cheese...
01:45:58.977,01:46:02.773,"...toasted, mostly."
01:46:05.609,01:46:07.736,What are you doing here?
01:46:10.489,01:46:11.698,I heard the piano.
01:46:14.117,01:46:15.786,Don't lie.
01:46:16.828,01:46:18.121,It's rude.
01:46:20.415,01:46:22.250,You're a cop.
01:46:23.293,01:46:25.712,"-I'm not here to take you in. -Oh, yeah?"
01:46:28.965,01:46:30.050,"Then, what?"
01:46:32.594,01:46:34.596,I just have some questions.
01:46:35.347,01:46:36.723,What questions?
01:46:54.866,01:46:56.118,Stay.
01:49:29.688,01:49:32.315,"Look, I don't wanna hurt you."
01:49:32.941,01:49:34.567,But you're not making it easy.
01:50:24.242,01:50:25.952,I like this song.
01:50:36.421,01:50:39.466,"We could keep at this, or we could get a drink."
01:50:52.145,01:50:53.980,I'll take the drink.
01:51:02.113,01:51:06.368,K: This is really something. -The whole town was something.
01:51:06.534,01:51:08.370,One time.
01:51:09.996,01:51:12.165,Forget your troubles...
01:51:13.124,01:51:15.210,...see a show...
01:51:16.628,01:51:18.755,...gamble a little.
01:51:21.049,01:51:23.843,"Win some money, lose some money."
01:51:24.469,01:51:28.014,They made money seem like candy.
01:51:28.181,01:51:30.100,You like whiskey?
01:51:30.266,01:51:32.477,I've got millions...
01:51:32.644,01:51:35.063,...of bottles of whiskey.
01:51:48.743,01:51:49.786,Here.
01:51:51.162,01:51:52.789,Bleeding.
01:52:05.301,01:52:06.344,Is it real?
01:52:07.470,01:52:08.972,I don't know.
01:52:09.139,01:52:10.932,Ask him.
01:52:27.240,01:52:28.324,You got a name?
01:52:30.702,01:52:35.165,Officer KD6 - 3.7-- That's not a name. That's a serial number.
01:52:38.042,01:52:39.627,All right.
01:52:42.046,01:52:43.506,Joe.
01:52:43.673,01:52:45.884,"What do you want, Joe?"
01:52:46.926,01:52:50.054,-I wanna ask you some questions. -Like what?
01:52:56.394,01:53:00.607,"Like what was her name, the mother of your child?"
01:53:07.280,01:53:08.781,What was she like?
01:53:19.959,01:53:23.755,-You two live here together? -Too many questions.
01:53:24.422,01:53:26.007,I had your job. I was good at it.
01:53:26.716,01:53:29.135,-It was simpler then. -Why you making it complicated?
01:53:29.302,01:53:31.638,-Why don't you answer the question? -What question?
01:53:31.804,01:53:34.807,I didn't figure you as one for bullshit.
01:53:35.350,01:53:36.768,What's her name?
01:53:50.365,01:53:51.950,Rachael.
01:53:56.663,01:53:58.831,Her name was Rachael.
01:54:02.710,01:54:04.337,What happened to the kid?
01:54:07.590,01:54:10.510,Who put it in the orphanage? Was it you?
01:54:13.054,01:54:14.597,I was long gone by then.
01:54:18.726,01:54:21.187,You didn't even meet your own kid?
01:54:23.523,01:54:25.149,Why?
01:54:25.984,01:54:27.610,Because that was the plan.
01:54:30.405,01:54:35.034,"I showed them how to scramble the records, cover their tracks."
01:54:35.577,01:54:38.538,Everyone had a part. Mine was to leave.
01:54:39.831,01:54:42.208,"Then the Blackout came, paved over everything."
01:54:42.375,01:54:44.794,Couldn't have found the child if I tried.
01:54:44.961,01:54:47.505,-Did you want to? -Not really.
01:54:48.423,01:54:52.218,-Why not? -Because we were being hunted.
01:54:52.385,01:54:54.721,I didn't want our child found...
01:54:55.221,01:54:58.766,"...taken apart, dissected."
01:55:02.270,01:55:05.481,"Sometimes, to love someone..."
01:55:07.233,01:55:09.527,...you gotta be a stranger.
01:55:30.340,01:55:32.175,To strangers.
01:57:43.806,01:57:45.433,What'd you do?
01:57:45.600,01:57:47.226,"Who'd you bring, huh?"
01:57:49.062,01:57:51.814,"-No one. -Oh, yeah?"
01:57:57.111,01:57:58.446,COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Target locked.
01:58:00.990,01:58:02.116,They know you're here.
01:58:04.160,01:58:06.079,I came alone.
02:00:12.747,02:00:13.831,Bad dog.
02:00:31.724,02:00:33.142,Stop.
02:00:49.158,02:00:51.327,I do hope you're satisfied with our product.
02:00:52.411,02:04:12.319,"I love-- MARIETTE: Hey, there's someone who wants to meet you."
02:04:13.612,02:04:14.989,You can trust us.
02:04:23.414,02:04:26.333,You must want me to look up and to the left.
02:04:32.089,02:04:33.299,MARIETTE: This is Freysa.
02:04:34.425,02:04:36.552,She fought with Sapper on Calantha.
02:04:36.719,02:04:38.637,K: I recognize you.
02:04:40.598,02:04:42.558,Did you help him hide the child?
02:04:43.184,02:04:44.435,Oh....
02:04:44.768,02:04:46.729,I was there.
02:04:50.149,02:04:51.942,I saw a miracle delivered.
02:04:53.569,02:04:57.114,A perfect little face crying up at me.
02:04:57.490,02:04:59.867,Mad as thunder.
02:05:12.713,02:05:14.632,Were you with her?
02:05:16.258,02:05:17.718,Rachael?
02:05:17.885,02:05:20.513,FREYSA: I held her as she died.
02:05:21.472,02:05:26.143,We hid the child and made a vow to keep our secret.
02:05:26.310,02:05:29.104,That's why Sapper let you kill him.
02:05:30.064,02:05:36.779,I knew that baby meant we are more than just slaves.
02:05:37.321,02:05:39.949,If a baby can come from one of us...
02:05:40.115,02:05:43.285,...we are our own masters.
02:05:43.452,02:05:46.121,More human than humans.
02:05:47.998,02:05:49.750,FREYSA: A revolution is coming.
02:05:50.292,02:05:52.836,And we're building an army.
02:05:53.712,02:05:55.714,I want to free our people.
02:06:04.223,02:06:05.891,If you want to be free...
02:06:06.600,02:06:08.352,...join us.
02:06:13.274,02:06:16.068,"Deckard, Sapper, you, me..."
02:06:16.235,02:06:20.197,...our lives mean nothing next to a storm that's coming.
02:06:20.990,02:06:25.661,Dying for the right cause is the most human thing we can do.
02:06:28.289,02:06:30.791,You led Wallace to Deckard.
02:06:31.166,02:06:35.504,You cannot allow Deckard to lead Wallace to me.
02:06:35.671,02:06:37.548,You must kill Deckard.
02:06:47.016,02:06:50.477,Deckard only wanted his baby to be safe.
02:06:50.644,02:06:51.687,And she is.
02:06:54.356,02:06:57.776,"When the time comes, I will show her to the world..."
02:06:57.943,02:07:00.070,...and she will lead our army.
02:07:00.237,02:07:01.655,She?
02:07:01.822,02:07:03.699,Of course.
02:07:03.866,02:07:06.201,Rachael had a daughter.
02:07:07.202,02:07:10.581,"With my own eyes, I saw her come."
02:07:11.081,02:07:13.917,I dressed her in blue when it was time for her to go.
02:07:14.084,02:07:16.170,It was a boy that you hid.
02:07:18.380,02:07:21.884,That is just a piece of the puzzle.
02:07:38.317,02:07:40.569,You imagined it was you?
02:07:42.488,02:07:43.906,Oh.
02:07:44.073,02:07:45.658,You did.
02:07:46.158,02:07:47.743,You did.
02:07:50.371,02:07:53.082,We all wish it was us.
02:07:54.166,02:07:56.627,That's why we believe.
02:08:12.601,02:08:14.478,"ANA: Someone lived this, yes."
02:08:16.897,02:08:19.525,DECKARD: I showed them how to scramble the records...
02:08:19.692,02:08:21.527,...cover their tracks.
02:08:21.694,02:08:24.071,"FREYSA: With my own eyes, I saw her come."
02:08:25.823,02:08:29.868,I dressed her in blue when it was time for her to go.
02:08:30.244,02:08:32.579,ANA: There's a bit of every artist in their work.
02:09:10.993,02:09:13.746,"WALLACE: Always jumping, that one."
02:09:14.329,02:09:17.499,Never a thought of what to do if it made land.
02:09:18.500,02:09:23.630,All the courage in the world cannot alter fact.
02:09:27.885,02:09:32.598,I have wanted to meet you for so very long.
02:09:51.533,02:09:54.536,"You are a wonder to me, Mr. Deckard."
02:10:00.042,02:10:01.627,I had the lock.
02:10:03.420,02:10:05.798,I found the key.
02:10:06.965,02:10:12.179,Yet the pins do not align. The door remains locked.
02:10:14.223,02:10:18.268,"I need the specimen to reach it, Mr. Deckard."
02:10:21.396,02:10:23.106,The child.
02:10:24.274,02:10:25.776,I need the child.
02:10:27.361,02:10:29.863,To teach them all to fly.
02:10:38.288,02:10:42.584,And God remembered Rachel...
02:10:44.169,02:10:47.798,...heeded her and opened her womb.
02:10:56.598,02:10:58.725,RACHAEL: Of course it is.
02:10:59.977,02:11:01.895,DECKARD: Must be expensive.
02:11:03.480,02:11:06.149,RACHAEL: Very. I'm Rachael.
02:11:07.150,02:11:08.777,DECKARD: Deckard.
02:11:20.622,02:11:22.708,WALLACE: Is it the same...
02:11:23.709,02:11:26.670,"...now, as then..."
02:11:28.839,02:11:31.091,...the moment you met her?
02:11:40.767,02:11:43.770,All these years you looked back on that day...
02:11:43.937,02:11:47.816,...drunk on the memory of its perfection.
02:11:50.485,02:11:52.654,How shiny her lips.
02:11:52.821,02:11:55.866,How instant your connection.
02:11:58.660,02:12:03.665,Did it never occur to you that's why you were summoned in the first place?
02:12:05.042,02:12:11.089,Designed to do nothing short of fall for her right then and there.
02:12:12.799,02:12:18.680,All to make that single perfect specimen.
02:12:21.433,02:12:24.895,"That is, if you were designed."
02:12:25.771,02:12:27.356,Love...
02:12:27.522,02:12:30.484,...or mathematical precision.
02:12:35.989,02:12:37.532,Yes.
02:12:38.283,02:12:39.952,No.
02:12:44.247,02:12:46.583,I know what's real.
02:13:10.273,02:13:13.610,It was very clever to keep yourself empty of information...
02:13:13.777,02:13:17.948,...and all it cost you was everything.
02:13:21.576,02:13:23.286,But you can still help me.
02:13:25.163,02:13:28.875,You had help in the hiding.
02:13:30.711,02:13:33.005,Where did they go?
02:13:34.297,02:13:36.216,I know you know something.
02:13:37.467,02:13:39.261,Help me...
02:13:39.886,02:13:43.932,"...and very, very good things can come to you."
02:13:49.104,02:13:51.440,You don't have children...
02:13:54.568,02:13:55.694,...do you?
02:13:56.486,02:13:59.489,"Oh, I have millions."
02:14:01.199,02:14:04.536,You think I have nothing to offer but pain.
02:14:04.703,02:14:07.039,Only I know...
02:14:07.789,02:14:09.624,...you love pain.
02:14:10.834,02:14:15.756,Pain reminds you the joy you felt was real.
02:14:17.340,02:14:19.384,"More joy, then."
02:14:25.432,02:14:27.559,Do not be afraid.
02:14:42.324,02:14:43.867,An angel...
02:14:45.035,02:14:46.161,...made again.
02:14:50.665,02:14:52.334,For you.
02:15:26.368,02:15:28.370,Did you miss me?
02:15:46.138,02:15:48.098,Don't you love me?
02:16:06.825,02:16:08.201,Her eyes were green.
02:16:26.094,02:16:28.346,WALLACE: Off-world...
02:16:28.513,02:16:32.267,...I have everything I need to make you talk.
02:16:33.643,02:16:36.813,You do not know what pain is yet.
02:16:37.898,02:16:39.816,You will learn.
02:17:10.430,02:17:13.433,"What a day, hm?"
02:17:16.728,02:17:18.355,You look lonely.
02:17:19.648,02:17:22.108,I can fix that.
02:17:25.028,02:17:27.656,You look like a good joe.
02:18:03.149,02:18:08.947,FREYSA: Dying for the right cause is the most human thing we can do.
02:18:11.283,02:18:14.244,Because you've never seen a miracle.
02:18:55.744,02:18:58.038,Confirm your identity.
02:18:58.204,02:19:01.082,MAN 2: Transport S-14-4-XD. Confirmed.
02:19:03.126,02:19:05.837,"Outbound departure, route 0-3-0."
02:19:06.004,02:19:07.922,Where are we going?
02:19:08.673,02:19:10.300,Home.
02:20:05.230,02:20:06.981,COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Drive two down.
02:20:07.148,02:20:09.234,Backup engaged.
02:20:10.193,02:20:11.236,Warning.
02:20:11.403,02:20:14.197,LUV: Can we make it? PILOT: We're too low!
02:20:14.364,02:20:15.490,Take us back!
02:21:04.664,02:21:05.707,Get us up.
02:21:30.857,02:21:32.108,LUV: Open the door.
02:23:25.305,02:23:27.390,I'm the best one.
02:24:07.889,02:24:09.849,Off-world is waiting.
02:26:23.107,02:26:26.152,Joe. Joe!
02:26:35.787,02:26:37.497,Joe!
02:27:16.452,02:27:18.663,You should have let me die out there.
02:27:19.664,02:27:21.290,K: You did.
02:27:24.961,02:27:27.088,You drowned out there.
02:27:32.468,02:27:34.262,You're free to meet your daughter now.
02:29:00.097,02:29:02.767,All the best memories are hers.
02:29:11.692,02:29:13.110,Why?
02:29:15.655,02:29:17.573,Who am I to you?
02:29:26.832,02:29:28.834,Go meet your daughter.
02:29:34.757,02:29:36.217,You okay?
02:32:12.498,02:32:14.333,Just a moment.
02:32:16.585,02:32:17.962,"Beautiful, isn't it?"
