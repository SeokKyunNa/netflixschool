00:07:03.172,00:07:04.590,"Borras, stay."
00:07:36.456,00:07:39.584,"-Don't let him get out. -Hi, Borras."
00:07:58.561,00:08:00.855,-What are you saying? -Go upstairs.
00:08:02.398,00:08:04.317,Stop talking like that.
00:08:07.069,00:08:08.154,Go.
00:08:35.139,00:08:38.351,"Besides, you introduced us."
00:08:47.318,00:08:48.236,Borras.
00:08:48.986,00:08:50.112,"Borras, Borras."
00:08:50.196,00:08:52.865,"Borras, stay."
00:08:53.533,00:08:54.700,Come in.
00:09:07.797,00:09:09.882,Manita! Adela!
00:09:13.052,00:09:15.346,at cars that were driving by.
00:09:15.429,00:09:23.813,"Then an army jeep drove by, the kid throws a balloon at it, the soldier gets mad, he gets out, and shoots him."
00:09:23.896,00:09:25.314,"Oh, God! Is he okay?"
00:09:25.398,00:09:27.858,He shot him in the head. He's dead.
00:09:27.942,00:09:29.110,How awful.
00:09:33.072,00:09:37.410,"Mrs. Sofía is here, and the kids want strawberries."
00:09:38.202,00:09:39.120,Hurry.
00:09:42.331,00:09:43.332,Thank you.
00:09:45.418,00:09:47.670,-I got an A plus. -That's great!
00:09:47.753,00:09:49.797,"And Sofi did too, I imagine."
00:09:50.965,00:09:53.843,"Cleo, my husband's two suits need to be taken to the cleaners."
00:09:53.926,00:09:55.136,"-Yes. -But do it today, please."
00:09:55.219,00:09:57.888,"-He needs to pack, he's leaving Friday. -Yes, ma'am."
00:09:58.389,00:10:00.099,-Thank you. -Dad's going away?
00:10:00.182,00:10:02.351,Mm-hmm. To a conference in Quebec.
00:10:09.191,00:10:10.484,"I didn't know, so what?"
00:10:10.568,00:10:12.820,"Not for Sofi, she'll get fat."
00:10:44.977,00:10:46.520,Your mom won't like it.
00:10:48.397,00:10:50.483,Don't go near the edge.
00:11:11.295,00:11:15.091,-You were supposed to die. -Why me?
00:11:15.174,00:11:18.135,-'Cause it's my game. -Then I don't want to play anymore.
00:11:18.219,00:11:20.805,"Well, I don't want you to play it, you little sissy."
00:11:53.129,00:11:54.839,Aren't you going to tell me?
00:11:54.922,00:11:57.633,Can't talk. I'm dead.
00:12:00.511,00:12:03.806,I can't. I'm dead.
00:12:14.150,00:12:15.568,What are you doing?
00:12:18.320,00:12:19.739,What are you doing?
00:12:20.740,00:12:23.993,What are you doing? Tell me.
00:12:24.410,00:12:26.495,I can't. I'm dead.
00:12:34.336,00:12:35.838,-Hey. -Hmm?
00:12:36.380,00:12:38.174,I like being dead.
00:12:38.632,00:12:39.675,Huh.
00:13:31.727,00:13:32.728,"Here, Borras."
00:13:34.480,00:13:35.564,Here.
00:13:36.649,00:13:37.650,Come along.
00:13:47.952,00:13:49.537,Dad's home early!
00:14:27.157,00:14:30.077,-Who's here? -Daddy.
00:15:49.907,00:15:52.534,-Money for the hurdy gurdy? -I don't see any.
00:15:52.618,00:15:54.495,"No, money to get one."
00:15:55.579,00:15:57.539,-Address me as Your Excellence. -Your Excellence.
00:15:57.623,00:16:00.042,"Thank you, sir."
00:16:00.376,00:16:02.419,‐Have you heard the latest news? ‐What about?
00:16:05.464,00:16:07.466,"I'm very well, thank you."
00:16:42.918,00:16:45.379,"Cleo, can you bring the Doctor a tea?"
00:17:39.224,00:17:47.900,"to whom God's love commits me here, ever this day, be at my side, to light and guard, and rule and guide."
00:18:15.177,00:18:17.262,"Time to sleep, my darling."
00:18:17.805,00:18:19.264,"Good night, Cleo."
00:18:19.348,00:18:21.016,"Good night, Sofi."
00:18:24.853,00:18:26.647,Sweet dreams.
00:18:26.730,00:18:27.815,You too.
00:18:33.946,00:18:35.656,"Toño, go to sleep!"
00:18:47.292,00:18:50.712,The fridge is full of empty cartons.
00:18:50.796,00:18:54.258,And there's dog crap everywhere.
00:20:24.223,00:20:25.224,Borras.
00:20:47.246,00:20:50.707,-Yes. My boy. -Little devil.
00:20:50.791,00:20:52.626,Yes. But I love him.
00:20:53.418,00:20:54.836,Turn off the light.
00:21:05.681,00:21:10.269,"Yeah, she's there stalking you."
00:21:11.186,00:21:14.064,-Hurry up. -She probably stays awake.
00:21:16.984,00:21:18.568,Taking care of us.
00:21:19.778,00:21:21.530,Taking care we don't waste electricity.
00:21:24.157,00:21:25.659,-Ready? -Yes.
00:21:27.828,00:21:28.745,One.
00:21:31.081,00:21:31.999,Two.
00:22:38.065,00:22:43.320,Professor Zovek is used to challenges.
00:23:29.741,00:23:33.912,The bastard sends exactly the same letter to all the girls.
00:23:38.041,00:23:41.002,Why so lonely eating your tortitas?
00:23:41.962,00:23:44.506,"Hello, Ramón! Hello, Fermín!"
00:23:44.589,00:23:46.508,"-You guys want a bite? -Thanks, we ate."
00:23:46.842,00:23:50.804,"If you're done, let's go. I like watching the previews."
00:23:51.138,00:23:52.055,Let's go.
00:24:23.295,00:24:25.130,You really feel like seeing a movie?
00:24:25.213,00:24:27.674,I like movies. Don't you?
00:24:27.757,00:24:29.342,But it's so nice outside.
00:24:30.760,00:24:33.472,"Yes, it's nice. Want to go to the park?"
00:24:34.055,00:24:36.683,Sure. Give me a sec.
00:24:41.396,00:24:43.315,"What, you're not coming?"
00:24:44.024,00:24:47.444,-It's really nice outside. -Look at you.
00:24:47.736,00:24:51.072,I'd rather play in the dark. Tell me everything later.
00:24:56.119,00:24:57.037,Shall we?
00:26:05.146,00:26:06.731,You train every day?
00:26:09.109,00:26:10.777,I owe my life to martial arts.
00:26:12.779,00:26:14.406,I grew up with nothing.
00:26:17.742,00:26:20.996,My mother died when I was a kid.
00:26:23.039,00:26:26.209,I moved with my aunt to the slums.
00:26:27.627,00:26:29.379,"There, my cousins beat me."
00:26:30.130,00:26:31.590,And I met the wrong crowd.
00:26:32.382,00:26:34.509,"And I started drinking, and then huffing."
00:26:35.302,00:26:36.386,I was dying.
00:26:39.764,00:26:41.600,But then I discovered martial arts.
00:26:44.561,00:26:45.937,And everything came into...
00:26:48.607,00:26:49.524,focus.
00:26:53.862,00:26:55.405,Just like when you look at me.
00:28:54.315,00:28:56.276,"Good morning, my princess."
00:28:56.359,00:28:58.528,"Morning, Cleo."
00:28:58.611,00:28:59.863,Time to wake up.
00:29:02.407,00:29:04.325,-I need to pee. -Okay.
00:29:20.884,00:29:21.885,Paco.
00:29:22.469,00:29:24.179,"Wake up, my angel."
00:29:25.388,00:29:26.556,Come on.
00:29:28.224,00:29:29.225,Paco.
00:29:30.059,00:29:31.519,It's time.
00:29:47.660,00:29:48.661,Let's see.
00:30:19.526,00:30:22.195,-I want one! -They're mine.
00:30:22.570,00:30:26.115,-I got them for everyone. -But I put them in the freezer.
00:30:26.199,00:30:29.994,Give Sofi one and I'll get you a box.
00:30:36.709,00:30:38.962,"Hurry up, kids. It's 7:20."
00:30:39.045,00:30:40.797,"Nah-uh, it's 7:17."
00:30:43.633,00:30:45.760,Here. Get fatter.
00:30:46.135,00:30:47.762,-Turn that off! -No!
00:30:48.012,00:30:50.014,"-Turn it off! -Okay, I'll turn it off."
00:30:53.101,00:30:55.478,-Get out of my way! -You get out of my way!
00:30:55.562,00:30:56.896,Shotgun!
00:31:01.901,00:31:05.154,-Put on Radio Exitos! -I'm up front. I choose.
00:32:04.213,00:32:06.215,Or when you get old?
00:32:06.299,00:32:08.051,"No, when I was old."
00:32:09.385,00:32:11.804,And when was that?
00:32:12.347,00:32:14.140,Before I was born.
00:32:15.433,00:32:17.143,And what did you do then?
00:32:18.394,00:32:20.063,I was a pilot.
00:32:21.356,00:32:23.816,"-A pilot? -Yes, a fighter pilot."
00:32:24.275,00:32:25.568,Did you like it?
00:32:25.944,00:32:27.320,"No, it was scary."
00:32:28.029,00:32:32.325,Was it? I'll be right back.
00:32:43.878,00:32:46.547,-Prepare Dr. Antonio's oatmeal. -Ah.
00:32:57.392,00:32:58.518,You're almost done.
00:33:00.895,00:33:01.980,Your juice.
00:33:02.730,00:33:05.400,Pepe will wait to say goodbye to Daddy.
00:33:06.401,00:33:08.569,"-It's fine if he's late. -Yes, ma'am."
00:33:08.653,00:33:11.698,"-I'll take the bags, Doctor. -Thanks."
00:33:11.781,00:33:13.992,"-Hi, Daddy! -Your oatmeal is ready, Doctor."
00:33:15.076,00:33:16.953,Pepe waited to say goodbye.
00:33:17.662,00:33:18.663,"Morning, Pepón!"
00:33:19.163,00:33:20.790,Yuck! Cigarette!
00:33:45.565,00:33:49.527,"-Damn... -Mom, Daddy stepped on dog poo."
00:33:49.819,00:33:52.113,"-Let me help you, Cleo. -Thank you, Doctor."
00:34:00.913,00:34:02.915,"-Bye, Pepón! -Bye, Daddy."
00:34:03.666,00:34:05.460,-Take care. -You too.
00:34:06.419,00:34:08.171,"-Go with Cleo. -Yes, Mom."
00:34:22.643,00:34:24.228,We'll be here.
00:34:24.771,00:34:26.439,It's just a few weeks.
00:35:32.672,00:35:35.758,Goddammit! I told you to clean up the dog shit!
00:35:37.426,00:35:39.637,I'll take him. Come on.
00:35:39.720,00:35:41.764,"-Bye, Cleo! -Bye."
00:37:03.679,00:37:05.431,"Hey, I have to..."
00:37:22.365,00:37:23.866,It's just that... I'm late.
00:37:39.465,00:37:41.926,I think I'm pregnant.
00:37:46.806,00:37:47.765,"Ah, well..."
00:37:49.850,00:37:51.435,"That's good, right?"
00:37:52.395,00:37:53.354,Yes?
00:37:57.483,00:37:58.401,Yeah.
00:38:22.675,00:38:23.676,I need the bathroom.
00:38:25.094,00:38:26.971,But it's almost over.
00:38:27.054,00:38:29.432,"Yes, but I have to go now. I won't be long."
00:38:29.515,00:38:31.434,-Want an ice cream? -No.
00:40:39.061,00:40:42.523,No strings! No tricks!
00:40:50.906,00:40:55.703,Boom! Bones is dead!
00:42:12.196,00:42:13.447,"Thank you, Cleo."
00:42:14.448,00:42:15.824,"Thank you, Cleo."
00:42:16.408,00:42:21.539,"Mrs. Sofi? When you have a minute, can we talk?"
00:42:21.914,00:42:26.794,"Sure, but just call the kids first."
00:42:27.169,00:42:28.170,Okay.
00:42:49.608,00:42:50.651,Sofi!
00:42:54.738,00:43:00.119,"Come, sweetie. We'll come back after."
00:43:24.184,00:43:27.479,-I'm going to the stationer's. -You can go later.
00:43:27.563,00:43:28.731,"Sit down, Cleo."
00:43:28.814,00:43:30.399,I have news.
00:43:30.482,00:43:33.235,"-We're going to Disneyland! -Yeah, Disneyland!"
00:43:33.319,00:43:36.864,No. We're spending Christmas at your uncle's.
00:43:36.947,00:43:42.119,"-It's so boring there! -No it isn't, my cousins are there!"
00:43:42.202,00:43:44.788,"And for New Year's, we'll go to the Bárcenas' hacienda."
00:43:44.872,00:43:46.957,-Are the Richards going? -Yes.
00:43:47.041,00:43:50.919,"-And the Matos family, and the Larssons. -When's Dad coming?"
00:43:51.211,00:43:56.634,His research is keeping him in Quebec a little longer.
00:43:56.717,00:43:58.844,-Until January? -He doesn't know.
00:43:59.386,00:44:03.766,But I brought paper so you can write him a letter. Mmm?
00:44:03.849,00:44:05.434,Write him-- Hey!
00:44:05.768,00:44:09.438,Tell him that you love him and to please come home soon.
00:44:09.521,00:44:10.856,I'm going to the store.
00:44:10.939,00:44:13.776,You're not going anywhere until you're done with your letter.
00:44:16.820,00:44:17.655,No!
00:44:19.615,00:44:21.408,Sure. Go to your room.
00:44:21.492,00:44:22.993,"Then I'm going up, too."
00:44:31.418,00:44:34.713,"Sofi, help Pepe write his letter at the table."
00:44:34.797,00:44:36.674,I need to talk with Cleo.
00:44:36.757,00:44:40.052,"Help him write, ''I miss you a lot, Dad."
00:44:40.135,00:44:43.389,"-Make lots of pretty drawings. -Let's go, Pepe."
00:44:43.847,00:44:44.807,"Let's go, Pepe."
00:44:49.103,00:44:50.646,"Wait, Sofi!"
00:44:53.524,00:44:54.733,"Come, Cleo."
00:44:59.738,00:45:00.698,What's up?
00:45:03.325,00:45:04.284,What is it?
00:45:05.869,00:45:06.870,Are you all right?
00:45:07.788,00:45:11.291,-Yes. -Sure? What's wrong?
00:45:13.127,00:45:14.294,Is your mom all right?
00:45:15.713,00:45:16.839,-Yes. -Yes?
00:45:17.798,00:45:19.508,"Oh, Mrs. Sofi..."
00:45:20.884,00:45:21.844,What's wrong?
00:45:23.095,00:45:26.098,It's just that I think I'm pregnant.
00:45:29.268,00:45:30.853,What do you mean you ''think''?
00:45:31.603,00:45:33.772,I haven't gotten my period.
00:45:35.190,00:45:36.608,Since when?
00:45:37.735,00:45:38.694,I don't know...
00:45:41.864,00:45:43.115,Who's the father?
00:45:43.490,00:45:46.493,Fermín. The cousin of Adela's boyfriend.
00:45:46.869,00:45:48.495,Does he know?
00:45:49.705,00:45:51.498,He's gone.
00:45:51.582,00:45:55.419,Silly.
00:45:57.921,00:45:59.173,Fire you?
00:45:59.256,00:46:01.925,Of course not!
00:46:02.009,00:46:07.681,We have to take you to get checked.
00:46:07.765,00:46:09.558,"Look, Mom! I drew a plane."
00:46:10.142,00:46:11.101,Let's see.
00:46:12.686,00:46:15.105,Why is Cleo crying?
00:46:15.689,00:46:17.483,She has a tummy ache.
00:46:19.985,00:46:26.283,"Pain, pain, go away, I don't want this pain to stay."
00:46:26.366,00:46:29.870,"Sofi! I told you to help Pepe write, I miss you a lot, Dad."
00:48:11.346,00:48:12.931,"-Hello. -Hi, how can I help you?"
00:48:13.015,00:48:14.683,We have an appointment with Doctor Vélez.
00:48:14.766,00:48:18.020,-Under what name? -Cleodegaria Gutiérrez.
00:48:20.105,00:48:21.148,Here she comes.
00:48:21.565,00:48:25.193,-Sofía! -Margarita! How are you?
00:48:25.277,00:48:27.905,Thank you for seeing us. Remember Cleo?
00:48:27.988,00:48:30.991,"-Hi, Cleo. How are you? -Fine, thank you, Doctor."
00:48:31.074,00:48:34.995,"I'm going to check her, and we'll see you later."
00:48:35.078,00:48:36.997,Okay. I'll go say hi to Dr. Zavala.
00:48:37.080,00:48:39.708,It'll take about 40 minutes.
00:48:39.791,00:48:42.961,"Cleo, come with me."
00:48:48.467,00:48:49.635,About when?
00:48:54.640,00:48:58.060,Are you sexually active?
00:49:01.104,00:49:02.189,You are.
00:49:05.317,00:49:07.361,When did you start?
00:49:10.697,00:49:11.990,Has it been long?
00:49:15.911,00:49:16.995,Not long.
00:49:17.412,00:49:19.039,One or two years?
00:49:19.581,00:49:20.666,Less?
00:49:22.167,00:49:23.293,Less.
00:49:28.006,00:49:30.258,How many sexual partners have you had?
00:49:33.971,00:49:35.097,Just one?
00:49:36.556,00:49:37.516,Very well.
00:49:38.809,00:49:41.311,Don't worry. This is common.
00:49:41.395,00:49:46.400,We'll examine you from the waist down.
00:49:46.483,00:49:51.154,She'll get you in position.
00:49:51.238,00:49:53.407,"Lie down, carefully."
00:50:00.372,00:50:02.582,Put one leg here.
00:50:04.418,00:50:05.711,And the other here.
00:50:12.342,00:50:15.220,I'll see you in a month. Any questions?
00:50:17.597,00:50:21.268,There she is. I'll go with you.
00:50:21.351,00:50:25.605,He hasn't even called the kids.
00:50:25.689,00:50:27.649,-Mario! -Doctor.
00:50:31.111,00:50:32.112,How's Cleo?
00:50:32.738,00:50:33.822,Cleo is fine.
00:50:33.905,00:50:38.368,She's three to four months pregnant.
00:50:38.452,00:50:41.788,"With some rest, she'll be fine."
00:50:41.872,00:50:43.040,When's she due?
00:50:43.123,00:50:46.710,Around the end of June.
00:50:47.127,00:50:51.381,-Thanks for seeing her. -It's nothing!
00:50:51.465,00:50:53.175,-Take care. -You too.
00:50:53.258,00:50:54.176,-Mario. -Doctor.
00:50:54.259,00:50:56.303,-Take care. -Thanks.
00:50:56.762,00:51:00.891,"Cleo, why don't you go to see the newborns while I finish up with Dr. Zavala?"
00:51:04.102,00:51:05.604,You have to talk to Antonio.
00:51:21.244,00:51:27.334,"I'll do her hair, and bathe her..."
00:51:27.417,00:51:33.840,Soon we'll take her home so you can play with her.
00:51:35.592,00:51:36.760,Earthquake!
00:51:38.095,00:51:39.721,Kneel.
00:51:39.805,00:51:42.140,Get the babies out!
00:51:45.477,00:51:47.479,"Our Father, Who art in Heaven..."
00:51:50.357,00:51:51.983,"Hurry, the babies!"
00:53:13.356,00:53:14.858,Stinky.
00:53:16.651,00:53:17.819,"Shut up, idiot."
00:53:33.251,00:53:36.379,"-Comadre, welcome! -Hi, honey."
00:53:37.422,00:53:38.840,That belly of yours?
00:53:39.549,00:53:41.176,I'll tell you later.
00:53:42.135,00:53:43.678,"Yes, you will."
00:53:43.762,00:53:48.308,"Sure, but give me a hand."
00:53:50.936,00:53:52.896,You sure you can carry it all?
00:53:52.979,00:53:56.441,"I'm pregnant, not sick. Why, are you tired?"
00:53:56.524,00:54:00.195,-As if! -You've gotten so old since last year.
00:54:00.278,00:54:03.615,"Mountains are old, but they're still green."
00:54:03.698,00:54:05.200,Here!
00:54:05.617,00:54:07.619,You're pregnant and forgetful?
00:54:09.621,00:54:10.830,That's one bed.
00:54:10.914,00:54:12.832,This goes here.
00:54:13.416,00:54:15.919,And there's the other one.
00:54:16.002,00:54:18.546,This one's for Paco.
00:54:23.218,00:54:24.636,They were in storage.
00:54:25.178,00:54:27.806,They're all the dogs that lived here.
00:54:28.890,00:54:31.643,Look. That there was Pirata.
00:54:32.644,00:54:34.896,He died in 1911.
00:54:37.691,00:54:39.401,Do you remember Canela?
00:54:40.735,00:54:44.114,Look at her. She died last summer.
00:54:44.447,00:54:46.950,They say she ate a poisoned rat.
00:54:47.450,00:54:51.788,But I'm sure it was the villagers angry with Don José over the land.
00:54:54.165,00:54:55.709,Come on.
00:56:00.899,00:56:03.151,"What do you think of these city folks, Celso?"
00:56:03.234,00:56:06.821,"-Should we send for more bullets? -There's plenty, Doctor José."
00:56:11.618,00:56:15.038,"Paco, I'm telling you. Stay there!"
00:56:17.665,00:56:20.877,"No, no, no, no. Not that. Leslie is our representative."
00:56:20.960,00:56:22.462,"Doesn't count, she's a gringa."
00:56:22.879,00:56:24.047,"Okay, I'll go."
00:56:28.468,00:56:31.304,"Now darling, this is a loaded weapon. You have to be very careful with it."
00:56:31.388,00:56:32.597,Point the gun down.
00:56:32.680,00:56:34.849,Point the gun down when you're not using it.
00:56:36.017,00:56:39.312,"Come on, Lola! You're really going to wear a mini skirt and platform shoes?"
00:56:39.396,00:56:40.855,"Honey, we're in the woods!"
00:56:40.939,00:56:43.191,"-You look great, Lola. -That's fine."
00:56:43.733,00:56:47.904,"Okay, honey, just put your feet in the T position, pull the trigger way back, and shoot."
00:56:49.614,00:56:50.824,"Okay, one more time."
00:56:51.783,00:56:53.410,-Oh! -Yes!
00:56:53.493,00:56:56.413,"Watch out, Pepe! Your wife is going to join the guerrillas!"
00:56:56.496,00:56:57.872,Come away. You might get hurt.
00:56:57.956,00:57:00.834,"-She's gonna expropriate your hacienda! -Nah, I'll whack her first."
00:57:02.043,00:57:03.670,"Okay, come on. Do one more."
00:58:46.689,00:58:48.107,-Come with me. -Where?
00:58:48.191,00:58:50.276,-Just come. -What about him?
00:58:50.360,00:58:52.529,Is the boogeyman coming?
00:59:00.245,00:59:01.829,Don't ask.
00:59:02.330,00:59:06.251,The city's made you distrustful.
00:59:06.334,00:59:07.877,"No, Benita."
00:59:07.961,00:59:10.213,Look at the dogs.
00:59:11.422,00:59:12.632,They're tired.
00:59:12.715,00:59:16.344,The kids won't leave them alone.
00:59:21.015,00:59:24.310,"Be careful, don't roll down with that belly of yours."
00:59:49.168,00:59:51.921,They feel fancier than their bosses. Come.
01:00:01.222,01:00:02.390,Sit here.
01:00:05.727,01:00:06.936,What are you drinking?
01:00:07.020,01:00:08.354,"Nothing, thank you."
01:00:08.438,01:00:11.858,You're not going to toast the New Year with us?
01:00:11.941,01:00:13.818,It's not good for the baby.
01:00:14.277,01:00:15.862,A little won't hurt.
01:00:15.945,01:00:17.530,Celebrate while you can!
01:00:18.865,01:00:21.159,See that man over there?
01:00:21.242,01:00:25.622,They killed his son in August over the land dispute.
01:00:25.997,01:00:28.958,"-You're carrying life, right? -Yes."
01:00:29.667,01:00:31.419,So then? Mezcal?
01:00:31.502,01:00:33.671,"No, just a little pulque."
01:00:33.755,01:00:35.131,That's the spirit!
01:00:40.219,01:00:41.137,Here.
01:00:42.722,01:00:48.561,To a beautiful 1971 and your baby's health!
01:00:51.272,01:00:54.192,"-Sorry, manita... -Go dance, Gloria!"
01:00:54.275,01:00:56.319,Don't worry. Don't worry.
01:00:58.154,01:00:59.989,I'll pour you some more.
01:01:00.448,01:01:03.701,Here it is. Clean yourself up.
01:01:04.077,01:01:05.370,Salud! Salud!
01:01:05.453,01:01:06.663,Cheer up!
01:01:34.607,01:01:35.817,What's wrong with you?
01:01:35.900,01:01:37.819,I know you need it.
01:01:37.902,01:01:39.570,"Billy, no!"
01:01:39.654,01:01:42.323,I just wanted to comfort you.
01:01:42.407,01:01:43.533,You're drunk.
01:01:45.159,01:01:47.286,"You're not even that hot, comadre."
01:03:03.738,01:03:06.324,Fire! Fire! Fire!
01:03:06.407,01:03:08.701,Fire! The woods are burning!
01:03:08.785,01:03:14.499,Everybody come! Quick! Fire in the woods!
01:03:14.582,01:03:19.754,"Come on! Move! This way, everyone!"
01:03:28.888,01:03:33.059,Careful! Cover that side!
01:03:35.436,01:03:38.981,-Come here. Now! -We need water!
01:03:40.191,01:03:45.321,Make a chain!
01:03:45.404,01:03:50.952,We need water! Pass the buckets!
01:03:51.035,01:03:54.121,Kids! Stay back!
01:03:55.706,01:03:59.377,Kids! Don't step on the flames!
01:04:08.594,01:04:10.847,Just the little fires.
01:04:13.182,01:04:18.521,"That's it, Andy! Gerardo, Cleo will help you."
01:04:23.901,01:04:25.903,-Not too close to the fire! -Nine...
01:04:25.987,01:04:28.739,"Eight, seven..."
01:04:29.657,01:04:32.577,"six, five..."
01:04:33.411,01:04:38.416,"four, three, two, one."
01:04:38.499,01:04:40.167,Happy New Year!
01:06:40.538,01:06:41.956,"Go, go, go, go, go, Toño!"
01:06:42.039,01:06:43.165,"Hey, Toño!"
01:07:05.771,01:07:08.315,"If we peek under, we can see its panties."
01:07:36.635,01:07:38.512,This feels like my village.
01:07:39.513,01:07:42.683,It's drier there. But it feels like it...
01:07:46.228,01:07:48.314,The animals do that too.
01:07:53.527,01:07:55.071,It sounds like this.
01:08:00.493,01:08:02.078,And smells the same.
01:08:32.441,01:08:33.651,It looks like new!
01:08:40.658,01:08:42.701,The Cowboys won because Baltimore got cocky.
01:08:42.785,01:08:45.412,We won anyway!
01:08:45.496,01:08:48.165,Baltimore got cocky. Who likes the Cowboys?
01:08:51.877,01:08:53.671,"-Hello, Beto. -Afternoon, señora."
01:08:53.754,01:08:55.840,-Can we go to the movies? -To see what?
01:09:03.931,01:09:06.016,-Everyone can go! -Not fair!
01:09:06.100,01:09:08.394,-I'm going. -You're not.
01:09:08.477,01:09:11.105,-Everyone goes! -That's not fair!
01:09:11.188,01:09:13.190,"If you don't like it, go live elsewhere!"
01:09:14.400,01:09:16.443,Mrs. Molly is on the phone.
01:09:17.027,01:09:18.696,-I'll get it upstairs. -I'll take them.
01:09:18.779,01:09:20.656,No! You won't like it.
01:09:37.214,01:09:39.300,"Borras, Borras."
01:09:41.302,01:09:42.303,Borras.
01:09:52.980,01:09:54.273,We're late!
01:09:55.191,01:09:56.525,Are you coming?
01:09:56.609,01:09:59.236,"-Grandma, we need to go. -Toño, let's go."
01:10:00.112,01:10:01.530,We're leaving!
01:10:02.156,01:10:04.909,-Wait! I'm coming. -Let's go.
01:10:17.213,01:10:18.464,"Borras, Borras!"
01:10:21.675,01:10:25.679,-Catch him! -Hurry up!
01:10:25.763,01:10:28.015,"Come on, we're late!"
01:10:39.735,01:10:40.986,"Toño, Beto!"
01:10:41.779,01:10:42.947,Don't run!
01:10:44.740,01:10:45.741,Kids!
01:10:46.700,01:10:47.785,Toño!
01:11:01.632,01:11:02.967,-Toño! -Run!
01:11:03.050,01:11:05.302,-Cleo! Toño! -I'll see you at the movies!
01:11:10.349,01:11:11.475,Toño!
01:11:15.062,01:11:16.063,Toño!
01:12:30.429,01:12:34.391,-Check her out! -Look at her!
01:12:36.393,01:12:37.353,Antonio.
01:12:38.270,01:12:40.439,"Hey, watch out!"
01:12:52.451,01:12:53.660,Put the magazine away!
01:12:55.329,01:12:56.330,Let's go.
01:13:00.084,01:13:01.877,Your grandma is worried.
01:13:06.715,01:13:08.634,"Come on, let's get the tickets."
01:14:30.382,01:14:40.017,"...to improve the infrastructure, I've come here today to respond to your demand for water."
01:14:41.268,01:14:56.575,This can only happen by uniting the will of the people with the leadership of our illustrious President Luis Echeverría Álvarez.
01:14:57.618,01:15:00.496,"Excuse me, do you know where this address is?"
01:15:01.371,01:15:03.207,-That way. -Thank you.
01:16:11.149,01:16:12.359,Ramón!
01:16:17.656,01:16:18.699,Ramón!
01:16:23.203,01:16:24.121,Ramón!
01:16:30.002,01:16:31.878,"-What's up, Cleo? -Hi."
01:16:32.212,01:16:34.965,I just came to give Fermín his jacket.
01:16:35.048,01:16:36.258,I'll give it to him.
01:16:36.592,01:16:38.385,But I need to talk to him.
01:16:38.927,01:16:40.012,He's not here.
01:16:40.846,01:16:42.014,It's important.
01:16:42.431,01:16:44.057,But we're rehearsing.
01:16:45.517,01:16:47.769,Adela said you would help.
01:16:49.980,01:16:50.897,One sec.
01:16:53.692,01:16:54.693,Hold on to this.
01:16:56.695,01:16:57.946,Can you give me a ride?
01:16:59.364,01:17:00.365,Let's go.
01:17:00.449,01:17:02.159,"Hold on, let me put on some pants."
01:17:21.511,01:17:23.138,Here is where he trains.
01:17:24.806,01:17:25.974,"Thank you, Ramón."
01:17:28.143,01:17:30.562,Don't tell him I brought you.
01:17:30.646,01:17:32.522,No. Thank you.
01:19:03.655,01:19:06.199,Right flank!
01:19:28.513,01:19:30.474,The Professor Zovek?
01:19:30.557,01:19:31.558,Yes!
01:19:32.058,01:19:33.560,Does he always come here?
01:19:33.643,01:19:36.313,No. But sometimes he trains them.
01:19:52.579,01:19:53.622,Welcome!
01:19:55.373,01:19:59.294,May the energy dwell in you.
01:20:02.422,01:20:03.340,You.
01:20:04.007,01:20:05.008,You.
01:20:05.091,01:20:06.176,And you as well!
01:20:07.135,01:20:08.637,You can become a warrior!
01:20:09.346,01:20:11.723,Every human has a great potential...
01:20:12.474,01:20:15.393,that can be developed through physical training.
01:20:15.477,01:20:16.394,Yes!
01:20:16.728,01:20:22.442,"But most importantly, through the evolution of the mind..."
01:20:23.443,01:20:24.694,and the spirit.
01:20:25.862,01:20:28.198,You can develop this potential.
01:20:28.657,01:20:30.242,But don't expect a miracle!
01:20:30.659,01:20:36.373,The only miracle resides within your own will.
01:20:37.082,01:20:39.918,"Remember, the mind..."
01:20:41.002,01:20:42.295,is the motor...
01:20:43.630,01:20:45.340,for the physical.
01:20:49.386,01:20:50.554,And up next...
01:20:55.183,01:20:56.226,an act.
01:21:00.397,01:21:05.026,This act requires total physical and mental focus.
01:21:07.779,01:21:14.619,"Only the Lamas, martial arts masters, and a few great athletes..."
01:21:15.537,01:21:18.290,have been able to master it.
01:21:22.002,01:21:22.919,You.
01:21:23.628,01:21:24.963,"Yes, you. Come here."
01:21:28.967,01:21:30.552,Please cover my eyes.
01:21:33.680,01:21:38.518,Make sure they are properly covered.
01:21:41.313,01:21:43.398,Thank you. You may return to your place.
01:22:27.943,01:22:31.821,What did you expect? For me to levitate or lift a jet?
01:22:32.989,01:22:34.950,You are witnessing an incredible feat!
01:22:35.575,01:22:38.995,"If you don't believe me, then try it."
01:22:39.913,01:22:42.123,But with your eyes closed.
01:23:44.686,01:23:46.396,"-How are you, Fermín? -Good."
01:23:46.479,01:23:48.982,-How did you feel about the training? -It's tough.
01:23:49.482,01:23:50.942,What about the new trainers?
01:23:51.568,01:23:53.111,The Korean coach is good.
01:23:53.611,01:23:55.405,"Yes, but tough."
01:24:06.458,01:24:08.001,Do you have a minute?
01:24:16.301,01:24:17.260,"Hi, Cleo."
01:24:17.635,01:24:18.636,"Hi, Fermín."
01:24:19.429,01:24:20.722,What brings you around?
01:24:21.639,01:24:25.685,"I've left you messages, but I couldn't find you."
01:24:27.479,01:24:29.689,"I'm sorry, training has been intense."
01:24:30.648,01:24:32.942,They even brought a gringo coach and a Korean.
01:24:33.777,01:24:36.321,"Well, the American was already here, but the Korean is new."
01:24:37.197,01:24:38.990,Is it for the Olympics?
01:24:39.657,01:24:40.700,Something like that.
01:24:41.534,01:24:42.869,Who told you I was here?
01:24:44.829,01:24:51.544,A neighbor's brother-in-law trains here with you.
01:24:52.045,01:24:53.004,It was Ramón.
01:24:53.088,01:24:54.005,No.
01:24:55.006,01:25:01.846,I'm gonna kick that fat fucker's ass.
01:25:03.598,01:25:05.183,It's just that I'm pregnant.
01:25:06.434,01:25:07.352,What's it to me?
01:25:08.061,01:25:11.022,"-It's just that, the little one's yours. -No fucking way."
01:25:11.106,01:25:12.482,I swear it is.
01:25:15.652,01:25:21.282,"And if you don't want me to beat the shit out of you and your little one, don't ever say it again, and don't ever come looking for me again."
01:25:27.580,01:25:28.748,Fucking servant!
01:25:33.586,01:25:35.380,"Hurry up, Fermín!"
01:26:08.329,01:26:11.332,He says he's short on money and doesn't have any to send.
01:26:11.416,01:26:14.919,But now he likes diving and is buying all the gear.
01:26:15.003,01:26:17.589,You know how much that costs?
01:26:22.719,01:26:25.680,He sends letters to the kids pretending he's in Quebec.
01:26:29.100,01:26:32.145,Such bullshit he invents.
01:26:37.108,01:26:41.613,That he misses them but his research is delayed.
01:26:46.784,01:26:51.456,"-Paco, come here. -Okay, don't worry, I'll call you later."
01:26:52.749,01:26:54.125,Are you spying on me?
01:27:07.805,01:27:10.516,Why are you still there? Don't you have anything to do?
01:27:11.226,01:27:12.268,Get out!
01:27:13.645,01:27:17.649,Please don't tell your siblings.
01:27:30.245,01:27:32.413,"Ah! He's passing you, Paco!"
01:27:43.049,01:27:44.968,"-Move, Pepe. -No."
01:27:45.051,01:27:46.052,Move!
01:27:46.636,01:27:47.595,No.
01:27:47.887,01:27:49.889,-I said move! -No!
01:27:52.267,01:27:53.893,"-That's mine, Paco! -No, it's mine."
01:28:35.893,01:28:38.438,-They're fighting. -I'm coming.
01:28:45.570,01:28:48.364,"Paco, Toño, stop! You're going to get hurt!"
01:28:48.656,01:28:50.033,You're not animals!
01:28:50.325,01:28:51.284,Toño!
01:28:52.410,01:28:55.580,Toño! Let him go!
01:28:57.749,01:29:00.001,"Paco, drop that!"
01:29:00.084,01:29:02.170,What are you doing? Drop that!
01:29:04.047,01:29:06.090,Don't be an idiot!
01:29:06.424,01:29:11.637,Are you stupid? You could've killed him!
01:29:13.348,01:29:14.891,It's very dangerous.
01:31:17.513,01:31:23.394,"No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone."
01:32:10.316,01:32:13.778,We'll have to park here. The students are protesting.
01:32:13.861,01:32:17.406,"Oh, God. I hope they don't beat them again."
01:32:17.490,01:32:18.699,Look. Someone's leaving.
01:32:36.551,01:32:37.510,Go ahead.
01:33:44.994,01:33:48.581,My maid needs a crib. Can you show them to us?
01:34:06.265,01:34:07.475,How about this one?
01:34:08.184,01:34:10.227,"Do you like it, Cleo?"
01:34:10.770,01:34:11.896,It's very pretty.
01:34:12.480,01:34:13.981,How much is it?
01:34:15.608,01:34:18.152,"No, but with a long-standing client discount."
01:34:18.235,01:34:20.529,Let me ask the manager.
01:34:21.530,01:34:24.617,We bought the furniture for the boys' room here.
01:35:13.124,01:35:15.751,Where is he?
01:35:17.503,01:35:20.131,Get in! Leave him alone!
01:35:20.214,01:35:21.716,Move!
01:35:21.799,01:35:23.592,-Shut up! -Come here!
01:35:26.303,01:35:28.681,I said shut up!
01:35:29.765,01:35:32.184,Fermín! Let's go!
01:35:37.773,01:35:39.442,"Fermín, let's go! Now!"
01:35:40.985,01:35:41.861,Fermín!
01:35:49.618,01:35:52.371,Help! Help!
01:35:59.044,01:36:00.254,Ignacio!
01:36:01.756,01:36:03.132,Ignacio!
01:36:23.444,01:36:24.695,Help me!
01:36:25.070,01:36:26.947,Help me! Help me!
01:36:28.824,01:36:31.202,"Jorge, please, let's go!"
01:36:34.371,01:36:35.456,Why?
01:36:37.666,01:36:38.834,Help!
01:36:39.335,01:36:40.669,Help me!
01:36:41.128,01:36:43.339,Help me! Help me!
01:38:21.103,01:38:23.314,Dr. Vélez!
01:38:26.567,01:38:28.986,-You have an appointment? -Her water broke.
01:38:29.069,01:38:34.116,-Find Dr. Vélez. -Here she comes.
01:38:34.992,01:38:36.619,"Doctor, your patient is here."
01:38:37.161,01:38:40.706,"Orderly, please. Sofía just called me."
01:38:41.457,01:38:45.169,"Hello, ma'am. Cleo, you're having contractions."
01:38:45.252,01:38:49.548,Let's get her to delivery. You'll have to fill out some forms.
01:38:50.090,01:38:52.635,"Paty, take their information. We're going to delivery."
01:38:52.718,01:38:56.347,"Yes, Doctor. Please come this way."
01:38:56.931,01:39:00.976,-What's her full name? -Cleodegaria Gutiérrez.
01:39:01.060,01:39:02.645,Her middle name?
01:39:03.103,01:39:04.271,I don't know.
01:39:07.524,01:39:09.443,Her date of birth?
01:39:10.402,01:39:13.030,What's your relationship with the patient?
01:39:13.113,01:39:14.114,I'm her employer.
01:39:14.198,01:39:17.785,-Is there any family member here? -No. No.
01:39:17.868,01:39:19.703,That's fine.
01:39:20.037,01:39:23.248,One last question. Is your patient insured?
01:39:31.173,01:39:32.091,Good evening.
01:39:34.885,01:39:37.304,Careful. Let's go.
01:39:41.266,01:39:42.393,"One moment, please."
01:39:43.560,01:39:44.520,Excuse me.
01:39:44.895,01:39:46.188,-Doctor. -Doctor.
01:39:46.897,01:39:48.607,"Hello, Cleo. How are you feeling?"
01:39:49.316,01:39:51.235,Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
01:39:51.318,01:39:54.113,"Right, Dr. Vélez? How many babies have you delivered?"
01:39:54.238,01:39:55.656,"Hundreds, Doctor."
01:39:57.366,01:39:59.243,Give me your hand. Give me your hand.
01:39:59.827,01:40:00.869,And breathe.
01:40:02.955,01:40:04.665,"-We must hurry. -Yes, Doctor."
01:40:04.748,01:40:05.791,Breathe.
01:40:05.874,01:40:06.834,Breathe.
01:40:11.171,01:40:12.840,Excuse me. Over here.
01:40:14.341,01:40:16.343,This way.
01:40:16.635,01:40:19.805,"Dr. Vélez won't let me go in. You'll do great, Cleo."
01:40:19.888,01:40:22.016,Feel free to come if you like.
01:40:22.474,01:40:24.101,I can't. I have an appointment.
01:40:24.184,01:40:25.978,"Come on, let's go."
01:40:28.022,01:40:33.068,I'm taking a patient to delivery. Ask admissions for her file.
01:40:36.113,01:40:38.323,Please assist me.
01:40:38.407,01:40:42.536,Pass me the partogram. Let's examine her.
01:40:42.619,01:40:43.495,"Yes, Doctor."
01:40:43.579,01:40:47.750,She is in labor. Her water broke.
01:40:48.125,01:40:50.836,"Cleo, when was your last period?"
01:40:52.171,01:40:54.048,-September. -September.
01:40:54.506,01:40:57.760,I'm removing your underwear and shoes.
01:40:57.843,01:40:59.595,We're moving you into position.
01:40:59.887,01:41:04.808,-I'm going to listen to your baby. -When did your water break?
01:41:06.185,01:41:10.230,-Around two hours ago? -We couldn't get here quicker.
01:41:10.314,01:41:13.984,-Don't worry. Breathe. -I'm uncovering your belly.
01:41:14.568,01:41:17.988,"-Easy, Cleo. Breathe deep. -Breathe."
01:41:18.072,01:41:20.866,How is the heart rate?
01:41:20.949,01:41:23.035,"-I can't hear anything, Doctor. -Okay."
01:41:23.494,01:41:26.246,"-A glove, please. -Glove, Doctor."
01:41:26.330,01:41:30.417,I need you to breathe deeply.
01:41:30.501,01:41:33.337,I'm going to examine you. It'll bother a bit.
01:41:34.379,01:41:37.508,"-Relax. Easy, please. -Breathe."
01:41:37.591,01:41:41.303,-How is it? -Complete. Direct. Third plane.
01:41:41.720,01:41:46.058,"-Meconium fluid, Doctor. -We need to canalize."
01:41:46.141,01:41:49.728,-Moving patient to surgery. -Let me listen to your baby.
01:41:49.812,01:41:52.106,Easy.
01:41:52.898,01:41:55.442,"-I'm not hearing anything, Doctor. -Let's move."
01:41:55.776,01:41:57.111,Get the stretcher.
01:41:58.737,01:42:02.282,"Cleo, breathe deeply. We're taking you to surgery. Okay. One..."
01:42:04.743,01:42:07.204,-Let's go! -Easy.
01:42:07.871,01:42:09.706,"Patient coming through, please."
01:42:11.416,01:42:12.793,Call Pediatrics!
01:42:45.909,01:42:48.704,-Call Pediatrics. -No scrubs. It's an emergency.

01:43:05.137,01:43:07.014,"Scoot down, please."
01:43:24.198,01:43:28.619,Where is the pediatrician?
01:43:34.249,01:43:36.043,The head is out.
01:43:36.126,01:43:37.502,Easy. Good.
01:43:37.586,01:43:38.670,"Edwin, please."
01:43:40.130,01:43:41.173,Cut the cord.

01:44:13.330,01:44:14.289,Listening.
01:44:17.459,01:44:19.795,"Ma'am, I can't hear a heartbeat."
01:44:23.715,01:44:25.092,"-One, two, three. -Ventilating."
01:44:25.175,01:44:26.468,"-One, two, three. -Ventilating."
01:44:26.551,01:44:27.928,"-One, two, three. -Ventilating."
01:44:28.011,01:44:29.012,Listening.
01:44:30.264,01:44:31.556,There's no response.
01:44:32.975,01:44:34.142,"Another cycle, Doctor?"
01:44:34.226,01:44:35.310,Let's continue.
01:44:35.394,01:44:36.812,"-One, two, three. -Ventilating."
01:44:36.895,01:44:38.188,"-One, two, three. -Ventilating."
01:44:38.272,01:44:40.607,"-One, two, three. -Ventilating."
01:44:40.691,01:44:42.359,"-Here it is, Doctor. -Listening."
01:44:45.028,01:44:46.113,No response.
01:44:47.447,01:44:48.991,We're suspending CPR.
01:45:02.796,01:45:03.714,Cutting...
01:45:12.556,01:45:15.851,"We did all we could, but there was no response."
01:45:16.727,01:45:18.103,Would you like to hold it?
01:45:19.104,01:45:19.980,Yes.
01:45:24.276,01:45:26.778,Here is your baby. It's a girl.
01:45:35.203,01:45:36.496,Say goodbye to her.
01:45:40.876,01:45:44.087,"I need to take her now, Cleo. Say goodbye to her."
01:45:51.261,01:45:53.638,"Let me have her, please. I need to prepare her."
01:46:02.189,01:46:03.190,Allow me...
01:46:06.193,01:46:08.320,"-Prepare her, please. -Yes, Doctor."
01:46:08.820,01:46:10.113,"Gutiérrez, Cleodegaria."
01:46:24.586,01:46:28.382,We gave you a few stitches.
01:46:29.591,01:46:31.009,"We're very sorry, Cleo."
01:49:23.265,01:49:24.224,Borras.
01:49:25.433,01:49:26.643,"Come, Borras."
01:50:02.053,01:50:05.807,-Toño! Sofi! Come! -Mom bought a new car!
01:50:06.308,01:50:07.350,You like it?
01:50:07.851,01:50:09.019,How fast does it go?
01:50:09.978,01:50:11.479,Why not a Maverick?
01:50:11.563,01:50:14.399,Too expensive. I wanted a smaller car.
01:50:14.858,01:50:17.068,I've had it with that Galaxy.
01:50:17.611,01:50:19.487,"I like it, Mommy."
01:50:21.197,01:50:23.074,-What about the Galaxy? -I sold it.
01:50:23.158,01:50:25.368,-It goes next week. -Does Dad know?
01:50:25.452,01:50:27.037,"No, it's a surprise."
01:50:27.996,01:50:30.915,"-Do you like the new car, Cleo? -Yes."
01:50:31.708,01:50:36.671,"And speaking of surprises, we're taking the Galaxy for a goodbye trip."
01:50:36.755,01:50:38.256,-Where to? -Tuxpan.
01:50:38.340,01:50:39.382,Where's that?
01:50:39.466,01:50:41.301,-I've got a match. -Skip it.
01:50:41.384,01:50:42.761,Tuxpan is near Veracruz.
01:50:42.844,01:50:44.220,-Is there a beach? -Yes.
01:50:44.304,01:50:46.181,The beaches in Veracruz are ugly.
01:50:46.640,01:50:49.017,"And we're going to invite Cleo along, right?"
01:50:49.100,01:50:50.518,Yes!
01:50:52.562,01:50:54.189,Come on. It'll do you good.
01:50:54.272,01:50:55.982,"-Right, Adela? -Yes, ma'am."
01:50:56.066,01:50:58.193,"Besides, the kids will miss you if you don't come."
01:50:58.276,01:50:59.110,Yes!
01:50:59.194,01:51:01.529,"But she'll be on vacation, you can't make her work."
01:51:01.613,01:51:02.614,Yes.
01:51:02.697,01:51:03.865,Are you coming?
01:51:07.494,01:51:08.703,"So, you're coming?"
01:51:09.663,01:51:10.664,Yes!
01:51:10.997,01:51:12.999,Perfect! Would you help me pack?
01:51:13.083,01:51:14.626,"-Yes, ma'am. -Let's go pack."
01:51:18.046,01:51:20.632,"-I'm gonna help her pack. -Pepe, bring the guns."
01:51:58.086,01:51:59.796,La Pantera doesn't reach this far.
01:52:19.607,01:52:22.360,Beach! Beach!
01:52:22.444,01:52:24.821,Beach! Beach!
01:52:27.365,01:52:28.658,Yeah!
01:52:45.759,01:52:46.718,Come on!
01:53:05.111,01:53:06.154,Come.
01:53:06.237,01:53:07.822,"No, I don't know how to swim."
01:53:07.906,01:53:09.115,Come on.
01:53:09.616,01:53:11.534,You go. I'll watch you from here.
01:53:32.180,01:53:34.307,-Which way? -Follow me.
01:53:36.434,01:53:39.562,"-Can we go back again? -Yes, of course."
01:53:39.646,01:53:42.190,-But now a hot bath. -Yes.
01:54:14.097,01:54:17.433,Ow! It burns!
01:54:20.270,01:54:22.522,Did you like the waves?
01:54:24.023,01:54:26.025,I did.
01:54:27.443,01:54:30.989,Do you know how to dive under them?
01:54:33.366,01:54:35.451,Have you gone mute?
01:54:36.369,01:54:37.620,No. Let's go.
01:54:48.131,01:54:49.841,Dressed already?
01:54:50.049,01:54:52.886,"Yes, but Cleo's gone mute."
01:54:53.219,01:54:55.346,"-Thank you, Cleo. -You're welcome, ma'am."
01:55:24.959,01:55:25.835,Children!
01:55:26.669,01:55:28.755,Kids! Listen!
01:55:29.464,01:55:30.924,I have something to tell you.
01:55:34.260,01:55:35.678,Your dad isn't in Ottawa.
01:55:36.596,01:55:37.889,Is he back?
01:55:37.972,01:55:38.848,No.
01:55:39.432,01:55:40.892,Your dad never went away.
01:55:42.393,01:55:44.103,"Well, he did, but only for a week."
01:55:46.773,01:55:48.441,Your dad isn't coming back home.
01:55:52.612,01:55:54.864,We came here so he can take his things.
01:55:56.908,01:56:00.161,What he says are his things.
01:56:01.454,01:56:04.624,"His clothes, his books, his bookcases..."
01:56:05.959,01:56:07.502,Are you getting a divorce?
01:56:10.171,01:56:11.339,He doesn't know.
01:56:14.092,01:56:16.970,"Of course he loves you, a lot."
01:56:21.766,01:56:23.101,He doesn't know.
01:56:24.811,01:56:25.770,But soon.
01:56:28.606,01:56:32.443,There's going to be changes. But we're together!
01:56:32.527,01:56:34.320,And it's going to be an adventure!
01:56:34.404,01:56:37.490,I'm starting a full-time job at a publishing house.
01:56:40.618,01:56:42.870,"I know, but your dad hasn't sent us any money."
01:56:43.287,01:56:44.872,And teaching isn't enough.
01:56:45.790,01:56:49.127,And I love books! And I never really liked chemistry.
01:56:51.212,01:56:52.630,It'll be another adventure.
01:56:54.132,01:56:56.634,"And we must stay together, really close."
01:56:57.844,01:56:58.803,"Right, Cleo?"
01:56:59.303,01:57:00.221,Yes.
01:57:00.304,01:57:02.098,"Very, very close."
01:57:02.181,01:57:03.057,Hmm?
01:57:04.308,01:57:05.226,Darling?
01:57:08.730,01:57:09.856,Very close.
01:57:10.440,01:57:11.566,Are you finished?
01:57:12.358,01:57:14.402,"For dessert, we have ice cream."
01:57:15.153,01:57:20.366,"Coconut, strawberry, vanilla, banana, and flan."
01:58:44.367,01:58:46.786,We're leaving early tomorrow. Want to come?
01:58:46.869,01:58:49.455,"-No, it's our last day. -I want to stay too."
01:58:49.539,01:58:52.875,"Okay, but no swimming. Cleo can't swim."
01:58:52.959,01:58:56.420,"-But it's really calm. -If you want to stay, that's the rule."
01:58:56.838,01:58:59.882,-Near the shore? -Okay. But only near the shore.
01:58:59.966,01:59:02.135,"-Yes! -Can I swim too, Mom?"
01:59:02.218,01:59:04.637,"-Yes, but only near the shore. -Yeah!"
01:59:18.442,01:59:20.153,"Come, I'll clean you up."
01:59:22.029,01:59:24.031,Paco! You heard your mom.
01:59:24.365,01:59:25.992,"Otherwise, you're getting out."
01:59:32.832,01:59:35.251,Sofi! Paco! Closer to the shore!
01:59:50.141,01:59:51.309,Paco!
01:59:52.101,01:59:55.938,"When I was older, I used to be a sailor."
01:59:57.148,02:00:00.985,But I drowned in a storm.
02:00:02.612,02:00:05.990,The waves were huge!
02:00:07.283,02:00:09.952,Sofi! Paco! Near the shore!
02:00:13.372,02:00:17.293,"and there was lightning, and I didn't know how to swim."
02:00:17.376,02:00:18.628,Wait here.
02:00:22.423,02:00:24.508,Paco! Come closer!
02:00:29.639,02:00:30.890,Sofi!
02:00:34.185,02:00:35.937,"Paco, help your sister!"
02:00:55.831,02:00:56.958,Sofi!
02:01:07.176,02:01:08.219,Paco!
02:01:13.766,02:01:14.850,Paco!
02:01:19.063,02:01:20.022,Paco!
02:01:24.360,02:01:25.319,Sofi!
02:01:28.155,02:01:29.156,Sofi!
02:01:40.001,02:01:41.127,Sofi!
02:01:45.089,02:01:46.048,Sofi.
02:02:43.314,02:02:47.151,"What happened? Are you okay, my love?"
02:02:48.152,02:02:49.528,Cleo saved us.
02:02:50.404,02:02:52.198,Thank you... Thank you.
02:02:53.240,02:02:54.283,Are you okay?
02:03:02.708,02:03:05.544,-I didn't want her. -They're okay.
02:03:09.131,02:03:11.509,I didn't want her to be born.
02:03:16.597,02:03:18.224,"We love you so much, Cleo."
02:03:19.225,02:03:21.018,-Right? -Poor little thing.
02:03:25.481,02:03:27.525,"We love you so, so much."
02:04:31.839,02:04:33.299,"I love you, Cleo."
02:04:33.924,02:04:35.593,"I love you too, darling."
02:05:31.190,02:05:34.944,"Hey, Toño, Sofi, Paco, come help. Don't play dumb."
02:05:55.339,02:05:57.299,"-Can I leave this with you? -Yes, ma'am."
02:06:03.097,02:06:04.390,It looks awful.
02:06:05.349,02:06:07.351,"Without the bookshelves, it's awful."
02:06:39.508,02:06:41.802,"-Sofi and Paco almost drowned. -Oh, no!"
02:06:41.885,02:06:44.680,"Hi, Cleo. Mrs. Sofi's room is there."
02:06:44.763,02:06:45.681,Thank you.
02:06:50.769,02:06:54.273,"-Cleo, check out my room! -In a bit, okay?"
02:07:16.420,02:07:19.506,"Sure, whenever you like. Mrs. Molly is on the phone."
02:07:19.590,02:07:20.633,"Ah, thank you."
02:07:23.177,02:07:24.720,"Yes, the current carries us away."
02:07:24.803,02:07:29.391,"-The waves were 15 meters tall. -No, they were only two meters."
02:07:29.475,02:07:33.062,"-No, they were taller! -And Cleo saved us. Right, Cleo?"
02:07:33.729,02:07:36.023,"-Cleo, can I have a banana smoothie? -Yes."
02:07:36.106,02:07:37.691,-Me too. -Are there any Gansitos?
02:07:37.775,02:07:41.320,"-Let me check. -Yes, I got a box."
02:08:44.508,02:08:49.847,For Libo.
