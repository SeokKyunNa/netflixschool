00:00:40.749,00:00:46.921,"She taught me how to spell my name, W-I-L-L-O-WD-E-A-N."
00:00:47.422,00:00:48.339,Willowdean.
00:00:48.882,00:00:51.426,She also taught me how to like a name like that.
00:01:14.115,00:01:15.992,just meant she was too busy for me.
00:01:16.409,00:01:26.086,"So my Aunt Lucy was the one who taught me how to say Yes, ma'am, and No, sir, how to look people in the eye, and how to find a keeper in a heap of junk."
00:01:26.169,00:01:31.382,"But most of all, my Aunt Lucy taught me about Dolly Parton."
00:01:45.438,00:01:49.400,"Oh, my God, do you see her? You are honestly a pig."
00:01:51.111,00:01:52.278,Go on and git!
00:01:56.783,00:01:58.743,"Pay them no mind, Willowdean."
00:01:58.827,00:02:04.499,"The world is filled with people that are gonna try to tell you who you are, but that's for you to decide, you hear me?"
00:02:07.001,00:02:09.796,She always seemed to know exactly what to say to me.
00:02:12.048,00:02:15.009,It's hard being a diamond in a rhinestone world.
00:02:15.468,00:02:16.719,Now let's go get ready.
00:02:21.432,00:02:23.810,My mom never came to those 'cause...
00:02:23.893,00:02:26.688,"I don't think she really understood them or us, really."
00:02:28.148,00:02:36.197,It's funny how you can look at the same things until something unexpected suddenly changes how you see everything.
00:02:36.281,00:02:37.657,Hi. So good to see you.
00:02:38.741,00:02:42.120,"Willowdean, this is Ellen and this is her mom."
00:02:46.916,00:02:52.255,I think my Aunt Lucy knew exactly what she was doing the day Ellen Dryver showed up at our door.
00:03:10.565,00:03:14.319,Elle and I once wrote Dolly Parton a thank you letter for giving us each other.
00:03:14.569,00:03:15.612,She wrote back.
00:03:15.945,00:03:20.200,The greatest friends have nothing and everything in common all at once.
00:03:20.283,00:03:23.912,Sounds like you two girls are different versions of the same story.
00:03:24.370,00:03:25.788,"Love, Dolly."
00:04:04.535,00:04:13.628,Sometimes I think my Aunt Lucy gave me Dolly and Elle to get through the one thing she couldn't teach me herself: how to live in this world without her.
00:04:16.339,00:04:21.844,"I guess as Dolly would say, If you want the rainbow, you have to put up with the rain."
00:04:30.603,00:04:35.817,Okay. That Patrick Thomas is ten pounds of stupid in a five-pound bag.
00:04:37.235,00:04:39.070,Boy needs a swift kick in the pants.
00:04:44.534,00:04:50.707,"Lucy would bring us here and blast Dolly on her boombox, and buy us cherry-lime snow cones."
00:04:50.790,00:04:52.583,But only on Mondays...
00:04:58.006,00:05:01.676,I don't know how I'm gonna survive my mom's pageant season without her.
00:05:02.010,00:05:03.970,She already started her diet.
00:05:05.054,00:05:05.888,Already?
00:05:09.017,00:05:12.812,I gotta zip up that dress come October. It's tradition.
00:05:12.895,00:05:15.064,"Ugh, my life with the ex-beauty queen."
00:05:15.148,00:05:18.318,Our fridge has been reduced to bunny food and condiments.
00:05:32.749,00:05:35.376,I have to confess something or I think I might go straight to hell.
00:05:37.003,00:05:42.008,"Whenever I see Millie Mitchellchuck, I think, I'm fat, but at least I'm not clueless."
00:05:42.091,00:05:43.551,"Oh, I don't know."
00:05:43.926,00:05:45.219,She always seems happy.
00:05:48.056,00:05:50.016,"Yeah, she does."
00:05:51.309,00:05:52.143,Hey!
00:05:52.226,00:05:53.353,Get back here!
00:05:59.525,00:06:00.401,Hi.
00:06:04.322,00:06:05.198,Um...
00:06:05.656,00:06:06.491,Will...
00:06:06.824,00:06:09.077,you remember Callie who works with me at Sweet 16?
00:06:09.160,00:06:11.454,-Hey. -Hi. It's nice to see you.
00:06:14.916,00:06:17.251,Will's mom is the pageant director.
00:06:17.335,00:06:19.796,She was Miss Teen Bluebonnet in 1991.
00:06:20.421,00:06:22.882,Rosie Dickson's your mom? Really?
00:06:23.174,00:06:24.258,Far as I know.
00:06:24.842,00:06:31.557,"Hey, maybe sometime Elle Belle and I could come over and I could ask your mom some questions about the pageant."
00:06:31.641,00:06:33.476,"You know, just casually."
00:06:33.559,00:06:36.354,"Well, unfortunately, my mom's not home all that much."
00:06:36.437,00:06:40.316,She's either at pageant meetings or at the nursing home wiping old peoples' butts.
00:06:40.817,00:06:43.277,It's what happens to a lot of ex-beauty queens.
00:06:49.784,00:06:50.660,Okay.
00:06:53.287,00:06:54.747,"-Um, see y'all later? -Okay."
00:06:54.831,00:06:56.249,-Bye. -Bye. Say hi to Morgan.
00:06:57.333,00:06:59.836,"Okay, what was that all about? She's harmless."
00:07:03.423,00:07:04.966,"-Hey, Tim. -Hey, Will."
00:07:06.426,00:07:07.343,"Bye, Tim."
00:07:09.262,00:07:11.305,And for today's grand prize...
00:07:11.389,00:07:16.269,name the billboard hit that features the sound of a typewriter off the Odd Jobs album.
00:07:16.352,00:07:17.520,9 to 5?
00:07:17.603,00:07:19.313,We have a winner.
00:07:27.905,00:07:28.990,Come here.
00:08:22.835,00:08:24.295,Heard you the first three times.
00:08:26.005,00:08:26.839,Willowdean.
00:08:26.923,00:08:27.757,Mmm.
00:08:28.132,00:08:28.966,"Hi, Bo."
00:08:40.061,00:08:42.480,"-Hey, Marcus. -Hey, what's up, Will."
00:08:44.732,00:08:46.400,Why does table seven look angry?
00:08:48.027,00:08:53.824,"Oh, I forgot to put their order in again. But it's three combos, give me one sec-- It's okay, I got it. Just make three chocolate shakes stat."
00:08:53.908,00:08:55.117,"Thank you, Will."
00:08:55.201,00:08:56.160,Bo?
00:08:56.244,00:08:58.246,How fast can you whip up three combos?
00:08:58.329,00:08:59.247,Time me.
00:09:04.502,00:09:06.295,We have a winner.
00:09:06.379,00:09:10.591,"We just had our end of summer drawing, and it's lucky table seven."
00:09:10.675,00:09:14.720,Y'all just won free shakes with your combos and your meal's on the house.
00:09:14.804,00:09:19.642,"Looks like it's gonna be a dessert-first kind of day, 'cause Fridays don't deserve all the attention."
00:09:22.895,00:09:24.897,Come on! Let's hear it for the winners!
00:09:25.940,00:09:26.941,You're a genius.
00:09:30.194,00:09:31.946,"I did say hold the salmonella, right?"
00:09:32.029,00:09:34.115,Hopefully our winners make it out alive.
00:09:53.759,00:09:54.635,Dumplin'.
00:09:54.969,00:09:57.513,Mom! That name.
00:10:00.141,00:10:01.309,Unh-unh. Unh-unh.
00:10:01.684,00:10:03.519,"I can't be late, Dumplin'."
00:10:03.603,00:10:09.609,"I am the guest of honor, so will you please go upstairs and put on that floral dress that I got you for Mimi's wedding?"
00:10:13.195,00:10:14.739,A well-styled head of hair...
00:10:14.822,00:10:17.199,Is a head above the rest. I know.
00:10:18.034,00:10:21.454,"The thing is, I kind of forgot about tonight."
00:10:22.038,00:10:23.623,I already made plans with Elle.
00:10:24.123,00:10:25.166,We made a deal.
00:10:26.417,00:10:29.295,This cannot exactly drive itself.
00:10:29.378,00:10:30.254,Okay?
00:10:30.796,00:10:32.381,Bring Elle. She'll love it.
00:10:33.174,00:10:34.675,Do I have any holes back here?
00:10:40.473,00:10:41.307,Oh.
00:10:42.016,00:10:42.850,Baby?
00:10:44.101,00:10:46.520,You got a little breakout there on your forehead.
00:10:47.438,00:10:50.358,"You're not eating that greasy stuff over at Harpy's, right?"
00:10:50.566,00:10:53.569,"Mom, you know I don't even like burgers and hotdogs."
00:10:54.070,00:10:55.071,"Yeah, but..."
00:10:56.864,00:10:59.158,You've got a hole on your left by the way.
00:10:59.241,00:11:00.076,What?
00:11:00.409,00:11:03.579,All right. Will you please tell Elle that she's got to be ready in ten?
00:11:03.663,00:11:05.081,She doesn't listen to me.
00:11:06.082,00:11:07.124,That's fine.
00:11:07.208,00:11:09.168,I know. Close enough.
00:11:09.251,00:11:10.086,Yeah.
00:11:17.927,00:11:19.178,The other side.
00:11:21.055,00:11:23.099,"-Okay, darlin', just grab my ankles. -Uh-huh."
00:11:23.182,00:11:24.517,-Okay. -Okay. Mm-hmm.
00:11:24.600,00:11:25.434,Good. Okay.
00:11:25.518,00:11:26.435,"Oh, God."
00:11:27.853,00:11:29.271,-Here. -All right. I got it.
00:11:29.355,00:11:30.815,-Okay. -All right.
00:11:30.898,00:11:31.941,Did I hit my...
00:11:32.024,00:11:32.858,Okay.
00:11:34.318,00:11:35.194,"Thank you, Ellen."
00:11:35.444,00:11:37.071,-You're welcome. -I'm sorry.
00:11:37.154,00:11:39.115,"-Will you hold that, please, for a second? -Mm-hmm."
00:11:40.408,00:11:41.409,"Oh, my gosh."
00:11:42.034,00:11:42.910,Thank you.
00:11:43.369,00:11:44.912,"Wow, you really just parked..."
00:11:45.454,00:11:47.248,"Well, there are no spots."
00:11:51.877,00:11:54.046,"Oh, my gosh, it's starting already."
00:11:54.505,00:11:55.381,Oh.
00:11:59.260,00:12:00.136,I just...
00:12:00.469,00:12:02.263,I just wish they all could win.
00:12:02.972,00:12:04.265,They work so hard.
00:12:05.307,00:12:08.811,"Yes. Walking is so, so hard."
00:12:10.604,00:12:12.273,Miss Teen Bluebonnet.
00:12:12.356,00:12:14.817,"Oh, Miss Teen Sweetwater!"
00:12:14.900,00:12:16.026,"Oh, my Lord, look at you."
00:12:16.110,00:12:19.447,"-You haven't aged a minute. -Oh, it's the backstage lighting."
00:12:19.530,00:12:21.198,Thank you so much for making the trip.
00:12:21.282,00:12:25.035,"Oh, please. I would've driven a million miles to support those girls."
00:12:25.119,00:12:27.496,It's just such a nice treat to have a special guest.
00:12:27.580,00:12:29.957,That audience is plum tired of seeing my face out there.
00:12:32.835,00:12:34.003,"Really, trust me."
00:12:34.712,00:12:38.758,"My, it looks like the Miss America pageant out there."
00:12:38.841,00:12:39.800,Thank you.
00:12:40.217,00:12:43.262,Those backdrops really give our social media a nice pop.
00:12:43.345,00:12:45.723,-Social media? -Yeah. Hashtag pop.
00:12:45.806,00:12:46.640,Oh!
00:12:46.724,00:12:50.853,Hoping to give you Bluebonnets a run for your money this year in that Best Pageant award. Look out!
00:12:50.936,00:12:54.064,"Oh, well. Best keep an eye on those hemlines then."
00:12:54.148,00:12:56.609,-'Cause they're looking a little short. -Well.
00:12:57.651,00:12:59.403,This must be your daughter.
00:12:59.487,00:13:01.655,"Oh, no. That's Ellen, my daughter's best friend."
00:13:01.739,00:13:03.699,"This is my daughter, Willowdean."
00:13:04.116,00:13:05.951,Wow. Okay.
00:13:06.243,00:13:07.620,So nice to meet you both.
00:13:07.703,00:13:09.246,-So great meeting you too. -Both of you.
00:13:11.165,00:13:12.708,"-Delia Shepherd. -Okay, gotta go."
00:13:12.792,00:13:13.834,Okay. Have fun.
00:13:20.424,00:13:21.425,Good evening.
00:13:21.509,00:13:23.552,-It is my special duty... -Oh.
00:13:23.636,00:13:26.722,...to introduce a very special guest tonight.
00:13:26.806,00:13:43.823,"To crown this year's Miss Teen Sweetwater, my fellow former, and the director of the Bluebonnet pageant, ten-time recipient of the best Texas pageant award, please welcome Clover City's Miss Teen 1991, Miss Rosie Dickson."
00:13:49.328,00:13:50.913,"Thank you, Miss Delia."
00:13:51.330,00:13:56.252,"And girls, might I just say, y'all look stunning tonight."
00:14:00.256,00:14:05.052,to your new Miss Teen Sweetwater...
00:14:05.135,00:14:07.888,Miss Darlene Williams.
00:14:10.683,00:14:12.059,"Come on, girl."
00:14:14.311,00:14:15.437,Beautiful!
00:14:44.967,00:14:50.097,"your host of all the hits, reminding listeners to sign up for the 85th annual Miss Teen Bluebonnet pageant."
00:14:50.180,00:14:51.307,It's just around the corner.
00:15:25.925,00:15:27.760,Come on in. I'll cook you a burger or something.
00:15:27.843,00:15:29.219,-Gotta roll. -Good to see you.
00:15:29.303,00:15:31.055,-All right. -Good to see you. Have a good one.
00:15:35.351,00:15:36.602,"Hey, where are you going?"
00:15:39.063,00:15:39.897,Hi.
00:15:40.606,00:15:41.523,So...
00:15:42.066,00:15:44.234,"Those are your rich prep school friends, hey?"
00:15:44.818,00:15:47.613,Y'all are so lucky you have two more weeks left of summer.
00:15:47.696,00:15:50.199,"You know, not everyone who goes to Holy Cross is rich."
00:15:50.282,00:15:52.368,"No, I didn't mean it like that. I just..."
00:15:52.826,00:15:57.873,"You know, like, rich or poor, we all have to deal with the same prepare for the future thing."
00:15:58.374,00:15:59.208,Like...
00:15:59.625,00:16:06.465,"Kind of like we're supposed to have some big plan mapped out, when most of the adults in this town don't even know what they want to be when they grow up, so..."
00:16:09.426,00:16:10.803,If only they had a Magic 8-Ball.
00:16:17.142,00:16:18.310,"Thanks, by the way."
00:16:18.644,00:16:19.770,"Weirdly, I..."
00:16:20.396,00:16:21.981,always wanted one of these.
00:16:34.076,00:16:36.328,"Well, I guess we'd better send flowers."
00:16:38.539,00:16:39.498,Come on.
00:16:39.581,00:16:40.791,Better get back to work.
00:17:06.025,00:17:07.026,You scared me.
00:17:15.576,00:17:18.370,"Dumplin', I don't want to talk about this right now."
00:17:18.454,00:17:20.998,We agreed that we would do this before the end of summer.
00:17:21.081,00:17:23.751,"Mom, she's been gone six months."
00:17:24.460,00:17:25.836,When can we talk about her?
00:17:29.673,00:17:31.884,What are you planning on doing with everything?
00:17:33.552,00:17:34.803,"Well, I don't-- I mean..."
00:17:36.096,00:17:37.765,I guess we'll donate most of it.
00:17:38.515,00:17:40.392,She was such a pack rat.
00:17:44.229,00:17:45.230,Room for what?
00:17:45.314,00:17:50.652,"Without Lucy's extra income, I am gonna have to start doing alterations so that we can make ends meet."
00:17:51.195,00:17:53.530,You mean alterations for the pageant?
00:17:55.824,00:17:56.784,"Yes, Willowdean."
00:17:57.618,00:17:58.911,For the pageant.
00:18:04.625,00:18:09.338,"Yeah, well, I want to look through everything before it gets donated."
00:18:13.842,00:18:14.760,"Yes, ma'am."
00:18:16.011,00:18:17.513,"Will, come on."
00:18:17.763,00:18:19.014,Aren't you ready?
00:18:19.807,00:18:22.476,I don't want to be late. It's our first day of school.
00:18:25.896,00:18:27.648,Are you threatening to move out?
00:18:30.818,00:18:32.945,My mom's packing up Lucy's room.
00:18:34.279,00:18:37.282,"Mmm. Well, you should keep as much of it as you want."
00:18:37.783,00:18:41.245,I really want to find that bee brooch of hers. I loved that.
00:18:41.328,00:18:43.455,"Yeah, reminds me of her, too."
00:18:43.747,00:18:46.208,"You know, that little bit of flair she always had."
00:18:50.170,00:18:51.004,Hmm.
00:18:52.047,00:18:52.881,When'd you get this?
00:18:54.258,00:18:55.884,Prep school Bo gave it to me.
00:18:56.343,00:18:58.637,"You know that means he likes you, right?"
00:18:59.471,00:19:00.806,He does not.
00:19:01.390,00:19:04.476,He's... nice to everybody. He just...
00:19:04.560,00:19:06.270,"-I don't know, he's just like that. -Mm-hmm."
00:19:06.353,00:19:08.147,So he gave everybody one of these?
00:19:09.022,00:19:10.607,"Okay, Will. Um..."
00:19:11.483,00:19:17.447,Boys don't give girls sweet little presents unless they're trying to get their attention. That's a fact.
00:19:18.657,00:19:19.491,Elle...
00:19:19.867,00:19:21.994,boys like Bo don't date girls like me.
00:19:22.536,00:19:23.537,That's a fact.
00:19:23.620,00:19:28.292,"Look, he just wants to be friends so he can ask me questions about girls he actually likes."
00:19:30.169,00:19:31.086,Is that true?
00:19:33.255,00:19:34.089,Mmm.
00:19:34.173,00:19:36.216,My sources say no. Told you.
00:19:37.384,00:19:38.510,"Look, I can't be late."
00:19:38.594,00:19:39.595,I'll meet you there.
00:19:42.848,00:19:46.018,"Well, Sweetwater is working hard to keep up with the times."
00:19:46.101,00:19:47.769,Which is a fool's errand if you ask me.
00:19:49.813,00:19:50.731,Mm-hmm.
00:19:53.984,00:19:54.860,"Oh, hold on a sec."
00:19:54.943,00:19:56.445,"Honey, I made extra."
00:19:56.987,00:19:59.448,It's okay. I'm just gonna take a banana so I'm not late.
00:19:59.531,00:20:00.490,Why...
00:20:00.574,00:20:02.951,"-All right, have a great first day. -Thanks."
00:20:09.208,00:20:13.212,these city pageants are just getting more and more generic every year.
00:20:15.881,00:20:17.633,It's like they just popped up out of nowhere.
00:20:20.219,00:20:23.055,she might be able to get us a few extra decorations.
00:20:24.848,00:20:26.642,-I'm gonna have to call you back. -All right.
00:20:31.647,00:20:35.025,We are not doing a Beyoncé song for the opening number.
00:20:35.108,00:20:39.238,Our bylaws strictly outline the lyrics and music deemed appropriate.
00:20:39.321,00:20:41.573,It is my job to uphold those guidelines...
00:20:44.409,00:20:45.827,"-I agree. -Okay, hold on one second."
00:20:45.911,00:20:51.458,"All right, honey, I'm gonna call Joe's Garage, get your car towed, and we'll find out what's wrong, okay?"
00:20:51.541,00:20:52.501,Thank you.
00:20:55.254,00:20:57.172,"So, anyway... Oh, Dumplin'!"
00:21:02.177,00:21:03.637,Forgot your phone.
00:21:14.439,00:21:15.732,"Well, you're welcome."
00:21:19.736,00:21:20.696,So sorry.
00:21:26.576,00:21:28.328,My mom just happened.
00:21:29.997,00:21:33.417,"Oh, God. Everybody heard. It was so embarrassing, Elle."
00:21:33.500,00:21:36.378,Here comes Dumplin'!
00:21:36.461,00:21:38.171,"Just ignore him, he's an idiot."
00:21:39.214,00:21:40.924,"-Oh, dude, it's Millie. -Whoops!"
00:21:41.341,00:21:43.218,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!"
00:21:43.302,00:21:45.220,Guess they need to widen the hallways.
00:21:55.689,00:21:56.732,Good aim.
00:22:06.575,00:22:08.910,I've never heard of such a thing. What is wrong with you?
00:22:08.994,00:22:11.705,-Me? It's your fault. -My fault?
00:22:11.788,00:22:17.002,I was just defending myself against a bully who was calling me that hideous nickname you've been calling me my whole life.
00:22:17.085,00:22:19.087,"-He deserved it. -Have a lovely day, Miss Dickson."
00:22:19.171,00:22:20.672,"Why, you, too, Miss Hall."
00:22:21.089,00:22:22.591,"Listen to me, young lady."
00:22:22.674,00:22:25.802,Why are you getting all sensitive about a silly little nickname?
00:22:25.886,00:22:29.306,"Mom, we know this is about so much more than just a nickname."
00:22:29.806,00:22:34.019,"You'll never come out and say it, but I know you can't stand that your daughter looks like this."
00:22:34.102,00:22:36.229,-What? -Like a round little dumpling.
00:22:36.313,00:22:37.522,"Oh, that is not true."
00:22:37.606,00:22:39.816,"-Oh, please. I don't fit in your world. -That is not true."
00:22:39.900,00:22:43.612,"-I get it. -Listen, I just want you to have opportunities, all right?"
00:22:43.695,00:22:45.364,It is harder for big girls.
00:22:45.447,00:22:46.990,"I was one, I know."
00:22:47.074,00:22:48.992,Okay? Luce and I both were.
00:22:49.076,00:22:58.752,"-You know that. -Yeah, I've heard the story about how you lost the weight the summer before high school and Lucy didn't, and you went on to win the Miss Teen pageant, quite literally your last crowning achievement."
00:22:58.835,00:23:01.421,"Watch your tone with me, young lady. I am still your mother."
00:23:02.005,00:23:07.344,"For the record, we both know who raised me, and she never once made me feel bad about myself."
00:23:08.345,00:23:10.597,I really wish you didn't idolize her so much.
00:23:11.473,00:23:13.975,"If she took better care of herself, she'd probably still be here."
00:23:14.059,00:23:16.770,You were always so focused on her weight.
00:23:17.437,00:23:19.731,You never even really got to know who she was.
00:23:19.815,00:23:21.191,Do you even miss her?
00:23:22.067,00:23:24.361,Forget it. I'm walking home.
00:23:30.283,00:23:40.293,"Well, I am sorry that I didn't get to go to all your Dolly Parton parties because I had to go to work to put a roof over your head, because that's what mothers do."
00:24:57.412,00:24:58.371,Up here.
00:24:58.455,00:25:02.584,"I can't believe you got suspended on the first day of school, you overachiever."
00:25:05.420,00:25:06.546,Brought your homework.
00:25:07.339,00:25:08.173,What're you doing?
00:25:09.341,00:25:10.300,Look at this.
00:25:15.597,00:25:17.057,Lucy never said a word.
00:25:17.140,00:25:24.189,"Looks like she thought about doing the pageant, but she obviously didn't feel welcome with people like my mom lording over it with their measuring tape."
00:25:24.898,00:25:26.274,I know that look.
00:25:28.235,00:25:29.277,What's going on?
00:25:31.571,00:25:35.200,I think I'm gonna sign up for the pageant and do what Lucy never could.
00:25:35.951,00:25:40.121,I wanna march right in there on sign-up day just to see the look on my mom's face.
00:25:40.580,00:25:43.792,She's always been embarrassed by me. Now she'll have good reason.
00:25:46.795,00:25:48.463,Kind of like a protest in heels?
00:25:48.547,00:25:49.673,Exactly.
00:25:49.923,00:25:51.508,Like a protest in heels.
00:25:55.720,00:25:58.098,How does your mom walk in these torture devices?
00:25:58.890,00:26:00.058,I don't think she does.
00:26:01.768,00:26:04.020,"-Oh, yeah. -Is that Rosie Dickson's daughter?"
00:26:17.701,00:26:18.785,That's brave.
00:26:28.628,00:26:29.713,"Hey, y'all."
00:26:30.297,00:26:31.965,"If you're signing up, I am too."
00:26:32.549,00:26:34.384,"Uh, what? No."
00:26:34.467,00:26:36.970,"No, I'm not the Joan of Arc of fat girls, okay?"
00:26:37.053,00:26:38.597,This is a bad idea. Go home.
00:26:38.680,00:26:40.765,All my favorite things start off as bad ideas.
00:26:41.433,00:26:42.684,"Millie, no."
00:26:44.269,00:26:46.313,Remember? We're here for Lucy.
00:26:48.523,00:26:52.193,"Fine. Do what you want, just don't crowd me."
00:26:55.071,00:26:57.532,"You're missing a parent's signature, darlin'."
00:26:58.033,00:27:00.702,You can't participate without a parent's signature.
00:27:01.953,00:27:03.204,Willowdean Opal.
00:27:06.916,00:27:07.959,Thank you.
00:27:17.427,00:27:19.220,Are you trying to get back at me for something?
00:27:22.140,00:27:23.266,is to get revenge?
00:27:24.142,00:27:27.062,"I'm Rosie Dickson's daughter, it runs in my blood."
00:27:27.646,00:27:31.524,"Besides, as far as I'm concerned, a swimsuit body is a body with a swimsuit on it."
00:27:35.028,00:27:36.279,I will not...
00:27:36.780,00:27:45.914,"have you make a mockery of me or this institution, which has been a cornerstone of our community-- Since 1933. I know."
00:27:46.206,00:27:49.000,"I could probably recite your bylaws by now, I've heard 'em so many times."
00:27:52.629,00:27:55.048,You know you can't enter unless I sign that form.
00:27:57.509,00:27:58.968,-Mom? -Mm-hmm?
00:27:59.052,00:28:03.181,"If you don't sign that form, you're saying I'm not good enough."
00:28:04.474,00:28:10.480,You're saying that every girl in this room is more deserving than me because I'm not built like them.
00:28:11.773,00:28:13.274,That I don't belong here.
00:28:15.318,00:28:16.695,Is that what you're saying?
00:28:19.823,00:28:20.657,Well...
00:28:30.834,00:28:32.127,It's a surprise.
00:28:44.973,00:28:46.474,No special treatment.
00:28:46.558,00:28:48.017,-Wouldn't expect it. -Okay.
00:28:52.605,00:28:54.691,Pageants are harder than you think.
00:29:05.535,00:29:07.203,Oh... my God.
00:29:09.289,00:29:10.790,Did you see the color of her skirt?
00:29:20.341,00:29:23.678,Yay! This is gonna be so much fun.
00:29:24.262,00:29:25.388,Totally fun.
00:29:25.472,00:29:27.307,"The name's Hannah, glossy lady."
00:29:31.811,00:29:33.062,Whatever do you mean?
00:29:34.773,00:29:36.065,And what's your story?
00:29:36.816,00:29:39.569,"Hi there. And, mothers, thank you so much for coming."
00:29:39.652,00:29:42.197,"We'll have your daughters back to you in just a jiffy, okay?"
00:29:42.280,00:29:43.156,"So, thank you."
00:29:43.490,00:29:47.327,"Oh, my God. I am so excited that you're signing up."
00:29:48.745,00:29:50.163,Did you see that Bekah Colter?
00:29:50.747,00:29:52.457,She is our competition.
00:29:54.250,00:29:59.339,"Well, I would like to welcome you to the Clover City Miss Teen Bluebonnet pageant."
00:29:59.923,00:30:04.677,The first beauty pageant established in the great state of Texas.
00:30:06.638,00:30:08.348,Back in 1933.
00:30:11.643,00:30:13.895,"Now, the next six weeks are gonna be a whirlwind."
00:30:13.978,00:30:16.564,Someone in this very room...
00:30:18.066,00:30:20.819,...will be this year's Miss Teen Bluebonnet.
00:30:26.241,00:30:27.450,Do you think you're ready?
00:30:29.452,00:30:30.620,"Good luck, girls."
00:30:36.751,00:30:39.921,that tickets go on sale today for our Miss Teen Bluebonnet pageant.
00:30:40.004,00:30:43.466,Only five weeks away. Let's kick it off with this great hit.
00:30:49.973,00:30:50.849,Millie?
00:30:55.311,00:30:56.187,Millie?
00:31:00.859,00:31:05.530,-What are you doin'? -I thought Pageant Bootcamp would be a nice way to get to know some of the girls.
00:31:05.905,00:31:07.991,I just have to blend in in case my mom drops by.
00:31:08.074,00:31:09.576,Blend in.
00:31:11.035,00:31:12.370,"Why, Millie? Why?"
00:31:12.453,00:31:15.248,'Cause I forged my mom's signature on my pageant application.
00:31:15.665,00:31:17.458,She thinks I joined Needlepoint Club.
00:31:17.542,00:31:20.795,"Millie, it's gonna be near impossible keeping your mom from finding out about this."
00:31:20.879,00:31:24.132,"Well, I don't have a choice. When I asked her, she said no."
00:31:24.215,00:31:26.676,"A church no, which means don't ask again."
00:31:27.218,00:31:29.387,So I just got to stay one step ahead of her.
00:31:32.265,00:31:33.391,"You're fat, you're fat."
00:31:33.474,00:31:35.518,-Eat shit. -We'll pray for you.
00:31:35.602,00:31:36.644,"Bye, Will."
00:31:41.441,00:31:42.275,-Will. -Mm-hmm.
00:31:42.358,00:31:44.360,"Okay, uh, Ron wants us to hang these up."
00:31:44.944,00:31:47.655,"Oh, and, um, your friends are here at table six."
00:31:47.739,00:31:48.573,"All right, hold on."
00:31:53.453,00:31:56.122,"Well, maybe we can brainstorm some other ideas."
00:31:56.205,00:31:57.498,What are you guys doin' here?
00:31:57.582,00:32:01.085,"Hey, Will. We were gonna see if you'd join our pageant meeting when you take your break."
00:32:01.169,00:32:03.755,I made one for each of us.
00:32:05.381,00:32:08.259,"I... really don't need one, thanks."
00:32:09.594,00:32:11.387,"Oh, uh, Will, could you grab that, please?"
00:32:14.682,00:32:17.977,"So as I was saying, for the talent portion we really have to play to our strength."
00:32:18.061,00:32:19.979,And some of my strengths are singing.
00:32:20.063,00:32:21.814,I'm a worship leader at church.
00:32:21.898,00:32:24.525,"And I hula hoop, and I can tap dance."
00:32:24.609,00:32:27.278,"If I do all that at the same time, that could be really neat."
00:32:27.362,00:32:29.948,"Really. Like, no one's ever done that before, right?"
00:32:30.448,00:32:32.075,So. Thank you.
00:32:32.158,00:32:37.997,"As long as we play to our strengths and bring our showmanship, we've got as good a chance to win this pageant as anyone else."
00:32:38.081,00:32:42.001,"And a lot of pageant winners go on to do very important things, -like Willowdean's mom. -Millie."
00:32:42.085,00:32:44.671,I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding.
00:32:45.922,00:32:48.508,We're not actually trying to win the pageant.
00:32:49.342,00:32:50.259,We're not?
00:32:50.677,00:32:51.511,"Well, I'm not."
00:32:51.594,00:32:54.347,"And I don't know what her deal is, but..."
00:32:59.978,00:33:02.605,It's a protest. We're trying to make a point.
00:33:02.689,00:33:04.691,"-Count me in. -Well, what's our point?"
00:33:09.153,00:33:11.698,unconsciously internalized by the female psyche.
00:33:13.700,00:33:15.702,-Oh. -In other words...
00:33:16.494,00:33:17.829,We're Spartacus...
00:33:17.912,00:33:20.164,and the pageant is the Roman Empire.
00:33:25.336,00:33:26.379,Anybody?
00:33:28.965,00:33:31.467,"-Okay, okay. Hey. -Oh, no."
00:33:33.469,00:33:35.680,Every revolution starts small.
00:33:36.055,00:33:37.724,I don't want to revolt.
00:33:38.808,00:33:41.728,I've wanted to do this pageant since I was eight years old.
00:33:46.357,00:33:52.697,"is that yes, we are still technically doing the pageant, and it'll still be fun. It's just..."
00:33:56.492,00:34:00.705,Maybe a little bit more than a bit. Like... way back.
00:34:01.581,00:34:02.415,"Okay, then."
00:34:03.583,00:34:04.500,Good meeting.
00:34:06.210,00:34:07.045,Oh.
00:34:08.171,00:34:10.715,And let me know when you're ready to take this thing down.
00:34:14.719,00:34:19.557,"Okay, Millie, you can show me your binder now, but after that we have to put it away, okay?"
00:34:20.349,00:34:21.350,Okay.
00:34:21.851,00:34:25.730,"Well, I made yours yellow because you remind me of sunshine."
00:34:25.938,00:34:28.649,"-Aw! -So, for your talent, I was thinking..."
00:34:37.033,00:34:38.367,-Here. -I got it.
00:34:39.911,00:34:40.787,Thank you.
00:34:44.916,00:34:45.750,Hey.
00:34:46.834,00:34:49.504,"There's a, uh... small meteor shower tonight."
00:34:49.879,00:34:52.548,"I don't know if you're into that sort of thing, but..."
00:34:52.632,00:34:55.343,"you know, could still be cool to see."
00:34:55.885,00:34:56.969,If you're interested.
00:34:58.137,00:34:58.971,Okay.
00:34:59.972,00:35:00.807,Sure.
00:35:02.183,00:35:03.017,Cool.
00:35:21.828,00:35:22.662,Hey.
00:35:23.454,00:35:24.288,Hi.
00:35:27.291,00:35:29.502,-You want me to come up there? -Yeah.
00:35:30.711,00:35:31.587,Okay.
00:35:34.674,00:35:36.259,"Best seat in the house, right here."
00:35:43.850,00:35:45.476,It's a real pretty night.
00:35:45.893,00:35:46.811,Yeah.
00:35:50.857,00:35:52.817,-Can I ask you something? -Sure.
00:35:54.402,00:35:57.280,"What's the deal with that, uh... photo?"
00:35:57.989,00:35:59.782,Um... in your locker?
00:36:00.449,00:36:02.410,"That girl-- uh, woman."
00:36:02.743,00:36:04.495,You don't know who Dolly Parton is?
00:36:05.413,00:36:06.247,Should I?
00:36:06.956,00:36:11.210,"She's, like, one of the greatest singer-songwriters of all time."
00:36:11.460,00:36:13.171,She's kind of hard not to know.
00:36:13.629,00:36:14.589,Oh.
00:36:14.922,00:36:15.756,Okay.
00:36:16.465,00:36:17.383,Uh...
00:36:17.466,00:36:18.467,Why her?
00:36:20.344,00:36:21.762,My Aunt Lucy loved her.
00:36:22.930,00:36:25.433,I was probably singing Dolly before I could talk.
00:36:26.642,00:36:28.853,There's just something amazing about her.
00:36:28.936,00:36:34.525,"You know, she's in on every joke you could possibly tell about her, and she's got this wicked sense of humor and..."
00:36:34.859,00:36:37.278,"And it's like she's always one step ahead, you know?"
00:37:04.680,00:37:05.598,Uh...
00:37:06.349,00:37:07.600,It's getting really late.
00:37:07.683,00:37:09.393,I... I got to get home.
00:37:09.477,00:37:10.311,Where...
00:37:11.646,00:37:13.022,Where are you go-- What did I do?
00:37:13.105,00:37:15.900,Nothing. I... I just... I got to get home.
00:37:15.983,00:37:17.443,Thanks for the meteor.
00:37:22.782,00:37:24.283,It's your time to shine.
00:37:26.118,00:37:29.038,"Punch away those storms, you guys. The storms of life."
00:37:29.121,00:37:31.249,"Breathe out. One, two, three."
00:37:58.526,00:37:59.819,Thanks for the meteor?
00:38:00.945,00:38:02.154,So stupid!
00:38:03.990,00:38:06.450,I'm giving away two tickets to the Miss Teen Bluebonnet pageant.
00:38:06.534,00:38:09.412,Only four weeks to the big day and seats are selling fast.
00:38:11.247,00:38:12.957,Why are we even going to this?
00:38:14.583,00:38:17.378,"You're the one who got into a bullfight with your mom, remember?"
00:38:19.964,00:38:22.300,"Don't worry, we'll make it fun."
00:38:26.762,00:38:28.597,"Okay, what's up?"
00:38:34.145,00:38:35.938,Bo kissed me last night.
00:38:37.106,00:38:37.940,What?!
00:38:38.482,00:38:40.484,"-I told you! -Okay, okay."
00:38:43.237,00:38:45.323,-Why? -Well...
00:38:46.324,00:38:52.121,"I mean, at first it was amazing, and I just wanted to keep kissing him until my lips fell off."
00:38:52.204,00:38:55.541,But then he-- he touched this spot on my lower back and...
00:38:56.042,00:38:57.418,I just... I freaked.
00:38:57.877,00:39:02.006,"And, all of a sudden, I was thinking, like, why does this hot guy want to kiss me?"
00:39:02.423,00:39:06.010,"And then I started hating myself for being that girl-- Okay, all right. Hold up."
00:39:06.844,00:39:10.014,"You know, I've had the same freaky feeling with Tim before."
00:39:10.765,00:39:12.058,-Really? -Mm-hmm.
00:39:13.142,00:39:19.023,"I mean, when he touches my stomach or a spot of acne on my chin, I clam up like a psycho."
00:39:54.141,00:39:56.811,Who memorized the steps from the link that I sent out?
00:39:56.894,00:39:59.313,"Oh, a lot of you. Okay, very good."
00:40:00.523,00:40:02.900,"Bekah, why don't you come up and demonstrate."
00:40:02.983,00:40:04.944,"And, um..."
00:40:08.989,00:40:09.824,Uh...
00:40:10.282,00:40:11.117,Ellen.
00:40:12.034,00:40:13.786,Why don't you come up here as well?
00:40:14.495,00:40:17.081,"All right, let's take it from the dance break."
00:40:17.164,00:40:17.998,Hi.
00:40:20.251,00:40:22.336,"And five, six, seven, eight."
00:40:35.015,00:40:35.891,"And hip, hip."
00:40:38.185,00:40:39.645,-They look so good. -That was awesome.
00:40:39.728,00:40:40.563,Thank you.
00:40:44.608,00:40:50.406,"All right, now, the difference between winning and losing, it's all in those details."
00:40:50.781,00:40:53.033,All right? That will serve you well in life.
00:40:53.534,00:40:54.827,"All right, you two. Uh, Ellen?"
00:40:55.995,00:40:57.705,"Why don't you stay up here, okay?"
00:40:57.788,00:40:59.248,"And the rest of us, let's try it."
00:41:16.223,00:41:18.851,"Okay, remember to smile. This is fun."
00:41:22.146,00:41:22.980,That's too sexy.
00:41:26.025,00:41:28.194,"-Elle, that was so cute! -You, too."
00:41:31.822,00:41:33.240,-I'm gonna go talk to Rosie. -Okay.
00:41:33.324,00:41:35.034,"-Bye, Elle Belle. -See you at work."
00:41:38.037,00:41:39.121,You ready to go?
00:41:40.498,00:41:43.250,-Nice moves. -I just watched the video once.
00:41:44.251,00:41:46.378,"They're easy steps, what's the big deal?"
00:41:46.462,00:41:52.218,The big deal is that you were prancing around like the perfect little pageant girl when that is the opposite of our point.
00:41:52.301,00:41:57.973,"Well, maybe there's a better way to making our point besides just trying to ruin it for everybody else."
00:41:58.057,00:41:59.725,Ruining it is the point.
00:42:00.601,00:42:04.230,You-- You just wouldn't get it 'cause you're not built for the revolution.
00:42:04.313,00:42:07.107,"-What're you trying to say? -You have to quit, Elle."
00:42:07.566,00:42:10.319,You're the kind of girl that could win this thing without even trying.
00:42:10.402,00:42:13.155,Has it occurred to you that I feel as out of place here as you do?
00:42:13.239,00:42:15.199,"Well, you looked pretty comfortable up there to me."
00:42:15.866,00:42:19.912,I can't believe you think you get to pick and choose who joins the revolution.
00:42:19.995,00:42:21.664,I thought you hated pageants.
00:42:21.747,00:42:25.376,"Well, maybe I never gave them a chance because I always listened to you."
00:42:27.253,00:42:28.337,"Okay, yeah."
00:42:28.671,00:42:33.592,Go join Coppertone Callie and live happily ever after at the store that hates fat people.
00:42:36.136,00:42:38.013,"For your information, Willowdean..."
00:42:38.889,00:42:40.724,I never thought of you as fat.
00:42:49.984,00:42:51.485,I did think of you as fat.
00:42:52.236,00:42:55.197,"You know, since we're doing, like, a truth-telling thing."
00:43:14.008,00:43:17.177,"But sometimes I'm just not quite sure she gets me, to be honest."
00:43:18.846,00:43:20.931,"That's a real shame, but you know what, honey?"
00:43:21.015,00:43:23.350,Not everybody understands what these pageants are all about.
00:43:27.646,00:43:29.189,-You know Bekah. -Hi.
00:43:29.273,00:43:30.107,"Yeah, of course."
00:43:31.984,00:43:35.195,"You know, you are so lucky that your mama is so good at..."
00:43:35.904,00:43:37.531,-just everything. -Oh...
00:43:39.199,00:43:41.827,"Dress fits you so well, it barely needs a thing."
00:43:42.453,00:43:45.748,"Uh, Dumplin', will you please hand me my extra pins over there on the desk?"
00:43:49.585,00:43:53.464,"Now, you work at Harpy's with Bo Larson, right?"
00:43:53.964,00:43:55.716,"-Uh, yeah. -Yeah?"
00:43:55.799,00:43:58.969,"Okay, so, Bo Larson is this new boy at school."
00:43:59.345,00:44:02.806,And he is such a cutie. Am I right?
00:44:32.002,00:44:32.836,Hello?
00:44:32.920,00:44:34.254,I'm at work right now.
00:44:34.797,00:44:36.131,Oh. Um...
00:44:37.216,00:44:38.050,Okay.
00:44:46.975,00:44:50.896,And so does rejecting people for things they can't change.
00:44:51.313,00:44:52.147,Elle Belle?
00:44:52.606,00:44:55.567,Can you come help me in the back with something? Thanks.
00:44:55.651,00:44:56.610,I have to go.
00:47:18.168,00:47:20.128,Should I invite the weirdos?
00:47:29.513,00:47:32.224,This feels so exciting and dangerous.
00:47:32.307,00:47:36.395,Nothing within 100 miles of Clover City warrants that type of enthusiasm.
00:47:38.438,00:47:39.731,What is this place?
00:47:39.815,00:47:42.276,"I'm gonna be honest, I've never done anything like this before."
00:47:42.359,00:47:43.193,Really?
00:47:50.117,00:47:52.244,Sh-- should we count to three?
00:47:52.786,00:47:53.745,Okay.
00:47:55.080,00:47:55.998,One...
00:47:56.874,00:47:57.791,-Two-- -Three.
00:47:58.834,00:48:00.878,"Ohh, what are we doing?"
00:48:00.961,00:48:01.962,I don't know.
00:48:03.881,00:48:04.965,IDs.
00:48:05.883,00:48:07.926,No wonder your Aunt Lucy never took you here.
00:48:08.010,00:48:08.927,It's a bar.
00:48:09.011,00:48:10.262,"Hey, hey. Lucy who?"
00:48:10.804,00:48:11.638,Uh...
00:48:11.972,00:48:13.432,Lucy Dickson.
00:48:13.515,00:48:15.684,"Oh, I knew Lucy real well."
00:48:16.143,00:48:18.186,She's... she's good people.
00:48:19.813,00:48:20.772,Come on in.
00:48:39.458,00:48:41.418,We got a table for you right over here.
00:48:53.221,00:48:54.097,Step to it.
00:48:54.181,00:48:55.098,My dear.
00:48:55.599,00:48:57.851,"Okay, now, I don't want to see you at the bar."
00:49:07.361,00:49:13.408,Holster your guns and put your hands together for our first Dolly of the night.
00:49:23.543,00:49:25.587,but that is a man.
00:49:26.296,00:49:28.674,"A very lovely man, is it not?"
00:49:32.386,00:49:33.220,Uh-huh.
00:49:33.720,00:49:34.554,Yeah.
00:50:02.874,00:50:04.751,I'm almost impressed.
00:50:18.932,00:50:20.350,He is gorgeous.
00:50:27.733,00:50:28.692,"Oh, what the fuck."
00:50:29.985,00:50:32.904,"-Fudge. I meant fudge. -Well, thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
00:50:32.988,00:50:36.616,The gods of the wigs have smiled upon us this evening.
00:50:36.700,00:50:47.461,"Back by popular demand, by some miraculous arrangement, please put those acrylics together and help us welcome Miss Rhea Ranged."
00:50:48.712,00:50:50.088,"Hi, y'all."
00:50:51.923,00:50:54.885,"Now, y'all know what Dolly said."
00:50:55.343,00:50:58.680,"It's a good thing I was born a girl, otherwise..."
00:51:01.892,00:51:03.769,Y'all are mind readers.
00:51:06.897,00:51:08.690,It's good to be home.
00:51:08.774,00:51:10.192,-Good to have you back. -Thank you.
00:51:21.161,00:51:22.412,This is my favorite song.
00:52:38.655,00:52:41.158,"-That was not what I expected. -No, I just didn't want it to end."
00:52:41.241,00:52:43.243,"Well, hello, ladies. What did you think of the show?"
00:52:43.326,00:52:45.453,I am feeling feelings I've never felt before.
00:52:45.537,00:52:48.123,"-This place'll do that to you, trust me. -That was amazing."
00:52:48.206,00:52:52.169,"Now, if you have a little minute, there's somebody backstage that'd like to say hello to you."
00:52:53.461,00:52:54.880,We'll meet you in the van.
00:52:54.963,00:52:57.132,"-Okay. -All right, then. Come on."
00:52:57.674,00:52:58.675,Come on in.
00:53:06.516,00:53:07.392,Lee.
00:53:08.518,00:53:09.436,Yeah.
00:53:11.855,00:53:12.772,Child.
00:53:13.982,00:53:20.697,"When I saw you out in that audience, I thought I was looking at the ghost of Lucy Dickson."
00:53:21.448,00:53:22.908,Bless her soul.
00:53:22.991,00:53:24.117,Oh.
00:53:27.245,00:53:31.166,"Oh, baby, your Lucy was a beauty."
00:53:31.249,00:53:32.667,Inside and out.
00:53:33.919,00:53:36.254,-I cannot get over the resemblance. -I know!
00:53:43.220,00:53:44.888,"-Come sit down. I got it, Dale. -You got it."
00:53:45.889,00:53:47.807,It's just not the same around here without her.
00:53:49.142,00:53:49.976,Ooh.
00:53:50.435,00:53:52.812,"So what brought you all the way out here, sugar?"
00:53:54.314,00:53:57.817,I think I came here tonight to somehow try and feel closer to her.
00:53:58.944,00:54:01.154,She used to help me think through everything.
00:54:02.656,00:54:05.408,And now I've got myself into something and...
00:54:06.326,00:54:07.786,"It was for her, really."
00:54:09.454,00:54:11.331,But now I don't know what I'm doing.
00:54:12.249,00:54:13.541,"Oh, it's okay."
00:54:14.960,00:54:16.670,I just wish I could talk to her.
00:54:16.753,00:54:19.005,"I do too, sugar. I do, too."
00:54:21.258,00:54:22.133,You know...
00:54:23.176,00:54:26.680,I would never have gotten up on that stage if it weren't for your Lucy.
00:54:27.389,00:54:29.557,She somehow knew that's where I belonged.
00:54:30.350,00:54:31.685,She knew it before I did.
00:54:35.939,00:54:38.108,I bet you already know what she would say.
00:54:38.191,00:54:39.109,We both do.
00:54:39.901,00:54:43.655,"Go big or go home, but either way, do it in a..."
00:54:50.078,00:54:56.001,"Now, you know, in all fairness, it took Lucy a while to get all the way there, just like it does the rest of us."
00:54:56.334,00:55:01.673,"You know that Dolly saying, Figure out who you are and do it on purpose."
00:55:04.259,00:55:06.511,Now imagine if you just jump right in it.
00:55:07.220,00:55:08.972,Ten giant steps forward.
00:55:09.472,00:55:10.473,"Mother, may I?"
00:55:10.890,00:55:11.766,Yes.
00:55:12.976,00:55:13.935,"Yes, you may."
00:55:19.566,00:55:21.860,"We are always here for you, sugar plum."
00:55:23.069,00:55:23.903,Okay?
00:55:25.947,00:55:26.990,Thank you.
00:55:28.491,00:55:30.118,Look at that face.
00:55:32.704,00:55:34.122,So beautiful.
00:55:35.623,00:55:36.499,Oh.
00:55:36.583,00:55:40.337,I listen to a lot of contemporary Christian music like Hillsong.
00:55:40.420,00:55:42.130,-What do you listen to? -Metal.
00:55:42.213,00:55:43.631,"Oh, there she is."
00:55:51.473,00:55:52.974,What happened in there?
00:55:54.642,00:55:56.144,I heard Lucy's voice.
00:55:58.480,00:55:59.522,Okay.
00:56:00.857,00:56:02.609,You know she has a cassette player?
00:56:09.407,00:56:10.450,Ladies.
00:56:10.533,00:56:18.500,"Just a reminder, final approval for talent costumes and formal wear will need to be approved by us or me."
00:56:18.583,00:56:26.299,And any changes beyond minor modifications thereafter will result in immediate disqualification.
00:56:26.883,00:56:30.136,"So save the surprises for the audience, not for the judges."
00:56:30.678,00:56:33.640,"All right, up first we've got Millie Michaelchicks."
00:56:34.391,00:56:35.809,Michaelchucks?
00:56:36.267,00:56:38.395,-Mitchellchuck. -Mitchellchuck!
00:56:55.745,00:56:57.705,"All right, um... approved."
00:56:57.789,00:56:59.707,I would just say keep working on it.
00:56:59.791,00:57:01.876,Maybe fine-tune it a little bit.
00:57:02.252,00:57:03.336,Thank you.
00:57:03.837,00:57:04.671,Next.
00:57:07.424,00:57:08.425,Look at that.
00:57:08.883,00:57:10.385,-Wow. -Looks like a cow.
00:57:18.685,00:57:22.188,"Keeping the tradition alive, bless your heart."
00:57:22.272,00:57:23.982,"Approved, approved."
00:57:24.065,00:57:25.775,"Up next, Hannah Perez."
00:57:27.819,00:57:28.987,"Oh, God."
00:57:30.363,00:57:33.616,"Hey, hey, ho, ho, patriarchy has got to go!"
00:57:33.700,00:57:37.370,"Hey, hey, ho, ho, patriarchy has got to go!"
00:57:42.625,00:57:44.169,"I'm... I mean, is that it?"
00:57:44.878,00:57:46.546,No... no music?
00:57:46.629,00:57:50.592,"Well, I... I can't approve that because, technically, that's not a talent."
00:57:56.764,00:57:58.099,"Next up, Bekah Colter."
00:58:07.650,00:58:08.485,Ow.
00:58:12.530,00:58:13.823,Can I try one more time?
00:58:16.868,00:58:17.827,Whoo!
00:58:29.380,00:58:30.798,Approved.
00:58:30.882,00:58:32.592,"Okay, approved."
00:58:33.343,00:58:34.260,Approved.
00:58:36.429,00:58:37.472,Approved.
00:58:38.223,00:58:39.057,"Oh, sorry."
00:58:39.390,00:58:41.976,I won with that back in '91. I got so excited.
00:58:42.352,00:58:43.269,So good.
00:58:44.437,00:58:46.981,"All right, last up, Willowdean Dickson."
00:59:04.541,00:59:05.667,Okay.
00:59:08.419,00:59:14.467,"In my hand here, I have a regular glass bottle, which I drank out of earlier today."
00:59:16.261,00:59:19.973,"And in this hand, I have a regular quarter."
00:59:21.432,00:59:22.350,See?
00:59:23.142,00:59:24.936,"Now, I will magically..."
00:59:25.353,00:59:29.023,attempt to get the quarter through the bottle.
00:59:32.694,00:59:33.695,Here we go.
00:59:48.835,00:59:50.128,To the left.
01:00:05.518,01:00:06.352,Ta-da.
01:00:15.737,01:00:16.779,I'll practice more.
01:00:18.072,01:00:18.948,Promise.
01:00:26.372,01:00:27.206,Approved.
01:00:27.749,01:00:30.126,Based solely on that assurance.
01:00:39.135,01:00:45.767,"Well, that certainly was a surprise, and the one free pass you were not supposed to get from me."
01:00:48.728,01:00:51.731,"Dumplin', I don't understand. Why are you doing this?"
01:01:43.825,01:01:45.118,Table nine needs waters.
01:01:54.669,01:01:56.295,I think so. Maybe.
01:01:56.921,01:01:57.755,"Oh, hey."
01:01:58.798,01:01:59.716,Hi.
01:01:59.799,01:02:01.759,Am I gonna see you at pageant practice today?
01:02:02.677,01:02:03.511,Um...
01:02:04.053,01:02:05.263,"No, I got to work."
01:02:21.863,01:02:23.364,Have you guys decided what you want?
01:02:37.253,01:02:38.254,Everything okay?
01:02:43.551,01:02:44.427,Yeah.
01:02:48.181,01:02:51.684,I think that's the first time I've ever heard you give a one-word answer to anything.
01:02:54.687,01:02:56.105,"All right, look."
01:02:57.273,01:02:59.859,"You've been kind of hard to pin down, so I'm just gonna tell you."
01:03:01.819,01:03:02.820,"I like you, Will."
01:03:06.491,01:03:07.325,Why?
01:03:09.035,01:03:10.036,Why what?
01:03:10.995,01:03:11.913,What about Bekah?
01:03:13.206,01:03:14.123,Bekah?
01:03:15.124,01:03:16.000,What about Bekah?
01:03:16.083,01:03:17.960,She asked me to a dance? That's it.
01:03:18.044,01:03:20.296,And I didn't go. I don't like Bekah like that.
01:03:20.671,01:03:21.547,I don't...
01:03:21.839,01:03:23.257,I-I don't understand.
01:03:24.342,01:03:25.176,Well...
01:03:26.219,01:03:27.261,-It's pretty simple. -No.
01:03:27.345,01:03:29.222,"No, it's not, 'cause you and I..."
01:03:29.430,01:03:31.808,"we don't work together in the real world, Bo."
01:03:31.891,01:03:34.143,You're supposed to be with someone like Bekah.
01:03:35.102,01:03:36.687,What are you talking about?
01:03:36.771,01:03:37.814,"Oh, my God."
01:03:38.397,01:03:40.233,I'm talking about this.
01:03:41.359,01:03:43.069,How are you missing this?
01:03:43.152,01:03:45.822,Do you not know what it would be like to be with me?
01:03:45.905,01:03:48.407,Never took you for the type that cares much what people think.
01:03:48.491,01:03:49.492,"I can't, Bo."
01:03:50.326,01:03:52.703,"-And that might make me a coward, but I-- -It does."
01:03:55.581,01:03:56.749,Willowdean Dickson.
01:03:58.334,01:03:59.710,I think you're beautiful.
01:04:01.587,01:04:05.383,To hell with anyone else who's ever made you feel less than that.
01:04:13.224,01:04:15.184,"Doesn't really matter what I think, does it?"
01:04:29.782,01:04:30.616,Mmm.
01:04:32.285,01:04:34.036,"Yeah. Let's try it again. Come on, come on."
01:04:34.120,01:04:36.289,-Let's try it one more time. -Okay. Okay. Okay.
01:04:36.372,01:04:38.833,One foot in front of the other sets the ocean in motion.
01:04:40.751,01:04:41.919,"There you go, girl. That's it."
01:04:43.671,01:04:45.256,You told us to meet you here.
01:04:46.048,01:04:47.466,Answer your damn phone.
01:07:13.279,01:07:14.405,Willowdean...
01:08:13.255,01:08:14.298,I'm not prepared.
01:08:16.509,01:08:18.427,This is gonna be a total disaster.
01:08:48.207,01:08:50.417,"Welcome back to The Hideaway, girls."
01:08:54.046,01:08:55.631,We'll find something else here.
01:08:55.714,01:09:00.553,"All right, my little ladybugs, are you ready to find out what it takes to be a real pageant queen?"
01:09:03.139,01:09:05.641,"-It's just a muumuu, right? -Would you put those down?"
01:09:05.724,01:09:07.101,This muumuu has a slit.
01:09:13.983,01:09:16.569,"Oh, yes. Yes."
01:09:19.446,01:09:20.656,Yes.
01:09:21.157,01:09:22.867,"Fashion diva, no."
01:09:22.950,01:09:24.076,What about these?
01:09:26.036,01:09:26.871,No.
01:09:27.913,01:09:29.165,If you're gonna do it...
01:09:29.582,01:09:32.459,you do it in a red pair of shoes.
01:09:40.885,01:09:42.011,I love it!
01:09:42.636,01:09:44.346,"-Don't smile, you'll get wrinkles. -Ew."
01:09:51.103,01:09:52.271,Yes!
01:10:01.405,01:10:03.073,"Oh, wow."
01:10:03.949,01:10:05.284,That's awesome.
01:10:07.745,01:10:08.746,I like those.
01:10:09.205,01:10:11.624,Remember that all things are not as they seem.
01:10:12.291,01:10:13.292,And pull.
01:10:14.210,01:10:15.252,Pull.
01:10:15.336,01:10:17.004,Don't be afraid of it. There you go.
01:10:25.930,01:10:26.889,Okay.
01:10:27.556,01:10:29.058,"-No, it's not okay. -Okay."
01:10:29.141,01:10:32.311,"Number one, chin up. Ain't nothing down there but just a penny."
01:10:32.394,01:10:34.813,"One, two, three, slap your skirt."
01:10:34.897,01:10:36.065,"-Yes, queen. -Slap."
01:10:36.148,01:10:37.358,My mom is gonna hate it.
01:10:38.442,01:10:40.736,"One, two, yes, girls."
01:10:40.819,01:10:42.529,"Five, six, seven."
01:10:42.613,01:10:44.406,"You gonna work on it. Yes, girl."
01:10:44.490,01:10:46.367,"-I have a suggestion. -Oh, come on. Come on."
01:10:46.450,01:10:49.787,"If you shake your ta-tas, you will hear the ra-ras, okay?"
01:10:54.833,01:10:56.126,"Hey, be careful now."
01:10:56.210,01:10:59.380,"Two, three, four, five, six. Go, girl!"
01:10:59.797,01:11:00.631,Rock...
01:11:00.714,01:11:01.757,that...
01:11:02.341,01:11:03.300,auditorium.
01:11:05.427,01:11:07.930,"So, what do you see for me?"
01:11:09.390,01:11:10.933,I see a fitted bodice.
01:11:11.600,01:11:13.644,Sequins flowing down to the ground.
01:11:14.353,01:11:19.608,"As you walk, a feathered collar is lifted by a mystical breeze."
01:11:21.735,01:11:23.862,"You got to see it in here first, baby girl."
01:11:26.073,01:11:26.949,Here.
01:11:29.660,01:11:30.494,Okay.
01:12:14.788,01:12:20.753,"Well, I told Lee I needed my wardrobe by noon, and he said, I'm a designer, sugar plum, not a magician."
01:12:20.836,01:12:23.172,But everybody's been approved except for you.
01:12:23.672,01:12:25.215,I had to bring backups.
01:12:25.632,01:12:30.846,"Okay, so, remember, speak clearly 'cause you never get a second chance at a first impression."
01:12:30.929,01:12:33.515,Be brief 'cause it shows a sign of confidence.
01:12:33.599,01:12:36.477,And avoid using like and um 'cause it makes us sound ignorant.
01:12:36.560,01:12:40.356,And speak from experience 'cause it shows you've lived a life worth paying attention to.
01:12:43.192,01:12:45.694,"Oh, public speaking makes me want to barf."
01:12:46.070,01:12:46.904,Okay.
01:12:47.237,01:12:48.697,"Come on, tough guy."
01:12:54.745,01:12:55.788,Hello?
01:12:56.163,01:13:00.876,"Good morning, girls, and welcome to the preliminary event."
01:13:01.418,01:13:06.215,I would like to introduce to you your esteemed panel of judges.
01:13:06.298,01:13:19.895,"Miss Tabitha Herrera from Tabitha Salons, And Mr. Clay Dooley of Clay Dooley Chevy, where value meets quality."
01:13:21.688,01:13:23.357,And Burgundy Herrer.
01:13:23.440,01:13:29.655,"Once a Miss Teen herself, who now graces the halls of Century 21."
01:13:33.117,01:13:40.958,So I will hand it over now to our judges who will be randomly selecting names and questions for our contestants.
01:13:41.458,01:13:42.334,Thank you.
01:13:46.547,01:13:48.382,Miss Willowdean Dickson.
01:14:12.865,01:14:15.075,How would you define loyalty?
01:14:18.579,01:14:19.413,Um...
01:14:20.372,01:14:21.540,Loyalty.
01:14:26.837,01:14:31.800,"Loyalty means never giving up on someone, even through doubts and differences."
01:14:32.217,01:14:33.510,It's a noun...
01:14:34.303,01:14:44.480,"with action, fueled by shared experiences, which are memorable, meaningful, and irreplaceable."
01:14:47.024,01:14:48.650,But loyalty isn't blind love.
01:14:50.694,01:14:52.404,It shouldn't be taken for granted.
01:14:53.572,01:14:57.993,Loyalty means telling someone when they're wrong when no one else will.
01:14:59.453,01:15:05.751,"And loyalty means apologizing when you're wrong, because of the trust you've built over time."
01:15:12.341,01:15:14.051,Loyalty is true friendship.
01:15:20.349,01:15:21.683,"Thank you, Miss Dickson."
01:15:31.527,01:15:34.238,"Ladies, please find the station with your name on it."
01:15:38.492,01:15:40.410,"If you have any questions, I'm here to help."
01:15:50.837,01:15:51.922,It's just a word.
01:15:52.548,01:15:55.008,"It doesn't mean anything unless you let it, but..."
01:15:55.968,01:15:57.719,"if it hurts you, it hurts me."
01:15:58.554,01:15:59.596,I'm sorry.
01:15:59.680,01:16:00.639,Me too.
01:16:01.139,01:16:03.684,I was wrong to think you weren't built for the revolution.
01:16:03.767,01:16:04.810,Damn straight.
01:16:04.893,01:16:07.312,This booty can do more damage than you think.
01:16:13.610,01:16:15.070,I missed you.
01:16:15.153,01:16:16.989,"Oh, and I missed you, too."
01:16:17.823,01:16:21.034,I'm sorry. I really do want to stop judging.
01:16:22.035,01:16:24.371,I promise. I just...
01:16:25.664,01:16:27.499,I know everyone has their own story.
01:16:28.250,01:16:29.793,Even Callie.
01:16:30.085,01:16:34.965,"And if you guys wanna be friends, I understand-- Okay. Willowdean Opal Dickson."
01:16:35.549,01:16:39.136,"You are my best friend, and you always will be."
01:16:40.887,01:16:43.557,"You're not still doing that sketchy water bottle trick, are you?"
01:16:43.640,01:16:46.435,"Hey, I have a few tricks up my sleeve."
01:16:47.102,01:16:50.689,"Although, I sure could use your help in pulling them off."
01:16:50.772,01:16:54.901,"-Well, viva la revolucion, baby. -Oh, I missed you!"
01:16:54.985,01:16:55.944,I missed you!
01:17:09.499,01:17:11.501,the 85th annual Miss Teen Bluebonnet pageant.
01:17:11.585,01:17:13.378,Who is gonna be crowned this year's winner?
01:17:13.462,01:17:15.839,"I'll be your host, Eugene Reed. See you tonight."
01:17:16.131,01:17:17.966,-Bye. -Bye.
01:17:18.050,01:17:19.593,See you later at the show.
01:17:19.968,01:17:21.219,Okay. Bye.
01:17:27.517,01:17:28.560,Hi.
01:17:37.778,01:17:39.154,Is everything okay?
01:17:41.740,01:17:42.866,"Well, you were right."
01:17:44.910,01:17:46.370,I never really got to know...
01:17:47.412,01:17:48.664,all of who she was.
01:17:53.126,01:17:54.836,I don't-- I don't understand this.
01:18:00.300,01:18:02.969,"I mean, Lucy was the most confident."
01:18:06.098,01:18:07.057,Her confidence...
01:18:07.724,01:18:08.767,scared me.
01:18:10.143,01:18:11.478,I just can't imagine...
01:18:12.938,01:18:15.065,her to want to do something and not do it.
01:18:20.237,01:18:21.154,Oh...
01:18:22.447,01:18:23.740,But the dress.
01:18:26.201,01:18:29.788,"The year that I won the pageant, we didn't have any money..."
01:18:30.539,01:18:31.873,to get me a new dress.
01:18:32.999,01:18:33.959,So Lucy...
01:18:34.835,01:18:38.880,"helped me find one, very last minute, at the thrift store."
01:18:38.964,01:18:40.966,And she...
01:18:41.466,01:18:43.844,just insisted...
01:18:44.720,01:18:49.808,"on staying up all night to work on it, even though I told her, I said, It's fine."
01:18:50.350,01:18:52.185,It's fine. It fits fine.
01:18:52.644,01:18:55.313,No one's gonna notice a few missing sequins.
01:18:56.314,01:18:57.357,I said that.
01:19:02.738,01:19:03.905,And the next morning...
01:19:04.865,01:19:09.953,"when she handed it back to me, she said, In life..."
01:19:11.204,01:19:13.582,the difference between winning and losing...
01:19:15.333,01:19:16.585,is all in the details.
01:19:20.505,01:19:21.673,That was her.
01:19:26.553,01:19:27.888,Lucy taught me that.
01:19:30.974,01:19:32.726,You never told me that before.
01:19:40.442,01:19:41.401,Where are they?
01:19:43.570,01:19:44.529,They?
01:19:46.448,01:19:49.117,Her-- the boxes. Lucy's boxes. Where are they?
01:19:49.576,01:19:50.535,Oh...
01:19:52.245,01:19:54.456,Well... I donated 'em.
01:20:04.174,01:20:05.008,Oh.
01:20:05.258,01:20:07.385,I think I gave too much of her away.
01:20:15.101,01:20:15.977,Ooh.
01:20:26.947,01:20:27.823,Mom?
01:20:36.957,01:20:40.585,"Costumes, hats, boots. Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
01:20:47.467,01:20:50.595,Millicent Amethyst Mitchellchuck!
01:20:53.348,01:20:54.349,What's up?
01:20:54.432,01:20:55.684,I'm not sure.
01:20:55.976,01:20:56.977,Oh.
01:20:59.938,01:21:02.440,You lied to me? You just lied?
01:21:02.524,01:21:04.568,You lied straight to my face?
01:21:04.943,01:21:06.570,You-- Needlepoint Club?
01:21:06.653,01:21:07.571,Sorry.
01:21:07.654,01:21:08.989,Is this who you are?
01:21:13.493,01:21:14.911,-But... -What?
01:21:14.995,01:21:17.914,You were wrong for saying no when I asked.
01:21:18.623,01:21:24.212,"I get that you were just trying to protect me, but sometimes I need you to support me."
01:21:24.296,01:21:28.967,"All right, well, that is private, and we will discuss that in the car on the way home."
01:21:29.384,01:21:30.927,"No, Mrs. Mitchellchuck?"
01:21:31.219,01:21:32.053,Um...
01:21:32.137,01:21:33.388,Millie has to compete.
01:21:34.139,01:21:36.975,She's worked so hard for this and she really deserves it.
01:21:37.434,01:21:38.810,She's not fragile.
01:21:39.352,01:21:41.938,She's got this thick skin you wouldn't even expect.
01:21:42.898,01:21:46.818,And you know she's been dreaming of doing the pageant since she was eight years old.
01:21:48.069,01:21:49.029,Is that true?
01:21:51.531,01:21:54.910,There's nothing in the rules that says big girls need not apply.
01:22:04.044,01:22:05.795,I have one thing to say to you.
01:22:14.429,01:22:15.639,How much wood...
01:22:17.098,01:22:18.975,could a Mitchellchuck chuck...
01:22:19.976,01:22:22.354,if a Mitchellchuck could chuck wood?
01:22:23.855,01:22:28.944,As much wood as a Mitchellchuck could chuck if a Mitchellchuck could chuck wood.
01:22:32.489,01:22:35.158,"I'm sorry, but you can't lie to me. You just cannot."
01:22:38.036,01:22:38.995,"Yes, it's a yes."
01:22:40.997,01:22:41.915,Come on.
01:22:42.791,01:22:43.667,A question.
01:22:44.292,01:22:46.211,Who the heck did your hair and makeup?
01:22:46.294,01:22:48.254,"Oh, it's a long story, Mom."
01:22:59.224,01:23:04.145,to welcome you to Clover City's 85th annual Miss Teen Bluebonnet pageant.
01:23:04.229,01:23:07.273,Please put your hands together for this year's contestants.
01:23:23.873,01:23:24.791,That was nice.
01:24:20.055,01:24:24.476,"And let's get a round of applause for these lovely, beautiful, coordinated contestants."
01:24:24.976,01:24:31.900,"Let's give it up to Miss Rosie Dickson and her beautiful homage to this year's theme: Texas, ain't she grand?"
01:24:33.193,01:24:35.153,"She is grand, Rosie, and so are you."
01:24:35.236,01:24:37.155,And a good kisser. Hah! Just kidding.
01:24:37.781,01:24:38.615,Ain't she?
01:24:38.948,01:24:40.658,"Yes, she is. Once again..."
01:24:41.076,01:24:43.161,"Okay, girls. Lifestyle and fitness."
01:24:43.244,01:24:44.412,Let's take our places.
01:24:44.662,01:24:47.373,"Make sure your tapes are in the right places, ladies."
01:24:57.342,01:25:01.179,"And now, on to our next event, health and fitness."
01:25:01.262,01:25:04.224,Please welcome Miss Bekah Colter.
01:25:12.732,01:25:19.531,"Okay. In 1971, Dolly's seventh single as a solo artist, written the same year as Nickels and Dimes."
01:25:20.406,01:25:21.241,Mmm-mmm.
01:25:21.783,01:25:23.952,"It's All Wrong, But It's All Right."
01:25:24.369,01:25:25.620,Now let's do this.
01:25:38.133,01:25:41.052,"Oh, and along with Miss Ellen Dryver."
01:25:41.511,01:25:44.430,"I'm not quite sure what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen."
01:25:58.653,01:26:00.655,Yes. Yes.
01:26:06.953,01:26:08.329,but the crowd sure loves it.
01:26:20.925,01:26:22.802,Weren't those girls amazing?
01:26:24.637,01:26:27.223,"And now, Miss Hannah Perez."
01:26:27.307,01:26:30.685,"Just so we're clear, I'm doing this for me, not for them."
01:26:31.769,01:26:32.937,"You go, girl."
01:27:12.477,01:27:13.978,That's my daughter. What?
01:27:14.896,01:27:16.189,-That's yours? -Uh-huh.
01:27:17.607,01:27:18.691,That's her daughter.
01:27:18.775,01:27:20.151,-What? -That's Millie's mom.
01:27:24.239,01:27:26.574,"and her special guest, Miss Precious."
01:27:26.658,01:27:30.870,"It's all in the wrist. Sweep, sweep, swipe, swipe, swipe."
01:27:31.204,01:27:32.163,Bless her heart.
01:27:32.580,01:27:33.539,You're a natural.
01:27:40.546,01:27:42.840,Our next talent contestant will be...
01:27:42.924,01:27:46.803,"Miss Willowdean Dickson, here to delight you with a magic trick."
01:27:47.220,01:27:48.096,Watch this.
01:28:40.690,01:28:41.607,"Oh, my."
01:29:11.054,01:29:12.347,How did she do it?
01:29:12.430,01:29:13.723,It's so neat.
01:29:25.651,01:29:26.569,I like it.
01:29:33.576,01:29:34.410,Yeah!
01:29:47.298,01:29:48.216,"Oh, God."
01:29:49.258,01:29:50.218,"Oh, my God."
01:30:02.855,01:30:04.899,"Oh, my God, she did so good."
01:30:05.274,01:30:06.984,Oh. Oh.
01:30:09.028,01:30:10.988,for that mesmerizing magic act.
01:30:13.032,01:30:15.284,-That was amazing. -I feel like I gave birth.
01:30:16.744,01:30:24.419,"Our next talent contestant will be Miss Millicent Mitchellchuck, singing High and Mighty for you this evening."
01:31:10.506,01:31:13.259,"Willowdean, Miss Dickson wants you in her dressing room."
01:32:19.116,01:32:20.159,I can't believe it!
01:32:20.910,01:32:22.245,I can't believe I did it.
01:32:22.328,01:32:24.121,"It was so good, it was so good."
01:32:24.205,01:32:27.333,"-Really? Oh, man, that was incredible. -Really. It was so good."
01:32:31.712,01:32:32.588,Come in.
01:32:42.807,01:32:43.641,Wow.
01:32:44.850,01:32:45.726,That was...
01:32:46.644,01:32:48.396,That was truly a surprise.
01:32:51.065,01:32:51.941,Thanks.
01:32:54.527,01:32:56.696,I'm so proud.
01:32:59.198,01:33:00.992,Lucy would've been so proud.
01:33:05.288,01:33:09.667,"But my talent wardrobe was not approved, nor was my song."
01:33:10.126,01:33:13.713,"And, full disclosure, neither was the formal I was about to put on."
01:33:15.047,01:33:17.300,"Technicalities, but..."
01:33:17.383,01:33:23.764,"Any changes made beyond minor modifications after approvals will result in immediate disqualification, I know."
01:33:25.600,01:33:26.642,Preparation.
01:33:27.143,01:33:28.269,It's key.
01:33:29.854,01:33:32.773,"Can I just do the final walk? Not to compete, just to finish?"
01:33:32.857,01:33:33.733,No.
01:33:34.358,01:33:35.860,I wish I could.
01:33:35.943,01:33:39.322,"I wish I could, honey, but that wouldn't be fair to the other girls."
01:33:39.405,01:33:41.574,Me making an exception for my daughter?
01:33:42.950,01:33:44.368,"I'm sorry, Dumplin'."
01:33:44.952,01:33:46.162,"Oh, shoot!"
01:33:47.330,01:33:50.207,And you hate it when I call you that. I will-- I'm sorry.
01:33:50.291,01:33:53.044,"-Mom. -I will try, I promise."
01:33:53.127,01:33:54.337,It's fine.
01:33:55.004,01:33:56.130,It's just a word.
01:33:57.548,01:33:58.799,I am Dumplin'.
01:33:59.091,01:34:00.676,-Will... -I am Will.
01:34:01.260,01:34:04.013,"I am Willowdean, I'm-- I'm a beauty queen."
01:34:04.221,01:34:05.890,I'm disqualified.
01:34:06.098,01:34:07.099,I'm all of it.
01:34:11.354,01:34:13.981,Tim is stuck in the bathroom with food poisoning.
01:34:14.065,01:34:16.192,My escort is green. I don't know what I'm going to do.
01:34:16.275,01:34:18.069,"Well, I'm disqualified, so you can take mine."
01:34:18.152,01:34:19.987,He's sitting near the front with the drag queen.
01:34:20.071,01:34:21.864,"-Wait, what? -Disqualified?"
01:34:21.947,01:34:24.158,Then I'm out too. I'm not doing this without you.
01:34:26.702,01:34:27.536,"Wait, wait."
01:34:28.412,01:34:29.246,Okay.
01:34:30.331,01:34:34.043,Nowhere in the bylaws does it say that a...
01:34:34.627,01:34:39.298,disqualified contestant cannot escort a fellow contestant.
01:34:40.549,01:34:41.425,Right?
01:34:42.385,01:34:44.553,"Okay, I'll go tell Tim. He'll be so relieved."
01:34:44.637,01:34:45.638,Okay.
01:34:46.305,01:34:48.641,"Oh, wait! Honey, will you please zip me before you go?"
01:34:48.724,01:34:49.558,Mm-hmm.
01:34:50.267,01:34:51.644,-Okay. -Okay.
01:34:55.022,01:34:57.149,"-Okay, pull down. -Okay. Pull down."
01:35:01.487,01:35:03.906,"-Maybe. -Oh, no. What is happening?"
01:35:03.989,01:35:05.032,"Uh, well..."
01:35:07.535,01:35:08.369,-What? -Mom...
01:35:08.452,01:35:09.412,"What, what?"
01:35:09.954,01:35:11.372,-That's as far as it goes. -No.
01:35:11.455,01:35:13.499,"-Yeah. -No, uh-uh. No, no. Come on."
01:35:13.916,01:35:15.209,"Oh, gosh."
01:35:15.751,01:35:16.752,-No. -No?
01:35:16.836,01:35:17.878,-No. -No!
01:35:18.838,01:35:19.714,"Oh, no."
01:35:20.506,01:35:22.591,"Oh, no! Oh, no."
01:35:22.800,01:35:24.635,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
01:35:24.719,01:35:25.553,No.
01:35:26.303,01:35:27.722,I have to wear this dress.
01:35:28.639,01:35:29.765,It's tradition.
01:35:31.559,01:35:32.518,"Oh, God."
01:35:34.437,01:35:35.980,I did not bring a backup.
01:35:39.817,01:35:40.651,I have an idea.
01:35:40.735,01:35:43.362,"I'm-- I'm just gonna be five minutes, but you have to trust me."
