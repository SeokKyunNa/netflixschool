00:00:28.987,00:00:32.240,That's pretty scary. So what was telling you you were dying?
00:00:49.966,00:00:51.384,"All right, here we go."
00:00:52.135,00:00:53.428,Are you ready for a high flyer?
00:00:55.180,00:00:57.515,because the... the straw's really slippery.
00:01:07.275,00:01:09.277,"Oh, you're such a heavy big girl."
00:01:22.082,00:01:24.000,I've always wanted to be in the movies.
00:01:33.802,00:01:34.928,Don't move.
00:01:59.869,00:02:01.454,is too much to bear.
00:02:02.205,00:02:03.581,He's my dad.
00:02:05.708,00:02:10.171,"He's such an open, accepting person. That's who you want for a father."
00:02:10.255,00:02:14.300,"And that's who I have. Who I've always had, my whole life."
00:02:14.384,00:02:15.718,Oh!
00:02:17.846,00:02:19.430,Whoa!
00:02:23.935,00:02:26.146,The beginning of his disappearance.
00:02:27.021,00:02:28.565,And we're not accepting it.
00:02:31.192,00:02:34.696,He's a psychiatrist. I'm a cameraperson.
00:02:34.779,00:02:37.699,I suggested we make a movie about him dying.
00:02:39.993,00:02:41.119,He said yes.
00:03:41.429,00:03:42.263,All right.
00:03:43.306,00:03:44.682,So we're gonna get a stool.
00:03:48.937,00:03:50.521,"It's pretty narrow, right?"
00:03:50.605,00:03:52.357,Yeah. How much did that cost ya?
00:03:52.440,00:03:54.400,"Maureen, how much did this cost us?"
00:03:54.484,00:03:57.278,"Uh, 666 bucks."
00:04:02.325,00:04:03.534,-I may never get out. -I got your legs.
00:04:13.670,00:04:15.255,Is it cozy in there?
00:04:23.304,00:04:25.223,"Ray, come look at the hand positions too."
00:04:29.102,00:04:33.189,It is so weird to see your buddy in a coffin.
00:04:33.273,00:04:35.400,This is not good for me.
00:04:37.527,00:04:46.119,"But this is a movie, and I keep reminding myself that this is a movie, and you see a lot of weird stuff in movies that never happen."
00:04:53.459,00:04:54.544,Mmm.
00:05:03.720,00:05:05.430,"Uh, he's still breathing."
00:05:08.558,00:05:09.767,"That's the trick, right?"
00:05:10.727,00:05:11.728,Now he's asleep.
00:05:28.953,00:05:32.123,"Hey, it's nice to be back, you know."
00:05:35.710,00:05:39.756,I think what you're doing is not completely a fantasy.
00:05:39.839,00:05:48.806,"I think, in a sense, it causes a lot of serious questioning, and... and everybody has to sort of prepare."
00:05:48.890,00:05:54.896,"Because everybody dies, and to that extent, I don't put this in a fantasy group."
00:06:07.241,00:06:10.995,I'm good at running over with a car.
00:06:11.079,00:06:15.374,"You know, I'm the bum you grab from the street -and throw in front of a bus. -Yeah."
00:06:15.458,00:06:17.668,I'm the guy you whip the hell out of.
00:06:17.752,00:06:18.961,Do you love what you do?
00:06:22.507,00:06:23.883,In terms of stunts? Or...
00:06:23.966,00:06:28.012,"Yeah. Well, being a stuntman, you know?"
00:06:28.096,00:06:30.181,I would say I love...
00:06:31.474,00:06:35.645,"-the, um... the world of cinema. -Okay."
00:06:35.728,00:06:39.315,"And the bigger and grander, uh..."
00:06:40.399,00:06:43.361,"and the more creative it is, the more I love it."
00:06:54.455,00:06:55.373,You know.
00:06:55.456,00:07:00.419,"I would have him go over in the chair, 'cause that would kinda sell it. The legs go up, you know?"
00:07:04.882,00:07:06.092,No one gets hurt.
00:07:07.927,00:07:12.140,"I have. I have. I've had, I think, one or two suicides."
00:07:15.226,00:07:19.814,"In fact, there's been quite a few stuntpeople that have... have committed suicide."
00:07:20.857,00:07:23.526,"So, uh, whenever you feel suicidal, talk to me."
00:07:28.739,00:07:30.116,And it can be as violent as you want.
00:07:37.748,00:07:40.710,And then what'd be nice is you could... Your chair could...
00:07:40.793,00:07:42.003,Tip over? Yeah.
00:07:55.725,00:07:58.436,I guess what I'm trying to figure out too is does this appeal to you?
00:07:58.519,00:08:06.027,"This idea that your daughter has suggested, you know, to sort of sit back and watch Dick Johnson..."
00:08:09.614,00:08:11.699,"Sure. Oh, this'll be great, you know?"
00:08:47.276,00:08:50.279,Wow. That was me? That hurt.
00:08:57.495,00:08:59.330,"Oh, I think the heart attack."
00:08:59.413,00:09:01.082,-It hurt? The heart attack? -Yeah.
00:09:01.165,00:09:02.333,-Really? -Yeah.
00:09:02.416,00:09:03.292,I didn't know that.
00:09:04.669,00:09:06.629,It was part... It hurt in your heart?
00:09:06.712,00:09:09.507,"Yeah. And, you know, the whole thing put together."
00:09:09.590,00:09:11.884,-The... The initial thing... -Mm-hmm.
00:09:11.968,00:09:27.483,"Not getting air, not getting breath, lying down, and taking me to the home and having pain, and then going to the emergency room and arresting, and the whole scenario. Not one part of it, but the whole thing."
00:09:29.902,00:09:31.195,I'm glad I survived. Yeah.
00:09:33.155,00:09:35.825,Yeah. And lived to live how many more years?
00:09:36.993,00:09:41.289,"1987... That's 20 years, isn't it?"
00:09:41.998,00:09:50.131,"-Mmm... it's even more than that. -Is it? Seven-- -You got to live an extra 30 years. -That's pretty good, yeah."
00:09:51.549,00:09:53.301,Probably the best years of my life.
00:10:01.183,00:10:02.643,Where did I get this from?
00:10:20.911,00:10:22.496,It's fighting for its life.
00:10:31.547,00:10:33.257,That's Grandma Walder.
00:10:33.341,00:10:36.719,Already... Your grandma already died?
00:10:40.473,00:10:42.600,-When I was-- -You were a little baby?
00:10:47.229,00:10:49.774,And when I was a teenage boy...
00:11:03.412,00:11:05.247,But does anyone remember what her name is?
00:11:34.693,00:11:38.406,They've been a source of embarrassment to me for my entire life.
00:11:45.037,00:11:50.000,"When she bore me and saw those toes, she cried and cried and cried."
00:12:17.528,00:12:24.577,I suspect she may have misjudged and thought she was down before she was down.
00:12:24.660,00:12:27.580,-Yeah. -And stepped into nothing.
00:12:31.750,00:12:34.086,-That was where the brutality started. -Yeah.
00:14:15.813,00:14:18.732,"like, your arm that's closest to the wall, in some weird..."
00:14:20.025,00:14:21.151,"Yeah, that's nice."
00:14:22.778,00:14:24.697,Okay. Ready?
00:14:25.573,00:14:30.995,"And... action. Keep smiling, Dad. Keep smiling."
00:14:31.078,00:14:33.205,"Yeah. Perfect, I think we got it."
00:14:35.833,00:14:38.502,"That was really nice jumping, Bruce."
00:14:41.171,00:14:44.842,My parents brought us up in the Seventh-Day Adventist religion.
00:14:44.925,00:14:46.677,That's how they were raised.
00:14:46.760,00:14:50.598,"Like any religion, it offers answers to our questions about death."
00:14:52.683,00:14:55.394,Adventism promises heaven for the righteous.
00:14:55.477,00:14:58.772,"But also, it tells us that nobody's up in heaven yet."
00:14:59.398,00:15:04.445,"The dead have to wait in their graves. They're unconscious, in a kind of sleep."
00:15:07.323,00:15:15.164,Only when Jesus returns to earth for the Day of Judgment will believers be resurrected and rise up to heaven to live forever.
00:15:16.248,00:15:17.708,"And drop, Dad."
00:15:21.128,00:15:24.465,"As we practiced it, Adventism was a strict religion."
00:15:24.548,00:15:27.676,"No alcohol, no dancing, no movies."
00:15:28.510,00:15:30.888,And I tried hard not to break a single rule.
00:15:32.139,00:15:37.728,"But when I was 11, my dad took my brother and me to see Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein."
00:15:38.938,00:15:42.316,I was scandalized. And I loved it.
00:15:43.150,00:15:46.528,"Dad loved it, too. He had a way of living in the moment."
00:15:47.363,00:15:51.533,"I've got my heaven, he would say. Right here on earth. With all of you."
00:16:25.859,00:16:28.904,She kills me. Multiple times.
00:16:30.364,00:16:33.409,And I come back to life. It's Groundhog Day all over again.
00:16:33.492,00:16:35.160,-The resurrected dad. -Yeah.
00:16:39.415,00:16:41.166,"It's not easy dying though, let me tell you."
00:16:41.250,00:16:43.585,"No. When she told me that part, I went, Oh, no."
00:16:43.669,00:16:46.588,"But she said you was coming back, I was like, All right. That's awesome."
00:17:00.853,00:17:03.564,"And he couldn't swim, and, you know, that was it."
00:17:06.567,00:17:08.986,"That's terrible, to lose a father at that age."
00:17:09.069,00:17:11.238,"Yeah. Mom was a strong woman, though."
00:17:11.321,00:17:12.948,"You know, she raised us."
00:17:14.575,00:17:15.784,...the right hand caught us.
00:17:19.246,00:17:20.622,How long ago?
00:17:27.546,00:17:31.425,"Mmm-hmm. But she had Alzheimer's, so it was a long goodbye."
00:17:34.887,00:17:39.767,We lost her several years before she actually passed.
00:17:42.603,00:17:43.479,Yeah.
00:17:45.314,00:17:46.231,Um...
00:17:48.233,00:17:49.234,Wow.
00:17:50.194,00:17:51.612,I don't know. I guess...
00:17:52.112,00:17:55.532,"some people say I just look serious all the time, you know, but..."
00:17:55.616,00:17:57.076,I don't know. I don't know.
00:17:57.659,00:18:00.370,"I'm a man of peace, you know."
00:18:03.624,00:18:05.501,"...all this is clear, I can start breaking this down."
00:18:05.584,00:18:09.671,"I can be out of here in about five, ten minutes, and I just lay it down neatly on the floor."
00:18:16.929,00:18:21.350,"We're leaving all of this, it's such a good-looking space, but we're doing it. We're doing it."
00:18:21.433,00:18:24.978,"Better not leave nothing in here, 'cause I'll take it home. They call me Fred Sanford."
00:18:43.539,00:19:08.856,"I don't think you should lift that. I can lift that. Dad-- Yeah, a wonderful place to work."
00:19:17.489,00:19:22.077,Dr. Johnson is now retired and his office is closed.
00:19:23.036,00:19:35.174,"If you still need to find another psychiatrist, Dr. Johnson suggests your insurance website, or call their customer service phone number."
00:19:36.133,00:19:44.224,"If you have a mental health crisis, don't hesitate to have someone drive you to the nearest emergency room."
00:19:46.018,00:19:52.024,"Dr. Johnson wishes you well, and thanks you for being his valued patient."
00:20:17.549,00:20:20.219,"So if you can get into a spot, you can always get out."
00:20:33.774,00:20:37.361,and going to work and to church faithfully ever since my mom died.
00:20:38.278,00:20:47.663,"My brother and I were both thousands of miles away, and despite what we'd already been through with Mom's Alzheimer's, we didn't notice anything until it was almost too late."
00:20:50.374,00:20:54.795,We started getting calls from his friends. Then his secretary.
00:20:54.878,00:20:59.633,"He was double-booking his patients, making mistakes on their prescriptions."
00:20:59.716,00:21:07.599,"He had driven his car at high speed through a construction site, and then kept going, five miles home, on four flat tires."
00:21:12.604,00:21:20.487,"Every call felt like an alarm bell, and even though we should have understood perfectly, we just couldn't bear to hear it again."
00:21:37.921,00:21:39.589,'cause you're moving to New York.
00:21:40.549,00:21:43.051,"-Yeah, it was said that. -Right. That's all."
00:21:43.135,00:21:46.096,"But who's selling it, and when, and where?"
00:21:46.179,00:21:49.391,It's being put on Craigslist this week.
00:21:50.017,00:21:52.436,It's at the repair shop being finished right now.
00:21:57.065,00:21:59.067,"But you're not getting the car back, I do know that."
00:21:59.151,00:22:00.569,I'm never driving it again?
00:22:01.194,00:22:02.612,No. Not that car.
00:22:03.447,00:22:04.781,Maybe some other car.
00:22:06.491,00:22:08.035,Is that the worst news ever?
00:22:08.118,00:22:11.163,"-Not the worst, but it's pretty bad news. -Yeah."
00:22:11.913,00:22:15.500,"You know, I'm not far enough gone that I couldn't drive my own car, you know?"
00:22:15.584,00:22:18.879,"Well, it's not about that, it's about the fact that you're moving to New York."
00:22:18.962,00:22:21.131,-I know. And I'm not taking my car. -You can't keep it.
00:22:21.214,00:22:22.424,-I know that. -That's all.
00:22:22.507,00:22:26.136,But in between now and the time-- It's only a couple days.
00:22:27.804,00:22:28.680,Okay.
00:22:31.850,00:22:33.018,I know it hurts.
00:22:35.062,00:22:36.855,"It's your independence, isn't it?"
00:22:36.938,00:22:38.356,-Yeah. -Yeah.
00:22:49.284,00:22:52.996,"Well, I know how Mom must have felt when we put her in the nursing home."
00:22:56.917,00:22:58.376,-Not that bad. -It's not that bad.
00:22:58.460,00:22:59.795,-Not that bad. -It's not that bad.
00:22:59.878,00:23:01.838,"It's not that bad, but that was bad."
00:23:01.922,00:23:03.673,You're more conscious than she was then.
00:23:03.757,00:23:16.061,"Yeah. But, uh, you're not giving me credit Yes, we are. Stop it. We just are not paying $2,000 to put a car in a rental car garage in New York City, that's all."
00:23:16.144,00:23:18.313,"-That's all. Yeah, I hear ya. -That's all we're doin'."
00:23:18.396,00:23:20.857,"-You hear me? -Yeah, I hear ya."
00:23:41.128,00:23:45.382,is that it hurts people's feelings when I don't remember things about them.
00:23:48.677,00:23:50.470,You remember everything about your old MG.
00:23:50.554,00:23:51.596,"Yeah, that's right."
00:23:51.680,00:23:55.976,But recent memories are... They don't stick around.
00:23:58.103,00:23:59.855,You don't want to hurt your friends.
00:24:14.494,00:24:18.498,"Not valves, it was... it was double, um, artery."
00:24:20.041,00:24:21.501,"Bypass. Double bypass, yeah."
00:24:21.585,00:24:24.087,"-Coronary artery bypass. -Right, that's what it was."
00:24:34.306,00:24:37.142,"All right, I do it like this, and then I do it like this."
00:24:46.610,00:24:51.323,You are completely absolved of anything that happens to me after today.
00:25:03.960,00:25:06.213,"Well, at least a bite at a time."
00:25:29.194,00:25:31.529,Do you think she needed memory work then?
00:25:43.959,00:25:49.714,She... She did so well in the class that the instructor asked her to work for him.
00:25:51.132,00:25:53.510,"So when I was courting her, she was doing all that stuff."
00:25:53.593,00:25:56.638,Uh-huh. So she had a great memory then.
00:25:58.807,00:26:08.483,"I just remember her coming up with names of things, like, you remember, like, an alligator sitting eating an ice-cream cone on the top of a ladder, you know-- -That's how she'd do it. -It's like visual..."
00:26:08.566,00:26:11.611,Visual reminders that were sort of unusual...
00:26:11.695,00:26:14.155,-Yeah. -...they stick out in your mind.
00:26:15.448,00:26:17.075,You remember her teaching you that?
00:26:17.158,00:26:18.576,Yeah. I thought it was cool.
00:26:20.620,00:26:21.454,Yeah.
00:26:39.472,00:26:40.307,That work?
00:26:56.948,00:27:00.118,"So your name is, uh, Johnson."
00:27:10.378,00:27:11.796,I'll give you a hint.
00:27:12.672,00:27:13.965,I'm your daughter.
00:27:30.148,00:27:31.816,It's Kirsten. I'm Kirsten.
00:27:31.900,00:27:34.736,I know that one. And is there a C. Richard Johnson?
00:27:35.779,00:27:37.280,Same family?
00:27:40.492,00:27:41.785,Should we go downstairs?
00:27:48.375,00:27:54.047,"I've been shooting documentaries for nearly 30 years, but this is almost all the footage I've got of Mom."
00:27:56.966,00:28:01.096,I don't have a single frame of the warm and brilliant person she once was.
00:28:09.854,00:28:11.731,So when Mom was really...
00:28:16.236,00:28:18.405,"and we were gonna move her from the house, remember?"
00:28:18.488,00:28:25.495,"She, um... She came out here and she sat in this chair -and she was like, This is our house. -Uh-huh."
00:28:25.578,00:28:28.623,"And I was like, It's okay, Mom, we don't have to move you."
00:28:31.167,00:28:34.587,"She sat there and that's when she started singing Que Sera, Sera."
00:28:34.671,00:28:36.214,-Oh. -Mmm-hmm.
00:28:42.011,00:28:44.055,-She was tough. -She was tough.
00:29:13.293,00:29:16.504,"But I remember her being just like, This is our house."
00:29:51.539,00:29:53.958,are gonna be turned into feet with toes.
00:29:54.584,00:29:55.794,Of... clothes?
00:29:55.877,00:29:56.753,-With toes. -Toes.
00:29:56.836,00:29:58.463,Your feet are gonna be turned into feet with toes.
00:29:58.546,00:29:59.589,How are you gonna do that?
00:29:59.672,00:30:02.759,"Well, we're gonna do a close-up on your real feet..."
00:30:02.842,00:30:05.386,and then we're gonna have another person...
00:30:06.221,00:30:12.519,"We're gonna do, like, the gold cloth in front of your feet, and then someone else's bare feet are gonna be there."
00:30:12.602,00:30:16.940,"Yeah. Um, because you said to me once that that was..."
00:30:17.023,00:30:21.361,"If you could wish for anything, that was the wish that-- Really, I told you that?"
00:30:21.444,00:30:22.862,"Yeah, I was kind of surprised."
00:30:22.946,00:30:24.823,I thought you'd wish for world peace or something.
00:30:28.535,00:30:30.829,-I thought-- -I'd wish for Mom not to die.
00:30:30.912,00:30:32.622,-That would be your wish? -Mmm-hmm.
00:30:32.705,00:30:34.165,"Yeah. Yeah, I could see that."
00:30:35.083,00:30:36.751,"Yeah, I would wish for that, too."
00:32:24.525,00:32:25.735,What a mess.
00:32:26.861,00:32:28.738,There's Mom up on top of the case.
00:32:42.126,00:32:44.337,Just stay here. What do you think about that?
00:32:47.632,00:32:50.093,"-It's such a great house. -Yeah, it is, isn't it?"
00:32:50.176,00:32:51.552,It's crazy to leave it.
00:32:53.054,00:32:57.934,"Yeah, well, the problem is, if you don't leave it, I don't get close to you."
00:33:00.645,00:33:04.941,"So, I'd trade this house any day for being with you."
00:33:09.153,00:33:11.656,-That's not even a consideration. -Yeah.
00:34:07.670,00:34:08.880,"Yeah. Thank you, Carl."
00:34:17.346,00:34:29.942,"You got me all this stuff here, It's hard to believe. That's all right, I'm a believer."
00:34:30.026,00:34:31.819,-You're a believer. -I'm a true believer.
00:34:31.903,00:34:33.738,"Yeah, good show, sweetie."
00:35:25.331,00:35:27.083,We're raising a glass to Forrest Vu.
00:35:40.012,00:35:44.725,"Come on, guys. Let's do it. Dad, you coming?"
00:35:58.531,00:35:59.365,Two.
00:36:08.207,00:36:10.293,"-Should I go get it? -No, I got money."
00:36:10.376,00:36:12.044,You don't need it. We're not getting anything.
00:36:12.128,00:36:13.087,All right.
00:36:20.011,00:36:21.762,Watch out. Watch where you're going.
00:36:21.846,00:36:24.682,You guys watching for bicycles? Can you watch for me?
00:36:29.312,00:36:32.982,"I'm gonna go down and get back, and get my dad. I'll be back."
00:36:35.818,00:36:37.361,"Just watch the bikes, Dad."
00:37:56.816,00:37:59.735,Ever had a fantasy of what you would do with this period of your life?
00:38:01.112,00:38:03.072,"-You didn't even think about it. -No, I didn't."
00:38:03.155,00:38:04.282,You didn't think about the future.
00:38:04.365,00:38:09.704,I'm pretty good about living in the here and the now.
00:38:48.701,00:38:52.038,"I'm gonna give you five words to remember for me, okay? Ready?"
00:38:52.705,00:38:57.543,"Face, velvet, church, daisy, and red."
00:38:57.626,00:38:58.919,Can you repeat them?
00:39:02.590,00:39:03.507,Velvet.
00:39:05.593,00:39:06.719,Red.
00:39:06.802,00:39:08.137,And I for... I don't know.
00:39:10.389,00:39:15.102,"Face, velvet, church, daisy, and red."
00:39:16.729,00:39:22.651,"Face, velvet, daisy, and red."
00:39:24.779,00:39:36.040,"If I tell you that a banana and an orange are the same because they're both fruit, how are a what... How are a train and bicycle the same?"
00:39:39.627,00:39:41.879,Remember those words I asked you to remember?
00:39:57.561,00:39:59.188,You remember any of them?
00:39:59.271,00:40:01.023,One was a body part.
00:40:04.568,00:40:06.362,-Face. -Okay. Good.
00:40:17.039,00:40:20.376,-...he's scoring 19 now. -Oh. I'm falling apart.
00:40:23.254,00:40:25.381,"-Oh, it's better. -It's better than it was?"
00:40:28.926,00:40:30.886,-Okay. Do-- -I don't think it's any worse.
00:40:30.970,00:40:35.057,"Okay. So that's why we're gonna ask your daughter for some information, if that's okay."
00:40:35.141,00:40:36.142,"Well, okay."
00:40:36.225,00:40:39.103,"Okay, so do you think his memory is changing?"
00:40:41.772,00:40:47.236,"I was trying to think of something to say, but I couldn't stop thinking about what's coming."
00:40:47.736,00:40:50.406,His moments of forgetfulness are going to spread.
00:40:51.323,00:40:54.535,He'll ask the same questions over and over again.
00:40:54.618,00:40:56.537,His eyes will get that distant look.
00:40:57.580,00:40:59.748,And his personality will begin to fade away.
00:41:01.208,00:41:05.963,"And he won't be able to follow what I'm saying, so I won't be able to ask him any more advice."
00:41:07.298,00:41:09.800,"And the whole time, we'll just be trying to get by."
00:41:17.183,00:41:20.186,"Okay, are you good? All right, so, Dad, we can start walking."
00:41:20.269,00:41:24.607,"Let's start walking, just start walking to me, you're doing a great speed. That's fantastic."
00:41:24.690,00:41:25.900,Just keep on walking.
00:41:25.983,00:41:28.152,Watch your step here 'cause it's bumpy.
00:41:28.235,00:41:34.074,"Just... be careful, Okay, so, Dad, just watch your step, and Jake..."
00:41:38.704,00:41:41.874,"Okay, three, two, one, drop."
00:41:44.543,00:41:45.419,Oh.
00:41:51.759,00:41:54.887,"Oh, you made that poor guy fall instead of me."
00:42:02.353,00:42:03.771,They're wearing you out. I get scared.
00:42:03.854,00:42:05.648,Did you get me good on the sound?
00:42:05.731,00:42:16.784,"-Yeah, I heard that. -Was it-- Kirsten has a mic, so even though I was far away, Yeah. And I get scared each time, -'cause I see this red jacket falling... -Oh, yeah."
00:42:16.867,00:42:18.827,-...and I think it's you. -It is me.
00:42:20.955,00:42:24.041,"-That was enough to make my heart flutter. -Oh, thank you."
00:43:24.810,00:43:26.687,This is Lolita?
00:43:31.942,00:43:33.402,"Oh, it's so good to see you."
00:43:39.366,00:43:40.909,I would know you anywhere.
00:43:40.993,00:43:44.330,And let's make an agreement that neither of us ever will.
00:43:44.413,00:43:45.247,"Oh, okay."
00:43:48.083,00:43:49.543,Come on in.
00:43:55.633,00:43:57.801,-and we pick up where we left off. -That's right.
00:44:15.319,00:44:27.414,"He told me that when he goes into the morgue and he sees all these tables with a body on it, he just felt a thrill go through him."
00:44:32.169,00:44:35.547,-Yeah. -...and I'm the only one -that can figure it out. -That can solve it.
00:44:47.267,00:44:50.854,being with a pathologist so long? Did you think differently about death?
00:44:53.148,00:44:58.153,"Well... I don't know. I suppose, a little bit, but..."
00:45:02.157,00:45:03.826,It's just inevitable...
00:45:05.786,00:45:09.123,-and a part of who we all are. -Yeah.
00:45:11.834,00:45:15.295,"-What's your relationship to all that? -Oh, I'm definitely a believer."
00:45:18.507,00:45:22.428,"The Bible says that people will be resurrected, that's good enough for me."
00:45:29.893,00:45:33.272,"Those are pretty clothes, but you would have been prettier without them."
00:45:33.355,00:45:37.025,You don't know all the sagging that's been going on.
00:45:37.109,00:45:40.028,Oh. Of course I know. Of course I know.
00:45:40.112,00:45:43.740,"You know, wrinkles make twice as much surface area, really."
00:45:43.824,00:45:47.035,"-Oh, yes. -Really, it's improved by the wrinkles."
00:45:47.119,00:45:50.122,-You don't really have many... -I need some.
00:45:50.205,00:45:51.999,-I need some. Yeah. -Yes. Yes.
00:47:32.558,00:47:35.269,"but we're getting paid to do this, so..."
00:47:40.148,00:47:41.608,"I'm not getting paid, am I?"
00:47:51.535,00:47:53.745,"Well, why do you become a documentarian?"
00:47:54.913,00:47:57.916,"Why not just make fiction films, where the big bucks are?"
00:48:03.714,00:48:08.510,is often much more fascinating than what you can make up.
00:48:17.769,00:48:20.564,"So, you're paid for the adventure-making."
00:48:33.952,00:48:36.204,Do you remember when your mom came to live with us?
00:48:36.705,00:48:37.581,Mmm-mmm.
00:48:40.500,00:48:42.628,-At Bozarts? -Where were you living?
00:48:44.129,00:48:46.798,"You were there. Oh, yeah. Yeah, when you were a child."
00:48:53.347,00:48:55.891,And now you're recreating history.
00:49:05.984,00:49:09.154,What do you remember about that time with your mo... Grandma?
00:49:12.532,00:49:14.951,"we always wanted her to make that, um..."
00:49:16.203,00:49:21.333,"either the coconut cream pie or the chocolate cream pie, -and she kept making-- -It was coconut cream."
00:49:23.085,00:49:25.295,and she kept making the banana cream pie.
00:49:37.432,00:49:38.266,Nice.
00:50:28.233,00:50:30.402,-With the wolf on it? -Yeah.
00:50:46.877,00:50:48.003,Would you like this...
00:50:51.006,00:50:52.174,I'm gonna sit down.
00:50:53.508,00:50:57.012,"Ah, how sweet it is. Yes, indeed."
00:50:58.847,00:51:02.601,Am I tired? My feet are like concrete blocks.
00:51:50.774,00:51:55.695,I think it's more apparent to people around me than it is to me.
00:52:00.659,00:52:01.618,Yeah.
00:52:09.209,00:52:13.088,"Nothing much more than, uh, it says. I, you know..."
00:52:13.171,00:52:17.592,"You know, if I... I... I sort of..."
00:52:17.676,00:52:21.721,"I'm living with you now, and, uh..."
00:52:23.431,00:52:27.143,"I... For you, it might get worse, you know?"
00:52:27.686,00:52:30.647,You might have to take care of me more than you do now.
00:52:31.314,00:52:35.527,"But, uh, I like living with you, so I'm not terribly worried about it."
00:52:41.074,00:52:44.119,"if it gets worse to a certain place, I don't want to live."
00:52:44.744,00:52:47.122,"No, I love life too much for that."
00:52:51.501,00:52:54.588,that Mom was in where she couldn't communicate?
00:52:54.671,00:52:58.383,"Yeah, I think so. But I give you permission to euthanize me."
00:53:00.510,00:53:02.762,At what point do I have permission to do that?
00:53:02.846,00:53:06.016,Well... pass it by me before you do it.
00:53:55.398,00:53:57.400,No. What I really want is a beer.
00:54:10.914,00:54:12.540,"No, I'm bleeding to death."
00:54:13.416,00:54:14.751,I'm dying.
00:54:32.978,00:54:38.441,"So this is what I'm gonna stick to your neck, and this is where the blood will actually come out of."
00:54:38.525,00:54:49.494,"This is going to go along here, and then all of this is gonna go Then I pump the blood through there, which forces it to shoot right out."
00:54:49.577,00:54:50.578,Where are you getting the blood?
00:54:59.546,00:55:02.048,"Oh, I thought you just explained to me how you did it."
00:55:08.555,00:55:09.639,I thought you were talking...
00:55:14.269,00:55:19.107,"I like my blood, I've grown accustomed to its-- -You can hang on to all of your blood. -Good."
00:55:19.190,00:55:20.650,Not a drop of your blood will be spilled on this plan.
00:55:20.734,00:55:22.068,Excellent. Very good.
00:55:22.152,00:55:23.486,So you feel comfortable with it?
00:55:23.570,00:55:25.363,-I'm comfortable with that. -Great.
00:55:28.992,00:55:31.244,Let's all only use the word fake blood.
00:56:13.286,00:56:17.207,he doubted that someone as extraordinary as her would ever accept him.
00:56:18.500,00:56:24.589,"He felt so much shame about the strangeness of his feet, and he didn't want to reveal them to anyone."
00:56:26.549,00:56:29.052,But then he learned about the grief she was hiding.
00:56:30.386,00:56:41.189,"On the day of her graduation from college, a drunk driver crashed into her car, killing her mother, who was riding alongside her in the passenger seat."
00:56:45.401,00:56:47.153,My mom was a visual person.
00:56:48.071,00:56:50.657,She photographed flowers and landscapes.
00:56:50.740,00:56:53.493,She and I shared a love of the color orange.
00:56:55.370,00:57:12.679,"But when I think of that moment, when she looked over and saw her beloved mother suddenly dead right next to her, I feel like I could now finally understand why she wanted to forever turn away from things that were difficult to see."
00:57:19.310,00:57:22.689,It would be so easy if loving only gave us the beautiful.
00:57:24.232,00:57:28.027,But what loving demands is that we face the fear of losing each other.
00:57:29.446,00:57:32.740,"That when it gets messy, we hold each other close."
00:57:35.118,00:57:40.165,"And when we can, we defiantly celebrate our brief moments of joy."
00:59:11.256,00:59:14.926,"Much worse. I mean, much more unpleasant. Much more painful."
00:59:21.975,00:59:23.059,I think we gotta stop.
00:59:54.632,00:59:56.634,"Uh, well..."
01:00:01.556,01:00:06.686,...from the last 30 years I've been here in New York.
01:00:10.732,01:00:14.777,with different kind cancer patients.
01:00:16.195,01:00:19.490,Paranoia. Stroke patients.
01:00:21.784,01:00:23.786,I can take this. Thank you.
01:00:28.916,01:00:31.669,We're just talking about how much Marta knows about...
01:00:32.712,01:00:35.298,about what people go through at the end of their lives.
01:00:36.674,01:00:39.677,She's saying she's accompanied ten different people.
01:00:40.928,01:00:42.513,And now there's 11.
01:00:42.597,01:00:45.975,"And I know the families, and..."
01:00:51.648,01:00:56.152,"Right, it is, yeah. Mmm-hmm. It's a mental health profession."
01:01:00.990,01:01:02.909,You've both dealt with...
01:01:04.160,01:01:09.582,"paranoia, schizophrenia, psychotic behavior."
01:01:12.377,01:01:24.472,"I think, in my experience, is if you're accepting stuff, right, Much easier. And fighting something that you can't..."
01:01:24.555,01:01:26.432,-Right. -Fighting it doesn't bring it back.
01:01:31.104,01:01:36.317,"Especially you can't control sickness, -the conditions... -Certainly can't."
01:01:36.401,01:01:38.861,-You can't control death. -You can't control people.
01:01:43.324,01:01:45.410,-Deal with it. -Deal with.
01:01:47.078,01:01:55.878,"I remember I work in New Jersey, I save life a few times for a man who had heart attack."
01:01:55.962,01:02:00.383,"After that, I remember he gave me $20 after that."
01:02:02.176,01:02:06.931,"It means so much for me. Like, you saved my life."
01:02:21.487,01:02:22.947,See you tomorrow.
01:02:24.866,01:02:26.325,I love the bunny.
01:02:33.082,01:02:35.793,We all need a little bunny with us at these times.
01:02:39.964,01:02:40.882,Yeah.
01:02:41.591,01:02:45.136,"Yeah, it definitely feels like he's sleeping more and more, doesn't it?"
01:02:47.263,01:02:48.598,"with this camera, huh?"
01:02:52.018,01:02:53.895,I don't consider it harassment.
01:03:05.907,01:03:08.201,He's doing it for me with love. He'll do anything for me.
01:03:08.284,01:03:10.661,"I mean, I just have to be careful about, like..."
01:03:11.704,01:03:18.294,"you know, not overstepping the bounds of what's decent for him, but it's hard to know what that is anymore."
01:03:18.920,01:03:22.465,"Yeah, he's happy. He's laughing no matter what."
01:03:22.548,01:03:24.342,-He is. Yeah. -Right?
01:03:24.425,01:03:29.430,"And he's accepting... I mean, he's very smart."
01:03:31.140,01:03:35.353,"-But the memory, what you gonna do? -Yeah."
01:03:50.409,01:03:53.913,"Shut the door behind you when you leave, because the light's on and it keeps me awake."
01:05:21.667,01:05:24.003,and you got dressed and came looking for the patient.
01:05:27.882,01:05:31.218,...and then you got dressed and you came to look for the patient.
01:06:09.340,01:06:24.730,"Well, just more forcibly go back... Wake me up and tell me, you know, you... you... You no longer have a practice, this is not your office, this is where you're living and sleeping, and go back to bed."
01:06:25.481,01:06:27.566,You're bothering me and the children.
01:06:33.155,01:06:34.949,"Come here, let me see, let me see."
01:06:36.701,01:06:38.995,"Okay, we're crossing, guys. Crossing."
01:08:01.243,01:08:04.413,"We have to get Grandpa, and let Marco go home..."
01:08:11.796,01:08:13.172,Hold on.
01:08:13.255,01:08:16.092,"Where are they? Oh, they're that way? They must be."
01:08:49.583,01:08:53.921,"You gotta get into the car, come around that side, be really careful of the traffic."
01:08:54.463,01:09:05.641,"You were at the house of one of the kids, and then we sat you down in front of the TV ...and we came back."
01:09:14.150,01:09:16.110,not... not knowable place.
01:09:23.617,01:09:25.494,and grateful that you found me. Okay?
01:09:25.578,01:09:28.372,-And rescuing me. -We'll never lose you.
01:09:37.506,01:09:39.675,I have no idea what I would've done.
01:09:43.304,01:09:47.516,"Oh, man, sweetie, your father is a wreck."
01:10:08.078,01:10:09.538,when I left him all alone.
01:10:10.873,01:10:12.917,But I was nervous putting him into it.
01:10:13.876,01:10:16.795,It's so rare that he's completely himself anymore.
01:10:17.880,01:10:21.508,"The other night, I stopped him from leaving the apartment at 3:00 a.m."
01:10:21.592,01:10:25.429,He thought he had a train to catch. He said he was on a secret mission.
01:10:26.889,01:10:33.687,"But when I stepped onto the set to lead him out, there was a moment of clarity, and we both knew what this was really about."
01:10:35.147,01:10:37.149,It was about what it was about with Mom.
01:10:38.192,01:10:42.947,That I would have to leave him somewhere. Someday. Somehow.
01:10:44.531,01:10:45.824,I'll stretch the elastic.
01:11:01.173,01:11:14.979,"In Adventism, after a global apocalypse, Jesus will return to earth to resurrect His followers, the righteous, and bring them up with Him to heaven for eternity."
01:11:16.689,01:11:20.693,"So in the face of death, there's hope that everything will be okay."
01:11:24.613,01:11:35.291,"But what Adventism recognizes, that I've never grasped before, is that the worst thing, the deepest fear, is being left behind."
01:11:52.433,01:11:56.395,"Dad, you know I'm going to, uh, Israel tonight."
01:12:07.281,01:12:11.368,"Yeah, it's hard. Well, not really. Not actually."
01:12:11.452,01:12:13.203,-You know I... I miss you. -Yeah.
01:12:13.287,01:12:15.581,-Yeah. -I miss you.
01:12:16.498,01:12:21.003,is there anything you want me to do... Or do while you're gone?
01:12:21.670,01:12:23.964,-Mmm... -How would you like me to behave?
01:12:24.590,01:12:26.300,"Well, you're doing great behaving."
01:12:26.383,01:12:27.968,You don't need me to tell you how to behave.
01:12:31.013,01:12:32.765,"When you're here, I'm behaving greatly."
01:12:39.605,01:12:41.940,I don't know what to do without you.
01:12:42.024,01:12:44.193,"-You be careful, okay? -I will be careful."
01:12:44.276,01:12:48.364,You have this little brother that you need to take care of.
01:12:48.447,01:12:57.456,"-Are you my little brother? -I'm your little brother, That's so cute that I'm your little brother. You're my little brother."
01:12:57.539,01:12:58.916,I'm your little brother.
01:12:58.999,01:13:01.502,"I'm no longer your father, I'm your little brother."
01:13:01.585,01:13:03.253,What does the little brother do?
01:13:03.337,01:13:06.965,"Oh, he just tags along behind. Gets in your way."
01:13:09.635,01:13:11.845,-Little brothers are fun. -Are they? Okay.
01:13:14.348,01:13:17.393,"Mmm. Your eyes get a little, like, teary."
01:13:19.269,01:13:20.854,or it's just your eyes are that way?
01:13:20.938,01:13:22.815,"-That's real, they're real tears. -Aw."
01:13:25.901,01:13:28.487,From joy. Love.
01:13:43.544,01:13:49.258,your pie plate with the chocolate first.
01:13:56.557,01:14:00.269,for Grandpa's 86th birthday. Just to have forever.
01:14:15.617,01:14:20.539,"But lucky... lucky he won't... He will forget, right?"
01:14:31.341,01:14:36.096,"We find leaves both above and below the K-T boundary, but they're different leaves."
01:14:36.180,01:14:40.851,"So there was not only a dinosaur extinction, but there was a major plant extinction as well."
01:14:40.934,01:14:49.318,"With little to eat, dinosaurs, mosasaurs, and nearly 75% of known species go extinct."
01:15:01.747,01:15:03.290,"Oh, wow!"
01:15:55.592,01:15:59.137,"I'll tell you, it's the best chocolate cake I ever had."
01:15:59.221,01:16:01.640,And I had a lot of chocolate cakes.
01:16:36.550,01:16:45.767,"We have an 86-year-old male in cardiac arrest witnessed, the patient's currently in V-fib, one shock delivered, CPR is in progress, ETA is about six minutes."
01:16:48.937,01:16:51.815,"We're gonna do a pulse check, rhythm check after this. Not a problem, ma'am."
01:17:18.091,01:17:22.012,"put on your seatbelt, for your safety. And I will explain it while I go."
01:17:22.095,01:17:24.681,"Five, six, seven, eight."
01:17:48.580,01:17:54.378,"One day I was going to work, and on the way to work, I witnessed the suicide of a woman..."
01:17:55.671,01:17:59.049,who jumped two meters ahead of me from the bridge.
01:18:01.134,01:18:05.597,The first thing that I did when I came to work was to send an email to...
01:18:10.727,01:18:13.063,"It was a subject line, it said, Help."
01:18:14.773,01:18:16.566,And he called me right away.
01:18:19.194,01:18:29.746,"His ability to recognize the hurt and the loss, and to find the best way through that, was something incredible."
01:18:35.001,01:18:37.963,He was the first person I called when my husband died.
01:18:42.759,01:18:47.139,And it kind of broke my heart a few days later when I saw him...
01:18:48.140,01:18:50.100,when he gave me a big hug...
01:18:51.226,01:18:54.855,"and then five minutes later, asked me how is my husband doing."
01:19:00.861,01:19:02.279,And I realized...
01:19:03.196,01:19:06.867,this is yet another kind of loss. The loss of memory.
01:19:13.790,01:19:17.627,"But I know one thing, that for as long as my memory lives..."
01:19:18.253,01:19:20.130,the memory of him will be in me.
01:19:22.549,01:19:23.383,Thank you.
01:19:42.778,01:19:46.740,Dick loved to attend the many parties at our home.
01:19:47.407,01:19:52.162,He loved my tradition of ending a party on a happy note.
01:19:52.871,01:20:10.388,"Around 10:00 p.m., I would ring a bell, get everybody's attention, and with a loud voice, announce, You have eaten all my food, you have drunk all my wine, you said everything worth hearing, now it's time to go home."
01:20:25.946,01:20:33.286,"Before they left, I would play a tune on my hunting horn called Going Away."
01:20:44.422,01:20:47.300,"Dick came over and said, Ray..."
01:20:49.594,01:20:54.474,"if you outlive me, I want you to play 'Going Away...' Oh, God."
01:20:59.479,01:21:02.274,I want you to play 'Going Away' at my funeral.
01:21:16.580,01:21:18.290,Mom's funeral was here.
01:21:19.749,01:21:36.099,"And just before we moved Dad from Seattle to New York, a little over three years ago, our family, our friends, our congregation, all gathered with generosity and love to let us film this farewell to Dad."
01:21:36.766,01:21:38.977,Even knowing that he was still alive.
01:21:47.027,01:21:58.121,"My lip muscles are weak, my breath is limited, but, Dick, I think he thinks it's the real thing."
01:22:29.027,01:22:30.528,"See you later, Dick."
01:24:17.093,01:24:19.888,We thought that maybe we could stop what was coming.
01:24:19.971,01:24:21.848,That we'd found a way to hold on.
01:24:24.100,01:24:25.643,Or almost found a way.
01:24:34.235,01:24:36.738,What can you say when you've lost a best friend?
01:24:39.365,01:24:40.366,Or a mother?
01:24:42.577,01:24:45.038,Or your best friend and your father?
01:24:52.295,01:24:55.256,All I know is that Dick Johnson is dead.
01:24:57.383,01:24:59.886,All I know is that Dick Johnson is dead.
01:25:02.639,01:25:05.183,All I can say is Dick Johnson is dead.
01:25:08.603,01:25:11.731,"And all I want to say is long live, Dick Johnson."
01:25:17.570,01:25:18.404,Thank you.
00:27:32.067,00:27:34.944,I know that one. And is there a C. Richard Johnson?
00:27:35.987,00:27:37.238,Same family?
00:35:24.539,00:35:27.208,We're raising a glass to Forrest Vu.
00:35:28.292,00:35:30.002,-Did he die? -No!
00:35:30.086,00:35:31.129,Born!
00:35:31.212,00:35:32.213,She.
01:21:56.036,01:21:58.163,I think he thinks it's the real thing.
