00:03:58.071,00:04:00.323,Are you okay? You're not eating anything.
00:04:00.990,00:04:03.201,I told you I wasn't feeling well.
00:04:10.124,00:04:11.960,Tell her how great she was.
00:04:12.627,00:04:15.880,It's kind of hard to compliment someone who's always in a foul mood.
00:04:21.427,00:04:23.388,You were really good.
00:04:28.017,00:04:29.894,-Mm. -Tell her.
00:04:31.271,00:04:35.858,Your mother wants me to tell you how great you are.
00:04:37.986,00:04:39.654,Eat shit.
00:06:30.181,00:06:31.224,You got it.
00:06:48.282,00:06:50.368,Are you feeling any better?
00:06:52.662,00:06:54.163,Not really.
00:06:56.165,00:06:58.000,Do you want me to call Dr. Pat?
00:06:58.668,00:06:59.710,No.
00:07:02.004,00:07:04.423,She needs to get her head checked.
00:07:08.052,00:07:09.971,"All right, come on."
00:07:10.763,00:07:12.140,Jacket on.
00:07:13.474,00:07:16.269,"-Let's go, let's go. -Where's my arm?"
00:08:03.733,00:08:06.694,"Um, I wanted to know if I could possibly take a test."
00:08:07.612,00:08:09.697,That's what we do. That's what we're here for.
00:08:10.198,00:08:14.118,"Uh, why don't you sign in, take off your coat, and have a seat."
00:08:14.744,00:08:16.078,Okay.
00:08:23.419,00:08:25.046,Yep.
00:08:35.139,00:08:37.600,"Uh, we've got a girl out here for a test."
00:08:58.871,00:09:00.289,You ready?
00:09:06.254,00:09:08.673,Come on in and make yourself at home.
00:09:09.215,00:09:12.593,"You can just sit here, and… and, uh, we'll talk for a bit."
00:09:21.310,00:09:23.229,What brings you here today?
00:09:24.438,00:09:26.691,I just haven't been feeling that well lately.
00:09:27.275,00:09:28.693,I'm sorry to hear that.
00:09:29.402,00:09:31.779,How long has that been going on?
00:09:31.862,00:09:32.863,A while.
00:09:33.781,00:09:36.075,And when was your last period?
00:09:37.326,00:09:39.912,I don't know exactly. I'm kind of irregular.
00:09:42.164,00:09:43.541,How old are you?
00:09:43.624,00:09:45.209,"Um, 17."
00:09:46.961,00:09:48.879,Does mom know you're here?
00:09:49.463,00:09:51.507,"Uh, no. She's working."
00:09:52.800,00:09:54.343,"Oh, I understand."
00:09:55.177,00:09:59.390,"Uh, well, today, we're going to be doing a self-administered test."
00:10:00.349,00:10:02.435,But I want to let you know something.
00:10:02.518,00:10:06.230,"Even if it's negative, it could still be positive."
00:10:06.981,00:10:08.899,What does that mean exactly?
00:10:10.401,00:10:15.740,"Well, I mean, if it's negative, you might want to redo the test in a few weeks if you're still concerned."
00:10:17.199,00:10:18.492,Okay.
00:10:57.907,00:11:00.660,"So, just dip it in here."
00:11:00.743,00:11:02.703,Is that a test from the supermarket?
00:11:03.496,00:11:04.372,Yes.
00:11:04.455,00:11:07.416,I told you it was a self-administered test.
00:11:36.445,00:11:38.072,That looks like a positive.
00:11:42.743,00:11:47.164,"Um, if it's positive, is there any way it could be negative?"
00:11:47.748,00:11:48.874,No.
00:11:48.958,00:11:51.544,A positive is always a positive.
00:15:12.286,00:15:13.787,Hi. How are you?
00:15:27.051,00:15:29.637,-How are you doing today? -Okay.
00:15:33.849,00:15:36.310,It looks suspiciously like you are throwing a party.
00:15:37.895,00:15:40.689,"Um, hey, you inviting yourself?"
00:15:46.153,00:15:47.947,Sorry. That's not what I meant.
00:16:02.962,00:16:05.047,"-40, 50, 60… -Wait, not at the same time."
00:16:05.130,00:16:06.924,-You'll mess me up. -Sorry.
00:17:04.940,00:17:06.316,I saw you weren't at school today.
00:17:07.985,00:17:09.445,I went to the doctor.
00:17:10.571,00:17:12.031,Are you okay?
00:17:13.198,00:17:14.324,"Yeah, I'm fine."
00:17:14.408,00:17:15.701,What's wrong?
00:17:17.369,00:17:18.579,Girl problems.
00:17:19.538,00:17:20.914,Bad cramps?
00:17:20.998,00:17:22.124,Yeah.
00:17:25.419,00:17:29.173,"Pretty much burn through a bottle of painkillers, like, every month."
00:17:31.717,00:17:33.927,Don't you ever just wish you were a dude?
00:17:35.095,00:17:36.513,All the time.
00:17:43.062,00:17:44.938,I like that thing.
00:17:45.022,00:17:46.982,"Oh, thanks."
00:18:15.969,00:18:18.430,At least someone in this house loves me.
00:18:18.514,00:18:21.225,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:18:21.934,00:18:23.060,Hey.
00:18:31.151,00:18:33.237,"Who's a good girl, hm?"
00:18:36.657,00:18:38.617,"Yeah, you like that."
00:18:39.785,00:18:41.703,You little slut.
00:18:41.787,00:18:44.164,-Who's a little slut? -Stop.
00:18:51.880,00:18:53.632,Look how easy she is.
00:19:58.197,00:20:00.699,This is your beautiful baby.
00:20:03.577,00:20:06.663,You are about ten weeks along.
00:20:07.664,00:20:13.253,"Hard to say precisely, but… everything looks pretty normal."
00:20:16.840,00:20:22.137,And this… is the most magical sound you will ever hear.
00:20:57.839,00:20:59.675,Are you okay?
00:21:00.926,00:21:02.594,"Yeah, I'm fine."
00:21:03.345,00:21:12.729,"I know this is a lot to take in, but I'm sure once you have that beautiful baby in your arms, you'll forget you ever had any doubts."
00:21:13.397,00:21:14.856,I know these things.
00:21:14.940,00:21:16.191,I'm a mother.
00:21:16.275,00:21:18.235,I just can't imagine that for myself.
00:21:20.404,00:21:24.658,There are many wonderful people who want children and can't have them.
00:21:25.492,00:21:28.537,We can connect you to an adoption agency.
00:21:30.497,00:21:32.708,I just don't know what I want to do right now.
00:21:35.502,00:21:37.337,Are you abortion-minded?
00:21:38.922,00:21:40.590,Is that a possibility?
00:21:44.011,00:21:45.554,Do you have a minute?
00:21:45.637,00:21:47.139,Could I show you something?
00:22:08.035,00:22:14.791,The video you are about to see unmasks the terrible truth that abortion is an act of violence which kills a baby.
00:22:15.375,00:22:20.172,Some of the children we'll show you represent typical nine and ten-week abortions.
00:22:20.255,00:22:32.225,"Because abortions are never committed prior to the sixth week of pregnancy, every child abortion kills is already so fully-formed that her heart's beating and her brain's producing brain wave activity."
00:22:32.309,00:25:32.781,"Many of the babies you'll see, however, range in age through the second and third trimesters of pregnancy… I'll put this in the bag for you, if that's okay."
00:26:20.745,00:26:22.205,Hey. Are you okay?
00:26:28.795,00:26:30.839,Should I call your mom?
00:26:37.220,00:26:38.513,Are you sure?
00:26:48.690,00:26:50.150,Why not?
00:26:52.777,00:26:54.821,I took a test.
00:27:21.014,00:27:22.724,"Uh, my cousin isn't feeling well."
00:27:23.224,00:27:24.351,What's wrong with her?
00:27:24.851,00:27:26.561,She has a stomach bug.
00:27:26.644,00:27:27.604,Okay.
00:27:27.687,00:27:29.564,I think I need to take her home.
00:27:30.982,00:27:33.026,"Well, she's on the schedule for two more hours."
00:27:33.109,00:27:34.319,Can't she wait?
00:27:34.402,00:27:35.528,She can't.
00:27:36.112,00:27:39.032,It's really just a few more hours.
00:27:39.115,00:27:40.909,I'd get lonely if you left.
00:27:42.827,00:27:44.079,I'll be fine.
00:32:55.598,00:32:56.766,Hello?
00:32:56.849,00:33:00.561,Hi. It's Beth calling from Ellensboro Women's Clinic.
00:33:00.645,00:33:01.938,"Uh, hi."
00:33:02.647,00:33:06.109,"Uh, I'd love to sit with you more and talk."
00:33:06.192,00:33:07.068,Okay.
00:33:07.151,00:33:10.863,I'm wondering if you can come back in later today.
00:33:10.947,00:33:12.949,"Um, no, I'm really busy."
00:33:13.032,00:33:14.242,Of course.
00:33:14.867,00:33:16.536,"Well, how about tomorrow?"
00:33:17.370,00:33:18.663,Can I call you back?
00:33:18.746,00:33:20.832,-Now's not a really good time. -No problem.
00:33:20.915,00:33:23.459,Or I… I could try you again in a little while.
00:33:23.543,00:33:26.337,"-Either way. -Yeah, yeah, okay. Bye."
00:33:56.451,00:33:57.744,Why?
00:33:57.827,00:33:59.454,I don't know why. We just do.
00:35:12.235,00:35:13.653,"Hey, excuse me."
00:35:18.950,00:35:21.160,Do you know what time this bus gets in?
00:35:24.747,00:35:26.290,"I don't know, like, 2 p.m."
00:35:27.959,00:35:29.335,Cool.
00:35:32.672,00:35:34.173,You going to New York?
00:35:35.216,00:35:36.384,Yeah.
00:35:37.301,00:35:39.262,Freaking love New York.
00:35:40.471,00:35:43.015,It's kind of my favorite city.
00:35:45.393,00:35:56.362,"Philly's cool and all, you know, it's definitely got history, but New York, like, I think because of the way the city's set up and everything, you're forced to interact with people who are just nothing like you."
00:35:57.905,00:35:59.240,Kind of like this bus.
00:36:01.534,00:36:02.702,That's funny.
00:36:13.880,00:36:18.926,"but, um… by any chance, do you girls like live music?"
00:36:19.010,00:36:22.555,"Oh, we're probably gonna be, um, pretty busy."
00:36:22.638,00:36:24.599,"Yeah. Yeah, I get it."
00:36:25.433,00:36:26.767,Sorry.
00:36:29.270,00:36:32.231,"Well, if you give me your number, I'll text you the info."
00:36:33.191,00:36:34.817,Maybe you'll change your mind.
00:36:51.959,00:36:53.085,Just texted you.
00:36:53.878,00:36:55.296,"Oh, got it."
00:37:49.642,00:37:51.852,You girls know where you're going?
00:37:51.936,00:37:53.688,-What? -Do you know where you're going?
00:37:53.771,00:37:54.939,"Yeah, yeah."
00:37:55.022,00:37:56.274,-You sure? -Yeah.
00:37:56.357,00:37:57.483,Okay.
00:37:58.150,00:37:59.318,I'll text you.
00:38:12.123,00:38:13.416,"Uh, hi. Excuse me."
00:38:15.042,00:38:19.380,Can you tell me how to get to 44 Court Street?
00:38:19.463,00:38:23.634,"Yeah, take the A or C downtown. Get off at J."
00:38:25.052,00:38:28.347,"Uh, how do you get… how do you get to the subway from here?"
00:38:28.431,00:38:30.141,Subway? Just go directly that way.
00:38:30.224,00:38:32.143,Go downstairs. Have a nice day.
00:38:32.727,00:38:34.020,Thanks.
00:41:37.703,00:41:39.413,"So, we're gonna get you all signed in."
00:41:39.497,00:41:42.166,"Um, you're gonna sign your name over here."
00:41:42.249,00:41:45.127,"All right, and then your date of birth."
00:41:46.212,00:41:47.421,And then today's date.
00:41:47.505,00:41:49.381,-And then your signature. -Okay.
00:41:49.465,00:41:52.343,"Let me know if you have any questions, and we'll call you when we're ready."
00:41:52.426,00:41:53.344,Yeah.
00:42:10.653,00:42:15.866,"I just want to review some information, and then we'll get you all set up."
00:42:15.950,00:42:16.867,Okay?
00:42:16.951,00:42:20.287,"Uh, can you start by verifying your name and date of birth, please?"
00:42:20.371,00:42:22.873,"Um, Autumn Callahan."
00:42:22.957,00:42:25.084,"August 19, 2002."
00:42:25.167,00:42:26.544,Okay.
00:42:26.627,00:42:32.007,"And in addition to the pregnancy test and the sonogram, we also like to have you tested for STDs."
00:42:32.091,00:42:33.300,Is that okay?
00:42:34.343,00:42:38.889,"Yeah, that's fine, um, but I did already take a pregnancy test, and I did a sonogram."
00:42:38.973,00:42:41.100,"Okay. All right, I understand."
00:42:41.183,00:42:48.816,"Um, but we always have to go by the one that we get today here in our office, with our technician and on our equipment."
00:42:48.899,00:42:50.192,Is that still okay?
00:42:50.901,00:42:52.903,-Okay. -Okay.
00:43:51.295,00:43:54.590,"Yeah, I'm fine. Just tired."
00:43:56.717,00:44:02.181,"Well, the sonogram is showing that you are about 18 weeks."
00:44:02.264,00:44:04.558,Does that sound about as far along as you thought?
00:44:04.642,00:44:09.772,"Uh, no, um… the place I went to before said that I was 10 weeks."
00:44:10.439,00:44:14.693,"Well, there can be some margin of error, but it's usually in the three to four-day range."
00:44:14.777,00:44:17.363,Which is why it's always important for us to do them again.
00:44:17.446,00:44:22.201,"Um, no, the… the sonogram I did before, they definitely said I was 10 weeks."
00:44:23.160,00:44:24.870,Where was that?
00:44:25.496,00:44:28.374,Back in my town.
00:44:28.457,00:44:30.668,I have a feeling that that was inaccurate.
00:44:33.045,00:44:40.427,"At this specific facility, in-clinic abortions are offered up to 12 weeks after the start date of your last menstrual period."
00:44:42.179,00:44:43.931,Then what am I supposed to do?
00:44:44.515,00:44:49.895,"I'm going to send you to our Manhattan facility, and they should be able to take you first thing tomorrow."
00:44:52.189,00:44:54.108,Can't you call and see if they'll take me now?
00:44:57.444,00:44:59.446,I really can't wait until then.
00:45:00.197,00:45:01.949,I just don't think it's gonna be possible.
00:45:02.658,00:45:06.537,But they are going to be able to give you the care that you need tomorrow.
00:45:06.620,00:45:08.122,It's gonna be okay.
00:46:24.990,00:46:26.283,Look at this.
00:46:30.245,00:46:31.455,Who's that?
00:46:32.039,00:46:33.957,You know.
00:46:34.541,00:46:36.084,It's that guy.
00:46:36.793,00:46:38.170,Don't encourage him.
00:46:38.253,00:46:39.671,I'm not.
00:46:40.714,00:46:43.550,He seriously texted me three times. Look.
00:46:43.634,00:46:45.719,-Did you write back? -No.
00:46:46.470,00:46:49.097,"Well, then delete, delete, delete."
00:46:55.938,00:46:57.648,You cannot sleep here.
00:46:57.731,00:47:00.901,This area's closed between the hours of 1 a.m. and 5:30 a.m.
00:48:22.190,00:48:24.526,Come on. Skylar.
00:51:15.030,00:51:16.782,It's called a French whore bath.
00:51:28.293,00:51:30.545,"Oh, pass. Pass."
00:51:30.629,00:51:31.546,I'm good.
00:51:45.519,00:51:46.937,Can I get one of those?
00:51:52.609,00:51:54.444,"Um, can I get one of these?"
00:51:57.948,00:51:59.658,"Can I get one of those, too?"
00:52:08.750,00:52:09.835,Here you go.
00:52:51.459,00:52:54.004,now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
00:52:58.049,00:53:05.015,"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen."
00:53:07.809,00:53:14.733,"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen."
00:53:15.442,00:53:44.429,"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners… Put your bags up."
00:54:09.162,00:54:10.288,Autumn?
00:54:24.469,00:54:26.179,Hi. Come on in.
00:54:30.934,00:54:32.978,"So, I'm your financial counselor."
00:54:33.061,00:54:36.022,I'll be helping you sort out the payment for today.
00:54:36.106,00:54:38.525,-Are you currently insured? -Yes.
00:54:38.608,00:54:40.944,Great. Can I see your insurance card?
00:54:54.124,00:54:55.250,Great.
00:54:56.334,00:55:00.171,"Oh, wait. Um… If I do this, would my parents get some kind of bill?"
00:55:01.756,00:55:04.134,They'd get a statement. That's correct.
00:55:05.260,00:55:08.346,"Um, is there anything else I can do?"
00:55:10.140,00:55:17.480,"Um, well, why don't we just figure out what you can pay, and then the rest, we can… figure out a way to supplement with private funds."
00:55:17.564,00:55:18.982,-All right? -Okay.
00:55:23.319,00:55:26.072,"Oh. Go ahead, and just hold on to that."
00:55:26.156,00:55:27.866,That'll be for downstairs for payment.
00:55:29.325,00:55:33.997,"All I need you to do is fill out this form, right here, and we'll get you started."
00:55:34.080,00:55:34.956,-Okay? -Okay.
00:55:52.474,00:55:55.477,-How are you doing? -Okay.
00:56:02.192,00:56:08.531,"So, you had a sonogram at the Planned Parenthood in Brooklyn, and the sonogram is showing that you're 18 weeks pregnant."
00:56:08.615,00:56:10.867,Is that about what you thought?
00:56:10.950,00:56:12.368,"Um, no."
00:56:12.452,00:56:14.496,"Okay, how many weeks did you think you were?"
00:56:14.579,00:56:17.707,-I thought I was 10 weeks. -10 weeks?
00:56:17.791,00:56:19.334,"Okay, that happens sometimes."
00:56:19.417,00:56:25.465,"Because you're 18 weeks, you're in the second trimester, this is gonna be a two-day procedure, okay?"
00:56:26.341,00:56:28.218,Is there any way you can do it all in one day?
00:56:28.301,00:56:32.097,"Unfortunately, it has to be done over the course of two days."
00:56:32.180,00:56:36.476,We have to put dilators in the cervix so that the cervix can open up slowly overnight.
00:56:36.559,00:56:39.646,"That way, the procedure can be done safely tomorrow."
00:56:40.522,00:56:42.565,Will you be able to come back tomorrow?
00:56:43.399,00:56:44.567,Yeah.
00:56:44.651,00:56:45.860,Okay.
00:56:46.653,00:56:52.117,I also need to know that you're absolutely sure of your decision to terminate this pregnancy.
00:56:53.326,00:56:54.828,Are you sure of your decision?
00:56:54.911,00:56:56.788,-Yeah. -Okay.
00:56:56.871,00:57:03.628,"'Cause if you, for any reason, change your mind, there could be serious medical considerations if you don't complete the second part of the procedure."
00:57:03.711,00:57:05.880,-Okay. -Okay?
00:57:05.964,00:57:08.091,Do you have a place to stay tonight?
00:57:08.174,00:57:11.386,"-I know you came from far away. -Yeah, yeah."
00:57:11.469,00:57:13.054,Where are you gonna stay?
00:57:13.638,00:57:16.724,I don't know. I was just gonna go to a hotel or something.
00:57:16.808,00:57:19.727,Okay. Hotels are pretty expensive.
00:57:19.811,00:57:21.688,Do you have the money for that?
00:57:23.565,00:57:27.485,We work with volunteers that can help you with a place to stay.
00:57:27.569,00:57:29.821,I can reach out to them if you want me to.
00:57:29.904,00:57:33.241,"-Yeah, I… I got it. It's fine. -Okay."
00:57:34.451,00:57:36.161,Who came with you today?
00:57:36.244,00:57:37.662,My cousin.
00:57:37.745,00:57:39.497,Have they been supportive?
00:57:39.581,00:57:41.249,-Yeah. -Okay.
00:57:41.332,00:57:45.211,Can you tell me what led to your decision to terminate the pregnancy?
00:57:46.504,00:57:49.090,I… I'm just not ready to be a mom.
00:57:49.174,00:57:50.800,That's totally fine.
00:57:50.884,00:57:54.762,Whatever your decision is is totally fine as long as it's yours.
00:57:56.848,00:58:01.102,Is there anyone who's pressuring you to be here today to terminate this pregnancy?
00:58:01.186,00:58:02.020,No.
00:58:02.645,00:58:03.897,Okay.
00:58:03.980,00:58:06.941,I'm gonna ask you some questions about your medical history.
00:58:07.525,00:58:08.776,Okay? There's lots of questions.
00:58:08.860,00:58:10.236,Just answer as best you can.
00:58:12.238,00:58:16.326,Do you take any medication or use any drugs on a regular basis?
00:58:16.409,00:58:20.788,-No. -Have you taken any medication or used any drugs of any kind today?
00:58:20.872,00:58:21.873,No.
00:58:21.956,00:58:28.963,"Have you ever had any medical problems before, like anemia, asthma, high blood pressure, anything like that?"
00:58:29.631,00:58:31.132,I don't know. Don't think so.
00:58:31.216,00:58:32.383,Okay.
00:58:32.467,00:58:34.594,Are you allergic to any medication?
00:58:34.677,00:58:36.012,-No. -No?
00:58:36.095,00:58:39.307,You have any allergies to latex or shellfish?

00:58:50.318,00:58:55.823,"Anyone in your family have any major illness, like cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure?"
00:58:55.907,00:59:01.079,"-Parents, grandparents? -Uh… -No, not that I know of. -Okay."
00:59:01.162,00:59:03.289,And do you have a healthy diet?
00:59:04.123,00:59:05.792,I think so.
00:59:05.875,00:59:08.628,Kind of? Do you exercise regularly?
00:59:08.711,00:59:10.338,-Not really. -Okay.
00:59:10.421,00:59:12.549,-Do you use seat belts? -Yeah.
00:59:12.632,00:59:13.716,"Okay, good."

00:59:19.556,00:59:21.474,Any health hazards at home?
00:59:22.517,00:59:23.518,Not really.
00:59:23.601,00:59:25.603,When was the last time you went to the doctor?
00:59:25.687,00:59:28.731,"Uh, like, a year ago."
00:59:28.815,00:59:29.816,Okay.
00:59:30.733,00:59:32.819,And at what age did you first have sex?
00:59:34.821,00:59:37.115,"-Uh, 14. -Okay."
00:59:37.198,00:59:39.284,And what types of sexual activity have you had?

00:59:44.872,00:59:47.667,And how many sexual partners do you currently have?

00:59:50.169,00:59:53.381,And could your partner have any other partners that you're aware of?
00:59:53.464,00:59:55.758,-Probably. -Okay.
00:59:55.842,00:59:59.387,And how many sexual partners have you had in the last 12 months?
00:59:59.470,01:00:01.014,"Uh, two."
01:00:01.097,01:00:02.557,How about in your lifetime?
01:00:02.640,01:00:04.976,-Six. -Okay.
01:00:05.059,01:00:10.690,Do you use any condoms or any other barriers to protect yourself against HIV or other infections?
01:00:10.773,01:00:12.358,-Mm-hm. -Yeah?
01:00:12.442,01:00:14.068,"Okay, good."
01:00:16.529,01:00:20.241,"I want to spend a few minutes talking with you about your relationships, okay?"
01:00:20.325,01:00:21.909,Because they can affect your health.
01:00:21.993,01:00:23.244,Did you know that?
01:00:23.328,01:00:24.996,No? All right.
01:00:25.079,01:00:27.290,So I'm gonna ask you some questions.
01:00:27.373,01:00:29.208,They can be really personal.
01:00:29.292,01:00:34.464,"And all you have to do is answer either never, rarely, sometimes, or always."
01:00:34.547,01:00:37.175,"It's kind of like multiple choice, but it's not a test."
01:00:37.759,01:00:39.719,-Okay. -Okay?
01:00:39.802,01:00:44.807,"In the past year, your partner has refused to wear a condom."
01:00:44.891,01:00:50.313,"Never, rarely, sometimes, always."
01:00:51.356,01:00:54.025,"Um, sometimes."
01:00:54.108,01:00:55.068,Okay.
01:00:55.151,01:01:00.198,And your partner messes with your birth control or tries to get you pregnant when you don't want to be.
01:01:07.038,01:01:08.831,"Uh, never."
01:01:08.915,01:01:10.083,Okay.
01:01:10.166,01:01:12.794,Your partner has threatened or frightened you.
01:01:12.877,01:01:19.258,"Never, rarely, sometimes, always."
01:01:20.051,01:01:21.761,Why are you asking me this?
01:01:22.845,01:01:24.931,I want to make sure that you're safe.
01:01:27.558,01:01:37.902,"Your partner's threatened or frightened you/ Never, rarely, sometimes, always."
01:01:38.528,01:01:40.905,"Um, rarely."
01:01:40.988,01:01:42.365,Okay.
01:01:42.448,01:01:46.035,"Your partner has hit you, slapped you, or physically hurt you."
01:01:47.161,01:01:53.626,"Never, rarely, sometimes, always."
01:02:00.091,01:02:04.137,"Has your partner ever hit you, slapped you, or physically hurt you?"
01:02:09.350,01:02:10.852,Is someone hurting you?
01:02:15.231,01:02:16.733,It's okay.
01:02:19.026,01:02:21.237,"It's just a couple more questions, all right?"
01:02:22.947,01:02:26.200,Your partner has made you have sex when you didn't want to.
01:02:27.076,01:02:33.624,"Never, rarely, sometimes, always."
01:02:38.546,01:02:40.006,It's okay.
01:02:47.472,01:02:50.683,"I want to make sure you're safe, and I want to help you if I can."
01:02:58.065,01:03:00.985,"I have just one more question for you, okay, Autumn?"
01:03:02.278,01:03:05.740,Has anyone forced you into a sexual act ever in your lifetime?
01:03:05.823,01:03:06.866,Yes or no?
01:03:11.746,01:03:12.747,Okay.
01:03:13.664,01:03:14.957,Do you want to tell me about it?
01:03:15.041,01:03:17.627,"-No, not… -It's okay."
01:03:18.544,01:03:22.089,"I'm gonna give you my number, and you can call me."
01:03:23.007,01:03:27.929,"We don't have to talk about it today, but you can call me if you need to talk or if you need some help, okay?"
01:03:36.604,01:03:38.272,Do you have any questions for me?
01:03:40.566,01:03:44.028,"Is it… the procedure, is it gonna be painful?"
01:03:44.111,01:03:46.239,It's gonna be a little uncomfortable.
01:03:46.322,01:03:48.699,Have you ever had a GYN exam before?
01:03:48.783,01:03:50.493,-No. -Okay.
01:03:51.369,01:03:53.287,It's gonna be in an operating room.
01:03:53.371,01:03:55.915,There's gonna be a doctor. There's gonna be a nurse.
01:03:55.998,01:03:57.917,There's gonna be a medical assistant.
01:03:58.793,01:04:01.003,I can be there with you if you want me to be.
01:04:01.087,01:04:02.922,Would you like me to go with you?
01:04:03.005,01:04:04.715,-Sure. -Okay.
01:04:05.633,01:04:08.678,"Okay, so it's kind of like having a GYN exam today."
01:04:08.761,01:04:11.264,They're gonna put a speculum in the vagina.
01:04:12.014,01:04:16.978,"They're gonna put laminaria into the cervix, and that's what's gonna help the cervix open overnight."
01:04:17.603,01:04:23.067,"All right, so it's gonna feel uncomfortable, kind of like pressure, kind of like you have to pee, but it shouldn't hurt."
01:04:25.111,01:04:28.614,"If you have any really bad pain tonight, you have to call us."
01:04:28.698,01:04:30.575,-Okay. -Okay?
01:04:31.576,01:04:36.706,"Then, when you come back tomorrow for the second part of the procedure, for that part, you're gonna be asleep."
01:04:37.540,01:04:39.625,"Okay, and I can be with you then, too."
01:04:40.376,01:04:41.878,"I'm gonna, like, go under?"
01:04:41.961,01:04:44.005,-Mm-hm. -Okay.
01:04:44.088,01:04:45.965,Just for about ten minutes.
01:04:46.048,01:04:48.342,"-It's pretty quick, all right? -Okay."
01:04:48.426,01:04:51.262,"And then, when you wake up, you'll be in the recovery room."
01:04:51.345,01:04:53.598,You're gonna be all done. Then you can go home.
01:04:53.681,01:04:55.766,-Okay. -All right.
01:04:55.850,01:04:57.018,Are you ready?
01:04:57.894,01:05:00.438,-Think so. -Okay.
01:07:45.728,01:07:47.980,I had to use it all for the appointment.
01:08:20.429,01:08:22.264,Why couldn't they do it all today?
01:08:24.809,01:08:26.977,You can go home if you want.
01:08:49.083,01:08:51.043,"Um, I'm sorry."
01:08:51.127,01:08:55.381,"We lost our tickets, and we were wondering, is there any way that you could reprint them for us?"
01:08:55.464,01:08:56.841,Do you have a receipt?
01:09:00.553,01:09:03.597,I can't reissue the tickets without proof of purchase.
01:09:03.681,01:09:04.640,Okay.
01:09:04.723,01:09:09.645,"Um, how much for two tickets, then, to Ellensboro, Pennsylvania?"
01:09:14.984,01:09:16.193,Thank you.
01:09:30.875,01:09:32.209,Do you want me to call my mom?
01:09:32.835,01:09:33.794,No.
01:09:37.173,01:09:38.841,Do you want me to call your mom?
01:09:39.633,01:09:40.759,No.
01:09:44.847,01:09:46.557,Then what do you want me to do?
01:09:47.766,01:09:49.143,Fuck off.
01:11:37.418,01:11:38.711,Oh.
01:12:05.237,01:12:06.905,Look at me.
01:12:41.940,01:12:44.276,-Hey. -Hey.
01:12:46.945,01:12:48.614,"How was, uh, your family thing?"
01:12:49.281,01:12:50.616,It was okay.
01:12:55.746,01:12:56.955,We were pretty busy.
01:12:59.458,01:13:01.502,Want to come with me to this thing downtown?
01:13:01.585,01:13:05.923,"Um, we actually kind of need to hang around here, if that's okay."
01:13:06.882,01:13:10.177,"Okay. Uh, well, let's get a drink."
01:13:13.263,01:13:14.848,How old are you?
01:13:14.932,01:13:16.183,20.
01:13:17.518,01:13:24.983,"Okay, well, no one really cards in New York, so… Um, if we can just grab a bite to eat in here, if that's okay."
01:13:33.742,01:13:36.245,-We're good. -Okay.
01:13:37.621,01:13:40.958,It's always so embarrassing to eat in front of people you don't really know.
01:13:41.041,01:13:43.293,It's even worse when you're the only one eating.
01:13:43.377,01:13:45.462,"We just ate, but thanks."
01:13:48.507,01:13:50.884,"So, the show was, like, super fun."
01:13:52.511,01:13:55.222,It was more like an event than a show.
01:13:55.305,01:13:59.184,"It was in, um, an abandoned subway station."
01:13:59.268,01:14:00.853,Sure you don't want to come check it out?
01:14:06.275,01:14:08.694,"I mean, this city has a lot of secrets."
01:14:13.282,01:14:14.867,"Go ahead, just take some."
01:14:14.950,01:14:15.784,As many as you want.
01:14:19.580,01:14:21.290,Where you from exactly?
01:14:22.040,01:14:23.417,Pennsylvania.
01:14:23.500,01:14:25.210,Northumberland County.
01:14:26.545,01:14:27.754,Sounds exciting.
01:14:28.672,01:14:30.924,What do you like to do there?
01:14:31.008,01:14:32.718,Normal things.
01:14:32.801,01:14:34.303,Like?
01:14:34.386,01:14:36.221,"School, work."
01:14:37.139,01:14:39.808,Sounds like a fascinating place.
01:14:40.934,01:14:43.187,"Yeah, it's… it's nice."
01:14:46.940,01:14:49.860,Sure you don't want to come with me downtown?
01:14:51.236,01:14:53.155,We really can't.
01:14:55.616,01:14:56.742,Okay.
01:15:28.482,01:15:30.776,-We can squeeze you in. Yeah. -Perfect.
01:15:30.859,01:15:32.861,"-Uh, how many players today? -Three."
01:15:34.863,01:15:37.199,-I got it. -Thanks.
01:16:15.737,01:16:16.989,You're starting out killing it.
01:16:17.072,01:16:18.532,You hustling me?
01:16:32.296,01:16:33.797,You good?
01:16:36.800,01:16:38.719,Should I order a pitcher of beer?
01:16:39.928,01:16:41.763,Just water will be fine.
01:16:43.015,01:16:44.766,Will you drink with me?
01:17:55.962,01:17:57.214,Autumn?
01:17:57.923,01:17:59.549,Mom?
01:17:59.633,01:18:01.968,Are you okay?
01:18:03.762,01:18:04.971,Where are you?
01:18:11.269,01:18:12.979,Are you there?
01:19:21.298,01:19:23.175,"Ooh, Springsteen. That's cool."
01:19:26.803,01:19:30.056,I really don't do karaoke unless I'm really drunk.
01:21:06.278,01:21:09.531,"What, um… What time is your bus?"
01:21:10.365,01:21:15.078,"I'm sorry, this is really awkward, but, um… can we ask you something?"
01:21:18.456,01:21:25.589,"We lost our bus tickets, and it got super late, and we don't have anyone to call."
01:21:25.672,01:21:29.009,Could we… borrow a few bucks?
01:21:30.802,01:21:33.305,"No, no problem. I mean, yeah. Sure."
01:21:34.931,01:21:40.562,"Just, uh… just come with me downtown, and we can stop at an ATM on the way."
01:21:42.063,01:21:44.232,I wish we could.
01:21:44.316,01:21:48.904,"Sounds great, but… we're really just cutting it too close with our bus."
01:21:54.743,01:22:02.834,"Um… I mean, everything's closed, so… Yeah."
01:22:06.212,01:22:07.631,Okay. Yeah.
01:22:07.714,01:22:10.050,And you're probably tired of lugging that thing around.
01:22:17.057,01:22:18.058,Okay.
01:22:21.436,01:22:23.021,Okay.
01:26:01.114,01:26:03.408,-Here you go. -Thank you.
01:26:09.247,01:26:11.583,"Um, we'll get you back."
01:26:13.710,01:26:18.131,"I'll, uh… -I'll text you. -Yeah."
01:27:26.199,01:27:27.700,Want to see a trick?
01:27:30.328,01:27:31.704,Sure.
01:27:31.788,01:27:33.414,"Look at this, okay?"
01:28:10.118,01:28:11.077,I'm okay.
01:28:11.160,01:28:14.622,"Any pain, cramping, bleeding overnight?"
01:28:16.624,01:28:18.751,"-Nothing too bad. -Okay, good."
01:28:18.835,01:28:21.337,And anything to eat or drink since midnight?
01:28:21.421,01:28:22.505,No.
01:28:22.588,01:28:24.549,"Okay. You must be hungry, right?"
01:28:24.632,01:28:25.758,-Yeah. -Okay.
01:28:25.842,01:28:27.510,You can eat as soon as you're done.
01:28:27.593,01:28:30.013,-Great. -Okay.
01:28:30.096,01:28:32.557,I also want to make a follow-up appointment for you.
01:28:32.640,01:28:35.101,"Oh, um, do I have to come back?"
01:28:35.184,01:28:36.728,"No, you don't have to come back here."
01:28:36.811,01:28:38.438,I know you live far away.
01:28:38.521,01:28:42.025,But I would like to help you make an appointment somewhere closer to home.
01:28:42.859,01:28:43.901,Okay?
01:28:44.861,01:28:45.862,"Yeah, sure."
01:28:45.945,01:28:46.946,Okay.
01:28:48.823,01:28:49.866,You ready?
01:28:52.785,01:28:55.455,"-I think so. Yeah, yeah. -Okay. Okay."
01:29:25.943,01:29:27.528,and what procedure you're having?
01:29:30.615,01:29:33.076,"Um, my name is Autumn Callahan."
01:29:34.327,01:29:36.496,"August 19, 2002."
01:29:37.997,01:29:39.791,And what did you just ask me?
01:29:40.875,01:29:42.710,What procedure are you having?
01:29:45.254,01:29:47.090,"Uh, I'm having an abortion."
01:29:48.341,01:29:50.093,Do you have any questions before we start?
01:29:50.176,01:29:51.344,No.
01:30:52.405,01:30:53.322,Thanks.
01:31:15.511,01:31:17.513,-You okay? -Yeah.
01:31:20.516,01:31:21.642,"So, should we go?"
01:31:22.518,01:31:23.644,Mm-hm.
01:32:06.938,01:32:08.105,"So, how was it?"
01:32:10.233,01:32:11.651,What do you mean?
01:32:17.573,01:32:19.325,It was kind of whatever.
01:32:21.577,01:32:22.870,Were they nice?
01:32:26.832,01:32:28.042,Nice enough.
01:32:32.421,01:32:33.881,Did it hurt?
01:32:36.175,01:32:37.677,Just uncomfortable.
01:32:42.181,01:32:43.641,How do you feel now?
01:32:47.311,01:32:48.145,Tired.
01:33:05.204,01:33:07.540,"-Yeah, roly-poly. -Yeah."
01:33:16.215,01:33:17.758,And probably bad for your health.
01:33:17.842,01:33:20.136,"Oh, yeah, so it's good for the soul."
01:33:20.219,01:33:22.805,"It's kind of all that grease, you know."
01:33:22.888,01:33:24.265,All that grease.
