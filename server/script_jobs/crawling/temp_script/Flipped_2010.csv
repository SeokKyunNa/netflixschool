00:00:50.875,00:00:54.208,"It all began in the summer of 1957, before the start of second grade."
00:00:54.250,00:00:56.166,STEVEN: Here we are.
00:00:56.208,00:00:58.333,-What do you guys think?
00:00:58.375,00:01:00.834,BRYCE: It's cool.
00:01:00.875,00:01:02.834,Just you wait.
00:01:02.875,00:01:05.417,BRYCE: Let's see what's inside.
00:01:05.458,00:01:08.250,"Why don't, uh, you and I go help unload the van..."
00:01:08.291,00:01:12.000,...and the womenfolk here can get in the kitchen and start setting up.
00:01:12.041,00:01:14.125,"Okay, Dad."
00:01:14.166,00:01:16.458,"BRYCE: For me, it was the beginning of what would be..."
00:01:16.500,00:01:21.625,...more than half a decade of strategic avoidance and social discomfort.
00:01:21.667,00:01:24.542,"-Hi, I'm Juli Baker."
00:01:24.583,00:01:26.000,Don't you want some help?
00:01:26.041,00:01:28.208,No. There's some valuable things in there.
00:01:28.250,00:01:31.250,-How about this one?
00:01:31.291,00:01:34.166,Run home. Your mother's probably wondering where you are.
00:01:34.208,00:01:37.041,"Oh, no, my mom knows where I am."
00:01:37.083,00:01:39.959,BRYCE: It didn't take long to realize this girl could not take a hint.
00:01:40.000,00:01:42.625,-It's crowded in here with three people.
00:01:42.667,00:01:45.458,BRYCE: Of any kind.
00:01:47.041,00:01:50.375,"Bryce, isn't it time for you to go help your mother?"
00:01:50.417,00:01:51.792,Huh?
00:01:52.834,00:01:55.208,"Oh, yeah."
00:01:55.250,00:01:57.792,"BRYCE: I mean, nothing would stop her."
00:01:57.834,00:02:01.625,I was about to tell her to get lost when the weirdest thing happened.
00:02:06.333,00:02:08.083,I couldn't believe it.
00:02:08.125,00:02:12.000,There I was holding hands with this strange girl.
00:02:12.041,00:02:14.458,-How did I get into this mess?
00:02:15.792,00:02:18.333,-I see you've met my son.
00:02:18.375,00:02:23.709,"BRYCE: Finally, I did the only manly thing available when you're 7 years old."
00:02:29.709,00:02:33.333,"However, my troubles were far from over."
00:02:33.375,00:02:35.917,The minute I walked into Miss Yelson's classroom...
00:02:35.959,00:02:38.583,Bryce? You're here.
00:02:38.625,00:02:42.709,BRYCE: ...it was clear: School would not be a sanctuary.
00:02:44.542,00:02:47.041,"Hey, Bryce, where's your girlfriend?"
00:02:47.083,00:02:49.333,BRYCE: I was branded for life.
00:02:49.375,00:02:53.750,"Hey, Bryce, why don't you ask her to marry you?"
00:02:53.792,00:03:02.792,Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G BRYCE: My first year in town was a disaster.
00:03:02.834,00:03:04.500,GIRL: Look at them.
00:03:04.542,00:03:06.291,BRYCE: And the next three weren't much better.
00:03:06.333,00:03:09.417,"But finally, in the sixth grade, I took action."
00:03:09.458,00:03:11.667,I hatched the plan.
00:03:11.709,00:03:13.125,Sherry.
00:03:14.166,00:03:16.375,"Sherry, wait up."
00:03:16.417,00:03:17.834,"Hi, Bryce. Heh."
00:03:17.875,00:03:19.333,BRYCE: I asked out Sherry Stalls.
00:03:19.375,00:03:21.375,I was wondering if you wanted to go....
00:03:21.417,00:03:24.000,BRYCE: To full appreciate the brilliance of this plan...
00:03:24.041,00:03:27.417,...you have to understand that Juli hated Sherry Stalls...
00:03:27.458,00:03:29.250,...though I never understood why.
00:03:29.291,00:03:32.625,"Sherry was nice, friendly and she had a lot of hair."
00:03:32.667,00:03:36.166,"At first, my mother wouldn't let me get my ears pierced, but I begged...."
00:03:36.208,00:03:38.917,BRYCE: The idea was that Sherry would eat with me...
00:03:38.959,00:03:42.583,"...maybe we'd walk around together, and hopefully Juli would lose interest."
00:03:42.625,00:03:44.834,But I still can't get the hoops till I'm 16.
00:03:44.875,00:03:46.834,"Oh, that's a shame."
00:03:46.875,00:03:49.750,"So Melanie wanted to get her ears pierced, but of course her mother said no."
00:03:49.792,00:03:54.750,So she threw a fit and smashed her Johnny Mathis Greatest Hits album...
00:03:57.125,00:04:00.333,"...and she got grounded, so now she can't come to my pajama sleepover party."
00:04:00.375,00:04:03.250,BRYCE: Things were unfolding quite nicely.
00:04:03.291,00:04:05.834,What are you doing for your science project?
00:04:05.875,00:04:09.417,"BRYCE: That is, until my supposed best friend, Garrett Einbinder..."
00:04:09.458,00:04:12.000,...took an interest in Sherry himself.
00:04:12.041,00:04:15.417,I was thinking of showing how split ends react with different hair conditioners.
00:04:15.458,00:04:17.583,That's fascinating.
00:04:17.625,00:04:19.750,"BRYCE: Loyalty gave way to desire and Garrett, the turncoat..."
00:04:19.792,00:04:21.625,...told Sherry what I was up to.
00:04:21.667,00:04:23.000,SHERRY: Jerk.
00:04:23.041,00:04:25.875,BRYCE: She didn't take it well.
00:04:25.917,00:04:29.917,"Word got back to Juli, and pretty soon she started up with the goo-goo eyes again."
00:04:29.959,00:04:31.959,Only this time it was worse.
00:04:32.041,00:04:34.750,She started sniffing me.
00:04:34.792,00:04:37.291,"That's right, sniffing me."
00:04:37.333,00:04:39.500,What was that all about?
00:04:39.542,00:04:41.917,My only consolation was that next year would be different.
00:04:41.959,00:04:44.583,"Junior high, bigger school."
00:04:44.625,00:04:50.083,"Maybe we'd be in different classes and it would finally, finally be over."
00:04:50.125,00:04:54.291,"JULI: The first day I met Bryce Loski, I flipped."
00:04:54.333,00:04:58.250,"It was those eyes, something in those dazzling eyes."
00:04:58.291,00:05:00.792,You wanna push this one together?
00:05:00.834,00:05:03.250,JULI: His family had just moved into the neighborhood...
00:05:03.291,00:05:06.000,...and I'd gone over to help them.
00:05:06.041,00:05:09.417,I'd been in the van all of two minutes when his dad sent him off to help his mom.
00:05:09.458,00:05:12.333,I could see he didn't wanna go.
00:05:12.375,00:05:16.125,So I chased after him to see if we could play a little before he got trapped inside.
00:05:17.875,00:05:20.208,"The next thing I know, he's holding my hand..."
00:05:20.250,00:05:23.208,...and looking right into my eyes.
00:05:23.250,00:05:24.750,My heart stopped.
00:05:24.792,00:05:26.417,Was this it?
00:05:26.458,00:05:29.166,Would this be my first kiss?
00:05:29.208,00:05:32.208,-But then his mother came out.
00:05:32.250,00:05:37.000,"JULI: And he was so embarrassed, his cheeks turned completely red."
00:05:37.041,00:05:40.542,I went to bed that night thinking of the kiss that might have been.
00:05:40.583,00:05:45.542,"I mean, it was clear he had feelings for me, but he was just too shy to show them."
00:05:45.583,00:05:48.375,My mother said boys were like that.
00:05:48.417,00:05:51.875,-So I decided to help him out.
00:05:54.250,00:05:57.041,JULI: I would give him plenty of opportunity to get over his shyness.
00:05:57.083,00:06:00.500,"By the sixth grade, I'd learned to control myself."
00:06:00.542,00:06:03.792,Then Sherry Stalls entered the picture.
00:06:03.834,00:06:07.875,"Sherry Stalls was nothing but a whiny, gossipy, backstabbing flirt."
00:06:07.917,00:06:09.875,All hair and no substance.
00:06:09.917,00:06:11.250,And there she was...
00:06:11.291,00:06:14.291,...holding hands with Bryce. My Bryce.
00:06:14.333,00:06:17.000,The one who was walking around with my first kiss.
00:06:17.041,00:06:20.291,My solution was to ignore her.
00:06:20.333,00:06:23.959,...would eventually see through a shallow conniver like Sherry Stalls.
00:06:24.000,00:06:27.083,It took all of a week.
00:06:28.500,00:06:31.625,She didn't take it well.
00:06:31.667,00:06:35.458,"Now that Bryce was out of Sherry's evil clutches, he started being nicer to me."
00:06:35.500,00:06:38.333,"-Hi, Juli."
00:06:38.375,00:06:41.125,JULI: He was so shy and so cute...
00:06:41.166,00:06:43.834,"...and his hair, it smelled like watermelon."
00:06:43.875,00:06:45.792,I couldn't get enough of it.
00:06:45.834,00:06:48.667,I spent the whole year secretly sniffing watermelon...
00:06:48.709,00:06:52.000,...and wondering if I was ever going to get my kiss.
00:06:55.166,00:06:57.417,"BRYCE: Seventh grade brought changes, all right."
00:06:57.458,00:06:59.709,But the biggest one didn't happen at school.
00:06:59.750,00:07:01.667,It happened at home.
00:07:01.709,00:07:04.375,My grandfather came to live with us.
00:07:11.750,00:07:14.917,Mom said he stared like that because he missed Grandma.
00:07:14.959,00:07:18.875,That was not something Grandpa would ever talk about with me.
00:07:18.917,00:07:23.375,"As a matter of fact, he never talked about much of anything with me."
00:07:23.417,00:07:26.375,"That is, until Juli appeared in the local newspaper."
00:07:26.417,00:07:29.875,"-Oh, Bryce. May I speak with you?"
00:07:29.917,00:07:30.959,"Have a seat, son."
00:07:36.083,00:07:38.667,Tell me about your friend Juli Baker.
00:07:38.709,00:07:41.166,Juli. She's not exactly my friend.
00:07:41.208,00:07:43.250,Oh. Why's that?
00:07:44.375,00:07:47.291,Why do you wanna know?
00:07:47.333,00:07:50.375,"BRYCE: Now, Juli Baker did not wind up in The Mayfield Times ..."
00:07:50.417,00:07:53.125,...for being an eighth-grade Einstein.
00:07:53.166,00:07:58.000,"No, she got front-page coverage because she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree."
00:07:58.041,00:08:01.250,Juli Baker and that stupid sycamore tree.
00:08:01.291,00:08:04.834,She always thought it was God's gift to our little corner of the universe.
00:08:04.875,00:08:08.333,"Hey, Bryce. Wanna come climb the tree with me and my brothers?"
00:08:08.375,00:08:10.083,"No, thanks."
00:08:10.125,00:08:13.041,Bryce. Come up here. It's fun.
00:08:13.083,00:08:15.834,-You can see everything.
00:08:15.875,00:08:20.959,My dad needs me to help him fix...
00:08:22.083,00:08:24.125,...a thing.
00:08:24.166,00:08:25.458,BRYCE: That's all I needed.
00:08:25.500,00:08:27.834,Climb up a tree with Juli Baker.
00:08:27.875,00:08:30.458,I'd be dragged right back into the second grade.
00:08:30.500,00:08:32.875,Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree.
00:08:32.917,00:08:36.875,Why don't you just make me eat lima beans for the rest of my life.
00:08:36.917,00:08:38.750,JULI: It's three blocks away.
00:08:40.542,00:08:41.667,Two blocks.
00:08:45.458,00:08:47.417,One block away.
00:08:47.458,00:08:50.250,-Like that's valuable information.
00:08:50.291,00:08:53.291,I like to think there's at least a chance the bus won't show.
00:08:55.375,00:08:58.917,I think the tree looks particularly beautiful in this light. Don't you?
00:08:58.959,00:09:02.417,"If by beautiful you mean unbelievably ugly, then, yes, I would agree."
00:09:06.500,00:09:10.875,You're just visually challenged.
00:09:10.917,00:09:12.959,BRYCE: Visually challenged?
00:09:13.000,00:09:15.667,Visually challenged?
00:09:15.709,00:09:19.208,This from the girl who lived in a house that was the joke of the neighborhood?
00:09:19.250,00:09:23.667,They had bushes growing over windows and weeds all over the place.
00:09:23.709,00:09:25.917,It bugged my dad bigtime.
00:09:25.959,00:09:28.375,"Oh, there he is."
00:09:28.417,00:09:31.750,The bricklayer who thinks he's a painter. That truck's not ugly enough in real life?
00:09:31.792,00:09:33.458,He's gotta make a painting of it?
00:09:33.500,00:09:36.709,"No, he does landscapes."
00:09:36.750,00:09:38.458,People say they're beautiful.
00:09:38.500,00:09:41.375,Landscapes? Let me tell you something.
00:09:41.417,00:09:43.625,The world would have more beauty in it...
00:09:43.667,00:09:47.542,...if he'd do a little landscaping on that piece of crap he calls a yard.
00:09:47.583,00:09:50.709,PATSY: I feel bad for his wife.
00:09:50.750,00:09:54.250,"Because of that, one of the two of them will always be unhappy."
00:09:54.291,00:09:58.291,"Yeah, fine."
00:09:58.333,00:10:00.667,BRYCE: As annoying as the yard was to my dad...
00:10:00.709,00:10:04.041,...it was nothing compared to how annoying Juli Baker was in that tree.
00:10:04.083,00:10:06.125,JULI: Three blocks away.
00:10:06.166,00:10:08.291,BRYCE: Every morning we had to listen to the sound...
00:10:08.333,00:10:10.500,...of her blow-by-blow traffic report.
00:10:10.542,00:10:11.959,JULI: Two blocks.
00:10:12.000,00:10:13.458,WOMAN: There you go.
00:10:13.500,00:10:15.375,Why do they call it The Three Stooges?
00:10:15.417,00:10:17.625,"-I mean, there's five of them."
00:10:17.667,00:10:21.208,"Well, yeah, there's Moe, Larry, Curly, Shemp and Curly Joe."
00:10:21.250,00:10:24.291,"-Yeah, but they only have three at a time."
00:10:24.333,00:10:27.667,"You know, I hate Curly Joe."
00:10:27.709,00:10:30.834,"MAN: Listen, girl, I'm this close to calling the police."
00:10:30.875,00:10:33.792,You are trespassing and obstructing progress on a contracted job.
00:10:33.834,00:10:36.166,GARRETT: What's going on?
00:10:36.208,00:10:39.709,-...or we're gonna cut you down.
00:10:39.750,00:10:41.875,They won't cut it down if we're all up here.
00:10:41.917,00:10:44.083,"-Bus, bus, bus."
00:10:44.125,00:10:46.458,They wanted to cut down her tree.
00:10:46.500,00:10:49.125,I couldn't understand why that mutant tangle of gnarly branches...
00:10:49.166,00:10:52.250,-...meant so much to her.
00:10:52.291,00:10:54.166,BRYCE: I felt bad for her.
00:10:54.208,00:10:56.208,BRYCE: But I wasn't about to cut school over it.
00:10:56.250,00:10:58.542,"GARRETT: Come on, bro."
00:10:58.583,00:11:00.625,"CHET: Why isn't she your friend, Bryce?"
00:11:02.250,00:11:03.709,You'd have to know Juli.
00:11:03.750,00:11:05.542,"Well, I'd like to."
00:11:05.583,00:11:07.291,Why?
00:11:07.333,00:11:09.625,That girl has an iron backbone.
00:11:09.667,00:11:12.000,Why don't you invite her over sometime?
00:11:12.041,00:11:13.875,An iron backbone?
00:11:13.917,00:11:15.583,She's just stubborn...
00:11:15.625,00:11:17.959,...and she's pushy beyond belief.
00:11:18.000,00:11:19.500,Is that so?
00:11:19.542,00:11:22.500,And she's been stalking me since the second grade.
00:11:22.542,00:11:25.792,"Well, a girl like that doesn't live next door to everyone."
00:11:25.834,00:11:27.125,Lucky them.
00:11:28.750,00:11:30.458,Read this.
00:11:30.500,00:11:31.583,Without prejudice.
00:11:37.166,00:11:40.625,BRYCE: Like I needed to know anything more about Juli Baker.
00:11:42.458,00:11:45.041,Juli wasn't at the bus stop the next morning.
00:11:46.458,00:11:48.375,Or the morning after that.
00:11:48.417,00:11:50.542,"She was at school, but you'd never know it."
00:11:50.583,00:11:53.500,-Little Joe? He's got so much makeup on-- -He doesn't age.
00:11:53.542,00:11:55.834,BRYCE: I told myself I should be glad about it.
00:11:55.875,00:11:58.208,"I mean, isn't that what I'd always wanted?"
00:11:58.250,00:12:02.375,"But still, I felt bad for her."
00:12:02.417,00:12:05.917,"I was gonna tell her I was sorry, but then I thought, hey, no..."
00:12:05.959,00:12:10.208,...that's the last thing I needed: Juli Baker thinking I missed her.
00:12:14.208,00:12:16.917,I see why you like to come out here.
00:12:16.959,00:12:19.583,Would you mind explaining it to your mother?
00:12:19.625,00:12:21.709,JULI: I loved to watch my father paint.
00:12:21.750,00:12:24.750,"Or really, I loved to hear him talk while he painted."
00:12:24.792,00:12:27.291,I learned a lot about my dad that way.
00:12:27.333,00:12:30.375,He told me all sorts of things...
00:12:30.417,00:12:33.458,...like how he got his first job delivering hay and how he'd wished he'd finished college.
00:12:33.500,00:12:35.583,Then one day he surprised me.
00:12:35.625,00:12:39.959,"What's going on with you and, uh, Bryce Loski?"
00:12:41.542,00:12:43.291,What do you mean? Nothing.
00:12:43.333,00:12:45.291,"Oh, okay."
00:12:45.333,00:12:47.333,My mistake.
00:12:47.375,00:12:49.291,Why would you even think that?
00:12:49.333,00:12:51.125,No reason.
00:12:51.166,00:12:53.625,Just that you...
00:12:53.667,00:12:55.250,...talk about him all the time.
00:12:56.375,00:12:58.333,I do?
00:12:58.375,00:13:00.250,Mm-hm.
00:13:02.667,00:13:04.166,I don't know.
00:13:05.667,00:13:08.250,I guess it's something about his eyes.
00:13:09.291,00:13:10.709,Or maybe his smile.
00:13:11.792,00:13:13.625,But what about him?
00:13:13.667,00:13:17.208,-What?
00:13:18.208,00:13:20.166,What does that mean?
00:13:20.208,00:13:23.500,A painting is more than the sum of its parts.
00:13:24.667,00:13:28.333,A cow by itself is just a cow.
00:13:28.375,00:13:33.959,"A meadow by itself is just grass, flowers."
00:13:34.041,00:13:39.208,And the sun peeking through the trees is just a beam of light.
00:13:39.250,00:13:41.959,But you put them all together...
00:13:42.000,00:13:45.667,...and it can be magic.
00:13:45.709,00:13:48.959,JULI: I didn't really understand what he was saying until one afternoon...
00:13:49.000,00:13:51.875,...when I was up in the sycamore tree.
00:13:51.917,00:13:53.959,I was rescuing a kite.
00:13:54.000,00:13:57.875,"It was a long way up, higher than I'd ever been."
00:13:57.917,00:14:02.000,"And the higher I got, the more amazed I was by the view."
00:14:02.041,00:14:04.875,I began to notice how wonderful the breeze smelled.
00:14:04.917,00:14:08.250,Like sunshine and wild grass.
00:14:08.291,00:14:10.792,I couldn't stop breathing it in...
00:14:10.834,00:14:13.750,...filling my lungs with the sweetest smell I'd ever known.
00:14:14.875,00:14:16.375,"Hey, you found my kite."
00:14:16.417,00:14:19.792,"Bryce, you should come up here."
00:14:19.834,00:14:21.583,It's so beautiful.
00:14:21.625,00:14:25.458,"I can't. I sprained my, um...."
00:14:25.500,00:14:27.917,I have a rash.
00:14:27.959,00:14:30.959,"JULI: From that moment on, that became my spot."
00:14:32.583,00:14:36.375,"I could sit there for hours, just looking out at the world."
00:14:36.417,00:14:38.834,Some days the sunsets would be purple and pink.
00:14:38.875,00:14:42.792,And some days they were a blazing orange...
00:14:42.834,00:14:45.750,...setting fire to the clouds on the horizon.
00:14:45.792,00:14:48.625,It was during one of those sunsets that my father's idea...
00:14:48.667,00:14:51.542,...of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts...
00:14:51.583,00:14:55.500,...moved from my head to my heart.
00:14:55.542,00:14:58.959,Some days I would get there extra early to watch the sunrise.
00:14:59.000,00:15:01.208,One morning I was making mental notes...
00:15:01.250,00:15:04.208,...of how the streaks of light were cutting through the clouds...
00:15:04.250,00:15:05.959,...so I could tell my dad...
00:15:06.000,00:15:08.667,...when I heard a noise below.
00:15:08.709,00:15:10.709,Excuse me.
00:15:10.750,00:15:13.166,"Excuse me. I'm sorry, but you can't park there. That's a bus stop."
00:15:13.208,00:15:15.000,"Hey, what are you doing up there?"
00:15:15.041,00:15:17.959,"You can't be up there, we're gonna take this thing down."
00:15:18.000,00:15:21.417,-The tree?
00:15:21.458,00:15:25.083,"-But who told you, you could cut it down?"
00:15:25.125,00:15:26.792,Why?
00:15:26.834,00:15:29.250,"He's gonna build a house, and this tree's in the way."
00:15:29.291,00:15:34.250,"-So come on, girl, we got work to do."
00:15:34.291,00:15:37.291,"Listen, girl. I'm this close to calling the police."
00:15:37.333,00:15:40.667,You are trespassing and obstructing progress on a contracted job.
00:15:40.709,00:15:43.917,"Now either you come down, or we're gonna cut you down."
00:15:43.959,00:15:46.250,Go ahead. Cut me down.
00:15:46.291,00:15:49.792,I'm not coming down.
00:15:49.834,00:15:51.834,"Bryce. You guys, come up here with me."
00:15:51.875,00:15:55.000,They won't cut it down if we're all up here.
00:15:55.041,00:15:57.542,"Bryce, please don't let them do this."
00:15:57.583,00:16:00.041,"Come on, you guys."
00:16:00.083,00:16:05.041,"Bryce, please. You don't have to come up this high. Just a little ways."
00:16:05.083,00:16:09.125,"Bryce, please. Please."
00:16:09.166,00:16:11.542,JULI: What happened after that was a blur.
00:16:14.667,00:16:17.125,It seemed like the whole town was there.
00:16:17.166,00:16:19.417,But still I wouldn't move.
00:16:19.458,00:16:21.667,Then my father showed up.
00:16:21.709,00:16:24.709,He talked a fireman into letting him come up to where I was.
00:16:27.625,00:16:30.208,"Sweetie, it's time to come down."
00:16:30.250,00:16:32.500,"Daddy, please don't let them do this."
00:16:32.542,00:16:34.500,-Sweetie....
00:16:34.542,00:16:38.333,You can see everything.
00:16:38.375,00:16:41.208,No view is worth my daughter's safety.
00:16:43.250,00:16:45.291,I can't.
00:16:45.333,00:16:49.291,"Julianna, it's time to come down now."
00:16:49.333,00:16:52.250,"Please, Daddy."
00:16:52.291,00:16:54.041,It's time.
00:17:00.500,00:17:01.917,JULI: And that was it.
00:17:03.583,00:17:06.208,I must've cried for two weeks straight.
00:17:07.917,00:17:10.792,"Oh, sure, I went to school and did the best I could..."
00:17:10.834,00:17:12.583,...but nothing seemed to matter.
00:17:12.625,00:17:14.750,TEACHER: Juli?
00:17:15.792,00:17:17.041,Do you know the answer?
00:17:18.417,00:17:21.250,"Uh, the Peloponnesian War?"
00:17:21.291,00:17:23.417,I'm sure that's the answer to something...
00:17:23.458,00:17:26.083,...but I was looking for the area of a rhomboid.
00:17:29.250,00:17:32.250,"JULI: Somehow, rhomboids and isosceles right triangles..."
00:17:32.291,00:17:35.125,...didn't seem so important.
00:17:35.166,00:17:37.959,I rode my bike so I wouldn't have to pass by the stump...
00:17:38.000,00:17:42.834,...that used to be the earth's most magnificent sycamore tree.
00:17:42.875,00:17:45.834,"But no matter what I did, I couldn't stop thinking about it."
00:17:50.166,00:17:52.542,Are you okay?
00:17:52.583,00:17:54.875,It was just a tree.
00:17:54.917,00:17:57.959,"No, it wasn't just a tree."
00:18:04.500,00:18:08.417,I never want you to forget how you felt when you were up there.
00:18:11.083,00:18:12.125,"Thanks, Dad."
00:18:16.917,00:18:19.417,JULI: It was the first thing I saw every morning...
00:18:19.458,00:18:22.333,...and the last thing I saw before I went to sleep.
00:18:22.375,00:18:24.959,And once I could look at it without crying...
00:18:25.000,00:18:29.917,...I saw more than the tree and what being up there meant to me.
00:18:29.959,00:18:33.583,I saw the day that my view of things around me started changing.
00:18:33.625,00:18:37.750,"And I wondered, did I still feel the same things about Bryce?"
00:18:43.500,00:18:46.000,BRYCE: I've never been a huge fan of eggs.
00:18:46.041,00:18:48.709,"I mean, I could always just take them or leave them."
00:18:48.750,00:18:51.875,"That is, until one day in Skyler Brown's garage..."
00:18:51.917,00:18:54.333,...when my feelings about eggs were solidified.
00:18:56.125,00:19:00.750,"Hey, hey, hey. Guys."
00:19:00.792,00:19:03.542,"BRYCE: I mean, if a slimy reptile found them appetizing..."
00:19:03.583,00:19:06.709,...there was certainly no place for them in my diet.
00:19:06.750,00:19:09.375,"MATT: Oh, man, that's so cool."
00:19:09.417,00:19:12.917,She doesn't even have to chew.
00:19:12.959,00:19:16.291,BRYCE: I could've gone my whole life not knowing that snakes eat eggs raw...
00:19:16.333,00:19:18.000,...if it hadn't been for Lynetta.
00:19:18.041,00:19:20.250,She had a major-league thing for Skyler Brown.
00:19:20.291,00:19:22.458,I think it's gross.
00:19:22.500,00:19:24.333,"BRYCE: He and Juli's brothers, Matt and Mark, had formed a band."
00:19:24.375,00:19:26.625,And Lynetta would watch them practice.
00:19:26.667,00:19:28.083,MATT: That is so neat.
00:19:28.125,00:19:29.917,"How about that, huh, Bryce?"
00:19:29.959,00:19:31.875,Yeah. Neat.
00:19:31.917,00:19:35.500,"So, Brycie, how do you think he's gonna digest that?"
00:19:35.542,00:19:38.208,-Stomach acid?
00:19:38.250,00:19:40.625,"Wait, everybody quiet. Here he goes."
00:19:44.291,00:19:46.208,Eggs over easy.
00:19:46.250,00:19:48.125,"Gross. Gross, gross, gross."
00:19:48.166,00:19:50.417,"Wait, wait."
00:19:51.583,00:19:53.375,LYNETTA: Ugh!
00:19:53.417,00:19:55.542,Gross.
00:19:55.583,00:19:58.500,"BRYCE: I tried to be casual about it, but it didn't take."
00:19:58.542,00:20:00.417,I started having bad dreams.
00:20:00.458,00:20:02.750,I'd be trapped inside a huge egg...
00:20:02.792,00:20:06.375,...and this monster would open his jaws and start to devour me.
00:20:06.417,00:20:08.458,I'd wake up just in time.
00:20:11.250,00:20:13.041,Then the real nightmare began.
00:20:13.083,00:20:16.041,"Hi, Bryce. I brought these over for you and your family."
00:20:16.083,00:20:18.417,-My chickens are laying eggs.
00:20:18.458,00:20:22.041,You remember Abby and Bonnie and Clyde and Dexter and Eunice and Florence?
00:20:22.083,00:20:25.000,-The ones I hatched for the science fair.
00:20:26.083,00:20:28.583,BRYCE: It was classic Juli Baker.
00:20:28.625,00:20:31.583,She totally dominated the fair.
00:20:31.625,00:20:36.333,"And get this, her project was all about watching boring eggs hatch."
00:20:36.375,00:20:39.750,"I mean, here I had a live-action erupting volcano..."
00:20:39.792,00:20:42.166,...and all anyone cared about was Juli's boring chicks...
00:20:42.208,00:20:44.083,...breaking out of their boring shells.
00:20:44.125,00:20:45.834,"JULI: Oh, I think the last one's hatching."
00:20:45.875,00:20:48.041,WOMAN 1: It's hatching.
00:20:48.083,00:20:49.709,"WOMAN 1: Kids, come over here."
00:20:49.750,00:20:52.709,"BRYCE: But hey, she won. I lost."
00:20:52.750,00:20:54.500,I've never been one to dwell.
00:20:54.542,00:20:56.375,WOMAN 2: Here it comes.
00:20:56.417,00:20:58.208,BRYCE: But that didn't mean I had to eat her lousy eggs.
00:20:58.250,00:21:00.875,I think it was very sweet of Juli to bring us those eggs.
00:21:00.917,00:21:03.458,I don't care.
00:21:03.500,00:21:06.583,"Yeah, how do we know there's no chicks in one of those eggs?"
00:21:06.625,00:21:10.125,I used to eat farm-fresh eggs when I was a kid. They were delicious.
00:21:10.166,00:21:12.125,"Yeah, well, that's all well and good..."
00:21:12.166,00:21:15.375,...but what if we crack one open and a dead chick falls out?
00:21:15.417,00:21:19.417,Do they have a rooster? If they don't have a rooster the eggs can't be fertile.
00:21:19.458,00:21:23.166,"And if they had a rooster, we'd know."
00:21:23.208,00:21:25.083,Maybe they got it de-yodeled.
00:21:25.125,00:21:26.417,De-yodeled?
00:21:26.458,00:21:28.500,You know.
00:21:28.542,00:21:30.500,What the hell are you talking about?
00:21:30.542,00:21:32.291,Like they de-bark dogs.
00:21:33.542,00:21:36.125,"Bryce, why don't you just ask Juli?"
00:21:36.166,00:21:37.917,-I don't think that-- LYNETTA: What?
00:21:37.959,00:21:40.458,-You afraid to talk to her?
00:21:42.542,00:21:44.125,"I know you are, but what am I?"
00:21:44.166,00:21:47.542,-Okay. Just talk to her and find out.
00:21:47.583,00:21:49.667,How do you tell if one's a rooster?
00:21:49.709,00:21:53.041,"-Well, a rooster's bigger."
00:21:53.083,00:21:55.625,They've got that red stuff growing out of their head.
00:21:55.667,00:21:59.792,-And around their neck too.
00:21:59.834,00:22:03.417,"Although, come to think of it, chickens have the rubbery red stuff too."
00:22:03.458,00:22:05.000,Just not as much.
00:22:05.041,00:22:07.458,BRYCE: Garrett's expertise in roosters...
00:22:07.500,00:22:10.375,...was the cornerstone of our plan to avoid contact with Juli Baker.
00:22:10.417,00:22:14.500,The balance of which involved spying over her back fence.
00:22:14.542,00:22:16.959,"-Come on, come on."
00:22:20.417,00:22:21.834,Over here.
00:22:28.458,00:22:30.375,BRYCE: I can't see the stupid chickens.
00:22:30.417,00:22:32.417,GARRETT: We gotta get them out of the coop.
00:22:38.834,00:22:40.208,BRYCE: Is that a rooster?
00:22:40.250,00:22:42.083,"GARRETT: No, it looks like a chicken."
00:22:42.125,00:22:44.041,How can you tell?
00:22:44.083,00:22:45.417,It just does.
00:22:45.458,00:22:47.542,BRYCE: See what I mean? Expertise.
00:22:49.583,00:22:50.792,"-Shh, shh!"
00:22:50.834,00:22:51.959,Juli.
00:22:52.000,00:22:54.417,"JULI: Here, guys."
00:22:54.458,00:22:56.709,"Go on, there you go."
00:22:56.750,00:22:59.458,"-Here, guys. Go on."
00:22:59.500,00:23:02.417,-There's no rooster?
00:23:02.458,00:23:04.208,How can you tell?
00:23:04.250,00:23:06.250,"-Well, none of them are strutting."
00:23:06.291,00:23:08.458,-Roosters strut?
00:23:08.500,00:23:11.125,-What did I just say?
00:23:11.166,00:23:14.375,"GARRETT: Plus, hardly any of them have any rubbery red stuff."
00:23:14.417,00:23:18.125,JULI: What are you doing?
00:23:18.166,00:23:19.959,They're all chickens.
00:23:20.000,00:23:21.291,"I'm proud of you, Bryce."
00:23:21.333,00:23:23.667,-You overcame your fear.
00:23:23.709,00:23:27.125,-You talked to her.
00:23:27.166,00:23:28.709,It's no big deal.
00:23:28.750,00:23:31.542,That's what she told you?
00:23:31.583,00:23:33.625,Yeah.
00:23:33.667,00:23:37.792,She's a genius. You're both genius-- Of course they're all chickens.
00:23:37.834,00:23:44.166,A rooster's a chicken. The question is: Is one of them a rooster or are they all hens?
00:23:44.208,00:23:47.875,BRYCE: Hens? Who said anything about hens?
00:23:47.917,00:23:49.500,Then it hit me.
00:23:49.542,00:23:52.750,Garrett didn't know jack shit about chickens.
00:23:52.792,00:23:55.667,-Do roosters strut?
00:23:55.709,00:23:58.000,What does that have to do with anything?
00:23:58.041,00:23:59.667,They're all hens.
00:24:01.709,00:24:04.834,"Well, the main thing is the eggs are okay."
00:24:04.875,00:24:06.375,It's all settled.
00:24:06.417,00:24:08.375,BRYCE: Not for me.
00:24:08.417,00:24:10.291,There was no way I was ever gonna eat anything...
00:24:10.333,00:24:12.709,...that had anything to do with Juli Baker.
00:24:12.750,00:24:14.625,I'm not eating them.
00:24:14.667,00:24:16.166,"Well, why not?"
00:24:16.208,00:24:22.959,Have you seen their yard? It's-- There's not even any grass.
00:24:23.000,00:24:26.417,Ew. Gross. Salmonella.
00:24:27.625,00:24:29.667,Do you suppose they could have salmonella?
00:24:29.709,00:24:32.667,-It's not very likely.
00:24:32.709,00:24:34.500,What do we do with the eggs?
00:24:34.542,00:24:36.375,Give them back.
00:24:36.417,00:24:39.166,-Give them back? To Juli?
00:24:39.208,00:24:42.583,"You talked to her before, right?"
00:24:42.625,00:24:44.875,"Well, what do I say?"
00:24:44.917,00:24:46.417,Tell her we don't eat eggs.
00:24:47.875,00:24:51.166,"Uh, we're allergic to them or something."
00:24:51.208,00:24:52.583,"Come on, use your brains."
00:24:54.291,00:24:57.208,BRYCE: It didn't feel right to lie.
00:24:57.250,00:25:00.959,"Besides, even a seventh grader would know that entire families aren't allergic to eggs."
00:25:01.000,00:25:03.542,But I didn't wanna hurt her feelings either.
00:25:03.583,00:25:05.959,So that left me with only one option.
00:25:06.000,00:25:08.125,And thus another near-death experience...
00:25:08.166,00:25:11.875,...in my ongoing saga with Juli Baker had been successfully avoided.
00:25:11.917,00:25:13.208,Until one week later.
00:25:13.250,00:25:15.542,"Hi, Bryce. Brought you some more eggs."
00:25:15.583,00:25:17.125,Wow.
00:25:17.166,00:25:20.750,-Thanks.
00:25:20.792,00:25:22.792,Do you even have to ask?
00:25:22.834,00:25:26.041,Great. See you at school.
00:25:26.083,00:25:28.750,BRYCE: What I hoped would be a one-time event...
00:25:28.792,00:25:33.125,"...was just the beginning of a life consumed with lies, intrigue and deception."
00:25:33.166,00:25:35.834,Every morning I'd be on the lookout for Juli...
00:25:35.875,00:25:39.542,"...so if she happened to come, I could whip the door open before she knocked."
00:25:39.583,00:25:40.959,Thanks.
00:25:42.917,00:25:45.250,BRYCE: Then I'd dump the eggs before anyone noticed.
00:25:45.291,00:25:48.792,And why? Why couldn't I just face her?
00:25:48.834,00:25:54.291,"Why couldn't I just say: No, thanks. Don't want them."
00:25:54.333,00:25:57.792,Was I really afraid of hurting her feelings...
00:25:57.834,00:25:59.959,...or was I just afraid of her?
00:26:03.625,00:26:06.458,"Now, you wanna make sure you get it...."
00:26:06.500,00:26:09.166,JULI: When Mrs. Brubeck first suggested hatching eggs as my science project...
00:26:09.208,00:26:11.792,...I was less than excited.
00:26:11.834,00:26:14.542,"That is, until I saw my first sign of life."
00:26:15.542,00:26:17.250,Is that it?
00:26:17.291,00:26:20.959,-That's the embryo. Heh.
00:26:21.000,00:26:24.000,-It looks like a bean.
00:26:24.041,00:26:25.625,Let's try the other ones.
00:26:25.667,00:26:27.375,JULI: Suddenly it felt real.
00:26:27.417,00:26:29.333,All the eggs were alive.
00:26:29.375,00:26:32.959,"There were, like, little bean babies inside every one."
00:26:33.000,00:26:35.709,"On the day of the fair, all six chicks hatched."
00:26:35.750,00:26:37.750,What are the odds?
00:26:37.792,00:26:40.625,This year's top prize goes to Juli Baker...
00:26:40.667,00:26:45.333,...for her wonderful project: A Chicken is Born.
00:26:47.041,00:26:49.291,JULI: I won first place.
00:26:49.333,00:26:53.667,"And that was cool, but all I really cared about were my chicks."
00:26:53.709,00:26:55.583,"There you go. There you go, guys."
00:26:55.625,00:26:58.208,JULI: My mom wasn't crazy about us raising chickens.
00:26:58.250,00:27:00.250,But I begged and pleaded.
00:27:00.291,00:27:03.291,I told her I would take care of everything.
00:27:03.333,00:27:04.959,Where's Clyde?
00:27:07.083,00:27:08.667,Clyde?
00:27:10.375,00:27:12.583,"Hey, Clyde. What's the matter?"
00:27:12.625,00:27:14.875,Are you okay? Aren't you hungry?
00:27:14.917,00:27:18.000,Come on. Come here.
00:27:18.041,00:27:19.208,Come here.
00:27:21.250,00:27:25.667,"Hey, you're not Clyde. You're Clydette."
00:27:25.709,00:27:28.208,Mom!
00:27:28.250,00:27:32.709,"JULI: As it turned out, my hens laid more eggs than we could eat."
00:27:32.750,00:27:34.959,At first we tried to keep up...
00:27:35.000,00:27:37.709,"...but after a month of boiling, frying and deviling..."
00:27:37.750,00:27:41.834,"...like that movie The Blob, we were being overtaken by eggs."
00:27:41.875,00:27:45.625,"Then opportunity in the form of our neighbor, Mrs. Steuby, knocked."
00:27:45.667,00:27:47.583,"STEUBY: Hello, dear."
00:27:49.417,00:27:54.000,"If you ever have any extra, I'd be happy to buy them from you."
00:27:54.041,00:27:56.333,-Really?
00:27:56.375,00:27:59.750,And I happen to know that Mrs.
00:28:00.792,00:28:03.917,-Great.
00:28:03.959,00:28:07.667,"-Thanks, Mrs. Steuby."
00:28:07.709,00:28:12.375,"JULI: Between Mrs. Steuby and Mrs. Helms, my egg overflow problem was solved."
00:28:12.417,00:28:15.250,Then I realized that Mrs. Loski deserved eggs too.
00:28:15.291,00:28:17.875,But I didn't think it would be right to charge her.
00:28:17.917,00:28:21.333,"She had been such a good neighbor, lending us supplies when we ran out..."
00:28:21.375,00:28:24.125,...giving my mother a ride when our car wouldn't start...
00:28:24.166,00:28:26.792,...it was the least I could do.
00:28:26.834,00:28:30.750,"Besides, if I happened to run into Bryce, that wouldn't be the end of the world."
00:28:30.792,00:28:33.000,"Hi, Bryce."
00:28:33.041,00:28:34.625,JULI: By the third time I brought eggs over to the Loskis...
00:28:34.667,00:28:37.291,...I realized Bryce was waiting for me.
00:28:37.333,00:28:40.542,"Waiting to pull open the door and say, Thanks, Juli. See you at school."
00:28:40.583,00:28:42.917,"And in return, I got a few moments alone..."
00:28:42.959,00:28:44.917,...with the world's most dazzling eyes.
00:28:44.959,00:28:48.166,"Thanks, Juli. See you at school."
00:28:48.208,00:28:50.250,JULI: It was a bargain.
00:28:50.291,00:28:52.333,Until the day it wasn't.
00:28:52.375,00:28:55.083,It was two weeks after the sycamore tree was cut down...
00:28:55.125,00:28:57.667,...and I was just starting to feel normal again.
00:29:01.417,00:29:03.917,"Hey, Juli. Right on schedule."
00:29:03.959,00:29:06.208,"Yeah, well, neither rain nor sleet."
00:29:06.250,00:29:09.291,-Huh?
00:29:09.333,00:29:11.625,Oh. Right.
00:29:15.500,00:29:19.291,"So, um, will you start riding the bus again?"
00:29:19.333,00:29:22.125,I don't know.
00:29:22.166,00:29:25.166,It doesn't look so bad anymore.
00:29:30.542,00:29:33.625,"Well, um, I better get ready for school."
00:29:33.667,00:29:35.625,Guess I'll see you there.
00:29:35.667,00:29:37.917,See you.
00:29:37.959,00:29:39.667,JULI: Maybe Bryce was right.
00:29:39.709,00:29:42.542,Maybe it was time I started riding the bus again.
00:29:42.583,00:29:46.083,"After all, didn't he just tell me he wanted me to?"
00:29:46.125,00:29:49.792,Could it be that Bryce Loski actually misses me?
00:29:55.291,00:29:57.959,Juli? What are you still doing here?
00:29:58.000,00:29:59.458,I was just thinking.
00:30:00.750,00:30:03.291,It's pickup day. The cans are in front.
00:30:03.333,00:30:04.875,I know. You need some help?
00:30:06.291,00:30:08.625,No. Maybe I'll do it later.
00:30:08.667,00:30:10.000,Are those my eggs?
00:30:11.750,00:30:14.917,"Yeah. Yeah, I dropped them."
00:30:14.959,00:30:16.667,They're not broken.
00:30:16.709,00:30:18.542,Why are you throwing them away?
00:30:22.542,00:30:24.709,Don't you want them?
00:30:24.750,00:30:27.875,It wasn't me.
00:30:27.917,00:30:29.875,Risk? What risk?
00:30:29.917,00:30:31.542,Salmonella.
00:30:31.583,00:30:34.125,What? He's afraid of being poisoned?
00:30:34.166,00:30:37.875,"Well, Juli, I mean, look at your back yard."
00:30:37.917,00:30:39.709,"It's, like, covered in turds."
00:30:39.750,00:30:42.375,That's not true.
00:30:45.125,00:30:47.125,We just didn't wanna hurt your feelings.
00:30:50.208,00:30:52.083,Have you always thrown them away?
00:30:56.625,00:30:59.709,"You know, Mrs. Steuby and Mrs."
00:30:59.750,00:31:02.792,-They do?
00:31:02.834,00:31:03.917,I didn't know.
00:31:05.500,00:31:06.917,How could you?
00:31:08.291,00:31:09.750,I'm sorry.
00:31:11.583,00:31:13.291,"No, you're not."
00:31:28.959,00:31:31.041,BRYCE: It didn't take me long to realize...
00:31:31.083,00:31:33.125,...that I'd traded in my old problems with Juli Baker...
00:31:33.166,00:31:36.125,...for a whole set of new ones.
00:31:36.166,00:31:40.875,It was actually worse having her mad at me than having her annoy me.
00:31:40.917,00:31:43.291,The way she ignored me was a constant reminder...
00:31:43.333,00:31:44.959,...that I'd been a jerk.
00:31:48.875,00:31:52.542,Then one day I was coming home from playing basketball with Garrett...
00:31:52.583,00:31:54.250,...and things got weird.
00:31:54.291,00:31:56.667,CHET: Don't be so timid.
00:31:56.709,00:31:59.375,JULI: Like this?
00:31:59.417,00:32:02.208,BRYCE: My grandfather.
00:32:02.250,00:32:06.917,All I ever saw him wear was slippers.
00:32:06.959,00:32:09.041,I couldn't stop looking over there.
00:32:09.083,00:32:12.750,"And the more I looked, the madder I got."
00:32:12.792,00:32:15.667,My grandfather had already said more to Juli in one hour...
00:32:15.709,00:32:18.875,...than he'd said to me in the whole time he'd been living with us.
00:32:18.917,00:32:21.250,I was pretty sure I'd never seen him laugh.
00:32:22.709,00:32:25.125,And what was his deal with Juli Baker?
00:32:30.709,00:32:32.375,"Hi, Grandpa."
00:32:34.792,00:32:36.500,Juli told me about the eggs.
00:32:38.750,00:32:40.083,"You know, Bryce..."
00:32:40.125,00:32:44.041,...one's character is set at an early age.
00:32:44.083,00:32:47.208,I'd hate to see you swim out so far you can't swim back.
00:32:47.250,00:32:49.208,Sir?
00:32:49.250,00:32:51.875,"It's about honesty, son."
00:32:51.917,00:32:54.667,Sometimes a little discomfort in the beginning...
00:32:54.709,00:32:57.500,...can save a whole lot of pain down the road.
00:33:11.083,00:33:17.125,"BRYCE: When it came to holding a grudge, Juli Baker was truly impressive."
00:33:17.166,00:33:19.500,All week I tried to approach her at school.
00:33:19.542,00:33:22.375,She'd always find some way to duck me.
00:33:22.417,00:33:27.000,"And whenever she was in her yard, Grandpa was always there with her."
00:33:28.667,00:33:32.750,"Finally, one Saturday I saw my opening."
00:33:32.792,00:33:36.291,My grandfather had gone into town to buy some Bengay.
00:33:36.333,00:33:39.208,I guess the yard work was starting to get to him.
00:33:40.959,00:33:42.875,BRYCE: It's looking real good.
00:33:45.542,00:33:48.709,Thanks. Chet did most of it.
00:33:50.959,00:33:53.125,I'm sorry for what I did.
00:33:56.500,00:33:59.750,"I just don't get it, Bryce."
00:34:00.959,00:34:02.875,I don't know. It was dumb.
00:34:02.917,00:34:05.583,"And I shouldn't have said anything about your yard, either."
00:34:05.625,00:34:07.291,It wasn't right.
00:34:08.750,00:34:11.750,Maybe it's all for the best.
00:34:11.792,00:34:15.667,"I mean, look, I learned so much from Chet, it's amazing."
00:34:16.792,00:34:18.917,You're lucky.
00:34:18.959,00:34:21.083,I don't even have grandparents anymore.
00:34:22.792,00:34:24.208,Oh.
00:34:26.333,00:34:28.709,I feel sorry for him.
00:34:28.750,00:34:30.208,He misses your grandma.
00:34:32.333,00:34:35.458,Can you believe it?
00:34:35.500,00:34:37.917,-What?
00:34:37.959,00:34:42.834,But he meant it in a nice way.
00:34:42.875,00:34:44.917,Yeah.
00:34:44.959,00:34:46.667,Well....
00:34:46.709,00:34:49.709,Good luck with the grass.
00:34:51.667,00:34:53.083,Thanks.
00:34:56.083,00:34:57.834,I guess I'll see you around.
00:34:57.875,00:34:59.542,I guess so.
00:35:14.834,00:35:18.333,BRYCE: While Juli's acceptance of my apology was not all that I'd hoped for...
00:35:18.375,00:35:21.291,...at least the eggs thing was finally behind me.
00:35:21.333,00:35:24.792,The first time in months I could truly enjoy Bonanza.
00:35:27.750,00:35:29.834,Where you going and why you dressed like that?
00:35:30.917,00:35:33.250,Skyler's.
00:35:33.291,00:35:35.875,Matt and Mark are bringing over recording stuff and they're gonna make a demo.
00:35:35.917,00:35:39.333,Demo? Like they know how to make a demo.
00:35:39.375,00:35:43.625,-You don't even know them.
00:35:43.667,00:35:46.250,-You don't know anything.
00:35:46.291,00:35:48.667,-I'm late.
00:35:48.709,00:35:51.709,BRYCE: Yep. Everything was back to normal.
00:35:58.959,00:36:00.709,Is that girl working you too hard?
00:36:03.166,00:36:07.709,That girl's name is Juli.
00:36:07.750,00:36:10.166,"You've developed quite a soft spot for her, huh?"
00:36:10.208,00:36:12.083,Steven.
00:36:12.125,00:36:16.000,"No, Patsy. Just wanna find out why your father has the energy..."
00:36:16.041,00:36:18.208,...to befriend a complete stranger...
00:36:18.250,00:36:21.333,...when he won't throw a baseball around with his own grandson.
00:36:21.375,00:36:24.834,"-It's okay, Dad."
00:36:24.875,00:36:26.542,Juli reminds him of Grandma.
00:36:26.583,00:36:28.875,Of Renee? Heh.
00:36:28.917,00:36:30.125,That's ridiculous.
00:36:31.667,00:36:34.125,You know why the Bakers haven't fixed their yard?
00:36:34.166,00:36:38.959,"Yeah, because he's too busy with his paint-by-numbers kit."
00:36:39.000,00:36:42.542,"If you had a brother with a severe handicap, what would you do?"
00:36:42.583,00:36:45.166,What the hell does that have to do with anything?
00:36:45.208,00:36:47.959,Juli's father has a retarded brother.
00:36:48.000,00:36:50.792,"So what? He's not the gardener, is he? Heh."
00:36:50.834,00:36:52.667,-Steven.
00:36:52.709,00:36:55.625,It was a joke.
00:36:55.667,00:36:58.000,"You know, other people have family troubles..."
00:36:58.041,00:37:01.625,...and they manage to mow their own lawns.
00:37:01.667,00:37:03.917,I don't know where their pride in ownership is.
00:37:03.959,00:37:06.166,They don't own that house.
00:37:06.208,00:37:08.500,The landlord's supposed to maintain it.
00:37:08.542,00:37:12.834,Mr. Baker puts every extra penny he has into caring for his brother.
00:37:12.875,00:37:16.709,Don't they have government facilities for that sort of thing?
00:37:16.750,00:37:19.583,Maybe they thought that a private facility would be better for him.
00:37:19.625,00:37:24.000,"Either way, it's not our fault that their family has some chromosomal abnormality."
00:37:24.041,00:37:27.125,It has nothing to do with chromosomes.
00:37:27.166,00:37:30.875,"When Juli's uncle was born, he had the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck."
00:37:30.917,00:37:35.750,"If he'd had enough oxygen, he would've been a perfect little baby, just like your son."
00:37:38.709,00:37:41.750,"Goddamn it, Chet."
00:37:41.792,00:37:44.667,-Patsy? Patsy?
00:37:46.625,00:37:48.834,Sorry about that.
00:37:48.875,00:37:50.875,Why is Mom so upset?
00:37:54.291,00:37:56.625,Because...
00:37:56.667,00:37:59.333,...but for the grace of God...
00:37:59.375,00:38:02.166,...your mother could be standing in Mr. Baker's shoes.
00:38:02.208,00:38:05.125,Did her brother have the cord wrapped around his neck too?
00:38:07.417,00:38:08.458,You did.
00:38:10.583,00:38:14.333,"Luckily, the doctor who delivered you was on the ball and got it untangled..."
00:38:14.375,00:38:18.583,...but it easily could've gone the other way.
00:38:25.917,00:38:27.375,-Wanna go for a walk?
00:38:28.375,00:38:30.750,I find it helps clear the mind.
00:38:33.959,00:38:36.583,What would they have done with me?
00:38:36.625,00:38:40.792,"You can't dwell on something that might've been, Bryce."
00:38:40.834,00:38:44.625,"The way my dad was talking, sounds like he would've thrown me in a nuthouse."
00:38:44.667,00:38:46.792,"No, no. Now, that's not fair."
00:38:46.834,00:38:50.041,You can't condemn him for something he hasn't done.
00:38:54.792,00:38:56.792,"This is where that tree was, wasn't it?"
00:38:56.834,00:38:58.291,Yeah.
00:39:00.709,00:39:03.458,Must've been a spectacular view.
00:39:09.834,00:39:11.291,She's quite a girl.
00:39:14.792,00:39:17.500,Some of us get dipped in flat...
00:39:17.542,00:39:19.125,...some in satin...
00:39:19.166,00:39:21.125,...some in gloss.
00:39:21.166,00:39:23.208,But every once in a while...
00:39:23.250,00:39:26.417,...you find someone who's iridescent.
00:39:28.166,00:39:30.625,And when you do...
00:39:30.667,00:39:32.709,...nothing will ever compare.
00:39:40.542,00:39:43.208,"BRYCE: Flat, glossy, iridescent?"
00:39:43.250,00:39:45.000,What the hell did that mean?
00:39:45.041,00:39:48.291,Juli Baker had always just seemed plain to me.
00:39:50.542,00:39:52.250,Until now.
00:40:01.041,00:40:04.458,And the way she talked about what it felt like to be up in that tree...
00:40:04.500,00:40:07.667,"...to be held above the earth, brushed by the wind."
00:40:07.709,00:40:10.375,Who in junior high talks like that?
00:40:10.417,00:40:13.875,This weird feeling started taking over in the pit of my stomach...
00:40:13.917,00:40:16.250,...and I didn't like it.
00:40:16.291,00:40:18.208,"I was slipping, man."
00:40:18.250,00:40:21.458,And it was time to get a grip.
00:40:21.500,00:40:24.208,JULI: I'd never been embarrassed by where we lived before.
00:40:24.250,00:40:26.625,I also never really thought about money.
00:40:26.667,00:40:30.500,"I knew we weren't rich, but I didn't feel like we were missing anything."
00:40:30.542,00:40:33.417,"That is, until Bryce Loski called our home a complete mess."
00:40:33.458,00:40:36.625,name?
00:40:36.667,00:40:39.709,Is it Mary or Sue?
00:40:39.750,00:40:42.166,What's your name?
00:40:42.208,00:40:45.166,Do I stand a chance with you?
00:40:45.208,00:40:59.667,"It's so hard to find a personality With charms like yours for me Ooh-ee, ooh-ee, ooh-ee JULI: I had to do something and I knew what it was."
00:40:59.709,00:41:02.792,What's your name?
00:41:09.083,00:41:11.834,"-Oh, you're sounding really good."
00:41:11.875,00:41:14.041,We'll record it in Skyler's garage.
00:41:14.083,00:41:16.375,That's a wonderful project.
00:41:16.417,00:41:19.709,"Speaking of projects, I was thinking it might be cool to fix up the yard."
00:41:19.750,00:41:22.125,-What?
00:41:22.166,00:41:25.291,"I could plant a lawn, maybe some flowers."
00:41:25.333,00:41:27.250,I could even put up a fence.
00:41:27.291,00:41:31.875,"Honey, that's a major undertaking."
00:41:31.917,00:41:35.834,-I could pay for it with my egg money.
00:41:35.875,00:41:39.458,The landlord should be the one taking care of all this.
00:41:39.500,00:41:42.625,But he doesn't. And we live here.
00:41:43.834,00:41:45.625,And it looks so bad.
00:41:47.166,00:41:49.417,Jules.
00:41:49.458,00:41:51.583,What's going on?
00:41:51.625,00:41:53.208,"Nothing, Dad."
00:41:55.208,00:41:57.625,"It's okay, sweetheart."
00:41:57.667,00:41:59.333,You can tell us.
00:42:02.250,00:42:06.417,The Loskis have been throwing away my eggs because they're afraid of salmonella.
00:42:06.458,00:42:08.625,Because our yard is such a mess.
00:42:10.000,00:42:11.917,Did Patsy say that?
00:42:11.959,00:42:14.792,No. Bryce did.
00:42:17.417,00:42:20.458,But it must have been a family discussion.
00:42:20.500,00:42:23.250,A boy doesn't come up with that on his own.
00:42:23.291,00:42:25.583,-Who cares what they think?
00:42:25.625,00:42:28.333,-I care.
00:42:28.375,00:42:29.709,Let's not get into this.
00:42:29.750,00:42:32.875,"No, I'm tired of living like this, Richard."
00:42:32.917,00:42:36.208,I'm tired of having to take temp jobs just to make ends meet.
00:42:36.250,00:42:39.625,I'm tired of having to push a chair up against the washing machine...
00:42:39.667,00:42:41.667,...just to keep the door shut.
00:42:41.709,00:42:44.625,I'm tired of having to borrow Mrs. Steuby's vacuum cleaner...
00:42:44.667,00:42:46.667,...every time ours breaks down.
00:42:46.709,00:42:50.333,Do you think this is the life I pictured for us?
00:42:50.375,00:42:53.291,Sometimes you have to sacrifice to do the right thing.
00:42:53.333,00:42:58.208,We always end up agreeing that Devonhurst is the right thing for Daniel.
00:42:58.250,00:43:02.083,"Well, maybe we should start thinking about what's right for us."
00:43:02.125,00:43:05.792,Our daughter is suffering because we won't fix up our own yard.
00:43:05.834,00:43:08.250,It's not our yard.
00:43:08.291,00:43:12.375,"How can you say that, Richard?"
00:43:12.417,00:43:14.333,We've lived here for 12 years...
00:43:14.375,00:43:18.375,"...and for 12 years we've been saying it's temporary, but it's not."
00:43:18.417,00:43:20.375,This is our home.
00:43:20.417,00:43:23.792,Is it wrong to wanna live somewhere you can be proud of?
00:43:23.834,00:43:27.417,To have enough to send your kids to college?
00:43:27.458,00:43:29.709,Maybe it's time we considered government care.
00:43:29.750,00:43:33.417,We are not moving my brother.
00:43:33.458,00:43:35.875,He's more important than your own children?
00:43:35.917,00:43:37.250,-Dad!
00:43:37.291,00:43:40.917,"Stop it, Dad! Please, just stop."
00:43:43.125,00:43:47.542,"I'm sorry. Julianna, this is not your fault."
00:43:47.583,00:43:51.917,"We'll work this out, I promise."
00:43:51.959,00:43:55.792,JULI: That was the first time I ever heard my parents really yell at each other.
00:43:57.000,00:43:58.709,I'm sorry about tonight.
00:43:58.750,00:44:01.000,JULI: That night they each came into my room.
00:44:01.041,00:44:03.834,My father talked about his brother and how much he loved him...
00:44:03.875,00:44:07.875,...and how he promised his parents he'd always take care of him.
00:44:07.917,00:44:10.500,My mother talked about how much she loved my father...
00:44:10.542,00:44:12.792,...for his strength and kind heart.
00:44:12.834,00:44:15.041,When she kissed me good night...
00:44:15.083,00:44:18.333,"...she whispered that of all her many blessings, I was her best."
00:44:21.000,00:44:22.917,I felt sorry for my father.
00:44:22.959,00:44:25.000,I felt sorry for my mother.
00:44:25.041,00:44:28.959,"But most of all, I felt lucky for me that they were mine."
00:44:30.667,00:44:33.542,I wanted to think the reason I started working on my yard...
00:44:33.583,00:44:36.959,...had nothing to do with Bryce.
00:44:37.000,00:44:41.083,"After what he did with the eggs, why should I care what he thought?"
00:44:41.125,00:44:42.625,But I did.
00:44:42.667,00:44:44.875,Are you pruning that or trying to hack it to death?
00:44:47.583,00:44:50.834,"Hi. I'm Chet Duncan, Bryce's grandfather."
00:44:50.875,00:44:53.875,Sorry it's taken me so long to come over and introduce myself.
00:44:53.917,00:44:55.959,Nice to meet you.
00:44:56.000,00:44:58.917,So are you trimming all these to the same height?
00:44:58.959,00:45:01.709,"Well, yeah, that's what I was thinking, but I don't know."
00:45:01.750,00:45:03.875,Do you think it would look better to take them out?
00:45:03.917,00:45:08.417,"Oh, these are Hicksii shrubs."
00:45:11.792,00:45:13.125,"Listen, Mr. Duncan."
00:45:13.166,00:45:15.250,Call me Chet.
00:45:15.291,00:45:16.959,Chet.
00:45:17.000,00:45:19.834,If you're here because of what Bryce said...
00:45:19.875,00:45:21.166,...I don't need your help.
00:45:23.250,00:45:26.458,Read about you in the paper.
00:45:26.500,00:45:29.500,Renee would've sat up in that tree with you.
00:45:29.542,00:45:33.250,She would've sat up there all night.
00:45:33.291,00:45:34.959,Renee?
00:45:35.000,00:45:37.375,My wife.
00:45:37.417,00:45:38.959,You remind me a lot of her.
00:45:44.417,00:45:46.208,JULI: We worked on the yard for weeks.
00:45:46.250,00:45:49.875,"And the whole time we worked, we talked."
00:45:49.917,00:45:51.709,-Right there?
00:45:51.750,00:45:54.500,JULI: He wanted to know more about the sycamore tree.
00:45:54.542,00:45:56.709,He knew exactly what it meant...
00:45:56.750,00:45:59.166,...about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.
00:45:59.208,00:46:01.166,He said it was the same with people...
00:46:01.208,00:46:04.542,"...but sometimes with people, the whole could be less."
00:46:04.583,00:46:06.875,I thought that was pretty interesting.
00:46:06.917,00:46:09.875,I started looking at people I'd known since elementary school...
00:46:09.917,00:46:13.458,...trying to figure out if they were more or less than the sum of their parts.
00:46:16.375,00:46:19.667,Chet was right. A lot of them were less.
00:46:22.375,00:46:26.291,"Of all my classmates, the one person I couldn't seem to place was Bryce."
00:46:31.208,00:46:34.000,"Until recently, I would've said with absolute certainty..."
00:46:34.041,00:46:38.000,"...that he was greater, far greater, than the sum of his parts."
00:46:38.041,00:46:39.709,But now I wasn't so sure.
00:46:39.750,00:46:43.291,"It's looking good, Juli. Nice job."
00:46:43.333,00:46:46.375,Thanks. Chet did most of it.
00:46:49.208,00:46:51.417,I'm sorry for what I did.
00:46:54.792,00:46:56.792,"I just don't get it, Bryce."
00:46:56.834,00:46:58.917,Why didn't you just tell me?
00:46:58.959,00:47:01.125,JULI: Was he really sorry?
00:47:01.166,00:47:03.875,Or was he just saying these things to make himself feel better?
00:47:03.917,00:47:08.250,Then I thought maybe I just wanted him to be more than the sum of his parts.
00:47:08.291,00:47:10.625,But as I looked into his eyes...
00:47:10.667,00:47:13.583,...those dazzling eyes...
00:47:13.625,00:47:15.375,...for the first time...
00:47:15.417,00:47:18.375,...I was pretty sure that Bryce Loski was less.
00:47:28.000,00:47:31.208,We're going to invite the Bakers over for dinner.
00:47:31.250,00:47:33.542,-What?
00:47:33.583,00:47:35.458,I think that's a marvelous idea.
00:47:35.500,00:47:37.750,"Patsy, what purpose does this serve?"
00:47:37.792,00:47:40.291,Trina Baker is a very nice person.
00:47:40.333,00:47:43.792,-And Matt and Mark are really cool.
00:47:43.834,00:47:46.000,Something we should've done years ago.
00:47:46.041,00:47:48.667,"Yeah, but we didn't. And now we can't."
00:47:48.709,00:47:51.709,The statute of limitations has run out.
00:47:51.750,00:47:53.959,We're having the Bakers over for dinner.
00:47:56.333,00:48:01.125,"If this is about what I said last night, I'm sorry, okay?"
00:48:01.166,00:48:04.959,"But, you know, having them over for dinner is not gonna fix his brother."
00:48:05.000,00:48:06.959,It's going to be a sit-down dinner.
00:48:07.000,00:48:09.875,And I expect everyone to dress accordingly.
00:48:09.917,00:48:12.083,"Oh, God. Can't we just have a barbecue?"
00:48:12.125,00:48:15.166,It's going to be a sit-down dinner.
00:48:16.792,00:48:18.792,Just shoot me now.
00:48:18.834,00:48:21.458,Careful what you wish for.
00:48:21.500,00:48:23.750,BRYCE: So that was it.
00:48:23.792,00:48:26.417,"A dress-up, sit-down dinner with Juli Baker was in my immediate future."
00:48:29.375,00:48:32.583,And that made seeing Juli at school more uncomfortable.
00:48:32.625,00:48:34.875,I found myself staring at her in class.
00:48:34.917,00:48:37.542,And the way her hair fell back over her shoulders...
00:48:37.583,00:48:40.041,...she looked just like the picture in the newspaper.
00:48:41.709,00:48:43.834,Dana Tressler caught me watching.
00:48:43.875,00:48:46.917,"If I didn't do something fast, this could spread like wildfire."
00:48:46.959,00:48:48.667,There was a bee in her hair.
00:48:49.709,00:48:50.834,"See, there it goes."
00:48:53.709,00:48:55.709,There's no bee.
00:48:55.750,00:48:58.333,It flew out the window.
00:48:58.375,00:49:02.000,BRYCE: I convinced myself I'd dodged a bullet.
00:49:02.041,00:49:04.458,I had to put Juli out of my mind.
00:49:04.500,00:49:07.917,Keep the focus on the important stuff like schoolwork.
00:49:10.959,00:49:12.792,My weakness was unnerving.
00:49:14.291,00:49:16.166,I need your sharpener.
00:49:16.208,00:49:18.667,-You ever heard of knocking?
00:49:18.709,00:49:20.166,None of your business.
00:49:20.208,00:49:23.250,-Give my best to Miss October.
00:49:23.291,00:49:25.583,"-Or should I say your best? Ha, ha."
00:49:27.291,00:49:29.625,BRYCE: Another disaster avoided.
00:49:29.667,00:49:32.500,My life had become a minefield.
00:49:32.542,00:49:34.667,"GARRETT: Hey, man."
00:49:36.667,00:49:38.333,What's this?
00:49:38.375,00:49:40.250,Whoa.
00:49:40.291,00:49:42.166,It's not what you think.
00:49:43.458,00:49:47.041,"Okay, it is what you think, but I can explain."
00:49:47.083,00:49:50.000,"Okay, I can't explain."
00:49:50.041,00:49:51.792,Whatever you say.
00:49:51.834,00:49:53.917,BRYCE: I had to talk to someone.
00:49:53.959,00:49:56.792,Why not Garrett?
00:49:56.834,00:49:59.667,Garrett was surprisingly sensitive in matters of the heart.
00:49:59.709,00:50:02.083,Are you freaking mental? Juli Baker.
00:50:02.125,00:50:05.417,That's what's weird. I don't think I do.
00:50:05.458,00:50:08.333,"-You got it bad, man."
00:50:08.375,00:50:11.542,"Well, you gotta nip this in the bud."
00:50:11.583,00:50:14.333,-They're not?
00:50:14.375,00:50:15.959,"Yeah, and I insulted her yard."
00:50:16.000,00:50:18.375,"Exactly. Of course, the place is a dump anyways."
00:50:18.417,00:50:22.083,Her dad's got a retarded brother and all their money goes to helping him.
00:50:22.125,00:50:25.083,"A retard? Well, shoot, that ought to tell you something."
00:50:25.125,00:50:28.375,-About what?
00:50:28.417,00:50:30.041,What are you saying?
00:50:30.083,00:50:32.125,The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
00:50:32.166,00:50:35.000,BRYCE: I couldn't believe it.
00:50:35.041,00:50:38.208,Tell him that he didn't know Juli like I did.
00:50:38.250,00:50:42.667,"But all that came out was: Heh, oh."
00:50:42.709,00:50:45.291,-Right.
00:50:45.333,00:50:48.583,"Right. Um, I'll talk to you later."
00:50:51.208,00:50:53.750,BRYCE: I was supposed to go to Garrett's after school...
00:50:53.792,00:50:55.500,...but I couldn't be around him.
00:50:55.542,00:50:57.375,He'd crossed the line.
00:50:57.417,00:51:01.500,And standing right next to him across that line was my father.
00:51:01.542,00:51:03.625,I didn't care what they thought.
00:51:03.667,00:51:05.959,I liked Juli Baker.
00:51:09.125,00:51:11.417,JULI: Sunday mornings are peaceful in our house.
00:51:11.458,00:51:13.417,My dad lets himself sleep in.
00:51:13.458,00:51:15.709,My mother lets herself not fix breakfast.
00:51:15.750,00:51:18.667,If my brothers have been out late playing with their band...
00:51:18.709,00:51:21.166,...you won't even know they're around till noon.
00:51:21.208,00:51:24.250,"But this Sunday, I woke up feeling weird."
00:51:24.291,00:51:27.709,I had to do something to shake off the confused feelings about Bryce...
00:51:27.750,00:51:29.792,...that were starting to creep back in.
00:51:37.542,00:51:41.000,"You really did it, didn't you?"
00:51:42.083,00:51:45.375,-Proud of you.
00:51:45.417,00:51:49.250,-Where you going?
00:51:51.083,00:51:52.917,I wanna come with you.
00:51:52.959,00:51:56.166,"Oh, honey, just enjoy the morning, stay with your mom."
00:51:57.709,00:52:00.208,"No, Dad. I wanna come."
00:52:01.250,00:52:03.208,"Sweetheart, listen."
00:52:03.250,00:52:07.166,"Sometimes, with Daniel-- I'm coming, Dad."
00:52:10.125,00:52:12.583,Okay.
00:52:12.625,00:52:14.792,We'd better leave a note for your mother.
00:52:17.375,00:52:20.417,"JULI: In all the years, I'd never visited my Uncle Daniel."
00:52:20.458,00:52:24.875,I don't know why.
00:52:24.917,00:52:29.458,"We didn't say much to each other on the drive to Devonhurst, but I didn't care."
00:52:29.500,00:52:32.083,I just liked being with my dad.
00:52:32.125,00:52:35.959,Somehow the silence seemed to connect us in a way that words never could.
00:52:54.542,00:52:58.417,The residents tend to the grounds as part of their therapy.
00:53:01.458,00:53:05.417,It takes some getting used to.
00:53:06.834,00:53:09.125,Daniel?
00:53:09.166,00:53:11.125,Daniel.
00:53:11.166,00:53:14.500,Richard! You're here!
00:53:14.542,00:53:16.792,Richard for my birthday.
00:53:16.834,00:53:19.000,"Who? Richard, who? Who?"
00:53:19.041,00:53:20.834,"Who? Who? Richard, who? Who?"
00:53:20.875,00:53:24.250,"Daniel, Daniel, it's Julianna."
00:53:24.291,00:53:25.834,Your niece.
00:53:27.667,00:53:29.458,Julianna.
00:53:29.500,00:53:32.250,"-Ha, Julianna."
00:53:32.291,00:53:35.667,Ha-ha-ha. Richard. It's my birthday.
00:53:35.709,00:53:38.959,"I have your pictures, Julianna."
00:53:39.000,00:53:41.917,We have a present for you.
00:53:41.959,00:53:43.500,"A puzzle? A puzzle, Richard?"
00:53:43.542,00:53:45.291,Not just a puzzle.
00:53:45.333,00:53:48.500,A puzzle and a...
00:53:48.542,00:53:49.667,...pinwheel.
00:53:49.709,00:53:53.125,"A pinwheel! Thank you, Richard."
00:53:53.166,00:53:54.667,Yes.
00:53:57.417,00:53:59.667,"Orange. Outside? Outside, Richard?"
00:53:59.709,00:54:02.834,You wanna go outside?
00:54:02.875,00:54:05.458,-We'll walk out there for an ice cream.
00:54:05.500,00:54:08.250,"Oh, no. No, no, we can't."
00:54:08.291,00:54:10.667,Daniel doesn't like ice cream.
00:54:10.709,00:54:12.291,Aw.
00:54:13.834,00:54:17.500,"-I do like ice cream, Richard."
00:54:17.542,00:54:19.375,-I know you like ice cream.
00:54:19.417,00:54:21.792,"You love ice cream. All right, come on."
00:54:28.083,00:54:30.041,-Here you go. Got it?
00:54:30.083,00:54:31.375,Here you go.
00:54:31.417,00:54:33.208,It's my birthday.
00:54:38.041,00:54:40.041,Lollipop. It's my birthday.
00:54:45.000,00:54:46.750,You like it? Oh!
00:54:48.667,00:54:51.625,"-All right, Daniel. Okay, wait, wait."
00:54:51.667,00:54:54.417,-My ice cream. My ice cream.
00:54:55.417,00:54:57.583,Daniel!
00:54:57.625,00:55:01.417,"Daniel! Leave it, I'll get y-- DANIEL: Ice cream on the floor."
00:55:01.458,00:55:03.959,Would you go get him another cone?
00:55:04.000,00:55:06.417,-Yeah.
00:55:06.458,00:55:09.458,"It's my birthday, Richard."
00:55:09.500,00:55:12.291,"Ice cream, Richard! Ice cream, Richard!"
00:55:12.333,00:55:14.041,Stop! Stop it!
00:55:14.083,00:55:15.709,-I need it!
00:55:18.000,00:55:20.083,-Here we go.
00:55:20.125,00:55:21.750,Aah!
00:55:21.792,00:55:25.125,-Richard!
00:55:26.750,00:55:29.917,"Birthday ice cream. That's good, Richard."
00:55:29.959,00:55:32.709,I'm so sorry.
00:55:32.750,00:55:36.667,JULI: I'd often heard my father talk about how difficult life was for Daniel.
00:55:36.709,00:55:39.500,But I never really understood it until now.
00:55:40.625,00:55:43.125,"-Yeah, there you go."
00:55:43.166,00:55:45.959,"JULI: On the walk back, Daniel acted like nothing had happened."
00:55:46.000,00:55:48.417,Other way. Other way.
00:55:48.458,00:55:51.041,"JULI: On the ride home, my dad told me that Uncle Daniel..."
00:55:51.083,00:55:54.041,...used to live with him and Mom before we were born.
00:55:54.083,00:55:56.959,"But after a while, it became too difficult."
00:55:58.500,00:56:01.458,"When we got home, everything looked the same."
00:56:01.500,00:56:03.542,But it wasn't.
00:56:03.583,00:56:06.834,"Before today, Daniel had always been just a name to me."
00:56:06.875,00:56:09.083,Now he was part of the family.
00:56:16.166,00:56:18.000,-Hey.
00:56:21.542,00:56:23.458,How'd it go?
00:56:23.500,00:56:24.709,I'm glad I went.
00:56:24.750,00:56:27.417,I'm glad you went too.
00:56:27.458,00:56:32.375,"Trina, it's Sunday."
00:56:32.417,00:56:36.250,Patty Loski invited us over for dinner Friday night.
00:56:36.291,00:56:38.583,RICHARD: Shouldn't she be mopping her floor?
00:56:38.625,00:56:40.667,Or did she ask to borrow ours?
00:56:42.291,00:56:44.542,Nervous energy.
00:56:44.583,00:56:47.041,-Did she invite all of us?
00:56:47.083,00:56:50.542,Even our friend Sal Monella?
00:56:50.583,00:56:51.792,Richard.
00:56:51.834,00:56:54.583,"Why, after all these years?"
00:56:54.625,00:56:59.709,"Well, she said she felt really bad that they hadn't invited us before..."
00:56:59.750,00:57:02.875,...and apparently they want to get to know us better.
00:57:02.917,00:57:05.333,And you wanna go?
00:57:05.375,00:57:08.208,"Well, she insisted."
00:57:08.250,00:57:10.542,And I think it would be really nice.
00:57:12.625,00:57:14.333,All right.
00:57:14.375,00:57:16.542,We'll go.
00:57:16.583,00:57:18.917,JULI: I wasn't too thrilled about dinner with the Loskis...
00:57:18.959,00:57:22.166,...but I could see it meant a lot to my mother.
00:57:23.792,00:57:26.500,"At school the next day, I couldn't seem to concentrate."
00:57:26.542,00:57:29.125,My thoughts kept running back to Daniel.
00:57:29.166,00:57:32.709,I wondered what my grandparents had gone through having a son like him...
00:57:32.750,00:57:34.250,...when reality interrupted.
00:57:34.291,00:57:36.959,-Bryce Loski likes you.
00:57:37.000,00:57:39.125,He's got a big crush on you.
00:57:39.166,00:57:42.417,What are you talking about?
00:57:42.458,00:57:45.083,"Oh, yeah?"
00:57:45.125,00:57:47.750,He said it was because there was a bee in your hair.
00:57:47.792,00:57:49.709,Is that the lamest cover-up or what?
00:57:50.792,00:57:52.166,Maybe there was a bee.
00:57:52.208,00:57:55.709,The only bee you're attracting is B-R-Y-C-E.
00:57:55.750,00:57:59.083,"I'm telling you, that boy is lost in love land."
00:57:59.125,00:58:00.750,-Come on.
00:58:00.792,00:58:03.291,I saw him sneaking off with Garrett.
00:58:05.125,00:58:08.250,GARRETT: Are you freaking mental?
00:58:08.291,00:58:10.333,BRYCE: That's what's so weird. I don't think I do.
00:58:10.375,00:58:11.959,I can't stop thinking about her.
00:58:12.000,00:58:14.667,"GARRETT: You got it bad, man."
00:58:14.709,00:58:16.333,GARRETT: You gotta nip this in the bud.
00:58:16.375,00:58:18.792,-These aren't real emotions.
00:58:18.834,00:58:21.041,GARRETT: You feel guilty because of the egg thing.
00:58:21.083,00:58:22.709,"BRYCE: Yeah, and I insulted her yard."
00:58:22.750,00:58:25.125,GARRETT: Exactly. The place is a dump anyways.
00:58:25.166,00:58:28.917,BRYCE: Her dad's got a retarded brother and all their money goes to helping him.
00:58:28.959,00:58:31.417,GARRETT: A retard?
00:58:31.458,00:58:34.250,BRYCE: About what?
00:58:34.291,00:58:35.917,BRYCE: What are you saying?
00:58:35.959,00:58:38.250,"GARRETT: The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, my friend."
00:58:38.291,00:58:41.750,"BRYCE: Oh, heh. Yeah. Right."
00:58:41.792,00:58:43.750,BRYCE: I'll talk to you later.
00:58:43.792,00:58:45.125,GARRETT: Okay.
00:58:48.000,00:58:53.083,I'm sorry. I thought-- It's okay. It's fine.
00:58:53.125,00:58:54.625,JULI: And it was.
00:58:54.667,00:58:56.875,Because now my confusion was gone.
00:58:56.917,00:59:01.250,I was sure I no longer liked Bryce Loski.
00:59:04.083,00:59:07.291,"Mom, are you trying to make the Bakers feel totally worthless?"
00:59:07.333,00:59:10.417,I want it to be nice.
00:59:10.458,00:59:12.959,-And why aren't you dressed?
00:59:15.125,00:59:17.542,BRYCE: I wanted to look good for Juli.
00:59:17.583,00:59:21.375,But I didn't want her to think that I wanted to look good for her.
00:59:21.417,00:59:23.458,It was a fine line.
00:59:28.208,00:59:30.709,A very fine line.
00:59:33.083,00:59:35.959,"PATSY: Bryce, they're here. Come on down."
00:59:36.000,00:59:37.458,Coming!
00:59:39.083,00:59:40.875,"Hey, come on in."
00:59:40.917,00:59:43.500,"PATSY: Come in, come in."
00:59:43.542,00:59:46.417,I'm glad you could make it.
00:59:46.458,00:59:48.917,LYNETTA: Coming!
00:59:48.959,00:59:51.917,"Yes, it's pecan and blueberry cheesecake."
00:59:51.959,00:59:53.542,Let's take them to the kitchen.
00:59:53.583,00:59:55.125,"-Hi, guys."
00:59:55.166,00:59:57.166,-This is my dad.
00:59:57.208,00:59:59.792,"-Hi, nice to finally meet you."
00:59:59.834,01:00:02.125,"-My boys are telling me that-- STEVEN: Hey, big guy."
01:00:02.166,01:00:03.959,"Hey, Steven. How are you?"
01:00:04.000,01:00:07.041,We should've done this a long time ago.
01:00:07.083,01:00:08.667,This is a cool place.
01:00:08.709,01:00:12.375,"Yeah, it's all right."
01:00:12.417,01:00:14.500,MATT: You gotta hear this new song we wrote.
01:00:14.542,01:00:15.917,MARK: It's so good.
01:00:15.959,01:00:17.333,Hi.
01:00:22.875,01:00:25.000,You look nice.
01:00:25.041,01:00:28.125,I heard you and Garrett making fun of my uncle in the library.
01:00:28.166,01:00:30.083,And I don't wanna speak to you.
01:00:30.125,01:00:32.083,"Not now, not ever."
01:00:34.625,01:00:37.125,CHET: And I say you can.
01:00:37.166,01:00:41.792,"...would require a perpetual-motion machine, so it's not possible."
01:00:41.834,01:00:45.417,If you had two opposite charged poles with a neutral conductor....
01:00:45.458,01:00:47.375,BRYCE: Perpetual motion?
01:00:47.417,01:00:50.667,"Here I was, dying inside, and they were talking about perpetual motion."
01:00:50.709,01:00:52.875,And how did Juli know about all that stuff?
01:00:52.917,01:00:55.792,"Come on, everybody, dinner's ready."
01:00:55.834,01:00:57.333,Dinner!
01:00:57.375,01:00:58.542,"Juli, can I talk to you?"
01:01:02.166,01:01:05.583,"It was wrong, what Garrett said."
01:01:05.625,01:01:08.000,Did you know it was wrong when he said it?
01:01:08.041,01:01:11.041,Yeah. I wanted to punch him.
01:01:11.083,01:01:13.291,But we were in the library.
01:01:13.333,01:01:16.375,So instead you just agreed with him and laughed.
01:01:16.417,01:01:17.959,Yeah.
01:01:19.583,01:01:21.583,Then that makes you a coward.
01:01:25.709,01:01:28.709,BRYCE: I had to sit across from Juli for an entire dinner.
01:01:28.750,01:01:30.625,My dad was right.
01:01:30.667,01:01:32.959,We should have barbecued.
01:01:33.000,01:01:36.583,I just want to say how wonderful it is to have you share a meal with us.
01:01:36.625,01:01:38.750,May it be the first of many.
01:01:40.667,01:01:41.667,Wrong pipe.
01:01:43.500,01:01:45.750,"Well, we couldn't be happier."
01:01:45.792,01:01:49.125,We are just all so thrilled to be here.
01:01:58.792,01:02:02.000,"Juli, you did a really nice job on your yard."
01:02:02.041,01:02:05.542,Thanks. Chet was a big help.
01:02:05.583,01:02:07.417,"STEVEN: Yeah, I know."
01:02:07.458,01:02:10.333,You gotta tell me your secret.
01:02:10.375,01:02:12.834,-Steven.
01:02:15.125,01:02:20.542,"I'm telling you, the neighborhood is really coming to life."
01:02:20.583,01:02:23.792,"I mean, that new house is taking shape."
01:02:23.834,01:02:25.625,Which one?
01:02:25.667,01:02:29.542,"You know, the one where they cut down that big ugly tree."
01:02:29.583,01:02:34.250,"BRYCE: I wanted to say that a lot of people liked that tree, but I didn't."
01:02:34.291,01:02:36.792,I didn't want to go against my dad.
01:02:36.834,01:02:40.542,Some people thought that tree was the jewel of the neighborhood.
01:02:40.583,01:02:43.417,"Yeah, well, there's no accounting for taste."
01:02:46.000,01:02:49.458,"So, Matt, Mark, Mark, Matt...."
01:02:49.500,01:02:52.041,"You guys are, uh, gonna be graduating soon, huh?"
01:02:52.083,01:02:54.875,"Yeah, thank God."
01:02:54.917,01:02:57.125,You don't like high school?
01:02:57.166,01:02:59.750,-You kidding?
01:02:59.792,01:03:03.250,High school was the best time of my life.
01:03:03.291,01:03:06.709,"-Not for us, no."
01:03:06.750,01:03:08.208,Ah.
01:03:08.250,01:03:11.291,"So college is probably out of the question, huh?"
01:03:11.333,01:03:12.583,"No, it's a possibility."
01:03:12.625,01:03:14.333,They've actually been accepted...
01:03:14.375,01:03:16.792,-...at several places already.
01:03:16.834,01:03:18.625,Really?
01:03:18.667,01:03:21.083,"Well, that's good."
01:03:21.125,01:03:25.083,"But, um, we're gonna give music a shot first."
01:03:25.125,01:03:28.709,-Really?
01:03:28.750,01:03:30.917,"Oh, their band is really boss."
01:03:30.959,01:03:34.041,They did a bunch of demos and they're really cool.
01:03:34.083,01:03:35.750,"Thanks, Lyn."
01:03:35.792,01:03:38.625,"When Steven and I first met, he was playing in a band."
01:03:38.667,01:03:40.917,You played in a band?
01:03:40.959,01:03:44.959,He was a wonderful saxophone player.
01:03:45.000,01:03:47.792,-Cool. You still play?
01:03:45.000,01:03:50.583,"-Well, I-- Well, if you want, you can come jam out with us sometime."
01:03:52.166,01:03:55.625,"Uh, you-- No, I mean-- Heh."
01:03:55.667,01:03:57.625,That's not me anymore.
01:03:57.667,01:04:00.083,PATSY: Have you boys ever performed in front of an audience?
01:04:00.125,01:04:02.250,MATT: A lot of times.
01:04:02.291,01:04:04.125,BRYCE: The more Matt and Mark talked about their musical exploits...
01:04:04.166,01:04:06.542,...the quieter my dad got.
01:04:06.583,01:04:09.333,He tried to plaster on a smile now and then...
01:04:09.375,01:04:12.041,...but underneath he seemed really sad.
01:04:13.417,01:04:16.375,But my parents didn't like him at first.
01:04:16.417,01:04:19.166,Republicans fought like crazy against the New Deal.
01:04:19.208,01:04:22.542,BRYCE: The rest of the evening was painless enough.
01:04:22.583,01:04:26.667,"But through it all, Juli didn't say a word to me."
01:04:26.709,01:04:29.125,Never even looked at me.
01:04:30.417,01:04:33.542,Until she was about to leave.
01:04:33.583,01:04:36.208,I'm sorry I was so angry when we first came in.
01:04:36.250,01:04:38.959,I think everyone had a good time.
01:04:39.000,01:04:41.458,Your mom was really nice to invite us.
01:04:43.500,01:04:44.875,See you.
01:04:44.917,01:04:46.792,BRYCE: Her apology made things worse.
01:04:46.834,01:04:51.041,"-Hey, wait for me."
01:04:51.083,01:04:54.375,It was like I wasn't even important enough to hold a grudge against.
01:04:54.417,01:04:56.875,"Well, I think they're a delightful family."
01:04:56.917,01:04:59.500,Those boys were nothing like I expected.
01:04:59.542,01:05:01.750,I thought they were very nice young men.
01:05:01.792,01:05:03.709,-Hoodlums.
01:05:03.750,01:05:06.333,How you think they can afford all that recording gear?
01:05:06.375,01:05:10.375,"Steven, please."
01:05:10.417,01:05:12.709,"Don't be so naive, Patsy."
01:05:12.750,01:05:15.834,Do you know how expensive it is to record a demo?
01:05:15.875,01:05:18.333,"They're probably stealing hubcaps, for chrissake."
01:05:18.375,01:05:21.333,You are such an asshole.
01:05:21.375,01:05:23.166,What is the matter with you?
01:05:25.083,01:05:26.834,Go to hell.
01:05:26.875,01:05:29.166,Don't you talk to me like that.
01:05:29.208,01:05:30.500,"Steven, stop!"
01:05:30.542,01:05:32.417,STEVEN: Nobody talks to me like that...
01:05:32.458,01:05:34.625,-...in my own house!
01:05:34.667,01:05:39.041,"BRYCE: I'd seen my father angry before, but this was different."
01:05:39.083,01:05:41.291,As I lay in bed that night...
01:05:41.333,01:05:44.125,...I thought about how my dad always looked down on the Bakers.
01:05:44.166,01:05:48.291,And how he'd called them trash and made fun of Mr. Baker's paintings.
01:05:48.333,01:05:51.041,And now I realized he was just mad at himself.
01:05:51.083,01:05:52.875,But why?
01:05:52.917,01:05:55.208,Juli called me a coward.
01:05:55.250,01:05:58.417,Was it possible my dad was a coward too?
01:05:58.458,01:06:00.417,I didn't know.
01:06:00.458,01:06:02.166,What difference did it make?
01:06:02.208,01:06:04.375,Juli Baker was out of my life.
01:06:04.417,01:06:06.375,"Or, more accurately..."
01:06:06.417,01:06:09.166,...I was out of hers.
01:06:09.208,01:06:11.917,JULI: As I was getting dressed for the Loskis' dinner party...
01:06:11.959,01:06:15.125,...I found myself staring at the painting my father had given me...
01:06:15.166,01:06:17.458,...and became furious all over again.
01:06:17.500,01:06:20.417,"Bryce had never been a friend to me, ever."
01:06:20.458,01:06:22.583,He hadn't taken my side about the tree...
01:06:22.625,01:06:24.250,...he'd thrown away my eggs...
01:06:24.291,01:06:27.500,...and he made fun of me at my uncle's expense.
01:06:27.542,01:06:29.542,When my mother called that it was time to go...
01:06:29.583,01:06:32.041,"TRINA: Juli, let's go, we're late!"
01:06:32.083,01:06:35.625,JULI: ...I went out with every intention of telling her that I wasn't going to the Loskis.
01:06:35.667,01:06:39.250,Please hold these. I need to check my hair really quickly one more time.
01:06:39.291,01:06:41.000,-Your hair is perfect.
01:06:41.041,01:06:43.291,JULI: But she looked so happy...
01:06:43.333,01:06:46.917,...and she'd gone to so much trouble over the pies that I couldn't.
01:06:46.959,01:06:49.792,"Ooh! Oh, my gosh."
01:06:49.834,01:06:51.792,"Okay. Here, hold one, and you hold this."
01:06:51.834,01:06:54.500,-I don't wanna hold it.
01:06:54.542,01:06:56.375,"Let's go, boys."
01:06:56.417,01:06:58.542,JULI: But that didn't mean I had to be nice to Bryce.
01:06:58.583,01:07:00.250,And I don't wanna speak to you.
01:07:00.291,01:07:02.917,"Not now, not ever."
01:07:02.959,01:07:04.750,JULI: It felt good to take charge.
01:07:04.792,01:07:08.291,"I felt strong, in control."
01:07:08.333,01:07:12.500,...and I was determined not to talk to him for the rest of the evening.
01:07:12.542,01:07:16.792,At dinner it struck me that we were sharing a meal with a group of strangers.
01:07:16.834,01:07:19.750,We'd lived across the street from the Loskis for years...
01:07:19.792,01:07:24.667,"...but except for Chet, I didn't know these people at all."
01:07:24.709,01:07:27.542,Mr. Loski was clean and smooth on the outside...
01:07:27.583,01:07:31.500,...but it seemed like there was something rotten buried just beneath the surface.
01:07:34.208,01:07:38.792,"By the end of the evening, all I felt was detached, neutral."
01:07:38.834,01:07:41.375,"No fireworks, no leftover anger..."
01:07:41.417,01:07:43.875,"...no flutters, nothing."
01:07:43.917,01:07:46.333,See you.
01:07:46.375,01:07:48.542,JULI: I went to bed that night feeling peaceful.
01:07:48.583,01:07:50.041,-You okay?
01:07:50.083,01:07:52.208,I was grateful that I had the family I had.
01:07:54.125,01:07:57.625,And it felt good to no longer care about Bryce Loski.
01:08:03.709,01:08:06.917,BRYCE: The dinner with the Bakers had taken its toll on me.
01:08:06.959,01:08:09.667,Then the annual school fundraiser arrived...
01:08:09.709,01:08:13.041,...and I found myself with a whole new set of problems.
01:08:14.625,01:08:17.166,I was a Basketboy.
01:08:17.208,01:08:20.083,To fully appreciate the humiliation of being a Basketboy...
01:08:20.125,01:08:24.333,...you need to know that the chosen few are auctioned off in front of the student body...
01:08:24.375,01:08:26.417,...to the highest-bidding females.
01:08:26.458,01:08:29.166,"Yes, technically, each of us comes with a lunch in a basket..."
01:08:29.208,01:08:32.583,...but let's not kid ourselves.
01:08:32.625,01:08:34.417,"There he is, my idol."
01:08:34.458,01:08:36.041,"One word, you're a dead man."
01:08:36.083,01:08:38.417,"No, man, I'm serious."
01:08:38.458,01:08:39.917,What?
01:08:39.959,01:08:42.208,Two of the hottest chicks are fighting over you.
01:08:42.250,01:08:45.250,-What are you talking about?
01:08:45.291,01:08:47.709,She and Melanie are having a bidding war over you.
01:08:47.750,01:08:49.375,I don't care.
01:08:49.417,01:08:52.542,Are you nuts?
01:08:52.583,01:08:54.333,You're my idol.
01:08:54.375,01:08:56.542,BRYCE: As comforting as it was to be Garrett's idol...
01:08:56.583,01:09:00.208,...it didn't diminish the horror of being Basketboy number nine.
01:09:00.250,01:09:04.834,And my only hope was that a giant tornado would destroy the school before the event.
01:09:04.875,01:09:06.583,It was a long shot.
01:09:07.834,01:09:09.792,"Welcome, everyone..."
01:09:09.834,01:09:14.625,...to this year's Mayfield Boosters Club Auction.
01:09:14.667,01:09:17.458,Once again we are pleased to present...
01:09:17.500,01:09:21.083,-...20 of Mayfield's finest young men....
01:09:21.125,01:09:23.458,-What are you doing here?
01:09:23.500,01:09:26.500,-So?
01:09:26.542,01:09:27.750,-Bullshit.
01:09:27.792,01:09:29.542,I saw her counting it by her locker.
01:09:29.583,01:09:31.166,McCLURE: And now...
01:09:31.208,01:09:34.250,...please give a big Mayfield School welcome...
01:09:34.291,01:09:38.583,...to your 1963 Basketboys.
01:09:43.041,01:09:46.166,BRYCE: Juli with cash? What did this mean?
01:09:46.208,01:09:48.583,Was it possible she was gonna bid on me?
01:09:48.625,01:09:50.917,"First up, we have..."
01:09:50.959,01:09:53.333,...Raymond Hughes.
01:09:53.375,01:09:55.166,Raymond's on the chess team...
01:09:55.208,01:09:59.625,...and his hobbies include stamp collecting and the yo-yo.
01:09:59.667,01:10:01.375,"Remember, when you bid..."
01:10:01.417,01:10:04.917,...you'll not only be getting the handsome Mr. Hughes...
01:10:04.959,01:10:07.834,...you'll also be enjoying...
01:10:07.875,01:10:10.834,...a lovely chicken-salad sandwich...
01:10:10.875,01:10:18.500,"...and what looks to be a tasty bean dip, and-- Oh. Excuse me, onion dip."
01:10:18.542,01:10:21.333,And a big slice of cherry pie.
01:10:21.375,01:10:24.208,"Okay, who will start the bidding at $5?"
01:10:25.750,01:10:28.000,BRYCE: Thus began the bidding.
01:10:28.041,01:10:31.250,"BRYCE: Or in Raymond Hughes' case, the lack of bidding."
01:10:32.417,01:10:34.333,"Very good, here we go."
01:10:35.333,01:10:37.000,-Five.
01:10:37.041,01:10:38.583,-Ten dollars.
01:10:38.625,01:10:41.417,-Fifteen.
01:10:41.458,01:10:43.792,Come on. Do I hear 10?
01:10:43.834,01:10:45.792,GIRL 1: Ten.
01:10:45.834,01:10:49.125,GIRL 3: Ten.
01:10:49.166,01:10:50.542,GIRL 4: Fifteen.
01:10:50.583,01:10:52.834,Sold for $15.
01:10:54.583,01:10:57.792,Number eight is Eddie Trulock.
01:10:57.834,01:11:00.625,Eddie is a member of the debate team.
01:11:00.667,01:11:04.750,BRYCE: Now only Eddie Trulock stood between me and the auction block.
01:11:04.792,01:11:07.750,I wasn't interested in his hobbies or what was in his basket.
01:11:07.792,01:11:11.166,McCLURE: Let's start the bidding at $5.
01:11:11.208,01:11:13.875,McCLURE: Anybody?
01:11:13.917,01:11:17.208,What if she got in a bidding war with Sherry and Melanie and lost out?
01:11:17.250,01:11:19.250,McCLURE: No bidders?
01:11:19.291,01:11:20.834,BRYCE: I was contemplating the horrors of this when....
01:11:20.875,01:11:23.125,JULI: Eight dollars.
01:11:23.166,01:11:26.458,"McCLURE: There you go. Eight dollars, that's more like it. Do I hear 10?"
01:11:26.500,01:11:28.625,BRYCE: Juli Baker was bidding on Eddie Trulock?
01:11:28.667,01:11:31.250,"McCLURE: Okay, 8 going once."
01:11:31.291,01:11:33.917,McCLURE: Eight going twice.
01:11:33.959,01:11:36.500,Sold to Juli Baker.
01:11:40.417,01:11:44.875,"Next is Basketboy number nine, Bryce Loski."
01:11:44.917,01:11:49.208,"BRYCE: I knew I was supposed to step forward, but I couldn't move."
01:11:49.250,01:11:52.000,"McCLURE: Step up, Bryce, don't be shy."
01:11:53.417,01:11:56.125,"Better late than never. Ha, ha."
01:11:56.166,01:11:58.333,Bryce likes to play baseball.
01:11:58.375,01:12:00.625,-Five dollars.
01:11:58.375,01:12:02.291,"McCLURE: Oh, well, wait until I-- -Ten."
01:12:02.333,01:12:04.333,"Well, it appears the bidding is underway."
01:12:04.375,01:12:05.959,-Fifteen.
01:12:06.000,01:12:07.625,SHERRY: Twenty-five.
01:12:07.667,01:12:10.458,-Thirty-five.
01:12:10.500,01:12:12.917,-Fifty.
01:12:12.959,01:12:16.792,Fifty dollars. Wh-- Fifty going once.
01:12:17.959,01:12:20.458,Fifty going twice.
01:12:20.500,01:12:24.250,Sold to Miss Sherry Stalls for $50.
01:12:24.291,01:12:27.083,An all-time record.
01:12:27.125,01:12:31.375,"Oh, the boosters will be very grateful for such a generous donation."
01:12:31.417,01:12:33.583,BRYCE: It's strange.
01:12:33.625,01:12:36.583,"Here I was, having lunch with the hottest girl in school..."
01:12:36.625,01:12:38.333,...and I was miserable.
01:12:38.375,01:12:40.834,We're going up to the lake.
01:12:40.875,01:12:43.166,...and you get the most outrageous tan.
01:12:43.208,01:12:46.709,BRYCE: Because less than 20 feet away from me was Juli.
01:12:46.750,01:12:50.250,My Juli with Eddie Trulock.
01:12:50.291,01:12:52.250,She's laughing.
01:12:52.291,01:12:54.291,What was she laughing about?
01:12:54.333,01:12:58.834,How could she sit there and laugh and look so beautiful?
01:12:58.875,01:13:00.625,"Bryce, are you all right?"
01:13:01.875,01:13:03.333,What?
01:13:03.375,01:13:05.625,What are you staring at?
01:13:05.667,01:13:07.333,Nothing.
01:13:09.083,01:13:11.291,"Lunch is really delicious, Bryce."
01:13:15.542,01:13:16.875,"Bryce, did you hear me?"
01:13:16.917,01:13:19.875,This is a really delicious lunch.
01:13:19.917,01:13:22.208,Can we not talk about tans or food?
01:13:23.625,01:13:25.834,"Well, what do you wanna talk about?"
01:13:25.875,01:13:30.000,"I don't know, perpetual motion?"
01:13:30.041,01:13:31.375,Perpetual what?
01:13:35.041,01:13:38.667,BRYCE: I don't know what came over me.
01:13:38.709,01:13:41.834,"-Juli, I gotta talk to you."
01:13:44.709,01:13:45.917,"What's going on, Bryce?"
01:13:49.041,01:13:50.250,What are you doing?
01:13:52.166,01:13:53.917,"Bryce, stop it."
01:13:53.959,01:13:56.166,"BOY: Bryce, you didn't even make it to first base."
01:13:56.208,01:13:58.083,"GIRL: I'll kiss you. Ha, ha."
01:13:58.125,01:14:00.750,Juli! Juli!
01:14:02.792,01:14:05.583,"Juli, wait. Can we talk?"
01:14:05.625,01:14:07.291,Juli!
01:14:07.333,01:14:09.834,-What's the matter with you?
01:14:09.875,01:14:14.458,You get a date with the finest girl on campus and you blow it for Juli.
01:14:14.500,01:14:18.375,-You wouldn't understand!
01:14:18.417,01:14:20.333,We're talking about Juli Baker here.
01:14:20.375,01:14:23.250,"Nightmare neighbor, know-it-all nuisance."
01:14:23.291,01:14:25.125,Shut up!
01:14:25.166,01:14:27.917,"Hey, have you flipped?"
01:14:27.959,01:14:32.291,"You know what, if you're gonna be like this, I don't need the association."
01:14:32.333,01:14:35.667,"-Well, good, because neither do I."
01:14:38.417,01:14:42.250,BRYCE: As I walked home with the dirty dishes clanking inside my picnic basket...
01:14:42.291,01:14:44.709,...all I could think of was Juli.
01:14:44.750,01:14:50.792,And I realized Garrett was right about one thing: I had flipped. Completely.
01:15:02.458,01:15:03.625,Hello?
01:15:03.667,01:15:06.917,"Oh, heh. Hi, Mrs. Baker. Is Juli there?"
01:15:06.959,01:15:11.041,"TRINA: Oh. I'm sorry, Bryce."
01:15:16.375,01:15:18.542,"Please, Mrs. Baker. I gotta see her."
01:15:18.583,01:15:20.959,"I'm sorry, Bryce."
01:15:21.000,01:15:23.583,But I'm afraid she's locked herself in her room.
01:15:29.625,01:15:32.166,BRYCE: I tried to go to bed early that night...
01:15:32.208,01:15:34.417,...but I couldn't sleep.
01:15:34.458,01:15:37.834,I watched her house from my window for hours.
01:15:37.875,01:15:40.875,I had to find a way to show her how I felt.
01:15:43.291,01:15:45.667,"JULI: Monday morning, as I made my way into school..."
01:15:45.709,01:15:49.125,...I was deciding which of the Everly Brothers I'd rather marry...
01:15:49.166,01:15:52.041,...when Dana Tressler forced Bryce back into my brain.
01:15:52.083,01:15:54.917,Juli. The list is out.
01:15:54.959,01:15:57.542,"There he is, number nine, your main dish."
01:15:57.583,01:15:59.417,Bryce Loski's not my main dish.
01:15:59.458,01:16:03.250,"-Oh, you're sticking to your diet."
01:16:03.291,01:16:06.125,"-I'm over him, okay?"
01:16:06.166,01:16:09.792,Because rumor has it Sherry's already staking her claim on him.
01:16:09.834,01:16:12.250,Sherry? Sherry Stalls?
01:16:12.291,01:16:14.709,"Oh, Liz. Macy. The list is up."
01:16:18.417,01:16:23.041,"JULI: That afternoon, I found myself obsessing about the Basketboy auction."
01:16:23.083,01:16:25.875,I could feel myself backsliding about Bryce.
01:16:25.917,01:16:28.333,But why should I care if Sherry liked him?
01:16:28.375,01:16:31.125,I shouldn't even be thinking about him.
01:16:31.166,01:16:32.792,I had to rise above this.
01:16:32.834,01:16:35.041,Bryce Loski was no longer in my life.
01:16:37.125,01:16:40.959,"On the morning of the auction, I was on edge."
01:16:41.000,01:16:45.291,"I found myself, without even knowing how it happened, staring at my egg money."
01:16:45.333,01:16:47.000,I needed a strategy.
01:16:47.041,01:16:48.875,It was simple.
01:16:48.917,01:16:52.834,"If I left my money at home, I'd leave temptation with it."
01:16:52.875,01:16:56.041,My strategy suffered a setback when I ran into Mrs. Steuby.
01:16:56.083,01:16:57.625,STEUBY: Julianna.
01:16:57.667,01:16:59.375,Julianna.
01:16:59.417,01:17:02.208,"Hello, dear."
01:17:02.250,01:17:05.125,I'm so sorry it's taken me so long to get this to you...
01:17:05.166,01:17:07.917,...but I keep missing you in the morning.
01:17:07.959,01:17:10.417,"Mrs. Steuby, I don't want that."
01:17:07.959,01:17:12.625,You don't have to-- Don't be ridiculous. I'm gonna pay you.
01:17:12.667,01:17:15.625,-I'm going to pay you.
01:17:15.667,01:17:18.959,"Yeah, I want you to go out and buy yourself something festive."
01:17:19.000,01:17:20.208,"Pedal pushers. Ha, ha."
01:17:20.250,01:17:22.333,-Mrs. Steuby.
01:17:22.375,01:17:25.417,"-Mrs. Steuby, I don't want pedal pushers."
01:17:28.291,01:17:30.208,It's okay.
01:17:30.250,01:17:34.000,It's okay. No big deal.
01:17:34.041,01:17:36.291,I hear you're planning to bid on Bryce.
01:17:36.333,01:17:38.208,"What? Who told you that? No, I'm not."
01:17:38.250,01:17:40.625,Someone saw you with a wad of cash this morning.
01:17:40.667,01:17:43.375,-How much do you have?
01:17:43.417,01:17:46.458,"And I'm not bidding, okay?"
01:17:46.500,01:17:48.291,"Oh, that'll be the day."
01:17:48.333,01:17:52.250,"It's true. Go ahead, waste your money on him. I don't care."
01:17:52.291,01:17:57.250,"And now, will you all give a big Mayfield School welcome..."
01:17:57.291,01:18:02.000,...to your 1963 Basketboys.
01:18:02.041,01:18:04.166,JULI: I could say I didn't care all I wanted...
01:18:04.208,01:18:07.000,...but seeing Bryce walk out in his jacket and tie...
01:18:07.041,01:18:09.000,...holding that picnic basket...
01:18:09.041,01:18:11.834,...set my head spinning again.
01:18:11.875,01:18:14.166,Fifteen going once.
01:18:14.208,01:18:17.917,JULI: The auction seemed to fly by.
01:18:17.959,01:18:22.125,Sold to Macy Taylor for $15.
01:18:22.166,01:18:25.125,"JULI: Before I knew it, Eddie Trulock was called."
01:18:25.166,01:18:28.458,Number eight is Eddie Trulock.
01:18:28.500,01:18:30.083,JULI: Which meant Bryce was next.
01:18:30.125,01:18:32.417,McCLURE: Eddie is a member of the debate team.
01:18:32.458,01:18:35.792,And his hobbies include fishing...
01:18:35.834,01:18:39.125,...and model-airplane building.
01:18:39.166,01:18:41.250,Who will give me $5?
01:18:44.250,01:18:48.583,-Why isn't anyone bidding? He's so nice.
01:18:48.625,01:18:50.125,McCLURE: Nobody?
01:18:52.667,01:18:54.125,Eight dollars.
01:18:54.166,01:18:57.166,McCLURE: Sold to Juli Baker for $8.
01:18:57.208,01:18:59.208,JULI: How did this happen?
01:18:59.250,01:19:01.542,Was it because I felt bad for Eddie?
01:19:01.583,01:19:05.041,Or was it because I couldn't trust myself with Bryce?
01:19:05.083,01:19:07.458,As I made my way to the multi-purpose room...
01:19:07.500,01:19:10.375,...I contemplated the startling turn of events.
01:19:10.417,01:19:13.250,"Here I was, about to have lunch with Eddie Trulock..."
01:19:13.291,01:19:15.709,...while the boy I mooned over for half my life...
01:19:15.750,01:19:18.083,...was going to share a meal with my mortal enemy.
01:19:20.834,01:19:23.125,I wanna thank you for bidding on me.
01:19:23.166,01:19:25.417,It was touch-and-go there for a while.
01:19:25.458,01:19:28.208,"No, I wanted to. This will be fun."
01:19:37.458,01:19:40.208,-I hear you like building model airplanes.
01:19:40.250,01:19:44.250,My father and I just finished a Russian MiG-19. It was made in 1955.
01:19:44.291,01:19:47.875,MiG's first supersonic fighter.
01:19:47.917,01:19:49.959,JULI: I tried to give Eddie my full attention.
01:19:50.000,01:19:53.291,"But it was difficult, because Bryce was right behind him."
01:19:53.333,01:19:55.917,Eddie was saying something about intake valves...
01:19:55.959,01:20:00.417,"...when out of nowhere, Bryce stood up and marched straight towards me."
01:20:00.458,01:20:02.667,"Hey, Juli, I gotta talk to you."
01:20:09.834,01:20:11.458,What are you doing?
01:20:14.333,01:20:17.667,JULI: He was going to kiss me. To kiss me.
01:20:17.709,01:20:20.333,All my life I've been waiting for that kiss.
01:20:20.375,01:20:24.375,But not like this. Not this way.
01:20:24.417,01:20:27.792,"I pedaled home so hard, I thought my lungs would burst."
01:20:32.875,01:20:34.583,TRINA: Julianna?
01:20:37.041,01:20:38.667,Julianna.
01:20:41.709,01:20:43.250,Honey?
01:20:44.375,01:20:46.583,What's wrong?
01:20:46.625,01:20:48.250,I can't.
01:20:51.917,01:20:53.750,Sweetheart...
01:20:54.834,01:20:56.375,...you can tell me.
01:20:58.583,01:21:00.667,Bryce tried to kiss me.
01:21:01.917,01:21:03.667,He did?
01:21:03.709,01:21:05.041,In school.
01:21:06.125,01:21:08.000,In front of everybody.
01:21:09.709,01:21:11.667,"Mom, please don't get it."
01:21:11.709,01:21:13.458,It's probably him.
01:21:15.041,01:21:16.959,Sweetheart...
01:21:17.000,01:21:18.792,...maybe you should talk to him.
01:21:20.625,01:21:22.667,I can't.
01:21:22.709,01:21:24.458,I can't.
01:21:26.125,01:21:28.333,JULI: Bryce wouldn't leave me alone.
01:21:29.542,01:21:31.542,He kept calling on the phone.
01:21:33.792,01:21:36.542,And knocking on the door.
01:21:36.583,01:21:39.792,He even snuck around the house and tapped on my window.
01:21:39.834,01:21:41.959,"BRYCE: Juli! Please, I gotta see you!"
01:21:42.000,01:21:43.917,"Come on out, just for a minute!"
01:21:43.959,01:21:46.959,JULI: Why didn't he understand that I just wanted to be left alone?
01:21:47.000,01:21:48.542,BRYCE: Please!
01:21:51.125,01:21:53.667,"JULI: After two days, Bryce stopped."
01:21:53.709,01:21:55.959,And I thought it was finally over.
01:21:59.375,01:22:02.959,"Then, one afternoon, I was coming into the front room to read..."
01:22:05.542,01:22:07.583,...when I heard a noise in the yard.
01:22:12.125,01:22:13.583,"Hey, what's he doing?"
01:22:13.625,01:22:17.667,"Juli, calm down. I gave him permission."
01:22:17.709,01:22:21.625,Permission? Permission for what?
01:22:21.667,01:22:23.709,RICHARD: I told him he could.
01:22:23.750,01:22:25.417,JULI: But why?
01:22:25.458,01:22:27.583,RICHARD: I told him he could.
01:22:27.625,01:22:30.625,JULI: It was torture seeing him dig up my grass.
01:22:30.667,01:22:33.375,How could my father let him do this?
01:22:33.417,01:22:35.750,Bryce knew I was there too.
01:22:43.875,01:22:45.458,He's gone.
01:22:55.834,01:22:57.959,A tree?
01:22:58.000,01:22:59.834,He's planting a tree?
01:23:05.667,01:23:07.041,Is it a...?
01:23:07.083,01:23:09.375,JULI: I didn't really need to ask.
01:23:09.417,01:23:11.875,I could tell from the shape of the leaves...
01:23:11.917,01:23:14.333,...and the texture of the trunk.
01:23:14.375,01:23:16.458,It was a sycamore tree.
01:23:21.959,01:23:27.000,"BRYCE: When she walked out of the door, I thought back to the first time I saw her."
01:23:27.041,01:23:31.875,"How could anybody, ever, have wanted to run away from Juli Baker?"
01:23:31.917,01:23:34.166,JULI: He looked at me with those eyes.
01:23:34.208,01:23:36.542,Those once again dazzling eyes.
01:23:36.583,01:23:41.542,And I knew that Bryce Loski was still walking around with my first kiss.
01:23:41.583,01:23:44.625,But he wouldn't be for long.
01:23:44.667,01:23:48.208,"As we stood there, I realized that all these years..."
01:23:48.250,01:23:50.291,...we never really talked.
01:23:53.667,01:23:55.834,Do you need some help?
01:23:55.875,01:23:57.041,Yeah.
01:23:58.625,01:24:02.125,"JULI: But that day, we started."
01:24:02.166,01:24:04.917,BRYCE: And I knew we'd be talking for a long time.
