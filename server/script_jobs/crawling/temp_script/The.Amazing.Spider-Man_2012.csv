00:01:06.775,00:01:09.695,"Ready or not, here I come."
00:02:23.435,00:02:26.396,"Hey, Dad?"
00:02:26.396,00:02:28.649,Dad!
00:03:30.794,00:03:34.464,RICHARD: You'll stay with Aunt May and Uncle Ben for a little while.
00:03:34.464,00:03:37.009,I want to go with you.
00:03:40.179,00:03:45.642,"Doesn't like crust on his sandwiches, and he likes to sleep with a little light on at night."
00:03:45.642,00:03:48.228,"RICHARD: Mare, come on."
00:03:52.149,00:03:54.401,Dad.
00:03:54.401,00:03:56.444,Be good.
00:04:13.670,00:04:15.089,Sorry.
00:04:15.089,00:04:17.174,"Morning, Flash."
00:04:19.593,00:04:21.386,"Good morning, Parker."
00:04:27.726,00:04:30.437,"Hey. It's, uh..."
00:04:30.437,00:04:31.980,Mm-hmm.
00:04:31.980,00:04:33.732,I really like your photos.
00:04:33.732,00:04:35.192,"Oh, thanks. Thanks."
00:04:35.192,00:04:36.568,"Uh, listen, are..."
00:04:36.568,00:04:38.112,Are you busy Friday night?
00:04:39.404,00:04:41.782,Uh...
00:04:41.782,00:04:43.366,Heh-heh. Cool.
00:04:43.366,00:04:46.536,"Uh, can you take pictures of my boyfriend's car?"
00:04:46.536,00:04:50.040,"I just-- You know, I want to frame a good one for his birthday."
00:04:50.040,00:04:53.001,That's really nice of you.
00:04:53.001,00:04:57.756,"Um, yeah, I'll have a look at the old, uh-- The old schedule."
00:04:58.966,00:05:00.675,Parker.
00:05:00.675,00:05:02.219,Want to keep that skateboard?
00:05:02.219,00:05:03.720,Yeah.
00:05:03.720,00:05:05.346,Sure. Yeah.
00:05:05.346,00:05:06.514,Like that?
00:05:06.514,00:05:08.433,TEACHER: That's it.
00:05:34.126,00:05:37.629,Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!
00:05:37.629,00:05:40.257,Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!
00:05:40.257,00:05:42.801,"Eat your vegetables, Gordon."
00:05:42.801,00:05:45.804,Come on!
00:05:45.804,00:05:47.388,Get a picture of this.
00:05:47.388,00:05:49.224,I'm not going to take a picture.
00:05:49.224,00:05:50.934,"Put him down, man."
00:05:50.934,00:05:52.727,"Gordon, don't eat it."
00:05:52.727,00:05:55.230,"Take the picture, Parker."
00:05:55.230,00:05:57.482,FLASH: Take the picture.
00:05:57.482,00:06:00.277,"Put him down, Eugene!"
00:06:01.528,00:06:02.904,Whoa!
00:06:02.904,00:06:04.614,"Hey, man."
00:06:06.074,00:06:09.119,"Come on! Get up, Parker!"
00:06:09.119,00:06:11.830,Get up! Come on!
00:06:11.830,00:06:13.207,BOY: Get up.
00:06:15.959,00:06:18.253,I'm still not taking the picture.
00:06:18.253,00:06:20.130,"Stay down, Parker!"
00:06:20.130,00:06:21.548,Who wants one more?
00:06:21.548,00:06:23.842,One more! Huh? Huh?
00:06:23.842,00:06:27.428,"Flash, we still on for after school today?"
00:06:27.428,00:06:29.056,"My house, 3:30?"
00:06:29.056,00:06:31.225,I hope you've been doing your homework.
00:06:31.225,00:06:33.852,"Last time, I was very disappointed in you."
00:06:33.852,00:06:36.104,"No, Flash, how about we go to class?"
00:06:36.104,00:06:40.067,Hmm? How about it?
00:06:40.067,00:06:42.319,Whatever.
00:07:06.218,00:07:08.803,I thought that was great what you did out there.
00:07:08.803,00:07:12.599,"It was stupid, but it was great."
00:07:12.599,00:07:14.434,You should probably go to the nurse.
00:07:14.434,00:07:16.519,You might have a concussion.
00:07:17.562,00:07:19.522,What's your name?
00:07:19.522,00:07:21.149,You don't know my name?
00:07:21.149,00:07:22.984,"No, I know your name."
00:07:22.984,00:07:25.279,I just want to know if you know your name.
00:07:26.363,00:07:28.531,Peter.
00:07:28.531,00:07:30.284,Parker.
00:07:30.284,00:07:31.785,"Okay. Okay, good."
00:07:38.875,00:07:41.044,"I'd still go to the nurse, though."
00:07:41.044,00:07:42.421,"You're Gwen, right?"
00:07:42.421,00:07:43.797,Gwen Stacy.
00:07:43.797,00:07:46.216,All right.
00:07:46.216,00:07:47.759,PETER: Hey.
00:07:47.759,00:07:51.346,I'm making spaghetti and meatballs tonight.
00:07:51.346,00:07:53.848,You're serious?
00:07:53.848,00:07:58.353,"Since when don't you like spaghetti and meatballs, huh?"
00:07:58.353,00:07:59.980,"Oh, my God."
00:07:59.980,00:08:02.399,What happened to your face?
00:08:02.399,00:08:04.776,"Just... I fell, skating."
00:08:04.776,00:08:06.569,It's all right.
00:08:06.569,00:08:12.367,"MAY: Ben Parker, don't you even think about leaving that filthy box in my kitchen."
00:08:12.367,00:08:15.287,These are my bowling trophies.
00:08:12.367,00:08:16.997,"Then, by all means, please leave that in my kitchen."
00:08:16.997,00:08:18.665,What happened?
00:08:18.665,00:08:21.542,"Why you kids ride those things, I'll never know."
00:08:21.542,00:08:23.378,'Cause it's stupid and dangerous.
00:08:23.378,00:08:25.130,Remember when we were stupid?
00:08:25.130,00:08:26.798,No.
00:08:26.798,00:08:28.549,PETER: Good to know.
00:08:28.549,00:08:31.303,Where's the flood?
00:08:31.303,00:08:33.430,PETER: You serious?
00:08:33.430,00:08:35.098,All right.
00:08:35.098,00:08:37.392,BEN: I think it's the condenser tray.
00:08:37.392,00:08:41.062,"No, too much water for the condenser tray or the heat exchange tubing."
00:08:41.062,00:08:42.897,This has got to be the fill line.
00:08:42.897,00:08:45.066,That's the only thing that makes any sense.
00:08:45.066,00:08:46.901,Can you fix it?
00:08:46.901,00:08:50.655,"No, not tonight. I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow."
00:08:50.655,00:08:53.116,"Good deal. And meanwhile, put this on your face."
00:08:54.868,00:08:56.995,How's the other guy look?
00:08:58.705,00:09:01.791,Come on. I know a right cross when I see one.
00:09:01.791,00:09:05.379,Yes or no-- do I have to call somebody's father?
00:09:05.379,00:09:08.173,"No, no."
00:09:08.173,00:09:10.633,"Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May."
00:09:10.633,00:09:14.012,I pity the poor kid who'd have to suffer her wrath.
00:09:15.347,00:09:19.976,"Hey, before you come up, see if there's anything else worth saving."
00:09:35.742,00:09:37.618,BEN: Plumbers don't fix appliances.
00:09:37.618,00:09:41.039,"MAY: Yes, they fix appliances."
00:09:41.039,00:09:49.047,If you ask them to-- BEN: I forgot all about that thing.
00:09:49.047,00:09:50.965,It was your dad's.
00:09:50.965,00:09:53.676,He asked us to keep it safe for him.
00:09:56.388,00:10:00.058,He saw it in the window of that leather shop over on Ninth Avenue.
00:10:00.058,00:10:01.560,He was 19.
00:10:01.560,00:10:04.104,What does a 19-year-old kid need with a briefcase?
00:10:04.104,00:10:06.106,And guess who sold it to him.
00:10:06.106,00:10:07.982,I don't know.
00:10:07.982,00:10:09.817,That's how they met.
00:10:09.817,00:10:11.778,He asked you to keep this safe? Why?
00:10:11.778,00:10:13.238,There's nothing in here.
00:10:13.238,00:10:15.115,Have you looked?
00:10:15.115,00:10:17.451,"Your father was a very secretive man, Peter."
00:10:17.451,00:10:20.161,"Yeah, I know."
00:10:25.375,00:10:27.168,Who's that?
00:10:27.168,00:10:28.711,Do you know who that is?
00:10:28.711,00:10:31.672,"Some guy who worked with your dad, I guess."
00:10:36.261,00:10:38.430,"Just take this off the table, all right?"
00:10:38.430,00:10:40.474,We're going to eat. Off.
00:10:40.474,00:10:43.602,And wash your hands now.
00:10:43.602,00:10:44.936,Go on.
00:11:19.095,00:11:22.182,"RICHARD: I need you to be a good boy, Peter."
00:11:22.182,00:11:24.683,Where are you going?
00:11:24.683,00:11:26.936,something your mom and I have to do.
00:12:23.326,00:12:25.286,What is this?
00:12:27.955,00:12:30.584,"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."
00:12:32.960,00:12:34.879,"Yeah, one sec, one sec."
00:12:42.761,00:12:44.639,Come in.
00:12:44.639,00:12:46.099,You okay?
00:12:46.099,00:12:48.685,Yeah. What's up?
00:12:48.685,00:12:50.144,You look just like him.
00:12:50.144,00:12:51.438,Can I come in?
00:12:51.438,00:12:53.106,Yeah.
00:12:57.318,00:12:59.320,"Listen, um..."
00:12:59.320,00:13:01.072,I don't have much education.
00:13:01.072,00:13:02.657,"You know that, Peter."
00:13:02.657,00:13:06.453,"Hell, I stopped being able to help with your homework when you were 10."
00:13:06.453,00:13:09.163,"What I'm trying to say is, uh..."
00:13:09.163,00:13:12.125,I know it's been rough for you without your dad.
00:13:12.125,00:13:14.127,I know we don't talk much about them.
00:13:14.127,00:13:15.587,"Yeah, it's all right."
00:13:15.587,00:13:17.631,"No, it is not all right."
00:13:18.923,00:13:21.760,"I wish I could change it, but I can't."
00:13:23.344,00:13:25.054,Curt Connors.
00:13:25.054,00:13:27.848,That's the name of the guy in the picture.
00:13:27.848,00:13:30.935,"They worked together for years, and they were close."
00:13:30.935,00:13:33.563,"But after that night, we never saw him again."
00:13:33.563,00:13:35.649,He never even called.
00:13:35.649,00:13:37.275,Not once.
00:13:39.235,00:13:41.362,Go figure.
00:13:44.031,00:13:45.784,She's pretty.
00:13:50.664,00:13:52.206,Uncle Ben.
00:13:52.206,00:13:54.125,What?
00:13:54.125,00:13:56.503,"You're a pretty great dad, all right?"
00:14:51.391,00:14:53.976,Excuse me.
00:14:53.976,00:14:55.562,Can I help you?
00:14:55.562,00:14:58.398,I don't know.
00:14:58.398,00:15:01.025,Right. You'll find yourself to the left.
00:15:02.151,00:15:04.904,You are here for the internship?
00:15:04.904,00:15:07.156,Yeah. Yeah.
00:15:07.156,00:15:10.493,Okay. You'll find your badge to the left.
00:15:10.493,00:15:12.412,Oh.
00:15:15.790,00:15:18.042,Are you having trouble finding yourself?
00:15:18.042,00:15:20.503,"No. Yeah, I got it."
00:15:20.503,00:15:24.257,"Okay, Mr. Guevara."
00:15:24.257,00:15:26.551,Gracias.

00:15:44.235,00:15:46.905,Welcome to Oscorp.
00:15:46.905,00:15:50.032,"I'm a senior at Midtown Science, and I'm also head intern."
00:15:50.032,00:15:52.410,I'll be with you for the duration of your visit.
00:15:52.410,00:15:55.288,"Where I go, you go."
00:15:55.288,00:15:58.374,"Remember that, all will be fine."
00:15:58.374,00:16:00.376,And if you forget that-- BOY: Listen.
00:16:00.376,00:16:02.128,Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.
00:16:02.128,00:16:04.672,"Please, just tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here!"
00:16:04.672,00:16:05.924,My name's Rodrigo!
00:16:05.924,00:16:10.553,I guess I don't need to tell you what happens if you forget that.
00:16:18.311,00:16:20.354,Come around this way.
00:16:23.357,00:16:26.653,"Good afternoon, Gwen."
00:16:26.653,00:16:31.532,Welcome. My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.
00:16:31.532,00:16:33.910,"In case you're wondering, I'm a southpaw."
00:16:33.910,00:16:38.873,"I'm not a cripple, I'm a scientist, and I'm the world's foremost authority on herpetology."
00:16:38.873,00:16:41.709,"That's reptiles, for those of you who don't know."
00:16:41.709,00:16:53.930,"But like the Parkinson's patient who watches on in horror as her body slowly betrays her, or the man with macular degeneration whose eyes grow dimmer each day, I long to fix myself."
00:16:53.930,00:16:57.934,I want to create a world without weakness.
00:16:57.934,00:17:01.270,Anyone care to venture a guess just how?
00:17:01.270,00:17:03.564,Yes.
00:17:03.564,00:17:05.191,Promising.
00:17:05.191,00:17:08.277,But the solution I'm thinking of is more radical.
00:17:10.029,00:17:13.282,No one?
00:17:19.372,00:17:26.253,PETER: Person gets Parkinson's when the brain cells that produce dopamine start to disappear.
00:17:26.253,00:17:30.508,But a zebra fish has the ability to regenerate cells on command.
00:17:30.508,00:17:36.180,"If you could somehow give this ability to the woman you're talking about, that's that. She's..."
00:17:36.180,00:17:37.807,She's curing herself.
00:17:37.807,00:17:40.768,BOY: Just look past the gills on her neck.
00:17:43.145,00:17:45.773,Heh. A-And you are...?
00:17:47.358,00:17:51.487,He's one of Midtown Science's best and brightest.
00:17:51.487,00:17:53.614,He's second in his class.
00:17:53.614,00:17:55.533,Second?
00:17:55.533,00:17:58.285,You sure about that?
00:18:00.120,00:18:02.916,I'm afraid duty calls.
00:18:00.120,00:18:05.793,I'll leave you in the more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.
00:18:05.793,00:18:07.879,Nice meeting you all.
00:18:10.339,00:18:12.091,If you'd like to gather round.

00:18:25.980,00:18:29.817,"What are you doing, Rodrigo?"
00:18:29.817,00:18:31.652,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:31.652,00:18:33.153,What are you doing here?
00:18:33.153,00:18:36.074,I work here. I don't.
00:18:33.153,00:18:39.577,"I was gonna say I work here, but it seems like you, in fact, do, so you know that I don't."
00:18:39.577,00:18:42.455,Are you following me?
00:18:42.455,00:18:43.873,I had no idea you worked here.
00:18:43.873,00:18:45.332,Then why would you be here?
00:18:45.332,00:18:48.544,I just snuck in because I love science.
00:18:48.544,00:18:50.838,You love science.
00:18:50.838,00:18:52.632,So you snuck in...?
00:18:52.632,00:18:54.592,I have to lead this tour group.
00:18:54.592,00:18:56.636,So I'll ask you more about this later.
00:18:56.636,00:18:58.096,Do not get me in trouble.
00:18:58.096,00:19:00.640,I promise you I won't.
00:19:00.640,00:19:02.182,"All right, guys?"
00:19:02.182,00:19:04.602,I'm gonna take you to the bioreactor room now.
00:19:08.230,00:19:09.941,Sorry. Yo.
00:19:11.233,00:19:13.402,Sorry.
00:21:35.169,00:21:39.506,We received the results from the mRNA sequences this morning.
00:21:39.506,00:21:42.635,They were disappointing.
00:21:47.598,00:21:49.349,So define disappointing.
00:21:49.349,00:21:50.768,Another dead end.
00:21:50.768,00:21:52.728,It's the decay rate algorithm.
00:21:52.728,00:21:54.313,And this is to be expected.
00:21:54.313,00:21:56.857,Expected?
00:21:56.857,00:21:59.193,"We are close, but it's gonna take time."
00:21:59.193,00:22:00.486,He doesn't have time.
00:22:00.486,00:22:03.030,"Norman Osborn is dying, Dr. Connors."
00:22:03.030,00:22:04.782,Save him.
00:22:06.700,00:22:08.619,Or we'll both lose our heads.
00:22:27.221,00:22:28.889,"All right, give me the badge."
00:22:30.850,00:22:32.392,Give it to me.
00:22:34.937,00:22:37.481,Sorry.
00:23:37.958,00:23:41.295,Disgusting.
00:23:41.295,00:23:43.421,"Uh, sorry, I didn't mean to do that."
00:23:43.421,00:23:44.965,I didn't mean to...
00:23:44.965,00:23:49.469,I didn't-- I didn't-- Get your hand off her!
00:23:49.469,00:23:55.809,I'm trying to get my-- Are you kidding?
00:23:55.809,00:23:58.229,I'm sorry.
00:23:58.229,00:24:00.106,"MAN 1: Hey, get him, Rudy!"
00:24:00.106,00:24:01.481,Hey!
00:24:03.650,00:24:06.279,"Man, I'm sorry!"
00:24:08.906,00:24:10.741,WOMAN: Take him down! Come on.
00:24:13.286,00:24:15.413,"MAN 2: Get him, man!"
00:24:17.248,00:24:18.832,"No, man, no."
00:24:18.832,00:24:23.461,"Please, dude, don't-- PETER: Sorry!"
00:24:25.965,00:24:28.426,Sorry. Sorry. Oh.
00:24:28.426,00:24:30.010,I'm so sorry.
00:24:33.680,00:24:36.267,"Coney Island, next stop."
00:24:36.267,00:24:38.518,"Next and final stop, Coney Island."
00:24:48.821,00:24:51.198,"PETER: Uh, hey."
00:24:51.198,00:24:53.784,Hey. Hey.
00:24:53.784,00:24:55.119,Sorry. I'm late.
00:24:55.119,00:24:56.996,I got-- We've been so worried.
00:24:56.996,00:24:59.873,I know. I'm sorry. Watch out!
00:25:06.588,00:25:08.632,"That's a fly, Peter."
00:25:12.011,00:25:14.096,Yeah.
00:25:18.476,00:25:21.519,I'm so sorry I kept you guys up.
00:25:21.519,00:25:25.358,"I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible, and I'm hungry."
00:25:35.451,00:25:36.743,Drinking?
00:25:36.743,00:25:38.162,PETER: What's this?
00:25:38.162,00:25:39.537,I don't think so.
00:25:39.537,00:25:42.082,This is your meat loaf.
00:25:43.541,00:25:45.836,This beats all other meat loafs.
00:25:45.836,00:25:49.256,Something is very wrong.
00:25:49.256,00:25:50.548,Yeah.
00:25:50.548,00:25:53.635,Nobody likes your meat loaf.
00:25:58.807,00:26:00.851,I got it.
00:26:02.936,00:26:06.524,He took the frozen macaroni and cheese.
00:26:06.524,00:26:08.317,I noticed that.
00:26:08.317,00:26:11.070,Why didn't you tell me you didn't like my meat loaf?
00:26:11.070,00:26:12.612,Um...
00:26:12.612,00:26:14.781,You could have said that to me 37 years ago.
00:26:14.781,00:26:17.451,How many meat loaves have I made for you?
00:29:07.787,00:29:10.207,Peter.
00:29:10.207,00:29:11.791,What are you doing up there?
00:29:11.791,00:29:14.044,"I'm, uh..."
00:29:14.044,00:29:15.588,Homework.
00:29:15.588,00:29:17.256,Be careful.
00:29:17.256,00:29:20.092,Sure.
00:29:27.558,00:29:29.685,Dr. Connors.
00:29:29.685,00:29:31.437,Uh...
00:29:31.437,00:29:32.979,You don't remember me.
00:29:32.979,00:29:34.648,The intern from the other day.
00:29:34.648,00:29:36.734,"Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah."
00:29:36.734,00:29:39.194,"I'm sure you're a nice man, but this is a home."
00:29:39.194,00:29:41.614,Make an appointment with my office.
00:29:41.614,00:29:43.365,I'm Richard Parker's son.
00:29:48.912,00:29:51.831,Peter?
00:29:54.585,00:29:56.587,"I'm afraid I can't help you much, Peter."
00:29:56.587,00:29:59.339,I don't know why they left or where they were going.
00:30:02.175,00:30:03.552,Good reflexes.
00:30:03.552,00:30:05.638,Thank you.
00:30:09.891,00:30:12.018,Thank you.
00:30:12.018,00:30:13.771,Oh.
00:30:13.771,00:30:15.272,"It's something, you know."
00:30:15.272,00:30:20.152,"So you really think it's possible, cross-species genetics?"
00:30:20.152,00:30:22.862,But your father and I were mocked for our theories.
00:30:22.862,00:30:25.574,"Not just in the community, but at Oscorp, as well."
00:30:25.574,00:30:27.993,They called us mad scientists.
00:30:27.993,00:30:32.706,"And then your father bred the spiders, and everything changed."
00:30:32.706,00:30:34.708,The results were beyond encouraging.
00:30:34.708,00:30:36.752,They were spectacular.
00:30:38.754,00:30:41.923,We were gonna change the lives of millions.
00:30:41.923,00:30:44.343,Including my own.
00:30:44.343,00:30:46.428,Then it was over.
00:30:46.428,00:30:50.390,He... He was gone.
00:30:50.390,00:30:53.852,Took his research with him.
00:30:53.852,00:30:56.480,"And I knew without him, I..."
00:31:04.029,00:31:07.199,I...
00:31:07.199,00:31:10.452,I was angry.
00:31:10.452,00:31:15.874,So I stayed away from you and your family.
00:31:15.874,00:31:17.835,"And for that, I'm truly sorry."
00:31:26.134,00:31:28.387,Say...
00:31:28.387,00:31:29.638,Say it worked.
00:31:29.638,00:31:32.265,Say y-you got it to work.
00:31:32.265,00:31:36.395,"Like, how much would the foreign species take over?"
00:31:36.395,00:31:39.481,What could the side effects be?
00:31:42.984,00:31:46.279,"It's hard to say, considering no subject survived."
00:31:46.279,00:31:49.658,The problem was always-- The decay rate algorithm?
00:31:51.535,00:31:54.079,Right.
00:31:54.079,00:31:56.623,"Can I, uh...?"
00:31:56.623,00:31:58.667,Of course.
00:32:20.146,00:32:22.816,Extraordinary.
00:32:22.816,00:32:25.485,How did you come up with this?
00:32:31.324,00:32:36.204,"Peter, how would you feel about coming to the Tower, one day after school?"
00:32:38.081,00:32:40.125,Thank you.
00:32:59.895,00:33:01.730,BOY 1: Number one.
00:33:01.730,00:33:04.608,"Run it, buddy."
00:33:07.068,00:33:08.654,Rejected!
00:33:10.739,00:33:13.241,"You did that on purpose, Flash!"
00:33:13.241,00:33:15.452,"No, but I should have."
00:33:19.122,00:33:21.541,Hey.
00:33:22.793,00:33:24.252,All right?
00:33:30.425,00:33:31.927,"Give it up, Parker."
00:33:36.264,00:33:37.975,"PLAYER: Come on, man."
00:33:37.975,00:33:40.936,Oh. One sec.
00:33:43.981,00:33:46.024,"Come on, man."
00:33:43.981,00:33:47.985,Why don't you take it from me.
00:33:49.695,00:33:52.155,"PLAYER: That's right, Flash."
00:33:52.155,00:33:54.533,Go ahead. Take it.
00:34:14.011,00:34:15.679,Just take it.
00:34:17.890,00:34:22.185,"All right, how about this."
00:34:22.185,00:34:23.896,How about that?
00:34:26.982,00:34:29.484,PLAYER 1: Do something.
00:34:29.484,00:34:31.820,PLAYER 3: Take it from him!
00:34:31.820,00:34:33.238,"PLAYER 1: Flash, let's go."
00:34:33.238,00:34:34.990,PLAYER 2: Let's go!
00:34:34.990,00:34:36.950,Stop playing.
00:34:40.412,00:34:42.205,"What you doing, man?"
00:34:43.582,00:34:46.501,"All right, bring it! Come on, Parker! Come on!"
00:34:59.765,00:35:02.350,Peter's behavior is just completely unacceptable.
00:35:02.350,00:35:04.978,They're not gonna make us pay for the backboard.
00:35:04.978,00:35:06.688,I don't care about the backboard.
00:35:06.688,00:35:08.147,Was that true?
00:35:08.147,00:35:10.525,What I heard in there just now.
00:35:10.525,00:35:13.570,Did you humiliate that boy?
00:35:13.570,00:35:16.907,"Yeah, I did. But..."
00:35:16.907,00:35:19.034,But what?
00:35:19.034,00:35:20.285,Did he?
00:35:20.285,00:35:22.913,Is he the kid that hit you?
00:35:22.913,00:35:24.957,Is he?
00:35:24.957,00:35:26.165,"Yeah, yeah, but..."
00:35:26.165,00:35:29.127,So all this is about getting even.
00:35:29.127,00:35:33.172,"If so, I guess you must feel pretty good about yourself now, right?"
00:35:33.172,00:35:34.382,Am I right or wrong?
00:35:36.384,00:35:38.553,"Yeah, I thought so."
00:35:38.553,00:35:45.102,"Thanks to this little escapade of yours, I had to change shifts at work, so you have to pick up Aunt May tonight at 9:00."
00:35:45.102,00:35:46.979,Understood?
00:35:46.979,00:35:48.814,Is that understood?
00:35:48.814,00:35:51.733,"Okay, good."
00:35:51.733,00:35:54.152,She looks familiar.
00:35:55.528,00:35:58.156,"She's the girl on your computer, yeah."
00:35:58.156,00:36:00.951,He's got you on his computer.
00:36:00.951,00:36:03.120,I'm his probation officer.
00:36:03.120,00:36:05.204,Don't forget Aunt May.
00:36:08.917,00:36:10.919,Okay.
00:36:13.463,00:36:17.717,He's a character.
00:36:17.717,00:36:21.554,"He's a pathological liar, thought you were someone else."
00:36:21.554,00:36:24.223,"Oh, man, you don't have me on your computer?"
00:36:24.223,00:36:27.477,I took a photo of the debate team and you're in the team.
00:36:27.477,00:36:29.270,Right.
00:36:27.477,00:36:31.898,"So he must have seen-- Um, I-- Because I was touching up stuff."
00:36:31.898,00:36:34.192,You were touching up stuff?
00:36:34.192,00:36:37.112,"I was, I was... I'm not going to answer that."
00:36:39.114,00:36:40.406,Did you get expelled?
00:36:40.406,00:36:42.325,"No, no, I didn't get expelled."
00:36:42.325,00:36:44.077,I got community service.
00:36:46.746,00:36:50.083,"Um, so, uh, you want to, uh, I don't know...?"
00:36:50.083,00:36:51.543,Um...
00:36:51.543,00:36:54.462,Want to what?
00:36:54.462,00:36:57.632,"Just, uh..."
00:36:57.632,00:37:01.178,Um...
00:37:01.178,00:37:04.723,"I don't know, we could-- I don't know, we could, uh..."
00:37:04.723,00:37:06.975,"Or we could do something else, or we could..."
00:37:06.975,00:37:09.394,If you don't feel like-- Yeah.
00:37:09.394,00:37:11.437,Yeah?
00:37:11.437,00:37:13.314,Really?
00:37:13.314,00:37:15.525,Sure.
00:37:15.525,00:37:17.861,"Okay. All right, good."
00:37:17.861,00:37:19.278,Cool.
00:37:19.278,00:37:21.156,Okay.
00:37:21.156,00:37:23.575,I can't right now.
00:37:23.575,00:37:25.535,I'm so busy right now.
00:37:25.535,00:37:28.080,Ugh. Heh-heh.
00:37:28.080,00:37:31.083,"But, uh, maybe, uh..."
00:37:31.083,00:37:33.418,"Yeah, just, you know..."
00:37:33.418,00:37:35.253,"Time, all right."
00:37:35.253,00:37:37.172,Bye.
00:38:45.031,00:38:47.951,Whoa! Whoo!
00:39:03.424,00:39:10.098,"CONNORS: We have protein structure, rDNA, chromatography, transgenics testing, that's X-ray video."
00:39:10.098,00:39:11.975,That's the only one on the planet.
00:39:11.975,00:39:16.562,"We have, um, human line testing over-- I remember that."
00:39:16.562,00:39:19.732,I've seen that before.
00:39:19.732,00:39:22.735,PETER: I remember a picture of that in my dad's office.
00:39:22.735,00:39:25.030,The idea was simple.
00:39:25.030,00:39:29.075,"It creates a cloud, which can be dispersed over a neighborhood, an entire city."
00:39:29.075,00:39:32.537,"Theoretically, you could cure polio in an afternoon."
00:39:32.537,00:39:35.748,PETER: Incredible.

00:58:49.318,00:58:50.652,"Yes, I do."
00:58:50.652,00:58:52.154,Okay.
00:58:52.154,00:58:56.867,I was out.
00:58:56.867,00:59:00.037,Nope. Forgot the eggs.
00:59:00.037,00:59:04.041,You most certainly will not.
00:59:05.542,00:59:07.544,"Look at me, Peter."
00:59:09.129,00:59:12.049,Take off the damn hood and look at me.
00:59:19.306,00:59:21.016,Peter.
00:59:21.016,00:59:22.809,Where do you go?
00:59:22.809,00:59:24.478,Who does this to you?
00:59:24.478,00:59:26.355,"Please go to sleep, Aunt May."
00:59:26.355,00:59:28.606,Please tell me.
00:59:26.355,00:59:30.692,"Aunt May, please, please, please go to sleep."
00:59:30.692,00:59:32.069,I can't sleep.
00:59:32.069,00:59:33.987,Don't you understand?
00:59:45.374,00:59:48.001,"Peter, listen to me."
00:59:48.001,00:59:49.920,Secrets have a cost.
00:59:49.920,00:59:51.629,They're not for free.
00:59:51.629,00:59:54.049,"Not now, not ever."
01:00:00.514,01:00:03.641,CONNORS: Cross-species genetics is finally working.
01:00:03.641,01:00:07.145,I've used the lizard DNA to help Freddy regrow that limb.
01:00:07.145,01:00:08.855,RATHA: It's a miracle.
01:00:08.855,01:00:12.443,"No, it's hard work and promise and a step closer to the primate lab."
01:00:12.443,01:00:14.736,But he doesn't have time for every little step.
01:00:14.736,01:00:17.614,Little?
01:00:17.614,01:00:19.408,"Well, he'll have to."
01:00:19.408,01:00:21.452,Unless he wants to be a lab rat.
01:00:21.452,01:00:23.328,That's not what I'm saying.
01:00:23.328,01:00:24.788,CONNORS: What are you saying?
01:00:24.788,01:00:27.832,You have to start human trials.
01:00:27.832,01:00:29.209,Now.
01:00:29.209,01:00:31.587,"No, I don't, and no, I won't."
01:00:31.587,01:00:35.006,Then he's going to die.
01:00:35.006,01:00:36.967,Even Norman Osborn.
01:00:36.967,01:00:39.803,We are not finished.
01:00:39.803,01:00:42.514,Where are you going to find the people to volunteer?
01:00:42.514,01:00:45.309,"As far as anyone's concerned, it's for a winter flu shot."
01:00:45.309,01:00:48.479,The Veterans Hospital is a place to start.
01:00:48.479,01:00:49.938,You've got to be kidding me.
01:00:49.938,01:00:52.149,I don't think I am.
01:00:57.821,01:01:00.824,"It's a little late for shock and indignation, Curt."
01:01:00.824,01:01:02.200,About 15 years late.
01:01:02.200,01:01:04.202,I have no idea what you're talking about.
01:01:04.202,01:01:05.912,Richard Parker wore it well.
01:01:05.912,01:01:08.957,"On you, it's a cheap suit, as it was then."
01:01:08.957,01:01:10.417,I had nothing to do with that.
01:01:10.417,01:01:12.919,Is that what you told his son Peter?
01:01:16.965,01:01:19.134,I don't know what you're saying.
01:01:19.134,01:01:21.970,"You don't know, or you don't want to know?"
01:01:23.847,01:01:25.307,I'll remind you what happened.
01:01:25.307,01:01:29.436,Richard Parker said about the same thing then that you are saying now.
01:01:31.688,01:01:34.941,"The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors."
01:01:35.984,01:01:38.278,"I, um..."
01:01:45.076,01:01:47.204,I won't.
01:01:49.080,01:01:51.166,Fine.
01:01:54.794,01:01:58.131,The formula is ours now anyway.
01:01:58.131,01:02:02.052,Say good-bye to that arm you have dreamed of.
01:02:02.052,01:02:03.761,I'm shutting you down.
01:02:03.761,01:02:06.848,Have your office cleared out by the morning.
01:02:06.848,01:02:10.519,"Your toys can be taken away, too, you know."
01:02:12.437,01:02:14.398,"Right, Freddy?"
01:02:28.453,01:02:29.871,Hey.
01:02:29.871,01:02:32.249,How's it going?
01:02:32.249,01:02:35.293,"Uh, Monday, B track."
01:02:35.293,01:02:37.921,It's Thursday?
01:02:37.921,01:02:39.423,What?
01:02:39.423,01:02:41.258,"Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I don't..."
01:02:41.258,01:02:42.718,Maybe I got a rash or...
01:02:42.718,01:02:44.969,It's pretty bad.
01:02:44.969,01:02:47.055,Mm-hmm.
01:02:47.055,01:02:48.973,Do you like branzino?
01:02:48.973,01:02:50.850,"Like, a fish."
01:02:50.850,01:02:53.353,"Mm-hmm. No, no."
01:02:53.353,01:03:00.818,"Well, if you want, you can come to this address at, uh, 8:00 tonight."
01:03:00.818,01:03:02.904,My mom's making branzino.
01:03:02.904,01:03:04.197,So...
01:03:04.197,01:03:06.700,"Oh, it's apartment 2016."
01:03:06.700,01:03:09.661,I didn't write that part down.
01:03:09.661,01:03:11.329,I'll remember it.
01:03:11.329,01:03:14.374,2016.
01:04:21.232,01:04:23.985,Hi. Heh-heh.
01:04:23.985,01:04:25.362,How did you get out there?
01:04:25.362,01:04:27.905,"Uh, the fire escape."
01:04:27.905,01:04:30.534,Your doorman's intimidating.
01:04:30.534,01:04:32.410,It's 20 stories.
01:04:32.410,01:04:34.621,Yeah. It's all right.
01:04:37.874,01:04:39.417,This is your room.
01:04:39.417,01:04:40.960,"Yes, this is my room."
01:04:40.960,01:04:42.713,Books.
01:04:42.713,01:04:44.422,Shoes.
01:04:44.422,01:04:47.425,"Oh, hey, uh..."
01:04:47.425,01:04:50.178,"I got your mom, uh, these."
01:04:50.178,01:04:51.805,"Oh, lovely."
01:04:51.805,01:04:53.557,"Beautiful, right?"
01:04:53.557,01:04:55.058,They were...
01:04:55.058,01:04:57.143,"No, they're beautiful."
01:04:57.143,01:05:00.146,"No, it's impressive."
01:05:00.146,01:05:01.732,I'm going to keep these.
01:05:01.732,01:05:04.025,You have your suit in there?
01:05:06.027,01:05:08.154,My suit?
01:05:08.154,01:05:09.865,It's for dinner.
01:05:09.865,01:05:12.409,Are you going to wear that?
01:05:12.409,01:05:14.828,"That's, um..."
01:05:18.373,01:05:20.208,You must be Peter.
01:05:20.208,01:05:22.252,"Dad, this is Peter."
01:05:24.671,01:05:26.089,"Hey. Nice to meet you, sir."
01:05:26.089,01:05:28.425,Nice to meet you.
01:05:28.425,01:05:30.176,Dinner's ready.
01:05:30.176,01:05:32.303,Hope you like branzino.
01:05:32.303,01:05:33.930,Who doesn't?
01:06:31.070,01:06:33.197,Aah!
01:06:33.197,01:06:34.699,"CONNORS: Emma, it's Curt."
01:06:34.699,01:06:37.285,Is he there?
01:06:37.285,01:06:40.580,The car is taking him to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.
01:06:40.580,01:06:42.039,"No, no, no, no."
01:06:42.039,01:06:47.044,"You-- You-- You have to stop him. He-- EMMA: I would, but I lose him when he's on the bridge."
01:06:47.044,01:06:50.465,I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns your call soon.
01:07:00.183,01:07:03.645,"Holton Avenue, across the river."
01:07:03.645,01:07:05.814,Take the tunnel or the bridge?
01:07:05.814,01:07:07.273,Bridge! Take the bridge.
01:07:07.273,01:07:08.775,"All right, we'll do that."
01:07:08.775,01:07:10.944,"Hey, man, you all right back there?"
01:07:10.944,01:07:12.654,Are you tweaking?
01:07:14.990,01:07:16.783,Just drive.
01:07:16.783,01:07:18.618,Okay.
01:07:24.666,01:07:28.211,You're having trouble there?
01:07:24.666,01:07:29.796,"The head goes on the other-- Simon, help Gwen's friend."
01:07:29.796,01:07:31.255,"PETER: Oh, I..."
01:07:31.255,01:07:32.757,I got no idea.
01:07:32.757,01:07:35.218,First time.
01:07:35.218,01:07:38.763,"George, tell us about your day."
01:07:38.763,01:07:40.598,"STACY: No, we didn't catch him yet."
01:07:40.598,01:07:42.684,But we will.
01:07:40.598,01:07:45.478,He's an amateur who's assaulting civilians in the dead of night.
01:07:45.478,01:07:49.106,"He's clumsy, he leaves clues, but he's still dangerous."
01:07:49.106,01:07:52.318,He's assault-- He's assaulting people?
01:07:52.318,01:07:55.947,I'm not sure.
01:07:52.318,01:08:03.496,"I mean, I saw that video with him and the car thief and I think most people would say that he was providing a public service."
01:08:03.496,01:08:06.165,Most people would be wrong.
01:08:06.165,01:08:10.962,"If I wanted the car thief off the street, he'd already be off the street."
01:08:10.962,01:08:13.381,"So, why wasn't he, then?"
01:08:16.175,01:08:18.803,Let me illuminate you.
01:08:16.175,01:08:21.389,The car thief was leading us to the people who run the entire operation.
01:08:21.389,01:08:23.975,It's a six-month-long sting.
01:08:23.975,01:08:27.228,You're aware of strategy. You've heard about that in school?
01:08:27.228,01:08:29.313,Yeah.
01:08:29.313,01:08:32.525,He didn't know you had a plan.
01:08:32.525,01:08:35.737,You seem to know an awful lot.
01:08:35.737,01:08:37.948,Whose side are you on?
01:08:37.948,01:08:39.532,I saw a video on the Internet...
01:08:39.532,01:08:41.826,Oh. You saw the video on the Internet.
01:08:41.826,01:08:44.287,The case is closed.
01:08:41.826,01:08:46.414,"No, I'm just saying if you watch the video-- Send you a link?"
01:08:46.414,01:08:48.207,It looks like he's trying to help.
01:08:48.207,01:08:51.628,"On the Internet, he's made look like some masked hero."
01:08:51.628,01:08:54.005,I don't think he's a hero.
01:08:54.005,01:08:56.424,What are you trying to say?
01:08:54.005,01:08:58.676,"He's trying to help, trying to do something the police can't."
01:08:58.676,01:09:00.011,Something the police can't?
01:09:00.011,01:09:01.972,I don't know.
01:09:01.972,01:09:04.849,Sit around eating doughnuts with our thumbs up our asses?
01:09:04.849,01:09:07.102,HELEN: George. George.
01:09:07.102,01:09:09.854,"Up your what, Dad?"
01:09:07.102,01:09:12.023,"He stands for what you do, protecting innocent people from bad guys."
01:09:12.023,01:09:14.692,I stand for law and order.
01:09:14.692,01:09:17.320,I wear a badge. This guy wears a mask like a...
01:09:17.320,01:09:18.947,"you know, like an outlaw."
01:09:18.947,01:09:24.119,"He's hunting down criminals that all look the same, like he's got some sort of personal vendetta."
01:09:24.119,01:09:27.204,"But he's not protecting innocent people, Mr. Parker."
01:09:27.204,01:09:29.499,"Let's get some air, Peter."
01:09:29.499,01:09:32.127,"Dad, we need to talk."
01:09:33.962,01:09:36.923,Thank you.
01:09:36.923,01:09:38.675,It was not my intention.
01:09:38.675,01:09:40.093,You're welcome.
01:09:40.093,01:09:42.095,"Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy."
01:09:42.095,01:09:44.472,Thank you.
01:09:46.057,01:09:48.768,SIMON: Dad.
01:09:55.025,01:09:57.777,"Well, that was something."
01:09:57.777,01:10:02.157,I'm sorry. I thought he was going to arrest me at one point.
01:10:02.157,01:10:05.409,"Nah, I wouldn't have let him arrest you."
01:10:08.830,01:10:10.123,What happened to your face?
01:10:10.123,01:10:11.958,I'm going to tell you something.
01:10:11.958,01:10:15.503,Oh. Heh-heh. Okay.
01:10:19.799,01:10:21.759,I've been bitten...
01:10:25.138,01:10:26.931,So have I.
01:10:31.602,01:10:34.271,Okay.
01:10:34.271,01:10:36.941,"Okay, okay, okay, I got to tell you this one thing."
01:10:36.941,01:10:39.610,"This one thing, and it's about the..."
01:10:39.610,01:10:41.320,the vigilante and the car thief.
01:10:41.320,01:10:44.490,"Oh, okay."
01:10:44.490,01:10:47.160,"No, no, no. Don't..."
01:10:47.160,01:10:49.913,"Okay, forget that. I'm going to talk about me, okay?"
01:10:49.913,01:10:52.707,What about you?
01:10:49.913,01:10:54.458,It's impo-- I--I wish I could just...
01:10:54.458,01:10:56.586,I can't. It's hard to say.
01:10:56.586,01:10:58.713,Just say it.
01:10:58.713,01:11:00.256,Say it.
01:11:02.008,01:11:04.301,What? What?
01:11:07.180,01:11:09.306,What?
01:11:12.977,01:11:15.479,"Okay, then, forget it."
01:11:22.987,01:11:24.948,You...?
01:11:33.164,01:11:35.666,You're Spider-Man.

01:14:30.049,01:14:31.884,Help me! My kid is trapped!
01:14:40.977,01:14:43.980,BOY: I want my dad! Dad!
01:14:43.980,01:14:45.481,Help!
01:14:45.481,01:14:47.817,"Hey, it's okay. It's all right."
01:14:47.817,01:14:50.027,Aah! Help!
01:14:51.321,01:14:53.448,"Just a normal guy, all right?"
01:14:54.949,01:14:57.201,You want to hold on to this?
01:14:57.201,01:15:00.079,Hold my mask.
01:15:01.372,01:15:02.957,What's your name?
01:15:02.957,01:15:05.001,Jack?
01:15:05.001,01:15:07.503,Let's get you out of here.
01:15:07.503,01:15:09.630,"Okay, stay very still."
01:15:09.630,01:15:12.508,All right.
01:15:15.052,01:15:18.097,"Okay, now, look."
01:15:18.097,01:15:20.433,Hold on to that seat in front of you.
01:15:20.433,01:15:24.354,On three? All right.
01:15:24.354,01:15:28.441,You see how easy that was?
01:15:28.441,01:15:30.443,"All right, okay."
01:15:43.831,01:15:45.208,"Jack, climb now."
01:15:45.208,01:15:47.335,I can't.
01:15:52.215,01:15:54.425,Put... put it on-- the mask.
01:15:54.425,01:15:56.010,It's going to make you strong.
01:15:56.010,01:15:59.055,"Jack, trust me. Put it on."
01:15:59.055,01:16:02.392,There you go. That's it.
01:16:02.392,01:16:05.019,"Okay, now, climb."
01:16:08.105,01:16:10.983,Do me a favor.
01:16:10.983,01:16:13.652,"You're doing great, buddy."
01:16:13.652,01:16:16.489,That's it. Keep coming.
01:16:16.489,01:16:18.366,Keep coming.
01:16:18.366,01:16:20.701,No!
01:16:34.382,01:16:37.885,"Jack. Oh, God. Thank God."
01:16:39.470,01:16:40.846,You okay?
01:16:43.599,01:16:45.476,My son. My son.
01:16:45.476,01:16:49.439,"Oh, my son. My son."
01:16:53.276,01:16:54.902,Who are you?

01:17:45.911,01:17:48.247,Beautiful.

01:17:58.007,01:17:59.716,"Settle down, boys."
01:17:59.716,01:18:02.886,MAN: Come on.
01:17:59.716,01:18:05.640,"Listen. At approximately 9 p.m., an incident took place on the Williamsburg Bridge."
01:18:05.640,01:18:08.684,Much of what occurred is merely speculation at this point.
01:18:08.684,01:18:17.193,"However, eyewitnesses to the crime, as well as our own preliminary findings, have positively placed one individual at the scene."
01:18:17.193,01:18:24.450,"Which is why, this morning, I am issuing an arrest warrant for the masked vigilante known as Spider-Man."
01:18:29.955,01:18:36.003,REPORTER: Council members met with homeowners and officials in the first of four meetings...
01:18:42.259,01:18:44.637,It's so beautiful.
01:18:44.637,01:18:45.971,"Knows how to bite, though."
01:18:45.971,01:18:47.973,Who else knows about this?
01:18:47.973,01:18:49.600,Just you.
01:18:49.600,01:18:51.018,Really?
01:18:52.645,01:18:55.022,"Hey, you--you don't..."
01:18:55.022,01:18:58.693,"you don't believe what the police are saying, do you?"
01:18:58.693,01:19:01.153,Of course not.
01:19:02.572,01:19:06.950,Does it scare you?
01:19:08.118,01:19:10.037,No.
01:19:10.996,01:19:12.498,No.
01:19:12.498,01:19:15.626,What did that thing on the bridge look like?
01:19:15.626,01:19:18.629,It was real big.
01:19:18.629,01:19:21.090,You got to lay low.
01:19:21.090,01:19:22.966,"No, can't do that."
01:19:22.966,01:19:24.635,You've got to.
01:19:24.635,01:19:26.637,"I mean, why...?"
01:19:26.637,01:19:29.265,Because of last night.
01:19:29.265,01:19:31.392,Those people on the bridge.
01:19:31.392,01:19:34.186,Whatever was attacking them would have...
01:19:34.186,01:19:35.938,would have killed them.
01:19:37.189,01:19:40.150,So I got to go after it.
01:19:41.235,01:19:42.653,That's not your job.
01:19:44.113,01:19:46.282,Maybe it is.
01:19:50.119,01:19:52.455,I really liked kissing you.
01:19:54.290,01:19:56.542,You're an amazing kisser.
01:19:58.628,01:20:02.923,"Well, you know, it was..."
01:20:04.592,01:20:06.969,Yeah?
01:20:14.435,01:20:17.229,Yo!
01:20:38.208,01:20:40.002,Hello!
01:20:49.178,01:20:51.472,CONNORS: It's not nice to snoop.
01:20:54.266,01:20:56.644,I gave everyone the week off.
01:20:58.061,01:20:59.563,Yeah.
01:20:59.563,01:21:02.149,Shouldn't you be at school?
01:21:03.484,01:21:05.653,"No, I got a-- I got a free track."
01:21:05.653,01:21:08.364,I want-- I wanted to ask you a question.
01:21:08.364,01:21:11.200,How would a predator track a reptile?
01:21:11.200,01:21:14.286,"Oh, they don't."
01:21:11.200,01:21:17.289,"Most reptiles are at the top of their respective food chain, kings of their domain."
01:21:17.289,01:21:18.999,They got to have vulnerabilities.
01:21:18.999,01:21:21.752,Why the sudden interest in the cold-blooded?
01:21:24.380,01:21:26.215,Just asking a question.
01:21:26.215,01:21:29.593,I got-- I got school stuff.
01:21:29.593,01:21:31.679,Biology profiles to do.
01:21:31.679,01:21:34.348,Oh.
01:21:31.679,01:21:37.100,"So, because of the cold blood, would they react to changes in temperatures?"
01:21:37.100,01:21:40.312,You'd have to catch one first.
01:21:37.100,01:21:42.314,Did you know there's a rumor of a new species in New York?
01:21:42.314,01:21:43.858,Beautiful and quite large.
01:21:43.858,01:21:47.027,What do you know about it?
01:21:47.027,01:21:49.196,"No, it's not yet classified."
01:21:51.532,01:21:54.284,But it can be aggressive...
01:21:54.284,01:21:56.078,if threatened.
01:22:03.544,01:22:05.045,"Doc, you all right?"
01:22:05.045,01:22:07.798,"Never been better, Peter."
01:22:07.798,01:22:11.343,"If you'll excuse me, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
01:22:11.343,01:22:15.598,I have a new project.
01:22:15.598,01:22:18.434,"Good. Good, good."
01:22:18.434,01:22:20.394,Good.
01:22:20.394,01:22:24.690,"Don't worry, Mr. Parker."
01:22:24.690,01:22:27.693,Wonderful things are coming.
01:22:27.693,01:22:29.986,Wonderful things.
01:22:44.126,01:22:46.295,Fred?
01:22:50.382,01:22:55.471,"Mr. Mayor, if there was a giant dinosaur running around, you would be the first to know."
01:22:55.471,01:22:58.348,"So tell your son he can rest easy, all right?"
01:22:58.348,01:23:00.434,Yeah.
01:23:00.434,01:23:02.770,Okay. Bye-bye.
01:23:02.770,01:23:06.106,"Mr. Parker, why are you not in school?"
01:23:06.106,01:23:08.317,Got a free track.
01:23:06.106,01:23:09.860,"Well, I do not, so make your point quickly."
01:23:09.860,01:23:14.740,"There may not be a dinosaur, but there is something more dangerous, and I know who it is."
01:23:14.740,01:23:17.033,You know who?
01:23:17.033,01:23:18.953,Of Oscorp?
01:23:18.953,01:23:21.497,"Dr. Connors, who's also my daughter's mentor."
01:23:21.497,01:23:23.206,Is that who?
01:23:23.206,01:23:26.669,Dr. Connors gave Gwen a glowing college recommendation.
01:23:26.669,01:23:28.879,It was beautiful.
01:23:28.879,01:23:33.509,But you would have me believe he is running around dressed up like a giant dinosaur?
01:23:33.509,01:23:35.260,"Not dressing up, not a dinosaur."
01:23:35.260,01:23:39.264,He has transformed into a giant lizard.
01:23:40.599,01:23:42.267,Let me ask you a question.
01:23:42.267,01:23:45.479,Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo to you?
01:23:45.479,01:23:48.106,I'm telling you the absolute truth.
01:23:48.106,01:23:51.318,This man has worked on cross-species genetics.
01:23:51.318,01:23:57.032,"He lost one arm, and he's trying to grow it back, but there was something imbalanced, and he has turned into a lizard."
01:23:57.032,01:23:59.159,He's using lizard DNA.
01:23:59.159,01:24:01.620,"He's planning something horrific, I know."
01:24:01.620,01:24:04.206,"Okay. All right, I get it."
01:24:04.206,01:24:07.001,Here's what we're going to do.
01:24:04.206,01:24:14.049,"You're going to go back to hanging out with the citizens of Tokyo, and I'm going to go back to protecting the citizens of this fine, fair city of ours."
01:24:14.049,01:24:19.513,"Sergeant Butler, please escort Mr. Parker back to school."
01:24:19.513,01:24:21.139,"Just bring him in, call him in."
01:24:21.139,01:24:24.434,You have to call him in.
01:24:24.434,01:24:28.564,"Just, please, listen to me."
01:24:31.274,01:24:33.736,Jimmy...
01:24:33.736,01:24:36.697,Get me everything we have on Dr. Curtis Connors.
01:24:36.697,01:24:39.199,Okay? Right away.

01:29:09.761,01:29:15.309,"Also, my father is under the impression you require psychiatric attention."
01:29:15.309,01:29:17.686,"Oh, really?"
01:29:17.686,01:29:20.772,What happened?
01:29:22.149,01:29:26.987,"The other guy, in this instance, being a giant mutant lizard."
01:29:26.987,01:29:29.239,"Hey, Gwen, honey, do you want cocoa?"
01:29:29.239,01:29:32.326,Howard's making some cocoa.
01:29:33.660,01:29:36.579,"No, Dad, I do not want cocoa."
01:29:36.579,01:29:38.081,"Honestly, I'm 17 years old."
01:29:38.081,01:29:43.628,Okay. I just remembered somebody saying last week her fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.
01:29:43.628,01:29:45.421,"Well, that's impractical."
01:29:45.421,01:29:46.923,And fattening.
01:29:49.634,01:29:51.261,Chocolate house.
01:29:53.680,01:29:55.765,"Sorry, Dad."
01:29:55.765,01:30:01.813,"I just... I can't, um, have cocoa right now, because I'm work-- I'm doing this, um..."
01:30:01.813,01:30:03.815,"I have, uh... I have cramps."
01:30:03.815,01:30:06.651,Oh.
01:30:06.651,01:30:09.154,just emotional. I keep crying.
01:30:09.154,01:30:12.532,It's brutal.
01:30:12.532,01:30:14.617,"Trust me, it's, like, bad."
01:30:14.617,01:30:17.246,"Thanks, Daddy."
01:30:42.062,01:30:44.898,"Easy, Bug Boy."
01:30:44.898,01:30:47.317,What'd you call me?
01:30:51.321,01:30:53.365,I'm going to be all right.
01:30:53.365,01:30:56.743,No. No.
01:30:56.743,01:30:59.537,I know what this is.
01:30:59.537,01:31:01.623,What is it?
01:31:01.623,01:31:13.009,"Every day, for as long as I can remember, my father has left every morning, and he's put a badge on his chest and strapped a gun to his hip."
01:31:15.137,01:31:20.683,"And every day, for as long as I can remember, I haven't known if he was going to make it home."
01:31:29.567,01:31:32.154,I got you.
01:31:32.154,01:31:33.989,Okay?
01:31:36.699,01:31:38.160,Okay?
01:31:39.369,01:31:42.122,"I got to stop him, though."
01:31:42.122,01:31:45.167,"I have to, 'cause I created him."
01:31:47.961,01:31:50.464,What do you mean?
01:31:50.464,01:31:55.051,I gave him an equation...
01:31:55.051,01:31:58.054,that made all of this possible.
01:32:05.020,01:32:07.814,"Something my father had been working on, you know."
01:32:07.814,01:32:12.777,Secretly. Now I realize why he kept it a secret.
01:32:14.446,01:32:17.032,"Point is, this is my responsibility."
01:32:19.909,01:32:22.745,I have to fix it.
