00:00:29.822,00:00:30.906,Wah!
00:00:30.948,00:00:33.868,Illumination! Illumination!
00:01:26.503,00:01:28.630,I've lived in this city all my life.
00:01:28.672,00:01:33.134,"I'm Max, and I'm the luckiest dog in New York..."
00:01:33.176,00:01:35.136,because of her.
00:01:35.178,00:01:36.847,That's Katie.
00:01:36.889,00:01:40.141,"Katie and I... well, we have the perfect relationship."
00:01:40.183,00:01:46.774,"We met a few years ago, and, boy, let me tell you, we got along right away."
00:01:46.815,00:01:48.358,"You know, it was one of those relationships where..."
00:01:48.400,00:01:50.318,where you just know.
00:01:51.779,00:01:56.283,"A-And get this, she was looking for a roommate, and so was I!"
00:01:56.324,00:01:59.327,So I just moved in that same day.
00:01:59.369,00:02:00.829,It was perfect.
00:02:01.288,00:02:03.916,We've been together ever since.
00:02:05.960,00:02:08.169,Katie would do anything for me.
00:02:08.211,00:02:10.338,And I'm her loyal protector.
00:02:15.427,00:02:17.178,Our love is...
00:02:17.220,00:02:21.433,our love is-- how do I put this?-- o-our love is stronger than words.
00:02:21.475,00:02:24.645,Or shoes.
00:02:24.686,00:02:27.397,It's me and Katie.
00:02:27.439,00:02:28.732,Katie and me.
00:02:32.235,00:02:34.195,Us against the world.
00:02:40.243,00:02:45.290,"I wouldn't go so far as to call us soul mates, even though any sane person who saw us would."
00:03:02.307,00:03:05.226,There's just...
00:03:05.268,00:03:07.270,Pretty much every day...
00:03:07.312,00:03:10.024,"-Come on, Max."
00:03:10.065,00:03:11.984,I'll see you tonight.
00:03:12.026,00:03:15.236,Sometimes I try stuff -to get her to stay.
00:03:15.278,00:03:16.655,Okay.
00:03:16.697,00:03:18.573,Sit.
00:03:18.615,00:03:20.408,Spin.
00:03:21.284,00:03:23.078,Speak.
00:03:23.120,00:03:25.246,Okay. That's a good boy!
00:03:25.288,00:03:28.042,But it never works.
00:03:28.083,00:03:29.960,Where is she going?!
00:03:31.628,00:03:34.715,What could she possibly be doing?
00:03:36.299,00:03:38.343,"Oh, I miss her so much."
00:03:40.095,00:03:42.890,"Wha... uh, oh, my... oh, she's back!"
00:03:42.931,00:03:45.100,Forgot my phone.
00:03:45.142,00:03:46.226,What took so long?
00:03:46.267,00:03:47.394,Why did you...
00:03:47.435,00:03:50.313,"Oh, come on!"
00:03:50.355,00:03:51.272,Oh.
00:03:51.314,00:03:54.151,I miss her so much.
00:03:54.193,00:03:56.153,"WOMAN: Bye, Gidget."
00:04:04.161,00:04:06.663,"-Hey, Max!"
00:04:06.705,00:04:08.207,Any plans today?
00:04:08.248,00:04:10.250,"Uh, yes."
00:04:10.291,00:04:12.252,I got big plans.
00:04:10.291,00:04:14.337,I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna wait for Katie to come back.
00:04:14.379,00:04:16.090,"Oh, that sounds exciting."
00:04:16.131,00:04:17.674,"Well, I won't interrupt."
00:04:17.716,00:04:20.677,"I've got a very busy day, too."
00:04:24.472,00:04:27.684,WOMAN: Here you go.
00:04:33.398,00:04:35.859,"MAN: Bye, Peppy."
00:04:45.786,00:04:47.788,"MAN: So long, Mel."
00:04:50.707,00:04:52.333,"MAN: Bye, Sweetpea."
00:04:53.376,00:04:55.503,"See ya, Gino."
00:04:55.545,00:04:56.964,"Bye, Mr. Wiggles."
00:04:57.089,00:04:58.339,"GIRL: I'll miss you, Shelly."
00:04:58.381,00:04:59.466,"MAN: Later, Runty."
00:04:59.507,00:05:00.592,"WOMAN: Bye, everyone."
00:05:00.634,00:05:01.301,WOMAN 2: Bye.
00:06:57.500,00:06:59.586,"MAN: You be a good boy, Leonard."
00:07:11.056,00:07:12.599,"Hey, Max."
00:07:12.640,00:07:16.311,"Hey, Chloe, do you ever wonder where they go during the day?"
00:07:16.353,00:07:17.478,Do you know what? I just...
00:07:17.520,00:07:19.480,I don't really care.
00:07:19.522,00:07:23.110,"Maybe that's what it's like for you, but Katie and I have a different relationship."
00:07:23.151,00:07:28.115,"You know, you're-you're a cat, so maybe that's why, 'cause nobody could ever love a cat the way they love a dog."
00:07:28.156,00:07:30.117,I'm just sayin'.
00:07:30.158,00:07:32.619,Whatever you need to tell yourself.
00:07:38.541,00:07:41.128,"Hey, morning, Max!"
00:07:41.169,00:07:43.504,"What's up, Sweetpea?"
00:07:43.546,00:07:45.882,"Hey, Mel, where you been, man?"
00:07:45.924,00:07:47.508,Oh! Get this!
00:07:47.550,00:07:50.470,"Last Sunday, my owner feeds me a small white pill, right?"
00:07:50.511,00:07:52.472,I start to feel a little groggy.
00:07:52.513,00:07:55.516,"The next thing I know, I wake up, I'm in the sky!"
00:07:55.558,00:07:56.559,Wait a minute.
00:07:56.601,00:07:58.228,"Yeah, there are suitcases everywhere."
00:07:58.270,00:08:00.563,I'm locked up in a crate.
00:08:00.605,00:08:01.940,There are suitcases in the sky?
00:08:01.982,00:08:05.652,"Yeah, so I pass out from fear, and when I wake up, I'm in Florida!"
00:08:05.693,00:08:07.570,"Um, this did not happen."
00:08:07.612,00:08:09.781,I will never eat a pill like that again.
00:08:09.823,00:08:11.532,Unless it's covered in peanut butter.
00:08:11.574,00:08:14.119,"Because, I mean, come on!"
00:08:15.912,00:08:18.539,"-Hey, guys!"
00:08:18.581,00:08:20.541,You still looking for your apartment?
00:08:20.583,00:08:22.419,Yeah. Going on three weeks now.
00:08:22.461,00:08:24.545,Is this the second or the third floor?
00:08:24.587,00:08:27.590,"I don't know any numbers, but, uh, you don't live here."
00:08:27.632,00:08:28.967,"Aw, pellets!"
00:08:29.009,00:08:31.970,"Well, see you guys later!"
00:08:32.012,00:08:33.805,You know what?
00:08:33.847,00:08:36.350,Can't do it.
00:08:36.391,00:08:38.559,Buddy! Th-There you are!
00:08:38.601,00:08:39.602,D-Did you find it?
00:08:43.064,00:08:45.025,Voil√°!
00:08:45.066,00:08:47.610,"-Ball! Ball, ball, ball!"
00:08:47.652,00:08:49.821,MAX: Katie's gonna be so excited!
00:08:49.863,00:08:51.698,Th-This is exactly like the one she lost!
00:08:51.739,00:08:53.158,"-I mean, look at it."
00:08:53.200,00:08:55.785,"It's round, it fits in my mouth."
00:08:55.827,00:08:56.786,DOGS: Ball!
00:08:56.828,00:08:58.330,Yeah! Hee-hee-hee!
00:08:59.622,00:09:00.874,Ooh.
00:09:07.630,00:09:11.592,There is no other ball in the city like this one ball.
00:09:11.634,00:09:13.845,"Guaranteed, this is the ball."
00:09:23.897,00:09:25.732,KATIE: Hey!
00:09:25.773,00:09:27.608,"I'm home, Max!"
00:09:27.650,00:09:29.403,"Hey, Maximilian!"
00:09:29.444,00:09:32.613,"How was your day, buddy?"
00:09:32.655,00:09:35.616,"Ah, yes, I'm so psyched to see you, too, buddy."
00:09:35.658,00:09:37.618,"Okay, boy, calm down."
00:09:37.660,00:09:39.620,It's okay. Let's all be calm.
00:09:39.662,00:09:42.332,"Now, I have some... big news."
00:09:44.418,00:09:47.546,"some getting used to, but..."
00:09:44.418,00:09:49.548,but I think it's gonna be a great thing in the long...
00:09:49.589,00:09:50.715,Oh!
00:09:50.757,00:09:53.468,"Max, this is Duke!"
00:09:55.178,00:09:58.639,He's going to be your...
00:10:00.100,00:10:01.642,"No, no, Max."
00:10:01.684,00:10:04.354,"It's gonna be all right, Duke."
00:10:04.396,00:10:06.773,It's okay.
00:10:12.987,00:10:16.283,"Aw, see? He likes you."
00:10:20.161,00:10:22.789,"Aw. Yeah, that's it, Duke."
00:10:22.830,00:10:24.749,Take a look around.
00:10:26.293,00:10:28.878,"I know, buddy."
00:10:28.920,00:10:31.131,But... he didn't have a home.
00:10:31.172,00:10:34.301,So you and I are gonna have to take care of him.
00:10:36.719,00:10:40.765,KATIE: Duke found our lost ball!
00:10:40.807,00:10:42.976,What a great team we're gonna be!
00:10:59.700,00:11:01.661,"Love you, Maxie."
00:11:03.746,00:11:05.873,"Love you, Duke."
00:11:11.754,00:11:14.132,"Sleep tight, boys. Mwah!"
00:11:16.759,00:11:18.261,Psst.
00:11:19.304,00:11:20.679,Psst.
00:11:21.764,00:11:23.724,Hey. Little guy.
00:11:23.766,00:11:26.227,This place is so great!
00:11:26.269,00:11:27.562,Uh-huh.
00:11:27.604,00:11:31.483,"By the way, that is..."
00:11:31.525,00:11:32.817,Yeah. It's okay.
00:11:32.859,00:11:34.235,Maybe we could share.
00:11:34.277,00:11:38.739,"You know, one night you get the bed, the next night I do, that kind of thing."
00:11:38.781,00:11:40.617,"You know, this bed is mine."
00:11:40.659,00:11:43.495,You? You get an old blanket.
00:11:43.537,00:11:45.746,You're an old blanket kind of a dog.
00:11:45.788,00:11:47.748,"Oh, wow."
00:11:47.790,00:11:49.376,You are stubborn!
00:11:49.417,00:11:50.502,"Hey, I-I get it."
00:11:50.544,00:11:52.504,"I'm stubborn, too."
00:11:50.544,00:11:54.214,But we got to learn -to get along.
00:11:54.255,00:11:56.757,I'll bet we can both fit in this bed if we really try.
00:11:56.799,00:11:58.717,"-No, no. No, wait."
00:11:58.759,00:12:01.804,"Ah. Perfect. This is comfy, right?"
00:12:01.846,00:12:03.806,"No, it is not!"
00:12:03.848,00:12:05.308,MAX: Aah!
00:12:05.350,00:12:06.601,I'm comfy.
00:12:08.562,00:12:10.647,Duke is just ruining our lives!
00:12:10.689,00:12:13.858,It's an emergency that you get rid of this dog!
00:12:13.900,00:12:14.526,He stole my...
00:12:17.445,00:12:21.199,...and he's scary and he's frightening and he's the death of all good things.
00:12:21.241,00:12:23.284,"KATIE: Aw, you little cutie pie!"
00:12:23.326,00:12:25.537,"We'll play tomorrow, buddy, okay?"
00:12:25.579,00:12:27.664,"Okay, sleep well."
00:12:27.706,00:12:30.791,to get rid of me?
00:12:30.833,00:12:35.046,"Before I answer that, I-I'd like to know how much you heard."
00:12:35.088,00:12:36.923,"So that's how it's gonna be, huh?"
00:12:36.964,00:12:39.175,"Oh, man, are you making me angry!"
00:12:39.217,00:12:42.345,"And when I get angry, I do this!"
00:12:43.888,00:12:45.515,And I don't want to do that!
00:12:45.557,00:12:51.521,"I need this place, and if it's gonna come down to you or me, it's gonna be me!"
00:12:52.564,00:12:54.190,Aah!
00:13:44.699,00:13:45.659,"Morning, Max!"
00:13:45.700,00:13:48.161,Max! Max!
00:13:48.202,00:13:50.789,It's me! Hi! Hi!
00:13:50.829,00:13:52.582,Chloe!
00:13:52.624,00:13:54.584,"Chloe, Chloe, I got a bad situation."
00:13:55.876,00:13:58.672,Katie brought home a new dog from the pound!
00:13:58.713,00:14:00.881,She said he's my brother.
00:14:00.923,00:14:03.426,And I don't...
00:14:03.468,00:14:05.886,"I'm sleeping on the floor, like a dog."
00:14:05.928,00:14:07.555,Why would Katie do this to me?
00:14:07.597,00:14:14.895,"Because she's a dog person, Max, and dog people do weird, inexplicable things, like..."
00:14:14.937,00:14:16.439,they get dogs instead of cats.
00:14:16.481,00:14:18.692,"Okay, please don't start now, Chloe."
00:14:18.733,00:14:19.900,That is not helping.
00:14:19.942,00:14:22.278,"Max, come on, I'm your friend."
00:14:22.320,00:14:26.658,"Okay? And as your friend, I got to be honest with you, I don't care about you or your problems."
00:14:26.700,00:14:36.376,"But if you don't do something about this guy, and soon, your perfect little life with your dumb, bleh human is gonna be over... forever."
00:14:36.417,00:14:37.836,-Forever?
00:14:37.877,00:14:39.879,"Yeah, that's what I just..."
00:14:39.920,00:14:42.923,Why is this mouse on my paw still?!
00:14:44.217,00:14:49.096,"Look, if you really want to get your turf back, you're gonna have to start acting like the alpha dog."
00:14:49.138,00:14:50.765,Right. Alpha dog.
00:14:50.807,00:14:52.933,I-I can do that.
00:14:52.975,00:14:54.644,"KATIE: Okay, okay, okay."
00:14:54.686,00:14:56.229,"I mean, this time really don't go."
00:14:56.270,00:14:58.147,-I'm running late. I got to go.
00:14:58.189,00:14:59.940,Stay for the trick.
00:14:59.982,00:15:01.984,"-You guys, be good."
00:15:02.026,00:15:04.904,"-Wait, wait, wait, look, look, look... Oh!"
00:15:10.076,00:15:12.787,"Listen, Duke."
00:15:12.829,00:15:19.669,"I-I'm not sure if you're aware, but one of those food bowls, technically, it's reserved for..."
00:15:19.711,00:15:22.296,"I know maybe you didn't read the names, but..."
00:15:22.338,00:15:25.258,-that's my bowl.
00:15:25.299,00:15:28.511,I know that... h-hey...
00:15:28.553,00:15:32.390,"I mean, I-I was just thinking, I don't know, maybe we could institute some ground rules."
00:15:32.432,00:15:34.726,I just thought that...
00:15:34.768,00:15:36.811,Or-or not. I-I don't...
00:15:36.853,00:15:38.229,Here again?
00:15:45.695,00:15:47.154,Aah!
00:15:48.740,00:15:50.116,"Oh, Duke!"
00:15:50.157,00:15:51.743,"Duke, Katie is not..."
00:15:51.785,00:15:54.036,Katie's gonna be so upset when she sees that.
00:15:54.078,00:15:56.997,Katie's... gonna flip out...
00:15:57.039,00:16:00.752,when she sees how...
00:16:00.794,00:16:03.212,"Oh, it's just..."
00:16:03.254,00:16:05.757,"Is it, Duke? Is it?"
00:16:05.799,00:16:08.259,Aw! That's a shame.
00:16:10.344,00:16:13.013,-What are you doing?
00:16:13.055,00:16:14.432,"Oh, nothing. I'm..."
00:16:14.474,00:16:16.267,I'm a cute little doggy. I...
00:16:16.309,00:16:20.104,Katie knows I wouldn't do anything... like this.
00:16:20.146,00:16:22.064,"No, no! Whoa!"
00:16:22.106,00:16:23.107,Oh!
00:16:23.149,00:16:29.029,MAX: This could only be -the work of a dangerous stray...
00:16:29.071,00:16:31.783,...who hasn't laid down a foundation of trust.
00:16:31.825,00:16:33.159,You're the new dog.
00:16:33.200,00:16:36.830,"And, hey, Duke, what'd you go and do this for?"
00:16:38.205,00:16:39.833,-I'm gonna...
00:16:39.874,00:16:41.375,Rip my face off?
00:16:41.417,00:16:43.210,Perfect.
00:16:43.252,00:16:45.713,"Oh, oh, Katie, thank goodness you're here!"
00:16:45.755,00:16:49.383,"I tried to stop him, but he's crazy!"
00:16:52.846,00:16:54.305,"Now, sit!"
00:16:54.347,00:16:56.349,"Okay, okay, okay."
00:16:59.059,00:17:00.770,Lay down.
00:17:02.104,00:17:04.064,Good boy!
00:17:19.998,00:17:21.207,"Hi, Max."
00:17:21.248,00:17:24.251,"-Hey, Gidget."
00:17:24.293,00:17:25.628,Is it a girl dog or a boy dog?
00:17:25.670,00:17:27.505,Not that I care.
00:17:27.547,00:17:30.090,"Oh, that's nobody, Gidget."
00:17:30.132,00:17:32.092,"Yeah, he-he's gonna be gone soon."
00:17:42.687,00:17:45.147,"-Hey, what's up?"
00:17:45.189,00:17:47.775,MAN: Your hat is the best hat I've ever seen.
00:17:47.817,00:17:50.110,WOMAN: Really?
00:17:50.152,00:17:52.112,You forgot my leash.
00:17:55.992,00:17:58.411,"Hey, fellas."
00:17:58.452,00:18:01.080,"Hey, fellas. How's it... Aah!"

00:18:03.499,00:18:05.125,"Oh, uh, say, Duke?"
00:18:05.167,00:18:06.836,Yes?
00:18:06.878,00:18:09.714,"Be a good lad and bring me a stick, won't you?"
00:18:09.756,00:18:14.134,It would please me to chew on a stick just now.
00:18:14.176,00:18:15.595,You heard me.
00:18:15.636,00:18:17.889,Fetch.
00:18:19.640,00:18:22.142,"Nah, nah, nah, nah, n-not that one."
00:18:22.184,00:18:24.103,Th-That one doesn't please me.
00:18:24.144,00:18:25.980,"Find a really good one, Duke."
00:18:30.234,00:18:32.486,"MAX: Yeah, that's it."
00:18:38.534,00:18:40.078,"Hey, Max! Boy!"
00:18:40.119,00:18:43.539,"Oh, wow, there are a ton of sticks over here, Max."
00:18:43.581,00:18:45.165,You should come over and look at 'em.
00:18:45.207,00:18:47.919,"Yeah, I wa... I want to make sure I grab you the right one."
00:18:47.961,00:18:51.130,"Oh, that's very, uh..."
00:18:53.382,00:18:56.135,DUKE: Look at all these sticks!
00:19:00.264,00:19:02.558,"Hey, did you hear that?"

00:19:34.924,00:19:37.301,-So long.
00:19:37.343,00:19:39.219,"Didn't have to be this way, Max."
00:19:39.261,00:19:40.888,-Wait!
00:19:40.930,00:19:43.432,Duke! Please!
00:19:43.474,00:19:46.352,Oy! What's going on here?
00:19:46.393,00:19:48.980,"Mind your own business... Oh, my gosh, what happened to you?"
00:19:49.022,00:19:51.231,"I had a fight, all right?"
00:19:51.273,00:19:52.859,"With a big, stupid dog."
00:19:52.900,00:19:54.318,He lost.
00:19:54.360,00:19:58.447,"DUKE: Oh, you're headed into dangerous territory there, kitty cat."
00:19:58.489,00:20:00.741,"I'd watch your tone, sunshine."
00:20:00.783,00:20:02.451,You know what I'm gonna do?
00:20:02.493,00:20:10.043,"I'm gonna cut you into string, ball you up, and then bat you around for hours, in a game that only I understand."
00:20:10.084,00:20:11.418,Oh. Very nice.
00:20:11.460,00:20:13.004,I'll take that.
00:20:13.046,00:20:14.839,Wha...?

00:20:22.680,00:20:24.306,DUKE: Okay.
00:20:24.348,00:20:28.102,"Get your umbrellas out, kitties, because here they come!"
00:20:28.144,00:20:29.269,The thunder!
00:20:29.311,00:20:31.064,And the lightning!
00:20:31.105,00:20:32.565,Right down on your face!
00:20:36.736,00:20:38.946,"Gosh, there are a lot of you up there."
00:20:38.988,00:20:43.701,I'm talking about the thunder and the lightning that's coming down on all of your collective faces!
00:20:43.743,00:20:45.285,Attack on three...
00:20:45.327,00:20:46.787,two...
00:20:51.209,00:20:54.045,I-I just remembered I got to be somewhere!
00:20:55.337,00:20:57.131,That... that...
00:20:57.173,00:20:58.298,"that guy, huh?"
00:20:58.340,00:20:59.508,Am I right?
00:21:01.094,00:21:02.929,"Okay, I-I... You know what?"
00:21:02.970,00:21:05.223,"Uh, no offense, but, uh, good-bye!"
00:21:22.364,00:21:23.323,Whoa!
00:21:28.412,00:21:30.330,Huh?
00:21:34.376,00:21:35.711,Hey!
00:21:35.753,00:21:38.131,"Hey, you little..."
00:21:39.381,00:21:41.008,Whoa!
00:21:47.848,00:21:48.849,Duke?
00:21:50.392,00:21:51.811,You came back?
00:21:51.852,00:21:54.021,Run!
00:21:56.065,00:21:57.357,Whoa!
00:21:57.399,00:21:59.610,It's the popo!
00:22:04.157,00:22:05.365,Ha!
00:22:06.993,00:22:08.327,Ooh.
00:22:09.411,00:22:10.663,Wait!
00:22:14.416,00:22:17.586,"Two, four, six, eight... Hmm."
00:22:17.628,00:22:19.046,"See you tomorrow, Guillermo."
00:22:19.088,00:22:20.464,You know it.
00:22:20.506,00:22:21.590,Ten...
00:22:21.632,00:22:23.176,"Eh, okay."
00:22:23.217,00:22:25.052,Right.
00:22:26.344,00:22:27.513,Uh-huh.
00:22:27.554,00:22:29.389,"-Sheez, did you see that?"
00:22:29.431,00:22:34.478,"Throw it with your arm, I would not fetch that."
00:22:41.777,00:22:43.737,Aah!
00:22:47.825,00:22:53.455,"I don't like to use this phrase, because it's offensive to our kind, but you are a bad dog!"
00:22:53.497,00:22:55.415,Katie's not gonna like this.
00:22:55.457,00:22:57.584,I-I can't go to the pound.
00:22:58.460,00:23:00.880,What? What's wrong with you?
00:23:00.921,00:23:05.425,"Well, Katie just... she just got me out of the pound."
00:23:05.467,00:23:08.221,And if-if I go back...
00:23:08.262,00:23:11.057,"Max, it's the end of the line for me."
00:23:18.522,00:23:20.566,La Pasi√≥n de la Pasi√≥n.
00:23:22.985,00:23:24.444,Why?
00:23:24.486,00:23:25.738,Why?!
00:23:25.779,00:23:27.447,"What's the matter, Maria?"
00:23:27.489,00:23:28.949,"Maria, your face."
00:23:28.991,00:23:30.701,It wears a thousand sorrows.
00:23:30.743,00:23:32.452,What is wrong?!
00:23:32.494,00:23:36.623,I have come face-to-face with the worst thing in the world.
00:23:36.665,00:23:38.458,"What? Oh, tell me, Maria."
00:23:38.500,00:23:39.626,Tell me now!
00:23:39.668,00:23:42.462,I cannot bear another moment without knowing!
00:23:42.504,00:23:44.464,Loneliness.
00:23:47.301,00:23:49.469,"But, Maria, you cannot be lonely."
00:23:49.511,00:23:51.222,Max!
00:23:51.264,00:23:52.390,Huh?
00:23:52.430,00:23:53.891,"Hey! I see you, squirrel!"
00:23:53.933,00:23:56.310,This is not your area!
00:23:56.352,00:23:58.271,MEL: Don't you try and hide!
00:23:59.772,00:24:01.274,What was that?! How dare you!
00:24:01.315,00:24:03.483,"GIDGET: Hey, guys!"
00:24:03.525,00:24:05.485,"Nobody likes you, squirrels!"
00:24:05.527,00:24:06.486,-Oh!
00:24:07.821,00:24:10.490,"Guys, seriously, where is Max?"
00:24:10.532,00:24:11.992,"Calm down, girl. He's right..."
00:24:12.034,00:24:13.911,Huh. He is gone.
00:24:13.953,00:24:16.080,"Oh, it's fine!"
00:24:13.953,00:24:19.208,I heard him screaming after he disappeared into those bushes!
00:24:20.084,00:24:22.128,Max is gone?!
00:24:22.169,00:24:24.880,This is bad. This is so bad.
00:24:24.922,00:24:29.467,"Maria, if he is your true love, you must go to him!"
00:24:29.509,00:24:31.511,Save him. Save him!
00:24:31.553,00:24:33.264,Yes! Yes!
00:24:33.306,00:24:36.267,-Save my true love!
00:24:36.309,00:24:39.145,"-I'm coming, Max!"
00:24:48.654,00:24:53.451,"Hi, Chloe. If anyone asks, I'm on my way to the roof to look for Max."
00:24:54.576,00:24:56.912,"Okay, bye-bye."
00:25:04.253,00:25:07.006,MAN: Whoa. You see that?
00:25:07.047,00:25:09.300,Yeah. Give me a second.
00:25:11.177,00:25:13.429,"Aw... hey there, cute little bunny."
00:25:13.471,00:25:15.639,What you doing in the middle of the road?
00:25:23.897,00:25:26.442,-Bunny!
00:25:26.484,00:25:29.195,"Hey, what's going on?"

00:25:31.613,00:25:32.656,Save yourself!
00:25:32.698,00:25:33.949,"Shut it, human!"
00:25:33.991,00:25:37.577,Let's do this! Now! Now! Yeah!
00:25:37.619,00:25:39.830,"Hey, get off me!"
00:25:44.626,00:25:46.462,Wait up!
00:25:46.504,00:25:47.713,"Get off me, pig!"

00:26:09.443,00:26:10.403,"Let's go, Ripper!"
00:26:10.444,00:26:12.112,I'm busting you out of here!
00:26:16.867,00:26:19.328,The revolution has begun!
00:26:19.370,00:26:20.620,Liberated forever!
00:26:20.662,00:26:22.622,Domesticated never!
00:26:22.664,00:26:23.832,Yeah...!
00:26:25.125,00:26:26.085,Ow!
00:26:26.126,00:26:28.586,Who's driving this thing?
00:26:39.390,00:26:41.183,Aah!
00:27:00.244,00:27:02.662,Let's go!
00:27:06.041,00:27:08.586,-Who are you guys?
00:27:08.626,00:27:09.669,Who are we?
00:27:09.711,00:27:11.755,Who... are we?
00:27:11.797,00:27:14.674,We... are the Flushed Pets!
00:27:14.716,00:27:18.596,"Thrown away by our owners, and now we are out for revenge!"
00:27:18.636,00:27:21.681,"It's like a club, but with biting and scratching."
00:27:22.724,00:27:23.934,T-Take us with you.
00:27:25.685,00:27:27.687,"I don't think so, pets!"
00:27:27.729,00:27:30.690,"Yeah, you got the stench of domestication all over you."
00:27:30.732,00:27:33.193,"You chose your side, and now you're gonna burn."
00:27:33.235,00:27:35.695,No! Stop!
00:27:35.737,00:27:37.697,I ain't no pet.
00:27:37.739,00:27:39.950,We're-we're just like you guys.
00:27:39.992,00:27:41.701,"-Uh, yeah! That's-that's right."
00:27:41.743,00:27:43.703,"Oh, man, don't get me started on people."
00:27:43.745,00:27:45.289,"Am I right, Duke?"
00:27:45.331,00:27:47.291,"That's why we burned our collars, man!"
00:27:47.333,00:27:48.834,We burned 'em to the ground!
00:27:48.875,00:27:50.836,-And killed our owners.
00:27:50.877,00:27:53.713,"That's too far, maybe?"
00:27:53.755,00:27:55.424,"-Yes, we whacked 'em."
00:27:55.466,00:27:56.800,"Bang, bang, with our own paws!"
00:27:56.842,00:27:59.219,If I had a dime for every owner I killed...
00:27:59.261,00:28:02.055,"-Oh, yeah!"
00:28:02.097,00:28:04.057,'Cause I just killed the one.
00:28:04.099,00:28:06.477,Ooh... whoo!
00:28:06.519,00:28:08.228,"Aw, y'all cold-blooded."
00:28:08.270,00:28:10.730,"Aw, man, you remind me of my boy Ricky."
00:28:10.772,00:28:11.857,He died though.
00:28:11.898,00:28:13.900,"R-I-P, Ricky!"
00:28:13.942,00:28:16.736,"You know, the truth is, the struggle could use some more muscle."
00:28:16.778,00:28:18.738,"All right, look, I'll tell you what."
00:28:18.780,00:28:20.740,"We'll bust the both of you out of here, but understand this."
00:28:20.782,00:28:22.909,"-From now on, you work for me."
00:28:22.951,00:28:24.578,Sounds like a fun challenge.
00:28:25.871,00:28:28.582,"All right, guys, let's do this!"
00:28:32.169,00:28:33.962,To the sewers!
00:28:34.004,00:28:35.755,The sewers?
00:28:35.797,00:28:37.508,What are y'all waiting for?
00:28:37.550,00:28:38.800,I'm not playing!
00:28:38.842,00:28:41.761,I said... to the sewers!
00:28:48.768,00:28:52.064,"SNOWBALL: Long live the revolution, suckers!"
00:28:56.569,00:28:57.903,I can do it.
00:29:01.823,00:29:02.824,Oh!
00:29:03.825,00:29:05.494,Max?
00:29:06.245,00:29:07.787,Max?
00:29:07.829,00:29:09.831,Max! Max!
00:29:09.873,00:29:11.083,Max?
00:29:11.124,00:29:13.293,Max? Max?
00:29:25.138,00:29:27.766,"Oh, where are you, Max?"
00:29:30.436,00:29:33.146,you could use a little help.
00:29:33.188,00:29:35.774,-Who said that?
00:29:35.815,00:29:38.694,In this dark and foreboding shed.
00:29:46.868,00:29:49.079,Uh... hello?
00:29:49.121,00:29:51.415,I can see for miles.
00:29:51.457,00:29:54.834,"If you let me out, I'll find your friend."
00:29:54.876,00:29:56.086,Wow! Really?
00:29:56.128,00:29:58.255,"Aw, you're so sweet."
00:29:58.297,00:30:00.173,"You're sweet, too."
00:30:00.215,00:30:02.217,"Oh, ho-ho. Thanks, stranger."
00:30:03.969,00:30:07.806,"There's also a, uh, salty, gamey thing going on."
00:30:09.015,00:30:12.185,"Come on, let's get you out of that shed."
00:30:12.227,00:30:13.771,"Yeah, that's it."
00:30:13.812,00:30:15.855,Just step over the pile of bones.
00:30:15.897,00:30:18.567,"Pile of bones. Okay, will do."
00:30:18.609,00:30:20.778,I sure hope Max is safe.
00:30:20.819,00:30:22.862,You're a very thoughtful food.
00:30:22.904,00:30:25.449,Food? I didn't say that.
00:30:25.491,00:30:27.701,I said... I meant food.
00:30:27.743,00:30:30.329,F... Friend.
00:30:30.370,00:30:32.872,"I am sure lucky I found you, uh..."
00:30:32.914,00:30:39.421,"Tiberius. And yes, this is a very good thing for you, this whole meeting me thing."
00:30:39.463,00:30:41.881,Take off my hood.
00:30:53.352,00:30:55.437,Aah! The chain!
00:30:56.980,00:30:59.358,Oh! You tried to eat me!
00:31:01.360,00:31:02.569,You should be sorry!
00:31:02.611,00:31:04.154,You deserve to be locked up!
00:31:04.196,00:31:05.947,"You're a bad, bad bird!"
00:31:05.989,00:31:06.948,I can't help it!
00:31:06.990,00:31:08.908,I was born with killer instincts!
00:31:08.950,00:31:11.453,-That is just no excuse!
00:31:11.495,00:31:13.455,"Even for a predator, I'm selfish."
00:31:13.497,00:31:15.708,I'm a selfish predator.
00:31:15.749,00:31:17.959,It's no wonder I have no friends.
00:31:18.001,00:31:18.711,Nobody.
00:31:18.752,00:31:20.920,I... I...
00:31:20.962,00:31:23.048,-This is hopeless. I...
00:31:23.089,00:31:24.883,There's no need to cry.
00:31:24.924,00:31:27.219,I'm sorry that I yelled at you before.
00:31:27.260,00:31:28.928,Please take off the chain.
00:31:28.970,00:31:31.931,This time I'll help you.
00:31:31.973,00:31:33.933,Tiberius...
00:31:33.975,00:31:37.437,"this is gonna sound completely horrible, but, um..."
00:31:37.479,00:31:39.272,I don't fully trust you.
00:31:42.192,00:31:43.652,"Oh, no, no, no, well, but..."
00:31:43.694,00:31:45.738,I guess everyone deserves a second chance.
00:31:45.779,00:31:47.656,"And you are just a lonely, old bird."
00:31:47.698,00:31:51.535,And you do have weird manners because you live in a weird shed on a roof.
00:31:51.577,00:31:53.119,So I'll tell you what.
00:31:53.161,00:31:55.330,If you find Max...
00:31:55.372,00:31:56.956,I'll be your best friend!
00:31:56.998,00:31:59.251,Best friend?
00:31:59.292,00:32:01.628,You and me?
00:32:01.670,00:32:04.715,Whoa!
00:32:06.174,00:32:08.260,Whoa!
00:32:18.978,00:32:21.231,Yes! That sounds nice.
00:32:21.273,00:32:22.482,Let's do this.
00:32:22.524,00:32:24.610,Okay.
00:32:29.823,00:32:32.367,So what does this Max look like?
00:32:32.409,00:32:33.952,Brown and white.
00:32:33.993,00:32:36.914,"He's a short-hair, roguishly handsome."
00:32:36.955,00:32:38.624,He's got a sparkle in his eye.
00:32:38.665,00:32:40.584,He sounds dreamy.
00:32:40.626,00:32:43.002,"Oh, you have no idea."
00:32:43.044,00:32:44.003,"I mean, what?"
00:32:44.045,00:32:45.171,Whatever.
00:32:47.466,00:32:52.220,"If my owner comes, put on the hood and pretend to be me."
00:32:52.262,00:32:53.972,"Okay, thank you!"
00:33:05.233,00:33:08.027,Smell is disgusting...
00:33:08.069,00:33:08.987,ly good.
00:33:09.028,00:33:10.614,This is all so great.
00:33:10.656,00:33:12.365,Love it here.
00:33:21.207,00:33:22.793,-What's...
00:33:22.835,00:33:25.044,-Pass...
00:33:25.086,00:33:26.212,Password?
00:33:26.254,00:33:27.631,Look! Look at me!
00:33:27.673,00:33:29.215,I am your leader.
00:33:29.257,00:33:32.093,The leader does not recite the password!
00:33:32.135,00:33:34.429,"The leader makes up the password, idiots."
00:33:34.471,00:33:36.431,"Everybody, I'm making up a new password right now."
00:33:36.473,00:33:40.894,"The new password is, Don't ask the leader for the password!"
00:33:43.104,00:33:45.064,Follow me.
00:33:51.947,00:33:54.700,"Welcome to the underbelly, brothers."
00:33:54.741,00:33:57.202,Home of the Flushed Pets!
00:34:19.766,00:34:21.643,Brothers and sisters!
00:34:21.685,00:34:26.105,"As you see, I've returned from the surface with two new recruits."
00:34:26.147,00:34:28.901,These guys are owner killers!
00:34:28.942,00:34:30.485,Hey! Hey!
00:34:30.527,00:34:33.071,Settle down!
00:34:33.112,00:34:35.908,"Guys, I want you to tell them how you did it."
00:34:35.949,00:34:37.116,Go ahead.
00:34:35.949,00:34:38.827,Tell them the whole story about how you took out your owner.
00:34:38.869,00:34:39.995,Don't leave out nothing.
00:34:40.037,00:34:41.663,We love gory detail here.
00:34:41.705,00:34:43.122,"-Ah, yeah!"
00:34:43.164,00:34:44.708,-Right.
00:34:44.750,00:34:46.960,N... Okay.
00:34:47.002,00:34:48.587,"-Well, we were like..."
00:34:48.628,00:34:50.213,-Yeah!
00:34:50.255,00:34:53.091,So that's-that's who you're dealing with.
00:34:54.384,00:34:56.428,"Yeah, that story bored me to death."
00:34:56.469,00:34:57.470,Boring!
00:34:57.512,00:34:59.138,Give us detail!
00:34:59.180,00:35:00.682,Okay. Max?
00:35:00.724,00:35:03.351,"Okay, well, uh, so there's this..."
00:35:03.393,00:35:04.978,there's this thing in the kitchen...
00:35:05.020,00:35:06.730,-Yeah. Table!
00:35:06.772,00:35:08.231,-Toaster!
00:35:08.273,00:35:09.649,just the end of it.
00:35:09.691,00:35:10.734,A spoon?
00:35:10.776,00:35:12.151,"-Yes, a spoon!"
00:35:12.193,00:35:14.029,You can't hurt someone with a spoon.
00:35:14.071,00:35:16.155,You scoop with a spoon.
00:35:16.197,00:35:18.366,How many people want to know how to kill somebody with a spoon?
00:35:18.408,00:35:20.285,I do!
00:35:20.326,00:35:25.540,"Uh, okay. Uh, well, we-we used the spoon, hit a button on this, the machine on the counter..."
00:35:25.582,00:35:27.626,"Right, right, right, and it's got those... those blades."
00:35:27.667,00:35:29.962,"-The, uh, you know, the, uh, it's got blades!"
00:35:30.003,00:35:31.296,Was it a blender?
00:35:31.337,00:35:32.589,Whoo!
00:35:32.631,00:35:34.173,You blended somebody?!
00:35:34.215,00:35:36.175,"He talking about the blender, guys."
00:35:36.217,00:35:38.261,"Oh, please tell me it was a blender!"
00:35:38.303,00:35:41.180,"Hey, buddy, I don't ask what it's called, we just kill with it."
00:35:41.222,00:35:43.141,-But it was a blender.
00:35:43.182,00:35:44.350,Do y'all hear this?
00:35:44.392,00:35:46.185,You know who was like this?
00:35:46.227,00:35:47.228,Ricky!
00:35:47.270,00:35:49.188,Rest in peace!
00:35:49.230,00:35:54.569,Ricky was the only soldier I had that was ready to kill humans on sight.
00:35:54.611,00:35:56.571,Everybody else need a pep talk.
00:35:56.613,00:35:58.197,Not these two brothers.
00:35:58.239,00:36:01.076,What's going on?
00:36:01.118,00:36:04.830,"See, all of us have suffered at the hands of man."
00:36:04.871,00:36:06.289,"I mean, take me for instance."
00:36:06.331,00:36:09.126,I was a magician's rabbit for kids' parties.
00:36:09.167,00:36:12.211,But then bunny tricks went out of style.
00:36:12.253,00:36:14.089,So what did my owner do?
00:36:12.253,00:36:17.009,My owner went and left magic behind and made me disappear.
00:36:17.050,00:36:19.260,From his life!
00:36:19.302,00:36:20.095,Uh-huh.
00:36:20.137,00:36:22.139,I lived in a tattoo parlor.
00:36:22.180,00:36:24.641,The trainees used to practice on me.
00:36:24.683,00:36:27.477,Until they ran out of space!
00:36:27.519,00:36:29.354,"SNOWBALL: I mean, yes, humans say they love us."
00:36:29.395,00:36:33.066,But then they turn around and throw us out like garbage.
00:36:33.108,00:36:35.027,"Ain't that right, Sea Monkeys?"
00:36:35.068,00:36:37.236,"Hey, it's not our fault we don't look like the ad!"
00:36:37.278,00:36:38.488,Yeah!
00:36:38.530,00:36:42.159,"All right, you guys are joining the brotherhood."
00:36:42.200,00:36:44.161,-It's initiation time!
00:36:44.202,00:36:45.996,-What?
00:36:46.038,00:36:48.373,Summon the viper!
00:36:50.667,00:36:53.170,"Uh, is this viper poisonous?"
00:36:53.211,00:36:56.214,"Because I should warn you, I'm very allergic to poison!"
00:37:05.348,00:37:08.143,"All right, show her!"
00:37:15.316,00:37:16.359,Where is he?
00:37:16.401,00:37:18.444,Wh-What happened to him?
00:37:18.486,00:37:19.738,I ain't saying nothing.
00:37:21.156,00:37:25.284,"You're gonna tell us where Max is, and you're gonna tell us now."
00:37:26.661,00:37:28.287,Is this supposed to scare me?
00:37:28.329,00:37:29.288,I'm a cat.
00:37:29.330,00:37:30.415,I land on my feet.
00:37:30.456,00:37:32.209,Does it always happen?
00:37:30.456,00:37:34.169,'Cause your head looks like it's taken a lot of landings.
00:37:34.211,00:37:35.461,Do you want me to cut ya?
00:37:35.503,00:37:37.214,'Cause I'll cut ya this way and that.
00:37:37.255,00:37:39.298,You'll look like a waffle.
00:37:39.340,00:37:40.508,Okay.
00:37:40.550,00:37:43.220,He's too stupid to talk and too ugly to eat.
00:37:44.345,00:37:46.305,-I'm done playing nice!
00:37:46.347,00:37:48.600,Where is Max?!
00:37:50.143,00:37:51.310,-Tell me!
00:37:51.352,00:37:53.105,I-I can...
00:37:53.146,00:37:54.898,Let me finish... Ow!
00:37:54.940,00:37:56.441,Help me! Ow!
00:37:56.482,00:37:57.692,Don't look at him.
00:37:57.734,00:37:58.777,Look at me.
00:37:58.818,00:38:00.319,Nobody can help you!
00:38:00.361,00:38:02.906,Where is Max?!
00:38:02.948,00:38:04.950,"Okay, okay!"
00:38:04.991,00:38:06.325,He got taken! Please!
00:38:06.367,00:38:09.328,"Have mercy, adorable puffy dog."
00:38:10.371,00:38:12.707,Snake bite! Snake bite!
00:38:12.749,00:38:14.667,Snake bite!
00:38:14.709,00:38:16.669,Snake bite! Snake bite!
00:38:16.711,00:38:18.838,Snake bite!
00:38:18.880,00:38:21.049,Snake bite! Snake bite!
00:38:25.386,00:38:37.190,"As proof of your allegiance, you will now receive the bite of a one-fanged, half-blind viper fueled by a diet of anti-human rage!"
00:38:56.626,00:38:58.377,Who wants to go first?
00:38:58.419,00:39:00.421,"Uh, yeah."
00:39:00.463,00:39:02.632,"-I mean, it's-it's..."
00:39:02.674,00:39:04.383,Can I call you Tiny Dog?
00:39:04.425,00:39:05.384,It fits you.
00:39:05.426,00:39:07.553,Let's admit that.
00:39:05.426,00:39:10.389,"I mean, look, between you and the fat dog, I like you the best."
00:39:10.431,00:39:11.390,"Oh, thank you."
00:39:11.432,00:39:13.685,Tiny Dog's gonna go first.
00:39:13.726,00:39:15.312,"Everybody, TD's going first!"
00:39:15.353,00:39:16.395,"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
00:39:16.437,00:39:18.231,Tiny Dog does not want to go first!
00:39:18.273,00:39:20.399,Take the fat dog!
00:39:20.441,00:39:22.819,"-No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop!"
00:39:22.861,00:39:24.445,Snake bite!
00:39:24.487,00:39:26.156,Snake bite! Snake bite!
00:39:26.198,00:39:27.448,"-Oh, no, no, no!"
00:39:27.490,00:39:30.409,Snake bite! Snake bite!
00:39:30.451,00:39:34.413,What are you doing initiating a couple domestics?
00:39:34.455,00:39:35.623,Domestics?
00:39:35.665,00:39:37.542,Yeah. We just jumped those two in the alley.
00:39:37.583,00:39:39.252,Slashed off their collars.
00:39:39.294,00:39:40.419,"SNOWBALL: No, no, no."
00:39:40.461,00:39:42.421,You said you burned your collars.
00:39:42.463,00:39:45.550,"Well, burned, lost, had them stolen by cats."
00:39:45.591,00:39:48.136,"It's all just words, really, isn't it?"
00:39:48.178,00:39:50.471,You don't deserve to be marked by the viper.
00:39:50.513,00:39:52.431,"-Oh, no."
00:39:52.473,00:39:55.810,You deserve to be eaten by the viper!
00:39:55.852,00:39:57.979,Get those leash lovers!
00:40:03.943,00:40:05.403,Hold on.
00:40:12.869,00:40:14.412,"Go get 'em, Duke!"
00:40:14.453,00:40:15.454,Whoa.
00:40:51.408,00:40:54.869,"Uh, fellas, that was an accident."
00:40:54.911,00:40:56.996,You squished the sacred viper!
00:40:58.539,00:40:59.958,He's a flapjack!
00:40:59.999,00:41:02.377,"Oh, Viper!"
00:41:02.419,00:41:04.503,"Viper, you in a better place!"
00:41:04.545,00:41:05.671,You and Ricky!
00:41:09.592,00:41:12.637,You ain't never did nothing to nobody!
00:41:12.678,00:41:14.680,"Well, you bit a lot of people, Viper."
00:41:14.722,00:41:16.682,"So, technically, you might actually deserve this."
00:41:16.724,00:41:19.311,This might be something that was long overdue.
00:41:19.352,00:41:21.562,But it shouldn't have came like this!
00:41:21.604,00:41:23.522,Not on my watch!
00:41:23.564,00:41:25.066,Get 'em!
00:41:27.068,00:41:28.527,"Oh, no!"
00:41:28.569,00:41:29.695,Come on!
00:41:53.178,00:41:54.512,We're sorry!
00:41:54.553,00:41:55.930,Can this be over now?
00:41:57.223,00:41:58.308,We've got a problem.
00:41:58.350,00:41:59.684,We have so many problems.
00:41:59.725,00:42:02.228,Which one do you mean at this moment?
00:42:07.192,00:42:08.943,"SNOWBALL: Stop running, dummies!"
00:42:08.985,00:42:10.320,Stop it right now!
00:42:10.362,00:42:11.570,Hold your breath!
00:42:22.790,00:42:26.544,This is my least favorite part of this whole thing so far!
00:42:43.561,00:42:46.605,I am afraid that I have some terrible news.
00:42:46.647,00:42:48.649,The squirrels are gonna take over the world!
00:42:48.691,00:42:50.109,I knew it!
00:42:50.151,00:42:52.945,"I always said, squirrels are little shifty little guys."
00:42:52.987,00:42:55.240,No. We're not doing the squirrel thing right now.
00:42:57.283,00:42:59.118,Max is missing!
00:42:59.160,00:43:00.828,He's out there somewhere.
00:43:00.870,00:43:02.788,Lost. Scared.
00:43:02.830,00:43:04.457,"So, so handsome."
00:43:04.499,00:43:06.834,We have got to find him and bring him home!
00:43:06.876,00:43:10.004,But the outside world is loud and scary.
00:43:11.672,00:43:13.632,"GIDGET: This is my friend, Tiberius."
00:43:13.674,00:43:15.093,He's going to help us.
00:43:15.134,00:43:16.635,He's not going to eat us.
00:43:16.677,00:43:18.637,We've already been over it.
00:43:18.679,00:43:21.640,"We go out there without a leash, we'll get caught by a net."
00:43:21.682,00:43:22.892,Or something worse.
00:43:22.934,00:43:24.727,"Yeah, like a hawk!"
00:43:24.769,00:43:26.020,We're wasting time!
00:43:26.062,00:43:27.646,Max needs us.
00:43:27.688,00:43:30.316,"Come on, girl, Max doesn't even know you're alive."
00:43:30.358,00:43:31.650,"Well, I don't care."
00:43:31.692,00:43:32.651,I love him.
00:43:32.693,00:43:34.653,I love him with all of my heart.
00:43:34.695,00:43:37.782,"And I'm gonna go look for Max, no matter who's with me."
00:43:37.823,00:43:40.618,"So, who's with me?"
00:43:45.748,00:43:47.125,"All right, fine."
00:43:47.166,00:43:48.460,Fine.
00:43:48.501,00:43:51.003,"Oh, come on, guys."
00:43:51.045,00:43:52.797,I can't believe you.
00:43:52.838,00:43:57.676,"When I got my claws caught in the curtains, who pulled me down?"
00:43:57.718,00:43:59.053,Max did.
00:43:59.095,00:44:04.392,"Buddy, Mel, when you were fixed, who taught you to sit the comfortable way?"
00:44:04.434,00:44:06.394,-Max did.
00:44:08.438,00:44:13.359,"And when that random cat tried to eat Sweetpea, who saved him?"
00:44:13.401,00:44:14.527,It wasn't a random cat.
00:44:14.569,00:44:15.820,It was you.
00:44:15.861,00:44:18.239,The identity of the random cat is not the point.
00:44:18.281,00:44:20.699,We're talking about who saved him.
00:44:20.741,00:44:22.701,-Max did!
00:44:22.743,00:44:24.703,-Yeah!
00:44:25.997,00:44:28.707,Yeah! Let's go save Max!
00:44:28.749,00:44:30.709,"Uh, which one is Max again?"
00:44:30.751,00:44:31.669,Oh!
00:44:32.711,00:44:34.713,-Um...
00:44:34.755,00:44:36.007,No!
00:44:36.048,00:44:37.425,"Bad, bad bird!"
00:44:40.886,00:44:42.555,Nice little guy.
00:44:42.597,00:44:43.848,I like this bird.
00:44:43.889,00:44:45.724,-Um...
00:45:17.798,00:45:18.757,Come on!
00:45:18.799,00:45:20.552,We got to get to shore!
00:45:20.593,00:45:22.178,I only know the doggy paddle!
00:45:22.220,00:45:25.139,And I don't know it well!
00:45:25.181,00:45:26.849,"Swim, Tiny Dog! Swim!"
00:45:36.817,00:45:38.069,Duke!
00:45:48.204,00:45:50.164,"Max, grab the ring!"
00:45:50.206,00:45:52.166,I-I can't!
00:45:52.208,00:45:53.459,"Keep it up, Max!"
00:45:53.501,00:45:58.797,"You're doing... Well, you know, you're not doing great, but you're not drowning, and that's something!"
00:46:06.180,00:46:07.806,You're almost there!
00:46:21.320,00:46:22.947,"Thanks, Duke."
00:46:22.988,00:46:24.781,No problem.
00:46:24.823,00:46:27.285,"Finally, I'm going home."
00:46:27.326,00:46:28.785,Uh...
00:46:28.827,00:46:31.205,Isn't home that way?
00:46:31.247,00:46:32.415,Ah!
00:46:32.457,00:46:33.832,Seriously?
00:46:37.629,00:46:39.589,Whee!
00:46:44.343,00:46:45.637,They're going to Brooklyn.
00:46:45.678,00:46:48.431,They say everyone's going to Brooklyn these days.
00:46:48.473,00:46:49.974,It's making a real comeback.
00:46:50.015,00:46:52.644,I'm not talking about hipster real estate trends.
00:46:52.685,00:46:54.853,"I'm talking about vengeance, Tattoo."
00:46:54.895,00:47:01.569,"Death is coming to Brooklyn, and it's got buck teeth and a cotton tail!"
00:47:18.919,00:47:20.963,Let's go!
00:47:34.811,00:47:37.188,Whee!
00:47:39.440,00:47:42.401,"-Hi, how are you?"
00:47:42.443,00:47:43.902,Enchant√©.
00:47:43.944,00:47:45.904,Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
00:48:00.961,00:48:02.714,What is this crazy joint?
00:48:04.757,00:48:07.926,"His owner is never home, so it's kind of a hot spot."
00:48:07.968,00:48:09.928,Pops knows everyone in this city.
00:48:09.970,00:48:12.931,"If he agrees to help us, Max is as good as found."
00:48:12.973,00:48:13.932,Cool!
00:48:13.974,00:48:16.935,"GIDGET: Oh, fabulous!"
00:48:25.444,00:48:26.987,Whoa!
00:48:27.029,00:48:28.155,Whee!
00:48:49.468,00:48:50.803,Tell me you got that!
00:48:50.845,00:48:52.054,"Oh, heck yes, I did."
00:48:52.096,00:48:53.765,"-What's up, Peanut?"
00:48:53.806,00:48:55.099,You see Pops around here?
00:48:55.140,00:48:57.894,"Yeah, he's over there."
00:48:57.934,00:48:59.729,"Hey, Pops."
00:48:59.771,00:49:01.188,Mud and sweet potatoes.
00:49:01.230,00:49:02.481,Pops!
00:49:05.067,00:49:07.612,"Oh, hey, Buddy."
00:49:07.653,00:49:09.113,"How you been, old-timer?"
00:49:09.154,00:49:11.115,Paralyzed.
00:49:12.157,00:49:13.367,Great!
00:49:13.409,00:49:15.994,"Listen, Mr. Pops, our friend Max was taken."
00:49:16.036,00:49:18.247,"Last we heard, he was lost in the sewers."
00:49:18.289,00:49:22.000,Buddy said that maybe you could help us.
00:49:22.042,00:49:25.463,"You know, I do know a guy in the sewers, but, um..."
00:49:25.504,00:49:28.257,"Ah, I-I don't go out anymore."
00:49:30.217,00:49:31.469,Who said that?
00:49:31.510,00:49:32.720,"Oh, I said it."
00:49:32.762,00:49:34.012,"By the way, I meant no offense."
00:49:34.054,00:49:36.223,I just...
00:49:36.265,00:49:37.809,"Welly-well, well, well."
00:49:37.850,00:49:40.102,Looky what we apparently have here.
00:49:40.144,00:49:43.397,Meezy would like to have a look-see.
00:49:43.439,00:49:45.691,Myron! Brows!
00:49:48.068,00:49:49.111,"Oh, no."
00:49:49.153,00:49:50.362,"Oh, yes."
00:49:50.404,00:49:52.824,Me like what me see.
00:49:52.865,00:49:54.575,"Well, what me can see."
00:49:54.617,00:49:56.744,It's all an attractive blur.
00:49:56.786,00:49:58.036,-Uh...
00:49:56.786,00:49:59.079,"-Little lady, this is my city."
00:49:59.121,00:50:00.915,I'll find your friend.
00:50:00.957,00:50:03.208,"All right, party's over!"
00:50:03.250,00:50:05.127,Myron! Vacuum!
00:50:10.090,00:50:13.385,"So where are you from, my fuzzy angel?"
00:50:13.427,00:50:15.220,"Dude, I'm a cat."
00:50:15.262,00:50:16.848,"Well, nobody's perfect."
00:50:24.856,00:50:34.532,"DUKE: DUKE: Oh, man, would you look at that sandwich!"
00:50:34.573,00:50:36.701,All right.
00:50:45.041,00:50:48.086,"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
00:50:50.882,00:50:53.217,"Okay, this, this, this'll be fine."
00:50:53.258,00:50:54.426,We're fine.
00:50:54.468,00:50:55.720,We can find our way home.
00:50:55.761,00:50:58.222,We are descended from the mighty wolf.
00:50:58.263,00:51:05.187,"We have raw, primal instincts that are mere moments away from kicking in and leading us home."
00:51:05.229,00:51:06.856,I cannot wait!
00:51:06.898,00:51:09.149,Here it comes!
00:51:10.192,00:51:11.569,-Anything?
00:51:11.610,00:51:14.112,"Wait! Oh, I..."
00:51:15.280,00:51:16.532,No.
00:51:16.574,00:51:18.116,"I don't know, Duke."
00:51:18.158,00:51:22.120,"Maybe the legend of dogs coming from wolves is just, it's just wrong."
00:51:22.162,00:51:26.625,"I mean, like, maybe one puppy asked his mom, Where did we come from?"
00:51:26.667,00:51:28.335,"And the kid was like, Oh, wolves?"
00:51:28.377,00:51:30.128,"And she was like, Yeah, fine."
00:51:30.170,00:51:31.129,Sausage.
00:51:31.171,00:51:32.423,Huh?
00:51:32.464,00:51:34.258,You smell that?
00:51:34.299,00:51:36.427,"Oh, man, it is."
00:51:36.468,00:51:38.136,Sausage!
00:51:38.178,00:51:39.972,"Well, then, what are we waiting for?"
00:51:40.014,00:51:41.682,"We're coming for you, baby!"
00:51:55.237,00:51:57.949,"Lower the ramp, dummy!"
00:51:57.990,00:51:59.283,Who are they?
00:51:59.324,00:52:05.915,"This is, uh, Puffball, Squash-Face, Weiner Dog, Yellow Bird, Eagle-Eye, Guinea Pig Joe."
00:52:07.207,00:52:09.167,"And, of course, my girlfriend Rhonda."
00:52:12.880,00:52:14.924,Good enough.
00:52:14.966,00:52:16.341,"Come on, let's go!"
00:52:16.383,00:52:18.176,Move it or lose it!
00:52:18.218,00:52:22.765,Every bird instinct I have says don't follow a dog on wheels.
00:52:22.807,00:52:24.308,"Uh, Mr. Pops, sir."
00:52:24.349,00:52:27.478,Shouldn't we be heading to the sewers?
00:52:27.519,00:52:30.731,"Now, if we take the human route, getting there is gonna take days."
00:52:30.773,00:52:34.192,"You may have lots of time, but for me every breath is a cliffhanger."
00:52:34.234,00:52:37.195,"So, we got to take the secret route."
00:52:38.781,00:52:41.826,Okay.
00:52:41.867,00:52:43.661,"Well, that's that, I guess."
00:52:43.702,00:52:44.745,POPS: Come on!
00:52:46.705,00:52:49.000,Get down here.
00:52:52.962,00:52:54.421,Sweetpea...
00:53:06.266,00:53:07.643,Keep moving.
00:53:18.529,00:53:20.114,"Oh, no."
00:53:22.867,00:53:24.242,Stop it!
00:53:24.284,00:53:25.577,Look away!
00:54:07.870,00:54:10.288,"Come on, I don't have all day."
00:54:27.932,00:54:29.767,Whee!
00:54:38.234,00:54:39.944,"Come on, slowpokes."
00:54:39.985,00:54:41.403,-Ugh.
00:54:42.571,00:54:44.615,POPS: It's poo-poo with a dash of caca.
00:54:46.909,00:54:48.077,Scent is getting stronger.
00:54:48.119,00:54:50.246,Oh!
00:54:53.373,00:54:55.834,"Oh, man."
00:55:01.090,00:55:03.341,"Duke, let's eat!"

00:55:14.645,00:55:16.939,"Oh, it smells so good!"
00:55:16.981,00:55:19.483,"Oh, yes!"
00:55:29.660,00:55:30.828,BOTH: Sausages!
00:55:53.184,00:55:55.351,"Come on, boys!"
00:55:59.940,00:56:02.400,Holy schnitzel!
00:56:55.495,00:56:58.165,"BUDDY: Getting a weird vibe, man."
00:57:00.209,00:57:02.961,"All right, now, these guys are a bit testy."
00:57:03.003,00:57:05.297,So just let me do the talking.
00:57:05.339,00:57:07.174,"Hey, you crybaby!"
00:57:07.216,00:57:08.592,Where's the viper at?!
00:57:16.016,00:57:17.851,"Don't you worry, Viper!"
00:57:17.893,00:57:20.437,You will not be forgotten!
00:57:21.521,00:57:24.524,"You will be avenged, Viper!"
00:57:25.525,00:57:28.486,"And if you don't believe me, you can look at my battle plans."
00:57:28.528,00:57:31.448,It's all laid out right here.
00:57:32.324,00:57:35.786,"TATTOO: Uh, boss, I can't tell who anyone is."
00:57:35.827,00:57:38.496,"Well, you got to really look at it to understand it."
00:57:38.538,00:57:41.541,"Like, that's you guys right here, and, see, that's Brooklyn."
00:57:41.583,00:57:44.086,That's where we gonna get them dogs.
00:57:44.128,00:57:45.963,Bam! Bam!
00:57:48.506,00:57:50.508,That ball of fluff's got a screw loose.
00:57:50.550,00:57:51.843,Let's skedaddle.
00:57:51.885,00:57:53.678,"SNOWBALL: But you get it, you see what I'm saying."
00:57:53.720,00:57:56.514,"Bottom line is, I'm coming right for you, Tiny Dog!"
00:57:56.556,00:57:58.475,"And that big, fat, brown dog?"
00:57:58.516,00:57:59.684,"He gonna get it, too."
00:57:59.726,00:58:01.103,Tiny Dog?
00:58:01.145,00:58:02.854,There are lots of tiny dogs in the city.
00:58:02.896,00:58:04.522,"I mean, you're a tiny dog, okay?"
00:58:04.564,00:58:05.607,So let's just go.
00:58:05.649,00:58:08.235,"He also said, big, fat, brown dog."
00:58:08.277,00:58:10.112,Like Max's new roommate.
00:58:10.154,00:58:11.529,Not necessarily.
00:58:11.571,00:58:16.534,"Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, you are gonna get it!"
00:58:17.577,00:58:18.996,That's kind of hard to dispute.
00:58:19.037,00:58:20.998,Hey! You stay away from...!
00:58:22.082,00:58:23.208,"Wait, what?"
00:58:23.250,00:58:24.293,You know Tiny Dog?
00:58:25.961,00:58:27.254,He's my friend!
00:58:27.296,00:58:29.423,And some might say my boyfriend!
00:58:29.465,00:58:31.175,"Uh, nobody says that."
00:58:31.216,00:58:32.592,I can't believe you know Tiny Dog!
00:58:32.634,00:58:34.552,"I mean, that's cool."
00:58:34.594,00:58:36.847,thing about it.

00:58:45.147,00:58:46.106,Not good!
00:58:46.148,00:58:48.025,Aah!
00:58:50.486,00:58:51.945,See you guys later!
00:58:51.987,00:58:53.613,"Oh, hang on!"
00:58:56.616,00:58:58.618,"Everybody, run!"
00:59:03.748,00:59:05.209,"Derick, you idiot!"
00:59:05.250,00:59:06.584,Did they all get away?
00:59:06.626,00:59:08.295,Uh...
00:59:08.337,00:59:12.132,"Phew, that was a close one!"
00:59:12.174,00:59:13.842,"Aw, nuts."
00:59:13.884,00:59:15.593,Yes! We got one!
00:59:16.553,00:59:18.180,"NORMAN: Oh, good for you guys!"
00:59:18.222,00:59:19.764,-Yay!
00:59:19.806,00:59:23.601,"Oh, yes, Tiny Dog, we got your friend!"
00:59:23.643,00:59:25.396,"Advantage, me!"
00:59:27.231,00:59:28.524,Uh-oh.
00:59:28.565,00:59:29.941,Just ignore what just happened.
00:59:29.983,00:59:30.942,Okay?
00:59:33.070,00:59:34.488,Yes!
00:59:38.783,00:59:39.910,You know what?
00:59:39.951,00:59:44.373,"I mean, this may be the sausage talking, but you're okay."
00:59:44.415,00:59:46.458,"Right back at ya, man."
00:59:46.500,00:59:51.296,"You know, when I met you, I was all like, I don't know if I like him."
00:59:51.338,00:59:54.716,"But now that I know you, I'm like, I like him."
00:59:56.927,01:00:01.639,"You know, I saw this place from the outside many times."
01:00:01.681,01:00:09.647,"Had I known what treasures awaited within these walls, I would've broke down that door a long time ago, I'll tell ya!"
01:00:09.689,01:00:11.691,"Uh, what are you talking about?"
01:00:11.733,01:00:14.319,My old owner and I used to live around here.
01:00:14.361,01:00:15.653,"Duke, man, wait."
01:00:15.695,01:00:17.614,D-Did you used to have an owner?
01:00:17.655,01:00:20.492,"Well, it was a..."
01:00:20.534,01:00:22.160,I don't want to talk about it.
01:00:22.202,01:00:23.995,"Yes, you do. Come on."
01:00:24.037,01:00:26.748,I don't know.
01:00:26.790,01:00:28.208,But you know what?
01:00:28.250,01:00:31.295,He was so cool.
01:00:31.336,01:00:32.670,Yeah?
01:00:32.712,01:00:36.341,Yeah. He was the best.
01:00:49.104,01:00:50.939,"DUKE: Man, we had fun."
01:00:53.775,01:00:55.819,We'd play fetch.
01:01:01.074,01:01:02.951,We'd go for walks.
01:01:04.869,01:01:07.705,We'd take naps.
01:01:07.747,01:01:09.833,We were both big nappers.
01:01:23.639,01:01:27.643,"I got out one night, chasing a butterfly or a car."
01:01:27.684,01:01:30.187,By the time I had caught up with it and ate it...
01:01:30.228,01:01:31.729,"Probably a butterfly, then."
01:01:31.771,01:01:36.734,"...I realized I was so far away from my home, I couldn't find it."
01:01:36.776,01:01:41.031,"Few days later, I was picked up by Animal Control."
01:01:43.575,01:01:45.702,I had a great thing going.
01:01:45.743,01:01:48.705,But I had to go and mess it up.
01:01:50.624,01:01:52.750,"Duke, we got to go to your house!"
01:01:52.792,01:01:53.793,Nah.
01:01:53.835,01:01:56.046,"You know, yyour owner's gonna be relieved."
01:01:56.087,01:01:57.422,Will he?
01:01:57.464,01:02:01.385,"Yeah, but-but he never came for me."
01:02:01.426,01:02:03.803,Maybe he...
01:02:03.845,01:02:05.763,Maybe he didn't like me.
01:02:05.805,01:02:07.098,"Hey, of course he liked you."
01:02:07.140,01:02:08.684,He was your owner.
01:02:08.725,01:02:11.061,"I mean, he's probably worried sick."
01:02:11.102,01:02:12.646,I don't know.
01:02:12.688,01:02:14.565,"Well, I do know and we're going."
01:02:14.606,01:02:15.773,Your owner's gonna freak.
01:02:15.815,01:02:18.026,I'm freaking out just thinking about it.
01:02:20.070,01:02:21.321,Okay.
01:02:21.363,01:02:22.780,Let's do it.
01:02:22.822,01:02:24.074,MAN: There they are!
01:02:24.115,01:02:26.743,"All right, doggy, come on."
01:02:28.453,01:02:30.038,-Hey! Hey!
01:02:30.080,01:02:31.582,Where you think you're going?!
01:02:31.623,01:02:33.791,"Come back here, you dogs!"
01:02:44.428,01:02:47.805,That rabbit-- he had crazy eyes.
01:02:47.847,01:02:50.559,There ain't no curing what's wrong with that thing!
01:02:50.601,01:02:52.810,"Gidget, here's an idea."
01:02:52.852,01:02:57.023,Maybe there's a dog in the neighborhood that looks like Max.
01:02:57.065,01:02:58.858,Start hanging out with him.
01:02:58.900,01:03:01.986,"After a while, you'll think it's him, you'll be done."
01:03:02.028,01:03:04.698,We are not just giving up!
01:03:04.740,01:03:05.949,We're dedicated. We're loyal.
01:03:05.990,01:03:07.909,We're easily the greatest pet ever.
01:03:07.951,01:03:08.993,We're dogs!
01:03:09.035,01:03:10.787,-Cat.
01:03:11.580,01:03:12.830,"Well, congratulations!"
01:03:12.872,01:03:15.166,"Today you're dogs, whether you like it or not."
01:03:15.208,01:03:16.334,Sweet.
01:03:16.376,01:03:18.836,Now let's find Max before that rabbit does.
01:03:18.878,01:03:19.837,Break!
01:03:19.879,01:03:22.215,We're dogs!
01:03:26.886,01:03:27.929,I don't like it.
01:03:36.813,01:03:38.898,"Yep, they were here."
01:03:38.940,01:03:40.108,Excellent.
01:03:40.150,01:03:41.610,We're closing in!
01:03:41.652,01:03:43.861,"This is groundbreaking evil behavior, people."
01:03:43.903,01:03:45.363,Groundbreaking.
01:03:53.871,01:03:54.872,SNOWBALL: Oh!
01:03:54.914,01:03:57.417,Lightbulb just went off in my brain.
01:03:57.459,01:03:59.836,The bunny has an idea.
01:04:02.380,01:04:04.341,"Okay, so, um, how do I look?"
01:04:04.382,01:04:05.967,You look great.
01:04:07.093,01:04:08.261,How do I smell?
01:04:08.303,01:04:09.680,"Like a dog, Duke."
01:04:09.721,01:04:11.139,"Relax, man."
01:04:12.974,01:04:15.644,There it is.
01:04:18.938,01:04:20.398,"Well, go on up."
01:04:20.440,01:04:22.192,Go scratch at that door.
01:04:27.238,01:04:29.199,Remember that sausage factory?
01:04:29.240,01:04:30.826,"That was fun, huh?"
01:04:30.867,01:04:32.285,Are you stalling?
01:04:32.327,01:04:34.912,No. Why do you think that?
01:04:34.954,01:04:37.915,Let's have a long talk about why you think I'm stalling.
01:04:37.957,01:04:39.835,"Duke, you have nothing to be nervous about."
01:04:39.876,01:04:41.878,Your owner is gonna be thrilled to see you.
01:04:44.964,01:04:46.591,Okay.
01:04:49.511,01:04:52.764,"Huh, that car is new."
01:05:00.104,01:05:02.106,Can I help you?
01:05:04.317,01:05:06.403,"No. We're good, thanks."
01:05:06.444,01:05:08.154,You're not good.
01:05:08.196,01:05:14.619,"And I'm gonna have to ask you to get off my lawn before I get, um, you know, what you have."
01:05:14.661,01:05:16.246,This is my lawn.
01:05:16.287,01:05:17.955,"Duke, maybe we should go."
01:05:17.997,01:05:20.958,And why...
01:05:21.000,01:05:22.085,He hates cats.
01:05:22.126,01:05:24.212,That's one of the things I love about him.
01:05:24.254,01:05:27.340,Fred? The old guy?
01:05:27.382,01:05:30.009,"He, um..."
01:05:30.051,01:05:31.969,He died.
01:05:33.513,01:05:36.057,"Duke, maybe I made a mistake saying we should come here."
01:05:36.099,01:05:37.975,L-Let's... let's go.
01:05:38.017,01:05:39.519,You're a liar.
01:05:39.561,01:05:41.605,"Max, cats lie all the time."
01:05:41.646,01:05:43.940,Don't fall for it.
01:05:49.028,01:05:49.946,Who are they?
01:05:53.283,01:05:54.992,"Hey, this is my home!"
01:05:55.034,01:05:56.244,Go away!
01:06:00.957,01:06:03.794,"Duke, it's-it's time to go."
01:06:03.835,01:06:06.797,"Duke, let's go. Come on!"
01:06:06.838,01:06:08.673,This isn't your home anymore.
01:06:08.715,01:06:11.008,"Why did you bring me here, Max?"
01:06:11.050,01:06:13.010,Wait a minute.
01:06:13.052,01:06:14.971,"You know, I was trying to help you."
01:06:15.012,01:06:17.265,You were trying to get rid of me!
01:06:17.307,01:06:19.559,"Yeah, you know what, Duke?"
01:06:19.601,01:06:20.602,I don't need this.
01:06:20.644,01:06:22.228,I'll see ya later.
01:06:22.270,01:06:23.647,MAN: Gotcha!
01:06:23.688,01:06:26.608,"come on, settle down!"
01:06:29.402,01:06:31.028,"-Go home, Max!"
01:06:31.070,01:06:33.740,"MAN: Hey, help me out here!"
01:06:33.782,01:06:35.617,Hold on! I'm coming!
01:06:36.660,01:06:38.870,Let's go!
01:06:38.912,01:06:40.580,"Finally got you, big fella."
01:06:40.622,01:06:41.998,"Whoa, whoa, come on."
01:06:42.039,01:06:44.709,This is it for you.
01:06:50.256,01:06:51.299,Duke!
01:07:04.270,01:07:05.355,Whoa!
01:07:16.700,01:07:17.659,Oh.
01:07:17.701,01:07:20.036,"Coochie, coochie coo!"
01:07:33.299,01:07:34.801,Tiny Dog!
01:07:35.593,01:07:36.803,SNOWBALL: Ya!
01:07:36.845,01:07:38.680,"Ah, are you kidding me?"
01:07:38.722,01:07:41.641,"You thought this was over, Tiny Dog?"
01:07:41.683,01:07:43.434,"Ya, ya, ya!"
01:07:47.522,01:07:49.190,Huh?
01:07:54.029,01:07:55.112,Body blow! Body blow!
01:07:55.154,01:07:56.239,Karate chop to your neck!
01:07:56.280,01:07:57.615,Would you...
01:07:57.657,01:07:59.784,Would... would you get off me?
01:08:01.870,01:08:03.830,SNOWBALL: Tattoo!
01:08:05.122,01:08:09.044,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
01:08:12.964,01:08:19.763,"Oh, TD, this kills me to say, but we got to join forces, man."
01:08:29.522,01:08:30.982,Whoo!
01:08:31.024,01:08:33.484,"Ha! We make a great team, Tiny Dog!"
01:08:33.526,01:08:37.154,"Well, mainly, I'm doing all the hard work, but you're helping."
01:08:37.196,01:08:39.156,"Yes, yes, fine. Just keep your eyes on the road."

01:08:51.419,01:08:53.004,Always keeping me in check.
01:09:01.054,01:09:02.305,Do you see the van?
01:09:02.346,01:09:03.640,"Yeah, I see it."
01:09:03.681,01:09:05.391,We're about to hit it.
01:09:30.541,01:09:32.460,"Relax, Snowball, I got you."
01:09:32.502,01:09:34.129,DERICK: There he is!
01:09:34.170,01:09:36.172,He's got Snowball.

01:10:02.490,01:10:03.825,Snowball and I are on the same side now.
01:10:03.867,01:10:06.077,"Dude, tell 'em."
01:10:06.119,01:10:08.496,That raccoon is lying!
01:10:08.538,01:10:10.665,He's not the president.

01:15:52.631,01:15:53.716,Not us.
01:15:53.757,01:15:59.889,Now it's back to our primary mission: the downfall of the human race.
01:15:59.930,01:16:01.682,"It is on, humans!"

01:19:04.823,01:19:07.784,"Oh, my boys."
01:19:07.826,01:19:08.785,"So, how'd it go?"
01:19:08.827,01:19:10.120,"Great, right?"
01:19:10.162,01:19:11.247,I...
01:19:11.288,01:19:13.040,Uh...
01:19:13.082,01:19:16.293,"So, maybe a few bumps."
01:19:16.335,01:19:19.213,But I knew this was gonna work out.
01:19:19.255,01:19:21.507,"So, who's hungry?"
01:19:33.728,01:19:36.313,"Welcome home, Duke."

01:21:01.774,01:21:03.066,"Oh, you guys look weird."
01:21:03.108,01:21:04.485,"Hurry up, come on in!"
01:21:09.824,01:21:11.617,You said it was a costume party.
01:21:11.659,01:21:13.410,Why do you listen to me?
