00:25:37.077,00:25:38.662,"But the police are right there, though."
00:28:49.144,00:28:50.562,"Ah, damn dude."

00:47:10.285,00:47:11.537,Let me make a suggestion.
00:47:12.120,00:47:14.248,Be more romantic and less sexual.
00:47:14.665,00:47:15.582,At first.
00:47:15.666,00:47:19.545,Let her know that the sun rises and sets in her beautiful face.
00:47:20.212,00:47:22.130,Her eyes mesmerize you...
00:47:26.343,00:47:27.886,Don't go with sexual at first.
00:47:36.478,00:47:38.856,"Thirty minutes to an hour, at least."
00:47:40.649,00:47:42.276,"I'm a very sensual person, just not a slut."
00:47:43.443,00:47:46.530,"I love sex, I've had sex with a lot of different..."
00:47:47.322,00:47:48.615,Genders and genres...
00:51:26.458,00:51:27.709,Look what she wrote.
00:51:27.834,00:51:29.795,They stole my car and I want it back...
00:51:29.878,00:51:31.379,or I will kill them both.
00:51:31.463,00:51:33.298,That's called a terrorist threat.
00:51:33.423,00:51:34.800,You'll get locked up for that.
00:53:34.586,00:53:36.880,Get your ass from by me with your bullshit.
00:53:36.963,00:53:38.089,"Go ahead on, sir."
00:53:38.173,00:53:39.883,I ain't gonna tell you shit.
00:53:56.608,00:53:58.693,What the heck is happening?
00:54:04.032,00:54:05.992,"I don't forget shit, I'm in security."

00:54:40.151,00:54:43.238,That's a staple gun! That's just a staple gun.
00:54:43.571,00:54:44.572,You sure?
00:54:44.864,00:54:47.742,"Jackie, you talk too much. You talkin' too much."
00:54:48.201,00:54:49.286,Shiiiiiiiit.
00:56:32.764,00:56:34.766,All I'm going to tell y'all is don't mention that shit.
00:56:35.600,00:56:36.726,That's all I'm going to say.
00:56:36.810,00:56:37.769,They'll fucking nail you.
00:56:37.852,00:56:39.813,Just don't even tell them that shit.
01:06:39.203,01:06:40.871,Can't believe I'm doing this.
01:11:09.515,01:11:10.808,How can I help him?
01:11:10.933,01:11:12.726,Go stand under the damn thing.
01:14:08.360,01:14:09.862,I wasn't ready for this.

01:15:11.924,01:15:13.217,"Cry, and it's fine."
01:15:13.300,01:15:15.677,"When you cry, you feel better."
01:16:50.314,01:16:51.607,"Get your own, okay?"
01:16:56.903,01:16:58.113,I'm not interested.
00:00:49.966,00:00:51.176,Woo!

00:00:57.474,00:00:58.975,-Good. Is this your Beemer? -Yeah.
00:00:59.059,00:01:01.102,Cool. I'm almost done. I just gotta do the interior.
00:01:01.186,00:01:02.604,"-I'm Chris, by the way. -Keith."
00:01:02.687,00:01:04.689,"Nice to meet you. It'll be five minutes, tops."
00:01:04.773,00:01:06.691,"-You're good. Take your time. -Where you from, man?"
00:01:06.775,00:01:08.026,"Birmingham, Alabama."
00:01:08.109,00:01:11.529,"Birmingham? Whoa, okay. I'm a Florida guy, born and raised."
00:01:11.613,00:01:13.865,"Just trying to hustle, do my thing, you know?"
00:01:13.948,00:01:15.325,"Yeah, same here."
00:01:15.408,00:01:17.619,"-Gotta fake it till you make it, right? -That's it."
00:01:20.330,00:01:21.623,"Right on, cool."
00:01:21.706,00:01:44.729,"I knew a guy that, like, got a, uh… I swear to God, that's my crush from high school."
00:01:44.813,00:01:46.648,"-For real? -Yeah, yeah, that's Maria Li."
00:01:46.731,00:01:48.775,"-For real? -I haven't seen her in forever, man."
00:01:48.858,00:01:52.320,"I'm like… I'm like, shak-- Yeah, dude. That's why I, like, got quiet."
00:01:52.403,00:01:55.573,I promised myself next time I saw her I was gonna ask her out.
00:01:55.657,00:01:57.992,-I don't even know if she remembers me. -Shoot your shot!
00:01:58.076,00:01:59.702,-You think so? -Yeah.
00:01:59.786,00:02:02.247,"-I look like a shlub, though. -Ah, you look good, man."
00:02:02.330,00:02:03.164,You think so?
00:02:03.248,00:02:06.376,"You should go do it. Just, Hey, how you doing? You remember me?"
00:02:06.459,00:02:08.461,"Yeah. Yeah, okay. All right, cool."
00:02:08.545,00:02:11.840,"All right, let me-- I'll vacuum your car, and then I'll get you out of here."
00:02:13.049,00:02:15.969,"Can you just hit that On switch on the vacuum for me? Thanks, man."
00:02:16.052,00:02:17.720,"-Right here? -Yeah, yeah. Thanks, man."
00:02:18.805,00:02:28.731,"Yeah, there's probably so many other guys-- Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit! What the fuck!"
00:02:32.235,00:02:35.280,Oh my God. Turn it off! What did you press? Turn it off. What the fuck?
00:02:35.363,00:02:37.574,"-I'm gonna get fired again. -Oh, shit."
00:02:37.657,00:02:39.993,"Give me your jacket. Jacket, jacket, jacket, jacket!"
00:02:40.076,00:02:42.579,"Thanks, man. Holy fuck, why, why, why?"
00:02:42.662,00:02:44.539,-What did you do? -I just pressed On!
00:02:46.207,00:02:49.460,"Oh, now that's Maria. That's Maria. Holy shit."
00:02:53.047,00:02:55.758,"Um, do you know how long an interior detail takes?"
00:02:55.842,00:02:58.469,"I'm a little bit in a rush, and don't know how long it's gonna take."
00:02:58.553,00:02:59.679,I'm not sure.
00:02:59.762,00:03:00.763,Psst.
00:03:00.847,00:03:02.640,Don't let her leave! Don't let her leave!
00:03:02.724,00:03:05.810,"You know, I'm-- I'm just gonna go to another car wash."
00:03:08.021,00:03:10.315,Get her number. Get her number. Get her number.
00:03:10.398,00:03:11.232,-Excuse me. -Yeah.
00:03:11.316,00:03:13.526,Can I get your number to have somebody call you?
00:03:13.610,00:03:17.197,"My number? No. Uh… Thank you, though. I-- I'm good. Thanks."
00:03:22.452,00:03:25.246,"Hey, dude, what… what the fuck just happened?"
00:03:25.330,00:03:26.414,"She just left, dude?"
00:03:27.207,00:03:28.041,Fuck!
00:03:29.751,00:03:31.169,"I was so close, though."
00:03:31.252,00:03:33.671,"-No, you weren't! -Damn it."
00:03:40.762,00:03:42.347,It's crazy. Let's hang out.
00:03:49.604,00:03:52.148,Is there any way you could possibly fix it?
00:03:52.232,00:03:56.402,"I don't know if it's ruined completely, but-- I think it's something we can actually do."
00:03:59.614,00:04:01.866,"Yeah, for some reason, everybody's breaking their phones."
00:04:27.141,00:04:28.893,"What-- What up, Trina? What's up?"
00:04:29.519,00:04:31.896,Nothing much. How you doing?
00:04:31.980,00:04:34.190,"-Hi, how are you? -Good, good, good."
00:04:34.274,00:04:35.858,Y'all see that car right there?
00:04:35.942,00:04:38.444,"-That's yours? -Yeah, that's my Bad Bitch right there."
00:04:38.528,00:04:41.781,"When you see it, it makes everything okay, 'cause it's kinda like Pepto Bismol."
00:04:41.864,00:04:44.284,-There you go! -It fixes-- It fixes everything.
00:04:44.367,00:04:47.245,I like to drink Pepto Bismol with a little bit of Hennessy in it.
00:04:49.205,00:04:50.373,What you need?
00:04:50.456,00:04:52.041,I need 50 bucks.
00:04:53.334,00:04:56.838,I'm at work. You can't ask me for money in front of everybody like that.
00:04:56.921,00:04:58.631,"-I'm sorry about that. -No, no, that's okay."
00:04:58.715,00:05:00.258,This is my little brother. Come on.
00:05:00.341,00:05:02.343,"First of all, ain't you supposed to be on house arrest?"
00:05:05.763,00:05:06.806,Let me hold 50.
00:05:08.683,00:05:09.684,"Come on, bro."
00:05:10.977,00:05:11.853,I got 20 dollars.
00:05:11.936,00:05:13.646,-Twenty dollars? -That's all I got.
00:05:13.730,00:05:14.647,-That's it? -That's it.
00:05:15.231,00:05:17.317,-I know you got more than that. -What are you doing?
00:05:19.235,00:05:21.654,-Look at this. -That's just three dollars.
00:05:22.363,00:05:24.157,"-You playin' with me? -No, that's my lunch money."
00:05:24.240,00:05:27.452,"No, this mine. I'm so sick of you with your fucking crap."
00:05:32.290,00:05:34.375,Fucking crybaby-ass bitch.
00:05:36.294,00:05:37.795,You ain't never gonna get out this town.
00:05:37.879,00:05:39.547,You ain't never gonna be shit.
00:05:39.630,00:05:42.383,You know what? Fuck house arrest. Fuck all this shit.
00:05:45.595,00:05:50.183,And here… Keep your mouth shut.
00:05:52.352,00:05:54.479,Don't say nothing. I remember faces.
00:05:55.480,00:05:58.483,I'll kill every one of you white motherfuckers if you snitch.
00:06:05.865,00:06:08.284,Got you a snack to cheer you up.
00:06:08.368,00:06:10.286,Cheers. Ping!
00:06:13.331,00:06:15.375,"Don't let her get in your mind, bro."
00:06:15.458,00:06:17.126,"Gotta stand up to her, man."
00:06:17.627,00:06:20.254,You know my sister. It's hard to stand up to her. She's a bully.
00:06:21.881,00:06:26.177,"I think Trina's right, man. I think… I don't think we ever gone get outta this town, man. I hate that shit."
00:06:26.260,00:06:28.304,"No, Trina is not right, dog."
00:06:28.388,00:06:32.141,"I'm telling you, seeing Maria today, that was a positive omen, man."
00:06:32.725,00:06:38.940,"Mark my words. By this time next year, we're gonna be out of these jobs, we're gonna be going on big adventures."
00:06:39.649,00:06:40.483,All right.
00:07:10.847,00:07:12.557,-Who are you? -I'm a plumber.
00:07:12.640,00:07:13.724,What time is it?
00:07:15.017,00:07:17.437,"Fuck, I'm late. I'm late! I'm late for work!"
00:07:26.863,00:07:30.241,Son of a… I cannot get fired!
00:07:30.867,00:07:31.742,Goddammit!
00:08:08.029,00:08:11.616,Sorry! I… I thought the window was open!
00:08:12.116,00:08:13.743,"I'm late for work, my bad!"
00:08:38.100,00:08:39.685,-Bye! -Bye!
00:08:43.105,00:08:44.023,Fuck!
00:08:51.155,00:08:52.240,Sorry!
00:08:52.323,00:08:53.824,"What the fuck, dude?"
00:09:01.332,00:09:03.125,Sorry about that. Sorry. You okay?
00:09:03.209,00:09:04.168,-Yeah. -Sorry.
00:09:04.710,00:09:06.837,-Allow me. Ladies first. -Thank you.
00:09:07.463,00:09:08.381,After you.
00:09:09.590,00:09:11.634,All right! Nice! I made it!
00:09:20.059,00:09:24.480,"Uh, it kind of makes you poop. You'll be in the bathroom for a while."
00:09:31.279,00:09:33.281,Pour some of this in there.
00:09:34.574,00:09:36.450,Mango or whatever.
00:09:37.535,00:09:40.538,Why would you put a spoon in there if you're gonna use your hand?
00:09:40.621,00:09:41.998,"Oh, sometimes I forget."
00:09:42.081,00:09:44.917,"You know, the best chefs in the world use their hands."
00:09:45.001,00:09:47.503,"-So-- -No, no, no, no, no."
00:09:47.587,00:09:48.838,That's unacceptable.
00:09:48.921,00:09:52.049,"Yeah, I work in health care, and he just broke all the laws."
00:09:52.133,00:09:56.762,"You work in health care, you know germs actually help your immune system."
00:09:56.846,00:10:06.480,"No, no, no. You're touching the counters, touching all these different things, and then you gonna put your hand in there and comment you're a chef, and we're supposed to accept that?"
00:10:06.564,00:10:14.655,"Here, you want money or something? Like… You can take out of this jar. Like, it doesn't even go to that. Like… Can we just all settle on that?"
00:10:26.959,00:10:28.502,What in the world?
00:10:39.263,00:10:41.515,She's a-- She's a-- She's a VIP customer.
00:10:41.599,00:10:44.101,-Oh! -Yeah! Just cut in front of these people.
00:10:44.185,00:10:46.103,"-Hi, sorry. -Sorry, guys."
00:10:46.187,00:10:47.855,"How you gonna do that, right there?"
00:10:47.938,00:10:52.860,"She's a VIP, but we're in line, and we gotta get waited on."
00:10:52.943,00:10:54.278,-Sorry. -Chris Carey!
00:10:54.987,00:10:56.822,From high school biology class!
00:11:01.285,00:11:03.579,Yeah! How the hell are you?
00:11:03.663,00:11:05.915,"-Oh my God, Chris! -I haven't seen you in forever!"
00:11:05.998,00:11:08.501,Yeah. I'm actually living in New York City.
00:11:08.584,00:11:11.087,"-Wow, New York. The Big Apple. -Yeah."
00:11:14.924,00:11:16.884,What are you doing there? I've never been.
00:11:16.967,00:11:25.351,"Oh, um, actually, I'm a curator at an art gallery, so… Um, here, uh, have a juice on the house."
00:11:27.019,00:11:29.689,This is terrible. This is not good at all.
00:11:29.772,00:11:34.276,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm at work, and it gets crazy at work sometimes."
00:11:34.360,00:11:35.820,This is not good.
00:11:36.570,00:11:47.456,"What are you… uh, uh… What um… w-w-what would you say, like… What are you… What are you doing later? Do you wanna get a bite or something?"
00:11:48.290,00:11:54.088,"I-- Gah, I would-- I would love to, actually, but I'm… I'm on my way to the airport right now."
00:11:54.171,00:11:57.758,There's this big art show I'm doing on Friday that I have to get back for.
00:11:57.842,00:11:58.676,"Oh, okay."
00:11:58.759,00:12:00.094,"-So, yeah. -Okay. Cool."
00:12:00.177,00:12:04.432,"But listen, if you're ever in Manhattan, you should come to the gallery."
00:12:04.515,00:12:05.808,-Wait. What? -Yeah.
00:12:11.188,00:12:13.482,"-For real? -Yeah, I'll show you around."
00:12:15.151,00:12:16.694,-This is so great. -This is great.
00:12:22.074,00:12:23.033,See ya!
00:12:27.371,00:12:28.414,Can we order now?
00:12:45.181,00:12:46.724,"Oh my God, he fell down!"
00:13:02.490,00:13:05.868,"You mind if I, uh… ask you for advice?"
00:13:05.951,00:13:11.207,"I just saw my dream girl, and I finally mustered up the courage to ask her out."
00:13:11.290,00:13:12.666,"I'm, like, in total shock."
00:13:14.418,00:13:16.712,"Why, 'cause she accepted, or what?"
00:13:16.796,00:13:18.881,"Yes, but she lives in New York. That's the catch."
00:13:19.465,00:13:22.134,"And, like, I've never felt this way about a woman before."
00:13:22.218,00:13:23.803,What do you have going here?
00:13:23.886,00:13:26.013,I don't got anything going here. That's the thing.
00:13:26.096,00:13:29.433,"I got, you know-- My best friend lives here, my friend Bud."
00:13:29.517,00:13:33.020,"Man, you know, I say… go for it."
00:13:33.729,00:13:40.236,"If you don't, the rest of your life you're gonna be sitting here saying, What if I woulda, What if I… You get it."
00:13:40.861,00:13:42.321,"Yeah, what am I doing here?"
00:13:43.197,00:13:46.784,I can't… I can't just wait around and hope for things to happen.
00:13:46.867,00:13:48.035,I gotta make it happen.
00:13:48.118,00:13:49.620,There you go. Claim it.
00:13:51.831,00:13:53.874,"Thank you, man. Thanks for the advice, man."
00:13:53.958,00:13:55.125,Ha!
00:13:55.918,00:13:57.253,I'm going to New York.
00:14:17.982,00:14:31.036,What the-- I owe you. Thank you.
00:14:31.495,00:14:32.538,Whoo!
00:14:32.621,00:14:34.582,"I'm going to New York, brother. Thank you."
00:14:35.124,00:14:36.375,Whoo!
00:14:37.543,00:14:40.838,He's in love! He is crazy.
00:14:49.889,00:14:51.181,What are you doing?
00:14:52.433,00:14:53.726,Get the fuck away from me.
00:16:01.877,00:16:02.962,The fuck?
00:16:06.840,00:16:13.472,"Maria just fell outta the sky into my lap today and said, Chris, I haven't seen you in ages. What have you been up to?"
00:16:13.555,00:16:17.142,"And I go, I dunno, I've just been working at the mall since high school."
00:16:17.226,00:16:26.235,"And she was like, Well, good news. I'm your guardian fucking angel, and I'm gonna take you out of this hellscape and bring you to the motherfucking promised land!"
00:16:26.735,00:16:28.946,"So what? I mean, what does that mean?"
00:16:29.029,00:16:30.197,"Look at our lives, man."
00:16:30.781,00:16:33.033,"Stuck in Florida, spinning our wheels."
00:16:33.117,00:16:35.285,Bullshit job after bullshit job.
00:16:36.120,00:16:38.288,"It's finally time for that big adventure, brother."
00:16:38.372,00:16:43.085,I'm talking road trip to the NYC!
00:16:43.168,00:16:44.962,Has anybody here been to New York City?
00:16:53.429,00:16:55.472,"Come on, New York, man! Pizza!"
00:16:58.767,00:17:01.603,"-I hear you, right. And it sounds good. -Yeah."
00:17:01.687,00:17:03.522,But how we gone get there? We don't have a car.
00:17:04.815,00:17:05.858,I figured it out.
00:17:10.779,00:17:13.699,"Hell, no. We're not taking Trina's car. You fucking crazy?"
00:17:13.782,00:17:15.743,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hear me out. Hear me out."
00:17:16.410,00:17:18.787,You're the one paying to store her car.
00:17:18.871,00:17:19.997,-Right? -Yes.
00:17:20.080,00:17:21.206,Trina is in jail.
00:17:21.290,00:17:25.127,She's been in jail. She's gonna stay in jail.
00:17:25.210,00:17:28.505,"She is in J-A-I-L, prison."
00:17:28.589,00:17:31.383,I'm not doing this. Trina is crazy. You know that.
00:17:31.467,00:17:33.385,-I know. -We can't take her-- It's her car.
00:17:33.469,00:17:36.013,"Just for once in your whole life, forget about Trina."
00:17:36.096,00:17:37.473,Think about us.
00:17:37.556,00:17:43.771,"Let's steal that goddamn car and go to New York and have the adventure of a lifetime, like we always talked about."
00:17:45.439,00:17:46.398,I hate you.
00:17:54.073,00:17:55.699,Here you are. Bud Malone.
00:17:55.783,00:17:57.409,"Yeah, we're driving to New York."
00:17:58.035,00:17:59.244,Looks good.
00:17:59.328,00:18:00.704,-What's your name again? -Kurt.
00:18:00.788,00:18:03.332,"-Kurt, Chris. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, man."
00:18:16.887,00:18:18.514,Toot toot!
00:18:23.143,00:18:25.604,I went on Google Maps yesterday. I got everything together.
00:18:25.687,00:18:32.945,"Gonna take the I-95. It'll be the quickest way to get to New York City-- No rush, mi amigo. We got four whole days till Maria's art opening."
00:18:33.028,00:18:36.115,"We can kick back, relax, and breathe in America, dude."
00:18:38.158,00:18:41.703,"Hey. Feet down, man. You cannot mess up my sister's car, man."
00:18:42.287,00:18:43.580,Will you relax?
00:18:43.664,00:18:47.209,The car is fine. Your sister's in prison. She'll never know.
00:19:10.691,00:19:11.692,Bus is all clear.
00:19:19.491,00:19:20.742,Psst.
00:19:22.744,00:19:24.663,I'm stuck up here. I'm stuck.
00:19:25.455,00:19:26.665,Can you help me get out?
00:19:27.624,00:19:30.711,"Please. I'm stuck under here. Oh, God."
00:19:36.925,00:19:37.801,"Oh, shit."
00:19:40.846,00:19:41.930,"Oh, man."
00:19:42.014,00:19:44.349,You see any guards out here or anything?
00:19:46.268,00:19:48.645,You'd better take your ass off. You better take off.
00:19:48.729,00:19:50.772,You'd better fucking-- You better run.
00:19:50.856,00:19:55.027,"Thank you. I'm gonna get in my car, go to Mexico, and just start all over."
00:19:55.110,00:19:57.529,Get those clothes off and get the fuck out of here.
00:19:57.613,00:19:58.947,Can I borrow your vest?
00:19:59.031,00:20:00.490,I can't give you my vest.
00:20:00.574,00:20:02.367,You're my lookout. I never forget a face.
00:20:02.451,00:20:03.577,Go.
00:20:03.660,00:20:05.495,Thank you for helping me escape!
00:20:10.417,00:20:13.003,We had a convict escape. Did you see anyone?
00:20:15.047,00:20:16.131,Where?
00:20:16.215,00:20:19.301,Where? They were here somewhere. Did you see anybody?
00:20:19.384,00:20:20.344,No.
00:20:20.427,00:20:23.263,-So someone escaped? -And you haven't helped her at all?
00:20:23.347,00:20:25.641,"No, how am I gonna help her?"
00:20:25.724,00:20:27.309,By giving her my vest?
00:20:27.392,00:20:29.770,I don't know. Did you see someone out here?
00:20:29.853,00:20:31.146,I need to know that.
00:20:31.980,00:20:32.898,Go that way.
00:20:34.024,00:20:34.858,That way?
00:20:35.359,00:20:37.361,-Someone went that way? -Go that way.
00:20:37.444,00:20:39.404,-Go that way? -Go that way.
00:20:39.488,00:20:42.824,Okay. It's an emergency. We got an emergency here.
00:20:53.168,00:20:55.295,"-Go, go, go. He's looking for you. -Really?"
00:20:55.379,00:20:58.882,"-They're looking for you. Go. -Oh, shoot. Thank you so much."
00:20:58.966,00:21:01.176,I really appreciate you. You got a baby mama?
00:21:01.260,00:21:03.929,"Run away, please. Get away from me before I get in trouble."
00:21:04.012,00:21:05.389,Thank you for helping me.
00:21:05.472,00:21:09.977,-Get the fuck out of here. Go! No! Why? -Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
00:21:10.602,00:21:12.938,God bless you! You're an accomplice to my shit!
00:21:14.147,00:21:15.816,Whoo!
00:21:15.899,00:21:16.942,I'm free!
00:21:23.448,00:21:25.993,My sister's crazy. I've told you that a million times.
00:21:26.576,00:21:28.578,She doesn't have a regular girl hand.
00:21:28.662,00:21:31.915,I once seen her fry some fish with her bare hand.
00:21:31.999,00:21:37.713,"She grabbed the fish out the batter, put it in the frying pan, set it there till it was done. That's insane."
00:21:37.796,00:21:40.007,I've seen her flip barbecue ribs.
00:21:40.090,00:21:41.258,No spatula.
00:21:41.341,00:21:42.217,Hand.
00:21:43.010,00:21:43.844,God.
00:21:45.637,00:21:47.806,Pressing the meat. Bare hand.
00:21:48.807,00:21:51.727,I don't think I want to eat at your house anymore.
00:21:58.066,00:21:59.568,-How you doing? -Good. Good.
00:21:59.651,00:22:03.905,"Hey, hey. Um… -I'm really excited to get my car. -Uh-huh."
00:22:03.989,00:22:05.282,"Uh, it's under Malone."
00:22:06.158,00:22:08.327,"Pink Crown Vic, Crown Victoria."
00:22:08.410,00:22:10.120,"Oh, someone just picked that up."
00:22:10.203,00:22:11.079,What?
00:22:11.621,00:22:13.874,Bud Mal-- Bud Malone just picked that up.
00:22:16.251,00:22:17.544,Bud picked up my car.
00:22:18.295,00:22:19.629,Was he with somebody?
00:22:19.713,00:22:21.965,-Yep. Yep. -What did he look like?
00:22:22.674,00:22:24.301,"Uh, they were African American."
00:22:24.926,00:22:27.888,-Do you know where they were going? -I think they said New York.
00:22:27.971,00:22:29.264,-New York? -Yeah.
00:22:30.390,00:22:36.730,"Their name was on the card, so… What's your name, man?"
00:22:37.564,00:22:38.398,Bob.
00:22:38.482,00:22:42.319,"Bob, I ain't trying to go back to jail for killing nobody, but I'm about to kill somebody, Bob."
00:22:43.904,00:22:46.573,You gave 'em my car. Now they got to die.
00:22:55.832,00:22:56.875,Okay.
00:23:03.965,00:23:06.551,"Dude, check it out. I got a Chinese finger trap, man."
00:23:06.635,00:23:08.804,It'll be like our good luck charm on the road.
00:23:08.887,00:23:13.308,How about this? I'll ask one of these fellow Americans where a cool bar is.
00:23:14.101,00:23:17.562,"-Celebrate, first road trip. -All right, whatever you say. I'm down."
00:23:17.646,00:23:19.898,"Excuse me, sir. Is there a bar around here?"
00:23:19.981,00:23:22.109,Me and my friend want to party tonight.
00:23:22.192,00:23:25.195,"-We're going to Electric Cowboy tonight. -Oh, really? Oh, thanks, man."
00:23:25.278,00:23:27.531,"-You wanna turn around, I'll hold it. -Oh, really?"
00:23:32.953,00:23:34.788,Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!
00:23:36.498,00:23:39.376,"Just get away, bro! Get away from it!"
00:23:39.459,00:23:42.337,Somebody just turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off!
00:23:42.421,00:23:43.630,"Hello, where's the shutoff?"
00:23:43.713,00:23:45.465,God! I swallowed some of it.
00:23:48.385,00:23:50.971,"-Where's the shutoff? -Here, here, here, hold this."
00:23:51.054,00:23:53.473,"No, I'm not touching that shit. Get away from it, bro."
00:23:53.557,00:23:54.808,Let's just get out of here.
00:24:08.780,00:24:11.074,"I'm going to do vanilla, but I'd love some bacon."
00:24:11.158,00:24:13.034,-Bacon? Sure. -Great.
00:24:15.745,00:24:16.830,-Yeah. -Yeah.
00:24:16.913,00:24:19.499,You seen these dudes right here? They stole my car.
00:24:19.583,00:24:21.334,"-Ah, man. -That's my car right there."
00:24:21.418,00:24:23.295,"-That's my Bad Bitch. -Sorry. No, I don't."
00:24:26.590,00:24:28.675,They're all here. They love donuts.
00:24:35.557,00:24:36.975,Have you seen this car?
00:24:39.102,00:24:40.228,This is my car.
00:24:40.312,00:24:43.648,My grandma gave me that car for my 16th birthday.
00:24:44.316,00:24:47.027,"I just got out of jail, and these dudes I know stole my car."
00:24:47.110,00:24:49.196,-Where do you stay at? -Where do I stay at?
00:24:49.279,00:24:50.739,"I stay in the Avenues, man."
00:24:50.822,00:24:53.658,Okay. You gotta go down to the precinct.
00:24:53.742,00:24:54.826,"Man, you are handsome."
00:24:54.910,00:24:55.744,Huh?
00:24:55.827,00:24:57.954,-You are so handsome. -Thank you.
00:24:58.038,00:25:03.168,"Yeah, you gotta-- you gotta go to, um… you gotta go to the, uh, zone four precinct."
00:25:03.877,00:25:07.964,"Man, it's been so long since a man looked me in my eyes."
00:25:08.590,00:25:09.424,You are beautiful.
00:25:09.508,00:25:11.468,Thank you. You gotta go to the zone four precinct.
00:25:11.551,00:25:12.719,-Can we kiss? -No.
00:25:13.929,00:25:16.181,It's been so long since I kissed a man.
00:25:16.264,00:25:18.892,"What's your name, Officer? Can I get your number?"
00:25:18.975,00:25:20.185,"No, I'm married."
00:25:20.727,00:25:23.730,So? You a police. Y'all don't care about shit like that.
00:25:23.813,00:25:24.814,I do.
00:25:29.236,00:25:32.948,"Hey, hey, hey. Excuse me. Y'all been out here eating donuts and stuff."
00:25:33.031,00:25:35.700,Have you seen these guys? Have you seen these two dudes?
00:25:35.784,00:25:36.993,They stole my car.
00:25:38.745,00:25:41.540,They ain't trying to holler at me. They're not helping at all.
00:25:41.623,00:25:48.296,"-Oh, wow. -That's what I'm saying, like-- -Say yes to it. -Yes! Say yes to it!"
00:25:48.380,00:25:51.007,You know what? Sometimes you just gotta do it yourself.
00:25:52.926,00:25:55.345,Fuck the police. I'm gonna kill these motherfuckers!
00:25:59.766,00:26:00.892,Holy shit!
00:26:15.865,00:26:16.700,Damn it!
00:26:29.254,00:26:30.964,"Hey, White Chicks?"
00:26:32.799,00:26:35.176,"That's my favorite movie right there, man."
00:26:35.260,00:26:40.557,"You know something? The first time I saw that movie, halfway through, I really thought they were white women."
00:26:41.224,00:26:43.560,"They look like, uh, burn victims."
00:26:43.643,00:26:45.895,You're stupid. You don't know anything about good cinema.
00:26:45.979,00:26:48.607,"More like, God, them some thick-ass white girls."
00:26:48.690,00:26:51.359,"Fat-ass booties. I'm like, They got Black girl booties."
00:26:53.737,00:26:55.947,Terry Crews was convinced. You saw the movie.
00:27:02.621,00:27:05.165,"Look at this place, man. Fuck, yes!"
00:27:11.546,00:27:12.547,Yo.
00:27:12.631,00:27:16.760,"-Chris, I don't know about this, man. -Dude, trust me. It's gonna rock."
00:27:17.719,00:27:18.762,Whoo!
00:27:39.282,00:27:40.450,"USA, baby!"
00:27:43.203,00:27:45.121,I don't see race. Didn't even notice.
00:27:45.205,00:27:47.749,You know what race I see? The American race.
00:27:48.458,00:27:50.293,It's right out on that dance floor.
00:28:03.264,00:28:05.100,"Bud, this is awesome!"
00:28:05.767,00:28:07.143,Get your ass over here!
00:28:13.692,00:28:15.276,"Let's get some shots, huh?"
00:28:16.277,00:28:17.862,First night of the road trip.
00:28:18.655,00:28:21.700,Couldn't have asked for a better partner on the road.
00:28:25.620,00:28:29.040,Let me-- Let me buy you a round. Let me buy you a round and some shots.
00:28:29.624,00:28:32.460,"Yeah, this is my best friend, Bud. He's a little shy."
00:28:32.544,00:28:34.421,"Cheers! Pick it up, cheers!"
00:28:34.504,00:28:36.172,"Here's to you, Bud Malone!"
00:28:41.720,00:28:43.388,"This should be it, okay?"
00:28:44.180,00:28:45.724,Give me one more shot.
00:28:49.144,00:28:50.478,"Ah, damn dude."
00:28:50.562,00:28:51.396,I guess I do.
00:28:59.320,00:29:01.406,I would suggest you not to do that.
00:29:01.489,00:29:03.199,Did he just drink outta that thing?
00:29:11.833,00:29:13.334,What's wrong with him?
00:29:13.418,00:29:15.378,He's just so wound up. He's so uptight.
00:29:15.462,00:29:17.255,"I dunno, like, can we pray for him?"
00:29:17.338,00:29:19.174,Do you mind praying for him real quick?
00:29:19.257,00:29:24.637,"I'm not-- Dear-- Dear Jesus, who art in heaven, Father be thy name."
00:29:25.388,00:29:26.973,Thy kingdom come.
00:29:27.056,00:29:30.685,I hope Bud has an amazing time on this road trip.
00:29:30.769,00:29:38.777,"I hope I get to Maria, and fall in love, and make love and have sex with her without a condom."
00:29:38.860,00:29:47.494,"And like, of course I'll make her come first, and then I'm kind of free to, like… you know, jizz whenever I want to."
00:29:47.577,00:29:53.500,"You know, I wanna make her come first, but then I'll jizz whenever I want to, so… -Amen. -Amen."
00:29:55.960,00:29:56.961,I'll be right back.
00:29:58.880,00:30:01.299,"Uh, excuse me, where's the bathroom?"
00:30:03.718,00:30:06.513,How much did you drink? Are you a fucking camel?
00:30:25.865,00:30:29.953,"I'd like to make a toast to my best friend, Bud Malone!"
00:30:30.036,00:30:32.205,What the fuck are you doing up there? Get down!
00:30:32.288,00:30:36.000,"Okay, he's a little nervous. We're the only Black guys in here."
00:30:45.677,00:30:47.345,-Shit. You okay? -Get him out of there.
00:30:48.596,00:30:51.015,"-Is he all right? -Come on, come on, get up, get up."
00:30:59.691,00:31:01.943,-I'm fine. -Do you have a water bottle or a cup?
00:31:13.955,00:31:16.624,"Okay, I'm serious about calling this guy an ambulance."
00:31:16.708,00:31:18.668,He's not okay if he's puking like that.
00:31:18.751,00:31:22.213,Somebody needs to get me a fucking drink and chill out.
00:31:23.214,00:31:24.340,Here's your drink.
00:31:40.940,00:31:43.318,"What the fuck is wrong with you? Like, seriously."
00:31:43.401,00:31:45.486,I wanted to cel-- celebrate you.
00:31:46.946,00:31:49.574,It was a celebration of you and your life.
00:31:51.701,00:31:53.870,I don't know. Thank you for talking me into this.
00:31:54.454,00:31:56.748,It felt good to be out. I needed it.
00:32:01.461,00:32:03.796,We should probably get some rest or wash up.
00:32:27.195,00:32:28.571,"Goodnight, Bud."
00:32:33.493,00:32:35.161,Goddamn. What type of light is this?
00:32:36.579,00:32:37.413,What the fuck?
00:32:39.540,00:32:41.125,One day closer to Maria.
00:33:15.159,00:33:17.537,The price of art is skyrocketing.
00:33:17.620,00:33:21.916,"This is the first one that I wanted to show, because it's the one there's a lot of debate about."
00:33:22.000,00:33:24.544,"I was thinking it looked like a Lord of the Rings, uh, thing."
00:33:24.627,00:33:27.964,It kind of looks like a… a relic.
00:33:34.220,00:33:35.304,Chris?
00:33:35.388,00:33:36.681,"Oh God, yes!"
00:33:36.764,00:33:38.349,"Yes, Chris, yes!"
00:33:50.278,00:33:52.071,"Wow, babe, this is awesome."
00:33:53.114,00:33:54.866,We're doing some free sampling.
00:33:54.949,00:33:58.703,"Wow. Let's get, like, three of those and maybe some bread."
00:33:58.786,00:34:00.288,"Yeah, you're looking good, babes."
00:34:02.415,00:34:04.083,-You talking to my girl? -I got this.
00:34:04.167,00:34:05.126,-That's your girl? -Yeah.
00:34:05.209,00:34:06.294,-Sorry about that. -You sure?
00:34:06.377,00:34:08.087,-You all right? -Yeah. Come on!
00:34:08.171,00:34:10.548,You like hitting on women in farmer's markets?
00:34:13.092,00:34:15.928,What the fuck are you doing? You're fucking hitting on me here?
00:34:20.141,00:34:21.642,What are you looking at?
00:34:22.101,00:34:22.935,Huh?
00:34:49.253,00:34:51.422,I now pronounce you man and wife.
00:34:52.381,00:34:53.800,You may kiss the bride.
00:35:01.641,00:35:04.852,And you may now… kiss me.
00:35:10.942,00:35:12.193,"Oh, God."
00:35:29.877,00:35:32.088,Whoo. Whoo.
00:35:55.528,00:35:58.489,"Okay, there's no way White Chicks would work in real life, man."
00:35:58.573,00:36:00.616,They look like bleached Ninja Turtles.
00:36:00.700,00:36:03.411,"Matter of fact, this lady right here could be a brother."
00:36:05.037,00:36:06.372,"-Excuse me, miss. -Yes."
00:36:07.123,00:36:08.374,Are you a Black man?
00:36:09.083,00:36:10.084,No.
00:36:10.918,00:36:13.087,-Case in point. -Why'd you ask somebody that?
00:36:13.171,00:36:14.881,You said that it could work.
00:36:14.964,00:36:16.132,You look frightening.
00:36:16.215,00:36:17.592,"Wait a minute, what is this?"
00:36:21.387,00:36:22.638,"We gotta do this, bruh."
00:36:22.722,00:36:23.973,"I think we got time, right?"
00:36:24.056,00:36:26.267,Yeah. More than halfway there. We're making great time.
00:36:26.350,00:36:28.436,"-Thank you, ma'am. -No problem."
00:36:28.519,00:36:29.478,Or Black sir.
00:36:44.994,00:36:46.996,"-This makes me happy. -You're having fun, aren't you?"
00:36:47.079,00:36:48.915,I'm having fun. Look at that fancy cat.
00:36:52.210,00:36:53.294,-Booyah. -Booyah.
00:37:01.969,00:37:04.055,and our large primate area.
00:37:04.138,00:37:08.142,"Do me a favor, everybody, uh, keep just a little bit of room off here."
00:37:08.226,00:37:09.644,"Okay, come on in."
00:37:11.103,00:37:12.855,"Oh, I like the Silverback."
00:37:14.398,00:37:15.233,Hey!
00:37:17.735,00:37:19.987,"Guys, this is Jessie. Everybody say hi to Jessie."
00:37:20.071,00:37:23.282,-Dude. Gorilla. -Jessie is our main wolf trainer here.
00:37:28.788,00:37:30.498,-Gonna get a selfie with a gorilla. -No!
00:37:30.581,00:37:31.415,Yes! For Maria.
00:37:31.499,00:37:32.875,"-No. -Come on, it'll melt her heart!"
00:37:32.959,00:37:34.168,-Are you crazy? -No.
00:37:34.919,00:37:37.129,"-Come back here! -Shut up, don't wake him up."
00:37:37.213,00:37:38.798,-The fuck are you doing? -Keep it down.
00:37:42.009,00:37:42.927,Come back here!
00:37:50.977,00:37:53.604,and he is our primary ambassador wolf over here.
00:37:53.688,00:37:56.023,"And Gideon is really, really good at jumping."
00:38:15.042,00:38:17.420,"Wait! Be quiet, be quiet!"
00:38:20.798,00:38:21.882,I'm so scared.
00:38:28.180,00:38:29.348,"Bud, help me!"
00:38:40.860,00:38:42.153,He's a human being!
00:38:44.322,00:38:45.531,-What's his name? -Chris.
00:38:45.614,00:38:46.657,"Chris, come on!"
00:38:52.121,00:38:53.039,Just stay calm!
00:38:54.498,00:38:55.624,Go back in.
00:38:58.085,00:39:02.214,"Please, Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!"
00:39:05.718,00:39:07.053,Why did you go in there?
00:39:07.136,00:39:08.846,The rest of us have kids!
00:39:08.929,00:39:10.389,I wanted to take a picture.
00:39:10.473,00:39:13.434,You wanted to take a picture of the gorilla face-to-face?
00:39:13.517,00:39:15.853,"-Yeah, for this girl. -Would she go in there for you?"
00:39:16.854,00:39:19.106,"Exactly, so why you going in there for her?"
00:39:19.190,00:39:21.067,I'm trying to get her to be my girlfriend.
00:39:21.150,00:39:22.568,-She's not your girlfriend yet? -No.
00:39:22.651,00:39:24.737,I gotta get my cellphone!
00:39:26.197,00:39:27.323,"Sir, you can't go in there!"
00:39:27.406,00:39:29.450,"That damn thing come back, you gonna be through!"
00:39:30.034,00:39:31.160,"Oh, here it is!"
00:39:46.425,00:39:47.259,Bud.

00:39:58.187,00:40:00.189,This my brother Bud and his friend Chris.
00:40:00.272,00:40:02.108,These two don't look familiar to you at all?
00:40:02.691,00:40:04.527,"-No, what-- -You sure you don't know them?"
00:40:04.610,00:40:07.655,I'm pretty sure I don't know them. We gotta walk.
00:40:07.738,00:40:09.907,"-This ain't you, man? -No, it ain't."
00:40:09.990,00:40:12.034,-Your name ain't Craig? -Yeah.
00:40:12.118,00:40:15.287,Are you telling me you don't know them? You up here lying to my face?
00:40:15.371,00:40:20.251,"This is you and them! You, Bud, Chris… Craig."

00:40:25.297,00:40:28.259,"-It is, and I don't know-- -Where is these dudes at?"
00:40:28.759,00:40:30.010,I don't know where they're at.
00:40:30.094,00:40:33.139,"The next time you see these motherfuckers, let 'em know I'm gonna kill they ass."
00:40:33.222,00:40:35.474,"I ain't got your car, and stop yelling at me!"
00:40:35.558,00:40:37.643,"No, you know where my car at, Craig."
00:40:37.726,00:40:40.396,Seen your ass on Facebook and everything with them.
00:40:40.479,00:40:42.731,-What the fuck? -Where's my car at?
00:40:42.815,00:40:45.651,"-Ask your fucking brother! -Well, tell me where my brother is!"
00:40:45.734,00:40:47.403,And why the fuck would I know that?

00:40:49.864,00:40:51.657,I just want you to tell me where my car is.
00:40:51.740,00:40:53.576,"If I knew where your car fucking was, I would."
00:40:53.659,00:40:55.161,"-Would you? -Yes, I would."
00:40:55.244,00:40:56.954,"-Would you really? -Yes, I would."
00:40:57.037,00:41:00.833,'Cause I feel like you're lying to me. I feel like you're a motherfucking liar!
00:41:08.883,00:41:10.593,I got that gorilla cum taste in my mouth.
00:41:10.676,00:41:11.927,Ugh.
00:41:12.011,00:41:13.262,Has Trina got any mints?
00:41:13.345,00:41:15.890,"Hey, don't be going around digging in the car like that. Okay?"
00:41:15.973,00:41:18.100,"Dude, she's got a ton of mints in here. This is great."
00:41:18.809,00:41:21.228,"What? What? If you gonna have a mint, I want a mint."
00:41:23.355,00:41:30.362,"You need it more than me. Your breath is so bad, Oh, okay. Your breath smells like Steve Harvey's mustache."
00:41:31.363,00:41:36.952,"I don't even know what that smells like, but… You're very funny, man."
00:41:37.578,00:41:39.830,"You're, like, way funny tonight."
00:41:45.336,00:41:47.004,"Yeah, I'm boiling."
00:42:34.426,00:42:38.305,"Sir, if you carry on doing that, I will turn around and punch you in your goddamn face."
00:42:47.106,00:42:48.440,"Maria, where'd you go?"
00:42:52.278,00:42:54.780,I look perfectly normal.
00:42:54.863,00:42:56.115,I look great.
00:42:56.198,00:42:57.825,"Yeah, motherfuckers, try to find me now."
00:43:03.998,00:43:06.000,"La-la-la, la-la-la!"
00:43:10.129,00:43:11.171,Oh my God.

00:43:24.018,00:43:25.311,-Are you Maria? -No.
00:43:25.978,00:43:27.062,-You-- -My name is Will.

00:43:51.003,00:43:52.254,Where are we?
00:43:54.048,00:43:55.799,"Fuck, I got a headache, man."
00:43:55.883,00:43:57.384,What happened last night?
00:44:00.971,00:44:02.181,I really gotta pee.
00:44:02.890,00:44:03.974,Ugh!
00:44:05.309,00:44:06.268,Ow!
00:44:11.857,00:44:14.818,Why are our dicks in a Chinese finger trap?
00:44:14.902,00:44:17.363,-What did you do to us? -I didn't do anything to anybody.
00:44:17.446,00:44:18.656,I don't remember a thing.
00:44:18.739,00:44:20.449,I wouldn't put my dick connected to your dick.
00:44:20.532,00:44:22.034,-Maybe if-- -Get your hands off my dick!
00:44:22.117,00:44:23.494,"Sorry, just get up, get up."
00:44:32.836,00:44:34.755,"Look, there's a golfer over there."
00:44:34.838,00:44:37.758,-We can ask him to get us out of this. -He's not gonna fuckin' help us.

00:59:01.704,00:59:03.248,What wars are going on now?
00:59:03.331,00:59:04.207,-What wars? -Yeah.
00:59:04.290,00:59:06.626,"We still got conflict in, of course, the Middle East."
00:59:07.460,00:59:12.423,I just want to go over there because… I just wanna die.
00:59:13.841,00:59:17.178,-What's going on to make you say that? -I lost my best friend.
00:59:17.262,00:59:20.181,We got in a huge falling-out kind of fight.
00:59:21.474,00:59:27.522,"I'll go over to Afghanistan or Iraq, stand on the front lines, and then just bombs away."
00:59:27.605,00:59:31.192,"I understand you're going through a hard time, but that's strong words saying you wanna die."
00:59:31.276,00:59:35.947,"I'll go to Vietnam or whatever, and I'll just get shot by everybody."
00:59:36.030,00:59:37.657,I'll suck your dick if you kill me.
00:59:40.910,00:59:41.744,Get it together.
00:59:41.828,00:59:44.831,Right now you're acting like a danger to yourself and to others.
00:59:52.630,00:59:54.340,"You're okay, all right?"
00:59:55.008,01:00:01.514,"Look, you're in a bad place right now. You've talked to me for five minutes, and you offered to suck my dick to kill you."
01:00:01.598,01:00:03.182,-Yeah. -You know that's not right.
01:00:03.266,01:00:04.934,"-Right. -I get it, bro."
01:00:05.018,01:00:06.853,-I've been in a bad place before. -Yeah.
01:00:06.936,01:00:08.980,"-You know, everybody has. -Yeah."
01:00:09.063,01:00:10.648,You just gotta get it together.
01:00:10.732,01:00:13.109,"Talk to your buddy, apologize, and you'll be fine."
01:00:13.192,01:00:16.112,"-Tell him how you feel, that you're sorry. -Yeah."
01:00:16.195,01:00:21.075,"If he's really your friend, if you guys have been friends for as long as you have, he's gonna forgive you."
01:00:21.159,01:00:22.118,Yeah! God!
01:00:22.744,01:00:23.786,Dude!
01:00:28.833,01:00:31.085,"I was kinda, like, out of it, man!"
01:00:31.169,01:00:34.047,"Really, you brought me back. You brought me back."
01:00:34.631,01:00:37.383,"-Sir, I salute you. -You too, sir."
01:00:37.467,01:00:38.676,And I salute your shorts.
01:00:40.136,01:00:44.098,"-Have a good day. -Yeah! I'm gonna-- Oh, you know what? The bus is leaving soon."
01:00:44.182,01:00:46.267,-Gotta go. -I should go. Thank you! Thank you!
01:01:22.387,01:01:37.527,"Stop the-- Oh my God. I'm so sorry, thank you!"
01:01:37.610,01:01:40.196,"Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, I'm sorry."
01:01:41.030,01:01:43.950,I need to talk to my best friend. I can't let you guys go any further.
01:01:48.037,01:01:48.871,Please.
01:01:49.872,01:01:52.291,"For the first time in my life, let me apologize."
01:01:52.375,01:01:55.420,"I am so, so, sorry, man. I'm shit."
01:01:55.503,01:01:57.380,I realized I'm shit. I'm an asshole.
01:01:57.463,01:01:59.132,"-Okay. -Miss, I'm an asshole."
01:01:59.215,01:02:01.968,I suck shit out of assholes.
01:02:02.051,01:02:04.178,That's what I am. I'm lower than that.
01:02:04.262,01:02:05.763,"And I'm sorry, man."
01:02:05.847,01:02:08.349,I'm sorry I destroyed your sister's car.
01:02:08.433,01:02:10.810,I'm sorry I took advantage of you.
01:02:11.310,01:02:25.742,"And I know you probably never wanna talk to me for the rest of your life, but just know that this trip has been the adventure of a lifetime, and I'm so grateful I had you by my side, and you're the best friend a guy could ask for."
01:02:29.078,01:02:40.631,"So you think you could just chase a bus down, bang on the windows, jump on here, and just apologize like that, and I'd just forgive you, and everything's all good? Huh?"
01:02:40.715,01:02:43.259,-I… I don't know. -You thought that was gonna work?
01:02:50.308,01:02:52.769,That's the best thing anybody's ever done for me.
01:02:52.852,01:02:54.937,"Look man, you're my best friend, bro."
01:03:00.109,01:03:03.237,"Look, if you wanna still make this trip to New York, I'm down."
01:03:04.363,01:03:06.699,Don't fuck with me. I'm really vulnerable right now.
01:03:06.783,01:03:08.993,-Are you being serious? -Forget my sister.
01:03:09.076,01:03:10.745,"Yes, you are going to see Maria."
01:03:12.455,01:03:14.373,"New York City, here we come, baby!"
01:03:17.210,01:03:19.629,Yes!
01:03:19.712,01:03:21.589,We're going to New York! Yes!
01:03:21.672,01:03:23.800,Yes! I'm coming for you! Let's go!
01:03:23.883,01:03:26.135,"Can I give you a hug? I love you, man."
01:03:26.219,01:03:27.970,"I don't know you, but I love you, man!"
01:03:28.054,01:03:30.515,Let's go! Take this bus to New York!
01:03:30.598,01:03:32.475,"It, um… No!"
01:03:53.120,01:03:54.038,Wow.
01:03:59.043,01:04:00.086,"We made it, man."
01:04:01.504,01:04:03.923,"Damn it, I left Maria's business card in the car."
01:04:04.006,01:04:05.675,-Seriously? -Damn it.
01:04:05.758,01:04:08.344,"Uh, you know where the galleries are?"
01:04:08.427,01:04:10.221,-That way. -That way? Thank you.
01:04:12.557,01:04:14.976,"Excuse me, do you know where Maria's gallery is?"
01:04:15.560,01:04:18.521,"-I have no idea. -Maria Li? She's, like, half-Chinese."
01:04:18.604,01:04:19.772,I have no idea who that is.
01:04:19.856,01:04:22.775,She's really sweet. She stuck up for me in high school.
01:04:22.859,01:04:26.112,She's probably the hottest girl in New York City. You gotta know who she is.
01:04:26.612,01:04:29.156,"-I don't-- I don't really know, uh-- -You're not from here?"
01:04:38.666,01:04:50.887,"Mm-mm-mm… There it is, right there!"
01:04:55.600,01:05:02.315,"I'm freaking out. I can't feel my throat, and my hands are disconnected from my body-- -Chris, calm-- calm down. Calm down. -Yeah."
01:05:02.398,01:05:05.985,"Look, you gotta trust yourself, okay, man? What you gonna do?"
01:05:06.068,01:05:12.617,"You're gonna go in there, be yourself, talk how you always talk, and she's gonna fall in love with you. You got this. Go get your girl!"
01:05:15.953,01:05:17.163,Believe in yourself!
01:05:17.955,01:05:19.290,Put some ChapStick on.
01:05:20.082,01:05:23.336,"I got this. I got this, I got this, I got this."
01:05:25.171,01:05:26.589,You got your wristband?
01:05:26.672,01:05:28.716,"-No. Uh, wristband? -Yeah."
01:05:28.799,01:05:31.844,-Maria just invited me from Florida. -That's crazy.
01:05:31.928,01:05:33.971,"Don't have a wristband on you, I don't have your name."
01:05:34.055,01:05:35.765,-I don't need a wristband. I just-- -You do.
01:05:35.848,01:05:38.726,You don't know what I've been through to get here. Can't be stopping me.
01:05:39.685,01:05:42.021,You gotta let me in. Please. Please.
01:05:42.855,01:05:44.565,"-No. No. -Please let me in, sir."
01:05:45.232,01:05:47.151,"-Take a walk, sir. -Please. You have to let me in."
01:05:47.234,01:05:49.153,"-You're not on my list, sir. -Okay, okay, okay."
01:05:55.910,01:05:58.120,I think we got off on the wrong foot.
01:05:58.204,01:05:59.789,I just got two dollars.
01:05:59.872,01:06:03.834,"-Go that way. -And, uh… -I got some Lincolns. -Put your money away."
01:06:03.918,01:06:05.711,-Looks like one-- -Pick up your pennies.
01:06:05.795,01:06:10.174,"Two, four-- Man! Chill out, chill out, chill out."
01:06:10.675,01:06:12.802,The woman I love is in there. Do you understand?
01:06:12.885,01:06:13.719,Gonna be all right.
01:06:13.803,01:06:15.346,-Have you ever been in love? -Yeah.
01:06:15.429,01:06:18.432,-So you know what I'm going through. -That's not the way you do it.
01:06:18.516,01:06:20.726,"I sacrificed everything, my job, my money."
01:06:20.810,01:06:23.187,I gave this guy the last two dollars and five cents.
01:06:23.270,01:06:26.023,No. You need to find another way to talk to that lady.
01:06:26.107,01:06:32.154,"I'm telling you, man, from the bottom of my heart, I've been waiting since I was a kid to tell her how I feel."
01:06:32.822,01:06:36.033,"So if you've ever been in love, you will let me through that door."
01:06:41.038,01:06:42.081,You're letting me in?
01:06:47.086,01:06:49.880,"This is amazing, man! I owe you my life, dude!"
01:06:49.964,01:06:50.798,Go inside.
01:06:52.174,01:06:53.009,Wow.
01:07:10.943,01:07:14.196,We wanna let you know there's an artist speaking at 3:45.
01:07:14.280,01:07:15.114,-Okay. -Okay.
01:07:15.197,01:07:17.742,"-If you're able to stay, that'd be great. -Awesome."
01:07:17.825,01:07:23.497,"Yeah. Five, six, seven, eight… Thank you guys so much for coming today. This is our second group show."
01:07:24.081,01:07:29.545,"Some of these artists sell at auction for millions of dollars, so we're very excited to have their work here today."
01:07:29.628,01:07:38.387,"We really wanna hear what you guys think about this particular collection of artists and of course Anthony's work, which is unbelievable."
01:07:44.018,01:07:46.270,"…you can't speak, 'cause you know some of my work."
01:07:46.771,01:07:50.149,"Well, I think it's a-- -Hi! -Hey, Maria."
01:07:50.232,01:07:51.609,-Oh my God. -Sorry.
01:07:52.151,01:07:53.235,-Hi. -Hi.
01:07:53.319,01:07:55.196,-What are you doing here? -How are you doing?
01:07:55.279,01:07:57.907,-Do you wanna just talk for a second? -Yeah.
01:07:57.990,01:08:02.620,"Sorry, guys. Anthony is-- He can tell you all about his-- his experience."
01:08:05.206,01:08:07.124,This is such a nice surprise.
01:08:08.667,01:08:14.965,"Maria, I, um… I don't quite know the words to use right now."
01:08:15.049,01:08:18.427,Uh… So I'm just gonna speak from the heart.
01:08:18.969,01:08:19.804,Okay.
01:08:20.638,01:08:30.981,"Maria, when you walked in my work the other day, I felt something special, and I knew right then and there that I would stop at nothing to be able to see you again."
01:08:31.065,01:08:35.569,"And, uh… trust me, this trip was not easy."
01:08:35.653,01:08:37.780,I went through hell and high water to get here.
01:08:37.863,01:08:43.661,I experienced emotional and physical traumas I may… never recover from.
01:08:43.744,01:08:57.842,"But I would do it a million times over just to be able to tell you… Maria Li, I am crazy about you, and I want to start a new life with you."
01:09:00.386,01:09:01.554,Chris!
01:09:01.637,01:09:02.680,Oh my God.
01:09:03.430,01:09:07.143,That is… -Thank you… -Yeah.
01:09:07.226,01:09:08.060,…for that.
01:09:11.480,01:09:12.606,No.
01:09:13.899,01:09:16.318,That's… That's crazy.
01:09:18.487,01:09:24.618,"This is just kind of out of left-field, and I'm at work, and-- -Yeah. -We don't really know each other."
01:09:25.161,01:09:29.248,"Listen, is it okay if-- if-- if we're just friends?"
01:09:41.218,01:09:42.094,Oh my God.
01:09:43.888,01:09:44.972,Motherfucker.
01:09:46.932,01:09:48.642,"-Hey, Trina, whoa! -Piece of shit!"
01:10:25.346,01:10:26.222,"Oh, fuck!"
01:10:26.931,01:10:28.015,"Shit! Shit, shit, shit!"
01:10:29.391,01:10:30.476,"Shit, shit, shit, shit."
01:10:35.439,01:10:37.566,"Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Oh!"
01:10:37.650,01:10:39.235,"No, no, no! No, no!"
01:10:39.318,01:10:41.737,"Oh, look… -Where's Bud? -Trina!"
01:10:41.820,01:10:43.948,You destroyed my car. Now I'm gonna destroy you!
01:11:03.717,01:11:06.512,The fuck y'all looking at? Mind your goddamn business!
01:11:06.595,01:11:09.431,"Oh my God, somebody needs to help him!"
01:11:09.515,01:11:11.100,How can I help him?
01:11:15.646,01:11:18.857,"-Talk her out of killing me! -No, I'm gonna let your bitchass go!"
01:11:22.403,01:11:25.656,Help me! The cops won't get here in time!
01:11:25.739,01:11:27.658,What the hell you do to her?
01:11:27.741,01:11:30.494,You better scale your ass back up that wall!
01:11:31.870,01:11:33.330,That nigga ain't worth it!
01:11:33.414,01:11:36.041,-I'm from where you from. -You ain't from where I'm from.
01:11:36.125,01:11:38.585,-Beating his ass ain't worth it! -I'm from the streets!
01:11:38.669,01:11:41.505,"If you was from the street, you wouldn't be doing that!"
01:11:41.588,01:11:44.300,People from the street don't hang people from roofs.
01:11:44.383,01:11:47.636,Can somebody else chime in too and give advice?
01:11:47.720,01:11:52.266,"No, don't-- don't let it happen. I know you got children, you got a family that loves you."
01:11:54.059,01:11:55.728,"You got a family that loves you, though."
01:11:55.811,01:11:58.397,My family don't love me. My family stole my shit.
01:11:58.480,01:12:00.399,There's somebody that loves you.
01:12:00.983,01:12:03.444,You better pray for this nigga 'cause I'm about to drop his ass.
01:12:04.028,01:12:07.448,"Lord, help us, help us right now. Lord help us. Please, Jesus, help us."
01:12:11.744,01:12:12.953,Bud! Is that you?
01:12:16.915,01:12:19.251,-What the fuck did you just say to me? -You heard me.
01:12:21.128,01:12:22.546,Bud's my brother.
01:12:26.133,01:12:28.969,Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus.
01:12:29.845,01:12:31.513,"What, you got some courage today?"
01:12:32.181,01:12:34.099,You looking at a new Bud Malone.
01:12:34.183,01:12:36.185,"That's right, this trip made me better!"
01:12:36.268,01:12:39.146,Bud Malone ain't scared of shit no more.
01:12:39.897,01:12:41.482,"Well, you smell like shit!"
01:12:41.982,01:12:43.275,That may be true.
01:12:44.193,01:12:49.490,"That's for a lot of reasons I don't feel like talking about now, but goddammit, I'm not scared of you."
01:12:51.992,01:12:53.660,You gonna die today.
01:12:53.744,01:12:55.829,"Go and say hi to Grandma, motherfucker."
01:12:55.913,01:12:57.081,I'm gonna live!
01:12:58.374,01:13:01.210,"You've bullied me, you've picked on me, and I'm done with it."
01:13:01.293,01:13:03.962,"You might be saying hi to Grandma, and not me."
01:13:04.046,01:13:05.464,-What? -That's right!
01:13:05.547,01:13:08.133,-You think you gonna fuck me up? -I'm gonna try!
01:13:08.217,01:13:09.676,"-Really, bitch? -Really!"
01:13:09.760,01:13:11.637,-Okay then. -Okay then.
01:13:11.720,01:13:12.805,Let's go.
01:13:15.599,01:13:17.935,"Give me some love, nigga. I'm so proud of you!"
01:13:18.769,01:13:20.479,I am proud of you.
01:13:20.562,01:13:25.150,You been acting like a bitch for years! You finally stood up for yourself.
01:13:25.943,01:13:28.320,"I know I was hard on you growing you up, you know?"
01:13:28.404,01:13:30.155,It was hard for me to grow you.
01:13:30.864,01:13:33.534,"But that's only 'cause I didn't want you to be no punk, man."
01:13:33.617,01:13:35.035,Look at you.
01:13:35.119,01:13:36.203,It fucking worked.
01:13:37.621,01:13:38.872,I guess it did.
01:13:41.625,01:13:44.044,"-Look at me, I'm a tough guy. -You a tough guy now."
01:13:44.128,01:13:46.588,-I stood up to you. That's crazy. -You stood up to me.
01:13:46.672,01:13:48.298,"-And I forgive you, man. -Thank you."
01:13:48.382,01:13:49.675,I didn't think you would.
01:13:53.011,01:13:54.763,What the hell was that for?
01:13:54.847,01:13:56.348,You did steal my car.
01:13:58.142,01:13:59.977,"-Yeah, that's fair. -All right, bro."
01:14:00.769,01:14:02.479,"I'm proud of you, man."
01:14:02.563,01:14:04.106,I'm real proud of you.
01:14:08.318,01:14:10.654,I wasn't ready for this. I was ready to eat.
01:14:11.155,01:14:14.450,I wasn't ready to be Samuel L. Jackson in The Negotiator.
01:14:21.790,01:14:22.749,"Hey, Maria."
01:14:23.542,01:14:28.297,"I realize, in hindsight, this was all a little crazy."
01:14:28.964,01:14:34.636,"And I was bummed out 'cause I thought we were soul mates, but it turns out that I do have a soul mate."
01:14:35.345,01:14:36.722,"My best friend, Bud."
01:14:43.687,01:14:44.938,Get out!
01:14:45.022,01:14:47.149,Look at my gallery!
01:14:47.733,01:14:49.401,Look at what you did!
01:14:55.407,01:14:56.867,"-Nice to meet you. -Yeah, okay."
01:14:56.950,01:14:58.952,-Get the fuck out! -All right.
01:15:07.753,01:15:08.962,Thank you.
01:15:09.796,01:15:11.048,"Cry, that's what you need."
01:15:11.131,01:15:11.965,Thank you.
01:15:12.049,01:15:13.258,"Cry, and it's fine."
01:15:20.224,01:15:22.935,"I'm about to do so much. I'm about to do it big, now. Know what I mean?"
01:15:23.018,01:15:25.854,I'm gonna dress better. Can't keep wearing these big ass jeans.
01:15:28.524,01:15:36.031,"No, honestly, you do so much for me. It's time I do something nice for you, and I think I figured out a way to finally make your dreams come true."
01:16:06.812,01:16:08.605,"My dream finally came true, huh?"
01:16:08.689,01:16:11.108,"-Is this gonna work, though? I mean… -I think, so far so good."
01:16:11.191,01:16:16.196,"Yeah? What do I do? Should I just-- We just gotta have fun, blend in. Change your voice a bit if you can."
01:16:16.280,01:16:17.406,-Okay. -Let's do it.
01:16:17.489,01:16:19.408,-Gonna think white thoughts. -Think white thoughts.
01:16:24.371,01:16:27.749,"Uh, I'm going to yoga and, uh, golf later."
01:16:28.292,01:16:29.126,Yeah?
01:16:29.209,01:16:35.507,"And, uh, I'm gonna go see Megyn Kelly, uh, do a TED Talk later."
01:16:35.591,01:16:36.550,-Cool. -Great.
01:16:37.634,01:16:39.177,"-How you doing? -Good, how are you?"
01:16:39.261,01:16:41.305,I just got my lips done.
01:16:41.388,01:16:43.056,I think you look beautiful tonight.
01:16:50.397,01:16:51.648,"Get your own, okay?"

01:17:16.423,01:17:17.633,Isn't this party fun?
01:17:20.677,01:17:21.887,Mm-hmm.
01:17:22.471,01:17:23.388,"Trina, is that you?"
01:17:24.014,01:17:26.933,"-What up? -Oh! Yeah, Trina!"
01:17:27.017,01:17:33.940,"Since I'm on the run, I figured I might as well go with this look, take it down to Mexico, and start life all over again as a white man."
01:17:34.024,01:17:37.194,"-How's it feel so far, being a white man? -Cooler than a motherfucker."
01:17:37.277,01:17:39.863,I'm living my best motherfucking life. You know what I'm saying?
01:17:39.946,01:17:43.325,I got to walk right in this motherfucker. Didn't nobody stop me from shit.

01:17:45.661,01:17:49.247,Yeah. I'm sick of this boring-ass ballroom dancing bullshit.
01:17:49.331,01:17:50.749,-I'll be back. -Okay.
01:17:50.832,01:17:54.378,-Anybody tell you you look like a turtle? -Whatever.
01:17:59.007,01:18:00.425,"Hey, I need you to leave."
01:18:00.926,01:18:03.261,I need you to get the fuck out of here.
01:18:03.345,01:18:04.846,Cut this music off.
01:18:07.099,01:18:10.018,I said get the fuck off the stage. This is my party.
01:18:10.102,01:18:12.646,"All right, come on, bitches. Let's do this!"

01:19:20.255,01:19:24.301,Are you fucking kidding me? I thought I needed to help somebody!
01:19:25.385,01:19:27.888,See that box right there? There's a camera guy in there.
01:19:27.971,01:19:30.807,"-Your throw up is nasty, man. -Yeah, it's gross."
01:19:30.891,01:19:32.726,"Hey, Adam, Adam. Wave to the people, Adam."
01:19:32.809,01:19:34.102,Wave to them. Say hi.
01:19:35.812,01:19:38.190,You were gonna-- My God!
01:19:38.273,01:19:40.901,"You guys know you wrong for that, seriously."
01:19:40.984,01:19:43.236,"Man, y'all is playing! This the worst!"
01:19:51.828,01:19:53.789,What did you think was up with the vacuum?

01:20:00.879,01:20:02.839,How many fingers can you fit in there?
01:20:03.340,01:20:05.592,-I think we gotta go in the hole-- -Get the fuck out.
01:20:05.675,01:20:07.511,"No, you gotta knot it up and put it in."
01:20:07.594,01:20:09.262,"I trust you, but I do not trust him."
01:20:09.346,01:20:10.472,"Sorry, man."
01:20:12.390,01:20:13.934,"Five second rule, right?"
01:20:14.476,01:20:16.228,What about driving like this?
01:20:23.819,01:20:24.778,And action.
01:20:29.616,01:20:30.700,That was amazing.
01:20:37.707,01:20:38.708,What the fuck?
01:20:46.550,01:20:47.467,What the hell?
01:20:47.551,01:20:50.011,I need my clothes. I'm late for work. Excuse me! Excuse me!
01:20:50.095,01:20:52.305,What the fuck is going on right now?
01:20:52.389,01:20:53.348,Hey!
01:21:03.400,01:21:05.318,"All right, Eric. Let's, uh, test the rig."
01:21:13.493,01:21:16.746,"Oh, God. I thought that was the urinal."
01:21:16.830,01:21:22.586,"I will tell you something right now. I don't care where you piss, but get away from me, okay? 'Cause I don't want to smell your piss."
01:21:22.669,01:21:25.422,I'll shower and play pool with you if you want.
01:21:27.007,01:21:28.341,I guess you don't understand.
01:21:40.020,01:21:43.273,"You got, like, the coolest beard I've ever seen in my life."
01:21:43.356,01:21:45.817,You just look like an artist that never sells his paintings.
01:21:45.901,01:21:46.735,I love it.
01:21:47.485,01:21:50.989,Just keep all that art to yourself. Don't make a dime.
01:21:51.072,01:21:55.285,Your girlfriend left 'cause you don't pay rent because you won't sell any of your pieces.
01:21:55.785,01:21:57.829,That's the beard you've got. You look amazing.
01:21:57.913,01:21:59.372,That's so specific.
01:21:59.456,01:22:02.417,"-Hey, I'm Chris Carey. Nice to meet you. -Hi."
01:22:08.381,01:22:10.342,"-Do you guys wanna hit this? -I do not, thank you."
01:22:22.103,01:22:25.315,"I was thinking somebody was coming after him, and they was gonna come after me."
01:22:25.398,01:22:27.359,"I'm like, Oh, I have to hide under the table."
01:22:30.779,01:22:32.781,"I'm, uh, just a typical white chick."
01:22:37.285,01:22:39.079,"You scared the shit out of me, dude."
01:22:42.874,01:22:45.168,"And Adam, look around to me. Like, whip your head around."
01:22:45.251,01:22:47.253,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great."
01:22:48.213,01:22:55.178,"Yeah, just, like, fuck his face while you're making eye contact. Like… Like, you're just, like… Like, Who's next?"
01:23:02.936,01:23:05.480,I had no idea you all was shooting a movie!
01:23:06.690,01:23:09.609,I ought to beat your butt! Oh my God!
01:23:09.693,01:23:10.944,"Hey, man. You're a hero."
01:23:11.027,01:23:14.364,I was just trying to make sure everything was… You're a goddamned hero.
01:23:15.365,01:23:16.700,"Thanks for doing the movie, buddy."
01:23:16.783,01:23:19.786,They should probably put a towel over this when we ain't filming.
01:23:19.869,01:23:21.162,It's a buddy film.
01:23:31.464,01:23:34.175,But y'all just standing there. Y'all wasn't tryin' to help or nothin'!
01:23:34.259,01:23:50.108,"Y'all scared as hell. Y'all just standing there like… I always wanted to talk to her, you know-- What the fuck!"
01:23:50.942,01:23:51.943,What the fuck!
01:23:52.861,01:23:53.737,What happened?
01:23:55.155,01:23:56.740,What in the fuck happened?
01:23:57.490,01:23:58.450,What did you do?
01:23:58.533,01:23:59.451,"You're naked, man."
01:23:59.534,01:24:00.952,"Hey, Craig!"
01:24:01.036,01:24:02.328,"Selling it, woman!"
01:24:02.412,01:24:04.622,You're selling it!
01:24:04.706,01:24:06.583,That is awesome!
01:24:14.716,01:24:17.927,"I just saw this girl, like, snatch a door off a cop car."
01:24:19.137,01:24:20.972,"And I was wondering, like, She strong!"
01:24:21.973,01:24:24.684,"That's wrong. You better get my good side, too."
01:24:25.310,01:24:28.730,"Did you think I was just, like-- Did you think I was, like, schizophrenic?"
01:24:31.941,01:24:32.776,Three.
01:24:36.488,01:24:37.322,Four.
