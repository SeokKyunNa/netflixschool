00:04:01.533,00:04:02.868,Didn’t mean to.
00:04:04.411,00:04:05.787,You were outside?
00:04:05.871,00:04:08.373,-Why didn’t you wake me? -I wanted to be alone.
00:04:09.249,00:04:12.544,"I mean, I needed to clear my head and get the ideas flowing."
00:04:13.879,00:04:15.088,And did they?
00:04:16.590,00:04:17.549,No.
00:04:18.592,00:04:19.676,They will.
00:04:20.218,00:04:21.344,Don’t worry.
00:04:22.095,00:04:23.263,It’ll come.
00:04:27.601,00:04:30.061,-I must stink. -I like it.
00:04:30.353,00:04:31.563,I better shower.
00:06:31.600,00:06:33.310,-Can I grab these? -I got it.
00:06:48.825,00:06:50.076,Ooh.
00:06:50.577,00:06:51.995,Perfect.
00:06:52.746,00:06:54.205,You didn’t need to do all of this.
00:06:54.289,00:06:55.373,I wanted to.
00:06:55.582,00:06:56.917,You’ve been working so hard.
00:06:57.751,00:06:59.252,Yeah. Right.
00:07:54.891,00:07:56.017,Wait here.
00:08:11.282,00:08:12.826,-Come in. Please. -Thanks. Thanks.
00:08:12.909,00:08:14.661,Oh. Hello.
00:08:16.162,00:08:22.293,"So this gentleman here just started working at the hospital, and he thought we were-- -What do you do there? -I’m an orthopedic surgeon."
00:08:25.463,00:08:26.548,Research.
00:08:26.631,00:08:28.883,"Yes. I know, it’s a bit boring."
00:08:30.969,00:08:33.471,Sit for a second. Can we get you anything to drink?
00:08:33.555,00:08:35.724,No. That isn’t... That’s fine.
00:08:36.725,00:08:38.560,-Some tea? -Hmm?
00:08:38.643,00:08:40.353,"-Some tea? -No, no, no, no, no."
00:08:40.437,00:08:41.855,"Uh, I don’t..."
00:08:41.938,00:08:43.231,Uh...
00:08:45.108,00:08:46.484,But you must.
00:08:46.568,00:08:48.611,"A guest and a doctor? I mean, who knows?"
00:08:48.695,00:08:50.238,I might trip down the stairs one day.
00:08:52.073,00:08:53.533,-I’ll go make some. -Thank you.
00:08:55.493,00:08:56.745,Sorry for the mess.
00:08:56.828,00:08:58.830,We’re moving in after months of construction.
00:09:04.002,00:09:05.462,I thought it was your daughter.
00:09:40.872,00:09:41.873,Fine.
00:10:21.412,00:10:23.414,"this was an opera singer, late 20s."
00:10:23.498,00:10:29.254,Her femurs were rotated so far inward that she couldn’t spread her knees more than a foot apart.
00:10:32.924,00:10:35.135,-Where’d that come from? -I always carry a supply.
00:10:35.218,00:10:36.845,I never tasted something like this.
00:10:36.928,00:10:39.389,It’s hard to come by. I had to share.
00:10:39.472,00:10:40.473,Won’t you join?
00:10:40.557,00:10:42.433,Mmm. She’s not much of a drinker.
00:10:42.809,00:10:43.852,I drink.
00:10:43.935,00:10:45.895,"Here, let me put a little in your tea."
00:10:46.604,00:10:48.439,"I’m fine with tea, thank you."
00:10:51.109,00:10:53.862,The good doctor here is about to publish a major paper.
00:10:55.405,00:10:57.365,I still have reams of research to write up.
00:10:57.448,00:10:59.242,And he’s moved here to finish it.
00:11:00.118,00:11:02.328,And... And what brings you to us?
00:11:02.412,00:11:04.747,"Well, they told me I could find a room here."
00:11:04.831,00:11:06.916,He thought we were a bed and breakfast.
00:11:10.044,00:11:12.422,how this place is too big for the two of us.
00:11:15.592,00:11:20.638,"Well, I really should be going if I’m going to find another-- Nonsense. No, no. No, it’s late. Stay the night."
00:11:22.140,00:11:24.058,"Please. We’d enjoy the company, right?"
00:11:25.810,00:11:27.228,"Yes, of course."
00:11:28.271,00:11:29.772,-Are you sure? -Positive.
00:11:31.191,00:11:33.735,"Well, then I’ll just grab the rest of my stuff."
00:11:33.818,00:11:36.321,That’s incredibly kind and generous.
00:11:38.907,00:11:41.326,-You all right? -I’m fine.
00:11:47.373,00:11:48.625,Thanks.
00:11:49.751,00:11:51.252,We don’t know him.
00:11:51.336,00:11:53.588,-He’s a doctor. -He’s a stranger.
00:11:53.713,00:11:55.298,We’re just gonna let him sleep in our house?
00:11:56.549,00:11:58.301,You want me to ask him to leave?
00:12:02.180,00:12:03.932,-Is that all? -That’s everything.
00:12:05.767,00:12:07.185,"Um, we don’t smoke."
00:12:08.019,00:12:09.187,That’s smart.
00:12:10.521,00:12:12.273,"In the house, I mean."
00:12:12.774,00:12:13.858,Sorry.
00:14:02.383,00:14:05.053,"Oh, and this! I love this."
00:14:05.219,00:14:07.180,How come you have so many copies?
00:14:07.263,00:14:08.431,"Well, I wrote it."
00:14:09.057,00:14:10.558,"Oh, my."
00:14:12.560,00:14:14.854,-I’m a huge fan. -You’ve read it?
00:14:17.065,00:14:18.941,Your words have changed my life.
00:14:20.651,00:14:22.737,"Oh, I’m sorry. You must..."
00:14:22.820,00:14:24.405,You must hear that all the time.
00:14:24.489,00:14:26.074,"Not really, no."
00:14:30.703,00:14:31.913,What is that?
00:14:34.540,00:14:36.876,"This is very, very delicate."
00:14:37.919,00:14:40.088,It was a gift.
00:14:44.258,00:14:45.635,Is it from you?
00:14:49.097,00:14:50.098,No.
00:14:51.599,00:14:54.519,"When I was younger, I lost everything in a fire."
00:14:55.937,00:14:57.897,It’s hard to imagine what that means.
00:14:57.980,00:14:59.273,Losing everything.
00:14:59.357,00:15:02.068,"Your memories, your work, even your dirty toothbrush."
00:15:02.193,00:15:07.532,I didn’t even know if I could ever create again until I found this in the ashes.
00:15:09.242,00:15:10.660,Isn’t that remarkable?
00:15:12.203,00:15:14.497,It gave me the strength to start again.
00:15:15.373,00:15:16.874,And then I met her.
00:15:16.958,00:15:18.042,You.
00:15:18.501,00:15:21.421,And she breathed life back into every room.
00:15:21.504,00:15:23.172,She redid all of it.
00:15:23.881,00:15:25.216,Every last detail.
00:15:26.551,00:15:28.428,-By yourself? -Mmm-hmm.
00:15:28.845,00:15:30.054,Wow.
00:15:30.138,00:15:31.973,So you’re not just a pretty face.
00:15:34.392,00:15:37.603,I just came up to say I’m gonna get ready for bed.
00:15:40.857,00:15:42.442,You okay? Want some water?
00:15:43.025,00:15:44.026,Are you all right?
00:15:49.240,00:15:50.450,I’ll be up soon.
00:15:51.659,00:15:53.369,Sure you don’t want some water?
00:15:53.453,00:15:54.871,Just a little bit.
00:15:54.954,00:15:55.955,Here you go.
00:15:56.998,00:15:58.291,Sit down.
00:16:49.133,00:16:50.718,Is everything all right?
00:16:50.801,00:16:52.887,He drank too much. He’ll be fine.
00:16:55.806,00:16:57.975,-What is... -Give him some privacy.
00:16:59.352,00:17:01.187,"Okay, get it out."
00:17:01.479,00:17:02.772,Just get it all out.
00:18:56.052,00:18:57.219,Smells great.
00:18:57.595,00:18:59.013,What happened last night?
00:18:59.096,00:19:01.057,I couldn’t sleep. I got so excited.
00:19:01.849,00:19:02.975,From what?
00:19:03.100,00:19:04.810,His stories. I love the man’s mind.
00:19:05.603,00:19:10.149,"It is so inspiring, speaking with someone who really appreciates the work."
00:19:11.400,00:19:12.610,I love your work.
00:19:14.111,00:19:16.781,Of course you do. I know that.
00:19:19.700,00:19:21.035,So is he better?
00:19:26.374,00:19:29.001,"-Is he all right? -Fine, fine. One sec."
00:19:38.678,00:19:40.513,"Oh, sorry. Just need a light."
00:19:41.722,00:19:43.724,Don’t worry about it. I’ll take it outside.
00:19:47.520,00:19:49.313,-Morning. -Good morning.
00:19:50.481,00:19:52.149,How are you feeling?
00:19:52.233,00:19:53.275,Wonderful.
00:19:55.861,00:19:57.321,You’re all better?
00:19:57.738,00:19:58.781,Better?
00:20:01.784,00:20:03.828,-How did you sleep? -Like a baby.
00:20:05.121,00:20:07.623,Really vivid dreams. Must be the air.
00:20:13.170,00:20:15.172,"No, don’t. I’ll get it."
00:20:25.766,00:20:27.017,-Hello. -Hello.
00:20:27.143,00:20:28.811,"-Can I help you? -Ah, you made it!"
00:20:29.687,00:20:31.063,My better half.
00:20:39.780,00:20:41.282,Nice to meet you.
00:20:41.907,00:20:44.410,"-Oh, the pleasure is mine. -Well, come in."
00:20:47.955,00:20:49.915,I didn’t realize you were married.
00:20:50.166,00:20:51.208,Really?
00:20:53.127,00:20:54.336,Breakfast!
00:21:06.474,00:21:08.142,"-No, don’t! -Oh!"
00:21:09.727,00:21:11.854,"-Oh, sorry. -I got it!"
00:21:15.900,00:21:17.651,-Are you all right? -I think so.
00:21:17.735,00:21:19.403,You’re okay. Ice.
00:21:19.528,00:21:20.696,Ice!
00:21:26.410,00:21:27.536,Oh.
00:21:31.499,00:21:32.833,It’s very nice to meet you.
00:21:49.892,00:21:52.102,I was getting used to being alone.
00:21:55.397,00:21:57.066,...it just happened for us.
00:21:57.525,00:22:02.571,"I saw her, and I knew she was the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with."
00:22:10.037,00:22:11.622,"You believe me, right?"
00:22:20.464,00:22:23.300,-Did you have any doubts? -No! Not a one.
00:22:23.884,00:22:26.262,"You guys understand that kind of connection, right?"
00:22:27.304,00:22:28.305,You must.
00:22:28.389,00:22:30.099,"I mean, you’re both so different."
00:22:30.182,00:22:32.059,It must have been what pulled you together.
00:22:32.476,00:22:34.061,You’re so beautiful. Come here.
00:22:42.528,00:22:45.072,And then the kids came and screwed it all up.
00:22:57.543,00:22:58.586,And you two?
00:22:59.169,00:23:00.671,You have kids?
00:23:00.754,00:23:02.756,Not yet. But we want them.
00:23:06.969,00:23:08.429,"Well, what are you waiting for?"
00:23:08.512,00:23:10.764,Why not finish breakfast and get to it?
00:23:13.017,00:23:19.940,"Well, I want to finish the house, and he’s working on a new piece."
00:23:20.024,00:23:22.026,"Oh, so you’re writing again?"
00:23:25.696,00:23:26.655,Yes.
00:23:27.364,00:23:28.991,"Oh, no. We’re in the way."
00:23:29.116,00:23:34.580,That’s the last thing in the world-- You’re more than welcome to stay here as long as you want.
00:23:37.041,00:23:38.667,That’s very kind of you.
00:23:40.711,00:23:42.338,"Honey, they’ve got plenty of room."
00:23:42.421,00:23:43.756,"Speaking of kids, do you have a phone?"
00:23:43.839,00:23:45.716,-I can’t get a signal. -That’s how we like it.
00:23:47.468,00:23:49.219,There’s one in the kitchen. I can show you.
00:23:49.303,00:23:50.387,"No, it’s all right."
00:23:55.559,00:23:56.685,Just a quick call.
00:23:59.480,00:24:00.731,What’s wrong?
00:24:01.649,00:24:03.734,Why would you do that without asking me?
00:24:04.693,00:24:07.446,-Do what? -Invite them to stay.
00:24:08.572,00:24:10.532,I didn’t think it was a big deal.
00:24:11.909,00:24:13.953,-It’s strange. -What?
00:24:15.454,00:24:17.081,Did you know he had a wife?
00:24:21.585,00:24:22.962,What about your writing?
00:24:25.631,00:24:29.009,I was actually enjoying not thinking about it.
00:24:30.844,00:24:35.057,"But now that I am thinking about it, I should go and do something about it."
00:24:36.183,00:24:37.351,Hey.
00:24:38.143,00:24:39.353,Hey.
00:24:41.855,00:24:43.273,I really should work.
00:25:23.022,00:25:24.189,Oops. Oh!
00:25:24.273,00:25:25.566,Careful.
00:25:25.899,00:25:27.609,Thought you might like some.
00:25:28.652,00:25:30.070,"Yes, thank you."
00:25:30.571,00:25:32.114,Secret family recipe.
00:25:32.197,00:25:33.866,Which part? The lemons?
00:25:38.120,00:25:39.455,-How’s your hand? -Mmm.
00:25:40.706,00:25:42.958,-Still stinging. -I’m sorry.
00:25:43.417,00:25:44.877,It’s not like it was your fault.
00:25:46.045,00:25:47.880,"You don’t have any painkillers, do you?"
00:25:50.883,00:25:51.967,Are you telling me the truth?
00:25:53.469,00:25:55.304,I really don’t have any. I’m sorry.
00:25:58.057,00:25:59.224,Okay.
00:25:59.558,00:26:00.768,You’re not thirsty?
00:26:01.393,00:26:02.436,Right.
00:26:13.822,00:26:15.032,Now I get it.
00:26:15.741,00:26:17.785,-It’s strong. -I’m on my second.
00:26:18.410,00:26:20.579,I can’t believe you did all this work yourself.
00:26:21.288,00:26:23.040,-Why not? -It’s a lot.
00:26:23.665,00:26:25.793,"Well, we spend all our time here."
00:26:26.710,00:26:28.003,I want to make it paradise.
00:26:30.172,00:26:31.840,And I love the work.
00:26:33.801,00:26:35.219,And it’s exquisite.
00:26:35.552,00:26:36.553,Thank you.
00:26:37.262,00:26:39.139,Would you take me on a tour?
00:26:39.223,00:26:40.390,Sure.
00:26:45.854,00:26:48.023,I want to thank you for your hospitality.
00:26:49.399,00:26:52.945,Your husband has been so generous.
00:26:54.363,00:26:55.614,You’re welcome.
00:26:57.699,00:26:59.952,"Well, where to begin?"
00:27:03.205,00:27:05.624,"Well, this was the hardest part."
00:27:05.707,00:27:09.419,"There was so much damage. The treads were gone, the railing, even the skylight."
00:27:09.586,00:27:14.174,"So I had to get a lot of new material, but I tried to save as much-- Isn’t it a lot harder than just starting fresh?"
00:27:14.258,00:27:15.300,How do you mean?
00:27:16.009,00:27:18.428,Why didn’t you just build a new house?
00:27:19.555,00:27:21.098,"Well, it’s..."
00:27:21.181,00:27:22.516,It’s his home.
00:27:24.017,00:27:25.269,Oh...
00:27:26.270,00:27:27.688,You really love him.
00:27:30.232,00:27:31.733,Can I ask you a question?
00:27:32.985,00:27:34.403,Why don’t you want kids?
00:27:36.488,00:27:37.531,Excuse me?
00:27:40.534,00:27:42.870,I saw how you reacted earlier.
00:27:46.290,00:27:49.418,"and you think you have all the time in the world, and..."
00:27:49.668,00:27:52.379,"You know, you’re not going to be so young forever."
00:27:53.130,00:27:54.214,Have kids.
00:27:55.340,00:27:57.342,Then you’ll be creating something together.
00:27:58.677,00:28:00.387,That’s what keeps a marriage going.
00:28:00.470,00:28:01.847,This... This is all just...
00:28:03.140,00:28:04.141,setting.
00:28:16.320,00:28:18.697,"Oh, you do want them."
00:28:21.408,00:28:22.743,Is it him?
00:28:24.786,00:28:28.457,-I’m gonna get back to work. -Then why did he say...
00:28:29.333,00:28:30.334,I’m sorry.
00:28:31.460,00:28:34.254,Was I too forward? I do that sometimes.
00:28:35.255,00:28:37.466,Every relationship has its issues.
00:28:37.549,00:28:41.011,"And when there’s a full generation between you, I can only imagine."
00:28:42.846,00:28:44.514,Is that where he works?
00:28:44.598,00:28:45.641,That’s private.
00:28:45.724,00:28:47.643,"Oh, can’t you just give me a peek?"
00:28:48.393,00:28:50.812,He doesn’t like anyone being in there without him!
00:28:51.104,00:28:53.857,Wow. You really do love him.
00:28:54.524,00:28:55.901,God help you.
00:28:59.655,00:29:01.406,-I’m gonna take him outside. -We’re going on a hike.
00:29:01.990,00:29:02.991,A hike?
00:29:03.116,00:29:04.701,-Me on a hike! -Just a quick one.
00:29:06.662,00:29:08.914,so my smoke doesn’t burn too quickly.
00:29:08.997,00:29:11.708,"-You don’t want to come? -No, we have laundry to do."
00:29:13.210,00:29:14.670,"You’ll show me where, right?"
00:29:18.590,00:29:20.926,"The boys have bonded, -don’t you think? -Mm-hmm."
00:29:21.009,00:29:23.887,Mine’s not usually such a nature boy.
00:29:23.971,00:29:27.182,Wow. Guess you haven’t quite got to this part yet.
00:29:29.559,00:29:31.061,That’s a lot of tools.
00:29:31.144,00:29:32.312,I’ll get it.
00:29:33.230,00:29:35.232,-Which is which? -On the left.
00:29:41.905,00:29:43.949,"Oh, wait! Let me... I’ll help you."
00:29:47.828,00:29:49.705,"Oh, no. So that’s the problem."
00:29:49.830,00:29:50.747,What?
00:30:01.550,00:30:04.344,you got to keep it interesting.
00:30:05.053,00:30:06.305,He’s not that old.
00:30:07.389,00:30:09.057,How’s it going in that department?
00:30:12.352,00:30:16.273,I don’t feel comfortable talking about that stuff.
00:30:16.356,00:30:18.317,I’m just trying to help.
00:30:19.359,00:30:21.528,"I mean, look at you."
00:30:21.611,00:30:25.407,"If he’s not all over you, it’s either because of his age or..."
00:30:29.077,00:30:30.078,Or what?
00:30:34.207,00:30:35.876,You know what? Forget it.
00:30:36.877,00:30:38.295,It’s none of my business.
00:30:39.796,00:30:41.131,I think this has gone to my head.
00:30:41.214,00:30:42.632,"No, it’s okay. Say what you were gonna say."
00:30:42.716,00:30:45.010,"No, seriously. No, obviously he still loves you."
00:30:49.222,00:30:50.891,I’m gonna freshen these up.
00:31:54.204,00:31:55.372,Hello?
00:32:02.295,00:32:03.630,Hello?
00:32:07.467,00:32:08.718,Hello?
00:33:37.098,00:33:38.391,Hey!
00:33:42.812,00:33:45.607,"I told you, he doesn’t like anyone being in here without him."
00:33:45.690,00:33:47.567,It’s amazing. What is it?
00:33:47.651,00:33:49.027,We really have to leave.
00:33:50.320,00:33:52.322,-Please? -I just want to look at it.
00:34:18.390,00:34:20.225,Come on. Let’s go get you your pills.
00:34:20.892,00:34:23.061,If I wanted a third child...
00:34:23.645,00:34:24.896,I guess you overdid it.
00:34:26.439,00:34:28.191,Whew! That was intense.
00:34:28.316,00:34:30.110,And you're not gonna believe what he just told me.
00:34:30.193,00:34:31.570,That sink’s not braced yet.
00:34:31.987,00:34:32.988,What?
00:34:34.531,00:34:35.532,"Hey, wait."
00:34:35.615,00:34:37.242,Something happened?
00:34:38.076,00:34:39.077,What?
00:34:41.746,00:34:43.748,What is it? What?
00:34:45.166,00:34:47.836,He has one of those pictures of you in his luggage.
00:34:49.004,00:34:50.505,What were you doing in their luggage?
00:34:50.589,00:34:52.007,That’s not the point.
00:34:52.215,00:34:53.967,He didn’t just stumble on us.
00:34:54.050,00:34:56.136,-He’s a crazy fan. -I know.
00:34:57.178,00:34:58.221,Excuse me?
00:34:58.305,00:35:00.682,That’s what he told me on our walk.
00:35:01.266,00:35:02.601,He’s dying.
00:35:06.021,00:35:07.772,That’s why he came here.
00:35:08.106,00:35:10.275,He wanted to meet me before he’s gone.
00:35:11.610,00:35:13.945,"Well, why didn’t he... tell us that?"
00:35:14.070,00:35:16.197,-Why lie? -I don’t know. I don’t know.
00:35:16.281,00:35:17.657,He’s a proud man.
00:35:30.837,00:35:32.172,We’re both sorry.
00:35:32.297,00:35:33.590,I was telling her the story and...
00:35:33.673,00:35:37.677,-It just fell out of my hand. -We’ll search and find you -another one. -We can pay for a new one.
00:36:03.161,00:36:06.665,I’m sorry I screamed. I just need a moment.
00:36:18.426,00:36:20.387,It was an accident.
00:36:20.470,00:36:22.097,I think it’s best if you leave.
00:36:22.681,00:36:24.265,We said we were sorry.
00:36:24.349,00:36:26.810,"-Honey, don’t antagonize her. -Well, what more do you want?"
00:36:26.893,00:36:29.270,"Honey, don't-- Just... It’ll be okay."
00:36:44.035,00:36:45.537,Please.
00:39:20.108,00:39:21.568,What are you doing?
00:39:25.738,00:39:27.657,"Well, don’t worry. I’m kicking them out."
00:39:28.241,00:39:29.993,Yeah. And where will they go?
00:39:46.718,00:39:47.802,Need something?
00:39:50.346,00:39:52.515,-Are you ready? -What do you mean?
00:39:53.766,00:39:55.101,We want you out.
00:39:56.519,00:39:57.937,We? Or you?
00:39:59.022,00:40:02.734,"-I’ve tried very hard-- -Yeah, well, look, I have to check on my husband."
00:40:16.205,00:40:17.415,Where is everybody?
00:40:19.417,00:40:20.585,"Oh, hey."
00:40:21.252,00:40:22.795,"Hey, who are you?"
00:40:22.879,00:40:25.131,Who are you? What are you doing here?
00:40:25.214,00:40:27.133,"What are any of us doing here, right?"
00:40:28.259,00:40:29.260,Where’s my mother?
00:40:31.179,00:40:32.931,"Uh, she’s... Wait here."
00:40:33.806,00:40:35.016,"Hey, nice view."
00:40:38.895,00:40:40.813,-Did you invite your son? -What are you doing here?
00:40:40.897,00:40:42.565,"Mom, I tried calling, but I couldn’t get through."
00:40:43.775,00:40:45.234,He came to the house and found the will.
00:40:45.318,00:40:46.694,"-What? -Yeah, he’s out of control."
00:40:46.778,00:40:54.661,"I’m sorry, but whatever this is, Yeah, ran straight to Mommy."
00:40:54.744,00:40:56.037,You followed me. What’s wrong with you?
00:40:58.206,00:40:59.999,Who is she? Who are you? Who are you?
00:41:00.083,00:41:02.543,-He doesn’t want to see you. -That’s not true. Is he here?
00:41:04.128,00:41:05.338,"Boys, why are you here?"
00:41:05.463,00:41:07.590,What is this? Do you know what you’ve signed?
00:41:09.384,00:41:10.551,You said that you told him.
00:41:10.635,00:41:12.178,"No, honey, I didn’t say that. I was going to."
00:41:12.303,00:41:13.888,You wanted this? How could you?
00:41:15.306,00:41:16.683,-Let me explain to him. -I’ll talk to him.
00:41:16.766,00:41:18.017,"No, I’ll talk to him."
00:41:18.142,00:41:20.186,You’re right. I should have told you myself.
00:41:21.312,00:41:25.483,And I’m sorry. I promise you that I was thinking about you.
00:41:25.566,00:41:27.652,-Stop it! About what’s best for all of us. -Just listen to Dad!
00:41:29.654,00:41:31.656,as a group before anything can be spent.
00:41:31.739,00:41:34.909,It won’t work. I have to get permission from them every time I take a piss?
00:41:34.993,00:41:37.161,It will force you to get along. That’s the most important thing.
00:41:37.245,00:41:38.496,She will side with him every time.
00:41:38.579,00:41:39.872,You’re not even listening to me!
00:41:42.834,00:41:44.377,You just wanna tell me what I can and can’t do.
00:41:47.672,00:41:49.257,"Don’t do this, Dad. They hate me!"
00:41:51.134,00:41:52.093,You’re my son.
00:41:53.720,00:41:54.887,The sons are here.
00:41:55.388,00:41:56.848,They just barged in. I couldn’t stop them.
00:41:56.931,00:41:57.765,I know.
00:42:01.394,00:42:02.854,Losing his temper when he doesn’t get his way.
00:42:02.937,00:42:04.647,Let’s discuss this outside. Our hosts are here.
00:42:04.731,00:42:06.274,No! I want to talk about it now.
00:42:08.359,00:42:09.652,"If you need money, I’ll give you money."
00:42:09.736,00:42:11.029,I don’t want your chump change!
00:42:15.658,00:42:17.952,You’re the poet? The great writer?
00:42:18.786,00:42:19.912,You don’t know anything.
00:42:19.996,00:42:21.789,"They lied to me, they’re robbing me."
00:42:21.873,00:42:24.292,"I don’t know their story, but will you calm down?"
00:42:26.044,00:42:27.128,Will you?
00:42:30.715,00:42:32.258,Thank you.
00:42:34.052,00:42:35.511,Let’s go and sit down and discuss this.
00:42:35.595,00:42:39.557,"No! Mom, Dad’s dying, and all he cares about is his damn money!"
00:42:42.393,00:42:44.228,Look at Dad! Look what you did!
00:42:49.776,00:42:51.069,Stop!
00:42:53.029,00:42:54.822,Stop! Please!
00:43:01.370,00:43:02.371,No!
00:43:09.420,00:43:10.755,No! Stop!
00:43:10.838,00:43:11.964,No!
00:43:14.592,00:43:16.677,No! No!
00:43:19.347,00:43:20.306,Get up.
00:43:21.099,00:43:22.558,Get up! Get up!
00:43:22.767,00:43:24.227,Stop faking. Get up.
00:43:24.519,00:43:25.978,Get up. Look at me!
00:43:29.273,00:43:31.526,"No, look. It’s not my fault."
00:43:31.609,00:43:33.861,It’s not my fault. They never really loved me.
00:43:33.945,00:43:36.489,They always loved him more. They were leaving me behind.
00:43:36.572,00:43:38.282,Just tell me you understand.
00:43:38.366,00:43:39.742,Tell me you understand!
00:43:41.452,00:43:42.537,You have to understand.
00:43:49.001,00:43:51.045,What did you do?
00:43:53.631,00:43:54.966,You did this.
00:44:00.054,00:44:02.056,-Towels. Towels. -Okay.
00:44:13.568,00:44:15.319,-The doctor. Go get him. -Okay.
00:44:18.322,00:44:19.824,-Come quick! -What?
00:44:19.907,00:44:21.909,-What’s happening? -He’s bleeding.
00:44:21.993,00:44:24.328,-It’s bad! It’s really bad. -He’s not waking up. He’s not waking up.
00:44:27.331,00:44:28.749,I’ll call you from the hospital.
00:44:31.419,00:44:32.670,"Please, we need him."
00:44:32.753,00:44:34.422,Lock the doors. I’ll be back as soon as I can.
00:44:34.547,00:44:36.090,Please don’t leave me! Please don’t leave me!
00:50:48.546,00:50:50.214,They left you all alone?
00:50:53.884,00:50:55.386,You do understand.
00:51:09.108,00:51:10.442,Good luck.
00:51:27.251,00:51:28.419,You all right?
00:51:29.670,00:51:31.380,I know. I know. The police brought me home.
00:51:31.463,00:51:32.506,They’ll find him. Don’t worry.
00:51:32.590,00:51:33.757,-Did he hurt you? -No.
00:51:33.841,00:51:35.092,-No? -No.
00:51:35.175,00:51:36.176,Okay.
00:51:37.428,00:51:38.804,"Okay, sit."
00:51:41.348,00:51:42.933,Let me get you some water.
00:51:51.191,00:51:52.359,Here.
00:51:53.944,00:51:55.195,It’s okay.
00:51:57.781,00:51:59.116,It’s all right.
00:52:03.037,00:52:04.872,What happened at the hospital?
00:52:09.043,00:52:13.714,I was holding the boy’s hand when he died.
00:52:18.761,00:52:20.095,"Oh, that’s awful."
00:52:23.849,00:52:25.184,Are you all right?
00:52:26.143,00:52:27.394,I’m exhausted.
00:52:29.188,00:52:30.731,I need a hot shower.
00:52:31.065,00:52:32.399,Will you come?
00:52:32.983,00:52:34.068,Yeah.
00:52:43.911,00:52:46.246,-I’ll be up in a minute. -You sure?
00:52:47.039,00:52:48.165,Yeah.
00:54:10.038,00:54:11.081,In here?
00:54:20.674,00:54:22.509,They came back quick.
00:54:22.593,00:54:23.886,What are they doing here?
00:54:23.969,00:54:28.348,"They had nowhere to go, so I told them it would be all right to invite some friends and family."
00:54:29.057,00:54:30.267,I’ll go deal with them.
00:54:55.876,00:54:57.294,"Please, make yourselves at home."
00:54:57.377,00:54:58.754,I’m so sorry.
00:55:01.465,00:55:03.091,Shall we have a toast?
00:55:08.472,00:55:09.973,He so respects you.
00:55:14.895,00:55:18.398,"Well, how can one begin to understand your pain?"
00:55:20.818,00:55:22.152,The sacrifice of the parent.
00:55:25.697,00:55:29.493,"Years in days, days in hours, hours in seconds."
00:55:29.576,00:55:33.997,"But in each second, an infinite amount of love."
00:55:35.082,00:55:41.046,"And now, suddenly, it seems there is nothing to love."
00:55:42.589,00:55:46.760,Just a vast and silent darkness.
00:55:51.765,00:55:56.019,"From inside it, there’s a voice crying out to be heard..."
00:55:57.479,00:55:59.439,...loud and strong.
00:56:00.774,00:56:02.109,Just listen.
00:56:05.779,00:56:07.281,"Oh, God."
00:56:14.955,00:56:16.206,Do you hear that?
00:56:18.041,00:56:20.419,Do you hear that? That is the sound of life.
00:56:20.502,00:56:22.087,That is the sound of humanity.
00:56:23.922,00:56:25.799,That is your son’s voice.
00:56:29.219,00:56:30.470,His cry of love.
00:56:31.305,00:56:32.639,His love for you.
00:56:35.809,00:56:37.144,-Thank you. -My pleasure.
00:56:42.816,00:56:44.318,and being with us tonight.
00:56:44.401,00:56:46.987,My husband and I are so touched.
00:56:51.825,00:56:55.621,"I can’t believe that just a few hours ago, he was standing there, and..."
00:56:55.746,00:56:57.539,I was holding him in my arms.
00:56:57.623,00:56:59.499,He was so full of life.
00:56:59.583,00:57:00.959,He always was.
00:57:04.254,00:57:06.173,-Hello. -Thank you.
00:57:20.520,00:57:22.981,I’ll never hold him again like I did today.
00:57:23.065,00:57:24.900,He’ll never laugh again.
00:57:25.859,00:57:29.446,"I just want to thank you all for being here, and..."
00:57:29.529,00:57:32.824,It means so much. I don’t know what else to say.
00:57:33.533,00:57:39.456,I just want to thank our dear host for his hospitality -in our time of need. -Of course.
00:57:39.539,00:57:44.503,"So, please, I’d like to drink to your kindness."
00:57:56.640,00:57:58.225,"No, I want to."
00:57:58.892,00:58:00.477,I loved my son.
00:58:01.436,00:58:02.771,I loved him.
00:58:05.899,00:58:07.401,I can’t believe this.
00:58:09.820,00:58:11.780,But I shouldn’t be eulogizing him.
00:58:11.863,00:58:13.073,He’d say...
00:58:19.997,00:58:21.498,I’m sorry. I can’t.
00:58:22.249,00:58:23.792,Would someone please...
00:58:26.086,00:58:27.587,Would you say something?
00:58:36.596,00:58:37.723,I...
00:58:41.018,00:58:42.436,For your child.
00:58:44.855,00:58:47.607,For both your children. Come.
00:58:47.691,00:58:53.822,"Let’s not forget the one Wherever he goes, wherever he is..."
00:58:53.905,00:58:55.323,Welcome. Please join us.
00:58:55.407,00:58:56.783,I’m just gonna put this in the kitchen.
00:58:58.118,00:59:02.039,"May he find kindness, compassion..."
00:59:09.921,00:59:11.590,That sink’s not braced yet.
00:59:11.923,00:59:13.341,"Oh, I’m sorry."
00:59:31.985,00:59:34.029,"That was so beautiful, no?"
00:59:35.906,00:59:37.324,It’s all right.
00:59:38.408,00:59:39.618,Can I use your phone?
00:59:39.993,00:59:41.912,Sure. It’s in the kitchen.
00:59:42.704,00:59:43.663,"No, it’s just..."
00:59:44.289,00:59:45.332,Excuse...
00:59:45.749,00:59:47.084,Excuse me?
00:59:51.046,00:59:52.339,Where did you go?
00:59:53.924,00:59:55.425,I was just in the...
00:59:56.927,00:59:59.513,"I’m really sorry, again."
00:59:59.596,01:00:00.764,I know you are.
01:00:01.598,01:00:03.308,-I can’t imagine... -No.
01:00:04.893,01:00:08.605,You can’t imagine what it feels like if you don’t have a child.
01:00:10.107,01:00:12.442,"You give, and you give, and you give, and..."
01:00:14.528,01:00:17.447,It’s just never enough.
01:00:21.201,01:00:22.702,-I understand. -Do you?
01:00:25.247,01:00:27.916,Why don’t you at least put on something decent?
01:00:59.281,01:01:00.448,Hey!
01:01:08.790,01:01:09.958,You can’t be in here.
01:01:10.250,01:01:12.419,-I’m sorry? -You need to leave.
01:01:13.211,01:01:15.922,-We’ll just be a minute. -This is our room!
01:01:23.680,01:01:25.015,It’s your room.
01:01:27.184,01:01:29.102,Come on. Let’s find another spot.
01:02:00.342,01:02:01.218,Oh.
01:02:01.301,01:02:02.302,Excuse me.
01:02:02.385,01:02:03.553,Just exploring.
01:02:30.372,01:02:31.373,Excuse me.
01:02:31.456,01:02:32.791,Could you please go downstairs?
01:02:33.500,01:02:35.710,-This way? -Yes.
01:03:02.028,01:03:03.363,What is...
01:03:11.079,01:03:12.580,What are you doing?
01:03:12.664,01:03:13.832,"Oh, it’s no big deal."
01:03:13.915,01:03:15.333,I worked my way through college doing this.
01:03:15.417,01:03:17.919,But why are you painting my house?
01:03:18.003,01:03:21.006,"Well, he’s been so kind to everyone, it’s the least we could do."
01:03:23.341,01:03:24.426,Stop!
01:03:24.509,01:03:27.053,Both of you. Stop!
01:03:27.137,01:03:28.388,No problem.
01:03:33.518,01:03:35.353,There you are! My goddess. Come here.
01:03:35.437,01:03:37.856,"Please, make some room for her. Thank you. Here."
01:03:37.939,01:03:39.899,You’ve got to hear these stories.
01:03:39.983,01:03:41.151,All these people!
01:03:41.234,01:03:42.902,I know. They’re just letting off steam.
01:03:42.986,01:03:44.654,They’re painting our house!
01:03:50.285,01:03:51.411,I got it.
01:04:03.131,01:04:05.216,Please! Get down from there.
01:04:05.300,01:04:06.259,Sorry.
01:04:06.843,01:04:08.053,Excuse me.
01:04:15.393,01:04:16.561,"Hey, we haven’t met."
01:04:16.644,01:04:18.521,I’ve known this family for years. And you?
01:04:19.314,01:04:20.523,This is my house.
01:04:22.442,01:04:25.820,"Well, it’s a beautiful home. You want to take a walk?"
01:04:25.904,01:04:28.156,-What? -A walk. With me.
01:04:28.907,01:04:30.575,No. No.
01:04:30.992,01:04:32.160,Please!
01:04:32.952,01:04:35.163,"-Take my number. -No, I don’t want your number."
01:04:35.246,01:04:36.331,Why would you say that?
01:04:36.414,01:04:37.999,You don’t even know me. Let me give you my number.
01:04:38.083,01:04:39.709,-Let go of me! -Why?
01:04:41.753,01:04:43.755,-Get down from there. -From where?
01:04:43.880,01:04:45.882,You don’t know what I could do for you.
01:04:45.965,01:04:47.509,I don’t want anything from you.
01:04:47.592,01:04:48.593,Sassy.
01:04:49.135,01:04:50.637,Leave me alone.
01:04:52.180,01:04:54.224,You know what? Get out of my face.
01:04:54.307,01:04:55.809,You’re an arrogant cunt.
01:04:57.018,01:04:58.770,This sink. There’s nothing wrong with it.
01:04:58.853,01:05:00.105,It’s really okay.
01:05:00.188,01:05:02.357,"No, stop doing that. Don’t do that. Stop!"
01:05:02.524,01:05:04.526,"Stop doing that! Stop, stop!"
01:05:10.615,01:05:13.368,"Get out! Get out, all of you!"
01:05:13.451,01:05:14.869,What happened?
01:05:14.953,01:05:16.454,They won’t listen!
01:05:16.538,01:05:19.124,It’s all right. We’ll fix it. It can be fixed.
01:05:21.334,01:05:23.086,-We’ll turn it off. -It’s been an honor.
01:05:23.169,01:05:24.712,We will never forget all you’ve done for us.
01:06:21.436,01:06:22.395,They’re gone.
01:06:23.855,01:06:26.107,Come. Let’s go to bed. You don’t need to do that.
01:06:26.191,01:06:27.275,Do what?
01:06:27.901,01:06:29.402,Clean up their mess?
01:06:31.863,01:06:33.448,We did a good thing.
01:06:33.531,01:06:35.116,They needed a place to celebrate life.
01:06:35.200,01:06:36.284,They needed tonight.
01:06:36.367,01:06:37.410,What about what I needed?
01:06:38.536,01:06:41.956,A boy died here today. I mopped up his blood.
01:06:42.040,01:06:43.500,And you abandoned me.
01:06:43.583,01:06:45.543,"No, no, I didn’t abandon you."
01:06:45.627,01:06:48.796,"They just lost a son. They lost, well, two sons!"
01:06:48.880,01:06:50.173,I was helping them.
01:06:50.256,01:06:51.633,This is not about us. It’s about them.
01:06:51.716,01:06:54.427,No! It’s not about them. It’s about you.
01:06:54.802,01:06:58.056,It’s always about you and your work.
01:06:58.139,01:07:00.308,You think that’s gonna help you write?
01:07:00.391,01:07:01.809,Nothing does!
01:07:02.310,01:07:04.979,"I rebuilt this entire house, wall to wall."
01:07:05.063,01:07:06.814,You haven’t written a word!
01:07:06.898,01:07:10.068,I know! I know! I’m sorry! I can’t... I can’t write!
01:07:10.151,01:07:11.194,I can’t think!
01:07:11.277,01:07:14.155,All I’m trying to do is bring life into this house!
01:07:14.239,01:07:17.450,"Open the door to new people, new ideas."
01:07:17.534,01:07:19.160,You think you can’t breathe?
01:07:19.244,01:07:24.249,I’m the one who’s suffocating here while you pretend that nothing is wrong!
01:07:24.332,01:07:26.668,Everything will be all right. Everything will be good. You’ll be fine.
01:07:26.751,01:07:30.255,You know what? Life doesn’t always work out the way you want it to.
01:07:31.339,01:07:32.590,You’re right.
01:07:33.758,01:07:35.385,Mine certainly didn’t.
01:07:35.468,01:07:36.553,Excuse me?
01:07:37.679,01:07:41.349,"You talk about wanting kids, but you can’t even fuck me."
01:07:46.020,01:07:48.314,-Come here. Come here! -No! No!
01:08:55.423,01:08:56.674,I’m pregnant.
01:09:02.221,01:09:03.389,I’m pregnant.
01:09:06.059,01:09:07.060,Hmm?
01:09:08.770,01:09:10.480,We’re gonna have a baby.
01:09:15.318,01:09:16.402,I’m serious.
01:09:19.113,01:09:20.490,How could you know?
01:09:21.115,01:09:22.784,Because I know.
01:09:24.577,01:09:25.662,I’m pregnant.
01:09:38.966,01:09:41.135,-Are you happy? -Happy?
01:09:47.475,01:09:51.062,That’s the most beautiful gift.
01:10:00.238,01:10:01.239,What?
01:10:08.996,01:10:09.872,No...
01:10:12.250,01:10:14.419,"Pen, pen, pen."
01:10:20.675,01:10:22.176,What are you doing?
01:10:23.511,01:10:24.929,I’m writing.
01:10:25.012,01:10:26.389,-What? -Writing.
01:10:26.472,01:10:28.266,"Last night, those people."
01:10:28.349,01:10:31.519,Their pain. Their love behind the pain. And then...
01:10:32.395,01:10:33.396,You.
01:10:34.605,01:10:35.565,Us.
01:10:36.107,01:10:37.567,And now that...
01:10:38.693,01:10:39.736,Life.
01:10:40.862,01:10:42.864,It’s coming to me. It’s...
01:10:42.947,01:10:44.657,I know what to say. I have to find the words.
01:10:44.824,01:10:45.700,That’s all.
01:10:45.783,01:10:46.743,Amazing.
01:10:50.204,01:10:51.789,"Well, I won’t..."
01:10:51.873,01:10:53.040,I don’t want to interrupt.
01:10:53.124,01:10:56.210,I’ll just get started on the apocalypse.
01:10:59.338,01:11:00.423,I love you.
01:12:36.060,01:12:37.520,It moved!
01:12:38.479,01:12:39.856,It moved!
01:12:44.235,01:12:45.486,What is it?
01:12:52.618,01:12:53.953,Is that it?
01:12:56.289,01:12:57.790,I finished it.
01:13:10.344,01:13:11.429,May I?
01:14:19.956,01:14:21.290,It’s beautiful.
01:14:24.752,01:14:25.962,Really?
01:14:28.381,01:14:29.882,Why are you crying?
01:14:30.758,01:14:33.094,It’s just a lot.
01:14:35.012,01:14:36.514,You think it’s good?
01:14:38.307,01:14:39.642,It’s perfect.
01:14:45.272,01:14:48.567,"But then, what’s going on?"
01:14:50.236,01:14:51.904,Am I going to lose you?
01:14:56.117,01:14:57.118,Never.
01:15:10.631,01:15:11.632,Hello?
01:15:12.883,01:15:13.884,Hi.
01:15:16.470,01:15:17.471,Yes?
01:15:19.640,01:15:20.641,Really?
01:15:25.062,01:15:27.106,One moment. Give me a second. They loved it.
01:15:27.565,01:15:28.649,Who did?
01:15:28.733,01:15:31.861,"What? Yeah, I’ll be here, standing by. Oh..."
01:15:31.986,01:15:33.738,Are you there? Hello?
01:15:36.032,01:15:37.867,-Who was that? -My publisher.

01:47:03.083,01:47:04.418,Do you hear that?
01:47:19.516,01:47:21.477,The sound of humanity!
01:47:21.894,01:47:23.646,His cry of love!
01:47:23.729,01:47:25.814,His love for you!
01:47:36.825,01:47:38.661,Get off! Get off!
01:47:48.337,01:47:50.381,You killed him!
01:48:02.017,01:48:03.852,"-Die, cunt! -Dirty whore!"

01:48:21.620,01:48:24.289,Go away. Leave her alone. What are you doing?
01:48:24.373,01:48:26.000,Look what they’ve done to you.
01:48:29.420,01:48:30.713,Look what they've done to you.
01:48:30.796,01:48:34.133,What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:48:52.317,01:48:53.569,It was...
01:48:54.111,01:48:57.364,It’s horrible. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
01:48:58.574,01:49:00.159,But we can’t...
01:49:00.242,01:49:02.786,We can’t let him die for nothing. We can’t.
01:49:03.746,01:49:07.374,Maybe what happened could change everything.
01:49:07.916,01:49:09.126,Everyone.

01:49:38.197,01:49:41.283,We need to forgive them. We need to forgive them!
01:50:11.230,01:50:13.357,Murderers!
01:50:13.816,01:50:15.317,Murderer!
01:50:19.196,01:50:21.031,...out of my house!
01:50:22.491,01:50:24.660,No! Please! Don’t leave!
01:50:24.743,01:50:26.578,No! Please! I beg you!
01:50:26.662,01:50:28.997,Don’t run off! We will rebuild!
01:51:04.449,01:51:07.369,Stop! Stop! Wait. Wait.
01:51:11.790,01:51:13.542,Don’t! Don’t! Don’t!
01:51:13.625,01:51:14.960,Please don’t.
01:51:15.961,01:51:17.004,I love you.
01:51:17.754,01:51:19.256,You never loved me.
01:51:21.216,01:51:23.552,You just loved how much I loved you.
01:51:25.345,01:51:27.306,I gave you everything!
01:51:30.517,01:51:32.352,You gave it all away.
01:51:34.062,01:51:35.981,No. No. No.
01:51:36.064,01:51:37.900,"No, no, no, no!"
01:52:29.117,01:52:30.702,What are you?
01:52:30.786,01:52:31.787,Me?
01:52:32.955,01:52:34.539,I am I.
01:52:35.207,01:52:36.375,You?
01:52:37.584,01:52:38.919,You were home.
01:52:42.339,01:52:44.174,Where are you taking me?
01:52:48.095,01:52:49.096,The beginning.
01:53:09.116,01:53:10.284,Is that it?
01:53:15.414,01:53:18.667,What hurts me the most is that I wasn’t enough.
01:53:19.334,01:53:20.752,It’s not your fault.
01:53:22.296,01:53:24.006,Nothing is ever enough.
01:53:24.756,01:53:26.466,I couldn’t create if it was.
01:53:27.509,01:53:29.886,And I have to. That’s what I do.
01:53:31.430,01:53:33.432,That’s what I am.
01:53:35.517,01:53:38.186,Now I must try it all again.
01:53:38.478,01:53:39.479,No.
01:53:40.814,01:53:42.566,Just let me go.
01:53:46.445,01:53:48.613,I need one last thing.
01:53:50.532,01:53:52.492,I have nothing left to give.
01:53:55.954,01:53:57.039,Your love.
01:54:05.297,01:54:06.882,"It’s still there, isn’t it?"
01:54:15.307,01:54:16.391,Go ahead.
01:54:19.061,01:54:20.228,Take it.
01:56:18.847,01:56:20.015,Baby?
