00:00:40.832,00:00:43.251,"You guys, just start without me."
00:00:45.253,00:00:46.463,I'll catch up!
00:00:56.014,00:00:57.474,Sweet.
00:01:16.534,00:01:18.953,Inner peace.
00:01:19.162,00:01:21.623,Inner peace.
00:01:23.958,00:01:25.877,Itchy nose.
00:01:32.342,00:01:35.094,"Finally, inner peace."
00:01:36.387,00:01:37.222,Now what?
00:01:49.609,00:01:51.444,"Kai, old friend."
00:01:53.780,00:01:55.740,Master Oogway.
00:01:55.907,00:01:58.910,Our battle ended 500 years ago!
00:01:59.494,00:02:01.496,"Well, now I'm ready for a rematch."
00:02:02.038,00:02:03.748,Took you long enough!
00:02:19.848,00:02:21.599,You've grown stronger.
00:02:27.355,00:02:32.068,"500 years in the Spirit Realm, you pick up a thing or two."
00:02:32.318,00:02:35.947,I have taken the chi of every master here.
00:02:36.906,00:02:38.116,-No! -Yes.
00:02:38.783,00:02:41.411,"And soon I will have your power, too."
00:02:41.619,00:02:45.874,"When will you realize? The more you take, the less you have."
00:03:06.895,00:03:11.858,"With your chi, I will finally be able to return to the mortal world."
00:03:12.108,00:03:15.653,"And this time, you won't be there to stop me."
00:03:17.113,00:03:19.908,It was never my destiny to stop you.
00:03:20.116,00:03:22.744,I have set another on that path.
00:03:28.541,00:03:29.959,Then I will find him...
00:03:30.585,00:03:32.795,"and take his chi, too."
00:03:51.314,00:03:54.150,Justice is about to be served!
00:04:15.463,00:04:17.131,Yee-haw!
00:04:49.622,00:04:51.124,"We'll have two Justice Platters, please."
00:04:51.207,00:04:52.083,"-Um, three. -Three."
00:04:52.166,00:04:53.251,And a few tofu buns.
00:04:53.501,00:04:55.920,"Oh, the spicy noodle soup for Tigress. Did you want extra sauce with that?"
00:04:56.004,00:04:57.005,She wants it on the side.
00:04:57.088,00:04:58.464,-On the side. -On the side.
00:05:00.174,00:05:01.592,"Go, Dragon Warrior! You can do it!"
00:05:01.676,00:05:02.635,"Go, Dragon Warrior!"
00:05:02.719,00:05:04.012,Defend the Valley!
00:05:04.095,00:05:05.471,Dragon Warrior!
00:05:08.308,00:05:09.684,"Go, Dragon Warrior!"
00:05:09.767,00:05:11.394,Yeah! Defend the Valley!
00:05:13.855,00:05:15.189,Yee-haw!
00:05:16.357,00:05:18.234,"You guys aren't doing the Dramatic Pose, are you?"
00:05:18.443,00:05:20.528,Do we have to strike a pose every time we land?
00:05:21.112,00:05:24.324,"You guys, never underestimate the power of a dramatic entrance."
00:05:24.449,00:05:27.493,I've heard about some masters who can win a fight just by throwing open a door.
00:05:29.454,00:05:30.455,Oh!
00:05:30.538,00:05:31.664,Dramatic entrance?
00:05:32.206,00:05:33.082,Master Shifu.
00:05:33.166,00:05:35.084,The Dragon Warrior is correct.
00:05:35.168,00:05:36.836,"Really? I was just making, uh..."
00:05:36.919,00:05:38.838,"Yeah. I mean, yeah. I am."
00:05:38.921,00:05:41.799,Before the battle of the fist comes the battle of the mind.
00:05:42.175,00:05:44.385,"Hence, the dramatic entrance."
00:05:55.855,00:05:56.981,Whoa!
00:05:57.065,00:06:00.151,Nice dramatic entrance. What's the occasion?
00:06:00.234,00:06:02.904,Today will be my final class.
00:06:03.279,00:06:04.572,Your final... Wait.
00:06:04.655,00:06:07.575,I didn't even know you were sick! Although you have been looking a little...
00:06:07.658,00:06:08.826,-I'm not sick. -Healthy.
00:06:08.910,00:06:10.411,"A little healthy. A lot, actually."
00:06:11.662,00:06:18.419,"My final class, because from now on your training will be in the hands of the Dragon Warrior."
00:06:20.838,00:06:21.923,What?
00:06:24.217,00:06:25.968,"Me, teach? I mean, why not Tigress?"
00:06:26.052,00:06:27.386,She's always telling everyone what to do.
00:06:27.470,00:06:29.472,"-Be quiet, Po. -You see what I mean?"
00:06:29.764,00:06:32.642,Tigress is not the Dragon Warrior. You are.
00:06:32.975,00:06:34.477,"Come on, they're the Five."
00:06:34.560,00:06:36.145,What could I teach them?
00:06:36.229,00:06:39.982,"There is always something more to learn, even for a master."
00:06:40.650,00:06:43.319,"For instance, let me show you another move..."
00:06:44.112,00:06:45.780,the Dramatic Exit.
00:06:46.697,00:06:47.990,What's that?
00:06:49.867,00:06:52.411,Wow! Are you kidding me?
00:06:52.787,00:06:54.956,That's... Where'd he go?
00:06:55.581,00:06:56.916,Master.
00:07:00.086,00:07:01.963,"We await your instruction, Master."
00:07:02.421,00:07:05.174,All you have to lose is our respect.
00:07:08.845,00:07:10.930,"I mean, seriously, how bad can it be?"
00:07:11.347,00:07:13.307,"Very bad! Very, very bad!"
00:07:13.641,00:07:15.476,"Okay, okay. Let's switch it up."
00:07:15.560,00:07:17.311,Monkey! Immovable Mountain Stance!
00:07:17.437,00:07:18.938,"Yes, Master!"
00:07:19.939,00:07:22.066,"I mean, ah... Tigress, Tornado Back Flip!"
00:07:22.275,00:07:23.276,"Yes, Master."
00:07:24.986,00:07:26.362,"Oh, no! Fire!"
00:07:26.446,00:07:27.655,Fire! Stop!
00:07:28.197,00:07:29.323,Sorry! My fault.
00:07:29.449,00:07:31.033,"Crane, go high. I mean low! Low!"
00:07:32.994,00:07:34.203,"Oh, my claw thingy!"
00:07:34.912,00:07:39.000,"Viper and Tigress, do, like, a Totem Pole Poison Technique!"
00:07:39.333,00:07:45.840,"Uh, you two, do a Swarming Insect Bite with a Yellow Tail, Yellow Jacket, Spicy Tuna..."
00:07:46.215,00:07:47.216,I'm sorry.
00:07:52.597,00:07:54.640,"Good job, Po."
00:07:56.142,00:07:57.351,Ah.
00:07:57.768,00:07:59.562,Did you at least learn a little something?
00:08:00.104,00:08:01.314,Yes.
00:08:01.397,00:08:02.815,That you can't teach.
00:08:03.149,00:08:05.776,"And Tigress is flammable, it turns out."
00:08:17.288,00:08:18.331,What a loser!
00:08:24.837,00:08:26.547,I think he heard us.
00:08:27.131,00:08:28.841,I didn't hear anything.
00:08:29.133,00:08:30.801,"Uh, he said you're a loser."
00:08:43.272,00:08:44.857,"I'm sorry, Oogway."
00:08:47.527,00:08:48.903,Would you stop doing that?
00:08:49.070,00:08:50.321,How was your first day teaching?
00:08:50.780,00:08:52.782,-Humiliating. -I heard.
00:08:53.074,00:08:54.742,Who told you? Did Tigress tell you?
00:08:54.825,00:09:03.334,"I heard from Monkey, and Crane, and Mantis, and your dad, and Mrs. Chow from the gift shop, and those ducks you just passed, and Tigress told me."
00:09:03.584,00:09:06.712,Did she also tell you that it'll never happen again? Because I'm done.
00:09:06.796,00:09:08.673,Teaching or being humiliated?
00:09:09.006,00:09:11.551,Both! I don't know why you ever thought I could teach that class.
00:09:12.009,00:09:13.094,"Oh, I knew you couldn't."
00:09:13.719,00:09:16.430,What? You set me up to fail? Why?
00:09:16.764,00:09:21.769,"If you only do what you can do, you will never be more than you are now."
00:09:22.061,00:09:24.647,I don't wanna be more! I like who I am.
00:09:24.730,00:09:27.441,You don't even know who you are.
00:09:27.525,00:09:28.818,"What do you... Of course, I do."
00:09:28.901,00:09:30.444,I'm the Dragon Warrior.
00:09:30.903,00:09:33.573,"And what exactly does that mean, Dragon Warrior?"
00:09:35.825,00:09:36.826,Hmm.
00:09:37.034,00:09:41.747,"It means, you know, just going around and punching and kicking."
00:09:41.831,00:09:44.250,Defending the Valley! And stuff.
00:09:44.709,00:09:46.002,Punching and kicking?
00:09:46.335,00:09:49.797,You think that is what the great Master Oogway saw for you?
00:09:50.673,00:09:58.598,A 500-year prophecy fulfilled so you could spend your days kicking butt and running through town high-fiving bunnies?
00:09:59.599,00:10:01.142,-Yes? -No!
00:10:02.226,00:10:04.645,"Oogway saw greatness in you, Po."
00:10:04.812,00:10:06.355,Against my better judgment.
00:10:06.981,00:10:09.859,More than you can see in yourself.
00:10:09.984,00:10:12.612,Incredible power awaits you.
00:10:14.030,00:10:17.450,Power beyond anything you can imagine.
00:10:33.549,00:10:35.551,Wow! What was that?
00:10:35.760,00:10:36.969,That was chi.
00:10:37.261,00:10:38.262,Wow!
00:10:38.929,00:10:40.181,What's chi?
00:10:40.264,00:10:44.685,The energy that flows through all living things.
00:10:44.852,00:10:48.439,"So you're saying if I teach, I'll be able to do cool stuff like that?"
00:10:48.522,00:10:52.610,"No. I'm saying if you teach, I'll be able to do cool stuff like that."
00:10:52.735,00:10:53.611,Oh...
00:10:53.694,00:10:57.156,Mastering chi requires mastery of self.
00:10:57.573,00:11:02.953,Oogway sat alone in a cave for 30 years asking one question.
00:11:03.454,00:11:04.789,Who am I?
00:11:05.456,00:11:06.832,Who am I?
00:11:07.083,00:11:09.710,I'm lucky if I get five minutes before you interrupt...
00:11:13.005,00:11:15.674,Eventually. After you master teaching.
00:11:15.883,00:11:18.928,Teaching? There's no way I'm ever gonna be like you.
00:11:19.136,00:11:21.055,I'm not trying to turn you into me.
00:11:21.389,00:11:25.101,I'm trying to turn you into you.
00:11:28.104,00:11:30.398,Turn me into me?
00:11:30.481,00:11:31.816,"Wait a second, that makes no..."
00:11:31.899,00:11:32.983,"Almost there, Shifu."
00:11:33.067,00:11:35.486,Just a little more confusing and you'll be the next Oogway.
00:11:37.029,00:11:38.072,"Oh, ah..."
00:11:38.489,00:11:40.908,"Sorry, no offense, Master Oogway. I just..."
00:11:42.368,00:11:43.786,I'll let you get back to your eternal peace.
00:12:25.286,00:12:26.704,What is this place?
00:12:27.246,00:12:29.290,Uh... My brother's farm?
00:12:29.582,00:12:30.624,Ah.
00:12:31.041,00:12:34.086,"If I stepped on you, would you die?"
00:12:37.923,00:12:39.675,The mortal realm.
00:12:40.634,00:12:43.846,"You hear that, Oogway? I'm back."
00:12:44.638,00:12:47.183,Kai has returned!
00:12:50.227,00:12:52.396,Kai. General Kai.
00:12:52.480,00:12:54.982,Supreme Warlord of all China.
00:12:55.941,00:12:56.901,-Eh? -Hmm...
00:12:57.151,00:13:00.988,The Jade Slayer. Master of Pain.
00:13:01.155,00:13:03.240,You may know me as the Beast of Vengeance.
00:13:03.449,00:13:05.784,"Uh, Maker of Widows?"
00:13:06.160,00:13:07.036,Eh?
00:13:08.370,00:13:10.080,"Okay, I used to work with Oogway."
00:13:10.372,00:13:11.540,"-Oh, Master Oogway! -Master Oogway!"
00:13:11.624,00:13:12.917,"Now, he was a great warrior."
00:13:13.000,00:13:14.251,We've heard of Master Oogway.
00:13:14.335,00:13:16.253,"Okay, okay, enough. Silence!"
00:13:24.428,00:13:27.139,"Find Oogway's students, and bring them to me."
00:13:34.063,00:13:41.654,"By the time I am done with them, Oogway, there will be no one left who will even remember your name."
00:13:48.786,00:13:50.162,I am ready...
00:13:51.288,00:13:52.831,to teach you a lesson.
00:13:52.915,00:13:55.167,"Teach me? Oh, no! It's the Dragon Teacher!"
00:13:55.376,00:13:56.835,"Yeah, he's so handsome!"
00:13:56.919,00:13:58.128,Thank you for the compliment.
00:14:01.173,00:14:02.925,Ah! No! Please don't teach me to death!
00:14:04.385,00:14:05.427,Po?
00:14:05.511,00:14:07.096,"Hey, Dad. What's up?"
00:14:08.305,00:14:11.725,"I was just, uh, stopping by for a little soak."
00:14:16.146,00:14:18.274,-Okay. What's wrong? -Nothing.
00:14:18.357,00:14:21.861,Nothing? I come home to find you taking a bath with your dolls...
00:14:21.944,00:14:22.945,Action figures.
00:14:23.028,00:14:27.116,"...and instead of adding bath salts to the water, you just added Szechuan peppercorns."
00:14:27.199,00:14:28.325,Szechuan...
00:14:28.993,00:14:29.952,"Oh, oh, oh!"
00:14:30.035,00:14:31.287,My tenders!
00:14:33.873,00:14:35.416,"Okay, yes, something's wrong."
00:14:35.499,00:14:36.542,"There, there, son."
00:14:36.625,00:14:38.294,You tell your daddy all about it.
00:14:38.460,00:14:39.837,Lift your arm.
00:14:39.920,00:14:42.798,Shifu says I don't know what it means to be the Dragon Warrior.
00:14:43.173,00:14:44.925,Now I have to be a teacher?
00:14:45.676,00:14:49.138,"I thought I finally knew who I was. If I'm not the Dragon Warrior, who am I?"
00:14:49.430,00:14:51.515,A teacher? Teaching kung fu?
00:14:54.351,00:14:55.519,"Take the job, son!"
00:14:55.603,00:15:01.233,"And, someday when you're in charge of the whole Jade Palace I can sell noodles in the lobby!"
00:15:01.775,00:15:03.652,Why are you still here taking a bath like a baby?
00:15:03.736,00:15:05.946,"Get out! Get up! Go, go, go!"
00:15:06.030,00:15:08.032,Franchise expansion awaits us!
00:15:08.115,00:15:10.242,But what about the Dragon Warrior look-alike contest?
00:15:10.326,00:15:12.036,"Oh, Mrs. Chow always wins that."
00:15:12.578,00:15:13.662,Skadoosh.
00:15:14.079,00:15:16.081,And the Dragon Warrior dumpling-eating contest?
00:15:16.415,00:15:17.708,I have to defend my title.
00:15:17.791,00:15:20.294,No one's gonna beat your dumpling-eating record.
00:15:20.711,00:15:22.379,Someone's about to beat your dumpling-eating record!
00:15:25.466,00:15:26.842,Who's eating my dumplings?
00:15:27.051,00:15:28.469,And who's paying for them?
00:15:29.261,00:15:31.931,101! 102!
00:15:38.145,00:15:40.981,103!
00:15:50.658,00:15:52.284,Who are you?
00:15:52.368,00:15:54.036,I am Li Shan.
00:15:54.286,00:15:55.120,What?
00:15:57.915,00:15:59.541,I'm Li Shan.
00:16:00.167,00:16:01.794,I'm looking for my son.
00:16:06.131,00:16:07.424,You lost your son?
00:16:07.508,00:16:08.467,Yes.
00:16:09.009,00:16:10.803,Many years ago.
00:16:11.512,00:16:12.972,I lost my father.
00:16:13.681,00:16:14.890,I'm very sorry.
00:16:15.724,00:16:16.850,Thank you.
00:16:19.561,00:16:22.064,"Well, good luck to you."
00:16:22.731,00:16:23.774,"You, too."
00:16:24.233,00:16:25.651,I hope you find your son.
00:16:26.402,00:16:28.696,And I hope you find your father.
00:16:40.708,00:16:42.876,"Oh, my gosh, it is you!"
00:16:44.086,00:16:46.463,"Well, don't just stand there. Give your old man a hug!"
00:16:49.967,00:16:51.635,I can't believe you're alive!
00:16:56.640,00:16:59.727,"I thought I lost you forever, Little Lotus."
00:17:00.352,00:17:06.358,"Uh, okay. This is very embarrassing but I think you've got me confused with a panda named Lotus. My name is Po."
00:17:06.859,00:17:09.903,"Oh, right, you wouldn't know. Okay."
00:17:09.987,00:17:12.990,"See, Little Lotus was the name you were given at birth."
00:17:14.700,00:17:17.578,"I can't believe it! After all these years, you're really here?"
00:17:17.661,00:17:18.787,This is amazing!
00:17:19.496,00:17:22.166,"Oh, Dad! Come! Say hi to..."
00:17:22.499,00:17:25.169,I don't know what I'm supposed to call you.
00:17:25.252,00:17:26.962,I'm pretty sure he said his name is Li.
00:17:27.588,00:17:28.756,You...
00:17:29.256,00:17:30.883,Come here.
00:17:31.800,00:17:35.971,"Thank you, thank you, for taking such good care of my son."
00:17:36.055,00:17:39.433,"Your son? Now, hold on just a minute."
00:17:39.516,00:17:43.103,How do we know this stranger is even related to you?
00:17:43.187,00:17:44.688,Look at that.
00:17:44.772,00:17:47.232,-Our bellies could be brothers! -That is so cool.
00:17:47.316,00:17:49.151,"Hey, son, let me teach you how to belly gong."
00:17:49.234,00:17:50.819,-All right. Belly gong. -They jiggle the same!
00:17:51.028,00:17:52.654,"Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle."
00:17:57.576,00:17:59.369,I can't believe we're taking a picture together.
00:18:03.665,00:18:05.375,But I still don't understand.
00:18:05.626,00:18:07.461,I thought Po was the only panda left.
00:18:08.170,00:18:10.672,"Oh, no. There's a whole bunch of us."
00:18:10.839,00:18:12.132,Where?
00:18:12.299,00:18:14.635,A secret panda village in the mountains.
00:18:18.013,00:18:19.723,But how did you know where I was?
00:18:19.807,00:18:22.726,I received a message that led me here.
00:18:22.810,00:18:26.939,How could you receive a message if no one could find you?
00:18:27.022,00:18:28.357,Sounds suspicious to me.
00:18:29.483,00:18:31.944,"No, it was a message from the universe."
00:18:32.111,00:18:33.612,-Whoa! -Whoa.
00:18:33.737,00:18:34.571,Rats!
00:18:34.655,00:18:37.741,"Now, what's all this about a Dragon Warrior?"
00:18:37.991,00:18:39.827,How did you know I was a Dragon Warrior?
00:18:39.952,00:18:41.328,"Did the universe tell you that, too?"
00:18:42.871,00:18:45.165,"No, the poster did. And the gift shop."
00:18:45.457,00:18:46.625,I bought a tiny cup.
00:18:47.209,00:18:49.086,"Ooh, right, of course!"
00:18:49.753,00:18:52.422,You have no idea. There's so much to show you.
00:18:52.506,00:18:54.383,You're gonna be so awesomely proud.
00:18:54.466,00:18:55.968,"Come on, come on!"
00:18:57.678,00:18:59.763,I'm already awesomely proud.
00:19:04.101,00:19:06.019,-Couple more steps. -Give me a minute.
00:19:06.103,00:19:06.979,Feeling the burn.
00:19:07.771,00:19:09.940,"Do you have panda asthma, too?"
00:19:10.190,00:19:11.525,Does that run in the family?
00:19:11.942,00:19:14.236,"Dad, you're gonna love this."
00:19:14.695,00:19:16.321,"It's, like, the coolest thing ever."
00:19:17.656,00:19:19.867,This is the Hall of Heroes.
00:19:20.242,00:19:23.078,Home of the most priceless kung fu artifacts in all of China!
00:19:23.162,00:19:26.165,Whoa! This place is...
00:19:26.248,00:19:27.583,Awesome? Were you gonna say...
00:19:27.666,00:19:29.626,"You were gonna say awesome, right? Because it totally is!"
00:19:29.710,00:19:30.961,-Totally! -But be super careful.
00:19:31.044,00:19:32.588,Everything's very fragile here.
00:19:32.671,00:19:34.423,Like the Urn of Whispering Warriors.
00:19:34.756,00:19:36.133,Someone broke that once.
00:19:36.425,00:19:37.968,-Who? -Some idiot.
00:19:38.177,00:19:39.261,Wow!
00:19:39.761,00:19:41.805,This is Master Flying Rhino's battle armor!
00:19:41.889,00:19:44.099,I wonder if I could fit in that.
00:19:44.308,00:19:46.685,"Get out of my head, Dad! I've wondered the same thing!"
00:19:46.768,00:19:49.188,"-If I could fit in it? -If you could? No, if I could fit."
00:19:49.313,00:19:50.939,"-Oh. -Dad, check it out!"
00:19:51.773,00:19:54.234,"Master Ram's crossbow, the infamous Gate Smasher."
00:19:54.318,00:19:56.945,"Dad, look at this! The battle helmets of Master Rat's army."
00:19:57.029,00:19:58.071,They're so tiny!
00:19:58.906,00:20:01.742,Master Dolphin's waterproof armor! This is my favorite.
00:20:02.034,00:20:04.995,Check it out. It's the legendary battle rickshaw of Emperor Hawk.
00:20:06.413,00:20:08.081,Sweet ride.
00:20:08.373,00:20:09.333,Ah!
00:20:09.416,00:20:11.793,"Dad, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything!"
00:20:11.877,00:20:14.463,"Oh! Sorry, sorry. Should I put it back?"
00:20:14.713,00:20:16.590,"Yeah, you probably should..."
00:20:16.673,00:20:18.675,"You look so cool, though."
00:20:20.177,00:20:22.512,Do the hinges hinge? Does it smell like rhino?
00:20:22.721,00:20:24.473,Does it feel like you're impenetrable?
00:20:24.556,00:20:29.311,Does it feel like you could take on a thousand warriors and emerge unscathed?
00:20:29.519,00:20:30.354,Heh.
00:20:30.479,00:20:32.606,"Yeah, it's pretty cool."
00:20:33.065,00:20:33.899,Ooh!
00:20:33.982,00:20:35.859,I wonder what this does. I should pull it.
00:20:46.578,00:20:47.788,I think I just peed a little.
00:20:50.040,00:20:52.960,"Anything else we should try in here, son?"
00:20:53.835,00:20:54.836,Hmm?
00:20:59.466,00:21:00.884,Charge!
00:21:02.344,00:21:04.137,"Faster, faster, faster!"
00:21:04.221,00:21:05.889,Thumb war!
00:21:05.973,00:21:07.349,Reinforcements!
00:21:07.432,00:21:08.892,No fair. No fair.
00:21:10.602,00:21:11.478,Yeah!
00:21:15.440,00:21:16.566,"Whoa, oh, oh..."
00:21:16.733,00:21:18.110,"Here we go! Go, go, go!"
00:21:18.193,00:21:19.695,"Awesome! Faster, faster, faster."
00:21:23.448,00:21:24.533,There you go.
00:21:24.992,00:21:26.994,Dolphin-Style Attack!
00:21:27.077,00:21:29.079,-You got me. -Dolphin-Style Retreat!
00:21:30.747,00:21:32.165,"Go long, son!"
00:21:33.208,00:21:34.293,Whoa!
00:21:34.501,00:21:35.752,I wasn't ready!
00:21:36.503,00:21:38.046,-Coming back at you. -I got it.
00:21:38.130,00:21:39.631,-I'm going high! -There you go.
00:21:40.007,00:21:40.841,"Come on, throw it!"
00:21:42.384,00:21:43.760,I'm coming for you.
00:21:44.177,00:21:45.804,"Bring it on, Master Rhino."
00:21:45.887,00:21:47.597,Here I come!
00:21:50.642,00:21:51.518,Oh...
00:21:55.981,00:21:59.109,I'm gonna get you. I am gonna get you!
00:21:59.192,00:22:01.153,"I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you!"
00:22:01.236,00:22:02.946,I'm gonna get you.
00:22:03.030,00:22:05.073,Who's got you? Who's gonna get you?
00:22:05.240,00:22:07.784,Who's gonna get you? Yeah. Who's gonna get you?
00:22:12.331,00:22:14.041,What? What's wrong?
00:22:20.088,00:22:21.340,Hello.
00:22:22.257,00:22:23.300,"Guys, guys."
00:22:23.383,00:22:25.302,You're never gonna guess who just showed up.
00:22:25.385,00:22:26.720,Not in a million years.
00:22:26.803,00:22:28.638,You... You just try.
00:22:29.806,00:22:31.558,Whoa! How did you just guess that?
00:22:31.850,00:22:32.893,"Oh, wait a second. Yeah, of course."
00:22:32.976,00:22:33.935,We look exactly the same.
00:22:34.019,00:22:35.854,"Dad, say hi to my friends."
00:22:35.979,00:22:39.316,"Mantis, Tigress, Monkey, Crane, and Viper."
00:22:39.399,00:22:41.276,"-Viper, was it? -Monkey, sir."
00:22:41.359,00:22:43.528,They're kind of my best friends. And this...
00:22:43.779,00:22:46.114,This is Master Shifu. Legend.
00:22:46.782,00:22:49.534,"Uh... It is an honor to meet you, Master Panda."
00:22:49.826,00:22:52.913,Perhaps your father would care to join us in the training hall.
00:22:52.996,00:22:54.748,Your son will be teaching the class.
00:22:55.999,00:22:56.917,"Oh, ho, ho!"
00:22:57.000,00:22:59.419,I'm sure he's tired. I'm sure you're tired. He's tired.
00:22:59.503,00:23:00.962,I'm gonna show him to the Chrysanthemum Suite.
00:23:01.046,00:23:02.964,"What, tired? No, I'm fine."
00:23:03.090,00:23:04.591,I would love to watch you teach.
00:23:04.674,00:23:06.301,"Trust me, it'll be more fun just to watch me..."
00:23:08.136,00:23:10.013,-What is that? -the Valley's under attack.
00:23:11.973,00:23:13.308,Son? Under attack?
00:23:13.391,00:23:14.434,This is perfect!
00:23:14.518,00:23:16.978,Now you can see what being the Dragon Warrior's all about!
00:23:17.562,00:23:18.605,Follow me!
00:23:25.654,00:23:29.116,"Enemies of justice, prepare for war!"
00:23:29.199,00:23:30.492,Are you kidding me?
00:23:33.078,00:23:34.037,Ow!
00:23:39.668,00:23:41.419,What's the deal with the green guys?
00:23:42.420,00:23:44.339,Some kind of jade zombies.
00:23:44.422,00:23:45.715,Jade zombies?
00:23:45.799,00:23:47.050,-Jombies! Jinx! -Jombies! Jinx!
00:23:47.134,00:23:48.009,Ow!
00:23:48.885,00:23:50.262,"Lotus, be careful!"
00:23:50.345,00:23:52.097,"It's okay, Dad, I do this every day!"
00:23:54.474,00:23:56.434,Whoa! I recognize these guys.
00:23:56.518,00:23:59.688,"The Master Badger Twins, with their Crushing Double-Gong technique!"
00:23:59.771,00:24:00.981,Ow!
00:24:01.064,00:24:02.732,"Yeah, that's the one!"
00:24:02.983,00:24:05.777,And that guy is... No! Master Porcupine!
00:24:09.614,00:24:11.616,I thought he died a hundred years ago.
00:24:11.700,00:24:13.160,These guys are legend!
00:24:14.035,00:24:15.704,Get a quick sketch of us.
00:24:22.919,00:24:23.962,Did you get it? Did you get it?
00:24:24.629,00:24:25.881,"Oh, I blinked."
00:24:26.214,00:24:27.299,Can we get another one?
00:24:30.594,00:24:33.597,I'm being choked by Master Porcupine. This is so cool.
00:24:35.640,00:24:36.641,Look. It's you!
00:24:36.725,00:24:38.310,"Po, focus!"
00:24:38.518,00:24:40.103,Message from the universe.
00:24:40.187,00:24:42.689,I'll give you a message from the universe.
00:24:42.939,00:24:44.357,Stay away from my son!
00:24:45.567,00:24:46.651,"Sorry, Dad. I'll clean up later."
00:24:46.735,00:24:48.153,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not my good pan!"
00:24:48.445,00:24:49.446,Take this one.
00:24:52.073,00:24:53.491,Lotus! Watch out!
00:24:58.663,00:25:00.540,"Dad, check out my Dumplings of Doom."
00:25:11.843,00:25:12.886,Gotcha.
00:25:17.849,00:25:19.267,I see you.
00:25:20.060,00:25:22.604,Your chi will soon be mine.
00:25:22.687,00:25:23.855,-Is he talking to me? -Which one?
00:25:23.939,00:25:24.856,They're all talking.
00:25:25.023,00:25:26.900,Whoa. You're right. That's so scary.
00:25:27.150,00:25:29.444,"We should try that, too. Maybe it'd be scary back at them."
00:25:29.527,00:25:31.071,"Okay, but we gotta plan what we're gonna say first."
00:25:31.154,00:25:32.989,"Otherwise, it won't be scary. It'll just be stupid."
00:25:33.073,00:25:35.325,"It's not them talking, you idiots!"
00:25:35.492,00:25:37.535,It's me talking through them. Kai!
00:25:37.827,00:25:40.121,"-Who? -Okay, okay, okay. Enough."
00:25:46.920,00:25:48.421,-Did you see that? -What just happened?
00:25:48.505,00:25:50.507,"The green smoke, just poof! And then poof!"
00:25:50.799,00:25:52.259,"Shifu, what was that?"
00:25:52.550,00:25:55.595,Kai... Kai... Kai...
00:25:55.929,00:25:57.222,"Nope, never heard of him."
00:25:57.806,00:25:59.557,Kai... Kai...
00:25:59.849,00:26:00.767,Where is it?
00:26:00.850,00:26:03.103,"There's so much wisdom in here, I can't find anything."
00:26:03.728,00:26:04.646,Yes!
00:26:05.730,00:26:06.856,Behold.
00:26:08.525,00:26:10.485,All the answers will be found within.
00:26:13.029,00:26:14.906,What? It's blank?
00:26:16.032,00:26:18.451,Are you kidding me? Not again.
00:26:20.245,00:26:22.205,"Wait, wait, hold on. Sorry."
00:26:22.497,00:26:24.499,Oh. Okay. Here we go.
00:26:25.625,00:26:27.877,It is written in Oogway's hand.
00:26:28.295,00:26:30.505,"Long ago, I had a brother..."
00:26:30.672,00:26:32.340,Oogway had a brother?
00:26:32.424,00:26:35.802,"in arms. In arms. Sorry. He says, Brother-in-arms."
00:26:35.885,00:26:37.512,Maybe you should just unroll it all at once?
00:26:39.222,00:26:42.851,I was an ambitious young warrior leading a great army.
00:26:45.520,00:26:48.315,And fighting by my side was Kai...
00:26:49.274,00:26:50.984,my closest friend.
00:26:54.112,00:26:56.906,"One day, we were ambushed."
00:26:56.990,00:26:58.908,I was badly wounded.
00:26:59.200,00:27:03.580,"My friend carried me for days, looking for help..."
00:27:04.289,00:27:08.585,until we came to a secret village high in the mountains.
00:27:08.877,00:27:11.629,An ancient place of healing.
00:27:12.172,00:27:14.632,A village of pandas.
00:27:16.634,00:27:18.595,"Yes, pandas."
00:27:19.054,00:27:22.724,Pandas who used the power of chi to heal me.
00:27:26.561,00:27:29.022,They taught me how to give chi.
00:27:33.943,00:27:38.448,But Kai wanted the power all to himself.
00:27:39.491,00:27:44.120,He saw that what could be given could also be taken.
00:27:47.832,00:27:50.001,I had to stop him.
00:27:54.798,00:28:02.555,"Our battle shook the earth until, finally I banished Kai to the Spirit Realm."
00:28:02.931,00:28:09.979,"Should he ever return to the mortal realm, he can only be stopped by a true master of chi."
00:28:10.438,00:28:13.066,True master of chi? Like you!
00:28:13.149,00:28:15.235,Me? I can barely make a flower bloom.
00:28:15.318,00:28:17.695,"I need at least 30 more years, and a cave."
00:28:20.573,00:28:22.659,the chi of masters until he has consumed it all.
00:28:28.790,00:28:30.458,"I can teach you, son."
00:28:32.043,00:28:33.545,You can do this?
00:28:34.379,00:28:36.798,Of course. I'm a panda.
00:28:37.632,00:28:39.968,That must be why the universe sent you here!
00:28:40.760,00:28:42.345,"Okay, so what do I have to do?"
00:28:42.804,00:28:44.472,You have to come home with me.
00:28:44.889,00:28:45.807,What?
00:28:46.057,00:28:47.475,To the secret village?
00:28:47.559,00:28:48.476,"Yes, son."
00:28:48.560,00:28:52.105,You must rediscover what it is to be a panda.
00:28:52.522,00:28:58.111,"You have to learn to live like a panda, sleep like a panda, eat like a panda."
00:29:01.531,00:29:03.283,I was just warming up.
00:29:03.783,00:29:06.828,I've always felt like I wasn't eating up to my full potential.
00:29:07.328,00:29:09.748,"No, you can't take Po away from me. No, no."
00:29:10.165,00:29:11.374,I want a second opinion.
00:29:11.541,00:29:14.210,"Shifu, open another scroll or something."
00:29:14.335,00:29:15.628,I think he should go.
00:29:15.920,00:29:17.422,"Fine, a third opinion."
00:29:17.547,00:29:19.883,Monkey? Viper? Tigress?
00:29:19.966,00:29:22.427,"Dad, you heard what Shifu said Oogway said."
00:29:22.844,00:29:25.555,This guy can only be stopped by a master of chi.
00:29:25.638,00:29:28.349,And I can only master chi by knowing who I really am.
00:29:29.225,00:29:31.227,"Well, I'm a panda."
00:29:35.690,00:29:37.525,I'll pack you a lunch for the road.
00:29:44.199,00:29:47.202,Do you really think Po can master chi in time?
00:29:47.285,00:29:48.912,Doesn't matter what I think.
00:29:48.995,00:29:50.663,It only matters what the universe thinks.
00:29:51.164,00:29:52.999,"So, that's a no?"
00:29:53.082,00:29:54.667,"Master, what are we going to do?"
00:29:54.918,00:29:56.753,You are going to find out where Kai is.
00:29:57.003,00:29:58.922,Follow the trail of those jade creatures.
00:29:59.005,00:30:03.676,"But do not engage for with every foe he faces, Kai becomes stronger."
00:30:03.927,00:30:05.970,Why me? Is it because I asked?
00:30:06.346,00:30:08.598,No. It is because you can fly. Go!
00:30:12.852,00:30:14.437,"What? Oh, man. Is it because I..."
00:30:42.841,00:30:43.716,Lunch break.
00:30:47.178,00:30:48.805,-Dad? -Yes?
00:30:48.888,00:30:51.015,-Dad? -Yes?
00:30:51.099,00:30:52.183,What are you doing here?
00:30:52.433,00:30:54.727,What am I doing? Getting a backache.
00:30:55.061,00:30:56.980,Did you have to step on every rock?
00:30:57.188,00:30:58.898,"No, I mean, why are you here?"
00:30:59.023,00:31:00.692,"What was I supposed to do, huh?"
00:31:00.775,00:31:02.735,What if the pandas don't have food you like?
00:31:02.944,00:31:06.447,You're never gonna be able to save the world on an empty stomach.
00:31:06.865,00:31:09.242,I consider my presence mission critical.
00:31:09.325,00:31:10.827,"Oh. Yes, about that..."
00:31:10.910,00:31:14.664,We can't share the location of the village with others. So...
00:31:15.123,00:31:17.876,"Well, you think I can't keep a secret, huh?"
00:31:18.042,00:31:22.255,I raised Po for 20 years before I finally told him he was adopted.
00:31:22.630,00:31:24.048,-Seriously? -Yeah.
00:31:24.382,00:31:27.218,Okay. I guess it would be cruel to make you fly back.
00:31:29.429,00:31:30.722,You can fly?
00:31:31.055,00:31:32.140,"I'm a bird, Po."
00:31:49.282,00:31:50.199,We're here.
00:31:54.913,00:31:57.540,Sure looks like a long ways up there.
00:31:57.957,00:31:59.876,And my son hates stairs.
00:32:00.084,00:32:01.419,"So, let's go home."
00:32:01.669,00:32:04.088,We're pandas. We don't do stairs.
00:32:04.255,00:32:06.049,I've waited my whole life to hear those words.
00:32:10.094,00:32:10.970,Rats.
00:32:20.772,00:32:22.565,Whoa! Huh?
00:32:34.410,00:32:36.829,This is the secret panda village?
00:32:37.205,00:32:39.457,No wonder you keep it a secret.
00:32:39.540,00:32:41.751,"If I lived here, I wouldn't tell anyone either."
00:32:46.714,00:32:48.424,Now you can Whoa.
00:32:48.633,00:32:50.802,Whoa!
00:32:51.511,00:32:53.846,-Let's go! -Over here! Come on!
00:33:12.949,00:33:14.075,Ooh!
00:33:20.081,00:33:22.709,"-My turn! My turn! -Come on, faster, faster!"
00:33:25.795,00:33:26.671,Li?
00:33:26.754,00:33:28.297,Everyone! Li's back!
00:33:28.506,00:33:30.466,-They're both back! -He found his son!
00:33:30.550,00:33:31.843,-He made it! -They're back!
00:33:31.926,00:33:33.302,-Li? -He found his son!
00:33:33.386,00:33:35.263,Everyone! Li's back!
00:33:35.346,00:33:37.348,"Hang on, we're coming!"
00:33:37.807,00:33:39.183,He made it!
00:33:39.267,00:33:41.019,-They made it! -Why are we running?
00:33:41.477,00:33:43.062,-Here we come! -He's back!
00:33:43.146,00:33:44.939,They made it!
00:33:45.023,00:33:47.400,Li Shan is back!
00:33:56.993,00:33:58.036,Hi!
00:33:58.119,00:33:59.120,Everyone!
00:33:59.203,00:34:01.414,"Everyone, gather around! This is my son!"
00:34:01.497,00:34:03.041,"-Hello, hi. -He's here!"
00:34:03.458,00:34:04.667,You're here! Triplets!
00:34:04.751,00:34:06.169,"Hi, I'm Ku Ku!"
00:34:06.252,00:34:07.420,-I'm Meng Meng. -I'm Shuai Shuai.
00:34:07.587,00:34:09.213,-Your fur is soft. -He smells like cookies.
00:34:09.297,00:34:12.550,"He's so handsome, just like his father."
00:34:12.633,00:34:14.093,Thank you.
00:34:14.177,00:34:16.137,"Son, these are your cousins."
00:34:16.345,00:34:17.388,Dim and Sum.
00:34:17.889,00:34:18.931,I have cousins!
00:34:19.015,00:34:20.183,-Welcome! -Welcome!
00:34:20.266,00:34:21.893,Whoa! Buns on a string.
00:34:21.976,00:34:23.186,We call it a snacklace.
00:34:23.269,00:34:24.270,That's right.
00:34:24.812,00:34:26.189,Ah... We'll make you another one.
00:34:27.815,00:34:28.858,It's you!
00:34:28.941,00:34:31.319,"So...That's nice. Yeah, hi!"
00:34:31.652,00:34:33.404,I don't know who you are.
00:34:33.905,00:34:36.157,Stripy Baby. So beautiful.
00:34:37.742,00:34:39.327,"Okay, careful with that. That's my action figure."
00:34:39.410,00:34:41.287,-Can I keep her? Can I? -No...
00:34:43.456,00:34:45.875,...problem. Of course. Yeah. That's why I brought her.
00:34:50.671,00:34:53.925,"You look just like me, but a baby."
00:34:57.220,00:34:59.263,"You're like me, but old."
00:35:00.181,00:35:02.475,"You're like me, but fatter!"
00:35:03.267,00:35:04.310,"You're like me, but..."
00:35:06.270,00:35:07.396,with a hat.
00:35:08.564,00:35:10.358,He does wear a hat!
00:35:10.483,00:35:11.859,You all look like me.
00:35:13.611,00:35:16.114,Let's feast in my son's honor.
00:35:18.449,00:35:19.367,What the...
00:35:19.450,00:35:22.370,Pandas don't walk. We roll!
00:35:27.416,00:35:29.544,Have you ever seen anyone look so ridiculous?
00:35:31.379,00:35:33.089,"Po, what are you doing? Po!"
00:35:41.472,00:35:42.306,Ah!
00:35:42.390,00:35:43.266,Ooh!
00:35:46.811,00:35:47.645,Ow!
00:35:47.937,00:35:49.730,"You're right, that is better than walking."
00:35:53.818,00:35:55.153,"Yeah, that's the good stuff."
00:35:55.236,00:35:56.445,Have some dumplings.
00:35:56.529,00:35:58.531,What kind of panda doesn't know how to roll?
00:35:58.614,00:36:00.783,"Well, I'm kind of new at this whole being a panda thing."
00:36:00.867,00:36:02.827,"Hey, what kind of panda are you?"
00:36:03.035,00:36:04.453,You have a funny neck.
00:36:04.537,00:36:05.663,I'm not a panda at all.
00:36:05.830,00:36:07.206,-What's that? What's that? -My hat. My beak.
00:36:07.290,00:36:08.291,-What's that? -My wing.
00:36:08.374,00:36:09.917,-What's that? -My dumplings.
00:36:10.168,00:36:12.003,"No more questions! Go away, kid."
00:36:12.211,00:36:13.963,"Here, son. I packed your chopsticks."
00:36:14.046,00:36:14.964,"-Thanks, Dad. -Wow."
00:36:15.047,00:36:17.049,"-Oh, my. -What?"
00:36:17.842,00:36:18.926,What are those for?
00:36:19.093,00:36:21.220,These? These are chopsticks. They're for picking up dumplings.
00:36:21.304,00:36:24.015,You mean you only eat one at a time?
00:36:25.975,00:36:28.186,"-Yummy. -Yeah, yummy."
00:36:30.730,00:36:32.982,I knew I wasn't eating up to my potential!
00:36:41.449,00:36:42.408,Huh?
00:36:47.872,00:36:49.957,I am Mei Mei.
00:36:50.333,00:36:53.461,"Wow, she's amazing. She's so beautiful."
00:36:53.794,00:36:55.087,"That's sweet, Po."
00:36:55.213,00:36:59.091,"But please, try to save all other compliments until after the performance."
00:37:00.968,00:37:02.386,"Me? No, I didn't say..."
00:37:03.888,00:37:05.139,Shut it.
00:37:05.806,00:37:07.058,After the performance.
00:37:07.767,00:37:09.435,Has it started yet?
00:37:12.521,00:37:15.900,Best ribbon dancer in the world!
00:37:16.192,00:37:17.401,"At least, that's what she said."
00:37:17.485,00:37:19.153,Look away. Look away.
00:37:19.237,00:37:21.614,"No. You can't, can you?"
00:37:21.697,00:37:24.825,"Dad, why does she keep staring at me like... that!"
00:37:25.201,00:37:26.452,Try to keep up.
00:37:28.371,00:37:30.039,I don't really know how to dance!
00:37:30.122,00:37:32.917,"Of course, you do. All pandas dance."
00:37:34.293,00:37:36.212,-I know what you were thinking. -You do?
00:37:36.295,00:37:38.798,How can one panda be so beautiful?
00:37:42.385,00:37:43.427,For me?
00:37:44.804,00:37:46.013,"Ooh, oh..."
00:37:46.097,00:37:47.139,Po.
00:37:47.556,00:37:49.350,"-Help me, Dads. -Yeah, no, you're on your own."
00:37:49.433,00:37:50.601,"You're doing great, son."
00:37:52.853,00:37:54.063,Your turn.
00:38:07.201,00:38:08.452,"Yay, Po!"
00:38:10.621,00:38:12.456,Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it.
00:38:14.333,00:38:16.043,I have so much to learn.
00:38:24.677,00:38:26.387,Wings of Surveillance!
00:38:27.138,00:38:28.681,-Why do you do that? -Do what?
00:38:28.764,00:38:32.143,"Just because you say Wings of before something, it doesn't mean that you're doing a special move."
00:38:32.226,00:38:37.648,It's like me saying Antenna of Power or Thorax of Making Sandwiches.
00:38:37.857,00:38:39.233,Wings of Disagreement.
00:38:39.525,00:38:41.068,Huh! There.
00:38:42.320,00:38:45.531,"Master Bear, Master Chicken, Master Croc! What are you doing out here?"
00:38:48.868,00:38:50.369,Stop!
00:38:53.164,00:38:55.041,They must be in there.
00:39:01.672,00:39:02.882,...not to engage.
00:39:02.965,00:39:04.550,-We've gotta get in there. -But Master Shifu said...
00:39:04.633,00:39:05.885,You're seriously afraid?
00:39:05.968,00:39:08.679,Even Master Chicken's going in there! And he's a chicken.
00:39:17.938,00:39:20.524,-That's it. I'm going in. -Mantis! We have orders not to...
00:39:20.608,00:39:23.444,"They need our help! Come on. I'll go high, you go low."
00:39:23.527,00:39:24.612,"No, wait."
00:39:25.279,00:39:26.739,Fear the bug!
00:39:27.073,00:39:28.491,"All right, you little..."
00:39:29.700,00:39:31.160,"Hold on, buddy. I'm coming!"
00:39:31.243,00:39:33.412,Antenna of Power! Ah! It didn't work!
00:39:33.496,00:39:34.455,Mantis!
00:39:39.418,00:39:40.419,Mantis?
00:39:42.046,00:39:43.714,Mantis.
00:39:56.060,00:39:57.603,Your chi is strong.
00:39:58.646,00:39:59.980,Just like your friend...
00:40:00.564,00:40:01.690,the bug.
00:40:12.493,00:40:13.702,"Don't worry, little birdie."
00:40:14.870,00:40:16.705,I'll put your chi to good use...
00:40:17.957,00:40:21.710,destroying the Jade Palace and everyone in it.
00:40:22.711,00:40:23.587,No!
00:40:30.511,00:40:32.596,Wings of Regret!
00:40:40.563,00:40:42.898,"Oh, yeah. First day of panda training!"
00:40:42.982,00:40:44.150,"All right, flower."
00:40:44.775,00:40:46.735,I'm gonna make you bloom.
00:40:47.361,00:40:48.362,Woohoo!
00:40:49.405,00:40:51.615,-Dad. Dad. -What? What? What is it?
00:40:51.699,00:40:53.284,I'm ready for my first day of panda training.
00:40:53.367,00:40:56.745,"-What? -You know, learn to be a panda, master chi, save the world!"
00:40:56.829,00:40:58.998,Pandas sleep till past noon.
00:40:59.081,00:41:01.792,"So lesson number one is, Go back to bed."
00:41:02.918,00:41:04.044,Of course!
00:41:07.089,00:41:08.591,Nobody said this was gonna be easy.
00:41:16.474,00:41:18.225,-You sure did. -Yes!
00:41:18.350,00:41:19.727,"Yeah! Show him, kids!"
00:41:19.894,00:41:21.604,Can you do this? Can you do that?
00:41:21.729,00:41:22.938,How about this? How about that?
00:41:23.022,00:41:24.732,Am I doing it? Is this good?
00:41:24.940,00:41:26.567,I got it! Ka-blam!
00:41:28.694,00:41:29.987,"-Grandma Panda, heads up! -Hello! Ow..."
00:41:30.613,00:41:31.530,Ooh...
00:41:31.614,00:41:32.656,We better roll.
00:41:33.491,00:41:35.409,"Po, lunchtime."
00:41:43.709,00:41:45.711,You gotta let the hill tell you where to roll.
00:41:45.794,00:41:47.171,Ah... Rookie mistake.
00:41:47.379,00:41:50.257,"Dim, Sum, let's show him how we go uphill!"
00:41:52.801,00:41:53.969,It's beautiful.
00:41:54.303,00:41:56.597,Snack time. Po!
00:41:56.680,00:41:58.224,You can fly?
00:42:01.352,00:42:02.895,Get them while they're cold.
00:42:05.564,00:42:08.275,What are you doing there? That food is for Po!
00:42:08.359,00:42:09.527,Throw it in!
00:42:12.238,00:42:14.865,"There, there. That's it."
00:42:14.949,00:42:17.159,-Feeling relaxed? -Totally.
00:42:17.243,00:42:19.662,Just let yourself fall into it.
00:42:19.745,00:42:20.788,Got it.
00:42:26.710,00:42:28.963,There we go. Just let it all out.
00:42:29.255,00:42:30.464,That's my boy.
00:42:32.841,00:42:33.759,Get out of there!
00:42:36.470,00:42:37.721,My noodles!
00:42:37.805,00:42:39.056,Leave my noodles alone.
00:42:43.435,00:42:45.062,"Subtle, Po. Very subtle."
00:42:45.145,00:42:46.730,Let me get some of that.
00:42:48.691,00:42:50.150,"Hey, leave my hat alone!"
00:42:54.029,00:42:57.074,We love noodles! More noodles!
00:42:57.157,00:42:58.659,Just like my Po.
00:43:03.789,00:43:05.165,What are you guys looking at?
00:43:11.880,00:43:14.550,That's how we roll! Cannonball!
00:43:28.105,00:43:29.857,"Here, bring it up here."
00:43:29.940,00:43:30.858,"Mom, look it!"
00:43:37.114,00:43:38.115,How was that?
00:43:42.494,00:43:43.871,Whoa!
00:43:43.954,00:43:47.082,"Now, you try again. But don't try so hard."
00:43:47.249,00:43:48.542,Okay. Okay.
00:43:53.881,00:43:55.549,Much better.
00:44:03.807,00:44:04.642,"Thanks, Dad."
00:44:05.309,00:44:06.310,For what?
00:44:06.518,00:44:12.441,"You know, just for, you know, showing me what it feels like to be a panda."
00:44:13.984,00:44:16.862,"-So, when do you think I'll be ready? -Ready?"
00:44:16.945,00:44:18.781,"You know, to learn how to master chi."
00:44:19.448,00:44:20.949,Soon. Real soon.
00:44:21.784,00:44:24.286,"Come on, I wanna show you something else. Come on."
00:44:27.915,00:44:31.168,Sorry about the mess. I don't usually get visitors.
00:44:42.054,00:44:44.640,Is this my mom?
00:44:50.479,00:44:53.357,I had this done on your 100th day.
00:44:56.193,00:44:57.903,Your momma couldn't hold you still.
00:45:02.449,00:45:03.409,It's true.
00:45:03.700,00:45:04.785,What was she like?
00:45:05.411,00:45:06.453,Oh...
00:45:07.121,00:45:09.832,She was the total package.
00:45:11.458,00:45:13.919,"Smart, beautiful..."
00:45:14.795,00:45:16.338,tremendous appetite.
00:45:17.923,00:45:19.800,She was the love of my life.
00:45:20.676,00:45:27.766,"And then, just when I thought I couldn't get any luckier, along you came. My Little Lotus."
00:45:30.978,00:45:32.563,I really had it all...
00:45:34.481,00:45:38.402,until that one moment...
00:45:41.989,00:45:45.993,when I lost everything.
00:46:23.572,00:46:24.615,Dad.
00:46:25.282,00:46:27.618,You don't have to worry about losing me ever again.
00:46:29.244,00:46:30.245,Okay?
00:46:39.379,00:46:40.797,Let me get some of that.
00:46:50.516,00:46:52.392,It's from the Eastern Province!
00:46:54.019,00:46:58.982,"Master Lizard, Master Ox, Master Eagle. All of them."
00:46:59.983,00:47:03.904,"In every village from the sea to here, every master in China..."
00:47:04.780,00:47:05.822,has vanished.
00:47:05.989,00:47:08.283,-Maybe they are all at a party. -Monkey.
00:47:08.367,00:47:09.618,I didn't get invited either.
00:47:09.910,00:47:12.120,Kai has taken their chi.
00:47:12.204,00:47:14.206,We are all that stand between him...
00:47:14.790,00:47:17.918,and the knowledge Oogway left in our care.
00:47:19.044,00:47:20.796,"The villagers, evacuated?"
00:47:20.879,00:47:21.713,"Done, Master."
00:47:22.214,00:47:23.966,"-Crane, Mantis? -Still nothing."
00:47:30.430,00:47:31.265,No!
00:47:45.404,00:47:46.321,Kai.
00:47:51.785,00:47:52.953,Nice.
00:47:53.203,00:47:54.329,Very tacky.
00:47:55.831,00:47:58.083,How dare you set foot on these grounds!
00:47:58.333,00:48:00.544,Look at you pathetic fools.
00:48:01.211,00:48:04.881,Groveling at the feet of Oogway the Magnificent.
00:48:05.257,00:48:07.050,You are not fit to speak his name.
00:48:07.551,00:48:09.720,"I am not fit, little kitten?"
00:48:11.930,00:48:14.474,I fought by his side.
00:48:14.558,00:48:17.060,I loved him like a brother.
00:48:17.352,00:48:20.814,And he betrayed me.
00:48:22.274,00:48:23.358,Well...
00:48:24.151,00:48:28.447,Now I will destroy everything he has created!
00:48:29.448,00:48:30.782,Go!
00:48:52.095,00:48:53.639,How's that for a little kitten?
00:49:10.405,00:49:12.866,I will not let you destroy Oogway's memory.
00:49:13.075,00:49:15.327,Why not? He destroyed mine.
00:49:15.952,00:49:19.081,"Mantis. It is me, your bestie!"
00:49:24.252,00:49:25.379,"Sorry, Tigress!"
00:49:25.462,00:49:27.964,Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
00:49:28.048,00:49:28.924,Sorry!
00:49:43.271,00:49:44.106,Shifu.
00:49:44.648,00:49:45.774,Bring them to me.
00:49:56.618,00:49:57.452,No.
00:49:57.536,00:49:59.454,"-You must warn Po. -Master, please."
00:50:08.088,00:50:11.925,"I will show you the true power of chi, brother."
00:50:14.177,00:50:15.053,No!
00:50:51.131,00:50:53.925,"Oogway, forgive me."
00:50:58.013,00:50:59.264,Do you forgive him?
00:51:00.098,00:51:05.854,"You may have destroyed the Jade Palace, but you will never succeed."
00:51:05.937,00:51:09.733,There will always be someone to stop you.
00:51:09.941,00:51:11.443,Who? The panda?
00:51:11.943,00:51:16.156,His chi is strong... but it won't be enough.
00:51:16.907,00:51:21.036,He will meet the same fate as you.
00:51:21.203,00:51:24.915,-No. -And so will every panda in that village.
00:51:31.588,00:51:32.881,Yes.
00:51:37.511,00:51:39.471,"Po, I hope you're ready."
00:51:43.850,00:51:45.435,"Dance, Lotus. Dance."
00:51:47.437,00:51:48.980,He's so handsome.
00:51:50.607,00:51:51.525,Hi!
00:51:52.359,00:51:54.027,That's a panda hug!
00:51:54.361,00:51:55.612,Hey.
00:52:00.575,00:52:01.451,Po.
00:52:42.784,00:52:43.660,Who's she?
00:52:43.952,00:52:44.870,Who is that?
00:52:47.330,00:52:48.915,Big Stripy Baby!
00:52:50.292,00:52:51.334,What are you doing here?
00:52:51.418,00:52:53.086,Kai attacked the Valley.
00:52:53.211,00:52:56.047,"He's taken every master in China, including Shifu and the others."
00:52:56.506,00:52:58.800,"It's all gone, Po. Everything. Everyone."
00:52:59.259,00:53:00.260,Everyone?
00:53:00.343,00:53:01.303,Everyone.
00:53:01.720,00:53:03.263,How's my restaurant?
00:53:05.265,00:53:06.266,We'll talk later.
00:53:06.474,00:53:09.728,"And now he's on his way here. He's after you, Po."
00:53:10.270,00:53:11.730,He's after all pandas.
00:53:12.522,00:53:14.691,-How long do we have? -Not long.
00:53:14.941,00:53:17.027,"Please, tell me you've mastered chi."
00:53:17.110,00:53:18.486,"-Here, take the baby. -Dad! Dad!"
00:53:18.570,00:53:19.738,"Okay, who belongs to this one?"
00:53:19.821,00:53:21.865,You need to teach me the secret chi technique now!
00:53:21.948,00:53:24.242,"No, no, I'm afraid you need more time."
00:53:24.326,00:53:26.202,"Everyone, go get your things! Let me help you with that."
00:53:26.286,00:53:28.163,I don't have more time. I need to learn it now!
00:53:28.246,00:53:30.123,"Sorry, you're not ready."
00:53:30.206,00:53:31.666,"Okay, pack everything!"
00:53:32.000,00:53:33.168,-I am ready. -Not quite.
00:53:33.251,00:53:35.337,What are you talking about? I've done everything you've asked.
00:53:35.587,00:53:38.798,"I've mastered napping, sleeping in, hammocks, hot tubs."
00:53:38.965,00:53:42.010,I am totally at one with my panda parts. Now why won't you show me?
00:53:42.093,00:53:43.845,Because I don't know it!
00:53:47.766,00:53:50.936,"-You what? -I don't know it, okay? No one does."
00:53:51.144,00:53:54.272,Maybe we used to. But... But not anymore.
00:53:55.315,00:53:57.150,"-You lied? -No, I..."
00:53:59.235,00:54:00.278,Yes.
00:54:00.820,00:54:02.906,Why?
00:54:02.989,00:54:04.574,To save your life!
00:54:04.783,00:54:08.203,I find out some blade-swinging maniac is coming for you.
00:54:08.286,00:54:11.373,What am I supposed to do? Just let that happen?
00:54:11.665,00:54:16.252,"Yes! I'm the Dragon Warrior. Facing maniacs, that's my job!"
00:54:16.336,00:54:19.214,"But because of you, I left the Valley unprotected."
00:54:19.464,00:54:22.550,I left my friends unprotected! And now they're all...
00:54:23.426,00:54:25.929,"-They're all... -And you would have been, too."
00:54:28.056,00:54:29.724,I lost you once.
00:54:30.141,00:54:31.977,I am not going to lose you again.
00:54:33.353,00:54:35.105,I can't.
00:54:41.027,00:54:42.404,You just did.
00:54:53.748,00:54:54.874,Mom! Pick me!
00:55:02.757,00:55:06.845,"Po, I'm so worried for you that I can't even enjoy being right about everything."
00:55:06.970,00:55:09.848,"Now run, run, run, as fast as those chubby legs can go!"
00:55:10.015,00:55:11.599,Run? There's nowhere to run.
00:55:11.766,00:55:13.268,But what are you going to do?
00:55:13.476,00:55:16.146,"I'm gonna stay, and fight that monster."
00:55:16.312,00:55:19.399,"Po, he may be a monster, but he's still your father."
00:55:19.941,00:55:21.276,Not him. Kai!
00:56:08.073,00:56:09.074,Hungry?
00:56:09.199,00:56:11.117,"No, I... Not really."
00:56:11.910,00:56:13.495,"Well, maybe just one."
00:56:14.829,00:56:18.625,"You know, you weren't the only one who was lying."
00:56:19.000,00:56:24.089,-Oh? -I didn't really come along because I was worried Po would go hungry.
00:56:24.547,00:56:26.466,I was worried about you.
00:56:26.549,00:56:27.967,Worried that I'd go hungry?
00:56:28.051,00:56:29.135,No.
00:56:29.385,00:56:31.596,I was worried you'd steal Po from me.
00:56:32.013,00:56:35.391,-I'd what? -I know. That was crazy.
00:56:36.351,00:56:41.773,But I realize having you in Po's life doesn't mean less for me.
00:56:42.148,00:56:44.025,It means more for Po.
00:56:46.277,00:56:49.239,"Well, I'm not in his life."
00:56:50.156,00:56:51.658,Not anymore.
00:56:51.866,00:56:53.618,Your son got mad at you.
00:56:54.035,00:56:55.495,Welcome to parenthood.
00:56:55.662,00:56:58.581,You don't understand. I lied to him.
00:56:59.165,00:57:00.458,He'll never forgive me.
00:57:00.834,00:57:03.169,I lied to him for 20 years.
00:57:03.253,00:57:05.130,He still thinks he came from an egg.
00:57:06.131,00:57:10.093,"Sometimes, we do the wrong things for the right reasons."
00:57:18.852,00:57:19.894,Look.
00:57:19.978,00:57:21.312,He's hurt.
00:57:21.771,00:57:22.939,He's confused.
00:57:23.857,00:57:26.067,And he still has to save the world.
00:57:27.277,00:57:29.863,He needs both his dads.
00:57:48.506,00:57:50.800,-This isn't going to work. -It has to.
00:57:51.217,00:57:52.218,You're not thinking straight.
00:57:52.343,00:57:53.720,-I am! -You're not.
00:57:53.803,00:57:54.721,-I am! -No.
00:57:54.804,00:57:55.889,"-Yes, I am. -No."
00:57:56.848,00:57:59.559,I've seen Kai. I've seen what he can do.
00:57:59.767,00:58:01.811,But he hasn't seen what I can do.
00:58:06.065,00:58:07.108,The Wuxi Finger Hold?
00:58:08.318,00:58:13.448,"It's my best move. I just have to get to Kai, grab his finger and then skadoosh! Back to the Spirit Realm."
00:58:13.865,00:58:15.533,He has an army of jade warriors.
00:58:15.825,00:58:19.120,"Everything they see, he sees. So there's no sneaking up on him."
00:58:19.204,00:58:21.623,-You will never get close enough. -It's gonna work!
00:58:24.209,00:58:27.003,He can only be stopped by a master of chi.
00:58:27.086,00:58:29.380,"Oh, you sound just like Shifu with the, Chi, chi, chi."
00:58:29.464,00:58:31.049,"Chi this. Chi that. Chi, chi, chi!"
00:58:31.216,00:58:33.510,"I'm not a master of chi, okay?"
00:58:33.635,00:58:36.638,I don't know if I'm the Dragon Warrior. I don't even know if I'm a panda!
00:58:36.721,00:58:38.014,I don't know who I am!
00:58:40.892,00:58:41.935,You're right.
00:58:42.143,00:58:43.811,There's no way I can stop him and his army.
00:58:48.566,00:58:50.610,Unless you had an army of your own.
00:58:54.531,00:58:55.406,You?
00:58:55.657,00:58:57.033,Not just me.
00:58:57.742,00:58:58.910,Us.
00:58:59.160,00:59:00.203,All of us.
00:59:10.004,00:59:13.550,"I finally found my son, after all these years."
00:59:14.551,00:59:18.137,It's going to take a lot more than the end of the world to keep us apart.
00:59:18.388,00:59:20.098,But you don't even know kung fu.
00:59:20.557,00:59:22.350,Then you will teach us.
00:59:22.559,00:59:25.436,What? I can't teach you kung fu.
00:59:25.603,00:59:29.899,I couldn't even teach Tigress. And she already knows kung fu!
00:59:31.359,00:59:36.406,"Po, I know I'm the last guy you wanna trust right now."
00:59:37.073,00:59:40.201,But you gotta believe me. We can do this.
00:59:40.535,00:59:42.579,We can learn kung fu.
00:59:42.662,00:59:44.956,We can be just like you!
00:59:46.291,00:59:47.667,What did you just say?
00:59:47.750,00:59:49.919,-Uh... We can do this? -No!
00:59:50.169,00:59:51.879,-We can learn kung fu? -After that!
00:59:52.589,00:59:53.798,Uh... We can be just like you?
00:59:53.881,00:59:55.008,-Yes! -We can?
00:59:58.386,00:59:59.762,But you don't have to be!
01:00:00.888,01:00:02.056,That's what Shifu meant.
01:00:02.390,01:00:04.017,I don't have to turn you into me.
01:00:04.100,01:00:05.768,I have to turn you into you!
01:00:06.769,01:00:08.187,That doesn't make any sense.
01:00:08.271,01:00:09.439,I know!
01:00:13.526,01:00:16.070,I'm gonna do something I never thought I'd be able to do.
01:00:16.362,01:00:18.197,I'm gonna teach kung fu.
01:00:21.034,01:00:24.454,"You guys, your real strength comes from being the best you you can be."
01:00:24.537,01:00:25.747,So who are you?
01:00:25.830,01:00:27.081,What are you good at?
01:00:27.290,01:00:28.625,What do you love?
01:00:28.875,01:00:30.918,"What makes you, you?"
01:00:32.420,01:00:35.381,"Yes, good. Good. Again."
01:00:38.676,01:00:39.886,Good. Again.
01:00:41.012,01:00:42.180,"Good, good, good. Again."
01:00:42.722,01:00:43.723,Huh?
01:00:44.182,01:00:46.476,Stripy Baby! Stripy Baby!
01:00:47.977,01:00:49.854,"Faster, faster! Twirl those ribbons!"
01:00:50.271,01:00:51.606,"Hug that log, you!"
01:00:51.689,01:00:55.401,Hug that log like it's the last time you're ever gonna hug it goodbye forever.
01:00:55.526,01:00:57.362,Higher! And a little more to the left this time.
01:00:57.612,01:00:58.571,You can do it!
01:01:01.366,01:01:03.117,I don't wanna see any of these hit the ground!
01:01:15.088,01:01:16.964,"Wait, wait, Stripy Baby!"
01:01:21.636,01:01:23.763,Now try it with these!
01:01:28.101,01:01:30.103,Good! Now try it with these.
01:01:33.856,01:01:35.066,-Ow! -Ooh.
01:01:36.067,01:01:37.026,Ow!
01:02:04.762,01:02:06.055,They are ready.
01:02:08.891,01:02:10.017,What?
01:02:10.810,01:02:13.896,"Okay, pay attention because I'm only gonna go over this ten more times."
01:02:14.605,01:02:16.816,The only entrance to the village is here.
01:02:17.400,01:02:22.029,"The dumpling squadron will take position here, while the cookie squadron will take position here."
01:02:22.196,01:02:24.615,"Now, on my signal, the two squadrons will..."
01:02:29.287,01:02:30.496,The noodle squadron will...
01:02:36.002,01:02:39.589,"Okay. Anyway, the important thing to remember is that this is the spot where..."
01:02:42.550,01:02:44.385,"Okay, I saw that coming."
01:02:44.469,01:02:50.057,"If you only remember one thing, it's distract the jombies until I get close enough to put a Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai."
01:02:50.558,01:02:52.018,-You got it? -Yeah!
01:02:53.311,01:02:55.521,"Pandas on three! One, two three, Pan..."
01:02:55.605,01:02:58.483,"You guys... Never mind, I'll teach you that later."
01:03:34.477,01:03:37.438,"I wish I could have taught you this, son."
01:03:37.688,01:03:39.398,"It's okay, Dad. I'm..."
01:03:46.030,01:03:47.532,He's here.
01:04:12.390,01:04:13.975,Wow!
01:04:14.559,01:04:16.310,That's what I call a Dramatic Entrance!
01:04:20.690,01:04:23.651,Ha ha! You must be the Dragon Warrior.
01:04:23.901,01:04:26.404,And you must be Kai!
01:04:26.904,01:04:28.990,"Beast of Vengeance, Maker of Widows!"
01:04:30.241,01:04:33.661,Yes! Finally! Thank you!
01:04:33.786,01:04:35.788,Almost makes me wanna spare your life.
01:04:35.872,01:04:37.206,You wanna spare me?
01:04:37.290,01:04:39.250,How about you spare me the chit-chat?
01:04:39.500,01:04:41.252,All right? Let's do this.
01:04:41.502,01:04:46.215,"I'm going to take your chi, then the chi of every panda in the..."
01:04:47.842,01:04:49.343,-In this... -Chitty-chitty chat-chat.
01:04:49.427,01:04:50.970,"-In... -Chat, chat, chat."
01:04:51.470,01:04:52.597,-In the... -Chit-chat!
01:04:59.854,01:05:01.439,Round them all up.
01:05:16.037,01:05:17.496,"Oh, no. It's true."
01:05:17.705,01:05:19.790,You guys have all been turned green!
01:05:19.957,01:05:22.168,"Except for you, Mantis. You were already green."
01:05:24.712,01:05:25.922,-Now? -Wait for the signal.
01:05:28.549,01:05:29.717,Here we go!
01:05:40.519,01:05:41.687,Dumpling Squad!
01:05:42.313,01:05:43.564,-Ready? -Go time!
01:05:43.940,01:05:45.441,-Belly! -Gong!
01:05:49.070,01:05:50.363,Seriously?
01:05:50.446,01:05:51.447,Yeah! We did it!
01:05:52.531,01:05:53.699,"Sorry, Crane."
01:06:01.999,01:06:04.335,Spring Roll Squad! Time for some takeout!
01:06:12.385,01:06:14.428,"Yoo-hoo! Over here, Mr. Jombie!"
01:06:20.393,01:06:21.978,"I don't know who you are, either."
01:06:22.853,01:06:23.980,Noodle Squad!
01:06:27.358,01:06:30.528,Get ready to dance... with danger!
01:06:35.199,01:06:36.325,Sweet!
01:06:47.795,01:06:49.255,Stripy Baby!
01:06:49.338,01:06:50.423,No.
01:06:54.552,01:06:55.720,-Do it. -You're mean!
01:07:01.892,01:07:03.144,Fire!
01:07:11.569,01:07:12.570,Yes!
01:07:12.653,01:07:14.405,"All right, kids!"
01:07:14.697,01:07:15.698,"You got it, guys!"
01:07:19.660,01:07:21.370,"Oh, no! Master Shifu!"
01:07:22.538,01:07:23.914,I can't hit Shifu!
01:07:26.167,01:07:27.084,I can!
01:07:27.209,01:07:28.836,And so can I.
01:07:30.546,01:07:32.339,-Double-Dad Defense! -Double-Dad Defense!
01:07:32.423,01:07:33.549,"-Left, Dad! -Right, Dad!"
01:07:33.632,01:07:34.800,"Thanks, Dad!"
01:07:34.884,01:07:36.093,"Back at you, Dad."
01:07:36.594,01:07:38.054,"We've got this, son!"
01:07:38.679,01:07:40.598,"-Go, Dads! -Yeah!"
01:07:44.351,01:07:45.811,Yeah!
01:07:45.895,01:07:47.021,We got them now.
01:07:48.147,01:07:50.566,Stop. Stop! Enough!
01:07:52.234,01:07:53.652,Get out...
01:07:57.448,01:07:59.033,Let's finish this.
01:08:17.843,01:08:20.846,"Sorry, buddy. Gotta send you back to the Spirit Realm."
01:08:20.971,01:08:22.139,Skadoosh!
01:08:24.225,01:08:26.977,"Okay, that didn't work. Let me try one more time."
01:08:27.103,01:08:30.523,Skadoosh! Skadoosh. Skadoosh. Skadoo... What the...
01:08:30.815,01:08:32.608,"Hold on, wait! It's working."
01:08:32.942,01:08:34.944,No. No!
01:08:41.909,01:08:43.369,Did Oogway teach you that little trick?
01:08:44.411,01:08:45.579,Too bad.
01:08:45.663,01:08:47.832,It only works on mortals.
01:08:47.915,01:08:51.418,And I am a Spirit Warrior.
01:08:51.585,01:08:52.503,Come!
01:09:38.340,01:09:39.258,Son!
01:09:39.800,01:09:40.968,Po!
01:09:43.345,01:09:44.680,I was wrong.
01:09:44.972,01:09:47.183,I'm sorry. Run. Run!
01:09:59.695,01:10:05.117,"So, Oogway, this was the one destined to stop me?"
01:10:05.492,01:10:07.328,I will have his chi...
01:10:08.037,01:10:10.331,and then all of theirs!
01:10:25.804,01:10:27.806,And you...
01:10:29.058,01:10:33.270,You really thought you could send me back to the Spirit Realm?
01:10:39.360,01:10:41.237,You are just a stupid mortal.
01:10:42.821,01:10:44.698,It only works on mortals.
01:10:47.368,01:10:49.245,You're right. I can't send you there.
01:10:50.913,01:10:52.456,But I can take you there.
01:10:52.831,01:10:53.791,What's that?
01:10:55.709,01:10:57.378,-What? -Po!
01:10:57.461,01:10:58.545,Son!
01:10:58.712,01:11:00.089,Skadoosh.
01:11:00.589,01:11:01.757,Son!
01:11:02.341,01:11:03.634,No!
01:11:25.531,01:11:26.824,What happened?
01:11:26.907,01:11:27.908,Where's Po?
01:11:28.701,01:11:31.412,He took Kai away. He saved us.
01:11:31.912,01:11:33.122,No...
01:11:34.957,01:11:37.501,"He saved us, but who's saving him?"
01:11:42.715,01:11:43.882,Whoa!
01:11:43.966,01:11:46.176,The Spirit Realm. It worked!
01:11:49.179,01:11:51.890,You brought me back?
01:11:52.057,01:11:54.560,Don't blame me. I tried to finish this in the regular realm.
01:11:54.768,01:11:56.562,Then we'll finish it here!
01:12:30.429,01:12:33.349,"Come on, son. Fight!"
01:12:40.647,01:12:41.857,We have to help him.
01:12:43.025,01:12:45.819,We have to help him! Okay. Everyone gather around.
01:12:45.903,01:12:47.696,That's it. Come in close. Come on.
01:12:47.863,01:12:49.406,We can do this.
01:12:58.957,01:13:01.835,You taught us who we were meant to be.
01:13:05.881,01:13:07.257,A father.
01:13:11.428,01:13:12.513,A friend.
01:13:13.430,01:13:14.848,A dumpling kicker.
01:13:14.932,01:13:16.392,A lethal fighting machine.
01:13:16.475,01:13:17.476,A hugger.
01:13:19.686,01:13:21.313,A nunchuck chick.
01:13:21.814,01:13:23.565,Stripy Baby.
01:13:25.150,01:13:26.527,A family.
01:13:56.515,01:13:57.766,Sweet!
01:14:06.108,01:14:07.568,Whoa...
01:14:13.198,01:14:14.366,Who are you?
01:14:14.908,01:14:16.660,I've been asking the same question.
01:14:21.623,01:14:23.041,Am I the son of a panda?
01:14:23.876,01:14:25.294,The son of a goose?
01:14:25.544,01:14:26.420,A student?
01:14:27.504,01:14:28.755,A teacher?
01:14:29.965,01:14:31.049,Turns out...
01:14:32.009,01:14:33.051,I'm all of them.
01:14:41.977,01:14:45.230,I am the Dragon Warrior.
01:14:46.356,01:14:48.567,Get it? See the giant dragon?
01:14:50.319,01:14:52.321,Get ready to feel the thunder.
01:14:53.030,01:14:54.490,This is awesome!
01:15:01.288,01:15:02.664,Woohoo!
01:15:13.175,01:15:14.009,Uh-oh.
01:15:20.724,01:15:21.767,Belly Gong.
01:15:23.268,01:15:24.478,Butt Slap.
01:15:27.606,01:15:28.690,Perhaps a bit of lunch.
01:15:29.107,01:15:30.359,Because I'm starving.
01:15:34.029,01:15:35.030,Mmm.
01:15:50.087,01:15:51.088,Let's do this!
01:15:55.717,01:15:56.802,Heads up!
01:16:11.400,01:16:15.779,It took me 500 years to take Oogway's chi.
01:16:15.904,01:16:19.157,I will have yours if it takes me 500 more.
01:16:19.366,01:16:22.077,Chitty-chitty chat-chat. Chit-chat.
01:16:32.963,01:16:34.631,You want my chi so bad...
01:16:35.465,01:16:36.633,then take it.
01:16:43.515,01:16:47.603,Yes. The power is mine.
01:16:50.147,01:16:52.774,Wait. No. It's too much.
01:16:52.858,01:16:54.693,That's too much! No!
01:16:59.072,01:17:00.616,No!
01:17:12.628,01:17:14.046,Where did he go?
01:17:22.512,01:17:24.264,-We're back! -Bestie!
01:17:24.431,01:17:26.266,I'm still green! It didn't work!
01:17:26.683,01:17:28.060,"Oh, wait. That's my normal green."
01:17:28.685,01:17:29.853,Greeny Baby!
01:17:29.936,01:17:31.730,Not a baby. Not a baby!
01:17:32.064,01:17:33.023,Antenna of Fear!
01:17:34.024,01:17:34.983,What about Po?
01:17:35.150,01:17:36.151,Have you seen Po?
01:17:36.234,01:17:37.694,No. He's not here?
01:17:38.779,01:17:40.364,Po? Po?
01:17:41.448,01:17:43.116,Why isn't he back?
01:17:53.669,01:17:55.462,Dragon Warrior.
01:18:03.762,01:18:05.263,You are extra shiny.
01:18:05.430,01:18:06.390,As are you.
01:18:06.473,01:18:08.350,"I know, right? It's like the best cape ever."
01:18:08.684,01:18:10.686,"When I run with it, then it looks really cool."
01:18:11.019,01:18:13.105,It suits you. You've grown.
01:18:13.188,01:18:15.190,Yep. I gotta lay off the panda buffet.
01:18:15.273,01:18:16.983,Grown up...
01:18:18.026,01:18:22.072,as I hoped you would when I sent the message to your father.
01:18:25.992,01:18:27.327,Yes.
01:18:27.536,01:18:29.746,Because the universe needed you.
01:18:30.205,01:18:31.748,Me?
01:18:32.582,01:18:36.753,You finally became the panda you were always meant to be.
01:18:37.170,01:18:39.089,"But, how'd you know I could?"
01:18:39.381,01:18:44.928,"On the first day we met, I saw the future of kung fu."
01:18:47.806,01:18:49.433,And the past.
01:18:52.310,01:18:55.480,I saw the panda who could unite them both.
01:18:56.440,01:18:58.483,"That is why I chose you, Po."
01:18:59.526,01:19:02.195,Both sides of a Yin and Yang.
01:19:03.071,01:19:06.658,And my true successor.
01:19:09.786,01:19:12.164,Me? I can't take that.
01:19:12.414,01:19:13.957,Just take it.
01:19:14.291,01:19:15.500,I have a bigger one.
01:19:17.544,01:19:20.338,"I mean, you're enlightened and everything. I'm just..."
01:19:21.673,01:19:22.674,Oh...
01:19:23.133,01:19:24.092,Really?
01:19:24.176,01:19:25.385,Yes.
01:19:36.062,01:19:36.980,Now what do we do?
01:19:38.231,01:19:39.608,You tell me.
01:19:40.525,01:19:42.569,"No. Oogway, don't go!"
01:19:42.652,01:19:45.947,I'm not going anywhere. I live here.
01:19:46.573,01:19:48.241,"Oh, right."
01:19:48.700,01:19:51.995,It's you who must decide whether to stay or go.
01:19:52.829,01:19:54.539,Wait. I can go back?
01:19:55.040,01:19:57.542,Who knows? I've never tried.
01:20:12.140,01:20:13.141,Wow.
01:20:24.778,01:20:26.112,Po!
01:20:26.655,01:20:28.490,You can fly!
01:20:34.579,01:20:35.831,Dad. Dad.
01:20:36.373,01:20:37.499,Dads!
01:20:37.666,01:20:38.500,Son!
01:20:41.545,01:20:44.339,Don't you go disappearing in petals ever again.
01:20:44.422,01:20:45.966,We thought we lost you.
01:20:46.132,01:20:47.634,"No, you saved me."
01:20:49.094,01:20:50.554,You all did.
01:20:52.472,01:20:54.432,"Now, come on over here!"
01:20:55.225,01:20:56.726,Hugs!
01:20:59.563,01:21:01.314,Master Shifu!
01:21:01.398,01:21:04.317,The student has truly become the tea...
01:21:04.401,01:21:05.861,Wait. Where did you get that?
01:21:06.027,01:21:08.780,"Oh, this. Oogway gave it to me in the Spirit Realm."
01:21:11.449,01:21:13.118,I think I mastered chi.
01:21:15.370,01:21:16.997,"Of course, you did."
01:21:18.456,01:21:20.375,Can you teach me?
01:21:23.712,01:21:24.963,Ready!
01:21:45.609,01:21:46.484,Whoa...
01:21:53.241,01:21:54.451,"Monkey, help me!"
01:21:54.576,01:21:56.244,Greeny Baby!
01:21:56.369,01:21:57.996,Get 'em off me!
01:22:04.461,01:22:05.795,Mmm. Hello.
01:22:16.556,01:22:17.557,Skadoosh.
01:22:25.440,01:22:27.108,Panda asthma.
