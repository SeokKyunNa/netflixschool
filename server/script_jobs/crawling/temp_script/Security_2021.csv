01:57:48.791,00:01:09.666,Subtitle Translation by Andrea Coppola NETFLIX PRESENTS They told me Forte dei Marmi was a fancy beach town.
00:01:10.416,00:01:11.375,Indeed.
00:01:12.125,00:01:14.458,It was like stepping inside a postcard.
00:01:15.125,00:01:18.083,Where everything looked perfectly staged.
00:01:25.916,00:01:29.833,The white and blue curtains of the beach clubs.
00:01:32.333,00:01:33.750,The raked sand.
00:01:35.625,00:01:38.375,The sound of laughter carried by the breeze.
00:01:39.750,00:01:43.500,And I was taken aback by this certain timeless atmosphere.
00:01:46.208,00:01:49.750,Bicycles passing by silently on the boardwalk at sunset.
00:01:52.166,00:01:54.458,A wonderful place for summer vacation.
00:01:56.166,00:02:00.958,"But even in Forte dei Marmi, the days get shorter and the nights get longer."
00:02:07.250,00:02:14.208,"On the peaks of the Apuan Alps, the crumbled white marble makes way for a mantle of icy snow."
00:02:15.541,00:02:17.166,The dark devours the light.
00:02:17.666,00:02:19.500,And fear grips us.
00:02:22.333,00:02:26.375,Even in Forte dei Marmi we've learned to keep ourselves safe.
00:02:29.041,00:02:34.166,That sunny and serene town… now seems empty.
00:02:35.416,00:02:36.791,As if evacuated.
00:02:41.250,00:02:42.791,is a winter story.
00:02:58.958,00:03:51.291,CAMERA PAC-15 Help… Help!
00:04:06.666,00:04:08.750,Help. Help!
00:04:39.375,00:04:40.750,From Barbados.
00:04:44.750,00:04:48.791,They're worried because of something they saw on their gate camera.
00:04:52.916,00:04:56.000,You told me I could call you for the Premium clients.
00:04:57.458,00:04:58.666,You did the right thing.
00:04:59.250,00:05:01.250,"-Good night, Emma. -Get some sleep."
00:05:01.333,00:05:02.166,I'll try.
00:05:44.625,00:05:46.541,So? Everything okay?
00:05:46.625,00:05:49.041,The perimeter cameras are fine.
00:05:49.541,00:05:52.125,"-Yes, but… -No signs of break-in."
00:05:52.208,00:05:55.458,"No, I was telling you, the girl looked like she was in distress."
00:05:55.958,00:05:57.125,Who knows what she saw.
00:05:57.208,00:05:58.791,Maybe there's a prowler around.
00:05:59.625,00:06:03.750,"They've invaded the country. No place is safe anymore, you know?"
00:06:03.833,00:06:06.375,I understand. We can't say if it's an immigrant.
00:06:06.458,00:06:08.375,"But, please, check anyway."
00:06:08.458,00:06:09.541,"Very well, I will."
00:06:10.583,00:06:11.708,"Thank you, Santini."
00:06:12.500,00:06:14.416,"Okay, have a nice day."
00:06:16.541,00:06:19.041,"Actually, it's the middle of the night here."
00:06:20.583,00:06:21.958,But thanks anyway.
00:06:22.041,00:06:24.083,"-Goodbye, Santini. -Bye."
00:06:48.583,00:06:58.500,FAVORITES I have a possible DUI between Volta and Carrara streets.

00:07:05.375,00:07:07.250,Thank you. Thank you.
00:07:19.458,00:07:21.125,"Listen, there's no need anymore."
00:07:22.000,00:07:23.083,Are you sure?
00:07:23.166,00:07:25.083,"Yes, I'll take care of it. Bye."
00:07:27.541,00:07:29.541,"-What's your problem, asshole? -Dario."
00:07:30.291,00:07:31.333,Do I know you?
00:07:32.125,00:07:33.291,I know your mom.
00:07:35.083,00:07:38.125,Hop in. You can't drive like this. I'll take you home.
00:07:57.583,00:07:58.583,What did he do?
00:07:59.500,00:08:01.375,We'll settle this later. Come in.
00:08:01.458,00:08:02.458,Settle what?
00:08:05.125,00:08:06.458,He was driving drunk.
00:08:07.250,00:08:08.875,"Luckily, I saw him."
00:08:10.541,00:08:12.416,I'm afraid it's more than alcohol.
00:08:16.041,00:08:17.958,What were you doing out at this hour?
00:08:19.333,00:08:21.250,Some billionaire must've lost his cat.
00:08:32.583,00:08:33.708,The car is on Volta.
00:08:38.708,00:08:39.833,"Thank you, Roberto."
00:08:40.625,00:08:42.125,-Good night. -Yes.
00:08:42.208,00:08:43.333,Nice seeing you.
00:09:07.625,00:09:08.458,Dario!
00:09:17.125,00:10:07.666,Dario… Who are you kidding?
00:10:07.750,00:10:10.000,Even Angela knows you weren't here last night.
00:10:10.083,00:10:11.250,She came back at three.
00:10:11.333,00:10:12.333,On a Monday.
00:10:13.125,00:10:15.250,There are no more rules in this house.
00:10:18.875,00:10:26.083,"Your clients, the anthropologists… do they know that when you can't sleep here, you go try at their place?"
00:10:26.166,00:10:28.500,"They're in South Africa, for a while."
00:10:28.583,00:10:30.250,-Ah. -Where was Angela?
00:10:30.333,00:10:34.833,"FOR MAYOR If you're so interested, why don't you ask her, or track her phone?"
00:10:34.916,00:10:37.583,We've talked about it. I don't want to install that shit on her phone.
00:10:37.666,00:10:38.500,Mm.
00:10:38.583,00:10:40.125,-Let's let her live her life. -Sure.

00:10:59.333,00:11:02.416,How many times have I told you not to be late on weeknights because of school?
00:11:02.500,00:11:03.625,I already told Mom.
00:11:03.708,00:11:06.416,I was at Ginevra's doing homework and we fell asleep.
00:11:06.916,00:11:07.875,Where were you?
00:11:09.291,00:11:10.416,"It's late, gotta go."
00:11:14.541,00:11:16.708,Did you see Mom on the front page?
00:11:17.333,00:11:19.541,Angela! Did you see Mom on the front page?
00:11:20.291,00:11:21.958,"She didn't hear, she was rushing."
00:11:25.500,00:11:28.041,Here comes someone who cares.
00:11:33.333,00:11:36.500,"Not really the best image of us, right? Come on, go."
00:11:37.166,00:11:40.208,"Please, take those sleeping pills. You look like a vampire."
00:11:40.291,00:11:42.041,Those drugs make me crazy.
00:11:42.125,00:11:43.958,"Like you're sane now, huh?"

00:13:41.750,00:13:46.083,This is what Clementi's camera recorded last night.
00:13:50.875,00:13:53.166,Which clients live on that street?
00:13:53.666,00:13:55.583,Why? Is the footage backed up?
00:13:56.833,00:14:00.416,"Yes, all the perimeter cameras back up the footage."
00:14:15.625,00:14:18.000,Why do you have a coat on? Are you cold?
00:14:18.083,00:14:20.291,I hate winter. I hate it.

00:14:45.041,00:14:46.041,Fuck!
00:14:47.916,00:14:48.750,What is it?
00:14:49.875,00:14:50.791,It's Walter.
00:14:51.750,00:14:53.125,That's his daughter Maria.
00:14:57.708,00:14:58.833,He was my electrician.
00:14:59.625,00:15:01.000,The best on the market.
00:15:04.125,00:15:06.625,Who's that guy recording?
00:15:12.208,00:15:47.291,"Walter, Walter… LIBRARY CREATIVE WRITING COURSES So, before delighting you with my words of wisdom, I have to give you some bad news."
00:15:48.250,00:15:50.458,"Maria Spezi, your classmate, is in the hospital."
00:15:50.541,00:15:52.041,"Oh, my God, what happened?"
00:15:52.125,00:15:54.250,Must've tripped on one of her dad's bottles.
00:15:54.333,00:15:56.416,"Guys, please, please."
00:15:57.291,00:16:01.333,"Anyway, Maria is fine. It's not serious. Now, please, let's get to work."
00:16:02.625,00:16:06.416,"So… uh, Angela. We left off at the apple of discord, right?"
00:16:06.500,00:16:09.333,-Are you ready? -No. Not yet.
00:16:09.416,00:16:14.041,I have to get my mom and dad in the same room for more than ten seconds.
00:16:19.000,00:16:22.875,Sweetie… I don't know how else to tell you.
00:16:23.375,00:16:25.083,I am not your professor.
00:16:25.875,00:16:29.541,"History, Math, Geography… you study that stuff out there, with the others."

00:16:35.041,00:16:38.416,"And not the truth they show you on TV, or on social media."
00:16:39.416,00:16:47.875,"Guys, I'm here… to try to teach you how to make life interesting on paper."
00:16:49.500,00:16:53.708,"Assuming you survive the agents, publicists, editors and whatnot."
00:17:00.625,00:17:04.833,We deliver these phones to their temporary resting place.
00:17:06.333,00:17:13.125,"Nothing leaves this sacred place, so, please, no judgment, honesty until the end."
00:17:13.208,00:17:14.875,Ginevra. Go.
00:17:15.625,00:17:16.791,I'm all ears.

00:17:26.541,00:17:33.166,"The first time I met my dad's business partner, Volmaro, I was six years old."
00:17:34.333,00:17:36.625,"Ten years later, I was his Lolita."
00:17:38.416,00:17:40.916,And he was my revenge against my parents.
00:17:43.166,00:17:44.375,I was insatiable.
00:17:44.458,00:17:45.500,Mom!
00:17:45.583,00:17:46.916,Insatiable.
00:17:47.541,00:17:52.208,"But it wasn't about fucking, it was about fucking with people's heads."
00:18:03.041,00:18:05.500,"Sorry, Angela, any more noises you want to make?"
00:18:07.875,00:18:11.875,that the narrator's point of view is lacking a bit of… empathy?
00:18:11.958,00:18:14.083,"Professor, this is my trauma."
00:18:14.708,00:18:17.083,I won't stand here and be offended like this.
00:18:17.166,00:18:18.166,You're right.
00:18:19.958,00:18:21.208,You shouldn't have to.
00:18:21.291,00:18:22.666,"Go on, please."
00:18:37.500,00:18:38.791,-Enzino. -Hey.
00:18:39.333,00:18:41.000,-The vigilante. -How's everything?
00:18:41.083,00:18:47.916,-Good. You? -Good. Listen… Who's the guy that was recording? Domenichetti?
00:18:48.708,00:18:50.625,Why? The case is closed.
00:18:51.166,00:18:53.541,"-He's guilty, he confessed. -Mm."
00:18:53.625,00:18:55.125,Look at the file.
00:19:04.208,00:19:06.916,He complained about Spezi for being drunk and disorderly.
00:19:08.208,00:19:09.625,He was scared for the daughter.
00:19:09.708,00:19:13.125,He says they had a huge fight a few hours earlier.
00:19:18.208,00:19:20.375,Getting things back to normal is an uphill battle.
00:19:21.250,00:19:22.083,Uphill?
00:19:23.958,00:19:25.333,Not everyone can do it.
00:19:38.416,00:19:39.250,Maria.
00:19:40.666,00:19:43.125,"On a scale from one to ten, how much does it hurt?"
00:19:43.916,00:19:44.791,Eleven.
00:19:46.000,00:19:51.083,We'll go easy at first. So… Can you move your fingers like this?
00:19:56.291,00:19:57.750,Good. The other way.
00:20:00.333,00:20:01.875,Let me check the mobility.
00:20:03.125,00:20:06.666,"So, easy. Let your arm go, leave it to me."
00:20:06.750,00:20:07.583,Ouch!
00:20:09.458,00:20:11.666,Let's try again. Let go.
00:20:11.750,00:20:13.041,"Ouch, ouch, ouch!"
00:20:16.041,00:20:17.000,"So, Maria."
00:20:18.125,00:20:20.041,You have a dislocated shoulder.
00:20:20.125,00:20:23.666,"And if you go on like this, you might even lose mobility on your arm."
00:20:24.500,00:20:26.666,"The more you do now, the less you'll have to do later."
00:20:34.833,00:21:20.458,BAKERY SWEETS PASTRIES CAKES Hey… Come on. Take a bite of the forbidden fruit.
00:21:23.750,00:21:25.833,-Already have. -Do it again.
00:21:26.375,00:21:29.541,"Honey, for that, you need someone your own age."
00:21:31.458,00:21:33.875,You're too insatiable.
00:21:33.958,00:21:35.958,Insatiable? What?
00:21:36.041,00:21:38.250,Don't you dare compare me to Ginevra!
00:21:38.916,00:21:40.875,What we have between us is real.
00:21:41.708,00:21:42.916,"I know, but I have work."
00:21:54.708,00:21:56.666,Sunday night you came back super late.
00:21:56.750,00:21:59.833,You didn't let me sleep here. Where the hell were you?
00:22:00.416,00:22:03.458,"You're talking like my ex-wife, and she's an ex for a reason."
00:22:06.125,00:22:07.708,I don't want to cage you.
00:22:08.208,00:22:11.416,But I feel that there's something wrong. I only want to help you.
00:22:11.500,00:22:16.833,Listen… The pressure to finish this damn book is driving me crazy.
00:22:16.916,00:22:19.958,"I don't even know if I'll finish. Actually, if you're here, I won't."
00:22:20.041,00:22:24.500,"So, please, give me a week and I'm all yours, but now leave."
00:22:25.541,00:22:26.375,I beg you.
00:22:31.375,00:22:34.583,You still haven't answered my question. Where were you Sunday night?
00:22:36.083,00:22:38.166,"-Out, driving around. -What for?"
00:22:39.375,00:22:41.541,-Looking for something. -What?
00:22:41.625,00:22:43.583,I don't know. Something. My muse.
00:23:06.541,00:23:08.208,"Do I look good, at least?"
00:23:10.416,00:23:13.500,Very sexy. In the school's courtyard.
00:23:13.583,00:23:14.708,Good.
00:23:14.791,00:23:16.708,They would all die if they knew.
00:23:17.333,00:23:19.291,"But they must never know, Angela."
00:23:20.375,00:23:21.208,Never.
00:23:37.916,00:23:39.166,You're hurting me!
00:23:45.666,00:23:46.833,It's my fault!
00:23:49.541,00:23:50.750,It's my fault!
00:24:01.166,00:24:03.000,"So tragic, this thing with Spezi."
00:24:03.083,00:24:05.875,It couldn't have happened at a better time for you.
00:24:09.333,00:24:11.375,That's a low blow.
00:24:13.333,00:24:14.750,You look pretty tonight.
00:24:16.291,00:24:17.583,-Yeah? -Yeah.
00:24:18.458,00:24:21.875,I wonder if it's for the event or for Pilati.
00:24:27.000,00:24:30.208,"You know, if I wasn't married, I'd be very attracted to him."
00:24:30.291,00:24:33.791,"Not true. You're married, but you're still attracted to him."
00:24:35.083,00:24:36.375,-Mm. -I get it.
00:24:37.333,00:24:40.750,He's the opposite of me. Everything I'll never be.
00:24:41.250,00:24:43.083,"A rich, elegant man."
00:24:44.333,00:24:45.166,Rich.
00:24:48.625,00:24:49.791,Here we are.
00:24:53.083,00:24:55.458,"So, try not to have too much fun."
00:24:55.541,00:24:58.666,"And, please, remember, do not shake Pilati's hand."
00:24:58.750,00:25:01.125,What's with the whole no touching thing?
00:25:01.833,00:25:09.291,"I get that when you're rich you can afford to have any phobia, but… A relationship without touching isn't a real relationship."
00:25:09.375,00:25:10.500,Not necessarily.
00:25:20.541,00:25:22.208,-Good evening. -Good evening.
00:25:22.291,00:25:23.750,"Looking sharp, Carlo."
00:25:30.416,00:25:31.583,-Curzio… -Claudia.
00:25:32.083,00:25:33.583,See what a turnout?
00:25:33.666,00:25:35.500,Everyone that matters is here.
00:25:35.583,00:25:37.166,-Incredible. -Thanks to you.
00:25:39.416,00:25:50.125,"Roberto, look at your wife tonight. In this light, she's like… Delicate on the outside, solid like marble on the inside."
00:25:50.208,00:25:52.125,"You're a lucky man, Roberto."
00:25:52.625,00:25:54.250,I've always thought so too.
00:25:55.041,00:25:57.166,-Speeches in five minutes. -Sure.
00:25:57.250,00:25:59.041,The billionaire Ferrario is here.
00:26:02.458,00:26:04.250,"-One whiskey, please. -Roberto."
00:26:04.333,00:26:07.708,"May I introduce you to my new American client, Camilla?"
00:26:08.500,00:26:10.458,She just bought a place on Via Gorizia.
00:26:10.541,00:26:13.166,"Just in time, if the rumors are true."
00:26:14.291,00:26:15.208,What rumors?
00:26:15.291,00:26:21.375,"If Marcello Ferrario is going to invest, we expect the value of the homes to go up at least 20 percent."
00:26:21.458,00:26:25.583,Do you know that Ferrario shouldn't even be here tonight?
00:26:25.666,00:26:29.166,"In fact, no photos allowed. Not even with the phone."
00:26:29.250,00:26:38.208,God forbid that a progressive like him would be seen Are we boring you?
00:26:44.750,00:26:45.583,Yes.
00:26:50.375,00:26:53.500,I'm an insomniac. I haven't slept in a few nights.
00:26:54.083,00:26:55.083,Poor guy.
00:26:55.958,00:26:57.416,Are you taking anything?
00:26:57.958,00:27:02.000,Otherwise you're at risk of having hallucinations.
00:27:05.125,00:27:29.708,"Well, first thing, I know you all, and I know that for many of you, Forte dei Marmi is a second home."
00:27:29.791,00:27:31.583,"Even a third, a fourth."
00:27:34.041,00:27:39.583,"Bur Forte is mainly a place… that is dear to us all, eh?"
00:27:40.333,00:27:43.750,"And nobody can tell us we don't deserve it, otherwise we'll get mad."
00:27:45.458,00:27:56.000,"Ladies and gentlemen… Our next mayor, or better yet, out first female mayor and also our best mayor to date, I guarantee it."
00:27:57.708,00:28:01.583,"Claudia Raffaelli, for a safer Forte dei Marmi."
00:28:02.916,00:28:04.833,"Thank you, thank you."
00:28:07.166,00:28:08.958,I was born in Forte dei Marmi.
00:28:10.125,00:28:11.375,I grew up here.
00:28:12.041,00:28:14.333,My daughter was born and raised here.
00:28:14.416,00:28:16.208,It's here that I want to grow old.
00:28:17.125,00:28:20.208,"When I was little, I would wander around freely."
00:28:20.708,00:28:22.083,The streets were safe.
00:28:23.000,00:28:25.166,We had nothing to be scared of.
00:28:25.250,00:28:27.125,We left our doors unlocked.
00:28:27.208,00:28:28.541,Think about that.
00:28:29.333,00:28:31.791,There's a reason why they're called invaders.
00:28:32.625,00:28:35.166,Or… undesirables.
00:28:40.125,00:28:50.416,…the debt we owe to our Colonel Mori… …if the recent wave of thefts and robberies is finally under control.
00:28:51.583,00:29:02.833,"You know, a dramatic event, like the one that struck us early Sunday morning, involving that young girl, is the perfect example."
00:29:04.250,00:29:07.708,She was attacked by someone she trusted.
00:29:15.250,00:29:16.458,Are you coming in?
00:29:17.541,00:29:20.541,Do you want a vampire running around the house at 3:00 a.m.?
00:29:23.875,00:29:25.875,Everyone was in love with you tonight.
00:30:10.250,00:30:11.125,Claudia?
00:30:11.625,00:30:12.833,"It's late, what is it?"
00:30:12.916,00:30:15.041,"Roberto, that bitch changed her tune."
00:30:15.125,00:30:17.250,She says it all happened at Pilati's house.
00:30:19.541,00:30:21.375,-What? -But it's not true.
00:30:21.458,00:30:24.958,"Don't worry, he wasn't there. He was in Milan. The house was empty."
00:30:25.041,00:30:28.333,"That's not the issue, the issue is the bad publicity."
00:30:29.041,00:30:30.500,"You have to fix this, please."
00:30:30.583,00:30:33.041,As soon as possible. Okay?
00:30:33.916,00:30:34.750,All right.
00:30:45.541,00:30:47.458,Let me loosen it up a little.
00:30:47.958,00:30:48.791,Wait.
00:30:48.875,00:30:51.000,Let me see the hand… Other side.
00:30:55.916,00:30:57.875,"Obviously, the girl is protecting her dad."
00:30:57.958,00:31:01.625,"After the sedatives wore off, she saw he was in custody, she panicked."
00:31:02.250,00:31:07.041,"Now she says it happened at Pilati's, that she drank a lot, that another boy was there."
00:31:07.125,00:31:08.875,-What boy? -She doesn't know.
00:31:08.958,00:31:11.333,She conveniently forgot the name. It's bullshit.
00:31:11.416,00:31:13.125,She's making it all up.
00:31:18.416,00:31:24.583,"He was drunk, confused, he even resisted, but he confessed on the scene of the crime, let's not forget."
00:31:24.666,00:31:26.375,Are drugs involved?
00:31:26.458,00:31:27.833,The tox screen was clean.
00:31:27.916,00:31:30.708,Except for what they gave her in the hospital for pain.
00:31:33.125,00:31:35.083,-Where is Walter now? -Released.
00:31:37.416,00:31:44.041,If his daughter doesn't want to press charges… Don't worry. We're sending her home with a social worker.
00:31:59.583,00:32:01.708,I just lost a bet with myself.
00:32:01.791,00:32:02.916,What bet?
00:32:03.000,00:32:05.458,I thought I wouldn't see you for another year.
00:32:06.250,00:32:08.958,"Listen, did you pick up Dario's car?"
00:32:09.458,00:32:10.291,Yes.
00:32:11.000,00:32:14.916,Yes… I need to talk to him. Do you know where he is?
00:32:15.666,00:32:18.750,"-If he did something, would you tell me? -Of course."
00:32:19.625,00:32:21.291,He works at the restaurant Gilda.
00:32:22.416,00:32:25.750,All right… maybe I'll see you again later.
00:32:25.833,00:32:26.791,-Bye. -Okay.
00:32:32.583,00:32:35.541,"Dario hasn't been here in five, six weeks."
00:32:35.625,00:32:36.750,Did he say why?
00:32:38.333,00:32:40.458,We do just fine without him.
00:32:40.541,00:32:41.541,Thanks.
00:32:48.250,00:32:52.125,"If you find that dickhead, tell him to call Letizia."
00:32:56.666,00:32:58.500,So I can let it ring.
00:34:08.625,00:34:10.291,"Maria, where do you sleep?"
00:34:13.958,00:34:15.875,"And where do you sleep, sir?"
00:34:17.833,00:34:18.708,In there.
00:34:22.375,00:34:25.166,And do you have a job to support your daughter?
00:34:28.916,00:34:29.750,Yes.
00:34:33.791,00:34:35.500,"Fine, then. Are you sure?"
00:34:36.583,00:34:39.333,"Yes, why does everybody keep asking me that?"
00:34:39.833,00:34:40.791,I'm fine here.
00:34:43.250,00:34:44.500,All right.
00:34:45.458,00:34:47.708,"I'll go, then. Here."
00:34:47.791,00:34:49.208,These are for the pain.
00:34:49.291,00:34:53.625,It's important that Maria takes them exactly as prescribed by the hospital.
00:34:56.625,00:34:57.458,"Bye, Maria."
00:35:03.500,00:35:06.375,"Maria, I'm sorry. If you want, we can talk about what happened."
00:35:06.458,00:35:07.750,I don't feel like it now.
00:35:09.041,00:35:12.083,"Don't worry, I told them that you had nothing to do with it."
00:35:15.125,00:35:17.958,"Look, Maria. Listen… Maria."
00:35:19.291,00:35:21.250,"I'll clear my name, you'll see."
00:35:21.750,00:35:23.958,They can't keep treating us like this.
00:35:24.041,00:35:26.000,They can't keep treating us like this!
00:36:19.291,00:36:21.083,You fell asleep.
00:36:22.750,00:36:24.708,But I can help you.
00:36:24.791,00:36:25.916,"Santini, all good?"
00:36:26.000,00:36:27.416,He fell asleep.
00:36:30.166,00:36:32.625,"Santini, it's green. Go where you need to go."
00:36:32.708,00:36:39.208,"Roberto. Insomnia… The night, the darkness, it's a new perspective."
00:36:39.291,00:36:42.166,"-You have to embrace it. -Fuck off, witch."
00:36:43.000,00:36:43.916,Oh!
00:37:16.041,00:37:19.666,You can't imagine how long I've been waiting for this moment.
00:37:19.750,00:37:20.875,It's so beautiful.
00:37:21.708,00:37:22.541,Wonderful.
00:37:23.041,00:37:24.208,-Shall we? -Yes.
00:37:30.250,00:37:32.791,Zero light pollution and motion sensors.
00:37:33.416,00:37:37.125,They have a very accurate facial recognition system.
00:37:37.208,00:37:42.000,"They can recognize anyone: friends, enemies… undesirables."
00:37:43.041,00:37:45.750,"And for any question you may have, the answer is yes."
00:37:45.833,00:37:48.291,These days you can do anything with technology.
00:37:50.333,00:37:55.750,"No one was raped, nobody died, no broken bones, the hymens are all intact."
00:37:57.500,00:38:00.083,It was nothing more than a family quarrel.
00:38:01.458,00:38:03.458,"You're in the right field, Mr. Santini."
00:38:03.541,00:38:05.250,"Well, yes, my dear Marcello."
00:38:05.916,00:38:07.875,People like us are targets.
00:38:07.958,00:38:09.833,"Undeniably, the world has changed."
00:38:09.916,00:38:15.875,"And we, as targets, can't afford anymore to take pity on those who are behind."
00:38:17.291,00:38:18.625,I don't want a fortress.
00:38:19.250,00:38:22.000,-The house is beautiful for the location. -It's central.
00:38:22.625,00:38:24.958,She just wants Prada and Gucci at walking distance.
00:39:07.791,00:39:09.166,It's not ready yet.
00:39:22.958,00:39:26.458,"This time, I want us to come at the same exact moment."
00:39:27.041,00:39:29.041,I don't want to come until you come too.
00:39:32.250,00:39:37.541,"What the fuck, Angela… It feels like you don't want me like you used to."
00:39:37.625,00:39:43.375,I thought that maybe with this… What the fuck are you talking about?
00:39:44.333,00:39:46.166,"I'm 40, not 70."
00:39:49.541,00:39:51.958,And you really think this is the problem?
00:39:52.625,00:39:54.875,That it only takes a blue pill?
00:39:56.291,00:39:58.666,"Jesus Christ, Angela. You're so immature."
00:40:11.666,00:40:14.333,That you need those scumbags to become mayor.
00:40:15.791,00:40:17.791,-It's part of the game. -Game?
00:40:18.458,00:40:19.458,Yes.
00:40:19.541,00:40:22.541,The hymens are all intact. Nice.
00:40:22.625,00:40:25.333,-I just wonder how the fuck it's possible. -What?
00:40:25.416,00:40:27.333,To not care about what happened to Maria.
00:40:27.416,00:40:29.416,"It was a joke, Roberto."
00:40:30.541,00:40:32.833,"-A joke? -Yes, a joke."
00:40:32.916,00:40:35.750,That girl is scarred for life and we're making jokes?
00:40:35.833,00:40:39.250,I can't stop thinking that it could've happened to Angela.
00:40:39.333,00:40:40.583,But it didn't.
00:40:41.416,00:40:43.375,And I'm making sure that it never will.
00:40:43.458,00:40:45.208,To her or anyone else.
00:40:45.291,00:40:46.833,"-Yeah, yeah… -Yeah, yeah?"
00:40:47.416,00:40:48.375,Unbelievable.
00:40:51.375,00:40:52.625,Let's talk about you.
00:40:53.250,00:40:55.666,Tell me something. Are you seeing Elena again?
00:40:57.458,00:40:58.541,No.
00:40:58.625,00:40:59.875,No?
00:41:03.125,00:41:09.833,No. What about these… -Whose blue pills are these? -They're not mine.
00:41:09.916,00:41:11.375,-They're not yours? -Not mine.
00:41:11.458,00:41:14.208,"Yeah, no, they're mine. Musculus 5."
00:41:15.041,00:41:18.500,"Claudia, I'm 40 years old, not 70. I don't need them."
00:41:20.708,00:41:23.583,-Where did you find them? -At home. Where else?
00:41:23.666,00:41:26.250,"There must be a receipt, an invoice, a stub. Check!"
00:41:26.875,00:41:29.250,-Let me check my purse. -Maybe an online order.
00:41:30.333,00:41:32.583,Here. I found it.
00:41:32.666,00:41:38.083,"I bet you were hoping I wouldn't, but… They're Angela's."
00:41:40.791,00:41:42.333,What does she need them for?
00:41:43.666,00:41:47.083,And isn't it illegal? She's a minor. Who gave them to her?
00:41:49.375,00:41:51.791,"Oh, God. Who is she sleeping with?"
00:41:53.666,00:41:55.291,Is she sleeping with an old man?
00:41:56.541,00:41:58.250,"God, this family is falling apart."
00:41:59.333,00:42:01.166,We don't talk to each other anymore.
00:42:02.250,00:42:06.916,We're like roommates who share the same house… and that's it.
00:42:27.416,00:42:28.958,Wasn't he in jail?
00:42:40.375,00:42:41.416,He's crazy.
00:42:42.000,00:42:43.541,Is he coming over here?
00:42:46.375,00:42:47.291,"Oh, my God."
00:42:55.375,00:42:57.416,"You were hiding there, huh?"
00:42:57.500,00:42:58.625,And you?
00:42:58.708,00:43:04.166,Remember when you used to come to Maria's birthday parties and my wife made the angel food cake?
00:43:06.375,00:43:09.791,"Guys, what happened to everybody?"
00:43:10.875,00:43:12.541,I don't know. Who knows!
00:43:13.166,00:43:23.750,Anyway… This is from September. That's after the April arrest.
00:43:23.833,00:43:29.458,"In September, they shot me with a taser gun while I was relaxing at the park."
00:43:29.541,00:43:33.125,"But these days, the police have to arrest everybody."
00:43:33.916,00:43:36.250,"Yes, for a safer future. Eh."
00:43:37.333,00:43:40.666,"But then again, I'm just a statistic. Everybody knows that."
00:43:55.291,00:44:18.083,255 LIKES - THE TOP OF LUXURY IS ONLY IN FORTE DEI MARMI -Did you see this? -What?
00:44:19.083,00:44:22.666,A message from Angela: Family meeting tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.
00:44:24.041,00:44:25.958,No excuses. What is she up to?
00:44:27.250,00:44:28.666,We'll find out tomorrow.
00:44:31.208,00:44:47.708,"No excuses… The good news is that out of Villa Casamora's five owners, Only one of the brothers is still a bit reluctant."
00:44:47.791,00:44:48.625,Why?
00:44:49.208,00:44:50.958,He wants more than a fifth.
00:44:53.291,00:44:56.750,"-Honestly, I think he is. -Keep going. Don't mind me."
00:44:58.541,00:45:02.208,"Now, let's move on to the subject of the contract."
00:45:36.708,00:45:38.750,"We have some unfinished business, you and I."
00:45:39.375,00:45:42.250,"Yeah… Well, yeah."
00:45:43.125,00:45:46.083,"If you can find a place, I can find some time."
00:45:47.250,00:45:49.416,-When? -Tonight?
00:45:53.291,00:45:55.500,I'm almost sure I can find a babysitter.
00:45:57.083,00:46:00.583,"Look, don't expect me to babysit Federico, okay?"
00:46:00.666,00:46:01.500,Of course not.
00:46:01.583,00:46:04.500,It'd be inhumane to ask you for something like that.
00:46:05.250,00:46:06.250,He's going to Ugo's.
00:46:14.000,00:46:16.541,"Okay, sure. I'll text you later."
00:46:16.625,00:46:17.500,-Okay. -Bye.
00:46:20.458,00:46:21.291,Who was that?
00:46:23.625,00:46:24.583,It was Emma.
00:46:25.250,00:46:27.166,She wanted to switch to the day shift.
00:46:29.083,00:46:30.875,-I brought you coffee. -Thanks.
00:47:13.958,00:47:15.375,Terms of sale.
00:47:15.458,00:47:29.750,"The sale is made according to the following terms and conditions… I'll explain later… The properties in question, are and will be, until the date of the final contract of sale… I have to tell you."
00:47:29.833,00:47:37.291,"…deed, with no foreclosure… You can't touch him."
00:47:38.791,00:47:41.541,"He can't be touched, is that clear?"
00:47:45.750,00:47:49.458,"For me, touching… is like handling dead meat."
00:47:50.125,00:47:52.083,"Curzio, I'm sorry. I'm mortified."
00:47:53.250,00:47:54.250,Unbelievable.
00:47:57.291,00:48:23.958,-I'm done. I'm going. -Yes… And that's Maria.
00:48:43.750,00:48:44.791,"Yes, toast away."
00:48:56.375,00:48:57.791,"There you go, Pilati."
00:50:05.916,00:50:26.208,"DELETED REFORMATTED DELETED REFORMATTED Emma, how come some of Pilati's internal cameras have been reformatted?"
00:50:27.333,00:50:29.500,Must've been Ferrario's staff.
00:50:29.583,00:50:31.916,Ferrario's staff? Who authorized them?
00:50:33.541,00:50:34.666,Your wife.
00:50:37.625,00:50:40.833,Why are the perimeter cams' backups gone from the iCloud?
00:50:40.916,00:50:42.375,She gave them full access.
00:50:42.458,00:50:45.416,They had to delete all evidence of Ferrario's presence.
00:50:46.958,00:50:49.000,For that fucking fundraiser!
00:50:49.083,00:50:51.541,The study's footage disappeared too. Why?
00:50:51.625,00:50:54.333,Because Ferrario went in there. Because we all did.
00:50:54.833,00:50:56.041,That's why it's gone.
00:50:57.250,00:51:00.875,"Sorry, Roberto. Claudia told me not to bother you with that stuff."
00:51:00.958,00:51:02.666,No worries. My apologies.
00:51:04.625,00:51:06.166,Claudia did the right thing.
00:51:06.916,00:51:08.458,She sure did the right thing.
00:51:13.250,00:51:14.750,-That's not true. -It is.
00:51:25.666,00:51:28.166,Hi. How's it going?
00:51:28.250,00:51:30.750,-Thank you. I owe you one. -No problem.
00:52:32.833,00:52:34.833,-It's my conscience. -Not tonight.
00:53:05.541,00:53:07.458,"Any hidden cameras, Santini?"
00:53:08.041,00:53:09.833,Anyone else spying on us?
00:53:20.166,00:53:22.458,Can thermal cameras detect excitement?
00:53:23.750,00:53:25.333,-Definitely. Yes. -Yes?
00:53:59.958,00:54:03.000,"Don't worry. I'm coming, I'm practically in the car."
00:54:03.083,00:54:03.958,All right?
00:54:15.333,00:54:17.458,Elena… Elena!
00:54:19.625,00:54:22.833,"-Where are you going? What happened? -Federico called, he's desperate."
00:54:23.333,00:54:25.791,"He didn't want to go to Ugo's, and I forced him."
00:54:25.875,00:54:27.250,What kind of a mother am I?
00:54:28.333,00:54:31.208,"See why I can't do this? I make mistakes, I lose my head."
00:54:32.291,00:54:35.833,"I'm sorry, this is all wrong. I don't have time to make these mistakes."
00:54:35.916,00:54:38.750,A mistake? Is this what we are now? A mistake?
00:54:40.500,00:54:42.458,You said we had unfinished business.
00:54:43.916,00:54:45.166,And you were right.
00:54:47.500,00:54:55.791,"You know, when… When we broke up, I made a promise to myself that if I couldn't have you, then I wouldn't have anyone else."
00:54:56.666,00:54:58.541,And that's exactly what I got.
00:54:59.208,00:55:00.041,Nothing.
00:55:00.625,00:55:04.583,I didn't let anyone else make me feel like I did when I was with you: Alive.
00:55:05.750,00:55:09.583,"Now I've become a fucking man without a face, without features."
00:55:10.666,00:55:11.833,Look at me!
00:55:11.916,00:55:14.625,One son hates me and the other can't go a second without me.
00:55:14.708,00:55:17.250,-Let me talk to Dario. -I told you. I got it.
00:55:19.083,00:55:22.083,He was at Pilati's house the night something happened to Maria.
00:55:26.708,00:55:28.208,Why are you telling me now?
00:55:28.708,00:55:30.666,You're telling me after we slept together?
00:55:30.750,00:55:31.666,Jesus!
00:55:32.291,00:55:34.041,We said it wouldn't happen again.
00:55:34.125,00:55:37.333,"I'm telling you now, only because now I think it could've been him."
00:55:37.416,00:55:39.625,I have to talk to him before anyone else does.
00:55:39.708,00:55:42.166,There's no good reason for me to drop this.
00:56:14.291,00:56:18.083,"Sunday night, when I found you… were you drunk?"
00:56:18.958,00:56:19.958,Where had you been?
00:56:21.541,00:56:22.791,Sunday?
00:56:24.541,00:56:26.750,I was drinking with a friend at a bar in Sarzana.
00:56:27.250,00:56:29.625,-Why do you care? -I care because it's not true.
00:56:30.916,00:56:32.916,You were at Curzio Pilati's house.
00:56:36.666,00:56:37.541,It's true.
00:56:38.041,00:56:39.291,"Sunday, yes."
00:56:39.875,00:56:41.583,I work for him now. So?
00:56:42.125,00:56:44.625,"I do a few small jobs, mostly at night."
00:56:44.708,00:56:47.625,I keep an eye on things… Like a custodian.
00:56:47.708,00:56:51.833,"Dario, I love you, but what sane person would hire you to keep an eye on anything?"
00:56:51.916,00:56:54.916,This is why I never say shit to my mom about what I do.
00:56:56.791,00:56:58.208,-Is this an interrogation? -Yes!
00:56:59.541,00:57:02.000,At Bagno Gilda. He always comes for lunch.
00:57:02.541,00:57:06.833,"Listen, Roberto… he pays me three times as much, and it beats cleaning sand."
00:57:08.583,00:57:09.708,And the camera?
00:57:19.416,00:57:20.333,I see.
00:57:21.125,00:57:26.875,"You two are sleeping together now, and this gives you the right to play Dad, but it doesn't work like that."
00:57:28.000,00:57:29.625,"Dario, Dario!"
00:57:29.708,00:57:30.541,Dario!
00:57:30.625,00:57:33.583,I broke the camera because he fired me for no reason.
00:57:33.666,00:57:34.666,He's a strange guy.
00:57:34.750,00:57:36.958,And Maria Spezi? Why was she there?
00:57:39.208,00:57:40.041,Well?
00:57:45.625,00:57:50.875,Okay… Pilati and another guy found her wandering around.
00:57:53.875,00:57:56.666,She tried to get in the church on Via Trento. She was crying.
00:57:56.750,00:57:59.375,-And they made her get in the car. -Whose car?
00:57:59.458,00:58:02.083,-Pilati's car. -And she got in just like that?
00:58:02.166,00:58:03.958,No. Obviously not.
00:58:04.041,00:58:06.875,She knew this guy and this guy knew her.
00:58:08.166,00:58:09.875,"Listen, she was very shaken."
00:58:10.333,00:58:11.375,I don't know why.
00:58:12.750,00:58:15.750,"We drank, we got drunk, especially her."
00:58:15.833,00:58:17.333,Then we made her coffee.
00:58:17.916,00:58:19.500,"-Coffee? -Yes, coffee."
00:58:19.583,00:58:21.625,-The coffee thing is true. -See?
00:58:21.708,00:58:25.833,"I tried to sober this girl up, and then I went straight home."
00:58:26.333,00:58:27.166,I swear.
00:58:28.125,00:58:30.916,I feel sorry too that she got herself hurt.
00:58:31.500,00:58:35.083,"Just, whatever happened, I know nothing about it."
00:58:51.833,00:58:53.375,One thing at a time.
00:58:54.875,00:58:56.166,"Slowly, slowly."
00:59:25.916,00:59:27.083,I forgot something.
00:59:29.291,00:59:32.125,"You're late. I texted you, don't you look at your phone?"
00:59:33.791,00:59:34.708,There was traffic.
00:59:45.208,00:59:49.916,So… My essay is titled Apple of Discord.
00:59:51.708,00:59:55.958,"Um… Mom, I already know you won't like it."
00:59:56.041,00:59:59.166,It's time to tell the truth about what happened in this family.
01:00:00.250,01:00:03.833,"Specifically, what happened in this family when I was seven years old."
01:00:06.833,01:00:14.208,Okay… Why is this thing such an apple of discord for you?
01:00:20.708,01:00:22.833,It was the worst day of my life.
01:00:24.125,01:00:26.083,I lost you for ten minutes at the park.
01:00:26.916,01:00:28.791,It was ten minutes of anguish.
01:00:29.333,01:00:30.583,Ten minutes of agony.
01:00:31.208,01:00:33.583,After which we found you behind a carousel.
01:00:33.666,01:00:37.083,And there was that sicko Walter Spezi molesting you.
01:00:37.166,01:00:43.791,"He had his penis out and sperm all over his pants… Claudia… Luckily, your dad got there and stopped him."
01:00:45.416,01:00:47.958,-There. Happy now? -Why don't I remember?
01:00:48.041,01:00:50.000,"Because you were traumatized, honey."
01:00:50.666,01:00:53.166,Because the mind protects you and forgets.
01:00:53.833,01:00:59.666,I only remember a strange doctor who was showing me some dolls… The psychiatrist who helped you heal.
01:00:59.750,01:01:02.625,-Why wasn't Spezi charged? -Good question.
01:01:04.125,01:01:04.958,Good question.
01:01:09.125,01:01:11.250,But I'll see to it. I'll take care of it.
01:01:12.333,01:01:14.750,"And this time, he'll pay."
01:01:14.833,01:01:16.708,Mom! And there she goes.
01:01:16.791,01:01:19.458,You know that it's impossible to talk to her about it.
01:01:19.541,01:01:20.416,Perfect!
01:01:22.291,01:01:23.541,You can't help me either?
01:01:23.625,01:01:26.083,"What I can tell you is that it was pee, not sperm."
01:01:26.625,01:01:31.041,And speaking of truth in the family… You're going to tell me about some blue pills. Don't move.
01:01:31.125,01:01:32.000,Claudia!
01:01:37.833,01:01:40.458,"I had to fire Spezi for you, but it wasn't enough?"
01:01:40.541,01:01:42.916,No! It wasn't.
01:01:43.000,01:01:49.958,"I don't understand why you investigate everybody, but you systematically refuse to look into our daughter and what she's hiding from us."
01:01:50.041,01:01:52.333,"-Maybe because I don't want to know. -Yes, clearly."
01:01:57.666,01:01:58.500,Angela!
01:02:07.541,01:02:09.041,Many times I promised you.
01:02:18.791,01:02:20.708,Let's try the date of birth.
01:02:23.083,01:02:25.291,Date of birth backwards.
01:02:29.583,01:02:31.791,What could it be? An address?
01:02:42.750,01:02:53.375,"Don't tell me that you're so… Angela, Angela. I haven't taught you anything… Five, eight, three, zero, two, four."
01:02:54.500,01:03:01.208,ANGELA S. CELLPHONE Where have you been?
01:03:08.500,01:03:14.708,Tuesday… What place is this?
01:03:15.666,01:03:17.333,What's this Bakery?
01:03:38.000,01:03:39.666,Where did you go?
01:03:39.750,01:04:06.708,"CAPRIGLIA - RESIDENTIAL Calm down… My love, my love, my love, my love… Who the fuck is this guy, Angela?"
01:04:08.916,01:04:11.541,Who is he? Who the fuck is he?
01:04:11.625,01:04:13.875,MEMORIES Vacation. Friends.
01:04:37.125,01:05:02.500,"No, no, no… I'm trying to find the truth… in a fog of conflicting memories."
01:05:04.916,01:05:06.125,How did you find me?
01:05:08.750,01:05:10.666,I can't believe it. You spied on me!
01:05:10.750,01:05:13.458,-You said you'd never do that! -Who's this asshole?
01:05:14.416,01:05:16.958,-Why did you go to Milan with him? -He's not an asshole.
01:05:18.083,01:05:20.083,-He's my professor. -Your professor?
01:05:20.166,01:05:24.416,We were in Milan for an important meeting with his literary agent.
01:05:24.500,01:05:26.333,He had an important meeting?
01:05:26.416,01:05:28.416,And how did you end up in bed together?
01:05:29.166,01:05:31.791,Okay… You want the truth? Fine.
01:05:32.666,01:05:36.125,I'm not going to college. I'm moving to Milan with Stefano.
01:05:36.625,01:05:39.416,"-You're not going anywhere, Angela. -You don't get it!"
01:05:39.500,01:05:43.708,He's writing a novel that's probably going to be a huge success.
01:05:43.791,01:05:45.500,And you believe this bullshit?
01:05:45.583,01:05:47.958,"What bullshit? Google him, go ahead!"
01:05:48.458,01:05:50.833,Stefano Tommasi. He's an author.
01:05:50.916,01:05:54.083,He wrote a book that actual people bought and read.
01:05:54.166,01:05:55.333,Do what you want.
01:05:56.583,01:05:58.750,But I have to do something too.
01:05:58.833,01:06:04.541,I have to go to the police and tell them that your professor was at Pilati's with Maria Spezi that night.
01:06:06.041,01:06:08.416,"I'm not making it up, I have proof. I'm sorry."
01:06:11.625,01:06:14.500,You don't even know what it means to be in love.
01:06:20.041,01:06:21.958,You don't know anything about love!
01:06:38.416,01:06:46.000,You told us that the only people in the house with you that night were Pilati… and a kid whose name you didn't remember.
01:06:47.875,01:06:48.708,Yes.
01:06:49.750,01:06:51.250,Do you remember now?
01:06:55.125,01:06:55.958,No.
01:06:57.875,01:06:59.625,"There was no one else, then?"
01:07:04.875,01:07:05.708,No.
01:07:06.208,01:07:10.666,"So, you didn't get there with Pilati and your professor, Stefano Tommasi?"
01:07:14.333,01:07:21.291,"No, it's… Professor Tommasi, um… he left before everything went down."
01:07:21.375,01:07:23.000,That's convenient.
01:07:24.666,01:07:28.291,Sorry. Is there anyone that you're not trying to cover for in this story?
01:07:35.333,01:07:37.916,"Sorry, I don't feel very well. I want to go outside."
01:07:42.291,01:07:44.375,Is there something you'd like to say?
01:07:45.916,01:07:48.333,I… I didn't hurt my daughter.
01:07:48.916,01:07:50.000,"Or anyone, it seems."
01:07:57.166,01:07:58.000,Walter.
01:07:59.583,01:08:02.041,Do you think you deserve a daughter like her?
01:08:03.916,01:08:05.083,No. I don't.
01:08:15.541,01:08:18.208,I left before that whole mess happened.
01:08:18.750,01:08:20.333,And I went home. I swear.
01:08:24.500,01:08:26.166,Anyone that can confirm that?
01:08:43.541,01:08:45.750,"Mr. Pilati, we're ready when you are."
01:08:45.833,01:08:51.291,"-Oh, there she is! -Curzio… You lied. You told me you were in Milan when it happened."
01:08:51.375,01:08:56.083,No. I didn't say that. I said that I left them in the kitchen. I wasn't there.
01:08:56.166,01:09:00.000,"Claudia… You understand the risk here, right?"
01:09:00.083,01:09:02.791,Not just for me. For you and the election.
01:09:02.875,01:09:05.375,"-Many people would want to read… -Picture, please."
01:09:05.458,01:09:06.875,"-Yes… -Yes, of course."
01:09:06.958,01:09:10.291,Pilati's associate arrested for sexual harassment.
01:09:10.916,01:09:12.875,My lawyers are very worried.
01:09:12.958,01:09:17.708,"But if it really happened in my house, Claudia, and I pray it didn't, you have to help me."
01:09:18.333,01:09:19.875,"Meanwhile, I did what I had to do."
01:09:19.958,01:09:23.125,"I fired that Dario, my custodian. An animal."
01:09:24.041,01:09:26.208,"-Dario? -Yes, Dario Nobile is his name."
01:09:26.291,01:09:28.375,He even begged me to take him back. Imagine.
01:09:39.708,01:09:48.875,-Our mayor. -Excuse me… Are you avoiding me?
01:09:49.458,01:09:50.291,Huh?
01:09:50.375,01:09:52.875,You don't even pretend to sleep on the couch anymore.
01:09:53.583,01:09:56.125,What do you think you're doing incriminating Pilati?
01:09:56.625,01:09:59.375,Now he has to get his lawyers to come from Milan.
01:09:59.458,01:10:00.916,But I know what you're doing.
01:10:01.000,01:10:03.750,"You're trying to protect that moron, Dario."
01:10:03.833,01:10:06.333,-Your future fucking stepson. -What?
01:10:06.416,01:10:14.541,"I'm only trying to put the pieces together, to get to… You're welcome."
01:10:16.666,01:10:18.083,-Don't make that face. -What face?
01:10:18.166,01:10:20.000,The face you make when you judge me.
01:10:23.000,01:10:26.583,Roberto… This is my big chance.
01:10:27.166,01:10:28.666,My only chance.
01:10:29.166,01:10:32.375,"This is my life, and I won't let you get in my way."
01:10:33.041,01:10:36.250,"Not you, not our marriage. Is that clear?"
01:10:40.166,01:10:41.416,"Yes, I'm ambitious."
01:10:42.250,01:10:43.291,But you know what?
01:10:44.125,01:10:45.791,Some people find that attractive.
01:10:55.333,01:10:56.875,"Claudia, wait."
01:10:59.958,01:11:02.166,What? You have some explaining to do?
01:11:05.958,01:11:07.875,"Matteo, don't you have anything to do?"
01:11:15.166,01:11:16.833,I haven't always been like this.
01:11:18.208,01:11:20.916,This… -reserved? -No.
01:11:21.625,01:11:22.833,The way I am.
01:11:25.791,01:11:32.666,"When that woman touched me in the kitchen, you jumped to defend me, without thinking about it, the way you do."
01:11:33.166,01:11:35.875,"Fierce, but with heart."
01:11:37.166,01:11:39.083,"You made me feel less alone, you know?"
01:11:39.583,01:11:42.333,As if you understood me without expecting anything.
01:11:42.416,01:11:44.958,You can imagine how I felt in that moment.
01:11:49.041,01:11:54.875,"This… This thing that I have, this disease, is devastating, believe me."
01:11:55.666,01:11:57.041,It came out of nowhere.
01:11:57.125,01:12:03.250,"I tried everything, even just to understand, but no one was ever able to connect it to anything. To find a cause."
01:12:04.250,01:12:10.083,It makes it impossible… for any sort of intimate relationship. I freeze.
01:12:12.750,01:12:15.083,"I start getting nervous, and then I break down."
01:12:15.750,01:12:16.916,I can't handle it.
01:12:17.000,01:12:21.166,"Women feel rejected, no matter what I try to say."
01:12:21.250,01:12:22.541,And who can blame them?
01:12:24.125,01:12:28.208,"So, in the end, I chose solitude. It was the easiest thing."
01:12:28.291,01:12:31.583,I've always been a pretty reserved person.
01:12:32.791,01:12:35.875,I'm rich. I can have everything I want.
01:12:36.791,01:12:39.625,Except the thing I desire more than anything.
01:12:40.125,01:12:41.291,Some intimacy.
01:12:42.916,01:12:45.500,"The kind of love that you deserve too, Claudia."
01:12:47.125,01:12:53.416,"Oh, Claudia… I would really love to solve this thing with the best help."
01:12:53.500,01:12:54.708,Your help.
01:12:55.500,01:12:57.750,"Yes, Claudia. I wish I could be with you now."
01:12:58.416,01:12:59.916,In this universe.
01:13:03.625,01:13:05.500,"You're an amazing man, Curzio."
01:13:06.708,01:13:07.708,I will help you.
01:13:23.458,01:13:32.083,"RAPIST Today, Professor Tommasi won't have class. You're all free."
01:13:45.958,01:14:37.750,"HE'S NOT A RAPIST -Why aren't you in school? -What was Pilati doing here, huh?"
01:14:37.833,01:14:38.958,How are you involved?
01:14:39.041,01:14:40.375,"-Angela, listen. -Look at you!"
01:14:40.458,01:14:43.333,"He turned you into a pathetic, boring version of yourself."
01:14:43.416,01:14:45.708,"Angela, sit down! And listen to me."
01:14:49.125,01:14:51.333,I was never writing my novel.
01:14:51.416,01:14:52.250,What?
01:14:52.333,01:14:54.500,I'm the ghostwriter for Pilati's book.
01:14:57.625,01:15:02.583,-Why didn't you tell me? -Because… Because it's not the future I imagined for myself.
01:15:03.083,01:15:04.166,But you know what?
01:15:05.458,01:15:08.333,That man has had a really interesting life.
01:15:08.416,01:15:10.208,He made millions handling debts.
01:15:10.291,01:15:13.375,He has no family and wants this book to be his legacy.
01:15:13.458,01:15:15.583,"Angela, there's potential in here."
01:15:15.666,01:15:17.500,"In his own way, he's a rebel genius."
01:15:17.583,01:15:19.583,A rebel genius? He's an asshole!
01:15:19.666,01:15:21.333,That asshole pays me!
01:15:21.875,01:15:25.333,"Real money, Angela. Money that I need to pay my ex-wife."
01:15:25.416,01:15:27.000,I'll ask you one last time.
01:15:27.083,01:15:33.375,"If you don't tell me the truth, I'll tell the principal that we fucked at least 200 times since June, and I'll expose you."
01:15:34.041,01:15:35.750,What did you do Sunday night?
01:15:37.041,01:15:39.000,"I already told the police, Angela."
01:15:46.750,01:15:50.416,Okay… Okay. You know what we're going to do?
01:15:51.000,01:15:56.375,"We're leaving… We'll go somewhere, we'll go live… in a place that we like."
01:15:56.875,01:15:58.041,I'll take care of us.
01:15:58.125,01:16:00.625,I can study and work. You just worry about writing.
01:16:01.541,01:16:03.458,Remember that you wrote a best-seller!
01:16:03.541,01:16:04.500,Ten years ago!
01:16:06.833,01:16:08.375,Ten fucking years ago.
01:16:09.958,01:16:12.625,So what? It's a chance to start over.
01:16:17.125,01:16:18.541,"I'm 40, Angela."
01:16:20.541,01:16:22.000,And you're wonderful.
01:16:22.916,01:16:24.000,You are wonderful.
01:16:26.916,01:16:30.083,But maybe it's not a great idea to make long-term plans with me.
01:16:37.000,01:16:39.166,And now someone has to be the adult.
01:16:40.166,01:16:42.666,"And judging by our birth dates, it has to be me."
01:16:45.375,01:16:47.083,"One day you'll understand, Angela."
01:16:48.041,01:16:49.375,One day you'll understand.
01:17:31.666,01:17:34.333,-Something happened. -I'll take a smoke break.
01:17:44.375,01:17:45.875,Don't tell anyone.
01:17:47.875,01:17:49.041,He left me.
01:17:57.500,01:17:58.333,Sit down.
01:17:59.208,01:18:00.583,"What happened, hmm?"
01:18:01.291,01:18:02.208,Tell me.
01:18:05.083,01:18:07.375,He said that we can't think long-term.
01:18:20.208,01:18:21.916,And then he told me to leave.
01:18:30.000,01:18:32.333,-Everything okay? Are you okay? -Yes.
01:18:33.833,01:18:35.416,I'll go get a glass of water.
01:18:48.291,01:18:49.166,Here we go.
01:18:49.833,01:18:52.916,Zeus came down from Mount Olympus to save his daughter Athena.
01:18:58.250,01:19:00.083,"Bravo, bravo!"
01:19:00.166,01:19:02.000,"I will ruin you, I swear."
01:19:02.541,01:19:04.708,"You slept with my daughter, your student."
01:19:04.791,01:19:06.791,And it's your fault that Maria got in that car.
01:19:09.000,01:19:12.000,You're an accomplice. Which is a good reason to lie.
01:19:12.083,01:19:13.708,I'll ask you one last time.
01:19:13.791,01:19:16.541,"On Sunday, did you leave before or after the boy?"
01:19:21.250,01:19:30.291,"I mean… makes sense, if we're talking about eroticism."
01:19:30.375,01:19:37.916,"But I've always found orgies a bit sad, and when I saw we were too many, I… I offered Maria a ride home."
01:19:39.416,01:19:41.875,But she didn't want to go back to her dad.
01:19:42.916,01:19:49.125,So… I left… before the boy.
01:19:51.708,01:19:55.041,"Plus, I already had a nice damsel waiting for me in my bed."
01:20:05.541,01:20:07.916,Sorry… you're ridiculous.
01:20:10.125,01:20:11.500,"You can't help it, huh?"
01:20:20.750,01:20:21.791,"Roberto, come."
01:20:22.833,01:20:23.791,Look.
01:20:30.750,01:20:35.250,Things that once for him were unthinkable suddenly became a reality.
01:20:36.291,01:20:41.750,He was… like a ticking time bomb… What is this?
01:20:42.916,01:20:46.791,A video of Maria Spezi that was filmed secretly during a class.
01:20:46.875,01:20:49.833,"They just posted it, and it already has more than 800 views."
01:20:50.625,01:20:55.666,How is it possible that nobody ever noticed all these red flags?
01:20:55.750,01:20:59.250,"If you show your fears, you're poking the beast."
01:20:59.333,01:21:04.333,"So, I hid them, and I still do… -What happened to you? -Nothing."
01:21:04.416,01:21:06.750,"So, you still think he's innocent?"
01:21:09.500,01:21:14.166,And… And I would fall asleep on the chair next to his impromptu bed.
01:21:15.208,01:21:20.083,I'd wake up and find him staring at me with those empty-looking eyes.
01:21:22.625,01:21:30.708,"His eternal anger towards the city, for an unjust arrest that occurred years prior, had transformed into rage against the entire universe."
01:21:31.250,01:21:41.583,A universe that probably wouldn't do any more right by him -than his own community. -These people… A community that he now saw as ruthless and corrupted.
01:21:42.666,01:21:51.166,"And after my mom died, a strange reversal took place. I… I became the parent and he the child."
01:21:52.708,01:22:09.375,I thought it'd be a temporary condition due to his drinking… I started realizing that the situation was never going to change.
01:22:10.250,01:22:12.333,And I was never going to be free.
01:22:17.291,01:22:19.666,That I would never be free.
01:22:23.125,01:22:29.375,"3,700 VIEWS The end."
01:23:50.416,01:23:51.416,Hey.
01:23:52.625,01:23:53.791,What did you do?
01:23:56.000,01:23:59.583,"This morning, six of our best clients canceled their contracts."
01:24:00.375,01:24:02.083,I've been on the phone for hours.
01:24:03.041,01:24:08.250,"They say that you're… unstable, and violent."
01:24:11.333,01:24:23.875,"WALTER SPEZI ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS Maria… No, wait, please."
01:24:35.375,01:24:36.250,Emma!
01:24:45.250,01:24:48.000,Emma! The clients that canceled their contracts.
01:24:52.416,01:24:55.666,It makes sense. They're all Pilati's friends.
01:24:56.666,01:24:58.541,Now let's check the backups.
01:24:58.625,01:25:00.916,"Oh, I just dumped everything."
01:25:01.750,01:25:03.250,Because of a court order.
01:25:04.166,01:25:07.166,How many times have I told you we don't erase anything? Client one.
01:25:16.291,01:25:17.791,Client five.
01:25:18.333,01:25:20.208,Look at this. Look.
01:25:22.291,01:25:24.083,Maria was already wounded.
01:25:30.625,01:25:32.041,Spezi didn't do it.
01:25:46.625,01:25:47.458,Maria?
01:25:48.166,01:25:51.041,"Come to class today, come on, please."
01:25:51.125,01:25:52.208,Stefano is back too.
01:25:54.708,01:25:55.916,I'll go in with you.
01:26:13.083,01:26:15.416,This is for Mr. and Mrs. Grassi. You got it?
01:26:19.458,01:26:21.166,-What happened? -Never mind.
01:26:21.250,01:26:24.041,Dario lied to you. He lied to both of us.
01:26:24.541,01:26:26.458,And this will only make things worse.
01:26:27.833,01:26:31.208,He absolutely has to tell the truth. He has to go to the police.
01:26:32.416,01:26:33.833,"If you want, I'll take him."
01:26:56.916,01:26:58.791,I was your chief electrician.
01:27:01.166,01:27:04.750,Now I'm lucky if someone lets me fix their toaster.
01:27:07.750,01:27:10.166,Imagine if my wife saw us now.
01:27:10.833,01:27:12.791,She'd say we're two undesirables.
01:27:14.541,01:27:15.791,Two rejects.
01:27:18.875,01:27:22.083,Why did you say it was your fault when they found you with Maria?
01:27:23.333,01:27:24.416,Because it's true.
01:27:25.041,01:27:27.875,We had a fight that afternoon because of my drinking.
01:27:29.375,01:27:37.333,"Uh, she ran off, and I was too drunk… to go after her. That's the point."
01:27:38.166,01:27:39.583,I should've stopped her.
01:27:40.166,01:27:43.833,"Everything that happened is my fault, because I'm a useless jackass."
01:27:46.291,01:27:50.083,"I wish she had written about the good times, in her essay."
01:27:50.666,01:27:53.291,-Because there were some. -I remember.
01:27:58.875,01:28:08.041,Roberto… After that incident… with Angela.
01:28:09.333,01:28:11.583,You had to fire me. I get it.
01:28:11.666,01:28:13.458,-But you know… -Walter.
01:28:15.041,01:28:16.458,I owe you an apology.
01:28:18.583,01:28:20.250,We all owe you an apology.
01:28:30.208,01:28:33.500,One carefree and playful roundabout in paradise.
01:28:39.041,01:28:41.416,"But when I got there, the carousel was broken."
01:28:43.416,01:28:47.750,My mom never left the door unlocked or a seat belt unbuckled.
01:28:49.333,01:28:52.416,"If she saw a dog on the street, she'd call the pound."
01:28:53.208,01:28:54.750,-That's why… -Angela!
01:28:54.833,01:28:57.291,…losing a daughter… Angela!
01:28:57.916,01:29:00.000,…shook her world to the core.
01:29:02.958,01:29:03.791,Angela!
01:29:21.166,01:29:22.583,How did you meet?
01:29:23.708,01:29:24.750,At Bagno Gilda.
01:29:28.291,01:29:32.666,He… loved it when girls would get turned on by me.
01:29:34.333,01:29:37.833,He kept saying that… I made him feel younger.
01:29:42.750,01:29:48.166,"And then one day, he told me that if I wanted, I could use his place to get laid."
01:29:49.333,01:29:50.541,And I accepted.
01:29:53.541,01:29:54.875,Without a second thought.
01:29:59.791,01:30:04.500,The only rule was that I always had to do it in… his study.
01:30:05.166,01:30:12.166,"Never in his bedroom. And I remember thinking that… At first, I thought that it had more to do with germs, hygiene."
01:30:15.041,01:30:19.458,But then… I found out the real reason.
01:31:07.083,01:31:08.416,It's not a good thing.
01:31:08.500,01:31:09.750,I'm not proud of it.
01:31:11.833,01:31:13.041,I fucked up.
01:31:14.583,01:31:19.125,But I thought that it was all about sleeping with these girls.
01:31:19.208,01:31:23.083,"And they were all consenting. This you can verify, if you want."
01:31:27.000,01:31:28.541,Pilati paid you to do this?
01:31:29.041,01:31:32.000,Yes… in cash.
01:31:32.625,01:31:34.875,And sometimes he'd give me a bonus.
01:31:37.000,01:31:38.166,Tell me about Maria.
01:31:42.750,01:31:49.000,but I only wanted someone to make the carousel spin again… Where is the mechanic?
01:31:49.083,01:31:52.916,And there he was… The man who fixed everything.
01:31:55.333,01:31:59.583,"I was sure that with his magic, he could make it spin again for me."
01:32:01.791,01:32:05.708,Little did he know about the tragic coincidence that was about to befall him.
01:32:06.916,01:32:09.208,Such an innocent moment.
01:32:10.791,01:32:16.958,Such a disastrous result… With Maria it was different.
01:32:19.500,01:32:20.625,Everything went wrong.
01:32:23.125,01:32:25.666,She was clearly much younger than the others.
01:32:27.166,01:32:34.583,"But… if Pilati didn't care, I kept filling up the glass, like I did with all the other girls."
01:32:37.666,01:32:45.416,That guy who knew her… No! Don't leave!
01:32:46.458,01:32:48.833,-Please. -I have to go.
01:32:51.875,01:32:54.791,Pilati couldn't… stop staring at her.
01:32:56.250,01:32:59.166,It seemed almost as if he was touching her with his eyes.
01:33:01.916,01:33:06.958,And then I realized that he was having… an erection.
01:33:12.833,01:33:13.666,Sorry.
01:33:13.750,01:33:14.958,I was never scared.
01:33:16.958,01:33:19.875,Actually… I was almost fascinated.
01:33:21.041,01:33:26.083,It was more like looking at a horse peeing in the street.
01:33:38.750,01:33:45.250,"But only once because she was… She was too drunk, and I couldn't do it."
01:33:45.333,01:33:46.791,I felt lame.
01:33:49.375,01:33:53.375,And I thought that maybe first we should've made her some coffee.
01:33:57.000,01:34:03.291,"But… It didn't help at all, because she fell asleep right away."
01:34:09.208,01:34:13.125,Then… he was there with me.
01:34:17.750,01:34:25.083,"He started unbuttoning her shirt, but, very slowly, because he wanted to be careful not to touch her skin."
01:34:25.166,01:34:31.625,"And he looked at me with an expression, as if to say, Let's switch, now it's your turn. And I said no."
01:34:32.333,01:34:34.666,"I said I couldn't do it, I didn't feel like it."
01:34:35.541,01:34:40.291,And he… He got very mad and threw me out.
01:34:43.916,01:34:45.375,I was very drunk.
01:34:46.583,01:34:51.500,"I don't remember anything, only… that I broke this camera, Roberto's."
01:34:53.833,01:34:55.583,Then I heard Maria screaming.
01:35:01.458,01:35:14.333,"All the ingredients were there: a man with his penis in his hand, a curious little girl, a mother consumed and blinded by panic… I was crying, yes… but only because I bit my lip when I fell."
01:35:16.250,01:35:17.541,I tried to tell my mom.
01:35:18.166,01:35:22.791,"I tried to tell her that it was pee, not sperm, on Spezi's pants."
01:35:30.208,01:35:32.833,"Pilati went, like, crazy."
01:35:35.333,01:35:36.833,He was hitting her.
01:35:39.041,01:35:41.333,He was kicking her in the back of the head.
01:35:41.416,01:35:42.291,Really hard.
01:35:43.208,01:35:58.000,"And… And he wanted to put her back in the chair, so he grabbed her by the arm, but… …he pulled too hard."
01:36:00.125,01:36:03.250,It's a miracle that arm didn't come off.
01:36:09.291,01:36:12.416,And he started to yell at me as if it was my fault.
01:36:16.541,01:36:20.166,"He told me, I had to try."
01:36:20.250,01:36:22.125,I had to try! You understand?
01:36:22.916,01:36:25.625,I had to! I didn't think I'd feel it.
01:36:26.875,01:36:38.500,"Death! I didn't think I'd feel it, death on her flesh… Get her out of here."
01:36:39.125,01:36:40.000,Go away.
01:37:01.791,01:37:09.166,"It had to be my mother's. Born out of fear, that would first of all absolve her from having lost sight of me."
01:37:10.875,01:37:12.291,The thing she loves the most.
01:37:14.250,01:37:16.000,I never understood this whole thing.
01:37:16.791,01:37:18.666,Because I never understood my mom.
01:37:21.416,01:37:22.333,But now I do.
01:37:28.416,01:37:32.083,It would've been a much better story if I had been traumatized.
01:37:32.708,01:37:34.250,Much more interesting.
01:37:35.833,01:37:37.166,Probably.
01:37:37.916,01:37:39.875,But that's not the story I'm telling.
01:37:48.250,01:37:52.208,"And FYI, the long key opens his front door."
01:37:52.916,01:37:53.833,He's all yours.
01:38:04.250,01:38:09.166,She was… She was so… scared of me.
01:38:11.083,01:38:14.958,She… She jumped out of the car.
01:38:18.458,01:38:25.916,"I was looking for her when Roberto stopped me, I wanted to help her."
01:38:27.041,01:38:36.708,But… Fuck.
01:38:38.625,01:38:40.375,That guy… He's going to kill me.
01:38:44.750,01:38:46.458,Don't worry. Hmm?
01:38:54.916,01:38:57.833,What was in the tox screen other than alcohol?
01:38:58.333,01:39:00.458,"I told you, only a painkiller."
01:39:01.250,01:39:02.125,Oxycodone.
01:40:38.333,01:40:39.708,At least tell me the truth.
01:40:40.791,01:40:41.708,It's the truth.
01:40:42.208,01:40:43.541,-Right. -Yes.
01:40:44.208,01:40:45.666,But that's not the reason.
01:40:48.333,01:40:50.125,"Our marriage is done, Claudia."
01:40:51.791,01:40:52.958,We both know it.
01:40:59.125,01:41:00.750,"Tell me something, Roberto."
01:41:01.458,01:41:03.916,You really want to throw everything away?
01:41:04.000,01:41:05.541,Everything we've built?
01:41:06.125,01:41:09.500,"The business, the family, your career?"
01:41:11.458,01:41:12.291,For what?
01:41:12.916,01:41:14.125,Huh?
01:41:14.208,01:41:17.625,For… for a messed-up woman with a delinquent son?
01:41:18.250,01:41:20.583,Or because you want to feel 19 again?
01:41:22.333,01:41:23.708,Are you sure it's love?
01:41:24.541,01:41:26.541,Maybe it's another form of sleepwalking?
01:41:27.791,01:41:28.833,Honestly?
01:41:29.916,01:41:30.750,I don't know.
01:41:32.958,01:41:35.125,But I feel it's worth the risk.
01:42:00.625,01:42:02.500,But there is one thing I have to ask.
01:42:03.625,01:42:08.125,Did you know that Ferrario's staff erased more than just the footage from the fundraiser?
01:42:11.541,01:42:12.375,I knew it.
01:42:13.000,01:42:14.458,"Claudia, Pilati is a bad man."
01:42:14.541,01:42:15.958,That man is sick.
01:42:18.208,01:42:20.416,He has the money to get himself out of anything.
01:42:21.541,01:42:22.666,But something's strange.
01:42:22.750,01:42:28.916,"I can't stop wondering how it's possible that he made Maria coffee to sober her up, but she fell asleep."
01:42:29.416,01:42:30.250,"Weird, right?"
01:42:33.625,01:42:35.000,"Claudia, she could've died."
01:42:45.083,01:42:47.166,That man made me feel alive again.
01:42:48.166,01:42:54.625,"Whoever he is, whatever Pilati may have done, he made me feel something I hadn't felt in a while."
01:42:54.708,01:42:59.333,"That I had forgotten… But this is my problem, not yours."
01:42:59.833,01:43:01.791,"However, I can tell you this, Roberto."
01:43:02.666,01:43:04.916,I'll never let a man disappoint me again.
01:43:05.625,01:43:06.458,Never again.
01:43:45.041,01:43:45.875,Who are you?
01:43:47.541,01:43:49.500,"I'm Maria's father, Walter Spezi."
01:43:50.291,01:43:51.291,What do you want?
01:43:52.333,01:43:54.875,I want to know what happened Sunday night.
01:43:55.833,01:44:10.208,"Mr. Spezi, I'm sorry, but unfortunately, here… everything's been cleared up. The parties, the drugs… I'm furious with that pig, Dario, who took advantage of the privilege of being my custodian for a long time."
01:44:10.291,01:44:13.791,Because Maria wasn't the only one he brought here to do his business.
01:44:13.875,01:44:18.500,"No, look. I'm telling you, if you have any issues, you should talk to that kid."
01:44:18.583,01:44:20.791,"Talk to him. Dario Nobile, he lives here."
01:44:20.875,01:44:22.708,"On Via… Donati, I think."
01:44:24.000,01:44:27.041,-But Roberto… -Let me tell you something about Santini.
01:44:27.125,01:44:30.000,He's banging Dario's mom. The whole town knows.
01:44:30.083,01:44:32.083,"Obviously, he's protecting the kid."
01:44:32.666,01:44:36.291,"I'm sorry, Mr. Spezi, really. Now, excuse me, but I have to go."
01:45:17.333,01:45:18.208,Bye!
01:45:23.541,01:45:25.000,I talked to Claudia.
01:45:25.750,01:45:26.791,I told her everything.
01:45:28.416,01:45:29.416,And what did she say?
01:45:30.791,01:45:32.625,"Mom, there's a scary man!"
01:45:34.875,01:45:37.000,"-Walter, Walter! -You're a liar!"
01:45:37.083,01:45:38.583,-What the fuck? -I'll kill you!
01:45:38.666,01:45:39.791,-Walter! -Let me go!
01:45:40.791,01:45:42.791,There's a man here! He's trying to kill my son!
01:45:42.875,01:45:44.000,-Walter! -Let me go!
01:45:44.083,01:45:45.250,-Look at me! -Let me go!
01:45:48.583,01:45:50.291,-Let me go! -Dario didn't do it!
01:45:50.375,01:45:51.958,It was Pilati!
01:45:52.041,01:45:54.833,I swear to you! I swear I'll find the evidence!
01:45:56.041,01:45:57.000,Believe me.
01:46:04.083,01:46:05.291,"It's over, Walter."
01:46:07.541,01:46:08.500,It's over.
01:46:14.041,01:46:18.000,"Yes… Yes, it's over."
01:46:23.500,01:46:25.000,"I'm doomed, anyway."
01:46:39.000,01:46:40.208,It's me they want.
01:46:40.291,01:46:42.000,That's how it's always been.
01:46:52.416,01:46:53.416,Walk forward.
01:46:54.250,01:46:55.791,"Walk forward, Spezi. Come."
01:46:56.458,01:46:57.666,Keep going. Keep going.
01:46:58.625,01:47:01.291,Keep going. Keep going. Stop.
01:47:04.666,01:47:05.875,"Cuff him, Ricciardi."
01:47:08.333,01:47:10.166,"Stop, drop the weapon!"
01:47:12.625,01:47:14.416,"Drop the weapon, Walter!"
01:47:15.708,01:47:17.750,Drop the weapon!
01:48:28.916,01:49:10.041,OXYCODONE Enough!
