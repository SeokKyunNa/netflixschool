00:00:24.441,00:00:28.028,Just because you don't feel sick now doesn't mean you don't need the shot.
00:00:28.111,00:00:30.989,"I never get sick, okay? You can take that and give it to Barry."
00:00:31.072,00:00:34.826,-His nose is always running. -What are you giving me shit for?
00:00:34.909,00:00:38.788,"I saw you earlier today. We said hi. I said, Cole. You said, Mr. Daisy."
00:00:38.872,00:00:42.042,"Why are you giving me shit today? I mean, it's just a needle, man."
00:00:44.169,00:00:47.172,"Damn. Come here, get the shot. Ain't nothing to be scared of."
00:00:47.839,00:00:50.759,"There's 62 kids came here, got a shot, no problem."
00:00:50.842,00:00:54.179,"You come in here, take ten minutes? I got 84 kids more to go. Okay?"
00:00:54.262,00:00:57.223,"We're boys. Be cool. Shit, man. Are you gonna take this shot?"
00:00:57.307,00:01:00.310,"Step over here and take the shot, just like you'd take some ass."
00:01:00.393,00:01:02.604,There's nothing to be scared of.
00:01:03.354,00:01:04.355,I'm not scared.
00:01:16.284,00:01:17.869,Pussy!
00:01:30.632,00:01:32.050,How crazy is that shit?
00:01:32.759,00:01:34.719,His name was literally Oceanus.
00:01:34.803,00:01:36.513,He didn't even have a nationality.
00:01:37.013,00:01:38.973,"Just a citizen of the sea, I guess."
00:01:39.766,00:01:41.434,What class did you learn that in?
00:01:53.696,00:01:55.532,It was his high-school dream car.
00:01:56.741,00:01:59.536,"He got it after the divorce to make Mom jealous, but..."
00:02:03.873,00:02:06.209,"Dad, can we give Cole a ride home?"
00:02:07.001,00:02:09.754,"Cole, are your parents expecting you to take the bus home?"
00:02:11.131,00:02:12.549,"-I guess so. -Yeah, they are."
00:02:12.632,00:02:14.551,"So, you should take the bus, okay, sport?"
00:02:14.926,00:02:17.178,"Sorry, dude. I'll see you, though, neighbor, huh?"
00:02:17.720,00:02:18.888,-I didn't-- -What's that?
00:02:46.583,00:02:47.876,"Well, well, well."
00:02:52.255,00:02:53.756,I don't know. Okay?
00:02:53.840,00:02:56.301,"Well, speaking of hanging, have your balls dropped yet?"
00:03:01.181,00:03:02.056,I didn't catch that.
00:03:02.765,00:03:05.685,"I said, Why are you so interested in my balls?"
00:03:05.768,00:03:07.645,Last thing he cares about is your balls.
00:03:10.565,00:03:11.399,The sophomore?
00:03:11.900,00:03:15.111,"The sophomore. But in many ways, she was a senior."
00:03:15.737,00:03:18.198,-I don't believe you. -You don't need to believe him.
00:03:18.281,00:03:20.909,It's not like your belief will validate what happens to his dick.
00:03:20.992,00:03:22.035,Wanna know how it was?
00:03:24.329,00:03:25.496,"No, not really."
00:03:25.580,00:03:32.128,"Well, see, as a 14-year-old in that kind of situation with a 16-year-old that looks like Shelly MacEntyre, it was overwhelming, man."
00:03:32.795,00:03:34.297,"I mean, she is a woman."
00:03:38.051,00:03:39.594,"Man, you know what I'm saying?"
00:03:41.471,00:03:43.389,"I said, do you know what I'm saying?"
00:03:44.098,00:03:46.726,You just said it didn't matter if I believed you.
00:03:46.809,00:03:58.446,"-Well, I changed my mind, bitch. -Sorry, I wasn't-- Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. Ooh-whah, ooh-whah."
00:04:06.537,00:04:07.747,Did you just touch Cole?
00:04:11.042,00:04:13.628,You so much as think about Cole again...
00:04:15.922,00:04:17.048,and I'm gonna...
00:04:22.345,00:04:23.263,You crazy bitch.
00:04:30.186,00:04:32.188,"Before I run you over, you little Pap smear."
00:04:39.070,00:04:39.904,These are new.
00:04:40.613,00:04:42.824,"Yeah, I have to wear them sometimes."
00:04:42.907,00:04:48.621,"They supposedly help strengthen my left eye, -but I can't tell the difference. -You look pretty strong to me."
00:04:49.872,00:04:50.790,You skin your palms?
00:04:51.624,00:04:53.918,"-It doesn't hurt. -Yeah, it does. Come here."
00:05:02.010,00:05:04.512,-They bother you a lot? -No.
00:05:06.264,00:05:09.475,"You look away when you lie, dude. They the ones that egg your house?"
00:05:15.940,00:05:23.990,"And if they're chasing you, wait until they've almost got you, drop like a bag of rocks, then when they trip over you, and they're on the ground, kick them in the dick."
00:05:27.243,00:05:30.204,"-Hey, so, tell me, how's the folks? -Better, I think."
00:05:30.705,00:05:32.165,Hotel therapy's working?
00:05:34.125,00:05:38.046,"I mean, they're happy, we get to hang out, and I get paid."
00:05:41.424,00:05:43.801,"'Cause, like, I have to pay you to hang out with me."
00:05:44.302,00:05:46.095,Are you trying to say prostitute?
00:05:46.596,00:05:50.808,"Oh, my God-- No, that would make me the prostitute and your parents the clients."
00:05:50.892,00:05:53.269,That is a terrible analogy. That is the worst one ever.
00:05:54.354,00:05:57.607,"-Oh... -Besides, I'd wanna hang out with you either way."
00:05:58.358,00:05:59.192,Really?
00:05:59.317,00:06:00.985,One hundred percent.
00:06:01.527,00:06:05.573,I got two years tops before you're too cool to hang out with me.
00:06:05.948,00:06:07.533,I'll never be too cool.
00:06:16.209,00:06:20.588,"I-- I don't care. I mean, my, uh-- Tree houses are for kids anyway."
00:06:21.589,00:06:23.758,"There's a lot of good memories in there, right?"
00:06:25.385,00:06:26.219,Yeah.
00:06:26.552,00:06:29.972,"All right, tomorrow night. You. Me. Party."
00:06:30.807,00:06:31.641,Sounds good.
00:06:42.026,00:06:43.111,E.T. fingers.
00:06:46.364,00:06:48.408,"-All right. See you, Cee. -Bye-bye, Bee."
00:06:51.202,00:06:54.622,"Gotta get that door fixed. You're still giving this to me, right?"
00:06:54.705,00:06:57.625,-One hundred percent. -Can't have a sticky door on my car.
00:07:23.609,00:07:24.485,"Hey, Mom!"
00:07:27.613,00:07:30.408,"Cole, can you hand me one of those traps, please?"
00:07:31.117,00:07:32.076,Ow.
00:07:32.952,00:07:34.287,-Thanks. Hi. -Hi.
00:07:40.042,00:07:42.587,"Mom, how can you be under there? There's like a trillion spiders."
00:07:54.849,00:07:56.017,Um...
00:07:56.559,00:07:57.477,Huh.
00:08:00.771,00:08:08.446,I think... you are at a time in your life where a lot of things are scary.
00:08:08.946,00:08:13.743,"But as you get older, those same things will stop frightening you as much."
00:08:14.327,00:08:15.161,Okay?
00:08:17.747,00:08:18.831,It's gonna be okay.
00:08:23.252,00:08:26.506,What have they done to you? They eat other dirty bugs.
00:08:26.589,00:08:28.257,"Hey, will you get me a lemonade?"
00:08:28.508,00:08:29.342,-Yep. -Thanks.
00:08:31.677,00:08:34.597,"Mom, I know pussy also means vagina. I'm not retarded."
00:08:36.891,00:08:40.436,Cole Johnson. Do not say retarded.
00:08:43.105,00:08:44.232,"Don't say it, okay?"
00:08:44.774,00:08:45.816,Go get me a lemonade.
00:08:50.279,00:08:51.656,"Oh, my God, he said pussy."
00:08:56.911,00:08:59.413,-How those mirrors looking? -Looking good.
00:08:59.497,00:09:00.373,Parking brakes?
00:09:01.332,00:09:02.166,Nope.
00:09:02.250,00:09:04.293,-Hands? -Ten and two.
00:09:05.002,00:09:05.878,Engage.
00:09:11.926,00:09:15.304,"Dad, did you know that seven teenagers die a day from driving?"
00:09:15.680,00:09:17.139,Really? Wow.
00:09:17.473,00:09:21.852,"Did you know that, uh, 14 teenagers die a day from over-worrying?"
00:09:22.520,00:09:31.279,"I went on the Internet, and there's pictures of them. They die like this: Maybe next week."
00:09:32.238,00:09:34.115,"All right, buddy, sure. You wanna swap?"
00:09:34.657,00:09:36.450,-Yeah. -Good. All right. You did good.
00:09:37.243,00:09:39.704,"You started the car, you put the seat belt on."
00:09:39.787,00:09:42.123,"Don't worry about it, pal. There's no rush."
00:09:42.206,00:09:44.917,"It's okay to be scared. It's not a big deal, okay?"
00:09:47.295,00:09:52.049,"Hey, let me ask you something. Do your friends-- Do they make fun of you for having a babysitter?"
00:09:52.592,00:09:53.426,Yeah.
00:09:53.884,00:09:56.012,But then they see her and get really jealous.
00:09:58.889,00:10:01.851,"I don't know about you, buddy, but I'm feeling like a cop."
00:10:02.393,00:10:04.145,I'm craving some donuts.
00:10:18.409,00:10:19.452,What are you watching?
00:10:19.535,00:10:21.829,Your dad is bingeing on Mad Men.
00:10:21.912,00:10:22.872,Again.
00:10:23.372,00:10:24.373,You wouldn't like it.
00:10:25.041,00:10:26.125,It's on HBO?
00:10:28.878,00:10:29.754,It's not on HBO.
00:10:29.837,00:10:32.256,"It's dense, you know. So, it might go over your head."
00:10:32.381,00:10:35.092,"When you get a little older, we'll binge-watch it together."
00:10:35.176,00:10:36.052,How about that?
00:10:39.055,00:10:40.139,in the hallway for me?
00:10:40.222,00:10:41.557,"Okay, Mom. Jeez."
00:10:41.641,00:10:42.475,Thank you.
00:11:14.215,00:11:15.341,Who cares?
00:11:16.676,00:11:17.510,Hey. Oh.
00:11:17.843,00:11:19.762,"Hey, that doesn't seem safe at all."
00:11:19.887,00:11:21.639,"-I can handle it. -Yeah. No, I get it."
00:11:21.722,00:11:22.640,Stop. Stop.
00:11:22.890,00:11:24.266,And hand me the knife.
00:11:25.351,00:11:28.020,Fabulous. Why you cutting up your car with a knife?
00:11:28.813,00:11:32.024,"I'm gonna switch the roof with a fastback, -so it's aerodynamic. -Uh-huh."
00:11:32.108,00:11:34.276,It's gonna give me more downforce on the turns.
00:11:34.360,00:11:41.617,"When it hits the ramp, it'll do a barrel roll and smash into the crash zone exactly how I intend-- Got it, got it. I applaud your passion for aerodynamics."
00:11:41.701,00:11:44.829,"I absolutely do, but only use this if you're cutting a flank steak."
00:11:44.912,00:11:46.455,And don't do that. That's my job.
00:11:46.539,00:11:49.291,"And if you take that job, what am I doing at this house?"
00:11:49.792,00:11:51.252,Do you want me to put it back?
00:11:53.045,00:11:55.172,'cause it's coated in my sweat and fear.
00:11:57.174,00:12:03.347,"My parents are going away again. I think they go to have sex, but it just makes me feel like they go to get away from me."
00:12:04.306,00:12:05.975,They're definitely having sex.
00:12:06.058,00:12:07.935,"They probably have sex when you're home, too."
00:12:08.436,00:12:12.064,"Besides, I bet Bee has boys over at your place all the time doing it."
00:12:12.148,00:12:13.190,Nope. No.
00:12:13.274,00:12:14.567,No way. Not a chance.
00:12:14.942,00:12:17.403,Yeah. That's what babysitters do.
00:12:18.404,00:12:21.657,"They put the kids down, sneak their boyfriends in. Doing it."
00:12:22.616,00:12:25.745,"Seriously, have you ever been awake after she's fallen asleep?"
00:12:26.537,00:12:28.956,I dare you to stay up tonight. You'll see.
00:12:29.915,00:12:31.167,I'm gonna find out.
00:12:31.834,00:12:34.003,-Perv. -No! I'm choking!
00:13:19.757,00:13:23.469,"Honey, not that I'm rushing you, but weren't we supposed to leave at five?"
00:13:25.679,00:13:27.181,We were supposed to leave at five.
00:13:27.264,00:13:29.850,Don't move the furniture around. We just did the floors.
00:13:31.936,00:13:34.522,I don't yell at you. I just speak in all caps.
00:13:34.605,00:13:36.315,Right. That's what I love about her.
00:13:48.244,00:13:50.663,"-What up, Cee? -What up, Bee?"
00:13:56.585,00:13:58.879,-Uh... The Hyatt. Living large. -Mm!
00:13:59.880,00:14:02.842,"Uh, try the bottom drawer under your Invisalign."
00:14:03.551,00:14:05.261,"Um, anyway, you know the drill."
00:14:05.344,00:14:08.138,"No violent movies, no junk food, bed by ten."
00:14:11.642,00:14:13.769,"Uh, there is not a bathing suit in that bedroom."
00:14:22.194,00:14:25.531,"-Well, we'll be fine. I can handle him. -I know. You're the best."
00:14:31.370,00:14:33.414,I will be the envy of women everywhere.
00:14:33.497,00:14:35.958,"Hey, uh, Bee, call us if there's any trouble, okay?"
00:14:38.168,00:14:39.545,"You know what, honey?"
00:14:47.094,00:14:50.264,"Hey, Cole, remember, you're the man of the house now."
00:14:50.639,00:14:51.849,That's sweet. You are.
00:14:51.932,00:14:54.018,"-We love you. Bye, Bee. -I love you. Have fun."
00:15:48.197,00:15:52.409,"So, you're basically saying, intergalactic dream team on a mission."
00:15:52.493,00:15:56.038,"-Yeah. So, there's an epic villain, right? -Right."
00:15:56.121,00:15:58.165,"Okay, so, you have to fill a starship..."
00:15:58.832,00:16:03.295,full of the best people or aliens or robots to take them down.
00:16:03.379,00:16:05.089,-How many seats have I got? -Five.
00:16:05.172,00:16:07.466,"-Five? -Six, if you need, like, a duo."
00:16:07.549,00:16:09.510,But you can't have a Predator and Xenomorph.
00:16:09.593,00:16:11.387,They'd fight. The mission would be futile.
00:16:11.470,00:16:12.805,"No, no, okay, I get it."
00:16:13.681,00:16:16.100,All right. One... Kirk.
00:16:16.225,00:16:17.226,"Two, Picard."
00:16:17.309,00:16:20.688,"Three, Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum from Independence Day."
00:16:20.771,00:16:24.942,"Five, Ripley, and six... Are you ready for this shit?"
00:16:25.025,00:16:26.860,A Xenomorph egg.
00:16:27.403,00:16:28.237,-No way. -Yeah.
00:16:29.571,00:16:31.782,Yes. Yes. Okay. Here's the plan.
00:16:31.865,00:16:37.121,"Kirk and Picard team up to captain, then when they get close, they send Will and Goldblum to get inside the lair."
00:16:37.204,00:16:39.123,-They have experience with that. -Fair.
00:16:39.206,00:16:44.795,"Now, this whole time, Ripley's been bitching about the Xenomorph egg and shit, 'cause that's her move."
00:16:45.004,00:16:46.130,But she's gotta do this.
00:16:46.213,00:16:48.590,-It's the only way to save the world. -The universe.
00:16:48.674,00:16:49.550,Right! Exactly!
00:16:49.633,00:16:52.594,"So, Will and Goldblum get her inside the lair."
00:16:52.678,00:16:57.016,"Ripley personally drops off the egg, the facehugger attacks the big bad!"
00:16:57.266,00:17:01.979,"Ripley makes it back to Will and Goldblum, the big bad attacks them, they narrowly escape."
00:17:02.062,00:17:09.445,"Kirk and Picard supply cover as the spacecraft returns home, then they peace out of there. Meanwhile, the big bad starts feeling like shit..."
00:17:14.450,00:17:15.284,He's out!
00:17:20.414,00:17:21.498,Who said he was a he?
00:17:23.250,00:17:26.378,-Shut up. A woman just saved the galaxy. -Are facehuggers female?
00:17:26.920,00:17:28.172,"No, 'cause they got dicks."
00:17:28.255,00:17:31.091,"Oh, so, you're saying it took a dick to save the galaxy."
00:17:34.970,00:17:36.889,-I want a do-over. -No do-overs.
00:17:36.972,00:17:40.392,Come on. Aliens don't abide by our primitive gender stereotypes.
00:17:40.476,00:17:42.352,-What's done is done. -You suck.
00:17:42.436,00:17:47.149,"-You suck, and I hope you die. -You couldn't live without me."
00:17:47.232,00:17:50.569,"It would definitely affect my income. So, you're probably right."
00:17:51.570,00:17:53.113,-Pizza! -Pizza!
00:18:00.746,00:18:03.248,"I told you, you'd make a mistake, and I'd be waiting."
00:18:16.595,00:18:19.932,and I'm gonna whop you on that side of your face.
00:18:21.183,00:18:22.601,And you wanna know something?
00:18:23.102,00:18:25.771,There's not a damn thing you're gonna be able to do about it.
00:18:42.746,00:18:44.873,Think my parents are gonna get a divorce?
00:18:47.209,00:18:48.752,"I don't know, man. I hope not."
00:18:49.628,00:18:52.631,Melanie's parents got divorced. Her mom lives with her boyfriend.
00:18:52.714,00:18:53.799,That's gross.
00:18:55.300,00:18:57.469,Isn't that the cute chick across the street?
00:18:57.928,00:19:00.430,Ms. Dryer is not cute. She's gross.
00:19:00.514,00:19:01.849,Her boyfriend's like 20.
00:19:01.932,00:19:04.518,Not her. Melanie.
00:19:05.853,00:19:08.230,I wouldn't say she's cute.
00:19:08.313,00:19:11.066,"Oh, I would. I would say she's super-duper cute."
00:19:14.403,00:19:16.488,Whatever. You want your tongues to touch.
00:19:17.114,00:19:18.073,Nope. No way.
00:19:18.157,00:19:21.076,"-Oh, you're in denial. -You're an... asshole."
00:19:23.245,00:19:24.997,"Oh, my God. That was so great."
00:19:26.957,00:19:29.543,But you'll be all right if your parents break up.
00:19:29.626,00:19:32.588,I mean... you just gotta take care of yourself.
00:19:33.130,00:19:36.508,"Gotta figure out what you want, and then do what you can to get it."
00:19:45.225,00:19:46.560,"Ah, shit, dude, it's super late."
00:19:47.811,00:19:50.397,"-I'm not tired. -Well, I know you're not. I am."
00:19:55.736,00:19:58.405,"-I don't know, maybe. -I'll make it a double."
00:19:59.114,00:20:01.241,-You'll sleep like a rock. -Okay.
00:20:03.702,00:20:05.287,"Here you are, my good sir."
00:20:06.079,00:20:08.040,Don't say a word of this to your parents.
00:20:09.166,00:20:11.501,My dad lets me drink Mike's all the time.
00:20:11.585,00:20:13.962,"Dude, that is the coolest thing I've ever heard in my life."
00:20:19.927,00:20:21.470,You're not gonna do it with me?
00:20:23.138,00:20:25.057,"All right, sure. I'll be right back."
00:20:47.704,00:20:48.914,You did it without me?
00:20:50.832,00:20:52.251,Cheers.
00:20:53.293,00:20:54.336,Whew.
00:20:58.423,00:21:00.717,"-I'm gonna find out. -Wow, I'm impressed."
00:21:00.801,00:21:03.345,"That's actually pervy, though, watching people do it."
00:21:03.428,00:21:06.640,I'm not a perv. I just wanna know what happens after I go to sleep.
00:21:08.725,00:21:09.601,I gotta go.
00:21:16.400,00:21:17.359,Enter.
00:21:19.027,00:21:19.861,You sleepy?
00:21:20.737,00:21:22.364,"Yeah, I'm really tired."
00:21:23.323,00:21:25.742,"Well, rest up. The party continues tomorrow."
00:21:26.285,00:21:28.912,You need anything? All right.
00:21:28.996,00:21:30.539,-Bee? -Yeah?
00:21:34.001,00:21:37.754,Thanks for knowing me and treating me like I was okay.
00:21:40.841,00:21:42.134,You don't think you're okay?
00:21:49.057,00:21:49.891,I mean...
00:21:52.978,00:21:54.646,"I wanna feel normal, but..."
00:21:58.150,00:22:00.068,I just feel weird most of the time.
00:22:03.822,00:22:04.990,"Well, I like weird."
00:22:06.491,00:22:07.367,All of the time.
00:22:09.202,00:22:12.664,"So, just imagine how all the girls are gonna love you when you're a senior."
00:22:16.501,00:22:17.669,See you in the morning.
00:22:18.211,00:22:19.254,"Good night, dude."
00:22:40.817,00:22:42.361,Ew. Orgy?
00:22:44.988,00:22:45.822,Orgy?
00:23:56.726,00:23:57.561,Truth me.
00:23:58.437,00:24:02.524,"Out of everybody here, who would you want to sleep with the most?"
00:24:07.863,00:24:08.947,Hundred percent.
00:24:09.448,00:24:12.200,"-Come on. -Sam, you're a close second, stud."
00:24:18.290,00:24:20.083,"Bee, truth or dare."
00:24:22.043,00:24:23.170,Dare.
00:24:34.514,00:24:35.515,All right.
00:24:42.272,00:24:43.106,I'm ready.
00:24:52.073,00:24:54.034,-Thank you. -Is that Lord of the Rings?
00:24:54.117,00:24:55.911,That was The Godfather Part II.
00:24:56.161,00:24:57.245,I love her.
00:26:05.021,00:26:06.815,Give me a second to process that shit.
00:26:11.236,00:26:14.531,"Make sure it's real nice and long for you, because I'm black. See that?"
00:26:14.614,00:26:15.865,There you go. Mm.
00:26:19.661,00:26:20.495,Come on.
00:26:28.295,00:26:29.421,"Bee, what the hell?"
00:26:29.504,00:26:32.382,"You give her that romantic shit, and you're gonna lick my face?"
00:26:33.466,00:26:34.968,"Damn, that's all I'm asking."
00:26:37.971,00:26:40.807,Smell good. The spit is nice. Brushed your teeth this morning.
00:27:02.120,00:27:03.246,Make out with her.
00:27:05.373,00:27:09.502,This is kind of weird. I don't even really know you guys.
00:27:22.015,00:27:23.266,Just close your eyes.
00:27:23.683,00:27:24.726,Okay?
00:27:24.809,00:27:26.311,Pretend they're not even here.
00:27:27.228,00:27:28.063,You can do this.
00:27:28.730,00:27:29.773,You got this.
00:27:35.528,00:27:39.032,Just because I close my eyes doesn't mean that they're not here.
00:27:41.409,00:27:42.285,Do you trust me?
00:27:43.953,00:27:44.788,Yes.
00:27:44.871,00:27:46.039,Just relax.
00:27:47.040,00:27:49.250,"It's not weird, okay? We're just having fun."
00:27:52.629,00:27:53.672,There he goes.
00:28:26.621,00:28:27.497,Shh.
00:28:29.165,00:28:32.293,You're helping fulfill a great purpose. Know this.
00:28:32.836,00:28:35.880,I don't wanna fulfill a great porpoise.
00:28:38.341,00:28:39.592,"Yo, I think he did."
00:28:39.676,00:28:41.761,He didn't even get a chance to understand.
00:28:44.639,00:28:45.557,Ready?
00:28:58.236,00:29:01.406,"Wait, hold on. My shit ain't working. I think it ran out of blood."
00:29:02.115,00:29:04.159,"-Oh, shit! -Oh, shit."
00:29:09.998,00:29:12.917,"Max, don't laugh, okay? John, relax. This blood is serving you."
00:29:13.001,00:29:15.587,I did not sign up for this shit to serve me in my mouth.
00:29:15.670,00:29:18.214,This shit's still warm. I think he got a fever.
00:29:18.298,00:29:21.718,"You know what you signed up for. You want to go platinum, John?"
00:29:21.801,00:29:24.429,Things can get messy when you make a deal with the devil.
00:29:24.512,00:29:25.555,Now collect it.
00:29:38.985,00:29:40.403,"Okay, let's go."
00:29:45.158,00:29:47.911,"I just got this shit, you feel me? Thirty percent off."
00:29:47.994,00:29:50.663,Macy's. Top rack. I don't play games.
00:29:50.747,00:29:55.001,"You look like Carrie, -but black. -Carrie would've been better black."
00:29:55.084,00:29:57.629,"She would have been covered in Hennessy, all right?"
00:29:57.712,00:30:00.340,What are you wearing? Looking like Big Bird's side bitch.
00:30:00.423,00:30:03.551,"I just came from a game. That's why I'm wearing this, obviously."
00:30:03.635,00:30:05.011,I was not gonna miss this.
00:30:06.471,00:30:10.308,Look at this shit. That would go viral so hard.
00:30:10.391,00:30:12.185,"I mean, nobody's done human sacrifice."
00:30:12.268,00:30:14.229,People have always done human sacrifice.
00:30:14.312,00:30:18.233,"Yeah, but, like... not in America with hot people."
00:30:18.316,00:30:20.610,"Sonya, get the cases."
00:30:21.069,00:30:27.617,"Listen, when you're done being totally useless, get a rag and wipe Sacrifice Samuel out my damn eye. OMG."
00:30:27.700,00:30:28.785,Hey.
00:30:28.868,00:30:29.869,"Nice one, John."
00:30:32.789,00:30:35.124,I've got Sacrifice Samuel all over me.
00:30:36.167,00:30:37.293,What's in the box?
00:30:42.465,00:30:45.969,"Yo, so, Bee, why do you need the book if you already know what to do?"
00:30:46.094,00:30:48.304,It's like Jesus asking directions to heaven.
00:30:48.513,00:30:49.931,"Just fucking go up, you know?"
00:30:50.473,00:30:57.856,"Well, the Jews have their scrolls, Christians have their Bibles, and the devil has his verses."
00:30:58.398,00:31:00.817,Don't touch it. It's very old and very delicate.
00:31:01.359,00:31:02.277,It's the only one.
00:31:02.986,00:31:05.613,You recite the verse while the blood hits the page.
00:31:05.697,00:31:07.323,"Without it, none of this happens."
00:31:09.325,00:31:13.246,Let's get started before we head upstairs and get the blood of the innocent.
00:31:27.510,00:31:30.471,My name is Cole Johnson. A guy was murdered in my living room.
00:31:30.555,00:31:33.433,"The address is, uh... 2455 Bigby Drive."
00:31:33.516,00:31:36.936,-Can you please send someone? -Are the attackers still in the house?
00:31:37.020,00:31:38.605,They're downstairs having a blast.
00:31:38.688,00:31:40.648,"-How many are there, Cole? -Too many."
00:31:40.732,00:31:44.402,Can you please get my mom? She's at the Hyatt in the city.
00:31:44.569,00:31:45.528,Living large.
00:31:45.612,00:31:49.157,"Of course, Cole. Now listen to me. It's important that you stay hidden."
00:31:50.325,00:32:44.170,"-I gotta protect myself. Thanks. -Do not do that. No, no, no-- Yo, this kid's hobby must be getting bullied."
00:32:45.964,00:32:47.382,He's reading The Secret?
00:32:47.465,00:32:50.051,He's ten years old. What secret he need to know?
00:32:50.551,00:32:51.594,Won't he hear us?
00:32:52.095,00:32:54.973,"With the amount of drugs I gave him? Hell, no."
00:33:01.771,00:33:03.189,"Of course, I have the needle."
00:33:08.361,00:33:11.197,"You know, there is a faster way to get all that blood."
00:33:19.580,00:33:21.833,And then I'd have to find another innocent kid.
00:33:21.916,00:33:25.628,And all of this only works if we get that top-shelf pure shit.
00:33:27.088,00:33:29.340,And Cole is basically a faucet of that for us.
00:33:44.272,00:33:45.732,and your wish comes true.
00:34:09.130,00:34:10.715,"Wait, you gotta give him a Band-Aid."
00:34:10.798,00:34:12.467,Okay. Let's go mix some blood.
00:34:12.550,00:34:13.760,"John, alley-oop."
00:34:19.140,00:34:19.974,Good boy.
00:35:49.105,00:35:50.106,Why is he shirtless?
00:35:51.440,00:35:55.027,-That's your first question? -How can you ask that? Just look at him.
00:35:55.111,00:35:56.195,I still don't get it.
00:36:01.617,00:36:02.869,Give him a cookie.
00:36:05.121,00:36:07.957,"-No, thanks. -Eat the cookie."
00:36:08.541,00:36:11.127,"I just don't really like cookies, okay? Bee knows that."
00:36:13.462,00:36:15.590,You'll feel better if you eat. You fainted.
00:36:15.673,00:36:16.591,"No, I didn't."
00:36:16.674,00:36:17.508,"Yes, you did."
00:36:18.676,00:36:22.305,"After I took your blood, I waited in the room, because something felt off."
00:36:22.388,00:36:27.935,"I crouched behind the door. A few seconds later, you got up, tied a sheet to your bed, threw the sheet out the window."
00:36:28.019,00:36:30.354,"And then you fainted. So, you know..."
00:36:30.438,00:36:32.356,Your blood sugar is low. Eat the cookie.
00:36:38.446,00:36:39.322,Are you mad at me?
00:36:39.906,00:36:41.490,Cookie.
00:36:43.075,00:36:45.411,This is gonna be so good.
00:36:47.079,00:36:47.914,What the...
00:36:48.915,00:36:50.082,"Oh, there you go."
00:36:50.875,00:36:52.001,There you go.
00:36:55.421,00:36:56.422,That's a good boy.
00:37:04.722,00:37:07.266,"-Why are you awake, Cole? -Because I couldn't sleep."
00:37:09.310,00:37:10.895,I was gonna go smoke in the woods.
00:37:13.856,00:37:17.068,"Yeah. You know, like... marijuana."
00:37:17.151,00:37:19.737,"You weren't gonna share with your boy? Come on, man."
00:37:19.820,00:37:22.490,"We could've got high, listen to my mix tape. My shit's fire."
00:37:22.573,00:37:24.951,-I wanna smoke pot. -Why didn't you drink the shot?
00:37:25.034,00:37:27.370,Why is he shirtless? Why did you take my blood?
00:37:27.453,00:37:29.997,-Cole. -Okay. Fine. Because I don't like alcohol.
00:37:30.081,00:37:32.708,I just drank it because I wanted you to think I was cool.
00:37:35.836,00:37:37.755,Why did you give a 12-year-old alcohol?
00:37:37.838,00:37:41.759,'Cause I put shit in that alcohol that makes them conk out for eight hours or more.
00:37:43.386,00:37:44.512,What else did you see?
00:37:45.888,00:37:47.390,I just see you.
00:37:48.182,00:37:51.143,"And these assholes, who I don't know, in my house."
00:37:54.021,00:37:57.358,-Why is his shirt covered in blood? -No one would let me borrow a shirt.
00:37:58.317,00:38:00.361,"-That's not even an answer. -Oh, my God."
00:38:00.444,00:38:03.948,Does he not see the mirror behind him? We can see you cutting the rope.
00:38:05.700,00:38:06.784,"Well, he does now."
00:38:09.161,00:38:11.205,"Aw, it's so cute, you're still cutting the rope."
00:38:11.289,00:38:13.833,"Look at you. You're really trying there, aren't you?"
00:38:15.126,00:38:17.712,-Why are you cutting ropes? -I don't like being tied up.
00:38:17.795,00:38:19.672,-Why do you have a knife? -It was a gift.
00:38:19.755,00:38:20.631,"Oh, my God."
00:38:21.257,00:38:22.633,He's still cutting the ropes.
00:38:23.175,00:38:25.136,"Determined little fucker, aren't you?"
00:38:26.637,00:38:29.140,"Look, I won't tell anyone."
00:38:29.223,00:38:31.684,Okay? You know me. I'm good with secrets.
00:38:32.059,00:38:35.855,I won't tell my parents that you were having an orgy and needed my blood to do it.
00:38:42.445,00:38:44.488,Do you even know what an orgy is?
00:38:45.031,00:38:53.039,"I'm guessing it's something sad people do 'cause they want other sad people to like them, and they can forget for one minute how sad they are in general."
00:38:54.123,00:38:56.000,That's actually a pretty good answer.
00:38:56.625,00:38:58.794,"It was for a science project, okay?"
00:38:59.545,00:39:00.379,The orgy?
00:39:00.921,00:39:02.381,No. The blood.
00:39:02.465,00:39:04.717,Orgy is when a bunch of people have sex together.
00:39:04.800,00:39:06.052,We wouldn't need your blood for that.
00:39:09.055,00:39:10.723,You could've just asked.
00:39:11.307,00:39:13.768,I would've let you have some blood for science.
00:39:13.893,00:39:15.644,I knew you were afraid of needles.
00:39:15.728,00:39:17.688,This was clearly a misunderstanding.
00:39:17.772,00:39:18.939,"Sonya, untie him."
00:39:19.940,00:39:21.984,"I'm sorry we scared you, Cole. We good?"
00:39:28.824,00:39:30.868,-Not good. -Fucking police.
00:39:31.452,00:39:33.204,"Why are the cops outside, Cole?"
00:39:33.537,00:39:35.206,-I don't know. -Did you call them?
00:39:35.289,00:39:40.461,"-No. You said you were in the room. -Makes me think you saw something that scared you enough to call the cops. Right, Cole?"
00:39:43.923,00:39:45.007,"Answer me, Cole."
00:39:45.549,00:40:05.319,"Help! Help! I'm tied up inside! They're about-- Hands up. Don't shoot, man. Black lives matter, too. You feel me?"

00:40:10.366,00:40:11.492,Titty gone!
00:40:11.575,00:40:14.662,Don't you move. Keep your hands up. Nobody move!
00:40:18.999,00:40:23.212,"Chill. You Mexican, right? Look, I speak Spa-- Lo siento, my nigga, lo siento."
00:40:40.479,00:40:41.313,No!
00:40:43.023,00:40:44.275,Harder.
00:40:48.362,00:40:49.405,Whoo!
00:40:49.488,00:40:52.283,"Look, man. Three out of four people got an STD."
00:40:52.450,00:40:54.034,I got two people's blood on me.
00:40:54.535,00:40:57.288,You do the math. I got AIDS. I know I got AIDS.
00:40:57.371,00:40:58.664,You killed him!
00:40:59.165,00:41:01.417,"-Kind of your fault, bud. -Are you insane?"
00:41:01.500,00:41:12.761,"No, Cole. I'm just trying-- I can't go to jail. Y'all killed the cops, man."
00:41:12.845,00:41:14.555,I ain't involved with this shit.
00:41:14.722,00:41:16.098,"It's fine. Max, pick it up."
00:41:19.143,00:41:21.645,They say you either end up in jail or dead.
00:41:22.146,00:41:24.064,"It's gonna be both for me, Bee."
00:41:27.401,00:41:28.986,Just say all clear.
00:41:32.198,00:41:34.116,Stop screaming and act like an adult.
00:41:34.200,00:41:36.076,What's the code? I know you know it.
00:41:36.160,00:41:38.204,Little boy here a nerd. Tell them the codes.
00:41:38.787,00:41:39.705,What's the code?
00:41:52.051,00:41:54.136,You look me in the eyes and tell me the truth.
00:41:54.220,00:41:55.971,What is the code for all clear?
00:42:02.645,00:42:05.022,It's 10-4. Obviously.
00:42:05.105,00:42:07.274,What's we're taking a break to get food?
00:42:11.862,00:42:13.072,Code seven.
00:42:17.618,00:42:19.870,"Ten-four, all clear. We're code seven."
00:42:30.130,00:42:31.382,Should've been a cop.
00:42:37.012,00:42:37.930,Shit.

00:42:48.232,00:42:50.484,"Oh, my God. He shot me in the boob."
00:42:50.568,00:42:53.362,What kind of dick shoots a girl in the boob?
00:42:54.572,00:42:58.200,-I did not sign up for this shit. -Stop complaining. Stop all your whining.
00:42:58.284,00:43:01.203,They're totally gonna stop growing. They weren't even done.
00:43:01.287,00:43:03.122,"Sometimes you gotta settle, all right?"
00:43:03.205,00:43:05.499,"I got a cousin Chantelle, titties flat."
00:43:05.583,00:43:06.917,Personality real good.
00:43:07.001,00:43:08.460,"Ow. Oh, my God."

00:43:12.840,00:43:16.135,-Get away from me with your fucking beret. -She's gonna bleed out.
00:43:17.052,00:43:18.012,What? No.
00:43:18.095,00:43:20.180,"What do you mean, I'm gonna bleed?"
00:43:20.264,00:43:22.433,Can we just stick a tampon in it or something?
00:43:22.933,00:43:25.978,"Oh, my God. We need to call an ambulance, guys."
00:43:26.061,00:43:28.814,I need an ambulance. I don't wanna lose my boob.
00:43:28.897,00:43:29.940,I can't do that.
00:43:31.692,00:43:32.651,Why not?
00:43:32.735,00:43:35.070,Because your boob was shot by a now-dead cop.
00:43:35.154,00:43:36.322,Have fun explaining that.
00:43:36.405,00:43:38.782,"No dude's gonna motorboat these, Bee."

00:56:28.051,00:56:29.511,"No, I'm not like the others."
00:56:29.594,00:56:31.262,I came here to kill people.
00:56:34.224,00:56:36.643,"Yes! That's what I'm talking about, Cole!"
00:56:36.726,00:56:38.436,"Come on, buddy! Whoo!"
00:56:40.939,00:56:42.107,"Come on, Coley."
00:56:42.690,00:56:45.652,"Come on, buddy. I'm right behind you. Move your ass, Cole."
00:56:46.236,00:56:47.487,Whoo!
00:56:48.279,00:56:49.447,Coming for you.
00:56:52.075,00:56:53.618,"Come on, buddy. Get moving."
00:56:57.038,00:56:58.123,"Come on, buddy."
00:56:58.748,00:56:59.582,Let's go!
00:57:00.583,00:57:02.502,Come on! Get up there! Come on!
00:57:05.672,00:57:08.091,Come down and play.
00:57:12.429,00:57:13.388,Coley.
00:57:16.182,00:57:17.016,"Come on, Cole."
00:57:19.519,00:57:28.820,"Chi-chi-chi, chi-chi-chi, ah Chi-chi-chi, chi-chi-chi, ah Stuck in the tree."
00:57:29.237,00:57:30.947,No way down!
00:57:33.450,00:57:35.410,Coley.
00:57:38.413,00:57:40.748,Coley.
00:57:42.917,00:57:44.210,Coley.
00:58:13.698,00:58:14.657,"Relax, Max."
00:58:17.994,00:58:19.496,You don't have to do this.
00:58:19.579,00:58:22.165,"Well, I kind of have to do this."
00:58:23.833,00:58:26.878,Don't worry. I'm not gonna let you die with egg on your face.
00:58:27.712,00:58:29.005,You poor bastard.
00:58:29.088,00:58:30.924,You deserve better than this.
00:58:37.931,00:58:40.183,Tonight you get an honorable death.
00:58:40.683,00:58:42.560,Tonight you die a man.
00:58:43.478,00:58:44.604,I don't wanna die a man.
00:59:06.251,00:59:07.835,Why are there guns?
00:59:18.012,00:59:19.305,Come here. Come here.
00:59:20.557,00:59:23.142,-Was that a gun? -I got the two guys and the Asian girl.
00:59:23.226,00:59:25.979,-The cheerleader got shot. It's just Bee. -What is going on?
00:59:26.062,00:59:29.148,Bee murdered the geek. Stole my blood. Tied me up. Killed the cops.
00:59:29.232,00:59:31.568,-You're really freaking me out. -I'm... sorry.
00:59:32.944,00:59:33.778,Bee is bad?
00:59:35.780,00:59:37.073,Yeah. Bee is bad.
00:59:37.657,00:59:39.701,-Where's your dad? -Out with some Protestant.
00:59:39.784,00:59:42.996,-But his car's here. -She picked him up. He's really desperate.
00:59:43.496,00:59:45.748,Am I the only one that still has a babysitter?
00:59:46.499,00:59:47.375,Yeah.
00:59:48.334,00:59:50.420,"-So, what do we do? -Pray."
00:59:51.379,00:59:53.506,-Okay. -I was kidding.
00:59:53.590,00:59:55.883,"-Oh. -But it's probably a great idea, though."
01:00:00.471,01:00:01.306,Come on.
01:00:09.731,01:00:12.066,-You think she can get in here? -Not if it's locked.
01:02:21.028,01:02:23.990,-I shouldn't have gotten you into this. -You were being shot at.
01:02:24.073,01:02:25.908,Especially because I was being shot at.
01:02:25.992,01:02:28.828,"You're my best friend, I'm sorry. I'm gonna take care of this."
01:02:28.911,01:02:30.288,-Do you have your phone? -Yeah.
01:02:30.371,01:02:33.916,-Call the cops. Tell them it's a 10-53. -Why do you know cop codes?
01:02:34.459,01:02:37.462,Because I used to wanna be a cop when I grew up.
01:02:39.464,01:02:40.715,You never told me that.
01:02:41.257,01:02:43.176,I know. I only told Bee.
01:02:46.971,01:02:47.805,Are you okay?
01:02:50.183,01:02:51.476,I've had a really bad night.
01:03:02.612,01:03:06.991,Uh... The last guy I saw get kissed got stabbed in the head by two knives.
01:03:11.329,01:03:14.081,Just because she's a psychopath doesn't mean women are evil.
01:03:16.209,01:03:17.126,I know that.
01:03:20.421,01:03:21.881,I wish all girls were like you.
01:03:26.803,01:03:28.137,I'm gonna put an end to this.
01:03:29.096,01:03:29.972,What are you doing?
01:03:30.056,01:03:32.558,"-Keeping you safe. -The lock is on the inside, dumbass."
01:03:35.394,01:03:36.604,That was sweet of you.
01:03:39.816,01:03:41.317,I'm really excited we kissed.
01:03:41.901,01:03:43.986,"Me, too. Let's make out next time."
01:03:45.321,01:03:46.155,Okay. Bye.
01:03:51.619,01:03:53.246,"Come and get me, Bee!"
01:03:54.288,01:03:55.414,I'm right here!
01:03:55.623,01:03:56.958,It's just you and me!
01:03:57.250,01:03:58.543,It's just you and me!
01:03:59.210,01:04:00.878,"What, you're gonna get shy now?!"
01:04:01.629,01:04:03.214,I'm going towards my house!
01:04:03.464,01:04:04.757,"I'm right here, Bee!"
01:04:04.924,01:04:06.092,I'm right here!
01:04:08.803,01:04:09.971,What the hell?
01:04:10.888,01:04:12.807,"Oh, my God. Where is everything?"
01:04:20.648,01:04:21.899,"Oh, my God."
01:06:07.922,01:06:11.008,Sacrifice... Get your dreams...
01:06:17.598,01:06:19.809,-Get off me! -I'm gonna kill you!
01:06:20.768,01:06:22.228,I'm gonna kill you!
01:06:24.522,01:06:25.815,"Oh, my God!"
01:06:25.898,01:06:27.024,"Oh, my God!"
01:06:28.234,01:06:30.695,"What's wrong with you, you little pervert?"
01:06:30.778,01:06:34.198,What? You can't make me feel bad because I defended myself.
01:06:34.281,01:06:38.285,"I knew you wanted me this whole time, upstairs in your little room jerking off."
01:06:38.369,01:06:40.830,-You're just sick. -You were trying to kill me.
01:06:40.913,01:06:43.457,I wasn't trying to kill you by punching your dick.
01:06:47.169,01:06:48.004,"Oh, God."
01:06:48.546,01:06:52.174,I only signed up for this dumb shit so I could have my dream job.
01:06:52.258,01:06:54.176,"And instead, what do I have now, huh?"
01:06:55.344,01:06:56.178,This.
01:07:04.687,01:07:08.983,I-- I mean... you're still super hot.
01:07:09.066,01:07:10.776,What kind of job do you want?
01:07:12.820,01:07:13.654,Journalist.
01:07:17.074,01:07:18.576,"See, that's perfect."
01:07:18.784,01:07:24.040,"Because you're super smart, and you're hot, -and really driven. -Thank you."
01:07:24.123,01:07:28.544,"I could be wrong, but I don't think it would be hard for you to have a cool life."
01:07:29.211,01:07:30.046,Really?
01:07:30.546,01:07:33.799,You think so? You think maybe we could walk out of this whole thing?
01:07:34.550,01:07:38.054,"Just call the police and just, you know, forget this ever happened?"
01:07:38.137,01:07:38.971,Yeah.
01:07:39.472,01:07:40.306,Exactly.
01:07:40.389,01:07:43.601,Do you think I give a fuck what you're talking about?
01:08:01.494,01:08:03.079,Oh! Dishwasher.
01:08:05.706,01:08:06.540,Mom.
01:08:08.542,01:08:11.045,Are you the one that put the knife in the dishwasher?
01:08:11.629,01:08:12.463,I think so.
01:08:12.630,01:08:15.049,Can you not do that? It goes in the butcher block.
01:08:18.135,01:08:19.136,Yoo-hoo!
01:08:20.763,01:08:21.806,Looking for this?
01:08:22.681,01:08:23.974,You still think I'm pretty?
01:08:32.066,01:08:34.527,"Oh, you think I'm scared of a little fire, huh?"
01:08:34.610,01:08:36.195,You are dying.
01:08:36.529,01:08:38.489,"You, you are dying."
01:08:38.781,01:08:40.074,You ruined my life.
01:08:41.075,01:08:45.121,"And now, I'm gonna ruin yours!"
01:08:51.669,01:08:53.337,Holy shit.
01:08:56.257,01:08:58.676,I found this in the cop car. That was so graphic.
01:09:01.262,01:09:02.721,She was so annoying.
01:09:05.724,01:09:06.809,I wanna throw up.
01:09:06.892,01:09:07.852,You and me both.
01:09:09.270,01:09:10.104,Where's Sonya?
01:09:10.396,01:09:12.481,Blown up. Crawlspace. Where are the cops?
01:09:12.565,01:09:13.858,Ditched them with the car.
01:09:15.401,01:09:16.777,Now I gotta skip town again.
01:09:17.278,01:09:19.363,"And that leaves you, and what to do with you."
01:09:19.446,01:09:22.283,-Any suggestions? -Are you gonna shoot me?
01:09:22.825,01:09:23.659,No.
01:09:24.076,01:09:27.830,"No. I was just shooting around you, 'cause I thought you'd put your hands up."
01:09:31.750,01:09:33.043,I will burn your book!
01:09:36.380,01:09:37.214,Cole.
01:09:39.466,01:09:42.803,"-Cole, listen to me. -No."
01:09:42.887,01:09:45.139,"-Cole, listen to me. -No, Bee! You listen to me!"
01:09:46.223,01:09:53.981,"I've been hunted, you've stolen my blood, killed people, shot at me, and just been general assholes all night."
01:09:54.064,01:09:56.942,"So, I wanna know what the hell's going on."
01:09:57.359,01:10:00.738,"Cole, you're too young to understand, okay? Just trust me."
01:10:00.821,01:10:01.947,Fuck you!
01:10:02.031,01:10:02.865,Cole.
01:10:02.948,01:10:04.700,No. You know what? You deserved that.
01:10:04.783,01:10:11.874,"What, just because I'm 12 means I get to be treated like total shit by you and Jeremy and everyone else?"
01:10:11.957,01:10:14.835,You know what? You're Don Draper from Mad Men.
01:10:15.085,01:10:21.008,"How he's all cool and handsome and everybody loves him, then he goes home and you find out he has a wife the whole time."
01:10:21.091,01:10:24.637,-He's such a piece of shit! -Did you just ruin Mad Men for me?
01:10:25.471,01:10:27.514,It's not even on anymore. You'll live.
01:10:27.598,01:10:28.724,Still.
01:10:31.227,01:10:34.146,-What happens when you leave here? -What do you mean?
01:10:34.230,01:10:35.940,-I will burn this! -Okay.
01:10:36.148,01:10:38.609,Cole... what do you want to know?
01:10:41.237,01:10:42.321,What's the blood for?
01:10:42.655,01:10:49.828,"You mix the blood of the innocent with the blood of someone sacrificed, recite the verses, while dripping it on the page."
01:10:50.871,01:10:53.082,"And, basically, you get whatever you want."
01:10:56.710,01:11:00.798,I used to be so small... and so scared.
01:11:03.425,01:11:06.845,Now I'm strong... and I'm confident...
01:11:08.597,01:11:10.224,and that's all I ever wanted.
01:11:13.727,01:11:15.521,"And, so, that's all I was to you."
01:11:18.857,01:11:21.568,You just used me to get what you wanted.
01:11:22.695,01:11:23.529,No.
01:11:25.239,01:11:26.782,"No, Cole. I chose you."
01:11:28.284,01:11:31.912,"I mean, I could've shot you and not Allison, but I didn't. I chose you."
01:11:32.621,01:11:33.914,'Cause you're the best.
01:11:34.623,01:11:36.250,"We click, right? You're my guy."
01:11:40.713,01:11:42.548,"I'm not the first kid, am I?"
01:11:49.138,01:11:49.972,No.
01:11:50.931,01:11:53.976,And you'll leave here and just find another faucet.
01:11:54.518,01:11:58.480,-You heard that? -I heard everything. This is my house.
01:12:00.316,01:12:01.150,Okay.
01:12:02.401,01:12:03.277,"Okay, yes."
01:12:04.653,01:12:07.698,"And tonight sucked, but we can start again."
01:12:12.369,01:12:13.495,"So, you have a plan?"
01:12:14.121,01:12:16.206,Yeah. We just say they attacked us.
01:12:17.541,01:12:18.375,I got him.
01:12:19.335,01:12:20.210,Whoo!
01:12:32.264,01:12:34.308,"Plus, dude, we would have so much fun."
01:12:35.642,01:12:37.478,Just you and me against the whole world.
01:12:38.020,01:12:39.938,No one will ever hurt you ever again.
01:12:40.022,01:12:43.275,There'll be nothing left to be afraid of. Isn't that what you wanted?
01:12:47.738,01:12:48.906,"What do you say, Cole?"
01:12:54.203,01:12:55.037,I guess...
01:13:00.209,01:13:01.794,"I guess I have a plan, too."
01:13:04.338,01:13:06.006,No!
01:13:06.423,01:13:07.549,No!
01:13:08.842,01:13:09.718,No!
01:13:29.947,01:13:32.408,"-When you're ready, you're ready. -A lot of things are scary."
01:13:34.743,01:13:35.953,You gotta figure out what you want...
01:13:37.788,01:13:40.958,-and then do what you can to get it. -Keys...
01:13:50.300,01:13:52.553,Ten. Two.
01:14:10.988,01:14:12.156,Yeah!
01:15:19.181,01:15:20.349,"What up, Cee?"
01:15:22.893,01:15:25.187,You drove a car into your house.
01:15:28.148,01:15:29.816,I really didn't see that coming.
01:15:37.866,01:15:39.076,You never told me...
01:15:40.911,01:15:42.913,your intergalactic dream team.
01:15:43.872,01:15:44.957,You didn't ask.
01:15:45.582,01:15:46.500,I should have.
01:15:47.543,01:15:49.586,I'm usually pretty good at that stuff.
01:15:55.175,01:15:56.843,Admiral Adama to lead.
01:15:59.680,01:16:02.307,Data for his intelligence and cool head.
01:16:05.561,01:16:06.603,Predator to fight.
01:16:10.399,01:16:11.275,Then me and you.
01:16:18.198,01:16:20.576,You didn't say we could add ourselves.
01:16:22.411,01:16:24.788,It's science fiction. You can do anything.
01:16:26.456,01:16:29.459,Well... I guess that's true.
01:16:33.297,01:16:34.673,But don't you get it yet?
01:16:39.886,01:16:41.388,I am the big bad.
01:16:45.392,01:16:46.476,I loved you.
01:16:54.693,01:16:59.489,I don't care about your dumb book or your stupid cult.
01:17:00.866,01:17:01.825,I'm an adult...
01:17:02.701,01:17:05.329,because when I realized you were the big bad...
01:17:06.413,01:17:12.961,"and you betrayed me and were just gonna hurt other kids, I drove a stolen car through you."
01:17:25.766,01:17:26.725,"I'll see you, Cee."
01:17:31.855,01:17:32.689,Goodbye.
