00:01:03.813,00:01:07.150,"We always thought it might, and then it just finally happened."
00:01:07.233,00:01:10.528,"But how it happened, now that's where it gets interesting."
00:01:11.321,00:01:12.781,Agatha 616.
00:01:12.864,00:01:15.283,"Yep, an asteroid heading straight for Earth."
00:01:15.366,00:01:16.701,I know. So obvious.
00:01:17.368,00:01:20.288,"So, humanity came together, and we did what we do best."
00:01:20.371,00:01:23.041,We shot a bunch of rockets at it! And we blew it up! And it was great!
00:01:24.042,00:01:28.713,"But it wasn't. You see, the thing that makes rockets rockets-- chemical compounds, a lot of 'em."
00:01:29.297,00:01:31.716,"Which rained back down on us, and everything changed."
00:01:32.467,00:01:35.011,"And by everything, I mean cold-blooded creatures."
00:01:35.095,00:01:38.640,"And by changed, I mean mutated and started eating us to death."
00:01:39.891,00:01:43.645,"Ants, lizards, roaches, crocodiles. You name it. There's a lot of 'em."
00:01:48.983,00:01:52.612,I knew this one kid who was eaten in his sleep by a goldfish he won at a carnival.
00:01:56.616,00:01:57.575,And that cat.
00:01:59.285,00:02:03.331,"So, for most of human history, if you wanted to kill a cockroach, all you needed was a shoe."
00:02:03.414,00:02:05.416,"Well, suddenly you needed a shotgun."
00:02:05.500,00:02:06.835,And sometimes even a tank.
00:02:07.836,00:02:09.754,And sometimes even that doesn't work.
00:02:09.838,00:02:13.007,"Especially if you don't stay in the tank, Bob."
00:02:14.843,00:02:17.929,"Eventually, the really big ones and our military took each other out."
00:02:19.597,00:02:23.268,We lost 95% of the human population in about a year.
00:02:24.144,00:02:25.395,That's a lot of Bobs.
00:02:26.104,00:02:27.272,And a lot of Todds.
00:02:28.481,00:02:35.488,"Those of us who survived, we hid anywhere we could-- bunkers, caves, panic rooms, all around the world."
00:02:36.156,00:02:39.826,So for the last seven years I've been living in an underground bunker.
00:02:40.535,00:02:42.912,It's not-- It's not as bad as it sounds. Really.
00:02:42.996,00:02:45.874,"It's a great group of people, and we all love each other."
00:02:46.708,00:02:49.460,It's kinda what I imagined college would have been like.
00:03:14.402,00:03:17.572,I've just gotten good at not really moving or breathing.
00:03:19.199,00:03:24.746,Being stuck in a survival bunker with a bunch of people who have all found their soul mate is less than ideal.
00:03:24.829,00:03:29.626,"Karen and Ray got together a few months ago, so they're still kinda in their honeymoon phase."
00:03:32.670,00:03:36.674,"Good for them, you know. They're both very attractive and apparently quite flexible."
00:03:36.758,00:03:39.302,"Hey, life's short. Especially down here."
00:03:52.607,00:03:55.318,Yeah. Probably not for the same reasons.
00:03:55.401,00:03:59.197,"You guys's, uh, door's open. Is that-- Did you know that?"
00:04:02.033,00:04:02.951,Okay.
00:04:05.203,00:04:06.746,he and Ava became inseparable.
00:04:06.829,00:04:07.705,Okay. Good night.
00:04:09.749,00:04:13.086,That's the asteroid they named 616 Agatha.
00:04:13.920,00:04:22.929,And these are all the chemical bombs they sent up to try and… Our first baby was born last winter. It was super emotional.
00:04:23.012,00:04:24.472,"Welcome to the apocalypse, kid."
00:04:24.555,00:04:26.975,The food sucks. At least you'll never know what you're missing.
00:04:27.058,00:04:29.894,Kala and Connor got together after Carol died.
00:04:30.687,00:04:33.606,Carol was a cow who ate a box of laundry detergent.
00:04:37.151,00:04:38.528,Her name's Gertie.
00:04:38.611,00:04:40.363,Gertie is great.
00:04:41.281,00:04:42.991,Gertie's not our only food source.
00:04:43.074,00:04:46.869,We have a hunting party that brings back whatever they can from the surface.
00:04:46.953,00:04:51.082,"It was easier in the beginning, you know, before we ran out of bullets."
00:04:51.165,00:04:56.087,Facing down one of those things with a janky handmade weapon is no walk in the park.
00:04:56.170,00:05:00.008,Or so they tell me. I-I don't go on the hunting parties.
00:05:00.091,00:05:05.680,They need me in the kitchen. I'm kinda the… Everyone likes my minestrone.
00:05:07.432,00:05:10.435,Being the only single person in the bunker has its perks too.
00:05:11.185,00:05:12.645,I get to hang out with Mavis.
00:05:13.521,00:05:16.274,"Of course, she's not much for conversation anymore."
00:05:16.357,00:05:19.736,"Her core battery's shot, just like every other Mavis, I'd imagine."
00:05:19.819,00:05:21.362,Actually never seen a working one.
00:05:37.462,00:05:39.547,I'd love for you to meet everyone.
00:05:41.132,00:05:43.801,Maybe we could do a little target practice together.
00:05:43.885,00:05:45.386,It's kinda my thing.
00:05:46.387,00:06:11.996,Well… Guys! I got the weapons.
00:06:13.081,00:06:14.290,-Stay. -What?
00:06:14.374,00:06:17.335,"-Get what you need, and let's go. -What's happening? What's going on?"
00:06:19.379,00:06:21.214,-Joel. -What do you mean?
00:06:21.297,00:06:24.008,"-Like inside-the-bunker breached? -That's what breached means, kiddo."
00:06:29.680,00:06:32.517,"Anna Lucia and I will engage. Anderson and Tim, flank us."
00:06:32.600,00:06:38.731,"Flank 'em, yeah, okay. Where do you guys need me? The rear, or-- -I thought we were past this, Joel. -Past what? You need help. I can help."
00:06:38.815,00:06:40.900,-Let me help. -You gonna make me say it?
00:06:40.983,00:06:43.486,"-Say what? -You can't handle it, Joel."
00:06:43.569,00:06:45.863,"-You're shook. -Okay, yeah."
00:06:50.785,00:06:53.329,"-We're not trying to make you feel bad. -We love you, Joel."
00:06:57.542,00:06:59.460,"Okay, why did that speech feel so rehearsed?"
00:07:03.172,00:07:05.800,"Okay, 30 meters out. Let's move."
00:07:13.558,00:07:15.560,"-Be careful, Connor-Bear. -I will, Kala-Bee."
00:07:28.906,00:07:30.658,Go with them.
00:07:54.807,00:07:55.892,They're coming back.
00:07:57.226,00:07:59.479,They need help. I'm going.
00:08:59.372,00:09:00.331,Connor.
00:10:02.852,00:10:04.854,"Did I shoot it, or did you?"
00:10:06.355,00:10:07.565,What do you think?
00:10:09.817,00:10:10.943,You.
00:10:17.825,00:10:19.493,But I am working on it.
00:10:35.426,00:10:37.178,-Does it look like me? -Yeah.
00:10:37.261,00:10:39.889,Are you sure that this pose looks natural?
00:10:40.723,00:10:42.224,-Yeah. -Yeah?
00:10:42.308,00:10:43.559,I think it's really good.
00:10:44.477,00:10:46.270,What are you doing? Don't move.
00:10:46.354,00:10:48.731,-Will you let me see it? -Don't-- Don't move. Aimee.
00:10:52.026,00:10:53.277,Okay.
00:10:54.862,00:10:55.863,Okay.
00:10:55.946,00:10:57.448,-Ready? -Mm-hmm.
00:11:09.502,00:11:11.420,"No, that's shading. I did the shading."
00:11:11.504,00:11:14.131,My head is-- is so large.
00:11:14.215,00:11:17.510,-You have a big head. -And my hand is so tiny.
00:11:17.593,00:11:18.969,You have tiny hands.
00:11:19.804,00:11:22.181,I love it. I frickin' love it.
00:11:25.726,00:11:27.645,-I got you something too. -What?
00:11:28.270,00:11:31.148,I don't know if these are the right ones.
00:11:31.732,00:11:34.985,No way. These are the ones that I-I-I wanted to get.
00:11:35.069,00:11:36.195,-Really? -Yeah.
00:11:38.781,00:11:40.991,Ooh. Hello.
00:11:41.075,00:11:45.871,"-What's happening right now? -Uh-- -Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm dancing with my shoulders."
00:11:45.955,00:11:47.748,"-Oh, yeah. -Oh, yeah."
00:12:03.472,00:12:05.558,This has been the best summer of my life.
00:12:06.559,00:12:07.810,Mine too.
00:12:12.606,00:12:13.566,Uh-oh.
00:12:14.316,00:12:15.693,What are you doing?
00:12:15.776,00:12:20.030,"-Do you know what time it is? -Uh, I think it's, like, 6:30."
00:12:20.114,00:12:23.200,"Aimee, you're-- you're scaring Crocodile Carl."
00:12:23.284,00:12:25.327,"Okay, look away, Crocodile Carl."
00:12:25.411,00:12:28.122,"Oh. Look away. Hey, I get it."
00:12:41.218,00:12:42.678,We need to go.
00:12:43.679,00:12:45.097,I'm scared.
00:13:04.283,00:13:07.286,We lost Connor to what looked like a really big ant.
00:13:10.414,00:13:12.416,Helps me to draw them.
00:13:12.500,00:13:16.754,"I try to capture their essence, scribble down some notes on how to kill them."
00:13:18.547,00:13:21.383,Sometimes I think it's the only way I know how to cope with these things.
00:13:37.274,00:13:39.610,"Hey, Janice. No, it's actually-- It's, uh, Joel."
00:13:43.489,00:13:45.324,All right. Hold on one second.
00:13:45.407,00:13:47.493,"Aimee, it's Ray!"
00:13:47.576,00:13:49.703,"It's Joel. Thanks, Janice."
00:13:54.375,00:13:56.752,"-How are you? -Hi. Yeah, I, uh-- I'm good."
00:13:56.836,00:13:59.964,-It's so good to hear your voice. -I'm so sorry.
00:14:00.047,00:14:03.217,I heard on the open frequency that one of you guys got killed.
00:14:03.300,00:14:05.427,Yeah. Breached the bunker.
00:14:05.511,00:14:07.972,Wow. Actually got inside?
00:14:08.055,00:14:11.809,Yeah. It's the first time it's happened. It was kinda scary.
00:14:11.892,00:14:13.727,Did you have to fight it too?
00:14:14.311,00:14:18.274,"Yeah. Yeah, a little. I had to fight it a little bit."
00:14:19.441,00:14:28.325,"Actually got super ripped since the last time you saw me, so-- Yeah, I was kidding. I'm not super ripped. That was just a bad joke."
00:14:29.034,00:14:30.786,"Well, I'm glad you're okay."
00:14:32.079,00:14:33.497,Thanks. Yeah.
00:14:34.707,00:14:38.043,I am still kinda blown away that you were even able to find my colony on this thing.
00:14:38.127,00:14:39.879,I know. It's pretty crazy.
00:14:39.962,00:14:42.756,'Cause I found it on the first one. What are the odds?
00:14:44.550,00:14:48.137,"Yeah. No, I-I called-- I called, like, 90."
00:14:50.097,00:14:53.183,"Hey, you know what I, uh-- know what I wish sometimes?"
00:14:53.267,00:14:54.476,What?
00:14:54.560,00:14:58.397,"That I could, like, s-snap my fingers and be back in that car with you."
00:15:01.066,00:15:02.693,"Man, that'd be nice."
00:15:02.776,00:15:08.032,"Yeah. Too bad it's, uh… you know, impossible."
00:15:08.782,00:15:11.911,Kinda feels like everything is impossible these days.
00:15:11.994,00:15:15.414,Taking care of this whole colony is exhausting.
00:15:17.207,00:15:19.460,"I, uh-- I-I write you letters."
00:15:20.878,00:15:22.046,Really?
00:15:23.756,00:15:26.383,"Yeah. Yeah, I-I write you letters sometimes."
00:15:26.467,00:15:28.552,-Aw! -All the time.
00:15:29.261,00:15:31.221,I'd love to read 'em.
00:15:56.956,00:15:59.833,You'd think you'd get numb to it after a certain point.
00:16:03.045,00:16:04.296,You don't.
00:16:10.844,00:16:13.389,"-I'm sorry. -Thank God! Where have you been, Joel?"
00:16:13.472,00:16:16.392,"We have to go right now. Say your goodbyes, get in the car."
00:16:16.475,00:16:18.185,-I should go. -Maybe you should come with us.
00:16:21.981,00:16:24.274,"Get in the car! Aimee, you need to hurry home now!"
00:16:24.358,00:16:26.735,-I want you to have this. -What? This is Crocodile Carl.
00:16:26.819,00:16:28.195,It's your good luck charm.
00:16:28.278,00:16:29.780,-Be careful. -You too.
00:16:39.832,00:16:40.666,Aimee.
00:16:42.710,00:16:43.961,I love you.
00:16:45.921,00:16:46.880,I love you too.
00:16:48.215,00:16:49.633,I'm gonna come find you.
00:16:50.843,00:16:52.136,You better.
00:17:11.989,00:17:14.616,-Nothing's getting in that way again. -But why did it happen?
00:17:14.700,00:17:17.536,It was a freak occurrence. There's no reason to think it'll happen again.
00:17:24.668,00:17:26.587,-What? -Aimee's colony.
00:17:27.463,00:17:30.215,-How far away is it? -About 85 miles.
00:17:30.299,00:17:33.761,-How long does that take to get there? -You're not actually thinking of going?
00:17:33.844,00:17:36.513,"Tim, just… humor me."
00:17:37.264,00:17:39.475,-How long? -Seven days.
00:17:40.184,00:17:41.185,Minimum.
00:17:41.268,00:17:45.147,An armed and trained hunting party would be lucky to last 50 miles on the surface.
00:17:45.230,00:17:52.196,"But you, Joel… All right, now I need volunteers to help reinforce some of the outer perimeter."
00:17:57.076,00:17:58.285,I'm gonna go.
00:18:01.371,00:18:03.791,"It's an impossible journey, Joel."
00:18:06.335,00:18:07.878,"No, I'm serious."
00:18:10.297,00:18:17.554,"I love you guys, but there's one person in this world who ever truly made me happy, and she's only 85 miles away."
00:18:17.638,00:18:19.014,And I'm gonna go see her.
00:18:21.600,00:18:22.726,Whew.
00:18:23.769,00:18:24.978,That felt awesome.
00:18:27.898,00:18:30.067,I'm done waiting for things to get better.
00:18:30.150,00:18:32.861,It's time to take matters into my own hands.
00:18:32.945,00:18:35.447,Time to let someone else make the minestrone.
00:18:36.949,00:18:39.618,"I'm taking a radio, even though it doesn't have power."
00:18:39.701,00:18:41.078,But I'm gonna take it anyway.
00:18:44.164,00:18:46.291,"Mavis, take care of her."
00:18:46.375,00:18:48.210,"You're not joking, are you?"
00:18:49.002,00:18:50.671,"Nope. Nope, I'm not."
00:18:51.964,00:18:53.006,He's not joking.
00:18:53.090,00:18:55.926,"We're not letting you leave, Joel. You're needed here."
00:18:56.009,00:18:58.929,"Tim, no, I'm not. Come on. I don't do anything."
00:18:59.012,00:19:02.850,"Joel, that's not true. You fix the radio. You make the minestrone."
00:19:06.687,00:19:08.605,Doesn't sound as important when I say it out loud.
00:19:08.689,00:19:10.566,"I appreciate you trying. Really, I do."
00:19:10.649,00:19:13.110,I just don't feel like I belong anywhere.
00:19:13.193,00:19:29.293,"I don't really wanna die all alone at the end of the world, so… Look, I know you guys all just think of me as, like, some little, pathetic, adorable hedgehog."
00:19:29.376,00:19:30.961,But I can take care of myself.
00:19:31.044,00:19:34.006,I'm actually probably a lot stronger than you might think.
00:19:36.175,00:19:38.886,"-We made you a map. -Thanks, Karen."
00:19:43.265,00:19:45.434,Just… take care.
00:19:45.517,00:19:47.477,Everything will try to kill you.
00:19:47.561,00:19:48.770,Oh.
00:19:48.854,00:19:51.190,Be observant. Use the advantages that you have.
00:19:51.273,00:19:53.609,"-You're fast and small, so… -Right."
00:19:53.692,00:19:55.110,-Don't fight. -Don't fight.
00:19:55.194,00:19:56.236,Just run and hide.
00:19:58.447,00:19:59.865,"Thanks, Ray."
00:20:01.283,00:20:03.160,You're an asshole if you get eaten.
00:20:11.335,00:20:13.754,-Okay. -Nice.
00:20:14.713,00:20:17.299,I love you guys. Tell Aimee I'll see her in seven days.
00:21:08.267,00:21:09.935,Where am I?
00:21:10.602,00:21:12.521,"Well, it's not super useful."
00:21:13.188,00:21:16.733,"Okay, well, you know what? We know we gotta head west. Right?"
00:21:17.859,00:21:20.654,"So, let's just… do that."
00:21:20.737,00:21:22.739,Start with something easy. West.
00:21:26.034,00:21:28.036,"Nope, it's this way. West is this way."
00:21:34.543,00:21:35.794,Shit.
00:21:36.378,00:21:38.714,Split the difference. Go this way.
00:21:39.631,00:21:41.633,Done. First decision made.
00:22:04.031,00:22:05.490,I'm really doing it!
00:22:05.574,00:22:08.994,"Honestly, I thought it'd be way worse. So far, it's not too bad."
00:22:09.077,00:22:12.539,"I've seen a lot of signs of death, but no actual death."
00:22:12.622,00:22:14.291,"So, cross your fingers."
00:22:16.001,00:22:17.002,Oh.
00:22:17.878,00:22:19.296,Monster eggs.
00:22:19.379,00:22:20.714,Trying to stay positive.
00:22:20.797,00:22:24.968,Weather's nice. Getting some fresh air. What else can I tell ya?
00:22:28.764,00:22:29.890,Cool.
00:22:39.775,00:22:42.986,Hide in the house. Hide in the house.
00:24:11.783,00:24:12.701,No.
00:24:13.827,00:24:16.121,"No, no, no. No!"
00:24:39.269,00:24:41.771,"Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!"
00:24:41.855,00:24:43.356,Where are you going?
00:24:54.201,00:24:55.952,Whoa!
00:24:56.036,00:24:57.662,"Whoa, that was so cool."
00:25:02.876,00:25:03.877,Nice place.
00:25:10.967,00:25:12.052,Thanks.
00:25:17.265,00:25:18.725,You all alone?
00:25:20.685,00:25:21.853,Me too.
00:25:30.403,00:25:33.406,Is that your name? Boy? Your name is Boy.
00:25:34.908,00:25:36.034,I'm Joel.
00:25:37.160,00:25:38.578,Nice to meet ya.
00:25:39.996,00:25:43.375,"Thanks, uh… Thanks for saving my life, Boy."
00:25:53.218,00:25:55.512,Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry.
00:25:56.096,00:25:58.098,"Okay, I won't touch it again."
00:26:00.475,00:26:01.560,Was that your owner's?
00:26:03.436,00:26:05.605,It's okay. You don't have to talk about it.
00:26:06.940,00:26:08.275,Sorry.
00:26:09.317,00:26:11.194,Wait. Did you think I was her?
00:26:12.571,00:26:13.488,Huh.
00:26:13.572,00:26:20.328,"I'm gonna lie down too. Is that o-- No, it's okay. Just my backpack."
00:26:30.630,00:26:33.008,"You know, I had a girl, too, once."
00:26:33.091,00:26:35.927,Think you would've really liked her. You guys would totally get along.
00:26:36.011,00:26:39.514,"She loves dogs. I mean, all animals. She's a big animal lover."
00:26:40.515,00:26:42.934,I haven't seen her in seven years.
00:26:43.018,00:26:45.854,Long time. That's why I'm trying to go find her.
00:26:47.272,00:26:50.567,"I haven't told anyone this, but I'm kinda nervous about it."
00:26:59.659,00:27:01.286,"Good night, Boy."
00:27:18.053,00:27:21.598,Weakness: dogs.
00:27:24.559,00:27:25.685,That's you.
00:27:27.020,00:27:29.981,"You wouldn't happen to have a power source to a ham radio in here, would you?"
00:27:30.065,00:27:33.151,'Cause I have a… Never mind.
00:27:41.910,00:27:44.162,Huh. Lipstick.
00:27:44.245,00:27:45.330,Aimee.
00:27:46.373,00:27:48.375,"Hey, would you mind if I kept this?"
00:27:48.458,00:27:49.459,Thanks.
00:27:50.168,00:27:52.962,"All right, well… this is it."
00:27:53.046,00:27:55.048,Thanks for having me.
00:27:55.131,00:27:58.718,I should… stop talking to a dog.
00:28:00.053,00:28:02.472,Okay. I'll see ya.
00:28:19.656,00:28:21.991,"Oh, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. None of that."
00:28:22.075,00:28:23.743,Something might hear you.
00:28:24.744,00:28:25.870,You wanna come with me?
00:28:27.414,00:28:29.249,Okay. You can come.
00:28:30.166,00:28:31.459,Let's go. Come on.
00:28:32.627,00:28:40.552,"Uh-- What-- Yeah, we can bring that. You want me to put it in my bag?"
00:28:43.096,00:28:46.015,Okay. It's okay. I'm gonna keep it safe. I promise.
00:28:47.767,00:28:49.769,Going in the safe backpack.
00:28:50.854,00:28:52.063,See?
00:28:52.147,00:28:53.565,"Okay, you ready?"
00:28:54.399,00:28:55.984,Let's go. Come on.
00:28:57.068,00:28:59.487,"Okay, that's really gonna have to stop."
00:29:02.365,00:29:04.659,"Feels good, actually, having company."
00:29:25.680,00:29:29.058,"I got a dog, and he's the coolest. His name is Boy."
00:29:29.142,00:29:32.270,He saved my life from a giant frog in a pool who tried to eat me with his tongue.
00:29:32.353,00:29:34.939,"And then we hung out on his bus. Man, do we make a great team."
00:29:36.983,00:29:40.737,We found out we have a ton in common too. I feel like we can talk about anything.
00:29:42.322,00:29:45.325,You gotta see us out here. We're like this iconic duo.
00:29:45.408,00:29:49.037,"I don't know. Feels like when we're together, we're unstoppable."
00:29:49.120,00:29:51.998,Hey. What are you doing? What you got in there?
00:29:55.293,00:29:57.378,We gotta go! Come on!
00:30:07.305,00:30:10.141,Sustenance. Perfect.
00:30:19.609,00:30:21.486,But they look so good.
00:30:25.198,00:30:27.951,"Yeah, you know what? I don't think I should eat these."
00:30:28.034,00:30:31.120,It's crazy the things you forget about the world. Like the smells.
00:30:31.204,00:30:33.331,"The grass, the trees, the flowers."
00:30:33.414,00:30:36.459,"Sure, you get the occasional bloody corpse, but… Aaah!"
00:31:02.902,00:31:04.362,climb out.
00:31:04.445,00:31:05.947,I can climb out.
00:31:18.293,00:31:19.502,This is bad.
00:32:15.224,00:32:17.310,"It's a rope, you numbskull!"
00:32:17.393,00:32:19.896,Put it around your foot and grab on!
00:32:41.417,00:32:43.044,"Minnow, finish 'em off."
00:32:44.462,00:32:58.601,"One, two, three, four and-- Was that a samurai sword?"
00:32:58.685,00:33:00.603,Why'd you fall into a Sandgobbler's nest?
00:33:00.687,00:33:03.690,"I didn't mean to, you know. I was just-- I was walking."
00:33:03.773,00:33:05.900,-What's your name? -Joel.
00:33:05.984,00:33:07.402,Joel Dawson.
00:33:07.485,00:33:09.362,"I'm, uh, Clyde. This is Minnow."
00:33:09.445,00:33:12.365,You're lucky we weren't monsters. You were yelling like a girl.
00:33:14.701,00:33:18.454,"Okay, I don't sound like that. My voice is not that high-pitched."
00:33:18.538,00:33:20.456,"-Yeah, it is. -Yes, it is."
00:33:20.540,00:33:22.834,"It was higher than mine, and I'm eight."
00:33:23.668,00:33:26.421,What in God's name are you doing up here alone anyway?
00:33:28.798,00:33:30.758,"Oh, wait, no! No, wait, wait!"
00:33:35.888,00:33:38.850,"-They almost killed my dog. -Hi, Boy!"
00:33:40.727,00:33:41.811,Hey.
00:33:42.562,00:33:45.481,"So, uh, what happened with your colony, man?"
00:33:45.565,00:33:46.983,They kick you out?
00:33:47.066,00:33:49.402,"No, I actually left on my own."
00:33:49.485,00:33:51.988,"-Something I had to do. -You stole food, didn't you?"
00:33:52.071,00:33:53.740,-He's a food stealer. -Yeah.
00:33:53.823,00:33:56.325,"No, I didn't steal any food."
00:33:56.409,00:33:57.452,Right.
00:33:57.535,00:34:00.079,Me and my colony were really close. Like family. Okay?
00:34:00.163,00:34:01.998,They were super upset that I left.
00:34:10.923,00:34:13.176,"What, uh-- What was that? What's going on?"
00:34:18.181,00:34:22.310,Limbsnapper. Limbcrusher. And my favorite-- the Chumbler.
00:34:29.484,00:34:32.737,"If it's got your scent, it's gonna be on you for a while."
00:34:32.820,00:34:36.032,"Hey, maybe I could, like, I don't know, come with you guys."
00:34:43.581,00:34:44.749,Going west.
00:34:45.333,00:34:47.335,To the coast. Jenner Beach.
00:34:48.044,00:34:50.463,Yeah. We're not cutting north just yet.
00:34:50.546,00:34:53.758,-Not cu-- Not cutting north just yet. -Come on. Come on.
00:34:53.841,00:34:55.551,Yeah. Whatever you want.
00:34:56.052,00:34:58.012,"You guys want me to come, I'll come."
00:34:58.096,00:34:59.263,Come on.
00:35:19.742,00:35:22.411,"That's a good, uh… little workout."
00:35:28.334,00:35:34.465,"You left a nice, safe colony to travel all the way to the ocean for a girl you ain't seen since you were, what, 17?"
00:35:34.549,00:35:37.802,"No, I know what you're thinking. I know how it sounds. It's crazy."
00:35:37.885,00:35:39.720,But… I don't know.
00:35:39.804,00:35:42.640,"If you knew our connection, you'd probably feel differently."
00:35:42.723,00:35:45.601,We actually just got back in touch over the radio a few weeks ago.
00:35:45.685,00:35:48.896,And it's still there. It's just magical. And so sweet.
00:35:48.980,00:35:52.108,"She loves me too, so a pick up right here we left off kind of thing."
00:35:52.191,00:35:55.486,-It's still there. -You ever hear the term fool's errand?
00:35:55.570,00:35:58.823,"All right, what, so I'm a fool because I believe in true love?"
00:35:58.906,00:36:15.089,"No, you're a fool because you're out here alone, you don't know a thing about survival… …you shoot for shit, yet you got an attitude like you're some kind of noble warrior floating on the wings of love."
00:36:15.173,00:36:17.717,-Doesn't work like that. -Okay.
00:36:18.426,00:36:20.720,Super encouraging speech.
00:36:28.269,00:36:29.770,-Damn it. -You're braining out.
00:36:29.854,00:36:32.857,-Huh? -Braining out. Thinking too much.
00:36:32.940,00:36:37.486,"I always clear my mind and say to myself, a needle through water."
00:36:37.570,00:36:39.280,A needle through water?
00:36:39.363,00:36:42.575,Trust me. My dad was the best archer in my colony.
00:36:42.658,00:36:46.787,"Oh, really? Okay. Then how come he's not the one giving me the lessons?"
00:36:46.871,00:36:48.331,'Cause I'm not her dad.
00:36:48.414,00:36:50.458,"Yeah, my dad got killed."
00:36:50.541,00:36:52.793,Back when we lived in the subway station.
00:36:52.877,00:36:54.378,Along with Elliot.
00:36:54.462,00:36:56.255,"Uh, wh-who's Elliot?"
00:36:56.339,00:36:57.465,My son.
00:36:58.716,00:37:01.385,"-Oh, I'm sorry. -No need to be sorry."
00:37:02.845,00:37:04.972,We all have stories like that. Don't we?
00:37:11.812,00:37:13.022,Needle through water.
00:37:20.529,00:37:22.615,"Hey, that was pretty close."
00:37:22.698,00:37:24.825,"-It was better. -It was really good, right?"
00:37:25.826,00:37:26.953,Right?
00:37:31.457,00:37:32.667,Yeah. Okay.
00:37:32.750,00:37:34.877,-First lesson. -Yeah. Hit me.
00:37:34.961,00:37:37.296,Always survey from high ground when possible.
00:37:38.839,00:37:40.341,Helps you spot the big ones in advance.
00:37:40.424,00:37:42.385,Nice to know that thing's not following us anymore.
00:37:42.468,00:37:45.596,"No, no, it's definitely still following us. Just saw it."
00:37:45.680,00:37:47.223,-What-- -Yeah.
00:37:47.306,00:37:49.016,-Chumbler. -I knew it.
00:37:50.017,00:37:53.062,-Big son of a bitch too. -Big sumanabitch.
00:37:55.189,00:37:58.359,-It's gonna be hard to shake. -Then why are we still standing here?
00:37:58.442,00:38:00.945,Relax. Chumblers aren't fast.
00:38:01.028,00:38:02.822,-We gotta keep moving. -Mmm.
00:38:02.905,00:38:04.573,Should've already been gone.
00:38:24.593,00:38:26.887,-To the mountains. -What's up there?
00:38:26.971,00:38:29.598,"A, uh, place called Snow Mountain Wilderness."
00:38:29.682,00:38:32.852,Supposed to be some kind of colony up there full of survivors.
00:38:32.935,00:38:35.730,The cold and elevation help to keep the monsters away.
00:38:35.813,00:38:38.065,You should definitely come with us.
00:38:38.149,00:38:41.861,"Well, I would, but, you know-- You gotta go find your girlfriend."
00:38:46.407,00:38:47.700,Minnow.
00:38:48.909,00:38:51.912,"If you knew her, you'd really like her. She's a super cool person."
00:38:51.996,00:38:56.584,"Well, she's not gonna like you, 'cause you can't even get out of a Sandgobbler's nest."
00:38:56.667,00:38:59.837,"And honestly, I just like you 'cause you have a really cute dog."
00:38:59.920,00:39:03.382,-Hurts my feelings. -You're so useless.
00:39:05.217,00:39:07.762,"It just means she likes you, man."
00:39:07.845,00:39:10.139,"She's, uh-- She's been through a lot."
00:39:12.183,00:39:13.225,Yeah.
00:39:13.309,00:39:15.311,So annoying.
00:39:16.520,00:39:18.397,-Joel. -What?
00:39:19.231,00:39:21.025,Don't move.
00:39:21.108,00:39:23.361,"-Oh, my God. Why? -Give me your shirt."
00:39:28.407,00:39:30.659,-Okay. -Get-- Hurr-- Come on.
00:39:30.743,00:39:33.579,"-Do what he says, Joel. -Give me your shirt."
00:39:35.498,00:39:37.166,Easy. Take it easy.
00:39:38.084,00:39:40.252,-That's it. That's it. -Is it a Chumbler?
00:39:42.880,00:39:45.508,"Take it easy. Lean over, man."
00:39:45.591,00:39:47.218,"-If I don't make it-- -Shh, shh."
00:39:53.516,00:39:56.435,Just stay very still.
00:40:04.735,00:40:08.030,"Shh, shh, shh, shh. Easy does it."
00:40:12.034,00:40:13.661,You're okay.
00:40:13.744,00:40:16.914,It's okay. You're all right.
00:40:17.957,00:40:20.126,"All right. Okay, now."
00:40:24.547,00:40:25.589,"Okay, now."
00:40:30.845,00:40:31.971,On your way.
00:40:34.181,00:40:36.308,Good boy. Good boy.
00:40:44.066,00:40:46.527,What you so scared for? Boulder Snails are nice.
00:40:47.319,00:40:48.696,There can be nice ones?
00:40:48.779,00:40:52.241,You can always tell in their eyes. Just look at their eyes.
00:40:55.411,00:40:58.539,Gonna spread your scent all over this hillside.
00:40:58.622,00:41:02.376,Shoot. That old Chumbler ain't gonna know which way to go.
00:41:14.138,00:41:19.101,But they'll crush your ass… in a second.
00:41:27.234,00:41:31.155,Just a little project I started a while back in my colony.
00:41:31.822,00:41:36.202,"Every time we encountered a new monster, I'd just make a little entry."
00:41:37.745,00:41:40.789,"A drawing. Um, just some info about it."
00:41:40.873,00:41:43.250,"You know, strengths, weaknesses. Stuff like that."
00:41:43.334,00:41:45.753,"Made me feel like I was helping out, you know."
00:41:49.048,00:41:51.800,-I seen this one. Ugly bastard. -Yeah.
00:41:51.884,00:41:53.677,"-Doesn't like loud noises. -Oh, yeah."
00:41:53.761,00:41:56.722,Also doesn't like shotgun blasts to the head.
00:41:56.805,00:41:58.432,Might wanna add that.
00:41:59.016,00:42:01.227,Shotgun to the face.
00:42:02.770,00:42:04.688,"-Do you mind if I… -Oh, sure."
00:42:04.772,00:42:06.732,"Yeah. Oh, thanks. Thanks."
00:42:09.818,00:42:12.029,I was 16 when it hit.
00:42:12.112,00:42:14.532,"Yeah, they sent everything up at once to take her down."
00:42:15.157,00:42:20.704,They had the balls to call us the lucky ones just 'cause whatever the hell was in those things didn't affect us.
00:42:21.288,00:42:25.209,Ain't nothing lucky about getting kicked off the top of the food chain.
00:42:25.292,00:42:30.881,"Yeah, my parents thought if we could… just make it out of Fairfield, we might have a shot."
00:42:30.965,00:42:32.383,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:42:33.926,00:42:35.844,You're from Fairfield?
00:42:35.928,00:42:37.763,Yeah. Why?
00:42:39.598,00:42:42.893,"Man, I've never met anyone who made it out of Fairfield."
00:42:42.977,00:42:45.980,That place was basically ground zero.
00:42:46.063,00:42:49.316,"Shit, I've only heard horror stories."
00:42:51.068,00:42:52.695,"Yeah, it was pretty bad."
00:42:52.778,00:42:56.615,"Your parents, uh… Oh, uh, no."
00:43:02.329,00:43:03.956,Couldn't save 'em.
00:43:04.832,00:43:06.625,You putting that on yourself?
00:43:07.251,00:43:08.252,Mmm.
00:43:14.675,00:43:16.885,You're more of a survivor than I thought.
00:43:20.639,00:43:23.225,That's the coolest thing anyone's ever said to me.
00:43:24.143,00:43:25.769,It's a good start.
00:43:25.853,00:43:30.274,Keep it up. Book like this could save someone's life out here.
00:43:31.817,00:43:32.943,"Thanks, Clyde."
00:43:37.114,00:43:38.657,sure your girl's worth it?
00:43:39.491,00:43:40.993,Coming all this way?
00:43:43.829,00:43:45.039,Yeah.
00:43:45.664,00:43:46.665,"Yeah, she is."
00:43:53.297,00:43:54.882,You don't have to.
00:43:56.133,00:43:57.885,Not even at the end of the world.
00:44:15.569,00:44:17.029,Lesson two.
00:44:17.112,00:44:20.199,You get a hot meal or a good night's sleep.
00:44:20.282,00:44:22.576,-Not both. -Not both.
00:44:22.660,00:44:24.078,Are you being serious?
00:44:24.161,00:44:27.164,Something will have smelled our food and be all over this camp within the hour.
00:44:27.247,00:44:31.085,"Why wouldn't you tell me that, though? Uh, I didn't-- I didn't do either."
00:44:31.168,00:44:33.754,"I can't tell you everything, man. Keep up."
00:44:44.765,00:44:48.977,"Roar! I'm gonna kill you, Joel Dawson! I'm gonna eat you like broccoli!"
00:44:51.230,00:44:56.485,"I'm Joel, and I can't protect my girlfriend because I'm useless and insecure and an awkward little teenager."
00:44:56.568,00:44:58.821,But I need you to save me! I thought you loved me.
00:45:02.491,00:45:04.618,-What? -That's your girlfriend dying.
00:45:04.702,00:45:06.704,-What? -A needle through water.
00:45:07.788,00:45:10.416,A needle through water. Needle through water.
00:45:12.418,00:45:15.713,Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! See? Bull's-eye!
00:45:18.507,00:45:20.300,"Got yourself an admirer there, huh?"
00:45:20.384,00:45:22.344,"Hey, we gotta get going."
00:45:22.428,00:45:24.179,"Uh, okay."
00:45:24.263,00:45:29.685,Come on. Come on. We gotta go. We-- Minnow? What are you doing?
00:45:33.522,00:45:35.023,Human friends.
00:45:35.107,00:45:36.859,And they're teaching me everything they know.
00:45:38.068,00:45:40.988,Like lesson three: Don't take shortcuts.
00:45:43.866,00:45:46.201,Lesson eight: Target practice every day.
00:45:47.202,00:45:48.746,Getting pretty good with my crossbow.
00:45:51.749,00:45:54.418,Lesson ten: Keep your socks dry. That's a great one.
00:45:55.794,00:45:59.923,I'm kinda struggling with lesson two: Not both. That one is not great.
00:46:05.804,00:46:07.389,I'm super tired.
00:46:16.273,00:46:23.238,"All right, a lot of things out here you shouldn't touch or eat, but, uh, ferns like these have an antivenom."
00:46:23.322,00:46:25.949,"Good in a pinch for snakes, slugs."
00:46:30.204,00:46:33.207,The insect-looking ones got no peripheral vision.
00:46:33.290,00:46:34.291,No peripheral-- Ah!
00:46:34.374,00:46:37.419,The lizard-looking ones can't climb for shit.
00:46:37.503,00:46:41.006,"The amphibian-looking ones like to hide, lure ya in, eat ya whole."
00:46:43.342,00:46:44.968,Those guys are badasses.
00:46:45.052,00:46:47.012,Badasses!
00:46:47.095,00:46:48.972,"Yeah, I know. I fell into their hole."
00:46:49.056,00:46:50.933,What you saw were worker bees.
00:46:51.016,00:46:54.561,What you wanna avoid under all circumstances is a queen.
00:46:54.645,00:46:55.938,How do I know if it's a queen?
00:46:56.021,00:47:03.779,"Well, your first clue would be a giant fin slicing through the earth, following every single sound and vibration you make."
00:47:05.906,00:47:08.992,…as you're being ripped in half will be your second.
00:47:15.499,00:47:18.710,"You're gonna wanna go west to Jenner, the beaches."
00:47:19.253,00:47:22.548,"Or you can be sensible, come with us to the mountains."
00:47:23.632,00:47:29.054,"Yeah, um, I think I've been sensible all my life, it's really gotten me nowhere."
00:47:29.137,00:47:31.348,"Come with us. Strength in numbers, you know?"
00:47:32.349,00:47:34.518,"Besides, think we'd make a good team."
00:47:34.601,00:47:38.856,"No, I think so, too. I just, uh-- It's just something I gotta do."
00:47:38.939,00:47:40.399,It's not fair.
00:47:41.066,00:47:47.281,"Wh-- Hey. Wha-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. What's going on?"
00:47:51.159,00:47:54.454,"'Cause this girl, she means a lot to me. You know?"
00:47:54.538,00:47:57.791,Come on. You know I gotta do this. We talked about this.
00:47:59.501,00:48:02.212,"Hey, you know what? I got something for ya."
00:48:02.296,00:48:05.924,"I don't even know if you'd know what this is, but-- Lipstick?"
00:48:06.008,00:48:07.134,Oh.
00:48:11.388,00:48:12.723,Aw.
00:48:14.683,00:48:16.977,I take back what I said before.
00:48:17.060,00:48:18.562,Aimee's gonna love you.
00:48:20.314,00:48:22.524,"Thanks, Minnow. You got some snot."
00:48:26.194,00:48:28.113,All right. Come on.
00:48:37.664,00:48:40.959,Listen to your instincts out here. They'll keep you alive.
00:48:41.043,00:48:44.463,"Yeah. What if I have, uh, terrible instincts?"
00:48:44.546,00:48:45.547,You'll die.
00:48:46.256,00:48:51.845,"Y-- Listen, man, good instincts are earned by making mistakes."
00:48:52.888,00:48:57.351,"If you're lucky enough to survive a few mistakes, you're gonna be okay out here."
00:48:59.436,00:49:01.188,"This might come in handy, too."
00:49:01.271,00:49:02.481,Wow!
00:49:03.565,00:49:06.568,"Oh, that's great. Do you have, uh-- Do you have any more that I could have?"
00:49:06.652,00:49:07.903,You get one.
00:49:07.986,00:49:11.615,"Pull the pin, count to five. Not four, not six."
00:49:12.157,00:49:13.075,Five.
00:49:18.747,00:49:19.831,You're gonna be okay.
00:49:21.667,00:49:22.709,Minnow?
00:49:22.793,00:49:24.044,"Let's go, kid."
00:49:27.547,00:49:30.550,"Hey, man, you made it all this way from Fairfield."
00:49:31.718,00:49:33.887,"What's another 30 miles, huh?"
00:49:50.195,00:49:51.405,Hey there.
00:50:04.626,00:50:06.837,"I know. I'm gonna miss 'em, too."
00:50:06.920,00:50:09.339,"It's a good decision, though. It's good."
00:50:09.423,00:50:11.008,"You feel good about it, right?"
00:50:14.594,00:50:15.846,"Come on, Boy."
00:50:51.631,00:50:56.344,"Aw, I'm okay. I'm just gonna-- You can have that."
00:50:57.512,00:50:59.431,I'll just stick to the beans.
00:51:00.849,00:51:22.329,"I'm not gonna eat that, so… Hey, come on. We gotta keep moving."
00:51:22.412,00:51:25.540,I know. There's a lot of creepy stuff. Creepy boats.
00:51:27.167,00:51:28.960,Kind of a creepy sign.
00:51:29.044,00:51:31.963,But nothing we haven't seen before.
00:51:32.047,00:51:33.465,Just gotta be brave.
00:51:36.968,00:51:39.596,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? What's happening?"
00:51:43.600,00:51:45.769,"Boy, Boy, Boy! Boy!"
00:51:47.896,00:51:50.607,Hey! Boy! Boy! Boy!
00:51:53.026,00:51:54.945,I need some kind of communication here.
00:51:57.155,00:51:59.908,Oh. I hear it.
00:52:10.961,00:52:12.587,We gotta go. Hey.
00:52:12.671,00:52:16.049,We really gotta go. Please get out from under the duck.
00:53:28.371,00:53:29.581,You okay?
00:53:30.665,00:53:32.334,Joel! Get out of the car!
00:53:33.043,00:53:34.502,"Joel, get outta the car!"
00:53:38.089,00:53:39.799,"Run, Joel, run!"
00:53:39.883,00:53:41.760,Run! Go!
00:53:48.516,00:53:49.351,I love you.
00:54:12.874,00:54:14.251,No.
00:54:18.255,00:54:19.381,Hey!
00:54:43.697,00:54:44.739,Are you okay?
00:54:48.118,00:54:49.911,"Yeah! Yeah, you're okay! You're okay!"
00:54:49.995,00:54:53.373,You're okay. You're okay. You're okay.
00:54:53.456,00:54:55.083,Aren't you? Aren't you?
00:54:55.166,00:54:56.876,Ah!
00:54:56.960,00:54:58.169,Yeah!
00:54:59.671,00:55:01.381,We're monster killers.
00:55:17.022,00:55:18.148,Wow.
00:55:18.898,00:55:21.443,"You know, I haven't felt the rain in seven years."
00:55:21.526,00:55:23.903,Pretty cool. Pretty cool.
00:55:28.700,00:55:30.702,"Hey, Boy, you think I'm crazy?"
00:55:32.412,00:55:34.080,Coming all this way?
00:55:56.686,00:55:58.313,Holy shit.
00:56:00.774,00:56:02.525,You're alive.
00:56:02.609,00:56:05.528,I mean… you're on.
00:56:05.612,00:56:10.784,I have 51 minutes of power left. What is your name?
00:56:10.867,00:56:13.328,"Uh, I'm Joel."
00:56:14.204,00:56:16.873,"-My name is Joel. -Hello, Joel."
00:56:16.956,00:56:19.334,I am so pleased to meet you.
00:56:19.417,00:56:21.211,My name is Mavis.
00:56:21.294,00:56:26.132,"But if you were to write it out, you would write it with a 1 and not an I."
00:56:26.216,00:56:28.093,"Yeah, I know."
00:56:28.176,00:56:32.138,You are familiar with the Mav1s line. Delightful!
00:56:32.222,00:56:34.557,You guys were supposed to be the next amazing thing.
00:56:34.641,00:56:36.351,I can't believe I'm talkin' to one.
00:56:36.434,00:56:41.398,"But if you were to write it out, you would write it with a 1 and not an I."
00:56:42.857,00:56:44.776,Yeah. You said that.
00:56:45.485,00:56:51.574,"Years ago, I was bitten in half by something I did not get a chance to name."
00:56:51.658,00:56:57.705,"I crawled here for safety and powered down, hoping someone would one day find me."
00:57:00.083,00:57:01.084,Amazing.
00:57:01.167,00:57:09.467,"Joel, besides conversing with me, for which I am eternally grateful, may I ask what you are doing outside of your colony?"
00:57:09.551,00:57:13.263,"Yeah, um-- Did you steal food?"
00:57:13.346,00:57:14.180,No.
00:57:14.806,00:57:16.558,"No, I didn't steal any food."
00:57:16.641,00:57:20.895,"Um, I'm actually on a quest… to find a girl."
00:57:20.979,00:57:25.066,"Why, Joel, a lovely lady has caught your eye!"
00:57:25.150,00:57:26.401,What is her name?
00:57:26.484,00:57:30.363,"Uh, her name's Aimee. With one I and two E's."
00:57:30.447,00:57:34.200,"She sounds like an incredible person, Joel."
00:57:35.743,00:57:42.500,Is there anything I can do to assist you in your quest for Aimee with one I and two E's?
00:57:42.584,00:57:47.338,"Nope. Appreciate it, Mav1s, but, uh, unfortunately not."
00:57:47.422,00:57:50.925,Unless you happen to have a power source to an SK-21 ham radio handy.
00:57:52.844,00:58:02.103,"Oh, no, but-- I would be honored to donate my remaining power to you if it would help you with your quest for Aimee with one I and two E's."
00:58:07.859,00:58:10.153,She probably thinks I've been devoured by now.
00:58:10.236,00:58:12.530,"Oh, this is all so exciting!"
00:58:15.200,00:58:17.202,-It's working. -Hooray!
00:58:18.411,00:58:20.997,"3022? Come in, 3022."
00:58:23.500,00:58:26.127,Your colony told me you were coming here. Are you okay?
00:58:26.211,00:58:28.630,I was worried. It's so good to hear your voice.
00:58:28.713,00:58:32.091,"Yeah, it's good to hear yours, too. Yeah, I'm alive. I'm good. I'm okay."
00:58:32.175,00:58:35.094,I-I-I can't believe you're actually doing this.
00:58:35.178,00:58:38.056,"I know. It's crazy. Aimee, I cannot wait to tell you everything."
00:58:38.139,00:58:39.974,"I feel like a whole new man, you know?"
00:58:40.058,00:58:42.519,You should see me out here. I'm fighting monsters.
00:58:42.602,00:58:44.771,I'm in a motel right now with a robot and a dog.
00:58:44.854,00:58:47.190,What? That sounds crazy.
00:58:47.273,00:58:49.526,How far are you from Jenner Beach?
00:58:49.609,00:58:55.532,"Um, how far? I'm getting close. I'm, um… I'm 9.3 miles to you."
00:58:55.615,00:58:58.618,"Joel, listen. I have amazing news."
00:58:58.701,00:59:01.788,"Some survivors showed up a few days ago, and they're rescuing us."
00:59:01.871,00:59:03.373,They're gonna get us out of here!
00:59:03.456,00:59:06.042,They're really helping me with the colony.
00:59:06.125,00:59:08.753,"Oh. Okay, g-getting you out of there? What do you mean?"
00:59:08.836,00:59:14.342,I can't remember the last time I actually felt like everything was going to be-- Wh-- Aimee?
00:59:14.425,00:59:15.885,Aimee? Aimee?
00:59:15.969,00:59:17.136,Shit.
00:59:17.220,00:59:24.811,My battery has automatically shut down in order to preserve my final 15 minutes of power.
00:59:24.894,00:59:27.814,"-I am very sorry, Joel. -No, it's okay, Mav1s."
00:59:32.193,00:59:33.278,Joel?
00:59:33.945,00:59:37.907,I haven't been outside in a very long time.
00:59:37.991,00:59:39.993,"Yeah. I hadn't, either."
00:59:46.374,00:59:49.294,"-There you go. -Is something troubling you, Joel?"
00:59:49.961,00:59:54.215,"You can tell me anything, as I am an empathetic listener."
00:59:54.299,00:59:59.887,"Also, my memory banks will be permanently erased in 14 minutes."
01:00:02.348,01:00:06.144,You know that feeling where you just completely put yourself out there?
01:00:06.227,01:00:08.062,You know? And you're so sure of it.
01:00:08.146,01:00:16.821,"And… right when you're about to cross the finish line, you just think is this the dumbest… thing I ever could've done?"
01:00:16.904,01:00:19.532,"I don't think it's dumb, Joel."
01:00:19.616,01:00:21.951,I think it's romantic.
01:00:22.035,01:00:24.203,"Right, see? Yeah, okay, you get it."
01:00:25.455,01:00:27.332,"Romantic, that's what-- Yeah."
01:00:28.082,01:00:30.710,"Do not give up on your quest, Joel."
01:00:30.793,01:00:40.845,"When you see her, she will appreciate the grand romantic gesture implied by your journey and be moved by your kindness and leadership qualities."
01:00:40.928,01:00:41.888,"Thanks, Mav1s."
01:00:43.723,01:00:53.358,Another option is that Aimee will not see those qualities in you and you will have traveled a great distance only to be met with disappointment.
01:00:53.441,01:00:57.278,Perhaps you will have learned valuable lessons along the way?
01:00:58.112,01:00:59.364,Okay.
01:00:59.447,01:01:09.999,"A third option is that you don't survive the journey at all and get eaten by mutated insects… -Okay, that's-- I get it. -…amphibians-- There are so many ways you could perish."
01:01:10.083,01:01:11.125,I get it.
01:01:11.209,01:01:15.129,Thanks for the… Thanks for that.
01:01:17.215,01:01:19.592,"Would you like to see a trick, Joel?"
01:01:19.676,01:01:21.260,Sure.
01:01:21.344,01:01:24.555,"What is your full name, and where were you born?"
01:01:24.639,01:01:26.808,"Uh, Joel Dawson. Fairfield, California."
01:01:30.061,01:01:31.312,Whoa.
01:01:33.022,01:01:34.023,Whoa.
01:01:34.107,01:01:36.859,"What lovely parents you had, Joel."
01:01:40.530,01:01:41.531,Wow.
01:01:42.490,01:01:44.617,I don't even have a picture.
01:01:44.701,01:01:49.872,"What would you say to your mother now, Joel, if you had the chance?"
01:01:56.462,01:01:58.214,I guess I'd tell her I'm okay.
01:02:03.177,01:02:05.179,I made it to a colony.
01:02:06.431,01:02:11.394,"Met a lot of really, really good people who took really good care of me."
01:02:19.819,01:02:33.249,"They also lost a lot, so… I'm so sorry."
01:02:44.343,01:02:47.597,"Oh, look! Sky Jellies!"
01:02:47.680,01:02:51.100,They're harmless and quite lovely.
01:02:52.393,01:02:53.561,Wow.
01:02:54.854,01:02:57.732,Oh! Canis familiaris!
01:02:57.815,01:03:01.235,You found my foot. Thank you.
01:03:01.319,01:03:04.363,-That's my dog. -He's delightful.
01:03:43.945,01:03:46.906,"You know, nature's kinda nice when there's nothing trying to kill you."
01:03:54.330,01:03:55.456,Mav1s?
01:04:01.087,01:04:02.380,Thanks.
01:04:12.181,01:04:15.101,"That's not something I gotta worry about, you don't think, right?"
01:04:15.184,01:04:22.108,"I mean, what are the odds that they're, like, awesome and similar to my age and potentially a threat to me romantically?"
01:04:22.191,01:04:24.402,"Slim to none, probably."
01:04:24.485,01:04:27.655,"I think it's good, actually. I think we're totally, uh… fine."
01:04:27.738,01:04:36.205,"Actually, why don't we pick up the pace a little bit, just in case-- Um… Okay, you know what?"
01:04:36.289,01:04:37.999,Why don't we go another way. Yeah?
01:04:39.584,01:04:45.214,Uh… Boy?
01:04:45.298,01:04:46.299,Boy!
01:04:48.134,01:04:50.052,"Boy, where you going?"
01:05:01.439,01:05:03.024,Queen.
01:05:32.345,01:05:33.930,"Run, Boy! Run!"
01:05:45.441,01:05:54.200,Sh… Boy!
01:06:36.867,01:06:38.494,Shh-shh-shh. Shh.
01:06:41.872,01:06:44.917,"Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh."
01:07:14.321,01:07:17.408,"Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so sorry."
01:07:18.034,01:07:19.160,I'm sorry.
01:07:26.751,01:07:28.335,Don't you dare.
01:07:33.507,01:07:35.009,"No. Wait, Boy!"
01:07:35.092,01:07:36.218,Boy!
01:07:39.889,01:07:41.515,Don't. Don't you do it.
01:07:55.988,01:07:57.615,Count to five.
01:07:59.075,01:08:01.452,"One, two-- Shit!"
01:08:04.830,01:08:08.167,"Two. Uh, three, four… five!"
01:08:27.770,01:08:29.021,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
01:08:29.897,01:08:31.023,Yes!
01:08:31.690,01:08:33.818,"Yes! Oh, my God!"
01:08:34.860,01:08:36.946,"Oh, that was awesome."
01:08:58.467,01:09:00.094,"Oh, my God."
01:09:01.053,01:09:02.096,Ow! Ow!
01:09:05.057,01:09:07.184,Get that dress out of my face!
01:09:09.436,01:09:10.437,Boy?
01:09:20.865,01:09:22.324,Oh!
01:09:28.289,01:09:43.053,"Oh, f… Okay."
01:09:43.137,01:09:44.597,"Oh, no."
01:10:03.199,01:10:05.492,"Okay, all right, I think I'm good."
01:10:05.576,01:10:07.161,I think I got 'em all.
01:10:08.370,01:10:09.538,What?
01:10:21.550,01:10:24.386,This is all your fault! What is wrong with you?
01:10:24.470,01:10:27.097,"Why don't you listen to me, huh? Huh?"
01:10:27.181,01:10:29.475,You have any idea what you just did? You almost got us killed!
01:10:29.558,01:10:32.228,"We are supposed to care about each other, okay?"
01:10:32.311,01:10:36.023,"I would never do that to you, never! You bailed on me! Oh, my God!"
01:10:36.106,01:10:38.984,That freakin' dress! I can't take it anymore!
01:11:00.839,01:11:02.925,"And by it, I don't remember what I was talking about."
01:11:04.593,01:11:06.887,I can't feel my feet.
01:11:06.971,01:11:08.472,Or my face.
01:11:10.182,01:11:11.475,I think I'm dying.
01:12:04.278,01:12:05.571,that's Boy.
01:12:06.739,01:12:08.615,"Please, look after him."
01:12:09.408,01:12:10.993,Tell him I'm sorry.
01:12:13.412,01:12:15.998,Have you seen him? I yelled at him.
01:12:16.081,01:12:18.417,Don't take his dress out of his mouth. He doesn't like that.
01:12:18.500,01:12:20.419,And now I might not ever see him again.
01:12:20.502,01:12:23.297,And please don't shout at him. I know you won't.
01:12:25.924,01:12:27.092,Joel.
01:12:28.469,01:12:29.762,"Oh, my God."
01:12:30.471,01:12:32.931,-It's you. -Aimee?
01:12:33.015,01:12:34.683,I can't believe you made it.
01:12:35.601,01:12:37.603,"Oh, my God. I can't believe you made it."
01:12:38.395,01:12:40.022,"You made it, Joel."
01:12:40.814,01:12:43.359,"-Are you okay? -Yeah, yeah."
01:12:45.736,01:12:47.571,"Oh, you're so beautiful."
01:13:02.836,01:13:04.254,That was nice.
01:13:18.477,01:13:19.478,Aimee?
01:13:21.814,01:13:22.815,Aimee.
01:13:22.898,01:13:24.608,"-Aimee. -Hey, hey, hey, hey."
01:13:24.691,01:13:26.360,T-T-Take it easy. Take it easy.
01:13:26.443,01:13:29.405,Still pretty messed up from all the poison. How do you feel?
01:13:30.572,01:13:32.116,I feel-- I'm good.
01:13:32.199,01:13:34.368,"Good. No, I'm f-- I-I'm okay."
01:13:35.494,01:13:38.705,"What was it like? I mean, you have to tell me everything."
01:13:38.789,01:13:41.750,"Honestly, it wasn't that bad. I don't know what everyone's complaining about."
01:13:41.834,01:13:44.336,"-Oh? -No, it was terrible."
01:13:44.420,01:13:46.380,I almost… died a lot.
01:13:47.798,01:13:49.716,It's so good to see you.
01:13:50.801,01:13:52.636,I'm lucky you found me when you did.
01:13:52.719,01:13:56.432,"About that, um… And hey, we… kissed."
01:13:56.515,01:13:59.435,"-You were hallucinating pretty hard. -How amazing was that, huh?"
01:13:59.518,01:14:00.727,You kissed Old Pete.
01:14:01.937,01:14:04.148,"-Hi, Pete. -Oh. Yeah."
01:14:06.442,01:14:07.860,That'd be hilarious.
01:14:10.696,01:14:12.030,"Oh, yeah, I really did."
01:14:15.451,01:14:17.744,I don't know how to move on from this.
01:14:17.828,01:14:23.584,"What was that you said on the radio about, uh-- Yeah. This yacht captain and his crew show up out of the blue."
01:14:23.667,01:14:26.253,"-Did you say a yacht captain? -Yeah, yeah."
01:14:26.336,01:14:29.548,And he says he can find us a safe place to live and a new home.
01:14:29.631,01:14:31.258,I'm trying to pack everything up right now.
01:14:31.341,01:14:33.051,Why is he called a yacht captain?
01:14:33.135,01:14:35.053,"'Cause he's the captain of the yacht, you moron."
01:14:35.137,01:14:37.431,"Oh, my God. Be nice, Bill."
01:14:37.514,01:14:38.974,-What? -I'm trying to listen.
01:14:39.641,01:14:43.562,"So anyway, I just wanted to say something to you, though-- -Whoo. -Oh!"
01:14:43.645,01:14:47.524,Aimee! Aimee! We got another leak in the main line.
01:14:47.608,01:14:50.152,Bastard's spitting freshwater all over the beach!
01:14:50.235,01:14:53.030,"Yeah, yeah, thank you, Janice. I'll be right there."
01:14:53.113,01:14:54.698,"-Oh. -Hi, Joel."
01:14:54.781,01:14:56.783,"Hey, Janice. Good to meet you."
01:14:56.867,01:14:58.410,-Please-- -Everyone's so old.
01:15:01.079,01:15:03.165,-Can we put a pin in this? -Yeah.
01:15:22.893,01:15:24.144,"Hey, man."
01:15:43.497,01:15:46.792,I don't know what's happening here. What can we do?
01:15:50.128,01:15:52.714,"Janice, will you just-- Will you give me the wrench?"
01:15:55.926,01:15:59.221,Who left the kelp out in the sun? That was meant to be packed up already.
01:16:01.598,01:16:04.851,"Yeah, I don't think feet are meant to be that color."
01:16:06.853,01:16:07.813,Hey.
01:16:07.896,01:16:09.273,Perfect timing.
01:16:09.356,01:16:12.359,"Guys! Joel, this is Dana and Rocko."
01:16:12.442,01:16:14.903,-What's up? -These are the guys from the yacht.
01:16:14.987,01:16:16.446,Cool. Oh.
01:16:16.530,01:16:18.865,Is that a-- Is that an arm cannon?
01:16:19.491,01:16:20.492,Homemade.
01:16:20.576,01:16:23.203,So which one-- Which one of you is the yacht captain?
01:16:23.287,01:16:25.872,Guilty as charged. Captain Brooks Wilkinson.
01:16:25.956,01:16:28.125,"-Royal Australian Navy. -Oh, dear God."
01:16:28.208,01:16:32.045,"Retired, of course. My mates call me Cap. How you doing, man?"
01:16:32.129,01:16:35.757,"I see you've met these specimens, but this beautiful lady, that's our yacht."
01:16:36.925,01:16:39.720,"A little showy for my taste, but she gets the job done."
01:16:39.803,01:16:41.805,"-Huh. -Cap, this is Joel."
01:16:41.888,01:16:42.889,Joel. Right.
01:16:42.973,01:16:45.976,Joel ended up traveling seven days on the surface to get here.
01:16:46.059,01:16:48.228,"-Seven days? -Seven-- Yeah, seven days."
01:16:48.312,01:16:51.148,"-That is one hell of a journey, Joel. -It was. Yeah."
01:16:51.231,01:16:53.317,"I don't get it. Why'd you leave your colony, Joel?"
01:16:53.400,01:16:54.651,You get caught stealing food?
01:16:54.735,01:16:58.363,"No, I didn't get caught stealing food. Why is that such a thing?"
01:16:58.447,01:16:59.781,He came for love.
01:17:00.574,01:17:02.034,"Good on ya, mate. That's beautiful."
01:17:02.117,01:17:04.911,There is no mission more admirable than love.
01:17:04.995,01:17:07.456,Every sailor worth his salt knows that.
01:17:07.539,01:17:09.583,"Yo, Cap. We cooking this shit or what?"
01:17:09.666,01:17:11.835,"Feel like I got King Kong's nuts on my shoulders, man."
01:17:11.918,01:17:14.212,"That's charming, Rock, really."
01:17:14.296,01:17:17.424,"Joel, you look like a man who knows his way around a barbecue."
01:17:17.507,01:17:20.177,-I… don't-- -Come help us get a fire started.
01:17:20.260,01:17:25.891,"Um, actually, I'm gonna… -catch up with Aimee for a sec, if it's… -Yeah."
01:17:28.477,01:17:31.855,You show up and… here I am trying to give you orders.
01:17:31.938,01:17:33.440,"I'll give you guys some privacy, yeah?"
01:17:33.523,01:17:35.400,"-Thank you. -Yeah, namaste."
01:17:35.484,01:17:38.528,"Uh, I was gonna just, if you-- -Hey, Joel. -Yeah?"
01:17:38.612,01:17:44.409,"We're throwing a killer going-away party tonight. Nothing fancy, but… we'll have a drink together to welcome you to the colony."
01:17:44.493,01:17:45.494,Okay.
01:17:45.577,01:17:46.912,First beer's on me.
01:17:46.995,01:17:48.330,Thanks.
01:17:48.413,01:17:49.414,He's nice.
01:17:50.248,01:17:51.708,Brews his own beer.
01:17:54.086,01:17:55.796,Course he does.
01:17:59.174,01:18:01.468,I'm sorry. There's just so much going on right now.
01:18:01.551,01:18:02.886,-Do you mind? -Yeah.
01:18:02.969,01:18:04.096,It's crazy.
01:18:04.179,01:18:06.348,"Pretty nice here, you know."
01:18:06.431,01:18:08.725,"Why, uh… why do you have to leave?"
01:18:08.809,01:18:11.269,-It's beautiful. It's just not safe. -Right.
01:18:11.353,01:18:13.146,Everyone's afraid.
01:18:13.230,01:18:16.358,Even your bunker got breached and you're all young and strong.
01:18:16.441,01:18:17.776,Yeah.
01:18:17.859,01:18:18.860,"Hey, Aimee?"
01:18:19.945,01:18:31.832,"Sorry. I know you got, like, a lot going on, but, uh… you know, I came-- I came all the way here to see you, and so I'm just… checkin' in."
01:18:31.915,01:18:34.751,Just wondering how you're… feeling about that.
01:18:35.585,01:18:37.963,I think it's the most romantic thing anyone's ever done.
01:18:38.046,01:18:48.598,"You do? Okay. Okay, good, 'cause, um-- But listen, Joel, um… talking to you on the radio was such a nice escape from the stress of running this colony."
01:18:48.682,01:18:49.683,Yeah.
01:18:50.392,01:18:56.064,"And, um… I mean, you're probably the only person left alive from my old life."
01:18:56.773,01:18:58.442,From Fairfield.
01:19:01.778,01:19:06.658,"Oh. There's a… there's a but coming, isn't there?"
01:19:08.368,01:19:10.829,"But I didn't think you'd actually come here, Joel."
01:19:12.456,01:19:16.251,Oh. Um… And I am so happy to see you.
01:19:16.334,01:19:21.298,"I'm just not-- I'm not the same person that I used to be, you know?"
01:19:21.381,01:19:23.759,"Seven years, that's a long time."
01:19:23.842,01:19:33.185,"I've-- I've lost people. My mom, my friends, and-- Last year I lost someone… and he meant a lot to me."
01:19:34.686,01:19:37.773,Um… Whew.
01:19:57.459,01:20:00.462,"Oh, man, I feel like such an idiot."
01:20:00.545,01:20:05.842,"-No. No, don't. -I didn't even-- I didn't even ask you if I should come."
01:20:05.926,01:20:08.386,"I just got so excited, and I-- I left."
01:20:09.095,01:20:10.931,I don't know what I thought.
01:20:12.516,01:20:14.601,"Well, I know what I thought."
01:20:14.684,01:20:20.524,"I'd come and… and sweep you off your feet, and we'd be happy."
01:20:20.607,01:20:22.067,"Oh, Joel."
01:20:22.150,01:20:27.364,But you… didn't w-want… me.
01:20:27.447,01:20:41.586,"I am so sorry. I should have said something on the radio or-- No. It's okay. It's okay. Um… I know this isn't how you pictured this going, but… you'll still come with us, right?"
01:20:42.212,01:20:45.298,"Come with you-- Uh, on the… yacht?"
01:20:47.801,01:20:49.803,This is our shot at survival.
01:20:52.264,01:20:53.682,Give Cap a chance.
01:21:04.901,01:21:07.153,HMS Brisbane. First watch.
01:21:07.237,01:21:09.322,I was the first person to see it coming over the wall.
01:21:12.784,01:21:14.244,I sounded the alarm.
01:21:15.287,01:21:16.538,Too late.
01:21:19.624,01:21:21.918,Those of us that survived took to the sea.
01:21:22.002,01:21:26.339,"I mean, make no mistake. We have lost this war. Right?"
01:21:26.423,01:21:29.259,There is no place for mankind on land. But out there?
01:21:29.968,01:21:31.094,There we got a chance.
01:21:34.472,01:21:37.392,Sorry. Just got a… question.
01:21:37.475,01:21:44.149,"I survived seven days on the surface, and… if I can do that, literally anyone can."
01:21:44.232,01:21:47.277,Seven days on the surface? I'm impressed.
01:21:47.360,01:21:56.786,"So maybe we still have a chance… to fight and-- and, you know, win, uh… win our-- win our world back."
01:21:56.870,01:22:01.041,"I have a plan. And if you have a better one, mate, I'm-- I'm all ears."
01:22:01.124,01:22:19.935,"-And I will stand by your side. -You wanna hear my-- just, uh… Hey, that's on me."
01:22:20.018,01:22:28.860,"I-I didn't mean to put you on the spot, mate. It's-- And you're great on the radio."
01:22:28.944,01:22:31.196,Lord knows I need a comms expert.
01:22:35.909,01:22:39.412,Do you guys have a radio I can use? I want to contact my colony.
01:22:40.580,01:22:43.917,"7045, this is 3022. Come in."
01:22:46.378,01:22:49.839,"7045, this is 3022. Is anyone there?"
01:22:49.923,01:22:51.841,Tim? Ava? Anyone. Over.
01:22:51.925,01:22:53.677,Cap thought you might need a snack.
01:22:54.678,01:22:56.846,"-Oh. -You know, he brews his own beer."
01:22:58.098,01:23:00.517,"-Yep. Yeah, I heard. -It's good, man."
01:23:00.600,01:23:02.560,-Cool. Thank you. -Yeah.
01:23:58.783,01:24:00.285,Hey. Yeah! Yeah!
01:24:00.368,01:24:02.328,"Yeah, Ray, is that you? It's me. It's Joel."
01:24:09.002,01:24:11.421,It's me. It's Joel. I'm-- I'm-- I'm safe.
01:24:11.504,01:24:13.673,I-I made it. I'm at Aimee's colony.
01:24:27.270,01:24:30.315,"It's-- I don't know, but I blew it up. I blew it up with a hand grenade!"
01:24:32.650,01:24:38.031,"Yeah, it was so awesome, and-- What else? What else? Uh, I met these two really cool survivors."
01:24:38.114,01:24:44.120,"And they taught me all these things. They live on the surface and-- And, oh, oh, oh! I met a Mav1s."
01:24:47.749,01:25:04.682,"Uh, she was… very informative, emotionally, and… And I got a dog too, um… Uh, really… really good."
01:25:12.565,01:25:14.567,"Man, I really miss you guys."
01:25:16.194,01:25:20.198,"How is, uh-- How is everything back there? Give me the update."
01:25:23.243,01:25:25.537,Multiple breaches? What do you mean? Is everyone okay?
01:25:25.620,01:25:28.456,Not really. I don't think we can stay here much longer.
01:25:31.000,01:25:32.544,"Uh, guys?"
01:25:34.003,01:25:37.757,"Surviving for now. What? Sur-- Ray? Hey, guys!"
01:25:44.013,01:25:45.306,Guys?
01:25:55.942,01:25:57.527,I gotta go back.
01:25:58.778,01:26:00.363,What am I doing here?
01:26:14.544,01:26:15.753,Purple berries.
01:26:31.519,01:26:33.146,Lying son of a bitch.
01:26:34.731,01:26:36.232,Son of a bitch!
01:26:48.494,01:26:50.205,"Y'all like this shit, huh?"
01:26:51.164,01:26:52.165,Aimee.
01:26:54.959,01:26:56.669,"-Joel! -Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey."
01:26:59.881,01:27:00.882,"Oh, you're so drunk."
01:27:00.965,01:27:06.554,"Hot, super ripped, super awesome Joely-Joely Dawson!"
01:27:08.431,01:27:11.726,This is super important. I need to talk to you about something.
01:27:11.809,01:27:14.103,You have to get everyone out of here right now.
01:27:14.187,01:27:17.023,"Okay, I think something bad is about to happen. I'm telling you."
01:27:17.106,01:27:19.692,I can feel it. This is a bad-- This is a bad vibe.
01:27:22.987,01:27:25.740,I think he's planning something. I don't think he's here to save you.
01:27:25.823,01:27:28.243,-Who? -The yacht captain. He tried to poison me.
01:27:28.326,01:27:31.329,Cap. Cap's right there. He's dancing.
01:27:32.747,01:27:36.125,"Oh, my-- I hate him. I hate him so much."
01:27:36.209,01:27:38.670,"Listen, he gave me these poison berries, okay?"
01:27:38.753,01:27:41.005,I know that the berries are poison because my dog told me.
01:27:41.089,01:27:42.757,You have a talking dog?
01:27:42.840,01:27:44.801,"-No, no, no, Aimee. -I love dogs!"
01:27:51.766,01:27:53.476,Please. Please try to listen to me.
01:27:53.559,01:27:55.645,I need your help. Something's gonna happen.
01:27:55.728,01:27:57.772,"Your colony, they're in danger."
01:27:57.855,01:27:58.815,-Joel. -What?
01:28:09.951,01:28:12.287,"Oh, shit."
01:28:12.370,01:28:14.580,"-Aimee? Aimee? -Joel? Joel, are you okay?"
01:28:16.124,01:28:18.209,"Joel, I'm sorry about the fist to your face."
01:28:18.293,01:28:21.504,I couldn't have you talking shit about us on the radio. I didn't wanna mess this up.
01:28:25.717,01:28:28.136,"Dana, d-don't. Not the radio tower!"
01:28:34.017,01:28:37.395,"So, you probably figured out we're not on a pleasure cruise."
01:28:37.478,01:28:40.481,My crew and I want to thank you for your generous donations.
01:28:40.565,01:28:42.900,"Food, water, supplies, medicine."
01:28:42.984,01:28:44.944,We greatly appreciate it.
01:28:45.028,01:28:48.239,It will see us through to the next helpless colony down the coast.
01:28:51.743,01:28:55.121,But it's not that simple. The world is basically devoid of fossil fuels.
01:28:55.204,01:28:57.290,"Not enough to run a yacht on, anyway."
01:28:57.373,01:29:00.626,"So my crew and I, we had to improvise just to survive."
01:29:00.710,01:29:04.088,"And we found a real special fuel source. Actually, Rocko did."
01:29:04.172,01:29:06.424,"-Didn't ya, big fella? -Yeah, that was me."
01:29:06.507,01:29:10.345,"Ten tons of pure power, chained to the front of that yacht."
01:29:11.179,01:29:12.513,She's sleeping now.
01:29:14.349,01:29:15.933,She will be hungry soon.
01:29:23.775,01:29:25.276,What?
01:29:25.360,01:29:26.986,"Well, what can I say?"
01:29:28.988,01:29:30.698,Shit gets crazy in the apocalypse.
01:29:31.282,01:29:32.700,"Oh, my God."
01:29:58.059,01:29:59.060,Run!
01:30:19.080,01:30:27.463,M'kay. Just gotta find a way to free my hands from the-- I have to stop these bastards from taking our stuff!
01:30:30.383,01:30:34.137,You traveled 85 miles across hell. I think I can stop three assholes.
01:30:34.220,01:30:35.304,-You get the crab! -What?
01:30:37.515,01:30:39.058,This is desperate.
01:32:41.389,01:32:43.349,Boy? Boy!
01:32:51.524,01:32:53.442,Dana? Shoot the dog.
01:33:17.133,01:33:29.270,Rocko? Time to go. Let's mo-- Boy! I need you to listen to me right now.
01:33:29.353,01:33:32.231,You see over there? Go get Aimee.
01:33:32.315,01:33:33.816,Let's move it!
01:33:33.899,01:33:35.067,Go now. Now. Now!
01:33:35.651,01:33:37.278,I'm sorry I yelled at you!
01:33:44.118,01:33:45.119,Move.
01:33:51.876,01:33:57.923,"Okay, crab, you want some of-- Whoa!"
01:34:05.306,01:34:07.808,Okay! Whoa! Whoa!
01:34:07.892,01:34:10.603,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen. You don't wanna do this."
01:34:30.665,01:34:32.416,-Joel! -Aimee!
01:34:32.500,01:34:35.336,"Aimee! Aimee, throw me the cannon! I know how to kill it!"
01:34:55.690,01:34:58.109,You can always tell in the eyes.
01:34:58.192,01:35:01.404,-What are you doing? Shoot it! -Shoot it! What are you waiting for?
01:35:05.783,01:35:06.867,Needle through water.
01:35:10.454,01:35:11.914,Cap?
01:35:54.039,01:35:55.458,"Oh, my God."
01:36:03.507,01:36:06.260,"Oh, shit, we're gonna die. We're dying."
01:36:36.999,01:36:38.334,That was amazing.
01:36:38.417,01:36:41.378,What? Uh-- Amazing? Me?
01:36:42.004,01:36:53.098,"-Yeah. -You thought I was… -Thank you, Joel. -Yeah?"
01:36:53.182,01:36:56.811,"Yeah, well, I would've done it different, but… you did all right."
01:36:56.894,01:36:58.771,Oh. Okay.
01:36:58.854,01:37:03.400,"Sorry. Yeah, just… That's looking better. Take care of it."
01:37:12.451,01:37:17.706,"-Hey. -Hey. Um… I gotta get back to my colony, see if they're okay."
01:37:17.790,01:37:20.000,"Right, yeah. Yeah."
01:37:20.084,01:37:25.130,"Some friends of mine told me that there's a place in the mountains, I guess, that's safe from the monsters."
01:37:25.214,01:37:27.633,So maybe we'll all head there.
01:37:27.716,01:37:28.926,Oh.
01:37:29.009,01:37:41.605,"Um, it was really cool to just-- to see you in action, and… I don't know, how you take care of all these people, and then… -Oh. -I'm so glad you came."
01:37:45.860,01:37:46.986,I gotta go.
01:37:47.069,01:37:48.821,I'm worried about 'em.
01:37:48.904,01:37:49.947,Yeah.
01:37:51.490,01:37:58.122,But I had something for you. Um… Crocodile Carl?
01:38:00.958,01:38:03.043,Thought you should have him back finally.
01:38:04.545,01:38:09.592,"Here, uh… -No, I can't take that. You need it. -No, no, no."
01:38:09.675,01:38:12.469,I want you to take it. It'd mean a lot to me.
01:38:12.553,01:38:19.226,"Really, take it. Um… I got it all up here, anyway. So I can always make copies."
01:38:19.310,01:38:24.231,Thanks for inspiring me to… take this trip.
01:38:25.357,01:38:27.026,It's the best decision I ever made.
01:38:28.527,01:38:31.864,"All right, uh, I'm gonna go."
01:38:31.947,01:38:33.407,"-Yeah. -Boy, come on!"
01:38:34.158,01:38:38.579,"Um… -Uh, be careful. -Yeah, you, too."
01:38:40.456,01:38:41.916,"-Bye, Aimee. -Bye."
01:39:05.230,01:39:08.776,That was… -Great. -Yeah.
01:39:16.158,01:39:17.701,I'll come find you.
01:39:20.162,01:39:21.455,You better.
01:39:26.168,01:39:27.127,Okay.
01:39:39.139,01:39:43.227,"I'm 24 years old, and I survived seven days on the surface."
01:39:51.485,01:39:52.778,"Twice, actually."
01:40:04.748,01:40:06.125,-Joel? -Joel?
01:40:08.669,01:40:10.838,"-Oh, my God! -Hey, hey, hey!"
01:40:24.226,01:40:30.482,I'm alive because of the generosity of a few strangers and the kindness of a great dog.
01:40:32.443,01:40:34.278,My colony and I are headed to the mountains.
01:40:35.154,01:40:37.156,There's supposed to be less monsters there.
01:40:38.073,01:40:42.619,And don't get me wrong. The surface is a dangerous place.
01:40:43.495,01:40:46.540,But I don't think hiding underground is the answer anymore.
01:40:46.623,01:40:50.836,"There is a great big, beautiful, inspiring world out there."
01:40:55.591,01:40:57.885,"If I can survive out here, anybody can."
01:40:58.469,01:41:00.345,It's like a good friend once told me.
01:41:00.429,01:41:03.223,Good instincts are earned by making mistakes.
01:41:03.307,01:41:07.686,"If you're lucky enough to survive a few mistakes, you're gonna do all right out here."
01:41:07.770,01:41:11.523,"In this recording, you'll find everything I know about our new world."
01:41:11.607,01:41:13.525,Most of this I had to learn the hard way.
01:41:13.609,01:41:15.944,"Hopefully, it'll make your way a little easier."
01:41:16.487,01:41:19.323,"So, crank open that hatch."
01:41:19.406,01:41:20.866,"Okay, come on."
01:41:25.788,01:41:28.832,"It won't be easy, but it'll be worth it."
01:41:30.751,01:41:37.466,I traveled 85 miles to find that what I'd been missing below ground for seven years was right above my head this whole time.
01:41:37.549,01:41:39.176,And it's incredible.
01:41:40.469,01:41:43.555,"Oh, and one last thing. Don't settle."
01:41:43.639,01:41:47.309,You don't have to. Not even at the end of the world.
01:41:55.442,01:41:58.779,"Signing off, Joel Dawson."
01:42:30.394,01:42:33.188,"It's a long journey, kid. I hope you know what you're doing."
