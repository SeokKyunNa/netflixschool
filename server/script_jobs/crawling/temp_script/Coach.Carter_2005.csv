00:03:56.862,00:04:00.824,"You got two points in 16 minutes, -that's why coach got rid of your dumb ass."
00:04:00.866,00:04:03.744,"Timo, you was in the game the whole time, you never even touched the rock."
00:04:03.785,00:04:04.828,You didn't do shit.
00:04:04.870,00:04:06.205,Who was you passing the ball to?
00:04:06.246,00:04:07.539,You were playing and didn't do shit!

00:04:23.138,00:04:26.349,"I have to tell you, sir, I haven't made up my mind yet."
00:04:27.935,00:04:30.979,"As I've told you, it's time for me to step down."

00:04:40.655,00:04:45.493,"I can't get them to show up for school, for practice."
00:04:45.535,00:04:47.121,-I can't get parents involved.
00:04:47.162,00:04:50.498,And I'm done chasing kids in the streets and pulling 'em into the gym.
00:04:50.540,00:04:52.167,"Yeah, it's a tough job."
00:04:52.209,00:04:53.835,Richmond is a tough little city.
00:04:54.878,00:04:58.173,"When I saw you here tonight, I thought, I got him. He's in."
00:04:58.215,00:05:01.260,"Well, actually, I was here for another reason."
00:05:01.301,00:05:04.138,My son plays for St. Francis.
00:05:04.179,00:05:05.346,He does?

00:05:07.515,00:05:10.018,"Well, you didn't see him."
00:05:10.060,00:05:11.145,He didn't play.
00:05:11.186,00:05:12.479,That's great. Great school.
00:05:13.605,00:05:15.023,"What, you wanna go?"
00:05:15.065,00:05:16.733,-Hey! Hey!
00:05:17.442,00:05:18.610,Hey!
00:05:18.652,00:05:19.903,"Lyle, bring it!"
00:05:21.571,00:05:23.406,You think everybody's scared of you?
00:05:23.448,00:05:24.658,"Cruz, chill, man."
00:05:24.699,00:05:26.868,"Why you gotta be trying to act all hard all the time, man?"
00:05:27.744,00:05:29.163,"God, I'm sick of you, man!"
00:05:32.499,00:05:34.960,that school was rough when I went there.
00:05:35.002,00:05:36.544,It's way beyond that now.
00:05:36.586,00:05:38.964,"Hm. Well, then, just forget about it."
00:05:39.006,00:05:40.715,Don't even discuss it again.
00:05:40.757,00:05:42.884,I can't quite do that.
00:05:42.926,00:05:46.305,Coach officially offered me the job tonight.
00:05:46.345,00:05:49.348,"And when you say offering job, there's usually money involved."
00:05:49.390,00:05:52.519,Yeah. There might be a thousand bucks in it for me.
00:05:52.560,00:05:54.729,For five months of work?
00:05:54.771,00:05:57.565,"Oh, well, you can't say no to that."
00:05:57.607,00:06:00.443,"And the team, it's so bad."
00:06:00.485,00:06:03.197,"Those boys, they're so angry and undisciplined."
00:06:03.238,00:06:05.573,"And besides, you know, you don't have the time."
00:06:05.615,00:06:07.326,You're trying to open up a second store.
00:06:07.366,00:06:09.953,Exactly. I don't have the...
00:06:09.995,00:06:11.872,And you promised to take your girlfriend to Mexico in January.
00:06:11.913,00:06:13.623,And I'm definitely keeping that promise.
00:06:13.665,00:06:19.213,There's no way I'm not going to Mexico and hanging out on the beach with you in your bikini.
00:06:19.254,00:06:20.630,I can't take that job.
00:06:21.756,00:06:23.091,So when do you start?
00:06:28.222,00:06:29.639,You should've spoken to me first.
00:06:29.681,00:06:32.142,It was a personal choice for me.
00:06:32.184,00:06:33.601,"So, what happens to me?"
00:06:33.643,00:06:35.354,You still gonna come to my games?
00:06:35.394,00:06:38.523,"most of your games, Damien."
00:06:38.565,00:06:40.108,Then I'll go to Richmond and play for you.
00:06:40.150,00:06:41.484,No.
00:06:41.526,00:06:42.736,"Well, why not?"
00:06:43.987,00:06:45.906,"Dad, you've always been my coach."
00:06:45.947,00:06:48.616,"This is a great school, Damien."
00:06:48.658,00:06:50.535,It puts you in a great position for college.
00:06:50.577,00:06:52.037,"Dad, I'm a freshman!"
00:06:52.079,00:06:56.250,"Just because I'm coaching at Richmond, it doesn't change our plans for your future, all right?"
00:07:22.525,00:07:24.236,"I need a vial, man."
00:07:24.278,00:07:25.987,You got that good dope?
00:07:40.835,00:07:42.503,"your ID, didn't you?"
00:07:42.545,00:07:43.838,-I forgot it.

00:08:01.398,00:08:03.024,"You too, ma'am."
00:08:03.066,00:08:07.237,"If the offer still stands, I'd like to coach the team."
00:08:09.114,00:08:11.032,"Well, I hope you're up for the task."
00:08:11.074,00:08:13.076,These young men need discipline.
00:08:13.118,00:08:17.164,"The job comes with a $1,500 stipend and a major time commitment for the next four months."
00:08:19.499,00:08:21.001,I accept.
00:08:21.042,00:08:23.462,Great. We're thrilled to have you.
00:08:23.503,00:08:27.132,"Gentlemen, I hate to be abrupt, but I do have a budget meeting I need to run to."
00:08:27.174,00:08:29.468,"Mr. Carter, is there anything you need from us?"
00:08:29.509,00:08:33.721,"Well, I just need about, um, 25 copies of this document."
00:08:35.307,00:08:36.475,I'm all set.
00:08:36.516,00:08:39.019,"Ray, would you see to it that Mr. Carter..."
00:08:39.060,00:08:40.103,Coach Carter gets these copies?
00:08:40.145,00:08:42.397,-Will do.
00:08:45.484,00:08:50.780,"I'm not saying this is not gonna be a challenge, but, Kenny, you know the deal here."
00:08:50.822,00:08:53.200,"Just keep in mind, these are good boys."
00:08:53.700,00:08:55.702,Guys! Guys!

00:09:06.004,00:09:09.508,This is Ken Carter.
00:09:09.549,00:09:12.135,He was a two-sport all-American.
00:09:12.177,00:09:15.596,"Still holds records for scoring, assists, steals."
00:09:15.638,00:09:19.100,Basketball scholarship to George Mason University.
00:09:19.142,00:09:21.478,We're lucky to have Coach Carter.
00:09:21.520,00:09:24.064,"Now, let's give him the respect he's due."
00:09:24.898,00:09:26.024,"They're all yours, coach."
00:09:26.066,00:09:27.234,"Thank you, sir."
00:09:30.695,00:09:32.572,"Good afternoon, young men."
00:09:32.613,00:09:36.826,"As Coach White said, I'm your new basketball coach, Ken Carter."
00:09:38.328,00:09:40.455,I guess I need to speak louder so you can hear me.
00:09:40.497,00:09:42.957,"I'm Ken Carter, your new basketball coach."
00:09:42.999,00:09:46.503,"Oh, we hear you, dog."
00:09:46.545,00:09:49.548,"The glare from your big, black-ass head is hella shiny, man."
00:09:49.589,00:09:50.673,"Damn, do you buff it?"
00:09:50.715,00:09:53.676,"Oh, you got jokes to go along with that ugly jump shot of yours, huh?"
00:09:57.597,00:10:02.643,"if you need to know my credentials, as Coach White said, they're on the wall there behind you."
00:10:02.685,00:10:08.858,"Secondly, if basketball practice starts at 3:00, you are late as of 2:55."
00:10:10.318,00:10:11.736,"You, shooting the ball."
00:10:12.529,00:10:14.030,"What's your name, sir?"
00:10:14.072,00:10:16.408,Jason Lyle.
00:10:17.325,00:10:18.618,You're not a sir.
00:10:19.494,00:10:20.787,"Well, are you a madam?"
00:10:21.996,00:10:23.415,Bitch.
00:10:23.457,00:10:26.334,"As of now, you are a sir."
00:10:26.376,00:10:28.169,So are the rest of you.
00:10:28.211,00:10:31.047,Sir is a term of respect.
00:10:31.089,00:10:35.009,And you will have my respect until you abuse it.
00:10:35.051,00:10:38.972,"Mr. Lyle, how many games did you guys win last season?"
00:10:40.348,00:10:42.267,"Like four wins, 22 losses."
00:10:43.017,00:10:44.894,-Sir.
00:10:47.688,00:10:49.649,I'm going to give you contracts.
00:10:51.818,00:10:58.074,"If you sign and honor your side of them, we are going to be successful."
00:10:58.116,00:11:00.868,"Damn, do I get a signing bonus for signing this contract?"
00:11:00.910,00:11:05.582,"Yes, sir."
00:11:05.624,00:11:09.294,"Because if there's one thing I know, it is this."
00:11:09.336,00:11:11.421,The losing stops now.
00:11:12.713,00:11:20.721,"Starting today, you will play like winners, act like winners, and most importantly, you will be winners."
00:11:20.763,00:11:24.683,"If you listen and learn, you will win basketball games."
00:11:24.725,00:11:29.814,"And, gentlemen, winning in here is the key to winning out there."
00:11:30.857,00:11:35.487,This contract states that you will maintain a 2.3 grade point average.
00:11:35.529,00:11:40.450,You will attend all your classes and you will sit in the front row of those classes.
00:11:40.492,00:11:42.452,"Yo, this a country-ass nigga, dog."
00:11:42.494,00:11:44.454,Excuse me.
00:11:44.496,00:11:49.376,"Worm was wondering, are you some country church nigga, with your tie on and all that?"
00:11:49.417,00:11:51.044,"That's what you wanna say, right?"
00:11:51.085,00:11:52.711,"And what is your name, sir?"
00:11:52.753,00:11:54.881,"I'm Timo Cruz, sir."
00:11:54.922,00:12:03.097,"Well, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Worm, what you should both know is we treat ourselves with respect."
00:12:03.973,00:12:05.517,We don't use the word nigga.
00:12:05.559,00:12:07.768,Are you some preacher man or some shit?
00:12:07.810,00:12:09.896,'Cause God ain't gonna do you no good in this neighborhood.
00:12:09.937,00:12:11.565,"I live in this neighborhood, sir."
00:12:11.606,00:12:14.359,"Sir. Can you believe this uppity nigga, sir?"
00:12:17.070,00:12:18.446,"Okay, Mr. Cruz."
00:12:19.322,00:12:20.448,Leave the gym right now.
00:12:20.990,00:12:22.325,For what?
00:12:22.367,00:12:28.081,I'll ask you one last time to leave the gym before I help you leave.
00:12:28.122,00:12:30.291,-Before you what?
00:12:31.543,00:12:32.711,Do you even know who I am?
00:12:33.503,00:12:36.881,"From what I can see, a very confused and scared young man."
00:12:36.923,00:12:38.132,Scared of who? Scared of you?
00:12:38.174,00:12:40.427,I'm supposed to be scared of you?
00:12:40.468,00:12:41.720,"Nigga, I ain't scared of nobody."
00:12:41.760,00:12:43.471,I will lay your ass out.
00:12:43.513,00:12:44.556,I don't think so.
00:12:50.853,00:12:52.063,A'ight.
00:12:57.944,00:12:59.404,What you doing?
00:13:03.366,00:13:05.493,Teachers ain't supposed to touch students.
00:13:05.535,00:13:06.994,I'm not a teacher.
00:13:07.912,00:13:09.623,I'm the new basketball coach.
00:13:19.132,00:13:20.258,This ain't over!
00:13:34.897,00:13:37.942,Is there anybody else who's not feeling this contract?
00:13:39.527,00:13:41.279,"Come on, man, where you going?"
00:13:44.282,00:13:46.451,I don't do high school contracts.
00:13:46.493,00:13:48.202,You tell us when you need the real ballers.
00:13:48.244,00:13:50.246,"I will do that, sir."
00:13:50.288,00:13:53.082,"There goes our two leading scorers from last season, man."
00:13:53.124,00:13:56.336,"Then I guess we'll have new leading scorers this season, huh?"
00:13:58.421,00:14:03.718,"Now, I cannot teach you the game of basketball until your conditioning is at a level that allows me to do so."
00:14:04.761,00:14:07.263,"Gentlemen, report to the baseline."
00:14:10.933,00:14:12.101,To the baseline!
00:14:19.818,00:14:22.570,I presume you all know what suicides are.
00:14:22.612,00:14:23.697,So...
00:14:32.038,00:14:34.957,I saw the St. Francis game the other night.
00:14:34.999,00:14:37.794,None of you have a problem shooting the ball.
00:14:37.836,00:14:41.005,You all had a problem getting up and down the court.
00:14:42.674,00:14:45.677,"If you are late, you will run."
00:14:45.719,00:14:49.848,"If you give me attitude, you will do pushups."
00:14:49.889,00:14:52.266,So you can pushup or shut up.
00:14:53.100,00:14:54.894,That's up to you.
00:14:54.935,00:14:56.855,"-Yo, how many we gonna do?"
00:14:58.481,00:15:00.900,"Yo, sir, how many we gonna do?"
00:15:00.941,00:15:05.988,Let's see how many you can do in one hour and seven minutes.
00:15:07.407,00:15:10.117,"Uh, fellas, don't make me commit homicide."
00:15:10.159,00:15:13.580,"I said, suicides!"
00:15:13.621,00:15:16.416,Put your hand on the line!
00:15:18.959,00:15:21.921,"keep this shit up, man."
00:15:21.962,00:15:23.214,I can barely walk.
00:15:23.256,00:15:25.341,"is hella sore, son."
00:15:25.383,00:15:26.300,Gatorade or something.
00:15:27.802,00:15:29.345,"There go your girl right there, son."
00:15:29.387,00:15:30.638,Yeah.
00:15:30.680,00:15:32.056,"Hey, what's with you and her homeys?"
00:15:32.098,00:15:33.683,You gonna try to holler at 'em?
00:15:33.725,00:15:36.519,"-Man, I'm hollering at both of the friends."
00:15:36.561,00:15:39.272,"Yeah, 'cause I need that."
00:15:39.313,00:15:42.149,I can't just have one girl.
00:15:42.483,00:15:44.151,Hey.
00:15:44.193,00:15:45.403,"-What's up, baby?"
00:15:45.445,00:15:46.821,"Ladies, ladies ladies, ladies."
00:15:46.863,00:15:49.407,"Y'all heard about that two-for-one special, right?"
00:15:49.449,00:15:52.243,"Two of you, one of me."
00:15:53.703,00:15:54.954,Please.
00:15:54.995,00:15:56.163,"-Whatever, Worm."
00:15:56.205,00:15:57.415,Get your arm off me.
00:15:57.457,00:15:59.793,I like this fox.
00:15:59.834,00:16:01.711,"But, look, baby, me and you..."
00:16:01.753,00:16:04.631,And you need to tell him to stop playing it so close.
00:16:06.257,00:16:07.967,Why not?
00:16:08.008,00:16:09.594,Worm is Worm.
00:16:12.430,00:16:15.600,"Anyway, I got something for the baby today."
00:16:25.234,00:16:27.069,We don't even know if there's a baby yet.
00:16:27.111,00:16:28.947,"I mean, it's kind of early."
00:16:28.988,00:16:30.281,You ain't even been to the doctor yet.
00:16:30.323,00:16:31.616,Hello?
00:16:31.658,00:16:34.452,"I passed the pregnancy test, Kenyon. Three times."
00:16:37.497,00:16:38.539,Hm.
00:16:41.793,00:16:43.169,"These are kind of cute, though."
00:16:43.210,00:16:44.295,"I know. I got good taste, right?"
00:16:45.171,00:16:46.506,"-Yeah, a'ight."
00:16:47.423,00:16:48.883,Precious little shoes.
00:16:48.925,00:16:52.094,"Well, I got a little somethin'-somethin' for you too."
00:16:55.139,00:16:57.433,Thank you.
00:16:57.475,00:17:00.311,-This definitely is a little something.
00:17:00.353,00:17:02.981,-Where'd you get this?
00:17:03.063,00:17:05.191,Don't sleep on the 99 Cent Store?
00:17:07.026,00:17:08.903,-Kenyon!
00:17:08.945,00:17:11.614,What are you doing?
00:17:11.656,00:17:14.325,99... Are you crazy?
00:17:14.367,00:17:17.411,"You can get three brooms and a bucket for 99 cents, with some toilet paper."
00:17:17.453,00:17:20.581,That's like thread.
00:17:20.623,00:17:24.919,"Hm. Well, would you like to see me in this shoelace?"
00:17:27.005,00:17:29.423,Quick feet! Let me see your quick feet!
00:17:29.465,00:17:31.926,Touch the floor!
00:17:31.968,00:17:33.427,Three pushups and move.
00:17:33.469,00:17:36.263,One! Two! Three!
00:17:36.305,00:17:38.850,-Explode! Let me hear you.
00:17:38.892,00:17:40.476,-Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
00:17:40.518,00:17:42.854,"Explode! Worm, explode!"
00:17:42.896,00:17:44.564,Touch the floor!
00:17:44.605,00:17:47.441,Give me five!
00:17:47.483,00:17:48.735,Go! Go! Go!
00:17:48.776,00:17:49.986,Let me hear you!
00:17:50.028,00:17:53.322,"Come on, close out!"
00:17:55.783,00:17:58.160,"Sir, you're 20 minutes late."
00:18:00.204,00:18:04.458,"That's ten suicides for the whole team, 250 pushups for you."
00:18:04.500,00:18:06.168,"This ain't the track team, man."
00:18:06.210,00:18:08.713,"Nor is it the debate team, Mr. Lyle."
00:18:08.755,00:18:10.590,But you're right.
00:18:10.631,00:18:15.094,"And because you're right, that's 20 suicides for the entire team."
00:18:15.135,00:18:19.139,And you get the privilege of joining Mr. Battle with 250 pushups of your own.
00:18:19.181,00:18:21.017,"-What, are you serious?"
00:18:21.059,00:18:24.062,-This is bullshit!
00:18:24.103,00:18:26.064,"Good answer, Mr. Battle."
00:18:26.105,00:18:27.857,"Johnny, tell him what he's won."
00:18:27.899,00:18:34.906,"Because you gave such a good answer and you gave the coach attitude, you win the bonus prize of 500 pushups!"
00:18:34.948,00:18:37.450,And would you like to go for the grand prize of a thousand?
00:18:39.744,00:18:41.662,"-No, sir."
00:18:43.039,00:18:44.874,To the baseline!
00:18:44.916,00:18:46.751,On my whistle! Let's go!
00:18:46.793,00:18:48.628,"Come on, baby."
00:18:49.670,00:18:50.671,"I can't even move, son."
00:18:50.713,00:18:52.214,"Like, every muscle on my body hurts."
00:18:52.256,00:18:53.507,You can't say nothing to him.
00:18:53.549,00:18:54.675,Why can't I say nothing to him?
00:18:54.717,00:18:55.885,I'm a white boy?
00:18:56.469,00:18:57.804,"Man, what the..."
00:18:57.845,00:18:59.764,Right here. Right here.
00:18:59.806,00:19:01.057,Get this dude right here.
00:19:01.099,00:19:02.182,"Where you going, homey?"
00:19:02.224,00:19:03.309,"Where you going, huh?"
00:19:03.350,00:19:04.477,-What?
00:19:04.518,00:19:05.686,"Please don't shoot me, man."
00:19:05.728,00:19:06.980,"Go on, take my bag, dog!"
00:19:07.021,00:19:08.439,"Run your shit, homey!"
00:19:15.571,00:19:17.657,"That's some bullshit, Cruz!"
00:19:17.698,00:19:19.617,"Yo, I'm gonna visit you in County, dog."
00:19:20.618,00:19:22.536,"I'm just playing, B."
00:19:24.038,00:19:25.873,Damn!
00:19:25.915,00:19:29.752,I seen y'all walking from up the block like somebody put a pipe in your asses.
00:19:30.753,00:19:31.963,"You all right, dog?"
00:19:33.756,00:19:38.302,"Look, y'all wasn't winning with me, but y'all damn sure look sad without me."
00:19:38.344,00:19:40.179,But you know what?
00:19:40.220,00:19:41.722,See y'all get your asses kicked.
00:19:41.764,00:19:43.641,-Yo!
00:19:43.683,00:19:46.226,"I'd love to shoot the shit with you bitches all night, but I gotta go."
00:19:46.686,00:19:48.062,A'ight.
00:19:48.104,00:19:49.438,"Yo, who that, man?"
00:19:49.480,00:19:50.940,"That's my cousin, Renny."
00:19:50.982,00:19:52.566,I'm gonna check y'all.
00:19:52.608,00:19:54.694,"Yo, Worm, you need a ride?"
00:19:54.735,00:19:56.154,"Oh no, I'm straight, man."
00:19:56.195,00:19:57.822,-You sure?
00:19:57.864,00:19:59.239,"All right, my nigga."
00:19:59.281,00:20:01.075,"All right, Lyle!"
00:20:01.117,00:20:03.870,"Don't let nobody else put a pipe up your ass, or you might like it!"
00:20:08.708,00:20:10.292,"Hey, you was scared, huh?"
00:20:10.334,00:20:11.878,I wasn't scared.
00:20:11.919,00:20:14.881,The state only requires that they have a 2.0 average to play.
00:20:14.922,00:20:16.716,"Now, you got in here they need a 2.3."
00:20:16.757,00:20:22.847,"If you have a 2.0, you have to score at least 1050 on the SAT to be eligible for an athletic scholarship."
00:20:22.889,00:20:26.017,"If you have a 2.3, you only need 950."
00:20:26.851,00:20:29.395,"Now, 2.3 is just a C-plus."
00:20:29.436,00:20:32.648,It shouldn't be that hard to maintain a C-plus.
00:20:32.690,00:20:34.567,These boys are student athletes.
00:20:35.359,00:20:36.903,Student comes first.
00:20:36.944,00:20:42.366,Uh-uh. It says they gotta wear coat and ties on game days.
00:20:42.408,00:20:43.617,You gonna supply the ties?
00:20:43.659,00:20:48.164,There's a Goodwill and a Salvation Army store less than two blocks from here.
00:20:48.206,00:20:51.042,And they got a box full of ties for 50 cents apiece.
00:20:51.084,00:20:53.127,"Yo, man, what you trying to say, huh?"
00:20:53.169,00:20:55.755,"Oh, we too good to shop at the Goodwill and Salvation Army?"
00:20:55.796,00:20:57.673,-Is that it?
00:20:57.715,00:20:58.925,This is crazy!
00:20:58.966,00:21:02.178,"A dress code, and they have to sit in the front row in class?"
00:21:02.220,00:21:03.721,"This is basketball, man!"
00:21:03.763,00:21:07.058,"And basketball is a privilege, ma'am."
00:21:07.100,00:21:16.316,"If you want to play basketball on this team, these are the simple rules you have to follow, if you want to enjoy that privilege."
00:21:16.358,00:21:24.324,"Now, if you decide to follow these simple rules, I need you and the boys to sign this contract."
00:21:24.366,00:21:27.995,They can bring the contracts to practice tomorrow.
00:21:28.037,00:21:30.164,If you come to practice.
00:21:30.206,00:21:33.417,I wanna thank you all for coming out and showing your support.
00:21:33.459,00:21:35.962,And I hope I have your support the rest of the season.
00:21:37.130,00:21:38.464,Good night.
00:21:38.505,00:21:39.966,"Get up and leave like that, huh?"
00:21:40.007,00:21:42.301,"Look, I have a hard enough time getting my nephew to..."
00:21:44.511,00:21:45.512,How you gonna make them wear ties?
00:21:45.554,00:21:47.140,I want the other coach back!
00:21:59.568,00:22:01.570,"It's one of your contracts, sir."
00:22:01.612,00:22:03.948,I've amended that contract.
00:22:03.990,00:22:07.076,You require your players to maintain a 2.3 grade point average.
00:22:07.118,00:22:10.204,I've committed to maintaining a 3.5.
00:22:10.246,00:22:13.499,"You require ten hours of community service, and I've committed to 50."
00:22:13.540,00:22:20.380,"Any unexcused absences, any other disciplinary issues at school, you can nullify this agreement and send me to any school you want."
00:22:23.009,00:22:25.427,And how many days do I have to consider this offer?
00:22:25.469,00:22:27.263,None.
00:22:27.305,00:22:30.808,The second page is a letter you need to sign that confirms my withdrawal from St. Francis.
00:22:31.892,00:22:32.893,They know I'm leaving.
00:22:32.935,00:22:35.437,What? You withdrew from St. Francis?
00:22:35.479,00:22:37.648,I called Richmond.
00:22:37.690,00:22:39.650,You called Richmond?
00:22:39.692,00:22:41.068,You should have spoken to me about this.
00:22:42.528,00:22:44.071,It was a personal choice for me.
00:22:45.990,00:22:47.283,Uh-huh.
00:22:48.617,00:22:51.411,"Well, I can fix all that in the morning."
00:22:51.453,00:22:54.915,"Sir, please listen."
00:22:54.957,00:23:02.464,"If I'm one of the top students at Richmond, I mean one of the top in the whole school, and I have great SATs, I can go to any college in the country."
00:23:03.465,00:23:05.051,I'm asking you to trust me.
00:23:08.179,00:23:09.805,"You really wanna do this, huh?"
00:23:15.561,00:23:17.938,Okay.
00:23:17.980,00:23:22.526,Part of growing up is making your own decisions and living with the consequences.
00:23:27.405,00:23:30.450,3.7.
00:23:30.492,00:23:33.996,And you will earn every minute of playing time.
00:23:37.415,00:23:38.834,"Open it, please."
00:23:38.876,00:23:40.794,"-Morning, sir."
00:23:51.138,00:23:53.099,-Say what?
00:23:59.479,00:24:01.190,It's Malcolm X from St. Francis.
00:24:01.232,00:24:02.816,"-Hey, yo, Malcolm!"
00:24:04.277,00:24:05.861,"What are you doing here, son?"
00:24:05.903,00:24:07.071,I transferred to Richmond.
00:24:07.113,00:24:09.447,"Oh, no, son."
00:24:09.489,00:24:10.574,"Well, I am actually lost."
00:24:10.616,00:24:11.825,"Can you tell me how to get to, uh..."
00:24:11.867,00:24:13.202,Bel Air?
00:24:13.244,00:24:16.705,"Hey, yo, Worm, tell your man Fresh Prince here how to get to his mansion."
00:24:16.747,00:24:17.915,Fresh bitch.
00:24:21.710,00:24:24.546,"I hope seeing you in this hallway mean I get to see you on the court today, right?"
00:24:27.258,00:24:29.260,I can't wait.
00:24:29.302,00:24:31.637,With your five browns.
00:24:32.888,00:24:34.140,Everybody up.
00:24:36.350,00:24:39.019,Today we're going to play defense.
00:24:40.478,00:24:42.064,"Sorry, sir."
00:24:42.731,00:24:46.777,"Gentlemen, this is a new player, Damien Carter."
00:24:46.819,00:24:49.238,He is my son and he is late.
00:24:49.280,00:24:52.074,"Sir, you owe me 20 suicides."
00:24:52.116,00:24:54.118,"Sir, it's my first day of school. I had to stay and talk to my math..."
00:24:54.160,00:24:56.412,Basketball practice starts at 3:00.
00:24:56.454,00:24:58.705,"As of 2:55, you are late."
00:24:58.747,00:24:59.957,Get changed in the locker room.
00:24:59.999,00:25:04.003,Do your suicides on the far side of the court so as not to disturb us.
00:25:04.044,00:25:05.838,"All right, gentlemen, give me two lines."
00:25:07.589,00:25:11.718,"Okay, young sirs, we're gonna take it to the next level."
00:25:11.760,00:25:16.182,"Everything I knew about basketball, I learned from women."
00:25:17.766,00:25:21.145,I have a sister.
00:25:21.187,00:25:25.399,She was always on my case about every little thing.
00:25:25.441,00:25:28.110,"Matter of fact, she still is."
00:25:28.152,00:25:29.611,Turn down that radio!
00:25:29.653,00:25:31.697,Did you eat the last piece of cake?
00:25:31.738,00:25:33.615,Did you drink all the Kool-Aid?
00:25:34.950,00:25:36.534,in my face.
00:25:37.411,00:25:43.167,"So when I call Diane, we're gonna play straight man-to-man pressure defense."
00:25:45.585,00:25:46.712,Whoa! Whoa!
00:25:48.255,00:25:50.548,"Worm! No, no, no, no, sir."
00:25:50.590,00:25:53.135,Look at your defensive posture.
00:25:53.177,00:25:55.971,Split your man.
00:25:56.013,00:25:58.891,"This hand guards against the passing lane, this hand protects the crossover."
00:25:58.932,00:26:00.600,All right? Palms up!
00:26:00.642,00:26:01.977,Get your head in the game.
00:26:02.936,00:26:04.188,Now we have Delilah.
00:26:05.231,00:26:07.400,She was my childhood sweetheart.
00:26:07.441,00:26:09.109,"Sir, was she hot?"
00:26:09.151,00:26:10.528,"Oh, yes, sir."
00:26:10.568,00:26:13.613,She was...
00:26:15.366,00:26:20.329,"Oh, but she was the devil."
00:26:20.371,00:26:26.584,I remember once she tricked me into stealing brownies from Christ the King First Baptist Church bake sale.
00:26:26.626,00:26:33.551,"She smiled and got her way out of it, while I damn near had to wear a pillow on my butt for a month before I could sit down."
00:26:34.843,00:26:36.470,"Delilah, gentlemen."
00:26:36.512,00:26:38.638,She's our trap defense.
00:26:38.680,00:26:39.890,"Take notes, freshman."
00:26:39.932,00:26:41.517,This is as close as you gonna get to playing.
00:26:44.602,00:26:46.730,"Move, move!"
00:26:46.772,00:26:48.357,Delilah! Delilah! Delilah!
00:26:55.948,00:27:00.911,"Now, I know you're all concerned that we didn't work on our offense during practice."
00:27:00.953,00:27:02.746,We have all season to do that.
00:27:02.788,00:27:05.999,"But what did we do in practice, Mr. Stone?"
00:27:07.126,00:27:08.877,-Run.
00:27:08.919,00:27:11.671,"So, what do you think I want you to do on offense tonight?"
00:27:11.713,00:27:12.839,Run?
00:27:14.383,00:27:16.594,I want you to run.
00:27:16.634,00:27:22.391,"I want you to run every second that clock is ticking, all game long."
00:27:27.354,00:27:29.148,Put him back on the bench!
00:27:31.066,00:27:32.818,Rebound! Rebound!
00:27:32.859,00:27:34.612,"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
00:27:39.116,00:27:40.409,"Nice pass, baby!"
00:27:42.995,00:27:45.789,Push it! Screen.
00:27:45.831,00:27:47.249,Screen. Screen.
00:27:58.010,00:27:59.261,Pick him up right there!
00:27:59.303,00:28:00.429,"-Oh, yeah!"
00:28:00.471,00:28:02.306,"-Oh, yeah!"
00:28:02.348,00:28:04.517,"White four, fifth."
00:28:04.558,00:28:06.352,-He's out of the game.
00:28:06.393,00:28:07.478,"-That's his fifth foul, coach."
00:28:07.520,00:28:09.062,"-Time, sir."
00:28:09.104,00:28:10.688,"-Bad call, ref!"
00:28:10.730,00:28:12.191,"-That was a jump ball, damn it!"
00:28:12.232,00:28:13.691,"Time out, white."
00:28:13.733,00:28:15.319,"Come on, fellas."
00:28:15.361,00:28:17.070,Hustle up.
00:28:17.112,00:28:18.531,All right.
00:28:18.572,00:28:20.199,"Mr. Carter, you're in."
00:28:20.240,00:28:21.617,"But, coach, he a freshman."
00:28:21.659,00:28:22.742,You wanna coach?
00:28:24.077,00:28:25.954,All right.
00:28:25.996,00:28:27.331,Come on.
00:28:28.081,00:28:29.166,You tired?
00:28:29.208,00:28:30.501,"-No, sir."
00:28:30.543,00:28:32.085,Those guys are exhausted.
00:28:32.127,00:28:34.712,That's why this guy's gonna miss that free throw.
00:28:34.754,00:28:37.633,"When he does, Worm and Lyle are our first option."
00:28:37.675,00:28:39.426,Push the ball.
00:28:39.468,00:28:40.678,Everybody attack the boards.
00:28:40.719,00:28:41.803,-You got that?
00:28:41.845,00:28:42.888,"All right, Richmond on three."
00:28:44.097,00:28:45.974,"-One, two, three!"
00:28:46.016,00:28:47.434,"All right, let's out."
00:28:48.768,00:28:50.396,Look alive out there.
00:28:52.105,00:28:54.024,you're in better shape than they are.
00:28:54.066,00:28:55.108,Push it.
00:28:57.236,00:28:58.820,"Box out, box out."
00:29:05.994,00:29:08.914,"Yo, Kenyon, right here. Kenyon!"
00:29:08.955,00:29:10.082,Come on! Come on!
00:29:10.123,00:29:11.458,Come to the ball.
00:29:19.383,00:29:20.676,Yeah. All right.
00:29:29.184,00:29:30.352,-Worm!
00:29:32.438,00:29:33.522,"Oh, yeah!"
00:29:36.567,00:29:37.443,That's what I'm talking about!
00:29:44.742,00:29:45.867,"Tight pass, baby."
00:29:45.909,00:29:47.244,"Nice pass, dog."
00:29:47.286,00:29:48.621,It was all you.
00:29:48.662,00:29:51.831,"A win like that don't mean nothing, 'cause they can't play anyway, you feel me?"
00:29:55.210,00:29:59.673,"Okay, Shaq, so you dominated down low tonight."
00:29:59.715,00:30:02.092,"Uh, I dropped a 20-piece."
00:30:02.134,00:30:03.427,Kobe played his game.
00:30:03.469,00:30:06.096,"We the champions till we ain't the champions no more, you know?"
00:30:06.138,00:30:07.347,Junior Battle.
00:30:07.389,00:30:09.057,Undefeated until...
00:30:09.099,00:30:10.768,"Yo, man, on the real."
00:30:10.809,00:30:13.019,That was the worst game I've ever seen in my life.
00:30:13.061,00:30:14.521,I thought that shit would never end.
00:30:14.563,00:30:15.981,I was dying up in them bleachers.
00:30:16.022,00:30:17.983,"That's right, you were in the bleachers, weren't you?"
00:30:18.024,00:30:19.443,We were on the court handling our business.
00:30:19.485,00:30:22.070,That's right.
00:30:22.112,00:30:25.783,"Yo, on the real, Hercules is weak, B, and y'all barely beat 'em."
00:30:25.824,00:30:28.034,"Damn, Timo, why you throwing salt, man?"
00:30:28.076,00:30:30.788,We undefeated.
00:30:30.829,00:30:32.872,"Yeah, that's right, we undefeated."
00:30:32.914,00:30:34.625,I'll knock all y'all off.
00:30:37.628,00:30:39.004,Hey.
00:31:06.490,00:31:08.158,"Yo. I'll check y'all later, a'ight?"
00:31:08.200,00:31:09.618,A'ight.
00:31:19.628,00:31:21.129,What's up? Here's two bundles.
00:31:21.171,00:31:22.339,-All right?
00:31:22.381,00:31:23.716,"Yo, be careful."
00:31:23.757,00:31:25.091,"Yo, I got you."
00:31:27.427,00:31:28.512,"How you doing, man?"
00:31:28.554,00:31:30.764,"-Chilling, man."
00:31:31.515,00:31:32.725,Got some paper for you.
00:31:34.267,00:31:36.645,"Now we're talking, yeah."
00:31:40.566,00:31:41.817,"How you living, Timo?"
00:31:43.193,00:31:44.486,I'm good.
00:31:46.363,00:31:47.406,You all right?
00:31:47.447,00:31:48.490,Yeah.
00:31:50.409,00:31:51.535,"Here, take some."
00:31:51.577,00:31:52.661,I'm a'ight.
00:31:52.703,00:31:54.204,"No, no, no, no."
00:31:54.246,00:31:57.416,Por favor.
00:32:01.044,00:32:02.212,Thank you.
00:32:02.254,00:32:04.757,"Don't thank me, thank you."
00:32:08.719,00:32:10.220,"Take a nickel bag, okay?"
00:32:11.179,00:32:12.806,"Go get yourself something, man."
00:32:16.393,00:32:18.270,-I'm gonna see you?
00:32:18.311,00:32:19.688,"Okay, I'm gonna see you."
00:32:20.647,00:32:22.357,-Keep it up.
00:32:29.865,00:32:42.168,And move forward holler at me.
00:32:42.920,00:32:44.755,"Rafeca, I see you looking."
00:32:44.797,00:32:46.632,"Ain't nobody thinking about you, Worm."
00:32:48.341,00:32:52.095,"Gentlemen, let's review the Hercules game, shall we?"
00:32:52.137,00:32:53.722,"my numbers, sir."
00:32:53.764,00:32:57.392,"Uh, Mr. Worm, you were five and four."
00:32:57.434,00:32:59.812,"No, sir. I had 12 points and eight assists, sir."
00:32:59.853,00:33:01.605,"No, sir, Mr. Worm."
00:33:01.647,00:33:04.524,-You had five turnovers and four missed free throws.
00:33:06.234,00:33:08.779,"Now, we're talking about fundamentals here."
00:33:08.821,00:33:12.825,"Until we learn them, I'm adding a practice every morning at 6:00 a.m."
00:33:14.326,00:33:16.536,We shot 56% at...
00:33:19.247,00:33:20.499,Mr. Cruz.
00:33:21.333,00:33:23.168,"Are you lost, sir?"
00:33:23.209,00:33:24.544,What I gotta do to play?
00:33:24.586,00:33:29.048,"Mr. Cruz, you do not want to know the answer to that question."
00:33:30.300,00:33:36.556,"Now, as I was saying, as a team, we shot 56% from the line."
00:33:37.641,00:33:46.441,"From now on, before you leave my gym, you must pay an exit price of 50 made free throws -before you can go."
00:33:46.483,00:33:48.401,-That's everybody.
00:33:48.443,00:33:49.319,of free throws.
00:33:53.072,00:33:54.324,"Okay, Mr. Cruz."
00:33:55.617,00:33:59.454,"Before you can play on this team, -you owe me..."
00:34:02.958,00:34:07.086,"...2,500 pushups and 1,000 suicides."
00:34:07.128,00:34:08.547,-Damn.
00:34:11.008,00:34:12.091,Oh.
00:34:12.133,00:34:14.469,And they must be completed by Friday.
00:34:14.511,00:34:16.429,that by Friday.
00:34:16.471,00:34:17.848,making that.
00:34:18.807,00:34:22.143,Today's flavor.
00:34:23.311,00:34:26.023,"Now, I have a sister."
00:34:27.024,00:34:30.235,"Linda is smart, she's political."
00:34:30.276,00:34:32.153,"Well, actually, she's radical."
00:34:32.905,00:34:35.782,Linda's got a big Afro.
00:34:35.824,00:34:39.995,Linda is our pick-and-roll offense.
00:34:40.037,00:34:42.039,"Before we get into that, let's warm up."
00:34:43.040,00:34:44.290,Give me a lay-up line.
00:34:44.750,00:34:45.876,Let's go.
00:34:45.918,00:34:47.419,Let's do it.
00:34:48.837,00:34:50.129,"Damn, how many sisters he got?"
00:34:50.171,00:34:51.339,Who knows?
00:34:51.381,00:34:52.841,get two more over here.
00:34:55.510,00:34:57.012,Energy.
00:34:57.054,00:34:59.598,let's go.
00:34:59.639,00:35:01.182,"Right here, right here."
00:35:01.224,00:35:02.350,I'm open. I'm open!
00:35:02.392,00:35:03.852,All right.
00:35:03.894,00:35:05.478,-Come on.
00:35:05.520,00:35:06.563,-It's not my fault.
00:35:08.065,00:35:10.609,"Yes, it's important to move without the ball."
00:35:10.650,00:35:13.278,But you gotta be patient on the weak-side screen.
00:35:13.319,00:35:16.364,Set up your man and come off his shoulder hard.
00:35:16.406,00:35:18.951,-Okay? Okay.
00:35:18.992,00:35:20.118,Switch it up.
00:35:20.159,00:35:21.244,come on.

00:35:22.704,00:35:23.830,them picks.
00:35:23.872,00:35:25.206,all right.
00:35:27.459,00:35:29.878,"deepest fear, Mr. Cruz?"
00:35:31.797,00:35:33.632,That you're inadequate?
00:35:34.340,00:35:35.508,"Give up, Mr. Cruz."
00:35:37.135,00:35:38.386,Go home.
00:35:44.017,00:35:46.352,I want seven passes before you shoot.
00:35:46.394,00:35:47.562,Seven.
00:35:49.856,00:35:50.983,I got him. I got him.
00:35:51.024,00:35:52.150,Get that ball in there.
00:35:55.904,00:35:58.615,"You know your task is impossible before Friday, right?"
00:36:02.828,00:36:03.954,Move!
00:36:04.621,00:36:05.914,"Work it, work it."
00:36:08.249,00:36:10.251,Run it back.
00:36:33.316,00:36:34.901,mom getting home?
00:36:34.943,00:36:36.569,She doesn't get off for another hour.
00:36:45.662,00:36:46.913,"Oh, that's Myles."
00:36:47.539,00:36:48.707,What?
00:37:01.720,00:37:02.929,Come on.
00:37:03.722,00:37:05.724,"Say, Hi, Uncle Kenyon."
00:37:06.975,00:37:08.601,"Say, Hi."
00:37:08.643,00:37:10.395,"All right, don't worry about it."
00:37:10.436,00:37:13.065,He'll go back to sleep right after his bottle.
00:37:13.106,00:37:14.649,"Right, boo-boo?"
00:37:14.691,00:37:17.110,"Yeah, probably in time for your mom to get home."
00:37:17.152,00:37:21.489,"Or maybe when your cousin get back from getting her hair fried and dyed, like she can afford all that shit."
00:37:21.531,00:37:22.824,It's her baby anyway.
00:37:22.866,00:37:27.996,"Well, my mother had to work a double shift, but they cut her overtime."
00:37:28.038,00:37:30.456,"And my cousin, don't be trying to dis her."
00:37:30.498,00:37:32.209,You said we'd be alone.
00:37:32.250,00:37:34.502,"Well, that's why we need our own spot."
00:37:39.007,00:37:40.258,Did you turn this off?
00:37:40.299,00:37:41.426,"Yeah, it was boiling."
00:37:41.467,00:37:43.636,"Oh, come on."
00:37:43.678,00:37:45.764,"Well, turn it down, not off."
00:37:45.805,00:37:47.640,"This is milk, butter and cheese."
00:37:47.682,00:37:49.684,We can't afford to waste this.
00:37:49.726,00:37:50.936,And hold him up.
00:37:57.734,00:38:01.905,Making the baby's bottle for Myles.
00:38:01.947,00:38:03.949,"All right, Myles, here we go."
00:38:03.990,00:38:05.617,Gotta cool off a minute.
00:38:12.665,00:38:15.585,You ever think about what you were gonna do before you were pregnant?
00:38:15.627,00:38:17.837,"What you mean, going to junior college?"
00:38:17.879,00:38:19.172,Yeah.
00:38:19.214,00:38:20.882,"I mean, yeah, I thought about it."
00:38:21.758,00:38:25.053,I could go later.
00:38:25.095,00:38:27.139,You have to get some work after you have the baby.
00:38:28.265,00:38:29.474,Me too.
00:38:30.433,00:38:31.559,So I'll work.
00:38:31.601,00:38:33.270,How you gonna go to school?
00:38:33.311,00:38:34.938,Why you asking me all these questions?
00:38:34.980,00:38:37.649,And you gotta put your hands under his arm.
00:38:37.690,00:38:38.942,You gotta sit him on your chest.
00:38:38.984,00:38:40.193,Hold him.
00:38:41.736,00:38:43.238,I am...
00:38:43.280,00:38:45.991,You ain't doing it right.
00:38:46.032,00:38:47.159,Look...
00:38:49.494,00:38:51.163,I don't know how to do this.
00:38:52.538,00:38:53.665,You'll get it.
00:38:54.958,00:38:56.209,Right?
00:39:00.130,00:39:03.549,"Look, I gotta help my mom with some stuff."
00:39:04.467,00:39:05.969,"See you later, all right?"
00:39:06.011,00:39:07.345,All right.
00:39:09.848,00:39:11.349,"Call me later, okay?"
00:39:11.891,00:39:13.101,Later.
00:39:17.355,00:39:19.149,keep it riding on somebody.
00:39:19.191,00:39:21.400,-Don't get lost in there.
00:39:22.944,00:39:24.946,Stay with your man.
00:39:24.988,00:39:26.156,"Box out, box out!"
00:39:29.242,00:39:30.451,Guys...
00:39:33.038,00:39:34.331,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:39:34.372,00:39:37.125,"You don't get to your man, stand, watch the ball."
00:39:37.167,00:39:42.297,"When the ball goes up, get in good defensive position, get your body on your man and explode to the ball."
00:39:42.339,00:39:43.422,All right?
00:39:43.464,00:39:44.924,-Let's go.
00:39:44.966,00:39:46.051,Run it.
00:39:46.092,00:39:47.302,"Go on, do it."
00:39:47.344,00:39:49.137,Forward pass.
00:39:49.179,00:39:51.223,-Work it.
00:39:51.264,00:39:54.726,"Mrs. Fenton, the police are telling a very different story."
00:39:54.767,00:39:56.061,I wish you would.
00:39:56.102,00:39:57.520,"-Yes, ma'am, I'm here all week."
00:39:57.562,00:39:59.605,"Mr. Carter, how are the boys?"
00:39:59.647,00:40:00.982,"Oh, they're great, ma'am."
00:40:01.024,00:40:02.359,We're 1-0.
00:40:02.400,00:40:05.904,Very good.
00:40:05.945,00:40:12.451,"Well, um, I had my boys sign contracts requiring them to meet certain academic standards."
00:40:12.493,00:40:15.372,"Yes, I believe one of the faculty members mentioned that."
00:40:15.413,00:40:16.831,Very interesting scare tactic.
00:40:18.499,00:40:26.799,"Well, in order for that to be successful, I need their teachers to fill out weekly progress reports so I'll know how the boys are doing in their classrooms."
00:40:27.384,00:40:28.801,Okay.
00:40:28.843,00:40:31.263,"Well, I haven't received anything from their teachers."
00:40:34.557,00:40:38.644,"I don't see how this ties in to your job as the basketball coach, Mr. Carter."
00:40:38.686,00:40:41.647,"Well, I took this job with the understanding I could do it my way."
00:40:42.732,00:40:43.983,And you can.
00:40:44.025,00:40:46.027,Our next faculty meeting is in two weeks.
00:40:46.069,00:40:47.695,I'll remember to bring it up.
00:40:47.737,00:40:50.907,"Why, that would be great."
00:40:52.617,00:40:53.993,"Thank you, sir."
00:40:55.995,00:40:58.456,"-Bring it in, guys!"
00:40:59.707,00:41:01.459,"Let's go, hustle up."
00:41:01.500,00:41:04.629,y'all. Hustle up.
00:41:04.670,00:41:06.423,"All right, that's it for today."
00:41:06.464,00:41:09.634,"We have a game tomorrow, so get some rest tonight."
00:41:09.675,00:41:13.221,"And remember, ties and jackets tomorrow."
00:41:13.263,00:41:14.472,Mm-hm.
00:41:14.931,00:41:16.141,Clyde.
00:41:24.523,00:41:25.984,Mr. Cruz.
00:41:28.445,00:41:30.029,I'm impressed with what you've done.
00:41:31.489,00:41:33.825,But you came up short.
00:41:33.866,00:41:36.369,You owe me 80 suicides and 500 pushups.
00:41:38.579,00:41:40.165,Please leave my gym.
00:41:43.001,00:41:44.710,"Thanks, Clyde."
00:41:44.752,00:41:46.379,"Gentlemen, see you tomorrow."
00:41:50.216,00:41:51.426,I'll do pushups for him.
00:41:57.556,00:41:58.850,You said we're a team.
00:42:00.059,00:42:03.313,"One person struggles, we all struggle."
00:42:03.355,00:42:05.731,"One player triumphs, we all triumph, right?"
00:42:22.665,00:42:23.875,I'll do some.
00:42:24.834,00:42:26.211,I'll run suicides too.
00:43:03.373,00:43:05.041,I'll do some too.
00:43:12.257,00:43:14.008,"Clyde, let's keep count."
00:43:16.802,00:43:18.054,Call me when they're done.
00:43:23.393,00:43:25.186,Defense! Defense!
00:43:25.228,00:43:26.479,Push it. Push it.
00:43:26.521,00:43:27.688,"Move, move!"
00:43:27.730,00:43:29.315,Let's go.
00:43:32.235,00:43:33.652,"Ball, ball, ball."
00:43:34.737,00:43:35.905,Yeah!
00:43:39.576,00:43:40.868,"Move your feet, move your feet."
00:43:42.036,00:43:43.455,"Go, defense. Go."
00:43:44.789,00:43:46.249,Good job.
00:43:46.291,00:43:47.666,-Worm.
00:43:47.708,00:43:49.252,"Palms up, move your feet, right?"
00:43:49.294,00:43:50.462,Come out.
00:43:50.503,00:43:51.588,Come out. Come out.
00:43:51.629,00:43:52.713,Mr. Cruz!
00:43:52.755,00:43:54.257,"-Good game, boy."
00:43:56.551,00:43:57.885,"Hey, hey."
00:43:58.928,00:44:00.679,"What is your deepest fear, young man?"
00:44:03.600,00:44:05.560,Go on.
00:44:05.602,00:44:07.228,Why he keep saying that.
00:44:07.270,00:44:08.354,What that mean?
00:44:10.689,00:44:11.857,Let's go. Let's go.
00:44:11.899,00:44:14.068,Move. Move. Move.
00:44:14.860,00:44:16.112,"No, one more pass."
00:44:24.745,00:44:26.747,Hands up.
00:44:26.789,00:44:28.333,Let's go.
00:44:39.344,00:44:41.304,Get back! Get back!
00:45:16.755,00:45:18.090,"What the hell are you doing, Cruz?"
00:45:18.132,00:45:19.592,-You allergic to lay-ups?
00:45:19.634,00:45:22.011,"You do that again, you're gonna be glued to the bench."
00:45:32.771,00:45:34.566,"Come on, last kick."
00:45:34.607,00:45:35.900,Kick it in. Kick it in.
00:45:35.941,00:45:37.026,Let's go.
00:45:37.068,00:45:38.570,All right.
00:45:40.821,00:45:41.989,"Ball, ball, ball."
00:45:45.910,00:45:46.994,"You can't guard me, can you?"
00:45:47.036,00:45:48.454,What you gonna do?
00:45:48.496,00:45:49.622,"Can't do nothing about it, can you?"
00:45:49.664,00:45:50.789,Delilah. Delilah!
00:45:50.831,00:45:51.874,"Come on, come on, come on."
00:45:53.251,00:45:54.544,"Yeah, Jason."
00:45:59.632,00:46:00.925,"Kenyon, pose for me."
00:46:01.384,00:46:02.635,Smile.
00:46:02.677,00:46:04.429,Get back!
00:46:04.470,00:46:05.722,Just play the damn game.
00:46:07.223,00:46:08.558,"Linda, Linda, Linda!"
00:46:12.729,00:46:13.938,Yeah.
00:46:13.979,00:46:15.690,"That's me, baby."
00:46:15.732,00:46:19.611,I did that!
00:46:21.070,00:46:22.280,Run it again.
00:46:23.406,00:46:24.781,"All right, 1-4, 1-4."
00:46:24.823,00:46:25.950,"Linda, Linda, Linda!"
00:46:31.080,00:46:33.249,"All day, baby. All day!"
00:46:33.291,00:46:36.085,Can't stop that.
00:46:37.587,00:46:39.547,"Hey, coach, your shoe's untied, sir."
00:46:39.589,00:46:41.090,"Oh. Thank you, Mr. Worm."
00:46:44.093,00:46:46.011,Whoo!
00:46:46.053,00:46:49.932,Look at that!
00:46:49.974,00:46:51.350,Can I get something on the bow?
00:46:51.392,00:46:54.895,Let me get some.
00:46:54.937,00:46:58.941,What is wrong with you?
00:47:00.067,00:47:03.362,Since when is winning not enough?
00:47:03.404,00:47:06.073,Playing hard not enough?
00:47:07.283,00:47:10.995,No. You have to humiliate your opponent.
00:47:11.036,00:47:14.039,Taunt him after every score.
00:47:14.081,00:47:16.417,You won four games last season.
00:47:16.875,00:47:18.294,Four.
00:47:18.336,00:47:24.592,What gives you the right to taint the game that I love with trash talk and taunting?
00:47:24.634,00:47:29.305,What gives you the right to wear Richmond on your chests and act like punks?
00:47:29.347,00:47:30.473,"Coach, they were jawing too."
00:47:30.515,00:47:31.932,So?
00:47:31.974,00:47:33.768,You can't show some class?
00:47:33.810,00:47:35.645,Act like a champion?
00:47:39.315,00:47:41.442,You owe me 500 pushups apiece.
00:47:42.443,00:47:43.860,On the line!
00:47:43.902,00:47:45.321,Now!
00:47:45.363,00:47:47.198,"Oh, man, come on."
00:48:04.131,00:48:06.509,"I'm just gonna be real with you, okay?"
00:48:07.385,00:48:08.720,You're my girl.
00:48:09.512,00:48:13.265,I get out on that court and everything is just getting crazy...
00:48:13.307,00:48:15.601,All I gotta do is just think about you.
00:48:16.101,00:48:17.770,Mr. Lyle.
00:48:17.812,00:48:19.856,Why aren't you in...
00:48:21.482,00:48:22.608,geometry?
00:48:22.650,00:48:23.860,"I'm going there right now, sir."
00:48:25.194,00:48:26.779,"Sir, this is Betty."
00:48:26.821,00:48:29.365,-Bella.
00:48:29.407,00:48:30.616,Go to class.
00:48:36.163,00:48:39.916,Don't forget that these projects are due at the end of this week.
00:48:39.958,00:48:42.294,"-So if any of you need extra time-- -Excuse me, sir."
00:48:42.336,00:48:43.671,-Are you Mr. Gesek?
00:48:43.713,00:48:48.634,"I, um, don't see Junior Battle in this class."
00:48:48.676,00:48:51.804,Junior Battle is like a solar eclipse.
00:48:51.846,00:48:53.514,We rarely see him.
00:48:53.556,00:48:55.349,"But when we do, it's always special."
00:48:57.934,00:48:59.353,Thank you.
00:49:00.937,00:49:03.775,Surprise arrival to the poll is Richmond High at 19th.
00:49:03.816,00:49:05.359,"Top 20, baby."
00:49:05.401,00:49:07.194,-What did you say?
00:49:07.236,00:49:13.534,"The Oilers have posted a perfect 9-0 mark, winning on the road against perennial powerhouses Xavier and Baxter Union."
00:49:17.413,00:49:19.248,"Junior, you should read the rest of this, man."
00:49:19.290,00:49:20.499,They blowing you up in this paper.
00:49:21.709,00:49:23.127,"Come on, man, read it."
00:49:23.168,00:49:24.837,"Man, you know he can't read."
00:49:24.879,00:49:26.798,"-Man, shut up."
00:49:29.258,00:49:37.349,has been big as the Oilers are 'boyed.' The word is buoyed.
00:49:39.226,00:49:43.689,by Junior Battle's 19.8-rebound-a-night numbers.
00:49:43.731,00:49:46.943,"that's my big nigga right there, son."
00:49:46.983,00:49:50.446,"Hey. If you was any bigger, you'd be my bigger nigga."
00:49:52.782,00:49:54.158,Sit down. Sit down!
00:50:02.750,00:50:10.549,Nigga is a derogatory term used to insult our ancestors.
00:50:10.591,00:50:13.719,"See, if a white man used it, you'd be ready to fight."
00:50:13.761,00:50:16.764,Your using it teaches him to use it.
00:50:16.806,00:50:20.142,You're saying it's cool.
00:50:20.184,00:50:22.186,"And when you're around me, I don't wanna hear that shit."
00:50:22.227,00:50:23.479,We clear?
00:50:23.521,00:50:24.981,"-Yes, sir."
00:50:25.021,00:50:26.607,"-Yes, sir."
00:50:30.235,00:50:35.073,"Mr. Worm, what is it you want out of this basketball season?"
00:50:35.115,00:50:37.075,"To win that state championship, sir."
00:50:39.787,00:50:42.915,"Well, who won the state basketball championship last season, Lyle?"
00:50:43.958,00:50:45.250,"Hell if I know, sir."
00:50:46.002,00:50:47.753,Hm. Does anybody know?
00:50:51.173,00:50:53.258,Okay.
00:50:53.300,00:50:54.969,"What's your father do for a living, Mr. Lyle?"
00:50:59.724,00:51:01.642,"My father's in jail, sir."
00:51:03.185,00:51:04.269,Oh.
00:51:05.521,00:51:07.940,"Well, I'm sorry to hear that, sir."
00:51:07.982,00:51:10.234,But that doesn't have to be your life.
00:51:11.736,00:51:13.404,My point's this.
00:51:13.445,00:51:15.948,I have four seniors on this team.
00:51:15.990,00:51:19.201,"Junior, Lyle, Kenyon and Worm."
00:51:19.243,00:51:22.955,"All of whom, I think, can play basketball at the college level."
00:51:22.997,00:51:24.331,College.
00:51:25.708,00:51:28.627,That's a viable option for all of you.
00:51:28.669,00:51:32.631,But you have to perform in the classroom to have that chance.
00:51:33.549,00:51:35.051,You have to have a vision.
00:51:36.719,00:51:40.472,"Tell me, how do you see yourselves?"
00:51:42.641,00:51:44.476,"ESPN, baby."
00:51:45.770,00:51:47.354,"That reminds me, Mr. Battle."
00:51:48.355,00:51:53.193,Mr. Gesek tells me he doesn't see you in his classroom very often.
00:51:53.235,00:51:55.905,"Yeah, we cool, though, me and him."
00:51:55.947,00:51:57.949,Mr. Gesek is a big basketball fan.
00:51:58.282,00:51:59.617,Mm-hm.
00:51:59.658,00:52:01.869,"Well, as of now, you're suspended."
00:52:01.911,00:52:07.666,"Oh, you can practice, but you can't play, until Mr. Gesek tells me you're caught up in his class."
00:52:07.708,00:52:10.419,And that's a shout out to the rest of you.
00:52:10.461,00:52:13.464,You signed a contract.
00:52:13.505,00:52:17.551,"Now, I have your schedules and I'll be getting reports from your teachers."
00:52:17.593,00:52:21.430,"If you don't perform in the classroom, you will not play."
00:52:22.264,00:52:23.808,What's up with that?
00:52:24.516,00:52:26.142,"Sit down, Mr. Battle."
00:52:28.771,00:52:31.523,"All right, that's 500 pushups."
00:52:33.109,00:52:35.027,"Man, this is bullshit!"
00:52:35.069,00:52:37.321,"We won those games, not you."
00:52:37.362,00:52:40.783,"That's 1,000 pushups for Mr. Battle, Clyde."
00:52:40.825,00:52:42.493,"You wanna try for 2,000?"
00:52:59.468,00:53:04.890,"Young man, think about the choice you're making if you walk out that door."
00:53:14.025,00:53:15.275,To the baseline.
00:53:20.031,00:53:23.241,-How about LaQuisha if it's a girl.
00:53:23.283,00:53:24.660,LaQuisha?
00:53:24.702,00:53:26.078,"Okay, yeah."
00:53:26.120,00:53:28.164,"The ghetto called, and they want they name back."
00:53:28.204,00:53:29.331,"Girl, LaQuisha?"
00:53:29.373,00:53:30.541,Be for real.
00:53:30.582,00:53:32.250,You might as well call the baby Food Stamp.
00:53:33.335,00:53:34.670,You're stupid.
00:53:34.712,00:53:36.922,All right.
00:53:34.712,00:53:39.133,I was thinking I could call her Harmony.
00:53:39.800,00:53:40.885,"Ooh, I like Harmony."
00:53:40.926,00:53:42.344,"Harmony, oh, that's good."
00:53:42.386,00:53:43.428,What did Kenyon say?
00:53:44.388,00:53:45.723,"Please, he want a boy."
00:53:45.764,00:53:47.058,Figures.
00:53:47.099,00:53:48.726,Speaking of Michael Jordan...
00:53:48.767,00:53:50.435,"Yo, what's wrong with a girl?"
00:53:50.477,00:53:54.023,"Yeah, dog, boys grow into men, and men ain't worth the trouble."
00:53:54.065,00:53:56.441,Don't you have someplace to go?
00:53:57.818,00:54:00.278,Guess he wants me all to himself.
00:54:00.320,00:54:02.156,See you later.
00:54:02.198,00:54:03.741,"Girl, don't forget, I need your notes for history."
00:54:03.782,00:54:06.077,"-All right, I got you."
00:54:08.829,00:54:11.623,I bought us tickets to the dance.
00:54:11.665,00:54:14.292,Why you telling these loudmouth girls about the baby?
00:54:14.334,00:54:15.711,Now everybody's gonna know.
00:54:16.670,00:54:18.547,"People are gonna know, Kenyon."
00:54:18.589,00:54:20.174,"Well, it's not people's business, Kyra."
00:54:20.216,00:54:21.592,Why you jumping down my throat?
00:54:21.633,00:54:22.718,What's wrong with you?
00:54:24.136,00:54:28.348,"Look, me and coach been talking, and he thinks I can play college ball."
00:54:28.390,00:54:30.601,"All right, so?"
00:54:30.642,00:54:32.978,So how am I gonna do that and raise a baby?
00:54:34.146,00:54:36.523,I don't know.
00:54:36.565,00:54:39.902,"I mean, I'm not saying that it won't be hard."
00:54:39.944,00:54:43.072,Hard? It's already hard.
00:54:39.944,00:54:46.450,"The kid ain't even here yet and I'm already worried about how I'm gonna feed it, how I'm gonna pay for this and that."
00:54:47.576,00:54:50.328,Everything.
00:54:50.370,00:54:52.623,"So, what are you saying?"
00:54:52.664,00:54:54.250,Is that what you're saying?
00:54:54.290,00:54:56.252,Go ahead and say it.
00:54:56.292,00:54:59.255,"Look, if I wanted to be out, I would've been out by now, Kyra."
00:54:59.295,00:55:01.297,That's not it at all.
00:55:01.339,00:55:02.800,I wanna be with you.
00:55:02.841,00:55:04.760,"Yeah, as long as it's convenient."
00:55:04.802,00:55:06.553,I'm just trying to think about what's best for both of us.
00:55:06.595,00:55:08.597,You're not trying to think about what's best for both of us.
00:55:08.639,00:55:11.058,You're thinking about what's best for you.
00:55:11.100,00:55:12.768,You don't want me to have this baby.
00:55:12.810,00:55:14.645,You wanna leave Richmond.
00:55:14.686,00:55:16.480,You wanna go play college ball.
00:55:16.521,00:55:17.815,So guess what?
00:55:17.856,00:55:21.902,"We ain't got to be ready enough for nothing, all right?"
00:55:21.944,00:55:25.823,I'm ready enough to do what I gotta do all by my damn self.
00:55:23.779,00:55:27.532,So you can take these and go to the dance yourself.
00:55:30.702,00:55:32.537,Progress reports?
00:55:32.579,00:55:33.956,"Look, ma'am, we talked about this."
00:55:33.998,00:55:35.373,I don't see what the problem is.
00:55:35.415,00:55:36.834,"Do you know what the API is, Mr. Carter?"
00:55:36.875,00:55:38.543,"No, I don't."
00:55:38.585,00:55:40.296,The Academic Performance Index.
00:55:40.336,00:55:43.924,"They judge schools on a scale of one to ten, ten being the best."
00:55:43.966,00:55:46.342,Do you have any idea where Richmond falls on that scale?
00:55:46.384,00:55:47.552,"No, ma'am, I have no idea."
00:55:47.594,00:55:50.681,"We're a one, Mr. Carter, and have been for the last seven years."
00:55:50.722,00:55:52.724,The state rewards schools for their performance.
00:55:52.766,00:55:55.311,So every year I have less money to pay faculty and staff.
00:55:55.351,00:55:58.105,"-Look, ma'am-- -Can I ask what it is you want, Mr. Carter?"
00:55:58.147,00:55:59.397,I want my boys to go to college.
00:55:59.439,00:56:00.816,College?
00:56:00.858,00:56:04.945,"Mr. Carter, Richmond graduates 50% of its students, the higher percentage being girls."
00:56:04.987,00:56:09.741,"Now, in my very educated opinion, you have 15 players on your team, you'll be lucky to graduate five of them."
00:56:09.783,00:56:11.869,"Well, I'm sorry, ma'am, but I don't agree with you."
00:56:11.910,00:56:13.620,"Look, these boys signed contracts."
00:56:13.662,00:56:17.582,"Maybe if you'd read one of 'em-- Your job is to win basketball games, Mr. Carter."
00:56:17.624,00:56:19.668,I suggest you start doing your job.
00:56:19.710,00:56:22.296,And your job is to educate these kids.
00:56:22.338,00:56:25.007,I suggest you start doing yours.
00:56:39.063,00:56:40.480,Well...
00:56:41.315,00:56:43.441,We had another good week.
00:56:43.483,00:56:46.153,"Yeah, business is very good, Kenny."
00:56:47.738,00:56:48.906,But I'm on my own.
00:56:48.947,00:56:50.991,You're never here.
00:56:51.033,00:56:52.993,"Look, I appreciate everything you do."
00:56:53.035,00:56:54.203,And I promise you...
00:56:54.245,00:56:55.704,We're closed.
00:56:55.746,00:56:57.831,"As soon as the season is over, I will be here for you."
00:56:57.873,00:56:58.916,Mr. Carter?
00:56:59.375,00:57:00.458,I'm...
00:57:00.500,00:57:01.752,Junior Battle's mother.
00:57:01.793,00:57:03.212,"Yes, ma'am, I remember you."
00:57:03.254,00:57:04.671,Willa.
00:57:04.713,00:57:05.839,Willa Battle.
00:57:07.341,00:57:08.759,"How may I help you, ma'am?"
00:57:08.800,00:57:13.305,"Mr. Carter, I got a phone call today from a coach at a junior college in Sacramento."
00:57:13.347,00:57:15.224,"Now, they wanna see Junior play this Friday."
00:57:15.266,00:57:19.728,"Well, that's great, ma'am, but Junior broke some rules-- And I agree with 'em."
00:57:19.770,00:57:22.147,I'm not here to argue with your rules.
00:57:22.522,00:57:23.732,I'm not.
00:57:26.985,00:57:32.824,"Almost two years ago now, Junior's older brother, Anton, was..."
00:57:34.534,00:57:39.206,"killed, and it's been confusing and hard for me, and for Junior."
00:57:40.958,00:57:48.757,"After you lose a son, every time the phone rings, your heart stops."
00:57:51.385,00:57:54.138,"Now, I'm not asking for special attention."
00:57:54.179,00:57:58.100,I agree he needs to get straight with his classes.
00:57:58.142,00:58:01.979,But the idea of junior college had never even occurred to my son.
00:58:02.020,00:58:06.191,"Now, I could move to the Hercules school district, and he could play there."
00:58:06.233,00:58:10.612,But moving is not gonna solve-- But I want him to play for you.
00:58:12.530,00:58:17.035,"Look, I'm not gonna stand here and say I know how it feels to lose a son, because I don't."
00:58:18.536,00:58:22.166,And I do appreciate you putting your trust in me.
00:58:24.001,00:58:25.627,But I need to hear that from Junior.
00:58:26.170,00:58:27.629,He in the car.
00:58:45.356,00:58:46.523,Go on.
00:58:52.363,00:58:54.865,I'm sorry for what I said and did at practice.
00:58:54.906,00:58:57.034,"And I promise to get caught up with my classes, sir."
00:59:02.956,00:59:04.624,"Look me in the eye, sir."
00:59:10.172,00:59:15.844,"Everything inside me tells me if I take you back, I'd be making a mistake, and you'll make a fool of me."
00:59:15.886,00:59:17.262,"No, sir."
00:59:20.432,00:59:25.521,"You owe me 1,000 pushups and 1,000 suicides before you can play."
00:59:25.562,00:59:27.231,I'll see you at practice tomorrow.
00:59:30.317,00:59:31.651,"Thank you, sir."
00:59:36.948,00:59:38.242,Thank you.
00:59:41.328,00:59:43.288,And you gonna do every last one of them.
00:59:43.330,00:59:45.332,Quitting basketball like you pay rent.
00:59:45.374,00:59:47.000,I don't know who you think you are.
00:59:47.042,00:59:50.587,"The next time you make a decision, you better ask me first."
00:59:50.628,00:59:53.048,"you did your thing tonight, man."
00:59:53.090,00:59:54.425,"Good looking out, yo."
00:59:54.466,00:59:55.759,"good shot, Junior."
00:59:55.800,00:59:56.927,"Yeah, no doubt."
00:59:58.595,01:00:03.308,I just received a call from the director of the Bayhill Holiday Tournament.
01:00:03.350,01:00:05.769,You have been invited.
01:00:07.271,01:00:08.480,"Yeah, baby!"
01:00:09.189,01:00:10.399,Yeah!
01:00:10.441,01:00:12.817,"Whoa, whoa."
01:00:12.859,01:00:14.611,"Now, I have more good news."
01:00:14.652,01:00:16.696,I spoke to Principal Garrison today.
01:00:16.738,01:00:23.161,She informs me that all your teachers will have your academic-progress reports prepared by the end of holiday break.
01:00:23.203,01:00:24.996,"Sir, our grades are tight, yo."
01:00:25.038,01:00:28.666,"Yo, not only are our grades all right, coach, but we undefeated, homeboy."
01:00:28.708,01:00:30.294,Yeah!
01:00:44.015,01:00:47.685,"who came out to the Richmond High winter dance, y'all!"
01:00:47.727,01:00:49.438,Get down!
01:01:13.545,01:01:15.297,"for the new kings of Richmond, y'all!"
01:01:15.339,01:01:17.257,"Yeah! Give it up, baby!"
01:01:17.299,01:01:22.346,"Yo, we 12-0, y'all, and I just wanna say I wanna see all the beautiful people up at that tournament."

01:17:39.947,01:17:41.365,"Oh, my God, it's Susan's dad."
01:17:41.407,01:17:42.617,You see your son?
01:17:51.792,01:17:53.127,Damien Carter.
01:17:54.378,01:17:55.546,Get your ass out of that pool.
01:17:56.964,01:17:57.881,"Yes, sir."
01:17:58.924,01:18:00.510,"Richmond High players, let's go!"
01:18:02.178,01:18:03.596,Coach!
01:18:03.638,01:18:05.139,where did you go?
01:18:05.181,01:18:06.474,Worm?
01:18:08.017,01:18:09.685,"What up, coach?"
01:18:09.726,01:18:12.271,I got somebody I want you to meet.
01:18:12.313,01:18:15.065,"Now, I just met her, but she is fine as hell."
01:18:15.816,01:18:17.067,Her name is...
01:18:17.109,01:18:18.277,Susan!
01:18:19.111,01:18:21.405,-Susan. He right!
01:18:21.447,01:18:23.491,My daughter. Susan.
01:18:25.409,01:18:29.288,going to like what happens in practice on Monday.
01:18:29.330,01:18:31.832,You think you've run for me before?
01:18:31.874,01:18:35.670,"I come to your rooms to celebrate with you, and you sneak..."
01:18:39.298,01:18:48.307,"I end up taking a road trip to the suburbs, where I find my drunk-ass point guard on top of Daddy's little princess!"
01:18:48.349,01:18:49.766,"Actually, I was on the bottom, coach."
01:18:49.808,01:18:51.768,She was on the top.
01:18:51.810,01:18:54.647,"Worm, do you wanna be on this team?"
01:18:54.689,01:18:59.485,'Cause you're about six words from getting kicked off and kicked off the goddamn bus!
01:19:00.570,01:19:02.154,"Cruz, open your eyes!"
01:19:03.406,01:19:05.575,Ghetto hoop stars!
01:19:05.616,01:19:09.328,Signing autographs and humping the honeys!
01:19:09.370,01:19:12.998,"Well, I'm gonna show you what humping is."
01:19:13.040,01:19:16.168,"Coach, we won the tournament."
01:19:16.752,01:19:18.337,We undefeated.
01:19:18.379,01:19:19.630,"I mean, ain't that what you wanted?"
01:19:20.506,01:19:22.216,Winners?
01:20:35.498,01:20:36.582,"Oh, no."
01:20:38.584,01:20:40.461,"Oh, no, no, no."
01:20:40.961,01:20:43.005,"Oh, no!"
01:20:47.843,01:20:48.885,God!
01:21:00.897,01:21:02.024,You guys are awesome!
01:21:03.484,01:21:04.652,Whoo!
01:21:18.248,01:21:21.418,I don't know.
01:21:25.881,01:21:27.424,where the library's even at.
01:21:27.466,01:21:29.552,-I bet you don't.
01:21:29.593,01:21:31.011,where the library's at.
01:21:49.739,01:21:51.031,Quiet!
01:21:52.366,01:21:58.831,"Gentlemen, in this hand, I hold contracts signed by me and signed by you."
01:21:58.873,01:22:04.044,"In this hand, I hold academic progress reports prepared by your teachers."
01:22:04.086,01:22:11.218,"We have six players failing at least one class, eight players getting incompletes based on attendance."
01:22:11.260,01:22:16.014,"Gentlemen, you have failed to up..."
01:22:17.307,01:22:19.602,We have failed.
01:22:19.643,01:22:22.187,We have failed each other.
01:22:22.229,01:22:24.940,"Now, there are some of you who have upheld this contract."
01:22:24.981,01:22:28.611,But know that we are a team.
01:22:28.652,01:22:33.532,"And until we all meet the terms of this contract, the gym will remain locked."
01:22:33.574,01:22:34.784,-Locked?
01:22:34.825,01:22:35.951,"What you mean, locked?"
01:22:35.992,01:22:37.202,"What, like for the day?"
01:22:37.244,01:22:38.537,for today.
01:22:38.579,01:22:44.627,"Mr. Thompson, Mr. Gesek and Miss Sherman have generously volunteered their time to help us reach our goals."
01:22:44.668,01:22:46.253,"But, coach, I have a 3.3."
01:22:46.295,01:22:47.963,"That's good, sir."
01:22:48.004,01:22:49.965,Do you score all the points for the team too?
01:22:53.176,01:22:55.554,We are the Richmond Oilers.
01:22:56.889,01:22:59.224,Do you know what Oilers stands for?
01:23:02.937,01:23:03.938,Sir?
01:23:05.731,01:23:07.858,Know that you're not just walking out on me.
01:23:08.651,01:23:10.277,You're walking out on them.
01:23:11.737,01:23:13.113,I had to beg you.
01:23:15.324,01:23:17.075,And then I ran all those sprints.
01:23:18.368,01:23:20.120,I did all that shit.
01:23:20.162,01:23:24.040,"I killed myself for you, sir, to get back on the team."
01:23:28.128,01:23:29.588,This is bullshit.
01:23:52.569,01:23:56.031,You put a lock on the gym and forced them to meet you in the library?
01:23:56.072,01:23:57.574,-Are you crazy?
01:23:57.616,01:23:59.743,I'm surprised you know where my office is.
01:23:59.785,01:24:01.453,Take the lock off that gym.
01:24:01.495,01:24:03.246,My phone hasn't stopped ringing.
01:24:03.288,01:24:06.750,Maybe someone on the other end of that phone has a solution to our problem.
01:24:06.792,01:24:10.086,"Your intentions are good, Mr. Carter, but your methods are a bit extreme."
01:24:10.128,01:24:12.506,You painted an extreme picture.
01:24:12.548,01:24:15.718,"No one expects them to graduate, no one expects them to go to college."
01:24:15.759,01:24:19.638,"So you take away basketball, the one area of their lives where they have some success?"
01:24:19.680,01:24:20.764,"Yes, ma'am."
01:24:20.806,01:24:22.140,And you challenge them academically?
01:24:22.182,01:24:23.392,"Yes, ma'am."
01:24:23.433,01:24:25.769,-And what if they fail?
01:24:28.063,01:24:34.737,"Unfortunately, Mr. Carter, both you and I know that for some of these kids, this basketball season will be the highlight of their lives."
01:24:36.279,01:24:38.032,"Well, I think that's the problem."
01:24:38.657,01:24:39.950,Don't you?
01:25:05.392,01:25:07.603,"-Good morning, Coach Carter."
01:25:07.644,01:25:09.312,Quite the Pandora's box you've opened.
01:25:09.354,01:25:11.106,"Oh, I get all the blame now?"
01:25:11.147,01:25:12.983,Let's just say I'm happy to give you all the credit.
01:25:13.025,01:25:17.529,-I've got every news reporter in town waiting to speak to you.
01:25:17.571,01:25:20.741,Got a press conference set up around the front of the gymnasium.
01:25:20.783,01:25:24.912,Coach Carter has taken the lockout to the next level by canceling last night's game.
01:25:24.954,01:25:28.707,"Richmond forfeited the game, making it their first loss of the season."
01:25:28.749,01:25:30.876,"And for now, the lock remains on the gym."
01:25:30.918,01:25:32.502,Here he comes.
01:25:32.544,01:25:34.964,Coach Carter! Coach!
01:25:35.005,01:25:37.424,Can I get a question?
01:25:37.466,01:25:38.717,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen."
01:25:38.759,01:25:40.594,I'd like to thank you for your patience.
01:25:40.636,01:25:43.472,"At this time, I'd like to introduce Coach Ken Carter."
01:25:43.513,01:25:45.099,You may direct your questions to him.
01:25:46.308,01:25:50.813,"Mr. Carter, is it unfair to the players whose grades qualify them to play?"
01:25:50.854,01:25:53.065,"Basketball's a team sport, sir."
01:25:53.107,01:25:55.109,We support each other on and off the court.
01:25:55.150,01:25:57.987,Anybody still think coach bluffing now?
01:25:58.028,01:26:03.283,"You know, I feel like running right up in the middle of all those reporters and telling them I think this is bullshit, son."
01:26:03.325,01:26:05.828,"Maybe you should've gone to class, Lyle."
01:26:05.869,01:26:07.621,"Maybe you should kiss my ass, dog."
01:26:07.663,01:26:08.789,"My grades are fine, homeboy."
01:26:08.831,01:26:10.332,It's Junior they should've locked out.
01:26:10.373,01:26:11.750,"Hey, hold up."
01:26:11.792,01:26:13.627,"Why don't you try spelling it, then, homeboy."
01:26:13.669,01:26:15.712,"Chill, chill, chill, man. Damn."
01:26:15.754,01:26:16.964,"Junior, if you need help, I'll tutor you."
01:26:17.006,01:26:18.590,"Man, I don't need no help."
01:26:18.632,01:26:21.551,"Well, he ain't lock us out for no reason."
01:26:21.593,01:26:24.138,"We been tripping lately, man."
01:26:24.179,01:26:26.598,the community's gonna react to this lockout?
01:26:27.724,01:26:29.018,I hope they'll support these young men.
01:26:29.893,01:26:32.146,"What, man?"
01:26:32.187,01:26:37.943,"No, man, it's just funny, dog, because, Junior, man, you thought it was bad all us knew your dumb ass was failing science."
01:26:37.985,01:26:40.487,Now the whole world about to know your dumb ass failing science.
01:26:40.529,01:26:42.238,"-Aw, man."
01:26:45.200,01:26:48.411,"And you have Fremont this Saturday, the biggest game on your schedule."
01:26:48.453,01:26:52.457,"Now, Richmond is gonna riot if you forfeit that game."
01:26:52.499,01:26:55.002,Saturday is a long way off.
01:26:55.711,01:26:57.420,Thank you all for coming.
01:26:57.462,01:26:59.048,That's all the time I have right now.
01:26:59.089,01:27:01.299,have you talked to any of the parents?
01:27:03.259,01:27:04.803,"Thank you for your time, ladies and gentlemen."
01:27:04.845,01:27:10.559,"I'd like to remind you that classes are in session, so as you leave campus, please do so quietly."
01:27:12.102,01:27:13.436,I ain't turning the cheek.
01:27:13.478,01:27:15.647,"He come up in my 'hood, I'm serious, it's on."
01:27:15.689,01:27:17.024,Young sirs.
01:27:17.066,01:27:18.192,It's always been like that.
01:27:18.233,01:27:21.111,It's been a long day.
01:27:21.778,01:27:23.780,Media everywhere.
01:27:23.822,01:27:27.910,Let's take this time to say whatever it is we want while the doors are closed.
01:27:27.951,01:27:31.705,You have the floor.
01:27:31.747,01:27:33.790,"Man, this shit ain't about us."
01:27:33.832,01:27:35.291,This is all about Coach Carter.
01:27:35.333,01:27:37.211,We're the basketball team.
01:27:37.252,01:27:41.131,"All I see is you on TV, getting famous, eating that shit up."
01:27:41.173,01:27:43.217,-Is that all you see?
01:27:45.635,01:27:48.138,"Well, let me tell you what I see."
01:27:48.180,01:27:53.602,I see a system that's designed for you to fail.
01:27:53.643,01:27:56.354,"Now, I know you all like stats, so let me give you some."
01:27:56.396,01:28:00.109,Richmond High only graduates 50% of its students.
01:28:00.150,01:28:05.488,"And of those that do graduate, only 6% go to college."
01:28:05.530,01:28:15.540,"Which tells me, when I walk down these halls and I look in your classrooms, maybe only one student is going to go to college."
01:28:15.582,01:28:19.253,"Well, damn, Coach Carter, if I ain't going to college, where I'm gonna go?"
01:28:19.294,01:28:21.671,"Now, that's a great question."
01:28:21.713,01:28:29.179,"And the answer for young African-American men in here is this, probably to prison."
01:28:29.721,01:28:37.646,"In this county, 33% of black males between 18 and 24 get arrested."
01:28:39.522,01:28:40.983,So look at the guy on your left.
01:28:41.984,01:28:43.735,Now look at the guy on your right.
01:28:45.821,01:28:47.239,One of you is gonna get arrested.
01:28:48.698,01:28:54.454,"Growing up here in Richmond, you're 80% more likely to go to prison than college."
01:28:55.998,01:28:57.666,Those are the numbers.
01:28:59.209,01:29:01.170,Those are some stats for your ass.
01:29:02.254,01:29:13.140,"Now, I want you to go home and look at your lives tonight and look at your parents' lives and ask yourself, Do I want better?"
01:29:14.683,01:29:18.228,"If the answer is yes, I'll see you here tomorrow."
01:29:19.938,01:29:29.489,And I promise you I will do everything in my power to get you to college and to a better life.
01:29:57.226,01:29:58.392,I don't understand this.
01:29:58.434,01:30:01.104,"It's a letter, how can it be a number? Huh?"
01:30:01.146,01:30:02.272,Or how are balancing those equations coming.
01:30:02.314,01:30:04.066,I can't do this.
01:30:04.107,01:30:05.399,Hold on. Hold on.
01:30:05.441,01:30:07.361,"Come on, son."
01:30:07.443,01:30:10.446,Here's a story out of California that's getting national attention.
01:30:10.488,01:30:14.784,The entire boys' basketball team at Richmond High School has been benched.
01:30:14.826,01:30:20.332,"The highly-ranked Oilers have a perfect season on the court, but some players were in big trouble academically."
01:30:20.374,01:30:28.131,"And in an unprecedented move, Coach Ken Carter canceled practice, locked the gym and sent his players straight to the library."
01:30:28.173,01:30:33.595,"Now, at the start of the season, I understand you made all of your players sign a contract before they could join the team."
01:30:33.636,01:30:36.098,What exactly were the conditions of that contract?
01:30:36.139,01:30:45.565,The contract states that the players must maintain a 2.3 grade point average and that the players must attend all their classes and sit in the front row of those classes.
01:30:45.607,01:30:51.029,"Well, Coach Carter, it's an unusual strategy, and a risky one in a sense, in light of your team's winning record."
01:30:51.071,01:30:57.911,But I think there's gonna be a lot of people out there pleased to learn that at least somebody still cares about the concept of a student athlete.
01:30:57.953,01:30:59.371,Thanks a lot for joining us today.
01:31:06.295,01:31:08.797,I'm so sorry to disturb you.
01:31:06.295,01:31:10.506,I'm Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond High School basketball team.
01:31:10.548,01:31:11.591,"Oh, yeah."
01:31:12.384,01:31:13.843,I need to ask you a favor.
01:31:13.885,01:31:20.183,"My team is studying in the library, and I've been trying to tell them that brains and beauty are a perfect combination."
01:31:20.225,01:31:22.644,Know what I'm saying?
01:31:22.685,01:31:24.646,How would you like to watch the Worm work?
01:31:24.687,01:31:26.440,"Hey, where did you get that backpack?"
01:31:26.480,01:31:27.983,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:31:28.024,01:31:33.447,earth science or history or algebra?
01:31:34.739,01:31:41.455,"Getting good grades in those subjects, combined with basketball skills, can get you into college."
01:31:42.331,01:31:43.665,"Girl, you should've bought it."
01:31:43.706,01:31:45.083,I would've worn it.
01:31:55.635,01:31:58.263,You selfish son of a bitch.
01:31:58.305,01:32:00.640,"-Miss-- -No, no."
01:32:00.682,01:32:02.184,"Mr. Carter, you remember me?"
01:32:02.225,01:32:08.273,"Now, after all the things that my son has been through for your team, for you to go and lock up this gym like this, how dare you?"
01:32:24.247,01:32:25.790,the damn gym!
01:32:25.832,01:32:27.334,Let them boys play!
01:32:33.340,01:32:34.508,"What's up, little cousin?"
01:32:35.050,01:32:36.385,How you doing?
01:32:37.511,01:32:38.678,Got something for me?
01:32:40.554,01:32:41.931,That's what I'm talking about.
01:32:52.442,01:32:55.237,"Hey. Hey, hey."
01:32:57.406,01:32:59.199,"-You Coach Carter, right?"
01:32:59.241,01:33:01.701,"-Yeah? Check this out, man."
01:33:01.743,01:33:03.786,-Yeah. How you like that?
01:33:03.828,01:33:04.746,What? What?
01:33:04.787,01:33:06.915,You wanna get out the car?
01:33:06.956,01:33:08.666,-Let's talk about this.
01:33:08.708,01:33:10.460,"Just open up the gym, man."
01:33:13.088,01:33:14.630,"Trust me, you don't want me out this car."
01:33:14.672,01:33:16.925,"Yeah, see? Yeah."
01:33:16.966,01:33:19.553,-Get on!
01:33:19.593,01:33:20.594,"Come on back, punk."
01:33:20.636,01:33:21.846,Dad. Relax.
01:33:21.888,01:33:23.265,"No, I ain't letting nothing go."
01:33:23.306,01:33:26.309,These people in Richmond-- Goddamn it!
01:33:27.102,01:33:28.602,"-Relax, Dad."
01:33:28.644,01:33:31.231,"Relax, relax. Chill out."
01:33:31.273,01:33:35.235,He doesn't mean anything.
01:33:35.277,01:33:36.945,"Come on, get back in the car. Let's go."
01:34:55.898,01:34:58.401,"you know who she is, but she's got a friend."
01:34:58.443,01:35:00.403,"I mean, dog, you gotta hook me up."
01:35:00.445,01:35:01.779,Why I always gotta hook him up?
01:35:01.821,01:35:03.239,Sound like I'm the Love Connection or something.
01:35:03.281,01:35:04.991,"All right, look."
01:35:05.033,01:35:06.159,I'll take care of it.
01:35:06.201,01:35:07.785,-Yeah.
01:35:07.827,01:35:09.538,"You don't remember me, do you? But, see..."
01:35:09.579,01:35:11.623,to duff Duke out.
01:35:11.665,01:35:12.874,Some serious shit.
01:35:12.915,01:35:14.376,"You should have did it, man."
01:35:14.417,01:35:16.085,"You talking all that shit, just do it."
01:35:16.127,01:35:17.546,Know what I'm saying?
01:35:17.587,01:35:19.214,-You let somebody do that to you.
01:35:19.255,01:35:20.674,"Yo, Oscar, man."
01:35:20.714,01:35:22.258,-Don't go nowhere.
01:35:22.300,01:35:23.468,I gotta talk to you about something.
01:35:23.510,01:35:25.011,I already told you...
01:35:25.053,01:35:27.681,-No. You guys is kind of passing...
01:35:27.721,01:35:31.059,But I'm not feeling myself.
01:35:31.100,01:35:34.563,"Hey, I'm gonna holler at my boys across the street for a quick minute."
01:35:34.604,01:35:36.064,"Come on, man."
01:35:36.105,01:35:37.482,-A'ight.
01:35:38.692,01:35:39.775,What do we have here?
01:35:39.817,01:35:42.195,The Three Stooges from Richmond.
01:35:42.237,01:35:43.779,"-Punk, punk, punk."
01:35:43.821,01:35:45.198,-Bitches.
01:35:45.240,01:35:49.869,"I mean, what the hell is the bitchman from Richmond doing on our side of the turf?"
01:35:49.911,01:35:52.163,You garbage.
01:35:52.205,01:35:53.498,"-Shut up, woman."
01:35:53.540,01:35:55.917,I don't understand how y'all won.
01:35:55.958,01:35:57.793,Which one of your mommas was sleeping with the referee?
01:35:57.835,01:35:59.170,Y'all wack-star niggas.
01:35:59.212,01:36:01.005,-Y'all wacked us?
01:36:01.047,01:36:02.716,"Yo, shut your bitch ass up."
01:36:02.756,01:36:04.467,I don't wanna hear you talking that shit anymore.
01:36:04.509,01:36:06.511,"Homey, you a benchwarmer!"
01:36:08.263,01:36:09.681,"Get the hell out my face, whitey!"
01:36:12.684,01:36:14.728,"Let's do it, homey."
01:36:14.768,01:36:16.062,What you trying to do?
01:36:16.104,01:36:17.731,He got a piece.
01:36:17.771,01:36:20.358,"You feel me right now, huh?"
01:36:20.400,01:36:21.526,Y'all brought a gun.
01:36:21.568,01:36:23.403,Feel me?
01:36:23.445,01:36:25.739,"Keep it up the block, homey."
01:36:25.779,01:36:28.116,I'm right here.
01:36:28.157,01:36:30.285,-It's all good.
01:36:32.036,01:36:33.288,Bitch-ass...
01:36:34.080,01:36:35.498,"Pinole, right?"
01:36:36.291,01:36:37.584,Are they serious?
01:36:37.626,01:36:39.001,I'll knock his braids out.
01:36:40.295,01:36:42.088,"Nice to see the fight in you, dog."
01:36:43.339,01:36:44.716,Know what I'm saying?
01:36:44.758,01:36:46.426,-Appreciate the backup.
01:36:48.386,01:36:50.764,"I'm gonna see y'all later, a'ight? All right, homey."
01:36:50.804,01:36:52.432,-Good looking.
01:36:53.767,01:36:55.685,-I'm gonna check y'all.
01:36:55.727,01:36:57.853,"this week, man."
01:36:57.895,01:36:59.813,"This is my paper, man."
01:36:59.855,01:37:01.316,Then why don't you stop getting in my face.
01:37:02.984,01:37:04.193,Huh? You think I'm playing with you?
01:37:06.112,01:37:07.238,Renny!
01:37:16.456,01:37:18.166,Renny!
01:37:25.089,01:37:26.466,"believe this, man."
01:37:26.508,01:37:27.676,He was just standing there.
01:37:30.011,01:37:31.137,Come on. Help me.
01:37:31.179,01:37:32.555,"Call 911, man."
01:37:32.597,01:37:34.307,I need something...
01:37:34.349,01:37:36.058,"to stay with me, okay?"
01:37:39.395,01:37:41.606,Hold him up.
01:37:47.236,01:37:49.698,Ahh! Somebody help me!
01:38:13.722,01:38:14.888,Cruz?
01:38:14.930,01:38:16.932,"-I wanna come back, coach."
01:38:16.974,01:38:18.601,I wanna come back on the team.
01:38:21.145,01:38:22.689,What the hell happened?
01:38:24.273,01:38:25.734,They shot him.
01:38:27.109,01:38:29.028,-What?
01:38:29.779,01:38:32.031,"I mean, we was just there."
01:38:32.073,01:38:34.200,We was just there.
01:38:35.577,01:38:38.747,"Everything was good, coach."
01:38:39.748,01:38:41.290,"Come inside, son."
01:38:41.332,01:38:44.085,-Come on.
01:38:44.126,01:38:46.045,I wanna come back on the team.
01:38:46.087,01:38:47.296,What do I gotta do to play?
01:38:47.338,01:38:49.507,"Don't worry about that, son."
01:38:56.222,01:38:59.893,"Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it, okay?"
01:38:59.933,01:39:01.811,Okay. Okay. Okay.
01:39:02.604,01:39:04.313,-I got you.
01:39:04.355,01:39:06.649,"-Come on, come on, come on."
01:39:06.691,01:39:08.359,they shot him.
01:39:08.401,01:39:10.695,"Just come inside now, all right? Come on."
01:39:10.737,01:39:14.156,on the team!
01:39:14.198,01:39:18.077,"Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it, okay?"
01:39:22.498,01:39:27.503,The state only requires a 2.0 GPA for participation in extracurricular activities.
01:39:27.545,01:39:28.630,"Yes, ma'am."
01:39:28.671,01:39:32.675,"And according to your contract, the players are agreeing to maintain a 2.3?"
01:39:32.717,01:39:34.552,"That, among other things."
01:39:34.594,01:39:35.929,Other things like...
01:39:35.969,01:39:40.683,"Attending all classes, sitting in the front row of those classes, and wearing a tie on game day."
01:39:40.725,01:39:42.518,-I see.
01:39:42.560,01:39:46.522,"Mr. Carter, does the lockout include practices and games?"
01:39:46.564,01:39:48.858,And do you have a set period of time?
01:39:48.900,01:39:50.318,"There will be no basketball, ma'am."
01:39:53.070,01:39:54.906,-Please!
01:39:54.948,01:39:56.783,"Quiet, please!"
01:39:56.825,01:40:01.162,"That includes practices and games, until we as a team reach the agreed-upon GPA."
01:40:02.371,01:40:05.667,"Please, quiet."
01:40:06.167,01:40:07.293,Quiet!
01:40:08.795,01:40:11.172,"Thank you, Mr. Carter."
01:40:08.795,01:40:14.509,"In the interest of time, I'd like to open this board meeting up for comments."
01:40:14.550,01:40:19.180,"As a teacher, I was offended when asked by a coach to provide progress reports."
01:40:19.221,01:40:23.142,Nowhere in my contract does it say that I have to do so.
01:40:23.184,01:40:24.811,It creates more work.
01:40:24.853,01:40:30.274,This lockout has brought negative media attention that questions our abilities as educators.
01:40:30.316,01:40:31.275,End this madness.
01:40:31.317,01:40:33.277,End this lockout.
01:40:36.364,01:40:38.073,I'm Jason Lyle's uncle.
01:40:38.115,01:40:39.701,That boy lives to play ball.
01:40:39.742,01:40:42.035,Comes to school every day now.
01:40:42.077,01:40:46.207,"You take away basketball, God knows what he'd be into."
01:40:47.917,01:40:51.337,"Yesterday, he canceled the Fremont game."
01:40:51.379,01:40:53.840,"Now, that's the biggest game of the year."
01:40:53.882,01:40:55.925,I have scouts coming to watch my boy play.
01:40:57.218,01:40:59.303,These boys are 16-0.
01:40:59.345,01:41:02.682,"This whole school, this whole community, is behind this team."
01:41:06.477,01:41:08.897,Everybody goes to every game.
01:41:08.938,01:41:11.273,Basketball is the only thing that these boys have got.
01:41:11.315,01:41:14.527,"Now, are we gonna let Carter come in here and take that away from them?"
01:41:15.737,01:41:18.990,I don't think so.
01:41:26.121,01:41:27.665,I'd like to make a motion.
01:41:27.707,01:41:29.250,"Yes, Mr. Walters?"
01:41:29.291,01:41:33.546,I move that we remove Mr. Carter as head basketball coach.
01:41:36.507,01:41:39.802,Order.
01:41:39.844,01:41:43.932,This board does not have the authority to terminate employment of a staff position.
01:41:43.973,01:41:47.769,Then I move we end the lockout and let the kids play.
01:41:47.810,01:41:50.438,I second the motion.
01:41:52.231,01:41:54.483,-If I may?
01:41:54.525,01:41:58.905,You really need to consider the message that you're sending these boys.
01:41:58.947,01:42:06.037,"It's the same message that we as a culture send to our pro athletes, which is that they are above the law."
01:42:06.079,01:42:11.626,"Now, I'm trying to teach these boys the discipline that will inform their lives and give them choices."
01:42:11.667,01:42:24.221,"If you endorse the fact that 15, 16 and 17-year-olds don't have to honor the simple rules of a basketball contract, how long do you think it'll be before they're out there breaking laws?"
01:42:24.263,01:42:27.266,"Now, I played basketball at Richmond 30 years ago."
01:42:27.308,01:42:30.103,It was the same thing then.
01:42:30.143,01:42:32.563,Some of my teammates ended up in prison.
01:42:32.605,01:42:34.941,Some of them ended up dead.
01:42:34.983,01:42:43.574,"I took this job because I wanted to effect change in a special group of young men, and this is the only way I know how to do that."
01:42:45.284,01:42:48.955,"If you vote to end the lockout, you won't have to terminate me."
01:42:49.622,01:42:51.290,-I'll quit.
01:42:57.546,01:42:58.631,"Thank you, Mr. Carter."
01:43:02.217,01:43:04.887,The board now recognizes five voting members.
01:43:04.929,01:43:09.266,"In this instance, we will be accepting the vote of Principal Garrison as well."
01:43:09.308,01:43:15.023,"Now, I put to those members the vote on whether or not to end the lockout."
01:43:15.064,01:43:19.443,All those in favor of ending the lockout will raise their right hand when called upon.
01:43:20.903,01:43:24.157,I will vote first by not raising my hand.
01:43:25.908,01:43:27.076,Principal Garrison?
01:43:30.955,01:43:32.247,Thank you.
01:43:32.289,01:43:33.749,Valerie Walker.
01:43:36.209,01:43:37.503,Benson Chiu.
01:43:40.048,01:43:41.757,"Parent rep, Mr. Cepeda."
01:43:44.343,01:43:45.594,And Ms. Nyugen.
01:44:03.863,01:44:05.907,The lockout ends with a vote of 4 to 2.
01:44:06.949,01:44:10.161,"If there's no other business, this board meeting is adjourned."
01:44:11.079,01:44:12.371,Thank you all for coming.
01:44:31.974,01:44:33.392,Are you sure you wanna do this?
01:44:36.604,01:44:48.241,"Look, I know we haven't always seen eye to eye, but you've done such a great job with these boys, it seems wrong to just-- Look. No offense, ma'am, but all the work I did with those boys was negated when they ended the lockout."
01:44:48.281,01:44:49.533,I don't think that's true.
01:44:48.281,01:44:51.786,I really-- The board sent the message loud and clear.
01:44:51.827,01:44:56.624,Winning basketball games is more important than graduating from high school and going to college.
01:44:56.665,01:44:59.627,I'm sorry. I just can't support that message.
01:45:02.588,01:45:52.180,"I remember was Juicy Me and my moms I played it for him Sir, they can cut the chain off the door, but they can't make us play."
01:45:55.141,01:46:00.479,"We've decided we're gonna finish what you started, sir."
01:46:00.521,01:46:02.648,"so leave us be, coach."
01:46:02.690,01:46:04.275,"We got shit to do, sir."
01:46:17.788,01:46:20.291,Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
01:46:20.333,01:46:24.419,Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
01:46:24.461,01:46:28.341,"It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us."
01:46:28.381,01:46:30.259,Your playing small does not serve the world.
01:46:30.301,01:46:35.890,There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
01:46:35.931,01:46:37.933,"We were all meant to shine, as children do."
01:46:39.185,01:46:41.478,"It's not just in some of us, it's in everyone."
01:46:42.521,01:46:47.985,"And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same."
01:46:48.027,01:46:53.824,"As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."
01:47:00.539,01:47:02.333,"Sir, I just wanna say thank you."
01:47:05.378,01:47:06.712,You saved my life.
01:47:15.846,01:47:17.472,"Thank you, sirs."
01:47:20.559,01:47:21.685,All of you.
01:47:43.958,01:47:45.084,Whoo!
01:48:05.478,01:48:08.065,"Academic-progress reports, young men."
01:48:09.191,01:48:10.859,These things are...
01:48:12.445,01:48:14.196,unbelievable.
01:48:15.114,01:48:17.032,I know you've been trying.
01:48:20.035,01:48:22.037,I guess there's only one way to say this.
01:48:24.832,01:48:27.500,"Gentlemen, we've reached our goal."
01:48:32.714,01:48:33.841,Rich what?
01:48:33.882,01:48:34.758,Richmond!

01:48:41.349,01:48:42.266,Richmond!
01:48:42.308,01:48:43.267,Rich what?
01:48:43.725,01:48:44.810,Richmond!
01:48:44.852,01:48:46.020,Rich what?
01:48:46.061,01:48:47.271,Richmond!
01:48:47.313,01:48:48.521,Rich what?
01:48:48.563,01:48:49.648,Richmond!

01:48:55.321,01:48:56.405,Richmond!
01:48:56.447,01:48:57.530,Rich what?
01:48:57.572,01:48:58.657,Richmond!
01:49:06.499,01:49:08.334,"Get back, get back, get back."
01:49:10.002,01:49:12.046,"Set it, Worm. Set it."
01:49:12.087,01:49:13.172,Watch baseline.
01:49:15.548,01:49:16.925,"Take it, come on."
01:49:19.512,01:49:22.264,-Yes!
01:49:23.516,01:49:25.393,"Go, go, go!"
01:49:25.434,01:49:26.852,"Swing it, swing it."

01:49:47.789,01:49:50.667,"Hold the ball! Hold the ball, hold the ball, hold the ball!"
01:49:53.462,01:50:02.012,"eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, see ya!"
01:50:09.644,01:50:10.603,"Great game, coach."
01:50:10.645,01:50:11.772,Good game.
01:50:14.607,01:50:15.984,Rich what?
01:50:16.026,01:50:20.739,Richmond returns from their lockout and keeps their streak alive at 17 games.
01:50:20.781,01:50:30.332,A team that won only four games last year is now a Cinderella team that has to be thinking that there's a chance of getting the phone call to come to the dance.
01:50:30.374,01:50:33.127,Is Richmond headed for the state tournament?
01:50:45.264,01:50:47.808,y'all gonna do at the park when you go?
01:50:47.849,01:50:49.393,-Seesaw.
01:50:50.060,01:50:51.395,You're gonna seesaw?
01:50:51.437,01:50:53.021,-Who's gonna push you?
01:50:53.063,01:50:54.440,gonna push me.
01:50:56.900,01:50:58.152,That's good.
01:50:58.193,01:50:59.403,I wish I could go with you.
01:50:59.445,01:51:00.571,"Come on, baby."
01:51:00.613,01:51:02.615,"But I'll see you later, okay?"
01:51:10.539,01:51:11.706,How you been?
01:51:13.750,01:51:14.793,Good.
01:51:16.170,01:51:17.463,You look good.
01:51:18.464,01:51:19.923,Thank you.
01:51:19.965,01:51:22.843,So do you.
01:51:28.307,01:51:31.268,"You know, everything's been crazy, with the lockout."
01:51:32.102,01:51:33.604,"Yeah, it'll be all right."
01:51:34.605,01:51:35.688,For sure.
01:51:36.565,01:51:38.400,Can we sit down somewhere?
01:51:58.671,01:52:02.675,I've been trying to get my head straight about things.
01:52:02.715,01:52:05.219,A lot of things.
01:52:05.260,01:52:07.720,"-Kenny, I don't know-- -Kyra, just listen."
01:52:08.763,01:52:10.307,Please.
01:52:12.476,01:52:17.772,"For a long time, it's just been my moms, my boys, and you."
01:52:17.814,01:52:19.900,And that's what I counted on.
01:52:19.941,01:52:27.408,"I'm trying to count on myself now, and I'm all right and shit, it's just, without you, nothing good feels as good."
01:52:28.325,01:52:30.160,It's like...
01:52:30.202,01:52:31.953,I'm missing some happy part of me.
01:52:44.258,01:52:45.593,I got you something.
01:52:48.136,01:52:50.055,And it ain't from the 99 Cent Store.
01:52:52.099,01:52:53.308,Shut up.
01:52:58.021,01:52:59.273,They gave you a scholarship?
01:52:59.314,01:53:00.773,"Yeah, baby, a full ride."
01:53:00.815,01:53:04.319,"Oh, my gosh."
01:53:05.279,01:53:07.822,"Oh, my gosh."
01:53:07.864,01:53:09.782,I know you gonna kill it up there.
01:53:09.824,01:53:12.453,"No, we gonna kill it up there."
01:53:12.494,01:53:14.663,I told them about you and the baby.
01:53:27.050,01:53:28.469,Kenyon...
01:53:29.553,01:53:31.680,There is no more baby.
01:53:35.559,01:53:37.436,I decided not to go through with it.
01:53:39.647,01:53:40.981,Kyra.
01:53:42.483,01:53:46.654,"I had a choice to make, so I made it."
01:53:48.029,01:53:49.448,"For me, Kenny."
01:53:53.160,01:53:54.620,"Well... well, when do..."
01:53:56.705,01:53:58.791,Why didn't you tell me?
01:54:04.837,01:54:06.214,I'm so sorry.
01:54:07.675,01:54:10.636,"Kyra, I'm so sorry you had to go through that by yourself."
01:54:13.514,01:54:14.889,My mom went with me.
01:54:17.768,01:54:19.478,"But I think that, um..."
01:54:19.520,01:54:24.483,I think you should go to school and play ball and do your thing.
01:54:25.400,01:54:27.194,You know?
01:54:27.235,01:54:30.280,I want that for you.
01:54:31.740,01:54:33.492,I think you should be all you can.
01:54:35.994,01:54:37.371,I want you to come with me.
01:54:41.124,01:54:42.751,"Kyra, I love you."
01:54:43.711,01:54:45.337,I want you to come with me.
01:54:46.672,01:54:47.881,You serious?
01:54:47.922,01:54:49.216,I'm serious.
01:54:49.675,01:54:50.843,"Oh, my God."
01:54:50.884,01:54:52.052,I love you.
01:54:52.093,01:54:53.345,"I love you, too."
01:55:02.312,01:55:03.564,Ken Carter.
01:55:05.774,01:55:06.900,"I understand, sir."
01:55:08.902,01:55:10.362,All right.
01:55:18.953,01:55:20.455,We're in.
01:55:22.708,01:55:24.167,That's what I'm talking about.
01:55:31.091,01:55:33.968,"Guys, guys, guys."
01:55:34.010,01:55:36.430,It's not gonna be easy.
01:55:37.097,01:55:38.932,We're a really low seed.
01:55:38.973,01:55:40.225,"Who did we get, coach?"
01:55:41.935,01:55:43.103,St. Francis.
01:55:45.647,01:55:47.858,"Coach, they ranked number one in the state."
01:55:51.528,01:55:52.738,"don't worry about Ty Crane, dog."
01:55:53.321,01:55:54.865,We got this.
01:55:54.907,01:55:56.909,"That's all right, baby."
01:55:56.950,01:55:58.619,"-All right, guys."
01:56:08.002,01:56:10.839,"-Bring your A game, young man."
01:56:42.621,01:56:46.875,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first round of the CIF playoffs."
01:56:46.917,01:56:55.383,"St. Francis is one of the best high school teams in the nation, with Ty Crane believed to be a shoo-in for the top NBA draft pick next year."
01:56:55.425,01:57:00.931,"On the other side of the court is Richmond, a team that's had a media-worthy season as well."
01:57:00.973,01:57:03.934,Richmond High has never played in a state tournament.
01:57:03.976,01:57:05.352,Let's go.
01:57:05.393,01:57:06.770,"Let's go, let's go."
01:57:12.526,01:57:13.694,settle down.
01:57:13.735,01:57:14.862,1-4!
01:57:25.789,01:57:26.832,"Good shot, baby."
01:57:27.207,01:57:28.750,"Oh, yeah."
01:57:28.792,01:57:30.168,"Get back, get back."
01:57:30.210,01:57:31.628,Run motion. Run motion.
01:57:33.046,01:57:36.925,Defense! Defense!
01:57:36.967,01:57:38.218,right here.
01:57:38.259,01:57:39.344,Swing it.
01:57:42.055,01:57:43.515,Force him left.
01:57:49.563,01:57:50.647,You gotta force him left.
01:57:50.689,01:57:52.190,The baselines are not being defended.
01:58:02.409,01:58:03.493,You better get somebody else to hold me.
01:58:03.535,01:58:04.745,I'm dropping 50 tonight.
01:58:06.538,01:58:07.706,Set up!
01:58:11.585,01:58:14.254,SECOND QUARTER get on him.
01:58:15.881,01:58:17.007,Get over here and help.
01:58:17.049,01:58:18.299,Yeah!
01:58:22.470,01:58:24.138,"Find your man, find your man."
01:58:24.180,01:58:26.474,"Now, watch out."
01:58:26.516,01:58:28.560,Watch the trap.
01:58:28.602,01:58:29.937,That's the one.
01:58:32.188,01:58:34.482,That's it. Yes! Yes!
01:58:34.524,01:58:36.192,S-C-O-R-E!
01:58:36.234,01:58:37.736,Score! Score!
01:58:40.280,01:58:41.740,"Ball, ball. Ball, man!"
01:58:50.415,01:58:51.833,Less talk out there.
01:58:51.875,01:59:04.596,"THIRD QUARTER Come on, come on, come on, come on."
01:59:04.638,01:59:06.222,"Let's go, Richmond!"
01:59:06.264,01:59:08.141,You gotta help Junior on the weak-side pick.
01:59:10.477,01:59:11.812,Let it go.
01:59:13.939,01:59:15.315,Delilah! Delilah!
01:59:18.318,01:59:20.403,-Defense! Defense!
01:59:20.445,01:59:21.947,Delilah! Delilah!
01:59:23.698,01:59:24.783,"Get there, get there."
01:59:24.825,01:59:26.200,"Trap, trap, trap."
01:59:39.047,01:59:40.841,"-Use the pick, use the pick."
01:59:44.719,01:59:46.429,That's what I'm talking about.
01:59:47.639,01:59:49.390,-Huddle up.
01:59:49.432,01:59:50.684,"Mustangs, bring it in."
01:59:50.725,01:59:53.145,-Damn!
01:59:53.186,01:59:54.228,"Timeout, sir. Time."
01:59:54.270,01:59:55.647,"-Come here, come here!"
01:59:56.815,01:59:57.858,Damn it!
01:59:59.442,02:00:01.069,keep up the defense!
02:00:02.403,02:00:03.613,"Come on, what you gonna do?"
02:00:04.906,02:00:06.574,"Come on, fellas."
02:00:08.576,02:00:11.746,"Gentlemen, you told me you deserved to be here."
02:00:11.788,02:00:13.748,"Well, you're not playing like it."
02:00:13.790,02:00:16.793,"All season long, we played our game."
02:00:16.835,02:00:19.171,"Right now, you're playing theirs."
02:00:19.212,02:00:25.593,"When we step on the floor, every second that clock is ticking, we are pedal to the metal."
02:00:25.635,02:00:28.429,We run the ball.
02:00:28.471,02:00:33.852,"And most importantly, we control the tempo of the game!"
02:00:33.894,02:00:37.772,We make them play Richmond Oiler ball.
02:00:38.815,02:00:40.775,"Worm, you can take this kid."
02:00:40.817,02:00:44.029,"Force him left, and when he crosses over, you jump him."
02:00:44.071,02:00:46.114,"Damien, push the tempo."
02:00:46.156,02:00:48.533,"Kenyon, Lyle, crash the boards."
02:00:48.575,02:00:52.579,"Cruz, when you're in the game in transition, take that jumper you love."
02:00:52.620,02:00:55.165,"Junior, just keep doing what you're doing."
02:00:55.207,02:00:57.167,Hold on to that monster.
02:00:57.209,02:01:03.798,"You do those things, gentlemen, and I guarantee you, at the end of the game, we will be there."
02:01:07.135,02:01:08.344,"All right, hands in."
02:01:10.597,02:01:12.348,"All right, take control of this game."
02:01:12.390,02:01:13.683,Who's gonna win this game?
02:01:13.725,02:01:14.935,"-One, two, three."
02:01:14.976,02:01:16.061,Let's go.
02:01:16.103,02:01:17.812,-Let's do this.
02:01:21.357,02:01:22.901,"One, two, three, Mustangs!"
02:01:32.577,02:01:33.870,"Go, go, go."
02:01:34.412,02:01:35.580,Cut.
02:01:37.331,02:01:39.417,Whoo! Yeah!
02:01:42.045,02:01:43.088,Yes!
02:01:43.130,02:01:49.136,"FOURTH QUARTER That's the only damn one, huh? What?"
02:01:49.177,02:01:50.762,"How you gonna call that on me, ref?"
02:01:50.804,02:01:51.888,"Good call, ref."
02:01:53.098,02:01:55.475,Cruz. In for Kenyon.
02:01:58.186,02:01:59.437,"ball, ball."
02:01:59.479,02:02:01.189,"Run it, run it, run it."
02:02:15.578,02:02:18.206,Everybody get back!
02:02:18.248,02:02:20.583,Yeah! Come on! Whoo!
02:02:34.639,02:02:35.723,Damn.

02:02:51.572,02:02:53.116,"Ref, you gotta call that."
02:02:53.158,02:02:54.242,"Push, push."
02:02:54.284,02:02:55.368,Can we get a call?
02:03:03.835,02:03:05.962,"Take care of the ball, man."
02:03:12.260,02:03:13.594,Yeah!
02:03:16.097,02:03:18.099,"Get back, get back."
02:03:22.562,02:03:23.437,I got it.
02:03:30.111,02:03:30.945,Yeah.
02:03:31.654,02:03:32.572,"Go get 'em, boys."
02:03:34.199,02:03:35.950,"Charge, number 30."
02:03:35.992,02:03:37.118,Red ball.
02:03:37.160,02:03:38.494,"Come on, ref, you wasn't even there."
02:03:44.876,02:03:47.128,"Red ball, red ball."
02:03:47.170,02:03:48.421,Yes. Yes.
02:03:48.462,02:03:49.881,-Richmond's ball.
02:03:49.923,02:03:51.216,"Okay, let's go."
