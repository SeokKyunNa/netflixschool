00:01:18.412,00:01:20.622,Hey! Aah!
00:01:51.528,00:01:55.198,I got those concert tickets you wanted.
00:01:57.701,00:02:01.496,"For Friday night? Stanley, this is great."
00:02:02.539,00:02:04.207,"So, what time should I pick you up?"
00:02:04.875,00:02:06.209,"Well, see, here's the thing."
00:02:06.376,00:02:10.047,My very best friend just came into town and I know she would die to go to this.
00:02:10.213,00:02:12.215,So could we maybe get an extra ticket for her?
00:02:12.382,00:02:14.009,Ooh.
00:02:14.551,00:02:18.221,They're out. They're sold out. That means there's no more.
00:02:19.056,00:02:20.057,Oh.
00:02:20.223,00:02:22.476,"Well, I just can't let her sit home all alone."
00:02:24.019,00:02:28.065,"Look, I'll tell you what. Why don't you just go with your friend?"
00:02:30.108,00:02:31.652,"Stanley, I couldn't do that."
00:02:31.818,00:02:33.070,"No, come on."
00:02:34.613,00:02:36.740,"Stanley, you are the nicest guy."
00:02:36.948,00:02:38.408,"-Ahh. -Really, you are."
00:02:38.575,00:02:39.910,-Yeah? -Charlie...
00:02:40.077,00:02:41.578,...isn't Stanley the nicest guy?
00:02:41.745,00:02:42.954,The best.
00:02:46.750,00:02:51.588,That was the most sickening display I've ever seen.
00:02:51.755,00:02:54.841,I disagree. I think I'm wearing her down.
00:02:55.008,00:02:58.220,"Buddy, you know what you need? You need a little change of pace."
00:02:58.387,00:03:01.180,"Tonight, I'm gonna take you on a love safari..."
00:03:01.348,00:03:04.726,...deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle.
00:03:04.893,00:03:06.770,"Tell me more, bwana."
00:03:06.937,00:03:10.649,The Coco Bongo Club. Hottest new joint in town.
00:03:10.816,00:03:14.152,Only the crème de la crème need apply.
00:03:14.695,00:03:16.571,-So how do we get in? -Are you kidding?
00:03:16.738,00:03:19.032,"-Leave it to me. Trust me, buddy... -Yeah."
00:03:19.198,00:03:23.704,...this is going to be the perfect night on the town.
00:03:29.126,00:03:32.295,MAN 1: I don't have my umbrella. MAN 2: Hurry.
00:03:36.717,00:03:41.638,Hold the phone. Killer at 3 o'clock.
00:04:10.041,00:04:13.670,Stand back and observe.
00:04:16.798,00:04:18.258,TINA: Where can I open a new account?
00:04:18.425,00:04:20.135,"New accounts, right here."
00:04:20.302,00:04:26.683,"You're lucky you caught me, I was on my way out to-- -Could you hold this for me, please? -I will hold anything you want."
00:04:26.850,00:04:28.351,Thank you.
00:04:29.269,00:04:31.229,Can you help me?
00:04:56.546,00:04:58.048,So.
00:04:58.882,00:05:01.134,What kind of account do you have in mind?
00:05:01.301,00:05:02.385,I'm not sure exactly.
00:05:02.552,00:05:06.389,"You see, I'm just terrible with things like that."
00:05:06.640,00:05:11.394,"-That's an interesting tie, Mr...? -Ipkiss, Stanley Ipkiss."
00:05:11.561,00:05:15.232,-Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet you. -The pleasure's all mine.
00:05:15.565,00:05:16.858,May I?
00:05:17.734,00:05:20.237,-May you what? -I'm such a mess.
00:05:21.071,00:05:24.241,"-Oh, of course. -Thanks."
00:05:24.407,00:05:25.408,That's what they're there for.
00:05:28.912,00:05:35.585,"As I was saying about that tie, it kind of reminds me of one of those-- What do you call it? Um, inkblot tests."
00:05:35.752,00:05:38.588,-A Rorschach test. -Right.
00:05:38.755,00:05:41.091,"You know, it sort of looks like..."
00:05:42.092,00:05:43.760,...a young woman riding bareback.
00:05:44.427,00:05:47.514,Sort of a Lady Godiva or something.
00:05:48.932,00:05:50.392,Of course.
00:05:50.559,00:05:53.937,"What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?"
00:05:54.437,00:05:58.024,Um-- I-- I don't know.
00:06:07.284,00:06:08.785,"Oh, oh."
00:06:09.286,00:06:11.955,Uh-- It-- Bright colors.
00:06:12.122,00:06:17.294,It's-- It's a power tie. It's supposed to make you feel powerful.
00:06:17.794,00:06:19.087,Does it work?
00:06:23.758,00:06:27.846,"Now, how about that account, huh?"
00:06:28.013,00:06:31.057,We have several different plans. Savings.
00:06:36.771,00:06:37.814,Checking.
00:06:37.981,00:06:43.194,"Savings and checking, CDs, savings and CDs, checking and CDs..."
00:06:43.361,00:06:46.114,"...savings, checking and CDs, T-bills."
00:06:46.281,00:06:49.075,Or we could just take all your money and throw it in a big mattress back there.
00:06:54.664,00:06:57.250,"STANLEY: Now, I have some forms you'll have to fill out."
00:07:03.632,00:07:04.716,"MAN 2: That's it, sweetheart."
00:07:04.883,00:07:09.095,"Now, just a little bit to the right. Beautiful."
00:07:09.262,00:07:12.098,"Hey, will you guys keep it down back there?"
00:07:12.724,00:07:13.850,No problem.
00:07:14.351,00:07:16.561,"-So, what do you think? -Layout's not bad."
00:07:16.728,00:07:20.023,But them motion detectors are a pain in the ass.
00:07:20.565,00:07:25.362,"-But you can pull this off, right? -Hey, you talking to the doctor."
00:07:25.528,00:07:27.364,I do have one question.
00:07:28.239,00:07:29.282,Which is?
00:07:29.824,00:07:31.868,What does Niko have to say about all this?
00:07:32.369,00:07:34.037,Nothing.
00:07:34.579,00:07:35.830,"This ain't his grift, man."
00:07:35.997,00:07:39.334,"Get real, man. Everything is his grift."
00:07:39.501,00:07:43.672,"He owns you, he owns this club, he owns this whole stinking town."
00:07:44.547,00:07:46.549,Things change.
00:07:47.217,00:07:51.805,"You mess with Niko, you end up taking a dirt nap."
00:07:52.639,00:07:55.183,DORIAN: He's the only one who's napping.
00:07:57.060,00:07:59.688,And I'm about to give him a serious wake-up call.
00:08:00.647,00:08:01.898,But we need some cash.
00:08:02.482,00:08:05.735,"So first we take the bank, then we take Niko..."
00:08:05.902,00:08:09.072,"...and then, my friend, school is out."
00:08:09.364,00:08:11.908,And this whole city is our playground.
00:08:18.623,00:08:20.208,"MAN: Hey, bub, watch where you're going."
00:08:30.301,00:08:31.761,Hello?
00:08:35.598,00:08:38.059,"-Hello? MAN: Hang on, hang on."
00:08:39.227,00:08:41.271,"Don't get your panties in a twist, would you?"
00:08:41.438,00:08:43.523,"Hey, Burt, what the hell is this?"
00:08:43.690,00:08:47.485,"Oh, I don't know. Uh-- About 700 bucks, Irv."
00:08:49.654,00:08:51.948,"Now, what can I do for you, bub?"
00:08:52.115,00:08:54.034,I'm here for the Civic.
00:08:54.451,00:08:57.912,"The brake drums are shot, and you need a new transmission."
00:08:58.079,00:08:59.622,What?
00:08:59.789,00:09:01.791,All I wanted was an oil change.
00:09:01.958,00:09:06.046,You're lucky you caught these problems before they cause you some serious trouble.
00:09:06.212,00:09:10.467,Ahem. Sign right here and press down hard.
00:09:11.176,00:09:13.720,-There's no price. -There will be.
00:09:14.763,00:09:17.265,I don't have a car. I have to have a car tonight.
00:09:17.974,00:09:19.476,-Irv. -Yo.
00:09:19.642,00:09:21.770,Bring around the loaner.
00:09:22.645,00:09:23.646,The loaner?
00:09:24.189,00:09:26.024,The loaner?
00:09:52.842,00:09:54.385,WOMEN: Eww.
00:09:55.136,00:09:56.721,It's a classic.
00:10:04.771,00:10:08.024,-Hi. Charlie. -Stanley.
00:10:08.191,00:10:10.902,"Gals, I want you to meet my buddy Stanley Ipkiss."
00:10:11.069,00:10:12.779,Humongo in the banking business.
00:10:14.364,00:10:15.365,Not really.
00:10:15.532,00:10:18.076,"Hey, what do you say we get in this joint, huh?"
00:10:19.202,00:10:23.456,"Yo, Bobby. How you doing, buddy? It's Charlie."
00:10:23.623,00:10:25.500,"-Charlie, how you doing? -How are you?"
00:10:25.667,00:10:27.377,-How you doing? -Long time no see.
00:10:27.544,00:10:29.796,"-Come on in. -Hey, good to see you. Okay, then."
00:10:29.963,00:10:31.714,"Come on, gals, let's get going."
00:10:32.257,00:10:33.842,See you on the inside. Oh!
00:10:35.802,00:10:38.388,Bobby? Charlie. Charlie!
00:10:39.806,00:10:41.474,Charlie!
00:10:43.059,00:10:45.728,-It's a mistake. -You can't do that.
00:10:45.895,00:10:47.564,"-Hey, hey. -Whoa!"
00:10:47.939,00:10:50.942,You crossed the rope. Never cross the rope.
00:10:51.109,00:10:54.320,"But my friends are on the inside-- -Lose him. STANLEY: Come on now, guys."
00:10:54.487,00:10:57.407,"Now this isn't fair. Hey, watch it, I'm a bleeder."
00:10:57.740,00:11:00.743,"You put me down right now, or I am never coming back here."
00:11:04.247,00:11:05.874,Thanks.
00:11:11.087,00:11:12.797,"Aw, jeez."
00:11:26.853,00:11:31.065,"-Mr. Ipkiss, hi. -Hi."
00:11:32.483,00:11:33.776,Are you okay?
00:11:34.110,00:11:35.320,Me?
00:11:35.486,00:11:37.780,I'm great. Really good.
00:11:37.947,00:11:40.074,"I just-- I never felt better, really."
00:11:40.241,00:11:43.620,I'm just catching some air out here. Whew.
00:11:43.786,00:11:45.288,"Your car, sir."
00:11:46.705,00:11:47.874,That's not my car.
00:11:48.333,00:11:49.542,MAN: But it matches the ticket.
00:11:53.463,00:11:54.964,All right.
00:11:55.131,00:11:56.841,I'll take it.
00:11:58.301,00:12:01.596,But I am very angry.
00:12:02.472,00:12:03.514,You believe this?
00:12:05.391,00:12:07.852,You drive in in a Porsche....
00:12:38.800,00:12:40.218,Oh.
00:12:40.385,00:12:42.011,Jeez!
00:12:42.845,00:12:44.305,Oh!
00:13:01.990,00:13:04.534,Uhn! God.
00:13:12.709,00:13:13.751,Ah!
00:13:47.826,00:13:49.370,Hey!
00:13:51.873,00:13:53.832,"Hey, mister!"
00:13:56.627,00:13:58.421,Hold on!
00:13:59.047,00:14:01.132,I know CPR.
00:14:39.212,00:14:40.254,"MAN: Hey, you."
00:14:41.631,00:14:42.882,What are you doing down there?
00:14:43.466,00:14:47.678,Uh.... I'm just looking for...
00:14:48.846,00:14:50.807,...my mask.
00:14:51.682,00:14:53.476,I got it.
00:15:02.151,00:15:05.655,Ipkiss. Do you have any idea what time it is?
00:15:06.322,00:15:07.490,"Actually, no."
00:15:09.575,00:15:11.661,My new carpet.
00:15:11.828,00:15:16.499,"Well, this is coming right out of your security deposit, Ipkiss."
00:15:16.916,00:15:19.001,"-You know, Mrs. Peenman-- -What?"
00:15:22.880,00:15:23.923,Nothing.
00:15:24.090,00:15:28.177,"Well, that's what you are, Ipkiss, a big nothing."
00:15:31.514,00:15:35.351,Aren't you due back at the laboratory to get your bolts tightened?
00:15:37.145,00:15:39.063,I should've said that.
00:15:46.737,00:15:50.533,"Hey, you. Milo."
00:15:50.700,00:15:54.537,You know you're not supposed to jump up. It's against doggy ordinance.
00:16:02.837,00:16:04.130,Okay.
00:16:19.395,00:16:22.565,What do you want? You want me to throw that?
00:16:22.732,00:16:24.150,I'm very tired.
00:16:24.317,00:16:27.111,"Okay, I'll throw it one time."
00:16:27.278,00:16:29.572,I ain't gonna throw it with you attached to it.
00:16:29.739,00:16:31.240,Ow!
00:16:33.868,00:16:35.703,You ready? Get it.
00:16:37.205,00:16:40.666,"PEENMAN: Ipkiss, turn down those cartoons."
00:16:40.833,00:16:43.961,"All right, Mrs. Peenman."
00:16:49.008,00:16:52.261,"So, Dr. Neuman, you're saying that everybody wears a mask?"
00:16:52.428,00:16:53.846,"That's correct, Wendy."
00:16:54.013,00:16:56.933,"We all wear masks, metaphorically speaking."
00:16:57.099,00:16:59.936,"We suppress the id, our darkest desires..."
00:17:00.102,00:17:03.022,...and adopt a more socially acceptable image.
00:17:03.439,00:17:04.899,"Well, the book is, of course..."
00:17:05.066,00:17:07.109,"...The Masks We Wear, by Dr. Arthur Neuman."
00:17:07.276,00:17:09.195,Thank you so much for being with us today.
00:17:13.866,00:17:17.245,What's the matter with you? What is it?
00:17:18.287,00:17:20.081,"What are you looking for, huh?"
00:17:20.248,00:17:23.417,You like this thing? You like it?
00:17:24.627,00:17:27.296,The Masks We Wear.
00:17:31.509,00:17:35.471,"We all wear masks, metaphorically speaking."
00:17:43.354,00:17:45.439,"Yeah, right."
00:18:24.103,00:18:27.732,Smoking.
00:18:29.400,00:18:31.527,It's party time.
00:18:31.694,00:18:36.532,P-A-R-T-- Why? Because I gotta.
00:18:48.127,00:18:49.629,Shh.
00:19:01.766,00:19:03.225,Ahh.
00:19:16.906,00:19:19.575,Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:19:46.477,00:19:51.440,"Look, Ma, I'm roadkill. Ha-ha-ha!"
00:19:54.360,00:19:55.403,Pbbb-bbb-bbb!
00:19:59.532,00:20:00.658,"DRIVER: Hey, get out of the road."
00:20:00.825,00:20:02.743,I think he wants to communicate.
00:20:23.556,00:20:26.559,"Hey, mister. You got the time?"
00:20:26.726,00:20:29.645,"As a matter of fact, I do, cubby."
00:20:30.771,00:20:32.606,MAN 1: You wanna take him? MAN 2: I got him.
00:20:33.983,00:20:36.736,Look at that. It's exactly two seconds before I honk your nose...
00:20:36.902,00:20:38.821,...and pull your underwear over your head.
00:20:45.494,00:20:46.662,Come on.
00:20:46.829,00:20:48.164,MAN 3: He's dead. MAN 4: Kill him.
00:20:48.330,00:20:49.665,"-Come on, take him. MAN 3: Get him."
00:20:53.919,00:20:57.006,"Step right up here, don't be shy."
00:20:57.173,00:21:00.676,Nobody likes a bashful leatherhead.
00:21:00.843,00:21:02.344,Move it!
00:21:02.511,00:21:07.683,"For my first trick, I'd like to do something for you, son."
00:21:10.811,00:21:12.772,We have a giraffe.
00:21:12.938,00:21:15.191,"There you go. Now get out of here, you bother me."
00:21:15.357,00:21:17.359,-Thanks. -Wow.
00:21:17.526,00:21:19.320,Now....
00:21:20.362,00:21:22.698,"-Sorry, wrong pocket. WOMAN: Ha-ha-ha."
00:21:22.865,00:21:24.533,"For you, son..."
00:21:25.117,00:21:26.702,...a little body English.
00:21:30.539,00:21:33.000,A French poodle.
00:21:35.127,00:21:37.797,"Sorry, son, the dog was rabid. Had to put it down."
00:21:37.963,00:21:41.509,"And last but not least, my favorite."
00:21:53.312,00:21:55.147,A Tommy gun.
00:21:56.607,00:21:58.275,Run!
00:22:07.451,00:22:09.328,This is incredible.
00:22:09.495,00:22:12.915,"With these powers, I could be..."
00:22:14.875,00:22:16.961,...a superhero.
00:22:17.127,00:22:22.842,"I could fight crime, protect the innocent, work for world peace."
00:22:23.008,00:22:25.052,But first....
00:22:33.894,00:22:37.565,...it's time for an overhaul.
00:23:03.966,00:23:05.676,Oh.
00:23:23.485,00:23:24.820,It was a dream.
00:23:27.239,00:23:29.491,It was a dream.
00:23:33.329,00:23:34.914,I gotta lay off the cartoons.
00:23:43.380,00:23:46.300,-Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss? -Yes.
00:23:46.467,00:23:48.344,"Lieutenant Kellaway, City Precinct."
00:23:48.510,00:23:51.639,Do you know anything about the disturbance last night?
00:23:52.097,00:23:54.183,Disturbance?
00:23:54.350,00:23:57.478,"Yeah, some kind of prowler broke in and attacked Mrs. Peenman."
00:23:59.188,00:24:00.481,You didn't hear anything?
00:24:00.648,00:24:03.192,She unloaded a couple of rounds of 20-ought buckshot...
00:24:03.359,00:24:05.110,...five feet from your door.
00:24:05.277,00:24:07.196,PEENMAN: Look at the floor. See that?
00:24:07.363,00:24:11.033,"He put that right in my floor, then he jumped out the window, officer!"
00:24:11.200,00:24:13.494,COP: Jumped out the window? PEENMAN: Are you writing notes?
00:24:16.622,00:24:19.375,Those pajamas are impossible. This actually happened.
00:24:21.043,00:24:24.380,"See, I have an inner-ear problem."
00:24:26.924,00:24:29.551,-Sometimes I can't hear anything. -That a fact?
00:24:29.718,00:24:32.596,Eh? Heh-heh-heh.
00:24:32.763,00:24:33.806,Here's my card.
00:24:33.973,00:24:37.226,If you remember anything unusual about last night...
00:24:37.393,00:24:39.979,"...anything at all, call me."
00:24:40.145,00:24:41.563,You betcha. Thank you.
00:24:41.730,00:24:44.233,"And good luck, uh..."
00:24:44.900,00:24:46.235,...cracking the case.
00:24:59.540,00:25:01.917,"Oh, my God, I'm late."
00:25:03.252,00:25:05.170,"Keys, keys."
00:25:05.337,00:25:07.589,Where's the keys?
00:25:08.382,00:25:09.925,Damn.
00:25:10.508,00:25:12.261,Milo. Get the keys.
00:25:12.428,00:25:13.595,Get them. Find them.
00:25:17.349,00:25:18.851,Get the keys.
00:25:24.606,00:25:26.275,Ow! Jeez!
00:25:26.817,00:25:29.445,I am so late.
00:25:31.363,00:25:34.700,"Good boy. Good boy. Thattaboy. Come on, boy."
00:25:34.867,00:25:36.702,Give them to me. Drop it.
00:26:08.233,00:26:11.320,-I want a proctologist standing by. DISPATCHER: What?
00:26:11.487,00:26:13.489,You heard me. The best one you can find.
00:26:13.906,00:26:16.533,I'm with The Evening Star. Can you tell me what happened?
00:26:16.700,00:26:17.868,"No, and you can quote me."
00:26:18.035,00:26:20.162,"Well, it looks like some sort of mob tactic."
00:26:20.329,00:26:22.081,"There it is, boys. She broke the case."
00:26:22.247,00:26:24.208,"Come on, get these rubbernecks out of here."
00:26:24.374,00:26:30.214,"-Let's go. WOMAN: Wait, there's no-- MAN: Officer, please-- WOMAN: Can you tell us, sir, please?"
00:26:31.757,00:26:34.718,"Hey, Stan. Stan, Stan. Where were you last night?"
00:26:34.885,00:26:37.179,The girls and I were looking all over for you.
00:26:37.346,00:26:39.848,Did you happen to look outside in the gutter?
00:26:40.015,00:26:41.934,"Hey, did you check the morning paper?"
00:26:42.101,00:26:43.852,Your girlfriend got a great review.
00:26:45.354,00:26:48.857,"Ipkiss, you're 40 minutes late. Now, that's the same as stealing."
00:26:49.024,00:26:51.360,"I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'll never happen again."
00:26:51.527,00:26:53.654,I've been a jerk.
00:26:53.821,00:26:56.406,"Well, if you weren't busy ogling girlie pictures..."
00:26:56.573,00:26:59.201,...you might actually get some work done around here.
00:26:59.368,00:27:02.663,"Uh-- Sir, she's a prospective client of Stanley's."
00:27:02.830,00:27:04.540,"Oh, really?"
00:27:06.667,00:27:08.127,Well.
00:27:08.710,00:27:12.548,"The next time she comes in, you be sure to send her to my office."
00:27:12.923,00:27:14.466,Ho-ho.
00:27:14.800,00:27:15.843,You betcha.
00:27:20.638,00:27:22.975,"Gee, I wish my daddy owned a bank."
00:27:23.142,00:27:26.395,Then I could be a rich little creep too. Heh-heh.
00:27:26.562,00:27:28.480,"You think she'll ever come back, Charlie?"
00:27:28.646,00:27:30.357,"Oh, man, forget her."
00:27:30.524,00:27:31.942,"Stanley, listen to me."
00:27:32.109,00:27:36.196,"A girl like that is always looking for the BBD: The bigger, better deal."
00:27:36.363,00:27:38.866,"You don't know that, Charlie. She's an artist."
00:27:39.032,00:27:42.161,She's-- She's sensitive.
00:27:42.327,00:27:45.038,"Stanley, forget her. That girl will tear out your heart..."
00:27:45.205,00:27:47.708,...put it in a blender and hit frappé.
00:27:47.875,00:27:51.545,"You don't need her, man. You need somebody a little more down-to-earth..."
00:27:51.712,00:27:59.094,"...somebody with some integrity, somebody with-- Red hair and full pouting lips..."
00:27:59.261,00:28:02.680,"...a white blouse, a green jacket and a name tag."
00:28:02.848,00:28:05.058,"Boy, you really narrowed it down."
00:28:12.024,00:28:14.067,Stanley Ipkiss?
00:28:16.195,00:28:17.654,"Oh, hi."
00:28:17.821,00:28:19.615,I'm Peggy Brandt from The Tribune.
00:28:19.781,00:28:21.950,"Oh, hi."
00:28:22.117,00:28:28.457,"Look, I canceled my subscription because they kept stealing my paper from-- Oh, no. Actually, I just wanna ask you a few questions."
00:28:29.041,00:28:31.251,Really? About what?
00:28:31.418,00:28:35.339,"Ripley Auto Finishing. You're a customer of theirs, aren't you?"
00:28:37.966,00:28:42.221,Me? No. I don't even have a car.
00:28:42.387,00:28:44.973,"You know, because they pollute."
00:28:45.390,00:28:47.601,You don't own an '89 Civic?
00:28:49.853,00:28:54.566,"Oh, that car, yeah. Mm-hm. Uh-- Yeah."
00:28:54.733,00:28:56.401,It's all coming back to me.
00:28:56.568,00:28:58.820,Miss-- What'd you say your name was?
00:28:58.987,00:29:00.322,Peggy Brandt.
00:29:01.406,00:29:04.701,Wait a minute. Peggy Brandt?
00:29:04.868,00:29:05.994,Of Ask Peggy?
00:29:07.579,00:29:08.830,"Yeah, that's right."
00:29:08.997,00:29:11.667,You printed one of my letters last year.
00:29:11.833,00:29:14.336,Remember? Nice guys finish last.
00:29:15.504,00:29:18.131,-You're Mr. Nice Guy? -Yes.
00:29:18.298,00:29:19.675,"Oh, Stanley."
00:29:19.841,00:29:22.386,Do you realize how much mail we got about that letter?
00:29:22.552,00:29:27.516,There are literally hundreds of women out there looking for a guy just like you.
00:29:29.059,00:29:31.311,-Really? -Yeah.
00:29:31.478,00:29:34.398,Do you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town?
00:29:34.564,00:29:37.317,Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood.
00:29:37.484,00:29:39.111,Ah-ha.
00:29:42.030,00:29:45.033,So why are you covering this story?
00:29:45.200,00:29:48.704,Because Dear Peggy pays dick. I'm starving to death.
00:29:48.870,00:29:51.123,I'm looking to become a real reporter.
00:29:51.290,00:29:53.375,"Look, Stanley, when you were at Ripley Auto..."
00:29:53.542,00:29:56.503,...did you see anything suspicious? Anything at all?
00:29:56.670,00:30:00.132,I won't make trouble for you. I just want the truth.
00:30:01.591,00:30:05.721,"God, I wish I knew the truth, you know? I really do."
00:30:07.097,00:30:08.223,No.
00:30:08.598,00:30:13.395,"Well, if you think of anything, this is my number."
00:30:13.937,00:30:17.649,"This is my, you know, personal number."
00:30:19.818,00:30:22.321,You really think women are looking for a guy like me?
00:30:22.487,00:30:24.448,Sure.
00:30:24.823,00:30:26.742,I'm one of them.
00:30:27.075,00:30:30.203,I mean-- Heh. Bye.

00:30:42.591,00:30:43.842,"Hello, Dorian."
00:30:47.346,00:30:49.598,Thanks for dropping by.
00:30:49.765,00:30:52.601,"Yeah, well, next time why don't you call, all right?"
00:30:52.768,00:30:55.103,Leave the delivery boys at home.
00:31:06.239,00:31:07.699,Aah.
00:31:15.624,00:31:21.296,The cops tried to shut the club down this morning.
00:31:22.005,00:31:26.426,They say you've been using the place to run your own small-time scams.
00:31:26.968,00:31:32.557,"I hear things like that, I start losing my concentration."
00:31:33.308,00:31:35.310,And my game...
00:31:35.769,00:31:38.814,...it goes straight to hell.
00:31:40.649,00:31:42.818,You could too.

00:31:49.866,00:31:53.078,But I'm going to cut you a break.
00:31:54.704,00:31:57.666,One week to get out of town.
00:31:57.833,00:31:59.918,After that...
00:32:00.085,00:32:04.673,...I'll use your empty little skull to break in my new nine-iron.

00:32:47.090,00:32:48.967,"Your car, sir."
00:32:52.721,00:32:54.723,I am now.
00:33:12.949,00:33:15.243,"Tina, come on."
00:33:16.119,00:33:19.247,We can't. We can't.
00:33:20.957,00:33:22.083,Aah!
00:33:22.250,00:33:23.585,Milo.
00:33:23.752,00:33:25.212,Go on.
00:33:27.088,00:33:29.883,I don't believe it.
00:33:49.110,00:33:51.238,Stupid.
00:33:52.781,00:34:22.477,She would never-- No way.
00:34:51.298,00:34:56.928,"Hold on, sugar. Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight."
00:34:57.679,00:34:59.848,Ha-ha-ha!
00:35:11.651,00:35:12.819,Ooh!
00:35:12.986,00:35:16.323,Somebody stop me.
00:35:18.408,00:35:19.826,Uh-oh.
00:35:20.535,00:35:23.246,Can't make the scene if you don't have the green.
00:35:23.413,00:35:26.041,I better make a little stop.
00:35:37.886,00:35:39.137,"It's looking good here, my man."
00:35:39.346,00:35:41.222,"Okay, you boys are on your own now."
00:35:41.389,00:35:43.475,I gotta get downstairs and make sure I'm seen.
00:35:43.642,00:35:48.229,Do it. The doctor is about to operate.
00:36:11.586,00:36:14.214,"Sorry, fellas. Waste not, want not."
00:36:14.422,00:36:16.007,Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
00:36:25.433,00:36:27.394,Cops!
00:36:35.610,00:36:37.278,"I have a reservation. Come on, dude."
00:36:37.445,00:36:39.280,"You're not on the list, you're not in the club."

00:36:56.965,00:36:58.883,How do?

00:37:04.472,00:37:05.640,Are you on the list?
00:37:06.057,00:37:08.685,"No, but I believe my friends are."
00:37:08.852,00:37:10.854,Perhaps you know them.
00:37:11.020,00:37:13.982,"Franklin, Grant and Jackson."
00:37:22.115,00:37:23.908,"Okay, that's it, nobody's getting in!"
00:37:27.620,00:37:28.913,MAN: And now we present to you...

00:39:02.674,00:39:05.718,We got trouble. You'd better come upstairs.
00:39:06.511,00:39:08.096,"Come on, let's go."
00:39:43.256,00:39:46.259,Let's rock this joint.
00:40:58.498,00:40:59.874,Smoking.
00:41:01.542,00:41:04.337,"Oh. Man, what happened?"
00:41:07.632,00:41:09.717,Somebody hit the joint before we could.
00:41:11.803,00:41:13.680,"Here, Doc."
00:41:14.514,00:41:16.891,"Here you go, buddy. Suck on that."

00:42:22.707,00:42:24.625,I want this place cleared right now.
00:42:40.433,00:42:43.227,-Hello. -Club's closed. Move it.
00:42:43.394,00:42:45.772,You think I'm joking? Come on. Move it.
00:42:46.314,00:42:48.483,"Party's over. Everyone, let's go."
00:42:48.649,00:42:49.942,"Tina, get out of here."
00:42:50.109,00:42:51.152,EDDY: Come on. Party's over.
00:42:51.319,00:42:52.487,DORIAN: Get lost. EDDY: Go.
00:42:53.821,00:42:55.323,"Okay, twinkle toes."
00:42:55.490,00:42:58.159,I wanna know where my money is and I wanna know right now.
00:42:58.326,00:43:00.328,Okay.
00:43:04.248,00:43:07.835,You've got 17.5 percent in T-bills amortized over the fiscal year.
00:43:08.002,00:43:09.170,Eight percent in stocks.
00:43:09.337,00:43:11.756,"Carry the nine, divide by the gross national product."
00:43:11.923,00:43:15.968,"Fortunately, funeral bouquets are deductible."
00:43:16.636,00:43:17.929,Ice this deadbeat.
00:43:22.892,00:43:23.935,Whoa!
00:43:24.352,00:43:25.937,Shoot him.
00:43:28.856,00:43:30.691,Hi-hi-hi-hi.
00:43:32.527,00:43:34.570,Hoo. Hah.
00:43:35.822,00:43:38.199,Ah. Oh.
00:43:54.006,00:43:56.425,"Hold me close, Red."
00:43:57.218,00:43:58.719,It's getting dark.
00:44:03.766,00:44:07.103,Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out.
00:44:10.815,00:44:13.860,Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home this Christmas.
00:44:25.496,00:44:26.664,Pardon me.
00:44:38.259,00:44:42.096,You love me. You really love me.
00:44:48.311,00:44:50.813,You're not going anywhere.
00:44:57.445,00:44:59.780,"Drop it, Tyrell!"
00:45:02.283,00:45:03.576,"Hey, Kellaway."
00:45:03.743,00:45:05.077,Drop it.
00:45:05.328,00:45:06.913,All right.
00:45:07.788,00:45:11.250,"So you got a warrant this time, or you just stop by for a nightcap?"
00:45:12.543,00:45:15.254,What I got is probable cause.
00:45:15.421,00:45:17.714,Your boys were spotted knocking over City Bank.
00:45:17.882,00:45:19.592,"Easy, you're giving me a woody here."
00:45:19.759,00:45:22.303,And one of them was wearing a big green mask.
00:45:22.637,00:45:24.889,"You know, for once, Kellaway, you're right."
00:45:25.056,00:45:27.350,Except it wasn't one of my boys.
00:45:27.516,00:45:32.605,"Maybe if you tried a little actual police work-- -Cuff him. COP: Hey, lieutenant."
00:45:33.022,00:45:36.234,We got a stiff upstairs. It's one of the guys from the heist.
00:45:36.651,00:45:39.111,"Better call that high-priced lawyer of yours, Tyrell."
00:45:39.278,00:45:41.489,You and I are going downtown for a little chat.
00:45:41.864,00:45:43.991,Get him out of here.
00:45:56.671,00:45:58.839,Ipkiss.
00:46:03.678,00:46:05.721,"KELLAWAY: Ipkiss, I know you're in there."
00:46:09.558,00:46:11.185,KELLAWAY: Police.
00:46:12.395,00:46:17.108,"Oh, my-- KELLAWAY: Open up. -Oh, my God."
00:46:19.902,00:46:23.364,"KELLAWAY: Ipkiss, I know you're in there."
00:46:30.371,00:46:33.332,"Open up. Come on, I'm getting blisters on my fingers."
00:46:33.499,00:46:35.584,"Hey, Milo, no, no."
00:46:37.878,00:46:40.881,"No, no, no. Stop it."
00:46:41.424,00:46:45.344,"I'm coming. Okay, I'm coming. I'll be right there."
00:46:49.557,00:46:53.436,"-Let's go, Ipkiss. Move it. STANLEY: All right."
00:46:59.442,00:47:00.985,"Hi, lieutenant."
00:47:01.152,00:47:06.699,"Listen, this isn't the best time right now. I just-- Won't you come in?"
00:47:09.493,00:47:11.078,"Where were you last night, Ipkiss?"
00:47:12.121,00:47:14.749,Here mostly. Is something wrong?
00:47:14.915,00:47:17.501,What do you know about this Mask character?
00:47:17.668,00:47:20.755,"-Mask? -Don't insult my intelligence, Ipkiss."
00:47:20.921,00:47:24.675,He robs the bank you work in and then I find this in the Coco Bongo.
00:47:24.841,00:47:27.386,There can't be two idiots with pajamas like these.
00:47:28.179,00:47:29.680,"Milo, no!"
00:47:30.097,00:47:31.932,"May I see those pajamas, Mr. Ipkiss?"
00:47:34.268,00:47:38.314,Those pajamas? Those pajamas were...
00:47:40.107,00:47:41.275,...stolen.
00:47:41.692,00:47:43.944,Somebody stole your pajamas?
00:47:49.283,00:47:53.454,"I mean, what is--? What is this city coming to..."
00:47:53.621,00:47:59.377,...when a man's pajama drawer is no longer safe?
00:48:04.090,00:48:07.385,"DOYLE: Wow, look at that guy. Nobody's that fast at my bank."
00:48:07.551,00:48:09.470,KELLAWAY: I'll say.
00:48:11.722,00:48:14.141,"I don't know, boss, that's one hell of a rubber mask."
00:48:14.308,00:48:15.559,What do the reports say?
00:48:15.726,00:48:17.937,We got fingerprints on some of the currency...
00:48:18.104,00:48:21.816,...but nothing matches Tyrell's men. Looks like this guy beat them to the punch.
00:48:21.982,00:48:25.152,Get the bank employee files and run the prints on a guy named Ipkiss.
00:48:25.319,00:48:26.654,Stanley Ipkiss.
00:48:26.862,00:48:29.281,-Ah. You figure it was an inside job? -Right.
00:48:29.448,00:48:32.952,All I need is a couple of prints to lock this wack job up till doomsday.
00:48:35.413,00:48:37.331,DORIAN: Fifty grand.
00:48:37.498,00:48:40.751,Fifty grand to the man who finds that green-faced son of a bitch...
00:48:40.917,00:48:42.169,...before the cops do.
00:48:42.336,00:48:43.920,I want you to get the word out...
00:48:44.088,00:48:47.341,"...to every street hustler, to every lowlife in this town."
00:48:47.508,00:48:52.179,"You understand? I want him here tomorrow, alive."
00:48:53.389,00:48:57.059,"You're still here? Come on, let's go!"
00:49:01.897,00:49:04.775,-What are you looking at? -You.
00:49:06.527,00:49:12.199,"Oh, no. I'm not losing anything. Except maybe some extra baggage around here."
00:49:12.491,00:49:13.868,What is that supposed to mean?
00:49:14.493,00:49:18.372,"You know, you weren't putting up much of a fight with that freak show last night..."
00:49:18.539,00:49:19.956,...when he tried to kiss you.
00:49:20.124,00:49:23.085,Did it look like I had much of a choice?
00:49:24.211,00:49:26.005,Maybe you did...
00:49:28.090,00:49:31.093,"...maybe you didn't. Heh. Who knows, right?"
00:49:32.470,00:49:33.721,I'll tell you one thing.
00:49:34.847,00:49:38.184,It's gonna be payback for anybody who crosses me.
00:49:47.401,00:49:48.694,Ipkiss.
00:49:48.861,00:49:52.281,"We have a crisis on our hands here, and you stroll in over an hour late?"
00:49:52.448,00:49:58.913,"If I have to put up with your behavior-- Back off, monkey boy, before I tell your daddy you're running this place..."
00:49:59.079,00:50:01.040,...like it's your own personal piggy bank.
00:50:01.207,00:50:02.958,Or maybe we should call the IRS...
00:50:03.125,00:50:06.378,...and see if we can arrange a little vacation for you at Club Fed!
00:50:09.548,00:50:11.759,"That'll be all, Ipkiss."
00:50:15.304,00:50:20.100,"Genius. That was genius. Buddy, I have chills."
00:50:20.267,00:50:24.020,"God. What side of whose bed did you wake up on, man?"
00:50:24.188,00:50:26.106,I'm not sure.
00:50:26.732,00:50:29.068,I haven't exactly been myself lately.
00:50:29.235,00:50:31.111,"Well, you don't look real fabulous, Stan."
00:50:31.278,00:50:33.572,Really? Do I look bad?
00:50:33.739,00:50:37.993,"Ah. Not to worry. This will put the color back in your cheeks, my friend."
00:50:38.160,00:50:42.331,Two tickets to the charity ball at the Coco Bongo Club this Saturday night.
00:50:42.498,00:50:44.917,Anybody who's anybody will be there.
00:50:45.084,00:50:46.669,Wanna be my date?
00:50:46.835,00:50:55.386,"I don't know, Charlie, I-- Wait just a minute."
00:50:55.970,00:50:59.306,"-Tina, what are you doing here? -I just wanted to thank you..."
00:51:00.474,00:51:03.936,...but I'm not sure if I'm gonna have much to open an account with anymore.
00:51:04.103,00:51:06.772,"Well, what about the club? I thought you were doing great."
00:51:06.939,00:51:09.316,"Look, it's not your problem. I'll be okay."
00:51:09.483,00:51:11.860,"Tina, come here."
00:51:16.323,00:51:19.326,"You didn't stop by just to see me, did you?"
00:51:22.078,00:51:23.622,"It's okay, tell me."
00:51:26.333,00:51:29.837,-The guy they say robbed this place-- -The Mask?
00:51:30.004,00:51:31.839,I think he was at the club last night.
00:51:32.840,00:51:36.343,Really? They say he's pretty...
00:51:37.261,00:51:39.263,...weird-looking.
00:51:41.348,00:51:45.519,"Yeah, but you ought to see him dance."
00:51:47.021,00:51:50.524,So did anyone find out who he is?
00:51:51.400,00:51:52.693,"Why, are you interested?"
00:51:54.612,00:51:57.031,"Just curious, I guess."
00:51:58.741,00:52:01.952,"Well, I better be going."
00:52:02.369,00:52:04.705,"Thanks for everything, Stanley."
00:52:05.998,00:52:08.542,"You'd like to see him again, wouldn't you?"
00:52:11.545,00:52:15.215,"I, um, wouldn't mind."
00:52:16.008,00:52:17.968,"I know him, you know."
00:52:18.552,00:52:19.720,You do?
00:52:20.054,00:52:22.890,"We're old college buddies, him and me."
00:52:24.266,00:52:27.728,It's funny you should mention the way he dances because...
00:52:31.065,00:52:34.610,...I taught him a couple of dance moves myself.
00:52:34.860,00:52:37.780,Do you think you could have him meet me tonight?
00:52:38.072,00:52:40.074,I might be able to work something out.
00:52:40.240,00:52:43.077,-How about at Landfill Park? -Okay. Sunset?
00:52:43.243,00:52:45.329,-Perfect. -Super.
00:52:46.538,00:52:50.292,"Thanks, Stanley. You really are a nice guy."
00:52:56.924,00:52:59.009,"This is an interesting piece, Mr. Ipkiss."
00:52:59.175,00:53:02.262,Looks like fourth- or fifth-century Scandinavian.
00:53:02.429,00:53:05.849,Possibly a representation of one of the Norse night gods.
00:53:06.016,00:53:08.060,Maybe Loki.
00:53:09.603,00:53:11.230,Loki?
00:53:11.563,00:53:13.107,Who's Loki?
00:53:13.440,00:53:15.359,The Norse god of mischief.
00:53:15.526,00:53:17.361,"Supposedly, he caused so much trouble..."
00:53:17.528,00:53:20.614,...that Odin banished him from Valhalla forever.
00:53:22.741,00:53:25.452,Then he could've banished him into that mask.
00:53:25.869,00:53:30.582,"I'm talking about mythology, Mr. Ipkiss. This is a piece of wood."
00:53:31.542,00:53:33.127,But your book.
00:53:33.293,00:53:36.630,"My book is about masks as metaphor, Mr. Ipkiss."
00:53:36.797,00:53:41.802,A metaphor. Not to be taken literally. You're suffering from mild delusion.
00:53:43.721,00:53:44.805,Oh.
00:53:44.972,00:53:46.765,All right.
00:53:49.852,00:53:52.146,I'm gonna prove it to you.
00:53:52.771,00:53:56.232,But I am not responsible for the consequences.
00:53:56.400,00:54:00.320,"Just sit back and enjoy the ride, Mr. Expert."
00:54:00.779,00:54:03.657,"You don't scare me, Mr. Ipkiss. Go right ahead."
00:54:04.783,00:54:06.618,See you.
00:54:31.810,00:54:36.190,Okay. You said Loki was a night god. Maybe it only works at night.
00:54:36.356,00:54:38.358,"Mr. Ipkiss, I feel I should warn you..."
00:54:38.525,00:54:41.695,...that I don't work personally with really sick people.
00:54:41.862,00:54:44.698,There are private institutions for things like that.
00:54:44.865,00:54:48.660,"However, if you would like me to arrange for a safe environment for you tonight..."
00:54:48.827,00:54:50.120,...I can do that.
00:54:50.286,00:54:51.830,No.
00:54:53.499,00:54:55.667,I've gotta see Tina.
00:54:56.460,00:55:02.716,"But what do I do? I mean, do I go as myself or the Mask?"
00:55:04.218,00:55:08.388,"If I tell you, you promise to leave my office right now?"
00:55:09.014,00:55:10.557,Mm-hm.
00:55:10.724,00:55:12.267,All right.
00:55:12.434,00:55:18.941,"Mr. Ipkiss, go as yourself and as the Mask..."
00:55:19.233,00:55:23.570,...because they are both one and the same beautiful person.
00:55:27.533,00:55:28.575,"It's Ipkiss, all right."
00:55:28.742,00:55:32.412,I'm looking at him. Just keep the SWAT team standing by.
00:55:32.579,00:55:36.708,"If this guy's half as bad as he's supposed to be, we're gonna have a full dance card."
00:55:36.875,00:55:39.086,"DOYLE: Do you have the relish? -Doyle, get in the car."
00:55:39.253,00:55:41.755,-But I ordered onion rings. -Doyle.
00:56:04.945,00:56:07.363,"No, no."
00:56:07.531,00:56:10.701,"Stanley, what are you doing here?"
00:56:10.868,00:56:13.369,"Tina, hi. Uh...."
00:56:13.537,00:56:17.332,I just wanted to come by and make sure that you two got together all right.
00:56:17.499,00:56:22.671,"That's nice. You know, I hardly ever stop by here."
00:56:22.838,00:56:26.216,It's kind of hard to believe it was just a garbage heap.
00:56:26.382,00:56:33.432,"Yeah, it's-- It's-- It's really beautiful right around sunset."
00:56:33.599,00:56:36.476,The methane emissions really pick up the colors.
00:56:36.643,00:56:42.190,Wow. All those pinks and greens.
00:56:45.944,00:56:47.821,Uh....
00:56:47.988,00:56:51.241,My friend will be along here any minute. I better go.
00:56:53.452,00:56:57.164,"Stanley, wait. Stanley. Stanley."
00:57:05.130,00:57:07.633,Is it fate? Is it meant to be?
00:57:07.799,00:57:11.970,Is it written in the stars that we are destined to fraternize?
00:57:12.679,00:57:17.184,I'd like to think so. Ha-ha-ha.
00:57:19.102,00:57:23.565,"Kiss me, my dear, and I will reveal my croissant."
00:57:23.732,00:57:28.862,I will spread your pâté. I will dip my ladle in your vichyssoise.
00:57:29.029,00:57:31.031,-Uhn! -Whoa!
00:57:46.880,00:57:49.341,...and I am a little thorny.
00:57:50.842,00:57:54.137,"Je t'adore, je te window, I don't care."
00:57:56.390,00:57:58.850,"This is Kellaway. I need backup, and I need it now."
00:58:00.394,00:58:03.355,Cigarette? No?
00:58:13.615,00:58:19.830,"Now, like Napoleon, I will divide and conquer."
00:58:21.415,00:58:22.749,"Ipkiss, police."
00:58:25.127,00:58:26.878,KELLAWAY: Freeze!
00:58:30.882,00:58:32.092,Put your hands up.
00:58:35.012,00:58:38.348,"All right, all right, unfreeze."
00:58:38.890,00:58:40.892,You're under arrest.
00:58:41.268,00:58:46.273,"No, it wasn't me. It was the one-armed man."
00:58:47.149,00:58:48.859,"All right, I confess."
00:58:49.317,00:58:53.071,"I did it, you hear? And I'm glad. Glad, I tell you."
00:58:58.452,00:59:01.371,"Sorry, son, that's not my department."
00:59:01.538,00:59:03.206,Search him.
00:59:04.583,00:59:05.792,Ow!
00:59:05.959,00:59:07.544,Where's a camcorder when you need one?
00:59:13.550,00:59:15.594,"Well, looks like it's gonna be a long night."
00:59:15.761,00:59:17.679,-My wife's gonna kill me. -What is it?
00:59:17.846,00:59:20.432,Cops got your pal Ipkiss staked out at Landfill Park.
00:59:20.599,00:59:24.311,Let me cover it. I really need this story. And then you can go home to Claire.
00:59:24.478,00:59:31.485,"Oh, I don't know, Peggy. Ramsey said-- Wo-oh! I will take care of Ramsey. Thanks a million. I owe you one."
00:59:32.069,00:59:34.321,DOYLE: Really big sunglasses.
00:59:34.488,00:59:36.406,Bike horn.

00:59:50.504,00:59:52.589,I've never seen those before in my life.
00:59:52.756,00:59:54.925,-Bazooka. -I have a permit for that.
00:59:56.009,00:59:57.844,-Picture of Kellaway's wife. -What?
00:59:58.011,00:59:59.429,Uh-oh.
00:59:59.888,01:00:02.307,Margaret! You son of a bitch.
01:00:02.891,01:00:07.896,"Jeez, I figured you had a sense of humor. After all, you married her."
01:00:10.440,01:00:12.484,That's gotta hurt.
01:00:13.151,01:00:14.611,Get him.
01:00:14.778,01:00:16.363,Doyle.
01:00:37.968,01:00:39.219,"It's all over, Ipkiss."
01:00:39.386,01:00:43.140,"Put your hands over your head, or we'll open fire."
01:00:46.268,01:00:47.310,Hit it.
01:02:19.361,01:02:20.987,-Not bad. -Shut up and help me down.
01:02:21.154,01:02:22.197,All right.

01:02:47.639,01:02:50.016,"You start dancing, I'll blow your brains out."
01:02:54.521,01:02:56.189,Give me that thing!
01:02:57.357,01:02:58.358,See you.
01:02:58.525,01:03:01.111,There he is. Let's get him. Snap out of it.
01:03:01.278,01:03:05.824,"Come on, this dance is over. Let's go. Follow me, officer."
01:03:11.079,01:03:15.125,"He's down the alley. Follow me. Come on, grab your gun."
01:03:33.852,01:03:34.894,PEGGY: Stanley!

01:03:42.402,01:03:44.404,Halt or I'll shoot.
01:03:46.656,01:03:48.575,Shoot! Shoot!
01:03:49.659,01:03:51.244,PEGGY: Seat belts.
01:03:55.623,01:03:57.167,I missed him.
01:03:57.834,01:04:01.046,Come on. We all missed him.
01:04:06.593,01:04:08.470,PEGGY: I saw it.
01:04:09.262,01:04:11.556,I saw everything.
01:04:11.931,01:04:14.517,"What's happening to you, Stanley?"
01:04:16.770,01:04:18.563,It's crazy.
01:04:22.984,01:04:25.320,I'm losing control.
01:04:25.945,01:04:30.158,"When I put that mask on, I can do anything."
01:04:30.325,01:04:33.703,Be anything.
01:04:36.247,01:04:38.416,But it's wrecking my life.
01:04:38.583,01:04:41.628,My life is wrecked. Wrecked.
01:04:41.878,01:04:43.505,Wrecked.
01:04:44.089,01:04:47.634,"Look, I don't know what's happening to you, Stanley."
01:04:48.635,01:04:50.887,But I do know this.
01:04:52.597,01:04:55.308,That letter that you sent my column.
01:04:55.517,01:04:58.978,That was from a guy with more guts...
01:04:59.437,01:05:01.314,...and more heart...
01:05:01.481,01:05:04.484,...than any of the creeps that I've met in this city.
01:05:04.901,01:05:07.487,Whatever that mask is...
01:05:07.987,01:05:09.322,...you don't need it.
01:05:10.198,01:05:11.950,You...
01:05:12.367,01:05:14.619,...Stanley Ipkiss...
01:05:14.911,01:05:18.331,...are already all you'll ever need to be.
01:05:22.460,01:05:24.462,"Gosh, Peg."
01:05:26.381,01:05:28.091,Do you really mean that?
01:05:29.509,01:05:32.971,"Actually, no."
01:05:33.388,01:05:34.597,What?
01:05:37.016,01:05:39.602,What took you guys so long? I've been vamping here for 20 minutes.
01:05:40.687,01:05:43.648,-Is this him? -You got the 50 thou?
01:05:44.691,01:05:46.359,Give her the money.
01:05:49.904,01:05:51.197,Right.
01:05:51.364,01:05:54.033,"When he puts on the mask, he turns into that green thing."
01:05:54.200,01:05:56.411,Peggy.
01:05:57.036,01:05:58.872,What are you doing?
01:05:59.205,01:06:04.085,"Sorry, Stanley. You really are a great guy, I just can't lose my condo."
01:06:04.252,01:06:07.338,You know how hard it is to find an apartment in this city.
01:06:08.548,01:06:09.883,Huh.
01:06:12.218,01:06:13.887,You said you wouldn't hurt him.
01:06:16.973,01:06:18.308,I lied.
01:06:26.274,01:06:27.650,Stanley!
01:06:29.611,01:06:32.363,What--? Hey. Hey!
01:06:37.869,01:06:40.622,"Tell me, how does this mask work?"
01:06:41.372,01:06:44.167,I don't know. You just...
01:06:44.709,01:06:45.793,...put it on.
01:06:58.598,01:07:00.183,Boss.
01:07:00.725,01:07:02.352,"You'd better be careful, huh?"
01:07:24.624,01:07:25.667,Oh.
01:07:25.833,01:07:27.919,"Wow, boss."
01:07:28.545,01:07:29.587,You okay?
01:07:30.630,01:07:32.632,"Better than ever, you idiot."
01:07:34.592,01:07:37.095,What do we do with Ipkiss?
01:07:39.305,01:07:41.182,The police are looking for the Mask.
01:07:41.975,01:07:44.310,So we'll give them the Mask.
01:07:54.320,01:07:56.781,"Money better be here, Ipkiss."
01:07:56.948,01:07:59.492,Or you can Ipkiss your ass goodbye.
01:08:06.332,01:08:08.209,"Hey, Orlando."
01:08:46.789,01:08:48.499,ORLANDO: Get over.
01:08:59.844,01:09:01.012,I still can't believe it.
01:09:01.179,01:09:05.266,Hardened cops dancing in the street and broadcast all over the 11:00 news.
01:09:05.433,01:09:07.435,The SWAT team got an offer to open in Vegas.
01:09:07.602,01:09:10.605,I'm history. The captain's gonna have my badge for breakfast...
01:09:10.772,01:09:12.649,...with a little pension on top.
01:09:12.815,01:09:16.861,"Come on, Lieutenant, it's not all your fault. Something will turn up."
01:09:17.028,01:09:19.906,"Sure, Stanley Ipkiss is gonna fall right into my lap."
01:09:26.746,01:09:29.582,KELLAWAY: Get up. Get him off. -Come on.
01:09:31.959,01:09:33.461,Ipkiss.
01:09:36.756,01:09:39.133,"Oh, yeah? You can explain everything?"
01:09:39.300,01:09:41.094,Explain this.
01:09:41.260,01:09:45.223,"Um.... Get him up. Come on, let's go. I got a cell for you, pal."
01:10:04.283,01:10:05.952,Milo.
01:10:11.124,01:10:12.625,Find yourself a new place to live.
01:10:14.961,01:10:17.463,"Looks like I'm gonna be in here for a long, long time."
01:10:30.685,01:10:32.937,"COP: Hey, you, with the face."
01:10:33.646,01:10:35.690,You got a visitor.
01:10:38.609,01:10:40.278,Tina.
01:10:41.028,01:10:42.822,"Hello, Stanley."
01:10:44.323,01:10:46.951,-What are you doing here? -Is it true?
01:10:48.870,01:10:50.329,You're the Mask.
01:10:50.496,01:10:52.123,"Yeah, but don't tell anybody."
01:10:52.290,01:10:58.796,"If I get a good lawyer and strike up a deal, I can be out of here in about 10,000 years."
01:10:59.839,01:11:03.843,You're taking a chance coming here. Your boyfriend might be a little upset.
01:11:05.511,01:11:09.599,He's going to the charity ball tonight. He's gonna do something terrible.
01:11:09.766,01:11:11.976,Like what? The lambada?
01:11:12.810,01:11:16.189,"Stanley, this is serious. There's gotta be a way to stop him."
01:11:16.814,01:11:18.775,How does it work?
01:11:19.192,01:11:20.860,I don't know.
01:11:21.444,01:11:23.362,It's like....
01:11:24.030,01:11:27.366,It's like it brings your innermost desires to life.
01:11:27.533,01:11:30.203,"If deep down inside, you're..."
01:11:31.245,01:11:34.290,...a little repressed and a hopeless romantic...
01:11:34.874,01:11:39.212,...you become some sort of a love-crazy wild man.
01:11:39.378,01:11:41.339,And if you're somebody like Dorian?
01:11:41.506,01:11:44.050,Then we're all in big trouble.
01:11:44.217,01:11:47.220,"And if I were you, I'd get out of town. Fast."
01:11:50.097,01:11:51.390,Thanks.
01:11:52.391,01:11:55.812,-For what? -Lots of things.
01:11:59.440,01:12:02.068,For sharing a sunset with me.
01:12:03.236,01:12:05.947,For being the only guy who treated me like a person...
01:12:06.113,01:12:08.574,...and not some sort of party favor.
01:12:11.911,01:12:14.580,For being any kind of romantic.
01:12:14.747,01:12:16.582,Even a hopeless one.
01:12:22.296,01:12:24.048,You're welcome.
01:12:24.215,01:12:26.467,You know that night at the club?
01:12:26.926,01:12:29.929,I knew I'd found someone special.
01:12:32.473,01:12:35.268,-The Mask. -No.
01:12:35.434,01:12:40.940,It was the guy inside the mask. It was you all along.
01:12:41.107,01:12:47.238,You. Stanley Ipkiss.
01:12:47.405,01:12:49.866,"COP: Okay, lady, time's up."
01:12:50.032,01:12:54.078,Could I have just one more minute?
01:12:55.830,01:12:58.249,"I've gotta disappear for a while now, Stanley."
01:12:58.624,01:13:01.961,"I don't know where I'm gonna go, but I'll let you know as soon as I can."
01:13:37.663,01:13:38.831,TINA: Aah!
01:13:46.422,01:13:48.674,TINA: Somebody help me!
01:13:50.593,01:13:52.428,"STANLEY: Oh, no. No!"
01:13:53.512,01:13:55.181,Guard. Guard.
01:13:55.348,01:13:58.517,Guard! There's a woman being chased through the alleyway there.
01:13:58.684,01:14:00.519,"Come on, she needs help."
01:14:00.853,01:14:03.230,"Yeah, yeah, sure. Keep it down, Ipkiss."
01:14:03.397,01:14:06.108,"Come on. Serve and protect, man."
01:14:17.578,01:14:18.621,Milo.
01:14:21.874,01:14:23.417,Milo?
01:14:26.671,01:14:29.006,"Milo, good boy. Come on, come on."
01:14:31.217,01:14:33.302,Jump up. Come on. Can you jump up?
01:14:35.054,01:14:38.015,Remember how I taught you not to jump up on people? Forget that.
01:14:38.182,01:14:40.059,"Okay, come on. Come on."
01:14:42.395,01:14:44.146,Get up here. Get up here.
01:14:45.147,01:14:48.192,Get up. Get up here. That's it. You can do it.
01:14:48.359,01:14:52.488,Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
01:14:52.655,01:14:55.366,"Milo, put some effort into it."
01:15:12.550,01:15:14.593,"Baby, there you are."
01:15:14.969,01:15:17.263,I was beginning to get all worried about you.
01:15:17.430,01:15:20.933,-You have a nice talk with the cops? -I went to see what Ipkiss told them.
01:15:21.100,01:15:25.604,"Oh, that's right, you and Stanley, right? You two are getting awfully close."
01:15:25.938,01:15:28.232,Maybe it was you who helped him with the bank job.
01:15:28.399,01:15:31.110,"-That's ridiculous. -Oh, is it?"
01:15:32.403,01:15:34.780,Look what I found in her car.
01:15:35.072,01:15:36.407,Heh.
01:15:36.741,01:15:38.451,"You planning a trip without me, baby?"
01:15:38.617,01:15:40.494,"-No, Dorian. -No?"
01:15:42.288,01:15:44.081,"Boys, I want you..."
01:15:44.457,01:15:47.126,"...to pick her out something pretty to wear, okay?"
01:15:49.295,01:15:51.756,Because we're gonna go to a party tonight.
01:15:51.964,01:15:53.632,We're gonna have one hell of a time.
01:15:53.799,01:15:55.968,-Yes. -Yes.
01:15:56.343,01:15:58.345,Get out of my sight.
01:15:59.305,01:16:01.807,Jump up. Get up. Come on.
01:16:03.809,01:16:06.562,"Come on, Milo, jump, please."
01:16:06.979,01:16:09.023,Do it for Daddy.
01:16:12.651,01:16:14.987,That's it. Oh.
01:16:15.821,01:16:19.450,Come here. I can't believe it. I can't believe you did that.
01:16:19.617,01:16:22.787,"Oh, good boy. Good boy."
01:16:23.829,01:16:25.664,Good boy. Okay.
01:16:26.248,01:16:28.000,See that man over there? He's got keys.
01:16:29.752,01:16:33.964,Yeah. Go get those keys. Go get them.
01:16:34.131,01:16:36.842,Go get the keys. Go get them.
01:16:38.010,01:16:45.518,"That's it. Yeah. Okay, get the ke-- Oh."
01:16:45.684,01:16:49.522,"No, not the cheese, the keys."
01:16:51.857,01:16:52.942,Put the cheese down...
01:16:55.194,01:16:56.612,...and get the keys. Go on.
01:16:56.779,01:16:59.031,Over there. Over there.
01:17:06.163,01:17:07.832,Shh.
01:17:13.879,01:17:15.339,Yeah.
01:17:16.132,01:17:19.677,Come on. Come here. Good boy.
01:17:19.844,01:17:22.888,"That's a good boy. Good boy, yes."
01:17:23.055,01:17:26.892,"Oh, give it, give it. Give me the keys. Give me the keys. Come on. Come on."
01:17:27.059,01:17:28.894,Drop it. Drop it. Drop it.
01:17:29.061,01:17:33.107,It's sundown. It's almost time.
01:17:33.274,01:17:34.483,Oh.
01:17:34.900,01:17:37.069,"I wouldn't do that, darling."
01:17:40.072,01:17:42.658,"Wouldn't want to start the celebration early, would you?"
01:18:24.491,01:18:25.534,Milo.
01:18:26.452,01:18:29.455,BOTH: Aah! -Hold it! I am warning you...
01:18:29.622,01:18:32.708,...I'm seriously stressed out here.
01:18:32.875,01:18:35.544,"-Easy, Ipkiss. -Come on."
01:18:35.961,01:18:39.131,"Now, don't be an idiot. You're in the middle of a police station."
01:18:39.298,01:18:42.635,There is no way you're walking out of here like this.
01:18:43.510,01:18:45.346,"You know, you're right."
01:18:47.806,01:18:51.060,-You're absolutely right. -What the hell are you doing?
01:18:51.977,01:18:55.356,You're gonna take me out as your prisoner.
01:18:55.522,01:18:58.442,Put it on. Put it on!
01:18:58.651,01:19:00.945,Ow. Come on.
01:19:01.111,01:19:03.155,-I'm really very sorry about this. -I'm sure.
01:19:03.322,01:19:04.657,Milo.
01:19:06.951,01:19:11.747,"Got the wrong guy, I tell you. It's a bum rap. I got my rights."
01:19:11.914,01:19:13.999,"Hey, lieutenant. Where are you taking Ipkiss?"
01:19:14.166,01:19:17.169,Ix-nay. E-hay's ot-gay an un-gay. Ow!
01:19:17.503,01:19:20.339,"Oh, I get it. Pig Latin, right?"
01:19:20.756,01:19:22.758,Ee-say ou-yay ater-lay.
01:19:24.301,01:19:25.511,Come on.
01:19:32.977,01:19:36.105,"Why don't you just sit back and relax, okay?"
01:19:37.982,01:19:40.526,I've gotta change for the party.
01:20:06.093,01:20:07.970,"MAN: No more bets, please."
01:20:12.224,01:20:14.435,"-I need a pack of cigarettes. -Which brand, sir?"
01:20:14.601,01:20:19.064,"It doesn't matter. I don't smoke. But for you, I would shoot the Surgeon General."
01:20:19.898,01:20:21.942,"REPORTER: Mayor Tilton, may we have a word with you?"
01:20:22.109,01:20:25.529,"Well, I always have time for the press and my loyal constituents."
01:21:02.399,01:21:05.319,"Let me out of these cuffs, Ipkiss. You're driving like a maniac."
01:21:05.486,01:21:07.279,"I'm sorry, we're late for the ball."
01:21:07.446,01:21:10.532,"Right, Alice and the White Rabbit are gonna be really disappointed."
01:21:10.699,01:21:12.242,Now you're being cynical.
01:21:15.120,01:21:16.288,Who the hell are you?
01:21:16.663,01:21:21.919,I'm just an ex-employee who's come for his back pay.
01:21:22.086,01:21:24.463,Or should I say payback?
01:21:25.339,01:21:26.632,Dorian?
01:21:28.133,01:21:29.885,Kill him.
01:21:48.904,01:21:50.155,Come on.
01:22:12.136,01:22:17.850,"Ladies and gentlemen, I will be your host for the remainder of the evening."
01:22:28.527,01:22:31.280,"Ipkiss, get your dog away from me."
01:22:32.197,01:22:34.199,"I'm sorry, he seems to be attracted to you."
01:22:34.366,01:22:37.369,"Wait a minute, where is everybody? Something's not kosher here."
01:22:37.536,01:22:38.745,-Exactly. -Watch it.
01:22:38.912,01:22:41.707,"I'm sorry. Okay, I'm gonna have to lock you in."
01:22:43.083,01:22:45.377,-Use the radio. -What?
01:22:45.544,01:22:49.173,"You know, call for backup or something."
01:22:49.339,01:22:50.883,Milo.
01:22:51.049,01:22:55.053,This could be dangerous. You stay here and be a good boy.
01:22:55.721,01:22:58.557,Daddy's gonna to have to go kick some ass.
01:23:03.228,01:23:04.730,He's a dead man.
01:23:04.897,01:23:06.064,-Down. Get down. MAN 1: Go.
01:23:06.231,01:23:08.233,"MAN 2: Come on, I ain't got all day. MAN 3: Move it."
01:23:08.400,01:23:11.528,"MAN 4: Hey, line up over here. -Take it easy. I got the point."
01:23:11.695,01:23:15.073,MAN 5: Come on. MAN 6: Move.
01:23:23.290,01:23:25.042,Blow it.
01:23:32.257,01:23:33.759,TINA: Bastard. Aah!
01:23:34.176,01:23:35.761,"What's the matter, darling?"
01:23:35.928,01:23:38.096,This is your big production number.
01:23:38.514,01:23:43.435,"And you know, it's important to go out with a big bang."
01:23:49.274,01:23:50.817,Charlie.
01:23:52.236,01:23:53.737,What are you doing here?
01:23:54.238,01:23:57.282,"Look, take this gun. Start sneaking people out the back."
01:23:57.449,01:23:58.909,Right.
01:24:01.453,01:24:04.206,"MAN: You, step back. -You don't you know who you're talking to."
01:24:04.373,01:24:06.625,MAN: I'm talking to a dead man if you don't step back.
01:24:06.792,01:24:10.170,"WOMAN: Don't you have respect for law and order? What kind of thug are you, huh?"
01:24:10.337,01:24:12.297,"EDDY: It's all set, Dorian."
01:24:12.923,01:24:14.967,Excellent.
01:24:16.009,01:24:17.886,This party's over...
01:24:18.053,01:24:20.055,...in 10 minutes.
01:24:22.057,01:24:23.976,This is the moment of truth.
01:24:24.142,01:24:26.061,When a man shows what he's really made of.
01:24:27.771,01:24:30.983,"-Crap. ORLANDO: Drop it, Ipkiss."
01:24:32.359,01:24:33.443,Aah.
01:24:43.245,01:24:44.705,Smart dog.
01:24:51.003,01:24:54.506,"Hey, boss, look who decided to crash the party."
01:24:54.673,01:24:57.009,"Hi, Dorian. How's it going?"
01:24:57.467,01:25:00.971,"-Bring him up here. -Dorian. Dorian, wait, no."
01:25:01.138,01:25:05.559,Ahhh. There's no time for last requests.
01:25:06.101,01:25:08.520,But all I wanted was a kiss.
01:25:09.229,01:25:11.023,A kiss?
01:25:11.690,01:25:15.068,Just one last kiss.
01:25:15.360,01:25:17.154,"Dorian, I can't shut this thing off."
01:25:18.238,01:25:21.366,There's always time...
01:25:22.367,01:25:24.870,...for one last kiss.
01:25:27.414,01:25:28.957,No!
01:25:29.666,01:25:32.127,From the real Dorian.
01:25:33.170,01:25:35.464,The one I used to love.
01:25:36.965,01:25:39.176,Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian Tyrell.
01:25:40.260,01:25:43.388,"Romeo, this whole place is gonna blow in a couple of minutes."
01:25:43.555,01:25:46.642,Just wait!
01:25:50.062,01:25:52.606,I've decided...
01:26:00.364,01:26:02.991,...to give her one last thrill.
01:26:13.669,01:26:15.253,Get it.
01:26:32.396,01:26:33.855,"Run, Milo!"
01:26:34.022,01:26:35.857,ORLANDO: I got him-- Aah!
01:26:37.234,01:26:39.569,"Stanley, hurry!"
01:26:39.945,01:26:43.782,"Don't worry, Tina. It's all over now."
01:26:47.077,01:26:48.870,Stanley.
01:26:54.584,01:26:56.294,Got you.
01:27:01.091,01:27:03.260,Aah!
01:27:05.971,01:27:08.348,STANLEY: Aah! Yah!
01:27:08.515,01:27:09.725,I'm gonna take you apart.
01:27:10.559,01:27:14.062,"Well, I hope you can enjoy the victory with one frigging eye."
01:27:31.830,01:27:33.415,Good doggy. Shh.
01:27:33.623,01:27:34.666,Good doggy.
01:27:54.227,01:27:55.353,I'm winning.
01:27:59.858,01:28:00.859,TINA: Stanley.
01:28:08.158,01:28:09.951,TINA: Stanley!
01:28:20.921,01:28:22.005,Yes.
01:28:26.551,01:28:29.054,Get off me. Aah!
01:28:29.971,01:28:31.515,Milo.
01:28:33.725,01:28:37.229,"Oh, my God. This has gotta to be a new breed."
01:28:37.395,01:28:39.856,"Oh, easy, boy."
01:28:43.568,01:28:44.653,Good boy.
01:29:15.392,01:29:17.352,Did you miss me?
01:29:24.943,01:29:26.194,I guess not.
01:29:35.579,01:29:38.957,...one question: Do I feel lucky?
01:29:39.291,01:29:40.292,Well?
01:29:42.878,01:29:46.380,"Do you, punks?"
01:29:58.226,01:29:59.311,Stanley!
01:30:07.152,01:30:08.653,Ah.
01:30:11.573,01:30:12.657,Ahh.
01:30:31.718,01:30:33.303,How do?
01:30:39.559,01:30:42.687,This guy's incorrigible.
01:31:10.090,01:31:12.217,"You were good, kid, real good."
01:31:12.384,01:31:16.221,"But as long as I'm around, you'll always be second best, see?"
01:31:36.741,01:31:37.993,COP 1: Police! Hands up!
01:31:38.159,01:31:40.245,COP 2: Hold it right there. COP 3: Get them up!
01:31:40.412,01:31:43.415,"-Officers, arrest those men. COP 4: Drop it. Get down on the ground."
01:31:43.581,01:31:45.959,I've always wanted to say that.
01:31:48.461,01:31:49.671,Come on.
01:31:49.838,01:31:52.382,COP 5: Drop it. -Give me that gun.
01:31:58.013,01:32:05.103,"They stole my jewelry. You take me down to headquarters, and I'll-- KELLAWAY: Stop that man. Ipkiss."
01:32:06.271,01:32:09.607,"I've got you now, Ipkiss. Watch it, chunky."
01:32:09.774,01:32:14.528,"Mayor Tilton, I'm so-- -What the hell's wrong with you, Kellaway? -That man is the Mask."
01:32:14.696,01:32:18.532,"No, Dorian Tyrell was the Mask. I saw it with my own eyes."
01:32:18.700,01:32:22.412,-This young man here just saved our lives. -With a little help from his friends.
01:32:22.579,01:32:24.706,"-Oh, you're a real hero. KELLAWAY: Doyle."
01:32:24.873,01:32:26.666,"Well, it's nothing..."
01:32:26.833,01:32:32.005,...any American with balls of steel wouldn't do for his community.
01:32:32.172,01:32:34.466,"Milo, come on."
01:32:35.549,01:32:37.802,"Hey, wait, that dog."
01:32:37.969,01:32:41.514,"-Mayor Tilton, did you see that dog? -Leave the dog alone."
01:32:41.681,01:32:44.350,I wanna see you in my office first thing tomorrow morning.
01:32:44.517,01:32:47.561,"-Yes, Your Honor. -Boy, that doesn't sound good at all."
01:32:47.729,01:32:51.232,"No, it doesn't sound good. What would sound good to you?"
01:32:51.399,01:32:54.152,-Breakfast. -Shut up.
01:33:13.171,01:33:15.507,"You sure you know what you're doing, buddy?"
01:33:17.509,01:33:19.260,I'm sure.
01:33:19.552,01:33:21.721,Then do what you gotta do.
01:33:34.776,01:33:36.820,Sure you're not gonna miss this guy?
01:33:36.986,01:33:39.864,"When he's gone, all that's left is me."
01:34:18.069,01:34:19.737,Milo.
