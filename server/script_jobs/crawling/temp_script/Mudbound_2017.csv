00:00:58.725,00:00:59.976,We ain't gonna make it.
00:01:04.939,00:01:07.400,"Oh, we will. We have to."
00:01:14.616,00:01:15.575,My turn.
00:01:39.682,00:01:41.434,"That was my brother, Henry."
00:01:42.269,00:01:45.897,Absolutely certain whatever he wanted to happen would.
00:01:49.651,00:01:52.862,The weather would dry out in time to resow the cotton.
00:01:55.657,00:01:58.535,We would get this hole dug before the storm hit.
00:02:00.745,00:02:02.205,-Jesus Christ! -What is it?
00:02:02.289,00:02:03.956,It's a slave's grave.
00:02:08.961,00:02:10.630,Must've been a runaway.
00:02:15.510,00:02:16.511,Settles what?
00:02:16.594,00:02:19.097,I ain't burying my father in no slave's grave.
00:02:19.639,00:02:21.474,Nothing he would've hated more.
00:02:25.937,00:02:27.355,We ain't got a choice.
00:02:43.163,00:02:44.289,Get you out of there!
00:03:09.146,00:03:10.315,Henry!
00:03:25.538,00:03:27.206,Henry!
00:03:27.915,00:03:29.251,Henry!
00:03:31.002,00:03:34.797,"-Henry, where are you? -Right here! I'm here!"
00:03:38.926,00:03:42.472,Absolutely certain whatever he wanted to happen would.
00:03:45.182,00:03:46.726,And his little brother...
00:03:50.813,00:03:55.693,Come on. Come here. Come on. What's the matter with you? Huh?
00:03:55.777,00:03:59.196,I thought you were... gonna leave me down there!
00:04:00.406,00:04:02.325,Come on. Why would I do that?
00:04:03.075,00:04:04.702,Why would I do that?
00:04:48.621,00:04:50.957,Encrusting knees and hair.
00:04:52.166,00:04:55.336,Marching in boot-shaped patches across the floor.
00:04:57.672,00:04:59.632,I dreamed in brown.
00:05:17.149,00:05:19.986,"-Lift it, Jamie. Lift it. -Just get a little more..."
00:05:20.069,00:05:21.571,"Just stop, okay? Let's set it down."
00:05:21.654,00:05:24.616,Why don't we just run the ropes lengthwise? We stand at either end.
00:05:24.699,00:05:27.284,"No, the coffin's too narrow. If it falls again, it might break."
00:05:27.369,00:05:29.579,"-Well, we can try. -No!"
00:05:33.124,00:05:34.501,-Hap! -Henry.
00:05:42.425,00:05:44.010,"Hap, can you hold on?"
00:05:49.682,00:05:51.017,"Can you lend us a hand, Hap?"
00:05:52.101,00:05:54.187,Need to get that coffin in the ground.
00:06:00.818,00:06:01.819,Hap?
00:06:05.907,00:06:09.536,when I met Henry McAllan in the spring of 1939.
00:06:11.579,00:06:14.290,I lived with my parents in the house I grew up in.
00:06:16.042,00:06:20.379,"My world was small, and he was my rescuer from a life in the margins."
00:06:29.138,00:06:31.641,"Did you hear that, Laura? An engineering degree from Ole Miss."
00:06:31.724,00:06:33.017,"My, my, my."
00:06:33.100,00:06:35.812,"You know, Laura is a college graduate."
00:06:35.895,00:06:39.023,She got her teaching certificate from West Tennessee State. We're very proud.
00:06:39.106,00:06:42.068,Mm-hmm. My dear sister's the smartest one in the family.
00:06:42.151,00:06:45.238,Made better grades than I ever did. Never heard the end of it.
00:06:47.824,00:06:52.829,"Laura, you should, uh, play the piano for us after dinner."
00:06:52.912,00:06:53.955,Hmm?
00:06:54.831,00:06:58.209,You should hear her sing. She sings like an angel.
00:06:58.292,00:07:00.670,"Yeah, you should play something for Mr. McAllan later."
00:07:00.753,00:07:03.005,-Mama. Mama. -Ave Maria. That's my favorite.
00:07:03.089,00:07:05.299,-You will love that. It's so beautiful. -Mama.
00:07:05.382,00:07:06.634,What?
00:07:07.301,00:07:12.432,"I'm quite sure that Teddy did not bring his new boss, Mr. McAllan, over to hear hymns."
00:07:13.349,00:07:15.643,"Well, why don't we just ask him."
00:07:17.311,00:07:20.022,Would you like to hear some music after dinner?
00:07:25.945,00:07:27.196,I like hymns.
00:07:39.834,00:07:45.840,It was at least a reprieve from the sincere pity and insincere kindness directed at old maids.
00:07:48.718,00:07:52.096,He didn't feel the need to fill the air with words like I did.
00:07:52.972,00:07:54.348,He had the self-confidence I lacked.
00:07:57.644,00:08:00.312,I can't say I was truly in love with him then...
00:08:02.064,00:08:05.693,"but I was so grateful to him, it dwarfed everything else."
00:08:08.613,00:08:11.365,My brother Jamie's coming up from Oxford next weekend.
00:08:13.242,00:08:14.785,I'd like for him to meet you.
00:08:29.759,00:08:32.595,Brother! Brother!
00:08:44.398,00:08:46.943,The air up here in Memphis agrees with you.
00:08:47.819,00:08:49.153,Or is it something else?
00:08:49.946,00:08:52.657,"Miss Chappell, this here is my brother, Jamie."
00:08:52.740,00:08:55.034,-Pleased to meet you. -Pleasure's all mine.
00:08:55.117,00:08:58.204,"Oh, he thinks he's one of them characters in his plays."
00:08:58.287,00:09:02.750,"Yes, but which play is it, dear brother? Hamlet? Faust? Prince Hal?"
00:09:02.834,00:09:05.252,One of them fellas that could earn you a decent wage someday.
00:09:06.754,00:09:07.964,"What do you think, Miss Chappell?"
00:09:10.299,00:09:12.259,I think you're more of a Puck.
00:09:15.262,00:09:16.806,Puck's a kind of mischievous sprite.
00:09:17.557,00:09:18.725,He's a hobgoblin.
00:09:18.808,00:09:21.728,"Forgive me, brother. I'm only trying to impress her."
00:09:21.811,00:09:25.189,"Oh, you'll find Miss Laura is not the impressionable type."
00:09:48.755,00:09:55.177,"concussed and bleeding, and I was as good as gone, another victim of the Great Flood of '27."
00:09:55.261,00:09:57.889,-I can't believe you never told me this. -There's more.
00:09:57.972,00:09:59.056,Then what happened?
00:09:59.766,00:10:07.481,"Well, I saw a shimmering light, And a great big hand reached out of it and I thought it was God himself come to take me."
00:10:07.565,00:10:10.735,"But it wasn't. It was my dear big brother, Henry."
00:10:12.028,00:10:15.489,"-You saved his life. You're a hero. -Indeed, he is."
00:10:15.573,00:10:18.409,"Well, what was I supposed to do, huh? Let him drown?"
00:10:18.492,00:10:21.662,"Here's to the future, whatever it may hold."
00:10:21.746,00:10:28.628,"May you be blessed with happiness, health, prosperity, and if she'll have you, a house full of children."
00:10:31.631,00:10:33.299,My love to you both.
00:10:46.562,00:10:49.523,Would you mind terribly if I had a dance with your girl?
00:10:54.904,00:10:57.406,"Miss Chappell, care to take a spin?"
00:10:58.074,00:10:59.742,I'd be delighted.
00:11:26.394,00:11:31.065,"And when his eyes were on me, I felt like I was no longer invisible."
00:12:32.168,00:12:33.586,You look especially pretty tonight.
00:12:37.465,00:12:39.550,Jamie has that effect on girls.
00:12:40.384,00:12:42.178,They sparkle for him.
00:12:44.972,00:12:46.933,He likes you. I can tell.
00:12:48.309,00:12:50.686,I'm sure he doesn't dislike anyone.
00:13:05.451,00:13:09.788,He wasn't kneeling and the question came out as more of a statement.
00:13:10.915,00:13:13.584,Henry wasn't a romantic.
00:13:14.168,00:13:16.545,He was made of sturdier stuff.
00:13:26.889,00:13:28.432,-Yeah? -Yeah.
00:13:31.936,00:13:36.440,Yielding to Henry and waiting for him to come home to me was what I'd been put on Earth to do.
00:13:38.943,00:13:42.989,"And when Amanda Leigh was born, I became hers completely."
00:13:44.656,00:13:47.076,Then came the day that changed everything.
00:13:47.993,00:13:48.994,Forever.
00:13:56.627,00:14:00.756,a date which will live in infamy.
00:14:02.091,00:14:04.134,The United States of America...
00:14:04.927,00:14:07.721,was suddenly and deliberately attacked...
00:14:08.389,00:14:13.144,by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.
00:14:14.728,00:14:22.236,"The United States was at peace with that nation, and at the solicitation of Japan..."
00:14:27.700,00:14:29.243,That's what I remember most.
00:14:30.744,00:14:33.164,The first things and the last things...
00:14:34.040,00:14:36.333,they always stick the hardest.
00:14:38.836,00:14:39.670,Thank you.
00:14:45.384,00:14:46.552,We'll be praying for you.
00:14:47.719,00:14:48.762,All right.
00:14:54.226,00:14:55.602,"Oh, I won't."
00:14:56.645,00:14:59.523,I won't. Okay?
00:15:05.195,00:15:06.196,I will.
00:15:08.407,00:15:11.368,"Y'all pitch in good around here, yeah? Help your mother, now."
00:15:16.623,00:15:19.626,Keep them no 'count boys off Lilly May. Don't let her get old so fast.
00:15:26.008,00:15:28.510,-You just come back. -I will.
00:15:28.594,00:15:31.722,You come all the way back. You hear?
00:15:35.309,00:15:37.728,"-I love you, Mama. -I love you, too, baby."
00:15:55.871,00:15:57.123,Thank you.
00:16:13.973,00:16:15.599,I didn't look back.
00:16:19.979,00:16:22.648,They say it's bad luck to watch somebody leave.
00:16:27.361,00:16:29.571,I held his heartbeat in my hand.
00:16:30.948,00:16:32.408,I remember every beat.
00:16:34.994,00:16:36.787,He was warm and alive.
00:16:38.497,00:16:40.290,I know every place in him...
00:16:44.836,00:16:47.381,and it was all I could do to not look back.
00:16:49.341,00:16:51.343,"No, I don't have favorites."
00:16:52.428,00:16:54.138,I love them all equally.
00:16:54.680,00:16:56.140,Every mother does.
00:17:05.357,00:17:07.318,all that time he was gone...
00:17:09.528,00:17:11.363,I only prayed for him.
00:17:14.867,00:17:16.035,God will forgive me.
00:17:33.885,00:17:35.762,Dig that hole in there.
00:18:01.830,00:18:05.041,"Come on, Ruel. Let's go. Come on."
00:18:05.125,00:18:08.295,Keep going. Supper's gonna be ready when we get in.
00:18:13.925,00:18:28.774,"My grandfathers and great uncles, grandmothers and great aunts, father and mother, broke, tilled, thawed, planted, plucked, raised, burned, broke again."
00:18:29.691,00:18:34.822,"Worked this land all their life, this land that never would be theirs."
00:18:37.658,00:18:40.786,They worked until they sweated. They sweated until they bled.
00:18:40.869,00:18:43.289,They bled until they died.
00:18:43.372,00:18:47.751,Died with the dirt of this same 200 acres under their fingernails.
00:18:48.836,00:18:55.050,"Died clawing at the hard, brown back that would never be theirs."
00:18:58.220,00:18:59.721,All their deeds undone.
00:19:03.099,00:19:06.395,"Yet this man, this place, this law..."
00:19:07.062,00:19:10.774,say you need a deed. Not deeds.
00:19:19.283,00:19:21.076,Calvin Augustus got his land here...
00:19:22.161,00:19:24.204,and then Bud Leo bought land here.
00:19:25.956,00:19:29.918,Now I figure there's a couple acres right here.
00:19:30.001,00:19:32.338,If only fences can be put up with lead.
00:19:33.088,00:19:35.507,They get taken down with lead all the time.
00:19:36.758,00:19:38.427,"Won't be too much longer, Papa, will it?"
00:19:38.510,00:19:43.724,"Around this time next year, I'm gonna have me about 50 acres of cotton, 50 acres of oats, 50 acres of rice."
00:19:43.807,00:19:45.351,"Fool, rice don't grow here."
00:19:49.313,00:19:52.858,That's why I'm not gonna be no farmer. I'm gonna be a stenographer.
00:19:52.941,00:19:55.110,-A ste... what? -It's kind of like a typist.
00:19:56.237,00:19:59.198,-They don't allow no colored typists. -Your sister will be the first.
00:20:25.098,00:20:26.391,"Honey, by the way..."
00:20:27.267,00:20:29.519,I bought a farm in Mississippi.
00:20:31.062,00:20:34.107,And we'll be moving there in three weeks' time.
00:20:39.613,00:20:41.657,It's 40 miles south of Greenville.
00:20:42.491,00:20:44.075,Big old...
00:20:45.201,00:20:47.871,"porch, fig tree..."
00:20:48.830,00:20:50.916,Girls are gonna love the four bedrooms.
00:20:52.083,00:20:53.502,But we love this house.
00:20:53.585,00:20:56.922,But now they get their own room each and Pappy gets his own space.
00:20:57.005,00:20:58.089,Pappy?
00:20:59.716,00:21:02.135,"Honey, now Mama's gone, we gotta look after him."
00:21:04.137,00:21:07.557,We got 200 acres of fertile land. Imagine that.
00:21:12.688,00:21:14.898,-You're mighty quiet. -I'm mighty surprised.
00:21:19.152,00:21:20.612,-No. -I told ya.
00:21:20.696,00:21:22.948,"Henry, I had no idea."
00:21:23.031,00:21:24.700,-I'm-- -I would have remembered that.
00:21:28.954,00:21:30.747,"Well, I'm telling you now."
00:21:32.207,00:21:33.875,You're gonna love it.
00:21:35.210,00:21:36.962,You will. Wait and see.
00:21:39.840,00:21:40.924,Hmm?
00:22:58.126,00:23:00.211,Yeah? Who's gonna get which room?
00:23:00.295,00:23:02.088,"Come on, come on. Come on. You, too."
00:23:02.172,00:23:04.466,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You wait up there, huh?"
00:23:04.550,00:23:06.635,"You're gonna get the best room for yourself, huh?"
00:23:09.095,00:23:10.096,Huh?
00:23:12.683,00:23:16.812,There should be a key right under the mat.
00:23:21.692,00:23:22.943,We're the McAllans.
00:23:23.819,00:23:27.280,New tenants of this house. Who are you?
00:23:27.363,00:23:30.241,Orris Stokes. I'm the new owner of this house.
00:23:30.784,00:23:33.745,"Well, I rented this place off of George Suddeth just three weeks ago."
00:23:33.829,00:23:35.747,Suddeth sold me this house last week.
00:23:36.623,00:23:38.667,He didn't say nothing about no renters.
00:23:39.751,00:23:43.505,"Well, looks like I'm gonna have to refresh his memory, huh?"
00:23:43.589,00:23:45.924,-He left town three days ago. -I gave him a $100 deposit.
00:23:46.007,00:23:48.844,"-You get anything in writing? -No, Pappy, I shook on the deal."
00:23:49.886,00:23:53.098,"I gave him $100, cash, right there in the front room."
00:23:53.181,00:24:02.941,"Had dinner with him and his wife. I did. I showed him-- -Y'all best be getting on. -I showed him pictures of my little-- You got swindled, boy. Damn fool."
00:24:03.650,00:24:05.318,You damn fool.
00:24:06.361,00:24:09.823,Never thought a son of mine would be so damn stupid.
00:24:17.038,00:24:19.875,"Come on, we can stay on the farm. There's a house there."
00:24:19.958,00:24:21.042,We're gonna stay on the farm.
00:24:21.752,00:24:23.879,We can make it work. Come on.
00:24:27.132,00:24:29.760,"There's no place in town big enough for all of us, Pappy."
00:24:29.843,00:24:32.304,"Believe me, I checked. Huh? Come on, sugar."
00:25:13.511,00:25:16.682,got ahold of a piece of land down Reconstruction.
00:25:16.765,00:25:18.141,He had a deed.
00:25:18.224,00:25:22.395,"Four white men on horses rode up one day, aimed a pistol..."
00:25:23.230,00:25:24.606,said he was dead.
00:25:25.774,00:25:30.612,"My uncle's good deed, torn into 40 pieces and thrown to the wind."
00:25:33.406,00:25:36.952,"And so I ask, what good is a deed?"
00:25:44.835,00:25:48.797,"That mule made me a share tenant, not a sharecropper."
00:25:49.840,00:25:53.176,And had me dreaming about having my own piece of land.
00:25:54.595,00:25:56.346,Maybe that's where the problem started.
00:25:58.223,00:25:59.933,We're gonna be getting all your stenographer money.
00:26:00.016,00:26:04.854,"Nuh-uh. 'Cause I'mma be in California or Chicago, where all the good colored jobs at."
00:26:04.938,00:26:06.481,"-War gonna be over by then. -No, it won't."
00:26:10.318,00:26:13.780,-But Ronsel might be home early. -I don't want him home early.
00:26:14.739,00:26:16.700,-Early means-- -He ain't coming back early.
00:26:17.701,00:26:21.079,Y'all finish up. Get these dishes rinsed off before bed.
00:26:45.729,00:26:46.688,Howdy.
00:26:47.773,00:26:48.982,"Evenin', mister."
00:26:49.065,00:26:50.942,McAllan. Henry... Henry McAllan.
00:26:52.193,00:26:54.571,"-You're Hap Jackson. -Yes, sir."
00:26:55.488,00:26:57.907,"My family and I, we just arrived."
00:26:58.659,00:27:00.535,I'll need your help to unload.
00:27:00.618,00:27:02.453,-So you're the new owner? -I am.
00:27:02.537,00:27:04.289,Thought y'all weren't comin' until next week.
00:27:05.749,00:27:09.085,"Need to get unloaded, get a fire on before it gets dark."
00:27:12.130,00:27:13.381,Evenin'.
00:27:19.095,00:27:21.014,Then tell him to walk.
00:27:21.597,00:27:24.810,"It's too far, and we don't have time. It's getting late in the day."
00:27:24.893,00:27:26.686,I ain't movin' for no nigger.
00:27:29.439,00:27:32.943,"There's no room in the back of truck. Pappy, please."
00:27:51.962,00:27:55.048,he ain't know the eating end of a mule from the crappin' end.
00:27:58.551,00:28:02.638,Told me he intended to bring in one of them infernal tractors.
00:28:03.514,00:28:04.850,Imagine that.
00:28:06.434,00:28:09.980,Using a machine to work his land instead of the hands the Lord gave 'em.
00:28:16.402,00:28:19.364,You better get him to fix them shutters or we're gonna freeze to death.
00:28:24.660,00:28:25.703,Just leave it right here.
00:28:28.206,00:28:30.792,"You relax yourself there, Pappy. We'll take it."
00:28:30.876,00:28:33.294,Girls are done in. I need their blankets.
00:28:35.839,00:28:37.966,There has to be some in here somewhere.
00:28:38.842,00:28:40.260,"All right, girls, come on."
00:28:47.225,00:28:51.354,A Tale of Two Cities.
00:28:51.980,00:28:53.231,Wuthering...
00:28:53.314,00:28:54.149,You can read?
00:28:55.150,00:28:56.818,My son Ronsel taught me.
00:28:56.902,00:28:59.070,He gonna be fightin' under General Patton.
00:28:59.154,00:29:01.865,You mean diggin' ditches and peelin' potatoes?
00:29:01.948,00:29:03.825,"No, sir, he a tank commander."
00:29:03.909,00:29:08.872,"Oh, there's no way the army's gonna turn a tank worth thousands of dollars over to a nigger."
00:29:09.455,00:29:11.541,"Now my son Jamie, now there's a fighting man."
00:29:14.460,00:29:18.339,"Uh, my son's a sergeant. 761st Battalion."
00:29:18.423,00:29:19.883,Calls 'em the Black Panthers.
00:29:22.260,00:29:23.386,Boy.
00:29:23.469,00:29:26.056,You know what they call a nigger with stripes?
00:29:35.648,00:29:37.650,Ain't no room for that piano. Where am I gonna sleep?
00:29:37.733,00:29:38.985,We'll have to put you in the lean-to.
00:29:44.950,00:29:48.411,we can put a bed right there. Put a curtain around it.
00:29:48.494,00:29:49.704,"It's true, we could."
00:29:49.788,00:29:51.622,I don't want a bedroom in the living room.
00:29:51.706,00:29:52.874,She puttin' me out.
00:29:52.958,00:29:55.501,"-We're not puttin' you out. -Henry, may I speak to you in private?"
00:29:55.585,00:29:57.087,-Honey! Not puttin' you out. -Henry.
00:29:57.170,00:30:01.091,"When you told me that you were bringin' me to this godforsaken place, I barely said a word."
00:30:01.174,00:30:03.551,"When you informed me he was comin' to live with us, I went along."
00:30:03.634,00:30:07.847,"And when Orris Stokes told you you'd been fleeced by that man you rented the house from, I kept my mouth shut."
00:30:08.389,00:30:10.975,"But I am tellin' you now, we are not gettin' rid of that piano."
00:30:11.059,00:30:13.311,It's the one civilized thing in this place.
00:30:13.394,00:30:18.108,"So your father can either sleep in the lean-to or in the bed with you, because I'm not stayin' here without my piano."
00:30:18.191,00:30:19.818,You know what? You're overtired.
00:30:19.901,00:30:21.152,"No, I'm not."
00:30:34.249,00:30:36.876,and his slaves built the farm that I grew up on.
00:30:38.628,00:30:43.424,"One time, my granddaddy told me to go out, grab a handful of dirt from the yard and bring it in."
00:30:44.384,00:30:47.512,"He said, What are you holdin', son? And I said, Dirt."
00:30:48.179,00:30:50.014,That's right. Now give it to me.
00:30:50.765,00:30:53.977,"So I did, and he says, Now what's this I've got in my hand?"
00:30:55.270,00:30:56.396,"Dirt, I says."
00:30:56.980,00:30:59.774,"No, boy, this is land that I've gotten. Do you know why?"
00:31:01.526,00:31:04.988,Because I own it. Because it's mine.
00:31:05.655,00:31:07.156,"And one day, it'll be yours."
00:31:08.449,00:31:10.869,Except that land never became mine.
00:31:10.952,00:31:13.246,"No, Pappy sold it after the flood."
00:31:14.539,00:31:16.875,He told people that the river wiped him out.
00:31:18.043,00:31:19.627,But that was just a lie.
00:31:21.171,00:31:23.714,He walked away from that land gladly.
00:31:40.106,00:31:42.483,The army made Jamie a bomber pilot.
00:31:43.484,00:31:45.361,It was my fault that he's up there.
00:31:46.362,00:31:50.825,"I made him promise if he ever had to be a soldier, he would get up to the sky."
00:31:51.867,00:31:54.287,They say battle is cleaner up there.
00:32:09.177,00:32:13.098,Missed my daughter's birthday. She's not too happy about that.
00:32:13.723,00:32:16.642,"We'll get back soon. I'll get you back safe, Rog."
00:32:16.726,00:32:18.603,"All right, I'll hold you to that."
00:32:19.228,00:32:21.731,You got your pinup girl. I got mine.
00:32:22.315,00:32:24.275,"Yeah, but mine's from a magazine."
00:32:33.868,00:32:37.705,I'm writing you from a village in Belgium called Tillet.
00:32:39.958,00:32:43.503,"Belgium is a country just north of France, and it's beautiful."
00:32:44.170,00:32:47.799,Daddy would like it around here. There's lots of farms.
00:32:54.097,00:32:56.057,I'll probably be long gone from here.
00:32:57.058,00:32:59.269,We always seem to be on the move.
00:33:19.039,00:33:23.584,"-What kind of man shoots his horse, Carl? -Someone-- -Can't even get his feeding on time. -My horse ate my tobacco!"
00:33:23.668,00:33:25.670,"-It's my property! -Carl, I've heard enough, okay?"
00:33:25.753,00:33:26.921,I don't wanna hear no more!
00:33:27.005,00:33:29.590,"Okay? If you can't do your job, I can't keep you on!"
00:33:29.674,00:33:31.051,"-Henry, no. -Now, you know that!"
00:33:31.134,00:33:35.305,"Henry. Henry, I got-- Please. I got Vera and the girls and I got one on the way!"
00:33:35.388,00:33:38.266,"-I mean-- -Man, I got-- I got a wife. I got kids, Carl."
00:33:41.602,00:33:42.895,"I'm runnin' a farm, not a charity."
00:33:42.978,00:33:44.939,-You got till the end of the week! -Please!
00:33:46.982,00:33:48.443,Then I want you gone!
00:34:30.943,00:34:33.613,You're forever being assailed by dead things.
00:34:36.657,00:34:41.621,"Dead mice, dead rabbits, dead possums."
00:34:42.288,00:34:43.789,You find them in the yard.
00:34:44.373,00:34:46.667,You smell them rottin' under the house.
00:34:47.543,00:34:49.796,And then there are the creatures you kill for food.
00:34:50.546,00:34:56.511,"Chickens, hogs, deer, frogs, squirrels."
00:34:57.178,00:35:03.393,"Pluck, skin, disembowel, debone, fry."
00:35:04.894,00:35:07.647,"Eat, start again, kill."
00:35:10.775,00:35:13.194,I learned how to stitch up a bleeding wound...
00:35:13.861,00:35:15.738,load and fire a shotgun...
00:35:16.572,00:35:20.284,reach into the womb of a heavin' sow to deliver a breeched piglet.
00:35:21.994,00:35:23.746,My hands did these things...
00:35:24.789,00:35:26.666,but I was never easy in my mind.
00:35:32.505,00:35:34.006,"Howdy, Mrs. McAllan."
00:35:36.008,00:35:37.677,"Hello, Miss..."
00:35:37.760,00:35:40.305,Vera. You can call me Vera.
00:35:40.930,00:35:42.140,"Hello, Vera."
00:35:42.223,00:35:44.142,"This here's one of my daughters, Alma."
00:35:46.269,00:35:48.062,We need to talk to you.
00:36:10.418,00:36:12.127,You can't put us off.
00:36:13.087,00:36:14.004,Excuse me?
00:36:14.088,00:36:16.382,We ain't got nowhere to go if you put us out.
00:36:16.882,00:36:19.344,Ain't nobody gonna hire us this late in the season.
00:36:20.845,00:36:23.723,"It's not up to me, Vera. It's up to my husband."
00:36:23.806,00:36:26.100,I'm asking you to keep us on.
00:36:26.184,00:36:28.477,I'm tellin' you it's not my decision.
00:36:31.189,00:36:32.773,And if it was?
00:37:02.637,00:37:04.680,The locals treat us real nice.
00:37:05.890,00:37:08.393,They ain't like the white folks back home.
00:37:10.519,00:37:11.896,I get homesick.
00:37:12.563,00:37:16.025,And they do all they can to make us feel right at home.
00:37:17.777,00:37:19.279,I'm mighty grateful for that.
00:37:20.655,00:37:21.906,Ronsel.
00:37:38.881,00:37:39.882,Henry!
00:37:41.426,00:37:43.594,"-What? -Henry, your wife wants you."
00:37:43.678,00:37:47.181,"Isabelle's sick and the other one's comin' down with it, too."
00:37:51.143,00:37:54.021,It's whooping cough. Go get the doctor.
00:37:54.104,00:37:56.482,And tell your father to put water on to boil.
00:37:57.400,00:37:58.526,"Henry, go!"
00:37:59.068,00:38:00.027,Go!
00:38:24.218,00:38:28.973,Her dress was so glitty... glittery.
00:38:29.640,00:38:34.061,Even the white GI's couldn't take their eyes off her.
00:38:34.729,00:38:59.378,"Tell Lilly May Tell Marlon I tried to save him some snow, but it melted."
00:39:08.554,00:39:09.472,And...
00:39:19.565,00:39:21.817,"Hap, I need your wife. I need Florence."
00:39:21.901,00:39:26.697,"My girls are comin' down sick with a whooping cough, and I can't get to town on account of the bridge been washed out."
00:39:26.781,00:39:28.741,I remember you said she was a midwife.
00:39:28.824,00:39:39.835,"-My wife ain't no doctor, sir. -I realize that, Hap, but my wife needs some help and I thought-- -When did they start the whooping? -Isabelle started a couple of days ago and Amanda Leigh started coughing a few hours back."
00:39:39.919,00:39:40.878,They still catching.
00:39:40.961,00:39:43.964,"She can get you some remedies to take, but she can't go with you, sir."
00:39:44.757,00:39:45.800,I can pay you.
00:39:47.468,00:39:49.762,I won't be able to come home for about three or four days.
00:39:49.845,00:39:52.056,-Who's gonna look after my own family? -Please.
00:39:52.139,00:39:53.933,My wife is afraid.
00:40:10.658,00:40:13.661,"My own mother, I remember being blue."
00:40:14.703,00:40:16.414,Blue from the dark of the mornin'.
00:40:17.206,00:40:23.212,"When the moon would still be up, she kissin' me and my sisters on the eyelids, us pretendin' to be asleep."
00:40:24.505,00:40:26.215,She goin' off to work...
00:40:27.133,00:40:29.969,to wake and kiss some other woman's children in the sunlight.
00:40:30.595,00:40:33.764,I swore that my own children would have all of me.
00:40:38.769,00:40:39.687,She's a midwife.
00:40:39.770,00:40:42.231,-Do you see anybody giving birth here? -The bridge is washed out.
00:40:42.314,00:40:44.859,-She might be able to help. -The girls need a doctor-- Damn bridge is flooded.
00:40:44.942,00:40:46.486,-What do you want me to do? -Take her.
00:40:52.742,00:40:54.785,I've seen this with my own children.
00:40:56.871,00:40:59.499,But first we gotta clear out some of this phlegm.
00:40:59.582,00:41:02.042,And that's real good you makin' that steam for 'em.
00:41:02.668,00:41:04.962,"Mr. McAllan, would you kindly boil some more water, sir."
00:41:09.258,00:41:12.052,I should've taken them to the doctor as soon as they started coughing.
00:41:19.143,00:41:20.520,Your girls are gonna be just fine.
00:41:20.603,00:41:21.812,Okay.
00:41:26.191,00:41:28.193,that would have been the end of us.
00:41:29.862,00:41:33.574,Now I know that she left us not just out of duty...
00:41:37.119,00:41:46.086,"Do you hear me, gal? I want some damn-- -...I will slap the piss out of you. -...that love is a kind of survival."
00:42:21.330,00:42:23.082,"Front gunner, are you up there?"
00:42:43.227,00:42:44.228,"Oh, no!"
00:43:19.722,00:43:21.599,Glad to see you feelin' better.
00:43:28.022,00:43:29.732,We'd like to offer you a job.
00:43:30.316,00:43:31.567,Workin' here for me.
00:43:32.442,00:43:33.986,I'll need help with the girls.
00:43:34.069,00:43:36.113,"Cookin', cleanin', that sort of thing."
00:43:38.115,00:43:40.618,It means extra money for you and your family.
00:43:47.917,00:43:51.754,"We pay rent, work our crops for us. That's it."
00:43:51.837,00:43:54.048,"They can't just pick us up, set us down like we tools."
00:43:54.715,00:43:59.970,"You're the one always talkin' about saving, how owning our own parcel the only way to get out from under their foot."
00:44:00.054,00:44:03.015,-We right there. -I don't want you workin' for them.
00:44:03.098,00:44:06.060,I won't be workin' for them. I'd be workin' for us.
00:44:06.143,00:44:07.811,I already said yes.
00:44:10.690,00:44:14.694,"For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church."
00:44:14.777,00:44:18.072,"An excellent wife, who can find?"
00:44:18.155,00:44:19.990,She's more precious than jewels.
00:44:20.074,00:44:24.203,"Her husband trust in her, and he will have no lack of gain."
00:44:26.914,00:44:28.457,All those Sundays.
00:44:29.875,00:44:32.795,"-You really are listenin', huh? -Yes."
00:44:32.878,00:44:35.130,And now you must listen to me.
00:44:43.513,00:44:45.975,In my father's house are many mansions.
00:44:47.226,00:44:50.229,"I know that to be so. If it wasn't so, I would've told you."
00:44:51.856,00:44:53.983,I go to prepare a place for you.
00:44:55.484,00:44:59.071,"That where I am, ye may be also."
00:45:04.701,00:45:06.912,It brings me comfort to know that...
00:45:07.830,00:45:11.416,"one day, my getting up gonna be just a little bit easier than it was the day before."
00:45:15.504,00:45:17.714,my children ain't gonna wake up to this place.
00:45:18.841,00:45:21.593,They gonna open their eyes up on a new sky.
00:45:22.845,00:45:30.060,"One mornin', we're gonna break this boot from 'round our neck and shake these chains from 'rounds our feets."
00:45:33.105,00:45:36.233,And I ain't talkin' about the hereafter. I'm talkin' about the right now.
00:45:40.487,00:45:41.655,I said...
00:46:34.208,00:46:35.125,Fire!
00:46:42.507,00:46:44.885,Out of the tank! Out of the tank!
00:46:47.972,00:46:52.434,"Out, out, out! Out of the tank! Out of the tank!"
00:47:01.902,00:47:04.154,Move! Move! Move! Get down!
00:47:05.823,00:47:08.450,I need a medic! I need a medic!
00:47:58.375,00:48:02.004,Laid in that bed knowing my wife out doin' my work for me.
00:48:04.048,00:48:06.341,Florence's hands all blistered up.
00:48:08.135,00:48:11.513,And I seen her rubbin' her back when she thought I wasn't lookin'.
00:48:37.789,00:48:41.043,"A big, hard rain that packed the fields tight as wax."
00:48:48.759,00:48:49.885,Nothin' we could do.
00:48:51.261,00:48:56.558,"Sat there, watchin' and frettin' for two days till it finally cleared up."
00:49:28.465,00:49:29.674,"Yes, sir."
00:49:34.596,00:49:37.432,"-How you feelin'? -Gettin' better by the day, sir."
00:49:38.350,00:49:40.435,"Well, you look like you know what you're doing there."
00:49:41.270,00:49:42.646,Family tradition.
00:49:42.729,00:49:45.232,How much longer you reckon you're gonna be laid up for?
00:49:46.025,00:49:49.486,"Oh, well, Doc Turpin says six weeks. It's already been four."
00:49:49.569,00:49:51.238,I bet I'll be out there by Monday.
00:49:51.780,00:49:54.199,"-Monday, you reckon? Well... -Yes, sir."
00:49:56.952,00:50:00.330,I don't think you're gonna get everythin' in the ground on time.
00:50:01.831,00:50:03.292,You're cuttin' it close.
00:50:08.838,00:50:11.883,And you know field needs to be rebroke 'cause of that rain.
00:50:19.058,00:50:21.101,and you haven't even gotten your fields laid by.
00:50:22.561,00:50:26.356,"Can't afford to wait any longer, Hap. You're a farmer. You understand that."
00:50:27.023,00:50:28.358,"Yes, sir."
00:50:30.110,00:50:31.570,"Of course, if you had a mule..."
00:50:33.530,00:50:35.115,you'd be done in no time.
00:50:36.658,00:50:39.453,"-We lost that mule to lockjaw, sir. -I know."
00:50:40.704,00:50:43.999,"Florence and the boys out there-- You're gonna have to rent one of my mules, Hap."
00:50:44.916,00:50:47.002,You'll go on half shares till you pay it off.
00:50:51.465,00:50:54.134,Send one of your boys around after dinner to fetch that mule.
00:50:55.760,00:50:57.011,"Yes, sir."
00:52:55.922,00:52:57.924,Florence ain't gonna be able to work with us for a while.
00:52:58.007,00:53:00.176,What do you mean Florence isn't comin' back?
00:53:00.260,00:53:04.055,"Well, not till the end of July, anyways. Until we get the seed in the ground."
00:53:04.138,00:53:07.559,-Where's Hap? -Hap broke his leg. I told ya.
00:53:07.642,00:53:08.768,-No. -I did.
00:53:08.852,00:53:10.019,"-You didn't, Henry. -I did."
00:53:10.103,00:53:15.108,"I need help with the girls. Can't you lend them a mule-- No, I can't lend him a mule."
00:53:15.191,00:53:16.818,You don't just lend somebody a mule.
00:53:17.277,00:53:20.238,Why don't I just give 'em the whole farm while I'm at it?
00:53:22.366,00:53:28.288,"I mean, if they can't get the seed in the ground in time, they need to rent one of ours, and they can pay us a half share for it."
00:53:28.372,00:53:30.624,"It's tough on them, but it's good for us."
00:53:30.707,00:53:32.083,Hap hurt himself working for us.
00:53:32.166,00:53:35.670,"No, Laura, Hap Jackson hurt himself workin' for Hap Jackson."
00:53:35.754,00:53:41.676,"-Farming's a business. -I just think-- You just think. Well, I just sank everything we have into this farm."
00:53:41.760,00:53:42.719,Everything.
00:53:43.345,00:53:47.098,"We need to make some money this year, or our family's in trouble."
00:53:48.266,00:53:49.684,"Now, do you understand that?"
00:53:53.438,00:53:54.356,Do you?
00:53:55.148,00:53:56.232,"Yes, Henry."
00:53:57.942,00:54:00.362,"All right, then. Hmm? Come on."
00:54:10.789,00:54:14.918,The date the Confederate forces crushed the Union army in the Battle of Richmond.
00:54:16.252,00:54:19.172,I don't think he knew that I knew the combination.
00:54:24.886,00:54:28.473,-Hello. Mrs. Jackson? -Yes?
00:54:28.556,00:54:32.852,I'm Dr. Pearlman. I'm here to treat your husband.
00:54:33.437,00:54:37.148,"Oh, thank you. Come in."
00:54:46.616,00:54:48.994,I'd have told you all white folks was the same.
00:55:08.096,00:55:10.473,and he showed it by ignoring me in our bed.
00:55:13.142,00:55:18.147,"I hadn't always enjoyed Henry's lovemaking, but it made me feel like a true wife."
00:55:39.878,00:55:41.505,How could he refuse me?
00:55:52.349,00:55:54.809,General Eisenhower informs me...
00:55:55.309,00:56:00.399,that the forces of Germany have surrendered to the United Nations.
00:56:01.149,00:56:04.861,The flags of freedom fly all over Europe.
00:56:06.279,00:56:14.245,"For this victory, we join in offering our thanks to the providence which has guided and sustained us..."
00:57:22.814,00:57:24.398,Boom!
00:57:24.483,00:57:26.901,We're in enemy territory. We're in enemy territory.
00:57:26.985,00:57:29.488,"You dead, cracker, you dead!"
00:57:31.490,00:57:33.908,"We're runnin' over 'em. Watch your right, gunner."
00:57:48.131,00:57:49.132,Bang!
00:57:50.174,00:57:51.009,You dead.
00:58:03.688,00:58:06.525,It was the only day I felt truly clean.
00:58:09.944,00:58:13.490,"The rest of the time, we stank."
00:59:03.957,00:59:05.959,"Mama, somebody's coming!"
00:59:18.304,00:59:20.765,-Oh! Give your Uncle Jamie a hug! -Jamie! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:59:26.605,00:59:27.814,"Come on, girls."
00:59:30.441,00:59:31.818,"You look good, brother."
00:59:32.277,00:59:33.653,You look like hell.
00:59:34.278,00:59:36.489,-Don't sugarcoat it now. -Don't sugarcoat it. Come on!
00:59:37.323,00:59:38.407,Huh?
00:59:53.006,00:59:55.592,How you enjoyin' it here in Henry's version of paradise?
00:59:56.593,01:00:00.179,You'd think a son would see fit to say hello to his own father.
01:00:03.683,01:00:06.310,"He's missed you, too, though he won't admit it."
01:00:08.104,01:00:13.401,"Yeah. Well, I bet he's quit chewing chaw and joined the NAACP, too."
01:00:17.614,01:00:19.573,"Come on, I can't believe you walked out here!"
01:00:19.658,01:00:20.742,Well...
01:00:21.701,01:00:23.662,I didn't wanna bother you guys.
01:00:23.745,01:00:25.038,"It's, uh..."
01:00:32.170,01:00:35.173,That's the last thing that she said.
01:00:38.009,01:00:39.218,Boy!
01:00:41.429,01:00:42.889,"Oh, boy."
01:00:42.972,01:00:46.100,"So, what's it like being a big war hero?"
01:00:49.646,01:00:51.898,Army wrote me letters about your fancy medals.
01:00:51.981,01:00:55.443,Said it was the highest honor an airman could achieve.
01:00:59.739,01:01:01.199,I was lucky.
01:01:04.911,01:01:07.831,"I bet you got plenty of tail out if it, too."
01:01:07.914,01:01:10.750,"Oh, Jamie never needed medals to get girls, Pappy."
01:01:14.253,01:01:17.506,Your mama was the prettiest girl in Greenville.
01:01:17.590,01:01:20.885,And I had 'em all sniffing up after me.
01:01:23.262,01:01:25.932,Yeah. I'll tell you one thing for sure.
01:01:27.266,01:01:32.188,You had to kill a whole lot of Krauts to get them medals.
01:01:32.271,01:01:35.692,"How many did you take out, you reckon? Fifty? Fifty? A hundred?"
01:01:40.071,01:01:41.322,I don't know.
01:01:41.906,01:01:43.867,What... What's the matter?
01:01:43.950,01:01:46.660,Man ought to know how many men he's killed.
01:01:51.582,01:01:52.541,Well...
01:01:54.460,01:01:55.920,I'll tell you one thing.
01:02:02.051,01:02:03.970,It was more than one.
01:02:12.645,01:02:13.855,"Well, son..."
01:02:15.648,01:02:20.069,at least I looked my one in the eye before I shot him.
01:02:22.696,01:02:25.992,Not like dropping bombs from a mile up in the air.
01:02:40.173,01:02:41.590,He's just proud of you.
01:02:46.846,01:02:48.973,"-Yeah. -Got a point, though."
01:02:49.057,01:02:50.558,We should hit the hay.
01:02:51.350,01:02:52.977,You'll be okay on the couch?
01:02:58.649,01:02:59.733,Come on.
01:03:05.406,01:03:07.366,"Good to see you, little brother."
01:03:08.785,01:03:11.037,Appreciate you and Laura for having me.
01:03:14.498,01:03:15.749,You need a good night's sleep.
01:03:17.418,01:03:20.797,Feed you up. Get some meat on those bones.
01:03:20.880,01:03:22.298,"Actually, it was more like four."
01:03:24.008,01:03:25.134,Four what?
01:03:26.677,01:03:30.639,Miles up in the air. The altitude we dropped those bombs from.
01:03:31.390,01:03:33.643,The hell you even see anything that high up?
01:03:34.602,01:03:36.145,You'd be surprised.
01:03:36.896,01:03:38.898,"Roads, cities, factories."
01:03:40.441,01:03:41.860,Just not people.
01:03:44.612,01:03:47.156,"20,000 feet, they ain't even ants."
01:03:51.828,01:03:53.246,Pappy's right.
01:03:55.456,01:03:56.958,Man ought to know.
01:04:35.914,01:04:39.959,"Tupelo! Next stop, Tupelo!"
01:04:50.970,01:04:54.765,Went off to fight for my country to come back and find it hadn't changed a bit.
01:05:08.071,01:05:09.488,Thank you.
01:05:17.246,01:05:18.622,"Howdy, Miss Tricklebank."
01:05:18.706,01:05:21.542,Ronsel... is that you?
01:05:21.625,01:05:23.377,"Yes, ma'am, it is, last time I checked."
01:05:23.461,01:05:26.047,"Oh, I declare, aren't you grown up! How are ya?"
01:05:26.130,01:05:28.424,I am mighty fine. How've you been?
01:05:28.507,01:05:31.219,"Oh, I'm getting' along fine. I'm getting along fine."
01:05:31.302,01:05:32.345,You seen your folks yet?
01:05:32.428,01:05:36.515,"No, I just wanted to stop by and get 'em a couple of things before I went home."
01:05:37.183,01:05:41.187,"Hello, Ronsel. I'm Mrs. McAllan. Your parents work on our farm."
01:05:41.270,01:05:42.271,"How you do, ma'am?"
01:05:44.565,01:05:46.525,I know they'll be mighty glad to see you.
01:05:47.151,01:05:48.236,Is that everything?
01:05:48.319,01:05:55.201,"Oh, no. Uh, I just needed to get some sugar and some candy."
01:05:55.576,01:05:56.702,Sugar and candy?
01:05:56.785,01:06:00.706,"Yes. The sugar's for my mama, and the candy's for Marlon and Lilly May."
01:06:02.833,01:06:05.836,-Sergeant's pay. -I'm sure they'll appreciate that.
01:06:05.919,01:06:07.005,"Yes, ma'am."
01:06:09.006,01:06:11.175,You have a great day. Mrs. McAllan.
01:06:14.303,01:06:17.765,Look what we got here. A jig in a uniform.
01:06:20.434,01:06:22.186,"Where do you think you're goin', boy?"
01:06:22.979,01:06:25.773,"I beg your pardon, sir. I'm just tryin' to get home to see my folks."
01:06:28.651,01:06:30.903,Hap and Florence's son. Just returned from overseas.
01:06:30.987,01:06:32.405,"Oh, oh!"
01:06:32.488,01:06:36.242,"Well, that explains why you're tryin' to leave by the front door."
01:06:36.325,01:06:39.328,You must be confused as to your whereabouts.
01:06:39.412,01:06:43.166,"-No, sir, I'm not confused at all. -Oh, I think you are, boy."
01:06:43.749,01:06:48.838,"I don't know what they let you do over there, but you're in Mississippi now, nigger."
01:06:49.505,01:06:51.257,You use the back door.
01:06:54.468,01:06:58.222,"Go on, son. Son, we don't want no trouble here. Go on."
01:06:58.806,01:07:00.016,Go on.
01:07:01.350,01:07:03.061,You know what? You're absolutely right.
01:07:03.144,01:07:07.065,"When we was overseas, they didn't make us use the back door."
01:07:07.148,01:07:09.942,General Patton put us on the front line.
01:07:10.568,01:07:13.112,"Yes, sir. You know what we did?"
01:07:14.655,01:07:17.575,We kicked the hell out of Hitler and them Jerries.
01:07:19.827,01:07:22.080,While y'all at home safe and sound.
01:07:43.684,01:07:46.312,"from thy bounty through Christ, our Lord and savior."
01:07:46.395,01:07:52.568,"And, Lord, thank you for the sun you've been sending to make the cotton grow, and for the health of all here present."
01:07:53.277,01:08:00.033,"And, Lord Jesus, please watch over my boy Ronsel, wherever in creation he may be."
01:08:15.091,01:08:17.135,"Oh, look at you. You're so grown."
01:08:21.180,01:08:24.141,"Oh, Marlon, look at you. You about my size. You shot up, huh?"
01:08:24.975,01:08:26.810,-What'd you get them medals for? -How was the trip home?
01:08:31.940,01:08:33.817,and let him come say hello to his father.
01:08:55.047,01:08:57.925,I knew you'd come. I prayed for it.
01:09:03.347,01:09:04.348,Look at you.
01:09:16.819,01:09:19.029,What in the devil happened to you?
01:09:21.907,01:09:23.867,"Mom, I brought you some groceries."
01:09:23.951,01:09:25.203,"Oh, thank you, baby."
01:09:34.002,01:09:35.838,"-Want some rice? -Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:09:55.816,01:09:57.651,"Well, a lot's changed, Pop."
01:10:09.162,01:10:11.039,"Yeah, I dreamt about you, too."
01:10:15.002,01:10:16.086,What'd you see?
01:10:18.631,01:10:21.383,"You back with us now, safe and sound."
01:10:24.553,01:10:27.765,"With you home, we might can make up what we lost after my accident."
01:10:27.848,01:10:31.477,"Pay off the lien, get a new contract, go back to being tenants next year."
01:10:31.560,01:10:35.105,"Maybe he got plans of his own. Let him follow his own mind, Hap."
01:10:35.188,01:10:36.357,"No, no, Mama."
01:10:38.317,01:10:40.403,"Yes, of course, I'll stay."
01:10:41.445,01:10:42.530,Of course.
01:10:44.448,01:10:48.494,Give me time to figure things out and put this war behind me.
01:11:07.596,01:11:09.056,"Evening, Mr. McAllan."
01:11:09.139,01:11:11.975,"Evening, Hap. Florence."
01:11:13.018,01:11:15.938,This our son Ronsel I told you about.
01:11:18.899,01:11:21.944,"-Hap, I'd better speak to you alone. -Huh."
01:11:23.779,01:11:25.072,"I'm not a child, sir."
01:11:26.073,01:11:28.867,"Anything you can say to my daddy, you can say in front of me."
01:11:35.833,01:11:38.669,acting the way you did at Tricklebank's earlier.
01:11:40.045,01:11:42.172,"Now, I know you don't want that kinda trouble."
01:11:42.923,01:11:46.134,"Not for yourself, or for your family."
01:11:46.218,01:11:47.845,"Boy, what'd you do?"
01:11:48.929,01:11:50.306,He couldn't have done anything.
01:11:50.389,01:11:54.017,-I just tried to walk out the door is all. -The front door.
01:11:56.645,01:11:59.106,"When my father and another man corrected him, he gave a fine speech."
01:11:59.189,01:12:01.233,"Put us all in our places, didn't you?"
01:12:04.277,01:12:05.529,Is that true?
01:12:09.742,01:12:11.869,Then I reckon you best apologize.
01:12:15.038,01:12:16.499,"I'm sorry, sir."
01:12:27.801,01:12:28.635,All right.
01:12:30.804,01:12:32.473,"My father's gonna want an apology, too."
01:12:32.556,01:12:34.892,"Ronsel will pay him a visit after church tomorrow, sir."
01:12:35.434,01:12:36.643,"Won't you, son?"
01:12:37.185,01:12:38.396,"Yes, sir."
01:12:42.525,01:12:44.693,"-Welcome home. -Thank you, sir."
01:12:52.451,01:12:56.246,No point in fightin'. They just gonna win every time.
01:13:01.209,01:13:04.588,"Just not used to walking away from a fight, Daddy, that's all."
01:13:06.424,01:13:07.800,Not no more.
01:13:16.767,01:13:18.477,"Oh, just couple of weeks."
01:13:18.561,01:13:20.563,Mm-hmm. And how are you liking Marietta?
01:13:20.646,01:13:23.023,"Oh, it's a lovely little town. Just lovely."
01:13:23.941,01:13:27.069,"Oh, I got that one right there. Put that there."
01:13:27.152,01:13:29.822,"Much obliged, Miss Tricklebank. You have yourself a wonderful day."
01:13:29.905,01:13:30.906,-Take care. -Yeah.
01:13:54.555,01:13:57.933,It's just a car. It must've backfired. Stuck intake valve.
01:14:13.115,01:14:14.867,They say it stops eventually.
01:14:20.456,01:14:22.750,You're Ronsel. Hap's son.
01:14:24.585,01:14:26.253,Jamie McAllan. Henry's Brother.
01:14:27.129,01:14:28.464,Pleasure to meet you.
01:14:33.218,01:14:34.178,You walk here?
01:14:34.970,01:14:35.971,Yes.
01:14:36.388,01:14:37.681,Let me give you a lift.
01:14:39.933,01:14:41.059,Come on.
01:15:14.968,01:15:16.845,for the 15th Annual All-Star Game.
01:15:17.888,01:15:21.058,-Come on up front! -I'm fine right where I am.
01:15:21.809,01:15:23.769,"Get in, soldier. That's an order."
01:15:25.854,01:15:29.149,"John Mize, Walker Cooper, Ralph Kiner and Stan Musial."
01:15:30.358,01:15:36.031,"The American League pioneers, Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, George Kell and Lou Boudreau."
01:15:40.118,01:15:43.080,-How'd you know you outrank me? -I was a captain.
01:15:44.414,01:15:47.084,They got Negro captains. I served under plenty of 'em.
01:15:48.460,01:15:53.465,"Well, you obeyed my order. I bet you was a sergeant."
01:15:54.424,01:15:56.468,761st Tank Battalion.
01:15:57.761,01:15:59.012,Come Out Fighting.
01:16:01.431,01:16:03.475,We spearheaded for General Patton.
01:16:04.935,01:16:06.144,You?
01:16:07.437,01:16:09.147,I flew B-25s.
01:16:10.315,01:16:12.985,"So, Sergeant, how do you like being back here in the delta?"
01:16:20.033,01:16:21.577,"Yeah, me, too."
01:16:22.535,01:16:25.205,-Heard you and my pappy had some words. -I apologized for that.
01:16:25.289,01:16:28.333,He's a disagreeable son of a bitch. I'm sure he had it coming.
01:16:30.961,01:16:34.047,"-Here's to you. -I'm fine, thank you."
01:16:34.882,01:16:38.761,"Boy, you always this stubborn, or just around white people tryin' to be nice?"
01:16:42.806,01:16:43.891,Go on.
01:16:51.356,01:16:53.817,"Now, what kind of NCO are you?"
01:17:03.702,01:17:04.703,I need every drop.
01:17:10.125,01:17:12.670,You tanker boys ever piss in your helmets?
01:17:14.963,01:17:18.300,-Plenty of times. -We had a relief tube up in the cockpit.
01:17:19.092,01:17:22.137,Sometimes it was easier just to go in our flak helmets.
01:17:22.220,01:17:26.892,"But at 20,000 feet, that piss freezes solid in less than a minute."
01:17:29.061,01:17:30.771,It's that cold up there?
01:17:31.438,01:17:34.817,"Shit. I'm talking 20, 30 below."
01:17:34.900,01:17:39.321,"One time we were on this long haul, I pissed in my helmet, I forgot all about it."
01:17:39.404,01:17:42.783,We were just over the target. I put the helmet back on.
01:17:42.866,01:17:54.670,"We're doing this bombing run, dodgin' enemy flak, I smelled like a damn latrine."
01:17:56.672,01:17:59.800,"Yeah, you must've caught hell back at that officer's club, too."
01:17:59.883,01:18:02.094,"Boy, my friends never let me hear the end of it."
01:18:03.053,01:18:05.180,"The ones that made it back, anyway."
01:18:08.350,01:18:10.518,"Yeah, I lost some friends, too."
01:18:13.480,01:18:14.564,"Well, here's to them."
01:18:25.826,01:18:29.662,I wouldn't get home until...
01:18:42.425,01:18:45.929,"-Everythin' all right, Mr. Jamie? -Oh, everything's just fine."
01:18:46.013,01:18:48.766,Just gave Ronsel here a little lift from town.
01:18:50.893,01:18:53.979,I'll be heading back to town next Saturday afternoon.
01:18:54.062,01:18:56.606,"If you like, I'll stop by here and see if you want a ride."
01:18:57.733,01:18:58.984,That'd be fine.
01:19:00.193,01:19:01.028,"Well, all right."
01:19:02.112,01:19:03.196,Hap.
01:20:00.628,01:20:02.130,"I got you somethin', Mom."
01:20:03.590,01:20:04.591,Oh.
01:20:06.509,01:20:08.053,This is so much.
01:20:09.096,01:20:11.264,I'll save it for your brother and sister. They'll love it.
01:20:11.348,01:20:12.265,No.
01:20:13.141,01:20:15.560,"-I got it for you. -Oh, baby, I can't."
01:20:16.937,01:20:18.521,I'm gonna watch you eat it.
01:20:31.618,01:20:32.953,Mm-hmm.
01:20:36.248,01:20:37.457,"Thank you, son."
01:20:39.792,01:20:42.838,"Finish it, Mom. Don't save it. Don't save it, Mom."
01:20:44.672,01:20:47.467,I better not see Lilly May or Marlon with none of that.
01:20:47.550,01:20:48.801,All right.
01:20:52.222,01:20:53.640,I love you.
01:20:53.723,01:20:55.225,"I love you, too, sweetie."
01:20:58.937,01:20:59.980,Thank you.
01:21:06.778,01:21:07.737,I tried.
01:21:17.122,01:21:18.415,I can't...
01:21:20.042,01:21:21.501,I can't swim.
01:21:23.795,01:21:25.005,"Oh, God."
01:21:27.424,01:21:28.926,"Oh, God."
01:21:30.468,01:21:31.929,"Oh, my God."
01:21:33.638,01:21:37.392,Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Jamie. It's okay. It's okay.
01:21:57.579,01:21:59.623,"No, I can't."
01:22:00.373,01:22:01.666,-Jamie. -I gotta go.
01:22:20.893,01:22:22.354,Henry was away.
01:22:24.022,01:22:28.109,"He and Pappy had gone to see about some hogs, so I was alone with the girls."
01:22:40.121,01:22:41.081,Vera?
01:22:43.375,01:22:45.085,You need to take me to town.
01:22:46.503,01:22:48.421,I'm gonna kill Carl.
01:22:51.508,01:22:56.179,"Vera, why don't you come and sit down and we'll talk-- I don't have time to sit down."
01:22:56.972,01:22:58.806,He's with her now.
01:22:59.265,01:23:01.935,"Started in on Alma, just like with Renie."
01:23:02.727,01:23:04.896,"Amanda Leigh, take your sister into the house."
01:23:05.855,01:23:09.151,"Amanda, go on. Go on 'round the back, go."
01:23:12.237,01:23:15.532,-Vera? -You gotta take me to town now.
01:23:18.743,01:23:23.707,-I can't drive. -I seen you drivin'-- And I got in trouble for it. My husband took the keys away.
01:23:27.210,01:23:28.420,Come on.
01:23:56.448,01:24:00.076,Florence said she'd seen her walking down Main Street covered in blood.
01:24:02.245,01:24:04.914,She said it looked like she'd bathed in it.
01:24:07.459,01:24:09.961,Vera had stabbed him 17 times.
01:24:11.254,01:24:14.006,But I didn't find out those details till later.
01:24:16.218,01:24:18.470,I was too lost in my own misery.
01:24:31.023,01:24:32.775,"What's wrong, Mama?"
01:24:32.859,01:24:35.612,"Amanda Leigh, I need you to be a big girl and go and get Florence."
01:24:36.154,01:24:39.324,"You remember how to get there? Good girl, run as fast as you can."
01:24:46.664,01:24:48.125,No!
01:25:36.631,01:25:38.258,His name was Samuel.
01:26:13.084,01:26:15.211,I used to come here all the time when I was a boy.
01:26:16.838,01:26:20.675,Just when I needed to be alone and clear my mind.
01:26:21.467,01:26:23.344,"Well, I like what you've done with the place."
01:26:30.643,01:26:31.853,Here.
01:26:35.982,01:26:37.692,Why are you being so nice to me?
01:26:38.318,01:26:40.653,You look like you could use it.
01:26:52.957,01:26:54.376,Bullshit.
01:27:09.849,01:27:12.977,We made contact with a whole swarm of Messerschmitts.
01:27:19.234,01:27:21.944,"Took out my tail gun, co-pilot..."
01:27:23.988,01:27:26.449,Made a deal with God right there.
01:27:26.533,01:27:29.286,"Swore if he saved me, I was gonna do somethin' good."
01:27:32.789,01:27:35.041,"I don't know what that was, but..."
01:27:36.501,01:27:38.336,I promised anyway.
01:27:42.799,01:27:46.511,"Before you know, whole bunch of P-51s show up..."
01:27:47.470,01:27:49.472,just like goddamn cavalry.
01:27:50.640,01:27:53.476,They cleared those Germans right out of the sky.
01:27:56.020,01:27:59.148,"And I swear, they were angels sent by the Lord himself."
01:28:01.901,01:28:06.197,"Those P-51s, their tails was painted red."
01:28:07.365,01:28:09.659,One of 'em buzzed me right after the flight.
01:28:10.576,01:28:12.954,I looked over. I thought I was seeing things.
01:28:14.038,01:28:15.707,That fighter pilot...
01:28:18.251,01:28:19.502,he was colored.
01:28:23.965,01:28:25.550,He saluted me...
01:28:28.595,01:28:30.262,I saluted him back.
01:28:35.267,01:28:39.606,"Men that died that day... they were husbands, fathers."
01:28:40.732,01:28:42.066,They were good men.
01:28:44.027,01:28:45.445,A lot better than me.
01:29:12.389,01:29:13.765,"Oh, well."
01:29:56.265,01:29:58.976,"We brought this for you, Mama."
01:30:07.527,01:30:11.864,You can't have a shower without the screen up.
01:30:12.532,01:30:14.992,"Now, where do we put that?"
01:30:15.577,01:30:18.455,"What are you thinkin'? Maybe here, in the water?"
01:30:19.121,01:30:23.417,Now you gotta help me figure out where to put this.
01:30:23.501,01:30:26.671,What do you think? In there? You can smell it.
01:30:31.801,01:30:34.053,You were supposed to tell me if she was gonna be comin'.
01:30:41.728,01:30:44.313,"every now and then, if you were havin' a bath."
01:30:51.362,01:30:52.947,I think it's marvelous.
01:30:54.281,01:30:55.241,Thank you.
01:31:00.747,01:31:02.081,I'll fetch some water.
01:31:05.376,01:31:06.794,"They smell good, baby."
01:31:58.930,01:32:02.559,Can't sit still... can't move.
01:32:03.893,01:32:05.728,It's like he's just stewing.
01:32:06.813,01:32:08.230,Waiting for somethin'.
01:32:09.231,01:32:11.901,Waiting for whatever didn't happen to happen.
01:32:18.741,01:32:19.742,Whoo-hoo!
01:32:20.952,01:32:22.494,Already losing daylight!
01:33:04.829,01:33:07.915,-We gotta let him go. -We ain't holdin' him.
01:33:07.999,01:33:10.459,He's staying for us. I know he is.
01:33:11.085,01:33:12.544,"Well, what if he wants to stay?"
01:33:15.006,01:33:17.133,It's not always gonna be like this.
01:33:20.427,01:33:21.971,Soon as I'm healed...
01:33:23.640,01:33:25.057,we'll move out of here.
01:33:26.225,01:33:27.393,We'll be okay.
01:33:28.728,01:33:31.814,He'll be okay once he has his own place.
01:33:31.897,01:33:33.107,We'll be okay?
01:33:54.336,01:33:55.672,Remember that?
01:33:59.884,01:34:04.013,"You know what? You ain't supposed to be up on that broke leg all the time, Jackson."
01:34:05.306,01:34:07.683,"If you don't let it heal, you ain't never gonna walk."
01:34:08.559,01:34:10.645,Why walk if I can't dance?
01:34:39.340,01:34:42.176,Don't be impressed. I got it for being stupid.
01:34:46.097,01:34:48.349,You ever miss it sometimes? Being over there.
01:34:50.226,01:34:53.896,"I don't mean being shot at, but sometimes, I actually miss it."
01:34:58.609,01:34:59.777,"Yeah, me, too."
01:35:03.322,01:35:05.241,"Over there, I was a liberator."
01:35:07.785,01:35:10.454,People lined up in the streets waiting for us.
01:35:11.831,01:35:13.750,Throwing flowers and cheering.
01:35:17.128,01:35:19.714,"And here, I'm just another nigger pushing a plow."
01:35:23.134,01:35:24.718,"Some of the men, too."
01:35:27.471,01:35:30.683,"-Yeah, I think about 'em every day. -Seeing different parts of the world."
01:35:31.558,01:35:34.395,"Italian girls, English girls..."
01:35:37.314,01:35:41.485,Some of those hairy Greek girls with those big old hairy muffs...
01:35:41.568,01:35:46.073,"Yeah, it was somethin' else. It was somethin', man."
01:35:50.369,01:35:52.329,You ever been with a white girl?
01:36:05.259,01:36:09.013,"Shit, well... I'll be damned. Huh?"
01:36:14.601,01:36:23.152,"Army gave us separate barracks, separate blood supply, separate latrines."
01:36:28.782,01:36:31.828,But them European girls didn't have a problem with us at all.
01:36:34.246,01:36:39.043,"One day, we were up in Wimborne, old English girl walked past and slapped me right on my butt."
01:36:39.126,01:36:40.544,Never laid eyes on her.
01:36:41.253,01:36:46.550,Said the white GI's told her that we was more monkey than human.
01:36:49.303,01:36:50.762,And she was checking for a tail.
01:36:52.348,01:36:54.558,I'm sorry to laugh.
01:36:55.434,01:36:59.646,"So every opportunity we got, we showed 'em just how human we were."
01:37:02.900,01:37:04.861,"-Yep. -German girls, too, huh?"
01:37:07.238,01:37:08.239,Mm-hmm.
01:37:10.574,01:37:11.575,Uh-oh.
01:37:12.243,01:37:14.578,"Oh, oh, oh, oh."
01:37:14.661,01:37:16.497,I seen that look before.
01:37:18.582,01:37:20.542,She must have been somethin' special.
01:37:30.970,01:37:34.681,"But that was then, this is now, and I guess I'm right where I should be."
01:37:48.529,01:37:50.697,Throwing my life away.
01:38:24.231,01:38:27.151,"-I'll get you back safe, Rog. -I'll hold you to that."
01:39:00.101,01:39:01.685,"Oh, shit."
01:39:20.454,01:39:22.539,"We'll get it hauled out tomorrow, Henry."
01:39:59.743,01:40:01.829,It's half past nine. You just now gettin' up?
01:40:05.374,01:40:08.794,So I guess you gonna lay around all day while your brothers and sisters work?
01:40:09.753,01:40:10.754,Hmm?
01:40:10.837,01:40:12.464,"What's wrong with you, son?"
01:40:14.175,01:40:15.884,"What's wrong with you, boy?"
01:40:15.967,01:40:18.887,Letter came for you. Says it's all the way from Germany.
01:40:21.640,01:40:24.518,"Who's, uh, Resl? Ress..."
01:40:27.146,01:40:30.899,"How you... R-E-S-L. Ressil, Reecil... How you pronounce that?"
01:40:30.982,01:40:32.318,Somebody that I knew.
01:40:34.236,01:40:36.155,Where... Where you goin'?
01:41:00.971,01:41:03.807,"Oh, you think it's funny, do you? Spilling good milk."
01:41:04.266,01:41:07.561,"Well, you know what they say. No use crying over it."
01:41:08.104,01:41:11.273,"Yeah, at least, when it's somebody else's, that is."
01:41:11.357,01:41:15.986,"What do I... what do I owe you here, like, a buck fifty? Maybe two?"
01:41:16.069,01:41:17.946,Let's just make it even.
01:41:18.029,01:41:21.032,-I'm not talkin' about money! -What do you want from me?
01:41:21.117,01:41:22.784,What's the matter with you? Be a man!
01:41:22.868,01:41:24.953,"Oh, yeah? One pail of spilled milk and I ain't a man?"
01:41:25.037,01:41:27.247,You sure as hell ain't actin' like it!
01:41:27.748,01:41:32.378,"You come and go as you please, you disappear for days on end, and when you are here, you're drunk."
01:41:32.461,01:41:34.380,I don't answer to you.
01:41:34.463,01:41:37.048,"When you're under my roof and you work on my farm, you do."
01:41:37.133,01:41:38.759,"Oh, I'm sorry there, Mr. Boss Man."
01:41:38.842,01:41:42.304,Ain't my fault your damn farmin' dreams ain't working out.
01:41:43.054,01:41:45.932,Ain't my fault that your damn cotton fields are flooded out!
01:41:46.016,01:41:49.270,"You know your problem, Jamie? You don't know your own worth, brother."
01:41:49.353,01:41:51.939,You don't know what a man needs to know. A man ought to know.
01:41:53.815,01:41:56.443,"-You better open your eyes, big brother. -Open my eyes to what?"
01:41:56.527,01:41:59.571,You're so busy walkin' around here -like God Almighty... -Huh?
01:41:59.655,01:42:02.741,"...worryin' about yourself and your farm, you can't even see your own wife is miserable!"
01:42:10.249,01:42:11.917,-Or what? -Or what? Huh?
01:42:20.634,01:42:24.680,"-Yep. You know what, brother? -Yeah?"
01:42:24.763,01:42:27.641,"Fine, Jamie, go. Be whatever kind of man you want to be."
01:42:28.058,01:42:29.643,Just do it someplace else.
01:42:30.894,01:42:34.147,-That's fine. I'll go to town. -I'm not talkin' about town.
01:42:34.231,01:42:37.859,I'm going to Greenville tomorrow for a few days to see about livestock.
01:42:37.943,01:42:40.279,I'll expect you gone when I get back.
01:43:04.636,01:43:06.388,What's wrong with you?
01:43:19.359,01:43:22.196,You should have seen the look on your face.
01:43:22.905,01:43:23.947,It ain't funny.
01:43:24.615,01:43:27.075,"Au contraire, my friend. It is indeed."
01:43:27.576,01:43:29.202,You about crazy as hell.
01:43:29.745,01:43:31.997,"Well, I can't argue with that."
01:43:32.581,01:43:35.459,What you... What you doin' walking in the rain?
01:43:39.045,01:43:40.797,It don't matter.
01:43:45.886,01:43:46.929,What's the matter with you?
01:43:51.350,01:43:53.477,What's the worst thing you ever did?
01:43:54.270,01:43:56.272,Something bad.
01:43:56.355,01:43:58.565,Real bad and you knew it was gonna hurt someone...
01:44:01.068,01:44:02.486,but you did it anyway.
01:44:12.704,01:44:14.498,Leavin' this woman right here.
01:44:27.177,01:44:28.345,"Well, I'll be."
01:44:29.763,01:44:32.098,"Congratulations, you're a father."
01:44:35.226,01:44:36.770,His name's Franz.
01:44:38.063,01:44:39.773,"Franz, that's a good name."
01:44:41.316,01:44:42.651,What you gonna do now?
01:44:46.237,01:44:49.616,-She wants me to come back to Germany. -That's a long haul.
01:44:49.700,01:44:50.659,Yeah.
01:44:52.285,01:44:53.454,Long way.
01:44:56.039,01:44:58.500,"So, what about you? What's the worst thing you ever done?"
01:45:01.252,01:45:04.130,"Who, me? I'm a saint."
01:45:36.455,01:45:37.873,"Shit, put your head down."
01:45:44.588,01:45:46.339,You think they seen us?
01:45:46.423,01:45:47.966,I don't know.
01:46:03.023,01:46:04.358,"Well, here we are."
01:46:06.943,01:46:08.194,Yeah.
01:46:09.362,01:46:11.031,"Yeah, I'm leaving town soon."
01:46:12.366,01:46:13.533,I wanted to say good luck to you.
01:46:15.744,01:46:16.620,You've been a friend.
01:46:19.205,01:46:20.832,I want you to know that.
01:46:23.377,01:46:24.211,Yeah.
01:46:29.299,01:46:30.967,"You've been a friend, too."
01:46:33.554,01:46:35.597,You might be one of the good ones.
01:46:43.730,01:46:44.981,Take care.
01:47:00.122,01:47:02.249,I hope you find your way to your boy.
01:47:06.920,01:47:08.338,To your family.
01:47:17.806,01:47:19.558,"Take care of yourself, huh?"
01:47:21.852,01:47:22.853,"You, too."
01:47:34.406,01:47:35.323,"Hey, Mama."
01:47:35.824,01:47:38.076,"-You hungry? -No, I'm good."
01:47:38.660,01:47:40.078,Where is everybody?
01:47:40.161,01:47:42.498,Gone up to church. Late service.
01:47:48.044,01:47:49.129,Hmm.
01:48:05.812,01:48:08.023,"Hello there, dear family."
01:48:08.857,01:48:10.984,Who the hell was that with you in the truck?
01:48:11.067,01:48:13.862,The one I seen you drivin'. Who was it?
01:48:15.113,01:48:16.364,Ronsel Jackson. What's it to you?
01:48:16.448,01:48:22.037,You wanna tell me why that nigger was ridin' upside you in the truck like two peas in a pod?
01:48:23.288,01:48:25.916,He can ride wherever I say. Anything else?
01:48:25.999,01:48:29.878,You. You son of a bitch.
01:48:34.883,01:48:38.136,"-You ain't worth a damn, you know that? -Yeah, I know that."
01:48:38.219,01:48:41.056,"Mr. Big, Big War Hero, is ya?"
01:48:41.139,01:48:44.517,You're nothin' but a damn drunk! Give me them keys.
01:48:47.521,01:48:49.940,"Oh, you want him all to yourself, huh, gal?"
01:48:50.440,01:48:52.734,Too bad he's all liquored up. He can't do you any good.
01:48:52.818,01:48:55.195,-I beg your pardon? -I seen you sniffin' after him.
01:48:55.278,01:49:00.450,"-Pappy. -Maybe Henry is too thick to notice, but I ain't."
01:49:44.327,01:49:47.413,"-You seen the letter, Mama? -The one from Germany?"
01:49:47.497,01:49:49.833,"Oh, God, okay. All right. Hold on."
01:49:49.916,01:49:52.669,"Don't fret. Just wait till your father come back, okay?"
01:49:52.753,01:49:55.296,Ronsel? Ronsel!
01:50:01.511,01:50:05.390,"-You'll be here for supper tonight? -Uh, no."
01:50:08.184,01:50:09.645,You goin' someplace?
01:50:10.561,01:50:13.106,"Yeah. Might, uh, head out west."
01:50:13.189,01:50:15.817,Got a war buddy who lives in Los Angeles.
01:50:15.901,01:50:19.570,"Los Angeles? Jamie, what are you talking about?"
01:50:20.196,01:50:23.033,-He didn't tell you? -Who didn't tell me what?
01:50:23.742,01:50:24.701,Henry.
01:50:25.744,01:50:27.162,Told me to leave.
01:50:29.039,01:50:31.750,"-Probably for the best. -So just like that, you up and leave?"
01:50:32.458,01:50:34.670,Were you even plannin' on sayin' goodbye?
01:50:36.587,01:50:40.550,'Course. First bus don't leave till 2:00.
01:50:40.634,01:50:43.386,What about the girls? This will break their hearts.
01:50:44.262,01:50:45.931,"Laura, I can't stay here."
01:50:46.932,01:50:47.766,I don't...
01:50:52.270,01:50:53.855,"You don't need to go, Jamie."
01:52:24.362,01:52:25.822,-Get him up. -Come on.
01:52:41.129,01:52:43.423,Put your shoes on. Come with us.
01:53:08.281,01:53:10.575,"Like hell, I will! You turn him loose, damn it!"
01:53:10.658,01:53:12.077,"-You best listen, son. -I ain't your son!"
01:53:13.119,01:53:17.123,"Now I suggest you use that thing, or you better point elsewhere."
01:53:17.207,01:53:18.791,"Otherwise, you better kill us both."
01:53:18.875,01:53:23.296,You betray your own blood for the sake of a nigger?
01:53:33.890,01:53:35.975,Did you rut with this woman?
01:53:36.059,01:53:39.062,What the hell do you fellas care about some Kraut whore anyway?
01:53:39.562,01:53:42.858,All those Fräulein cunts got a lot of our boys killed.
01:53:42.941,01:53:47.863,"I say if Ronsel here gave her a little half-breed bundle of joy to remind her of it, I call it justice!"
01:53:49.572,01:53:52.200,How the hell do you know that Ronsel here's the father anyway?
01:53:54.911,01:53:57.539,I ain't gonna say child... This abomination?
01:54:02.127,01:54:04.212,Go on! Say it!
01:54:21.354,01:54:22.688,Pappy?
01:54:24.149,01:54:25.150,Huh?
01:54:30.321,01:54:31.864,He ain't gonna shoot.
01:54:34.450,01:54:39.915,"You don't have the balls to kill a man up close, do you, son?"
01:54:44.752,01:54:47.088,You ain't gonna kill your own Pappy.
01:55:16.451,01:55:20.205,"You make one more wrong move, these boys are liable to kill you."
01:55:21.581,01:55:22.873,What we gonna do with him?
01:55:22.957,01:55:26.794,"I already told you, he won't talk. Ain't that right, son?"
01:55:27.628,01:55:29.297,You set him loose.
01:55:39.390,01:55:42.185,You let my son there decide how.
01:55:52.237,01:55:56.532,"You don't want him killed, then you decide the punishment."
01:55:56.908,01:55:58.117,No!
01:55:58.660,01:56:03.081,"His tongue, his eyes, or his balls?"
01:56:04.290,01:56:05.833,Choose.
01:56:12.465,01:56:14.550,"Choose, God damn it!"
01:57:13.234,01:57:15.528,"-Hold his legs out. -Hold them out, straight."
01:58:15.921,01:58:17.673,He was warm and alive.
01:58:20.843,01:58:22.928,I know every place in him.
01:59:34.917,01:59:36.169,Pappy?
01:59:46.179,01:59:47.930,They got Ronsel.
01:59:50.183,01:59:51.892,There were too many of them.
01:59:53.143,01:59:56.063,"What? Jamie, what happened to him?"
01:59:56.146,01:59:57.690,They were too many of 'em. I...
01:59:59.400,02:00:01.361,-Jamie... -I couldn't stop 'em.
02:00:02.486,02:00:04.822,What did they do to him? Is he alive?
02:00:05.448,02:00:08.243,-They made me choose. -Choose what?
02:00:20.338,02:00:23.173,I wanted to make sure I looked you in the eye.
02:01:06.467,02:01:08.761,"I'll see you in a couple of days, huh?"
02:01:21.274,02:01:25.027,It's your father. He died last night.
02:01:30.074,02:01:33.994,"-How? -In his sleep, peacefully."
02:02:02.147,02:02:03.649,"-Hap! -Henry, don't."
02:02:03.733,02:02:05.818,It ain't my fault what happened.
02:02:09.947,02:02:11.407,"Hap, can you hold on?"
02:02:18.539,02:02:20.875,Need to get the coffin in the ground.
02:02:28.508,02:02:29.550,Hap?
02:02:41.061,02:02:42.062,Hap?
02:02:49.153,02:02:50.071,Appreciate it.
02:02:55.868,02:02:56.952,Why don't you use your boys?
02:02:57.453,02:02:59.830,My sons are not gettin' down out of that wagon.
02:03:02.041,02:03:03.208,Okay.
02:03:07.296,02:03:08.213,There we go.
02:03:12.760,02:03:15.430,He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down.
02:03:15.513,02:03:18.557,He fleeth as a shadow and continueth not.
02:03:19.099,02:03:24.313,"And doth thou open thine eyes upon such a one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?"
02:03:25.064,02:03:29.276,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.
02:03:29.944,02:03:33.948,"For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again."
02:03:34.865,02:03:37.159,But man dieth and wasteth away.
02:03:37.743,02:03:43.374,"As the waters fell from the sea and drieth up, so man lieth down and riseth not."
02:03:44.625,02:03:50.840,"'Til the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep."
02:03:54.719,02:03:55.761,Amen.
02:04:09.609,02:04:12.653,"Come on, brother. Amen, Pappy."
02:04:31.296,02:04:32.840,Give this to Ronsel...
02:04:37.553,02:04:39.221,if you see him.
02:05:09.001,02:05:10.252,Jamie!
02:05:16.509,02:05:17.885,Jamie!
02:05:31.148,02:05:33.442,"First, I'm in a tank wearing a helmet."
02:05:34.860,02:05:38.072,Then I'm in the back of a car with a burlap sack over my head.
02:05:40.032,02:05:44.411,"I scream. My lips move, and I can feel the strain."
02:05:45.370,02:05:47.206,But there's nothing coming out.
02:05:53.128,02:05:56.006,brought the Jackson family some measure of peace.
02:05:57.049,02:05:59.509,Though I must admit it brings me none.
02:06:02.262,02:06:17.236,"All the while hoping that, by some miracle, Silenced and defeated?"
02:06:18.737,02:06:22.783,"Oppression, fear, deformity."
02:06:24.785,02:06:27.788,It would take an extraordinary man to beat all that.
02:06:29.665,02:06:32.459,I would have to wean myself off laudanum and self-pity...
02:06:33.419,02:06:37.006,and travel with a little card in my shirt pocket that said mute.
02:06:41.885,02:06:43.178,"And then, finally..."
02:06:44.471,02:06:47.266,I would have to cross the Atlantic yet again.
02:06:50.352,02:06:51.895,This time not for war.
02:06:55.816,02:06:57.234,But for love.
02:06:58.485,02:07:00.112,Ronsel.
02:07:39.151,02:07:40.235,With love.
00:57:06.297,00:57:07.882,"This is over, yes?"
