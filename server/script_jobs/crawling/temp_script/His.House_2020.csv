00:35:43.958,00:35:44.958,She lives.
00:41:08.458,00:41:11.208,Don't leave me with nothing.
01:06:51.791,01:06:53.666,I know what you are.
01:07:06.000,01:07:07.958,This is just a dream.
01:07:11.791,01:07:13.041,Where is she?
01:07:15.000,01:07:15.958,Who?
01:07:17.291,01:07:18.375,My daughter.
01:07:22.041,01:07:23.125,Who?
01:12:47.500,01:12:49.000,I'll protect you.
00:02:00.541,00:02:01.375,Nyagak!
00:02:15.583,00:02:16.916,What did you dream about?
00:02:19.791,00:02:21.000,Our wedding day.
00:02:25.500,00:02:27.166,Explains the screams.
00:02:50.375,00:02:51.666,You're wanted in the gym.
00:02:54.416,00:02:55.375,Why?
00:03:12.083,00:03:17.458,"They will send you back to die, like the bastards always do."
00:04:00.583,00:04:04.458,You're being released from detention. Today if you're lucky.
00:04:18.833,00:04:21.833,"This is bail, Mr. and Mrs. Majur."
00:04:21.916,00:04:24.458,You're being released on bail as asylum seekers.
00:04:24.541,00:04:26.541,"Not as citizens, not yet."
00:04:26.625,00:04:27.791,You both understand?
00:04:29.458,00:04:32.333,"Until then, you'll be subject to certain conditions."
00:04:32.416,00:04:36.833,"If you fail to meet these, even just the once, you'll be returned to detention."
00:04:36.916,00:04:40.291,Your case may be disqualified and you'll be sent back.
00:04:40.375,00:04:41.708,Do you understand?
00:04:43.500,00:04:45.583,"Okie-dokie. All right, conditions."
00:04:45.666,00:04:48.291,You will be reviewed and must report to us weekly.
00:04:48.375,00:04:50.458,You must not miss a single report.
00:04:50.541,00:04:52.208,"A yes, if you understand, please."
00:04:53.125,00:04:54.791,-Yes. -Yes. Yes.
00:04:54.875,00:04:58.625,You will be given financial weekly support of 74 pounds in total.
00:04:58.708,00:05:03.166,You do not have permission to work or to supplement your earnings by any other means.
00:05:03.250,00:05:04.916,"A yes, if you understand, please."
00:05:05.500,00:05:06.500,-Yes. -Yes.
00:05:06.583,00:05:10.833,Final condition. You will be sent to a home of our choosing.
00:05:10.916,00:05:13.041,You must reside at this address.
00:05:13.125,00:05:15.583,You must not move from this address.
00:05:15.666,00:05:17.291,This is your home now.
00:05:17.958,00:05:19.375,"A yes, if you understand."
00:05:20.375,00:05:21.416,We are good people.
00:05:21.500,00:05:23.958,"A yes, if you understand."
00:05:25.208,00:05:26.541,-Yes. -Yes.
00:05:26.625,00:05:30.875,"Whether or not you're good people, it's not me that needs convincing."
00:05:49.166,00:05:50.583,Where are we going?
00:07:14.250,00:07:15.375,Do you speak English?
00:07:24.000,00:07:25.000,This is for you.
00:07:25.708,00:07:26.791,"Here we are, then."
00:07:28.125,00:07:29.833,"Home sweet home. Amazing, innit?"
00:07:30.458,00:07:31.375,It's a palace.
00:07:32.041,00:07:35.250,"Normally, it should be half the size with twice as many of you in it, but..."
00:07:38.125,00:07:39.791,This is... this is all for you.
00:07:42.083,00:07:42.958,Why are we so special?
00:07:44.583,00:07:46.041,You must've won the jackpot.
00:07:48.791,00:07:49.833,Shit.
00:07:49.916,00:07:51.291,"All right, a few ground rules."
00:07:51.375,00:07:54.791,"Uh... no candles, no smoking, no animals."
00:07:59.083,00:08:02.750,"We'll fix that. No pets, no guests, no friends, no parties."
00:08:03.375,00:08:06.166,"No ball games, no games, no balls."
00:08:07.541,00:08:08.500,Uh...
00:08:08.958,00:08:11.750,Get some screws for your door. There's a shop round the corner.
00:08:11.833,00:08:14.333,"Uh, say hello to your neighbors and that, and..."
00:08:15.416,00:08:16.958,"Yeah, you'll be all right."
00:08:18.791,00:08:21.000,"Didn't have time to get the cleaners, but..."
00:08:21.666,00:08:22.916,give it a wipe down.
00:08:26.291,00:08:27.666,There's a doctor down the road.
00:08:28.666,00:08:29.958,I'll draw you a map.
00:08:33.250,00:08:34.541,I wouldn't worry about the smell.
00:08:35.291,00:08:37.583,"Open a window, the place should air out."
00:08:38.208,00:08:39.458,Main thing is it's yours.
00:08:40.250,00:08:42.541,"A new beginning starts with a single step, innit?"
00:08:51.958,00:08:53.250,Confident signature.
00:08:55.250,00:08:56.333,I work in a bank.
00:08:59.250,00:09:00.500,I worked in a bank.
00:09:06.791,00:09:09.125,-Eh? -This entire house is just for us?
00:09:10.208,00:09:11.208,Yeah.
00:09:12.958,00:09:14.000,All of it.
00:09:15.500,00:09:16.375,Home.
00:09:16.791,00:09:17.875,Bigger than my house.
00:09:18.958,00:09:20.666,I think you two are gonna be all right.
00:09:21.250,00:09:23.166,"As long as you can get along, fit in."
00:09:24.208,00:09:26.375,-We are not going back. -That's the spirit.
00:09:27.041,00:09:28.958,Make it easy for people.
00:09:30.250,00:09:31.666,Be one of the good ones.
00:11:29.750,00:11:31.250,We will be new here.
00:11:34.125,00:11:35.500,We're born again.
00:11:39.416,00:11:40.416,Born again.
00:12:32.916,00:12:34.208,Hm.
00:13:09.916,00:13:12.333,Shh. Shh...
00:14:01.041,00:14:02.000,Hello?
00:15:04.208,00:15:05.458,Strange country.
00:16:06.250,00:16:07.583,It's their queen.
00:16:16.000,00:16:17.250,Where is Charles?
00:16:22.708,00:17:35.500,Aah-- Where are we?
00:17:36.000,00:17:37.291,"High Street, mate."
00:17:40.333,00:17:41.541,In London?
00:18:03.291,00:18:05.166,You one of them refugees?
00:18:06.875,00:18:08.666,Got something for ya.
00:18:15.458,00:18:17.458,Crouch began perfectly...
00:18:24.750,00:18:26.041,Hey!
00:18:45.500,00:18:48.250,You were singing songs about this Peter Crouch?
00:18:50.500,00:18:51.791,Adult men.
00:18:53.375,00:18:54.666,It's just a funny song.
00:18:55.208,00:18:57.875,I think it is the worst song I've ever heard.
00:19:05.375,00:19:06.958,Maybe I'll go out tomorrow.
00:19:07.916,00:19:08.833,Wonderful.
00:23:15.833,00:23:16.875,Bol?
00:23:19.708,00:23:20.750,Bol?
00:24:33.458,00:24:35.458,Church Street.
00:24:43.000,00:24:45.291,Hello? Oi. Hello?
00:26:12.541,00:26:13.416,Want some chips?
00:26:23.041,00:26:25.708,"-I don't want you to have one, anyway. -Them chips are wet, bruv."
00:26:25.791,00:26:27.125,"Um, these chips are nice."
00:26:27.208,00:26:29.166,-What the fuck are you doing? -What's all this?
00:26:36.375,00:26:38.583,"-Chat to her, bro. -Aw, you need to chat to her, bruv."
00:26:40.583,00:26:41.833,-You all right? -Can you...
00:26:44.083,00:26:45.333,-Pardon? -Sorry?
00:26:47.916,00:26:52.708,"-Church? -Church-- Church Street, darlin', yeah?"
00:26:52.791,00:26:56.333,"But anyways, it's that side, I think, on the left."
00:26:56.416,00:26:58.458,"-Bruv, what are you talkin' about? -What do you mean?"
00:26:58.541,00:27:00.791,"Take this left here, walk all the way down to the end."
00:27:00.875,00:27:02.958,"-It's just on the right hand side, yeah? -Are you nuts?"
00:27:03.041,00:27:06.791,"-Nah, it's like, down there, by the bank. -Yeah."
00:27:07.583,00:27:09.666,-You're chattin' shit. -You know the bank?
00:27:10.500,00:27:12.875,"-Oh! No, no, no, he's right still. -Is he?"
00:27:12.958,00:27:15.958,"No, he's right still. Yeah, sorry, my bad. No, it is. Head back that way."
00:27:16.041,00:27:17.541,"-It's just by the bank, yeah. -You sure?"
00:27:17.625,00:27:18.791,"-For real, 100 percent. -Yeah."
00:27:24.625,00:27:26.208,Is it-- Stop foolin' about.
00:27:30.083,00:27:33.333,"Go back to Africa. Only English around here, darlin'."
00:27:48.333,00:27:49.458,I love your necklace.
00:27:51.416,00:27:53.083,It was Nyagak's.
00:27:53.166,00:27:56.083,"Oh, is that your daughter? Mine's a real handful."
00:27:57.083,00:28:00.125,"You registered her yet? We should take a look at her, too."
00:28:14.500,00:28:15.625,Those are pretty.
00:28:17.166,00:28:19.625,These I've had since I was a little girl.
00:28:22.000,00:28:23.166,Mm.
00:28:25.666,00:28:28.583,These I gave to myself with a knife.
00:28:31.041,00:28:33.166,When I found my family butchered.
00:28:37.041,00:28:39.375,There are two tribes where I'm from.
00:28:42.208,00:28:44.291,They're both killing each other.
00:28:48.583,00:28:51.916,"Depending on which one you belong to, you mark yourself."
00:28:53.375,00:28:54.583,I marked myself with both.
00:28:56.958,00:28:59.416,I survived by belonging nowhere.
00:29:08.666,00:29:10.000,We lost her.
00:29:12.125,00:29:13.958,When we crossed the sea.
00:29:30.750,00:29:32.666,I think there's someone living there.
00:30:00.000,00:30:01.000,Mm.
00:30:31.583,00:30:32.541,Come.
00:31:13.791,00:31:15.041,You went outside?
00:31:29.708,00:31:31.958,"But maybe next time, we can use the table."
00:32:13.083,00:32:14.916,All I can taste is the metal.
00:32:15.000,00:32:16.625,You will get used to it.
00:32:20.166,00:32:22.166,"Hm! Mm, mm!"
00:32:23.333,00:32:25.000,"Mm, mm, mm."
00:32:27.750,00:32:29.208,We will thrive.
00:32:29.916,00:32:31.625,I have seen jobs here.
00:32:33.625,00:32:35.416,They give you a chance here.
00:32:38.000,00:32:39.625,We can start a family.
00:32:47.375,00:32:48.583,I am restless.
00:33:00.333,00:33:02.791,My mother used to tell me a story.
00:33:05.875,00:33:13.958,"In our village, there was once an honorable but poor man who wanted a home of his own."
00:33:16.125,00:33:19.958,"He wanted it so badly, he began to steal from others."
00:33:22.750,00:33:24.083,One day...
00:33:24.666,00:33:28.041,he stole from an old man who lived by the river.
00:33:31.083,00:33:35.375,He didn't know that this man was an apeth.
00:33:38.333,00:33:39.791,A night witch.
00:33:42.583,00:33:45.958,And so the thief could not know that when he built his home...
00:33:47.708,00:33:50.583,"the apeth, too, would live there."
00:33:53.916,00:34:01.041,"So, before long, the walls would whisper the spells of the apeth."
00:34:04.375,00:34:06.208,From the shadows...
00:34:08.208,00:34:10.000,the dead would come.
00:34:10.875,00:34:13.250,The apeth would not stop...
00:34:14.625,00:34:18.250,until he had consumed the man entirely.
00:34:24.541,00:34:27.458,An apeth has arisen from the ocean.
00:34:30.541,00:34:32.750,It has followed us here.
00:34:39.416,00:34:41.041,It spoke to me.
00:34:52.333,00:34:54.500,We don't belong here.
00:34:56.625,00:34:58.291,If we leave...
00:34:58.833,00:35:00.875,and repay our debt...
00:35:02.916,00:35:05.208,...it would guide us back to her.
00:35:07.916,00:35:09.416,To Nyagak.
00:35:32.333,00:35:33.541,She's gone.
00:35:34.375,00:35:36.000,"My love, she's gone."
00:35:36.541,00:35:38.375,-The sea took her. -You're not listening.
00:35:40.583,00:35:41.416,English!
00:35:41.500,00:35:43.791,-I will speak my mother's language. -Listen to what you are saying.
00:35:55.041,00:35:56.791,There is no witch.
00:36:10.750,00:36:13.416,I had assured myself it was a dream.
00:36:18.458,00:36:19.791,Perhaps I am...
00:36:22.625,00:36:24.916,imagining things that aren't there.
00:36:28.750,00:36:31.291,But now I have looked into your eyes.
00:36:34.083,00:36:35.291,You're a liar.
00:37:17.916,00:37:18.916,Rial?
00:38:29.250,00:38:30.083,Mama.
00:38:32.458,00:38:33.541,Mama.
00:38:35.166,00:38:36.000,Mama.
00:38:37.875,00:38:39.000,Mama.
00:38:40.875,00:38:42.875,-Mama. -Nya?
00:38:46.833,00:38:48.166,Mama.
00:39:24.125,00:39:25.083,Huh.
00:39:47.291,00:39:48.583,You saw it.
00:40:15.791,00:40:16.750,Bol.
00:40:19.750,00:40:20.833,What are you doing?
00:40:21.458,00:40:23.291,We have to destroy everything.
00:40:23.375,00:40:24.583,It's cursed.
00:40:24.666,00:40:26.916,"-Everything we brought is cursed. -Bol, what are you doing?"
00:40:27.291,00:40:29.166,What are you doing? Leave it! Stop!
00:40:29.250,00:40:30.541,"No, that's my father's."
00:40:32.625,00:40:34.833,What do you mean marked? What did you see?
00:40:40.208,00:40:41.291,Bol?
00:40:52.583,00:43:33.333,-Oh... Why? Don't! -Let-- Perhaps if you spoke to him...
00:44:00.333,00:44:02.375,Perhaps you think we're going mad.
00:44:02.791,00:44:06.583,I think it's not healthy for you to be alone all the time.
00:44:07.375,00:44:08.791,Dwelling with your thoughts.
00:44:10.583,00:44:12.458,"Tomorrow, we will find you something to do."
00:44:12.958,00:44:14.333,Something in the community.
00:44:15.041,00:44:17.041,"Make friends, be good."
00:44:17.666,00:44:19.583,-We are not like them. -We can be.
00:44:23.166,00:44:25.375,You don't wonder what it tells me?
00:44:29.083,00:44:30.250,You are right.
00:44:31.291,00:44:32.333,Maybe you are mad.
00:44:32.791,00:44:35.125,Frightening yourself with imaginary things in the dark.
00:44:35.208,00:44:39.000,"After all we've endured, after what we have seen..."
00:44:39.833,00:44:43.333,"what men can do, you think it is bumps in the night that frighten me?"
00:44:45.791,00:44:48.208,You think I can be afraid of ghosts?
00:44:52.250,00:44:54.291,It says I can get her back.
00:44:58.208,00:45:00.500,And it says I should be afraid of you.
00:45:08.458,00:45:09.875,This is our home.
00:48:07.250,00:48:09.250,I can't breathe. Help me.
00:48:24.708,00:48:25.750,Mama?
00:48:28.750,00:48:29.833,Mama?
00:48:54.791,00:48:55.833,Nyagak?
00:50:03.375,00:50:04.458,Get out!
00:50:05.250,00:50:07.666,Get out! Get out!
00:50:08.083,00:50:10.708,Get out! Get out!
00:50:43.166,00:50:45.541,"Adam, uh... do you wanna get him some juice?"
00:50:46.791,00:50:48.750,"So, Bol, what's goin' on?"
00:50:50.875,00:50:51.833,The house.
00:50:55.500,00:50:56.958,You havin' problems with the property?
00:51:02.250,00:51:03.666,You wanna live somewhere else?
00:51:05.750,00:51:07.250,Oh. Okay.
00:51:09.666,00:51:12.333,"Sure, yeah, we can look into that for you."
00:51:13.166,00:51:14.833,"But first, you have to tell me why."
00:51:15.750,00:51:18.041,"I mean, can you name me one of the problems?"
00:51:23.416,00:51:25.000,There are... vermin.
00:51:25.958,00:51:28.166,Rats and bugs.
00:51:28.750,00:51:30.208,They are making us sick.
00:51:31.500,00:51:32.625,Rial is very ill.
00:51:33.375,00:51:34.333,Has she seen a doctor?
00:51:34.416,00:51:35.291,-Yes. -Good.
00:51:35.375,00:51:36.875,He says...
00:51:37.958,00:51:39.458,Get out of the house.
00:51:39.541,00:51:40.958,We have to move.
00:51:41.750,00:51:43.041,Where?
00:51:52.041,00:51:53.208,Uh...
00:51:54.791,00:51:56.166,"Look, mate, this is..."
00:51:57.083,00:51:59.875,this is gonna raise a lot of questions... Bol.
00:52:05.125,00:52:07.125,They're gonna ask you why you're not adapting.
00:52:08.333,00:52:09.625,We are adapting.
00:52:23.541,00:52:27.791,"I used to work in a bank, too, believe it not, back in the day, before they moved all the jobs..."
00:52:28.500,00:52:29.708,abroad.
00:52:36.916,00:52:38.541,But I think...
00:52:38.625,00:52:42.125,I think that's life trying to show you what kind of man you are.
00:52:43.833,00:52:45.041,Do you know what I'm sayin'?
00:52:45.625,00:52:47.791,"I'm tryin' to work out what kind of man you are, Bol."
00:52:49.041,00:52:50.291,I just need a new house.
00:52:51.958,00:52:53.375,Right after the inquiry.
00:52:54.500,00:52:58.333,"Look at the state of you. You're a mess. You don't look well, mate, you look ill."
00:52:58.416,00:53:00.541,You don't smell good. You smell bad.
00:53:01.208,00:53:04.791,You're not making any sense. It would have to be reported. And then...
00:53:06.416,00:53:10.750,"people, not me, but people are then gonna ask, Why is he bitin' the hand that's feedin' him?"
00:53:11.625,00:53:13.916,-We can live anywhere else. -There's rats everywhere.
00:53:14.000,00:53:16.166,"-Anywhere else. -Oh, right. So it's not about the rats."
00:53:21.375,00:53:22.625,-in... -What is that?
00:53:29.000,00:53:30.833,"Can't be that bad, you're laughin'."
00:53:32.541,00:53:34.833,"If you want me to make a fuss, mate, I will make a fuss."
00:53:34.916,00:53:37.166,"-Yes! -If you want me to do it, then I will."
00:54:06.250,00:54:07.208,Hang on.
00:54:51.250,00:54:52.333,What?
00:54:53.666,00:54:54.833,Why don't you just leave?
00:54:55.625,00:54:57.083,We live here now.
00:54:57.458,00:54:59.458,They're gonna kick you out anyway.
00:55:00.541,00:55:01.791,I'm tryin' to help you.
00:55:03.666,00:55:05.375,I'll give it a week.
00:55:23.208,00:55:24.666,Must be big rats.
00:55:29.500,00:55:31.250,Telling me that rats...
00:55:33.083,00:55:34.250,did this?
00:55:37.166,00:55:38.208,"Come on, man."
00:55:41.125,00:55:44.125,"Well, I'm... I'm gonna have to report it now."
00:55:44.208,00:55:45.791,Please. Please...
00:55:45.875,00:55:48.000,"No, I'm gonna have to. I'm gonna have to take photos."
00:55:49.916,00:55:51.000,No. No!
00:55:52.583,00:55:54.000,Let me fix it.
00:55:58.041,00:55:59.541,We are not going back.
00:56:01.208,00:56:02.208,Please.
00:56:02.750,00:56:05.583,We are one of the good ones. Remember?
00:56:07.625,00:56:09.416,We are not going back.
00:56:16.000,00:56:17.375,"Yep. All right then, mist..."
00:56:17.458,00:56:20.000,"Mr. Majur, we will let you off with a warning this time."
00:56:20.083,00:56:22.083,-Hang-- hang on a minute. -Let me deal with it.
00:56:29.458,00:56:31.083,You haven't told them?
00:56:35.416,00:56:38.166,There's a great beast in this house.
00:56:38.958,00:56:40.791,It followed us here.
00:56:41.500,00:56:44.625,My husband's been chasing it all night with a hammer.
00:56:46.916,00:56:49.041,It knows great magic.
00:56:49.625,00:56:52.625,It's filling this house with ghosts.
00:56:53.333,00:56:57.166,It torments my husband with visits from her.
00:56:58.541,00:56:59.916,Nyagak.
00:57:02.291,00:57:05.666,But my husband is a very stubborn man.
00:57:08.875,00:57:10.916,He still believes he can deny it.
00:57:11.750,00:57:13.875,You should put that into your report.
00:57:24.416,00:57:25.666,They can kiss England goodbye.
00:57:39.333,00:57:43.708,They don't want to be reminded that it is them that are weak.
00:57:44.666,00:57:46.375,How poor...
00:57:47.000,00:57:48.291,and lazy...
00:57:49.041,00:57:51.333,and bored they are.
00:57:51.416,00:57:52.458,Rial.
00:57:54.958,00:57:56.541,"Now, sorry."
00:57:58.583,00:58:00.875,"-Sorry, sorry, sorry... -Rial."
00:58:04.500,00:58:05.833,And you...
00:58:08.208,00:58:09.750,You still idolize them.
00:58:16.541,00:58:20.625,And then you thank them for the unseasoned scraps they throw us.
00:58:23.125,00:58:24.708,You eat them up.
00:58:32.666,00:58:34.291,Let them send us back.
00:58:34.958,00:58:36.666,But this is our home.
00:58:39.125,00:58:40.708,We're going back.
00:58:42.458,00:58:45.375,I'm leaving. With or without you.
00:58:46.541,00:58:51.250,How quickly you forget everything we went through to get here.
00:58:52.625,00:59:21.791,How quickly you forget our daugh-- You are sick.
00:59:29.083,00:59:31.041,This is our home.
00:59:36.375,00:59:38.208,You are not going anywhere.
01:00:17.416,01:00:20.666,"This time, you talk to me."
01:01:41.750,01:01:42.916,Where are you?
01:02:03.958,01:02:05.750,Repay what you owe.
01:02:12.375,01:02:15.000,And I am the butcher.
01:02:15.875,01:02:19.916,"No matter where you go, I follow."
01:02:22.083,01:02:25.833,You are mine now.
01:02:27.958,01:02:29.208,What do you want?
01:02:30.833,01:02:33.625,Your life for Nyagak.
01:02:33.708,01:02:34.750,What?
01:02:37.708,01:02:41.666,Take this knife and open your flesh.
01:02:49.333,01:02:51.125,Why don't you come for me yourself?
01:03:15.041,01:03:16.458,You can't touch me.
01:03:21.250,01:03:22.958,You can't touch me.
01:03:23.041,01:03:25.000,You can't touch me. You can't hurt me.
01:03:28.041,01:03:32.083,Make yourself at home. Pictures can't hurt me.
01:03:46.208,01:03:47.166,No.
01:03:47.875,01:03:49.291,"No, no, stop!"
01:03:51.750,01:03:53.083,"No, stop."
01:03:53.166,01:03:55.833,Stop! Stop! Stop!
01:03:56.666,01:03:58.291,Stop! Stop!
01:04:02.833,01:04:05.041,Pictures can't hurt me. Pictures can't hurt me.
01:04:43.833,01:04:44.833,Rial!
01:04:45.541,01:04:47.583,"No. No, no."
01:04:47.666,01:04:48.500,-Get off. -Come.
01:04:48.583,01:04:49.791,-Get off me. -Come back.
01:04:49.875,01:04:51.666,-Don't touch me! Stop! -Get back!
01:04:59.458,01:05:00.291,Hey!
01:05:15.500,01:05:16.625,Rial!
01:05:50.541,01:05:51.958,Oh!
01:07:06.041,01:07:07.541,This is just a dream.
01:07:14.875,01:07:16.208,Who?
01:07:17.166,01:07:18.500,My daughter.
01:07:21.875,01:07:22.958,Who?
01:07:44.083,01:07:45.291,Rial?
01:07:52.458,01:07:53.583,Rial!
01:08:25.375,01:08:28.416,Rial. Hey. Come.

01:08:33.791,01:08:36.250,I'm here. I'm here.
01:08:39.333,01:08:40.375,Rial?
01:08:43.125,01:08:44.125,Rial.
01:08:44.958,01:08:45.958,Rial.
01:08:46.916,01:08:49.416,Look at me. Look. Look at me.
01:08:52.750,01:08:54.166,We have to leave now.
01:08:56.125,01:08:58.166,Now. We have to go. Come.
01:08:59.500,01:09:01.666,Rial. Rial!

01:10:30.500,01:10:32.833,"-Come, come forward. -We are going to make space."
01:10:34.375,01:10:36.041,-You have space for two more? -Too many. No.
01:10:36.125,01:10:38.625,Two more! Two more! Two more!
01:10:38.708,01:10:39.791,-Please! -Children only!
01:10:41.000,01:10:42.500,"Come, come, come. That's it."
01:10:42.583,01:10:44.625,-No. Get off. -You have space!
01:10:44.708,01:10:46.333,"-No, no, no! You wait! -No, sir. No, sir."
01:10:46.416,01:10:48.166,-Please! -Mama.
01:10:48.250,01:10:49.583,That's it. Too many now.

01:10:51.166,01:10:52.458,-Wait. Wait! -Mama.
01:10:58.375,01:10:59.291,"We have to go, sir."
01:10:59.375,01:11:03.291,-I said children. You are not a child. -Wait-- No! We have to go! We have to go!
01:11:03.750,01:11:07.416,-No! -She-- She's a child! She's a child!

01:13:24.583,01:13:25.458,Nyagak!

01:13:28.375,01:13:29.833,Bol! Nyagak!
01:13:30.375,01:13:31.875,Nyagak!
01:14:36.083,01:14:38.458,Sever his flesh.
01:14:40.333,01:14:42.708,Give me his body...
01:14:43.458,01:14:46.916,and I will give you what you want.
01:17:40.125,01:17:41.916,This is what it wants.
01:18:11.166,01:18:13.041,I should have saved her.
01:18:19.166,01:18:20.791,"I see them, too."
01:18:25.916,01:18:27.208,I see her.
01:18:29.916,01:18:31.250,All of them.
01:18:33.708,01:18:36.333,"From the boat, from home."
01:18:42.875,01:18:44.625,And what does that make us?
01:18:51.916,01:18:53.125,He's coming.
01:19:05.250,01:19:06.250,Go!
01:20:11.583,01:20:15.041,You are mine.
01:20:42.916,01:20:44.666,Aaaaah!
01:21:57.583,01:21:59.000,I'm going home.
01:22:52.375,01:22:54.541,"Hello, Rial. Sorry to bother you."
01:22:55.000,01:22:57.958,"Uh, we work with Mark. May we come in?"
01:23:00.541,01:23:01.625,Come in.
01:23:33.333,01:23:34.458,You seem well.
01:23:40.916,01:23:42.416,Rial killed it.
01:23:49.250,01:23:51.916,I think I might paint this room red.
01:23:54.708,01:23:55.791,Hm.
01:23:58.125,01:23:59.875,Are you completely mad?
01:24:03.166,01:24:04.583,What about the rats?
01:24:14.000,01:24:15.375,Do you still see her?
01:24:16.791,01:24:17.916,Nyagak?
01:24:23.541,01:24:25.166,Your ghosts follow you.
01:24:26.166,01:24:27.416,They never leave.
01:24:28.458,01:24:30.416,They live with you.
01:24:32.833,01:24:36.583,"It's when I let them in, I could start to face myself."
