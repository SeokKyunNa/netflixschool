00:01:28.625,00:01:29.875,She always has.
00:01:42.833,00:01:45.666,Mum met Dad on the beach when they were teenagers.
00:01:53.833,00:01:55.750,They've been together ever since.
00:02:11.375,00:02:13.083,That's me when I was four.
00:02:29.666,00:02:31.375,He's always been annoying.
00:02:35.625,00:02:36.583,And then Oli.
00:02:37.250,00:02:38.458,Lucky last.
00:02:40.666,00:02:42.125,And that's us.
00:02:42.208,00:02:43.166,The Blooms.
00:02:47.500,00:02:50.500,Everything was pretty much perfect.
00:02:51.750,00:02:53.500,But then last year happened.
00:03:09.750,00:03:12.333,But Mum and Dad chose Thailand instead.
00:03:21.541,00:03:23.166,I liked Thailand.
00:03:39.291,00:03:40.375,-Here you go. -Thank you.
00:05:29.666,00:05:31.208,"Stop playing, please."
00:05:32.166,00:05:33.041,Please.
00:05:34.708,00:05:38.000,"Rueben or Oli, can you go and see if Mum is okay?"
00:05:40.458,00:05:42.458,"-Yeah, yeah, you're overworked. -Noah should do it."
00:05:42.541,00:05:45.791,It doesn't matter who did it yesterday or the day before.
00:05:45.875,00:05:48.041,"I'm just asking you to check on Mum, please."
00:05:53.958,00:05:55.250,Uniforms.
00:05:55.333,00:05:57.666,"Pants… pants off, uniforms on."
00:05:57.750,00:05:59.791,-Stop it! -I'll have a whole-grain sandwich.
00:06:16.791,00:06:18.125,A bit of help down here.
00:06:19.041,00:06:20.000,'Kay.
00:06:37.916,00:06:40.958,"But at least there, she wasn't the only one stuck in bed."
00:06:54.083,00:06:57.083,…but what Mum calls her bra strap.
00:07:34.583,00:07:35.500,I'm okay.
00:07:38.125,00:07:39.916,"Can you close the door, please?"
00:08:06.708,00:08:07.583,Turn the TV off.
00:08:09.166,00:08:11.291,"Mum, I can't do my laces."
00:08:13.416,00:08:15.291,Dad knows how to tie the best knots.
00:08:20.333,00:08:21.916,"Oh, shit."
00:08:23.500,00:08:26.541,Can we buy our own lunches today? It's Friday.
00:08:26.625,00:08:29.250,"-Can I get a pie? -Ooh, can I get a sausage roll?"
00:08:29.333,00:08:30.750,"Yeah, of course you can."
00:08:31.916,00:08:36.000,You've only been home a little while. It will get better. I promise.
00:08:40.625,00:08:41.833,I love you.
00:08:41.916,00:08:43.375,I'll call you after drop-off.
00:08:44.208,00:08:45.583,Give us a kiss before you go.
00:09:17.791,00:09:24.666,Light westerly winds are bringing fantastic surfing conditions with waves around one to two meters.
00:09:24.750,00:09:31.875,Conditions will be better in the morning as ground swell mixed with those offshore winds should bring well-formed waves that break cleanly.
00:09:31.958,00:09:35.250,"So, if you can make the most of it, you'll have a cracking morning."
00:09:35.333,00:11:02.791,"Looking further ahead at another fine day tomorrow… Hello, darling."
00:11:08.833,00:11:09.666,Hi.
00:11:11.166,00:11:12.083,Hmm.
00:11:13.333,00:11:15.875,What are you doing sitting here in the dark?
00:11:15.958,00:11:16.833,Nothing.
00:11:19.416,00:11:22.125,You need some light and fresh air in here.
00:11:22.791,00:11:26.958,"Hmm, why don't you take your book out onto the lawn?"
00:11:27.041,00:11:28.708,Or do your exercises.
00:11:28.791,00:11:32.666,Remember what the doctor in rehab said. You've gotta keep your spirits up.
00:11:34.458,00:11:37.750,Or try one of those podcast thingies.
00:11:37.833,00:11:45.375,"I bumped into Bron in the supermarket, and she reckons she can be hanging out the washing and solving a murder all at the same time."
00:11:48.250,00:11:52.666,I'd love to have a special lunch when Kylie gets back.
00:11:54.375,00:11:55.208,Sorry?
00:11:55.958,00:11:57.458,"What did you say, darling?"
00:11:58.083,00:11:59.250,I didn't say anything.
00:12:00.458,00:12:02.500,"Oh, thought you did."
00:12:10.958,00:12:12.916,Didn't Cam change these sheets?
00:12:26.041,00:12:27.291,What's this?
00:13:32.125,00:13:33.791,Hey. Hello.
00:13:35.125,00:13:36.250,Are you okay?
00:13:50.583,00:13:52.291,Maybe you should've left it there.
00:13:52.375,00:13:54.250,"She would have died, Mum."
00:13:59.958,00:14:01.791,I just think it'd be better off at the vet.
00:14:04.583,00:14:09.750,"Well, says here a magpie's gender can't be determined until after a year."
00:14:09.833,00:14:11.708,"So, we don't know."
00:14:15.958,00:14:17.708,"Well, she needs a name."
00:14:19.333,00:14:20.583,"No, Cam."
00:14:20.666,00:14:22.166,"No names, please."
00:14:22.916,00:14:24.875,Got enough to worry about around here.
00:14:24.958,00:14:25.791,Penguin.
00:14:29.125,00:14:30.666,'Cause she's black and white.
00:14:30.750,00:14:31.958,"Oh, okay."
00:14:37.125,00:14:38.500,"No, how about Magician's Wand?"
00:14:43.208,00:14:46.125,Her name's… Penguin.
00:15:04.875,00:15:06.541,"It's all right, Penguin."
00:15:06.625,00:15:07.666,Shh.
00:15:32.125,00:15:34.541,It's like Mum was stolen from us.
00:15:37.708,00:15:45.125,"She used to surf with us, skate with us, play soccer in the sand with us."
00:15:48.166,00:15:49.375,She was awesome.
00:16:05.416,00:16:06.833,Did she just poo on you?
00:16:06.916,00:16:08.291,She needs a nappy.
00:16:12.125,00:16:13.083,I don't mind.
00:16:24.916,00:16:26.291,"Ignore him, Peng."
00:16:38.958,00:16:40.166,Can you feel this?
00:16:44.041,00:16:45.333,Can you feel this?
00:16:46.250,00:16:47.083,No.
00:16:56.791,00:16:58.208,Penguin's talking to you.
00:17:01.041,00:17:02.000,What?
00:17:02.625,00:17:04.333,Why don't you like her?
00:17:05.041,00:17:10.458,"She's a wild bird, which means she can't stay here forever. Right?"
00:17:17.375,00:17:18.208,She should.
00:17:18.291,00:17:21.125,"I made it like they said online, with bugs and stuff."
00:17:21.208,00:17:24.041,Why don't you try it? See what it tastes like then?
00:17:28.666,00:17:30.541,It was supposed to be a normal family portrait.
00:17:30.625,00:17:32.875,Turns out they all hate each other's guts.
00:17:32.958,00:17:35.958,"And mine too, apparently, so that was a bit of fun."
00:17:40.750,00:17:41.583,How are you?
00:17:42.291,00:17:44.083,How's the pain? One to ten?
00:17:46.333,00:17:47.166,I'm fine.
00:17:52.750,00:17:56.833,"Okay, so look, I was thinking we could have fish and chips for dinner."
00:17:58.416,00:18:00.750,-Can I bring Peng? -Of course you can bring Penguin.
00:18:00.833,00:18:01.916,"I could carry you, Sam."
00:18:03.083,00:18:03.958,No.
00:18:04.041,00:18:05.958,It's beautiful down there. Come on.
00:18:06.041,00:18:07.750,No. You guys go.
00:18:07.833,00:18:10.541,I'm… I'm gonna get ready for bed.
00:18:14.916,00:18:15.750,"Sorry, bub."
00:18:16.583,00:18:19.625,"Hey, bring me back a shell, okay?"
00:18:24.291,00:18:25.500,"-Oli, come on. -Yes."
00:18:38.291,00:18:40.833,Never ask me that question in front of the boys again.
00:18:48.500,00:18:50.291,I don't wanna have to lie to them.
00:18:56.416,00:18:57.250,Okay.
00:19:14.958,00:19:15.791,Don't.
00:19:46.500,00:19:47.333,Oli.
00:19:47.875,00:19:49.291,Give this shell to Mum.
00:19:52.916,00:19:53.833,"Hey, Peng."
00:20:06.541,00:20:07.750,"Or a yummy chip, Peng?"
00:20:29.583,00:20:30.791,Dad?
00:20:30.875,00:20:31.750,Roo?
00:20:33.416,00:20:34.833,"Cam, babe."
00:20:35.500,00:20:36.375,It's Rueben.
00:20:37.166,00:20:38.125,Something's up.
00:20:39.125,00:20:40.208,You okay?
00:20:46.000,00:20:47.750,"Oh, no, no."
00:20:47.833,00:20:49.125,Smells like oysters.
00:20:49.208,00:20:50.291,Cam?
00:20:58.541,00:21:00.666,Penguin nearly ate one of those.
00:21:02.625,00:21:04.625,"Get back, Snow, or you'll step in it."
00:21:04.708,00:21:06.708,"Hey, you're gonna be all right."
00:21:08.583,00:21:10.041,"Are you okay, Oli?"
00:21:12.416,00:21:15.875,It's all right. That's it. There you go. You've still got a little bit more there.
00:21:23.458,00:21:25.125,It's all right. You're okay.
00:21:33.125,00:21:34.291,"Ah, they're fine."
00:21:39.125,00:21:41.291,"Look, we should turn while you're awake."
00:21:41.958,00:21:42.791,Hey.
00:21:59.291,00:22:00.125,Sam?
00:22:01.375,00:22:02.750,"Hey, what's up?"
00:22:03.250,00:22:04.291,They're fine.
00:22:06.333,00:22:07.958,They used to call out for me.
00:22:18.833,00:22:21.541,What am I if I can't even be a mum?
00:22:34.708,00:22:37.208,I hate myself so much.
00:22:50.666,00:22:53.875,That's 20 million other people this could have happened to.
00:22:57.625,00:23:01.541,That's 40 million other hands that could have touched that fence.
00:23:03.958,00:23:06.708,A fence that was 15 years old.
00:23:09.708,00:23:14.500,"5,475 other days it could have broken."
00:23:19.208,00:23:20.583,But it waited for Mum.
00:23:49.000,00:23:50.125,Look what I found.
00:25:06.000,00:25:10.166,I just had the most awful dream.
00:25:14.833,00:25:15.791,I was drowning.
00:25:17.583,00:25:18.708,But it felt good.
00:25:20.000,00:25:21.458,Please.
00:25:21.541,00:25:22.583,Look at me.
00:25:23.833,00:25:26.291,I'm here. I'm here for you.
00:25:27.166,00:25:28.375,It's not enough.
00:25:30.083,00:25:31.291,"I'm sorry, Cam."
00:25:36.000,00:25:37.250,Even the boys.
00:25:48.083,00:25:49.041,-Hey-- -Just go.
00:25:49.125,00:25:51.750,Let me get you up into the shower.
00:25:51.833,00:25:54.416,"-No, I just wanna stay-- -You need to get up."
00:25:54.500,00:26:00.750,"It'll pass. Just-- No, I'm fine. I'm just… just wanna stay here."
00:26:02.125,00:26:02.958,Please.
00:26:03.625,00:26:05.250,Just get the kids to school.
00:26:17.583,00:26:19.875,"That was like a swimming pool of spew, Dad."
00:26:26.500,00:26:27.333,Mum?
00:26:27.916,00:26:28.750,Yeah?
00:26:32.250,00:26:34.083,She's still not eating very well.
00:26:37.083,00:26:37.916,Okay.
00:27:00.416,00:27:01.291,"Bye, Peng."
00:28:12.083,00:28:12.958,Shh.
00:28:25.791,00:28:28.208,"Fine, don't eat it then."
00:29:52.250,00:29:53.083,Bird?
00:30:52.416,00:30:54.708,"Hey, leave that alone."
00:31:06.833,00:31:07.833,Come on.
00:31:08.833,00:31:10.791,Come on. Out you come.
00:31:11.958,00:31:13.041,Come on.
00:31:20.083,00:31:21.500,"Okay, hold on."
00:31:24.541,00:31:25.625,Now where's she gone?
00:31:30.458,00:31:31.291,Bird?
00:31:32.500,00:31:33.500,Penguin?
00:32:00.500,00:32:02.083,"Oh, come here."
00:32:06.083,00:32:07.041,Oh no.
00:32:09.208,00:32:10.500,"Oh, little one."
00:32:11.750,00:32:12.708,Little one.
00:32:16.750,00:32:17.583,It's okay.
00:32:24.208,00:32:25.125,It's all right.
00:32:30.000,00:32:31.416,I'm not gonna hurt you.
00:32:33.291,00:32:34.125,It's okay.
00:34:08.375,00:34:09.416,"Thanks, Roo."
00:34:09.500,00:34:10.666,New recipe?
00:34:21.958,00:34:23.500,"How was school today, Oli?"
00:34:25.791,00:34:58.875,"um, stand on that thing under the play equipment, and then when two little kids jumped down, he grabbed them by their undies, pulled their undies over their, um, faces… Look at Peng."
00:35:11.958,00:35:14.458,"Ooh, lovers."
00:35:20.958,00:35:22.791,Just until she gets strong enough.
00:35:23.791,00:35:26.208,"She doesn't wanna be stuck inside, does she?"
00:35:45.333,00:35:47.208,And that's how they learn to sing.
00:35:51.666,00:35:55.625,I wonder if they dream of their mothers teaching them to fly too.
00:36:12.375,00:36:18.666,"Penguin got stronger and fatter… Almost there, Peng."
00:36:19.250,00:36:20.958,…but couldn't seem to fly.
00:36:23.958,00:36:25.458,Maybe 'cause we didn't.
00:36:38.583,00:36:40.916,"Look, Peng, it's the bird magnet."
00:36:53.291,00:36:56.166,"Want some, Penguin? Want some, girl?"
00:37:09.250,00:37:10.833,and not be able to fly.
00:37:15.000,00:37:16.666,"Hello, Roo."
00:37:19.250,00:37:20.583,"G'day, stranger."
00:37:21.875,00:37:23.041,"Hi, Aunty Kylie."
00:37:30.958,00:37:32.041,Whoo!
00:37:32.625,00:37:34.875,"-You're looking good. -Yeah, it was pretty amazing."
00:37:34.958,00:37:37.666,I just did lots of yoga. I didn't speak to anyone for weeks.
00:37:37.750,00:37:38.958,I didn't drink anything.
00:37:39.041,00:37:40.416,We should get Mum to go.
00:37:45.666,00:37:47.166,"No, I'm fine. Thanks, Mum."
00:37:47.250,00:37:49.750,What about some cheese and bikkies?
00:37:49.833,00:37:50.791,It's all good.
00:37:51.875,00:37:53.000,Nuts?
00:37:54.166,00:37:56.958,"Okay, great. That sounds perfect."
00:37:58.916,00:38:00.875,-Are you cross with me? -No.
00:38:02.291,00:38:05.583,Why would I be cross with you? I'm the one who told you to go.
00:38:05.666,00:38:10.208,So… I would kill for a glass of wine.
00:38:10.916,00:38:13.416,-When was the last time you went out? -I go out.
00:38:13.500,00:38:16.208,Yeah? Where? And not to the doctor's.
00:38:16.291,00:38:18.708,"I mean, when was the last time you just went out?"
00:38:20.083,00:38:22.083,"So, what do you say? Let's go for lunch."
00:38:22.166,00:38:24.333,That would do us a world of good.
00:38:26.083,00:38:27.083,"Come on, Sammy."
00:38:37.166,00:38:38.833,Can we please not park here?
00:38:39.833,00:38:41.541,"No, Cam gave me a sticker, Sam."
00:38:48.541,00:38:50.250,You're not a spastic.
00:38:50.333,00:38:52.833,-No one thinks that. -Oh my God. I wasn't saying that.
00:38:55.125,00:38:58.541,That was the correct term. I had a cousin who was a spastic.
00:39:02.666,00:39:04.458,"No, I'll get the chair."
00:39:04.541,00:39:05.666,I'll get the chair.
00:39:17.541,00:39:19.083,"-Thank you. -Great, thank you."
00:39:19.166,00:39:21.500,"So, what do you feel like, sweetheart?"
00:39:21.583,00:39:23.166,You've gotta have a glass of wine.
00:39:33.000,00:39:33.833,Hi.
00:39:34.333,00:39:35.291,How are you?
00:39:35.375,00:39:38.291,"-Yeah, good. -Oh, I know. I'm sorry, a silly question."
00:39:38.375,00:39:40.916,"-No, it's okay. -Came up to see you the other day."
00:39:41.416,00:39:43.291,"Oh yeah, right."
00:39:43.375,00:39:45.583,"Thanks, um… thanks for the flowers."
00:39:45.666,00:39:47.208,Kids loved the lasagna.
00:39:50.583,00:39:52.625,"No, it's okay. I get it."
00:39:53.208,00:39:57.041,"I just wanted to let you know that I'm here and whatever you need, I'm… you know."
00:39:57.750,00:40:00.500,"Maybe see you in a few weeks, yeah."
00:40:01.875,00:40:03.166,"What are you up to, Bron?"
00:40:03.250,00:40:04.291,-Oh yeah. -Oh.
00:40:04.958,00:40:08.208,"Same old, same old. Um, back on ward 20 in the hospital."
00:40:08.291,00:40:09.125,-Oh. -Yeah.
00:40:09.750,00:40:11.708,Kids' school fundraiser's coming up.
00:40:14.250,00:40:17.791,I'm just hanging out for Christmas. We'll head back up to Noosa.
00:42:23.708,00:42:25.833,-See what Mum wants first. -Ice cream.
00:43:01.541,00:43:04.583,"Yeah, no, I… I get it."
00:43:08.416,00:43:16.000,That you want… that you want to… …erase yourself.
00:43:17.041,00:43:18.291,Who you were.
00:43:20.708,00:43:22.541,"But you're still you, Sam."
00:43:25.875,00:43:28.416,-You are. You are. You are! -I'm not.
00:43:29.333,00:43:30.291,I'm not.
00:43:30.791,00:43:32.541,That is someone else.
00:43:36.000,00:43:41.125,I'm nothing. This-- It doesn't work. It just doesn't work!
00:43:50.458,00:43:51.833,"Look at me, Cam."
00:44:42.541,00:44:44.833,"Nearly there. One more. Come on, Noah."
00:44:48.416,00:44:49.583,There it is!
00:44:54.250,00:44:55.083,Cam.
00:44:56.208,00:44:58.208,"There you go. Come on, Noah."
00:47:02.500,00:47:03.541,Give it a go.
00:47:07.791,00:47:09.000,Next time.
00:47:20.291,00:47:22.291,Maybe we should try something different.
00:47:23.625,00:47:24.458,Oh.
00:47:25.083,00:47:26.083,What do you mean?
00:47:34.666,00:47:35.625,Are you serious?
00:47:36.416,00:47:37.750,You love the water.
00:47:38.958,00:47:40.208,You don't get it.
00:47:46.083,00:47:48.250,The worst that can happen is you'll be embarrassed.
00:47:53.250,00:47:55.958,"So, what do you need, Sam? 'Cause I'm running out of ideas."
00:47:56.041,00:47:58.000,"The boys and I, we're struggling."
00:47:58.083,00:47:59.583,"Oh, you're struggling?"
00:47:59.666,00:48:02.041,"Yes, it's all of us, Sam."
00:48:08.583,00:48:11.833,-I wanna walk the boys to school. -Let's go for a skate.
00:48:14.541,00:48:16.291,I want a day without pain.
00:48:50.625,00:48:53.166,Will one of you please clean up this mess?
00:49:32.250,00:49:33.375,Okay.
00:49:33.916,00:49:34.750,"Thanks, bud."
00:49:34.833,00:49:36.916,"No, don't lift me. Just fix my legs."
00:49:46.125,00:49:48.041,Just pull the chair.
00:49:55.958,00:49:58.041,"That's it, babe. That's it."
00:49:58.125,00:49:59.041,You got it.
00:50:03.750,00:50:04.791,"Go, please."
00:50:48.458,00:50:49.416,Peng!
00:51:02.083,00:51:04.208,Sammy! Sam!
00:51:06.250,00:51:07.541,Woo-hoo!
00:51:08.166,00:51:09.000,Sam!
00:51:11.375,00:51:12.916,I'm okay. It's fine.
00:51:19.833,00:51:21.500,You're not missing this.
00:51:21.583,00:51:22.833,-Is she flying? -Yeah.
00:51:29.750,00:51:30.791,You wait.
00:51:30.875,00:51:32.291,"-Yeah, go, Peng! -Go, Peng!"
00:51:36.375,00:51:38.166,"-Go, Peng! -Yes, Peng!"
00:51:40.583,00:51:41.833,"Go, Peng!"
00:51:41.916,00:51:43.708,"-Go on, Peng! -Woo-hoo!"
00:53:03.708,00:53:05.250,You must be the Blooms.
00:53:06.375,00:53:07.375,I'm Gaye.
00:53:10.500,00:53:13.375,-Cameron. We spoke on the phone. -Uh-huh.
00:53:13.458,00:53:15.916,Cameron tells me you're quite the surfer.
00:53:16.000,00:53:16.958,Was.
00:53:19.666,00:53:23.708,"And a mum. By the looks of these jokers, it couldn't have been a walk in the park."
00:53:25.625,00:53:27.125,You seem a bit nervous.
00:53:27.208,00:53:28.750,I'm in a wheelchair.
00:53:29.458,00:53:31.375,"Well, wouldn't you rather be in a kayak?"
00:53:35.958,00:53:38.208,"And, uh, pass the paddle to Sam, please."
00:53:40.791,00:53:43.833,"Yep. Okay, pull it out."
00:53:46.375,00:53:48.666,So I want you to practice paddling.
00:53:49.291,00:53:50.625,"Gentle hands, Cam."
00:53:54.333,00:54:01.500,"Okay, so I want you to think about it like it's swimming, except you're gonna scoop the water with the paddle instead of your hands."
00:54:01.583,00:54:04.375,Try and feel it on the blade until you get a good catch.
00:54:05.583,00:54:07.416,Yeah. Eyes straight ahead.
00:54:07.916,00:54:10.166,"You look to the side, you'll lean to the side."
00:54:11.583,00:54:12.416,Right.
00:54:14.166,00:54:16.541,"Yeah, flick it off at the side at the waist."
00:54:16.625,00:54:17.583,Good.
00:54:17.666,00:54:18.666,That's it.
00:54:21.375,00:54:24.083,"The more comfortable you are, the quicker you'll go."
00:54:33.458,00:54:36.208,Now we've come to the most important part of the lesson.
00:54:37.458,00:54:39.000,I want you to tip over.
00:54:39.875,00:54:42.208,-What? -You heard me. Get in there.
00:54:42.291,00:54:43.916,No way.
00:54:44.000,00:54:47.000,"What's the worst thing that can happen? You swim, don't you?"
00:54:48.000,00:54:51.166,You still have your arms. They must be good for something.
00:54:52.166,00:54:54.083,"Come on, it's like riding a bike."
00:54:54.625,00:54:55.833,I can't do that either.
00:54:55.916,00:54:58.208,"Don't make me tip you out, Sam."
00:54:58.791,00:54:59.833,You wouldn't.
00:54:59.916,00:55:02.458,"Oh, I tip people all the time. I'm known for it."
00:55:14.708,00:55:15.750,I can't.
00:55:16.416,00:55:17.333,Can't do it.
00:55:17.416,00:55:18.791,This is the easy part.
00:55:18.875,00:55:20.583,This is falling off the bike.
00:55:23.041,00:55:24.916,I said I can't!
00:56:59.666,00:57:02.208,"-Three, two, one. -Three, two, one."
00:57:40.666,00:57:45.958,"It'll soon be time for you to move out of home, girl or start paying rent."
00:58:00.125,00:58:03.416,You were incredible today. Gaye thinks you've got talent.
00:58:05.208,00:58:07.000,"Hey, thanks for pushing me."
00:58:08.791,00:58:11.166,And I'm sorry you have to live with this.
00:58:15.416,00:58:17.958,I consider myself the luckiest man alive.
00:58:18.041,00:58:19.250,"Oh, shut up."
00:58:21.458,00:58:22.333,How so?
00:58:25.416,00:58:31.083,Because for a night… I sat thinking I'd never see you again.
00:58:33.125,00:58:34.000,But I did.
00:58:35.250,00:58:37.125,"I do, every day."
00:58:48.083,00:58:50.666,I've been reading up on magpies.
00:58:52.083,00:58:55.208,Turns out they mate for life.
00:58:55.291,00:58:56.125,Really?
00:58:57.666,00:58:58.916,Totally monogamous.
00:58:59.625,00:59:00.625,One and only.
00:59:07.041,00:59:11.333,"Well, maybe that explains why they're so miserable and angry all the time."
00:59:14.208,00:59:16.791,-You are such a cheeseball. -You're crazy. Crazy.
01:00:05.083,01:00:06.250,Ah!
01:00:43.791,01:00:46.666,"Aw, thank you. Peng, my Peng."
01:00:48.833,01:00:51.125,"I didn't say that, did I?"
01:00:53.916,01:00:57.166,"-Let me in. -Three, two, and open fire!"
01:01:13.541,01:01:15.333,"What about you, Oli?"
01:01:19.000,01:01:20.375,Don't forget Penguin.
01:01:20.458,01:01:30.125,"Come on, Peng. Maybe I can get a… Mum loves the ocean. She always has."
01:01:35.583,01:01:36.541,-Mum met Dad-- -Hey.
01:01:39.041,01:01:40.166,What are you doing?
01:01:40.666,01:01:41.500,Nothing.
01:01:43.000,01:01:44.416,It's just a thing.
01:01:49.708,01:01:51.333,What sort of thing?
01:01:53.208,01:01:54.958,I… I can pack these up.
01:01:55.500,01:01:59.083,"Do you need any… I mean, I can help if you like."
01:01:59.666,01:02:01.250,No. It's fine.
01:02:02.625,01:02:03.708,I'll pack them up.
01:02:33.125,01:02:33.958,Hi.
01:02:35.666,01:02:36.541,"-Hey, Nan. -Hello."
01:02:43.458,01:02:46.500,"-Hi, Mum. -Hello, sweetheart. Happy birthday."
01:02:46.583,01:02:47.708,Thank you.
01:02:47.791,01:02:49.666,"-Quickly, quickly, carry. -Hurry. Come on."
01:02:49.750,01:02:51.375,"-Hide them, quick. -Come on."
01:02:57.500,01:02:59.916,"Oh, Sammy, you're so old."
01:03:02.958,01:03:04.458,"Uh, I'll wear it well."
01:03:04.541,01:03:08.125,"And I got you bubbles, but I got-- Look, I got the cheap stuff 'cause you can't taste it."
01:03:12.958,01:03:14.166,Kylie!
01:03:14.250,01:03:17.250,This table isn't gonna set itself. Come on.
01:03:21.083,01:03:23.958,I have waited over a year for this.
01:03:26.583,01:03:28.708,Oh no.
01:03:29.291,01:03:33.041,"Oh, I swear that bird does it to me just to annoy me."
01:03:43.416,01:03:45.166,"-Shoo, shoo! Shoo! -That'll be Gaye."
01:03:51.250,01:03:54.125,"-So, Gaye, you reckon Sam's got a shot? -Oh yeah."
01:03:54.208,01:03:57.458,"So, she'll be spending a lot of time in the water?"
01:03:57.541,01:03:59.208,"Yeah, training three times a week."
01:03:59.291,01:04:02.791,"It sounds dangerous. And Sam can't swim, can you?"
01:04:05.458,01:04:08.541,"But my ex-husband, well… that's a whole other story."
01:04:11.625,01:04:18.250,"You know, um, my… my students, they… they usually take a long time to find their balance… There you go, Peng, some fresh air."
01:04:22.041,01:04:25.500,"Honestly, it's the first time I've felt normal since the accident."
01:04:26.083,01:04:28.958,"When I'm kayaking, I look like everyone else."
01:04:31.750,01:04:34.375,"Someone's gotta get Sam out of the house, be proactive."
01:04:35.541,01:04:37.875,"Mum, what-- That's what Cameron does every day."
01:04:40.791,01:04:42.041,"I didn't mean that, Cam."
01:04:44.708,01:04:47.125,You've got your work. Sam's often alone.
01:04:47.208,01:04:49.375,"She likes her independence, Jan."
01:04:52.208,01:04:53.583,"I'm right here, Mum."
01:04:53.666,01:04:56.041,How much independence should she have?
01:04:58.583,01:04:59.416,Please.
01:05:01.916,01:05:04.583,"She has her phone, Jan. She'd call."
01:05:04.666,01:05:07.333,"Yeah, what if she fell or there was a fire?"
01:05:07.416,01:05:11.125,"Hey, boys! Um, how about you go jump in the pool?"
01:05:20.791,01:05:22.666,What if she couldn't reach her phone?
01:05:25.083,01:05:27.208,"We don't talk in what-ifs, Jan. We live our life."
01:05:29.166,01:05:33.083,All fun and no responsibility. Look where that's got you.
01:05:33.166,01:05:36.500,"-I might, uh, go for a swim as well. -Please sit down, Gaye."
01:05:36.583,01:05:42.375,"-It's fine. -And, Jan, if you're implying-- No, she's not implying. It's just… Leave her alone. She's drunk and emotional."
01:05:42.458,01:05:43.500,I heard that.
01:05:43.583,01:05:46.208,"Well, yes, of course. You're three feet away, Mum."
01:05:46.291,01:05:48.125,-When your poor father died-- -Oh.
01:05:51.750,01:05:55.666,"When your poor father died, I thought, at least I've still got the girls."
01:05:55.750,01:05:59.416,But now I just lie awake at night worrying.
01:05:59.500,01:06:00.458,And I don't?
01:06:00.958,01:06:02.333,All I ever do is worry.
01:06:02.416,01:06:06.750,I worry if I'm too happy in front of Sam or too sad in front of the boys.
01:06:06.833,01:06:14.750,I worry if I should take them to the beach or if that's us being selfish. I worry… I worry if I do too much for Sam or not enough.
01:06:15.750,01:06:17.958,I worry Sam can't walk because I moved her after she fell.
01:06:18.041,01:06:22.375,"No, darling, that's got nothing to do with it-- Believe me, Jan. I worry."
01:06:22.458,01:06:26.666,"I'm sorry, love. I'm just… I'm just scared."
01:06:27.375,01:06:29.958,"I wanna make my little girl well again, and I can't."
01:06:30.041,01:06:33.458,-And it makes me crazy. I just-- -Shh.
01:06:33.541,01:06:35.041,"Well, don't shush me."
01:06:35.125,01:06:36.041,"No, no, no. Shh."
01:06:38.208,01:06:39.583,Is that Penguin?
01:06:54.166,01:06:56.208,-What's happening? -Hey!
01:06:58.875,01:07:00.458,Penguin!
01:07:03.583,01:07:05.000,Penguin!
01:07:09.166,01:07:10.375,Penguin!
01:07:11.916,01:07:13.791,"Leave her alone, you mongrels."
01:07:13.875,01:07:15.041,Oh no.
01:07:15.125,01:07:16.041,No!
01:07:18.833,01:07:20.083,Peng!
01:07:36.875,01:07:37.708,Come on.
01:07:49.791,01:07:50.833,Penguin!
01:07:54.791,01:07:57.416,Not an umbrella amongst the lot of you.
01:07:57.500,01:08:00.166,We're about to head home. There's no point in this weather.
01:08:00.250,01:08:01.833,Maybe she's at the beach.
01:08:01.916,01:08:03.791,"It's getting dark, Snow."
01:08:03.875,01:08:05.833,"Just five more minutes, please."
01:08:05.916,01:08:07.708,You're all gonna get sick.
01:08:07.791,01:08:09.875,Let's give him five more. Go! Go!
01:08:12.208,01:08:13.500,Penguin!
01:08:17.125,01:08:18.416,Why did they do it?
01:08:19.291,01:08:21.041,Penguin wouldn't hurt anyone.
01:08:22.208,01:08:24.500,"Magpies are territorial, mate."
01:08:24.583,01:08:26.791,"Technically, this isn't Penguin's home."
01:08:27.291,01:08:28.208,It's theirs.
01:08:30.208,01:08:32.000,But we're her home.
01:08:32.083,01:08:34.375,"I know, sweetheart. I know."
01:09:52.416,01:09:53.666,But it waited for Mum.
01:09:55.500,01:09:57.708,And I'm the one who took her there.
01:09:59.916,01:10:02.583,I wish it was me who leant on that fence.
01:10:04.458,01:10:07.000,I wish it was me who broke my back.
01:10:45.333,01:10:46.958,Is it New Year's Eve?
01:10:49.583,01:10:50.500,No.
01:10:51.083,01:10:52.916,Then why are there fireworks?
01:10:53.958,01:10:55.000,I don't know.
01:10:57.666,01:11:01.750,'Cause sometimes nice things just happen.
01:11:09.416,01:11:10.750,Are you mad at Noah?
01:11:16.666,01:11:18.666,'Cause anyone could've let her out.
01:11:20.791,01:11:21.625,I know.
01:11:36.625,01:11:37.500,Peng!
01:11:39.083,01:11:40.375,Penguin!
01:11:44.500,01:11:45.875,Penguin!
01:11:53.666,01:11:54.583,Peng!
01:12:47.666,01:12:48.708,"You all right, Snow?"
01:12:54.250,01:12:55.875,Do you think she's dead?
01:12:56.666,01:12:58.583,"Jeez, Roo, no."
01:12:58.666,01:13:00.291,She's just scared.
01:13:01.041,01:13:03.875,Give her time to find her way home. She knows where we are.
01:13:04.500,01:13:07.125,"And Penguin's tough. Isn't that right, Sammy?"
01:13:07.208,01:13:08.041,Noah?
01:13:12.250,01:13:22.541,He's okay. He's just… You've gotta let it go.
01:13:24.000,01:13:27.583,"You're not to blame for Penguin, and you're not to blame for my accident."
01:13:33.416,01:13:34.750,Why do we have to talk about this?
01:13:34.833,01:13:37.208,Because I'm tired of not talking about it.
01:13:38.166,01:13:39.541,Please don't walk away.
01:13:43.041,01:13:46.375,"You say I'm not to blame, Mum, but you don't mean it."
01:13:47.666,01:13:49.458,"You don't know anything, Dad."
01:13:49.541,01:13:53.041,"-Hey, hey, that's enough. -You don't see the way she looks at me."
01:13:53.125,01:13:55.416,"-Inside voices, mate-- -Oh, shut up, Cam."
01:13:57.500,01:14:01.000,"Please, Noah, if you've got something to say, just say it."
01:14:04.791,01:14:07.583,Please. I need you to talk to me.
01:14:10.750,01:14:13.541,It's my fault we went up that tower. It was my idea.
01:14:13.625,01:14:15.583,I'm the reason you broke your back.
01:14:16.791,01:14:17.833,You happy?
01:14:18.916,01:14:20.708,"No, I'm not happy."
01:14:22.125,01:14:26.208,And sometimes I think I'll never be happy again but not because of you.
01:14:26.708,01:14:30.500,Then why don't you ever wanna talk to me or be near me?
01:14:34.708,01:14:36.291,-You can't look at me! -I'm scared.
01:14:36.375,01:14:40.250,I'm just terrified that all this anger will just come spewing out of me.
01:14:41.375,01:14:44.125,"Not just at you, at all of… all of you."
01:14:44.208,01:14:46.916,"Me too. You, Cam."
01:14:59.750,01:15:00.791,But we went.
01:15:02.458,01:15:04.916,That was our decision.
01:15:05.833,01:15:06.791,Not yours.
01:15:09.375,01:15:11.750,You're not to blame for any of it.
01:15:12.250,01:15:13.291,I promise.
01:15:14.375,01:15:16.416,"It was just a piece of old, rotten wood."
01:15:20.041,01:15:23.500,I'm sorry I haven't been strong enough to help you understand that.
01:15:25.333,01:15:26.541,Or help you through it.
01:15:27.833,01:15:30.791,I didn't think I was strong enough to get through it myself.
01:15:32.000,01:15:32.875,But I am.
01:15:34.708,01:15:35.916,And I know that now.
01:15:42.333,01:15:43.208,I'm here.
01:15:46.125,01:15:47.041,I'm your mum.
01:15:52.166,01:15:53.416,The same mum.
01:17:25.666,01:17:26.541,"Bye, sweetie."
01:17:31.916,01:17:32.750,See ya.
01:17:48.125,01:17:48.958,You too.
01:18:18.000,01:18:19.500,Okay then.
01:18:20.666,01:18:21.916,I give up.
01:18:22.000,01:18:23.541,What's this all about?
01:18:25.333,01:18:27.958,We're not spending another night staring at Penguin's basket.
01:18:28.041,01:18:29.708,We're going out for fish and chips.
01:18:30.500,01:18:34.583,And I need a blindfold to go to the beach?
01:18:34.666,01:18:36.708,"Well, who said anything about the beach?"
01:18:36.791,01:18:37.625,Boys.
01:18:53.750,01:18:58.000,It is not just Gaye. It's Gaye and Gaye's truck.
01:19:03.166,01:19:05.333,Don't look at me. No one tells me anything.
01:19:08.833,01:19:10.041,Your chariot awaits.
01:19:14.250,01:19:16.875,We're going out for fish and chips.
01:19:23.625,01:19:25.166,Only if you want to.
01:19:35.500,01:19:36.375,Okay.
01:19:37.625,01:19:38.458,Drive!
01:20:29.500,01:20:30.708,"Oh, Mama."
01:22:04.833,01:22:07.250,That was pretty sneaky.
01:22:23.166,01:22:24.541,Ask me that question.
01:22:29.458,01:22:30.375,Which question?
01:22:32.083,01:22:34.375,The one I told you never to ask me.
01:22:40.125,01:22:41.083,How are you?
01:22:50.708,01:22:51.583,I'm better.
01:22:55.166,01:22:56.250,"Thank you, Cam."
01:23:28.125,01:23:29.291,Could be another one.
01:23:36.500,01:23:37.333,It's not.
01:23:43.875,01:23:46.500,"-She's back! She's back. -Penguin, Penguin, Penguin!"
01:23:46.583,01:23:47.791,Penguin!
01:24:19.833,01:24:22.708,And I know she's not the person she wanted to be.
01:24:25.083,01:24:29.458,"But to me, she's much more than that."
01:26:14.458,01:26:15.291,Peng?
01:26:34.750,01:26:35.583,What is it?
01:26:39.708,01:26:40.875,What are you up to?
01:27:08.833,01:27:09.666,Thanks.
