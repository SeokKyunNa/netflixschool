01:10:21.317,01:10:25.454,Get those assholes in the chicken coop cleaned up.
01:10:26.322,01:10:27.957,If the guero's really U.S. Navy...
01:10:28.290,01:10:31.260,...you and I just might get 43 million dollars richer.
01:10:31.560,01:10:33.796,What about our friend from the CIA?
01:10:34.430,01:10:36.498,He can go fuck his mother.
01:10:36.732,01:10:37.967,"I like it, boss."
00:01:37.806,00:01:40.768,Hi.
00:01:40.768,00:01:42.978,How many?
00:01:42.978,00:01:44.521,Two.
00:02:12.257,00:02:15.928,"Listen, I wanted to get a safe-deposit box."
00:02:15.928,00:02:17.262,Can you do that for me?
00:02:24.895,00:02:27.397,Okay.
00:02:24.895,00:02:31.652,Your box will be available anytime from an hour after opening to 30 minutes before close.
00:02:31.652,00:02:32.903,Thank you.
00:02:32.903,00:02:37.866,"Also, if you open a checking account, we'll give you 5 percent off the box along with free overdraft protection."
00:02:37.866,00:02:40.577,Here I was hoping for a free toaster.
00:02:42.245,00:02:44.081,Why would a bank give out free toasters?
00:02:46.041,00:02:47.709,"Hello, Ma."
00:02:47.709,00:02:49.670,I'm ordering you the French toast.
00:02:49.670,00:02:52.589,"No, thank you."
00:02:49.670,00:02:53.966,Our patient waitress Maggie-- It says Maggie on her name tag.
00:02:53.966,00:02:55.550,--has asked me to order four times.
00:02:55.550,00:02:56.969,"If I don't order at this point, it's rude."
00:02:56.969,00:02:58.929,MAGGIE: I can come back.
00:02:58.929,00:03:01.389,You know what? I'm making an executive decision. Pancakes.
00:03:01.389,00:03:03.767,I don't like pancakes.
00:03:03.767,00:03:05.144,"What are you, a communist?"
00:03:05.144,00:03:07.104,Pancakes and a fried egg.
00:03:05.144,00:03:08.689,"I'm thinking hash, but only if it's like chunky style."
00:03:08.689,00:03:12.109,"Listen, if you order me eggs and pancakes, I'm gonna kick your behind."
00:03:12.109,00:03:13.652,STIG: But you gotta eat breakfast.
00:03:13.652,00:03:15.737,It's the most important meal of the day.
00:03:15.737,00:03:17.906,"Ma'am, ignore everything he said, okay?"
00:03:17.906,00:03:20.868,Don't bring me any eggs and pancakes.
00:03:20.868,00:03:24.163,Just bring me some coffee and bring him a couple eggs.
00:03:24.163,00:03:27.248,I don't want eggs. I want hash.
00:03:27.248,00:03:29.960,Give him some rye toast.
00:03:29.960,00:03:31.252,A pancake.
00:03:31.252,00:03:32.629,Maybe a little silver-dollar one.
00:03:32.629,00:03:34.173,You got the little baby ones?
00:03:34.173,00:03:36.299,"No pancakes, no silver dollars, no rye toast."
00:03:36.299,00:03:38.552,I like pumpernickel.
00:03:38.552,00:03:40.762,Pumpernickel toast.
00:03:40.762,00:03:42.806,MAGGIE: Yeah.
00:03:40.762,00:03:45.809,You take that with you till we see each other again in case you miss me.
00:03:47.352,00:03:49.312,Why you gotta do that?
00:03:49.312,00:03:51.148,Wink at the waitresses like that?
00:03:51.148,00:03:53.025,Waitresses like me.
00:03:53.025,00:03:54.401,So?
00:03:54.401,00:03:55.986,So.
00:03:55.986,00:03:58.446,So it is a sleepy bank.
00:03:58.446,00:04:00.407,Doable?
00:04:00.407,00:04:02.367,I told you.
00:04:05.913,00:04:08.082,STIG: That is a lot of doughnuts.
00:04:11.543,00:04:13.087,I'll be back with your hash.
00:04:13.087,00:04:15.214,"Maggie, your hot homemade doughnuts, they any good?"
00:04:15.214,00:04:17.216,Best in three counties.
00:04:17.216,00:04:20.301,Bring us three of those.
00:04:20.301,00:04:22.303,MAGGIE: All right.
00:04:24.056,00:04:25.557,"All right, time to make the move."
00:04:25.557,00:04:28.309,There's gonna be some sirens in this bitch.
00:04:28.309,00:04:29.811,I'm gonna go shake the weasel.
00:04:29.811,00:04:32.689,Shake the weasel.
00:04:32.689,00:04:34.900,"Good morning, sir. How are you?"
00:04:34.900,00:04:37.152,"Hey, Maggie."
00:04:37.152,00:04:38.486,I'm very sorry about my friend.
00:04:38.486,00:04:40.488,He was kicked in the head as a child.
00:04:40.488,00:04:42.741,He's really not that bad.
00:04:48.371,00:04:51.125,MAGGIE: What's going on?
00:04:51.125,00:04:53.501,"Okay, I'm just gonna have you all exit the building."
00:04:53.501,00:04:56.671,"It might be a false alarm, but just do it safely."
00:04:56.671,00:04:59.758,Thank you. Thank you.
00:04:59.758,00:05:01.969,Is everybody out? I'm gonna need you to step outside.
00:05:01.969,00:05:03.595,I'm gonna grab my friend.
00:05:03.595,00:05:05.346,We gotta pay our bill.
00:05:07.724,00:05:09.643,We should go.
00:05:09.643,00:05:12.771,Is that all you're gonna tip?
00:05:12.771,00:05:14.106,You gotta leave at least 30.
00:05:14.106,00:05:16.399,"No, you don't."
00:05:16.399,00:05:18.693,Maggie's about to be out of a job. Don't be cheap.
00:05:18.693,00:05:20.361,"Okay, there's 5. That's 7."
00:05:20.361,00:05:24.199,There you go. Come on.
00:05:24.199,00:05:25.617,What?
00:05:25.617,00:05:28.245,"Yes, I did."
00:05:28.245,00:05:30.247,How'd you say it?
00:05:28.245,00:05:32.415,Never rob a bank across from a diner with the best doughnuts?
00:05:32.415,00:05:33.959,BOBBY: That's correct.
00:06:04.489,00:06:07.408,Bobby.
00:06:07.408,00:06:09.203,Why don't you get something to eat?
00:06:09.203,00:06:10.453,Not hungry.
00:06:10.453,00:06:12.039,Sure you are.
00:06:12.039,00:06:15.625,We're here to do business.
00:06:15.625,00:06:18.212,"Well, I can be diplomatic."
00:06:18.212,00:06:19.921,JULIO: Bobby.
00:06:20.839,00:06:22.716,Wait here.
00:06:22.716,00:06:25.384,Somebody sitting here?
00:06:25.384,00:06:28.055,"Oh, well, you move your feet, you lose your seat, right?"
00:06:28.055,00:06:30.265,Lose your head too.
00:06:30.265,00:06:31.933,So where is Little Toro?
00:06:31.933,00:06:34.435,"All√≠, where you put him."
00:06:48.950,00:06:50.369,Let's play some dominoes.
00:06:50.369,00:06:51.995,Papi's ready.
00:06:51.995,00:06:53.454,Yeah.
00:07:01.420,00:07:03.006,Papi Greco!
00:07:03.006,00:07:06.218,I-know-a-guy Bobby.
00:07:06.218,00:07:12.015,"PAPI: Quick: an ostrich, a tank of ether, a '63 Impala convertible."
00:07:12.015,00:07:13.267,Make it a '64.
00:07:13.267,00:07:14.976,My side of the border.
00:07:14.976,00:07:16.436,I know a guy.
00:07:18.146,00:07:24.444,"What did I tell you? He never says no, never says maybe, never says I'll see what I can do."
00:07:26.071,00:07:28.573,BOBBY: Nice bull.
00:07:28.573,00:07:30.992,I hope he's a good breeder.
00:07:30.992,00:07:32.827,That's a shame about Little Toro.
00:07:32.827,00:07:34.913,Julio caught him skimming.
00:07:34.913,00:07:36.248,Oh.
00:07:36.248,00:07:37.958,That don't sound like Little Toro.
00:07:37.958,00:07:40.168,Is that for me?
00:07:42.212,00:07:45.173,Everybody skims a little cream.
00:07:45.173,00:07:48.551,Just because it's human don't mean you let it go.
00:07:48.551,00:07:49.970,Mm.
00:07:55.142,00:07:57.185,Nice lines. Good color.
00:07:57.185,00:07:59.646,That's right.
00:08:02.983,00:08:04.359,What you got for me?
00:08:08.447,00:08:10.490,Cash.
00:08:10.490,00:08:11.992,Cash?
00:08:14.619,00:08:16.371,"Supposed to be giving me 100,000 to deal."
00:08:16.371,00:08:18.581,"Why didn't you give me a $100,000 worth of cocaine?"
00:08:19.833,00:08:21.668,Where's the cocaine?
00:08:21.668,00:08:23.170,My buyer wants cocaine.
00:08:23.170,00:08:25.130,So let him buy cocaine.
00:08:25.130,00:08:27.674,That's what he's trying to do.
00:08:27.674,00:08:30.093,"I told him I knew a guy, therefore I come to you."
00:08:30.093,00:08:32.012,You the guy I know.
00:08:34.181,00:08:36.683,So take back the passports.
00:08:36.683,00:08:39.811,"After Little Toro, we're not taking on any new customers."
00:08:39.811,00:08:42.356,"Well, no disrespect, but I ain't no new customer."
00:08:42.356,00:08:44.816,You been dealing with me for a long time.
00:08:44.816,00:08:46.276,You keep the passports.
00:08:47.861,00:08:49.279,Keep the money too.
00:08:49.279,00:08:53.700,"When you're ready to give me the product, you give me the product."
00:08:51.239,00:08:55.576,"Till then, you owe me."
00:09:11.092,00:09:12.844,"It's not very sporting, man."
00:09:12.844,00:09:15.138,At least give the chickens a chance to shoot back.
00:09:16.764,00:09:18.183,"Hey, I'm just saying."
00:09:18.183,00:09:24.356,"If I'm gonna kill a defenseless animal, I'm gonna honor its sacrifice by grilling it into some tasty barbecue."
00:09:21.769,00:09:26.900,I'm not gonna torture it to prove I can't hit anything further away than my pecker.
00:09:26.900,00:09:28.818,Your cuate's a real junkyard dog.
00:09:28.818,00:09:30.278,Mm.
00:09:30.278,00:09:32.947,Where'd you two find each other?
00:09:32.947,00:09:35.825,"I threw him a bone one night, he followed me home."
00:09:37.244,00:09:40.080,"Hey, cowboy."
00:09:40.080,00:09:43.250,"You ever hear the expression, You got a face only a mother can love?"
00:09:43.250,00:09:44.709,That don't apply to you.
00:09:44.709,00:09:46.794,You're uglier than the devil's asshole.
00:09:46.794,00:09:49.047,Stig!
00:09:49.047,00:09:50.298,What are you doing?
00:09:50.298,00:09:52.592,"They're torturing chickens, man."
00:09:52.592,00:09:54.010,What are you eating?
00:09:54.010,00:09:55.303,A chicken.
00:09:55.303,00:09:56.679,It's not the same thing.
00:09:56.679,00:09:59.182,See that bag over there by the table?
00:09:59.182,00:10:00.725,Buffet table next to the potato salad.
00:10:00.725,00:10:02.394,"Yeah, the bowling bag."
00:10:02.394,00:10:05.272,Little Toro's head is in that bag.
00:10:05.272,00:10:07.065,Bullshit.
00:10:07.065,00:10:09.817,You know what?
00:10:09.817,00:10:12.904,"Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's go."
00:10:15.907,00:10:17.284,"Say it in English, you goat fuck."
00:10:18.535,00:10:20.078,Suck my chicken.
00:10:20.078,00:10:22.456,"Ha-ha. That's funny, coming from you, fat boy."
00:10:22.456,00:10:24.665,You ain't seen your pecker since you were a baby.
00:10:24.665,00:10:29.379,"Just because you put your finger in your belly button and brown shit comes out, don't mean it's your asshole."
00:10:29.379,00:10:31.381,What did you say?
00:10:36.761,00:10:38.888,Now dig them up and make some damn barbecue.
00:10:43.935,00:10:45.853,"STIG: Bye, chica."
00:10:45.853,00:10:47.522,BOBBY: Did you just wink at him?
00:10:47.522,00:10:49.357,"I did wink at him, because he's my bitch now."
00:10:49.357,00:10:51.776,Uh-oh.
00:10:51.776,00:10:54.195,That's good shooting.
00:10:59.659,00:11:01.744,"You know, Little Toro never did nothing to nobody, man."
00:11:01.744,00:11:05.540,We should rip off Papi's stash at the Tres Cruces Savings &amp; Loan.
00:11:05.540,00:11:09.419,Papi's guy delivers a briefcase full of money to Tres Cruces every two weeks.
00:11:09.419,00:11:11.379,That's gotta add up to 3 million.
00:11:11.379,00:11:18.761,"If Papi knew we were even talking about ripping off Tres Cruces, it would be our heads in that bag next to the potato salad."
00:11:18.761,00:11:20.930,Our two heads would never fit in a bag that small.
00:11:24.559,00:11:26.311,"STIG: Come on, let's hit the bank."
00:11:26.311,00:11:28.271,Little Toro was your friend.
00:11:28.271,00:11:30.398,BOBBY: So?
00:11:30.398,00:11:32.066,What if it was me?
00:11:32.066,00:11:33.776,What if it was my head Papi ran through the saw mill?
00:11:33.776,00:11:35.236,You wouldn't come after him?
00:11:35.236,00:11:37.238,You wouldn't kill him?
00:11:37.238,00:11:39.366,"He did that to you, I'd kill him. Know why?"
00:11:39.366,00:11:40.825,You're my people and there's a code.
00:11:40.825,00:11:42.577,"There is no code, first of all."
00:11:42.577,00:11:45.038,"You do whatever you gotta do, whatever it takes."
00:11:45.038,00:11:47.332,And second?
00:11:47.332,00:11:50.293,"Right, we're not people because you don't have people."
00:11:50.293,00:11:51.836,That's correct.
00:11:54.464,00:11:56.257,Purpose for your visit to Mexico?
00:11:56.257,00:11:58.092,Quail hunting.
00:11:58.092,00:12:00.470,My aunt in Tuba City had a heart attack so we cut our trip short.
00:12:02.305,00:12:04.807,Tuba City?
00:12:04.807,00:12:06.142,Nice place?
00:12:06.142,00:12:08.395,"Hellhole, but she's my favorite aunt."
00:12:08.395,00:12:09.646,AGENT: Don't move.
00:12:09.646,00:12:11.772,AGENT: Let me see your hands.
00:12:14.192,00:12:16.110,Tell us about your trip.
00:12:16.110,00:12:18.029,What's the big deal?
00:12:18.029,00:12:20.365,"You were down in Sonora, weren't you?"
00:12:23.284,00:12:27.622,You don't think Agent Jessup and the DEA know about you and Papi Greco?
00:12:27.622,00:12:29.790,They know you were at his ranch.
00:12:29.790,00:12:32.210,AGENT: Tell Agent Rees about Papi Greco.
00:12:32.210,00:12:35.589,Who?
00:12:35.589,00:12:38.883,"Well, who's that? Some Mexican Santa Claus or something?"
00:12:38.883,00:12:40.801,"Come on, Mr. Stigman."
00:12:40.801,00:12:43.888,I think it's in your best interest to cooperate.
00:12:43.888,00:12:47.016,"You need to stop playing the stupid card, all right?"
00:12:47.016,00:12:49.352,It's my intent to cooperate with whatever you need.
00:12:49.352,00:12:51.438,I know you're just doing your job.
00:12:51.438,00:12:53.398,Innocent folks get caught up in the system.
00:12:53.398,00:12:55.734,"Airlines don't lose your luggage on purpose, right?"
00:12:55.734,00:12:57.736,But everybody takes it so damn personal.
00:12:57.736,00:13:00.614,"Come on, Mr. Stigman."
00:13:00.614,00:13:02.823,"Well, what did you have in mind?"
00:13:02.823,00:13:05.118,Do you wanna help yourself?
00:13:06.244,00:13:08.496,Do I have to do it in front of him?
00:13:09.997,00:13:12.417,"All right, we're done here."
00:13:12.417,00:13:14.043,You gonna leave?
00:13:16.254,00:13:17.756,My God.
00:13:17.756,00:13:20.341,"How do you concentrate working with her, man?"
00:13:31.728,00:13:34.188,Five border agents are ripping apart your car as we speak.
00:13:34.188,00:13:35.814,They ain't gonna find anything.
00:13:41.488,00:13:43.072,Where did you hide the cocaine?
00:13:43.072,00:13:45.283,Can they hear us?
00:13:45.283,00:13:46.825,Can they see us?
00:13:46.825,00:13:48.411,Okay.
00:13:49.412,00:13:51.623,There was no cocaine.
00:13:54.375,00:13:55.834,You had a deal in place.
00:13:55.834,00:13:58.630,Five hundred passports in return for cocaine.
00:13:58.630,00:13:59.964,Right.
00:13:59.964,00:14:02.759,"Hey, Bobby."
00:14:02.759,00:14:06.346,"Good. Man, your boy Stig's a piece of work."
00:14:06.346,00:14:08.598,"He winked at you, didn't he?"
00:14:09.683,00:14:10.849,How did you know?
00:14:10.849,00:14:13.144,Bobby didn't get the cocaine.
00:14:13.144,00:14:14.521,DEB: What? What happened?
00:14:14.521,00:14:17.816,Papi offered me cash.
00:14:17.816,00:14:22.570,I told him to keep the passports so eventually he's gotta come up with the cocaine.
00:14:22.570,00:14:25.657,What about this guy you said you could flip? Little Toro?
00:14:26.700,00:14:29.118,I got him.
00:14:30.203,00:14:32.872,I don't know who you are anymore.
00:14:32.872,00:14:34.541,It's like...
00:14:34.541,00:14:36.626,It's like you're out on this limb.
00:14:36.626,00:14:38.712,And you been out there way too long.
00:14:38.712,00:14:40.505,And you're saying that to say what?
00:14:40.505,00:14:42.215,I don't like going to funerals of my men.
00:14:42.215,00:14:44.676,"Well, then don't come, boss."
00:14:44.676,00:14:51.766,"Okay? I spent the last three years of my life crawling through a Mexican sewer, trying to work my way up to get next to Papi Greco."
00:14:51.766,00:14:53.601,You can't take me off this now.
00:14:53.601,00:14:54.935,"Jessup, he's close."
00:14:54.935,00:14:57.063,You can't take me off this now.
00:14:57.063,00:14:58.898,Not now.
00:15:02.360,00:15:04.320,Two weeks.
00:15:04.320,00:15:07.281,"You don't flip Little Toro by then, I'm pulling you out."
00:15:10.410,00:15:11.994,We're done.
00:15:28.636,00:15:31.180,BOBBY: Think Jessup knows about us?
00:15:31.180,00:15:35.393,What us?
00:15:35.393,00:15:36.977,"Oh, I remember."
00:15:36.977,00:15:39.063,"Besides, I'm dating."
00:15:39.063,00:15:41.858,"Oh, right, right, right."
00:15:41.858,00:15:43.192,Mm-hm.
00:15:43.192,00:15:46.529,"...your imaginary boyfriend, Harvey."
00:15:46.529,00:15:49.574,"Uh... He's not my boyfriend, his name's not Harvey."
00:15:49.574,00:15:52.827,I like Harvey. It has a nice ring to it. Harvey.
00:15:52.827,00:15:54.913,"You don't get to be jealous anymore, Bobby."
00:15:54.913,00:15:56.831,Harvey.
00:15:56.831,00:16:00.251,You pushed me away.
00:16:00.251,00:16:02.253,Fuck you.
00:16:04.213,00:16:05.840,Little Toro's dead.
00:16:05.840,00:16:08.760,You told Jessup you were close to flipping him.
00:16:08.760,00:16:10.303,I was.
00:16:10.303,00:16:14.348,"When I got down to the ranch, Papi's boys was throwing his head around in a bag."
00:16:14.348,00:16:16.559,"Well, that's game, then."
00:16:16.559,00:16:20.271,"With Little Toro off the board, Jessup's pulling you out."
00:16:20.271,00:16:22.690,Not if you don't tell him.
00:16:22.690,00:16:24.358,That's correct.
00:16:24.358,00:16:31.240,That's why I need you to let me rob Tres Cruces Savings &amp; Loan.
00:16:31.240,00:16:33.868,You want to rob a bank?
00:16:33.868,00:16:36.370,It's his idea.
00:16:36.370,00:16:41.000,What I want is access to that money that Papi's got in the safe-deposit box.
00:16:41.000,00:16:44.337,No judge is gonna give you a blanket warrant for the boxes.
00:16:44.337,00:16:47.298,We don't need a warrant. Not if the money's evidence in a crime.
00:16:47.298,00:16:52.094,"We just trace it back to ownership, we got Papi on tax evasion, possible RICO."
00:16:52.094,00:16:53.638,Yeah?
00:16:53.638,00:16:56.140,And what about Stig?
00:16:56.140,00:16:57.350,He's a side dish.
00:16:57.350,00:17:02.689,"You bust him in front of the bank, he does 20 years in the penitentiary, you get a medal..."
00:17:02.689,00:17:06.400,The bank gets us Papi.
00:17:06.400,00:17:08.194,"And that's all that matters, right?"
00:17:08.194,00:17:11.280,"It takes whatever it takes, baby."
00:17:11.280,00:17:13.825,Did you ever really love me?
00:17:13.825,00:17:15.326,Hmm?
00:17:15.326,00:17:17.537,I really meant to love you.
00:17:43.479,00:17:45.231,Shit.
00:17:45.231,00:17:47.734,You don't have to knock.
00:17:47.734,00:17:49.944,"Yeah, good."
00:17:49.944,00:17:51.237,Let's hit the bank.
00:17:51.237,00:17:52.989,The Tres Cruces?
00:17:52.989,00:17:55.449,"Oh, shit."
00:17:52.989,00:17:57.201,I'm still spinning about how we got yanked out of line at the border.
00:17:57.201,00:17:59.286,So you in or you out?
00:17:59.286,00:18:01.455,"I'm in, yeah. It's just..."
00:18:01.455,00:18:03.917,Have you ever had anything like that happen to you before?
00:18:03.917,00:18:06.586,They were 100 percent convinced we were holding.
00:18:06.586,00:18:09.255,We would've if Papi hadn't welched on that coke.
00:18:10.423,00:18:12.299,So you're saying that to say what?
00:18:12.299,00:18:13.968,I'm saying it's only because you're hearing it.
00:18:13.968,00:18:15.929,You saying something.
00:18:15.929,00:18:18.305,I'm hearing it because you're saying it. What are you saying?
00:18:18.305,00:18:20.224,I think you're fucking playing me.
00:18:20.224,00:18:22.435,You wanna be played?
00:18:20.224,00:18:24.478,"I been at your hip for 10 months but after this, I think maybe you're playing me."
00:18:30.359,00:18:32.319,Ha-ha. I got you.
00:18:32.319,00:18:33.821,The corner of your eye was twitching.
00:18:33.821,00:18:35.531,The corner?
00:18:35.531,00:18:37.575,That was a wink.
00:18:52.673,00:18:55.093,"Yup, that's Papi's chubby little kid right there."
00:18:55.093,00:18:58.554,"Feed that motherfucker quesadillas-- Oh, my God."
00:18:58.554,00:19:01.057,BOBBY: She's chubby too.
00:19:01.057,00:19:03.601,"How does an old, fat, ugly fuck get a girl like that?"
00:19:03.601,00:19:05.519,Money.
00:19:05.519,00:19:08.188,"All right, here we go."
00:19:10.650,00:19:12.610,Same thing every two weeks.
00:19:12.610,00:19:15.279,Papi flies over the border with a briefcase full of cash.
00:19:15.279,00:19:17.073,Spends a week with the mistress.
00:19:17.073,00:19:19.742,Julio drives it out to the Tres Cruces Savings &amp; Loan.
00:19:19.742,00:19:21.911,Think they got 3 million in the bank?
00:19:21.911,00:19:23.621,Easy.
00:19:24.538,00:19:26.206,Bingo.
00:19:26.206,00:19:27.708,"BOBBY: Money, money, money, money."
00:19:27.708,00:19:29.669,"STIG: Oh, yeah."
00:20:12.378,00:20:14.672,BOBBY: Hit the diner and check out the doughnuts.
00:20:14.672,00:20:19.385,"I'm kind of more in a corned-beef-hash mood, to tell you the truth."
00:20:16.590,00:20:23.014,You never heard the saying: Never rob a bank across from a diner that has the best doughnuts?
00:20:23.014,00:20:25.141,That's not a saying.
00:20:25.141,00:20:27.143,"I get what you're saying, but it's not a saying."
00:20:27.143,00:20:28.728,It's a saying.
00:20:28.728,00:20:30.396,Let you tell it.
00:20:40.781,00:20:42.075,Make the move.
00:20:57.173,00:20:59.133,Bad DEA agent.
00:20:59.133,00:21:00.801,Am I bad?
00:21:00.801,00:21:03.679,I'm a bad girl?
00:21:06.306,00:21:10.853,"Stig decided to hit the bank tomorrow, 3:00."
00:21:10.853,00:21:12.438,Stig decided?
00:21:12.438,00:21:15.149,"Well, with or without me, he's going in."
00:21:15.149,00:21:16.776,I still haven't talked to Jessup.
00:21:16.776,00:21:18.152,Stig doesn't know that.
00:21:18.152,00:21:19.904,Three o'clock tomorrow he's going in.
00:21:19.904,00:21:23.032,"If we want Papi, I gotta go in with him."
00:21:24.867,00:21:26.869,"You're not even gonna give me a choice, are you?"
00:21:26.869,00:21:31.791,I'm giving you no other options as a way to protect you.
00:21:31.791,00:21:37.671,"Just have the troops meet me outside the bank, 3:05 when we come out."
00:21:37.671,00:21:40.258,3:05.
00:21:40.258,00:21:42.384,Even if you want to.
00:22:24.218,00:22:27.638,"TEEMO: License and registration, cowboy."
00:22:27.638,00:22:29.307,Cute.
00:22:30.724,00:22:32.726,"STIG: What's up, Teemo?"
00:22:32.726,00:22:34.394,"I miss you, man."
00:22:34.394,00:22:36.689,STIG: Got you a turkey burger.
00:22:36.689,00:22:38.024,Commander wants to see you.
00:22:38.024,00:22:39.566,"Yes, sir."
00:22:39.566,00:22:42.236,So half a mile from home.
00:22:42.236,00:22:45.531,"I got Bobby all wound up and ready to go, sir."
00:22:45.531,00:22:47.491,QUINCE: Ordnance you requested.
00:22:49.618,00:22:52.288,The admiral's proud.
00:22:52.288,00:22:56.250,"If the bank falls right, you can come in from the cold, rejoin your brothers."
00:22:56.250,00:22:58.418,Great. Be good just to put the uniform back on.
00:22:58.418,00:23:03.341,I didn't join the Navy to commit felonies and hang with drug dealers.
00:23:03.341,00:23:05.343,"I do what I do for the Navy, sir."
00:23:05.343,00:23:07.970,It's part of the admiral's plan.
00:23:05.343,00:23:10.514,"We get 3 million from the bank, we run cross-border ops on Papi and the other cartels."
00:23:10.514,00:23:12.641,"So tomorrow, clean and precise."
00:23:12.641,00:23:15.853,"Take all the boxes, nothing left undone. You got it?"
00:23:15.853,00:23:17.563,"Yes, sir."
00:23:17.563,00:23:20.274,Let's go.
00:23:24.611,00:23:26.780,"Hey, nice jacket."
00:23:24.611,00:23:29.449,"Hey, tell your mother she's gotta move out of my house at some point."
00:24:09.949,00:24:12.701,"STIG: All right, what do you want, clown or Frankie?"
00:24:12.701,00:24:15.079,Frankie.
00:24:29.218,00:24:31.387,"So, what did you do with the .22?"
00:24:31.387,00:24:33.680,Traded to my cousin for an espresso machine.
00:24:33.680,00:24:36.558,"BOBBY: You're gonna need special beans for that, right?"
00:24:36.558,00:24:40.229,"STIG: Uh-uh. You can reach for your firearm, but do it real slow."
00:24:40.229,00:24:41.688,BOBBY: Any other people in the building?
00:24:41.688,00:24:44.442,What is this?
00:24:44.442,00:24:50.030,"Instead of robbing the bank and letting you chase after us, we decided to come after you first. Let's go."
00:25:04.462,00:25:06.380,"Give me your gun, there."
00:25:06.380,00:25:09.300,Everybody sit down.
00:25:09.300,00:25:13.137,"Ladies behind the counter, keep your hands visible, not on the alarms."
00:25:13.137,00:25:15.764,"It's all right, girls."
00:25:15.764,00:25:17.850,Did we ask for the drawer cash?
00:25:17.850,00:25:20.102,"Come on, come on, come on."
00:25:20.102,00:25:21.561,"STIG: Let's go, on the floor."
00:25:21.561,00:25:24.731,"Hey, guard!"
00:25:26.025,00:25:28.277,"Look, I'm trying to be polite, all right?"
00:25:28.277,00:25:30.363,Just sit tight and this will be over soon.
00:25:30.363,00:25:31.905,Open the gate.
00:25:31.905,00:25:35.075,I don't have a key.
00:25:37.744,00:25:39.372,Easy.
00:25:39.372,00:25:41.999,"Lie again, it's gonna be more than a fucking problem."
00:25:41.999,00:25:44.335,"Get out there, now."
00:25:44.335,00:25:47.463,You good? I'm going in.
00:25:58.556,00:26:01.394,BOBBY: Shh. It's all right.
00:26:01.394,00:26:04.104,"WOMAN: Oh, Timothy."
00:26:04.104,00:26:05.689,"BOBBY: Hey, it's okay."
00:26:05.689,00:26:09.485,It's okay. Yeah?
00:26:09.485,00:26:11.778,Okay. Here you go.
00:26:16.283,00:26:20.037,Showtime!
00:26:34.760,00:26:36.845,Holy shit!
00:26:36.845,00:26:39.557,"Hey, Frankie, something's not right."
00:26:39.557,00:26:41.599,They're all stuffed with money.
00:26:41.599,00:26:43.519,You said there'd only be one or two.
00:26:43.519,00:26:45.312,Every single one of them.
00:26:45.312,00:26:47.814,I'm at 32 boxes and counting.
00:26:47.814,00:26:49.775,"Look, there's way more than 3 million."
00:26:49.775,00:26:52.861,And there's still a lot more here.
00:26:52.861,00:26:55.072,"Well, take them all."
00:27:03.414,00:27:04.748,"You go ahead, I'll get the rest."
00:27:04.748,00:27:06.333,All right.
00:27:06.333,00:27:08.710,BOBBY: Listen.
00:27:08.710,00:27:10.628,"May be gunfire outside, okay?"
00:27:10.628,00:27:12.756,"So if it hits, get everybody behind the counters."
00:27:12.756,00:27:14.967,This is for the jail across the street.
00:27:14.967,00:27:16.969,You let the cops out.
00:27:20.389,00:27:21.974,Come on.
00:27:54.590,00:27:56.509,That is a hell of a lot more than $3 million.
00:27:58.010,00:27:59.719,"How much, you figure?"
00:27:59.719,00:28:02.389,"We couldn't be the luckiest chumps on earth, could we?"
00:28:02.389,00:28:04.308,You feel lucky?
00:28:04.308,00:28:06.101,"I mean, this can't be Papi's money."
00:28:06.101,00:28:09.271,People are gonna chase us off the end of the earth for money like this.
00:28:09.271,00:28:14.485,"I hate to tell you this, Stig, but I got more bad news-- You take that hand away nice and slow."
00:28:14.485,00:28:17.237,Okay.
00:28:22.660,00:28:24.119,"You know I really like you, right?"
00:28:24.119,00:28:25.412,I like you too.
00:28:25.412,00:28:26.830,"No, you don't."
00:28:26.830,00:28:28.582,Nobody likes me.
00:28:28.582,00:28:30.334,I do.
00:28:30.334,00:28:32.002,You're not saying it because I got a gun?
00:28:32.002,00:28:33.837,Why don't you just put the gun down?
00:28:35.673,00:28:37.633,Shit.
00:28:37.633,00:28:39.968,Hot-dogging.
00:28:39.968,00:28:42.346,"I'm sorry, man."
00:28:42.346,00:28:43.639,What'd you do that for?
00:28:43.639,00:28:45.641,"Shit, man, I had to!"
00:28:47.934,00:28:49.562,It's a flesh wound.
00:28:49.562,00:28:56.527,"Drink the water, and you'll be able-- What is that?"
00:28:56.527,00:28:59.405,In your hand.
00:29:01.073,00:29:03.909,"Tell me you're not a no-good, two-timing son of a bitch."
00:29:03.909,00:29:05.536,Tell me.
00:29:07.496,00:29:08.997,DEA.
00:29:08.997,00:29:12.209,"Hey, wait a minute."
00:29:12.209,00:29:14.836,"No, you wait a minute."
00:29:14.836,00:29:16.589,BOBBY: Stig.
00:29:19.633,00:29:21.218,Hey.
00:29:32.896,00:29:46.118,"EARL: The United States is the greatest country in the world because we accept a man is, at his core, greedy, selfish and covetous."
00:29:46.118,00:29:48.746,I had no choice.
00:29:48.746,00:29:50.623,I would never willingly open the vault.
00:29:50.623,00:29:52.958,"Keep your hands on the desk, please."
00:29:52.958,00:29:57.421,"In America, we line everybody up, say, You're on your own."
00:29:57.421,00:29:59.172,Grab all you can grab.
00:29:59.172,00:30:00.716,I'm innocent.
00:30:02.301,00:30:05.095,"Nobody's innocent, friend."
00:30:05.095,00:30:12.018,"There's just the guilty, the ignorant and the unlucky."
00:30:17.608,00:30:19.735,Did you take our money?
00:30:21.236,00:30:24.072,You fellas look like you're waiting for a bus.
00:30:24.072,00:30:25.574,You let us know when you're done.
00:30:25.574,00:30:28.827,"Oh, I'm done and thank you for the courtesy."
00:30:28.827,00:30:30.162,Who is that guy?
00:30:30.162,00:30:31.747,You heard of the hidden hand of God?
00:30:31.747,00:30:34.040,"Well, that's God's son of a bitch."
00:30:35.292,00:30:40.130,Call the DDO and get a list of everyone who knew we had money in this bank.
00:30:40.130,00:30:43.801,You two realize those sunglasses make you look like assholes.
00:30:43.801,00:30:46.470,"Excuse me, when did that diner burn?"
00:30:46.470,00:30:47.721,Yesterday.
00:30:47.721,00:30:50.849,I want interviews with the waitstaff and every customer.
00:30:50.849,00:30:53.018,It was just a grease fire.
00:30:53.018,00:30:56.522,"Did I ask your opinion, Gomer?"
00:30:56.522,00:31:02.277,"You ever hear the saying, Never rob a bank across from a diner with the best doughnuts in three counties?"
00:31:02.277,00:31:07.366,"If that diner fire's a coincidence, it's only because we ain't looking hard enough."
00:31:17.209,00:31:19.712,That is an impressive amount of greenbacks.
00:31:19.712,00:31:23.757,"Forty-three million, one hundred twenty-five thousand of them, sir."
00:31:23.757,00:31:26.176,Recount it. Pack it up.
00:31:26.176,00:31:29.221,"We were supposed to come out of that bank with 3 million at most, sir."
00:31:29.221,00:31:31.890,Mm-hm.
00:31:33.016,00:31:34.768,Bad men unworthy of it.
00:31:35.935,00:31:37.979,Did you know Bobby Beans was DEA?
00:31:37.979,00:31:40.065,"No, I didn't."
00:31:40.065,00:31:42.693,"No offense, sir, but you need to work on your surprised face."
00:31:42.693,00:31:46.780,"Well, if he was DEA, he helped you rob a bank."
00:31:46.780,00:31:49.324,Which means he's dirty and for that I have no mercy.
00:31:51.034,00:31:52.911,Where did you leave him?
00:31:52.911,00:31:55.455,Is he dead?
00:31:57.999,00:32:00.794,More than likely.
00:32:00.794,00:32:02.421,You wanna tell me what that means?
00:32:02.421,00:32:07.801,The point of you working with Bobby Beans was to kill him and create a cut-out so the op couldn't get traced back to us.
00:32:07.801,00:32:09.553,There's no way-- What?
00:32:09.553,00:32:12.264,My cover is solid.
00:32:12.264,00:32:14.474,That's a call made above your pay grade.
00:32:16.184,00:32:17.394,"Yes, sir."
00:32:21.022,00:32:24.818,Assign two of the boys to stow the money back at the base.
00:32:24.818,00:32:27.279,The rest will come check on the body of Mr. Beans.
00:32:27.279,00:32:29.489,"Stigman, wanna come with me?"
00:33:02.397,00:33:04.316,"Hey there, buddy."
00:33:04.316,00:33:05.525,You habla?
00:33:05.525,00:33:08.069,"Yeah, yeah. I, uh..."
00:33:08.069,00:33:09.529,"Good, that's good."
00:33:09.529,00:33:11.657,Don't trust in him till you see his papers.
00:33:11.657,00:33:14.200,"If he's got papers, I'll see his papers."
00:33:14.200,00:33:15.494,"You got papers, right?"
00:33:15.494,00:33:17.663,"No. No, I got no papers."
00:33:17.663,00:33:19.539,"Well, that's gonna be a problem."
00:33:19.539,00:33:26.922,"Slim Jay and me, we done assigned ourselves protection this here stretch of the border."
00:33:26.922,00:33:29.466,So we really gonna have to see your papers.
00:33:29.466,00:33:31.760,Make sure you ain't no Muslim or nothing.
00:33:34.304,00:33:37.516,"Oh, yeah."
00:33:37.516,00:33:40.059,Assalamu alaikum.
00:33:40.059,00:33:42.145,And let me have your gun.
00:33:45.524,00:33:47.275,Give it to me.
00:33:49.945,00:33:51.237,You know how to pray?
00:34:06.378,00:34:09.506,"QUINCE: Teemo. How we doing, boys?"
00:34:09.506,00:34:11.633,Any sign of Bobby Beans?
00:34:11.633,00:34:13.552,Checked all the washes to the southeast.
00:34:13.552,00:34:15.470,No sign of a body.
00:34:17.514,00:34:19.933,All right.
00:34:19.933,00:34:22.895,"Well, Stig, you put us in quite a hole."
00:34:22.895,00:34:25.856,"I don't see it that way, but you're the man with the oak leaves."
00:34:25.856,00:34:28.149,All that pride I had in you.
00:34:28.149,00:34:29.943,That loyalty?
00:34:29.943,00:34:32.404,You just tossed it to the wind.
00:34:43.456,00:34:44.791,Goddamn it.
00:34:49.755,00:34:51.464,TEEMO: He's in the wash!
00:34:51.464,00:34:53.466,"Go, go, go!"
00:34:59.723,00:35:02.059,"Come on, let's flush him out!"
00:35:12.235,00:35:14.362,"QUINCE: Where you going, Stigman?"
00:35:16.782,00:35:18.408,It doesn't matter if you run.
00:35:20.159,00:35:24.247,"Your jacket's wired, so you're six months AWOL after stabbing an MP."
00:35:25.540,00:35:28.752,"Talk to anyone, they're gonna hand you right back over to me."
00:35:36.509,00:35:37.761,You all right?
00:35:37.761,00:35:40.346,Yeah.
00:35:50.315,00:35:51.608,Toss the gun.
00:36:00.366,00:36:01.743,Aah! Fuck!
00:36:02.744,00:36:04.203,QUINCE: Move!
00:36:20.178,00:36:21.554,"Come on, come on!"
00:36:25.224,00:36:26.768,Damn it!
00:36:52.836,00:36:56.673,Jesus! What am I supposed to do with this?
00:36:58.091,00:36:59.759,Man. Oh.
00:36:59.759,00:37:01.678,Come on.
00:37:01.678,00:37:04.597,"I'm a vet, not a trauma surgeon."
00:37:04.597,00:37:07.059,"I can't help you with this, man. You gotta go."
00:37:07.059,00:37:08.351,Go where?
00:37:08.351,00:37:10.103,You gotta leave.
00:37:10.103,00:37:14.983,"Kenny, you remember a couple of months ago, you offered to sell me 500 hits of ketamine?"
00:37:14.983,00:37:16.693,You said you weren't interested.
00:37:16.693,00:37:19.529,Right.
00:37:22.448,00:37:33.251,"And if you don't fix me up, I'm gonna go to the DA, I'm gonna tell them that you like cruising Tori Amos concerts, selling Special K to little weepy college girls."
00:37:33.251,00:37:34.669,KENNY: There's no way you're a cop.
00:37:34.669,00:37:36.004,No?
00:37:36.004,00:37:37.714,You sure?
00:37:40.299,00:37:41.885,You have the right to remain silent.
00:37:41.885,00:37:43.720,Mm-hm.
00:37:41.885,00:37:45.263,You have the right to have a lawyer present during questioning.
00:37:45.263,00:37:46.556,Do I need to keep going?
00:37:46.556,00:37:48.266,"No, I'm good."
00:37:48.266,00:37:50.060,Okay.
00:37:51.061,00:37:52.478,Nice shirt.
00:37:52.478,00:37:54.106,Thanks. It's JCPenney's.
00:37:54.106,00:37:55.481,Yeah?
00:37:55.481,00:37:57.025,"All right, hold on one second."
00:38:32.185,00:38:35.188,Welcome to the Camino Real.
00:38:44.823,00:38:46.283,Hey.
00:38:46.283,00:38:47.951,You were late.
00:38:47.951,00:38:49.244,What the hell happened?
00:38:49.244,00:38:52.247,Excuse us.
00:38:52.247,00:38:54.249,I robbed a bank.
00:38:54.249,00:38:55.834,I was there with six agents at 3:05.
00:38:55.834,00:38:57.460,"No, you weren't."
00:38:57.460,00:38:59.754,You were late.
00:38:59.754,00:39:04.092,It's not as if you couldn't have pulled your badge and stopped it.
00:39:04.092,00:39:06.261,What?
00:39:06.261,00:39:08.180,We gotta take you to the hospital.
00:39:08.180,00:39:10.598,Interrupt your rendezvous with Harvey? I don't think so.
00:39:10.598,00:39:14.811,"This is what we need to do: We need to find Stig, we need to find the money."
00:39:19.149,00:39:20.358,All right. Listen.
00:39:20.358,00:39:24.362,"Let me go upstairs, make my excuses, then we'll find Stig together, okay?"
00:39:24.362,00:39:26.405,"Okay, let's do this."
00:39:26.405,00:39:28.366,Why don't you recheck Stig's background?
00:39:28.366,00:39:30.368,Maybe there was something that we missed.
00:39:30.368,00:39:34.164,"I'm going to Stig's apartment, see what I can find out."
00:39:34.164,00:39:36.499,All right?
00:39:39.377,00:39:41.004,Tell Harvey I said hi.
00:39:49.470,00:39:50.763,Who'd you patch up?
00:39:52.849,00:39:54.976,What are you talking about?
00:39:54.976,00:39:57.562,What am I talking about?
00:39:57.562,00:40:03.568,"Well, there's a dune buggy parked out back that was stolen by a man with a bullet hole in him."
00:40:03.568,00:40:10.616,"Now, before he had a bullet hole in him, he burned down a diner and robbed a bank."
00:40:10.616,00:40:13.119,"I don't know anything about that, so..."
00:40:14.620,00:40:16.081,Okay.
00:40:16.081,00:40:19.084,Okay?
00:40:20.085,00:40:21.378,"Say, let me ask you something."
00:40:21.378,00:40:23.213,Hm?
00:40:23.213,00:40:26.383,You ever play Russian roulette?
00:40:28.176,00:40:31.721,Of course not. Heh.
00:40:31.721,00:40:38.311,"The thing is, most people, they put the gun to the temple."
00:40:38.311,00:40:41.647,"And that's, well, that's just stupid."
00:40:41.647,00:40:43.649,What if...
00:40:45.985,00:40:48.529,the bullet's in the first chamber?
00:40:50.365,00:40:55.494,You blow a man's head off before he's had a chance to tell you what you want to know.
00:40:59.124,00:41:00.666,"Oh, no. No, no."
00:41:05.255,00:41:06.672,Case in point.
00:41:10.302,00:41:11.928,Stig!
00:41:22.981,00:41:25.608,Stig.
00:41:35.076,00:41:36.995,"STIG: Pick up, Bobby."
00:41:38.371,00:41:41.124,"What the fuck are you doing here, Bobby?"
00:41:44.377,00:41:46.296,"What are you ducking for, man?"
00:41:46.296,00:41:48.714,"You know I set you up, right?"
00:41:48.714,00:41:50.633,They told me all about you.
00:41:50.633,00:41:54.471,Tough cat. Knows everybody.
00:41:54.471,00:41:57.390,"That guy? Well, shit, that guy's a perfect cut-out."
00:41:57.390,00:41:59.642,"I mean, he takes a bullet, who's gonna care, right?"
00:42:01.186,00:42:02.561,Pick up the phone.
00:42:02.561,00:42:04.689,"Pick up the damn phone, Bobby."
00:42:11.070,00:42:12.905,You got anything to say?
00:42:11.070,00:42:15.408,"First question: If you're DEA and you're clean, why are you here alone?"
00:42:15.408,00:42:17.576,"Where's your backup, Bobby?"
00:42:19.120,00:42:22.665,It's this kind of attitude makes me think you're not one of the good guys.
00:42:24.459,00:42:28.796,"If I wanted you, I could've had you before you walked in that building, Bobby."
00:42:35.845,00:42:38.431,"That's a beautiful rifle, Stig."
00:42:42.852,00:42:44.603,Is that Army issue?
00:42:44.603,00:42:47.357,"You like that? No, it's K-Mart."
00:42:47.357,00:42:49.608,Now answer my question.
00:42:49.608,00:42:52.070,"BOBBY: No, no, that's a military rifle."
00:42:52.070,00:42:54.906,"What's the military doing robbing banks, Stig?"
00:42:56.491,00:42:58.451,"Can we just have a straight-up conversation, Bobby?"
00:42:58.451,00:43:00.245,I got you dead to rights.
00:43:00.245,00:43:03.415,Yeah? So shoot me.
00:43:03.415,00:43:04.832,Again.
00:43:06.334,00:43:07.835,No?
00:43:08.878,00:43:10.713,I'll shoot myself.
00:43:16.802,00:43:19.013,STIG: Huh. Not bad.
00:43:19.013,00:43:20.806,I'm glad you're impressed.
00:43:20.806,00:43:23.059,Were you testing me to see if I would shoot first?
00:43:24.394,00:43:25.853,"Where's the money, Stig?"
00:43:25.853,00:43:29.441,"If I thought you were clean, I might tell you, but I don't, so I can't."
00:43:29.441,00:43:31.150,"You don't have it, do you?"
00:43:32.360,00:43:34.362,"STIG: Oh, shit."
00:43:34.362,00:43:36.155,STIG: You're not the only one I was expecting.
00:43:36.155,00:43:37.698,Three nasty men showed up.
00:43:37.698,00:43:39.284,"If they find you in my place, they will get ugly."
00:43:39.284,00:43:41.035,Who are they?
00:43:41.035,00:43:43.621,"Yesterday, they were family."
00:43:43.621,00:43:45.540,I understand the feeling.
00:43:45.540,00:43:47.500,Fuck you. What do you know?
00:43:47.500,00:43:50.545,That's a stupid idea. They're coming up the stairs. Bobby!
00:44:03.766,00:44:07.979,"STIG: I told you. Now, Bobby, hang up the speaker, and answer your cell phone, okay?"
00:44:07.979,00:44:19.407,"If you want me to help you out, lis-- STIG: Just stay in the shadows, okay?"
00:44:19.407,00:44:21.033,I'm gonna guide you out from there.
00:44:22.410,00:44:23.953,Wait.
00:44:25.121,00:44:26.414,Wait.
00:44:31.836,00:44:34.255,He's coming up your rear.
00:44:34.255,00:44:36.799,Go into the bedroom and hide behind the lockers. Go.
00:44:43.014,00:44:46.601,"All right, Bobby, you're gonna wanna scoot across the hall. Go."
00:44:56.777,00:45:12.001,"Bobby, Bob-- Shit."
00:45:21.344,00:45:23.388,MINI: Teemo!
00:45:28.601,00:45:30.102,TEEMO: Target's on the move!
00:45:37.276,00:45:38.819,"Sorry, Teemo."
00:46:26.033,00:46:27.993,Where's our money?
00:46:29.328,00:46:31.997,I have no idea what you're talking about.
00:46:31.997,00:46:36.711,"You think DEA can just waltz into our bank, steal our money, and we're not gonna kick?"
00:46:39.004,00:46:42.675,Your man Bobby Trench stole 43 million of our dollars.
00:46:42.675,00:46:44.719,We'd like it back.
00:46:44.719,00:46:46.721,Because it's our money.
00:46:46.721,00:46:49.890,Because it's a blatant act of disrespect.
00:46:49.890,00:46:52.518,And because it's our money.
00:46:59.816,00:47:01.319,"DEB: Please tell me it's you, Bobby."
00:47:01.319,00:47:03.488,Anything new on Stig?
00:47:03.488,00:47:06.324,He's coming up clean on every database I'm cleared for.
00:47:06.324,00:47:08.867,No military connection?
00:47:08.867,00:47:11.496,"To go deeper, I'd need to get clearance from Jessup."
00:47:11.496,00:47:14.666,"Well, try your old contacts in the military."
00:47:14.666,00:47:16.751,I'm gonna tell Jessup everything I know.
00:47:16.751,00:47:18.586,"Wait, are you sure?"
00:47:18.586,00:47:20.755,BOBBY: Someone has to know whose money was in the bank.
00:47:20.755,00:47:22.173,Yeah. Stig.
00:47:22.173,00:47:23.882,Stig didn't even know I was DEA.
00:47:23.882,00:47:26.469,"Besides, somebody tried to kill him too."
00:47:26.469,00:47:28.387,Let me help you.
00:47:28.387,00:47:29.930,Take it easy. Bye.
00:47:29.930,00:47:31.432,Bobby.
00:47:31.432,00:47:32.767,Fuck!
00:47:53.996,00:47:57.291,That's how you take down a man.
00:48:06.467,00:48:08.302,Just let it come.
00:48:14.308,00:48:16.352,Agent Robert Lynn Trench.
00:48:16.352,00:48:21.733,"A.k.a. Bobby T, a.k.a. Bobby B, a.k.a. Bobby Beans."
00:48:25.277,00:48:27.363,Let's have a chat.
00:48:46.549,00:48:54.014,You stole $43.125 million that did not belong to you.
00:48:54.014,00:49:01.230,"Now, man-to-man, who at DEA authorized you to rob our bank?"
00:49:02.732,00:49:04.567,You a banker?
00:49:07.152,00:49:09.906,You ever play Russian roulette?
00:49:12.241,00:49:18.205,"Thing is, most people put the gun to the temple."
00:49:19.791,00:49:22.042,"Well, that's just stupid."
00:49:27.214,00:49:32.553,You blow a man's head off before he's had a chance to tell you what you wanna know.
00:49:32.553,00:49:34.889,Mess up your suit too.
00:49:52.615,00:49:54.991,Who told you it was all right to take our money?
00:49:56.160,00:49:58.704,Our money. Our bank.
00:50:00.539,00:50:01.666,Who are you?
00:50:01.666,00:50:07.672,"If you don't know who I am, how did you know to steal our 43 million?"
00:50:07.672,00:50:09.548,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:50:09.548,00:50:11.717,You don't?
00:50:11.717,00:50:14.470,Well...
00:50:14.470,00:50:15.888,Where's the money?
00:50:15.888,00:50:18.223,"Oh, boy."
00:50:18.223,00:50:23.813,"Well, uh, it ain't down there, I can guarantee you that."
00:50:33.823,00:50:37.618,Heh. Ah-heh.
00:50:37.618,00:50:39.328,A.k.a. Bobby Balls.
00:50:39.328,00:50:42.122,Clean and shaven.
00:50:52.132,00:50:54.218,You know what you are?
00:50:56.762,00:50:58.973,You...
00:50:58.973,00:51:02.100,are a dirty DEA agent.
00:51:02.100,00:51:03.811,That's right.
00:51:03.811,00:51:07.523,You're a dirty DEA agent who robbed a bank.
00:51:07.523,00:51:09.734,And shot your boss.
00:51:22.872,00:51:28.669,You walk into any federal office and that's the story they're gonna have.
00:51:31.923,00:51:42.016,Unless you bring me $43.125 million and you walk away.
00:51:43.893,00:51:47.980,Have I properly incentivized you?
00:51:47.980,00:51:50.066,More than you know.
00:51:50.066,00:51:54.361,"Unless you wanna rot in jail, you best get after it."
00:51:58.198,00:52:01.159,"Go on, now. Go on."
00:52:09.710,00:52:11.629,All right.
00:52:16.550,00:52:18.427,You're thinking he deserved better?
00:52:18.427,00:52:20.805,You're right.
00:52:43.702,00:52:45.621,"JAVIER: Hey, Rudy."
00:52:45.621,00:52:47.414,"Hola, Javier."
00:52:56.048,00:52:58.550,"Morning, Papi. Don't move."
00:52:58.550,00:53:01.095,"Go inside, quick."
00:53:01.095,00:53:02.638,Whose money did we steal?
00:53:02.638,00:53:05.223,You really wanna know?
00:53:12.481,00:53:14.900,"Easy, old man, get in there."
00:53:14.900,00:53:16.318,PAPI: Payback's a bitch!
00:53:17.987,00:53:19.237,Payback's a bitch!
00:53:19.237,00:53:20.698,BOBBY: Uh-uh-uh.
00:53:20.698,00:53:22.533,"Whoa, Bobby."
00:53:22.533,00:53:24.284,Give me the keys.
00:53:24.284,00:53:25.577,I can't do that.
00:53:25.577,00:53:27.203,Why not?
00:53:27.203,00:53:29.832,I got a .44. I'm taking Papi.
00:53:29.832,00:53:31.667,You want them?
00:53:31.667,00:53:33.627,I see the wheels turning.
00:53:33.627,00:53:35.754,"You're thinking, mm, a blindfold, use your teeth."
00:53:35.754,00:53:38.757,That's not what I'm thinking.
00:53:38.757,00:53:40.926,"Oh! Shit, man."
00:53:40.926,00:53:42.594,That was uncalled for.
00:53:42.594,00:53:44.680,I liked you better when you were I-know-a-guy Bobby.
00:53:44.680,00:53:46.390,That Bobby was a good guy.
00:53:46.390,00:53:50.061,"Liked you better when you were winking at waitresses, shooting the heads off chickens."
00:53:50.061,00:53:52.563,Give me the keys.
00:53:52.563,00:53:54.230,Shit!
00:53:54.230,00:53:55.691,PAPI: What's going on?
00:53:55.691,00:53:57.818,You saw that coming?
00:53:57.818,00:53:59.403,"Damn, you're good."
00:53:59.403,00:54:01.405,"Now, one of us is gonna have to pick up those keys."
00:54:01.405,00:54:02.781,Guess.
00:54:02.781,00:54:04.783,All right.
00:54:04.783,00:54:06.911,"Get them, get them."
00:54:34.146,00:54:35.480,"Hey, pull over!"
00:54:35.480,00:54:38.025,"Pull over? Hey, Papi, you like my driving?"
00:54:45.783,00:54:47.283,"Oh, shit!"
00:54:51.080,00:54:53.540,"Come on, Bobby, I ain't got all damn day!"
00:55:40.838,00:55:42.131,What do you wanna do?
00:56:00.983,00:56:02.318,Ow!
00:56:17.373,00:56:19.918,All right. All right.
00:56:19.918,00:56:22.338,You let me go first.
00:56:22.338,00:56:24.006,On three.
00:56:24.006,00:56:26.842,One. Two. Three.
00:56:26.842,00:56:29.385,See? Now you're making me not be able to trust you.
00:56:29.385,00:56:31.013,"Count of three, let each other go."
00:56:31.013,00:56:32.348,That's fair.
00:56:32.348,00:56:35.600,One. Two.
00:56:35.600,00:56:36.935,I knew it.
00:56:36.935,00:56:38.394,No.
00:56:38.394,00:56:39.688,I'm gonna let you go.
00:56:39.688,00:56:41.232,One...
00:56:44.693,00:56:48.322,Ha-ha-ha.
00:56:48.322,00:56:52.284,"Come on, man. You gotta admit, that was kind of fun, no?"
00:56:52.284,00:56:53.952,You didn't like that?
00:56:53.952,00:56:57.039,Who are you? Huh?
00:56:58.832,00:57:00.834,U.S. Navy Intel.
00:57:00.834,00:57:02.211,Or I was.
00:57:02.211,00:57:04.420,My commander FUBARed my jacket.
00:57:04.420,00:57:06.715,Now I'm AWOL after stabbing an MP.
00:57:06.715,00:57:10.468,You're lucky. They got me framed for killing my boss.
00:57:10.468,00:57:12.930,Did your boss order your four closest friends to kill you?
00:57:14.181,00:57:16.183,"No, you got me there."
00:57:16.183,00:57:17.976,Petty Officer Michael Stigman.
00:57:20.229,00:57:22.898,"DEA Officer Bobby Trench, but I guess you know that already."
00:57:22.898,00:57:24.316,Pleasure.
00:57:24.316,00:57:28.737,"So, what, you just happened to pick me, or you got orders to set me up on purpose?"
00:57:28.737,00:57:31.198,"I had orders, man."
00:57:31.198,00:57:33.325,My people did. There's not much they don't know.
00:57:33.325,00:57:35.577,Your people?
00:57:33.325,00:57:37.579,I'm trying to piece together the truth so I can take it to the admiral.
00:57:37.579,00:57:40.791,That's why they wanna kill me and why I wanted to talk to Papi.
00:57:40.791,00:57:42.709,Right.
00:57:42.709,00:57:44.669,Well...
00:57:44.669,00:57:48.548,I guess we can both talk to him at the same time.
00:57:48.548,00:57:49.758,Like we're working together?
00:57:49.758,00:57:51.260,Not like we're working together.
00:57:51.260,00:57:53.929,"No, like we're working in the same vicinity."
00:57:53.929,00:57:56.014,Together.
00:57:56.014,00:57:57.682,Together.
00:57:57.682,00:57:59.768,And don't get all We are the world on me either.
00:57:59.768,00:58:02.562,"When this is over, I'm still gonna shoot you."
00:58:02.562,00:58:04.231,"Come on, man, ebony and ivory."
00:58:04.231,00:58:06.524,"Shit, I think he puked."
00:58:07.651,00:58:09.527,"Oh, yeah, he puked."
00:58:09.527,00:58:11.029,Hey.
00:58:12.489,00:58:15.117,"Ah, I'm gonna fucking kill you both."
00:58:15.117,00:58:16.368,This might take a while.
00:58:16.368,00:58:18.245,"STIG: I got all day, partner. Hold on."
00:58:19.704,00:58:21.332,Let me put that in there with you. Put that on you.
00:58:26.170,00:58:30.090,"So, partner, how you wanna do this?"
00:58:30.090,00:58:32.134,"I like that, it's got a nice roll off your tongue."
00:58:32.134,00:58:34.052,We're not that close.
00:58:34.052,00:58:36.138,Don't kumbaya.
00:58:34.052,00:58:38.390,I'm gonna get my bucket and towel and waterboard his ass.
00:58:38.390,00:58:41.018,We gotta give him a chance to talk. You got anything to say?
00:58:41.018,00:58:47.691,"I hope you guys like the taste of balls because I'm gonna chop yours off, stuff them in your mouths."
00:58:47.691,00:58:51.487,Or maybe I'll put yours in his and his in yours.
00:58:51.487,00:58:53.530,Want me to get the bucket?
00:58:55.615,00:58:59.786,So why were you putting so much money in Tres Cruces?
00:58:59.786,00:59:01.413,It's Tres Cruces.
00:59:01.413,00:59:07.336,"We thought you just stashed a little cash there until we robbed the place, found 40 million. Why is that?"
00:59:07.336,00:59:08.837,You robbed Tres Cruces.
00:59:08.837,00:59:10.381,That's correct.
00:59:13.717,00:59:15.844,"That's funny, huh?"
00:59:15.844,00:59:17.304,"Yeah, that is funny, isn't it?"
00:59:17.304,00:59:20.098,You're both dead.
00:59:20.098,00:59:23.394,And I didn't even have to kill you.
00:59:23.394,00:59:26.397,I thought you were sharp.
00:59:26.397,00:59:27.731,But you...
00:59:27.731,00:59:30.275,You just ripped off the CIA.

00:59:42.954,00:59:48.085,The only money I deliver to Tres Cruces is a payment.
00:59:48.085,00:59:52.630,PAPI: The CIA. They take 7 percent of my revenue.
00:59:52.630,00:59:57.469,"In return, they let me use their planes so I can get my shit across the border."
00:59:59.096,01:00:02.682,"I could do it a lot cheaper, but there was really no negotiations."
01:00:02.682,01:00:07.521,"You know, they take it from all the cartels."

01:01:51.124,01:01:53.043,What are you smirking at?
01:01:54.794,01:01:58.549,"You know, I've been racking my brain trying to figure out who you look like."

01:13:33.243,01:13:35.203,"For a car thief, you are particular."
01:13:35.203,01:13:36.662,I'll break into the Honda.
01:13:36.662,01:13:37.955,I look like I'm gonna ride in a Honda?
01:13:37.955,01:13:39.207,You could.
01:13:39.207,01:13:41.042,You could pick something with class.

01:13:43.753,01:13:46.422,It ain't no Les Miserables for you tonight.

01:13:49.092,01:13:53.429,"Look, it's not my fault Quince took the money back to the base."
01:13:53.429,01:13:55.014,You said you took the money back.
01:13:55.014,01:13:56.640,"No, I never said that."
01:13:56.640,01:13:58.268,So the money could be anywhere.
01:13:58.268,01:14:02.980,"It could be in East Jabip, the Cayman Islands-- The money is on the base."
01:14:00.103,01:14:04.941,"I gave it to Commander Quince, and he told the guys to take it back to the base."
01:14:04.941,01:14:07.235,Right before he tried to kill you.
01:14:07.235,01:14:09.653,That doesn't mean he's lying about the base.
01:14:09.653,01:14:12.782,"Not everybody's as paranoid as you, Bobby. Jeez."
01:14:12.782,01:14:15.618,What about the Prius?

01:14:29.340,01:14:31.301,Holy shit.
01:14:32.843,01:14:34.220,"Yeah, just pick a car."
01:14:34.220,01:14:36.055,Right here.
01:14:36.055,01:14:37.556,You picked that one?
01:14:37.556,01:14:39.558,Yeah.
01:14:39.558,01:14:41.518,"Fuck you want, a fucking Bentley?"
01:14:41.518,01:14:43.313,I got it.
01:14:58.619,01:15:00.830,WOMAN: Hi.
01:15:00.830,01:15:02.748,Hey.
01:15:02.748,01:15:06.919,Crazy question: You wouldn't have anybody knows how to fix a snowmobile?
01:15:06.919,01:15:08.629,I don't think so.
01:15:08.629,01:15:10.756,Would you check for me? I really need it fixed by tonight.
01:15:10.756,01:15:12.549,"Why, a big storm coming?"
01:15:12.549,01:15:14.844,You never can be too sure.
01:15:14.844,01:15:16.929,I'll be right back.
01:15:18.306,01:15:20.099,Up with that?
01:15:20.099,01:15:22.226,"She smiled at you, you didn't wink at her?"
01:15:22.226,01:15:24.270,I don't wink at every woman I see.
01:15:24.270,01:15:26.147,"Snowmobile in Texas, huh?"
01:15:26.147,01:15:28.149,"You must be in some serious shit, sailor."
01:15:28.149,01:15:29.442,"You got yourself a new claw, huh?"
01:15:29.442,01:15:31.110,Give me claw.
01:15:31.110,01:15:33.696,It's a beaut. You still got my rainy-day stash?
01:15:33.696,01:15:35.198,Yeah.
01:15:38.868,01:15:40.411,"See you later, Stig."
01:15:40.411,01:15:41.912,All right.
01:15:44.415,01:15:47.835,"STIG: You know what they say, talk softly and carry an M-4 with a grenade launcher."
01:15:47.835,01:15:50.380,BOBBY: Wow.
01:15:50.380,01:15:52.048,Which one you want?
01:15:52.048,01:15:55.385,This one. What's your plan for getting on the base?
01:15:55.385,01:15:56.635,I'm working on it.
01:16:11.067,01:16:14.778,"Once we get to the command building, Quince's office is first floor."
01:16:14.778,01:16:16.822,"If he's not in the field, that's where he lives 18 hours a day."
01:16:16.822,01:16:20.076,You still haven't told me what the plan is to get through the gate.
01:16:20.076,01:16:22.786,I'm capable of coming up with a plan.
01:16:22.786,01:16:25.331,I'm not saying you're not.
01:16:25.331,01:16:28.084,I'm working on it.
01:16:28.084,01:16:29.544,Better work faster.
01:16:35.550,01:16:36.884,Much faster.
01:16:38.469,01:16:41.931,GUARD 1: Move it up. Quickly.
01:16:41.931,01:16:45.684,GUARD 1: Halt! He's going through!
01:16:45.684,01:16:47.437,That fast enough for you?
01:16:50.689,01:16:53.692,Shit!
01:16:53.692,01:16:55.736,GUARD 1: Let's go! Let's go!
01:16:55.736,01:16:57.280,GUARD 3: Move it!
01:17:04.370,01:17:06.663,That was your plan?
01:17:06.663,01:17:09.584,Nobody in their right mind breaks into a naval base.
01:17:09.584,01:17:11.461,That's why it's a brilliant plan.
01:17:11.461,01:17:14.171,You should've seen your face.
01:17:14.171,01:17:15.590,Your stop coming up.
01:17:15.590,01:17:17.674,"I'll play decoy, try to get to the admiral."
01:17:17.674,01:17:20.428,"Things go wrong, I'll see you back at the boat yard."
01:17:20.428,01:17:22.679,Things ain't going wrong.
01:17:22.679,01:17:25.182,"I get to the admiral, I'm getting a medal. Watch."
01:17:26.850,01:17:28.603,You're gonna wish me luck?
01:17:28.603,01:17:29.979,Good luck.
01:17:29.979,01:17:32.273,Quince's office at the end of the hall.
01:17:32.273,01:17:34.942,"Remember, first floor, end of the hall!"
01:17:44.619,01:17:47.871,GUARD 1: Halt! Stop where you are!
01:17:47.871,01:17:49.332,We have a breach at Status Hall!
01:17:49.332,01:17:50.833,"GUARD 2: Go, go, go!"
01:17:51.959,01:17:53.794,Up the stairs!
01:17:55.338,01:17:59.675,"Sir, Petty Officer Michael Stigman, ID number 540333."
01:17:59.675,01:18:02.261,"Wait, what's the problem?"
01:18:02.261,01:18:04.972,"I didn't mean to do that to you, man. Sir."
01:18:04.972,01:18:06.849,I've been in service 12 years.
01:18:06.849,01:18:08.934,I've never stepped foot in an officers' mess.
01:18:08.934,01:18:11.228,"Please, sir, it's an emergency."
01:18:11.228,01:18:13.439,"Stand outside, please."
01:18:14.773,01:18:16.900,Leave us alone.
01:18:16.900,01:18:18.569,"Hey, I'm really sorry about that."
01:18:18.569,01:18:20.279,I didn't mean to hit you like that.
01:18:20.279,01:18:23.115,"I'm listening, sailor. Sit."
01:18:23.115,01:18:24.700,"Thank you, sir."
01:18:29.205,01:18:31.290,QUINCE: Try the admiral again.
01:18:47.806,01:18:52.395,ADMIRAL: And you believed this stolen money would be used to fight drug cartels?
01:18:52.395,01:18:55.231,I thought the orders came down the valid chain of command.
01:18:55.231,01:18:57.358,Blind loyalty is not loyalty.
01:18:57.358,01:18:59.109,"I know that, sir."
01:18:59.109,01:19:02.946,You've shown a lot of tenacity and a lot of guts bringing this to me.
01:19:02.946,01:19:05.408,"Thank you, sir. That means the world coming from you."
01:19:05.408,01:19:10.037,"Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do for you."
01:19:10.037,01:19:12.248,Of course.
01:19:12.248,01:19:13.708,You can arrest Commander Quince.
01:19:13.708,01:19:16.752,The United States Navy does not rob banks.
01:19:16.752,01:19:18.962,Its personnel did not rob a bank.
01:19:18.962,01:19:22.758,I'm not gonna tarnish the integrity of the Navy over one crooked sailor.
01:19:22.758,01:19:30.266,"If there was money taken from the bank that was part of an illegal CIA slush fund, the Navy had no knowledge the fund existed."
01:19:32.351,01:19:34.604,Your jacket has you six months AWOL?
01:19:34.604,01:19:37.607,"Yes, sir."
01:19:39.734,01:19:46.657,"Commander Quince's jacket will likewise be amended so he's also AWOL, making none of this the Navy's problem."
01:19:46.657,01:19:48.701,"Sir, this isn't right."
01:19:48.701,01:19:54.373,"Well, I'd offer more, but when the hand has gangrene, you chop it off to save the body."
01:19:54.373,01:19:59.002,You don't keep the pinkie around just because it meant well.
01:20:07.470,01:20:12.558,Have Petty Officer Stigman dropped outside the main gate.
01:20:12.558,01:20:15.519,He sets foot on a military base anywhere in the world...
01:20:16.520,01:20:17.980,I want him shot.
01:20:17.980,01:20:20.232,This is bullshit.
01:20:17.980,01:20:22.526,Men like me fight and die on the orders of men like you!
01:20:22.526,01:20:24.654,"Without us, those stars on your shoulder are a fucking costume!"
01:20:43.213,01:20:44.465,Open the safe.
01:20:44.465,01:20:45.966,Your boss know you're doing this?
01:20:45.966,01:20:47.384,Open it.
01:20:47.384,01:20:49.219,Or did the CIA kill her like they did Jessup?
01:20:49.219,01:20:52.640,What's it to you?
01:20:52.640,01:20:56.059,"Neither do I, Harvey."
01:20:58.813,01:21:00.022,Huh?
01:21:00.022,01:21:02.566,"Well, my mother named me Harold."
01:21:02.566,01:21:05.486,I like Harvey.
01:21:05.486,01:21:07.321,Don't you like Harvey?
01:21:07.321,01:21:09.657,"I don't know what you're talk-- Yes, you do."
01:21:09.657,01:21:13.577,Been to the Camino Real Hotel lately? Open the safe.
01:21:20.209,01:21:21.585,GUARD 1: Staging area cleared up!
01:21:21.585,01:21:23.003,GUARD 2: Bring it through!
01:21:36.016,01:21:39.311,Where's the money?
01:21:39.311,01:21:42.189,She's getting her nails done.
01:21:42.189,01:21:43.858,I don't know.
01:21:45.526,01:21:48.195,"All right, tell me what you do know."
01:21:48.195,01:21:52.616,Your girl found out where the CIA was stashing the money right about when I did.
01:21:52.616,01:21:58.330,"When I told her that we could get away with the money by setting you and Stigman up, she didn't even blink."
01:21:58.330,01:22:00.040,Don't lie to me.
01:22:00.040,01:22:02.501,"Was she that unhappy, Bobby?"
01:22:07.256,01:22:10.259,Where is the money?
01:22:10.259,01:22:13.262,You think I'd keep it here with you and Stigman still alive?
01:22:13.262,01:22:15.347,"Come on, Bobby."
01:22:15.347,01:22:17.850,"You gave it to her, didn't you?"
01:22:20.102,01:22:21.937,Didn't you?
01:22:21.937,01:22:24.189,Commander.
01:22:27.735,01:22:29.486,"MAN 1: Go, go, go, go!"
01:22:29.486,01:22:31.196,"MAN 3: Move, move, move!"
01:22:36.619,01:22:39.329,All personnel evacuate the building.
01:22:39.329,01:22:43.250,All personnel evacuate the building.
01:22:46.002,01:22:47.504,"MAN 5: Take the back, in that alley!"
01:22:47.504,01:22:49.005,MAN 6: Go to the front! Let's go!
01:22:51.508,01:22:53.594,"MAN 7: This way! Come on, let's move!"
01:22:53.594,01:22:55.554,"Come on, come on! Find him!"
01:23:40.056,01:23:42.017,MAN 1: Clear!
01:23:42.017,01:23:43.352,MAN 2: Clear!
01:24:13.048,01:24:16.468,You okay?
01:24:41.159,01:24:43.704,"You okay, sir?"
01:24:54.256,01:24:57.175,MAN: Work off the standpipe!
01:24:58.260,01:25:01.263,This is really good barbecue.
01:25:01.263,01:25:04.391,You don't want to regret not trying it.
01:25:04.391,01:25:07.728,Why don't you stop wasting my time and just kill me?
01:25:07.728,01:25:12.816,"Even if Bobby was coming with the money, you'd still kill us both."
01:25:17.029,01:25:18.405,But he's not coming.
01:25:18.405,01:25:19.907,He'll be here.
01:25:19.907,01:25:23.118,No. He won't.
01:25:23.118,01:25:26.121,You think he's just gonna let you die?
01:25:26.121,01:25:31.877,You think it was a coincidence the Navy came looking for Bobby at my house?
01:25:31.877,01:25:36.090,"If I couldn't have Bobby, at least I'd have half of 43 million."
01:25:38.884,01:25:41.470,You set up Bobby Beans.
01:25:41.470,01:25:43.806,I wouldn't be coming for you either.
01:25:43.806,01:25:45.390,Where's the money?
01:25:45.390,01:25:47.726,Come on. I don't know.
01:25:47.726,01:25:49.352,"Gone, out of the country."
01:25:49.352,01:25:52.022,"It's certainly not on a Navy base, Papi."
01:25:52.022,01:25:54.441,Where does that leave you?
01:25:55.525,01:25:58.403,Exactly where I deserve to be.
01:26:05.035,01:26:07.537,Yeah.
01:26:08.747,01:26:10.332,You're late.
01:26:10.332,01:26:11.708,I got the money.
01:26:11.708,01:26:14.795,I don't believe you.
01:26:14.795,01:26:18.007,"Believe me, I got it."
01:26:18.007,01:26:20.050,Where are you?
01:26:20.050,01:26:21.551,"Hi, Bobby."
01:26:21.551,01:26:23.137,Debbie?
01:26:25.681,01:26:26.849,Can he hear us?
01:26:26.849,01:26:29.059,Just hang up the phone and run.
01:26:29.059,01:26:30.686,"Okay, listen to me."
01:26:30.686,01:26:33.772,Tell him I got the money.
01:26:33.772,01:26:35.357,Hang up the phone.
01:26:37.693,01:26:41.237,It's not your fault.
01:26:37.693,01:26:44.240,"Just-- Debbie, tell him I have the money."
01:26:44.240,01:26:47.536,And I know you know where the money is.
01:26:47.536,01:26:50.080,Just tell him I have it.
01:26:51.206,01:26:54.209,"Debbie, listen to me."
01:26:54.209,01:26:56.170,I'm sorry.
01:26:57.629,01:26:59.756,I really meant to love you.
01:26:59.756,01:27:01.257,Debbie.
01:27:04.178,01:27:07.514,Where are you?
01:27:09.850,01:27:12.144,Where are you? Debbie?
01:27:12.144,01:27:15.105,Hello? Hello?
01:27:22.237,01:27:23.780,Hello?
01:27:26.116,01:27:29.244,Hello? Ahem. Debbie? Uh...
01:27:32.956,01:27:35.709,"Wait a minute, I got the money."
01:27:51.016,01:27:52.851,What'd they say?
01:27:52.851,01:27:55.645,Admiral washed his hands of the whole thing.
01:27:55.645,01:27:58.314,Navy turned their back.
01:27:59.691,01:28:02.194,"There was no money, Stig."
01:28:02.194,01:28:03.779,What?
01:28:03.779,01:28:05.614,Of course there is.
01:28:05.614,01:28:08.200,"And Quince gave it to Deb, and Deb is dead."
01:28:10.368,01:28:11.954,Papi killed her.
01:28:15.498,01:28:17.209,Fuck him.
01:28:17.209,01:28:19.628,Let's go down to Mexico.
01:28:17.209,01:28:21.588,"We'll lure them all down, then take every one of them out."
01:28:21.588,01:28:23.423,And then what?
01:28:23.423,01:28:25.884,Quince and Papi would be dead.
01:28:25.884,01:28:27.970,And then what?
01:28:27.970,01:28:29.638,"You don't get it, do you?"
01:28:29.638,01:28:32.224,"God bless you, you still think there's some kind of code."
01:28:32.224,01:28:33.725,There is no code.
01:28:33.725,01:28:37.813,"You followed every order the Navy gave, they kicked you in the teeth."
01:28:37.813,01:28:40.899,"No one fights for the Navy, okay? It's not about the Navy."
01:28:40.899,01:28:43.068,You fight for the guy that's fighting next to you.
01:28:43.068,01:28:45.154,That doesn't mean anything to you?
01:28:45.154,01:28:47.948,Heh.
01:28:47.948,01:28:52.494,"Oh, and just so you know, my code, my code saved your life."
01:28:52.494,01:28:54.412,Three inches between your heart and shoulder.
01:28:54.412,01:28:56.165,"My bullet goes three inches left, you'd be dead."
01:28:56.165,01:28:57.707,I wouldn't be here.
01:28:57.707,01:29:00.002,Quince decided to kill me because I let you live.
01:29:00.002,01:29:02.754,"Oh, what, you think I missed? Huh?"
01:29:02.754,01:29:05.632,Is that what you think?
01:29:05.632,01:29:08.051,When have you ever seen me miss?
01:29:09.845,01:29:12.722,You stay here.
01:31:16.972,01:31:19.308,Our deal still stand?
01:31:19.308,01:31:22.185,"I give you the money, I walk away clean?"
01:31:34.948,01:31:36.450,Looks like you had a banner morning.
01:31:36.450,01:31:38.368,PAPI: You better have my money.
01:31:38.368,01:31:40.036,Right here. Every penny.
01:31:40.036,01:31:41.788,Where's Bobby?
01:31:41.788,01:31:43.873,We had a philosophical falling-out.
01:31:43.873,01:31:45.667,Open your trunk.
01:31:45.667,01:31:50.213,"I want your word that you and your boys, Julio, all of them, you'll help me kill Commander Quince."
01:31:50.213,01:31:51.881,Who's Commander Quince?
01:31:53.800,01:31:55.135,That's him.
01:32:02.351,01:32:06.604,"Mr. Stigman, you promised me $43 million for killing everyone on this ranch."
01:32:06.604,01:32:08.064,"Got the money right here, sir."
01:32:08.064,01:32:09.816,I promised Papi the 43 million too.
01:32:09.816,01:32:11.609,You two are gonna have to duke it out.
01:32:11.609,01:32:15.405,Maybe he and I'll just kill you instead and split the money.
01:32:15.405,01:32:18.116,Fifty percent of 40 million?
01:32:18.116,01:32:19.993,"Better than 100 percent dead, right?"
01:32:19.993,01:32:21.786,He'll double-cross you.
01:32:19.993,01:32:23.121,"Minute your back is turned, bullet in the head."
01:32:25.165,01:32:26.666,Fifty-fifty.
01:32:26.666,01:32:28.668,The guy up on the roof says 60-40.
01:32:28.668,01:32:30.837,He ain't got a trustworthy bone in his body.
01:32:30.837,01:32:32.881,"I came back, didn't I?"
01:33:03.036,01:33:05.121,Fucking CIA.
01:33:06.498,01:33:08.542,"Red rover, red rover."
01:33:08.542,01:33:13.671,Whoever's got my 43.125 million better come the fuck on out.
01:33:13.671,01:33:15.215,You offer him the money too?
01:33:15.215,01:33:17.884,I didn't call him.
01:33:17.884,01:33:19.511,Why the fuck did you tell him that?
01:33:20.762,01:33:22.222,"EARL: Thank you, commander."
01:33:22.222,01:33:25.434,"Mr. Stigman, come on out and open the trunk."
01:33:25.434,01:33:27.185,"Nice and slow, now."
01:33:38.238,01:33:40.490,"EARL: Well, what do we got here?"
01:33:40.490,01:33:42.451,Sounds like a Mexican wedding.
01:34:04.473,01:34:06.640,Is that my '64 Impala?
01:34:06.640,01:34:09.436,That's correct.
01:34:09.436,01:34:11.354,I told you.
01:34:11.354,01:34:13.398,I know a guy.
01:34:14.483,01:34:17.402,"Now, who wants to see $43 million?"
01:34:20.238,01:34:22.991,"For a minute there, I thought you had me chasing my tail."
01:34:24.493,01:34:26.119,You want to count it?
01:34:26.119,01:34:28.662,"If you're shorting me, I know where to find you."
01:34:28.662,01:34:30.123,So we're good?
01:34:30.123,01:34:32.292,Did I not give you my word?
01:34:32.292,01:34:34.336,Then don't treat me like an asshole.
01:34:34.336,01:34:35.753,I'll try my best.
01:34:38.756,01:34:41.635,You and Mr. Stigman are free to go.
01:34:41.635,01:34:43.219,"BOBBY: Yes, sir."
01:34:43.219,01:34:45.096,EARL: I trust you can find your way home.
01:34:45.096,01:34:46.889,That's right. Let's go.
01:34:46.889,01:34:48.682,STIG: I'm not gonna let him get away with the money.
01:34:48.682,01:34:50.602,I hate these teeth.
01:34:50.602,01:34:51.978,I got a plan.
01:34:51.978,01:34:55.482,"I got my grenade launcher, I got my M-4."
01:34:55.482,01:34:57.609,I'm capable of coming up with a plan.
01:34:57.609,01:34:58.985,It better be a goddamn good one.
01:34:58.985,01:35:01.530,It's a good plan.
01:35:33.645,01:35:35.647,That was your plan?
01:35:35.647,01:35:37.315,"Yeah, that's why it's a brilliant plan."
01:35:37.315,01:35:38.858,Nobody expected it.
01:35:40.485,01:35:41.986,Go.
01:36:13.351,01:36:15.019,"QUINCE: Come on, move it!"
01:36:16.896,01:36:19.107,"Move, you dumb assholes!"
01:36:32.287,01:36:33.622,You coming?
01:36:41.129,01:36:42.838,"Go ahead, I'll be right behind you."
01:36:42.838,01:36:45.508,Don't miss.
01:36:50.846,01:36:53.057,Told you.
01:37:22.211,01:37:24.005,BOBBY: Stig.
01:37:24.005,01:37:26.090,Stig!
01:37:30.762,01:37:33.682,Don't do it. Don't do it.
01:37:35.016,01:37:37.018,No more fucking around.
01:37:37.018,01:37:40.146,"Now, drop your weapon."
01:37:40.146,01:37:42.148,Tell Mr. Stigman to do the same.
01:37:42.148,01:37:44.734,BOBBY: You tell him.
01:37:44.734,01:37:46.820,EARL: It's real simple.
01:37:46.820,01:37:49.531,We can all make a deal or we can all die.
01:37:49.531,01:37:50.990,I'm not making any deals.
01:37:50.990,01:37:52.908,"EARL: Talk to your man, Bobby."
01:37:52.908,01:37:54.494,Be the smart one.
01:37:54.494,01:37:57.121,You think Tres Cruces is the only stash we got?
01:37:57.121,01:38:00.750,We got 20 more.
01:38:00.750,01:38:02.627,You're not gonna change a damn thing.
01:38:02.627,01:38:05.547,Stig?
01:38:05.547,01:38:07.881,"You're my people, right?"
01:38:09.883,01:38:11.594,That's correct.
01:38:11.594,01:38:13.638,Unh! Aah!
01:38:24.315,01:38:25.567,You good?
01:38:25.567,01:38:28.110,Never better.
01:38:28.110,01:38:29.821,"We're not people, though."
01:38:29.821,01:38:31.280,This makes us family.
01:38:31.280,01:38:33.700,"All right, brother."
01:38:33.700,01:38:37.953,"STIG: Hey, Se√±or Einstein, you're looking kind of fucked up sitting there, man."

01:38:42.542,01:38:45.169,Mow my lawn.
01:38:56.848,01:38:58.474,"STIG: Well, you know what was so cool?"
01:38:58.474,01:39:00.351,You rolling in on that '64 Impala.
01:39:00.351,01:39:01.728,"I mean, you looked badass, man."
01:39:01.728,01:39:03.354,"BOBBY: Oh, yeah, that's right."

01:39:12.572,01:39:14.156,Thank you.
01:39:12.572,01:39:15.825,You're doing this after everything we've been through?
01:39:15.825,01:39:17.619,Arm or leg?
01:39:17.619,01:39:19.495,This is not gonna make you feel better.
01:39:19.495,01:39:22.081,"Leg, there's more flesh, there's not as much bone."
01:39:22.081,01:39:25.126,The arm will-- Know what you are?
01:39:23.291,01:39:27.712,"You're a petty-- Oh, fucking son of a bitch!"
01:39:27.712,01:39:29.631,"Hurts, doesn't it?"
01:39:29.631,01:39:34.051,"Three more inches to the left, you wouldn't be winking at waitresses."
01:39:34.051,01:39:36.387,"I'd still wink, I just wouldn't be able to do anything."
01:39:36.387,01:39:38.556,I don't miss.
01:39:38.556,01:39:40.057,When's the last time you saw me miss?
01:39:40.057,01:39:42.685,You gonna carry my ass all the way the fuck home.
01:39:42.685,01:39:44.270,"Oh, shit, man. This burns."
01:39:44.270,01:39:46.856,BOBBY: Ha-ha-ha. That's correct.
01:39:46.856,01:39:50.318,"You know, I shot you when I didn't know who you were."
01:39:50.318,01:39:52.236,Before we were family.
01:39:52.236,01:39:53.571,BOBBY: We're family now.
01:39:53.571,01:39:55.030,I shot you because I know who you are.
01:39:55.030,01:39:57.158,STIG: That ain't right.
01:40:14.550,01:40:16.427,They definitely got the look.
01:40:16.427,01:40:20.849,"Assholes in windshield sunglasses, practically CIA uniform."
01:40:20.849,01:40:22.517,Can I get you boys anything else?
01:40:23.559,01:40:25.603,Are your doughnuts any good?
01:40:25.603,01:40:28.147,"Tell you the truth, they're pretty lousy."
01:40:28.147,01:40:30.608,Can't tell you how happy we are to hear that.
01:40:32.485,01:40:34.946,You take care.
01:40:34.946,01:40:36.531,Saw what?
01:40:36.531,01:40:38.282,That's a twitch.
01:40:43.287,01:40:47.166,"For a guy who just blew up $43 million, all of a sudden you're a generous tipper."
01:40:47.166,01:40:49.794,Who said I blew up $43 million?
01:40:51.546,01:40:53.673,What are you saying?
01:40:53.673,01:40:55.842,I'm hearing something.
01:40:55.842,01:40:59.428,"If you're hearing it, it's because you're hearing it, not because I'm saying it."
01:41:00.429,01:41:02.807,How much did you keep?
01:41:02.807,01:41:05.018,Two million?
01:41:05.018,01:41:06.853,That's like one each.
01:41:06.853,01:41:08.103,"Oh, so now you get half?"
01:41:08.103,01:41:10.398,"Well, I shot half the guys."
01:41:11.482,01:41:12.901,Two million?
01:42:23.220,01:44:03.029,"Na, na, na, na, na Na, na, na, na, na Na, na, na, na, na Na, na, na, na, na Na, na, na, na, na."
