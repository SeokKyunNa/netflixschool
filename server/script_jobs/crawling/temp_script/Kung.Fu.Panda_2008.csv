00:00:37.955,00:00:41.583,were the stuff of legend.
00:00:41.625,00:00:47.548,He traveled the land in search of worthy foes.
00:00:57.265,00:01:02.312,I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew on my fist!
00:01:02.354,00:01:06.400,"The warrior said nothing, for his mouth was full."
00:01:06.441,00:01:09.945,Then he swallowed.
00:01:09.987,00:01:12.155,Enough talk.
00:01:12.197,00:01:13.824,Shashabooey!
00:01:16.577,00:01:22.082,"He was so deadly, in fact, that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness."
00:01:22.123,00:01:24.626,- My eyes!
00:01:24.668,00:01:27.379,- And attractive.
00:01:27.421,00:01:30.465,There is no charge for awesomeness.
00:01:30.507,00:01:33.218,- Or attractiveness.
00:01:33.260,00:01:35.054,Kablooey!
00:01:35.094,00:01:37.138,how many foes he faced.
00:01:37.180,00:01:40.517,They were no match for his bodacity!
00:01:49.359,00:01:50.778,Yah!
00:01:52.738,00:01:57.910,Never before had a panda been so feared! And so loved.
00:01:57.952,00:02:06.501,"Even the most heroic heroes in all of China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master."
00:02:06.543,00:02:09.588,- We should hang out.
00:02:12.215,00:02:14.676,would have to wait.
00:02:14.718,00:02:22.142,"Because when you're facing the 10,000 demons of Demon Mountain, there's only one thing that matters and that's..."
00:02:22.183,00:02:23.852,Po! Get up!
00:02:23.894,00:02:25.646,You'll be late for work!
00:02:25.687,00:02:27.522,What?
00:02:33.403,00:02:35.864,Po! Get up!
00:02:50.963,00:02:54.091,you doing up there?
00:02:54.133,00:02:55.759,Uh... nothing.
00:02:59.304,00:03:03.017,Monkey! Mantis!
00:03:04.351,00:03:06.478,Uh...
00:03:09.648,00:03:12.943,You're late for work.
00:03:12.985,00:03:14.486,Coming!
00:03:24.412,00:03:28.834,"- Sorry, Dad."
00:03:28.876,00:03:31.210,What were you doing up there?
00:03:31.252,00:03:33.714,Oh. Nothing.
00:03:33.755,00:03:35.090,- About what?
00:03:35.132,00:03:36.717,What were you dreaming about?
00:03:36.758,00:03:39.178,What was I...? Uh...
00:03:39.219,00:03:41.346,I was dreaming about...
00:03:41.805,00:03:42.973,...uh...
00:03:43.015,00:03:45.809,- ...noodles.
00:03:45.851,00:03:48.187,You were really dreaming about noodles?
00:03:48.228,00:03:50.939,Uh... yeah. What else would I be dreaming about?
00:03:50.981,00:03:53.525,Oh! Careful!
00:03:53.567,00:03:59.322,"Oh, happy day! My son, finally having the noodle dream!"
00:03:59.364,00:04:04.369,You don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment.
00:04:04.411,00:04:08.082,"- This is a sign, Po."
00:04:08.123,00:04:15.296,You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
00:04:15.338,00:04:20.427,And then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant!
00:04:20.468,00:04:24.181,"Just as I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father..."
00:04:24.223,00:04:26.808,...who won it from a friend in mahjong.
00:04:26.850,00:04:31.730,"- Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream."
00:04:31.772,00:04:35.483,We are noodle folk.
00:04:35.525,00:04:39.487,"But, Dad, didn't you ever want to do something else?"
00:04:39.529,00:04:41.489,Something besides noodles?
00:04:41.531,00:04:48.622,"Actually, when I was young and crazy, I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu."
00:04:48.663,00:04:49.831,So why didn't you?
00:04:49.873,00:04:51.792,Because it was a stupid dream.
00:04:51.833,00:04:55.170,Can you imagine me making tofu?
00:04:58.423,00:05:01.843,No! We all have our place in this world.
00:05:01.885,00:05:04.471,"Mine is here, and yours is..."
00:05:04.512,00:05:05.847,"I know, is here."
00:05:05.889,00:05:11.103,"No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12 Service with a smile."
00:05:40.339,00:05:44.761,"Well done, students... if you were trying to disappoint me."
00:05:44.803,00:05:48.015,"Tigress, you need more ferocity!"
00:05:48.056,00:05:50.809,"Crane, height."
00:05:50.851,00:05:52.894,- Master Shifu. Aah!
00:05:52.936,00:05:55.480,It's Master Oogway.
00:06:06.283,00:06:09.828,"Master Oogway, you summoned me?"
00:06:16.043,00:06:20.421,Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?
00:06:20.463,00:06:22.674,"So, nothing's wrong?"
00:06:22.716,00:06:25.510,"Well, I didn't say that."
00:06:43.778,00:06:48.242,- You were saying?
00:06:48.283,00:06:51.203,Tai Lung will return.
00:06:55.374,00:06:58.585,That is impossible!
00:06:58.626,00:07:01.255,Nothing is impossible.
00:07:01.296,00:07:09.012,"Zeng! Fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons, double everything!"
00:07:09.054,00:07:11.056,Tai Lung does not leave that prison!
00:07:11.098,00:07:14.226,"Yes, Master Shifu!"
00:07:14.268,00:07:19.606,One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
00:07:19.647,00:07:23.526,We have to do something!
00:07:23.568,00:07:27.155,- He'll...
00:07:27.197,00:07:30.658,"When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see."
00:07:30.700,00:07:34.162,But if you allow it to settle...
00:07:34.204,00:07:37.040,...the answer becomes clear.
00:07:39.960,00:07:42.087,The Dragon Scroll.
00:07:42.754,00:07:44.423,It is time.
00:07:44.464,00:07:46.425,But who?
00:07:44.464,00:07:49.177,Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power?
00:07:49.219,00:07:53.890,To become the Dragon Warrior?
00:07:53.932,00:07:57.102,I don't know.
00:07:57.144,00:08:00.021,Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.
00:08:00.063,00:08:02.690,"- Hey, watch it, Po!"
00:08:02.732,00:08:04.067,- Oh!
00:08:04.109,00:08:06.778,Sorry. A thousand pardons.
00:08:06.820,00:08:09.864,- What?
00:08:09.906,00:08:13.410,Master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior! Today!
00:08:13.452,00:08:15.996,Everyone! Everyone! Go!
00:08:16.037,00:08:18.123,One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!
00:08:18.165,00:08:21.251,"We've been waiting 1,000 years for this! Just take the bowl!"
00:08:21.293,00:08:25.422,This is the greatest day in kung fu history! Just go!
00:08:25.464,00:08:28.300,Po! Where are you going?
00:08:28.342,00:08:30.635,To the Jade Palace.
00:08:30.677,00:08:33.096,But you're forgetting your noodle cart.
00:08:33.138,00:08:37.725,"The whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them."
00:08:37.767,00:08:39.353,Selling noodles?
00:08:42.022,00:08:44.065,"But, Dad, you know, I was kinda thinking, maybe I..."
00:08:44.107,00:08:46.609,- Yeah?
00:08:46.651,00:08:50.238,Uh-huh?
00:08:50.280,00:08:54.909,...could also sell the bean buns. They're about to go bad.
00:08:54.951,00:08:56.703,That's my boy!
00:08:56.744,00:08:58.997,I told you that dream was a sign.
00:08:59.039,00:09:02.209,Glad I had it.
00:09:06.213,00:09:08.465,- I'm a kung fu warrior!
00:09:08.507,00:09:11.385,- There's spots at the top.
00:09:45.626,00:09:48.505,Come on. Come on!
00:09:48.547,00:09:50.424,Almost there.
00:09:50.465,00:09:51.632,What?
00:09:51.674,00:09:54.553,"No! Oh, no!"
00:09:56.596,00:10:00.475,"- Sorry, Po."
00:10:04.645,00:10:08.400,No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.
00:10:13.447,00:10:16.699,It is an historic day.
00:10:16.741,00:10:21.662,"Yes, and one I feared I would not live to see."
00:10:21.704,00:10:23.706,Are your students ready?
00:10:23.748,00:10:25.666,"Yes, Master Oogway."
00:10:26.709,00:10:28.503,"Know this, old friend."
00:10:28.545,00:10:32.840,Whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the valley...
00:10:32.882,00:10:35.676,...but also to you.
00:10:39.097,00:10:44.685,- Let the tournament begin!
00:10:56.323,00:10:59.534,"- Oh, no, no, wait!"
00:10:59.576,00:11:03.413,"I'm coming! Wait, wait! Yes!"
00:11:06.207,00:11:08.793,Hey! Open the door!
00:11:10.462,00:11:13.672,Let me in!
00:11:13.714,00:11:20.096,"Citizens of the Valley of Peace, it is my great honor to present to you...Tigress!"
00:11:20.138,00:11:24.184,Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!
00:11:24.225,00:11:26.853,- The Furious Five!
00:11:38.490,00:11:39.824,"Yeah, the Furious Five!"
00:11:42.118,00:11:43.495,"Warriors, prepare!"
00:11:43.537,00:11:45.746,"Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole."
00:11:45.788,00:11:47.748,- Yeah.
00:11:49.584,00:11:53.046,The Thousand Tongues of Fire.
00:11:53.087,00:11:55.173,Whoa. Look at that.
00:11:55.215,00:11:57.091,Hey! Get out of the way!
00:11:57.133,00:12:00.719,Oh!
00:12:18.488,00:12:19.780,Oh...
00:12:30.083,00:12:33.878,Master Tigress!
00:12:35.129,00:12:39.634,"And believe me, citizens, you have not seen anything yet."
00:12:39.676,00:12:40.968,I know!
00:12:42.554,00:12:46.224,Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death.
00:12:58.278,00:13:03.074,I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.
00:13:08.037,00:13:15.920,"Citizens of the Valley of Peace, Master Oogway will now choose the Dragon Warrior!"
00:13:15.962,00:13:19.006,"Huh?! Oh, no! No, no, wait!"
00:13:20.049,00:13:21.760,Yeah.
00:13:38.151,00:13:41.279,Po! What are you doing?!
00:13:41.321,00:13:43.657,What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!
00:13:43.698,00:13:45.950,I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!
00:13:49.078,00:13:53.792,But I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream!
00:13:53.832,00:13:57.295,"I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad."
00:13:59.964,00:14:03.635,I love kung fu!
00:14:15.605,00:14:20.652,"Oh, come on, son."
00:14:25.281,00:14:27.826,Ahhh!
00:14:27.867,00:14:32.246,Oh! Come back!
00:14:42.089,00:14:43.717,Uh-oh.
00:14:54.394,00:14:58.648,What's going on?
00:14:58.690,00:15:00.941,"Where, uh...?"
00:15:03.110,00:15:05.029,What are you pointing...?
00:15:06.406,00:15:07.615,Oh!
00:15:07.657,00:15:09.492,OK. Sorry.
00:15:09.534,00:15:12.161,I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was.
00:15:12.203,00:15:14.163,How interesting.
00:15:14.205,00:15:17.458,"Master, are you pointing at me?"
00:15:17.500,00:15:21.504,- Him.
00:15:21.546,00:15:23.798,- You.
00:15:23.840,00:15:29.596,The universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior!
00:15:29.637,00:15:31.097,- What?
00:15:31.138,00:15:32.973,- What?!
00:15:42.734,00:15:45.278,"Stop, wait! Who told you to...?"
00:15:54.120,00:15:56.372,"Master Oogway, wait."
00:15:56.414,00:16:00.627,That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to our problem.
00:16:00.668,00:16:04.464,"You were about to point at Tigress, and that thing fell in front of her!"
00:16:04.505,00:16:05.965,That was just an accident!
00:16:06.006,00:16:09.343,There are no accidents.
00:16:23.733,00:16:26.653,"Forgive us, Master."
00:16:26.694,00:16:32.617,No. If the panda has not quit by morning then I will have failed you.
00:16:50.760,00:16:53.513,"Wait! Wait, wait, wait!"
00:16:53.554,00:16:55.974,...from Master Shifu.
00:17:00.520,00:17:02.981,What?! Double the guard?!
00:17:03.063,00:17:04.941,Extra precautions?!
00:17:04.983,00:17:07.443,Your prison may not be adequate?!
00:17:10.530,00:17:13.950,You doubt my prison security?!
00:17:13.992,00:17:15.869,Absolutely not.
00:17:15.910,00:17:18.955,Shifu does.
00:17:18.997,00:17:23.334,I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu.
00:17:23.376,00:17:26.671,Escape from Chorh-Gom prison is impossible!
00:17:28.923,00:17:31.718,- Oooh!
00:17:31.759,00:17:34.846,"Impressive, isn't it?"
00:17:34.888,00:17:38.098,It's very impressive.
00:17:38.140,00:17:40.727,"One way in, one way out."
00:17:40.768,00:17:44.939,One thousand guards and one prisoner.
00:17:44.981,00:17:47.608,"Yes, except that prisoner..."
00:17:47.650,00:17:49.443,...is Tai Lung.
00:17:53.322,00:17:55.282,Take us down.
00:18:00.580,00:18:05.960,- What are you doing?
00:18:13.300,00:18:14.802,"Oh, my."
00:18:23.853,00:18:26.940,"I'll, um..."
00:18:26.981,00:18:31.027,It's nothing to worry about.
00:18:31.069,00:18:35.489,- Crossbows! At the ready!
00:18:35.531,00:18:38.076,"Hey, tough guy, did you hear?"
00:18:38.117,00:18:42.705,"Oogway's finally gonna give someone the Dragon Scroll, and it's not gonna be you."
00:18:42.747,00:18:44.791,What are you doing?
00:18:44.832,00:18:46.459,What's he gonna do about it?
00:18:46.500,00:18:49.420,I've got him completely immobilized.
00:18:53.633,00:18:57.553,Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail? Aw.
00:18:57.595,00:18:59.346,I'm good. I've seen enough.
00:18:59.388,00:19:01.641,I'll tell Shifu he's got nothing to worry about.
00:19:01.682,00:19:05.519,"- No, he doesn't."
00:19:05.561,00:19:07.521,Can we please go now?
00:19:22.996,00:19:26.540,Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!
00:19:32.088,00:19:34.173,Wait a second!
00:19:38.511,00:19:40.847,I think there's been a slight mistake.
00:19:40.888,00:19:43.390,"Everyone seems to think that I'm, uh..."
00:19:44.767,00:19:49.605,Ooh! The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!
00:19:54.027,00:19:58.405,"Master Flying Rhino's armor, with authentic battle damage!"
00:19:58.447,00:20:00.658,Whoa!
00:20:00.700,00:20:02.576,The Sword of Heroes!
00:20:02.618,00:20:05.663,Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking.
00:20:05.705,00:20:07.165,Ow!
00:20:07.206,00:20:10.668,Trident of Destiny!
00:20:12.128,00:20:15.798,I've only seen paintings of that painting.
00:20:23.347,00:20:27.101,"Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!"
00:20:27.143,00:20:30.688,Said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu Army.
00:20:33.900,00:20:35.193,Hello.
00:20:35.234,00:20:37.361,finished sight-seeing?
00:20:37.403,00:20:39.572,"Sorry, I should have come to see you first."
00:20:39.613,00:20:41.615,- My patience is wearing thin.
00:20:41.657,00:20:44.493,"Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere."
00:20:44.535,00:20:46.996,- Would you turn around?
00:20:47.038,00:20:50.624,Hey. How's it going?
00:20:50.666,00:20:52.501,- Oh!
00:20:53.293,00:20:54.962,Someone... broke that.
00:20:55.004,00:20:57.548,But I'm gonna fix it.
00:20:58.340,00:20:59.717,...glue?
00:21:00.718,00:21:03.512,Ow! I have a splinter.
00:21:03.554,00:21:06.640,"So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior, hmm?"
00:21:06.682,00:21:09.894,"- Uh, I guess so."
00:21:09.936,00:21:11.353,You are not the Dragon Warrior.
00:21:11.395,00:21:13.522,You will never be the Dragon Warrior until...
00:21:13.564,00:21:16.692,...you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.
00:21:16.734,00:21:18.819,Whoa.
00:21:18.861,00:21:21.280,"So, how does this work?"
00:21:21.321,00:21:24.117,"Do you have a ladder, or a trampoline, or...?"
00:21:24.158,00:21:26.994,You think it's that easy?
00:21:27.036,00:21:31.498,That I'm just gonna hand you the secret - to limitless power?
00:21:31.540,00:21:34.752,One must first master the highest level of kung fu.
00:21:34.794,00:21:38.714,And that is clearly impossible if that one is someone like you.
00:21:38.756,00:21:41.675,- Someone like me?
00:21:41.717,00:21:44.720,- This fat butt! Flabby arms!
00:21:44.762,00:21:47.056,Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.
00:21:47.098,00:21:49.934,- And this ridiculous belly.
00:21:49.976,00:21:53.479,And utter disregard for personal hygiene.
00:21:53.520,00:21:55.731,"Now, wait a minute."
00:21:55.773,00:21:58.317,Don't stand that close.
00:21:58.358,00:22:00.153,"Listen, Oogway said I was..."
00:22:00.194,00:22:02.989,The Wuxi Finger Hold.
00:22:03.030,00:22:05.616,"Oh, you know this hold?"
00:22:05.658,00:22:08.452,Developed by Master Wuxi in the Third Dynasty. Yes.
00:22:08.494,00:22:11.371,Oh. Then you know what happens when I flex my pinky.
00:22:11.413,00:22:14.792,- You know the hardest part of this?
00:22:14.834,00:22:18.879,The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards.
00:22:18.921,00:22:20.965,"OK, OK, take it easy."
00:22:21.007,00:22:23.425,"Now listen closely, panda."
00:22:23.467,00:22:31.892,"Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you, I promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't! Are we clear?"
00:22:31.934,00:22:35.062,"Yeah, we're clear."
00:22:35.104,00:22:38.983,I can't wait to get started.
00:23:08.846,00:23:11.349,Ooh!
00:23:15.978,00:23:18.231,Ow! Ooh! Ow!
00:23:18.272,00:23:20.941,- Let's begin.
00:23:20.983,00:23:22.442,What?
00:23:23.736,00:23:26.155,- Now?
00:23:26.197,00:23:30.868,"Unless the great Oogway was wrong, and you are not the Dragon Warrior."
00:23:30.910,00:23:32.370,"Oh, OK, well..."
00:23:32.410,00:23:36.290,I don't know if I can do all of those moves.
00:23:36.332,00:23:39.252,"Well, if we don't try, we'll never know, will we?"
00:23:39.293,00:23:43.214,"Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level."
00:23:43.256,00:23:47.885,- And what level is that?
00:23:47.927,00:23:50.512,...let's just start at zero.
00:23:50.554,00:23:54.808,No. There is no such thing as level zero.
00:23:54.850,00:23:57.435,- Maybe I can start with that.
00:23:57.477,00:24:02.858,We use that for training children and propping the door open when it's hot.
00:24:02.900,00:24:04.235,But if you insist...
00:24:07.196,00:24:09.282,You're so much bigger than your action figures.
00:24:09.323,00:24:13.369,"Except for you, Mantis."
00:24:14.661,00:24:17.415,"Go ahead, panda."
00:24:19.292,00:24:22.502,"Um, are they gonna watch, or should I wait till they get back to work?"
00:24:22.544,00:24:23.629,Hit it.
00:24:23.670,00:24:26.006,"OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate."
00:24:26.048,00:24:28.092,Um... So I'm still digesting.
00:24:28.134,00:24:32.054,So my kung fu might not be as good as... later on.
00:24:32.096,00:24:36.183,- Just hit it.
00:24:36.225,00:24:39.603,"What you got? You got nothing, 'cause I got it right here."
00:24:39.645,00:24:42.564,You picking on my friends?
00:24:42.606,00:24:45.109,I'm coming at you with crazy feet. What you gonna do?
00:24:45.151,00:24:48.195,Come on. I'm a blur.
00:24:48.237,00:24:49.989,You've only seen praying mantis.
00:24:50.030,00:24:52.616,Or monkey style.
00:24:52.658,00:24:55.035,Or I could come at you snickety-snake.
00:24:55.077,00:24:59.706,- Would you hit it!
00:25:05.379,00:25:08.757,Why don't you try again?
00:25:10.176,00:25:11.635,How's that?
00:25:14.930,00:25:17.433,Whoa!
00:25:22.271,00:25:23.897,Ow! That hurts.
00:25:30.737,00:25:32.990,This will be easier than I thought.
00:25:33.032,00:25:35.659,I'm feeling a little nauseous!
00:25:36.494,00:25:37.786,Ow! Those are hard!
00:25:41.539,00:25:43.292,My tenders.
00:25:56.180,00:25:58.307,Uh-oh. Ahhh!
00:26:11.445,00:26:13.155,How did I do?
00:26:13.197,00:26:17.159,There is now a level zero.
00:26:19.703,00:26:22.039,Master Oogway thinking?
00:26:22.081,00:26:24.417,The poor guy's just gonna get himself killed.
00:26:24.458,00:26:26.960,He is so mighty!
00:26:27.002,00:26:31.840,The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire!
00:26:31.882,00:26:35.677,"When he walks, the very ground shakes!"
00:26:35.719,00:26:40.057,One would think Master Oogway would choose someone who actually knew kung fu.
00:26:40.099,00:26:42.142,"Yeah, or could at least touch his toes."
00:26:42.184,00:26:44.728,- Or even see his toes.
00:26:55.239,00:26:57.283,- Ow!
00:27:08.752,00:27:13.048,- OK.
00:27:18.845,00:27:20.680,Great.
00:27:35.362,00:27:38.616,- Hi. You're up.
00:27:38.656,00:27:40.075,I was just... uh...
00:27:40.117,00:27:42.119,"Some day, huh?"
00:27:42.161,00:27:47.500,"That kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Are your biceps sore?"
00:27:47.541,00:27:53.046,"I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so, uh..."
00:27:53.088,00:27:56.342,"Yeah, I should probably get to sleep now."
00:27:56.383,00:27:58.885,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course."
00:27:58.927,00:28:01.847,It's just...
00:28:01.888,00:28:04.642,You guys were amazing at the Battle of Weeping River.
00:28:04.682,00:28:08.103,"Outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop. You just..."
00:28:10.814,00:28:13.317,Sorry about that.
00:28:13.359,00:28:15.986,"Look, you don't belong here."
00:28:17.530,00:28:20.491,I know. I know. You're right.
00:28:20.533,00:28:24.495,I don't have... I just...
00:28:24.537,00:28:28.165,"No, I meant you don't belong here. I mean, in this room."
00:28:28.207,00:28:29.707,This is my room.
00:28:30.876,00:28:33.003,Property of Crane.
00:28:33.045,00:28:34.921,"Oh. OK. Right, right."
00:28:34.963,00:28:37.466,you want to get to sleep.
00:28:37.508,00:28:39.426,- Yeah.
00:28:39.468,00:28:41.637,We got big things tomorrow.
00:28:41.679,00:28:46.016,All right. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.
00:28:47.851,00:28:49.687,Whoa.
00:28:49.728,00:28:50.896,What was that?
00:28:50.937,00:28:52.314,I didn't say anything.
00:28:52.356,00:28:54.650,OK. All right. Good night.
00:28:54.692,00:28:56.026,Sleep well.
00:28:58.571,00:29:00.698,That seemed a little bit awkward.
00:29:02.366,00:29:05.035,Master Tigress!
00:29:05.077,00:29:07.705,- You don't belong here.
00:29:07.746,00:29:09.289,This is your room.
00:29:09.331,00:29:12.543,"I mean, you don't belong in the Jade Palace."
00:29:12.585,00:29:21.218,"You're a disgrace to kung fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning."
00:29:26.640,00:29:28.392,Big fan!
00:29:35.608,00:29:39.653,I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
00:29:39.695,00:29:41.697,Oooh!
00:29:41.739,00:29:43.782,Is that what this is?
00:29:43.823,00:29:46.326,I thought it was just a regular peach tree.
00:29:46.368,00:29:51.582,I understand. You eat when you are upset.
00:29:51.624,00:29:55.753,Upset? I'm not upset.
00:29:56.878,00:29:59.423,So why are you so upset?
00:30:02.342,00:30:07.973,sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu.
00:30:08.014,00:30:11.644,In the history of China.
00:30:11.685,00:30:14.104,- Probably.
00:30:14.146,00:30:16.607,"Man, you should've seen them!"
00:30:16.649,00:30:21.945,- Totally.
00:30:23.905,00:30:25.658,"I mean, I'm not like the Five."
00:30:25.699,00:30:29.495,"I've got no claws, no wings, no venom."
00:30:29.536,00:30:32.623,Even Mantis has those...
00:30:34.249,00:30:37.628,Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles.
00:30:40.547,00:30:42.882,"Quit, don't quit."
00:30:42.924,00:30:46.804,"Noodles, don't noodles."
00:30:46.845,00:30:51.600,You are too concerned with what was and what will be.
00:30:51.642,00:31:01.610,"There's a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift."
00:31:01.652,00:31:04.822,That is why it is called the present.
00:31:34.518,00:31:36.895,"- Oh, no!"
00:31:36.936,00:31:39.773,Go! Go! Go!
00:31:48.365,00:31:49.949,Fire crossbows!
00:31:49.991,00:31:51.535,Fire!
00:31:53.953,00:31:55.205,Fire!
00:32:02.462,00:32:05.215,Tai Lung is free!
00:32:05.257,00:32:08.260,- You're not going anywhere!
00:32:08.301,00:32:09.636,Bring it up!
00:32:12.180,00:32:14.015,Wait! Bring it back!
00:32:32.367,00:32:36.162,- He's coming this way!
00:33:40.936,00:33:42.228,Ahh!
00:33:44.147,00:33:48.193,We're dead.
00:33:48.234,00:33:50.403,Not yet we're not. Now!
00:34:37.701,00:34:40.787,- Can we run now?
00:34:57.554,00:35:03.060,I'm glad Shifu sent you.
00:35:05.144,00:35:08.023,I was beginning to think I'd been forgotten.
00:35:08.065,00:35:09.983,Fly back there and tell them...
00:35:10.025,00:35:14.071,...the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
00:35:28.877,00:35:31.671,Panda! Panda!
00:35:31.713,00:35:33.339,Wake up!
00:35:39.972,00:35:42.933,"What do we do now, Master, with the panda gone?"
00:35:42.975,00:35:45.060,Who will be the Dragon Warrior?
00:35:45.102,00:35:51.024,"All we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed."
00:35:52.275,00:35:54.736,What are you doing here?!
00:35:54.778,00:35:56.655,"Hi! Good morning, Master!"
00:35:56.696,00:35:58.698,I thought I'd warm up a little.
00:36:00.951,00:36:01.994,You're stuck.
00:36:02.035,00:36:02.995,Stuck? Nah.
00:36:03.036,00:36:05.122,What? Stuck?
00:36:05.163,00:36:08.041,Nah. This is one of my...
00:36:08.083,00:36:10.376,- Help him.
00:36:11.419,00:36:13.964,Maybe on three.
00:36:14.798,00:36:16.215,...three.
00:36:17.717,00:36:19.552,- Thank you.
00:36:19.594,00:36:22.263,"- No, really, I appreciate..."
00:36:22.305,00:36:26.685,You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night?
00:36:26.726,00:36:30.355,It takes years to develop one's flexibility!
00:36:30.396,00:36:33.900,And years longer to apply it in combat!
00:36:34.359,00:36:35.568,Ooh...
00:36:43.409,00:36:49.499,Put that down! The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
00:36:49.541,00:36:52.627,Excellent.
00:36:52.669,00:36:54.838,Let's get started.
00:36:56.756,00:36:58.842,- Are you ready?
00:37:00.969,00:37:03.847,"I'm sorry, brother. I thought you said you were ready."
00:37:03.889,00:37:07.350,That was awesome!
00:37:12.230,00:37:13.857,Ow! Oh!
00:37:14.357,00:37:16.275,Ahh!
00:37:16.317,00:37:18.319,Ohhh.
00:37:33.543,00:37:36.504,"I've been taking it easy on you, panda. But no more."
00:37:36.546,00:37:38.840,Your next opponent will be me.
00:37:38.882,00:37:40.884,"All right! Yeah, let's go!"
00:37:43.220,00:37:45.346,Step forth.
00:37:45.388,00:37:48.808,The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness...
00:37:48.850,00:37:50.727,...and make him suffer for it.
00:37:50.769,00:37:52.229,"Oh, yeah!"
00:37:52.270,00:37:55.732,To take his strength and use it against him...
00:37:55.774,00:37:58.235,...until he finally falls...
00:37:58.276,00:37:59.402,...or quits.
00:37:59.444,00:38:01.320,But a real warrior never quits.
00:38:01.362,00:38:04.449,"Don't worry, Master."
00:38:10.371,00:38:12.665,Ow! Ow!
00:38:14.751,00:38:18.213,"If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps."
00:38:18.255,00:38:19.589,But he will.
00:38:19.631,00:38:22.008,"He's not going to quit, is he?"
00:38:22.050,00:38:24.761,"He's not going to quit bouncing, I'll tell you that."
00:38:36.564,00:38:39.609,I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better.
00:38:39.651,00:38:41.736,"Trust me, it will."
00:38:39.651,00:38:44.447,It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this...
00:38:44.489,00:38:47.200,- Fat?
00:38:47.242,00:38:49.619,- Sure you were.
00:38:47.242,00:38:52.622,- Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size?
00:38:53.623,00:38:55.792,- I'm over here.
00:38:55.834,00:38:58.170,Maybe you should look at this again.
00:38:58.211,00:39:01.298,"Oh, OK."
00:39:03.466,00:39:06.385,Stop it. Stop!
00:39:06.427,00:39:09.806,I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all...
00:39:09.848,00:39:13.476,"...but if I didn't know better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me."
00:39:18.523,00:39:21.276,I know he can seem kind of heartless...
00:39:21.318,00:39:23.528,...but he wasn't always like that.
00:39:23.569,00:39:29.534,there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile.
00:39:31.577,00:39:32.912,But that was before.
00:39:32.954,00:39:34.497,Before what?
00:39:34.539,00:39:36.374,Before Tai Lung.
00:39:36.415,00:39:38.835,We're not really supposed to talk about him.
00:39:38.877,00:39:41.963,"Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know."
00:39:42.005,00:39:44.090,"Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung."
00:39:44.132,00:39:47.010,He was a student.
00:39:44.132,00:39:49.554,The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.
00:39:49.595,00:39:53.850,"And then he turned bad, and now he's in jail."
00:39:53.892,00:39:56.228,He wasn't just a student.
00:40:00.315,00:40:03.401,Shifu found him as a cub...
00:40:04.736,00:40:07.572,...and he raised him as his son.
00:40:10.116,00:40:13.411,And when the boy showed talent in kung fu...
00:40:14.287,00:40:16.581,...Shifu trained him.
00:40:16.622,00:40:21.711,He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.
00:40:21.753,00:40:24.422,It was never enough for Tai Lung.
00:40:26.925,00:40:28.551,He wanted the Dragon Scroll.
00:40:28.593,00:40:32.972,But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused.
00:40:33.014,00:40:37.143,"Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley."
00:40:39.312,00:40:41.231,He tried to take the scroll by force.
00:40:41.273,00:40:46.319,And Shifu had to destroy what he had created.
00:40:48.029,00:40:49.864,But how could he?
00:41:02.919,00:41:08.174,Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before.
00:41:16.141,00:41:17.683,Or since.
00:41:26.067,00:41:28.945,And now he has a chance to make things right.
00:41:28.987,00:41:31.239,To train the true Dragon Warrior.
00:41:31.281,00:41:34.326,And he's stuck with you.
00:41:34.367,00:41:38.871,A big fat panda who treats it like a joke.
00:41:38.913,00:41:41.249,"- Oh, that is it!"
00:41:41.291,00:41:43.501,I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.
00:41:45.586,00:41:48.381,And may have also stopped his heart.
00:41:51.717,00:41:53.636,Inner peace.
00:41:54.679,00:41:56.889,Inner peace.
00:41:59.725,00:42:01.560,Inner...
00:42:02.979,00:42:05.148,Inner peace.
00:42:07.817,00:42:12.571,Would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?!
00:42:15.658,00:42:16.826,Inner...
00:42:16.868,00:42:19.787,- Hmm...
00:42:21.456,00:42:23.582,"Oh, Zeng."
00:42:23.624,00:42:25.293,Excellent.
00:42:25.335,00:42:27.420,I could use some good news right now.
00:42:30.465,00:42:32.050,Uhhh...
00:42:34.844,00:42:37.013,- Master! Master!
00:42:37.055,00:42:41.351,I have... It's...
00:42:41.393,00:42:43.811,"Ahh, Shifu."
00:42:43.853,00:42:47.232,There is just news.
00:42:47.273,00:42:50.818,"Master, your vision."
00:42:50.860,00:42:54.613,Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way.
00:42:55.823,00:42:58.701,That is bad news...
00:42:58.743,00:43:02.539,...if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
00:43:02.580,00:43:07.293,"The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior."
00:43:07.335,00:43:10.838,He wasn't meant to be here!
00:43:10.880,00:43:13.049,There are no accidents.
00:43:13.091,00:43:17.303,You've said that already.
00:43:17.345,00:43:21.766,- Twice.
00:43:21.807,00:43:23.017,Thrice.
00:43:23.059,00:43:32.902,"My old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control."
00:43:32.944,00:43:34.446,Illusion?
00:43:34.487,00:43:37.490,"Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu."
00:43:37.532,00:43:43.871,"I cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time."
00:43:43.913,00:43:47.333,But there are things we can control.
00:43:47.375,00:43:49.627,I can control when the fruit will fall.
00:43:51.712,00:43:53.631,And I can control...
00:43:54.591,00:43:57.051,...where to plant the seed.
00:43:57.093,00:43:59.304,"That is no illusion, Master."
00:44:00.763,00:44:02.848,"Ah, yes."
00:44:02.890,00:44:08.271,But no matter what you do that seed will grow to be a peach tree.
00:44:08.313,00:44:13.067,"You may wish for an apple or an orange, but you will get a peach."
00:44:13.109,00:44:16.904,But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
00:44:16.946,00:44:19.698,Maybe it can.
00:44:19.740,00:44:22.535,If you are willing to guide it.
00:44:22.577,00:44:24.496,To nurture it.
00:44:24.537,00:44:25.871,To believe in it.
00:44:25.913,00:44:28.374,But how? How?
00:44:28.416,00:44:30.543,"I need your help, Master."
00:44:30.585,00:44:34.880,"No, you just need to believe."
00:44:34.922,00:44:37.758,"Promise me, Shifu."
00:44:37.800,00:44:40.512,Promise me you will believe.
00:44:40.553,00:44:44.349,I will try.
00:44:44.974,00:44:46.684,Good.
00:44:48.603,00:44:50.896,My time has come.
00:44:52.940,00:44:57.320,You must continue your journey without me.
00:44:57.362,00:45:00.072,What are you...? Wait!
00:45:01.240,00:45:03.242,Master!
00:45:03.284,00:45:05.077,You can't leave me!
00:45:08.623,00:45:11.501,You must believe.
00:45:12.293,00:45:14.045,Master!
00:45:44.325,00:45:50.248,"Fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province..."
00:45:50.289,00:45:52.124,...but you're a lousy tipper.
00:45:52.166,00:45:55.794,Really? So how did you get out of there alive?
00:45:55.836,00:45:58.590,"I mean, I didn't actually say that..."
00:45:58.631,00:46:00.132,...but I thought it...
00:46:00.174,00:46:01.884,...in my mind.
00:46:01.926,00:46:05.388,"If he could read my mind, he'd have been, like, What?"
00:46:05.430,00:46:09.601,Order up!
00:46:09.642,00:46:12.895,- This is really good!
00:46:12.937,00:46:14.771,Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
00:46:14.813,00:46:17.149,He actually knows the secret ingredient.
00:46:17.191,00:46:19.860,What do you talking about?
00:46:21.404,00:46:22.988,my mouth was bigger.
00:46:23.030,00:46:24.823,"Tigress, you've got to try this."
00:46:24.865,00:46:33.583,It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months on nothing but the dew of a single ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe.
00:46:33.625,00:46:38.671,I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet.
00:46:38.713,00:46:43.842,I'm gonna need a lot more than dew and universe juice.
00:46:48.013,00:46:50.891,- What?
00:46:53.102,00:46:58.983,never be the Dragon Warrior - unless you lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!
00:46:59.024,00:47:00.610,What is that noise you're making?
00:47:00.652,00:47:02.570,Laughter?
00:47:02.612,00:47:05.657,"Work hard, panda, and maybe someday..."
00:47:05.698,00:47:07.700,...you will have ears like mine.
00:47:09.034,00:47:11.287,- That's good.
00:47:11.329,00:47:14.582,Ears. It's not working for you?
00:47:14.624,00:47:17.834,- It's Shifu!
00:47:18.835,00:47:22.214,Oooh!
00:47:27.136,00:47:29.972,"Tai Lung has escaped, and you're acting like children!"
00:47:30.014,00:47:32.558,- What?
00:47:30.014,00:47:35.060,"- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him."
00:47:37.313,00:47:41.108,"And here I am, saying you got no sense of humor."
00:47:41.150,00:47:43.402,I'm gonna...
00:47:43.444,00:47:46.238,What? You're serious?
00:47:46.280,00:47:50.409,"will stop him, he did before."
00:47:50.451,00:47:53.371,- He'll do it again.
00:47:53.412,00:47:56.248,- Not anymore.
00:47:56.290,00:47:58.793,Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.
00:47:58.835,00:48:00.586,- The panda?
00:48:00.628,00:48:02.588,"Master, let us stop Tai Lung."
00:48:02.630,00:48:04.340,This is what you've trained us for.
00:48:04.382,00:48:07.968,No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung.
00:48:08.010,00:48:09.721,It is his!
00:48:09.762,00:48:10.887,Where'd he go?
00:48:18.229,00:48:21.607,You cannot leave!
00:48:21.649,00:48:23.359,Watch me.
00:48:25.778,00:48:28.322,Come on. How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
00:48:28.364,00:48:30.575,I can't even beat you to the stairs.
00:48:30.616,00:48:34.662,- You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior.
00:48:34.704,00:48:37.914,You don't believe that. Oh!
00:48:37.956,00:48:41.001,"From the first moment I got here, you've been trying to get rid of me."
00:48:41.043,00:48:43.379,Yes! I was.
00:48:43.421,00:48:48.676,But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine.
00:48:48.718,00:48:53.222,And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
00:48:53.264,00:48:57.894,Then why didn't you quit?!
00:48:57.934,00:48:59.936,"Yeah, I stayed."
00:48:59.978,00:49:12.491,"I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt, but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me."
00:49:12.533,00:49:17.121,"I stayed because I thought, if anyone could change me..."
00:49:17.162,00:49:20.165,...could make me... not me...
00:49:20.207,00:49:21.876,...it was you.
00:49:21.918,00:49:24.921,The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China!
00:49:24.961,00:49:26.631,But I can change you!
00:49:26.672,00:49:30.175,I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will!
00:49:30.217,00:49:34.221,Come on. Tai Lung is on his way here right now.
00:49:34.263,00:49:37.683,"Even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you..."
00:49:37.725,00:49:42.187,"...gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior, huh?"
00:49:44.315,00:49:45.483,How?
00:49:46.943,00:49:48.152,How?
00:49:51.029,00:49:53.365,- How?!
00:50:01.206,00:50:02.999,I don't know.
00:50:09.507,00:50:11.801,That's what I thought.
00:50:50.297,00:50:52.675,This is what you trained me for.
00:51:04.770,00:51:06.772,Don't try and stop me.
00:51:09.233,00:51:10.902,trying to stop you.
00:51:10.943,00:51:14.070,- What?
00:52:27.103,00:52:30.773,"What? I eat when I'm upset, OK?"
00:52:31.899,00:52:33.233,Oh. No need to explain.
00:52:33.275,00:52:35.193,I just thought you might be Monkey.
00:52:35.235,00:52:37.613,He hides his almond cookies on the top shelf.
00:52:58.300,00:53:00.011,Don't tell Monkey.
00:53:00.052,00:53:03.097,- Look at you.
00:53:03.139,00:53:06.391,"No, I mean, how did you get up there?"
00:53:06.433,00:53:09.436,I don't know. I guess that...
00:53:09.478,00:53:11.856,I don't know.
00:53:11.897,00:53:14.608,And yet you are ten feet off the ground.
00:53:14.650,00:53:17.111,And you have done a perfect spilt.
00:53:17.153,00:53:20.948,"No, this? This is just..."
00:53:20.990,00:53:22.074,...an accident.
00:53:26.537,00:53:29.623,There are no accidents.
00:53:29.665,00:53:30.916,Come with me.
00:53:38.716,00:53:42.094,I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fuey...
00:53:42.136,00:53:45.181,...but could you at least tell me where we're going?
00:53:54.940,00:53:57.442,You dragged me...
00:53:57.484,00:53:59.195,...all the way out here...
00:53:59.235,00:54:00.696,...for a bath?
00:54:04.200,00:54:09.245,Panda... we do not wash our pits in the Pool of Sacred Tears.
00:54:09.287,00:54:11.498,Huh?
00:54:11.540,00:54:14.210,This is where Oogway unraveled the mysteries...
00:54:14.250,00:54:16.336,...of harmony and focus.
00:54:16.378,00:54:19.006,This is the birthplace...
00:54:19.048,00:54:20.507,...of kung fu.
00:54:34.312,00:54:36.732,Do you want to learn kung fu?
00:54:36.774,00:54:40.986,- Yeah!
00:54:44.073,00:54:45.281,Don't cry.
00:54:52.248,00:54:58.212,"When you focus on kung fu, when you concentrate..."
00:54:58.254,00:55:00.047,"But, perhaps, that is my fault."
00:55:00.089,00:55:03.717,I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five.
00:55:03.759,00:55:06.887,I now see that the way to get through to you...
00:55:06.929,00:55:08.222,...is with this.
00:55:08.264,00:55:12.977,"- Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry."
00:55:13.018,00:55:15.938,"When you have been trained, you may eat."
00:55:17.106,00:55:18.565,Let us begin.
00:55:35.499,00:55:36.917,Yah! Yah!
00:55:53.517,00:55:54.768,Ow!
00:56:10.868,00:56:12.368,Yah!
00:56:14.496,00:56:16.248,Yah!
00:56:28.969,00:56:32.223,- Just like that?
00:56:32.264,00:56:35.767,No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?
00:56:35.809,00:56:38.603,"I vowed to train you, and you have been trained."
00:56:38.645,00:56:40.689,You are free to eat.
00:56:45.944,00:56:47.696,Enjoy.
00:56:48.947,00:56:50.574,- Hey!
00:56:50.615,00:56:53.911,I said you are free to eat.
00:56:55.037,00:56:56.705,Hey!
00:57:02.794,00:57:04.671,You are free to eat.
00:57:04.713,00:57:06.924,- Am I?!
00:57:08.300,00:57:09.927,Whooaa...
00:57:34.993,00:57:36.120,Whoo!
00:57:38.705,00:57:40.582,Ow! Ow!
00:58:33.177,00:58:34.845,I'm not hungry.
00:58:38.307,00:58:39.641,Master.
00:59:09.587,00:59:11.048,Cut it!
00:59:28.065,00:59:29.941,Where's the Dragon Warrior?
00:59:29.983,00:59:33.028,- How do you know you're not looking at her?
00:59:33.070,00:59:35.322,You think I'm a fool?
00:59:35.364,00:59:38.783,I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you!
00:59:38.825,00:59:42.329,I heard how he fell out of the sky on a ball of fire.
00:59:42.371,00:59:46.583,That he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen.
00:59:46.624,00:59:52.464,- Po?
00:59:52.506,00:59:55.675,"Finally, a worthy opponent."
00:59:55.717,00:59:59.513,- Our battle will be legendary!
01:00:18.240,01:00:20.075,We've got this. Help her.
01:00:44.266,01:00:47.478,- Monkey!
01:00:47.519,01:00:48.853,What was I thinking?!
01:00:59.156,01:01:00.324,Mantis!
01:01:05.329,01:01:06.997,Now!
01:01:21.637,01:01:25.182,- Ah!
01:01:51.749,01:01:55.212,- Shifu taught you well.
01:01:57.922,01:02:00.091,But he didn't teach you everything.
01:02:04.012,01:02:05.472,"You have done well, panda."
01:02:05.514,01:02:09.309,Done well? Done well?
01:02:09.351,01:02:10.852,I've done awesome!
01:02:12.396,01:02:15.440,The mark of a true hero is humility.
01:02:15.482,01:02:18.902,"- But, yes, you have done..."
01:02:18.943,01:02:20.278,...awesome.
01:02:21.697,01:02:26.410,- Huh?
01:02:27.536,01:02:30.914,Guys? Guys?!
01:02:30.955,01:02:34.209,"No, they're breathing. They're asleep? No, their eyes are open."
01:02:34.251,01:02:36.461,We were no match for his nerve attach.
01:02:36.503,01:02:38.796,He's gotten stronger.
01:02:38.838,01:02:41.675,Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
01:02:41.717,01:02:45.136,He's too fast!
01:02:46.930,01:02:50.434,- I thought we could stop him.
01:02:50.475,01:02:52.185,Why didn't he?
01:02:52.227,01:02:54.896,So you could come back and strike fear into our hearts.
01:02:54.938,01:03:00.402,- But it won't work.
01:03:00.444,01:03:01.695,I'm pretty scared.
01:03:01.737,01:03:03.363,"You can defeat him, panda!"
01:03:03.405,01:03:06.157,Are you kidding?
01:03:06.199,01:03:09.494,They're five masters.
01:03:09.536,01:03:13.039,But you will have the one thing that no one else does.
01:03:18.086,01:03:20.672,You really believe I'm ready?
01:03:20.714,01:03:22.466,You are...
01:03:22.507,01:03:24.008,...Po.
01:04:12.641,01:04:16.311,Behold the Dragon Scroll.
01:04:16.353,01:04:18.146,It is yours.
01:04:18.188,01:04:21.274,Wait. What happens when I read it?
01:04:21.316,01:04:25.487,No one knows. But legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing beat.
01:04:25.529,01:04:27.739,Whoa. Really? That's cool.
01:04:27.781,01:04:30.701,Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.
01:04:30.742,01:04:33.578,You will feel the universe in motion around you.
01:04:33.620,01:04:35.580,Wow! Can I punch through walls?
01:04:35.622,01:04:37.915,- Do a quadruple back flip?
01:04:37.957,01:04:39.501,- Will I have...?
01:04:39.543,01:04:41.211,- Focus.
01:04:41.252,01:04:44.130,"Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny."
01:04:44.172,01:04:46.466,Read it and become...
01:04:46.508,01:04:48.259,...the Dragon Warrior.
01:04:48.301,01:04:49.927,Whoa!
01:04:55.183,01:04:56.434,It's impossible to open.
01:04:56.476,01:05:01.356,"OK. Come on, baby."
01:05:01.398,01:05:04.484,- Thank you.
01:05:04.526,01:05:07.070,I probably loosened it up for you though.
01:05:07.111,01:05:10.114,"OK, here goes."
01:05:21.877,01:05:23.628,- It's blank.
01:05:23.670,01:05:24.880,"Here, look."
01:05:24.921,01:05:27.131,"No, I am forbidden to look upon..."
01:05:33.054,01:05:35.973,Blank. I don't...
01:05:36.015,01:05:38.309,I don't understand.
01:05:39.477,01:05:41.979,"OK. So, like..."
01:05:42.021,01:05:45.483,...Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all.
01:05:45.525,01:05:48.152,No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
01:05:48.194,01:05:52.407,"Oh, come on! Face it, he picked me by accident."
01:05:52.449,01:05:56.536,Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
01:05:56.578,01:05:59.247,But who will stop Tai Lung?
01:05:59.289,01:06:01.750,everything and everyone.
01:06:01.792,01:06:03.835,No.
01:06:03.877,01:06:05.670,Evacuate the valley.
01:06:05.712,01:06:09.173,You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.
01:06:09.215,01:06:11.843,"- What about you, Master?"
01:06:11.885,01:06:14.596,- What?
01:06:11.885,01:06:18.600,- I can hold him off long enough - for everyone to escape.
01:06:18.642,01:06:21.478,Then I will finally have paid for my mistake.
01:06:21.519,01:06:24.689,"Listen to me, all of you."
01:06:24.731,01:06:28.025,It is time for you to continue your journey without me.
01:06:28.067,01:06:31.446,I am very proud to have been your master.
01:06:52.049,01:06:54.260,We've got to get them out safely.
01:06:54.302,01:06:56.805,"Come, little one."
01:06:56.847,01:07:00.475,"Viper, gather the southern farmers. Mantis, the north."
01:07:00.517,01:07:02.393,"Crane, light the way."
01:07:21.287,01:07:24.499,"Look, it's the Dragon Warrior."
01:07:33.090,01:07:34.968,"Hey, Dad."
01:07:35.010,01:07:36.511,Po!
01:07:42.266,01:07:44.519,"Good to have you back, son."
01:07:46.855,01:07:48.272,Good to be back.
01:07:48.314,01:07:50.191,"Let's go, Po."
01:07:52.485,01:07:55.363,"So for our next shop, it's time to face it..."
01:07:55.405,01:07:59.325,...the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables...
01:07:59.367,01:08:01.369,...no longer slices.
01:08:01.411,01:08:08.459,"Also, I was thinking, maybe this time we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in."
01:08:09.627,01:08:10.962,You like that?
01:08:16.843,01:08:21.556,"Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out."
01:08:21.598,01:08:24.809,It just wasn't meant to be.
01:08:28.104,01:08:30.565,"Po, forget everything else."
01:08:30.607,01:08:32.817,Your destiny still awaits.
01:08:32.859,01:08:37.822,We are noodle folk. Broth runs deep through our veins.
01:08:37.864,01:08:40.157,"I don't know, Dad."
01:08:40.199,01:08:44.328,"Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son."
01:08:48.541,01:08:53.088,...I think it's time I told you something I should have told you...
01:08:53.129,01:08:57.092,- ...a long time ago.
01:08:58.635,01:09:02.680,The secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
01:09:02.722,01:09:05.141,Oh.
01:09:05.182,01:09:09.896,Come here.
01:09:09.938,01:09:12.440,- ...nothing.
01:09:12.482,01:09:17.403,You heard me. Nothing!
01:09:17.445,01:09:20.615,"Wait, wait."
01:09:20.657,01:09:22.867,You don't add some kind of special sauce or something?
01:09:22.909,01:09:28.205,Don't have to.
01:09:38.716,01:09:41.385,There is no secret ingredient.
01:10:03.700,01:10:06.661,"I have come home, Master."
01:10:06.703,01:10:09.956,This is no longer your home.
01:10:09.998,01:10:13.918,"Oh, yes."
01:10:13.960,01:10:16.880,So where is this Po?
01:10:16.921,01:10:19.674,Did I scare him off?
01:10:19.716,01:10:22.052,This battle is between you and me.
01:10:22.093,01:10:27.098,"So, that is how it's going to be."
01:10:27.140,01:10:29.142,That is how it must be.
01:10:43.573,01:10:47.869,I rotted in jail for 20 years because of your weakness!
01:10:47.911,01:10:50.205,Obeying your master is not weakness!
01:10:50.246,01:10:53.041,You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.
01:10:53.083,01:10:55.334,You always knew.
01:10:55.376,01:11:00.548,"But when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do?"
01:11:01.883,01:11:04.219,What did you do?!
01:11:06.221,01:11:09.432,- Nothing!
01:11:09.473,01:11:10.683,That was not my fault!
01:11:10.725,01:11:12.727,Not your fault?!
01:11:12.769,01:11:14.854,Who filled my head with dreams?!
01:11:14.896,01:11:17.065,Who drove me to train until my bones cracked?!
01:11:17.107,01:11:20.068,Who denied me my destiny?!
01:11:28.910,01:11:31.955,- It was never my decision to make!
01:11:37.127,01:11:38.669,It is now.
01:11:43.591,01:11:47.344,Give me the scroll!
01:11:47.386,01:11:48.972,I would rather die.
01:12:38.855,01:12:41.816,"All I ever did, I did to make you proud!"
01:12:41.858,01:12:44.735,"Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!"
01:12:45.611,01:12:47.530,- Tell me!
01:12:47.571,01:12:49.490,Tell me!
01:12:59.625,01:13:03.587,I have...
01:13:03.629,01:13:07.508,"From the first moment, I've been..."
01:13:07.550,01:13:09.927,...proud of you.
01:13:09.969,01:13:12.263,And it was my pride...
01:13:12.305,01:13:14.265,...that blinded me.
01:13:14.307,01:13:18.186,I loved you too much to see what you were becoming...
01:13:18.978,01:13:21.356,...what I...
01:13:21.397,01:13:23.524,...was turning you into.
01:13:24.150,01:13:26.069,I'm...
01:13:26.110,01:13:27.362,I'm sorry.
01:13:34.285,01:13:38.373,I don't want your apology.
01:13:38.414,01:13:40.208,I want my scroll!
01:13:41.918,01:13:45.796,What?!
01:13:45.838,01:13:52.469,Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll halfway across China by now.
01:13:52.511,01:13:55.431,"You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung."
01:13:55.472,01:13:59.018,Never.
01:14:05.983,01:14:07.402,Stairs.
01:14:09.653,01:14:11.530,Who are you?
01:14:11.572,01:14:16.452,"Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior."
01:14:21.791,01:14:23.834,Him? He's a panda.
01:14:23.876,01:14:27.838,"You're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?"
01:14:27.880,01:14:30.549,Don't tempt me. No.
01:14:30.591,01:14:33.928,I'm gonna use this.
01:14:33.970,01:14:35.679,You want it? Come and get it.
01:14:35.721,01:14:38.808,- Oh!
01:14:43.020,01:14:45.481,Yaaa! Whooo!
01:15:04.541,01:15:06.210,That scroll is mine!
01:15:26.397,01:15:27.606,Oh!
01:15:44.332,01:15:45.833,Whoa!
01:15:59.722,01:16:01.015,Lightning!
01:16:36.092,01:16:38.594,The scroll has given him power!
01:16:38.635,01:16:40.430,No!
01:16:44.016,01:16:46.102,- Oh!
01:17:16.632,01:17:20.595,"Finally! Oh, yes."
01:17:20.636,01:17:25.766,The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!
01:17:29.812,01:17:32.106,It's nothing!
01:17:33.899,01:17:36.693,"It's OK. I didn't get it the first time, either."
01:17:37.236,01:17:38.488,What?
01:17:39.530,01:17:41.532,There is no secret ingredient.
01:17:44.827,01:17:46.287,It's just you.
01:17:55.879,01:17:57.089,Stop it!
01:17:57.131,01:17:58.799,I'm gonna pee.
01:18:02.094,01:18:05.598,- Don't! Don't!
01:18:42.218,01:18:44.011,Oh!
01:19:10.913,01:19:12.831,You...
01:19:12.873,01:19:15.209,...can't defeat me.
01:19:19.547,01:19:20.964,You...
01:19:22.216,01:19:23.842,...you're just a big...
01:19:23.884,01:19:25.511,...fat...
01:19:25.553,01:19:26.803,...panda!
01:19:27.680,01:19:30.766,I'm not a big fat panda.
01:19:30.807,01:19:33.227,I'm the big fat panda.
01:19:35.312,01:19:36.897,The Wuxi Finger Hold!
01:19:36.939,01:19:38.357,"Oh, you know this hold?"
01:19:38.399,01:19:40.401,You're bluffing.
01:19:40.443,01:19:42.445,Shifu didn't teach you that.
01:19:42.486,01:19:44.196,Nope.
