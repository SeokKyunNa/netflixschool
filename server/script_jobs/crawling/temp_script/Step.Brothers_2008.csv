00:01:12.489,00:01:14.366,"Hey, Brennan."
00:01:14.366,00:01:16.827,"Mom, I'm watching the thing..."
00:01:16.827,00:01:18.119,...with the lady.
00:01:18.119,00:01:20.163,Okay. I'll be home around 11.
00:01:20.163,00:01:22.499,"Bye, Mom."
00:01:22.499,00:01:24.459,Let's slowly get those hips up.
00:01:24.459,00:01:27.421,Good. Now hold it right here. Great.
00:01:32.009,00:01:34.011,Dale.
00:01:34.011,00:01:36.179,"Dale, I'm leaving for the conference."
00:01:36.179,00:01:37.598,"You leave me money for pizza, Dad?"
00:01:37.598,00:01:39.850,Yeah. There's $20 on the hall table.
00:01:39.850,00:01:42.101,"Do not order pay-per-view, buddy."
00:01:42.101,00:01:45.022,But what if want wings?
00:01:45.022,00:01:46.690,"That's not enough, Dad!"
00:01:46.690,00:01:55.532,ROBERT: The RTI cochlear implant is the state-of-the-art implantable hearing device due to its input processing of sound via the speech processor.
00:01:55.532,00:02:06.794,"But the most exciting new development is the external processor, which fits directly over the ear, which eliminates the need to put your face between those breasts."
00:02:09.129,00:02:12.049,I'm sorry. Uh-- I'm just-- I'm so lost.
00:02:12.049,00:02:13.884,And this never happens to me.
00:02:13.884,00:02:16.177,Hello. Mmph.
00:02:16.177,00:02:18.138,"My name is Robert, and I play racquetball."
00:02:18.138,00:02:19.431,I collect coins.
00:02:19.431,00:02:21.391,Sweet Jesus.
00:02:21.391,00:02:28.816,"I am Nancy Huff. I know how to make tandoori chicken. I-- I contribute to NPR every single year, and I love the movies of Rob Reiner."
00:02:28.816,00:02:31.110,Pilates changed my life.
00:02:31.110,00:02:33.862,"I have a boat, and I wanna retire and sail around the world."
00:02:33.862,00:02:35.864,Oh. I love the sea!
00:02:35.864,00:02:40.285,"And I drive a Mercedes, and I have a 40-year-old son, Dale, who still lives at home."
00:02:40.285,00:02:41.536,What did you just say?
00:02:41.536,00:02:43.080,I knew I shouldn't have told you that.
00:02:43.080,00:02:47.250,I have a 39-year-old son named Brennan who still lives at home with me.
00:02:52.464,00:02:53.757,ALL: Ooh!
00:02:58.679,00:03:05.268,"I would like to thank all of you for being here with us on this fantastic, wonderful day."
00:03:05.268,00:03:08.730,"And, um, I would like to raise my glass."
00:03:08.730,00:03:11.650,Dale and I wanna welcome you to our home...
00:03:11.650,00:03:12.734,with open arms.
00:03:14.569,00:03:15.904,"Get a room, Dad."
00:03:15.904,00:03:18.448,"ROBERT: Oh, for Chri-- Dale!"
00:03:18.448,00:03:24.203,"Well, as you all know, my youngest son, Derek, couldn't be here because of an important fishing trip."
00:03:24.203,00:03:33.463,"But my other son, Brennan, uh, was going to be moving into his own place, but, um, he was recently let go from his job at PetSmart."
00:03:33.463,00:03:37.425,So he is gonna be living with us.
00:03:37.425,00:03:40.804,I wasn't fired from my job.
00:03:40.804,00:03:43.264,But you wouldn't know the difference.
00:03:43.264,00:03:45.225,I didn't want salmon!
00:03:45.225,00:03:47.186,I said it four times!
00:03:50.939,00:03:52.983,This wedding is horseshit.
00:03:57.029,00:04:00.240,Somebody's awfully quiet back there.
00:04:01.241,00:04:02.617,I'm not gonna call him Dad.
00:04:03.785,00:04:05.746,"Brennan, you're 39 years old."
00:04:05.746,00:04:07.956,I would not expect you to call him Dad.
00:04:07.956,00:04:10.250,"Well, I'm not going to, ever."
00:04:10.250,00:04:13.128,Even if there's a fire.
00:04:13.128,00:04:16.924,Robert better not get in my face...
00:04:16.924,00:04:19.384,'cause I'll drop that motherfucker.
00:04:19.384,00:04:20.886,"Jesus, Brennan."
00:04:20.886,00:04:22.512,I'm just saying...
00:04:22.512,00:04:25.265,I think you gotta think about your options.
00:04:25.265,00:04:31.230,"I know that you are technically married now, but that does not mean that they have to live here."
00:04:32.689,00:04:33.941,Dale...
00:04:33.941,00:04:35.692,I think...
00:04:35.692,00:04:37.485,it's time for a change for both of us.
00:04:38.403,00:04:41.364,"Dad. We're men, okay?"
00:04:41.364,00:04:43.992,That means a few things.
00:04:43.992,00:04:46.286,We like to shit with the door open.
00:04:46.286,00:04:47.871,We talk about pussy.
00:04:47.871,00:04:49.456,We go on riverboat gambling trips.
00:04:49.456,00:04:51.416,We make our own beef jerky.
00:04:51.416,00:04:54.086,That's what we do.
00:04:55.587,00:04:58.673,We literally have never done any of those things.
00:04:58.673,00:05:01.176,Where did he go to medical school?
00:05:01.176,00:05:03.720,He went to Northwestern and Johns Hopkins.
00:05:03.720,00:05:05.639,Is that good enough for you?
00:05:05.639,00:05:07.348,"No, it's not."
00:05:07.348,00:05:11.352,"Well, Brennan, those are very prestigious schools."
00:05:11.352,00:05:14.273,I smoked pot with Johnny Hopkins.
00:05:14.273,00:05:17.109,You don't know anyone named Johnny Hopkins.
00:05:17.109,00:05:23.157,"It was Johnny Hopkins and Sloan Kettering, and they were blazing that shit up every day."
00:05:23.157,00:05:25.826,"All right. Here's a scenario for you, Dad."
00:05:27.119,00:05:31.081,Suppose Nancy sees me coming out of the shower and decides to come on to me.
00:05:31.081,00:05:32.291,I'm looking good.
00:05:32.291,00:05:38.255,I've got a luscious V of hair going from my chest pubes down to my ball-fro.
00:05:38.255,00:05:42.383,"And she takes one look at me, and she goes: Oh, my God."
00:05:42.383,00:05:43.760,I've had the old bull.
00:05:43.760,00:05:46.972,Now I want the young calf.
00:05:46.972,00:05:48.640,And she grabs me by the wiener.
00:05:48.640,00:05:50.851,Shut the fuck up!
00:06:03.280,00:06:05.699,"Come on, Brennan."
00:06:07.784,00:06:09.410,There you are.
00:06:09.410,00:06:10.829,Hi.
00:06:10.829,00:06:13.581,"Oh, you look so cute in your moving clothes."
00:06:13.581,00:06:15.542,How was it?
00:06:15.542,00:06:17.752,The movers did everything.
00:06:20.672,00:06:22.007,Where's Brennan?
00:06:22.007,00:06:25.302,Um...he's-- He's still in the car.
00:06:25.302,00:06:26.928,It was kind of a rough drive.
00:06:26.928,00:06:29.306,"Hey, Robert."
00:06:29.306,00:06:32.226,"Hey, hey, Don."
00:06:32.226,00:06:33.392,"Right here, Don."
00:06:33.392,00:06:36.521,Can I come over this afternoon and touch your face?
00:06:36.521,00:06:37.772,"Thanks. Good luck, guys."
00:06:37.772,00:06:39.358,"ROBERT: We'll see you, Don."
00:06:39.358,00:06:42.401,"DON: Let's go, Cinnamon."
00:06:43.653,00:06:45.280,Heel! Cinnamon!
00:06:47.199,00:06:48.449,Cinnamon!
00:06:48.449,00:06:50.202,"Hi, Dale."
00:06:50.202,00:06:53.080,"Hey, Nancy. Could you make me a grilled-cheese sandwich?"
00:06:53.080,00:06:54.289,Sure.
00:06:54.289,00:06:55.999,Huh?
00:06:55.999,00:06:58.168,He's testing you to see how much he can get away with.
00:06:58.168,00:06:59.836,I see.
00:06:59.836,00:07:01.713,Look in your right hand.
00:07:01.713,00:07:03.131,I sure don't mind a bit.
00:07:03.131,00:07:04.258,I really don't.
00:07:04.258,00:07:07.344,ROBERT: I know. He's fine.
00:07:30.784,00:07:31.993,Hey.
00:07:31.993,00:07:33.745,Hey.
00:07:33.745,00:07:35.538,I'm Brennan.
00:07:35.538,00:07:37.707,I'm Dale.
00:07:37.707,00:07:39.918,But you have to call me Dragon.
00:07:41.211,00:07:43.588,You have to call me Nighthawk.
00:08:03.317,00:08:05.026,Brennan.
00:08:05.026,00:08:07.070,Ahhh.
00:08:07.070,00:08:08.529,Please don't do that.
00:08:15.870,00:08:17.205,"Now, that's enough ketchup."
00:08:17.205,00:08:18.457,Come on. Dale.
00:08:20.834,00:08:22.585,I like it.
00:08:22.585,00:08:25.672,"So, what have you been working on recently, Dale?"
00:08:25.672,00:08:27.090,Well...
00:08:28.175,00:08:29.759,I manage a baseball team.
00:08:30.927,00:08:32.720,Little League?
00:08:32.720,00:08:34.264,Fantasy league.
00:08:42.356,00:08:44.483,Why don't you take a picture?
00:08:44.483,00:08:47.652,"Why don't you stop being so confrontational, Dale."
00:08:47.652,00:08:49.237,I'm not the one staring at me.
00:08:49.237,00:08:51.656,"ROBERT: So, Brennan, how about you?"
00:08:51.656,00:08:56.119,I know you used to work at PetSmart.
00:08:56.119,00:08:59.080,"That's right, Mr. Doback."
00:08:59.080,00:09:00.874,"That's right, Robin."
00:09:00.874,00:09:02.750,Robert.
00:09:02.750,00:09:04.919,Robin.
00:09:04.919,00:09:06.129,Actually...
00:09:06.129,00:09:07.922,Brennan is a...
00:09:07.922,00:09:09.674,really talented person.
00:09:09.674,00:09:11.968,He's a very gifted singer.
00:09:11.968,00:09:13.678,"I'm really, really good."
00:09:13.678,00:09:15.305,How good?
00:09:16.306,00:09:19.809,I've been called the songbird of my generation...
00:09:19.809,00:09:21.644,by people who've heard me.
00:09:21.644,00:09:23.188,That good.
00:09:23.188,00:09:25.899,"Uh, the only trick is, is that Brennan's very..."
00:09:25.899,00:09:27.942,"heh, heh..."
00:09:27.942,00:09:31.279,"particular about who he sings in front of, so, uh..."
00:09:31.279,00:09:32.864,"I'm his mom, for example."
00:09:32.864,00:09:34.991,I've only heard him sing twice.
00:09:34.991,00:09:37.577,"That's funny that you say that, 'cause I can sing too."
00:09:37.577,00:09:39.079,"In fact, I'll sing right now."
00:09:42.832,00:09:45.252,Hey. Hey!
00:09:46.627,00:09:48.088,Uh-- Stop it!
00:09:49.839,00:09:51.508,"Stop it, Dale! Stop it!"
00:09:51.508,00:09:52.717,Stop it!
00:09:52.717,00:09:53.968,That's cute.
00:09:53.968,00:09:56.137,I remember when I had my first beer.
00:09:56.137,00:10:00.725,"Huh. Ha-ha-ha. That's so funny, the last time I heard that, I laughed so hard, I fell off my dinosaur."
00:10:00.725,00:10:02.143,"ROBERT: Stop, uh, right now."
00:10:02.143,00:10:03.728,Let's just back off.
00:10:03.728,00:10:07.524,"All right. Brennan, it's okay. It's okay."
00:10:07.524,00:10:09.317,"Hey, hey."
00:10:09.317,00:10:10.569,He said a mean thing first.
00:10:10.569,00:10:13.154,"ROBERT: All right, just-- Look, you know what--?"
00:10:13.154,00:10:16.241,"Hey, guys. Okay, sleeping arrangements."
00:10:16.241,00:10:21.371,"It's gonna be different, but, um-- Because Dale refuses to give up his office drum set."
00:10:21.371,00:10:25.250,"Um, uh, that means that, Brennan, you and Dale are gonna have to share a room."
00:10:25.250,00:10:26.793,But it's just temporary.
00:10:26.793,00:10:29.212,"Mom, we didn't talk about this."
00:10:26.793,00:10:30.380,"I-- Well, it's gonna be..."
00:10:30.380,00:10:32.715,an exciting adventure.
00:10:32.715,00:10:34.175,"You wanna show him the room, Dale?"
00:10:34.175,00:10:36.010,Show him where he can put his stuff?
00:10:38.096,00:10:40.014,NANCY: That's nice. Thank you.
00:10:40.014,00:10:41.891,"Good night, Nancy."
00:10:41.891,00:10:43.310,"Hey, listen, um..."
00:10:43.310,00:10:47.439,"I like to have a lot of fresh fruit around, and..."
00:10:47.439,00:10:49.149,chocolate chips in my pancakes. Okay?
00:10:49.149,00:10:50.525,Write it down so you don't forget.
00:10:50.525,00:10:51.776,Show him the room.
00:10:51.776,00:10:54.613,"DALE: She's Mom now, so..."
00:10:54.613,00:10:56.781,"Good night, Mom."
00:10:57.991,00:10:59.159,"Good night, Mr. Doback."
00:10:59.159,00:11:00.743,"Uh, good night, Brennan."
00:11:09.461,00:11:12.589,So just a few basic rules about the house.
00:11:12.589,00:11:18.512,"If there's any foods that you like, I suggest you put your name on them, or they will be thrown out."
00:11:18.512,00:11:20.138,By me.
00:11:20.138,00:11:23.724,"Uh, house was built in 1825 by General Custer."
00:11:23.724,00:11:25.560,I wanna show you this room.
00:11:25.560,00:11:26.853,Um...
00:11:26.853,00:11:28.980,Hold up. Ho-ho.
00:11:28.980,00:11:31.358,You see this room?
00:11:31.358,00:11:33.401,Okay. Here's the deal.
00:11:33.401,00:11:37.614,This is my office and my beat laboratory.
00:11:37.614,00:11:39.366,Okay?
00:11:39.366,00:11:45.413,"And this is the one rule of the house: Don't ever, ever, ever..."
00:11:45.413,00:11:47.999,touch my drum set.
00:11:47.999,00:11:50.001,You understand?
00:11:47.999,00:11:52.379,Don't go in there and-- Don't touch it!
00:11:52.379,00:11:54.755,There. I was at about 6 there.
00:11:54.755,00:11:56.924,You don't wanna see me go to 10.
00:11:56.924,00:11:59.093,Get your shit.
00:12:06.976,00:12:08.727,ROBERT: Honey?
00:12:08.727,00:12:10.021,NANCY: Hm?
00:12:10.021,00:12:13.441,I think I just found a chain of islands that we can sail to after New Zealand.
00:12:13.441,00:12:14.775,That's wonderful.
00:12:16.027,00:12:19.072,"You know, I've been meaning to ask you..."
00:12:24.202,00:12:27.455,Why is it that Dale never left?
00:12:29.748,00:12:33.169,Well...Dale has always coasted off my accomplishments.
00:12:33.169,00:12:38.132,"I mean, he left college his junior year because he said he wanted to join the family business."
00:12:38.132,00:12:40.759,But you're a medical doctor.
00:12:40.759,00:12:42.429,"Believe me, I've told him that."
00:12:42.429,00:12:45.848,"But he just always says, It's all about who you know."
00:12:45.848,00:12:48.435,"I mean, I don't know where he got this sense of entitlement."
00:12:48.435,00:12:50.687,Maybe it was his mother passing.
00:12:50.687,00:12:51.938,What about Brennan?
00:12:51.938,00:12:56.109,"I mean, from what you've told me, his younger brother Derek's been quite successful."
00:12:56.109,00:13:08.413,"Well, certainly when his father and I split, that was difficult for him. And-- This one time, when Brennan was 17 and Derek was 14, and Brennan decided to enter a talent show."
00:13:08.413,00:13:13.376,He sang a song from an old pirate musical.
00:13:13.376,00:13:20.634,But Derek got his football buddies to replace the choir and sing: Brennan has a mangina.
00:13:24.262,00:13:32.687,"Finally, the audience, and even some of the nastier parents starting singing: Brennan has a mangina."
00:13:32.687,00:13:37.233,"ALL: And I have to admit, for a little while, I sort of joined in as well."
00:13:37.233,00:13:40.194,"From that day on, Brennan never sang again."
00:13:40.194,00:13:41.488,Oh.
00:13:41.488,00:13:45.575,Derek went on to win the contest by lip-synching Ice Ice Baby.
00:13:50.246,00:13:51.539,"Oh, that's a great song."
00:13:51.539,00:13:53.082,It is.
00:13:54.167,00:13:57.878,Hey. You awake?
00:13:57.878,00:13:59.422,Yeah.
00:14:02.717,00:14:05.345,I just want you to know I hate you.
00:14:05.345,00:14:07.430,So does my dad.
00:14:08.847,00:14:10.391,"Well, that's fine."
00:14:12.310,00:14:14.187,'Cause guess what.
00:14:14.187,00:14:16.523,I hate you too.
00:14:16.523,00:14:18.107,And this house...
00:14:18.107,00:14:19.900,sucks ass.
00:14:19.900,00:14:22.236,"Well, the only reason you're living here..."
00:14:22.236,00:14:24.322,is because me and my dad decided...
00:14:24.322,00:14:28.284,"that your mom was really hot, and maybe we should just both bang her."
00:14:28.284,00:14:31.287,And we'll put up with the retard in the meantime.
00:14:31.287,00:14:33.164,Who's the retard?
00:14:33.164,00:14:34.165,You.
00:14:34.165,00:14:35.709,Y'all don't say that!
00:14:35.709,00:14:37.126,Shut up.
00:14:37.126,00:14:39.462,You'll wake up my dad and get me grounded.
00:14:39.462,00:14:41.464,Just shut up.
00:14:41.464,00:14:44.509,You and your mom are hillbillies.
00:14:44.509,00:14:47.053,This is a house of learned doctors.
00:14:47.053,00:14:49.597,You're not a doctor.
00:14:49.597,00:14:52.559,"You're a big, fat curly-headed fuck."
00:14:53.476,00:14:56.270,"Oh, yeah?"
00:14:56.270,00:14:58.189,I'm a curly-headed fuck?
00:14:58.189,00:14:59.899,You better not go to sleep.
00:14:59.899,00:15:03.778,"As soon as your eyes shut, I'm gonna punch you square in the face."
00:15:03.778,00:15:09.534,"I hope you stay still when you sleep, 'cause I'm putting a rat trap between your legs."
00:15:09.534,00:15:11.661,I'm gonna take a pillowcase...
00:15:11.661,00:15:15.707,"and fill it full of bars of soap, and beat the shit out of you."
00:15:19.335,00:15:22.004,I want you out of my fucking house.
00:15:22.004,00:15:25.091,"No way, kemosabe."
00:15:25.091,00:15:27.093,This is my house now.
00:15:30.513,00:15:31.931,ROBERT: How do you like The Gilded Lady?
00:15:31.931,00:15:34.893,Mm. I wish we could retire right now.
00:15:34.893,00:15:36.436,Won't be long.
00:15:46.780,00:15:48.531,"Oh, God! It's cold!"
00:15:50.867,00:15:53.661,Hey! Is anyone listening? Help!
00:16:39.999,00:16:42.543,"Fuck you, Dale! Fuck you!"
00:16:42.543,00:16:44.671,"MAN: Obviously, you guys are hot. You know?"
00:16:44.671,00:16:47.799,MAN 2: Just revealed her cover.
00:16:47.799,00:16:50.510,A little girl-on-girl.
00:16:53.888,00:16:56.265,Hey.
00:16:58.351,00:16:59.560,Why you so sweaty?
00:16:59.560,00:17:01.479,I was watching Cops.
00:17:01.479,00:17:04.148,You're not supposed to have your feet on the couch.
00:17:28.006,00:17:29.298,"Hey, man."
00:17:30.383,00:17:31.801,Did you touch my drum set?
00:17:33.011,00:17:36.138,No.
00:17:37.557,00:17:40.601,seems like someone definitely touched my drum set.
00:17:40.601,00:17:43.980,"Yeah, that is weird."
00:17:43.980,00:17:46.399,Hey! Did you touch my drum set?!
00:17:46.399,00:17:47.734,"Hey, knock it off!"
00:17:47.734,00:17:49.819,I know you touched my drumstick...
00:17:49.819,00:17:51.779,'cause the left one has a chip in it.
00:17:52.697,00:17:54.407,"You fucking crazy, man?"
00:17:54.407,00:17:56.116,You sound insane.
00:17:56.116,00:17:58.494,Do you realize that?
00:17:58.494,00:18:00.914,"Fuck you, Brennan! I know you touched my drum set."
00:18:00.914,00:18:02.916,And I wanna hear that dirty little mouth admit it.
00:18:02.916,00:18:05.960,"You get out of my face, or I'm gonna roundhouse your ass."
00:18:05.960,00:18:08.629,"Do you swear on your mom's life that you didn't touch it, then?!"
00:18:08.629,00:18:10.256,I don't have to swear to shit!
00:18:10.256,00:18:14.635,"That's 'cause you fucking touched my drum set, 'cause I know Cops doesn't start till 4!"
00:18:17.471,00:18:18.806,Where you going?
00:18:18.806,00:18:20.600,I'm going upstairs.
00:18:20.600,00:18:24.562,'Cause I'm gonna put my nut sack on your drum set!
00:18:24.562,00:18:32.779,"Don't you do that. I am warning you right now: If you touch my drums, I will stab you in the neck with a knife!"
00:18:32.779,00:18:37.324,"If you even go in the room, I will go ape-shit."
00:18:37.324,00:18:39.077,BRENNAN: Don't wanna miss a spot.
00:18:39.077,00:18:41.579,John Bonham's playing Moby Dick for real!
00:18:41.579,00:18:44.373,Swear to God. I swear to God! No!
00:18:53.215,00:18:55.093,I warned you!
00:18:55.093,00:18:57.428,There's one rule in the house!
00:18:57.428,00:18:58.972,And you broke it!
00:19:01.015,00:19:03.225,Ow! Argh!
00:19:03.225,00:19:04.685,Ow!
00:19:08.522,00:19:10.232,I didn't touch your damn drum set!
00:19:13.820,00:19:15.195,I'm pre-diabetic!
00:19:20.242,00:19:21.869,You fucking fucker!
00:19:21.869,00:19:24.163,I'm gonna rub my balls on your mom's face!
00:19:25.873,00:19:27.125,DALE: Come back here!
00:19:29.418,00:19:31.378,You fucker!
00:19:31.378,00:19:33.047,I'll kill you!
00:19:33.047,00:19:35.675,You son of a bitch!
00:19:35.675,00:19:38.177,Your drum set's a whore!
00:19:38.177,00:19:40.554,I tea-bagged your fucking drum set!
00:19:40.554,00:19:44.308,"Well, my drum set's a guy, so that makes you gay, you fucker!"
00:19:44.308,00:19:47.478,I'll kill you! Argh!
00:19:47.478,00:19:49.229,The story has a-- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
00:19:49.229,00:19:51.273,"Dr. Doback, the phone's for you. I think it's urgent."
00:19:51.273,00:19:53.151,Hello.
00:19:53.151,00:19:55.653,"NANCY: Robert, they're like animals!"
00:19:55.653,00:19:58.280,"Please, stop screaming."
00:19:58.280,00:20:07.665,"There seems to be some savage fight going on between my son and stepson, so I-- I-- BRENNAN: Rape! Rape! Rape!"
00:20:07.665,00:20:11.251,NANCY: Stop it!
00:20:11.251,00:20:12.586,What's going on?
00:20:12.586,00:20:17.383,Robert! They won't-- They won't-- Stop it! Stop it!
00:20:17.383,00:20:19.468,"DALE: Stay out of it, Dad!"
00:20:27.393,00:20:29.645,What the fucking fuck?
00:20:31.355,00:20:32.648,DALE: Oh.
00:20:33.858,00:20:36.652,Someone got some air. Snap.
00:20:36.652,00:20:38.946,I still hate you.
00:20:38.946,00:20:41.281,Oh. Such power.
00:20:41.281,00:20:43.242,"Dad, what are you doing? It's Shark Week."
00:20:43.242,00:20:44.577,"Okay, here's the deal."
00:20:44.577,00:20:48.497,"Number one, you will fix the fucking drywall now."
00:20:48.497,00:20:51.918,"Number two, you have one month to find jobs or you're out on your asses."
00:20:51.918,00:20:54.754,"I will arrange interviews for Monday, and you will go!"
00:20:54.754,00:20:58.716,Dad. Why are you talking to me like this?
00:20:58.716,00:21:00.426,I'm not buying that crap anymore!
00:21:00.426,00:21:04.430,"Today, I saw my own son use a bicycle as a weapon."
00:21:04.430,00:21:07.433,You yelled rape at the top of your lungs.
00:21:07.433,00:21:11.854,"Mom, I honestly thought I was gonna be raped for a second."
00:21:11.854,00:21:14.523,He had the craziest look in his eyes.
00:21:14.523,00:21:17.193,"And at one point he said, Let's get it on."
00:21:17.193,00:21:20.362,That was about the fighting.
00:21:20.362,00:21:22.740,"BRENNAN: Look, I didn't touch your drum set, okay?"
00:21:22.740,00:21:27.703,I witnessed with my eyes your testicles touching my drum set.
00:21:27.703,00:21:30.497,"All right, that's it!"
00:21:30.497,00:21:32.625,You two guys leave me no choice.
00:21:32.625,00:21:34.293,No television for a week.
00:21:34.293,00:21:35.753,BOTH: What?!
00:21:35.753,00:21:37.421,"We are so serious, guys."
00:21:37.421,00:21:39.257,DALE: Are you out of your minds?
00:21:39.257,00:21:42.301,"Goes in Robert's wall safe, and it's gonna stay there."
00:21:42.301,00:21:44.344,No!
00:21:44.344,00:21:48.099,This house is a fucking prison.
00:21:48.099,00:21:51.102,In the galaxy of This Sucks Camel Dicks.
00:22:21.966,00:22:25.219,Hi. Aunt Carol. Aunt Carol.

00:22:35.395,00:22:36.689,I gotcha.
00:22:36.689,00:22:38.356,I gotcha.
00:22:40.609,00:22:41.944,Ungh!
00:22:43.279,00:22:44.446,Ugh!
00:22:44.446,00:22:46.073,"Uh, Aunt Carol's on fire."
00:23:03.216,00:23:04.675,"ROBERT: I don't know where you learned it, but I'm still sore."
00:23:04.675,00:23:07.636,"Well, there's lots more where that-- My God."
00:23:07.636,00:23:10.723,"Oh, no. What happened?"
00:23:11.640,00:23:14.310,Oh.
00:23:14.310,00:23:17.563,"Maybe Dale left the back door open, and raccoons got in."
00:23:17.563,00:23:20.233,"Uh, Nancy? Is this your purse in the freezer?"
00:23:20.233,00:23:23.236,Yes. It's Brennan.
00:23:23.236,00:23:26.906,"He sleepwalks, and he always puts my purse in the freezer."
00:23:26.906,00:23:28.615,Dale sleepwalks too.
00:23:28.615,00:23:30.910,Are you kidding me?
00:23:32.410,00:23:33.787,NANCY: What's in the--?
00:23:33.787,00:23:35.581,Couch pillows?
00:23:35.581,00:23:37.541,"Yeah, Dale."
00:23:38.918,00:23:40.336,Come on.
00:23:40.336,00:23:41.670,It's okay.
00:23:41.670,00:23:43.381,It's really hard.
00:23:43.381,00:23:45.049,It's gonna be fine.
00:23:45.049,00:23:47.176,They're gonna get jobs.
00:23:47.176,00:23:48.386,A month.
00:23:55.017,00:23:56.352,Guys.
00:23:58.312,00:23:59.730,Guys. Guys!
00:23:59.730,00:24:01.357,"I'll kill you, Leonard Nimoy."
00:24:01.357,00:24:03.525,The clown has no penis.
00:24:03.525,00:24:06.279,What kind of dreams are you guys having?
00:24:06.279,00:24:07.988,"Hey, it's 12:30."
00:24:07.988,00:24:10.991,"Brennan, your brother's coming today, so you might want to get up."
00:24:10.991,00:24:12.410,Today?
00:24:12.410,00:24:13.702,Shit.
00:24:13.702,00:24:15.829,What's your problem?
00:24:15.829,00:24:18.665,My little brother is even a bigger asshole than you are.
00:24:18.665,00:24:21.459,"MAN: All right, gang, let's really nail it this time. Here we go."
00:24:21.459,00:24:25.298,"A one, a two. A one, two, three, four."
00:24:26.464,00:24:46.693,"BOTH: ALL: All right, Tommy, you're the oldest."
00:24:46.693,00:24:48.195,I'm counting on you.
00:25:00.958,00:25:03.669,"Nice vibrato, buddy. All right."
00:25:06.380,00:25:08.715,Flat. It's so flat.
00:25:08.715,00:25:11.802,I can't even-- You don't even look good while you're singing.
00:25:11.802,00:25:13.929,The worst thing I've ever heard.
00:25:13.929,00:25:17.224,"This is $1200 a week for voice lessons, and this is what I get?"
00:25:17.224,00:25:19.059,"Okay, I'm gonna save it with the solo."
00:25:34.074,00:25:35.451,Jesus!
00:25:38.454,00:25:52.676,ALL: We-- We were so sad you guys couldn't come to the wedding.
00:25:52.676,00:25:54.094,"Oh, I know."
00:25:54.094,00:25:55.346,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:55.346,00:25:57.390,You were busy fishing with Mark Cuban.
00:25:57.390,00:25:59.557,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:25:59.557,00:26:03.145,"But we had Chris Daughtry, Jeff Probst, super-chef Bobby Flay."
00:26:03.145,00:26:05.356,"I mean, it was insane."
00:26:05.356,00:26:06.815,"My God, that's impressive."
00:26:06.815,00:26:09.402,"DEREK: We were in the Gulf, fishing bonito."
00:26:09.402,00:26:12.488,"Robert, have you ever been down to the Gulf on the bonito run?"
00:26:12.488,00:26:14.448,Always wanted to.
00:26:14.448,00:26:15.741,It is. It's gorgeous.
00:26:15.741,00:26:17.034,Are bonito fish big?
00:26:17.951,00:26:19.537,Uh-- What?
00:26:19.537,00:26:21.747,"Dale, don't interrupt when he's telling a story."
00:26:21.747,00:26:24.333,"No, it's fine, Robert."
00:26:24.333,00:26:25.709,What's this guy's deal?
00:26:25.709,00:26:27.585,"DEREK: I don't know, son. It's okay."
00:26:27.585,00:26:31.507,"Well, Dale, they are what's called a trophy fish."
00:26:31.507,00:26:34.301,"So...yeah, they're pretty big."
00:26:35.386,00:26:36.970,I'm-- I'm sorry.
00:26:38.514,00:26:40.140,"Um, anyway..."
00:26:41.767,00:26:44.437,"Oh, God, I'm sorry. Now I forget where my story was going."
00:26:44.437,00:26:45.771,"Aw, damn it, Dale."
00:26:45.771,00:26:46.813,DEREK: No-- NANCY: Robert.
00:26:46.813,00:26:48.441,What?
00:26:46.813,00:26:51.360,"What? I asked him-- No, he can join in, Robert."
00:26:51.360,00:26:53.320,"Well, I asked him twice not to interrupt."
00:26:53.320,00:26:55.573,"Gang, don't be mad at Dale for ruining the story."
00:26:55.573,00:26:57.283,And possibly the evening.
00:26:57.283,00:26:59.701,It's-- It's totally fine.
00:26:59.701,00:27:01.203,"Derek, that you do."
00:27:01.203,00:27:03.205,That you do.
00:27:03.205,00:27:04.373,Guilty as charged...
00:27:04.373,00:27:05.583,with the stories.
00:27:05.583,00:27:07.000,"Oh, God, you're impressive."
00:27:07.000,00:27:08.919,"Ah, come on."
00:27:08.919,00:27:11.255,"You know, I love talking to you."
00:27:11.255,00:27:13.673,"From across the room, I feel like we have a thing."
00:27:13.673,00:27:16.135,"You and me, man."
00:27:16.135,00:27:17.928,You're unbelievable.
00:27:17.928,00:27:20.722,I-- I never heard that laugh before.
00:27:20.722,00:27:22.266,"Dad, why are you acting so weird?"
00:27:22.266,00:27:23.476,"Oh, hey, by the way, guys."
00:27:23.476,00:27:24.935,"Where's my bro, Brennan?"
00:27:32.818,00:27:34.487,You're right about your brother.
00:27:35.404,00:27:37.655,Total dick.
00:27:37.655,00:27:39.325,Told you.
00:27:39.325,00:27:41.076,You know what?
00:27:39.325,00:27:43.745,"I still hate you, but you got a pretty awesome collection of nudie mags."
00:27:43.745,00:27:46.457,"Yeah, I got 'em from the '70s, '80s and '90s."
00:27:47.707,00:27:50.043,It's like masturbating in a time machine.
00:27:50.043,00:27:54.214,"Anyway, so I figure by the summer of 2010, we can probably set sail."
00:27:54.214,00:27:55.841,"But, uh, I think about it every day of my life."
00:27:55.841,00:27:57.259,Yeah.
00:27:57.259,00:27:59.637,"Let me ask you this, Bob."
00:27:59.637,00:28:02.055,"Well, I gotta make more money."
00:28:02.055,00:28:03.723,"I hear you, believe me."
00:28:03.723,00:28:07.811,But what if I were to tell you that I could sell this house for 30 percent above market right now?
00:28:07.811,00:28:09.146,That'd be-- That'd be great.
00:28:09.146,00:28:10.772,Yeah.
00:28:10.772,00:28:12.358,"In a heartbeat, Robby."
00:28:12.358,00:28:15.444,"Look, I got my real-estate license a few years back for shits and gigs."
00:28:15.444,00:28:19.657,"I'd even do it for four-fifths commish, 'cause you know what really gets my dick hard?"
00:28:19.657,00:28:21.074,Helping out my friends.
00:28:21.074,00:28:22.493,"Oh, that'd be fantastic."
00:28:22.493,00:28:24.119,"That'd be fanta-- Oh, my God."
00:28:24.119,00:28:26.580,"No, it would be kick-ass, bro."
00:28:26.580,00:28:27.831,Right there.
00:28:30.000,00:28:31.627,What about Dale and Brennan?
00:28:31.627,00:28:33.795,Because they-- They haven't even gotten jobs yet.
00:28:33.795,00:28:35.172,"God, change the record."
00:28:36.674,00:28:37.924,Sweet.
00:28:37.924,00:28:39.759,Ooh.
00:28:39.759,00:28:43.138,Robert. Don't talk to me like that in front of my son.
00:28:43.138,00:28:44.640,"Oh, come on."
00:28:43.138,00:28:46.266,"We're talking about our dream, the boat."
00:28:46.266,00:28:50.770,"Yeah, it's our dream, but I-- I think it all needs to be done in good time."
00:28:50.770,00:28:52.648,"I'm just saying give it some thought, okay?"
00:28:52.648,00:28:54.525,That's it.
00:28:54.525,00:28:56.860,Holy shit. Triplets.
00:28:58.237,00:29:00.573,"It's true, three's-- Three's company."
00:29:00.573,00:29:02.824,It shows tons of bush.
00:29:02.824,00:29:05.035,Careful with that.
00:29:05.035,00:29:06.579,That's a collector's item.
00:29:06.579,00:29:08.288,It's worth a lot of money.
00:29:08.288,00:29:09.748,"What's up, faggots?"
00:29:09.748,00:29:11.709,"What's up, man?"
00:29:09.748,00:29:13.168,Not gonna come down and say hi to me?
00:29:13.168,00:29:14.461,"Hi, Derek."
00:29:14.461,00:29:16.213,"Whoa, calm down, man."
00:29:16.213,00:29:17.756,Wow.
00:29:17.756,00:29:20.509,"You guys, I really like your guys' setup up here."
00:29:20.509,00:29:22.219,"What is your problem, man?"
00:29:22.219,00:29:24.346,"My problem? Oh, uh-- I don't know."
00:29:24.346,00:29:25.889,"I don't have a problem, uh, Dale."
00:29:25.889,00:29:30.769,"Actually, I have the opposite of a problem: I made over 550 K last year."
00:29:30.769,00:29:31.937,It's not about money.
00:29:31.937,00:29:33.564,"No, it's not about money."
00:29:33.564,00:29:38.193,"Well, for me, it's a little bit about money, and I made that much money last year."
00:29:38.193,00:29:43.574,I am the VP of the biggest executive helicopter-leasing company on the Western seaboard.
00:29:43.574,00:29:47.620,"Okay, I haven't had a carb since 2004."
00:29:47.620,00:29:49.037,Check these out.
00:29:49.037,00:29:50.330,"See these, boys?"
00:29:50.330,00:29:51.957,This is what I live with.
00:29:51.957,00:29:54.376,Every day I lather this up with Kiehl's in the shower.
00:29:54.376,00:29:55.877,You wanna touch this shit?
00:29:55.877,00:29:57.963,You wanna touch these bad boys?
00:29:57.963,00:29:59.673,Sorry. Not gonna happen.
00:29:59.673,00:30:01.049,Is there something you want?
00:30:01.049,00:30:03.051,"Look, I promised Mom I'd offer you a job."
00:30:03.051,00:30:06.179,"I told her it'd count as her Christmas present, so..."
00:30:06.179,00:30:08.265,No. I'm never gonna work for you.
00:30:08.265,00:30:09.683,Fine. I don't care.
00:30:09.683,00:30:11.310,"Truth is, I, uh..."
00:30:11.310,00:30:15.314,"I just smoked a J out in my car a few minutes ago, so...feeling a little spacy."
00:30:15.314,00:30:17.608,Know what I'm sa--?
00:30:17.608,00:30:19.859,"What you looking at, kemosabe?"
00:30:19.859,00:30:23.447,"You, uh-- You wanna punch me right now."
00:30:24.448,00:30:27.993,"You wanna punch me right now, but you won't."
00:30:27.993,00:30:29.411,"Do you wanna punch me too, Brennan?"
00:30:29.411,00:30:32.372,You guys both look like you might wanna hit me in the face.
00:30:32.372,00:30:34.667,You do. I can tell.
00:30:34.667,00:30:36.418,Why don't you punch me in the face?
00:30:36.418,00:30:38.378,Punch me in the fucking face.
00:30:44.551,00:30:46.136,"Oh, shit."
00:30:46.136,00:30:47.680,"Oh, no, my shoulder."
00:30:47.680,00:30:49.014,That was awesome.
00:30:49.014,00:30:50.849,Mom! Mom!
00:30:50.849,00:30:53.769,"Hey, Derek, you know what's always good for shoulder pain?"
00:30:53.769,00:30:56.229,What?
00:30:56.229,00:30:57.523,Snap.
00:30:59.525,00:31:01.485,"Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Bobby."
00:31:01.485,00:31:04.988,"Aside from that retard trying to punch me, it was actually a pretty good evening."
00:31:04.988,00:31:06.281,"It was our pleasure, son."
00:31:06.281,00:31:07.491,Why are you calling him that?
00:31:07.491,00:31:09.743,"Oh, don't."
00:31:09.743,00:31:12.912,"ROBERT: Bye, kids. I'll check out that stock you recommended, Tommy."
00:31:12.912,00:31:14.080,Excuse me.
00:31:14.080,00:31:15.541,Hi.
00:31:15.541,00:31:17.584,"Um,, I'm Alice."
00:31:17.584,00:31:21.421,"Uh, is it true that you struck Derek in the face, and he--? And he fell from the tree house?"
00:31:21.421,00:31:22.964,"Yeah. Uh, he asked me to."
00:31:22.964,00:31:25.425,"Oh, that's the most amazing thing I've ever heard."
00:31:25.425,00:31:30.972,"Um, I want you to know that tonight I am gonna pleasure myself to the image of you doing that to Derek."
00:31:30.972,00:31:32.766,You know what I mean?
00:31:32.766,00:31:34.601,Masturbate.
00:31:34.601,00:31:36.436,I am.
00:31:36.436,00:31:38.271,"Oh, Dale."
00:31:38.271,00:31:39.606,You are something.
00:31:40.774,00:31:42.984,You are something.
00:31:44.486,00:31:46.029,Y-you're something too.
00:31:46.029,00:31:49.742,I wanna roll you into a little ball and shove you up my vagina.
00:31:49.742,00:31:51.951,You could just live there.
00:31:51.951,00:31:54.496,It's warm and it's-- It's cozy.
00:31:54.496,00:31:55.914,In your vagina?
00:31:55.914,00:31:58.041,I wanna walk around with you in there and...
00:31:58.041,00:32:03.547,"just know you're-- Whenever I feel a little tickle or scratch, that it's just your hair..."
00:32:03.547,00:32:05.799,up my vagina.
00:32:05.799,00:32:07.926,Please. Just do it for me.
00:32:07.926,00:32:09.720,What's happening?
00:32:11.764,00:32:13.265,Kiss me.
00:32:16.769,00:32:20.146,I know. I know.
00:32:20.146,00:32:24.526,It's too much. It-- Mm.
00:32:25.569,00:32:27.070,"I hate my life, Dale."
00:32:28.697,00:32:30.073,"Dale, I hate my life."
00:32:30.073,00:32:32.075,I have nobody to talk to.
00:32:32.075,00:32:34.202,"Well, you seemed okay at the di-- Please."
00:32:34.202,00:32:36.288,"DEREK: Alice! Honey, come on."
00:32:36.288,00:32:38.791,"Dane Cook, pay-per-view, 20 minutes."
00:32:38.791,00:32:39.999,Let's go.
00:32:39.999,00:32:41.877,"Coming, honey."
00:32:39.999,00:32:43.629,I'm just-- I'm talking to Dale.
00:32:43.629,00:32:45.756,This is so stupid.
00:32:47.299,00:32:48.801,Call me.
00:32:48.801,00:32:50.302,I love you.
00:32:50.302,00:32:51.720,Okay.
00:32:58.143,00:32:59.436,Hey.
00:32:59.436,00:33:01.146,What'd she want?
00:33:01.146,00:33:04.232,Nothing. Who's--? Who?
00:33:05.442,00:33:06.735,Alice.
00:33:06.735,00:33:10.989,We were just talking. Not-- It was not about sex or anything.
00:33:12.157,00:33:14.284,I can't believe you hit Derek.
00:33:14.284,00:33:16.077,I know. Did you see the expression on his face?
00:33:16.077,00:33:17.245,Yeah.
00:33:17.245,00:33:19.164,That was cool.
00:33:20.415,00:33:23.543,I know that we started out as foe.
00:33:23.543,00:33:26.212,But after that courageous act...
00:33:26.212,00:33:29.549,that you showed me against the one they call Derek...
00:33:29.549,00:33:32.511,maybe someday...
00:33:32.511,00:33:34.429,we could become friends.
00:33:34.429,00:33:42.103,"Friends who ride majestic, translucent steeds, shooting flaming arrows across the Bridge of Hemdale."
00:33:43.355,00:33:46.358,"I would follow you into the mists of Avalon, if that's what you mean."
00:33:46.358,00:33:49.945,Do you wanna see something supercool that only three people have ever seen?
00:33:49.945,00:33:51.780,Shhh.
00:33:53.949,00:33:55.826,"Okay, open your eyes."
00:33:55.826,00:33:57.369,Whoa.
00:33:57.369,00:33:59.496,See that black smudge right there on the blade?
00:33:59.496,00:34:02.040,Yeah.
00:34:02.040,00:34:03.500,Pretty recognizable signature.
00:34:03.500,00:34:04.710,No.
00:34:04.710,00:34:07.337,Randy Jackson from American Idol.
00:34:07.337,00:34:10.590,Why do you have Randy Jackson's autograph on a martial arts weapon?
00:34:10.590,00:34:13.218,"'Cause I bumped into him, and all I had was this sword."
00:34:13.218,00:34:16.179,"And you're not gonna not get Randy Jackson's autograph, right?"
00:34:16.179,00:34:18.807,I would've done the exact same thing.
00:34:20.141,00:34:22.853,Now...do you wanna see something really cool?
00:34:22.853,00:34:25.188,Of course.
00:34:27.315,00:34:31.069,Industrial-strength night-vision goggles.
00:34:31.069,00:34:32.821,Holy Santa Claus shit.
00:34:32.821,00:34:35.949,Can you imagine if we had these when we were 12?
00:34:35.949,00:34:38.451,Even better. We got 'em when we're 40.
00:34:38.451,00:34:40.495,You know what's amazing?
00:34:40.495,00:34:43.040,They're not that noticeable on your face.
00:34:43.040,00:34:45.083,Right?
00:34:46.418,00:34:54.384,"I can't believe I've been living here for two weeks, and I'm walking around this place thinking I've got a huge doucher for a stepbrother."
00:34:54.384,00:34:56.929,"Secretly, you're not a doucher."
00:34:56.929,00:34:58.972,"Let's play a game, all right?"
00:34:58.972,00:35:01.391,"On the count of three, name your favorite dinosaur."
00:35:01.391,00:35:03.435,Don't even think about it.
00:35:03.435,00:35:05.395,"One, two, three."
00:35:05.395,00:35:07.355,Velociraptor.
00:35:07.355,00:35:10.734,Favorite non-pornographic magazine to masturbate to.
00:35:10.734,00:35:13.278,Good Housekeeping.
00:35:13.278,00:35:16.239,"If you were a chick, who's the one guy you'd sleep with?"
00:35:16.239,00:35:17.783,John Stamos.
00:35:17.783,00:35:18.992,What?!
00:35:18.992,00:35:20.326,Did we just become best friends?
00:35:20.326,00:35:22.037,Yep!
00:35:22.037,00:35:23.872,Do you wanna go do karate in the garage?
00:35:23.872,00:35:25.373,Yup!
00:35:35.550,00:35:37.094,Yea-haw!
00:35:44.935,00:35:46.603,Yeah!
00:35:51.566,00:35:53.902,I think they're starting to like each other.
00:35:53.902,00:35:56.613,I got a really bad feeling about this.
00:35:57.990,00:35:59.741,Sword fight!
00:35:59.741,00:36:01.159,Sword fight!
00:36:05.038,00:36:07.707,Exactly the same!
00:36:11.711,00:36:13.005,Now you're in trouble.
00:36:14.965,00:36:16.257,Come on!
00:36:16.257,00:36:18.760,"No, they're betting against you, but you can do it!"
00:36:20.261,00:36:21.638,Yeah!
00:36:23.015,00:36:24.265,Is this a bad time?
00:36:24.265,00:36:25.767,What the hell's going on?
00:36:25.767,00:36:30.647,"Ma, Mr. Doback, okay, Dale and I were just-- Please, stop calling me Mr. Doback."
00:36:30.647,00:36:32.565,Sorry. Okay.
00:36:32.565,00:36:35.652,"Mom, Doback..."
00:36:35.652,00:36:39.572,we think it would be very prudent-- Can we turn our beds into bunk beds?
00:36:39.572,00:36:40.699,Yes.
00:36:40.699,00:36:42.659,Why are you guys so sweaty?
00:36:42.659,00:36:45.495,We've already figured out how.
00:36:45.495,00:36:47.039,Here's the thing.
00:36:45.495,00:36:50.333,It would give us so much extra space in our room to do activities.
00:36:50.333,00:36:52.585,You don't need permission from us to build bunk beds.
00:36:52.585,00:36:55.172,You're adults. You can do what you want.
00:36:55.172,00:36:57.049,So...?
00:36:58.091,00:37:01.053,I'm not making myself clear.
00:37:01.053,00:37:03.680,I don't give a fuck.
00:37:03.680,00:37:06.183,"Now, you both have several interviews tomorrow."
00:37:06.183,00:37:09.477,"I would think you'd be focused on that, and not building bunk beds."
00:37:11.980,00:37:14.774,So we...?
00:37:14.774,00:37:16.068,BRENNAN: We can? No?
00:37:16.068,00:37:18.820,"Yes. Yes, you can make bunk beds."
00:37:18.820,00:37:20.113,I knew it.
00:37:20.113,00:37:21.573,You guys are not gonna regret this.
00:37:21.573,00:37:23.282,We'll get so much more activities done.
00:37:23.282,00:37:26.119,This is the funnest night ever! Ha-ha-ha!
00:37:27.746,00:37:30.040,This is so scary.
00:37:31.290,00:37:32.959,How you doing over there?
00:37:32.959,00:37:34.753,Really good.
00:37:34.753,00:37:36.171,Okay.
00:37:36.171,00:37:38.090,Does your son know anything about carpentry?
00:37:38.090,00:37:41.093,No. Not a th-- Did I hear a drill?
00:37:41.093,00:37:43.970,"Dale! Dale, no power tools!"
00:37:43.970,00:37:45.847,DALE: Whoa. What?
00:37:45.847,00:37:47.891,"You know what, I forgot."
00:37:47.891,00:37:50.102,That is not your toothbrush.
00:37:50.102,00:37:52.812,"Oh, okay. Well, I'm all done anyway."
00:37:52.812,00:37:54.106,We did it.
00:37:54.106,00:37:55.815,It looks amazing!
00:37:55.815,00:37:58.693,Look at that! That looks like what you'd buy from a store!
00:37:58.693,00:38:00.946,Should've been a bunk all along.
00:38:00.946,00:38:02.655,So much-- We could do aerobics in here.
00:38:02.655,00:38:04.699,So many activities!
00:38:04.699,00:38:06.910,Do step class.
00:38:04.699,00:38:09.162,It's making my head spin how many activities we can do.
00:38:09.162,00:38:10.914,Yeah.
00:38:15.585,00:38:17.003,"Hey, I never asked you."
00:38:17.003,00:38:18.922,Do you like guacamole?
00:38:18.922,00:38:20.173,Ah!
00:38:20.173,00:38:22.717,"Oh, Brennan! Oh, God!"
00:38:22.717,00:38:25.011,Brennan! Brennan!
00:38:25.011,00:38:27.764,Dad. Nancy.
00:38:27.764,00:38:29.975,It's so bad.
00:38:29.975,00:38:31.559,The bunk beds were a terrible idea.
00:38:31.559,00:38:33.436,Why'd you let us do that?
00:38:33.436,00:38:35.272,It's so bad!
00:38:35.272,00:38:36.731,ROBERT: How would you describe that?
00:38:36.731,00:38:38.108,Whoa.
00:38:39.358,00:38:41.194,It's not so bad.
00:38:41.194,00:38:42.528,Agh.
00:38:44.114,00:38:45.364,Put your beds back.
00:38:45.364,00:38:47.659,Rumpus time is over.
00:38:47.659,00:38:49.327,You got a big day tomorrow.
00:38:49.327,00:38:51.704,You need your eight hours.
00:38:53.665,00:38:59.545,"And although she was 88 years old, she never stopped believing."
00:38:59.545,00:39:04.676,"Coming up next, a recent study by the American Council-- Look at her. She's hot."
00:39:04.676,00:39:07.345,"Okay, guys. This is it."
00:39:07.345,00:39:09.181,"Uh, good luck."
00:39:09.181,00:39:13.893,"Dad, um, I need to borrow some clothes for the interview, since I don't have any fancy clothes."
00:39:13.893,00:39:15.603,"Go in my closet, take whatever you need."
00:39:15.603,00:39:17.105,You too. You guys gotta look sharp.
00:39:17.105,00:39:18.940,This is the most important day of our lives.
00:39:18.940,00:39:21.693,"Okay, Dad."
00:39:21.693,00:39:23.820,All right? Relax.
00:39:23.820,00:39:25.947,"This is your day, guys."
00:39:25.947,00:39:28.116,This is your one day!
00:39:29.450,00:39:32.245,Mr. Huff. Mr. Jeener is ready for your interview.
00:39:32.245,00:39:34.539,"Actually, we'll be interviewing as a team."
00:39:34.539,00:39:36.166,We're here to fuck shit up.
00:39:41.546,00:39:42.839,Move it!
00:39:51.097,00:39:53.141,Uh. Hey!
00:39:53.141,00:39:55.727,"Well, Brennan, you certainly have had a lot of jobs."
00:39:55.727,00:39:57.395,BRENNAN: I'm a bit of a spark plug.
00:39:57.395,00:40:01.733,"And, uh, Human Resources lady, when I think-- Oh, you know, it-- It's actually, it's Pam."
00:40:01.733,00:40:03.151,I'm sorry.
00:40:03.151,00:40:04.736,"Well, Pan..."
00:40:04.736,00:40:06.154,No. My name is Pam.
00:40:06.154,00:40:08.740,Are you saying Pan or Pam?
00:40:08.740,00:40:10.449,I'm saying Pam.
00:40:10.449,00:40:13.703,"Yeah, I'm sorry, who is this gentleman sitting behind you?"
00:40:13.703,00:40:17.540,"Hello, Ms. Lady. I'm Dale."
00:40:13.703,00:40:20.626,"I'm Brennan's stepbrother, and I think I might be able to help with the Pan-Pam dilemma."
00:40:20.626,00:40:22.461,"Yeah, that'd be great."
00:40:22.461,00:40:23.713,DALE: Pan-m-m.
00:40:23.713,00:40:25.798,Pam.
00:40:25.798,00:40:27.175,With an M.
00:40:27.175,00:40:29.177,There's no D. It's Pam.
00:40:29.177,00:40:32.347,"It's like comb, except P-A-N-M."
00:40:32.347,00:40:34.140,N-N. There's two N's.
00:40:34.140,00:40:35.392,M.
00:40:35.392,00:40:36.893,"No, there's just one M."
00:40:36.893,00:40:39.104,What do you say we interview you?
00:40:39.104,00:40:42.523,"Uh, all right. Yes, that's a-- A sometimes-useful exercise."
00:40:42.523,00:40:44.025,Please put your hand down.
00:40:44.025,00:40:45.318,Go ahead.
00:40:45.318,00:40:47.237,How much money do you make a year...
00:40:47.237,00:40:48.780,before taxes?
00:40:48.780,00:40:51.699,"Okay, I'm actually not comfortable answering that."
00:40:51.699,00:40:53.492,Come on!
00:40:51.699,00:40:55.995,"We're doing the interview, not you."
00:40:53.492,00:40:58.415,"Here's a shot out of a cannon: Oprah, Barbara Walters, your wife."
00:40:58.415,00:41:00.833,"You gotta fuck one, marry one, kill one. Go."
00:41:00.833,00:41:02.668,I think we're done here. Thank you.
00:41:02.668,00:41:06.631,"Okay, first of all, I needed someone to work-- Wait, shut your mouth."
00:41:06.631,00:41:10.260,I think we've had enough-- Shush up for one second.
00:41:10.260,00:41:11.510,"Wait, shut your mouth."
00:41:10.260,00:41:13.305,Shut your-- I'm sorry. What did you just say?
00:41:13.305,00:41:15.848,You're just coming off stupid.
00:41:15.848,00:41:19.894,You're wearing tuxedos to a job that requires you to clean bathrooms.
00:41:19.894,00:41:22.355,Please leave this office.
00:41:22.355,00:41:23.982,Do we get any sort of souvenir?
00:41:23.982,00:41:25.608,Get out of my office!
00:41:25.608,00:41:29.612,"I'm just looking to hire guys that I don't mind hanging out with for, like, 12 hours a day."
00:41:29.612,00:41:31.281,You guys seem like cool guys.
00:41:31.281,00:41:34.284,"Got hair similar to mine, you wear tuxedos to the interview."
00:41:34.284,00:41:36.119,"That's funny, it's ironic."
00:41:36.119,00:41:38.496,You're kind of underplaying the whole formality of it.
00:41:38.496,00:41:40.123,I think that's funny as hell.
00:41:40.123,00:41:41.458,"So let's do this, you know?"
00:41:41.458,00:41:43.209,You guys are hired.
00:41:43.209,00:41:46.171,Unless you're the weirdest guys ever and I don't see it.
00:41:46.171,00:41:47.713,Great.
00:42:04.939,00:42:06.149,Was that a fart?
00:42:06.149,00:42:07.859,I don't know.
00:42:07.859,00:42:09.694,I can taste it.
00:42:09.694,00:42:11.112,On my tongue.
00:42:11.112,00:42:13.739,Okay. I-- I'll be honest with you. I did fart.
00:42:13.739,00:42:16.951,Is that onion? Onion and-- Onion and ketchup.
00:42:16.951,00:42:19.371,It stinks. And this is a small room.
00:42:19.371,00:42:20.955,Shit.
00:42:20.955,00:42:23.500,"Okay, now the tuxedos seem kind of fucked up."
00:42:24.583,00:42:27.337,BRENNAN: God. We were so close.
00:42:28.338,00:42:29.839,"So, what do we do for jobs?"
00:42:29.839,00:42:31.883,"I mean, is your dad really gonna kick us out?"
00:42:31.883,00:42:33.426,Listen...
00:42:33.426,00:42:35.136,don't worry about my dad.
00:42:36.429,00:42:39.015,Got him sewn up.
00:42:39.015,00:42:41.476,"We've gotta start thinking bigger, though, Brennan."
00:42:42.977,00:42:45.522,"Listen, what are you really good at?"
00:42:45.522,00:42:48.316,Singing. I'm a-- I'm a world-class singer.
00:42:48.316,00:42:51.319,DALE: See? Right there.
00:42:51.319,00:42:52.945,"Now, what am I good at?"
00:42:52.945,00:42:55.990,I can shred on the drums...
00:42:55.990,00:42:57.867,"And put all that together, what do you get?"
00:42:57.867,00:43:00.703,"Um, I don't know."
00:43:00.703,00:43:02.955,"No, that's been done before. Even better."
00:43:02.955,00:43:07.877,We are gonna start an international entertainment company.
00:43:07.877,00:43:10.463,The biggest and the best.
00:43:10.463,00:43:13.716,And we're gonna call it Prestige Worldwide.
00:43:13.716,00:43:15.843,Sounds so cool.
00:43:15.843,00:43:20.139,I feel-- Feel like a lightning bolt hit the tip of my penis.
00:43:20.139,00:43:22.850,Yeah. Yeah.
00:43:22.850,00:43:25.811,We're brothers.
00:43:25.811,00:43:28.022,"To form this alliance, right?"
00:43:28.022,00:43:30.733,"That's why our parents met, so this idea could happen."
00:43:30.733,00:43:33.319,"Okay, what do we do?"
00:43:33.319,00:43:35.988,And we hit the beat laboratory right now. Let's go.
00:43:35.988,00:43:37.156,Okay.
00:43:37.156,00:43:38.866,What?
00:43:38.866,00:43:40.535,What?
00:43:40.535,00:43:42.203,4:30.
00:43:42.203,00:43:43.538,4:32.
00:43:44.914,00:43:46.583,Um...
00:43:46.583,00:43:48.667,...I-I can't go down Whitworth right now.
00:43:48.667,00:43:50.378,Okay.
00:43:50.378,00:43:52.297,We should go this way.
00:43:52.297,00:43:54.424,What's up?
00:43:54.424,00:43:56.426,Chris Gardocki.
00:43:56.426,00:43:58.636,He gets in my face.
00:43:56.426,00:44:00.721,And I just don't wanna deal with the hassle now.
00:44:00.721,00:44:02.640,Can we please go the long way?
00:44:02.640,00:44:04.642,W-- Um...down Cutler?
00:44:04.642,00:44:05.851,Yeah.
00:44:05.851,00:44:07.479,But that's 45 minutes.
00:44:07.479,00:44:09.564,"You're gonna shame me into doing this, I'll do it."
00:44:09.564,00:44:11.441,"No, you sound stupid."
00:44:11.441,00:44:14.026,"Okay, I'm stupid. Oh, man."
00:44:15.320,00:44:18.114,"Oh, God. There they are."
00:44:18.114,00:44:19.282,Totally.
00:44:19.282,00:44:21.534,"Oh, my God."
00:44:21.534,00:44:23.702,Let's make him lick dog shit.
00:44:25.746,00:44:29.250,"Hey, fag-stick."
00:44:29.250,00:44:32.086,Is that your boyfriend?
00:44:32.086,00:44:34.672,"Look, Mr. Gardocki, just leave me alone, will you?"
00:44:34.672,00:44:36.633,"Shut your mouth, esé."
00:44:36.633,00:44:40.052,"You guys just go back and have fun on your jungle gym, okay?"
00:44:40.052,00:44:42.221,Does butt buddy have a name?
00:44:42.221,00:44:47.893,"If you're referring to me as butt buddy, yes, I do have a name."
00:44:47.893,00:44:53.608,"If you don't come over here and lick that white dog shit, I'm gonna plow into your nose with my fist."
00:44:53.608,00:44:55.734,I am not licking any white dog shit.
00:44:55.734,00:44:57.570,I'll lick the dog shit if you leave us alone.
00:44:57.570,00:44:59.238,"Dale, you're not licking dog shit, okay?"
00:44:59.238,00:45:00.906,Dude-- They're kids.
00:45:00.906,00:45:03.493,"Brennan, it's just dog shit."
00:45:03.493,00:45:04.785,Hello. How are--?
00:45:04.785,00:45:07.704,"Oh, my God!"
00:45:07.704,00:45:09.207,Leave him alone!
00:45:09.207,00:45:10.416,Ow! Ow!
00:45:10.416,00:45:12.502,GIRL: Get 'em! Get 'em!
00:45:25.682,00:45:29.060,NANCY: So maybe you don't go down that way anymore.
00:45:29.060,00:45:31.020,Maybe you go the long way home.
00:45:31.020,00:45:33.939,That's what we talked about.
00:45:33.939,00:45:40.029,DALE: You know in that one scene in The Wizard of Oz when the flying monkeys pull apart the Scarecrow?
00:45:40.029,00:45:42.073,That's what it was like.
00:45:42.073,00:45:45.410,It's okay. it's okay.
00:45:45.410,00:45:47.786,Is my dad mad about the stuff that happened?
00:45:47.786,00:45:50.582,"Robert was very upset, yes."
00:45:50.582,00:45:53.334,He knows that you interviewed as a team.
00:45:53.334,00:45:55.044,And he heard about the fart.
00:45:55.044,00:45:57.129,"Oh, he did?"
00:45:57.129,00:45:58.839,"You just couldn't hold it, or you--?"
00:45:58.839,00:46:01.259,No. I thought it was gonna be silent.
00:46:01.259,00:46:03.010,It was not silent.
00:46:01.259,00:46:04.512,"Just kept going, and it made a sound."
00:46:04.512,00:46:06.138,It got louder.
00:46:06.138,00:46:10.893,"So listen, Bobby, I'll get those keys made tomorrow, and then we'll start setting up times."
00:46:10.893,00:46:12.937,ROBERT: Thank you.
00:46:14.105,00:46:15.523,"Hi, Mom."
00:46:15.523,00:46:17.024,"Okay, bye."
00:46:17.024,00:46:19.360,DEREK: Always nice to see you.
00:46:28.785,00:46:30.121,"Hey, guys."
00:46:30.121,00:46:32.457,"Looks like your free ride's over, huh?"
00:46:32.457,00:46:34.250,Have fun living on the streets.
00:46:34.250,00:46:37.462,"Okay, cool. Good chatting, you guys. Bye, Mom."
00:46:37.462,00:46:38.837,NANCY: Bye.
00:46:38.837,00:46:40.172,"See you, buddy."
00:46:42.425,00:46:44.260,What was he doing here?
00:46:44.260,00:46:46.345,We're putting the house on the market.
00:46:46.345,00:46:47.639,Where are we moving?
00:46:47.639,00:46:49.307,Is the house haunted?
00:46:49.307,00:46:55.812,"No. Nancy and I are retiring, and sailing around the world on my boat."
00:46:55.812,00:46:58.357,We are living the dream.
00:46:58.357,00:46:59.776,"Well, what about us?"
00:47:00.693,00:47:02.612,I-- I'm sorry.
00:47:02.612,00:47:10.035,Robert-- We thought that you should take responsibility for your own lives.
00:47:10.035,00:47:16.125,ROBERT: And this is the exciting part: We're going to put enough money in your accounts for a security deposit on an apartment.
00:47:16.125,00:47:18.877,What's this all about?
00:47:16.125,00:47:21.964,"NANCY: Um, more than just money, we're gonna get you another kind of support as well."
00:47:21.964,00:47:23.758,You're both gonna see therapists.
00:47:23.758,00:47:26.969,Nancy thinks it'll help.
00:47:26.969,00:47:32.684,"Hold on. We're not going on the boat, Derek's selling the house, we have to go to therapy?"
00:47:33.685,00:47:35.852,What the fuck happened?
00:47:35.852,00:47:44.779,"Look, I know this seems really, really sudden, and just sort of unfair and cruel and-- But it's nonnegotiable."
00:47:44.779,00:47:49.367,"I got a bellyful of white dog crap in me, and now you lay this shit on me?"
00:47:49.367,00:47:52.662,You're adults. It's time you started acting like adults.
00:47:52.662,00:47:53.746,Mom.
00:47:53.746,00:47:55.914,"I'm not backing down, Brennan."
00:47:55.914,00:47:57.750,Don't even try.
00:47:57.750,00:48:00.419,"I know it seems hard, but it's the best thing for both of you."
00:48:00.419,00:48:02.421,We do it because we love you.
00:48:02.421,00:48:06.300,"Dad, I'm doing this because I love you: fuck you."
00:48:06.300,00:48:08.469,Anything else?
00:48:08.469,00:48:11.180,Bon voyage! Have a great time!
00:48:12.097,00:48:13.808,"Hey, what's up, Derek?"
00:48:13.808,00:48:15.017,Yeah.
00:48:15.017,00:48:16.394,You know what?
00:48:16.394,00:48:24.943,"I'm sitting here thinking we finally got a family together here, and now it's about to be taken away from me 'cause they think we're losers."
00:48:24.943,00:48:26.987,Because they don't understand us?
00:48:26.987,00:48:28.155,Yeah.
00:48:28.155,00:48:31.908,They don't get that this lifestyle is a choice.
00:48:31.908,00:48:35.079,And all they think about is that stupid boat.
00:48:35.079,00:48:38.708,"I swear, I'm so pissed off at my mom."
00:48:38.708,00:48:42.420,"As soon as she is of age, I'm putting her in a home."
00:48:42.420,00:48:45.214,We have got to get Prestige Worldwide going.
00:48:45.214,00:48:47.466,It's the only thing that's gonna save this family.
00:48:47.466,00:48:51.928,What I was thinking we should do is have a investor presentation like they do on The Apprentice.
00:48:51.928,00:48:54.223,Yeah. We gotta start with some capital somewhere.
00:48:54.223,00:49:01.230,"Here's the thing, though: If we're gonna start a huge multinational corporation, I'm gonna have to hear you sing."
00:49:01.230,00:49:04.316,"Can't you just trust that I'm a r-really, really good singer?"
00:49:04.316,00:49:08.028,Just one song. So I know what your voice sounds like.
00:49:08.028,00:49:10.281,"Yeah, yeah. I just-- I'll just do it."
00:49:10.281,00:49:13.785,No big deal. I'll just dive into it and just start singing.
00:49:18.080,00:49:21.751,"Oh, Jesus. My heart is beating so fast right now."
00:49:21.751,00:49:24.670,"Okay, just do it."
00:49:24.670,00:50:16.180,Just-- You know. I don't know.
00:50:16.180,00:50:19.767,"I just-- I didn't want to sing too loud, because I don't wanna wake up Robert and Nancy."
00:50:19.767,00:50:21.602,My throat's sore.
00:50:19.767,00:50:23.395,I've had a sore throat for a month and a half.
00:50:23.395,00:50:28.734,And this is not an acoustic environment that's suitable to request this from me.
00:50:28.734,00:50:32.196,"You gotta know, I'm not just some guy."
00:50:32.196,00:50:36.909,"Brennan, that is the voice of an angel."
00:50:36.909,00:50:40.287,"Brennan, I can't even make eye contact with you right now."
00:50:40.287,00:50:43.165,Your voice is like a combination of Fergie and Jesus.
00:50:43.165,00:50:44.959,Why can't you do that in front of people?
00:50:44.959,00:50:47.252,Are you messing with me right now?
00:50:47.252,00:50:50.297,"It's me, Dale."
00:50:51.340,00:50:52.633,You're good.
00:50:52.633,00:50:54.134,I know.
00:50:54.134,00:51:00.892,"This is gonna sound weird, but for a second, I think you took on the shape of a unicorn."
00:51:00.892,00:51:06.605,I felt like I was hovering above my own body watching myself sing.
00:51:06.605,00:51:08.733,"Now, let's move on to other business."
00:51:08.733,00:51:12.152,"Now, first thing tomorrow, we gotta get cracking on this investor presentation."
00:51:12.152,00:51:15.280,And guess what else.
00:51:15.280,00:51:16.991,We're making a music video.
00:51:16.991,00:51:18.993,Yeah!
00:51:20.369,00:51:22.078,"Okay, what do we do about Derek and the house?"
00:51:23.748,00:51:25.833,Don't worry about him.
00:51:36.052,00:51:37.803,"Oh, it's a great nabe."
00:51:37.803,00:51:39.931,"You know, Frank Gifford used to live right down the block."
00:51:39.931,00:51:41.432,The Giff?
00:51:41.432,00:51:43.059,Right down the block.
00:51:43.059,00:51:45.937,I'm-- I'm getting a really good feeling about this.
00:51:45.937,00:51:48.064,I am so glad.
00:51:45.937,00:51:49.899,"You get us that, uh, 10-year interest-only loan, I think we got a deal."
00:51:49.899,00:51:53.109,"Hey, fuckers! Welcome to the neighborhood!"
00:51:53.109,00:51:54.361,My name is Craig.
00:51:54.361,00:51:57.031,Um...the neighbor is a Nazi?
00:51:57.031,00:51:59.617,"You guys ever need fertilizer, I've got a lot of it."
00:51:59.617,00:52:01.077,Close to 80 tons.
00:52:01.077,00:52:03.287,"Hey, folks!"
00:52:03.287,00:52:05.081,You're gonna love this neighborhood.
00:52:05.081,00:52:06.916,Every single house here recycles.
00:52:06.916,00:52:09.043,Okay. We're done here.
00:52:09.043,00:52:12.254,"Hey, Derek."
00:52:12.254,00:52:18.302,"So Dale, I don't know how much you know about therapy, but it usually starts by you telling me a little something about yourself."
00:52:18.302,00:52:23.724,"I work at a college as a janitor, even though I feel I'm smarter than most of the people there."
00:52:23.724,00:52:29.981,Sometimes I see an equation written on a blackboard-- like half an equation --and I'll just figure it out.
00:52:29.981,00:52:32.608,Is this Good Will Hunting?
00:52:32.608,00:52:35.653,It sounds a lot like the plot of Good Will Hunting.
00:52:35.653,00:52:39.615,Yeah. Anyway. My best friend is Ben Affleck.
00:52:39.615,00:52:42.868,So I thought we'd begin talking about your parents' divorce.
00:52:42.868,00:52:44.202,Okay.
00:52:44.202,00:52:46.413,How old were you when they got divorced?
00:52:46.413,00:52:47.665,Fifteen.
00:52:47.665,00:52:49.708,That's a hard age.
00:52:49.708,00:52:51.209,Yeah.
00:52:51.209,00:52:52.920,Do you wanna talk about some of those feelings?
00:52:52.920,00:52:56.256,I love you.
00:52:56.256,00:52:57.716,I love you so much.
00:52:57.716,00:52:59.677,Thank you.
00:52:57.716,00:53:03.722,And I will take that as a feeling that you have of comfortability with me.
00:53:03.722,00:53:05.724,It's more than comfortability.
00:53:05.724,00:53:07.434,"I mean, I fucking love you."
00:53:07.434,00:53:11.063,Okay. I th-- I'm just thinking about our life together.
00:53:11.063,00:53:13.607,I feel like I'm walking on a cloud.
00:53:13.607,00:53:15.943,My penis is tingling right now.
00:53:15.943,00:53:18.070,That is so off-putting.
00:53:18.070,00:53:19.864,You're not feeling this?
00:53:19.864,00:53:25.661,"In no way, shape or form do I feel any feelings of intimacy towards you in any way whatsoever."
00:53:25.661,00:53:27.913,"As you can see, you got a really dope front lawn here."
00:53:27.913,00:53:29.623,You and your homeboys can play on that.
00:53:29.623,00:53:32.126,You can just say It looks good.
00:53:32.126,00:53:33.418,Yeah.
00:53:33.418,00:53:35.211,"Oh, you got a really fresh entryway here."
00:53:35.211,00:53:37.006,Pretty awesome.
00:53:37.006,00:53:42.344,"Show you the front of the house, which is actual-- Will you vultures please give us some privacy?"
00:53:42.344,00:53:44.138,He just died last night.
00:53:44.138,00:53:45.764,What is going on here?
00:53:45.764,00:53:48.100,It was the asbestos in here.
00:53:48.100,00:53:52.604,I've seen too many dead bodies. I-- I can't-- I can't be in here. I can't.
00:53:54.982,00:53:56.400,Not bad.
00:53:56.400,00:53:58.276,"Eat shit, Derek."
00:53:58.276,00:54:00.612,"DEREK: Awesome B-day party, broheisens."
00:54:00.612,00:54:02.073,"MAN: You the man, Derek."
00:54:02.073,00:54:04.700,"DEREK: Okay, who's this from?"
00:54:04.700,00:54:06.869,"Where are the rest of my gifts, dude?"
00:54:06.869,00:54:09.080,"Totally joking around, TJ."
00:54:09.080,00:54:10.372,All right.
00:54:10.372,00:54:13.000,"Oh, yes! Yes!"
00:54:13.000,00:54:14.877,Callaway 3-wood.
00:54:14.877,00:54:16.336,MAN: Yeah!
00:54:16.336,00:54:18.172,Yeah.
00:54:18.172,00:54:21.341,"Gonna bomb it down the fairway, bitches."
00:54:23.343,00:54:26.138,"Hi, my name is Jim."
00:54:26.138,00:54:27.681,No!
00:54:27.681,00:54:29.474,"Oh, my God."
00:54:29.474,00:54:31.518,What are you doing?
00:54:31.518,00:54:33.478,Happy anniversary.
00:54:33.478,00:54:35.106,It's our second date.
00:54:35.106,00:54:37.315,Listen...
00:54:37.315,00:54:39.944,"I'm sick of being all coy and bashful, Dale. Okay?"
00:54:39.944,00:54:41.153,We're in the bathroom.
00:54:41.153,00:54:42.988,This'll just take a minute.
00:54:42.988,00:54:44.740,There's really little you can do about it.
00:54:44.740,00:54:46.617,Alice.
00:54:46.617,00:54:47.910,Agh!
00:54:47.910,00:54:50.286,It's all slippery.
00:54:50.286,00:54:52.081,"Oh! Oh, my God!"
00:54:52.081,00:54:54.959,"Ow! Oh, shh. Shh."
00:54:57.253,00:54:58.462,It's getting tingly.
00:54:58.462,00:55:00.380,"Something's gonna happen, Alice!"
00:55:08.513,00:55:10.599,"Oh, we just had sex."
00:55:10.599,00:55:12.517,Just the way I imagined it.
00:55:12.517,00:55:14.270,I like you.
00:55:15.187,00:55:16.354,I love you.
00:55:16.354,00:55:18.023,"Stay golden, Ponyboy."
00:55:18.023,00:55:20.609,I gotta pee.
00:55:20.609,00:55:22.945,"Oh, my God."
00:55:22.945,00:55:25.114,You're incredible.
00:55:25.114,00:55:27.699,Say hello to my little friend.
00:55:27.699,00:55:30.077,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
00:55:30.077,00:55:31.495,Just kidding.
00:55:31.495,00:55:32.871,It's from Scarface.
00:55:34.165,00:55:35.624,Shut the fuck up!
00:55:36.792,00:55:38.502,"Sweet-ass gift, Teej."
00:55:38.502,00:55:40.129,I got it all mapped out.
00:55:40.129,00:55:42.214,"I'm following your lead, though."
00:55:42.214,00:55:43.757,I'll get all eyes on us.
00:55:43.757,00:55:45.467,Okay.
00:55:45.467,00:55:47.678,And then we'll drop the hammer.
00:55:49.221,00:55:51.682,"Everyone, if I could have your attention, please."
00:55:51.682,00:55:55.686,"Uh, for those of you who don't know me, my name's Dale Doback."
00:55:55.686,00:55:57.353,Check.
00:55:57.353,00:56:02.193,"probably wondering why we gathered you here tonight, besides Derek's birthday."
00:56:02.193,00:56:05.696,"We got a special surprise for you, Derek, and everybody here-- Check, check."
00:56:05.696,00:56:07.072,Check.
00:56:07.072,00:56:09.074,"Dale. No, please."
00:56:09.074,00:56:11.160,I'm begging you.
00:56:11.160,00:56:13.329,"Well, just hold on a sec."
00:56:11.160,00:56:17.415,"Derek, for your birthday, we thought we'd roll out a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity."
00:56:17.415,00:56:18.709,"Happy birthday, Derek."
00:56:18.709,00:56:19.960,M-music.
00:56:23.881,00:56:27.634,"Prestige Worldwide, wide, wide, wide."
00:56:29.220,00:56:31.555,Prestige Worldwide.
00:56:31.555,00:56:33.724,The first word in entertainment.
00:56:33.724,00:56:34.933,First word.
00:56:34.933,00:56:36.810,Management.
00:56:36.810,00:56:38.770,Insurance.
00:56:38.770,00:56:41.315,Black leather gloves.
00:56:42.316,00:56:45.401,Putting in the man-hours to study the science of what you need.
00:56:45.401,00:56:48.613,"Last week, we put Liquid Paper on a bee..."
00:56:48.613,00:56:50.032,and it died.
00:56:50.032,00:56:51.616,Security.
00:56:51.616,00:56:53.118,And.
00:56:53.118,00:56:55.329,Investors?
00:56:55.329,00:56:56.914,Possibly you.
00:56:56.914,00:56:58.332,"Oh, this is classic."
00:56:56.914,00:57:06.631,This is-- DALE: We'd like to present ...the world premiere of Prestige Worldwide's first music video by our first act...
00:57:06.631,00:57:08.967,Huff and Doback.
00:57:08.967,00:57:11.262,Roll it.
00:57:12.763,00:57:16.474,"Pay close attention, Dad."
00:57:16.474,00:57:18.560,This-- This is-- This is perfect.
00:57:18.560,00:57:19.728,Is that my boat?
00:57:19.728,00:57:21.855,"BRENNAN: Yes, it is."
00:57:21.855,00:57:23.690,What are you doing on my boat? That's my boat.
00:57:39.415,00:57:41.750,That is offensive.
00:57:41.750,00:58:02.520,MAN: MAN: Are you ready for some world-class vocalization?
00:58:02.520,00:58:04.315,Get a partner.
00:58:04.315,00:58:07.151,Who's steering the boat?
00:58:07.151,00:58:08.610,Please shut up!
00:58:12.281,00:58:14.074,Oh! Agh! Agh!
00:58:17.244,00:58:20.372,Oh!
00:58:25.502,00:58:27.254,So...
00:58:27.254,00:58:29.965,big question is...
00:58:29.965,00:58:33.844,"aside from the damage to the boat, which we will fix..."
00:58:33.844,00:58:36.472,what'd you guys think of the presentation?
00:58:36.472,00:58:41.059,Brennan. I think that what you did to Robert's boat...
00:58:41.059,00:58:42.853,was horrid.
00:58:42.853,00:58:49.067,"Having said that, I think that both of you boys showed a lot of enthusiasm and inventiveness."
00:58:49.067,00:58:51.320,Yes. Thank you.
00:58:51.320,00:58:53.405,You gotta be kidding me.
00:58:53.405,00:58:56.741,"You know, they-- They destroyed our dream, and you're calling it inventive."
00:58:56.741,00:58:58.452,"No, no, no."
00:58:58.452,00:59:01.121,"Yes, you did. Yes, you did."
00:59:01.121,00:59:04.875,"It's gonna be four years, at least, before we can sail anywhere."
00:59:04.875,00:59:06.668,And you could care less. Admit it.
00:59:06.668,00:59:11.089,I will not admit that because it is not true.
00:59:11.089,00:59:19.931,"But, you know, I do think that you could show a little bit more attentiveness to your son and your stepson, who obviously need you."
00:59:19.931,00:59:21.725,"It's true, Dr. Doback."
00:59:21.725,00:59:24.811,You've been very cold and unsupportive of our dreams.
00:59:24.811,00:59:26.813,"You wrecked my fucking boat, you goon!"
00:59:26.813,00:59:28.940,Don't speak to my son like that.
00:59:28.940,00:59:31.818,"Your son's costing me $80,000."
00:59:31.818,00:59:35.072,"Look, we could bicker about this all night, but what's done is done, Dad."
00:59:35.072,00:59:36.865,Are you guys gonna invest or not?
00:59:36.865,00:59:38.158,That's it! That's it!
00:59:38.158,00:59:39.910,What are you doing?
00:59:39.910,00:59:42.371,"DALE: Dad, I can't believe you're being so stingy."
00:59:42.371,00:59:44.956,Robert. Come back down.
00:59:44.956,00:59:47.167,You jackaloons!
00:59:47.167,00:59:50.504,You're failures!
00:59:50.504,00:59:53.715,"And you're embarrassing yourself, you geriatric fuck!"
00:59:53.715,00:59:55.426,Brennan.
00:59:53.715,00:59:58.220,Two things: You keep your liver-spotted hands off my beautiful mother.
00:59:58.220,00:59:59.679,She's a saint!
00:59:59.679,01:00:02.974,"And then you sit down, and you write Dale and Brennan a check for $10,000."
01:00:02.974,01:00:04.560,"Oh, stop it."
01:00:04.560,01:00:08.646,Or I'm gonna shove one of those fake hearing devices so far up your ass...
01:00:08.646,01:00:10.607,Brennan!
01:00:08.646,01:00:13.610,...you can hear the sound of your small intestine as it produces shit!
01:00:13.610,01:00:15.820,"All right, here we go."
01:00:15.820,01:00:17.989,Somebody should've done this a long time ago.
01:00:17.989,01:00:19.283,And I'm gonna do it.
01:00:19.283,01:00:20.867,"Dad, what are you doing?"
01:00:20.867,01:00:22.869,There are consequences for your actions.
01:00:22.869,01:00:25.663,No! Robert! Oh!
01:00:25.663,01:00:27.791,"Dad, this is not the answer."
01:00:27.791,01:00:29.251,You understand me?
01:00:29.251,01:00:32.588,Certain behaviors...
01:00:32.588,01:00:35.799,will not be tolerated!
01:00:45.892,01:00:48.479,"Wow. The tree looks great, Nancy."
01:00:48.479,01:00:50.606,Really tasteful.
01:00:50.606,01:00:52.608,"Thank you, Dale."
01:00:50.606,01:00:54.401,And that's a very nice sweater you're wearing.
01:00:54.401,01:00:58.155,Ah. It was my mom's. Heh.
01:00:58.155,01:01:00.157,"Oh, and, Brennan?"
01:00:58.155,01:01:05.996,"Denise called, and she said she can't go out with you on New Year's Eve, because she's not your girlfriend, she's your therapist."
01:01:05.996,01:01:07.498,Is that what she said?
01:01:07.498,01:01:08.706,She's a rascal. Heh.
01:01:08.706,01:01:11.251,"DALE: Hey, Dad, Nancy?"
01:01:11.251,01:01:18.758,"Would it be cool if Brennan and I opened just one present each, since it's Christmas Eve?"
01:01:18.758,01:01:21.761,"I'm gonna go down to the Cheesecake Factory, have a drink."
01:01:23.888,01:01:26.891,Oh. But-- But it's Christmas Eve.
01:01:26.891,01:01:28.519,Oh. Merry Christmas.
01:01:29.478,01:01:32.147,BRENNAN: Yes.
01:01:32.147,01:01:34.650,I had my eye on one.
01:01:34.650,01:01:36.860,I hope it's what I think it is.
01:01:36.860,01:01:39.029,"Oh, my God."
01:01:39.029,01:01:40.864,"BRENNAN: Wait, Dale got Hulk Hands?"
01:01:45.869,01:01:48.539,"Well, you reek of Scotch and cheesecake."
01:01:50.040,01:01:56.463,"You know, heh, tonight at the Cheesecake Factory was the happiest that I have been in months."
01:01:57.673,01:01:59.550,"Well, then I feel very sorry for you."
01:01:59.550,01:02:01.218,Well. Just...
01:02:01.218,01:02:02.469,Nancy...
01:02:02.469,01:02:05.389,I don't know if I can ever forgive 'em for wrecking my boat.
01:02:05.389,01:02:06.640,Why are you giving up?
01:02:06.640,01:02:08.141,I'm not giving up.
01:02:08.141,01:02:10.185,You are. You're giving up on our boys.
01:02:10.185,01:02:12.270,But they're 40.
01:02:12.270,01:02:15.440,I don't care how old they are.
01:02:15.440,01:02:18.735,"Well, sometime it's got to matter how old they are."
01:02:18.735,01:02:21.655,"That's all we do, is-- Oh, sweet Jesus."
01:02:21.655,01:02:24.199,"Oh, it-- You know."
01:02:26.034,01:02:28.119,See? They're sleepwalking.
01:02:28.119,01:02:30.205,No. No.
01:02:30.205,01:02:32.624,See. Back to bed.
01:02:32.624,01:02:34.000,They'll be fine.
01:02:34.000,01:02:36.836,Just nonsense.
01:02:36.836,01:02:39.297,No. Why would you do such a thing?
01:02:39.297,01:02:41.925,"Well, because. It's-- Never, ever wake up a sleepwalker."
01:02:41.925,01:02:43.176,See. That-- That's it.
01:02:43.176,01:02:44.844,We can't ever do anything.
01:02:44.844,01:02:47.347,But they could do real harm to themselves or others.
01:02:47.347,01:02:50.100,"Oh, it's the Christmas presents."
01:02:47.347,01:02:52.561,"No, guys-- No, no, don't-- No. But-- I think we should take control."
01:02:52.561,01:02:54.979,It's always about them.
01:02:54.979,01:02:56.523,"Oh, Jesus."
01:02:56.523,01:02:58.400,"Whatever you do, don't wake them."
01:02:58.400,01:03:01.570,They might do real harm to themselves or others.
01:03:01.570,01:03:04.155,Not everybody does know that.
01:03:04.155,01:03:07.825,"Oh, not the-- No, don't-- All right, that's it!"
01:03:07.825,01:03:09.536,I'm waking 'em up!
01:03:09.536,01:03:11.162,Don't wake them up!
01:03:11.162,01:03:12.706,"Wake up, both of you."
01:03:15.125,01:03:17.961,I told you!
01:03:17.961,01:03:21.256,Stop it! Don't hurt him!
01:03:33.268,01:03:36.813,"DEREK: --grant me this one, 'cause I was pretty wasted."
01:03:36.813,01:03:44.988,"So I put my lips around that Breathalyzer, and I saw those numerals pop up: 0.079."
01:03:46.406,01:03:48.325,DEREK: So I just drove off.
01:03:48.325,01:03:50.952,I started going to Chad Michael Murray's Christmas party.
01:03:50.952,01:03:53.705,I think that was the year.
01:03:50.952,01:03:55.165,And...just driving-- I have to interrupt you.
01:03:53.705,01:03:59.503,"Robert, while the children are in the living room, I think this would be a good time to make our announcement."
01:03:59.503,01:04:01.672,What's going on?
01:04:01.672,01:04:03.173,It's over.
01:04:03.173,01:04:10.263,"I'm gonna be moving in with my friend, Jack Handle, and Nancy found a townhouse in the city."
01:04:10.263,01:04:12.265,What--? What is this?
01:04:12.265,01:04:15.852,What Robert is trying to say is that we are getting a divorce.
01:04:15.852,01:04:17.270,Don't do this.
01:04:17.270,01:04:18.772,No. No!
01:04:18.772,01:04:20.691,I could've called this one.
01:04:20.691,01:04:23.443,DEREK: Yeah.
01:04:23.443,01:04:25.320,Is it 'cause we were bad?
01:04:25.320,01:04:30.826,The main thing that Robert and I talked about is that we did not want you two to blame yourselves.
01:04:30.826,01:04:34.371,What can we do to fix it?
01:04:34.371,01:04:35.831,Why are you calling him honey?
01:04:35.831,01:04:39.501,I cannot stress this enough: It is not your fault.
01:04:39.501,01:04:41.169,Whose fault is it? Oh!
01:04:41.169,01:04:43.588,Fuck it. I wanna fucking know!
01:04:43.588,01:04:46.257,It is-- It is directly your fault.
01:04:46.257,01:04:47.551,NANCY: Robert.
01:04:47.551,01:04:49.177,You destroyed my boat.
01:04:49.177,01:04:50.970,You beat me up in your sleep.
01:04:50.970,01:04:55.475,"And worst of all, you made Nancy and I resent each other."
01:04:55.475,01:04:59.229,It is absolutely 150 percent your fault!
01:04:59.229,01:05:03.525,"Of course it's their fault. They are the two biggest dickheads, and they're living in your house."
01:05:03.525,01:05:05.360,"Shut up, Derek."
01:05:03.525,01:05:10.782,"DEREK: I'm sorry, but that-- Please don't cry like that."
01:05:14.244,01:05:15.912,DALE: Mommy!
01:05:15.912,01:05:18.540,Dale!
01:05:18.540,01:05:21.626,I told you that they would feel completely to blame.
01:05:21.626,01:05:23.378,Oh. Let's grow up.
01:05:23.378,01:05:25.296,"Excuse me, I'm going to throw up."
01:05:25.296,01:05:28.091,I think I'm gonna throw up-- Don't throw up.
01:05:28.091,01:05:29.467,--all the nice dinner that I had.
01:05:29.467,01:05:31.261,I'm gonna throw it up.
01:05:32.262,01:05:33.513,"You're not gonna throw up, Dale."
01:05:35.932,01:05:37.642,Come on.
01:05:37.642,01:05:39.477,"Oh, this is ugly."
01:05:39.477,01:05:40.729,This is not nice!
01:05:40.729,01:05:42.272,"All right, dipshits."
01:05:42.272,01:05:43.940,"Stop it, Derek."
01:05:43.940,01:05:45.316,"One, two, three..."
01:05:45.316,01:05:48.445,I don't want my picture taken right now.
01:05:55.201,01:05:58.580,"Guys, good luck, and remember, I need you out of this house by tomorrow."
01:05:58.580,01:06:01.082,No exceptions.
01:06:09.716,01:06:15.096,If there's anything you need-- anything that you boys need you just give me a call. Okay?
01:06:21.102,01:06:25.148,Hey. Are you awake?
01:06:25.148,01:06:26.983,Yeah.
01:06:29.360,01:06:33.782,I can't believe we actually have to move out of this house.
01:06:33.782,01:06:36.284,I know. I feel bad.
01:06:36.284,01:06:39.078,"Hey, you know, we don't have to whisper anymore."
01:06:39.078,01:06:40.622,Mom and Dad aren't here.
01:06:40.622,01:06:42.749,"Yeah, but...can we keep doing it, though?"
01:06:42.749,01:06:45.209,It helps me pretend that they are.
01:06:45.209,01:06:47.170,You must feel just terrible.
01:06:48.755,01:06:50.590,"I mean, I know I feel bad."
01:06:50.590,01:06:51.967,Yeah.
01:06:51.967,01:06:54.552,But I can't imagine how you feel...
01:06:54.552,01:07:00.183,after my dad looked right at you and said it's all your fault that they broke up.
01:07:00.183,01:07:04.228,That's funny.
01:07:00.183,01:07:08.817,"'Cause my mom said: If that curly-headed fuck Dale wasn't here, everything would be perfect."
01:07:09.985,01:07:11.277,You take that back.
01:07:11.277,01:07:13.613,No way. It's your fault.
01:07:13.613,01:07:15.782,You know what your problem is?
01:07:15.782,01:07:18.618,You live in a fantasyland.
01:07:15.782,01:07:21.454,"You refuse to get a job, and you don't even know what it's like to work for something."
01:07:21.454,01:07:23.247,You don't take responsibility for your actions.
01:07:23.247,01:07:25.249,And that's why this is all your fault!
01:07:25.249,01:07:28.628,"Well, you're a mama's boy who's too chicken to sing in public!"
01:07:30.463,01:07:31.840,Yeah. That's right.
01:07:31.840,01:07:34.509,"Run away, little boy."
01:07:34.509,01:07:36.135,Just avoid everything.
01:07:37.387,01:07:39.890,What are you doing?
01:07:39.890,01:07:42.976,Motherfucker!
01:07:47.022,01:07:48.857,Brennan.
01:07:54.529,01:07:56.948,"Get up, Brennan! I know you're faking. Get up!"
01:07:58.074,01:07:59.826,Get up!
01:08:05.540,01:08:07.083,Brennan?
01:08:07.083,01:08:08.835,It's just like Cold Case Files.
01:08:08.835,01:08:10.628,It's just like Cold Case Files.
01:08:10.628,01:08:12.672,It's just like Cold Case Files.
01:08:12.672,01:08:15.383,People die every day.
01:08:15.383,01:08:19.763,Give him a proper burial in an unmarked grave.
01:08:23.641,01:08:25.894,Brennan! You're alive!
01:08:25.894,01:08:27.478,I know. I'm alive.
01:08:29.940,01:08:33.026,You were dead.
01:08:33.026,01:08:34.360,I was faking.
01:08:34.360,01:08:37.655,I used ninja focus to slow my heart rate down.
01:08:37.655,01:08:40.075,What are you doing?
01:08:40.075,01:08:42.326,"I'm alive. Brennan, I'm alive."
01:08:42.326,01:08:43.745,You're waking the neighbors!
01:08:43.745,01:08:45.038,Shut up!
01:08:45.038,01:08:46.372,No.
01:08:47.457,01:08:48.833,Now I'm gonna play your drum set.
01:08:48.833,01:08:50.334,Help me.
01:08:50.334,01:08:51.586,Close your eyes.
01:08:51.586,01:08:53.379,Let the dirt just shower over you.
01:08:54.297,01:08:56.507,This is your fault.
01:08:56.507,01:08:58.802,Oh. I'm exhausted.
01:08:58.802,01:09:01.679,I'm gonna sleep good tonight.
01:09:04.140,01:09:06.350,Don't you touch my drums!
01:09:06.350,01:09:08.686,Agh!
01:09:08.686,01:09:10.271,Agh! Zombie!
01:09:11.773,01:09:13.149,"Get off me, zombie."
01:09:15.026,01:09:16.277,Get off.
01:09:28.539,01:09:30.000,I'm late for school.
01:09:30.000,01:09:32.752,"I will kiss you right on the mouth, Kenny Rogers."
01:09:34.420,01:09:37.132,Just get off me.
01:09:39.175,01:09:40.384,Ow.
01:09:40.384,01:09:42.219,So I guess it's really over.
01:09:42.219,01:09:45.348,I'd say you trying to bury me alive pretty much did it.
01:09:45.348,01:09:47.684,You know what I just realized?
01:09:47.684,01:09:50.061,You've been the one that's been dragging me down.
01:09:50.061,01:09:56.567,"Now, I'm gonna go out, and I'm gonna get a job and an apartment, and then I'm gonna get Mom and Dr. Doback back together."
01:09:56.567,01:09:59.195,"I'm gonna be the hero, and you can suck on it."
01:10:00.989,01:10:02.490,Ow.
01:10:02.490,01:10:05.451,My life was perfect before you came here.
01:10:05.451,01:10:07.954,Me and my dad had a perfect setup.
01:10:07.954,01:10:09.664,And you wrecked it.
01:10:12.792,01:10:14.127,Hey.
01:10:15.336,01:10:16.963,We're no longer brothers.
01:10:17.922,01:10:19.549,We never were.
01:10:19.549,01:10:21.968,We were stepbrothers.
01:10:33.188,01:10:34.856,Oh!
01:10:34.856,01:10:36.858,That was one of your best.
01:10:36.858,01:10:38.026,That was nice.
01:10:38.026,01:10:39.527,All right.
01:10:39.527,01:10:42.238,"Well, well, well."
01:10:42.238,01:10:45.449,"Can you give me a job, please?"
01:10:46.659,01:10:48.953,TJ. Get an office pool going.
01:10:50.205,01:10:52.874,"Give Ken Doll Crotch here two weeks, tops."
01:10:52.874,01:10:59.714,"Dr. Angel Face, I just wanted to say thank you for meeting me on such short notice."
01:10:59.714,01:11:01.049,Don't call me Angel Face.
01:11:01.049,01:11:02.175,I apologize.
01:11:02.175,01:11:10.391,"I'm, um, very alone right now, and the thing I wanna ask you to help me-- To show me how I can be a grownup."
01:11:10.391,01:11:12.393,Do I carry my high-school diploma around with me?
01:11:12.393,01:11:14.270,What do you do with your hair in the morning?
01:11:14.270,01:11:16.439,What happens if there's inclement weather?
01:11:16.439,01:11:18.233,Where do you--?
01:11:18.233,01:11:20.151,Can you wash your clothes in the dishwasher?
01:11:20.151,01:11:23.863,I-I notice that there's a long gap in your job history.
01:11:23.863,01:11:25.782,"And it said, uh..."
01:11:25.782,01:11:30.578,"for 22 years, you went Kerouac on everyone's ass?"
01:11:30.578,01:11:33.123,"Look, I'm gonna be honest with you. I really need a job."
01:11:33.123,01:11:38.962,"And I will take any position, as long as it doesn't involve having sex with old ladies for money..."
01:11:38.962,01:11:40.588,or bear traps.
01:11:40.588,01:11:42.882,Those are my two bugaboos.
01:11:42.882,01:11:46.219,There's a catering business that-- There's a temp job that's open for you.
01:11:46.219,01:11:48.554,And you get to play with fire.
01:13:01.085,01:13:03.420,"What do you want, Brennan?"
01:13:03.420,01:13:06.049,I'll just say it. I'm ready to take on the Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:13:06.049,01:13:08.051,"Oh, ho. Slow down there, Speed Racer."
01:13:08.051,01:13:10.594,"I know what it entails, and I'm ready to nail it."
01:13:10.594,01:13:13.389,"I want it, okay? I want the Catalina Wine Mixer."
01:13:13.389,01:13:15.516,"Yo, yo."
01:13:15.516,01:13:17.143,Did you tell him what's up?
01:13:17.143,01:13:18.311,Hey.
01:13:18.311,01:13:21.438,Your brother wants a shot at the Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:13:21.438,01:13:22.857,I'm ready. I'm walking tall.
01:13:22.857,01:13:24.650,Think you're ready to run with the bulls?
01:13:24.650,01:13:28.779,"I've been earning and burning, snapping necks and cashing checks."
01:13:28.779,01:13:30.365,"Screw it, let's let him do it."
01:13:30.365,01:13:33.076,"Nah, it's a win-win for me, because if you fuck up, Brennan."
01:13:33.076,01:13:34.660,If you fuck up?
01:13:34.660,01:13:36.537,I get to fire your ass.
01:13:34.660,01:13:38.539,"But if you pull it off, I look like a genius to the board."
01:13:38.539,01:13:40.124,Pow!
01:13:40.124,01:13:42.210,I get it.
01:13:42.210,01:13:45.338,"It's the Catalina fucking Wine Mixer, okay?"
01:13:45.338,01:13:47.673,Are you saying pow?
01:13:47.673,01:13:50.176,Pow!
01:13:47.673,01:13:53.930,It's the biggest helicopter-leasing event in the Western Hemisphere since 1997.
01:13:53.930,01:13:56.182,Why does he keep doing that?
01:13:53.930,01:13:58.517,I have to sell or lease at least 80 choppers to make my nut.
01:13:58.517,01:14:04.148,"And you-- You mess with my nut, Brennan, Randy here is gonna eat your dick."
01:14:04.148,01:14:05.733,Like Kobayashi.
01:14:07.902,01:14:09.362,I've seen him do it.
01:14:09.362,01:14:11.239,You've actually seen him eat a man's penis?
01:14:11.239,01:14:14.200,"It was in international waters, so they couldn't prosecute him."
01:14:14.200,01:14:16.953,"I tell you now, I'll nail it."
01:14:16.953,01:14:19.122,"Wait a second. Why do you want this so bad, Brennan?"
01:14:19.122,01:14:21.832,"What, you trying to get Mom and Dad back together or something?"
01:14:21.832,01:14:23.167,Why do I want this?
01:14:23.167,01:14:25.336,"'Cause I wanna make bank, bro."
01:14:26.254,01:14:28.214,I wanna get ass.
01:14:28.214,01:14:30.258,And I wanna drive a Range Rover.
01:14:30.258,01:14:31.801,"Okay, well, you better, Brennan."
01:14:31.801,01:14:34.137,This is the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:14:34.137,01:14:35.305,Pow! Pow!
01:14:52.655,01:14:54.490,Nancy. Ha. Hi.
01:14:54.490,01:14:57.327,Hi. What--? What are you doing here?
01:14:57.327,01:14:59.912,"Uh...well, Dale's working the function."
01:14:59.912,01:15:01.414,DALE: Guys.
01:15:01.414,01:15:03.291,"This is supposed to be jicama, not bok choy."
01:15:03.291,01:15:04.583,"Sorry, folks."
01:15:04.583,01:15:05.835,Oh.
01:15:05.835,01:15:08.254,And I-- I got an invitation from Brennan.
01:15:08.254,01:15:11.674,"Uh, can you believe Brennan put all this together?"
01:15:11.674,01:15:13.676,Mm-mm.
01:15:13.676,01:15:16.887,And now here we all are in Catalina.
01:15:16.887,01:15:18.514,"It's funny, huh?"
01:15:18.514,01:15:20.683,Yeah. It's funny.
01:15:20.683,01:15:22.435,"Oh, hey, hey, hey."
01:15:24.187,01:15:26.189,Not bad. You're nailing it.
01:15:26.189,01:15:27.482,"Thanks, Randy."
01:15:27.482,01:15:28.858,That means a lot.
01:15:28.858,01:15:33.363,"I don't know what it is about your face, but I wanna deliver one of these right in your suck hole."
01:15:33.363,01:15:34.738,Is there anything I can do to work on that--?
01:15:34.738,01:15:36.573,No. Not really.
01:15:36.573,01:15:39.285,"Again, you're doing great, man."
01:15:39.285,01:15:41.245,"We're all having a great time, having fun."
01:15:41.245,01:15:42.538,"You pulled it off, all right."
01:15:42.538,01:15:45.375,"But if you don't change your face, I'm gonna change it for you."
01:15:45.375,01:15:46.709,Okay. Okay.
01:15:46.709,01:15:52.089,"All I can do is take that in, consider it, and I'll just try to do my best version of whatever I think that would be."
01:15:52.089,01:15:54.884,"I don't even hear you, your face is driving me nuts."
01:15:54.884,01:15:56.135,"Okay. Thanks again, though."
01:15:56.135,01:15:57.345,"Oh, tits. Hold on."
01:15:57.345,01:15:59.847,"Hey-hey. Hello, Catalina Wine Mixer."
01:15:59.847,01:16:01.057,PEOPLE: Hi.
01:16:01.057,01:16:03.767,How are you?
01:16:03.767,01:16:07.813,We are California's preeminent 1980s Billy Joel cover band.
01:16:07.813,01:16:09.690,Piano Man.
01:16:09.690,01:16:11.775,"What did I just say, man?"
01:16:11.775,01:16:17.656,"All right, uh, we don't play that, so let's keep it in the late '80s and let's keep it fun."
01:16:17.656,01:16:20.117,"I hope you are, 'cause I know sometimes life can be tough."
01:16:20.117,01:16:22.953,And I know that sometimes it's hard to...
01:16:22.953,01:16:25.498,Keeping the Faith.
01:16:35.591,01:16:37.927,You guys seem to be hitting it off.
01:16:37.927,01:16:39.345,"Oh, honey."
01:16:39.345,01:16:41.305,"Oh, my God. This is the greatest party."
01:16:41.305,01:16:42.639,"Hello, Robert."
01:16:42.639,01:16:44.267,"Brennan, this is fantastic."
01:16:44.267,01:16:45.601,This is...
01:16:44.267,01:16:47.395,Well-- So impressed.
01:16:47.395,01:16:49.564,"Hi, Dad. Hi, Nancy."
01:16:49.564,01:16:51.566,"Hey, Brennan."
01:16:51.566,01:16:53.568,Thanks for hiring our catering company.
01:16:53.568,01:16:56.237,Easy decision. You guys have an outstanding track record.
01:16:56.237,01:16:58.739,"Oh. Yeah. Just like old times, huh?"
01:16:58.739,01:17:00.199,"Right, it really is."
01:17:00.199,01:17:02.285,You still have your night-vision goggles?
01:17:02.285,01:17:03.786,"No, no."
01:17:03.786,01:17:06.289,"No, I had to sell those to pay for car insurance."
01:17:06.289,01:17:07.623,Oh.
01:17:07.623,01:17:11.043,"You still breaking boards, or kicking holes in pumpkins or anything?"
01:17:11.043,01:17:13.254,No.
01:17:13.254,01:17:15.047,But I did start taking baby aspirin...
01:17:15.047,01:17:16.299,to reduce my risk for heart attack.
01:17:16.299,01:17:17.716,That makes sense.
01:17:17.716,01:17:19.676,"Gotta keep an eye on it, you know."
01:17:19.676,01:17:21.512,Knock off the sweets.
01:17:26.892,01:17:30.313,It's a tru-- It's a truly funny observation.
01:17:30.313,01:17:31.981,Yeah.
01:17:31.981,01:17:34.317,Dale. The empanadas are starting to sweat.
01:17:34.317,01:17:36.611,Okay. I better run.
01:17:36.611,01:17:38.321,"It's good to see you, Brennan."
01:17:38.321,01:17:39.572,Take care.
01:17:39.572,01:17:41.907,"Take care, Dad."
01:17:41.907,01:17:44.494,It's great to talk to him.
01:17:44.494,01:17:46.370,I gotta go too.
01:17:46.370,01:17:48.080,We should do this again.
01:17:48.080,01:17:49.748,I think it was very constructive.
01:17:53.794,01:17:56.255,Maybe grab a bite to eat?
01:17:56.255,01:17:58.048,Go to Outback Steakhouse.
01:17:58.048,01:18:00.134,I've grown very fond of that place.
01:18:01.344,01:18:03.471,Thank you for coming.
01:18:03.471,01:18:04.847,Great to see you.
01:18:06.223,01:18:09.226,"It was very nice to see you, Robert."
01:18:09.226,01:18:15.274,I think-- I think Brennan organized this whole thing to get us back together.
01:18:16.984,01:18:21.822,You have to excuse me.
01:18:21.822,01:18:24.617,It's the funniest thing. Bye-bye.
01:18:29.288,01:18:30.789,"MAN: Start the Fire, buddy!"
01:18:32.291,01:18:35.628,"Come on, man. Play something from The Stranger!"
01:18:35.628,01:18:38.506,"We strictly do '80s Joel music, sir."
01:18:41.342,01:18:43.886,Eighties Billy Joel doo-wop sucks!
01:18:43.886,01:18:46.639,"Hey, listen, motherfucker, we only sing '80s Joel!"
01:18:46.639,01:18:49.684,So take your skank hooker wife and get the fuck outta here!
01:18:51.101,01:18:52.562,Shit.
01:18:53.854,01:18:55.398,What's wrong?
01:18:55.398,01:18:57.233,Get him out of here.
01:18:57.233,01:18:58.693,Hey.
01:18:58.693,01:19:01.070,"Hey, great job, fuck face."
01:19:01.070,01:19:02.321,This party's shot.
01:19:02.321,01:19:03.739,Just relax.
01:19:02.321,01:19:07.034,I didn't realize-- I-- I didn't-- You know what?
01:19:07.034,01:19:09.745,"So this isn't even a judgment call, man."
01:19:09.745,01:19:11.414,"You're Audi 5000, my friend."
01:19:11.414,01:19:12.915,"Derek, can't we talk about this?"
01:19:12.915,01:19:14.208,DEREK: No.
01:19:14.208,01:19:16.085,Hey.
01:19:16.085,01:19:18.921,Is everything okay?
01:19:18.921,01:19:20.590,What happened to the music?
01:19:20.590,01:19:23.217,The band left.
01:19:23.217,01:19:24.719,Derek fired me.
01:19:24.719,01:19:27.263,"Ah, it's no big deal."
01:19:27.263,01:19:29.056,It's the Catalina Wine Mixer!
01:19:29.056,01:19:31.308,People have killed to be in the position that I'm in.
01:19:31.308,01:19:33.769,He's right. It's a big deal.
01:19:31.308,01:19:36.522,"Okay, here's a thought: I see an empty stage."
01:19:36.522,01:19:39.442,I see drums.
01:19:39.442,01:19:41.944,I see a microphone.
01:19:41.944,01:19:43.613,"Dad, come on."
01:19:43.613,01:19:45.740,We gave that stuff up.
01:19:45.740,01:19:47.241,Listen to me.
01:19:45.740,01:19:51.621,"Dale, look, when I was a kid-- When I was a little boy, I always wanted to be a dinosaur."
01:19:51.621,01:19:54.540,I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus Rex more than anything in the world.
01:19:54.540,01:20:01.505,"I made my arms short, and I roamed the backyard, and I-- I chased the neighborhood cats, and I growled and I roared."
01:20:01.505,01:20:03.466,Everybody knew me and was afraid of me.
01:20:03.466,01:20:09.263,"And then one day, my dad said: Bobby, you're 17. It's-- It's time to throw childish things aside."
01:20:09.263,01:20:11.599,"And I said, Okay, Pop."
01:20:11.599,01:20:14.602,"He said, Stop being a fucking dinosaur and get a job."
01:20:14.602,01:20:16.729,"But, you know..."
01:20:14.602,01:20:21.484,"I thought to myself, I'll go to medical school, I'll practice for a little while, and then I'll come back to it."
01:20:21.484,01:20:23.694,Dad-- How is that a skill?
01:20:23.694,01:20:25.321,But I forgot how to do it.
01:20:25.321,01:20:26.739,You're human.
01:20:26.739,01:20:28.532,You could never be a dinosaur.
01:20:28.532,01:20:30.493,Yeah.
01:20:30.493,01:20:32.828,Hey. I lost it.
01:20:32.828,01:20:35.038,"Well, Dad, what's the point?"
01:20:35.038,01:20:38.292,The point is don't lose your dinosaur.
01:20:38.292,01:20:41.337,"Yeah. You know, I hated the way you guys were before."
01:20:41.337,01:20:42.713,"I mean, I hated you."
01:20:42.713,01:20:46.175,But it just kills me to see you so...
01:20:46.175,01:20:47.593,crushed and normal.
01:20:47.593,01:20:49.553,"Listen to me, don't listen to me."
01:20:49.553,01:20:53.056,Prestige Worldwide. That's-- That's what you gotta do.
01:20:53.056,01:20:54.391,You're saying we should go for it.
01:20:54.391,01:20:55.892,That's what I'm saying.
01:20:57.102,01:20:58.854,"What do you think, Brennan?"
01:20:58.854,01:21:01.524,I'm so scared right now.
01:20:58.854,01:21:06.278,"I'm gonna do what's sensible: I'm gonna file for unemployment, and I'm gonna try to get a job at Enterprise Rent-A-Car."
01:21:06.278,01:21:12.409,"Because they got a excellent corporate structure, and they-- They give you the tools to be your own boss."
01:21:12.409,01:21:14.495,My dad's right.
01:21:14.495,01:21:15.912,This isn't me.
01:21:15.912,01:21:17.206,I'm fucking miserable.
01:21:17.206,01:21:19.542,I had to get up at 10:00 this morning.
01:21:19.542,01:21:21.084,And even though...
01:21:21.084,01:21:28.008,"I just got a tidal wave of nerves, I'm going up on that stage, and I'm gonna make beautiful music for a sad world."
01:21:28.008,01:21:30.511,Dale...
01:21:30.511,01:21:32.971,This crowd's gonna eat him alive.
01:21:34.890,01:21:36.600,"Wait, what's he doing up there?"
01:21:36.600,01:21:39.895,Somebody get him off the fucking stage!
01:21:39.895,01:21:41.397,Hi. How you doing?
01:21:41.397,01:21:45.025,"My name's Dale Doback, and, uh, I hope you like to kick it."
01:21:45.025,01:21:46.902,"Oh, go get 'em, Dale!"
01:21:49.321,01:21:51.448,"Get off the stage, you dick!"
01:21:51.448,01:21:53.367,Stop yelling at him.
01:21:55.160,01:21:57.079,MAN: Terrible!
01:21:57.079,01:21:58.664,He's a human being.
01:22:02.793,01:22:04.336,No.
01:22:06.672,01:22:09.132,"He's up there alone, Brennan."
01:22:14.304,01:22:15.848,"What are you doing, Brennan?"
01:22:17.015,01:22:19.184,"NANCY: Brennan, no."
01:22:20.394,01:22:22.145,What did you do?
01:22:22.145,01:22:24.732,I couldn't stand to see him like that. I miss my son.
01:22:24.732,01:22:25.941,All right.
01:22:25.941,01:22:27.526,Let me go for a few bars.
01:22:27.526,01:22:29.445,"Come in soft, but then finish strong."
01:22:29.445,01:22:30.362,Okay.
01:22:30.362,01:22:31.614,"Hey, Brennan?"
01:22:31.614,01:22:32.865,Thanks for coming up.
01:22:32.865,01:22:34.617,"You got it, Dragon."
01:22:34.617,01:22:36.744,"DALE: Okay, we've got a little change coming up."
01:22:36.744,01:22:39.329,"It's my main man, Brennan."
01:24:40.659,01:24:42.160,Go. Go.
01:24:44.538,01:24:46.206,"You did it, Derek."
01:24:46.206,01:24:47.708,I made a kite fly.
01:24:47.708,01:24:50.711,"Brennan, you're the best big brother ever!"
01:24:59.929,01:25:02.681,Floor mats. The ones that match the seats.
01:25:02.681,01:25:06.476,And I kind of wanted-- I traveled 500 miles to give you my seed.
01:25:06.476,01:25:08.186,Lumberjack.
01:25:49.061,01:25:51.396,"Rock the fuck out of those drums, Dale!"
01:25:51.396,01:25:52.898,I'm sorry.
01:26:30.102,01:26:31.854,DEREK: Yeah!
01:26:31.854,01:26:33.188,Yeah!
01:26:34.148,01:26:35.524,We're Prestige Worldwide!
01:26:35.524,01:26:36.984,Prestige Worldwide!
01:26:36.984,01:26:38.735,Fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:26:38.735,01:26:41.030,It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:26:41.030,01:26:44.158,It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:26:44.158,01:26:45.784,"ROBERT: Brennan, that was sublime."
01:26:45.784,01:26:48.328,Amazing. We are so proud of you both.
01:26:48.328,01:26:49.997,Thank you.
01:26:49.997,01:26:51.289,Thank you so much.
01:26:51.289,01:26:53.208,So I made my quota.
01:26:53.208,01:26:55.335,"Yeah, we sold a shit-ton of copters."
01:26:55.335,01:26:57.713,That's so good.
01:26:57.713,01:27:06.471,"Look, I-- I'm not great at this Hallmark stuff, but, uh, Brennan, when I look at you now, I-- I don't want to kick you in the head quite as much."
01:27:07.430,01:27:09.265,"Thanks, man."
01:27:09.265,01:27:10.934,That was beautiful.
01:27:10.934,01:27:12.686,Yeah.
01:27:12.686,01:27:14.479,Ha-ha. W-what-- What do we do now?
01:27:14.479,01:27:15.605,We could hug.
01:27:15.605,01:27:16.940,"You'd like that, faggot."
01:27:16.940,01:27:21.695,Sorry. I'm-- Okay.
01:27:34.666,01:27:36.877,It's okay.
01:27:50.348,01:27:52.142,That's what we've been looking for.
01:27:52.142,01:27:53.727,That's the ticket.
01:27:53.727,01:27:55.311,ROBERT: It's fantastic.
01:27:55.311,01:28:00.192,"We've never done anything like that before, so you can't expect it to be perfect."
01:28:00.192,01:28:02.318,DEREK: It felt good.
01:28:02.318,01:28:05.363,"Hello, Brennan. Hi."
01:28:06.740,01:28:09.367,"Robert, Mom, Derek."
01:28:09.367,01:28:10.869,"Oh, hi."
01:28:10.869,01:28:12.537,"Uh, actually, I'm his therapist."
01:28:12.537,01:28:14.497,We are in absolutely no way dating.
01:28:14.497,01:28:16.458,Right.
01:28:14.497,01:28:24.674,"DENISE: Brennan told me he was going to hurl his body off a helicopter into shark-infested waters, so I had a legal obligation to be here."
01:28:24.674,01:28:30.180,"I get it. Don't wanna appear too eager, and that is a good strategy too."
01:28:30.180,01:28:32.724,You are an enabler.
01:28:30.180,01:28:34.476,You think you're helping-- And you are a keeper.
01:28:34.476,01:28:35.978,What'd you think?
01:28:37.271,01:28:38.480,Brennan...
01:28:38.480,01:28:40.690,I thought you were incredibly brave.
01:28:42.067,01:28:52.786,"And I mean that in strictly the most clinical and professional sense possible, with no emotional, intimate, sexual, or any other undertones that you could possibly infer."
01:28:52.786,01:28:54.871,"God, you're gonna make me cry."
01:28:56.165,01:28:59.918,What poem is that from?
01:28:59.918,01:29:01.419,Alice.
01:29:02.712,01:29:04.798,I like making sex with you.
01:29:04.798,01:29:07.176,I do. But...
01:29:07.176,01:29:08.677,you're also married.
01:29:08.677,01:29:10.971,It's over.
01:29:10.971,01:29:12.347,This is crazy.
01:29:12.347,01:29:13.890,I'm-- I'm a mother.
01:29:12.347,01:29:16.018,"I have two children, I have a husband, a beautiful home."
01:29:16.018,01:29:17.519,I can't be fucking around with you.
01:29:17.519,01:29:19.313,"It was fun. It was fun, right?"
01:29:19.313,01:29:20.647,It was fun while it lasted.
01:29:20.647,01:29:22.774,"I'm glad. All right, well, good luck."
01:29:24.776,01:29:27.403,No.
01:29:28.864,01:29:30.448,Please don't leave me!
01:29:30.448,01:29:32.075,"Oh, my God."
01:29:32.075,01:29:33.743,Where?
01:29:36.746,01:29:38.123,Dale!
01:29:44.004,01:29:51.303,"So I was with Seal, and we were just taking a chopper up to, uh, Everest base camp, and, uh, the plot to my Sherpa-- Derek. Derek."
01:29:51.303,01:29:52.512,Shh. Shh.
01:29:52.512,01:29:54.306,We talked about this.
01:29:54.306,01:29:57.309,"Dale, Brennan. Tell me about the karaoke business."
01:29:57.309,01:30:00.603,"Really great, Dad. Yeah, we call it Karaoke 'n' Roll."
01:30:00.603,01:30:02.022,ROBERT: Oh.
01:30:00.603,01:30:04.358,"We got six bars, three restaurants, and two more wanna sign up."
01:30:04.358,01:30:05.650,So it's booming.
01:30:05.650,01:30:07.152,Fantastic.
01:30:05.650,01:30:08.695,"Most karaoke it's not, Open to everyone."
01:30:08.695,01:30:10.322,"Hey, just get up here and have fun."
01:30:10.322,01:30:12.866,"No. If you can't sing, just sit down. That's our motto."
01:30:12.866,01:30:14.284,It's-- It's the big leagues.
01:30:14.284,01:30:16.161,You guys are doing so great.
01:30:16.161,01:30:17.746,Guys...
01:30:17.746,01:30:20.249,I have a little Christmas surprise for Dale and Brennan.
01:30:21.208,01:30:22.251,You wanna see it?
01:30:22.251,01:30:24.044,Yes! Yes!
01:30:24.044,01:30:25.379,Let's go look at it! Come on.
01:30:25.379,01:30:27.130,Don't peek.
01:30:27.130,01:30:28.715,Don't peek.
01:30:28.715,01:30:30.050,Okay.
01:30:30.050,01:30:31.927,"DALE: Just a piñata, isn't it?"
01:30:31.927,01:30:34.012,ROBERT: Be patient. Be patient.
01:30:34.012,01:30:35.471,"DALE: Did you get me a tiger, Dad?"
01:30:35.471,01:30:36.806,"ROBERT: Okay, open your eyes."
01:30:36.806,01:30:38.141,Merry Christmas.
01:30:38.141,01:30:39.976,Holy shit!
01:30:39.976,01:30:43.313,DALE: Dad. I can't believe you put the boat in the tree!
01:30:43.313,01:30:44.564,This is amazing!
01:30:46.149,01:30:48.068,DALE: It's The Gilded Lady.
01:30:48.068,01:30:49.443,BRENNAN: Can't believe it.
01:30:49.443,01:30:50.987,How'd you get it up here?
01:30:50.987,01:30:54.116,"Oh, Robert. It's so great."
01:30:54.116,01:30:56.201,Pirate hats!
01:30:57.702,01:30:58.870,Whoa.
01:30:58.870,01:31:01.290,Hustlers!
01:31:01.290,01:31:03.625,Dad. That was so thoughtful.
01:31:05.585,01:31:07.212,Crossbows!
01:31:07.212,01:31:08.422,Ha-ha.
01:31:08.422,01:31:11.633,You guys finally came to your senses and got us something cool.
01:31:11.633,01:31:14.052,"You both know this is completely fucked up, right?"
01:31:14.052,01:31:15.845,Yeah. Mm.
01:31:15.845,01:31:19.975,But Brennan sure can wear the shit out of that pirate hat.
01:31:19.975,01:31:21.810,Chewbacca masks!
01:31:23.477,01:31:24.771,Whoo!
01:31:24.771,01:31:26.189,Chewbacca.
01:31:26.189,01:31:28.775,It's okay that mine's not movie-quality.
01:31:55.344,01:31:59.181,"But he's like, No, 'cause you drove my car last week, so I can't get it."
01:31:59.181,01:32:03.310,"So I'm like You're gonna buy it for me, or I'm gonna sock you in the mouth."
01:32:11.525,01:32:13.195,"Oh, shit."
01:32:19.451,01:32:23.288,"Well, if it isn't Dale Doback and his little butt buddy."
01:32:23.288,01:32:29.127,"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but I'm gonna kick you repeatedly in the balls, Gardocki!"
01:32:29.127,01:32:30.462,Let's get 'em!
01:33:19.928,01:33:21.679,The cops'll be here soon.
01:33:22.931,01:33:25.975,I guess this is what it feels like to be grown up.
01:33:25.975,01:33:27.894,Hey.
01:33:27.894,01:33:29.979,Can I ask you something?
01:33:29.979,01:33:31.481,"Yeah, of course."
01:33:31.481,01:33:33.275,You know back when you first moved in?
01:33:33.275,01:33:34.568,Yeah.
01:33:34.568,01:33:37.237,Did you touch my drum set?
01:33:37.237,01:33:39.613,"No, really, I won't get mad."
01:33:39.613,01:33:41.575,"No, I know. Yeah, you said you wouldn't get mad."
01:33:41.575,01:33:44.536,I'm saying I didn't do it.
01:33:44.536,01:33:46.496,Then I owe you an apology for attacking you.
01:33:46.496,01:33:47.914,"No, you don't at all. No."
01:33:47.914,01:33:50.833,"Well, why wouldn't you take an apology if you didn't do it?"
01:33:50.833,01:33:52.544,Just 'cause I'm cool.
01:37:34.516,01:37:35.849,You got my passport.
01:37:37.101,01:37:38.936,DALE: I'm good.
01:37:39.979,01:37:44.359,"DALE: All right. I don't want-- Don't worry, we're not gonna be late. Don't worry."
00:01:13.156,00:01:15.743,"Hey, Brennan."
00:01:15.784,00:01:19.120,"Mom, I'm watching the thing with the lady."
00:01:19.162,00:01:20.915,I'm leaving. Okay?
00:01:20.956,00:01:23.876,"Bye, Mom."
00:01:23.918,00:01:25.502,Let's slowly get those hips up.
00:01:33.260,00:01:34.762,Dale.
00:01:34.803,00:01:36.931,"Dale, I'm leaving for the conference."
00:01:36.972,00:01:38.223,"You leave me money for pizza, Dad?"
00:01:38.265,00:01:40.350,"Yeah, there's $20 on the hall table."
00:01:40.392,00:01:43.020,"Do not order pay-per-view, buddy."
00:01:43.062,00:01:45.564,But what if I want wings?
00:01:45.606,00:01:47.066,"That's not enough, Dad!"
00:01:47.106,00:01:56.116,"ROBERT: The RTI cochlear implant is the state-of-the-art implantable hearing device, due to its input processing of sound via the speech processor."
00:01:56.157,00:02:07.294,"But the most exciting new development is the external processor, which fits directly over the ear, which eliminates the need to put your face between those breasts."
00:02:10.130,00:02:14.134,I'm sorry.
00:02:16.971,00:02:20.015,"My name is Robert, and I play racquetball."
00:02:20.057,00:02:22.225,Sweet Jesus!
00:02:22.267,00:02:25.145,I am Nancy Huff.
00:02:22.267,00:02:29.399,"I know how to make tandoori chicken, I contribute to NPR every single year, and I love the movies of Rob Reiner."
00:02:29.441,00:02:31.902,Pilates changed my life.
00:02:31.944,00:02:34.780,"I have a boat, and I wanna retire and sail around the world."
00:02:34.822,00:02:38.033,Oh! I love the sea!
00:02:34.822,00:02:40.995,"And I drive a Mercedes, and I have a 40-year-old son, Dale, who still lives at home."
00:02:41.036,00:02:42.370,What did you just say?
00:02:42.412,00:02:44.289,"Oh, God. I knew I shouldn't have told you that."
00:02:44.331,00:02:48.460,I have a 39-year-old son named Brennan who still lives at home with me.
00:02:59.096,00:03:06.227,"I would like to thank all of you for being here with us on this fantastic, wonderful day."
00:03:06.269,00:03:09.606,"And, um, I would like to raise my glass."
00:03:09.648,00:03:13.192,Dale and I wanna welcome you to our home with open arms.
00:03:14.111,00:03:16.530,"Ugh! Get a room, Dad."
00:03:16.571,00:03:19.198,"ROBERT: Oh, for Chri... Dale!"
00:03:19.240,00:03:25.622,"Well, as you all know, my youngest son, Derek, couldn't be here because of an important fishing trip."
00:03:25.664,00:03:38.259,"But my other son, Brennan, was going to be moving into his own place, but, um, he was recently let go from his job at PetSmart, so he is gonna be living with us."
00:03:38.301,00:03:41.513,"I wasn't fired from my job, I was laid off!"
00:03:41.555,00:03:43.974,But you wouldn't know the difference.
00:03:44.016,00:03:48.145,I didn't want salmon!
00:03:51.606,00:03:53.233,This wedding is horseshit.
00:03:58.113,00:04:00.866,Somebody's awfully quiet back there.
00:04:01.867,00:04:04.161,I'm not gonna call him Dad.
00:04:04.203,00:04:06.246,"Brennan, you're 39 years old."
00:04:06.287,00:04:08.582,I would not expect you to call him Dad.
00:04:08.623,00:04:13.253,"Well, I'm not going to, ever."
00:04:14.379,00:04:19.676,"Robert better not get in my face, because I'll drop that motherfucker."
00:04:19.718,00:04:21.803,"Jesus, Brennan."
00:04:21.845,00:04:26.141,"I'm just saying, I think you gotta think about your options."
00:04:26.183,00:04:31.396,"I know that you are technically married now, but that does not mean that they have to live here."
00:04:33.565,00:04:37.778,"Dale, I think it's time for a change for both of us."
00:04:38.904,00:04:41.907,"Dad, we're men, okay?"
00:04:41.949,00:04:44.618,That means a few things.
00:04:44.659,00:04:48.496,We like to shit with the door open.
00:04:48.538,00:04:51.750,We go on riverboat-gambling trips.
00:04:51.792,00:04:54.920,That's what we do.
00:04:56.337,00:04:59.216,We literally have never done any of those things.
00:04:59.258,00:05:01.969,Where did he go to medical school?
00:05:02.010,00:05:04.429,He went to Northwestern and Johns Hopkins.
00:05:04.471,00:05:08.100,Is that good enough for you?
00:05:08.142,00:05:11.311,"Well, Brennan, those are very prestigious schools."
00:05:12.271,00:05:14.982,I smoked pot with Johnny Hopkins.
00:05:15.023,00:05:17.567,You don't know anyone named Johnny Hopkins.
00:05:17.609,00:05:23.531,"It was Johnny Hopkins and Sloan Kettering, and they were blazing that shit up every day."
00:05:23.573,00:05:27.494,"All right, here's a scenario for you, Dad."
00:05:27.535,00:05:32.916,Suppose Nancy sees me coming out of the shower and decides to come on to me.
00:05:32.958,00:05:39.006,I've got a luscious V of hair going from my chest pubes down to my ball-fro.
00:05:39.047,00:05:43.510,"And she takes one look at me and she goes, Oh, my God."
00:05:43.551,00:05:47.430,"I've had the old bull, now I want the young calf."
00:05:47.472,00:05:48.890,And she grabs me by the wiener.
00:05:48.932,00:05:50.475,Shut the fuck up!
00:06:03.780,00:06:05.907,"Come on, Brennan."
00:06:08.869,00:06:11.370,There you are.
00:06:11.412,00:06:13.248,"Oh, you look so cute in your moving clothes."
00:06:13.290,00:06:15.458,Aw.
00:06:15.500,00:06:17.836,It was easy.
00:06:20.922,00:06:22.507,Where's Brennan?
00:06:22.549,00:06:26.094,Um...
00:06:26.136,00:06:27.428,It was kind of a rough drive.
00:06:27.470,00:06:30.015,"Hey, Robert, what's all the commotion?"
00:06:30.057,00:06:32.809,"Hey, Don."
00:06:32.851,00:06:34.353,"Right here, Don."
00:06:34.393,00:06:36.313,Can I come over this afternoon and touch your face?
00:06:36.355,00:06:38.648,Sure.
00:06:38.690,00:06:40.108,"ROBERT: We'll see you, Don."
00:06:40.150,00:06:43.111,"DON: Let's go, Cinnamon."
00:06:44.154,00:06:45.446,Heel! Cinnamon!
00:06:47.782,00:06:48.867,Cinnamon!
00:06:49.368,00:06:50.911,"Hi, Dale."
00:06:50.952,00:06:53.663,"Hey, Nancy. Could you make me a grilled-cheese sandwich?"
00:06:53.705,00:06:55.456,Sure.
00:06:55.498,00:06:58.668,Dale just ate.
00:06:58.710,00:07:00.587,I see.
00:07:00.628,00:07:02.589,Look in your right hand.
00:07:02.630,00:07:04.216,NANCY: I sure don't mind a bit. I really don't.
00:07:04.258,00:07:07.052,"No, no. No, no. He's fine."
00:07:31.243,00:07:32.411,Hey.
00:07:33.120,00:07:34.621,Hey.
00:07:34.662,00:07:35.789,I'm Brennan.
00:07:36.456,00:07:38.333,I'm Dale.
00:07:38.375,00:07:39.876,But you have to call me Dragon.
00:07:41.795,00:07:43.463,You have to call me Nighthawk.
00:08:04.276,00:08:05.568,Brennan.
00:08:05.610,00:08:07.612,Ahhh!
00:08:07.654,00:08:08.655,Please don't do that.
00:08:16.663,00:08:18.706,"Now, that's enough ketchup."
00:08:21.251,00:08:23.253,I like it.
00:08:23.295,00:08:25.213,"So what have you been working on recently, Dale?"
00:08:26.173,00:08:27.466,Well...
00:08:28.758,00:08:30.260,I manage a baseball team.
00:08:31.552,00:08:34.097,NANCY: Little League?
00:08:43.190,00:08:45.150,Why don't you take a picture?
00:08:45.192,00:08:48.278,"Why don't you stop being so confrontational, Dale?"
00:08:48.320,00:08:50.530,I'm not the one staring at me.
00:08:50.571,00:08:52.573,"ROBERT: So, Brennan, how about you?"
00:08:52.615,00:08:56.828,I know you used to work at PetSmart. Mmm?
00:08:56.870,00:08:59.414,"That's right, Mr. Doback."
00:09:00.290,00:09:02.792,"That's right, Robin."
00:09:03.335,00:09:05.879,Robin.
00:09:05.920,00:09:10.384,"Actually, Brennan is a really talented person."
00:09:10.425,00:09:13.094,He's a very gifted singer.
00:09:13.136,00:09:15.013,"I'm really, really good."
00:09:17.015,00:09:22.770,I've been called the songbird of my generation by people who've heard me.
00:09:22.812,00:09:23.938,That good.
00:09:23.980,00:09:32.072,"NANCY: The only trick is, is that Brennan's very about who he sings in front of, so, uh..."
00:09:32.113,00:09:35.700,"I'm his mom, for example, I've only heard him sing twice."
00:09:35.742,00:09:38.328,"That's funny that you say that, because I can sing, too."
00:09:38.370,00:09:40.288,"In fact, I'll sing right now."
00:09:40.330,00:09:45.835,On these hairy balls Hey! Hey!
00:09:45.877,00:09:49.130,Right up in here ROBERT: Stop it!
00:09:50.590,00:09:53.093,"Stop it, Dale!"
00:09:53.134,00:09:54.594,That's cute.
00:09:54.635,00:09:56.846,I remember when I had my first beer.
00:09:56.888,00:10:01.518,"Ha-ha. That's so funny, the last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur."
00:10:01.560,00:10:03.853,ROBERT: Stop right now.
00:10:05.146,00:10:08.233,"All right. Brennan, it's okay. It's okay."
00:10:08.275,00:10:10.068,"Hey, hey."
00:10:10.110,00:10:12.070,"Great, Dale."
00:10:12.112,00:10:15.240,"All right, just... Look, you know what? Hey, guys."
00:10:15.282,00:10:17.242,"Okay, sleeping arrangements."
00:10:17.284,00:10:26.585,"It's gonna be different, but, um, because Dale refuses to give up his office drum set, um, uh, that means that, Brennan, you and Dale are gonna have to share a room."
00:10:26.626,00:10:28.253,But it's just temporary.
00:10:28.295,00:10:33.383,"I... Well, it's gonna be an exciting adventure."
00:10:33.425,00:10:37.137,"You wanna show him the room, Dale? Show him where he can put his stuff?"
00:10:38.430,00:10:39.722,"NANCY: That's nice, thank you."
00:10:40.474,00:10:42.434,"Good night, Nancy."
00:10:42.476,00:10:50.024,"Hey, listen, um, I like to have a lot of fresh fruit around and chocolate chips in my pancakes. Okay?"
00:10:50.066,00:10:52.444,Write it down so you don't forget.
00:10:52.486,00:10:55.322,"She's Mom now, so..."
00:10:55.363,00:10:57.031,"Good night, Mom."
00:10:58.699,00:11:01.828,"Good night, Mr. Doback."
00:11:10.044,00:11:13.256,So just a few basic rules about the house.
00:11:13.298,00:11:18.553,"If there's any foods that you like, I suggest you put your name on them, or they will be thrown out."
00:11:18.928,00:11:20.763,By me.
00:11:20.805,00:11:24.434,"Uh, house was built in 1825 by General Custer."
00:11:24.476,00:11:26.394,I wanna show you this room.
00:11:26.436,00:11:29.981,"Um, hold up. Ho, ho!"
00:11:30.023,00:11:31.983,You see this room?
00:11:32.025,00:11:34.777,"Okay, here's the deal."
00:11:34.819,00:11:38.198,This is my office and my beat laboratory.
00:11:38.239,00:11:40.033,Okay?
00:11:40.074,00:11:42.285,And this is the one rule of the house.
00:11:42.327,00:11:48.707,"Don't ever, ever, ever touch my drum set."
00:11:48.749,00:11:50.502,You understand?
00:11:50.544,00:11:53.046,No touching!
00:11:53.087,00:11:55.423,There. I was at about six there.
00:11:55.465,00:11:57.634,You don't wanna see me go to 10.
00:11:57.676,00:11:59.718,Get your shit.
00:12:08.186,00:12:09.187,ROBERT: Honey?
00:12:09.229,00:12:10.605,NANCY: Hm?
00:12:10.647,00:12:14.108,I think I just found a chain of islands that we can sail to after New Zealand.
00:12:14.150,00:12:16.695,That's wonderful.
00:12:16.735,00:12:20.739,"You know, I've been meaning to ask you, um..."
00:12:24.703,00:12:27.955,Why is it that Dale never left?
00:12:30.375,00:12:33.878,"Well, Dale has always coasted off my accomplishments."
00:12:33.920,00:12:39.008,"I mean, he left college his junior year because he said he wanted to join the family business."
00:12:39.050,00:12:41.302,But you're a medical doctor.
00:12:41.344,00:12:43.137,"Believe me, I've told him that."
00:12:43.179,00:12:46.516,"But he just always says, It's all about who you know."
00:12:46.558,00:12:49.227,"I mean, I don't know where he got this sense of entitlement."
00:12:49.269,00:12:51.187,Maybe it was his mother passing.
00:12:51.229,00:12:54.065,What about Brennan?
00:12:51.229,00:12:56.735,"I mean, from what you've told me, his younger brother Derek's been quite successful."
00:12:56.775,00:13:01.364,"Well, certainly when his father and I split, that was difficult for him."
00:13:01.406,00:13:08.663,"And this one time, when Brennan was 17 and Derek was 14, and Brennan decided to enter a talent show."
00:13:10.081,00:13:14.377,He sang a song from an old pirate musical.
00:13:14.419,00:13:21.259,"But Derek got his football buddies to replace the choir and sing, Brennan has a mangina."
00:13:24.929,00:13:31.436,"Finally, the audience and even some of the nastier parents started singing."
00:13:31.478,00:13:34.355,Brennan has a mangina.
00:13:34.397,00:13:38.192,"And I have to admit, for a little while, I sort of joined in as well."
00:13:38.234,00:13:42.196,"From that day on, Brennan never sang again."
00:13:42.238,00:13:46.284,Derek went on to win the contest by lip-synching Ice Ice Baby.
00:13:50.997,00:13:53.166,"Oh, that's a great song. Mmm."
00:13:54.668,00:13:58.463,"Hey, you awake?"
00:13:58.505,00:14:00.131,Yeah.
00:14:03.217,00:14:06.053,I just want you to know I hate you.
00:14:06.095,00:14:08.055,So does my dad.
00:14:09.390,00:14:11.434,"Well, that's fine."
00:14:12.769,00:14:14.521,Because guess what.
00:14:14.562,00:14:17.190,"I hate you, too."
00:14:17.231,00:14:20.694,And this house sucks ass.
00:14:20.735,00:14:29.494,"Well, the only reason you're living here is because me and my dad decided that your mom was really hot and maybe we should just both bang her."
00:14:29.536,00:14:32.246,And we'll put up with the retard in the meantime.
00:14:32.288,00:14:34.999,Who's the retard?
00:14:35.041,00:14:36.292,"Hey, y'all don't say that."
00:14:36.334,00:14:38.044,Shut up.
00:14:38.085,00:14:39.754,You'll wake up my dad and get me grounded.
00:14:40.380,00:14:42.173,Just shut up.
00:14:42.215,00:14:45.259,You and your mom are hillbillies.
00:14:45.301,00:14:47.595,This is a house of learned doctors.
00:14:47.637,00:14:50.473,You're not a doctor.
00:14:50.515,00:14:52.892,"You're a big, fat, curly-headed fuck."
00:14:53.768,00:14:56.604,"Oh, yeah?"
00:14:56.646,00:14:58.648,I'm a curly-headed fuck?
00:14:58.690,00:15:01.401,You better not go to sleep.
00:15:01.442,00:15:04.404,"As soon as your eyes shut, I'm gonna punch you square in the face."
00:15:04.445,00:15:10.326,"I hope you stay still when you sleep, because I'm putting a rat trap between your legs."
00:15:10.368,00:15:15.915,I'm gonna take a pillowcase and fill it full of bars of soap and beat the shit out of you.
00:15:19.878,00:15:22.422,I want you out of my fucking house.
00:15:22.463,00:15:25.592,"No way, kemosabe."
00:15:25.633,00:15:28.261,This is my house now.
00:15:31.097,00:15:33.349,ROBERT: How do you like The Gilded Lady?
00:15:33.391,00:15:35.393,Mmm. I wish we could retire right now.
00:15:35.435,00:15:37.311,Won't be long.
00:15:47.781,00:15:50.157,"Oh, God! It's cold!"
00:15:51.576,00:15:54.495,Hey! Is anyone listening? Help!
00:16:40.708,00:16:43.336,"Fuck you, Dale! Fuck you!"
00:16:43.377,00:16:45.588,MAN OVER TV: ...obviously you guys are hot.
00:16:45.630,00:16:48.508,Just revealed her cover.
00:16:48.549,00:16:51.302,A little girl-on-girl.
00:16:54.388,00:16:56.474,Hey.
00:16:58.977,00:17:02.563,Why you so sweaty?
00:17:02.605,00:17:04.398,Not supposed to have your feet on the couch.
00:17:28.464,00:17:30.800,"Hey, man."
00:17:30.842,00:17:32.092,Did you touch my drum set?
00:17:33.845,00:17:35.972,Nope.
00:17:33.845,00:17:41.561,It's just weird because seems like someone definitely touched my drum set.
00:17:41.602,00:17:45.023,"Yeah, that is weird."
00:17:45.105,00:17:48.275,Hey!
00:17:53.447,00:17:54.991,"You fucking crazy, man?"
00:17:55.033,00:17:58.995,"You sound insane, do you realize that?"
00:17:59.037,00:18:01.789,"Fuck you, Brennan."
00:18:01.831,00:18:04.042,And I wanna hear that dirty little mouth admit it.
00:18:04.083,00:18:06.544,"You get out of my face, or I'm gonna roundhouse your ass."
00:18:06.586,00:18:09.213,You swear on your mom's life that you didn't touch it then!
00:18:09.255,00:18:10.548,I don't have to swear to shit.
00:18:10.590,00:18:14.260,"That's because you fucking touched my drum set, because I know Cops doesn't start till 4:00."
00:18:17.889,00:18:19.306,Where are you going?
00:18:19.348,00:18:21.559,I'm going upstairs.
00:18:21.601,00:18:25.063,Because I'm gonna put my nut sack on your drum set. Okay?
00:18:25.104,00:18:26.188,Don't you do that.
00:18:26.230,00:18:33.320,"I am warning you right now, if you touch my drums, I will stab you in the neck with a knife!"
00:18:33.362,00:18:38.117,"If you even go in the room, I swear to God!"
00:18:38.158,00:18:40.036,Don't wanna miss a spot.
00:18:40.078,00:18:41.495,John Bonham's playing Moby Dick for real!
00:18:41.537,00:18:43.706,I swear to God.
00:18:54.133,00:18:55.843,I warned you.
00:18:55.885,00:18:58.805,"There's one rule in the house, and you broke it!"
00:19:01.390,00:19:02.224,Ow!
00:19:02.892,00:19:04.978,Aah!
00:19:09.065,00:19:10.566,I didn't touch your damn drum set!
00:19:14.612,00:19:15.780,I'm pre-diabetic!
00:19:21.452,00:19:24.538,...kill you.
00:19:32.839,00:19:36.134,I'll kill you!
00:19:36.801,00:19:39.053,Your drum set's a whore!
00:19:39.095,00:19:41.388,I teabagged your fucking drum set!
00:19:41.430,00:19:44.809,"Well, my drum set's a guy, so that makes you gay, you fucker."
00:19:44.851,00:19:46.393,I'll kill you!
00:19:48.146,00:19:50.023,"No, a story has a..."
00:19:50.064,00:19:53.109,"Dr. Doback, the phone's for you. I think it's urgent."
00:19:53.151,00:19:54.861,Hello?
00:19:54.902,00:19:56.320,I can't stop them!
00:19:56.362,00:19:59.157,"Please, stop screaming."
00:19:59.198,00:20:03.285,"There seems to be some savage fight going on between my son and stepson, so I..."
00:20:04.328,00:20:08.290,BRENNAN: Rape! Rape! Rape!
00:20:11.794,00:20:13.253,What's going on?
00:20:13.295,00:20:15.631,Robert! They won't...
00:20:15.673,00:20:16.799,NANCY: Stop it! Stop it!
00:20:16.841,00:20:18.009,"ROBERT: Dale, what..."
00:20:18.051,00:20:19.844,"DALE: Stay out of it, Dad!"
00:20:28.227,00:20:30.688,What the fucking fuck?
00:20:32.481,00:20:34.233,Aww!
00:20:34.984,00:20:37.862,Someone got some air. Snap.
00:20:37.904,00:20:39.279,I still hate you.
00:20:40.280,00:20:41.908,BRENNAN: Such power. It's raw power.
00:20:41.949,00:20:43.826,"Dad, what are you doing?"
00:20:43.868,00:20:49.040,"Okay, here's the deal, number one, you will fix the fucking drywall now."
00:20:49.082,00:20:52.585,"Number two, you have one month to find jobs or you're out on your asses."
00:20:52.626,00:20:55.588,"I will arrange interviews for Monday, and you will go!"
00:20:55.629,00:20:59.299,"Dad, why are you talking to me like this? I'm your son."
00:20:59.341,00:21:01.468,I'm not buying that crap anymore.
00:21:01.510,00:21:05.014,Today I saw my own son use a bicycle as a weapon.
00:21:05.056,00:21:07.892,You yelled rape at the top of your lungs.
00:21:07.934,00:21:12.479,"Mom, I honestly thought I was gonna be raped for a second."
00:21:12.521,00:21:15.108,He had the craziest look in his eyes.
00:21:15.149,00:21:18.027,"And at one point he said, Let's get it on."
00:21:18.069,00:21:21.030,That was about the fighting.
00:21:21.072,00:21:22.990,"BRENNAN: Look, I didn't touch your drum set, okay?"
00:21:23.032,00:21:28.204,I witnessed with my eyes your testicles touching my drum set.
00:21:28.246,00:21:30.873,"All right, that's it!"
00:21:30.915,00:21:33.167,You two guys leave me no choice.
00:21:33.209,00:21:34.710,No television for a week.
00:21:34.752,00:21:36.087,What!
00:21:36.129,00:21:38.923,"We are so serious, guys."
00:21:38.965,00:21:40.591,DALE: Are you out of your mind?
00:21:40.633,00:21:42.676,This goes in Robert's wall safe and it's gonna stay there.
00:21:42.718,00:21:44.804,No!
00:21:44.845,00:21:48.724,This house is a fucking prison!
00:21:48.766,00:21:51.727,In the galaxy of This Sucks Camel Dicks!
00:22:22.466,00:22:25.343,Hi! Aunt Carol.
00:22:26.929,00:22:28.597,Hey.
00:22:28.639,00:22:30.683,You can't catch me.
00:22:34.478,00:22:36.856,Ah! I gotcha.
00:22:36.897,00:22:38.482,I gotcha.
00:22:43.779,00:22:46.364,Ah! Aunt Carol's on fire!
00:23:03.381,00:23:05.176,"ROBERT: I don't know where you learned it, but I'm still sore."
00:23:05.218,00:23:06.677,"Well, there's lots more where that..."
00:23:06.719,00:23:07.887,My God.
00:23:07.928,00:23:09.305,"Oh, no."
00:23:09.347,00:23:11.473,What happened?
00:23:11.974,00:23:14.727,"Oh, my God."
00:23:14.768,00:23:16.770,ROBERT: Maybe Dale left the back door open and raccoons got in.
00:23:16.812,00:23:18.064,"Oh, my God."
00:23:18.105,00:23:20.941,Nancy? Is this your purse in the freezer?
00:23:20.983,00:23:23.819,Yes. It's Brennan.
00:23:23.861,00:23:27.365,He sleepwalks and he always puts my purse in the freezer.
00:23:27.405,00:23:29.158,"Dale sleepwalks, too."
00:23:29.200,00:23:31.451,Are you kidding me?
00:23:32.953,00:23:34.454,What's in the...
00:23:34.496,00:23:35.789,Couch pillows?
00:23:35.831,00:23:37.708,"Yeah, Dale."
00:23:39.417,00:23:41.212,Come on.
00:23:41.254,00:23:43.881,It's okay.
00:23:43.923,00:23:45.299,It's gonna be fine.
00:23:45.341,00:23:48.552,"They're gonna get jobs, they'll be gone in a month."
00:23:55.475,00:23:56.434,Guys.
00:23:58.896,00:24:01.857,Guys. Guys!
00:24:01.899,00:24:04.568,The clown has no penis.
00:24:04.610,00:24:06.737,What kind of dreams are you guys having?
00:24:06.779,00:24:08.781,"Hey, it's 12:30."
00:24:08.822,00:24:11.449,"Brennan, your brother's coming today, so you might wanna get up."
00:24:11.491,00:24:12.952,BRENNAN: Today?
00:24:12.993,00:24:16.663,Shit.
00:24:16.705,00:24:19.875,My little brother's even a bigger asshole than you are.
00:24:19.917,00:24:21.210,"DEREK: All right, gang, let's really nail it this time."
00:24:21.252,00:24:22.544,Here we go.
00:24:22.586,00:24:26.006,"A one, a two, a one, two, three, four."
00:24:46.277,00:24:47.611,"All right, Tommy, you're the oldest."
00:24:47.653,00:24:49.487,I'm counting on you.
00:25:01.875,00:25:04.502,"Nice vibrato, buddy."
00:25:07.006,00:25:09.300,Flat. It's so flat.
00:25:09.342,00:25:10.759,I can't even...
00:25:10.801,00:25:12.470,You don't even look good while you're singing.
00:25:12.510,00:25:14.347,The worst thing I've ever heard.
00:25:14.388,00:25:17.641,"This is $1200 a week for voice lessons, and this is what I get?"
00:25:17.683,00:25:19.477,"Okay, I'm gonna save it with this solo."
00:25:23.063,00:25:35.742,high like this Jesus!
00:25:50.757,00:25:53.927,We were so sad you guys couldn't come to the wedding.
00:25:53.969,00:25:55.721,ROBERT: But we completely understand.
00:25:55.762,00:25:57.806,You were busy fishing with Mark Cuban.
00:25:57.848,00:26:00.184,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:25:57.848,00:26:03.854,"Well, not just the Cubes, but we had Chris Daughtry, Jeff Probst, super-chef Bobby Flay."
00:26:03.896,00:26:05.814,"I mean, it was insane."
00:26:05.856,00:26:07.565,"My God, that's impressive."
00:26:07.607,00:26:09.860,"DEREK: Yeah, we were down in southern part of the Gulf, fishing bonito."
00:26:09.902,00:26:12.905,"Robert, have you ever been down to the southern part of the Gulf on the bonito run?"
00:26:12.946,00:26:14.990,Always wanted to.
00:26:15.032,00:26:17.535,It is. It's gorgeous.
00:26:18.744,00:26:20.079,Uh... What?
00:26:20.120,00:26:22.331,"Dale, don't interrupt the man when he's telling a story."
00:26:22.373,00:26:25.167,"No, no, no. It's fine, Robert."
00:26:25.209,00:26:28.087,What's this guy's deal?
00:26:28.128,00:26:31.882,"Well, Dale, they are what's called a trophy fish."
00:26:31.924,00:26:35.928,"So, yeah, they're pretty big."
00:26:35.969,00:26:37.137,I'm... I'm sorry.
00:26:39.056,00:26:42.268,"Um, anyway..."
00:26:42.309,00:26:44.895,"Oh, God, I'm sorry, now I forget where my story was going."
00:26:44.937,00:26:46.272,"Ah, damn it, Dale!"
00:26:46.313,00:26:47.689,DEREK: No...
00:26:47.731,00:26:48.941,What?
00:26:48.982,00:26:51.902,"No, he can join in, Robert."
00:26:51.944,00:26:54.196,"Well, I asked him twice not to interrupt."
00:26:54.238,00:26:57.908,"Listen, gang, don't be mad at Dale for ruining the story."
00:26:57.950,00:27:00.202,It's totally fine.
00:27:00.244,00:27:03.956,"Derek, that you do."
00:27:03.997,00:27:08.210,Guilty as charged with the stories.
00:27:08.252,00:27:11.171,"Ah, come on."
00:27:11.213,00:27:14.258,"From across the room, I feel like we have a thing."
00:27:14.300,00:27:16.969,"You and me, man."
00:27:18.678,00:27:21.223,I never heard that laugh before.
00:27:21.265,00:27:22.891,"Dad, why are you acting so weird?"
00:27:22.933,00:27:25.018,"Oh, hey, by the way, guys, where's my bro, Brennan?"
00:27:33.360,00:27:36.863,You're right about your brother. Total dick.
00:27:38.031,00:27:39.657,Told you.
00:27:39.699,00:27:41.535,You know what?
00:27:39.699,00:27:44.413,"I still hate you, but you got a pretty awesome collection of nudie mags."
00:27:44.455,00:27:46.706,"Yeah, I got them from the '70s, '80s and '90s."
00:27:47.958,00:27:51.086,It's like masturbating in a time machine.
00:27:51.128,00:27:54.840,"Anyway, so I figure by the summer of 2010, we can probably set sail."
00:27:54.881,00:27:56.925,But I think about it every day of my life.
00:27:56.967,00:28:00.304,"Yeah. Let me ask you this, Bob, why wait two years?"
00:28:00.346,00:28:02.348,"Well, I gotta make more money."
00:28:02.389,00:28:04.099,"I hear you, believe me."
00:28:04.141,00:28:08.770,But what if I were to tell you that I could sell this house for 30 percent above market right now?
00:28:08.812,00:28:11.315,That'd be great.
00:28:11.357,00:28:12.566,"Yeah. In a heartbeat, Robby."
00:28:12.608,00:28:15.986,"Look, I got my real-estate license a few years back for shits and gigs."
00:28:16.028,00:28:20.324,"You know, I'd even do it for four-fifths commish, because you know what really gets my dick hard?"
00:28:20.366,00:28:21.741,Helping out my friends.
00:28:21.783,00:28:22.993,That'd be fantastic.
00:28:23.035,00:28:24.702,"That'd be fanta... Oh, my God."
00:28:24.744,00:28:27.122,"No, it would be kick-ass, bro."
00:28:27.164,00:28:28.415,Right there.
00:28:30.543,00:28:32.211,What about Dale and Brennan?
00:28:32.252,00:28:34.296,Because they haven't even gotten jobs yet.
00:28:34.338,00:28:36.256,"God, change the record."
00:28:37.090,00:28:40.302,Sweet! Ooh!
00:28:40.344,00:28:44.056,Robert. Don't talk to me like that in front of my son.
00:28:44.097,00:28:47.434,"Oh, come on. We're talking about our dream, the boat."
00:28:47.476,00:28:51.271,"Yeah, it's our dream, but I think it all needs to be done in good time."
00:28:51.313,00:28:53.691,"I'm just saying give it some thought, okay?"
00:28:53.732,00:28:55.067,That's it. That's all I'm saying.
00:28:55.108,00:28:58.904,"Holy shit, triplets."
00:28:58.945,00:29:01.240,"It's true, three's..."
00:29:01.281,00:29:03.325,It shows tons of bush.
00:29:03.367,00:29:05.827,Careful with that.
00:29:05.869,00:29:07.246,"No, I'm not."
00:29:07.287,00:29:09.081,It's worth a lot of money.
00:29:09.122,00:29:10.583,"What's up, faggots?"
00:29:10.624,00:29:12.585,"What's up, man?"
00:29:12.626,00:29:13.711,"What's up with that, dipshit?"
00:29:13.752,00:29:14.878,"Hi, Derek."
00:29:14.920,00:29:17.423,"Whoa, calm down, man."
00:29:17.464,00:29:21.176,"Wow. You guys, I really like your guys' setup up here."
00:29:21.218,00:29:23.220,"What is your problem, man?"
00:29:23.262,00:29:26.765,"My problem? Oh, I don't know."
00:29:26.806,00:29:28.767,"Actually, I have the opposite of a problem."
00:29:28.808,00:29:31.729,I made over 550 K last year.
00:29:31.770,00:29:34.273,It's not about money.
00:29:34.314,00:29:38.902,"Well, for me, it's a little bit about money, and I made that much money last year."
00:29:38.944,00:29:44.199,I am the VP of the biggest executive-helicopter-leasing company on the western seaboard.
00:29:44.241,00:29:48.120,Okay? I haven't had a carb since 2004.
00:29:48.161,00:29:50.830,Check these out. See these?
00:29:50.872,00:29:52.332,This is what I live with.
00:29:52.374,00:29:55.001,Every day I lather this up with Kiehl's in the shower.
00:29:55.043,00:29:56.420,You wanna touch this shit?
00:29:56.462,00:29:57.463,You wanna touch these bad boys?
00:29:58.464,00:30:00.215,"Sorry, not gonna happen."
00:30:00.257,00:30:01.759,Is there something you want?
00:30:01.800,00:30:04.010,"Look, I promised Mom I'd offer you a job."
00:30:04.052,00:30:06.805,"I told her it'd count as her Christmas present, so..."
00:30:06.846,00:30:08.807,No. I'm never gonna work for you.
00:30:08.848,00:30:10.392,Fine. I don't care.
00:30:10.434,00:30:16.064,"The truth is I just smoked a J out in my car a few minutes ago, so feeling a little spacey."
00:30:16.106,00:30:18.651,Know what I'm saying?
00:30:18.692,00:30:20.193,"What you looking at, kemosabe?"
00:30:20.235,00:30:22.070,You...
00:30:22.112,00:30:24.990,You wanna punch me right now.
00:30:25.031,00:30:28.661,"You wanna punch me right now, but you won't."
00:30:28.702,00:30:30.203,"You wanna punch me, too, Brennan?"
00:30:30.245,00:30:32.998,You guys both look like you might wanna hit me in the face.
00:30:33.039,00:30:35.334,"You do, I can tell."
00:30:35.375,00:30:36.835,Why don't you punch me in the face?
00:30:36.876,00:30:38.712,Punch me in the fucking face!
00:30:41.256,00:30:43.049,Ooh. Aah! Oh!
00:30:43.509,00:30:45.427,Ah!
00:30:45.469,00:30:48.138,"Oh, shit."
00:30:48.180,00:30:49.306,That was awesome.
00:30:49.348,00:30:51.767,Mom! Mom!
00:30:51.809,00:30:54.227,"Hey, Derek, you know what's always good for shoulder pain?"
00:30:54.269,00:30:56.522,DEREK: What?
00:30:56.563,00:30:58.023,Snap!
00:31:00.275,00:31:02.444,"Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Bobby."
00:31:02.486,00:31:05.447,"Aside from that retard trying to punch me, it was actually a pretty good evening."
00:31:05.489,00:31:09.075,"It was our pleasure, son."
00:31:09.117,00:31:10.661,"Oh, don't, don't."
00:31:10.703,00:31:13.246,"Bye, kids."
00:31:13.288,00:31:14.581,Excuse me.
00:31:14.623,00:31:18.460,Hi.
00:31:18.502,00:31:21.921,"Uh, is it true you struck Derek in the face and he fell from the tree house?"
00:31:21.963,00:31:23.632,Yeah. He asked me to.
00:31:23.674,00:31:26.092,"Oh, that's the most amazing thing I've ever heard."
00:31:26.134,00:31:31.473,"Um, I want you to know that tonight I am going to pleasure myself to the image of you doing that to Derek."
00:31:31.515,00:31:33.266,You know what I mean?
00:31:33.308,00:31:34.976,Masturbate.
00:31:35.018,00:31:36.019,I am.
00:31:36.978,00:31:38.522,"Oh, Dale."
00:31:38.564,00:31:40.524,You are something.
00:31:41.316,00:31:43.610,You are something.
00:31:45.111,00:31:46.697,"You're something, too."
00:31:46.739,00:31:51.159,I wanna roll you into a little ball and shove you up my vagina.
00:31:51.201,00:31:55.247,You could just live there.
00:31:55.288,00:31:56.623,In your vagina?
00:31:56.665,00:32:06.341,I wanna walk around with you in there and just know that whenever I feel a little tickle or scratch that it's just your hair up my vagina.
00:32:06.383,00:32:08.427,"Please, just do it for me."
00:32:08.468,00:32:09.928,What's happening?
00:32:12.222,00:32:13.932,Kiss me.
00:32:17.477,00:32:20.397,I know. I know. It's too much.
00:32:20.939,00:32:22.649,It's too much.
00:32:26.278,00:32:29.197,"I hate my life, Dale."
00:32:29.239,00:32:32.618,"Dale, I hate my life!"
00:32:32.659,00:32:34.703,"Well, you seemed okay at the di..."
00:32:34.745,00:32:37.122,"DEREK: Alice! Honey, come on!"
00:32:37.163,00:32:40.667,"Dane Cook, pay-per-view, 20 minutes. Let's go!"
00:32:40.709,00:32:44.212,"Coming, honey! I'm just..."
00:32:44.254,00:32:46.256,This is so stupid.
00:32:47.633,00:32:49.301,Call me.
00:32:49.342,00:32:50.636,I love you.
00:32:50.677,00:32:52.387,Okay.
00:32:58.685,00:33:01.563,Hey. What'd she want?
00:33:01.605,00:33:04.023,Nothing. Who's... Who?
00:33:06.109,00:33:07.527,Alice.
00:33:07.569,00:33:11.114,We were just talking. Not...
00:33:12.365,00:33:14.868,I can't believe you hit Derek.
00:33:14.910,00:33:16.620,I know. Did you see the expression on his face?
00:33:16.662,00:33:18.872,Yeah.
00:33:18.914,00:33:19.998,Listen.
00:33:21.040,00:33:24.127,I know that we started out as foe.
00:33:24.169,00:33:35.681,"But after that courageous act that you showed me against the one they call Derek, maybe someday we could become friends."
00:33:35.722,00:33:43.730,"Friends who ride majestic, translucent steeds, shooting flaming arrows across the Bridge of Hemdale."
00:33:43.772,00:33:47.526,"I would follow you into the mists of Avalon, if that's what you mean."
00:33:47.567,00:33:50.278,Do you wanna see something super-cool that only three people have ever seen in their lifetime?
00:33:54.867,00:33:58.328,"Okay, open your eyes."
00:33:58.370,00:34:00.539,See that black smudge right there on the blade?
00:34:00.580,00:34:02.666,Yeah.
00:34:02.708,00:34:05.251,Pretty recognizable signature.
00:34:05.293,00:34:07.921,Randy Jackson from American Idol.
00:34:07.963,00:34:11.383,Why do you have Randy Jackson's autograph on a martial-arts weapon?
00:34:11.424,00:34:17.055,"Because I bumped into him and all I had on me was this samurai sword, and you're not gonna not get Randy Jackson's autograph, right?"
00:34:17.096,00:34:19.057,I would've done the exact same thing.
00:34:20.517,00:34:23.436,"Now, do you wanna see something really cool?"
00:34:23.478,00:34:25.397,Of course.
00:34:28.107,00:34:31.403,Industrial-strength night-vision goggles.
00:34:31.444,00:34:34.197,Holy Santa Claus shit.
00:34:34.239,00:34:36.575,Can you imagine if we had these when we were 12?
00:34:36.616,00:34:39.703,Even better.
00:34:39.745,00:34:43.707,You know what's amazing?
00:34:43.749,00:34:45.709,Right?
00:34:45.751,00:34:47.168,Aah! Aah!
00:34:47.210,00:34:55.134,I can't believe I've been living here for two weeks and I'm walking around this place thinking I've got a huge doucher for a stepbrother.
00:34:55.176,00:34:57.888,"Secretly, you're not a doucher."
00:34:57.930,00:34:59.973,"Let's play a game, all right?"
00:35:00.015,00:35:02.475,"On the count of three, name your favorite dinosaur."
00:35:02.517,00:35:05.771,"Don't even think about it, just name it. Ready?"
00:35:05.812,00:35:08.147,Velociraptor.
00:35:08.189,00:35:11.443,Favorite non-pornographic magazine to masturbate to.
00:35:11.484,00:35:14.404,Good Housekeeping.
00:35:14.446,00:35:16.865,"If you were a chick, who's the one guy you'd sleep with?"
00:35:16.907,00:35:18.867,John Stamos.
00:35:18.909,00:35:20.577,What?
00:35:20.619,00:35:22.788,Yep.
00:35:22.829,00:35:24.330,Do you wanna go do karate in the garage?
00:35:24.372,00:35:26.041,Yup!
00:35:36.342,00:35:38.804,Nighthawk!
00:35:45.644,00:35:47.228,Yeah!
00:35:52.525,00:35:55.112,I think they're starting to like each other.
00:35:55.153,00:35:56.989,I got a really bad feeling about this.
00:35:58.824,00:36:00.450,Sword fight!
00:36:00.492,00:36:01.326,Sword fight!
00:36:05.914,00:36:08.416,Exactly the same!
00:36:12.504,00:36:13.421,Now you're in trouble.
00:36:15.757,00:36:17.009,Come on!
00:36:17.050,00:36:18.969,"They're betting against you, but you can do it!"
00:36:20.679,00:36:21.763,Yeah!
00:36:23.765,00:36:24.850,Is this a bad time?
00:36:24.891,00:36:26.351,What the hell's going on?
00:36:26.392,00:36:29.729,"Ma, Mr. Doback, okay, Dale and I were just..."
00:36:29.771,00:36:31.314,"Please, stop calling me Mr. Doback."
00:36:31.356,00:36:32.983,Sorry. Okay.
00:36:33.025,00:36:38.697,"Mom, Doback, we think it would be very prudent..."
00:36:38.738,00:36:41.741,Can we turn our beds into bunk beds?
00:36:41.783,00:36:43.702,Why are you guys so sweaty?
00:36:43.743,00:36:46.663,"All right, we've already figured out how to do this."
00:36:46.705,00:36:49.749,And here's the thing. It would give us so much extra space in our room to do activities.
00:36:49.791,00:36:51.209,Please say yes.
00:36:51.250,00:36:53.294,You don't need permission from us to build bunk beds.
00:36:53.336,00:36:55.630,You're adults.
00:36:55.672,00:36:57.090,So...
00:36:59.092,00:37:01.553,I'm not making myself clear.
00:37:01.594,00:37:04.389,I don't give a fuck.
00:37:04.430,00:37:06.808,"Now, you both have several interviews tomorrow."
00:37:06.850,00:37:10.228,I would think you'd be focused on that and not building bunk beds.
00:37:12.689,00:37:15.192,So...
00:37:15.233,00:37:17.027,BRENNAN: We can? No?
00:37:17.069,00:37:20.446,Yes.
00:37:20.488,00:37:22.074,Okay. You guys are not gonna regret this.
00:37:22.115,00:37:23.909,We're gonna get so much more activities done.
00:37:23.950,00:37:25.702,This is the funnest night ever!
00:37:28.287,00:37:30.123,This is so scary.
00:37:32.625,00:37:35.087,How you doing over there?
00:37:35.545,00:37:36.963,Okay.
00:37:37.005,00:37:39.132,Does your son know anything about carpentry?
00:37:39.174,00:37:41.259,"No, not a th..."
00:37:43.095,00:37:44.596,"Dale! Dale, no power tools!"
00:37:44.637,00:37:46.806,DALE: Oh. What?
00:37:46.848,00:37:48.307,"No, I forgot, I have to brush my teeth."
00:37:48.349,00:37:50.977,That is not your toothbrush.
00:37:51.019,00:37:53.563,"Oh, okay."
00:37:53.605,00:37:54.981,We did it.
00:37:55.023,00:37:56.608,It looks amazing!
00:37:56.649,00:37:59.945,Look at that! That looks like what you'd buy from a store!
00:37:59.986,00:38:02.530,Should've been a bunk bed all along.
00:38:02.572,00:38:05.617,We could do aerobics in here.
00:38:05.658,00:38:07.869,Do step class.
00:38:05.658,00:38:10.080,It's making my head spin how many activities we can do.
00:38:10.122,00:38:11.289,Yeah.
00:38:16.377,00:38:17.879,"Hey, I never asked you."
00:38:17.921,00:38:18.755,Do you like guacamole?
00:38:20.048,00:38:23.009,"Ah! Oh, Brennan! Oh, God!"
00:38:23.051,00:38:25.303,Brennan! Brennan!
00:38:25.971,00:38:28.306,Dad. Nancy. It's bad.
00:38:28.347,00:38:30.892,It's so bad.
00:38:30.934,00:38:34.271,The bunk beds were a terrible idea.
00:38:34.312,00:38:36.064,It's so bad!
00:38:36.106,00:38:37.232,ROBERT: How would you describe that?
00:38:37.274,00:38:39.067,Whoa.
00:38:40.152,00:38:41.319,It's not so bad.
00:38:41.360,00:38:43.029,Right. See?
00:38:44.739,00:38:45.740,Put your beds back.
00:38:45.782,00:38:48.326,Rumpus time is over.
00:38:48.367,00:38:51.246,You got a big day tomorrow.
00:38:54.749,00:38:58.086,"WOMAN OVER TV: And although she was 88 years old, she never stopped believing."
00:38:58.128,00:39:00.546,It's 8:20 in the a.m.
00:39:00.588,00:39:03.049,"Coming up next, a recent study by the American Council..."
00:39:03.091,00:39:05.802,Look at her. She's hot.
00:39:05.844,00:39:09.806,"Okay, guys, this is it."
00:39:09.848,00:39:14.727,"Dad, um, I need to borrow some clothes for the interview since I don't have any fancy clothes."
00:39:14.769,00:39:16.437,"You go in my closet, you take whatever you need."
00:39:16.479,00:39:18.148,"You, too, Brennan."
00:39:18.190,00:39:20.108,This is the most important day of our lives.
00:39:20.150,00:39:21.985,"Okay, Dad."
00:39:22.027,00:39:23.320,All right? Relax.
00:39:23.361,00:39:24.863,I gotta go. I gotta go.
00:39:24.904,00:39:26.739,"This is your day, though, guys."
00:39:26.781,00:39:28.283,This is your one day!
00:39:30.202,00:39:32.912,"Mr. Huff, Mr. Jeener is ready for your interview."
00:39:32.954,00:39:35.248,"Actually, we'll be interviewing as a team."
00:39:35.290,00:39:37.792,We're here to fuck shit up.
00:39:42.255,00:39:43.923,Move it!
00:39:52.140,00:39:54.184,Hey!
00:39:54.226,00:39:56.435,"Well, Brennan, you certainly have had a lot of jobs."
00:39:56.477,00:39:58.396,BRENNAN: I'm a bit of a spark plug.
00:39:58.437,00:40:00.357,"And, Human Resources lady, when I think..."
00:40:00.398,00:40:02.234,"Oh, oh. You know, it's..."
00:40:02.275,00:40:03.651,I'm sorry.
00:40:03.693,00:40:06.821,"Well, Pan..."
00:40:06.863,00:40:11.617,Are you saying Pan or Pam?
00:40:11.659,00:40:14.329,"Yeah, I'm sorry, who is this gentleman sitting behind you?"
00:40:14.371,00:40:15.955,"Hello, Ms. Lady."
00:40:15.997,00:40:17.832,I'm Dale.
00:40:15.997,00:40:21.336,"I'm Brennan's stepbrother, and I think I might be able to help with the Pan-Pam dilemma."
00:40:21.378,00:40:22.545,"Yeah, that'd be great."
00:40:22.587,00:40:23.671,Pam.
00:40:23.713,00:40:25.464,Pan. Pan.
00:40:25.506,00:40:27.842,Pand. There's a D on the end.
00:40:27.884,00:40:30.220,There's no D. It's Pam.
00:40:30.262,00:40:33.514,"It's like comb, except P-A-N-M."
00:40:33.556,00:40:36.101,N-N. There's two N's.
00:40:36.142,00:40:37.394,"No, there's just one M."
00:40:37.435,00:40:39.771,What do you say we interview you?
00:40:39.812,00:40:43.108,"Uh, all right. Yes, that's a sometimes-useful exercise."
00:40:43.149,00:40:44.817,Please put your hand down.
00:40:44.859,00:40:45.985,Go ahead.
00:40:46.027,00:40:49.906,How much money do you make a year before taxes?
00:40:49.948,00:40:52.242,"Okay, I'm actually not comfortable answering that."
00:40:52.284,00:40:54.994,Come on!
00:40:55.036,00:40:56.454,"Okay, here's a shot out of a cannon."
00:40:56.495,00:40:58.873,"Oprah, Barbara Walters, your wife."
00:40:58.915,00:41:01.376,"You gotta fuck one, marry one, kill one. Go!"
00:41:01.418,00:41:03.628,I think we're done here.
00:41:03.669,00:41:05.463,"Okay, first of all, I needed someone to work..."
00:41:05.504,00:41:07.173,"Wait, shut your mouth."
00:41:07.215,00:41:08.507,I think we've had enough...
00:41:08.549,00:41:10.551,Shush up for one second.
00:41:10.593,00:41:11.928,I needed someone...
00:41:11.970,00:41:14.139,Shut your mouth.
00:41:14.180,00:41:16.641,You're just coming off stupid.
00:41:16.682,00:41:20.770,You're wearing tuxedos to a job that requires you to clean bathrooms.
00:41:20.812,00:41:22.563,"Please leave this office, we're done with this interview."
00:41:22.605,00:41:24.316,Do we get any sort of souvenir?
00:41:24.357,00:41:26.692,Get out of my office!
00:41:26.734,00:41:29.988,"Yeah, I'm just looking to hire guys I don't mind hanging out with for like 12 hours a day."
00:41:30.029,00:41:32.031,You guys seem like cool guys.
00:41:32.073,00:41:34.951,"Got hair similar to mine, you wear tuxedos to the interview."
00:41:34.993,00:41:37.036,"That's funny, it's ironic."
00:41:37.078,00:41:40.915,You're kind of underplaying the whole formality of it.
00:41:40.957,00:41:44.043,"So let's do this, you know?"
00:41:44.085,00:41:46.463,"You know, unless you're like the weirdest guys ever and I don't see it."
00:41:46.504,00:41:47.797,Great.
00:42:05.482,00:42:08.318,Was that a fart?
00:42:08.360,00:42:10.278,I can taste it.
00:42:10.320,00:42:11.988,On my tongue.
00:42:12.030,00:42:14.699,"Okay, I'll be honest with you. I did fart."
00:42:14.740,00:42:17.743,Is that onion? Onion and...
00:42:17.785,00:42:21.539,It stinks.
00:42:21.580,00:42:23.541,"Okay, now the tuxedos seem kind of fucked up."
00:42:25.251,00:42:29.214,BRENNAN: God. We were so close.
00:42:29.255,00:42:32.467,"So, what do we do for jobs?"
00:42:32.509,00:42:35.553,"Listen, don't worry about my dad."
00:42:36.929,00:42:38.556,Got him sewn up.
00:42:39.932,00:42:43.520,"We've gotta start thinking bigger, though, Brennan."
00:42:43.561,00:42:46.231,"Listen, what are you really good at?"
00:42:46.272,00:42:48.983,Singing. I'm a world-class singer.
00:42:49.025,00:42:51.903,"DALE: See? Right there, that's an amazing skill."
00:42:51.944,00:42:53.571,"Now, what am I good at?"
00:42:53.612,00:42:56.574,I can shred on the drums and I'm a marketing wiz.
00:42:56.615,00:42:58.284,"Put all that together, what do you get?"
00:42:58.326,00:42:59.869,Um...
00:42:59.911,00:43:03.331,"I don't know, a band?"
00:43:03.373,00:43:08.253,"Even better, we are gonna start an international entertainment company."
00:43:08.294,00:43:11.089,The biggest and the best.
00:43:11.130,00:43:14.342,And we're gonna call it Prestige Worldwide.
00:43:14.384,00:43:16.344,That sounds so cool.
00:43:16.386,00:43:20.390,I feel like a lightning bolt hit the tip of my penis.
00:43:20.432,00:43:21.933,Yeah. Yeah.
00:43:23.518,00:43:26.396,We're brothers.
00:43:26.438,00:43:28.606,"To form this alliance, right?"
00:43:28.647,00:43:31.234,"That's why our parents met, so this idea could happen."
00:43:31.276,00:43:34.279,"Okay, what do we do?"
00:43:34.320,00:43:37.615,And we hit the beat laboratory right now. Let's go.
00:43:37.656,00:43:39.242,What?
00:43:39.284,00:43:41.035,What time is it?
00:43:41.077,00:43:42.454,4:30.
00:43:42.828,00:43:44.622,4:32.
00:43:45.081,00:43:46.958,Um...
00:43:46.999,00:43:50.503,I can't go down Whitworth right now.
00:43:51.254,00:43:52.630,We should go this way.
00:43:54.090,00:43:55.841,What's up?
00:43:55.883,00:43:57.594,What?
00:43:57.635,00:44:00.179,"He gets in my face, and I just don't wanna deal with the hassle right now."
00:44:00.221,00:44:03.349,Are you this scared?
00:44:03.391,00:44:06.227,"Well, um... Down Cutler?"
00:44:06.269,00:44:08.396,But that's 45 minutes.
00:44:08.438,00:44:10.273,You're gonna shame me into doing this. I'll do it.
00:44:10.315,00:44:11.941,"No, you sound stupid."
00:44:11.983,00:44:13.943,"Okay, I'm stupid."
00:44:15.861,00:44:18.323,"Oh, God, there they are."
00:44:19.865,00:44:22.118,"Oh, my God, is that Dale Doback?"
00:44:22.160,00:44:24.496,Let's make him lick dog shit.
00:44:26.331,00:44:29.875,"Hey, fag stick."
00:44:29.917,00:44:32.920,Is that your boyfriend?
00:44:32.962,00:44:35.256,"Look, Mr. Gardocki, just leave me alone, will you?"
00:44:35.298,00:44:37.216,"Shut your mouth, ese."
00:44:37.258,00:44:40.386,"You guys just go back and have fun on your jungle gym, okay?"
00:44:40.428,00:44:43.055,Does butt buddy have a name?
00:44:43.097,00:44:47.018,"If you're referring to me as butt buddy, yes, I do have a name."
00:44:47.059,00:44:48.520,It's Brennan Huff.
00:44:48.561,00:44:54.275,"If you don't come over here and lick that white dog shit, I'm gonna plow into your nose with my fist."
00:44:54.317,00:44:56.194,I am not licking any white dog shit.
00:44:56.235,00:44:58.279,"I'll lick the dog shit, if you leave us alone."
00:44:58.321,00:45:01.574,"Dale, you're not licking dog shit, okay? They're kids."
00:45:01.616,00:45:03.951,"Brennan, it's just dog shit."
00:45:03.993,00:45:08.289,"Hello, how are..."
00:45:08.331,00:45:10.749,Leave him alone!
00:45:12.377,00:45:14.253,Get them!
00:45:26.182,00:45:29.519,NANCY: So maybe you don't go down that way anymore.
00:45:29.561,00:45:31.728,Maybe you go the long way home.
00:45:31.770,00:45:34.857,That's what we talked about. We're gonna take the long way home.
00:45:34.899,00:45:40.655,"DALE: You know in that one scene in The Wizard of Oz, when the flying monkeys pull apart the Scarecrow?"
00:45:40.697,00:45:43.032,That's what it was like.
00:45:43.074,00:45:45.742,"It's okay, it's okay."
00:45:45.784,00:45:48.371,Is my dad mad about the stuff that happened?
00:45:48.413,00:45:51.040,"Robert was very upset, yes."
00:45:51.082,00:45:53.750,He knows that you interviewed as a team.
00:45:53.792,00:45:55.378,And he heard about the fart.
00:45:55.420,00:45:57.714,"Oh, he did?"
00:45:57.754,00:45:59.882,"You just couldn't hold it, or you..."
00:45:59.924,00:46:02.843,No. I thought it was gonna be silent.
00:46:02.885,00:46:05.555,"It just kept going, and it made a sound."
00:46:05.597,00:46:06.931,It got louder.
00:46:06.972,00:46:11.394,"So listen, Bobby, I'll get those keys made tomorrow, and then we'll start setting up times."
00:46:11.436,00:46:13.354,ROBERT: Thank you.
00:46:14.606,00:46:16.274,"Hi, Mom."
00:46:16.315,00:46:17.567,"Okay, bye."
00:46:17.609,00:46:18.735,DEREK: Always nice to see you.
00:46:18.775,00:46:20.152,"NANCY: You, too."
00:46:29.203,00:46:30.787,"Hey, guys."
00:46:30.829,00:46:33.165,"Looks like your free ride's over, huh?"
00:46:33.207,00:46:35.501,Have fun living on the streets.
00:46:35.543,00:46:38.254,"Okay, cool. Good chatting, you guys. Bye, Mom."
00:46:38.296,00:46:39.297,NANCY: Bye.
00:46:43.342,00:46:45.219,What was he doing here?
00:46:45.261,00:46:47.096,We're putting the house on the market.
00:46:47.138,00:46:48.389,Where are we moving?
00:46:48.431,00:46:49.641,Is the house haunted?
00:46:49.682,00:46:56.439,No. Nancy and I are retiring and sailing around the world on my boat.
00:46:56.481,00:46:58.857,We are living the dream.
00:46:58.899,00:46:59.816,"Well, what about us?"
00:47:02.278,00:47:06.949,I'm sorry. Robert...
00:47:02.278,00:47:10.745,We thought that you should take responsibility for your own lives.
00:47:10.787,00:47:12.204,ROBERT: And this is the exciting part.
00:47:12.246,00:47:16.668,We're going to put enough money in your accounts for a security deposit on an apartment.
00:47:16.709,00:47:18.628,What's this all about?
00:47:18.670,00:47:23.048,"More than just money, we're gonna get you another kind of support as well."
00:47:23.090,00:47:25.802,You're both gonna see therapists.
00:47:25.842,00:47:27.720,"And, guys, that's nonnegotiable."
00:47:27.762,00:47:32.891,"Hold on. We're not going on the boat, Derek's selling the house, we have to go to therapy?"
00:47:34.268,00:47:36.354,What the fuck happened?
00:47:36.395,00:47:42.193,"Look, I know this seems really, really sudden and just sort of unfair and cruel and..."
00:47:42.234,00:47:45.571,But it's nonnegotiable.
00:47:45.613,00:47:50.201,"I got a bellyful of white dog crap in me, and now you lay this shit on me?"
00:47:50.242,00:47:52.453,You're adults. It's time you started acting like adults.
00:47:53.579,00:47:56.499,Mom.
00:47:56.541,00:47:58.292,Don't even try.
00:47:58.334,00:48:01.170,"I know it seems hard, but it's the best thing for both of you."
00:48:01.212,00:48:03.130,We do it because we love you.
00:48:03.172,00:48:06.883,"Dad, I'm doing this because I love you. Fuck you."
00:48:06.925,00:48:09.136,Anything else?
00:48:09.178,00:48:11.222,Bon voyage!
00:48:12.515,00:48:14.433,"Hey, what's up, Derek?"
00:48:14.475,00:48:15.727,Yeah.
00:48:15.768,00:48:17.353,You know what?
00:48:17.395,00:48:24.068,"I'm sitting here thinking we finally got a family together here, and now it's about to be taken away from me because they think we're losers."
00:48:25.236,00:48:28.823,Because they don't understand us?
00:48:28.865,00:48:32.493,They don't get that this lifestyle is a choice.
00:48:32.535,00:48:35.872,And all they think about is that stupid boat.
00:48:35.912,00:48:39.500,"I swear, I'm so pissed off at my mom."
00:48:39.542,00:48:43.045,"As soon as she is of age, I'm putting her in a home."
00:48:43.087,00:48:45.882,We have got to get Prestige Worldwide going.
00:48:45.922,00:48:47.966,It's the only thing that's gonna save this family.
00:48:48.008,00:48:52.430,"You know, what I was thinking we should do is have a investor presentation like they do on The Apprentice."
00:48:52.471,00:48:54.682,"Yeah, we gotta start with some capital somewhere."
00:48:54.724,00:48:57.142,"Here's the thing, though."
00:48:57.184,00:49:02.064,"If we're gonna start a huge multinational corporation, I'm gonna have to hear you sing."
00:49:02.106,00:49:05.276,"Can't you just trust that I'm a really, really good singer?"
00:49:05.317,00:49:07.944,"Just one song, so I know what your voice sounds like."
00:49:08.780,00:49:11.156,"Yeah, yeah. I'll just do it."
00:49:11.198,00:49:14.452,No big deal. I'll just dive into it and just start singing.
00:49:19.081,00:49:21.876,"Jesus, my heart is beating so fast right now."
00:49:22.877,00:49:25.212,"Okay, just do it."
00:49:25.254,00:49:26.171,Just...
00:50:15.805,00:50:17.849,"You know, I don't know."
00:50:17.890,00:50:20.518,"I didn't wanna sing too loud, because I don't wanna wake up Robert and Nancy."
00:50:20.559,00:50:24.396,My throat's sore.
00:50:24.438,00:50:29.318,And this is not an acoustic environment that's suitable to request this from me.
00:50:29.360,00:50:32.822,"You gotta know, I'm not just some guy."
00:50:32.864,00:50:35.407,"Brennan, that is the voice of an angel."
00:50:38.202,00:50:41.079,"Brennan, I can't even make eye contact with you right now."
00:50:41.121,00:50:44.000,Your voice is like a combination of Fergie and Jesus.
00:50:44.040,00:50:45.793,Why can't you do that in front of people?
00:50:45.835,00:50:47.419,Are you messing with me right now?
00:50:48.086,00:50:49.672,"It's me, Dale."
00:50:51.757,00:50:53.759,You're good.
00:50:53.801,00:50:56.261,I know.
00:50:53.801,00:51:01.726,"This is gonna sound weird, but for a second, I think you took on the shape of a unicorn."
00:51:01.767,00:51:07.314,"I felt like I was hovering above my own body, watching myself sing."
00:51:07.356,00:51:09.734,"Now, let's move on to other business."
00:51:09.775,00:51:12.862,"Now, first thing tomorrow, we gotta get cracking on this investor presentation."
00:51:12.904,00:51:15.656,And guess what else.
00:51:15.698,00:51:17.199,What?
00:51:17.700,00:51:19.451,Yeah!
00:51:20.828,00:51:22.454,"Okay, what do we do about Derek and the house?"
00:51:24.248,00:51:25.207,Don't worry about him.
00:51:36.969,00:51:38.470,"Oh, it's a great nabe."
00:51:38.512,00:51:40.514,"You know, Frank Gifford used to live right down the block."
00:51:40.556,00:51:43.935,MAN: The Giff?
00:51:43.976,00:51:46.520,I'm getting a really good feeling about this.
00:51:46.562,00:51:47.939,I am so glad.
00:51:47.980,00:51:50.232,"You get us that 10-year interest-only loan, I think we got a deal."
00:51:50.274,00:51:53.611,"Hey, fuckers. Welcome to the neighborhood!"
00:51:53.652,00:51:55.738,My name is Craig.
00:51:55.780,00:51:57.907,"Um, the neighbor is a Nazi?"
00:51:57.949,00:52:01.452,"You guys ever need fertilizer, I've got a lot of it. Close to 80 tons."
00:52:01.493,00:52:03.328,"Hey, folks!"
00:52:03.370,00:52:05.581,How you doing? You're gonna love this neighborhood.
00:52:05.623,00:52:07.833,Every single house here recycles.
00:52:07.875,00:52:09.794,"Okay, we're done here."
00:52:09.835,00:52:13.255,"Hey, Derek, sprechen sie dick?"
00:52:13.297,00:52:18.134,"So, Dale, I don't know how much you know about therapy, but it usually starts by you telling me a little something about yourself."
00:52:19.303,00:52:24.558,"I work at a college as a janitor, even though I feel like I'm smarter than most of the people that go there."
00:52:24.600,00:52:30.522,"Sometimes I see an equation written on a blackboard, like half an equation, and I'll just figure it out."
00:52:30.564,00:52:33.525,Is this Good Will Hunting?
00:52:33.567,00:52:36.361,It sounds a lot like the plot of Good Will Hunting.
00:52:36.403,00:52:40.365,Yeah. Anyway.
00:52:40.407,00:52:43.119,So I thought we'd begin talking about your parents' divorce.
00:52:43.535,00:52:44.996,Okay.
00:52:45.037,00:52:46.956,How old were you when they got divorced?
00:52:46.998,00:52:49.333,Fifteen.
00:52:49.374,00:52:52.044,Yes. Yeah.
00:52:52.086,00:52:53.712,Do you wanna talk about some of those feelings?
00:52:53.754,00:52:56.757,I love you.
00:52:56.799,00:52:58.634,I love you so much.
00:52:58.676,00:53:01.846,Thank you.
00:52:58.676,00:53:04.264,And I will take that as a feeling that you have of comfortability with me.
00:53:04.306,00:53:06.266,It's more than comfortability.
00:53:06.308,00:53:09.728,"I mean, I fucking love you."
00:53:09.770,00:53:12.148,I'm just thinking about our life together.
00:53:12.188,00:53:14.025,I feel like I'm walking on a cloud.
00:53:14.066,00:53:16.568,My penis is tingling right now.
00:53:16.610,00:53:20.698,That is so off-putting.
00:53:20.739,00:53:26.787,"In no way, shape or form do I feel any feelings of intimacy towards you in any way whatsoever."
00:53:26.829,00:53:28.956,"As you can see, you got a really dope front lawn here."
00:53:28.998,00:53:30.791,You and your homeboys can play on that.
00:53:30.833,00:53:32.793,You can just say It looks good.
00:53:32.835,00:53:34.170,"No, that's how I talk."
00:53:34.210,00:53:37.589,"Oh, you got a really fresh entryway here. Pretty awesome."
00:53:37.631,00:53:40.843,"...show you the front of the house, which is actual..."
00:53:40.885,00:53:44.889,Will you vultures please give us some privacy?
00:53:44.930,00:53:46.515,What is going on here?
00:53:46.557,00:53:48.976,"It was the asbestos in here, that's what did it!"
00:53:49.018,00:53:50.394,I've seen too many dead bodies.
00:53:50.435,00:53:52.980,I can't be in here. I can't.
00:53:55.941,00:53:57.609,Not bad.
00:53:59.235,00:54:01.572,"DEREK: Awesome B-day party, broheisens."
00:54:01.613,00:54:02.907,"MAN: You the man, Derek."
00:54:02.948,00:54:05.534,"DEREK: Okay, who's this from? Uh, TJ?"
00:54:05.576,00:54:07.661,"Where are the rest of my gifts, dude?"
00:54:07.703,00:54:10.998,"Totally joking around, TJ."
00:54:11.040,00:54:15.544,"Oh, yes! Yes!"
00:54:15.586,00:54:16.962,DEREK: Yeah!
00:54:17.004,00:54:19.048,DEREK: Yeah.
00:54:19.090,00:54:21.050,"Bomb it down the fairway, bitches!"
00:54:24.011,00:54:25.804,"Hi, my name is Jim."
00:54:25.846,00:54:27.098,No!
00:54:27.139,00:54:27.973,It's just me.
00:54:28.015,00:54:30.266,"Oh, my God."
00:54:30.308,00:54:32.019,What are you doing?
00:54:32.061,00:54:34.063,Happy anniversary.
00:54:34.105,00:54:36.774,It's our second date.
00:54:36.815,00:54:40.903,"Listen, I'm sick of being all coy and bashful, Dale."
00:54:40.945,00:54:43.447,We're in the bathroom.
00:54:43.488,00:54:44.907,There's really little you can do about it.
00:54:44.949,00:54:46.658,Let me just hop on.
00:54:47.283,00:54:48.452,Ah!
00:54:48.493,00:54:49.285,It's all slippery.
00:54:51.538,00:54:52.873,"Oh, my God!"
00:54:52.915,00:54:54.374,Whoo!
00:54:57.628,00:55:00.464,What are you doing?
00:55:01.924,00:55:02.967,Ah!
00:55:09.056,00:55:10.348,We just had sex.
00:55:11.225,00:55:13.227,Just the way I imagined.
00:55:13.269,00:55:14.770,I like you.
00:55:15.395,00:55:17.106,I love you.
00:55:17.148,00:55:19.066,"Stay golden, Ponyboy."
00:55:21.152,00:55:23.570,"Oh, my God."
00:55:23.612,00:55:25.781,You're incredible.
00:55:25.823,00:55:28.075,Say hello to my little friend.
00:55:30.326,00:55:31.787,Just kidding.
00:55:31.829,00:55:32.997,Scarface.
00:55:34.873,00:55:36.959,Shut the fuck up!
00:55:37.001,00:55:39.377,"Sweet-ass gift, Teej."
00:55:39.419,00:55:41.337,I got it all mapped out.
00:55:41.379,00:55:44.800,"I'm following your lead, though."
00:55:44.842,00:55:46.135,Okay.
00:55:46.177,00:55:48.012,And then we'll drop the hammer.
00:55:49.888,00:55:51.807,"Excuse me, everyone, if I could have your attention, please."
00:55:53.349,00:55:56.228,"For those of you who don't know me, my name's Dale Doback."
00:55:56.270,00:55:57.980,Uh...
00:55:58.022,00:56:03.359,"Probably wondering why we gathered you here tonight, besides Derek's birthday."
00:56:03.401,00:56:06.238,"We got a special surprise for you, Derek, and everybody here..."
00:56:06.280,00:56:07.614,"Check, check."
00:56:07.656,00:56:09.783,"Dale. No, please."
00:56:09.825,00:56:12.161,"Dale, I'm begging you."
00:56:12.203,00:56:13.996,"Yeah, well, just hold on a sec."
00:56:12.203,00:56:18.000,"Derek, for your birthday, we thought we'd roll out a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity."
00:56:18.042,00:56:19.001,"Happy birthday, Derek."
00:56:19.751,00:56:21.170,Music.
00:56:24.589,00:56:28.635,"Prestige Worldwide, wide, wide, wide."
00:56:29.845,00:56:32.472,Prestige Worldwide.
00:56:32.514,00:56:35.391,The first word in entertainment.
00:56:35.433,00:56:37.477,Management.
00:56:37.519,00:56:39.604,Insurance.
00:56:39.646,00:56:43.108,Black leather gloves.
00:56:43.150,00:56:46.070,Putting in the man-hours to study the science of what you need.
00:56:46.111,00:56:50.741,"Last week we put Liquid Paper on a bee, and it died."
00:56:50.782,00:56:52.076,BRENNAN: Security.
00:56:52.117,00:56:53.451,And...
00:56:56.080,00:56:57.873,Possibly you.
00:56:57.915,00:57:01.835,"Oh, this is classic."
00:56:57.915,00:57:09.593,"DALE: We'd like to present the world premiere of Prestige Worldwide's first music video, by our first act, Huff and Doback."
00:57:09.634,00:57:11.427,Roll it.
00:57:13.471,00:57:15.724,"Pay close attention, Dad."
00:57:17.559,00:57:20.229,This is... This is perfect.
00:57:20.271,00:57:22.606,"DALE: Yes, it is."
00:57:22.647,00:57:24.566,What are you doing on my boat? That's my boat.
00:57:24.608,00:57:43.252,The Santa Maria While you're drinking sangria On my dad's boat 'Cause my dick can float And go port to port I produce a quart That is offensive.
00:57:43.294,00:58:05.274,my boats and ho's Without the crabs Call the Arabs 'Cause we're leaving dry land With a dick in your hand Boats and ho's My boats and ho's Get a partner.
00:58:05.316,00:58:07.818,Who's steering the boat?
00:58:07.859,00:58:09.194,Please shut up!
00:58:12.614,00:58:13.907,Oh! Oh! Oh!
00:58:18.036,00:58:20.456,Oh!
00:58:26.044,00:58:27.712,So...
00:58:27.754,00:58:37.514,"Big question is, aside from the damage to the boat, which we will fix, what'd you guys think of the presentation?"
00:58:37.555,00:58:43.603,"Brennan, I think that what you did to Robert's boat was horrid."
00:58:43.645,00:58:49.609,"Having said that, I think that both of you boys showed a lot of enthusiasm and inventiveness."
00:58:49.651,00:58:52.029,Yes. Thank you.
00:58:52.070,00:58:55.032,You gotta be kidding me.
00:58:55.073,00:58:57.951,They destroyed our dream and you're calling it inventive.
00:58:57.993,00:59:00.412,"No, no, no."
00:59:00.454,00:59:02.164,"Come on, you did."
00:59:02.206,00:59:05.667,"It's gonna be four years, at least, before we can sail anywhere."
00:59:05.709,00:59:09.380,"And you could care less, admit it."
00:59:05.709,00:59:11.715,"I will not admit that, because it is not true."
00:59:11.756,00:59:21.099,"But, you know, I do think that you could show a little bit more attentiveness to your son and your stepson, who obviously need you."
00:59:21.141,00:59:22.518,"It's true, Dr. Doback."
00:59:22.559,00:59:25.645,You've been very cold and unsupportive of our dreams.
00:59:25.687,00:59:27.481,"You wrecked my fucking boat, you goon!"
00:59:27.523,00:59:29.733,Don't speak to my son like that.
00:59:29.774,00:59:32.444,"Your son's costing me $80,000."
00:59:32.486,00:59:35.989,"Look, we could bicker about this all night, but what's done is done, Dad."
00:59:36.031,00:59:38.825,Are you guys gonna invest or not?
00:59:38.867,00:59:40.118,"Dad, what are you doing?"
00:59:41.412,00:59:43.288,"Dad, I can't believe you're being so stingy."
00:59:43.330,00:59:45.957,"Robert, come back down."
00:59:45.999,00:59:47.501,You jackaloons!
00:59:47.543,00:59:51.422,You're failures! Failures!
00:59:51.463,00:59:54.383,"And you're embarrassing yourself, you geriatric fuck!"
00:59:54.425,00:59:56.301,Brennan.
00:59:56.343,01:00:00.389,You keep your liver-spotted hands off my beautiful mother.
01:00:00.431,01:00:03.934,"And then you sit down and you write Dale and Brennan a check for $10,000."
01:00:03.975,01:00:05.685,"Oh, stop it."
01:00:05.727,01:00:09.231,Or I'm gonna shove one of those fake hearing devices so far up your ass...
01:00:09.273,01:00:10.774,Brennan!
01:00:09.273,01:00:14.652,...you can hear the sound of your small intestine as it produces shit!
01:00:14.694,01:00:16.488,"All right, here we go."
01:00:16.530,01:00:19.575,"Somebody should've done this a long time ago, and I'm gonna do it."
01:00:19.616,01:00:21.452,"Dad, what are you doing?"
01:00:21.493,01:00:23.328,You have to learn there are consequences for your actions.
01:00:23.370,01:00:26.290,"Oh, no! Robert! Oh!"
01:00:26.331,01:00:28.417,"Dad, this is not the answer."
01:00:28.459,01:00:29.667,You understand me?
01:00:29.709,01:00:33.171,Certain behaviors...
01:00:33.213,01:00:35.591,...will not be tolerated!
01:00:46.560,01:00:50.481,"Wow, the tree looks great, Nancy. Really tasteful."
01:00:51.189,01:00:52.732,"Thank you, Dale."
01:00:52.774,01:00:55.193,"Uh, that's a very nice sweater you're wearing."
01:00:55.235,01:00:58.530,It was my mom's.
01:00:58.572,01:01:00.824,"Oh, and, Brennan?"
01:00:58.572,01:01:06.580,"Denise called, and she said she can't go out with you on New Year's Eve because she's not your girlfriend, she's your therapist."
01:01:06.622,01:01:08.081,Is that what she said?
01:01:08.123,01:01:09.458,She's a rascal.
01:01:09.500,01:01:11.835,"DALE: Hey, Dad, Nancy?"
01:01:11.876,01:01:19.301,Would it be cool if Brennan and I opened just one present each since it's Christmas Eve?
01:01:19.343,01:01:22.179,"I'm gonna go down to the Cheesecake Factory, have a drink."
01:01:24.264,01:01:27.225,"Uh, but it's Christmas Eve."
01:01:27.267,01:01:28.685,Oh. Merry Christmas.
01:01:30.521,01:01:32.481,BRENNAN: Yeah.
01:01:32.523,01:01:35.359,I had my eye on one.
01:01:35.400,01:01:37.277,DALE: I hope it's what I think it is.
01:01:37.319,01:01:39.613,"Oh, my God. Hulk Hands!"
01:01:39.655,01:01:40.697,"BRENNAN: Wait, Dale got Hulk Hands?"
01:01:46.453,01:01:48.997,"Well, you reek of Scotch and cheesecake."
01:01:50.582,01:01:58.298,"You know, tonight at the Cheesecake Factory was the happiest that I have been in months."
01:01:58.340,01:02:01.885,"Well, then I feel very sorry for you."
01:02:01.926,01:02:05.972,"Nancy, I don't know if I can ever forgive them for wrecking my boat."
01:02:06.014,01:02:08.725,Why are you giving up?
01:02:08.766,01:02:10.602,You are. You're giving up on our boys.
01:02:10.644,01:02:13.021,But they're 40.
01:02:13.063,01:02:16.149,"I don't care how old they are, Robert."
01:02:16.191,01:02:19.403,"Well, sometime it's got to matter how old they are."
01:02:19.444,01:02:22.280,"That's all we do, is..."
01:02:22.322,01:02:24.408,"Oh, it... You know, they'll go back to bed."
01:02:26.493,01:02:28.370,See? They're sleepwalking.
01:02:28.412,01:02:30.497,No. No.
01:02:30.539,01:02:33.166,"See, back to bed."
01:02:33.208,01:02:34.751,They'll be fine.
01:02:34.792,01:02:37.421,Just nonsense.
01:02:37.462,01:02:41.132,No. Why would you do such a thing?
01:02:41.174,01:02:43.677,"Never, ever wake up a sleepwalker."
01:02:43.719,01:02:45.345,We can't ever do anything.
01:02:45.387,01:02:47.972,But they could do real harm to themselves or others.
01:02:48.014,01:02:50.642,"Oh, the Christmas presents."
01:02:50.684,01:02:53.270,No. But...
01:02:53.311,01:02:54.479,It's always about them.
01:02:54.521,01:02:56.565,"How do you propose to do that, Robert?"
01:02:56.607,01:02:58.942,"Oh, Jesus."
01:02:58.983,01:03:02.195,They might do real harm to themselves or others.
01:03:02.237,01:03:04.989,Not everybody does know that.
01:03:05.031,01:03:08.535,"Oh, not the... No, don't..."
01:03:08.577,01:03:10.704,I'm waking them up!
01:03:10.746,01:03:12.205,"Oh, that's a myth!"
01:03:12.247,01:03:13.540,"Wake up, both of you."
01:03:15.542,01:03:18.128,I told you!
01:03:19.129,01:03:21.798,Stop it! Don't hurt him!
01:03:21.839,01:03:24.259,The pictures! Nancy!
01:03:34.394,01:03:37.355,"DEREK: ...grant me this one, because I was pretty wasted."
01:03:37.397,01:03:41.859,So I put my lips around that breathalyzer and I saw those numerals pop up.
01:03:41.901,01:03:46.990,0.079.
01:03:47.031,01:03:51.578,"So I just drove off, I started going on my way to Chad Michael Murray's Christmas party."
01:03:51.620,01:03:53.913,I think that was the year.
01:03:53.955,01:03:57.542,I have to interrupt you.
01:03:53.955,01:03:59.836,"Robert, while the children are in the living room, I think this would be a good time to make our announcement."
01:04:00.462,01:04:02.172,What's going on?
01:04:02.213,01:04:04.299,It's over.
01:04:04.341,01:04:09.596,"I'm gonna be moving in with my friend Jack Handle, and Nancy found a townhouse in the city."
01:04:10.847,01:04:12.724,What is this?
01:04:12.766,01:04:16.561,What Robert is trying to say is that we are getting a divorce.
01:04:16.603,01:04:19.481,Don't do this.
01:04:19.523,01:04:21.024,"I gotta say, I could've called this one."
01:04:23.485,01:04:25.529,Is it because we were bad?
01:04:25.570,01:04:31.493,The main thing that Robert and I talked about is that we did not want you two to blame yourselves.
01:04:31.535,01:04:34.830,What can we do to fix it?
01:04:34.871,01:04:36.956,Why are you calling him honey?
01:04:36.998,01:04:40.001,I cannot stress this enough.
01:04:40.043,01:04:43.338,Whose fault is it?
01:04:43.380,01:04:46.717,Let's cut the shit.
01:04:46.758,01:04:48.009,NANCY: Robert.
01:04:48.051,01:04:49.761,You destroyed my boat.
01:04:49.803,01:04:55.726,"You beat me up in your sleep, and worst of all, you made Nancy and I resent each other."
01:04:55.767,01:04:59.688,It is absolutely 150 percent your fault!
01:04:59.730,01:05:01.022,Of course it's their fault.
01:05:01.064,01:05:04.108,"They're the two biggest dickheads in the world, and they're living in your house."
01:05:04.150,01:05:05.694,"Shut up, Derek."
01:05:07.821,01:05:11.324,Please don't cry like that.
01:05:16.246,01:05:19.123,Dale!
01:05:19.165,01:05:22.001,I told you that they would feel completely to blame.
01:05:22.043,01:05:23.837,"Oh, let's grow up."
01:05:23.879,01:05:26.130,I think I'm going to throw up.
01:05:26.172,01:05:28.383,I think I'm gonna throw up...
01:05:28.425,01:05:32.512,...all the nice dinner that I had.
01:05:32.554,01:05:34.180,"You're not gonna throw up, Dale."
01:05:36.140,01:05:38.894,Come on.
01:05:38.935,01:05:41.312,"Hey, guys. Guys."
01:05:41.354,01:05:44.190,"All right, dipshits."
01:05:44.232,01:05:45.817,"One, two, three..."
01:05:45.859,01:05:48.904,I don't want my picture taken right now.
01:05:55.869,01:05:58.872,"Guys, good luck, and remember, I need you out of this house by tomorrow."
01:05:58.914,01:06:00.457,No exceptions.
01:06:09.966,01:06:15.430,"If there's anything you need, anything that you boys need, you just give me a call."
01:06:21.812,01:06:24.147,Hey. Are you awake?
01:06:25.690,01:06:27.317,Yeah.
01:06:30.069,01:06:33.531,I can't believe we actually have to move out of this house.
01:06:34.157,01:06:36.952,I know. I feel bad.
01:06:36.993,01:06:39.621,"Hey, you know, we don't have to whisper anymore."
01:06:39.663,01:06:40.997,Mom and Dad aren't here.
01:06:41.038,01:06:43.124,"Yeah, but can we keep doing it, though?"
01:06:43.166,01:06:44.668,It helps me pretend that they are.
01:06:45.794,01:06:47.796,You must feel just terrible.
01:06:49.172,01:06:52.717,"I mean, I know I feel bad."
01:06:52.759,01:07:00.851,But I can't imagine how you feel after my dad looked right at you and said it's all your fault that they broke up.
01:07:00.892,01:07:10.610,"That's funny, 'cause my mom said, If that curly-headed fuck Dale wasn't here, everything would be perfect."
01:07:10.652,01:07:11.945,You take that back.
01:07:11.987,01:07:14.113,No way. It's your fault.
01:07:14.155,01:07:16.324,You know what your problem is?
01:07:16.366,01:07:19.327,You live in a fantasy land.
01:07:16.366,01:07:22.079,You refuse to get a job and you don't even know what it's like to work for something.
01:07:22.121,01:07:25.834,"You don't take responsibility for your actions, and that's why this is all your fault!"
01:07:25.876,01:07:28.879,"Well, you're a mama's boy who's too chicken to sing in public!"
01:07:30.922,01:07:32.298,"Yeah, that's right."
01:07:32.340,01:07:34.718,"Run away, little boy, because you know it's true."
01:07:34.759,01:07:36.511,Just avoid everything.
01:07:37.762,01:07:40.473,What are you doing?
01:07:40.515,01:07:43.560,Mother fucker!
01:07:43.601,01:07:49.065,Dale broke up Mom and Dad Brennan!
01:07:55.112,01:07:57.949,"Get up, Brennan, I know you're faking."
01:07:58.449,01:08:00.076,Get up!
01:08:06.374,01:08:08.001,Brennan?
01:08:08.043,01:08:09.753,It's just like Cold Case Files.
01:08:09.794,01:08:11.295,It's just like Cold Case Files.
01:08:11.337,01:08:12.839,It's just like Cold Case Files.
01:08:13.673,01:08:16.300,People die every day.
01:08:16.342,01:08:20.096,Give him a proper burial in an unmarked grave...
01:08:24.559,01:08:27.270,Brennan!
01:08:27.311,01:08:28.438,I'm alive.
01:08:31.107,01:08:35.028,You were dead. I saw you die!
01:08:35.070,01:08:37.113,I used ninja focus to slow my heart rate down.
01:08:38.364,01:08:40.742,What are you doing?
01:08:40.784,01:08:44.328,"I'm alive. Brennan, I'm alive."
01:08:44.370,01:08:46.205,Shut up!
01:08:47.916,01:08:51.252,Now I'm gonna play your drum set.
01:08:55.048,01:08:56.633,This is your fault.
01:08:57.968,01:09:02.055,"Oh, I'm exhausted."
01:09:05.058,01:09:07.769,Don't you touch my drums!
01:09:07.811,01:09:10.396,Zombie! Zombie!
01:09:15.443,01:09:16.527,Get off.
01:09:29.124,01:09:30.750,I'm late for school.
01:09:30.792,01:09:33.753,"I will kiss you right on the mouth, Kenny Rogers."
01:09:35.254,01:09:37.048,Just get off me.
01:09:40.010,01:09:41.052,Ow.
01:09:41.094,01:09:43.096,So I guess it's really over.
01:09:43.138,01:09:46.016,I'd say you trying to bury me alive pretty much did it.
01:09:46.057,01:09:48.309,You know what I just realized?
01:09:48.351,01:09:50.770,You've been the one that's been dragging me down.
01:09:50.812,01:09:57.276,"Now I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna get a job and an apartment, and then I'm gonna get Mom and Dr. Doback back together."
01:09:57.318,01:09:59.403,"I'm gonna be the hero, and you can suck on it."
01:10:03.240,01:10:06.119,My life was perfect before you came here.
01:10:06.161,01:10:09.455,"Me and my dad had a perfect setup, and you wrecked it."
01:10:13.501,01:10:14.544,Hey.
01:10:15.920,01:10:18.214,We're no longer brothers.
01:10:18.255,01:10:21.217,We never were.
01:10:33.688,01:10:35.272,Oh!
01:10:35.314,01:10:37.233,That was one of your best.
01:10:38.609,01:10:40.653,All right.
01:10:43.114,01:10:45.241,"Can you give me a job, please?"
01:10:46.993,01:10:50.329,"TJ, get an office pool going."
01:10:50.371,01:10:54.084,"Give Ken-Doll Crotch here two weeks, tops."
01:10:54.125,01:11:00.256,"Dr. Angel Face, I just wanted to say thank you for meeting me on such short notice."
01:11:00.297,01:11:02.884,Don't call me Angel Face.
01:11:02.926,01:11:08.014,"I'm very alone right now, and the thing I wanna ask you to help me..."
01:11:08.056,01:11:10.934,To show me how I can be a grown-up.
01:11:10.975,01:11:13.144,Do I carry my high school diploma around with me?
01:11:13.186,01:11:14.812,What do you do with your hair in the morning?
01:11:14.854,01:11:17.107,What happens if there's inclement weather?
01:11:17.148,01:11:18.858,Where do you...
01:11:18.900,01:11:20.818,Can you wash your clothes in the dishwasher?
01:11:20.860,01:11:31.287,"I notice that there's a long gap in your job history, and it said, uh, for 22 years you went Kerouac on everyone's ass?"
01:11:31.328,01:11:33.748,"Look, I'm gonna be honest with you. I really need a job."
01:11:33.790,01:11:41.214,"And I will take any position, as long as it doesn't involve having sex with old ladies for money or bear traps."
01:11:41.256,01:11:43.967,Those are my two bugaboos.
01:11:44.008,01:11:46.886,"There's a catering business, there's a temp job that's open for you."
01:11:46.928,01:11:49.139,And you get to play with fire.
01:13:01.711,01:13:04.047,"What do you want, Brennan?"
01:13:04.088,01:13:06.382,I'm just gonna say it.
01:13:06.423,01:13:08.634,"Ho, ho!"
01:13:08.676,01:13:11.095,"I know what it entails, and I'm ready to nail it."
01:13:11.137,01:13:13.681,"I want it, okay?"
01:13:13.723,01:13:15.850,"Yo, yo."
01:13:15.892,01:13:17.227,You tell him what's up?
01:13:17.268,01:13:18.811,Hey.
01:13:18.853,01:13:21.772,Hey. Your brother wants a shot at the Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:13:21.814,01:13:22.982,"I'm ready, I'm walking tall."
01:13:23.024,01:13:25.109,You think you're ready to run with the bulls?
01:13:25.151,01:13:28.404,"I've been earning and burning, snapping necks and cashing checks."
01:13:29.780,01:13:31.074,"Screw it, let's let him do it."
01:13:31.115,01:13:35.036,"No, it's a win-win for me, because if you fuck up, Brennan, if you fuck up..."
01:13:35.078,01:13:38.915,I get to fire your ass.
01:13:38.956,01:13:40.708,Pow!
01:13:40.750,01:13:42.835,I get it.
01:13:42.877,01:13:44.921,"It's the Catalina fucking Wine Mixer, okay?"
01:13:44.962,01:13:47.131,Pow!
01:13:47.173,01:13:48.632,What are you saying?
01:13:48.674,01:13:53.679,It's the biggest helicopter-leasing event in the Western Hemisphere since 1997.
01:13:53.721,01:13:55.556,Pow!
01:13:55.598,01:13:59.810,I have to sell or lease at least 80 choppers to make my nut.
01:13:59.852,01:14:04.232,"And you mess with my nut, Brennan, Randy here is gonna eat your dick."
01:14:04.815,01:14:07.318,Like Kobayashi.
01:14:08.819,01:14:10.113,I've seen him do it.
01:14:10.154,01:14:11.739,You've actually seen him eat a man's penis?
01:14:11.781,01:14:14.867,"It was in international waters, so they couldn't prosecute him, but I saw it."
01:14:14.909,01:14:17.745,"I tell you right now, I'll nail it."
01:14:17.787,01:14:19.622,"Wait a second, why do you want this so bad, Brennan?"
01:14:19.663,01:14:22.166,You trying to get Mom and Dad back together or something?
01:14:22.208,01:14:23.793,Why do I want this?
01:14:23.834,01:14:26.503,"Because I wanna make bank, bro."
01:14:26.545,01:14:28.714,I wanna get ass.
01:14:28.756,01:14:30.633,And I wanna drive a Range Rover.
01:14:30.674,01:14:32.427,"Okay, well, you better, Brennan."
01:14:32.468,01:14:34.178,This is the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:14:34.220,01:14:35.471,"Pow, pow!"
01:14:53.030,01:14:55.158,Nancy. Hi.
01:14:55.199,01:14:58.577,Hi. What are you doing here?
01:14:58.619,01:15:00.997,"Well, Dale's working the function."
01:15:01.038,01:15:03.707,"Guys, this is supposed to be jicama, not bok choy."
01:15:03.749,01:15:04.541,"Sorry, folks."
01:15:06.502,01:15:09.005,And I got an invitation from Brennan.
01:15:09.046,01:15:11.590,Can you believe Brennan put all this together?
01:15:12.467,01:15:13.509,Mm-mmm.
01:15:14.635,01:15:17.472,And now here we all are in Catalina.
01:15:17.513,01:15:20.224,"It's funny, huh?"
01:15:21.100,01:15:23.353,"Hey, hey, hey."
01:15:24.979,01:15:27.190,Not bad.
01:15:27.231,01:15:29.692,"Thanks, Randy."
01:15:29.733,01:15:33.821,"Goddamn it, I don't know what it is about your face, but I wanna deliver one of these right in your suck hole."
01:15:33.863,01:15:35.614,Is there anything I can do to work on that?
01:15:35.656,01:15:37.241,No. Not really.
01:15:37.283,01:15:38.493,"And again, you know, you're doing great, man."
01:15:38.534,01:15:40.036,This is the Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:15:40.077,01:15:41.954,"We're all having a great time, everybody's having fun."
01:15:41.996,01:15:44.540,"You pulled it off, all right?"
01:15:41.996,01:15:46.083,"But if you don't change your face, I'm gonna change it for you."
01:15:46.125,01:15:52.965,"Okay. Okay. All I can do is take that in and consider it, and I'll just try to do my best version of whatever I think that would be."
01:15:53.007,01:15:55.676,"I don't even hear what you're saying right now, because your face is driving me nuts."
01:15:55.718,01:15:58.262,"Okay. Thanks again, though."
01:15:58.304,01:16:01.598,Hey.
01:16:01.640,01:16:04.394,How are you?
01:16:04.435,01:16:07.563,We are California's pre-eminent 1980s Billy Joel cover band.
01:16:08.314,01:16:10.316,Piano Man! Whoo!
01:16:10.358,01:16:12.443,"What did I just say, man?"
01:16:12.485,01:16:17.323,"All right, we don't play that, so let's keep it in the late '80s and let's keep it fun, okay?"
01:16:17.365,01:16:19.075,You guys having a good time?
01:16:19.116,01:16:21.118,"I hope you are, because, you know, I know sometimes life can be tough."
01:16:21.160,01:16:25.331,And I know that sometimes it's hard to Keeping the Faith.
01:16:36.467,01:16:38.428,You guys seem to be hitting it off.
01:16:38.469,01:16:39.887,"Oh, honey."
01:16:39.929,01:16:42.306,"Oh, my God, this is the greatest party."
01:16:42.348,01:16:43.558,"Hello, Robert."
01:16:43.599,01:16:45.518,"Brennan, this is fantastic."
01:16:45.560,01:16:48.187,Well...
01:16:48.229,01:16:50.440,"Hi, Dad. Hi, Nancy."
01:16:50.481,01:16:52.275,"Hey, Brennan."
01:16:52.316,01:16:54.277,Thanks for hiring our catering company.
01:16:54.318,01:16:56.195,Easy decision. You guys have a outstanding track record.
01:16:57.905,01:17:00.783,"Just like old times, huh?"
01:17:00.824,01:17:02.743,You still have your night-vision goggles?
01:17:02.785,01:17:06.872,"No, no."
01:17:06.914,01:17:08.583,Oh.
01:17:08.624,01:17:10.751,You still breaking boards or kicking holes in pumpkins or anything?
01:17:11.586,01:17:12.795,No.
01:17:13.879,01:17:17.383,But I did start taking baby aspirin to reduce my risk for heart attack.
01:17:17.425,01:17:19.385,That makes sense.
01:17:19.427,01:17:20.553,Really do.
01:17:20.595,01:17:23.055,Knock off the sweets.
01:17:27.684,01:17:30.771,It's a tru...
01:17:30.813,01:17:32.064,Yeah.
01:17:32.106,01:17:34.817,"Dale, the empanadas are starting to sweat."
01:17:34.858,01:17:37.111,Okay. I better run.
01:17:37.153,01:17:39.155,"It's good to see you, Brennan."
01:17:39.196,01:17:40.531,"Take care, be well."
01:17:40.573,01:17:42.699,"All right, take care, Dad."
01:17:42.741,01:17:44.660,It's great to talk to him.
01:17:45.620,01:17:46.996,"I gotta go, too."
01:17:47.037,01:17:49.665,We should do this again.
01:17:54.462,01:17:56.631,Maybe grab a bite to eat?
01:17:56.672,01:17:58.799,Go to Outback Steakhouse.
01:17:58.841,01:18:00.050,I've grown very fond of that place.
01:18:01.927,01:18:03.971,Thank you for coming.
01:18:04.013,01:18:05.348,Great to see you.
01:18:07.350,01:18:10.227,"It was very nice to see you, Robert."
01:18:10.269,01:18:14.607,I think... I think Brennan organized this whole thing to get us back together.
01:18:17.527,01:18:22.406,You have to excuse me.
01:18:22.448,01:18:24.741,It's the funniest thing.
01:18:29.913,01:18:33.042,"MAN: Start the Fire, buddy!"
01:18:33.083,01:18:36.504,"Come on, man."
01:18:42.510,01:18:44.679,'80s Billy Joel doo-wop sucks!
01:18:44.720,01:18:47.473,"Hey, listen, mother fucker, we only sing '80s Joel!"
01:18:47.515,01:18:49.392,So take your skank hooker wife and get the fuck out of here!
01:18:51.977,01:18:53.396,Shit.
01:18:53.437,01:18:55.648,What's wrong?
01:18:55.690,01:18:57.816,Get him out of here.
01:18:57.858,01:18:59.527,Hey.
01:18:59.569,01:19:03.072,"Hey, great job, fuck face."
01:19:03.113,01:19:05.741,Just relax. I didn't realize he would say these things.
01:19:05.782,01:19:07.784,You know what?
01:19:07.826,01:19:10.538,"So this isn't even a judgment call, man."
01:19:10.580,01:19:13.416,"You're Audi 5000, my friend."
01:19:13.457,01:19:14.750,No.
01:19:14.791,01:19:16.877,Hey.
01:19:16.919,01:19:19.714,Is everything okay?
01:19:19.755,01:19:21.131,What happened to the music?
01:19:21.173,01:19:23.509,The band left.
01:19:24.093,01:19:25.636,Derek fired me.
01:19:25.678,01:19:27.763,"Ah, it's no big deal."
01:19:27.804,01:19:29.557,It's the Catalina Wine Mixer!
01:19:29.599,01:19:31.726,People have killed to be in the position that I'm in.
01:19:31.767,01:19:33.310,"He's right, Dad."
01:19:33.352,01:19:37.314,"ROBERT: Okay, here's a thought: I see an empty stage."
01:19:37.356,01:19:39.983,"I see drums, I see a drummer."
01:19:40.025,01:19:42.570,"I see a microphone, and I see a singer."
01:19:42.612,01:19:44.154,"Dad, come on."
01:19:44.196,01:19:46.198,We gave that stuff up.
01:19:46.240,01:19:49.159,Listen. Listen to me.
01:19:46.240,01:19:52.079,"Dale, look, when I was a kid, when I was a little boy, I always wanted to be a dinosaur."
01:19:52.121,01:19:54.957,I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus rex more than anything in the world.
01:19:54.998,01:20:02.005,"I made my arms short and I roamed the backyard and I chased the neighborhood cats, and I growled and I roared."
01:20:02.047,01:20:04.007,Everybody knew me and was afraid of me.
01:20:04.049,01:20:09.555,"And then one day my dad said, Bobby, you're 17."
01:20:09.597,01:20:11.724,"And I said, Okay, Pop."
01:20:11.766,01:20:15.227,"But he didn't really say that, he said, Stop being a fucking dinosaur and get a job."
01:20:15.269,01:20:22.192,"But, you know, I thought to myself, I'll go to medical school, I'll practice for a little while, and then I'll come back to it."
01:20:22.234,01:20:24.403,DALE: Dad...
01:20:24.445,01:20:25.946,But I forgot how to do it.
01:20:25.988,01:20:27.490,You're human.
01:20:27.531,01:20:29.492,You could never be a dinosaur.
01:20:31.034,01:20:33.412,"Hey, I lost it."
01:20:33.454,01:20:35.414,"Dad, what's the point?"
01:20:35.456,01:20:39.126,The point is don't lose your dinosaur.
01:20:39.168,01:20:41.878,"Yeah. You know, I hated the way you guys were before."
01:20:41.920,01:20:43.255,"I mean, I hated you."
01:20:43.297,01:20:48.260,But it just kills me to see you so crushed and normal.
01:20:48.302,01:20:53.390,"Listen to me, don't listen to me, Prestige Worldwide, that's what you gotta do."
01:20:53.432,01:20:55.601,You're saying we should go for it.
01:20:57.687,01:20:59.730,"What do you think, Brennan?"
01:20:59.772,01:21:02.107,I'm so scared right now.
01:21:02.149,01:21:06.945,I'm gonna file for unemployment and I'm gonna try to get a job at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.
01:21:06.987,01:21:12.909,Because they got a excellent corporate structure and they give you the tools to be your own boss.
01:21:12.951,01:21:15.037,My dad's right.
01:21:15.078,01:21:16.997,This isn't me.
01:21:17.039,01:21:20.083,I'm fucking miserable.
01:21:20.125,01:21:28.509,"And even though I just got a tidal wave of nerves, I'm going up on that stage and I'm gonna make beautiful music for a sad world."
01:21:28.551,01:21:30.845,Dale...
01:21:30.886,01:21:32.179,This crowd's gonna eat him alive.
01:21:36.266,01:21:37.560,"Wait, what's he doing up there?"
01:21:37.601,01:21:40.437,Somebody get him off the fucking stage!
01:21:40.479,01:21:42.064,Hi. How you doing?
01:21:42.105,01:21:45.484,"My name's Dale Doback, and I hope you like to kick it."
01:21:45.526,01:21:46.819,"Oh, go get them, Dale!"
01:21:52.115,01:21:53.158,Stop yelling at him.
01:21:55.160,01:21:56.912,MAN 1: Terrible!
01:21:56.953,01:21:58.581,He's a human being.
01:22:03.669,01:22:05.671,No.
01:22:05.713,01:22:09.299,"My boats and ho's He's up there alone, Brennan."
01:22:11.009,01:22:15.765,My boats and ho's MAN: You suck!
01:22:17.516,01:22:19.268,"NANCY: Brennan, no!"
01:22:21.186,01:22:22.897,What did you do?
01:22:22.938,01:22:26.400,I couldn't stand to see him like that. I miss my son.
01:22:26.442,01:22:29.862,"All right. Let me go for a few bars. Come in soft, but then finish strong."
01:22:29.904,01:22:32.072,"Okay. Hey, Brennan?"
01:22:32.114,01:22:35.659,Thanks for coming up.
01:22:35.701,01:22:36.869,"DALE: Okay, we got a little change coming up."
01:22:37.703,01:22:39.037,It's my main man Brennan.
01:24:45.330,01:24:48.375,"You did it, Derek."
01:24:48.417,01:24:50.794,"Brennan, you're the best big brother ever!"
01:25:00.512,01:25:02.973,...floor mats.
01:25:00.512,01:25:04.516,"The ones that match the seats, and I kind of wanted..."
01:25:04.558,01:25:07.061,I traveled 500 miles to give you my seed.
01:25:07.102,01:25:08.520,Lumberjack!
01:25:49.352,01:25:51.563,"Rock the fuck out of those drums, Dale!"
01:25:51.605,01:25:52.940,I'm sorry.
01:26:34.564,01:26:37.400,We're Prestige Worldwide!
01:26:37.442,01:26:39.277,Fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:26:39.319,01:26:41.905,It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:26:41.947,01:26:43.448,It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
01:26:44.950,01:26:46.284,"Brennan, that was sublime."
01:26:46.326,01:26:48.912,Amazing. We are so proud of you both.
01:26:48.954,01:26:50.622,Thank you.
01:26:50.664,01:26:52.082,Thank you so much.
01:26:52.124,01:26:55.919,So I made my quota.
01:26:55.961,01:26:58.296,That's so good.
01:26:58.338,01:27:06.221,"Look, I'm not great at this Hallmark stuff, but, Brennan, when I look at you now I don't wanna kick you in the head quite as much."
01:27:08.306,01:27:09.975,"Thanks, man."
01:27:10.017,01:27:11.267,That was beautiful.
01:27:11.309,01:27:12.268,Yeah.
01:27:13.937,01:27:16.272,What do we do now?
01:27:16.314,01:27:17.649,"Yeah, you'd like that, faggot."
01:27:21.070,01:27:22.196,Okay.
01:27:35.167,01:27:36.752,It's okay.
01:27:51.225,01:27:52.935,That's what we've been looking for.
01:27:52.976,01:27:54.394,NANCY: That's the ticket.
01:27:54.436,01:27:56.230,ROBERT: It's fantastic.
01:27:56.271,01:27:59.191,"We've never done anything like that before, so you can't expect it to be perfect."
01:27:59.233,01:28:00.776,"It was good, though."
01:28:00.817,01:28:02.903,Felt good.
01:28:02.945,01:28:06.990,"Hello, Brennan. Hi."
01:28:07.032,01:28:09.910,"Robert, Mom, Derek, this is my girlfriend, Denise."
01:28:09.952,01:28:11.703,"Oh, hi. How are you?"
01:28:11.745,01:28:13.371,"Actually, I'm his therapist."
01:28:13.413,01:28:16.625,We are in absolutely no way dating.
01:28:16.666,01:28:25.259,"Brennan told me he was going to hurl his body off a helicopter into shark-infested waters, so I had a legal obligation to be here."
01:28:25.300,01:28:26.927,I get it.
01:28:26.969,01:28:30.931,"Don't wanna appear too eager, and that is a good strategy, too."
01:28:30.973,01:28:33.308,You are an enabler.
01:28:30.973,01:28:34.810,"You think you're helping, but you're not."
01:28:34.851,01:28:36.519,What'd you think?
01:28:38.021,01:28:42.484,"Brennan, I thought you were incredibly brave."
01:28:42.525,01:28:53.369,"And I mean that in strictly the most clinical and professional sense possible, with no emotional, intimate, sexual or any other undertones that you could possibly infer."
01:28:53.411,01:28:55.455,"God, you're gonna make me cry."
01:28:56.832,01:28:59.501,What poem is that from?
01:29:00.210,01:29:01.461,Alice...
01:29:03.297,01:29:05.257,I like making sex with you.
01:29:05.299,01:29:08.593,I do. But you're also married.
01:29:12.388,01:29:15.058,This is crazy. I'm a mother.
01:29:15.100,01:29:16.685,Okay.
01:29:16.726,01:29:19.938,I can't be fucking around with you.
01:29:19.980,01:29:22.816,It was fun while it lasted.
01:29:25.319,01:29:29.572,No.
01:29:29.614,01:29:32.450,Please don't leave me.
01:29:32.492,01:29:33.827,Where?
01:29:37.164,01:29:38.290,Dale!
01:29:44.713,01:29:52.012,"So I was with Seal, and we were just taking a chopper up to Everest base camp, and the plot to my Sherpa..."
01:29:52.054,01:29:53.305,"Derek, shh."
01:29:53.347,01:29:55.182,"Remember, we talked about this."
