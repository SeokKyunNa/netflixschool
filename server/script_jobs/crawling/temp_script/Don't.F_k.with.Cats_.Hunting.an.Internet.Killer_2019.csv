00:39:33.329,00:39:35.373,"So, how do you get your voice so deep?"
00:39:50.930,00:39:53.391,I think he looks good. I'm going to give him a yes.
00:40:04.276,00:40:07.863,"I think you got potential, but I'm gonna ask you to come back next year to the competition."
00:40:09.740,00:40:11.450,It's a tiebreaker.
00:40:11.575,00:40:12.618,"Well, it's up to you."
00:40:27.425,00:40:29.635,I just don't think he's beefy enough for COVERGuy.
00:45:19.425,00:45:23.762,"My modeling career has gone downhill these days, to be honest with you."
00:45:24.555,00:45:28.559,And it's all because of this whole rumor of you dating Karla Homolka?
00:45:28.976,00:45:31.687,"The rumor's destroyed my life, basically, and..."
00:45:31.770,00:45:37.234,I want to set the record straight that me and her have absolutely no connection.
00:45:48.370,00:45:49.913,I've been receiving death threats.
00:45:50.289,00:45:53.083,My address is posted. That's why I had to move.
00:45:53.167,00:45:55.127,I'm about to have a nervous breakdown here.
00:45:55.210,00:45:57.588,My reputation's completely ruined.
00:45:57.671,00:46:00.716,"I go in to see casting directors, I go in to see agents..."
00:46:01.049,00:46:02.384,They know who I am.
00:46:02.468,00:46:04.303,"You know, it's all over everywhere."
00:46:05.053,00:46:06.930,"Whoever's doing this, please stop."
00:58:20.997,00:58:24.834,He could be a fucking loon and try to stab us or something.
00:58:24.918,00:58:26.711,We've got to be a bit careful.
00:58:27.795,00:58:30.215,Luka! Can I have a quick word?
00:58:30.298,00:58:32.634,I'm a journalist from The Sun newspaper.
00:58:34.844,00:58:36.304,"You're not filming me, are you?"
00:58:36.387,00:58:38.973,"No, no. What are you doing in London now?"
00:58:39.474,00:58:40.934,Because of the harassment.
00:58:41.017,00:58:43.603,- What harassment? - I'm getting death threats.
00:58:43.686,00:58:44.604,Saying what?
00:58:44.687,00:58:47.690,Anything you can imagine. They're going to kill me...
00:58:48.316,00:58:50.652,-Why? - Because of these stories.
00:58:50.735,00:58:53.363,But a lot of people are saying that this chap...
00:58:54.280,00:58:57.033,is responsible for killing the kittens in the YouTube videos.
00:58:57.116,00:58:58.910,This is you in the picture here?
00:58:59.410,00:59:01.663,"- No, it's not. - It certainly looks like you."
00:59:01.746,00:59:03.623,- It's not me. - That isn't you?
00:59:03.706,00:59:04.582,No.
00:59:05.750,00:59:08.795,People are really good with Photoshop these days aren't they?
00:59:10.129,00:59:12.298,"People have framed me, isn't that obvious?"
00:59:12.382,00:59:13.925,Why would anybody do that?
00:59:15.134,00:59:17.053,Have they got a vendetta against you?
00:59:17.136,00:59:18.972,Many people do.
00:59:19.055,00:59:22.100,- What for? - We won't get into that.
00:59:22.642,00:59:25.103,"Okay, we're not really getting very far."
00:59:25.186,00:59:29.065,"We'll have to leave it at that, I think. I mean-- Yes, I think we do. Thank you. Have a wonderful day."
00:00:11.845,00:00:12.679,Are you ready?
00:00:14.097,00:00:14.931,Yeah?
00:00:22.230,00:00:23.940,"You know, it's the Wild West, right?"
00:00:25.525,00:00:32.741,"There's the happy places where you look at cute little babies and wonderful, beautiful playfulness, and cute pictures of your kids going to school."
00:00:33.199,00:00:37.454,"But more than anything, people love cats. They love them."
00:00:38.621,00:00:42.667,And then there's another part of the Internet that is a free-for-all.
00:00:42.751,00:00:44.169,The seedy underbelly.
00:00:44.252,00:00:57.515,"You can post porn, violence, somebody getting pushed down stairs, religious statues being defamed, cruelty to the elderly, a street fight, bum fights, defamatory images of the Statue of Liberty, and nobody gives a crap."
00:00:57.932,00:00:58.933,Nobody's gonna bat an eye.
00:01:00.143,00:01:02.937,"But in this seedy underbelly, there's an unwritten rule."
00:01:04.564,00:01:06.691,"Now, it's unwritten, but it's understood."
00:01:08.151,00:01:09.194,Rule zero.
00:01:09.277,00:01:12.363,And rule zero is don't fuck with cats.
00:01:15.909,00:01:22.749,"Good evening. We begin tonight with developing and sinister news, where police are investigating two mysterious packages."
00:01:27.587,00:01:29.798,and it's the first time I've seen something like this.
00:01:33.301,00:01:37.347,A receptionist opened the blood-soaked box and found a severed foot.
00:01:46.523,00:01:48.108,"a very, very well laid-out plan."
00:01:55.990,00:01:58.660,And he actually put things on the Internet.
00:02:02.622,00:02:04.916,There was moments that aren't even speakable.
00:02:06.042,00:02:09.212,"This man does not have a lot of friends. Not many who have surfaced, anyway."
00:02:14.175,00:02:15.927,How dangerous is this man?
00:02:16.010,00:02:18.388,How careful should people be right across the globe?
00:02:25.353,00:02:29.149,Interpol issued a worldwide arrest warrant for first-degree murder.
00:02:32.068,00:02:35.989,that online evidence of a twisted mind was ignored by police.
00:02:39.576,00:02:42.328,of him allegedly torturing and killing cats.
00:03:15.486,00:03:20.575,"Vegas, to me, is not gambling and drinking and hookers and blow."
00:03:20.658,00:03:23.286,"It's not, What stays in Vegas, you know, kind of thing."
00:03:23.369,00:03:24.204,I live here.
00:03:26.414,00:03:28.082,"So, Vegas is work."
00:03:28.708,00:03:35.006,"My name is Deanna Thompson, and I am a data analyst for a large casino here in Las Vegas."
00:03:35.089,00:03:37.967,I'm responsible for all the technology in the gaming industry.
00:03:40.553,00:03:44.557,"Anything to do with slot machines, table games, I have a hand in it."
00:03:50.939,00:03:53.316,I would say I'm textbook definition of a computer nerd.
00:03:53.399,00:03:54.442,"Like, textbook."
00:03:59.072,00:04:01.532,"and spend some time with the dogs, and then, uh..."
00:04:04.702,00:04:06.913,"You know, get on my computers and hit the Internet."
00:04:19.133,00:04:20.426,to hide my identity.
00:04:21.261,00:04:25.056,And Body Movin' is a song from the Beastie Boys.
00:04:28.601,00:04:30.311,-Go on. -No.
00:04:30.436,00:04:32.146,"It's-- No, dude. I can't sing it."
00:04:33.231,00:04:34.065,Shut up.
00:04:35.066,00:04:36.150,I'm not gonna sing it.
00:04:36.234,00:04:38.027,You can play it. Get the rights.
00:04:38.361,00:04:39.737,"I'm not gonna, uh-uh."
00:04:50.498,00:04:52.166,I could make the world a better place.
00:04:52.875,00:04:54.043,I could be funny.
00:04:55.086,00:04:57.297,"You know, I could be really smart."
00:04:57.755,00:04:59.424,I could be a princess.
00:05:05.054,00:05:07.181,I could be anybody I want online.
00:05:24.907,00:05:28.369,"you know, a pretty drastic end, and I was pretty fucked-up about it in the head."
00:05:32.749,00:05:36.711,I just wanted to sink myself into something that would take my mind off of it.
00:05:36.794,00:05:40.340,I could kind of not deal with this bullshit in my life.
00:05:42.592,00:05:52.560,"And so, I was on Facebook one day, and I found a post a lot of people had been feverishly posting about a video that was online."
00:05:57.273,00:05:58.191,I thought...
00:06:00.735,00:06:02.028,Let's go look at this.
00:06:19.128,00:06:22.256,"You know, I'm thinking, Oh, this is a cute video, you know. What's this?"
00:06:32.058,00:06:34.560,"And, um..."
00:06:34.977,00:06:36.562,I've never seen the video...
00:06:36.854,00:06:37.980,"uh, full-on."
00:06:38.064,00:06:42.068,"I've never seen the whole thing. I've watched bits and pieces, but I've never seen the whole video."
00:06:42.151,00:06:43.403,"So, here we go."
00:06:57.458,00:06:58.876,and it's up over his head.
00:06:59.168,00:07:07.009,"It's hiding a lot of his face, but you can see, like, fringy, banged hair, and he's putting them into one of those vacuum-seal bags."
00:07:07.093,00:07:08.553,They suck all the air out.
00:07:11.055,00:07:14.142,"The frame just changed to, uh..."
00:07:16.727,00:07:23.651,"he's attaching a vacuum hose to the area of the bag where the vacuum hose would, you know, kind of seal into."
00:07:24.360,00:07:25.862,One of the kittens sort of...
00:07:26.779,00:07:31.617,"playfully tries to get out of the bag, and he, you know-- That's fucking heartbreaking, dude."
00:07:48.301,00:07:49.218,Just for a minute.
00:07:54.223,00:07:55.808,"I fucking hate this shit, dude."
00:07:57.185,00:07:58.060,So sad.
00:08:04.400,00:08:07.653,"Certainly, I'm emotional. I mean, I love, I love cats."
00:08:07.737,00:08:08.613,I love them.
00:08:10.364,00:08:14.660,"So when I watched this video, I was, like, Dude, this is, like, bullshit."
00:08:15.077,00:08:17.622,There's prices to pay. There's consequences for your actions.
00:08:19.832,00:08:22.752,"So, I wasn't the only one that was totally outraged by this video."
00:08:22.835,00:08:28.424,"The comments under the video were, I can't believe this motherfucker's doing this, and, Who the fuck is this guy?"
00:08:29.842,00:08:31.093,Fuck this guy.
00:08:31.552,00:08:33.679,"You know, Who is this bastard? Let's kill him."
00:08:33.763,00:08:36.807,"It was outrage. Just boom, boom, boom, boom."
00:08:39.268,00:08:41.062,"Oh, my God. You're gonna go to jail."
00:08:41.145,00:08:43.523,"And I'm thinking to myself, What the fuck is this?"
00:08:45.858,00:08:48.110,"Yeah, this is an emotional thing, for sure."
00:08:48.194,00:08:49.320,"You're angry, I get it."
00:08:51.447,00:08:52.907,But who the fuck are you gonna call?
00:08:54.534,00:08:56.577,"Okay, what police department are you gonna call?"
00:08:56.661,00:08:59.705,"You don't know where this happened. You know, this person could live in..."
00:08:59.956,00:09:01.749,"you know, Siberia for all I know."
00:09:05.836,00:09:08.881,"We don't have jurisdiction, so it's just noise."
00:09:14.053,00:09:17.974,"But in the comments, there was a Facebook link, and I clicked it, and it took me to a Facebook group..."
00:09:27.900,00:09:30.903,And it looked to me like it was focused on trying to find...
00:09:31.612,00:09:32.780,who was in this video.
00:09:37.451,00:09:39.912,"In the group, I did observe one..."
00:09:40.705,00:09:46.711,"persona who was sticking to facts, wasn't getting emotional, and that was John Green."
00:10:10.985,00:10:11.861,I'm ready.
00:10:21.454,00:10:30.171,"What type of individual would think, I'm going to take a vacuum-sealed bag and place two kittens in it?"
00:10:45.603,00:10:51.734,"And he had made a comment that said, All haters can suck my huge dick, LOL."
00:10:52.318,00:10:55.905,And... it was a very interesting comment to make.
00:10:55.988,00:10:59.408,"Um, I don't know why you would tell people to do that to you."
00:11:00.826,00:11:08.793,"And when I clicked on the profile, I noticed that they had also liked a video for the movie..."
00:11:09.543,00:11:10.670,Catch Me If You Can.
00:11:14.048,00:11:17.009,You're gonna get caught. It's like Vegas. The house always wins.
00:11:22.556,00:11:27.061,and an FBI agent goes around trying to track him down across the country to catch him.
00:11:28.229,00:11:31.565,"Which, to me, I took as a big, Hey, you're never gonna catch me."
00:11:31.649,00:11:32.775,Ha-ha-ha. Fuck you.
00:11:36.112,00:11:37.780,I'm throwing down the gauntlet.
00:11:37.863,00:11:38.864,I dare you.
00:11:38.948,00:11:41.534,I challenge you to try and find out who I am.
00:11:41.617,00:11:47.248,"I was like, Oh, okay, this person wants to play a game of cat and mouse, and I'm up for that."
00:11:52.920,00:11:54.880,they decided to actually find who this person was.
00:11:57.925,00:12:02.012,So I felt super empowered by just watching all this happen.
00:12:03.556,00:12:17.862,"But they were focusing on the person, which I thought was totally fucking weird because you can't find a person, but you can find objects in the room that would tell you where this person is."
00:12:20.531,00:12:24.118,"It looks like a very small, cramped room."
00:12:25.995,00:12:29.331,"I mean, you're talking like maybe eight feet by ten feet wide."
00:12:30.332,00:12:32.918,"But for me, there's a lot of information in there."
00:12:33.002,00:12:34.920,"You see a door, a bed..."
00:12:35.713,00:12:36.630,a table...
00:12:38.549,00:12:43.971,"You see a door handle, a light socket, electrical receptacles."
00:12:47.516,00:12:53.022,"And those are things that we know can point to, like, maybe a specific area of the world."
00:12:54.523,00:12:59.403,Wall sockets in England are different than they are in California.
00:13:01.030,00:13:02.323,We picked apart...
00:13:03.908,00:13:05.576,every little thing in that room.
00:13:08.746,00:13:13.250,"Then I created a schematic, or diagram, of the layout of the room..."
00:13:14.460,00:13:16.754,so everybody understood what each thing was.
00:13:21.050,00:13:23.719,This wolf bedspread was hideous...
00:13:23.928,00:13:25.054,and it was super unique.
00:13:25.137,00:13:29.767,"Some of the wolf blankets out there, you got two wolves howling at the moon or, you know, something cheesy."
00:13:29.850,00:13:31.143,This one was just a wolf head.
00:13:31.936,00:13:36.190,"And it was sold on eBay, made by a company in North America."
00:13:36.690,00:13:42.321,"It only had one buyer, and we couldn't see who that buyer was."
00:13:45.282,00:13:46.742,But shipped internationally.
00:13:50.621,00:13:51.622,Didn't help us at all.
00:13:52.957,00:13:55.042,He could have been anywhere on the planet.
00:14:06.846,00:14:11.559,"You start realizing, like, Oh, there's somebody else in the room, but you don't see him on camera."
00:14:11.642,00:14:14.770,And they're kind of giggling and talking.
00:14:15.104,00:14:17.648,And we didn't know what language it was.
00:14:22.361,00:14:23.445,"I mean, it sounded..."
00:14:24.029,00:14:27.116,"Eastern Bloc, but, you know, I'm not a language expert."
00:14:37.167,00:14:41.380,"She was born in the Ukraine, and she recognized it immediately. It was Russian."
00:14:48.053,00:14:51.307,Oh! Maybe it's possible he's located in Russia.
00:15:06.030,00:15:08.032,...there's a lot of things that you can pick up.
00:15:10.451,00:15:12.995,It's kind of staticky. It's a little staticky.
00:15:13.579,00:15:16.540,"And they're chatting, laughing, and they're making a lot of noise."
00:15:19.251,00:15:20.878,"And then all of a sudden, it stops."
00:15:20.961,00:15:22.546,"And they, like, disappear."
00:15:22.796,00:15:27.593,Okay? It just-- Almost like they left the room without making a sound.
00:15:28.552,00:15:30.554,But you can kind of hear a click.
00:15:35.184,00:15:36.644,Click. It stops.
00:15:40.522,00:15:42.316,Fuck. This is a recording.
00:15:42.399,00:15:43.609,God damn it.
00:15:43.692,00:15:48.364,"We actually found out it was a Russian sitcom, and we actually found the episode."
00:15:54.453,00:15:56.830,This person is playing games with us.
00:15:56.914,00:15:58.582,He's trying to mislead us.
00:15:58.666,00:16:01.835,We spent weeks on this Russian bullshit.
00:16:02.336,00:16:03.170,I spent...
00:16:05.464,00:16:08.926,16 hours looking at fucking doorknobs from Lithuania.
00:16:32.658,00:16:34.702,I made a promise I was gonna track him down.
00:16:34.785,00:16:36.036,I'm still gonna do it.
00:16:38.831,00:16:39.790,All of a sudden...
00:16:40.958,00:16:42.960,another video appears.
00:17:09.111,00:17:13.032,And he's playing with the cats who are now deceased.
00:17:14.033,00:17:16.076,Definitely after the act.
00:17:21.957,00:17:25.252,"Along with the video, he also released a couple pictures."
00:17:27.546,00:17:29.631,And the group also get...
00:17:30.632,00:17:31.550,a link.
00:17:32.426,00:17:35.345,But from an obvious fake profile.
00:17:36.513,00:17:38.515,It's what we call a sock puppet account.
00:17:38.682,00:17:40.809,They're usually very easy to recognize.
00:17:45.355,00:17:51.153,"It's usually, like, a super generic name, with a super generic profile picture."
00:17:53.655,00:17:55.157,They will post something...
00:17:57.451,00:17:58.994,and then delete that account.
00:18:00.454,00:18:01.997,"So, I clicked on the link."
00:18:02.873,00:18:13.092,"And there, in all of his glory, was a picture of the guy holding the cats, but he had blurred his face out."
00:18:13.550,00:18:17.805,This was so important because it gave us some insight into who he was.
00:18:18.347,00:18:20.224,Maybe he wants to be chased a little bit.
00:18:22.351,00:18:25.270,"It's almost like he was saying, What the fuck? Are you guys stupid?"
00:18:25.354,00:18:28.816,I'm gonna throw you this bone and see how you gnaw on it for a little while.
00:18:29.608,00:18:33.445,But the second thing it showed us was that he was following the investigation.
00:18:36.615,00:18:38.283,He had infiltrated the group.
00:18:38.951,00:18:41.161,"Okay, so this is one account that he's using."
00:18:41.245,00:18:42.996,What other accounts is he using?
00:18:49.086,00:18:54.258,"and I didn't put any of my personal information, I wasn't necessarily concerned for my own safety."
00:18:57.052,00:19:02.349,"But for some of my other group members, they had some serious concerns for their own safety."
00:19:12.151,00:19:18.615,"and started playing with these dead cats and shit, but the good part about it was that we had more evidence now."
00:19:19.032,00:19:24.538,"We had more objects to look at in the room, that would help narrow our search to a specific area of the world."
00:19:25.122,00:19:26.165,We were fired up.
00:19:28.542,00:19:36.633,"So, there's frames in the video that you don't really get to see it in the movie that much 'cause it's so fast, but when there's an image of it, it stands out."
00:19:40.846,00:19:49.688,So we dumped all the video frames to images so that we could start looking at this fucking room.
00:19:51.523,00:19:53.775,Tens of thousands of frames that it had.
00:19:56.528,00:19:58.488,"Holy shit, that's a pack of cigarettes."
00:20:00.908,00:20:07.789,"That pack of cigarettes was totally new. And if you know anything about cigarettes, they're different everywhere."
00:20:15.255,00:20:22.012,"You know, cigarettes in a certain area of the world might be, like, long, and skinny, and all 20 of them are in this long, skinny box."
00:20:22.095,00:20:25.349,"You know, some cigarettes are usually, you know, a rectangle."
00:20:25.432,00:20:30.896,"And they have different verbiage required by law 'cause cigarettes can kill you, right?"
00:20:34.858,00:20:38.195,It had the surgeon general warning on these cigarettes.
00:20:39.404,00:20:41.490,The surgeon general is the United States.
00:20:42.783,00:20:45.118,So I knew they were North American cigarettes.
00:20:45.577,00:20:56.713,"This was a huge piece of evidence. Now, it doesn't necessarily mean that the person didn't buy a pack of cigarettes and then hop on a plane to Paris, or, you know, Berlin, but I knew they were North American cigarettes."
00:21:07.099,00:21:08.684,"First thing, yellow vacuum."
00:21:09.518,00:21:11.144,"Okay, there's tons of them."
00:21:19.528,00:21:24.032,One thing that I learned in all of this is that there's an Internet forum for everything out there.
00:21:24.116,00:21:26.743,Are you into vacuums? There's gonna be an Internet forum for it.
00:21:28.912,00:21:31.415,"So, I found this vacuum cleaner repair forum."
00:21:35.252,00:21:39.172,"Thousands of people post, I've got this tube. I'll send it to you."
00:21:39.256,00:21:41.341,"You know, I've got this hose. I can send it to you."
00:21:41.425,00:21:45.053,"So, I posted to this vacuum forum, Hey, guys..."
00:21:55.355,00:21:57.024,They identified it immediately.
00:21:58.734,00:22:05.240,"The Kenmore Canister cleaner, the Aspiradora model, 7-21-26-08-2."
00:22:08.201,00:22:10.620,"Awesome. Guys, thank you so much."
00:22:11.079,00:22:13.290,You've been so great to me. I can't appreciate it enough.
00:22:15.792,00:22:21.506,"Oh, you're welcome, sweetheart. Hey, and just so you know, that's only sold in North America."
00:22:24.801,00:22:25.969,"So, this is it."
00:22:26.636,00:22:37.773,"So, whoever made this fucking video, whoever this guy was, we knew that we could start looking in Mexico, the United States, or Canada."
00:22:38.857,00:22:44.321,"But just when you think shit can't get crazier, it does."
00:23:02.964,00:23:07.469,one group of former street guys formed a rescue organization like no other...
00:23:08.553,00:23:09.930,...by saving animals.
00:23:10.764,00:23:13.183,You pick on the animals because they don't fight back!
00:23:25.821,00:23:30.158,"Rescue Ink. You want the clean version, or you want the real version?"
00:23:30.784,00:23:34.162,"Uh, Rescue Ink is an in-your-face approach to animal abuse, neglect."
00:23:34.246,00:23:39.835,"We do whatever is necessary, within the means of the law, to rescue animals out of bad situations."
00:23:41.753,00:23:44.631,Well... you gotta let your imagination run.
00:24:02.315,00:24:13.994,"When I first watched the video, and I saw the air coming out of the bag, and I saw the life going out of the kittens' eyes, you know, it's something that, you know... It's... it..."
00:24:14.077,00:24:17.998,You-- It made me so anxious to do something.
00:24:18.081,00:24:25.130,"Like, I wanted to try to, you know, like, go in the screen and try to do something, but there's, you know, that helpless feeling you have?"
00:24:25.505,00:24:28.133,It was horrendous. It was horrendous.
00:24:30.760,00:24:36.975,"So I called my sister because my sister's a psychologist, and she studied criminal profiling."
00:24:39.436,00:24:42.355,"She said, This person is doing this for shock value."
00:24:42.439,00:24:45.066,This person is a person that needs a lot of attention.
00:24:45.150,00:24:50.739,"This isn't the first time, it's not gonna be the last time, and this is gonna get progressively worse."
00:24:52.282,00:25:04.377,"They practice on animals, and when they can't feed that sickness inside, or they can't get that excitement anymore, they move on to something else they deem to be helpless, which is usually a small woman, a child, or an elderly person."
00:25:08.924,00:25:10.425,These are the things.
00:25:11.801,00:25:13.386,The telltale sign...
00:25:14.721,00:25:21.269,"of somebody that's gonna become a serial killer, somebody that needs to be stopped immediately."
00:25:39.329,00:25:42.666,"We had a humongous Internet presence on Facebook, on Twitter."
00:25:42.749,00:25:44.793,"We had literally 100,000 people."
00:25:44.876,00:25:47.546,"We were getting eight, nine million hits a month."
00:25:47.629,00:25:53.843,"So, I, you know, got my computer, I went on, I made a poster with a reward on it for $5,000."
00:25:53.927,00:25:56.972,"On one hand, it was like, Okay, cool. This is finally getting some attention."
00:25:57.055,00:25:58.640,"And on the other hand, it was like..."
00:26:05.522,00:26:08.233,"This is every Internet nerd's dream, right?"
00:26:10.610,00:26:13.071,It's an explosion of people...
00:26:14.698,00:26:16.199,now joining this group.
00:26:18.076,00:26:20.495,Everybody started coming on there. Now you had...
00:26:20.579,00:26:26.042,"detectives, private detectives, guys claiming to be private detectives, guys claiming to be Superman, whatever."
00:26:30.463,00:26:33.133,We have CGI rendering kind of experts.
00:26:39.848,00:26:41.016,looking to find this guy.
00:26:41.099,00:26:43.310,Many of them just started posting profiles...
00:26:45.979,00:26:47.314,from anywhere on the planet.
00:26:47.397,00:26:50.233,There was a tidal wave of leads that were coming in.
00:26:51.026,00:26:53.820,"This guy has, you know, fringy kind of hair."
00:26:56.573,00:26:57.949,This guy's tall and lanky.
00:26:58.033,00:27:00.785,"Oh, I think it's this person. Oh, no, it might be this person."
00:27:00.869,00:27:01.870,This dude's wearing a hoodie.
00:27:06.374,00:27:11.087,We're like dogs chasing shiny cars all over the place trying to find this guy.
00:27:16.676,00:27:18.470,It was chaos...
00:27:19.054,00:27:20.430,on the tenth power.
00:27:31.691,00:27:35.403,Someone posted something on Facebook that got a lot of attention.
00:27:38.114,00:27:41.034,"So, it was this guy, Jamsey Cramsalot Inhisass."
00:27:41.826,00:27:44.245,"I don't know how he came up with this frigging name, but..."
00:27:45.121,00:27:47.040,The main thing about this one guy...
00:27:48.041,00:27:54.839,"is that, on his page, he posted a video of a kitten being burned alive in a cage."
00:28:00.929,00:28:05.684,"So, right there, we were like, Okay, this very well could be the guy."
00:28:08.728,00:28:14.025,And his profile picture resembled the guy in the video.
00:28:20.490,00:28:24.202,was very similar looking to the perpetrator of the video.
00:28:24.285,00:28:25.245,It really stood out.
00:28:25.328,00:28:26.162,"It, you know..."
00:28:26.246,00:28:29.040,It looked like maybe this could be something.
00:28:31.418,00:28:33.837,My sister knows me when I get upset. I'm getting very upset.
00:28:33.920,00:28:35.463,"She's like, You gotta calm down."
00:28:35.547,00:28:36.381,"She goes, Listen."
00:28:37.882,00:28:39.968,This type of person craves attention.
00:28:40.552,00:28:43.513,What would happen if we just ask the guy if he did it?
00:28:43.930,00:28:46.975,"I said, Wow, that's a good idea."
00:29:01.656,00:29:03.992,"So, we're just trying to reel him in nice and easy."
00:29:06.369,00:29:08.079,"But eventually, it worked."
00:29:11.499,00:29:12.459,A confession.
00:29:13.877,00:29:16.129,"Yes, I kill kittens, laugh out loud."
00:29:16.212,00:29:18.381,"You know, And there's nothing you can do about it."
00:29:20.258,00:29:21.718,Cramsalot did it.
00:29:21.801,00:29:24.179,This is the right person. We got him.
00:29:25.346,00:29:28.600,The announcement that the admins made were fireworks.
00:29:28.683,00:29:30.810,I'm not kidding you. It was a picture of fireworks.
00:29:52.248,00:29:56.795,So they start looking at his friends online because that would give them a location.
00:30:00.423,00:30:04.427,And they found a town called Windhoek in Namibia...
00:30:04.511,00:30:07.597,"I can't pronounce it, in Southern Africa."
00:30:32.455,00:30:36.876,"had really all come together and said, Hey, guys. We found him. This is the kitten killer. We got it."
00:30:38.586,00:30:40.922,John Green and I were sitting there and kind of going...
00:30:42.799,00:30:43.716,What?
00:30:47.136,00:30:50.598,It didn't make any sense because everything pointed to North America.
00:30:51.683,00:30:55.270,"I mean, everything. We had the cigarettes, we had the wolf blanket, we had the vacuum."
00:30:55.353,00:31:00.024,And you're telling me that some guy in a country I can't even pronounce...
00:31:00.108,00:31:02.694,Got it? I don't understand. How did you get there?
00:31:03.945,00:31:07.115,"So we start looking, Okay, well, who's the guy in the picture?"
00:31:11.870,00:31:22.422,"the Jamsey Cramsalot Inhisass Facebook profile, do a reverse image search, and it'll show you where that image has been posted before."
00:31:25.967,00:31:30.638,"And from there, we were able to find the website that the picture was actually posted to initially."
00:31:31.806,00:31:33.516,But it was kind of a male...
00:31:34.434,00:31:35.810,pornography website.
00:31:40.940,00:31:44.193,So we're scrolling through all these pictures...
00:31:45.361,00:31:49.157,"you know, next, next, next, and boom."
00:31:50.241,00:31:52.368,We find a picture of...
00:31:52.744,00:31:55.663,the one that Jamsey's using without the Santa hat.
00:31:57.123,00:32:04.047,So we knew that Jamsey had appropriated that image and added a Santa hat...
00:32:04.881,00:32:06.382,for his profile picture.
00:32:06.925,00:32:09.552,"So we knew, Fuck, this isn't the kitten killer."
00:32:17.727,00:32:24.442,"So we approached the Facebook group and said, Hey, you know, it can't be the killer. Like, this cannot be him."
00:32:29.447,00:32:31.491,And they dug their heels in.
00:32:31.574,00:32:33.451,"Nope, this is the guy. This is it."
00:32:34.035,00:32:35.453,We're gonna get this guy.
00:32:43.962,00:32:45.338,Absolutely dumbfounded.
00:32:45.838,00:32:47.048,They wanted to be right.
00:32:49.717,00:32:52.762,And this Facebook group lynched him.
00:33:00.311,00:33:03.189,"People are out for blood, you know, when this kind of thing happens."
00:33:06.025,00:33:08.403,Emotions can get the better of you.
00:33:09.028,00:33:12.156,Your inner fire is just... argh!
00:33:26.004,00:33:28.172,had actually taken his own life.
00:33:35.638,00:33:39.058,Somebody had made the discovery of the real person's identity.
00:33:39.434,00:33:41.436,His name was Edward Jordan.
00:33:57.326,00:33:58.161,You know...
00:33:58.786,00:34:08.254,he was an Internet troll that wanted to be like a copycat that put up a video that made everybody think he was the guy.
00:34:14.302,00:34:15.511,with major depression.
00:34:16.846,00:34:22.101,"Spent a lot of time online dealing with that and avoiding the depression, and I know all about that."
00:34:22.185,00:34:23.061,I've done it myself.
00:34:26.064,00:34:32.987,"Nobody knows, and I'm not certainly saying that he killed himself because of this witch hunt against him."
00:34:34.781,00:34:39.619,But you do have to be careful because you don't know who's on the other end of the computer...
00:34:40.536,00:34:42.997,and what kind of mental problems they might have.
00:34:51.297,00:34:53.633,you gotta fight against losing yourself.
00:34:56.010,00:35:00.807,What happens is you start to turn into the very thing that you're trying to fight.
00:35:03.142,00:35:06.187,"You don't want to become like these people, vicious."
00:35:07.188,00:35:09.190,You don't want to become the monster.
00:35:17.406,00:35:23.454,"And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, some of our group members receive a message."
00:35:24.956,00:35:26.666,And this is another sock puppet account.
00:35:26.749,00:35:27.917,We don't know who it is.
00:35:30.086,00:35:36.008,"And the message said, uh, you know, The person you're looking for, his name is Luka Magnotta."
00:35:37.718,00:35:40.972,"And, you know, we're like, Who the fuck is Luka Magnotta?"
00:35:41.973,00:35:45.560,Luka Magnotta? That sounds like a fake porn star name.
00:35:45.643,00:35:46.769,This can't be real.
00:35:46.853,00:35:49.689,"Like, this is another, you know... Somebody's fucking with us."
00:35:50.106,00:35:51.732,"Of course, what you gonna do?"
00:35:51.816,00:35:53.693,"Luka Magnotta, hit Enter."
00:35:54.152,00:35:58.197,"And, oh, my God, it just, like... He just..."
00:36:00.783,00:36:06.372,There-- I don't know how to explain my reaction to what the results were.
00:36:11.294,00:36:14.839,There's just hundreds and hundreds of search results.
00:36:18.843,00:36:22.889,"set to New Order's True Faith, and it was just like a slide show..."
00:36:26.100,00:36:27.810,...of this guy posing.
00:36:30.855,00:36:34.150,"And I'm looking through them, and I'm going, What is this?"
00:36:34.233,00:36:36.861,And I'm reading about this person who lives this...
00:36:37.695,00:36:39.488,jet-setting lifestyle.
00:36:42.700,00:36:44.869,"There were pictures of him in, I think, Sweden."
00:36:44.952,00:36:52.376,"The Red Square in Russia, Eiffel Tower, the Trevi Fountain in Rome, Miami."
00:36:52.460,00:36:55.379,I couldn't believe how many pictures there were of this person.
00:36:56.631,00:37:00.259,We found hundreds and hundreds of fan sites.
00:37:02.637,00:37:05.556,And a lot of the comments said really flattering things about him.
00:37:12.855,00:37:17.443,There were story after story after story about Luka online.
00:37:17.526,00:37:23.199,"There were stories about him being a model, Luka Magnotta was a long-lost cousin of River Phoenix."
00:37:23.658,00:37:26.035,"I mean, we were blown away by this."
00:37:31.415,00:37:33.751,There were stories that he was dating Madonna.
00:37:33.834,00:37:36.504,"I mean, I was just like, What the--?"
00:37:36.671,00:37:40.341,"At this point, I'm starting to be like, Dude."
00:37:40.633,00:37:44.262,"Okay, I've never heard of this guy, and he's dating Madonna?"
00:37:54.105,00:37:56.357,"He had, like, the floppy, brown hair."
00:37:56.440,00:37:59.110,He had a very similar bone structure to the profile.
00:37:59.777,00:38:11.163,"But given the group's history of accusing the wrong people, I was very hesitant to start ringing the alarm bells and start talking to the group publicly about who this person was yet."
00:38:16.877,00:38:19.630,and asked some people that we trust to join it.
00:38:22.008,00:38:24.802,they were pragmatic. And it was called Luka_Intel.
00:38:26.637,00:38:30.099,But the problem that we ran into was that we still didn't know where he was.
00:38:31.350,00:38:33.811,We had pictures of him all over the world.
00:38:34.854,00:38:36.897,But we don't know where he's at today.
00:38:38.858,00:38:47.366,But we eventually found a video of an audition tape that he had made three years prior for a reality TV show about male models.
00:38:50.369,00:38:51.829,"Hi, my name is Luka."
00:38:52.413,00:38:55.666,"Magnotta's my last name, M-A-G-N-O-T-T-A."
00:38:58.210,00:38:59.420,"Good, how are you?"
00:39:04.842,00:39:06.177,Okay. Ding.
00:39:09.347,00:39:10.639,"All right, definitely."
00:39:14.352,00:39:17.521,"I have a very deep voice. A lot of people tell me that, actually."
00:39:26.072,00:39:31.660,a piece of information we had found that identified the person as being in Canada.
00:39:35.456,00:39:38.584,"How do I get my voice so deep? Practice makes perfect, right?"
00:39:39.502,00:39:46.967,"He had his jacket over him, and he was standing like this, and... Hi, my name is Luka, you know, doing his thing. And he's very, very vain."
00:39:47.301,00:39:50.846,"A lot of people tell me I'm really devastatingly good-looking, so..."
00:39:56.227,00:39:59.105,"you know, Could this be somebody who really films himself..."
00:40:00.231,00:40:03.734,putting cats into a vacuum bag and sucking air out until they suffocate?
00:40:07.947,00:40:09.657,-Okay. All right. -All right?
00:40:15.121,00:40:22.253,"in that frame of mind and say, Could I be a normal person, myself, Deanna, and then one day just be a person that kills cats?"
00:40:22.670,00:40:27.341,"And as you're watching this seemingly normal dude, your mind-- It's hard to go there."
00:40:29.718,00:40:31.637,I can gain muscle. Everybody can do it.
00:40:31.720,00:40:33.347,"You know, I can gain muscle, I can work out."
00:40:33.431,00:40:38.102,"I'm very determined, and every goal that I've put my mind to, I've surpassed."
00:40:40.563,00:40:42.898,"Nah, this can't be the same guy. This can't be the same guy."
00:40:45.234,00:40:49.697,"But then I got a message from John Green, and the message said..."
00:40:50.364,00:40:53.367,You can't always take photos as the truth.
00:40:54.869,00:41:00.291,"Looking at photos of this Luka person, you start noticing a pattern in them."
00:41:01.250,00:41:03.502,"You start noticing, like, Well, wait a minute."
00:41:03.586,00:41:06.672,that face doesn't appear to match with that body.
00:41:12.219,00:41:15.306,His skin tone didn't match his body.
00:41:18.642,00:41:22.271,and things where they'd been edited or didn't line up correctly.
00:41:29.028,00:41:32.531,And there's this post talking about how he just married this girl in Russia.
00:41:32.615,00:41:35.284,And one of our group members found the original photo.
00:41:41.373,00:41:48.214,had taken Luka Magnotta's head and put them on random people that he found on the Internet...
00:41:50.049,00:41:51.175,to make it look...
00:41:52.426,00:41:54.803,like he was out there having a grand old time.
00:41:57.640,00:42:03.270,"And over time, when you look at 20, 30, 40 of these fan sites, the comments..."
00:42:03.395,00:42:06.941,"They're all different accounts, but they all say the same thing."
00:42:10.611,00:42:16.742,"They were all different usernames, but it was the same verbiage, the same phrasing, the same style of writing."
00:42:17.326,00:42:19.036,"And you start wondering, Okay..."
00:42:19.620,00:42:22.206,is this all from the same person?
00:42:27.753,00:42:37.012,It started to really look like all these fan sites that were created for Luka as dedication websites all seem to be created by Luka himself.
00:42:45.062,00:42:50.025,"So now I'm thinking, I don't know if everything that's out there about him is fake."
00:42:54.655,00:43:03.706,"But we eventually found an article written in the Toronto Sun, which is kind of like a tabloidy kind of gossipy rag, um, by a guy named Joe Warmington."
00:43:15.301,00:43:20.514,"I was on my way home from work, when I was listening to a popular radio program."
00:43:28.981,00:43:31.275,that was calling in to this radio show.
00:43:31.650,00:43:41.243,"And what he was upset about was the fact that, he said, on the Internet, people were linking him romantically with Karla Homolka."
00:43:42.036,00:43:51.003,"Now, if you say the name Karla Homolka here in Canada, that will get the hair on the back of your neck standing up..."
00:43:51.712,00:43:54.465,because she is the most hated woman in Canada.
00:43:57.343,00:44:00.888,"She is the wife of a serial killer, Paul Bernardo."
00:44:01.138,00:44:03.307,They're known as the Ken and Barbie killers.
00:44:05.142,00:44:10.814,"She was involved in the murders of three young girls, all 14, and one of them was her sister."
00:44:12.024,00:44:16.904,"And they had made a deal with her, for immunity, to testify against her husband."
00:44:17.446,00:44:21.825,"Later, video showed that she was very much involved in this."
00:44:21.909,00:44:24.662,"In fact, she led it, and some of these murders were her idea."
00:44:25.621,00:44:27.373,And this caller was very frantic.
00:44:28.415,00:44:31.794,"And I'm thinking, Who is this? And then finally, he said his name."
00:44:32.336,00:44:33.545,Luka Magnotta.
00:44:36.507,00:44:42.930,"I reached out through an e-mail, and, out of nowhere, I get a call from this guy saying, Hello, it's Luka Magnotta."
00:44:44.014,00:44:48.811,"I said it would be good to meet in person, and he had offered to meet me somewhere."
00:44:48.894,00:44:50.229,I can't remember where.
00:44:50.896,00:44:52.272,"But I just thought, You know what?"
00:44:52.356,00:44:56.652,"It might be better if he'd meet us at the Sun newsroom, which he agreed to."
00:44:59.113,00:45:01.865,"Knowing what I know now, that was the right decision."
00:45:03.617,00:45:07.788,"I remember sitting there, and in walks Luka Magnotta."
00:45:09.998,00:45:17.172,And my mouth opened and my jaw dropped to the floor because this guy looked like Paul Bernardo.
00:45:37.317,00:45:47.494,"He was very emphatic about the fact that his life was spinning out of control, and it was not only costing him work, but it was, you know, a real threat to his life."
00:46:11.059,00:46:12.019,dating Karla Homolka.
00:46:12.102,00:46:13.061,That's it.
00:46:17.983,00:46:26.533,I've been receiving death threats-- I started to believe that he used his sock puppet accounts to start creating these rumors himself.
00:46:29.161,00:46:31.872,"Like, why would you want to associate with a serial killer?"
00:46:32.456,00:46:34.875,Me and her have absolutely no connection.
00:46:37.002,00:46:38.337,For fame. One hundred percent.
00:46:39.755,00:46:43.300,Remember rule zero: don't fuck with cats.
00:46:43.592,00:46:51.683,It really started to make me think his motivation behind doing it was the attention and the fame that he knew he would get from it.
00:46:52.226,00:46:53.185,And he got it.
00:47:04.988,00:47:06.406,to the cat killing videos.
00:47:08.784,00:47:10.410,We still didn't know where he was.
00:47:17.668,00:47:19.920,He could have been anywhere on the planet.
00:47:20.003,00:47:21.463,So where do we start looking?
00:47:22.923,00:47:27.219,So we went through every picture that we could.
00:47:28.262,00:47:33.684,Thousands and thousands of photos because we knew he would have fucked up at least one of them.
00:47:34.184,00:47:36.103,That he would leave a digital footprint.
00:47:36.854,00:47:43.360,"So sometimes, when you take a picture, there's digital information stored in the picture."
00:47:44.152,00:47:45.571,And it's called EXIF data.
00:47:46.029,00:47:52.286,"You know the model of the camera that took the photo, the date the photo was taken, the GPS location of the photo..."
00:47:52.703,00:47:57.291,You can take a photo and upload it to a website that will show you all the EXIF data.
00:47:58.000,00:47:59.751,So that's exactly what we did.
00:48:21.440,00:48:24.943,"And it was me, this time, and I'm like, Holy shit."
00:48:25.027,00:48:27.112,"I took a screenshot of it, sent it to John Green."
00:48:27.821,00:48:32.951,The photo in question has Luka sitting on a beautiful chaise lounge.
00:48:33.577,00:48:35.621,It looks to be a fancy department store.
00:48:36.038,00:48:40.292,"And automatically, on the EXIF site, it gives you a map, and it puts a pinpoint."
00:48:43.045,00:48:46.673,And it took me to the Toronto Eaton Shopping Centre.
00:48:47.758,00:48:49.176,"Toronto, Canada."
00:48:56.058,00:48:58.685,"October 25, 2010."
00:48:59.519,00:49:05.442,"So, at the end of October 25th, he's in Toronto, and then the kitten killer video happens in November."
00:49:05.525,00:49:08.946,"So we were, like, freaking out, Oh, my God, he's in Toronto."
00:49:09.947,00:49:14.993,"We thought he might be in Canada, but now we fucking know he's there. He's there, he's there, he's there."
00:49:18.956,00:49:21.458,I'm gonna find his actual address.
00:49:24.544,00:49:31.343,"I found a picture of Luka, and he's standing on a balcony. It's like the third or fourth floor of, like, an apartment or a condo."
00:49:32.552,00:49:36.807,But what I really noticed was at the corner of the intersection was a gas station.
00:49:37.641,00:49:40.185,And the gas station was called Petro-Canada.
00:49:41.645,00:49:44.398,So the first thing I do is I jump on Google Maps.
00:49:48.986,00:49:52.906,"And literally, there's hundreds of Petro-Canada gas stations."
00:49:55.492,00:50:04.418,"But I start cross-referencing things, and I remembered Luka made this blog post talking about how the paparazzi was harassing him."
00:50:04.501,00:50:09.256,"They were trying to take his picture outside his condo in Etobicoke, Canada."
00:50:09.631,00:50:12.509,Etobicoke. That's interesting. Where's that?
00:50:13.051,00:50:16.805,Etobicoke is a suburb outside of Toronto.
00:50:17.139,00:50:20.058,I wonder how many Petro-Canadas there are in Etobicoke.
00:50:20.767,00:50:21.685,Six.
00:50:22.019,00:50:23.687,"Well, this is gonna be easy."
00:50:29.151,00:50:33.905,So I literally start clicking on each of the six Petro-Canada gas stations.
00:50:33.989,00:50:36.033,"When I click on it, I go to the Street View."
00:50:36.116,00:50:38.410,"And I look at it, and I go, Nope. That's not it."
00:50:38.493,00:50:39.745,"Number two, Street View."
00:50:39.828,00:50:42.164,"Nope, that's not it. Number three, click."
00:50:49.713,00:50:50.547,Oh.
00:50:50.714,00:50:56.762,"That looks exactly like the Petro-Canada gas station that I see in the photo of Luka, and guess what?"
00:50:58.430,00:51:02.309,That large gray cement apartment building is directly behind it.
00:51:06.354,00:51:13.195,"So then I take my cursor, and I click on it, and I rotate the Street View 180 degrees."
00:51:16.031,00:51:21.078,And I'm looking directly at the apartment that Luka's seen in in the photo.
00:51:25.248,00:51:27.250,304 Mill Street.
00:51:29.920,00:51:30.754,So now...
00:51:32.714,00:51:33.965,I've got this fucker.
00:51:38.136,00:51:40.555,"So now, we think it's time to go to the authorities."
00:51:40.639,00:51:43.183,So I reach out to the Toronto Police Department.
00:51:43.475,00:51:47.187,"And they were like, What is this about? Videos on the Internet?"
00:51:47.938,00:51:51.274,It took me a while to convince them that what I'm saying is true.
00:51:52.442,00:51:55.612,And they actually went out there and knocked on the door.
00:51:55.695,00:52:06.081,"A person answered, and they verified, yes, a person by the name of Luka Magnotta had been living there, but he had since moved on to Russia."
00:52:09.126,00:52:15.715,"So here again, this so-called jet-setting lifestyle person is once again somewhere in Russia."
00:52:20.220,00:52:23.473,"You start thinking, Okay. This is never gonna be solved."
00:52:23.682,00:52:25.100,Nothing is gonna happen.
00:52:25.892,00:52:27.310,This was all pointless.
00:52:38.488,00:52:40.907,"and then, you know, a few months had started going by, and..."
00:52:42.117,00:52:47.831,We sort of lost that ferocity that we had because we didn't really have anything new to look at.
00:52:48.748,00:52:52.252,He didn't release any more videos. He didn't release any more images.
00:52:53.044,00:52:55.672,"And so, interest in the group kind of dwindled."
00:52:56.798,00:52:58.758,People kind of started disappearing.
00:52:59.634,00:53:03.180,"The group numbers went from, like, 15,000 maybe down to 8,000."
00:53:19.237,00:53:20.572,one video pops up.
00:53:46.765,00:53:52.395,"And it was, to this day, probably one of the worst videos I've ever seen."
00:54:03.531,00:54:05.992,This desperation in this cat's...
00:54:07.911,00:54:10.121,face that-- It's hard to describe.
00:54:10.205,00:54:11.498,It's... it's haunting.
00:54:12.207,00:54:18.672,And then you see the cat being lowered into the water and the person holding the cat underwater until it drowns.
00:54:21.424,00:54:25.553,"So then, later that day, another video appears, and we're like, What the fuck?"
00:54:28.223,00:54:31.184,"My first reaction was, Okay. This is number two."
00:54:31.643,00:54:37.732,"Kind of like the feeling, this is not the same, but kind of like the feeling when 9/11 happened, and the second plane hit the building."
00:54:37.816,00:54:39.985,"I was like, Okay, what's next? We're under attack."
00:55:02.215,00:55:04.884,It really was like a fuck you to us.
00:55:08.972,00:55:14.978,Then you realize that there's a huge python snake under the pillows of the bed.
00:55:18.315,00:55:20.734,"And, you know, the python is doing what the python is gonna do."
00:55:20.817,00:55:23.236,The python is gonna eat the cat.
00:55:39.252,00:55:40.128,When this happened...
00:55:43.214,00:55:44.883,...the group came alive again.
00:55:45.717,00:55:48.178,And we all kind of woke up from our slumber...
00:55:49.971,00:55:51.598,and paid him attention again.
00:56:00.440,00:56:06.112,"But when I saw the username that uploaded the video, I knew immediately what it was."
00:56:09.157,00:56:11.242,Lesley Ann Downey was a victim of...
00:56:12.952,00:56:14.913,Ian Brady and Myra Hindley.
00:56:17.332,00:56:21.002,"And they killed five children in Manchester, England."
00:56:21.753,00:56:23.338,It was called the Moors murders.
00:56:23.421,00:56:27.550,"I learned a lot about it 'cause I was a huge Smiths fan, and they wrote a song about it."
00:56:51.533,00:56:54.202,that Luka's got a fascination with serial killers.
00:57:05.255,00:57:07.382,"So, it was kind of... Well, it was not kind of."
00:57:07.465,00:57:08.550,It was very alarming.
00:57:15.807,00:57:18.101,also brought with them some press attention.
00:57:19.769,00:57:26.317,"The Sun newspaper in London, England, runs a story called Catch the Sicko Who Fed a Kitten to a Python."
00:57:34.868,00:57:37.495,gets a message from another sock puppet account.
00:57:42.792,00:57:54.679,"The person you're looking for is currently in London, England, and his name is Luka Magnotta, and he's staying at the The Fusilier Inn."
00:57:56.931,00:58:03.062,Alex West decides he's gonna go to the The Fusilier Inn to try and meet this person.
00:58:04.606,00:58:07.025,But Alex is secretly recording.
00:59:25.186,00:59:44.497,"We'll have to leave it at that, I think. I mean-- Alex West receives an e-mail."
00:59:53.172,00:59:58.094,It's so fun watching people work so hard gathering all the evidence and then not being able to name me or catch me.
00:59:58.678,01:00:00.138,"You see, I always win."
01:00:00.221,01:00:03.308,"I always hold the trump card, and I will continue to make more movies."
01:00:05.059,01:00:10.565,"Next time you hear from me, it will be in a movie I'm producing that will have some humans, not just pussies."
01:00:12.817,01:00:14.193,That's the alarming part.
01:00:15.153,01:00:18.489,Moving from pussies to people.
01:00:23.411,01:00:25.496,We didn't have lawful jurisdiction.
01:00:26.914,01:00:40.637,"So I started really panicking because here I am, who nobody listens to, but I know this was another stepping-stone to fame, this ladder that he was building."
01:00:44.724,01:00:48.186,"I remember somebody in our group saying, He's gonna kill somebody."
01:00:55.860,01:01:03.618,"...another sock puppet account posted a message to the group, but the message said, BAUDI MOOVIN 99."
01:01:14.796,01:01:22.679,And one of our group members ran across a video that this sock puppet account had clicked like on.
01:01:24.097,01:01:26.808,And I had a little bit of a warning before I clicked on it.
01:01:26.891,01:01:28.351,"You know, Hey, Deanna, brace yourself."
01:01:28.434,01:01:34.691,"This is a little frightening, Deanna, I don't want you to, you know, to worry too much, but... go ahead and click this video."
01:02:07.724,01:02:09.934,He's no longer just behind a computer.
01:02:12.812,01:02:13.813,This was real.
01:02:16.941,01:02:22.447,"So, you know, this starts off as a puzzle that I think I'm gonna solve in maybe two days."
01:02:22.530,01:02:25.158,"Get rid of some scum, and now here we are."
01:02:25.783,01:02:27.368,A potential killer...
01:02:27.827,01:02:29.162,"uh, might be after me."
01:02:35.001,01:02:36.961,I was legitimately concerned...
01:02:37.545,01:02:40.923,"that Luka would come into the office with, like, a knife."
01:02:46.429,01:02:49.724,Or that he would somehow break into my car and be in my back seat.
01:02:51.476,01:02:55.730,It was just paranoia beyond rationale.
01:03:00.443,01:03:03.946,"The things that were running through my mind was, Fuck, I gotta tell my boss."
01:03:05.114,01:03:07.617,Is he in danger now? Have I put him at risk?
01:03:08.075,01:03:09.952,"You know, I was really scared."
01:03:11.245,01:03:12.246,"I, uh..."
01:03:12.955,01:03:17.001,"Having to go to my boss and tell them what I had been doing online, and..."
01:03:17.460,01:03:21.589,"um, you know, even though it's a good thing that I've been doing it, it's still..."
01:03:22.381,01:03:25.510,"mortifying. I mean, can you imagine..."
01:03:25.718,01:03:33.726,"having this really high-tech job, with these very professional people, and having to go to them and tell them that you go home and fucking look online for a cat killer."
01:03:34.310,01:03:36.771,"Like, it's absolutely mortifying."
01:03:54.121,01:03:57.500,"And the phone vibrates, telling me I've got a Facebook message."
01:03:57.834,01:04:07.593,"I pick up my phone, and I look at it, and it says, Hey, um, there's this video I just came across, and I think you might want to look at it."
01:04:07.677,01:04:10.179,I think it's that guy Luka you've been looking for.
01:04:10.638,01:04:15.768,"So it's got my attention, and I'm thinking, Oh, great. Another cat killing video."
01:04:18.437,01:04:23.609,"I click on the link, I press play and the video starts."
01:04:24.610,01:04:27.363,"And I'm like, What the fuck?"
01:04:28.739,01:04:31.158,We fucking told them he was gonna kill somebody.
01:04:33.452,01:04:34.829,And nobody believed us.
00:03:13.985,00:03:15.612,Public enemy number one.
00:03:25.038,00:03:27.832,...possibly disguised as a woman.
00:00:21.646,00:00:23.440,"I'm in bed, sleeping..."
00:00:25.608,00:00:28.987,...and my phone vibrates telling me I've got a Facebook message.
00:00:30.405,00:00:39.039,"So, I pick up my phone, and I look at it, and it says, Hey, there's this new video on the Internet, and I think you might want to look at it."
00:00:39.164,00:00:42.042,I think it's that guy Luka you've been looking for.
00:00:42.208,00:00:47.297,"So, it's got my attention, and I'm thinking, Oh, great, another cat killing video."
00:00:52.969,00:00:54.471,It opens a browser.
00:00:55.430,00:00:57.974,"I see a video, and I press Play."
00:01:00.894,00:01:04.481,"In the previous videos, the object on the bed were cats."
00:01:04.564,00:01:07.233,"In this video, it was an actual person."
00:01:11.154,00:01:13.740,"And I'm, like, What the fuck?"
00:01:15.658,00:01:19.662,"At this point, I am fully awake, my heart is pounding."
00:01:19.746,00:01:26.044,"I immediately jump out of bed, run to my computer, and turn it on."
00:01:26.586,00:01:28.588,"Come on, computer. Let's go, let's go, let's go."
00:01:36.262,00:01:40.558,"Now I'm watching it on my large monitor, and I've got it full-screen."
00:01:42.852,00:01:44.312,Holy shit!
00:01:54.447,00:01:57.075,...and John Green had sent a Facebook link.
00:02:06.626,00:02:07.502,And I'm like...
00:02:12.215,00:02:14.008,What the fuck is happening?
00:02:14.175,00:02:16.761,I didn't... I didn't know what to... I...
00:02:17.804,00:02:19.305,I don't even know what to say.
00:02:19.597,00:02:22.058,"Well, we told them this would happen."
00:02:22.517,00:02:23.977,And they didn't believe us.
00:02:24.060,00:02:25.854,And now we're looking at a dead person.
00:02:31.985,00:02:33.903,It's the first time I've seen something like this.
00:02:39.826,00:02:40.869,and found a severed foot.
00:02:50.044,00:02:51.629,"a very, very well laid-out plan."
00:02:59.512,00:03:02.182,And he actually put things on the Internet.
00:03:06.227,00:03:08.521,There was moments that aren't even speakable.
00:03:09.689,00:03:12.817,"This man does not have a lot of friends. Not many who have surfaced, anyway."
00:03:17.655,00:03:19.365,How dangerous is this man?
00:03:19.449,00:03:21.826,How careful should people be right across the globe?
00:03:28.833,00:03:32.670,Interpol issued a worldwide arrest warrant for first-degree murder.
00:03:35.715,00:03:39.677,that online evidence of a twisted mind was ignored by police.
00:03:43.097,00:03:46.059,of him allegedly torturing and killing cats.
00:04:19.801,00:04:20.843,"And then, um..."
00:04:23.054,00:04:25.682,the per... The suspect sort of...
00:04:26.182,00:04:31.980,"checks on him and, you know, pets his face a little bit, loving on him a little bit."
00:04:32.814,00:04:36.693,And the camera is picked up now by the suspect.
00:04:37.443,00:04:39.821,We see the victim's face.
00:04:40.530,00:04:43.866,And then it cuts to a different angle.
00:04:44.409,00:04:45.827,"So, the suspect comes up."
00:04:46.077,00:04:48.037,"He's got something in his hand, uh..."
00:04:48.621,00:04:52.000,"some sort of stabby tool, ice pick kind of looking thing."
00:04:52.500,00:04:58.464,"And the suspect just starts stabbing and stabbing and stabbing, and the stabbing does not stop."
00:04:58.548,00:05:00.925,It goes on and on and on and on.
00:05:01.843,00:05:02.719,Um...
00:05:05.096,00:05:08.933,"eight minutes, ten seconds or so in, there's a dog, a little puppy introduced."
00:05:09.017,00:05:10.935,It's a little black-and-white dog.
00:05:15.690,00:05:20.320,"you start to wonder, like, what the kind of person that could do this to another person."
00:05:23.656,00:05:24.615,"And, um..."
00:05:29.537,00:05:31.164,It's hard to watch that.
00:05:36.461,00:05:37.503,And...
00:05:48.222,00:05:50.975,The rest of the video is-- It's hard to describe.
00:05:51.642,00:05:52.727,It's haunting.
00:05:59.150,00:06:06.616,"over and over again, probably 20 times that day, but every time I keep watching it, for some reason, my mind..."
00:06:07.492,00:06:09.202,doesn't want to believe it's true.
00:06:13.915,00:06:16.584,"So, we start doing what we normally do."
00:06:17.543,00:06:23.841,"We start analyzing this murder video, and we're trying to look for information that we could say that, Yes, this is Luka."
00:06:35.436,00:06:38.731,"So, first thing, it's very Luka-esque in style."
00:06:39.440,00:06:42.693,"The suspect pets him, kind of loves on him a little bit."
00:06:43.319,00:06:45.154,Very much like the kitten videos.
00:06:45.238,00:06:48.366,Because that's what Luka did. Luka loved on his victims.
00:07:15.852,00:07:17.895,but why the dog?
00:07:18.729,00:07:19.856,What's going on with the dog?
00:07:25.528,00:07:28.614,we started thinking the dog was a message to us.
00:07:28.698,00:07:31.742,"I got away with it, and I'm doing this now."
00:07:31.826,00:07:35.329,"And this is-- I'm graduating on to, you know, a human."
00:07:35.997,00:07:39.292,"Um, this dog is here as just an homage to my past."
00:07:39.709,00:07:41.294,"And a message to us, you know?"
00:07:41.836,00:07:42.712,Fuck you.
00:07:45.465,00:07:47.091,I know this is Luka.
00:07:47.175,00:07:50.219,I don't even have to see the person. I know it's Luka.
00:07:50.303,00:07:55.349,"The problem that we ran into was that we couldn't prove, like, the address of where it happened."
00:07:56.476,00:08:05.943,"We know he was in Toronto when he made the kitten killing videos, but we didn't know if he was there now, and we didn't know if the video was filmed there."
00:08:06.027,00:08:08.112,"So, we don't have jurisdiction."
00:08:08.446,00:08:13.618,"So as far as the police are concerned, as the law is concerned, this is Internet, you know, hoo-ha."
00:08:17.163,00:08:22.001,"So, the only contact that we had was with our detective at the Toronto Police Department."
00:08:23.127,00:08:25.087,So we contacted him.
00:08:26.547,00:08:28.841,We've just come across this new video.
00:08:28.925,00:08:30.635,It shows a dead body.
00:08:30.718,00:08:34.347,We are pretty sure it's Luka in the video who's committed the crime.
00:08:34.430,00:08:35.640,I need you to look at this.
00:08:37.099,00:08:39.519,"And I'm thinking, Great, he's gonna do something."
00:08:46.776,00:08:51.113,"Sooner or later, there's gonna be some breaking news that a body has been found."
00:09:01.624,00:09:04.919,So we were just kind of on edge waiting for something.
00:09:05.294,00:09:10.299,We were waiting for a ping of some kind on the radar.
00:09:13.636,00:09:15.888,A day goes by. No response.
00:09:20.643,00:09:27.066,"We were just kind of sitting back, going, Well, there hasn't been news yet. You know, Is there news yet?"
00:09:27.608,00:09:29.360,Why hadn't they found a body yet?
00:09:31.237,00:09:40.705,"We didn't know what he was gonna do next, so we felt we had a ticking time bomb on our hands, and we wanted it to stop."
00:09:47.920,00:09:50.423,I'm scared to death. Is he going to come after me now?
00:09:50.506,00:09:51.340,He knows who I am.
00:09:51.757,00:09:52.967,He knows where I work.
00:09:53.634,00:09:54.760,It was terrifying.
00:10:01.684,00:10:04.854,maybe the murder video wasn't made in Toronto.
00:10:05.104,00:10:07.315,It could've been made anywhere in the world.
00:10:08.482,00:10:09.734,And then I remembered...
00:10:10.943,00:10:15.364,"the video that was made three months prior, before the murder happened."
00:10:20.953,00:10:22.330,He's very narcissistic.
00:10:22.413,00:10:23.581,He's very vain.
00:10:23.664,00:10:28.544,"And we need to scan all these videos, even though it's just the worst thing in the world."
00:10:29.128,00:10:31.964,But you gotta sit through them because there could be a new picture.
00:10:34.800,00:10:38.095,"and she was like, Hey, I found this new YouTube video of Luka."
00:10:38.179,00:10:39.055,I want you to watch it.
00:10:41.724,00:10:45.686,"And about halfway through the video, I notice a photo that I've never seen."
00:10:47.521,00:10:52.568,"And I said, Are you talking about the photo of him in front of the rock steps? She goes, Yes."
00:10:55.154,00:10:56.280,about this picture.
00:10:57.073,00:10:58.574,"Number one, the trees."
00:10:58.949,00:11:04.789,"The foliage on the trees was still kind of sprouting, so it was like the beginning of spring."
00:11:05.706,00:11:08.292,"So I knew, this was recent, this was relevant."
00:11:08.709,00:11:11.879,The second thing that was important were the pedestrian lights.
00:11:12.755,00:11:14.173,They were very unique.
00:11:14.256,00:11:15.758,They didn't look like Toronto.
00:11:15.841,00:11:17.051,They were black.
00:11:17.134,00:11:19.053,I know the ones in Toronto are yellow.
00:11:19.303,00:11:20.638,"Uh, they were square."
00:11:37.822,00:11:40.116,"So, my hairs immediately went up on my neck."
00:11:40.574,00:11:42.535,"Oh, my God. Okay, maybe he went to Montreal."
00:11:46.247,00:11:51.836,And we just opened up Google Maps and started walking down the streets digitally.
00:11:54.922,00:12:00.428,And we're literally going through the Street View and going step by step by step down the street.
00:12:02.596,00:12:05.975,"And so I'm going down one street, she's going down another street."
00:12:06.058,00:12:08.853,"I'm going down this street, she's going down another street."
00:12:08.936,00:12:11.731,"I'm going down this street, she's going down another street."
00:12:14.692,00:12:18.779,"Then all of a sudden, I go, Holy shit."
00:12:24.160,00:12:26.954,"There's the stairs, right there."
00:12:33.252,00:12:36.338,And it was in the McGill University in downtown Montreal.
00:12:36.672,00:12:39.717,"So, we had placed him in Montreal."
00:12:43.763,00:12:47.683,"So now we gotta start looking at Montreal, and it's a place that we had never dealt with before."
00:12:53.022,00:12:54.899,It's a totally different province.
00:12:55.816,00:12:58.694,"Different jurisdiction, different police, different everything."
00:12:59.028,00:13:06.410,"This was gonna take even more time to, you know, establish credibility with the Montreal police now because we're just Internet nerds."
00:13:48.494,00:13:50.287,at 5720 Decarie.
00:13:51.747,00:13:54.500,It was Tuesday morning. I came downstairs.
00:13:55.626,00:13:59.880,"By the time I start taking out the garbage, I don't know, it was about maybe nine, 9:30."
00:14:01.340,00:14:06.178,"And when I was pulling it out, that's when I noticed a suitcase that was sitting on the side."
00:14:06.637,00:14:09.557,But I found it suspicious because there was a lock on it.
00:14:09.723,00:14:12.434,Why is there a lock on an old suitcase?
00:14:12.935,00:14:14.937,Who would throw this in the garbage?
00:14:15.312,00:14:19.817,And that's when I saw the maggots were coming out of the top of the hole.
00:14:22.027,00:14:23.112,So I figured somebody...
00:14:23.195,00:14:27.741,"their dog died or their cat died or something, and they didn't know what to do with it."
00:14:28.200,00:14:31.620,"But I got curious, so I decided to open it."
00:14:50.973,00:14:52.516,when 911 was called.
00:14:57.605,00:15:07.531,"That first day, when the first call came in at the office, actually, we thought it would be a short investigation, but it didn't turn out quite that way."
00:15:10.868,00:15:16.999,Somebody found a gray suitcase at 5720 Decarie Street.
00:15:19.460,00:15:21.503,"Upon arrival, there was already..."
00:15:22.129,00:15:23.047,red tape.
00:15:26.133,00:15:30.429,The suitcase in question was placed in the back alley of the building.
00:15:41.190,00:15:45.152,"The smell, first of all, it was devastating."
00:15:46.445,00:15:51.492,"There was many, many, many flies, and there were worms."
00:15:54.119,00:15:58.374,"So, we quickly put up the tent, so we could open it up."
00:16:00.751,00:16:07.174,"So the forensic, um, officer proceeded to open the suitcase."
00:16:07.508,00:16:13.555,"Immediately, what we saw is, first of all, it was a male, a white male."
00:16:14.056,00:16:14.890,Um...
00:16:15.432,00:16:26.819,"the arms were cut off, uh, the legs were cut off, and the head was cut off, and he was punctured many times in the abdomen region."
00:16:27.653,00:16:28.529,And...
00:16:29.697,00:16:33.909,"at that point, I'm asking myself, What kind of a person could do this?"
00:16:38.747,00:16:43.252,But somebody must have tipped off the media because they arrived very quickly.
00:17:03.522,00:17:05.649,And the first thing I see is a police tent.
00:17:07.860,00:17:09.028,Open up the link...
00:17:10.446,00:17:11.488,and it said...
00:17:12.740,00:17:15.284,Torso found in luggage in Montreal.
00:17:15.576,00:17:16.994,Holy shit!
00:17:21.415,00:17:24.334,and there was a torso with no head.
00:17:24.418,00:17:26.545,"And I was like, Fuck, they found it."
00:17:30.424,00:17:38.390,"We're, as a group, watching this all unfold before us, like, Holy shit, this is really real."
00:17:38.474,00:17:40.851,It was no longer a game of online.
00:17:40.934,00:17:42.311,This was real-world.
00:17:42.394,00:17:45.689,"The identity is not confirmed yet, but we know something for a fact."
00:17:45.773,00:17:48.192,"This is a male, uh, a white male."
00:17:54.031,00:17:55.282,before they even found the body.
00:17:56.825,00:17:59.828,"And, sure as shit, this has fucking happened."
00:17:59.912,00:18:03.332,"Everything that we said was gonna happen, it's done. He did it."
00:18:06.043,00:18:09.004,"So obviously, we contacted the Montreal Police Department."
00:18:11.006,00:18:16.470,"We had all this information to give them, but they were not responding to us at all."
00:18:17.346,00:18:28.649,"At one point, on Twitter, I got very vocal with them and angry and I kinda went off. You know, like..."
00:18:31.944,00:18:36.657,"There's people out here that could be in danger, and you're fucking ignoring me."
00:18:37.825,00:18:39.910,I've got all this shit to give you.
00:18:45.415,00:18:48.335,"And I let them have it, and nobody even responded to me at all."
00:18:49.419,00:18:55.050,Maybe they were just so busy with their investigation they didn't have time to deal with these Internet nerds.
00:18:55.634,00:18:57.427,We don't have any credibility.
00:19:14.444,00:19:16.738,"In total, there were 33 bags."
00:19:18.031,00:19:24.163,But I noticed a red-brownish substance that was dripping down under the trash bags.
00:19:24.705,00:19:26.290,I had the feeling it was blood.
00:19:27.749,00:19:30.586,We started going through the bags one by one.
00:19:32.212,00:19:33.797,We found one wine bottle.
00:19:35.841,00:19:38.510,There was a poster that was all crumpled up.
00:19:40.721,00:19:42.764,"Also, a yellow T-shirt."
00:19:44.224,00:19:47.352,We found a dead puppy in the bag.
00:19:48.562,00:19:50.189,Black-and-white dead puppy.
00:19:50.814,00:19:54.484,"Finally, in one of the garbage bags, we found something."
00:19:56.153,00:19:58.447,Blankets stained with blood.
00:19:59.740,00:20:01.992,"Okay, we hit the spot here."
00:20:03.243,00:20:04.828,We found papers.
00:20:05.787,00:20:07.956,A driver's license from Ontario.
00:20:12.753,00:20:19.092,A receipt from a pharmacy and both of them had a name on it: Luka Rocco Magnotta.
00:20:19.176,00:20:21.553,I don't have a clue who this person is.
00:20:21.637,00:20:23.680,I never heard that name before.
00:20:24.223,00:20:26.475,And I do have an address on the receipt...
00:20:27.267,00:20:31.688,"5720 Decarie Street, apartment 208."
00:20:32.731,00:20:45.410,"So now I'm concluding that what is in the trash, what is in the suitcase, comes from apartment 208, and it's probably Luka Rocco Magnotta that has been killed."
00:20:49.331,00:20:51.750,"So, I sent off a police officer..."
00:20:53.252,00:20:57.589,"to check, not to search the apartment, but just to make a check."
00:21:30.289,00:21:33.542,But there was nothing. It was clean.
00:21:36.378,00:21:37.879,There was basic furniture.
00:21:38.547,00:21:40.007,"On the table, there was..."
00:21:40.590,00:21:42.175,a bottle of lemon juice.
00:21:44.136,00:21:46.555,A bed with a brown sheet.
00:21:49.349,00:21:52.144,But the police officer was suspicious...
00:21:52.728,00:21:57.441,"because he said, It smells like chemicals."
00:21:58.150,00:22:02.154,"But there was nobody inside the apartment, so the apartment was shut back down..."
00:22:03.572,00:22:07.034,because we must have a warrant to search the apartment.
00:22:20.255,00:22:27.471,My supervisors informed me that there was a torso that was found in a suitcase and my presence was requested at the Decarie building.
00:22:29.348,00:22:33.393,I spoke to the administrator of the building to confirm that there were security cameras.
00:22:34.186,00:22:36.521,And he confirmed that there were two cameras in the building.
00:22:36.605,00:22:42.235,"There was a, uh, security camera at the front of the building, so you can see people coming in and out."
00:22:54.748,00:22:58.668,"And a camera in the basement, where people bring their garbage."
00:23:01.254,00:23:09.346,"Considering that the janitor had said that the suitcase was in the alleyway before he took the garbage out, we knew that that was a good starting point."
00:23:09.429,00:23:15.727,"So, we started to look at the images within that time frame to see if we could see the person who put the luggage there."
00:23:33.537,00:23:42.379,"We were able to see an individual on the 25th of May at approximately 2:47 in the morning, putting things in the garbage and leaving."
00:23:42.462,00:23:47.384,"A young man in his late 20s, wearing a yellow T-shirt."
00:23:48.301,00:23:55.225,"What was really odd about this individual was that, first of all, it's early in the morning, after 2:00 a.m., when most people are sleeping."
00:23:55.851,00:24:01.481,"Usually, I would imagine that if you're going to the garbage, you'd grab a garbage bag and do one trip."
00:24:01.565,00:24:03.733,But this individual was doing it repeatedly.
00:24:04.943,00:24:08.905,"This time, it's 4:02 in the morning, so he must have made at least 20 trips."
00:24:17.164,00:24:26.131,"We found a screwdriver painted with metal-color gray paint, modified to look like... maybe like an ice pick."
00:24:27.215,00:24:28.508,We found a knife...
00:24:30.260,00:24:33.346,but there was pieces of skin and blood on it.
00:24:34.681,00:24:35.974,We found a saw...
00:24:37.267,00:24:40.812,"and then finally, body parts."
00:24:43.273,00:24:46.276,We found the legs and the arms.
00:24:48.570,00:24:51.031,But there was something that was very curious.
00:24:51.323,00:24:54.701,"There were no hands, no feet, no head."
00:24:55.952,00:24:57.329,Those parts were missing.
00:25:11.551,00:25:23.355,"Good evening, we begin tonight with developing and sinister news from the nation's capital, where police are investigating two mysterious packages addressed to the headquarters of the Conservative Party."
00:25:25.899,00:25:30.820,A receptionist opened the blood-soaked box and found a severed foot.
00:25:38.245,00:25:44.626,"My head was spinning at that point. I was like, Wow, what are we going through at this point now?"
00:25:45.835,00:25:48.797,The left foot was wrapped in a pink silk paper.
00:25:49.381,00:25:52.425,"And opening the silk paper, there was a note."
00:25:52.759,00:25:55.053,"Actually, it was a poem."
00:25:56.805,00:25:57.889,Roses are red.
00:25:58.181,00:25:59.224,Violets are blue.
00:26:00.141,00:26:01.184,Police will need...
00:26:01.851,00:26:05.188,dental file to identify you. Bitch.
00:26:07.399,00:26:11.027,"Right now, we have major crime investigators investigating this."
00:26:11.653,00:26:14.990,"Okay? At this point, that's all I can tell you."
00:26:16.116,00:26:22.622,This is basically the prime minister of Canada that you're sending fucking human feet to.
00:26:23.915,00:26:25.917,This is a big deal.
00:26:28.211,00:26:29.921,This is the ultimate...
00:26:30.505,00:26:34.593,"just, Fuck you, I want attention. This is gonna be big news."
00:26:39.306,00:26:43.226,are likely to have been posted to other offices across the country.
00:26:43.560,00:26:46.563,He is going to get the attention of the world now on him.
00:26:47.314,00:26:48.189,Um...
00:26:49.441,00:26:50.275,You just...
00:26:51.276,00:26:52.110,You're...
00:26:53.028,00:26:56.615,"Putting myself back in that state, and how I'm talking right now is how I was."
00:26:56.698,00:26:58.241,I was all over the place.
00:26:58.992,00:27:01.077,And I think anybody would be.
00:27:01.161,00:27:04.998,I don't think anybody on this planet would be mentally prepared for something like that.
00:27:08.001,00:27:12.964,"You work so hard to prevent something from happening, and then it happens."
00:27:15.675,00:27:19.095,"And then you wonder, Did I push too hard?"
00:27:23.558,00:27:27.062,"You know, Did... did I not do enough? Did I not do enough?"
00:27:27.145,00:27:28.730,"Oh, honey, you did enough."
00:27:28.897,00:27:30.273,"Like, did you do too much?"
00:27:31.066,00:27:39.032,"Did you egg him on and give him the attention he wanted, and it was like a drug? It just stopped being enough for him."
00:27:39.366,00:27:40.784,Did he need more attention?
00:27:43.286,00:27:46.706,"You go through the spectrum of blame, blaming yourself."
00:27:48.416,00:27:53.213,"And it makes you sick, and your stomach hurts, and you're throwing up, and you're not eating."
00:27:54.381,00:27:58.051,I just want to curl up in my bed with my dogs and watch bad reality TV.
00:28:00.345,00:28:01.846,"So, I needed to go off-grid."
00:28:23.827,00:28:35.797,"After hearing the news that a left foot had been received at the Conservative office in Ottawa, I was immediately dispatched to a post office here in Montreal, which was about ten minutes away from the Decarie building."
00:28:35.880,00:28:45.640,"On this package, there was a bar code, so we were able to identify the post office which had sent off this package."
00:28:48.393,00:28:49.686,"So, this is it."
00:28:50.353,00:28:55.400,"This is the pharmacy, and the post office is located within this pharmacy."
00:29:03.825,00:29:07.704,"So, I told the pharmacy manager that I needed to see some security footage..."
00:29:10.039,00:29:13.543,from the approximate time in which this package would've been sent.
00:29:23.928,00:29:25.847,"And he's scrolling back and forth, back and forth."
00:29:27.766,00:29:29.309,"And then I tell him, Stop right there."
00:29:32.020,00:29:42.071,"We see an individual, standing in line, and in his hands, he has the package."
00:29:42.363,00:29:52.499,"I just looked at my partner that was with me, and he looked at me, and we knew, like, this is the same person that we saw in the basement of the Decarie building."
00:29:52.749,00:29:54.459,"A hundred percent, the same person."
00:29:56.628,00:29:59.214,"At that point, we knew that this was our suspect."
00:29:59.547,00:30:01.257,So now we had to identify him.
00:30:01.633,00:30:07.847,I asked the manager if he had any documentation which corroborated and validated the sending-off of this package.
00:30:08.306,00:30:12.769,The documentation that supported his transaction was signed by an individual called Rocco.
00:30:15.438,00:30:17.482,He also informed me that there was two packages.
00:30:17.565,00:30:20.819,"Not one package, but two packages, to my surprise."
00:30:25.156,00:30:27.367,I've never seen anything like it before.
00:30:27.450,00:30:30.119,I thought things like this just happened in movies.
00:30:32.372,00:30:34.707,a twisted story that keeps twisting.
00:30:34.916,00:30:42.298,"After a human foot was delivered to Conservative Party headquarters, today we learned the second body part, a hand, was sent to the Liberals."
00:30:42.382,00:30:50.390,I'm troubled that someone decided that a political party was a worthy target for that particular body part.
00:30:50.473,00:30:53.059,"I mean, who knows where the other body parts were sent?"
00:30:57.772,00:31:07.490,"and this name is Luka Rocco Magnotta, and this is not the victim, I'm, like, astonished. I'm like, Wow!"
00:31:10.952,00:31:16.583,"But unfortunately, we still don't have enough evidence to inform the public."
00:31:18.418,00:31:22.881,We still have to find out how Mr. Magnotta met with the victim.
00:31:23.506,00:31:28.428,How did Mr. Magnotta convince him to go to his place?
00:31:28.511,00:31:30.889,Having all those details...
00:31:31.848,00:31:34.767,would double our evidence.
00:31:48.823,00:31:52.160,"Bang, bang, bang on the front door and the side door."
00:31:52.243,00:31:55.788,"It sounded like someone was breaking in, so I grabbed the phone..."
00:31:56.748,00:31:58.666,and was just gonna call 911.
00:31:58.917,00:32:09.969,"And I seen, like, flashlights coming in the windows, so I crawled across the floor, up to the window, and just pulled it down a tiny bit to see because it was locked."
00:32:10.136,00:32:20.063,"And I saw a police officer at the door. And I start to shake because it was the middle of the night, and when a policeman comes to your house in the middle of the night, you know it's not good."
00:32:20.980,00:32:28.655,"I opened the front door, which now gave me a view of the street, and the whole street was lined with police vehicles."
00:32:29.530,00:32:32.450,And there was two officers at the front door.
00:32:34.035,00:32:35.411,"I said, Come in."
00:32:36.204,00:32:37.372,And one of them...
00:32:38.247,00:32:43.920,"looked over, and he said, He's a lot smaller than I thought he was."
00:32:47.131,00:32:50.134,"He said, Are you Luka Magnotta's mother? I said, Yes."
00:32:51.552,00:32:54.597,"And I'm like, Oh, my son! What's wrong with my son?"
00:32:54.973,00:32:57.809,"He said, There's nothing wrong with your son. We're looking for him."
00:32:58.184,00:33:02.397,"And I'm like, Oh, about the cat videos?"
00:33:05.900,00:33:07.694,"He said, Is your son here?"
00:33:07.777,00:33:11.155,"I said, No. I'm like, Why are you looking for him?"
00:33:11.823,00:33:13.199,They wouldn't answer me.
00:33:13.282,00:33:15.743,And they just... They left.
00:33:26.379,00:33:37.390,"He had been on vacation and was unaware, and when he got back, they had told him about what had transpired and how Montreal Police were looking for a Luka Magnotta."
00:33:40.309,00:33:45.857,"And this is a person you've spent, you know, the last two years of your life searching every week."
00:33:45.940,00:33:49.986,Now you're hearing the detective name him in a murder.
00:33:51.487,00:33:52.780,It was very surreal.
00:34:08.755,00:34:12.925,but I was asked to come to the mobile commander post.
00:34:13.926,00:34:21.142,"I enter, and I've got four pair of eyes that are looking at me and says, Claudette, you better sit down."
00:34:32.070,00:34:35.031,that was becoming viral on the web.
00:34:39.494,00:34:40.620,We put the video on.
00:34:43.956,00:34:47.752,And now I'm witnessing a human being being murdered.
00:34:54.258,00:34:59.680,"As a homicide investigator, you always investigate once the murder has happened."
00:35:00.264,00:35:04.644,"But now, I was witnessing what happened."
00:35:05.353,00:35:10.441,"It's like I... if I was behind the murderer, watching him do a murder."
00:35:20.118,00:35:21.786,"I said, This is impossible."
00:35:22.411,00:35:24.372,What I'm seeing is impossible.
00:35:24.747,00:35:30.294,They didn't have the same sense that I did because I was the one that was in the trashes.
00:35:36.134,00:35:37.135,the poster.
00:35:39.929,00:35:43.141,"That poster, I saw it in the trash."
00:35:44.767,00:35:47.061,But I didn't think it was relevant.
00:35:48.146,00:35:52.942,"It was completely unreal, but I knew one thing."
00:35:53.651,00:35:56.821,"What happened, happened in apartment 208."
00:35:58.823,00:36:08.291,Then I see a person in what seems to be a bathtub with the water running and playing around with the head.
00:36:09.250,00:36:11.252,The head... He's just spinning the head around.
00:36:14.755,00:36:17.133,This is the first time I see...
00:36:17.717,00:36:18.843,the victim's face.
00:36:19.844,00:36:23.973,It's the first time I can place a face on the torso that I have.
00:36:24.056,00:36:28.519,"I can see an Asian man, young man, in his mid-30s."
00:36:32.565,00:36:39.864,"After that, I see a black-and-white puppy, with the individual holding a knife."
00:36:40.323,00:36:43.868,"At that point, I had to stop. I had to walk out."
00:36:43.951,00:36:45.703,This was ridiculous.
00:36:46.913,00:36:47.997,I come back in...
00:36:51.334,00:36:55.630,then I see-- I have to stop.
00:37:17.652,00:37:20.571,we started to look at more security footage...
00:37:22.740,00:37:24.325,of the Decarie building.
00:37:25.117,00:37:29.080,I was looking at a few days before the torso had been found.
00:37:34.502,00:37:36.712,"And at one point, I was able to see..."
00:37:38.464,00:37:41.926,"two people, two young men in their late 20s, entering the building."
00:37:45.388,00:37:49.558,One was the suspect that we had seen in the post office.
00:37:50.851,00:37:53.938,"And the other one didn't seem to be, like, a white person."
00:37:56.023,00:38:00.611,"He seemed maybe to be, like, a little darker, maybe Asian, maybe South American."
00:38:03.948,00:38:06.867,I started to look through the missing persons reports.
00:38:07.201,00:38:10.204,"And I fall upon a name, Jun Lin."
00:38:24.510,00:38:25.803,It was Sunday evening.
00:38:27.680,00:38:36.731,"I was having dinner and received a phone call from Jun Lin's ex-boyfriend, asking me if I had seen Jun Lin..."
00:38:38.232,00:38:40.151,in the past few days. I said no.
00:38:41.444,00:38:45.031,He hadn't heard from Jun Lin for about 60 hours.
00:38:45.448,00:38:57.543,That was extremely unusual because he was the kind of person who would call us if he was going somewhere else.
00:39:00.921,00:39:02.631,Jun Lin was quite a shy person.
00:39:03.424,00:39:13.100,"He wasn't openly gay, but that's why he came to Canada because it's a more liberal and accepting place."
00:39:15.978,00:39:17.146,"This is the, uh..."
00:39:19.065,00:39:21.484,building where Jun Lin used to live.
00:39:33.913,00:39:43.047,"When I got here, uh, that door was locked, so I had to call the superintendent to get the permission to enter the building and his apartment."
00:39:45.466,00:39:46.550,I went to the kitchen.
00:39:46.634,00:39:52.890,"There's a frying pan with frying oil, and the eggs was waiting to be fried."
00:39:53.933,00:39:56.936,"The cat... The cat, uh..."
00:39:58.187,00:40:03.859,was crawling out of his bedroom with his stomach on the floor.
00:40:04.777,00:40:08.072,It looked like the cat hadn't eaten for a few days.
00:40:09.490,00:40:11.784,Jun Lin's cat was like his baby.
00:40:12.118,00:40:15.246,He wouldn't have left his cat unattended for a couple of days.
00:40:17.915,00:40:20.251,So I called to the police immediately.
00:40:20.418,00:40:23.796,"They say, Well, stay where you are. We need to talk to you."
00:40:25.089,00:40:27.716,Then I...
00:40:29.135,00:40:32.471,started to feel things...
00:40:34.515,00:40:35.599,were going wrong.
00:40:45.443,00:40:54.452,and what I wanted to do was to go where Jun Lin lived to get some objects for eventual DNA comparison.
00:40:56.620,00:40:59.290,We took a toothbrush and a water bottle.
00:41:06.464,00:41:08.382,But there was a rumor.
00:41:10.217,00:41:14.513,"A killing, a gruesome killing video being circulated online."
00:41:19.059,00:41:21.520,I heard the victim was an Asian guy.
00:41:25.232,00:41:27.610,"I found out a video called, uh..."
00:41:28.819,00:41:32.740,"1 Lunatic, 1 Ice Pick."
00:41:43.501,00:41:49.965,"I didn't watch the complete clip, but I did glance through it."
00:41:53.052,00:41:57.139,"So, at the very end, I saw a picture."
00:42:04.063,00:42:07.024,This person with a head cut off.
00:42:09.735,00:42:11.946,"And, uh, that was the moment..."
00:42:12.488,00:42:14.657,I identified that's Jun Lin.
00:42:35.177,00:42:40.266,and I was still sort of in my pity party watching bad TV.
00:42:41.058,00:42:41.976,Nonsense.
00:42:43.561,00:42:44.436,"The victim, we know..."
00:42:45.854,00:42:48.857,"...to be a 33-year-old victim, which is Jun Lin."
00:42:48.941,00:42:50.609,He's a student from Concordia University...
00:42:57.283,00:42:58.867,Such a horrible video.
00:42:58.951,00:43:00.119,It's not the movies.
00:43:00.202,00:43:02.621,Now we gotta focus about finding the suspect.
00:43:02.705,00:43:04.915,That's the reason why we need help with the public. We...
00:43:06.542,00:43:14.216,"Okay, these cops are still looking for Luka, so I really need to get my ass together and get back online and join my team."
00:43:21.140,00:43:22.600,I was gonna get him.
00:43:25.728,00:43:28.897,I wanted to figure out the last Luka movements...
00:43:30.357,00:43:31.650,right before the murder.
00:43:33.152,00:43:34.778,Then I started thinking about...
00:43:35.904,00:43:36.780,the puppy.
00:43:37.865,00:43:41.368,The puppy was something that he would have had to have acquired somewhere.
00:43:44.580,00:43:47.791,A lot of people on the planet use Craigslist to get free dogs.
00:43:48.083,00:43:55.549,"We just cast this wide net and start reading every post that mentioned, you know, free puppies or I want a puppy."
00:43:59.553,00:44:02.306,And we found a posting...
00:44:02.931,00:44:05.392,that was made four days before the murder.
00:44:05.726,00:44:08.020,"Hi, I have a limited-space apartment."
00:44:08.103,00:44:10.022,I'm looking for any dog.
00:44:10.105,00:44:11.940,I'm very experienced with dogs.
00:44:12.024,00:44:13.776,My family owned a pet shop.
00:44:14.401,00:44:18.197,"A normal person reading this wouldn't think anything of it, but when I read it, I remembered..."
00:44:18.989,00:44:34.171,"that one of the sock puppets we were tracking, Vladamir Romanov, had made a posting on a website about a year ago, and it said, My family owned a pet store."
00:44:34.421,00:44:38.801,"So, I have all this-- This is all happening in my mind super fast when I'm reading this."
00:44:38.884,00:44:42.429,"So four days prior to the murder, this post was made."
00:44:42.513,00:44:44.181,It matches Luka's writing.
00:44:45.265,00:44:51.689,"Once we figured out the puppy, we wanted to start looking at how did Luka come into contact with the victim?"
00:44:51.772,00:44:55.567,So we stayed on Craigslist because it obviously worked for him.
00:45:02.991,00:45:04.535,"There's tons of them, okay?"
00:45:05.744,00:45:14.420,"One of the things that Luka always does is he'll type something, and then he'll do a space and then a comma and then a space."
00:45:16.380,00:45:19.466,Another thing that he does is he spells probably wrong every single time.
00:45:20.509,00:45:22.678,"He'll say things like, so hot."
00:45:24.179,00:45:28.058,"Or sexy guy, things like that. There were more, but things like that."
00:45:28.142,00:45:30.436,So it's easy to recognize Luka when it's Luka.
00:45:33.605,00:45:36.233,Next. Next. Next.
00:45:37.192,00:45:38.360,"And then, all of a sudden..."
00:45:41.739,00:45:45.033,"space, comma, space."
00:45:46.410,00:45:52.040,"This posting was done on May 24th, and the murder happened on the 25th."
00:45:52.124,00:45:55.919,"And it said, I'm looking for a sexy guy."
00:45:56.545,00:45:59.381,"Okay, sexy guy, that's a Luka phrase."
00:46:02.468,00:46:03.552,Send me your picture.
00:46:03.635,00:46:05.429,Send me your face. Send me your body.
00:46:07.222,00:46:10.309,"Finally, I'm gonna be making a movie."
00:46:12.686,00:46:13.854,It was Luka.
00:46:28.577,00:46:34.333,Jun Lin and Luka Rocco Magnotta arrive at the apartment on Decarie together.
00:46:38.754,00:46:42.966,"And they both walk in, and they both seem, like, very happy at that moment."
00:46:48.305,00:46:51.892,"But, later on, only one person leaves the building."
00:46:53.393,00:46:57.564,And he's wearing the same yellow T-shirt that Jun Lin was wearing before.
00:47:01.568,00:47:03.612,had Oxazepam in his blood.
00:47:03.695,00:47:05.322,Oxazepam is a sedative.
00:47:06.365,00:47:11.078,Residue that was found in the wine bottle contained the same sedative.
00:47:11.620,00:47:20.128,So I do hope that Mr. Lin was knocked out before Mr. Magnotta cut his throat.
00:47:26.927,00:47:28.929,"He stops, and he looks at himself in the mirror."
00:47:31.223,00:47:33.642,He looks as if he doesn't have a worry in the world.
00:47:38.397,00:47:39.773,He's got a bag in his hand.
00:47:40.023,00:47:45.195,We're presuming that he was buying plastic gloves and other articles to clean up the crime scene.
00:47:54.663,00:47:59.918,"we put on the forensic white suit, commonly called bunny suits."
00:48:08.552,00:48:09.386,I enter.
00:48:09.928,00:48:11.763,But I smell two things.
00:48:11.847,00:48:16.476,"I smell, like, a cleaning product, and I smell blood."
00:48:19.479,00:48:30.324,"It's hard to describe what blood smells like, but if you take a pound of ground meat and you leave it on the counter for six, seven hours..."
00:48:31.742,00:48:35.037,"And definitely, in the apartment, it smelled like blood."
00:48:42.753,00:48:46.882,"We covered the windows, so the apartment was pitch-black."
00:48:48.508,00:48:51.595,And then the biologist proceeded to do the luminol.
00:48:56.141,00:49:02.397,They use a certain liquid that reacts very strongly to blood.
00:49:04.733,00:49:11.323,"But, especially where the bed, the mattress, and the wall, that place there, it looked like..."
00:49:11.990,00:49:14.159,you walk in a discotheque.
00:49:15.035,00:49:18.872,"Pitch black, and everything is lighting up."
00:49:19.831,00:49:24.670,"So you could see that, clearly, the murder happened on the bed."
00:49:29.549,00:49:34.179,"And then, after that, the body was brought to the bathroom."
00:49:41.019,00:49:46.775,And you could see clearly that the torso was put against the door.
00:49:50.612,00:49:53.156,"I'm saying to myself, Wow."
00:49:54.074,00:49:59.871,"Once again, I could be right behind the murderer, and I'm witnessing."
00:49:59.955,00:50:02.874,I'm feeling. I feel the murder.
00:50:02.958,00:50:05.544,I feel what happened in the apartment.
00:50:05.627,00:50:10.132,"I hear the music. I have the smell, the smell of the blood."
00:50:22.769,00:50:28.400,"Luka likes to leave breadcrumbs, and one of the breadcrumbs he left in the video was the song."
00:50:32.612,00:50:37.534,"And, one of the best movies ever made was American Psycho."
00:50:38.493,00:50:42.039,"In that movie, the opening sequence is New Order, True Faith."
00:50:48.503,00:50:51.048,He always has the perfect clothes on.
00:50:52.257,00:50:55.302,He's very into himself and how he presents himself.
00:50:55.969,00:51:00.265,This was important because Luka is very obsessed with how he looks.
00:51:00.348,00:51:02.726,He likes to present himself a certain way.
00:51:03.351,00:51:07.522,We believe he really started to identify with this Christian Bale character.
00:51:09.107,00:51:10.984,"He wanted to be successful, to have money."
00:51:11.943,00:51:13.945,You're a fucking ugly bitch.
00:51:15.947,00:51:18.200,But he's also this crazy serial killer.
00:51:18.575,00:51:21.995,I'm gonna stab you to death and play around with your blood.
00:51:23.205,00:51:26.666,Serial killers aren't one-murder people.
00:51:26.750,00:51:28.543,They kill a series of people.
00:51:29.377,00:51:30.796,He wants to do this again.
00:51:37.928,00:51:49.856,"You walk in, and, to my surprise, there's something written on the wall: If you don't like the reflection, don't look in the mirror. I don't care."
00:51:52.943,00:51:56.696,Why is that written there? I don't know.
00:51:57.989,00:52:00.575,"At this point, I feel like I'm in a thriller movie."
00:52:02.035,00:52:08.667,But there's one phrase in that message that made me scared: I don't care.
00:52:08.750,00:52:15.882,"If this individual doesn't care, does that mean he can repeat?"
00:52:18.927,00:52:21.721,Are we starting to have a serial killer?
00:52:22.180,00:52:25.267,Is he going to kill again because he doesn't care?
00:52:36.444,00:52:40.365,"And we're sitting there at the time and wondering, Where the fuck is he?"
00:52:51.251,00:53:00.010,"On May 29th at 10:15, a citizen reported a strong smell coming from the alley behind 5720 Decarie Boulevard in Montreal."
00:53:00.093,00:53:04.764,They then discovered a torso inside a traveling luggage.
00:53:05.348,00:53:10.145,"Six o'clock p.m. on the same day, the Conservative Party received a package..."
00:53:15.150,00:53:18.612,"This news feed was coming up about, um..."
00:53:18.904,00:53:20.322,a murder in Montreal.
00:53:21.031,00:53:23.450,"And, you know, it was just constant."
00:53:23.533,00:53:26.536,"Every time I'd go check, I'd see this, murder, murder, murder."
00:53:27.204,00:53:32.209,"We then learned of the existence of a video that was posted on the web, showing a possible homicide."
00:53:32.459,00:53:33.627,Nine o'clock p.m....
00:53:35.253,00:53:36.421,Then they released...
00:53:37.005,00:53:42.344,"suspect is a 29-year-old male, and they..."
00:53:44.387,00:53:46.681,they flashed a picture and the name.
00:53:52.229,00:53:54.439,You get a picture of the suspect. You get his name also.
00:53:55.023,00:53:57.692,This is the 29-year-old suspect we're looking for...
00:53:58.276,00:53:59.319,Luka Magnotta.
00:54:00.820,00:54:01.696,Wanted...
00:54:03.365,00:54:04.783,for murder.
00:54:06.952,00:54:08.620,My heart sank.
00:54:08.954,00:54:11.289,It was like I lost my footing on the world.
00:54:13.458,00:54:19.714,"We're looking for the suspect, and if anyone got information for us, they will have to dial 911. This is a priority for us."
00:54:25.387,00:54:33.395,"I have to tell you, it was an odd feeling getting, you know, the head of the Montreal Police to say, Luka Rocco Magnotta."
00:54:33.478,00:54:35.188,It was something we'd been waiting for for a while.
00:54:35.272,00:54:48.910,"A little bit of it, it validated all the work that we had been doing, and at the same point, it pissed us off because I remember thinking, Well, if they just would have listened to us three months prior, maybe Jun Lin wouldn't be dead today."
00:54:52.789,00:55:00.463,"And they asked to join our little secret Facebook group of information about Luka, where we kind of dumped all of our evidence."
00:55:06.136,00:55:11.850,"The entire group of us were kind of... not chuckling, but kind of just shaking our heads."
00:55:11.933,00:55:13.893,"Like, They have no idea what they're in for."
00:55:14.686,00:55:17.564,They were gonna make the mistake that we did by underestimating him.
00:55:18.857,00:55:22.319,We knew that Luka was kind of an expert in evasion.
00:55:22.402,00:55:25.989,"You know, he did escape Toronto and went to Montreal after the kitten videos."
00:55:26.072,00:55:31.703,"So, he just killed a person, he's clearly going to leave and go somewhere, but we didn't know where he was gonna go."
00:55:36.541,00:55:42.172,"So, in the murder video, you see a movie poster for the movie Casablanca."
00:55:44.424,00:55:48.303,"One of our group members goes, Hey have you guys ever seen the opening scene?"
00:55:48.386,00:55:50.347,"We're like, No. And they're like, Go watch it."
00:55:57.854,00:56:01.775,"And I'm thinking, like, Oh, this is another clue. Luka is telling."
00:56:01.858,00:56:04.444,He's projecting what he's planning to do next.
00:56:06.279,00:56:08.114,And then I watched the end of the movie.
00:56:08.198,00:56:10.408,"Inside of us, we both know you belong with Victor."
00:56:10.492,00:56:12.952,"You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going."
00:56:13.036,00:56:16.039,"If that plane leaves the ground, and you're not with him, you'll regret it."
00:56:16.122,00:56:19.667,"Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."
00:56:20.752,00:56:21.753,But what about us?
00:56:22.754,00:56:24.130,We'll always have Paris.
00:02:19.514,00:02:24.561,...getting other news that there was a person who had witnessed this online. They tried...
00:05:39.088,00:05:47.138,We received a report from Interpol Canada about a suspect who had committed a horrific murder and then had flown to Paris.
00:05:48.890,00:05:55.980,"We mobilised the entire taskforce of 30 to 40 officers to go to Roissy, Charles de Gaulle Airport."
00:06:05.823,00:06:12.622,"We were told he was wearing a wig, a Mickey Mouse T-shirt."
00:06:14.665,00:06:19.670,"So, we check the CCTV footage."
00:06:34.977,00:06:35.978,Bingo!
00:06:39.774,00:06:43.111,He heads out to the taxi pickup area.
00:06:47.448,00:06:51.452,"He doesn't speak to anyone, and he acts pretty normal."
00:06:55.206,00:06:59.752,"He goes up to a taxi, puts his luggage in, and gets into the car."
00:07:06.134,00:07:15.935,"So, we search for and identify the taxi company who quickly give us the name of the driver of this taxi."
00:07:16.394,00:07:21.357,"And he says, Yes, I dropped off this person at a hotel called Novotel."
00:07:24.986,00:07:29.949,We don't waste any time and rush to the hotel.
00:08:06.777,00:08:14.952,"As soon as I arrive with my team, we make our way straight to reception, and we asked them if they had a reservation in the name of Luka Magnotta."
00:08:15.286,00:08:20.541,"And immediately after checking, they discover Magnotta has a reservation."
00:08:21.250,00:08:24.212,He reserved in the name of Luka Rocco Magnotta for one night.
00:08:29.050,00:08:34.597,"But, unfortunately, he never slept at the hotel."
00:08:44.440,00:08:46.984,"At this point, we don't know where he is."
00:08:47.610,00:08:49.737,"He could be anywhere. In Paris, around Paris."
00:08:49.820,00:08:51.739,He could have left the city already.
00:08:54.534,00:08:58.162,"So, we are back to square one."
00:11:14.131,00:11:28.062,"The Canadian police gave us a crucial piece of information, that one of Luka Rocco Magnotta's credit cards was used for a withdrawal at an ATM located in Place de Clichy."
00:11:31.065,00:11:34.527,So we check through the CCTV footage.
00:11:43.494,00:11:47.832,And that's important for us as it confirms he's still in Paris.
00:11:54.839,00:11:59.802,You could definitely assume that Luka Magnotta would like this area.
00:12:02.179,00:12:03.806,It attracts a lot of prostitutes.
00:12:06.058,00:12:10.146,"So potentially, yes, the people he might meet..."
00:12:11.230,00:12:12.898,could end up being his victims.
00:12:18.988,00:12:25.369,"At that time, I ordered my team to go to every hotel in the area, one by one."
00:12:31.292,00:12:32.960,After four or five hours of checking hotels...
00:12:38.674,00:12:40.760,the search comes to nothing.
00:12:41.594,00:12:42.887,everybody goes home.
00:12:56.108,00:13:02.406,"The following morning, I turn on the TV, and I come across the 24-hour news channels..."
00:13:02.782,00:13:09.246,"Luka Rocco Magnotta, a 29-year-old Canadian, currently the target of an international arrest warrant."
00:13:09.330,00:13:12.833,He is at the center of a sordid murder that took place in Montreal last week.
00:13:12.917,00:13:14.543,"He is, nevertheless, now in France."
00:13:15.002,00:13:18.130,"For me personally, I don't think that's a good thing."
00:13:19.006,00:13:24.553,We're used to working in the shadows at the Fugitive Task Force because our cases aren't usually covered by the media.
00:13:26.806,00:13:30.017,"But in fact, it's the only thing the 24-hour news channels are talking about."
00:13:35.272,00:13:37.691,A troubled personality with many faces.
00:13:37.775,00:13:40.319,He almost looks like any tourist.
00:13:40.402,00:13:43.572,He has mentioned he has a taste for blood.
00:13:44.073,00:13:52.790,"This publicity leads to many people coming forward, and so we receive an enormous number of sightings."
00:13:53.207,00:13:58.254,"In every area of Paris, this man is trying to avoid the police."
00:14:02.132,00:14:04.593,"For us, this could be a blessing."
00:14:05.094,00:14:08.764,He has been spotted in several bars in the capital.
00:14:10.307,00:14:16.438,But it's also a curse because we've got to authenticate every single one.
00:14:18.440,00:14:26.615,"As of now, the leads are not very productive, but police will continue the search to find the man they are already calling the Butcher of Montreal."
00:25:36.034,00:25:40.038,"...the Canadian, already nicknamed the Butcher of Montreal."
00:25:40.580,00:25:43.375,Several leads are being investigated by the police.
00:25:46.962,00:25:50.590,"Among the tips that were received, there was one that leaped out."
00:25:51.258,00:25:53.426,This witness was called Jean-Christophe.
00:25:54.719,00:26:00.976,And he explains that someone came to his home by the name of Luke.
00:26:02.978,00:26:08.108,And he told him that he had been staying at the Novotel Hotel.
00:26:09.359,00:26:15.991,"This clue had never been disclosed to the media, so we immediately call him in for questioning."
00:26:19.911,00:26:27.294,Can you tell us the circumstances of how he got into contact with you?
00:26:27.377,00:26:31.881,The first written contact we had was through the Internet site PlanetRomeo.
00:26:31.965,00:26:34.134,It's a website to meet people.
00:26:34.801,00:26:38.096,"I received a text message, if I remember correctly."
00:26:38.179,00:26:42.684,"It said, It's Luke. I'm in Paris. Can we meet?"
00:26:47.731,00:26:52.319,"He walked in, was courteous, polite."
00:26:53.403,00:26:55.405,He seemed a little nervous.
00:26:56.865,00:26:58.116,And then what happened?
00:26:59.242,00:27:00.201,Nothing.
00:27:01.077,00:27:02.037,What do you mean?
00:27:03.246,00:27:04.664,I went to sleep.
00:27:05.290,00:27:06.291,And him?
00:27:06.416,00:27:08.001,He slept on the sofa.
00:27:10.837,00:27:12.714,-Any sexual relations? -No.
00:27:14.007,00:27:16.176,-Any physical contact between you two? -No.
00:27:19.262,00:27:34.361,"It's surprising that he spends the night at Jean-Christophe's two days after committing his violent act, and yet he doesn't say that Magnotta is in a complete frenzy or that he is acting strangely."
00:27:36.112,00:27:38.448,He stayed until the next morning.
00:27:39.074,00:27:46.039,"But when I found that he was a wanted man, I thought, Can this really be him?"
00:27:48.500,00:27:51.127,I had two pieces of information that he had given me.
00:27:51.211,00:27:56.800,"The hotel where he stayed, and the second one was the phone number he used."
00:27:57.509,00:28:00.428,I imagine that he got that phone in France.
00:28:00.887,00:28:03.598,Why do you think that he got it in France?
00:28:03.682,00:28:06.434,Because +06 is a French number.
00:28:08.770,00:28:14.526,The most important thing that he gave us was the phone number that Magnotta had used to contact him.
00:28:14.943,00:28:16.695,This was more than we'd hoped for.
00:28:19.614,00:28:23.785,We were able to find out where the phone had been bought.
00:28:24.077,00:28:27.288,In a store near Porte de Bagnolet.
00:28:37.257,00:28:40.760,"So, we checked every hotel around the Porte de Bagnolet station."
00:28:47.517,00:28:48.935,This is the Soumman Hotel.
00:28:53.690,00:28:59.571,It's a hotel better suited to someone who wants to hide out.
00:29:02.282,00:29:07.203,"And the manager of the hotel, when we show him the photo, he says, Yes, that rings a bell."
00:29:07.787,00:29:12.876,"He booked the room for eight or nine nights, which he paid for in cash."
00:29:15.420,00:29:17.380,It's possible he's even here now.
00:29:20.925,00:29:26.598,"My team progresses, keeping in mind that Magnotta could be behind the door."
00:29:31.644,00:29:33.396,They enter the room.
00:29:40.528,00:29:44.365,"In the bedroom, we find the T-shirt he was wearing when he first arrived."
00:29:49.454,00:29:51.581,"Unfortunately, Magnotta isn't there."
00:29:54.793,00:29:58.338,"And in the toilet, we found a student ID card."
00:30:00.632,00:30:03.301,He's clearly trying to erase the Magnotta identity.
00:30:04.719,00:30:05.845,He was gone.
00:30:08.014,00:30:11.476,We were not far behind him. We were really not very far behind him.
00:30:14.270,00:30:23.112,"But then we discover that, in fact, the booking was not made in the name of Luka Rocco Magnotta, but in the name of Kirk Tramell."
00:30:24.531,00:30:37.001,"At this point, I feel like he's moved on to the next phase, and he has, in fact, decided to truly go on the run by using a new identity."
00:30:37.752,00:30:38.878,He could be anywhere.
00:31:58.082,00:31:59.459,It was a Monday.
00:32:02.629,00:32:03.796,The weather was nice.
00:32:06.591,00:32:07.717,Nice and fresh.
00:32:16.100,00:32:19.646,"I came to work at the Internet café here in Neukölln, Berlin."
00:32:33.076,00:32:36.454,"I read the newspapers, as usual."
00:32:38.039,00:32:42.168,I love reading the news. It's an obsession of mine.
00:32:43.461,00:32:53.221,"Then I read a report about a man that chopped up his lover, cut his head off, and then mailed the body parts to the Canadian government."
00:32:54.430,00:32:58.184,I couldn't believe a person could be so brutal.
00:32:58.518,00:33:00.645,What kind of character can do that?
00:33:08.778,00:33:10.613,"And then suddenly, he's standing in front of me."
00:33:18.663,00:33:27.005,"I was shocked, but he was very polite, with a French accent, and he looked totally normal."
00:33:27.088,00:33:29.048,Like the guy next door.
00:33:30.133,00:33:32.260,"So he said, Sir, Internet?"
00:33:32.885,00:33:35.221,"And I said, Okay, come with me."
00:33:37.724,00:33:39.475,The Internet booths are up here.
00:33:39.767,00:33:44.439,"Thirty-six Internet booths. Please follow me, and I will show you."
00:33:48.359,00:33:52.905,"And here at number 25, is where he was sat."
00:33:53.489,00:33:58.953,He sat with his back turned to me so that I could watch him and see what he was doing.
00:34:38.284,00:34:40.369,I still wasn't sure if it was actually him.
00:34:41.037,00:34:43.247,He doesn't look like a murderer.
00:34:44.415,00:34:47.585,So I went upstairs to number 25.
00:34:51.464,00:34:55.885,So I grabbed this trashcan as if I were cleaning up.
00:34:56.219,00:34:59.722,"I picked up an ashtray, but one eye was always on him."
00:35:03.142,00:35:06.020,I wanted to check exactly what he was doing on the Internet.
00:35:10.900,00:35:13.277,I saw that he had gone onto the Interpol site.
00:35:22.453,00:35:24.747,He was looking at his own mug shot.
00:35:29.335,00:35:31.963,It was clear to me he was the one.
00:00:13.346,00:00:21.062,"Now to Canada, where police today issued an arrest warrant for Luka Rocco Magnotta in a grisly murder case where a man’s torso was found..."
00:00:22.230,00:00:29.029,"Residents had discovered a human torso inside a, uh, suitcase left on the side of the curb for garbage pickup."
00:00:29.362,00:00:35.452,"And even more troubling, Magnotta may have filmed the killing and dismemberment of his victim."
00:00:40.290,00:00:41.583,This is world news.
00:00:41.666,00:00:44.919,"This is red-alert, top-wanted news."
00:00:49.632,00:00:54.888,He has littered the Internet with photos of himself and couldn’t seem to get enough of himself online.
00:00:56.473,00:01:01.853,"He was clearly someone who wanted this bizarre form of notoriety, and it seems now he’s got it."
00:01:01.936,00:01:04.105,This is exactly what Luka wants.
00:01:04.189,00:01:06.858,He wants to be known as some famous killer.
00:01:06.941,00:01:12.530,They are afraid that he might try to befriend someone and basically commit a similar crime to the one that they're looking for.
00:01:14.115,00:01:16.242,that he had planned to make multiple movies.
00:01:16.326,00:01:18.828,"He didn't say one movie, he used plural, movies."
00:01:25.335,00:01:29.339,"he did it twice, and he did it a third time."
00:01:30.715,00:01:32.634,"So, I was sincerely expecting two more videos."
00:01:33.301,00:01:35.011,He is a master of disguise.
00:01:35.095,00:01:37.680,"He likes to, you know, adopt different hairstyles."
00:01:37.764,00:01:40.975,One officer suggested he might even disguise himself as a woman.
00:01:47.107,00:01:52.570,"And I don't want to say like Jack the Ripper, because nobody ever knew who Jack the Ripper was."
00:01:52.862,00:01:55.532,Luka wanted to be known. He just didn't want to get caught.
00:02:00.787,00:02:04.833,that online evidence of a twisted mind was ignored by police.
00:02:06.918,00:02:12.132,Something could have been done before a man was killed and mutilated in Montreal.
00:02:17.637,00:02:18.805,they’re a disgrace.
00:02:26.521,00:02:28.565,and you're also acting like stalkers.
00:02:31.067,00:02:36.364,They'd zoom in on pictures to make sure that this is the location he's saying he was in at a certain time.
00:02:36.447,00:02:38.283,"Oh, we’ve tracked him here."
00:02:38.366,00:02:39.325,We've done this.
00:02:39.409,00:02:42.495,We've put this picture and matched it up with this headlight...
00:02:42.579,00:02:45.123,this streetlamp from this certain location.
00:02:47.292,00:02:48.334,They’re crazy.
00:02:51.462,00:02:56.593,"Acting like high school children, using the Internet to destroy somebody."
00:02:57.635,00:03:01.014,They're so inquisitive and yet so naive.
00:03:01.472,00:03:11.441,"Like, if you really want to be a wannabe investigator, find the whole story because, guys, you're after the wrong person here."
00:03:12.775,00:03:14.861,There's someone else responsible here.
00:03:40.970,00:03:43.181,we contacted the Montreal Airport.
00:03:45.516,00:03:50.855,"And we informed them that he's wearing a wig, a black wig, down to the ears."
00:03:51.147,00:03:55.944,"He's wearing a black T-shirt, short-sleeve T-shirt with a Mickey Mouse on it."
00:04:09.874,00:04:13.419,"Eventually, we see a person walking around in the airport."
00:04:15.713,00:04:17.715,We see him going through security.
00:04:18.633,00:04:22.345,"We see him placing his hair, always doing... and placing his hair."
00:04:35.149,00:04:38.361,"And eventually, Mickey Mouse."
00:04:46.828,00:04:48.329,Mr. Magnotta has...
00:04:49.455,00:04:50.331,a ticket...
00:04:52.041,00:04:54.836,for a flight of Air Transat number 610...
00:04:56.546,00:04:58.298,"...to Paris, France."
00:04:58.464,00:05:01.634,"Immediately, we contacted the French authorities."
00:05:03.261,00:05:10.393,"We explained the gravity of the crime, the seriousness, and the fear that he would strike again."
00:05:10.476,00:05:13.479,That he would repeat the same thing and kill somebody else.
00:05:48.931,00:05:56.189,"A brigade of between 30 and 40 officers was mobilized to go to Roissy, Charles de Gaulle Airport."
00:06:11.079,00:06:12.663,a Mickey Mouse T-shirt.
00:06:35.186,00:06:36.187,Bingo!
00:06:39.690,00:06:43.027,He heads out to the taxi pickup area.
00:06:55.123,00:06:59.669,"He goes up to a taxi driver, puts his luggage in, and gets into the car."
00:07:16.477,00:07:21.441,"And he says, Yes, I dropped off this person at a hotel called Novotel."
00:08:06.903,00:08:14.827,"Directly, when I arrive with my team, we make our way straight to reception, and we asked them if they had a reservation in the name of Luka Magnotta."
00:08:15.203,00:08:20.458,"And immediately after checking, they discover Magnotta has a reservation."
00:08:21.209,00:08:24.170,He reserved in the name of Luka Rocco Magnotta for one night.
00:08:54.575,00:08:58.204,"So, we are back to square one."
00:09:03.042,00:09:06.337,a 29-year-old Canadian whose job résumé includes acting.
00:09:06.420,00:09:09.090,Police think Magnotta could now be in France.
00:09:09.173,00:09:10.675,"Really quickly, why France?"
00:09:10.758,00:09:13.761,Why do Canadian authorities think that he may have run to France?
00:09:15.596,00:09:18.808,We're not gonna be able to go into hotels and look around and whatnot.
00:09:18.891,00:09:24.146,But we did want to offer the police assistance because we thought it was valuable.
00:09:26.983,00:09:28.818,less heat on him. Who knows?
00:09:31.821,00:09:36.409,"but on the other side of Luka, that we also know very well, is that..."
00:09:36.993,00:09:38.202,he likes the chase.
00:09:39.954,00:09:45.876,One of the people that he admired was the Leonardo DiCaprio character in Catch Me If You Can.
00:09:45.960,00:09:49.213,That guy evaded the FBI agent the whole movie.
00:09:49.547,00:09:51.882,And Luka looked up to that level of genius.
00:09:57.430,00:10:04.353,"One of the things Luka does, though, is he leaves us breadcrumbs 'cause he wants us to chase him."
00:10:06.314,00:10:07.732,One that we found...
00:10:09.734,00:10:11.235,"was, like, super significant."
00:10:17.116,00:10:22.455,"Luka had made a blog post, talking about Luka Magnotta: How to Disappear and Never Be Found."
00:10:27.001,00:10:30.588,how to successfully evade law enforcement.
00:10:31.631,00:10:34.550,Step one: Cut ties with everybody who knows you.
00:10:34.634,00:10:37.803,"Don't talk to your sister no more, cut off all your friends."
00:10:37.887,00:10:39.722,Don't talk to Mom. Step...
00:10:39.805,00:10:46.312,"...two, it talks about liquidating all your assets into cash so that you don't have any digital footprint, you have no bank account."
00:10:46.395,00:10:48.898,And step three: acquire false identification.
00:10:48.981,00:10:51.192,"Get a fake passport, a fake driver's license."
00:10:55.946,00:11:02.036,"But in Luka's mind, there's no sense in being on the run and being this Internet villain if nobody's chasing you."
00:11:43.411,00:11:47.748,And that's important for us as it confirms he's still in Paris.
00:11:54.755,00:11:59.719,You could definitely assume that Luka Magnotta would like this area.
00:12:02.096,00:12:03.723,It attracts a lot of prostitutes.
00:12:05.975,00:12:10.062,"So potentially, yes, the people he might meet..."
00:12:11.147,00:12:12.815,could end up being his victims.
00:12:18.904,00:12:25.286,"At that time, I ordered my team to go to every hotel in the area, one by one."
00:12:31.208,00:12:32.877,After four or five hours of checking hotels...
00:12:38.591,00:12:40.676,the search comes to nothing.
00:12:43.387,00:12:47.767,"Once we'd exhausted all lines of investigation for the day, everybody goes home."
00:12:56.066,00:13:02.364,"The following morning, I turn on the TV, and I come across the 24-hour news channels..."
00:13:02.740,00:13:09.205,"Luka Rocco Magnotta, a 29-year-old Canadian, currently the target of an international arrest warrant."
00:13:09.288,00:13:12.792,He is at the center of a sordid murder that took place in Montreal last week.
00:13:12.875,00:13:14.502,"He is, nevertheless, now in France."
00:13:14.960,00:13:18.088,"For me personally, I don't think that's a good thing."
00:13:18.964,00:13:24.512,We're used to working in the shadows at the Fugitive Task Force because our cases aren't usually covered by the media.
00:13:26.764,00:13:29.975,"But in fact, it's the only thing the 24-hour news channels are talking about."
00:13:35.189,00:13:37.608,A troubled personality with many faces.
00:13:37.691,00:13:40.236,He almost looks like any tourist.
00:13:40.319,00:13:43.489,He has mentioned he has a thirst for blood.
00:13:43.989,00:13:52.706,"This publicity leads to many people coming forward, and so we receive an enormous number of sightings."
00:14:18.440,00:14:26.824,"As of now, the leads are not very productive, but police will continue the search to find the man they are already calling the Butcher of Montreal."
00:14:34.748,00:14:37.084,meaning butcher or cutter.
00:14:37.167,00:14:40.880,And they say French police have tracked him all over Paris.
00:14:42.214,00:14:44.758,"that Magnotta's family lives in Peterborough, Ontario."
00:14:44.842,00:14:46.844,That is just northeast of Toronto.
00:14:46.927,00:14:50.848,And our Alex Mihailovich is now in Peterborough and joins me live.
00:14:50.931,00:14:53.559,"So, Alex, so what can you tell me about Magnotta's family there?"
00:14:53.642,00:14:54.977,Are they saying anything?
00:14:56.061,00:14:59.523,"Well, we're standing right in front of Magnotta's mother's house."
00:14:59.607,00:15:00.566,Her name's Anna Yourkin.
00:15:00.941,00:15:04.987,"From everything that we can discern out of this situation, we've talked to some neighbors..."
00:15:07.072,00:15:08.616,They were on the street.
00:15:08.866,00:15:09.909,"They were, um..."
00:15:10.409,00:15:11.410,on my porch.
00:15:12.202,00:15:13.495,The phone was ringing.
00:15:14.330,00:15:16.040,They were banging on the doors.
00:15:16.749,00:15:20.294,They were yelling and asking me for comments.
00:15:26.717,00:15:34.642,the reason that Luka committed the cat killings and then graduated to the murder was because he was after notoriety.
00:15:35.142,00:15:36.602,Do you think that could be true?
00:15:38.020,00:15:42.191,"No, that is the farthest thing from the truth that is out there."
00:15:43.359,00:15:45.361,This is not who you should be looking for.
00:15:45.444,00:15:48.405,It's... it's the puppet master you should be looking for.
00:15:53.285,00:15:58.082,I have a bag to share with some very special items that I've kept over the years.
00:15:58.582,00:16:10.010,"And one year, for my birthday, Luka had these custom-made for me that I absolutely love wearing when it's cold because it's like walking on pillows."
00:16:11.428,00:16:12.846,And I have here...
00:16:13.973,00:16:15.683,this old key chain.
00:16:15.766,00:16:18.310,A little Basic Instinct movie poster.
00:16:18.852,00:16:20.187,He liked Basic Instinct.
00:16:20.270,00:16:25.442,"Loved all kinds of films, so I keep this."
00:16:28.612,00:16:30.823,Luka always loved movies.
00:16:32.491,00:16:41.000,"As a little boy, he was shy by nature, and as he got older, he was bullied nonstop."
00:16:42.251,00:16:44.962,"It was, We don't like how you slick back your hair."
00:16:45.337,00:16:56.015,"They would call him, gay, fag, you're a little pussy, making his self-worth um, just diminish every day."
00:16:59.560,00:17:07.026,"It made him withdraw, so he would sit in the living room on his own, watching movies."
00:17:11.238,00:17:18.245,"He liked Humphrey Bogart, James Dean, Jean Harlow, Marlene Dietrich."
00:17:19.329,00:17:20.372,He loved them.
00:17:25.377,00:17:27.921,"So, when he was 16, he moved to Toronto..."
00:17:29.631,00:17:32.301,because he was trying to be an actor and a model as well.
00:17:39.475,00:17:41.143,-Okay. -Let's see what happens.
00:17:41.226,00:17:44.563,"All right. My name is Luka Magnotta, and I'm 25."
00:17:45.439,00:17:48.358,"I'm pretty comfortable in front of the camera, so..."
00:17:49.068,00:18:03.207,"I... would be very excited to do this, and it would be a great opportunity, Yay, Luka. I just want to get a couple of shots of your head."
00:18:09.296,00:18:12.591,And then I believe that's when he started escorting.
00:18:16.428,00:18:19.348,He started to explain escorting to me and what it was.
00:18:19.932,00:18:23.685,"He was bisexual, and he was making an awful lot of money."
00:18:26.146,00:18:27.606,He was a good-looking man.
00:18:44.206,00:18:50.879,"Luka started telling me the clientele he was seeing were becoming more of a darker, elusive crowd."
00:18:53.048,00:18:57.845,"They were into fetishes, abuse, and they liked to dominate."
00:18:58.137,00:19:03.183,"And I was, like, This sounds like it's getting a little dangerous here."
00:19:06.436,00:19:11.275,"Around this time, a client was becoming more than a client."
00:19:13.026,00:19:13.986,More like his...
00:19:16.238,00:19:17.072,his keeper.
00:19:20.450,00:19:22.619,A client by the name of Manny.
00:19:23.704,00:19:25.622,Emmanuel Manny Lopez.
00:19:29.543,00:19:32.129,"Luka told me, you know, Manny would follow him."
00:19:33.005,00:19:34.131,He was a stalker.
00:19:34.756,00:19:37.134,"And that he had moved, but he'd continuously find him."
00:19:37.217,00:19:38.427,He'd changed his phone number.
00:19:39.011,00:19:42.139,"He would continuously say, I have connections."
00:19:42.222,00:19:43.557,You'll do what I say.
00:19:44.516,00:19:49.396,"And I thought, you know, I don't like any of this. I..."
00:19:50.147,00:19:51.690,It scares the hell out of me.
00:19:53.984,00:19:55.068,A few weeks later...
00:19:56.153,00:20:01.158,...rumors start to circulate around family members that there was a video on the Internet...
00:20:02.951,00:20:08.457,"...of my son, Luka, murdering a... a cat."
00:20:15.422,00:20:16.256,The man...
00:20:17.925,00:20:19.176,resembled my son.
00:20:25.390,00:20:27.142,Something wasn't right.
00:20:31.730,00:20:32.731,I shut it off.
00:20:39.112,00:20:40.572,I asked him about the video.
00:20:41.156,00:20:44.326,"He said, I was forced to do it."
00:20:48.914,00:20:50.916,"He said, Manny."
00:20:53.335,00:21:03.136,"He explained that Manny was selling videos of animals being tortured or murdered on the deep web, and he was making an awful lot of money."
00:21:05.389,00:21:08.058,"He said, Please go back and look at the end of the video."
00:21:17.526,00:21:23.282,"And at the end of the video, I saw someone else."
00:21:26.618,00:21:27.703,The hands of Manny.
00:21:30.247,00:21:33.125,"I said, That's it, we have to go to the police."
00:21:33.875,00:21:36.128,We have to before it gets out of hand.
00:21:36.211,00:21:37.337,It's already out of hand.
00:21:37.796,00:21:42.301,"And he said, If you go to the police, I'm cut-- I'm severing all ties."
00:21:43.593,00:21:47.139,"You don't realize what they can do. To me, to you, to any of you."
00:22:02.446,00:22:11.079,"a year and a half before the murder, I get this phone call from a man insistent that he had to see me right away."
00:22:11.163,00:22:15.500,"He said it was a matter of life and death, and he had to see me in the next few minutes."
00:22:21.882,00:22:26.053,"When he first came into my office, he looked like a very pathetic, vulnerable figure."
00:22:26.136,00:22:30.932,"And one of the first things he said to me was, You kind of look like Michael Douglas."
00:22:33.727,00:22:37.647,"I've-- Over the years, I've gotten it here and there, yeah."
00:22:38.815,00:22:40.776,"And I said, Well, what's happening?"
00:22:41.360,00:22:43.904,"And he said, Look, I'm accused of killing a cat."
00:22:44.446,00:22:45.405,"I said, Okay."
00:22:45.489,00:22:48.325,"I said, I have seven cats. That's not a nice thing."
00:22:48.408,00:22:51.578,"And he said, uh, Well, uh..."
00:22:51.828,00:22:52.996,I didn't do it.
00:22:53.080,00:22:57.167,"He said that, oh, he was forced to do it by, um..."
00:22:57.751,00:23:00.837,"this person, and his name was Manny."
00:23:02.089,00:23:03.048,I told him...
00:23:03.256,00:23:06.468,Manny has to be reported. You have to go to the police.
00:23:06.551,00:23:09.846,He said that Manny is always there.
00:23:10.222,00:23:15.602,Manny is torturing him and forcing him to do these things.
00:23:18.980,00:23:24.986,"Well, later that day, I get an e-mail from Luka, the title of which is List of Abuse from Manny."
00:23:26.321,00:23:29.366,Strangled me with his hands and with an electrical cord.
00:23:30.283,00:23:32.119,Stabbed me with a pencil and pen.
00:23:33.036,00:23:34.871,Forced me to eat animal parts.
00:23:36.123,00:23:38.542,Bought worms and made me eat them.
00:23:39.459,00:23:44.214,Forced me to have sex with his puppy and numerous cats.
00:23:45.924,00:23:49.636,"I mean, uh... it just was mind-boggling, this list."
00:23:51.012,00:23:59.896,"A week later, I was home, and I received an e-mail late at night, obviously referring to Manny."
00:24:01.731,00:24:08.280,"Then I received a picture of Luka, apparently after suffering some injuries."
00:24:09.156,00:24:11.533,"Um, there's a black eye, bruise on the nose."
00:24:11.616,00:24:16.079,"It looks like a scarring or ligature mark on his neck, a bruise on his lip."
00:24:18.039,00:24:26.673,"About a week after, I receive a phone call from the Miami Beach Police Department regarding Luka Magnotta."
00:24:29.301,00:24:31.553,And they said Luka ended up in the hospital.
00:24:32.471,00:24:48.361,"Apparently, he was drugged, kidnapped from New York, brought down to Miami, raped by Manny and other people, and then left on the beach, and the police took him to the hospital for treatment."
00:24:49.070,00:25:00.749,"It made me think that, A, there was corroboration of the abuse that Luka was talking about with regard to Manny and, B, that Manny was indeed a very dangerous person."
00:25:06.546,00:25:25.815,"Then, a year later, when I heard that Luka was the suspect in this horrible, sadistic murder, I couldn't believe the Luka that I knew, vulnerable, timid, could have committed such a heinous act, and if so, could have committed it alone."
00:25:37.160,00:25:39.955,already nicknamed the Butcher of Montreal.
00:25:40.497,00:25:43.291,Several leads are being investigated by the police.
00:25:49.089,00:25:50.507,there was one that leaped out.
00:25:51.174,00:25:53.343,This witness was called Jean-Christophe.
00:25:54.636,00:26:00.892,And he explains that someone came to his home by the name of Luke.
00:26:02.936,00:26:08.066,And he told him that he had been staying at the Novotel Hotel.
00:26:09.317,00:26:15.949,"This clue had never been disclosed to the media, so we immediately call him in for questioning."
00:26:22.581,00:26:27.252,of how he got into contact with you?
00:26:29.713,00:26:31.840,was through the Internet site PlanetRomeo.
00:26:31.923,00:26:34.092,It's a website to meet people.
00:26:34.759,00:26:38.054,"I received a text message, if I remember correctly."
00:26:38.138,00:26:42.642,"It said, It's Luke. I'm in Paris. Can we meet?"
00:26:49.733,00:26:52.277,"was courteous, polite."
00:26:53.361,00:26:55.363,He seemed a little nervous.
00:27:21.890,00:27:34.152,"two days after committing his violent act, and yet he doesn't say that Magnotta is in a complete frenzy or that he is acting strangely."
00:27:38.823,00:27:45.789,"But when I found that he was a wanted man, I thought, Can this really be him?"
00:27:48.249,00:27:50.877,I had two pieces of information that he had given me.
00:27:50.960,00:27:56.549,"The hotel where he stayed, and the second one was the phone number he used."
00:28:10.939,00:28:14.359,was the phone number that Magnotta had used to contact him.
00:28:14.776,00:28:16.528,This was more than we'd hoped for.
00:28:19.823,00:28:23.993,We were able to find out where the phone had been bought.
00:30:37.919,00:30:39.045,He could be anywhere.
00:30:52.016,00:30:53.977,And I had something like...
00:30:54.060,00:30:55.687,six missed calls.
00:30:55.770,00:30:58.398,I had 37 unread messages.
00:30:58.481,00:31:00.984,A hundred and twenty-five Facebook notifications.
00:31:01.067,00:31:16.040,"And I'm like, Oh, my God, what has happened?' And I start reading my notifications, and it's all, you know, Baudi! Baudi! Baudi! Baudi!"
00:31:22.422,00:31:25.049,And John Green had posted a video.
00:31:27.677,00:31:35.602,"And it's, like, this random CCTV, and I'm thinking to myself, What the fuck is this?"
00:32:02.754,00:32:03.922,The weather was nice.
00:32:06.716,00:32:07.842,Nice and fresh.
00:32:16.225,00:32:19.771,"I came to work at the Internet café here in Neukölln, Berlin."
00:32:32.992,00:32:36.371,"I read the newspapers, as usual."
00:32:37.956,00:32:42.085,I love reading the news. It's an obsession of mine.
00:32:43.378,00:32:53.137,"Then I read a report about a man that chopped up his lover, cut his head off, and then mailed the body parts to the Canadian government."
00:32:54.347,00:32:58.101,I couldn't believe a person could be so brutal.
00:32:58.434,00:33:00.561,What kind of character can do that?
00:33:30.091,00:33:32.218,"So he said, Sir, Internet?"
00:33:32.844,00:33:35.179,"And I said, Okay, come with me."
00:33:37.640,00:33:39.392,The Internet booths are up here.
00:33:39.684,00:33:44.355,"Thirty-six Internet booths. Please follow me, and I will show you."
00:33:48.276,00:33:52.822,"And here at number 25, where he was sat."
00:33:53.406,00:33:58.870,He sat with his back turned to me so that I could watch him and see what he was doing.
00:34:10.131,00:34:13.634,I was training eight police cadets in my van.
00:34:15.553,00:34:30.818,"I was a teacher, and we were doing some practice work, um, helping all the other police cars, doing accidents or small things, what is not very dangerous, which we could do with the cadets."
00:35:51.649,00:35:53.276,from that Internet café.
00:36:25.600,00:36:31.772,"the most badass German fucking police department walks in, just one after another, boom."
00:36:31.856,00:36:33.149,There were like ten of them.
00:36:36.819,00:36:39.238,Ten of them in these awesome little berets and shit.
00:36:39.322,00:36:40.156,It was dope.
00:36:40.615,00:36:43.534,And he's got nowhere to go. He's got nowhere to escape.
00:36:46.871,00:36:49.207,"You see him come into frame, and he's got handcuffs."
00:36:51.042,00:36:53.461,"And it was just like, Holy shit!"
00:36:53.544,00:36:56.631,"And I just kind of, you know, put my hands up in the air."
00:36:58.716,00:37:00.009,They finally caught him.
00:37:01.010,00:37:04.263,And it was just like the perfect way for Luka to go down.
00:37:04.347,00:37:10.770,Luka was caught in an Internet café because he couldn't stay away from his vanity.
00:37:20.404,00:37:25.034,but no air company wanted to be associated to Mr. Magnotta.
00:37:27.828,00:37:32.667,So we asked the Canadian army force for one of their planes...
00:37:34.627,00:37:36.254,to go and get Mr. Magnotta.
00:37:38.256,00:37:42.802,It's highly unusual for a suspect to be brought back home by Canadian military transport.
00:37:42.885,00:37:51.519,But police say there was simply no way that this suspect could be put on a commercial flight where others might recognize his face and the horrifying acts of which he is accused.
00:38:02.363,00:38:05.825,We were literally tracking the flight across the Atlantic.
00:38:10.037,00:38:12.540,his hands and feet shackled during the flight.
00:38:33.936,00:38:37.648,"Oh, that's the moment we've been waiting two years for."
00:38:39.775,00:38:41.902,Touchdown. He's back in Canada.
00:38:43.988,00:38:47.033,"And I mean, I swear, I have goosebumps thinking about it."
00:38:47.116,00:38:48.784,It was just fucking awesome.
00:38:49.493,00:38:51.746,"Catch me if you can? Well, guess what, motherfucker."
00:38:51.829,00:38:52.997,You just got caught.
00:39:16.437,00:39:20.274,like he was enjoying all the exposure that he got.
00:39:23.569,00:39:24.570,Like...
00:39:24.945,00:39:26.822,I think I achieved what I wanted...
00:39:35.873,00:39:36.916,celebrity.
00:39:53.516,00:39:57.228,This was unbelievable. A real circus. A media circus.
00:40:02.650,00:40:04.985,It reminded me of O.J. Simpson.
00:40:08.697,00:40:15.037,"who's been the focus of an international manhunt since fleeing Canada last week, was arrested by police at an Internet café."
00:40:16.956,00:40:19.542,He's expected to go before a judge tomorrow.
00:40:22.253,00:40:23.963,this guy is no dumbshit.
00:40:26.132,00:40:27.591,This is a huge game for him.
00:40:27.883,00:40:35.057,"He intentionally misdirected us for almost two years, so, clearly, we were all thinking that this was not the end."
00:40:38.310,00:40:40.688,That was really scary 'cause we didn't know what was coming next.
00:40:45.317,00:40:48.737,Why do you need so many people to transport my son?
00:40:49.530,00:40:52.408,"He's... you know, he's a young boy."
00:40:56.829,00:41:03.252,"And then I see them lead my son out, and he looked so confused and scared."
00:41:07.923,00:41:10.301,What could possibly be going through his head?
00:41:14.680,00:41:15.764,Was he afraid...
00:41:17.850,00:41:18.767,of Manny?
00:41:45.419,00:41:46.837,How'd you sleep last night?
00:41:53.677,00:41:55.763,I'm looking at him. He's not looking at me.
00:41:55.846,00:41:58.682,He's looking mostly downwards towards the table.
00:41:59.767,00:42:01.185,Look at me. Look at me.
00:42:01.268,00:42:03.687,I feel you're not listening to me if you are not looking at me.
00:42:04.104,00:42:06.774,"He was very meek. He was very meek, very quiet."
00:42:07.691,00:42:09.443,"Is it because you are shy of me, or..."
00:42:17.451,00:42:19.745,We didn't want to know if it was him. We knew it was him.
00:42:19.828,00:42:21.372,What we wanted to know was why.
00:42:21.455,00:42:22.540,Why this happened.
00:42:23.207,00:42:24.458,All I want is the truth.
00:42:26.126,00:42:27.545,"Okay, Luka, listen."
00:42:28.337,00:42:30.548,I'm not gonna talk about the case.
00:42:30.631,00:42:34.718,"What happened in the past, we can't change anything, you understand?"
00:42:34.802,00:42:38.347,The reason why you're here today is because something went wrong.
00:42:38.681,00:42:40.849,I just want to remain silent about everything.
00:42:40.933,00:42:43.602,I don't want to say anything about anything.
00:42:46.730,00:42:48.607,I just want to remain silent.
00:42:53.821,00:42:57.575,"This, today, is maybe one of the most important days of your life."
00:42:58.534,00:43:01.829,Okay? A lot happened from the end of May till today.
00:43:02.955,00:43:06.667,"Okay, Luka? Listen, we don't need to know if you did."
00:43:08.752,00:43:13.591,Is it possible that I could get a sweater Do you have another sweater with you?
00:43:13.716,00:43:15.843,Or a blanket or something? I just feel cold.
00:43:34.862,00:43:36.113,He's so tiny.
00:43:36.739,00:43:39.992,"He's so small. He's so, uh... fragile."
00:43:43.746,00:43:45.581,And so polite.
00:43:46.498,00:43:49.251,I can't say I was scared of the person.
00:43:50.544,00:43:52.087,He looked vulnerable.
00:43:56.550,00:43:58.135,He doesn't look like a killer.
00:44:03.223,00:44:09.396,"It's only normal. I know that, you know, you cried on the plane, so there's something in you that's working."
00:44:09.480,00:44:11.023,You're not a machine.
00:44:11.106,00:44:12.816,"You know, you don't look like a bad person."
00:44:12.900,00:44:14.109,You're very polite.
00:44:15.944,00:44:17.988,You understand what I'm trying to say?
00:44:21.450,00:44:25.579,"Sometimes in life, things don't work out exactly the way we planned them out."
00:44:33.337,00:44:34.838,Can I have a cigarette?
00:44:40.719,00:44:41.679,Thank you.
00:44:57.945,00:45:01.657,We know all that. We have the evidence. That's not a problem.
00:45:03.242,00:45:07.705,"You know? Okay. What's important for me, just right now, at this moment, is the family."
00:45:15.003,00:45:17.464,This is a picture I was able to get.
00:45:19.633,00:45:20.634,Take a look.
00:45:22.928,00:45:24.847,"The family, they want an explanation."
00:45:28.767,00:45:29.768,What's wrong?
00:45:32.896,00:45:34.106,What's wrong?
00:45:34.565,00:45:35.566,I don't want it.
00:45:43.031,00:45:46.326,"What you wanted to accomplish, Luka, well, you succeeded."
00:45:47.828,00:45:48.662,It's done.
00:45:49.663,00:45:51.832,Everybody knows Luka Magnotta.
00:45:54.668,00:45:55.753,You understand?
00:45:57.546,00:45:59.673,There must be a reason why things went that way.
00:46:01.508,00:46:05.971,"Maybe, I don't know, maybe something happened, and it pushed you to do what happened."
00:46:06.930,00:46:08.640,Only you can explain that.
00:46:13.979,00:46:15.063,Luka?
00:46:15.939,00:46:17.733,"Is it because you're scared, or..."
00:46:18.734,00:46:22.112,"How do you feel right now inside? Are you, like, worried about something?"
00:46:22.196,00:46:24.782,What's your biggest fear at this moment?
00:46:34.082,00:46:35.292,It's understandable.
00:46:36.043,00:46:37.795,"So, just give me a few moments."
00:47:05.155,00:47:06.031,Hello?
00:47:08.325,00:47:10.452,"Can somebody help me, please?"
00:47:11.453,00:47:12.955,"Hello, I need help."
00:47:15.833,00:47:17.292,I need help.
00:47:20.671,00:47:21.964,I need help.
00:47:31.098,00:47:43.318,"at the request of the defense, to conduct a forensic assessment of Mr. Magnotta to try and help the court determine whether or not he could be found not criminally responsible for his crimes."
00:47:46.029,00:47:56.290,"Very early in our discussions, Mr. Magnotta shared with me that he hadn't done this alone and that there was another individual involved, an individual by the name of Manny."
00:47:57.249,00:48:08.218,And it was very clear that Mr. Magnotta was very fearful of this individual and that Manny had been the one to incite Mr. Magnotta to kill Mr. Lin.
00:48:08.719,00:48:10.137,"You know, is this plausible?"
00:48:10.304,00:48:13.015,Is he... is he having me on here?
00:48:13.098,00:48:17.853,"Is this Manny character, is he just making this up to try and excuse his behavior?"
00:48:23.775,00:48:34.995,"I looked into his records and saw that he had complained to many other people, many years ago, that this Manny character actually existed and was abusing him."
00:48:35.078,00:48:36.914,I called family members.
00:48:37.497,00:48:41.209,I called lawyers that he had contact with in the past.
00:48:41.835,00:48:50.260,"Many of these individuals told me that Mr. Magnotta had talked about this individual, Manny, many years before."
00:48:54.014,00:48:57.100,That suddenly made it like it was real.
00:49:00.562,00:49:03.190,This Manny character might actually be a real person.
00:49:14.868,00:49:16.745,to finally meet with my son.
00:49:17.037,00:49:21.041,"They brought him in the door, and the door shut, and my heart sank."
00:49:21.124,00:49:23.961,"I thought, Oh, there he is."
00:49:24.044,00:49:25.337,And I wanted to hug him so badly.
00:49:26.088,00:49:29.216,"And I put my hands up, and he put his hand up on the glass."
00:49:29.299,00:49:32.511,"And I said, I love you so much. I love you."
00:49:32.594,00:49:34.054,"And he said, I love you too."
00:49:41.228,00:49:42.104,Yes.
00:49:45.649,00:49:48.402,He told me that him and Jun Lin had met on Craigslist.
00:49:51.613,00:49:54.282,And they were both hooking up for casual sex.
00:49:54.366,00:49:55.993,"You know, a one-night stand."
00:49:56.827,00:50:01.999,But Manny knew that he was going to see a man that night and wanted to film it.
00:50:04.042,00:50:07.379,Luka was apprehensive and didn't want to.
00:50:09.006,00:50:14.636,"But Jun Lin had agreed with him that, Yeah, it's no big deal. We'll just videotape us having sex."
00:50:14.720,00:50:15.971,We're only having sex.
00:50:18.265,00:50:20.767,"Then, what happened, next, um..."
00:50:22.144,00:50:25.188,my son and I never spoke about the actual...
00:50:26.106,00:50:27.691,incident of what...
00:50:28.734,00:50:33.071,"how the murder took place, but I was told that..."
00:50:33.905,00:50:35.574,it was under Manny's direction.
00:50:37.451,00:50:41.913,"Manny was outside of the apartment in a black SUV, watching them."
00:50:44.124,00:50:47.711,Manny was repeatedly phoning and giving him orders.
00:50:50.922,00:50:52.758,You need to do what I tell you.
00:50:53.550,00:50:55.260,You know what I can do to you.
00:51:02.184,00:51:03.185,My son...
00:51:05.479,00:51:06.730,did as he was told.
00:51:18.033,00:51:28.960,"And then, the snuff video, it goes into Manny's hands, and he distributes it."
00:51:34.800,00:51:38.929,This was definitely being orchestrated by Emanuel Manny Lopez.
00:51:58.406,00:52:04.204,The 32-year-old has pleaded not guilty to the murder and dismemberment of a Chinese engineering student.
00:52:07.624,00:52:11.294,"We're, as a group, watching this all unfold."
00:52:15.132,00:52:19.845,And we find out that he was being analyzed by a psychiatrist.
00:52:24.391,00:52:29.604,"will counter the prosecution's portrayal of Magnotta as a cold, calculating killer."
00:52:35.026,00:52:37.904,"Luka is now coming forward saying, It's not me."
00:52:37.988,00:52:38.989,I'm the victim here.
00:52:39.072,00:52:42.784,I've been under the spell of this unknown Manny person.
00:52:45.704,00:52:47.205,"So, let me tell you who Manny is."
00:52:55.422,00:52:59.092,had this list of known aliases that he liked to use.
00:52:59.926,00:53:08.143,"Vladimir Romanov, Beverly Kent, Artemis Young, and Kirk Tramell."
00:53:09.853,00:53:17.235,"So typically, when Luka uses an alias when he makes a post, that's important because they mean something more."
00:53:20.238,00:53:24.326,"So, one of our group members looks up the name K. Tramell."
00:53:26.244,00:53:33.960,"And of course, the main character played by Sharon Stone in the movie Basic Instinct is called Catherine Tramell."
00:53:34.044,00:53:35.503,K. Tramell.
00:53:40.634,00:53:43.303,with Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas.
00:53:43.386,00:53:47.474,"So we were like, Oh, why don't we go look at that movie and see if there's any clues."
00:53:56.441,00:53:57.776,Miss Tramell?
00:53:59.653,00:54:02.530,"So, you start watching, and what do you see?"
00:54:05.325,00:54:11.248,You see a female straddling a naked body on a bed.
00:54:13.124,00:54:18.296,"Catherine Tramell is on top of her boyfriend, straddling him..."
00:54:19.547,00:54:24.552,"He's got his arms tied to the bedpost, and above him..."
00:54:24.636,00:54:26.930,"...is a, like, stained-glass window."
00:54:27.013,00:54:28.515,It's center frame.
00:54:31.768,00:54:35.897,"Holy shit, that looks exactly like the murder video."
00:54:51.329,00:54:53.164,just like the stained-glass window.
00:54:54.916,00:55:00.422,"And then, just like Luka, Catherine Tramell kills her lover with an ice pick."
00:55:03.883,00:55:07.554,Luka's making an homage to Basic Instinct.
00:55:11.766,00:55:15.270,"He liked Basic Instinct, loved all kinds of films."
00:55:21.484,00:55:24.446,Modified to look like an ice pick.
00:55:24.529,00:55:35.498,"In the e-mail that was sent to Alex West of The Sun, there's a specific line that's mentioned which is almost a direct rip-off of a line that Sharon Stone says."
00:55:36.249,00:55:37.834,Killing isn't like smoking.
00:55:39.127,00:55:40.337,You can quit.
00:55:44.966,00:55:46.343,Can I have a cigarette?
00:56:00.648,00:56:05.612,"Sharon Stone's character has an abusive ex-boyfriend, and his name is..."
00:56:07.822,00:56:10.200,formerly engaged to Manuel Vásquez.
00:56:10.450,00:56:13.119,Cheers. My friends call me Catherine.
00:56:13.912,00:56:15.246,What'd Manny Vásquez used to call you?
00:56:15.330,00:56:17.707,"-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Manny Vásquez? -Manny Vásquez."
00:56:17.791,00:56:19.542,-Manny Vásquez. -Manny Vásquez.
00:56:19.626,00:56:21.586,-Manny Vásquez? -Manny Vásquez.
00:56:21.920,00:56:22.754,Manny.
00:56:37.644,00:56:42.899,This Manny character is Luka's bullshit alibi.
00:56:43.817,00:56:48.154,"This is all just his fucking excuse, and he's been using this alibi for years."
00:56:48.780,00:56:49.823,What a con!
00:56:50.323,00:56:56.663,"Luka lives in a world where pop culture is king, and fame is king."
00:57:02.210,00:57:04.796,"I experienced, like, a holy crap moment."
00:57:05.505,00:57:11.428,"I went back to remembering where he said, Did anyone ever tell you, you look like Michael Douglas?"
00:57:11.511,00:57:13.221,Now it all made sense.
00:57:20.812,00:57:26.526,"and he was the star of this movie, and he wanted to be the star of the world."
00:57:29.696,00:57:36.786,"The phone records show that, that night, Mr. Magnotta did not receive or did not do any phone calls."
00:57:36.870,00:57:37.787,Nothing.
00:57:37.871,00:57:43.001,Nothing in the evidence revealed the existence of a Manny.
00:57:50.467,00:57:57.724,a possible defense a year and a half before the actual murder that he was planning.
00:57:58.183,00:58:05.315,And to have gone through this entire elaborate scheme is...
00:58:05.732,00:58:09.027,absolutely psychotic and brilliant at the same time.
00:58:37.889,00:58:39.390,Originally from Toronto...
00:58:43.645,00:58:46.689,"Take them a step further, and you have this case."
00:58:50.026,00:58:56.241,"everybody is talking about Luka Magnotta, but nobody has ever remembered Jun Lin."
00:58:56.616,00:58:59.160,Doesn't seem fair at all to my friend.
00:59:01.955,00:59:03.206,He doesn't deserve that.
00:59:05.625,00:59:08.753,Luka Magnotta didn't just kill the person...
00:59:10.463,00:59:13.633,but also destroyed the entire family's hope.
00:59:17.428,00:59:18.596,People don't understand.
00:59:18.680,00:59:21.891,"In the Chinese culture, it's always the son that carries..."
00:59:23.685,00:59:30.483,the responsibility to take care of the parents when they... when they become old.
00:59:32.235,00:59:34.404,Now it's gone.
00:59:35.029,00:59:36.072,And it's not fair.
00:59:48.334,00:59:49.502,"Hey, come on in."
00:59:51.921,00:59:59.095,"after all the things that we had been through together, I didn't actually meet John Green in person until after the murder and trial."
01:00:02.473,01:00:03.516,How are you?
01:00:06.394,01:00:07.645,-How about yourself? -Good.
01:00:12.108,01:00:14.277,I thought this was going to be a two-day thing.
01:00:14.360,01:00:17.905,"Two days, I thought, I'll join this group, take my mind off my breakup."
01:00:17.989,01:00:23.077,"I never imagined that we would be, you know, doing this for 18 months. You know?"
01:00:23.161,01:00:24.203,I'll never forget it.
01:00:24.287,01:00:27.624,"Every time that memory pops up on my Facebook, I'm like, Share again."
01:00:29.083,01:00:32.795,"Um, I just-- I'm... I'm glad that we went through it together."
01:00:33.129,01:00:36.007,-Yeah. -I might've actually given up without you.
01:00:36.633,01:00:38.926,-I might've given up. -I'm sure you would've. Sure you would've.
01:00:39.010,01:00:41.512,"-I'm sure you would have, too. -Nah, I don't know about that."
01:01:00.239,01:01:02.742,and that keeps me up sometimes at night is...
01:01:03.117,01:01:06.329,were we complicit in Luka's crimes?
01:01:07.997,01:01:12.543,Do you remember what Luka wrote at the murder scene on the inside of the closet?
01:01:13.961,01:01:17.090,"If you don't like the reflection, don't look in the mirror. I don't care."
01:01:17.757,01:01:19.550,I always wondered what that meant.
01:01:19.801,01:01:23.179,"When we look at ourselves in the mirror, are we proud of ourselves?"
01:01:23.846,01:01:26.265,Are we ashamed of what happened?
01:01:27.975,01:01:31.688,"You know, maybe I did exactly what Luka wanted."
01:01:34.357,01:01:35.566,Are we pawns?
01:01:36.067,01:01:39.654,Are we being used to help him tell his story?
01:01:40.321,01:01:41.948,What part did we have to play?
01:01:48.329,01:01:50.331,"we asked ourselves, Do we really want to do this?"
01:01:50.415,01:01:53.376,Do we really want to give him more airtime?
01:01:53.459,01:01:54.961,"Hi, my name is Luka."
01:01:55.378,01:01:56.796,Magnotta's my last name.
01:01:56.879,01:01:58.715,M-A-G-N-O-T-T-A.
01:02:07.640,01:02:09.851,So much that he was pushed to do what he did?
01:02:12.895,01:02:15.606,"Did we feed the monster, or did we create it?"
01:02:16.858,01:02:27.452,"And you, you at home watching a whole fucking documentary about Luka Magnotta, are you complicit?"
01:02:30.288,01:02:31.414,Perhaps it's time...
01:02:31.748,01:02:33.207,we turned off the machine.
