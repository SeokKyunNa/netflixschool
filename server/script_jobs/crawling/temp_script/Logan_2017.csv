00:00:58.958,00:01:00.916,No messing around.
00:01:01.083,00:01:03.208,"You mess those wheels up this time, Chong, I'm gonna have your ass."
00:01:03.291,00:01:04.291,Move!
00:01:04.916,00:01:07.125,"MAN 2: Right there, homes."
00:01:07.291,00:01:08.333,"MAN 1: Where's your party, boy?"
00:01:08.416,00:01:09.916,Turn down the radio.
00:01:10.083,00:01:11.416,"You inviting the cops, too, or what?"
00:01:11.541,00:01:12.625,MAN 2: I want el cromo.
00:01:14.250,00:01:17.250,"MAN 1: Gonna get some green for this shit right here, homes."
00:01:19.000,00:01:20.000,Fuck.
00:01:23.291,00:01:24.291,MAN 1: Hey.
00:01:39.375,00:01:40.416,"Uh, guys?"
00:01:41.791,00:01:44.250,Those are chrome-plated lugs.
00:01:44.416,00:01:45.416,"MAN 1: Look at this guy, eh?"
00:01:45.583,00:01:47.250,The plating flakes off.
00:01:47.416,00:01:48.500,Yeah?
00:01:48.666,00:01:50.041,This is a lease.
00:02:03.666,00:02:04.666,Shit.
00:02:09.166,00:02:10.291,"MAN 3: Come on, man."
00:02:14.416,00:02:16.208,"Uh, guys, guys."
00:02:16.333,00:02:17.500,MAN 1: What the fuck?
00:02:17.666,00:02:20.208,"Guys, seriously, you don't wanna do this."
00:02:23.833,00:02:25.208,MAN 1: Take him out.
00:02:31.833,00:02:33.000,MAN 1: Fuck him up!
00:02:41.750,00:02:43.583,No! Not the car!

00:02:56.250,00:02:57.375,Get him!
00:02:57.541,00:02:58.875,Hit that fool!
00:03:03.875,00:03:05.000,Motherfucker!
00:03:35.458,00:03:36.583,Shit.
00:03:57.541,00:03:58.833,Fuck.
00:04:49.333,00:04:51.291,"Everyone's asleep, Burt."
00:04:51.375,00:04:53.166,Sleepwalking.
00:04:51.375,00:04:55.666,"Between the ice caps, the pornographers, poisoned water, mutants..."
00:04:56.208,00:04:57.291,it's all connected.
00:04:57.375,00:04:59.791,"BURT: Hey, Clyde. It's 2029."
00:05:00.041,00:05:02.500,Why are we still talking about mutants?
00:05:03.000,00:05:05.416,"Hey, it's me. I'm in the car."
00:05:06.416,00:05:07.750,"Yeah, it was a good trip."
00:05:08.375,00:05:10.125,Killed it up and down the fence.
00:05:10.250,00:05:12.750,USA! USA! USA!
00:05:16.166,00:05:19.833,USA! USA! USA! USA!
00:05:46.916,00:05:48.250,GABRIELA: Wolverine.
00:05:50.208,00:05:51.208,I knew it was you.
00:05:52.208,00:05:53.708,"Oh, fuck."
00:05:54.000,00:05:55.541,I'm in trouble!
00:05:55.791,00:05:57.875,You're the only one that could help!
00:06:00.041,00:06:01.625,Get the fuck away from me!
00:06:08.833,00:06:10.166,Logan!
00:06:15.416,00:06:16.416,Who was that?
00:06:16.500,00:06:18.458,"I don't know, some crazy lady."
00:07:20.875,00:07:24.541,"As I live and breathe, the Wolverine."
00:07:25.125,00:07:26.791,And he's a junkie now.
00:07:27.000,00:07:28.458,Who the fuck are you?
00:07:29.750,00:07:32.125,"You know, you got some buckshot in your door."
00:07:32.458,00:07:33.958,I heard you was in Phoenix.
00:07:34.833,00:07:38.291,"But then, last night, some friends of mine in Texas HP called..."
00:07:38.458,00:07:42.000,and told me they found three dead cholos in a pullout on 54.
00:07:43.000,00:07:45.291,"Not unusual, I know."
00:07:45.458,00:07:47.958,"Except one was missing a hand, another one a leg."
00:07:49.041,00:07:50.500,So they was thinking...
00:07:50.666,00:07:53.708,it was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger.
00:07:54.500,00:07:56.291,But neither one of them can drive...
00:07:56.458,00:07:59.458,"one being fictional, the other one extinct."
00:07:59.625,00:08:03.791,And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a '24 Chrysler...
00:08:04.791,00:08:05.958,"and, well..."
00:08:06.458,00:08:08.500,this is a '24 Chrysler.
00:08:10.500,00:08:12.458,She found you yet?
00:08:12.625,00:08:13.791,Gabriela?
00:08:15.875,00:08:17.083,See...
00:08:17.250,00:08:19.750,"I'm not looking for you, Wolvie."
00:08:19.916,00:08:22.291,"Well, not really."
00:08:19.916,00:08:23.708,I'm looking for someone who's looking for you.
00:08:24.541,00:08:27.750,She took something of mine when I wasn't looking.
00:08:27.916,00:08:30.708,Something for which I am responsible.
00:08:32.250,00:08:33.500,Mexican lady.
00:08:34.500,00:08:36.375,Has her sights on you now.
00:08:39.000,00:08:40.208,Doesn't ring any bells?
00:08:40.375,00:08:42.875,"I don't know any Gabriela, so get the fuck out of my car."
00:08:43.708,00:08:44.708,Oh.
00:08:45.708,00:08:46.791,You know...
00:08:47.750,00:08:49.708,"I know what you're hiding, amigo."
00:08:50.333,00:08:53.000,The old cue ball south of the border.
00:08:53.708,00:08:54.875,What do you want?
00:08:55.041,00:08:56.666,A little co-operation.
00:09:05.416,00:09:07.625,"I'm a fan, by the way."
00:09:16.416,00:09:17.416,"Fuck, fuck!"
00:09:19.083,00:09:20.791,"LOGAN: No, Mr. Esperanza, no."
00:09:21.750,00:09:23.916,"I know I said June, but I need the boat now."
00:09:24.125,00:09:25.583,Why would that mean the price go up?
00:09:28.041,00:09:29.875,I know you wanted 70...
00:09:30.041,00:09:33.375,"Okay, what if I could put together $45,000 cash right now?"
00:09:33.541,00:09:35.083,Hello? Hello?
00:09:35.250,00:09:36.416,Shit.
00:09:39.666,00:09:40.916,"Hey, Sam."
00:09:41.083,00:09:42.083,Morning.
00:10:31.625,00:10:34.375,"CHARLES: I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus."
00:10:34.541,00:10:37.000,As well as I do know your outward favor.
00:10:37.166,00:10:39.500,"Well, honor is the subject of my story."
00:10:39.666,00:10:41.125,He's having a bad day.
00:10:41.291,00:10:42.666,LOGAN: They're all bad days.
00:10:43.708,00:10:45.666,He needed these six hours ago.
00:10:49.166,00:10:50.666,"This is not enough, you know."
00:10:51.791,00:10:53.166,Won't see us through the week.
00:10:53.333,00:10:54.500,I'm working on it.
00:10:56.833,00:10:57.833,Your turn.
00:10:58.541,00:11:00.125,I've had a rough night.
00:11:01.708,00:11:02.833,Poor you.
00:11:07.416,00:11:10.666,"In other news, he told me last night he's communicating with someone."
00:11:10.833,00:11:12.750,He's not talking to anybody.
00:11:12.916,00:11:14.208,Don't be so sure.
00:11:14.375,00:11:16.375,He's got all these details.
00:11:16.541,00:11:19.083,I thought that tank was supposed to act as a barrier.
00:11:19.250,00:11:20.416,It's got them cracks in it.
00:11:20.541,00:11:21.750,Just please stop.
00:11:22.375,00:11:23.375,Bottom left.
00:11:30.083,00:11:31.500,You're not listening.
00:11:31.666,00:11:34.916,He's been asking questions again about why we're here.
00:11:35.083,00:11:36.708,I think he's trying to read my mind.
00:11:36.875,00:11:38.208,That's what these are for.
00:11:40.750,00:11:46.583,CHARLES: Eating his curds and whey Then came a big spider Which sat down beside her And frightened Miss Muffet...
00:11:59.625,00:12:02.250,"Friends, I have good news for you today!"
00:12:02.416,00:12:03.791,It's not about what you do.
00:12:03.958,00:12:05.916,It's not about your deeds.
00:12:06.041,00:12:07.541,You can't live up to God's rules.
00:12:07.708,00:12:11.708,He knows that you can't.
00:12:13.875,00:12:15.416,"Make way, sir."
00:12:16.583,00:12:17.750,I said make way!
00:12:17.916,00:12:21.083,The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell!
00:12:21.250,00:12:23.583,Get it with chicken!
00:12:23.750,00:12:25.791,And with the cheese baked right in the shell...
00:12:26.000,00:12:27.791,it's the next big thing!
00:12:27.958,00:12:29.958,Go now while supplies last.
00:12:31.458,00:12:32.833,Who are you?
00:12:33.291,00:12:34.583,You know who I am.
00:12:34.750,00:12:37.083,You're the man who puts me to sleep.
00:12:37.250,00:12:38.458,We both could use some sleep.
00:12:38.625,00:12:40.000,No! No!
00:12:45.166,00:12:46.625,What are you doing to me?
00:12:46.708,00:12:47.708,Charles.
00:12:49.125,00:12:51.125,"Come on, now."
00:13:32.875,00:13:35.333,How long have I been here?
00:13:55.875,00:13:57.083,CHARLES: What are these?
00:13:57.250,00:13:58.375,LOGAN: You remember what they are.
00:13:58.541,00:14:00.500,The shots mellow the seizures.
00:14:00.583,00:14:02.250,The pills keep them from happening.
00:14:04.416,00:14:06.375,How about you blow on them to make them safe?
00:14:06.541,00:14:07.708,"Fuck off, Logan."
00:14:07.875,00:14:09.375,So you remember who I am now.
00:14:09.541,00:14:11.875,I always know who you are.
00:14:12.041,00:14:14.541,It's just sometimes I don't recognize you.
00:14:15.708,00:14:16.875,Take the pills.
00:14:22.708,00:14:25.416,You leave me alone with that fucking albino.
00:14:25.583,00:14:27.041,He doesn't listen to me.
00:14:28.041,00:14:30.375,I know a damn speciation when I see one.
00:14:30.541,00:14:31.541,A what?
00:14:31.750,00:14:34.750,Speciation.
00:14:35.583,00:14:36.666,There are forces trying to kill them.
00:14:36.750,00:14:38.583,Forces?
00:14:41.416,00:14:43.791,It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.
00:14:43.958,00:14:46.583,"They don't want me, they want you."
00:14:48.291,00:14:52.125,"Oh, yes, that's how fucking stupid they are."
00:14:53.291,00:14:56.125,They're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty.
00:14:56.291,00:14:59.916,"The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago, Charles, a long time."
00:15:00.541,00:15:03.083,There are no new mutants.
00:15:03.250,00:15:06.458,Hasn't been a new one born in 25 years. Not anywhere.
00:15:06.625,00:15:08.083,You always thought...
00:15:09.041,00:15:10.916,we were part of God's plan.
00:15:14.833,00:15:15.833,But maybe...
00:15:16.916,00:15:19.500,Maybe we were God's mistake.
00:15:29.125,00:15:32.083,What a disappointment you are.
00:15:34.916,00:15:36.125,When I found you...
00:15:36.291,00:15:40.125,you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.
00:15:40.458,00:15:43.500,A warm capper to a life as an assassin.
00:15:43.666,00:15:45.916,Hooked on barbiturates.
00:15:46.083,00:15:48.291,You were an animal.
00:15:49.625,00:15:51.000,But we took you in.
00:15:52.125,00:15:54.791,I gave you a family.
00:15:55.291,00:15:56.291,And they're gone now.
00:15:56.375,00:15:57.375,Logan.
00:15:58.833,00:15:59.833,Logan...
00:16:02.000,00:16:03.500,What did you do?
00:16:05.875,00:16:07.166,What did you do?
00:16:07.333,00:16:09.458,Answer me!
00:16:09.625,00:16:11.333,No one should live like this.
00:16:11.500,00:16:12.958,Drugged in a fucking tank!
00:16:13.125,00:16:14.166,It's for your own good.
00:16:14.333,00:16:15.375,"No, it's not!"
00:16:18.666,00:16:21.083,You're waiting for me to die.
00:18:02.333,00:18:03.666,I don't wanna fight...
00:18:03.833,00:18:06.458,but there's things we need to discuss.
00:18:07.791,00:18:08.916,What things?
00:18:10.708,00:18:12.958,"Well, would it be considered nagging..."
00:18:13.416,00:18:15.750,if I was to repeat my previous observation...
00:18:15.916,00:18:18.458,that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures?
00:18:20.458,00:18:22.250,It's what the guy gave me.
00:18:22.416,00:18:24.666,Wasn't in a position to make demands.
00:18:24.833,00:18:26.291,I almost died this morning.
00:18:26.458,00:18:27.833,That seizure was...
00:18:28.000,00:18:29.958,It felt a lot longer than a minute.
00:18:30.125,00:18:31.458,You're less affected.
00:18:31.625,00:18:33.500,You know he needs a higher dose.
00:18:33.666,00:18:36.458,And I know you got more money squirreled away.
00:18:36.625,00:18:37.750,That money's to get us out of here.
00:18:37.916,00:18:39.625,"No, not us."
00:18:39.791,00:18:41.458,You're saving to buy a Sunseeker.
00:18:41.666,00:18:43.000,Sun is the keyword.
00:18:43.166,00:18:46.333,I hardly see myself cowering below decks like Nosferatu.
00:18:46.500,00:18:47.500,Do you?
00:18:47.666,00:18:51.458,"Folding your underpants, and making him spotted dick."
00:18:55.791,00:18:56.791,Found this in your pocket.
00:19:01.541,00:19:03.166,If you are planning to blow your brains out...
00:19:03.333,00:19:05.000,could you wait till you're out on the high seas?
00:19:05.166,00:19:06.416,I just mopped these floors.
00:19:06.541,00:19:07.875,I don't need this shit.
00:19:18.000,00:19:20.958,"A year ago, you asked me to help you."
00:19:22.166,00:19:23.875,And God knows I've tried.
00:19:25.041,00:19:27.708,"But I can't help you, Logan, not really..."
00:19:28.666,00:19:30.375,if you're not going to talk to me.
00:19:31.875,00:19:34.041,I hear you at night.
00:19:34.208,00:19:35.875,You don't wanna talk about that.
00:19:37.875,00:19:39.750,Or the booze you're drinking.
00:19:40.375,00:19:42.833,Or the pus you're wiping away from your knuckles.
00:19:43.541,00:19:45.875,Or the blood I wash from your clothes.
00:19:46.208,00:19:48.416,Or the fresh wounds in your chest.
00:19:48.875,00:19:50.875,The ones that aren't healing.
00:19:51.416,00:19:52.500,And I'm pretty sure...
00:19:52.583,00:19:55.583,you don't wanna talk about the fact that you can't read the label on that bottle.
00:19:57.208,00:19:58.500,"It says, Ibuprofen."
00:20:00.583,00:20:01.750,That was my favorite mug.
00:20:02.250,00:20:04.083,Stay out of my shit.
00:20:06.291,00:20:07.750,"Something's happening to you, Logan."
00:20:07.916,00:20:10.541,On the inside you're sick.
00:20:16.875,00:20:18.541,BRIDESMAID: Best night ever!
00:20:20.750,00:20:21.958,"Hey, driver."
00:20:39.458,00:20:42.541,WOMAN: I love you.
00:20:42.708,00:20:44.375,You're such a doll.
00:21:41.500,00:21:42.666,Mr. Logan.
00:21:42.833,00:21:43.875,"Oh, Jesus."
00:21:44.000,00:21:45.666,Please. We need a ride.
00:21:45.833,00:21:47.708,Not available.
00:21:47.875,00:21:48.875,My name is Gabriela Lopez.
00:21:49.000,00:21:50.000,"I don't wanna know your name, lady."
00:21:50.166,00:21:51.625,There are men after us.
00:21:51.791,00:21:53.125,We need to get out of here.
00:21:53.291,00:21:55.041,"Go north, cross to Canada."
00:21:55.208,00:21:56.708,Anyone can do that job.
00:21:56.875,00:21:57.875,"I'll give you $50,000."
00:21:58.833,00:22:00.125,"How did you find me, huh?"
00:22:00.208,00:22:01.833,"'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady!"
00:22:02.000,00:22:04.208,"The people after you, they're on my ass now!"
00:22:04.375,00:22:06.500,Sightings were posted.
00:22:06.666,00:22:07.708,"Laura, go inside."
00:22:07.833,00:22:09.000,What sightings?
00:22:09.125,00:22:13.000,"People said someone who looked like the Wolverine was in El Paso, driving."
00:22:13.166,00:22:14.708,Said he looked old.
00:22:17.875,00:22:18.958,WOMAN: Hey!
00:22:19.166,00:22:21.083,I told you to stop it with that ball!
00:22:21.250,00:22:22.375,Bad girl!
00:22:22.541,00:22:24.083,"I told you, bad girl!"
00:22:24.250,00:22:25.250,Mamacita's gonna have to pay for that.
00:22:25.375,00:22:26.375,"Stop, please. No."
00:22:28.625,00:22:29.708,Shit!
00:22:32.041,00:22:33.458,They're gonna have to pay for damages.
00:22:34.875,00:22:36.416,And she has cash.
00:22:36.583,00:22:37.541,I've seen it.
00:22:37.708,00:22:39.250,You should get your fat ass back in your office.
00:22:39.416,00:22:40.416,You'll get your money.
00:22:43.333,00:22:45.333,"Don't let her call anyone, please."
00:22:45.500,00:22:47.541,They will find us.
00:22:55.708,00:22:57.083,I am a nurse.
00:22:58.416,00:23:00.791,Was. In Mexico City.
00:23:02.250,00:23:03.416,When did that happen?
00:23:03.625,00:23:06.958,This morning.
00:23:10.625,00:23:11.916,"I got away from them, but..."
00:23:14.250,00:23:15.250,...now they know my car.
00:23:19.000,00:23:21.375,"Look, I gotta go."
00:23:21.541,00:23:23.750,"No, wait. Please. Here."
00:23:24.083,00:23:25.291,"Please, wait! Look."
00:23:25.458,00:23:28.208,"Look. Here, take this."
00:23:28.708,00:23:30.541,Here. Take us to this address.
00:23:31.916,00:23:34.125,"You can have $30,000 more when we get there."
00:23:35.458,00:23:37.625,My friends there will give it to you.
00:23:38.125,00:23:39.583,They will be waiting.
00:23:40.666,00:23:42.000,They will give you anything.
00:23:43.125,00:23:44.291,Where did you get this?
00:23:44.458,00:23:45.791,My boyfriend.
00:23:46.750,00:23:49.291,He wants to kill me and take her.
00:23:52.458,00:23:53.958,And that's your daughter?
00:23:55.958,00:23:56.958,Yes.
00:24:00.625,00:24:03.125,I know you're still good inside.
00:24:03.291,00:24:04.291,I know you want to help us.
00:24:04.416,00:24:05.375,You don't know anything about me.
00:24:05.458,00:24:06.458,Please!
00:24:06.583,00:24:09.833,"I promise, there will be no problems if we leave now."
00:24:10.000,00:24:11.916,I can't just leave to North Dakota!
00:24:12.083,00:24:13.583,We have to be there Friday.
00:24:13.750,00:24:16.291,Or we miss our chance to cross.
00:24:16.958,00:24:18.000,Please.
00:24:19.041,00:24:20.166,You have to. Please.
00:24:23.666,00:24:24.791,Please.
00:24:32.333,00:24:34.041,I like those.
00:24:34.208,00:24:35.916,They make you look younger.
00:24:40.333,00:24:41.708,"Charles, listen."
00:24:42.583,00:24:44.375,"I gotta go away for a few days, okay?"
00:24:45.750,00:24:47.333,I got a long ride for some good money...
00:24:47.500,00:24:49.375,"but when I get back, we're gonna get outta here."
00:24:50.000,00:24:51.500,We're gonna drive down to Yelapa.
00:24:51.583,00:24:52.666,We're gonna get ourselves a boat.
00:24:53.333,00:24:54.833,And we're gonna go live on the ocean.
00:24:55.000,00:24:57.000,Will you be safe there?
00:24:58.708,00:25:01.541,Yeah. We'll be safe.
00:25:01.708,00:25:03.291,"Look what Logan got us, Charles."
00:25:09.708,00:25:10.875,Be back in a few days.
00:25:54.083,00:25:55.250,Shit.
00:26:26.625,00:26:28.000,Logan.
00:26:28.166,00:26:29.291,What happened?
00:26:29.458,00:26:30.875,Did something go wrong?
00:26:31.041,00:26:32.500,The job was wrong to begin with.
00:26:53.000,00:26:54.000,Logan!
00:26:57.333,00:26:58.458,Logan!
00:26:58.625,00:26:59.666,What?
00:27:02.291,00:27:03.833,Who does this belong to?
00:27:09.375,00:27:10.500,Who's that?
00:27:14.541,00:27:17.000,Thought you were supposed to see shit coming.
00:27:17.166,00:27:18.333,I can track mutants.
00:27:18.500,00:27:20.541,"I'm a glorified truffle pig, not a clairvoyant."
00:27:20.708,00:27:22.375,Go inside and keep Charles quiet.
00:27:22.500,00:27:23.833,Go inside now!
00:27:33.083,00:27:34.958,"You need to turn around, asshole."
00:27:35.041,00:27:36.041,This is private property.
00:27:36.208,00:27:37.416,"Yes, it is."
00:27:38.375,00:27:41.500,"In fact, I believe it belongs to a multinational smelting company..."
00:27:41.666,00:27:43.083,based in Shanghai.
00:27:44.708,00:27:46.958,Where are you keeping the old man? Hmm?
00:27:47.125,00:27:48.541,Is he over there?
00:27:51.208,00:27:52.416,Or is he there?
00:27:53.541,00:27:54.583,That'd be smart.
00:27:56.083,00:27:58.375,I'd like to meet him.
00:27:58.541,00:28:03.291,I'm told the HSA classifies his brain as a weapon of mass destruction now.
00:28:04.750,00:28:06.250,"Damn shame, what happened back east."
00:28:07.208,00:28:08.708,He's been dead for a year.
00:28:10.916,00:28:12.041,I need the girl.
00:28:12.208,00:28:13.208,What girl?
00:28:13.375,00:28:15.458,The one that goes along with that ball you're holding.
00:28:16.041,00:28:17.583,There's no girl here.
00:28:17.750,00:28:19.375,I know you went to the motel.
00:28:19.541,00:28:20.791,"Yeah, I was called there."
00:28:20.958,00:28:22.875,There was no girl.
00:28:23.041,00:28:25.541,Just the woman.
00:28:28.416,00:28:29.916,"So, you saw Gabriela."
00:28:31.250,00:28:34.500,But you didn't call me.
00:28:36.083,00:28:37.625,"You didn't shoot the poor thing, did you?"
00:28:37.791,00:28:38.916,"No, did you?"
00:28:39.041,00:28:40.083,I asked you first.
00:28:40.250,00:28:41.375,I don't like guns.
00:28:41.500,00:28:42.625,Of course.
00:28:43.416,00:28:46.166,"I wish you'd called me, Logan."
00:28:46.333,00:28:47.500,Like I asked.
00:28:50.625,00:28:51.833,See?
00:28:52.000,00:28:54.000,You're not the only one that's been enhanced.
00:29:02.250,00:29:03.916,Logan. Logan!
00:29:04.083,00:29:06.083,This is Laura.
00:29:06.791,00:29:07.791,"Caliban, come!"
00:29:08.333,00:29:10.791,This is who I've been telling you about.
00:29:10.958,00:29:12.625,This is Laura.
00:29:13.458,00:29:15.208,We've been waiting for you.
00:29:20.291,00:29:21.291,"Come, come here."
00:29:22.458,00:29:23.833,It's okay.
00:29:24.291,00:29:25.291,Come.
00:29:26.833,00:29:28.041,Laura.
00:29:31.208,00:29:32.666,It's okay. It's okay.
00:29:34.791,00:29:35.791,Come.
00:29:36.041,00:29:37.041,Come.
00:29:38.666,00:29:42.291,Come. It's okay.
00:29:42.791,00:29:43.791,It's safe.
00:29:44.291,00:29:45.541,We can look after you here.
00:29:46.125,00:29:47.125,Come on.
00:29:48.958,00:29:51.208,Looks like ex-military.
00:29:51.416,00:29:52.416,Worse.
00:29:53.708,00:29:54.833,Is he by himself?
00:29:55.000,00:29:56.083,"Yeah, not for long."
00:29:57.000,00:30:00.000,"You get him back in his ride, take him out to the wash and dump him."
00:30:00.166,00:30:01.875,What if he wakes up before I get there?
00:30:07.041,00:30:09.166,Text me where you are.
00:30:22.833,00:30:23.833,Yes.
00:30:28.000,00:30:29.041,Logan.
00:30:29.833,00:30:31.375,Logan.
00:30:32.416,00:30:35.708,You'll get it back after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into.
00:30:35.875,00:30:37.125,"No, Logan."
00:30:37.291,00:30:38.250,I think the...
00:30:47.625,00:30:50.333,"Logan, the woman that you met, that's not her mother."
00:30:51.208,00:30:53.625,So she talks?
00:30:53.791,00:30:55.041,Communicating.
00:30:56.625,00:30:57.916,Take these now.
00:30:59.291,00:31:01.458,We have to get out of here.
00:31:01.625,00:31:03.708,"And you can't have an attack out there, you understand?"
00:31:04.333,00:31:08.083,"Yes, but this is the mutant that I told you about."
00:31:08.250,00:31:10.000,She needs our help.
00:31:10.166,00:31:11.250,"Yes, she is!"
00:31:11.375,00:31:12.500,"What's her gift, Charles?"
00:31:12.666,00:31:14.125,Eating? Pipe throwing?
00:31:17.208,00:31:18.250,It's okay.
00:31:38.750,00:31:39.833,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:39.958,00:31:41.875,Take the gun.
00:31:42.041,00:31:44.083,Text me when you're on the way back.
00:31:44.250,00:31:45.458,You have anything else you need?
00:31:45.625,00:31:47.250,Food for the kid?
00:31:53.541,00:31:55.166,"You're fucked now, mutie."
00:32:05.500,00:32:06.708,It's okay.
00:32:08.500,00:32:10.666,CHARLES: Choo-choo.
00:32:14.416,00:32:16.333,It's okay. Sit down.
00:32:16.500,00:32:17.791,We gotta go.
00:32:17.958,00:32:19.541,What's going on? Where?
00:32:19.708,00:32:21.208,Don't move.
00:32:22.083,00:32:24.708,"Hey, don't worry."
00:32:28.833,00:32:31.583,"Logan, the girl."
00:32:36.666,00:32:39.041,"Logan, what about the girl?"
00:32:40.666,00:32:41.833,Logan.
00:32:48.291,00:32:50.583,"Logan, we mustn't forget about Laura."
00:32:50.750,00:32:52.083,She's not our problem.
00:33:00.541,00:33:01.666,Shit!
00:33:10.125,00:33:11.125,"Ah, shit!"
00:33:39.875,00:33:40.958,Logan.
00:33:41.125,00:33:42.208,"Yeah, I'm thinking."
00:33:42.375,00:33:43.500,The child.
00:33:44.250,00:33:45.875,"Logan, we mustn't forget Laura."
00:33:46.041,00:33:47.250,Please be quiet.
00:33:51.458,00:33:52.500,Huh.
00:33:52.583,00:33:54.416,Charles Xavier.
00:33:54.958,00:33:56.875,America's most wanted octogenarian.
00:33:57.041,00:33:58.541,"I'm a nonagenarian, actually."
00:34:04.625,00:34:05.625,Ah.
00:34:07.541,00:34:08.541,Where's Caliban?
00:34:10.500,00:34:12.041,Why don't you tell me where the girl is first?
00:34:12.208,00:34:14.125,Or I could ask Cue Ball.
00:34:14.291,00:34:15.750,"I told you, she's not here."
00:34:15.916,00:34:18.208,"Where's Caliban, motherfucker?"
00:34:19.458,00:34:21.750,"Well, I left him in the same ditch he was gonna leave me in."
00:34:38.166,00:34:41.416,"Jesus, Wolverine, seeing you like this just breaks my damn heart."
00:34:41.625,00:34:43.541,"As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick."
00:34:51.708,00:34:52.791,Go get her.
00:36:05.958,00:36:07.041,Laura.
00:36:11.458,00:36:12.958,That a girl!
00:36:14.375,00:36:15.375,"Hey, baby."
00:36:24.708,00:36:26.000,Laura...
00:36:28.958,00:36:30.041,Laura!
00:36:30.458,00:36:33.166,"Honey, you wanna stay where you are."
00:36:33.791,00:36:35.208,"You wanna see your friends, right?"
00:36:36.791,00:36:38.125,"Command, stop."
00:36:39.000,00:36:40.625,You said alive or dead.
00:36:41.916,00:36:42.916,Laura!
00:36:44.583,00:36:45.583,Laura.
00:36:47.000,00:36:48.375,Laura.
00:36:48.541,00:36:50.250,No. No.
00:36:51.958,00:36:53.541,Move! Go!
00:36:59.250,00:37:00.458,Move! Go!
00:37:04.666,00:37:06.416,Stop shooting!
00:37:06.583,00:37:09.708,She heals! Move! Go!
00:37:11.416,00:37:12.875,Holy shit!
00:37:57.375,00:37:58.458,Gotcha!
00:38:06.833,00:38:08.208,Ah!
00:38:09.791,00:38:10.916,"Come on, hold her down."
00:39:03.083,00:39:05.625,"As I told you, Logan, she's a mutant like you."
00:39:06.083,00:39:07.125,Hold on!
00:39:10.250,00:39:11.500,Very much like you.
00:39:33.583,00:39:34.833,"Laura, are you all right?"
00:39:46.541,00:39:47.625,Ahh!
00:39:53.791,00:39:54.791,Move!
00:40:03.708,00:40:04.708,Hold on!
00:40:10.541,00:40:12.333,Fuck! Come on!
00:40:13.958,00:40:14.958,Come on!
00:40:22.041,00:40:23.125,Shit.
00:41:15.625,00:41:17.458,Fall in! Let's go!
00:41:24.333,00:41:25.583,"CHARLES: Oh, watch out!"
00:41:25.916,00:41:26.916,Ah!
00:42:09.666,00:42:10.750,Sit back.
00:42:20.208,00:42:21.500,Bring me the tracker.
00:42:29.000,00:42:30.041,You.
00:42:31.875,00:42:33.291,Who the hell are you?
00:42:34.708,00:42:37.625,Hey! I asked you a question.
00:42:38.791,00:42:40.416,"You know who she is, Logan."
00:42:41.250,00:42:42.333,"No, I don't."
00:42:42.500,00:42:44.708,Does she remind you of anybody?
00:43:16.291,00:43:18.541,I read about you when I was a kid.
00:43:20.333,00:43:22.083,I believe you're thinking of someone else.
00:43:22.166,00:43:23.166,Hmm.
00:43:30.416,00:43:34.625,"Now, if I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team."
00:43:35.166,00:43:37.875,You were helping round up all those old mutes.
00:43:38.791,00:43:40.083,What changed?
00:43:41.416,00:43:42.458,You got religion?
00:43:46.500,00:43:50.083,I'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys...
00:43:51.916,00:43:55.375,and track one more special mute for me.
00:43:59.500,00:44:00.750,I'm not helping you.
00:44:01.416,00:44:02.916,"Of course, you'd say that."
00:44:03.583,00:44:06.458,But I got a theory that people don't really change.
00:44:10.083,00:44:11.375,Beware of the light.
00:44:13.041,00:44:16.875,"Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you every day when you was a kid."
00:44:23.125,00:44:24.416,Beware of the light.
00:44:30.333,00:44:33.041,"Now, let's not bring out the worst in each other."
00:44:33.166,00:44:34.708,"The girl is not worth it, trust me."
00:44:35.000,00:44:37.208,She's not a natural fuck-up like you.
00:44:37.375,00:44:40.041,"She's a business mistake, a R&amp;D gone bad."
00:44:40.208,00:44:41.416,There's liability.
00:44:41.708,00:44:45.041,"They can't have things with patents running around, hurting people, can they?"
00:44:46.208,00:44:49.708,We need to get her off the board before she hurts anybody else.
00:44:49.875,00:44:52.541,"Someone you care about, maybe."
00:45:00.083,00:45:01.416,"So, get to sniffin'."
00:45:05.875,00:45:07.916,My name is Gabriela Lopez.
00:45:08.541,00:45:09.583,I am a nurse.
00:45:09.750,00:45:13.958,"And for 10 years, I worked for Transigen Research in Mexico City."
00:45:15.166,00:45:17.833,Transigen is owned by an American company.
00:45:21.208,00:45:23.666,What I am about to show you is illegal...
00:45:24.000,00:45:26.250,in the U.S. and Canada.
00:45:33.833,00:45:36.041,They told us we were part of a pharmaceutical study.
00:45:36.500,00:45:38.208,"But, of course, that was a lie."
00:45:38.375,00:45:41.625,These children were born in Transigen.
00:45:42.791,00:45:44.166,They were born here...
00:45:44.333,00:45:46.708,and have never left.
00:45:46.875,00:45:49.416,They have never seen the sun or the ocean...
00:45:50.291,00:45:51.791,rain or snow...
00:45:53.166,00:45:54.875,or any of God's creatures.
00:45:55.791,00:45:57.708,They have no birth certificates...
00:45:58.208,00:45:59.625,no names...
00:46:00.500,00:46:02.125,besides the ones we have given them.
00:46:05.208,00:46:09.125,They were raised in the bellies of Mexican girls.
00:46:09.291,00:46:11.208,Girls no one can find anymore.
00:46:11.916,00:46:15.208,Their fathers are semillas geneticas...
00:46:15.375,00:46:16.833,special seeds in bottles.
00:46:31.375,00:46:32.916,Birthday? No birth.
00:46:33.875,00:46:35.625,We do not dress them up for Halloween.
00:46:36.333,00:46:38.916,We do not call them baby or kiss boo-boos.
00:46:39.750,00:46:40.833,Don't think of them as children.
00:46:40.916,00:46:42.000,Think of them as things...
00:46:42.083,00:46:43.583,with patents and copyrights.
00:46:43.666,00:46:44.666,Comprende?
00:46:44.791,00:46:45.791,"Si, senor."
00:46:46.500,00:46:49.458,GABRIELA: They thought we were too poor and stupid to understand.
00:46:50.125,00:46:52.041,"We're poor, yes..."
00:46:52.208,00:46:53.250,but we are not stupid.
00:46:53.333,00:46:54.500,TRAINER: Use your powers.
00:47:01.791,00:47:03.125,GABRIELA: This is business.
00:47:03.291,00:47:05.750,They are making soldiers.
00:47:06.333,00:47:07.375,Killers.
00:47:13.333,00:47:15.458,These are babies of mutantes...
00:47:23.250,00:47:24.250,CHARLES: North Dakota.
00:47:24.375,00:47:25.375,LOGAN: Mmm.
00:47:25.791,00:47:27.708,You took that woman's money.
00:47:27.875,00:47:30.291,You said you would take the child there.
00:47:35.708,00:47:37.208,What is she?
00:47:38.625,00:47:40.291,"She's your daughter, Logan."
00:47:42.375,00:47:44.125,Alkali has your genetic code.
00:47:44.291,00:47:45.458,Not just mine.
00:47:45.541,00:47:46.541,Logan...
00:47:46.625,00:47:47.625,I don't want to talk about it.
00:47:47.708,00:47:48.875,I don't wanna hear about it anymore.
00:47:48.958,00:47:50.375,Logan...
00:47:50.875,00:47:52.375,I have to pee.
00:48:05.416,00:48:06.416,Last ride.
00:48:10.916,00:48:12.000,You're welcome.
00:48:18.583,00:48:19.833,CHARLES: Stop it.
00:48:18.583,00:48:21.291,"For God's sake, I can do this myself!"
00:48:21.458,00:48:22.458,"LOGAN: Yeah, well, you're not doing it."
00:48:22.583,00:48:23.708,Just get on with it.
00:48:23.791,00:48:25.333,Not with you standing there.
00:48:25.500,00:48:27.083,"Trust me, I'm not lookin'."
00:49:01.083,00:49:02.083,STORE CLERK: Hello.
00:49:02.708,00:49:03.833,"Hi, there!"
00:49:04.291,00:49:05.708,"You know you gotta pay for that, right?"
00:49:07.791,00:49:10.375,"Hey! Where's your mommy and daddy, huh?"
00:49:13.791,00:49:14.791,Come on.
00:49:14.958,00:49:16.041,"That's enough. These, too."
00:49:18.375,00:49:19.416,Shit!
00:49:19.625,00:49:20.666,Not okay!
00:49:23.833,00:49:25.041,Sorry.
00:49:26.125,00:49:27.791,"Um, do you sell phone chargers?"
00:49:28.375,00:49:29.500,Uh...
00:49:35.000,00:49:36.166,Come on. Get in the car.
00:50:02.791,00:50:04.708,GABRIELA: As the children became older...
00:50:04.875,00:50:06.875,Laura. Laura.
00:50:07.416,00:50:09.208,...they became more difficult.
00:50:11.541,00:50:13.375,They could not be controlled.
00:50:15.791,00:50:19.041,The company made their bodies into weapons.
00:50:19.916,00:50:21.875,Tried to teach them to kill.
00:50:22.041,00:50:24.333,But they did not want to fight.
00:50:27.041,00:50:29.875,A soldier who will not fight is useless.
00:50:31.958,00:50:33.875,Inside this building...
00:50:34.041,00:50:35.208,they are working on something new.
00:50:36.083,00:50:39.041,Something they think is better than the children.
00:50:39.666,00:50:42.041,Something they say is without a soul.
00:50:42.208,00:50:43.750,"MAN: Would you like to hear my full lab report, Dr. Rice?"
00:50:43.833,00:50:45.500,DR. RICE: You can't get good sushi here.
00:50:45.750,00:50:47.750,"It's the Mexican equivalent of Denver, Colorado."
00:50:50.083,00:50:51.625,GABRIELA: They must have been successful.
00:50:52.500,00:50:54.916,"About a week ago, they told us to shut our program down."
00:50:57.833,00:51:00.250,They started putting the children to sleep.
00:51:03.666,00:51:06.625,We are going to save as many children as we can.
00:51:06.958,00:51:09.041,"I read about a place, up north."
00:51:09.458,00:51:11.250,A place for mutants.
00:51:11.416,00:51:12.583,They call it Eden.
00:51:27.166,00:51:29.291,GABRIELA: If you are watching this...
00:51:29.458,00:51:31.291,it means that I am dead.
00:51:32.375,00:51:35.625,I am not sure if any other children survived.
00:51:35.791,00:51:38.125,We were separated.
00:51:38.291,00:51:40.291,There is no more money.
00:51:40.458,00:51:42.125,That was a lie.
00:51:43.625,00:51:45.208,She's not my child.
00:51:46.708,00:51:48.166,But I love her.
00:51:49.333,00:51:51.666,You may not love her.
00:51:53.291,00:51:55.666,But she is your child.
00:51:56.791,00:51:59.375,Please. I beg you...
00:51:59.625,00:52:01.791,take her to safety.
00:52:48.875,00:52:51.125,Is this where we're hiding out?
00:52:51.791,00:52:52.875,LOGAN: We're not hiding out.
00:52:53.041,00:52:55.083,We're gonna get a couple of hours' sleep...
00:52:55.250,00:52:59.041,"clean up, get some new clothes, get a new ride and get outta here."
00:53:04.541,00:53:07.416,Harrah's Hotel and Casino welcomes you to Oklahoma City.
00:53:08.125,00:53:11.041,Please keep right for valet parking.
00:53:11.125,00:53:12.166,LOGAN: Hey.
00:53:12.250,00:53:13.791,The fun never stops at Harrah's Hotel and Casino.
00:53:13.958,00:53:16.375,"Hey, keep it out front, all right?"
00:53:22.750,00:53:24.208,"Come on, let's go."
00:53:51.166,00:53:52.333,"Hey, Laura."
00:53:52.500,00:53:53.583,Let's go.
00:53:53.666,00:53:54.791,We need clothes.
00:54:07.416,00:54:08.666,FEMALE VOICE: Going up.
00:54:10.791,00:54:12.791,"No, no, stop. Not a toy."
00:54:13.833,00:54:15.125,"Uh, no, no, sorry, chair."
00:54:15.250,00:54:16.500,What? Okay.
00:54:16.958,00:54:18.125,Push up again.
00:54:18.291,00:54:19.375,FEMALE VOICE: Going up.
00:54:19.541,00:54:21.666,Come here. Stand there.
00:54:22.708,00:54:24.750,"Logan, it's yours."
00:54:24.833,00:54:25.875,What?
00:54:25.958,00:54:27.000,I'm not gonna wear it now.
00:54:27.125,00:54:28.125,In the room. We'll get changed in the room.
00:54:30.541,00:54:31.958,"You're a low-down, lying Yankee."
00:54:33.166,00:54:34.208,Prove it.
00:54:42.875,00:54:45.625,"This is a very famous picture, Laura."
00:54:45.791,00:54:47.500,It's almost 100 years old.
00:55:21.083,00:55:25.875,I first saw this picture at the Essoldo Cinema in my hometown...
00:55:26.041,00:55:28.166,when I was your age.
00:55:28.333,00:55:47.250,"ALL: ...who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come, thy will be done Shit."
00:56:28.291,00:56:31.916,"that you're a low-down, Yankee liar."
00:56:32.125,00:56:33.416,WILSON: Prove it.
00:56:42.458,00:56:44.083,You read these in your spare time?
00:56:45.791,00:56:47.833,"Oh, yeah, Charles, we got ourselves an X-Men fan."
00:56:48.750,00:56:50.458,"You do know they're all bullshit, right?"
00:56:50.583,00:56:53.541,"Maybe a quarter of it happened, and not like this."
00:56:54.541,00:56:55.791,"In the real world, people die."
00:56:55.958,00:56:59.416,And no self-promoting asshole in a fucking leotard can stop it.
00:56:59.583,00:57:01.541,This is ice cream for bed-wetters.
00:57:01.708,00:57:03.000,Her nurse has been feeding her some grade-A bullshit.
00:57:03.166,00:57:06.041,I don't think Laura needs reminding of life's impermanence.
00:57:07.541,00:57:09.875,Didn't you say something about finding us a new ride?
00:57:11.208,00:57:13.000,Two more pills in one hour.
00:57:13.916,00:57:15.041,Give 'em to him.
00:57:18.208,00:57:20.250,"A man has to be what he is, Joey."
00:57:21.541,00:57:23.333,Can't break the mold.
00:57:23.500,00:57:25.791,I tried it and it didn't work for me.
00:57:25.958,00:57:28.291,"Joey, there's no living with a killing."
00:57:28.458,00:57:30.375,There's no going back from one.
00:57:30.541,00:57:32.791,"Right or wrong, it's a brand."
00:57:33.000,00:57:34.458,A brand sticks.
00:57:35.541,00:57:38.750,"Now you run on home to your mother, and tell her everything's all right."
00:57:39.958,00:57:43.083,And there aren't any more guns in the valley.
00:58:03.750,00:58:04.958,STORE CLERK: Who are you guys?
00:58:05.500,00:58:08.291,More cops? 'Cause I told the other guys everything that I...
00:58:18.208,00:58:20.541,MAN: Get up!
00:58:20.750,00:58:22.416,You did your job.
00:58:44.083,00:58:45.500,LOGAN: Fellas.
00:58:58.708,00:59:00.250,Shit.
00:59:01.791,00:59:03.125,Knock yourselves out.
00:59:05.208,00:59:06.500,WOMAN: I'll tell you what.
00:59:06.666,00:59:08.916,"I'll have her freshly painted for you, new tires..."
00:59:09.083,00:59:10.666,"mounted, balanced, and complete paperwork."
00:59:10.833,00:59:13.583,"I'll give you 10 as-is, if you can forget the paperwork."
00:59:15.416,00:59:17.625,"Well, you still need new tires, man, they're bald."
00:59:17.791,00:59:18.916,How long will that take?
00:59:19.083,00:59:20.083,An hour.
00:59:52.708,00:59:53.708,Jesus.
01:00:06.875,01:00:09.291,You gotta be fucking kidding me.
01:00:19.500,01:00:21.541,"Sir, are the keys in..."
01:00:21.708,01:00:23.708,You have the keys in it? Sir!
01:00:28.458,01:00:29.833,Shit!
01:00:53.416,01:00:55.000,Charles. Charles!
01:00:56.125,01:00:57.458,Argh!
01:01:27.958,01:01:28.958,AUTOMATED VOICE: Going up.
01:03:46.875,01:03:48.041,"Oh, shit!"
01:03:48.208,01:03:49.416,You all right?
01:03:51.500,01:03:52.666,We gotta get outta here.
01:03:56.083,01:03:57.583,CHARLES: I'm so sorry.
01:03:59.250,01:04:00.625,I'm so sorry.
01:04:26.250,01:04:30.625,NEWSCASTER: Emergency personnel are still on scene at Harrah's Casino Hotel in Oklahoma City...
01:04:30.791,01:04:34.625,where at least 400 guests were stricken with temporary paralysis yesterday.
01:04:34.958,01:04:38.416,Many are noting a similarity to the Westchester incident over a year ago...
01:04:38.583,01:04:40.250,that left over 600 injured...
01:04:40.416,01:04:43.166,"and took the lives of seven mutants, including several of the X-Men."
01:04:43.916,01:04:45.041,Knock it off.
01:04:47.916,01:04:49.416,"I said, knock it off!"
01:04:49.583,01:04:51.166,"She's a child, Logan."
01:04:53.666,01:04:55.166,"And, point of fact, she's your..."
01:04:55.333,01:04:56.750,How long has it been since you took your meds?
01:04:59.250,01:05:00.291,"Tell me, how long has it been?"
01:05:00.416,01:05:01.750,I don't know!
01:05:02.416,01:05:03.750,Two days.
01:05:03.875,01:05:05.416,You saw what happened yesterday.
01:05:05.500,01:05:07.708,"If that shit had gone on any longer, everyone in that casino..."
01:05:07.791,01:05:10.041,I did what I had to do to save Laura.
01:05:10.208,01:05:11.500,You didn't do anything.
01:05:11.666,01:05:14.083,You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure!
01:05:14.750,01:05:20.125,"I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic."
01:05:20.291,01:05:21.791,So much easier for you.
01:05:21.958,01:05:23.041,Easier? Jesus!
01:05:23.208,01:05:25.416,"There is nothing easy about you, Charles, nothing!"
01:05:25.583,01:05:28.041,"Yes, yes, please be like the rest of the world..."
01:05:28.208,01:05:30.708,blaming someone else for your boring shit.
01:05:30.875,01:05:32.625,"I know, Pop, I'm such a giant disappointment."
01:05:32.875,01:05:36.708,You honestly derive no sense of purpose...
01:05:36.875,01:05:37.916,from what we're doing?
01:05:38.083,01:05:39.625,"Okay, what are we doing?"
01:05:40.375,01:05:43.958,There is a young mutant sitting in our car.
01:05:44.125,01:05:45.166,"Yeah, I see that."
01:05:45.333,01:05:47.500,"And where we're taking her, there are others."
01:05:47.666,01:05:49.458,Does that mean nothing to you?
01:05:49.625,01:05:51.458,"Yeah, means nothing to me."
01:05:51.833,01:05:53.208,Especially since Nurse Gabriela...
01:05:53.375,01:05:55.791,made all that Eden shit up with fucking comic books.
01:05:55.958,01:05:57.625,What are you talking about?
01:05:57.791,01:05:58.833,"Give those to him, will you?"
01:05:58.958,01:06:00.125,Take out two pills and give them to him.
01:06:00.250,01:06:01.750,Logan! Logan!
01:06:01.958,01:06:03.083,Now!
01:06:08.000,01:06:09.041,I wanna see it.
01:06:32.833,01:06:35.000,PIERCE: Dr. Rice.
01:07:02.166,01:07:04.625,Motherfucking auto-trucks.
01:07:04.875,01:07:06.125,"Language, Logan."
01:07:06.291,01:07:08.416,And you're screaming at a machine.
01:07:08.583,01:07:11.750,"Oh, what? She can gut a man with her feet, she can't hear a few naughty words, huh?"
01:07:11.916,01:07:14.500,CHARLES: She can learn to be better.
01:07:14.666,01:07:16.125,"You mean, better than me?"
01:07:16.291,01:07:18.000,"Actually, yes."
01:07:19.750,01:07:21.916,"And, by the way, Laura's foot claws..."
01:07:22.083,01:07:24.666,"are the obvious result of her gender, you know."
01:07:24.875,01:07:26.083,LOGAN: Is that a fact?
01:07:26.250,01:07:28.166,"In a pride of lions, the female..."
01:07:28.333,01:07:30.791,is both hunter and caregiver.
01:07:30.958,01:07:32.041,LOGAN: Good to know.
01:07:32.416,01:07:34.916,She uses her front claws for hunting...
01:07:35.083,01:07:36.416,and the back claws defensively.
01:07:36.500,01:07:37.458,"LOGAN: Oh, yeah?"
01:07:37.583,01:07:39.208,"Thus, ensuring their survival."
01:07:45.500,01:07:46.625,"Hey, hey!"
01:08:15.583,01:08:17.125,CHARLES: We should help them.
01:08:18.541,01:08:20.833,"No, we have to keep going."
01:08:21.000,01:08:22.666,Someone has come along.
01:08:34.375,01:08:36.708,FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE: Alert. Alert.
01:08:39.208,01:08:40.750,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:09:19.291,01:09:21.333,"Hey, uh, you need a hand?"
01:09:22.666,01:09:24.625,Ready? Go!
01:09:27.000,01:09:28.500,"Ah. Good, got it."
01:09:30.375,01:09:32.375,"Come on, let's get home."
01:09:32.500,01:09:33.958,Thank you so much for your help.
01:09:34.041,01:09:35.541,I'm Kathryn.
01:09:35.708,01:09:36.708,"This is my son, Nate."
01:09:36.875,01:09:38.083,Hi.
01:09:38.250,01:09:39.666,That's your daughter?
01:09:39.833,01:09:42.000,"Yeah, that's Laura, and that's my dad..."
01:09:42.750,01:09:43.916,Chuck.
01:09:44.041,01:09:45.000,"Come on, Laura, let's go."
01:09:45.083,01:09:48.583,"Well, can we show our appreciation and treat the three of you to a decent meal?"
01:09:48.750,01:09:50.041,We don't live far from here.
01:09:50.208,01:09:52.250,"Uh, no, thanks."
01:10:00.000,01:10:01.916,My name is Dr. Rice.
01:10:02.208,01:10:03.916,But you can call me Zander if you like.
01:10:05.166,01:10:09.041,My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.
01:10:09.375,01:10:13.041,He believes you've been dispensing delayed information...
01:10:13.208,01:10:15.250,to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.
01:10:18.750,01:10:21.250,"I'm offering you the possibility of redemption, Caliban."
01:10:22.375,01:10:25.541,"To protect the world, and in the process, save your friends."
01:10:25.708,01:10:28.958,The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.
01:10:29.125,01:10:30.916,"Unlike you, she's impure."
01:10:31.083,01:10:32.791,She wasn't made by nature.
01:10:32.958,01:10:34.166,She's a mistake of my own.
01:10:34.416,01:10:36.750,I did what I could and they burned me and beat me.
01:10:36.916,01:10:38.583,Your colleagues are savages.
01:10:40.583,01:10:42.458,The Reavers were very ineffective.
01:10:42.625,01:10:45.541,But I'm bringing new tools to bear.
01:10:45.708,01:10:47.791,But I still need someone to point us in the right direction.
01:10:47.958,01:10:49.208,"No, I can't help you."
01:10:49.375,01:10:51.041,"Breathe, breathe."
01:10:51.208,01:10:53.208,"Now, what does he have?"
01:10:53.416,01:10:55.125,Alzheimer's? ALS?
01:10:56.166,01:11:00.416,A degenerative brain disease in the world's most dangerous brain?
01:11:01.250,01:11:02.333,What a combo.
01:11:05.166,01:11:07.291,KATHRYN: Be nice.
01:11:07.458,01:11:08.500,CHARLES: That's wonderful.
01:11:08.666,01:11:09.833,"KATHRYN: Everybody, have a seat."
01:11:10.000,01:11:11.291,"WILL: Nate, sit up."
01:11:11.458,01:11:12.958,"James, why don't you sit at the end of the table?"
01:11:13.125,01:11:15.166,KATHRYN: You wanna say grace?
01:11:16.125,01:11:18.791,"Uh, thank you, God, for this food..."
01:11:19.458,01:11:21.958,"and for our new friends, the Howletts."
01:11:22.125,01:11:23.416,Mmm. They came to our aid.
01:11:23.583,01:11:24.958,Amen.
01:11:25.333,01:11:26.500,WILL: Here we go.
01:11:26.666,01:11:28.458,"Thank you, sir."
01:11:43.333,01:11:44.333,LOGAN: Mmm-hmm.
01:11:46.875,01:11:48.458,"Oh, there's plenty more if she wants."
01:11:48.625,01:11:50.166,She's fine. Thank you.
01:11:50.333,01:11:51.333,CHARLES: This is delicious.
01:11:51.500,01:11:52.791,"KATHRYN: Oh, thank you."
01:11:52.958,01:11:54.333,Where are you all headed?
01:11:54.500,01:11:55.875,Uh... Oregon.
01:11:57.708,01:11:58.750,Um...
01:11:58.875,01:12:01.208,"Well, Oregon and then South Dakota."
01:12:01.333,01:12:02.666,Vacation?
01:12:02.833,01:12:03.833,Uh... Yes.
01:12:04.291,01:12:06.000,"Uh, long overdue."
01:12:06.166,01:12:07.458,We're city folk.
01:12:07.625,01:12:11.041,"Always wanted to take a road trip, see the country."
01:12:12.333,01:12:13.666,Um... And meet the people in it.
01:12:13.833,01:12:15.125,KATHRYN: That sounds lovely.
01:12:15.333,01:12:18.041,Been trying to get Will here to take a vacation for years now.
01:12:18.208,01:12:20.875,"Oh. If we go traipsing all over the country, who's gonna take care of this place?"
01:12:21.041,01:12:22.875,KATHRYN: Exactly.
01:12:23.041,01:12:24.083,And live off what?
01:12:24.250,01:12:26.000,The Lord will provide.
01:12:26.166,01:12:29.208,WILL: I'm still waiting for the Lord to provide me with a new thresher.
01:12:29.416,01:12:31.083,"KATHRYN: All the same, I'd love to travel someday."
01:12:31.583,01:12:33.708,And I bet you will.
01:12:34.333,01:12:35.291,I could drop out of school.
01:12:35.375,01:12:36.375,"Okay, let's not go that far."
01:12:36.500,01:12:37.583,"I mean, I'll do it."
01:12:37.750,01:12:38.916,KATHRYN: No. No.
01:12:39.125,01:12:40.416,"You wanna travel, I wanna travel."
01:12:40.541,01:12:41.541,KATHRYN: Son. Son.
01:12:41.916,01:12:42.958,"WILL: That sounds good to you, right?"
01:12:43.125,01:12:44.375,This is the perfect plan.
01:12:44.541,01:12:45.708,"Why would you want to do that, Nate?"
01:12:46.666,01:12:49.083,"Careful, you're speaking to a man who ran a school..."
01:12:50.666,01:12:52.041,for a lot of years.
01:12:52.708,01:12:54.583,"Yes, it was a..."
01:12:55.208,01:12:58.375,It was a special needs school. Um...
01:12:59.583,01:13:01.125,Uh-huh.
01:13:01.875,01:13:03.291,"He was there, too."
01:13:03.458,01:13:04.458,"Oh, yeah, no. Um..."
01:13:04.583,01:13:05.625,I got kicked out a few times.
01:13:06.916,01:13:09.916,"I wish I could say you were a good pupil, but the words would choke me."
01:13:32.541,01:13:34.500,"Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for this."
01:13:34.583,01:13:35.958,"Uh, it was great."
01:13:36.125,01:13:37.916,"But we have a long drive ahead of us, so..."
01:13:38.083,01:13:39.083,"But you need to rest, don't you?"
01:13:39.416,01:13:40.916,"LOGAN: Yeah, we'll find a motel somewhere."
01:13:41.083,01:13:43.166,The nearest one is two hours from here and it's not even that nice.
01:13:43.666,01:13:48.333,We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter and you can sleep in the living room on the convertible.
01:13:48.500,01:13:51.000,"Kathryn, it's very, very nice of you, but we really should go."
01:13:51.125,01:13:53.291,We can leave early in the morning.
01:13:53.458,01:13:56.750,"Break of dawn, as it were."
01:13:59.458,01:14:01.416,"Okay, why don't we wash up, Pop?"
01:14:01.583,01:14:02.583,Okay.
01:14:02.666,01:14:03.708,Sit.
01:14:07.000,01:14:09.625,"KATHRYN: Um, sweetie, you want some dessert?"
01:14:09.791,01:14:13.083,"Two days on the road, only one meal, and hardly any sleep."
01:14:13.250,01:14:15.291,"She's 11, I'm fucking 90."
01:14:15.458,01:14:17.291,"Well, that's 101 reasons to keep moving."
01:14:17.458,01:14:19.458,"I'm not a box of avocados, Logan."
01:14:19.625,01:14:21.250,LOGAN: And then what?
01:14:21.458,01:14:24.958,Then we take her to her friends in Eden.
01:14:27.208,01:14:29.500,And then we buy the Sunseeker.
01:14:31.125,01:14:32.458,Take the pills.
01:14:36.875,01:14:37.875,"WILL: Oh, shit!"
01:14:39.541,01:14:41.000,What's going on?
01:14:41.166,01:14:43.166,Go fill up the tub before we lose pressure.
01:14:43.333,01:14:44.708,"Honey, check the sink."
01:14:44.875,01:14:46.333,KATHRYN: They shut it off again.
01:14:47.000,01:14:48.458,They are just not going to let this thing go.
01:14:48.625,01:14:50.000,"Well, you might as well handle it now."
01:14:50.166,01:14:51.958,It can wait till the morning.
01:14:52.125,01:14:54.500,KATHRYN: We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes.
01:14:54.666,01:14:56.333,"All right, all right."
01:14:57.208,01:14:59.708,The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here.
01:15:00.166,01:15:01.833,Sometimes it gets itself shut off.
01:15:02.041,01:15:03.041,By assholes.
01:15:03.208,01:15:04.208,No.
01:15:04.541,01:15:06.500,My son is happy to go with you.
01:15:06.666,01:15:08.416,"No, no, no, that's fine."
01:15:08.583,01:15:10.375,"The men that do this, sometimes they can be..."
01:15:10.541,01:15:12.333,I can go.
01:15:12.500,01:15:14.000,"All right, I'll go."
01:15:14.166,01:15:15.875,"Just, uh, let me get my dad settled."
01:15:22.375,01:15:24.708,"WILL: I'm just saying, I don't care what the lawyer says."
01:15:27.083,01:15:28.083,KATHRYN: But it's dangerous.
01:15:28.916,01:15:30.416,WILL: I'm not gonna hurt our chances.
01:15:44.458,01:15:45.625,Want TV? There's TV here.
01:15:45.791,01:15:46.791,I'm fine.
01:15:46.916,01:15:48.041,Okay. Get some rest.
01:15:48.125,01:15:50.125,"You know, Logan..."
01:15:50.708,01:15:52.875,this is what life looks like.
01:15:53.250,01:15:55.916,"A home, people who love each other."
01:15:56.083,01:15:57.250,Safe place.
01:15:57.416,01:15:59.916,You should take a moment and feel it.
01:16:02.791,01:16:04.750,Yeah. It's great.
01:16:04.916,01:16:06.416,Logan. Logan!
01:16:08.458,01:16:10.583,You still have time.
01:16:13.083,01:16:17.208,"Charles, the world is not the same as it was."
01:16:19.583,01:16:22.291,"We're taking a risk hanging around here, you know that."
01:16:22.875,01:16:25.541,"And where we're going, Eden..."
01:16:26.458,01:16:27.833,it doesn't exist.
01:16:28.750,01:16:30.916,Her nurse got it from a comic book.
01:16:32.791,01:16:35.166,You understand?
01:16:35.833,01:16:37.916,It is for Laura.
01:16:41.750,01:16:44.125,It is for Laura.
01:16:47.125,01:16:48.458,Get some rest.
01:16:52.000,01:16:55.125,"Canewood Beverage bought up everything out here, except for us."
01:16:55.291,01:16:57.958,"When we wouldn't sell, they tried eminent domain..."
01:16:58.125,01:16:59.750,then screwing with our water.
01:17:00.750,01:17:03.250,"Couple of months ago, somebody poisoned our dogs."
01:17:03.833,01:17:06.500,"LOGAN: So, out on the highway today, those trucks..."
01:17:07.500,01:17:09.166,Who knows. Maybe.
01:17:10.375,01:17:12.375,"Hey, look at 'em."
01:17:12.958,01:17:16.166,Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton bodies and tiny little brains...
01:17:16.333,01:17:18.500,shucking their cloned-up super corn.
01:17:18.666,01:17:19.958,"You know it tastes like shit, too."
01:17:20.125,01:17:21.333,Why do people eat it?
01:17:21.500,01:17:23.875,They don't.
01:17:24.041,01:17:25.791,It's in those drinks that everyone's having...
01:17:25.958,01:17:29.541,"to stay awake, cheer up, feel strong, sexy, whatever."
01:17:29.708,01:17:32.583,Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day.
01:17:32.750,01:17:34.166,LOGAN: Mine still are.
01:17:56.041,01:17:58.833,Those are for breakaway roping.
01:17:59.916,01:18:01.666,Those are for barrel racing...
01:18:01.916,01:18:03.875,and right here is for pole bending.
01:18:04.041,01:18:05.875,"They're all second, third place."
01:18:06.041,01:18:09.708,"I'm not too good at it, but my dad makes me."
01:18:18.375,01:18:20.375,Do you want to listen?
01:18:30.708,01:18:31.750,Do you like it?
01:18:35.750,01:18:38.083,"Um, here, you can take it for tonight..."
01:18:38.250,01:18:41.291,and I'll get it back from you in the morning.
01:18:54.125,01:18:56.250,Looks like we're gonna be here a while.
01:19:29.625,01:19:30.958,Should hold it.
01:19:31.125,01:19:32.250,Yeah.
01:19:32.500,01:19:34.083,Till next time.
01:19:37.791,01:19:41.791,"Hey, so, uh, how long has your girl been like that?"
01:19:42.166,01:19:43.333,Mute.
01:19:44.166,01:19:47.458,"Uh, since the beginning."
01:19:48.000,01:19:49.000,Mmm.
01:19:49.583,01:19:51.625,"Well, in a lot of ways, I envy you."
01:19:52.750,01:19:55.625,"They get to be Nate's age, with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths..."
01:19:56.958,01:19:59.291,Makes you wonder the whole point of it all.
01:20:01.666,01:20:03.166,Shit.
01:20:07.333,01:20:08.333,Don't worry.
01:20:08.500,01:20:10.000,We won't need it.
01:20:10.458,01:20:11.458,Stay here.
01:20:18.916,01:20:20.208,"Evening, Mr. Munson."
01:20:20.708,01:20:21.708,What brings y'all this way?
01:20:22.833,01:20:24.291,Why don't you ask your boys?
01:20:24.458,01:20:27.291,"Mr. Munson, you understand you're trespassing right now, right?"
01:20:27.458,01:20:30.000,I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.
01:20:30.125,01:20:31.458,Huh. Bullshit.
01:20:31.625,01:20:33.625,Previous being the operative word.
01:20:34.833,01:20:36.041,Who's this?
01:20:37.416,01:20:39.875,Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
01:20:40.041,01:20:42.708,Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.
01:20:47.208,01:20:48.250,"Hey, Carl..."
01:20:49.000,01:20:52.166,it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.
01:20:52.333,01:20:53.666,Looks that way.
01:20:53.833,01:20:55.250,He's a friend of mine.
01:20:55.416,01:20:57.041,A friend with a big mouth.
01:20:57.375,01:20:58.666,I hear that a lot.
01:20:58.833,01:21:00.375,"JACKSON: Then you probably hear this, too."
01:21:03.083,01:21:04.625,More than I'd like.
01:21:04.791,01:21:05.916,Then you know the drill.
01:21:07.083,01:21:08.916,I'mma count to three...
01:21:09.083,01:21:10.375,and you're gonna start walking away.
01:21:10.541,01:21:11.541,I got rights to this water.
01:21:11.666,01:21:12.791,One.
01:21:12.875,01:21:13.875,Two.
01:21:15.583,01:21:17.000,Three.
01:21:17.208,01:21:18.500,"You all right, boss?"
01:21:21.250,01:21:23.000,You know the drill.
01:21:23.083,01:21:24.083,Get the hell out of here.
01:21:24.250,01:21:26.083,"You okay, boss?"
01:21:26.208,01:21:27.208,Go!
01:21:44.291,01:21:45.750,You've had training.
01:21:46.208,01:21:47.250,Some.
01:22:06.958,01:22:09.125,"CHARLES: Hey, don't wake her yet."
01:22:09.500,01:22:11.916,Let her sleep another hour.
01:22:16.250,01:22:17.958,"You know, Logan..."
01:22:19.666,01:22:22.625,"this was, without a doubt..."
01:22:23.833,01:22:28.791,the most perfect night I've had in a very long time.
01:22:36.791,01:22:38.791,But I don't deserve it.
01:22:40.750,01:22:41.958,Do I?
01:22:45.458,01:22:47.791,I did something.
01:22:50.458,01:22:52.833,Something unspeakable.
01:22:58.791,01:23:02.333,I've remembered what happened in Westchester.
01:23:07.041,01:23:10.333,This is not the first time I've hurt people.
01:23:12.333,01:23:15.625,"Until today, I didn't know."
01:23:16.541,01:23:18.541,You wouldn't tell me.
01:23:20.708,01:23:26.708,So we just kept on running away from it.
01:23:31.166,01:23:34.875,I think I finally understand you.
01:23:38.208,01:23:39.541,Logan...
01:24:07.291,01:24:08.625,He's fantastic.
01:24:08.791,01:24:10.083,You said you only needed the girl!
01:24:10.250,01:24:12.416,I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.
01:24:12.583,01:24:13.750,Your friends had every chance.
01:24:13.916,01:24:15.125,And so did you.
01:24:16.250,01:24:17.375,KATHRYN: Nate?
01:24:21.125,01:24:22.458,Put her down.
01:24:30.958,01:24:31.958,Honey.
01:24:32.500,01:24:34.083,"KATHRYN: Stay down there, Will!"
01:24:36.416,01:24:37.375,Stop!
01:24:38.583,01:24:39.583,WILL: Kathryn!
01:24:40.375,01:24:41.541,WILL: Kathryn!
01:24:41.625,01:24:42.916,Kathryn!
01:25:11.500,01:25:12.541,Charles!
01:25:13.625,01:25:14.791,Charles!
01:25:28.125,01:25:29.125,Hold this.
01:25:29.291,01:25:31.416,It wasn't me.
01:25:34.041,01:25:35.041,DR. RICE: Here he comes.
01:25:35.958,01:25:38.166,"DRIVER: I could pick him up, meet him halfway."
01:25:38.333,01:25:39.833,"No, no, no."
01:25:40.000,01:25:42.125,We struggled with the X-23s.
01:25:42.291,01:25:43.333,"We assumed, because they were children..."
01:25:43.500,01:25:44.833,we could raise them without a conscience.
01:25:45.000,01:25:46.875,But you can't nurture rage.
01:25:47.041,01:25:48.208,You must simply design it...
01:25:48.375,01:25:49.375,from scratch.
01:25:57.000,01:25:59.375,Who the fuck is that?
01:26:04.291,01:26:05.541,Will Munson!
01:26:08.708,01:26:10.125,"Just hold on, Charles."
01:26:10.750,01:26:12.916,"JACKSON: Munson, God damn it, come out here!"
01:26:17.208,01:26:18.208,JACKSON: Munson!
01:26:20.000,01:26:21.416,Come out here now!
01:26:22.208,01:26:23.708,"Come out here now, Munson."
01:26:23.875,01:26:25.208,There's that asshole.
01:26:27.208,01:26:28.541,"Hello, asshole."
01:26:28.708,01:26:31.583,"Listen, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones."
01:26:31.875,01:26:33.750,I don't know what Munson's paying you...
01:26:34.375,01:26:36.958,but Canewood can start you out at five G.
01:26:37.083,01:26:38.125,"A week, that is."
01:26:40.333,01:26:42.333,"You best stay where you are, pal."
01:26:42.500,01:26:44.208,I'm the law out here.
01:26:45.041,01:26:46.833,"No, no, no."
01:26:48.208,01:26:49.208,What in high...
01:26:50.916,01:26:52.833,"What? Oh, shit!"
01:26:53.041,01:26:54.041,Shoot him!
01:26:56.041,01:26:57.083,We need to intervene.
01:26:57.250,01:26:59.500,"Well, he only listens to you, Doctor."
01:27:02.458,01:27:03.583,DR. RICE: 24!
01:27:04.875,01:27:05.875,Get back here!
01:27:06.958,01:27:08.125,Stop! Stop now!
01:27:08.291,01:27:10.125,"Hold this down, right now, tight!"
01:27:14.541,01:27:16.291,Our boat.
01:27:21.625,01:27:23.875,The Sunseeker.
01:27:33.583,01:27:34.583,No.
01:27:43.458,01:27:44.458,Come!
01:27:44.625,01:27:45.791,24!
01:27:46.666,01:27:48.083,Need some help out here!
01:27:48.791,01:27:50.291,I guess we're gonna have to take care of this now.
01:27:50.625,01:27:52.125,DR. RICE: Pierce!
01:27:52.291,01:27:53.583,DR. RICE: Get your lily-faced ass out here!
01:28:00.166,01:28:01.375,DR. RICE: Listen to me!
01:28:01.541,01:28:03.000,What the fuck do you think you're doing?
01:28:03.166,01:28:06.458,"PIERCE: All right, we gotta go around that truck and flank them farmers."
01:28:06.625,01:28:07.916,Follow my lead.
01:28:08.000,01:28:09.875,"Bring extra ammo, take these clips."
01:28:09.958,01:28:11.041,Come!
01:28:11.291,01:28:12.458,Now!
01:28:13.333,01:28:14.666,Pick her up.
01:28:25.500,01:28:26.708,Beware the light.
01:28:49.875,01:28:51.291,What the hell are you?
01:31:18.291,01:31:19.541,Sit down.
01:31:38.833,01:31:40.125,Hold still.
01:31:40.500,01:31:41.833,Hold still.
01:32:03.916,01:32:04.916,MAN 1: Get him on the truck.
01:32:05.083,01:32:06.083,MAN 2: Yeah.
01:32:07.791,01:32:09.041,Go.
01:32:14.708,01:32:16.500,"It's all right, it's all right."
01:32:16.666,01:32:19.583,It's all right.
01:32:19.750,01:32:21.708,You're healing.
01:32:23.041,01:32:25.541,"You're a newborn, by any measure."
01:32:25.750,01:32:27.083,Just breathe.
01:32:27.416,01:32:28.500,Your body has work to do.
01:32:28.666,01:32:31.250,"Hemostasis, angiogenesis, epithelialization..."
01:32:31.416,01:32:32.750,stromal cell proliferation.
01:32:34.625,01:32:36.416,This will help you heal.
01:32:37.250,01:32:38.791,Make you stronger.
01:33:33.916,01:33:35.083,LOGAN: Well...
01:33:40.958,01:33:42.833,"It's got water, and..."
01:34:05.875,01:34:07.208,It's got water.
01:34:25.000,01:34:26.333,Fuck this. Fuck this.
01:34:47.291,01:34:49.083,Fuck! Fuck!
01:34:49.208,01:34:50.208,Fuck!
01:34:50.916,01:34:51.916,Shit!
01:35:04.541,01:35:05.708,LOGAN: Fuck! Fuck!
01:35:09.208,01:35:10.875,Motherfucking...
01:35:15.250,01:35:16.250,Shit!
01:35:17.416,01:35:19.500,Fuck! Fuck!
01:35:47.333,01:35:48.916,DOCTOR: Welcome back.
01:35:49.583,01:35:51.333,I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell...
01:35:51.500,01:35:53.333,that nice little girl out in the waiting room...
01:35:53.500,01:35:55.000,her daddy's gone.
01:36:01.166,01:36:02.375,I'd always hoped...
01:36:03.125,01:36:07.625,that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you.
01:36:07.958,01:36:09.625,There's so few of you left.
01:36:12.125,01:36:14.291,"Nice to meet you, too, Doc."
01:36:14.458,01:36:15.666,got to get on my way.
01:36:15.833,01:36:17.083,"No, no, don't do that."
01:36:17.250,01:36:19.666,"What you need is rest, and treatment."
01:36:19.833,01:36:21.250,You need to check yourself in somewhere.
01:36:21.416,01:36:22.583,I'll be fine.
01:36:22.708,01:36:23.791,"No, you're not!"
01:36:24.000,01:36:27.000,"I mean, I know that you're different..."
01:36:27.166,01:36:30.458,but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.
01:36:30.625,01:36:32.833,You got to check yourself into a hospital.
01:36:33.000,01:36:34.666,Find out what it is!
01:36:35.125,01:36:36.291,I know what it is.
01:36:37.250,01:36:40.583,"Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you."
01:36:40.750,01:36:42.000,Maybe I can run some tests.
01:36:42.166,01:36:44.500,"Look, Doc. You seem like a nice guy, all right?"
01:36:44.666,01:36:46.375,"You wanna save a life, save your own."
01:36:46.541,01:36:47.583,Forget we were here.
01:37:00.041,01:37:01.041,Hey!
01:37:01.583,01:37:02.583,Hey!
01:37:23.083,01:37:25.041,"You can't just take shit, you know."
01:37:43.625,01:37:45.833,I don't know how you got me here...
01:37:46.583,01:37:47.708,but thank you.
01:37:47.833,01:37:48.833,De nada.
01:37:49.041,01:37:50.208,Yeah.
01:37:52.041,01:37:53.375,You can talk?
01:37:55.541,01:37:56.791,You can talk?
01:37:57.625,01:37:59.375,What the fuck?
01:37:59.625,01:38:00.750,Why in the fuck...
01:38:00.916,01:38:03.916,"What's all this bullshit been for the last 2,000 fucking miles?"
01:38:06.916,01:38:08.583,What? Shut up.
01:38:08.750,01:38:09.916,Shut the fuck up!
01:38:10.000,01:38:12.708,"Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor."
01:38:12.791,01:38:15.083,What? Who's that?
01:38:15.250,01:38:16.416,Who is that?
01:38:17.791,01:38:21.333,"Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah, and Rictor."
01:38:21.833,01:38:22.916,North Dakota.
01:38:23.875,01:38:25.166,What?
01:38:25.291,01:38:26.666,"North Dakota, por favor."
01:38:26.791,01:38:27.916,"Shit, okay. Look..."
01:38:28.000,01:38:29.166,No. Por favor.
01:38:30.750,01:38:32.458,This place. Okay?
01:38:32.625,01:38:36.083,"Your nurse, she read too many stories, you understand?"
01:38:36.250,01:38:37.833,Too many stories!
01:38:41.708,01:38:44.458,I've seen it!
01:38:44.625,01:38:45.791,This all here...
01:38:45.958,01:38:47.958,None of this...
01:38:48.041,01:38:49.041,You understand me?
01:38:49.208,01:38:50.500,This Eden does not exist. No!
01:38:50.625,01:38:51.958,Si! Eden!
01:38:52.125,01:38:53.958,"It's a fantasy, kid."
01:38:54.125,01:38:56.958,Those are the names of the people who just made this...
01:38:57.041,01:38:58.833,They made this whole thing up.
01:38:59.291,01:39:00.625,Okay? This whole...
01:39:00.791,01:39:03.625,"It happened once, and they just turned it into a big, fucking lie!"
01:39:05.083,01:39:06.166,That's all this is. No!
01:39:06.916,01:39:08.000,Fuck.
01:39:10.458,01:39:12.291,"I know, I understand."
01:39:12.708,01:39:14.625,This is a long way.
01:39:14.791,01:39:15.750,You understand?
01:39:15.833,01:39:18.208,I am not taking you to North Dakota.
01:39:21.375,01:39:24.625,I am fucked up.
01:39:24.833,01:39:28.000,It is a two-day drive.
01:39:28.166,01:39:30.875,Don't fucking hit me!
01:39:31.041,01:39:32.041,Don't hit me!
01:39:32.833,01:39:34.041,"Jonah, Gideon..."
01:39:34.166,01:39:35.208,Stop saying those names.
01:39:35.333,01:39:36.333,"Delilah, Rictor."
01:39:36.416,01:39:37.916,Right now.
01:39:38.000,01:39:39.166,Stop it! Stop!
01:39:39.333,01:39:40.500,"Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca..."
01:39:40.666,01:39:43.041,"Fuck it. Fine, fine."
01:39:43.500,01:39:45.166,You wanna go?
01:39:45.250,01:39:47.125,I'll take you there.
01:39:47.541,01:39:49.083,See for yourself.
01:39:49.375,01:39:51.666,Let's go to fucking fantasyland.
01:40:04.541,01:40:06.958,"MAJOR: We understand the importance of containment, Dr. Rice."
01:40:07.208,01:40:09.416,But you can't leave a war zone behind like you did in Juarez.
01:40:09.583,01:40:12.041,"Well, try to remind yourselves that these are all little killing machines."
01:40:12.208,01:40:14.166,Machines who would've happily disemboweled your family.
01:40:14.250,01:40:15.250,Not all.
01:40:16.375,01:40:19.458,"I was told you want these assets off-board, dead or alive."
01:40:19.625,01:40:20.875,Are you changing my brief?
01:40:21.041,01:40:22.041,No.
01:40:22.291,01:40:23.541,"All right, then."
01:40:25.416,01:40:26.541,Save tissue from this one.
01:40:26.708,01:40:28.833,He's a good tracker and had a high IQ.
01:40:34.208,01:40:35.541,Here you go.
01:41:12.375,01:41:13.375,Hey.
01:41:21.125,01:41:22.125,Hmm?
01:41:22.333,01:41:23.583,Let me drive.
01:41:26.250,01:41:27.583,Absolutely not.
01:41:33.291,01:41:34.833,Quit looking at me.
01:41:39.250,01:41:40.500,No comprende.
01:41:46.375,01:41:47.833,You want to die.
01:41:50.708,01:41:52.250,Charles told me.
01:41:55.333,01:41:57.541,What else did he tell you?
01:41:57.958,01:41:59.541,To not let you.
01:42:11.708,01:42:13.541,"Hey, hey, hey!"
01:42:20.750,01:42:21.750,Rest.
01:45:06.333,01:45:07.833,RICTOR: Keep it steady.
01:45:10.166,01:45:11.750,RICTOR: Swing him toward me.
01:45:14.250,01:45:15.250,Yeah.
01:45:17.833,01:45:54.958,"Easy. Easy Is this good, Rictor?"
01:45:55.416,01:45:56.625,"No, not so much. Less."
01:46:02.958,01:46:04.416,Hey!
01:46:10.916,01:46:12.208,Where am I?
01:46:14.041,01:46:15.750,"Hey, what is it?"
01:46:16.125,01:46:17.416,Where did you get that?
01:46:17.583,01:46:18.916,RICTOR: Where we came from.
01:46:19.541,01:46:21.666,They gave it to us when we would fight.
01:46:21.833,01:46:23.625,"It makes you crazy, is what it does."
01:46:23.750,01:46:24.750,It'll kill you.
01:46:24.833,01:46:26.833,"No, not if you use it in small doses."
01:46:27.500,01:46:28.791,It's helping you heal.
01:46:30.250,01:46:31.583,Where's Laura?
01:46:31.750,01:46:33.750,BOBBY: She's asleep down there.
01:46:33.916,01:46:35.750,Do you want me to wake her up?
01:46:43.458,01:46:44.625,No.
01:47:05.833,01:47:07.541,You had a nightmare.
01:47:11.375,01:47:13.166,Do you have nightmares?
01:47:14.458,01:47:15.458,Si.
01:47:22.333,01:47:23.833,Mine are different.
01:47:49.333,01:47:50.833,You know what it is.
01:47:52.666,01:47:54.583,It's made out of Adamantium.
01:47:55.375,01:47:57.583,It's what they put inside of us.
01:47:58.500,01:48:00.333,That's why it can kill us.
01:48:02.166,01:48:04.500,Probably what is killing me now.
01:48:06.583,01:48:07.875,Anyway...
01:48:08.458,01:48:10.208,I got this a long time ago...
01:48:11.583,01:48:15.000,and I kept it as a reminder of what I am.
01:48:17.250,01:48:19.166,"Now I keep it to, uh..."
01:48:26.125,01:48:27.416,"Actually, uh..."
01:48:30.875,01:48:33.125,I was thinking of shooting myself with it.
01:48:33.750,01:48:35.208,Like Charles said.
01:48:40.958,01:48:42.916,"I've hurt people, too."
01:48:45.916,01:48:48.791,You're gonna have to learn how to live with that.
01:48:58.291,01:49:00.291,They were bad people.
01:49:04.083,01:49:05.750,All the same.
01:50:20.791,01:50:23.041,Not funny.
01:50:24.625,01:50:26.000,"Hey! Hey, pal."
01:50:26.166,01:50:28.500,How long have I been out?
01:50:30.125,01:50:31.291,How long have I been in that bed?
01:50:31.500,01:50:32.833,Two days.
01:50:33.000,01:50:34.166,You've been sitting here for two days?
01:50:34.333,01:50:35.750,"Hey, go inside and tell everyone to get packing."
01:50:35.916,01:50:37.500,You can't do that.
01:50:37.666,01:50:39.541,We had to wait.
01:50:39.708,01:50:42.000,And everyone had till today to find their way here.
01:50:42.166,01:50:44.750,"If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you and they will kill you all."
01:50:44.833,01:50:45.875,You need to get out!
01:50:46.000,01:50:48.083,We're leaving tomorrow before dawn.
01:50:48.500,01:50:50.083,We're gonna cross the border.
01:50:50.250,01:50:51.833,It's a safe haven.
01:50:53.125,01:50:54.375,Same coordinates?
01:50:54.541,01:50:56.708,"Yes, between noon and 5:00."
01:50:56.875,01:50:59.250,Satellites are blind then.
01:50:59.416,01:51:00.458,Your asylum approved.
01:51:00.583,01:51:01.666,Copy.
01:51:17.750,01:51:19.416,"RICTOR: Swing it to your right, Laura."
01:51:22.875,01:51:24.708,A little more. Yeah.
01:51:24.875,01:51:26.250,You see the woods?
01:51:28.375,01:51:29.458,Si.
01:51:30.041,01:51:31.458,It's an eight mile hike through there.
01:51:32.625,01:51:33.750,And you see that pass?
01:51:33.916,01:51:35.083,LAURA: Mm-hmm.
01:51:35.250,01:51:36.416,RICTOR: That's the border.
01:51:38.291,01:51:40.125,That's where we will be safe.
01:51:47.375,01:51:48.916,Come inside.
01:51:55.791,01:51:57.333,Laura told me all that you did for her.
01:51:57.791,01:51:59.833,She was lucky to have you.
01:52:02.291,01:52:04.250,Take it.
01:52:06.083,01:52:08.666,"That's why you did it, right?"
01:52:10.916,01:52:12.666,"Yeah, well..."
01:52:13.458,01:52:16.291,"Look, I don't need it."
01:52:16.625,01:52:18.333,Suit yourself.
01:52:39.958,01:52:41.625,"Your friends, they seem nice."
01:52:41.791,01:52:42.791,Kind of reminds me...
01:52:44.500,01:52:45.958,"Hey, hey, what's going on?"
01:52:46.458,01:52:47.458,Huh?
01:52:49.000,01:52:50.375,You're with your pals.
01:52:51.375,01:52:52.875,Where will you go?
01:52:53.958,01:52:55.458,"Nearest bar, for starters."
01:52:56.833,01:52:59.333,"Hey, I got you here."
01:52:59.500,01:53:01.333,I even gave back the money.
01:53:01.500,01:53:02.583,Such a nice man.
01:53:02.666,01:53:04.833,"Hey, I never asked for this!"
01:53:05.541,01:53:07.291,All right?
01:53:07.458,01:53:09.375,Caliban never asked for this.
01:53:10.166,01:53:12.208,And they are six feet under the ground!
01:53:13.333,01:53:15.291,"Now, I don't know what Charles put in your head..."
01:53:15.458,01:53:18.291,"but I am not whatever it is you think I am, okay?"
01:53:19.708,01:53:22.000,"I only met you, like, a week ago."
01:53:23.166,01:53:25.166,"You got your Rebecca, your Delilah..."
01:53:25.333,01:53:27.000,"your blah, blah, blah, whatever."
01:53:27.166,01:53:28.833,"Everything you asked for, you've got it!"
01:53:31.875,01:53:33.750,And it is better this way.
01:53:35.208,01:53:37.166,Because I suck at this.
01:53:38.875,01:53:42.041,Bad shit happens to people I care about.
01:53:42.208,01:53:43.875,You understand me?
01:53:45.958,01:53:47.416,Then I'll be fine.
01:55:55.416,01:55:58.333,RICTOR: Run!
01:57:08.500,01:57:09.791,"GIRL: Run, Bobby, run!"
01:57:14.958,01:57:15.916,Ah!
01:57:33.875,01:57:35.375,DR. RICE: Go! Go!
01:57:36.000,01:57:37.000,Move faster!
01:57:37.166,01:57:39.250,We need to reach them before they get to the border.
01:58:56.083,01:58:57.333,MAN: Move out!
01:58:57.500,01:58:58.500,"Let's go, let's go!"
01:59:00.333,01:59:01.791,RICTOR: Run! Run!
01:59:01.958,01:59:04.541,"Corre, Jonah! Run!"
01:59:11.125,01:59:12.666,I want you to breathe.
01:59:12.833,01:59:14.166,"It's just a flesh wound, baby."
01:59:30.375,01:59:31.375,REAVER: There she is.
01:59:31.583,01:59:32.625,We got her.
01:59:35.375,01:59:37.458,Back it up! Contain her.
02:00:04.041,02:00:05.083,Get behind me!
02:00:26.625,02:00:28.416,You took all the medicine.
02:00:30.000,02:00:31.208,It's wearing off.
02:00:58.000,02:00:59.333,Go to your friends.
02:01:00.583,02:01:01.583,Go.
02:01:03.083,02:01:04.208,Laura?
02:01:06.208,02:01:07.541,You'll know when.
02:01:19.708,02:01:20.958,Nine o'clock.
02:01:23.000,02:01:25.250,"That green juice is wearin' off, huh?"
02:01:26.208,02:01:28.750,"You know, for an old mute, it's kind of a short high."
02:01:29.208,02:01:30.750,"Be hard to keep them claws out, soon."
02:01:30.916,02:01:32.750,"Waste this dick, Logan!"
02:01:34.000,02:01:35.708,"Please stop, Mr. Howlett."
02:01:36.166,02:01:38.333,I'm gonna have to tell these men to fire on these children.
02:01:38.541,02:01:39.875,You don't want that.
02:01:40.041,02:01:42.375,You can see the effects of the serum are wearing off.
02:01:42.541,02:01:45.125,You will not survive further wounds.
02:01:45.375,02:01:46.916,Allow me to introduce myself.
02:01:47.291,02:01:48.291,I'm Zander Rice.
02:01:49.458,02:01:51.541,I believe you knew my father on the Weapon X Program.
02:01:51.708,02:01:55.250,Yeah. He's the asshole who put this poison in me.
02:01:56.291,02:01:57.750,"Yes, he was one of them."
02:01:59.166,02:02:00.958,I think I might have killed him.
02:02:02.291,02:02:03.375,I think you're right.
02:02:03.500,02:02:04.916,"Why don't you show some respect, mutie?"
02:02:05.083,02:02:07.041,You're lookin' at the man who wiped out your kind.

02:02:10.541,02:02:13.250,He makes it sound more brutal than intended.
02:02:13.416,02:02:16.666,The goal was not to end mutant kind...
02:02:16.833,02:02:18.125,but to control it.
02:02:20.291,02:02:23.000,I realized we needn't stop perfecting what we eat and drink.
02:02:23.166,02:02:25.291,That we could use those products to perfect ourselves.
02:02:26.416,02:02:29.125,To distribute gene therapy discreetly through everything...
02:02:29.291,02:02:31.500,from sweet drinks to breakfast cereals.
02:02:31.666,02:02:32.791,And it worked.
02:02:32.958,02:02:35.458,Random mutancy went the way of polio.
02:02:35.625,02:02:36.916,We embarked on our next endeavor.
