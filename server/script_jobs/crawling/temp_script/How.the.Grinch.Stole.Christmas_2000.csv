00:01:10.070,00:01:14.241,there happened a story you must see to believe.
00:01:30.549,00:01:39.892,"Way up in the mountains, in the high range of Pontoos, lay the small town of Whoville, the home of the Whos."
00:01:44.187,00:01:52.153,Ask any Who and they'll have this to say: There is no place like Whoville around Christmas Day.
00:01:52.153,00:01:59.661,"Every window was flocked, every lamppost was dressed, and the Whoville band marched in their Christmasy best."
00:02:04.625,00:02:07.419,Merry Christmas.
00:02:20.099,00:02:26.730,"Arbor Day was fine and Easter was pleasant, and every St. Fizzin's Day they ate a Fizz pheasant."
00:02:26.730,00:02:35.280,But every Who knew from their 12 toes to their snout they loved Christmas the most without a single Who doubt.
00:02:39.827,00:02:41.787,Farfingle's welcomes you.
00:02:41.787,00:02:43.122,Merry Christmas.
00:02:44.205,00:02:45.791,Thank you for shopping Farfingle's.
00:02:45.791,00:02:51.296,"We got a snoozle phone for your brother, Drew, and a snoozle phone, for your brother, Stu."
00:02:51.296,00:02:53.548,"A muncle, for your uncle."
00:02:53.548,00:02:57.344,"A fant for your aunt, a fandpa for your cousin, Leon."
00:02:57.344,00:03:01.222,So we just need-- Cindy?
00:03:01.222,00:03:02.683,Cindy Lou?
00:03:02.683,00:03:05.268,- Hello.
00:03:05.268,00:03:07.395,Excuse me.
00:03:08.856,00:03:10.189,- Dad?
00:03:10.189,00:03:12.359,Doesn't this seem like a bit much?
00:03:12.359,00:03:14.903,This is what Christmas is all about.
00:03:14.903,00:03:16.655,Can't you feel it?
00:03:16.655,00:03:19.449,"Merry Christmas, thank you for coming."
00:03:19.449,00:03:21.702,"Wait a second, don't forget your change."
00:03:21.702,00:03:23.244,Another minute closer to Christmas...
00:03:25.747,00:03:30.878,"...and for the next five minutes only, 99% off."
00:03:42.597,00:03:47.728,"Yes, every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot."
00:03:47.728,00:03:54.234,"But the Grinch, who lived just north of Whoville, did not."
00:03:56.111,00:03:59.489,"Hey, girls, all the good mistletoe is at the top."
00:03:59.489,00:04:01.867,"Hey, Drew, I'll race you!"
00:04:01.867,00:04:04.661,- Not if I race you first.
00:04:01.867,00:04:07.372,"- Last one to the top is a stinky, old Grinch."
00:04:07.372,00:04:10.333,"- You guys, where are we?"
00:04:10.333,00:04:11.793,I think we should go back.
00:04:11.793,00:04:15.089,What? You're scared of the Grinch.
00:04:15.089,00:04:16.631,No.
00:04:16.631,00:04:22.303,"They say he lives up here in a big cave, and he comes down when he's hungry for the taste of..."
00:04:22.303,00:04:24.056,- Who flesh!
00:04:24.056,00:04:25.224,You guys!
00:04:25.224,00:04:27.226,You're scared of the Grinch!
00:04:27.226,00:04:29.269,You're scared of the Grinch.
00:04:35.901,00:04:37.527,Wait for me.
00:04:47.537,00:04:49.414,"Oh, come on, touch it."
00:04:49.414,00:04:50.624,Touch the door.
00:04:50.624,00:04:52.793,"Do it for me, Stu."
00:05:24.866,00:05:27.119,"Well done, Max."
00:05:27.119,00:05:33.667,"Serves them right, those yuletide-loving, sickly sweet, nog-sucking cheermongers."
00:05:34.668,00:05:37.336,I really don't like them.
00:05:37.336,00:05:40.048,Uh-uh.
00:05:43.010,00:05:44.303,Max!
00:05:45.762,00:05:48.890,Get my cloak.
00:05:48.890,00:05:56.106,"I've been much too tolerant of these Whovenile delinquents and their innocent, victimless pranks."
00:05:56.106,00:05:59.818,"So they want to get to know me, do they?"
00:05:59.818,00:06:03.362,They want to spend a little quality time with the Grinch.
00:06:04.489,00:06:07.242,I guess I could use a little...
00:06:07.242,00:06:09.410,social interaction.
00:06:18.503,00:06:19.796,Merry Christmas!
00:06:19.796,00:06:23.884,"Oh, yeah, you bet."
00:06:26.511,00:06:30.515,"Oh my, someone has vandalized that vehicle."
00:06:30.515,00:06:33.601,"You see, Max, the city is a dangerous place."
00:06:33.601,00:06:36.313,"The Grinch hated Christmas, the whole Christmas season."
00:06:36.313,00:06:37.689,- Top of the day.
00:06:37.689,00:06:39.398,"Now, please, don't ask why."
00:06:39.398,00:06:41.151,No one quite knows the reason.
00:06:41.151,00:06:42.652,"Hey, kids, here's a present for you."
00:06:42.652,00:06:44.112,Be sure to run real fast with it now.
00:06:44.112,00:06:45.822,"Come on, double time, Let's go! Move!"
00:06:45.822,00:06:49.326,It could be that his head wasn't screwed on just right.
00:06:49.326,00:06:52.411,"It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight."
00:06:52.411,00:06:59.753,But I think that the most likely reason of all may have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
00:06:59.753,00:07:03.173,"Hey, stranger, I won't let you go until you buy a chapeau."
00:07:15.060,00:07:17.604,"Boy, nothing beats Christmas, right?"
00:07:17.604,00:07:19.522,I guess.
00:07:19.522,00:07:21.566,You guess?
00:07:21.566,00:07:26.905,It's just-- look around at you and Mom and everyone getting all kerbobbled.
00:07:26.905,00:07:28.407,Doesn't this seem...
00:07:28.407,00:07:29.783,superfluous?
00:07:29.783,00:07:31.410,Drew Who: Dad!
00:07:31.410,00:07:34.413,Dad!
00:07:35.705,00:07:37.249,What happened to you?
00:07:37.249,00:07:38.792,It was the Grinch!
00:07:43.922,00:07:45.173,Whos: The Grinch?!
00:07:45.173,00:07:46.674,What do you want?
00:07:45.173,00:07:48.676,"I mean-- Grinch? Oh, no!"
00:07:49.928,00:07:52.806,"Did someone just say, Grinch?"
00:07:52.806,00:07:55.600,"Hello, Mayor May Who, sir."
00:07:58.770,00:08:00.439,Lou...
00:08:03.817,00:08:09.448,"I don't need to remind you that this Christmas marks the 1,000th Whobilation."
00:08:09.448,00:08:11.408,Whoville's most important celebration.
00:08:11.408,00:08:15.870,"And the Book of Who says, very clearly..."
00:08:16.997,00:08:24.504,Every size of Who we can measure knows that Whobilation is a time we must treasure.
00:08:24.504,00:08:34.597,Please tell me that your boys were not up on Mount Crumpit provoking the one creature within a billion bilometers of here who hates Christmas!
00:08:34.597,00:08:36.433,But it was the Grinch!
00:08:36.433,00:08:38.143,"No, no, no, sir."
00:08:38.143,00:08:40.603,The boys didn't see any Grinch.
00:08:40.603,00:08:42.772,- They-- - He came right after us!
00:08:42.772,00:08:47.235,I think they were just up on the mountain playing with matches or defacing public property.
00:08:47.235,00:08:51.198,"Oh, well, that's a relief."
00:08:51.198,00:08:56.286,"All right, you heard the man, there's no Grinch problem here."
00:09:03.335,00:09:05.545,Man: I need it there by tomorrow.
00:09:05.545,00:09:08.715,Heck of a rush.
00:09:08.715,00:09:10.758,- Heck of a rush.
00:09:12.635,00:09:16.515,"But, Dad, I just don't understand something."
00:09:16.515,00:09:19.518,Why won't anyone talk about the Grinch?
00:09:19.518,00:09:22.145,You kids and the Grinch.
00:09:22.145,00:09:27.567,"You see, Cindy, the Grinch is a Who who, well, is actually not a Who."
00:09:27.567,00:09:31.446,He's-- he's more of a-- A what?
00:09:31.446,00:09:33.781,"Exactly, honey."
00:09:33.781,00:09:37.118,He's a what who doesn't like Christmas.
00:09:37.118,00:09:39.246,"Take a look at his mailbox, sweetie."
00:09:39.246,00:09:43.083,"Not a single Christmas card, in or out."
00:09:43.083,00:09:44.543,Ever.
00:09:44.543,00:09:45.710,But why?
00:09:45.710,00:09:47.628,- Well-- - Where's my mail?
00:09:47.628,00:09:49.839,I've got the wrong mail here.
00:09:49.839,00:09:52.342,"Lou, I got the wrong mail!"
00:09:53.552,00:09:55.470,I'll be right there.
00:09:55.470,00:09:56.930,- Woop.
00:09:56.930,00:09:59.599,"All right, we'll straighten this out."
00:10:02.894,00:10:05.813,It'll take them years to sort this out.
00:10:05.813,00:10:07.190,"This is his, and now it's yours."
00:10:07.190,00:10:08.816,"This is hers, and now it's his."
00:10:11.652,00:10:13.863,And for the rest of you...
00:10:15.407,00:10:22.038,"jury duty, jury duty, jury duty, blackmail, pink slip, chain letter, eviction notice, jury duty."
00:10:26.585,00:10:31.256,"Would you mind helping me take this to the back room, honey?"
00:10:31.256,00:10:33.716,"But be careful of the sorting machine, right?"
00:10:33.716,00:10:34.968,Yeah.
00:11:09.210,00:11:10.420,Whew.
00:11:11.754,00:11:13.590,Gesundheit.
00:11:13.590,00:11:14.966,AAH!
00:11:14.966,00:11:16.092,AAH!
00:11:16.092,00:11:19.137,- AAH!
00:11:21.722,00:11:23.808,You're the-- the-- the-- the...
00:11:23.808,00:11:25.143,The-- the-- the...
00:11:25.143,00:11:26.478,The Grinch!
00:11:29.230,00:11:30.689,Well...
00:11:30.689,00:11:32.442,that worked out nicely.
00:11:32.442,00:11:33.818,Help!
00:11:42.536,00:11:44.538,Help me!
00:11:44.538,00:11:46.414,"- Max, let's go."
00:11:46.414,00:11:48.583,Our work here is finished.
00:11:52.753,00:11:55.465,That is not a chew toy!
00:11:55.465,00:11:56.841,"Stop it, Max."
00:11:56.841,00:11:58.259,Get that out of your mouth.
00:11:58.259,00:12:00.512,You have no idea where's it's been.
00:12:05.099,00:12:06.601,Help!
00:12:06.601,00:12:08.562,Aww!
00:12:08.562,00:12:12.524,Bleeding hearts of the world unite!
00:12:12.524,00:12:13.774,Help!
00:12:13.774,00:12:15.610,Help!
00:12:19.822,00:12:21.032,There!
00:12:21.032,00:12:22.825,Give me that!
00:12:22.825,00:12:26.745,Don't you know you're not supposed to take things that don't belong to you?
00:12:24.661,00:12:28.373,"What's the matter with you, you some kind of wild animal?"
00:12:28.373,00:12:30.500,Huh?!
00:12:30.500,00:12:32.544,Let's go.
00:12:32.544,00:12:33.961,Thanks for saving me.
00:12:40.885,00:12:43.722,Saving you?
00:12:43.722,00:12:45.932,Is that what you think I was doing?
00:12:45.932,00:12:47.684,Uh-huh.
00:12:48.893,00:12:50.228,Wrong-o.
00:12:51.938,00:12:57.151,"I merely noticed that you're improperly packaged, my dear."
00:12:59.487,00:13:00.863,Hold still!
00:13:00.863,00:13:02.365,"Max, pick out a bow."
00:13:03.742,00:13:06.327,Can I use your finger for a second?
00:13:06.327,00:13:08.204,Cindy: Hello? Hello!
00:13:09.456,00:13:10.789,Ow.
00:13:12.833,00:13:14.377,- Cindy?
00:13:15.878,00:13:17.672,Daddy.
00:13:17.672,00:13:19.798,Daddy!
00:13:19.798,00:13:21.217,What the hey?
00:13:22.385,00:13:24.262,Honey?
00:13:24.262,00:13:25.888,Cindy?
00:13:25.888,00:13:27.599,"Dad, it was amazing."
00:13:27.599,00:13:31.227,You've been practicing your Christmas wrapping.
00:13:31.227,00:13:32.729,I am so proud of you!
00:13:32.729,00:13:35.022,Oh-- oh.
00:13:32.729,00:13:36.899,"Well-- Now, that's holiday!"
00:13:36.899,00:13:40.570,Narrator: Sweet little Cindy didn't know what to do.
00:13:40.570,00:13:43.657,"In her head, bumtumbled a conflict or two."
00:13:43.657,00:13:47.368,"If the Grinch was so bad, then why did he save me?"
00:13:47.368,00:13:49.078,Maybe he wasn't so bad.
00:13:49.078,00:13:51.872,Come on.
00:13:56.711,00:13:59.339,No lights on in the house.
00:13:59.339,00:14:01.257,"Oh, good, I'm so glad you're home."
00:14:01.257,00:14:04.093,"Oh, I can feel it, Lou."
00:14:04.093,00:14:14.853,"This is the year when everybody asks who has the most spectacular lights in all of greater Whoville, they're gonna cry out, Mrs. Betty Lou Who."
00:14:14.853,00:14:17.898,Isn't this the chandelier from the dining room?
00:14:17.898,00:14:20.109,"It's all for the cause, dear."
00:14:20.109,00:14:26.157,"Oh, and, Cindy, could you be Mommy's little helper and unscrew the bulb there from the refrigerator?"
00:14:26.157,00:14:27.784,Somehow I missed that one.
00:14:27.784,00:14:29.452,Go on.
00:14:33.623,00:14:39.253,"Every year, Martha May Whovier, has the best lights."
00:14:39.253,00:14:41.589,"Well, not this year."
00:14:41.589,00:14:48.262,"This year, I'm gonna beat that prim, perfect, little prissy-- Betty!"
00:14:48.262,00:14:50.765,Hi!
00:14:50.765,00:14:52.225,Martha!
00:14:52.225,00:14:56.479,"Why, I've never seen so many beautiful Christmas lights."
00:14:56.479,00:14:59.649,I'd blow every fuse if I tried to keep up with you.
00:15:00.859,00:15:03.319,Isn't this antique darling?
00:15:03.319,00:15:07.281,It's handcrafted and almost 100 years old.
00:15:07.281,00:15:09.868,"Oh, please, I'm really impressed."
00:15:09.868,00:15:13.120,"This, however, is new."
00:15:24.424,00:15:26.843,"Whoa, whoa. Hey, Betty."
00:15:43.317,00:15:45.779,"Well, good night, Betty."
00:15:49.657,00:15:51.951,- I got it.
00:15:51.951,00:15:53.160,Hello?
00:15:54.829,00:15:57.582,Is my Sub-Zero Chillibrator running?
00:15:57.582,00:15:58.750,I suppose.
00:15:58.750,00:16:01.419,"Well, then you better go catch it!"
00:16:08.885,00:16:10.970,"Oh, that's a good one."
00:16:10.970,00:16:12.305,That is rich.
00:16:15.600,00:16:16.976,Let's go home.
00:16:20.480,00:16:23.650,Ah!
00:16:23.650,00:16:24.901,Thank you.
00:16:28.488,00:16:30.448,Come on!
00:16:45.212,00:16:48.675,There's got to be a better way!
00:17:10.237,00:17:12.824,A car would have paid for itself by now.
00:17:14.408,00:17:15.576,"Oh, goody!"
00:17:15.576,00:17:18.245,Another load coming now.
00:17:18.245,00:17:20.832,Whee! Ha ha!
00:17:20.832,00:17:24.168,Ugh! What is that stench?
00:17:24.168,00:17:26.086,It's fantastic!
00:17:27.922,00:17:30.049,"Max, grab a bag."
00:17:30.049,00:17:33.135,We'll come back for the rest.
00:17:33.135,00:17:36.305,"Of course, when I say we, I mean you."
00:17:36.305,00:17:40.476,It's amazing what these Whos just throw away.
00:17:40.476,00:17:42.603,"Oh, well."
00:17:42.603,00:17:45.899,One man's toxic sludge is another man's potpourri.
00:17:45.899,00:17:47.233,- I don't know.
00:17:47.233,00:17:49.151,It's some kind of soup.
00:19:45.267,00:19:48.312,"Oh, sweet!"
00:20:10.626,00:20:13.004,"First floor, factory rejects."
00:20:14.296,00:20:19.969,"Those Whos are hard to frazzle, Max, but we did our worst, and that's all that matters."
00:20:19.969,00:20:23.681,At least I scared the bejeebles out of that little girl at the post office.
00:20:23.681,00:20:26.142,"She'll be scarred for life, if we're lucky."
00:20:42.783,00:20:45.078,"Funny she didn't rat on us, though."
00:20:45.078,00:20:47.663,Must be afraid of reprisals.
00:20:59.175,00:21:00.760,Yes!
00:21:00.760,00:21:03.387,Down a size and a half!
00:21:04.513,00:21:07.225,"And this time, I'll keep it off."
00:21:09.102,00:21:11.311,Get the stick.
00:21:14.774,00:21:18.069,There's no stick.
00:21:18.069,00:21:19.528,I'm smarter.
00:21:25.451,00:21:27.286,Any calls?
00:21:29.496,00:21:31.874,Machine: You have no messages.
00:21:31.874,00:21:33.709,Odd.
00:21:33.709,00:21:36.378,Better check the outgoing.
00:21:36.378,00:21:43.677,"Grinch on tape: If you utter so much as one syllable, I'll hunt you down and gut you like a fish!"
00:21:43.677,00:21:45.805,"If you'd like to fax me, press the star key."
00:21:45.805,00:21:48.432,- Hm.
00:21:48.432,00:21:50.059,"Oh, well."
00:21:55.564,00:21:57.900,That's more like it.
00:22:16.710,00:22:17.962,Mmm.
00:22:17.962,00:22:19.421,Excellent year.
00:22:19.421,00:22:24.635,"I'll tell you, Max, I don't know why I ever leave this place."
00:22:24.635,00:22:29.890,I've got all the company I need right here.
00:22:29.890,00:22:31.433,Hello!
00:22:31.433,00:22:33.686,Hello!
00:22:33.686,00:22:34.854,How are you?
00:22:34.854,00:22:36.981,How are you?
00:22:36.981,00:22:38.274,I asked you first!
00:22:38.274,00:22:40.276,I asked you first!
00:22:40.276,00:22:44.864,"Oh, that's really mature, saying exactly what I say."
00:22:44.864,00:22:48.450,...saying exactly what I say.
00:22:49.827,00:22:50.995,I'm an idiot!
00:22:50.995,00:22:54.040,Echo: You're an idiot!
00:22:55.833,00:22:57.293,"All right, fine!"
00:22:57.293,00:22:59.170,I'm not talking to you anymore.
00:22:59.170,00:23:08.929,"In fact, I'm going to whisper so that by the time my voice reverberates off the walls and gets back to me, I won't be able to hear it."
00:23:10.097,00:23:11.849,Echo: You're an idiot!
00:23:23.986,00:23:27.240,Am I just eating because I'm bored?
00:23:36.332,00:23:38.625,"Oh, who could that be?"
00:23:40.253,00:23:41.670,"Hello, little girl."
00:23:41.670,00:23:43.505,Are you here to read to us?
00:23:43.505,00:23:47.343,No. I hear you know some things about the Grinch.
00:23:47.343,00:23:52.014,Narrator: Cindy Lou had some questions in her curious heart.
00:23:52.014,00:23:54.058,Why did the Grinch hate Christmas?
00:23:54.058,00:23:56.227,Where did it all start?
00:23:56.227,00:23:59.188,With her dad's blabbacorder she wouldn't give an inch.
00:23:59.188,00:24:04.110,"In your own words, please tell me everything you know about the Grinch."
00:24:04.110,00:24:05.861,Where did he come from?
00:24:05.861,00:24:09.823,"Oh, well-- He came the way all Who babies come."
00:24:11.491,00:24:22.628,"Clarnella: On calm nights, baby Who girls and tiny Who fellas drift from the sky in their own pumbersellas."
00:24:30.594,00:24:33.722,"Hey, honey, our baby's here!"
00:24:35.766,00:24:38.436,He looks just like your boss.
00:24:38.436,00:24:41.397,"Oh, so that's how it works."
00:24:41.397,00:24:42.648,Mm-hmm.
00:24:42.648,00:24:47.736,"It was Christmas Eve, and a strange wind blew that night."
00:25:14.596,00:25:17.391,We were having our annual holiday get-together.
00:25:36.369,00:25:38.037,Come on.
00:25:39.746,00:25:45.961,"It was morning before anybody realized that he was out there, the poor dear."
00:25:45.961,00:25:47.838,"But, you know what?"
00:25:47.838,00:25:50.007,We knew right away that he was special.
00:25:55.137,00:25:58.349,Do you want a Christmas cookie?
00:25:58.349,00:26:01.060,Which Christmas cookie would you like?
00:26:01.060,00:26:03.854,- Santa.
00:26:03.854,00:26:04.980,His first word.
00:26:04.980,00:26:07.565,"Yes, that is a Santa plate."
00:26:07.565,00:26:09.943,Do you wanna hold the Santa plate?
00:26:09.943,00:26:11.362,Oh!
00:26:17.284,00:26:19.661,"Santa, bye-bye."
00:26:22.915,00:26:28.837,"Oh, he was a wonderful-- oh, whatever he was."
00:26:28.837,00:26:34.634,And we raised him like any other Who child with a deep love of Christmas.
00:26:36.929,00:26:41.183,"Teacher: Don't forget, tomorrow is our big Christmas gift exchange."
00:26:41.183,00:26:46.604,Everyone bring a special gift for a special someone.
00:26:46.604,00:26:48.815,The Grinch?
00:26:48.815,00:26:50.401,Uh-huh.
00:26:50.401,00:26:54.029,He had no sense of color coordination.
00:26:54.029,00:26:55.906,Although I hardly remember him.
00:26:55.906,00:26:57.783,I didn't have time to socialize.
00:26:57.783,00:27:01.245,I was far too busy with my...
00:27:01.245,00:27:02.580,studies.
00:27:02.580,00:27:06.208,"Now, class, is everyone almost finished, hm?"
00:27:07.376,00:27:11.422,"Mayor: And if the truth be told he, um, he liked Martha."
00:27:12.714,00:27:15.426,Martha was my girlfriend.
00:27:17.177,00:27:24.851,"I don't like discussing this Grinch so very close to Christmas, but maybe if you hear the truth, you'll understand why."
00:27:24.851,00:27:27.563,Put your back into it!
00:27:27.563,00:27:30.483,I tried to take him under my wing.
00:27:30.483,00:27:32.276,You don't have a chance with her.
00:27:32.276,00:27:34.987,You're eight years old and you have a beard.
00:27:38.449,00:27:39.825,He had hair.
00:27:39.825,00:27:41.368,Not pleasant.
00:27:43.162,00:27:44.788,He shed.
00:27:44.788,00:27:46.123,Not right.
00:27:47.958,00:27:51.920,"You know, Christmas is my favorite time of year."
00:27:51.920,00:27:58.218,"I just love the colors, red... and green."
00:28:01.514,00:28:03.432,Did I have a crush on the Grinch?
00:28:03.432,00:28:06.226,"Well, of course not."
00:28:06.226,00:28:08.145,I didn't ask you that.
00:28:09.355,00:28:11.815,"Oh, right."
00:28:11.815,00:28:18.696,"Clarnella: For some reason, when he came home that day, he really got into the Christmas spirit for the first time."
00:28:18.696,00:28:21.992,Perfect!
00:28:23.785,00:28:25.120,Oopsie.
00:28:28.123,00:28:29.500,Ah!
00:28:31.877,00:28:34.505,What a lovely family heirloom.
00:28:34.505,00:28:36.798,Ho ho!
00:28:43.430,00:28:46.433,Whoo-hoo!
00:28:46.433,00:28:48.435,The fires of love.
00:28:50.896,00:28:53.482,This will be perfect on top of her tree.
00:28:53.482,00:28:56.485,"Oh, Martha."
00:29:02.741,00:29:07.037,I want you all to look your best tomorrow.
00:29:07.037,00:29:08.955,You don't have a chance with her.
00:29:08.955,00:29:12.167,You're eight years old and you have a beard.
00:29:27.558,00:29:29.351,Teacher: Has everyone given their gifts?
00:29:29.351,00:29:31.103,I haven't.
00:29:31.103,00:29:32.563,Kids: Huh?
00:29:39.278,00:29:41.071,"Merry Christmas, Martha May."
00:29:42.322,00:29:45.242,Why do you have a bag on your head?
00:29:45.242,00:29:49.788,Probably because he's embarrassed by that hideoderous gift.
00:29:51.248,00:29:56.878,"Mr. Grinch, please take the bag off."
00:29:56.878,00:29:59.881,"Yes, you take it off."
00:30:04.344,00:30:06.555,Put the book down.
00:30:10.726,00:30:13.103,And your foot.
00:30:15.230,00:30:17.274,Look at that hack job.
00:30:28.368,00:30:29.703,Stupid present!
00:30:30.746,00:30:32.998,Stupid tree!
00:30:32.998,00:30:36.042,I hate Christmas!
00:30:36.042,00:30:37.336,The anger.
00:30:37.336,00:30:38.545,The fury.
00:30:38.545,00:30:41.757,The muscles.
00:30:52.184,00:30:53.602,Martha May: It was a horrible day...
00:30:55.020,00:30:57.272,when they were so cruel to him.
00:30:57.272,00:30:58.607,And...
00:31:00.192,00:31:01.985,I could hardly bear it.
00:31:17.459,00:31:19.961,I hate Christmas.
00:31:19.961,00:31:22.047,I hate it!
00:31:22.047,00:31:24.924,Martha May: And that was the last time we ever saw him.
00:31:27.386,00:31:29.471,The very last time.
00:32:21.273,00:32:30.532,"Narrator: So, whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes, he stood outside his cave hating the Whos."
00:32:30.532,00:32:32.492,Alphabetically.
00:32:34.411,00:32:38.415,"Aardvarkian Abakenezer Who, I..."
00:32:38.415,00:32:43.253,hate you!
00:32:45.297,00:32:48.759,"Aaron B. Benson Who, I hate you."
00:32:48.759,00:32:50.009,"Hate, hate, hate."
00:32:50.009,00:32:51.303,"Hate, hate, hate."
00:32:51.303,00:32:56.975,Double hate-- loathe entirely!
00:33:03.523,00:33:06.318,Nutcrackers!
00:33:06.318,00:33:09.279,It's their Whobilation.
00:33:09.279,00:33:12.616,Narrator: He snarled with a sneer.
00:33:12.616,00:33:14.409,Tomorrow is Christmas.
00:33:14.409,00:33:17.621,It's practically here.
00:33:17.621,00:33:19.164,Max!
00:33:19.164,00:33:22.000,Fetch me my sedative!
00:33:23.335,00:33:26.797,Now to take care of those pesky memories.
00:33:36.974,00:33:38.350,- Dad?
00:33:38.350,00:33:40.352,I've been thinking about the Whobilation.
00:33:40.352,00:33:42.270,I may do something drastic.
00:33:42.270,00:33:44.648,"That's fine, dear."
00:33:44.648,00:33:45.899,Where'd she go?
00:33:45.899,00:33:47.609,Honey!
00:33:47.609,00:33:49.110,"Honey, hi."
00:33:49.110,00:33:50.570,"Oh, look."
00:33:50.570,00:33:53.406,I just found the cutest light for my Christmas display.
00:33:55.158,00:33:57.076,"Hurry up, we're going to be late. Come on."
00:34:01.832,00:34:03.166,Ooh.
00:34:16.555,00:34:25.230,And now the nominations for that Who among us who best typifies the qualities of Who-dom and Who-dery.
00:34:25.230,00:34:29.192,The Whoville Holiday Cheermeister!
00:34:37.534,00:34:39.494,Do I hear...
00:34:39.494,00:34:40.704,a nomination?
00:34:40.704,00:34:42.121,Cindy Lou: I nominate the Grinch!
00:34:42.121,00:34:44.624,Crowd: Huh?!
00:34:44.624,00:34:46.835,- The Grinch?
00:34:49.170,00:34:51.256,"My, my, my."
00:34:51.256,00:34:55.052,"What an altruistic daughter you have there, Lou."
00:34:55.052,00:34:56.887,Thank you.
00:34:58.513,00:35:00.223,Cindy!
00:35:02.935,00:35:08.189,Let me quote a verse from the Book of Who.
00:35:08.189,00:35:09.983,Thank you.
00:35:09.983,00:35:15.280,The term 'Grinchy' shall apply when Christmas spirit is in short supply.
00:35:15.280,00:35:18.867,"Now I ask you, does that sound like our Holiday Cheermeister?"
00:35:18.867,00:35:29.168,"True, Mr. May Who, but the Book of Who says this, too: No matter how different a Who may appear, he will always be welcomed with holiday cheer."
00:35:29.168,00:35:31.379,"Oh, come to think of that, I knew that."
00:35:31.379,00:35:36.718,"Well, yes, but the book also says, The award..."
00:35:36.718,00:35:43.600,"cannot go to the Grinch because sometimes things get, uh, lead pipe cinch."
00:35:43.600,00:35:46.103,You made that up.
00:35:46.103,00:35:49.564,"No, no, no, it does."
00:35:49.564,00:35:51.984,What page?
00:35:51.984,00:35:54.360,Uh... oh!
00:35:54.360,00:35:58.865,"Lost my, uh, place, but it's-- it's in here."
00:35:58.865,00:36:04.496,"But the book does say, The Cheermeister is the one who deserves a backslap or a toast."
00:36:04.496,00:36:08.000,And it goes to the soul at Christmas who needs it most.
00:36:08.000,00:36:11.086,And I believe that soul is the Grinch.
00:36:11.086,00:36:16.716,"And if you're the Whos I hope you are, you will, too."
00:36:16.716,00:36:18.468,"She's right, you know."
00:36:23.181,00:36:25.767,Mayor: Fine. Fine.
00:36:25.767,00:36:37.529,"If you people want to waste a perfectly good nomination, why, it's up to you, but I am telling you, the Grinch will never come down."
00:36:37.529,00:36:40.573,"And when he doesn't, the Mayor will wear the crown!"
00:36:40.573,00:36:42.826,"Well, more or less."
00:37:06.516,00:37:25.660,"Grinch, joining in: Blast this Christmas music!"
00:37:25.660,00:37:28.872,It's joyful and triumphant.
00:37:28.872,00:37:31.541,Must drown them out!
00:37:40.592,00:37:43.678,Not working!
00:37:43.678,00:37:47.640,Narrator: The whipperwinds whipped high above the Who town.
00:37:47.640,00:37:51.603,"A trip or a slip, you'd slide all the way down."
00:37:51.603,00:37:53.897,But this girl had a mission.
00:37:53.897,00:37:55.273,She knew what to do.
00:37:55.273,00:38:00.237,"She'd invite the Grinch herself, that brave Cindy Lou."
00:38:08.120,00:38:10.080,"Play, monkey!"
00:38:10.080,00:38:13.416,Play!
00:38:23.802,00:38:25.929,Grinch: Ow-weee!
00:38:28.765,00:38:30.600,Mr. Grinch?
00:38:33.270,00:38:35.354,Mr. Grinch?
00:38:40.026,00:38:41.903,Hello?
00:39:07.345,00:39:08.554,Excuse me.
00:39:08.554,00:39:09.973,Hm?
00:39:24.196,00:39:28.616,"Hello, little girl."
00:39:28.616,00:39:34.039,How dare you enter the Grinch's lair!
00:39:34.039,00:39:35.290,The impudence!
00:39:35.290,00:39:37.542,The audacity!
00:39:37.542,00:39:40.170,The unmitigated gall!
00:39:40.170,00:39:46.509,"You called down the thunder, now get ready for the boom!"
00:39:46.509,00:39:51.056,Gaze into the face of fear!
00:39:51.056,00:39:52.349,Booga-booga!
00:39:52.349,00:39:55.352,Mr. Grinch...
00:39:55.352,00:39:57.354,my name is Cindy Lou Who.
00:39:57.354,00:39:58.771,You see?
00:39:58.771,00:40:03.276,Even now the terror is welling up inside you.
00:40:03.276,00:40:05.904,I'm not scared.
00:40:05.904,00:40:09.991,Denial is to be expected in the face of pure evil.
00:40:12.410,00:40:14.954,I don't think so.
00:40:14.954,00:40:16.122,Doubt!
00:40:16.122,00:40:20.752,Another unmistakable sign of the heebie-jeebies.
00:40:20.752,00:40:22.587,Now you're...
00:40:22.587,00:40:25.382,doomed!
00:40:32.055,00:40:33.932,Run for your life...
00:40:33.932,00:40:36.976,before I kill again!
00:40:39.771,00:40:41.522,I'm a psycho.
00:40:44.483,00:40:46.569,Danger! Danger!
00:40:56.037,00:40:58.790,Maybe you need a time-out.
00:41:03.753,00:41:05.088,Kids today...
00:41:05.088,00:41:08.883,so desensitized by movies and television.
00:41:08.883,00:41:10.509,What do you want?!
00:41:11.594,00:41:17.976,"Mr. Grinch, I came to invite you to be Holiday Cheermeister."
00:41:20.145,00:41:21.646,Holiday Whobie-whatie?
00:41:21.646,00:41:23.231,Cheermeister.
00:41:23.231,00:41:26.401,Heh? Cheermeister.
00:41:30.655,00:41:33.032,That's a good one.
00:41:33.032,00:41:37.370,"I know you hate Christmas, but what if it's all just a misunderstanding?"
00:41:37.370,00:41:39.456,- Don't care.
00:41:37.370,00:41:40.665,"- I, myself, am having some yuletide doubts."
00:41:41.958,00:41:48.798,But maybe if you can reunite with the Whos and be a part of Christmas-- Maybe if you can reunite with the Whos and be a part of Christmas-- grow up!
00:41:48.798,00:41:51.717,"Then maybe it'll be all right for me, too."
00:41:51.717,00:41:56.431,"I'm sorry, your session is over."
00:41:56.431,00:41:59.184,"Please, you have to accept the award."
00:42:04.314,00:42:06.483,Award?
00:42:08.485,00:42:10.403,You never mentioned...
00:42:10.403,00:42:12.280,an award.
00:42:12.280,00:42:14.407,"Yeah, with a trophy and everything."
00:42:14.407,00:42:16.451,- And I won?
00:42:17.618,00:42:18.870,That means there were losers.
00:42:18.870,00:42:20.872,I guess.
00:42:18.870,00:42:25.168,So if you could-- A town full of losers!
00:42:25.168,00:42:27.379,I like it.
00:42:27.379,00:42:30.840,Was anyone...
00:42:30.840,00:42:32.509,"Come on, a minute ago I couldn't shut you up!"
00:42:32.509,00:42:34.260,"Details, details."
00:42:34.260,00:42:36.888,"Well, the mayor wasn't happy."
00:42:36.888,00:42:39.015,Oh...
00:42:39.015,00:42:40.892,no.
00:42:40.892,00:42:42.852,Martha May will be there.
00:42:43.895,00:42:45.146,"Oh, she will?"
00:42:45.146,00:42:46.939,Mm-hmm.
00:42:46.939,00:42:48.900,And she'll see me...
00:42:48.900,00:42:50.151,a winner.
00:42:51.444,00:42:55.740,She'll be on me like fleegle flies on a flatfaced floogle horse.
00:42:55.740,00:43:00.578,"Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Martha, baby, but the G-train has left the station!"
00:43:00.578,00:43:01.829,"So, will you come?"
00:43:03.248,00:43:05.458,"Oh, all right."
00:43:05.458,00:43:06.792,I don't know if it's that...
00:43:06.792,00:43:15.552,"adorable twinkle in your eye, or the nonconformist streak that reminds me of a younger, less hairy me, but you've convinced me."
00:43:15.552,00:43:17.136,Who knows?
00:43:17.136,00:43:21.266,This Whobilation could change my entire outlook on life!
00:43:21.266,00:43:22.517,Really?
00:43:22.517,00:43:23.893,No.
00:43:30.108,00:43:31.359,Hm.
00:43:31.359,00:43:33.861,Eek! Ha ha ha!
00:43:38.575,00:43:40.285,Huh?
00:43:46.499,00:43:48.751,Whee!
00:43:52.964,00:43:54.924,Oh!
00:43:57.510,00:43:58.970,"There you are, honey!"
00:43:58.970,00:44:02.140,You can make snow angels later.
00:44:02.140,00:44:04.267,We can't be late for the Whobilation.
00:44:08.062,00:44:12.900,"The nerve of the those Whos, inviting me down there on such short notice!"
00:44:12.900,00:44:16.946,"Even if I wanted to go, my schedule wouldn't allow it!"
00:44:18.990,00:44:21.534,"4:00, wallow in self pity."
00:44:21.534,00:44:25.622,"4:30, stare into the abyss."
00:44:25.622,00:44:27.582,"5:00, solve world hunger..."
00:44:27.582,00:44:29.584,tell no one.
00:44:29.584,00:44:31.794,"5:30, jazzercise."
00:44:31.794,00:44:33.296,"6:30, dinner with me."
00:44:33.296,00:44:35.298,I can't cancel that again.
00:44:35.298,00:44:38.343,"7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing."
00:44:38.343,00:44:40.512,I'm booked.
00:44:40.512,00:44:48.269,"Of course, if I bump the loathing to 9:00, I'd be done in time to lay in bed, stare at the ceiling, and slip slowly into madness."
00:44:48.269,00:44:50.480,But what would I wear?
00:45:09.790,00:45:14.086,"It's not a dress, it's a kilt!"
00:45:14.086,00:45:15.712,Sicko.
00:45:17.382,00:45:19.800,Stupid. Ugly.
00:45:19.800,00:45:21.678,Out-of-date.
00:45:22.761,00:45:24.389,This is ridiculous.
00:45:24.389,00:45:27.975,"If I can't find something nice to wear, I'm not going!"
00:45:41.197,00:45:43.115,Oh.
00:45:43.115,00:45:44.367,Ah.
00:45:44.367,00:45:45.910,Mmm.
00:45:45.910,00:45:48.329,That's it.
00:45:59.924,00:46:04.803,"Well, it's time for our Holiday Cheermeister of the Year award!"
00:46:10.518,00:46:14.564,"Congratulations, Mr. Grinch!"
00:46:14.564,00:46:15.814,Oh.
00:46:17.066,00:46:18.693,He isn't here.
00:46:18.693,00:46:20.945,What?
00:46:20.945,00:46:23.197,He didn't show?
00:46:24.449,00:46:27.784,Who could have predicted this?
00:46:27.784,00:46:28.994,All right.
00:46:28.994,00:46:35.293,"I'll swing by for a minute, allow them to envy me, grab a handful of popcorn shrimp and blow out of there."
00:46:35.293,00:46:37.587,But what if it's a cruel prank?
00:46:37.587,00:46:39.714,What if it's a cash bar?
00:46:39.714,00:46:42.258,How dare they?
00:46:42.258,00:46:45.386,"All right, I'll go, but I'll be fashionably late."
00:46:45.386,00:46:47.012,"No. Yes, no, yes."
00:46:47.012,00:46:48.347,No! Yes!
00:46:48.347,00:46:50.642,Ohh...
00:46:50.642,00:46:52.518,Definitely not.
00:46:52.518,00:46:55.271,"All right, I've made my decision."
00:46:55.271,00:46:58.357,"I'm going, and that's that."
00:46:58.357,00:47:00.610,"Oh, had my fingers crossed."
00:47:00.610,00:47:02.403,Whoa!
00:47:04.697,00:47:07.700,Maybe I should flip a coin!
00:47:14.915,00:47:18.544,"Well, I guess the award goes to the..."
00:47:18.544,00:47:20.087,the runner-up.
00:47:21.255,00:47:22.757,That's right.
00:47:22.757,00:47:28.012,"A man for whom Christmas comes not once a year, but every minute of every day."
00:47:28.012,00:47:31.516,"A handsome, noble man."
00:47:31.516,00:47:34.226,A man who's had his tonsils removed twice!
00:47:34.226,00:47:36.979,That's an interesting story.
00:47:36.979,00:47:45.613,"You see, what happened was-- Aa-aah!"
00:47:45.613,00:47:46.863,Unh!
00:47:46.863,00:47:48.825,Aah!
00:47:53.996,00:47:55.331,"Hello, Martha."
00:47:55.331,00:47:56.499,He made it!
00:47:56.499,00:47:57.916,- Cindy?
00:48:22.191,00:48:24.985,- Boo.
00:48:24.985,00:48:27.697,"Hm, hot crowd."
00:48:29.824,00:48:32.076,I believe I'm here to...
00:48:33.452,00:48:34.871,accept...
00:48:34.871,00:48:37.832,an award of some kind.
00:48:37.832,00:48:41.419,"And, uh, the child..."
00:48:41.419,00:48:43.003,mentioned a check.
00:48:43.003,00:48:44.338,"No, I didn't."
00:48:44.338,00:48:45.798,"All right, then give me the award."
00:48:45.798,00:48:47.966,"Come on, while I'm young!"
00:48:47.966,00:48:52.346,"Don't you worry, Mr. Holiday Cheermeister, you'll get your award."
00:48:52.346,00:48:57.435,"But first, a little family reunion."
00:48:57.435,00:48:58.686,They nursed you.
00:48:58.686,00:49:00.646,They clothed you.
00:49:00.646,00:49:05.109,"Here they are, your old biddies!"
00:49:06.068,00:49:10.030,Are you two still living?
00:49:10.030,00:49:12.450,We missed you!
00:49:12.450,00:49:14.911,"Rose, the sweater."
00:49:14.911,00:49:16.454,Sweater? What are you talking about?
00:49:16.454,00:49:20.625,"No, I can't do this."
00:49:22.000,00:49:23.544,Don't touch me there.
00:49:23.544,00:49:25.962,Get off!
00:49:27.924,00:49:30.092,AAH!
00:49:31.552,00:49:33.888,Put him in the Chair of Cheer!
00:49:33.888,00:49:35.139,Chair of Cheer?
00:49:35.139,00:49:36.849,What's the Chair of Cheer?
00:49:36.849,00:49:39.644,Huh? You didn't tell me about the Chair of Cheer!
00:49:39.644,00:49:42.354,"Please, Mr. Grinch?"
00:49:42.354,00:49:44.565,"No, no, no, I can't do it."
00:49:44.565,00:49:46.901,"Honestly, I'm not ready."
00:49:46.901,00:49:48.444,"Mayor: Yes, it's that time of year."
00:49:48.444,00:49:52.239,The Cheermeister's ride in the Chair of Cheer!
00:49:52.239,00:49:53.658,Put me down!
00:49:53.658,00:49:55.868,I mean it!
00:49:55.868,00:49:57.870,There'll be hell to pay!
00:49:58.995,00:50:00.205,First...
00:50:00.205,00:50:03.960,you'll put your taste buds to the test as you judge the Who-Pudding...
00:50:03.960,00:50:05.628,- Who-Pudding...
00:50:05.628,00:50:06.879,Cook-off!
00:50:06.879,00:50:08.088,Mine first!
00:50:08.088,00:50:11.550,"I really don't know-- No, mine's the best!"
00:50:11.550,00:50:13.177,You'll enjoy this.
00:50:13.177,00:50:16.681,Heh heh!
00:50:16.681,00:50:19.015,What is it?
00:50:19.015,00:50:21.393,"Aw, no..."
00:50:22.979,00:50:24.897,Mayor: Christmas Conga!
00:50:24.897,00:50:27.358,"Gee, look at the time."
00:50:27.358,00:50:29.527,AAH!
00:50:35.115,00:50:36.909,Fruitcake Fa-la-la!
00:50:37.994,00:50:39.286,No.
00:50:41.079,00:50:44.000,Whoop... ugh...
00:50:44.000,00:50:46.418,Fudge Judge.
00:50:48.086,00:50:49.547,Made it myself.
00:50:49.547,00:50:52.508,"- Oh, yeah?"
00:50:54.552,00:50:55.803,Put it in!
00:50:55.803,00:50:57.053,Come on!
00:50:57.053,00:50:59.223,Is that all you got?
00:50:59.223,00:51:01.266,Is that all you got?
00:51:02.476,00:51:05.270,Cheermeister! Cheermeister!
00:51:06.814,00:51:08.148,"Out of the way, slo-mo!"
00:51:10.150,00:51:11.610,Beep beep.
00:51:19.827,00:51:23.789,Aah-- Yay!
00:51:23.789,00:51:26.918,He's number one in the sack race!
00:51:26.918,00:51:28.252,Number one!
00:51:28.252,00:51:30.254,I'm number one!
00:51:30.254,00:51:32.590,I'm number one!
00:51:32.590,00:51:36.010,No child can beat the Grinch!
00:51:36.010,00:51:37.261,Yeah!
00:51:37.261,00:51:39.597,Whoo!
00:51:41.223,00:51:44.142,I beat you!
00:51:54.110,00:51:58.032,And now it's time for the moment we've all been waiting for.
00:51:58.032,00:51:59.992,"Ah, yes. My award."
00:51:59.992,00:52:02.286,- And the check.
00:52:02.286,00:52:03.996,Are you sure?
00:52:03.996,00:52:05.998,I really thought I heard someone mention a check.
00:52:05.998,00:52:07.374,I said there's no check.
00:52:07.374,00:52:10.335,Now it's time for Present Pass-It-On!
00:52:11.879,00:52:14.715,"As always, we start with our Cheermeister."
00:52:23.181,00:52:25.684,The gift of a Christmas shave.
00:52:40.240,00:52:42.743,Young May Who: Look at that hack job.
00:52:52.210,00:52:56.715,"Ah, yes, yes."
00:52:56.715,00:52:58.009,Good times.
00:52:58.009,00:53:02.972,And now I have a little something for the love of my life.
00:53:04.222,00:53:05.766,Martha May...
00:53:07.225,00:53:11.480,please become Mrs. Augustus May Who.
00:53:18.487,00:53:21.115,Augustus?
00:53:21.115,00:53:27.872,"May Who: If you agree to be my wife, along with a lifetime supply of happiness, you'll also receive this."
00:53:30.374,00:53:33.544,It's a new car!
00:53:33.544,00:53:37.297,Generously provided by the taxpayers of Whoville!
00:53:39.175,00:53:41.217,"What do you say, Martha?"
00:53:41.217,00:53:44.596,You got 20 seconds on the clock.
00:53:46.431,00:53:48.017,W-well...
00:53:48.017,00:53:49.351,I...
00:53:51.687,00:53:55.482,These gifts are quite dazzling.
00:54:05.409,00:54:08.453,Of course they are.
00:54:08.453,00:54:10.706,"That's what it's all about, isn't it?"
00:54:10.706,00:54:14.710,That's what it's always been about!
00:54:14.710,00:54:17.046,Gifts.
00:54:17.046,00:54:18.463,Gifts.
00:54:18.463,00:54:20.049,"Gifts, gifts, gifts, gifts, gifts, gifts!"
00:54:20.049,00:54:24.095,You wanna know what happens to your gifts?
00:54:24.095,00:54:25.888,They all come to me.
00:54:25.888,00:54:27.305,In your garbage.
00:54:27.305,00:54:28.724,You see what I'm saying?
00:54:28.724,00:54:31.810,In your garbage!
00:54:31.810,00:54:37.858,I could hang myself with all the bad Christmas neckties I found at the dump!
00:54:37.858,00:54:39.651,And the avarice!
00:54:41.361,00:54:44.406,The avarice never ends!
00:54:44.406,00:54:46.033,I want golf clubs.
00:54:46.033,00:54:50.537,"I want a pony so I can ride it twice, get bored, and sell it to make glue!"
00:54:50.537,00:54:56.252,"Look, I don't want to make waves, but this whole Christmas season is..."
00:54:56.252,00:54:59.171,"stupid, stupid, stupid!"
00:54:59.171,00:55:02.091,"There is, however..."
00:55:02.091,00:55:03.884,one...
00:55:03.884,00:55:07.888,teeny tiny Christmas tradition...
00:55:07.888,00:55:13.936,I find quite meaningful.
00:55:18.565,00:55:20.025,Mistletoe.
00:55:20.025,00:55:22.903,"Now, pucker up and kiss it, Whoville!"
00:55:29.451,00:55:30.535,Aah!
00:55:30.535,00:55:32.913,Uh-oh...
00:55:32.913,00:55:34.915,fabulous!
00:55:37.584,00:55:38.794,"All right, your turn."
00:55:38.794,00:55:40.879,Go on. That's right.
00:55:40.879,00:55:42.173,Aah!
00:55:44.716,00:55:47.845,Hyaah!
00:55:47.845,00:55:49.180,- Let's go!
00:55:49.180,00:55:50.848,"Excuse me, old-timer."
00:55:52.099,00:55:53.809,Mind if I wet my whistle?
00:55:53.809,00:56:00.024,"Well, I-- That's my good stuff!"
00:56:08.282,00:56:09.908,"Grinch: Burn, baby!"
00:56:09.908,00:56:11.243,Burn!
00:56:20.418,00:56:21.670,Hee hee hee!
00:56:21.670,00:56:23.421,"Oh, wow..."
00:56:23.421,00:56:25.966,"Oh, the Whomanity!"
00:56:27.343,00:56:29.011,- Let's go. Come on!
00:56:27.343,00:56:30.428,"- No, wait-- Do something."
00:56:30.428,00:56:31.763,Right.
00:56:39.021,00:56:41.273,Calling all units!
00:56:45.069,00:56:46.362,Taxi!
00:56:48.613,00:56:51.407,"It's because I'm green, isn't it?"
00:56:55.246,00:56:56.538,Halt!
00:56:56.538,00:56:58.957,Eek!
00:56:58.957,00:57:01.501,"Evening, folks."
00:57:01.501,00:57:03.628,You might want to skooch over.
00:57:03.628,00:57:06.382,- Aah!
00:57:06.382,00:57:08.050,You did the right thing!
00:57:16.100,00:57:17.434,Outta the way!
00:57:19.103,00:57:20.354,Hey!
00:57:20.354,00:57:22.398,Whoa!
00:57:22.398,00:57:24.649,Whee!
00:57:27.569,00:57:30.406,That's gonna hurt in the morning! Ha ha ha!
00:57:36.370,00:57:37.746,Whoa-ho-ho!
00:57:53.304,00:57:56.640,It's gonna blow!
00:58:04.481,00:58:06.650,Aaaah!
00:58:13.824,00:58:15.242,You fellas all right?
00:58:15.242,00:58:17.786,"Hey, how about a nice hat?"
00:58:17.786,00:58:19.121,Mayor: Lou?
00:58:28.297,00:58:30.507,"I'm hurt, Lou."
00:58:30.507,00:58:32.509,"I'm hurt, and I don't hurt easily."
00:58:32.509,00:58:36.180,But you and your...
00:58:36.180,00:58:38.723,I'm so...
00:58:38.723,00:58:40.558,so disappointed.
00:58:40.558,00:58:48.025,Can we just get back to Christmas the way it should be...
00:58:48.025,00:58:50.027,Grinch-less?
00:58:50.027,00:58:51.862,Merry Christmas!
00:58:51.862,00:58:53.405,Crowd: Merry Christmas!
00:58:53.405,00:58:55.699,Merry Christmas!
00:58:59.036,00:59:03.915,I just wanted everybody to be together for Christmas.
00:59:06.960,00:59:08.753,I quite enjoyed that.
00:59:08.753,00:59:11.089,I hope I get another invite soon.
00:59:15.844,00:59:17.221,"Mayor: Come on, come on, come on!"
00:59:17.221,00:59:19.515,Good thing we have a spare.
00:59:21.599,00:59:22.893,Sufferin'...
00:59:22.893,00:59:25.145,snorkelblatz!
00:59:25.145,00:59:27.731,They're relentless!
00:59:33.070,00:59:36.948,Only four hours till Christmas!
00:59:38.409,00:59:45.790,"Narrator: Yes, the Grinch knew, tomorrow, all the Who girls and boys would wake bright and early and rush for their toys."
00:59:45.790,00:59:49.086,"And then-- oh, the noise!"
00:59:49.086,00:59:53.549,"Oh, the noise, noise, noise, noise!"
00:59:53.549,01:00:02.558,"They'll bang on tong-tinglers, they'll blow their floo-flounders, they'll crash on jing-jinglers, and bounce on boing-bounders!"
01:00:02.558,01:00:06.270,Narrator: Then Whos young and old would sit down to a feast.
01:00:06.270,01:00:09.314,"And they'll feast, and they'll feast..."
01:00:09.314,01:00:13.235,"...and they'll feast, feast, feast, feast!"
01:00:13.235,01:00:20.033,They'll eat their Who pudding and rare Who roast beast!
01:00:20.033,01:00:24.121,Which is something I just cannot stand in the least.
01:00:24.121,01:00:30.127,"Oh, no-- I'm speaking in rhyme!"
01:00:30.127,01:00:31.462,Ugh!
01:00:34.631,01:00:38.343,"Blast you, Whos!"
01:00:42.306,01:00:49.313,"And the more the Grinch thought of what Christmas would bring, the more the Grinch thought..."
01:00:49.313,01:00:52.149,I must stop this whole thing.
01:00:53.567,01:00:57.779,"Why, for year after year, I've put up with it now."
01:00:57.779,01:01:00.491,I must stop this Christmas from coming!
01:01:00.491,01:01:02.576,But how?
01:01:00.491,01:01:05.287,Oh-- I mean-- in what way?
01:01:07.581,01:01:30.437,"Stereo: Are you having a holly, jolly Christmas?"
01:01:31.438,01:01:32.730,Wrong-o!
01:01:41.865,01:01:43.200,Hmpf!
01:01:50.790,01:01:54.711,"If you're not going to help me, then you might as well..."
01:01:56.046,01:02:00.425,"Then he got an idea, an awful idea."
01:02:01.510,01:02:06.431,The Grinch got a wonderful awful idea.
01:02:06.431,01:02:11.186,I know just what to do!
01:02:19.319,01:02:21.279,The Grinch laughed in his throat...
01:02:21.279,01:02:22.780,Ha.
01:02:22.780,01:02:25.867,...and he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
01:02:25.867,01:02:28.412,Ooh-hoo-hoo!
01:02:28.412,01:02:33.750,And he chuckled and clucked at this great Grinchy trick.
01:02:33.750,01:02:37.754,"With this coat and this hat, I'll look just like Saint Nick!"
01:02:37.754,01:02:39.548,Ho ho ho!
01:03:02.779,01:03:04.948,Whee!
01:03:44.154,01:03:47.824,"I asked for 3/4, not 5/8."
01:03:47.824,01:03:49.242,Stay focused!
01:04:16.144,01:04:17.646,Ow.
01:04:23.610,01:04:26.488,Air bag's a little slow.
01:04:28.573,01:04:31.493,But that's what these tests are for!
01:05:15.871,01:05:18.039,Santa: Ho ho ho!
01:05:18.039,01:05:22.502,Fat boy should be finishing up anytime now.
01:05:22.502,01:05:24.921,Talk about a recluse.
01:05:24.921,01:05:26.923,He only comes out once a year.
01:05:26.923,01:05:30.009,He never catches any flak for it!
01:05:30.009,01:05:33.430,Probably lives up there to avoid the taxes.
01:05:35.473,01:05:37.934,Merry Christmas!
01:05:39.686,01:05:41.062,Oopsie...
01:05:42.230,01:05:45.066,forgot about the reindeer.
01:05:45.066,01:05:48.528,Did that stop the old Grinch?
01:05:48.528,01:05:50.280,No.
01:05:50.280,01:05:52.532,The Grinch simply said...
01:05:52.532,01:05:55.993,If I can't find a reindeer...
01:05:55.993,01:05:59.956,I'll make one instead.
01:06:10.634,01:06:19.225,"So he called his dog Max, then he took some red thread and tied a big horn on top of his head."
01:06:20.268,01:06:21.603,Hee hee hee!
01:06:22.646,01:06:24.147,All right!
01:06:24.147,01:06:25.440,You're a reindeer.
01:06:25.440,01:06:30.320,"Here's your motivation: Your name's Rudolph, a freak with a red nose and nobody likes you."
01:06:30.320,01:06:33.657,"Then one day, Santa picks you, and you save Christmas."
01:06:35.617,01:06:38.202,"No, forget that part."
01:06:38.202,01:06:40.789,Just keep it kind of loosey-goosey.
01:06:40.789,01:06:42.081,You hate Christmas!
01:06:42.081,01:06:43.333,You're gonna steal it!
01:06:43.333,01:06:45.543,Saving Christmas is a lousy ending.
01:06:45.543,01:06:46.878,Way too commercial.
01:06:48.254,01:06:49.673,Action!
01:06:52.634,01:06:54.218,Brilliant!
01:06:54.218,01:06:58.890,You reject your own nose because it represents the glitter of commercialism!
01:06:58.890,01:07:00.851,Why didn't I think of that?
01:07:00.851,01:07:02.811,Cut! Print!
01:07:13.154,01:07:18.785,Tha-aat fee-eels go-ood...
01:07:24.666,01:07:26.250,Ha ha ha!
01:07:29.420,01:07:32.674,"Here goes nothing, hot dog!"
01:07:32.674,01:07:34.300,Hee-hee!
01:07:38.095,01:07:39.973,Wow.
01:07:44.143,01:07:46.980,Haah ha ha!
01:07:46.980,01:07:48.565,Hoo hoo hoo!
01:07:53.486,01:07:56.072,This is nuts!
01:07:57.741,01:08:00.076,"On, Crasher! On, Thrasher!"
01:08:00.076,01:08:08.543,"On, Vomit and Blitzkrieg-- Whoa-aaa!"
01:08:08.543,01:08:11.254,Whoa!
01:08:11.254,01:08:12.881,We're gonna die!
01:08:12.881,01:08:14.799,We're gonna die!
01:08:14.799,01:08:20.847,"I'm going to throw up, and then I'm gonna die!"
01:08:20.847,01:08:24.350,"Mommy, tell it to stop!"
01:08:24.350,01:08:25.810,- Waah!
01:08:38.698,01:08:40.700,Whew!
01:08:40.700,01:08:42.869,Ha!
01:08:42.869,01:08:45.622,Almost lost my cool there.
01:08:50.835,01:08:55.090,"All their windows were dark, quiet snow filled the air."
01:08:55.090,01:09:02.472,all the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care when he came to the first little house on the square.
01:09:02.472,01:09:05.182,"Welcome to Whoville, Max."
01:09:11.856,01:09:12.816,Betty?
01:09:12.816,01:09:13.858,Betty.
01:09:13.858,01:09:15.068,What?
01:09:15.068,01:09:16.360,Did you hear something?
01:09:18.780,01:09:20.364,It's Santa!
01:09:20.364,01:09:23.701,Go right back to sleep.
01:09:27.622,01:09:28.832,"Come on, Max."
01:09:28.832,01:09:31.167,It's our first stop.
01:09:31.167,01:09:33.586,...the old Grinchy Claus hissed.
01:09:33.586,01:09:36.464,"And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist."
01:09:36.464,01:09:43.387,"He'd slide down the chimney-- a rather tight pinch-- but if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch."
01:09:43.387,01:09:49.144,"He's planning a double twisting, interrupted four-flying two-and-a-half, with a combo tuck and pike."
01:09:49.144,01:09:50.520,High degree of difficulty.
01:09:53.940,01:09:55.733,Whoo!
01:09:57.110,01:09:58.987,Oof!
01:09:58.987,01:10:02.281,He got stuck only once for a moment or two.
01:10:02.281,01:10:03.825,Blasted water weight!
01:10:03.825,01:10:06.536,Goes right to my hips!
01:10:06.536,01:10:07.871,Unh!
01:10:11.457,01:10:13.417,Ow! Chee!
01:10:15.879,01:10:18.464,Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.
01:10:18.464,01:10:20.050,Shh!
01:10:20.050,01:10:22.385,"A little more stealth, please!"
01:10:22.385,01:10:24.971,...where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.
01:10:24.971,01:10:26.097,These stockings...
01:10:26.097,01:10:27.264,He grinned...
01:10:27.264,01:10:29.934,are the first thing to go.
01:10:29.934,01:10:31.394,"Okay, fellas..."
01:10:31.394,01:10:32.729,chow time.
01:11:02.842,01:11:04.094,Ha ha ha!
01:11:04.094,01:11:07.346,Then he slunk to the icebox.
01:11:07.346,01:11:08.681,Slunk?
01:11:10.975,01:11:13.728,He eyed the Whos' feast.
01:11:13.728,01:11:14.854,He took the Who pudding...
01:11:16.106,01:11:18.608,He took the roast beast.
01:11:18.608,01:11:20.651,Hike!
01:11:20.651,01:11:23.196,He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash!
01:11:23.196,01:11:27.408,"Why, that Grinch, he even took their last can of Who hash!"
01:11:28.659,01:11:32.705,Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee...
01:11:32.705,01:11:34.457,And now...
01:11:34.457,01:11:38.044,a...grinned the Grinch...
01:11:38.044,01:11:39.921,I'll stuff up the tree!
01:11:39.921,01:11:47.553,"And the Grinch grabbed the tree and he started to shove, when he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove."
01:11:47.553,01:11:48.846,Excuse me...
01:11:54.936,01:12:00.942,The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water.
01:12:00.942,01:12:04.988,"Santa Claus, what are you doing with our tree?"
01:12:04.988,01:12:08.950,"But you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick..."
01:12:10.618,01:12:14.038,"he thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick."
01:12:14.038,01:12:18.459,Why-- my sweet little tot...
01:12:18.459,01:12:20.628,...the fake Santa Claus lied...
01:12:20.628,01:12:27.384,There's a light on this tree that won't... light on one side.
01:12:27.384,01:12:31.014,"So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear."
01:12:31.014,01:12:32.015,Hee hee hee!
01:12:32.015,01:12:33.308,"Oh, ho ho ho!"
01:12:36.560,01:12:42.733,"I'll fix it up there, and I'll bring it back here."
01:12:44.527,01:12:46.821,"Santa, what's Christmas really about?"
01:12:46.821,01:12:48.156,Vengeance!
01:12:49.615,01:12:51.701,"Er, I mean..."
01:12:54.453,01:12:57.081,presents...
01:12:57.081,01:13:00.001,I suppose.
01:13:00.001,01:13:02.378,Hmm...
01:13:02.378,01:13:05.756,I was afraid of that.
01:13:05.756,01:13:09.135,And his fib fooled the child.
01:13:09.135,01:13:14.891,Then he patted her head and he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.
01:13:22.815,01:13:24.275,Santa?
01:13:24.275,01:13:25.526,What?
01:13:25.526,01:13:28.571,Don't forget the Grinch.
01:13:28.571,01:13:32.658,I know he's mean and hairy and smelly...
01:13:32.658,01:13:34.911,his hands might be cold and clammy...
01:13:36.495,01:13:38.831,but I think he's actually kind of...
01:13:38.831,01:13:40.499,sweet.
01:13:40.499,01:13:42.585,Sweet?
01:13:49.217,01:13:51.969,You think he's sweet?
01:13:51.969,01:13:53.888,"Merry Christmas, Santa."
01:13:53.888,01:13:56.557,Aiee...
01:14:00.770,01:14:03.189,And when Cindy Lou went up with her cup...
01:14:03.189,01:14:04.523,Nice kid.
01:14:06.317,01:14:10.113,Bad judge of character.
01:14:10.113,01:14:13.366,...he went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up.
01:14:20.998,01:14:24.377,And the last thing he took was the log for their fire.
01:14:24.377,01:14:28.381,On their walls he left nothing but some hooks and some wire.
01:14:28.381,01:14:34.845,And the one speck of food that he'd left in the house was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
01:14:37.890,01:14:45.982,"Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant around each Who home, and he took every present."
01:14:57.410,01:14:58.702,Clearance sale!
01:14:58.702,01:15:01.831,Everything must go.
01:15:10.298,01:15:11.715,Hmm...
01:15:13.384,01:15:15.928,What now?
01:15:49.920,01:15:51.088,Hee hee hee!
01:15:51.088,01:15:52.256,Martha...
01:15:52.256,01:15:57.220,have you ever kissed a man who lost his tonsils twice?
01:15:57.220,01:15:58.471,No...
01:15:58.471,01:15:59.680,silly!
01:16:03.309,01:16:07.271,But it's an experience that I've always longed for.
01:16:07.271,01:16:09.982,"Kiss me, you fool!"
01:16:47.895,01:16:49.146,Whoa!
01:17:30.687,01:17:31.897,Hm.
01:17:31.897,01:17:35.067,What are you laughing at...
01:17:35.067,01:17:37.736,Rudolph?
01:17:37.736,01:17:39.905,"It's all you, Maxie!"
01:17:39.905,01:17:47.246,"3,000 feet up, up the side of Mount Crumpet, he rode with his load to the tip-top..."
01:17:47.246,01:17:48.498,Hyah!
01:17:48.498,01:17:49.748,"Okay, whoa."
01:17:49.748,01:17:52.751,Whoa!
01:17:56.922,01:17:59.300,We...
01:17:59.300,01:18:01.969,did it!
01:18:05.264,01:18:07.975,We did it! We did it!
01:18:07.975,01:18:10.394,"That wasn't so bad, was it, Max?"
01:18:13.730,01:18:15.983,They'll be waking up now.
01:18:18.027,01:18:21.697,And I know just what they'll do.
01:18:22.615,01:18:30.581,All those Whos down in Whoville will all cry...
01:18:30.581,01:18:43.260,Who singer: Boo hoo!
01:18:47.223,01:18:48.432,What an embarrassment!
01:18:48.432,01:18:50.685,I've been robbed!
01:18:57.941,01:18:59.652,Whoa!
01:19:04.781,01:19:06.116,Ohh!
01:19:20.089,01:19:21.549,Mayor May Who?!
01:19:21.549,01:19:23.509,"Oh, dearest me!"
01:19:28.723,01:19:30.182,May Who: Well...
01:19:30.182,01:19:32.976,I wonder who could have done this.
01:19:34.729,01:19:38.065,Tell you people one thing: Invite the Grinch...
01:19:39.191,01:19:41.110,destroy Christmas.
01:19:41.110,01:19:46.240,"Invite the Grinch, destroy Christmas!"
01:19:49.201,01:19:51.621,But did anyone listen to me?
01:19:51.621,01:19:52.580,I did.
01:19:52.580,01:19:54.081,No.
01:19:54.081,01:20:05.551,"You chose to listen-- to a little not-to-be-taken-seriously girl, who hasn't even grown into her nose yet."
01:20:07.386,01:20:12.558,"Cindy, I hope you're very proud of what you've done."
01:20:21.191,01:20:23.402,"If she isn't, I am."
01:20:24.528,01:20:26.280,I'm glad he took our presents.
01:20:28.198,01:20:29.241,What?
01:20:29.241,01:20:31.118,I...
01:20:32.161,01:20:34.288,"Well, I'm-- I'm glad."
01:20:34.288,01:20:35.872,May Who: He's glad.
01:20:35.872,01:20:39.669,You're glad. You're glad everything is-- is gone.
01:20:39.669,01:20:47.217,"Ha ha! You're glad that the Grinch virtually wrecked-- no, no, not wrecked-- pulverized Christmas."
01:20:47.217,01:20:49.178,"Is that what I'm hearing from you, Lou?"
01:20:49.178,01:20:51.888,"You can't hurt Christmas, Mr. Mayor."
01:20:51.888,01:20:55.892,Because it isn't about the gifts or the contests or the fancy lights.
01:20:55.892,01:20:58.895,That's what Cindy's been trying to tell everyone.
01:21:00.230,01:21:01.898,And me.
01:21:01.898,01:21:05.068,What is wrong with you?
01:21:05.068,01:21:06.862,This is a child!
01:21:06.862,01:21:08.489,She's my child.
01:21:08.489,01:21:11.450,"And she happens to be right, by the way."
01:21:19.709,01:21:23.170,I don't need anything more for Christmas than this right here.
01:21:23.170,01:21:24.505,My family.
01:21:27.383,01:21:29.468,"Merry Christmas, everybody!"
01:21:29.468,01:21:31.679,Merry Christmas!
01:21:33.096,01:21:36.767,"Merry Christmas, you hunk of burning Who!"
01:21:43.733,01:21:46.360,"Oh, give me a break."
01:21:52.074,01:21:53.909,Merry Christmas.
01:21:53.909,01:21:55.202,Merry Christmas.
01:22:00.290,01:22:03.085,Whoa! Ha ha!
01:22:07.089,01:22:08.340,Mr. Grinch?
01:22:09.341,01:22:11.343,Mr. Grinch?
01:22:11.343,01:22:21.103,"Now for the final note in my symphony of downright nasty not-niceness, the crescendo of my odious opus!"
01:22:21.103,01:22:23.063,Yes!
01:22:26.191,01:22:30.237,"Oh, the wailing and the gnashing of teeth."
01:22:30.237,01:22:34.825,The bellowing of the bitterly bummed out!
01:22:34.825,01:22:38.871,It'll be like music to my ears!
01:22:46.545,01:22:51.133,Narrator: Then the Grinch heard a sound rising over the snow.
01:22:51.133,01:22:55.220,"It started in low, then it started to grow."
01:22:55.220,01:22:57.222,Huh? Huh?
01:22:57.222,01:23:00.225,But the sound wasn't sad.
01:23:00.225,01:23:04.313,"Why, this sounded merry."
01:23:04.313,01:23:06.440,But it was merry.
01:23:06.440,01:23:07.942,Very!
01:23:07.942,01:23:16.032,"Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small, was singing without any presents at all."
01:23:21.121,01:23:24.166,He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming.
01:23:24.166,01:23:25.542,It came.
01:23:25.542,01:23:29.296,Somehow or other it came just the same!
01:23:32.341,01:23:34.384,Mr. Grinch?
01:23:36.428,01:23:43.727,"And the Grinch, with his Grinch feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling."
01:23:43.727,01:23:46.355,How could it be so?
01:23:46.355,01:23:48.398,It came without ribbons.
01:23:48.398,01:23:51.193,It came without tags.
01:23:51.193,01:23:54.864,"It came without packages, boxes or bags!"
01:23:57.199,01:24:03.163,And he puzzled and puzzled till his puzzler was sore.
01:24:05.165,01:24:11.380,Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before.
01:24:11.380,01:24:14.008,Maybe...
01:24:14.008,01:24:15.133,Christmas...
01:24:15.133,01:24:16.593,he thought...
01:24:19.388,01:24:21.431,doesn't...
01:24:21.431,01:24:23.642,come from a store.
01:24:26.562,01:24:29.982,Maybe Christmas...
01:24:29.982,01:24:31.650,perhaps...
01:24:36.697,01:24:40.034,means a little bit more.
01:24:42.160,01:24:44.329,- Ow!
01:24:44.329,01:24:45.789,Aah!
01:24:45.789,01:24:47.374,Ow!
01:24:47.374,01:24:48.792,Oww!
01:24:48.792,01:24:50.252,Oww!
01:24:50.252,01:24:51.253,Ow! Ow!
01:24:51.253,01:24:53.129,Aah!
01:25:11.356,01:25:12.357,Max!
01:25:12.357,01:25:15.027,Help me!
01:25:15.027,01:25:17.279,I'm...
01:25:17.279,01:25:19.573,feeling!
01:25:25.704,01:25:38.174,"And what happened then-- well, in Whoville they say-- that the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day."
01:26:08.831,01:26:12.709,What's happening to me?
01:26:35.941,01:26:41.279,I'm all toasty inside.
01:26:47.243,01:26:50.413,And I'm leaking.
01:26:53.042,01:26:54.584,"Oh, Max."
01:26:57.129,01:26:59.965,I love you!
01:26:59.965,01:27:01.508,Yes.
01:27:01.508,01:27:02.926,Yeah!
01:27:07.305,01:27:09.474,"All right, that's enough."
01:27:09.474,01:27:11.476,Knock it off!
01:27:11.476,01:27:13.353,Now get out of here.
01:27:13.353,01:27:15.939,One step at a time.
01:27:20.443,01:27:21.653,Huh?
01:27:23.488,01:27:24.740,"Oh, no."
01:27:24.740,01:27:26.075,The sleigh.
01:27:26.075,01:27:28.577,The presents-- they'll be destroyed.
01:27:28.577,01:27:29.870,And I care!
01:27:29.870,01:27:33.749,What is the deal?
01:27:33.749,01:27:34.875,Wait!
01:27:36.459,01:27:37.920,This can't happen.
01:27:37.920,01:27:39.629,It shouldn't.
01:27:39.629,01:27:41.965,It mustn't.
01:27:41.965,01:27:44.509,"Not now, not then, not ever again!"
01:27:54.436,01:27:59.566,Noooo!
01:27:59.566,01:28:06.489,Yaaah!
01:28:36.478,01:28:40.232,Boo-hoo.
01:28:45.403,01:28:47.530,"Oh, well..."
01:28:47.530,01:28:50.284,"it's just toys, right?"
01:28:51.493,01:28:52.577,"Hi, Mr. Grinch."
01:28:54.830,01:28:56.748,Cindy Lou?!
01:28:56.748,01:28:59.626,What are you doing up there?
01:28:59.626,01:29:01.670,I came to see you.
01:29:01.670,01:29:04.547,No one should be alone on Christmas.
01:29:04.547,01:29:06.341,Ohh...
01:29:19.313,01:29:21.397,Unh! No!
01:29:21.397,01:29:22.858,Uhh...
01:29:52.595,01:29:55.765,"I got you, Cindy Lou!"
01:29:55.765,01:29:57.642,You did it!
01:30:14.492,01:30:15.702,Heh ha!
01:30:15.702,01:30:17.371,Hee hee hee!
01:30:18.580,01:30:22.084,Whoo!
01:30:22.084,01:30:23.210,Ha ha ha!
01:30:37.849,01:30:40.269,Whoa! Spread eagle!
01:30:40.269,01:30:41.895,Nailed it!
01:30:45.774,01:30:48.193,Ha ha ha-- huh?
01:30:58.745,01:31:00.330,Are you all right?
01:31:01.248,01:31:02.791,Are you kidding?
01:31:02.791,01:31:04.418,The sun is bright and the powder's bitchin'!
01:31:04.418,01:31:07.296,Now scoot over!
01:31:15.137,01:31:17.055,I better slow this buggy down.
01:31:19.933,01:31:22.602,- Hm.
01:31:22.602,01:31:24.604,"Now, you listen to me, young lady."
01:31:24.604,01:31:30.402,"Even if we're horribly mangled, there'll be no sad faces on Christmas."
01:31:32.862,01:31:36.116,AAH!
01:31:41.704,01:31:43.206,What is it?
01:31:43.206,01:31:44.582,Cindy: Help!
01:31:44.582,01:31:45.583,Cindy!
