00:00:40.832,00:00:43.960,but I felt that I needed to fight to be who I was.
00:00:48.965,00:00:51.384,I like the way I look here. I like my hair.
00:01:04.439,00:01:07.317,it brings back the enormous energy of those days...
00:01:07.817,00:01:09.819,and the go-for-broke sense of them.
00:01:15.909,00:01:18.787,How did she convince all these women to take their clothes off?
00:01:27.295,00:01:29.297,We always said the personal is political.
00:01:31.341,00:01:39.015,The rise of the women's movement was just part of that kind of personification of we're taking our power.
00:01:44.687,00:01:52.278,"we had an opening in history and we all, like Nora in Ibsen's Doll House, we all left the house at the same moment."
00:02:12.257,00:02:13.216,"Come on, girl."
00:02:21.850,00:02:25.103,"Oh, it looks very beautiful."
00:02:26.938,00:02:28.064,All these...
00:02:28.148,00:02:30.191,beautiful women standing up.
00:02:35.697,00:02:38.491,asked if she could take a picture of me for her book.
00:02:40.618,00:02:47.250,She said she thought women looked different because of feminism and she wanted to see if that difference showed up in photographs.
00:02:48.543,00:03:02.473,"She started with the women she knew, artists, writers, activists, and gradually went to the streets of New York and L.A., and she found something more complex than political fervor, more basic than sexual identity."
00:03:02.932,00:03:08.479,She captured these women at a moment when they felt the freedom to be who they are.
00:03:12.317,00:03:21.117,this one hour when women And it's really personal. It's really personal.
00:03:25.038,00:03:31.169,"where women sit around and find themselves and express themselves, and they were not afraid."
00:03:35.381,00:03:38.718,No. I just wanted to get as much...
00:03:39.427,00:03:41.512,clarity as possible.
00:03:41.596,00:03:46.100,"I just wanted them to be in their innermost self, their core."
00:03:52.357,00:03:54.651,and we look at the culture then and now.
00:03:57.654,00:04:03.284,"But as the women look back at us, their eyes remind us that the challenge is still there."
00:04:08.414,00:04:12.752,"Whenever I look at a picture of myself, I never look how I thought I looked."
00:04:14.128,00:04:17.465,But this picture looks more like myself than most do.
00:04:18.341,00:04:19.801,Except for the skirt.
00:04:23.513,00:04:26.182,"It's interesting, this shot here, um..."
00:04:26.891,00:04:30.311,because I didn't like it of all the photographs.
00:04:31.145,00:04:32.689,It was a hard time.
00:04:32.772,00:04:37.652,I was working in my studio and just trying to stay in the moment.
00:04:39.070,00:04:46.286,I always made a dark room where I lived because I think as a mother I had to be there.
00:04:46.369,00:04:51.207,"Not that I was that great of a mother, ...you know?"
00:04:51.291,00:04:52.375,"I, uh..."
00:04:52.458,00:04:57.588,But I... That was something that I had to do and my oldest children were at that point...
00:04:57.672,00:05:01.676,were getting into their teens and it was really hard.
00:05:02.260,00:05:04.304,But now I love that picture...
00:05:05.179,00:05:13.354,"because I, you know, I look a little beaten up but I kinda like it, because I was beautiful and beauty was a commodity."
00:05:22.613,00:05:26.159,"When I was 14, I was an usherette at a theater in Detroit, the Avalon."
00:05:26.576,00:05:30.580,We were watching a movie one night and it was Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell.
00:05:37.128,00:05:39.964,and the wife was way ahead of the husband and she kept...
00:05:40.673,00:05:41.799,Come on. Let's go.
00:05:41.883,00:05:50.266,"You know? And he's dragging behind 'cause they're singing and jiggling and he just kept lagging back watching the screen and she said, Oh, come on, they don't have any talent anyway."
00:05:50.558,00:05:52.477,"And he said, They don't need any."
00:05:52.810,00:05:54.562,And that was epiphanous for me.
00:05:55.229,00:06:00.651,"Jane and I wrote about it and she expressed it this way, she said, I felt the embryonic, uh..."
00:06:01.027,00:06:16.918,"kicking of feminism, and I was teaching a full college load and had published two books and was finishing a third..."
00:06:17.627,00:06:25.676,"I asked to teach at a slightly different hour because I saw when I was getting sleepy, and the dean at my university..."
00:06:26.719,00:06:28.930,"he said to me, Well, look, you have to make up your mind."
00:06:29.013,00:06:30.807,You wanna be a professor or a mother?
00:06:31.015,00:06:33.017,"I said, Are you kidding me?"
00:06:33.684,00:06:36.187,Hah! That was an Aha moment.
00:06:47.115,00:06:48.491,"God, was I young?"
00:06:52.245,00:07:04.173,When I was in college I was a philosophy minor and I took all these classes and I would raise my hand to ask a question and the male professors wouldn't call on me.
00:07:04.966,00:07:07.760,"And, you know, then they'd call on these guys."
00:07:08.136,00:07:10.805,"I'm like, They're not calling on me because I'm a girl."
00:07:10.888,00:07:14.517,I knew that but it was impossible to talk about.
00:07:15.184,00:07:26.946,"If I tried to raise it, people would say, What are you, some kind of suffragette? And of course, the image of suffragettes were these old dowdy ladies, you know, who'd made all this trouble."
00:07:27.029,00:07:33.161,"So, no, of course I didn't wanna be identified as a suffragette, just like these young women don't wanna be identified as a feminist."
00:07:47.717,00:07:50.052,It's contagious. It makes you wanna...
00:07:50.720,00:07:51.596,do you.
00:07:54.056,00:07:59.228,I always feel like when someone asks me if I'm a feminist that it's a trick question.
00:07:59.604,00:08:03.816,"Just amongst my friends, we don't use the word feminism that much."
00:08:04.108,00:08:14.160,"We tend to be a lot more specific. You know, like, We are fighting for gender equality or We're fighting for equal pay or We're fighting to get more women on-screen."
00:08:14.243,00:08:18.706,But we don't necessarily throw around the word feminist.
00:08:18.789,00:08:25.254,"In fact, of my friends, the only ones who are openly feminist and use that word are men, because it makes them look really cool."
00:08:34.931,00:08:38.643,and I was being helped by a man who was...
00:08:39.393,00:08:47.401,just there to help the customers and we got into a conversation somehow about gender issues. Somehow.
00:08:47.777,00:08:53.282,"And he asked me if I identified as a feminist, and I said yes."
00:08:53.741,00:08:57.286,And he just looked at me like I was a green monster.
00:08:57.370,00:09:00.915,Like I had then just affirmed that I hated him.
00:09:01.666,00:09:03.751,He was repulsed.
00:09:04.377,00:09:05.878,Repulsed.
00:09:35.783,00:09:41.038,"Equal rights. Equal rights to have a job, to have respect, to not be viewed as a piece of meat."
00:09:50.131,00:09:52.842,when you become the eunuch. It's always a man who's castrated.
00:09:52.925,00:09:56.887,"It's impossible to castrate a woman, at least as far as the definition is concerned in the dictionary."
00:09:59.682,00:10:01.517,...it's assumed that she has no sex.
00:10:02.268,00:10:05.062,"I mean, I didn't castrate women, Freud did."
00:10:06.480,00:10:14.864,"Every time you talk about an issue of feminism, you somehow have to have someone that's saying women are not human beings or wanting to be a human being is not ladylike."
00:10:20.786,00:10:24.540,Why are we so afraid to show our anger?
00:10:24.832,00:10:27.668,Why is anger considered not feminine?
00:10:29.712,00:10:46.228,"For better or worse there is not a situation in one's daily life that does not have feminist subtext, um, superstructure implications, and one is constantly aware that even when you want to rest it stands up and hits you in the face."
00:10:49.065,00:10:55.655,"This is a whole class of people oppressed for just millennium, suddenly, you know, like, breathing air and drinking in the light."
00:10:57.531,00:11:05.956,"Any kind of change, I mean, any healthy country, like any healthy individual, should be in perpetual revolution, perpetual change."
00:11:22.181,00:11:25.893,I was solitary a lot but I was never lonely.
00:11:26.894,00:11:28.688,I had a lot of imagination...
00:11:29.313,00:11:33.484,and there were a lot of oak trees on our property and I would climb to the top...
00:11:34.026,00:11:39.615,and I could see myself leading an army up the side of the hill like Joan of Arc.
00:11:39.699,00:11:42.451,That was one of my images of myself.
00:11:45.621,00:11:51.460,"Or I was the Lone Ranger, the masked bandit who would come and save people."
00:11:51.544,00:11:56.090,"Sometimes I wanted to be Tonto too, but always active and masculine."
00:11:59.468,00:12:01.095,The world of Suzy Homemaker.
00:12:03.305,00:12:06.183,"being a girl, being a woman, was the end."
00:12:06.267,00:12:11.731,"If you wanted to live and you wanted to have power and you wanted to succeed, you were a boy."
00:12:13.232,00:12:20.698,I really wanted an electric train set ...and my father didn't get them for me and I...
00:12:20.781,00:12:23.284,"Thinking back, maybe it was because I was a girl."
00:12:23.617,00:12:31.751,"I remember inviting a boy from my class, Billy Young, to my house and my mother said, You have to let him win all the games that you play..."
00:12:32.460,00:12:34.420,because girls don't win.
00:12:34.795,00:12:42.052,"And I remember thinking, That is really strange and I don't think it's fair at all and I'm not going to follow that at all."
00:12:47.433,00:12:49.268,"man, before puberty sets in."
00:12:51.771,00:12:56.650,And it's when the specter of womanhood begins to loom on the horizon...
00:12:57.651,00:13:01.405,"you have to stuff anger... you know, you have to be a good girl."
00:13:01.739,00:13:04.575,"Well, all your life, you know, people are saying, Be a good girl."
00:13:04.658,00:13:06.410,"Well, that implies that you're not..."
00:13:06.786,00:13:07.870,naturally good.
00:13:11.582,00:13:12.917,It's really nice.
00:13:14.627,00:13:18.672,There really is a power to being...
00:13:19.507,00:13:23.135,"female. I mean, it's... I don't know how to explain it but..."
00:13:23.219,00:13:25.221,you can see it in these images.
00:13:25.304,00:13:26.764,It's really kind of magical.
00:13:28.516,00:13:31.644,Fourteen for some reason was an age that just everything...
00:13:31.727,00:13:32.812,Everything shifted.
00:13:32.895,00:13:39.652,"I was constantly uncomfortable and sort of aware of what other people thought of me and, of course, that meant, like, boys."
00:13:40.861,00:13:43.113,All of the insecurities in the world happened.
00:13:44.240,00:13:46.200,"In some sense, before..."
00:13:46.283,00:13:48.994,that time I was more of a protagonist in my life.
00:13:49.078,00:13:53.165,"It's like your role as a girl is to, like, watch boys do stuff."
00:13:53.457,00:14:01.882,Suddenly you become aware that you're living sort of from the perspective of a male and... and reclaiming that I think is like... really hard.
00:14:09.682,00:14:11.559,secular Jewish household.
00:14:13.102,00:14:15.729,My parents believed in equal rights for women.
00:14:17.398,00:14:23.571,"For a woman of my generation I had a very unusual experience, which was I was really fathered."
00:14:24.738,00:14:35.499,"My father adored me, he encouraged me, he taught me, he played games with me, he trained me in logic and in values..."
00:14:36.166,00:14:41.714,and he taught me that I could trust a man.
00:14:42.798,00:14:45.259,My father was a labor organizer.
00:14:45.342,00:14:51.265,"He worked at the post office but his passion was change, making it a better world."
00:14:51.849,00:14:55.811,"And he was a victim of McCarthy which was, of course, in the '50s."
00:14:55.895,00:14:59.440,The FBI visited my house when I was six years old.
00:14:59.773,00:15:03.068,My father was hounded out of his work...
00:15:04.111,00:15:09.241,fired from the post office and hounded out of the labor union.
00:15:09.825,00:15:13.954,And he went through a slow...
00:15:14.455,00:15:16.582,physical and emotional decline.
00:15:18.250,00:15:20.085,He died when I was 13.
00:15:21.170,00:15:28.928,Here I was faced with the fact that the world was telling me my father was a terrible person...
00:15:30.471,00:15:32.348,but that was not my experience.
00:15:32.431,00:15:36.393,My experience was of my father as a wonderful person.
00:15:37.019,00:15:47.321,And at 13 I had to make a choice between whether I would believe what the world said or whether I would believe my own experience.
00:16:01.168,00:16:02.503,My first memories...
00:16:03.087,00:16:07.967,are of the hospital in Japan where I had pneumonia.
00:16:08.759,00:16:11.136,They would take us for a walk...
00:16:12.763,00:16:14.890,"all the kids, down this big corridor..."
00:16:19.687,00:16:24.566,"and at the end of the corridor were people left from the bombing, the atomic bomb..."
00:16:25.484,00:16:26.610,getting treatment.
00:16:33.742,00:16:35.577,I still remember those people...
00:16:36.578,00:16:38.247,and that colored my whole life.
00:16:38.831,00:16:42.668,I never could understand how people could blow each other up.
00:16:49.758,00:16:52.094,Down with his exaggerated thunder!
00:16:52.177,00:16:53.887,You want to talk psychosis?
00:16:53.971,00:16:55.848,Down with the tyrant!
00:16:55.931,00:16:59.727,"Daggers, hysterical puritans, starved animals."
00:16:59.810,00:17:02.813,"You want to, you want to, You want to talk?"
00:17:03.439,00:17:04.773,You want to write?
00:17:04.857,00:17:09.570,This is the writing dance For all to see...
00:17:10.195,00:17:15.951,The whole picture of the decimated site The picture of charnel ground.
00:17:16.035,00:17:17.703,And the jackals came.
00:17:17.786,00:17:19.163,And the jackals came.
00:17:28.630,00:17:40.768,"Clutching your dog tag, hiding under your desk, hands over your head with these, you know, sirens going, there was some tremendous fear but also an idea. This does not make sense. What is this about?"
00:17:40.851,00:17:42.770,War I associated with men.
00:17:44.438,00:17:48.400,I often feel that was the point where I went to poetry.
00:18:30.234,00:18:32.152,I aspired to be non-aggressive.
00:18:32.236,00:18:36.782,I'm sure that I'm aggressive in some situations but I aspire to non-aggression.
00:18:37.157,00:18:39.159,"There is something very, um..."
00:18:40.702,00:18:43.956,essentially and really deeply non-aggressive about women.
00:18:44.248,00:18:46.416,"If you look around and see, um..."
00:18:47.626,00:18:51.171,"who's picking up the guns, for the most part it's not us."
00:18:55.592,00:19:00.889,"In my own experience and in my own life, women tend to be the peacemakers..."
00:19:01.348,00:19:04.852,"the ones who are going, You guys, you brothers, don't kill each other, okay?"
00:19:04.935,00:19:09.148,Don't kill each other. You know? They have to like maintain some stuff at the very basic family level.
00:19:09.356,00:19:12.317,"From that to other models of, um..."
00:19:13.026,00:19:21.368,"peacekeeping, I think you can, uh, uh, big statement, look to women to be the ones who are very skilled at that."
00:19:21.451,00:19:23.495,"Very, very skilled at understanding..."
00:19:24.246,00:19:34.965,"uh, networks and how things work, seeing things as not a big story line with a big, you know, narrative arc, but as a fabric that is bound together and is..."
00:19:35.048,00:19:38.343,You can't do anything without it affecting something else.
00:19:46.685,00:19:50.022,"I wasn't from a city, I was from a small village so I'm a village girl."
00:19:50.397,00:19:56.195,And I think that really has had a big impact in my life and how I see the world.
00:19:58.363,00:20:01.366,There was an elder who lived across the way from us...
00:20:02.201,00:20:08.957,"and before we could eat, my mother would say to my sister and I, You go take this food for Ms. Rice."
00:20:09.041,00:20:10.292,"And we would say, But, Mummy..."
00:20:10.918,00:20:13.795,"We're hungry, Mummy. Why can't we eat and take the food?"
00:20:13.879,00:20:18.008,"She would say, No. Before you eat, you take the food over to her."
00:20:18.091,00:20:20.594,And we kind of grumbled a bit and then we did it.
00:20:22.012,00:20:33.649,"And then when I was a lot older I realized the lesson that she was really teaching us in terms of looking out for others even though we had very little, of sharing what little we had."
00:20:35.525,00:20:43.325,Immigrating from that village to Brooklyn was like one of the most traumatic experiences in my life.
00:20:44.284,00:21:09.977,"We were living with my aunt who was a member of Brooklyn CORE, Congress of Racial Equality, and immediately, I think about two weeks after arriving from Barbados, we were out on the picket lines because there was a huge civil disobedience where black people were protesting the fact that they were building a medical center in Brooklyn, the Downstate Medical Center, and they weren't hiring black people."
00:21:11.019,00:21:13.563,We would take a little paper bag lunch...
00:21:14.231,00:21:17.025,and we would stand there and block the cement trucks.
00:21:18.235,00:21:20.654,"And that's how we'd spend our summers, so this..."
00:21:21.071,00:21:25.075,was my introduction from my village to the United States.
00:21:45.679,00:21:49.308,"My mother was a witch, my father was an atheist..."
00:21:50.100,00:21:54.855,"and from these two sources, my father was the one who recognized me."
00:21:55.314,00:22:09.161,"When I was three months old already, I was not yet christened, and on my mother's side my grandma and mother's older sister wanted to do that because that was like a Catholic thing to do, and Father said, No, no, don't..."
00:22:09.244,00:22:12.456,don't do that. When she grows up she finds her own religion.
00:22:15.542,00:22:21.882,"So my father had the sense about me that I will find my own religion, and you know where I found it? Right here in L.A."
00:22:23.050,00:22:37.731,"The balmy weather and the wonderful smells that the air got from blooming flowers, the jasmines and the orange trees, and the Goddess is very, very feelable and visible."
00:22:38.523,00:22:40.984,I didn't have a coven anywhere else but here...
00:22:41.651,00:22:49.826,"and this is where it became an activism, it became a spiritual, political activism and, to me, they were the same."
00:22:49.910,00:22:52.913,I felt that the oppression of women is rooted in religion.
00:22:57.751,00:23:05.926,"and this is consciousness raising. We say, Hey Church, if you really, really think of all human beings, you better start changing that image of..."
00:23:06.259,00:23:09.846,You see that thing? And God created woman in her own image.
00:23:24.861,00:23:31.952,"Cynthia wanted me to be the Reverend Sally Kirkland, um, and she said to me that she was just gonna do my torso..."
00:23:32.869,00:23:35.414,"and, uh, there I am."
00:23:36.289,00:23:37.457,Thinner than I am now.
00:23:41.670,00:23:51.638,"My mom, Sally Kirkland, Senior, she was the first person to hire an African-American at LIFE magazine, Gordon Parks, the photographer and then filmmaker."
00:23:51.888,00:23:57.018,"And Henry Luce was very upset and came to my mother and said, We can't do this. He's a negro."
00:23:57.102,00:24:00.063,"And my mother said, If you don't hire him, I quit."
00:24:01.481,00:24:04.401,My mother was extremely independent.
00:24:04.776,00:24:17.289,"It was hard not to inherit a feeling that I deserved equality, that I deserved to be paid the same as men and to have the same opportunities as an actor, as a painter."
00:24:18.039,00:24:22.836,I became a yoga teacher at a time where there were only men teaching.
00:24:22.919,00:24:29.092,"You know, so she taught me how to just go for what I wanted and not take no for an answer."
00:24:37.350,00:24:38.935,"outside Boulder, Colorado."
00:24:39.686,00:24:42.981,So I was a slightly misplaced New Yorker...
00:24:43.440,00:24:44.691,in this photograph.
00:24:49.362,00:24:55.410,"You know, I became the head of the Poetry Project, founded this school... You know, the Kerouac school."
00:24:57.204,00:25:02.459,"Allen couldn't be there full time, somebody had to, you know, really mind the store and take charge."
00:25:05.212,00:25:07.255,I think I was able to hold my own...
00:25:07.756,00:25:11.968,"with Allen, with Burroughs. It was, you know, not easy at first."
00:25:13.261,00:25:14.596,I wasn't intimidated.
00:25:15.847,00:25:17.849,At some point I felt I had to correct Allen.
00:25:17.933,00:25:20.644,"I mean, I had to... You know, he would say girls instead of women."
00:25:20.727,00:25:21.728,I mean...
00:25:21.811,00:25:26.233,"I don't know where this, you know, came from exactly but my mother was a real force."
00:25:26.733,00:25:33.949,She had a real vision for what it was to be a female artist and a fully liberated person in the world.
00:25:35.200,00:25:42.582,"One letter she's saying to me, Men can put love aside and get on with their work, they can be more compartmentalized."
00:25:42.666,00:25:47.796,Don't just fall into this fallacy about falling in love and giving it all up for love.
00:25:48.255,00:25:49.256,She was very afraid.
00:25:49.339,00:25:52.676,And this was in my last year of college she was writing me these kinds of letters.
00:25:53.260,00:25:56.555,I had to please her. I had to do the work that she couldn't do.
00:25:58.348,00:25:59.724,I had a mother who was...
00:26:02.143,00:26:05.605,"Well, at least her discourse was like very, very feminist."
00:26:05.689,00:26:10.860,"Something that she said my whole life was, Les femmes ont le pouvoir, which means Women have the power."
00:26:10.944,00:26:14.364,"She really raised my sister and I to believe that, to live that."
00:26:14.447,00:26:17.576,"She would even, like, discourage my sister from having boyfriends for too long."
00:26:17.659,00:26:22.414,"It was like, You need to go have fun, uh, and be free and not be tied down to men."
00:26:22.497,00:26:28.670,"But at the same time, you know, she did grow up in France so she did have these pretty conservative ideas of, like, what women should be."
00:26:30.088,00:26:36.761,"The more my mother would tell me to be feminine and quiet and not funny or loud, the louder I would get and the more irreverent I would get."
00:26:43.727,00:26:47.689,"And one day, one of the little girls..."
00:26:48.189,00:26:49.190,tells me...
00:26:49.608,00:26:59.159,"Mind you, this is a little fifth grade girl, I just wanted to let you know that you can hang out with us if you lose a little bit of weight."
00:26:59.743,00:27:01.036,I remember...
00:27:02.412,00:27:07.208,"kind of feeling, like, resistance to that but feeling like, Okay..."
00:27:07.292,00:27:10.378,If that's what I need to do to fit in.
00:27:10.462,00:27:14.049,But I knew that it wasn't about my size.
00:27:15.383,00:27:38.782,"I remember I went home and I told my mom and I asked her about ways in which I could potentially lose weight and my mom told me, essentially, Anybody that does not see how phenomenal and beautiful you are and that does not value the fullness of you as you are, essentially does not deserve to share space and time with you."
00:27:38.865,00:27:41.451,And that instilled a dignity in me early on...
00:27:42.077,00:27:46.289,and it helped me navigate the world as a black woman.
00:28:02.055,00:28:08.395,"Well, it's really great because I was here in 1993 with my mother and that's when I wore this button."
00:28:08.812,00:28:17.779,"She's no longer here but we're representing her and it's just really, really nice, um, to be here with my daughter but it's very sad at the same."
00:28:17.862,00:28:30.542,"I'm just ashamed that I've lived through not being able to pass the ERA, I now have lived through not being able to get a woman president and, um, it just... I cry a lot still."
00:28:32.711,00:28:35.463,"It's like, Come on. It's 2017."
00:28:36.840,00:28:39.217,-I wanna be done fighting but you can't. -Yeah.
00:28:51.438,00:28:55.483,"If I'm gonna be a homemaker the rest of my life, I wanna know what I'm doing."
00:28:55.567,00:28:56.526,So do I.
00:28:56.609,00:29:02.157,What can they teach you in home ec class that you can't learn right here at home or pick up after you get married?
00:29:06.536,00:29:09.914,Because I had a brother who was 15 years younger...
00:29:10.498,00:29:15.712,"I brought in a demonstration of how to diaper a baby, and I got an A."
00:29:17.046,00:29:20.925,One of the things they taught us in home ec was how to cook.
00:29:21.384,00:29:22.552,I got an A in that.
00:29:23.052,00:29:26.973,And they also taught us how to wash dishes.
00:29:27.807,00:29:31.644,They gave us a chart: what to do first and what to do last.
00:29:32.520,00:29:35.356,It was home ec. We had to take it. All the girls had to take it.
00:29:40.987,00:29:43.990,I just had to see what pictures of me are in this book.
00:29:45.241,00:29:48.870,"Aw, look. I love this picture of me and Aloma."
00:29:51.080,00:29:51.998,And here I am...
00:29:53.041,00:29:56.419,on... my 1970 Mercedes...
00:29:57.462,00:29:58.797,which I still have.
00:30:03.510,00:30:09.432,I was thrown out of high school for forging absentee slips...
00:30:10.058,00:30:11.476,and I never went back.
00:30:11.810,00:30:13.770,That summer I went to San Francisco...
00:30:15.146,00:30:18.191,and that's when I turned into an adult.
00:30:27.742,00:30:30.703,because the Journeymen were playing the Hungry I...
00:30:31.287,00:30:35.959,and I just fell madly in love with the tall guitar player.
00:30:37.836,00:30:43.007,And we had my father come up from Los Angeles and John just begged him...
00:30:43.967,00:30:45.969,to let him take me to New York.
00:30:47.345,00:30:51.182,"And my father said, You know, she hasn't even finished high school."
00:30:51.266,00:30:52.350,And John said...
00:30:53.268,00:30:56.938,Gil... l'll teach her everything she has to know.
00:31:00.191,00:31:02.402,"And my father said, Yeah, I bet you will."
00:31:10.159,00:31:14.080,and the reason I'm in that outfit is I could not afford a winter coat.
00:31:15.248,00:31:17.500,I was a professor and making very little money.
00:31:23.798,00:31:27.427,I was in a male-dominated academic environment.
00:31:28.136,00:31:32.307,Other women my age have said the same thing: English departments were all men.
00:31:33.933,00:31:36.519,I didn't have any women professors.
00:31:40.106,00:31:41.941,I was not a liberated woman.
00:31:42.025,00:31:46.696,I had a boyfriend from high school that I followed through college.
00:31:47.196,00:31:51.784,So I was following a guy that I thought I would be spending my life with.
00:31:52.785,00:31:56.748,He didn't know how to make love so I had no experience sexually.
00:31:56.831,00:32:05.673,I didn't know what a clitoris was. I didn't ever experience gratification until I met someone who was like 26 or whatever in college.
00:32:06.215,00:32:09.636,It was actually my professor and I had an affair with him.
00:32:17.352,00:32:21.022,"And that was the end... That was the beginning of my, Oh, my God, you can have an orgasm."
00:32:21.689,00:32:23.483,It was a very big thing.
00:32:27.904,00:32:37.580,"When I met Abdul Kareem, and that's not his real name, we talked about Dostoyevsky and Proust and we were film buffs and opera buffs."
00:32:37.664,00:32:43.503,He promised a life of adventure and travel and I was lusting for that.
00:32:44.212,00:32:50.551,"He's the first man I slept with. I'm a nice Jewish girl, you're supposed to do right by the first man you sleep with."
00:32:51.302,00:32:52.136,So...
00:32:52.679,00:32:53.888,I brought him home.
00:32:54.806,00:32:58.017,I brought him home to impress my family. My family freaked out.
00:32:58.226,00:33:05.149,"He was the wrong religion, he was the wrong color, he was from the wrong country, nobody knew his family, you know?"
00:33:05.233,00:33:11.531,"And... in retrospect, if my family had been a bit more cool, I might have tired of him."
00:33:15.034,00:33:18.287,I believed that I would just meet his family.
00:33:18.746,00:33:19.956,He never told me...
00:33:20.832,00:33:24.794,that his father had three wives and 21 children.
00:33:24.877,00:33:25.837,Didn't mention it.
00:33:25.920,00:33:28.131,"Knew this guy for three years, didn't say it."
00:33:28.214,00:33:30.925,He didn't tell me I would be living with my mother-in-law.
00:33:32.927,00:33:34.303,When we land...
00:33:34.846,00:33:36.472,there's an official at the airport...
00:33:37.098,00:33:40.852,"who very smoothly says, Madam, we need your passport."
00:33:40.935,00:33:43.146,"I said, No, it's my American passport."
00:33:43.771,00:33:46.107,"And he said, Well, it's just a formality."
00:33:46.190,00:33:48.192,"You know, we'll send it to your home."
00:33:48.651,00:33:50.153,I never saw it again.
00:33:50.445,00:33:52.947,I instantly became the property...
00:33:53.489,00:33:58.745,"of a large, wealthy, polygamous Afghan family and the citizen of no country."
00:34:01.622,00:34:06.878,"From that moment on, I became a firebrand feminist."
00:34:06.961,00:34:13.134,Born in America but always with my eye on women's fate globally.
00:34:17.513,00:34:19.807,as the man who invented the new walk.
00:34:19.891,00:34:25.563,"With one hand he puts back the clock to the days of the hobble skirt and with the other, well, wait and see."
00:34:28.232,00:34:31.778,A few pins and the answer to What's his line? is A straight line.
00:34:32.528,00:34:34.989,The only thing is will Sheila be able to walk at all?
00:34:49.462,00:34:53.758,and actually was in hospital for periods of time...
00:34:54.383,00:35:04.102,"and what they would do in these hospitals, really, would be to retrain you to go back to what you were doing before. You know, to be a good girl, to be a housewife."
00:35:07.021,00:35:12.860,"and I wasn't getting the best grades and I remember my father saying, Oh, she's just gonna get married anyway. It doesn't matter."
00:35:13.820,00:35:15.988,And that still rings in my ears.
00:35:16.906,00:35:20.618,I felt that I had something else to do...
00:35:21.536,00:35:24.831,other than just get married and be Mrs. Somebody.
00:35:26.666,00:35:33.506,But I ended up putting a husband through medical school and I'd spent a lot of time alone.
00:35:35.091,00:35:37.885,I was getting more and more depressed...
00:35:38.427,00:35:41.139,and I kind of came to...
00:35:41.973,00:35:46.352,standing in our bedroom with a blanket over my head...
00:35:47.145,00:35:49.313,and I just said to myself...
00:35:50.398,00:35:51.524,This is not me.
00:35:52.108,00:35:54.569,I can't live like this. I have to do something.
00:35:58.823,00:36:02.368,there was one of these staged family picnics.
00:36:02.451,00:36:08.249,The only time we ever did stuff like that was if some photographs were being taken to show us as family.
00:36:08.332,00:36:10.126,All the dynamic is there.
00:36:10.209,00:36:13.754,I am hovering close to my father.
00:36:14.839,00:36:18.634,That was the start that would bring me to salvation.
00:36:20.178,00:36:27.727,"He was not paying attention to anybody, everybody was kind of separate, and my mother was leaning forward looking desperate."
00:36:28.686,00:36:31.647,"Well, of course, she killed herself five months later."
00:36:44.994,00:36:48.206,"you know, upset about some relationship thing and..."
00:36:48.623,00:36:53.628,"But also feeling... You know, sort of watching myself from above feeling like a total idiot and..."
00:36:53.711,00:37:01.010,"I had better things to do. My mother was right, No. Love is all there is."
00:37:12.647,00:37:13.773,to write Women and Madness?
00:37:13.856,00:37:15.733,"And I say, My whole life. It was my first book."
00:37:28.663,00:37:38.005,I had made headlines because I demanded a million dollars in reparations from the American Psychological Association on behalf of women who had been very badly treated.
00:37:38.965,00:37:43.594,"Publishers came calling, I was consumed by the ideas in this book."
00:37:44.637,00:37:46.097,It's never been out of print.
00:37:46.180,00:37:48.015,It's gone through many editions.
00:37:48.557,00:37:50.893,Feminists became therapists.
00:37:51.310,00:37:54.772,Women patients signed themselves out of mental hospitals.
00:37:54.855,00:37:56.816,"They wrote me letters, they told me."
00:37:56.899,00:37:59.443,They left abusive marriages.
00:37:59.527,00:38:04.824,"They began to think like Amazons, they said, because I used the Amazon myth."
00:38:05.783,00:38:11.289,"And it changed the profession by 10 percent, maybe by 15 percent."
00:38:11.372,00:38:14.333,That's not good enough for me but that is something.
00:38:21.132,00:38:22.883,to my two little boys...
00:38:23.884,00:38:27.680,"and after the second one I sort of thought, I replenished the Hungarians."
00:38:30.433,00:38:45.948,"...so I went to this church because I had to have community somewhere and... there was Father Taylor who I got to confess to and I told him, Yes, that I'm using contraception now."
00:38:46.907,00:38:50.328,"And he said, Well, I cannot forgive you then."
00:38:51.329,00:38:55.249,And I just thought about it a moment and it hit me that...
00:38:56.375,00:38:59.295,"I said, Father Taylor, you father of nothing."
00:38:59.378,00:39:01.589,You have not having any children.
00:39:01.964,00:39:07.553,"I just laid down my anger about, How dare you telling a woman what to do?"
00:39:08.054,00:39:11.932,"And that woke me up, how men tell women how to do babies."
00:39:28.407,00:39:31.452,you had to have the child. There were no options.
00:39:31.535,00:39:40.503,"And so when I was off on my own after I got away from that first husband, uh, literally, you know, I made a lot of mistakes."
00:39:41.712,00:39:54.225,"But I had no money, I got two abortions in Mexico, one here where I almost died, uh, with a balloon of something that they put inside of me."
00:39:54.308,00:39:56.644,But you were that desperate.
00:39:59.188,00:40:01.565,"Oh, all of them were before it was legal."
00:40:08.739,00:40:13.828,"Birth control rights were very, very important to me, because I went through an experience."
00:40:20.167,00:40:23.129,...how to make love but he knew how to get you pre...
00:40:23.212,00:40:27.466,So I used a diaphragm and I got pregnant in '67...
00:40:28.426,00:40:29.593,before it was legal.
00:40:30.428,00:40:34.223,Just word of mouth... found a psychiatrist...
00:40:35.057,00:40:36.308,"um, I could bribe."
00:40:36.392,00:40:37.977,"He told me what to say, you know."
00:40:38.060,00:40:41.147,He said They can only give you a psychiatric if you say you'll kill yourself.
00:40:41.230,00:40:43.232,"So I said, I'll kill myself. Okay. No problem."
00:40:44.733,00:40:49.697,"And then I went into, um, the thing and they said, You should be out in like a half hour."
00:40:50.281,00:40:55.202,I woke up two days later with IVs in my arm and I bled for two days straight.
00:40:56.370,00:41:03.711,"So I'm alive now, probably, because I went to a legal abortion in a hospital where they had transfusions."
00:41:08.215,00:41:11.677,leading a filibuster until the session runs out.
00:41:11.760,00:41:17.475,"Now, if it's passed, the bill would effectively shut down most abortion clinics in Texas."
00:41:21.645,00:41:25.357,"Our bodies, our lives, our right to decide."
00:41:25.774,00:41:30.237,And that's what is so scary about losing this right that we have.
00:41:30.529,00:41:33.491,Because women will do it.
00:41:34.116,00:41:35.910,It's the only power they have.
00:41:35.993,00:41:39.955,That it's hard for men to believe women should have the right to control...
00:41:40.039,00:41:40.998,their own bodies.
00:41:41.248,00:41:46.712,Mentally the right-wingers are doing that because they don't want women to have the freedom...
00:41:47.213,00:41:50.257,"and they have a magical thinking about sperm, I think."
00:41:59.725,00:42:04.647,Will you help me do the dishes?
00:42:05.064,00:42:08.442,Help you do the dishes?
00:42:09.693,00:42:15.157,"Well, they're your dishes as much as mine."
00:42:15.741,00:42:18.869,But you don't have a cock.
00:42:24.833,00:42:39.056,"After a decade of professional practice in Southern California, I got sick to death of trying to act like a man, paint like a man, you know, not be myself as a woman."
00:42:40.849,00:42:56.407,"The woman's movement was just starting, some of the radical feminist literature is coming out in New York and, of course, it's speaking to everything I'm feeling. You know, like, I was getting really pissed off by being told that I couldn't be a woman and an artist too."
00:42:56.490,00:43:03.289,"I was watching the men get, like, moved along on the choo-choo train of success and everything."
00:43:03.372,00:43:07.501,Every single instance of moving forward...
00:43:07.585,00:43:11.005,"Okay, I have a show, nothing would happen. I wouldn't sell anything."
00:43:14.842,00:43:26.604,"You couldn't really talk at that time about sexism, but I decided to start speaking out and I decided to create a feminist art practice."
00:43:28.814,00:43:31.317,If I help young women...
00:43:31.400,00:43:33.277,Younger than me. I was only 30.
00:43:33.360,00:43:34.737,But young women...
00:43:35.154,00:43:46.957,learn how to become professional artists without having to disconnect from their impulses as women maybe I can find my way back to my own voice.
00:44:19.490,00:44:25.329,Men were having the experience of seeing our point of view.
00:44:26.038,00:44:35.381,They were becoming an audience for the female gaze in the same way women have been the audience for the male gaze for centuries.
00:44:49.186,00:44:58.153,"And one of the things that had just happened for me is at the end of the first year of graduate school, they had a competition. First place was a thousand dollars..."
00:44:58.904,00:45:01.782,and they gave me first place and the ribbon...
00:45:02.908,00:45:04.868,and they gave me 500 dollars.
00:45:05.202,00:45:09.289,And they gave the two men who were second place 500 dollars each.
00:45:09.873,00:45:12.000,"I was like, Well, how can you do that?"
00:45:12.876,00:45:14.211,"Well, you know..."
00:45:14.712,00:45:19.133,they weren't as good as yours but they were as good as each other's.
00:45:20.592,00:45:22.261,So I told that story to Judy.
00:45:23.762,00:45:26.014,"She says, Nothing you can ever do..."
00:45:27.182,00:45:30.144,is going to make you one of those boys.
00:45:31.478,00:45:34.189,I became much less interested in...
00:45:34.773,00:45:43.449,pleasing the world or trying to get the world to acknowledge me and much more interested in how I could make a contribution that fulfilled me.
00:45:48.787,00:45:51.790,and so they handed the trophies to each director.
00:45:51.874,00:45:57.087,"And when they got to me, they handed it to my actor, who is a man."
00:45:57.171,00:46:05.512,"And then, after that, they ushered the actor onto the backdrop to take all the pictures and I just remember standing there like, Wow."
00:46:05.596,00:46:14.313,I had to push my way onto the backdrop to get in the picture and I felt really stupid as if I was making a big deal out of it.
00:46:14.396,00:46:17.399,"But it was a big deal. You know, I was the director."
00:46:21.653,00:46:28.494,"or does something that's sexist, ...like, laugh it off and like make the man feel comfortable."
00:46:28.577,00:46:29.745,It's just such a reflex.
00:46:29.995,00:46:32.915,"And then afterwards, I'll be like, Damn it, that was... I'm not a feminist."
00:46:32.998,00:46:34.792,That was not a feminist response.
00:46:34.875,00:46:37.544,"I should have really, you know, spoken my mind to that guy."
00:46:37.628,00:46:39.797,"But we're so conditioned to be like, Are you okay?"
00:46:39.880,00:46:43.717,"You know, like, I'll go bleed later but, like, how are you feeling?"
00:47:05.739,00:47:06.990,then I started reading Kate Millett...
00:47:08.158,00:47:09.868,reading a A Room of One's Own.
00:47:10.160,00:47:16.834,I just had this incredible sense of relief that what I had suffered and struggled with alone...
00:47:18.043,00:47:22.840,"somehow I realized that it was not my problem, that it was just more a social problem."
00:47:22.923,00:47:25.092,"And, I remember being in bed..."
00:47:25.175,00:47:31.139,"Like, you know, because I never have slept very well but I get a lot of ideas when I'm tossing and turning."
00:47:31.223,00:47:45.028,"And I remember thinking about, If the education of the girl child was the kind of education that told us that we have all possibilities, that there are no limits to our possibilities, then the world would be a better place."
00:48:08.093,00:48:14.850,I think that if there's an advance in half of the human race then that also helps the other half of the human race.
00:48:25.319,00:48:31.283,and there was a lot of organizing among the students of color and the faculty of color.
00:48:31.533,00:48:34.953,"You know, against racism and access and that sort of thing."
00:48:36.038,00:48:52.054,"We were working with some of the welfare mothers who had gone into City University under a special program to help bring in poor and minority students, and there were various problems, including the fact that the women needed childcare."
00:48:52.137,00:48:53.055,There wasn't any.
00:48:54.014,00:48:58.810,We went into the Women's Center and got space in the Women's Center.
00:48:58.894,00:49:01.438,Now that was frowned upon by the men...
00:49:02.731,00:49:03.565,who were...
00:49:03.649,00:49:09.571,"Considered themselves, you know, these third-world revolutionaries and academic heavies. It's like, Why are you going in?"
00:49:09.655,00:49:19.122,"You know, you're separating yourselves from the black community by going into the Women's Center? Because we know there are a bunch of white women over there and a bunch of them are lesbians, right?"
00:49:19.206,00:49:21.541,"And we were like, So what? We don't care."
00:49:21.875,00:49:30.384,"There was that tension and we had to make that fight to say that, yes, we are anti-racist and we are for women's rights."
00:49:30.968,00:49:43.355,"You have an asking of black women to silence their gendered experience for the sake of addressing racism. We have to look at race, we can't talk about anything else, and we can't divide the troops."
00:49:46.692,00:49:54.908,"An ankh around his neck, a scent of Nag Champa smoke, he said, Queen sister, mother of the earth, black girl, let me treat you like Goddess."
00:49:54.992,00:49:58.078,Gender binaries are an illusion and patriarchy is a crook.
00:49:58.161,00:50:03.333,"It is our duty to fight like it is our duty to win, like..."
00:50:03.417,00:50:04.626,How much can we complain?
00:50:04.710,00:50:07.254,We had a black man in the White House. Look how much we've gained.
00:50:07.337,00:50:08.296,Who's really woke?
00:50:09.715,00:50:14.970,"As a black woman, it is oftentimes difficult..."
00:50:16.138,00:50:30.569,"to identify as a feminist because it's so stigmatized in our communities that the idea is that once you announce that you're a feminist, that you are against the black man, and it's just not true."
00:50:30.652,00:50:44.332,"And, really, the way that feminists in general are stigmatized as being against and anti-man, instead of acknowledging the complexity and fullness of being woman."
00:50:50.005,00:50:52.132,It was very different for women of color...
00:50:53.091,00:51:00.348,"it was very different for working-class women, and some of the strongest, smartest people I met were union women."
00:51:00.432,00:51:03.060,"We were sisters, yes. Sisterhood is powerful..."
00:51:03.852,00:51:08.732,but the sisters came from very different families and that had to be recognized.
00:51:21.411,00:51:24.289,The Ah-ha moment was discovering that I was a lesbian.
00:51:25.123,00:51:27.167,That this was...
00:51:28.043,00:51:30.462,a difference you had not expected...
00:51:31.963,00:51:34.591,and this was a despised difference.
00:51:34.674,00:51:36.009,Listen to me!
00:51:53.068,00:51:56.196,But I never knew what it was until all this happened.
00:51:56.279,00:51:57.697,"Stop it, Martha."
00:51:59.616,00:52:01.409,Stop this crazy talk!
00:52:01.910,00:52:03.453,This was bad.
00:52:04.663,00:52:06.331,This was bad.
00:52:06.915,00:52:08.250,I would feel...
00:52:08.792,00:52:12.587,closer to my girlfriends than they felt towards me...
00:52:13.547,00:52:15.090,and I didn't know what to do with that.
00:52:15.924,00:52:22.848,"And I remember one night, I got a hold of a Free Press and in the back of the Free Press were all these ads."
00:52:23.515,00:52:26.643,"And it said, Women's consciousness-raising groups."
00:52:27.144,00:52:28.812,And I took down the address.
00:52:29.312,00:52:32.357,"Actually, I think it even said, lesbian."
00:52:33.567,00:52:35.110,And I couldn't say the word.
00:52:40.365,00:52:43.910,And I remember going to that consciousness-raising group...
00:52:44.578,00:52:45.829,being petrified...
00:52:46.746,00:52:52.043,"sitting cross-legged on a couch, looking at everybody and trying to figure out, What does this all mean?"
00:52:53.044,00:52:55.797,And they talked. They just talked about feelings.
00:52:56.381,00:52:58.842,"I was like, Oh, they're just humans."
00:53:09.811,00:53:14.983,to come to Broadway for the first time or was on Broadway at that moment. That would be 1977.
00:53:15.609,00:53:19.362,Every time I see a yield sign on the highway I feel sexually threatened.
00:53:21.156,00:53:26.828,"I've actually seen a man walk up to four women sitting in a bar and say, Hey, what are you doing here all alone?"
00:53:31.791,00:53:35.170,"My brother and I both are gay, so my brother, uh..."
00:53:35.545,00:53:43.261,"he probably was treated less kindly than I was, uh, because he was somewhat effeminate as a boy."
00:53:43.345,00:53:59.027,"The '40s and the '50s were a very rough time, uh, gender-wise. I mean, I was a tomboy and I could run and jump on things and jump off roofs and, you know, my brother wasn't as rough and tumble as he should be, according to standards..."
00:54:00.320,00:54:02.489,"and he paid a big price for it, too."
00:54:10.413,00:54:14.376,I don't really identify with being aware of being gay so early in life...
00:54:14.834,00:54:18.672,but I was always aware that there was something different about me.
00:54:18.755,00:54:23.301,I had relationships with men and they did... did very little for me.
00:54:23.385,00:54:25.845,And these were men I really liked and was really close to.
00:54:26.179,00:54:29.224,Once I had been with a woman it all came clear to me...
00:54:30.892,00:54:32.894,but I never felt...
00:54:34.354,00:54:36.231,that something was wrong with me for it.
00:55:21.443,00:55:28.867,"and I'm juxtaposed across from a woman who is completely naked and I can see that I am naked too, but I..."
00:55:28.950,00:55:32.037,I don't actually see that when I look at the picture.
00:55:32.620,00:55:37.417,"I see my intensity with the violin, I see the purity of the moment."
00:55:42.005,00:55:45.133,was no longer reserved to pornography...
00:55:46.634,00:55:50.347,but the body was a source of pride... and of health.
00:55:51.431,00:55:53.350,The body was to be celebrated...
00:55:53.975,00:55:55.268,and to be enjoyed.
00:55:59.272,00:56:03.860,"I think that women should be proud of their bodies, no matter what they look like."
00:56:05.320,00:56:10.700,"Back then, you could get me to go out in Sheridan Square and take my clothes off, I'd think nothing of it."
00:56:19.250,00:56:22.670,"and there you are, hanging upside down, almost nude."
00:56:25.423,00:56:29.010,I was nude except that the titles were covering my tits and my...
00:56:38.520,00:56:42.607,"Yeah, it was pretty interesting, especially given the fact that I hate to be naked."
00:56:44.651,00:56:46.653,But Vadim had great imagination.
00:56:46.736,00:56:49.280,"And I thought, Well, this could..."
00:56:49.364,00:56:51.408,It could be a really funny way to open the movie.
00:56:51.491,00:57:00.291,But that's the least of the things that I did that I didn't really want to do I've only known for ten years that no is a complete sentence.
00:57:16.516,00:57:20.019,I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do less.
00:57:20.603,00:57:23.898,"But he said, Yeah, you're going to be in the new group."
00:57:25.233,00:57:26.651,"I said, But..."
00:57:27.152,00:57:28.945,I... I can't sing.
00:57:29.279,00:57:31.281,"He said, You sing just fine."
00:57:32.490,00:57:33.616,And that was that.
00:57:56.639,00:58:03.980,"When we started singing with Cass and Denny, ...every piece of material that we had."
00:58:13.239,00:58:17.327,"I was having a lot of fun, making a lot of money."
00:58:17.827,00:58:21.789,"I had equal pay, I had fame..."
00:58:24.167,00:58:26.753,I was very innocent.
00:58:27.587,00:58:31.549,"Actually, I was fired from the Mamas and the Papas..."
00:58:32.884,00:58:39.307,because I was having a relationship outside of my marriage.
00:58:40.433,00:58:44.103,"Um, he was too but, you know..."
00:58:44.854,00:58:47.565,I never thought that he could fire me.
00:58:48.149,00:58:49.275,That was a...
00:58:50.360,00:58:52.862,"moment for me, when I realized..."
00:58:53.821,00:58:55.573,that I was powerless...
00:58:56.491,00:58:58.535,without John.
00:59:19.722,00:59:22.725,and then I met very strong women connected to that.
00:59:23.810,00:59:27.605,The women were all starting to group together and do caucuses.
00:59:32.819,00:59:47.000,"It was like, there's the wave Women's strike for equality."
00:59:48.418,00:59:52.922,"Edie and Marge and I were there marching with 50,000 others down Fifth Avenue."
00:59:53.923,00:59:58.011,The Senate held ERA hearings for the first time since 1956.
00:59:59.429,01:00:01.180,We thought we were going to change it all.
01:00:01.264,01:00:05.143,I sailed into the second wave of feminism as if I was born for it.
01:00:06.728,01:00:21.200,"The fact that the leaders among us may have been strong-willed and rebellious and already bent on accomplishment with a ferocity, but women were no longer just competing one against the other for a man."
01:00:21.993,01:00:26.748,Women were now all part of a team fighting for all women's freedom.
01:00:28.916,01:00:30.918,We were now Amazons.
01:00:31.002,01:00:33.004,We were now sisters.
01:00:36.257,01:00:38.843,The power of our sisterhood.
01:00:43.264,01:00:46.392,And anything we said or did made the headlines.
01:00:50.563,01:00:54.859,"and that is the social, economic and political equality of the sexes."
01:00:55.318,01:01:02.617,"Now, therefore, we are in politics, you see, because the relationship between the sexes is in fact a political relationship."
01:01:05.119,01:01:08.164,Sisterhood is powerful! Join us now!
01:01:14.295,01:01:25.223,"that the women's liberation movement is a joke, vaguely connected with burning bras and getting in the men-only bars, I disabuse you of that notion."
01:01:25.640,01:01:30.478,It is about equal pay and equal opportunity in the job market.
01:01:39.946,01:01:48.454,"we wanted to win our body, we wanted to win the right to our voice, we wanted to get our bills passed in the legislature."
01:01:49.038,01:01:50.164,We wanted to get...
01:01:50.957,01:01:52.750,women behind the camera...
01:01:53.918,01:02:03.970,"we wanted to get our poems on the page... we wanted what Gloria and Leti and the others did, to set up our own magazines, and we wanted them to be successful."
01:02:05.513,01:02:07.390,We wanted to win.
01:02:08.516,01:02:20.069,"Now, thanks to the spirit of equality in the air and to the work of many of my more foresighted sisters, I no longer accept society's judgment that my group is second class."
01:02:27.994,01:02:41.215,"who came to Los Angeles, as a result of Judy Chicago, Arlene Raven and Sheila de Bretteville soliciting women to come and join this new program of feminist art."
01:02:42.133,01:02:47.054,"We all showed up having paid our tuition, and there was no school."
01:02:48.598,01:02:53.060,There was 34 women sitting on the floor in Sheila de Bretteville's house.
01:02:53.561,01:02:54.812,Women were shocked...
01:02:56.355,01:02:59.525,"and, you know, a lot of them were saying, Well, what am I paying for?"
01:03:00.735,01:03:03.070,Judy very succinctly said...
01:03:04.113,01:03:09.619,You're paying for the opportunity to do your art and get support for it.
01:03:10.620,01:03:13.372,You're paying for the opportunity to change the rest of your life.
01:03:14.290,01:03:17.168,You're paying for the opportunity to change the world.
01:03:18.002,01:03:19.420,We did have to build that...
01:03:20.087,01:03:21.547,we couldn't go rent that.
01:03:22.215,01:03:26.093,"It didn't come with the building, it came with the building of the building."
01:03:45.613,01:03:46.989,Women really benefited...
01:03:47.532,01:03:52.453,"from having a place where they could say what they wanted, build what they wanted..."
01:03:52.912,01:03:58.125,and be seen as strong and powerful and competent.
01:04:03.798,01:04:16.602,"In this world, we will not have our stories told, we will not have our stories preserved, we will not have our stories recognized until we have our institutions to pass on our culture."
01:04:17.645,01:04:20.022,Because that's what institutions do.
01:04:31.242,01:04:33.160,International Women's Year.
01:04:44.839,01:04:52.889,"has there been such a women's meeting in numbers, in preparation, in diversity, in long-range effect."
01:04:53.347,01:04:59.645,Let us celebrate womanhood and let us celebrate democracy and let us celebrate woman power.
01:04:59.729,01:05:06.277,This is the time that we will make women and men share equally in the greatness of America.
01:05:06.360,01:05:07.945,"Thank you very, very much."
01:05:14.452,01:05:18.122,U.S. Conference on Women held in Houston in 1977.
01:05:18.748,01:05:21.751,Women of color got together and ran a slate.
01:05:22.919,01:05:33.471,"We felt that the concerns of mothers on welfare of poverty, of the forced sterilization of women of color wasn't really getting a look in."
01:05:39.727,01:05:47.735,"opposing the forced sterilization of black, Native American and Puerto Rican women and my mic was shut off."
01:05:49.612,01:05:59.372,"We were told not to raise these issues because if we did, it would jeopardize choice, which we all supported choice, the right to abortion."
01:05:59.455,01:06:00.706,"You know, we all supported it."
01:06:02.124,01:06:05.795,"We were saying, No, you can't do that on our backs."
01:06:06.379,01:06:10.800,"Women are going into hospital, they come out and they're sterilized."
01:06:11.425,01:06:14.470,How the hell are we supposed to keep our mouth shut about that?
01:06:15.137,01:06:29.986,"We did ask that we not be segregated into minority women, on your own, that we wanted to be part of the mainstream of women and that we wanted to be included in every part of the plan that affected us."
01:06:35.241,01:06:47.503,but if you're not listening to the voices of the women of color and telling us that we have got to put our concerns and issues on the sideline for the greater good...
01:06:47.586,01:06:53.759,"That's part of what happened there and, unfortunately, it meant that some people fell into separatism."
01:06:54.176,01:06:58.222,"Oh, yeah, we can't have nothing to do with these white women 'cause they're gonna sell you down the river."
01:06:58.681,01:07:02.309,"So, where, then, do black women exist in this conversation?"
01:07:02.393,01:07:15.364,"If you can't talk about, within black spaces, you can't talk about your gender, and within women's spaces, you can't talk about your race, but you are both, equally, every day when you wake up, what, then, do you do?"
01:07:19.660,01:07:30.546,"because, at the end of the day, when you look at the abolitionist movement and you look at civil rights movements you saw that, of course, white women were there."
01:07:34.175,01:07:36.635,"Do you not believe the woman's place is in the home, right?"
01:07:36.719,01:07:39.764,Of course not. It's a very oppressive concept.
01:07:39.847,01:07:44.602,It's being used to oppress women and to make them think they're lucky to be slaves.
01:07:58.824,01:08:07.166,"Over the years, she had told me stories about what happened and how women were treated in large, especially in institutional offices, insurance companies, banks and so forth."
01:08:08.209,01:08:19.386,"We went to Cleveland to meet with all these secretaries and went around and the women all told their stories and then Colin Higgins asked them, Do any of you ever fantasize what you'd like to do to your boss?"
01:08:25.810,01:08:27.228,And that became the movie.
01:08:48.624,01:08:54.004,the anthem for the movement of secretaries and it was the biggest money maker that year.
01:08:55.214,01:08:57.883,And it was one of the most glorious experiences...
01:08:59.093,01:09:00.427,of my life.
01:09:14.024,01:09:19.822,"and then as soon as I became conscious of it, I started to notice it everywhere, more and more."
01:09:21.323,01:09:33.002,"I'm not a very aggressive person by nature and so wanting to pursue my career has taken me a lot of work, emotionally. You know, I've had to exercise muscles that I didn't naturally have."
01:09:33.085,01:09:38.841,"So, you know, being able to speak up for myself, be louder than the person next to me or be able to assert..."
01:09:39.341,01:09:40.968,my voice in the room.
01:09:41.051,01:09:48.475,"You know, those are things that I really had to learn the hard way because I really care about becoming a filmmaker."
01:10:13.500,01:10:19.590,"when I was being a housewife and raising children, that I would have something for myself."
01:10:20.216,01:10:26.263,I gradually realized and then I kept realizing that that was myself...
01:10:26.805,01:10:29.433,the violin had been myself from the beginning...
01:10:30.142,01:10:31.060,and...
01:10:32.061,01:10:33.312,And that I loved it.
01:10:34.813,01:10:36.607,I have a career now.
01:10:36.690,01:10:39.610,I have this amazing life.
01:10:47.660,01:10:49.411,And that picture of me...
01:10:50.037,01:10:54.333,is me beginning to listen to my inner voice.
01:11:06.595,01:11:16.730,"I had never written a check in my life, he cleaned out our bank accounts, I never received any child support and I never received any alimony."
01:11:17.481,01:11:21.485,"I had to fight for my money, money that I had already earned."
01:11:22.403,01:11:26.824,"I was going to have to take care of myself, of my life."
01:11:28.909,01:11:33.163,"I came to this moment where I said, Never again."
01:11:33.872,01:11:36.041,This will never happen to me again.
01:11:36.917,01:11:38.168,And it never did.
01:11:49.930,01:11:59.648,"that I did a number of pieces that I would call apocalyptic pieces, where I felt that the artist's role was to state the problem, to be kind of mirror of the society."
01:12:00.024,01:12:04.820,"So, then I... I thought, You know, I'd rather offer a kind of antidote."
01:12:26.467,01:12:31.138,"and that people do seem, as far as I can tell, people do seem to be inspired by that."
01:12:32.264,01:12:44.818,"I had the good fortune to perform in Damascus in 2009 with my ensemble, and I just love these people, I loved my students so much and I just loved the people that I met in Damascus, the Syrian people."
01:12:44.902,01:12:46.445,So utterly generous.
01:12:46.528,01:12:52.701,"I mean, I've gone to 50 countries in my life, but I think I will never forget that time in Damascus as long as I live."
01:12:53.369,01:12:58.749,"So, when the trouble started happening in Syria, I just was undone."
01:13:13.347,01:13:15.682,"We were all questioning, Why are we doing art?"
01:13:15.766,01:13:18.102,"I mean, what difference does this make in the world?"
01:13:19.686,01:13:22.564,I think that when you are doing something that you love...
01:13:23.440,01:13:30.406,it's like throwing a rock in the pool because that love is hitting the pool and then it starts radiating out...
01:13:31.031,01:13:37.037,"and so, when you're doing something that you love and sharing it with other human beings, you are doing something of benefit."
01:13:49.758,01:13:57.182,"that I've done, I've learned a lot of things about the audience and one is, never underestimate the audience and what they can do with things."
01:13:59.643,01:14:09.486,"I particularly found that in a work I did a few months ago called Habeas Corpus, in which my collaborator was Mohammed el Gharani, who was the youngest detainee at Guantanamo."
01:14:10.529,01:14:13.782,Most of the people in the United States know more about Al Qaeda than this guy.
01:14:13.866,01:14:24.835,"He's a kid who was studying computers at his uncle's school in Pakistan and for seven years, from the ages of 14-21, we tortured him and did... very bad things."
01:14:33.802,01:14:38.265,"looking at this, uh, statue, and we had a camera that connected..."
01:14:38.891,01:14:41.018,"New York to West Africa, where he was."
01:14:42.102,01:14:44.730,I did see a number of people who came up...
01:14:46.315,01:14:50.194,and made eye contact with this on the delay to Africa and went...
01:14:52.696,01:14:53.780,I'm sorry.
01:15:02.748,01:15:11.256,"and make them interesting and visible, um, because I think that, uh, when you become aware of the rules, it's easier to break them."
01:15:11.340,01:15:13.008,And... And to be free.
01:15:13.091,01:15:15.260,That's my main goal as an artist is freedom.
01:15:21.850,01:15:38.283,"There was this curator at the Museum of Modern Art, a good guy, and a curator at the Metropolitan Museum who talked about when they were in their respective positions, they were always trying to bring women's work to the acquisitions committee, and they did in fact make..."
01:15:38.367,01:15:42.204,"Have some successes, as long as the work was small."
01:16:26.456,01:16:28.917,Look at this garbage.
01:16:32.045,01:16:42.389,"I mean, three-dimensional ceramic art of 39 women's, uh, vaginal area, their genitalia served up on plates that requires a whole room."
01:16:42.806,01:16:46.518,"In order to display weird, sexual art."
01:16:46.602,01:16:48.854,"Thirty-six thousand, five hundred NEA money."
01:16:48.937,01:16:53.275,Thirty-nine elaborate place settings depicting female vaginas.
01:16:53.525,01:16:59.656,"I'm a poet and I do have trouble with this because it's not art, it is not art. It's pornography."
01:17:08.165,01:17:11.752,"for the first time, I visited my father's grave in Chicago..."
01:17:12.336,01:17:14.296,and I told him he had told me a lie.
01:17:14.379,01:17:17.674,That he had told me I could be myself and be loved.
01:17:23.263,01:17:43.283,"In the recent show in Spain, Why Not Judy Chicago?, the curator, Xabier Arakistain, his premise is that my career can be understood around two concepts: deficit and disobedience."
01:17:44.326,01:17:57.798,"That is, that as a young woman, I awoke to the deficit of information on women's history, woman's art, women's experiences in the cultural dialogue..."
01:17:58.340,01:18:00.676,and I wanted to change that.
01:18:01.134,01:18:07.224,"But in order to change it, I had to become disobedient."
01:18:07.808,01:18:10.727,"And he's right, I've been a very disobedient woman."
01:18:12.145,01:18:31.373,"If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights That feminism has a future is inevitable."
01:18:31.832,01:18:34.876,It has seized the imagination of the world.
01:18:34.960,01:18:36.920,Lift your head up!
01:18:37.003,01:18:38.839,Egyptian women don't get stripped!
01:18:43.510,01:18:45.387,who are asserting their rights.
01:18:46.638,01:18:52.602,"When you're discriminated against as a woman, when you're not allowed to go to school in a country because you're a woman..."
01:18:54.062,01:18:57.274,or when you're shot because you've gone to school...
01:18:58.859,01:19:01.945,then being a woman is a primary part of your identity.
01:19:02.529,01:19:04.281,What's going to get you killed?
01:19:08.160,01:19:12.748,were and they are afraid of books and pens.
01:19:12.831,01:19:15.333,The power of education frightens them.
01:19:16.835,01:19:22.716,"They are afraid of women, the power of the voice of women frightens them."
01:19:23.383,01:19:32.100,"Because there were and they are afraid of change, afraid of equality that we will bring into our society."
01:19:40.817,01:19:41.818,That's gorgeous.
01:19:49.868,01:19:51.620,It's like an audacity.
01:19:54.080,01:19:55.040,I get it.
01:19:56.458,01:19:57.292,I get it.
01:20:32.536,01:20:45.632,"As I have gotten older, I have come back to where I started as that feisty girl, who would climb to the top of the oak tree and lead armies up the hill and knew who she was, and would stand up to anything and never told a lie."
01:20:46.842,01:20:50.762,That part of a lot of girls goes way subterranean.
01:20:50.846,01:20:52.264,It's not that it disappears.
01:20:52.347,01:20:53.557,It doesn't get lost.
01:20:54.140,01:20:55.684,It goes underground.
01:20:55.767,01:20:57.686,And the goal of our lives...
01:20:58.520,01:21:00.480,is to bring her back up.
01:21:11.241,01:21:15.120,on how feminism has only moved the world a little ways.
01:21:15.203,01:21:16.371,Because I see it...
01:21:16.955,01:21:19.040,in the next generation already.
01:21:19.374,01:21:20.709,The men I know...
01:21:21.751,01:21:25.171,who were raised by single mothers are different men.
01:21:26.339,01:21:30.051,The young people who don't care what race someone is...
01:21:31.177,01:21:32.345,are different people...
01:21:33.346,01:21:35.015,and we contributed to that.
01:21:43.023,01:21:46.902,"In the feminist movement, you know, politically correct is a good thing."
01:21:47.235,01:21:52.616,"I didn't think it was fair to just open the door to every kind of, uh, you know..."
01:21:53.491,01:21:58.997,prejudice and stereotype and I just like to believe that there's something higher that we could be.
01:22:08.840,01:22:12.093,You know what? I'm done playing nice. I'm done going along with...
01:22:12.344,01:22:13.553,the way things are.
01:22:13.637,01:22:18.975,We're all uniting and we're building solidarity across these different struggles.
01:22:24.773,01:22:31.905,"we can't do that anymore, because that still, again, creates division, creates hierarchies. And that's what patriarchy does."
01:22:38.703,01:22:46.419,"Women are raped, women are denigrated, women are marginalized, even in this... The glorious country of Uncle Sam and the Statue of Liberty..."
01:22:47.295,01:22:54.094,there are still hard things about being a woman and that's why we still need a feminist movement and must have a feminist movement.
01:23:05.897,01:23:09.234,All of us gained from the fact that there was a women's movement.
01:23:11.027,01:23:19.285,"It's how are we moving forward, keeping our autonomy, but realizing also that we better find our way to each other."
01:23:19.369,01:23:25.625,We need each other because we are all on this planet and we are all in trouble right now.
