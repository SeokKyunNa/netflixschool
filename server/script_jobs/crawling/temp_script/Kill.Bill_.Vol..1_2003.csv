00:01:31.633,00:01:37.556,"You know, I'll bet I could fry an egg on your head right now."
00:01:38.765,00:01:40.058,If I wanted to.
00:01:42.477,00:01:58.368,"You know, Kiddo… I'd like to believe you're aware enough, even now, to know that there's nothing sadistic in my actions."
00:02:00.287,00:02:04.207,"Well, maybe towards those other jokers."
00:02:06.585,00:02:07.836,But not you.
00:02:11.673,00:02:12.924,"No, Kiddo."
00:02:13.383,00:02:23.685,At this moment… this is me at my most… masochistic.
00:02:24.061,00:05:47.430,"Bill, Sarah, I cannot believe you are early."
00:06:51.119,00:06:53.747,"What you gonna do now, huh? What you got?"
00:06:54.164,00:06:56.249,I got your ass! Remember that? Huh? Remember?
00:07:05.967,00:07:07.510,"Okay. Come on, bitch."
00:07:09.429,00:07:12.182,Come on. Bring it on.
00:07:52.013,00:07:53.264,"Mommy, I'm home."
00:07:53.348,00:07:54.432,"Hey, baby."
00:07:54.766,00:07:55.892,How was school?
00:07:58.603,00:08:01.648,"Mommy, what happened to you and the TV room?"
00:08:01.731,00:08:02.983,Oh.
00:08:03.817,00:08:08.363,That good-for-nothing dog of yours got his little ass in the living room and acted a damn fool.
00:08:08.655,00:08:09.906,"That's what happened, baby."
00:08:10.365,00:08:13.827,"-Barney did this? -Baby, now, you can't come in here."
00:08:13.952,00:08:17.288,"There's broken glass everywhere, and you could cut yourself."
00:08:23.461,00:08:26.131,This is an old friend of Mommy's I ain't seen in a long time.
00:08:27.298,00:08:28.383,"Hi, honey."
00:08:30.927,00:08:32.178,What's your name?
00:08:35.890,00:08:37.142,Her name is Nikki.
00:08:38.184,00:08:39.227,Nikki.
00:08:40.645,00:08:42.731,Such a pretty name for such a pretty girl.
00:08:45.150,00:08:46.443,"How old are you, Nikki?"
00:08:54.242,00:08:55.410,I'm four.
00:08:56.411,00:08:57.746,"Four years old, eh?"
00:08:59.289,00:09:02.876,"You know, I had a little girl once."
00:09:04.502,00:09:06.004,She'd be about four now.
00:09:10.175,00:09:14.763,"Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend got some grown-up talk to talk about."
00:09:15.138,00:09:16.389,So you can go in your room now.
00:09:16.514,00:09:20.226,And I want you to leave us alone till I tell you to come out. Okay?
00:09:22.854,00:09:23.897,Nikkia!
00:09:24.397,00:09:26.566,In your room. Now.
00:09:39.788,00:09:41.039,You want some coffee?
00:09:54.260,00:09:56.471,Her husband is Dr. Lawrence Bell.
00:09:56.930,00:10:01.976,"But back when we were acquainted four years ago, her name was Vernita Green."
00:10:02.060,00:10:04.521,Her code name was Copperhead.
00:10:04.687,00:10:06.439,"Mine, Black Mamba."
00:10:06.523,00:10:07.732,Do you have a towel?
00:10:14.072,00:10:15.115,Thanks.
00:10:15.490,00:10:17.158,"You still take cream and sugar, right?"
00:10:17.534,00:10:18.535,Yeah.
00:10:21.746,00:10:24.290,"So I suppose it's a little late for an apology, huh?"
00:10:24.457,00:10:26.209,You suppose correctly.
00:10:26.751,00:10:31.631,"Look, bitch, I need to know if you're gonna start any more shit around my baby girl."
00:10:31.881,00:10:33.550,You can relax for now.
00:10:35.260,00:10:38.054,"I'm not gonna murder you in front of your child, okay?"
00:10:40.431,00:10:43.685,That's being more rational than Bill led me to believe you were capable of.
00:10:44.060,00:10:47.272,"It's mercy, compassion, and forgiveness I lack."
00:10:48.398,00:10:49.774,Not rationality.
00:10:56.739,00:10:58.032,I know I fucked you over.
00:10:58.950,00:11:02.245,"I fucked you over bad. I wish to God I hadn't, but I did."
00:11:08.293,00:11:09.544,No.
00:11:09.752,00:11:18.720,"To get even, even-steven… I would have to kill you, go up to Nikki's room, kill her."
00:11:19.637,00:11:23.600,"Then wait for your husband, the good Dr. Bell, to come home, and kill him."
00:11:24.601,00:11:26.311,"That would be even, Vernita."
00:11:26.936,00:11:28.479,That'd be about square.
00:11:29.189,00:11:32.150,"Look, if I could go back in a machine, I would."
00:11:32.442,00:11:33.568,But I can't.
00:11:35.361,00:11:37.655,All I can tell you is that I'm a different person now.
00:11:38.573,00:11:40.116,"Oh, great."
00:11:41.409,00:11:47.040,"-I don't care. -Be that as it may, I know I don't deserve your mercy or your forgiveness."
00:11:47.457,00:11:51.294,"However, I beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter."
00:11:52.170,00:11:55.006,"Bitch, you can stop right there."
00:11:56.591,00:12:04.098,Just because I have no wish to murder you before the eyes of your daughter does not mean that parading her around in front of me is gonna inspire sympathy.
00:12:05.642,00:12:08.603,You and I have unfinished business.
00:12:08.895,00:12:16.527,"And not a goddamn fucking thing you've done in the subsequent four years, including getting knocked up, is gonna change that."
00:12:17.820,00:12:19.489,So when do we do this?
00:12:20.448,00:12:21.950,It all depends.
00:12:22.533,00:12:24.661,When do you want to die?
00:12:25.203,00:12:28.248,Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow?
00:12:28.331,00:12:29.582,"How about tonight, bitch?"
00:12:29.666,00:12:31.501,Splendid. Where?
00:12:32.001,00:12:35.880,There's a baseball diamond where I coach our little league about a mile from here.
00:12:36.297,00:12:41.636,"We meet there around 2:30 in the morning, dressed all in black, your hair in a black stocking."
00:12:42.553,00:12:44.222,And we have us a knife fight.
00:12:45.348,00:12:46.808,We won't be bothered.
00:12:47.558,00:13:06.577,"Now… Bill always said you were one of the best ladies he ever saw -with an edged weapon. -Fuck you, bitch."
00:13:07.036,00:13:09.122,I know he didn't qualify that shit.
00:13:09.622,00:13:12.709,"So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass, Black Mamba."
00:13:14.294,00:13:15.586,Black Mamba.
00:13:16.296,00:13:18.423,I should have been motherfucking Black Mamba.
00:13:19.090,00:13:20.341,Weapon of choice?
00:13:20.425,00:13:22.885,"Hey, if you want to stick with your butcher knife, that's fine with me."
00:13:24.679,00:13:25.763,"Very funny, bitch."
00:14:26.532,00:14:29.077,It was not my intention to do this in front of you.
00:14:31.913,00:14:33.373,"For that, I'm sorry."
00:14:35.333,00:14:37.043,But you can take my word for it.
00:14:40.588,00:14:42.590,Your mother had it coming.
00:14:57.897,00:15:09.367,When you grow up… if you still feel raw about it… I'll be waiting.
00:15:16.958,00:15:24.549,when engaged in combat the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the warrior's only concern.
00:15:26.759,00:15:45.528,"Suppress all human emotion and compassion… kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be Lord God, or Buddha himself."
00:15:49.949,00:15:55.705,This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.
00:16:22.857,00:16:28.696,"This is rockabilly rhythms on KTRN, Wichita Falls. And next, we got some record."
00:16:28.988,00:16:31.782,"Very own wild man, Charlie Feathers."
00:17:07.401,00:17:12.240,"Well, give me the gory details, son number one."
00:17:12.323,00:17:14.325,"It's a goddamn massacre, Pop."
00:17:16.327,00:17:19.372,"They wiped out the whole wedding party, execution style."
00:17:22.208,00:17:23.626,Give me a figure.
00:17:23.709,00:17:25.044,Nine dead bodies.
00:17:25.753,00:17:27.713,And we're talking the whole shebang.
00:17:28.464,00:17:30.758,Bride. Groom.
00:17:31.342,00:17:32.552,Reverend.
00:17:33.219,00:17:34.428,Reverend's wife.
00:17:35.680,00:17:38.724,"Hell, they even shot that old colored fella that plays the organ."
00:17:40.017,00:17:44.146,It would appear to me somebody objected to this union and wasn't able to hold their peace.
00:17:49.485,00:17:52.405,"Good gravy, Marie."
00:17:58.786,00:18:00.663,"What'd I tell you, Pop?"
00:18:00.788,00:18:03.207,It's like a goddamn Nicaraguan death squad.
00:18:03.541,00:18:05.960,"You better shit-can that blasphemy, boy."
00:18:06.419,00:18:08.629,"-You're in a house of worship. -Sorry, Pop."
00:18:11.632,00:18:13.593,"Well, this is definitely the work of professionals."
00:18:14.385,00:18:17.847,I'd guesstimate Mexican mafia hit squad.
00:18:19.307,00:18:21.100,"Four, maybe five strong."
00:18:21.892,00:18:23.227,How can you tell?
00:18:24.020,00:18:26.355,"Well, a sure and steady hand did this."
00:18:28.274,00:18:30.151,This ain't no squirrelly amateur.
00:18:31.027,00:18:33.529,This is the work of a salty dog.
00:18:34.614,00:18:37.241,You can tell by the cleanliness of the carnage.
00:18:37.825,00:18:43.205,"Now, a kill-crazy rampage, though it may be, all the colors are kept inside the lines."
00:18:44.373,00:18:47.543,"If you was a moron, you could almost admire it."
00:18:59.930,00:19:01.182,Who's the bride?
00:19:03.684,00:19:07.396,The name on the marriage certificate is Arlene Machiavelli.
00:19:08.356,00:19:09.607,That's a fake.
00:19:10.358,00:19:13.486,We've all just been calling her The Bride on account of the dress.
00:19:16.656,00:19:21.285,Man would have to be a mad dog to shoot a goddamn good-looking gal like that in the head.
00:19:24.080,00:19:25.247,Look at her.
00:19:28.000,00:19:31.212,Hay-colored hair. Big eyes.
00:19:33.089,00:19:35.091,She's a little blood-spattered angel.
00:19:39.637,00:19:41.764,-Son number one? -Yeah?
00:19:42.723,00:19:46.227,This tall drink of cocksucker ain't dead.
00:22:21.966,00:22:23.926,I might never have liked you.
00:22:25.886,00:22:28.389,"Point in fact, I despise you."
00:22:30.432,00:22:33.602,But that shouldn't suggest that I don't respect you.
00:22:37.731,00:22:43.195,Dying in our sleep is a luxury that our kind is rarely afforded.
00:22:44.196,00:22:47.283,My gift to you.
00:22:54.164,00:22:55.541,For fuck's sake.
00:22:59.545,00:23:00.546,"Hello, Bill."
00:23:04.717,00:23:06.260,Comatose.
00:23:09.221,00:23:11.724,I'm standing over her right now.
00:23:22.943,00:23:24.528,"Oh, you don't owe her shit!"
00:23:37.666,00:23:39.293,And I put a bullet in her head.
00:23:39.501,00:23:41.795,But her heart just kept on beating.
00:23:43.047,00:23:48.594,"Now, you saw that yourself with your own beautiful blue eye, did you not?"
00:23:50.220,00:23:52.640,We've done a lot of things to this lady.
00:23:53.807,00:23:57.937,"And if she ever wakes up, we'll do a whole lot more."
00:23:59.271,00:24:08.614,But one thing we won't do is sneak into her room in the night like a filthy rat and kill her in her sleep.
00:24:09.782,00:24:16.789,And the reason we won't do that thing is because that thing would lower us.
00:24:17.915,00:24:19.667,"Don't you agree, Miss Driver?"
00:24:47.111,00:24:48.362,Bye-bye.
00:24:59.999,00:25:02.292,"Thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?"
00:25:05.754,00:25:08.090,"Word of advice, shithead."
00:25:08.841,00:25:10.634,Don't you ever wake up.
00:25:51.175,00:25:53.135,at my most masochistic.
00:26:58.784,00:27:01.078,"Oh, my baby."
00:27:30.023,00:27:31.316,Four years.
00:28:01.138,00:28:03.307,"The price is $75 a fuck, my friend."
00:28:03.849,00:28:05.267,You getting your freak on or what?
00:28:05.475,00:28:06.977,"Oh, yeah, boy."
00:28:16.695,00:28:18.655,Rule number one. No punching her.
00:28:18.822,00:28:22.326,"Nurse comes in tomorrow and she got her a shiner or less some teeth, jig's up."
00:28:22.534,00:28:24.912,So no knuckle sandwiches under no circumstances.
00:28:25.037,00:28:26.872,"And by the way, this little cunt's a spitter."
00:28:27.039,00:28:30.292,"It's a motor-reflex thing. But spit or no, no punching."
00:28:30.500,00:28:32.628,"Now, are we absolutely, positively clear on rule number one?"
00:28:32.753,00:28:35.214,"-Yeah. -Good. Now, rule number two."
00:28:35.505,00:28:39.051,"No monkey bites no hickeys. In fact, no leaving no marks of no kind."
00:28:39.676,00:28:42.221,"After that, it's all good, buddy."
00:28:43.138,00:28:44.973,"Now, her plumbing down there don't work no more."
00:28:45.057,00:28:46.767,So feel free to come in her all you want.
00:28:46.850,00:28:49.061,Keep the noise down. Try not to make a mess. I'll be back in 20.
00:28:51.313,00:28:52.648,Yeah.
00:28:52.731,00:28:53.774,"Oh, shit."
00:28:54.691,00:28:59.696,"By the way, not all the time, but sometimes this chick's cooch can get drier than a bucket of sand."
00:28:59.988,00:29:02.491,"If she dry, you just lube up with this and you'll be good to go."
00:29:04.534,00:29:05.994,"Bon appetite, good buddy."
00:29:15.671,00:29:18.215,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:20.509,00:29:21.551,"Oh, goddamn."
00:29:21.677,00:29:24.429,You are the best-looking girl I've had today.
00:30:13.145,00:30:15.397,"Yo, stud! Time's up, buddy."
00:30:15.897,00:30:17.274,"Coming in, ready or not."
00:30:17.441,00:30:19.568,"Hey, buddy, did you have yourself a good time, man?"
00:30:21.194,00:30:22.195,Whoa.
00:30:55.354,00:30:56.563,Where's Bill?
00:30:58.523,00:31:00.942,-Please stop hitting me. -Where's Bill?
00:31:13.497,00:31:16.583,"Well, ain't you the slice of cutie pie they said you was?"
00:31:17.334,00:31:19.795,"Jane Doe, huh? Oh, we don't know shit about you, do we?"
00:31:19.878,00:31:22.005,"Well, I'm from Huntsville, Texas."
00:31:22.339,00:31:25.759,"My name is Buck, and I'm here to fuck."
00:31:29.679,00:31:31.306,Your name is Buck.
00:31:32.432,00:31:33.642,Right?
00:31:34.476,00:31:36.812,And you came here to fuck.
00:31:37.604,00:31:40.148,-Right? -Wait a minute. Wait.
00:32:06.174,00:32:07.426,Pussy wagon.
00:32:08.552,00:32:10.095,You fucker.
00:32:37.873,00:32:40.292,Texas. Okay.
00:34:26.231,00:34:27.691,Wiggle your big toe.
00:34:33.113,00:34:34.614,Wiggle your big toe.
00:34:43.415,00:34:45.041,Wiggle your big toe.
00:34:51.548,00:34:53.091,Wiggle your big toe.
00:34:58.638,00:34:59.931,Wiggle your big toe.
00:35:00.348,00:35:06.896,"As I lay in the back of Buck's truck, trying to will my limbs out of entropy… Wiggle your big toe."
00:35:07.147,00:35:10.483,…I could see the faces of the cunts who did this to me.
00:35:11.109,00:35:13.445,And the dicks responsible.
00:35:15.447,00:35:20.660,Members all of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.
00:35:22.954,00:35:33.089,"When fortune smiles on something as violent and ugly as revenge, it seems proof like no other that not only does God exist, you're doing his will."
00:35:33.632,00:35:41.848,"At a time when I knew the least about my enemies, the first name on my death list, O-Ren Ishii, was the easiest to find."
00:35:42.390,00:35:50.065,"But, of course, when one manages the difficult task of becoming queen of the Tokyo underworld, one doesn't keep it a secret, does one?"

00:39:41.921,00:39:43.006,Mommy.
00:40:55.453,00:41:00.667,"Luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile."

00:41:20.186,00:41:22.146,Look at my eyes.
00:41:25.024,00:41:27.193,Look at my mouth.
00:41:27.860,00:41:29.821,Do I look familiar?
00:41:32.365,00:41:36.577,Do I look like somebody you murdered!
00:42:51.110,00:42:54.447,she was one of the top female assassins in the world.
00:43:44.956,00:43:53.506,"of nine innocent people, including my unborn daughter, in a small wedding chapel in El Paso, Texas."
00:43:54.590,00:44:01.013,"But on that day four years ago, she made one big mistake."
00:44:02.306,00:44:04.559,She should have killed ten.

00:45:54.669,00:45:56.629,My English very good.
00:45:57.630,00:46:00.549,You said domo. Can you speak Japanese?
00:46:00.967,00:46:04.262,No. No. Just a few words I learned since yesterday.
00:46:05.012,00:46:12.895,Um… Oh!
00:46:13.896,00:46:16.023,What other words did you learn?
00:46:16.983,00:46:19.026,Oh. Just a minute.
00:46:34.041,00:46:35.876,Why don't you serve it yourself for once?
00:46:40.339,00:46:41.716,Excuse me.
00:46:42.883,00:46:46.762,Uh-- uh-- uh… What other Japanese do you know?
00:46:47.930,00:46:50.850,Oh. Let's see. Arigato.
00:46:51.183,00:46:52.601,Arigato. Good!
00:46:53.686,00:46:57.690,"Um… Uh-- I already said domo, right?"

00:47:03.321,00:47:04.989,Kohn-nee-chee-wah.

00:47:06.824,00:47:08.034,Konnichiwa.
00:47:08.117,00:47:11.078,"Perfect. Good, good, good."

00:47:13.914,00:47:15.333,Now you're making fun of me!
00:47:15.416,00:47:17.960,"No, no, no. Serious business."
00:47:18.419,00:47:20.838,Pronunciation very good.
00:47:21.630,00:47:25.676,You say arigato like we say arigato.
00:47:29.013,00:47:36.020,"Well, thank you. I mean… You should learn Japanese."
00:47:36.604,00:47:37.813,Very easy.
00:47:42.860,00:47:44.945,But you have Japanese tongue.
00:48:01.379,00:48:02.713,"Hurry up, goddammit!"
00:48:17.561,00:48:19.021,I beg your pardon?
00:48:19.188,00:48:22.316,Uh-- uh-- uh… To drink.
00:48:22.608,00:48:25.736,"Oh, yes. A bottle of warm sake, please."
00:48:26.570,00:48:27.822,Warm sake?
00:48:28.197,00:48:30.032,Very good!
00:48:38.457,00:48:40.167,Get the sake! Get the sake!
00:48:40.334,00:48:42.670,How come I always have to get the sake?
00:48:42.795,00:48:47.633,"You listen well… For thirty years, you make the fish, I get the sake."
00:48:47.758,00:48:53.180,"If this were the military, I'd be General by now!"
00:48:53.431,00:48:56.100,"Oh, so you'd be General, huh?"
00:48:56.225,00:49:03.149,"If you were General, I'd be Emperor, and you'd still get the sake."
00:49:03.232,00:49:05.067,So shut up and get the sake.
00:49:20.499,00:49:21.667,-Mm-hmm. -Oh.
00:49:22.209,00:49:24.253,What brings you to Okinawa?
00:49:25.129,00:49:26.547,I came to see a man.
00:49:27.047,00:49:28.424,"Oh, yeah."
00:49:29.675,00:49:32.386,You have a friend live in Okinawa?
00:49:36.223,00:49:37.391,I never met him.
00:49:39.727,00:49:40.853,Who is he?
00:49:41.604,00:49:42.646,May I ask?
00:49:44.356,00:49:46.108,Hattori Hanzo.
00:51:56.780,00:51:57.865,May I?
00:51:58.907,00:51:59.992,You may.
00:52:03.746,00:52:04.788,Wait.
00:52:05.414,00:52:07.249,Try the second one down.
00:53:00.678,00:53:01.887,Funny.
00:53:02.846,00:53:10.437,You like samurai swords… I like baseball.
00:53:21.824,00:53:33.502,"However… someone as you, who knows so much, must surely know, I no longer make instruments of death."
00:53:34.670,00:53:42.720,"What I have here, I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value."
00:53:43.804,00:53:55.774,Yet proud as I am of my life's work… I have retired.
00:54:10.247,00:54:11.915,"I didn't say, Sell me."
00:54:12.541,00:54:14.126,"I said, Give me."
00:54:16.545,00:54:19.465,Why should I help you?
00:54:20.090,00:54:24.011,Because my vermin is a former student of yours.
00:54:27.431,00:54:35.397,"And considering the student, I'd say you have a rather large obligation."
00:55:34.540,00:55:37.960,It will take me a month to make the sword.
00:55:40.003,00:55:43.590,I suggest you spend it practicing.
00:57:17.601,00:57:27.110,"what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago… to never do again."
00:57:30.280,00:57:33.575,I have created something that kills people.
00:57:35.827,00:57:40.791,"And in that purpose, I was a success."
00:57:44.211,00:57:53.011,"I've done this because philosophically, I am sympathetic to your aim."
00:57:56.598,00:58:01.853,"I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword."
00:58:03.730,00:58:09.778,"If on your journey, you should encounter God, God will be cut."
00:58:22.416,00:58:25.711,Yellow-haired warrior… Go.
00:58:27.629,00:58:28.839,Domo.
00:58:52.571,00:59:05.584,"in El Paso, Texas, that Bill backed his Nippon progeny financially and philosophically in her Shakespearean-in-magnitude power struggle with the other yakuza clans over who would rule vice in the city of Tokyo."
00:59:06.835,00:59:16.595,"When the final sword was sheathed, it was O-Ren Ishii and her powerful posse, the Crazy 88, that proved the victor."
00:59:21.224,00:59:31.193,"who's dressed like she's a villain on Star Trek, is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend, and second lieutenant, the half-French, half-Japanese Sofie Fatale."
00:59:32.277,00:59:35.322,Another former protégée of Bill's.
00:59:40.202,00:59:44.956,"is O-Ren's personal bodyguard, 17-year-old Gogo Yubari."
00:59:45.707,00:59:51.254,"Gogo may be young, but what she lacks in age, she makes up for in madness."
01:00:09.356,01:00:10.774,Do you want to screw me?
01:00:12.275,01:00:15.612,"Don't laugh. Do you want to screw me, yes or no?"
01:00:17.030,01:00:18.240,Yes.
01:00:22.410,01:00:24.371,"How 'bout now, big boy?"
01:00:24.871,01:00:33.213,Do you still wish to penetrate me… or is it I who has penetrated you?
01:00:38.093,01:00:46.768,"The bald guy in the black suit and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo, the head general of O-Ren's personal army, the Crazy 88."
01:00:48.937,01:00:59.030,"And, just in case you were wondering, how could a half-breed Japanese-Chinese American become the boss of all bosses in Tokyo, Japan?"
01:01:00.073,01:01:01.449,I'll tell you.
01:01:01.700,01:01:11.418,"The subject of O-Ren's blood and nationality came up before the council only once, the night O-Ren assumed power over the crime council."
01:01:14.629,01:01:16.882,to break the mood is Boss Tanaka.
01:01:17.591,01:01:29.769,And what Boss Tanaka thinks is… This is a time for celebration!
01:01:34.441,01:01:36.484,The perversion of our illustrious council?
01:01:38.653,01:01:43.158,"Tanaka, have you gone mad? I will not tolerate this!"
01:01:43.241,01:01:45.493,You're disrespecting our sister. Apologize!
01:01:57.714,01:02:02.677,"My father, along with yours, and along with yours, started this council."
01:02:03.678,01:02:10.185,"And while you laugh like stupid donkeys, -they weep in the afterlife… -Shut up!"
01:02:11.144,01:02:12.979,…over the perversion committed today.
01:02:13.521,01:02:16.274,Outrageous!
01:02:16.775,01:02:20.195,"Tanaka, it is you who insults the council! Bastard!"
01:02:21.029,01:02:23.448,-Fuck face! -Gentlemen.
01:02:26.326,01:02:31.581,Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.
01:02:33.541,01:02:37.462,"By all means, allow him to express it."
01:02:38.672,01:02:54.521,"I speak, of the perversion done to this council, which I love, more than my own children, by making a Chinese Jap-American half-breed bitch its leader!"
01:03:40.150,01:03:45.905,"I encourage you from time to time, and always in a respectful manner, to question my logic."
01:03:46.448,01:03:52.787,"If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest, tell me so. But allow me to convince you."
01:03:52.871,01:03:57.792,"And I promise you, right here and now, no subject will ever be taboo."
01:03:58.835,01:04:01.504,"Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion."
01:04:04.591,01:04:12.891,"The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage as a negative is, I collect your fucking head."
01:04:13.600,01:04:15.518,Just like this fucker here.
01:04:18.063,01:04:25.236,"Now, if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!"
01:04:27.530,01:04:28.740,I didn't think so.
01:04:35.288,01:04:37.040,"One ticket to Tokyo, please."
01:07:12.862,01:07:13.780,Moshi moshi.
01:07:19.202,01:07:23.414,"Your wife is with you? Yes, I understand. Yes."
01:08:30.398,01:08:34.027,We've prepared special dishes for you.
01:08:37.030,01:08:41.618,Please come this way.
01:08:49.667,01:08:50.752,Hey!
01:08:53.212,01:08:54.339,"Hey, you!"
01:09:15.902,01:09:19.989,"So, in between the legs of the old guy, the face of an old lady appeared."
01:09:20.073,01:09:21.574,So here's the reason.
01:09:21.658,01:09:24.619,She saw the Johnson is pointing up straight.
01:09:33.878,01:09:34.962,Gogo.
01:11:04.469,01:11:05.470,Yeah!
01:11:05.553,01:11:06.763,Whoo!
01:11:52.141,01:11:54.894,-to any selfish demands they make. -They demand ridiculous things.
01:11:55.019,01:11:57.396,Shut up. Do you know what would happen if they heard you?
01:11:57.480,01:11:59.690,-What's gonna happen? -Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?
01:11:59.816,01:12:03.194,"-You're gonna get your head chopped off. -No, I don't want that."
01:12:55.997,01:12:59.584,"And if you give us a contact number, we will get back to you."
01:13:17.643,01:13:18.519,Oh!
01:13:21.522,01:13:24.191,"You're right, he does look like Charlie Brown."
01:13:24.275,01:13:27.194,"Charlie Brown, four pepperoni pizzas."
01:13:27.278,01:13:28.905,That's not on our menu.
01:13:28.988,01:13:32.116,"-I don't care, bring them, goddammit! -Bring them goddammit!"
01:13:32.199,01:13:35.077,"Hey, hey, Charlie, give me a kiss."
01:15:22.351,01:15:23.352,Miki.
01:17:16.715,01:17:19.135,any more subordinates for me to kill?
01:17:26.934,01:17:28.144,Bingo.
01:17:36.861,01:17:38.070,Don't they?
01:17:42.158,01:17:45.119,I know you feel you must protect your mistress.
01:17:46.328,01:17:50.249,But I beg you… walk away.
01:18:05.681,01:18:07.933,You can beg better than that.
01:21:22.378,01:21:23.796,Is that what I think it is?
01:21:24.254,01:21:26.632,"You didn't think it was gonna be that easy, did you?"
01:21:27.383,01:21:33.472,"You know, for a second there, yeah, I kind of did."
01:21:35.182,01:21:36.683,Silly rabbit.
01:21:37.768,01:21:39.436,-Trix are for-- -Kids.
01:28:08.700,01:28:12.579,This is what you get for fucking around with yakuzas!
01:28:13.538,01:28:14.790,Go home to your mother!
01:29:16.810,01:29:19.229,take them with you!
01:29:20.939,01:29:27.612,"However, leave the limbs you've lost."
01:29:28.905,01:29:31.700,They belong to me now.
01:29:40.333,01:29:43.169,You stay right where you are.
01:29:55.140,01:31:18.306,My place… I hope you've saved your energy.
01:31:22.185,01:31:27.565,If you haven't… you might not last five minutes.
01:31:29.526,01:31:34.406,"But as last looks go, you could do worse."
01:34:20.572,01:34:29.164,You may not be able to fight like a samurai… but you can at least die like a samurai.
01:36:04.884,01:36:06.511,I apologize.
01:37:20.668,01:37:22.503,Hattori Hanzo sword.
01:39:30.923,01:39:36.220,Sofie… My Sofie… I'm so sorry.
01:39:40.349,01:39:43.603,Please. Please forgive my betrayal.
01:39:45.813,01:39:57.992,But still… except my aching heart over what she's done to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie.
01:40:02.413,01:40:04.624,The first reason is information.
01:40:15.593,01:40:21.933,"And every time you don't give me answers, I'm gonna cut something off."
01:40:23.100,01:40:28.523,"And I promise you, they will be things you will miss!"
01:40:48.793,01:40:50.545,Guessing won't be necessary.
01:40:51.587,01:40:53.089,She informed me.
01:40:55.299,01:40:59.345,She said I could keep my wicked life for two reasons.
01:41:02.181,01:41:05.726,I've allowed you to keep your wicked life for two reasons.
01:41:06.769,01:41:14.610,"And the second reason is so you can tell him, in person, everything that happened here tonight."
01:41:16.112,01:41:21.826,I want him to witness the extent of my mercy by witnessing your deformed body.
01:41:23.202,01:41:26.789,I want you to tell him all the information you just told me.
01:41:27.415,01:41:29.875,I want him to know what I know.
01:41:30.543,01:41:33.629,I want him to know I want him to know.
01:41:34.714,01:41:42.513,And I want them all to know they'll all soon be as dead as O-Ren.
01:42:15.004,01:42:16.631,It's a forest.
01:42:18.132,01:42:25.056,"And like a forest, it's easy to lose your way, to get lost, to forget where you came in."
01:42:28.809,01:42:32.605,That woman deserves her revenge.
01:42:37.860,01:42:41.656,And… we deserve to die.
01:42:45.868,01:42:49.163,She must suffer to her last breath.
01:43:02.593,01:43:03.844,How did you find me?
01:43:14.814,01:43:18.150,Is she aware her daughter is still alive?
