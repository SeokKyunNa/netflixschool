00:00:35.577,00:00:38.497,Ball one to Johnny Damon and we are under way.
00:00:38.497,00:00:42.835,"Damon has eight hits in 18 at bats, a double, a triple, a couple of stolen bases."
00:00:42.835,00:00:45.004,He had four hits in the series opener.
00:00:46.296,00:00:47.965,Strike.
00:00:59.685,00:01:02.604,"Down the right-field line, fair off the bat of Damon."
00:01:02.604,00:01:05.733,It rolls by Spencer.
00:01:05.733,00:01:10.070,And Damon will coast into second base with a leadoff double.
00:01:14.241,00:01:17.870,"Into right-center field, broken bat, it'll fall, a base hit."
00:01:17.870,00:01:19.997,They wave around Damon.
00:01:19.997,00:01:25.669,And Jason Giambi delivers with a run-scoring single here in the opening inning.
00:01:25.669,00:01:28.296,And the Athletics have taken that 1-nothing lead.
00:01:28.296,00:01:30.298,"MAN: Go, come on. We gotta spin it."
00:01:36.597,00:01:39.725,"Let's go, Yankees!"
00:01:39.725,00:01:42.310,"Let's go, Yankees!"
00:01:42.310,00:01:44.939,"Let's go, Yankees!"
00:01:44.939,00:01:47.315,"Let's go, Yankees!"
00:01:47.315,00:01:49.234,ANNOUNCER 1: Bases loaded.
00:01:49.234,00:01:51.987,"The Yankees have the tying run at second, down 2-nothing."
00:01:58.368,00:02:01.663,The A's are kicking it and throwing it all over the field.
00:02:01.663,00:02:06.085,And it might lead to their elimination if they don't get it right in a hurry.
00:02:06.085,00:02:10.589,Hammered down the right-field line. Justice!
00:02:10.589,00:02:12.883,The Yankees have taken the lead.
00:02:18.472,00:02:24.686,"They're standing, anticipating another trip to the League Championship Series."
00:02:24.686,00:02:27.064,The Yankees one out away.
00:02:28.398,00:02:35.823,"ANNOUNCER 2: Eric Byrnes, never with an at bat in Yankee Stadium, and they don't get much bigger than this one."
00:02:35.823,00:02:39.576,Or more hectic when you're up there trying to get a job done.
00:03:01.765,00:03:04.977,And they're a strike away.
00:03:04.977,00:03:08.105,And they're roaring in the Bronx.
00:03:09.898,00:03:38.177,Losing the first two games at home in the best-of-five series and roar back to-- ANNOUNCER 1: The Yankees will defend their title.
00:03:48.687,00:03:59.322,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on."
00:03:59.322,00:04:02.117,I don't need to watch.
00:04:02.117,00:04:03.368,Okay.
00:04:12.335,00:04:18.133,Imagine how bad it'd be if you were a Yankee player and didn't like the taste of champagne.
00:04:19.342,00:04:20.844,Better ask to get traded.
00:04:20.844,00:04:26.266,You gotta give the Yankees-- --win the big game.
00:04:26.266,00:04:30.020,ANNOUNCER 1: What a series that is gonna be in the next...
00:04:37.736,00:04:41.115,You know how many kids are wearing Giambi's--?
00:04:41.115,00:04:44.034,Giambi's jerseys and hats and pictures and posters?
00:04:44.034,00:04:47.579,HOST: Those same kids will be booing in July when the Yankees come here.
00:04:47.579,00:04:51.792,Is it Giambi that's stabbing the back or the Pinstripes on the East Coast?
00:04:51.792,00:04:54.753,CALLER: You can't blame them for pilfering the henhouse.
00:04:54.753,00:04:57.422,The henhouse is there.
00:04:57.422,00:05:00.383,They're offering $120 million over six years.
00:05:00.383,00:05:04.721,The Yankees have deeper pockets and they're willing to give him money.
00:05:04.721,00:05:06.431,They're pilfering our players.
00:05:06.431,00:05:08.767,It's like we're a farm system for the Yankees.
00:05:15.607,00:05:18.193,How are the guys doing?
00:05:18.193,00:05:19.360,That was a killer.
00:05:19.360,00:05:21.280,It's a tough one to swallow. It's...
00:05:21.280,00:05:22.948,They played great.
00:05:22.948,00:05:25.826,They played their hearts out.
00:05:25.826,00:05:27.494,It just didn't fall our way.
00:05:27.494,00:05:29.079,You'll do better next year.
00:05:29.079,00:05:30.580,"But we were close, though."
00:05:30.580,00:05:32.874,We were so close.
00:05:32.874,00:05:35.418,Almost had it. You gotta feel good about that.
00:05:35.418,00:05:38.546,I feel great about it.
00:05:41.549,00:05:43.302,Um...
00:05:43.302,00:05:45.137,We're not gonna do better next year.
00:05:45.137,00:05:47.306,Why not?
00:05:47.306,00:05:48.849,You know we're being gutted.
00:05:48.849,00:05:53.979,"We're losing Giambi, Damon, Isringhausen."
00:05:53.979,00:05:56.731,Done deal.
00:05:56.731,00:05:57.983,You'll find new guys.
00:05:57.983,00:06:00.819,"You found Jason, you found Damon."
00:06:00.819,00:06:02.612,"I need more money, Steve."
00:06:02.612,00:06:04.990,I need more money.
00:06:04.990,00:06:07.742,I can't compete against $120 million with $38 million.
00:06:07.742,00:06:11.246,We're not gonna compete with these teams that have big budgets.
00:06:11.246,00:06:17.919,"We're gonna work within the constraints we have, and you're gonna do the best job that you can recruiting new players."
00:06:17.919,00:06:20.505,We're not gonna pay $17 million to players.
00:06:20.505,00:06:25.593,"I'm not asking you for 10 or 20, 30 million dollars."
00:06:25.593,00:06:27.595,I'm just asking for a bit of help.
00:06:27.595,00:06:31.390,Get me a little closer and I will get you that championship team.
00:06:31.390,00:06:33.434,"I mean, this is why I'm here."
00:06:33.434,00:06:35.896,This is why you hired me.
00:06:35.896,00:06:42.610,"And I gotta ask you, what are we doing here Billy, I-- if it's not to win a championship?"
00:06:42.610,00:06:46.656,I wanna win just as much-- That's my bar.
00:06:46.656,00:06:49.284,My bar is to take this team to the championship.
00:06:49.284,00:06:54.248,"Billy, we're a small-market team, and you're a small-market GM."
00:06:54.248,00:06:59.336,I'm asking you to be okay not spending money that I don't have.
00:06:59.336,00:07:11.472,"And I'm asking you to take a deep breath, shake off the loss, get back in a room with your guys, and figure out how to find replacements for the guys we lost with the money that we do have."
00:07:11.472,00:07:12.974,I'm not leaving here.
00:07:12.974,00:07:16.978,I'm not-- I can't leave here with that.
00:07:16.978,00:07:19.981,What else can I help you with?
00:07:31.159,00:07:34.204,"It's a good offer, and you gotta match it."
00:07:34.204,00:07:36.790,I need another day.
00:07:36.790,00:07:38.499,I just think you should know that.
00:07:39.834,00:07:41.461,I got a call.
00:07:41.461,00:07:42.921,I'll let him know.
00:07:42.921,00:07:44.631,Bye.
00:07:45.673,00:07:47.592,Yeah?
00:07:47.592,00:07:49.219,Just got off the phone with Dan.
00:07:49.219,00:07:50.304,You didn't.
00:07:50.304,00:07:51.930,I was surprised he called me.
00:07:51.930,00:07:55.475,Stop. I got Johnny for 7.5 or he doesn't play anywhere else.
00:07:55.475,00:07:56.810,That's the deal you made.
00:07:56.810,00:08:00.105,Boston just upped it to 7.75.
00:08:01.898,00:08:03.566,You there?
00:08:05.068,00:08:06.403,"We had a deal, Scott."
00:08:06.403,00:08:09.364,"We have a deal, if it's 8 million."
00:08:09.364,00:08:11.325,"Oh, man, you played me."
00:08:11.325,00:08:12.951,I'm just doing my job.
00:08:12.951,00:08:15.620,"No, you're playing me, and you're still playing me."
00:08:15.620,00:08:18.373,"Congratulations, asshole."
00:08:25.797,00:08:28.467,MAN 1: I like guys that got a little hair on their ass.
00:08:28.467,00:08:31.428,"MAN 2: He looks like a Mantle or a Mays, quite frankly."
00:08:31.428,00:08:34.264,He's got a baseball body.
00:08:34.264,00:08:36.391,MAN 3: I like Geronimo.
00:08:36.391,00:08:38.101,MAN 3: The guy's an athlete.
00:08:38.101,00:08:40.061,"Big, fast, talented."
00:08:40.061,00:08:42.272,Top of my list.
00:08:42.272,00:08:43.898,"Yeah, good jaw."
00:08:43.898,00:08:46.234,Good-looking ballplayer.
00:08:46.234,00:08:48.069,KEOUGH: He's got a beautiful swing.
00:08:48.069,00:08:49.529,The ball explodes off his bat.
00:08:49.529,00:08:55.076,"He throws the club head at the ball, and when he connects, he drives it, it pops off the bat."
00:08:55.076,00:08:56.953,You can hear it all over the ballpark.
00:08:56.953,00:08:58.663,PITTARO: A lot of pop.
00:08:58.663,00:09:00.915,"If he's good, why doesn't he hit good?"
00:09:00.915,00:09:03.168,KEOUGH: He is.
00:09:03.168,00:09:05.837,He's gonna be a good hitter against big-league arms?
00:09:05.837,00:09:07.964,KEOUGH: Could be great.
00:09:07.964,00:09:09.299,Kid needs at bats.
00:09:09.299,00:09:11.385,"Give him 400 at bats, he's gonna get better."
00:09:11.385,00:09:12.677,He can play.
00:09:12.677,00:09:14.929,GRADY: He's hit everywhere along the line.
00:09:14.929,00:09:16.806,BARRY: He's one of our guys.
00:09:22.437,00:09:24.272,"GRADY: Okay, let's move on."
00:09:24.272,00:09:26.358,"Artie, who do you like?"
00:09:26.358,00:09:28.902,I like Perez.
00:09:28.902,00:09:30.445,It's a real clean stroke.
00:09:30.445,00:09:32.489,I don't know.
00:09:32.489,00:09:36.201,"There's some work to be done, I'll admit that, but he's noticeable."
00:09:36.201,00:09:38.828,Got an ugly girlfriend.
00:09:38.828,00:09:42.165,KEOUGH: Means no confidence.
00:09:42.165,00:09:44.418,Artie is right.
00:09:44.418,00:09:46.711,An attitude is good.
00:09:44.418,00:09:49.756,"He walks in a room, his dick's already been there for two minutes."
00:09:49.756,00:09:51.966,He passes the eye-candy test.
00:09:51.966,00:09:54.969,He's ready to play the part. He just needs playing time.
00:09:54.969,00:09:57.680,"KEOUGH: I'm just saying, his girlfriend is a six at best."
00:09:57.680,00:10:01.101,"BARRY: If we're trying to replace Giambi, this guy could be it."
00:10:01.101,00:10:03.395,PITTARO: I agree with you.
00:10:05.272,00:10:07.941,"Damn, Billy, was that a suggestion?"
00:10:07.941,00:10:10.944,"Guys, you're just talking."
00:10:10.944,00:10:14.948,"Talking, la-la-la-la-la, like this is business as usual."
00:10:14.948,00:10:16.657,It's not.
00:10:16.657,00:10:19.327,We're trying to solve the problem.
00:10:19.327,00:10:21.913,Not like this. You're not looking at the problem.
00:10:21.913,00:10:24.207,GRADY: We're aware of the problem.
00:10:21.913,00:10:26.709,"I mean-- Okay, good."
00:10:30.922,00:10:34.217,"Look, Billy, we all understand what the problem is."
00:10:34.217,00:10:37.637,"We have to-- BILLY: Okay, good. What's the problem?"
00:10:37.637,00:10:40.348,We have to replace three key players in our lineup.
00:10:40.348,00:10:42.100,BILLY: Nope. What's the problem?
00:10:42.100,00:10:47.314,"PITTARO: We gotta replace these guys with what we have-- BILLY: No. What's the problem, Barry?"
00:10:47.314,00:10:49.983,"We need 38 home runs, 120 RBIs and 47 doubles to replace."
00:10:51.526,00:11:02.120,"The problem we're trying to solve is that there are rich teams and there are poor teams, then there's 50 feet of crap, and then there's us."
00:11:02.120,00:11:04.705,It's an unfair game.
00:11:07.792,00:11:09.628,And now we've been gutted.
00:11:09.628,00:11:11.963,We're like organ donors for the rich.
00:11:11.963,00:11:15.133,"Boston's taken our kidneys, Yankees have taken our heart."
00:11:15.133,00:11:21.806,And you guys sit around talking the same old good body nonsense like we're selling jeans.
00:11:21.806,00:11:24.267,Like we're looking for Fabio.
00:11:24.267,00:11:27.020,We got to think differently.
00:11:27.020,00:11:29.814,We are the last dog at the bowl.
00:11:29.814,00:11:32.025,You see what happens to the runt of the litter?
00:11:32.025,00:11:34.235,He dies.
00:11:34.235,00:11:40.783,"Billy, that's a very touching story and everything, but I think we're all very much aware of what we're facing."
00:11:40.783,00:11:43.828,You have a lot of experience and wisdom in this room.
00:11:43.828,00:11:48.124,You need to have a little faith and let us do the job of replacing Giambi.
00:11:48.124,00:11:50.335,Is there another first baseman like Giambi?
00:11:50.335,00:11:52.128,"ARTIE: No, not really."
00:11:52.128,00:11:53.712,"If there was, could we afford him?"
00:11:53.712,00:11:55.048,POTE: Nope.
00:11:55.048,00:11:59.135,"Then what the fuck are you talking about, man?"
00:11:59.135,00:12:05.392,"If we try to play like the Yankees in here, we will lose to the Yankees out there."
00:12:06.643,00:12:10.104,"Boy, that sounds like fortune-cookie wisdom to me, Billy."
00:12:10.104,00:12:11.690,"No, that's just logic."
00:12:11.690,00:12:13.358,Who's Fabio?
00:12:13.358,00:12:16.194,He's a shortstop.
00:12:16.194,00:12:18.905,"GRADY: Now, this is no time to push the panic button."
00:12:18.905,00:12:22.783,"Our scouts will find players, Player Development will develop them."
00:12:22.783,00:12:25.161,We'll teach them to play Oakland A baseball.
00:12:25.161,00:12:28.289,"With all due respect, we've been doing this a long time."
00:12:28.289,00:12:34.337,Why don't you just let us be responsible for replacing Giambi with who we know that can play?
00:12:48.602,00:12:51.979,MARTINEZ: Easy power.
00:12:51.979,00:12:53.648,SABATINI: Good face.
00:13:04.242,00:13:06.411,This son of a bitch is going in the first round.
00:13:08.037,00:13:09.997,"You're a premium player, Billy."
00:13:09.997,00:13:14.461,"You can run, you can field, you can throw, you can hit, you can hit with power."
00:13:14.461,00:13:16.504,That doesn't come along very often.
00:13:16.504,00:13:19.507,"SABATINI: This is Tom Martinez, national cross-checker."
00:13:19.507,00:13:21.842,MARTINEZ: How you doing?
00:13:21.842,00:13:26.805,It's been a while since I've seen a five-tool guy that can do everything.
00:13:26.805,00:13:34.230,I'm hopeful your interest in professional baseball is as strong as ours is gonna be in getting you in this upcoming draft.
00:13:40.737,00:13:43.323,WOMAN: Mr. Beane?
00:13:43.323,00:13:45.283,Mark is ready to see you now.
00:13:51.205,00:13:53.249,BILLY: How you doing?
00:13:53.249,00:13:54.668,How are you?
00:13:55.876,00:13:58.463,"Hey, Billy."
00:13:58.463,00:14:02.049,Good to see you. Sit down.
00:14:02.049,00:14:05.720,These are the guys.
00:14:05.720,00:14:06.971,How's it going?
00:14:06.971,00:14:08.306,All right.
00:14:08.306,00:14:10.475,You're filling out that chair nicely.
00:14:10.475,00:14:12.352,I got three weeks in it right now.
00:14:12.352,00:14:13.561,"Good, good, man."
00:14:13.561,00:14:15.271,"MARK: Yeah, man. How you doing?"
00:14:15.271,00:14:16.439,Fantastic.
00:14:16.439,00:14:18.274,Awesome.
00:14:18.274,00:14:20.901,That's good to hear.
00:14:20.901,00:14:23.237,You just tell me what you're looking for.
00:14:23.237,00:14:25.615,Fifty million dollars in additional payroll.
00:14:25.615,00:14:27.200,You should try Giambi.
00:14:27.200,00:14:29.202,Ouch.
00:14:29.202,00:14:31.496,I want this to be a friendly meeting.
00:14:31.496,00:14:33.206,It's not all on your shoulders.
00:14:33.206,00:14:35.625,Where's Steve in this?
00:14:35.625,00:14:37.711,He's supportive in rebuilding this team.
00:14:37.711,00:14:39.462,That's what we're gonna do.
00:14:39.462,00:14:41.339,"So, what are you looking for?"
00:14:41.339,00:14:42.965,A left-handed reliever.
00:14:42.965,00:14:45.593,I'm thinking Ricardo Rincon.
00:14:45.593,00:14:47.846,That's not gonna happen.
00:14:49.305,00:14:51.224,Not even a discussion?
00:14:51.224,00:14:56.646,"Billy, even if you could afford him, respectfully, we love him."
00:14:56.646,00:14:58.648,We're not about to let him go.
00:14:58.648,00:15:01.150,You got this Venezuelan kid coming up.
00:15:01.150,00:15:03.194,We had him.
00:15:03.194,00:15:05.822,Huh.
00:15:06.989,00:15:08.742,Outfielders.
00:15:08.742,00:15:11.661,To replace Damon?
00:15:11.661,00:15:14.288,In your price range?
00:15:14.288,00:15:15.665,"Enough, Mark."
00:15:15.665,00:15:18.042,Uh... Hollins?
00:15:18.042,00:15:20.670,BILLY: Uh-uh.
00:15:20.670,00:15:23.757,García?
00:15:23.757,00:15:26.175,Maybe Coste.
00:15:26.175,00:15:28.386,Uh-uh.
00:15:28.386,00:15:29.970,That's it.
00:15:31.347,00:15:33.224,"All right, tell me about García."
00:15:33.224,00:15:35.309,To replace Johnny Damon?
00:15:35.309,00:15:37.144,"Mark, is he healthy?"
00:15:37.144,00:15:38.479,"Yeah, he's healthy-ish."
00:15:38.479,00:15:41.107,He had that back thing.
00:15:41.107,00:15:42.776,He'll be ready for spring ball.
00:15:42.776,00:15:44.402,BILLY: I'll tell you what.
00:15:44.402,00:15:46.571,I can give you Guthrie if you kick in some cash.
00:15:46.571,00:15:47.947,Mark Guthrie?
00:15:47.947,00:15:50.157,How much cash?
00:16:06.382,00:16:08.885,MARK: Okay.
00:16:08.885,00:16:10.470,So García's gonna be a no.
00:16:10.470,00:16:13.598,"You're kidding me, right?"
00:16:13.598,00:16:16.058,You're kidding me.
00:16:17.727,00:16:21.940,"Okay. Straight up, García for Guthrie, no kicker."
00:16:21.940,00:16:24.567,No kicker?
00:16:27.987,00:16:33.743,"I think it's gonna be a hard no on García, but let's just keep going."
00:16:33.743,00:16:35.995,What are we doing?
00:16:35.995,00:16:38.456,MARK: This is the way we do business in Cleveland.
00:17:22.082,00:17:23.543,Hey.
00:17:24.752,00:17:27.296,Hello.
00:17:30.090,00:17:32.844,I'm Peter Brand.
00:17:32.844,00:17:36.180,What do you do?
00:17:36.180,00:17:38.850,I'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro.
00:17:38.850,00:17:40.727,"So, what do you do?"
00:17:43.103,00:17:46.774,Mostly player analysis right now.
00:17:46.774,00:17:50.570,Been on the job long?
00:17:51.905,00:17:54.448,It's my first job anywhere.
00:17:54.448,00:17:57.076,"Wow, congrats."
00:17:57.076,00:17:59.787,First job.
00:18:02.122,00:18:04.083,Why does Mark listen to you?
00:18:06.627,00:18:09.171,"I don't think, uh..."
00:18:09.171,00:18:11.632,I don't think he does very often.
00:18:12.926,00:18:14.844,He just did.
00:18:16.930,00:18:22.393,"Well, in that circumstance, I think he was more listening to Bruce than myself."
00:18:22.393,00:18:25.187,Mm-hm. Who are you?
00:18:27.857,00:18:30.234,I'm Peter Brand.
00:18:33.153,00:18:36.908,I don't give a rat's ass what your name is.
00:18:36.908,00:18:39.035,What happened in there?
00:18:40.160,00:18:42.956,What happened in that room?
00:18:42.956,00:18:45.792,"I'm not quite sure what you're asking me, Mr. Beane."
00:18:45.792,00:18:47.627,What did you tell Bruce?
00:18:49.378,00:18:51.297,I just told Bruce I like García.
00:18:51.297,00:18:53.967,You like García.
00:18:56.094,00:18:57.804,Why?
00:19:02.892,00:19:05.519,I don't know.
00:19:22.161,00:19:28.042,There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what is really happening.
00:19:28.042,00:19:36.676,And this leads people who run Major League Baseball teams to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams.
00:19:41.180,00:19:42.473,I apologize.
00:19:44.142,00:19:45.351,Go on.
00:19:48.521,00:19:54.276,"Okay. People who run ball clubs, they think in terms of buying players."
00:19:54.276,00:19:56.362,Your goal shouldn't be to buy players.
00:19:56.362,00:19:59.073,Your goal should be to buy wins.
00:19:59.073,00:20:02.576,"And in order to buy wins, you need to buy runs."
00:20:02.576,00:20:04.787,You're trying to replace Johnny Damon.
00:20:04.787,00:20:11.418,The Red Sox see Johnny Damon and they see a star who's worth $7.5 million a year.
00:20:11.418,00:20:16.090,"When I see Johnny Damon, what I see is..."
00:20:17.591,00:20:21.095,an imperfect understanding of where runs come from.
00:20:21.095,00:20:23.389,The guy's got a great glove.
00:20:23.389,00:20:26.642,He's a decent leadoff hitter.
00:20:26.642,00:20:31.355,But is he worth the $7.5 million a year that the Boston Red Sox are paying him?
00:20:31.355,00:20:33.357,No. No.
00:20:33.357,00:20:35.818,Baseball thinking is medieval.
00:20:35.818,00:20:38.612,They are asking all the wrong questions.
00:20:38.612,00:20:42.909,"And if I say it to anybody, I'm ostracized. I'm a leper."
00:20:42.909,00:20:48.039,So that's why I'm cagey about this with you.
00:20:48.039,00:20:58.465,"That's why-- I respect you, Mr. Beane, and if you want full disclosure, I think it's a good thing that you got Damon off your payroll."
00:20:58.465,00:21:03.096,I think it opens up all kinds of interesting possibilities.
00:21:03.096,00:21:04.597,"Where you from, Pete?"
00:21:04.597,00:21:06.390,Maryland.
00:21:06.390,00:21:07.975,Where'd you go to school?
00:21:07.975,00:21:09.852,Yale. I went to Yale.
00:21:09.852,00:21:11.562,What'd you study?
00:21:11.562,00:21:14.398,Economics.
00:21:14.398,00:21:16.859,I studied economics.
00:21:20.404,00:21:24.742,"Yale, economics and baseball."
00:21:26.368,00:21:28.537,"You're funny, Pete."
00:21:51.351,00:21:53.437,"DAD: Tell me, why Billy?"
00:21:53.437,00:21:55.982,What is it that makes him special?
00:21:55.982,00:22:04.991,"JONGEWAARD: Very rare do you come upon a young man like Billy who can run, who can field, who can throw, who can hit, and who can hit with power."
00:22:04.991,00:22:08.202,"Those five tools, you don't see that very often."
00:22:08.202,00:22:16.169,"MARTINEZ: Most of the youngsters that we have an interest in have one or two tools, and we're hoping to develop an extra one."
00:22:16.169,00:22:18.296,Your son has five.
00:22:18.296,00:22:22.508,We're looking at a guy that's a potential superstar for us in New York.
00:22:22.508,00:22:24.551,The time is now to get him started.
00:22:24.551,00:22:27.471,We're prepared to make a sizable financial commitment.
00:22:27.471,00:22:33.560,The Mets are gonna stand behind Billy because we expect him to be our big-league center fielder.
00:22:33.560,00:22:39.357,This check here represents the offer that the New York Mets would be making to Billy.
00:22:39.357,00:22:44.613,You do know that he's been accepted to Stanford on a full scholarship?
00:22:44.613,00:22:45.948,JONGEWAARD: I do.
00:22:45.948,00:22:48.575,So he can do both?
00:22:48.575,00:22:53.122,"Unfortunately, he can't do Stanford and professional baseball."
00:22:53.122,00:22:57.251,He would have to pick one or the other.
00:22:57.251,00:23:07.011,"If he wants to be center fielder for the Mets, wants to be a baseball player, he really needs to accept this as life's first occupation, first career."
00:23:07.011,00:23:10.890,We're all told at some point we can no longer play the children's game.
00:23:10.890,00:23:13.684,We just don't know when that's gonna be.
00:23:13.684,00:23:18.064,"Some of us are told at 18, some of us are told at 40, but we're all told."
00:23:18.064,00:23:21.984,But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
00:23:21.984,00:23:26.780,"We want you badly, and we think that this amount of money expresses that desire."
00:23:26.780,00:23:32.703,"DAD: Billy, this is your decision, and whatever that decision is, you know it's fine with your mother and I."
00:23:43.547,00:23:46.092,PETER: Hello?
00:23:46.092,00:23:48.677,"Hey, what time is it?"
00:23:48.677,00:23:51.471,I don't know.
00:23:51.471,00:23:55.642,"Listen, would you have drafted me in the first round?"
00:23:55.642,00:23:57.395,What?
00:23:57.395,00:24:01.148,"After I left, you looked me up on your computer."
00:24:01.148,00:24:03.441,Would you have drafted me in the first round?
00:24:03.441,00:24:06.695,"I did, yeah."
00:24:06.695,00:24:09.156,"Cut the crap, man."
00:24:09.156,00:24:12.618,Would you have drafted me in the first round?
00:24:12.618,00:24:14.745,I'd have taken you in the ninth round.
00:24:14.745,00:24:17.706,No signing bonus.
00:24:17.706,00:24:21.710,I imagine you would've passed and taken that scholarship.
00:24:22.795,00:24:24.755,Yeah.
00:24:28.342,00:24:31.137,"Pack your bags, Pete."
00:24:31.137,00:24:34.265,I just bought you from the Cleveland Indians.
00:24:48.070,00:24:50.030,MAN 1: Is it attached to that clamp?
00:24:50.030,00:24:51.657,"MAN 2: Yeah, let me unhook it."
00:24:59.832,00:25:01.334,MAN 3: Slide it up right there.
00:25:01.334,00:25:02.793,To the left.
00:25:02.793,00:25:05.045,"MAN 5: Yeah, yeah."
00:25:05.045,00:25:06.755,Come on.
00:25:28.486,00:25:30.279,Morning. Coffee on?
00:25:30.279,00:25:32.072,Great.
00:25:32.072,00:25:34.367,SUZANNE: Billy Beane's office.
00:25:34.367,00:25:35.617,Peter Brand.
00:25:35.617,00:25:37.328,How are--?
00:25:37.328,00:25:38.704,Nice to see you.
00:25:38.704,00:25:41.040,Good to have you here.
00:25:41.040,00:25:43.167,"Yeah, yeah. I got here early this morning."
00:25:43.167,00:25:45.419,Wow. Huh.
00:25:45.419,00:25:48.130,All moved in.
00:25:48.130,00:25:50.007,PETER: Yeah.
00:25:50.007,00:25:58.391,"Hey, Billy, I wanted you to see these player evaluations that you asked me to do."
00:25:58.391,00:26:00.851,I asked you to do three.
00:26:00.851,00:26:02.478,Yeah.
00:26:02.478,00:26:03.896,To evaluate three players.
00:26:03.896,00:26:05.272,Yeah.
00:26:05.272,00:26:07.358,How many did you do?
00:26:07.358,00:26:09.443,Forty-seven.
00:26:10.486,00:26:11.945,Okay.
00:26:11.945,00:26:13.947,"Actually, 51."
00:26:13.947,00:26:16.492,I don't know why I lied just then.
00:26:25.501,00:26:27.711,Why don't you walk me through the board?
00:26:29.213,00:26:30.839,Thank you.
00:26:57.032,00:27:04.998,"PETER: Using this equation in the upper left, I'm projecting that we need to win at least 99 games in order to make it to the postseason."
00:27:04.998,00:27:12.465,We need to score at least 814 runs in order to win those games and allow no more than 645 runs.
00:27:17.261,00:27:20.222,BILLY: What's this?
00:27:17.261,00:27:22.849,PETER: This is a code that I've written for our year-to-year projections.
00:27:22.849,00:27:26.353,This is building in the intelligence that we have to project players.
00:27:26.353,00:27:27.729,BILLY: Okay.
00:27:27.729,00:27:31.108,PETER: It's about getting things down to one number.
00:27:31.108,00:27:36.780,"Using the stats the way we read them, we'll find value in players that nobody else can see."
00:27:40.200,00:27:45.663,People are overlooked for a variety of biased reasons and perceived flaws.
00:27:45.663,00:27:49.168,"Age, appearance, personality."
00:27:49.168,00:27:53.839,Bill James and mathematics cut straight through that.
00:27:55.382,00:28:08.437,"Billy, of the 20,000 notable players for us to consider, I believe that there is a championship team of 25 people that we can afford, because everyone else in baseball undervalues them."
00:28:08.437,00:28:11.731,Like an island of misfit toys.
00:28:16.111,00:28:19.448,"Billy, this is Chad Bradford."
00:28:19.448,00:28:23.827,He is one of the most undervalued players in baseball.
00:28:23.827,00:28:27.623,His defect is that he throws funny.
00:28:27.623,00:28:31.960,Nobody in the big leagues cares about him because he looks funny.
00:28:31.960,00:28:38.717,"This guy could be not just the best pitcher in our pen, but one of the most effective relief pitchers in all baseball."
00:28:38.717,00:28:41.595,This guy should cost $3 million a year.
00:28:41.595,00:28:44.640,"We can get him for 237,000."
00:29:08.455,00:29:09.956,PETER: Billy.
00:29:11.375,00:29:13.877,That it?
00:29:43.990,00:29:45.618,"Hey, Art."
00:29:45.618,00:29:47.869,Can I talk to you before you get started?
00:29:47.869,00:29:50.330,I'm a bit busy right now.
00:29:52.207,00:29:53.959,I know.
00:29:53.959,00:29:55.919,"Morning, everyone."
00:29:55.919,00:29:59.214,Peter Brand. Nice to meet you.
00:29:59.214,00:30:01.174,That's Pete.
00:30:01.174,00:30:04.803,Grab a seat.
00:30:04.803,00:30:06.930,POLONI: Where did you say he's at?
00:30:06.930,00:30:11.435,KEOUGH: Okay. He's on-- Who's the kid?
00:30:13.270,00:30:16.315,I can't manage this team under a one-year contract.
00:30:16.315,00:30:18.233,"Well, sure you can."
00:30:19.777,00:30:22.237,"No, I can't."
00:30:22.237,00:30:24.990,Okay. I gotta put a team on the field.
00:30:24.990,00:30:28.494,"After that, I'll take a good long look at your contract."
00:30:28.494,00:30:32.038,"Deal with the manager's contract, then put a team on the field."
00:30:32.038,00:30:37.127,"At this moment, if a grounder's hit to first, nobody's there to stop it."
00:30:37.127,00:30:41.674,It's not easy doing what I do under the cloud of a one-year contract.
00:30:41.674,00:30:43.258,"Okay, I understand that."
00:30:43.258,00:30:45.511,I've been there.
00:30:45.511,00:30:50.015,A one-year contract means the same thing to a manager as to a player.
00:30:50.015,00:30:52.392,There's not a lot of faith there.
00:30:52.392,00:30:55.270,Which is strange after a 102-win season.
00:30:55.270,00:30:58.357,I see.
00:30:58.357,00:31:02.695,"If you lose the last game of the season, nobody gives a shit."
00:31:04.780,00:31:08.742,So it's on me now?
00:31:08.742,00:31:12.287,And the kid is the new assistant GM.
00:31:12.287,00:31:14.414,Okay.
00:31:14.414,00:31:16.041,"GRADY: Hey, Billy."
00:31:26.552,00:31:29.346,You can't deny his offensive output. He can play.
00:31:29.346,00:31:32.307,And we need people that can play.
00:31:38.522,00:31:41.024,Who do you wanna talk about first?
00:31:57.624,00:31:59.959,None of them.
00:31:59.959,00:32:03.547,"Billy, we got 38 home runs, 120 RBIs to make up for."
00:32:03.547,00:32:06.132,"Guys, you're still trying to replace Giambi."
00:32:06.132,00:32:10.303,"I told you we can't do it, and we can't do it."
00:32:10.303,00:32:14.600,"Now, what we might be able to do is re-create him."
00:32:14.600,00:32:16.476,Re-create him in the aggregate.
00:32:16.476,00:32:17.728,GRADY: The what?
00:32:17.728,00:32:20.689,Giambi's on-base percentage was .477.
00:32:20.689,00:32:25.235,"Damon's on-base, .324."
00:32:25.235,00:32:27.487,Add that up and you get...
00:32:30.156,00:32:32.451,Do you want me to speak?
00:32:32.451,00:32:34.536,"When I point at you, yeah."
00:32:34.536,00:32:36.663,1.092.
00:32:37.790,00:32:38.998,.364.
00:32:38.998,00:32:40.709,That's what we're looking for.
00:32:40.709,00:32:44.838,Three ballplayers-- Three ballplayers whose average OBP is...
00:32:44.838,00:32:46.339,.364.
00:32:46.339,00:32:48.258,ARTIE: That doesn't come out right.
00:32:48.258,00:32:49.843,"BILLY: It's right, Artie."
00:32:49.843,00:32:51.845,GRADY: Billy.
00:32:51.845,00:32:54.306,Billy.
00:32:54.306,00:32:55.557,Yeah?
00:32:55.557,00:32:57.309,GRADY: Who's that?
00:32:57.309,00:32:59.937,That's Pete.
00:32:59.937,00:33:02.606,GRADY: Does Pete need to be here?
00:33:02.606,00:33:03.857,"Yes, he does."
00:33:05.317,00:33:07.903,"Okay, here's who we want."
00:33:07.903,00:33:11.323,"Number one: Jason's little brother, Jeremy."
00:33:11.323,00:33:14.367,"KEOUGH: Oh, God."
00:33:14.367,00:33:16.286,"Billy, look, if I-- Yeah."
00:33:16.286,00:33:21.792,"Billy, if I may, he's had his problems off the field, and we know what he can't do on the field."
00:33:21.792,00:33:24.377,PITTARO: He's getting thick around the waist.
00:33:24.377,00:33:26.880,"There's reports about him on weed, in strip clubs."
00:33:26.880,00:33:29.675,His on-base percentage is all we're looking at now.
00:33:29.675,00:33:35.263,"And Jeremy gets on base an awful lot for a guy who only costs 285,000."
00:33:35.263,00:33:41.854,"PITTARO: Jeez, Billy-- BILLY: Number two: David Justice."
00:33:41.854,00:33:43.939,ARTIE: His legs are gone.
00:33:43.939,00:33:46.107,PITTARO: Old Man Justice?
00:33:46.107,00:33:50.988,"Steinbrenner's so pissed at his decline, he's willing to eat his contract to get rid of him."
00:33:50.988,00:33:52.155,Exactly.
00:33:52.155,00:33:53.907,"Ten years ago, Justice, big name."
00:33:53.907,00:33:55.575,Been in big games.
00:33:55.575,00:34:03.458,"He's gonna help our season tickets early in the year, but in the dog days in July, August, we're lucky if he's gonna hit his weight."
00:34:03.458,00:34:07.253,"Billy, his legs are gone, and he's a defensive liability."
00:34:07.253,00:34:09.548,I question whether the bat speed's there.
00:34:09.548,00:34:11.299,His legs are gone.
00:34:11.299,00:34:13.301,We'll be lucky to get 60 games out of him.
00:34:13.301,00:34:15.679,Why do you like him?
00:34:15.679,00:34:17.514,Because he gets on base.
00:34:19.391,00:34:21.852,HOPKINS: What is this?
00:34:21.852,00:34:31.194,"BILLY: Okay, number three: Scott Hatteberg."
00:34:31.194,00:34:32.696,MAN 2: Hatteberg?
00:34:32.696,00:34:34.489,He sounds like an Oakland A already.
00:34:34.489,00:34:38.368,"Yes, he's had a little problem with-- Little problem?"
00:34:38.368,00:34:40.286,HOPKINS: He's a career .260 hitter.
00:34:40.286,00:34:42.455,The best part of his career is over.
00:34:42.455,00:34:44.041,It's just getting started.
00:34:44.041,00:34:45.417,Boston wants to cut him.
00:34:45.417,00:34:46.919,No one wants to pick him up.
00:34:46.919,00:34:48.127,Good. He's cheap.
00:34:48.127,00:34:49.796,GRADY: Let me get this straight.
00:34:49.796,00:34:58.805,You're gonna get a guy that's been released by half the organizations in baseball because he's got nonrepairable nerve damage in his elbow and can't throw.
00:34:58.805,00:35:02.267,He can't throw and he can't field. But what can he do?
00:35:02.267,00:35:03.685,"MAN 3: Oh, boy."
00:35:03.685,00:35:06.104,Check your reports or I'm gonna point at Pete.
00:35:06.104,00:35:07.522,ALL: He gets on base.
00:35:07.522,00:35:08.774,He can get on base.
00:35:08.774,00:35:10.025,So he walks a lot.
00:35:10.025,00:35:11.610,"He gets on base a lot, Rocco."
00:35:11.610,00:35:14.320,Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?
00:35:14.320,00:35:15.906,Pete?
00:35:15.906,00:35:18.324,You do not.
00:35:18.324,00:35:21.578,BARRY: I got 37 free agents that are better than those three guys.
00:35:21.578,00:35:23.914,"Wait a minute, let me get this straight."
00:35:23.914,00:35:30.837,So you're not gonna bring in one but three defective players to replace Giambi?
00:35:30.837,00:35:33.339,You're not buying into this Bill James bullshit?
00:35:33.339,00:35:35.717,BILLY: This is the new direction of the A's.
00:35:35.717,00:35:41.556,We are card counters at the blackjack table and we're gonna turn the odds on the casino.
00:35:42.808,00:35:45.018,I don't see it.
00:35:45.018,00:35:47.604,I think we have to remember this is the man.
00:35:47.604,00:35:53.110,He answers to no one except ownership and God.
00:35:53.110,00:35:56.154,And he doesn't have to answer to us.
00:35:56.154,00:35:58.740,"We make suggestions, he makes decisions."
00:35:58.740,00:36:06.414,"GRADY: That's all fine and well, but we've been working our asses off for weeks to make this club better, and you're shitting all over it."
00:36:06.414,00:36:08.959,This is not a discussion.
00:36:11.044,00:36:12.754,BARRY: What are we discussing?
00:36:12.754,00:36:14.714,"Barry, not a discussion."
00:36:19.594,00:36:25.934,"WASHINGTON: Billy, man, um, there's one thing you're forgetting."
00:36:25.934,00:36:30.730,None of those three guys knows how to play first base.
00:36:30.730,00:36:33.150,"Well, you're gonna have to teach one of them."
00:36:33.150,00:36:34.734,WASHINGTON: Teach?
00:36:34.734,00:36:37.362,Which one?
00:36:48.957,00:36:53.336,This is the kickoff to the holiday season here in downtown Seattle.
00:36:53.336,00:36:57.757,"It took weeks of planning to lead up to the big event, but it was well worth it."
00:36:57.757,00:36:59.051,The weather was ideal.
00:36:59.051,00:37:01.302,People are still having a great time.
00:37:01.302,00:37:03.388,Thousands of people were out earlier.
00:37:03.388,00:37:14.524,MAN: We have a nice recap for you of all the great events taking place downtown in Seattle-- Hello?
00:37:14.524,00:37:15.942,Yes.
00:37:15.942,00:37:17.903,It's Billy Beane of the Oakland A's.
00:37:17.903,00:37:19.029,Yes.
00:37:19.029,00:37:21.990,Can we talk?
00:37:21.990,00:37:24.868,Do you wanna let us in?
00:37:24.868,00:37:27.495,Pardon me?
00:37:28.872,00:37:31.332,What?
00:37:31.332,00:37:33.085,"Uh, yeah, yeah."
00:37:34.961,00:37:36.213,Honey?
00:37:40.425,00:37:42.594,"Oh, thank you."
00:37:42.594,00:37:44.303,Very kind.
00:37:47.473,00:37:49.851,"How's the elbow, Scott?"
00:37:49.851,00:37:51.228,"You know, it's good."
00:37:51.228,00:37:53.855,It's really good.
00:37:59.485,00:38:00.820,I can't throw the ball at all.
00:38:00.820,00:38:02.363,BILLY: Yeah.
00:38:02.363,00:38:05.075,You've thrown your last ball from behind home plate.
00:38:05.075,00:38:07.368,That's what I'd say.
00:38:07.368,00:38:11.123,"Good news is, we want you at first."
00:38:18.504,00:38:21.967,We want you to play first base for the Oakland A's.
00:38:23.135,00:38:27.430,"Okay, well, I've only ever played catcher."
00:38:27.430,00:38:31.059,"Scott, you're not a catcher anymore."
00:38:31.059,00:38:35.354,"If you were, our call wouldn't have been the only one you got."
00:38:35.354,00:38:38.399,"Yeah. Hey, listen, no, I appreciate it."
00:38:38.399,00:38:39.651,You're welcome.
00:38:39.651,00:38:42.654,"SCOTT: But the thing is, is..."
00:38:42.654,00:38:44.489,You don't know how to play first base.
00:38:44.489,00:38:46.241,Scott.
00:38:46.241,00:38:48.326,"It's not that hard, Scott."
00:38:48.326,00:38:50.745,"Tell him, Wash."
00:38:50.745,00:38:54.082,"Hey, anything worth doing is."
00:38:54.082,00:38:56.501,Wait a minute here.
00:38:56.501,00:38:59.171,"Jason's gone, Scott."
00:38:59.171,00:39:01.840,You want me to take Giambi's spot at first base?
00:39:01.840,00:39:03.675,Yeah.
00:39:03.675,00:39:06.928,Maybe I can teach one of them.
00:39:06.928,00:39:08.513,Fans don't run my ball club.
00:39:08.513,00:39:10.932,SCOTT: What are you doing awake?
00:39:10.932,00:39:12.851,"Sweetheart, can you...?"
00:39:14.602,00:39:16.521,That's my daughter.
00:39:17.814,00:39:19.983,You got kids?
00:39:19.983,00:39:22.735,"Uh, yeah, a daughter."
00:39:22.735,00:39:27.282,"Scott, this is a contract to play ball for the Oakland A's."
00:39:27.282,00:39:29.575,A copy's been sent over to your agent.
00:39:29.575,00:39:33.412,"Discuss with your wife, let us know."
00:39:33.412,00:39:34.747,Thank you.
00:39:34.747,00:39:36.291,Bye-bye.
00:39:36.291,00:39:38.293,"Oh, and, Scott."
00:39:38.293,00:39:40.628,Don't tell anyone about the first-base thing.
00:39:40.628,00:39:42.088,"Yes, sir."
00:39:42.088,00:39:44.674,Happy holidays.
00:40:09.699,00:40:11.659,"BILLY: Hey, Sharon."
00:40:11.659,00:40:14.079,Is she ready?
00:40:15.955,00:40:18.666,But she'll be back.
00:40:18.666,00:40:19.709,Okay.
00:40:19.709,00:40:21.294,MAN: She's right here. Hold on.
00:40:21.294,00:40:22.712,Here you go.
00:40:24.756,00:40:28.343,"Here, wanna have a seat?"
00:40:37.102,00:40:39.520,"You good, Billy?"
00:40:39.520,00:40:42.899,Good. Really good. Things are peaceful around here.
00:40:44.859,00:40:47.070,It's good to see you.
00:40:47.070,00:40:49.239,"BILLY: Thanks, Alan."
00:40:49.239,00:40:51.616,I haven't got to see you since play-offs.
00:40:51.616,00:40:54.202,I wanted to say that New York was heartbreaking.
00:40:54.202,00:40:56.246,I'm sure for you too.
00:40:56.246,00:41:02.294,"Not many teams make it that far, and to watch you go that far was-- It was really an accomplishment."
00:41:02.294,00:41:06.756,"BILLY: Well, that's nice."
00:41:06.756,00:41:09.217,How is the team shaping up?
00:41:09.217,00:41:13.138,Team's good. Rebuilding.
00:41:13.138,00:41:16.308,I read you lost Giambonni and Damon.
00:41:16.308,00:41:17.516,Giambi.
00:41:17.516,00:41:20.061,Yeah.
00:41:20.061,00:41:21.854,They're really--?
00:41:21.854,00:41:24.523,Gone.
00:41:24.523,00:41:25.942,ALAN: That's terrible.
00:41:25.942,00:41:27.986,"No, but that is a tough situation."
00:41:27.986,00:41:29.779,That's...
00:41:29.779,00:41:31.364,"You're gonna be fine, though."
00:41:31.364,00:41:33.199,You always figure something out.
00:41:37.162,00:41:40.248,Where is she? Where was she?
00:41:40.248,00:41:42.583,"Oh, sorry, yeah. I just talked to her on her cell."
00:41:42.583,00:41:44.627,She's coming up the hill.
00:41:44.627,00:41:46.171,Okay.
00:41:46.171,00:41:48.506,BILLY: She's got a cell phone?
00:41:48.506,00:41:49.715,SHARON: Yeah.
00:41:49.715,00:41:51.592,A 12-year-old?
00:41:51.592,00:41:53.594,Yeah.
00:41:53.594,00:41:55.972,BILLY: Huh.
00:41:55.972,00:41:57.307,For emergencies.
00:41:59.184,00:42:01.853,Big parenting decision.
00:42:01.853,00:42:09.861,"But it's something that, you know, we, you know, all should discuss, because if you have any objections, of course..."
00:42:09.861,00:42:13.156,BILLY: Her mother and I will discuss it.
00:42:13.156,00:42:14.866,But thank you.
00:42:17.869,00:42:20.288,Any of these?
00:42:20.288,00:42:21.998,I don't know.
00:42:21.998,00:42:24.209,Do you--?
00:42:24.209,00:42:25.918,BILLY: Is that good or bad?
00:42:25.918,00:42:28.087,Butterflies.
00:42:28.087,00:42:31.090,"Look, that one's pretty."
00:42:31.090,00:42:33.385,Should we try?
00:42:33.385,00:42:34.927,No?
00:42:34.927,00:42:36.721,"Oh, I like this one."
00:42:36.721,00:42:38.264,"Dad, look at this one."
00:42:38.264,00:42:40.725,Look how it's red.
00:42:40.725,00:42:43.269,This one's pretty.
00:42:43.269,00:42:45.813,Just right here?
00:42:45.813,00:42:48.441,Can we go over there?
00:43:05.958,00:43:07.877,"BILLY: Oh, honey, you need to sing."
00:43:07.877,00:43:10.713,That's so good.
00:43:10.713,00:43:12.798,That's beautiful.
00:43:14.384,00:43:15.634,Sometimes I sing.
00:43:15.634,00:43:21.307,"It's fun to sing with your song, but I don't want people to listen to me."
00:43:21.307,00:43:23.893,"Well, honey, I think people would love to listen to you."
00:43:23.893,00:43:26.271,That's beautiful.
00:43:26.271,00:43:29.065,Would you sing a little for your dad?
00:43:29.065,00:43:31.067,Right here in the middle of the store?
00:43:34.529,00:43:36.864,Little bit.
00:43:38.575,00:43:40.493,You ready?
00:43:40.493,00:43:41.953,Okay.
00:44:15.694,00:44:19.574,ANNOUNCER 1: Billy Beane was taken in the first round of the amateur draft.
00:44:19.574,00:44:22.452,"ANNOUNCER 2: I think this is a steal, to get Billy Beane."
00:44:22.452,00:44:23.869,"He's young, he's talented."
00:44:23.869,00:44:26.456,A true five-tool player with speed.
00:44:26.456,00:44:28.333,This guy is a can't-miss prospect.
00:44:28.333,00:44:30.835,This is a great sign for the New York Mets.
00:44:30.835,00:44:34.589,ANNOUNCER 1: And it could be the turnaround that they've been looking for.
00:44:34.589,00:44:36.174,UMPIRE: Ball one.
00:44:36.174,00:44:38.635,ANNOUNCER 1: I'll take Beane over Strawberry.
00:44:38.635,00:44:42.639,"ANNOUNCER 2: Billy Beane, an interesting pick, turned down a scholarship."
00:44:42.639,00:44:44.223,He could've gone to Stanford.
00:44:44.223,00:44:47.644,Sometimes you don't find out till you get to the big leagues...
00:44:47.644,00:44:48.894,UMPIRE: Strike!
00:44:48.894,00:44:50.938,This guy has never failed at anything.
00:44:50.938,00:44:52.482,He's coming out of high school.
00:44:52.482,00:44:53.858,Billy was gonna go to college.
00:44:53.858,00:44:56.194,He could've been a great quarterback.
00:45:04.035,00:45:05.995,UMPIRE: Strike three.
00:45:05.995,00:45:15.046,ANNOUNCER 3: There's not an organization in baseball who would not have taken a chance on this young guy.
00:45:16.506,00:45:19.800,He didn't pan out.
00:45:20.843,00:45:23.012,"Some do, some don't."
00:45:24.972,00:45:28.351,"MOM: I mean, if you're having any doubt at all about this..."
00:45:30.562,00:45:32.313,Having the scholarship...
00:45:32.313,00:45:35.608,MARTINEZ: Your son was born with a God-given ability.
00:45:35.608,00:45:44.659,ANNOUNCER 3: Few scouts can go into the mind of a young man and determine whether he's really confident about what he can do.
00:45:44.659,00:45:46.411,MAN: A very special player.
00:45:46.411,00:45:53.167,"ANNOUNCER 3: So you can sign him based on his ability, but then he's gotta be successful to be confident."
00:45:53.167,00:45:57.754,"And once he becomes confident, that's when you've got something."
00:46:01.217,00:46:04.637,You make a decision on what you see.
00:46:04.637,00:46:08.349,"And if things don't pan out, you move on."
00:46:08.349,00:46:10.518,That's baseball.
00:46:10.518,00:46:12.729,"Many are called, few are chosen."
00:46:14.522,00:46:16.566,"PETER: Billy, that is Kevin Youkilis."
00:46:16.566,00:46:19.444,That is the Greek God of Walks.
00:46:19.444,00:46:21.070,That's my hero.
00:46:21.070,00:46:26.367,That man gets walked more than anybody in baseball except for Barry Bonds.
00:46:26.367,00:46:32.831,"I tried to convince Shapiro to pick him up last June, but he said he waddled like a duck."
00:46:32.831,00:46:35.209,"Yeah, Boston snagged him."
00:46:35.209,00:46:37.086,I think they wanna wait and see.
00:46:44.009,00:46:45.303,"Are you okay, Billy?"
00:46:45.303,00:46:47.346,GRADY: Billy?
00:46:47.346,00:46:49.348,Can we talk?
00:46:49.348,00:46:52.059,Yeah. Yeah.
00:47:02.445,00:47:05.197,"You're unhappy, Grady. Why?"
00:47:08.867,00:47:11.245,Wow.
00:47:11.245,00:47:13.706,May I speak candidly?
00:47:13.706,00:47:21.964,"Major League Baseball and its fans, they're gonna be more than happy to throw you and Google Boy under the bus if you keep doing what you're doing."
00:47:21.964,00:47:24.925,You don't put a team together with a computer.
00:47:24.925,00:47:26.927,No?
00:47:26.927,00:47:29.846,Baseball isn't just numbers.
00:47:29.846,00:47:35.102,"If it was, anybody could do what we're doing, but they can't."
00:47:35.102,00:47:38.272,They don't have our experience and our intuition.
00:47:38.272,00:47:39.898,Okay.
00:47:39.898,00:47:44.111,You got a kid in there that's got a degree in economics from Yale.
00:47:44.111,00:47:47.239,You got a scout here with 29 years of baseball experience.
00:47:47.239,00:47:50.201,You're listening to the wrong one.
00:47:50.201,00:47:54.079,"Now, there are intangibles that only baseball people understand."
00:47:54.079,00:47:57.333,You're discounting what scouts have done for 150 years?
00:47:57.333,00:47:58.543,Even yourself?
00:48:00.127,00:48:02.296,Adapt or die.
00:48:05.257,00:48:07.760,"This is about you and your shit, isn't it?"
00:48:07.760,00:48:09.846,"Twenty years ago, some scout got it wrong."
00:48:09.846,00:48:11.347,Whoa. Okay. Okay.
00:48:11.347,00:48:13.641,Now you declare war on the system.
00:48:13.641,00:48:18.270,"Okay, okay, my turn."
00:48:18.270,00:48:22.316,You can't look at a kid and predict his future any more than I can.
00:48:22.316,00:48:27.946,"I've sat at those kitchen tables with you and listened to you tell parents, When I know, I know."
00:48:27.946,00:48:29.990,"And when it comes to your son, I know."
00:48:29.990,00:48:32.410,And you don't.
00:48:33.994,00:48:35.830,You don't.
00:48:38.374,00:48:43.713,"Okay. I don't give a shit about friendship, this situation, or the past."
00:48:43.713,00:48:46.006,Major League Baseball thinks the way I think.
00:48:46.006,00:48:47.508,You're not gonna win.
00:48:47.508,00:48:50.052,And I'll give you a nickel's worth of free advice.
00:48:50.052,00:48:56.434,You're never gonna get another job after this catastrophic season you're about to set us all up for.
00:48:56.434,00:49:01.063,You'll have to explain to your kid why you're working at Dick's Sporting Goods.
00:49:07.027,00:49:09.363,"I'm not gonna fire you, Grady."
00:49:13.033,00:49:14.243,"Fuck you, Billy."
00:49:14.243,00:49:16.454,Now I will.
00:49:20.249,00:49:22.126,"Good luck, Art."
00:49:28.299,00:49:31.594,Kubota.
00:49:31.594,00:49:34.472,I played a little T-ball.
00:49:34.472,00:49:36.265,Congratulations.
00:49:44.607,00:49:46.901,So Boston's gonna wait and see?
00:49:48.527,00:49:49.862,Yeah.
00:49:51.238,00:49:53.866,Yeah.
00:49:53.866,00:49:56.285,And we're all in.
00:49:58.830,00:50:03.334,CALLER 1: It sounds like you're apologizing for what they're doing.
00:50:03.334,00:50:08.130,HOST: I'm not. I just don't know what you're gonna do with the budget that the A's have.
00:50:08.130,00:50:09.465,Who are you gonna get?
00:50:09.465,00:50:11.300,CALLER 2: I'm looking at the roster.
00:50:11.300,00:50:13.302,You gotta be kidding me.
00:50:13.302,00:50:15.680,CALLER 1: Looked like a clown.
00:50:15.680,00:50:17.055,CALLER 1: Chad Bradford.
00:50:17.055,00:50:19.391,BILLY: Tell me about Bradford.
00:50:19.391,00:50:22.060,"MAN 1: I like him a little bit, but he's a specialist."
00:50:22.060,00:50:26.983,"He's not a guy that you say, The eighth inning is yours, lefties vs. righties."
00:50:26.983,00:50:28.860,In my opinion.
00:50:28.860,00:50:33.113,HOST: I don't know what Billy Beane and management understands about him.
00:50:33.113,00:50:35.616,"He only throws the ball about 82, 83 miles an hour."
00:50:35.616,00:50:40.621,"There must be something-- CALLER 1: He is a freak, and not in a good way."
00:50:40.621,00:50:43.457,MAN 2: Talking about trying to win a division.
00:50:43.457,00:50:46.377,We're counting on David to be the guy he was.
00:50:46.377,00:50:49.087,I have my doubts.
00:50:49.087,00:50:52.675,"That's why he's not in New York anymore, not in Cleveland anymore."
00:50:52.675,00:50:56.303,CALLER 3: We paid him the money we should've been giving to Johnny Damon.
00:50:56.303,00:50:57.388,HOST: Hey.
00:50:57.388,00:50:58.806,CALLER 4: Jeremy Giambi.
00:50:58.806,00:51:00.432,That's the one to worry about.
00:51:00.432,00:51:03.352,He gets comps up and down Vegas more than in Oakland.
00:51:03.352,00:51:05.688,That should tell you something right there.
00:51:05.688,00:51:08.399,CALLER 5: Isn't that the deal with these guys?
00:51:08.399,00:51:10.442,CALLER 6: He has one good year.
00:51:10.442,00:51:13.654,And he gets a huge offer and then he gets traded.
00:51:15.155,00:51:16.908,Bob. Harder.
00:51:16.908,00:51:19.075,BOB: Hatteberg.
00:51:22.162,00:51:24.164,Good. Good.
00:51:25.917,00:51:28.252,"BOB: Billy, we have to talk about Hatteberg."
00:51:28.252,00:51:29.628,BILLY: Go.
00:51:29.628,00:51:31.756,BOB: There's just no feel for the spot.
00:51:31.756,00:51:35.300,I think it's a long shot that he can be a big-league first baseman.
00:51:35.300,00:51:38.303,It's day one of the first week.
00:51:38.303,00:51:40.305,"No, I think we can judge it."
00:51:40.305,00:51:44.602,"I mean, I like him, you know, but I can judge him."
00:51:44.602,00:51:46.395,First base is the moon to him.
00:51:46.395,00:51:48.397,It wasn't to Giambi.
00:51:48.397,00:51:50.900,Giambi's the worst first baseman in baseball.
00:51:50.900,00:51:53.903,Gonna compare him to Giambi?
00:51:53.903,00:51:55.529,All right.
00:51:57.322,00:51:59.366,"What do you think, Wash?"
00:51:59.366,00:52:02.912,The nice way to say it is he lacks confidence.
00:52:02.912,00:52:05.039,"Well, give him some."
00:52:05.039,00:52:07.833,"I'll do that, but we got Peña, who can play first."
00:52:07.833,00:52:11.087,And he's looking mighty good out there.
00:52:11.087,00:52:13.089,We wanna go with Hattie.
00:52:18.176,00:52:19.971,We got six weeks.
00:52:19.971,00:52:21.973,WASHINGTON: Get down in it.
00:52:27.937,00:52:29.814,There you go.
00:52:29.814,00:52:32.357,That's what I'm talking about.
00:52:32.357,00:52:34.610,WASHINGTON: It's only baseball.
00:52:40.741,00:52:42.785,This better work.
00:52:44.078,00:52:46.122,I'm just kidding you.
00:53:00.176,00:53:02.638,"Let's go, Oakland!"
00:53:02.638,00:53:04.473,"Let's go, Oakland!"
00:53:07.476,00:53:08.936,What is wrong with this thing?
00:53:08.936,00:53:10.896,"It's a dollar, man."
00:53:10.896,00:53:13.649,What?
00:53:13.649,00:53:15.734,"Oh, you gotta be shitting me."
00:53:15.734,00:53:22.240,"I think this year, we're gonna show that it takes a team to win, not any individual guy, just a team."
00:53:22.240,00:53:25.744,And I think we got a hell of a ball club here.
00:53:25.744,00:53:27.913,"REPORTER: Chad, are you intimidated today?"
00:53:27.913,00:53:30.041,"I wouldn't say I'm intimidated, really."
00:53:30.041,00:53:32.710,"I'm just really excited, like you said."
00:53:32.710,00:53:36.964,"REPORTER: Jeremy, how's the team gonna fare without your brother, Jason?"
00:53:36.964,00:53:42.636,"Well, you know, the organization did a great job of bringing in good young guys to fill that role."
00:53:42.636,00:53:45.097,"Let's face it, they're getting a deal with you."
00:53:45.097,00:53:47.349,The Yankees are paying Jason a lot of money.
00:53:47.349,00:53:50.895,You are coming here on a dime.
00:53:50.895,00:53:52.437,I feel good. Um...
00:53:52.437,00:53:54.523,How are the nerves in your fingers?
00:53:54.523,00:53:56.150,You know.
00:53:56.150,00:53:58.652,"Gotta start with the age, 36 years old."
00:53:58.652,00:54:00.863,How do you think your body's gonna hold up?
00:54:00.863,00:54:04.116,"You spend a lot of time at strip clubs, partying."
00:54:04.116,00:54:06.410,Do you resent the attention you get off the field?
00:54:06.410,00:54:07.745,I love it.
00:54:07.745,00:54:09.287,You spend a lot of time in Vegas.
00:54:09.287,00:54:10.581,I do.
00:54:10.581,00:54:12.791,I feel great.
00:54:10.581,00:54:15.002,I did a lot of work to get-- Excuse me.
00:54:15.002,00:54:16.378,"Sorry, go ahead."
00:54:16.378,00:54:22.218,"There have been questions about my age and my declining skills, some say, but I'm here to prove that wrong."
00:54:22.218,00:54:24.095,I asked if you were 100 percent.
00:54:33.062,00:54:35.064,"CHAD: Excuse me, Mr. Beane?"
00:54:35.064,00:54:36.481,"I'm not disturbing you, am I?"
00:54:36.481,00:54:38.483,Not at all. What's up?
00:54:38.483,00:54:41.695,I wanted to say thank you for this opportunity.
00:54:41.695,00:54:43.530,"Well, we enjoy having you."
00:54:43.530,00:54:45.449,It's gonna work out well for all of us.
00:54:45.449,00:54:46.784,"I appreciate it, sir."
00:54:46.784,00:54:49.369,Nobody's ever given me a chance like this before.
00:54:49.369,00:54:50.996,Nobody?
00:54:52.123,00:54:54.625,"Well, just you, sir."
00:54:54.625,00:54:58.254,"Well, it's a big day, one you won't forget."
00:54:58.254,00:55:00.422,Appreciate it.
00:54:58.254,00:55:02.758,And I wanna let you know I'm gonna be praying for you and your family.
00:55:03.884,00:55:06.386,No problem.
00:55:06.386,00:55:12.226,"ANNOUNCER: Well, here we are just minutes away from the season opener of 2002 for the Oakland A's."
00:55:12.226,00:55:13.852,The first pitch is moments away.
00:55:13.852,00:55:16.147,We'll come back with the national anthem.
00:55:16.147,00:55:18.857,Opening day is upon us.
00:55:18.857,00:55:21.235,"All right, fellas, smile."
00:55:29.076,00:55:31.369,I'm going in.
00:55:31.369,00:55:33.329,What? Why?
00:55:33.329,00:55:36.125,I don't watch the games.
00:55:44.591,00:55:46.218,"MAN: Detail, halt!"
00:55:47.343,00:55:49.930,And forward face!
00:56:50.699,00:56:53.952,That's the third Ranger batter to be hit today.
00:56:53.952,00:57:36.536,Twice Alex Rodriguez was nicked. The ninth-- I should've made you a bigger part of the conversation from day one.
00:57:36.536,00:57:38.663,It'd be clear what we're trying to do.
00:57:38.663,00:57:41.708,"That was my mistake, Art."
00:57:41.708,00:57:43.543,What are you trying to say?
00:57:43.543,00:57:48.382,Doesn't matter what moves I make if you don't play the team the way they're designed to be.
00:57:48.382,00:57:52.136,"Billy, you're out of your depth."
00:57:53.762,00:57:56.723,Why not Hatteberg at first?
00:57:56.723,00:57:59.351,How do you know?
00:57:59.351,00:58:02.187,Scott Hatteberg can't hit.
00:58:02.187,00:58:03.981,Still keeps us in the plus column.
00:58:03.981,00:58:06.733,We need to be seven over .500.
00:58:10.612,00:58:13.031,Anything else?
00:58:13.031,00:58:17.828,Yeah. I would've rather seen Bradford in the end than Magnante.
00:58:17.828,00:58:18.954,Bradford's a righty.
00:58:18.954,00:58:20.622,I don't care about righty-lefty.
00:58:20.622,00:58:22.249,I do.
00:58:26.878,00:58:29.506,Could this be about your contract?
00:58:29.506,00:58:30.882,No.
00:58:30.882,00:58:34.761,This is about you doing your job and me doing mine.
00:58:34.761,00:58:39.057,Mine's me being left alone to manage this team you assembled for me.
00:58:39.057,00:58:41.018,"I didn't assemble them for you, Art."
00:58:41.018,00:58:42.478,No shit.
00:58:51.362,00:58:53.113,Good meeting.
00:58:53.113,00:58:57.493,"Every time we talk, I'm reinvigorated by my love of the game."
00:59:20.015,00:59:24.436,"We got Grady Fuson, former head of scouting with the Athletics."
00:59:24.436,00:59:27.064,"And, Grady, can you interpret for us what's going on?"
00:59:27.064,00:59:28.565,GRADY: They call it Moneyball.
00:59:28.565,00:59:29.816,HOST: Moneyball?
00:59:29.816,00:59:34.196,"GRADY: Yes, and it was a nice theory, and now it's just not working out."
00:59:34.196,00:59:43.163,"COMMENTATOR: Billy Beane has built this team on the ideas of a guy, Bill James, who wrote an interesting book on baseball statistics."
00:59:43.163,00:59:47.459,"The problem is that Bill James never played, never managed."
00:59:47.459,00:59:52.047,He was in fact a security guard at a pork-and-beans company.
00:59:52.047,00:59:54.216,HOST: Do you see this as a decimation?
00:59:54.216,00:59:56.510,GRADY: He bought a ticket on the Titanic.
00:59:56.510,00:59:58.720,"HOST: Oh, boy."
00:59:56.510,01:00:01.223,COMMENTATOR: He's tried to come up with a new approach My hat's off to him.
01:00:01.223,01:00:03.434,It won't work.
01:00:03.434,01:00:06.478,One-two pitch.
01:00:06.478,01:00:08.730,Tejada strikes out.
01:00:08.730,01:00:11.775,"The Seattle Mariners win both games on this series, Ray."
01:00:11.775,01:00:15.446,They've won 10 in a row.
01:00:18.031,01:00:21.159,I can't watch this shit.
01:00:21.159,01:00:23.203,Go on the road with the team.
01:00:23.203,01:00:25.663,PETER: You don't go on the road with the team.
01:00:25.663,01:00:27.249,That's why I want you to do it.
01:00:27.249,01:00:29.084,Why don't you?
01:00:30.710,01:00:33.713,I can't develop personal relationships with these guys.
01:00:33.713,01:00:38.218,"I gotta be able to trade them, send them down, sometimes cut them."
01:00:40.471,01:00:43.432,"Which is something you should learn to do, by the way."
01:00:46.017,01:00:48.728,"I would never have to cut a player, unless you..."
01:00:49.980,01:00:52.983,"Oh, come on."
01:00:52.983,01:00:55.693,Let's practice.
01:00:55.693,01:00:56.903,Yeah. I'm a player.
01:00:56.903,01:00:58.822,You gotta cut me from the roster. Go.
01:00:58.822,01:01:00.532,No.
01:01:00.532,01:01:01.658,No.
01:01:01.658,01:01:03.452,Do it.
01:01:03.452,01:01:05.870,"Part of the job, man."
01:01:10.125,01:01:11.668,Fine.
01:01:12.961,01:01:14.338,"Billy, please have a seat."
01:01:14.338,01:01:16.632,I need to talk to you for a minute.
01:01:16.632,01:01:18.008,Go on.
01:01:19.551,01:01:22.262,You've been a huge part of this team.
01:01:22.262,01:01:24.806,But sometimes you have to make decisions for the team.
01:01:24.806,01:01:26.517,I'm sure you can understand.
01:01:26.517,01:01:29.186,You're cutting me?
01:01:30.437,01:01:31.938,I just bought a house here.
01:01:31.938,01:01:33.857,Well...
01:01:37.486,01:01:41.114,"Well, uh... Well..."
01:01:41.114,01:01:42.616,That's all you got to say?
01:01:42.616,01:01:45.202,My kid just started a new school.
01:01:45.202,01:01:49.247,They made friends.
01:01:49.247,01:01:51.791,You shouldn't pull them out in the middle of the year.
01:01:51.791,01:01:52.917,You should wait.
01:01:52.917,01:01:55.086,What the hell are you talking about?
01:01:55.086,01:01:57.130,I don't know.
01:01:55.086,01:01:59.757,I shouldn't have-- I'm not gonna do this.
01:01:59.757,01:02:02.844,"I'm not gonna fire anybody, and this is dumb."
01:02:04.095,01:02:06.014,They're professional ballplayers.
01:02:06.014,01:02:07.516,Just be straight with them.
01:02:07.516,01:02:09.643,"No fluff, just facts."
01:02:09.643,01:02:12.020,"Pete, I gotta let you go."
01:02:12.020,01:02:14.481,Jack's office will handle the details.
01:02:17.067,01:02:18.109,That's it?
01:02:18.109,01:02:19.695,Pfft.
01:02:19.695,01:02:20.945,Really?
01:02:20.945,01:02:25.492,You rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?
01:02:26.868,01:02:29.829,Are those my only two options?
01:02:29.829,01:02:32.165,Go on the road with the team.
01:02:34.459,01:02:36.294,Okay.
01:02:45.554,01:02:47.222,"Say, bro."
01:02:47.222,01:02:49.516,Let me ask you a question.
01:02:49.516,01:02:52.436,How come your boss doesn't travel with the team?
01:02:54.396,01:02:57.857,He doesn't like to mingle with the players.
01:02:59.610,01:03:02.112,Is that supposed to make us easier to cut?
01:03:06.866,01:03:09.620,I don't know.
01:03:09.620,01:03:14.499,And how come soda is a dollar in the clubhouse?
01:03:14.499,01:03:16.960,I never seen nothing like that.
01:03:18.253,01:03:21.131,Billy likes to keep the money on the field.
01:03:21.131,01:03:25.719,Soda money?
01:03:25.719,01:03:28.930,Where on the field is the dollar I'm paying for soda?
01:03:30.641,01:03:37.689,"It's hard to see exactly, but it's there, yeah."
01:03:37.689,01:03:39.232,I'm done.
01:03:50.452,01:03:53.163,"Hey, Dad."
01:03:53.163,01:03:55.540,How are you?
01:03:55.540,01:03:57.793,Was it bumpy?
01:04:00.003,01:04:08.303,"ANNOUNCER: So with this loss tonight, the Oakland Athletics incredibly, have lost 14 of their last 17 games."
01:04:08.303,01:04:11.515,They are 10 games back in the American League West.
01:04:11.515,01:04:14.100,HOST: Is it fair to say the experiment has failed?
01:04:14.100,01:04:16.936,"COMMENTATOR 1: Well, absolutely."
01:04:16.936,01:04:21.232,"You don't wish anybody a lack of success, but the facts are in front of you."
01:04:21.232,01:04:23.276,COMMENTATOR 2: You can't blame Art Howe.
01:04:23.276,01:04:24.528,HOST: No.
01:04:24.528,01:04:29.324,"COMMENTATOR 2: The fact of the matter is, this is not about statistics, this is about people."
01:04:29.324,01:04:31.743,COMMENTATOR 1: Art Howe is not the problem.
01:04:31.743,01:04:35.872,The problem is in the general manager's office with Billy Beane.
01:04:35.872,01:04:38.875,COMMENTATOR 2: The root of the problem is philosophical.
01:04:38.875,01:04:41.044,I said it before.
01:04:41.044,01:04:42.629,Billy is just not thinking.
01:04:42.629,01:04:46.800,"CALLER 1: Start thinking about a new GM, making changes."
01:04:46.800,01:04:48.552,GRADY: This was very predictable.
01:04:48.552,01:04:51.888,CALLER 2: He needs to look at what's going on.
01:04:51.888,01:04:53.223,The man needs to get real.
01:04:53.223,01:04:55.517,CALLER 3: I want Billy Beane gone.
01:04:55.517,01:04:58.353,HOST: Calling for Beane's head.
01:04:58.353,01:05:03.483,"ANNOUNCER: The past 18 games, they've been shut out or scored one run four times."
01:05:03.483,01:05:05.402,They're just not scoring enough.
01:05:05.402,01:05:09.947,"It's not just the offense, not Thad Bosley and the hitters. It's everything."
01:05:09.947,01:05:18.790,"If there was one thing you could pick out, you'd try to fix it, but just everything is in a funk right now."
01:05:22.627,01:05:25.088,What the hell am I doing?
01:05:28.132,01:05:31.052,"Oh, man."
01:05:31.052,01:05:33.137,"BILLY: Look, Steve."
01:05:36.600,01:05:38.976,I believe in what we're doing.
01:05:38.976,01:05:44.482,The record doesn't reflect the strength of this team or where we're gonna be at the end of the season.
01:05:44.482,01:05:49.404,"Now, Pete and I here feel very strongly that we stay on the track we've chosen."
01:05:49.404,01:05:54.242,PETER: Our sample size has been too small. It's too-- BILLY: Early. It's still early.
01:05:54.242,01:05:57.704,Where do we expect to be by the All-Star break?
01:05:58.914,01:06:05.587,Our goal and our expectation is by mid-July to be within seven games of first.
01:06:05.587,01:06:07.130,That would be this working.
01:06:07.130,01:06:09.800,That keeps us in the hunt.
01:06:09.800,01:06:11.885,By July.
01:06:11.885,01:06:13.386,BILLY: July.
01:06:13.386,01:06:17.140,And what's gonna prevent you from accomplishing that?
01:06:17.140,01:06:19.058,What are you afraid of?
01:06:19.058,01:06:22.270,BILLY: Nothing.
01:06:22.270,01:06:24.021,That's why we get up in the morning.
01:06:24.021,01:06:25.356,That's all we do.
01:06:44.125,01:06:45.836,BILLY: More?
01:06:45.836,01:06:47.044,"Yeah, a little more."
01:06:47.044,01:06:51.007,Don't tell your mother.
01:06:51.007,01:06:52.759,Chocolate sauce?
01:06:53.927,01:06:55.261,Stop.
01:06:58.097,01:07:00.892,Big spoon or little spoon?
01:07:02.226,01:07:04.061,Thank you.
01:07:13.864,01:07:16.825,"Dad, there's no way you're gonna lose your job, right?"
01:07:16.825,01:07:18.785,What?
01:07:18.785,01:07:20.912,"Well, I don't know."
01:07:20.912,01:07:22.747,Where'd you hear that?
01:07:22.747,01:07:24.916,"Well, I go on the Internet sometimes."
01:07:24.916,01:07:28.294,"Well, don't do that."
01:07:28.294,01:07:33.967,Or watch TV or read newspapers or talk to people.
01:07:33.967,01:07:36.845,I don't talk to people.
01:07:36.845,01:07:39.723,"Honey, everything's fine."
01:07:39.723,01:07:41.766,"Really, you don't have to worry."
01:07:41.766,01:07:46.354,"But if you lose your job, will you have to move away?"
01:07:46.354,01:07:48.773,"Honey, I'm not gonna lose my job."
01:07:50.274,01:07:52.443,You don't have to worry.
01:07:54.571,01:07:57.114,Okay.
01:07:57.114,01:08:00.577,There's no problem.
01:08:00.577,01:08:02.579,All right?
01:08:00.577,01:08:05.540,"I got uptown problems, which are not problems at all."
01:08:05.540,01:08:07.042,"You're not worried, right?"
01:08:07.042,01:08:09.627,"No, I'm not worried."
01:08:16.760,01:08:18.511,Peña.
01:08:21.014,01:08:22.807,Okay.
01:08:35.570,01:08:46.039,"I want Dye in right, Justice DH'ing, Peña on the bench, Hatteberg at first, and anyone but Mags first out of the pen."
01:08:46.039,01:08:48.124,You want Peña on the bench?
01:08:48.124,01:08:51.461,That's right.
01:08:51.461,01:08:56.173,"Peña is not only the best first baseman, he's the only first baseman."
01:08:56.173,01:08:58.802,Hattie gets on base more than Peña.
01:08:58.802,01:09:01.387,"In fact, 20 percent more."
01:09:01.387,01:09:04.307,His fielding does not matter.
01:09:04.307,01:09:07.477,I've heard enough of this.
01:09:07.477,01:09:09.938,"And I, uh..."
01:09:09.938,01:09:13.108,"I disagree with you, plain and simple."
01:09:13.108,01:09:21.074,"And moreover, I'm playing my team in a way that I can explain in job interviews next winter."
01:09:21.074,01:09:22.867,Okay? Ahem.
01:09:27.622,01:09:30.708,Hattie. Not Peña.
01:09:35.005,01:09:36.840,"What's up, skip?"
01:09:36.840,01:09:39.009,How you doing?
01:09:39.009,01:09:41.094,Get some sleep last night?
01:09:41.094,01:09:45.723,"As the A's hit the field, we are ready for baseball."
01:09:45.723,01:09:54.065,"First one out of the dugout is rookie sensation Carlos Peña, one of the few bright lights in this lineup, taking his spot at first base."
01:10:34.064,01:10:37.567,"REPORTER: Billy, do you expect these guys to produce more or--?"
01:10:37.567,01:10:38.818,BILLY: Not now.
01:10:38.818,01:10:40.444,What's the reason for the slump?
01:10:58.713,01:11:00.131,Get down.
01:11:04.510,01:11:06.470,Is losing fun?
01:11:09.682,01:11:12.769,Is losing fun?
01:11:16.981,01:11:19.067,What are you having fun for?
01:11:44.508,01:11:46.761,That's what losing sounds like.
01:12:01.109,01:12:03.069,"Are you okay, Dad?"
01:12:03.069,01:12:05.905,You're doing it again.
01:12:05.905,01:12:08.199,You're worrying about me.
01:12:08.199,01:12:10.285,"You're in last place, Dad."
01:12:10.285,01:12:12.453,Do I look worried?
01:12:12.453,01:12:16.791,"Because you're getting on an airplane, and those things crash all the time."
01:12:16.791,01:12:18.584,Please stop worrying about your dad.
01:12:21.504,01:12:22.672,MAN: We're all set.
01:12:22.672,01:12:24.299,Okay.
01:12:25.466,01:12:27.593,I love you.
01:12:27.593,01:12:30.346,All right.
01:12:31.597,01:12:33.683,Okay.
01:13:12.471,01:13:14.098,Yeah.
01:13:20.604,01:13:21.898,"Suzanne, get me Ed Wade."
01:13:21.898,01:13:22.982,SUZANNE: Okay.
01:13:22.982,01:13:24.692,Coffee on?
01:13:24.692,01:13:27.195,Good morning.
01:13:30.948,01:13:33.076,"Oh, hi, Louisa."
01:13:33.076,01:13:34.535,PETER: Hi.
01:13:36.704,01:13:37.955,SUZANNE: Please hold.
01:13:37.955,01:13:39.749,What's up?
01:13:39.749,01:13:41.292,SUZANNE: Wade's on 2.
01:13:41.292,01:13:42.835,Hello?
01:13:42.835,01:13:44.003,"Ed, it's Billy."
01:13:44.003,01:13:45.462,"Billy, what's up?"
01:13:45.462,01:13:47.215,"Look, I need a little help on defense."
01:13:47.215,01:13:48.591,Okay.
01:13:48.591,01:13:50.968,I'm willing to trade Jeremy Giambi for it.
01:13:50.968,01:13:52.469,Really?
01:13:52.469,01:13:54.471,Mm-hm. Who you got?
01:13:54.471,01:13:55.681,What?
01:13:55.681,01:13:56.849,"Well, let me think."
01:13:56.849,01:13:58.893,What are you doing?
01:13:58.893,01:14:00.228,Cleaning house.
01:14:00.228,01:14:02.355,Mabry?
01:14:02.355,01:14:05.649,"No, Mabry."
01:14:05.649,01:14:07.777,No.
01:14:07.777,01:14:09.904,Because you can't trade Jeremy Giambi.
01:14:11.030,01:14:12.865,"He'll be fine, Ed."
01:14:12.865,01:14:15.618,Why do I get the feeling you're picking my pocket?
01:14:15.618,01:14:17.245,I'm not.
01:14:17.245,01:14:19.038,Giambi's name alone is worth more.
01:14:19.038,01:14:21.332,What's wrong with him?
01:14:21.332,01:14:24.919,Can we say it's done in theory and start drawing up the paperwork?
01:14:24.919,01:14:27.630,"Okay, but you're gonna have-- Great."
01:14:27.630,01:14:29.465,He was gonna say something else.
01:14:29.465,01:14:32.009,"When you get the answer you're looking for, hang up."
01:14:32.009,01:14:36.013,Suzanne. David Dombrowski.
01:14:36.013,01:14:37.390,And Peña's going too.
01:14:37.390,01:14:39.100,I don't think you should do that.
01:14:39.100,01:14:41.102,I really don't think you should do that.
01:14:41.102,01:14:43.813,I want Hatteberg in the lineup tonight.
01:14:43.813,01:14:46.607,You need to take a minute.
01:14:43.813,01:14:48.567,I think you seriously need to think about what you're doing.
01:14:48.567,01:14:49.986,Because you're upset.
01:14:51.528,01:14:53.614,What am I missing?
01:14:53.614,01:14:56.617,These are hard moves to explain to people.
01:14:56.617,01:14:58.995,"Why is that a problem, Pete?"
01:15:01.705,01:15:04.125,"Don't make an emotional decision, Billy."
01:15:04.125,01:15:06.085,SUZANNE: David Dombrowski's on 3.
01:15:06.085,01:15:08.754,"Look, we're gonna shake things up."
01:15:08.754,01:15:11.924,Dave. Peña's going on the block.
01:15:11.924,01:15:16.137,Because he's making the rest of the team look bad.
01:15:16.137,01:15:18.014,He's gonna be a Rookie of the Year.
01:15:18.014,01:15:21.142,Probably an All-Star.
01:15:22.518,01:15:25.729,No. I want a reliever and cash.
01:15:25.729,01:15:29.650,"Okay. You got five minutes, Dave. I'm not waiting."
01:15:29.650,01:15:33.612,"Billy, Peña is an All-Star, okay?"
01:15:33.612,01:15:43.289,"And if you dump him and this Hatteberg thing doesn't work out, you know this is-- This is the kind of decision that gets you fired."
01:15:43.289,01:15:45.375,It is.
01:15:45.375,01:15:47.793,"BILLY: Yes, you're right."
01:15:47.793,01:15:50.671,I may lose my job.
01:15:50.671,01:15:57.594,In which case I'm a 44-year-old guy with a high school diploma and a daughter I'd like to be able to send to college.
01:15:57.594,01:16:03.184,"You're 25 years old, with a degree from Yale and a pretty impressive apprenticeship."
01:16:04.643,01:16:07.813,I don't think we're asking the right question.
01:16:07.813,01:16:13.819,"I think the question we should be asking is, do you believe in this thing or not?"
01:16:15.488,01:16:17.156,I do.
01:16:20.201,01:16:23.371,It's a problem you think we need to explain ourselves.
01:16:23.371,01:16:26.416,Don't. To anyone.
01:16:29.793,01:16:31.379,Okay.
01:16:33.964,01:16:37.468,"Now, I'm gonna see this thing through, for better or worse."
01:16:40.804,01:16:46.185,"Just tell me, do you project we'll win more with Hatteberg or Peña at first?"
01:16:46.185,01:16:52.108,"It's close but theoretically, Hatteberg."
01:16:52.108,01:16:54.610,"What are we talking about, then?"
01:16:54.610,01:16:57.738,"SUZANNE: Dombrowski's on again, on 3."
01:16:59.949,01:17:02.243,BILLY: Yeah?
01:17:02.243,01:17:04.870,"Okay, that'll work."
01:17:04.870,01:17:07.373,Great. I need one more thing.
01:17:07.373,01:17:10.834,"Soda. Yeah, I don't want my guys paying for soda."
01:17:10.834,01:17:13.129,I want you to stock my machine for three years.
01:17:13.129,01:17:15.005,I'm serious.
01:17:16.090,01:17:18.175,Great. It's a deal.
01:17:19.385,01:17:21.262,Go tell Peña he's gotta pack.
01:17:22.388,01:17:24.014,You want me to tell Peña?
01:17:24.014,01:17:25.933,Part of the job.
01:17:28.311,01:17:30.854,What about Giambi?
01:17:30.854,01:17:33.023,I'll tell him.
01:17:39.738,01:17:41.532,"Excuse me, Carlos?"
01:17:41.532,01:17:43.700,Can I speak with you a minute?
01:17:52.293,01:17:54.837,"Carlos, you've been traded to the Tigers."
01:17:58.341,01:18:00.510,This is Jay Palmer's number.
01:18:00.510,01:18:03.346,He's the traveling secretary for the team.
01:18:03.346,01:18:06.432,He's expecting your call.
01:18:15.483,01:18:18.068,Is that it?
01:18:25.159,01:18:26.743,Okay.
01:18:39.089,01:18:40.633,Okay.
01:18:43.219,01:18:44.512,"Art, you got a minute?"
01:18:47.973,01:18:51.227,Yeah. Take a seat.
01:18:54.271,01:18:56.273,You can't start Peña at first tonight.
01:18:56.273,01:18:58.067,You'll have to start Hatteberg.
01:18:59.818,01:19:01.696,"I don't wanna go 15 rounds, Billy."
01:19:01.696,01:19:04.365,"The lineup card is mine, and that's all."
01:19:04.365,01:19:06.742,BILLY: That lineup card is definitely yours.
01:19:06.742,01:19:09.453,I'm just saying you can't start Peña at first.
01:19:09.453,01:19:11.121,Well...
01:19:12.707,01:19:14.709,I am starting him at first.
01:19:14.709,01:19:16.419,BILLY: I don't think so.
01:19:16.419,01:19:18.837,He plays for Detroit now.
01:19:22.592,01:19:24.343,You traded Peña?
01:19:25.553,01:19:27.722,Yeah.
01:19:27.722,01:19:32.309,"And Menechino, Hiljus, Tam are all being sent down."
01:19:32.309,01:19:35.020,You are outside your mind.
01:19:35.020,01:19:36.564,BILLY: Yeah. Cuckoo.
01:19:38.274,01:19:41.068,You wanted to see me?
01:19:44.780,01:19:47.450,"Jeremy, you've been traded to the Phillies."
01:19:47.450,01:19:50.160,This is Ed Wade's number.
01:19:50.160,01:19:52.663,He's expecting your call.
01:19:52.663,01:19:55.374,Buddy will help you with the plane flight.
01:19:56.792,01:20:02.089,"You're a good ballplayer, Jeremy, and we wish you the best."
01:20:18.522,01:20:20.899,Jeremy's gone too.
01:20:22.652,01:20:25.070,You're killing this team.
01:20:25.070,01:20:28.865,"Art, I can do this all day long."
01:20:34.664,01:20:36.666,ART: Hey.
01:20:36.666,01:20:39.335,You agree with this?
01:20:40.503,01:20:42.254,Hundred percent.
01:20:43.756,01:20:45.466,You want this door closed?
01:20:57.812,01:21:00.564,Scotty H.
01:21:00.564,01:21:03.275,BILLY: Go field some grounders.
01:21:03.275,01:21:04.735,"Yes, sir."
01:21:04.735,01:21:07.196,"Everybody, listen up."
01:21:10.073,01:21:12.702,You may not look like a winning team...
01:21:15.996,01:21:18.123,but you are one.
01:21:22.419,01:21:24.046,So...
01:21:25.673,01:21:27.424,play like one tonight.
01:21:36.058,01:21:38.435,"Oh, shit."
01:21:41.522,01:21:44.650,"When you're getting your pitch, you're hitting .625, massive."
01:21:44.650,01:21:46.819,You're crushing the ball.
01:21:46.819,01:21:49.822,But when you swing at things-- Your pitch is middle-in.
01:21:49.822,01:21:52.908,"When you're swinging low and away, you're batting .158."
01:21:52.908,01:21:55.035,Every at bat's like a hand of blackjack.
01:21:55.035,01:21:57.621,"Every card that's dealt, your odds change."
01:21:57.621,01:22:01.917,"So every first-pitch strike, your batting average goes down about 75 points."
01:22:01.917,01:22:03.293,Seventy-five points.
01:22:03.293,01:22:05.629,He should throw 100 pitches before the fifth.
01:22:05.629,01:22:07.923,You wanna knock that starter out.
01:22:07.923,01:22:11.594,I want you taking at bats off the 10th and 11th pitcher by the end.
01:22:11.594,01:22:16.599,"This is your basic breakdown of the pitches, where you should be hitting them, why."
01:22:16.599,01:22:20.143,So you want us to walk more?
01:22:21.270,01:22:23.606,Mr. Justice.
01:22:23.606,01:22:25.691,Had a few thoughts.
01:22:25.691,01:22:27.359,Yeah.
01:22:28.652,01:22:30.195,Excuse me?
01:22:31.906,01:22:34.366,Never seen a GM talk to players like that.
01:22:34.366,01:22:37.160,You never seen a GM who was a player.
01:22:38.537,01:22:39.830,Huh.
01:22:43.333,01:22:46.295,"We got a problem, David?"
01:22:46.295,01:22:48.547,I know your routine.
01:22:48.547,01:22:50.966,It's patter. It's for effect.
01:22:52.468,01:22:55.638,"But it's for them, all right?"
01:22:55.638,01:22:57.473,That shit ain't for me.
01:22:57.473,01:22:59.683,"Oh, you're special?"
01:23:02.102,01:23:09.318,"You're paying me 7 million bucks a year, man, so, yeah, maybe I am, a little bit."
01:23:09.318,01:23:13.113,"No, man, I ain't paying you 7."
01:23:13.113,01:23:15.115,Yankees are paying half your salary.
01:23:15.115,01:23:18.661,That's what the New York Yankees think of you.
01:23:18.661,01:23:22.665,They're paying you $3.5 million to play against them.
01:23:24.249,01:23:26.794,"Where you going with this, Billy?"
01:23:26.794,01:23:29.880,"David, you're 37."
01:23:29.880,01:23:33.717,How about you and I be honest about what each of us want out of this?
01:23:35.302,01:23:38.889,I wanna milk the last ounce of baseball you got in you.
01:23:38.889,01:23:41.266,And you wanna stay in the show.
01:23:41.266,01:23:43.101,Let's do that.
01:23:44.895,01:23:47.314,I'm not paying you for the player you used to be.
01:23:47.314,01:23:50.317,I'm paying you for the player you are right now.
01:23:50.317,01:23:53.946,You're smart. You get what we're trying to do here.
01:23:53.946,01:23:56.907,Make an example for the younger guys.
01:23:56.907,01:23:59.326,Be a leader.
01:23:59.326,01:24:01.495,Can you do that?
01:24:08.002,01:24:11.296,All right. I got you.
01:24:13.590,01:24:15.425,We're cool?
01:24:17.302,01:24:18.721,We're cool.
01:24:24.100,01:24:25.561,Scotty H.
01:24:25.561,01:24:27.688,"Yo, what's up, D.J.?"
01:24:28.898,01:24:32.484,"How you liking first base, man?"
01:24:32.484,01:24:35.863,It's coming along.
01:24:35.863,01:24:40.200,"You know, tough transition, but I'm starting to feel better with it."
01:24:40.200,01:24:42.411,Yeah?
01:24:42.411,01:24:44.538,What's your biggest fear?
01:24:44.538,01:24:47.123,A baseball being hit in my general direction.
01:24:49.710,01:24:52.922,That's funny.
01:24:56.258,01:24:58.719,"No, seriously, that is."
01:25:09.396,01:25:11.982,"Well, hey, good luck with that."
01:25:11.982,01:25:14.443,Be social out there.
01:25:14.443,01:25:15.736,Social.
01:25:15.736,01:25:17.863,Social.
01:25:17.863,01:25:19.949,"Guy steps into your office, chat him up."
01:25:19.949,01:25:22.743,You're well-read.
01:25:22.743,01:25:25.245,Yeah.
01:25:25.245,01:25:28.331,Everyone wants to attack.
01:25:28.331,01:25:31.334,"Let the game come to you, man."
01:25:31.334,01:25:33.336,This is a war of attrition.
01:25:33.336,01:25:37.841,"If I take more, I could even take a few strikes, but I'll get walked more."
01:25:37.841,01:25:41.762,"You get on base, we win."
01:25:41.762,01:25:45.223,"And I hate losing, Chavvie. I hate it."
01:25:45.223,01:25:47.977,I hate losing more than I even wanna win.
01:25:47.977,01:25:49.478,And there's a difference.
01:25:49.478,01:25:51.229,No bunts.
01:25:51.229,01:25:52.940,Even if the third baseman is back?
01:25:52.940,01:25:54.650,No bunting whatsoever.
01:25:54.650,01:25:57.694,"If someone bunts on us, throw it to first."
01:25:57.694,01:25:59.404,Don't be a hero and go to second.
01:25:59.404,01:26:00.781,Let them make the mistakes.
01:26:00.781,01:26:04.200,"When your enemy's making mistakes, don't interrupt them."
01:26:04.200,01:26:06.662,They're giving you an out.
01:26:06.662,01:26:08.246,Take it.
01:26:08.246,01:26:10.499,Another thing.
01:26:10.499,01:26:12.835,"That's what I do, what you pay me to do."
01:26:12.835,01:26:15.796,"I pay you to get on first, not get thrown out at second."
01:26:15.796,01:26:17.006,This is a process.
01:26:17.006,01:26:20.759,"It's a process, it's a process. Okay?"
01:26:32.521,01:26:37.026,"ANNOUNCER 1: Jason takes it, goes to second for the only out, and the A's get a run."
01:26:38.568,01:26:42.781,"ANNOUNCER 2: Jermaine Dye homers again, his second in two games."
01:26:42.781,01:26:45.492,And the A's are still hanging in.
01:26:45.492,01:26:47.661,We'll get you scores here.
01:26:47.661,01:26:51.540,The A's pull within two of the Angels for the wild-card chase.
01:26:51.540,01:26:58.130,ANNOUNCER 3: The Reds have now dropped five in a row as Oakland beats them in the beginning of this series 5 to 3.
01:26:58.130,01:27:00.966,ANNOUNCER 2: Tejada walks. Ball four.
01:27:00.966,01:27:04.761,ANNOUNCER 4: Ball four and Hatteberg walks.
01:27:04.761,01:27:06.847,ANNOUNCER 5: What is happening in Oakland?
01:27:06.847,01:27:08.932,The A's have won seven in a row.
01:27:08.932,01:27:11.309,A lot of excitement.
01:27:11.309,01:27:13.937,But how about the calming influence of Art Howe?
01:27:13.937,01:27:17.816,"When you say your source, if it's not me or Peter, they don't know."
01:27:17.816,01:27:20.443,ANNOUNCER 5: He's managing an unorthodox team.
01:27:20.443,01:27:23.446,BILLY: Right.
01:27:23.446,01:27:25.866,But Art Howe is the reason this team is winning.
01:27:25.866,01:27:28.160,He deserves the credit.
01:27:28.160,01:27:30.162,Did you hear that?
01:27:30.162,01:27:33.165,I heard seven in a row.
01:27:33.165,01:27:35.125,"Yeah, right here."
01:27:42.632,01:27:44.593,Voos.
01:27:44.593,01:27:46.011,That smell is getting worse.
01:27:46.011,01:27:48.471,VOOS: I'm on it.
01:27:48.471,01:27:50.599,What are we doing?
01:27:50.599,01:27:53.268,Both sides of the plate.
01:27:53.268,01:27:55.812,Huddy. Mix it up.
01:27:55.812,01:27:58.065,"Trust your slider, yeah?"
01:27:58.065,01:28:00.358,You guys quit distracting him.
01:28:00.358,01:28:03.070,You couldn't hit that shit last night with a paddle.
01:28:03.070,01:28:05.155,You gotta see more pitches.
01:28:05.155,01:28:08.617,"All right, Billy."
01:28:11.369,01:28:13.329,"Hey, David."
01:28:13.329,01:28:16.250,BILLY: Great at bats. Really quality.
01:28:16.250,01:28:19.211,Base hit to right field.
01:28:19.211,01:28:22.338,Chavez coming in.
01:28:22.338,01:28:27.302,"The A's, from 5-nothing down, now lead 6 to 5."
01:28:36.812,01:28:40.232,ANNOUNCER 2: The Oakland A's are completely out of hand at the moment.
01:28:40.232,01:28:43.110,They are an AL-best 17 and 4 this month.
01:28:43.110,01:28:47.197,They also took back-to-back series at Boston and at New York.
01:28:47.197,01:28:52.494,Remember when they traded Jeremy Giambi in June and everyone thought they'd just given up?
01:28:52.494,01:28:55.289,"Actually, not so much."
01:28:59.168,01:29:01.920,"BILLY: Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone."
01:29:01.920,01:29:03.839,You thinking Rincon?
01:29:03.839,01:29:05.841,His season's done.
01:29:05.841,01:29:08.802,I think he's gonna dump him.
01:29:08.802,01:29:11.096,SUZANNE: Shapiro on 2.
01:29:12.681,01:29:14.766,"Mark, Billy. Let's be honest."
01:29:14.766,01:29:17.811,A premier setup man isn't gonna get you closer to the play-offs.
01:29:17.811,01:29:20.355,Are you referring to Rincon?
01:29:20.355,01:29:22.398,"He's a luxury you can't afford, man."
01:29:22.398,01:29:25.235,And you can? There's half a million on his contract.
01:29:25.235,01:29:27.529,And we've got at least one other suitor.
01:29:27.529,01:29:30.282,"By at least one, you mean one."
01:29:30.282,01:29:32.993,Who is it?
01:29:32.993,01:29:35.453,San Francisco.
01:29:35.453,01:29:36.955,I'll call you back.
01:29:38.623,01:29:40.583,What do you think we can get for Magnante?
01:29:40.583,01:29:43.253,Nothing.
01:29:43.253,01:29:45.255,What's left on Venafro's contract?
01:29:45.255,01:29:47.174,Two seventy-five.
01:29:47.174,01:29:49.176,"Suzanne, get me Sabean on the line."
01:29:49.176,01:29:53.013,"Get the Giants interested in Venafro, Mark's only got one buyer for Rincon."
01:29:53.013,01:29:54.764,Us.
01:29:56.975,01:30:00.520,"Saby-Sabster, it's Billy."
01:30:00.520,01:30:02.772,I can let you have him for almost nothing.
01:30:02.772,01:30:05.608,SABEAN: Why would you do that?
01:30:05.608,01:30:07.986,I want a couple bucks and a sweetener.
01:30:07.986,01:30:09.946,"Throw in, say..."
01:30:09.946,01:30:12.366,Anderson.
01:30:12.366,01:30:15.493,I like Anderson.
01:30:15.493,01:30:18.121,I don't know why I'm doing this.
01:30:18.121,01:30:19.956,Venafro for Michaelson.
01:30:19.956,01:30:21.499,I don't know his name.
01:30:21.499,01:30:24.669,I'll think about it.
01:30:24.669,01:30:26.629,Get Shapiro on.
01:30:34.554,01:30:36.765,SUZANNE: Shapiro's on 2.
01:30:38.808,01:30:40.810,Mark.
01:30:40.810,01:30:42.354,You sure about that?
01:30:42.354,01:30:44.940,I get the impression the market for Rincon is softening.
01:30:44.940,01:30:46.733,Huh?
01:30:44.940,01:30:53.073,"I could be wrong, but I'd call whoever's interested and see if they're still interested. Call me back."
01:30:53.073,01:30:56.285,What about the Mets for Venafro?
01:30:56.285,01:30:58.412,"Suzanne, Steve Phillips."
01:30:58.412,01:31:03.625,"Between Bonds, Kent, Nen, Snow, San Francisco's never gonna do it."
01:31:03.625,01:31:04.876,Totally agree.
01:31:04.876,01:31:07.587,We just need them to cool on Rincon.
01:31:07.587,01:31:10.840,SUZANNE: Phillips on 2.
01:31:10.840,01:31:12.842,I hear you're looking for a reliever.
01:31:12.842,01:31:14.719,I can give you Venafro.
01:31:14.719,01:31:17.639,I can make it quick and easy.
01:31:17.639,01:31:21.059,No angle.
01:31:21.059,01:31:24.562,Hang on a sec.
01:31:24.562,01:31:26.189,How old?
01:31:26.189,01:31:28.358,"Twenty-six, Double-A? Forget it."
01:31:28.358,01:31:30.444,"Duncan, no."
01:31:32.279,01:31:34.072,"No. Furbush, no."
01:31:36.699,01:31:41.246,Eckerton? Eckerton? Eckerton.
01:31:41.246,01:31:43.123,Eckerton.
01:31:43.123,01:31:45.083,You don't even know who Eckerton is.
01:31:45.083,01:31:46.918,Is Venafro hurt?
01:31:46.918,01:31:49.087,"No, he's fine, he's fine."
01:31:49.087,01:31:50.339,It's just an issue for us.
01:31:50.339,01:31:52.257,"Last couple times, he got hammered."
01:31:52.257,01:31:53.467,Not his fault.
01:31:53.467,01:31:55.551,That was us. We misused him.
01:31:55.551,01:31:58.221,I'm almost done. Steve Schott.
01:31:58.221,01:32:01.308,"Look, Steve-o, let me be straight with you."
01:32:01.308,01:32:04.144,Here's the deal. I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal.
01:32:04.144,01:32:07.521,I heard the Giants-- Giants want Venafro for Michaelson.
01:32:07.521,01:32:09.649,Anderson.
01:32:09.649,01:32:15.613,"You can give me Eckerton and $225,000 in cash, and the Giants can't."
01:32:15.613,01:32:17.949,I'll think about it.
01:32:17.949,01:32:20.327,But whoever calls me back first gets Venafro.
01:32:22.662,01:32:23.955,Schott hung up.
01:32:25.374,01:32:28.626,"Oh, I want this one."
01:32:36.634,01:32:38.928,Why isn't anybody calling?
01:32:41.723,01:32:43.933,SUZANNE: Shapiro's on 2.
01:32:45.268,01:32:46.728,Yeah?
01:32:50.940,01:32:53.776,"Okay, let me talk to my owner."
01:32:53.776,01:32:56.654,Get Steve on the phone.
01:32:56.654,01:32:59.408,Why would we call Phillips?
01:33:03.328,01:33:05.163,Tell him I'm on the other line.
01:33:08.833,01:33:10.668,"Hi, Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand."
01:33:10.668,01:33:12.670,I apologize for putting you on hold.
01:33:12.670,01:33:14.381,Billy asked me to call you back.
01:33:14.381,01:33:17.759,"Tell him we want 225,000 for Rincon."
01:33:17.759,01:33:23.181,"Billy says he needs $225,000 for Ricardo Rincon."
01:33:23.181,01:33:24.807,Please.
01:33:26.393,01:33:29.603,"Yes, I added the please at the end."
01:33:31.064,01:33:35.068,"Okay. Let me-- Hold on one second, please."
01:33:35.068,01:33:37.362,Tell him I'll pay for him.
01:33:37.362,01:33:41.533,"But when I sell him back for twice the amount next year, I keep the money."
01:33:43.577,01:33:46.746,"Okay, so Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself."
01:33:46.746,01:33:51.042,"But when he sells him for more money next year, he's keeping the profit."
01:34:00.969,01:34:03.930,Thank you very much.
01:34:03.930,01:34:06.433,Come on. Come on.
01:34:11.062,01:34:15.400,"Suzanne, call Shapiro ba-- Never mind, I got him right here."
01:34:18.153,01:34:20.280,Mark. Yeah.
01:34:20.280,01:34:23.199,"Listen, I don't want Rincon pitching against me tonight."
01:34:23.199,01:34:25.494,Tell him to change clothes and send him over.
01:34:25.494,01:34:28.455,I got you the money. Yup.
01:34:28.455,01:34:29.914,Great.
01:34:34.043,01:34:38.298,"I don't wanna dampen the mood at all, but since we picked up Rincon..."
01:34:38.298,01:34:40.592,We gotta send someone down.
01:34:47.182,01:34:50.226,BILLY: Mags.
01:34:53.188,01:34:55.273,I know I've been struggling lately.
01:34:55.273,01:34:59.235,"But second half of the season, definitely turn it around."
01:34:56.941,01:35:03.281,"Ricky and I-- Mike, I need you to stop getting dressed."
01:35:05.659,01:35:07.285,Traded?
01:35:18.129,01:35:21.341,I'm sorry for the crap news.
01:35:21.341,01:35:23.343,I know it hurts.
01:35:33.562,01:35:36.481,"Mike, I can't have 26 guys in the clubhouse."
01:35:36.481,01:35:39.401,I get it. I get it.
01:35:40.610,01:35:43.863,Okay. Thanks.
01:35:58.086,01:35:59.588,"Hey, Ricardo."
01:36:01.631,01:36:04.426,"This must be a bit of a shock, I guess."
01:36:04.426,01:36:07.387,ANNOUNCER 1: Mabry hits one deep to right-center field.
01:36:07.387,01:36:09.639,"Racing back, Fick can't get it."
01:36:09.639,01:36:13.602,It bounces to the wall.
01:36:13.602,01:36:17.021,"Mabry, on one pitch, has shot the A's in front."
01:36:17.021,01:36:18.898,Strike three called.
01:36:18.898,01:36:21.568,Twelve straight wins for the Athletics.
01:36:21.568,01:36:23.319,"Man alive, was it hairy."
01:36:23.319,01:36:26.197,ANNOUNCER 2: Something strange is happening in Oakland.
01:36:26.197,01:36:28.283,ANNOUNCER 1: Twelve straight.
01:36:28.283,01:36:31.745,ANNOUNCER 3: They're making a joke out of the American League.
01:36:31.745,01:36:34.788,They were in Detroit today-- ANNOUNCER 1: He throws to first.
01:36:34.788,01:36:37.833,And that's the sound of 14 straight victories.
01:36:37.833,01:36:40.002,"Fourteen, the longest run this year."
01:36:40.002,01:36:42.880,It has slingshot the A's into first in the AL West.
01:36:42.880,01:36:45.133,ANNOUNCER 4: This team was written off.
01:36:45.133,01:36:48.844,"How do you explain, otherwise, the victories they've come up with?"
01:36:48.844,01:36:52.557,ANNOUNCER 5: The Oakland A's are gonna win 16 consecutive games.
01:36:54.016,01:36:59.731,"This is the longest win streak in baseball, folks, in 25 years."
01:36:59.731,01:37:01.566,The A's have won 16 in a row.
01:37:01.566,01:37:04.360,CALLER 1: We're going to 20!
01:37:04.360,01:37:11.993,"ANNOUNCER 6: To have a winning streak of this duration, you have to be good, but there's an element of randomness to it."
01:37:11.993,01:37:17.749,"The 1927 Yankees, Ruth, Gehrig, Murderers' Row, some people still say the best team ever."
01:37:17.749,01:37:21.377,Longest winning streak for them that year? Nine.
01:37:21.377,01:37:24.506,CALLER 2: You guys try to analyze it from a numbers standpoint.
01:37:24.506,01:37:28.259,"I'm telling you, there is no explanation for what's occurring."
01:37:28.259,01:37:31.095,INTERVIEWER: Do you have superstitions going on?
01:37:31.095,01:37:33.431,Do you do things so you keep the streak alive?
01:37:33.431,01:37:37.059,ANNOUNCER 7: The all-time record of 20 does not seem impossible anymore.
01:37:37.059,01:37:40.104,ANNOUNCER 8: The A's were on page one of the New York Times.
01:37:40.104,01:37:43.065,They are the story in sports in this entire country.
01:37:43.065,01:37:45.985,"ANNOUNCER 9: Two-two pitch, here it is."
01:37:45.985,01:37:48.780,Struck him out! Number 17!
01:37:48.780,01:37:51.907,It's taken 71 years.
01:37:51.907,01:37:54.994,The Oakland A's have tied the Philadelphia A's.
01:37:54.994,01:38:04.546,The all-time franchise record 17 straight and baseball's longest winning streak since 1953.
01:38:04.546,01:38:08.633,ANNOUNCER 10: The A's are two wins away from tying the American League record.
01:38:08.633,01:38:11.135,ANNOUNCER 5: It's gone! It's gone!
01:38:11.135,01:38:14.806,Tejada wins it!
01:38:14.806,01:38:17.225,Eighteen wins in a row!
01:38:17.225,01:38:20.562,ANNOUNCER 6: You could replay these 18 games a hundred times over.
01:38:20.562,01:38:22.271,And nobody wins 18 straight again.
01:38:22.271,01:38:25.107,It defies everything we know about baseball.
01:38:25.107,01:38:31.989,ANNOUNCER 10: The most amazing thing you could imagine happened over the last four days at the Coliseum.
01:38:31.989,01:38:38.371,"ANNOUNCER 5: Tejada, up the middle."
01:38:38.371,01:38:45.294,"ANNOUNCER 10: The 1906 White Sox, the 1947 New York Yankees have company."
01:38:46.379,01:38:48.005,Nineteen in a row.
01:38:48.005,01:38:51.175,ANNOUNCER 11: The A's have a date with destiny.
01:38:51.175,01:38:55.430,"They're going for the all-time American League record, 20 games in a row."
01:38:55.430,01:38:56.972,CALLER 1: We're going to 20!
01:38:56.972,01:39:00.059,"We're gonna take the AL record to 20, baby!"
01:39:02.812,01:39:04.856,"BILLY: Don't tell me the score, Pete."
01:39:04.856,01:39:06.733,"No, it's me."
01:39:06.733,01:39:08.651,Sharon?
01:39:09.861,01:39:13.197,You have a second?
01:39:13.197,01:39:15.784,"Well, I didn't actually expect you to pick up."
01:39:15.784,01:39:17.786,I was gonna leave a message.
01:39:17.786,01:39:21.748,"Um, Casey and I, we're here and watching the game at home."
01:39:21.748,01:39:25.376,And I just wanted to say...
01:39:26.711,01:39:28.630,"you did good, Billy."
01:39:28.630,01:39:30.673,We're really proud of you.
01:39:32.258,01:39:34.636,"I appreciate it, Sharon."
01:39:34.636,01:39:38.180,Thank you.
01:39:38.180,01:39:39.641,Okay.
01:39:39.641,01:39:42.393,"Oh, Casey wants to talk to you. Hang on."
01:39:42.393,01:39:44.729,CASEY: Are you on your way to the stadium?
01:39:44.729,01:39:47.857,"No, I'm on my way to Visalia to see our minor-league team."
01:39:47.857,01:39:50.860,"Turn around, please, Dad."
01:39:50.860,01:39:53.613,"Turn around. Come on, Dad."
01:39:53.613,01:39:55.239,You're not gonna jinx it.
01:39:55.239,01:39:59.034,"I'll talk to you later, sweetheart. I love you."
01:40:05.166,01:40:06.876,Shit.
01:40:06.876,01:40:11.714,"One out here in the fourth, and if you're just joining us, you missed a lot."
01:40:11.714,01:40:14.425,And the pitch to Raúl Ibañez.
01:40:14.425,01:40:16.385,ANNOUNCER 2: My recap will be simple.
01:40:16.385,01:40:20.723,"The A's scored six in the first, one in the second, four in the third."
01:40:20.723,01:40:23.893,ANNOUNCER 1: And people would be shocked if you just did that.
01:40:23.893,01:40:26.395,"Eleven to nothing, the A's do lead."
01:40:26.395,01:40:29.106,Shit.
01:40:51.504,01:40:54.298,"Let's go, Oakland!"
01:40:54.298,01:40:57.010,"Let's go, Oakland!"
01:40:57.010,01:40:59.846,"Let's go, Oakland!"
01:41:05.267,01:41:11.273,"Now batting, number 2, catcher, Brent Mayne."
01:41:15.528,01:41:19.365,MAN 1: Oakland!
01:41:27.916,01:41:29.542,PLAYER: Two.
01:41:31.126,01:41:32.837,UMPIRE: Safe.
01:41:38.217,01:41:45.474,"Now batting, number 18, left fielder Raúl Ibañez."
01:42:46.619,01:42:48.245,Safe.
01:42:50.665,01:42:53.459,The A's lead by a score of 11 to 3.
01:42:53.459,01:43:45.594,"ANNOUNCER 3: A cushion, but you don't wanna give teams life and let them wedge their way back in, even when-- ANNOUNCER 3: Nobody out, the bases loaded."
01:43:45.594,01:43:48.430,Art Howe on the way to the mound to make a pitching change.
01:43:48.430,01:43:53.352,And this game is still in a state where it could get out of control for the Athletics.
01:43:59.942,01:44:04.155,JONGEWAARD: We're all told at some point we can no longer play the children's game.
01:44:04.155,01:44:06.448,We just don't know when that's gonna be.
01:44:10.619,01:44:16.042,"Some of us are told at 18, some of us are told at 40, but we're all told."
01:44:16.042,01:44:19.045,ANNOUNCER 3: Mike Sweeney with runners at first and third.
01:44:19.045,01:44:21.296,"It's an 11-to-7 game, the A's in front."
01:44:21.296,01:44:24.133,Tam peering in for the sign.
01:44:24.133,01:44:27.302,Two out.
01:44:27.302,01:44:29.764,And the 3-2 delivery.
01:45:03.422,01:45:06.008,"MAN: It's weird, Billy."
01:45:06.008,01:45:10.096,You wanna give up baseball to become a scout?
01:45:11.388,01:45:14.183,BILLY: I'm not a baseball player.
01:45:14.183,01:45:16.727,MAN: Are you sure this is what you want?
01:45:18.062,01:45:20.439,ANNOUNCER 3: The crowd is roaring.
01:45:20.439,01:45:23.109,Koch is ready. One-two pitch.
01:45:23.109,01:45:26.445,"Alicea puts it in play, a looper to left field for a base hit."
01:45:26.445,01:45:30.241,"Around third, tearing for the plate, here comes the tying run."
01:45:30.241,01:45:34.287,Sliding safe. And the ball game is tied at 11-all.
01:45:34.287,01:45:35.997,Holy Toledo.
01:45:37.414,01:45:41.543,The A's have blown an 11-to-nothing lead.
01:45:43.254,01:45:52.180,This is the specter of a development that has been lurking now ever since the five-run fourth inning by the Royals.
01:45:52.180,01:45:57.559,And the A's date with destiny is on hold right now.
01:46:23.211,01:46:27.256,ART: Hatteberg. Hattie.
01:46:27.256,01:46:29.550,Grab a bat.
01:46:30.968,01:46:34.305,"Come on, let's go."
01:46:44.732,01:46:52.865,"Hitting for Eric Byrnes, number 10, Scott Hatteberg."
01:47:00.956,01:47:03.209,ANNOUNCER 3: In your typical A's fashion.
01:47:03.209,01:47:04.793,They want a base runner here.
01:47:04.793,01:47:08.547,Scott Hatteberg is so adept at drawing walks.
01:47:11.717,01:47:16.305,"He's looking for Hatteberg to get on base, maybe bring in a pinch runner."
01:47:16.305,01:47:18.891,"Let's go, Oakland!"
01:47:18.891,01:47:21.102,"Let's go, Oakland!"
01:48:15.823,01:48:17.825,ANNOUNCER 3: That one is gone!
01:48:17.825,01:48:29.128,And it's 20 consecutive victories for the Oakland Athletics on an unbelievable night when they lost an 11-to-nothing lead and now they win it.
01:48:31.130,01:48:35.759,The crowd comes back to insane life.
01:48:37.594,01:48:40.513,How do you explain it?
01:48:40.513,01:48:44.893,Crazy. Just plain crazy.
01:48:48.939,01:48:52.525,Hatteberg is mobbed at home plate.
01:48:55.779,01:49:02.535,"In 103 years of American League baseball, the Athletics have accomplished what no one has before."
01:49:02.535,01:49:06.999,They have won 20 consecutive games.
01:49:32.733,01:49:35.694,BILLY: It's hard not to be romantic about baseball.
01:49:37.488,01:49:41.658,"This kind of thing, it's fun for the fans."
01:49:41.658,01:49:45.079,It sells tickets and hot dogs.
01:49:46.372,01:49:48.040,Doesn't mean anything.
01:49:48.040,01:49:51.877,"PETER: Billy, we just won 20 games in a row."
01:49:53.546,01:49:55.756,And what's the point?
01:49:55.756,01:49:58.384,PETER: We just got the record.
01:50:01.262,01:50:03.680,"Man, I've been doing this for..."
01:50:09.644,01:50:11.897,"Listen, man."
01:50:11.897,01:50:15.359,I've been in this game a long time.
01:50:17.069,01:50:19.947,"I'm not in it for a record, I'll tell you that."
01:50:19.947,01:50:22.032,I'm not in it for a ring.
01:50:24.701,01:50:26.954,That's when people get hurt.
01:50:28.621,01:50:35.379,"If we don't win the last game of the Series, they'll dismiss us."
01:50:35.379,01:50:37.047,Billy-- I know these guys.
01:50:37.047,01:50:39.967,"I know the way they think, and they will erase us."
01:50:41.343,01:50:46.056,"And everything we've done here, none of it'll matter."
01:50:49.101,01:50:52.396,"Any other team wins the World Series, good for them."
01:50:53.772,01:50:56.984,"They're drinking champagne, they get a ring."
01:50:56.984,01:51:02.197,"But if we win, on our budget, with this team..."
01:51:06.076,01:51:08.912,we'll have changed the game.
01:51:08.912,01:51:11.248,And that's what I want.
01:51:11.248,01:51:13.584,I want it to mean something.
01:51:23.135,01:51:27.055,ANNOUNCER 1: The A's going to the play-offs with the West Division title.
01:51:27.055,01:51:30.309,ANNOUNCER 2: Forgive the A's if they're not celebrating.
01:51:30.309,01:51:38.484,"They have been here before, when Oakland went up two games to none on the Yanks in the ALDS, and went nowhere after losing three straight."
01:51:38.484,01:51:44.365,"With a win today over the Twins, Oakland moves into the ALCS for the first time since 1992."
01:51:44.365,01:51:46.367,ANNOUNCER 3: But remember one thing.
01:51:46.367,01:51:53.499,"Percentages hold up over a season, but for one game, one at bat, throw the percentages out the window."
01:52:26.073,01:52:34.789,ANNOUNCER 4: What the Minnesota Twins exposed is the fact that the Oakland A's were fundamentally not a sound baseball team.
01:52:34.789,01:52:42.089,They had a flawed concept that started with the general manager and the brain trust thinking they could reinvent baseball.
01:52:42.089,01:52:46.719,"You can't approach baseball from a statistical, bean-counting point of view."
01:52:46.719,01:52:49.221,It's won on the field with fundamental play.
01:52:49.221,01:52:52.307,"You have to steal, you have to bunt, you have to sacrifice."
01:52:52.307,01:52:56.228,"You gotta get men in scoring position, and you gotta bring them in."
01:52:56.228,01:53:00.733,And you don't do that with a bunch of statistical gimmicks.
01:53:00.733,01:53:03.652,Nobody reinvents this game.
01:53:46.779,01:53:48.238,Yeah.
01:54:56.849,01:55:02.437,"HENRY: Due respect to the Coliseum, but this is a ballpark."
01:55:02.437,01:55:04.648,"BILLY: Yes, it is."
01:55:06.650,01:55:09.027,We're gonna have some lunch in a little bit.
01:55:09.027,01:55:11.864,Why don't I have some coffee sent up?
01:55:11.864,01:55:13.657,Denise?
01:55:18.286,01:55:20.330,"HENRY: Thank you, Denise."
01:55:20.330,01:55:22.374,BILLY: Thanks.
01:55:25.460,01:55:32.843,"You know, it's her birthday and I need to get her a present, but she's usually the one that does that for me."
01:55:32.843,01:55:35.679,So do you have any ideas?
01:55:35.679,01:55:37.264,Scarf.
01:55:37.264,01:55:39.015,You mean like wool?
01:55:39.015,01:55:44.062,"No, I meant what women wear with... You know, decorative."
01:55:44.062,01:55:47.941,Ah. And where would I get something like that?
01:55:47.941,01:55:51.737,"No disrespect, I just lost in five for the second year in a row."
01:55:51.737,01:55:53.906,Get her a bowling ball for all I care.
01:55:53.906,01:55:56.366,Right.
01:55:56.366,01:55:59.870,"Well, Steve told me he's offering you a new contract."
01:56:01.204,01:56:03.206,Yes.
01:56:03.206,01:56:05.834,So why did you return my call?
01:56:07.961,01:56:10.756,Because it's the Red Sox.
01:56:10.756,01:56:15.928,Because I believe science might offer an answer to the Curse of the Bambino.
01:56:15.928,01:56:19.514,Because I hear you hired Bill James.
01:56:19.514,01:56:21.433,Yup.
01:56:21.433,01:56:27.063,"You know, why someone took so long to hire that guy is beyond me."
01:56:27.063,01:56:29.983,"Well, baseball hates him."
01:56:29.983,01:56:34.905,"Well, baseball can hate him, you know."
01:56:34.905,01:56:45.707,"One of the great things about money is that it buys a lot of things, one of which is the luxury to disregard what baseball likes, doesn't like, what baseball thinks, doesn't think."
01:56:47.167,01:56:50.462,Ah. Sounds nice.
01:56:50.462,01:56:52.589,Well...
01:56:52.589,01:56:54.800,I was grateful for the call.
01:56:54.800,01:56:56.760,You were grateful?
01:56:59.930,01:57:04.100,"For 41 million, you built a play-off team."
01:57:04.100,01:57:12.484,"You lost Damon, Giambi, Isringhausen, Peña, and you won more games without them than you did with them."
01:57:12.484,01:57:23.620,"You won the exact same number of games that the Yankees won, but the Yankees spent 1.4 million per win, and you paid 260,000."
01:57:23.620,01:57:30.585,"I know you're taking it in the teeth, but the first guy through the wall, he always gets bloody."
01:57:30.585,01:57:36.842,"Always. This is threatening not just a way of doing business, but in their minds, it's threatening the game."
01:57:36.842,01:57:40.220,"Really, what it's threatening is their livelihood, their jobs."
01:57:40.220,01:57:43.390,It's threatening the way that they do things.
01:57:43.390,01:57:56.444,"Every time that happens, whether it's a government, a way of doing business, whatever, the people who are holding the reins, they have their hands on the switch, they go batshit crazy."
01:57:57.571,01:58:09.041,"I mean, anybody who's not tearing their team down right now and rebuilding it using your model, they're dinosaurs."
01:58:09.041,01:58:17.049,They'll be sitting on their ass on the sofa in October watching the Boston Red Sox win the World Series.
01:58:22.387,01:58:24.598,What's this?
01:58:24.598,01:58:27.976,I want you to be my general manager. That's my offer.
01:59:14.898,01:59:16.399,PETER: Heads up.
01:59:18.068,01:59:19.235,What was that?
01:59:20.570,01:59:23.615,Sorry. I don't know.
01:59:23.615,01:59:26.409,You knucklehead.
01:59:33.959,01:59:35.418,How was Boston?
01:59:36.837,01:59:38.797,Impressive.
01:59:45.219,01:59:47.764,"Did Henry make you a good offer, at least?"
01:59:49.432,01:59:52.560,Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
01:59:52.560,01:59:54.187,Doesn't matter.
02:00:17.335,02:00:20.714,That makes you the highest-paid GM in the history of sports.
02:00:23.091,02:00:24.592,So?
02:00:26.386,02:00:27.762,So what?
02:00:30.765,02:00:33.351,I made one decision in my life based on money.
02:00:33.351,02:00:36.229,And I swore I would never do it again.
02:00:38.857,02:00:41.317,You're not doing it for the money.
02:00:41.317,02:00:43.987,No?
02:00:45.947,02:00:48.408,You're doing it for what the money says.
02:00:50.077,02:00:54.206,And it says what it says to any player that makes big money.
02:00:54.206,02:00:55.999,That they're worth it.
02:01:04.465,02:01:06.218,What a dump.
02:01:10.430,02:01:12.724,I really wanted to win here.
02:01:16.728,02:01:19.397,I really did.
02:01:21.816,02:01:24.778,"I think you won pretty big, Billy."
02:01:24.778,02:01:26.905,"Pete, we lost."
02:01:28.489,02:01:31.284,We lost.
02:01:31.284,02:01:33.578,It's only been a few days.
02:01:31.284,02:01:34.996,Give yourself some time to get over it.
02:01:34.996,02:01:38.374,"Man, I don't get over these things."
02:01:38.374,02:01:39.500,Ever.
02:01:46.633,02:01:50.303,Come with me to the video room.
02:01:51.930,02:01:55.225,"No, man, I'm not up for film right now."
02:01:56.476,02:01:58.728,Come on. Seriously.
02:01:58.728,02:02:00.897,"Come on, Billy."
02:02:02.565,02:02:10.698,"PETER: The Visalia Oaks and our 240-pound catcher, Jeremy Brown, who, as you know, is scared to run to second base."
02:02:10.698,02:02:13.076,This was in a game six weeks ago.
02:02:13.076,02:02:15.411,This guy's gonna start with a fastball.
02:02:15.411,02:02:17.789,Jeremy's gonna take him to deep center.
02:02:19.958,02:02:24.671,"Here's what's interesting, because Jeremy's gonna do what he never does."
02:02:24.671,02:02:26.173,He's gonna go for it.
02:02:26.173,02:02:29.342,He's gonna round first and he's gonna go for it.
02:02:30.551,02:02:31.928,Okay?
02:02:35.223,02:02:39.060,This is all of Jeremy's nightmares coming to life.
02:02:41.062,02:02:43.898,"Aw, they're laughing at him."
02:02:43.898,02:02:46.067,And Jeremy's about to find out why.
02:02:49.196,02:02:56.119,Jeremy's about to realize that the ball went 60 feet over the fence.
02:02:58.788,02:03:02.458,He hit a home run and didn't even realize it.
02:03:32.530,02:03:35.408,How can you not be romantic about baseball?
02:03:40.372,02:03:43.250,It's a metaphor.
02:03:47.921,02:03:49.339,Okay.
02:03:53.426,02:03:56.429,"Pete, you're a good egg."
02:03:59.849,02:04:01.601,I'll call you.
02:05:01.995,02:05:06.166,"Hey, Dad, this is the song I told you I'd record."
02:05:06.166,02:05:09.210,Please don't show it to anyone else.
02:05:09.210,02:05:12.297,Let me know if you change your mind and stay in California.
02:05:12.297,02:05:15.425,"If not, you're a really great dad."
