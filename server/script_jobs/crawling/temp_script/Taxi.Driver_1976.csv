00:03:13.027,00:03:14.736,Are you gonna break my chops?
00:03:14.736,00:03:16.989,Got enough trouble with guys like you.
00:03:16.989,00:03:19.908,"If you're gonna break my chops, you can take it on the arches."
00:03:19.908,00:03:23.954,"Sorry, sir, I didn't mean that."
00:03:23.954,00:03:25.664,Physical?

00:03:27.708,00:03:30.209,Twenty-six.

00:03:48.729,00:03:50.605,I was in the Marines too.
00:03:53.274,00:03:55.360,"So, what is it?"
00:03:55.360,00:03:58.405,You need an extra job?
00:03:58.405,00:04:00.908,Are you moonlighting?
00:04:00.908,00:04:04.327,"Well, I-- I just wanna work long hours."
00:04:04.327,00:04:05.913,What's moonlighting?
00:04:05.913,00:04:11.459,"Look, uh, just fill out these forms and check back tomorrow when the shift breaks."
00:04:11.459,00:04:13.336,"O'Brien, please step up."
00:04:13.336,00:04:16.131,"Take the car out through 58th Street, please."
00:04:16.131,00:04:18.133,'Cause it's crowded on 57th.
00:04:19.134,00:04:21.678,"MAN: Hey, Rodriguez!"
00:04:27.601,00:04:30.938,"All right, all right, I'm coming down there."
00:05:13.438,00:05:15.315,BICKLE: May 10th.
00:05:15.315,00:05:20.737,"Thank God for the rain, which has helped wash away the garbage and the trash off the sidewalks."
00:05:22.156,00:05:24.074,I'm working long hours now.
00:05:24.074,00:05:28.078,"Six in the afternoon to 6 in the morning, sometimes even 8 in the morning."
00:05:28.078,00:05:31.498,"Six days a week, sometimes seven days a week."
00:05:31.498,00:05:34.668,"It's a long hustle, but it keeps me real busy."
00:05:34.668,00:05:37.254,"I can take in 3, 350 a week."
00:05:37.254,00:05:39.881,Sometimes even more when I do it off the meter.
00:06:04.031,00:06:07.784,All the animals come out at night.
00:06:07.784,00:06:12.580,"Whores, skunk-pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies."

00:06:18.753,00:06:22.549,Someday a real rain'll come and wash all this scum off the streets.
00:06:30.473,00:06:31.933,I go all over.
00:06:31.933,00:06:34.061,"I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn."
00:06:34.061,00:06:36.771,I take them to Harlem.
00:06:36.771,00:06:38.397,Don't make no difference to me.
00:06:38.397,00:06:42.277,It does to some.
00:06:42.277,00:06:43.862,Don't make no difference to me.
00:06:43.862,00:06:45.906,"MAN: Driver, 48th and 6th, please."
00:06:45.906,00:06:49.492,"Man, you are gorgeous!"
00:06:52.746,00:06:54.873,I can't afford to get stopped anywhere.
00:06:54.873,00:06:57.209,"Oh, no. We wouldn't want that to happen."
00:06:57.209,00:07:01.296,"MAN: There'll be a big tip in it for you, you do the right things."
00:07:01.296,00:07:03.382,You got a way.
00:07:03.382,00:07:05.092,You got a way.
00:07:05.092,00:07:08.887,Yeah. Now you're talkin'!
00:07:08.887,00:07:10.764,"Oh, driver, hurry up, will you?"
00:07:12.182,00:07:13.433,Yeah.
00:07:48.927,00:07:53.681,BICKLE: Each night when I return the cab to the garage I have to clean the come off the back seat.
00:07:58.686,00:08:00.688,"Some nights, I clean off the blood."
00:08:34.555,00:08:36.350,Can I help you?
00:08:36.350,00:08:38.435,"Yeah, what's your name?"
00:08:38.435,00:08:40.145,My name is Travis.
00:08:40.145,00:08:42.397,That's nice.
00:08:44.358,00:08:46.276,I'd like to know what your name is. What's your name?
00:08:48.028,00:08:49.321,Give me a break.
00:08:49.321,00:08:50.864,"Look, you can tell me what your name is."
00:08:50.864,00:08:53.700,"I'm not gonna do anything, you know..."
00:08:53.700,00:08:55.160,Do you want me to call the manager?
00:08:55.160,00:08:57.371,"Oh, you don't have to call the manager."
00:08:57.371,00:09:01.124,Troy!
00:09:01.124,00:09:02.459,Okay.
00:09:02.459,00:09:04.711,Can I have a Chuckles there?
00:09:06.087,00:09:08.423,"And, uh, do you have any Jujubes?"
00:09:08.423,00:09:10.717,"Uh, they last longer."
00:09:10.717,00:09:12.552,What you see is what we got.
00:09:17.516,00:09:18.933,A Clark bar.
00:09:21.728,00:09:23.438,I'll take these.
00:09:26.024,00:09:27.692,Coca-Cola.
00:09:27.692,00:09:31.112,We don't have Coca-Cola.
00:09:32.822,00:09:34.449,A dollar eighty-five.
00:09:57.180,00:10:01.351,BICKLE: Twelve hours of work and I still can't sleep.
00:10:01.351,00:10:02.685,Damn.
00:10:02.685,00:10:05.730,Days go on and on.
00:10:05.730,00:10:06.856,And they don't end.
00:10:08.567,00:10:12.028,All my life needed was a sense of some place to go.
00:10:12.028,00:10:16.575,I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention.
00:10:16.575,00:10:20.036,I believe that someone should become a person like other people.
00:10:22.789,00:10:27.210,I first saw her at Palantine campaign headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.
00:10:27.210,00:10:31.214,She was wearing a white dress.
00:10:31.214,00:10:34.259,She appeared like an angel...
00:10:34.259,00:10:36.970,out of this filthy mass.
00:10:36.970,00:10:38.721,She is alone.
00:10:40.390,00:10:42.183,They...
00:10:42.183,00:10:44.144,cannot...
00:10:44.144,00:10:46.187,touch...
00:10:46.187,00:10:47.564,her.
00:10:58.866,00:11:02.287,"Yes. Well, you delivered two boxes."
00:11:02.287,00:11:05.206,I think it's a total of 5000 campaign buttons.
00:11:05.206,00:11:11.754,"Now, all the ones we had before and our slogan is: We are the people, and are is underlined."
00:11:11.754,00:11:14.382,These new buttons have we underlined.
00:11:14.382,00:11:17.177,"That reads, We are the people."
00:11:17.177,00:11:19.095,"Well, I think there's a difference."
00:11:19.095,00:11:23.600,We are the people is not the same as We are the people.
00:11:23.600,00:11:26.019,Let's not fight.
00:11:26.019,00:11:28.480,"Look, we'll make it real simple."
00:11:28.480,00:11:30.815,We don't pay for the buttons.
00:11:30.815,00:11:32.900,"We throw the buttons away, all right?"
00:11:32.900,00:11:35.111,"WOMAN: Tom, come here a minute."
00:11:36.571,00:11:37.905,What?
00:11:44.245,00:11:45.580,What is it?
00:11:45.580,00:11:51.044,"This canvass report is about ready to go, check it out with Andy and if he okays it, have a copy sent to headquarters in every county."
00:11:51.044,00:11:53.129,I gotta get that New York Times article xeroxed.
00:11:53.129,00:11:54.381,Don't forget the new photos.
00:11:54.381,00:11:55.923,I didn't forget it.
00:11:55.923,00:11:58.510,We have to emphasize the mandatory welfare program.
00:11:58.510,00:12:00.470,That's the issue that should be pushed.
00:12:00.470,00:12:02.180,"First push the man, then the issue."
00:12:02.180,00:12:04.599,Senator Palantine is a dynamic man.
00:12:04.599,00:12:07.726,"An intelligent, interesting, fresh, fascinating man."
00:12:07.726,00:12:09.145,You forgot sexy.
00:12:09.145,00:12:11.105,"Man, I did not forget sexy."
00:12:11.105,00:12:13.525,Listen to you. You sound like you're selling mouthwash.
00:12:13.525,00:12:14.942,We are selling mouthwash.
00:12:14.942,00:12:17.195,Are we authorized to do that?
00:12:17.195,00:12:20.407,You can get in trouble selling pharmaceuticals in a campaign office.
00:12:20.407,00:12:23.493,My uncle's in jail because of that.
00:12:23.493,00:12:25.161,"Well, it's not really jail."
00:12:25.161,00:12:27.539,"Of course, living with his wife, anything would be jail."
00:12:27.539,00:12:29.040,Look over there.
00:12:29.040,00:12:30.333,I love you.
00:12:30.333,00:12:31.834,Notice anything?
00:12:31.834,00:12:34.295,No.
00:12:34.295,00:12:37.048,"Okay, just a minute."
00:12:37.048,00:12:39.593,That taxi driver's been staring at us.
00:12:48.685,00:12:50.103,What taxi driver?
00:12:50.103,00:12:52.313,"That one, the one that's sitting there."
00:12:52.313,00:12:53.898,TOM: How long has he been there?
00:12:53.898,00:12:56.025,"I don't know, but it feels like a long time."
00:12:56.025,00:12:57.402,Does he bother you?
00:12:57.402,00:12:59.279,No.
00:12:59.279,00:13:01.364,"You really mean yes, and you're being sarcastic."
00:13:01.364,00:13:03.491,"Oh, you're quick."
00:13:03.491,00:13:05.493,"Well, I try to be real quick."
00:13:05.493,00:13:09.205,"Tell you what, I'll play the male in this relationship-- Good luck."
00:13:09.205,00:13:10.873,--and tell him to move.
00:13:10.873,00:13:12.875,And I don't need good luck.
00:13:12.875,00:13:15.670,"Oh, yes, you do."
00:13:23.052,00:13:24.845,"Say, you're blocking our doorway."
00:13:24.845,00:13:26.931,You think you might wanna move your cab?
00:15:07.782,00:15:12.912,"WIZARD: You know, eye shadow, mascara, lipstick, rouge."
00:15:12.912,00:15:16.708,MAN: Not rouge.
00:15:16.708,00:15:17.876,WIZARD: The kind with the brush.
00:15:17.876,00:15:20.127,"MAN: Yeah, it's Blush-on."
00:15:22.129,00:15:23.339,Travis.
00:15:23.339,00:15:24.591,"Hey, Wiz."
00:15:24.591,00:15:27.844,That's Blush-on.
00:15:27.844,00:15:29.637,Ask Travis.
00:15:29.637,00:15:32.265,"A cup of coffee, please."
00:15:32.265,00:15:35.309,"Anyway, whatever the fuck it is, she uses a lot of it, you know?"
00:15:35.309,00:15:37.562,And then perfume.
00:15:37.562,00:15:38.772,And then get this.
00:15:38.772,00:15:43.943,In the middle of the Triborough Bridge-- And this woman is beautiful.
00:15:43.943,00:15:45.528,No.
00:15:45.528,00:15:46.821,But what'd you do?
00:15:46.821,00:15:51.242,"I throw the meter, you know, and I jump in the back seat and I whip it out."
00:15:51.242,00:15:53.787,"I said, You know what this is?"
00:15:53.787,00:15:56.414,"She says, It's love."
00:15:56.414,00:16:01.168,"She goes wild, you know, and she said: That's the greatest single experience of my life."
00:16:01.168,00:16:04.964,Then she gave me a $200 tip and her phone number in Acapulco.
00:16:06.215,00:16:08.468,"Travis, you know Doughboy, Charlie T.?"
00:16:09.761,00:16:11.053,"DOUGHBOY: Hey, Travis."
00:16:11.053,00:16:13.097,Got change for a nickel?
00:16:13.097,00:16:15.475,We call him Doughboy 'cause he'll do anything for a buck.
00:16:15.475,00:16:17.685,"So, uh..."
00:16:17.685,00:16:19.019,So how's it hanging?
00:16:23.775,00:16:25.192,What's that?
00:16:27.737,00:16:29.906,"Well, I turn on the radio."
00:16:29.906,00:16:32.199,Some fleet driver from Bell just got all cut up.
00:16:32.199,00:16:33.534,Stickup?
00:16:33.534,00:16:36.287,"No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker."
00:16:36.287,00:16:38.456,Cut half his ear off.
00:16:38.456,00:16:40.500,It was at 122nd Street.
00:16:42.376,00:16:43.878,Fucking Mau Mau land.
00:16:46.881,00:16:49.759,"DOUGHBOY: You run all over town, don't you, Travis?"
00:16:51.302,00:16:52.762,Travis?
00:16:57.183,00:16:58.476,Travis.
00:16:59.811,00:17:01.228,"You run all over town, don't you?"
00:17:01.228,00:17:02.730,Yeah.
00:17:02.730,00:17:05.274,"I mean, you handle some pretty rough customers, huh?"
00:17:05.274,00:17:07.318,"Yeah, I have."
00:17:07.318,00:17:08.569,You carry a piece?
00:17:08.569,00:17:10.363,No.
00:17:10.363,00:17:12.365,You need one?
00:17:12.365,00:17:16.076,"DOUGHBOY: If you ever need one, I know a fella who can get you a real nice deal."
00:17:16.076,00:17:18.287,There's lots of shit around.
00:17:18.287,00:17:20.790,WIZARD: I never use mine.
00:17:22.249,00:17:24.544,But it's a good thing to have just as a threat.
00:17:34.220,00:17:37.390,"DOUGHBOY: Well, I'm gonna go dig my dirt."
00:17:38.766,00:17:40.059,Travis.
00:17:42.186,00:17:44.647,Look.
00:17:44.647,00:17:47.608,Piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.
00:17:47.608,00:17:49.402,Dig the symbols.
00:17:49.402,00:17:52.989,F-4-0-5-4-3-4.
00:17:54.365,00:17:56.409,And the watermark.
00:17:56.409,00:18:01.915,"There's one person, there's two persons, and there's three persons."
00:18:01.915,00:18:04.208,"I got this at his estate, The Pines."
00:18:04.208,00:18:08.504,"Look, why don't you take it, and if you can sell it you give me half of what you got."
00:18:08.504,00:18:10.590,I don't want to.
00:18:10.590,00:18:13.051,"Well. Hey, I'm gonna get in my cab and boogie."
00:18:27.314,00:18:29.692,"Oh, I'm so terribly sorry."
00:18:29.692,00:18:30.985,Well...
00:18:30.985,00:18:32.779,Nothing.
00:18:32.779,00:18:34.948,That's very cute.
00:18:34.948,00:18:36.490,"Hey, you wanna see something?"
00:18:38.076,00:18:41.412,"Wait, I just typed, You wanna see something?"
00:18:41.412,00:18:42.705,What?
00:18:42.705,00:18:49.879,If you had these three fingers missing on this hand and that hand missing on that hand-- Yeah?
00:18:49.879,00:18:51.464,--how would you light the match?
00:18:51.464,00:18:52.590,I wouldn't light a match.
00:18:52.590,00:18:54.717,Go ahead.
00:18:57.053,00:18:59.055,"Well, I don't think I could do it."
00:18:59.055,00:19:00.681,No?
00:19:00.681,00:19:02.391,It's gonna be difficult.
00:19:02.391,00:19:03.977,I'll give it a try.
00:19:10.357,00:19:12.234,Oh.
00:19:12.234,00:19:14.779,I got the-- My thumb back for a second. Thank God.
00:19:16.447,00:19:17.865,Just a minute.
00:19:25.581,00:19:26.958,I can't do it.
00:19:26.958,00:19:29.627,"Well, the guy at the newsstand can do it."
00:19:29.627,00:19:30.962,"Well, I don't work at a newsstand."
00:19:33.047,00:19:35.049,"Anyway, he's probably Italian."
00:19:35.049,00:19:36.634,You're sure he's not?
00:19:36.634,00:19:39.095,"If he had been Italian, he might've been a thief."
00:19:39.095,00:19:40.888,"I mean, they do that."
00:19:40.888,00:19:44.934,"If-- If a thief screws up on the job, you know, they'll blow his fingers off."
00:19:42.890,00:19:47.227,"I'll tell you something else, this sounds like a joke, but it's true."
00:19:47.227,00:19:50.272,"If they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body."
00:19:50.272,00:19:51.565,Apparently it's symbolic.
00:19:51.565,00:19:53.609,Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?
00:19:53.609,00:19:56.570,I don't know why not a pigeon.
00:19:56.570,00:19:58.197,You gotta catch a pigeon.
00:19:58.197,00:20:01.993,"A canary, you can walk right into a pet store, pay for it, boom, kill it right there."
00:20:01.993,00:20:03.661,Put it on anyone you want.
00:20:30.229,00:20:32.481,Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
00:20:32.481,00:20:34.274,Great. I'll take you right over here.
00:20:34.274,00:20:36.027,"I'd rather volunteer to her, if you don't mind."
00:20:40.531,00:20:42.909,Why do you feel that you have to volunteer to me?
00:20:42.909,00:20:46.746,Because I think that you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
00:20:49.582,00:20:51.042,Thanks.
00:20:51.042,00:20:52.960,But what do you think of Palantine?
00:20:56.797,00:20:58.132,"Well, I..."
00:20:58.132,00:21:02.220,"Charles Palantine, the man you're volunteering to help elect president."
00:21:03.846,00:21:05.681,"Well, I'm sure he'll make a good president."
00:21:05.681,00:21:08.851,"I don't know what his policies are, but I'm sure he'll make a good one."
00:21:10.603,00:21:13.189,You wanna canvass?
00:21:13.189,00:21:16.067,How do you feel about the senator's stand on welfare?
00:21:16.067,00:21:20.738,"I don't really know the senator's stand on welfare, but I'm sure it's a good stand."
00:21:20.738,00:21:22.240,You're sure of that?
00:21:22.240,00:21:23.574,Yeah.
00:21:26.410,00:21:32.041,"Well, we all work together here, full-time, day and night, so I'm sure the gentlemen will sign you up over there."
00:21:32.041,00:21:36.796,"The thing is, I drive a taxi at night, so it's kind of hard for me to, um..."
00:21:36.796,00:21:38.047,To work in the day.
00:21:38.047,00:21:40.507,"So, uh..."
00:21:40.507,00:21:42.301,Then what exactly do you want?
00:21:42.301,00:21:45.221,Would you like to come have some coffee and pie with me?
00:21:45.221,00:21:47.431,Why?
00:21:47.431,00:21:49.183,Yeah.
00:21:50.768,00:21:52.436,I think you're a lonely person.
00:21:52.436,00:21:55.273,"I drive by this place a lot, and I see you here."
00:21:55.273,00:22:02.655,"I see a lot of people around you, and I see all these phones and all this stuff on your desk that means nothing."
00:22:02.655,00:22:10.746,"And when I came inside and I met you, I saw in your eyes and I saw the way you carried yourself that you're not a happy person."
00:22:10.746,00:22:12.581,And I think you need something.
00:22:12.581,00:22:15.417,"And if you wanna call it a friend, you can call it a friend."
00:22:15.417,00:22:17.795,You're gonna be my friend?
00:22:17.795,00:22:19.130,Yeah.
00:22:27.554,00:22:29.015,What do you say?
00:22:33.351,00:22:36.147,"It's a little hard standing here and asking you, so..."
00:22:41.319,00:22:43.237,"Five minutes, that's all."
00:22:43.237,00:22:45.072,Right around here.
00:22:45.072,00:22:47.491,I'm there to protect you.
00:22:52.913,00:22:54.874,Come on. Just take a little break.
00:22:57.918,00:23:00.796,I have a break at 4:00.
00:22:57.918,00:23:02.715,And if you're here-- 4 o' clock today?
00:23:02.715,00:23:06.302,I'll be here.
00:23:06.302,00:23:09.055,"All right, 4 p.m."
00:23:09.055,00:23:11.265,Outside in the front?
00:23:11.265,00:23:12.850,Okay.
00:23:12.850,00:23:15.144,"Oh, my name is Travis. Betsy?"
00:23:15.144,00:23:18.022,Travis.
00:23:18.022,00:23:20.066,"I appreciate this, Betsy."
00:23:35.248,00:23:37.875,"BICKLE: May 26th, 4:00 p.m."
00:23:37.875,00:23:41.212,I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee Shop on Columbus Circle.
00:23:42.671,00:23:47.467,I had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted yellow cheese.
00:23:47.467,00:23:50.054,I think that was a good selection.
00:23:50.054,00:23:52.430,Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish.
00:23:52.430,00:23:54.558,She could've had anything she wanted.
00:23:54.558,00:23:57.395,Fifteen thousand volunteers in New York alone's not bad.
00:23:57.395,00:23:59.521,"But, Christ, the organizational problems."
00:23:59.521,00:24:01.439,Mm.
00:24:01.439,00:24:04.610,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
00:24:04.610,00:24:06.112,I gotta get organized.
00:24:06.112,00:24:10.532,"You know, little things, like my apartment, my possessions."
00:24:10.532,00:24:14.494,"I should get one of those signs says: One of these days, I'm gonna get organiz-ized."
00:24:14.494,00:24:16.330,You mean organized?
00:24:16.330,00:24:18.707,Organiz-ized.
00:24:18.707,00:24:21.835,Organiz-ized.
00:24:21.835,00:24:24.588,O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.
00:24:24.588,00:24:26.715,"Oh, you mean organiz-ize."
00:24:26.715,00:24:29.218,"Like those little signs in offices that say, Thimk."
00:24:35.057,00:24:36.683,Do you like the place you're working?
00:24:38.102,00:24:40.062,We've got some good people working for us.
00:24:40.062,00:24:42.148,And I think Palantine's got a good chance.
00:24:45.985,00:24:47.820,You know you have beautiful eyes?
00:24:54.785,00:24:56.787,Do you like the guy you work with?
00:24:56.787,00:24:58.122,He's okay.
00:25:00.040,00:25:02.168,"Yeah, I know."
00:25:02.168,00:25:05.379,"Well, he's funny, and he's very good at his job. He's okay."
00:25:05.379,00:25:07.047,Though he does have a few problems.
00:25:07.047,00:25:09.467,I would say he has quite a few problems.
00:25:11.177,00:25:14.638,His energy seems to go in the wrong places.
00:25:14.638,00:25:22.313,"When I walked in and I saw you two sitting there, I could just tell by the way you were relating that there was no connection whatsoever."
00:25:22.313,00:25:25.858,"And I felt when I walked in, that there was something between us."
00:25:25.858,00:25:28.735,There was an impulse that we were both following.
00:25:28.735,00:25:31.322,So that gave me the right to come in and talk to you.
00:25:31.322,00:25:35.617,"Otherwise, I never would've felt that I had the right to talk to you or say anything to you."
00:25:35.617,00:25:39.455,I never would've had the courage to talk to you.
00:25:39.455,00:25:41.957,"And with him, I felt there was nothing."
00:25:41.957,00:25:44.084,"When I walked in, I knew I was right."
00:25:44.084,00:25:45.503,Did you feel that way?
00:25:48.797,00:25:51.384,I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
00:25:53.386,00:25:54.928,Where are you from?
00:25:54.928,00:25:56.680,Upstate.
00:26:00.393,00:26:02.353,"That fellow you work with, I don't like him."
00:26:02.353,00:26:05.605,"Not that I don't like him, I just think he's silly."
00:26:07.274,00:26:09.276,I don't think he respects you.
00:26:11.320,00:26:14.572,I don't believe I've ever met anyone quite like you.
00:26:25.543,00:26:27.211,"You wanna go to, um-- Um..."
00:26:28.586,00:26:30.714,a movie with me?
00:26:30.714,00:26:32.258,I have to go back to work now.
00:26:32.258,00:26:34.051,I don't mean now.
00:26:41.183,00:26:43.143,Sure. You know what you remind me of?
00:26:44.602,00:26:45.938,What?
00:26:45.938,00:26:47.440,That song...
00:26:48.482,00:26:51.693,by Kris Kristofferson.
00:26:53.695,00:26:55.030,Who's that?
00:26:55.030,00:26:57.199,The songwriter.
00:26:57.199,00:26:58.825,He's a prophet...
00:26:58.825,00:27:05.249,"He's a prophet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction."
00:27:06.584,00:27:07.834,You saying that about me?
00:27:07.834,00:27:10.212,Who else would I be talking about?
00:27:10.212,00:27:12.506,I'm no pusher.
00:27:13.924,00:27:16.385,"No, no, just the part about the contradictions."
00:27:16.385,00:27:18.720,You are that.
00:27:48.959,00:27:54.756,"BICKLE: I called Betsy again at her office, and she said maybe we'd go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow."
00:27:54.756,00:27:57.343,That's my day off.
00:27:54.756,00:28:00.429,"At first she hesitated, but I called her again and then she agreed."
00:28:01.721,00:28:03.681,"Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no."
00:28:03.681,00:28:06.310,Betsy what? I forgot to ask her last name again.
00:28:06.310,00:28:09.104,Damn! I gotta remember stuff like that.
00:28:20.866,00:28:26.704,MAN: Don't worry about anybody here committing themselves until things start coming in from California.
00:28:26.704,00:28:29.833,"Listen, I think we should've waited for the limo."
00:28:29.833,00:28:34.087,"MAN 2: I don't mind taking a cab, but I mind going out to California without the right preparation."
00:28:34.087,00:28:35.713,That's gonna get us in trouble.
00:28:35.713,00:28:38.133,"Are you Charles Palantine, the candidate?"
00:28:39.426,00:28:40.719,"Yes, I am."
00:28:42.555,00:28:44.097,I'm one of your biggest supporters.
00:28:44.097,00:28:48.018,I tell everybody that comes in this taxi that they have to vote for you.
00:28:48.018,00:28:49.853,"Why, thank you..."
00:28:51.564,00:28:53.940,Travis.
00:28:53.940,00:28:56.443,Everybody I know's gonna vote for you.
00:28:56.443,00:29:01.532,"You know, I was gonna put one of your stickers in my taxi, but the company said it was against their policy."
00:29:01.532,00:29:03.617,But they don't know anything.
00:29:03.617,00:29:10.165,"PALANTINE: Let me tell you, I have learned more about America from riding in taxicabs than in all the limos in the country."
00:29:11.958,00:29:13.252,"Oh, yeah?"
00:29:13.252,00:29:15.170,That's true.
00:29:15.170,00:29:16.505,"Can I ask you something, Travis?"
00:29:16.505,00:29:17.881,Sure.
00:29:17.881,00:29:21.301,What is the one thing about this country that bugs you the most?
00:29:22.595,00:29:24.096,"Well, I don't know."
00:29:24.096,00:29:26.056,"I don't follow political issues that closely, sir."
00:29:26.056,00:29:28.350,I don't know.
00:29:28.350,00:29:30.686,"PALANTINE: Oh, well, there must be something."
00:29:30.686,00:29:37.817,"Well, whatever it is, he should clean up this city here because this city here's like an open sewer."
00:29:37.817,00:29:39.486,"You know, it's full of filth and scum."
00:29:39.486,00:29:41.821,And sometimes I can hardly take it.
00:29:41.821,00:29:48.036,Whatever ever becomes the president should just-- --really clean it up.
00:29:48.036,00:29:49.913,Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
00:29:49.913,00:29:51.790,"I get headaches, it's so bad, you know."
00:29:51.790,00:29:55.419,"And they just like-- They just never go away, you know?"
00:29:55.419,00:29:59.506,It's like-- I think that the president should just clean up this whole mess here.
00:29:59.506,00:30:02.509,He should flush it right down the fucking toilet.
00:30:08.223,00:30:10.350,"Well, uh..."
00:30:10.350,00:30:13.771,"I think I know what you mean, Travis."
00:30:13.771,00:30:15.439,But it's not gonna be easy.
00:30:15.439,00:30:17.650,We'll have to make some radical changes.
00:30:17.650,00:30:19.192,Damn straight.
00:30:20.736,00:30:22.613,"MAN: Here you go, Travis."
00:30:22.613,00:30:24.072,Thank you.
00:30:27.534,00:30:28.868,"Nice talking to you, Travis."
00:30:28.868,00:30:30.329,"Nice talking to you, sir."
00:30:30.329,00:30:32.623,You're a good man.
00:30:32.623,00:30:34.458,Thank you. Drive safe.
00:30:57.105,00:30:59.566,"Come on, man."
00:31:02.611,00:31:04.237,Come on!
00:31:05.614,00:31:07.574,"MAN: Come on, baby."
00:31:07.574,00:31:10.118,"Now, come on!"
00:31:11.620,00:31:13.205,You wanna get busted?
00:31:13.205,00:31:14.707,"Now, bitch, be cool!"
00:31:23.507,00:31:25.050,Don't start no trouble.
00:31:26.844,00:31:28.846,"Cabbie, just forget about this."
00:31:28.846,00:31:30.138,"Be cool, bitch!"
00:31:38.938,00:31:40.273,MAN 1: Stop!
00:31:40.273,00:31:41.817,MAN 2: Wanna hear something?
00:31:47.906,00:31:49.491,"What's the matter, baby?"
00:32:24.401,00:32:26.486,Get your ass out of here!
00:33:35.221,00:33:37.015,"Hi, there."
00:33:38.433,00:33:39.768,Have a nice day today?
00:33:39.768,00:33:41.436,Not particularly.
00:33:41.436,00:33:42.896,I got a present for you.
00:33:47.317,00:33:50.737,Now back to Gene Krupa's syncopated style shortly.
00:33:59.204,00:34:00.747,Why'd you do that?
00:34:00.747,00:34:04.083,I don't know. What else am I gonna do with my money?
00:34:04.083,00:34:06.670,I wish you'd have listened to this.
00:34:06.670,00:34:09.798,"Well, I woulda, except my record player doesn't work now."
00:34:09.798,00:34:11.466,Your stereo's broken?
00:34:11.466,00:34:14.260,How can you stand it?
00:34:14.260,00:34:16.513,"I don't follow music too much, but I would really like to."
00:34:16.513,00:34:18.056,I really would.
00:34:18.056,00:34:19.933,Then you haven't played this record yet?
00:34:19.933,00:34:22.268,No.
00:34:22.268,00:34:27.106,"But I-I was thinking maybe, you know, we could listen to it on your record player."
00:34:27.106,00:34:30.819,"Now, going back to 40 years of Chick Webb."
00:34:46.501,00:34:48.503,You gotta be kidding.
00:34:48.503,00:34:49.922,What?
00:34:49.922,00:34:52.549,This is a dirty movie.
00:34:52.549,00:34:56.678,"No, no. This-- This is a-- This is a movie that a lot of couples come to."
00:34:56.678,00:34:58.722,All kinds of couples go here.
00:34:58.722,00:35:01.433,You sure about that?
00:35:01.433,00:35:03.226,"Yeah, I see 'em all the time."
00:35:06.730,00:35:08.065,Come on.
00:35:46.603,00:35:48.271,Excuse me.
00:35:48.271,00:35:50.315,CROWD: Shh!
00:35:50.315,00:35:52.525,BICKLE: Where are you going?
00:35:52.525,00:35:54.111,BICKLE: Why?
00:35:54.111,00:35:55.570,BETSY: I don't know why I came in here.
00:35:55.570,00:35:56.989,I don't like these movies.
00:35:56.989,00:36:00.784,"Well, I mean, I-- You know, I didn't know that you would-- You'd feel that way about this movie."
00:36:00.784,00:36:04.621,"I don't know much about movies, but if I had known-- These the only movies you go to?"
00:36:04.621,00:36:10.460,"Yeah, I mean, I come and-- This is not so bad-- Taking me to a place like this is about as exciting to me as saying, Let's fuck."
00:36:14.213,00:36:17.050,"Um, there are other places I can take you."
00:36:17.050,00:36:19.052,Plenty of other movies I can take you to.
00:36:19.052,00:36:21.680,"I don't know much about them, but I can take you other places."
00:36:21.680,00:36:22.973,We're just different.
00:36:22.973,00:36:25.224,Hey-- Hey. Wait a second.
00:36:25.224,00:36:26.476,I have to go.
00:36:26.476,00:36:27.894,I've gotta go now.
00:36:27.894,00:36:29.646,"Wait a second, I wanna talk to you."
00:36:29.646,00:36:31.731,Don't just walk-- Wait a second.
00:36:31.731,00:36:33.316,Taxi!
00:36:33.316,00:36:34.776,Can I talk to you at least?
00:36:34.776,00:36:36.111,"I mean, won't you at least talk to me?"
00:36:36.111,00:36:39.364,"I-- I didn't know you'd-- Look, won't you take the record?"
00:36:39.364,00:36:41.908,I've already got it.
00:36:41.908,00:36:43.409,"Please, I bought it for you, Betsy."
00:36:43.409,00:36:45.954,"Okay, thanks."
00:36:45.954,00:36:47.246,Can I call you?
00:36:49.082,00:36:51.417,"Jesus Christ, I got a taxi."
00:36:56.464,00:36:58.800,"Hello, Betsy."
00:36:58.800,00:37:00.468,"Hi, it's Travis."
00:37:02.721,00:37:04.222,How you doing--?
00:37:02.721,00:37:06.141,"Listen, uh, I'm-- I'm sorry about the-- The other night."
00:37:06.141,00:37:08.351,I didn't know that was the way you felt about it.
00:37:10.562,00:37:12.814,"Well, I-- I-- I didn't know that was the way you felt."
00:37:12.814,00:37:15.025,If I-- I would have taken you somewhere else.
00:37:16.068,00:37:18.737,"Uh, are you feeling better or...?"
00:37:20.072,00:37:21.656,"Oh, maybe you had a-- A virus or something."
00:37:21.656,00:37:23.950,"A 24-hour virus, you know."
00:37:23.950,00:37:25.911,It can happen. Yeah.
00:37:25.911,00:37:27.787,Um...
00:37:27.787,00:37:29.122,"You, uh..."
00:37:30.957,00:37:32.792,"You been-- You've been working hard, huh?"
00:37:32.792,00:37:34.544,"Well, that's-- Yeah."
00:37:34.544,00:37:37.296,Okay-- Uh...
00:37:37.296,00:37:42.928,"Would you like to have, uh, some dinner, uh, with me, um, in the next, you know, few days or something?"
00:37:46.806,00:37:48.516,"Well, how 'bout just a cup of coffee?"
00:37:48.516,00:37:52.145,"I could come by the, uh-- The headquarters or something, and we could, uh..."
00:37:53.646,00:37:56.149,"Oh, ok-- Okay, okay."
00:37:56.149,00:37:57.901,Uh...
00:37:57.901,00:38:00.528,Did you get my flowers in the...?
00:38:02.655,00:38:06.659,You didn't get them?
00:38:10.789,00:38:13.166,Yeah. Well...
00:38:13.166,00:38:14.459,Can--?
00:38:14.459,00:38:17.796,"Uh-- Uh, tomorrow or the next day?"
00:38:17.796,00:38:21.549,"Okay. All right-- No, I'm gonna-- Okay, yeah, sure."
00:38:21.549,00:38:22.842,So long.
00:38:25.303,00:38:31.392,"BICKLE: I tried several times to call her, but after the first call, she wouldn't come to the phone any longer."
00:38:31.392,00:38:34.146,"I also sent flowers, but with no luck."
00:38:34.146,00:38:37.356,The smell of the flowers only made me sicker.
00:38:37.356,00:38:40.735,The headaches got worse.
00:38:42.361,00:38:44.864,"I shouldn't complain, though."
00:38:44.864,00:38:47.659,You're only as healthy...
00:38:47.659,00:38:51.454,You're only as healthy as you feel.
00:38:51.454,00:38:52.998,You're only...
00:38:52.998,00:38:55.125,as healthy...
00:38:55.125,00:38:56.668,as...
00:38:56.668,00:38:58.253,you...
00:38:58.253,00:39:00.088,feel.
00:39:10.140,00:39:11.808,"Let's not have any trouble, okay?"
00:39:11.808,00:39:13.977,What are you talking about?
00:39:13.977,00:39:15.937,Why don't you answer my calls when I call you?
00:39:15.937,00:39:19.024,You think I don't know you're here? You think I don't know?
00:39:19.024,00:39:20.608,Would you please leave?
00:39:20.608,00:39:23.444,"Okay, then leave, okay?"
00:39:20.608,00:39:25.738,"I just want you to know-- Please, just leave."
00:39:25.738,00:39:27.199,Take your hands off me.
00:39:27.199,00:39:29.075,Take your hands off!
00:39:29.075,00:39:31.452,Take 'em off!
00:39:31.452,00:39:33.538,"I'm gonna tell you, you're in a hell!"
00:39:33.538,00:39:35.290,And you're gonna die in hell like the rest.
00:39:35.290,00:39:37.334,"Come on, now. There's a cop across the street."
00:39:37.334,00:39:39.169,You're like the rest of them.
00:39:39.169,00:39:40.753,TOM: Officer!
00:39:43.422,00:39:44.841,Officer!
00:39:46.384,00:39:49.346,"TOM: Look, don't come around here, because I'll call the police!"
00:39:51.139,00:39:56.228,"BICKLE: I realize now how much she's just like the others, cold and distant."
00:39:56.228,00:39:57.979,And many people are like that.
00:39:57.979,00:40:01.566,Women for sure.
00:40:01.566,00:40:04.110,"Yo, cab!"
00:40:11.701,00:40:13.995,"MAN: Yeah, okay, pull over to the curb over there."
00:40:13.995,00:40:15.830,Right over to the curb.
00:40:17.165,00:40:21.753,"No, no, don't-- Don't-- Don't-- Oh. Oh! The fucking meter."
00:40:22.921,00:40:24.923,What are you doing with the meter?
00:40:24.923,00:40:26.174,Did I tell you to put--?
00:40:26.174,00:40:28.134,Did I tell you to do that with the meter?
00:40:28.134,00:40:30.595,Put the meter back.
00:40:30.595,00:40:32.097,I don't care what I have to pay.
00:40:32.097,00:40:33.598,We're-- I didn't-- I'm not getting out.
00:40:33.598,00:40:36.226,Put the meter back on.
00:40:36.226,00:40:38.519,Put it down.
00:40:38.519,00:40:39.771,Put it-- That's right.
00:40:39.771,00:40:41.147,Put it-- Put it down!
00:40:43.066,00:40:44.442,That's right.
00:40:45.610,00:40:47.112,Why are you writing?
00:40:47.112,00:40:48.238,Don't write!
00:40:48.238,00:40:50.073,Put the thing down.
00:40:53.243,00:40:54.994,I didn't tell you to write.
00:40:54.994,00:40:56.537,"I just said, Pull over to the curb."
00:40:56.537,00:40:59.165,We pulled over to the curb.
00:41:00.959,00:41:02.794,"Now, we're gonna sit."
00:41:21.146,00:41:25.066,"Cabbie, you see that light up there? The window?"
00:41:27.026,00:41:29.487,The light? The window up there in the second floor.
00:41:32.365,00:41:35.452,The one that's closest to the edge of the building.
00:41:37.036,00:41:40.206,The light up in the window.
00:41:42.000,00:41:43.918,"What are you, blind?"
00:41:43.918,00:41:45.962,Do--? Do you see the light?
00:41:45.962,00:41:47.380,BICKLE: Yeah.
00:41:47.380,00:41:49.215,"Yeah, you see it. Good."
00:41:51.592,00:41:52.927,You see the woman in the window?
00:41:55.388,00:41:58.266,Do you--? Do you see the woman in the window?
00:41:59.767,00:42:01.144,Yeah.
00:42:01.144,00:42:03.604,You see the woman. Good.
00:42:03.604,00:42:06.732,Because I want you to see that woman because that's my wife.
00:42:08.860,00:42:11.404,But that's not my apartment.
00:42:13.656,00:42:17.285,It's not my apartment.
00:42:17.285,00:42:19.162,"No, I mean, you wouldn't know who lives there."
00:42:19.162,00:42:22.290,But you know who lives there? Huh?
00:42:22.290,00:42:24.042,A nigger lives there.
00:42:24.042,00:42:25.918,How do you like that?
00:42:33.218,00:42:34.677,And I'm g-- I'm gonna kill her.
00:42:37.638,00:42:40.599,There's nothing else. I just-- I'm gonna kill her.
00:42:40.599,00:42:42.435,"Well, what do you think of that?"
00:42:42.435,00:42:43.644,Hm?
00:42:43.644,00:42:45.730,"I said, what do you think of that?"
00:42:46.939,00:42:48.441,Don't answer.
00:42:48.441,00:42:50.902,You don't have to answer everything.
00:42:55.198,00:42:57.867,I'm gonna kill her with a .44 Magnum pistol.
00:42:57.867,00:43:02.621,"I have a .44 Magnum pistol, and I'm gonna kill her with that gun."
00:43:02.621,00:43:04.249,"Now, did you ever see--?"
00:43:04.249,00:43:07.126,Did you ever see what a .44 Magnum pistol can do to a woman's face?
00:43:07.126,00:43:08.753,"I mean, it'd fucking destroy it."
00:43:08.753,00:43:11.172,Just blow it right apart.
00:43:11.172,00:43:13.425,That's what it can do to her face.
00:43:13.425,00:43:15.218,"Now, did you ever see what it can do to a woman's pussy?"
00:43:15.218,00:43:16.719,"Now, that you should see."
00:43:16.719,00:43:21.099,That-- You should see what a .44 Magnum's gonna do to a woman's pussy.
00:43:28.440,00:43:30.149,What's that?
00:43:30.149,00:43:33.236,"Now, I know-- I know you must think that I'm, you know..."
00:43:33.236,00:43:35.113,You must think I'm pretty sick or something.
00:43:35.113,00:43:38.074,"You know, I'm-- You must think I'm pretty sick."
00:43:38.074,00:43:39.951,Right? You must think I'm pretty sick?
00:43:39.951,00:43:41.244,Huh?
00:43:44.789,00:43:47.708,"Right? I bet-- I bet you really think I'm sick, right?"
00:43:47.708,00:43:49.252,You think I'm sick?
00:43:54.340,00:43:55.674,You think I'm sick?
00:43:59.929,00:44:01.514,You don't have to answer.
00:44:01.514,00:44:03.516,"I'm paying for the ride, you don't have to answer."
00:44:04.976,00:44:12.733,"WIZARD: I picked up this midget, you know, and he's very, very well-dressed, Italian suit, good-looking, with a beautiful tall blond."
00:44:12.733,00:44:14.277,Was it a--?
00:44:14.277,00:44:16.237,"No, the guy was a midget."
00:44:16.237,00:44:17.572,"Oh, right, I got you."
00:44:17.572,00:44:19.240,"I mean, the lady-- Those midgets are funny."
00:44:21.367,00:44:23.202,Sometimes I like to hold a midget.
00:44:23.202,00:44:25.079,Yeah?
00:44:25.079,00:44:26.705,They always wanna sit in the front seat.
00:44:28.249,00:44:30.209,"WIZARD: Then I pick up these two fags, you know?"
00:44:30.209,00:44:32.253,They're going-- They're going downtown.
00:44:34.088,00:44:36.299,They're wearing these rhinestone T-shirts.
00:44:36.299,00:44:38.510,"They start arguing, they start yelling."
00:44:38.510,00:44:41.720,"The other one says, You bitch, and starts beating him on the head."
00:44:41.720,00:44:46.684,"I say, Look, I don't care what you do in the privacy of your own home, behind closed doors."
00:44:46.684,00:44:49.020,This is an American free country.
00:44:49.020,00:44:50.480,We got a pursuit of happiness thing.
00:44:50.480,00:44:52.815,"You're consenting, you're adult."
00:44:52.815,00:44:58.779,"But, you know, uh, you know, in my fucking cab, don't go busting heads, you know what I mean?"
00:44:58.779,00:45:00.365,"God love you, do what you want."
00:45:00.365,00:45:02.033,Tell 'em to go to California.
00:45:02.033,00:45:07.497,"'Cause out in California, when two fags split up, one's gotta pay the other one alimony."
00:45:07.497,00:45:09.332,Not bad.
00:45:09.332,00:45:11.501,"Oh, they're way ahead out there, you know what I mean?"
00:45:11.501,00:45:13.419,California.
00:45:13.419,00:45:14.920,So I-- I tell them to get out of the fucking cab.
00:45:14.920,00:45:19.551,"MAN: You know, one time, I saw a cop chase this guy with one leg."
00:45:19.551,00:45:21.386,WIZARD: The-- The cop?
00:45:21.386,00:45:23.388,"No, no, no, the dude that he was chasing."
00:45:23.388,00:45:25.848,Fucking cops chase anything.
00:45:25.848,00:45:27.392,"Hey, you got that 5 you owe me?"
00:45:30.186,00:45:34.857,My man is loaded.
00:45:34.857,00:45:38.861,I'd be broke tonight if I hadn't caught me some people from Ohio out at Kennedy.
00:45:38.861,00:45:43.199,"I took 'em into Manhattan by way of Long Beach, tipped me $5."
00:45:43.199,00:45:45.451,WIZARD: What's the action around?
00:45:45.451,00:45:47.286,It's pretty slow.
00:45:48.246,00:45:49.830,I'm shoving on.
00:45:49.830,00:45:52.291,"Hey, Wiz, wait."
00:45:52.291,00:45:55.044,Can I talk to you for a second?
00:45:55.044,00:45:56.629,"CHARLIE T.: Bye, Killer."
00:45:58.839,00:46:01.050,MAN: Thank you. Night.
00:46:15.356,00:46:17.692,You put it down.
00:46:17.692,00:46:19.360,You can have them all you want!
00:46:19.360,00:46:20.695,"Hey, don't be hitting my man!"
00:46:20.695,00:46:24.741,"Don't be hit-- You-- You better take your ass out, boy!"
00:46:31.038,00:46:32.707,Yeah?
00:46:31.038,00:46:34.875,"Now, I know you and I ain't talked too much, you know."
00:46:34.875,00:46:37.378,"But I figure you've been around a lot, so you could..."
00:46:37.378,00:46:39.338,"Oh, shoot, that's why they call me the Wizard."
00:46:40.506,00:46:42.550,I got...
00:46:42.550,00:46:44.843,It's just that I got a...
00:46:44.843,00:46:46.803,I got a...
00:46:46.803,00:46:48.055,Things get-- Things got you down?
00:46:48.055,00:46:49.848,Yeah.
00:46:49.848,00:46:51.350,Happens to the best of them.
00:46:52.477,00:46:55.271,"Yeah, they got me real down."
00:47:00.568,00:47:06.073,"I just wanna go out and-- And, you know, like, really-- Really-- Really do something."
00:47:07.742,00:47:10.411,"Taxi life, you mean?"
00:47:11.579,00:47:14.457,"Yeah, well..."
00:47:14.457,00:47:17.502,"No, it's..."
00:47:17.502,00:47:18.961,I don't know.
00:47:21.005,00:47:22.423,I just wanna go out...
00:47:23.549,00:47:25.468,I really...
00:47:26.803,00:47:28.554,"You know, I really wanna..."
00:47:28.554,00:47:31.307,I got some bad ideas in my head.
00:47:28.554,00:47:36.270,"I just-- Oh, look. Look at it this way."
00:47:36.270,00:47:40.024,A man...
00:47:41.400,00:47:44.945,"And that job, you know, I mean, like, that..."
00:47:44.945,00:47:47.699,"You know, that becomes what he is."
00:47:47.699,00:47:49.575,"You know, like, uh..."
00:47:51.285,00:47:53.245,"You know, you do a thing, and that's what you are."
00:47:53.245,00:47:57.375,"I mean, like, I've been a-- I've been a cabbie for 17 years, you know?"
00:47:57.375,00:47:59.168,Ten years at night.
00:47:59.168,00:48:02.755,"And I still don't own my own cab, you know. Why?"
00:48:02.755,00:48:04.048,Because I don't want to.
00:48:04.048,00:48:06.843,That must be what I-- What I want.
00:48:06.843,00:48:10.346,"You know, to be on the night shift, driving somebody else's cab."
00:48:10.346,00:48:12.139,You understand?
00:48:12.139,00:48:16.143,"I mean, you-- You-- You become-- You get a job, you-- You become the job."
00:48:16.143,00:48:20.022,"I mean, one guy lives in Brooklyn, one guy lives in Sutton Place."
00:48:20.022,00:48:22.983,"You get a lawyer, another guy's a doctor."
00:48:22.983,00:48:28.072,"Another guy dies, another guy gets well, and, you know, people are born."
00:48:28.072,00:48:31.200,"I envy you, your youth."
00:48:31.200,00:48:32.909,Go out and get laid.
00:48:32.909,00:48:35.079,Get drunk.
00:48:37.623,00:48:39.417,"Because you got no choice, anyway."
00:48:39.417,00:48:40.710,"I mean, we're all fucked."
00:48:42.086,00:48:43.838,"More or less, you know?"
00:48:48.551,00:48:52.012,"Yeah, I don't know. That's about the dumbest thing I ever heard."
00:48:53.681,00:48:55.600,"It's not Bertrand Russell, but what do you want?"
00:48:55.600,00:48:58.603,"I'm a cabbie, you know?"
00:48:58.603,00:49:00.855,"I mean, I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about."
00:49:00.855,00:49:04.901,"Yeah, I-- I don't know."
00:49:04.901,00:49:08.070,Don't worry so much.
00:49:08.070,00:49:10.489,"Relax, Killer, you're gonna be all right."
00:49:10.489,00:49:13.826,"I know. I've seen a lot of people, and, uh..."
00:49:13.826,00:49:15.994,I know.
00:49:16.995,00:49:18.456,"Okay. Thanks, man."
00:49:18.456,00:49:21.125,I'll see you.
00:49:23.795,00:49:25.254,Yeah.
00:49:25.254,00:49:26.923,You're all right.
00:49:44.899,00:49:49.862,What do you think of your opponent Goodwin's chances in the up-and-coming primary?
00:49:49.862,00:49:51.447,"Well, Mr. Goodwin is a fine man."
00:49:51.447,00:49:57.994,"I would certainly, if it came to it, prefer him to our opponent in the other party."
00:49:57.994,00:50:01.540,I think that my programs are better defined than his.
00:50:01.540,00:50:05.294,"They're more imaginative than his, and moreover, I have a better chance of winning."
00:50:05.294,00:50:08.547,"I think it's academic, though, because he's not going to win the primary. I am."
00:50:08.547,00:50:11.258,HOST: I see.
00:50:11.258,00:50:14.929,"Well, one more thing I'd like to ask you, ask about the campaign."
00:50:14.929,00:50:16.722,How do you feel it's going?
00:50:16.722,00:50:25.648,"When we came up with our slogan We are the people, when I said Let the people rule, I felt that I was being somewhat overly optimistic."
00:50:25.648,00:50:29.527,I must tell you that I am more optimistic now than ever before.
00:50:29.527,00:50:33.364,The people are rising to the demands that I have made on them.
00:50:33.364,00:50:36.283,The people are beginning to rule.
00:50:36.283,00:50:38.118,I feel it is a groundswell.
00:50:38.118,00:50:40.830,I know it will continue through the primary.
00:50:40.830,00:50:42.206,I know it will continue at Miami.
00:50:42.206,00:50:48.128,And I know it will rise to an unprecedented swell in November.
00:52:14.048,00:52:16.634,"MAN: That bitch, goddamn!"
00:52:16.634,00:52:18.761,"I'll kill her, goddamn it!"
00:52:18.761,00:52:21.055,"I'm gonna get my hands on her, I'll kill her!"
00:52:21.055,00:52:22.473,"Shoot, goddamn it! Fucker!"
00:52:22.473,00:52:26.310,"MAN: I swear if I get my hands on her, I'll kill that fucking bitch!"
00:52:26.310,00:52:28.144,I'm gonna get my hands on her.
00:52:28.144,00:52:29.939,"Hey, Sport."
00:52:29.939,00:52:31.899,MAN: I'll kill her! Damn it!
00:52:31.899,00:52:33.317,That guy keeps following us.
00:52:33.317,00:52:34.819,Don't look at him.
00:52:51.585,00:52:53.045,"Hey, guys."
00:52:55.923,00:52:58.425,You wanna take a walk?
00:53:10.021,00:53:14.358,"BICKLE: Loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere."
00:53:14.358,00:53:19.989,"In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere."
00:53:19.989,00:53:22.533,There's no escape.
00:53:22.533,00:53:25.786,I'm God's lonely man.
00:53:29.289,00:53:31.042,June 8th.
00:53:31.042,00:53:34.045,My life has taken another turn again.
00:53:34.045,00:53:40.425,"The days move along with regularity, over and over, one day indistinguishable from the next."
00:53:40.425,00:53:43.054,"A long, continuous chain."
00:53:43.054,00:53:46.682,"And then suddenly, there is a change."
00:54:01.947,00:54:03.615,"Hey, Travis, this here's Easy Andy."
00:54:03.615,00:54:04.909,He's a traveling salesman.
00:54:04.909,00:54:06.368,"How you doing, Travis?"
00:54:29.808,00:54:31.267,You got a .44 Magnum?
00:54:31.267,00:54:32.853,It's an expensive weapon.
00:54:32.853,00:54:35.147,That's all right.
00:54:35.147,00:54:37.273,It's a real monster.
00:54:37.273,00:54:40.736,"Stop a car at 100 yards, put a round right through the engine block."
00:54:52.706,00:54:54.917,Here you go.
00:54:54.917,00:54:56.877,"It's a premium, high-resale weapon."
00:55:01.715,00:55:03.801,Look at that.
00:55:03.801,00:55:06.678,Look at that.
00:55:11.016,00:55:14.770,I could sell this gun to some jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.
00:55:14.770,00:55:18.565,But I just deal high-quality goods to the right people.
00:55:20.316,00:55:22.069,How about that?
00:55:22.069,00:55:24.947,This might be a little too big for practical purposes.
00:55:24.947,00:55:27.491,"In which case, for you, I'd recommend..."
00:55:27.491,00:55:29.743,.38 snub-nose.
00:55:31.620,00:55:33.164,Look at this.
00:55:34.790,00:55:37.835,Look at that.
00:55:37.835,00:55:43.048,"It's nickel-plated with a snub-nose, otherwise the same as a service revolver."
00:55:43.048,00:55:45.717,That'll stop anything that moves.
00:55:45.717,00:55:48.887,"The Magnum, they use that in Africa for killing elephants."
00:55:48.887,00:55:52.141,"That .38, that's a funny gun."
00:55:57.313,00:55:59.898,Some of these guns are like toys.
00:55:59.898,00:56:06.780,"That .38, you go out and hammer nails with her all day, come back and it'll cut dead center on target every time."
00:56:06.780,00:56:10.659,It's got a really nice action to it and a heck of a wallop.
00:56:12.744,00:56:15.039,You interested in an automatic?
00:56:15.039,00:56:18.334,It's a Colt .25 automatic.
00:56:19.543,00:56:21.253,It's a beautiful little gun.
00:56:21.253,00:56:23.672,"Holds six shots in the clip, one shot in the chamber."
00:56:23.672,00:56:25.966,That's if you're dumb enough to put a round in the chamber.
00:56:27.509,00:56:29.845,Here. Look at this.
00:56:29.845,00:56:31.930,.380 Walther.
00:56:31.930,00:56:34.099,Holds eight shots in the clip.
00:56:35.142,00:56:37.519,That's a nice gun.
00:56:37.519,00:56:39.897,That's a beautiful little gun.
00:56:43.525,00:56:46.820,"During World War II, they used this gun to replace the P 38."
00:56:48.239,00:56:50.657,Just given out to officers.
00:56:56.330,00:56:58.332,Ain't that a little honey?
00:57:06.464,00:57:08.675,How much for everything?
00:57:08.675,00:57:10.094,All together?
00:57:10.094,00:57:13.722,"Well, only a jackass would carry that cannon in the streets like that."
00:57:13.722,00:57:15.515,Here.
00:57:15.515,00:57:19.228,Here's a beautiful handmade holster I had made in Mexico.
00:57:19.228,00:57:21.605,Forty dollars.
00:57:21.605,00:57:28.695,"Three-fifty for the Magnum, 250 for the .38, one and a quarter for the .25, 150 for the .380."
00:57:28.695,00:57:32.074,You take this and wait here.
00:57:32.074,00:57:35.911,How 'bout dope? Grass?
00:57:35.911,00:57:39.790,Mescaline? Downers? Nembutal?
00:57:39.790,00:57:41.875,"How 'bout uppers, amphetamines?"
00:57:41.875,00:57:43.919,"No, I'm not interested in that stuff."
00:57:43.919,00:57:46.713,"Crystal meth. I can get you crystal meth, nitrous oxide."
00:57:46.713,00:57:51.343,"How 'bout a Cadillac? I can get you a brand-new Cadillac, with the pink slip, for 2 grand."
00:57:59.476,00:58:01.561,BICKLE: June 29th.
00:58:01.561,00:58:03.688,I gotta get in shape now.
00:58:03.688,00:58:05.274,Too much sitting has ruined my body.
00:58:05.274,00:58:08.068,Too much abuse has gone on for too long.
00:58:08.068,00:58:10.862,"From now on, it'll be 50 pushups each morning."
00:58:10.862,00:58:14.199,Fifty pull-ups.
00:58:14.199,00:58:18.870,"There will be no more bad food, no more destroyers of my body."
00:58:18.870,00:58:21.039,"From now on, it'll be total organization."
00:58:21.039,00:58:23.041,Every muscle must be tight.
00:58:37.806,00:58:39.141,Wow.
00:58:39.141,00:58:41.185,Look at the size of that.
00:58:41.185,00:58:44.980,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
00:58:44.980,00:58:47.399,"Oh, it looks so good."
00:58:47.399,00:58:49.526,Mm.
00:58:50.777,00:58:52.321,Mm.
00:58:52.321,00:58:56.533,"It's getting harder and harder, and it's throbbing now."
00:58:56.533,00:58:58.660,Oh.
00:58:58.660,00:59:02.789,BICKLE: The idea had been growing in my brain for some time.
00:59:02.789,00:59:05.167,True force.
00:59:05.167,00:59:09.046,All the king's men cannot put it back together again.
01:01:10.417,01:01:11.876,Where do we get more of these?
01:01:11.876,01:01:13.629,Where do you think you're supposed to get more?
01:01:13.629,01:01:14.796,Back at headquarters.
01:01:14.796,01:01:16.840,All the way back there to get them?
01:01:16.840,01:01:18.758,Come on.
01:01:18.758,01:01:21.470,Maybe it's the speakers.
01:01:21.470,01:01:23.888,You've done this before?
01:01:23.888,01:01:25.265,When was the last time you did this?
01:01:25.265,01:01:26.808,I've never done this before.
01:01:26.808,01:01:28.185,Betsy!
01:01:28.185,01:01:30.895,Betsy!
01:01:30.895,01:01:33.857,"TOM: Betsy. Come here, come here."
01:02:28.579,01:02:30.205,Hey.
01:02:32.332,01:02:35.293,"Hey, you're a Secret Service man, aren't you?"
01:02:35.293,01:02:37.254,Huh?
01:02:37.254,01:02:40.048,Just waiting for the senator.
01:02:40.048,01:02:42.551,You're waiting for the senator?
01:02:42.551,01:02:44.010,Oh.
01:02:46.137,01:02:48.515,That's a very good answer.
01:02:48.515,01:02:51.851,Shit.
01:02:51.851,01:02:53.520,I'm waiting for the sun to shine.
01:02:53.520,01:02:55.647,Yeah.
01:02:55.647,01:03:01.612,"No, the reason I-- I asked if you were a Secret Service man-- I won't say anything."
01:03:01.612,01:03:09.578,--is 'cause I-- I saw some suspicious-looking people over there.
01:03:09.578,01:03:10.954,You did?
01:03:10.954,01:03:12.289,I don't know...
01:03:17.461,01:03:19.796,They were just here.
01:03:23.174,01:03:25.385,"They were very, very, uh..."
01:03:25.385,01:03:27.053,Suspicious.
01:03:30.348,01:03:33.059,Where'd he go?
01:03:33.059,01:03:35.771,Is it hard to get to be in the Secret Service?
01:03:35.771,01:03:38.148,Why?
01:03:35.771,01:03:40.275,"Well, I was just curious, 'cause I think I'd be good at it."
01:03:40.275,01:03:42.402,I'm very observant.
01:03:42.402,01:03:45.489,"I was in the Marine Corps, you know."
01:03:45.489,01:03:46.990,I'm good with crowds.
01:03:49.993,01:03:53.371,I noticed your little pin there.
01:03:53.371,01:03:54.872,Sort of.
01:03:54.872,01:03:58.794,A signal. A secret signal for a Secret Service.
01:04:02.380,01:04:04.882,"Hey, what kind of guns you guys carry?"
01:04:04.882,01:04:09.971,.38s? .45s? .357 Magnums?
01:04:09.971,01:04:17.020,"Hey, look, uh, if you're really interested, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you all the information on how to apply."
01:04:17.020,01:04:18.355,How's that?
01:04:20.982,01:04:22.317,You will?
01:04:22.317,01:04:24.235,Okay.
01:04:24.235,01:04:25.737,Why not?
01:04:29.407,01:04:35.079,My name is Henry Krinkle. K-R-I-N-K-L-E.
01:04:38.667,01:04:42.629,154 Hopper Avenue.
01:04:42.629,01:04:44.715,Hopper?
01:04:47.342,01:04:49.511,"You know, like a rabbit?"
01:04:52.972,01:04:55.016,"Fair Lawn, New Jersey."
01:04:57.769,01:04:59.229,"Is there a zip code with that, Henry?"
01:04:59.229,01:05:02.190,"Yeah, 6-1-0-4-5-2."
01:05:04.651,01:05:06.611,Okay?
01:05:06.611,01:05:08.196,"Six, one..."
01:05:09.531,01:05:12.868,"Oh, well, 6-1-0-4-5."
01:05:12.868,01:05:15.036,Okay.
01:05:15.036,01:05:18.206,I was thinking of my telephone number.
01:05:18.206,01:05:19.750,"Well, I've got it all."
01:05:19.750,01:05:22.753,"Henry, we'll get all the stuff right out to you."
01:05:22.753,01:05:26.297,"Thanks a lot. Hey, great."
01:05:26.297,01:05:28.383,Be careful today.
01:05:28.383,01:05:31.803,You have to be careful around a place like this. Bye.
01:05:40.395,01:05:42.898,Damn it!
01:06:04.252,01:06:06.254,Yeah.
01:06:06.254,01:06:08.172,Huh?
01:06:08.172,01:06:09.925,Huh? Huh?
01:06:09.925,01:06:13.428,"Faster than you, you fucking sick..."
01:06:13.428,01:06:16.306,"I saw you coming, you fuck."
01:06:16.306,01:06:17.766,Shitheel.
01:06:21.311,01:06:24.522,I'm standing here.
01:06:24.522,01:06:26.566,You make the move.
01:06:26.566,01:06:28.318,It's your move.
01:06:30.236,01:06:31.488,Huh?
01:06:31.488,01:06:33.156,"Don't try it, you fuck."
01:06:40.079,01:06:41.414,You talking to me?
01:06:43.917,01:06:45.627,You talking to me?
01:06:47.921,01:06:49.255,You talking to me?
01:06:51.758,01:06:53.802,"Well, then who the hell else are you talking to?"
01:06:53.802,01:06:56.012,You talking to me?
01:06:56.012,01:06:57.639,"Well, I'm the only one here."
01:06:59.724,01:07:03.561,Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
01:07:03.561,01:07:05.021,"Oh, yeah?"
01:07:05.021,01:07:06.940,Eh?
01:07:06.940,01:07:08.441,Okay.
01:07:10.276,01:07:12.904,Huh?
01:07:16.324,01:07:18.910,"BICKLE: Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads."
01:07:18.910,01:07:21.788,Here is a man who would not take it anymore.
01:07:21.788,01:07:26.793,"Who would not let-- Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads."
01:07:26.793,01:07:30.797,Here is a man who would not take it anymore.
01:07:30.797,01:07:35.593,"A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit."
01:07:35.593,01:07:38.722,Here is someone who stood up.
01:07:38.722,01:07:40.598,Here is...
01:07:40.598,01:07:42.017,Huh?
01:07:45.520,01:07:47.104,You're dead.
01:08:13.297,01:08:14.549,"Hey, Travis."
01:08:15.675,01:08:17.260,"Hi, Melio. ¿Qué pasa?"
01:08:17.260,01:08:19.262,All right.
01:08:27.687,01:08:28.939,"MELIO: Yeah, man?"
01:08:28.939,01:08:32.442,"MAN: Okay, shut your fucking mouth and give me the cash out the drawer. Come on!"
01:08:32.442,01:08:34.318,Come on!
01:08:34.318,01:08:36.947,Let's go. Give me the damn cash.
01:08:36.947,01:08:39.365,MAN: Stop taking so long.
01:08:39.365,01:08:41.785,Let me have it. Give me-- Give me the bread.
01:08:41.785,01:08:43.202,This all you got?
01:08:43.202,01:08:44.955,MAN: Reach in your sock and get the rest.
01:08:44.955,01:08:46.330,MELIO: I don't have any more.
01:08:46.330,01:08:48.291,MELIO: That's all I got!
01:08:48.291,01:08:50.085,MELIO: I'm tellin' ya!
01:08:50.085,01:08:51.502,You got more bread.
01:08:51.502,01:08:53.671,Give me the rest of the bread.
01:08:58.718,01:09:00.053,Did you get him?
01:09:00.053,01:09:02.013,"Yeah, I got him."
01:09:05.850,01:09:08.686,"Shit, man."
01:09:10.021,01:09:11.439,Is he dead?
01:09:11.439,01:09:13.483,I don't know.
01:09:19.196,01:09:21.365,"Hey, listen, I ain't got a permit for this thing."
01:09:21.365,01:09:22.867,I don't know what I'm gonna do.
01:09:27.455,01:09:29.248,"Don't worry about it, man."
01:09:29.248,01:09:31.835,Can I give you some money?
01:09:31.835,01:09:34.045,"No, man. I'll take care of it. Go ahead."
01:09:34.045,01:09:35.839,Yeah?
01:09:38.758,01:09:41.511,It's the fifth motherfucker this year!
01:11:26.532,01:11:35.374,"Walt Whitman, that great American poet, spoke for all of us when he said: I am the man. I suffered."
01:11:35.374,01:11:36.960,I was there.
01:11:36.960,01:11:42.673,Today I say to you: We are the people.
01:11:42.673,01:11:44.134,We were there.
01:11:47.220,01:11:50.389,"PALANTINE: We, the people, suffered in Vietnam."
01:11:50.389,01:11:52.767,"We, the people, suffered."
01:11:52.767,01:11:59.023,"We still suffer from unemployment, inflation, crime and corruption."
01:12:02.277,01:12:13.997,"BICKLE: Dear Father and Mother, July is the month I remember which brings not only your wedding anniversary, but also Father's Day and Mother's birthday."
01:12:13.997,01:12:20.878,"And I'm sorry I can't remember the exact dates, but I hope this card will take care of them all."
01:12:20.878,01:12:27.260,"I'm sorry, again, I cannot send you my address like I promised to last year."
01:12:27.260,01:12:32.807,But the sensitive nature of my work for the government demands utmost secrecy.
01:12:32.807,01:12:35.893,I know you will understand.
01:12:35.893,01:12:39.272,I am healthy and well and making lots of money.
01:12:39.272,01:12:44.443,"I have been going with a girl for several months, and I know you would be proud if you could see her."
01:12:44.443,01:12:48.781,"Her name is Betsy, but I can tell you no more than that."
01:12:48.781,01:12:51.159,"Hey, cabbie, you can't park here."
01:12:52.869,01:12:55.746,"Come on! Come on, let's go!"
01:12:55.746,01:13:02.212,"No more will we, the people, bear the burden of suffering for the few."
01:13:02.212,01:13:07.884,No more will we fight the wars of the few through the heart of the many.
01:13:11.595,01:13:15.766,"BICKLE: I hope this card finds you all well, as it does me."
01:13:15.766,01:13:19.645,I hope no one has died.
01:13:19.645,01:13:23.440,"One day there will be a knock on the door, and it'll be me."
01:13:23.440,01:13:25.318,"Love, Travis."
01:13:32.783,01:13:34.244,Don't you have some idea?
01:13:34.244,01:13:36.620,I'm not the one who wants to talk.
01:13:36.620,01:13:43.753,WOMAN: But you must know that the reason that I didn't marry him is because I couldn't stand to be a cause of divorce.
01:13:43.753,01:13:45.129,And...
01:13:47.423,01:13:51.386,"Now he's getting a divorce anyway, and, uh..."
01:13:54.389,01:13:56.766,"Phillip wants to marry me, Brock."
01:14:00.103,01:14:02.146,I do love him.
01:14:05.108,01:14:07.902,"W-- What about us, June?"
01:14:09.612,01:14:11.030,Our marriage?
01:14:14.200,01:14:17.203,You gotta know that our marriage wasn't legal.
01:14:17.203,01:14:19.247,"In the eyes of God, we are married."
01:14:21.707,01:14:26.629,"Brock, please don't do this to me."
01:14:28.381,01:14:40.017,I love him so-- Damn.
01:14:41.811,01:14:43.646,Goddamn.
01:15:18.264,01:15:19.640,They trying to get in the picture.
01:15:24.228,01:15:25.938,You looking for some action?
01:15:25.938,01:15:27.231,Yeah.
01:15:30.943,01:15:32.236,You see that guy over there?
01:15:32.236,01:15:33.737,Yeah.
01:15:33.737,01:15:36.573,All right. You go talk to him.
01:15:36.573,01:15:38.368,I'll be over there waiting for you.
01:15:38.368,01:15:39.952,Okay.
01:15:39.952,01:15:47.584,MATTHEW: Your name Matthew?
01:15:47.584,01:15:49.253,Officer.
01:15:50.421,01:15:52.382,I swear I'm clean.
01:15:52.382,01:15:54.258,I'm just waiting here for a friend.
01:15:54.258,01:15:57.178,"You gonna bust me for nothing, man?"
01:15:57.178,01:15:59.389,I'm not a cop.
01:15:57.178,01:16:01.432,I ain't a-- Then why are you asking me for action?
01:16:04.477,01:16:05.895,Because she sent me over.
01:16:08.981,01:16:11.692,I suppose that ain't a .38 you've got in your sock.
01:16:11.692,01:16:13.277,A .38? No. Nah.
01:16:14.945,01:16:16.322,"I'm clean, man."
01:16:17.948,01:16:19.534,"Shit, you're a real cowboy?"
01:16:19.534,01:16:20.993,Yeah.
01:16:20.993,01:16:23.246,"That's nice, man."
01:16:23.246,01:16:24.414,That's all right.
01:16:24.414,01:16:26.123,"Fifteen dollars, 15 minutes."
01:16:26.123,01:16:28.042,"Twenty-five dollars, half an hour."
01:16:29.710,01:16:31.712,"Oh, shit."
01:16:31.712,01:16:33.214,"A cowboy, huh?"
01:16:34.840,01:16:37.301,I once had a horse.
01:16:37.301,01:16:38.886,She got hit by a car.
01:16:41.556,01:16:43.766,"Well, take it or leave it."
01:16:43.766,01:16:46.810,"If you wanna save yourself some money, don't fuck her."
01:16:46.810,01:16:48.979,Because you'll be back here every night for some more.
01:16:48.979,01:16:50.398,She's 12 and a half years old.
01:16:50.398,01:16:52.149,You ain't never had no pussy like that.
01:16:53.359,01:16:54.902,You can do anything you want with her.
01:16:54.902,01:16:59.073,"You can come on her, fuck her in the mouth, fuck her in the ass."
01:16:59.073,01:17:02.076,"She'll get your cock so hard, she'll make it explode."
01:17:04.537,01:17:07.164,But no rough stuff.
01:17:12.462,01:17:14.838,"All right, I'll take it."
01:17:14.838,01:17:18.092,"Hey, man! Don't take out no money over here."
01:17:18.092,01:17:19.676,You wanna fuck me?
01:17:19.676,01:17:21.429,You ain't gonna fuck me.
01:17:19.676,01:17:23.139,"You're gonna fuck her, you give her the money."
01:17:24.515,01:17:26.934,"Catch you later, copper."
01:17:26.934,01:17:28.102,What'd you say?
01:17:28.102,01:17:29.520,"I'll see you later, copper."
01:17:31.647,01:17:33.023,"I'm no cop, man."
01:17:33.023,01:17:36.944,"Well, if you are, it's entrapment already."
01:17:38.070,01:17:39.489,Huh?
01:17:40.615,01:17:41.865,I'm hip.
01:17:43.117,01:17:44.827,"Funny, you don't look hip."
01:17:48.498,01:17:51.542,"Go ahead. Have yourself a good time. Go ahead, man."
01:18:00.259,01:18:01.594,You're a funny guy.
01:18:05.473,01:18:07.850,But looks aren't everything.
01:18:07.850,01:18:10.353,"Go ahead, man."
01:18:10.353,01:18:11.646,Uh...
01:18:14.898,01:18:16.609,MATTHEW: You're a funny guy.
01:18:57.107,01:18:59.068,Hey.
01:18:59.068,01:19:01.320,The room'll cost you 10 bucks.
01:19:14.375,01:19:15.751,I'm timing you too.
01:19:35.187,01:19:36.522,Come on.
01:19:46.282,01:19:47.950,"Hey, you really 12 and a half?"
01:19:50.369,01:19:53.789,"Listen, mister, it's your time."
01:19:56.709,01:19:58.961,"When that cigarette burns out, your time is up."
01:20:03.507,01:20:05.718,How old are you?
01:20:07.094,01:20:09.346,You won't tell me?
01:20:09.346,01:20:10.973,What's your name?
01:20:10.973,01:20:12.683,Easy.
01:20:12.683,01:20:14.268,"Well, that's not any kind of name."
01:20:14.268,01:20:15.978,"Well, it's easy to remember."
01:20:15.978,01:20:18.814,"Yeah, but what's your real name?"
01:20:18.814,01:20:20.232,I don't like my real name.
01:20:20.232,01:20:22.485,But what's your real name?
01:20:26.113,01:20:28.031,Iris.
01:20:28.031,01:20:30.242,"Well, what's wrong with that?"
01:20:30.242,01:20:31.994,Ha! That's what you think.
01:20:39.418,01:20:41.003,"No, don't do that."
01:20:41.003,01:20:42.755,Don't you remember me?
01:20:42.755,01:20:45.924,You mean-- You remember when you-- When you got into a taxi?
01:20:45.924,01:20:47.468,It was a checkered taxi.
01:20:47.468,01:20:52.222,You got in and that-- That guy Matthew came by and he said he that wanted to take you away.
01:20:52.222,01:20:53.557,He pulled you away.
01:20:55.309,01:20:56.935,I don't know.
01:20:58.187,01:20:59.438,You don't remember any of that?
01:20:59.438,01:21:02.399,No.
01:21:02.399,01:21:04.234,"Well, that's all right."
01:21:04.234,01:21:07.029,"Listen, we better make it or Sport'll get mad."
01:21:07.029,01:21:08.364,So how do you wanna make it?
01:21:08.364,01:21:10.282,I don't wanna make it.
01:21:10.282,01:21:12.743,"Oh, that's Matthew."
01:21:17.914,01:21:19.458,Wanna make it like this?
01:21:25.548,01:21:28.967,"Listen, I-- I-- I want-- Listen, can't you understand something?"
01:21:28.967,01:21:30.927,"I mean, you're the one that came into my cab."
01:21:30.927,01:21:32.888,You're the one that wanted to get out of here.
01:21:32.888,01:21:34.431,"Well, I must've been stoned."
01:21:34.431,01:21:36.684,Why? What do you mean?
01:21:36.684,01:21:38.185,"Oh, come off it, man."
01:21:39.895,01:21:42.064,What are you doing?
01:21:42.064,01:21:44.233,Don't you wanna make it?
01:21:46.861,01:21:49.572,"No, I don't wanna make it."
01:21:49.572,01:21:51.990,"Well, I could help you."
01:21:56.078,01:21:58.497,"Damn, man!"
01:21:58.497,01:22:00.040,Goddamn it!
01:22:04.253,01:22:08.424,"Shit, man. What the hell's the matter with you?"
01:22:08.424,01:22:10.384,"Listen, we don't have to make it, mister."
01:22:10.384,01:22:12.678,Goddamn it!
01:22:15.097,01:22:17.140,Can't you understand why I came here?
01:22:17.140,01:22:19.685,I-- I think I understand.
01:22:19.685,01:22:21.937,Uh...
01:22:21.937,01:22:26.233,"I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you wanna come and take me away."
01:22:28.026,01:22:29.570,Is that it?
01:22:29.570,01:22:31.822,"Yeah, but don't-- Don't you wanna go?"
01:22:31.822,01:22:33.240,I can leave any time I want to.
01:22:33.240,01:22:35.659,"Well, then what about that one night?"
01:22:37.745,01:22:39.204,"Look, I was stoned."
01:22:42.124,01:22:44.126,That's why they stopped me.
01:22:46.378,01:22:49.298,Because when I'm not stoned I got no place else to go.
01:22:50.424,01:22:55.137,"So they just, uh, protect me from myself."
01:23:00.517,01:23:02.561,No.
01:23:02.561,01:23:04.229,I don't know.
01:23:06.565,01:23:09.234,"I don't know. Okay, I tried."
01:23:09.234,01:23:12.279,"Hey, look, I understand."
01:23:12.279,01:23:14.072,"And it means something, really."
01:23:15.365,01:23:17.033,"Yeah, well."
01:23:18.076,01:23:19.829,"Well, look, can I see you again?"
01:23:19.829,01:23:21.079,Ha. That's not hard to do.
01:23:21.079,01:23:22.372,"No, I don't mean like that."
01:23:22.372,01:23:24.040,"I-- I mean, you know, regularly."
01:23:24.040,01:23:26.836,This is nothing for a person to do.
01:23:26.836,01:23:28.671,All right.
01:23:28.671,01:23:31.006,Tomorrow?
01:23:31.006,01:23:32.299,One o'clock?
01:23:32.299,01:23:33.592,Oh.
01:23:35.970,01:23:38.221,"Well, I got a-- A thing."
01:23:35.970,01:23:39.807,I don't know-- Come on.
01:23:39.807,01:23:42.017,"Yeah, I want-- Okay, all right."
01:23:42.017,01:23:43.769,"Okay, 1:00."
01:23:43.769,01:23:45.771,Okay. See you tomorrow.
01:23:47.397,01:23:50.734,"Oh, Iris."
01:23:51.694,01:23:53.654,"Thanks a lot, Travis."
01:23:55.447,01:23:58.701,"So long, Iris."
01:24:00.285,01:24:01.578,Sweet Iris.
01:24:26.228,01:24:28.230,This is yours.
01:24:28.230,01:24:29.565,Spend it right.
01:24:35.404,01:24:37.280,"Come back anytime, cowboy."
01:24:37.280,01:24:39.366,I will.
01:24:57.927,01:25:00.721,Why do you want me to go back to my parents?
01:25:00.721,01:25:02.598,"I mean, they hate me."
01:25:02.598,01:25:04.934,Why do you think I split in the first place?
01:25:04.934,01:25:06.226,There ain't nothing there.
01:25:06.226,01:25:07.853,"Yeah, but you can't live like this."
01:25:07.853,01:25:09.605,It's a hell.
01:25:09.605,01:25:12.399,A girl should live at home.
01:25:12.399,01:25:14.317,Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
01:25:14.317,01:25:16.528,"What do you mean, women's lib?"
01:25:16.528,01:25:19.823,You're a young girl.
01:25:19.823,01:25:21.992,"You should be dressed up, you should be going out with boys."
01:25:21.992,01:25:23.493,You should be going to school.
01:25:23.493,01:25:24.912,"You know, that kind of stuff."
01:25:24.912,01:25:27.581,"Oh, God, are you square."
01:25:27.581,01:25:29.541,"Hey, I'm not square."
01:25:29.541,01:25:32.962,"You're full of shit, man."
01:25:32.962,01:25:40.302,"You-- You walk out with those fucking creeps and lowlifes and degenerates out on the street and you-- You sell your little pussy for nothing, man?"
01:25:40.302,01:25:42.679,For some lowlife pimp?
01:25:42.679,01:25:44.347,Stands in a hall.
01:25:45.891,01:25:47.225,I'm the--? I'm square?
01:25:47.225,01:25:49.103,"You're the one that's square, man."
01:25:49.103,01:25:52.856,I don't go screw and fuck with a bunch of killers and junkies the way you do.
01:25:52.856,01:25:55.067,You call that being hip?
01:25:56.526,01:25:57.778,What world you from?
01:26:02.532,01:26:04.326,Who's a killer?
01:26:04.326,01:26:06.495,"That guy Sport's a killer, that's who's a killer."
01:26:06.495,01:26:08.080,Sport never killed nobody.
01:26:08.080,01:26:09.748,He killed someone-- He's a Libra.
01:26:09.748,01:26:11.500,He's a what?
01:26:11.500,01:26:14.128,I'm a Libra too.
01:26:16.880,01:26:20.050,He looks like a killer to me.
01:26:20.050,01:26:26.098,"I think that-- That Cancers make the best lovers, but, God, my whole family are air signs."
01:26:26.098,01:26:27.557,He's also a dope-shooter.
01:26:27.557,01:26:30.019,"So, what makes you so high and mighty?"
01:26:30.019,01:26:31.812,Will you tell me that?
01:26:31.812,01:26:35.149,Didn't you ever try looking at your own eyeballs in the mirror?
01:26:41.279,01:26:43.573,"So, what're you gonna do about Sport and that old bastard?"
01:26:43.573,01:26:45.450,When?
01:26:48.787,01:26:50.580,I don't know.
01:26:50.580,01:26:52.749,"Yeah, you just gonna leave?"
01:26:52.749,01:26:55.251,"Yeah, but you just can't do that. What are you gonna do?"
01:26:58.547,01:27:00.132,What do you want me to do?
01:27:00.132,01:27:02.926,"Well, the cops don't do nothing."
01:27:02.926,01:27:05.095,"Hey, look, Sport never treated me bad."
01:27:05.095,01:27:07.181,"I mean, he didn't beat me up or anything like that once."
01:27:07.181,01:27:11.018,But you can't allow him to do the same to other girls.
01:27:11.018,01:27:12.561,You can't allow him to do that.
01:27:12.561,01:27:15.230,He is the lowest kind of person in the world.
01:27:15.230,01:27:17.191,Somebody's got to do something to him.
01:27:17.191,01:27:18.817,He's the scum of the earth.
01:27:18.817,01:27:21.695,He's the worst...
01:27:21.695,01:27:24.489,"sucking scum I have ever, ever seen."
01:27:26.825,01:27:29.494,You know what he told me about you?
01:27:31.663,01:27:35.084,He called you names. He called you a little piece of chicken.
01:27:37.002,01:27:40.839,He does-- He-- He doesn't mean it.
01:27:42.298,01:27:45.052,I'll move up to one of them communes in Vermont.
01:27:50.140,01:27:53.227,"I never seen a commune before, but I don't know, you know."
01:27:53.227,01:27:55.478,I saw...
01:27:55.478,01:27:57.022,some pictures once in a magazine.
01:27:57.022,01:27:59.024,It didn't look very clean.
01:27:59.024,01:28:01.526,"Well, why don't you come to the commune with me?"
01:28:01.526,01:28:05.363,"What? Come-- Come to the commune with you? No, no."
01:28:05.363,01:28:06.656,Why not?
01:28:08.658,01:28:11.578,"Uh, I don't-- I don't go to places like that."
01:28:11.578,01:28:12.996,"Oh, come on, why not?"
01:28:12.996,01:28:14.957,I don't get along with people like that.
01:28:14.957,01:28:16.792,Are you a Scorpion?
01:28:16.792,01:28:18.668,What?
01:28:18.668,01:28:20.003,I can tell every time.
01:28:21.755,01:28:24.049,"Besides, I gotta stay here."
01:28:24.049,01:28:25.300,Come on. Why?
01:28:25.300,01:28:27.010,I got something very important to do.
01:28:27.010,01:28:28.929,"Well, so, what's so important?"
01:28:30.597,01:28:32.141,I'm doing something for the government.
01:28:33.642,01:28:36.103,The cab thing is just part-time.
01:28:36.103,01:28:38.814,Are you a narc?
01:28:40.983,01:28:42.400,Do I look like a narc?
01:28:42.400,01:28:44.027,Yeah.
01:28:44.027,01:28:46.321,I am a narc.
01:28:48.323,01:28:51.701,"God! I don't know who's weirder, you or me."
01:28:57.373,01:28:59.876,"You sure you don't wanna come with me, huh?"
01:28:59.876,01:29:02.296,"Well, I'll tell you what."
01:29:02.296,01:29:03.922,"Oh, no. Look, you don't have to do that."
01:29:03.922,01:29:05.507,"No, no. I want you to take it."
01:29:05.507,01:29:08.551,I don't want you to take anything from them.
01:29:08.551,01:29:10.846,And I wanna do it.
01:29:10.846,01:29:13.389,I don't have anything better to do with my money.
01:29:15.142,01:29:17.560,And I might be going away for a while.
01:29:42.544,01:29:45.088,"You're just a little tense, that's all."
01:29:46.589,01:29:49.509,"I don't like what I'm doing, Sport."
01:29:49.509,01:29:52.428,"Oh, baby, I never wanted you to like what you're doing."
01:29:52.428,01:29:55.807,"If you ever liked what you were doing, you wouldn't be my woman."
01:29:58.101,01:30:00.896,You never spend any time with me anymore.
01:30:00.896,01:30:03.190,"Well, I got to attend to business, baby."
01:30:04.900,01:30:06.985,"You miss your man, don't you?"
01:30:08.862,01:30:10.989,I don't like to be away from you either.
01:30:12.406,01:30:14.534,You know how I feel about you.
01:30:16.161,01:30:17.620,I depend on you.
01:30:20.582,01:30:21.958,I'd be lost without you.
01:30:23.168,01:30:25.254,Don't you ever forget that.
01:30:35.013,01:30:36.639,How much I need you.
01:30:39.475,01:30:40.936,"Come to me, baby."
01:30:51.405,01:30:52.906,Let me hold you.
01:30:59.704,01:31:03.875,"Oh, when you're close to me like this, I feel so good."
01:31:08.755,01:31:12.675,I only wish every man could know what it's like to be loved by you.
01:31:18.181,01:31:25.439,"That every woman, everywhere, had a man who loves her like I love you."
01:31:29.943,01:31:32.862,"God, it's good so close."
01:31:45.250,01:31:50.005,"You know, at times like this, I know I am a lucky man."
01:31:53.467,01:31:56.886,Touching a woman who wants me and needs me.
01:32:02.476,01:32:05.437,"Yeah, it's only you that keeps me together."
01:33:38.071,01:33:39.655,BICKLE: Now I see it clearly.
01:33:39.655,01:33:42.451,My whole life has pointed in one direction.
01:33:42.451,01:33:44.869,I see that now.
01:33:44.869,01:33:48.039,There never has been any choice for me.
01:34:23.158,01:34:28.913,"Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Senator Charles Palantine."
01:34:35.253,01:34:38.006,"Thank you, Tom."
01:34:38.006,01:34:44.429,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are met today at a crossroads, Columbus Circle."
01:34:44.429,01:34:47.098,This is no ordinary place.
01:34:47.098,01:34:51.769,It is a place where many roads and many lives intersect.
01:34:53.021,01:34:59.319,"It is appropriate that we meet here today, because these are not ordinary times."
01:34:59.319,01:35:03.823,We meet at a crossroads in history.
01:35:03.823,01:35:07.910,"For far too long, the wrong roads have been taken."
01:35:07.910,01:35:15.960,"The wrong roads have led us into war, into poverty, into unemployment and inflation."
01:35:15.960,01:35:20.048,"Today I say to you, we have reached the turning point."
01:35:23.759,01:35:27.972,"No longer will we, the people, suffer for the few."
01:35:36.105,01:35:40.443,"Now, I would lie to you if I told you the new roads would be easy."
01:35:40.443,01:35:43.613,They will not be easy.
01:35:43.613,01:35:47.158,Nothing that is right and good has ever been easy.
01:35:47.158,01:35:48.660,"We, the people, know that."
01:35:53.415,01:35:57.335,"And we, the people, know the right roads and the good."
01:35:57.335,01:36:03.132,"Today I say to you, we are the people, you and I."
01:36:03.132,01:36:06.261,And it is time to let the people rule!
01:36:06.261,01:36:08.722,Thank you.
01:36:23.945,01:36:26.281,"All right, let him through."
01:36:30.660,01:36:32.828,MAN: Palantine.
01:36:40.629,01:36:42.631,"PALANTINE: Yeah, thank you. Thank you."
01:36:47.552,01:36:48.720,Over there. Get that man.
01:36:50.597,01:36:53.600,MAN: Give him some air!
01:36:53.600,01:36:55.518,"Give him some air, will you?"
01:36:55.518,01:36:57.520,AGENT 1: I never saw him.
01:36:57.520,01:36:59.648,AGENT 3: I saw him.
01:37:25.881,01:37:27.634,"Hey, what's happening?"
01:37:27.634,01:37:29.093,Got the money?
01:37:40.062,01:37:41.397,Iris in her room?
01:37:41.397,01:37:42.691,Okay.
01:38:18.892,01:38:20.854,"Hey, Sport, how you doing?"
01:38:20.854,01:38:22.480,"Okay, okay, my man."
01:38:24.607,01:38:25.899,"Where do I know you from, man?"
01:38:25.899,01:38:27.694,I don't know.
01:38:27.694,01:38:30.864,"How's everything in the pimp business, huh?"
01:38:30.864,01:38:32.323,Huh?
01:38:32.323,01:38:33.616,No.
01:38:33.616,01:38:35.410,Do I know you?
01:38:35.410,01:38:37.328,Get out of here.
01:38:37.328,01:38:39.288,Do I know you?
01:38:41.207,01:38:42.834,How's Iris?
01:38:42.834,01:38:44.544,You know Iris.
01:38:44.544,01:38:47.422,"No, I don't know nobody named Iris."
01:38:47.422,01:38:50.174,"Iris? Come on, get out of here, man."
01:38:50.174,01:38:52.301,You don't know anybody by the name of Iris?
01:38:52.301,01:38:54.804,I don't know nobody named Iris.
01:38:54.804,01:38:56.431,No?
01:38:56.431,01:38:59.183,"Hey, get back to your fucking tribe before you get hurt."
01:38:59.183,01:39:02.103,"Do me a favor. I don't want no trouble, huh? Okay?"
01:39:03.479,01:39:06.274,You got a gun?
01:39:06.274,01:39:09.736,"Get the fuck out of here, man."
01:39:09.736,01:39:11.112,Suck on this.
01:39:11.112,01:39:14.323,Oh--! Oh--! Oh!
01:39:46.272,01:39:47.607,Hey!
01:40:25.770,01:40:29.482,You crazy son of a bitch.
01:40:29.482,01:40:31.776,I'll kill you.
01:40:31.776,01:40:34.278,I'll kill you.
01:40:34.278,01:40:37.740,I'll kill you.
01:40:37.740,01:40:39.909,Crazy son of a bitch.
01:40:57.301,01:40:59.052,Crazy son of a bitch.
01:40:59.052,01:41:02.724,You fucking bastard.
01:41:02.724,01:41:06.268,You crazy son of a bitch.
01:41:06.268,01:41:09.271,I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
01:41:09.271,01:41:12.567,I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
01:41:12.567,01:41:14.610,IRIS: Stop!
01:41:26.748,01:41:28.624,IRIS: No! Don't shoot him!
01:46:07.820,01:46:16.954,MAN: Dear Mr. Bickle: I can't say how happy Mrs. Steensma and I were to hear that you are well and recuperating.
01:46:16.954,01:46:25.838,"We tried to visit you at the hospital when we were in New York to pick up Iris, but you were still in a coma."
01:46:25.838,01:46:31.552,There is no way we can repay you for returning our Iris to us.
01:46:31.552,01:46:36.974,"We thought we had lost her, and now our lives are full again."
01:46:36.974,01:46:43.856,"Needless to say, you are something of a hero around this household."
01:46:43.856,01:46:47.484,I'm sure you want to know about Iris.
01:46:47.484,01:46:51.530,She's back in school and working hard.
01:46:51.530,01:46:56.827,"The transition has been very hard for her, as you can well imagine."
01:46:56.827,01:47:04.043,But we have taken steps to see she has never cause to run away again.
01:47:04.043,01:47:12.634,"In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I would like to again thank you from the bottom of our hearts."
01:47:12.634,01:47:20.935,"Unfortunately, we cannot afford to come to New York again to thank you in person, or we surely would."
01:47:20.935,01:47:28.859,"But if you should ever come to Pittsburgh, you would find yourself a most welcome guest in our home."
01:47:28.859,01:47:34.782,"Our deepest thanks, Burt and Ivy Steensma."
01:47:34.782,01:47:39.452,"Eddie, the owner-operator, comes up, he says, Hey, I wanna swap tires."
01:47:39.452,01:47:41.330,"I say, Hey, these are new tires."
01:47:41.330,01:47:44.792,"Why not throw in something else, like your wife?"
01:47:44.792,01:47:46.919,His wife was Miss New Jersey of 1957.
01:47:46.919,01:47:49.088,That's why the fleet has no spares.
01:47:49.088,01:47:51.548,"Doughboy, Wizard, Killer."
01:47:51.548,01:47:54.509,Charlie T.
01:47:54.509,01:47:56.429,"Hey, Travis, you got a fare."
01:47:57.972,01:48:00.057,Shit.
01:48:00.057,01:48:01.767,"Well, see you later."
01:48:01.767,01:48:03.060,"See you, Travis."
01:48:24.539,01:48:26.250,"BETSY: Hello, Travis."
01:48:27.626,01:48:29.086,Hello.
01:48:50.107,01:48:52.609,I hear Palantine got the nomination.
01:48:54.153,01:48:57.072,"Yeah, won't be long now."
01:48:58.115,01:48:59.992,"Well, I hope he wins."
01:49:13.672,01:49:16.967,I read about you in the papers.
01:49:19.594,01:49:22.223,"Oh, it was nothing, really."
01:49:24.933,01:49:27.269,The papers always blow these things up.
01:49:27.269,01:49:29.271,Mm.
01:49:29.271,01:49:32.649,Just a little stiffness.
01:50:08.643,01:50:10.603,Travis.
01:50:16.444,01:50:18.153,How much was it?
01:50:27.079,01:50:28.539,So long.
