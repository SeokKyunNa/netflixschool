00:01:29.255,00:01:33.426,"This is the most important discovery of the century, and everyone wants to see it."
00:01:33.510,00:01:34.886,"Yes, the press will be there."
00:01:34.969,00:01:36.805,"This is your big day, Mr. Burnish."
00:01:36.888,00:01:38.890,You won't be disappointed. I promise.
00:01:40.433,00:01:42.769,"Easy. Easy, boy."
00:01:45.480,00:01:47.315,Who left the enclosure open?
00:01:48.066,00:01:48.983,Stay back!
00:02:13.675,00:02:16.928,"All right, move in slowly."
00:02:19.722,00:02:22.142,No sudden movements.
00:02:27.397,00:02:28.982,What's happening?
00:02:34.529,00:02:35.446,Oh!
00:02:40.451,00:02:44.205,Um... Who's telling Mr. Burnish?
00:04:14.796,00:04:16.172,"-Number two, extra spicy. -Xie xie."
00:04:16.256,00:04:20.760,"Nah. I'm going out with Peilin, but maybe I'll stop by."
00:04:25.431,00:04:26.474,Yi!
00:04:26.557,00:04:27.934,I'm leaving for work.
00:04:28.434,00:04:29.269,Yi?
00:04:36.693,00:04:39.153,Eh. What are you supposed to be?
00:04:41.739,00:04:42.991,Where are you going?
00:04:43.074,00:04:46.786,-I've got stuff to do. -Stuff? What is this stuff?
00:04:46.869,00:04:48.162,It's summer holiday.
00:04:48.246,00:04:50.415,"Either be busy, or be on holiday."
00:04:50.498,00:04:51.833,That is what I say.
00:04:51.916,00:04:53.293,-Be careful out there. -Of course.
00:04:53.376,00:04:54.544,Be back before dinner.
00:04:54.627,00:04:55.586,-I'll try. -Warm enough?
00:04:55.670,00:04:57.130,-Toasty. -No boys.
00:04:57.213,00:04:58.631,What? No... no boys.
00:04:58.715,00:04:59.674,Do you need any money?
00:04:59.757,00:05:02.552,"Mom, Nai Nai, I've got it covered."
00:05:06.639,00:05:08.224,Okay. Bye.
00:05:09.517,00:05:11.811,What on earth do you think she does all day?
00:05:14.731,00:05:15.732,-Heel. -Hey!
00:05:15.815,00:05:17.358,-Would you guys give me a break? -Hey!
00:05:22.447,00:05:24.198,"Oh, my babies!"
00:05:24.741,00:05:25.575,Money transfer?
00:05:25.658,00:05:27.535,Sorry. Cash only.
00:05:32.874,00:05:35.168,We'll be back in a few hours.
00:06:02.195,00:06:04.363,"So, Jin, are you going to Shuo's this weekend?"
00:06:04.447,00:06:06.783,"No, I'm heading to Beijing to check out my school."
00:06:06.866,00:06:09.368,"-I'm, uh, pre-med. -Nice."
00:06:09.452,00:06:11.496,"-Oh, med school? -That's so hot."
00:06:11.579,00:06:12.580,"I know, right?"
00:06:14.540,00:06:17.752,"Ugh, What's that... smell?"
00:06:20.296,00:06:22.340,She looks like she slept in a dumpster.
00:06:36.979,00:06:38.981,He breaks left. He breaks right.
00:06:39.065,00:06:40.399,He's going in for the dunk!
00:06:41.692,00:06:42.985,"Hey, Yi."
00:06:43.069,00:06:45.363,Come shoot hoops with me. Come on.
00:06:45.446,00:06:47.490,"Sorry, Peng. I don't have time."
00:06:47.573,00:06:49.242,Why don't you ask the other kids?
00:06:49.325,00:06:51.410,The other kids are too little.
00:06:51.494,00:06:53.996,And some of them are freakishly good.
00:06:54.705,00:06:57.291,"Come on, Yi. You never play with me anymore."
00:06:57.375,00:07:00.128,"Peng, I've been busy all day."
00:07:00.211,00:07:03.005,"-Hey, your cousin will play with you. -I'll pick you up tomorrow."
00:07:03.089,00:07:04.549,Light show starts at 8.00.
00:07:04.632,00:07:05.675,Buh-bye.
00:07:06.384,00:07:08.136,"As usual, he's got a date."
00:07:10.763,00:07:12.807,"Wait, wait. Yi, watch."
00:07:13.975,00:07:16.477,"Three, two, one."
00:07:16.561,00:07:17.603,Stop and check.
00:07:19.730,00:07:22.567,"Hey, Yi. You know I can smell you from all the way over here, right?"
00:07:22.650,00:07:23.818,Like you can talk.
00:07:23.901,00:07:27.113,"I'm sorry. Is there any aftershave left, or did you use the whole bottle?"
00:07:27.196,00:07:29.031,Why? You hoping to borrow some?
00:07:29.115,00:07:30.366,"Ooh, not sure it'll help."
00:07:31.492,00:07:34.370,You guys want to work out some of this tension on the court?
00:07:34.454,00:07:37.206,"Forget it, Peng. We wouldn't want to mess up Jin's hair."
00:07:37.290,00:07:38.374,And the new kicks.
00:07:38.458,00:07:40.293,No basketball for these babies.
00:07:42.295,00:07:44.213,That's what you always say.
00:07:44.297,00:07:46.924,Forty-eight likes. Sweet!
00:07:49.677,00:07:53.639,"Don't. I know what you're thinking, so just don't say it."
00:07:53.723,00:07:56.434,She's never at home anymore.
00:07:56.517,00:07:57.727,Ma.
00:07:57.810,00:07:59.228,That's all I'm gonna say.
00:07:59.312,00:08:01.731,Not another word.
00:08:03.441,00:08:04.275,"So, that's it?"
00:08:04.358,00:08:06.819,We're just going to give up on her?
00:08:06.903,00:08:09.155,I'd never give up on Yi.
00:08:09.238,00:08:12.617,"Look, we both know what she's been going through."
00:08:12.700,00:08:14.452,She misses her dad.
00:08:15.328,00:08:16.662,We all do.
00:08:16.746,00:08:19.665,"If we're patient and don't push her, then just maybe..."
00:08:21.959,00:08:24.170,We've been waiting for you to eat.
00:08:24.253,00:08:26.964,Oh. I... I ate on my way back. So I'm good.
00:08:27.048,00:08:30.635,"Either eat here or there, but never on the move."
00:08:30.718,00:08:32.720,That is what I say.
00:08:32.803,00:08:35.806,"Hey, Yi, why don't we all sit down together tonight."
00:08:35.890,00:08:36.724,As a family?
00:08:38.976,00:08:40.353,You need to eat.
00:08:40.436,00:08:43.147,You don't want to be so short like your mother.
00:08:43.231,00:08:46.150,"-Oh, I'm... okay. Thank you, Nai Nai. -Yi, wait."
00:08:46.234,00:08:49.362,What would you say to playing a little violin for us after supper?
00:08:49.445,00:08:51.906,-Remember when you used to... -I... I can't.
00:08:53.950,00:08:55.910,Because I...
00:08:56.661,00:08:58.079,I... I sold it.
00:09:00.748,00:09:01.958,I'm sorry.
00:10:09.775,00:10:10.901,Someday.
00:11:25.976,00:11:26.977,No.
00:12:23.784,00:12:25.286,"No. No, no..."
00:12:41.552,00:12:42.845,Huh?
00:13:04.867,00:13:06.785,Hold up. Spotted something at two o'clock.
00:13:10.456,00:13:11.457,There's nothing there.
00:13:11.540,00:13:12.666,Moving on.
00:14:17.856,00:14:18.857,Oh.
00:14:30.244,00:14:31.620,"Hi, Mom. Bye, Nai Nai."
00:14:34.290,00:14:36.208,-Excuse me. -Whoa.
00:14:41.839,00:14:43.465,Bam! It came out of nowhere.
00:14:43.549,00:14:44.717,Then it was gone.
00:14:48.012,00:14:49.179,Did you see where it went?
00:14:49.263,00:14:51.515,"Lady, I just told you. It was gone."
00:14:52.224,00:14:54.143,What... what was it anyway?
00:14:54.226,00:14:57.062,"Um, let me take care of the repairs to your truck."
00:15:01.233,00:15:03.652,A little compensation for your silence.
00:15:03.736,00:15:04.570,It's a bribe.
00:15:29.386,00:15:30.220,Oh.
00:15:30.304,00:15:32.514,"-So you're hungry now, hm? -Oh, yeah."
00:15:34.266,00:15:36.769,Let them cool. You'll burn your mouth.
00:15:36.852,00:15:38.312,I keep telling your mother.
00:15:38.395,00:15:40.481,-You need to slow down. -Ow. Ow!
00:15:40.564,00:15:41.982,Spend more time here.
00:15:43.609,00:15:45.945,-Ow. -Mrs. Lui called me today.
00:15:46.028,00:15:48.364,Says you're fixing her computer.
00:15:48.447,00:15:54.036,And Mrs. Yuan in 4-B says you're going to trim her poodle's toenails.
00:15:54.119,00:15:56.121,I like that you're ambitious.
00:15:56.205,00:15:58.958,No one wants a lazy granddaughter.
00:15:59.041,00:16:01.251,"But busy, busy, busy."
00:16:01.335,00:16:03.671,What do you need to do all that for?
00:16:06.632,00:16:09.093,"Can we just talk about this later, Nai Nai?"
00:16:09.176,00:16:10.761,You don't have to worry.
00:16:30.155,00:16:31.240,"Hey, boy."
00:16:33.158,00:16:34.159,Or girl.
00:16:34.910,00:16:36.662,Are you hungry?
00:16:46.296,00:16:48.841,"Whoo. Yeah, you're definitely a boy."
00:18:03.749,00:18:06.585,"I don't know where you came from, but you..."
00:18:13.342,00:18:15.511,"You stay in here, okay? There..."
00:18:15.594,00:18:17.471,There are people looking for you.
00:18:20.557,00:18:21.767,Hmm.
00:19:06.520,00:19:08.272,"No, no, no... Okay, okay."
00:19:15.737,00:19:16.655,Wait.
00:19:23.996,00:19:27.040,My dad used to play for me. It always made me feel better.
00:20:11.168,00:20:12.669,"All better, right?"
00:20:24.598,00:20:26.600,Uh... The...
00:20:27.643,00:20:28.685,Huh?
00:20:32.439,00:20:33.941,"Good night, sleepyhead."
00:20:34.650,00:20:35.651,Hmm?
00:20:47.871,00:20:48.705,Wait.
00:20:49.248,00:20:50.958,Do you know that place?
00:20:55.462,00:20:57.839,Is that... is that your home?
00:20:59.758,00:21:01.969,"You know, home."
00:21:10.852,00:21:11.853,No way.
00:21:16.275,00:21:18.944,Creature from Mount Everest.
00:21:19.027,00:21:25.534,"Considered to be no more than fairy tale and myth, enthusiasts still hold out hope that these creatures actually do exist."
00:21:37.296,00:21:39.715,for that abominable creature's escape.
00:21:39.798,00:21:48.181,"Now, you will get every car we have out there, or I will send you back to your job at the shopping mall."
00:21:48.265,00:21:50.058,"Uh, yes, sir. Understood."
00:21:50.142,00:21:51.310,"Attention, all units."
00:21:51.393,00:21:53.103,We need every car out on the street.
00:22:53.288,00:22:54.414,Hm?
00:22:54.498,00:22:58.710,"I was dribbling, and the guy was like, Oh, no, and I was like, Oh, yeah."
00:22:58.794,00:22:59.753,Want to play a game?
00:23:01.588,00:23:04.007,"Hey, Nai Nai, want to shoot some hoops?"
00:23:04.091,00:23:06.051,You know I only play for money.
00:23:07.803,00:23:10.055,"Uh, something's missing."
00:23:11.389,00:23:12.724,What in the...
00:23:12.808,00:23:17.312,"Peng, go get your cousin Jin, and see who stole my air conditioner."
00:23:17.395,00:23:19.106,"Go! Go, go, go..."
00:23:21.233,00:23:23.944,Hey! What are you doing out here?
00:23:25.779,00:23:27.989,"Where did you get that? No, no, no..."
00:23:28.740,00:23:30.575,Give it back now!
00:23:32.577,00:23:34.329,Let go!
00:23:34.412,00:23:36.957,"Peng, that does not make sense. Why would they take it to the roof?"
00:23:40.418,00:23:42.546,"-Guys, what are you doing up here? -Hey."
00:23:42.629,00:23:44.214,-Get away from her! Okay. -No... Wait.
00:23:44.297,00:23:46.216,I'm calling the police. Hello?
00:23:46.299,00:23:47.759,"-No. Jin, don't. -Oh, yes."
00:23:47.843,00:23:49.845,"-There's a wild beast on our roof. -Hang up, Jin."
00:23:49.928,00:23:51.179,"-No... Stop, Jin. -Yes."
00:23:52.180,00:23:54.599,"-Turn up that scanner. -Yeah, yeah. On Heping Road."
00:23:55.976,00:23:57.853,That's the yeti! Ring Mr. Burnish.
00:23:57.936,00:24:00.605,"Jin, what have you done? He's not dangerous."
00:24:03.275,00:24:05.402,Look at him. He's a yeti!
00:24:05.485,00:24:06.820,-Cool. -What?
00:24:06.903,00:24:09.114,"No, yetis don't exist!"
00:24:11.366,00:24:12.200,They're back.
00:24:14.536,00:24:15.537,You have to go.
00:24:22.627,00:24:24.004,"Wait, wait. No, no, no..."
00:24:35.724,00:24:36.558,Wait!
00:24:40.187,00:24:41.771,He stole Yi!
00:24:45.192,00:24:46.026,"Come on, Peng."
00:24:52.616,00:24:53.700,Yi!
00:24:56.077,00:24:58.038,"Oh, we're never gonna catch up to them."
00:25:00.457,00:25:01.791,"Hey, girls."
00:25:01.875,00:25:03.001,Whoo!
00:25:03.084,00:25:05.253,How many girlfriends do you have?
00:25:11.927,00:25:13.511,Whoa!
00:25:28.860,00:25:31.655,"Dude, you darted Dave."
00:25:31.738,00:25:34.157,"Uh... Yeah, we lost them."
00:25:36.743,00:25:38.828,It cannot leave the city.
00:25:43.208,00:25:44.209,Watch out!
00:25:44.292,00:25:45.543,"Hold on, Peng."
00:25:45.627,00:25:47.087,There! There they are.
00:26:01.434,00:26:02.394,Whoo.
00:26:05.272,00:26:07.315,Down there. That boat's leaving the city.
00:26:07.399,00:26:08.441,You have to get on it.
00:26:20.829,00:26:22.205,Get into position.
00:26:25.542,00:26:27.585,"-Oh, there she is! -Oh, my gosh!"
00:26:29.045,00:26:30.171,What?
00:26:32.215,00:26:34.009,"Oh, no. How is she gonna get away?"
00:26:36.678,00:26:39.139,"-Wait, wait. What time is it? -Eight o'clock. Why?"
00:26:51.860,00:26:53.153,"Come on, Yi."
00:26:59.534,00:27:01.161,Where are they?
00:27:01.244,00:27:02.329,They're gone.
00:27:02.412,00:27:04.622,Copy that. They're gone.
00:27:04.706,00:27:05.832,And I'm dead.
00:27:08.501,00:27:10.670,Come on! Keep searching!
00:27:12.047,00:27:13.506,Oh.
00:27:13.590,00:27:15.675,"There they are. Come on, Peng."
00:27:17.469,00:27:19.512,Over there. That one.
00:27:29.022,00:27:31.107,"When that boat lands, don't stop."
00:27:31.191,00:27:32.776,Don't stop until you reach your mountain.
00:27:32.859,00:27:34.319,Don't stop until you're home.
00:27:44.954,00:27:46.164,Hide.
00:27:54.381,00:27:55.298,Oh.
00:27:56.800,00:27:58.385,"Yi, are you okay?"
00:28:00.637,00:28:01.888,"Oh, no."
00:28:02.806,00:28:03.640,"Oh, no, no."
00:28:03.723,00:28:05.850,"No, Yi. Don't you dare."
00:28:24.536,00:28:26.329,"I guess I'm coming with you, huh?"
00:28:26.955,00:28:27.789,Everest?
00:28:30.667,00:28:32.710,"Yi, are you crazy?"
00:28:32.794,00:28:35.463,-Wait for me! -Peng? Peng! No!
00:28:42.595,00:28:45.807,Peng! I'm responsible for you.
00:28:46.850,00:28:48.893,Ugh. Your mom's gonna kill me.
00:28:51.980,00:28:53.398,My babies.
00:28:54.065,00:28:57.068,"No, no, no. You think this is funny?"
00:28:57.152,00:29:06.077,"Do you even know how much What were you thinking, Yi?"
00:29:06.161,00:29:08.788,You have gotten me into so much trouble.
00:29:08.872,00:29:11.458,I am so mad at you right now. You know what?
00:29:11.541,00:29:13.668,I can't even talk to you right now! That's how mad I am!
00:29:33.354,00:29:34.522,"one week, Captain."
00:29:34.606,00:29:40.987,"Now, how am I supposed to prove the yeti exists when I don't have..."
00:29:41.070,00:29:42.530,a yeti?
00:29:42.614,00:29:44.532,-Uh... -No speaking!
00:29:48.495,00:29:50.580,"Dr. Zara, what am I going to do?"
00:29:50.663,00:29:53.458,The science community will be there. The press will be there.
00:29:53.541,00:29:58.171,"The world will be there, watching with their eyes."
00:29:58.254,00:30:02.801,"Mr. Burnish, there are many rare and exotic animals you have collected over the years."
00:30:02.884,00:30:04.469,"These snakes, for example."
00:30:04.552,00:30:08.765,You're the only one in the world to have a newly born clutch of rare whooping snakes.
00:30:10.266,00:30:12.477,Down!
00:30:12.560,00:30:15.980,"Go in your hole, you weird snakes."
00:30:16.064,00:30:17.482,"Sir, please."
00:30:17.565,00:30:20.026,These creatures are to be respected.
00:30:22.111,00:30:23.446,Hmm...
00:30:23.530,00:30:24.823,They would make a lovely belt.
00:30:24.906,00:30:27.408,"Mr. Burnish, they are one of a kind."
00:30:27.492,00:30:28.993,A one-of-a-kind whooping belt.
00:30:29.077,00:30:30.912,A belt that goes whoop. Do I want that?
00:30:30.995,00:30:32.038,I don't know.
00:30:33.164,00:30:34.916,Take them away.
00:30:36.626,00:30:38.795,"Wait, how many snakes are there supposed to be?"
00:30:42.799,00:30:46.594,"We promised the public a yeti, and nothing else will do."
00:30:46.678,00:30:47.804,Nothing!
00:30:47.887,00:30:51.307,I don't care if the yeti is dead or alive.
00:30:51.391,00:30:52.851,I just need him!
00:30:54.602,00:30:55.812,Your gerbil is freaking me out.
00:30:55.895,00:30:59.649,Jerboa. Duchess is an albino jerboa.
00:30:59.732,00:31:01.734,"And she, too, is one of a kind."
00:31:01.818,00:31:09.617,"Sir, as a zoologist, it is my mission in life to make sure that all animals are protected, especially the rare and exotic ones."
00:31:09.701,00:31:12.662,That is the only reason I agreed to find your yeti.
00:31:12.745,00:31:14.205,And you did.
00:31:14.289,00:31:22.714,"For a few short days, we had one, but I cannot go to that unveiling empty-handed."
00:31:24.048,00:31:26.426,I will not be made into a laughingstock again.
00:31:26.509,00:31:28.052,"Not, not, not..."
00:31:28.678,00:31:30.638,"Oh, there's news, Mr. Burnish."
00:31:30.722,00:31:31.681,News about you leaving?
00:31:31.764,00:31:35.560,A dockworker saw a creature and some kids boarding a cargo barge last night.
00:31:35.643,00:31:38.688,"Dr. Zara, you are the best in your field."
00:31:38.771,00:31:41.149,"Please, help me get him back."
00:31:41.232,00:31:42.734,Under one condition.
00:31:42.817,00:31:44.986,We bring the yeti back alive.
00:31:45.069,00:31:46.613,You have to promise me.
00:31:46.696,00:31:48.990,He will not be harmed.
00:31:49.073,00:31:50.700,"Fine! Fine, fine, fine..."
00:31:50.783,00:31:53.202,"Captain, where did that boat land?"
00:31:53.286,00:31:54.370,Ah...
00:31:55.246,00:31:56.372,"Yeah, Ma."
00:31:56.456,00:31:57.874,Beijing is...
00:31:57.957,00:31:59.709,Great. And the dorms...
00:31:59.792,00:32:00.877,The dorms are clean.
00:32:02.170,00:32:03.254,Peng? Oh!
00:32:03.338,00:32:04.964,"-Peng is, uh... -Look at all those teeth."
00:32:05.840,00:32:06.674,Peng's fine.
00:32:06.758,00:32:08.718,"-Hey, hey. -Oh."
00:32:08.801,00:32:10.303,"And Yi came, too."
00:32:10.386,00:32:13.389,"Yeah. Mm-hm. She's, uh, she's checking out the university."
00:32:14.307,00:32:16.768,"Soda? Oh, yeah!"
00:32:19.896,00:32:20.813,Catch!
00:32:27.820,00:32:28.988,"Hey, Everest."
00:32:29.072,00:32:29.989,Come over here.
00:32:30.073,00:32:31.574,How long will we be here?
00:32:33.743,00:32:35.036,Excuse me.
00:32:35.119,00:32:36.829,Cafeteria food is a little rich.
00:32:36.913,00:32:38.581,"Well, I got to go, Ma. Bye."
00:32:39.123,00:32:42.293,I cannot believe that you made me lie to my mother.
00:32:42.377,00:32:44.837,I love this stuff!
00:32:45.588,00:32:47.215,"Hey, okay. Everest, look."
00:32:47.966,00:32:51.511,"First, you go over the Yellow Mountain."
00:32:52.303,00:32:54.263,Then to the Yangtze River.
00:32:54.347,00:32:57.809,And that river will take you most of the way to the Himalayas.
00:32:57.892,00:33:00.728,And finally... to Mount Everest!
00:33:00.812,00:33:02.730,This is how you're going to get home.
00:33:04.232,00:33:05.483,Mount Everest? No...
00:33:05.566,00:33:07.235,That has to be hundreds of miles away.
00:33:10.530,00:33:12.532,I just hope he can make it all that way.
00:33:16.536,00:33:17.537,"He, um..."
00:33:17.620,00:33:19.038,He seems capable.
00:33:25.253,00:33:27.005,"-Hello! -Peng, get down!"
00:33:30.508,00:33:31.801,"Yeah, we should hide."
00:33:45.148,00:33:45.982,Wait.
00:33:47.150,00:33:48.359,Why are we still moving?
00:33:50.111,00:33:52.488,'Cause we're not at the dock anymore.
00:33:54.449,00:33:55.533,No!
00:34:05.918,00:34:06.961,Wow.
00:34:07.045,00:34:09.756,I can't believe how beautiful it is out here.
00:34:09.839,00:34:12.341,I can't believe I haven't eaten in 24 hours.
00:34:12.425,00:34:13.634,I'm starving.
00:34:16.137,00:34:17.096,Uh-oh.
00:34:17.180,00:34:19.348,"Guys, I got to go."
00:34:19.432,00:34:20.933,Just hold it.
00:34:24.395,00:34:25.438,He's got to go.
00:34:30.777,00:34:32.111,Out of my way!
00:34:36.991,00:34:38.409,-I'm good. -Okay.
00:34:39.035,00:34:40.703,"Come on, come on, come on..."
00:34:42.371,00:34:43.372,"Okay, that's good enough."
00:34:43.456,00:34:44.499,Good enough for what?
00:34:44.582,00:34:46.334,To buy tickets home.
00:34:46.417,00:34:51.672,"Okay, look, the next boat leaves around 5:00, so let's hope that's enough time to find our way back to the dock."
00:34:53.674,00:34:55.843,"Yes, waiter. I'm ready to order."
00:34:55.927,00:34:58.262,I'll have some of Nai Nai's pork buns.
00:34:58.346,00:35:00.306,"-With extra pork! -All right. Get up, Peng."
00:35:00.389,00:35:02.600,-We got to go. -And a side of pork.
00:35:16.405,00:35:18.199,-Jin. -Is he humming?
00:35:21.786,00:35:23.162,What's going on?
00:35:23.246,00:35:24.080,Whoa.
00:35:29.168,00:35:30.419,What is happening?
00:35:31.629,00:35:33.965,Is that a...
00:35:34.048,00:35:35.466,A blueberry?
00:35:41.764,00:35:42.682,Food!
00:35:47.478,00:35:49.105,"Guys, these are delicious."
00:35:49.188,00:35:50.314,That doesn't make any sense.
00:35:55.069,00:35:57.738,"Not funny, all right? This is cashmere!"
00:35:57.822,00:35:59.365,Uh... Jin?
00:36:01.325,00:36:02.451,Now what?
00:36:03.161,00:36:03.995,Oh.
00:36:06.497,00:36:07.456,Do something.
00:36:10.626,00:36:11.669,Run!
00:36:15.923,00:36:16.924,Incoming!
00:36:34.901,00:36:36.944,Tell Nai Nai's pork buns I love them.
00:36:52.793,00:36:55.296,"Hey, Jin, did you get enough to eat?"
00:36:56.923,00:37:01.928,Let's just say I've got blueberries in places where blueberries should never be.
00:37:06.557,00:37:07.808,Okay.
00:37:08.309,00:37:10.561,Watch and learn.
00:37:20.154,00:37:21.822,Why are you stopping?
00:37:21.906,00:37:26.035,"Because, in about five minutes we won't be able to see our hands in front of our faces."
00:37:26.118,00:37:28.663,And that is exactly why we've got to keep moving.
00:37:28.746,00:37:29.664,All right?
00:37:29.747,00:37:31.832,"Come on, Peng. We need to get back to that dock."
00:37:34.168,00:37:36.629,-First thing in the morning. -Yes!
00:37:42.927,00:37:44.595,There's so many.
00:37:51.102,00:37:52.603,Lady... Not funny.
00:37:52.687,00:37:57.566,"Well, my mom told me that the stars are our ancestors who always watch over us."
00:37:59.402,00:38:00.861,My mom says that too.
00:38:08.077,00:38:10.037,Great. No reception.
00:38:10.121,00:38:12.123,I'm entirely cut off from my social life.
00:38:12.206,00:38:13.833,Hmm. How traumatic.
00:38:13.916,00:38:15.293,"Yeah, Yi, it is."
00:38:15.376,00:38:17.753,"Because, unlike you, I like having friends."
00:38:17.837,00:38:19.922,-I'm not some kind of a... -Loner?
00:38:20.006,00:38:22.466,Is that what you were gonna say?
00:38:22.550,00:38:26.387,"Well, for your info, I'm a self-proclaimed loner."
00:38:26.470,00:38:27.847,"-There's a difference, okay? -Fine."
00:38:27.930,00:38:30.766,"Because in the morning, Peng and I are headed back to the city."
00:38:31.726,00:38:33.060,I can't leave him.
00:38:33.144,00:38:36.147,-Yi. -You've seen what he can do. He's...
00:38:36.230,00:38:38.024,He's amazing.
00:38:38.107,00:38:40.359,He's... He's magical.
00:38:40.443,00:38:42.820,Oh. So now he's a magical yeti.
00:38:42.903,00:38:44.697,Do you realize how crazy you sound?
00:38:45.323,00:38:47.074,Look what happened with the blueberries.
00:38:47.158,00:38:49.577,That wasn't him! That was a natural phenomenon.
00:38:49.660,00:38:50.786,Just one...
00:38:50.870,00:38:52.330,that I can't explain yet.
00:38:52.413,00:38:54.415,"One, two, three, four."
00:38:54.498,00:38:56.834,I declare a thumb war. Go!
00:39:11.515,00:39:14.393,Will you two please just give it a rest?
00:39:14.477,00:39:15.353,"Oh, my gosh."
00:39:15.436,00:39:17.104,I'm beginning to sound like my parents.
00:39:19.190,00:39:21.025,That's why they get along so well.
00:39:21.108,00:39:23.444,Everest is just a kid.
00:39:23.527,00:39:27.114,"He's probably, like, the same age as Peng -but in yeti years. -Stop hitting yourself."
00:39:27.198,00:39:28.491,Stop hitting yourself.
00:39:28.574,00:39:31.869,Right. There's no way that giant thing is a kid.
00:39:31.952,00:39:33.662,Wait. I'll prove it to you.
00:39:33.746,00:39:35.456,"Everest, come over here."
00:39:39.710,00:39:42.338,This is you.
00:39:44.173,00:39:46.258,And your parents.
00:39:47.426,00:39:49.512,Aw. You have your mother's eyes.
00:39:53.808,00:39:54.975,I will make sure you get home.
00:39:56.227,00:39:58.354,Take him all the way back to Mount Everest?
00:39:58.437,00:39:59.772,Maybe I am.
00:39:59.855,00:40:01.899,"Jin, he needs to get back to his family."
00:40:01.982,00:40:04.693,"And what about your family? Don't they need you, too?"
00:40:07.071,00:40:08.489,"What's that all about, Yi?"
00:40:09.156,00:40:11.367,Don't talk to me about family.
00:40:11.450,00:40:13.119,You have no idea.
00:40:15.079,00:40:17.706,"Your life is so easy, Jin."
00:40:17.790,00:40:23.546,"Do you even... Do you even want to be a doctor, or do you just think that you'll... I don't know, you'll look good in white?"
00:40:23.629,00:40:26.006,All right. Call me shallow all you want.
00:40:33.431,00:40:35.224,I don't care if you think I'm crazy.
00:40:36.725,00:40:37.685,You're impossible.
00:41:02.668,00:41:04.128,Is that Yi?
00:41:15.723,00:41:16.849,Wait. Don't stop.
00:41:19.101,00:41:22.229,Your Nai Nai said you stopped playing -after your dad died. -Peng!
00:41:22.313,00:41:24.273,"It's okay, Jin. Really."
00:41:24.356,00:41:26.484,Was this your dad's violin?
00:41:26.567,00:41:27.485,Mm-hm.
00:41:27.985,00:41:30.446,"You know, I really liked your dad."
00:41:31.363,00:41:32.490,"Thanks, Peng."
00:41:34.742,00:41:37.828,"Well, we better head out if we're gonna make it to the Yangtze River."
00:41:37.912,00:41:39.580,-You're coming? -Yeah. I checked.
00:41:39.663,00:41:42.833,And Dahe Village has boats leaving for the city every hour.
00:41:44.335,00:41:47.546,"Okay, well, when we get there, you and Peng can take a boat back, but..."
00:41:58.766,00:42:03.979,"Well, that boat pulled in yesterday morning, but we've unloaded all of the cargo and didn't find anyone."
00:42:04.063,00:42:06.148,Would you mind if we search it again?
00:42:07.858,00:42:09.568,"-You got anything? -No, Captain."
00:42:10.486,00:42:12.696,-He was here? -Yes.
00:42:12.780,00:42:14.990,And it looks like he fancies soda.
00:42:25.584,00:42:27.294,Stop!
00:42:34.134,00:42:36.470,"Sorry, Doctor. There's no sign of them anywhere."
00:42:39.098,00:42:41.100,"-Sir, the yeti has disappeared. -It has been..."
00:42:41.183,00:42:44.770,so long since I've been out in nature.
00:42:44.853,00:42:46.897,"-Sir, if we... -Look at this tree."
00:42:47.481,00:42:48.691,It's a wonderful tree.
00:42:49.692,00:42:50.776,Look at the colors.
00:42:51.277,00:42:52.653,I love this tree.
00:42:52.736,00:42:54.780,"You there. Chop it down and put it in a bag, will you?"
00:42:54.863,00:42:57.032,"-Right away, sir. -I want it in my penthouse..."
00:42:59.410,00:43:01.996,-Mr. Burnish. -Right. What? What is it?
00:43:02.079,00:43:06.125,We should divide the team Captain!
00:43:06.208,00:43:07.626,Let us fan out.
00:43:08.210,00:43:09.169,"Yes, sir."
00:43:12.256,00:43:15.342,"Now, on the map, that village is only, like, a centimeter away."
00:43:15.426,00:43:16.719,That can't be that far.
00:43:16.802,00:43:18.512,It must just be on the other side of the...
00:43:19.013,00:43:20.306,Whoa.
00:43:20.389,00:43:21.807,...the Yellow Mountain.
00:43:26.520,00:43:28.272,-Whoa. -Wait. Wait.
00:43:28.355,00:43:30.566,We are not going over that.
00:43:30.649,00:43:32.735,"Come on, Everest. I'll race you."
00:43:45.789,00:43:47.916,"Everest, look. Make a wish."
00:43:55.215,00:44:04.016,"Okay. I mean, I wish I was a basketball superstar."
00:44:07.519,00:44:12.024,"Starting in the championship game, the mighty Peng!"
00:44:16.195,00:44:18.947,"Wait, is that a drone? Cool!"
00:44:21.950,00:44:22.868,Okay.
00:44:22.951,00:44:24.745,Not so cool. Not so cool.
00:44:25.454,00:44:27.831,"Oh, no. It's those guys from the city."
00:44:27.915,00:44:29.625,I told you this was a crazy idea.
00:44:30.167,00:44:31.960,"Captain, I have footage."
00:44:32.044,00:44:33.379,Copy that.
00:44:33.462,00:44:37.257,Those little thieves stole my yeti.
00:44:37.341,00:44:38.884,-Get us there. -Keep your eyes on 'em.
00:44:40.844,00:44:41.762,What now?
00:44:41.845,00:44:43.555,I wish there was a way out of here.
00:44:47.434,00:44:49.728,Uh... What's going on?
00:44:49.812,00:44:51.146,Whoa.
00:44:51.230,00:44:53.399,"Yi, let go of that. It's dangerous."
00:44:53.482,00:44:55.734,"Everest, are you sure about this?"
00:44:55.818,00:44:58.487,No! Peng! Get down from there right now!
00:44:58.570,00:44:59.446,"Hey, Peng!"
00:45:07.996,00:45:09.373,Meet me at that village.
00:45:33.439,00:45:34.773,"Everyone, push!"
00:45:43.490,00:45:45.451,-Whoa! -Oh!
00:45:48.620,00:45:50.289,-Are you catching this? -Is that a giant...
00:45:51.039,00:45:52.082,dandelion?
00:45:52.166,00:45:53.792,Giant dandelions?
00:45:53.876,00:45:56.795,"Look, stop messing about and get my yeti!"
00:45:56.879,00:45:58.839,"Uh, yes, sir. Let's take 'em down."
00:46:11.894,00:46:14.104,"Yeah! Take that, drones."
00:46:19.276,00:46:22.237,"So, who's going to tell Mr. Burnish?"
00:46:22.321,00:46:23.322,-Not it! -Not it!
00:46:24.615,00:46:26.658,"Wait, where are we going?"
00:46:34.458,00:46:36.460,-I'm Dr. Zara. -I know who you are.
00:46:36.543,00:46:38.337,-You do? -Yeah.
00:46:41.965,00:46:43.550,Your gerbil is freaking me out.
00:46:43.634,00:46:46.637,A boy that knows his gerbils. I like him.
00:46:46.720,00:46:49.264,"Bad? Listen, you've got this all wrong."
00:46:49.348,00:46:53.727,"That wild beast is unpredictable, even dangerous."
00:46:53.810,00:46:57.105,We were trying to rescue your friend when the yeti kidnapped her.
00:47:00.400,00:47:02.027,"Listen, you twit!"
00:47:02.110,00:47:04.446,I own that yeti. He is my yeti.
00:47:04.530,00:47:06.156,I want my yeti back!
00:47:06.240,00:47:08.408,Right? Just nod.
00:47:08.492,00:47:11.036,"-Mr. Burnish, please. -Ow!"
00:47:12.246,00:47:13.622,"All right, look."
00:47:13.705,00:47:18.418,I... I just need to find my cousin and my friend and get 'em back to the city in one piece.
00:47:18.502,00:47:25.592,"I can get all of you back to the city, but the only way I can help your friends is if I know where they are. Do you know?"
00:47:27.344,00:47:30.556,That yeti is the pinnacle of my research.
00:47:30.639,00:47:32.516,I really need him back.
00:47:34.101,00:47:38.814,"I don't know where they are, but I do know where they will be."
00:48:00.127,00:48:01.545,"No, over here."
00:48:05.507,00:48:07.301,"That was amazing, Everest."
00:48:08.010,00:48:09.886,"You saved us, and now we're..."
00:48:09.970,00:48:11.722,We're...
00:48:11.805,00:48:12.639,Where are we?
00:48:14.683,00:48:17.436,All I know is we're a long way from Jin.
00:48:17.519,00:48:19.730,"Yeah, well, that's his fault. He should have jumped."
00:48:19.813,00:48:22.441,"I mean, why... why doesn't he ever just jump?"
00:48:22.524,00:48:25.360,He did. He jumped on that boat back in the city.
00:48:25.444,00:48:27.946,That's what got him on this trip in the first place.
00:48:28.030,00:48:30.198,"Yeah, but that's because he was worried about you."
00:48:30.282,00:48:31.199,You're his family.
00:48:31.283,00:48:33.410,"Yi, he thinks of you as family, too."
00:48:33.493,00:48:34.536,Wh... What?
00:48:46.632,00:48:50.886,"Everest, Jin said Yi was like his little sister when they were kids."
00:48:51.595,00:48:57.100,"She was always doing something crazy that would get her into trouble, so he had to watch out for her."
00:48:58.560,00:49:00.145,And he still does.
00:49:02.481,00:49:05.108,I... I think we should get going.
00:49:06.735,00:49:08.987,But don't worry. I can get us out of here.
00:49:09.071,00:49:10.155,Let's go.
00:49:12.449,00:49:13.659,"Put 'em down, Everest."
00:49:35.972,00:49:38.934,A yeti. A real yeti.
00:49:39.518,00:49:42.521,Cold eyes staring.
00:49:42.604,00:49:44.398,It tried to kill me!
00:49:45.107,00:49:46.733,I needed to protect myself.
00:49:46.817,00:49:48.568,I swung my ice axe...
00:49:49.903,00:49:50.904,and it was gone.
00:49:51.571,00:49:52.656,No footprints.
00:49:53.615,00:49:54.825,Nothing.
00:49:54.908,00:49:58.412,"I rushed back to tell the world what had happened, but without proof..."
00:49:59.621,00:50:00.956,they laughed at me.
00:50:02.124,00:50:03.917,They laughed at me.
00:50:05.377,00:50:07.963,You spent all these years trying to get your proof?
00:50:08.505,00:50:09.798,Mm-hm.
00:50:11.466,00:50:19.474,"I'm so used to looking down on the world, it's amazing how small one feels just by looking up."
00:50:21.101,00:50:23.770,"Mr. Burnish, we need to get an early start."
00:50:23.854,00:50:26.481,"Thanks to Jin, we've learned the yeti's whereabouts."
00:50:27.107,00:50:28.942,"Yes, yes."
00:50:30.861,00:50:33.071,Duchess... is that your name?
00:50:33.155,00:50:37.576,"You're kind of cute, you know, in your own ugly, beady-eyed kind of way."
00:50:44.040,00:50:45.584,I can't feel my feet.
00:50:46.960,00:50:49.504,Don't worry. I'll get us out of here.
00:50:52.674,00:50:54.551,We are completely lost.
00:50:54.634,00:50:57.721,"Everest is nowhere near his mountain, and for all we know, Jin..."
00:50:57.804,00:50:59.931,"Jin could be in trouble right now, and it's..."
00:51:04.895,00:51:07.606,"Jin said this trip was a crazy idea, and..."
00:51:07.689,00:51:10.358,"I don't know, maybe... maybe he's right."
00:51:10.442,00:51:11.276,"I mean, but..."
00:51:13.987,00:51:16.865,Yeah. And the map on his cell phone.
00:51:19.701,00:51:22.204,"It's okay, Everest. It's just a koi fish."
00:51:22.287,00:51:23.288,That's weird.
00:51:23.371,00:51:25.332,Why are they swimming against the current?
00:51:25.415,00:51:27.250,They're actually trying to get back home.
00:51:28.960,00:51:29.795,Ooh...
00:51:34.007,00:51:35.342,"Yeah, let's just put him back."
00:51:35.842,00:51:36.885,Do you think he'll make it?
00:51:36.968,00:51:39.054,"Well, he's sure gonna try."
00:51:41.515,00:51:42.724,What?
00:51:44.684,00:51:46.770,It's... just something my mom told me.
00:51:46.853,00:51:50.106,It means that when things get really tough...
00:51:52.108,00:51:53.276,they never give up.
00:51:53.944,00:51:54.778,"You know what, guys?"
00:51:55.403,00:51:56.613,We have to keep going. Come on.
00:51:56.696,00:51:57.906,"Come on, you guys, let's go."
00:51:59.157,00:52:00.575,"Everest, put the fish down."
00:52:01.868,00:52:03.078,Into the water.
00:52:21.847,00:52:24.975,"Get back, you abominable creature."
00:52:25.058,00:52:26.184,Back!
00:52:35.193,00:52:36.945,That's great. Of course.
00:52:37.028,00:52:43.118,"He said in the sweetest little voice, You're cute in your own ugly, beady-eyed kind of way."
00:52:43.201,00:52:46.621,"Ugh! I tell you, he's going soft."
00:52:46.705,00:52:47.622,We need to act fast.
00:52:47.706,00:52:53.628,"If that kid is right and we find the yeti at the river tomorrow, use any means possible to take him down."
00:52:53.712,00:52:55.463,I thought we had to keep the yeti alive.
00:52:55.547,00:52:59.759,"The buyer won't pay us unless he's still breathing, but if he's a little banged up, who cares?"
00:53:00.260,00:53:03.638,They're just gonna chop him up into little pieces for their experiments anyway.
00:53:03.722,00:53:05.432,"Well, what do we do with the kids?"
00:53:05.932,00:53:09.436,"If you want your ten per cent, you'll get rid of them for good!"
00:53:10.854,00:53:13.607,And get rid of this rodent I've been carrying around.
00:53:13.690,00:53:17.402,Do you know how hard it is to keep up this British animal-lover act?
00:53:17.485,00:53:18.486,I'm done!
00:53:18.570,00:53:21.865,Duchess? But she's a one-of-a-kind albino jerboa.
00:53:22.699,00:53:24.826,"She's just a rat, you idiot!"
00:53:34.252,00:53:35.378,Here.
00:53:35.462,00:53:37.130,I think you're better off with this guy.
00:53:41.092,00:53:42.177,Hmm... not now.
00:53:46.473,00:53:47.974,"All right, let's see."
00:53:48.058,00:53:49.643,SUV? Too loud.
00:53:51.937,00:53:53.271,Transporter? No.
00:53:59.194,00:54:00.111,Sweet.
00:54:02.822,00:54:04.115,Check the hair.
00:54:04.199,00:54:05.408,"Looking good, Jin."
00:54:05.492,00:54:06.534,"Thanks, Jin."
00:54:07.744,00:54:09.245,"All right, let's do this."
00:54:34.187,00:54:36.606,"It's okay, babies. It's okay. I got you."
00:55:04.592,00:55:06.594,"Nope, nope. I can't do it."
00:55:08.096,00:55:09.264,"All right, fine, just take it!"
00:55:17.564,00:55:18.648,Be the koi fish.
00:55:19.524,00:55:20.525,"That's it, Peng."
00:55:21.776,00:55:23.153,You keep swimming.
00:55:26.156,00:55:27.157,Come on!
00:55:32.537,00:55:34.456,"Yeah, but how are we gonna catch it?"
00:55:44.883,00:55:45.759,Whoa!
00:55:54.976,00:55:57.353,"Now, this is the way to travel."
00:55:57.437,00:55:59.189,"-Whoo-hoo! -Ready, Everest?"
00:56:06.404,00:56:08.114,I can't figure you out.
00:56:08.198,00:56:11.242,"I mean, how... how do you do that?"
00:56:12.869,00:56:17.624,"Maybe it's his gift, like when you play the violin or when I play basketball."
00:56:20.293,00:56:22.670,Now that... that is a gift.
00:56:45.485,00:56:48.279,"-Well, this is the village. -Do you see Jin?"
00:56:48.363,00:56:50.406,Through that mob? Are you kidding me?
00:56:50.490,00:56:52.617,-We need to both look for him. -What about Everest?
00:56:53.243,00:56:54.577,"Move it, yaks!"
00:56:54.661,00:56:55.829,Got an idea.
00:56:56.412,00:56:57.580,Grab all of that rope.
00:57:07.757,00:57:08.842,Can you see anything?
00:57:08.925,00:57:09.968,Nope.
00:57:13.471,00:57:15.431,Jin! Jin!
00:57:16.099,00:57:17.600,-We're gonna lose him. -I'll run ahead.
00:57:17.684,00:57:19.310,Stay there and blend in.
00:57:21.229,00:57:23.481,Oh! Your yak is odd-looking.
00:57:23.565,00:57:25.567,"Hey, don't body-shame my yak."
00:57:26.734,00:57:27.986,Jin! Jin!
00:57:29.195,00:57:30.029,Yes?
00:57:30.113,00:57:32.198,Whoa! I am so sorry.
00:57:36.578,00:57:38.955,Keep looking. He said they would be here.
00:57:39.038,00:57:40.957,I can't believe he crashed my bike.
00:57:51.342,00:57:53.303,"Go, Everest, go! Move it!"
00:57:53.386,00:57:54.637,"No. Oh, no."
00:57:54.721,00:57:55.555,"Hey, you!"
00:57:56.055,00:57:56.931,Need a ride?
00:57:59.767,00:58:01.895,-You showed up! -Of course I did.
00:58:02.479,00:58:04.063,Wait. Where's Peng?
00:58:06.399,00:58:07.233,Everest!
00:58:09.527,00:58:10.361,"Oh, no."
00:58:11.029,00:58:16.993,"Coming in at four-foot-ten and ready to take the game, the mighty Peng!"
00:58:27.212,00:58:28.129,Huh!
00:58:28.213,00:58:29.130,Whoo!
00:58:31.799,00:58:33.885,"Jin, I knew you'd be here."
00:58:34.469,00:58:36.137,"Good to see you, cuz."
00:58:40.266,00:58:42.018,my babies are all grown-up.
00:58:46.773,00:58:48.733,"Captain, don't you dare let them get away!"
00:58:48.816,00:58:51.402,Hold on. This little lady has a few tricks up her sleeve.
00:59:06.084,00:59:07.377,I'm trying!
00:59:19.514,00:59:20.807,It's working.
00:59:20.890,00:59:22.517,"Oh, no. Guys..."
00:59:24.310,00:59:25.186,-Turn! -Turn!
00:59:47.625,00:59:48.960,"Peng, Peng... look."
00:59:49.043,00:59:49.877,It's okay.
00:59:50.461,00:59:51.421,Wow!
01:00:01.889,01:00:03.558,This is amazing!
01:00:03.641,01:00:04.726,-This is impossible. -Whoo!
01:00:05.810,01:00:06.936,"Come on, Everest."
01:00:07.020,01:00:08.730,Make it go bigger!
01:00:13.568,01:00:14.777,Higher!
01:00:16.362,01:00:17.614,"Okay. Okay, that's enough."
01:00:21.951,01:00:22.785,Slow down!
01:00:33.463,01:00:35.590,-Peng! -Where is he?
01:00:49.979,01:00:50.813,"Oh, no."
01:00:51.939,01:00:53.816,"Everest, no. Everest."
01:00:54.692,01:00:55.693,Hold it in.
01:01:02.575,01:01:03.576,"Hey, Jin."
01:01:03.660,01:01:05.828,You got a little something right here.
01:01:18.007,01:01:18.841,No.
01:01:20.677,01:01:21.552,"Oh, no."
01:01:22.303,01:01:23.471,No.
01:01:23.554,01:01:25.348,No... No...
01:01:29.310,01:01:30.144,Yi?
01:01:50.915,01:01:51.916,You okay?
01:01:55.545,01:01:56.671,"Yeah, um..."
01:01:57.839,01:02:02.677,That violin meant everything to me.
01:02:05.972,01:02:09.934,"When we were little, you know my dad used to play all the time."
01:02:12.645,01:02:19.152,"But every night, when he was tucking me in, he would play this one song... just for me."
01:02:20.153,01:02:20.987,And...
01:02:21.946,01:02:25.116,"I don't know, it... made me feel like everything..."
01:02:26.033,01:02:27.243,was gonna be okay.
01:02:30.621,01:02:31.873,"Yi, I'm sorry."
01:02:33.458,01:02:35.084,I'm sorry for what I said.
01:02:35.626,01:02:37.295,"Too busy, never home. I..."
01:02:39.505,01:02:41.883,I know I keep busy.
01:02:42.592,01:02:44.135,I just... I don't know why.
01:02:44.677,01:02:46.304,"I mean, I..."
01:02:47.805,01:02:52.059,"I miss him, and I don't want to miss him, but..."
01:02:52.143,01:02:54.353,"I haven't even cried yet, Jin."
01:02:55.146,01:02:58.816,"And my family, we're all so distant, and I..."
01:03:01.319,01:03:03.654,I... don't know what to do.
01:03:04.906,01:03:07.742,"Well, are you sure they're the ones who are distant?"
01:03:11.120,01:03:14.791,"But you were right about me, too."
01:03:15.416,01:03:21.923,"Yeah, hate to admit it, but, I mean, that thought about looking good in the white doctor's coat, it did cross my mind."
01:03:22.548,01:03:24.842,"I am a horrible, horrible person."
01:03:27.512,01:03:29.138,"Yeah, you are the worst."
01:03:29.222,01:03:30.556,I really... I am.
01:03:33.476,01:03:34.393,"Yi, listen."
01:03:34.894,01:03:38.231,"If those people find Everest, we're all in danger."
01:03:38.815,01:03:41.067,"Wait, do... do they know where I'm taking him?"
01:03:45.238,01:03:49.742,And the yeti's powers will grow even stronger the closer he gets to those mountains.
01:03:49.826,01:03:53.079,But there's still one more chance to capture your yeti.
01:03:53.162,01:03:55.581,"At the foothills of those mountains, there's a bridge."
01:03:56.207,01:04:00.169,"Once the yeti crosses it, he'll blend in, disappear."
01:04:00.253,01:04:02.129,We will never find him again.
01:04:02.213,01:04:04.674,I've never seen powers like those before.
01:04:04.757,01:04:06.801,It's... intimidating.
01:04:07.301,01:04:08.594,"Stay the course, sir."
01:04:08.678,01:04:13.391,"After this, no one will ever laugh at you again."
01:04:14.225,01:04:15.309,You're right.
01:04:15.393,01:04:18.563,"Captain, we are going to need reinforcements."
01:04:18.646,01:04:21.691,Lots... of reinforcements.
01:04:21.774,01:04:22.608,"Yes, sir."
01:04:23.609,01:04:25.236,What do those powers mean for us?
01:04:26.028,01:04:28.030,That yeti's price tag just doubled.
01:04:29.115,01:04:30.741,"Hey, you guys, did you find that thing?"
01:04:30.825,01:04:32.034,We're working on it.
01:04:32.827,01:04:35.288,-There it is. -There it is.
01:04:35.371,01:04:36.998,There it is.
01:04:44.505,01:04:46.257,Come on. Come quickly.
01:04:46.340,01:04:47.258,Everest?
01:04:50.511,01:04:51.512,You okay?
01:04:58.561,01:05:00.980,-Is that... -Yeti hair? Yup.
01:05:09.864,01:05:11.407,See? It's as good as new.
01:05:13.618,01:05:14.452,No.
01:05:15.369,01:05:16.579,It's better than new.
01:05:25.546,01:05:27.924,Hey. When did you buy these?
01:05:28.007,01:05:29.717,"Oh, I... I didn't buy them."
01:05:30.635,01:05:32.386,They were my dad's.
01:05:32.970,01:05:36.307,He kept postcards of all the places he wanted to take us someday.
01:05:36.390,01:05:38.309,The... The whole family.
01:05:38.392,01:05:41.020,"Yi, they're all of the places we've been."
01:05:45.107,01:05:46.275,What?
01:05:48.069,01:05:49.946,No way. What... How...
01:05:50.029,01:05:51.197,How is this possible?
01:05:51.822,01:05:53.032,That can't be.
01:05:53.532,01:05:55.618,We've been to all of these.
01:05:56.410,01:05:57.662,All but one.
01:06:09.632,01:06:12.301,This is the place that my dad wanted me to see the most.
01:06:13.886,01:06:16.806,This... This is incredible.
01:06:17.932,01:06:19.850,"You brought me here, didn't you?"
01:06:21.519,01:06:22.937,Whoa.
01:06:24.981,01:06:26.273,Impossible.
01:06:52.550,01:06:53.676,Whoa.
01:07:08.107,01:07:09.108,Wow.
01:07:12.153,01:07:13.863,I wish Dad were here to see this.
01:07:19.285,01:07:20.327,Hmm...
01:09:17.361,01:09:18.654,"Thank you, Everest."
01:09:27.663,01:09:28.664,I did that?
01:09:32.918,01:09:33.919,Whoa.
01:09:38.424,01:09:39.425,Yi.
01:09:42.469,01:09:45.472,We are so going to the Himalayas.
01:09:55.274,01:09:56.483,"Come on, you guys."
01:09:56.567,01:09:58.319,"-Whoa! -Okay, okay!"
01:10:57.336,01:11:00.547,"Come on. If we keep going, we'll get to the Himalayas by morning."
01:11:00.631,01:11:03.300,Those guys are not gonna stop until they get... Everest!
01:11:06.178,01:11:07.346,Maybe.
01:11:08.514,01:11:09.974,"We still have to keep going, though."
01:11:10.057,01:11:11.058,I know.
01:11:13.978,01:11:15.688,Will it be the same?
01:11:15.771,01:11:17.898,"You know, when Everest goes home?"
01:11:18.732,01:11:20.192,"With us, I mean."
01:11:20.276,01:11:22.695,"Like, will you guys still want to hang out?"
01:11:22.778,01:11:24.071,"Of course we will, Peng."
01:11:25.698,01:11:29.118,"You know, I'll sure miss seeing these stars."
01:11:29.201,01:11:32.913,"Yeah, but even though we can't see them, we'll still know they're there."
01:11:32.997,01:11:34.456,"So, that's kind of cool, isn't it?"
01:11:34.540,01:11:37.626,"Yes, Peng, that's very cool."
01:11:48.595,01:11:50.139,What if they exist?
01:11:51.015,01:11:52.016,"Oh, my gosh."
01:12:04.903,01:12:05.904,Awesome!
01:12:05.988,01:12:07.448,"Everest, look."
01:12:10.075,01:12:11.368,What are we waiting for?
01:12:11.452,01:12:12.661,Let's go. Let's go!
01:12:18.208,01:12:19.877,Everest! Wait up!
01:12:31.555,01:12:32.556,Go back!
01:12:36.977,01:12:38.395,"Go, go, go..."
01:12:50.074,01:12:52.493,"Go to your mountain now, before it's too late."
01:12:54.495,01:12:56.038,"Captain, hurry."
01:12:56.121,01:12:58.540,Get my yeti! Get him now!
01:13:01.168,01:13:02.461,You're going the wrong way!
01:13:36.537,01:13:38.288,It's... amazing.
01:13:38.372,01:13:40.249,"Mr. Burnish, we're missing our chance."
01:13:43.293,01:13:45.212,Wait! Hold your fire!
01:13:56.181,01:13:57.141,Get back!
01:14:09.319,01:14:10.821,Take the shot!
01:14:14.158,01:14:16.160,He's... defending them.
01:14:16.827,01:14:17.661,Mr. Burnish.
01:14:18.912,01:14:19.913,Mr. Burnish!
01:14:22.040,01:14:24.418,"Doctor, I was wrong."
01:14:24.501,01:14:26.420,You were right.
01:14:26.503,01:14:33.302,"The yeti must be protected, and the best way to protect the yeti... is to let him go."
01:14:35.304,01:14:36.430,We must let him go.
01:14:37.848,01:14:40.225,"Captain, order your men to stow their weapons."
01:14:40.309,01:14:41.143,Do it now!
01:14:47.649,01:14:48.650,Hmm...
01:14:48.734,01:14:50.861,Quick! Mr. Burnish needs help.
01:14:56.074,01:14:57.451,Captain.
01:15:02.956,01:15:04.333,-Fire! -Fire! Fire!
01:15:15.719,01:15:16.970,Everest!
01:15:27.606,01:15:28.941,-No! -Get the kids! Go!
01:15:31.693,01:15:32.986,-Stop... -Everest!
01:15:46.625,01:15:47.960,I'll make sure the yeti's out.
01:15:52.089,01:15:54.341,You are never going to escape again.
01:15:56.385,01:15:57.636,Stop it!
01:16:15.070,01:16:17.531,-No! No... -Yi! No...
01:16:20.534,01:16:21.910,"-All right, move out. -Yes, sir."
01:18:39.631,01:18:41.049,-Let's go! -I'm out of here!
01:18:41.758,01:18:43.343,"Sir... Sir, wake up."
01:18:48.056,01:18:49.224,Everest!
01:18:54.146,01:18:56.815,Ahh! I thought we had to keep the yeti alive.
01:18:56.898,01:18:58.692,Dead will have to do.
01:19:00.777,01:19:01.987,No!
01:19:04.781,01:19:06.032,Yes!
01:19:18.712,01:19:20.172,No!
01:19:34.352,01:19:35.228,Everest?
01:19:44.070,01:19:45.071,Everest?
01:19:45.572,01:19:48.617,You are by far the most extraordinary creature I have ever seen.
01:19:49.910,01:19:51.828,That is exactly why the world...
01:19:52.829,01:19:55.081,must never know you exist.
01:19:56.958,01:19:58.502,They would not understand.
01:19:59.127,01:20:00.170,I didn't.
01:20:03.006,01:20:05.425,"Now, can I please help you get back to the city?"
01:20:05.509,01:20:06.885,"Thank you, but..."
01:20:07.761,01:20:09.429,I promised to take Everest home...
01:20:10.096,01:20:11.473,and he's not home yet.
01:20:12.057,01:20:14.434,You're going to take Everest all the way to Everest?
01:20:14.518,01:20:15.894,That is impossible.
01:20:15.977,01:20:21.900,"Sir, with all due respect, when Yi sets her mind on something, nothing is impossible."
01:20:21.983,01:20:23.235,Yes.
01:20:24.402,01:20:25.695,It's cold.
01:20:27.322,01:20:31.952,But there is something I have to insist that I give you.
01:20:32.035,01:20:33.245,-Thank you. -Thank you.
01:20:33.328,01:20:35.038,-See you later. -Don't worry.
01:20:35.664,01:20:37.332,I'll be waiting right here.
01:20:37.833,01:20:39.334,"They just wanted our coats, Dave."
01:20:41.545,01:20:45.215,"Guys, it sure is a long way up there."
01:20:46.800,01:20:47.843,Everest?
01:21:01.898,01:21:03.483,-Cool! -All right.
01:21:04.442,01:21:05.360,Bring it!
01:22:00.749,01:22:03.418,"Everest, it's your mountain."
01:22:16.681,01:22:17.891,What do we do now?
01:22:38.870,01:22:39.996,Whoa.
01:22:51.174,01:22:52.175,His parents.
01:22:52.258,01:22:53.385,Wow!
01:22:53.468,01:22:55.929,They'd be so good at basketball.
01:23:05.522,01:23:07.107,"We're finally home, Everest."
01:23:08.733,01:23:09.734,Home.
01:23:14.531,01:23:15.824,I can't...
01:23:16.616,01:23:17.993,I can't believe the journey's over.
01:23:42.642,01:23:43.768,It's not over.
01:23:47.147,01:23:48.356,"Thank you, Everest."
01:23:52.318,01:23:54.654,"I'll never forget you, Everest!"
01:25:20.323,01:25:23.118,-Ma? -Yi? You're back.
01:25:25.829,01:25:26.830,Oh.
01:25:29.249,01:25:30.250,Yi?
01:25:32.252,01:25:34.003,I missed you both so much.
01:25:34.087,01:25:38.591,"It's good to have you back, granddaughter."
01:25:43.304,01:25:44.848,It's probably the boys.
