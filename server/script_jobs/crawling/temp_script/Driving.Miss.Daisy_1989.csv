00:02:32.944,00:02:34.737,"Are you all right, Miss Daisy?"
00:02:47.876,00:02:48.793,Look at it.
00:02:56.301,00:02:57.385,That's good!
00:03:16.321,00:03:18.948,"-Have some iced tea, ma'am. -Thanks. Nice."
00:03:24.162,00:03:26.122,You two get back to work.
00:03:27.206,00:03:28.541,"-Yes, ma'am. -Yes, ma'am."
00:03:28.625,00:03:32.337,"It must have just come right off, went back in."
00:03:38.635,00:03:40.345,Sure. With our policy it'll work.
00:04:02.825,00:04:04.577,-Mama. -No.
00:04:06.204,00:04:08.039,-Mama. -No.
00:04:08.623,00:04:13.336,"You know, it's a miracle you're not laying at Emory Hospital or decked out at the funeral parlor."
00:04:15.380,00:04:17.632,Cucumbers are pretty this summer.
00:04:17.715,00:04:20.218,Look at you. You didn't even break your glasses.
00:04:20.301,00:04:22.303,It was the car's fault.
00:04:22.387,00:04:25.348,"-Mama, you had the car in the wrong gear. -I did not."
00:04:26.057,00:04:28.184,"Idella, you want a pickle with your lunch?"
00:04:28.268,00:04:29.435,Not me.
00:04:29.519,00:04:31.771,"Well, I'm putting up a jar for you to take home to William."
00:04:31.854,00:04:33.314,-You hear? -Yessum.
00:04:34.399,00:04:37.026,You backed the car right into the Pollack's yard.
00:04:37.110,00:04:38.945,You should have let me keep my LaSalle.
00:04:39.028,00:04:41.698,It never would have behaved this way and you know it.
00:04:41.781,00:04:45.368,"Mama, cars don't behave. They are behaved upon."
00:04:45.451,00:04:47.870,Fact is you demolished that Chrysler all by yourself.
00:04:47.954,00:04:50.081,Think what you want. I know the truth.
00:04:50.164,00:04:54.002,"The truth is you just cost the insurance company $2,700."
00:04:54.085,00:04:55.962,You're a terrible risk.
00:04:56.045,00:04:58.089,Nobody's gonna wanna issue you a policy after this.
00:04:58.172,00:05:00.258,You're just saying that to be hateful.
00:05:01.134,00:05:05.138,"Okay. Yes, I am. I'm making it all up."
00:05:05.221,00:05:06.848,Look out there on the driveway!
00:05:07.598,00:05:12.937,Every insurance company in America is out there waving their fountain pens trying to get you to sign up.
00:05:13.021,00:05:17.650,If you're gonna stand in my pantry and lie like a rug I think it's time for you to go somewhere else.
00:05:18.318,00:05:19.152,Okay.
00:05:20.653,00:05:22.405,I better get back to the office.
00:05:23.531,00:05:26.993,Florine will be having a fit if I don't get home on time tonight.
00:05:27.076,00:05:31.039,-You all must have plans tonight. -Going to the Ansleys for a dinner party.
00:05:31.122,00:05:33.624,"This is her idea of heaven on earth, isn't it?"
00:05:33.708,00:05:37.295,-What? -Socializing with Episcopalians.
00:05:41.841,00:05:43.301,"You're a doodle, Mama."
00:05:44.177,00:05:45.845,I'll stop by tomorrow evening.
00:05:45.928,00:05:47.680,How do you know I'll be here?
00:05:47.764,00:05:50.600,I'm certainly not dependent on you for company.
00:05:50.683,00:05:53.227,"Fine, I'll call first."
00:05:53.311,00:05:56.647,"But you know, we have got some real serious talking to do."
00:05:56.731,00:05:58.900,-No. -Mama.
00:05:58.983,00:06:37.355,"After the ball is over After the break of morn After the dancers' leaving After theâ€¦ Many a heart is aching Well, I need you now."
00:06:37.438,00:06:39.565,I have to be at the beauty shop in half an hour.
00:06:41.901,00:06:46.906,"No, I most certainly did not know you had to call a minimum of two hours ahead."
00:06:46.989,00:06:51.077,I don't know why you call yourself a taxicab company if you can't provide taxicabs.
00:06:52.120,00:06:55.748,Call your son down at the mill. He'd send somebody to carry you.
00:06:55.832,00:06:57.875,That won't be necessary.
00:06:57.959,00:07:00.920,I'll cancel the appointment and fix my own hair.
00:07:01.003,00:07:05.383,Sometimes I think you ain't got the sense God gave a lemon.
00:07:07.844,00:07:11.556,"-Two dots. I want that. -Oh, dear."
00:07:12.181,00:07:13.724,And a five bamboo.
00:07:13.808,00:07:17.019,"Well, this is not my day for mah-jongg. That's easy to see."
00:07:17.103,00:07:18.229,Nine bam.
00:07:18.312,00:07:20.815,I have to thank you all for coming here again.
00:07:20.898,00:07:24.694,"-I'm a real pariah without my car. -Oh, nonsense!"
00:07:24.777,00:07:26.946,-Three bam. -When are you getting a new one?
00:07:27.029,00:07:30.283,I don't know. Boolie's being real pokey about it.
00:07:30.366,00:07:32.869,"Don't worry, sugar. I'll come after you for temple tomorrow."
00:07:32.952,00:07:34.662,"Oh, that's sweet of you, honey."
00:07:38.749,00:07:40.960,"-Hey, Mama, you there? -Hey, Mother Werthan!"
00:07:41.043,00:07:42.336,It's just us!
00:07:42.420,00:07:45.339,-Why didn't you call? -We can't stay.
00:07:45.423,00:07:47.049,So I gather.
00:07:47.133,00:07:49.218,The Millers are giving a hay ride for their anniversary.
00:07:49.302,00:07:50.678,I had these made.
00:07:50.761,00:07:52.555,Doesn't your baby look cute?
00:07:52.638,00:07:55.600,"Well, it's not exactly the word I'd pick."
00:07:57.143,00:07:59.770,"New Graham Greene, huh? I've been wanting to read that."
00:07:59.854,00:08:03.691,"Well. I'm sorry, I can't lend it to you. It's due back at the library tomorrow."
00:08:03.774,00:08:05.985,"-Want me to return it for you? -No, thank you."
00:08:06.068,00:08:08.488,I will go to the library on the streetcar.
00:08:09.697,00:08:12.450,"Damn it, Mama. Would you quit being so stubborn?"
00:08:12.533,00:08:14.494,-You know perfectly well-- -Go on now.
00:08:14.577,00:08:17.455,Go on. You don't want to keep the horses waiting.
00:08:18.164,00:08:20.249,-Bye. -Bye.
00:08:32.929,00:08:34.305,Through that door making contact?
00:08:41.020,00:08:43.064,"-Oscar? -Right here, sir. Here I am."
00:08:43.147,00:08:45.858,"-Are you all right? -No, sir, I'm stuck."
00:08:45.942,00:08:48.402,I know. Fiddle with the lever.
00:08:48.486,00:08:51.155,It all fiddled out. I've done everything I know how.
00:08:52.949,00:08:56.077,"-Call Bell Elevator, Miss McClatchey. -I already did."
00:08:56.160,00:08:58.287,"Now, they're backed up, but they'll be here around one."
00:08:58.371,00:09:00.748,One? Did you tell them it's an emergency?
00:09:00.831,00:09:03.209,"Well, you don't have to holler at me, Mr. Werthan."
00:09:03.292,00:09:05.378,I didn't break the elevator.
00:09:06.337,00:09:08.464,You got that stuff for Davis and Paxon up there?
00:09:08.548,00:09:10.341,Wrapped and ready to go.
00:09:10.424,00:09:13.177,I told them they'd have it yesterday. Call Bell again.
00:09:16.889,00:09:19.350,"Oscar? Hey, Oscar."
00:09:19.433,00:09:20.476,"Yeah, I hear you."
00:09:21.519,00:09:23.896,Look up there where the gate is supposed to close.
00:09:23.980,00:09:26.232,There's a little doohickey hanging down there.
00:09:26.315,00:09:28.859,"Wait a minute. Yeah, uh-huh."
00:09:28.943,00:09:30.069,Right here.
00:09:30.152,00:09:33.489,Reach up and mash on it. Mash it up until it catches.
00:09:35.491,00:09:37.410,I done it. Now what?
00:09:37.493,00:09:39.287,Operate the lever.
00:09:46.460,00:09:47.920,"Nice going, Oscar!"
00:09:51.507,00:09:52.967,"Excuse me, do you work here?"
00:09:53.050,00:09:54.844,"Uh, no, sir. This here Hoke."
00:09:54.927,00:09:56.470,"Hoke Colburn, sir."
00:09:56.554,00:09:58.180,How do you know about the elevator?
00:09:58.264,00:10:00.683,"Oh, I used to drive for the Avondale Dairy, sir."
00:10:00.766,00:10:03.227,They had an old sorry elevator worse than this one here.
00:10:03.311,00:10:05.938,Don't you remember? Hoke the one I told you about.
00:10:06.022,00:10:07.231,"Oh, of course."
00:10:19.368,00:10:20.870,"Uh, excuse me, sir."
00:10:20.953,00:10:22.997,"You all people's Jewish, ain't you?"
00:10:23.080,00:10:24.915,"Yes, we are. Why do you ask?"
00:10:24.999,00:10:27.209,"Tell you the truth, I'd rather work for Jews."
00:10:27.293,00:10:32.715,"Oh, I know folks say they stingy and cheap and one thing or another, but don't be saying none of that around me."
00:10:32.798,00:10:35.384,"-Good to know you feel that way. -Oh, yes, sir."
00:10:56.656,00:10:57.948,What was your last job?
00:10:58.032,00:11:00.701,I went to work for Judge Harold Stone.
00:11:00.785,00:11:02.703,"He's another Jewish gentleman like yourself, sir."
00:11:02.787,00:11:04.163,You drove for Judge Stone?
00:11:04.246,00:11:06.248,"Seven years to the day, nearby."
00:11:06.332,00:11:08.501,I'd still be there if he didn't up and die.
00:11:08.584,00:11:11.629,Then Mrs. Stone asked me to move down to Savannah with her.
00:11:11.712,00:11:14.340,"Of course, my wife was dead by then, you know."
00:11:14.423,00:11:16.342,"But I said, No, thank you, ma'am."
00:11:16.425,00:11:19.470,"Well, see, I didn't want to be too far away from my grandbabies."
00:11:19.553,00:11:21.514,Judge Stone was a friend of my father's.
00:11:21.597,00:11:22.973,You don't say?
00:11:23.057,00:11:24.767,"-Have a seat. -Thank you, sir."
00:11:24.850,00:11:26.685,"Uh, later, Miss McClatchey."
00:11:30.189,00:11:33.275,Oscar said you needed somebody to drive for your family.
00:11:33.359,00:11:34.819,"Now, what am I gonna be doing?"
00:11:34.902,00:11:38.614,Taking your children to school and running your wife to the beauty parlor?
00:11:38.697,00:11:41.200,"-I don't have any children. What I need-- -Oh, that's a shame."
00:11:41.283,00:11:43.327,"Of course now, you're still a young man, sir."
00:11:43.411,00:11:45.204,I wouldn't worry too much about it.
00:11:46.038,00:11:48.040,"-Thank you. I won't. -Yes, sir."
00:11:48.124,00:11:51.043,"Hoke, what I'm looking for is somebody to drive my mother around."
00:11:51.127,00:11:52.378,You mother?
00:11:52.461,00:11:59.218,"Yes. Well, um, if you don't mind my asking, sir, how come she ain't hiring for herself?"
00:12:01.595,00:12:05.015,"-Well, it's a difficult situation. -Oh, yes, sir."
00:12:05.099,00:12:07.017,"So, she done gone around the bend a little bit."
00:12:07.101,00:12:09.395,"Well, now, that will happen as they get on, you know."
00:12:09.478,00:12:11.522,"-Oh, no, she's all there. -Oh, that's good."
00:12:11.605,00:12:13.482,Too much there is the problem.
00:12:16.527,00:12:19.029,"-Hoke, I want you to understand something. -Yes, sir."
00:12:19.113,00:12:23.534,"-My mother is a little high-strung. -Yes, sir."
00:12:23.617,00:12:26.662,"Now, the fact is, you'd be working for me."
00:12:26.745,00:12:31.125,"She can say anything she likes, but she can't fire you."
00:12:31.208,00:12:32.209,You understand?
00:12:33.419,00:12:34.545,"Yes, sir."
00:12:36.380,00:12:38.132,"Yes, sir. Yes, I sure do."
00:12:38.215,00:12:40.050,"And don't you worry none about it, Mr. Werthan."
00:12:40.134,00:12:43.053,I'm gonna hold on never mind which way she run me.
00:12:43.137,00:12:47.683,I remember when I was a little boy back there on the farm above Macon where I come from.
00:12:47.766,00:12:50.686,I used to wrestled hogs to the ground during killing time.
00:12:50.769,00:12:54.064,"And, well, sir, there ain't near a hog got away from me yet."
00:13:42.655,00:13:44.490,"How are you, ldella?"
00:13:44.573,00:13:45.783,Living.
00:13:45.866,00:13:47.952,Where's that new vacuum cleaner I brought over here?
00:13:48.035,00:13:50.621,-In the closet. -She won't touch it.
00:13:50.704,00:13:53.541,I would if it didn't give me a shock every time I'm near it.
00:13:53.624,00:13:55.125,It works for me.
00:13:55.209,00:13:58.837,Good! Then you clean and I'll go down and run your office.
00:14:00.047,00:14:01.423,Where's Mama?
00:14:01.507,00:14:03.050,Up yonder.
00:14:03.133,00:14:05.052,I guess you know who this is.
00:14:07.304,00:14:09.306,"-I'll be right back, Hoke. -Yes, sir."
00:14:13.310,00:14:19.108,I wouldn't be in your shoes if the sweet Lord Jesus come down and asked me himself.
00:14:29.034,00:14:30.202,"Morning, Mama."
00:14:40.004,00:14:42.798,All I'm asking is that you come down and say hello.
00:14:42.882,00:14:44.508,Now you listen here.
00:14:44.592,00:14:48.512,"Unless they rewrote the Constitution and didn't tell me, I still have rights."
00:14:48.596,00:14:49.805,"Of course, you do."
00:14:49.889,00:14:59.189,"What I do not want and absolutely will not have is some chauffeur sitting in my kitchen gobbling up my food, running up my phone bills."
00:14:59.273,00:15:02.359,"-Oh, I hate all that in my house. -You have ldella."
00:15:02.443,00:15:04.153,Idella's different.
00:15:04.236,00:15:06.030,She's been coming to me since you were in eighth grade.
00:15:06.113,00:15:08.324,And we know how to stay out of each other's way.
00:15:08.407,00:15:11.827,"And even so, there are nicks and chips in my wedding china."
00:15:11.911,00:15:15.456,You think ldella has a personal vendetta against your wedding china?
00:15:15.539,00:15:17.291,Don't be sassy.
00:15:17.374,00:15:20.336,"On Forsyth Street, we couldn't afford them and we did for ourselves."
00:15:20.419,00:15:24.381,"-That's still the best way, if you ask me. -Them? Afford them?"
00:15:25.299,00:15:28.469,"-You sound like Governor Talmadge. -Why, Boolie, what a thing to say!"
00:15:28.552,00:15:30.137,I'm not prejudiced.
00:15:30.220,00:15:31.972,Aren't you ashamed?
00:15:33.015,00:15:35.309,"You might as well try to make the best of it, Mama."
00:16:23.565,00:16:25.943,â€¦the difference being over 50 percent.
00:16:26.026,00:16:31.073,China: It appears that a decisive battle is shaping up north of the capital city of Nanjing.
00:16:31.156,00:16:34.660,It is predicted to be the biggest clash of 1948.
00:16:34.743,00:16:40.541,"Government forces moving south from the abandoned cityâ€¦ You know, I knew a Miss ldella once. Back down there in Macon."
00:16:40.624,00:16:42.668,You don't say?
00:16:42.751,00:16:43.961,Could sing!
00:16:44.044,00:16:46.463,What are you talking about?
00:16:46.547,00:16:49.008,I'm talking about this woman had some lungs!
00:16:49.091,00:16:52.261,"She'd have been a whole church choir by herself, if they'd let her."
00:16:52.344,00:16:53.929,I declare!
00:16:54.013,00:16:55.264,Fat too.
00:16:55.347,00:16:57.307,Woman about as big as that stove over here.
00:16:59.768,00:17:03.147,Don't talk to ldella. She has work to do.
00:17:03.230,00:17:08.986,â€¦United States transport plane has done nothing to dampen the resolve of the pilots on their mission of mercy.
00:17:15.034,00:17:18.120,Here. What do you think you're doing?
00:17:18.203,00:17:20.539,"I'm just dusting the bulbs, Miss Daisy."
00:17:20.622,00:17:23.333,That's the silliest thing I ever saw in my life.
00:17:23.417,00:17:25.711,Who cares if lamp bulbs are dusty?
00:17:25.794,00:17:28.297,-Get down from there. -Yessum.
00:17:28.380,00:17:30.632,And put that ladder away before somebody trips.
00:17:30.716,00:17:31.550,Yessum.
00:17:36.013,00:17:37.473,"I'm gone, Miss Daisy."
00:17:37.556,00:17:40.059,"All right, ldella. See you tomorrow."
00:17:40.809,00:17:43.729,"-I'm going too, Miss Daisy. -Good."
00:18:00.412,00:18:04.208,"Good morning, Miss Daisy. Thought I'd see after your zinnias."
00:18:04.291,00:18:06.668,You leave my flower bed alone.
00:18:06.752,00:18:08.170,Yessum.
00:18:08.253,00:18:12.925,"Well, you know, you got a nice piece of ground out there behind the garage that ain't doing nothing but just sitting there."
00:18:13.008,00:18:18.931,"I could put you in some tomatoes, butter beans, some-- If I want a vegetable garden, I'll plant it myself."
00:18:20.641,00:18:21.767,Yessum.
00:18:52.631,00:18:53.799,What are you doing there?
00:18:55.300,00:18:59.012,"Oh, Iâ€¦ I just love a house with pictures, Miss Daisy."
00:18:59.096,00:19:00.681,It do make a home.
00:19:00.764,00:19:03.892,I don't want you nosing through my things.
00:19:15.529,00:19:18.574,"-Good morning, Miss Daisy. -Good morning."
00:19:18.657,00:19:21.118,"It was right cold in the night, there, wasn't it?"
00:19:21.201,00:19:23.287,I wouldn't know. I was asleep.
00:19:24.371,00:19:25.789,Yessum.
00:19:27.875,00:19:31.336,ldella says we're running short on coffee and Dutch cleanser.
00:19:32.337,00:19:34.590,-We are? -Yessum.
00:19:34.673,00:19:37.593,-We're low on silver polish too. -Yessum.
00:19:38.302,00:19:39.511,I know.
00:19:41.013,00:19:44.141,I'm fixing to go to the Piggly Wiggly on the trolley.
00:19:44.224,00:19:48.187,"On the trolley? Why don't you let me carry you, Miss Daisy?"
00:19:48.270,00:19:49.479,"No, thank you."
00:19:49.563,00:19:51.815,"Well, ain't that what Mr. Werthan done hire me for?"
00:19:51.899,00:19:53.400,That's his problem.
00:19:54.318,00:19:58.030,"Well, all right, but I'm gonna find something to do around here."
00:19:58.113,00:19:59.823,You leave my things alone.
00:20:01.283,00:20:04.453,"-I'm gone to the market, ldella. -Yessum."
00:20:05.204,00:20:07.164,"Miss Daisy, now, it's just a shame."
00:20:07.247,00:20:11.001,You got this fine Hudson automobile sitting out there in the garage.
00:20:11.084,00:20:15.505,It ain't moved an inch from when Mr. Werthan drove it over here from Central Motors.
00:20:15.589,00:20:19.384,Seems like that insurance company gave you a brand-new car for nothing.
00:20:19.468,00:20:21.970,-That's your opinion. -Yessum.
00:20:22.054,00:20:33.774,"And my other opinion is a fine, rich, Jewish lady like yourself ain't got no business dragging herself up the steps of no trolley carrying no grocery store bags. I'll come along and carry them for you."
00:20:33.857,00:20:36.777,I don't need you. I don't want you.
00:20:36.860,00:20:39.655,"-And I don't like you saying I'm rich. -Well, I won't say it no more."
00:20:39.738,00:20:41.365,Is that what you and ldella talk about in the kitchen?
00:20:41.448,00:20:42.950,"-No, Miss Daisy. No, we-- -Oh, I hate this!"
00:20:43.033,00:20:46.078,I hate being discussed behind my back in my own house.
00:20:47.371,00:20:49.790,I was born on Forsyth Street.
00:20:49.873,00:20:52.292,"-Believe me, I know the value of a penny! -Yessum."
00:20:52.376,00:20:58.006,"My brother Manny, brought home a white cat one day and Papa said we couldn't keep it because we couldn't afford to feed it."
00:20:58.090,00:21:01.677,My sister saved up money so I could go to school to be a teacher.
00:21:01.760,00:21:04.346,-We didn't have anything! -Yessum.
00:21:04.429,00:21:06.932,But you're doing all right now.
00:21:30.414,00:21:31.957,What are you doing?
00:21:32.040,00:21:34.710,I'm trying to drive you to the store!
00:21:40.882,00:21:43.468,"Where are you off to this morning, Miss Werthan?"
00:21:43.552,00:21:45.846,"Oh, just a little shopping."
00:21:47.222,00:21:50.559,Go away. I've ridden the trolley with groceries plenty of times.
00:21:50.642,00:21:55.897,"Yes, I know, Miss Daisy, but I can't keep taking Mr. Werthan's money for doing nothing."
00:21:55.981,00:21:57.441,How much he pay you?
00:21:57.524,00:22:00.819,"Now, Miss Daisy, that's between him and me."
00:22:00.902,00:22:05.490,Anything over seven dollars a week is robbery. Highway robbery.
00:22:05.574,00:22:07.701,"Yessum, you sure are right about that."
00:22:07.784,00:22:12.039,Especially since I don't do nothing but sit in your kitchen on a stool all clay.
00:22:14.124,00:22:15.709,All right.
00:22:16.543,00:22:17.586,Piggly Wiggly.
00:22:18.503,00:22:21.506,-Then home. Nowhere else. -Yessum.
00:22:36.563,00:22:39.941,"Oh, I just love the smell of a new car."
00:22:40.025,00:22:41.401,"Don't you, Miss Daisy?"
00:22:45.489,00:22:47.532,"I'm nobody's fool, Hoke."
00:22:47.616,00:22:49.159,I know!
00:22:49.242,00:22:52.496,-My husband taught me to run a car. -Yessum.
00:22:52.579,00:22:54.998,I remember everything he said.
00:22:55.082,00:23:00.087,"So don't you think even for a second that you-- Now, wait. You're speeding."
00:23:00.170,00:23:01.838,"-I can see it. -No, Miss Daisy."
00:23:01.922,00:23:04.466,No. We're only doing about 19 miles an hour.
00:23:04.549,00:23:07.344,-I like to go under the speed limit. -Yessum.
00:23:07.427,00:23:09.554,But the speed limit is 35 here.
00:23:09.638,00:23:12.349,"The slower you go, the more you save on gas."
00:23:12.432,00:23:14.434,My husband taught me that.
00:23:16.812,00:23:21.066,You ain't hardly moving. Might as well walk to the Piggly Wiggly.
00:23:21.942,00:23:23.610,Is this your car?
00:23:25.403,00:23:28.031,-No. -Do you pay for the gas?
00:23:30.075,00:23:32.035,"-No. -All right, then."
00:23:32.119,00:23:38.583,"My fine son may think I'm losing my abilities, but I am still in control of what goes on in my car."
00:23:38.667,00:23:39.584,Yessum.
00:23:41.837,00:23:42.963,Where are you going?
00:23:44.256,00:23:46.341,"I'm taking you to the store, ma'am, like you said."
00:23:46.424,00:23:49.928,-Why didn't you turn on Highland Avenue? -Piggly Wiggly ain't on Highland.
00:23:50.011,00:23:54.307,"I know where it is. I want to go the way I always go, on Highland Avenue."
00:23:54.391,00:23:57.102,-But that's three blocks out of the way. -Go back. Go back this minute.
00:23:57.185,00:23:59.396,"-Well, I can't turn around now. -Go back, I said."
00:23:59.479,00:24:02.524,I've been driving to the Piggly Wiggly since they put it up and opened it for business.
00:24:02.607,00:24:04.276,"-Yes, but-- -This isn't the way!"
00:24:04.359,00:24:06.444,-Yessum it is. -Go back. Go back this minute.
00:24:06.528,00:24:09.823,"Miss Daisy, look. Yonder is the Piggly Wiggly. See?"
00:24:12.617,00:24:15.245,-Get ready to turn. -Yessum.
00:24:21.793,00:24:23.670,Look out! There's a little girl behind that car.
00:24:23.753,00:24:25.589,"Yessum, I see her. I got her."
00:24:25.672,00:24:28.049,-Pull in right here. -Yessum.
00:24:36.099,00:24:37.684,Wait a minute.
00:24:37.767,00:24:40.020,-Give me the keys. -Yessum.
00:24:45.192,00:24:47.611,-You stay right here by the car. -Yessum.
00:24:47.694,00:24:49.779,And you don't have to go telling everybody my business.
00:24:49.863,00:24:51.448,"Oh, no."
00:25:15.180,00:25:16.431,"Hello, Mr. Werthan?"
00:25:18.475,00:25:21.061,"Yes, sir, it's me. Guess where I'm at."
00:25:22.062,00:25:24.356,I just drove your mama to the store.
00:25:25.440,00:25:29.152,"Oh, you know, she flapped around some, but she's all right."
00:25:29.236,00:25:30.654,She's in the store.
00:25:31.988,00:25:35.825,"Oh, Lord, she just looked out the window and seen me on the phone, sir."
00:25:35.909,00:25:38.828,She's probably gonna throw a fit right there at the check-out counter.
00:25:40.497,00:25:44.751,"Yes, sir. You sure are right about that. It only took me six days."
00:25:44.834,00:25:48.338,Same time it took the Lord to make the world.
00:25:48.421,00:25:50.465,"Yes, sir. All right. Bye, now."
00:26:01.851,00:26:05.438,"Hey there, Oscar, Junior. How you old boys doing today?"
00:26:05.522,00:26:07.565,"How the old lady been treating you, Hoke?"
00:26:07.649,00:26:11.194,"Oh, man, I'll tell you one thing. She knows how to throw a fit."
00:26:12.737,00:26:13.989,What's so funny?
00:26:15.115,00:26:19.160,"Whyâ€¦ Why, nothing, Miss Daisy. We just carrying on."
00:26:19.244,00:26:22.330,Oscar and Junior have been doing my floor cleaning for 15 years.
00:26:22.414,00:26:23.623,They never carried on before.
00:26:24.582,00:26:26.793,-You leave them alone. -Yessum.
00:26:26.876,00:26:29.963,"-And put your coat on. We're late. -Yessum, be right there."
00:26:30.046,00:26:33.383,"-Idella, I'm gone now. -Yessum."
00:26:33.466,00:26:35.427,"I'm right behind her, ldella."
00:26:43.018,00:26:48.148,"Hear, oh, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one."
00:26:54.696,00:26:56.990,-I'm telling you. -What you talking about?
00:27:22.599,00:27:24.309,-Good Shabbas. -Good Shabbas.
00:27:24.392,00:27:26.603,-You got your hands full there. -Yes.
00:27:26.686,00:27:29.356,Good Shabbas. Good to see you.
00:27:29.439,00:27:32.525,Good Shabbas. Nice to see you.
00:27:32.609,00:27:34.402,-Such a nice man. -He is. He's lovely.
00:27:34.486,00:27:36.696,"And such a good, short sermon, wasn't it?"
00:27:44.746,00:27:46.831,I can get myself in.
00:27:46.915,00:27:48.708,"-Hurry up out of here. -Yes, ma'am."
00:28:05.433,00:28:07.352,"Is something wrong back there, Miss Daisy?"
00:28:07.435,00:28:09.020,No.
00:28:09.104,00:28:11.648,-Something I done? -No.
00:28:13.691,00:28:15.443,Yes.
00:28:15.527,00:28:17.153,"Miss Daisy, I ain't done nothing."
00:28:17.237,00:28:24.494,You had the car parked right in front of the front door of the temple like I was the Queen of Romania. Everybody saw you.
00:28:24.577,00:28:26.371,Didn't I tell you to wait for me in the back?
00:28:26.454,00:28:32.502,"Well, yessum, but I was just trying to-- There were two other chauffeurs right behind me there."
00:28:32.585,00:28:36.047,You made me look like a fool. A GD fool.
00:28:36.131,00:28:40.635,"Oh, Miss Daisy, Lord knows you ain't no fool."
00:28:40.719,00:28:41.761,Slow down.
00:28:44.013,00:28:49.561,"Miriam and Beulah and them, I could see what they were thinking -when we came out of the services. -What's that?"
00:28:50.687,00:28:52.981,That I was trying to pretend I was rich!
00:28:53.064,00:28:55.358,"-Well, you is rich, Miss Daisy. -No, I'm not."
00:28:55.442,00:28:57.861,And nobody can say I put on airs.
00:28:57.944,00:29:01.656,"On Forsyth Street, we made many a meal off of grits and gravy."
00:29:01.740,00:29:04.117,"I've done without plenty of times, I can tell you."
00:29:04.200,00:29:08.496,"Miss Daisy, if I was to ever get my hands on what you got?"
00:29:08.580,00:29:12.792,"Shoot, I'd be shaking it around for everybody in the world to see."
00:29:12.876,00:29:15.378,That's vulgar! Don't talk to me.
00:29:17.964,00:29:20.759,-Never gonna understand some white folks. -What?
00:29:20.842,00:29:22.927,What was that? I heard that.
00:29:23.011,00:29:29.184,"Now, Miss Daisy, you need a chauffeur, and Lord knows I need a job."
00:29:29.267,00:29:32.061,So why don't we just leave it like that?
00:30:26.574,00:30:27.700,Hello.
00:30:28.284,00:30:30.370,"Good morning, Mama. What's the matter?"
00:30:32.330,00:30:35.750,"No, I don't always think something's the matter when you call."
00:30:35.834,00:30:38.086,Just when you call so early in the morning.
00:30:39.796,00:30:40.839,What?
00:30:42.590,00:30:46.135,"All right, I'll be there as soon as I can."
00:30:50.932,00:30:53.226,I guess I'd better get on over there.
00:30:53.309,00:30:54.310,Bye.
00:30:55.395,00:30:56.729,"Come on, honey."
00:30:56.813,00:30:59.899,It's not healthy for you to rush like this in the morning.
00:30:59.983,00:31:01.818,"I eat too much, anyway."
00:31:02.777,00:31:05.697,"And besides, it sounds like she needs me."
00:31:05.780,00:31:08.783,When doesn't it? Give Mother Werthan my love.
00:31:11.244,00:31:12.579,-Bye. -Bye.
00:31:15.290,00:31:16.416,"Coffee, Katie Bell."
00:31:16.499,00:31:19.794,It's a brisk 38 degrees in downtown Atlanta.
00:31:29.178,00:31:31.347,I didn't expect to find you in one piece.
00:31:31.431,00:31:33.516,I wanted you to be here when he comes.
00:31:33.600,00:31:35.852,I wanted you to hear it for yourself.
00:31:35.935,00:31:37.645,Hear what? What's going on?
00:31:37.729,00:31:39.731,He's stealing from me.
00:31:40.565,00:31:42.692,Hoke? Are you sure?
00:31:42.775,00:31:44.402,I don't make empty accusations.
00:31:44.485,00:31:46.696,-I have proof. -What proof?
00:31:46.779,00:31:47.614,This!
00:31:47.697,00:31:51.242,I found this hidden in the garbage pail under some coffee grounds.
00:31:51.826,00:31:55.246,"-You mean, he stole a can of salmon? -Well, here it is!"
00:31:55.330,00:31:58.082,"Oh, I knew. I knew there was something funny."
00:31:58.166,00:32:01.836,"They all take things, you know. So I counted."
00:32:01.920,00:32:04.422,-You counted? -The silverware first.
00:32:04.505,00:32:08.092,And then the linen napkins. And then I went into the pantry.
00:32:09.302,00:32:15.725,And the first thing that caught my eye was a hole behind the lima beans.
00:32:15.808,00:32:17.560,And I knew right away.
00:32:19.604,00:32:22.690,There are only eight cans of salmon. I had nine.
00:32:22.774,00:32:24.233,Three for a dollar on sale.
00:32:24.317,00:32:25.902,"Very clever, Mama."
00:32:25.985,00:32:31.866,You made me miss my breakfast and be late to a meeting at the bank all for a 33-cent can of salmon?
00:32:31.950,00:32:34.035,"Here, you want 33 cents? Here's a dollar!"
00:32:34.118,00:32:35.244,Here's ten dollars. Go ahead.
00:32:35.328,00:32:37.205,Buy yourself a whole pantry full of salmon.
00:32:37.288,00:32:39.040,"Why, Boolie, the idea!"
00:32:39.123,00:32:41.501,Waving money at me like I don't know what!
00:32:41.584,00:32:44.212,I don't want the money. I want my things!
00:32:44.295,00:32:47.465,"-One can of salmon? -Well, it was mine!"
00:32:48.508,00:32:51.427,I leave him plenty of food every day.
00:32:51.511,00:32:54.097,And I always tell him exactly what it is.
00:32:54.180,00:32:58.059,"They're like having children in the house. They want something, they just take it."
00:32:58.142,00:32:59.811,"Oh, he'll never admit this."
00:32:59.894,00:33:03.231,"No, ma'am, he'll say, I don't know nothing about that."
00:33:03.314,00:33:04.232,I don't like it.
00:33:04.315,00:33:07.318,I don't like living this way. I have no privacy.
00:33:08.653,00:33:10.655,"-Mamaâ€¦ -Oh, go ahead."
00:33:10.738,00:33:12.907,Defend him. You always do.
00:33:12.991,00:33:14.492,"All right, I give up."
00:33:14.575,00:33:17.870,"You want to drive yourself again, go ahead and arrange it with the insurance company."
00:33:17.954,00:33:19.080,Take your blessed trolley.
00:33:19.163,00:33:22.458,Buy yourself a taxicab! Anything you want!
00:33:22.542,00:33:24.794,Just leave me out of it.
00:33:24.877,00:33:26.629,"Why, Boolie!"
00:33:31.551,00:33:35.304,"Now, what in the world you reckon he's doing here this time of morning?"
00:33:35.388,00:33:37.932,"Can't be good, I promise you that."
00:33:48.234,00:33:50.361,-Good morning. -Good morning.
00:33:50.445,00:33:51.863,"Good morning, Miss Daisy."
00:33:51.946,00:33:54.615,"You know, I think it's fixing to clear up out there."
00:33:55.742,00:33:58.077,"Excuse me, Mr. Werthan. You all busy?"
00:33:59.078,00:34:01.372,"I'm afraid we have to have a little talk, Hoke."
00:34:03.750,00:34:05.668,"All right, sir."
00:34:05.752,00:34:08.504,Just let me get out of my coat. I'll be right back.
00:34:12.550,00:34:13.676,"Uh, Miss Daisy."
00:34:14.635,00:34:19.015,"Yesterday while you were out visiting, I went and ate a can of your salmon."
00:34:19.098,00:34:25.438,"Now, I know you said to eat the leftover pork chops, but, well, they were kind of stiff."
00:34:25.521,00:34:29.233,So I stopped by the Piggly Wiggly this morning and I got you another can.
00:34:29.317,00:34:31.569,Do you want me to just go on and put it in the pantry here?
00:34:33.362,00:34:35.823,"-Yes, thank you, Hoke. -Yessum."
00:34:35.907,00:34:37.658,"I'll be right with you, Mr. Werthan."
00:34:39.994,00:34:42.914,"Well, I gotta get dressed now."
00:34:44.332,00:34:45.666,"Goodbye, son."
00:36:25.641,00:36:29.270,"You know, Miss Daisy, I was just thinking."
00:36:30.146,00:36:33.524,Here we done been out to this cemetery three times this month already.
00:36:33.608,00:36:35.318,It ain't even the 20th yet.
00:36:35.401,00:36:37.111,It's good to come in nice weather.
00:36:37.195,00:36:40.865,"Oh, yessum. You sure right about that. Sure is."
00:36:43.159,00:36:46.162,Mr. Sig's grave is mighty well-tended.
00:36:46.954,00:36:49.790,"You know, I think you're the best widow in the State of Georgia."
00:36:51.042,00:36:54.253,Boolie's always pestering me to have the staff out here tend to this plot.
00:36:55.254,00:36:57.048,"Perpetual care, they call it."
00:36:57.131,00:37:00.092,"Yessum. Well, don't you do it."
00:37:00.176,00:37:03.429,"No, it's right to have a member of the family looking after you."
00:37:03.512,00:37:05.681,"Oh, I'll certainly never have that."
00:37:05.765,00:37:08.226,Boolie will have me in perpetual care before I'm cold.
00:37:10.311,00:37:12.939,"Miss Daisy, you ought to go on away from here!"
00:37:14.815,00:37:16.067,-Hoke. -Yessum?
00:37:16.150,00:37:19.487,-Put that azalea on Leo Bauer's grave. -All right.
00:37:19.570,00:37:22.573,Leo Bauer. Is that Miss Rose Bauer's husband?
00:37:22.657,00:37:24.033,That's right.
00:37:24.116,00:37:26.285,She asked me to bring it out here for her.
00:37:26.369,00:37:27.411,All right.
00:37:27.495,00:37:30.289,"Well, where is his grave at, Miss Daisy?"
00:37:31.624,00:37:35.962,I'm not exactly sure. I know it's two rows over that way.
00:37:36.045,00:37:39.090,"-Two rows over that way. -You'll see the headstone, Bauer."
00:37:43.302,00:37:44.553,"Well, what's the matter?"
00:37:44.637,00:37:46.514,"Oh, nothing. Nothing wrong."
00:37:46.597,00:37:48.307,Nothing the matter at all.
00:37:48.891,00:37:50.518,Two rows that way.
00:37:51.644,00:37:53.020,Two rows.
00:37:53.938,00:38:00.903,"Now, Miss Daisy, you say-- I told you it's two rows over that way. It says Bauer on the headstone."
00:38:00.987,00:38:05.074,"Bauer, yessum. Nowâ€¦ What that look like, Miss Daisy?"
00:38:05.658,00:38:06.993,What are you talking about?
00:38:08.035,00:38:11.330,"Well, I'm talking about I can't read, ma'am."
00:38:12.498,00:38:15.334,"-What? -I can't read, Miss Daisy."
00:38:15.418,00:38:18.129,Then how come I see you looking at the paper all the time.
00:38:18.212,00:38:22.300,"Well, that's just it. I just be looking."
00:38:22.383,00:38:26.345,"Well, I kind of dope out what's going on from the pictures sometimes."
00:38:26.429,00:38:28.139,"You know your letters, don't you?"
00:38:28.222,00:38:31.892,"Oh, yes, ma'am. I know my ABC's pretty good. I just can't read."
00:38:32.476,00:38:34.812,Stop saying that. You're making me mad.
00:38:34.895,00:38:38.232,"-Yessum. -If you know your letters, then you can read."
00:38:38.316,00:38:40.943,-You just don't know you can read. -Ma'am?
00:38:41.027,00:38:44.780,I taught some of the stupidest children God ever put on the face of this earth.
00:38:44.864,00:38:47.700,And all of them could read well enough to find a name on a tombstone.
00:38:47.783,00:38:51.954,"Well, yessum, but, see-- -The name is Bauer. -Yessum."
00:38:52.038,00:38:58.544,Buhâ€¦ Bauer. What does that buh letter sound like?
00:39:00.379,00:39:02.548,-B? -Of course!
00:39:03.132,00:39:08.387,Erâ€¦ That's the last part. Bauer.
00:39:08.471,00:39:10.181,What letter sounds like er?
00:39:12.600,00:39:13.726,R!
00:39:13.809,00:39:16.062,-So the first letter is aâ€¦ -B.
00:39:16.145,00:39:18.522,-And the last letter is a? -R.
00:39:18.606,00:39:21.067,B-R. Buh-er.
00:39:21.150,00:39:23.402,"It even sounds like Bauer, doesn't it?"
00:39:23.486,00:39:28.032,"It sure do, Miss Daisy! It sure do!"
00:39:32.203,00:39:34.288,-That it? -That's it.
00:39:35.456,00:39:37.541,We ain't gonna worry about what come in the middle?
00:39:37.625,00:39:39.001,"No, not right now."
00:39:39.085,00:39:41.379,That'll be enough for you to find it. Go on now.
00:39:42.213,00:39:43.756,"Yessum, all right."
00:39:44.965,00:39:49.345,"B at the beginning, R at the end."
00:39:49.428,00:40:05.111,"B at the beginningâ€¦ B at the beginning, R at the end."
00:40:05.194,00:40:09.990,"B at the beginning, R at the end."
00:40:10.074,00:40:19.500,B at the beginningâ€¦ B-R.
00:40:20.334,00:40:21.669,That's his.
00:40:22.878,00:40:24.380,That's all right.
00:40:26.632,00:40:28.551,All right.
00:40:38.227,00:40:40.062,-Miss Daisy? -Yes?
00:40:41.439,00:40:43.399,I sure do appreciate this.
00:40:43.482,00:40:44.942,Don't be ridiculous.
00:40:45.025,00:40:49.196,"-I didn't do anything. -Well, nowâ€¦ -Let's get all this back in the car. -All right."
00:40:49.280,00:40:51.782,-I'm burning up out here. -Yessum.
00:40:52.825,00:40:53.951,Here we go.
00:41:15.097,00:41:17.224,Of course I told you!
00:41:17.308,00:41:20.186,"-Yes, ma'am. -Of course I told you!"
00:41:21.562,00:41:25.149,"Now, how can I be expected to buy it if you don't write it down?"
00:41:25.232,00:41:27.151,"I'm sorry, Miss Florine."
00:41:28.569,00:41:29.528,Honey.
00:41:30.738,00:41:34.241,Boolie! I need you!
00:41:34.325,00:41:36.285,"I'll be right there, honey."
00:41:36.368,00:41:39.788,Do you have any idea what it takes to give a Christmas reception? Do you?
00:41:39.872,00:41:41.999,"-No, ma'am. -It takes an eye for detail."
00:41:42.082,00:41:43.626,"Yessum. Yes, Miss Florine."
00:41:43.709,00:41:46.712,"I told you a million times, Katie Bell, write it down."
00:41:46.795,00:41:50.132,-Yessum. -More I cannot do.
00:41:50.216,00:41:51.800,We're out of coconut.
00:41:51.884,00:41:54.011,"I'm sure we'll be able to manage, Katie Bell."
00:41:54.094,00:41:57.515,-I told her. -But you didn't write it down!
00:41:57.598,00:42:01.727,"Now, I don't need to stand around and listen to excuses on Christmas Day."
00:42:01.810,00:42:05.231,Maybe you can figure out how to serve ambrosia to 50 people without coconut.
00:42:05.314,00:42:06.857,I give up!
00:42:11.320,00:42:15.491,"Don't worry, Katie Bell. It isn't quite the end of the world."
00:42:26.877,00:42:30.214,Everybody's giving the Georgia Power Company a Merry Christmas.
00:42:31.298,00:42:37.137,Bet Miss Florine got them all beat with them lights -especially with the new house. -Absurd.
00:42:37.221,00:42:41.976,If I had a nose like Florine I wouldn't go around saying Merry Christmas to anybody.
00:42:45.479,00:42:50.025,"Of course, though, you know, Miss Daisy, I really do enjoy Christmas at their house."
00:42:50.109,00:42:52.653,No wonder. You're the only Christian in the place.
00:42:52.736,00:42:54.488,"Well, they got that new cook."
00:42:54.572,00:42:59.868,"Oh, Florine never could keep help. Of course, it's none of my affair."
00:42:59.952,00:43:02.913,"-No. -Too much running around, if you ask me."
00:43:02.997,00:43:05.332,"The Garden Club this, the Junior League that."
00:43:05.416,00:43:08.002,As if any one of them would give her the time of day.
00:43:08.085,00:43:12.506,But she'd die before she'd fix a glass of iced tea for the Temple Sisterhood.
00:43:12.590,00:43:13.716,Yessum.
00:43:14.300,00:43:18.429,I just hope she doesn't take it into her head to sing this year.
00:43:23.559,00:43:27.062,Lord have mercy. Look what Miss Florine done.
00:43:27.146,00:43:30.941,"If her grandfather, old man Frietag, could see this."
00:43:31.025,00:43:32.818,What is it you say?
00:43:32.901,00:43:37.031,I bet he'd jump up out of his grave and snatch her bald head.
00:43:46.624,00:43:49.043,Jump up and snatch her bald head.
00:43:51.128,00:43:54.048,"Oh, Miss Daisy, you go on away from here."
00:44:03.223,00:44:04.099,Wait a minute.
00:44:05.142,00:44:08.062,"-This isn't a Christmas present. -No, ma'am."
00:44:08.145,00:44:10.814,-You know I don't give Christmas presents. -Yessum.
00:44:10.898,00:44:13.233,I just happened to run across it this morning.
00:44:14.485,00:44:16.070,"Well, go on, open it up."
00:44:23.744,00:44:25.079,"Well, look at that."
00:44:25.788,00:44:28.707,"Ain't nobody never gave me no book before, Miss Daisy."
00:44:30.751,00:44:33.629,Zaner Method Writing.
00:44:33.712,00:44:36.799,I always taught out of these. I saved a few.
00:44:38.050,00:44:40.594,"-It's faded, but it works. -Yessum."
00:44:40.678,00:44:43.180,"-If you practice, you'll write nicely. -Yessum."
00:44:43.263,00:44:44.807,"-But you have to practice. -Oh, yessum."
00:44:46.141,00:44:49.645,I taught Mayor Hartsfield out of the same book.
00:44:49.728,00:44:51.355,"I sure do thank you, Miss Daisy."
00:44:51.438,00:44:53.273,"-It's not a Christmas present. -Oh, no."
00:44:53.357,00:44:56.735,Jews haven't any business -giving Christmas presents. -Yessum.
00:44:56.819,00:44:59.363,And you don't have to go yapping about this to Boolie or Florine.
00:44:59.446,00:45:01.949,"Oh, no. This is between you and me."
00:45:03.992,00:45:05.994,"Merry Christmas, Mother Werthan."
00:45:06.078,00:45:08.414,I hope I don't spit up.
00:45:08.497,00:45:10.874,"Merry Christmas, Mama. Hoke."
00:45:10.958,00:45:12.126,"Hello, Hoke."
00:45:54.585,00:45:57.546,"-You know, she fought me on this one. -Yes, sir."
00:45:57.629,00:45:59.548,But it's time for a trade.
00:46:01.091,00:46:03.510,"I'll bet both of you will miss the old one, though."
00:46:03.594,00:46:06.722,"No, sir, I don't expect I'm gonna miss it all that much."
00:46:06.805,00:46:10.851,"Oh, come on, you're the only one who's been driving it all this time."
00:46:10.934,00:46:12.936,Won't you gonna be a little sorry to see it go?
00:46:13.020,00:46:16.273,"Oh, it ain't going nowhere. I done bought it."
00:46:16.356,00:46:18.859,"-You didn't. -Yes, sir, I sure did."
00:46:18.942,00:46:21.236,Already made the deal with Mr. Red Mitchell.
00:46:21.320,00:46:25.824,"-How much? -Oh, now, Mr. Werthan, that's for him and me to know."
00:46:25.908,00:46:27.493,"Hey, Boolie!"
00:46:27.576,00:46:29.203,Got a gem here.
00:46:29.286,00:46:30.621,"You got that paper for me, Hoke?"
00:46:30.704,00:46:32.789,"Oh, yes, sir. Got it right here."
00:46:32.873,00:46:34.166,"Be right in there, Red."
00:46:34.958,00:46:37.586,For God's sake. Why didn't you just buy it directly from Mama?
00:46:37.669,00:46:39.296,"-You would have saved money. -No, sir."
00:46:39.379,00:46:41.965,Your mama is in my business enough as it is.
00:46:42.049,00:46:45.219,I ain't studying about making no monthly car payments to her.
00:46:45.302,00:46:48.347,"No, sir, she's mine the regular way."
00:46:48.430,00:46:50.140,The Hudson's a good car.
00:46:50.224,00:46:52.476,I guess nobody knows that better than you.
00:46:52.559,00:46:54.645,Best ever come off the line.
00:46:54.728,00:47:02.236,"And here's your new one, if Miss Daisy don't take to it, wellâ€¦ I'm gonna let her ride in this one from time to time."
00:47:02.319,00:47:04.905,"-Mighty nice of you. -Well, you know."
00:47:04.988,00:47:06.365,We do what we can.
00:48:11.179,00:48:13.473,It's three after seven.
00:48:13.557,00:48:17.227,"Well, yessum. You said we were leaving at 15 to 8."
00:48:17.311,00:48:19.271,"At the latest, I said."
00:48:21.064,00:48:25.819,"Now, what business in the world you got dragging this mess out of the house by yourself?"
00:48:25.902,00:48:27.321,Who was here to help me?
00:48:27.404,00:48:29.740,"Oh, Lord have mercy!"
00:48:29.823,00:48:33.118,It don't take more than five minutes to load up the trunk of this car.
00:48:33.201,00:48:37.956,"Now, you're fixing to break both your arms and your legs before we even get out of the manor."
00:48:38.040,00:48:39.499,You're taking on too much here.
00:48:39.583,00:48:43.170,"-I hate doing things at the last minute. -Oh, what you talking about?"
00:48:43.253,00:48:45.464,You've been packed and ready to go for the last week and a half.
00:48:45.547,00:48:48.258,"-Here, give me that right there. -No, don't you touch that."
00:48:48.342,00:48:51.136,"Well, it sure is pretty. Is that Mr. Walter's present?"
00:48:51.219,00:48:54.264,Yes. It's fragile. I'll put it on the seat with me.
00:48:54.348,00:48:56.558,"All right. Good morning, Mr. Werthan."
00:48:56.642,00:48:59.895,"-Well, you nearly missed us. -Thought you were leaving at quarter of."
00:48:59.978,00:49:02.272,"-Oh, she's taking on. -Be still."
00:49:03.732,00:49:05.525,Florine bought this for Uncle Walter.
00:49:06.360,00:49:08.195,"Well, Mama, it's not a snake."
00:49:08.278,00:49:09.696,I think it's notepaper.
00:49:09.780,00:49:13.617,How appropriate. Uncle Walter can't see.
00:49:13.700,00:49:14.826,Maybe it's soap.
00:49:14.910,00:49:19.122,How nice that you take such an interest in your uncle's 90th birthday.
00:49:19.206,00:49:20.791,"Don't start up with me, Mama."
00:49:20.874,00:49:22.584,I cannot go to Mobile with you.
00:49:22.668,00:49:25.212,I have to go to New York for the convention.
00:49:25.295,00:49:27.130,The convention starts Monday.
00:49:27.214,00:49:29.341,And I know what else I know.
00:49:29.424,00:49:31.343,Just leave Florine out of it.
00:49:31.426,00:49:33.470,She wrote away eight months ago for those tickets.
00:49:33.553,00:49:36.765,I'm sure My Fair Lady is more important than your own flesh and blood.
00:49:36.848,00:49:39.309,-Mama. -Those Christians will be mighty impressed.
00:49:40.477,00:49:42.312,I can't talk to you when you're like this.
00:49:44.731,00:49:47.192,We're expected for a late supper in Mobile.
00:49:47.275,00:49:48.568,You'll be there.
00:49:49.319,00:49:51.697,I don't know how you gonna stand her -all day in that car. -I'm sure they'll fix crab.
00:49:51.780,00:49:54.241,"-All that trouble. -Oh, she doesn't mean that, Mr. Werthan."
00:49:54.324,00:49:55.742,She's just worked up.
00:49:55.826,00:49:58.745,-Here's $50 in case you run into trouble. -All right.
00:49:58.829,00:50:00.122,Don't show it to Mama!
00:50:01.206,00:50:04.501,-Have you got a map with you? -She got it in the back seat with her.
00:50:05.711,00:50:07.629,It's 7:16!
00:50:08.422,00:50:11.049,You ought to have a job on the radio announcing the time.
00:50:11.133,00:50:13.719,-I wanna miss rush hour. -You will.
00:50:13.802,00:50:17.180,Congratulate Uncle Walter for me and kiss everybody in Mobile.
00:50:18.765,00:50:20.142,Did you have the air-condition checked?
00:50:20.225,00:50:22.018,I told you to have the air-condition checked.
00:50:22.102,00:50:25.272,"Yessum, I got the air-condition checked."
00:50:25.355,00:50:28.608,I don't know what for. You don't ever allow me to turn it on.
00:50:28.692,00:50:29.818,Hush up.
00:50:32.529,00:50:33.697,Goodbye!
00:50:35.365,00:50:36.742,Good luck!
00:50:37.784,00:50:38.994,Good god!
00:50:59.014,00:51:00.348,-Turn left. -Yeah.
00:51:01.516,00:51:04.144,"No, right! Turn right."
00:51:46.478,00:51:49.981,I ever tell you about the first time I leave the State of Georgia?
00:51:50.065,00:51:51.358,When was that?
00:51:52.192,00:51:53.527,A few minutes back.
00:51:53.610,00:51:55.362,-Go on. -Yessum.
00:51:56.238,00:52:00.408,"Now, my daughter, she's married to a Pullman porter, you know."
00:52:00.492,00:52:02.494,She's always on the go.
00:52:03.620,00:52:07.415,"New York, Detroit, St. Louis."
00:52:08.834,00:52:14.005,"I say, Well, now, that's all well and good, Tommie Lee, but I just don't feel the need for it."
00:52:15.465,00:52:17.259,So here it is.
00:52:17.342,00:52:18.468,The first time.
00:52:19.928,00:52:21.471,"And I might tell you, Miss Daisy."
00:52:22.931,00:52:25.892,Alabama ain't looking like much so far.
00:52:58.592,00:53:01.303,Idella sure do stuff eggs good.
00:53:01.386,00:53:03.305,You stuff yourself good.
00:53:06.558,00:53:07.559,Yessum.
00:53:14.024,00:53:16.902,I was thinking about the first time I ever went to Mobile.
00:53:18.028,00:53:21.448,It was Walter's wedding. 1888.
00:53:21.531,00:53:26.369,1888! You were nothing but a little bitty thing.
00:53:26.453,00:53:27.662,I was 12.
00:53:28.496,00:53:30.749,We went on the train.
00:53:30.832,00:53:32.834,"Oh, I was so excited."
00:53:34.502,00:53:37.047,I'd never been in a wedding party.
00:53:37.130,00:53:39.132,And I'd never seen the ocean.
00:53:41.259,00:53:47.599,"Papa said it was the Gulf of Mexico and not the ocean, -but it was all the same to me. -Yessum."
00:53:48.934,00:53:53.939,I asked Papa if it was all right for me to dip my hand in the water.
00:53:55.065,00:53:57.817,And he laughed because I was so timid.
00:54:01.446,00:54:04.616,And then I tasted the salt water on my fingers.
00:54:09.829,00:54:12.165,Isn't that a silly thing to remember?
00:54:13.416,00:54:15.710,Ain't no sillier than what most folks remember.
00:54:17.253,00:54:18.421,"Hey, boy!"
00:54:19.589,00:54:20.715,"Yes, sir."
00:54:20.799,00:54:23.218,What do you think you're doing with this car?
00:54:23.301,00:54:25.595,"This is my car, officer."
00:54:26.179,00:54:29.391,"Yes, ma'am. Can I see your registration, please?"
00:54:29.474,00:54:31.559,"-And your license, boy. -Yes, sir."
00:54:42.070,00:54:44.656,What's this name? Wertheran?
00:54:44.739,00:54:46.741,-Werthan. -Werthan.
00:54:46.825,00:54:49.244,Never heard that one for. What kind of name is that?
00:54:49.327,00:54:51.454,It's of German derivation.
00:54:52.288,00:54:53.623,German derivation.
00:55:10.223,00:55:11.975,"Thank you, ma'am."
00:55:47.594,00:55:52.182,An old nigger and an old Jew woman taking off down the road together.
00:55:52.265,00:55:54.059,That is one sorry sight.
00:56:05.403,00:56:06.821,"-Oh, my god! -What?"
00:56:06.905,00:56:09.574,"The sign says, Phenix City, 30 miles."
00:56:09.657,00:56:13.411,"We're not supposed to go to Phenix City! Oh, my god!"
00:56:13.495,00:56:14.829,"Well, maybe you read it wrong."
00:56:14.913,00:56:19.084,I didn't. Stop the car.
00:56:19.167,00:56:21.002,Lord have mercy.
00:56:31.179,00:56:35.016,Here. You took the wrong turn at Opelika.
00:56:35.100,00:56:39.145,"Well, now, you took it with me, Miss Daisy. And you got the map."
00:56:39.229,00:56:42.357,"I was getting the lunch. Go on back. Oh, my god."
00:56:42.440,00:56:45.568,"Well, now, it ain't been more than 30 minutes since we turned."
00:57:27.360,00:57:29.195,They fixed crab for me.
00:57:29.946,00:57:33.450,Minnie always fixes crab. They go to so much trouble.
00:57:33.533,00:57:35.034,It's all ruined by now.
00:57:38.163,00:57:40.165,"We going to have to pull over, Miss Daisy."
00:57:40.248,00:57:41.666,Is something wrong with the car?
00:57:41.749,00:57:44.502,"No, there ain't nothing wrong with the car."
00:57:44.586,00:57:46.713,-I got to be excused. -What?
00:57:48.590,00:57:50.467,"I got to go make water, ma'am."
00:57:51.426,00:57:54.387,You should have thought of that back at the service station.
00:57:54.471,00:57:59.225,"Colored can't use the toilet at none of these service stations, Miss Daisy. You know that."
00:57:59.309,00:58:02.812,"Well, there's no time to stop. We'll be in Mobile soon. You can wait."
00:58:04.397,00:58:05.398,Yessum.
00:58:09.277,00:58:10.528,"No, ma'am."
00:58:13.198,00:58:16.451,"-I told you to wait. -Yessum, I heard what you said."
00:58:18.995,00:58:24.834,"How do you think I feel having to sit up here and ask you, Can I go make water, like I'm some child?"
00:58:25.543,00:58:26.878,Hoke! I'd be ashamed.
00:58:26.961,00:58:29.672,"Well, I ain't no child, Miss Daisy."
00:58:29.756,00:58:34.844,And I ain't just some back of the neck you look at while you're going wherever you got to go.
00:58:34.928,00:58:39.349,I'm a man. I'm near about 70 years old. And I know when my bladder's full.
00:58:40.975,00:58:45.688,Now I'm gonna get out of this car and go on off back over yonder somewhere and do what I got to do.
00:58:46.940,00:58:50.777,"And I'm gonna take the key with me too. Now, that's all there is to it, now."
00:59:17.929,00:59:18.763,Hoke!
00:59:28.398,00:59:29.732,Hoke!
00:59:35.113,00:59:36.614,Hoke?
00:59:50.587,00:59:52.297,"You all right, Miss Daisy?"
00:59:53.339,00:59:54.591,Of course I am.
00:59:59.095,01:00:03.349,"Hey, is that you, Slick? It's Boolie. How you doing?"
01:00:03.433,01:00:06.019,"Hey, congratulations on your dad's big day."
01:00:06.603,01:00:09.397,"Thank you, Boolie. Thank you. Aunt Daisy!"
01:00:13.651,01:00:16.070,-What? -It's Boolie on the phone.
01:00:18.031,01:00:21.576,"Hello. Hey, son."
01:00:21.659,01:00:24.329,Uncle Walter appreciates your call.
01:00:24.412,01:00:27.040,I don't think he can come to the phone.
01:00:27.123,01:00:28.875,Fine. How's Hoke?
01:00:28.958,01:00:31.085,What do you mean? How should he be?
01:00:32.086,01:00:34.005,"Happy birthday, Uncle Walter."
01:00:34.088,01:01:25.264,"-Oh, I gotta hang up now, Boolie. -For he's a jolly good fellow -Yeah, I'll tell him. Bye-bye. Bye. -For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can't deny I have tried to cut corners on this for you, butâ€¦ Morning, Miss McClatchey."
01:01:25.348,01:01:26.933,â€¦at 1961 prices.
01:01:27.016,01:01:28.935,"Well, good morning to you."
01:01:30.812,01:01:31.854,Can I see him?
01:01:32.730,01:01:34.941,"It's Mr. Sinclair Harris, sir."
01:01:35.024,01:01:38.069,-My cousin Sinclair? -His wife.
01:01:38.152,01:01:40.530,-Jeanette. -The one that talk funny.
01:01:40.613,01:01:43.116,"-Yeah, she's from Canton, Ohio. -Yes, sir."
01:01:43.199,01:01:45.702,"Well, she's trying to hire me."
01:01:47.453,01:01:52.375,"-What? -Yes, sir. She asked me, she said: How they treating you down there, Hoke?"
01:01:52.458,01:01:55.503,"You know how she sound, like her nose all stuffed up."
01:01:55.586,01:01:59.048,"So I said, Fine, Mrs. Harris, just fine, thank you, ma'am."
01:01:59.132,01:02:03.428,"She said, Well, you looking for a change, you know who to call."
01:02:03.511,01:02:05.680,"-I'll be damned. -Yes, sir."
01:02:05.763,01:02:07.598,I just thought you ought to know about it.
01:02:08.599,01:02:10.351,I'll be goddamned.
01:02:10.435,01:02:12.395,Ain't she a mess?
01:02:13.062,01:02:15.398,"Said, Name your own salary."
01:02:18.151,01:02:21.654,I see. And did you?
01:02:23.364,01:02:25.616,"-Did I what, sir? -Name your salary?"
01:02:25.700,01:02:28.578,"Oh, go away from here, Mr. Werthan. What you think I am?"
01:02:28.661,01:02:32.457,"I ain't studying about going to work for no trashy something like her. No, sir."
01:02:34.292,01:02:36.919,"But she got you thinking, didn't she?"

01:02:48.473,01:02:51.851,"Well, how does $65 a week sound?"
01:02:51.934,01:02:54.937,"Why, sounds pretty good, sir."
01:02:56.022,01:03:00.067,"Course, um, 75 sounds better."

01:03:05.907,01:03:07.450,Beginning this week.
01:03:10.411,01:03:12.455,"That's mighty nice of you, Mr. Werthan."
01:03:12.538,01:03:14.582,I sure appreciate this. Thank you.
01:03:17.168,01:03:18.002,Mr. Werthan?
01:03:19.295,01:03:21.297,You ever have folks fighting over you?
01:03:22.548,01:03:23.382,No.
01:03:25.134,01:03:26.469,It sure feels good.

01:03:47.824,01:03:51.661,"-Mah-jongg. -Oh, you are the luckiest thing, Beulah."
01:03:53.996,01:03:55.122,Excuse me a second.
01:04:00.253,01:04:05.967,"As such, I don't play ball with anybody."
01:04:06.050,01:04:10.596,"If you wanna save time, the best thing you can doâ€¦ I don't know how you all can look at that."
01:04:10.680,01:04:13.307,â€¦you know about the murder of Victor Carlson.
01:04:13.391,01:04:15.434,"See it a few times, you get in it."
01:04:16.769,01:04:19.188,Both your brains are fixing to evaporate.
01:04:20.690,01:04:23.526,"-You can bring the cake now, Hoke. -Yessum."
01:04:23.609,01:04:25.820,"Don't make a mess with those peas, ldella."
01:04:25.903,01:04:27.321,Do I ever?
01:04:28.698,01:04:32.451,"Lord have mercy, look at that. Ain't she got a lot of hair?"
01:04:32.535,01:04:34.495,Wonder how she get it so shiny.
01:04:34.579,01:04:36.330,Washes it in mayonnaise.
01:04:37.123,01:04:39.959,"-Go on away from here, ldella. -Yes, she did."
01:04:40.042,01:04:42.169,I read it in LIFE magazine.
01:04:42.253,01:04:46.257,"I am talking to a murdererâ€¦ Don't seem human, does it?"
01:04:47.216,01:04:49.343,He will tear you to shreds!
01:04:49.427,01:04:53.097,I am not going into that court and I'm not giving in!
01:04:53.180,01:04:55.892,"I tell you, you're at the end of your rope."
01:04:55.975,01:04:58.603,You murdered Victor Carlson. You're gonna have to pay for it.
01:04:58.686,01:05:06.986,Now either you choose the easy way out or else you go into that court and let Mr. Carl carve you into pathetic little bits.
01:05:07.069,01:05:09.614,You've got about a minute to make up your mind.
01:05:13.826,01:05:16.495,"What happened? She up to something, ain't she?"
01:05:21.751,01:05:22.710,Idella?
01:05:25.630,01:05:26.464,Idella?
01:05:27.632,01:07:00.725,What a friend we have In Jesus All our sins and griefs To bear What a privilege To carry Everything to God In prayer Can we find a friend So faithful Ooh Who will all our sorrows Share Ooh Jesus knows Our every weakness Just take it to the Lord In prayer -You fixing to ruin it. -What are you talking about?
01:07:00.808,01:07:04.770,"Well, you got the chicken too close together there and the fire is way too high."
01:07:04.854,01:07:06.188,Mind your business.
01:07:07.273,01:07:09.692,"Well, it's your chicken."
01:07:31.672,01:07:33.299,"-Thank you, Hoke. -Yessum."
01:07:33.382,01:07:34.884,"Now, you enjoy it."
01:07:54.737,01:07:56.238,Amen.
01:09:31.792,01:09:33.085,Who is it?
01:09:33.169,01:09:35.129,"Morning, Miss Daisy."
01:09:35.212,01:09:39.592,"Oh, Hoke, what in the world."
01:09:40.176,01:09:41.719,"Oh, shoot."
01:09:41.802,01:09:45.931,I learned how to drive on ice when I was delivering milk for the Avondale Dairy.
01:09:46.891,01:09:48.100,Ain't nothing to it.
01:09:49.226,01:09:53.189,These other folks out there are banging into each other like they're in the funny papers.
01:09:55.316,01:09:59.778,"I figured your stove was out, so I stopped by the Krispy Kreme."
01:09:59.862,01:10:02.698,I know you got to have your coffee in the morning.
01:10:03.324,01:10:05.659,"-How sweet of you, Hoke. -Yeah."
01:10:07.953,01:10:11.916,"Shoot, we ain't had any good coffee around here since ldella passed."
01:10:12.791,01:10:14.835,I can fix her biscuits.
01:10:14.919,01:10:17.213,And we both know how to make her fried chicken.
01:10:18.047,01:10:19.798,But nobody can make ldella's coffee.
01:10:20.382,01:10:22.009,Ain't that the truth?
01:10:27.973,01:10:29.642,Idella was lucky.
01:10:32.061,01:10:33.020,Yessum.
01:10:35.814,01:10:37.483,I expect she was.
01:10:48.953,01:10:53.791,Wellâ€¦ Where are you going?
01:10:55.042,01:10:57.544,"I'm just gonna go out here, take these things off."
01:10:57.628,01:11:01.507,"I don't know what you can do here today, except keep me company."
01:11:01.590,01:11:05.970,Wellâ€¦ Then I'll see if I can make us a fire.
01:11:08.347,01:11:10.724,Eat anything you want out of the ice box.
01:11:11.267,01:11:13.894,"-It'll all spoil, anyway. -Yessum."
01:11:14.687,01:11:18.232,And wipe up what you tracked onto my floor.
01:11:18.315,01:11:21.068,"What do you think I am, a mess?"
01:11:24.238,01:11:29.118,"-Hello? -Oh, Mama, I'll be right out after as soon as I can get down my own driveway."
01:11:29.201,01:11:32.121,"Stay where you are, Boolie. Hoke is here with me."
01:11:32.204,01:11:33.872,How the hell did he manage that?
01:11:33.956,01:11:38.210,He's very handy. I'm fine. I don't need a thing in the world.
01:11:38.294,01:11:40.671,Hello? I must have the wrong number.
01:11:40.754,01:11:43.382,I never heard Mama say loving things about Hoke before.
01:11:43.465,01:11:46.427,I didn't say I love him. I said he was handy.
01:11:47.303,01:11:48.929,"Honestly, Boolie."
01:11:49.013,01:11:52.099,Are you trying to irritate me in the middle of an ice storm?
01:11:57.688,01:11:58.772,"Thank you, Wellborn."
01:11:59.898,01:12:00.858,Thank you all.
01:12:02.109,01:12:14.121,I am deeply grateful to be chosen as 1966 Man of the Year by the Atlanta Business Council an honor which I've seen bestowed on some mighty fine fellows and one which I never expected would come to me.
01:12:15.581,01:12:24.631,I'm afraid that my loss up here and my gain down here have given me an air of competence I don't really possess.
01:12:25.507,01:12:29.720,But I will tell you that I wish my father and grandfather could see this.
01:12:29.803,01:12:36.852,"About 72 years ago, they leased an old mill up on Decatur Road with I believe 25 looms in operation."
01:12:37.644,01:12:39.855,They managed to grow along with Atlanta.
01:12:39.938,01:12:44.193,"And to this day, the Werthan Industries believe what we want is what Atlanta wants."
01:12:45.152,01:12:49.114,And this award I guess just proves that we were right.
01:12:49.198,01:12:50.282,And I thank you.
01:13:21.355,01:13:22.272,Well?
01:13:23.774,01:13:25.859,What is it? What took you so long?
01:13:27.236,01:13:31.281,"Oh, I couldn't help it, Miss Daisy. There's a big mess up yonder."
01:13:31.365,01:13:32.825,What's the matter?
01:13:32.908,01:13:35.828,I might as well not go to the temple at all now.
01:13:35.911,01:13:40.624,"No, ma'am, you ain't gonna be able to go to temple this morning, Miss Daisy."
01:13:40.707,01:13:43.460,Why not? What in the world is the matter with you?
01:13:45.379,01:13:47.756,Somebody done bombed the temple.
01:13:48.340,01:13:52.344,-What? Bombed the temple? -Yessum.
01:13:52.428,01:13:54.972,That's how come we stuck here so long.
01:13:55.055,01:13:56.765,I don't believe it.
01:13:56.849,01:13:59.726,"Well, that's what the policeman just said."
01:14:01.353,01:14:04.731,"Oh, no. Oh, my god."
01:14:04.815,01:14:06.984,"Well, was anybody there? Were people hurt?"
01:14:07.067,01:14:09.736,I don't know. He didn't say.
01:14:09.820,01:14:11.822,Who would do such a thing?
01:14:12.865,01:14:17.661,"You know good as me, Miss Daisy. It always be the same ones."
01:14:39.683,01:14:42.728,I remember one time back down there in Macon.
01:14:42.811,01:14:47.816,"Lord, I couldn't have been no more than 10 or 11 years old, I reckon."
01:14:47.900,01:14:50.027,"I had this friend, name of Porter."
01:14:50.819,01:14:54.573,"One day, there his daddy was hanging in a tree."
01:14:54.656,01:14:59.369,"Now, just the day before, we'd all been pitching horseshoes, see?"
01:14:59.453,01:15:07.336,"Him laughing and carrying on and talking about how me and Porter was gonna have strong right arms, just like him."
01:15:08.587,01:15:12.841,"Lord, there he was, hanging up yonder in the tree."
01:15:12.925,01:15:16.887,Had his hand tied behind him. Flies was all over him.
01:15:17.804,01:15:20.849,"I tell you, I just threw up right there where I was standing."
01:15:23.310,01:15:24.895,You go on and cry.
01:15:26.647,01:15:27.981,I'm not crying.
01:15:30.442,01:15:32.528,Why did you tell me that story?
01:15:33.445,01:15:35.864,"Lord, I don't know, Miss Daisy."
01:15:35.948,01:15:39.576,"Just seemed like that, mess back there put me in mind of it."
01:15:39.660,01:15:42.829,That's ridiculous. The temple has nothing to do with that.
01:15:42.913,01:15:44.581,"Yessum, if you say so."
01:15:44.665,01:15:46.500,We don't even know what happened.
01:15:46.583,01:15:48.752,How do you know that policeman was telling you the truth?
01:15:48.835,01:15:51.630,"Well, why would he go and lie about a thing like that?"
01:15:51.713,01:15:54.508,"Well, you never get things right anyway."
01:15:54.591,01:15:57.844,"Now, Miss Daisy, somebody done bombed that temple back yonder and you know it."
01:15:57.928,01:16:00.597,Go on. Just go on now. I don't want to hear any more about it.
01:16:03.350,01:16:05.894,-You the boss. -Don't talk to me.
01:16:25.247,01:16:26.373,Mama?
01:16:27.833,01:16:30.210,-Where are you? -Up here.
01:16:39.636,01:16:42.556,"Hello, Mama. How are you feeling?"
01:16:42.639,01:16:46.560,Not a good question to ask somebody nearly 90.
01:16:46.643,01:16:48.353,"Well, you look fine."
01:16:48.437,01:16:50.606,It's my ageless appeal.
01:16:52.524,01:16:54.651,"Well, Miss McClatchey gave me a message."
01:16:54.735,01:16:58.196,-Florine is invited too. -Thank you.
01:16:58.280,01:17:01.283,I guess Hoke should drive us. There'll be a crowd.
01:17:02.409,01:17:04.745,"Mama, we have to talk about this."
01:17:04.828,01:17:06.455,Talk about what?
01:17:06.538,01:17:08.957,About the feasibility of all this.
01:17:09.041,01:17:13.253,"You know, I believe Martin Luther King has done some mighty fine things."
01:17:13.337,01:17:17.049,"Boolie, If you don't want to go, why don't you just come right out and say so?"
01:17:17.132,01:17:20.260,I want to go. You know how I feel about him.
01:17:20.344,01:17:24.348,"Of course, but Florineâ€¦ Florine has nothing to do with it."
01:17:24.431,01:17:26.475,I still have to conduct business in this town.
01:17:26.558,01:17:27.851,I see.
01:17:27.934,01:17:31.563,Werthan Bag will go out of business if you attend the King dinner.
01:17:31.647,01:17:36.860,Not exactly. But a lot of men I do business with wouldn't like it.
01:17:36.943,01:17:44.993,They might snicker a little andâ€¦ call me Martin Luther Werthan behind my back.
01:17:48.705,01:17:51.750,Maybe I wouldn't hear about certain lunch meetings at The Commerce Club.
01:17:52.501,01:17:57.589,"And old Jack Raphael at Ideal Mills, you know, he's a New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew."
01:17:57.673,01:18:00.300,"And all the really smart ones come from New York, don't they?"
01:18:01.343,01:18:05.722,Some of the boys might start throwing their business to Jack instead of the old Martin Luther Werthan.
01:18:07.432,01:18:10.602,I don't know. Maybe it wouldn't happen.
01:18:11.520,01:18:13.814,But sometimes that's the way things work.
01:18:15.482,01:18:19.319,"Anyway, if we don't use those seats, somebody else will."
01:18:19.403,01:18:23.240,If we don't use those seats? I'm not supposed to go either?
01:18:23.323,01:18:24.991,"Well, Mama, you can do whatever you want."
01:18:25.075,01:18:27.202,"Oh, thanks for your permission."
01:18:28.328,01:18:30.122,Can I ask you something?
01:18:30.205,01:18:33.166,When did you get so fired up about Martin Luther King?
01:18:33.250,01:18:35.460,"Time was, I'd have heard a different story."
01:18:35.544,01:18:36.753,"Why, Boolie!"
01:18:36.837,01:18:39.923,I've never been prejudiced in my life and you know it.
01:18:40.799,01:18:43.927,"Okay. Well, then why don't you ask Hoke to go with you?"
01:18:44.010,01:18:46.847,Hoke? Don't be ridiculous. He wouldn't go.
01:18:48.932,01:18:50.392,Ask him and see.
01:19:06.199,01:19:07.159,All right.
01:19:08.452,01:19:09.494,Yessum.
01:19:49.576,01:19:52.245,Boolie said the silliest thing the other day.
01:19:55.624,01:19:57.000,"Well, what did he say?"
01:19:57.584,01:19:59.669,"Well, he was talking about Martin Luther King."
01:19:59.753,01:20:00.712,"Oh, yessum."
01:20:00.796,01:20:02.422,"I guess you know him, don't you?"
01:20:02.506,01:20:05.425,"Martin Luther King? No, ma'am, I don't know him."
01:20:05.509,01:20:06.968,I was sure you did.
01:20:07.803,01:20:09.137,But you've heard him preach?
01:20:09.221,01:20:10.472,"Oh, yessum."
01:20:11.723,01:20:14.643,"Same way you have, though. You know, on the TV."
01:20:14.726,01:20:17.687,-I think he's wonderful. -Yessum.
01:20:22.067,01:20:24.986,"-What you getting at, Miss Daisy? -Well, it's so silly."
01:20:25.070,01:20:29.866,Boolie said you wanted to go with me to this dinner. Did you tell him that?
01:20:30.534,01:20:32.702,"-No, I didn't. -I didn't think so."
01:20:32.786,01:20:36.248,What'd be the point? You can hear him whenever you want.
01:20:38.041,01:20:41.169,I think it's wonderful the way things are changing.
01:21:01.356,01:21:05.694,"-Now, what you think I am, Miss Daisy? -What do you mean?"
01:21:05.777,01:21:09.906,The invitation to this here dinner came in the mail a month ago.
01:21:09.990,01:21:18.290,"Now, if did be you wanted me to go with you how come you wait until we in the car and on the way before you asked me?"
01:21:18.373,01:21:22.210,What? All I said was Boolie said you wanted to go.
01:21:22.294,01:21:27.340,"Well, next time you want me to go somewhere, you ask me regular."
01:21:27.424,01:21:31.720,"-You don't have to carry on so much. -Well, now, let's just leave it alone."
01:21:31.803,01:21:33.513,"Oh, honestly."
01:21:37.726,01:21:41.855,Talk about things changing. They ain't changed all that much.
01:21:49.112,01:21:50.572,"Well, I'll help you to the door."
01:21:50.655,01:21:53.325,"Thank you, Hoke, I can help myself."
01:22:02.918,01:22:07.339,â€¦can see that the South has marvelous possibilities.
01:22:07.422,01:22:18.308,"Yet in spite of these assets segregation has placed the whole South socially, educationally, and economically behind the rest of the nation."
01:22:18.391,01:22:33.949,"Yet there are in the white South millions of people of good will, whose voices are yet unheard, whose course is yet unclear, and whose courageous acts are yet unseen."
01:22:34.032,01:22:44.209,"These millions are called upon to gird their courage, to speak out to offer leadership that is needed."
01:22:44.292,01:23:00.642,History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people but the appalling silence and indifference of the good people.
01:23:00.725,01:23:12.612,And our generation will have to repent not only for the words and acts of the children of darkness but also for the fears and apathy of the children of light.
01:23:40.140,01:23:42.100,"Morning, Miss Daisy."
01:24:12.505,01:24:14.007,Miss Daisy?
01:24:17.135,01:24:21.056,Hoke? Is that Hoke?
01:24:21.139,01:24:23.933,"-Yes, it's me. You all right? -Oh, Hoke."
01:24:24.017,01:24:25.435,-Hoke. -Yessum.
01:24:25.518,01:24:27.937,-What did you do with my papers? -What papers?
01:24:28.021,01:24:34.861,My papers! I had them all corrected last night and I put them out in front so I wouldn't forget them on my way to school.
01:24:34.944,01:24:36.613,"Now, what did you do with them?"
01:24:36.696,01:24:38.531,School? What are you talking about?
01:24:38.615,01:24:42.744,The children will be so disappointed if I don't give them their homework back.
01:24:42.827,01:24:46.081,I always give it back the next day.
01:24:46.164,01:24:47.707,That's why they like me.
01:24:47.791,01:24:49.584,"Oh, Lord, you talking out your head."
01:24:49.667,01:24:52.045,-Why aren't you helping me? -All right.
