00:00:33.237,00:00:45.625,LITTLE DETECTIVES TOBY &amp; TERI We've got tomatoes and lettuce and carrots and sweet corn and blue corn.
00:00:45.708,00:00:47.583,All we need are acorns.
00:00:47.667,00:00:50.083,And I know just where to get them.
00:00:50.661,00:00:52.333,"Up in oak trees, right?"
00:00:52.417,00:00:58.542,Unless I already found all the best acorns and hid them someplace super secret.
00:00:58.625,00:01:02.292,The best acorns make the very best acorn pie.
00:01:02.690,00:01:03.577,Come on!
00:01:12.917,00:01:16.409,"Okay, we go four steps this way."
00:01:23.090,00:01:24.500,Then four steps back.
00:01:27.964,00:01:29.417,Kick and turn?
00:01:29.500,00:01:37.500,"Yes. Then to the right again, And this is where I hid the acorns."
00:01:42.868,00:01:43.708,What's wrong?
00:01:50.458,00:01:52.042,They're gone.
00:01:54.483,00:01:55.958,You're sure they're gone?
00:01:56.320,00:02:00.375,"We did Bean's dance four times, always ended up in the same spot."
00:02:00.999,00:02:03.083,And my acorns aren't there!
00:02:03.167,00:02:04.750,Someone took 'em!
00:02:05.125,00:02:08.542,"Don't worry, Bean. We'll find your missing acorns."
00:02:08.625,00:02:10.708,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:02:10.792,00:02:12.458,Will you excuse us?
00:02:12.542,00:02:14.542,To the treehouse!
00:02:22.684,00:02:24.353,That's what we need to figure out.
00:02:24.436,00:02:26.750,Bean really loves his acorns.
00:02:26.833,00:02:28.542,There's a lot at stake.
00:02:28.625,00:02:31.833,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:02:31.917,00:02:33.410,Let's do this.
00:03:21.292,00:03:23.705,I found an acorn cap!
00:03:29.292,00:03:32.000,"Bean, is this from one of your missing acorns?"
00:03:34.292,00:03:37.208,"Mm, yeah! It's one of mine."
00:03:37.292,00:03:39.375,And look. There are marks on it.
00:03:41.375,00:03:44.042,Hmm. Teeth marks.
00:03:44.125,00:03:46.958,Someone's not just taking your acorns.
00:03:47.042,00:03:48.458,They're eating them.
00:03:48.542,00:03:51.000,So how do we catch an acorn thief?
00:03:51.485,00:03:53.292,We need another acorn.
00:03:53.375,00:03:55.667,One our thief can't resist.
00:03:55.750,00:03:57.833,Feel like a little arts and crafts?
00:03:57.917,00:04:00.750,I always feel like arts and crafts.
00:04:12.752,00:04:13.792,All done.
00:04:15.661,00:04:16.917,-Wow! -Yum!
00:04:17.000,00:04:18.750,-Amazing! -Delicious.
00:04:19.275,00:04:23.292,It's a fake acorn. I call it the Fakecorn 5000.
00:04:23.662,00:04:25.708,Looks good enough to eat!
00:04:26.227,00:04:28.405,Let's hope our thief takes the bait.
00:04:33.737,00:04:43.708,I'll just set this yummy acorn down right here and then turn my back and walk away.
00:04:49.125,00:04:50.292,"Teri, quick!"
00:05:01.625,00:05:04.083,Whoa! Toby! Teri! Over here!
00:05:09.542,00:05:13.845,"I saw him! He was here, but I guess he wasn't fooled, so he left."
00:05:13.970,00:05:15.292,Where'd he go?
00:05:15.667,00:05:21.667,"It's okay. If you know what he looked like, Millie can draw a picture. That'll help us find him."
00:05:21.750,00:05:22.750,Mm-hmm.
00:05:24.125,00:05:25.458,His face was rounder.
00:05:25.542,00:05:27.042,"Oh, and he looked hungry."
00:05:27.493,00:05:29.292,"No, hungrier."
00:05:32.500,00:05:33.708,What do you think?
00:05:33.792,00:05:36.417,"Great job, Millie. It looks just like him."
00:05:36.918,00:05:38.833,You know who that looks like?
00:05:39.213,00:05:41.292,"Rocco, the pika."
00:05:43.875,00:05:47.458,"Me, steal Bean's acorns? No way!"
00:05:47.542,00:05:50.542,"Look at this picture, Rocco. Tell me that's not you."
00:05:50.625,00:05:53.625,It's not! Look at the ears. They're tiny!
00:05:53.708,00:05:56.250,"And he's got a tail, a long one."
00:05:56.333,00:05:57.500,Look at me.
00:05:57.583,00:06:00.625,I'm somewhat lacking in the tail department.
00:06:00.708,00:06:03.167,And look at those big front claws.
00:06:03.250,00:06:04.500,Those are for digging.
00:06:04.583,00:06:07.833,Trust me. That guy lives underground.
00:06:07.917,00:06:10.000,That's why we didn't see him.
00:06:10.083,00:06:12.083,Lives in the ground.
00:06:12.167,00:06:16.083,Has a long tail and tiny ears.
00:06:16.167,00:06:19.375,Yup. What we're looking for is a vole.
00:06:19.458,00:06:21.500,"That's a vole, all right."
00:06:21.583,00:06:24.958,"Gonna be tough to find, digging underground and all."
00:06:25.042,00:06:28.250,If only we could hear him moving around down there.
00:06:28.333,00:06:31.625,Maybe we can. I'm gonna need acorns...
00:06:31.708,00:06:33.583,and some bells.
00:06:41.792,00:06:45.583,"If the vole grabs any of these acorns, the bells will ring."
00:06:45.667,00:06:50.000,"So even if we can't see underground, we'll be able to follow the sound."
00:06:53.000,00:06:55.000,That's him! Follow those bells!
00:07:13.333,00:07:14.917,We lost him!
00:07:15.000,00:07:18.410,"It's okay. Just spread out, and keep your ears open."
00:07:29.792,00:07:31.000,"Okay, bells!"
00:07:31.083,00:07:33.500,"One, two, three, ring!"
00:07:35.792,00:07:37.000,"Okay, bells!"
00:07:37.083,00:07:39.917,"One, two, three, ring!"
00:07:42.202,00:07:43.292,Last chance.
00:07:43.375,00:07:49.042,"One, two-- We've got him! Over here!"
00:07:55.370,00:07:57.083,It's coming from over here.
00:07:59.479,00:08:03.123,This must be where he lives. He's down there somewhere.
00:08:03.500,00:08:05.740,And so are my acorns.
00:08:38.292,00:08:40.708,What are you doing? Those things are mine.
00:08:40.792,00:08:44.292,They are not! I got them out of a big old oak tree.
00:08:44.375,00:08:47.542,"They grow in the ground, where I found 'em."
00:08:47.625,00:08:49.542,"No, they don't!"
00:08:50.583,00:08:51.750,Look!
00:08:55.208,00:08:57.667,You put those there. It's a trick.
00:08:59.417,00:09:03.000,I think we should all relax a little and talk about this.
00:09:06.408,00:09:14.583,"And so, you see, acorns grow up in trees, but when they're ripe they fall to the ground and sprout into new trees, so you're both actually right."
00:09:14.667,00:09:19.042,You can get acorns from high up in the trees and also from the ground.
00:09:19.125,00:09:24.958,I guess it makes sense how you'd think the acorns grew in the ground.
00:09:25.042,00:09:27.333,I just never knew they came from trees.
00:09:27.417,00:09:28.917,Why do you bury them?
00:09:29.000,00:09:33.750,"So I have some when winter comes, but I have plenty. We could share."
00:09:33.833,00:09:37.917,"Sure. If you get the acorns out of the trees, I'll bury 'em."
00:09:38.000,00:09:40.167,Really? You'd do that?
00:09:40.250,00:09:43.250,"I mean, I'm not so great at digging."
00:09:43.333,00:09:47.595,"Of course! I'm a really good digger, but I could never get up in a tree!"
00:09:47.695,00:09:50.417,-We'll be the perfect team. -Yeah.
00:09:50.500,00:09:52.000,You know what?
00:09:52.083,00:09:59.458,"I want to make sure you have enough acorns for winter, so instead of acorn pie, I'm gonna make a cream cheese carrot cake!"
00:09:59.542,00:10:02.500,-You can have some if you want. -Yum!
00:10:02.583,00:10:04.438,I'd love that!
00:10:05.375,00:10:06.375,What's cake?
00:10:06.964,00:10:11.208,"Cake, well-- Cake is good."
00:10:11.292,00:10:13.051,Good? Really?
00:10:13.151,00:10:14.917,"Oh, I can't wait to try it."
00:10:15.000,00:10:19.792,"Hey, while Millie bakes the cake, what do you say we go find more acorns?"
00:10:19.875,00:10:21.000,"Yes, great idea."
00:10:21.083,00:10:22.083,Race you!
00:10:22.167,00:10:23.292,You're on!
00:10:23.375,00:10:26.083,Last one to the tree is a rotten acorn.
00:10:35.833,00:10:41.125,"Wait. Before you leave, smile, and say, Acorns!"
00:10:41.208,00:10:42.500,-Acorns! -Acorns!
00:10:46.646,00:10:49.482,I'm glad we figured out where Bean's acorns went.
00:10:49.566,00:10:53.820,"And even better, Bean made a friend who likes acorns as much as he does."
00:10:53.958,00:10:56.729,So what are you gonna do with the Fakecorn 5000?
00:10:59.500,00:11:00.958,I'm gonna keep it.
00:11:01.042,00:11:04.125,You never know when you're gonna need a giant acorn.
00:11:06.167,00:11:09.333,"Okay, time to close this case."
00:11:32.117,00:11:33.599,is officially closed.
00:11:45.917,00:11:49.000,"It was such a great idea to have an art show, Millie."
00:11:49.859,00:11:51.917,Thanks. It's gonna be great.
00:11:52.343,00:11:53.708,"What are you making, Millie?"
00:11:53.817,00:11:56.983,I'm going to weave an amazing basket.
00:11:57.298,00:12:02.125,I found a special spot in the forest where I collected the most perfect sticks ever.
00:12:04.577,00:12:09.792,"I just got my Harry Otter amazing wizard magic set, so my art project is going to be..."
00:12:09.875,00:12:12.073,the art of magic.
00:12:16.417,00:12:17.583,Huh? Oops.
00:12:17.667,00:12:19.292,Where'd my scarf go?
00:12:19.375,00:12:21.292,You dropped it on my sticks.
00:12:21.375,00:12:23.348,I hope they don't disappear.
00:12:23.473,00:12:25.245,I need them to make my basket.
00:12:25.345,00:12:27.473,Don't worry. Magic isn't really real.
00:12:27.548,00:12:30.041,I can only do the tricks that came with the magic set.
00:12:30.615,00:12:38.875,"But if I could do magic, I'd wave my wand over the scarf and say something like, Zoomi-day, zoomi-year, make the sticks all disappear."
00:12:41.375,00:12:43.125,-Wow! -Wow!
00:12:46.215,00:12:48.625,You did it! You did magic!
00:12:51.500,00:12:53.476,"That was a great trick, Jay."
00:12:53.826,00:12:58.208,"Now if you can just put them back, I'll start working on my basket."
00:12:58.292,00:13:00.250,"Uh, but it wasn't a trick."
00:13:00.333,00:13:02.542,They really did just disappear.
00:13:02.625,00:13:06.042,So? You can make them reappear. I know you can.
00:13:06.125,00:13:08.875,Okay. Let me give it a try.
00:13:08.958,00:13:13.083,"Zoomi-red, zoomi-black, make all Millie's sticks come back!"
00:13:14.358,00:13:16.485,"Oh, no. It didn't work."
00:13:16.585,00:13:19.779,"Millie, I'm so sorry. I made all your sticks disappear."
00:13:19.904,00:13:21.625,I don't know how to undo it.
00:13:21.708,00:13:24.542,"It's okay. It can't be your fault, Jay."
00:13:24.625,00:13:26.958,"Like you said, magic isn't real."
00:13:27.042,00:13:32.958,"Yeah, something else made those sticks disappear, and we're going to find out what."
00:13:33.042,00:13:34.788,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:13:35.292,00:13:36.875,Will you excuse us?
00:13:36.958,00:13:38.542,To the treehouse!
00:13:43.595,00:13:50.917,Millie needs those sticks to make her basket -for the art show. -And we need to prove to Jay that he didn't make her sticks disappear.
00:13:51.000,00:13:52.415,There's a lot at stake.
00:13:52.583,00:13:55.458,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:13:55.542,00:13:56.986,Let's do this.
00:14:27.167,00:14:31.561,"Zoomi-elbows, zoomi-knees, bring back the sticks! I'm asking, please!"
00:14:34.083,00:14:36.125,"I'm so sorry, Millie."
00:14:36.347,00:14:38.625,I really tried to get your sticks back.
00:14:38.708,00:14:41.375,"It's okay, Jay. I know you tried."
00:14:41.458,00:14:43.833,But your art opening is tomorrow.
00:14:43.917,00:14:45.904,What are we going to do?
00:14:46.604,00:14:50.542,What if we find new sticks just as good as the ones that disappeared?
00:14:50.625,00:14:52.292,I guess we could try.
00:14:52.375,00:14:53.750,That's a great idea.
00:14:54.183,00:14:56.665,Toby and I will stay here and look for clues.
00:14:56.750,00:14:57.958,-Yeah! -Let's go!
00:14:58.042,00:15:00.417,"Okay, great! Follow me!"
00:15:04.375,00:15:06.437,Now let's investigate.
00:15:08.500,00:15:11.417,Let's see. What do we know already?
00:15:11.500,00:15:14.626,"There was no wind, so Millie's sticks didn't blow away."
00:15:15.056,00:15:19.583,"And no footprints, so nobody snuck up here and took Millie's sticks."
00:15:20.794,00:15:22.458,It's kinda like magic!
00:15:22.542,00:15:29.654,"But we know magic is just make-believe, Magic tricks may look amazing, but there's always a secret that explains them."
00:15:30.471,00:15:36.936,"Well there's one stick that's still here, and it's the only clue we've got so far."
00:15:37.019,00:15:40.383,We need to show it to someone who knows a lot about sticks.
00:15:40.483,00:15:43.609,The killdeer! She uses sticks to make her nest.
00:15:43.750,00:15:45.042,Good thinking.
00:15:45.125,00:15:47.958,Maybe she can give us some clues to work with.
00:15:48.042,00:15:50.375,"Hey, aren't you gonna take the stick?"
00:15:53.000,00:15:55.417,I guess it fell out of my pocket.
00:15:55.500,00:15:56.750,Let's go.
00:15:58.708,00:16:00.460,Toby! Teri!
00:16:00.583,00:16:04.417,Let me guess. You need my help on a mystery.
00:16:04.500,00:16:07.708,What can I do for you? Find some lost trinket?
00:16:07.792,00:16:10.500,Maybe identify a mysterious noise?
00:16:10.583,00:16:12.917,"Actually, we're missing some sticks."
00:16:13.000,00:16:14.875,"Oh, sticks!"
00:16:17.659,00:16:19.805,Are these the ones you're missing?
00:16:21.167,00:16:22.792,Or what about these?
00:16:22.875,00:16:24.417,Or maybe it's these!
00:16:24.573,00:16:29.000,"Actually, we're looking for a certain pile of sticks that disappeared this morning."
00:16:29.083,00:16:30.710,They look just like this.
00:16:33.655,00:16:37.150,That's weird. I was sure I put that stick in my pocket.
00:16:37.250,00:16:38.375,Where'd it go?
00:16:43.750,00:16:46.368,-Is it this one? -Yeah.
00:16:46.493,00:16:49.458,-Does it look familiar to you? -Hmm.
00:16:49.542,00:16:51.958,"No, it doesn't look like any I have."
00:16:52.042,00:16:54.167,You said they disappeared this morning?
00:16:54.526,00:16:56.000,"Yes, this morning."
00:16:56.346,00:16:59.125,"Well, then it wasn't a bird that took your sticks."
00:16:59.208,00:17:02.833,"It's fall now, and most birds build their nests in the spring."
00:17:02.917,00:17:05.125,Thanks. That's very helpful.
00:17:05.208,00:17:09.373,Okay! Mystery solved! A bird didn't take your sticks.
00:17:09.698,00:17:12.184,"You need anything else, you let me know."
00:17:14.333,00:17:16.167,These are the best sticks ever.
00:17:16.250,00:17:18.417,"Now you can make your basket, right?"
00:17:18.500,00:17:21.067,"Definitely. Thanks, everyone."
00:17:21.217,00:17:24.377,I'm gonna run upstairs and get some glue so I can get started.
00:17:24.500,00:17:26.566,Will you guys watch the sticks for a second?
00:17:30.043,00:17:31.375,We're on it!
00:17:33.500,00:17:38.500,"Millie sounded super excited to make her giant basket, Oh, she did!"
00:17:40.792,00:17:42.875,can't find the other sticks in time?
00:17:42.958,00:17:45.500,Oh. I didn't think about that.
00:17:45.583,00:17:48.875,"Uh, what if you tried to make Millie even more sticks?"
00:17:48.958,00:17:50.500,"You know, with magic!"
00:17:50.583,00:17:54.083,I don't know. My magic hasn't worked well before.
00:17:54.167,00:18:00.208,"But she did seem really excited, and I haven't tried a magic trick to make more sticks."
00:18:00.292,00:18:01.542,"Okay, stand back!"
00:18:03.677,00:18:05.500,More sticks coming up!
00:18:05.583,00:18:09.973,"Zoomi-doodle, zoomi-nix, let's give Millie lots more sticks!"
00:18:13.958,00:18:15.875,"Ah, phooey."
00:18:16.494,00:18:18.568,Maybe Toby and Teri are right.
00:18:18.968,00:18:21.109,Magic's just make-believe.
00:18:23.208,00:18:25.313,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
00:18:25.396,00:18:27.797,Whoa! They're walking!
00:18:28.156,00:18:30.105,It's magic.
00:18:37.083,00:18:40.375,This is awful! Now Millie can't make a basket at all!
00:18:40.458,00:18:42.542,"Oh, I really messed up this time!"
00:18:42.625,00:18:45.000,No more magic ever!
00:18:48.167,00:18:50.708,Hey! Where's Jay?
00:18:51.115,00:18:52.750,He's hiding in the tree.
00:18:52.833,00:18:58.958,"Yeah, so he doesn't do any more magic, you know, by mistake."
00:18:59.042,00:19:03.625,I tried to make more sticks and just made Millie's new sticks disappear.
00:19:03.708,00:19:05.125,I'm done with magic.
00:19:05.546,00:19:08.236,"It wasn't magic, because magic isn't real."
00:19:08.361,00:19:10.500,There has to be something else going on here.
00:19:10.583,00:19:16.125,"But it had to be magic. Jay waved his wand, and the sticks got up and walked away."
00:19:17.750,00:19:20.242,Yeah! Like this.
00:19:21.249,00:19:23.083,Toby's got one of the sticks.
00:19:23.167,00:19:25.292,It keeps falling out of his pocket.
00:19:25.729,00:19:27.928,Maybe we should take a closer look at it.
00:19:28.053,00:19:28.937,Okay.
00:19:35.260,00:19:37.167,"Hey, this isn't a stick."
00:19:37.250,00:19:38.458,It's a bug.
00:19:39.875,00:19:42.292,That explains why your sticks walked away.
00:19:42.375,00:19:44.042,They weren't sticks at all!
00:19:44.125,00:19:45.958,They're bugs that look like sticks.
00:19:46.042,00:19:47.520,-Wow! -Is it moving?
00:19:47.620,00:19:48.642,-Really? -Amazing.
00:19:48.750,00:19:50.000,-Let me see! -Wow.
00:19:50.083,00:19:51.500,He's a stick-bug.
00:19:51.688,00:19:55.500,They're insects that keep themselves hidden by looking just like sticks.
00:19:55.583,00:19:58.583,So the sticks I collected were really bugs?
00:19:58.667,00:20:01.875,"Yup! And when they disappeared, it wasn't magic."
00:20:01.958,00:20:03.738,They just walked away.
00:20:10.033,00:20:11.583,-Nice to meet you! -Hi!
00:20:11.867,00:20:14.211,So I didn't make your sticks disappear!
00:20:14.336,00:20:18.042,"Yay! Now I can do magic again, because we know it's not real."
00:20:18.125,00:20:21.250,I don't wanna make things really disappear ever!
00:20:21.333,00:20:28.417,"But, how am I ever gonna collect the sticks I need to make a basket for the art show if I can't tell sticks from stick-bugs?"
00:20:28.500,00:20:31.448,Maybe you can get some help from a real expert.
00:20:33.167,00:20:34.417,What do you say?
00:20:34.500,00:20:36.583,Wanna help Millie find some real sticks?
00:20:38.250,00:20:41.042,Thanks! Let's go get a bunch.
00:20:41.125,00:20:43.792,I'm gonna make the best basket ever!
00:20:47.833,00:20:55.042,"Welcome to the Acorn Springs Gallery, home to some great art, all made by my friends."
00:20:55.125,00:21:18.542,"We have Toby's exquisite papier-mâché balloon sculpture and Teri's masterpiece of our treehouse, Bean's beautiful and amazing Rainbows Rock, Rumy's daring and very modern Pig Descending a Staircase, and Jay's performance piece, The Art of Magic."
00:21:19.667,00:21:23.042,"Behold, an ordinary blank canvas?"
00:21:23.125,00:21:25.958,Watch what happens when I wave my scarf.
00:21:26.324,00:21:27.208,-Oh. -Wow.
00:21:27.292,00:21:29.583,"Picture frame, let's take a chance."
00:21:29.667,00:21:31.958,"Feel the magic, and start to dance!"
00:21:43.667,00:21:45.083,That's great!
00:21:45.167,00:21:46.708,-Yay! -Cool!
00:21:47.098,00:21:48.042,Yeah!
00:21:48.125,00:21:49.417,Way great!
00:21:51.125,00:21:54.021,"Everyone say, Stick-bugs!"
00:21:54.125,00:21:55.667,-Stick-bugs! -Stick-bugs!
00:21:59.417,00:22:04.573,I'm sure glad we figured out what happened to Millie's sticks and were able to find her more.
00:22:04.750,00:22:08.333,Yeah! Those stick-bugs made it the best art show ever.
00:22:08.417,00:22:10.315,Time to close this case!
00:22:33.458,00:22:35.052,is officially closed.
00:00:33.659,00:00:48.799,"LITTLE DETECTIVES TOBY &amp; TERI Eh, oops."
00:00:48.882,00:00:50.133,Huh?
00:00:50.217,00:00:51.218,Hey!
00:00:53.136,00:00:54.805,Hello.
00:00:56.557,00:01:00.686,"Don't be scared. If you'd like the apple, you're welcome to it."
00:01:01.687,00:01:03.814,Come on. It's all right.
00:01:12.364,00:01:13.949,My name's Lucille.
00:01:14.074,00:01:16.994,I'm Millie. Here.
00:01:18.036,00:01:19.246,"Thank you, Millie."
00:01:19.329,00:01:21.290,I-I'm collecting snacks.
00:01:21.373,00:01:25.627,I wanted to do it all by myself. And my mom and dad said I could.
00:01:25.711,00:01:28.046,It looks like you're doing great.
00:01:28.130,00:01:30.382,Are the apples for something special?
00:01:30.465,00:01:33.468,Yeah! It's for our sleepover in Dreamy Grove.
00:01:33.552,00:01:39.641,"That's where we go every year to sleep for the whole winter, my mom, my dad, and all our friends!"
00:01:39.725,00:01:41.852,"Oh, that sounds like fun."
00:01:41.935,00:01:47.065,"It is. Well, my mom and dad are waiting for me there, so I better get going."
00:01:47.190,00:01:50.485,Of course. You don't want them to worry.
00:01:50.569,00:01:52.362,"It was nice meeting you, Lucille."
00:01:52.446,00:01:55.657,"Nice meeting you too, Millie. Bye!"
00:01:59.953,00:02:02.914,"Uh, bye again. Have a great winter."
00:02:02.998,00:02:04.958,"You, too, Lucille."
00:02:07.919,00:02:16.219,"Um, Millie, I told my parents I knew the way to Dreamy Grove, because I thought I did, but now I can't remember."
00:02:16.345,00:02:18.972,"Oh, no! Are you lost?"
00:02:19.056,00:02:22.142,I think so. What am I gonna do?
00:02:22.225,00:02:25.228,I promised my parents I'd be there in an hour.
00:02:25.312,00:02:28.565,"If I'm not there on time, they're going to worry!"
00:02:29.858,00:02:32.277,Hmm. Hop in my basket.
00:02:32.361,00:02:36.657,I know someone who can help you find Dreamy Grove and your mom and dad!
00:02:36.740,00:02:37.991,Really?
00:02:38.116,00:02:41.453,Sure. It's what detectives do.
00:02:45.582,00:02:46.750,"Hey, guys."
00:02:49.252,00:02:52.839,Yum! Are those cheese sandwiches?
00:02:52.923,00:02:54.716,Yeah. Would you like a bite?
00:02:58.095,00:03:00.222,Your friend turned into a ball!
00:03:00.347,00:03:01.682,It's all right.
00:03:01.765,00:03:05.268,"Guys, this is my new friend, Lucille."
00:03:05.394,00:03:07.354,"-Hey! -Hi, Lucille."
00:03:07.479,00:03:08.689,"Go ahead, Lucille."
00:03:08.772,00:03:11.441,Just tell Toby and Teri what's wrong.
00:03:12.901,00:03:16.863,I'm supposed to meet my mom and dad in a place called Dreamy Grove.
00:03:16.947,00:03:20.242,Lucille told them she'd meet them there in one hour.
00:03:20.325,00:03:23.245,"Hmm, never heard of Dreamy Grove."
00:03:23.370,00:03:25.330,It's where we sleep for the winter.
00:03:25.497,00:03:28.417,You sleep all winter?
00:03:28.500,00:03:32.421,Wow! you must have the world's longest dreams.
00:03:32.546,00:03:36.341,We wake up now and then. That's why we need the apples.
00:03:36.425,00:03:40.220,"If we wake up and it's snowy, we'll need snacks."
00:03:40.303,00:03:43.598,"I thought I knew the way, but I guess I don't."
00:03:43.682,00:03:47.185,You think you guys can help Lucille find her way to Dreamy Grove?
00:03:48.145,00:03:49.604,Of course we can.
00:03:49.688,00:03:51.815,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:03:51.898,00:03:53.567,Will you excuse us?
00:03:53.650,00:03:55.527,To the treehouse!
00:04:03.452,00:04:05.287,or her parents are gonna worry.
00:04:05.370,00:04:09.708,And they need the apples if they're going to have snacks to sleep through the whole winter.
00:04:09.791,00:04:11.543,There's a lot at stake.
00:04:11.626,00:04:15.046,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:04:15.130,00:04:17.424,Let's do this!
00:04:48.538,00:04:51.208,So this is where I found Lucille.
00:04:51.291,00:04:58.006,"So if you go to Dreamy Grove every year, we just have to help you remember which way to go."
00:05:05.055,00:05:06.932,But there are two trails.
00:05:07.015,00:05:08.767,Which one do we take?
00:05:11.061,00:05:12.062,Uh...
00:05:13.980,00:05:17.359,Wow. Lucille did that ball thing again.
00:05:19.194,00:05:20.821,What's wrong?
00:05:21.905,00:05:27.619,"I don't see very well, and I have short legs, so I don't like going downhill."
00:05:27.702,00:05:29.496,It's hard for hedgehogs.
00:05:29.579,00:05:31.498,But I'm okay going uphill.
00:05:31.623,00:05:40.257,"So if we follow the facts, it means Lucille's mom and dad didn't go this way either, which means Dreamy Grove has to be that way."
00:05:40.340,00:05:41.675,Come on!
00:05:46.721,00:05:48.515,Look at all the apple cores.
00:05:48.598,00:05:50.225,Someone must really love apples.
00:05:52.477,00:05:55.313,it might have been your mom and dad?
00:05:55.438,00:06:00.402,"Apples are my mom and dad's favorite, And we all eat a bunch before we go to sleep."
00:06:00.485,00:06:03.363,You guys are amazing! Thanks!
00:06:03.446,00:06:05.699,It's what detectives do.
00:06:15.792,00:06:18.962,"Wow, how are you making footprints in places you haven't been yet?"
00:06:19.087,00:06:22.966,I dunno. This is what I always do when I go to Dreamy Grove.
00:06:23.049,00:06:25.051,I follow my mom and dad's footprints.
00:06:28.054,00:06:29.431,What do you know?
00:06:29.514,00:06:32.559,These footprints match Lucille's.
00:06:32.642,00:06:34.936,So they probably are her mom and dad's.
00:06:35.186,00:06:38.273,"Nice detective work, Jay. Come on!"
00:06:39.900,00:06:42.736,The footprints lead onto these rocks.
00:06:44.571,00:06:46.990,You mean we have to climb out there?
00:06:47.073,00:06:50.994,"I mean, I don't. I can fly. But, are you sure it's this way?"
00:06:51.119,00:06:53.246,If we use the clues...
00:06:53.330,00:06:55.790,and follow the apple cores...
00:06:55.874,00:06:57.959,this is the way they went.
00:07:00.795,00:07:04.841,"Oh, I remember this part. It's kinda scary."
00:07:04.925,00:07:06.426,We'll do it together.
00:07:06.509,00:07:09.888,Things aren't so scary when you do them together.
00:07:09.971,00:07:11.848,Climb in. I'll carry you.
00:07:18.438,00:07:22.400,"Okay, everybody follow me, and be careful."
00:07:34.871,00:07:36.247,Hold on tight.
00:07:36.331,00:07:38.333,We're almost there.
00:07:39.793,00:07:41.628,Oof!
00:07:41.753,00:07:43.588,Wait. Hold on.
00:07:43.672,00:07:45.090,Oops! Oh!
00:07:47.300,00:07:50.178,"Oh, no. Where did my glasses go?"
00:07:50.261,00:07:53.890,"They're right below you, but they're in a tiny, little crevice."
00:07:53.974,00:07:57.644,I don't think any of us can fit there.
00:07:57.727,00:07:59.312,What am I gonna do?
00:07:59.396,00:08:01.856,I can't see without my glasses.
00:08:04.150,00:08:05.610,I'll get 'em.
00:08:05.694,00:08:06.736,Huh?
00:08:08.154,00:08:09.823,Aren't you scared?
00:08:09.906,00:08:12.701,"A little, but I know I can do it."
00:08:14.411,00:08:16.246,Here goes!
00:08:40.812,00:08:42.188,Here we go!
00:09:01.958,00:09:03.460,Yeah!
00:09:03.543,00:09:06.671,-Yeah! -Yippee!
00:09:06.755,00:09:10.008,"Oh, I'm so glad I've got these back."
00:09:10.091,00:09:11.718,"Thanks, Lucille."
00:09:11.801,00:09:14.095,That was really brave.
00:09:14.179,00:09:15.722,Wow! Really?
00:09:15.805,00:09:17.599,I guess I was brave.
00:09:17.682,00:09:19.809,You're the most fearless hedgehog I've ever met.
00:09:19.893,00:09:22.312,But you're also the only hedgehog I've ever met.
00:09:22.395,00:09:23.855,But that was still amazing!
00:09:24.689,00:09:25.815,Thanks!
00:09:25.899,00:09:27.776,So where do we go from here?
00:09:27.901,00:09:29.819,"Ah, this part, I remember."
00:09:33.948,00:09:35.075,Come on!
00:09:38.787,00:09:40.955,"Ah, this is it!"
00:09:41.039,00:09:44.334,"Everyone, this is Dreamy Grove."
00:09:48.963,00:09:49.881,I see her.
00:09:49.964,00:09:52.092,She's right over there!
00:10:06.314,00:10:08.483,"Lucille, there you are!"
00:10:09.859,00:10:12.195,We were starting to worry.
00:10:12.278,00:10:16.032,"Mom, Dad, this is Millie and her friends."
00:10:16.157,00:10:17.742,They helped me find you.
00:10:17.826,00:10:20.161,We had a pretty big adventure.
00:10:20.245,00:10:23.081,Lucille's a very brave little hedgehog.
00:10:23.164,00:10:25.708,You're going to have to tell us all about it.
00:10:25.792,00:10:28.294,It was really fun!
00:10:28.378,00:10:31.214,But I forgot to bring back snacks.
00:10:31.297,00:10:34.676,Or maybe you've got some right here.
00:10:38.346,00:10:40.765,"Ah, thanks, Millie."
00:10:40.849,00:10:43.643,You're the best friend a hedgehog could have.
00:10:47.522,00:10:51.568,"Everyone say, Sweet dreams."
00:10:51.651,00:10:53.611,-Sweet Dreams! -Sweet Dreams!
00:10:56.865,00:11:00.660,"So when we used the clues, we were able to find Dreamy Grove."
00:11:00.743,00:11:03.705,And help Lucille get back to her mom and dad.
00:11:03.788,00:11:07.000,Now they can sleep peacefully all the way 'til spring.
00:11:07.083,00:11:09.335,Time to close this case.
00:11:32.066,00:11:33.943,is officially closed.
00:11:48.166,00:11:50.710,"-Mm-hmm. -Nice throw, Bean."
00:11:52.503,00:11:54.923,I love skipping stones.
00:11:55.006,00:11:57.717,"Okay, Rumy, it's your turn!"
00:11:57.800,00:11:59.302,Show 'em how it's done!
00:11:59.385,00:12:01.054,Okay.
00:12:01.137,00:12:03.514,Here goes!
00:12:06.434,00:12:08.186,"-Yay, Rumy! -Yeah! Yeah!"
00:12:09.229,00:12:10.563,"Hey, anybody thirsty?"
00:12:10.647,00:12:12.982,There's fresh lemonade back at the treehouse.
00:12:13.066,00:12:14.067,Who wants some?
00:12:14.192,00:12:15.944,-I do! I do! -Me! Me!
00:12:16.027,00:12:19.989,I think I'm gonna stay here and keep skipping stones if that's okay.
00:12:20.114,00:12:21.866,"Oh, I'll stay here with Rumy."
00:12:21.950,00:12:25.787,"I like watching the stones go skip, skip, skip across the water."
00:12:25.912,00:12:28.539,Sounds good. You guys have fun.
00:12:31.125,00:12:33.836,"Hey, let's find some really good rocks."
00:12:33.920,00:12:38.049,"Okay! And while you do that, I'm going to have a snack."
00:12:43.721,00:12:45.473,This one's perfect.
00:12:46.849,00:12:49.602,"Moose, watch me set a new record!"
00:12:55.108,00:12:57.485,Yahoo! Yippee!
00:12:58.653,00:13:00.196,Huh?
00:13:09.706,00:13:11.165,A pond monster?
00:13:11.249,00:13:14.252,What exactly is a pond monster?
00:13:14.335,00:13:16.796,He's a monster in the pond!
00:13:16.879,00:13:19.799,"I just skipped a stone, and he appeared!"
00:13:19.882,00:13:21.968,You must've hit him with the rock.
00:13:22.051,00:13:24.470,"Ooh, I bet that made him mad. Oh, no!"
00:13:24.554,00:13:27.974,-You made a pond monster mad! -He was mad!
00:13:28.057,00:13:30.101,He made a terrible sound.
00:13:30.184,00:13:31.978,"Oh, it was awful!"
00:13:32.061,00:13:34.814,He was just so slimy and scary.
00:13:34.897,00:13:37.942,I totally want to see a pond monster.
00:13:38.067,00:13:41.154,"Oh, no, you don't!"
00:13:41.237,00:13:45.074,"Okay, first, there's no such thing as monsters."
00:13:45.158,00:13:47.201,I don't know. Then what did Rumy see?
00:13:47.285,00:13:49.245,"What else is green, goes, Whaah!"
00:13:49.329,00:13:52.332,and lives in the pond? What else could that be?
00:13:52.415,00:13:55.501,That's what we're going to figure out. We promise.
00:13:55.585,00:13:57.670,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:13:57.795,00:13:59.297,Will you excuse us?
00:13:59.380,00:14:01.257,To the treehouse!
00:14:08.931,00:14:11.559,but now he's afraid to go there because of what he saw.
00:14:12.185,00:14:13.811,But we know monsters aren't real.
00:14:13.895,00:14:16.481,Se we gotta figure out what that thing really was.
00:14:16.564,00:14:18.066,There's a lot at stake.
00:14:18.191,00:14:21.361,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:14:21.444,00:14:23.196,Let's do this.
00:14:53.643,00:15:01.025,"He was really big, with floppy ears like lily pads, and his head was as big as two thimbleberry bushes."
00:15:02.527,00:15:06.948,Mm-hmm. I think I've got it.
00:15:07.031,00:15:08.282,How's this?
00:15:09.742,00:15:11.702,Ahh! That's him!
00:15:14.622,00:15:16.749,"It's all right, Rumy."
00:15:17.417,00:15:19.544,Millie drew a picture of Rumy's pond monster.
00:15:19.669,00:15:22.630,I thought it might help you guys with your investigation.
00:15:22.713,00:15:24.882,"It totally will. Thanks, Millie."
00:15:27.468,00:15:30.680,"Was there anything else, anything that's not in the picture?"
00:15:30.763,00:15:34.392,Yeah! He made this terrible sound.
00:15:34.475,00:15:39.439,"When the pond monster rose up out of the murky depths, he went..."
00:15:41.065,00:15:42.567,That's him!
00:15:42.650,00:15:46.154,Yay! I'm gonna see a pond monster!
00:15:46.237,00:15:48.406,Come on! Let's go!
00:15:49.657,00:15:51.284,No! Let's not go!
00:15:51.367,00:15:53.119,Let's stay here!
00:15:53.202,00:15:55.705,Whoa. Now I'm all by myself.
00:15:55.788,00:15:58.416,Guys? Wait up!
00:16:02.879,00:16:05.590,"Hi, guys! Are we going back to the pond?"
00:16:05.715,00:16:08.843,"No. Rumy just saw a monster at the pond, a pond monster."
00:16:08.926,00:16:10.261,And we all just heard it.
00:16:10.386,00:16:11.846,"It went, Ahh!"
00:16:11.929,00:16:15.975,"Uh, it was deeper, more like, Uhh!"
00:16:17.685,00:16:21.606,I make a sound like that when I step on a pointy rock.
00:16:21.689,00:16:23.191,I've got sensitive feet.
00:16:23.274,00:16:26.277,But I don't think I've ever seen a pond monster.
00:16:26.360,00:16:27.361,Was it scary?
00:16:27.445,00:16:30.740,"Oh, yeah! Millie drew a picture."
00:16:32.783,00:16:35.161,"Wow, he does look scary."
00:16:35.244,00:16:36.496,Look familiar at all?
00:16:36.579,00:16:40.249,"No, but he looks like he's made of lily pads."
00:16:40.333,00:16:44.295,"Huh. You're right, and the pond is full of lily pads."
00:16:44.378,00:16:47.465,I say we follow the facts back to the pond.
00:16:48.257,00:16:50.259,Look at all the lily pads.
00:16:50.384,00:16:53.346,I know. They're really yummy.
00:16:53.429,00:16:59.519,"Oh, and the roots are even better, but you have to dive all the way to the bottom of the pond to get them."
00:16:59.602,00:17:03.856,"Roots at bottom, super yummy."
00:17:03.940,00:17:05.441,You dive underwater?
00:17:05.525,00:17:08.027,"To get the roots, yeah!"
00:17:12.573,00:17:17.828,"There are always lily pads in the pond, but look! There's a bunch on the trail!"
00:17:20.998,00:17:25.670,"Interesting. How did they get here, all the way from the pond?"
00:17:28.756,00:17:30.216,"There's mud, too."
00:17:31.592,00:17:34.303,It looks like our pond monster went this way.
00:17:34.387,00:17:35.388,Come on!
00:17:36.472,00:17:40.726,"If the pond monster went that way, I think I'd like to stay here."
00:17:40.810,00:17:44.105,Will you stay with me? I'd feel better if you stayed.
00:17:44.230,00:17:47.233,Of course. We can keep each other safe.
00:17:47.316,00:17:51.737,"As long as you're here to protect me, I'm not so scared."
00:17:51.821,00:17:54.574,"Hey, we could even skip some stones!"
00:17:54.657,00:17:55.825,Sure!
00:17:55.950,00:18:00.246,Okay. We'll be back with answers.
00:18:07.587,00:18:10.131,There's a lily pad up here. Look!
00:18:12.258,00:18:13.968,How'd it get up there?
00:18:14.051,00:18:17.096,Remember? Rumy said the pond monster was gigantic!
00:18:17.179,00:18:22.643,"What if every time our pond monster brushed against one of these trees, he left a lily pad?"
00:18:22.768,00:18:25.354,Which means he's not made of lily pads.
00:18:25.438,00:18:26.897,He's wearing them.
00:18:27.023,00:18:28.232,Wearing lily pads?
00:18:28.316,00:18:30.401,But why would someone wear lily pads?
00:18:30.484,00:18:33.070,"Well, you might not do it on purpose."
00:18:33.154,00:18:40.745,"If you were a big, scary monster and you rose up out of the pond, you might end up covered in lily pads."
00:18:40.828,00:18:46.250,"But if the pond monster lives in the pond, how come the moose has never, ever seen him?"
00:18:46.334,00:18:50.004,I think we'd better head back and ask some more questions.
00:18:52.131,00:18:58.846,"Oh, I'm afraid we skipped so many stones that all the best ones are at the bottom of the pond."
00:18:58.929,00:19:01.932,You're right. I'll go in the water and get them!
00:19:02.016,00:19:07.480,"I do it all the time. You just stay right here, and I'll go get us some rocks."
00:19:07.563,00:19:09.774,"Well, aren't you afraid of the pond monster?"
00:19:09.899,00:19:13.194,What if you make him mad and he comes running out again?
00:19:13.277,00:19:15.613,Don't worry. I'll protect you.
00:19:15.696,00:19:18.574,"You wait here, and I'll be right back."
00:19:30.961,00:19:36.258,"Hey, you know, if Moose isn't scared, maybe I shouldn't be either."
00:19:43.057,00:19:46.143,Ohh! I totally take that back!
00:19:49.480,00:19:52.233,I found some great skipping stones.
00:19:52.358,00:19:55.236,Ahh! Pond monster!
00:19:56.445,00:19:58.823,Ahh! Pond monster!
00:19:58.948,00:20:01.492,Run! It's the pond monster!
00:20:01.575,00:20:05.162,"He's back, and he knows my name!"
00:20:06.580,00:20:09.709,Wait. The pond monster knows my name?
00:20:09.834,00:20:12.920,"Everybody, run! The pond monster's coming!"
00:20:13.003,00:20:15.756,It's okay! There isn't a pond monster.
00:20:17.341,00:20:19.927,"I mean, there is, but it's just you."
00:20:20.010,00:20:21.011,"Who, me?"
00:20:21.095,00:20:23.139,Wait. What?
00:20:29.478,00:20:32.189,"Wow, I am a little scary-looking."
00:20:32.273,00:20:34.358,But how did I get so dirty?
00:20:34.442,00:20:39.071,"When you come up from the bottom of the pond, you end up covered in mud and lily pads."
00:20:39.155,00:20:45.661,"It's pretty amazing. According to the WhyTab, you can close your nose and stay underwater for a really long time."
00:20:45.786,00:20:49.665,I sure can! I just didn't know I looked so scary.
00:20:49.749,00:20:51.667,Haven't you ever seen yourself?
00:20:51.751,00:20:55.546,"I don't own a mirror, but I think I should get one."
00:21:00.760,00:21:02.094,Oops. Sorry.
00:21:02.178,00:21:06.223,"And I'm especially sorry I scared you, Rumy."
00:21:06.348,00:21:08.642,"Oh, it's okay."
00:21:10.269,00:21:15.900,"Now that I know there's no such thing as a pond monster, I'm not scared at all."
00:21:16.984,00:21:19.111,Hmm. Oh.
00:21:23.908,00:21:25.201,Blahh!
00:21:27.661,00:21:31.123,"Ooh, sorry, Rumy. It's just me."
00:21:33.042,00:21:37.421,I knew that. I wasn't really scared.
00:21:40.174,00:21:42.468,Let's go skip some stones!
00:21:42.551,00:21:44.011,-Yay! -Awesome!
00:21:44.094,00:21:49.141,"Wait! Everybody smile, and say, Pond monster!"
00:21:49.266,00:21:51.685,-Pond monster! -Pond monster!
00:21:55.856,00:21:58.776,You never think of a moose being able to go underwater.
00:21:58.901,00:22:03.948,"But if you're a moose, that's where the yummiest food is, even if it's a little messy."
00:22:04.073,00:22:06.784,"Messy, yes. But scary?"
00:22:06.867,00:22:10.454,Not anymore! Time to close this case.
00:22:32.852,00:22:34.562,is officially closed.
00:00:33.659,00:00:52.177,LITTLE DETECTIVES TOBY &amp; TERI I-I'm sorry about that.
00:00:52.261,00:00:53.470,I didn't see you.
00:00:53.554,00:00:55.055,Here. Let me help.
00:00:56.890,00:00:58.183,Thanks.
00:00:58.308,00:01:01.270,"You're welcome. I'm Jay. By the way, what's your name?"
00:01:01.353,00:01:04.731,"Oh, I'm Wayne. Wayne the crane."
00:01:04.815,00:01:06.900,"Well, nice to meet you, Wayne the crane."
00:01:06.984,00:01:09.194,"-Nice to meet you, too. -Listen."
00:01:09.278,00:01:11.738,I'm on the way to meet my friends for some hot cocoa.
00:01:11.863,00:01:14.324,"If you're not doing anything right now, you wanna come?"
00:01:14.575,00:01:16.577,"Oh, I don't know."
00:01:16.660,00:01:18.495,"Oh, come on. It'll be fun."
00:01:18.579,00:01:21.373,Okay. It does sound nice.
00:01:24.251,00:01:27.254,"Oh, we should ask your friends to come with us, too."
00:01:29.214,00:01:31.633,Wait! Don't! They're not my friends.
00:01:31.717,00:01:36.013,"Uh, I mean, I wish they were, but I'm no good at making friends."
00:01:36.096,00:01:37.598,I don't know how to.
00:01:38.599,00:01:39.808,Of course you do.
00:01:39.891,00:01:42.102,-You made friends with me. -I did?
00:01:42.185,00:01:47.983,"I mean, well, do you think those cranes would be my friend if I bumped into them like I bumped into you?"
00:01:48.066,00:01:49.901,Only one way to find out.
00:01:49.985,00:01:51.903,Come on. I'll come with you.
00:01:51.987,00:01:54.406,Here comes the friendship bump!
00:02:00.954,00:02:03.582,Huh. That was a surprising reaction.
00:02:03.665,00:02:07.544,"No, it's not. It happens to me all the time."
00:02:07.628,00:02:10.047,I just don't know how to make friends.
00:02:10.130,00:02:13.383,"You know, I think you need to meet my friends Toby and Teri."
00:02:13.508,00:02:15.218,They're really really good at helping.
00:02:15.302,00:02:17.179,They'll figure it out. I promise.
00:02:17.262,00:02:20.641,-What do you think? -I think that would be amazing.
00:02:25.354,00:02:28.690,Mmm. I love hot cocoa on a cool day.
00:02:28.774,00:02:32.110,"Hey, guys! I want to introduce you to someone!"
00:02:33.737,00:02:35.739,This is my friend Wayne.
00:02:37.866,00:02:39.993,Is he make-believe?
00:02:40.077,00:02:42.788,"No, he's-- Hmm?"
00:02:42.871,00:02:44.873,Wait. Where'd he go?
00:02:47.959,00:02:51.004,"It's okay, Wayne. These are my friends."
00:02:51.088,00:02:54.549,Any friend of Jay's is a friend of ours.
00:02:54.633,00:02:56.551,"Nice to meet you, Wayne."
00:02:56.635,00:02:58.178,-Hi there. -Hello.
00:02:58.261,00:03:00.722,"Nice to meet you guys, too."
00:03:00.806,00:03:03.809,Wayne's got a little problem I thought you guys could help with.
00:03:03.892,00:03:09.231,"-Of course. Happy to help. -Some cranes moved into the meadow, and Wayne would like to be their friend."
00:03:09.314,00:03:12.067,But-- But I don't know how to make friends.
00:03:12.150,00:03:14.569,Making new friends can be hard to do.
00:03:14.653,00:03:16.154,But we'll help if you want.
00:03:16.238,00:03:18.657,Really? I-I think that'd be great.
00:03:18.740,00:03:19.741,Thank you.
00:03:19.825,00:03:22.077,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:03:22.160,00:03:23.495,Will you excuse us?
00:03:23.578,00:03:25.664,To the treehouse!
00:03:31.169,00:03:34.256,Wayne really wants to be friends with the other cranes.
00:03:34.423,00:03:38.301,So we have to figure out what Wayne needs to do to make new friends.
00:03:38.427,00:03:40.178,There's a lot at stake.
00:03:40.262,00:03:43.432,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:03:43.515,00:03:45.183,Let's do this!
00:04:16.423,00:04:17.758,"Hi, guys."
00:04:19.634,00:04:22.554,"Hey, Beatrice. This is our new friend Wayne."
00:04:22.679,00:04:25.599,Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
00:04:25.682,00:04:26.892,"Howdy, Wayne."
00:04:26.975,00:04:29.394,"I'm Beatrice, but you can call me Bea."
00:04:33.398,00:04:35.233,What are you doing with your tail?
00:04:35.317,00:04:38.528,"Oh, we beavers can talk with our tails."
00:04:38.612,00:04:41.573,"Right now, I'm asking you to be my friend."
00:04:41.656,00:04:44.534,Oh. I'd really like to be your friend.
00:04:44.618,00:04:46.912,Then slap your tail right back.
00:04:52.959,00:04:55.337,"Hey, this is kind of fun."
00:04:55.420,00:04:58.048,"You should slap your tail like that for the cranes, Wayne."
00:04:58.131,00:05:00.759,-I bet they'd love it. -Really? You think so?
00:05:00.842,00:05:04.346,Ho ho. You do look really friendly doing it.
00:05:04.429,00:05:05.889,"What do you think, Wayne?"
00:05:05.972,00:05:08.016,Wanna go up there and shake a tail feather?
00:05:08.099,00:05:10.977,"Yeah! Sure. Thanks, Bea."
00:05:11.061,00:05:13.522,"Happy to help. Good luck, Wayne."
00:05:22.906,00:05:25.450,Psst! Look over here.
00:05:37.838,00:05:39.464,Whoa!
00:05:46.888,00:05:48.932,I was sure that would work.
00:05:49.015,00:05:51.434,It worked for your beaver friend.
00:05:51.518,00:05:53.103,What do we do now?
00:05:53.186,00:05:55.063,We follow the facts.
00:05:55.146,00:05:56.898,We've made new friends before.
00:05:56.982,00:05:58.483,What else have we done?
00:05:58.567,00:06:01.069,Millie made friends with the mockingbird.
00:06:01.152,00:06:02.654,She sang a song.
00:06:02.737,00:06:05.824,"That's right. I started singing, and she joined in."
00:06:05.907,00:06:07.993,Now we sing all the time together.
00:06:10.871,00:06:14.583,I could sing a song about the wonderfulness of friendship.
00:06:16.501,00:06:18.879,a song about the wonderfulness of friendship.
00:06:18.962,00:06:21.715,You don't have to. We'll write you a song.
00:06:21.798,00:06:23.842,Yes! It'll be a piece of cake!
00:06:23.925,00:06:26.041,"Oh, we should definitely have cake in the song."
00:06:26.116,00:06:28.483,It's a fact. Friends love cake. Write that down.
00:06:28.766,00:06:34.311,"Yeah, and we'll say the word friends a lot, because a good song always repeats."
00:06:34.394,00:06:35.687,It'll go like...
00:06:43.028,00:06:45.447,"we'll have a great song for you to sing, Wayne."
00:06:45.530,00:06:47.949,Yeah. We got this.
00:06:50.702,00:06:52.621,"Okay, remember..."
00:07:03.590,00:07:09.262,"And you could add in, Friends love cake, -if you feel it works in the moment. -Okay. I got it."
00:07:27.447,00:07:29.616,Come back! You haven't heard the rest!
00:07:29.699,00:07:32.744,There's another 15 verses!
00:07:34.287,00:07:37.165,I give up. Nothing works.
00:07:37.248,00:07:40.043,I'll never make friends with those cranes.
00:07:40.126,00:07:43.254,There's gotta be a way to help Wayne.
00:07:43.338,00:07:46.424,"Well, me and Rumy made friends by sharing acorns."
00:07:46.508,00:07:48.843,Remember how I made friends with you guys?
00:07:52.472,00:07:55.475,"But by the time you got me out, we were friends."
00:07:55.558,00:07:57.310,And I was really dirty.
00:07:57.394,00:07:59.437,Maybe that's not such a good idea.
00:07:59.562,00:08:00.772,But it's a clue.
00:08:00.855,00:08:04.359,"We all have different stories, because we're all different."
00:08:04.442,00:08:09.739,And so is Wayne. He shouldn't be slapping his tail like a beaver or singing like Millie.
00:08:09.823,00:08:12.033,Wayne should be doing something he loves to do.
00:08:12.117,00:08:15.120,"But, how do we figure out what Wayne loves to do?"
00:08:15.203,00:08:16.871,That's an easy one.
00:08:16.955,00:08:18.999,We ask him. Come on.
00:08:33.179,00:08:36.307,Wow! You can really dance.
00:08:40.770,00:08:46.401,"You're amazing, Wayne. I knew you could bump, but this, wow! You were so-- Wow!"
00:08:46.484,00:08:49.320,Thanks. I really love to dance.
00:08:49.404,00:08:52.949,"It's kind of my special, secret, all my own thing."
00:08:53.033,00:08:57.829,"I bet if you shared your dance with those cranes, -they'd love it. -Really?"
00:08:57.954,00:09:03.835,"If you showed them who you really are, -they can't help but like you. -We'll even provide the music."
00:09:12.135,00:09:13.762,"Okay, everyone."
00:09:13.845,00:09:15.305,"A-one, a-two..."
00:09:15.388,00:09:17.640,"A-one, two, three, four."
00:09:36.451,00:09:38.828,"Hi. Can I dance, too?"
00:09:38.912,00:09:40.747,"Sure! I mean, yes."
00:09:40.830,00:09:41.956,Do you want to?
00:09:43.917,00:09:50.131,"I'm Jane. I love to dance, but I was always afraid to. I'm shy."
00:09:50.215,00:09:51.966,"Really? Me, too!"
00:09:52.050,00:09:54.552,"I mean, me, too."
00:09:54.636,00:09:56.846,I'm Wayne.
00:09:56.930,00:10:00.600,"Wayne, this is Duane and Lane."
00:10:00.683,00:10:04.354,"-Uh, do you mind if we join in? -I'd love that."
00:10:18.118,00:10:19.452,It's working!
00:10:19.536,00:10:22.914,The cranes are talking to Wayne and copying his dance moves.
00:10:33.133,00:10:34.384,Look at this.
00:10:34.467,00:10:41.099,It says here red-crowned cranes like Wayne get to know each other by copying each other's movements.
00:10:41.224,00:10:46.479,"Hey, everybody, come on over, and meet my new friends."
00:10:46.604,00:10:50.775,"Everyone say, Dance party!"
00:10:50.859,00:10:53.528,-Dance party! -Dance party!
00:10:56.447,00:11:01.286,"So to make friends, Wayne just needed to be himself, and do what he loved to do."
00:11:01.369,00:11:08.293,"When he showed the cranes who he was inside, it turned out they loved dancing just as much as he did, and he made some new friends."
00:11:08.376,00:11:10.128,Time to close this case.
00:11:32.567,00:11:34.277,is officially closed.
00:11:43.244,00:11:45.121,All clear. Is everything ready?
00:11:45.205,00:11:47.123,Rumy and I made a banner.
00:11:55.673,00:12:00.220,"Toby, can you take the balloons and the banner -and hide them in the treehouse? -You got it."
00:12:04.891,00:12:08.811,"Oh, Bean's going to have the best birthday party ever!"
00:12:08.895,00:12:14.400,"And the best part, it's a surprise party, which makes it even more fun, because, you know, it's a surprise."
00:12:14.484,00:12:18.780,"I guess that's why they call it a surprise party, even though that kinda gives it away."
00:12:21.908,00:12:23.576,fresh out of the oven.
00:12:25.370,00:12:27.789,Millie's famous nut-butter cupcakes!
00:12:27.872,00:12:31.376,"Ooh, they smell so good."
00:12:31.459,00:12:33.211,Wait. Where are the acorns?
00:12:33.294,00:12:35.630,Bean loves them when you put acorns on top.
00:12:35.755,00:12:37.840,"Uh, I still have to find some."
00:12:37.924,00:12:40.635,Acorns are really hard to find in the winter.
00:12:43.221,00:12:46.557,"You guys wouldn't be hiding anything, would you?"
00:12:50.353,00:12:57.610,"Maybe because you're possibly, maybe, putting together a birthday party for someone who might be having a birthday."
00:12:57.694,00:13:00.405,No. No one I know is having a birthday.
00:13:00.530,00:13:02.657,Me neither. Definitely no birthdays today.
00:13:04.200,00:13:06.452,"We don't know what you're talking about, Bean."
00:13:06.536,00:13:10.748,None of us know anyone who's having a birthday anytime soon.
00:13:13.334,00:13:14.836,Then what's on the table?
00:13:14.919,00:13:16.337,There's nothing on the table.
00:13:18.923,00:13:22.635,Oh. I-I guess you're right.
00:13:22.719,00:13:24.637,There is nothing on the table.
00:13:24.762,00:13:27.181,"Really? I, uh..."
00:13:28.933,00:13:30.893,"Uh, will you excuse us?"
00:13:31.978,00:13:33.855,What happened to the cupcakes?
00:13:33.938,00:13:36.566,"They were right there, and now they're gone."
00:13:36.649,00:13:38.985,"Don't worry, Millie. We'll find 'em."
00:13:40.069,00:13:41.070,Aww.
00:13:41.154,00:13:43.823,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:13:43.906,00:13:46.367,Will you excuse us?
00:13:53.499,00:13:55.835,Everyone knows it's Bean's birthday.
00:13:55.918,00:13:58.671,And they all know he loves nut-butter cupcakes.
00:13:58.755,00:13:59.964,So who would take them?
00:14:00.048,00:14:03.176,"That's what we've gotta find out, and fast."
00:14:03.259,00:14:06.429,Or Bean's surprise party isn't going to be much of a party.
00:14:06.554,00:14:08.431,There's a lot at stake.
00:14:08.514,00:14:11.351,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:14:11.434,00:14:13.186,Let's do this.
00:14:40.922,00:14:43.966,"Okay, I asked Bean to find me some beets."
00:14:44.050,00:14:47.345,"He doesn't like beets, so he knows they're not for his birthday."
00:14:47.804,00:14:52.934,"Great thinking, Millie. Now, we gotta find those cupcakes, or it's not gonna be much of a surprise party."
00:14:53.017,00:14:56.020,"It'll still be a surprise, but not a fun one."
00:14:56.104,00:14:58.981,Surprise! You've got no cupcakes!
00:14:59.982,00:15:01.943,Okay. What do we know?
00:15:02.026,00:15:07.573,"Uh, well, I know I'm sitting on something that's kind of sharp..."
00:15:07.657,00:15:09.450,and acorny.
00:15:09.534,00:15:10.868,It's an acorn.
00:15:10.952,00:15:12.203,It's a clue!
00:15:12.286,00:15:15.540,It looks like this acorn was tied to a piece of paper.
00:15:15.623,00:15:18.042,Probably a note from whoever took the cupcakes.
00:15:18.126,00:15:21.712,"If we find that note, we'll be able to find the cupcakes!"
00:15:24.507,00:15:26.342,It should be right here.
00:15:26.426,00:15:28.553,Or maybe on the bench?
00:15:28.636,00:15:30.555,O-Or under the table.
00:15:31.556,00:15:33.891,Hold on. I'm trying to read your pants.
00:15:35.351,00:15:37.895,"That's okay, Rumy. No harm done."
00:15:37.979,00:15:40.940,It's too smudged to read.
00:15:41.023,00:15:42.733,Except here at the bottom.
00:15:42.817,00:15:44.444,Someone signed their name.
00:15:44.527,00:15:54.245,"It's hard to read, but I think it says Rah-- No, Roc-- No."
00:15:54.328,00:15:55.788,-Rocco! -Rocco!
00:15:55.872,00:15:58.040,Why would Rocco take the cupcakes?
00:15:58.124,00:16:01.252,"I don't know, but we're gonna find out."
00:16:03.129,00:16:05.173,Rocco lives in these rocks.
00:16:05.256,00:16:07.425,Rocco! Are you home?
00:16:09.927,00:16:13.598,"But if he had left, there'd be footprints in the snow."
00:16:13.681,00:16:16.225,"No Rocco, and no footprints."
00:16:16.309,00:16:23.274,"This is a mystery. With no footprints to follow, -he's going to be hard to find. -Let's get you some help."
00:16:29.197,00:16:32.825,Treehouse Detectives aerial squadron reporting for duty!
00:16:32.909,00:16:40.124,"Birds have amazing eyesight, so if anyone's going to be able to find Rocco, it's you guys."
00:16:40.208,00:16:47.548,"Remember, we find Rocco, we find those cupcakes, so when you see him, use your headsets to tell us where he is."
00:16:47.632,00:16:48.674,Roger that.
00:16:48.758,00:16:50.009,We're on it.
00:16:50.092,00:16:53.095,I'll use stickers and a map to keep track of where you see him.
00:16:53.179,00:16:58.851,"Okay. Treehouse Detectives aerial squadron, Operation Save Bean's Birthday is a go!"
00:17:02.230,00:17:03.731,-Let's do this. -Good luck!
00:17:03.814,00:17:05.066,You can do it!
00:17:15.034,00:17:18.329,I see him next to the oak tree in Shady Glade.
00:17:18.412,00:17:20.456,So he's here.
00:17:21.541,00:17:24.418,"Gotcha. Okay, let's go."
00:17:25.461,00:17:26.712,"Wait, guys. He's gone."
00:17:36.222,00:17:38.599,I see him. He's at the stream.
00:17:38.683,00:17:40.351,Rocco moved again?
00:17:42.061,00:17:44.480,"Oh, he's fast."
00:17:54.991,00:18:00.413,Everyone keeps seeing him at different places at the same time. How can that be?
00:18:00.496,00:18:06.586,"So where is he, and how is he getting wherever he's going without any footprints?"
00:18:06.669,00:18:12.883,-So it's a dead end. -Which just means we have to go back to the beginning and follow the facts.
00:18:15.761,00:18:18.764,This is the first oak tree where Jay saw Rocco.
00:18:18.848,00:18:24.186,"But he was at all those other trees, too, and no one ever saw a single footprint."
00:18:26.522,00:18:29.150,Look. There's a hole in the snow.
00:18:29.233,00:18:31.444,It's a Rocco-sized tunnel.
00:18:31.527,00:18:33.362,But it's in the snow.
00:18:33.446,00:18:35.990,"Nobody would dig a tunnel in the snow, would they?"
00:18:36.073,00:18:37.742,"I mean, isn't it really, really cold?"
00:18:39.201,00:18:40.536,"No, it's not."
00:18:40.620,00:18:49.795,"On cold winter days, it's warmer down there than up here in Acorn Springs, so small animals like Rocco dig tunnels all through the snow."
00:18:49.879,00:18:54.550,But that means Rocco and the cupcakes could be anywhere.
00:18:54.634,00:19:06.937,"Maybe if we draw lines between all the places Rocco was seen, they all meet up in the same place, so that's where we'll find Rocco and our cupcakes."
00:19:11.984,00:19:13.903,This has to be the spot.
00:19:15.237,00:19:16.322,"Hey, Rocco."
00:19:17.365,00:19:19.367,"Toby, hi."
00:19:20.409,00:19:22.578,So what do you guys think?
00:19:22.662,00:19:25.581,You decorated the cupcakes with acorns.
00:19:25.665,00:19:30.086,"We know how much Bean loves acorns, and how hard it is to find them in the winter."
00:19:30.169,00:19:33.839,So we all picked out our best ones and brought them to Rocco.
00:19:33.923,00:19:35.591,Didn't you get my note?
00:19:35.675,00:19:41.681,It said that we wanted to do something nice for Bean and help Millie out since we have all these yummy acorns.
00:19:41.764,00:19:46.268,"Yeah, we got it, but I erased it on accident."
00:19:46.352,00:19:48.521,"Wow, erased it?"
00:19:48.604,00:19:49.855,H-How'd you find me?
00:19:49.939,00:19:52.274,It's what detectives do.
00:19:52.400,00:19:55.611,"Ah, you guys are good, real good."
00:19:55.695,00:19:57.113,Thanks for helping.
00:19:57.196,00:19:59.323,The cupcakes look great!
00:19:59.407,00:20:00.908,"Hey, I have an idea."
00:20:00.991,00:20:03.327,"There's a tunnel to the treehouse, right?"
00:20:03.411,00:20:05.496,Sure. There's a bunch of 'em.
00:20:05.579,00:20:10.459,Then let's turn this surprise party into a double surprise party!
00:20:10.543,00:20:12.795,"Ooh, our surprise is going to have a surprise."
00:20:12.878,00:20:15.631,Surprise! We got a surprise on a surprise!
00:20:23.723,00:20:26.892,"Now everyone remember, before Bean gets here, we gotta hide."
00:20:26.976,00:20:29.854,"Then when he does show up, we all say, Surprise!"
00:20:29.937,00:20:37.236,"Okay, now everyone practice with me. Surpri-- Hey, where'd everyone go?"
00:20:39.196,00:20:40.281,"Hey, Jay."
00:20:40.364,00:20:42.658,I got those beets Millie wanted.
00:20:44.201,00:20:46.203,"I mean, excuse me."
00:20:50.833,00:20:53.419,-Surprise! -Surprise!
00:20:58.340,00:20:59.967,You remembered!
00:21:00.050,00:21:02.803,I thought you guys had forgotten my birthday.
00:21:02.887,00:21:05.097,We'd never forget your birthday.
00:21:05.181,00:21:07.224,"Happy birthday, Bean."
00:21:07.308,00:21:08.851,And thanks for the beets.
00:21:08.934,00:21:12.563,Thanks for the party. I was really surprised.
00:21:12.688,00:21:16.817,"Well, how do you feel about double surprises?"
00:21:19.695,00:21:21.447,Of course you do.
00:21:21.530,00:21:22.698,Rocco!
00:21:26.285,00:21:28.120,-Surprise! -Surprise!
00:21:28.204,00:21:30.956,"-Happy birthday, Bean! -Happy birthday, Bean!"
00:21:31.040,00:21:34.710,Wow! My favorite cupcakes.
00:21:34.794,00:21:38.005,"Thank you. Thank you, everybody."
00:21:38.088,00:21:41.509,This is the best birthday ever.
00:21:42.968,00:21:46.263,"Everybody say, Surprise!"
00:21:46.347,00:21:48.307,-Surprise! -Surprise!
00:21:51.811,00:21:54.480,That was the best surprise party ever!
00:21:54.563,00:21:57.858,But it took some detective work to make it all work out.
00:21:57.942,00:22:01.946,Who knew that Rocco and the pikas had secret passages under the snow?
00:22:02.029,00:22:05.157,"But just like we always say, if you use the clues..."
00:22:05.241,00:22:07.660,They lead you to the cupcakes.
00:00:33.584,00:00:42.209,LITTLE DETECTIVES TOBY &amp; TERI I got it!
00:00:42.292,00:00:46.380,"Now get ready, because this one's gonna be super fast."
00:00:47.798,00:00:50.175,Yes! I got it!
00:00:50.259,00:00:54.346,"All right, this one is gonna go super far. Are you ready?"
00:00:54.513,00:00:57.391,I've never been more ready. Give it all you got.
00:00:57.516,00:00:59.518,You asked for it!
00:01:02.688,00:01:03.772,Yes!
00:01:05.023,00:01:07.776,Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!
00:01:13.657,00:01:14.700,"Oh, no!"
00:01:14.783,00:01:16.618,My glasses!
00:01:16.702,00:01:18.579,It's okay. I see 'em.
00:01:18.662,00:01:21.081,They're right next to a little brown fish.
00:01:25.127,00:01:26.420,Whoa!
00:01:28.046,00:01:30.757,"Millie, did you see that?"
00:01:30.841,00:01:36.513,"The little brown fish just went sploosh, and then, whoosh, it flew right through the air!"
00:01:36.638,00:01:39.308,W-Wait. What about my glasses?
00:01:39.391,00:01:41.393,It's okay. They're right...
00:01:43.520,00:01:46.773,"Millie, I think that flying fish just took your glasses."
00:01:46.857,00:01:49.651,"Bean, I really need my glasses."
00:01:49.735,00:01:56.074,"Without them, I can't see you unless I get really, really, really close, like this."
00:01:56.158,00:01:57.492,There you are.
00:01:57.576,00:02:00.954,We better go find Toby and Teri.
00:02:04.124,00:02:06.543,So you saw a flying fish?
00:02:06.627,00:02:07.961,"Yeah, right?"
00:02:08.045,00:02:09.588,I didn't see anything.
00:02:09.671,00:02:11.298,That's kinda the problem.
00:02:11.381,00:02:14.468,"Well, it was a fish, and it was flying!"
00:02:14.551,00:02:16.970,It sure sounds like a flying fish.
00:02:17.054,00:02:18.764,And it took Millie's glasses.
00:02:18.847,00:02:23.810,"Wow! Imagine, right here in Acorn Springs, a fish that flies and needs glasses."
00:02:23.894,00:02:26.355,I really need my glasses to see.
00:02:28.649,00:02:30.734,"We'll get you back your glasses, Millie."
00:02:30.817,00:02:31.902,That's a promise.
00:02:31.985,00:02:34.279,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:02:34.363,00:02:35.697,Will you excuse us?
00:02:35.781,00:02:37.866,To the treehouse!
00:02:44.915,00:02:47.084,Millie really needs her glasses.
00:02:47.167,00:02:49.211,She can't see well without them.
00:02:49.294,00:02:56.218,"So unless we find them, she won't be able to run and play, -or do any of the things she likes to do. -There's a lot at stake."
00:02:56.385,00:02:59.346,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:02:59.429,00:03:01.181,Let's do this.
00:03:32.129,00:03:38.009,"Then, whoosh, out came the flying fish, and when I looked back, Millie's glasses were gone."
00:03:38.093,00:03:42.639,Was there anyone else around who might have seen the flying fish take Millie's glasses?
00:03:42.723,00:03:44.516,I don't think so.
00:03:44.641,00:03:47.477,What about the duck? We should ask him!
00:03:47.561,00:03:50.188,"I'm not a duck, Millie! I'm Bean!"
00:03:50.313,00:03:53.859,You kinda do look like a duck if I squint real hard.
00:03:53.942,00:04:01.366,"Maybe I should stick with you until we find your glasses, you know, so I can let you know what's going on."
00:04:01.450,00:04:04.286,"Thanks, Rumy. I appreciate it."
00:04:07.080,00:04:10.167,"Hey, there's a little bird down by the water."
00:04:10.250,00:04:12.544,Maybe she saw something.
00:04:15.964,00:04:18.049,Hi! I'm Toby.
00:04:18.133,00:04:20.552,Do you mind if we ask some questions?
00:04:20.635,00:04:22.763,My sister and I are detectives.
00:04:24.765,00:04:26.475,I've never met real detectives.
00:04:26.558,00:04:28.518,"Wow, those are some amazing badges!"
00:04:28.602,00:04:31.313,I've never seen any like them before! I'm Dipsy.
00:04:31.438,00:04:34.274,"Hello, Dipsy. Nice to meet you."
00:04:34.357,00:04:38.779,I don't think I've ever met a bird that looks quite like you before.
00:04:38.862,00:04:40.989,Not just any bird. I'm an ouzel.
00:04:41.072,00:04:42.866,It's fun to say. Try it!
00:04:49.372,00:04:50.707,"Ouzel, ouzel, ouzel!"
00:04:50.791,00:04:53.251,"So tell me, what are you guys detecting?"
00:04:53.335,00:04:55.170,"Well, Bean saw a flying fish."
00:04:55.253,00:04:58.840,And we need to find him so we can ask him some questions.
00:04:58.924,00:05:02.636,"A flying fish? Wow, I've never seen a flying fish before!"
00:05:02.719,00:05:04.513,Hmm. Why are you looking for him?
00:05:04.805,00:05:07.599,He may have taken Millie's glasses.
00:05:08.725,00:05:12.395,Millie and I were playing when her glasses went plop into the creek right here.
00:05:12.479,00:05:13.897,I could see them on the bottom.
00:05:13.980,00:05:17.692,"Then, sploosh, out of nowhere, this fish came flying out of the water!"
00:05:17.776,00:05:25.700,"And when I looked back at Millie's glasses, So that has to mean the flying fish took them, right?"
00:05:25.784,00:05:27.494,Or your glasses went downstream.
00:05:27.577,00:05:30.288,See how the creek moves really fast through here?
00:05:30.372,00:05:33.083,Anything that falls in here ends up down there.
00:05:33.166,00:05:34.876,Down where?
00:05:34.960,00:05:36.503,Down there!
00:05:39.214,00:05:40.882,"Do you know where, exactly?"
00:05:40.966,00:05:44.255,Just go straight downstream until you get to the bottom of the fast part.
00:05:44.330,00:05:45.929,It gets really swirly.
00:05:48.598,00:05:50.517,"When you see the blue rocks, turn left."
00:05:50.600,00:05:52.978,"Oh, and say hello to the minnows for me."
00:05:53.061,00:05:55.397,They're just the cutest little fish.
00:05:55.480,00:05:58.233,"Thanks, Dipsy. You've been super helpful."
00:05:58.316,00:05:59.818,Thank you! I gotta go.
00:05:59.901,00:06:00.986,It's time for my lunch.
00:06:01.069,00:06:03.613,"But good luck downstream, and be careful."
00:06:03.697,00:06:05.615,The creek's pretty deep down there.
00:06:09.828,00:06:11.913,I don't see any blue rocks.
00:06:11.997,00:06:13.748,That's okay! Look!
00:06:13.832,00:06:16.251,There are Millie's glasses. See?
00:06:18.587,00:06:20.505,We can't get down that far.
00:06:20.589,00:06:23.341,"Sure, we can! Toby just has to build a submarine."
00:06:23.425,00:06:27.762,Yeah! Toby can build a big submarine with a popcorn machine!
00:06:27.846,00:06:29.723,And a roller coaster!
00:06:29.806,00:06:33.393,A submarine with a popcorn machine and a roller coaster!
00:06:33.476,00:06:36.813,Then we'll climb inside and go on an adventure with popcorn.
00:06:36.897,00:06:38.356,How long would that take?
00:06:38.440,00:06:42.986,It might be easier to find an animal that can swim to the bottom of the creek.
00:06:43.069,00:06:46.072,Let's think about who we know that could do that.
00:06:51.953,00:06:53.580,"We can find him later, Bean."
00:06:53.663,00:06:58.251,"Right now, we are trying to figure out who can help us get my glasses back."
00:06:58.335,00:07:01.796,I know. I just saw him right over there.
00:07:01.880,00:07:05.091,"I don't see him, unless he looks like rocks or trees."
00:07:05.216,00:07:07.385,He went that way. I promise!
00:07:07.469,00:07:12.265,"Well, the flying fish would definitely be able to help if we could find him."
00:07:12.349,00:07:15.518,"Bean, lead the way to that fish."
00:07:15.602,00:07:17.520,Come on!
00:07:20.774,00:07:25.111,Tell me again. Why are we chasing the flying fish?
00:07:25.195,00:07:30.367,Because he's the only one around here who can get Millie's glasses off the bottom of the creek.
00:07:30.450,00:07:32.243,Yes! We have to find him.
00:07:32.327,00:07:34.496,So which way did he fly?
00:07:34.579,00:07:37.999,-He didn't. He walked. -He walked?
00:07:38.083,00:07:41.920,Yup. He came out of the water and kind of scurried into the bushes.
00:07:42.003,00:07:47.008,"So if we follow the facts, that means our flying fish has feet."
00:07:47.092,00:07:51.054,"And if he's got feet, he's left footprints."
00:07:52.722,00:07:57.852,Our flying and walking fish went this way. Come on!
00:08:05.694,00:08:08.029,That's definitely a clue.
00:08:10.490,00:08:12.826,Dipsy. Hello?
00:08:12.909,00:08:14.744,"Hi, detectives and detectives' friends!"
00:08:14.828,00:08:16.329,Are you on the case?
00:08:16.413,00:08:19.416,Did you see the minnows? Did you find your friend's glasses?
00:08:19.499,00:08:25.296,"Yes. They were right where you said they'd be, -but it was too deep for us. -Right by the blue rocks?"
00:08:25.380,00:08:27.841,We never saw any blue rocks.
00:08:27.924,00:08:29.467,Really? That's strange.
00:08:29.551,00:08:31.594,They're right there by the minnows.
00:08:31.678,00:08:33.513,"Oh, those minnows are so cute!"
00:08:33.596,00:08:35.932,"Oh, yeah, the minnows."
00:08:36.016,00:08:37.642,You mentioned them before.
00:08:37.726,00:08:39.519,I almost never see fish.
00:08:39.602,00:08:42.147,Really? I see them all the time.
00:08:42.230,00:08:44.649,Wait a minute.
00:08:44.733,00:08:46.776,All that stuff is underwater.
00:08:46.860,00:08:48.413,That's why we need the flying fish.
00:08:48.488,00:08:52.813,"We need someone who can dive, sploosh, to the bottom of the creek and get back Millie's glasses."
00:08:54.951,00:08:57.370,"-Uh, Dipsy? -I can do that!"
00:08:57.454,00:09:00.457,"I go, sploosh, down there all the time. Come on!"
00:09:03.752,00:09:06.171,I think we just found our flying fish.
00:09:06.254,00:09:10.133,And she's not a fish at all. It's Dipsy.
00:09:13.511,00:09:16.514,"I see them, right down there by the blue rocks!"
00:09:21.019,00:09:22.937,What's happening? What's happening?
00:09:23.063,00:09:25.732,Dipsy just walked into the water.
00:09:25.815,00:09:28.318,-And dove under! -Of course.
00:09:28.401,00:09:31.404,That's why Dipsy told us to look out for minnows.
00:09:36.119,00:09:41.372,"All the time, we were looking for a flying fish, but what Bean saw wasn't a flying fish at all."
00:09:41.456,00:09:43.333,It was a bird that swims.
00:09:43.416,00:09:51.132,"Everything about ouzels, from the shape of their tails to how their eyes work, is designed so they can walk around and even fly underwater."
00:09:51.216,00:09:52.884,-Cool! -Amazing.
00:09:52.967,00:09:56.930,Ooh! I want to see that when I get my glasses back.
00:10:04.854,00:10:06.815,"good as new, and they're really clean."
00:10:15.323,00:10:17.575,It's nice to finally meet you.
00:10:17.659,00:10:19.577,"Thanks so much, Dipsy!"
00:10:19.661,00:10:22.789,"Of course! I love helping, and I love seeing the minnows."
00:10:22.872,00:10:25.083,"But, weren't you looking for a flying fish?"
00:10:27.377,00:10:30.380,"but it was a bird all the time, an ouzel!"
00:10:41.724,00:10:44.686,"You know, ouzel is really fun to say."
00:10:44.769,00:10:46.521,Then let's say it all together.
00:10:46.604,00:10:49.190,"Say, Ouzel!"
00:10:49.274,00:10:50.358,-Ouzel! -Ouzel!
00:10:53.862,00:11:02.412,"Bean thought he was a flying fish, but when we used the clues, we discovered the fish wasn't a fish at all, but an amazing little songbird."
00:11:02.495,00:11:06.958,Yup. We made a new friend and got Millie's glasses back.
00:11:42.118,00:11:44.829,Mmm.
00:11:50.251,00:11:53.546,It looks just like Rumy! Thanks for letting me help!
00:11:53.630,00:11:56.633,And thanks for baking your famous sourdough pretzels.
00:11:56.716,00:11:58.426,"Oh, they're my favorite!"
00:11:58.509,00:12:02.180,My way of saying thank you for being the artiste's assistant.
00:12:02.507,00:12:05.725,"Now that we're done, I think I'll sit down and have a piece, too."
00:12:10.980,00:12:16.736,"All right, let's smooth everything out and unveil our masterpiece."
00:12:22.158,00:12:25.161,That's it! Snow Rumy is perfect.
00:12:25.245,00:12:26.621,Let's go get everyone.
00:12:26.704,00:12:28.248,You got it!
00:12:35.338,00:12:36.214,Here's your carrot.
00:12:36.297,00:12:38.299,I got the biggest one in the treehouse.
00:12:38.383,00:12:39.884,You must be really hungry.
00:12:39.968,00:12:42.470,"Thank you, Jay. But the carrot's not for me."
00:12:42.553,00:12:43.805,It's for our snowman.
00:12:43.888,00:12:46.182,"Snowmen don't eat carrots, do they?"
00:12:50.979,00:12:53.606,"Oh, I see what you mean now."
00:12:53.690,00:12:55.191,That makes way more sense.
00:12:55.275,00:12:58.194,"Hey, Toby, what do you think of our snowman?"
00:12:59.487,00:13:00.530,He looks great!
00:13:01.406,00:13:03.116,What are you putting on the stairs?
00:13:03.199,00:13:06.703,Salt. It melts the snow so the stairs aren't slippery.
00:13:08.204,00:13:14.669,"Really? So if I walk on the stairs, they won't be-- W-Whoa!"
00:13:14.752,00:13:15.795,Gotcha.
00:13:15.878,00:13:17.964,I hadn't done the bottom yet.
00:13:24.220,00:13:28.891,It just may be my greatest artistic achievement ever!
00:13:28.975,00:13:31.144,-Let's go! -Can't wait to see it!
00:13:32.895,00:13:36.774,"I give you my masterwork, Joyous Pig!"
00:13:39.152,00:13:42.613,It's very... modern?
00:13:46.075,00:13:47.577,It's all melty.
00:13:47.660,00:13:50.705,"When we left here, it looked just like Rumy."
00:13:54.083,00:14:00.381,"you know, if I tuck my arm here and put my head down and twist my leg here."
00:14:03.676,00:14:06.262,It looks like snow Rumy just started to melt.
00:14:06.346,00:14:09.474,"I mean, that happens, right? Snow melts, and it's made of snow."
00:14:09.557,00:14:15.688,"B-But we just finished, and it's really cold out here, so it shouldn't have melted so fast."
00:14:15.813,00:14:18.149,How did this happen?
00:14:18.232,00:14:20.443,That's what we need to figure out.
00:14:20.526,00:14:22.820,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:14:22.904,00:14:24.489,Will you excuse us?
00:14:24.572,00:14:26.491,To the treehouse!
00:14:30.953,00:14:36.250,"Millie and Bean were only gone a few minutes, and snow Rumy is already melting."
00:14:36.334,00:14:40.171,"For the sake of artists everywhere, we've got to crack this case."
00:14:40.254,00:14:42.131,There's a lot at stake.
00:14:42.215,00:14:45.176,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:14:45.259,00:14:47.512,Let's do this!
00:15:17.125,00:15:22.380,"If we're going to figure out what happened to Millie's sculpture, we need to follow the facts."
00:15:22.463,00:15:24.382,Let's look for clues to use.
00:15:24.465,00:15:26.426,Is anything else around here melting?
00:15:29.011,00:15:31.097,These icicles are going...
00:15:32.682,00:15:34.600,"drip, drip-drip."
00:15:34.684,00:15:39.021,Jay's right! These icicles are definitely melting.
00:15:40.606,00:15:44.068,The ones here in the shade aren't.
00:15:44.193,00:15:50.491,"Sure! Because it's warmer here in the sun, and when the icicles warm up, they melt."
00:15:50.575,00:15:53.286,"Millie, was your snow sculpture in the sun?"
00:15:53.369,00:15:56.080,Hmm. I don't remember.
00:16:00.001,00:16:05.423,"Look! Millie's sculpture is in the sun, so that explains why it melted. Case closed."
00:16:05.506,00:16:07.383,"Great detective work, everyone."
00:16:07.467,00:16:12.346,Bean and I just have to make our next masterpiece someplace shady so it won't melt.
00:16:12.430,00:16:14.223,We should go to Shady Glade!
00:16:14.307,00:16:18.102,Oh! Shady Glade is the shadiest of glades.
00:16:18.186,00:16:20.104,Then that's where we're going.
00:16:20.188,00:16:22.148,I guess this case is closed.
00:16:22.273,00:16:26.569,"Thanks, everybody! We'll call you when we're ready to unveil the next masterpiece."
00:16:31.324,00:16:35.828,"Ah, I need to remember to bake pretzels every time I'm making great art."
00:16:35.912,00:16:38.122,All this creating makes you hungry.
00:16:38.206,00:16:44.003,Yeah! And we need our energy to sculpt our never-gonna-melt Rumy sculpture.
00:16:57.391,00:17:00.853,I call this one Rumy With a View.
00:17:02.438,00:17:04.106,You guys were right.
00:17:04.190,00:17:08.569,This was the perfect spot to set free my artistic instincts.
00:17:08.653,00:17:09.987,Behold!
00:17:12.949,00:17:15.785,About my vision? My message?
00:17:15.868,00:17:18.955,"No, about my nose."
00:17:19.038,00:17:21.415,Does it really do that?
00:17:24.126,00:17:26.629,"How can this one melt, too?"
00:17:26.712,00:17:29.173,It's just terrible.
00:17:29.257,00:17:30.925,"Aw, don't be upset, Millie."
00:17:31.008,00:17:34.929,"If there's a pig out there with a melty face, he'd love this."
00:17:35.012,00:17:39.475,Looks like we're back on the case... again!
00:17:41.561,00:17:46.232,"I'm gonna take a sample, you know, for evidence."
00:17:46.315,00:17:48.609,"Okay, let's follow the facts."
00:17:48.693,00:17:50.486,What do we know for sure?
00:17:50.570,00:17:53.155,We know that snow-pigs melt faster than anything.
00:17:53.239,00:17:56.450,"As soon as Millie finishes one, it just goes all melty."
00:17:56.534,00:18:03.457,"You're right, Jay. Both sculptures melted, but one was in the sun, and one was in the shade."
00:18:03.541,00:18:08.504,"So if we use the clues, it had to be something else that made them melt."
00:18:08.588,00:18:12.174,"Toby, what about the snowman we made this morning?"
00:18:12.258,00:18:13.884,Of course!
00:18:13.968,00:18:17.346,We should see if he's melting just like Millie's sculptures.
00:18:21.142,00:18:23.769,Your snowman's not melted at all.
00:18:23.853,00:18:26.522,You're right. So what's different?
00:18:26.606,00:18:29.233,Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I know. I know.
00:18:31.986,00:18:33.738,But I know the answer.
00:18:33.821,00:18:38.242,"Both of Millie's statues had hats, but this one doesn't."
00:18:38.326,00:18:43.372,"Of course. There's nothing warmer than a nice hat, and warm is what melts snow."
00:18:43.456,00:18:47.585,You can still have a hat. It just needs to be made out of snow.
00:18:47.668,00:18:52.590,"Ah, yes, this adds a whole new something to our work."
00:18:52.673,00:18:55.384,A whole new-- What's the word?
00:18:55.468,00:18:57.094,"Um, hat?"
00:18:57.178,00:18:59.722,Exactly! Let's make a masterpiece.
00:18:59.805,00:19:02.350,"Come on, everyone. We'd love the help."
00:19:04.560,00:19:09.523,"I never thought I'd say it, but Rumy's gonna make a Rumy."
00:19:09.809,00:19:12.026,And we've got more of Millie's sourdough pretzels.
00:19:12.109,00:19:14.695,"When we get hungry, we can take a break and share them."
00:19:22.161,00:19:28.250,"Teri, look. The snow from Millie's sculpture isn't snow anymore. It's water!"
00:19:29.335,00:19:31.295,The snow has melted.
00:19:31.379,00:19:34.715,But wait. There's something floating around in there.
00:19:39.053,00:19:40.471,That makes sense.
00:19:40.554,00:19:44.558,"When Millie and Bean took breaks, they split a pretzel, right?"
00:19:44.642,00:19:48.104,"They did, but would pretzels melt snow?"
00:19:48.229,00:19:55.277,"Pretzels wouldn't, but Millie's sourdough pretzels are covered with sea salt, and when you put salt on snow..."
00:19:55.361,00:19:59.865,"It melts, like when I put salt on the stairs of the treehouse."
00:19:59.949,00:20:02.368,So when Millie and Bean ate the pretzel...
00:20:02.451,00:20:06.872,they got salt all over their mittens and the sculptures!
00:20:06.956,00:20:08.708,That's why they melted.
00:20:08.791,00:20:12.378,"Teri, Bean had four of the pretzels left."
00:20:12.461,00:20:17.425,"If those guys even touch the salty pretzels, they're going to melt another masterpiece."
00:20:17.508,00:20:20.720,Come on. Time to stop that snacking.
00:20:43.951,00:20:45.745,Not with those salty mittens!
00:20:45.828,00:20:48.706,H-How is there salt on our mittens?
00:20:50.207,00:20:52.376,It's from the pretzels.
00:20:52.460,00:20:58.424,"And when the salt got on Millie's sculptures, it made them melt, because salt melts snow."
00:21:00.801,00:21:04.889,"We're not finished, and now everyone's mittens are covered with salt."
00:21:04.972,00:21:08.684,No problem. I always carry extra mittens and snacks.
00:21:08.768,00:21:11.771,"Oh, and raisins will not melt your sculpture."
00:21:17.693,00:21:20.404,"Oh, and they make excellent eyes."
00:21:20.488,00:21:22.823,Wow! What a masterpiece!
00:21:25.576,00:21:26.952,"Come on, everybody."
00:21:27.036,00:21:30.039,"You don't want snow Rumy to get lonely, do you?"
00:21:31.999,00:21:33.959,"Great job, everybody!"
00:21:51.393,00:21:53.938,"Say, Snow sculpture!"
00:21:54.063,00:21:56.774,-Snow sculpture! -Snow sculpture!
00:21:59.235,00:22:04.657,We used the clues and followed the facts to figure out why Millie's snow sculptures were melting.
00:22:04.740,00:22:09.119,And now we know salty pretzels and snowmen don't mix.
00:22:09.203,00:22:11.163,Time to close this case.
00:22:33.561,00:22:35.563,is officially closed.
00:00:33.700,00:00:43.293,LITTLE DETECTIVES TOBY &amp; TERI Holiday cookies comin' through!
00:00:49.967,00:00:55.097,Yum! I think my very favorite part of the Festival of Friends is Millie's amazing cookies!
00:00:55.180,00:01:01.353,I think my favorite part is making homemade presents for whoever we pick as a festival friend.
00:01:01.436,00:01:04.565,It's exciting because you never know whose name you're gonna pick.
00:01:04.690,00:01:08.777,"And because we're all friends in Acorn Springs, it doesn't matter who you get."
00:01:09.945,00:01:11.863,Everything's looking great.
00:01:11.947,00:01:14.992,"Wow, that's really cool, Rumy. What is it?"
00:01:15.075,00:01:19.162,"I picked the hermit crab this year, so I made her a parasol."
00:01:19.246,00:01:20.747,I'm glad you like it.
00:01:20.831,00:01:25.168,"See? When the sun is out, she can carry this around and stay cool."
00:01:25.252,00:01:28.338,"-I can't wait to give it to her. -Hey, everyone!"
00:01:29.381,00:01:30.674,I have the presents.
00:01:36.263,00:01:37.848,"Oh, and here's mine."
00:01:37.931,00:01:42.686,"So if that's everything, the Festival of Friends can officially begin."
00:01:42.769,00:01:44.896,Then let's get all our friends.
00:01:54.489,00:01:58.076,"Wow. Fergus, look at all that stuff!"
00:01:58.160,00:02:00.704,This must be for the Festival of Friends.
00:02:00.787,00:02:03.540,"-Teri invited us, remember? -Oh, right."
00:02:03.624,00:02:08.837,Everyone picks the name of a festival friend and makes them a homemade present.
00:02:08.920,00:02:10.589,These must be the presents!
00:02:10.672,00:02:19.723,"Or maybe these are the things they weren't giving each other, Then why would they all have tags on them?"
00:02:19.806,00:02:22.434,"See, the tag on that truck says, For Bean."
00:02:22.517,00:02:28.815,"Okay, so maybe this is for Bean, but until he shows up, I can play with it, right?"
00:02:28.899,00:02:31.860,"Uh, I don't think you should."
00:02:31.943,00:02:33.862,Who's gonna know? Nobody's here.
00:02:33.945,00:02:35.656,But they'll probably be here soon.
00:02:35.739,00:02:39.701,And they won't like it if they find you playing with their presents.
00:02:39.785,00:02:43.372,"Oh. I never thought of that. Good thinking, Fergus."
00:02:43.705,00:02:47.292,"We gotta get this stuff out of here. Come on, give me a hand."
00:02:47.376,00:02:50.545,Wait. Are you taking the presents?
00:02:50.629,00:02:52.798,"Uh, that's not what I meant."
00:02:54.424,00:03:01.014,"We're not taking them. We're just borrowing so we can play with them for a bit. Now, let's go."
00:03:09.064,00:03:11.024,Hear ye! Hear ye!
00:03:11.149,00:03:14.820,"The old oak has been prepared, and our presents are in place!"
00:03:14.903,00:03:19.324,It's time to celebrate the past year and give thanks to our great friends.
00:03:19.408,00:03:25.288,"And with that, let's turn on the holiday lights and let the Festival of Friends begin."
00:03:25.372,00:03:27.666,-Whoo-hoo! -All right!
00:03:27.791,00:03:36.049,"As this year's Parade Master, I'll be leading the Procession of Pals that begins the Festival, so follow me, friends!"
00:03:45.892,00:03:49.896,"It's beautiful, and I like how you hid the presents."
00:03:52.482,00:03:54.443,They're right there in the wagon.
00:03:55.610,00:03:59.197,"Oh, no! All the presents are gone!"
00:03:59.281,00:04:01.533,"And the wagon is missing, too!"
00:04:05.120,00:04:08.749,"How do we have a Festival of Friends without all the wonderful, amazing things we made?"
00:04:09.040,00:04:14.713,"Don't worry. Whatever happened to those presents, Toby and I will find them and bring them back."
00:04:14.796,00:04:16.840,It sounds like we've got a case.
00:04:16.965,00:04:18.633,Will you excuse us?
00:04:18.717,00:04:20.719,To the treehouse!
00:04:27.058,00:04:30.937,Everyone put a lot of time and love into making those presents.
00:04:31.062,00:04:36.485,Sharing those gifts is a part of what makes the Festival of Friends so special. We just gotta find 'em.
00:04:36.568,00:04:38.236,There's a lot at stake.
00:04:38.320,00:04:41.281,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:04:41.364,00:04:43.200,Let's do this!
00:05:13.355,00:05:15.565,-Did you find the presents? -No.
00:05:15.816,00:05:17.484,We went to get our detective stuff.
00:05:17.567,00:05:22.697,"-It's gonna be okay. -We'll use the clues, starting with these wagon tracks."
00:05:23.740,00:05:26.743,Whoever took the presents used the wagon to do it.
00:05:26.827,00:05:28.119,We won't be long.
00:05:28.203,00:05:29.913,-See you! -Good luck!
00:05:29.996,00:05:32.749,I hope they find the presents soon.
00:05:35.669,00:05:37.963,to seeing what everyone made this year.
00:05:38.046,00:05:41.466,I know. Let's find a new way to thank our friends.
00:05:41.591,00:05:47.722,"We may not have presents to give, but we could give each other the gift of dance."
00:05:50.767,00:05:51.893,poetic.
00:05:51.977,00:05:55.355,"Since it's a dance to friendship, we should do it together."
00:05:55.438,00:05:58.149,"Great idea! Everyone, make a circle."
00:05:58.233,00:06:02.779,Yeah! And then we can all celebrate each other with dance!
00:06:02.863,00:06:06.157,I can start! Watch me work.
00:06:13.832,00:06:14.791,All right!
00:06:20.714,00:06:24.426,This is the perfect spot to play with our presents.
00:06:24.509,00:06:26.303,Now let's see what we've got.
00:06:26.386,00:06:27.971,Our presents?
00:06:28.054,00:06:31.308,How can they be ours if we're giving them back?
00:06:31.391,00:06:34.561,"Yeah, yeah, they're just ours until we're done with them."
00:06:34.644,00:06:37.272,"We'll return them all, except maybe this doll."
00:06:38.523,00:06:40.567,And nobody's gonna miss this.
00:06:44.237,00:06:46.323,Ooh! And I've always wanted one of these.
00:06:46.406,00:06:50.535,"And, I don't even know what this does, but I want it!"
00:06:52.454,00:06:53.455,Ohh!
00:07:02.422,00:07:05.008,"Go, Wayne! Go, Wayne!"
00:07:05.091,00:07:08.762,"Hey, guys, this is my dance to friendship!"
00:07:10.805,00:07:13.433,-All right! -Whoa!
00:07:15.894,00:07:17.896,"Ooh. Toby, look."
00:07:17.979,00:07:19.689,It's a feather.
00:07:21.107,00:07:23.026,That's evidence for sure.
00:07:23.109,00:07:25.779,Wait a minute. Are these wolf prints?
00:07:25.862,00:07:27.989,A feather and wolf prints? Of course.
00:07:28.073,00:07:30.158,The feather has to belong to Poe!
00:07:30.241,00:07:35.830,"And his best friend is Fergus, and he's a wolf pup, so that's why we've got wolf prints."
00:07:35.914,00:07:38.083,And look! Down that trail.
00:07:40.961,00:07:43.380,It's a ribbon from one of the presents.
00:07:43.463,00:07:48.301,"I'll bet Poe, Fergus, and our missing presents went this way."
00:07:49.844,00:07:53.598,I'm sitting in a huge pile of presents.
00:07:59.396,00:08:02.524,Maybe it's because those presents weren't meant for you.
00:08:02.607,00:08:04.943,And you know you should give them back.
00:08:05.026,00:08:07.153,But I'm not done playing with them!
00:08:07.237,00:08:11.366,"Poe, each one of these presents was made especially for someone."
00:08:11.449,00:08:13.827,And presents aren't presents when you take them.
00:08:13.910,00:08:16.538,It's the sharing with friends that makes them special.
00:08:17.998,00:08:19.541,Here you go.
00:08:19.624,00:08:20.667,What's this?
00:08:23.294,00:08:25.588,-we made you something special. -Oh.
00:08:25.672,00:08:28.133,It's pictures from the first time we met.
00:08:28.216,00:08:31.553,You made this just for me? Why?
00:08:31.636,00:08:36.433,"Because you're our friend, and it feels really good to give something special to a friend."
00:08:36.558,00:08:38.560,Haven't you ever given something to a friend?
00:08:39.561,00:08:40.854,I'm not giving you my picture.
00:08:40.937,00:08:42.439,You don't have to.
00:08:42.522,00:08:45.150,Here. This is for Fergus.
00:08:48.778,00:08:51.781,Go ahead. You can give it to him if you want.
00:08:51.906,00:08:54.242,"Eh, I don't know."
00:08:54.325,00:09:03.418,"I could really use this exact thingie I didn't know I previously needed, but I think you'd like it more than me, Fergus."
00:09:03.501,00:09:04.711,Here you go.
00:09:04.794,00:09:07.005,"Thanks, Poe. I love it!"
00:09:08.339,00:09:12.260,"Wow, you do? I'm glad you like it."
00:09:12.343,00:09:13.928,Wow.
00:09:14.012,00:09:17.849,It feels nice to share something with a friend.
00:09:17.932,00:09:18.975,Who knew?
00:09:19.684,00:09:24.773,"You know, tiny ants, bats, and even elephants all give to each other."
00:09:24.856,00:09:28.359,And you know who else shares things with animals that they care about?
00:09:28.443,00:09:30.653,Ravens. It's how they make friends.
00:09:30.737,00:09:34.866,"Well, no one will wanna be friends with a raven who took all their presents."
00:09:34.991,00:09:36.951,Unless he gives them back.
00:09:39.746,00:09:40.914,All right!
00:09:40.997,00:09:44.417,You guys know how to throw a first-rate shindig.
00:09:44.501,00:09:46.920,I don't know how this could have been any more fun.
00:09:52.634,00:09:55.220,We found someone special to hand them out.
00:09:55.303,00:09:59.599,"Hi, everyone! I'm Papa Acorn!"
00:09:59.682,00:10:04.604,And I'm here to give you all the special things you made for each other.
00:10:04.687,00:10:09.317,"And I've brought my trusty sidekick, the Present Wolf, to help."
00:10:11.694,00:10:13.321,Uh...
00:10:13.404,00:10:15.865,I'm sorry I took your presents.
00:10:15.949,00:10:18.034,I didn't know how much they meant to you.
00:10:18.118,00:10:22.705,But now I understand how it feels to give a friend something special.
00:10:22.831,00:10:24.958,Let's see what we have here.
00:10:25.041,00:10:29.379,"Hermit crab, this is for you, from your friend, Rumy!"
00:10:32.090,00:10:34.300,"Aw, you're welcome."
00:10:35.385,00:10:39.639,"Everyone gather round, and let's see what else is in Papa Acorn's wagon!"
00:10:39.722,00:10:42.183,Papa Acorn should give out the presents every year.
00:10:44.769,00:10:46.938,"Oh, I'd love that."
00:10:48.148,00:10:51.192,"Everyone smile, and say, Friends!"
00:10:51.276,00:10:53.444,-Friends! -Friends!
00:10:56.781,00:11:01.578,I think one of the best parts of having friends is letting them know how you feel about them.
00:11:01.661,00:11:08.710,And I'm glad Poe learned how great it feels to give a friend something special. I can't wait to see what Papa Acorn brings everyone next year.
00:11:08.793,00:11:10.295,Time to close this case.
00:11:33.067,00:11:34.485,is officially closed.
00:11:39.949,00:11:41.951,Everybody ready for New Year's Eve?
00:11:42.035,00:11:44.078,Yes! I made decorations!
00:11:44.162,00:11:46.497,And Rumy and I invented something new!
00:11:46.581,00:11:49.542,-The acorn popper! -Hooray!
00:11:55.673,00:11:58.009,Look. It's open and ready for dreams.
00:11:58.092,00:12:05.308,That's right. It's not New Year's unless we all write our biggest dreams for the coming year so we can make them come true.
00:12:06.100,00:12:09.562,"This year, I'm finally going to perfect my triple loop-de-loop!"
00:12:09.687,00:12:12.232,I want to learn a new language.
00:12:12.315,00:12:15.777,I want to climb the tallest tree in Acorn Springs.
00:12:15.860,00:12:18.571,"What about you, Rumy? What's your dream?"
00:12:18.655,00:12:21.282,"Oh, I don't want to say."
00:12:23.826,00:12:25.662,No one's dreams are silly.
00:12:25.745,00:12:29.916,"Whatever your dream is, we'll all help you to make it come true."
00:12:29.999,00:12:39.842,"Okay. Well, I kinda wish I could be a real Treehouse Detective just like you guys with a badge and everything."
00:12:43.221,00:12:45.306,"-I wanna be a detective! -I want that, too!"
00:12:45.473,00:12:51.229,"I think we'd all like to be Treehouse Detectives, but what do we do?"
00:12:51.312,00:12:57.235,"Well, you're going to need a case to solve, a good one with clues to use and facts to follow."
00:12:57.318,00:12:59.404,So you'll find us one?
00:12:59.487,00:13:03.491,Of course. Sounds like we've got a case.
00:13:03.574,00:13:05.076,Will you excuse us?
00:13:05.159,00:13:06.953,To the treehouse!
00:13:12.417,00:13:21.092,"If our friends are going to earn their detective badges, they need a really important case to crack, but we don't have anything to solve right now."
00:13:21.175,00:13:24.429,Wait a minute. What if we're the case?
00:13:24.512,00:13:26.597,What if they have to find us?
00:13:26.681,00:13:31.728,Hmm. Toby and Teri are missing.
00:13:31.811,00:13:34.355,Sounds like there's a lot at stake.
00:13:34.439,00:13:37.400,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:13:37.483,00:13:39.152,Let's do this.
00:14:20.526,00:14:24.238,Oh! I think a UFO just landed on the table!
00:14:24.322,00:14:27.200,What planet are you from?!
00:14:27.283,00:14:31.496,It's not a UFO. It's a note from Toby and Teri.
00:14:31.579,00:14:34.082,Treehouse Detectives use the clues.
00:14:34.165,00:14:36.584,I know for you that is no news.
00:14:36.667,00:14:41.589,Our New Year's party cannot start until you guys have done your part.
00:14:41.672,00:14:44.550,Until we've done our part? But what's our part?
00:14:47.428,00:14:50.515,"But what is our case? Oh, I'm so confused."
00:14:50.598,00:14:53.309,"Oh, too bad Toby and Teri aren't here."
00:14:53.393,00:14:56.396,They'd be able to figure out this clue for sure.
00:14:56.479,00:14:59.273,That's it! Rumy's right!
00:14:59.357,00:15:02.652,Toby and Teri are missing. They're the case.
00:15:02.735,00:15:03.986,They are?
00:15:04.070,00:15:06.864,Yes! And listen. There's more.
00:15:06.948,00:15:09.409,You'll notice that we're not around.
00:15:09.492,00:15:12.912,You'll find your first clue on the ground.
00:15:13.037,00:15:15.456,Let's see. What's on the ground?
00:15:15.540,00:15:19.794,"Hmm. Dirt and grass and rocks, and Toby and Teri's footprints, and some ants."
00:15:19.877,00:15:21.379,Oh! Are ants the clue?
00:15:21.462,00:15:26.175,"I don't think so, but let's take a look at those footprints."
00:15:27.969,00:15:30.179,"These are Toby and Teri's, all right."
00:15:33.683,00:15:35.351,Whoa!
00:15:35.435,00:15:37.311,Whoa. What happened?
00:15:37.395,00:15:38.855,I bumped into a bag.
00:15:46.654,00:15:49.449,And look! It's full of detective stuff.
00:15:49.532,00:15:52.493,Toby and Teri must have left it here to help us.
00:15:52.577,00:15:55.621,-Now we can follow the facts. -Like real detectives.
00:15:55.705,00:15:57.790,Oh! And that means they were here!
00:15:57.874,00:16:00.585,I can see their footprints lead into the forest.
00:16:00.668,00:16:03.129,We've used our first clue. Come on!
00:16:03.212,00:16:04.464,-Whoo-hoo! -Let's go!
00:16:11.637,00:16:12.722,Whoa!
00:16:14.015,00:16:15.766,"Hey, gang. What you doing?"
00:16:15.850,00:16:17.977,We're using the clues to find Toby and Teri.
00:16:18.060,00:16:22.815,"It's our very own case. And their footprints led to you, which means-- What does it mean?"
00:16:22.940,00:16:25.735,"Well, it could mean that I've got your next clue."
00:16:25.818,00:16:29.530,Wow! Those mittens are really nice.
00:16:29.614,00:16:33.910,"Thanks! I couldn't decide on a color, so I didn't."
00:16:33.993,00:16:35.203,Here's your clue.
00:16:35.286,00:16:36.829,"Good luck, you guys."
00:16:36.913,00:16:38.998,"-Thank you! -Thanks, Rocco!"
00:16:39.081,00:16:41.125,-What's it say? -Ahem.
00:16:41.209,00:16:45.922,Good detectives always see when things seem out of place.
00:16:46.005,00:16:51.052,"Find those things, because they're clues to help you crack this case."
00:16:51.135,00:16:53.387,So our next clue is something out of place?
00:16:53.554,00:16:55.473,But what's out of place?
00:16:55.556,00:17:01.020,"Well, I see winter stuff, winter bushes and winter trees and winter sunflowers."
00:17:01.103,00:17:03.272,"Wait. Did you say, Sunflowers?"
00:17:03.356,00:17:07.735,"Sunflowers don't fit in, not in the winter, just like the riddle. They must be the clue."
00:17:08.069,00:17:09.737,Jay's right! Come on!
00:17:09.820,00:17:12.532,We've got some sunflowers to investigate.
00:17:15.201,00:17:19.956,Wow. These are really pretty and really yellow.
00:17:26.379,00:17:29.006,Hello. Have you got a clue for us?
00:17:31.425,00:17:35.263,"Oh, that's a hard one. Do you think it's some kind of code?"
00:17:35.346,00:17:38.641,"No, I think that's the sound of a moose with something in his mouth."
00:17:40.601,00:17:43.312,"Thanks! Great job, guys!"
00:17:43.437,00:17:47.316,"Just keep using those clues, and I'll see you at the party."
00:17:47.400,00:17:48.651,Bye for now!
00:17:48.734,00:17:50.820,"-Thanks, moose! -See you later!"
00:17:50.903,00:18:00.454,"Your next clue waits in a cool, dark place somewhere out of sight, waiting with a friend of ours who really likes the night."
00:18:00.538,00:18:03.374,"Oh! Ooh! Oh, I think I know this one."
00:18:03.457,00:18:04.709,Can I try?
00:18:04.792,00:18:07.878,Absolutely. So what do you think it means?
00:18:09.922,00:18:11.591,"Um, I-I think..."
00:18:11.674,00:18:14.093,-Bean can do this one. -I don't know.
00:18:17.555,00:18:22.268,"She likes the night, and her cave is cool and dark."
00:18:22.351,00:18:24.437,It's totally the bat!
00:18:24.520,00:18:27.398,"Great job, Rumy! You did it!"
00:18:27.481,00:18:30.192,Let's get to the cave and crack this case.
00:18:30.276,00:18:31.986,-Okay! -Yeah!
00:18:32.069,00:18:34.822,Yes! Nailed it!
00:18:41.037,00:18:42.079,"-Hi, guys! -Hey!"
00:18:42.163,00:18:43.331,-Hi there! -Hi.
00:18:43.414,00:18:45.291,Here's your final clue.
00:18:46.292,00:18:48.336,Thanks.
00:18:48.419,00:18:54.133,"Okay. You've got all the clues you need, but now you must be brave."
00:18:54.216,00:18:59.263,The final thing you need to know is deeper in this cave.
00:19:02.600,00:19:05.728,Look! It's a glowing cave rock.
00:19:08.105,00:19:11.400,"No, wait. It's Teri's WhyTab."
00:19:11.484,00:19:14.403,"It is! Great job, Rumy."
00:19:14.487,00:19:15.863,"Quick, tap the screen."
00:19:17.865,00:19:19.659,Great job making it this far.
00:19:19.742,00:19:22.203,Cool! It's a secret message for us!
00:19:22.286,00:19:28.000,You're almost there. Remember how we said that clues are things that don't fit in? Well...
00:19:28.084,00:19:31.420,There was something special about every animal you met.
00:19:31.504,00:19:33.798,If you can remember what it was...
00:19:36.133,00:19:40.721,"And since I always find a useful fact on the WhyTab, here's one for you."
00:19:40.805,00:19:46.602,"Pigs have amazing memories, so if you need to remember something, just ask a pig."
00:19:49.730,00:19:53.067,But we don't know any pigs except me.
00:19:53.150,00:19:57.196,So that means you're gonna crack this case!
00:19:59.990,00:20:03.577,"Uh, oh, no. I don't think I can."
00:20:03.661,00:20:05.371,Of course you can.
00:20:05.454,00:20:07.998,"Rumy, just try, and you'll see."
00:20:08.082,00:20:09.875,"Yeah, don't be afraid to speak up."
00:20:09.959,00:20:13.045,It's not so scary when your friends are beside you.
00:20:13.129,00:20:16.006,And your friends know you can do it. So go on.
00:20:16.090,00:20:20.344,Think hard. What was different about all the animals we met?
00:20:25.599,00:20:31.439,"Rocco had mittens, and they were different colors, red and orange."
00:20:31.522,00:20:38.028,And next to the pretend yellow sunflowers was the moose wearing a really green hat!
00:20:38.112,00:20:44.410,"Oh, and the bat was wearing a beautiful blue, indigo, and violet scarf."
00:20:51.542,00:20:54.462,they're the colors of the rainbow!
00:20:54.545,00:20:56.005,A rainbow.
00:20:56.088,00:20:57.882,Toby and Teri are at...
00:21:07.349,00:21:09.894,Congratulations. You cracked the case.
00:21:12.146,00:21:14.940,You guys are amazing detectives!
00:21:15.024,00:21:16.484,"So are you, Rumy."
00:21:16.567,00:21:20.321,I'd say you guys have definitely earned your badges.
00:21:20.404,00:21:24.700,You are now officially Treehouse Detectives.
00:21:31.123,00:21:32.458,What about you guys?
00:21:32.541,00:21:35.544,You haven't told us your dream for the coming year.
00:21:35.628,00:21:37.838,We just want to solve more cases.
00:21:37.922,00:21:39.882,With our very best friends.
00:21:39.965,00:21:41.884,-Yeah! -I hear that!
00:21:41.967,00:21:46.013,"Okay, Treehouse Detectives, say, Happy New Year!"
00:21:47.348,00:21:49.058,-Happy New Year! -Happy New Year!
00:21:52.937,00:21:57.441,"This was my favorite case ever, and we didn't even solve it."
00:21:57.525,00:22:02.196,I know! It was solved by Acorn Springs' newest detectives.
00:22:02.279,00:22:06.617,I have a feeling this year is going to be the best one yet.
00:22:06.700,00:22:10.496,"I think so, too. Time to close this case."
00:22:33.352,00:22:35.437,is officially closed.
00:00:33.534,00:00:43.085,"LITTLE DETECTIVES TOBY &amp; TERI Ready or not, here I come!"
00:00:50.801,00:00:53.762,"You're it! Everybody, Rumy's it!"
00:00:53.845,00:00:55.180,"-Yay! -Your turn, Rumy."
00:00:55.722,00:00:59.935,"Okay. Three, two, one."
00:01:00.018,00:01:03.146,"Ready or not, here I come!"
00:01:08.986,00:01:10.821,Aha! Gotcha!
00:01:11.446,00:01:12.906,-Ahh! -Ahh!
00:01:14.199,00:01:17.828,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were one of my friends."
00:01:18.078,00:01:20.455,We're playing hide-and-seek tag.
00:01:20.539,00:01:21.832,I'm Rumy!
00:01:21.957,00:01:24.293,Nice to meet you. I'm Fergus.
00:01:24.376,00:01:27.129,I'm playing follow the leader with my friend Poe.
00:01:31.300,00:01:32.843,"-Hi, Fergus! -Hi, Fergus!"
00:01:33.135,00:01:35.262,He's playing follow the leader.
00:01:35.470,00:01:36.634,I love follow the leader.
00:01:36.709,00:01:40.934,"There's so much following and leading, Don't you need someone else to follow or lead?"
00:01:45.063,00:01:46.898,You guys wanna play with us?
00:01:47.274,00:01:49.526,-Sure! -Sounds good to me!
00:01:49.610,00:01:51.862,Okay. Follow me.
00:02:04.583,00:02:07.919,"Ooh, an apple! I love apples!"
00:02:15.636,00:02:18.055,This happens all the time to me.
00:02:18.138,00:02:22.059,I must be the clumsiest wolf in the whole forest.
00:02:27.981,00:02:30.484,It looks like somebody did this on purpose.
00:02:30.776,00:02:32.653,This was a mean prank.
00:02:35.197,00:02:36.740,"Fergus, what happened?!"
00:02:36.865,00:02:38.867,"Oh, hey, Poe."
00:02:38.950,00:02:42.079,I fell in a hole again.
00:02:42.162,00:02:44.706,But look at the new friends I made.
00:02:47.376,00:02:48.669,"-Hi, Poe! -Hey there!"
00:02:52.005,00:02:54.174,Someone played a prank on him.
00:02:54.257,00:02:56.593,Toby and Teri are gonna find out who!
00:02:56.677,00:02:59.137,They're detectives. They use clues and follow facts.
00:02:59.221,00:03:02.182,Can you really find out who's doing this to me?
00:03:02.474,00:03:04.393,"We can, and we will."
00:03:04.559,00:03:05.936,"That's a promise, Fergus."
00:03:06.436,00:03:08.480,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:03:08.814,00:03:10.357,Will you excuse us?
00:03:10.440,00:03:12.109,To the treehouse!
00:03:20.283,00:03:21.702,and we have to figure out who.
00:03:22.035,00:03:25.956,We've gotta stop this prankster before somebody really gets hurt.
00:03:26.039,00:03:27.541,There's a lot at stake.
00:03:27.833,00:03:30.711,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:03:30.794,00:03:32.504,Let's do this.
00:04:01.867,00:04:05.328,"Okay, let's find this mean prankster."
00:04:05.579,00:04:07.706,Time to follow the facts.
00:04:08.915,00:04:12.210,Or we could just follow the footprints.
00:04:12.294,00:04:14.880,It looks like our prankster went this way. Look!
00:04:16.965,00:04:19.551,That was quick. How'd you find that so fast?
00:04:19.634,00:04:23.388,What can I say? It's what detectives do.
00:04:23.972,00:04:25.307,Now come on!
00:04:26.933,00:04:28.477,That's my line.
00:04:31.897,00:04:34.983,"Guys, it looks like the prankster went this way."
00:04:35.066,00:04:37.611,See? The tracks go right up this log.
00:04:48.872,00:04:50.373,Another prank!
00:04:50.832,00:04:52.417,Look at all those ropes.
00:04:52.501,00:04:56.546,Whoever did this knows about ropes and pulleys and pranks.
00:04:56.630,00:05:00.091,"That's what you call physics, or so they tell me."
00:05:00.175,00:05:02.594,Now come here. Let me clean you up.
00:05:08.350,00:05:10.560,But you sure fall a lot.
00:05:13.980,00:05:16.441,Are you kidding? We're best friends.
00:05:16.525,00:05:17.651,That what friends do.
00:05:17.984,00:05:19.694,Now let's find that prankster.
00:05:19.778,00:05:21.238,I bet he left more footprints.
00:05:22.155,00:05:24.533,He did! They're over here!
00:05:26.326,00:05:28.078,Then that's the way we're going.
00:05:28.411,00:05:33.333,"You see, Tony, a good detective follows the clues and uses the facts."
00:05:34.376,00:05:36.711,"Now come on, guys. Let's shake a leg."
00:05:37.963,00:05:40.966,Toby. My name is Toby.
00:05:41.299,00:05:43.093,You gotta give it to him.
00:05:43.176,00:05:45.387,Poe is really good at finding clues.
00:05:45.470,00:05:48.056,Clues that lead us straight into pranks.
00:05:50.600,00:05:52.394,Totally! Write that down.
00:05:52.769,00:05:54.229,You got it.
00:06:05.782,00:06:08.201,Half a huckleberry jam sandwich.
00:06:08.285,00:06:10.161,The prankster must have left it.
00:06:10.245,00:06:13.206,"If we find the other half, it'll lead us straight to him."
00:06:13.915,00:06:15.458,Or her. We don't know.
00:06:19.963,00:06:22.257,"Hey, look. Here's the other half."
00:06:22.340,00:06:25.594,"Oh ho! Good sandwich spotting, Fergus!"
00:06:26.094,00:06:28.054,"He's right. Look, guys."
00:06:28.138,00:06:31.182,"Wait! That might be a prank! Millie, don't!"
00:06:39.107,00:06:43.361,Eww! Yuck! We're covered in jam!
00:06:46.031,00:06:51.202,"Sorry. I know this was a messy prank, but it's still jam. Mmm."
00:06:51.536,00:06:55.081,So Poe's clues led us right into another prank.
00:06:55.165,00:06:58.126,Funny how that happened. I've got an idea.
00:06:58.460,00:07:00.462,You guys head back to the treehouse.
00:07:00.545,00:07:03.340,I made some lemonade! I'm sure there are cookies!
00:07:07.218,00:07:09.012,Aren't you guys gonna come?
00:07:09.095,00:07:10.805,Sure. We'll be right there.
00:07:13.391,00:07:16.519,"We've used Poe's clues, and all it's gotten us is messy."
00:07:16.853,00:07:20.023,Let's take back this investigation and follow some real facts.
00:07:31.326,00:07:33.411,I drew up diagrams of the pranks.
00:07:33.662,00:07:36.998,I'd say whoever put these together knows what they're doing.
00:07:37.332,00:07:42.003,"But if our prankster is so clever, why'd he leave footprints where we could follow them?"
00:07:42.504,00:07:44.673,Maybe he wanted us to follow them.
00:07:47.842,00:07:50.595,Look! This is where they end.
00:07:57.102,00:08:01.106,-Look at this. -The prankster used that to make a trail to the pranks.
00:08:01.231,00:08:04.734,Look what else is back there! A feather.
00:08:10.031,00:08:12.617,But why would Poe play tricks on Fergus?
00:08:12.701,00:08:13.910,Aren't they best friends?
00:08:16.955,00:08:17.914,Listen to this!
00:08:18.206,00:08:25.672,"Ravens and wolves help each other find food and stay safe, but Ravens like to make a game of teasing wolf pups."
00:08:25.755,00:08:27.632,"Not around here, they don't."
00:08:28.174,00:08:31.052,Friends don't tease friends in Acorn Springs.
00:08:37.267,00:08:43.606,"Fergus loves swings, but when he swings on this one, he's gonna end up covered in berries."
00:08:46.651,00:08:48.361,Oh. Here they come.
00:08:48.486,00:08:50.864,"Huh, Poe sure was in a hurry."
00:08:50.947,00:08:52.198,Now where'd he go?
00:08:52.449,00:08:54.451,"Poe, where are you?!"
00:08:55.869,00:08:57.537,Look! A swing!
00:08:57.662,00:09:00.206,"Oh, no! Fergus, stop!"
00:09:00.290,00:09:02.125,Don't worry. I got this.
00:09:21.686,00:09:24.397,Poe! What happened?
00:09:27.859,00:09:30.528,And he just got caught in his own prank.
00:09:30.612,00:09:34.032,That doesn't make sense. Friends are nice to each other.
00:09:34.115,00:09:35.950,Fergus said you guys were best friends.
00:09:40.997,00:09:42.665,I thought it was funny.
00:09:42.749,00:09:45.210,I never thought about how it made you feel.
00:09:45.543,00:09:47.962,"Well, it made me feel bad."
00:09:48.379,00:09:50.632,You made me feel bad.
00:09:51.382,00:09:53.134,I know that now.
00:09:53.510,00:09:55.720,"I'm sorry, Fergus. I really am."
00:09:55.804,00:09:58.389,No more pranks. I promise.
00:09:58.556,00:10:00.058,Can we still be friends?
00:10:00.350,00:10:04.521,"If you stop pulling pranks, we can be best friends."
00:10:09.651,00:10:11.319,"Hey, you know what friends do?"
00:10:11.402,00:10:12.779,They give hugs?
00:10:12.862,00:10:14.155,They share snacks?
00:10:14.447,00:10:17.075,They build models of rocket ships and time machines.
00:10:17.158,00:10:22.247,"Maybe they could really work. Then they could all go on amazing adventures together, 'cause they're friends."
00:10:22.580,00:10:29.462,"Yes, uh, friends do all that, and they play hide-and-seek tag!"
00:10:31.297,00:10:32.715,"Poe, you're it!"
00:10:35.176,00:10:39.514,"Okay, everyone, three, two, one."
00:10:39.973,00:10:42.559,"Ready or not, here I come!"
00:10:50.942,00:10:52.527,-Friends! -Friends!
00:10:55.822,00:11:00.326,"You know, I think Poe finally understands that pulling pranks isn't nice."
00:11:00.410,00:11:05.707,"Yeah. By following the facts, we helped him learn to be a better friend. How cool is that?"
00:11:43.661,00:11:44.996,our best Fall Festival yet.
00:11:45.079,00:11:53.421,"Hey, isn't it time for the Great Horned Owl to swoop in and tell us who he's chosen to be Shining Star of the Fall Festival?"
00:12:03.389,00:12:11.814,"My dear friends of Acorn Springs, I am honored to announce this year's Shining Star of the Fall Festival."
00:12:12.148,00:12:14.734,Oh! Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be?
00:12:15.068,00:12:26.454,"Every year, we present this great honor to the individual who has the best design for our Friendship Tower, and we will build it together under his or her leadership."
00:12:28.623,00:12:30.291,There's always a crown.
00:12:30.625,00:12:33.253,This year Shining Star is...
00:12:34.754,00:12:35.880,Bean!
00:12:37.924,00:12:40.301,Wait a minute. Where is he?
00:12:45.682,00:12:48.142,What a great day.
00:12:49.435,00:12:50.853,"You know what, Jack?"
00:12:50.979,00:12:54.107,You're the best tree a squirrel could ask for.
00:13:00.321,00:13:01.447,"Hi, guys."
00:13:01.531,00:13:03.992,"Bean, you missed the announcement."
00:13:04.075,00:13:06.577,"Yeah, they crowned the Shining Star of the Festival."
00:13:06.869,00:13:10.665,"Oh, no! I totally lost track of time."
00:13:11.040,00:13:13.668,Who is it? Who's the Shining Star?
00:13:14.168,00:13:15.461,"It's you, Bean!"
00:13:15.753,00:13:19.215,"Me? As in me, me?"
00:13:19.674,00:13:21.926,Wait. Wait. Wait. Are you sure?
00:13:24.804,00:13:26.931,No one named Green lives in Acorn Springs.
00:13:27.015,00:13:28.099,It was definitely you.
00:13:28.433,00:13:29.684,I can't believe it.
00:13:29.767,00:13:32.061,I've always wanted to be Shining Star.
00:13:32.145,00:13:35.815,"Every year, I send a design, but I've never won until now!"
00:13:38.860,00:13:39.861,Wait.
00:13:39.944,00:13:43.489,There's something for each of you in my Friendship Tower.
00:13:43.865,00:13:46.200,-Really nice. -Whoa! Faboo!
00:13:46.534,00:13:50.496,"The best part, we're all going to build it together at the Festival!"
00:13:50.872,00:13:54.083,I know! I'm the Shining Star.
00:13:54.167,00:13:55.960,I'm-- I'm really the Shining Star.
00:13:56.294,00:13:58.629,"Can you believe it, Jack?"
00:13:58.713,00:14:01.132,My dream has come true.
00:14:01.466,00:14:03.760,"Did you say, Jack?"
00:14:04.093,00:14:06.512,Of course. Jack is my tree friend.
00:14:06.596,00:14:10.933,I spent all summer and fall relaxing in his shade and playing in his branches.
00:14:11.267,00:14:15.063,I even sketched my design right here up against his trunk.
00:14:15.313,00:14:19.275,That's pretty cool. I didn't know I wanted a tree friend until now.
00:14:19.567,00:14:22.028,We played together every day.
00:14:22.195,00:14:29.577,"One time, we were warriors, and another time, we were pirates in search of-- Whew! Oops."
00:14:29.702,00:14:32.330,"Ah, here you go, Jack. You dropped this."
00:14:32.705,00:14:36.000,"So, what do we do first, Shining Star?"
00:14:36.334,00:14:42.799,"Well, I'm thinking, uh-- Oh, Jack, you might want to hold on to your leaves."
00:14:42.882,00:14:44.675,"Here you go, buddy. Oh."
00:14:44.967,00:14:46.302,And this one.
00:14:46.511,00:14:48.513,"Oh, here's another. Huh."
00:14:48.846,00:14:51.641,"Guys, he's losing so many leaves."
00:14:51.808,00:14:54.102,I think Jack is sick.
00:14:54.560,00:14:58.606,"Oh, no, Bean. Trees lose their leaves every fall."
00:14:58.856,00:15:11.244,"Yeah, Rumy's right. Trees like Jack lose their leaves, because, uh-- Well, what Millie's trying to say is because-- I-It's easy, really. Uh..."
00:15:11.327,00:15:14.414,"Toby, Teri, why do trees lose their leaves?"
00:15:14.831,00:15:17.291,"You know, I actually don't know why."
00:15:17.625,00:15:22.004,"If you don't know why he's losing leaves, how do you know he's not sick?"
00:15:22.380,00:15:24.841,I'd better stay here and take care of him.
00:15:24.924,00:15:25.925,He's my friend.
00:15:34.225,00:15:39.605,"I really wanted to build my Friendship Tower, but my friend needs me."
00:15:48.531,00:15:54.662,We're going to figure out why Jack is losing his leaves so Bean can be the Shining Star. That's a promise.
00:15:54.871,00:15:56.414,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:15:56.789,00:15:58.082,Will you excuse us?
00:15:58.166,00:15:59.959,To the treehouse!
00:16:06.841,00:16:09.635,We know that trees lose their leaves every fall.
00:16:13.931,00:16:16.309,And he can be the Shining Star at the Festival.
00:16:16.684,00:16:18.644,There's a lot at stake.
00:16:18.728,00:16:21.397,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:16:51.344,00:16:57.558,"If we're going to figure out why Bean's tree is losing his leaves, let's start here, with oak trees."
00:16:57.892,00:17:00.269,Hmm. It's interesting.
00:17:00.520,00:17:03.481,It's like the trees let go of their leaves on purpose.
00:17:04.440,00:17:06.526,Now that's a clue we can use.
00:17:06.609,00:17:07.902,And we know-- Whoa!
00:17:12.073,00:17:13.741,Where are you going in such a hurry?
00:17:14.242,00:17:20.122,"Oh, I'm leaving town right after the Fall Festival, so I'm doing some last-minute packing."
00:17:20.289,00:17:22.625,Ohh. Have you seen my toothbrush?
00:17:22.917,00:17:25.836,Wait. You leave Acorn Springs?
00:17:26.170,00:17:29.382,Every year. I come back when it warms up again.
00:17:29.507,00:17:32.468,Winter is way too cold for me.
00:17:32.552,00:17:34.679,"Winter, too cold."
00:17:35.012,00:17:36.806,But it's not that cold now.
00:17:36.889,00:17:37.765,What's the rush?
00:17:38.099,00:17:41.227,"Well, winter's right around the corner."
00:17:41.310,00:17:47.483,"I can tell, because the days are getting shorter, which means it's time to find someplace sunny!"
00:17:47.900,00:17:49.777,"Oh, maybe with a pool."
00:17:50.111,00:17:53.030,"Hmm, so the Killdeer leaves town."
00:17:53.114,00:17:55.116,I wonder if that's a clue!
00:17:55.199,00:17:57.493,"Well, I got to keep packing."
00:17:57.577,00:17:59.704,-Good luck solving your case. -Thanks.
00:18:00.162,00:18:03.916,"All right, Toby, let's go follow some more facts."
00:18:06.210,00:18:08.212,"Hey, guys, look!"
00:18:10.172,00:18:13.551,I made a list of stuff that might make Jack feel better.
00:18:13.634,00:18:16.095,"Once he's better, I can be the Shining Star."
00:18:16.429,00:18:23.060,"Okay, five liters of herbal tea, a picture book, checkers, and a knitted sweater, size giant?"
00:18:23.144,00:18:24.687,Does it have to be green?
00:18:25.021,00:18:33.195,"Hey, If my buddy Bean thinks a gigantic green sweater will make Jack feel better, then green, it is! Come on!"
00:18:37.074,00:18:40.328,It looks like the hedgehogs are getting ready to nap.
00:18:40.411,00:18:43.623,"Over there by the trees, are those voles?"
00:18:47.585,00:18:48.461,Hello!
00:18:48.544,00:18:50.838,Whaah! Rocco! You scared me!
00:18:51.172,00:18:54.091,"Sorry, but I've been looking for you guys everywhere."
00:18:54.175,00:18:57.136,Check it out. Notice anything different about me?
00:18:57.803,00:19:00.097,"Um, are you taller?"
00:19:00.181,00:19:01.182,No.
00:19:01.265,00:19:03.309,"Uh, did you used to wear glasses?"
00:19:03.392,00:19:08.814,"No! I just got this awesome new coat of fur, and just in time for the Festival."
00:19:08.898,00:19:10.733,-It looks great. -It looks nice.
00:19:11.067,00:19:15.446,"Yeah, I get a new one every year, nice and thick for the winter."
00:19:15.780,00:19:19.158,Wait a second! I just realized something!
00:19:19.241,00:19:23.329,"The animals are doing different things, but all for the same reason."
00:19:23.412,00:19:25.748,That's right! They're getting ready for winter!
00:19:26.123,00:19:29.752,"If animals can tell winter's coming, maybe trees can, too."
00:19:31.962,00:19:38.094,"Yup! It says here a lot of trees lose their leaves in fall to prepare for a long, cold winter."
00:19:38.177,00:19:40.262,So Jack's definitely not sick.
00:19:40.346,00:19:42.306,He's just getting ready for winter!
00:19:42.390,00:19:44.433,Let's go find our Shining Star.
00:19:49.271,00:20:03.244,"I really had a lot of good ideas for the Fall Festival, you know, for if I ever got to be the Shining Star, and now I could do 'em, but only if you're feeling better."
00:20:05.246,00:20:06.205,Ah.
00:20:07.039,00:20:08.457,It's okay.
00:20:08.541,00:20:10.876,I'm not going anywhere.
00:20:13.671,00:20:18.509,"Jack needs to lose his leaves for winter, but he'll grow brand-new ones in the spring."
00:20:20.219,00:20:22.096,So Jack's not sick?
00:20:22.430,00:20:24.724,Nope. He's just preparing for winter.
00:20:25.057,00:20:26.434,-Really? -Yup.
00:20:26.517,00:20:32.481,"Jack isn't sick. He's just being a tree Oh, Jack, I'm so happy you're okay!"
00:20:32.857,00:20:36.110,This means it's time for me to be the Shining Star!
00:20:36.402,00:20:40.197,"Yes, so grab your plans, and let's get going."
00:20:40.281,00:20:42.241,We've got a tower to build.
00:21:09.310,00:21:12.605,Thank you all for making my dream come true!
00:21:16.942,00:21:26.202,"As you know, we all have a lot to be thankful for, most of all, our wonderful friends here in Acorn Springs."
00:21:26.535,00:21:34.251,"And now, in honor of the Fall Festival, my special tree friend Jack wanted to give us something extra special!"
00:21:41.675,00:21:45.638,It's time to go leaf jumping!
00:21:51.435,00:21:54.730,"Hey, everybody, say, Leaves!"
00:21:54.814,00:21:56.315,-Leaves! -Leaves!
00:22:00.402,00:22:04.323,"When we used the clues, we figured out Bean's tree wasn't sick at all."
00:22:04.657,00:22:08.911,That's right. He was just losing his leaves so he'd be ready for winter.
00:22:09.245,00:22:11.205,Time to close this case.
00:22:33.727,00:22:35.312,is officially closed.
00:00:33.367,00:00:43.168,LITTLE DETECTIVES TOBY &amp; TERI I'm so excited for this year's Downhill Dash.
00:00:43.252,00:00:49.716,"Me, too! It's amazing to think all the animals in Acorn Springs are making sleds right now."
00:00:50.048,00:00:51.802,Yeah! And soon it'll be time to race!
00:00:51.885,00:00:54.429,"I wanna win, so I'm painting feathers on my sled."
00:00:54.638,00:00:57.599,"You know, 'cause it's my sled, and feathers are fast!"
00:00:57.683,00:01:14.825,"Well, I'm painting a mural on mine, which you can admire Oh, yeah. Well, I put a brake on my sled, well, you know, 'cause fast is fun, but not too fast is really fun."
00:01:14.908,00:01:17.119,Wait. Where is Bean?
00:01:17.202,00:01:19.121,Isn't he gonna race this year?
00:01:21.711,00:01:25.085,I've been designing the fastest sled ever.
00:01:27.796,00:01:31.800,"I know it's my first sled, but I really want to win."
00:01:34.428,00:01:36.888,-'Scuse me! -Whaah!
00:01:41.435,00:01:43.145,Watch where you're going.
00:01:43.228,00:01:47.342,"I'm sorry about that. I only have one speed, fast."
00:01:47.542,00:01:50.277,"Actually, that's not true. I also have super fast."
00:01:50.360,00:01:52.779,You'll see that today in the Downhill Dash.
00:01:52.863,00:01:55.574,"Oh, where are my manners? I'm Ollie."
00:01:55.657,00:01:57.367,"-Hi, Ollie! -Hello!"
00:01:58.140,00:02:00.871,"Nice to meet you, Ollie. I'm Teri."
00:02:01.169,00:02:03.040,It's always nice to meet a fan.
00:02:03.123,00:02:05.792,"Of course I'll take a picture with you, Teri."
00:02:08.819,00:02:10.797,"Say, Ollie's the best."
00:02:13.676,00:02:17.012,"So, Ollie, are you racing in the Downhill Dash today?"
00:02:17.095,00:02:20.807,"Of course! But for the record, I don't race. I win."
00:02:20.891,00:02:23.226,I always win. I just can't help it.
00:02:23.630,00:02:29.983,"Well, you may be in for a surprise, 'cause I'm gonna build the fastest sled ever!"
00:02:30.372,00:02:35.614,"Oh! I'll wait. Go ahead, and finish this fastest sled ever, and we'll go for a practice run."
00:02:35.697,00:02:38.700,"Run, nothing. We'll race!"
00:02:41.244,00:02:43.705,"Okay, everybody ready?"
00:02:44.027,00:02:45.999,What a cute little sled.
00:02:52.881,00:02:55.509,Okay. Let's see what you got.
00:02:55.592,00:02:58.136,Ready. Set. Go!
00:03:05.227,00:03:08.021,"You're going so fast, you don't even look like you're moving!"
00:03:19.011,00:03:21.118,Good thing I got down here so fast.
00:03:21.201,00:03:25.080,"Otherwise, I would've missed all those cool somersaults you did the whole way down."
00:03:25.163,00:03:29.543,"Listen, I think I see some of my fans over there, so I've gotta go. I'll catch you guys later."
00:03:29.626,00:03:32.212,"Hey, everyone! Ollie's here!"
00:03:32.295,00:03:38.468,"I'm gonna make a faster sled for the Downhill Dash, and I'll beat you! You'll see!"
00:03:39.161,00:03:40.829,Are you okay?
00:03:41.138,00:03:42.389,Yes.
00:03:42.472,00:03:44.558,I know I can beat him.
00:03:45.025,00:03:47.644,I think you're gonna need something faster.
00:03:50.021,00:03:51.481,We'll all help.
00:03:54.526,00:03:58.280,So anyone know what makes a Super Sled super?
00:03:59.281,00:04:01.491,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:04:01.575,00:04:03.368,Will you excuse us?
00:04:10.250,00:04:15.297,We told Bean we'd help him build a Super Sled that's fast enough to beat Ollie in the Downhill Dash.
00:04:15.619,00:04:17.299,There's a lot at stake.
00:04:17.382,00:04:20.594,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:04:20.677,00:04:22.471,Let's do this!
00:04:50.542,00:04:53.710,So how are we gonna make me a Super Sled?
00:04:53.794,00:04:55.629,Look here at Rumy's.
00:04:55.712,00:04:58.590,"It has long, straight blades to slide on."
00:04:58.673,00:05:00.342,You're right!
00:05:03.303,00:05:06.264,The runners help the sled move.
00:05:06.348,00:05:11.102,"I totally want some of these, but thinner like my ice skates."
00:05:13.980,00:05:17.234,Good thinking! Let's get to work.
00:05:21.822,00:05:25.075,"Wow, a new sled. That was quick."
00:05:25.275,00:05:27.577,We all worked together to build it.
00:05:27.661,00:05:29.871,Oh! Your friends helped you?
00:05:29.955,00:05:34.543,"That's nice. I never need help with anything, because I'm just awesome on my own."
00:05:34.626,00:05:36.336,Wanna do another practice run?
00:05:36.600,00:05:40.674,"Oh, okay, but this is just going slow for fun."
00:05:40.757,00:05:44.177,I'm not really gonna race right now.
00:06:12.080,00:06:14.165,Too bad you left your sled behind.
00:06:14.249,00:06:17.919,"Well, it's almost time for the Downhill Dash, so I'd better get home."
00:06:18.003,00:06:20.422,"Trophy cases don't build themselves, you know."
00:06:24.690,00:06:26.540,"Yes, I'm fine."
00:06:26.845,00:06:29.014,So? What went wrong?
00:06:29.390,00:06:31.808,I think these runners may be too thin.
00:06:32.018,00:06:35.218,"When I push the sled, they just stick in the snow."
00:06:35.729,00:06:41.393,"But Bean goes really fast on his ice skates, and those blades look the same as these."
00:06:41.818,00:06:46.781,"On ice, the thin blades work well, but not in the soft snow."
00:06:46.865,00:06:52.162,"Look at Ollie. He's so great at sledding, he doesn't even need a sled."
00:06:54.080,00:06:56.333,River otters are the perfect sleds.
00:06:56.665,00:07:00.962,"They have long, flat bodies and thick, oily fur that's really, really smooth."
00:07:01.046,00:07:05.467,So let's use those same clues to design Bean a Snow Rocket.
00:07:05.689,00:07:07.469,I like that name!
00:07:07.552,00:07:09.763,Then let's get busy.
00:07:21.900,00:07:24.069,Whoa. That looks fast.
00:07:24.152,00:07:31.466,"I call it the Snow Rocket Friendship Zoom, 'cause it's fast, and my friends helped me build it."
00:07:31.576,00:07:33.912,You guys did all this for Bean?
00:07:34.109,00:07:35.914,Of course. That's what friends do.
00:07:35.997,00:07:41.086,"Yeah! Millie designed it, and Toby measured everything out, and then we all built it together!"
00:07:41.334,00:07:43.797,"Oh, and I painted this part right here."
00:07:43.880,00:07:46.758,Yeah! Helping Bean makes us happy!
00:07:49.649,00:07:51.930,"Racers, on your marks."
00:07:52.973,00:07:57.560,"And even though we're all going to race, we'll be cheering for you the whole way, Bean."
00:07:57.644,00:07:59.224,"Thanks, guys!"
00:07:59.849,00:08:01.439,Are you okay?
00:08:01.523,00:08:04.859,Yeah. I was so proud of how I didn't need any help.
00:08:05.157,00:08:07.654,But now I've got no one to cheer for me.
00:08:09.332,00:08:10.907,"I'll cheer for you, Ollie."
00:08:11.908,00:08:15.537,"I'll still beat you, but I'll cheer you all the way down."
00:08:16.913,00:08:18.581,You're on.
00:08:19.708,00:08:22.771,On your marks. Get set.
00:08:24.629,00:08:26.006,Go!
00:08:45.391,00:08:49.279,"Go, Ollie! Yay!"
00:08:49.362,00:08:51.641,Here I come!
00:09:01.875,00:09:03.168,"Oh, no!"
00:09:07.227,00:09:09.841,"Oh, no. No! No!"
00:09:17.766,00:09:19.225,Need a hand?
00:09:20.732,00:09:23.188,Really? Thanks!
00:09:31.112,00:09:32.989,"All right, you're all set."
00:09:33.114,00:09:34.365,Thanks for your help!
00:09:34.449,00:09:36.117,Now let's get moving!
00:09:36.201,00:09:37.452,Okay!
00:09:40.413,00:09:43.124,"Uh, okay. Okay."
00:09:45.043,00:09:47.170,Huh-yah!
00:09:55.512,00:09:59.808,And the winner of the Downhill Dash is Rumy!
00:09:59.891,00:10:03.228,Me? I won?
00:10:03.724,00:10:05.563,You did! You won!
00:10:05.849,00:10:08.399,I won! I won a trophy!
00:10:08.483,00:10:11.820,It's just such a wonderful world!
00:10:19.452,00:10:22.831,"Bean, Ollie, look! I won!"
00:10:22.914,00:10:25.458,"That's great, Rumy! Did you see us?"
00:10:25.625,00:10:27.919,"I got stuck, but Ollie stopped to help me."
00:10:28.044,00:10:29.838,That was really nice of you.
00:10:29.921,00:10:32.382,And you're not upset you didn't win?
00:10:34.592,00:10:37.595,Stopping to help Bean felt even better than winning.
00:10:37.679,00:10:40.557,"Besides, I'll win next time."
00:10:42.642,00:10:45.103,Come on! Let's not wait 'til next year.
00:10:45.186,00:10:46.437,Let's go again!
00:10:46.521,00:10:48.606,"-Yeah! -Yeah, let's do it!"
00:10:48.690,00:10:53.069,"But first, smile and say, Super Sled!"
00:10:53.153,00:10:54.821,-Super Sled! -Super Sled!
00:10:58.346,00:11:02.662,We figured out how to make Bean a Super Sled that went super fast.
00:11:02.745,00:11:07.125,And Ollie learned that having friends is more important than winning.
00:11:32.150,00:11:33.776,is officially closed!
00:11:47.415,00:11:49.751,Aha! I see you!
00:11:50.123,00:11:52.795,"Uh, I see you, too, Rumy."
00:11:52.879,00:11:55.131,"Oh, uh, sorry, Millie."
00:11:55.215,00:11:56.841,I'm actually talking to Bean.
00:11:56.925,00:12:05.642,"Oh, Bean's not-- We're practicing for the big hide-and-seek championship."
00:12:06.100,00:12:08.603,"Oh, that's right. I almost forgot."
00:12:10.897,00:12:12.357,We do it every year.
00:12:12.639,00:12:14.567,And it's so much fun!
00:12:14.839,00:12:16.964,Now I just need to find Jay.
00:12:20.314,00:12:23.076,Do clouds usually have feet?
00:12:23.660,00:12:25.286,Gotcha! It's me!
00:12:25.370,00:12:26.537,"Pretty good, right?"
00:12:28.581,00:12:30.208,You're really good at this.
00:12:30.291,00:12:33.586,I had to up my game to try to beat Erwin the Ermine this year.
00:12:33.670,00:12:35.213,"Uh, I don't know."
00:12:35.296,00:12:37.799,Erwin's the best hide-and-seeker around.
00:12:38.180,00:12:41.386,He's won the championship every fall!
00:12:49.686,00:12:52.313,Look. You can barely see him.
00:12:52.397,00:12:53.898,"Oh, he is good."
00:12:54.160,00:12:58.653,"Lots of things in Acorn Springs are brown like Erwin, so he can hide anywhere."
00:13:02.875,00:13:04.425,"Hey, guys!"
00:13:05.975,00:13:09.706,"Uh, E-Erwin? Is that you?"
00:13:10.025,00:13:12.333,Of course. Who else would it be?
00:13:12.417,00:13:15.128,I can't wait to play hide-and-seek with you all.
00:13:15.605,00:13:19.507,Check out some of my new moves for this year. I call this...
00:13:21.718,00:13:23.803,blend into the bark.
00:13:25.722,00:13:27.471,And don't forget this one...
00:13:27.807,00:13:29.392,rocking the rock.
00:13:30.810,00:13:34.272,"When it comes to hiding, I'm down with anything brown."
00:13:39.152,00:13:41.946,"Uh, you know your fur is white, right?"
00:13:43.466,00:13:47.493,"I guess it's been getting a little lighter, but not so much you'd notice."
00:13:53.691,00:13:55.293,"Okay, a lot."
00:13:55.472,00:13:58.880,"Actually you're so white, you don't blend in with anything."
00:13:58.963,00:14:00.715,Except a mountain of marshmallows. Ooh!
00:14:00.798,00:14:03.259,You'd be great at hiding in a mountain of marshmallows.
00:14:03.343,00:14:05.470,Or a pile of powdered sugar!
00:14:05.553,00:14:08.348,Or really awesome pretend clouds!
00:14:08.431,00:14:11.434,"Wait. Uh, I don't blend in with anything?"
00:14:11.517,00:14:14.520,What happened? Why did my fur turn white?
00:14:14.920,00:14:17.899,"I don't know, but I know who can find out."
00:14:17.982,00:14:20.193,Toby and Teri. Come on.
00:14:26.074,00:14:28.201,I've never seen anything like it.
00:14:28.284,00:14:30.536,You guys just gotta help Erwin.
00:14:30.620,00:14:34.415,He's the hide-and-seek champion. He's gotta play!
00:14:35.208,00:14:37.293,I don't know if I can play like this.
00:14:37.377,00:14:40.755,What am I gonna do? I can't blend into anything.
00:14:40.838,00:14:43.174,We'll figure this out. I promise.
00:14:43.257,00:14:45.593,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:14:45.676,00:14:46.886,Will you excuse us?
00:14:46.969,00:14:49.097,To the treehouse!
00:14:55.603,00:14:59.482,"Now that Erwin's fur is white, he doesn't blend in with anything."
00:14:59.565,00:15:03.152,Which means he can't play in the hide-and-seek championship this year.
00:15:03.236,00:15:04.362,There's a lot at stake.
00:15:04.654,00:15:07.448,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:15:07.532,00:15:09.209,Let's do this!
00:15:38.312,00:15:39.981,There's a reason your fur is white.
00:15:40.064,00:15:42.483,And we're going to figure out what it is.
00:15:42.567,00:15:45.851,"Erwin, I'm gonna need to ask you some questions."
00:15:46.028,00:15:47.989,Have you eaten anything white lately?
00:15:49.449,00:15:52.034,No. I don't eat sweets.
00:15:52.118,00:15:53.202,What about milk?
00:15:55.788,00:15:59.417,"But we drink milk, too, and our fur isn't white."
00:15:59.500,00:16:01.586,Did you maybe roll in something white?
00:16:05.887,00:16:07.717,"No, I haven't done anything different."
00:16:07.800,00:16:09.594,What am I going to do?
00:16:09.677,00:16:10.970,"Don't worry, Erwin."
00:16:11.053,00:16:13.764,"If we follow the facts, we'll crack this case."
00:16:13.848,00:16:15.641,We're going to look for clues.
00:16:15.725,00:16:19.270,There has to be other things that have changed in Acorn Springs.
00:16:22.231,00:16:24.264,And we'll be back.
00:16:26.694,00:16:31.657,"While Toby and Teri are cracking this case, we're gonna teach you new ways to hide."
00:16:31.741,00:16:33.659,-Really? -Yup!
00:16:33.743,00:16:37.705,Millie's Academy of the Hide-and-Seek Sciences is now open.
00:16:37.788,00:16:41.042,"Now lesson one, scrunching."
00:16:41.125,00:16:43.294,"Rumy, if you don't mind?"
00:16:45.046,00:16:50.134,"As you'll notice, the subject scrunches and is suddenly very hard to find."
00:16:50.635,00:16:52.929,"Whoa, good one."
00:16:56.896,00:16:59.435,So why did Erwin's fur turn white?
00:16:59.519,00:17:02.522,"I wonder if anything else is changing color, too."
00:17:04.696,00:17:07.171,Hmm. The leaves!
00:17:07.401,00:17:14.367,"They're green in the spring and summer, but they turn red and yellow every fall right before they fall off the trees."
00:17:17.453,00:17:21.958,"Fall came. Leaves change, falling off tree. Got it!"
00:17:22.041,00:17:24.210,Let's see what else has changed.
00:17:25.586,00:17:28.464,"Okay, let's try one more time."
00:17:28.750,00:17:31.884,"Ready, set, scrunch!"
00:17:36.097,00:17:39.934,The trick to good scrunching is to tuck everything in.
00:17:40.381,00:17:42.895,Got it! How's this?
00:17:42.979,00:17:44.756,I can see your head.
00:17:55.449,00:17:56.367,Whoops!
00:17:56.450,00:17:59.114,Whoa! Ohh! Aah!
00:18:00.364,00:18:03.082,Are you okay? That looks splooshy.
00:18:03.165,00:18:05.585,I'm fine. I just fell in the mud.
00:18:06.364,00:18:10.256,"Hey, if Erwin was covered with mud, he'd be all brown again."
00:18:17.263,00:18:18.931,You should roll in it.
00:18:19.015,00:18:20.516,Yeah!
00:18:32.987,00:18:33.988,Rocco!
00:18:37.116,00:18:39.285,"Hey, guys. Check it out!"
00:18:39.505,00:18:43.539,I'm working on my Furry Pika Split Jump with a spin.
00:18:51.380,00:18:53.341,"Wow, that was impressive."
00:18:53.424,00:18:55.926,Thanks. It's my signature move.
00:18:57.011,00:18:59.055,Hey! The pond is frozen.
00:18:59.138,00:19:00.723,It happened last night.
00:19:00.806,00:19:03.893,"Yesterday this was all water, and now ice."
00:19:03.976,00:19:05.478,You guys on a case?
00:19:05.561,00:19:09.649,Yeah. We were looking around to see what's changed in Acorn Springs.
00:19:09.732,00:19:13.319,And I think a frozen pond is exactly what we're looking for.
00:19:16.541,00:19:19.200,Definitely. A lot of things have changed.
00:19:19.591,00:19:23.691,"All the leaves have fallen off the trees, and the pond is frozen."
00:19:23.996,00:19:25.915,You know what else is changing?
00:19:25.998,00:19:27.708,The seasons! It's winter now.
00:19:27.792,00:19:29.794,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
00:19:30.116,00:19:32.797,That Rocco is really graceful?
00:19:32.880,00:19:34.423,You read my mind.
00:19:36.676,00:19:39.095,but we're talking about Erwin the Ermine.
00:19:39.178,00:19:41.597,We think we know why he turned white.
00:19:41.681,00:19:43.474,"We gotta go. Great skating, Rocco."
00:19:43.557,00:19:44.975,And thanks for the help.
00:19:45.059,00:19:47.103,Anytime! See ya!
00:19:52.400,00:19:55.528,Look at me! I'm brown again.
00:19:55.611,00:19:57.238,You're good as new.
00:19:57.321,00:20:00.250,Guys! We've got some good news.
00:20:03.411,00:20:05.788,Just in time for our hide-and-seek championship.
00:20:06.664,00:20:07.790,Is that mud?
00:20:07.873,00:20:10.376,Yeah. Now I can hide anywhere.
00:20:10.459,00:20:14.046,Check out the old exact same color as the ground maneuver!
00:20:17.842,00:20:21.470,in a sort of I-can-see-you way.
00:20:21.554,00:20:25.180,How can you see me? I'm brown again.
00:20:25.705,00:20:27.268,And now the mud's coming off.
00:20:27.351,00:20:30.896,I'm not gonna be able to play in the championship after all.
00:20:31.021,00:20:36.155,"It's okay. You're supposed to be white, just like everything in Acorn Springs."
00:20:38.696,00:20:42.700,"Because winter's here, and now you're the color of snow."
00:20:48.289,00:20:51.208,Wow! You're right!
00:20:52.835,00:20:57.590,Ermines like you are one of the few animals whose fur changes color each winter.
00:20:58.674,00:21:00.593,We gotta get you white again.
00:21:00.676,00:21:05.514,Yeah! You've got a hide-and-seek championship to win!
00:21:07.308,00:21:09.018,All right!
00:21:10.750,00:21:15.816,"Look, everybody! The whole world is the same color as Erwin!"
00:21:25.451,00:21:27.787,Erwin blends into everything!
00:21:31.499,00:21:34.835,Look! The champ is back.
00:21:34.919,00:21:37.213,Who wants to try to find me?
00:21:37.296,00:21:39.965,I do! I do! Can I count first?
00:21:40.049,00:21:40.925,Sure!
00:21:41.008,00:21:43.761,Then I'm going to find Erwin!
00:21:47.181,00:21:48.641,"Oh, yeah! You're right!"
00:21:48.724,00:21:50.226,-That's right! -Let's go!
00:21:51.060,00:21:54.688,"Hey, everybody, say, Hide-and-seek!"
00:21:55.147,00:21:56.732,-Hide-and-seek! -Hide-and-seek!
00:22:00.778,00:22:04.031,We finally figured out why Erwin's fur turned white.
00:22:04.114,00:22:08.327,"And now that he blends into the snow, he can be hide-and-seek champion again."
00:22:33.060,00:22:34.645,is officially closed.
00:00:33.427,00:00:44.127,LITTLE DETECTIVES TOBY &amp; TERI I call this first trick picking summer flowers.
00:00:49.758,00:00:51.760,"Oh, that's beautiful, Jay."
00:00:51.843,00:00:56.890,I think your Summer Spectacular show is gonna be the best flying show you've ever done.
00:00:56.974,00:01:02.104,Thanks. Every one of my flying stunts is about what makes summer so great.
00:01:02.187,00:01:06.358,I call this one watching the summer clouds go by.
00:01:09.236,00:01:11.989,It looks like snow.
00:01:14.074,00:01:15.784,Does it snow in the summer?
00:01:15.951,00:01:21.123,"No. If it's snowing, that means summer is over and so is fall."
00:01:21.206,00:01:23.292,"If it's snowing, it must be winter."
00:01:26.962,00:01:28.505,All my tricks are about summer.
00:01:28.630,00:01:30.716,"If it's winter, I can't do my show!"
00:01:30.841,00:01:32.801,This doesn't make any sense.
00:01:32.884,00:01:34.761,I know. What do we do?
00:01:34.886,00:01:37.723,Come on. We better find Toby and Teri.
00:01:44.605,00:01:45.606,Mm-hmm.
00:01:45.731,00:01:48.984,"Jay, look. It's not snowing here."
00:01:49.067,00:01:51.069,It shouldn't be snowing anywhere.
00:01:54.156,00:01:56.450,See? We're picking strawberries.
00:01:56.533,00:02:00.287,Hey aren't you getting ready for your Summer Spectacular?
00:02:01.371,00:02:03.457,"I was, but now I'm not."
00:02:03.582,00:02:05.542,"Oh, no. Why not?"
00:02:05.626,00:02:07.044,Because it's not summer.
00:02:07.169,00:02:14.718,"How is it not summer? The sun is out, the grass is green, and-- Is that snow?"
00:02:21.767,00:02:24.061,"-Oh. Sorry, Jay. -Yeah. Sorry."
00:02:24.144,00:02:27.356,And my Summer Spectacular was all about summer things.
00:02:27.439,00:02:29.941,It's not going to make much sense if it's winter.
00:02:30.025,00:02:32.361,But it's too soon for winter.
00:02:32.444,00:02:34.905,Winter isn't supposed to be here 'til...
00:02:34.988,00:02:37.199,"wintertime, and it's summer."
00:02:37.282,00:02:39.326,"But there it is, snow."
00:02:39.409,00:02:43.080,"Snow that shouldn't be falling, but is falling."
00:02:43.163,00:02:45.040,We've gotta find out why.
00:02:45.123,00:02:47.125,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:02:47.250,00:02:48.710,Will you excuse us?
00:02:48.794,00:02:50.754,To the treehouse!
00:02:56.218,00:02:59.471,Jay's been planning his Summer Spectacular for weeks.
00:02:59.596,00:03:03.350,"But if it really is snowing, he can't do a show about summer."
00:03:03.433,00:03:05.894,We gotta figure out what's happening.
00:03:08.105,00:03:10.899,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:03:10.982,00:03:12.693,Let's do this.
00:03:43.974,00:03:45.475,So let's follow the facts.
00:03:45.600,00:03:50.522,"We know it's summer, because-- Let's see. It's a beautiful, warm day."
00:03:50.605,00:03:52.524,And there's a butterfly.
00:03:52.607,00:03:54.568,They're not out during the winter.
00:03:54.651,00:03:56.862,And we were just picking strawberries.
00:03:56.945,00:04:00.949,"But it's snowing, which is definitely something that happens in the winter."
00:04:01.032,00:04:02.534,What else happens in the winter?
00:04:02.617,00:04:04.536,It gets dark really early.
00:04:04.619,00:04:06.455,And we go sledding.
00:04:06.538,00:04:08.039,And ice skating.
00:04:08.123,00:04:12.878,Of course. The pond freezes over in the winter so we can go ice skating.
00:04:12.961,00:04:17.048,"Yes, so if the pond is frozen, we can go skating today."
00:04:20.761,00:04:23.305,Let's go get our skates and hats.
00:04:23.388,00:04:25.056,It's cold when you skate.
00:04:25.140,00:04:26.683,But what about my show?
00:04:26.767,00:04:29.269,Everything I came up with was about summer.
00:04:29.352,00:04:32.606,Maybe your show can be about ice skating?
00:04:32.689,00:04:34.483,But I don't know how to skate.
00:04:34.566,00:04:36.818,It's okay. We'll show you.
00:04:36.902,00:04:40.322,It could be part of a new show all about winter.
00:04:40.405,00:04:42.949,"Ah, I guess I can try."
00:04:43.033,00:04:45.660,It'll be great. You'll see.
00:04:45.744,00:04:47.871,Let's go get our skates.
00:04:52.876,00:04:55.128,We better take a look at the pond.
00:04:55.253,00:04:58.215,"Yeah, if it really did suddenly turn into winter..."
00:04:58.340,00:05:00.509,We'll have a frozen pond for sure.
00:05:05.889,00:05:08.225,"Flowers don't grow in winter, right?"
00:05:09.434,00:05:10.811,These flowers don't.
00:05:10.894,00:05:12.103,And look at the pond.
00:05:16.900,00:05:18.944,What? It's not?
00:05:19.027,00:05:20.946,Not even a little bit.
00:05:21.029,00:05:22.447,But that means we can't skate.
00:05:22.531,00:05:24.324,"And if we can't skate, it's not winter."
00:05:24.407,00:05:26.952,"So if it's not winter, I can do my Summer Spectacular."
00:05:27.077,00:05:28.870,"Oh, I'm really confused."
00:05:29.037,00:05:32.207,And I'm really hot in my scarf.
00:05:32.332,00:05:37.629,"Sure you are, because it's not cold, which is why the pond is not frozen."
00:05:37.712,00:05:39.756,"You're right, and that's a clue."
00:05:39.840,00:05:50.183,"It has to be cold for the pond to freeze and for it to snow, but it's warm, a warm, beautiful day full of singing birds and colorful flowers."
00:05:50.308,00:05:57.357,"If we follow the facts, it sure seems like summer, so the snow is the one piece that doesn't fit."
00:05:57.440,00:06:00.110,"But there it is, snow."
00:06:01.611,00:06:04.656,"Jay, why don't you do a snow show?"
00:06:04.739,00:06:08.118,You could call it Jay's Snowy Spectacular.
00:06:12.038,00:06:15.166,"But there's a whole lot of fun winter stuff, too."
00:06:15.292,00:06:19.129,Snow is lots of fun. There are snowmen.
00:06:19.254,00:06:21.256,And snow angels.
00:06:21.339,00:06:23.133,And snowballs.
00:06:23.258,00:06:30.223,"I can see it. Jay's Snowy Spectacular, and I'll begin it with a super snowflake spiral."
00:06:30.348,00:06:31.433,Let's go!
00:06:32.684,00:06:34.060,-Yo! -Come on!
00:06:35.270,00:06:38.231,It's time you and I gave this snow a closer look.
00:06:38.315,00:06:40.692,Sounds good to me. Come on.
00:06:44.696,00:06:45.780,Wow!
00:06:45.864,00:06:47.490,Look at all this snow.
00:06:47.574,00:06:53.955,"There's enough here for a million forts, a zillion snowballs, and a whole city of snowmen."
00:06:54.080,00:06:56.625,And I'll create tricks for every one of them.
00:06:56.750,00:07:00.754,Watch. I'll begin with the Snowman Cancan.
00:07:04.424,00:07:05.926,"That's great, Jay."
00:07:06.051,00:07:08.178,We'll build a snowman you can dance with.
00:07:08.303,00:07:10.555,The best snowman ever.
00:07:10.680,00:07:17.812,I'm a snowman building expert. You always start by making a great big ball of snow for the body.
00:07:17.938,00:07:19.481,Sounds good to me.
00:07:23.485,00:07:24.694,Oh.
00:07:24.778,00:07:26.237,Let me help you.
00:07:26.321,00:07:27.489,"Me, too."
00:07:27.572,00:07:32.827,"Just gather it up with your hand, and roll the snow into a ball like this."
00:07:34.162,00:07:36.623,"Uh, hold on."
00:07:36.706,00:07:38.208,This is going to work.
00:07:43.421,00:07:44.756,It didn't work.
00:07:47.676,00:07:50.971,This snow doesn't make snowmen. That's a clue.
00:07:51.096,00:07:53.807,It doesn't really do anything that snow does.
00:07:55.058,00:07:59.688,"It's not cold, and when I rub the snowflake, it should melt."
00:08:06.820,00:08:09.614,Snowflakes don't have little brown spots.
00:08:09.698,00:08:11.950,I don't think these are snowflakes.
00:08:13.910,00:08:16.287,It's white and fluffy and falling from the sky.
00:08:16.371,00:08:18.915,Teri's right. This snow isn't cold.
00:08:19.040,00:08:22.335,"And it's supposed to fall from clouds, but look."
00:08:22.460,00:08:24.838,There's not a cloud in the sky.
00:08:26.214,00:08:31.469,"You're right. This snow is blowing in on the wind, and it's all coming from over there."
00:08:32.262,00:08:35.682,"Then that's the way we're going. Come on, everybody!"
00:08:42.063,00:08:44.733,It's snowing really hard!
00:08:44.816,00:08:47.444,We should turn back!
00:08:47.527,00:08:50.822,No! Keep going!
00:08:50.905,00:08:53.158,Why are you all yelling?
00:08:54.826,00:08:58.038,"You're supposed to yell in snowstorms, aren't you?"
00:08:58.121,00:09:00.665,I don't think this is a snowstorm.
00:09:11.551,00:09:12.510,I can't believe it.
00:09:12.594,00:09:14.429,You guys made it summer again.
00:09:14.554,00:09:18.099,"All we did was follow the facts, and they brought us here."
00:09:19.142,00:09:22.228,"Just as I suspected, it's not winter yet."
00:09:22.353,00:09:26.399,Each of these snowflakes is carrying a seed from these cottonwood trees.
00:09:26.483,00:09:29.110,Remember those brown spots Toby found?
00:09:29.194,00:09:30.445,Those are the seeds.
00:09:30.528,00:09:33.490,So what's all the white stuff for?
00:09:33.573,00:09:40.413,The cottony bit makes the seed float so the wind can carry them to new places to make new cottonwood trees.
00:09:40.497,00:09:44.000,So this isn't real snow. It's summer snow.
00:09:46.169,00:09:48.505,Cottonwood trees only do this in summer.
00:09:53.218,00:09:55.011,Yippee!
00:09:59.557,00:10:01.351,Prepare to be amazed.
00:10:01.434,00:10:07.774,"Presenting Jay's Summer Spectacular, starring Jay!"
00:10:12.529,00:10:19.994,Thank you. The first act of my Summer Spectacular is called ode to the fluffy cottonwood seeds of summer.
00:10:34.717,00:10:36.803,"All right, Jay!"
00:10:46.187,00:10:48.731,"Say, Snowflakes!"
00:10:48.815,00:10:50.316,-Snowflakes! -Snowflakes!
00:10:54.571,00:10:56.823,These sure look like snowflakes.
00:10:56.906,00:10:59.659,But it shouldn't have been snowing on a summer day.
00:11:02.495,00:11:06.499,Until we followed the facts straight to the cottonwood trees.
00:11:06.624,00:11:09.294,Time to close this case.
00:11:32.372,00:11:34.235,is officially closed.
00:11:44.996,00:11:46.748,Where is everybody?
00:11:50.376,00:11:53.213,Millie's Acorn Springs Band is ready for rehearsal.
00:11:53.338,00:11:57.342,"One bagpipe ready to, um..."
00:11:57.425,00:11:58.343,pipe.
00:12:01.429,00:12:02.889,I've got my violin.
00:12:18.529,00:12:20.573,And I'm ready with my maracas.
00:12:20.657,00:12:25.453,Perfect. Now there's nothing keeping us from fame and fortune except...
00:12:26.621,00:12:28.498,Rumy. Where is he?
00:12:28.623,00:12:30.124,Here I am.
00:12:31.125,00:12:32.752,Where's your instrument?
00:12:32.835,00:12:35.338,I don't have one.
00:12:35.463,00:12:38.383,That's okay. You don't need an instrument.
00:12:41.469,00:12:42.679,Why don't you try that?
00:12:42.762,00:12:44.389,Ha! Really?
00:12:44.472,00:12:46.599,"Oh, that's a great idea."
00:12:46.683,00:12:49.185,Okay. Let's see how it sounds.
00:12:49.310,00:12:50.478,From the top.
00:12:50.561,00:12:52.981,And one and two and...
00:13:05.910,00:13:08.204,That did not sound good.
00:13:08.288,00:13:11.374,"Uh, you know what? I-I can just listen."
00:13:11.457,00:13:13.418,"Th-That'll be fun, too."
00:13:13.543,00:13:16.921,No. This band is for everyone.
00:13:17.005,00:13:21.175,"Toby, Teri, do you think you can make something for Rumy to play?"
00:13:21.301,00:13:25.305,"Sure we can, if we can figure out how instruments make sound."
00:13:25.388,00:13:27.807,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:13:27.932,00:13:29.517,Will you excuse us?
00:13:29.600,00:13:31.769,To the treehouse!
00:13:41.154,00:13:45.575,"I wonder, how we can get things like this leaf and stick to make music?"
00:13:45.658,00:13:50.955,It's a mystery that we've gotta figure out so we can make Rumy an amazing instrument all his own.
00:13:51.080,00:13:54.792,"If we don't, Rumy can't be in the band."
00:13:54.876,00:13:56.669,There's a lot at stake.
00:13:56.794,00:13:59.881,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:14:00.006,00:14:01.883,Let's do this.
00:14:31.518,00:14:33.426,"Great, move it over there."
00:14:36.501,00:14:38.086,how are you?
00:14:40.296,00:14:42.757,We've got to get our dam ready for the winter.
00:14:42.840,00:14:44.634,"So, what can I do you for?"
00:14:44.759,00:14:48.679,Toby and Teri are going to make me a musical instrument.
00:14:48.805,00:14:53.476,"If you guys have detailed plans, we can build you whatever you want."
00:14:53.601,00:14:55.603,Do you guys ever make music?
00:14:55.728,00:14:58.898,That's all we do when we're not building things.
00:14:58.981,00:14:59.982,Check it out.
00:15:00.066,00:15:03.903,"Hey, guys, let's play 'em something snappy!"
00:15:09.700,00:15:11.869,I love this sound.
00:15:11.953,00:15:14.455,Oh ho! This is great!
00:15:16.791,00:15:20.420,Yeah! That's why I love playing drums!
00:15:25.633,00:15:26.717,What?
00:15:30.805,00:15:33.307,I need to find something else.
00:15:40.273,00:15:42.024,It's a hollow stick.
00:15:42.108,00:15:45.361,"If you put pebbles in it, you can make it rattle."
00:15:47.905,00:15:50.575,Ah! That's pretty neat.
00:15:50.658,00:15:52.952,But that's the sound my maracas make.
00:15:56.497,00:15:58.708,"Oh, you're right."
00:15:58.833,00:16:02.420,So is there something else I can play?
00:16:02.503,00:16:05.756,The beavers's tails were like Bean's drum...
00:16:05.882,00:16:09.969,and the hollow stick sounded just like Jay's maracas.
00:16:10.094,00:16:13.347,We have to find Rumy a brand-new way to make music.
00:16:16.017,00:16:17.894,How about a sound like that?
00:16:18.019,00:16:22.190,Yeah. That's awesome! Where's that coming from?
00:16:23.191,00:16:26.110,"Hi, everybody. What's going on?"
00:16:26.194,00:16:29.989,Toby and Teri are going to make me a musical instrument.
00:16:30.072,00:16:32.783,Maybe one that does what you just did.
00:16:32.867,00:16:33.951,Uhh!
00:16:34.035,00:16:35.953,How did you make that sound?
00:16:36.037,00:16:38.498,It was the loudest thing I've ever heard.
00:16:38.581,00:16:42.043,I don't think I could do that if I tried. Ohhh!
00:16:42.168,00:16:45.254,The trick is to fill your lungs like a balloon.
00:16:46.631,00:16:48.758,Then let it out through your nose.
00:17:01.145,00:17:02.313,What's wrong?
00:17:02.396,00:17:10.154,"The Acorn Springs Band already has an instrument that makes moose sounds, your bagpipes."
00:17:11.113,00:17:12.114,You're right.
00:17:12.198,00:17:15.117,That's okay. We'll just try something else.
00:17:15.201,00:17:18.996,Can you think of anyone around here who also makes music?
00:17:19.121,00:17:21.332,You should talk to the crickets.
00:17:21.415,00:17:23.834,I love the sounds they make.
00:17:24.961,00:17:27.505,Crickets make beautiful music.
00:17:27.588,00:17:31.509,I always hear crickets over here in the tall grass.
00:17:34.720,00:17:36.681,Hey! Here's one.
00:17:38.432,00:17:39.767,"Hello, little cricket."
00:17:39.892,00:17:43.104,She makes music by rubbing her legs together.
00:17:43.187,00:17:44.730,Can you do that again?
00:17:48.484,00:17:50.861,That's what makes the music.
00:17:55.283,00:17:57.285,My violin works the same way.
00:17:57.368,00:18:00.746,"I pull the bow across the strings, and they make music."
00:18:01.581,00:18:08.629,"So even if I could do that with my legs, we've already got that sound in the band."
00:18:09.380,00:18:12.508,"Don't worry, Rumy. We won't give up."
00:18:12.592,00:18:16.470,"And using the clues we've got so far, I've got an idea."
00:18:16.596,00:18:20.600,I've got a sound that isn't like anything in The Acorn Springs Band.
00:18:23.477,00:18:28.149,"I come here sometimes to think, and I always listen to the wind."
00:18:29.066,00:18:31.193,That's a great sound.
00:18:34.864,00:18:38.034,Whoooo!
00:18:44.665,00:18:46.375,I give up.
00:18:52.548,00:18:55.593,"Wait! Rumy, did you hear that?"
00:19:01.724,00:19:03.809,Let's follow the facts.
00:19:03.934,00:19:05.227,The wind is blowing...
00:19:06.520,00:19:08.648,and the tree is hollow.
00:19:08.731,00:19:14.320,"And every time Rumy sits down, he covers one of the holes in the log."
00:19:26.332,00:19:28.376,Oh! You guys wanna try?
00:19:28.501,00:19:30.419,-Sure! -Sure!
00:19:49.021,00:19:50.231,"What is it, Rumy?"
00:19:50.314,00:19:58.322,"This is great, but it's too big to move, so I don't have an instrument again."
00:19:58.406,00:20:05.871,"Toby, now that we know how the log makes music, can you make Rumy something just like it, but smaller?"
00:20:08.332,00:20:09.458,Sure.
00:20:12.294,00:20:14.463,Can you make some holes in this?
00:20:14.547,00:20:18.843,A big one here and a bunch of little ones along here.
00:20:27.893,00:20:29.228,Thanks.
00:20:29.311,00:20:33.107,"Now just blow across here, like you were the wind."
00:20:33.190,00:20:35.317,Okay.
00:20:41.824,00:20:43.200,Hey!
00:20:45.703,00:20:47.788,And it's a sound all your own.
00:21:54.230,00:21:56.190,"Say, Music!"
00:21:56.273,00:21:57.566,-Music! -Music!
00:22:01.278,00:22:05.074,We helped our friend be a part of the Acorn Springs Band.
00:22:05.199,00:22:08.077,And we learned a new way to make a musical instrument.
00:22:08.244,00:22:10.412,Time to close this case.
00:22:33.908,00:22:35.391,is officially closed.
00:00:33.635,00:00:51.301,"LITTLE DETECTIVES TOBY &amp; TERI A trip to the beach always means a yummy lunch, and when lunch is over, this is the very best part!"
00:00:51.385,00:00:55.305,That's right. Time for another legendary adventure.
00:00:55.389,00:00:56.974,Of the oceanic...
00:01:00.727,00:01:02.854,It was a windy day.
00:01:02.938,00:01:13.865,"A boatload of bunnies was sailing the seas when suddenly out of the water rose five angry shark sisters, and they were hungry for bunnies."
00:01:13.949,00:01:15.742,Let's act it out.
00:01:19.496,00:01:21.331,Hah! I'm a growly shark.
00:01:21.415,00:01:23.542,And I'm a whole bunch of bunnies.
00:01:25.586,00:01:27.337,I mean us! Help the bunnies!
00:01:27.421,00:01:30.424,And that's just what BigFin did.
00:01:30.507,00:01:35.429,"She swam right up to those big, bad shark sisters and roared."
00:01:35.512,00:01:37.389,Roar!
00:01:37.472,00:01:44.104,"The shark sisters were so afraid of BigFin's mighty roar, they turned immediately to stone."
00:01:50.402,00:01:52.863,That's me turning to stone.
00:01:52.946,00:01:57.534,"And the bunnies were safe to sail away, all because of BigFin."
00:01:59.244,00:02:06.627,"They call these stories tall tales, 'cause they stretch the truth, but there's always something a little real in them."
00:02:10.547,00:02:14.092,Then we should totally find out if BigFin is really real.
00:02:14.176,00:02:16.928,I wish we could go on an ocean adventure.
00:02:17.012,00:02:19.348,That would be amazing. Can we?
00:02:19.431,00:02:21.475,An oceangoing mystery.
00:02:24.102,00:02:26.521,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:02:28.190,00:02:30.067,To the treehouse!
00:02:35.572,00:02:38.492,Animals have been telling BigFin stories for years.
00:02:39.201,00:02:40.952,So why has no one ever found her?
00:02:41.036,00:02:49.044,"I guess they didn't know where to look, but if we use the clues in the stories, we can finally find out if BigFin's really real."
00:02:51.088,00:02:54.508,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:02:54.591,00:02:56.259,Let's do this.
00:03:25.622,00:03:29.209,"If BigFin's out there, she'll be in the water for sure."
00:03:29.292,00:03:31.211,Which means we need a boat.
00:03:31.294,00:03:34.339,"Lucky for us, Commodore Barry said we could use his."
00:03:34.423,00:03:35.757,Isn't it great?
00:03:38.218,00:03:43.014,Even thinking about sailing makes my tummy do flip-flops.
00:03:45.267,00:03:47.686,"Hey, you and I can be mission control."
00:03:47.769,00:03:52.649,"I'll watch Commodore Barry's satellite system, and you can be in charge of communication."
00:03:52.733,00:03:56.570,Yeah. Just radio the information to Search Team Alpha.
00:03:56.653,00:03:58.155,That's us.
00:04:00.198,00:04:03.994,Roger. A-okay. 10-4. Gotcha.
00:04:08.790,00:04:13.462,Let's start with the story Millie read where BigFin turned the shark sisters to stone.
00:04:13.545,00:04:14.963,Is there a clue there?
00:04:15.046,00:04:17.215,You can't really turn anybody to stone.
00:04:17.299,00:04:21.428,"But Toby said there's a little truth in all these stories, right?"
00:04:21.511,00:04:25.974,Right. So maybe we're looking for stones that look like sharks.
00:04:26.057,00:04:29.770,"But are they shaped like sharks when they growl, grr, or go chomp?"
00:04:29.853,00:04:33.440,We'll know when we see them. Let's see what Millie can find.
00:04:40.739,00:04:43.450,"Hey, did you just hear someone giggle?"
00:04:45.619,00:04:50.040,"No, but thinking about giggling makes me giggle."
00:04:52.334,00:04:54.169,Hmm.
00:04:57.255,00:05:00.258,Teri said they were looking for a bunch of rocks.
00:05:02.177,00:05:08.391,"Here, just south by southwest of their position, there's a spot on the map called the Five Sisters."
00:05:08.475,00:05:11.853,Tell Toby to set a heading for 347 degrees.
00:05:15.524,00:05:18.401,"Here they are, just like Rumy said."
00:05:20.028,00:05:23.156,"We found the Five Sisters. Great job, guys."
00:05:26.368,00:05:31.122,"If these are called the Five Sisters, why do I count six rocks?"
00:05:31.206,00:05:34.793,"One, two, three, four-- I only count five."
00:05:38.713,00:05:41.174,"like a flat, gray island kind of rock."
00:05:41.258,00:05:44.594,Huh. Well the five that are left look just like shark fins.
00:05:44.678,00:05:46.763,And that's just like in the story.
00:05:46.847,00:05:48.640,So someone once saw BigFin here.
00:05:48.723,00:05:50.809,But where did she go after that?
00:05:59.901,00:06:05.282,"But the ocean's cold, and I don't see any islands at all."
00:06:05.365,00:06:07.784,What about Acorn Lagoon?
00:06:07.868,00:06:13.164,"Good idea. The water's definitely warm there, and it's connected to the ocean. Rumy..."
00:06:20.839,00:06:23.425,The island of the single palm is there!
00:06:23.508,00:06:27.679,Then we're headed for the warm waters of Acorn Lagoon.
00:06:27.762,00:06:29.556,-Yay! -Let's go!
00:06:40.442,00:06:43.695,"Hey, what are you?"
00:06:43.778,00:06:47.240,I'm a baby whale. My name's Poppy.
00:06:47.324,00:06:50.243,-Wow! -That's so cool!
00:06:50.327,00:06:51.828,Told you I heard giggling.
00:06:51.912,00:06:54.331,Are you BigFin? You're awfully small to be BigFin.
00:06:54.414,00:06:55.999,Who's BigFin?
00:06:56.082,00:06:58.960,Only the most legendary creature in all the ocean.
00:06:59.044,00:07:03.214,"She's gigantic and really nice, but nobody knows if she's real or not."
00:07:08.470,00:07:13.683,"Me? I'd love to help you find BigFin, but where do we look?"
00:07:13.808,00:07:16.770,The last clue said she lived on the island of the single palm.
00:07:16.853,00:07:19.230,We were thinking it might be in Acorn Lagoon.
00:07:19.356,00:07:21.858,It is. Do you want me to show you?
00:07:21.942,00:07:24.277,"Sure. Thanks, Poppy."
00:07:24.361,00:07:26.196,Come on. Follow me.
00:07:26.279,00:07:28.198,-Yay! -Yay!
00:07:40.418,00:07:43.213,"Here it is, the island of the single palm."
00:07:43.296,00:07:46.299,This is where my mom and I spend every winter.
00:07:46.383,00:07:49.678,"Really? If BigFin has been here, you must have seen her then."
00:07:49.761,00:07:51.429,Did you? Did you ever see BigFin?
00:07:51.513,00:07:57.018,"No, I don't think I've ever seen a BigFin, but maybe my mom has."
00:07:57.102,00:08:01.815,Her mom? A grown-up gray whale would be pretty big.
00:08:01.898,00:08:03.942,Maybe big enough to be BigFin.
00:08:04.025,00:08:07.696,"Poppy, can you call your mom? We'd love to meet her."
00:08:07.779,00:08:10.991,"Sure. Hey, Mom!"
00:08:15.245,00:08:17.956,-Whoa! -Wow!
00:08:24.004,00:08:26.673,I think we just found BigFin.
00:08:26.756,00:08:29.134,I think you're right.
00:08:30.593,00:08:33.638,"Mom, say hi to my new friends."
00:08:33.722,00:08:34.973,Hello.
00:08:37.642,00:08:41.062,You're the biggest anything I've ever seen.
00:08:41.187,00:08:43.273,I bet you're as big as BigFin!
00:08:46.860,00:08:49.946,So what are you guys doing in the lagoon?
00:08:50.030,00:08:54.159,"This is a nice, warm place for Poppy to play."
00:08:54.242,00:08:56.995,We'll go back north when winter is over.
00:08:58.204,00:09:06.379,It says here every year gray whales like Poppy's mom travel thousands of miles so they can raise their babies in warm lagoons like ours.
00:09:06.463,00:09:12.135,"I bet the first time someone saw whales in the lagoon, they didn't know what they were."
00:09:12.218,00:09:14.345,So they made up the BigFin stories.
00:09:14.429,00:09:17.348,That's right. BigFin is real.
00:09:20.101,00:09:23.688,Whoa. My mom is BigFin?
00:09:23.772,00:09:25.607,That's so cool!
00:09:27.776,00:09:30.612,"Mayday! Mayday! Uh, hello?"
00:09:30.695,00:09:31.905,"What is it, Rumy?"
00:09:33.073,00:09:35.909,Millie says the wind is starting to change directions.
00:09:35.992,00:09:38.495,You better hurry back to the beach.
00:09:42.499,00:09:47.337,"Uh-oh. If the wind is changing, we won't be able to sail back to the dock."
00:09:47.420,00:09:49.214,Don't worry. My Mom can help.
00:09:49.297,00:09:51.091,"-Right, Mom? -Definitely."
00:09:51.174,00:09:53.885,"Toss me a rope, and I'll get you home."
00:09:53.968,00:09:57.263,"Rumy and Millie, we'll meet you back at the beach."
00:09:57.347,00:09:59.766,"That's right, 'cause we're getting saved by..."
00:10:11.861,00:10:13.279,Whoa.
00:10:17.450,00:10:21.079,I can't believe BigFin just brought you home.
00:10:25.041,00:10:27.085,We did. It's so cool!
00:10:27.168,00:10:32.090,"You know, we could hear a BigFin story from BigFin herself."
00:10:32.173,00:10:34.509,"Wow. Will you, Mom?"
00:10:34.592,00:10:36.594,Of course. I'd love to.
00:10:36.678,00:10:41.599,"Gather round, and I'll tell you the story of BigFin and the silliest sailboat."
00:10:43.601,00:10:48.231,"But first, everyone smile, and say, Whales!"
00:10:48.314,00:10:49.941,-Whales! -Whales!
00:10:55.321,00:10:57.615,that whales spend the winter in our lagoon.
00:10:57.699,00:10:59.576,No wonder everyone made up stories.
00:10:59.659,00:11:01.911,They didn't know what they were seeing.
00:11:01.995,00:11:05.039,"But when you follow the facts, they lead you to the truth."
00:11:05.123,00:11:08.418,"And a couple of great, big new friends."
00:11:08.501,00:11:10.628,Time to close this case.
00:11:33.067,00:11:34.944,is officially closed.
00:11:44.871,00:11:47.999,And for enjoying delicious hot cocoa.
00:11:50.877,00:11:53.588,"Oh, wow. Did you see that one?"
00:11:53.671,00:11:56.466,That was the biggest shooting star I've ever seen.
00:11:56.549,00:12:02.388,"You know, when you see a shooting star, somebody gets to make a wish, and it might come true."
00:12:02.472,00:12:05.099,"Really? Oh, let Jay make one."
00:12:05.183,00:12:06.976,"Jay, what's your wish gonna be?"
00:12:07.060,00:12:08.895,Ooh. How exciting! Okay.
00:12:08.978,00:12:11.397,"Um, I wish for-- Uh, let's see."
00:12:11.481,00:12:13.399,"Um, I wish for..."
00:12:13.483,00:12:15.068,What's Bean doing?
00:12:15.151,00:12:17.278,What is Bean doing?
00:12:17.362,00:12:19.572,Bean? Hello!
00:12:19.656,00:12:21.115,"Oh, hey."
00:12:21.199,00:12:22.742,"Bean, what are you reading?"
00:12:22.825,00:12:26.329,I got the new Explorers of Acorn Springs book.
00:12:28.581,00:12:30.708,See? They're mountain climbing.
00:12:30.792,00:12:32.293,"Oh, I love those books."
00:12:32.377,00:12:34.796,My favorite is the one where they explore the jungle.
00:12:34.879,00:12:38.424,I like the knights in shining armor one.
00:12:38.508,00:12:41.177,And remember the one with the pirates?
00:12:41.261,00:12:45.765,"Avast. Matey, that was one swashbuckling tale, it was."
00:12:45.848,00:12:50.353,"It would be amazing to be pirates or knights on a safari, or brave mountain climbers on a quest."
00:12:50.436,00:12:52.522,I can't decide which one would be the most fun.
00:12:53.606,00:12:55.275,I'd like to do 'em all!
00:12:55.358,00:12:59.153,I wish I could be a pirate knight who took a safari to a mountaintop!
00:12:59.237,00:13:01.656,Hey. We were just wishing on shooting stars.
00:13:01.739,00:13:04.367,"You could find one, and then wish for all that stuff."
00:13:04.450,00:13:07.287,There's one. Quick. Make a wish.
00:13:09.747,00:13:13.626,I wish-- I wish for all the adventures in my books!
00:13:15.795,00:13:18.423,So where are my adventures?
00:13:18.506,00:13:21.259,A wish that big might take a little time.
00:13:21.342,00:13:23.886,Four adventures in one is a lot to ask for. I don't know.
00:13:23.970,00:13:25.931,You might need to wait 'til morning.
00:13:26.006,00:13:28.266,"Yeah, after we have a good night's sleep."
00:13:28.349,00:13:30.435,Then I'm going to bed right now.
00:13:30.518,00:13:35.898,"The sooner I go to sleep, the sooner I wake up, and the sooner I wake up, the sooner my wish comes true."
00:13:35.982,00:13:37.817,"Good night, everybody!"
00:13:46.701,00:13:48.828,"Bean, what's wrong?"
00:13:51.122,00:13:58.421,"I made my wish, and I waited all night, but look. I still don't have my jungle-pirate-knights in shining armor mountain climbers."
00:13:58.504,00:14:05.345,"Wait! I just thought of something. If Bean wished on a star, then his wish is probably still sitting on that star somewhere out there."
00:14:05.428,00:14:07.180,That makes sense.
00:14:07.263,00:14:10.600,"If we find the star, we'll find Bean's wish."
00:14:13.895,00:14:16.314,Can you guys help me find my shooting star?
00:14:16.397,00:14:17.815,Sure we can.
00:14:17.899,00:14:20.026,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:14:20.109,00:14:21.319,Will you excuse us?
00:14:21.402,00:14:23.738,To the treehouse!
00:14:29.702,00:14:33.998,"If we find the star Bean wished on, maybe his wish will come true."
00:14:34.082,00:14:38.127,"We'll never know for sure, unless we find that star."
00:14:38.211,00:14:42.882,And Bean really wants to be a jungle-pirate-knight in shining armor mountain climber.
00:14:42.965,00:14:44.467,There's a lot at stake.
00:14:44.550,00:14:47.595,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:14:47.678,00:14:49.514,Let's do this.
00:15:22.839,00:15:31.639,"We know the star flew over the trees, so if we use the clues, it probably landed right here on the beach somewhere."
00:15:31.722,00:15:35.143,Oh! So this is like a treasure hunt!
00:15:35.226,00:15:41.441,"Exactly, and just like treasure, a star is going to be shiny, so look for something that sparkles."
00:15:44.402,00:15:48.739,"Aye, mateys, pirates in search of our starry pirate's treasure."
00:15:48.823,00:15:51.993,Shiver me timbers. I see an X.
00:16:08.759,00:16:12.180,"Oh, no! The hermit crab has got my star!"
00:16:12.263,00:16:14.974,What's he going to do with all those adventures?
00:16:15.057,00:16:17.101,Maybe he'll share. Come on.
00:16:18.686,00:16:20.521,Huh?
00:16:26.068,00:16:27.278,We be friendly pirates.
00:16:27.361,00:16:30.656,We just want to share the magic of that shooting star.
00:16:35.244,00:16:38.039,He's right. It's just sea glass.
00:16:38.122,00:16:39.916,It's not a star at all.
00:16:39.999,00:16:45.630,"We followed the facts we had, but it looks like your star got away. I'm sorry, Bean."
00:16:48.716,00:16:53.763,We just have to wait until tonight so Bean can wish on a brand-new star.
00:16:53.846,00:16:58.142,"And this time, we'll be ready to catch it."
00:17:02.897,00:17:09.487,"This star stakeout is officially on, you know, as soon as it gets dark."
00:17:09.570,00:17:12.281,"And while we wait, we can have a snack."
00:17:12.365,00:17:14.784,I baked some cookies that look like stars.
00:17:14.867,00:17:16.285,Go on. Take one.
00:17:17.828,00:17:25.378,Look. My star cookie is up floating in the sky right by that fire-breathing dragon.
00:17:25.461,00:17:28.548,Wow! That cloud does look like a dragon.
00:17:28.631,00:17:30.424,Don't let it eat your cookie.
00:17:33.594,00:17:36.222,not with the princess protecting it.
00:17:36.305,00:17:39.976,She's not afraid of fire-breathing dragons.
00:17:40.059,00:17:42.144,Wait. Look at that.
00:17:44.146,00:17:46.857,have decided to join forces to save the knight.
00:17:46.941,00:17:50.027,"See? He's stuck up in a great, big tower."
00:17:57.368,00:18:01.372,"Oh, I'm wishing for all my adventures."
00:18:01.455,00:18:03.207,"Okay, then, Star Catchers."
00:18:03.291,00:18:05.418,It's star-catching time.
00:18:05.501,00:18:07.003,It went that way!
00:18:08.337,00:18:10.089,Let's do this!
00:18:10.172,00:18:12.800,...and the pirate and the mountain climbers...
00:18:13.926,00:18:16.554,"Guys, wait for me!"
00:18:21.642,00:18:24.270,So what do we do now?
00:18:29.317,00:18:34.488,"If we're gonna find Bean's star, we're gonna have to get through this very jungley jungle."
00:18:36.407,00:18:37.700,What was that?
00:18:37.783,00:18:41.662,It sounded like a crested black macaque or a macaw...
00:18:41.746,00:18:44.790,or a macaroon. Almost impossible to say.
00:18:44.874,00:18:49.503,We better move. Let's cross the jungle safari-style.
00:18:49.587,00:18:52.381,Everybody do the safari sneak.
00:18:54.091,00:18:57.261,And now everybody do the jungle jump.
00:19:09.065,00:19:12.360,Wait. Where'd my star go?
00:19:12.443,00:19:18.616,"It went this way. I'm sure of it, but shooting stars just fall so fast, it's hard to catch 'em!"
00:19:18.699,00:19:24.497,"You're right, and once they go behind the trees, there's just no way of knowing where they landed."
00:19:24.580,00:19:29.710,"Wait a minute. All those things you mentioned are clues, clues we can use."
00:19:29.794,00:19:33.756,"If the trees are blocking our view, we've gotta find a place above them."
00:19:33.839,00:19:37.802,-How are we gonna get up high? -We climb.
00:19:42.807,00:19:47.061,We made it! We hiked to the top just like the Merry Mountaineers.
00:19:52.400,00:19:54.318,in Acorn Springs from here.
00:19:57.154,00:20:01.283,"Now, when you see a shooting star, you can make your wish."
00:20:03.661,00:20:06.330,I can't wait. I've never caught a star before.
00:20:09.875,00:20:11.585,Somebody catch one!
00:20:14.839,00:20:16.132,It's getting away!
00:20:21.137,00:20:23.013,"I'm gonna get you, you shooting star."
00:20:23.931,00:20:25.683,-Oops! -Ahh!
00:20:29.979,00:20:33.566,Huh. I don't think that worked out exactly like we hoped.
00:20:33.649,00:20:39.947,"You're right. Now that we're up here, you can see the shooting stars are actually really far away."
00:20:40.030,00:20:42.408,And none of them are actually hitting the ground.
00:20:42.491,00:20:45.327,It looks like they're just disappearing in the sky.
00:20:45.411,00:20:47.288,"Yeah, where are they going?"
00:20:48.414,00:20:52.126,It says here that shooting stars are bits of space dust.
00:20:52.453,00:20:57.173,"They light up when they get close to us, then, fwoosh, they just vanish."
00:20:57.339,00:20:58.632,"I'm sorry, Bean."
00:20:58.716,00:21:01.719,I know you really wanted your wish to come true.
00:21:01.802,00:21:03.095,I really did.
00:21:03.179,00:21:09.769,"But you know what? Even though we didn't catch a star, I think Bean did get his wish."
00:21:09.852,00:21:11.103,I did?
00:21:11.187,00:21:14.106,Yeah. We dug for treasure like real pirates.
00:21:14.190,00:21:17.443,And we saw knights and princesses in the clouds.
00:21:17.526,00:21:20.821,And played a game of follow the leader in the jungle.
00:21:20.905,00:21:25.868,And don't forget we climbed to the top of the highest mountain in Acorn Springs.
00:21:25.951,00:21:30.790,"It was everything I wished for, and we did it all."
00:21:30.873,00:21:34.084,I guess you don't need stars to make your wishes come true.
00:21:34.251,00:21:36.712,You just need your friends.
00:21:36.796,00:21:40.841,You guys are better than all the shooting stars in the world.
00:21:41.926,00:21:45.805,"Everybody smile, and say, Shooting stars!"
00:21:45.888,00:21:47.848,-Shooting stars! -Shooting stars!
00:21:51.894,00:21:55.314,"Last night, we learned so much about shooting stars."
00:21:55.397,00:21:58.901,I can't believe they never get close enough to catch.
00:21:58.984,00:22:04.949,"It's true. They don't, and they're not really stars at all, but it's fun to make wishes when you see them."
00:22:05.157,00:22:08.994,Especially when your friends can help make those wishes come true.
00:22:09.078,00:22:11.247,Time to close this case.
00:00:33.622,00:00:54.583,LITTLE DETECTIVES TOBY &amp; TERI Yay! Great jump!
00:00:54.667,00:00:56.458,That's how you play puddle jump.
00:00:56.542,00:00:58.042,"Okay, Toby, your turn."
00:01:04.417,00:01:06.292,The Big Kahuna.
00:01:06.375,00:01:08.292,Here goes nothing.
00:01:10.250,00:01:11.958,-Wow! -Great jump!
00:01:19.114,00:01:22.500,"Okay, my turn now. Watch."
00:01:40.917,00:01:43.458,I'll never get over it.
00:01:43.542,00:01:46.625,Sure you will. You just need to keep trying.
00:01:48.125,00:01:50.667,"Hey, everybody, you gotta come see."
00:01:50.750,00:01:54.458,I got a new jar of water for my collection.
00:01:54.542,00:01:57.295,-Wow! -All right!
00:01:59.042,00:02:01.333,"Wow! That's really cool, Rumy."
00:02:01.417,00:02:04.292,That's the nicest jar of water I've ever seen.
00:02:06.208,00:02:08.875,It's going to be perfect for my collection.
00:02:08.958,00:02:12.250,That's right. You collect water from all over the world.
00:02:12.333,00:02:19.083,"I do. I sent water from Acorn Springs to friends, and they send me water from where they live."
00:02:19.167,00:02:24.333,"Rumy has water from the world's biggest lake and now from the longest river, too."
00:02:24.417,00:02:31.125,"And water from a hot springs, but I don't open that one. It smells like rotten eggs."
00:02:31.208,00:02:32.750,Ooh! I wanna smell it!
00:02:36.542,00:02:38.958,"Hey, you guys wanna see my whole collection?"
00:02:39.042,00:02:40.000,-Okay. -Sure.
00:02:40.083,00:02:43.708,-Totally. -Come on. Follow me.
00:02:46.458,00:02:48.417,Welcome to my water collection.
00:02:48.500,00:02:53.750,"With the help of friends from all over, I've collected water from every corner of the world."
00:02:57.667,00:02:58.667,What water?
00:02:58.750,00:02:59.958,Bean's right.
00:03:00.042,00:03:01.833,There's no water in that jar.
00:03:01.917,00:03:04.333,Wait. There's no water in any of them!
00:03:04.417,00:03:05.458,They're all empty!
00:03:10.021,00:03:13.125,W-Where did it go? What am I going to do?
00:03:13.208,00:03:16.667,All the jars were filled with water when you showed them to me last week.
00:03:16.750,00:03:18.458,Maybe someone spilled them.
00:03:18.542,00:03:21.083,Let me check for fingerprints.
00:03:24.083,00:03:33.333,"I don't think anyone would have touched them, because I wrote, Rumy's water. Do not touch, and, Please, on every jar."
00:03:33.417,00:03:38.458,"Just one print on this one, but it's Rumy's."
00:03:38.542,00:03:41.917,"Hmm, so nobody touched the jars?"
00:03:42.052,00:03:43.753,Then where did the water go?
00:03:43.875,00:03:46.500,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:03:46.583,00:03:48.250,Will you excuse us?
00:03:48.333,00:03:49.708,To the treehouse!
00:03:56.083,00:03:58.833,Rumy really loves his water collection.
00:03:59.011,00:04:01.000,It took him months to put it together.
00:04:01.083,00:04:04.083,-We've gotta get it back. -There's a lot at stake.
00:04:04.167,00:04:07.000,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:04:07.083,00:04:08.875,Let's do this.
00:04:41.667,00:04:45.542,"So, Millie, you're saying you were the last one to see the water?"
00:04:45.625,00:04:47.292,Yes. That's right.
00:04:47.872,00:04:49.375,"And when was that, exactly?"
00:04:49.458,00:04:51.167,It was three days ago.
00:04:51.288,00:04:55.542,"When Rumy showed you the collection, you said there was still water in the jars, yes?"
00:04:55.625,00:05:00.750,"There was. I remember, because I opened up the jars so Millie could touch the water."
00:05:00.833,00:05:03.000,Right. So you touched the water?
00:05:03.083,00:05:04.792,How did that feel?
00:05:04.875,00:05:06.875,"Uh, wet?"
00:05:06.958,00:05:09.500,Of course. Heh. Sorry.
00:05:09.583,00:05:12.042,I knew that. All water is wet.
00:05:12.125,00:05:14.583,Wait. That could be a clue.
00:05:14.667,00:05:21.000,"If all the water in Acorn Springs is like Rumy's water, then I wonder if it's disappearing, too."
00:05:21.083,00:05:23.292,Where else have we seen water today?
00:05:23.667,00:05:24.875,-The puddles! -The puddles!
00:05:24.958,00:05:26.000,Come on.
00:05:37.917,00:05:39.417,I did it!
00:05:39.500,00:05:42.042,Wow! You really flew that time.
00:05:42.125,00:05:43.333,It wasn't even close.
00:05:43.417,00:05:46.250,"Guys, Bean jumped over the Big Kahuna!"
00:05:46.333,00:05:49.083,"That's really great, Bean. Amazing!"
00:05:49.167,00:05:50.292,Thanks.
00:05:50.375,00:05:56.458,"But now that I look at the Big Kahuna, it doesn't look so big anymore."
00:05:56.542,00:06:00.583,"You're right. This morning, it was almost to that tree."
00:06:05.042,00:06:10.875,"Wait. First someone takes all the water from my collection, and now they steal the Big Kahuna?"
00:06:10.958,00:06:12.542,Who would do that?
00:06:12.625,00:06:17.292,"We don't know what happened yet Rumy, and remember, there were no fingerprints on the jars."
00:06:17.375,00:06:19.167,Then where is the water going?
00:06:19.250,00:06:20.375,And where does it end?
00:06:20.458,00:06:26.171,"If someone is taking all the water in Acorn Springs, that would be really bad, especially if you're a fish."
00:06:27.125,00:06:28.125,-Boots! -Boots!
00:06:34.542,00:06:36.917,And all his water is right where it should be.
00:06:37.042,00:06:38.833,So let's follow the facts.
00:06:38.917,00:06:41.208,The water in Boots's tank is fine.
00:06:41.292,00:06:43.875,But the water in the puddles is disappearing.
00:06:43.958,00:06:46.958,So how is the fish tank different from the puddles?
00:06:47.042,00:06:48.708,The fish tank has a lid on it.
00:06:48.792,00:06:52.375,"Sure, but Rumy's jars all have lids, too."
00:06:52.458,00:06:57.042,"They do, but Rumy took off the lids so Millie -could touch the water. -Right."
00:06:57.125,00:07:00.708,But didn't Rumy say he left the lid on one of his jars?
00:07:00.792,00:07:03.333,"Yes, the stinky one."
00:07:03.417,00:07:07.583,"So one jar is still closed, just like the fish tank."
00:07:07.667,00:07:12.042,"If we follow the facts, the stinky water should still be there."
00:07:12.125,00:07:13.500,Let's find out.
00:07:19.403,00:07:21.353,Did you guys find Rumy's water yet?
00:07:21.528,00:07:24.833,Not yet. We're still looking for more clues.
00:07:24.926,00:07:28.542,"Rumy, do you have the jar of water from the hot springs?"
00:07:28.625,00:07:29.625,Sure.
00:07:31.833,00:07:33.625,It's still got water in it!
00:07:34.875,00:07:37.208,No one's stealing the stinky water.
00:07:38.292,00:07:41.417,I think there's another reason this water's still here.
00:07:41.500,00:07:43.708,Rumy never took the lid off this one.
00:07:43.792,00:07:46.583,Only the water that's open to the air is disappearing.
00:07:47.032,00:07:50.000,"-Like the puddles! -That's right, Bean."
00:07:50.083,00:07:52.167,"Okay, let's follow the facts."
00:07:52.250,00:07:58.125,"Rumy took the lids off his water collection last week, and now all the water is gone."
00:07:58.208,00:08:02.542,"And the puddles were there this morning, but got smaller by the afternoon."
00:08:02.625,00:08:05.958,"As the day got warmer, the puddles got smaller."
00:08:06.042,00:08:09.375,The water that's open to the air is going somewhere...
00:08:11.250,00:08:13.125,and I think I know where.
00:08:13.240,00:08:14.167,-Where? -Where?
00:08:14.315,00:08:21.375,"I can explain, but I think it'll be easier -from the top of that mountain. -Then let's get climbing."
00:08:23.583,00:08:27.583,"Nobody took your water, Rumy, and nobody took our puddles."
00:08:27.667,00:08:29.208,Look at Acorn Springs.
00:08:29.664,00:08:33.167,We can see the pond and the spring and the ocean.
00:08:33.250,00:08:37.042,But where's my water and the water from the puddles?
00:08:37.125,00:08:38.917,It's in the air around us.
00:08:39.000,00:08:43.750,"When the sun is out and air is dry, drops of water are pulled into the air."
00:08:43.833,00:08:45.083,It's called evaporation.
00:08:45.208,00:08:53.792,"So when I left the lids off my jars, the water floated away a little at a time until it was all gone?"
00:08:53.875,00:08:55.042,It's not gone.
00:08:55.125,00:09:00.367,"When there's enough water in the air, it turns into clouds. Clouds are full of water."
00:09:01.583,00:09:03.792,Look at that big one coming our way.
00:09:07.083,00:09:12.417,"Yep, your water went up into the air as evaporation, and now it's gonna come back down as rain."
00:09:12.791,00:09:13.667,Wow.
00:09:13.800,00:09:15.833,I think it's gonna start raining soon.
00:09:16.289,00:09:19.125,You're right. We better go before we get wet.
00:09:19.765,00:09:20.938,-Quick! -Hurry!
00:09:21.029,00:09:22.179,-Let's go! -Come on!
00:09:38.542,00:09:42.417,The rain filled up my jars. Look at them all.
00:09:47.667,00:09:50.375,"I'm so happy all your water is back, Rumy."
00:09:50.458,00:09:51.750,"Me, too!"
00:09:52.222,00:09:56.458,"And that water is from every lake, ocean, and river in the world."
00:09:56.542,00:09:59.292,Your collection is even better than it was before.
00:09:59.375,00:10:02.167,I know! It's amazing!
00:10:02.324,00:10:04.500,"Oh, you know what?"
00:10:04.664,00:10:08.042,"Maybe our puddles are back, too. Come on."
00:10:08.125,00:10:11.833,I'm gonna jump the Big Kahuna for real this time.
00:10:21.292,00:10:23.958,"Okay, Bean. Show us how it's done."
00:10:25.917,00:10:27.625,"You can do it, Bean!"
00:10:34.625,00:10:35.625,Hah!
00:10:41.833,00:10:43.250,I did it!
00:10:44.708,00:10:46.583,"Whoo! Good job, Bean!"
00:10:49.042,00:10:50.750,-All right! -Whoo! Yay!
00:10:50.833,00:10:53.375,"Everybody say, Puddles!"
00:10:53.458,00:10:54.583,-Puddles! -Puddles!
00:10:58.708,00:11:01.125,So Rumy's water didn't really disappear.
00:11:01.208,00:11:07.250,"Nope. No water does. Just like our puddles, Rumy's water went into the air and came back as rain."
00:11:07.333,00:11:09.314,Time to close this case.
00:11:32.125,00:11:33.844,is officially closed.
00:11:51.295,00:11:52.167,Ta-da!
00:11:57.247,00:11:58.473,Huh?
00:11:59.375,00:12:01.917,Is everybody ready for tomorrow's talent show?
00:12:02.000,00:12:03.375,You're darn tooting.
00:12:03.458,00:12:13.292,"Rumy's got himself a regular hoedown planned, Jay's fixing to show us some magic, Bean's juggling, and we all gonna do some old-fashioned cowboy rope tricks."
00:12:15.625,00:12:16.792,But what about you?
00:12:19.375,00:12:24.875,"Mm, I'd love to sing a song, but I can't sing in front of everyone."
00:12:24.958,00:12:29.708,Sure you can. All you gotta do is get up onstage and sing.
00:12:29.792,00:12:37.323,"I'm scared to. I'm just not a very good singer, but I wish-- Oh, never mind. I gotta go."
00:12:40.792,00:12:44.917,"Yeah. Seems like she just wants to be alone, just for now."
00:12:50.667,00:12:53.911,I wish I could just take the stage and sing a song.
00:13:01.292,00:13:02.917,What was I thinking?
00:13:11.833,00:13:14.208,Who's out there? Hello?
00:13:14.292,00:13:16.375,You sang the same tune I did.
00:13:29.083,00:13:32.542,Your voice is beautiful. Try some harmony.
00:13:42.917,00:13:48.083,"I'm afraid to sing onstage, but if you were there, I think I could do it."
00:13:49.500,00:13:51.458,Wait. Where'd you go?
00:13:55.375,00:13:57.167,I've just gotta find that singer.
00:13:57.833,00:14:01.446,She has the most beautiful voice I've ever heard.
00:14:01.873,00:14:05.583,"If she sang with me, I know I'd have the courage to sing in our show."
00:14:05.792,00:14:09.292,But she disappeared when you asked her if she wanted to sing onstage?
00:14:09.375,00:14:18.042,"Yes. It's always been my dream to sing onstage and sing with a partner, like my absolute favorite singers, Patty and Polly Wannakracher."
00:14:18.125,00:14:21.000,"They only sing together, and it sounds amazing!"
00:14:21.083,00:14:22.917,You've just gotta find that singer.
00:14:23.000,00:14:25.375,Sounds like we've got a case.
00:14:25.458,00:14:26.917,Will you excuse us?
00:14:27.000,00:14:28.833,To the treehouse!
00:14:36.125,00:14:38.833,Millie really wants to sing in the talent show.
00:14:38.917,00:14:41.417,But only if the mystery singer will sing with her.
00:14:41.500,00:14:43.208,Which means we've gotta find her.
00:14:43.383,00:14:44.792,There's a lot at stake.
00:14:44.979,00:14:47.833,"There always is, little brother. There always is."
00:14:48.208,00:14:49.737,Let's do this.
00:15:18.083,00:15:21.375,"Okay, Millie, we're definitely gonna find your singing partner."
00:15:21.501,00:15:26.447,"All we've gotta do is follow the facts, beginning with where you were when you heard your mystery singer."
00:15:26.917,00:15:30.583,"I was here, and the mystery singer was..."
00:15:30.667,00:15:32.792,over there in the trees.
00:15:38.274,00:15:40.002,Do you sing? Are you a singer?
00:15:41.125,00:15:44.167,"Oh, I have a beautiful voice."
00:15:44.250,00:15:45.417,Listen.
00:15:49.333,00:15:51.833,Wow. Thanks for that.
00:15:51.917,00:15:55.042,"Millie, is that the beautiful singing you heard?"
00:15:55.125,00:15:59.083,"It's not, but that was beautiful."
00:15:59.167,00:16:02.667,"It was just beautiful in a different way, but thanks."
00:16:02.750,00:16:05.750,Anytime. It's a gift.
00:16:07.417,00:16:10.333,But he definitely wasn't Millie's mystery singer.
00:16:10.417,00:16:12.958,Whoever is must have left some evidence behind.
00:16:16.425,00:16:19.417,"You'd think there'd be footprints, but there aren't any."
00:16:19.500,00:16:25.583,"So Millie's mystery singer has a beautiful voice, can move through the forest without leaving footprints."
00:16:25.667,00:16:28.363,How can someone not leave footprints?
00:16:28.455,00:16:30.500,Yeah. Don't everyone's feet touch the ground?
00:16:30.583,00:16:33.715,"I mean, if your feet didn't touch the ground, you'd have to be..."
00:16:33.840,00:16:34.792,um...
00:16:36.125,00:16:39.416,"Oh, you'd be a bird, like me."
00:16:39.516,00:16:40.458,Never mind.
00:16:40.828,00:16:42.042,"But you're right, Jay."
00:16:42.337,00:16:45.792,"If we use the clues, Millie's singing partner is a bird."
00:16:46.245,00:16:48.292,There are so many birds in the forest.
00:16:48.375,00:16:50.875,How will we know which one is Millie's singer?
00:16:51.410,00:16:53.917,Let's start the auditions.
00:17:22.542,00:17:24.750,"Hey, do you wanna sing for Millie?"
00:17:26.357,00:17:28.417,Wait! Don't run away!
00:17:29.005,00:17:30.167,It's a mockingbird.
00:17:30.250,00:17:33.250,I wonder if there's a reason she didn't audition.
00:17:33.620,00:17:35.417,Let's see what she has to say.
00:17:38.208,00:17:40.167,Excuse me. Hello?
00:17:40.780,00:17:42.667,We just want to ask you some questions.
00:17:44.708,00:17:46.542,Thanks. This won't take a second.
00:17:46.625,00:17:49.375,We were wondering-- Why didn't you want to audition?
00:17:49.458,00:17:51.375,We saw you watching from behind the tree.
00:17:51.458,00:17:54.112,"Well, to tell you the truth-- Do you sing?"
00:17:54.195,00:17:56.732,Millie's looking for whoever sang with her this morning.
00:18:01.625,00:18:04.833,"Yeah, up onstage singing in front of everyone!"
00:18:04.917,00:18:07.542,"Sing with her onstage? Oh, no."
00:18:07.625,00:18:10.917,I'm not good enough to sing onstage. Goodbye.
00:18:12.417,00:18:14.917,We're never gonna find my singing partner.
00:18:15.254,00:18:17.583,I think maybe we just did.
00:18:17.667,00:18:24.625,"Mockingbirds are famous for copying any sound or song they hear, which is what your mystery singer did, right?"
00:18:25.190,00:18:31.917,"Yes, but if the mockingbird really is the beautiful singer I heard, why would she be afraid to sing onstage?"
00:18:32.231,00:18:35.906,"Maybe she doesn't know how good a singer she is, just like you."
00:18:36.361,00:18:39.000,But I think I know how to convince her to sing in the show.
00:18:39.366,00:18:40.666,But we scared her away.
00:18:40.777,00:18:42.813,How will find her and get her to come back?
00:18:43.113,00:18:46.875,I think she'll come back if Millie sings.
00:18:47.413,00:18:49.583,With everyone listening?
00:18:49.667,00:18:52.333,I don't know. That's really embarrassing.
00:18:52.417,00:18:54.167,"You can do it, Millie."
00:18:54.250,00:18:57.708,Yeah. We'll be right over here behind these bushes.
00:18:57.792,00:18:59.917,You won't even know we're here.
00:19:00.958,00:19:03.417,Would it be okay if I record you both singing?
00:19:03.500,00:19:05.583,I guess so. But why would you want to?
00:19:05.988,00:19:08.375,"I don't know. Just for fun, I guess."
00:19:08.831,00:19:11.973,Now all you have to do is coax the mockingbird out of hiding.
00:19:12.073,00:19:13.458,You can do it.
00:19:16.292,00:19:18.500,Okay. Here goes.
00:19:18.925,00:19:22.833,"Here I am all by myself, just like this morning."
00:19:22.917,00:19:25.042,Nobody here but me.
00:19:35.583,00:19:37.750,Wow! They're really good.
00:19:37.833,00:19:41.708,It's the most beautiful sound I've ever heard.
00:19:41.792,00:19:43.750,I can't believe that's Millie.
00:19:43.833,00:19:50.333,"And with this recording, we can show Millie and the mockingbird -just how good they really are. -Great idea."
00:19:50.417,00:19:52.500,Come on. Let's go talk to them.
00:19:53.833,00:19:57.833,"So Millie, I know you and the mockingbird don't wanna sing in the show."
00:19:57.917,00:20:00.167,I'm not a very good singer.
00:20:00.250,00:20:03.833,-Neither am I. -It's okay. You don't have to.
00:20:03.917,00:20:05.500,I've found someone else to sing.
00:20:05.583,00:20:06.667,You want to hear them?
00:20:06.750,00:20:08.592,You can tell us if they're any good.
00:20:08.692,00:20:09.942,-Sure. -Of course.
00:20:12.750,00:20:15.208,Whoever that is can really sing.
00:20:15.292,00:20:19.708,"Yeah, it's really beauti-- Wait. Is that..."
00:20:19.792,00:20:20.750,-us? -Us?
00:20:20.833,00:20:24.167,Yup. That's what you two sound like to all your friends.
00:20:26.125,00:20:28.958,I think your voice is beautiful.
00:20:29.042,00:20:30.583,"I think yours is, too."
00:20:30.667,00:20:32.831,You guys sound great.
00:20:32.931,00:20:35.625,"Oh, you just have to sing in the talent show."
00:20:36.737,00:20:38.167,I will if you will.
00:20:38.250,00:20:40.129,Okay. Let's sing.
00:20:46.333,00:20:50.625,and welcome to the first annual Acorn Springs Talent Show!
00:20:50.708,00:20:54.125,We have some really amazing acts for you today.
00:21:17.667,00:21:20.482,We hope you enjoy our duet.
00:21:47.125,00:21:52.625,"Okay, say-- Wait. Don't say, Sing. Just sing."
00:21:57.542,00:22:01.333,"It takes courage to sing in front of anyone, even your friends."
00:22:01.542,00:22:04.708,New things are always easier when you don't have to try them alone.
00:22:04.862,00:22:08.458,And now Millie and the mockingbird both know how great they sound.
00:22:08.542,00:22:10.458,Time to close this case.
00:22:33.583,00:22:34.958,is officially closed.
