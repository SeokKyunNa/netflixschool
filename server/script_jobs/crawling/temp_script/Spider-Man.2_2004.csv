00:03:03.308,00:03:05.352,Mary Jane Watson.
00:03:05.352,00:03:06.770,"Oh, boy."
00:03:06.770,00:03:09.356,If she only knew how I felt about her.
00:03:09.356,00:03:11.566,But she can never know.
00:03:11.566,00:03:17.572,"I made a choice once to live a life of responsibility, a life she can never be a part of."
00:03:17.572,00:03:19.074,Who am I?
00:03:19.074,00:03:22.077,"I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do."
00:03:22.077,00:03:25.122,"And I'm Peter Parker, and I, too, have a job."
00:03:25.122,00:03:26.999,MAN: Parker! Parker!
00:03:26.999,00:03:28.876,"No. No, no, no, no stop! Stop!"
00:03:30.752,00:03:32.046,"Parker, you're late, man."
00:03:32.046,00:03:33.755,"Always late, huh?"
00:03:33.755,00:03:36.842,"I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz, there was a..."
00:03:36.842,00:03:37.926,"Disturbance, another disturbance."
00:03:37.926,00:03:39.094,Always a disturbance with you.
00:03:39.094,00:03:41.180,Come on.
00:03:39.094,00:03:43.098,"Twenty-one minutes ago, in comes order, Harmattan, Burton &amp; Smith."
00:03:43.098,00:03:44.975,Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.
00:03:44.975,00:03:48.979,"In eight minutes, I am defaulting on Joe's 29-minute guarantee."
00:03:48.979,00:03:54.651,"Then not only am I receiving no money for these pizzas, but I will lose the customer forever to Pizza Yurt."
00:03:54.651,00:03:56.737,"Look, you are my only hope, all right?"
00:03:56.737,00:03:58.321,You have to make it in time.
00:03:58.321,00:04:02.367,"Peter, you're a nice guy, but you're just not dependable."
00:04:02.367,00:04:03.660,This is your last chance.
00:04:04.578,00:04:09.499,"You have to go 42 blocks in seven and one-half minutes, or your ass is fired."
00:04:10.751,00:04:11.835,Go!
00:04:35.067,00:04:36.651,"MAN: Hey, what're you, stupid?"
00:04:56.004,00:04:58.673,Whoo-hoo!
00:04:58.673,00:05:00.175,Whoa!
00:05:00.175,00:05:01.969,He stole that guy's pizzas!
00:05:09.143,00:05:10.644,GIRL: My ball!
00:05:10.644,00:05:12.729,I'm gonna get it!
00:05:14.898,00:05:16.191,Yah!
00:05:26.576,00:05:27.869,Hm.
00:05:27.869,00:05:30.164,"Hey, you guys, no playing in the streets."
00:05:30.164,00:05:31.665,"BOTH: Yes, Mr. Spider-Man."
00:05:31.665,00:05:33.000,See you.
00:05:34.626,00:05:36.003,"WOMAN: Way to go, Spidey!"
00:06:28.930,00:06:30.182,Pizza time.
00:06:35.603,00:06:38.273,You're late.
00:06:38.273,00:06:39.607,I'm not paying for those.
00:06:58.085,00:07:01.922,"AZIZ: Joe's 29-minute guarantee is a promise, man."
00:07:01.922,00:07:06.509,"I know to you, Parker, a promise means nothing, but to me, it's serious."
00:07:06.509,00:07:08.387,"It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz."
00:07:08.387,00:07:10.138,You're fired. Go.
00:07:10.138,00:07:11.932,"Please, I need this job."
00:07:11.932,00:07:13.600,"Look, give me another chance."
00:07:22.734,00:07:24.527,JAMESON: You're fired.
00:07:24.527,00:07:25.737,"Parker, hello. You're fired."
00:07:25.737,00:07:26.738,Why?
00:07:26.738,00:07:28.323,Dogs catching Frisbees?
00:07:28.323,00:07:29.532,Pigeons in the park?
00:07:29.532,00:07:30.491,A couple of geezers playing chess?
00:07:30.491,00:07:31.868,Boss-- Not now!
00:07:31.868,00:07:34.996,I was thinking maybe the Bugle could show another side of New York for a change.
00:07:34.996,00:07:36.915,"We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah."
00:07:36.915,00:07:38.333,We need page one.
00:07:36.915,00:07:39.918,"Parker, I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste."
00:07:39.918,00:07:44.714,I pay you because-- Still not now! I pay you because for some reason that psycho Spider-Man will pose for you.
00:07:44.714,00:07:46.800,Spider-Man won't let me take any more pictures.
00:07:46.800,00:07:48.093,You've turned the whole city against him.
00:07:48.093,00:07:49.510,A fact I'm very proud of.
00:07:49.510,00:07:52.889,"Now, get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before I go into a diabetic coma."
00:07:52.889,00:07:55.058,"Boss, your wife's on the line."
00:07:55.058,00:07:56.268,She says she lost her checkbook.
00:07:56.268,00:07:57.477,Thanks for the good news.
00:07:57.477,00:07:59.938,"Mr. Jameson, please, isn't there any of these shots you can use?"
00:07:59.938,00:08:00.897,I really need the money.
00:08:00.897,00:08:02.899,Aw...
00:08:02.899,00:08:04.151,Yes?
00:08:04.151,00:08:06.027,"Five minutes to deadline, Jonah."
00:08:06.027,00:08:10.907,"All right, run a picture of a rancid chicken, here's the headline: Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."
00:08:10.907,00:08:12.033,Some food got poisoned?
00:08:12.033,00:08:13.285,"I'm a little nauseous, yeah."
00:08:13.285,00:08:14.619,"All right, Mr. Jameson."
00:08:16.955,00:08:18.332,It stinks.
00:08:18.332,00:08:19.540,"Robbie, there's your page one."
00:08:19.540,00:08:21.168,Masked Menace Terrorizes Town.
00:08:21.168,00:08:22.794,"I told you, he's not a menace."
00:08:22.794,00:08:24.629,And I told you-- I'll take care of it.
00:08:24.629,00:08:26.506,I'll give you 150.
00:08:26.506,00:08:28.633,That's outrageous!
00:08:28.633,00:08:30.218,Give this to the girl.
00:08:30.218,00:08:31.594,"Thank you, bye-bye."
00:08:31.594,00:08:32.929,Hi.
00:08:33.513,00:08:34.806,"Hey, Pete."
00:08:36.183,00:08:37.476,Oh.
00:08:37.476,00:08:41.146,I don't think this covers the advance I gave you a couple weeks ago.
00:08:41.146,00:08:42.897,Oh...right.
00:08:42.897,00:08:44.232,Sorry.
00:08:45.400,00:08:46.860,Hey.
00:08:46.860,00:08:48.653,"Chin up, okay?"
00:09:01.333,00:09:02.917,Oh!
00:09:12.177,00:09:14.054,"Oh, hey. Wow."
00:09:14.054,00:09:16.097,Dr. Connors. Sorry.
00:09:16.097,00:09:17.765,"Where were you headed, Parker?"
00:09:17.765,00:09:19.142,To your class.
00:09:19.142,00:09:21.144,My class is over.
00:09:21.144,00:09:23.313,See me standing here?
00:09:23.313,00:09:25.148,I-I'm sorry.
00:09:25.148,00:09:26.274,I'm trying. I...
00:09:26.274,00:09:27.567,I wanna be here.
00:09:27.567,00:09:28.943,Then be here.
00:09:30.111,00:09:32.280,"Look at you, Peter."
00:09:32.280,00:09:35.033,Your grades have been steadily declining.
00:09:35.033,00:09:36.493,You're late for class.
00:09:36.493,00:09:37.911,You always...
00:09:37.911,00:09:39.371,appear exhausted.
00:09:40.788,00:09:42.499,Your paper on fusion is still overdue.
00:09:42.499,00:09:46.586,I know. I'm-- I'm planning to write it on Dr. Otto Octavius.
00:09:46.586,00:09:49.297,Planning is not a major at this university.
00:09:52.967,00:09:55.136,Octavius is a friend of mine.
00:09:55.136,00:09:57.764,"Better do your research, Parker."
00:09:57.764,00:10:01.560,"Get it done, or I'm failing you."
00:10:22.038,00:10:23.248,HARRY &amp; MARY JANE: Surprise!
00:10:23.248,00:10:24.583,Surprise!
00:10:24.583,00:10:26.000,"Well, say something."
00:10:26.000,00:10:27.168,"Uh, what's the occasion?"
00:10:27.168,00:10:28.795,"AUNT MAY: Oh, really, Peter."
00:10:28.795,00:10:30.755,It's your birthday!
00:10:30.755,00:10:33.258,Whether you want to remember it or not.
00:10:34.551,00:10:36.470,MARY JANE: He lives in another reality.
00:10:36.470,00:10:37.762,"Don't you, Pete?"
00:10:37.762,00:10:40.098,"Hi, M.J."
00:10:40.098,00:10:41.808,"Hey, buddy."
00:10:41.808,00:10:43.101,"Long time, no see."
00:10:44.018,00:10:46.020,"So, uh, how's the play?"
00:10:46.020,00:10:47.397,I read a great review.
00:10:47.397,00:10:48.982,It's going fine.
00:10:48.982,00:10:50.484,She's brilliant in it.
00:10:50.484,00:10:51.734,Harry sent me roses.
00:10:51.734,00:10:53.361,"HARRY: So where you been, pal?"
00:10:53.361,00:10:55.655,You don't return my calls.
00:10:56.448,00:10:58.366,I've been busy.
00:10:58.366,00:11:00.743,HARRY: Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
00:11:00.743,00:11:01.869,How's the bug these days?
00:11:01.869,00:11:05.081,"AUNT MAY: The less you see of that man, the better."
00:11:03.288,00:11:08.209,"Now, let's all go into the other room and have something to eat, hm?"
00:11:08.209,00:11:10.170,I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
00:11:10.170,00:11:11.588,So how are things going at OsCorp?
00:11:11.588,00:11:13.340,"Oh, they're great."
00:11:13.340,00:11:14.841,I'm head of Special Projects.
00:11:14.841,00:11:17.093,We're about to make a breakthrough on fusion.
00:11:17.093,00:11:18.553,"Oh, how lovely, Harry."
00:11:18.553,00:11:21.764,"Your father would be so proud, rest his soul."
00:11:21.764,00:11:23.224,Thank you.
00:11:23.224,00:11:25.519,"We're actually funding one of your idols, Pete."
00:11:25.519,00:11:27.061,Otto Octavius.
00:11:27.061,00:11:28.313,I'm writing a paper on him.
00:11:28.313,00:11:29.772,You want to meet him?
00:11:29.772,00:11:31.024,You'd introduce me?
00:11:31.024,00:11:32.651,You bet.
00:11:32.651,00:11:36.571,Octavius is gonna put OsCorp on the map in a way my father never even dreamed of.
00:11:36.571,00:11:38.198,"M.J., could you give me a hand?"
00:11:38.198,00:11:40.825,Huh? Oh.
00:11:40.825,00:11:43.203,"She's waiting for you, pal."
00:11:43.203,00:11:44.703,What do you mean?
00:11:44.703,00:11:49.334,"Oh, the way she looks at you or doesn't look at you, however you want to look at it."
00:11:49.334,00:11:51.961,I don't have time for girls right now.
00:11:51.961,00:11:53.171,"Why, are you dead?"
00:11:53.171,00:11:55.173,I've been kind of busy.
00:11:55.173,00:11:57.175,Taking pictures of your friend?
00:11:58.259,00:11:59.760,Could we get off that subject?
00:11:59.760,00:12:01.888,"I want us to be friends, Harry."
00:12:01.888,00:12:03.431,I want us to trust each other.
00:12:03.431,00:12:05.308,Then be honest with me.
00:12:05.308,00:12:08.562,"If you knew who he was, would you tell me?"
00:12:31.626,00:12:33.253,May.
00:12:33.253,00:12:36.047,"Oh, what, Ben? Hmm?"
00:12:36.047,00:12:38.132,Wait. Oh...
00:12:38.132,00:12:39.758,Aunt May.
00:12:39.758,00:12:41.844,"Oh, Peter."
00:12:41.844,00:12:45.557,"Oh, for a second there, I thought I was years ago."
00:12:47.684,00:12:49.561,"Everybody's gone, aren't they?"
00:12:49.561,00:12:51.730,Did they have a good time?
00:12:51.730,00:12:53.772,I'm sure they did.
00:12:55.442,00:12:57.694,You okay?
00:12:57.694,00:12:59.696,But you go home.
00:12:59.696,00:13:01.281,And be careful.
00:13:01.281,00:13:05.619,I don't like that scooter thing you drive around.
00:13:05.619,00:13:07.036,I'm worried about you.
00:13:07.036,00:13:08.913,You're so...
00:13:08.913,00:13:10.457,alone.
00:13:10.457,00:13:12.250,And I saw the letter from the bank.
00:13:12.250,00:13:13.543,"Oh, my."
00:13:13.543,00:13:15.503,You did?
00:13:15.503,00:13:16.795,"Oh, well."
00:13:16.795,00:13:18.923,So?
00:13:18.923,00:13:20.592,I'm a little behind.
00:13:20.592,00:13:23.136,Everybody is.
00:13:23.136,00:13:26.889,"Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore."
00:13:26.889,00:13:30.851,"I'm tired, and you better start back home."
00:13:31.978,00:13:34.105,"Here, kiddo."
00:13:34.105,00:13:35.356,Happy birthday.
00:13:35.356,00:13:37.150,You need it more than I do.
00:13:37.150,00:13:39.902,"No, I-- I can't take that from-- Yes, you can!"
00:13:39.902,00:13:41.988,You can take this money from me.
00:13:41.988,00:13:43.698,"For God's sake, it's not much."
00:13:43.698,00:13:44.991,"Now, take it!"
00:13:44.991,00:13:47.452,And don't you dare leave it here.
00:13:47.452,00:13:48.911,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:13:50.622,00:13:56.377,It's just that I miss your Uncle Ben so much.
00:13:56.377,00:13:57.796,Can you believe that it's...
00:13:57.796,00:14:01.257,two years next month since he was taken?
00:14:03.635,00:14:07.013,I think to myself at times...
00:14:07.013,00:14:12.393,"were I to face the one responsible for what happened, I'd..."
00:14:12.393,00:14:15.480,"Oh, I don't know what I'd do."
00:14:18.024,00:14:19.359,Oh...
00:14:20.485,00:14:21.820,Now...
00:14:24.071,00:14:26.949,you better take the rest of your cake home.
00:14:41.922,00:14:43.424,MARY JANE: Hey.
00:14:43.424,00:14:45.635,Hey.
00:14:46.803,00:14:48.555,I saw your billboard on Bleecker.
00:14:48.555,00:14:49.806,Isn't it funny?
00:14:49.806,00:14:52.016,I'm really kind of embarrassed.
00:14:52.016,00:14:54.185,Don't be.
00:14:54.185,00:14:56.187,get to see you every day now.
00:14:58.815,00:15:01.234,"I liked seeing you tonight, Peter."
00:15:03.361,00:15:05.321,"Oh, boy, yeah."
00:15:06.072,00:15:08.908,"Oh, boy, yeah what?"
00:15:13.204,00:15:14.539,Nothing.
00:15:19.335,00:15:22.422,Do you want to say something?
00:15:27.009,00:15:28.469,I...
00:15:34.768,00:15:35.852,was...
00:15:37.061,00:15:40.732,wondering i-if you're still in the Village.
00:15:49.490,00:15:52.118,You're such a mystery.
00:16:01.669,00:16:04.881,Peter.
00:16:04.881,00:16:06.466,What?
00:16:11.387,00:16:13.473,Happy birthday.
00:16:22.440,00:16:24.400,I'm seeing somebody now.
00:16:24.400,00:16:27.403,"You mean, like a boyfriend?"
00:16:28.321,00:16:29.739,"like, I like him."
00:16:31.908,00:16:32.951,Uh...
00:16:32.951,00:16:34.285,What?
00:16:34.994,00:16:35.995,Nothing.
00:16:37.580,00:16:40.667,"That's good, you know?"
00:16:42.460,00:16:44.295,Maybe more than that.
00:16:45.087,00:16:46.798,More?
00:16:47.841,00:16:49.133,I don't know.
00:16:50.593,00:16:52.512,I'm gonna come see your play tomorrow night.
00:16:53.471,00:16:55.473,Y...
00:16:55.473,00:16:57.308,You're coming?
00:16:57.308,00:16:58.643,I'll be there.
00:16:59.644,00:17:01.061,Don't disappoint me.
00:17:02.814,00:17:04.649,I won't.
00:17:18.579,00:17:20.122,MAN: Rent!
00:17:23.835,00:17:25.211,Hi.
00:17:25.211,00:17:26.420,Hi.
00:17:26.420,00:17:27.797,What's hi?
00:17:27.797,00:17:29.007,Uh...
00:17:29.007,00:17:31.217,I have a paycheck due this week and...
00:17:31.217,00:17:32.719,You're a month late again.
00:17:32.719,00:17:34.554,Again.
00:17:32.719,00:17:37.598,"I promise as soon as-- If promises were crackers, my daughter would be fat."
00:17:38.933,00:17:40.351,"I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch."
00:17:40.351,00:17:43.563,"You know, all I got is this 20 for the rest of the week-- Ah!"
00:17:43.563,00:17:45.606,Sorry doesn't pay the rent.
00:17:45.606,00:17:47.274,And don't try to sneak past me.
00:17:47.274,00:17:48.651,I have ears like a cat.
00:17:48.651,00:17:49.652,And eyes...
00:17:49.652,00:17:50.987,like a rodent.
00:17:52.405,00:17:54.073,"Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch."
00:17:54.073,00:17:54.991,"Hi, Pete."
00:17:54.991,00:17:56.409,Ah! Oh!
00:18:41.871,00:18:43.205,Hello?
00:18:50.880,00:18:52.172,Rent?
00:18:57.553,00:18:58.679,MAN: Doctor?
00:18:58.679,00:19:00.139,Mr. Osborn's here.
00:19:00.139,00:19:01.515,"HARRY: Nobel Prize, Otto."
00:19:01.515,00:19:04.727,"Nobel Prize, and we'll all be rich."
00:19:04.727,00:19:06.104,"It's not about the prizes, Harry."
00:19:06.104,00:19:08.481,"Nah, but you need money."
00:19:08.481,00:19:09.690,Who do we have here?
00:19:09.690,00:19:11.776,This is my good friend I called you about.
00:19:11.776,00:19:13.235,The guy who got me through high-school science.
00:19:13.235,00:19:15.195,"Peter Parker, sir."
00:19:15.195,00:19:20.534,"I'm writing a paper on you for-- Yes, yes, I know what you're doing here, but I really don't have time to talk to students right now."
00:19:21.619,00:19:23.329,But OsCorp pays the bills so...
00:19:23.329,00:19:24.497,HARRY: That's right.
00:19:23.329,00:19:27.249,"That's why I have to take off, board meeting, but my job is done here."
00:19:27.249,00:19:29.543,Got you two geniuses together.
00:19:29.543,00:19:31.838,"Good luck tomorrow, Otto."
00:19:32.880,00:19:34.214,We'll see you in Sweden.
00:19:36.634,00:19:38.511,"Interesting fellow, your friend."
00:19:38.511,00:19:41.639,"Well, I won't take much of your time-- Parker. Now I remember you."
00:19:41.639,00:19:43.766,You're Connors' student.
00:19:43.766,00:19:45.184,Tells me you're brilliant.
00:19:45.810,00:19:48.104,He also tells me you're lazy.
00:19:49.063,00:19:50.230,I'm trying to do better.
00:19:50.230,00:19:52.525,"You know, being brilliant's not enough, young man."
00:19:52.525,00:19:54.443,You have to work hard.
00:19:54.443,00:19:59.991,"Intelligence is not a privilege, it's a gift, and you use it for the good of mankind."
00:19:59.991,00:20:02.201,MAN: You wanna try back there?
00:20:02.201,00:20:03.911,So...is that it?
00:20:03.911,00:20:05.245,Yes.
00:20:05.245,00:20:08.582,My design to initiate and sustain fusion.
00:20:08.582,00:20:11.919,"Well, I understand you use harmonics of atomic frequencies."
00:20:11.919,00:20:13.420,Sympathetic frequencies.
00:20:13.420,00:20:15.923,Harmonic reinforcement?
00:20:15.923,00:20:18.134,Go on.
00:20:18.134,00:20:21.804,An exponential increase in energy output.
00:20:21.804,00:20:23.723,A huge amount of energy.
00:20:23.723,00:20:27.309,Like a perpetual sun providing renewable power for the whole world.
00:20:27.309,00:20:31.480,Are you sure you could stabilize the fusion reaction?
00:20:31.480,00:20:35.026,"Peter, what have we been talking about for the last hour and a half?"
00:20:35.026,00:20:37.361,This is my life's work.
00:20:37.361,00:20:40.781,I certainly know the consequences of the slightest miscalculation.
00:20:40.781,00:20:41.949,I'm sorry.
00:20:41.949,00:20:43.325,I didn't mean to question you.
00:20:43.325,00:20:46.829,"Rosie, our new friend thinks I'm gonna blow up the city."
00:20:46.829,00:20:48.789,You can sleep soundly tonight.
00:20:48.789,00:20:50.750,Otto's done his homework.
00:20:50.750,00:20:54.087,Come to the demonstration tomorrow and you'll see for yourself.
00:20:54.087,00:20:56.839,"And you need to sleep soundly tonight, Otto."
00:20:56.839,00:20:59.050,Did Edison sleep before he turned on the light?
00:20:59.050,00:21:01.719,Did Marconi sleep before he turned on the radio?
00:21:01.719,00:21:03.637,Did Beethoven sleep before he wrote the Fifth?
00:21:03.637,00:21:07.725,Did Bernoulli sleep before he found the curves of quickest descent?
00:21:07.725,00:21:09.977,"Ah, Rosie, I love this boy."
00:21:09.977,00:21:12.312,"Peter, tell us about yourself."
00:21:12.312,00:21:13.564,Do you have a girlfriend?
00:21:13.564,00:21:16.025,"Uh, well..."
00:21:17.944,00:21:19.570,I don't really know.
00:21:19.570,00:21:21.239,"Well, shouldn't you know?"
00:21:21.239,00:21:22.573,Who would know?
00:21:22.573,00:21:23.783,"Oh, leave him alone."
00:21:23.783,00:21:26.035,Maybe it's a secret love.
00:21:26.035,00:21:27.828,Love should never be a secret.
00:21:27.828,00:21:33.918,"If you keep something as complicated as love, stored up inside, gonna make you sick."
00:21:33.918,00:21:36.129,I finally got lucky in love.
00:21:36.129,00:21:37.838,We both did.
00:21:37.838,00:21:39.465,But it's hardly perfect.
00:21:39.465,00:21:41.092,You have to work at it.
00:21:41.092,00:21:45.054,I met him on the college steps and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.
00:21:45.054,00:21:48.599,"He was studying science, and I was studying English literature."
00:21:48.599,00:21:51.060,That's right. I was trying to explain the theory of relativity...
00:21:51.060,00:21:52.519,ROSIE: Mm-hmm.
00:21:52.519,00:21:54.814,and Rosie was trying to explain T.S. Eliot.
00:21:56.356,00:21:57.900,I still don't understand what he was talking about.
00:21:57.900,00:21:59.693,"Oh, come on. Yes, you do."
00:21:59.693,00:22:03.697,T.S. Eliot is more complicated than advanced science.
00:22:03.697,00:22:06.200,But if you want to get a woman to fall in love with you...
00:22:06.200,00:22:07.743,feed her poetry.
00:22:07.743,00:22:09.453,Poetry.
00:22:10.871,00:22:12.039,Never fails.
00:22:15.334,00:23:25.696,PETER: A tall and slender maiden all alone upon a prairie Brightest green Were all her garments And her hair Was like the sunshine Day by day He gazed upon her DITKOVITCH: Rent!
00:23:28.032,00:23:29.407,Where's my money?!
00:23:55.768,00:23:56.894,You seem jittery tonight.
00:23:56.894,00:23:58.104,Oh.
00:23:58.104,00:23:59.813,You never know who's coming.
00:24:15.371,00:24:16.580,"Ladies, five minutes."
00:24:16.580,00:24:18.874,Five minutes.
00:24:35.349,00:24:36.683,How'd you do that?
00:24:37.475,00:24:38.769,Uh...
00:24:39.686,00:24:42.106,"Work out, plenty of rest."
00:24:42.106,00:24:43.774,"You know, eat your green vegetables."
00:24:45.109,00:24:46.693,That's what my mom is always saying.
00:24:46.693,00:24:48.446,I just never actually believed her.
00:24:50.990,00:24:52.783,Come on. Go.
00:24:55.202,00:24:56.662,Keep it steady.
00:25:19.310,00:25:20.644,It's a web.
00:25:21.895,00:25:23.730,"Go, Spidey, go!"
00:25:27.818,00:25:29.153,Whoo!
00:25:32.031,00:25:34.116,We got trouble!
00:25:38.371,00:25:39.663,Hoo!
00:25:43.292,00:25:44.668,Oh!
00:25:47.921,00:25:49.340,Whoa!
00:25:50.924,00:25:54.303,Ah! Put me down! Ah!
00:25:54.303,00:25:57.431,I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.
00:25:57.431,00:26:00.684,His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
00:26:00.684,00:26:02.644,Then you think we should forgive them?
00:26:05.647,00:26:06.982,Yes.
00:26:07.983,00:26:10.361,"I mean, no."
00:26:13.322,00:26:14.698,Hey.
00:26:14.698,00:26:15.991,Hey.
00:26:15.991,00:26:18.702,"If you park there, I'm towing it."
00:26:18.702,00:26:20.037,Whatever.
00:26:22.206,00:26:23.499,"Uh, shoelace."
00:26:28.921,00:26:31.090,You might wanna...
00:26:35.719,00:26:36.762,Can I help you?
00:26:36.762,00:26:39.014,"Yeah, I, uh..."
00:26:39.014,00:26:40.224,Come to see the show.
00:26:40.224,00:26:41.975,"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."
00:26:41.975,00:26:44.061,No one will be seated after the doors are closed.
00:26:45.187,00:26:47.314,It helps maintain the illusion.
00:26:48.232,00:26:51.235,"Uh, Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine."
00:26:51.235,00:26:52.445,She asked me to come.
00:26:52.445,00:26:53.779,But not to come late.
00:26:55.822,00:26:58.492,"Well, I have to see this show."
00:26:55.822,00:26:59.910,"Just let me in, I'll stand in the-- Shh."
00:27:01.619,00:27:03.205,ACTRESS: Darling.
00:27:04.540,00:27:05.999,Mm.
00:27:43.537,00:27:44.871,Hey.
00:27:44.871,00:27:46.415,Sure you don't wanna come tonight?
00:27:46.415,00:27:47.374,"Yeah, I'm sure."
00:27:47.374,00:27:48.417,Yeah?
00:27:48.417,00:27:50.294,Okay. Call me.
00:27:50.294,00:27:51.878,You were great tonight.
00:27:54.381,00:27:55.882,"MAN: May I have an autograph, please, miss?"
00:27:58.260,00:27:59.595,What are you doing here?
00:28:14.818,00:28:16.028,You hungry?
00:28:16.028,00:28:17.488,Starved.
00:28:36.298,00:28:37.633,Yah!
00:28:55.317,00:28:56.318,Huh? Ah!
00:28:59.196,00:29:00.531,Oomph!
00:29:07.913,00:29:09.248,What was that?
00:29:14.294,00:29:15.629,Okay.
00:29:31.437,00:29:32.771,Huh.
00:29:55.919,00:29:57.546,Cool Spidey outfit.
00:29:59.172,00:30:00.507,Thanks.
00:30:02.426,00:30:03.719,Where'd you get it?
00:30:05.053,00:30:06.597,I-I made it.
00:30:07.847,00:30:09.182,Hm.
00:30:10.517,00:30:12.144,Looks uncomfortable.
00:30:13.395,00:30:15.731,"Yeah, it gets kind of itchy."
00:30:18.984,00:30:21.695,And it rides up in the crotch a little bit too.
00:31:10.619,00:31:12.621,"MAN: The other way, the other way!"
00:31:12.621,00:31:14.414,"MARY JANE: Hi, it's me."
00:31:14.414,00:31:16.750,Sing your song at the beep.
00:31:16.750,00:31:19.837,"Hi, M.J. This is Peter."
00:31:19.837,00:31:23.048,"I was on my way to your show, and..."
00:31:24.090,00:31:25.467,Well...
00:31:25.467,00:31:27.386,I was on my bike...
00:31:27.386,00:31:28.762,Uh...
00:31:30.806,00:31:32.307,Are you there?
00:31:34.810,00:31:37.688,I really was planning on it all day.
00:31:38.731,00:31:40.607,And...
00:31:41.859,00:31:44.444,I know you predicted I'd disappoint you.
00:31:44.444,00:31:45.779,Bingo.
00:31:47.447,00:31:49.742,"It's amazing, isn't it?"
00:31:49.742,00:31:53.912,How complicated a simple thing...
00:31:53.912,00:31:55.247,like...
00:31:55.247,00:31:59.042,being someplace at 8:00 can become.
00:32:01.795,00:32:03.463,Actually...
00:32:03.463,00:32:05.674,there was this obnoxious usher.
00:32:05.674,00:32:08.719,"Somebody has to talk to that usher, M.J."
00:32:09.887,00:32:11.971,OPERATOR: Your time has expired.
00:32:11.971,00:32:15.809,Please deposit 50 cents for the next five minutes.
00:32:25.611,00:32:27.613,I wanna tell you the truth.
00:32:29.740,00:32:32.033,Here it is.
00:32:32.033,00:32:34.870,I'm Spider-Man.
00:32:34.870,00:32:36.496,"Weird, huh?"
00:32:38.457,00:32:41.710,Now you know why I can't be with you.
00:32:41.710,00:32:42.878,If my...
00:32:42.878,00:32:44.797,enemies...
00:32:44.797,00:32:46.298,found out about you...
00:32:49.175,00:32:52.554,"if you got hurt, I could never forgive myself."
00:32:58.310,00:33:01.647,I wish I could tell you how I feel about you.
00:33:11.406,00:33:13.074,"MAN: Hello, Dave."
00:33:13.074,00:33:14.159,OCTAVIUS: Ladies and gentlemen...
00:33:14.159,00:33:18.204,my wife Rosie and I would like to welcome you this afternoon.
00:33:18.204,00:33:25.253,"But first, before we start, has anybody lost a large roll of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?"
00:33:25.253,00:33:26.463,Because we found the rubber band.
00:33:31.217,00:33:32.719,It's a terrible joke.
00:33:32.719,00:33:34.721,But thank you for coming.
00:33:34.721,00:33:36.264,Today...
00:33:36.264,00:33:41.019,you will witness the birth of a new fusion-based energy source.
00:33:41.019,00:33:46.274,"Safe, renewable energy and cheap electricity for everyone."
00:33:47.693,00:33:50.737,And now let me introduce my assistants.
00:33:58.620,00:34:05.377,These four actuators were developed and programmed for the sole purpose of creating successful fusion.
00:34:05.377,00:34:07.880,They are impervious to heat and magnetism.
00:34:52.632,00:34:57.721,OCTAVIUS: These smart arms are controlled by my brain through a neural link.
00:34:57.721,00:35:07.606,"Nanowires feed directly into my cerebellum, allowing me to use these arms to control fusion reaction in an environment no human hand could enter."
00:35:07.606,00:35:15.113,"Doctor, if the artificial intelligence in the arms is as advanced as you suggest, uh, couldn't that make you vulnerable to them?"
00:35:15.113,00:35:16.531,How right you are.
00:35:16.531,00:35:21.244,Which is why I developed this inhibitor chip to protect my higher brain function.
00:35:21.244,00:35:26.458,"It means I maintain control of these arms, instead of them controlling me."
00:35:26.458,00:35:28.418,"And now, on to the main event."
00:35:28.418,00:35:30.295,"Give me the blue light, Rosie."
00:35:49.731,00:35:53.860,Precious tritium is the fuel that makes this project go.
00:35:53.860,00:35:57.614,There's only 25 pounds of it on the whole planet.
00:35:57.614,00:36:01.994,I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and OsCorp Industries for providing it.
00:36:01.994,00:36:03.954,"Happy to pay the bills, Otto."
00:36:17.634,00:36:19.136,Ladies and gentlemen...
00:36:21.888,00:36:23.640,fasten your seat belts.
00:36:42.325,00:36:45.037,"Doctor, we have a successful fusion reaction."
00:36:49.708,00:36:52.919,This is a breakthrough beyond your father's dreams.
00:36:52.919,00:36:54.671,Thank you.
00:36:54.671,00:36:56.381,ASSISTANT: We're producing a thousand-megawatt surplus.
00:37:04.305,00:37:06.850,The power of the sun...
00:37:06.850,00:37:09.019,in the palm of my hand.
00:37:30.540,00:37:31.958,Keep calm!
00:37:31.958,00:37:33.126,It's only a spike!
00:37:33.126,00:37:34.836,It'll soon stabilize!
00:37:40.550,00:37:42.135,Pete.
00:37:40.550,00:37:43.845,"ROSIE: Ladies and gentlemen, please clear the room."
00:37:49.308,00:37:50.727,We have a containment breach.
00:37:50.727,00:37:52.645,Huh?
00:37:53.438,00:37:55.648,"Otto, please get back!"
00:37:56.775,00:37:59.569,"Shut it off, Otto!"
00:37:59.569,00:38:02.530,It will stabilize!
00:38:02.530,00:38:04.574,I'm in charge here!
00:38:04.574,00:38:06.118,It's my money.
00:38:06.118,00:38:12.290,I'm in con-- This doesn't change anything.
00:38:16.211,00:38:18.713,What are you doing?
00:38:18.713,00:38:19.839,No!
00:38:39.276,00:38:40.401,Rosie!
00:38:42.528,00:38:43.863,Huh?
00:39:11.349,00:39:13.143,PARAMEDIC: Watch it.
00:39:13.143,00:39:14.477,MAN: That was too close.
00:39:14.477,00:39:17.897,"If he had more than a drop of tritium, he could've destroyed the city."
00:39:24.196,00:39:25.446,I'm ruined.
00:39:27.324,00:39:29.534,"I have nothing left, except Spider-Man."
00:39:29.534,00:39:31.744,"MAN: He saved your life, sir."
00:39:31.744,00:39:34.372,He humiliated me by touching me.
00:39:34.372,00:39:36.166,"Mr. Osborn, the press'll be here soon."
00:39:36.166,00:39:37.334,I suggest we move on.
00:39:37.334,00:39:39.085,"What was he doing here, anyway?"
00:39:54.726,00:40:02.901,"DOCTOR: As you can see, molten metal penetrated the spinal cavity and fused the vertebrae at multiple points, including the lamina and the roof of the spinal column."
00:40:02.901,00:40:14.537,"We won't know the extent of the damage until we get in there, so I suggest we cut off these mechanical arms, slice up the harness, and if need be, consider a laminectomy with posterior spinal fusion from C-7, T-1 to T-12."
00:40:14.537,00:40:15.955,"NURSE: We're ready, Doctor."
00:40:19.417,00:40:21.044,Anybody here take shop class?
00:40:57.705,00:40:59.874,Noooo!
00:40:59.874,00:41:04.712,No! No! No-- Help me!
00:41:04.712,00:41:06.005,Help me!
00:42:17.035,00:42:22.040,Noooooooo!
00:43:11.464,00:43:13.466,"JAMESON: It's all over town, Robbie."
00:43:13.466,00:43:15.385,Gossip. Rumors.
00:43:15.385,00:43:17.720,"Panic in the streets, if we're lucky."
00:43:17.720,00:43:20.432,Crazy scientist turns himself into some kind of a monster.
00:43:20.432,00:43:22.767,Four mechanical arms welded right onto his body.
00:43:24.269,00:43:27.272,Guy named Otto Octavius winds up with eight limbs.
00:43:27.272,00:43:28.856,What are the odds?
00:43:28.856,00:43:30.233,Hoffman!
00:43:31.859,00:43:33.236,What're we gonna call this guy?
00:43:33.236,00:43:34.653,"Uh, uh, Dr. Octopus."
00:43:34.653,00:43:35.654,That's crap.
00:43:35.654,00:43:36.739,"Oh, uh, Science Squid?"
00:43:36.739,00:43:37.782,Crap.
00:43:37.782,00:43:39.200,Dr. Strange.
00:43:39.200,00:43:40.535,That's pretty good.
00:43:40.535,00:43:41.786,But it's taken.
00:43:41.786,00:43:43.162,"Wait, wait. I got it."
00:43:43.162,00:43:44.789,Dr. Octopus.
00:43:44.789,00:43:46.249,B-but-- I like it.
00:43:46.249,00:43:47.417,Of course you do.
00:43:47.417,00:43:48.585,Dr. Octopus.
00:43:48.585,00:43:49.961,New villain in town.
00:43:49.961,00:43:51.337,Doc Ock.
00:43:51.337,00:43:52.630,Genius.
00:43:52.630,00:43:53.923,"What, are you looking for a raise?"
00:43:53.923,00:43:55.341,Get out.
00:43:55.341,00:43:57.093,"Chief, I found Parker."
00:43:57.093,00:43:58.595,Where you been?
00:43:58.595,00:44:00.221,Why don't you pay your phone bill?
00:44:00.221,00:44:02.056,Mad scientist goes berserk and we don't have pictures!
00:44:02.056,00:44:03.600,I heard Spider-Man was there.
00:44:03.600,00:44:06.936,"JAMESON: Where were you, photographing squirrels?"
00:44:06.936,00:44:08.854,"Chief, the planetarium party."
00:44:08.854,00:44:10.982,"Oh, right. You're un-fired."
00:44:10.982,00:44:12.442,What do you know about high society?
00:44:12.442,00:44:15.736,"Oh. Uh, well, I-- Ah, don't answer that."
00:44:14.068,00:44:17.530,My society photographer got hit in the head by a polo ball.
00:44:17.530,00:44:18.573,You're all I got.
00:44:18.573,00:44:20.158,Big party for an American hero.
00:44:20.158,00:44:21.576,"My son, the astronaut."
00:44:21.576,00:44:24.203,But could you pay me in advance?
00:44:32.003,00:44:33.338,You serious?
00:44:33.338,00:44:35.131,"Pay you for what, standing there?"
00:44:35.131,00:44:37.925,"The planetarium, tomorrow night, 8:00. There's the door."
00:44:52.773,00:44:54.900,My Rosie's dead.
00:44:56.777,00:44:58.821,My dream is dead.
00:45:02.158,00:45:03.826,And these...
00:45:05.453,00:45:09.081,monstrous things should be at the bottom of the river...
00:45:12.043,00:45:13.378,along with me.
00:45:22.094,00:45:23.638,Something...
00:45:25.223,00:45:27.266,in my head.
00:45:30.395,00:45:32.313,Something talking.
00:45:36.192,00:45:37.485,The inhibitor chip!
00:45:40.821,00:45:42.615,Gone.
00:45:47.370,00:45:49.622,Rebuild.
00:45:51.708,00:45:53.042,No.
00:45:54.877,00:45:56.629,Peter was right.
00:45:58.715,00:46:01.342,I miscalculated.
00:46:06.931,00:46:10.184,I couldn't have miscalculated.
00:46:10.184,00:46:11.728,"It was working, wasn't it?"
00:46:16.815,00:46:18.067,Yes.
00:46:19.235,00:46:20.445,We could rebuild.
00:46:20.445,00:46:22.530,Enlarge the containment field.
00:46:22.530,00:46:25.824,Make it bigger and stronger than ever.
00:46:25.824,00:46:27.285,But we need money.
00:46:28.953,00:46:30.705,Steal it?
00:46:30.705,00:46:32.039,"No, no, no, I'm not a criminal."
00:46:35.251,00:46:38.379,That's right.
00:46:38.379,00:46:41.840,The real crime would be not to finish what we started.
00:46:45.344,00:46:47.430,We'll do it here.
00:46:47.430,00:46:50.891,The power of the sun in the palm of my hand.
00:46:50.891,00:46:53.852,Nothing will stand in our way.
00:46:53.852,00:46:55.521,Nothing!
00:47:00.817,00:47:02.320,AUNT MAY: That's the Social Security.
00:47:02.320,00:47:03.529,"Yes, I see."
00:47:03.529,00:47:05.364,My Uncle Ben's life insurance.
00:47:05.364,00:47:06.449,Yes.
00:47:06.449,00:47:11.162,But I'm afraid it's just not sufficient to refinance your home.
00:47:11.162,00:47:12.538,"Oh, but..."
00:47:12.538,00:47:14.499,I'm giving piano lessons again.
00:47:14.499,00:47:15.832,You are?
00:47:16.375,00:47:18.043,Ow!
00:47:18.043,00:47:20.129,"Oh, ow..."
00:47:20.129,00:47:21.380,Wh--?
00:47:21.380,00:47:24.883,W-we appreciate that you've just opened up a...
00:47:24.883,00:47:27.345,A new supersaver account with us today.
00:47:27.345,00:47:31.265,"But the fact is, you do not have the assets to justify this loan."
00:47:31.974,00:47:33.976,I'm sorry.
00:47:33.976,00:47:35.353,Well...
00:47:37.480,00:47:39.273,at least we get the toaster.
00:47:39.273,00:47:43.695,"Actually, that's only with a deposit of, uh, 300 or more."
00:47:43.695,00:47:45.029,Oh...
00:47:46.071,00:47:47.657,"Oh, yes, I see."
00:47:48.658,00:47:49.992,Okay.
00:47:53.746,00:47:55.872,"Don't worry, we'll figure it out."
00:48:06.300,00:48:07.635,Rrah!
00:48:12.765,00:48:14.475,Peter?
00:48:16.143,00:48:17.478,Don't leave me.
00:48:19.355,00:48:21.940,"Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero."
00:48:21.940,00:48:23.234,MAN: Hold it!
00:48:24.193,00:48:25.528,Put your arms up!
00:48:25.528,00:48:26.987,All of them!
00:48:29.323,00:48:30.616,Ooh!
00:48:46.841,00:48:48.133,Hah!
00:48:50.469,00:48:51.470,Here's your change!
00:49:01.063,00:49:02.774,"Oh, no. Come on!"
00:49:03.524,00:49:04.567,Ah!
00:49:04.567,00:49:05.777,Ha!
00:49:10.281,00:49:11.657,Uh-bup-bup.
00:49:11.657,00:49:12.991,Ow!
00:49:15.952,00:49:17.371,You're getting on my nerves.
00:49:17.371,00:49:19.331,I have a knack for that.
00:49:26.714,00:49:28.006,Rrah!
00:49:28.716,00:49:29.759,Ah?
00:49:40.394,00:49:41.687,Hyuh!
00:49:42.605,00:49:44.148,Hyah!
00:49:49.528,00:49:50.571,Freeze! Don't move!
00:49:50.571,00:49:51.948,Freeze!
00:49:55.451,00:49:56.494,Hold your fire.
00:49:56.494,00:49:57.536,Don't follow me.
00:49:57.536,00:49:58.913,AUNT MAY: Oh!
00:50:00.915,00:50:02.834,Wait a second.
00:50:02.834,00:50:05.461,"WOMAN: So that won't be charged to my card for seven days, right?"
00:50:05.461,00:50:06.963,Thank you so much.
00:50:20.726,00:50:21.894,Hand her over.
00:50:21.894,00:50:23.145,Of course.
00:50:23.145,00:50:24.438,Easy now.
00:50:26.732,00:50:27.859,Butterfingers.
00:50:37.033,00:50:38.828,Oh! Ooh. Oh...
00:50:40.872,00:50:42.122,Look out!
00:50:44.082,00:50:45.417,Help me!
00:50:48.128,00:50:49.087,Help me!
00:50:49.087,00:50:50.088,I'm coming!
00:50:56.094,00:50:57.471,Hang on!
00:51:15.740,00:51:17.282,Help!
00:51:37.219,00:51:39.263,Thank you.
00:51:41.557,00:51:42.600,Aunt May.
00:51:42.600,00:51:46.437,You've stuck your webs in my business for the last time.
00:51:46.437,00:51:49.774,Now you'll have this woman's death on your conscience.
00:51:55.111,00:51:56.238,Come on.
00:52:00.701,00:52:02.078,Shame on you.
00:52:19.804,00:52:21.388,Whoooo!
00:52:35.235,00:52:36.236,There you go.
00:52:37.696,00:52:39.698,"Oh, thank you."
00:52:39.698,00:52:41.533,"Oh, have I been wrong about you."
00:52:41.533,00:52:43.035,We sure showed him.
00:52:43.035,00:52:44.912,What do you mean we?
00:52:44.912,00:52:46.288,Oh.
00:52:48.624,00:52:50.126,"Take me with you, Spider-Man!"
00:52:50.126,00:52:51.085,"No, take me!"
00:53:14.859,00:53:16.192,Excuse me.
00:53:18.612,00:53:19.697,May I?
00:53:19.697,00:53:21.448,"Sure, go ahead."
00:53:22.240,00:53:23.575,"MAN: Penny, over here!"
00:53:29.832,00:53:31.207,HARRY: Leave it.
00:53:34.962,00:53:36.130,Hey.
00:53:36.130,00:53:37.673,"Might want to take it easy, buddy."
00:53:37.673,00:53:39.215,Why? It's a party.
00:53:39.215,00:53:46.098,Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost a bundle on some crackpot who you thought was gonna take you with him to fame and fortune?
00:53:46.098,00:53:47.599,"Not to mention your friend, the bug."
00:53:48.350,00:53:49.685,"Not tonight, Harry."
00:53:49.685,00:53:50.895,Every night.
00:53:50.895,00:53:53.355,"Until I find him, it's 24/7."
00:53:53.355,00:53:55.273,JAMESON: Parker!
00:53:55.273,00:53:57.568,Parker!
00:53:57.568,00:53:59.528,"Parker! What, are you deaf?"
00:53:59.528,00:54:01.072,I called you twice.
00:53:59.528,00:54:02.865,"Come on, what do you think, I'm paying you to sit around and sip champagne?"
00:54:02.865,00:54:05.076,"Here, get a shot of my wife with the minister here."
00:54:05.076,00:54:06.535,Beautiful tie.
00:54:06.535,00:54:09.245,"Ooh, no, get a shot of us with the D.A."
00:54:09.245,00:54:11.207,"Oh, beautiful dress."
00:54:11.207,00:54:14.043,"Ooh, here, get a shot of the mayor and his girlfriend."
00:54:15.251,00:54:16.712,Wife.
00:54:18.923,00:54:21.466,"WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, good evening."
00:54:21.466,00:54:27.056,The committee for the Science Library of New York is pleased to present our guest of honor.
00:54:27.056,00:54:29.183,He's the first man to play...
00:54:29.183,00:54:30.809,football on the moon.
00:54:32.061,00:54:37.273,"The handsome, the heroic, the delicious, Captain John Jameson."
00:54:41.946,00:54:43.739,MAN: Johnny!
00:55:21.610,00:55:22.903,Hi.
00:55:24.488,00:55:25.781,Oh.
00:55:25.781,00:55:27.574,You.
00:55:27.574,00:55:29.034,I'm sorry.
00:55:29.034,00:55:31.578,But there was a disturbance.
00:55:31.578,00:55:32.913,I don't know you.
00:55:34.873,00:55:37.668,And I can't keep thinking about you.
00:55:37.668,00:55:38.919,It's too painful.
00:55:38.919,00:55:41.546,I've been reading poetry lately.
00:55:41.546,00:55:43.048,Whatever that means.
00:55:43.048,00:55:51.640,Day by day he gazed upon her Day by day He sighed with passion Day by day-- Don't start.
00:55:53.851,00:55:55.519,Can I get you a drink?
00:55:55.519,00:55:57.896,I'm with John.
00:55:57.896,00:55:59.564,John.
00:55:59.564,00:56:03.694,"By the way, John has seen my show five times."
00:56:03.694,00:56:06.655,Harry has seen it twice.
00:56:06.655,00:56:09.407,My sick mother got out of bed to see it.
00:56:09.407,00:56:11.076,Even my father.
00:56:12.286,00:56:15.080,He came backstage to borrow cash.
00:56:16.581,00:56:23.672,"But my best friend, who cares so much about me, can't make an 8:00 curtain."
00:56:25.007,00:56:26.508,After all these years...
00:56:27.968,00:56:31.013,he's nothing to me but an empty seat.
00:56:55.620,00:56:59.499,"You know, it pisses me off, your loyalty to Spider-Man and not to your best friend."
00:56:59.499,00:57:03.087,"I find him with my father's body, and you defend him because he's your bread and butter."
00:57:03.087,00:57:05.005,"Hey, take it easy."
00:57:05.005,00:57:07.007,Don't act like you're my friend.
00:57:07.007,00:57:10.052,You stole M.J. from me.
00:57:10.052,00:57:12.763,You stole my father's love.
00:57:12.763,00:57:16.558,Then you let him die because you didn't turn in the freak.
00:57:16.558,00:57:17.768,Isn't that right?
00:57:18.769,00:57:19.853,Huh?!
00:57:19.853,00:57:21.021,Isn't that right?
00:57:21.021,00:57:22.356,"Huh, brother?"
00:57:33.367,00:57:36.870,"JOHN: Ladies and gentlemen, I just want you all to know that the..."
00:57:36.870,00:57:41.917,beautiful Miss Mary Jane Watson has just agreed to marry me.
00:57:52.219,00:57:54.054,MAN: What a surprise.
00:57:54.054,00:57:55.680,"Parker, wake up!"
00:57:55.680,00:57:57.141,Wake up!
00:58:24.209,00:58:25.502,"Oh, no. No!"
00:58:25.502,00:58:26.878,Ah!
00:58:37.639,00:58:40.017,Why is this happening to me?
01:00:02.140,01:00:04.893,Ahhhhhh...
01:00:07.145,01:00:09.814,You seem very okay to me.
01:00:09.814,01:00:13.193,My diagnosis: It's up here.
01:00:15.737,01:00:17.448,You say you can't sleep.
01:00:17.448,01:00:19.741,Heartbreak?
01:00:20.784,01:00:24.162,"T-there is one dream, where..."
01:00:24.162,01:00:26.831,in my dream...
01:00:26.831,01:00:28.125,I'm Spider-Man.
01:00:28.125,01:00:29.709,But I'm losing my powers.
01:00:29.709,01:00:33.171,"I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling."
01:00:33.171,01:00:34.672,Oh.
01:00:36.883,01:00:38.427,So you're Spider-Man.
01:00:38.427,01:00:40.053,In my dream.
01:00:40.053,01:00:42.764,"Well, actually, i-it's not even my dream."
01:00:42.764,01:00:44.308,It's a friend of mine's dream.
01:00:44.308,01:00:46.393,Oh...
01:00:46.393,01:00:48.186,Somebody else's dream.
01:00:53.984,01:00:55.277,What about this friend?
01:00:56.320,01:00:57.613,Why does he climb these walls?
01:00:57.613,01:01:00.073,What does he think of himself?
01:01:00.073,01:01:02.242,"Well, that's the problem."
01:01:02.242,01:01:04.828,know what to think.
01:01:04.828,01:01:06.955,Gotta make you mad not to know who you are.
01:01:06.955,01:01:08.248,Your soul disappears.
01:01:08.248,01:01:10.542,Nothing as bad as uncertainty.
01:01:10.542,01:01:13.545,Listen...
01:01:13.545,01:01:15.297,maybe you're not supposed to be...
01:01:15.297,01:01:17.715,Spider-Man climbing those walls.
01:01:17.715,01:01:20.177,That's why you keep falling.
01:01:22.304,01:01:24.973,"You always have a choice, Peter."
01:01:26.433,01:01:28.560,I have a choice.
01:01:37.235,01:01:41.239,"UNCLE BEN: All the things you've been thinking about, Peter..."
01:01:41.239,01:01:42.782,make me sad.
01:01:44.284,01:01:46.953,Can't you understand?
01:01:46.953,01:01:49.914,I'm in love with Mary Jane.
01:01:49.914,01:01:55.128,"Peter, all the times we've talked of honesty, fairness..."
01:01:55.128,01:01:56.380,justice...
01:01:56.380,01:02:07.015,"All of those times, I counted on you to have the courage to take those dreams out into the world."
01:02:07.015,01:02:10.935,I can't live your dreams anymore.
01:02:10.935,01:02:12.770,I want a life of my own.
01:02:12.770,01:02:15.065,"You've been given a gift, Peter."
01:02:15.065,01:02:19.695,"With great power, comes great responsibility."
01:02:24.157,01:02:26.117,"Take my hand, son."
01:02:38.838,01:02:41.091,"No, Uncle Ben."
01:02:42.842,01:02:45.345,I'm just Peter Parker.
01:02:46.804,01:02:49.391,I'm Spider-Man...
01:02:49.391,01:02:50.975,no more.
01:02:51.976,01:02:53.811,No more.
01:03:01.778,01:03:03.614,No more.
01:04:30.116,01:04:31.451,MAN: Hey!
01:04:32.661,01:04:33.704,You punk!
01:04:33.704,01:04:35.497,Sorry.
01:04:35.497,01:04:36.914,Thanks.
01:04:55.433,01:04:58.936,"DR. CONNORS: And when the borderline is tau equals zero, the eigen values are?"
01:04:58.936,01:05:00.647,"Someone, please?"
01:05:03.316,01:05:07.278,.23 electron volts.
01:05:11.032,01:05:12.826,"Excellent work today, Parker."
01:05:12.826,01:05:13.910,Keep it up.
01:05:24.337,01:05:26.297,"Well, I'm not really wicked at all, Cousin Cecily."
01:05:26.297,01:05:27.382,You mustn't think that I'm wicked.
01:05:27.382,01:05:32.387,"If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner."
01:05:32.387,01:05:38.184,"I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time."
01:05:38.184,01:05:40.270,That would be hypocrisy.
01:05:40.270,01:05:43.356,Oh. Of course I have been rather reckless.
01:05:49.070,01:05:50.488,I am glad.
01:05:51.948,01:05:53.491,I am glad.
01:05:53.491,01:05:55.577,I am glad.
01:05:57.412,01:06:00.081,Are you glad to hear it?
01:06:00.791,01:06:01.750,Uh...
01:06:01.750,01:06:03.668,I am glad...
01:06:03.668,01:06:04.628,to hear it.
01:06:04.628,01:06:11.509,"In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own small way."
01:06:13.553,01:06:14.846,You were so wonderful.
01:06:14.846,01:06:18.892,That was such a great play. I-- You could've told me you were coming.
01:06:18.892,01:06:20.852,"I was afraid you'd say, Don't come."
01:06:24.564,01:06:27.233,You look different.
01:06:27.233,01:06:32.280,"I...shined my shoes, pressed my pants, did my homework."
01:06:32.280,01:06:36.200,I do my homework now.
01:06:36.200,01:06:38.119,You wanna get some chow mein?
01:06:38.119,01:06:39.663,Peter...
01:06:39.663,01:06:41.665,I'm getting married.
01:06:46.670,01:06:49.464,I always imagined you getting married on a hilltop.
01:06:49.464,01:06:51.591,And who's the groom?
01:06:51.591,01:06:53.593,You hadn't decided yet.
01:06:54.970,01:07:00.934,You think just because you saw my play you can talk me out of getting married?
01:07:00.934,01:07:02.853,You once told me you loved me.
01:07:02.853,01:07:04.604,I let things get in the way before.
01:07:04.604,01:07:06.272,There was something I thought I had to do.
01:07:06.272,01:07:08.316,I don't have to.
01:07:08.316,01:07:09.609,You're too late.
01:07:10.986,01:07:12.153,Will you think about it?
01:07:12.153,01:07:13.947,Think about what?
01:07:13.947,01:07:15.699,Picking up where we left off.
01:07:15.699,01:07:18.368,Where was that?!
01:07:18.368,01:07:20.453,"You can't get off if you don't get on, Peter."
01:07:20.453,01:07:22.121,I don't think it's that simple.
01:07:22.121,01:07:24.248,"Of course you don't, because you complicate things."
01:07:24.248,01:07:25.333,You don't understand.
01:07:26.626,01:07:29.462,I'm not an empty seat anymore.
01:07:29.462,01:07:30.839,I'm different.
01:07:30.839,01:07:34.342,"Punch me, I bleed."
01:07:40.640,01:07:42.600,I have to go.
01:07:49.440,01:07:52.318,I'm getting married in a church.
01:07:59.325,01:08:00.702,You are different.
01:08:15.341,01:08:18.595,"JAMESON: Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding, not go into bankruptcy."
01:08:19.429,01:08:20.513,Caviar?!
01:08:20.513,01:08:22.223,"What, are we inviting the czar?"
01:08:22.223,01:08:25.184,"Get some cheese and crackers, some of those little cocktail weenies."
01:08:25.184,01:08:28.271,"Boss, I got a garbage man here who says he's got something you might wanna see."
01:08:28.271,01:08:32.943,"Don't tell me you have the head of an extraterrestrial in there, because if you do, you're the third guy this week."
01:08:34.861,01:08:36.988,ROBBIE: Where the hell did you get that?
01:08:36.988,01:08:38.448,In the garbage.
01:08:38.448,01:08:40.241,In the garbage?
01:08:41.952,01:08:43.995,He must've given up.
01:08:43.995,01:08:45.622,Thrown in the towel.
01:08:45.622,01:08:47.832,Abandoned his sad little masquerade.
01:08:49.793,01:08:51.002,I finally got to him.
01:08:51.002,01:08:52.963,The power of the press triumphs.
01:08:52.963,01:08:55.632,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:08:55.632,01:08:58.051,I think I deserve a little something for this.
01:08:58.051,01:08:59.343,I'll give you 50 bucks.
01:08:59.343,01:09:01.220,I could get more than that on eBay.
01:09:01.220,01:09:05.100,"All right, 100. Miss Brant, give this man his money, and throw in a bar of soap."
01:09:05.100,01:09:07.268,Your wife is still on that line.
01:09:07.268,01:09:10.480,WOMAN: --about the flowers-- Flowers! How much?
01:09:08.561,01:09:13.942,"It'll cost you-- You spend any more on this thing, you can pick the daisies off my grave."
01:09:13.942,01:09:15.359,Get plastic!
01:09:16.611,01:09:17.821,Gotta go.
01:09:46.766,01:09:47.851,"MAN 2: Come on, man."
01:09:47.851,01:09:50.436,Get the money.
01:09:50.436,01:09:52.105,"Come on, come on."
01:09:52.105,01:09:53.523,Ah!
01:09:54.983,01:09:55.817,Help!
01:10:00.530,01:10:02.323,Come on.
01:10:03.033,01:10:04.367,Come on.
01:10:07.787,01:10:10.540,AUNT MAY: It wasn't fair to have gone like that.
01:10:10.540,01:10:13.250,He was a peaceful man.
01:10:15.003,01:10:17.296,And it was all my doing.
01:10:50.080,01:10:51.581,Aunt May...
01:10:51.581,01:10:53.374,you don't have to punish yourself.
01:10:53.374,01:10:56.044,"Oh, I know I shouldn't."
01:10:56.044,01:10:57.212,It's just that...
01:10:57.212,01:11:01.591,"you wanted to take the subway, and he wanted to drive you."
01:11:01.591,01:11:08.389,"And if only I had stopped him, we'd all three of us be having tea together."
01:11:23.738,01:11:26.282,I'm responsible.
01:11:29.119,01:11:31.121,For what?
01:11:31.121,01:11:33.456,For what happened to Uncle Ben.
01:11:33.456,01:11:36.209,But...you were at the library.
01:11:36.209,01:11:38.211,You were doing your homework.
01:11:38.211,01:11:42.048,"He drove me to the library, but I never went in."
01:11:42.048,01:11:44.383,What do you mean?
01:11:44.383,01:11:46.844,I went someplace else.
01:11:46.844,01:11:50.306,Someplace where I thought I could win some money...
01:11:50.306,01:11:54.560,"to buy a car, because I wanted to..."
01:11:54.560,01:11:56.813,impress Mary Jane.
01:11:58.355,01:12:02.026,It happened so fast.
01:12:02.026,01:12:04.195,"I won the money, and the guy wouldn't pay me."
01:12:04.195,01:12:07.573,Then he got robbed.
01:12:07.573,01:12:09.993,The thief...
01:12:09.993,01:12:13.621,was running towards me.
01:12:13.621,01:12:16.916,"I could've stopped him, but I wanted..."
01:12:16.916,01:12:20.544,revenge.
01:12:20.544,01:12:24.215,So I let him go.
01:12:24.215,01:12:27.802,I let him get away.
01:12:32.807,01:12:34.725,He wanted a car.
01:12:34.725,01:12:38.229,He tried to take Uncle Ben's.
01:12:38.229,01:12:40.064,Uncle Ben...
01:12:40.064,01:12:41.649,said no.
01:12:43.026,01:12:44.360,And then he shot him.
01:12:48.614,01:12:50.533,Uncle Ben...
01:12:50.533,01:12:53.744,was killed that night...
01:12:53.744,01:12:57.581,for being the only one who did the right thing.
01:13:00.293,01:13:02.003,And I...
01:13:05.298,01:13:08.051,I held his hand...
01:13:08.051,01:13:10.178,when he died.
01:13:16.642,01:13:20.521,I've tried to tell you so many times.
01:14:16.286,01:14:18.621,Just one more little chore.
01:14:25.878,01:14:27.922,Where are you?
01:14:29.506,01:14:32.343,"I'm leaving for the night, sir."
01:14:32.343,01:14:33.636,Fine.
01:14:33.636,01:14:36.306,Your father only obsessed over his work.
01:14:36.306,01:14:38.557,"Good night, Bernard."
01:15:25.896,01:15:27.648,Ah!
01:15:31.652,01:15:32.945,"Hello, Harry."
01:15:32.945,01:15:34.197,Otto.
01:15:34.197,01:15:35.990,What do you want?
01:15:35.990,01:15:38.575,That precious tritium.
01:15:38.575,01:15:40.036,But I need more of it this time.
01:15:41.787,01:15:43.498,More tritium?
01:15:43.498,01:15:44.999,You'll destroy the city!
01:15:44.999,01:15:46.334,You're a hack!
01:15:47.126,01:15:49.128,"Hey, hey, hey."
01:15:49.128,01:15:51.755,Hey. Hey! Hey!
01:15:51.755,01:15:53.049,Stop! Stop!
01:15:53.049,01:15:55.301,All right! Ah!
01:15:55.301,01:15:56.844,"All right, all right, all right."
01:15:56.844,01:15:59.180,"All right, put me down."
01:16:01.391,01:16:02.683,Okay.
01:16:09.065,01:16:10.691,Kill Spider-Man...
01:16:10.691,01:16:12.360,I'll give you all the tritium you need.
01:16:12.360,01:16:16.989,"On second thought, bring him to me...alive."
01:16:16.989,01:16:18.366,How do I find him?
01:16:19.492,01:16:20.868,Peter Parker.
01:16:20.868,01:16:22.286,Parker?
01:16:20.868,01:16:23.829,He takes pictures of Spider-Man for the Bugle.
01:16:23.829,01:16:25.415,Make him tell you where he is.
01:16:30.878,01:16:32.463,Have it ready.
01:16:36.259,01:16:37.385,Don't hurt Peter!
01:16:48.396,01:16:49.730,"WOMAN: Auxilio, fuego!"
01:16:50.981,01:16:53.817,"Somebody, help!"
01:16:53.817,01:16:56.195,WOMAN: Fire!
01:16:56.195,01:16:58.573,Help! My baby's still in there!
01:16:58.573,01:17:00.366,Fuego!
01:17:03.786,01:17:05.121,"Alisa, Alisa!"
01:17:05.121,01:17:06.247,The Chens can't find their daughter.
01:17:06.247,01:17:08.541,H-have you seen her?
01:17:08.541,01:17:10.126,MAN: Somebody call the fire department!
01:17:10.126,01:17:11.710,Help!
01:17:11.710,01:17:12.795,Help!
01:17:12.795,01:17:14.589,Is anybody in that building?
01:17:14.589,01:17:17.216,"Yeah, we think there's a kid stuck on the second floor."
01:17:17.216,01:17:18.675,"Hey, where you going?!"
01:17:40.030,01:17:41.532,I'm coming!
01:17:44.952,01:17:46.996,Oh!
01:17:51.083,01:17:52.418,Ah!
01:17:55.421,01:17:57.089,Hah!
01:18:06.015,01:18:08.184,It's okay. It's okay.
01:18:08.184,01:18:10.394,I'm gonna get you out of here. Come on.
01:18:10.394,01:18:11.354,Come on.
01:19:11.914,01:19:12.998,Mama.
01:19:25.886,01:19:27.597,"You got some guts, kid."
01:19:27.597,01:19:30.391,Some poor soul got trapped on the fourth floor.
01:19:30.391,01:19:32.685,Never made it out.
01:19:32.685,01:19:33.769,Aw...
01:19:36.313,01:19:39.483,"All right, Billy, let's knock it down and roll them up."
01:19:39.483,01:19:41.527,Get on out of here.
01:19:41.527,01:19:42.986,"Let's get all this equipment, let's go!"
01:19:42.986,01:19:44.447,Let's move it!
01:19:49.619,01:19:53.872,Am I not supposed to have what I want?
01:19:53.872,01:19:56.083,What I need?
01:19:57.918,01:20:01.046,What am I supposed to do?
01:20:04.467,01:20:05.801,"Oh, uh..."
01:20:07.136,01:20:08.721,I s-shouldn't have without...
01:20:08.721,01:20:10.389,knocking.
01:20:14.769,01:20:16.687,Come in.
01:20:19.649,01:20:20.899,Hi.
01:20:20.899,01:20:22.610,Hi.
01:20:23.360,01:20:25.780,Um...
01:20:25.780,01:20:28.532,w-would you like a piece of chocolate cake?
01:20:30.367,01:20:31.702,Okay.
01:20:33.287,01:20:35.414,And a-a glass of milk?
01:20:38.208,01:20:40.294,That would be nice.
01:20:41.545,01:20:42.879,Okay.
01:20:49.595,01:20:51.555,Mmm.
01:21:04.151,01:21:06.278,Thank you.
01:21:08.489,01:21:10.741,"Oh, um..."
01:21:10.741,01:21:12.451,you got a message.
01:21:13.410,01:21:14.995,It's your aunt.
01:21:14.995,01:21:15.954,Thanks.
01:21:15.954,01:21:17.289,Mm-hmm.
01:21:33.013,01:21:34.181,What's going on?
01:21:34.181,01:21:38.060,"Oh, they gave me another few weeks, but I decided the hell with it."
01:21:38.060,01:21:39.854,I'm moving on.
01:21:39.854,01:21:42.272,I found a small apartment.
01:21:42.272,01:21:43.733,Why didn't you tell me?
01:21:43.733,01:21:47.361,I'm quite able to take care of things myself.
01:21:47.361,01:21:50.364,And Henry Jackson across the street is giving me a hand.
01:21:50.364,01:21:52.032,And I'm giving him five dollars.
01:21:52.032,01:21:53.033,That's Henry Jackson?
01:21:53.033,01:21:54.785,Yes.
01:21:54.785,01:21:56.995,It's funny what happens in two years.
01:21:56.995,01:22:01.208,"Nine years old, has great ambitions."
01:22:01.208,01:22:04.211,"Um...listen, about..."
01:22:04.211,01:22:05.588,my last visit...
01:22:05.588,01:22:07.964,"Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it."
01:22:07.964,01:22:12.595,"It's water over the dam or under the bridge or wherever you like it, but..."
01:22:16.223,01:22:20.310,But you made a brave move in telling me the truth.
01:22:20.310,01:22:22.104,And I'm proud of you.
01:22:23.272,01:22:26.149,"And I thank you, and I..."
01:22:26.901,01:22:29.779,"I love you, Peter."
01:22:29.779,01:22:33.699,"So very, very much."
01:22:52.468,01:22:54.595,"Hey, where are all my comic books?"
01:22:54.595,01:22:55.596,Oh!
01:22:55.596,01:22:57.097,Those dreadful things?
01:22:57.097,01:22:58.641,I gave those away.
01:23:01.351,01:23:03.228,"HENRY: I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker."
01:23:03.228,01:23:04.772,"Thank you, Henry."
01:23:04.772,01:23:05.815,"Hi, Peter."
01:23:05.815,01:23:06.816,"Hey, Henry."
01:23:06.816,01:23:08.191,You're getting tall.
01:23:08.191,01:23:12.279,"Henry, why don't you put those cookbooks in with the mixer?"
01:23:12.279,01:23:13.781,Okay.
01:23:13.781,01:23:15.783,"You take Spider-Man's pictures, right?"
01:23:15.783,01:23:17.993,PETER: I used to.
01:23:17.993,01:23:19.244,HENRY: Where is he?
01:23:19.244,01:23:20.996,Henry and I agree.
01:23:20.996,01:23:23.666,We don't see his picture in the paper anymore.
01:23:25.501,01:23:27.043,He...
01:23:27.043,01:23:28.587,uh...
01:23:29.254,01:23:30.213,quit.
01:23:30.213,01:23:31.715,Why?
01:23:32.675,01:23:34.259,Wanted to try other things.
01:23:34.259,01:23:36.428,"He'll be back, right?"
01:23:37.596,01:23:39.348,I don't know.
01:23:40.641,01:23:43.519,You'll never guess who he wants to be.
01:23:43.519,01:23:45.354,Spider-Man.
01:23:45.354,01:23:46.647,Why?
01:23:46.647,01:23:49.692,"Well, he knows a hero when he sees one."
01:23:49.692,01:23:55.656,"Too few characters out there, flying around like that, saving old girls like me."
01:23:55.656,01:23:59.576,And Lord knows kids like Henry need a hero.
01:23:59.576,01:24:05.624,"Courageous, self-sacrificing people setting examples for all of us."
01:24:05.624,01:24:08.126,Everybody loves a hero.
01:24:08.126,01:24:11.714,"People line up for them, cheer them, scream their names."
01:24:11.714,01:24:22.599,"And years later, they'll tell how they stood in the rain for hours, just to get a glimpse of the one who taught them to hold on a second longer."
01:24:22.599,01:24:27.021,I believe there's a hero in all of us...
01:24:27.021,01:24:29.439,that keeps us honest...
01:24:29.439,01:24:31.107,gives us strength...
01:24:31.107,01:24:34.528,makes us noble...
01:24:34.528,01:24:39.115,"and, finally, allows us to die with pride."
01:24:39.115,01:24:46.498,Even though sometimes we have to be steady and-- And give up the thing we want the most.
01:24:48.042,01:24:49.752,Even our dreams.
01:24:51.545,01:24:54.506,"Spider-Man did that for Henry, and..."
01:24:54.506,01:24:58.052,he wonders where he's gone.
01:24:58.052,01:25:00.136,He needs him.
01:25:04.641,01:25:06.226,Do you think you could...
01:25:06.226,01:25:09.855,lift that desk and put it into the garage for me?
01:25:09.855,01:25:12.232,But don't strain yourself.
01:25:12.232,01:25:14.234,Okay.
01:25:32.419,01:25:35.005,Strong focus on what I want.
01:26:01.824,01:26:04.493,Whooooo-hoo!
01:26:04.493,01:26:06.453,I'm back!
01:26:06.453,01:26:07.830,I'm baaaack!
01:26:25.305,01:26:26.682,My back.
01:26:27.683,01:26:29.392,Oh! My back!
01:26:52.958,01:26:58.130,"JOHN: Honey, you sure you don't wanna invite your friend, the photographer?"
01:26:58.130,01:26:59.589,Peter Parker?
01:27:00.090,01:27:01.717,Oh...
01:27:01.717,01:27:03.343,Positive.
01:27:03.343,01:27:04.302,Thought he was your pal.
01:27:04.302,01:27:05.929,Peter Parker?
01:27:05.929,01:27:07.347,Yeah.
01:27:07.347,01:27:10.559,"Uh, he's just a great big jerk."
01:27:10.559,01:27:12.644,"Well, the world's full of great big jerks."
01:27:14.104,01:27:16.439,You're adorable.
01:27:16.439,01:27:19.026,It's just the uniform.
01:27:21.444,01:27:23.279,Lean your head back for me.
01:27:23.279,01:27:24.698,Put my head back?
01:27:24.698,01:27:26.200,Yeah. Just do it.
01:27:28.077,01:27:29.161,Just put my head back?
01:27:29.161,01:27:30.620,Mm-hmm.
01:27:30.620,01:27:32.247,Okay.
01:27:51.225,01:27:52.601,Wow.
01:27:53.435,01:27:55.687,I'm back on the moon.
01:27:59.900,01:28:01.610,You up there with me?
01:28:22.214,01:28:23.381,Hiya.
01:28:23.381,01:28:24.382,Surprised?
01:28:24.382,01:28:26.426,Very.
01:28:26.426,01:28:28.220,Thanks for coming.
01:28:28.220,01:28:29.387,Everything okay?
01:28:29.387,01:28:31.181,Uh...
01:28:31.181,01:28:33.183,You might say so.
01:28:34.184,01:28:35.310,This is funny.
01:28:35.310,01:28:38.272,I'm not sure how to begin.
01:28:40.065,01:28:42.901,You know how our minds play tricks on us.
01:28:42.901,01:28:44.194,Tell me about it.
01:28:44.194,01:28:47.739,"Well, mine did a real number on me."
01:28:47.739,01:28:56.206,"Some part of me heard what you had to say after the show that night, that you were different, but I didn't wanna listen."
01:28:56.206,01:29:00.627,I was afraid to trust you.
01:29:00.627,01:29:02.420,But...
01:29:02.420,01:29:05.174,I've been thinking about it-- Listen...
01:29:05.174,01:29:08.635,there's more for me to say.
01:29:10.553,01:29:12.222,I...
01:29:12.222,01:29:14.474,maybe rushed into things.
01:29:14.474,01:29:16.559,I thought-- Wait a minute.
01:29:16.559,01:29:18.728,What are you saying?
01:29:18.728,01:29:21.106,I'm saying...
01:29:21.106,01:29:23.650,I...
01:29:23.650,01:29:25.235,uh...
01:29:26.945,01:29:30.324,"I thought I could be there for you, Mary Jane."
01:29:30.324,01:29:32.408,But I can't.
01:29:35.287,01:29:38.540,My mind was playing tricks too.
01:29:43.170,01:29:44.754,Do you love me...
01:29:44.754,01:29:46.464,or not?
01:29:52.762,01:29:55.182,I...
01:29:57.809,01:29:59.602,don't.
01:30:03.773,01:30:05.108,You don't.
01:30:15.369,01:30:16.828,Kiss me.
01:30:18.288,01:30:20.290,Kiss you?
01:30:20.290,01:30:22.458,I need to know something.
01:30:25.045,01:30:26.838,Just one kiss.
01:31:13.802,01:31:15.095,What's happening?
01:31:26.064,01:31:28.608,Peter Parker.
01:31:28.608,01:31:30.526,And the girlfriend.
01:31:30.526,01:31:31.987,What do you want?
01:31:35.489,01:31:37.617,"I want you to find your friend, Spider-Man."
01:31:37.617,01:31:40.370,Tell him to meet me at the Westside Tower at 3:00.
01:31:40.370,01:31:41.788,I don't know where he is.
01:31:44.166,01:31:45.875,Find him.
01:31:48.003,01:31:51.047,Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.
01:31:51.047,01:31:55.218,If you lay one finger on her-- You'll do what?
01:33:08.750,01:33:12.254,Still no word on the whereabouts of your son's fiancée.
01:33:12.254,01:33:15.090,"Sorry, Jonah."
01:33:15.090,01:33:18.343,It's all my fault.
01:33:18.343,01:33:21.137,I drove Spider-Man away.
01:33:21.137,01:33:25.559,HOFFMAN: He was the only one who could've stopped Octavius.
01:33:25.559,01:33:26.893,Yes.
01:33:28.270,01:33:30.188,Spider-Man...
01:33:30.188,01:33:32.815,was a hero.
01:33:32.815,01:33:34.859,I just couldn't see it.
01:33:36.486,01:33:38.654,He was a-- A thief!
01:33:38.654,01:33:40.865,A criminal!
01:33:40.865,01:33:42.909,He stole my suit!
01:33:42.909,01:33:44.786,He's a menace to the entire city!
01:33:44.786,01:33:47.830,I want that wall-crawling arachnid prosecuted!
01:33:47.830,01:33:50.083,I want him strung up by his web!
01:33:51.293,01:33:54.837,I want Spider-Maaaaaan!
01:33:59.509,01:34:00.802,Hah!
01:34:22.616,01:34:24.117,Where is she?
01:34:24.117,01:34:25.785,"Oh, she'll be just fine."
01:34:25.785,01:34:26.911,Let's talk.
01:34:53.229,01:34:54.564,Ah!
01:35:02.989,01:35:04.324,Oomph.
01:35:18.046,01:35:19.381,What the hell?!
01:37:10.742,01:37:12.076,Hm.
01:37:24.339,01:37:25.715,You have a train to catch.
01:37:28.968,01:37:30.844,MAN: Help!
01:37:30.844,01:37:33.097,Help! Help!
01:37:33.097,01:37:35.642,I can't stop it!
01:37:53.785,01:37:54.910,It's Spider-Man!
01:37:54.910,01:37:56.788,"Oh, my God!"
01:37:56.788,01:37:58.164,Tell everyone to hang on!
01:37:58.164,01:38:00.333,Brace yourselves!
01:38:21.062,01:38:23.857,Any more bright ideas?
01:38:23.857,01:38:25.149,I got a few.
01:38:25.149,01:38:26.442,Yeah!
01:38:43.793,01:38:44.918,Ahhhhh!
01:38:47.672,01:38:49.173,Better watch out!
01:39:20.371,01:39:21.539,We're slowing down.
01:40:25.603,01:40:28.857,"MAN: Nice and easy, we'll go down."
01:40:28.857,01:40:30.650,"MAN 2: Slower, gently."
01:40:34.946,01:40:36.531,Is he alive?
01:40:40.535,01:40:41.911,He's...
01:40:41.911,01:40:43.705,just a kid.
01:40:44.914,01:40:46.582,No older than my son.
01:41:06.268,01:41:07.729,It's all right.
01:41:12.191,01:41:13.693,We found something.
01:41:23.411,01:41:25.496,We won't tell nobody.
01:41:38.927,01:41:41.763,"It's good to have you back, Spider-Man."
01:41:58.487,01:41:59.530,Hyah!
01:42:01.574,01:42:02.867,He's mine!
01:42:04.452,01:42:07.080,"You wanna get to him, you gotta go through me."
01:42:07.080,01:42:09.164,And me.
01:42:09.164,01:42:10.792,Me too.
01:42:15.296,01:42:16.255,Very well.
01:42:46.119,01:42:47.202,Where do you want him?
01:42:56.045,01:42:58.006,And the tritium?
01:43:11.560,01:43:13.813,Yes.
01:43:43.718,01:43:46.679,If only I could cause you the pain that you've caused me.
01:43:49.390,01:43:51.976,"First, we'll see who's behind the mask."
01:43:51.976,01:43:53.728,I can look into your eyes as you die.
01:43:57.106,01:43:58.816,Pete...
01:43:58.816,01:44:00.109,No...
01:44:00.818,01:44:02.111,It can't be.
01:44:09.368,01:44:12.163,Harry...
01:44:12.163,01:44:14.207,where is she?
01:44:14.207,01:44:16.667,Where is he keeping her?
01:44:16.667,01:44:18.293,He's got M.J.
01:44:18.293,01:44:20.963,"No, a-a-all he wanted was the tritium."
01:44:20.963,01:44:22.590,Tritium?
01:44:24.884,01:44:27.636,He's making the machine again.
01:44:27.636,01:44:32.100,"When that happens, she'll die along with half of New York."
01:44:32.100,01:44:33.350,"Now, where is he?"
01:44:33.350,01:44:36.311,Peter...
01:44:36.311,01:44:38.773,you killed my father.
01:44:42.985,01:44:46.572,There are bigger things happening here than me and you.
01:44:47.656,01:44:51.035,"Harry, please, I've got to stop him."
01:45:01.212,01:45:04.215,MARY JANE: Hey!
01:45:04.215,01:45:05.883,Hey!
01:45:07.176,01:45:09.178,I'm talking to you!
01:45:09.178,01:45:12.848,"You got what you needed for your little science project, now let me go."
01:45:12.848,01:45:15.184,I can't let you go.
01:45:15.184,01:45:17.603,"Not that anybody could stop me, now that Spider-Man's dead."
01:45:17.603,01:45:19.897,He's not dead.
01:45:19.897,01:45:20.982,I don't believe you.
01:45:20.982,01:45:22.191,Believe it.
01:45:39.959,01:45:41.043,Surprise.
01:45:46.174,01:45:53.973,As soon as you get free-- I should have known Osborn wouldn't have the spine to finish you!
01:45:53.973,01:45:55.516,"Shut it down, Ock."
01:45:55.516,01:45:57.434,You're gonna hurt a lot more people this time.
01:45:57.434,01:46:00.021,"Well, that's a risk we're willing to take."
01:46:00.980,01:46:02.064,"Well, I'm not."
01:46:35.388,01:46:36.724,"Hang on, Mary Jane!"
01:46:52.614,01:46:54.033,Run!
01:47:18.557,01:47:19.975,Let's see you scurry out of this.
01:47:23.229,01:47:24.605,Yaargh!
01:47:44.499,01:47:45.834,Now what?
01:48:16.865,01:48:18.200,Dr. Octavius.
01:48:22.455,01:48:24.290,We have to shut it down.
01:48:24.290,01:48:26.083,Please tell me how.
01:48:26.083,01:48:27.418,Peter Parker.
01:48:31.297,01:48:33.506,Brilliant but lazy.
01:48:33.506,01:48:34.967,Look at what's happening.
01:48:35.926,01:48:38.179,We must destroy it.
01:48:43.434,01:48:45.478,I can't destroy it.
01:48:50.149,01:48:51.192,I won't.
01:48:57.281,01:48:59.574,You once spoke to me about intelligence.
01:49:01.618,01:49:05.122,That it was a gift to be used for the good of mankind.
01:49:06.457,01:49:08.792,A privilege.
01:49:08.792,01:49:12.963,These things have turned you into something you're not.
01:49:12.963,01:49:14.256,Don't listen to them.
01:49:20.553,01:49:22.264,It was my dream.
01:49:22.264,01:49:23.598,Sometimes...
01:49:23.598,01:49:29.562,"to do what's right, we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most."
01:49:29.562,01:49:31.564,Even our dreams.
01:49:37.821,01:49:39.240,You're right.
01:49:47.164,01:49:48.249,He's right.
01:49:50.709,01:49:51.793,Listen...
01:49:54.255,01:49:56.840,Listen...to me now.
01:49:59.385,01:50:01.887,Listen to me now!
01:50:05.640,01:50:06.641,Now...
01:50:06.641,01:50:08.519,tell me how to stop it.
01:50:09.686,01:50:11.480,It can't be stopped.
01:50:12.856,01:50:14.942,It's self-sustaining now.
01:50:14.942,01:50:15.984,Think!
01:50:15.984,01:50:17.152,Unless...
01:50:18.737,01:50:20.613,The river.
01:50:21.907,01:50:23.492,Drown it.
01:50:25.244,01:50:26.619,I'll do it.
01:51:11.957,01:51:13.083,Noooooo!
01:51:26.555,01:51:27.889,Hi.
01:51:28.890,01:51:30.225,Hi.
01:51:31.393,01:51:33.103,This is really heavy.
01:51:57.294,01:51:58.587,M.J...
01:52:00.214,01:52:02.174,in case we die...
01:52:02.174,01:52:03.925,You do love me.
01:52:03.925,01:52:05.636,I do.
01:52:05.636,01:52:08.763,Even though you said you didn't.
01:52:11.350,01:52:14.520,I will not die a monster.
01:53:19.209,01:53:22.463,I think I always knew...
01:53:22.463,01:53:25.215,all this time...
01:53:25.215,01:53:27.217,who you really were.
01:53:27.217,01:53:31.388,Then you know why we can't be together.
01:53:31.388,01:53:34.600,Spider-Man will always have enemies.
01:53:36.310,01:53:38.687,I can't let you take that risk.
01:53:43.816,01:53:45.360,I will...
01:53:46.903,01:53:49.615,always be Spider-Man.
01:53:51.784,01:53:54.369,You and I can never be.
01:54:42.543,01:54:44.252,JOHN: Mary Jane!
01:55:47.608,01:55:48.692,Hello?
01:56:05.208,01:56:06.501,Who's that?
01:56:06.501,01:56:07.920,OSBORN: Son.
01:56:10.046,01:56:11.548,I'm here.
01:56:12.549,01:56:14.843,Dad?
01:56:14.843,01:56:18.012,I thought you were-- No.
01:56:18.012,01:56:20.181,"I'm alive in you, Harry."
01:56:20.181,01:56:21.516,Now it's your turn.
01:56:23.101,01:56:26.020,You swore to make Spider-Man pay.
01:56:26.020,01:56:28.064,Now make him pay.
01:56:28.064,01:56:29.900,But Pete's my best friend.
01:56:29.900,01:56:31.401,And I'm your father.
01:56:32.402,01:56:33.779,You're weak.
01:56:34.905,01:56:36.364,You were always weak.
01:56:36.364,01:56:39.242,You'll always be weak until you take control.
01:56:40.410,01:56:44.038,Now you know the truth about Peter.
01:56:44.038,01:56:46.458,"Be strong, Harry."
01:56:46.458,01:56:48.543,Avenge me.
01:56:50.796,01:56:51.839,Avenge me!
01:56:51.839,01:56:53.131,No!
01:57:00.889,01:57:02.307,Wha...?
01:59:17.734,01:59:19.444,Call Deborah.
01:59:19.444,01:59:22.196,The--? The caterer?
01:59:22.196,01:59:24.282,Tell her not to open the caviar.
02:00:05.657,02:00:09.161,Had to do what I had to do.
02:00:09.161,02:00:11.038,Mary Jane.
02:00:11.955,02:00:13.915,Peter.
02:00:13.915,02:00:17.002,I can't survive without you.
02:00:27.012,02:00:30.015,You shouldn't be here.
02:00:30.015,02:00:38.690,"I know you think we can't be together, but can't you respect me enough to let me make my own decision?"
02:00:38.690,02:00:45.197,"I know there'll be risks, but I want to face them with you."
02:00:45.197,02:00:48.616,It's wrong that we should only be half alive...
02:00:48.616,02:00:51.536,half of ourselves.
02:00:52.871,02:00:54.789,I love you.
02:00:56.791,02:01:01.504,"So here I am, standing in your doorway."
02:01:01.504,02:01:04.132,I've always been standing in your doorway.
02:01:11.890,02:01:15.560,Isn't it about time somebody saved your life?
02:01:20.899,02:01:23.235,"Well, say something."
02:01:25.361,02:01:28.406,"Thank you, Mary Jane Watson."
02:01:44.256,02:01:46.174,"Go get them, tiger."
02:02:08.362,02:02:09.697,Whoo!
02:02:10.448,02:02:11.783,Hoo-hoo!
