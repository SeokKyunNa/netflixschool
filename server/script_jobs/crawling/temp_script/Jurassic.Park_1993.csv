00:01:25.417,00:01:28.166,"Everybody, heads up!"
00:01:28.208,00:01:31.583,Keep it clear!
00:01:31.625,00:01:35.375,"¡Andale, si! Vamonos."
00:01:35.417,00:01:38.208,Mark it down!
00:01:42.917,00:01:45.792,"That's good, stay!"
00:01:45.834,00:01:49.125,¡No lo vayan a tirar!
00:01:49.166,00:01:50.792,"¡Traigala, traigala!"
00:01:56.792,00:01:59.083,"Okay, pushing team, move in there."
00:01:59.125,00:02:03.917,"¡Cuidado, vamos!"
00:02:03.959,00:02:06.291,Aaah!
00:02:06.333,00:02:07.542,Steady!
00:02:07.583,00:02:11.417,Move it!
00:02:11.458,00:02:12.458,And push!
00:02:20.208,00:02:23.125,We're locked.
00:02:23.166,00:02:24.583,Gatekeeper!
00:02:30.375,00:02:33.125,"Jophery, raise the gate."
00:02:45.125,00:02:46.500,Aaah!
00:02:47.542,00:02:49.917,Aaah!
00:02:49.959,00:02:52.083,Block the opening!
00:02:59.291,00:03:00.583,Aaah!
00:03:00.625,00:03:04.250,Somebody help him!
00:03:04.291,00:03:06.458,Work her back!
00:03:13.125,00:03:15.375,Don't let me go!
00:03:15.417,00:03:17.250,Help!
00:03:17.291,00:03:18.792,Shoot her!
00:03:20.500,00:03:23.166,- Shoot her!
00:03:49.041,00:03:50.709,Apuesto mil pesos que se cae.
00:03:52.959,00:03:57.000,"Hola, Juanito."
00:03:57.041,00:03:58.291,What's this I hear at the airport?
00:03:58.333,00:04:00.709,Hammond's not even here?
00:04:00.750,00:04:06.625,"We are facing a $20-million lawsuit by the family of that worker, and you're telling me that Hammond can't even be bothered to see me?"
00:04:06.667,00:04:09.500,He had to leave early to be with his daughter.
00:04:09.542,00:04:12.709,"I understand that, but we've been advised to deal with the situation now."
00:04:12.750,00:04:14.959,The insurance company-- You okay?
00:04:17.083,00:04:19.291,The underwriters feel that the accident has raised...
00:04:19.333,00:04:22.500,some very serious safety questions about the park.
00:04:22.542,00:04:25.125,"That makes the investors very, very anxious."
00:04:25.166,00:04:28.000,I had to promise to conduct a very thorough on-site inspection.
00:04:29.959,00:04:32.417,Hammond hates inspections.
00:04:32.458,00:04:35.041,"Juanito, they'll pull the funding."
00:04:35.083,00:04:37.250,That'll slow him down more.
00:04:37.291,00:04:39.542,¿Seguro?
00:04:41.458,00:04:44.000,Ooh! Aaah!
00:04:44.041,00:04:49.250,"If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys will back off."
00:04:49.291,00:04:52.291,"I've already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy."
00:04:52.333,00:04:56.000,They want Alan Grant.
00:04:56.041,00:04:57.542,"¡Luz, mas luz!"
00:04:57.583,00:04:59.875,"¡Muchachos, echenme luz!"
00:04:59.917,00:05:01.667,Why not?
00:05:03.458,00:05:06.583,Because Grant's like me.
00:05:07.333,00:05:09.083,He's a digger.
00:05:12.458,00:05:14.792,Que lindo eres.
00:05:14.834,00:05:57.917,"Vas a ser-- Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler, we're ready to try again."
00:05:57.959,00:06:01.834,I hate computers.
00:06:13.417,00:06:15.208,You'll get a reading from that.
00:06:16.291,00:06:19.375,Take a look.
00:06:19.417,00:06:21.542,Did it work?
00:06:21.583,00:06:23.417,How long does this usually take?
00:06:23.458,00:06:25.250,It should bring an immediate return.
00:06:25.291,00:06:28.709,"You shoot the radar into the ground, and the bone bounces the image back."
00:06:28.750,00:06:31.208,Bounces it back.
00:06:31.250,00:06:35.750,This new program's incredible.
00:06:35.792,00:06:39.542,"A few more years' development, and we won't even have to dig anymore."
00:06:39.583,00:06:41.959,Where's the fun in that?
00:06:42.000,00:06:45.166,"It's a little distorted, but I don't think it's the computer."
00:06:45.208,00:06:49.917,Hmm. Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.
00:06:49.959,00:06:53.500,- Velociraptor?
00:06:53.542,00:06:56.750,"It's five, six feet high."
00:06:53.542,00:06:59.125,Look at the extraordinary-- What'd you do?
00:06:59.166,00:07:01.458,Dr. Grant's not machine compatible.
00:07:01.500,00:07:04.166,"Hell, they've got it in for me."
00:07:04.208,00:07:06.750,And look at the half-moon shaped bones in the wrists.
00:07:06.792,00:07:10.000,It's no wonder these guys learned how to fly.
00:07:10.041,00:07:14.625,"No, seriously."
00:07:14.667,00:07:17.917,"Well, maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present-day birds..."
00:07:17.959,00:07:20.000,than they do with reptiles.
00:07:20.041,00:07:23.291,"Look at the pubic bone, turned backward, just like a bird."
00:07:23.333,00:07:27.458,"Look at the vertebrae, full of air sacs and hollows, just like a bird."
00:07:27.500,00:07:30.625,And even the word raptor means bird of prey.
00:07:30.667,00:07:33.500,That doesn't look very scary.
00:07:33.542,00:07:35.959,That kid's a pistol.
00:07:36.000,00:07:39.625,More like a six-foot turkey.
00:07:39.667,00:07:42.500,"A turkey, huh?"
00:07:42.542,00:07:44.583,Okay.
00:07:44.625,00:07:47.417,Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous Period.
00:07:47.458,00:07:51.792,You get your first look at this six-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.
00:07:51.834,00:07:55.792,"He moves like a bird, lightly bobbing his head."
00:07:55.834,00:07:58.667,And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity...
00:07:58.709,00:08:02.208,"is based on movement, like T. rex, and he'll lose you if you don't move."
00:08:02.250,00:08:05.166,"But no, not Velociraptor."
00:08:05.208,00:08:09.834,"You stare at him, and he just stares right back."
00:08:09.875,00:08:11.458,And that's when the attack comes.
00:08:11.500,00:08:14.959,"Not from the front, but from the side."
00:08:15.000,00:08:20.000,From the other two raptors you didn't even know were there.
00:08:20.041,00:08:22.208,"Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter, you see."
00:08:22.250,00:08:28.291,"He uses coordinated attack patterns, and he is out in force today."
00:08:28.333,00:08:35.750,"And he slashes at you with this, a six-inch retractable claw, like a razor, on the middle toe."
00:08:35.792,00:08:38.709,"He doesn't bother to bite your jugular like a lion, say."
00:08:38.750,00:08:44.208,"No, no. He slashes at you here or here."
00:08:44.250,00:08:46.417,"Oh, Alan."
00:08:46.458,00:08:51.375,"Or maybe across the belly, spilling your intestines."
00:08:51.417,00:08:56.333,"The point is, you are alive when they start to eat you."
00:08:57.875,00:09:02.959,"So you know, try to show a little respect."
00:09:11.250,00:09:15.792,"Hey, Alan, if you wanted to scare the kid, you could have pulled a gun on him, you know."
00:09:15.834,00:09:19.250,"Yeah, I know."
00:09:19.291,00:09:22.750,You want to have one of those?
00:09:22.792,00:09:26.959,"But a breed of a child, Dr. Grant, could be intriguing."
00:09:27.000,00:09:30.250,"I mean, what's so wrong with kids?"
00:09:30.291,00:09:34.792,"They're noisy, they're messy, they're expensive."
00:09:34.834,00:09:37.166,They smell.
00:09:37.208,00:09:38.875,Some of them smell.
00:09:38.917,00:09:40.500,Babies smell.
00:09:48.000,00:09:50.417,Cover the site!
00:09:50.458,00:09:52.834,Tell them to shut down!
00:09:52.875,00:09:55.709,Cover it all up!
00:09:57.208,00:09:58.709,"Just cut it, will ya?"
00:09:58.750,00:10:01.417,Cut it out!
00:10:01.458,00:10:03.792,What?
00:10:17.500,00:10:19.500,What the hell do you think you're doing in here?
00:10:19.542,00:10:23.625,"Hey, we were saving that."
00:10:23.667,00:10:26.083,For today.
00:10:27.667,00:10:30.667,Who in God's name do you think you are?
00:10:27.667,00:10:34.834,"John Hammond, and I'm delighted to meet you finally in person, Dr. Grant."
00:10:34.875,00:10:40.917,"Mr. Hammond-- Well, I can see that my, uh, 50,000 a year has been well spent."
00:10:40.959,00:10:42.125,"Okay, who's the jerk?"
00:10:42.166,00:10:45.375,"Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr.-- Sattler."
00:10:45.417,00:10:48.125,Aha!
00:10:48.166,00:10:53.792,"I'm sorry about our dramatic entrance, Dr. Sattler, but we're in a wee bit of a hurry."
00:10:53.834,00:10:57.166,Will you have a drink?
00:10:57.208,00:10:59.542,"Here, let me-- I'll just get a glass or two."
00:10:59.583,00:11:01.709,"No, no, no, no."
00:11:01.750,00:11:03.917,I know my way around the kitchen.
00:11:03.959,00:11:06.333,"Now, I'll get right to the point."
00:11:06.375,00:11:10.500,"Um, I like ya, both of ya."
00:11:10.542,00:11:13.041,I can tell instantly about people.
00:11:13.083,00:11:15.125,It's a gift.
00:11:17.000,00:11:20.625,I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica.
00:11:20.667,00:11:26.792,"I've leased it from the government, and I've spent the last five years setting up a kind of biological preserve."
00:11:26.834,00:11:29.417,Really spectacular.
00:11:29.458,00:11:32.834,Make the one I've got down in Kenya look like a petting zoo.
00:11:32.875,00:11:37.458,And there's no doubt our attractions will drive kids out of their minds.
00:11:37.500,00:11:40.542,And what are those?
00:11:40.583,00:11:43.959,"And not just kids, everyone."
00:11:44.000,00:11:46.000,"That is, if the lawyers don't kill me first."
00:11:46.041,00:11:49.000,I don't care for lawyers. Do you?
00:11:49.041,00:11:52.000,"Oh, we, uh, don't know any."
00:11:52.041,00:11:53.750,"Well, I do, I'm afraid."
00:11:53.792,00:11:57.291,There's a particular pebble in my shoe who represents my investors.
00:11:57.333,00:12:01.834,Says that they insist on outside opinions.
00:12:01.875,00:12:04.834,"Well, your kind, not to put too fine a point on it."
00:12:04.875,00:12:06.458,"I mean, let's face it."
00:12:06.500,00:12:09.667,"In your particular field, you're the top minds."
00:12:09.709,00:12:21.333,"And if I could just persuade you to sign off on the park, you know, give it your endorsement, maybe even pen a wee testimonial, I could get back on shedual, uh, schedule."
00:12:21.375,00:12:24.709,Why would they care what we think?
00:12:27.500,00:12:29.291,It's right up your alley.
00:12:31.875,00:12:33.375,I'll tell you what.
00:12:33.417,00:12:35.583,"Why don't you come down, just the pair of ya, for the weekend?"
00:12:35.625,00:12:39.208,I'd love to have an opinion of a paleobotanist as well.
00:12:39.250,00:12:43.375,I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.
00:12:43.417,00:12:46.625,"Look, I'm sorry."
00:12:43.417,00:12:48.333,"Yeah, we-- We just dug up a new skeleton."
00:12:48.375,00:12:52.917,I could compensate you by fully funding your dig.
00:12:52.959,00:12:55.500,And this is a very unusual time.
00:12:52.959,00:12:57.250,The timing is-- For a further three years.
00:12:57.291,00:12:59.333,Hmm?
00:12:59.375,00:13:03.917,"Well, uh-- where's the plane?"
00:13:06.208,00:13:08.208,"Yeah, okay."
00:13:08.250,00:13:12.458,Okay.
00:13:18.333,00:13:19.250,Gracias.
00:13:49.834,00:13:52.125,"Yo, Dodgson!"
00:14:00.166,00:14:02.834,You shouldn't use my name.
00:14:02.875,00:14:06.125,"Dodgson, Dodgson!"
00:14:06.166,00:14:09.875,See? Nobody cares.
00:14:09.917,00:14:12.000,"What are you tryin' to look like, a secret agent?"
00:14:13.166,00:14:15.625,Well?
00:14:15.667,00:14:18.083,"On delivery, 50,000 more for each viable embryo."
00:14:18.125,00:14:21.500,"That's 1.5 million, if you get all 15 species off the island."
00:14:21.542,00:14:23.959,"Oh, I'll get 'em all."
00:14:24.000,00:14:26.583,They're no use to us if they don't survive.
00:14:26.625,00:14:29.208,Oh! How am I supposed to transport them?
00:14:32.166,00:14:35.417,The bottom screws open.
00:14:35.458,00:14:37.792,That's great.
00:14:37.834,00:14:40.083,It's cooled and compartmentalized inside.
00:14:40.125,00:14:43.875,"Oh, that's great!"
00:14:43.917,00:14:46.250,Let me see.
00:14:46.291,00:14:49.083,There's enough coolant inside for 36 hours.
00:14:49.125,00:14:51.709,The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
00:14:51.750,00:14:54.083,That's up to your guy on the boat.
00:14:54.125,00:14:57.917,7:00 tomorrow night on the east dock.
00:14:57.959,00:14:59.500,How are you planning to beat security?
00:14:59.542,00:15:02.000,I've got an 18-minute window.
00:15:02.041,00:15:05.709,Eighteen minutes and your company catches up on ten years of research.
00:15:05.750,00:15:08.000,"Gracias, señor."
00:15:09.959,00:15:12.625,"Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson."
00:15:14.875,00:15:16.709,That was Hammond's mistake.
00:15:30.500,00:15:33.500,"So you two, um, dig up dinosaurs?"
00:15:35.750,00:15:38.875,Well-- We try to.
00:15:44.417,00:15:46.834,You'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm.
00:15:46.875,00:15:53.333,"He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician."
00:15:53.375,00:15:58.583,"John doesn't subscribe to chaos, particularly what it has to say about his science project."
00:15:58.625,00:16:01.333,You've never been able to sufficiently explain your concerns about the island.
00:16:01.375,00:16:04.709,"Oh, John, John."
00:16:04.750,00:16:07.542,"A load, if I may say so, of fashionable number crunching."
00:16:07.583,00:16:09.750,Is not.
00:16:09.792,00:16:12.500,"Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant, you've heard of chaos theory?"
00:16:12.542,00:16:16.208,No.
00:16:16.250,00:16:18.000,Strange attractors?
00:16:19.959,00:16:22.750,"Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you..."
00:16:22.792,00:16:25.417,aren't familiar with the concept of attraction.
00:16:27.959,00:16:32.375,Hmm! I bring scientists.
00:16:33.208,00:16:34.208,Hmm?
00:16:36.458,00:16:38.041,There it is.
00:17:05.250,00:17:06.291,Bad wind shears.
00:17:06.333,00:17:09.917,"We have to drop pretty fast, so hold on, because this can be just a little thrilling."
00:17:12.667,00:17:14.750,Ya-hoo!
00:17:37.208,00:17:43.458,"No, no, you need that piece over here, and that piece-- Look, we'll have landed by the time you get it right."
00:17:44.417,00:17:46.417,Wait.
00:19:04.041,00:19:06.500,The full 50 miles of perimeter fence are in place?
00:19:06.542,00:19:09.625,And the concrete moats and the motion sensor tracking systems.
00:19:09.667,00:19:13.625,"Donald, dear boy, relax."
00:19:13.667,00:19:14.750,"Let's get something straight, John."
00:19:14.792,00:19:16.583,This is not a weekend excursion.
00:19:16.625,00:19:19.709,This is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.
00:19:19.750,00:19:22.667,"Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned."
00:19:22.709,00:19:26.375,"Forty-eight hours from now, if they're not convinced, I'm not convinced."
00:19:26.417,00:19:28.583,"I'll shut you down, John."
00:19:28.625,00:19:32.667,"In 48 hours, I'll be accepting your apologies."
00:19:42.125,00:19:44.542,"All right, slow down, no closer."
00:19:46.542,00:19:48.375,This shouldn't be here.
00:20:07.875,00:20:11.834,"Alan, this species of veriforman's been extinct since the Cretaceous Period."
00:20:11.875,00:20:14.542,"I mean, this thing is humongous."
00:20:44.458,00:20:46.583,Look at that.
00:20:48.000,00:20:53.000,"Um, it's-- it's a dinosaur."
00:20:55.875,00:20:57.000,You did it.
00:20:57.041,00:21:00.250,"You crazy son of a bitch, you did."
00:21:00.291,00:21:03.208,"Oh, Ellie, we can just tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness."
00:21:03.250,00:21:05.333,It doesn't apply.
00:21:05.375,00:21:08.166,This is a warm-blooded creature.
00:21:08.208,00:21:11.458,"This thing's got what, a 25, 27-foot neck?"
00:21:11.500,00:21:12.500,"- The Brachiosaur, 30."
00:21:29.875,00:21:32.125,We're gonna make a fortune with this place.
00:21:36.959,00:21:38.375,How fast are they?
00:21:38.417,00:21:41.291,"Well, we clocked the T. rex at 32 miles an hour."
00:21:43.667,00:21:45.959,T-- T. rex?
00:21:46.000,00:21:48.834,You said you've got a T. rex?
00:21:48.875,00:21:51.208,Say again.
00:21:51.250,00:21:54.583,We have a T. rex.
00:21:54.625,00:21:57.583,Put your head between your knees.
00:21:57.625,00:22:04.917,"Dr. Grant, my dear Dr. Sattler, welcome to Jurassic Park."
00:22:28.083,00:22:30.667,They're moving in herds.
00:22:31.959,00:22:34.041,They do move in herds.
00:22:40.750,00:22:43.291,How'd you do this?
00:22:46.041,00:22:48.125,I'll show you.
00:23:11.959,00:23:13.375,"G'day, g'day, g'day!"
00:23:13.417,00:23:20.959,"Now, the most advanced amusement park in the entire world, incorporating all the latest technologies."
00:23:21.000,00:23:24.333,"And I'm not talking just about rides, you know."
00:23:24.375,00:23:28.875,"No, we've made living biological attractions so astounding..."
00:23:28.917,00:23:32.125,that they'll capture the imagination of the entire planet.
00:23:32.166,00:23:35.375,So what are you thinking?
00:23:35.417,00:23:36.583,That we're out of a job.
00:23:36.625,00:23:38.250,Don't you mean extinct?
00:23:46.667,00:23:48.667,"Well, now, why don't you all sit down?"
00:23:48.709,00:23:51.417,"Uh, Donald."
00:23:51.458,00:23:53.750,"Ah, here."
00:23:53.792,00:23:56.291,"Well, here I come."
00:23:59.166,00:24:02.917,"Hello, hello."
00:24:02.959,00:24:05.250,Hello.
00:24:05.291,00:24:09.208,"Hello, John."
00:24:09.250,00:24:12.458,"Well, fine, fine, I guess."
00:24:12.500,00:24:15.166,"Uh, uh, well, let me show you."
00:24:15.208,00:24:18.500,"First, I'll need a drop of blood, your blood."
00:24:18.542,00:24:21.125,Right.
00:24:21.166,00:24:23.709,"Ooh! John, that hurt."
00:24:23.750,00:24:27.250,"Relax, John, it's all part of the miracle of cloning."
00:24:27.291,00:24:30.000,"Hello, John."
00:24:30.041,00:24:32.500,Hello.
00:24:32.542,00:24:35.500,Loy extraction has never recreated an intact D.N.A. strand.
00:24:35.542,00:24:37.625,Not without massive sequence gaps.
00:24:37.667,00:24:40.000,Paleo-D.N.A.
00:24:40.041,00:24:42.417,Where do you get a 100-million-year-old dinosaur blood?
00:24:42.458,00:24:43.458,Shhh!
00:24:48.500,00:24:50.250,What?
00:24:50.291,00:24:54.667,"Oh, well, Mr. D.N.A."
00:24:54.709,00:24:57.000,Just one drop of your blood contains...
00:24:57.041,00:25:01.041,"billions of strands of D.N.A., the building blocks of life."
00:25:02.458,00:25:07.458,A D.N.A. strand like me is a blueprint for building a living thing.
00:25:07.500,00:25:15.709,"And sometimes, animals that went extinct millions of years ago, like dinosaurs, left their blueprints behind for us to find."
00:25:15.750,00:25:18.250,We just had to know where to look.
00:25:18.291,00:25:22.917,"100 million years ago, there were mosquitoes, just like today."
00:25:22.959,00:25:28.458,"And just like today, they fed on the blood of animals, even dinosaurs."
00:25:28.500,00:25:33.917,"Sometimes, after bitin' a dinosaur, the mosquito would land on the branch of a tree..."
00:25:33.959,00:25:36.083,and get stuck in the sap.
00:25:36.125,00:25:39.959,"After a long time, the tree sap would get hard..."
00:25:40.000,00:25:46.917,"and become fossilized, just like a dinosaur bone, preserving the mosquito inside."
00:25:46.959,00:25:55.417,"This fossilized tree sap, which we call amber, waited for millions of years with the mosquito inside..."
00:25:55.458,00:25:57.875,until Jurassic Park scientists came along.
00:25:57.917,00:26:08.750,"Using sophisticated techniques, they extract the preserved blood from the mosquito, and bingo-- dino D.N.A."
00:26:08.792,00:26:13.583,A full D.N.A. strand contains three billion genetic codes.
00:26:13.625,00:26:21.792,"If we looked at screens like these once a second for eight hours a day, it'd take two years to look at the entire D.N.A. strand."
00:26:21.834,00:26:23.792,It's that long.
00:26:23.834,00:26:27.417,"Since it's so old, it's full of holes."
00:26:27.458,00:26:30.834,Now that's where our geneticists take over.
00:26:30.875,00:26:34.250,Thinkin' machine super-computers and gene sequencers...
00:26:34.291,00:26:36.667,break down the strand in minutes.
00:26:36.709,00:26:42.625,And virtual-reality displays show our geneticists the gaps in the D.N.A. sequence.
00:26:42.667,00:26:46.667,We use the complete D.N.A. of a frog to fill in the holes...
00:26:46.709,00:26:49.667,and complete the code.
00:26:49.709,00:26:50.834,Phew!
00:26:50.875,00:26:53.458,"And now, we can make a baby dinosaur."
00:26:56.750,00:26:58.959,This score is only temporary.
00:26:59.000,00:27:01.917,"It all has very dramatic music, of course. Rum-pum-pum!"
00:27:01.959,00:27:03.959,A march or something.
00:27:04.000,00:27:07.375,"And then, of course, the tour moves on."
00:27:15.625,00:27:17.917,"Well, lookee here."
00:27:17.959,00:27:22.875,"Those hard-workin' cowpokes you see behind the glass-- This is overwhelming, John."
00:27:22.917,00:27:27.166,"Are-- Are these characters, uh, auto-erotica?"
00:27:27.208,00:27:30.125,"No, no, no, we have no animatronics here, no."
00:27:30.166,00:27:33.333,Those people are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
00:27:33.375,00:27:37.083,...D.N.A. in unfertilized emu or ostrich eggs.
00:27:37.125,00:27:40.542,Wait a minute.
00:27:40.583,00:27:44.500,Can't we see the unfertilized eggs?
00:27:44.542,00:27:51.083,"Now, a whole team of genetic engineers-- Can't-- Can't you stop these things?"
00:27:51.125,00:27:54.417,"One, two, three."
00:27:54.458,00:27:56.709,Uh-- You can't do that.
00:27:56.750,00:27:59.083,What?
00:28:01.875,00:28:06.375,A reminder-- The boat for the mainland will be leaving at 1900 hours.
00:28:06.417,00:28:11.750,All personnel be at the dock no later than 1845.
00:28:11.792,00:28:15.291,"G'day, Henry."
00:28:27.667,00:28:30.542,Oh.
00:28:33.500,00:28:36.083,"Oh, God."
00:28:36.125,00:28:38.709,I'd hoped they'd hatch before I had to go to the boat.
00:28:38.750,00:28:41.166,"Henry, Henry, Henry, why didn't you tell me?"
00:28:41.208,00:28:45.083,I insist on being here when they're born.
00:28:45.125,00:28:49.542,"Come on, come on."
00:28:49.583,00:28:53.166,"Come on, little one."
00:28:53.208,00:28:55.458,Come on.
00:28:55.500,00:28:59.667,"Come on, little one, come on."
00:28:59.709,00:29:02.458,"Come on, then."
00:29:02.500,00:29:06.166,Very good.
00:29:06.208,00:29:08.750,Very good.
00:29:08.792,00:29:11.583,"Push, come on."
00:29:11.625,00:29:14.959,"Come on, then."
00:29:15.000,00:29:17.709,There you are.
00:29:17.750,00:29:22.542,There.
00:29:22.583,00:29:26.000,They imprint on the first creature they come in contact with.
00:29:26.041,00:29:29.500,That's it.
00:29:29.542,00:29:32.291,I've been present for the birth...
00:29:32.333,00:29:35.250,of every little creature on this island.
00:29:35.291,00:29:39.000,"Well, surely not the ones that have bred in the wild."
00:29:39.041,00:29:41.291,Yes.
00:29:41.333,00:29:44.417,Population control is one of our security precautions.
00:29:44.458,00:29:49.125,There's no unauthorized breeding in Jurassic Park.
00:29:49.166,00:29:51.834,How do you know they can't breed?
00:29:51.875,00:29:54.291,"Well, because all the animals in Jurassic Park are female."
00:29:54.333,00:29:58.000,Oh.
00:29:58.041,00:29:59.250,There you are.
00:30:01.500,00:30:04.375,"Oh, my God!"
00:30:04.417,00:30:08.125,Blood temperature seems like high 80's maybe.
00:30:08.166,00:30:10.417,Wu?
00:30:10.458,00:30:13.542,Homeothermic?
00:30:13.583,00:30:15.542,That's incredible.
00:30:16.875,00:30:18.959,Ooh.
00:30:19.000,00:30:22.291,"But, um, again, how do you know they're all female?"
00:30:22.333,00:30:25.792,"What, does somebody go out in the park and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?"
00:30:25.834,00:30:27.709,We control their chromosomes.
00:30:27.750,00:30:29.625,It's really not that difficult.
00:30:29.667,00:30:32.542,All vertebrate embryos are inherently female anyway.
00:30:32.583,00:30:36.375,They require an extra hormone given at the right developmental stage to make them male.
00:30:36.417,00:30:38.291,We simply deny them that.
00:30:38.333,00:30:41.083,Deny them that?
00:30:41.125,00:30:44.208,"you're attempting is, uh, it's not possible."
00:30:44.250,00:30:48.709,"If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained."
00:30:48.750,00:30:51.333,Life breaks free-- It expands to new territories...
00:30:51.375,00:30:59.500,"and crashes through barriers painfully, maybe even dangerously, but, uh, well, there it is."
00:30:59.542,00:31:01.417,There it is.
00:31:01.458,00:31:06.250,You're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed?
00:31:06.291,00:31:11.667,"No, I'm simply saying that life, uh, finds a way."
00:31:17.750,00:31:20.625,What species is this?
00:31:20.667,00:31:23.500,"Uh, it's a Velociraptor."
00:31:27.750,00:31:29.083,You bred raptors?
00:31:42.583,00:31:48.208,"Dr. Grant, as I was saying, we laid on lunch for you before you set out into the park."
00:31:48.250,00:31:50.208,"Our gourmet chef, Alejandro-- What are they doing?"
00:31:50.250,00:31:51.875,Oh.
00:31:54.417,00:31:57.875,Feeding them.
00:32:03.291,00:32:08.709,"Alejandro's, uh, prepared a delightful menu for us."
00:32:08.750,00:32:11.542,"Uh, shall we?"
00:32:50.583,00:32:52.500,They should all be destroyed.
00:32:52.542,00:32:55.667,"Robert. Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya."
00:32:55.709,00:32:58.875,"Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, but knows more about raptors than anyone."
00:32:58.917,00:33:01.792,What kind of metabolism do they have?
00:33:01.834,00:33:04.875,"They're lethal at eight months, and I do mean lethal."
00:33:04.917,00:33:10.083,"I've hunted most things that can hunt you, but the way these things move-- Fast for a biped?"
00:33:10.125,00:33:14.417,"Fifty, sixty miles per hour, if they ever got out in the open."
00:33:14.458,00:33:17.709,"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
00:33:17.750,00:33:20.875,The viewing area is set down below here.
00:33:20.917,00:33:23.500,"With their brain cavities, we assumed that-- They're extremely intelligent."
00:33:23.542,00:33:28.083,Even problem-solving intelligence-- especially the big one.
00:33:28.125,00:33:30.792,"We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride..."
00:33:30.834,00:33:33.583,and killed all but two of the others.
00:33:33.625,00:33:40.625,"That one, when she looks at you, you can see she's working things out."
00:33:40.667,00:33:43.250,That's why we have to feed 'em like this.
00:33:43.291,00:33:45.917,She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
00:33:45.959,00:33:47.875,"The fences are electrified, though, right?"
00:33:47.917,00:33:51.166,"That's right, but they never attack the same place twice."
00:33:51.208,00:33:56.041,They were testing the fences for weaknesses systematically.
00:33:56.083,00:33:59.709,They remember.
00:34:09.000,00:34:12.166,Yes. Well.
00:34:12.208,00:34:15.375,More adventurous guests can opt for our jungle river cruise...
00:34:15.417,00:34:24.375,"or for a close-up look at our majestic winged dinosaurs-- None of these attractions are ready yet, but the park will open with the basic tour you're about to take."
00:34:24.417,00:34:27.500,Other rides will come on-line six or twelve months after that.
00:34:27.542,00:34:30.959,Absolutely spectacular designs.
00:34:31.000,00:34:35.959,"And we can charge anything we want: 2,000 a day, 10,000 a day."
00:34:36.000,00:34:39.166,Then there's the merchandise.
00:34:36.000,00:34:42.750,I can personally-- This park was not built to cater only for the super rich.
00:34:42.792,00:34:47.333,Everyone in the world has the right to enjoy these animals.
00:34:47.375,00:34:51.083,"We'll have, uh, a coupon day or something."
00:34:54.417,00:35:01.000,"Gee, the lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, um, staggers me."
00:35:01.041,00:35:03.959,"Well, thank you, Dr. Malcolm, but I think things are a little bit different..."
00:35:04.000,00:35:06.208,than you and I had feared.
00:35:06.250,00:35:09.166,Now wait a second.
00:35:06.250,00:35:12.083,"We haven't even seen the park yet, and you-- No, Donald, Donald."
00:35:12.125,00:35:15.125,I want to hear every viewpoint.
00:35:15.166,00:35:20.208,"Yeah. Don't you see the danger, uh, John, inherent in what you're doing here?"
00:35:20.250,00:35:26.083,"Genetic power's the most awesome force the planet's ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that's found his dad's gun."
00:35:26.125,00:35:33.083,"-It's hardly appropriate to start hurling generalizations-- Um, I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you're using here."
00:35:33.125,00:35:37.250,"Uh, it didn't require any discipline to attain it."
00:35:37.291,00:35:40.834,"You know, you read what others had done, and you took the next step."
00:35:40.875,00:35:46.834,"You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility... for it."
00:35:46.875,00:35:56.959,"You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunch box."
00:35:57.000,00:35:58.625,And now-- You're selling it.
00:35:58.667,00:36:00.834,- You wanna sell it. Well-- - What?
00:36:00.875,00:36:03.250,I-I don't think you're giving us our due credit.
00:36:03.291,00:36:06.834,Our scientists have done things which nobody's ever done before.
00:36:06.875,00:36:12.208,"Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."
00:36:12.250,00:36:15.917,Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction.
00:36:15.959,00:36:17.458,No.
00:36:17.500,00:36:22.834,"If I was to create a flock of condors on this island, you wouldn't have anything to say."
00:36:22.875,00:36:26.250,Hold on. This isn't some species that was obliterated by deforestation...
00:36:26.291,00:36:27.834,or the building of a dam.
00:36:27.875,00:36:34.583,"Dinosaurs, uh, uh, had their shot, and nature selected them for extinction."
00:36:34.625,00:36:39.250,"I simply don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist."
00:36:39.291,00:36:43.917,"I mean, how can we stand in the light of discovery and not act?"
00:36:43.959,00:36:45.625,"Oh, what's so great about discovery?"
00:36:45.667,00:36:49.417,"It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores."
00:36:49.458,00:36:56.417,"What you call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world."
00:36:56.458,00:37:00.500,"Well, the question is-- How can you know anything about an extinct ecosystem?"
00:37:00.542,00:37:03.834,"And, therefore, how could you ever assume that you can control it?"
00:37:03.875,00:37:06.542,You have plants in this building that are poisonous.
00:37:06.583,00:37:08.500,You picked them because they look good.
00:37:08.542,00:37:14.709,"But these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're in, and they'll defend themselves, violently, if necessary."
00:37:17.542,00:37:20.667,"Dr. Grant, if there's one person here..."
00:37:20.709,00:37:29.917,"who can appreciate what I'm trying to do-- The world has just changed so radically, and we're all running to catch up."
00:37:29.959,00:37:42.083,"I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but look-- Dinosaurs and man, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution, have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together."
00:37:42.125,00:37:46.542,How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?
00:37:47.959,00:37:50.500,I don't believe it.
00:37:50.542,00:37:58.000,"You're meant to come down here and defend me against these characters, and the only one I've got on my side is the bloodsucking lawyer."
00:37:58.041,00:37:59.375,Thank you.
00:38:04.125,00:38:08.000,Well. They're here.
00:38:08.041,00:38:10.875,You four are gonna have a spot of company out in the park.
00:38:10.917,00:38:13.834,Spend a little time with our target audience.
00:38:13.875,00:38:17.000,- Grandpa!
00:38:19.500,00:38:22.458,Careful with the old man.
00:38:22.500,00:38:25.458,Thanks for the presents.
00:38:25.500,00:38:27.333,Did you enjoy the helicopter?
00:38:27.375,00:38:30.375,"Yeah! It went down, and we all went right up."
00:38:33.291,00:38:37.166,"Now, kids, come away."
00:38:37.208,00:38:41.417,Aren't they lovely?
00:38:41.458,00:38:43.667,These will be your transports for the afternoon.
00:38:43.709,00:38:46.291,No drivers.
00:38:46.333,00:38:49.458,They're electric.
00:38:49.500,00:38:52.542,Totally nonpolluting.
00:38:52.583,00:38:55.291,"It's an interactive CD-ROM. Look, see?"
00:38:55.333,00:38:58.750,"You just touch the right part of the screen, and it talks about whatever you want."
00:38:58.792,00:39:00.625,"Lex, darling, you're all right in there."
00:39:00.667,00:39:03.709,"Dr. Sattler, come with me. Dr. Grant, come in the second car."
00:39:03.750,00:39:06.375,"I'm gonna ride with, uh, Dr. Sattler."
00:39:17.959,00:39:20.166,I read your book.
00:39:20.208,00:39:23.500,"Well, that's-- That's great."
00:39:23.542,00:39:27.709,Do you really think that dinosaurs turned into birds and that's where they all went?
00:39:27.750,00:39:31.583,"Well, a few species may have evolved along those lines."
00:39:36.208,00:39:38.667,'Cause they sure don't look like birds to me.
00:39:40.125,00:39:47.333,"I heard that there's this, um, meteor, hit the earth someplace down in Mexico and made this big crater?"
00:39:47.375,00:39:51.000,"Listen, uh-- Tim."
00:39:51.041,00:39:55.458,"Tim, which car were you planning on?"
00:39:55.500,00:39:57.709,Whichever one you are.
00:39:59.709,00:40:01.667,Then I heard about this thing in Omni...
00:40:01.709,00:40:05.291,"about this, um, meteor making all this heat."
00:40:05.333,00:40:09.500,"And it made diamond dust. That changed the weather, and they died because of the weather."
00:40:09.542,00:40:19.917,Then my teacher tells me about this book by a guy named Bakker. He says-- She said I should ride with you because it'd be good for you.
00:40:19.959,00:40:22.083,The boat is now loading.
00:40:22.125,00:40:27.542,Everyone must be on the dock for the 1900-hour departure.
00:40:27.583,00:40:30.625,National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm...
00:40:30.667,00:40:32.458,about 75 miles west of us.
00:40:32.500,00:40:35.542,Ay-yi-yi-yi.
00:40:35.583,00:40:40.500,I'll keep an eye on it.
00:40:41.583,00:40:44.875,"Ray, start the tour program."
00:40:54.291,00:40:56.959,Hold on to your butts.
00:41:04.458,00:41:10.667,put the fiberglass thing?
00:41:10.709,00:41:12.041,I know.
00:41:12.083,00:41:15.291,What kind of dinosaurs are we gonna see now?
00:41:15.333,00:41:18.917,"Hey, lookit!"
00:41:18.959,00:41:21.917,"Turn in your fear at the door and join the future, right?"
00:41:21.959,00:41:25.041,"Oh, God help us. We're in the hands of engineers."
00:41:25.083,00:41:27.750,"During most of your tour, the appropriate information..."
00:41:27.792,00:41:30.667,will be automatically selected and displayed for you.
00:41:30.709,00:41:33.417,Simply touch the area of the screen displaying...
00:41:33.458,00:41:35.333,the appropriate icon.
00:41:35.375,00:41:38.291,Welcome to Jurassic Park.
00:41:41.667,00:41:44.208,"What have they got in there, King Kong?"
00:41:58.166,00:42:00.542,The voice you're now hearing is Richard Kiley.
00:42:00.583,00:42:03.667,We spared no expense.
00:42:00.583,00:42:09.500,"If you look to the right, you will see a herd of the first dinosaurs on our tour, called Dilophosaurus."
00:42:09.542,00:42:12.000,- Dilophosaurus.
00:42:12.041,00:42:25.458,"One of the earliest carnivores, we now know Dilophosaurus is actually poisonous, spitting its venom at its prey, causing blindness and eventually paralysis, allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure."
00:42:25.500,00:42:27.500,I can't see.
00:42:27.542,00:42:30.083,a beautiful but deadly addition...
00:42:30.125,00:42:31.542,to Jurassic Park.
00:42:39.083,00:42:42.417,Alan-- where?
00:42:45.333,00:42:47.458,Damn.
00:42:52.458,00:42:54.917,"Vehicle headlights are on, and they're not responding."
00:42:54.959,00:43:00.667,Those shouldn't be running off the car batteries.
00:43:00.709,00:43:06.709,"We have all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo, and the computers aren't even on their feet yet."
00:43:06.750,00:43:12.125,"Dennis, our lives are in your hands, and you have butterfingers?"
00:43:12.166,00:43:16.125,I'm totally unappreciated in my time.
00:43:16.166,00:43:20.125,You can run this park from this room with minimal staff for up to three days.
00:43:20.166,00:43:22.333,You think that kind of automation is easy?
00:43:22.375,00:43:24.333,Or cheap?
00:43:24.375,00:43:27.041,You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines...
00:43:27.083,00:43:30.000,and debug two million lines of code for what I bid for this job?
00:43:30.041,00:43:32.000,"If you can, I'd love to see him try."
00:43:32.041,00:43:35.709,"about your financial problems, but they are your problems."
00:43:35.750,00:43:38.500,"Oh, you're right, John."
00:43:38.542,00:43:42.333,"I will not get drawn into another financial debate with you, Dennis."
00:43:42.375,00:43:46.000,I really will not.
00:43:46.041,00:43:52.250,"I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them."
00:43:52.291,00:43:54.917,"Thanks, Dad."
00:43:54.959,00:43:56.417,The headlights.
00:43:56.458,00:43:59.333,"Yeah. I'll debug the tour program when they get back, okay?"
00:43:59.375,00:44:02.667,Okay? It'll eat a lot of compute cycles. We'll lose part of the system for a while.
00:44:02.709,00:44:04.917,There's a finite amount of memory.
00:44:04.959,00:44:09.917,"You gonna compile for half an hour, for crying out loud?"
00:44:09.959,00:44:12.083,They're approaching the Tyrannosaur paddock.
00:45:01.875,00:45:07.250,God creates dinosaurs.
00:45:07.291,00:45:11.792,God creates man.
00:45:13.166,00:45:15.333,Dinosaurs...
00:45:15.375,00:45:18.166,eat man.
00:45:18.208,00:45:21.625,Woman inherits the Earth.
00:45:28.083,00:45:31.166,We'll try to tempt the rex now.
00:45:41.291,00:45:42.625,What's gonna happen to the goat?
00:45:47.375,00:45:52.000,He's gonna eat the goat?
00:45:52.041,00:45:55.625,"What's the matter, kid?"
00:45:55.667,00:45:58.667,I happen to be a vegetarian.
00:46:06.542,00:46:10.667,T. rex doesn't want to be fed.
00:46:10.709,00:46:15.750,You can't just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct.
00:46:37.333,00:46:40.208,"Uh, uh, now, eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs..."
00:46:40.250,00:46:43.250,"on your, on your dinosaur tour, right?"
00:46:43.291,00:46:46.458,Hello? H-Hello.
00:46:46.500,00:46:48.917,Yes?
00:46:48.959,00:46:51.542,I really hate that man.
00:46:56.291,00:47:00.667,"See, the tyrannosaur, uh, doesn't obey any set patterns or-- or park schedules."
00:47:00.709,00:47:03.667,"The essence, uh, of chaos."
00:47:03.709,00:47:07.291,"Um, I'm still not clear on chaos."
00:47:07.333,00:47:11.500,"Oh, oh, it simply deals with, uh, unpredictability in complex systems."
00:47:13.041,00:47:15.500,The shorthand is the-- the Butterfly Effect.
00:47:15.542,00:47:19.792,"A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking, and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine."
00:47:23.125,00:47:26.000,Did I go too fast?
00:47:26.041,00:47:28.750,Give me that glass of water.
00:47:28.792,00:47:31.917,It should be still.
00:47:31.959,00:47:35.458,"Now, put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic."
00:47:35.500,00:47:37.750,Let's say a drop of water falls on your hand.
00:47:37.792,00:47:40.792,Which way is the drop going to fall off? Which finger?
00:47:40.834,00:47:44.083,"Thumb, I'd say."
00:47:44.125,00:47:47.083,Aha. Okay.
00:47:47.125,00:47:50.291,"I'm going to do the same thing, start with the same place again."
00:47:50.333,00:47:53.250,Which way is it going to roll off?
00:47:53.291,00:47:55.500,S-Same way.
00:47:55.542,00:47:57.875,It changed.
00:47:57.917,00:48:02.041,It changed. Why?
00:47:57.917,00:48:05.875,"Because tiny variations, uh, the orientation of the hairs on your hands-- Hey, Alan, look at this."
00:48:05.917,00:48:12.875,"Um, the amount of blood distending your vessels, imperfections in the skin-- Imperfections in the skin?"
00:48:12.917,00:48:15.792,And never repeat and vastly affect the outcome.
00:48:15.834,00:48:18.208,That's... what?
00:48:18.250,00:48:19.709,Right.
00:48:20.959,00:48:23.917,There.
00:48:23.959,00:48:26.417,I'm right again.
00:48:23.959,00:48:30.625,"Nobody could've predicted that Dr. Grant would suddenly, suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle."
00:48:30.667,00:48:33.375,Alan!
00:48:33.417,00:48:37.667,"See, here I'm now by myself, uh, talking to myself."
00:48:37.709,00:48:40.166,"That's, that's chaos theory."
00:48:40.208,00:48:43.500,Stop the program.
00:48:44.959,00:48:47.625,I told you how many times...
00:48:47.667,00:48:50.417,we needed locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors?
00:48:50.458,00:48:52.834,Stopping ride vehicles and rebooting program.
00:48:52.875,00:48:56.333,We're on.
00:48:56.375,00:48:59.875,Switch over to check.
00:48:59.917,00:49:01.834,What about the circuit integrities?
00:49:01.875,00:49:04.250,Screen says faulty sensor.
00:49:06.834,00:49:09.625,We're a full go on that.
00:49:09.667,00:49:16.834,"Like I was saying, there's this other book by a guy named Bakker, - and he says the dinosaurs died of a bunch of diseases."
00:49:16.875,00:49:18.542,You see something?
00:49:18.583,00:49:21.000,Is there anybody else who thinks we shouldn't be out here?
00:49:21.041,00:49:24.667,His book was a lot fatter than yours was.
00:49:24.709,00:49:27.917,"Yours was fully illustrated, honey."
00:49:27.959,00:49:29.458,You okay?
00:49:29.500,00:49:32.458,"Hey, look at this."
00:49:32.500,00:49:35.417,"Hey, come on."
00:49:35.458,00:49:37.709,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:49:40.083,00:49:41.583,Everybody stay here.
00:49:49.083,00:49:51.208,Timmy!
00:49:49.083,00:50:00.250,"Hey, Timmy-- Oh, wow."
00:50:00.291,00:50:02.041,Okay?
00:50:04.750,00:50:08.583,Don't be scared. It's okay.
00:50:08.625,00:50:11.125,She's sick.
00:50:11.166,00:50:13.792,"Oh, my God."
00:50:17.000,00:50:20.000,"Oh, my God."
00:50:23.583,00:50:27.083,"Hey! Hey, baby."
00:50:27.125,00:50:29.166,"Oh. Oh, God."
00:50:36.000,00:50:37.417,"Hey, baby girl."
00:50:37.458,00:50:40.250,Yeah.
00:50:43.291,00:50:45.208,She was my favorite when I was a kid.
00:50:45.250,00:50:48.959,"Now I see her, she's the most beautiful thing I ever saw."
00:50:52.667,00:50:55.625,It's okay.
00:50:57.792,00:51:00.875,Microvesicles.
00:51:02.375,00:51:05.250,Thanks.
00:51:05.291,00:51:08.250,"Oh, imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing."
00:51:08.291,00:51:11.375,It seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
00:51:25.875,00:51:28.250,These are dilated.
00:51:28.291,00:51:30.834,It's okay.
00:51:30.875,00:51:34.750,That's pharmacological.
00:51:41.875,00:51:44.709,Is this West Indian lilac?
00:51:44.750,00:51:49.166,"Yes. We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat 'em."
00:51:52.500,00:51:55.166,Are you sure?
00:51:56.875,00:51:59.834,There's only one way to be positive.
00:51:59.875,00:52:03.458,I'd have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
00:52:03.500,00:52:07.417,Dino...
00:52:10.667,00:52:15.625,Yep. Yep.
00:52:15.667,00:52:19.000,That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course.
00:52:19.041,00:52:21.500,"We're gonna have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid."
00:52:21.542,00:52:24.667,Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
00:52:24.709,00:52:27.083,It's not worth taking the chance.
00:52:24.709,00:52:30.625,"Well-- Sustained winds, 45 knots."
00:52:30.667,00:52:33.000,"Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle leaving for the dock..."
00:52:33.041,00:52:35.291,leaves in approximately five minutes.
00:52:35.333,00:52:38.000,Drop what you're doing and leave now.
00:52:40.041,00:52:41.208,Damn!
00:52:48.709,00:52:51.375,That is one big pile of shit.
00:52:55.625,00:52:58.083,Okay.
00:52:58.125,00:53:00.834,You're right.
00:53:00.875,00:53:03.250,That's so odd though.
00:53:03.291,00:53:08.250,"All right, so she's suffering from Melia toxicity..."
00:53:08.291,00:53:10.959,every six weeks.
00:53:12.625,00:53:16.834,Let's see.
00:53:16.875,00:53:20.667,Every six weeks.
00:53:20.709,00:53:24.667,You have no idea.
00:53:24.709,00:53:28.583,You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
00:53:40.959,00:53:44.959,"Doctors, if you please, I have to insist that we get moving."
00:53:47.041,00:53:51.250,"You know, if it's all right, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish up with the trike."
00:53:51.291,00:53:53.375,Sure. I'm in a gas-powered jeep.
00:53:53.417,00:53:56.166,I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
00:53:56.208,00:53:59.166,Great. Then I'll catch up with you if you want to go on.
00:53:59.208,00:54:03.000,You sure?
00:54:03.041,00:54:04.834,"Okay, then."
00:54:04.875,00:54:06.333,Now!
00:54:19.458,00:54:24.041,There's nothing I can do.
00:54:24.083,00:54:27.709,You gotta give me the time.
00:54:27.750,00:54:31.375,"I could maybe push it to 18, but you gotta give me at least 15 minutes."
00:54:31.417,00:54:34.333,No promises!
00:54:40.750,00:54:44.875,Visitor vehicles are returning to the garage.
00:54:44.917,00:54:46.959,So much for our first tour.
00:54:47.000,00:54:52.000,Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.
00:54:52.041,00:54:56.250,"It could've been worse, John. A lot worse."
00:54:56.291,00:54:58.458,Anybody want a soda or something?
00:54:58.500,00:55:02.500,I'm going to the machine.
00:55:02.542,00:55:04.625,"I've had only sweets, and I'm gonna get something salty."
00:55:04.667,00:55:13.208,"I thought maybe somebody would, uh-- Oh, I finished debugging the phones. I was gonna debu-- So I did."
00:55:13.250,00:55:15.667,"You told me to, uh, so I debugged the phones."
00:55:15.709,00:55:19.458,"And I thought maybe, uh-- Oh, I should tell you the system is gonna be compiling..."
00:55:19.500,00:55:21.417,"for, uh, 18 to 20 minutes."
00:55:21.458,00:55:24.417,"Some of the monitor systems might go on or off, but it's nothing to worry about."
00:55:24.458,00:55:26.583,It's just a simple thing.
00:55:48.041,00:55:51.333,You got any kids?
00:55:51.375,00:55:54.458,I love kids.
00:55:54.500,00:55:57.542,Anything at all can and does happen.
00:55:57.583,00:56:01.500,"Same with wives, for that matter."
00:56:01.542,00:56:04.792,Occasionally.
00:56:01.542,00:56:08.417,"Uh, yeah-- I'm-I'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm."
00:56:22.208,00:56:27.667,"Five, four, three, two, one."
00:56:35.667,00:56:37.917,That's odd.
00:56:37.959,00:56:42.375,Door security systems are shutting down.
00:56:42.417,00:56:45.583,"Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?"
00:57:41.709,00:57:47.041,"By the way, Dr. Sattler, um, she's not, like, available, is she?"
00:57:47.083,00:57:51.959,Why?
00:57:52.000,00:57:54.959,"You two are, uh-- Yeah."
00:57:55.000,00:57:58.208,"Hey, what'd I touch?"
00:57:58.250,00:58:00.959,"Uh, you didn't touch anything."
00:58:08.834,00:58:11.959,"Whoa, whoa."
00:58:12.000,00:58:15.000,What now?
00:58:15.041,00:58:16.875,Find Nedry!
00:58:49.083,00:58:52.709,Look at this workstation.
00:58:52.750,00:58:55.709,"The raptor fences aren't out, are they?"
00:59:00.208,00:59:03.458,"No, no."
00:59:05.500,00:59:08.458,Why the hell would he turn the other ones off?
00:59:48.750,00:59:53.083,Access main program.
00:59:53.125,00:59:54.709,Access main program grid.
01:00:03.000,01:00:06.709,"Uh, uh, uh!"
01:00:06.750,01:00:09.208,"Uh, uh, uh!"
01:00:09.250,01:00:14.417,I hate this hacker crap!
01:00:14.458,01:00:18.583,"Uh, uh, uh!"
01:00:18.625,01:00:20.709,"Uh, uh, uh!"
01:00:20.750,01:00:23.166,Where did the vehicles stop?
01:00:44.000,01:00:47.458,Their radio's out too.
01:00:47.500,01:00:49.959,Kids okay?
01:00:50.041,01:00:52.750,Kids get scared.
01:00:52.792,01:00:55.834,It's just a little hiccup in the power.
01:00:55.875,01:00:58.667,I didn't say you were scared.
01:00:58.709,01:01:01.458,Boo!
01:01:01.500,01:01:05.542,"Hey, where did you find those?"
01:01:05.583,01:01:08.041,Are they heavy?
01:01:08.083,01:01:10.834,Then they're expensive.
01:01:16.875,01:01:19.333,Don't scare me.
01:01:28.709,01:01:32.458,"Oh, cool. Night vision."
01:01:55.208,01:01:57.792,Do you feel that?
01:02:33.000,01:02:35.750,Maybe it's the power tryin' to come back on.
01:02:35.792,01:02:39.750,What is that?
01:02:53.417,01:02:57.417,Where's the goat?
01:03:20.667,01:03:21.709,"Oh, Jesus!"
01:03:26.959,01:03:29.166,He left us. He left us.
01:03:39.959,01:03:42.792,Where does he think he's going?
01:03:42.834,01:03:45.208,"When you gotta go, you gotta go."
01:04:01.125,01:04:03.917,Dr. Grant?
01:04:15.834,01:04:19.083,"Boy, do I hate being right all the time."
01:04:28.041,01:04:32.625,Keep absolutely still.
01:04:46.333,01:04:50.709,Turn the light off.
01:04:52.959,01:04:54.375,Turn the light off!
01:05:50.041,01:05:53.083,Turn-- Turn it off!
01:05:53.125,01:05:56.417,I'm sorry!
01:05:56.458,01:06:41.417,You're the one who turned it-- No!
01:07:00.000,01:07:05.125,Hey!
01:07:05.166,01:07:07.166,"Oh, God."
01:07:15.041,01:07:19.792,- Hey-hey! Hey-hey!
01:07:19.834,01:07:23.959,Get the kids!
01:07:24.000,01:07:27.917,Get the kids!
01:07:29.875,01:07:32.709,"Hail Mary, full of grace."
01:07:29.875,01:07:34.792,The Lord be with thee-- Aaah!
01:07:49.208,01:07:56.625,No! No! Aaah-- Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant!
01:07:59.375,01:08:03.458,I'm stuck!
01:08:03.500,01:08:06.333,I'll get you next.
01:08:06.375,01:08:11.166,Come on. Good.
01:08:14.333,01:08:17.375,Don't move. He can't see us if we don't move.
01:08:54.542,01:08:57.125,"This way-- No, no, wait!"
01:08:59.333,01:09:02.750,Timmy? Timmy!
01:09:22.417,01:09:24.667,Lex! Lex!
01:09:27.375,01:09:29.625,Grab the wire!
01:09:48.000,01:09:52.500,"Keycheck space minus O, keychecks off, safety space minus O."
01:09:52.542,01:09:56.417,He's turning the safety systems off. He doesn't want anybody to see what he's about to do.
01:09:56.458,01:09:59.417,Look at this next entry.
01:09:59.458,01:10:03.291,"It did it all, but with the keychecks off, the computer didn't file the keystrokes."
01:10:03.333,01:10:07.000,The only way to find them is to go through the computer's lines of code one by one.
01:10:07.041,01:10:09.875,How many lines of code are there?
01:10:09.917,01:10:11.625,Two million?
01:10:14.750,01:10:18.083,"Robert, I-- I wonder if perhaps you would be good enough..."
01:10:18.125,01:10:23.917,to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
01:10:23.959,01:10:25.667,Sure.
01:10:28.291,01:10:30.125,I'm going with him.
01:10:31.750,01:10:36.875,John. John?
01:10:31.750,01:10:40.041,"The magic word, the magic word-- Uh, uh, uh!"
01:10:40.083,01:10:43.834,I can't get Jurassic Park back online without Dennis Nedry.
01:10:46.542,01:10:48.792,Should have been there by now.
01:10:50.667,01:10:51.625,No damn good.
01:11:02.667,01:11:04.667,"Oh, damn!"
01:11:11.417,01:11:12.875,There's the road.
01:11:19.625,01:11:24.291,"Winch this sucker off the thing, and then I tie it to that thing there, and then I..."
01:11:24.333,01:11:31.166,pull down this thing here and I-- Oh. Oh!
01:11:34.834,01:11:38.834,My glasses!
01:11:52.709,01:11:54.792,"Oh, geez!"
01:12:08.000,01:12:10.291,"You got time, you got time."
01:12:10.333,01:12:12.834,You can do it.
01:12:18.959,01:12:21.000,Hello?
01:12:23.542,01:12:27.834,"Ha! Yeah, yeah, that's nice. Gotta go."
01:12:37.041,01:12:41.208,"Oh. Ah, nice boy."
01:12:41.250,01:12:44.667,Nice dinosaur.
01:12:44.709,01:12:48.083,I thought you were one of your big brothers.
01:12:48.125,01:12:51.417,What do you want?
01:12:51.458,01:12:53.834,I just fell down a hill.
01:12:53.875,01:12:58.917,I have no food on me.
01:12:58.959,01:13:01.542,Play fetch?
01:13:01.583,01:13:03.583,"Look, see?"
01:13:03.625,01:13:06.208,See stick?
01:13:06.250,01:13:10.667,"Look, stick."
01:13:10.709,01:13:12.709,You like the stick?
01:13:12.750,01:13:14.875,No wonder you're extinct.
01:13:16.750,01:13:18.792,I'm gonna run you over when I come back down.
01:13:49.959,01:13:51.083,Aaah!
01:13:51.125,01:13:54.667,Aaah!
01:14:35.291,01:14:37.667,Timmy? Timmy!
01:14:37.709,01:14:40.917,Tim!
01:14:40.959,01:14:45.917,"Now, Lex, listen, listen to me."
01:14:45.959,01:14:48.542,"I'm gonna look after you, but I have to go help your brother."
01:14:48.583,01:14:51.125,So I want you to stay right here and wait for me.
01:14:51.166,01:14:54.000,He left us.
01:14:54.041,01:14:56.709,But that's not...
01:14:58.417,01:15:01.959,Okay?
01:15:02.000,01:15:02.875,Stay here.
01:15:11.709,01:15:12.625,Timmy?
01:15:26.792,01:15:27.750,Tim?
01:15:30.458,01:15:33.333,You hear me?
01:15:33.375,01:15:37.000,I hate climbing.
01:15:38.375,01:15:40.250,"Oh, goddamn tree."
01:15:43.291,01:15:44.875,"Hey, Tim?"
01:15:48.333,01:15:50.625,Tim?
01:15:58.500,01:16:00.041,Tim.
01:16:05.458,01:16:09.458,You okay?
01:16:09.500,01:16:12.000,I threw up.
01:16:12.041,01:16:14.458,"Oh. Oh, that's okay."
01:16:15.959,01:16:17.542,Just give me your hand.
01:16:21.709,01:16:23.667,"Hey, Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up."
01:16:23.709,01:16:26.417,"Just, just give me your hand."
01:16:34.834,01:16:39.667,"Here, I gotcha."
01:16:39.709,01:16:44.208,That's good.
01:16:44.250,01:16:48.166,No hurry.
01:16:48.208,01:16:50.417,Stand on the door.
01:16:50.458,01:16:53.917,"Okay, I got you."
01:16:53.959,01:16:57.083,"Okay, that's not too bad, right, Tim?"
01:16:57.125,01:17:00.041,Just like coming out of a tree house. Did your dad ever build you a tree house?
01:17:00.083,01:17:03.166,No.
01:17:03.208,01:17:07.000,"The thing about climbing is you never, never look down."
01:17:07.041,01:17:09.875,How am I gonna do this?
01:17:07.041,01:17:18.208,"It's about 50-- 50 feet-- I'm gonna help you-- Oh, no."
01:17:40.458,01:17:43.000,"Oh! Go, go, go!"
01:17:50.875,01:17:51.792,"Faster, Tim!"
01:17:58.959,01:18:00.166,"Tim, jump!"
01:18:03.875,01:18:04.709,"Go, Tim."
01:18:12.166,01:18:16.834,"Well, we're back..."
01:18:16.875,01:18:19.750,"Well, at least you're out of the tree."
01:18:25.875,01:18:29.709,Where's the other car?
01:18:30.417,01:18:34.250,Alan!
01:18:34.291,01:18:37.834,Alan!
01:18:39.917,01:18:42.709,Grant!
01:18:50.166,01:18:54.792,I think this was Gennaro.
01:18:54.834,01:18:58.792,I think it's ahead of us.
01:18:58.834,01:19:02.458,"It could be anywhere. With the fences down, it can wander in and out of any paddock it likes."
01:19:07.917,01:19:09.709,"Oh, God."
01:19:09.750,01:19:13.959,He put a tourniquet on.
01:19:14.000,01:19:17.125,Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.
01:19:21.875,01:19:24.250,Can we chance moving him?
01:19:24.291,01:19:26.250,Please chance it.
01:19:32.375,01:19:36.208,"Ellie, come on!"
01:19:36.250,01:19:37.834,"Wait, wait."
01:19:43.542,01:19:45.417,The other car!
01:19:45.458,01:19:46.792,Dr. Grant?
01:19:48.959,01:19:51.625,Alan!
01:19:51.667,01:19:55.333,They're not here.
01:20:22.125,01:20:24.959,Anybody hear that?
01:20:25.000,01:20:30.625,"It's a, um-- It's an impact tremor is what it is."
01:20:30.667,01:20:33.709,I'm fairly alarmed here.
01:20:33.750,01:20:37.458,"Come on, come on, come on."
01:20:37.500,01:20:39.959,"Go, go, go!"
01:20:41.583,01:20:43.041,Start the engine!
01:20:50.667,01:20:54.041,Must go faster.
01:20:54.083,01:20:57.750,Here it comes!
01:21:04.291,01:21:06.125,Get off the stick!
01:21:06.166,01:21:07.917,Look out!
01:21:34.375,01:21:36.625,Think they'll have that on the tour?
01:21:44.792,01:21:46.792,Are you hearing this?
01:21:52.834,01:21:56.125,"Come on, Tim."
01:21:56.166,01:22:00.959,"Let's, uh, get up this tree."
01:22:01.000,01:22:04.667,"Come on, Tim, it's okay. Try up here."
01:22:04.709,01:22:08.125,Okay.
01:22:08.166,01:22:11.417,I hate trees.
01:22:11.458,01:22:13.375,"Oh, yeah, well, you weren't in the last one."
01:22:26.667,01:22:31.125,"Hey, those are Brontosauruses."
01:22:31.166,01:22:34.458,They're singing.
01:23:00.458,01:23:04.125,"Shh, shh!"
01:23:04.166,01:23:06.500,Don't let the monsters come over here.
01:23:06.542,01:23:09.166,They're just animals.
01:23:09.208,01:23:13.000,"That means they only eat vegetables, but for you I think they'd make an exception."
01:23:13.041,01:23:14.750,Tim.
01:23:16.583,01:23:21.041,The other kind just...
01:23:34.083,01:23:36.125,Ooh! Aah!
01:23:39.792,01:23:41.709,What is that?
01:23:46.291,01:23:49.750,What are you and Ellie gonna do now if you don't have to pick up dinosaur bones anymore?
01:23:51.375,01:23:56.500,I don't know.
01:23:59.959,01:24:03.792,What do you call a blind dinosaur?
01:24:03.834,01:24:06.500,I don't know.
01:24:06.542,01:24:09.208,Do-you-think-he-saurus.
01:24:12.125,01:24:16.709,What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
01:24:16.750,01:24:19.792,A do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
01:24:19.834,01:24:23.417,Alan?
01:24:23.458,01:24:28.333,Yeah?
01:24:28.375,01:24:31.125,"Well, I'll stay awake."
01:24:31.166,01:24:34.333,All night?
01:24:34.375,01:24:35.667,All night.
01:25:22.125,01:25:25.834,Hmm.
01:25:25.875,01:25:28.625,They were all melting.
01:25:31.250,01:25:34.709,Malcolm's okay for now.
01:25:38.208,01:25:41.000,They'll be fine.
01:25:41.041,01:25:45.041,Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
01:25:49.458,01:25:52.750,You know the first...
01:25:52.792,01:25:57.667,attraction I ever built when I came down from Scotland...
01:25:57.709,01:26:01.500,"was a flea circus, Petticoat Lane."
01:26:01.542,01:26:04.041,Really quite wonderful.
01:26:04.083,01:26:15.458,"We had, uh, a wee trapeze and, uh, a merry-go-- A carousel."
01:26:15.500,01:26:18.458,And a seesaw.
01:26:18.500,01:26:22.166,"They all move, motorized, of course, but, uh, people would say they could see the fleas."
01:26:22.208,01:26:25.583,"Oh, I can see the fleas, Mummy."
01:26:25.625,01:26:30.000,Clown fleas and high-wire fleas and fleas on parade.
01:26:36.333,01:26:44.375,"But with this place, I wanted to show them something that wasn't an illusion."
01:26:44.417,01:26:46.625,Something that was real.
01:26:46.667,01:26:50.625,Something that they could...
01:26:50.667,01:26:54.709,see and touch.
01:26:56.709,01:26:59.834,An aim not devoid of merit.
01:27:04.083,01:27:07.792,"But you can't think through this one, John."
01:27:07.834,01:27:13.458,You're right.
01:27:13.500,01:27:17.375,Hiring Nedry was a mistake.
01:27:17.417,01:27:20.792,I can see that now.
01:27:20.834,01:27:22.834,John.
01:27:22.875,01:27:27.458,is an act of sheer will.
01:27:27.500,01:27:29.834,"Next time, it'll be flawless."
01:27:29.875,01:27:33.709,It's still the flea circus.
01:27:33.750,01:27:38.000,When we have control again-- You've never had control.
01:27:38.041,01:27:41.709,I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.
01:27:41.750,01:27:43.500,But I made a mistake too.
01:27:43.542,01:27:47.542,"I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now."
01:27:49.875,01:27:51.417,The only thing that matters now...
01:27:51.458,01:27:55.166,are the people we love.
01:27:55.208,01:27:59.125,Alan and Lex and Tim.
01:27:59.166,01:28:03.875,"John, they're out there where people are dying."
01:28:09.834,01:28:21.667,So-- It's good.
01:28:24.208,01:28:26.041,Spared no expense.
01:28:53.083,01:28:56.834,Go away!
01:28:56.875,01:28:59.709,"It's a Veggie-saurus, Lex, Veggie-saurus."
01:28:59.750,01:29:04.000,Veggie.
01:29:04.041,01:29:06.583,Come on.
01:29:06.625,01:29:09.208,Come on.
01:29:12.208,01:29:16.166,Yo! All right!
01:29:16.208,01:29:20.083,I'm not letting go!
01:29:28.917,01:29:32.500,Looks like it has a cold.
01:29:32.542,01:29:34.917,Can I touch it?
01:29:34.959,01:29:39.625,Just think of it as...
01:29:39.667,01:29:43.542,I like cows.
01:29:52.375,01:29:54.709,"Hey, come on, girl."
01:29:54.750,01:29:56.750,"Come on, up here."
01:30:02.125,01:30:04.542,God bless you!
01:30:08.917,01:30:13.500,Yuck!
01:30:13.542,01:30:16.500,She'll just sit in her room and never come out and play on her computer.
01:30:16.542,01:30:19.500,I'm a hacker.
01:30:19.542,01:30:22.709,I am not a computer nerd.
01:30:22.750,01:30:27.166,"Oh, God."
01:30:28.834,01:30:32.417,You know what this is?
01:30:32.458,01:30:35.000,It's a dinosaur egg.
01:30:35.041,01:30:39.834,The dinosaurs...
01:30:41.542,01:30:46.625,But my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
01:30:46.667,01:30:50.375,Amphibian D.N.A.
01:30:50.417,01:30:55.000,"Well, on the tour, the film said they used..."
01:30:55.041,01:30:59.458,frog D.N.A. to fill in the gene sequence gaps.
01:30:59.500,01:31:02.834,They mutated the dinosaur genetic code...
01:31:02.875,01:31:05.834,and blended it with that of frogs.
01:31:05.875,01:31:11.125,"Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex..."
01:31:11.166,01:31:16.250,from male to female in a single sex environment.
01:31:16.291,01:31:20.208,Malcolm was right.
01:31:29.041,01:31:32.959,Life found a way.
01:31:33.000,01:31:37.375,"No, no, no, that's crazy."
01:31:37.417,01:31:40.583,"Wait a minute, what exactly would this mean?"
01:31:40.625,01:31:44.792,"We're talking about a calculated risk, which is about the only option left to us."
01:31:44.834,01:31:49.750,We will never find the command that Nedry used. He's covered his tracks far too well.
01:31:49.792,01:31:52.458,I think it's obvious now that he's not coming back.
01:31:52.500,01:31:58.125,"So, shutting down the entire system-- You can get somebody else, because I won't do it."
01:31:58.166,01:32:03.417,Shutting down the system is the only way to wipe out everything that he did.
01:32:03.458,01:32:07.083,"Now, as I understand it, all the systems will then come back..."
01:32:07.125,01:32:09.875,"on their original start-up mode, correct?"
01:32:09.917,01:32:13.166,"Theoretically, yes."
01:32:13.208,01:32:16.041,It may not come back on at all.
01:32:16.083,01:32:18.542,"Yes, again, in theory."
01:32:18.583,01:32:21.083,What about the lysine contingency?
01:32:21.125,01:32:23.166,We could put that into effect.
01:32:23.208,01:32:25.166,That is absolutely out of the question.
01:32:25.208,01:32:28.125,The lysine contingency is intended to prevent the spread of the animals...
01:32:28.166,01:32:30.375,in case they ever get off the island.
01:32:30.417,01:32:34.041,Dr. Wu inserted a gene that creates a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.
01:32:34.083,01:32:37.166,The animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.
01:32:37.208,01:32:40.583,"Unless they're completely supplied with lysine by us, they slip into a coma and die."
01:32:40.625,01:32:43.917,People... are... dying.
01:32:47.291,01:32:50.291,Will you please shut down the system?
01:33:11.959,01:33:13.834,Hold on to your butts.
01:33:21.083,01:33:22.500,Um.
01:33:33.417,01:33:35.709,It's okay.
01:33:35.750,01:33:39.542,It's on.
01:33:39.583,01:33:41.959,Wait a minute.
01:33:42.000,01:33:43.917,Maybe the shutdown tripped the circuit breakers.
01:33:43.959,01:33:49.959,"All we have to do is turn them back on, reboot a few systems-- telephones, security doors, half a dozen others-- but it worked."
01:33:50.000,01:33:52.291,System's ready.
01:33:52.333,01:33:54.291,"Maintenance shed, the other end of the compound."
01:33:54.333,01:33:57.000,"Three minutes, I can have power back on in the entire park."
01:33:57.041,01:34:00.208,"Just to be safe, I want everybody in the emergency bunker..."
01:34:00.250,01:34:04.083,"until Mr. Arnold returns, and the whole system is running again."
01:34:04.125,01:34:06.000,I'm tired. I'm hot.
01:34:06.041,01:34:08.417,"Just keep going, guys."
01:34:08.458,01:34:12.917,It says the visitors center is just about a mile over that rise there.
01:34:12.959,01:34:19.208,Just... keep-- What is that?
01:34:19.250,01:34:22.458,"Tim. Tim, can you tell me what they are?"
01:34:25.000,01:34:31.583,"Gr-- Ga, uh, uh, Galla-- Uh, Gallimimus."
01:34:31.625,01:34:34.792,"Are-- Are those, um, meat-eating?"
01:34:34.834,01:34:36.959,"Um, meat-asauruses?"
01:34:42.959,01:34:44.750,Look at the wheeling.
01:34:44.792,01:34:48.875,Just like a flock of birds evading a predator.
01:34:48.917,01:34:52.542,"They're, uh-- They're flocking this way."
01:35:35.250,01:35:37.458,I wanna go now.
01:35:37.500,01:35:41.375,Please.
01:35:41.417,01:35:45.667,Yes.
01:35:45.709,01:35:50.542,Okay. Keep low and follow me.
01:35:50.583,01:35:53.041,Look how much blood.
01:35:53.083,01:35:54.542,Tim.
01:35:54.583,01:35:57.458,"Oh, God."
01:35:57.500,01:36:00.041,Something's happened.
01:36:00.083,01:36:01.917,Something's wrong.
01:36:04.041,01:36:06.291,This is just a delay.
01:36:06.333,01:36:09.208,All major theme parks have delays.
01:36:09.250,01:36:13.500,"When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked."
01:36:13.542,01:36:19.250,"But, John, if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don't eat the tourists."
01:36:19.291,01:36:22.917,Something went wrong.
01:36:22.959,01:36:25.500,"You can't just stroll down the road, you know."
01:36:25.542,01:36:28.917,Don't let's be too hasty.
01:36:25.542,01:36:34.333,He's only been gone-- - I'm going with you.
01:36:48.500,01:36:50.458,Sorry.
01:36:54.542,01:37:02.208,"This isn't going to be just like switching on the kitchen light, but I think I can follow this and then talk you through it."
01:37:06.542,01:37:08.458,Right.
01:37:12.458,01:37:16.166,"But, uh, it ought to be me really going."
01:37:16.208,01:37:20.375,Why?
01:37:16.208,01:37:23.125,"Well, I'm a-- And you're, um-- - Look."
01:37:23.166,01:37:26.333,We can discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.
01:37:26.375,01:37:29.875,You just take me through this step-by-step.
01:37:29.917,01:37:32.000,Right.
01:38:02.959,01:38:07.166,"Oh, God."
01:38:07.208,01:38:10.375,The shutdown must have turned off all the fences.
01:38:10.417,01:38:13.417,Damn it. Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fences.
01:38:19.875,01:38:20.875,"Come on, this way."
01:38:27.500,01:38:30.500,I can see the shed from here.
01:38:30.542,01:38:32.834,We can make it if we run.
01:38:32.875,01:38:36.291,No. We can't.
01:38:36.333,01:38:37.834,Why not?
01:38:37.875,01:38:39.542,Because we're being hunted.
01:38:39.583,01:38:41.208,"Oh, God."
01:38:41.250,01:38:43.417,"From the bushes, straight ahead."
01:38:45.959,01:38:50.667,It's all right.
01:38:50.709,01:38:55.667,Run.
01:38:55.709,01:38:58.333,I've got her.
01:38:58.375,01:39:00.125,Go! Now!
01:39:19.125,01:39:22.083,Mr. Arnold?
01:39:24.417,01:39:27.458,Mr. Arnold?
01:39:27.500,01:39:32.667,"Great. Now, ahead of you is a metal staircase."
01:39:32.709,01:39:38.041,Go down it.
01:39:38.083,01:39:41.792,"After 20 or 30 feet, you come to a T-junction."
01:39:41.834,01:39:44.917,Have her follow the main cable.
01:40:14.917,01:40:17.542,I guess that means the power's off.
01:40:30.583,01:40:33.333,That's not funny.
01:40:35.667,01:40:58.083,"Well, maybe, we could-- Damn it."
01:40:58.125,01:41:00.583,"Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute."
01:41:00.625,01:41:04.542,There should have been a right turn back there somewhere.
01:41:04.583,01:41:06.291,"Ellie, look above you."
01:41:08.542,01:41:11.500,There should be a large bundle of cable and pipes all heading in the same direction.
01:41:11.542,01:41:15.583,- Follow that.
01:41:18.125,01:41:20.333,"Timmy, I bet I could climb over the top..."
01:41:20.375,01:41:23.000,and be on the other side before you could get to the top.
01:41:23.041,01:41:26.458,What would you give me?
01:41:26.500,01:41:28.625,"Come on, guys."
01:41:30.000,01:41:35.291,I see the box.
01:41:35.333,01:41:37.875,Yeah. Okay.
01:41:37.917,01:41:40.125,Okay.
01:41:44.000,01:41:49.417,Good. Here we go.
01:41:49.458,01:41:53.125,"Take your time, Tim."
01:41:53.166,01:41:56.875,Find your footing.
01:41:56.917,01:42:00.834,"Ellie, you can't throw the main switch by hand."
01:42:00.875,01:42:04.291,You've got to pump up the primer handle in order to get the charge.
01:42:04.333,01:42:07.083,"It's large, flat and gray."
01:42:07.125,01:42:10.667,"All right, here I go. Okay?"
01:42:10.709,01:42:16.291,"One, two, three, four."
01:42:16.333,01:42:18.667,Okay. Charged.
01:42:18.709,01:42:25.458,"Under the words contact position, there's a round, green button which says, push to close."
01:42:25.500,01:42:30.083,Push to close.
01:42:30.125,01:42:32.208,Push it.
01:42:39.917,01:42:42.625,- Ah!
01:42:45.750,01:42:52.250,"Now, Ellie, the red buttons turn on the individual park systems."
01:42:52.291,01:42:53.291,Switch 'em on.
01:43:04.709,01:43:06.959,Timmy! You're gonna have to jump!
01:43:07.000,01:43:09.417,You crazy?
01:43:09.458,01:43:12.333,Do what Dr. Grant says!
01:43:09.458,01:43:15.333,"Let go! I'll count to three! One, two, three!"
01:43:15.375,01:43:18.083,Control room.
01:43:18.125,01:43:21.583,I'm coming up.
01:43:21.625,01:43:23.750,Okay. I'm gonna count to three.
01:43:25.625,01:43:36.375,"One, two-- Timmy!"
01:43:41.709,01:43:42.709,He's not breathing.
01:43:47.625,01:43:51.542,"Mr. Hammond, I think we're back in business."
01:43:51.583,01:43:53.875,"Oh, my God!"
01:43:58.875,01:44:00.875,Goddamn!
01:44:10.291,01:44:12.834,"Oh, Mr. Arnold."
01:45:28.375,01:45:31.792,- Clever girl.
01:45:52.041,01:45:52.875,Tim!
01:45:55.709,01:45:56.542,"No, Tim!"
01:46:00.000,01:46:03.458,"Good boy, good boy."
01:46:03.500,01:46:06.375,"Good boy, good boy, Tim."
01:46:06.417,01:46:09.333,Three.
01:46:12.542,01:46:14.834,Hello?
01:46:24.041,01:46:30.834,"Okay. I'm gonna have to find the others, get you to a doctor."
01:46:33.250,01:46:36.458,"Lex, you look after Tim."
01:46:36.500,01:46:40.542,Your hair is all sticking up.
01:46:40.583,01:46:43.625,"Big Tim, the human piece of toast."
01:46:47.417,01:46:49.542,I'll be back soon.
01:47:11.291,01:47:13.709,Ellie!
01:47:16.875,01:47:19.208,- Run.
01:47:21.500,01:47:22.792,Where have you been?
01:48:34.750,01:48:37.917,"It's just the two raptors, right?"
01:48:37.959,01:48:41.542,You sure the third one's contained?
01:48:41.583,01:48:44.375,Unless they figure out how to open doors.
01:49:10.000,01:49:12.041,"Timmy, what is it?"
01:49:12.083,01:49:15.917,It's a Velociraptor.
01:49:15.959,01:49:18.917,It's inside.
01:49:41.000,01:49:43.750,Follow me.
01:52:19.458,01:52:21.917,It's in there.
01:52:21.959,01:52:24.125,Control room.
01:52:28.375,01:52:30.333,We can call for help?
01:52:30.375,01:52:33.667,We gotta reboot the system first.
01:52:35.667,01:52:37.917,The door locks!
01:52:37.959,01:52:40.041,"Ellie, boot up the door locks!"
01:52:43.333,01:52:45.667,God!
01:52:47.583,01:52:51.542,"- No, boot up the door locks!"
01:52:51.583,01:52:54.291,"Ellie, get back!"
01:52:54.333,01:52:56.917,You can't hold it by yourself!
01:53:04.875,01:53:08.625,It's a UNIX system.
01:53:08.667,01:53:12.291,It's all the files of the whole park.
01:53:12.333,01:53:14.375,"Um, I gotta find the right file."
01:53:14.417,01:53:17.083,Try to reach the gun!
01:53:25.250,01:53:27.000,I can't get it unless I move.
01:53:42.375,01:53:44.959,"Oh, this is it."
01:53:45.000,01:53:48.291,Wait. This-- This isn't the right file.
01:53:51.333,01:53:52.291,"Come on, Lex!"
01:54:00.583,01:54:02.083,You got it?
01:54:05.542,01:54:07.625,You got it!
01:54:07.667,01:54:09.667,Yes!
01:54:13.542,01:54:17.834,"Phones, security systems."
01:54:27.250,01:54:31.709,- Grant?
01:54:31.750,01:54:34.917,The children all right?
01:54:34.959,01:54:39.125,Call the mainland.
01:54:39.166,01:54:41.250,come through the glass!
01:54:41.291,01:54:43.750,What?
01:54:43.792,01:54:45.000,Grant!
01:55:33.750,01:55:36.208,Move! Quickly!
01:56:19.000,01:56:22.750,"- Tim, let go. Yeah."
01:56:36.583,01:56:38.667,- Aaah!
01:57:37.583,01:57:40.083,Hold on to me!
01:57:40.125,01:57:43.000,"After careful consideration, I've decided..."
01:57:43.041,01:57:45.875,not to endorse your park.
01:58:15.750,01:58:17.834,It's okay.
01:58:34.125,01:58:36.458,Come on.
01:58:36.500,01:58:38.500,Come on.
