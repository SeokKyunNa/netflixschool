00:01:59.661,00:02:02.831,It was nice yellow with many holes.
00:02:03.581,00:02:05.375,It looked so good.
00:02:06.084,00:02:08.211,I carried it around in my arms.
00:02:10.505,00:02:14.759,Then I saw a girl sitting on the street with her younger sibling on her back.
00:02:15.927,00:02:18.054,I could tell they were starved.
00:02:19.389,00:02:25.311,"Their faces were yellow, and the younger one's body was limp with no energy to cry."
00:02:27.063,00:02:31.359,So I turned away to eat it.
00:02:32.152,00:02:35.613,But I ended up giving it to them.
00:02:37.448,00:02:44.539,"Since I had it in my arms all day, it must have been warm."
00:02:47.167,00:02:48.251,That nice castella.
00:02:49.085,00:02:53.089,It'd be the last one I could ever have in my life.
00:02:57.427,00:02:59.053,They were devouring it.
00:03:00.054,00:03:02.348,She was shoving it in the younger one's mouth.
00:03:03.850,00:03:07.312,Would God remember that?
00:03:07.395,00:03:09.105,It was 30 years ago.
00:03:12.108,00:03:13.151,For sure.
00:03:14.027,00:03:15.528,That's His specialty.
00:03:16.863,00:03:17.989,Right.
00:03:18.740,00:03:22.410,Remember you played the pipe for me?
00:03:23.453,00:03:27.123,Can you play that one more time?
00:03:50.146,00:03:51.898,You know how to do cardiac massage?
00:03:55.443,00:03:56.319,Do it.
00:03:58.863,00:03:59.781,Stop.
00:04:03.326,00:04:04.160,Again.
00:04:16.422,00:04:17.382,Two hundred joules.
00:04:29.894,00:04:30.728,Charge.
00:04:34.190,00:04:40.280,The ones who want to connect with God tend to have self-hatred and unknowingly seek for misfortune.
00:04:40.363,00:04:42.615,They're quite vulnerable to demons.
00:04:42.699,00:04:45.910,"Just like Saint Bruno said, suicide is to die a martyr for Satan."
00:04:47.036,00:04:49.747,It's the worst sin among murders.
00:04:50.665,00:04:52.792,It's like a life sentence in hell.
00:04:55.670,00:04:59.716,"Say 20 Hail Marys, get plenty of sunlight, and take a cold shower."
00:04:59.799,00:05:02.385,Take God's gift of science.
00:05:03.636,00:05:06.097,Talk to a psychiatrist and take antidepressants.
00:05:08.433,00:05:10.810,Please stop thinking of suicide.
00:05:12.020,00:05:14.063,"And forget about him, he's gone. Please."
00:05:21.446,00:05:22.322,Father.
00:05:23.865,00:05:26.784,I'll take care of my relationships and other businesses.
00:05:28.369,00:05:30.330,You just sit there and pray for me.
00:05:31.581,00:05:35.335,"Could you ask the bishop to send me to Emmanuel labs, please?"
00:05:38.212,00:05:41.758,I heard it's not approved by the Vatican.
00:05:43.301,00:05:45.428,Sarah died on Monday.
00:05:45.511,00:05:47.388,She had surgery eight times.
00:05:48.056,00:05:50.266,Hyo-seong's been in a coma since yesterday.
00:05:52.018,00:05:55.229,It's painful to see people die like this.
00:05:55.897,00:06:00.777,No one knows what's going on in that laboratory.
00:06:02.820,00:06:05.114,I want to save people.
00:06:05.198,00:06:06.699,My gosh.
00:06:07.658,00:06:10.578,I told you to go to medical school since you were young.
00:06:11.120,00:06:14.332,It would've been great to check my eyes if you became an ophthalmologist.
00:06:14.415,00:06:15.500,Father.
00:06:15.583,00:06:17.835,-Can I go to Emmanuel Lab-- -Hey.
00:06:17.919,00:06:20.046,Let's stop chatting and give the formula of absolution.
00:06:23.549,00:06:26.260,I told you to do your confessions.
00:06:29.847,00:06:33.142,"Hello, I'm sorry to leave all of you without a proper goodbye."
00:06:34.560,00:06:37.105,It was such a last minute vacation.
00:06:39.107,00:06:44.070,"I packed everything I could, but everyone says I won't need a thing."
00:06:44.153,00:06:46.406,Because the hotel provided by the church is so nice.
00:06:48.074,00:06:50.618,I'm happy I became a priest in times like this.
00:09:04.001,00:09:07.755,"In your name, I pray that Jesus Christ will allow me the following."
00:09:09.131,00:09:12.385,"Like a leper rotting in the flesh, let all avoid me."
00:09:13.636,00:09:17.723,"Like a cripple with no limbs, let me not move freely."
00:09:19.976,00:09:23.312,Remove my cheeks that tears may not roll down them.
00:09:24.355,00:09:28.693,Crush my lips and tongue so that these don't commit sin.
00:09:28.776,00:09:32.321,Pull out all of my nails so that I may be unable to grab even the tinniest things.
00:09:32.405,00:09:36.033,Let my shoulders and back be crooked so that I cannot lift anything.
00:09:38.494,00:09:42.248,Do not let me think straight as if I'm a patient with brain tumor.
00:09:43.749,00:09:47.837,Put my body part that has been kept pure to shame so that it would not be proud.
00:09:47.920,00:09:49.839,Let me stay in humiliation.
00:09:51.173,00:09:53.301,Don't let anyone pray for me.
00:09:53.384,00:09:57.597,May only Jesus Christ's mercy have pity on me.
00:10:06.856,00:10:08.316,It has already been a month.
00:10:09.191,00:10:13.821,The scenary out the window is so phenominal and it let me forget about TV.
00:10:16.115,00:10:19.910,The hotel owner gave me a room with a view and told me I was handsome.
00:10:21.454,00:10:24.749,"Thanks to her, my skin got so tan and it's even peeling..."
00:11:56.215,00:11:58.801,"Time of death, 3:31 p.m."
00:12:11.564,00:12:15.484,"In your name, I pray that Jesus Christ will allow me the following."
00:12:17.027,00:12:20.281,"Like a leper rotting in the flesh, let all avoid me."
00:12:21.574,00:12:22.867,Like a cripple with no limbs...
00:12:22.950,00:12:24.910,"Look, look at his skin."
00:12:44.388,00:12:46.432,"Father, please hold my hand."
00:12:46.515,00:12:48.350,Please pray for me.
00:12:50.478,00:12:54.732,"Father, my five-year-old girl has leukemia."
00:12:54.815,00:13:20.257,PLEASE PRAY FOR US You're saying people come to us to beg for a prayer from the bandaged man.
00:13:20.925,00:13:23.093,What a rumor.
00:13:28.891,00:13:31.268,I heard there were some who got healed.
00:13:33.145,00:13:35.815,It could be psychologica.
00:13:37.107,00:13:40.736,Since you're the only one survived out of 50 applicants.
00:13:43.447,00:13:44.490,Isn't that so?
00:13:49.912,00:13:52.081,-You're lucky! -You're lucky!
00:13:52.164,00:13:53.874,I envy you.
00:13:53.958,00:13:55.209,Look at him.
00:14:07.763,00:14:10.808,Are you the only survivor out of 500?
00:14:11.851,00:14:15.020,My kid has cancer!
00:14:16.105,00:14:18.232,Would you pray for him?
00:14:20.609,00:14:22.611,It's just a psychological effect.
00:14:22.695,00:14:24.738,I can't do anything.
00:14:28.909,00:14:30.286,Channel nine isn't working.
00:14:30.369,00:14:31.579,"Let's pray, son."
00:14:35.040,00:14:35.875,What?
00:14:37.751,00:14:41.505,"By any chance, didn't you live in Busan?"
00:14:44.341,00:14:48.596,We're gathered here praying for Gang-u Lee.
00:14:50.472,00:14:52.641,He was born out of Your love.
00:14:53.934,00:15:00.566,He has a soft-heart where he can't even pass by a wounded animal on the street.
00:15:01.483,00:15:03.652,Please have mercy on him.
00:15:04.862,00:15:07.865,I pray in Jesus' name.
00:15:07.948,00:15:08.866,-Amen. -Amen.
00:15:11.285,00:15:12.536,Come on.
00:15:13.621,00:15:18.083,"I don't believe in this stuff but since you're my friend, I let you do it."
00:15:23.047,00:15:25.007,"Hey, now I think I recognize you."
00:15:25.591,00:15:27.259,"I'm sorry, you're still a priest."
00:15:30.137,00:15:31.764,"I'm sorry, Father."
00:15:35.142,00:15:38.354,You used to come over for noodles.
00:15:38.437,00:15:39.688,"Fifth grade, right?"
00:15:40.439,00:15:42.524,"You lived at the church orphanage, right?"
00:15:43.943,00:15:48.280,My son was so kind-hearted that he was so good to the orphans too.
00:15:48.864,00:15:49.865,Wasn't he?
00:15:49.949,00:15:53.077,Your sister was so shy and ran out whenever I came over.
00:15:54.828,00:15:59.541,She had calluses on her feet and Gang-u made me touch them.
00:16:04.171,00:16:07.383,Her parents rented a small room in our house.
00:16:09.343,00:16:12.596,Her father was a high school drop out.
00:16:13.180,00:16:17.977,This is my blood shed for you so that sins may be forgiven.
00:16:18.477,00:16:23.524,"One snowy spring day, they left her in my room and said they'd be back soon."
00:16:24.608,00:16:25.859,But they never came back.
00:16:26.360,00:16:32.866,HAPPY CLASSIC BOUTIQUE So I took the three-year-old in and raised her like a daughter and a puppy.
00:16:33.409,00:16:35.285,She'd call me Mommy too.
00:16:35.369,00:16:37.913,HAPPY HANBOK I'm her mommy-in-law now.
00:16:41.709,00:16:43.669,Marriage is no big deal.
00:16:44.461,00:16:47.965,She just moved from sleeping in my bed to Gang-u's.
00:16:51.218,00:16:55.806,"Why'd you buy the laver at that place again, Mom?"
00:16:57.349,00:17:04.648,I told you it's no good and the owner is a cocksucker.
00:17:36.180,00:17:37.306,You hate it that much?
00:17:38.348,00:17:39.433,"No, it's not that."
00:17:40.059,00:17:41.769,I'm sensitive to smell these days.
00:17:42.728,00:17:45.105,I suddenly got a whiff of blood.
00:17:49.985,00:17:51.028,Gang-u's home.
00:17:52.529,00:17:54.531,"-Mom, I think I caught a cold. -What?"
00:17:54.615,00:17:55.991,"Sang-hyeon, you came early."
00:17:56.075,00:17:58.118,I told you to wear your long johns.
00:17:58.202,00:18:00.621,"-We're here, too. -Welcome."
00:18:00.704,00:18:01.872,How are you?
00:18:01.955,00:18:03.457,My friend the priest.
00:18:03.540,00:18:06.335,This is our dam construction manager and his wife.
00:18:06.418,00:18:10.047,"It's an honor, Father. I'm Yeong-du."
00:18:10.130,00:18:12.466,"She's a Filipina, so she's Catholic."
00:18:12.966,00:18:14.635,"Say hello, Evelyn."
00:18:23.310,00:18:24.853,Tae-ju!
00:18:26.063,00:18:27.189,How have you been?
00:18:33.362,00:18:36.532,Here comes the police chief.
00:18:36.615,00:18:39.451,"Please, stop calling me that."
00:18:39.535,00:18:41.703,I quit the force a long time ago.
00:18:43.413,00:18:45.833,He's the security head. This is Father Hyeon.
00:18:45.916,00:18:48.585,-Hello. -Do you like fishing?
00:18:48.669,00:18:53.298,Get on his good side and you can fish there though its banned.
00:18:53.382,00:18:55.926,Daytimes are a bit tricky. Come by at nights.
00:18:56.009,00:18:58.137,"Have a seat, Father."
00:18:58.220,00:18:59.263,"Yes, please."
00:19:03.142,00:19:08.063,Koreans don't appreciate mahjong.
00:19:10.190,00:19:12.985,"Would you like to play, Father?"
00:19:13.485,00:19:14.736,I don't know how to play.
00:19:18.198,00:19:22.077,Did I tell you about Father Hyeon praying for Gang-u?
00:19:24.204,00:19:28.041,I was standing right next to my son.
00:19:28.125,00:19:33.213,"Suddenly, I felt something hot come down on my head."
00:19:33.297,00:19:38.760,I felt tingly all over like someone was poking me with needles.
00:19:38.844,00:19:40.095,Oh my.
00:19:42.556,00:19:47.352,"Then my boy said Mom, it feels hot right here."
00:19:50.981,00:19:53.483,Then the cancer vanished.
00:19:53.567,00:19:54.902,It vanished?
00:19:57.613,00:20:00.282,You always feel tingly because of your blood pressure.
00:20:00.365,00:20:02.826,But I did a biopsy just in case.
00:20:02.910,00:20:03.744,What?
00:20:05.412,00:20:09.666,Your first endoscope showed it was esophagus cancer.
00:20:10.667,00:20:13.712,Women shouldn't get sedated endoscopes.
00:20:13.795,00:20:17.883,Doctors secretly molest them.
00:20:24.723,00:20:25.933,I win.

00:20:37.861,00:20:39.988,Can we turn the heater down?
00:20:40.822,00:20:42.032,But I'm cold.
00:20:42.950,00:20:44.284,Thank you.
00:20:44.368,00:20:45.869,Gang-u says he's cold!
00:20:45.953,00:20:47.079,I'm losing so much.
00:20:47.162,00:20:49.957,Thank you very much.
00:20:51.166,00:20:52.042,Okay.
00:21:16.650,00:21:18.610,What's with me today?
00:21:19.695,00:21:21.655,Instead of the hot water bag.
00:21:54.980,00:21:57.065,I'm going down to get the lights in the store.
00:21:57.149,00:21:59.693,"Okay, let's do it."

00:26:36.886,00:26:38.597,She's still conscious though.
00:26:43.977,00:26:46.104,Let this water call to mind your baptismal sharing.
00:26:46.187,00:26:50.191,In Christ's redeeming passion and resurrection.
00:26:51.735,00:26:52.902,Veronica.

00:31:45.278,00:31:47.697,I woke up and I was at the pharmacy.
00:31:48.197,00:31:50.199,And some man walked past.
00:31:51.117,00:31:53.244,Aren't there pills for sleepwalking?
00:31:54.871,00:31:57.040,I should lock your room from the outside.
00:31:57.540,00:31:59.292,Should've got me pills for my cold.
00:32:01.127,00:32:01.961,Wasn't it cold?
00:32:02.879,00:32:04.339,You never even catch a cold.
00:32:08.009,00:32:09.385,"She's a yeti, Mom."
00:32:19.270,00:32:21.147,Smells like when you had gastritis.
00:32:21.731,00:32:23.524,I'll go find the pills.
00:32:26.569,00:32:28.488,Must you do this to believe me?
00:32:32.742,00:32:35.411,Don't grab my heart so hard.
00:32:52.428,00:32:56.933,I drank Hyo-seong's blood and the blisters disappeared.
00:32:57.892,00:33:00.269,It's as if the vampire cells suppressed the disease.
00:33:02.230,00:33:03.940,But it doesn't last very long.
00:33:06.442,00:33:07.276,Father.
00:33:08.236,00:33:10.905,I didn't choose the blood that was transfused into me.
00:33:12.365,00:33:14.492,You know I went there to do good.
00:33:20.248,00:33:23.042,"Now, I thirst after all sinful pleasures."
00:33:24.127,00:33:27.755,But how can I get human blood without killing?
00:33:28.589,00:33:33.219,"First, the lord said not to worry about what to eat."
00:33:33.845,00:33:35.805,For he feeds even the birds in the sky.
00:33:36.723,00:33:37.557,Here.
00:33:57.493,00:33:58.411,I think I won.
00:33:59.037,00:34:00.246,My goodness.
00:34:00.913,00:34:01.789,Small four winds.
00:34:02.707,00:34:04.709,"Closed, half flush, bonus three points."
00:34:06.210,00:34:08.004,"28,000 won. You lose!"
00:34:11.299,00:34:14.719,Is he from Macao or something?
00:34:15.261,00:34:20.683,He's the only one who survived out of 500.
00:34:20.767,00:34:22.310,"Five hundred, my ass."
00:34:39.577,00:35:01.099,HAPPY CLASSIC BOUTIQUE When did you go out?
00:35:01.974,00:35:03.851,I didn't see you pass by.
00:35:53.151,00:35:56.737,It's a kind of an infectious disease.
00:35:58.573,00:35:59.490,"Scary, isn't it?"
00:36:00.074,00:36:03.411,You look so different without your glasses.
00:36:06.122,00:36:07.498,How can you get infected?
00:36:10.209,00:36:12.503,Not through a kiss for sure.
00:36:13.379,00:36:15.840,I never kissed anyone in my life.
00:36:20.678,00:36:21.554,Until now.
00:36:50.666,00:36:52.877,I don't get shy.
00:36:55.213,00:36:57.131,I didn't run out because I was shy.
00:36:58.549,00:37:04.722,"When I was young, back in Busan, it was because I was sick of everything."
00:37:10.144,00:37:14.523,"The mom, idiot son, and the dark, damp house."
00:37:15.233,00:37:17.860,"The nonstop weepy, old songs."
00:37:25.076,00:37:27.036,I waited for you to come.
00:37:28.079,00:37:36.629,"You were just an orphanage boy, I would look out the window when I was young."
00:37:38.881,00:37:41.008,Because the idiot liked you.
00:37:42.009,00:37:44.095,"When you came, he left me alone."
00:37:52.061,00:37:54.272,I'm not a shy person.
00:38:08.202,00:38:14.125,I run out on my bare feet to escape from this hell sooner.
00:38:23.551,00:38:25.678,I even run out from my sleep.
00:38:26.178,00:38:28.014,They think I'm sleepwalking.
00:38:28.681,00:38:32.643,I feel awake only then and asleep the rest of the time.
00:39:56.060,00:39:57.186,Honey!
00:39:58.729,00:39:59.563,Tae-ju!
00:39:59.647,00:40:01.148,Hot water bag!
00:40:02.400,00:40:03.359,Tae-ju?
00:40:05.486,00:40:06.821,Tae-ju!
00:40:40.020,00:40:41.313,You bitch!
00:40:41.897,00:40:44.066,There she goes again.
00:40:44.150,00:40:46.360,I fed you and raised you!
00:40:46.444,00:40:48.821,-You know that? -Go put her to bed!
00:40:49.780,00:40:52.992,You can't even change your husband's hot water bag?
00:40:53.075,00:40:56.662,How dare you!
00:40:56.745,00:40:57.955,-I win. -What?
00:40:58.038,00:40:59.707,-Let go! -My gosh.
00:41:04.462,00:41:06.088,You have stomach troubles?
00:41:06.714,00:41:08.132,What took you so long?
00:41:08.215,00:41:10.885,Eat up other's money and you'll get diarrhea.
00:41:20.895,00:41:21.896,What's got into you?
00:41:23.647,00:41:25.232,This looks fun.
00:41:26.484,00:41:28.235,So exciting to touch.
00:41:30.821,00:41:32.656,"I could do it all night, too."
00:41:32.740,00:41:34.492,You don't even know how to do it.
00:41:35.701,00:41:36.535,Me?
00:41:37.786,00:41:39.163,I know how to do it.
00:41:40.539,00:41:41.665,I'm good.
00:41:44.251,00:41:47.046,They are on fire.
00:41:49.507,00:41:51.217,I can't wait till next Wednesday.
00:41:51.300,00:41:53.344,"Then how about Sundays, too?"
00:41:55.137,00:41:56.138,Why not?
00:41:57.306,00:41:58.224,Well...
00:42:00.601,00:42:03.145,It's Easter Sunday. I'm staying at the hospital.
00:42:04.396,00:42:07.024,It's best to leave things in wanting.
00:42:09.401,00:42:11.320,-Mom. -Yeah.
00:42:13.280,00:42:14.406,You know.
00:42:14.490,00:42:15.324,Yeah?
00:42:16.534,00:42:18.786,I don't want to live like this anymore.
00:42:20.663,00:42:21.789,I...
00:42:23.916,00:42:27.127,want to help the needy.
00:42:31.131,00:42:34.593,Maybe I can volunteer at a hospital or something.
00:42:38.013,00:42:38.931,On Sundays.
00:43:26.687,00:43:27.896,Thanks for coming.
00:43:29.523,00:43:30.858,Don't ever come again.
00:43:32.318,00:43:34.820,But I came to help the needy.
00:43:37.948,00:43:41.327,Its a bigger sin for a priest.
00:43:42.286,00:43:44.330,I'm not even Catholic.
00:43:45.873,00:43:48.459,"To me, you're just a needy, single man."
00:43:49.460,00:43:53.380,We can both go to hell for this.
00:43:54.048,00:43:56.467,I don't have faith. I'm not going to hell.
00:44:01.930,00:44:02.890,But...
00:44:06.101,00:44:08.395,I have a terrible disease.
00:44:08.479,00:44:11.398,I'm too damn healthy.
00:44:12.608,00:44:14.985,"Just once, I wish I could be sick in bed."
00:44:42.388,00:44:43.347,It's okay.
00:44:45.099,00:44:48.936,"Hyo-seong is a nice guy, but he's in a coma."
00:44:50.729,00:44:54.817,"Unless his vitals drop, no one will come in here at nights."
00:46:39.546,00:46:42.090,"Sorry, I hurt you."
00:46:45.761,00:46:49.139,"No, its good."
00:46:50.724,00:46:52.434,"It's strange, but good."
00:46:56.271,00:46:57.940,Is it supposed to feel this good?
00:47:35.185,00:47:36.645,What's wrong with me?
00:47:39.606,00:47:41.358,Are other women like this?
00:47:43.986,00:47:45.320,Am I a pervert?
00:51:26.166,00:51:27.542,Did you eat?
00:51:28.460,00:51:30.337,"Oh, yes."
00:51:32.589,00:51:35.342,Can we meet during the day next week?
00:51:36.718,00:51:38.178,Daytimes are a bit difficult.
00:51:39.763,00:51:41.389,We could be together longer.
00:51:45.393,00:51:48.313,I don't want to keep my disease a secret from you.
00:51:50.190,00:51:51.441,I am...
00:51:54.277,00:51:57.531,a kind of a...
00:52:47.038,00:52:49.499,"I don't kill anyone, you know."
00:52:50.333,00:52:55.297,"About Hyo-seong, he loved helping the hungry."
00:52:56.798,00:52:59.843,"He'd offer me his blood, if he wasn't in a coma."
00:53:01.261,00:53:04.347,If you only heard the sponge cake story.
00:53:06.725,00:53:09.394,No one blames someone for getting hurt in an accident.
00:53:10.353,00:53:12.480,No one gets criticized for having cancer.
00:53:16.318,00:53:18.486,I went there to do good!
00:53:27.621,00:53:29.331,So what if I'm a vampire?
00:53:31.458,00:53:34.419,"Tae-ju, did you like me because I'm a priest?"
00:53:35.503,00:53:38.548,"Its not that, is it? That's just my job."
00:53:38.632,00:53:45.805,Being a vampire is like having different palates or different life patterns.
00:53:45.889,00:53:46.848,Don't you think?
00:53:47.766,00:53:50.602,"When two people are in love, does it really matter?"
00:53:51.978,00:53:53.647,"No, what I mean is..."
00:53:55.774,00:53:57.234,You hate that I'm a vampire?
00:53:58.068,00:54:00.737,Think I could've slept with you if I wasn't?
00:54:01.238,00:54:03.281,How could I have sex with you?
00:54:03.990,00:54:05.533,As just a priest?
00:54:08.995,00:54:10.330,Come with me.
00:54:10.413,00:54:12.249,I'll take you away from this hell.
00:54:16.211,00:54:19.047,You liked doing it with me. Gang-u's no fun.
00:54:25.679,00:54:26.596,Tae-ju?
00:54:35.063,00:54:36.106,What's going on?
00:54:39.526,00:54:41.403,The toilet's not flushing.
00:54:54.457,00:54:55.834,It's going down now.
00:55:14.352,00:55:15.228,Closing time.
00:56:06.029,00:56:06.863,Hello?
00:56:07.364,00:56:11.993,How can someone become a vampire?
00:56:14.913,00:56:17.165,Can you catch it through sex?
00:56:22.962,00:56:25.131,Can you turn me into one?
00:57:07.424,00:57:12.095,Vampires are cuter than I thought.
00:57:19.769,00:57:20.979,Can you bend this?
00:57:22.230,00:57:23.565,What for?
00:57:43.751,00:57:45.253,Can you jump down from here?
00:57:57.056,00:57:58.683,Is it too high?
00:58:37.013,00:58:38.264,I'm ready.
00:59:25.645,00:59:26.854,Did Gang-u do that?
00:59:29.315,00:59:30.483,Does he hurt you often?
00:59:34.320,00:59:36.030,Not often.
00:59:37.615,00:59:41.869,Want me to rip him up like that coin?
00:59:54.007,00:59:59.220,I lived as their dog my whole life.
01:00:00.805,01:00:06.352,"Feeding the idiot, washing him, and even helping him masturbate."
01:00:08.271,01:00:09.397,You know.
01:00:10.982,01:00:13.151,I'm practically a virgin.
01:00:15.194,01:00:16.029,He's...
01:00:17.572,01:00:18.406,Does it hurt?
01:00:19.198,01:00:20.074,"It hurts, right?"
01:00:30.293,01:00:33.796,Can't you volunteer somewhere else?
01:00:34.964,01:00:36.799,Mental hospitals are so scary.
01:00:37.800,01:00:38.676,Isn't it?
01:00:45.808,01:00:46.643,Drink it.
01:00:53.441,01:00:58.321,Can't you go back to the lab to find out the cause?
01:00:59.572,01:01:01.282,Ask if there's any way for a cure?
01:01:02.659,01:01:05.870,Sunlight is bound to hit me on my way there.
01:01:07.372,01:01:08.373,Sunlight.
01:01:10.500,01:01:15.213,I wish I can see the sunrise over the sea before I die.
01:01:17.465,01:01:19.842,What are you thinking?
01:01:21.219,01:01:23.596,Vampires can't see the sunlight.
01:01:24.597,01:01:26.808,I don't care if it's at night.
01:01:27.975,01:01:33.314,"The moon, the stars, and even a firefly."
01:01:35.024,01:01:36.401,I don't care you're a vampire.
01:01:36.901,01:01:39.320,Make the blind see.
01:01:41.948,01:01:43.700,Please give me some of your blood.
01:01:44.200,01:01:46.703,"It even killed the disease, EV!"
01:01:47.412,01:01:49.831,"Please, Sang-hyeon."
01:01:49.914,01:01:51.249,I said I'm okay with it.
01:01:52.291,01:01:53.501,Sang-hyeon.
01:01:54.335,01:01:55.503,Father Hyeon.
01:01:56.546,01:01:58.464,It's really fine.
01:01:59.340,01:02:01.551,"Just a little bit, please?"
01:02:04.137,01:02:06.848,I'm no longer a priest nor a friar.
01:02:09.183,01:02:11.894,Forget the rules. Forget the Vatican.
01:02:13.020,01:02:14.480,It's none of my business now.
01:02:24.157,01:02:27.493,I don't know why you wandered astray.
01:02:28.995,01:02:32.749,But I know you'll get through this.
01:02:34.375,01:02:38.838,I took pity on you when you were young.
01:02:40.423,01:02:43.468,We had you over for noodles.
01:02:45.219,01:02:48.222,You can stay here as long as you want.
01:02:48.306,01:02:49.515,You understand?
01:02:50.600,01:02:51.476,Thank you.
01:02:55.772,01:02:57.356,Tae-ju...
01:02:59.442,01:03:04.697,"She could act cold, but she's really warm-hearted."
01:03:06.282,01:03:12.497,I'm giving the shop and everything to her.
01:03:15.875,01:03:17.919,Did I do it too hard?
01:03:23.382,01:03:24.592,It's perfect.
01:03:29.388,01:03:30.890,"One more time, then?"
01:03:59.168,01:04:00.795,Good night.
01:04:00.878,01:04:02.338,Sweet dreams.
01:05:21.208,01:05:22.293,Hurry and get out.
01:05:25.004,01:05:26.088,Hurry.
01:05:27.715,01:05:28.674,Go.
01:05:30.301,01:05:31.510,Someone will see you.
01:05:40.269,01:05:41.270,No. Don't.
01:06:27.650,01:06:29.193,Remember Tae-ju when she was young?
01:06:30.945,01:06:32.321,Wasn't she cute?
01:06:33.531,01:06:38.536,"When she was twelve, she woke me up and showed me her panties."
01:06:39.537,01:06:40.746,Said she peed blood.
01:06:42.873,01:06:46.252,She said she'd die because she took too many weird pills.
01:06:47.962,01:06:50.172,We hugged each other and cried all night.
01:06:53.759,01:06:54.969,What are we waiting for?
01:06:56.303,01:06:58.639,-Planning on taking all night? -What?
01:07:01.517,01:07:02.518,It's only 9:00 p.m.
01:07:03.352,01:07:07.606,The hospital and police questioning will take hours.
01:07:09.191,01:07:11.068,What if the sun comes up?
01:07:25.666,01:07:27.293,"I said, no!"
01:07:28.502,01:07:30.004,Just a little bit?
01:07:31.922,01:07:34.216,They'll find out with an autopsy.
01:07:35.760,01:07:38.054,I thought about it a lot.
01:07:38.596,01:07:40.264,Why go somewhere else for blood?
01:07:40.931,01:07:42.850,We have blood right here.
01:07:45.102,01:07:46.353,Put the knife down.
01:07:47.646,01:07:48.939,"Yeah, put it down."
01:07:53.736,01:07:55.696,No! Don't come near me!
01:08:45.329,01:08:47.706,Tae-ju!
01:09:32.835,01:09:36.130,"We have an injured, unconscious female here."
01:09:36.213,01:09:38.299,We'll be going soon. Please prepare.
01:09:38.382,01:09:40.009,"-Check it out quick! -Yes, sir!"
01:09:40.092,01:09:41.719,How did that go?
01:09:42.386,01:09:45.222,It's just not possible because it's too dark right now.
01:09:55.232,01:10:00.905,Don't mention that I let you fish here.
01:10:02.156,01:10:04.700,I'll take care of everything.
01:10:21.634,01:10:23.886,Father Hyeon is here.
01:10:31.018,01:10:33.979,He became ill again for our sins.
01:10:36.899,01:10:42.655,Grant me the following in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
01:10:43.489,01:10:47.993,"Like a leper rotting in the flesh, let all avoid me."
01:10:48.619,01:10:54.583,"Like a cripple with no limbs, let me not move freely."
01:10:55.251,01:10:59.797,Remove my cheeks that tears may not roll down them.
01:11:02.466,01:11:04.551,There was a house at the bottom of the lake.
01:11:05.052,01:11:06.595,A submerged village.
01:11:07.846,01:11:10.516,I thought he was drown and dead.
01:11:11.684,01:11:15.229,"But when I went up, he'd float up again and again."
01:11:16.355,01:11:20.609,So I put him in a closet in the house and a big rock on his chest.
01:11:22.945,01:11:25.322,What if he comes out and chases me?
01:11:27.408,01:11:30.869,"I should've put a rock at the closet door, too."
01:11:32.246,01:11:34.248,"Death is the end. Right, Father?"
01:11:35.749,01:11:36.875,You die and that's it?
01:11:51.557,01:11:52.641,See?
01:11:54.727,01:11:57.021,Vampires are not immortal.
01:11:59.231,01:12:00.816,You still want my blood?
01:12:04.111,01:12:07.948,You want to see this dark world that badly?
01:12:10.242,01:12:15.581,You live on other's blood but won't give me a drop of yours.
01:12:21.420,01:12:23.922,Give me absolution and I'll give it to you.
01:12:31.847,01:12:38.312,"Merciful Father, You saved the world through the death and resurrection of the Son."
01:12:39.021,01:12:42.107,And sent the Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins.
01:12:43.025,01:12:46.820,"Through the ministry of the Church, may God give you pardon and peace."
01:12:47.571,01:12:53.160,"And I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
01:12:53.243,01:12:54.161,Amen.
01:12:55.245,01:12:57.498,Let us praise the Lord.
01:13:02.169,01:13:05.214,The Lord's mercy endures forever.
01:13:08.133,01:13:12.054,The Lord has forgiven your sins.
01:14:41.977,01:14:44.730,"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."
01:14:45.981,01:14:46.899,Amen.
01:14:50.694,01:14:52.404,I pray to Tae-ju.
01:14:52.488,01:14:57.159,"Tae-ju, please wake up and listen to my prayer."
01:14:59.995,01:15:06.752,"I said Gang-u was drunk from a bottle of soju, so say the same to the cops."
01:15:07.753,01:15:10.672,"When this is all over, we will be together."
01:15:10.756,01:15:13.425,We must not meet for a while.
01:15:15.844,01:15:22.059,"Though my face may seem cold and rigid, my heart only beats for you."
01:15:23.685,01:15:28.941,"When we meet again, I believe we'll finally be happy."
01:15:31.443,01:15:32.319,Father Hyeon.
01:15:33.237,01:15:39.535,"Doing it this way, I feel like I am not dying but living inside you."
01:16:24.746,01:16:26.915,-Stop all the... -Thinking.
01:16:27.749,01:16:33.714,The police needs the body to close the case.
01:16:35.632,01:16:36.883,Mrs. Ra.
01:16:36.967,01:16:39.553,Gang-u couldn't swim.
01:16:39.636,01:16:42.931,You need to move on with your life.
01:16:44.182,01:16:45.559,Gang-u can swim.
01:16:53.400,01:16:55.652,Father Hyeon's still not taking calls?
01:16:56.278,01:16:58.238,It must've been a big shock.
01:17:02.034,01:17:04.161,"Still, he could've come to the funeral."
01:17:11.376,01:17:12.419,Gang-u!
01:17:13.754,01:17:14.588,Gang-u!
01:17:19.217,01:17:20.761,"I'm Sang-hyeon, ma'am."
01:17:21.261,01:17:22.679,I know I'm all wet.
01:17:22.763,01:17:24.306,My poor baby.
01:17:25.140,01:17:26.642,What took you so long?
01:17:26.725,01:17:28.644,Why didn't you call?
01:17:29.603,01:17:31.229,Bastard! You son of a bitch!
01:17:31.313,01:17:32.606,You bastard!
01:17:34.483,01:17:36.735,-Oh my! -Mrs. Ra!
01:17:36.818,01:17:39.029,"-Wake up, Mrs. Ra! -Bring some water!"
01:17:39.112,01:17:40.614,My goodness.
01:17:41.323,01:17:44.493,"Mrs. Ra, drink this."
01:17:48.580,01:17:52.584,This is why we should all watch our blood pressures.
01:17:53.585,01:17:54.920,Watch our drinking.
01:17:55.671,01:17:57.339,And stay away from salty foods.
01:17:59.883,01:18:04.346,"Let's give Mrs. Ra our positive energy, oasis-style."
01:18:04.429,01:18:06.765,We should cheer her up.
01:18:07.557,01:18:09.768,Starting with Tae-ju.
01:18:12.771,01:18:13.605,Mom.
01:18:14.481,01:18:17.734,How long has it been?
01:19:00.777,01:19:01.903,Why are you so wet?
01:19:02.738,01:19:03.572,What?
01:19:07.242,01:19:08.201,Is there a leak?
01:19:11.371,01:19:12.873,Why is it so damp?
01:19:18.128,01:19:20.547,Come here and don't bother.
01:19:27.637,01:19:29.806,It's all psychological.
01:19:32.309,01:19:34.603,Stop making a fuss and will you come here?
01:20:30.742,01:20:31.952,"Was he here, too?"
01:20:37.499,01:20:38.375,He? Who?
01:21:57.621,01:21:58.538,Don't fall for it.
01:21:59.414,01:22:01.041,It's all just an illusion.
01:22:01.124,01:22:02.626,Of course.
01:22:02.709,01:22:04.336,It's just psychological.
01:23:04.270,01:23:05.105,Are you leaving?
01:23:09.150,01:23:14.239,"How can someone do it five times, straight?"
01:24:06.416,01:24:10.003,Mom never once threw me a birthday party.
01:24:19.095,01:24:19.929,How dare you.
01:24:38.114,01:24:41.910,But she always gave me plenty to eat.
01:24:44.204,01:24:45.413,Then thank her.
01:24:48.208,01:24:49.167,Thank you.
01:24:54.547,01:24:55.715,You know.
01:24:56.216,01:24:58.551,Can't you go see that detective?
01:24:59.094,01:25:00.428,Aren't you thirsty these days?
01:25:05.850,01:25:08.061,I'll throw you a birthday party this year.
01:25:11.356,01:25:14.484,Really? The first birthday party in my life?
01:25:16.402,01:25:21.282,But I don't know when my birthday is.
01:25:35.630,01:25:37.549,But who made you boss?
01:25:38.550,01:25:40.885,Telling me this and that and hitting me around.
01:25:42.804,01:25:45.765,Gang-u never laid a hand on me.
01:26:32.187,01:26:36.232,Did Gang-u beat you or not?
01:26:37.817,01:26:39.611,Why does that matter?
01:26:41.571,01:26:43.323,That's why he died.
01:26:44.073,01:26:45.742,Don't make excuses.
01:26:46.576,01:26:48.494,You would've killed him anyway.
01:26:49.329,01:26:52.707,So you can have me for yourself.
01:26:52.790,01:26:56.544,Do you know how hard I tried not to kill people?
01:26:59.756,01:27:01.633,You can't even begin to imagine.
01:27:04.093,01:27:07.055,A bloodthirsty beast is growling inside me.
01:27:08.389,01:27:11.226,"But I tiptoed around, afraid I might hurt anyone."
01:27:14.562,01:27:16.022,I killed him because of you.
01:27:19.234,01:27:20.276,To save you.
01:27:23.780,01:27:25.073,To save me?
01:27:28.910,01:27:30.912,Then why am I living a nightmare?
01:27:32.914,01:27:39.879,I stay up trembling at the thought of your cold hand touching me.
01:27:40.713,01:27:41.798,How did this happen?
01:27:49.806,01:27:50.974,Mom.
01:27:53.935,01:27:54.894,Mom.
01:27:55.979,01:27:57.772,I'm done for.
01:27:57.855,01:27:59.774,He's going to kill me.
01:28:00.441,01:28:02.068,Poor Gang-u.
01:28:02.860,01:28:05.947,"No, you're the poorest, Mom."
01:28:07.073,01:28:11.202,You treated that devil like a son and this is what you get?
01:28:13.121,01:28:14.289,Did I do it alone?
01:28:15.832,01:28:17.542,-It was-- -Your idea.
01:28:23.464,01:28:26.342,"No, it was his idea."
01:28:26.426,01:28:28.553,He said he'll kill the mother and the son.
01:28:29.721,01:28:31.014,I'm not lying!
01:29:04.297,01:29:07.675,I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
01:29:09.469,01:29:12.555,We were a happy family of three till you infested us.
01:29:13.097,01:29:14.349,You're a germ!
01:29:20.188,01:29:23.316,"You said I was cute, you cunt."
01:29:35.620,01:29:37.622,Mommy.
01:29:38.998,01:29:40.375,Wake up.
01:29:41.959,01:29:43.628,You can't die like this.
01:29:45.380,01:29:46.255,Mommy.
01:29:50.093,01:29:52.804,Tell me you forgive me.
01:29:53.763,01:29:56.224,"Mom, look at me."
01:29:56.766,01:30:00.978,"If you forgive me, blink once."
01:30:01.062,01:30:03.439,Just one blink? Please?
01:30:06.484,01:30:07.568,Just once?
01:30:08.361,01:30:10.154,"Just once, please?"
01:30:19.747,01:30:21.040,Let's go.
01:30:21.124,01:30:23.918,"That devil will suck all the blood out of you, too!"
01:30:29.048,01:30:30.091,Let go!
01:30:32.343,01:30:33.511,Let go!
01:30:40.226,01:30:41.519,Stay back!
01:30:41.602,01:30:42.728,You devil!
01:30:52.071,01:30:53.573,I want to go to Gang-u.
01:30:54.323,01:30:55.867,"Kill me, please."
01:30:55.950,01:30:57.452,You want to go?
01:31:00.705,01:31:02.415,Go to your husband?
01:31:09.130,01:31:10.006,Really?
01:35:52.830,01:35:54.749,"Happy birthday, Tae-ju."
01:36:00.796,01:36:02.339,Make it completely white.
01:36:03.549,01:36:04.800,Just like daylight.
01:37:12.117,01:37:14.453,That's a good girl.
01:37:14.537,01:37:16.247,Well done.
01:37:16.956,01:37:22.795,"From now on, we wear shoes inside the house like in the States."
01:37:23.295,01:37:24.964,Because I'm in charge now.
01:37:26.757,01:37:30.302,"You have to sleep during the day, too."
01:37:31.136,01:37:32.471,And eat at night...
01:37:35.182,01:37:36.141,Did you just move?
01:37:44.900,01:37:46.944,Watch TV while I'm out.
01:37:51.031,01:37:52.867,A scary movie is going to be on.
01:40:04.832,01:40:06.291,I'm not ashamed at all!
01:40:08.002,01:40:10.671,I told you I'll get the blood.
01:40:11.296,01:40:12.548,Stealing from the hospital?
01:40:12.631,01:40:14.550,-There's more. -What?
01:40:14.633,01:40:16.844,I'm helping people who want to commit suicide.
01:40:16.927,01:40:19.722,I know many people like that from listening to confessions.
01:40:20.514,01:40:23.434,"If I run out, I'll find more through the internet."
01:40:24.810,01:40:30.566,They face death more peacefully if I help them.
01:40:35.362,01:40:37.698,"If they just give it to you, what fun is that?"
01:40:47.374,01:40:49.084,It tastes much better this way.
01:40:49.835,01:40:51.670,How many has to die for your taste?
01:40:52.755,01:40:58.052,"Maybe around 500? How's that, Father?"
01:40:58.969,01:41:00.846,I told you I'm not a priest anymore!
01:41:01.430,01:41:04.808,"Oh dear, Father is mad."
01:41:06.185,01:41:07.811,Stop acting so humane.
01:41:07.895,01:41:09.688,You're not even human.
01:41:11.857,01:41:12.858,Then what are we?
01:41:12.941,01:41:15.110,We're human-eating beasts.
01:41:22.576,01:41:24.536,Is it a sin for a fox to eat a chicken?
01:41:50.104,01:41:52.481,Don't make me regret saving you.
01:41:53.857,01:41:58.362,"Kill me or save me, you'll regret either way."
01:41:59.113,01:42:00.697,Let's break up now.
01:42:12.000,01:42:17.464,You drop me like that because I wanted to break up?
01:42:27.057,01:42:29.434,You're the only one I've got now.
01:42:30.477,01:42:34.273,"HAPPY HANBOK Hey, come out quick."
01:42:46.869,01:42:48.912,"Hey, come out quick."
01:43:42.049,01:43:45.510,You said women are safe from EV.
01:43:46.011,01:43:50.682,Your blood is completely mixed with mine.
01:43:51.516,01:43:55.687,"Then, I'm no longer a woman?"
01:44:07.074,01:44:08.158,Hang in there.
01:44:13.038,01:44:14.081,I'll get a doctor.
01:44:51.994,01:44:52.911,Hello.
01:44:56.248,01:45:27.654,Hello-- Tae-ju.
01:45:29.823,01:45:31.241,What day is it today?
01:45:40.751,01:45:43.795,The eyes are so telling.
01:45:43.879,01:45:48.300,They can express everything between yes and no.
01:45:48.383,01:45:51.386,How do you communicate with just a yes and a no?
01:45:52.471,01:45:55.390,You need a subject and verb to communicate.
01:45:58.268,01:46:02.147,The subject is what's being stared at.
01:46:03.148,01:46:10.238,"If you stare at something for over four seconds, others will automatically turn to look, too."
01:46:10.989,01:46:12.449,Is that a published study?
01:46:14.743,01:46:16.203,I haven't had the chance to yet.
01:46:17.913,01:46:21.833,I'm an expert at reading the eyes after two years of marriage.
01:46:23.418,01:46:24.961,That's why her Korean's not improving.
01:46:25.045,01:46:27.714,Can you tell what Mom's saying?
01:46:27.798,01:46:29.508,That's what I'm talking about.
01:46:30.092,01:46:33.637,Tae-ju just saw me peek over at Mrs. Ra.
01:46:34.346,01:46:38.558,"She knew what I was going to say, before I said it."
01:46:39.184,01:46:40.811,By glancing at my eyes.
01:46:43.105,01:46:48.026,Mrs. Ra said I'd win if I took this piece.
01:46:48.735,01:46:51.238,And that she wants some vodka.
01:46:51.780,01:46:52.614,Vodka.
01:46:55.367,01:46:56.243,I win.
01:46:57.327,01:47:00.163,"Closed, self-draw, bonus three points, big three dragons."
01:47:01.998,01:47:03.792,See that?
01:47:05.252,01:47:07.921,"Thank you, Mrs. Ra."
01:47:10.298,01:47:12.342,You want to play that bad?
01:47:14.553,01:47:15.554,"Oh, right."
01:47:15.637,01:47:17.973,How about teaming her up with Evelyn?
01:47:19.057,01:47:23.228,"If you blink, it means yes."
01:47:23.937,01:47:26.857,A long blink means no.
01:47:27.732,01:47:28.859,Okay?
01:47:28.942,01:47:31.778,Blink if you understand.
01:47:43.623,01:47:44.624,Throw it away.
01:47:45.375,01:47:46.918,Mrs. Ra is back.
01:47:47.586,01:47:49.880,Evelyn? Vodka.
01:48:07.481,01:48:08.315,D.
01:48:09.274,01:48:10.108,D?
01:48:11.276,01:48:12.402,"D, what?"
01:48:13.236,01:48:14.946,Is she moving her finger?
01:48:16.364,01:48:17.741,What's wrong with her nail?
01:48:18.783,01:48:20.368,Wait.
01:48:20.452,01:48:21.286,L.
01:48:22.329,01:48:24.247,"-L? -L, it's another letter."
01:48:24.331,01:48:26.458,-What? -What is it?
01:48:26.541,01:48:27.375,What?
01:48:28.919,01:48:30.003,"L, D."
01:48:30.921,01:48:31.755,"Or D, L?"
01:48:32.255,01:48:34.549,"D comes last, L, D."
01:48:35.050,01:48:36.551,Maybe she wants the LCD on?
01:48:37.219,01:48:39.054,There's probably a C somewhere.
01:48:39.763,01:48:41.389,C.
01:48:42.349,01:48:43.266,C.
01:48:58.990,01:48:59.866,Found it.
01:49:05.956,01:49:07.874,Kill?
01:49:09.376,01:49:10.544,Kill all?
01:49:19.427,01:49:22.889,She definitely killed it all in this round.
01:49:24.724,01:49:26.142,D comes last.
01:49:26.226,01:49:27.394,Killed All.
01:49:27.477,01:49:29.354,"Mrs. Ra, is it Kill all, right?"
01:49:33.149,01:49:34.901,"She says, no."
01:49:35.443,01:49:39.030,Then KLD? Killed?
01:49:40.031,01:49:41.741,Am I right?
01:49:44.119,01:49:45.161,See?
01:49:45.787,01:49:47.372,It's Killed.
01:49:49.416,01:49:51.084,"Whatever, let's keep playing."
01:49:52.627,01:49:54.212,-Whose turn is it? -Wait.
01:49:55.672,01:49:57.173,Killed who?
01:50:12.897,01:50:15.567,Mahjong brings back memories of Gang-u?
01:50:16.860,01:50:19.946,"Mom, it's not your fault."
01:50:20.030,01:50:22.073,He didn't die because of you.
01:50:22.699,01:50:24.951,Stop playing and go to bed.
01:50:27.495,01:50:28.830,Tae-ju's so strong.
01:50:37.756,01:50:40.508,"Mrs. Ra, stop torturing yourself."
01:50:40.592,01:50:42.218,Look at me.
01:50:42.969,01:50:45.221,It was an accident. It was no one's fault.
01:50:45.305,01:50:47.140,No one killed Gang-u.
01:51:20.799,01:52:48.011,It's not like Tae-ju and Sang-hyeon killed… Selfish humans.
01:52:49.888,01:52:55.310,Bastards coming to play mahjong with a grieving family.
01:53:01.065,01:53:01.900,What?
01:53:03.610,01:53:05.945,Why you little shit.
01:53:09.240,01:53:14.496,"I'm leaving, because shit smells, not scares."
01:53:38.728,01:53:41.189,Honey! No!
01:53:54.452,01:53:55.578,Yeong-du.
01:53:56.663,01:53:58.039,Yeong-du?
01:54:23.940,01:54:25.024,Stop it.
01:55:12.030,01:55:15.116,You easy-blood drinking coward.
01:55:57.158,01:56:00.536,It's because he's dead and the heart stopped pumping.
01:56:03.790,01:56:12.548,Cut off the ankles and hang them over the bathtub and let gravity do the rest.
01:56:14.467,01:56:17.845,We can put the blood in tupperware and keep it in the fridge.
01:56:19.889,01:56:24.268,I thought of using a motor pump but this works best.
01:56:25.603,01:56:32.777,"Sucking a little and throwing the body away is treating life too lightly, isn't it?"
01:56:52.130,01:56:53.339,Evelyn.
01:56:56.259,01:57:01.764,How could I have made all those kimbaps without you?
01:57:03.182,01:57:04.809,It's over now.
01:57:06.686,01:57:07.937,Happy?
01:57:21.492,01:57:24.954,Tae-ju. Listen to me carefully.
01:57:28.416,01:57:29.751,Why do I have to run away?
01:57:34.380,01:57:35.673,From my own house?
01:57:35.757,01:57:39.385,Won't they search the house when they find the four people missing?
01:57:47.518,01:57:52.106,They'll barge into the house without dusting off their shoes.
01:57:52.690,01:58:00.198,"If they open the wardrobe and the curtains in daylight, then we'll die?"
01:58:04.911,01:58:06.287,What are you doing?
01:58:11.959,01:58:13.920,You already had your fill.
01:58:50.373,01:58:51.707,Where are we going?
01:59:02.426,01:59:03.803,Where are we going?
01:59:05.221,01:59:06.389,The sun's coming up!
01:59:17.692,01:59:18.526,What?
01:59:18.609,01:59:19.527,What was it?
01:59:20.987,01:59:22.572,There.
01:59:40.464,01:59:43.050,Oh my.
01:59:55.271,01:59:56.814,My...
02:00:41.817,02:00:44.237,Didn't you have your fill from Evelyn?
02:07:23.594,02:07:26.764,I wanted to live with you forever and ever.
02:07:30.851,02:07:32.436,Together again in hell then.
02:07:36.565,02:07:39.652,"When you're dead, you're dead."
02:07:42.363,02:07:45.574,"It's been fun, Father."
