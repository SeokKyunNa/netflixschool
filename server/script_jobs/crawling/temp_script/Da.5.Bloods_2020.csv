00:36:21.958,00:36:25.166,That brother was the best damn soldier that ever lived.
00:36:51.166,00:36:53.375,The man was using Bloods for cannon fodder.
00:36:54.083,00:36:56.916,"White boys who stayed in college, they'd dodge that shit."
00:36:58.000,00:37:02.083,"They put our poor Black asses on the front line, killing us off like flies."

00:37:14.000,00:37:17.500,"Made us believe that we would get home, alive."
00:38:32.291,00:38:33.750,War is about money.
00:38:36.250,00:38:37.583,Money is about war.
00:38:38.333,00:38:43.833,"Every time I walk out my front door, I see cops patrolling my neighborhood like it's some police state."
00:38:43.916,00:38:47.291,I can feel just how much I ain't worth.
00:38:53.333,00:38:55.375,"A direction, a purpose."
00:38:56.541,00:38:59.750,He taught us about Black history when it wasn't really popular back then.
00:39:01.041,00:39:04.541,Schooled us about drinking that anti-commie Kool-Aid they was selling.
00:39:05.333,00:39:08.250,"Yeah, he was our Malcolm and our Martin."
00:39:09.291,00:39:11.916,Norm had a way of keeping us from going off.
00:39:12.750,00:39:14.000,He wasn't no Tom.
00:39:15.250,00:39:18.166,"He was a bad mother, shut your mouth."
00:39:20.166,00:39:21.166,Like Ali.

00:40:04.541,00:40:11.916,"Black GI, your government sent 600,000 troops to crush the rebellion."
00:40:12.541,00:40:19.500,Your soul sister and soul brothers are enraged in over 122 cities.
00:40:20.125,00:40:27.083,"They kill them while you fight against us, so far away from where you are needed."
00:40:29.250,00:40:40.250,"Black GI, the South Vietnamese people are resolute against these fascist acts against Negroes who struggle for civil rights and freedom."
00:40:42.750,00:40:52.208,"Negroes are only 11% of the US population, but among troops here in Vietnam, you are 32%."
00:40:54.625,00:41:00.666,"Black GI, is it fair to serve more than the white Americans that sent you here?"
00:41:01.166,00:41:12.041,Nothing is more confuse than to be ordered into a war to die or to be maimed for life without the faintest idea of what's going on.
00:41:13.416,00:41:19.625,I dedicate this next record to the soul brothers of the 1st Infantry Divisions.

00:41:33.625,00:41:36.708,-Goddamn bullshit. -Got the wrong motherfucking enemy!
00:41:36.791,00:41:39.125,"Yeah, goddamn white man gone too far."
00:41:39.208,00:41:42.500,-The Bible says an eye for an eye. -And a tooth for a tooth.
00:41:42.583,00:41:44.250,We need to kill some crackers.
00:41:44.333,00:41:47.333,"Our brothers and sisters are burnin' shit down back home, Norm."
00:41:48.458,00:41:51.541,"I love you, man, but you're wrong. Dead wrong."
00:41:51.625,00:41:56.333,You're talking about Dr. King. You're talking about a man of peace.
00:41:56.916,00:41:58.791,And that's what got Dr. King killed.
00:41:59.291,00:42:03.041,"I'm as mad as everybody. All us Bloods got a right to be, but..."
00:42:05.208,00:42:06.375,we Bloods.
00:42:07.875,00:42:11.416,Won't let nobody use our rage against us. We control our rage.
00:42:12.416,00:42:16.041,"Now, what y'all are trying to do right now ain't changing shit."
00:42:17.458,00:42:20.000,"So, stand down. That's an order."
00:42:20.083,00:42:22.166,"Nah. Fuck an order, Norm!"
00:42:25.666,00:42:27.416,You're gonna have to kill me first.
00:42:29.958,00:42:31.250,Blood on Blood.
00:43:40.958,00:43:43.083,Believed in Norman like a religion.
00:43:43.583,00:43:46.166,I don't think he believed in anything since.
00:44:02.208,00:44:04.625,"-Whoa! -Hey, who wants a cold one?"
00:44:07.875,00:44:09.250,"Hey, don't let her get on."

00:44:16.291,00:44:19.833,"You're gonna cut it open? No, I'm good. So, how you eat it?"
00:44:21.166,00:44:22.208,It tastes like chicken.
00:44:22.291,00:44:25.125,That probably don't taste like chicken. That's race-related.
00:44:33.875,00:44:35.166,Không. Không. No.
00:44:42.416,00:44:44.583,"No, and thank you. Yes, it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah."

00:46:09.750,00:46:12.541,I didn't kill your mother and father! Fuck you!
00:46:15.666,00:46:17.666,You don't know what the fuck you're talking about!
00:46:32.333,00:46:33.500,"Stop talking, and fuck you!"
00:46:33.583,00:46:35.208,"-Get the boat moving! -Move on, man!"
00:46:35.291,00:46:37.041,-I got you. -Stop fucking talking!
00:46:37.125,00:46:39.875,-Don't know shit about me. -You killed my father and mother!
00:46:39.958,00:46:41.041,What are you doing?
00:46:41.125,00:46:42.916,"He knows what gook means, man!"
00:46:43.000,00:46:44.541,I don't give a fuck about that!
00:46:44.625,00:46:47.750,I don't give two fucks about that. I tried to talk to the man.
00:46:50.833,00:46:53.833,You're just having a panic attack. This shit happen to you all the time?
00:46:54.333,00:46:56.333,"-Yeah, he has PTSD. -This happen all the time?"
00:46:56.416,00:46:57.583,-He gets triggered. -Come on.
00:46:59.708,00:47:02.541,"Hey, David. What you know about it, huh?"
00:47:02.625,00:47:04.333,You don't know nothin' about this.
00:47:04.958,00:47:08.041,-I don't have no fucking-- -Nightmares. You been having nightmares.
00:47:08.125,00:47:09.875,-He does. -I don't have no nightmares.
00:47:13.583,00:47:14.458,I see...
00:47:15.541,00:47:16.750,-Come on. -I...
00:47:16.833,00:47:21.291,"Come on, bud. Come on. There you go. There you go."
00:47:24.833,00:47:25.958,I see...
00:47:28.208,00:47:29.041,ghosts.
00:47:29.125,00:47:31.041,"Well, it happens to all of us, man!"
00:47:31.125,00:47:32.708,"-You seen 'em, too? -Yeah."
00:47:33.208,00:47:35.541,Dead come to you at night? Huh?
00:47:36.666,00:47:39.250,Stormin' Norm comes to me damn near every night.
00:47:39.333,00:47:42.083,"Now, he talk to y'all like he talk to me?"
00:47:44.458,00:47:46.083,Come on. Come on.
00:47:46.166,00:47:47.958,"-Take it easy, man. -Go ahead, get it out."
00:47:48.041,00:47:49.625,-Yeah. -Get it out. Come on now.
00:47:50.208,00:47:52.458,"-Come on, bud. -Think I'm a crazy fuck, don't you?"
00:47:52.541,00:47:53.625,No!
00:47:57.166,00:48:00.041,That's right. Y'all saditty niggas don't like that word.
00:48:00.125,00:48:02.916,"You know what, man? Nigga. Nigga."
00:48:08.875,00:48:11.750,"Look, I'm tired of this bullshit! Squash it!"
00:48:12.916,00:48:15.666,I'm with you. I'm with you.
00:48:18.416,00:48:19.250,Fists up!
00:48:24.833,00:48:27.875,"Get in there, David. Get in there. Put your fist up, David."
00:48:29.458,00:48:30.291,Come on.
00:48:31.083,00:48:35.041,"You, too, Vinh. Go ahead! Fist up, man."
00:48:35.541,00:48:36.583,"Come on, Paul."
00:48:40.958,00:48:45.000,-Bloods! -Norm! Norm!
00:49:23.166,00:49:24.000,Get that out of my face.
00:49:38.583,00:49:40.833,and he told the waitress to pick the poison.
00:49:41.500,00:49:42.416,-Excuse me. -Sorry.
00:50:01.291,00:50:03.125,-Beg your pardon? -I'm French.
00:50:04.125,00:50:04.958,Sit.
00:50:07.375,00:50:08.875,You're traveling alone?
00:50:09.583,00:50:11.958,I'm here with a group of Vietnam vets.
00:50:13.291,00:50:14.541,One is my father.
00:50:16.166,00:50:20.666,"Must be something powerful, coming back after all these years with your father."
00:50:21.250,00:50:22.875,"-Yeah, it's powerful all right. -Yeah."
00:50:24.166,00:50:25.083,What is your name?
00:50:25.666,00:50:30.375,Hedy. Like Hedy Lamarr. No?
00:50:30.458,00:50:32.666,Old time Hollywood star.
00:50:33.875,00:50:36.375,"But, well, my last name is Bouvier, so..."
00:50:37.833,00:50:38.666,Cool.
00:50:39.375,00:50:40.250,It's cool.
00:50:41.416,00:50:44.708,"-Uh, I'm David. -Ah, David from the Bible."
00:50:49.375,00:50:50.458,Motown.
00:50:52.166,00:50:53.333,"Yeah, you got it."
00:50:56.708,00:50:59.166,Is there another place to go at night around here?
00:51:20.208,00:51:21.041,Thank you.
00:51:23.916,00:51:24.958,So...
00:51:27.416,00:51:28.791,what's their story?
00:51:29.375,00:51:32.500,"Well, Simon is my best friend."
00:51:33.708,00:51:38.291,And Seppo and I use each other for sex once in a blue moon.
00:51:39.291,00:51:44.750,"What do you, Simon and Sep... Seppo... Seppo... what do you do?"
00:51:44.833,00:51:49.375,"We locate old landmines, and detonate bombs, too."
00:51:49.458,00:51:50.500,Wow!
00:51:53.250,00:51:55.458,"Yeah, that's some gangster shit. For sure!"
00:51:56.250,00:52:01.000,How does one get involved in the landmine disposal business? Pray tell.
00:52:01.833,00:52:04.500,The Bouviers have a history in Vietnam.
00:52:06.083,00:52:09.500,It's strange how a war never ends for those involved.
00:52:09.583,00:52:12.916,"See, like, landmines planted years ago..."
00:52:13.833,00:52:17.166,and still harvesting death all these years later.
00:52:17.583,00:52:19.166,Back to your family history.
00:52:19.666,00:52:30.125,"My family made several fortunes owning a rubber plantation, and then they bought up much more of the rice market and made another fortune."
00:52:30.208,00:52:31.750,"See, the white gold."
00:52:33.541,00:52:34.416,Hmm.
00:52:36.208,00:52:37.791,Wonderful family business.
00:52:38.916,00:52:42.666,"But one exception, we exploited the shit out of the Vietnamese people."
00:52:43.500,00:52:45.625,"So, that's the meaning behind the mines."
00:52:46.291,00:52:49.041,"So, what did the Bouvier family think about what you do?"
00:52:53.708,00:52:59.625,"I'm the founder and the director of LAMB, which I started three years ago."
00:52:59.708,00:53:00.541,LAMB?
00:53:00.625,00:53:04.583,"Yeah, LAMB. Love Against Mines and Bombs."
00:53:12.833,00:53:17.541,who's cast herself as a guilt-ridden bourgeoisie cliché.
00:53:18.041,00:53:20.666,"Hey, look, I know all about bourgeoisie clichés."
00:53:21.500,00:53:24.916,I'm a poverty-stricken fool who loves teaching kids.
00:53:25.500,00:53:28.291,"However, my guilt trip is a lot less dangerous than yours."
00:53:28.375,00:53:29.833,"-Yeah, less dangerous. -Yeah."
00:53:33.375,00:53:35.125,School shootings. No fun.
00:53:37.000,00:53:39.833,"You always been the solid one, always."
00:53:40.541,00:53:44.875,Got a... wife who loves you. Daughter who loves you.
00:53:45.625,00:53:48.500,You got a son who loves you enough for two daddies.
00:53:48.583,00:53:50.416,I couldn't love David...
00:53:53.625,00:53:54.500,back.
00:53:58.583,00:54:02.250,"You got back to the world, you made that transition."
00:54:03.208,00:54:07.083,"Me, I'm all... fucked up inside."
00:54:08.083,00:54:09.541,"I'm broken, man."
00:54:15.583,00:54:16.500,Broken.
00:54:24.166,00:54:26.916,"-Blood, we're all broken. -Not like me, man."
00:54:28.000,00:54:32.333,Norm and I were holding those gooks back when the man bought it. I see him.
00:54:36.208,00:54:37.541,"I saw him die, man."
00:54:43.875,00:54:46.958,-So what? You're blaming yourself? -You don't even know.
00:54:52.333,00:54:56.041,"Paul, when we get back to the world, I'd like you to come with me to a meeting."
00:54:56.125,00:55:00.000,"I don't do that sit in a circle, whine about shit group thing, man."
00:55:00.083,00:55:03.041,I don't do it. I never have and I never will.
00:55:03.125,00:55:05.375,You got to talk to somebody.
00:55:05.458,00:55:09.458,I talk to my brother Stormin' Norman every single night.
00:55:28.333,00:55:29.541,Whoa.
00:55:38.000,00:55:40.708,-David. -David. Okay. How's it going?
00:55:40.791,00:55:41.625,I can't call it.
00:55:42.625,00:55:45.208,"Hey, that dude over there by the bar, is he with you?"
00:55:45.291,00:55:47.333,-He's getting pretty shit-faced. -Uh-huh. Brotherman.
00:55:56.625,00:55:59.833,You Americans are just incredibly uninformed.
00:56:01.666,00:56:07.875,"I guess you're too busy watching reality TV, or electing a reality TV clown for a president."
00:56:07.958,00:56:08.875,Knew that was coming.
00:56:08.958,00:56:24.416,"Well, on behalf of all the Black folks in the USA, which are the only group who didn't vote for the motherfucker, we plead innocent to all charges, claims, accusations, allegations, and associations connected to the Klansman in the Oval Office, so help me God."
00:56:27.500,00:56:33.791,The Bloods search for the lost treasure of youth and the remains of the dearly departed Norman Earl Holloway...
00:56:33.875,00:56:38.416,"-We're going. -...KIA, December 7th, 1971."
00:56:39.375,00:56:43.583,We're here to bring home a fallen brother. A brother!
00:56:44.708,00:56:50.166,"A tomb is sacred, not to be looted by rogues and vandals."
00:56:50.250,00:56:54.375,"There's gold in them hills! Gold, goddamn it, gold!"
00:57:35.208,00:57:37.833,"I gotta tell you, you put on one hell of a tour."
00:57:42.250,00:57:47.166,Nothing is more precious than independence and liberty. Said by our uncle.
00:57:51.791,00:57:54.791,"Actually, he's the father of modern-day Vietnam."
00:57:54.875,00:57:56.416,Like your George Washington.
00:57:56.500,00:58:01.291,"Oh, my dear misinformed, misguided... Thank you."
00:58:01.958,00:58:03.291,...Vietnamese brother.
00:58:04.000,00:58:08.250,Our Uncle George owned 123 slaves.
00:58:09.083,00:58:14.000,"And as they say in our colonists' second language, touché."
00:58:19.458,00:58:23.666,"All right, get my arms and my back, man. What's up? Arms and back!"
00:58:25.208,00:58:27.625,"Bloods, I can't believe we back up in this bitch."
00:58:28.791,00:58:31.458,I'll meet you at this rendezvous location in a few days.
00:58:31.541,00:58:33.541,"-All right. -If you're late or early, don't worry."
00:58:33.625,00:58:34.583,I'll be there.
00:58:35.125,00:58:36.583,I hope you find your friend.
00:58:41.541,00:58:42.666,Bon voyage.
00:58:50.708,00:58:53.833,Bloods. I'm gonna teach you that. Y'all ready?
00:58:53.916,00:58:54.916,"-Yeah, let's go. -Yeah."
00:58:55.000,00:58:55.916,You got the paperwork?
00:59:17.541,00:59:18.375,Yeah!
00:59:59.291,01:00:01.791,"-What's happening, my man? -What's happening, my man?"
01:00:04.208,01:00:05.375,How you holding up?
01:00:06.416,01:00:08.416,"Boy, you ask me that every five minutes."
01:00:08.500,01:00:11.833,"You know, I did make it through Nam on my own. Typical tours, too."
01:00:15.416,01:00:17.000,Let Otis catch up.
01:00:17.083,01:00:19.250,"Damn, Paul, you can still hump it out on point."
01:00:20.250,01:00:23.458,What happens if somebody get heatstroke or sprain an ankle or something?
01:00:23.791,01:00:26.291,"Otis is a medic. A good one, too."
01:00:26.375,01:00:28.166,Even took a few rounds out of me once.
01:00:28.250,01:00:30.458,"From your Black monkey ass, as I recall."
01:00:33.958,01:00:34.791,What's that?
01:00:35.791,01:00:36.750,Water.
01:00:37.708,01:00:40.416,What? I need to take a breathalyzer test?
01:00:44.958,01:00:46.625,I know that. But what are they?
01:00:47.791,01:00:48.625,OxyContin.
01:00:51.291,01:00:54.416,"You think I'm sneakin' a drink, and you on that opioid epidemic shit."
01:00:54.500,01:00:57.166,"-It's prescribed. -Oh, yeah. You writing the prescriptions?"
01:00:57.666,01:01:00.583,"No, the VA. Just like everybody else."
01:01:00.666,01:01:02.291,You best be careful with that shit.
01:01:02.375,01:01:05.083,"-What is this, an intervention? -You need one?"
01:01:07.583,01:01:10.375,Y'all think I'm a junkie? Hmm?
01:01:13.833,01:01:14.833,"Oh, shit."
01:01:15.791,01:01:17.916,There. I don't need this shit.
01:01:47.458,01:01:48.291,This way.
01:02:53.500,01:02:54.500,Gibbons.
01:02:56.125,01:02:58.333,I seen a leopard tear one apart once.
01:02:59.166,01:03:00.583,There are leopards out here?
01:03:01.250,01:03:05.000,Leopards are all gone now. Poachers wiped 'em out.
01:03:05.750,01:03:07.625,-You see that? -What? What? What?
01:03:07.708,01:03:10.750,Shh! Looked like a man walking out there.
01:03:12.000,01:03:13.708,"It was just a flash, but I saw it."
01:03:15.958,01:03:19.208,-Maybe-- Maybe it was a monkey. -No goddamn monkey.
01:03:38.291,01:03:39.916,"Oh, my God."
01:03:47.791,01:03:52.083,"I'm sorry about being on edge, you know. Being back here..."
01:03:55.500,01:03:57.083,it is not easy.
01:03:59.791,01:04:00.833,It's cool.
01:04:03.583,01:04:06.125,"I don't like the way you did it, but I'm glad you're here."
01:04:10.833,01:04:12.416,"Your daddy loves you, you know."
01:04:14.333,01:04:15.500,"You know that, right?"
01:04:17.500,01:04:20.416,-You've got a funny way of showing it. -Yeah.
01:04:21.000,01:04:22.541,But I do. I know it.
01:04:25.166,01:04:26.375,I love you back.
01:04:33.333,01:04:38.125,Damn! Who got the bug spray? Bugs out here eating my ass up.
01:04:40.083,01:04:41.416,Otis had it last.
01:04:46.333,01:04:48.000,What's wrong with your big lumbering ass?
01:04:48.083,01:04:49.833,"Man, you sitting right there."
01:04:51.916,01:04:54.166,"I gotta get up from my rock, walk over there and get it."
01:04:54.250,01:04:55.791,You're one lazy-ass motherfucker.
01:05:05.083,01:05:07.416,You can't get up and do it your damn self.
01:05:10.416,01:05:16.791,You sitting right there. You get it? You see it? Big paddle ass. God damn.
01:05:16.875,01:05:17.875,"Hey, Paul."
01:05:34.708,01:05:36.250,Ain't this a bitch?
01:05:41.625,01:05:42.833,"Nigga, get up."
01:05:45.916,01:05:47.250,"Why you ain't tell us, man?"
01:05:49.666,01:05:52.041,No wonder he wanted to make all the arrangements.
01:05:52.125,01:05:54.416,"-Tiên give this to you? -So, what about it?"
01:06:02.833,01:06:03.666,You all right?
01:06:03.750,01:06:05.875,"You a pussy-whipped motherfucker, ain't you?"
01:06:05.958,01:06:07.666,"Man, you don't see who she is?"
01:06:08.666,01:06:10.541,"And that French fuck, Desroche."
01:06:10.625,01:06:16.583,"I don't know Desroche from Adam's house cat, but if Tiên vouched for him, that's good enough for me."
01:06:17.125,01:06:20.541,"She's a Soul Alley ho, remember that."
01:06:21.125,01:06:23.625,"You know, Paul, you better check yourself."
01:06:23.708,01:06:27.250,I know your mama-san's slanted pussy strung you out.
01:06:27.333,01:06:29.041,She's still a fucking ho!
01:06:32.541,01:06:35.833,Get your motherfucking hands off me! I'll kill you!
01:06:36.500,01:06:38.416,-I'll kill that motherfucker. -Chill! Chill! Chill!
01:06:38.500,01:06:40.416,Chill! What the fuck's wrong with you?
01:06:41.750,01:06:42.666,"Breathe, man!"
01:06:46.833,01:06:48.166,"Go ahead, give it to him."
01:06:51.500,01:06:53.166,Take it. I'm through with it.
01:06:55.291,01:06:56.166,Here.
01:06:57.916,01:06:58.750,Happy?
01:07:22.208,01:07:24.750,"You come back, you collect it all for yourself, huh?"
01:07:24.833,01:07:27.875,Then why'd I follow your sorry ass out here in the first place?
01:07:27.958,01:07:30.541,"'Cause you couldn't afford the airfare, the gear, hotel."
01:07:34.541,01:07:35.375,Shut up!
01:07:37.458,01:07:39.125,You and Tiên are up to something.
01:07:40.333,01:07:42.666,"Let me tell you something, Otis, all y'all."
01:07:44.666,01:07:49.375,I don't need this shit. You got me? I'm here for Norm.
01:07:50.333,01:07:54.583,I'm here for Norm. I ain't going for no okey-doke bullshit.
01:07:55.500,01:07:58.958,"Dope fiend double-cross, hell no. Fuck that."
01:08:01.833,01:08:03.416,"Where you going, boy?"
01:08:03.500,01:08:05.708,I'mma go down to the bank and make a deposit.
01:08:13.333,01:08:14.833,This don't make no damn sense.
01:08:18.583,01:08:20.041,"Shit, man. Come on."
01:08:55.833,01:08:59.333,Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:10:04.541,01:10:06.916,Check your map. Check your map. Check your map.
01:10:08.708,01:10:10.291,We're in the right coordinates.
01:10:16.041,01:10:19.583,"Hallowed ground, Bloods. Holy ground."
01:10:24.500,01:10:25.541,"Yeah, that's it."
01:10:31.333,01:10:32.958,"Yeah, it is, Bloods!"
01:10:37.291,01:10:39.250,"No! No evidence, man. No evidence."
01:10:47.166,01:10:49.333,-Yeah! Yeah! -Yeah!
01:10:51.916,01:10:53.041,Come on!

01:11:31.958,01:11:32.958,Look out for your hands.
01:12:01.083,01:12:03.166,"-Shit. -Wait, where is it? Where is it?"
01:12:05.750,01:12:07.041,Let me tip it.
01:12:08.166,01:12:10.625,Ah! Fuckin' fool's gold.
01:12:14.708,01:12:16.583,"We are some gold-plated fools, y'all."
01:12:17.208,01:12:19.875,We're some gold-plated motherfucking fools.
01:12:19.958,01:12:22.791,"Hey, guys, guys, I got another one! I got something right here."
01:12:23.875,01:12:25.083,-Right here. -I got it!
01:12:32.958,01:12:34.666,-I got another one right here. -I'm coming!
01:12:34.750,01:12:36.000,-Right there. -All right.
01:13:19.166,01:13:21.916,I'm getting hits all over the mountain! All over the mountain!
01:13:34.458,01:13:36.958,"Hey, I got one here. I got one here."
01:13:37.041,01:13:39.125,They must've fallen in the mudslide.
01:13:39.208,01:13:41.916,"Hey, I got something to tell y'all."
01:13:42.000,01:13:43.041,-What? -What?
01:13:43.875,01:13:48.625,"Holy motherfucking, motherfucking, mother of gold!"
01:13:53.958,01:13:57.583,"Motherfucker, I don't dig for the gold! I find the motherfucking gold!"
01:13:57.666,01:13:58.875,-Fuck you! -Silly-ass.
01:14:04.125,01:14:08.500,Forty-five thousand per bar. Seventeen million all in.
01:14:11.416,01:14:13.416,But I'm not leaving here without Norman.
01:14:17.333,01:14:20.791,You remember what Norman said. That gold should go to our people.
01:14:22.833,01:14:24.875,"Whoa, what you trying to say, man?"
01:14:25.541,01:14:27.750,That gold should go towards Black liberation.
01:14:31.750,01:14:34.125,"I'm talking about Black reparations, man."
01:14:36.333,01:14:37.541,What about our people?
01:14:37.625,01:14:39.083,What about my people?
01:14:39.583,01:14:42.958,"You do what you want with your share, and we'll each decide for ourselves."
01:14:43.041,01:14:46.250,"-That's what Norman said now. -Now, see? See? Otis knows."
01:14:46.750,01:14:49.708,Norman wanted that gold to go towards the cause.
01:14:49.791,01:14:53.916,"Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Eddie. You rich. Money don't mean shit to you."
01:14:54.000,01:14:57.083,"-I am not rich. -Yeah, right. Whatever."
01:14:59.375,01:15:02.833,"-I'm broke, man. -How the fuck are you broke, Eddie? Huh?"
01:15:06.666,01:15:09.500,"-I lost it all. -Oh, he bullshittin'."
01:15:11.000,01:15:12.166,"I wish I was, man."
01:15:13.166,01:15:14.291,Spill it.
01:15:16.750,01:15:18.541,"Come on, man. Fess up."
01:15:22.416,01:15:30.958,"Ex-wives, bad investments, back taxes, livin' large, drinking, being stupid."
01:15:31.500,01:15:35.208,"-You fuckin' name it, I spent money on it. -But you paid for all of this shit."
01:15:35.291,01:15:39.333,"Yeah, yeah, I paid for all this shit on a black card that's already overdrawn."
01:15:40.833,01:15:43.750,What about all them car dealerships with your name on 'em?
01:15:44.750,01:15:45.833,I don't own 'em.
01:15:46.625,01:15:48.958,"I mean, my name is good in the business and all, and..."
01:15:49.500,01:15:51.291,"dealers choose to use 'em, but..."
01:15:51.375,01:15:54.291,they'll pull that shit as soon as it stops working for 'em.
01:15:54.875,01:15:59.916,"I'm telling you, I ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. And that's facts!"
01:16:04.416,01:16:05.375,God damn.
01:16:07.708,01:16:08.708,"Sorry, bro."
01:16:11.375,01:16:12.875,Can we just go find Norm?
01:16:15.750,01:16:17.500,Stormin' Norm's been waiting.
01:16:26.875,01:16:27.708,Damn.
01:16:29.375,01:16:30.833,Ain't that some doo-doo.
01:17:06.250,01:17:10.083,"Hey, Bloods, I got something! Right here I got... I'm getting a big hit."
01:17:10.875,01:17:13.125,"-I'm getting a big hit, right here. -Are you sure?"
01:17:13.208,01:17:17.125,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all over, right in here. Right in this whole area."
01:17:26.958,01:17:28.458,"Right in here, baby. Right in there."
01:17:53.916,01:17:55.541,"Oh, my God! Oh, God!"
01:18:03.500,01:18:04.541,That's...
01:18:07.375,01:18:08.541,Shit.
01:18:15.958,01:18:16.833,It's Norm.
01:18:19.208,01:18:20.583,"Oh, brother."
01:19:21.291,01:19:23.333,Shit. Shit.
01:19:29.125,01:19:29.958,Shit.
01:19:35.541,01:19:36.625,"We all here, man."
01:19:38.333,01:19:41.166,"Otis, Melvin, Eddie."
01:19:44.500,01:19:47.666,"I got my son, David. Right here."
01:19:51.458,01:19:53.791,"Took us a little longer than we thought, but..."
01:19:55.250,01:19:57.583,we came back like we said we would.
01:20:01.166,01:20:11.958,"But this time when we get on that plane, that Freedom Bird, going back to the world, you are coming with us, brother. You coming with us, brother."
01:20:15.083,01:20:23.666,"Now, both of your parents have passed, I guess you know that, but your sisters, Janet and Kim, will be waiting for us..."
01:20:28.166,01:20:29.958,"when we land, brother."
01:20:34.875,01:20:37.291,"You goin' home, Blood."
01:20:41.291,01:20:42.666,"You're goin' home, Blood."
01:20:49.083,01:20:50.416,"Come on, now."
01:21:10.208,01:21:11.416,Blessed holy God.
01:21:14.125,01:21:16.458,We come around your mighty throne of grace...
01:21:17.500,01:21:19.500,to thank you for this day.
01:21:23.416,01:21:28.750,We thank you for the reunion of family... and friendship...
01:21:30.541,01:21:31.750,and the brotherhood.
01:21:34.958,01:21:39.625,"Continuing in prayer, Lord, we ask you for traveling grace..."
01:21:40.708,01:21:42.041,and the mending of hearts.
01:21:43.791,01:21:46.208,"In your son's righteous and holy name, we pray."
01:21:51.208,01:21:52.791,Damn! What is that sound?
01:21:54.333,01:21:56.333,"Uh, cicadas."
01:21:57.791,01:21:59.791,-Cicadas? -Yeah.
01:22:00.833,01:22:02.708,They don't sound like that back home.
01:22:04.291,01:22:05.625,"We ain't home, son."
01:22:08.166,01:22:09.166,We ain't home.
01:23:06.541,01:23:07.833,"Hand me my water, man."
01:23:14.708,01:23:17.125,"Hey, I can manage another 30, 40 pounds."
01:23:17.625,01:23:19.208,"-Yeah. -That be just great, bud."
01:23:19.291,01:23:22.791,"My son play the pack mule, my son gets a fair share."
01:23:24.500,01:23:27.041,"-It's fine, Dad. It's fine. -No, the hell it is."
01:23:27.666,01:23:32.333,"When did you turn into a grade-A, first-rate, certified, old, tired and crazy motherfucker?"
01:23:32.416,01:23:33.625,"Ah, fuck you, man."
01:23:35.708,01:23:42.416,"When you've been cheated in life as much as I have, you learn to spot the sign of all them dirty rat bastards out there."
01:23:47.333,01:23:49.250,That enough? You want more?
01:23:49.333,01:23:51.750,"-Man, get that out of my fucking face. -Huh?"
01:23:53.333,01:23:54.416,Do you remember?
01:23:56.458,01:23:58.500,You remember what Norm said about money?
01:24:02.000,01:24:03.416,I don't remember that.
01:24:06.208,01:24:13.833,"No, no, no. I am sick and tired of trying to get you fools to love one another."
01:24:13.916,01:24:18.125,"Go ahead! You wanna tear each other apart, go on. Go on!"
01:24:19.250,01:24:20.625,Here I thought...
01:24:20.708,01:24:24.166,I hoped that we could be Bloods one more time.
01:24:24.666,01:24:27.458,"But, no, that ain't gonna never happen again because of this."
01:24:28.666,01:24:33.250,"Traded brotherhood for this shit. Right, Paul?"
01:24:33.333,01:24:35.500,That motherfucker walks backward pigeon-toed.
01:24:35.583,01:24:58.166,"Eddie, you black as a damn crow Ain't white like snow And if you didn't know If you ain't got no dough Then you don't go And that's for damn sure ...that money is the root of all-- -Oh, my God! -What the fuck?"
01:25:02.416,01:25:03.250,Eddie.
01:25:07.375,01:25:08.458,It's a minefield!
01:25:31.791,01:25:34.083,-I got you. -Bloods.
01:25:52.791,01:25:54.208,-Jesus! -What?
01:25:54.291,01:25:56.625,Jesus! Dad! Dad! I think I stepped on something.
01:25:59.750,01:26:01.416,"David, don't move. Don't move."
01:26:08.791,01:26:09.625,Hey!
01:26:09.708,01:26:13.416,"Dad, no, no! Put it down! Put it down! They can help!"
01:26:17.375,01:26:20.583,"-Is it a pressure plate? -Well, if it was, he would be dead."
01:26:20.666,01:26:24.250,"Uh, maybe it's a dud. Or maybe it's not."
01:26:30.875,01:26:32.083,"Okay, come on."
01:26:38.083,01:26:41.083,"And, David... don't move."
01:26:42.416,01:26:43.916,What are we gonna do about my son?
01:26:44.458,01:26:48.333,"Well, all he can do is lift up his foot and pray to God it doesn't explode."
01:26:49.958,01:26:52.083,There's gotta be something else we can do.
01:26:53.000,01:26:54.500,"Well, if there is, I don't know it."
01:26:54.583,01:26:57.875,Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
01:27:01.125,01:27:02.083,Jethro Bodine.
01:27:02.666,01:27:04.291,-What? -Who?
01:27:04.791,01:27:07.166,Remember that big ol' hillbilly kid from Oklahoma?
01:27:07.250,01:27:09.291,He stepped on a toe popper. Remember?
01:27:09.375,01:27:11.833,"-Yeah. Yeah. -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:27:11.916,01:27:13.666,"Okay, we're gonna spring my son..."
01:27:14.208,01:27:16.916,"the same way we sprung that hillbilly kid, you got me?"
01:27:19.666,01:27:20.583,Give me that rope.

01:27:28.708,01:27:30.791,"Straight to me, I swept it. You're good. You're good."
01:27:33.333,01:27:37.875,"Do us both a favor. Don't fucking shift your weight, okay?"
01:27:38.541,01:27:39.833,Stay right where you are.
01:27:39.916,01:27:43.416,"David, I want you to take this rope."
01:27:44.583,01:27:49.625,I want you to wrap this rope around your body. Two times.
01:27:49.708,01:27:53.208,Go ahead. Twice around your body.
01:27:53.916,01:27:57.291,"Go on, like that. There you go."
01:27:59.500,01:28:03.791,"High as you can, man. High as you can. Right."

01:29:02.791,01:29:04.125,What you gonna do?

01:29:36.875,01:29:38.708,"-That's good, big man! Right there. -Yeah."
01:29:38.791,01:29:40.000,Fuck. Fuck.
01:29:45.791,01:29:49.208,"Now, everybody..."
01:29:51.250,01:29:53.458,you get an armful and a handful of rope.
01:29:56.333,01:29:57.958,-We good? -We good.
01:29:59.208,01:30:03.541,"On count of three, you pull harder than a motherfucker!"
01:30:05.458,01:30:06.291,You got me?
01:30:08.208,01:30:09.166,All right.
01:30:12.916,01:30:14.083,One...
01:30:15.541,01:30:16.583,two...
01:30:18.041,01:30:18.875,three!
01:30:38.416,01:30:39.875,All right. Now...
01:30:43.416,01:30:46.708,Get on your knees. If you get... Get on your fucking knees.
01:30:46.791,01:30:49.458,-Dad. -Put that damn gun down now!
01:30:49.541,01:30:50.875,"We're compromised, Melvin."
01:30:51.458,01:30:54.375,"Okay, okay, okay. Just take it easy now."
01:30:54.458,01:30:57.833,"Whatever you're doing, it's none of our business. We can just go."
01:30:57.916,01:31:01.500,"Otis, the sound of those blasts traveled, man."
01:31:02.125,01:31:04.041,Somebody is on their way here right now.
01:31:06.625,01:31:08.458,"-We gotta get somebody for Eddie, Dad. -Hey, man."
01:31:08.541,01:31:10.000,American Embassy. Somebody.
01:31:10.083,01:31:13.791,"-We can't tell nobody nothing. -Just slow the fuck down, man."
01:31:13.875,01:31:15.166,We have to bury Eddie.
01:31:15.250,01:31:18.083,"Are you deaf, man? Are you deaf? Are you deaf?"
01:31:18.166,01:31:19.750,"We gotta get out of here, Otis!"
01:31:19.833,01:31:22.291,-I'm not leaving Eddie like that! -I can be helpful to you.
01:31:22.791,01:31:25.916,You can be helpful? Okay.
01:31:27.541,01:31:30.208,Can you bring back the dead? Huh?
01:31:34.291,01:31:35.666,Let's just talk about it.
01:31:35.750,01:31:38.916,"Otis, you ain't giving the orders, man. I'm running shit now."
01:31:42.416,01:31:44.125,Dad! Dad!
01:31:44.208,01:31:47.833,Dad nothing. Dad nothing. Dad nothing!
01:31:52.500,01:31:59.916,"Boy, I've killed far better men than you, and I will not hesitate to plug a hole in you right now."
01:32:01.541,01:32:04.208,"David, tie 'em up."
01:32:07.958,01:32:11.791,You want your share? Tie 'em up.
01:32:13.083,01:32:14.666,You wanna remain my son?
01:32:17.250,01:32:20.583,Get at it. Get at it.
01:32:26.375,01:32:28.166,"Come here, son. Come here. Come here."
01:32:35.083,01:32:36.333,You had me fooled.
01:32:44.875,01:32:50.250,You got something to say? You say it to me. Not my son.
01:32:58.416,01:32:59.833,Let me tell y'all something.
01:33:00.416,01:33:01.791,I'm the motherfucker.
01:33:03.291,01:33:05.916,I... am the motherfucker.
01:33:06.000,01:33:09.208,I'm the motherfucker. I'm the motherfucker.
01:33:16.791,01:33:18.125,"So long, Blood."
01:33:19.625,01:33:20.958,Rest in power.
01:33:23.583,01:33:24.416,Amen.
01:33:25.375,01:33:26.375,-Amen. -Amen.
01:33:30.416,01:33:32.541,We should give Eddie's share to his family.
01:33:34.625,01:33:36.333,"It's the right thing to do, y'all."
01:33:39.666,01:33:40.666,And David?
01:33:43.791,01:33:46.041,That's my boy. He deserves a fair share.
01:33:50.083,01:33:50.916,Deal?
01:34:30.958,01:34:34.708,Yeah. You seemed so fuckin' sure of yourself.
01:34:35.541,01:34:40.500,Should've known you're actually just a spineless fucking rat.
01:34:41.166,01:34:45.750,"Hedy, you can't still want this guy. Look at him, his father's gonna kill us."
01:34:45.833,01:34:47.083,"Seppo, shut up."
01:34:47.708,01:34:50.291,"Well, your father scares me more than landmines."
01:34:57.041,01:34:58.583,"-Yeah, over here. -Here?"
01:35:01.250,01:35:03.250,"Take us about a day, and we get to..."
01:35:09.583,01:35:13.166,You be careful with this OxyContin shit. It can be addictive.
01:35:20.375,01:35:23.166,-Where were we? -What about right here?
01:35:23.250,01:35:25.958,-But I think that Vinh should-- -Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.
01:35:26.625,01:35:29.583,Vinh is out. He in cahoots with Charlie.
01:35:32.125,01:35:33.458,"Ain't that right, traitor?"
01:35:37.000,01:35:39.000,If you don't trust me by now...
01:35:40.583,01:35:44.375,just shoot me... when you kill them.
01:35:54.000,01:35:55.000,What the hell is that?
01:35:55.916,01:36:00.541,"Night vision, baby. Night vision. Let's see what's shaking."
01:36:04.500,01:36:06.083,I need to urinate.
01:36:07.333,01:36:10.541,"-She needs to pee. -Yeah, I heard her. I'm not deaf."
01:36:11.250,01:36:15.583,"Yeah, I know the Geneva Convention's off the table, but maybe just let her take a piss."
01:36:16.458,01:36:20.000,"Well, could you untie my hands? Please."
01:36:20.500,01:36:21.875,"You gotta go, you gotta go."
01:36:25.541,01:36:26.583,"Fast, all right?"
01:36:45.166,01:36:47.041,to be under better circumstances?
01:36:54.041,01:37:01.333,Were you flirting with me the other night because you were looking for an easy fuck or because you were actually interested in me?
01:37:01.875,01:37:05.041,"-Actually, I'm interested. -Uh-huh?"
01:37:08.875,01:37:14.750,"Yeah. You left your wealthy family behind to do something good, help people, kids."
01:37:17.541,01:37:20.333,"And you're fine, too. I ain't gonna lie."
01:37:26.041,01:37:30.250,"Give me a ten-minute head start. All I ask, please?"
01:37:32.541,01:37:33.375,Hmm?
01:37:34.166,01:37:38.416,"You know, I hate to cockblock. She cute, though."
01:37:40.583,01:37:42.166,"Mel, take her back to the tree."
01:37:43.291,01:37:45.375,"You better listen to your pop, son."
01:37:45.458,01:37:49.333,"You're a worthless fuck. Just so you know, I was only trying to escape."
01:37:49.416,01:37:51.583,I wouldn't fuck you for all the gold in the world.
01:38:13.750,01:38:17.583,Just what I thought. Just what I thought.
01:38:25.625,01:38:28.125,"Mel, you make sure that rope is tight."
01:38:30.666,01:38:31.791,Okay. Okay.
01:38:35.500,01:38:37.875,Drag his ass over there. Drag his ass over there.
01:38:52.833,01:38:55.583,"David, you don't see what Otis is doing?"
01:38:56.166,01:38:59.250,You're playin' into his fuckin' hands!
01:39:00.375,01:39:03.333,Your dear mother would be ashamed of you!
01:39:04.708,01:39:08.208,"Yeah, you ain't no fuckin' son of mine!"
01:39:09.250,01:39:10.875,You're dead to me. You hear me?
01:39:15.250,01:39:17.541,"-Fucking disgrace! -Get the rope! Get the rope, David."
01:39:17.625,01:39:20.666,Don't get shit. You stay your ass right the fuck there.
01:39:48.458,01:39:50.291,You've had quite an adventure.
01:39:51.833,01:39:53.583,"-My friend, let me help. -Oh, no."
01:39:53.666,01:39:56.000,"I got it, I got it. Thank you. Thank you, I got it."
01:39:56.500,01:39:57.375,Hey.
01:40:08.125,01:40:10.125,-Get this off of me. -Where's Eddie?
01:40:20.083,01:40:21.541,He insisted.
01:40:23.166,01:40:25.250,That boy is stubborn as an old mule.
01:40:32.000,01:40:33.916,I knew you should not have gone alone.
01:40:35.083,01:40:37.916,I have a friend in the district. He'll send a rescue group.
01:40:38.458,01:40:41.958,How would you like to earn more money than you ever earned in your whole life?
01:40:47.750,01:40:49.583,"Eddie didn't break an ankle, did he?"
01:40:51.625,01:40:53.208,No. Help me.
01:40:55.375,01:40:56.250,You kill him?
01:40:57.250,01:40:58.291,"Oh, God, no."
01:41:00.416,01:41:01.416,Minefield.
01:41:02.125,01:41:03.250,Otis!
01:41:03.333,01:41:04.791,-Huh? -Here come your partners.
01:41:32.833,01:41:33.833,He ain't our friend!
01:41:33.916,01:41:35.541,-What? -You heard me.
01:41:35.625,01:41:38.500,"Hedy, for God's sakes, help me."
01:41:41.208,01:41:42.291,Otis?
01:41:43.583,01:41:44.541,Please.
01:41:49.291,01:41:50.666,We want him alive.
01:42:03.541,01:42:05.000,-Fuck! -Fuck.
01:42:10.583,01:42:12.416,There's enough for everybody.
01:42:17.791,01:42:18.750,What's he saying?
01:42:21.000,01:42:25.625,Black Uncle Sam. We share.
01:42:30.041,01:42:31.541,"Look, man, we're Americans, all right?"
01:42:31.625,01:42:35.625,"You kill us or hurt him, you got an international fiasco on your hands."
01:42:35.708,01:42:39.041,We're not gonna kill anyone... yet.
01:42:41.791,01:42:43.875,Nobody gets nothing. Nothing!
01:42:44.375,01:42:49.750,"Black Uncle Sam, this is belong to Vietnamese people."
01:42:50.500,01:42:51.708,We take what is ours.
01:42:51.791,01:42:53.708,"Hey, boy, you ain't taking what's ours."
01:42:53.791,01:42:58.000,"You look on that gold bar right there, it says USA, my friend."
01:42:58.083,01:43:00.000,"You, USA?"
01:43:00.083,01:43:01.083,Damn skippy.
01:43:02.166,01:43:05.333,"-It say USA, but I don't think so. -Well, you better believe it."
01:43:06.333,01:43:07.875,"Who the fuck are you, man?"
01:43:10.666,01:43:11.750,Vietnam officer.
01:43:11.833,01:43:14.375,"Oh, yeah? Where are your official badges?"
01:43:16.166,01:43:18.875,We don't need no stinkin' official badges.
01:43:20.708,01:43:22.625,"Do you know Calley, brother?"
01:43:24.916,01:43:30.458,"Yeah. And first of all, you ain't my brother, and I know California, yeah."
01:43:31.041,01:43:32.625,You imbecile.
01:43:33.125,01:43:34.625,It's not a state.
01:43:35.250,01:43:38.916,Lt. Calley. Ever heard of My Lai?
01:43:40.166,01:43:41.958,I know all about My Lai.
01:43:42.041,01:43:49.000,"And you, GI murder, killer of innocent children and babies."
01:43:51.041,01:43:53.375,So why don't you go chew on some motherfucking chopsticks?
01:43:53.458,01:43:55.041,"-Chill, chill, chill. -No, no, fuck him!"
01:44:01.625,01:44:05.666,Make America great again. I show you something!
01:44:29.833,01:44:31.458,Come on! Come on!
01:45:04.666,01:45:05.666,Where's Norm?
01:45:06.208,01:45:08.375,"-He's gone, man. KIA. -Oh!"
01:45:09.375,01:45:11.208,Đi đi mau! Let's move.
01:45:11.291,01:45:12.875,-Go ahead. Go ahead! -Đi đi mau!
01:45:12.958,01:45:14.500,Go ahead. I got this.
01:45:32.791,01:45:36.625,"Turn... I know, turn over. Turn over. Clean through and through."
01:45:41.791,01:45:45.791,"I know, boy. I know. There you go. All right."
01:45:45.875,01:45:47.166,Just keep the pressure on.
01:45:48.583,01:45:50.541,Breathe through it. Just breathe through it. Keep on going.
01:45:51.666,01:45:55.291,Keep on. All right. Press this. Press this on.
01:45:55.375,01:45:58.500,Here we go. Press it on. Press it on!
01:45:58.583,01:46:01.833,"Press it. Press it tight. All right, I know. I know. I know."
01:46:01.916,01:46:04.166,"I know, come on. All right, you got this."
01:46:15.583,01:46:16.666,Clean through and through.
01:46:21.875,01:46:24.375,Straighten up! Straighten up!
01:46:30.416,01:46:31.458,How he doin'?
01:46:45.083,01:46:47.875,"-All right. All right. All right. -Okay, look..."
01:46:49.458,01:46:58.166,"First thing that gook's gonna do when he gets back to town, he gonna round up all the local muscle he can. Now look."
01:46:59.750,01:47:00.708,Who you callin'?
01:47:01.208,01:47:03.958,I'm calling Tiên. She can get us out of here.
01:47:14.208,01:47:16.333,"Ain't nothing to it but to do it, Blood."
01:47:17.083,01:47:18.708,"Don't tempt me, motherfucker."
01:47:18.791,01:47:21.250,What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
01:47:27.458,01:47:29.291,We have very little gas left.
01:47:29.833,01:47:33.125,Perhaps enough gas to get to the temple ruin.
01:47:36.916,01:47:39.916,"If you wanna choose to fight these men, you need some defenses."
01:47:40.708,01:47:45.916,"Otis, try doing the math, huh? Tiên is with the V.C."
01:47:46.541,01:47:49.333,"Otis, that's how they knew about the gold, man."
01:47:49.416,01:47:54.333,That's how this whole fucking ambush was a setup! Mel?
01:47:56.458,01:47:57.625,"No, I do not."
01:47:57.708,01:47:59.541,And you expect him to tell the truth.
01:48:00.833,01:48:04.250,"Okay, look here. Look here, man. Okay."
01:48:05.041,01:48:07.500,We gonna cut through the jungle to a river.
01:48:08.583,01:48:12.916,"To a village, Hng Ng. Right there, Hng Ng."
01:48:13.708,01:48:18.458,"Wait till nightfall. We gonna rip off a boat, and then we skirt past Tân Châu."
01:48:20.916,01:48:23.666,We can't go there. That's 20 miles away from here.
01:48:23.750,01:48:27.583,"So what? You scared of a little bit of exercise, fat boy? Huh?"
01:48:33.125,01:48:34.500,"Man, David is your son."
01:48:35.166,01:48:36.166,My son...
01:48:41.125,01:48:42.333,is a backstabber.
01:48:51.666,01:48:52.958,Are you with us or not?
01:48:55.208,01:48:58.916,My share is my share. You do what you want with his share. Hear me?
01:49:01.083,01:49:03.083,"Listen, you crazy fuck!"
01:49:04.250,01:49:07.916,-Norman wouldn't want us to split up. -That's right. He wouldn't.
01:49:09.458,01:49:14.000,"And that's my problem. Ah. That's my problem, Otis."
01:49:14.875,01:49:19.541,Stormin' Norm ain't with the living. You feel me?
01:49:21.916,01:49:22.958,My problem.
01:49:29.375,01:49:30.541,Peace out!
01:50:02.166,01:50:05.250,He maketh me lie down in green pastures!
01:50:05.333,01:50:10.291,He leadeth me beside the still waters! He restoreth my soul!
01:50:10.375,01:50:16.541,He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake!
01:50:16.625,01:50:24.000,"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me."
01:50:24.083,01:50:29.083,"Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me!"
01:50:54.000,01:50:56.083,I can help you get it out of the country.
01:51:01.041,01:51:04.041,-All right. We'll give you a share. -How much is that?
01:51:07.458,01:51:08.416,Million.
01:51:09.791,01:51:10.833,"We want in, too."
01:51:16.791,01:51:19.166,"Damn, Otis. Just put the gold on Craigslist."
01:51:19.708,01:51:25.916,"Mel, what am I supposed to do, huh? Eddie, Simon, that bullshit with Paul and the kidnapping never happened, all right?"
01:51:26.000,01:51:27.375,And what about Seppo?
01:51:27.458,01:51:30.583,We all know what happened to Seppo. He stepped on a landmine.
01:51:31.833,01:51:34.916,"Hey, so real quick, just for our edification."
01:51:35.458,01:51:37.958,Our share is also gonna be a million?
01:51:40.083,01:51:44.166,Shit!
01:51:54.458,01:51:57.875,I ain't getting fucked again. Trying to fuck me with salt in the Vaseline.
01:52:55.125,01:52:59.500,and to the soul brothers of the 1st Infantry Divisions.
01:52:59.583,01:53:04.416,"Big Red One, 2nd Battalion, 136th Regiment."
01:53:06.000,01:53:07.625,"Have a good day, gentlemen."
01:55:10.000,01:55:13.166,Their mind's weak. They got no intestinal fortitude.
01:55:15.375,01:55:18.333,"Ain't as strong as Paul. No, no, sir."
01:55:18.833,01:55:21.541,Ain't got the guts Paul got. It ain't their fault.
01:55:23.166,01:55:26.625,They was born weak. Otis and his ho.
01:55:27.958,01:55:32.208,"Car thieves, guttersnipes, chain snatchers."
01:55:34.083,01:55:38.791,They ain't snatching... my gold bars.
01:55:40.208,01:55:42.583,"Not Paul. No, sir."
01:55:43.833,01:55:45.666,I ain't getting fucked again.
01:55:45.750,01:55:48.750,Trying to fuck me with that salt in the Vaseline.
01:55:52.333,01:55:55.000,Not Paul. Not this time.
01:55:57.041,01:55:57.875,No.
01:55:59.291,01:56:04.708,Them son of bitches. Son of bitches. Son of...
01:56:06.541,01:56:08.000,Turned my own son against me.
01:56:14.208,01:56:15.375,My own blood.
01:56:16.500,01:56:17.583,God damn.
01:56:20.333,01:56:21.250,Well...
01:56:23.666,01:56:25.583,we gonna see who's standing in the end.
01:56:26.916,01:56:31.958,I don't care what the VA say. VA don't know shit from Shinola.
01:56:32.041,01:56:36.375,Worst fucking doctors in the world. Malignancy? Shit.
01:56:39.375,01:56:41.291,You made me malignant.
01:56:43.750,01:56:45.625,This fucking place here...
01:56:50.166,01:56:55.083,bathed me in that lymphoma Agent Orange herbicidal stew.
01:56:55.166,01:56:57.583,"Those army bastards, they scorched the earth with it."
01:56:57.666,01:57:04.791,"Sprayed that shit in the air and the water, my bloodstream, my cells, my DNA, and my motherfucking soul!"
01:57:07.333,01:57:08.708,But I ain't dying...
01:57:09.791,01:57:10.916,from that shit.
01:57:13.000,01:57:14.208,You will not...
01:57:15.458,01:57:16.750,kill Paul.
01:57:17.833,01:57:18.916,You hear me?
01:57:24.250,01:57:25.291,Hear me.
01:57:28.833,01:57:32.083,You will not kill Paul.
01:57:34.333,01:57:36.958,And the US government will not take me out.
01:57:39.958,01:57:43.375,I will choose when...
01:57:45.291,01:57:47.541,and how I die.
01:57:48.958,01:57:50.083,You dig?
01:57:51.166,01:57:58.875,"You couldn't kill me then, with three tours, you sure in the fuck can't kill me now."
01:58:00.833,01:58:01.833,Right on?
01:58:05.708,01:58:06.833,Right on.
01:58:12.916,01:58:14.166,Right on.
01:58:19.000,01:58:20.916,Right on.
01:58:42.541,01:58:45.500,-I know that thing is throbbing like hell. -Yeah.
01:58:51.750,01:58:52.666,Thanks.
01:58:53.416,01:58:56.250,Don't thank me. Thank your Uncle Meli-Mel.
01:58:57.833,01:58:58.958,You OGs.
01:59:06.833,01:59:09.916,"Hedy, he's running a fever. I think that wound is infected."
01:59:23.833,01:59:24.958,Look after him.
01:59:47.625,01:59:49.458,Get off me! Get off!
01:59:53.291,01:59:54.625,Get off!
02:00:21.625,02:00:22.583,Jacklyn.
02:00:24.375,02:00:25.583,Who is she?
02:00:30.875,02:00:31.958,My mother.
02:00:35.333,02:00:36.458,My mom...
02:00:39.750,02:00:43.125,She had a very difficult delivery.
02:00:52.333,02:00:53.875,And she didn't survive?
02:01:10.041,02:01:11.500,My apology.
02:01:14.333,02:01:18.166,I'm intruding. It's none of my business.
02:01:19.666,02:01:20.916,My father...
02:01:23.958,02:01:25.625,he loved her more than me.
02:01:28.083,02:01:29.791,Never let me forget that either.
02:01:34.791,02:01:37.500,He has hated me since the day I was born.
02:02:15.916,02:02:16.791,Fuck!
02:02:31.208,02:02:32.250,Oof.
02:02:33.125,02:02:37.833,"God, you're a trickster. Oh, God. You're a trickster."
02:03:43.750,02:03:46.666,"You got it, Norm. All for you, baby."
02:03:53.750,02:03:55.000,Life is a bitch!
02:04:00.083,02:04:03.250,"If I gotta go out, I gotta go out like a man, Blood."
02:04:04.666,02:04:07.125,-Morals and ethics. -Hmm.
02:04:07.208,02:04:09.125,Sounds like Stormin' Norman.
02:04:11.958,02:04:16.041,"You know, I keep hearing his voice in my head, telling me to do right, just to get it right."
02:04:19.375,02:04:22.125,Stormin' had this whole living thing figured out.
02:04:23.666,02:04:26.208,We are not gonna die in Nam.
02:04:30.750,02:04:32.291,"Come on, let's battle, Blood."
02:04:48.625,02:04:52.000,"I was asleep. Man, I was fast asleep, knocked out, man."
02:04:52.750,02:04:54.250,God poked and woke me.
02:04:55.791,02:04:59.125,"I said, God... God, why you waking my Black ass up?"
02:04:59.583,02:05:04.250,"God said to me, Paul, fuck them motherfuckers."
02:05:04.666,02:05:06.166,Keep on keeping on.
02:05:08.000,02:05:11.333,"I said to God, God, do what now?"
02:05:12.375,02:05:23.000,"God raised His voice, didn't yell, but put some bass in that heavenly voice, said to me, Fuck them motherfuckers, Paul. They don't know shit."
02:05:23.500,02:05:26.041,Do your thing. Show you're right.
02:05:47.166,02:05:48.583,"What you doing here, bruh?"
02:05:50.541,02:05:52.208,I've been wanting to talk to you.
02:05:53.666,02:05:54.791,About what?
02:05:56.083,02:05:57.125,You know.
02:06:00.875,02:06:01.833,"Go away, man."
02:06:03.416,02:06:04.291,Please?
02:06:06.000,02:06:09.208,"No, no, come on now. Come on now. Come on now."
02:06:10.583,02:06:12.208,"That I can't do, Paul."
02:06:17.916,02:06:19.458,Gonna have to come clean.
02:07:19.000,02:07:19.833,Hey.
02:07:51.250,02:07:52.250,There it is.
02:08:15.333,02:08:17.083,It was an accident.
02:08:20.958,02:08:22.500,"Ain't no thing, Blood."
02:08:24.833,02:08:25.916,Accident.
02:08:29.666,02:08:31.000,I forgive you.
02:08:33.041,02:08:34.125,You hear that?
02:08:36.666,02:08:37.750,I forgive you.
02:08:39.833,02:08:41.000,"Ain't no thing, Blood."
02:08:44.041,02:08:45.166,Come on now.
02:08:46.750,02:08:49.083,"Come on, Paul. Come on, Blood."
02:08:52.750,02:08:54.041,I forgive you.
02:08:57.791,02:08:59.083,God is love.
02:09:00.833,02:09:02.125,Love is God.
02:09:07.833,02:09:10.375,"Come on. Hey, you got me now."
02:09:13.541,02:09:16.791,You got me good. Ain't no thing.
02:09:32.000,02:09:34.833,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
02:09:36.875,02:09:38.208,"I know you, Blood."
02:09:40.500,02:09:41.958,"I died for you, Blood."
02:09:51.166,02:09:53.250,We're always outnumbered.
02:09:54.250,02:09:55.333,Where's gold?
02:09:55.416,02:09:57.291,"Stormin' Norman took it, man."
02:09:59.458,02:10:00.541,It was his.
02:10:00.958,02:10:02.250,Who's Stormin' Norman?
02:10:03.416,02:10:05.750,One bad Black motherfucker.
02:10:09.583,02:10:12.000,"No, I will never tell."
02:10:12.583,02:10:17.416,"See, we're Bloods. We got a bond."
02:10:18.791,02:10:27.291,"We fought... in a immoral war that wasn't ours, for rights... for rights we didn't have."
02:10:29.250,02:10:30.333,They're my brothers.
02:10:30.416,02:10:32.291,You killed my brother.
02:10:35.041,02:10:35.958,I did.
02:11:10.458,02:11:12.958,"-My brother, Marvin. -You're drunk."
02:11:13.041,02:11:15.791,-I ain't never been more sober in my life. -Dig!
02:11:17.958,02:11:20.166,"Okay, it's deep enough, man."
02:11:20.791,02:11:21.666,Okay...
02:11:22.750,02:11:23.708,dig.
02:11:29.125,02:11:30.125,Faster!
02:11:38.291,02:11:39.125,Faster.
02:12:07.125,02:12:08.583,-Keep your eyes open. -On it.
02:12:13.416,02:12:16.958,"After you've been in a war, you understand it really never ends."
02:12:19.750,02:12:24.125,Whether it's in your mind or in reality. There are just degrees.
02:12:24.208,02:12:25.750,Tell me about it.
02:12:30.166,02:12:34.375,"If I happen to die, send my share here."
02:12:42.125,02:12:44.208,One of you two should have this.
02:12:44.291,02:12:45.500,No. I don't want it.
02:12:45.583,02:12:47.208,I ain't fired a gun in my life.
02:12:47.291,02:12:50.083,"I shoot, I'd probably miss by a mile, especially with my leg."
02:12:54.166,02:12:56.500,My father? You seen him?
02:13:01.583,02:13:04.333,"He set up our deal, probably gave us the old flimflam."
02:13:04.416,02:13:06.166,Perhaps I could appeal to him.
02:13:09.041,02:13:10.291,Are you ready for this?
02:13:10.875,02:13:13.083,"Blood, this ain't my first time in Nam."
02:13:35.833,02:13:41.625,"And maybe someday if I come to Paris, you can show me the Champs-Eleesees."
02:13:43.666,02:13:46.250,"You know, the Champs-Eleesees? That big thing y'all got."
02:13:56.375,02:13:57.500,"Yes, sir."
02:14:38.125,02:14:40.000,Who is your pretty companion?
02:15:05.791,02:15:08.375,That the green is more important than Black.
02:15:17.541,02:15:20.291,Norman is pretty particular about what he shares.
02:15:23.166,02:15:25.291,-May I ask you a question? -Yes.
02:15:27.666,02:15:30.041,Was Tiên in on all this?
02:15:31.125,02:15:38.375,"Tiên is a very smart woman, but she doesn't have the appetite for a venture like this. She knows nothing about this."
02:15:39.333,02:15:42.000,She is as innocent as you are ignorant.
02:15:45.625,02:15:47.125,"Well, take the gold and..."
02:15:50.083,02:15:51.333,leave in peace.
02:15:52.500,02:15:53.375,Go with God.
02:15:54.333,02:15:56.500,We just want what we came for.
02:15:56.583,02:15:57.416,Good.
02:17:39.833,02:17:42.250,Straight through. Through and through.
02:18:12.375,02:18:13.291,Grenade!
02:18:32.416,02:18:34.000,There is no one left.
02:18:46.625,02:18:51.625,"Five Bloods don't die, we multiply."
02:18:54.750,02:18:55.916,Allow me.
02:19:09.750,02:19:13.500,Madness! Madness!
02:19:46.625,02:19:47.791,Son...
02:19:50.416,02:19:53.750,"if you're reading this, you know I've met my maker."
02:20:04.916,02:20:15.541,"I gave this letter to... my main man, your godfather, Otis, when we landed back in Nam."
02:20:17.875,02:20:23.833,I came back to confront the demons that haunted me and tortured you.
02:20:25.875,02:20:27.958,I made you feel like you weren't loved.
02:20:32.041,02:20:38.000,"Our brother Stormin' Norman always commanded us Bloods, love one another."
02:20:40.500,02:20:42.166,"In that way, I failed you, man."
02:20:44.291,02:20:46.000,All I can say to you is...
02:20:49.458,02:20:52.041,I'm sorry I put you through holy hell.
02:20:56.916,02:20:58.166,Believe me...
02:20:58.791,02:20:59.958,This just came.
02:21:06.208,02:21:10.666,"There are things about me that you will never know or understand, David."
02:21:20.000,02:21:21.916,I wish I could turn back the hands of time...
02:21:33.583,02:21:34.458,I can't.
02:21:40.583,02:21:41.500,Nobody can.
02:21:50.416,02:21:52.208,I got something I gotta share with y'all.
02:21:52.291,02:21:56.875,We just received a check from our soldier Eddie for two million dollars!
02:22:04.583,02:22:07.041,"When I say Black lives, y'all say matter!"
02:22:17.916,02:22:21.083,Black lives matter! Black lives matter!
02:22:21.166,02:22:25.875,"Thank you. Thank you, everyone being here on this sad but beautiful day."
02:22:25.958,02:22:42.208,"And I'm happy to tell you that this three million dollar gift is donated in the name of my late colleague, Seppo Havelin, and will work toward removing mines and bombs, and also restoring the lives of victims all over the world."
02:23:07.125,02:23:08.083,Left.
02:23:09.250,02:23:10.083,Left.
02:23:11.291,02:23:12.125,Left.
02:23:13.375,02:23:14.250,Left.
02:23:15.416,02:23:16.375,Left.
02:23:26.125,02:23:29.625,"your dear mother, Jackie, and I..."
02:23:32.250,02:23:35.041,will love you always.
02:23:41.833,02:23:47.916,"You best believe I will love you always, son."
02:23:49.875,02:23:51.000,Your father.
02:23:53.500,02:23:54.750,Your dad.
02:24:03.791,02:24:06.875,I couldn't go back home without seeing you both before I left.
02:24:35.875,02:24:37.666,And I love you.
02:25:13.000,02:25:15.375,...To save the soul of America.
02:25:16.750,02:25:22.125,We were convinced that we could not limit our vision to certain rights for Black people...
