00:01:31.174,00:01:34.135,"Hey, love bug. You ready?"
00:01:34.177,00:01:36.013,Yeah.
00:01:36.055,00:01:37.598,"Hey, guess what, Mom."
00:01:37.639,00:01:41.018,I figured out where wasps come from.
00:01:41.060,00:01:43.144,"Well, I think it must be..."
00:01:43.186,00:01:47.315,"if you flick a rock into the air just right, it'll turn into a wasp."
00:01:47.357,00:01:49.150,Dang!
00:01:49.192,00:01:50.569,That's cool.
00:01:50.611,00:01:53.154,"So, how was your day at school?"
00:01:53.196,00:01:55.074,Fine.
00:01:55.115,00:01:58.159,"Yeah, I had a good meeting with Miss Butler this time."
00:01:58.201,00:02:00.161,What did she say?
00:02:00.203,00:02:02.998,"Well, she said that you weren't turning in your homework assignments."
00:02:03.040,00:02:06.043,"And I told her, I know he does them 'cause I check 'em every night."
00:02:06.085,00:02:10.089,She said she found a big chunk of 'em crumpled up at the bottom of your backpack.
00:02:10.130,00:02:11.632,She didn't ask for 'em.
00:02:11.673,00:02:14.175,"Well, baby, she doesn't have to."
00:02:14.217,00:02:18.179,And she said you're still staring out the window all day.
00:02:18.221,00:02:21.100,Not all day.
00:02:21.141,00:02:24.019,And she said that you destroyed her pencil sharpener.
00:02:24.061,00:02:25.980,Not on purpose.
00:02:26.021,00:02:28.189,"Wait, she said that you crammed a bunch of rocks in it."
00:02:28.231,00:02:32.111,"I thought if it can sharpen pencils, maybe it could sharpen rocks."
00:02:33.946,00:02:36.740,"Well, what were you gonna do with a bunch of sharpened rocks?"
00:02:36.782,00:02:40.035,I was trying to make arrowheads for my rock collection.
00:02:41.620,00:02:43.455,Hmm.
00:03:02.557,00:03:05.310,"Dude, it's my turn!"
00:03:17.280,00:03:20.075,Mason!
00:03:21.284,00:03:22.577,Samantha!
00:03:23.411,00:03:26.247,Oh! Tommy.
00:03:26.289,00:03:27.749,Yeah.
00:03:27.791,00:03:30.293,"Well, tell him he has to come home for dinner."
00:03:30.335,00:03:32.253,Okay.
00:03:38.301,00:03:40.261,Where do you think you're going?
00:03:40.303,00:03:42.514,Wait. Come back here.
00:03:45.308,00:03:47.310,Hey.
00:03:47.352,00:03:49.688,Why aren't you ready?
00:03:49.730,00:03:52.357,"- Hey, Mason."
00:03:52.399,00:03:55.276,"- Come on, come on."
00:03:55.318,00:03:57.112,It's 9:00.
00:03:57.154,00:03:59.823,"Okay, I meant to call you 'cause Janice flaked out."
00:03:59.865,00:04:01.616,Why didn't you call somebody else?
00:04:01.658,00:04:03.785,"Well, I can't get a babysitter now."
00:04:03.827,00:04:05.954,But you're welcome to hang out with us.
00:04:05.996,00:04:09.499,"Well, no."
00:04:09.541,00:04:12.502,"- Well, you can go."
00:04:12.544,00:04:14.963,"Yeah, well, I'll come back in a couple of hours."
00:04:15.005,00:04:16.882,Is that okay?
00:04:16.924,00:04:20.219,Yeah. Yes. It's okay.
00:04:24.139,00:04:25.974,Turn back! Turn back!
00:04:26.016,00:04:27.976,I don't wanna talk to Moaning Myrtle.
00:04:28.018,00:04:30.311,‘Who?' said Harry as they backtracked quickly.
00:04:30.353,00:04:35.192,"‘She haunts one of the toilets in the girls bathroom on the first floor,' said Hermione."
00:04:35.234,00:04:39.071,"‘She haunts a toilet?' ‘Yes, it's been out of order all year..."
00:04:39.113,00:04:42.032,because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place.
00:04:42.074,00:04:44.201,I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it.
00:04:44.243,00:04:49.330,It's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you.' Why can't you just say that?
00:04:49.372,00:04:51.666,I'm sorry.
00:04:51.708,00:04:54.335,That's right.
00:04:54.377,00:04:56.671,Would you stop using your kids as an excuse!
00:04:56.713,00:04:58.673,I'm not using my kids as an excuse!
00:04:58.715,00:05:02.803,You don't even know-- You're acting-- You have this immature life.
00:05:02.844,00:05:05.097,I have an immature life?
00:05:05.139,00:05:07.348,You don't know what it's like to be a parent.
00:05:07.390,00:05:10.060,And why am I responsible for your mistakes in life?
00:05:07.390,00:05:12.395,If you had any idea-- Don't call my kids mistakes!
00:05:12.437,00:05:17.151,"I didn't call your kids-- You said, You're respons-- your mistakes in your life, pointing at my kids."
00:05:17.192,00:05:19.360,- Immediately you use your kids again.
00:05:17.192,00:05:22.156,- This is the reality-- I am a parent!
00:05:22.197,00:05:24.908,I would love to have some time to myself!
00:05:24.950,00:05:27.077,I would love to just go to a fuckin' movie!
00:05:27.119,00:05:30.371,You don't think I'd like that?
00:05:30.413,00:05:32.207,I don't even know what that's like.
00:05:32.249,00:05:34.751,"I was someone's daughter, then I was somebody's fucking mother!"
00:05:34.793,00:05:36.670,Okay? I don't know what that's like.
00:05:48.140,00:05:53.061,- Stop!
00:05:53.103,00:05:55.272,Quit it!
00:05:55.314,00:05:59.400,- Quit it!
00:06:03.905,00:06:05.615,Mom!
00:06:05.657,00:06:09.161,- What the hell is going on in here?
00:06:09.203,00:06:13.832,- Do you guys know what time it is?
00:06:13.874,00:06:16.918,Mason. Do not throw things at your sister.
00:06:16.960,00:06:18.920,She's faking.
00:06:18.962,00:06:21.422,"Listen, both of you."
00:06:21.464,00:06:23.884,I don't wanna hear another peep out of here for an hour.
00:06:23.925,00:06:26.636,- Go to sleep.
00:06:29.139,00:06:31.350,Faker!
00:06:44.487,00:06:46.698,Oh!
00:06:46.740,00:06:49.450,Look at that.
00:06:49.492,00:06:51.036,- Dude!
00:06:54.248,00:06:55.540,"I know, right?"
00:06:55.582,00:06:58.210,Look at those.
00:06:58.252,00:06:59.920,Ooh. Look at those!
00:07:02.589,00:07:04.216,Oh!
00:07:19.398,00:07:22.483,"So listen, guys, I wanna talk to you about something."
00:07:22.525,00:07:25.946,"You might not like this idea at first, but we're moving to Houston."
00:07:27.488,00:07:29.532,- When?
00:07:29.574,00:07:32.493,We should be out by the first so we don't have to pay two rents next month.
00:07:32.535,00:07:35.622,"No, Mother, we're not moving."
00:07:35.663,00:07:38.375,Nope. Nope.
00:07:38.417,00:07:41.502,"Samantha, I have to go back to college so I can make us a better living."
00:07:41.544,00:07:44.965,"With this job, I can't take care of us the way I'd like to."
00:07:45.006,00:07:47.508,I can't keep going this way.
00:07:47.550,00:07:49.510,And Grandma said she'd help us out.
00:07:49.552,00:07:51.221,And it would be nice to be near her.
00:07:51.263,00:07:55.683,"Fine, Mother."
00:07:56.977,00:07:58.645,What about our friends?
00:07:58.686,00:08:01.731,"Baby, we can e-mail them or write."
00:08:01.773,00:08:04.525,We can come back to visit.
00:08:04.567,00:08:06.320,And guess what.
00:08:06.361,00:08:09.530,"This place that Grandma found us, you'll each have your own room."
00:08:09.572,00:08:11.450,Right?
00:08:11.491,00:08:13.076,And there's a pool.
00:08:15.454,00:08:18.539,"Mom, do you still love Dad?"
00:08:18.581,00:08:26.131,"I still love your father, but that doesn't mean it was healthy for us to stay together."
00:08:26.173,00:08:31.011,"What if after we move, he's trying to find us and he can't?"
00:08:31.052,00:08:34.181,"Oh, that won't be a problem."
00:08:34.222,00:08:36.557,"He can call Grandma, and she'll tell him..."
00:08:36.599,00:08:38.852,or he can call Information.
00:08:38.893,00:08:40.770,We won't be hard to find.
00:08:40.812,00:08:42.605,Is he still in Alaska?
00:08:42.647,00:08:45.566,"Well, that's what your uncle says."
00:08:45.608,00:08:48.195,Probably taming polar bears or something.
00:08:49.237,00:08:51.823,"Yeah. Well, I hope they're taming him."
00:09:03.626,00:09:05.586,Here. Wanna help me out?
00:09:05.628,00:09:07.214,Sure.
00:09:07.255,00:09:10.591,Take this paint very carefully...
00:09:10.633,00:09:19.767,"and paint any little smudge or mark or anything on the baseboard there, behind the door and all around the doorways on the inside."
00:09:19.809,00:09:24.523,"She says we're gonna come visit, and I'm gonna write and call you."
00:09:25.857,00:09:29.069,"Oh, wait. Hold on a second."
00:09:29.110,00:09:31.405,Hello?
00:09:31.446,00:09:35.616,"Sorry, Tommy."
00:09:35.658,00:09:38.619,And I'm on the other line.
00:09:38.661,00:09:41.622,Althea?
00:09:41.664,00:09:45.293,I'm gonna be sending the scout instructions.
00:09:45.335,00:09:50.173,E-mail and write back telling me how the other scouts are doing.
00:09:50.215,00:09:53.009,"Well, because you're the leader now."
00:09:54.677,00:09:57.680,"Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna get there before it gets dark."
00:09:57.722,00:10:01.601,"Good-bye, yard."
00:10:01.642,00:10:05.688,"Good-bye, box of stuff Mommy won't let us take with us but we don't wanna throw away."
00:10:05.730,00:10:10.151,"Good-bye, house."
00:10:10.193,00:10:11.652,Samantha!
00:10:11.694,00:10:14.406,"Why don't you say good-bye to that little horseshit attitude, okay?"
00:10:14.448,00:10:16.491,'Cause we're not taking that in the car.
00:10:16.533,00:10:20.661,"Good-bye, old lady who listens to rock music and rides a motorcycle."
00:10:46.354,00:10:48.689,"Hey! Hey, what's happening back there?"
00:10:48.731,00:10:51.818,Stop. Put the barrier up.
00:10:51.859,00:10:54.904,Hey! Put the pillow between you.
00:10:54.946,00:10:57.240,Come on. Stop.
00:10:57.282,00:10:59.700,We're gonna play a game called The Game of Silence.
00:10:59.742,00:11:04.122,Whoever can stay quiet for the longest period of time wins.
00:11:04.164,00:11:06.541,You guys think you can do that?
00:11:06.583,00:11:08.960,"Okay, go."
00:11:34.777,00:11:37.738,The bus'll be here in 10 minutes.
00:11:37.780,00:11:40.325,Put that homework in your backpack.
00:11:41.784,00:11:43.203,Go eat.
00:11:47.999,00:11:50.918,"Baby, go eat."
00:12:05.808,00:12:07.768,Speak English!
00:12:07.810,00:12:09.896,Shut up. Mom!
00:12:09.937,00:12:11.772,She's speaking that stupid language again!
00:12:11.814,00:12:13.525,Samantha!
00:12:13.567,00:12:15.860,"I was speaking perfectly clear English, Mother."
00:12:15.902,00:12:17.778,"You know, he's a little slow in the head."
00:12:17.820,00:12:20.574,He did officially flunk first grade.
00:12:20.615,00:12:22.659,"Yes, sir, Mother, sir."
00:12:22.701,00:12:26.787,"All right, listen up, guys."
00:12:26.829,00:12:29.790,"Your dad's in town for the day, so you're gonna spend the afternoon with him."
00:12:29.832,00:12:31.876,Is he moving back?
00:12:31.918,00:12:33.794,I don't know.
00:12:33.836,00:12:36.005,We haven't seen him in about 80 years.
00:12:36.047,00:12:38.216,"Like, a year and a half."
00:12:38.258,00:12:39.842,Ha-ha!
00:12:39.884,00:12:42.095,"Oh, please."
00:12:42.136,00:12:44.805,The bus is coming.
00:12:44.847,00:12:47.016,All right. Nice cursive.
00:12:49.310,00:12:52.063,"Okay, Mason, when I check the mobiles, am I gonna find yours?"
00:12:52.105,00:12:54.232,No.
00:12:54.274,00:12:56.359,'Cause I didn't finish it.
00:12:56.401,00:12:59.195,"Well, it's time to finish it."
00:12:59.237,00:13:02.907,"No, let's do Apple Quit."
00:13:13.418,00:13:16.504,"Time to finish your work, Mason. Apple Quit."
00:13:23.303,00:13:26.139,So this is my history test.
00:13:26.180,00:13:29.850,A-plus. Very good.
00:13:29.892,00:13:32.979,And that's another history test.
00:13:33.020,00:13:35.315,"Yeah, well, it doesn't have a plus, but, oh, well."
00:13:35.356,00:13:38.401,"And then, um, that's my report on lizards."
00:13:38.443,00:13:40.654,Oh. Let me see your pictures.
00:13:40.695,00:13:43.072,"- Oh, yeah, these are my pictures."
00:13:43.114,00:13:45.866,"- Well, that's called a dewlap."
00:13:45.908,00:13:47.868,"Oh, yeah, this is a math test."
00:13:47.910,00:13:51.581,"Oh, A again."
00:13:51.623,00:13:53.249,Okay.
00:13:53.291,00:13:55.376,We need to put this stuff up.
00:13:56.835,00:13:58.254,That's him.
00:14:02.759,00:14:04.927,Daddy! Hi!
00:14:04.969,00:14:08.306,Hey! Oh! Look at you.
00:14:08.348,00:14:11.142,"Hey, M.J.!"
00:14:11.184,00:14:13.394,You guys ready to have some fun?
00:14:13.436,00:14:16.939,Yeah! All right.
00:14:16.981,00:14:18.441,I'm good.
00:14:18.483,00:14:20.360,What time should I have these rascals back?
00:14:20.401,00:14:22.028,"Oh, I don't know."
00:14:22.069,00:14:23.738,I gotta get 'em home by 8:00.
00:14:23.780,00:14:26.282,Why don't I take 'em over to their mom's?
00:14:26.324,00:14:27.950,"No, that's okay."
00:14:27.992,00:14:30.662,"Ah, that's all right."
00:14:30.704,00:14:32.079,"All right, I'll do it."
00:14:32.121,00:14:34.582,- I don't think that's such a good idea.
00:14:34.624,00:14:36.835,You guys ready to go?
00:14:36.876,00:14:39.212,Go? Wait a minute.
00:14:39.253,00:14:41.922,"- Oh, right."
00:14:41.964,00:14:43.591,Homework.
00:14:43.633,00:14:45.926,I can't believe how big they are.
00:14:45.968,00:14:48.179,Yeah. Time's going by.
00:14:49.972,00:14:53.768,"Yeah. It must be nice for you, having them here in Houston."
00:14:53.810,00:14:56.563,"I love it, yeah."
00:14:56.604,00:14:58.648,Yeah? What you doing over there?
00:14:58.690,00:15:00.941,"I'm in the library, reading to the little ones."
00:15:00.983,00:15:03.653,"Ah, great."
00:15:05.988,00:15:07.574,"So, Alaska, huh?"
00:15:08.783,00:15:10.410,Yeah.
00:15:11.994,00:15:15.039,- Are you back?
00:15:15.081,00:15:18.334,- How's Liv?
00:15:18.376,00:15:21.421,Yeah.
00:15:21.462,00:15:26.092,"But she's working, and single parenting-- a lot to juggle."
00:15:26.133,00:15:27.968,"You guys got everything, huh?"
00:15:28.010,00:15:30.137,- Say good-bye to your grandmother.
00:15:30.179,00:15:32.265,All right. Let's roll!
00:15:32.306,00:15:35.976,"You're not the type of kids who like presents, are you?"
00:15:36.018,00:15:37.645,Yes!
00:15:37.687,00:15:40.022,Of course we are!
00:15:40.064,00:15:41.858,Yay!
00:15:41.900,00:15:44.569,I call front seat!
00:15:44.611,00:15:48.364,"All right. Mason gets it on the way there, and Samantha gets it on the way back, huh?"
00:15:48.406,00:15:50.617,Hop in there.
00:15:50.658,00:15:53.994,Seat belts. All right.
00:15:54.036,00:16:02.587,"Not like this car has any seat belts, but-- Nice. Nice!"
00:16:02.629,00:16:04.130,Nice!
00:16:04.171,00:16:07.007,Yeah! All right!
00:16:07.049,00:16:09.844,Yes! Oh!
00:16:09.886,00:16:12.179,Yay!
00:16:12.221,00:16:14.599,That was so good.
00:16:15.516,00:16:17.059,"Let 'em know who you are, buddy."
00:16:17.101,00:16:20.104,Let 'em know who you are.
00:16:23.107,00:16:27.403,Yes! Yes! Yes!
00:16:27.445,00:16:29.196,All right. All right.
00:16:29.238,00:16:31.157,Wish I could use the bumpers.
00:16:31.198,00:16:33.493,Bumpers are for kids.
00:16:33.534,00:16:36.663,"What are you, two years old?"
00:16:36.704,00:16:39.332,Life doesn't give you bumpers.
00:16:42.460,00:16:44.378,There we-- There we go. There we go!
00:16:44.420,00:16:47.047,We got something there.
00:16:47.089,00:16:50.927,We got something! Oh!
00:16:50.969,00:16:54.054,"Last time I went bowling, we had bumpers, and it was a lot more fun."
00:16:54.096,00:16:55.974,"You don't want the bumpers, all right?"
00:16:56.015,00:16:59.059,"You bowl a strike with the bumpers, it doesn't mean anything."
00:16:59.101,00:17:00.770,Trust me.
00:17:02.062,00:17:04.064,Just lay it out on the lane.
00:17:04.106,00:17:11.531,"One, two, three and-- Ka-blam!"
00:17:11.572,00:17:14.074,Let's hear it for the father!
00:17:14.116,00:17:16.076,- Get up there.
00:17:16.118,00:17:17.912,Get out there!
00:17:22.124,00:17:26.086,Four Blackwater operatives have been viciously attacked...
00:17:26.128,00:17:27.547,in their cars in Falluja.
00:17:27.588,00:17:30.090,The bodies and cars were set on fire...
00:17:30.132,00:17:35.095,after insurgents started shooting-- Look at this. It's a disaster.
00:17:35.137,00:17:38.057,Exactly what every thinking person in the world knew was gonna happen...
00:17:38.098,00:17:39.726,before they got started.
00:17:39.767,00:17:44.772,"Bush and his little numb-nut fanatics he's got around him, they don't give a rat's ass."
00:17:44.814,00:17:46.148,That's a quarter.
00:17:46.190,00:17:48.776,- What's a quarter?
00:17:48.818,00:17:51.696,"Oh, sorry. My bad."
00:17:52.780,00:17:54.908,My teacher says it's a good war...
00:17:54.949,00:17:57.117,because it's better to be safe than sorry.
00:17:57.159,00:17:59.620,That's what they're teaching you in school?
00:17:59.662,00:18:02.916,"Listen to your father, okay?"
00:18:02.957,00:18:05.585,Iraq had nothing to do with what happened at the World Trade Center.
00:18:05.626,00:18:08.295,"- You know that, right?"
00:18:08.337,00:18:10.297,"Who are you gonna vote for next fall, M.J.?"
00:18:10.339,00:18:12.132,I don't know.
00:18:12.174,00:18:13.801,He can't vote.
00:18:13.843,00:18:16.136,All right.
00:18:17.263,00:18:21.141,- Kerry?
00:18:21.183,00:18:23.352,Are you gonna move back?
00:18:23.394,00:18:26.480,"Uh, I'm plannin' on it."
00:18:26.522,00:18:29.400,Are you and Mom gonna get back together?
00:18:29.442,00:18:33.947,I don't know.
00:18:35.698,00:18:41.120,"I remember when I was six, you and Mom were fighting like mad."
00:18:41.161,00:18:44.498,"You were yelling so loud, and she was crying."
00:18:44.540,00:18:47.167,"- That's what you remember, huh?"
00:18:47.209,00:18:52.172,"You don't remember the trips to Galveston, camping in Big Bend, all the fun we had?"
00:18:52.214,00:18:53.549,Nope.
00:18:55.217,00:18:57.303,- You ever get mad at your mother?
00:18:57.344,00:18:59.055,You ever get mad at your brother?
00:18:59.097,00:19:01.390,- Yeah. You ever yell at him?
00:19:01.432,00:19:03.726,"Doesn't mean you don't love him, right?"
00:19:03.768,00:19:05.061,Mm.
00:19:05.103,00:19:07.521,"Look, the same thing happens when you're grown up, right?"
00:19:07.563,00:19:09.273,"You know, you get mad at people."
00:19:09.315,00:19:12.192,It's not a big deal.
00:19:12.234,00:19:13.694,What'd you do in Alaska?
00:19:13.736,00:19:16.572,I worked on a boat for a while.
00:19:16.614,00:19:19.784,"Um, I tried to write some music."
00:19:21.243,00:19:23.037,Did you see any polar bears?
00:19:23.079,00:19:25.748,But I saw a Kodiak bear.
00:19:25.790,00:19:28.960,Dad! That's 50 cents for the F-word!
00:19:30.336,00:19:32.588,I'm sorry.
00:19:32.630,00:19:34.924,"Here, take a dollar, all right?"
00:19:34.966,00:19:36.801,Keep the change.
00:19:36.843,00:19:39.137,You guys are gonna be seein' a lot more of me. Okay?
00:19:39.178,00:19:41.388,I missed you two real bad while I was gone.
00:19:41.430,00:19:43.223,I want you to know that.
00:19:43.265,00:19:56.236,"I just needed to take some time, you know, to-- Just-- Your mom and me, okay-- Well, your mother, okay, is a piece of work."
00:19:56.278,00:20:00.074,All right. I think you know that by now.
00:20:00.116,00:20:04.620,I'm just-- I'm so happy to be with the two of you.
00:20:04.662,00:20:06.413,I'm sorry about that bumper business.
00:20:06.455,00:20:08.666,"I'm gonna get better at stuff like that, okay?"
00:20:10.209,00:20:12.003,I got that one at Dripping Springs.
00:20:12.045,00:20:14.588,"And, um, my friend Rodney gave me that one."
00:20:14.630,00:20:16.966,And I bought that one.
00:20:17.008,00:20:19.052,- Yeah.
00:20:19.093,00:20:21.637,Uh-huh.
00:20:21.679,00:20:24.807,What else do you got?
00:20:24.849,00:20:27.852,Snake vertebrae?
00:20:27.894,00:20:31.271,"Mason, I don't want you collecting snake vertebrae anymore."
00:20:31.313,00:20:33.900,Is this the feather I sent you?
00:20:33.941,00:20:38.278,"Oh, Dad, I forgot to show you these basketball pictures."
00:20:38.320,00:20:40.740,You're on a basketball team?
00:20:40.781,00:20:43.283,Wow! Check you out.
00:20:43.325,00:20:44.869,- Beaver claws?
00:20:44.911,00:20:46.787,"What, you hunting beaver, huh?"
00:20:46.829,00:20:49.749,"That's McKinney, that's Meg, and that's Gem."
00:20:49.790,00:20:51.667,Dried Canadian grass.
00:20:51.709,00:20:53.711,Guard.
00:20:53.753,00:20:55.379,"Wait, you scoring any points?"
00:20:55.421,00:20:57.297,About eight or 10 a game.
00:20:57.339,00:21:00.634,That is awesome!
00:21:00.676,00:21:02.302,You cried?
00:21:02.344,00:21:04.055,Aw.
00:21:05.431,00:21:08.475,- Hello!
00:21:08.517,00:21:10.728,Mom's home.
00:21:12.354,00:21:15.315,Hi! Look at this owl Daddy gave me.
00:21:15.357,00:21:17.359,Isn't it cool?
00:21:17.401,00:21:20.362,And look at this bracelet.
00:21:20.404,00:21:24.200,Daddy made this cool hand-carved grizzly bear and this tiki.
00:21:24.242,00:21:25.952,And guess what else.
00:21:25.993,00:21:29.329,"We went bowling, and I made four strikes!"
00:21:29.371,00:21:31.707,"- Yeah, and we got to ride around in Dad's car."
00:21:31.749,00:21:33.333,"- Hey, Liv."
00:21:33.375,00:21:35.335,I know you wanted me to drop them off at your mom's.
00:21:35.377,00:21:37.671,I just thought it'd be easier if I brought 'em over here.
00:21:37.713,00:21:39.924,"Well, it really screwed up my plans."
00:21:41.425,00:21:44.344,We just wanted to show him our rooms.
00:21:44.386,00:21:48.390,- Did you guys eat anything?
00:21:48.432,00:21:50.810,- Did you do your homework or-- - Not yet.
00:21:50.851,00:21:54.272,Can I talk to you outside for a second?
00:21:54.313,00:21:56.565,Yeah. Sure.
00:21:58.400,00:22:00.402,They had more than french fries.
00:22:06.408,00:22:08.035,Hmm.
00:22:16.002,00:22:18.087,Do you think he's gonna spend the night?
00:22:20.589,00:22:23.634,Doesn't look like it.
00:22:51.204,00:23:00.963,"An unconditioned stimulus, something that produces an unlearned, involuntary, unconditioned response."
00:23:01.005,00:23:05.718,"Now, in Pavlov's experiment, what was the stimulus that he used?"
00:23:05.759,00:23:08.846,"Come on now, people."
00:23:08.888,00:23:11.640,"Meat, right?"
00:23:11.682,00:23:14.810,"Whatever meat powder is, it worked on this dog, okay?"
00:23:14.852,00:23:18.438,"Put the meat powder in there, and it produced an unconditioned response in the dog..."
00:23:18.480,00:23:21.234,"which was salivation, all right?"
00:23:21.275,00:23:23.694,"Now, who can give me another example..."
00:23:23.736,00:23:26.404,of an unconditioned stimulus response pair...
00:23:26.446,00:23:27.948,that happens to you every day?
00:23:27.990,00:23:31.994,It's probably happening to some of you right now.
00:23:32.036,00:23:33.453,How about sex?
00:23:33.495,00:23:39.793,"Sure, you know, you see an attractive member of the opposite gender, you have an automatic response, you don't have to think about it."
00:23:39.835,00:23:45.049,"Mick Jagger wrote a song about, Oh, when they call your name, I salivate like a Pavlov dog."
00:23:46.717,00:23:48.761,Thank you very much.
00:24:01.523,00:24:03.609,Dr. Wellbrock.
00:24:03.650,00:24:06.486,This is my son Mason.
00:24:06.528,00:24:08.488,"Mason, this is Dr. Wellbrock."
00:24:08.530,00:24:13.160,"Your son. See, I thought this was a boy genius who was taking my college course."
00:24:14.536,00:24:16.956,"He wasn't feeling well today, so I thought I'd bring him with me."
00:24:16.997,00:24:20.209,Ah! No fever.
00:24:20.251,00:24:22.795,I can tell because I have a nine-year-old son.
00:24:22.836,00:24:24.504,Same kind of deal.
00:24:24.546,00:24:26.924,"- Hey, you play soccer?"
00:24:26.966,00:24:29.343,Neither does my boy.
00:24:29.385,00:24:32.012,My 11-year-old daughter loves soccer. Go figure.
00:24:32.054,00:24:35.515,- Maybe we can get all you guys together sometime.
00:24:35.557,00:24:38.811,"- Well, you ready to go?"
00:24:38.852,00:24:41.105,"Nice to meet you, Mason."
00:24:41.147,00:24:44.400,And thanks for coming to my class.
00:24:44.442,00:24:47.153,Olivia. Nice kid.
00:24:47.194,00:24:49.155,Thanks.
00:24:49.196,00:24:52.992,So you think Grandma might be available for a little babysitting?
00:24:53.033,00:24:56.536,Maybe.
00:24:56.578,00:24:58.289,Really?
00:24:58.331,00:25:00.582,"Well, great."
00:25:01.875,00:25:04.920,"Dead man, dead man, wake up."
00:25:04.962,00:25:08.632,"One, two, three, four, five, you're alive."
00:25:24.148,00:25:26.566,My turn.
00:25:26.608,00:25:28.777,"Oh, they're home!"
00:25:28.819,00:25:31.238,"Hurry, hurry!"
00:25:36.494,00:25:39.579,Mom!
00:25:39.621,00:25:42.582,"Hey, we've returned!"
00:25:44.043,00:25:47.629,"Hi, Dad!"
00:25:47.671,00:25:49.507,That's very nice.
00:25:49.547,00:25:51.509,"Hi, Mom."
00:25:51.549,00:25:54.970,"Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom!"
00:25:55.012,00:25:57.348,Samantha and I made it all ourselves.
00:25:57.390,00:25:59.433,I know the boys helped you with that a lot.
00:25:59.475,00:26:01.268,"No, not at all!"
00:26:01.310,00:26:04.730,That's good. Look at this.
00:26:04.771,00:26:08.192,Don't worry. We got you some absinthe or something.
00:26:08.234,00:26:12.988,"You take this big elevator up, and when we got to the top we flew a paper airplane off."
00:26:13.030,00:26:15.615,And what happened?
00:26:15.657,00:26:19.078,It flew away. Went for miles.
00:26:19.119,00:26:21.621,"Oh, did you guys kiss under the Bridge of Sighs?"
00:26:21.663,00:26:24.542,Yes.
00:26:26.377,00:26:29.463,"- Hey, Mom, can we see your wedding ring?"
00:26:29.505,00:26:31.631,Wow.
00:26:31.673,00:26:36.845,"Technically, that's a fancy step cut surrounded by miniature brilliant."
00:26:36.887,00:26:39.639,I wish we could've gone to Europe.
00:26:39.681,00:26:41.641,"Yeah, we'll go as a family next time."
00:26:41.683,00:26:43.269,"But you didn't miss much, really."
00:26:43.310,00:26:45.645,We just stayed in the hotel room the whole time playing video games.
00:26:45.687,00:26:50.025,- Really?
00:26:50.067,00:26:51.902,Squeaky.
00:26:51.944,00:26:53.737,Would you like to see a dessert menu?
00:26:53.779,00:26:56.656,I told you to put that away.
00:26:56.698,00:26:58.284,Computer games at the table.
00:26:58.325,00:27:00.035,"Yes, uh, please, another bottle of wine."
00:27:00.077,00:27:03.038,"Um, Coke."
00:27:03.080,00:27:05.082,"Mason, you're okay with water."
00:27:05.124,00:27:06.666,"No more Cokes, thank you."
00:27:06.708,00:27:09.211,Did you finish your science project?
00:27:09.253,00:27:11.255,Not quite yet.
00:27:11.297,00:27:14.508,Did you work on it?
00:27:11.297,00:27:16.009,Did you build anything or plan anything or-- A little.
00:27:16.051,00:27:18.678,"- Did he work on it at all, Mindy?"
00:27:18.720,00:27:21.681,Did he sit around playing video games with Mason the whole time?
00:27:21.723,00:27:23.309,Yeah.
00:27:23.350,00:27:25.227,Hmm.
00:27:25.269,00:27:28.314,You were supposed to finish that by the time I got back.
00:27:28.355,00:27:30.107,Remember?
00:27:30.149,00:27:31.609,Hey.
00:27:32.818,00:27:35.653,"Grievous is the best, man."
00:27:35.695,00:27:37.655,"Yoda, man."
00:27:37.697,00:27:39.199,He has no arms.
00:27:39.241,00:27:40.367,Represent!
00:27:40.409,00:27:42.119,I hate Miss Barnsley.
00:27:42.161,00:27:43.829,Everybody's been saying she's lesbian.
00:27:43.870,00:27:46.706,She is.
00:27:46.748,00:27:49.084,"Man, that's gross."
00:27:49.126,00:27:51.795,She's always walking in the locker room.
00:27:51.837,00:27:58.885,"I think I still have a couple of those-- Hey, Paul."
00:27:58.927,00:28:02.139,Damn. Fuck.
00:28:18.572,00:28:21.741,- Uh! I blew up.
00:28:21.783,00:28:23.785,"No, actually it was."
00:28:23.827,00:28:25.538,That's like the fairest thing ever.
00:28:25.579,00:28:26.913,Whatever.
00:28:28.207,00:28:31.460,"- Oh, once again I take you down."
00:28:33.795,00:28:36.632,- Uh-- - Three Musketeers?
00:28:36.674,00:28:38.758,First word.
00:28:38.800,00:28:40.344,Chicken?
00:28:40.386,00:28:41.803,Bird.
00:28:42.804,00:28:44.682,Second word.
00:28:44.723,00:28:46.684,Uh... hood.
00:28:46.725,00:28:48.060,Robin Hood.
00:28:48.101,00:28:49.769,- Whoo!
00:28:49.811,00:28:51.605,Good one.
00:28:52.481,00:28:54.525,Second word.
00:28:56.735,00:28:59.071,"Hey, you can't use props."
00:28:59.112,00:29:01.281,"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
00:29:01.323,00:29:03.783,Judges speak.
00:29:03.825,00:29:07.162,Can't use props.
00:29:08.080,00:29:09.831,"Um, bunch."
00:29:09.873,00:29:11.667,Is it like-- The Gathered?
00:29:11.709,00:29:13.835,"Um, folded."
00:29:13.877,00:29:17.464,Messing around with a blanket.
00:29:17.506,00:29:20.092,A Wrinkle in Time!
00:29:39.069,00:29:41.697,What are the guards at Azkaban?
00:29:41.739,00:29:43.407,Dementors?
00:29:43.449,00:29:46.702,"I-I-- Front of the line, are you ready?"
00:29:50.372,00:29:52.207,"Count down with me, ladies and gentlemen!"
00:29:52.249,00:29:53.292,Ten!
00:29:53.333,00:29:55.544,Nine! Eight!
00:29:55.586,00:29:57.837,Seven! Six!

00:30:02.884,00:30:05.220,Let's go!
00:30:11.393,00:30:13.353,Thank you.
00:30:13.895,00:30:15.397,Thanks.
00:30:21.528,00:30:24.281,All righty.
00:30:30.829,00:30:33.873,"No, no, no, no."
00:30:33.915,00:30:36.876,Nice and easy.
00:30:36.918,00:30:39.296,That's good.
00:30:39.338,00:30:42.341,"Don't swing too hard, Randy."
00:30:42.382,00:30:45.885,"Hey, all right!"
00:30:45.927,00:30:47.887,Back your feet up a little bit.
00:30:47.929,00:30:50.474,"Yeah, like that."
00:30:51.558,00:30:53.519,All right.
00:30:53.560,00:30:56.313,Nice slow swing is gonna be better for you.
00:30:56.355,00:30:57.690,All right!
00:30:59.941,00:31:01.443,"I don't know, man."
00:30:59.941,00:31:03.737,"You must've been-- See, your feet are too open, Randy."
00:31:03.779,00:31:05.864,Nice and natural.
00:31:05.905,00:31:07.783,Yes! Go!
00:31:07.825,00:31:09.909,All right!
00:31:09.951,00:31:12.245,"Good putt, Son."
00:31:12.287,00:31:14.873,"Did you see that, Randy?"
00:31:14.914,00:31:17.250,All right. Birdie putt.
00:31:23.131,00:31:26.259,Goddamn it.
00:31:27.761,00:31:29.596,"Get my clubs, would you?"
00:31:37.270,00:31:40.524,This is just in case we have guests this weekend.
00:31:42.984,00:31:46.154,"He always says that, but we never have a guest."
00:32:17.519,00:32:19.730,"Samantha, I think I heard your dad pull up."
00:32:19.772,00:32:22.023,"Oh, all right."
00:32:22.065,00:32:24.902,Not quite.
00:32:26.111,00:32:27.987,"How about the dusting, Sam?"
00:32:28.029,00:32:29.698,I haven't done that yet.
00:32:29.740,00:32:31.784,"Well, I saw you working on your art project."
00:32:31.825,00:32:35.871,"You had time to finish your little art project, but you didn't have time to finish your chores?"
00:32:35.913,00:32:37.706,I thought we talked about that.
00:32:37.748,00:32:39.541,I can finish the dusting.
00:32:39.583,00:32:42.836,"You have your own chores to do, and Sam has hers to do. Huh?"
00:32:42.878,00:32:45.004,It's simple.
00:32:45.046,00:32:47.006,"Poor choice there, Sam."
00:32:47.048,00:32:48.759,And hurry up.
00:32:57.476,00:32:59.561,Mason!
00:32:59.603,00:33:01.438,Your dad's here.
00:33:03.315,00:33:06.025,"You guys aren't settin' any speed records, are you?"
00:33:06.067,00:33:10.029,"What'd you do, get about half done?"
00:33:10.071,00:33:13.032,"So, did you finish?"
00:33:13.074,00:33:15.661,Is the job complete?
00:33:15.702,00:33:18.497,"So, what are you gonna be doing tomorrow?"
00:33:18.538,00:33:20.039,"Same thing, right?"
00:33:20.081,00:33:21.959,Okay. Go.
00:33:25.044,00:33:27.088,"Bye, Mom."
00:33:27.130,00:33:29.466,"Bye, babe. I love you."
00:33:29.508,00:33:31.718,"Bye, Mama."
00:33:31.760,00:33:34.596,Have fun with your dad.
00:33:36.682,00:33:38.558,The boys didn't finish raking the leaves.
00:33:38.600,00:33:40.560,Samantha did not finish dusting.
00:33:40.602,00:33:47.818,"So tomorrow, when they come home, instead of swimming and all the other little stuff that they wanna do, they're gonna do their chores, right?"
00:33:47.860,00:33:50.696,"Okay, guys, you had this conversation."
00:33:50.737,00:33:53.072,Tomorrow? Okay.
00:33:53.114,00:33:55.074,Thank you. I just wanted you to back me up on that...
00:33:55.116,00:33:57.160,so I'm not the only one yelling at 'em all the time.
00:33:57.202,00:33:59.078,"Okay, I back you up."
00:33:59.120,00:34:01.915,We all agree.
00:34:01.957,00:34:04.877,"Well, they don't hear it."
00:34:04.918,00:34:07.295,"But, Dad, I mean, dusting is pointless."
00:34:07.337,00:34:09.673,It's not pointless.
00:34:09.715,00:34:12.091,"But I mean, who dusts anymore?"
00:34:12.133,00:34:13.969,You do when we ask you to!
00:34:14.011,00:34:17.472,"And don't-- Olivia, don't let her back-talk me in front of the other kids, please."
00:34:17.514,00:34:19.474,Thank you.
00:34:21.142,00:34:22.602,Whatever!
00:34:22.644,00:34:25.271,Bye-bye.
00:34:25.313,00:34:27.399,"Okay. Bye, guys."
00:34:29.192,00:34:31.737,"I'm sorry, but I thought we talked about it."
00:34:31.778,00:34:33.989,"You have to draw a line, you have to back it up."
00:34:34.031,00:34:37.200,"Okay. It's just you have so many lines, Bill."
00:34:37.242,00:34:39.118,Everything's a line.
00:34:39.160,00:34:41.371,"- Hey, Randy. Hey, you guys."
00:34:41.413,00:34:43.331,"Hey, you two."
00:34:43.373,00:34:45.375,Shotgun.
00:34:45.417,00:34:47.335,"Here, let me get this bag here."
00:34:47.377,00:34:49.588,"You doin' okay, darlin'?"
00:34:49.629,00:34:51.715,All right.
00:34:51.757,00:34:53.383,Yeah?
00:34:53.425,00:34:56.553,All right.
00:35:05.645,00:35:08.106,You guys ready for the big game?
00:35:08.147,00:35:09.733,Yeah.
00:35:09.775,00:35:11.735,"Sam, who are the Astros playing tonight?"
00:35:11.777,00:35:14.279,- I don't know.
00:35:14.320,00:35:15.864,Get to know 'em.
00:35:15.906,00:35:17.908,"Mase. How you been, huh?"
00:35:17.950,00:35:19.451,- Pretty good.
00:35:19.492,00:35:21.620,- What you been up to?
00:35:21.661,00:35:23.663,No? You still hangin' with that kid Joe?
00:35:23.705,00:35:25.331,- Yeah.
00:35:25.373,00:35:26.959,"Yeah, I guess."
00:35:28.209,00:35:30.169,Okay. How 'bout you?
00:35:30.211,00:35:33.006,Fine.
00:35:33.048,00:35:34.633,Nothin' really.
00:35:34.674,00:35:39.178,"- You, um-- You still working on that sculpture project?"
00:35:39.220,00:35:41.723,- What's it of?
00:35:43.600,00:35:46.185,"All right. No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:35:46.227,00:35:49.188,"No, that is not how we are going to talk to one another."
00:35:49.230,00:35:52.484,All right?
00:35:52.525,00:35:54.569,You cannot put me in that category.
00:35:54.611,00:35:57.322,The biological father I spend every other week with...
00:35:57.363,00:36:01.200,that I make polite conversation while he drives me places and buys me shit.
00:36:01.242,00:36:03.495,No. Talk to me.
00:36:03.536,00:36:05.497,"Samantha, how was your week?"
00:36:05.538,00:36:07.457,"I don't know, Dad."
00:36:07.499,00:36:09.501,"Billy and Ellen broke up, and Ellen's kinda mad at me..."
00:36:09.542,00:36:11.544,'cause she saw me talking to Billy in the cafeteria.
00:36:11.586,00:36:13.421,Remember that sculpture I was workin' on?
00:36:13.463,00:36:17.216,"Well, it was a unicorn, and the horn broke off, so now it's a zebra, okay?"
00:36:17.258,00:36:19.344,But I still think I'm gonna get an ‘A.' Right?
00:36:19.385,00:36:21.387,"Mason, uh, how was your week?"
00:36:21.429,00:36:23.222,"Well, Dad, you know, it was kinda tough."
00:36:23.264,00:36:26.559,Joey's kind of a jerk.
00:36:26.601,00:36:28.728,"He wanted me to smoke 'em, but I said no..."
00:36:28.770,00:36:30.856,"'cause I knew what a hard time you had quitting smoking, Dad."
00:36:30.897,00:36:32.816,How 'bout that?
00:36:32.858,00:36:34.860,"Dad, these questions are kind of hard to answer."
00:36:34.901,00:36:37.904,What is so hard to answer about what sculpture are you making?
00:36:37.946,00:36:41.158,- It's abstract.
00:36:41.199,00:36:45.244,"See, I didn't know you were even interested in abstract art."
00:36:45.286,00:36:47.246,I'm not.
00:36:47.288,00:36:50.291,"But, Dad, I mean, why is it all on us though?"
00:36:50.333,00:36:54.087,How was your week?
00:36:54.129,00:36:56.715,- What have you been up to?
00:36:59.551,00:37:02.387,"So we should just let it happen more natural, right?"
00:37:02.428,00:37:04.139,That's what you're sayin'.
00:37:04.181,00:37:07.392,Okay.
00:37:20.530,00:37:22.574,"Hey, check this out."
00:37:25.994,00:37:29.998,"That would be, uh-- That would be a Magnificent Owl."
00:37:30.040,00:37:31.875,Caligo atreus.
00:37:31.917,00:37:33.710,What's that one?
00:37:33.752,00:37:35.294,Whoa.
00:37:35.336,00:37:37.630,That looks like a Zebra Longwing.
00:37:37.672,00:37:39.716,All right.
00:37:39.758,00:37:43.053,This one's incredible.
00:37:43.095,00:37:45.346,Yeah. Magnificent Owl.
00:37:45.388,00:37:48.850,"I think he went pee-pee on you, bud."
00:37:50.351,00:37:55.690,"One, two, three, four, five."
00:38:16.335,00:38:18.463,Ah! Ah!
00:38:18.504,00:38:21.258,Get away from me!
00:38:21.299,00:38:23.260,"Hey, hey, hey!"
00:38:23.301,00:38:25.344,"Yo, Mase, look at me here."
00:38:25.386,00:38:28.389,"Make a diamond with your hands, right?"
00:38:28.431,00:38:31.977,Keep your hands soft.
00:38:32.018,00:38:35.272,Very nice. That's how you want to catch it-- just like that.
00:38:35.313,00:38:37.816,"Even when you're runnin', that's what you're thinkin' about-- that diamond."
00:38:37.857,00:38:40.359,That diamond and soft hands.
00:38:40.401,00:38:42.154,There it is.
00:38:44.405,00:38:46.074,Down!
00:38:46.116,00:38:47.325,Set!
00:38:47.366,00:38:48.367,Hut!
00:38:50.245,00:38:51.955,"No, no, no, no, no!"
00:38:51.997,00:38:53.165,Dad! Dad!
00:38:53.206,00:38:55.875,"Don't let her get-- No, no, no, no, no!"
00:38:56.960,00:38:59.545,"Let's go, Roger!"
00:38:59.587,00:39:02.340,Dad?
00:39:02.381,00:39:04.717,Strike!
00:39:04.759,00:39:07.386,Yeah!
00:39:07.428,00:39:10.056,He's unhittable this year.
00:39:10.098,00:39:12.017,"Now just so you know, what we're watching here is history."
00:39:12.058,00:39:13.601,Now you see this guy out here?
00:39:13.643,00:39:18.231,"This dude is like 43 years old, and he's strikin' out guys half his age."
00:39:18.273,00:39:22.527,This guy's E.R.A. is 1.47.
00:39:22.568,00:39:27.157,"Now if the Astros could just get a few runs, maybe we'd win a game."
00:39:27.199,00:39:29.034,"Dad, do you have a job?"
00:39:31.953,00:39:34.080,Why would you ask me that?
00:39:34.122,00:39:37.583,I don't know.
00:39:37.625,00:39:39.585,Mom wanted to know.
00:39:39.627,00:39:45.217,"that I just happen to have passed my second actuarial exam, all right?"
00:39:45.258,00:39:47.426,So...
00:39:47.468,00:39:49.054,How's she doing?
00:39:49.095,00:39:51.139,Is she finishing school?
00:39:51.181,00:39:54.351,"All A's, huh?"
00:40:10.158,00:40:13.411,He got that!
00:40:13.452,00:40:15.288,Oh! Oh!

00:40:52.242,00:40:55.828,"Hey, what's up, Jimmy?"
00:40:55.870,00:40:58.748,Astros won.
00:40:58.790,00:41:02.001,"What, I'm the only one with any arms around here?"
00:41:02.043,00:41:04.545,- Help their old man out.
00:41:04.587,00:41:08.300,"Oh, come on, Jimmy, man!"
00:41:08.341,00:41:12.595,"Can't you just help me out a little bit, just-- - I'm sorry, muffin."
00:41:12.637,00:41:16.557,Don't put me in that position.
00:41:16.599,00:41:18.517,"Dad, it's always a mess."
00:41:18.559,00:41:20.728,"It was not a mess this morning, okay?"
00:41:20.770,00:41:22.563,I mowed the lawn.
00:41:22.605,00:41:25.317,"Oh, yeah? Great."
00:41:25.358,00:41:29.446,"Oh, come on, man!"
00:41:31.572,00:41:33.574,- Did you watch the game?
00:41:33.616,00:41:35.534,Lane won it with a three-run homer.
00:41:35.576,00:41:38.121,"It was beautiful, wasn't it?"
00:41:38.163,00:41:39.956,Sam lost her mind.
00:41:39.998,00:41:42.250,She's a huge Astros fan.
00:41:42.292,00:41:43.918,Sure.
00:42:45.355,00:43:06.418,whispering through - You brush your teeth?
00:43:06.459,00:43:07.835,Did you brush your teeth?
00:43:07.877,00:43:10.505,"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
00:43:10.547,00:43:13.007,- You gonna fall asleep with those things in your head?
00:43:13.049,00:43:15.218,"Yeah, well, try not to, all right?"
00:43:15.260,00:43:18.137,- You want me to turn off the light?
00:43:18.179,00:43:20.557,"- Good night, Sam."
00:43:22.767,00:43:25.228,"Good night, Sam."

00:43:27.146,00:43:30.024,"- That was a fun day, right?"
00:43:31.276,00:43:33.652,- Why?
00:43:33.694,00:43:37.449,Good night.
00:43:42.120,00:43:43.580,Dad?
00:43:45.331,00:43:50.753,"There's no, like, real magic in the world, right?"
00:43:50.795,00:43:52.422,What do you mean?
00:43:53.256,00:43:56.675,"You know, like elves and stuff."
00:43:56.717,00:43:58.595,People just made that up.
00:43:59.720,00:44:02.307,I don't know.
00:44:02.348,00:44:07.520,"I mean, what makes you think that elves are any more magical than something like a whale?"
00:44:09.063,00:44:11.316,You know what I mean?
00:44:11.357,00:44:17.322,"about how underneath the ocean, there was this giant sea mammal..."
00:44:17.363,00:44:24.496,"that used sonar and sang songs, and it was so big that its heart was the size of a car..."
00:44:24.537,00:44:27.624,and you could crawl through the arteries?
00:44:27.665,00:44:30.126,"I mean, you'd think that was pretty magical, right?"
00:44:30.168,00:44:32.629,Yeah.
00:44:32.670,00:44:41.220,"But, like, right this second, there's, like, no elves in the world, right?"
00:44:42.972,00:44:45.475,No.
00:44:57.778,00:44:59.030,"Love you, guys."
00:44:59.071,00:45:00.990,All right. Be well.
00:45:01.032,00:45:04.243,Have a great week.
00:45:04.285,00:45:06.120,All right.
00:45:06.162,00:45:07.955,What?
00:45:07.997,00:45:09.706,A sleepover?
00:45:09.748,00:45:11.750,All right. I'll talk to your mom about it.
00:45:11.792,00:45:15.712,"Don't worry about it, okay?"
00:45:18.799,00:45:20.759,"Oh, man."
00:45:20.801,00:45:22.887,How do you guys not know how to do this?
00:45:24.096,00:45:26.182,I'll make you some bookmarks.
00:45:26.224,00:45:29.602,Choose-- She looks nice.
00:45:34.649,00:45:38.110,"Randy, Mason, Dad wants you guys downstairs."
00:45:38.152,00:45:40.572,- Why?
00:46:02.594,00:46:04.554,This is gonna look so much better.
00:46:04.596,00:46:08.015,You're gonna look like a man instead of like a little girl.
00:46:11.686,00:46:14.689,"You're takin' the eyebrows off next, right, Byron?"
00:46:28.827,00:46:31.788,"Mason, we're leavin'."
00:46:31.830,00:46:34.375,You're not sick.
00:46:43.301,00:46:45.219,"Bye, guys."
00:46:45.261,00:46:47.846,- Where's Mason?
00:46:47.888,00:46:49.848,I don't think he's going to school.
00:46:49.890,00:46:51.392,He's totally faking it.
00:46:51.434,00:46:53.060,Bye.
00:46:57.856,00:46:59.651,"Mason, what's goin' on?"
00:47:03.613,00:47:06.031,I don't feel good.
00:47:06.073,00:47:07.866,So get your ass out of bed.
00:47:07.908,00:47:11.704,I'm gonna drive you to school.
00:47:28.805,00:47:32.767,"I mean, he didn't even ask."
00:47:32.809,00:47:34.560,"I mean, it's my hair."
00:47:34.602,00:47:36.270,No wonder you were angry.
00:47:37.896,00:47:40.065,I look like a Martian now.
00:47:42.943,00:47:46.364,"Honey, you know what?"
00:47:46.405,00:47:49.742,"Yeah, I tried to call you, but you didn't answer your phone."
00:47:49.784,00:47:51.118,I'm so sorry.
00:47:51.160,00:47:53.830,I've been so busy with school.
00:47:54.913,00:47:56.457,Hey.
00:47:56.499,00:48:00.837,"For what it's worth, it's hair, and it will grow back."
00:48:00.877,00:48:03.464,Now I can see your pretty eyes and your foxy face.
00:48:03.506,00:48:07.343,Why'd you even marry him?
00:48:09.512,00:48:12.056,"Well, Bill has his good qualities."
00:48:12.097,00:48:14.851,"You know, nobody's perfect."
00:48:14.891,00:48:16.394,And now we have a family.
00:48:17.311,00:48:19.063,We already had a family.
00:48:29.281,00:48:45.715,"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
00:48:45.757,00:48:48.801,Please join me in the Texas pledge.
00:48:48.843,00:48:50.969,Honor the Texas flag.
00:48:51.011,00:48:56.559,"I pledge allegiance to thee, Texas, one and indivisible."
00:48:56.601,00:48:58.394,Thank you.
00:48:58.436,00:49:00.855,All right.
00:49:03.608,00:49:07.986,"All right, class, as you know, we've been working on our mythology projects."
00:49:08.028,00:49:10.656,We're gonna be writing papers about gods and goddesses.
00:49:10.698,00:49:12.991,We've listed those gods and goddesses here on the board.
00:49:13.033,00:49:16.995,We added a couple of monsters for some of you who might be interested in that.
00:49:17.037,00:49:19.331,You're gonna write your essay about your god and goddess.
00:49:19.373,00:49:23.795,"And to make sure that you cover everything, let's make sure that we do all of these things right here."
00:49:23.836,00:49:27.339,"First of all, we need to name your god or goddess..."
00:49:27.381,00:49:33.805,"and you need to include who, what, when, where, why and how."
00:49:33.846,00:49:37.642,So make sure that you cover all those things when you're writing your essay.
00:49:42.563,00:49:44.607,There's a bump right there.
00:49:56.076,00:49:58.245,"- See you later, guys."
00:50:08.631,00:50:11.383,"Mom, are you okay?"
00:50:11.425,00:50:14.720,What happened?
00:50:14.762,00:50:17.348,Go! Go in the house!
00:50:17.389,00:50:20.058,Your mother had a little accident.
00:50:20.100,00:50:22.186,Now she's being dramatic.
00:50:23.771,00:50:27.483,"Get off the fucking floor, Olivia, for Christ's sake."
00:51:13.153,00:51:14.530,Ah.
00:51:16.699,00:51:18.743,I'm having a drink with my dinner.
00:51:20.786,00:51:23.622,Anybody else have a problem with that?
00:51:23.664,00:51:25.708,Hmm? Samantha?
00:51:25.750,00:51:28.084,No.
00:51:30.254,00:51:33.382,- Mindy?
00:51:33.424,00:51:37.011,I didn't think so.
00:51:47.730,00:51:48.689,Ah.
00:51:48.731,00:51:51.442,"You don't like me much, do you, Mason?"
00:51:54.653,00:51:56.655,That's okay.
00:51:58.574,00:52:00.284,"Think that's funny, huh?"
00:52:02.745,00:52:05.790,- You think that's fuckin' funny?
00:52:08.834,00:52:11.462,What's the matter?
00:52:11.503,00:52:13.547,Oh!
00:52:13.589,00:52:15.841,"Clean it up, goddamn it!"
00:52:15.883,00:52:18.260,- Bill! Stop it!
00:52:18.302,00:52:20.429,I hate squash!
00:52:26.226,00:52:28.395,...on the streets!
00:52:28.437,00:52:33.191,"Pearl, I'm gonna pay you."
00:52:33.233,00:52:35.694,"How many times can you watch that, Mason?"
00:52:35.736,00:52:37.947,It's funny.
00:52:37.989,00:52:41.199,"I'm inside with my buddy right now, goin' over my résumé."
00:52:41.241,00:52:44.120,I'm gonna smack you.
00:52:44.160,00:52:46.705,"Okay, you know what?"
00:52:48.958,00:52:52.086,Why do you need your money so fast? Come on!
00:52:52.128,00:52:54.546,Has he ever gotten this bad before?
00:52:54.588,00:52:56.381,But he's yelled a lot.
00:52:56.423,00:52:59.885,"Yeah, but he hasn't thrown and broken stuff."
00:52:59.927,00:53:02.220,"Yeah, you're drunk."
00:53:02.262,00:53:05.223,You're already drunk.
00:53:05.265,00:53:07.143,Give me your cell phones.
00:53:15.484,00:53:17.903,"So nobody talked to her, huh?"
00:53:27.121,00:53:29.915,- Mason?
00:53:34.210,00:53:36.254,Mindy?
00:53:36.296,00:53:39.299,I believe you.
00:53:43.637,00:53:46.724,- Samantha?
00:53:53.814,00:53:56.067,I didn't talk to her.
00:53:58.318,00:54:01.363,- What'd she say?
00:54:04.158,00:54:05.659,What did she say?
00:54:06.493,00:54:08.328,She said she'd be back later.
00:54:09.872,00:54:11.999,And that's all?
00:54:12.041,00:54:16.294,"She said, Stay in your rooms."
00:54:16.336,00:54:19.715,Be back later.
00:54:19.757,00:54:20.925,Yeah.
00:54:20.966,00:54:23.301,- Where is she?
00:54:23.343,00:54:24.845,- Where is she?
00:54:30.684,00:54:33.604,"All right. Everybody, get in the car."
00:54:33.645,00:54:36.065,Hurry up!
00:54:43.739,00:54:46.324,It's still not working.
00:54:46.366,00:54:48.410,"Oh, bullshit."
00:54:50.579,00:54:53.331,She took it all.
00:54:54.374,00:54:56.334,"All right, Randy."
00:54:56.376,00:55:00.464,Tell 'em I'm not feeling well or something.
00:55:00.505,00:55:03.217,I don't know.
00:55:03.259,00:55:05.886,"Mason, go with him."
00:55:05.928,00:55:08.973,Here. Here's my I.D.
00:55:20.109,00:55:23.319,"Hi. Good afternoon, fellas."

00:55:38.252,00:55:39.628,"Yeah, I know him."
00:55:39.670,00:55:42.965,"Okay, here we go."
00:55:44.049,00:55:47.719,500 bucks.
00:55:44.049,00:55:51.140,"One, two, three, four, 500 bucks."
00:55:51.182,00:55:54.226,All right?
00:55:55.477,00:55:58.939,"Now take care of your dad now, son."
00:56:05.487,00:56:07.572,Damn it.
00:56:07.614,00:56:10.784,Get outta the way!

00:56:32.890,00:56:35.391,Where the hell have you been?
00:56:35.433,00:56:38.354,"- I'm leaving you, Bill."
00:56:38.394,00:56:40.480,"Samantha, Mason!"
00:56:40.522,00:56:43.483,No. Mm-mmm.
00:56:43.525,00:56:45.110,I'm not here for you.
00:56:45.152,00:56:47.612,"Oh, really?"
00:56:47.654,00:56:50.032,"Well, thank you so much, you two."
00:56:50.074,00:56:52.034,Behave!
00:56:52.076,00:56:54.119,Come inside here.
00:56:54.161,00:56:57.873,Get your ass upstairs.
00:56:57.915,00:57:00.458,Come on.
00:57:00.500,00:57:03.379,Get upstairs!
00:57:03.419,00:57:04.588,Stop it!
00:57:04.629,00:57:06.464,Don't touch my kids!
00:57:06.506,00:57:08.424,Go on.
00:57:08.466,00:57:11.803,"Well, take 'em then!"
00:57:11.845,00:57:14.306,Go!
00:57:14.348,00:57:16.267,Get upstairs!
00:57:16.308,00:57:19.770,Olivia!
00:57:31.531,00:57:35.702,- Where are we going?
00:57:37.788,00:57:40.498,Don't look back.
00:57:40.540,00:57:42.584,It's gonna be okay.
00:57:55.931,00:58:03.230,"where we stand Hey, Lee, Mason."
00:58:20.080,00:58:23.334,"Hey, Abby."
00:58:24.501,00:58:27.296,Why couldn't Randy and Mindy come with us?
00:58:27.338,00:58:30.007,"I'm not their legal guardian, honey."
00:58:30.048,00:58:32.134,That would be kidnapping.
00:58:30.048,00:58:34.011,"I can't just-- Well, what's gonna happen to them?"
00:58:34.052,00:58:37.473,What happens when their legal guardian is dangerous and abusive?
00:58:37.514,00:58:39.266,"You know, I don't know, honey."
00:58:39.308,00:58:42.602,I called their mom.
00:58:42.644,00:58:44.438,I have you and your brother.
00:58:44.480,00:58:47.565,We're in a dangerous situation.
00:58:47.607,00:58:50.361,Are we ever gonna see them again?
00:58:50.402,00:58:53.197,I don't know.
00:58:53.238,00:58:54.823,I hope so.
00:58:54.865,00:58:56.741,How much longer are we gonna be here?
00:58:58.785,00:59:06.084,Not long. We're-- I don't-- I don't know.
00:59:06.126,00:59:09.046,I don't have the answer to everything.
00:59:09.087,00:59:12.799,"Hey, listen. We are happy to have you here as long as you want."
00:59:12.841,00:59:15.593,As long as you need.
00:59:15.635,00:59:18.180,"- This is fun for us, isn't it?"
00:59:18.222,00:59:21.641,"Yeah, it's like having a big sister, like having a brother."
00:59:21.683,00:59:23.519,"We're gonna help out, right?"
00:59:23.560,00:59:26.021,You're not even gonna know we're here.
00:59:37.908,00:59:40.202,"Mom, this is awful."
00:59:40.244,00:59:42.913,You're dumping me in some parking lot of the school...
00:59:42.954,00:59:44.622,where I don't even know anyone.
00:59:44.664,00:59:48.210,"I'm leaving all my friends, and I didn't even get to say good-bye!"
00:59:48.252,00:59:52.047,I don't know where to go!
00:59:52.089,00:59:54.174,The office is right there.
00:59:54.216,00:59:56.718,They're gonna give you your schedule.
00:59:56.760,00:59:59.096,I will pick you up right here at 3:30.
00:59:59.137,01:00:01.181,I'm wearing dirty clothes...
01:00:01.223,01:00:04.768,because you wouldn't even let us get our stuff!
01:00:04.809,01:00:07.729,We don't even have a place to live!
01:00:07.771,01:00:09.523,This sucks!
01:00:10.690,01:00:14.027,Samantha!
01:00:14.069,01:00:16.196,And you're right!
01:00:16.238,01:00:21.659,But it doesn't suck half as much as having a drunk fool slam your head against a wall!
01:00:21.701,01:00:25.705,So cut your horseshit attitude!
01:00:32.629,01:00:36.133,"You know, if you need anything, I'm in Room 112, right?"
01:00:36.174,01:00:37.050,Okay.
01:00:37.092,01:00:40.053,This is Mrs. Darby's room.
01:00:40.095,01:00:42.222,"Oh, honey, it's gonna be okay."
01:00:42.264,01:00:43.723,Mom.
01:00:47.727,01:00:49.687,That concert was off the hook.
01:00:49.729,01:00:57.904,"I mean, when he smashed that board against that microphone, I swear, I thought of-- - Are you Mason?"
01:00:57.946,01:01:00.698,Hi. I'm Mrs. Darby.
01:01:00.740,01:01:02.618,Why don't you sit here?
01:01:03.743,01:01:06.204,"- Kenny, off."
01:01:06.246,01:01:07.705,Kenny.
01:01:07.747,01:01:10.501,"This is Mason, and I want you to show him around today, okay?"
01:01:10.542,01:01:11.918,Got it.
01:01:12.794,01:01:15.631,"Hey, dude."
01:01:15.672,01:01:18.008,"Everybody, listen up."
01:01:18.049,01:01:20.385,We have a new student joining us today.
01:01:20.427,01:01:22.720,His name is Mason.
01:01:22.762,01:01:26.724,"Kenny's gonna be his buddy, but I want each one of you..."
01:01:26.766,01:01:28.893,to take the time today to introduce yourselves...
01:01:28.935,01:01:31.313,and welcome him to school.
01:01:31.355,01:01:34.608,Okay? Right?
01:02:03.554,01:02:04.971,What?
01:02:06.181,01:02:08.766,"Oh, hi."
01:02:08.808,01:02:11.978,Do I look like a Barack Hussein Obama supporter?
01:02:13.146,01:02:14.064,No.
01:02:16.191,01:02:18.610,This is private property.
01:02:18.652,01:02:20.904,I could shoot you.
01:02:24.700,01:02:26.076,What a dick.
01:02:26.117,01:02:29.538,He had a Confederate flag on his house.
01:02:29.580,01:02:32.082,Young Obama supporters out on the trail.
01:02:32.123,01:02:35.210,This is great.
01:02:35.252,01:02:37.837,"Um, our dad's a big supporter."
01:02:37.879,01:02:41.925,"I mean, we just got to pull together to get this win, right?"
01:02:41.966,01:02:45.095,Yeah.
01:02:45.136,01:02:48.557,I have these dreams where I'm just kissing him 'cause I just love him so much!
01:02:48.599,01:02:51.059,"He's so cute, isn't he?"
01:02:51.101,01:02:53.061,I made these T-shirts for my kids.
01:02:53.103,01:02:55.188,My mama's for Obama.
01:02:55.230,01:02:57.815,Do you like it?
01:02:57.857,01:03:00.777,Thanks for the sign.
01:03:00.818,01:03:03.238,"Hey, all right!"
01:03:04.822,01:03:06.866,"How many you got left, two?"
01:03:06.908,01:03:08.702,Let's get out of here.
01:03:08.744,01:03:10.828,"Go get that McCain sign, would you?"
01:03:10.870,01:03:13.373,Get the McCain sign.
01:03:13.415,01:03:15.875,Get it! Get it!
01:03:19.421,01:03:21.089,"Good job, buddy."
01:03:21.131,01:03:23.258,"I'm proud of you, Son."
01:03:27.011,01:03:28.846,You guys are gonna get us arrested.
01:03:28.888,01:03:32.976,"I'm a patriot, all right?"
01:03:33.017,01:03:38.022,And what is it that you do at these parties?
01:03:38.064,01:03:42.235,"I don't know. Talk, dance, listen to music."
01:03:42.277,01:03:43.903,Uh-huh. And that's more fun to you...
01:03:43.945,01:03:47.741,"than going camping with your brother and your father, who love you?"
01:03:47.783,01:03:50.201,Yes. Sorry.
01:03:50.243,01:03:52.870,Wow. Is there gonna be alcohol there?
01:03:52.912,01:03:55.957,Probably not.
01:03:55.999,01:03:58.585,Mm-hmm.
01:03:58.627,01:04:00.878,"The parents are out of town, right?"
01:04:00.920,01:04:02.880,Somebody's scored a keg.
01:04:02.922,01:04:05.425,"You guys are gonna have a good time, trash the whole house."
01:04:05.467,01:04:07.594,Right? Am I right?
01:04:07.636,01:04:10.263,- Amy's really responsible.
01:04:11.765,01:04:15.893,- Who's gonna be there?
01:04:15.935,01:04:19.897,"Is, uh-- Is that guy on your Facebook page-- Is he gonna be there?"
01:04:19.939,01:04:24.361,- Who?
01:04:24.402,01:04:26.029,with his hair over his eyes.
01:04:26.070,01:04:31.368,- Garret?
01:04:31.409,01:04:33.077,Probably.
01:04:33.119,01:04:35.121,Probably.
01:04:35.163,01:04:38.166,I learn more about her from her Facebook page...
01:04:38.208,01:04:41.252,than I do from our scintillating conversation.
01:04:41.294,01:04:44.631,- Is he your boyfriend?
01:04:44.673,01:04:47.425,Have you met him?
01:04:47.467,01:04:50.970,- Sometimes.
01:04:52.972,01:04:56.226,You have a boyfriend.
01:04:57.310,01:05:00.104,- Have you heard of Sarah Palin?
01:05:00.146,01:05:03.983,What's the one thing you know about Sarah Palin's 17-year-old daughter?
01:05:04.025,01:05:05.861,She's pregnant?
01:05:05.902,01:05:08.530,What is the one thing that you are not going to be...
01:05:08.572,01:05:10.948,in a couple of years when you turn 17?
01:05:10.990,01:05:13.493,Pregnant?
01:05:13.535,01:05:17.038,"Now, what are the two ways that you can achieve that goal?"
01:05:17.080,01:05:19.708,First is...
01:05:19.750,01:05:21.501,"not have any sex, okay?"
01:05:21.543,01:05:24.421,That's the first way.
01:05:24.462,01:05:26.964,That did not work out very well for your mother and me.
01:05:27.006,01:05:29.760,What's the second?
01:05:29.801,01:05:31.720,You don't have to go to the bathroom.
01:05:31.762,01:05:33.847,Just sit down.
01:05:33.889,01:05:35.599,What's the second way?
01:05:37.559,01:05:39.977,Huh? Has your mother talked to you guys about this stuff?
01:05:40.019,01:05:44.982,"- Oh, Dad!"
01:05:46.484,01:05:49.279,Huh?
01:05:49.320,01:05:51.364,Has she talked about that?
01:05:51.406,01:05:54.492,"- What? Does Garret have a condom-- - Oh, God!"
01:05:54.534,01:05:56.994,What?
01:05:57.036,01:05:59.539,We have to be able to talk about this.
01:05:59.581,01:06:02.626,We can do it.
01:06:02.667,01:06:04.711,It's as hard for me as it is for you.
01:06:04.753,01:06:07.547,"But seriously, I read in an article in the paper the other day..."
01:06:07.589,01:06:15.806,"that said although U.S. teenagers are not the most sexually active, we have the highest rate of teenage pregnancies, okay?"
01:06:15.847,01:06:19.016,Hey.
01:06:19.058,01:06:21.018,Nice to see you.
01:06:21.060,01:06:23.897,"- Um, Tammy, this is my daughter Samantha."
01:06:23.939,01:06:26.065,And this is Mason Junior right here. Tammy.
01:06:26.107,01:06:27.734,Mason Junior.
01:06:27.776,01:06:29.486,Hi.
01:06:29.527,01:06:32.029,Heard a lot about you guys.
01:06:32.071,01:06:34.031,I'm just here with some friends.
01:06:34.073,01:06:35.826,"Oh, wow."
01:06:35.867,01:06:38.244,- What are you guys up to?
01:06:38.286,01:06:40.204,"Well, no."
01:06:40.246,01:06:43.416,- This one is going to a party.
01:06:43.458,01:06:45.460,We-- the men-- are going camping.
01:06:45.502,01:06:48.254,Boys are going camping.
01:06:48.296,01:06:51.048,"Well, uh, are we still on for tomorrow?"
01:06:51.090,01:06:54.469,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:06:54.511,01:06:56.137,All right?
01:06:56.179,01:06:58.515,It was really nice meeting you both.
01:06:58.556,01:07:00.809,Talk to you soon.
01:07:02.686,01:07:05.730,"Don't-- Don't look at me like that, all right?"
01:07:05.772,01:07:08.065,"I just-- Look, just to finish the point, okay?"
01:07:08.107,01:07:12.863,"I was 23 when your mom had you, all right?"
01:07:12.904,01:07:17.074,We didn't put ourselves in the best position to be great parents.
01:07:17.116,01:07:21.621,"And I wish that-- I wish I were a better parent to you guys, all right?"
01:07:21.663,01:07:26.250,And I-I hope that you can learn from my mistakes.
01:07:26.292,01:07:28.336,Okay?
01:07:28.378,01:07:31.339,Oh!
01:07:31.381,01:07:35.010,Whatever.
01:07:38.179,01:07:41.140,"Now, listen to this song, all right?"
01:07:46.187,01:07:49.440,"It's straight up, the lyrics, and it's a straight-up old school country song."
01:07:52.151,01:07:53.904,Listen to the production.
01:07:53.945,01:07:56.155,"The production's like, uh-- like Abbey Road or something."
01:08:03.538,01:08:06.123,"You know, his old woman's gone."
01:08:06.165,01:08:09.794,Nothin' fancy.
01:08:29.188,01:08:31.482,"Yeah, I think she's about to get her master's degree."
01:08:31.524,01:08:34.611,"Well, then she's gonna start applying for teaching jobs?"
01:08:34.652,01:08:37.447,Really? Where?
01:08:37.488,01:08:39.407,All over Texas?
01:08:39.449,01:08:42.201,"Well, if you gotta move, you gotta move, you know?"
01:08:42.243,01:08:45.622,We can handle that.
01:08:45.663,01:08:48.708,"I mean, unless she moves 500 miles away or something."
01:08:48.750,01:08:51.878,It'll just be a little more car time.
01:08:51.920,01:08:54.714,I'm just kinda sick of moving.
01:08:54.756,01:08:57.467,But you never know.
01:08:57.508,01:08:59.469,I'm working for this insurance company now.
01:08:59.510,01:09:01.721,These places get bought and sold all the time.
01:09:01.763,01:09:04.181,"You know, we'll just roll with it."
01:09:04.223,01:09:05.809,I thought you were a musician.
01:09:05.850,01:09:10.396,"I am, but..."
01:09:10.438,01:09:13.149,Guy's got to be responsible.
01:09:13.190,01:09:15.401,What do you think?
01:09:13.190,01:09:19.196,"Hey! You-- Oh, you punk kid!"
01:09:19.238,01:09:21.365,You got no respect!
01:09:25.787,01:09:28.205,You know that redhead at the bowling alley?
01:09:28.247,01:09:30.541,Sure. What about her?
01:09:30.583,01:09:32.209,Do you know her well?
01:09:32.251,01:09:35.546,"Uh, you know, we've hung out a little bit."
01:09:35.588,01:09:38.842,Is she your girlfriend?
01:09:38.883,01:09:40.718,How do you mean?
01:09:40.760,01:09:42.846,"Like, have you kissed her?"
01:09:44.263,01:09:49.811,"Um-- Yeah, yeah."
01:09:49.853,01:09:52.188,What about you?
01:09:52.229,01:09:54.482,Sort of.
01:09:54.524,01:09:59.236,"Really? Have you, uh-- Have you kissed her?"
01:09:59.278,01:10:01.238,Not really.
01:10:01.280,01:10:03.240,Yeah.
01:10:03.282,01:10:05.493,We talked on the phone.
01:10:05.535,01:10:07.704,How'd that go?
01:10:07.745,01:10:10.498,Why?
01:10:10.540,01:10:17.047,"Well, when we're at school, we got plenty to talk about, but when we're alone or on the phone, it's like we have nothing in common."
01:10:17.088,01:10:18.882,Nothin'?
01:10:18.923,01:10:24.261,She's not interested in music or video games or-- Three best movies this summer.
01:10:24.303,01:10:26.430,"Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight and Pineapple Express."
01:10:26.472,01:10:28.391,"Yeah, what about 'em?"
01:10:28.432,01:10:31.268,Okay. What's she interested in?
01:10:31.310,01:10:33.771,Goin' to the mall with her stupid friends.
01:10:33.813,01:10:36.566,"Well, is she cute?"
01:10:36.607,01:10:40.153,Yeah? All right.
01:10:41.946,01:10:44.741,"First off, you gotta ask her a lot of questions."
01:10:44.782,01:10:46.868,"Then you have to listen to the answers, all right?"
01:10:46.910,01:10:49.245,Actually be interested in her.
01:10:49.286,01:10:53.499,"If you can do those things, you're gonna be light-years ahead of all the other guys."
01:10:53.541,01:10:56.211,"Okay, this is the best s'more I ever made in my life."
01:10:56.252,01:10:58.213,Dad.
01:10:58.254,01:11:01.091,"Ah, that's just perfect."
01:11:01.132,01:11:04.594,"Look at that, huh?"
01:11:04.635,01:11:06.888,That's like advertisement worthy.
01:11:06.930,01:11:08.973,Advertisement quality.
01:11:09.015,01:11:11.059,Mmm.
01:11:11.101,01:11:14.478,You think they ever will make another Star Wars?
01:11:14.520,01:11:20.359,"I think if they were to make another one, that the period where the game is set is where it would have to be..."
01:11:20.401,01:11:22.319,"'cause there's nothin' after, really."
01:11:22.361,01:11:26.323,"Yeah. Return of the Jedi-- it's over. There's nothin'-- Yeah, there's nothing else to do there."
01:11:26.365,01:11:29.827,You can turn Han Solo into a Sith lord.
01:12:01.692,01:12:04.195,Good mornin'.
01:12:04.237,01:12:06.197,You gotta pee?
01:12:06.239,01:12:08.365,Yeah.
01:12:08.407,01:12:10.576,Ancient Native American custom.
01:12:10.618,01:12:15.498,"You give back to the Earth what you take from it, and you don't burn the forest down."
01:12:27.969,01:12:30.847,"Okay, guys."
01:12:30.888,01:12:32.974,"Mason, don't forget."
01:12:33.016,01:12:34.892,Sam's gonna pick you up.
01:12:34.934,01:12:37.312,All right.
01:12:37.353,01:12:39.480,See ya.
01:12:45.528,01:12:48.405,Hey.
01:12:48.447,01:12:51.993,Yeah.
01:13:09.802,01:13:12.429,"Don't bump into me, little bitch!"
01:13:12.471,01:13:14.932,- You call me a liar?
01:13:14.974,01:13:17.560,"Don't act like you're tough shit, motherfucker."
01:13:19.229,01:13:21.814,I don't think pretty boy's hair's good enough.
01:13:21.856,01:13:25.484,Hey!
01:13:28.487,01:13:30.573,You're a fuckin' asshole.
01:13:48.507,01:13:51.594,"Hey, Mason."
01:13:51.635,01:13:54.347,"So, where you going?"
01:13:54.389,01:13:55.932,Over to the college.
01:13:55.973,01:13:58.601,What's going on there?
01:13:58.642,01:14:01.687,"Oh, cool."
01:14:01.729,01:14:03.856,"Psychology, I think."
01:14:05.108,01:14:07.902,What are you up to?
01:14:07.944,01:14:09.904,The arts and crafts store over there.
01:14:09.946,01:14:11.697,So I'm just kinda hanging out.
01:14:11.739,01:14:13.699,But I'm supposed to be going to the hospital soon.
01:14:13.741,01:14:17.120,How come?
01:14:17.161,01:14:19.372,Girl with the dyed black hair and the nose ring?
01:14:19.414,01:14:22.917,Wears Hot Topic every day?
01:14:22.959,01:14:27.255,"We used to be best friends growing up, but we've kind of grown apart."
01:14:27.297,01:14:29.506,She sort of got all emo.
01:14:29.548,01:14:31.134,But I still consider her a friend.
01:14:31.175,01:14:32.969,"Anyway, she cut one of her wrists."
01:14:33.010,01:14:35.512,"I don't know how bad, but I think I should go visit."
01:14:35.554,01:14:39.516,So what are you reading?
01:14:39.558,01:14:41.185,Kurt Vonnegut.
01:14:41.227,01:14:44.230,I think my older brother likes him.
01:14:44.272,01:14:46.690,I'm reading To Kill a Mockingbird for the third time.
01:14:46.732,01:14:48.609,My friends make fun of me.
01:14:48.651,01:14:52.196,I think I'm the only girl in the whole school who doesn't like the Twilight books.
01:14:52.238,01:14:54.573,Have you read them?
01:14:54.615,01:14:58.161,"I tried, but it was so cheesy."
01:14:59.578,01:15:01.538,So how do you like San Marcos?
01:15:01.580,01:15:03.374,I like it all right.
01:15:03.416,01:15:07.086,"It's a lot smaller than Houston, but it seems pretty cool."
01:15:07.128,01:15:08.921,Have you always lived here?
01:15:08.963,01:15:13.634,"Yeah. If you want the big city around here, you have to drive to San Antonio or Austin."
01:15:13.676,01:15:15.552,Have you been there yet?
01:15:15.594,01:15:20.641,"I went to San Antonio for a day, but I haven't been to Austin yet."
01:15:20.683,01:15:24.854,That's where all the high school kids go on weekends for shows and stuff.
01:15:24.895,01:15:28.899,That's what I've heard.
01:15:28.941,01:15:31.861,"Um, I think I heard about it."
01:15:31.902,01:15:34.571,"Well, you should."
01:15:34.613,01:15:39.327,"LeeAnn has a big crush on you, and I know she was hoping you would go."
01:15:39.369,01:15:42.497,"You don't have a girlfriend, do you?"
01:15:42.538,01:15:44.123,"Well, then you should come."
01:15:44.165,01:15:46.876,I'll tell Chase to make sure you're there.
01:15:46.917,01:15:49.462,But don't tell LeeAnn I told you that.
01:15:49.504,01:15:51.214,I won't.
01:15:51.255,01:15:54.175,"Well, I better get going."
01:15:57.594,01:16:04.685,"His cognitive series, his interviews with orphans, ethology theorists' work."
01:16:04.727,01:16:07.604,"And then he, in turn, was supported strongly..."
01:16:07.646,01:16:10.066,by Harry Harlow's rhesus monkey study.
01:16:10.107,01:16:14.195,"You guys, you gotta think, this is the 1950s."
01:16:14.237,01:16:20.910,"This flew in the face of traditional learning theory, of B.F. Skinner's classical and instrumental conditioning."
01:16:20.951,01:16:25.622,"Now, Bowlby's gonna argue that human survival..."
01:16:25.664,01:16:28.625,depends on us falling in love.
01:16:28.667,01:16:35.508,"It depends on me falling in love with my mother, and my mother falling in love with me."
01:16:35.550,01:16:39.762,"And if that doesn't happen, we're pretty much doomed."
01:16:39.803,01:16:41.972,Now think about it.
01:16:42.014,01:16:45.184,A tiger chases her tribe out of a cave.
01:16:45.226,01:16:50.647,"Now, an ideal mother My baby! I love you!"
01:16:50.689,01:16:54.860,Or Why am I gonna pick you up?
01:16:54.902,01:16:57.530,tiger kibble.
01:16:59.365,01:17:02.993,So next week we are gonna get into Bowlby's four stages of attachment.
01:17:03.035,01:17:14.088,"Oh, oh, uh, Professor Douglas and I-- Some of you might have classes with Elena-- She and I are hosting a little pre-Thanksgiving get-together at my place, so if anyone wants to come, please stop by."
01:17:14.130,01:17:16.591,I'm not the greatest cook.
01:17:18.717,01:17:20.386,"Thanks, honey."
01:17:27.143,01:17:28.561,Samantha!
01:17:30.271,01:17:32.856,Why the hell didn't you pick up your brother like you said you would?
01:17:32.898,01:17:34.858,"Mom, I know what you're gonna say."
01:17:34.900,01:17:37.612,"She was running late, and we couldn't turn around."
01:17:37.653,01:17:39.155,"No, no! No excuses!"
01:17:39.196,01:17:41.698,The bottom line is you didn't do what you said you were gonna do.
01:17:41.740,01:17:43.159,You stranded your brother.
01:17:43.200,01:17:45.953,It's embarrassing to ask my friend to turn around...
01:17:45.995,01:17:48.789,and go get some kid at the middle school.
01:17:48.831,01:17:51.501,What do you mean some kid?
01:17:51.542,01:17:53.628,And you know what?
01:17:53.669,01:17:56.631,She lives right around the corner.
01:17:56.672,01:17:57.923,Sorry.
01:17:57.965,01:17:59.716,"You know what, Samantha?"
01:17:59.758,01:18:02.845,You need to start thinking long and hard about who you want to be.
01:18:02.886,01:18:05.389,Do you want to be a cooperative person...
01:18:05.431,01:18:10.727,"who's compassionate and helps people out, or do you want to be a self-centered narcissist?"
01:18:10.769,01:18:14.064,You know what? You're right.
01:18:14.106,01:18:16.817,"But honestly, he's not a baby anymore."
01:18:16.859,01:18:18.735,You don't have to treat him like one.
01:18:18.777,01:18:21.947,"He's in eighth grade, and he can find his way home if he wants to."
01:18:21.989,01:18:24.450,You know what?
01:18:24.492,01:18:27.495,"When Gabi leaves, you and me are gonna have a chat."
01:18:30.080,01:18:32.958,Awkward.
01:18:33.000,01:18:34.918,"Dude, that sucks."
01:18:42.801,01:18:45.846,"Hey, man. What's up?"
01:18:45.888,01:18:47.764,You in?
01:18:47.806,01:18:50.809,"My brother, one of his friends and Tony... maybe."
01:18:51.810,01:18:54.021,"Yeah, let me check with my mom."
01:18:55.814,01:18:58.442,"Hey, Mom."
01:18:58.484,01:19:00.110,Camping? Where?
01:19:00.152,01:19:03.113,"Uh, at that house that his family's building."
01:19:03.155,01:19:05.782,"Well, will any adults be there?"
01:19:05.824,01:19:07.826,His brother's a senior.
01:19:07.868,01:19:10.037,- You have your cell phone?
01:19:10.079,01:19:11.788,Is it charged?
01:19:11.830,01:19:15.418,"Okay, do me a favor."
01:19:15.459,01:19:17.753,Okay.
01:19:19.129,01:19:22.132,Yeah! That's what I'm talkin' about!
01:19:22.174,01:19:24.009,You ready?
01:19:24.051,01:19:26.011,"That was all right, but this is gonna be badass."
01:19:26.053,01:19:28.556,"All right, let me see-- Let me see what you can do."
01:19:28.598,01:19:33.060,This is your face.
01:19:33.102,01:19:36.230,"Oh, shit!"
01:19:36.272,01:19:38.982,Shit.
01:19:39.024,01:19:41.652,You might want to move.
01:19:42.695,01:19:44.697,Oh!
01:19:44.739,01:19:49.493,Ow! That'd be painful.
01:19:49.535,01:19:50.953,Oh.
01:19:52.871,01:19:55.791,"Check this out, man."
01:19:55.832,01:19:59.295,Whoa!
01:19:59.336,01:20:02.381,- That shit's lethal.
01:20:02.423,01:20:04.841,"Man, have a beer, man."
01:20:04.883,01:20:07.762,"- It's beer-30, children."
01:20:09.263,01:20:11.807,"- Aw, no, thanks."
01:20:11.848,01:20:14.393,"What are you, a pussy?"
01:20:14.435,01:20:16.771,"No, I just don't feel like drinking a beer right now."
01:20:16.812,01:20:21.858,"Man, if you're too chickenshit to even have a beer, I know for a fact that you have never gotten any pussy."
01:20:21.900,01:20:23.986,- Like you guys have.
01:20:24.027,01:20:26.113,Sure have.
01:20:26.155,01:20:28.574,- Last summer.
01:20:28.616,01:20:32.578,It was awesome.
01:20:32.620,01:20:35.080,- At least that's what he said.
01:20:35.122,01:20:36.873,Bullshit.
01:20:36.915,01:20:40.670,At Tobler's house.
01:20:40.711,01:20:44.674,"Oh, man, his first piece of ass was sloppy seconds."
01:20:44.715,01:20:47.050,"What about you, Mason?"
01:20:47.092,01:20:49.804,"Yeah, you ever made her howl into the night?"
01:20:49.845,01:20:51.764,A few times.
01:20:51.806,01:20:53.890,- Really?
01:20:53.932,01:20:55.685,"What was her name, Lucky?"
01:20:57.311,01:20:58.979,No.
01:20:59.021,01:21:01.023,Jennifer.
01:21:01.064,01:21:03.484,- She's back in Houston.
01:21:03.526,01:21:05.528,I don't care if you assholes believe me or not.
01:21:05.569,01:21:10.366,"Let me guess-- you were pulling all kinds of ass back home, but once you got down here, lefty."
01:21:10.407,01:21:13.452,"Hey, fuck you."
01:21:13.494,01:21:16.288,"Dude, it's not what they want, man."
01:21:16.330,01:21:18.915,- True dat.
01:21:18.957,01:21:22.712,- Join a band.
01:21:22.753,01:21:24.129,"Fuck yeah, dude."
01:21:24.171,01:21:25.922,You don't even have to play that well.
01:21:25.964,01:21:30.720,"Start playing your instrument, and they line up to give you blow jobs. Except for you."
01:21:30.761,01:21:33.430,Doesn't impress the ladies so much when you play flute for the marching band.
01:21:33.472,01:21:35.474,I'm not in the fucking marching band.
01:21:35.516,01:21:38.602,"Oh, dude, you sure?"
01:21:38.644,01:21:40.354,All right. I got a question for you guys.
01:21:40.396,01:21:44.775,"If you think you're so cool, why are you hanging out with a bunch of eighth graders on a Friday night?"
01:21:44.817,01:21:46.777,"Hey, fuck you, you little penis wrinkle."
01:21:46.819,01:21:49.446,You're lucky to even be here.
01:21:49.488,01:21:51.824,The only reason you little cum gums are here is because...
01:21:51.866,01:21:57.246,"fucking Charlie's mom made him bring his little asshole brother, and then he drags along you little dice danglers."
01:21:57.287,01:21:59.456,Fuckin' fuzz nut talking shit!
01:21:59.498,01:22:03.753,"It's all good, man."
01:22:03.794,01:22:06.505,- We got some whores coming by later.
01:22:06.547,01:22:09.675,- Hell yeah!
01:22:09.717,01:22:12.010,I've seen this kid mount boulders before.
01:22:12.052,01:22:14.471,What about you guys?
01:22:14.513,01:22:17.558,- Whatever.
01:22:17.600,01:22:20.352,"What about you, Peter Puffer?"
01:22:20.394,01:22:23.980,- Maybe.
01:22:24.022,01:22:26.275,"Just, you know, sleep over there."
01:22:27.150,01:22:29.403,I'm not gay.
01:22:29.445,01:22:31.988,"- Give it some time, man."
01:22:32.030,01:22:34.408,"See, that's exactly my point, man."
01:22:34.450,01:22:36.993,"Nah, we don't have whores coming over."
01:22:37.035,01:22:39.830,We were just fucking with you to see what you'd say.
01:22:39.872,01:22:41.998,- And you just earned your vage badge.
01:22:42.040,01:22:43.626,Put it next to your bitch card.
01:22:43.667,01:22:45.335,"Yeah, 'cause, you know, you're a bitch."
01:22:45.377,01:22:48.004,"Now hold this like the bitch you are, bitch."
01:22:48.046,01:22:51.842,All right.
01:22:53.928,01:22:55.471,Oh!
01:23:00.976,01:23:02.436,Okay.
01:23:05.021,01:23:07.190,"Hey, you guys made it."
01:23:07.232,01:23:11.027,"Oh, there you are."
01:23:11.069,01:23:13.029,"And here you go, hostess."
01:23:13.071,01:23:16.158,"Oh, thank you."
01:23:16.199,01:23:18.327,"Oh, that's cool."
01:23:18.368,01:23:20.621,You did that?
01:23:20.663,01:23:22.331,Wow.
01:23:22.372,01:23:24.625,How long have you been doing that for?
01:23:24.667,01:23:27.586,"Um, I went to this camp thing just this past summer."
01:23:27.628,01:23:30.046,They have a camp for graffiti?
01:23:30.088,01:23:32.299,"Well, they call it urban art-- Oh."
01:23:32.341,01:23:34.343,"so it sounds, you know, less illegal."
01:23:34.384,01:23:37.763,But it's only just a way to get free spray paint.
01:23:37.805,01:23:42.852,Cool. So is this your tag?
01:23:37.805,01:23:45.855,"Is that-- They still call it-- Yeah, but you know, it's just letters that I'm good at writing."
01:23:45.896,01:23:50.943,It's good. K-- E.
01:23:49.107,01:23:53.028,E-- Z-J-O.
01:23:53.069,01:23:55.489,Kezjo.
01:23:55.531,01:23:57.658,It doesn't really mean anything though.
01:24:00.494,01:24:03.246,- Is that your dad?
01:24:03.288,01:24:05.791,- Where's he live?
01:24:05.833,01:24:07.584,You get to see him much?
01:24:07.626,01:24:11.380,"Yeah. You know, some weekends and over the summer."
01:24:11.421,01:24:13.674,"So, you're a student of my mom's, right?"
01:24:13.716,01:24:17.803,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, she's, um-- I got one class with her."
01:24:17.845,01:24:19.555,"Yeah, she's cool."
01:24:19.596,01:24:22.140,How's she doing?
01:24:22.182,01:24:23.809,Yeah. She's great.
01:24:23.851,01:24:27.103,"She's super smart and she cares, you know."
01:24:27.145,01:24:28.689,She makes it interesting.
01:24:28.731,01:24:32.108,She's probably even my favorite teacher.
01:24:32.150,01:24:34.570,"So, anyway, we figured out a way..."
01:24:34.611,01:24:37.865,to rig up our iPods to the external speakers on the A.S.V.
01:24:37.907,01:24:42.619,"So every time we come rolling into town, you knew the 456 was there 'cause we were bumping House of Pain."
01:24:42.661,01:24:45.121,"It was like, Jump around, jump around."
01:24:45.163,01:24:46.540,The whole family's coming outside.
01:24:46.582,01:24:50.627,"You got the kids and the mom and the dad, and they're all bouncing up and down."
01:24:50.669,01:24:52.546,We're throwing out candies for the kids...
01:24:52.588,01:25:01.638,"and soccer balls and Beanie Babies and Frisbees, um, smokes for the adults, and, uh, they loved-- they absolutely loved Gatorade."
01:25:01.680,01:25:04.725,"But for some reason, you know, they hated the lemon lime flavor."
01:25:04.767,01:25:08.144,I don't know what it was.
01:25:08.186,01:25:13.650,- How long were you over there?
01:25:13.692,01:25:15.193,Wow.
01:25:15.235,01:25:17.571,- Did you enlist?
01:25:17.613,01:25:20.490,"I was, um, Army National Guard."
01:25:20.532,01:25:24.160,"And, uh, you know, coming straight out of high school, needed money for college."
01:25:24.202,01:25:26.956,Seemed like a decent-paying job.
01:25:26.997,01:25:31.710,"And whenever I got done, I told them if there's a world-changing event, I'll come back."
01:25:31.752,01:25:36.172,"And, uh, three months later, 9/11 happened, and I was back 9/12."
01:25:36.214,01:25:43.138,"And I'm proud to say the 456, the whole time we were there, we never lost a guy, not one casualty."
01:25:43.179,01:25:44.765,But is that odd?
01:25:44.807,01:25:46.266,Yeah.
01:25:46.308,01:25:48.852,Almost impossible.
01:25:48.894,01:25:53.732,"Like the guys that came along after us and replaced us, they didn't listen to any of our advice."
01:25:53.774,01:25:59.488,"They, you know, did basically the polar opposite of what we did, and they lost seven guys in the first month."
01:25:59.529,01:26:03.867,Wow. What did you guys do differently?
01:26:03.909,01:26:07.997,"Well, I'd like to think it's just a matter of mutual respect, you know."
01:26:08.038,01:26:14.210,"All the time we spent over there building trust, these guys basically destroyed it in three days."
01:26:14.252,01:26:16.254,So what did the locals think about why we're there?
01:26:17.631,01:26:20.926,Oil. Plain and simple.
01:27:10.851,01:27:13.645,"Hey, Mason."
01:27:21.111,01:27:23.697,Hey. Mickey Mouse Club.
01:27:23.739,01:27:25.741,Get the fuck out of my car.
01:27:25.782,01:27:28.660,"Just crawl out the back window or something, man."
01:27:35.333,01:27:37.627,I'm gonna miss you.
01:27:37.669,01:27:39.379,I'll see you on Sunday night.
01:27:39.421,01:27:41.548,All right.
01:27:44.342,01:27:46.636,Mm. Do you have any gum?
01:27:46.678,01:27:49.806,"Um-- Yeah, I do, actually."
01:27:49.848,01:27:52.142,Here you go.
01:27:54.394,01:27:56.063,And they're buying this party line...
01:27:56.105,01:28:01.026,"that they're supposed to feel bad and trade off their own pension, as if that's what's been corrupting this nation."
01:28:01.068,01:28:03.946,"who hear Fox, in my opinion, are being lied to."
01:28:03.987,01:28:07.323,"Yeah, thank God for Wisconsin."
01:28:07.365,01:28:08.867,You're right.
01:28:10.786,01:28:13.956,"Hey, Mason."
01:28:13.997,01:28:16.166,"Uh, like 12:15."
01:28:17.000,01:28:18.334,Happy birthday.
01:28:18.376,01:28:20.837,Happy birthday!
01:28:20.879,01:28:24.507,"Mason, it's your birthday?"
01:28:24.549,01:28:26.342,"Uh, just now, I guess."
01:28:26.384,01:28:28.344,"- Yeah, how old are you?"
01:28:28.386,01:28:29.846,Fifteen.
01:28:29.888,01:28:33.142,Give me a hug.
01:28:33.183,01:28:35.269,"Oh, my goodness."
01:28:35.310,01:28:36.770,Hey.
01:28:37.646,01:28:39.314,Have you-- Have you been drinking?
01:28:40.440,01:28:43.401,Have you?
01:28:43.443,01:28:46.488,Have you?
01:28:46.529,01:28:51.367,Have you been-- A little bit.
01:28:51.409,01:28:53.495,Oh.
01:28:53.536,01:28:56.331,"Oh, okay."
01:28:58.875,01:29:00.961,"Talk in the morning, huh?"
01:29:02.087,01:29:04.131,"Hey, Dad."
01:29:04.173,01:29:05.924,How you doing?
01:29:05.966,01:29:08.260,Whose car is that?
01:29:08.302,01:29:10.386,Hop on in there.
01:29:10.428,01:29:12.388,"Hey, sweetie."
01:29:12.430,01:29:14.016,Aw.
01:29:14.057,01:29:16.601,"Hey, Cooper. Hey."
01:29:16.643,01:29:18.394,How's it going?
01:29:18.436,01:29:20.230,"Hello, little brother."
01:29:20.272,01:29:21.690,He's so cute.
01:29:21.731,01:29:23.692,Can we just replace that part of the pipe?
01:29:23.733,01:29:26.402,"No. No, it's-it's no good."
01:29:26.444,01:29:29.239,- ¿Todo? ¿Total?
01:29:29.281,01:29:31.407,¿Ya ve? Se quiebra.
01:29:31.449,01:29:33.409,Mira. Párate ahí para que vea.
01:29:33.451,01:29:37.873,This one is-- - Gusto. It's stronger-- - Yes. It's better.
01:29:37.914,01:29:40.876,"Hey, listen, thanks for that camera you got Mason."
01:29:40.917,01:29:43.128,"Oh, yeah."
01:29:43.170,01:29:45.421,He's all into the photography thing right now.
01:29:45.463,01:29:48.591,He's actually talking about turning his closet into a darkroom.
01:29:48.633,01:29:51.011,The red light and developing-- the whole bit.
01:29:51.053,01:29:53.429,You all right with that?
01:29:53.471,01:29:55.891,Yeah. Right.
01:29:55.932,01:29:58.268,At least he's focused on something.
01:29:58.310,01:30:00.270,That's what I like.
01:30:00.312,01:30:02.438,"Okay, let's go grande."
01:30:02.480,01:30:05.025,It's good?
01:30:05.067,01:30:07.610,Mira. Agarra la pipa y la caja y vamos a hacer todo.
01:30:07.652,01:30:09.238,Claro.
01:30:10.488,01:30:13.449,"Hey, you know, you're smart."
01:30:13.491,01:30:16.452,I like school.
01:30:16.494,01:30:19.455,But it's hard.
01:30:19.497,01:30:21.875,Go to night school at community college.
01:30:21.917,01:30:23.501,It's-It's pretty affordable.
01:30:23.543,01:30:25.879,You're doing a nice job with the house though.
01:30:25.921,01:30:27.130,Thanks.
01:30:27.172,01:30:29.341,Yeah. Some fix-its here and there.
01:30:29.383,01:30:32.928,"We got a good deal on the foreclosure, so now I'm finding out why."
01:30:32.969,01:30:34.470,"Yeah, right."
01:30:34.512,01:30:36.514,"Hey. Happy birthday, huh?"
01:30:36.556,01:30:38.474,What's that?
01:30:38.516,01:30:40.434,Get in it.
01:30:40.476,01:30:42.187,"All right, have a good weekend."
01:30:42.229,01:30:43.479,Hey.
01:30:43.521,01:30:45.399,Hi.
01:30:45.439,01:30:47.276,Good to see you.
01:30:47.317,01:30:48.777,Hey.
01:30:48.818,01:30:52.197,How are you?
01:30:52.239,01:30:55.033,You look great.
01:30:55.075,01:30:57.493,Oh! He's got Mason's nose.
01:30:57.535,01:31:00.038,"Yeah, isn't he cute?"
01:31:00.080,01:31:01.539,All right.
01:31:01.581,01:31:03.083,We got a big drive ahead of us.
01:31:03.125,01:31:05.877,"Bye, Sam."
01:31:05.919,01:31:09.089,All right.
01:31:09.131,01:31:11.758,"Bye, honey."
01:31:26.856,01:31:31.861,"So, this is, like, Annie's car and-- and you drive the GTO?"
01:31:31.903,01:31:33.947,I guess you can't really put a baby seat in that thing.
01:31:33.989,01:31:37.284,"Yeah, no."
01:31:38.285,01:31:41.330,- You what?
01:31:42.580,01:31:44.333,So-- So it's gone?
01:31:44.374,01:31:51.089,"Yeah, some sucker collector from California paid 22 grand for it, which is great 'cause I basically got to pay for this in cash."
01:31:51.131,01:31:53.758,"I only paid 8,500 for that thing way back when."
01:31:53.800,01:31:56.510,"Cars are generally a terrible investment, you know?"
01:31:56.552,01:32:01.099,"Soon as you drive them off the lot, you got a used car on your hands, and the value's only dropping from there."
01:32:01.141,01:32:08.398,"But if you take care of it, you know, and you get lucky and it's a classic, the value starts going up again."
01:32:08.440,01:32:12.444,"Shit, you got guys paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for some Shelby Cobra."
01:32:18.074,01:32:19.826,What?
01:32:19.868,01:32:21.577,You don't remember?
01:32:23.121,01:32:25.999,- Remember what?
01:32:28.626,01:32:31.505,You said that was gonna be my car when I turned 16.
01:32:31.545,01:32:33.048,What?
01:32:33.089,01:32:35.800,"No, I didn't."
01:32:35.842,01:32:43.599,"I was in third grade, and you were taking me over to Anthony Nagar's house for his birthday, and we were there early, so we gave him a ride around the block."
01:32:43.641,01:32:47.854,"He was talking about how much he loved your car, and you were all like, This is gonna be Mason's when he turns 16."
01:32:47.896,01:32:52.526,"What are you-- First off, I have no memory of that, all right?"
01:32:52.566,01:32:55.278,"Second of all, I would never say that."
01:32:55.320,01:32:57.406,You did though.
01:32:57.447,01:32:59.908,What-- Mason.
01:33:01.493,01:33:03.703,What about your sister?
01:33:03.745,01:33:05.788,"Come on, how's that fair?"
01:33:05.830,01:33:08.624,Huh?
01:33:05.830,01:33:12.586,"Anthony Nagar. What-- Are you-- Oh, come on."
01:33:13.463,01:33:24.724,"I mean, you're not-- Look, you can sit there like there's a death in the family, but bottom line is that was my car."
01:33:24.766,01:33:28.270,"I paid for it, I took care of it, and I can do whatever I want with it."
01:33:28.311,01:33:29.729,All right?
01:33:29.771,01:33:34.234,"I'm sorry if you had other ideas about it, but when you get older, you can save up and buy a car of your own..."
01:33:34.276,01:33:36.361,and be cool like I used to be.
01:33:37.820,01:33:40.990,Or... you can get a minivan.
01:33:47.997,01:33:50.666,We're gonna make you swim out of here...
01:33:50.708,01:33:52.961,in your own blood.
01:33:54.796,01:33:57.591,Does your mom actually let you watch this?
01:33:57.631,01:33:59.134,Yeah. She likes it too.
01:34:00.718,01:34:02.304,"Oh, my God."
01:34:08.726,01:34:10.686,Okay. Well-- Yeah.
01:34:10.728,01:34:12.688,Have you ever seen her in concert?
01:34:12.730,01:34:15.191,No. But she's coming to Houston in April.
01:34:15.233,01:34:16.776,She's coming to Houston?
01:34:16.818,01:34:20.113,Your dad and I could get you tickets and you can stay with us.
01:34:20.155,01:34:22.574,- That'd be great.
01:34:25.160,01:34:26.702,"Hey, hey, Annie?"
01:34:26.744,01:34:29.705,Will you get me the little birthday present for Mason?
01:34:29.747,01:34:31.291,"Yeah, babe."
01:34:31.333,01:34:34.794,"This one-- This one needs a little explanation, okay?"
01:34:34.836,01:34:36.463,Open it up.
01:34:37.506,01:34:40.716,I call that the Beatles' Black Album.
01:34:40.758,01:34:46.640,"What it is is the best of John, Paul, George and Ringo solo, post-breakup."
01:34:46.680,01:34:48.183,Thanks.
01:34:48.224,01:34:50.393,"Yeah, basically, I put the band back together for you."
01:34:50.435,01:34:53.938,"Whenever you listen to too much of the solo stuff, it kind of becomes a drag, you know?"
01:34:53.980,01:35:00.236,"But you put 'em next to each other, right, and they start to elevate each other, and then you can hear it."
01:35:00.278,01:35:02.280,Ah. It's the Beatles.
01:35:02.322,01:35:05.908,I don't know.
01:35:05.950,01:35:07.701,It doesn't matter.
01:35:07.743,01:35:09.745,There is no favorite Beatle.
01:35:09.787,01:35:11.747,That's what I'm saying.
01:35:11.789,01:35:16.378,"That's what made them the greatest fucking rock band in the world, okay?"
01:35:16.419,01:35:19.713,And there's this decade of music out there that's been scattered.
01:35:19.755,01:35:24.052,"And now it has been carefully found, arranged and ordered for you..."
01:35:24.093,01:35:25.761,by your loving father.
01:35:25.803,01:35:29.015,Very arranged and very organized over and over again...
01:35:29.057,01:35:31.226,by your loving father.
01:35:31.267,01:35:33.269,"So, I mean, look at that-- look at that."
01:35:33.311,01:35:36.772,"Top of volume II, first four tracks, you've got Band on the Run..."
01:35:36.814,01:35:39.568,"into My Sweet Lord, into Jealous Guy, into Photograph."
01:35:39.609,01:35:42.571,"I mean, come on, it's like the perfect segue."
01:35:42.612,01:35:54.916,"You got Paul, who takes you to the party, George who talks to you about God, John who says no, it's about love and pain, and then Ringo who just says hey, can't we enjoy what we have while we have it?"
01:35:54.957,01:35:57.627,It's a good record.
01:35:57.669,01:35:59.170,Cool.
01:36:25.154,01:36:26.780,"Hey there, Cliff."
01:36:26.822,01:36:29.659,"Hey, how you doin'?"
01:36:29.701,01:36:32.828,It's good to see you.
01:36:32.870,01:36:35.831,You made it all right.
01:36:35.873,01:36:37.417,"How are you, darlin'?"
01:36:37.459,01:36:39.835,"All right, we ready?"
01:36:39.877,01:36:42.130,Wait.
01:36:42.171,01:36:44.633,"Hey, Sam."
01:36:44.674,01:36:46.092,Come on.
01:36:46.134,01:36:47.927,"Hey, still sleeping here?"
01:36:47.969,01:36:49.845,"Oh, yeah."
01:36:49.887,01:36:51.847,Sawin' logs.
01:37:13.244,01:37:14.996,Make a wish.
01:37:16.247,01:37:19.208,Hey!
01:37:19.250,01:37:21.877,Presents.
01:37:21.919,01:37:24.714,would you get us a knife so we can cut this up?
01:37:24.756,01:37:26.215,All right.
01:37:26.257,01:37:27.883,I hope you like it.
01:37:27.925,01:37:33.014,"I heard you didn't have one, so-- It's a Bible."
01:37:33.055,01:37:35.183,Look.
01:37:35.224,01:37:37.435,Wow.
01:37:37.477,01:37:39.729,Look at this. Okay.
01:37:37.477,01:37:42.898,"It's a red letter edition, and that means that everything that Jesus said is in red."
01:37:42.940,01:37:44.693,Thank you.
01:37:44.734,01:37:47.362,All right.
01:37:47.403,01:37:50.490,This one's from us.
01:37:50.532,01:37:53.535,It's not gonna make all your dreams come true.
01:37:53.576,01:37:55.036,Just keep your expectations low.
01:37:55.077,01:37:56.663,"No, no, no."
01:37:56.705,01:37:59.666,"Hey! Come on, right?"
01:37:59.708,01:38:01.917,You need this.
01:38:01.959,01:38:04.713,"And the shirt is blue, and I know you like blue."
01:38:04.754,01:38:06.255,You've got dances and job interviews.
01:38:06.297,01:38:08.633,I'm gonna get it all wrinkled here.
01:38:08.675,01:38:10.134,Mason?
01:38:10.176,01:38:11.969,Uh-oh.
01:38:18.976,01:38:20.645,Pull that off.
01:38:22.480,01:38:24.691,There's a 20-gauge shotgun.
01:38:24.733,01:38:26.359,Wow.
01:38:26.401,01:38:36.745,"My dad gave it to me when I was a little younger than you, and his dad gave it to him, and, well, you're 15 and I'd like for you to have it, all right?"
01:38:36.786,01:38:38.538,"Here, you hold it."
01:38:39.539,01:38:40.956,Yeah?
01:38:40.998,01:38:42.625,Thank you.
01:38:42.667,01:38:46.838,"I'll teach you how to clean it, teach you how to fire it."
01:38:46.880,01:38:49.674,I'll teach you a little bit of safety.
01:38:49.716,01:38:51.967,Now cock it.
01:38:52.009,01:38:54.928,"Now, what you want to do is line up the front sight with the back sight here."
01:38:54.970,01:38:56.556,You see this little V right here?
01:38:56.598,01:38:58.433,"Now, which one you aiming at?"
01:38:58.474,01:39:00.476,The middle can?
01:39:00.518,01:39:03.229,"Now, fire at will, all right?"
01:39:04.313,01:39:06.107,Ho! Whoa!
01:39:06.148,01:39:07.901,"All right, watch out, watch out."
01:39:07.941,01:39:09.819,Whoa. Be careful.
01:39:09.861,01:39:11.362,Ready?
01:39:12.739,01:39:13.656,Pull!
01:39:16.117,01:39:18.286,"Oh, you-you, uh-- you hit a little low."
01:39:18.327,01:39:20.288,"Wait until it gets up high and then shoot, all right?"
01:39:20.329,01:39:22.164,'Cause then it's a better aim coming down.
01:39:25.042,01:39:26.628,"Remember, second trigger."
01:39:26.669,01:39:28.212,Mm-hmm.
01:39:29.756,01:39:31.549,- Ready?
01:39:33.050,01:39:35.010,- Pull!
01:39:35.052,01:39:38.180,Ha! Ha!
01:39:38.222,01:39:40.099,"Well, you nailed it, didn't you?"
01:39:41.058,01:39:42.976,How's that feel?
01:39:43.018,01:39:45.020,"Yeah, it felt good."
01:40:49.377,01:40:52.087,Oh!
01:40:52.129,01:40:54.007,That was-- It was really wonderful.
01:40:54.047,01:40:56.009,Mason demanded we work on it the whole time.
01:40:56.049,01:40:59.094,"- Thank you, thank you."
01:40:59.136,01:41:02.849,We don't know why Thomas wasn't there the first time.
01:41:02.891,01:41:08.563,"But a week later, Thomas comes back and joins the other disciples."
01:41:08.604,01:41:10.732,"They say, Hey, the Lord's alive."
01:41:10.773,01:41:14.318,I won't believe it until I put my finger into his side...
01:41:14.360,01:41:16.863,and I'm gonna see those nail prints in his hands.
01:41:16.905,01:41:21.951,"Phew. About that time, here comes Jesus standing right next to him, okay?"
01:41:21.993,01:41:23.870,And he turns to Thomas.
01:41:23.912,01:41:25.413,Don't you know Thomas felt some shame?
01:41:25.454,01:41:30.418,"He turns to Thomas and says, Thomas, here, stick your finger in my side."
01:41:30.459,01:41:32.587,Look at these nail prints.
01:41:32.628,01:41:37.132,"And Thomas says, My Lord and my God, I believe."
01:41:37.174,01:41:40.093,"And Jesus said, Well, that's good."
01:41:40.135,01:41:44.891,But blessed are those who can believe without seeing.
01:41:44.933,01:41:47.268,It's a lot easier when you can see...
01:41:47.309,01:41:49.604,and feel and touch.
01:41:49.645,01:41:53.649,"But like us, we haven't seen him in the flesh."
01:41:53.691,01:41:57.820,"We haven't felt him in the flesh, but we have experienced him in the spirit."
01:41:57.862,01:42:00.573,At least I have.
01:42:02.199,01:42:03.576,This pond's right up here.
01:42:07.038,01:42:08.748,"Ooh, it's low."
01:42:08.790,01:42:10.750,Yeah.
01:42:10.792,01:42:13.544,My dad could take you fishing next time you're here if you want.
01:42:13.586,01:42:15.004,Nice.
01:42:17.423,01:42:20.217,"Hey, baby."
01:42:22.011,01:42:23.972,I think we're just gonna hang out here for a minute.
01:42:24.013,01:42:26.181,You want me to stay with you?
01:42:26.223,01:42:27.892,You sure?
01:42:33.230,01:42:36.651,"Mason, why are you such a stick-in-the-mud?"
01:42:36.692,01:42:39.070,What are you even talking about?
01:42:39.112,01:42:42.197,"Hey, you guys don't mind coming back here on the 20th, do you, for Cooper's baptism?"
01:42:42.239,01:42:43.658,"No, it's fine."
01:42:43.699,01:42:45.827,Okay.
01:42:45.868,01:42:48.621,"It means a lot to Annie and her folks, you know."
01:42:50.247,01:42:52.291,Were we baptized?
01:42:55.920,01:42:59.924,I wasn't the least bit concerned with the state of your soul.
01:42:59.966,01:43:02.384,"We can do it now, though, if you want."
01:43:02.426,01:43:04.261,"You and Cooper together, you know."
01:43:04.303,01:43:06.221,Dunk your heads.
01:43:06.263,01:43:09.308,"You're not becoming one of those God people, are you, Dad?"
01:43:09.350,01:43:11.226,"And what's that supposed to mean, hmm?"
01:43:11.268,01:43:13.186,I can hear you!
01:43:13.228,01:43:17.232,"Well, I think that shotgun should live at my house, huh?"
01:43:17.274,01:43:19.318,I don't think your mom would love that.
01:43:22.237,01:43:24.907,"Hey, look out, Sam."
01:43:28.285,01:43:30.371,"- Nice, Dad."
01:43:30.412,01:43:33.666,"Still got the goods, hmm?"
01:43:46.261,01:43:48.139,"How long you been in here, Mason?"
01:43:48.890,01:43:50.265,I'm not sure.
01:43:50.307,01:43:51.934,I'm sure.
01:43:51.976,01:43:53.769,All class.
01:43:53.811,01:43:55.771,Did you complete your image diary?
01:43:55.813,01:43:56.981,Not yet.
01:43:57.023,01:44:00.193,Completed your digital contact sheet?
01:44:00.233,01:44:03.278,Not quite.
01:44:03.320,01:44:05.781,Not yet.
01:44:06.824,01:44:09.368,Darkroom time is extracurricular.
01:44:09.410,01:44:13.206,"Technically, you don't ever have to be in here these days..."
01:44:13.246,01:44:15.624,and certainly not until you've completed your assignments.
01:44:15.666,01:44:18.544,- That's the deal.
01:44:18.586,01:44:20.462,"I'm worried about you, Mason."
01:44:20.504,01:44:23.382,Why is that?
01:44:23.424,01:44:27.302,"The images you're turning in, they're cool."
01:44:27.344,01:44:30.305,You're looking at things in a really unique way.
01:44:30.347,01:44:32.265,Got a lot of natural talent.
01:44:32.307,01:44:34.185,Thanks.
01:44:34.227,01:44:39.190,"Yeah, but that and 50 cents will just get you a cup of coffee in this old world."
01:44:39.232,01:44:42.401,I've met a lot of talented people over the years.
01:44:44.070,01:44:47.823,How many of them made it professionally...
01:44:47.865,01:44:52.536,"without discipline, commitment and a really good work ethic?"
01:44:52.578,01:44:54.496,I can tell you.
01:44:54.538,01:44:57.166,I can count it on two fingers.
01:44:57.208,01:44:58.626,Zero.
01:44:58.667,01:45:00.878,"It's not gonna happen for you, Mason."
01:45:00.920,01:45:02.504,The world is too competitive.
01:45:02.546,01:45:06.134,There are too many talented people who are willing to work hard...
01:45:06.175,01:45:09.344,and a boatload of morons who are untalented...
01:45:09.386,01:45:11.097,who are more than willing to surpass you.
01:45:11.139,01:45:14.809,"As a matter of fact, a lot of them are sitting in that classroom out there right now."
01:45:14.850,01:45:17.352,You know what they're doing?
01:45:17.394,01:45:18.938,Which is what you're supposed to be doing.
01:45:18.980,01:45:22.275,But you're not.
01:45:22.315,01:45:24.902,"You special, Mason?"
01:45:24.944,01:45:29.907,"But the things you're talking about, like work ethic or whatever, I feel like I do work pretty hard."
01:45:31.408,01:45:34.954,I spend the whole weekend taking pictures a lot of times.
01:45:36.497,01:45:38.958,"You like football, Mason?"
01:45:40.417,01:45:42.419,Not really.
01:45:42.461,01:45:46.841,That's why I've just assigned you to shoot the football game tonight.
01:45:46.882,01:45:49.969,Okay? It starts at 7:30.
01:45:50.011,01:45:53.055,"I want you to shoot a full card, 300 images."
01:45:53.097,01:45:56.100,"I want 'em sorted, and I wanna see 'em very first thing Monday."
01:45:56.142,01:45:57.726,Okay?
01:45:57.768,01:45:59.561,Wanna know why I'm doing this?
01:46:00.437,01:46:01.939,I guess.
01:46:01.981,01:46:03.649,"Who do you wanna be, Mason?"
01:46:03.691,01:46:06.568,What do you wanna do?
01:46:07.528,01:46:09.197,Make art.
01:46:09.238,01:46:11.532,"Any dipshit can take pictures, Mason."
01:46:11.573,01:46:15.077,Art-- that's special.
01:46:15.119,01:46:17.454,What can you bring to it that nobody else can?
01:46:19.623,01:46:21.416,That's what I'm trying to find out.
01:46:21.458,01:46:23.418,Try harder.
01:46:23.460,01:46:26.755,"Hey, maybe in 20 years you can call old Mr. Turlington..."
01:46:26.797,01:46:32.261,"and you can say, Thank you, sir, for that terrific darkroom chat we had that day."
01:46:34.763,01:46:37.432,Get back to class and do your work.
01:46:49.528,01:46:52.948,"Hey, man."
01:46:52.990,01:46:54.449,Fuck you.
01:46:54.491,01:46:57.870,"I'm just saying, you guys were in there for a long time."
01:46:59.038,01:47:01.165,Just hope he bought you dinner first.
01:47:16.597,01:47:19.308,"Mason, honey, come down for dinner!"
01:47:21.060,01:47:25.231,"Samantha, you didn't post these pictures and their descriptions?"
01:47:25.273,01:47:27.691,Come on. This auction is gonna end on Sunday.
01:47:27.733,01:47:29.651,"Honey, you got to get those posted."
01:47:29.693,01:47:31.486,Why are we even doing this?
01:47:31.528,01:47:34.240,It's like an online junk shop.
01:47:34.282,01:47:37.492,I do. We're what you call house poor.
01:47:37.534,01:47:40.495,Everyone's got to do their part.
01:47:40.537,01:47:42.497,You have to help.
01:47:42.539,01:47:44.541,Who even buys this shit?
01:47:44.583,01:47:46.335,"Hey, Sam, watch your mouth, all right?"
01:47:46.377,01:47:49.630,Don't disrespect your mother.
01:47:49.671,01:47:53.217,"Yeah, and you like having electricity so that you can charge your cell phone?"
01:47:53.259,01:47:56.637,I'm not even gonna be here next year.
01:47:56.678,01:47:59.348,I'm a senior.
01:48:19.118,01:48:20.535,Nice nails.
01:48:21.578,01:48:24.123,"Yeah, some girl did that in sixth period."
01:48:25.582,01:48:27.626,You planning on keeping 'em?
01:48:27.668,01:48:29.837,"Until it comes off, I guess."
01:48:32.256,01:48:36.385,"Last summer it was the earrings, and now the nails."
01:48:36.427,01:48:38.971,"You got a, uh-- You got a purse to go with all that?"
01:48:39.013,01:48:42.308,A lot of guys do that.
01:48:45.602,01:48:54.611,"When I was in high school, having a job, being responsible, being able to afford a car, that was cool."
01:48:54.653,01:48:58.240,"Mason, honey, why don't you get you and your sister some water?"
01:49:30.647,01:49:34.776,"Hey, man, Turlington says to cut the artsy crap and shoot the game."
01:49:34.818,01:49:37.112,So take your lens and point it that way.
01:49:37.154,01:49:40.241,Jesus Christ.
01:49:40.282,01:49:42.201,McCormick's gonna take us to the party.
01:49:42.243,01:49:44.619,We're gonna head out after the game.
01:49:44.661,01:49:46.330,Okay.
01:49:46.372,01:49:48.290,Shoot the game.
01:49:59.134,01:50:00.635,Ow!
01:50:19.363,01:50:21.156,Oh!
01:50:21.198,01:50:22.657,That's what I'm talking about.
01:50:22.699,01:50:25.077,What's up?
01:50:40.717,01:50:43.678,"Hey, what's up?"
01:50:43.720,01:50:45.222,Pretty good.
01:50:45.264,01:50:47.682,How long have you been here?
01:50:47.724,01:50:48.934,I don't know.
01:50:48.976,01:50:51.353,A while?
01:50:53.939,01:50:55.774,I just feel like there's so many things...
01:50:55.816,01:50:59.820,that I could be doing and probably wanna be doing that I'm just not.
01:50:59.861,01:51:01.489,Why aren't you?
01:51:02.531,01:51:05.117,"I mean, I guess it's just being afraid..."
01:51:05.159,01:51:07.702,"of what people would think-- you know, judgment."
01:51:07.744,01:51:13.666,"Yeah. I guess it's really easy to say, like, I don't care what anyone else thinks, but everyone does."
01:51:13.708,01:51:15.710,You know? Deep down.
01:51:15.752,01:51:19.881,I find myself so furious at all these people that I'm in contact with...
01:51:19.923,01:51:22.551,just for controlling me or whatever.
01:51:22.593,01:51:26.054,But they're not even aware they're doing it.
01:51:26.096,01:51:27.515,Yeah.
01:51:28.765,01:51:34.229,"So, in this perfect world where's no one's controlling you, what's different?"
01:51:34.271,01:51:37.399,What changes?
01:51:37.441,01:51:42.363,"I just wanna be able to do anything I want, because it makes me feel alive..."
01:51:42.404,01:51:46.699,as opposed to giving me the appearance of normality.
01:51:46.741,01:51:48.410,Whatever that means.
01:51:49.286,01:51:52.206,I don't think it means much.
01:51:53.915,01:51:56.544,"You're kind of weird, you know that?"
01:51:56.585,01:51:57.794,Yeah?
01:51:59.796,01:52:02.508,Is that a compliment?
01:52:02.550,01:52:04.468,Do you wanna be weird?
01:52:04.510,01:52:08.847,"I don't wanna, like, scare kids at the park or anything like that."
01:52:10.807,01:52:12.142,I really like talking with you.
01:52:12.184,01:52:14.269,I don't usually even try...
01:52:14.311,01:52:17.439,"to, like, vocalize my thoughts or feelings or anything."
01:52:17.481,01:52:21.360,Just-- I don't know.
01:52:23.028,01:52:25.614,"So, why are you trying with me?"
01:52:25.656,01:52:28.367,I don't know.
01:52:29.660,01:52:31.036,I'm glad.
01:52:35.457,01:52:36.791,"Hey, Jim."
01:52:36.833,01:52:38.919,"Uh, sorry I'm so late."
01:52:38.960,01:52:41.422,What time were you supposed to be home?
01:52:42.797,01:52:44.466,I don't know.
01:52:45.634,01:52:50.472,"A while ago like 30 minutes ago, an hour ago?"
01:52:50.514,01:52:52.807,"'Cause, truthfully, nobody even knew where you were..."
01:52:52.849,01:52:54.184,until your sister told us.
01:52:54.226,01:52:55.936,She's been home for a while.
01:52:57.312,01:52:58.939,I'm sorry.
01:52:58.980,01:53:01.734,"Yeah, been hearing a lot of that lately."
01:53:02.984,01:53:06.280,"See, but you don't actually care."
01:53:06.321,01:53:14.829,"You just kind of-- kind of come and go as you please, and you don't care if your mom's upset or what time you gotta be home."
01:53:14.871,01:53:16.873,Is that what's up?
01:53:18.166,01:53:20.835,- I don't know what to tell you.
01:53:20.877,01:53:23.046,"You know, speak up."
01:53:23.088,01:53:25.340,I can't understand a word coming out of your mouth.
01:53:25.382,01:53:32.055,"It's just like-- And I ask you questions, and you just-- Can I just have one day where everyone isn't all over my ass?"
01:53:34.891,01:53:36.602,I'm up your ass?
01:53:38.145,01:53:40.188,This is my house.
01:53:40.230,01:53:44.859,"Now, if you wanna live in my house, then you get home when you say you're gonna be home."
01:53:44.901,01:53:46.861,"You know, Jim, you're not my dad."
01:53:46.903,01:53:49.657,"No, I'm not your dad."
01:53:49.698,01:53:51.408,'Cause I'm actually here.
01:53:51.450,01:53:56.871,"I'm the guy with the job, paying the bills, taking care of you, your mom, your sister."
01:53:56.913,01:53:58.873,Huh? Huh?
01:53:58.915,01:54:00.709,I'm that guy.
01:54:23.231,01:54:26.067,Morning.
01:54:26.109,01:54:30.781,"Hey, which one of you guys used the downstairs bathroom last night?"
01:54:30.823,01:54:33.158,I don't know.
01:54:33.200,01:54:34.951,"That tall guy, what's his name?"
01:54:36.286,01:54:39.790,- Phillip?
01:54:39.832,01:54:41.375,Can Phillip read?
01:54:41.416,01:54:44.127,"There's a big sign on the door that says, Do not use this bathroom. It's broken."
01:54:44.169,01:54:46.213,How difficult is that?
01:54:46.254,01:54:49.466,I don't know.
01:54:53.970,01:54:56.014,I think I'm gonna put the house on the market.
01:54:56.973,01:54:58.933,Why?
01:54:58.975,01:55:00.268,This house is too big for us.
01:55:00.310,01:55:01.936,You're going to school eventually.
01:55:01.978,01:55:03.938,It's too expensive.
01:55:03.980,01:55:07.359,"Well, why did you even buy it in the first place then?"
01:55:07.401,01:55:14.366,"Because I really enjoy making poor life decisions, keeping us on the brink of poverty."
01:55:14.408,01:55:21.956,"I've spent the first half of my life acquiring all this crap, and now I'm gonna spend the second half of my life getting rid of all this stuff."
01:55:21.998,01:55:24.292,Really?
01:55:24.334,01:55:26.754,"Like-- Well, I got rid of a couple husbands."
01:55:26.795,01:55:35.387,"Now I'm gonna get rid of a mortgage, some maintenance, the tchotchkes, the-- the homeowner's insurance, the property tax, the plumbing."
01:55:38.473,01:55:41.976,You know what?
01:55:42.018,01:55:44.312,Simple.
01:55:44.354,01:55:46.231,"Don't be gross, Mom."
01:55:48.442,01:55:50.068,Fine.
01:55:50.110,01:55:52.320,I'll be a poor whore with a big house.
01:55:52.362,01:55:54.948,Is that better?
01:55:54.989,01:55:56.742,Okay.
01:56:01.622,01:56:05.709,"Mason-- Mason, please, don't leave me that dirty dish to wash."
01:56:06.960,01:56:08.378,I do dishes all day.
01:56:08.420,01:56:11.005,"Well, great, honey."
01:56:11.047,01:56:14.008,"Come on, you could do one or two more for your poor old mom."
01:56:14.050,01:56:15.677,Okay.
01:56:15.719,01:56:17.220,Thank you.
01:56:40.076,01:56:41.912,You want one?
01:56:43.288,01:56:45.916,"She didn't even touch them, seriously."
01:56:45.958,01:56:48.585,"I bet you did watch her, you little pervert."
01:56:51.129,01:56:53.006,It's like we're on a date.
01:56:54.090,01:56:56.050,Cheers.
01:56:56.092,01:56:58.720,It's a night of romance.
01:56:58.762,01:57:00.973,"Yeah, except I'm not gonna kiss you."
01:57:02.432,01:57:04.559,I will blow you though.
01:57:12.108,01:57:13.652,Mason!
01:57:13.694,01:57:15.570,We are in the weeds out here.
01:57:15.612,01:57:17.197,I'm going as fast as I can.
01:57:17.238,01:57:21.326,"Oh. Then I must be confused then, 'cause I just saw you chattin' it up with April..."
01:57:21.368,01:57:23.077,when I got a salad bar that needs a refill.
01:57:23.119,01:57:27.081,"I got a six-top, two four-tops I can't use because they hadn't been bussed."
01:57:27.123,01:57:29.459,Enrique is not here.
01:57:29.501,01:57:31.795,"Well, while you're tryin', we're dyin'!"
01:57:31.837,01:57:34.006,What-- What am I supposed to tell my customers?
01:57:34.047,01:57:38.719,"Oh, I'm sorry that your table's got dirty plates on it, but Mason's tryin'."
01:57:38.760,01:57:40.679,At least that's what he told me...
01:57:40.721,01:57:43.807,after he was flirtin' with April and eatin' your leftover shrimp.
01:57:43.849,01:57:47.101,"Now, it is a challenge out there today, I know."
01:57:47.143,01:57:50.104,But I wanna share something with you.
01:57:50.146,01:57:54.317,"I got you pegged for fry cook this summer, and that's a lot more responsibility."
01:57:54.359,01:57:57.779,It's also more money.
01:57:57.821,01:57:59.489,Good.
01:57:59.531,01:58:04.285,"I know you can handle that money, but can you take the responsibility?"
01:58:04.327,01:58:07.581,"I think you can, because I believe in you."
01:58:07.622,01:58:10.250,But I need you on the floor.
01:58:10.291,01:58:13.670,Giddyap.
01:58:18.341,01:58:19.885,"Well, so it's-- it's runnin' okay?"
01:58:19.927,01:58:21.678,That alternator's not messin' up anymore?
01:58:21.720,01:58:24.097,"No, it's fine."
01:58:26.182,01:58:29.143,"Well, you gonna see your sister when you guys are in Austin?"
01:58:29.185,01:58:34.274,"Yeah, she said I can stay at her dorm, which is cool, and I guess her roommate's out of town, so it's no big deal."
01:58:34.315,01:58:36.651,"All right, well, did you apply there yet?"
01:58:36.693,01:58:38.194,Did you get that application in to UT?
01:58:38.236,01:58:41.573,"- Not yet, but Sheena's pretty much in though."
01:58:41.615,01:58:45.953,"Well, if you know that's where you wanna go, you should probably do that early acceptance thing."
01:58:45.994,01:58:48.622,"I mean, seriously, let 'em know you're a man who knows what he wants."
01:58:48.663,01:58:50.373,Yeah.
01:58:50.415,01:58:53.167,A little decisiveness goes a long way in this life.
01:58:53.209,01:58:54.586,Yeah.
01:58:54.628,01:58:56.546,And what about work?
01:58:57.547,01:58:59.257,"Uh, I don't know."
01:58:59.299,01:59:01.175,Today kind of sucked.
01:59:01.217,01:59:05.179,But it's definitely an interesting perspective on the world.
01:59:05.221,01:59:07.015,People are slobs.
01:59:08.600,01:59:12.520,"Well, when people ask me about you, I say to them, Oh, Mason, he's doing great."
01:59:12.562,01:59:15.273,He's got a job.
01:59:15.315,01:59:18.443,"All right, hey."
01:59:19.903,01:59:22.196,Say hi to your big brother.
01:59:22.238,01:59:24.240,"Hey, Annie."
01:59:24.282,01:59:26.868,Can you say bye-bye?
01:59:26.910,01:59:30.204,We'll see you soon.
01:59:30.246,01:59:32.833,"All right, well, be careful when you're driving, all right?"
01:59:32.874,01:59:34.709,Don't be texting.
01:59:34.751,01:59:36.837,All right. Just-- You're Obi-Wan.
01:59:36.878,01:59:40.674,"You're centered, patient. Right?"
01:59:40.715,01:59:42.884,"You watch three cars ahead, two behind."
01:59:42.926,01:59:45.303,"It takes two bad drivers to have an accident, okay?"
01:59:45.345,01:59:47.221,- Okay.
01:59:47.263,01:59:50.224,Tell your sister to pick up her phone or call me back or something.
01:59:50.266,01:59:52.811,- Okay.
01:59:52.853,01:59:54.146,"Bye, Dad."
01:59:56.272,01:59:58.232,"Hey, honey, take this to your sister."
01:59:58.274,02:00:02.236,"- Throw it in the truck, okay?"
02:00:02.278,02:00:04.072,So where is Sheena staying?
02:00:04.114,02:00:05.406,At her friend Emily's.
02:00:05.448,02:00:07.450,Is Emily a real person?
02:00:07.492,02:00:10.704,Yeah.
02:00:13.999,02:00:15.834,"Okay, this is in case of emergency."
02:00:15.876,02:00:19.713,Don't spend it.
02:00:21.131,02:00:22.423,Did you do your homework?
02:00:22.465,02:00:25.135,"Most of it, but I can finish tomorrow night."
02:00:25.177,02:00:28.471,"Honey, 11th grade is really important for college."
02:00:28.513,02:00:29.931,Don't blow it.
02:00:29.973,02:00:31.850,We're going to UT and everything.
02:00:31.892,02:00:33.601,"Oh, don't you want me to come?"
02:00:33.643,02:00:36.563,Come on. Sheena.
02:00:36.604,02:00:40.525,Um-- I'm just kidding.
02:00:42.736,02:00:45.155,Call me when you get there.
02:00:47.281,02:00:49.159,Have fun.
02:00:57.417,02:01:01.755,That sounds to me like just another extreme Mason view of everything.
02:01:01.796,02:01:04.799,Not at all.
02:01:04.841,02:01:07.343,It's like when they realized it was gonna be too expensive...
02:01:07.385,02:01:13.725,"to actually build cyborgs and robots-- I mean, the costs of that were impossible."
02:01:13.767,02:01:17.520,They decided to just let humans turn themselves into robots.
02:01:17.562,02:01:19.313,That's what's going on right now.
02:01:19.355,02:01:21.399,"Oh, right now?"
02:01:21.441,02:01:25.987,"There are billions of us just laying around, not really doing anything."
02:01:27.155,02:01:28.615,We don't cost anything.
02:01:28.656,02:01:33.620,"I mean, we're even pretty good at self-maintenance and reproducing constantly."
02:01:33.661,02:01:40.418,"And as it turns out, we're already biologically programmed for our little cyborg upgrade."
02:01:40.460,02:01:42.462,How?
02:01:42.503,02:01:44.131,I read this thing the other day...
02:01:44.172,02:01:50.428,"about how, like, when you hear that ding on your in-box, you get, like, a dopamine rush in your brain."
02:01:50.470,02:01:52.430,It's like we're being chemically rewarded...
02:01:52.472,02:01:54.891,for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed.
02:01:54.933,02:01:59.104,How evil is that?
02:01:59.146,02:02:02.107,So you deleting your Facebook page is gonna change all that?
02:02:02.149,02:02:05.944,Remember when Trevor deleted his Facebook page last year...
02:02:05.986,02:02:08.029,and everyone just hated him?
02:02:08.071,02:02:09.697,You made more fun of him than anyone.
02:02:09.739,02:02:11.741,I still make fun of Trevor though.
02:02:13.367,02:02:16.370,But it looked like he was so pathetically desperate for attention.
02:02:16.412,02:02:18.331,Or to be different or something.
02:02:18.372,02:02:21.584,That's just 'cause they did that lame story about it in the school paper.
02:02:21.626,02:02:25.338,And then he had to make a big announcement about it when he came back a month later.
02:02:25.379,02:02:27.381,That's the thing though.
02:02:27.423,02:02:30.969,I just wanna try and not live my life through a screen.
02:02:31.011,02:02:34.806,"I want, like, some kind of actual interaction."
02:02:34.848,02:02:38.476,"A real person, not just the profile they put up."
02:02:38.518,02:02:41.395,"Oh, I'm sorry."
02:02:41.437,02:02:43.356,"Yeah, okay, I know you're joking."
02:02:43.397,02:02:47.401,But it's kind of true.
02:02:47.443,02:02:48.987,So what are you really doing?
02:02:49.029,02:02:58.038,"You don't care what your friends are up to on Saturday afternoon, but you're also obviously not fully experiencing my profound bitching."
02:02:58.079,02:03:04.919,"So-- it's like everyone's just stuck in, like, an in-between state, not really experiencing anything."
02:03:04.961,02:03:07.380,It's not an experience.
02:03:07.421,02:03:12.635,"Look, for example, I just got the address of the club where we're meeting them later..."
02:03:12.677,02:03:15.889,so we won't be wandering the streets of Austin lost for an hour tonight.
02:03:15.930,02:03:18.058,"Thank you very much, Facebook."
02:03:18.099,02:03:20.434,And I just texted my mom back.
02:03:20.476,02:03:22.436,"Oh, that's-- that's groundbreaking."
02:03:22.478,02:03:25.190,"She hasn't seen you in, like, 55 minutes."
02:03:26.649,02:03:28.902,"Oh. Oh, my God."
02:03:28.943,02:03:32.864,"Most importantly, Meg's family just got a miniature pet pig."
02:03:34.824,02:03:36.450,Huh.
02:03:36.492,02:03:38.286,"Okay, you're right."
02:03:38.328,02:03:39.662,That is a-- Right?
02:03:39.704,02:03:41.455,"That is a really cute, tiny pig."
02:03:41.497,02:03:43.583,Our lives can go on.
02:03:44.500,02:03:46.127,I want one.
02:03:50.506,02:03:52.384,Nice shot.
02:03:52.425,02:03:55.011,"Yeah, just give the lady at the front y'all's I.D.'s..."
02:03:55.053,02:03:58.098,"and, uh, she should let you in."
02:03:58.139,02:04:00.558,"It's room 206, right?"
02:04:00.600,02:04:03.853,"It's not, like, weird that we're staying there?"
02:04:03.895,02:04:06.147,Have fun.
02:04:06.189,02:04:08.482,How long have you guys been dating?
02:04:08.524,02:04:10.484,About three months.
02:04:10.526,02:04:15.489,"Yeah, we met at a party, and it's been, you know, chill."
02:04:15.531,02:04:17.784,"Yeah, he seems cool."
02:04:17.825,02:04:19.827,Does he go to UT too?
02:04:19.869,02:04:21.495,Cool.
02:04:21.537,02:04:24.665,"He's studying history and, uh, Italian?"
02:04:24.707,02:04:26.918,I think.
02:04:26.960,02:04:29.087,Does he wanna-- Does he wanna teach?
02:04:29.129,02:04:31.339,I think-- I think he's still figuring stuff out.
02:04:31.381,02:04:35.343,"Yeah, he'll figure it out."
02:04:35.385,02:04:37.511,"So, where are you thinking about living when you come here?"
02:04:37.553,02:04:39.513,"Um, I'm not really sure yet."
02:04:39.555,02:04:42.350,We're gonna look at apartments tomorrow.
02:04:42.392,02:04:46.813,"Um, but I know my parents sort of were expecting me to live in a dorm."
02:04:46.854,02:04:49.149,Yeah.
02:04:49.190,02:04:51.525,so it doesn't really matter that much.
02:04:51.567,02:04:54.570,"Yeah, you don't have to listen to your parents after you turn 18."
02:04:54.612,02:04:57.531,"I mean, especially if they're not helping you financially."
02:04:57.573,02:04:59.993,"That's what I figured, yeah."
02:05:00.034,02:05:02.620,"But, I mean, living in a dorm isn't so bad."
02:05:02.662,02:05:04.664,"I mean, especially if it's a coed dorm."
02:05:04.705,02:05:09.543,"I mean, I've never been around, like, so many cute guys at once."
02:05:09.585,02:05:12.339,"Like, college is really fun."
02:05:13.589,02:05:16.426,I'm excited.
02:05:28.604,02:05:30.648,Watch out.
02:05:41.493,02:06:31.918,would be so lonesome leaving tracks I seem to be The last death at the Hoover Dam construction site...
02:06:31.959,02:06:42.554,"was his son, Patrick Tierney, who died on December 20, 1935, exactly 13 years to the day."
02:06:43.679,02:06:46.433,See those sorority girls over there?
02:06:47.975,02:06:50.186,I've just decided...
02:06:50.228,02:06:52.605,"if you delete your Facebook page, I'm pledging."
02:06:53.898,02:06:57.651,"Yeah, in just a few years that's you..."
02:06:57.693,02:06:59.279,and that's gonna be me.
02:06:59.320,02:07:07.245,...inlaid into the terrazzo floors was a star map-- a celestial map of heavenly bodies so accurately displayed...
02:07:07.287,02:07:10.623,that one could chart the procession of the Pole Star...
02:07:10.664,02:07:15.836,"14,000 years into the future, such that future generations upon-- I wonder what his deal is."
02:07:15.878,02:07:18.339,"I mean, he obviously has money to eat here."
02:07:18.381,02:07:22.802,You just said.
02:07:24.596,02:07:26.680,Look at all these people.
02:07:26.722,02:07:29.225,What are they even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?
02:07:29.267,02:07:32.103,What are we even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?
02:07:32.145,02:07:36.232,We know what we're doing here.
02:07:36.274,02:07:38.401,"Hell, yeah."
02:07:38.443,02:07:39.693,"Hell, yeah."
02:07:39.735,02:07:43.656,"You know, by, like, next summer this'll just be our lives."
02:07:43.697,02:07:45.366,Mm-hmm.
02:07:45.408,02:07:50.830,Staying out all night and going to shows-- whatever we want.
02:07:50.871,02:07:53.166,We ever gonna go to class?
02:07:54.292,02:07:55.751,Sometimes.
02:07:55.793,02:07:59.005,When it feels right.
02:07:59.046,02:08:01.715,Only then.
02:08:01.757,02:08:03.593,Anything else?
02:08:03.635,02:08:05.761,Uh-- More queso?
02:08:05.803,02:08:07.430,Mm-hmm.
02:08:11.725,02:08:14.646,"Ah, Jesus."
02:08:14.687,02:08:16.730,What?
02:08:16.772,02:08:18.858,I don't know.
02:08:18.899,02:08:21.735,"I mean, college."
02:08:21.777,02:08:24.989,"I mean, I like the idea of being away from home..."
02:08:25.031,02:08:27.867,and gaining skills and getting better at photography.
02:08:27.908,02:08:29.743,I just-- I don't know.
02:08:29.785,02:08:33.831,I'm not counting on it being some big transformative experience.
02:08:33.873,02:08:35.875,I don't think it's that transformative.
02:08:35.916,02:08:38.044,I just see it as the next step.
02:08:38.085,02:08:39.712,But it's like a preordained slot...
02:08:39.753,02:08:43.049,that's already got your name and number on it.
02:08:43.090,02:08:45.759,I don't think it's the key to my future.
02:08:45.801,02:08:47.345,"'Cause-- I mean, look at my mom."
02:08:47.387,02:08:50.557,She got her degree and got a pretty good job.
02:08:50.598,02:08:52.600,She can pay her bills.
02:08:52.642,02:08:54.394,"Well, I like your mom."
02:08:54.435,02:08:57.438,"Well, I like my mom too."
02:08:54.435,02:09:00.608,"I just mean-- Basically, she's still just as fucking confused as I am."
02:09:01.817,02:09:04.070,Thank you.
02:10:14.890,02:10:17.435,Hello?
02:10:17.477,02:10:21.897,"Um, did, uh-- did Sam tell you we were gonna stay here?"
02:10:23.399,02:10:25.401,No.
02:10:25.443,02:10:30.864,"Um, she, uh-- she said you were out of town for the weekend."
02:10:30.906,02:10:33.785,"Yeah, I was."
02:10:33.826,02:10:35.869,Are you her brother?
02:10:35.911,02:10:38.831,Yeah. I'm-- I'm Mason.
02:10:38.872,02:10:40.625,"Um, this is Sheena."
02:10:41.917,02:10:43.753,Hello.
02:10:43.795,02:10:46.130,"Uh, great."
02:10:46.172,02:10:50.426,"I'm gonna leave my stuff here, if it's okay, and get something to eat."
02:10:50.468,02:10:53.680,- I'll just come back in a little bit.
02:10:53.721,02:10:59.852,"We have to-- We have to get out of here soon anyway, so-- All right."
02:10:59.893,02:11:01.895,Yeah. You too.
02:11:05.024,02:11:07.694,"Oh, my God."
02:11:09.069,02:11:11.489,That was so awkward.
02:11:34.220,02:11:36.889,Mason.
02:11:38.098,02:11:40.434,Congratulations.
02:11:40.476,02:11:42.770,Heard you got a scholarship.
02:11:42.812,02:11:44.647,"Yeah, every little bit helps, you know."
02:11:44.689,02:11:47.024,Yeah. When you gonna go out there?
02:11:47.066,02:11:51.863,"You know, work some more before then, try to save up some money, at least."
02:11:51.945,02:11:54.866,"Yeah, before you have to fend for yourself."
02:11:54.907,02:11:56.409,"Yeah, that's the idea."
02:11:56.450,02:11:57.993,"Well, how are you feeling about it?"
02:11:58.035,02:12:02.540,"Excited, you know."
02:12:02.582,02:12:05.918,"Yeah, kind of that voluptuous panic."
02:12:05.959,02:12:08.796,"Well, it's gonna be good."
02:12:08.838,02:12:10.964,I liked college a lot better than high school.
02:12:11.006,02:12:13.760,"You kind of find your people in college, you know?"
02:12:13.801,02:12:15.177,Exactly.
02:12:15.219,02:12:16.970,"Well, you'll be fine."
02:12:17.012,02:12:18.848,Just follow your heart.
02:12:18.890,02:12:20.266,Thanks.
02:12:20.307,02:12:22.101,Don't forget to floss.
02:12:34.781,02:12:36.990,I just don't get why you're being so fucking childish.
02:12:37.032,02:12:38.910,I'm not being childish.
02:12:38.951,02:12:40.994,You're the one who made it into this big thing by telling everyone.
02:12:41.036,02:12:42.914,I haven't told anyone.
02:12:42.955,02:12:45.999,So Cynthia just magically knows you're going to the prom with this loser...
02:12:46.041,02:12:47.752,even though you're not dating him anymore?
02:12:47.794,02:12:49.086,She's my best friend.
02:12:49.128,02:12:52.005,"Well, your best friend has a big fucking mouth."
02:12:52.047,02:12:54.007,"Well, take it up with her then."
02:12:54.049,02:12:57.177,Why don't you just tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaws she can keep on talking...
02:12:57.219,02:13:01.474,"as long as she includes the truth, which is that we wouldn't be having this conversation..."
02:13:01.515,02:13:04.477,if your college boyfriend weren't out of town this weekend.
02:13:04.518,02:13:07.062,You had already bought the tickets.
02:13:07.104,02:13:09.440,It's just prom.
02:13:09.482,02:13:11.024,I'm just trying to be friends with you.
02:13:11.066,02:13:15.195,"Oh, it's just humiliating."
02:13:15.237,02:13:17.824,Mr. I-Don't-Care-What- Anyone-Else-Thinks-Of-Me.
02:13:17.865,02:13:20.493,Fuck anyone else.
02:13:17.865,02:13:23.203,"I care what I think of me, which isn't much right now."
02:13:23.245,02:13:25.164,King of the pity prom.
02:13:26.999,02:13:28.709,Fine. We're not going.
02:13:28.751,02:13:30.169,Great.
02:13:40.805,02:13:47.269,"Why are we even-- I mean, we both knew this was coming."
02:13:47.311,02:13:49.480,I'm just the one who did something about it.
02:13:49.522,02:13:51.064,"Yeah, fucking some college guy."
02:13:51.106,02:13:52.650,"Oh, fuck you."
02:13:53.526,02:13:55.068,I don't regret anything.
02:13:55.110,02:13:56.946,Of course you don't.
02:13:56.988,02:13:58.990,"You know, it's actually kind of a relief..."
02:13:59.031,02:14:01.492,not to have to be around someone who's so gloomy all the time.
02:14:01.534,02:14:03.828,The world's not so horrible.
02:14:03.870,02:14:06.497,Not everything's some big conspiracy against humanity.
02:14:06.539,02:14:08.582,It's great that you can think that way.
02:14:08.624,02:14:13.713,"You know, I'm sure dating a jock really helps to clear the mind."
02:14:13.754,02:14:17.550,"He's not a jock, okay?"
02:14:17.591,02:14:20.344,We're all going to other schools next year anyway.
02:14:20.386,02:14:22.722,So it's not some super serious relationship.
02:14:22.763,02:14:25.098,Great.
02:14:25.140,02:14:27.100,We're just having fun.
02:14:27.142,02:14:29.102,I bet he's having fun.
02:14:29.144,02:14:30.521,"Grow up, Mason."
02:14:32.690,02:14:34.817,It's not like I haven't been with anyone else.
02:14:36.151,02:14:37.945,Who?
02:14:37.987,02:14:39.613,What do you care?
02:14:39.655,02:14:41.198,Who?
02:14:41.240,02:14:43.200,Does it matter?
02:14:44.284,02:14:46.119,You're the one who brought it up.
02:14:52.167,02:14:53.669,This is pointless.
02:14:54.754,02:14:57.339,Now you're just trying to be an asshole.
02:15:02.053,02:15:04.847,Holy crap.
02:15:04.889,02:15:07.224,than ever sit through anything like that ever again.
02:15:07.266,02:15:10.895,"Well, we never, ever have to."
02:15:10.937,02:15:12.605,"Oh, my God."
02:15:12.646,02:15:14.982,- Give me that.
02:15:15.024,02:15:16.483,Drink up.
02:15:18.903,02:15:20.404,"So you coming out with me tonight, brother?"
02:15:20.446,02:15:22.155,Should be some pretty awesome stuff happening.
02:15:22.197,02:15:25.534,"Nah, dude."
02:15:25.576,02:15:28.161,His friend's playing.
02:15:28.203,02:15:30.372,"God, have fun with that, I guess."
02:15:32.625,02:15:36.378,"Fuck, there's so many cars here."
02:15:36.420,02:15:39.172,"Dude, you will have so much fun."
02:15:39.214,02:15:41.133,Your family loves you.
02:15:41.174,02:15:42.843,You're gonna have a swell time.
02:15:42.885,02:15:45.178,Fuck you.
02:15:45.220,02:15:47.556,"Oh, no."
02:15:47.598,02:15:49.767,"Yes, you are."
02:15:49.809,02:15:53.896,Just-- Do you wanna hurt her feelings?
02:15:53.938,02:15:56.189,"Well, then let's-- let's go get 'em."
02:15:56.231,02:16:00.193,Just for a second.
02:16:00.235,02:16:02.947,"You know, you're in sort of-- you're in enemy territory here."
02:16:02.989,02:16:04.323,We're aware.
02:16:15.250,02:16:16.919,Oh. Look who's here.
02:16:16.961,02:16:18.879,Whoo!
02:16:18.921,02:16:20.798,Hey!
02:16:31.767,02:16:33.185,Get a job!
02:16:36.188,02:16:38.774,"No, no, no, no, wait."
02:16:38.816,02:16:40.233,My hug.
02:16:40.275,02:16:42.277,"Hey, can you get a camera?"
02:16:42.319,02:16:44.279,I don't know you.
02:16:44.321,02:16:47.574,All right.
02:16:47.616,02:16:49.493,Smile.
02:16:49.535,02:16:51.244,"Oh, that's a good one."
02:16:51.286,02:16:53.873,And-- Good.
02:16:53.914,02:16:56.125,"Oh, we need-- Sam, where are you?"
02:16:56.167,02:16:57.376,Samantha!
02:16:57.417,02:16:59.252,Where's Mason Sr.?
02:16:59.294,02:17:01.338,I'm feeling generous.
02:17:03.090,02:17:05.258,Great.
02:17:03.090,02:17:07.178,And-- Beautiful.
02:17:07.219,02:17:09.013,I'll e-mail these to everyone.
02:17:09.055,02:17:12.099,Whoo!
02:17:21.984,02:17:24.695,Can't believe you guys came all this way.
02:17:24.737,02:17:28.490,Mmm. We wouldn't have missed it for anything.
02:17:28.532,02:17:30.826,I'm so proud of you.
02:17:30.868,02:17:33.120,Congratulations.
02:17:33.162,02:17:34.997,I'm really sorry that Lee couldn't be here.
02:17:35.039,02:17:36.790,He's on his senior trip.
02:17:36.832,02:17:38.918,Tell him I said hi.
02:17:38.959,02:17:41.087,"Abby, I didn't even recognize you."
02:17:41.128,02:17:43.714,- I'm 13.
02:17:43.756,02:17:46.842,Everybody just died laughing!
02:17:46.884,02:17:49.053,"All right, let's top her off."
02:17:50.096,02:17:51.638,"You want some, doll?"
02:17:51.680,02:17:53.306,"Um, sure."
02:17:53.348,02:17:55.642,Yeah. Absolutely.
02:17:57.019,02:17:59.897,What is it?
02:17:59.939,02:18:04.235,That is worth something.
02:18:04.276,02:18:06.361,God.
02:18:06.403,02:18:09.322,"Yeah, yeah."
02:18:09.364,02:18:12.868,It'll be-- Three-second rule.
02:18:12.910,02:18:15.328,Such a great dad.
02:18:15.370,02:18:17.497,"Come here, you guys."
02:18:17.539,02:18:20.292,- Whoo! Yeah!
02:18:20.333,02:18:24.588,"Now, Mason, I know you didn't really wanna have a party today, but... we did."
02:18:24.630,02:18:28.550,And you only graduate high school once in your life.
02:18:28.592,02:18:32.679,So I wanna celebrate you and this next phase.
02:18:32.721,02:18:34.556,And you're gonna learn so much in college.
02:18:34.598,02:18:37.350,You're gonna have so much fun.
02:18:37.392,02:18:40.687,You're gonna learn more about your art.
02:18:40.729,02:18:42.773,"I love you, babe."
02:18:42.815,02:18:45.067,To Mason.
02:18:45.109,02:18:46.777,Hear! Hear!
02:18:46.819,02:18:48.862,- To Mason.
02:18:50.405,02:18:52.365,"All right, you're up, kid."
02:18:52.407,02:18:59.999,"Oh, uh-- All right, uh-- Well, Mason, I'll make a toast to the future."
02:19:00.040,02:19:02.168,To your future.
02:19:02.209,02:19:07.380,"It's been a little sketchy, this end of the school year here, trying to figure out what school to go to."
02:19:07.422,02:19:10.425,"Mason told me that, uh, he wanted..."
02:19:10.467,02:19:12.552,to get as far away from home as possible...
02:19:12.594,02:19:14.305,but still honor our agreement...
02:19:14.346,02:19:17.349,"that we pay in-state tuition, which I do appreciate."
02:19:17.390,02:19:20.393,"He's a prudent man, and he's gonna have a great future."
02:19:20.435,02:19:21.770,"So here's to you, buddy."
02:19:21.812,02:19:23.396,Whoo!
02:19:23.438,02:19:25.232,Hear! Hear!
02:19:26.525,02:19:28.652,Mason Jr.
02:19:28.694,02:19:32.739,"High school graduate, 18 and straight."
02:19:32.781,02:19:36.118,Just ignore him.
02:19:36.160,02:19:38.411,"Well, I've not known you as long as everybody here."
02:19:38.453,02:19:43.416,"But, uh-- uh, since I have known you, uh, you've grown a lot."
02:19:43.458,02:19:46.128,"And, uh, I-I-- I don't know-- I'm proud of you."
02:19:46.170,02:19:50.423,"So if this photography thing doesn't work out, you know you always got a job."
02:19:50.465,02:19:52.092,Lose that earring.
02:19:52.134,02:19:54.887,"But, uh, you know, maybe I can get you in front of house."
02:19:54.928,02:19:57.014,All right.
02:19:59.141,02:20:01.894,"- Sam, say something."
02:20:01.935,02:20:04.437,"Um-- Come on, darlin'."
02:20:04.479,02:20:06.357,Good luck.
02:20:09.235,02:20:10.986,"Yeah, Mason!"
02:20:11.028,02:20:13.155,Congratulations.
02:20:13.197,02:20:15.448,Aw!
02:20:15.490,02:20:17.784,"So, you broke up with your girlfriend?"
02:20:17.826,02:20:19.786,Yeah.
02:20:19.828,02:20:21.872,What was her name?
02:20:21.914,02:20:23.456,Sheena.
02:20:23.498,02:20:25.918,She's gonna go to college with you?
02:20:25.959,02:20:27.336,No.
02:20:27.378,02:20:29.504,No.
02:20:29.546,02:20:32.341,"Oh, okay. You need a ride to college?"
02:20:32.383,02:20:34.760,Oh!
02:20:34.801,02:20:37.804,I just wanted to say hello before you got out of here.
02:20:37.846,02:20:39.765,"You guys met before, haven't you?"
02:20:39.806,02:20:42.475,"Yeah, yeah, we met at, uh, Sam's graduation."
02:20:42.517,02:20:44.477,And with your little one.
02:20:44.519,02:20:46.939,"Oh, he's at home."
02:20:46.980,02:20:50.776,"Remember, he was such a pain at Sam's thing that, you know-- Oh, I would love to see him."
02:20:50.817,02:20:55.197,"Well, we have a special weekend this weekend, so-- I'm so glad you found her."
02:20:55.239,02:20:57.490,"You-- You've got him at a good time, I think."
02:20:57.532,02:20:59.492,I think so too.
02:20:59.534,02:21:01.787,It's good to see you too.
02:21:01.828,02:21:05.165,I'm so proud of your boy.
02:21:08.294,02:21:15.092,"If you think she's a bitch now, you should have seen her-- you're going to college, though, all right?"
02:21:15.134,02:21:20.347,"And if you're anything like me or your old man, you're gonna be pulling down some serious wool."
02:21:20.389,02:21:22.515,You're gonna be tapping some masterful gap.
02:21:22.557,02:21:24.184,You're gonna be doing some good work out there.
02:21:24.226,02:21:26.519,Think about it.
02:21:26.561,02:21:28.188,But you got to do me a favor.
02:21:28.230,02:21:30.149,"You're gonna be vulnerable this summer, all right?"
02:21:30.190,02:21:33.360,Remember to use protection during breakup sex.
02:21:35.279,02:21:37.739,This guy knows exactly of which I speak.
02:21:37.781,02:21:41.785,Look what happened to him. Voilà.
02:21:43.495,02:21:44.997,Cheers.
02:21:45.038,02:21:47.540,It-- It's not that simple.
02:21:47.582,02:21:48.792,Four more years.
02:21:48.834,02:21:51.128,Four more years.
02:21:51.170,02:21:52.504,I'm just saying.
02:21:55.132,02:21:57.259,Do y'all recycle?
02:21:57.301,02:21:58.760,Should I-- I have one started there.
02:21:58.802,02:22:01.596,"Oh, yeah, right."
02:22:02.931,02:22:07.686,"Am I, uh-- Am I your only ex at this party?"
02:22:07.727,02:22:11.064,Yes. I'm not your only wife here though.
02:22:13.233,02:22:14.651,Yeah.
02:22:16.611,02:22:18.989,Can you believe they're both out of high school?
02:22:20.157,02:22:21.616,No.
02:22:21.658,02:22:23.327,"No, I can't."
02:22:25.037,02:22:29.333,"You did a great job with both of them, by the way."
02:22:29.375,02:22:31.584,Thanks for saying that.
02:22:31.626,02:22:33.504,I never thought I'd hear you say that.
02:22:33.545,02:22:36.382,"Well, it's true."
02:22:37.674,02:22:39.592,"You're doing it all over again, huh?"
02:22:39.634,02:22:41.887,"I know. I know, right?"
02:22:41.928,02:22:46.225,"It's gonna be, uh, 15 years till I have an empty nest."
02:22:46.266,02:22:48.060,Hmm.
02:22:48.101,02:22:50.937,"But hey, I'd love to pitch in, help with this, if I could."
02:22:50.979,02:22:52.898,It's so great that you did this.
02:22:52.939,02:22:57.736,Can I just give you a little-- I'd appreciate it if I could-- Sure. Yeah.
02:22:57.777,02:23:00.197,Yeah. But I don't have any cash.
02:23:00.239,02:23:02.866,"No, it's in Annie's purse."
02:23:10.665,02:23:13.626,So it sucks.
02:23:13.668,02:23:17.381,"I mean, what are you gonna do?"
02:23:17.423,02:23:20.008,You want a beer?
02:23:20.050,02:23:22.094,You can have one.
02:23:22.135,02:23:27.391,"Yeah, well, for what it's worth, we've all been through the exact same thing at one point or another."
02:23:28.683,02:23:30.310,It's not the same though.
02:23:30.352,02:23:32.687,"I mean, you never got to know her."
02:23:32.729,02:23:34.856,It's not the same.
02:23:34.898,02:23:37.150,I just don't know what I did wrong.
02:23:37.192,02:23:41.405,"Hey, Jimmy."
02:23:41.447,02:23:43.282,"Hey, Mason."
02:23:43.323,02:23:45.658,"We're up here, uh, raiding the green room."
02:23:45.700,02:23:48.036,That's totally cool.
02:23:51.039,02:23:53.459,Wow.
02:23:53.500,02:23:54.834,Uh-huh. Right?
02:23:54.876,02:23:56.711,Unbelievable.
02:23:56.753,02:24:00.466,"Well, we just decided to come a little early, check you out."
02:24:00.507,02:24:02.675,"That's cool, man."
02:24:02.717,02:24:05.554,All right. All right.
02:24:05.596,02:24:07.931,"These high school love things, they never work out."
02:24:07.973,02:24:09.682,"Here, come here."
02:24:09.724,02:24:12.685,"I mean, everybody's just changing so much, you know?"
02:24:12.727,02:24:18.817,"The odds of two young people staying on the same wavelength are-- Yeah, but still-- Look, and I also guarantee you..."
02:24:18.858,02:24:22.695,that every day of your life that you spend crying over some silly girl...
02:24:22.737,02:24:25.616,is a complete waste of time.
02:24:25.657,02:24:27.033,She wasn't a silly girl though.
02:24:27.075,02:24:29.536,"I mean, she's a serious person."
02:24:29.578,02:24:33.706,I really thought we were-- What?
02:24:33.748,02:24:35.834,Here's the truth.
02:24:35.875,02:24:38.545,Women are never satisfied. Okay?
02:24:38.587,02:24:44.593,"They're always looking to potentially trade up, and that's, I'm sorry to say, what I think has happened to you, my fine-feathered friend."
02:24:44.635,02:24:45.927,What does that even mean?
02:24:45.969,02:24:49.722,It means don't hand over the controls to your self-esteem to Sheila.
02:24:49.764,02:24:52.892,Sheena.
02:24:49.764,02:24:55.354,"All right, it means you are responsible for you, not your girlfriend, not your mom, not me."
02:24:55.395,02:25:01.193,"You. And if you truly take care of you, you will be amazed at how much girls like Sheena..."
02:25:01.234,02:25:03.695,start lining up at your front door.
02:25:03.736,02:25:05.447,Great.
02:25:05.489,02:25:08.741,"Yeah, you know, you just gotta separate yourself from the pack in some way."
02:25:08.783,02:25:12.579,"Excel at something, you know, and then you have your pick of the litter..."
02:25:12.621,02:25:14.998,when them front-running hussies start sniffing around.
02:25:15.040,02:25:17.668,So what you're saying is I should take up lacrosse.
02:25:17.709,02:25:21.672,"Exactly. Or you could, you know, start a band."
02:25:21.713,02:25:23.756,Worked for me a long time ago.
02:25:23.798,02:25:25.592,I think it's still working for Jimmy.
02:25:25.634,02:25:28.220,Or you just keep taking pictures.
02:25:28.261,02:25:31.139,She hated the pictures I took of her.
02:25:31.181,02:25:32.765,"All right. I'm sick to death of her, okay?"
02:25:32.807,02:25:35.561,I only met her a few times.
02:25:35.602,02:25:41.233,"But truth be told, I always thought she was a little bit-- you know, a little bit too square for you."
02:25:41.274,02:25:43.610,"You know, not quite the same vibe."
02:25:43.652,02:25:46.821,You really thought that?
02:25:46.863,02:25:51.243,"I mean, uh, I wasn't surprised when it turned out..."
02:25:51.284,02:25:54.871,"she was interested in some knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?"
02:25:54.913,02:25:56.831,"I mean, the bottom line is..."
02:25:56.873,02:25:58.709,it's all timing with these things.
02:25:58.750,02:26:00.168,Yeah.
02:26:00.210,02:26:02.588,"I mean, uh, take your mom and me."
02:26:02.629,02:26:06.592,I think I've probably turned into the boring castrated guy...
02:26:06.633,02:26:09.553,"she wanted me to be 15, 20 years ago, you know?"
02:26:09.595,02:26:11.804,I'm not saying she was wrong to be pissed. I'm not.
02:26:11.846,02:26:18.270,"I'm just saying that she could've been a little more patient, a little more forgiving."
02:26:27.153,02:26:28.821,So what's the point?
02:26:29.906,02:26:31.575,Of what?
02:26:32.618,02:26:35.078,I don't know.
02:26:35.995,02:26:37.830,Everything?
02:26:37.872,02:26:41.293,What's the point?
02:26:41.334,02:26:43.836,"Neither does anybody else, okay?"
02:26:43.878,02:26:46.839,We're all just...
02:26:46.881,02:26:48.841,The good news is you're feeling stuff.
02:26:48.883,02:26:51.844,You know? And you got to hold on to that.
02:26:51.886,02:26:55.140,"You do. I mean, you get older and you don't feel as much."
02:26:55.181,02:26:56.975,Your skin gets tougher.
02:26:57.016,02:27:02.648,"The point is those pictures you took-- thousands of submissions from all over the state, and you won."
02:27:02.689,02:27:04.857,"Well, I got silver."
02:27:04.899,02:27:07.277,And nine other people did too.
02:27:07.319,02:27:10.905,"I'm trying to tell you that I believe in you, Mason."
02:27:10.947,02:27:13.575,"And if some girl doesn't see that, then fuck her, you know?"
02:27:15.410,02:27:18.288,"Hey, this next one goes out to a young man in the house."
02:27:18.330,02:27:21.874,Whoo-hoo!
02:27:21.916,02:27:26.421,Now he's all graduated from high school and making me feel old.
02:27:28.298,02:27:30.425,"Happy high school graduation, Mason."
02:27:57.786,02:27:59.788,Thank you.
02:27:59.830,02:28:01.914,"Okay, guys, let's be clear."
02:28:01.956,02:28:03.750,I'm gonna break this into four categories.
02:28:03.792,02:28:06.919,One-- anything you wanna keep from your childhood and you're taking with you.
02:28:06.961,02:28:09.214,Two-- throwing away.
02:28:09.255,02:28:11.550,Three-- donating.
02:28:11.591,02:28:15.387,Four-- whatever you wanna try to sell at the garage sale next weekend.
02:28:15.428,02:28:17.889,"Whatever we don't sell, we're donating."
02:28:17.930,02:28:22.185,"Doesn't the apartment have, like, an attic or storage or something?"
02:28:22.227,02:28:24.979,No. You're missing the point.
02:28:25.021,02:28:28.107,We're not gonna drag a bunch of crap to Mom's tiny apartment.
02:28:28.149,02:28:31.069,Can't believe we're moving again.
02:28:31.110,02:28:33.363,"No, I'm moving."
02:28:33.405,02:28:34.947,You have an apartment in Austin.
02:28:34.989,02:28:37.409,Mason is moving in the fall.
02:28:37.450,02:28:39.369,I'm done.
02:28:39.411,02:28:41.705,This will be great for me.
02:28:41.747,02:28:43.248,I can take a sabbatical.
02:28:43.289,02:28:45.667,"I can get some writing done, try to get published."
02:28:45.709,02:28:47.960,What about Christmas though?
02:28:48.002,02:28:49.671,I'm not sharing a room with him.
02:28:49.713,02:28:53.675,"One of you will sleep on the couch, and we'll use that blow-up mattress."
02:28:53.717,02:28:56.344,How am I supposed to do my laundry?
02:28:56.386,02:29:00.056,"Sam, I'm gently pushing you out of the nest."
02:29:00.098,02:29:04.853,"And on your way down, you may magically find some quarters..."
02:29:04.895,02:29:07.980,that you use to do laundry in your own apartment.
02:29:08.022,02:29:11.359,"Come on, you guys are adults."
02:29:11.401,02:29:13.945,You need to take some responsibility.
02:29:13.986,02:29:15.363,"Now, what do you want?"
02:29:16.989,02:29:18.991,I'm gonna get the veggie burger.
02:29:19.033,02:29:21.202,I'm not having anything.
02:29:21.244,02:29:23.996,What's wrong with you?
02:29:24.038,02:29:25.874,I'm sick.
02:29:25.916,02:29:29.001,"What is it, your head?"
02:29:29.043,02:29:31.379,She's pregnant.
02:29:31.421,02:29:36.008,"No. To be honest, I drank way too much last night."
02:29:36.050,02:29:37.761,"You weren't driving, were you?"
02:29:37.803,02:29:41.389,"Carrie's back home, too, and we just hung out."
02:29:41.431,02:29:45.101,"You know, peach Smirnoffs, they just go down so easy."
02:29:45.143,02:29:48.062,"No, no."
02:29:48.104,02:29:49.898,You could still pack boxes.
02:29:49.940,02:29:52.734,These people wanna move in as soon as possible.
02:29:52.776,02:29:56.028,"Hi, guys."
02:29:56.070,02:30:00.032,"Uh, you probably don't remember me, but I worked on your septic line years ago."
02:30:00.074,02:30:01.576,"Oh, yeah."
02:30:01.618,02:30:04.579,"Believe it or not, you changed my life."
02:30:04.621,02:30:08.834,You told me that day that I was smart and that I should go to school.
02:30:08.875,02:30:10.209,I took your advice.
02:30:10.251,02:30:15.298,"I signed up for English classes, and then a year later I went to community college, and I got my associate's degree."
02:30:15.340,02:30:17.425,I'm working on my bachelor's now at Texas State...
02:30:17.467,02:30:19.051,and also one of the managers here.
02:30:19.093,02:30:20.345,That's great.
02:30:20.386,02:30:22.221,"Uh, it's good to see you."
02:30:22.263,02:30:26.601,Because I really wanted a chance to-to thank you for that.
02:30:26.643,02:30:28.353,It really meant a lot to me.
02:30:28.394,02:30:30.605,Don't worry about lunch.
02:30:30.647,02:30:33.232,It's on me.
02:30:33.274,02:30:36.736,You guys should listen to her.
02:30:36.778,02:30:38.822,Thank you.
02:30:53.127,02:30:58.341,"Isn't that kind of crazy, though, that a computer knows who you are from just 20 questions off a form?"
02:30:58.383,02:31:01.636,"I guess there are really only, like, eight types of people in the world."
02:31:01.678,02:31:07.851,"I mean, there are subsets, like male and female, but apparently we're not as unique as we wanna think we are."
02:31:07.893,02:31:10.269,Have you even talked to this guy yet?
02:31:10.311,02:31:12.104,"No, but we've been trading e-mails."
02:31:12.146,02:31:13.732,He seems pretty cool.
02:31:13.773,02:31:16.818,He's studying literature and anthropology.
02:31:16.860,02:31:20.112,"And he's way into Bright Eyes, so that's not so bad."
02:31:20.154,02:31:21.531,"But anyways, he was telling me..."
02:31:21.573,02:31:24.116,about how the system they use for assigning roommates...
02:31:24.158,02:31:25.744,is kind of spooky.
02:31:25.785,02:31:28.246,"Like, the freshman satisfaction rate for new roommates..."
02:31:28.287,02:31:30.122,"used to be, like, 60%."
02:31:30.164,02:31:33.418,And now it's a hundred...
02:31:33.459,02:31:38.172,"Well, sounds like he'll be a good roommate then."
02:31:38.214,02:31:42.134,But we've pretty much decided that soon they won't even need a questionnaire...
02:31:42.176,02:31:47.807,"'cause they'll just let the N.S.A. scan your digital ghost, and they'll tell you who your roommate is..."
02:31:47.849,02:31:51.519,"based on everything you've ever said, written or clicked."
02:31:51.561,02:31:54.981,Did you-- Did you put this in here again?
02:31:55.023,02:31:56.524,I don't want it.
02:31:56.566,02:31:59.778,"Come on, it's the first picture you ever took."
02:31:59.819,02:32:03.573,"Well, I mean, all the more reason to leave it behind, right?"
02:32:19.756,02:32:21.800,What?
02:32:21.841,02:32:23.175,"No, what is it?"
02:32:23.217,02:32:24.803,Nothing.
02:32:25.637,02:32:27.097,Mom.
02:32:29.891,02:32:32.936,This is the worst day of my life.
02:32:32.978,02:32:35.981,What are you talking about?
02:32:36.022,02:32:38.900,I didn't know you were gonna be so fucking happy to be leaving.
02:32:39.985,02:32:41.778,"I mean, it's not that I'm that happy."
02:32:41.820,02:32:43.780,What do you-- What do you expect?
02:32:43.822,02:32:47.325,You know what I'm realizing?
02:32:47.366,02:32:49.661,This series of milestones.
02:32:49.702,02:32:53.081,"Getting married, having kids, getting divorced."
02:32:53.123,02:32:55.583,The time that we thought you were dyslexic.
02:32:55.625,02:32:58.210,When I taught you how to ride a bike.
02:32:58.252,02:33:00.212,Getting divorced again.
02:33:00.254,02:33:01.631,Getting my master's degree.
02:33:01.673,02:33:03.675,Finally getting the job I wanted.
02:33:03.716,02:33:07.219,Sending Samantha off to college.
02:33:07.261,02:33:09.263,You know what's next? Huh?
02:33:09.305,02:33:11.516,It's my fucking funeral.
02:33:13.434,02:33:15.687,"Just go, and leave my picture!"
02:33:17.939,02:33:21.484,"Aren't you jumping ahead by, like, 40 years or something?"
02:33:24.278,02:33:27.657,I just thought there would be more.
02:35:43.417,02:35:44.752,"Hey, you must be Mason."
02:35:44.794,02:35:46.378,Yeah.
02:35:46.420,02:35:48.798,"Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet you."
02:35:48.840,02:35:51.801,"Uh, you cool with this side of the room?"
02:35:51.843,02:35:54.012,Got in this morning.
02:35:54.053,02:35:57.431,"Well, yeah. I don't-- I don't care. No worries."
02:35:57.473,02:35:59.684,Can I help you with anything?
02:35:59.725,02:36:02.394,"I just got, like, one box left."
02:36:02.436,02:36:05.648,But I appreciate it.
02:36:07.650,02:36:11.279,"Um, are you going to the orientation mixer thing?"
02:36:12.446,02:36:15.700,Orientation mixer thing?
02:36:15.741,02:36:17.952,"I'm not going to that, and neither are you, by the way."
02:36:17.994,02:36:20.412,We got way better stuff to be doing.
02:36:20.454,02:36:22.081,You ready?
02:36:22.123,02:36:24.292,"Hey, Barb, this is my roommate, Mason."
02:36:24.334,02:36:25.335,Hi.
02:36:25.376,02:36:28.420,- You comin' with us?
02:36:28.462,02:36:30.422,Hiking.
02:36:30.464,02:36:32.591,"If we leave now, we can catch the late afternoon at Big Bend."
02:36:32.633,02:36:36.221,"- You ever been before, man?"
02:36:36.262,02:36:38.348,"Oh, well, then all the more reason to come now, man."
02:36:38.389,02:36:39.974,"That's why we're here, dude."
02:36:41.142,02:36:43.435,"Oh, Mason."
02:36:43.477,02:36:45.146,"Hey, what's up?"
02:36:45.188,02:36:46.438,Hi.
02:36:46.480,02:36:48.233,"Mason, Nicole."
02:36:48.274,02:36:51.443,"- So, you game?"
02:36:51.485,02:36:53.696,Here.
02:36:53.738,02:36:55.489,Got it timed perfectly.
02:36:55.531,02:36:57.075,It'll kick in when we get to the mountains.
02:36:57.116,02:36:58.910,Awesome.
02:37:06.376,02:37:08.378,Do they let you major in that here?
02:37:08.419,02:37:15.301,"Well, it's not that serious here, so I kind of, like, train outside of the university, but I'm taking all my basics like History of Dance and all that."
02:37:15.343,02:37:16.594,Nice.
02:37:17.678,02:37:19.805,What do you teach?
02:37:19.847,02:37:24.476,"Uh, ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop."
02:37:24.518,02:37:26.271,Which one's your favorite?
02:37:26.312,02:37:27.772,Tap.
02:37:27.813,02:37:32.484,"Yeah. You get to, like, make up all your own sounds, and there's no rules."
02:37:32.526,02:37:34.486,"And just, like, creative freedom."
02:37:34.528,02:37:36.030,That's great.
02:37:36.072,02:37:37.656,That's why I love teaching it...
02:37:37.698,02:37:39.284,'cause it's so beautiful to me...
02:37:39.325,02:37:45.497,"and it's kind of dying away in this generation, so to be a part of, like, bringing it back to the kids-- Right."
02:37:45.539,02:37:47.166,Yeah.
02:37:47.208,02:37:48.667,Six to eight.
02:37:48.709,02:37:52.380,"Yeah. They have, like, no fear, and they're not self-conscious at all."
02:37:52.422,02:37:54.506,They haven't reached the awkward years yet.
02:37:54.548,02:37:56.592,"Yeah, not yet."
02:38:12.566,02:38:14.485,Hey.
02:38:25.830,02:38:28.582,Dalton can be crazy sometimes.
02:38:28.624,02:38:31.502,He seems cool though.
02:38:31.543,02:38:33.338,"Yeah, they're both really cool."
02:38:36.548,02:38:38.050,How are you feeling?
02:38:40.386,02:38:41.929,Great.
02:38:41.971,02:38:45.099,"Really great, to be honest."
02:38:45.141,02:38:46.558,Good.
02:38:49.187,02:38:51.939,I'm really happy that you're hangin' out with us.
02:38:51.981,02:38:53.524,Yeah.
02:38:53.565,02:38:55.567,Me too.
02:38:55.609,02:38:59.155,This moment's having a multiple orgasm.
02:38:59.197,02:39:02.325,It-It's as if all of time has unfolded before us...
02:39:02.367,02:39:06.329,"so we could stand here and look out and scream, Fuck yeah!"
02:39:06.371,02:39:08.164,Whoo!
02:39:12.293,02:39:16.839,"You know how everyone's always saying, Seize the moment?"
02:39:18.632,02:39:23.221,I don't know.
02:39:23.262,02:39:26.516,"You know, like, the moment seizes us."
02:39:26.557,02:39:28.351,Yeah.
02:39:28.393,02:39:29.768,"Yeah, I know."
02:39:28.393,02:39:32.604,"It's-- It's constant, the moments."
02:39:32.646,02:39:37.609,"It's just-- It's like it's always right now, you know?"
02:39:40.405,02:39:41.822,Yeah.
