00:00:28.320,00:00:30.364,- JESUS. - DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK?
00:00:30.447,00:00:32.366,BLUE TOYOTA CAMRY. THAT'S ALL I SAW.
00:00:32.449,00:00:33.617,THAT'S THE WHARTONS' DOG.
00:00:35.494,00:00:37.830,HE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. GO SEE IF THEY'RE HOME.
00:00:49.967,00:00:52.011,IT'S OKAY.
00:00:54.680,00:01:04.231,"THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PAIN: THE SORT OF PAIN THAT MAKES YOU STRONG, OR USELESS PAIN, THE SORT OF PAIN THAT'S ONLY SUFFERING."
00:01:04.314,00:01:07.526,I HAVE NO PATIENCE FOR USELESS THINGS.
00:01:09.277,00:01:17.619,"MOMENTS LIKE THIS REQUIRE SOMEONE WHO WILL ACT, WHO WILL DO THE UNPLEASANT THING, THE NECESSARY THING."
00:01:22.457,00:01:23.792,THERE.
00:01:23.876,00:01:25.419,NO MORE PAIN.
00:01:27.755,00:01:30.507,IT WAS A HIT-AND-RUN. I'M AWFULLY SORRY.
00:01:30.591,00:01:32.634,HE MUST HAVE JUMPED OVER THE FENCE AGAIN.
00:01:32.718,00:01:36.263,"LOOK, STEVE IS GOING TO FILE THE REPORT ON THE CAR, AND HE'LL PUT HIS PEOPLE ON IT."
00:01:36.346,00:01:38.139,WE'LL TRACK THEM DOWN.
00:01:58.077,00:02:00.996,YOU LOOK STUNNING. SHALL WE?
00:02:03.415,00:02:05.876,HAPPY NEW YEAR!
00:02:12.215,00:02:14.635,OH. PRESIDENT-ELECT GARRETT WALKER.
00:02:14.718,00:02:16.261,DO I LIKE HIM? NO.
00:02:16.344,00:02:18.097,DO I BELIEVE IN HIM? THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT.
00:02:18.179,00:02:24.728,"ANY POLITICIAN THAT GETS 70 MILLION VOTES HAS TAPPED INTO SOMETHING LARGER THAN HIMSELF, LARGER THAN EVEN ME, AS MUCH AS I HATE TO ADMIT IT."
00:02:24.812,00:02:27.731,"AND LOOK AT THAT WINNING SMILE, THOSE TRUSTING EYES."
00:02:27.815,00:02:30.651,I LATCHED ONTO HIM EARLY ON AND MADE MYSELF VITAL.
00:02:30.734,00:02:35.030,"AFTER 22 YEARS IN CONGRESS, I CAN SMELL WHICH WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING."
00:02:35.114,00:02:38.241,"OH, JIM MATTHEWS, HIS RIGHT HONORABLE VICE-PRESIDENT."
00:02:38.325,00:02:40.077,FORMER GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA.
00:02:40.160,00:02:45.833,"HE DID HIS DUTY IN DELIVERING THE KEYSTONE STATE, BLESS HIS HEART, AND NOW THEY'RE ABOUT TO PUT HIM OUT TO PASTURE."
00:02:45.916,00:02:47.876,"BUT HE LOOKS HAPPY ENOUGH, DOESN'T HE?"
00:02:47.960,00:02:51.880,"FOR SOME, IT'S SIMPLY THE SIZE OF THE CHAIR."
00:02:51.964,00:02:53.715,HUH.
00:02:53.799,00:02:55.926,"LINDA VASQUEZ, WALKER'S CHIEF OF STAFF."
00:02:56.010,00:02:57.511,I GOT HER HIRED.
00:02:57.594,00:03:03.224,"SHE'S A WOMAN, CHECK, AND A LATINA, CHECK, BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT, SHE'S AS TOUGH AS A TWO-DOLLAR STEAK."
00:03:03.308,00:03:04.852,"CHECK, CHECK, CHECK."
00:03:04.935,00:03:10.231,"WHEN IT COMES TO THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU NOT ONLY NEED THE KEYS IN YOUR BACK POCKET, YOU NEED THE GATEKEEPER."
00:03:10.315,00:03:12.860,"AS FOR ME, I'M JUST A LOWLY HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP."
00:03:12.943,00:03:16.905,I KEEP THINGS MOVING IN A CONGRESS CHOKED BY PETTINESS AND LASSITUDE.
00:03:16.989,00:03:20.117,MY JOB IS TO CLEAR THE PIPES AND KEEP THE SLUDGE MOVING.
00:03:20.199,00:03:22.036,BUT I WON'T HAVE TO BE A PLUMBER MUCH LONGER.
00:03:22.119,00:03:24.287,I'VE DONE MY TIME. I BACKED THE RIGHT MAN.
00:03:27.457,00:03:29.168,GIVE AND TAKE.
00:03:29.250,00:03:31.086,WELCOME TO WASHINGTON.
00:05:09.601,00:05:11.519,YOU NEED A HAIRCUT.
00:05:11.603,00:05:12.938,YOU THINK?
00:05:13.021,00:05:14.731,A LITTLE TRIM.
00:05:16.316,00:05:17.859,WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO WEAR?
00:05:17.943,00:05:20.112,- YOU MEAN FOR THE MEETING? - FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT.
00:05:20.195,00:05:23.073,"GONNA WEAR MY NAVY BLUE, THE ONE WITH THE PINSTRIPES."
00:05:23.157,00:05:26.034,GOOD. YOU LOOK HANDSOME IN THAT SUIT.
00:05:27.702,00:05:30.622,I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL ANNOUNCE IT BEFORE YOUR BOARD MEETING.
00:05:30.705,00:05:32.291,"WELL, AS LONG AS I CAN SAY THE DONATION IS COMING."
00:05:32.373,00:05:35.961,"AS SOON AS IT'S OFFICIAL, SANCORP WILL WRITE YOU A CHECK."
00:05:39.131,00:05:41.967,THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG YEAR FOR US.
00:05:56.355,00:05:58.150,"YOU KNOW, THE MEETING'S ON TUESDAY."
00:06:03.989,00:06:05.532,COMMUNITY OF WHAT?
00:06:05.615,00:06:10.078,"OR I COULD SAY IMMIGRATION, BANKING, OR EDUCATION, BUT NONE OF MY REGULAR SOURCES CAN CONFIRM THAT."
00:06:10.162,00:06:13.581,"BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW, OR BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TALKING?"
00:06:13.665,00:06:15.125,BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW.
00:06:15.209,00:06:17.376,KEEP AT IT. GET ME SOMETHING.
00:06:17.460,00:06:20.297,"SORRY. SORRY, MR. HAMMERSCHMIDT."
00:06:20.379,00:06:22.632,ZOE.
00:06:22.716,00:06:24.759,- BARNES. - RIGHT.
00:06:28.055,00:06:30.182,DID IT TAKE HIM A YEAR TO REMEMBER YOUR NAME?
00:06:30.265,00:06:31.266,LONGER.
00:06:31.350,00:06:33.434,"GOOD MORNING, LUCAS."
00:06:33.518,00:06:35.729,"WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, ZOE?"
00:06:37.605,00:06:39.691,I AM SICK OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY COUNCIL.
00:06:39.774,00:06:41.318,YOU TELL ME EVERY DAY.
00:06:41.400,00:06:45.697,"MOVE ME ONLINE. MY OWN BLOG-- FIRST PERSON, SUBJECTIVE, 500 WORDS."
00:06:45.780,00:06:47.782,- NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. - I'LL GO UNDERGROUND.
00:06:47.866,00:06:49.408,BACK ROOMS. THE URINALS.
00:06:49.492,00:06:51.203,I'LL WIN OVER STAFF MEMBERS ON THE HILL.
00:06:51.286,00:06:53.288,- THEY NEED A PLACE TO VENT. - A GOSSIP COLUMN.
00:06:53.372,00:06:55.874,"NO. WE LIFT THE VEIL, WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON."
00:06:55.957,00:06:57.709,"THIS IS THE WASHINGTON HERALD, ZOE."
00:06:57.792,00:06:59.544,IT'S NOT TMZ.
00:06:59.627,00:07:00.795,DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WATCH TMZ?
00:07:00.879,00:07:02.214,I COULDN'T CARE LESS.
00:07:02.297,00:07:04.007,WHICH IS WHY PRINT JOURNALISM IS DYING.
00:07:04.091,00:07:06.260,"THEN IT'LL DIE WITH DIGNITY, AT LEAST AT THIS PAPER."
00:07:06.343,00:07:09.096,"YOU ARE STUCK IN THE 20TH CENTURY, LUCAS. YOU LACK IMAGINATION."
00:07:09.179,00:07:12.432,"MAYBE SO, BUT RIGHT NOW, I DON'T NEED IMAGINATION. I NEED COPY."
00:07:12.515,00:07:14.309,YOUR NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS ARE YOURS.
00:07:14.393,00:07:17.729,"I APPLAUD WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO, AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ON MY TIME."
00:07:17.812,00:07:19.731,-YOU'RE TELLING ME TO GET BACK TO WORK. -I AM.
00:07:19.814,00:07:22.609,WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TELLING ME IS TO FUCK OFF.
00:07:22.692,00:07:24.027,I'M TELLING YOU BOTH.
00:07:27.364,00:07:31.618,IT'S MR. CHAPMAN ALREADY FROM PROVINCE TRUST.
00:07:36.998,00:07:38.792,"HOLD MY CALLS, CHRISTINA."
00:07:40.877,00:07:44.214,HENRY. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
00:07:44.298,00:07:46.341,- HOW LONG ARE YOU IN TOWN FOR? - JUST TODAY.
00:07:46.425,00:07:48.468,"WELL, YOU GOTTA COME BACK DOWN FOR THE INAUGURATION."
00:07:48.551,00:07:50.637,I CAN HOOK YOU UP.
00:07:50.720,00:07:52.806,HOW ABOUT YOU HOOK ME UP WITH THE ZONING LAWS YOU PROMISED TO GET CHANGED?
00:07:52.889,00:07:56.643,WE GOT 12 MILLION SITTING IN ESCROW FOR AN EMPTY LOT WE CAN'T BUILD ON.
00:07:56.726,00:07:59.687,"I KNOW, BUT YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND, IT'S A LOCAL MUNICIPAL ISSUE."
00:07:59.771,00:08:06.236,I CAN'T JUST PICK UP THE PHONE-- YOU CAN'T? BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU LED US TO BELIEVE WHEN YOU BEGGED FOR 50 GRAND IN DONATIONS.
00:08:09.072,00:08:10.240,ONE SECOND.
00:08:10.324,00:08:13.660,"CHRISTINA, I SAID NO CALLS, NOT WHILE I'M MEETING WITH MR. CHAPMAN."
00:08:15.662,00:08:17.705,THE PRESIDENT-ELECT?
00:08:19.249,00:08:20.875,I-- DO YOU MIND?
00:08:20.959,00:08:22.169,"NO. GO AHEAD, PLEASE."
00:08:22.252,00:08:23.920,"UH, PUT HIM THROUGH, CHRISTINA."
00:08:24.004,00:08:25.255,AHEM.
00:08:27.924,00:08:29.592,MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT?
00:08:32.846,00:08:37.434,"THANK YOU. UH, YES, WE WERE, UH-- WE WERE PLEASED TO WIN BY DOUBLE DIGITS."
00:08:38.810,00:08:40.479,ABSOLUTELY. ANYTHING YOU NEED.
00:08:40.561,00:08:51.739,"I NEED YOU TO PUT YOUR LONG, WET, TALENTED TONGUE BETWEEN MY THIGHS AND MAKE ME SQUEAL LIKE MONICA LEWIN-- ME, TOO. ME, TOO."
00:08:52.949,00:08:54.617,"OKAY. THANK YOU, SIR."
00:08:56.161,00:08:58.746,"I'M SO SORRY. UH, WHERE WERE WE?"
00:09:00.290,00:09:02.459,WALKER...
00:09:02.542,00:09:03.918,WHAT'S HE LIKE?
00:09:17.391,00:09:19.309,MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT RUNNING LATE?
00:09:19.393,00:09:21.811,"NO, HE COULDN'T MAKE IT. I'LL BRIEF HIM, THOUGH."
00:09:23.397,00:09:27.859,OKAY. THIS IS THE MEMO I'VE DRAFTED ON OUR MIDDLE EAST POLICY WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING.
00:09:27.942,00:09:29.819,"NOW, I WANT TO BORROW FROM REAGAN."
00:09:29.903,00:09:32.613,I'D LIKE TO COIN THE PHRASE TRICKLE-DOWN DIPLOMACY.
00:09:32.697,00:09:35.492,"- THAT WAY-- - FRANK, I'M GOING TO STOP YOU THERE."
00:09:35.575,00:09:38.328,WE ARE NOT NOMINATING YOU FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.
00:09:38.412,00:09:41.998,"I KNOW HE MADE YOU A PROMISE, BUT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED."
00:09:42.082,00:09:46.920,"THE NATURE OF PROMISES, LINDA, IS THAT THEY REMAIN IMMUNE TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES."
00:09:47.003,00:09:52.092,"GARRETT HAS THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT THIS, AND HE'S DECIDED WE NEED YOU TO STAY IN CONGRESS."
00:09:52.175,00:09:57.264,"WHEN WAS THIS DECISION MADE, AND WHY WASN'T I PART OF A CONVERSATION?"
00:09:57.347,00:10:00.392,"I'M SORRY, FRANK. IF IT HAD BEEN UP TO ME, I WOULDN'T HAVE WAITED THIS LONG TO TELL YOU."
00:10:00.475,00:10:02.685,"SO, YOU KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO DO THIS."
00:10:02.769,00:10:04.563,IT HAS BEEN AN EVOLVING DISCUSSION.
00:10:04.645,00:10:07.648,IT'S A CHICKEN-SHIT MOVE.
00:10:07.732,00:10:09.067,- FRANK-- - I WAS VETTED.
00:10:09.150,00:10:10.444,- WAS THAT A RUSE? - NO.
00:10:10.527,00:10:11.819,LET'S BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR.
00:10:11.903,00:10:13.780,YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WON WITHOUT ME.
00:10:13.863,00:10:18.076,"YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT NOW WE HAVE TO LEAD, AND THAT MEANS MAKING TOUGH CHOICES."
00:10:18.159,00:10:22.705,"AS YOU KNOW, EDUCATION IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR US, A COMPLETE FEDERAL OVERHAUL."
00:10:22.789,00:10:25.125,"BUT IT'S NOT JUST EDUCATION. FRANK, CONGRESS IS SPLIT."
00:10:25.208,00:10:29.337,WE NEED YOU THERE MORE THAN WE NEED YOU IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
00:10:29.421,00:10:31.423,"I GOT YOU HIRED, LINDA."
00:10:33.091,00:10:34.175,I KNOW.
00:10:34.259,00:10:35.635,"DONATIONS, ENDORSEMENTS."
00:10:35.718,00:10:39.222,I WROTE THE CAMPAIGN'S ENTIRE FOREIGN POLICY PLATFORM.
00:10:39.306,00:10:43.810,"I BRING YEARS OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE-- FRANK, PLEASE."
00:10:46.646,00:10:48.856,I WANT TO SPEAK TO WALKER PERSONALLY.
00:10:48.940,00:10:50.900,THE DECISION IS MADE.
00:10:54.946,00:10:57.491,"WE NEED YOU, FRANK."
00:10:57.574,00:10:59.700,WILL YOU STAND BESIDE US OR NOT?
00:11:09.503,00:11:11.671,OF COURSE. IF THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS.
00:11:11.754,00:11:14.799,I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
00:11:16.343,00:11:18.386,I'M CURIOUS.
00:11:18.470,00:11:20.054,"IF NOT ME, THEN WHO?"
00:11:22.182,00:11:23.724,MICHAEL KERN.
00:11:23.808,00:11:25.268,MICHAEL KERN?
00:11:26.853,00:11:28.605,WELL...
00:11:28.687,00:11:30.982,THAT IS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE.
00:11:34.944,00:11:36.446,CAN YOU MAKE IT MORE CLEAR?
00:11:36.530,00:11:42.827,"I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE'RE NEGLECTING OUR DOMESTIC-- NO. NO, NO, NO. I'M GOING TO SAY THAT WE'RE EXPANDING OUR MISSION."
00:11:42.910,00:11:44.329,OKAY.
00:11:44.412,00:11:47.040,AND WE'RE BRINGING ON A NEW ORGANIZATION TO HELP US.
00:11:47.123,00:11:48.707,DO YOU KNOW WHICH ONE YET?
00:11:48.791,00:11:55.006,"I'M STILL LOOKING INTO A FEW OPTIONS, BUT, UM, TELL ME, WHAT DID WE AGREE ON, THAT WE COULD HIRE HOW MANY NEW PEOPLE? SIX?"
00:11:55.089,00:11:56.466,"- SIX, MAYBE SEVEN. - HMM?"
00:11:56.550,00:11:58.259,WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH.
00:11:58.343,00:12:00.053,"OOH, IT'S EXCITING, HUH?"
00:12:00.136,00:12:03.264,"THIS, UH, NEW DIRECTION WE'RE HEADING."
00:12:03.348,00:12:06.100,I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING TO FIT ALL THE PEOPLE.
00:12:06.184,00:12:08.102,"WELL, DO YOU THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO ADDITIONAL SPACE?"
00:12:08.186,00:12:09.896,"NO. NO, NO, NO. I'LL FIND A WAY."
00:12:09.979,00:12:13.191,"OKAY, SO MAKE THE CHANGES TO THE POWERPOINT, AND LET'S MEET AGAIN AT 2:30."
00:12:13.274,00:12:14.359,OKAY.
00:12:25.744,00:12:27.247,IT'S ME.
00:12:27.330,00:12:29.207,I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT LEAVING MESSAGES LIKE THIS.
00:12:29.290,00:12:30.667,CALL ME BACK.
00:12:42.761,00:12:43.846,"WHAT IS IT, ZOE?"
00:12:43.930,00:12:46.015,UM...
00:12:46.099,00:12:54.232,"I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL AT THE WHITE HOUSE, SO IF YOU NEED SOMEONE TO DO RESEARCH OR-- OR PRINT OUT BACKGROUND-- I THINK I'LL BE FINE."
00:12:54.315,00:13:00.821,"WELL, IF THINGS GET HECTIC AND YOU NEED ANY HELP-- SO YOU CAN BLOG ABOUT RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH THE BIG BOYS?"
00:13:03.991,00:13:05.535,WHAT DID LUCAS TELL YOU?
00:13:05.619,00:13:09.623,"LOOK, NO OFFENSE, ZOE, BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE ANYONE'S TRAINING WHEELS."
00:13:09.706,00:13:12.041,I JUST THOUGHT...
00:13:12.125,00:13:14.753,"NO, I WAS ACTUALLY OFFERING TO LEND A HAND."
00:13:14.835,00:13:16.337,- THAT'S IT. - GOT IT.
00:13:16.421,00:13:17.922,THANKS.
00:13:58.296,00:14:00.089,- CLAIRE. - YOU DIDN'T CALL.
00:14:00.173,00:14:03.468,"- I WAS-- - YOU DIDN'T CALL ME, FRANCIS."
00:14:03.551,00:14:07.514,"NINE HOURS. YOU DON'T NOT CALL ME, NOT WHEN IT'S THIS BIG."
00:14:07.597,00:14:08.889,YOU'RE RIGHT.
00:14:08.973,00:14:11.685,WHEN HAVE WE EVER AVOIDED EACH OTHER?
00:14:13.894,00:14:15.772,I WANTED THE SOLUTION FIRST.
00:14:15.854,00:14:17.148,DO YOU HAVE ONE?
00:14:17.231,00:14:19.150,NOT YET.
00:14:19.233,00:14:21.277,"THIS AFFECTS ME, TOO, FRANCIS."
00:14:21.361,00:14:24.113,AND IT'S NOT THE MONEY I'M UPSET ABOUT.
00:14:24.197,00:14:26.949,IT'S THAT WE DO THINGS TOGETHER.
00:14:27.033,00:14:29.577,"WHEN YOU DON'T INVOLVE ME, WE'RE IN FREE-FALL."
00:14:29.661,00:14:32.205,"I SHOULD'VE CALLED YOU, AND I DIDN'T."
00:14:32.288,00:14:33.456,WHAT HAPPENED?
00:14:35.166,00:14:37.377,SHE SAYS THEY NEEDED TO KEEP ME IN CONGRESS.
00:14:37.460,00:14:38.670,LINDA SAID THAT?
00:14:38.753,00:14:39.879,WALKER WASN'T EVEN THERE.
00:14:39.962,00:14:41.548,THAT'S WHAT REALLY GETS ME.
00:14:41.631,00:14:43.383,HE DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO LOOK ME IN THE EYE.
00:14:43.466,00:14:45.218,I KNEW YOU SHOULDN'T TRUST THAT WOMAN.
00:14:45.301,00:14:46.845,I DIDN'T. I DON'T. I DON'T TRUST ANYONE.
00:14:46.927,00:14:48.888,THEN HOW COULD YOU NOT SEE THIS COMING?
00:14:50.598,00:14:52.726,I NEVER THOUGHT THEY WERE CAPABLE.
00:14:52.809,00:14:55.436,"YOU DON'T USUALLY UNDERESTIMATE PEOPLE, FRANCIS."
00:14:55.520,00:14:58.231,I KNOW.
00:14:58.314,00:15:00.859,HUBRIS. AMBITION.
00:15:00.941,00:15:02.109,YOU SHOULD BE ANGRY.
00:15:02.193,00:15:03.444,I'M LIVID.
00:15:03.528,00:15:05.363,THEN WHERE IS THAT? I DON'T SEE IT.
00:15:05.446,00:15:07.741,WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? SCREAM AND YELL? THROW A TANTRUM?
00:15:07.824,00:15:10.201,"I WANT MORE THAN I'M SEEING. YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS, FRANCIS."
00:15:10.284,00:15:13.287,"WELL, I'M SORRY, CLAIRE. I AM SORRY."
00:15:13.371,00:15:15.122,"NO, THAT I WON'T ACCEPT."
00:15:15.206,00:15:17.667,- WHAT? - APOLOGIES.
00:15:20.211,00:15:24.507,"MY HUSBAND DOESN'T APOLOGIZE, EVEN TO ME."
00:17:10.488,00:17:12.031,HOW LONG YOU BEEN UP?
00:17:12.114,00:17:13.574,HOURS.
00:17:16.285,00:17:18.412,I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
00:17:18.496,00:17:20.122,GOOD.
00:17:20.206,00:17:26.504,"WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF NIGHTS LIKE THIS-- MAKING PLANS, VERY LITTLE SLEEP."
00:17:26.587,00:17:28.882,I EXPECTED THAT.
00:17:28.965,00:17:31.217,IT DOESN'T WORRY ME.
00:17:40.434,00:17:42.770,I'D BETTER GET TO WORK.
00:17:42.854,00:17:46.232,I LAID A SUIT OUT FOR YOU UPSTAIRS.
00:17:46.315,00:17:48.401,THE NAVY-BLUE ONE.
00:17:54.323,00:17:55.742,I LOVE THAT WOMAN.
00:17:55.825,00:17:57.785,I LOVE HER MORE THAN SHARKS LOVE BLOOD.
00:18:05.334,00:18:07.795,WE'RE TOO GOOD. THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE US IN CONGRESS.
00:18:09.714,00:18:11.298,CHIN TUCK PROBABLY.
00:18:11.382,00:18:12.508,DEFINITELY DYES HIS HAIR.
00:18:14.343,00:18:15.386,DO WE SAY ANYTHING?
00:18:15.469,00:18:16.804,"NO. GOD, NO."
00:18:16.888,00:18:18.639,NOT UNLESS HE BRINGS IT UP.
00:18:20.349,00:18:21.726,- 9:20-- - CANCEL EVERYTHING.
00:18:21.809,00:18:23.937,"STAMPER, YOU'RE WITH ME."
00:18:24.020,00:18:25.396,"NOW, LOOK..."
00:18:29.650,00:18:32.070,WE ARE NO LONGER BOUND BY ALLEGIANCES.
00:18:32.152,00:18:33.905,WE SERVE NO ONE.
00:18:33.988,00:18:40.327,WE LIVE BY ONE RULE AND ONE RULE ONLY: NEVER AGAIN WILL WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE PUT IN SUCH A POSITION.
00:18:40.411,00:18:41.788,WALKER AND VASQUEZ.
00:18:41.871,00:18:44.916,ALL OF THEM. I HOLD THEM ALL ACCOUNTABLE.
00:18:44.999,00:18:47.334,- WANT RETRIBUTION? - NO. NO.
00:18:47.418,00:18:49.879,IT'S MORE THAN THAT.
00:18:49.963,00:18:52.298,TAKE A STEP BACK.
00:18:52.381,00:18:54.092,LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE.
00:18:54.174,00:18:56.803,I THINK I SEE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT.
00:18:56.886,00:18:58.262,KERN FIRST?
00:18:58.345,00:19:02.016,"THAT'S HOW YOU DEVOUR A WHALE, DOUG, ONE BITE AT A TIME."
00:19:04.310,00:19:05.937,GIVE ME A LIST OF CHOICES.
00:19:06.020,00:19:09.023,"AND HOWEVER WE DO THIS, WE'LL ALSO NEED A BUFFER."
00:19:09.107,00:19:10.524,YOU MEAN AN ERRAND BOY.
00:19:10.608,00:19:12.777,"YES, SOMEONE WE CONTROL COMPLETELY."
00:19:14.278,00:19:15.947,I'LL KEEP MY EAR TO THE GROUND.
00:19:16.030,00:19:17.406,GOOD.
00:19:17.490,00:19:20.159,I HAVEN'T EATEN SINCE YESTERDAY.
00:19:38.636,00:19:40.429,I ALMOST PITY HIM.
00:19:40.513,00:19:42.515,HE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BE PUT ON MY PLATTER.
00:19:42.598,00:19:48.771,"WHEN I CARVE HIM UP AND TOSS HIM TO THE DOGS, ONLY THEN WILL HE CONFRONT THAT BRUTAL, INESCAPABLE TRUTH..."
00:19:48.855,00:19:50.773,MY GOD.
00:19:50.857,00:19:54.276,ALL I EVER AMOUNTED TO WAS CHITLINS.

00:20:08.916,00:20:14.672,I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TODAY ON THE SUBJECT OF HUMILITY.
00:20:14.755,00:20:17.800,A LOT OF YOU HAVE JUST WON RE-ELECTION.
00:20:17.884,00:20:20.469,"IF YOU HADN'T, YOU MIGHT NOT BE SITTING HERE."
00:20:22.055,00:20:31.355,"AND, OF COURSE, WE SHOULD ENJOY OUR SUCCESS AND BE GRATEFUL FOR IT, BUT NEVER LET YOUR GRATITUDE SOUR INTO PRIDE."
00:20:31.438,00:20:46.537,"YOU'LL HAVE MANY CHALLENGES AHEAD OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS, AND A PERSON'S CHARACTER ISN'T DETERMINED BY HOW HE OR SHE ENJOYS VICTORY BUT RATHER HOW HE OR SHE ENDURES DEFEAT."
00:20:46.620,00:20:53.669,NOTHING CAN HELP US ENDURE DARK TIMES BETTER THAN OUR FAITH.
00:20:53.753,00:20:55.088,CLAIRE.

00:21:02.720,00:21:04.597,CHARLES AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WALKER WAS THINKING.
00:21:04.680,00:21:09.852,"OH, THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU, BUT REALLY BETWEEN YOU AND ME, I THINK FRANCIS IS RELIEVED."
00:21:09.936,00:21:13.480,HE JUST FEELS MUCH MORE AT HOME IN CONGRESS.
00:21:13.564,00:21:15.566,I WOULD'VE BET A MILLION DOLLARS THEY WERE GONNA PICK YOU.
00:21:15.649,00:21:18.819,"WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING YOU HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS TO SPARE."
00:21:18.903,00:21:21.280,"BUT YOU ARE, BY FAR AND AWAY, THE ONLY CHOICE."
00:21:21.363,00:21:23.199,I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT.
00:21:23.282,00:21:28.955,"I MEAN, MICHAEL? COME ON. HE'S GOT HALF THE EXPERIENCE-- GARRETT IS A SMART MAN. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING."
00:21:29.038,00:21:31.916,"YOU'RE A BIGGER MAN THAN I, FRANK."
00:22:02.488,00:22:05.825,"YOU, UH-- YOU WANT SOME OF THAT WINE?"
00:22:06.993,00:22:09.245,"YES, DEFINITELY."
00:22:15.251,00:22:17.503,"MAN, THIS IS SOME GOOD SHIT. WHERE'D YOU GET IT?"
00:22:17.586,00:22:23.717,"UH, I KIND OF LIFTED IT FROM THE V.I.P. ROOM OF THE SPEAKER'S HOLIDAY PARTY."
00:22:23.801,00:22:27.345,"I'M IMPRESSED. BORDEAUX, 20 YEARS OLD."
00:22:27.429,00:22:29.640,"OH, IT SEEMED ABOUT RIGHT FOR YOU."
00:22:29.723,00:22:32.310,OUCH. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT TO ME?
00:22:32.392,00:22:34.687,I'M ALMOST 30. THAT'S PRACTICALLY ANCIENT IN YOUR BOOK.
00:22:34.770,00:22:36.772,I DON'T DISCRIMINATE WHEN IT COMES TO AGE.
00:22:36.856,00:22:38.732,REALLY? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HIRED A 40-YEAR-OLD STAFFER?
00:22:38.816,00:22:40.609,DOESN'T MEAN I WOULDN'T.
00:22:40.693,00:22:42.236,"WELL, AS LONG AS SHE'S GOOD IN THE SACK."
00:22:42.320,00:22:44.905,"- COME ON. - WELL, IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?"
00:22:44.989,00:22:47.033,WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?
00:22:49.076,00:22:53.622,YOU'RE NOT GOING TO JUST TOSS ME ASIDE FOR SOME SLUT STRAIGHT OUT OF VASSAR.
00:22:53.706,00:22:55.875,"SO, WE'RE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION."
00:22:55.958,00:22:57.543,IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS.
00:22:57.626,00:22:59.045,IT'S NOT A LITTLE OFFICE FLING ANYMORE.
00:22:59.128,00:23:04.175,"YOU WANT ME TO SAY THOSE THREE MAGIC WORDS, ONE OF WHICH STARTS WITH AN L."
00:23:04.258,00:23:06.260,- MM-MM. NO. - OKAY.

00:23:45.799,00:23:48.886,"ARE WE PATRONS, BENEFACTORS, OR LEPERS?"
00:23:48.969,00:23:52.014,"BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WE'RE ANGELS."
00:23:57.686,00:24:00.022,I'M GOING TO GO OUTSIDE AND PRETEND TO USE MY CELL PHONE.
00:24:00.106,00:24:01.190,GO.

00:27:56.467,00:28:00.053,"I ADVISED THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AGAINST IT, BUT DONALD IS THE FACE OF EDUCATION."
00:28:00.137,00:28:02.264,HE'S BEEN PUSHING REFORM FOR 25 YEARS.
00:28:02.348,00:28:04.224,YOU WANT ME TO GUIDE HIM TO THE MIDDLE.
00:28:04.308,00:28:06.935,WE NEED A BILL WE CAN PASS.
00:28:07.019,00:28:09.938,DO I HAVE ABSOLUTE AUTONOMY AND AUTHORITY ON THIS?
00:28:10.022,00:28:11.815,THERE'S MORE.
00:28:11.898,00:28:15.361,GARRETT WANTS THE BILL ON THE FLOOR IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS.
00:28:15.444,00:28:19.031,HE WANTS TO MAKE A PLEDGE IN HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS.
00:28:19.114,00:28:20.658,"WELL, THAT'S..."
00:28:22.368,00:28:24.036,"THAT'S VERY AMBITIOUS, LINDA."

00:28:46.850,00:28:49.186,SHE THINKS I CAN BE BOUGHT WITH A PAIR OF TICKETS.
00:28:49.269,00:28:54.483,"WHAT AM I, A WHORE IN POST-WAR BERLIN, SALIVATING OVER FREE STOCKINGS AND CHOCOLATE?"
00:28:54.567,00:28:57.777,WHAT SHE'S ASKING WILL COST FAR MORE THAN THAT.
00:29:01.948,00:29:05.035,- WILLIS. - TOO STUPID.
00:29:05.118,00:29:08.330,- BOYD. - TOO QUEER.

00:29:10.583,00:29:12.626,HE'S MARRIED WITH THREE KIDS.
00:29:12.710,00:29:14.127,AND WOULDN'T THEY BE DEVASTATED?
00:29:14.211,00:29:18.131,ALL RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT CATHERINE DURANT?
00:29:18.215,00:29:19.966,CATHY DURANT?
00:29:20.050,00:29:22.094,SHE WAS VOCALLY ANTI-WALKER.
00:29:22.177,00:29:23.637,SHE'S GOT THE EXPERIENCE.
00:29:24.846,00:29:26.682,SET UP A MEETING.
00:29:30.644,00:29:32.104,HEY.

00:29:37.109,00:29:38.818,THE MONEY WILL HAVE TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.
00:29:38.902,00:29:41.447,"GOD, WHAT-- WHAT HAPPENED?"
00:29:41.530,00:29:46.702,"I'VE LOOKED OVER THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL '13, AND WE'VE ALLOCATED 1.6 MILLION FOR SALARIES."
00:29:46.785,00:29:48.704,WE NEED TO CUT THAT IN HALF.
00:29:48.787,00:29:52.666,"WELL, YOU'RE SUGGESTING-- EVELYN, WE'RE GOING TO LET SOME PEOPLE GO."
00:29:52.750,00:29:54.668,THAT WOULD BE HALF OF OUR STAFF.
00:29:54.752,00:29:56.295,WE HAVE TO CARVE OUT SOME ROOM.
00:29:56.378,00:30:01.508,BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIRE SOME ESSENTIAL PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN WITH US SINCE THE BEGINNING.
00:30:01.592,00:30:05.262,"WE ARE A CHARITY, BUT NOT FOR OUR EMPLOYEES."
00:30:05.345,00:30:11.769,"YOU KNOW, UM, CLAIRE, I HAVE HELD MY TONGUE ABOUT THIS WHOLE INTERNATIONAL THING FOR A WHILE, BUT I DON'T GET IT."
00:30:11.851,00:30:13.562,"I MEAN, WE ARE REALLY GOOD AT WHAT WE DO."
00:30:13.646,00:30:16.231,WHY DO WE HAVE TO TRY AND BE SOMETHING WE'RE NOT?
00:30:16.315,00:30:24.364,"BECAUSE WE'VE PLATEAUED, EVELYN, AND IT IS TIME FOR US, FOR OUR ENTIRE ORGANIZATION-- BUT DIGGING WELLS IN AFRICA? WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT."
00:30:24.448,00:30:27.284,WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE TO BRING IN NEW PEOPLE.
00:30:27.367,00:30:33.165,"THIS IS THE PLAN THAT I'VE PROPOSED TO THE BOARD, AND WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH IT."
00:30:33.248,00:30:37.002,"I'D LIKE A LIST OF NAMES, PLEASE."
00:30:37.085,00:30:39.505,"CLAIRE, COULD WE JUST THINK ABOUT THIS?"
00:30:39.588,00:30:41.298,I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
00:30:41.381,00:30:43.258,I'VE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO IT.

00:31:05.864,00:31:09.993,"NO. YOU GOTTA COME... SIR, I APOLOGIZE. THIS WOMAN-- - CONGRESSMAN. - MISS, STEP AWAY FROM THE DOOR."
00:31:10.076,00:31:13.664,- IF I COULD JUST HAVE ONE SECOND. - STEP AWAY FROM THE-- WHO ARE YOU?
00:31:13.747,00:31:15.457,MY NAME IS ZOE BARNES.
00:31:15.541,00:31:19.419,I'M A REPORTER AT THE WASHINGTON HERALD.
00:31:19.503,00:31:22.673,"IT IS AFTER 10:30 AT NIGHT, AND THIS IS MY HOME."
00:31:22.756,00:31:26.926,I DO NOT ALLOW ANY-- WE'RE PART OF A MUTUAL ADMIRATION SOCIETY.
00:31:30.305,00:31:32.015,YOU'RE A FAN OF THE SYMPHONY.
00:31:32.098,00:31:35.060,"WELL, MORE FOR THE PEOPLE WATCHING THAN THE MUSIC."
00:31:37.563,00:31:40.023,"IT'S ALL RIGHT, STEVE. COME ON IN, MISS BARNES."
00:31:56.039,00:31:57.374,IT'S STRONG.
00:31:57.457,00:31:59.000,DO YOU PREFER IT WEAK?
00:31:59.084,00:32:01.211,"NO. THE STRONGER, THE BETTER."
00:32:04.464,00:32:06.216,THERE'S NO HARM IN LOOKING.
00:32:08.427,00:32:11.722,IT'S CHEAP BUT EFFECTIVE.
00:32:11.805,00:32:14.725,"WELL, YOU CERTAINLY HAVE MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION."
00:32:14.808,00:32:20.063,"GOOD. THE REASON I'M HERE-- OH, IS FOREPLAY OVER?"
00:32:20.146,00:32:23.525,I READ SOMEWHERE THAT JFK NEVER LASTED MORE THAN THREE MINUTES.
00:32:23.609,00:32:24.777,THE POINT BEING?
00:32:24.860,00:32:26.403,TIME IS PRECIOUS.
00:32:26.486,00:32:28.864,POWERFUL PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF FOREPLAY.
00:32:28.947,00:32:32.033,"OKAY, SO WHY ARE YOU HERE, MISS BARNES?"
00:32:32.117,00:32:34.620,I NEED SOMEBODY I CAN TALK TO.
00:32:34.703,00:32:37.581,WE'RE TALKING. TELL ME WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
00:32:39.165,00:32:43.545,"I PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY, I PRINT WHATEVER YOU TELL ME, AND I'LL NEVER ASK ANY QUESTIONS."
00:32:43.629,00:32:47.466,AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I DON'T ALREADY HAVE SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WITH ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES?
00:32:47.549,00:32:51.261,"BECAUSE IF YOU DID, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LET ME THROUGH THE DOOR."
00:32:51.344,00:32:56.308,"I'VE LED A VERY LONG, VERY SUCCESSFUL CAREER AVOIDING THIS SORT OF INTRIGUE WITH THE PRESS."
00:32:56.391,00:32:58.518,I CAN'T SEE ANY ADVANTAGE IN STARTING NOW.
00:32:58.602,00:33:00.145,BUT IS THERE ANY DISADVANTAGE?
00:33:00.228,00:33:01.730,"SLOPPINESS, FOR ONE."
00:33:01.814,00:33:03.941,I PROMISE YOU ABSOLUTE DISCRETION.
00:33:04.065,00:33:06.735,"SO, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRUST."

00:33:08.654,00:33:10.530,"WORDS MATTER VERY MUCH, MISS BARNES."
00:33:10.614,00:33:12.741,"YOU SHOULD CARE MORE ABOUT THEM, GIVEN YOUR PROFESSION."

00:33:14.827,00:33:16.787,YOUR TRUST.
00:33:16.870,00:33:19.623,"SO, WHICH ZOE BARNES AM I TO TRUST?"
00:33:19.706,00:33:28.381,"THE ONE WHO WROTE ABOUT THE FIREMAN THAT MARRIED THE METER MAID, OR THE ONE WHO AUTHORED A VERY FINE ARTICLE ON A NEW JOGGING PATH IN ROCK CREEK PARK?"
00:33:28.465,00:33:30.342,DON'T BE FLATTERED. I READ EVERYTHING.
00:33:30.425,00:33:33.846,I'M BETTER THAN WHAT THEY HAVE ME DOING.
00:33:35.388,00:33:38.224,- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE. - DO I?
00:33:38.308,00:33:40.435,YOU'D HAVE MADE A GREAT SECRETARY OF STATE.
00:33:44.940,00:33:47.567,"HOW EXACTLY MAY I HELP YOU, MISS BARNES?"
00:33:49.736,00:33:54.658,"YOU MUST KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA, - WHAT'S COMING UP FIRST. - I MAY."
00:33:54.741,00:33:56.451,WILL YOU TELL ME?
00:33:56.535,00:33:58.954,WHAT WOULD BE YOUR GUESS?
00:34:00.873,00:34:02.791,- EDUCATION. - WHY?
00:34:02.875,00:34:05.210,IMMIGRATION IS TOO CONTROVERSIAL.
00:34:05.293,00:34:08.213,TAX REFORM ISN'T SEXY ENOUGH.
00:34:08.296,00:34:12.133,EVERYONE CAN GET BEHIND CHILDREN.
00:34:12.217,00:34:14.928,- IS IT EDUCATION? - YOU MIGHT VERY WELL THINK THAT.
00:34:15.012,00:34:17.180,I COULDN'T POSSIBLY COMMENT.
00:34:17.263,00:34:19.808,"- A HINT. - IT'S LATE, MISS BARNES."
00:34:19.892,00:34:24.103,- CAN WE TALK AGAIN? - I HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT I WANNA SLEEP ON ALL THIS.
00:34:24.187,00:34:29.484,I NEVER MAKE SUCH BIG DECISIONS SO LONG AFTER SUNSET AND SO FAR FROM DAWN.
00:34:34.489,00:34:36.449,MY CELL PHONE'S ON THE BACK.
00:34:36.533,00:34:38.284,DID YOU PUT MISS BARNES IN THE VISITORS' LEDGER?
00:34:38.368,00:34:39.828,NOT YET.
00:34:39.912,00:34:42.539,- DON'T. NEEDLESS TO SAY. - NEEDLESS.

00:36:00.408,00:36:02.661,I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE THE KING OF CHINA.
00:36:02.744,00:36:04.871,CHINA DOESN'T HAVE A KING.
00:36:04.955,00:36:08.083,IT'S A COMMUNIST AGUA-LARCHY.

00:37:10.062,00:37:12.189,WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
00:37:12.271,00:37:15.316,"I THOUGHT I WAS MEETING WITH THE CONGRESS-- NO, YOU'RE MEETING ME."
00:37:15.400,00:37:17.736,IT'S 4:00 IN THE GODDAMN MORNING.

00:37:26.119,00:37:29.372,"MAYOR OF D.C. WOULD LOOK GOOD ON THAT RESUME, WOULDN'T IT?"
00:37:29.455,00:37:32.667,WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN ANGLING TO RUN FOR SOME TIME.
00:37:32.751,00:37:34.836,EXPERIENCE IS YOUR STRONG SUIT.

00:39:17.147,00:39:19.024,HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO GET THAT THROUGH A COMMITTEE?
00:39:19.107,00:39:22.401,"WHEN LINDA TOLD ME TO WRITE IT, SHE PROMISED-- I'M SURE SHE SAID ANY NUMBER OF THINGS."
00:39:22.485,00:39:24.070,"FORGET WHAT THEY PROMISED YOU, DONALD."
00:39:24.154,00:39:27.073,THEY WANT YOUR NAME BECAUSE IT CARRIES WEIGHT.
00:39:27.157,00:39:28.783,"WELL, MY NAME COMES WITH MY IDEAS."
00:39:28.867,00:39:30.535,"I UNDERSTAND, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE REASONABLE."
00:39:30.618,00:39:31.995,THIS ISN'T THE GREAT DEBATE.
00:39:32.078,00:39:34.455,IT'S ABOUT PASSING MEANINGFUL REFORM.
00:39:34.539,00:39:38.668,"MAYBE NOT EVERYTHING YOU WOULD'VE HOPED, BUT HELP ME HELP YOU."
00:39:38.751,00:39:40.586,THAT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME.

00:39:55.060,00:39:58.938,TOGETHER WE'RE GOING TO DO MORE THAN YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO IN 25 YEARS.
00:40:03.318,00:40:07.780,TWO THINGS ARE NOW IRRELEVANT: DONALD BLYTHE AND DONALD BLYTHE'S NEW DRAFT.
00:40:07.864,00:40:09.866,EVENTUALLY I'LL HAVE TO REWRITE THE BILL MYSELF.
00:40:09.949,00:40:11.868,FORWARD! THAT IS THE BATTLE CRY.
00:40:11.951,00:40:14.079,LEAVE IDEOLOGY TO THE ARMCHAIR GENERALS.

00:40:16.039,00:40:18.624,WALKER JUST NOMINATED KERN.
00:40:18.708,00:40:21.378,IT'S A LONG ROAD TO CONFIRMATION.
00:40:21.460,00:40:24.089,- KERN IS A BOY SCOUT. - NOBODY'S A BOY SCOUT.
00:40:24.172,00:40:25.631,NOT EVEN BOY SCOUTS.

00:40:34.724,00:40:36.268,DOES THE JOB INTEREST YOU?
00:40:38.144,00:40:40.646,WHY WOULD YOU WANT MICHAEL GONE?
00:40:40.730,00:40:42.774,"CATHY, YOU AND I CAME UP TOGETHER."
00:40:42.857,00:40:48.321,"THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE NEEDS A SECRETARY WE CAN WORK WITH, SOMEONE WHO ISN'T AFRAID TO STAND UP TO WALKER WHEN HE'S WRONG."
00:40:48.405,00:40:50.407,WE NEED YOU.
00:40:54.869,00:40:56.829,LET'S ASSUME I AM INTERESTED.
00:40:56.913,00:40:58.539,I DON'T WANT TO ASSUME.
00:40:58.623,00:41:01.084,I WANT TO KNOW.
00:41:45.378,00:41:46.712,2-6-3-7.

00:42:17.618,00:42:22.581,SO SORRY. I COULDN'T CATCH A CAB. I HAD TO TAKE A TRAIN-- JUST BEFORE YOU LEFT MY HOUSE...
00:42:22.665,00:42:24.209,THINK BACK...

00:42:49.942,00:42:52.820,- DONALD BLYTHE? - CORRECT. THE PROBLEM IS...
00:42:52.904,00:42:55.656,HE'S AN OLD-SCHOOL TAX-AND-SPEND LIBERAL.
00:42:55.740,00:42:58.201,WALKER RAN AS A MODERATE.
00:42:59.869,00:43:01.954,YOU THINK BLYTHE WOULD TALK TO ME?
00:43:07.001,00:43:09.337,WAIT. WE'RE IN A VERY GRAY AREA.
00:43:09.421,00:43:14.384,"ETHICALLY, LEGALLY, WHICH I'M OKAY WITH-- I JUST LOVE THIS PAINTING. DON'T YOU?"
00:43:16.177,00:43:18.513,"WE'RE IN THE SAME BOAT NOW, ZOE."
00:43:18.596,00:43:20.139,TAKE CARE NOT TO TIP IT OVER.
00:43:20.223,00:43:22.850,I CAN ONLY SAVE ONE OF US FROM DROWNING.
00:43:49.919,00:43:52.338,HE ANNOUNCES HIS EDUCATION INITIATIVE ON MONDAY.
00:43:52.422,00:43:54.757,- HALF OF THE ADDRESS IS BASED ON-- - I UNDERSTAND.
00:43:54.840,00:43:57.009,"- DO WE NEED TO TAKE IT OUT? - WE'RE FINE, LINDA."
00:43:57.093,00:43:59.471,BUT YOU JUST GOT THROUGH SAYING HE HAS TO START OVER.
00:43:59.554,00:44:01.556,I DIDN'T CHOOSE BLYTHE. YOU DID.
00:44:01.639,00:44:04.225,"YOU PUT HIM IN MY LAP AND ASKED ME TO WORK A MIRACLE, AND I WILL."
00:44:04.309,00:44:06.144,"NOW, HAVE A LITTLE FAITH, LINDA."
00:44:06.227,00:44:07.853,LET ME WORK WITH DONALD ON THIS.
00:44:07.937,00:44:10.607,I KNOW WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN 100 DAYS.

00:05:55.396,00:05:56.982,ON OUR FIRST DAY IN OFFICE.
00:05:57.065,00:05:58.733,"LINDA, I'VE WORKED WITH FOUR PRESIDENTS."
00:05:58.817,00:06:00.777,SETBACKS ARE A DIME A DOZEN WITH A BILL OF THIS SIZE.
00:06:00.861,00:06:04.447,"FRANK, IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL THIS-- I DON'T TAKE WELL TO BEING MICROMANAGED, LINDA."
00:06:04.531,00:06:07.242,YOU WANT TO DO MY JOB FOR ME AND RUN THE WHITE HOUSE?
00:06:07.326,00:06:09.286,GOOD LUCK. I WON'T STAND IN YOUR WAY.
00:06:09.368,00:06:12.747,"OKAY, FRANK. FINE. THIS IS YOURS NOW."
00:06:12.831,00:06:18.712,"IF THIS THING CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE FLOOR IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS, THEN I'LL LET YOU EXPLAIN TO THE PRESIDENT WHY HE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE."
00:06:18.795,00:06:20.172,I'M GONNA GET BACK TO WORK.
00:06:20.255,00:06:21.422,PLEASE DO.
00:06:42.986,00:06:44.071,INSTEAD OF A WEDNESDAY.
00:06:44.154,00:06:49.826,"IF WE DO IT ON A FRIDAY, IS ALL THE PAPERWORK READY?"
00:06:52.204,00:06:53.872,THERE'S SEVERANCE.
00:06:53.955,00:06:55.414,BUT WE SHOULDN'T RUN INTO ANY LEGAL ISSUES.
00:06:55.498,00:07:00.545,"NO, NO. WE USE AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS ACROSS THE BOARD."
00:07:00.628,00:07:02.339,"WELL, GET STARTED FIRST THING FRIDAY."
00:07:02.421,00:07:06.760,I WANT ALL OF THE EXIT INTERVIEWS DONE BY LUNCH.
00:07:06.843,00:07:10.471,"CLAIRE, I JUST CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT THIS IS A MISTAKE."
00:07:10.555,00:07:12.140,"WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS ALREADY, EVELYN."
00:07:12.224,00:07:16.228,"I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT I JUST HAVE TO SAY IT FOR THE SAKE OF MY CONSCIENCE."
00:07:16.311,00:07:36.456,"I THINK THAT YOU ARE DISMANTLING WHAT WE HAVE BUILT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, AND I-- AND I THINK THE WAY YOU'RE HANDLING THIS IS... IS CRUEL."
00:07:36.539,00:07:37.749,"IT'S NOT EASY, EVELYN."
00:07:39.459,00:07:40.961,BUT IT'S NECESSARY.
00:07:41.044,00:07:44.505,YOU HAVE ALWAYS ASKED ME TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
00:07:44.589,00:07:46.258,IT'S HOW WE WORK TOGETHER.
00:07:46.341,00:07:48.551,"I DISAGREE WITH SOMETHING, I SAY IT."
00:07:48.635,00:07:51.972,"WELL, I DISAGREE 100%."
00:07:52.055,00:07:54.515,"PLEASE, CLAIRE, DON'T DO THIS."
00:07:54.599,00:08:01.606,"I RESPECT YOUR OPINION, EVELYN, AND I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING IT WITH ME, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND."
00:08:04.609,00:08:05.610,"FRIDAY, THEN."
00:08:08.488,00:08:09.781,IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.
00:08:17.664,00:08:20.417,"THIS IS MAJOR REFORM, A COMPLETE OVERHAUL."
00:08:20.500,00:08:22.461,THAT WOULD USUALLY TAKE MONTHS.
00:08:22.543,00:08:24.463,"WELL, WE ONLY HAVE DAYS, NOT MONTHS."
00:08:24.545,00:08:36.975,"BUT THINK ABOUT THE PROCESS. WE CAN'T JUST CHANGE-- WHEN I ASK MY COLLEAGUES, YOUR BOSSES, WHO ARE THE SMARTEST MINDS IN EDUCATION, OUT OF HUNDREDS, WE ARRIVED AT YOU-- THE SIX OF YOU IN THIS ROOM."
00:08:37.058,00:08:41.813,"NOW, I REALIZE IT IS A DIFFICULT TASK, BUT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE HISTORY HERE."
00:08:41.896,00:08:45.775,AND I WANT ALL OF US TO MAKE IT TOGETHER.
00:08:45.859,00:08:47.944,SO GOOD LUCK. WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU.
00:08:49.654,00:08:50.697,PAGE 1.
00:08:50.780,00:08:55.160,THESE BULLET POINTS REFLECT THE KEY PLANKS AT THE CENTER OF OUR BILL.
00:08:55.243,00:08:58.497,GET COMFY. THIS IS YOUR HOME UNTIL WE HAVE A PRESENTABLE FIRST DRAFT.
00:09:02.209,00:09:04.211,"DONALD, WHAT A MORNING."
00:09:04.294,00:09:05.962,I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THEY GOT THIS.
00:09:06.046,00:09:10.717,I SPECIFICALLY TOLD MY STAFF TO DESTROY EVERYTHING. I CAN'T IMAGINE-- IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW IT HAPPENED.
00:09:10.800,00:09:12.886,"WE CAN'T MAKE IT UNHAPPEN, SO WE HAVE TO ADAPT."
00:09:12.969,00:09:14.846,DON'T THEY REALIZE THAT THIS IS A FIRST DRAFT?
00:09:14.929,00:09:16.806,ALL WE HAVE HERE REALLY IS A PERCEPTION PROBLEM.
00:09:16.890,00:09:19.351,"WE DON'T GET A SECOND CHANCE AT A FIRST IMPRESSION, DONALD."
00:09:19.434,00:09:24.189,"YOU KNOW THAT. NOW, LOOK, I'M ON YOUR SIDE, BUT LINDA IS FURIOUS."
00:09:24.272,00:09:25.606,WHAT'S SHE SAYING?
00:09:25.690,00:09:27.567,THEY WANT TO POINT FINGERS.
00:09:27.650,00:09:28.818,AT ME?
00:09:28.902,00:09:30.362,I TOLD HER WE CANNOT DO THAT.
00:09:30.445,00:09:32.280,"I MEAN, YOU ARE VITAL TO THIS PROCESS."
00:09:32.364,00:09:37.952,"I'M UP TO HERE WITH THEM, DONALD-- FOR LYING, FOR TURNING THEIR BACK ON YOU."
00:09:38.036,00:09:40.497,"YOU KNOW, I'M OF A MIND TO SAY SCREW IT."
00:09:40.580,00:09:44.709,"I'LL FALL ON THIS GRENADE MYSELF, JUST TO PISS THEM OFF."
00:09:44.792,00:09:46.461,GIVE ME JOHN KING AT CNN.
00:09:46.545,00:09:48.171,"WAIT, FRANK. THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT."
00:09:48.255,00:09:50.382,"NO, WE HAVE TO PROTECT YOUR REPUTATION."
00:09:50.465,00:09:52.217,BUT YOU'RE THE MAN THAT NEEDS TO GET THE BILL THROUGH THE HOUSE.
00:09:52.300,00:09:57.222,"I WILL-- HANG ON. I WILL ASSIGN IT TO ONE OF MY DEPUTIES, QUIETLY MANAGE IT, AND HELP GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS."
00:09:57.305,00:09:58.932,I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS.
00:09:59.015,00:10:01.518,"WELL, THEN WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO?"
00:10:03.520,00:10:14.697,"WHAT A MARTYR CRAVES MORE THAN ANYTHING IS A SWORD TO FALL ON, SO YOU SHARPEN THE BLADE, HOLD IT AT JUST THE RIGHT ANGLE, AND THEN 3, 2, 1-- IT SHOULD BE ME."
00:10:14.781,00:10:15.949,IT WAS MY BILL.
00:10:16.032,00:10:20.703,"NO. IMPOSSIBLE. DONALD, EDUCATION HAS BEEN YOUR LIFE'S WORK."
00:10:23.331,00:10:26.501,THE TRUTH IS MY HEART IS NOT IN THIS FIGHT.
00:10:26.585,00:10:29.463,YOU KNOW ME. I'M NOT A WHEELER DEALER.
00:10:29.546,00:10:33.883,"I CAN PUT MY MIND TO POLICY, BUT I'M NO GOOD AT THIS BRAND OF POLITICS."
00:10:33.967,00:10:36.386,"WELL, IF NOT YOU, THEN WHO?"
00:10:41.849,00:10:44.144,"IT SHOULD BE YOU, FRANK."
00:10:44.227,00:10:46.438,YOU'RE FORMIDABLE. PEOPLE RESPECT YOU.
00:10:46.521,00:10:50.066,THEY WILL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD. LET ME-- LET ME BE ON THE SIDELINES FOR THIS.
00:10:54.779,00:11:01.411,"WELL, I COULD ONLY CONSIDER THAT AS AN OPTION IF I KNEW THAT I COULD STILL COME TO YOU FOR COUNSEL."
00:11:01.495,00:11:04.581,OF COURSE. WHATEVER YOU NEED.
00:11:06.541,00:11:09.919,PART OF ME IS GLAD THIS GOT LEAKED.
00:11:12.088,00:11:17.135,"WELL, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IT HADN'T, BUT AT LEAST PEOPLE KNOW WHERE I STAND."
00:11:19.346,00:11:20.388,"THANK YOU, DONALD."
00:11:20.472,00:11:21.848,"HAPPY TO DO IT, FRANK."
00:11:28.729,00:11:32.567,HE HAS NO IDEA WE'VE GOT SIX KIDS IN THE NEXT ROOM ALREADY WORKING ON A NEW DRAFT.
00:11:32.651,00:11:35.111,STAMPER! BUT WHY DAMPEN HIS MOOD BY TELLING HIM?
00:11:35.195,00:11:38.615,WE JUST GAVE HIM A GREAT GIFT-- THE CHANCE TO FULFILL HIS DESTINY.
00:11:38.697,00:11:43.911,"WRITE UP A STATEMENT FOR BLYTHE-- STEPPING ASIDE, FRESH IDEAS, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, AND MAKE IT DIGNIFIED."
00:11:43.995,00:11:45.163,HE'S A GOOD MAN.
00:11:45.246,00:11:47.541,OH. AND BRING ME THAT WILLIAMS EDITORIAL.
00:11:51.836,00:11:58.343,"AFTER CAREFUL THOUGHT AND DISCUSSION WITH MY STAFF, I AM RELINQUISHING MY MANAGEMENT OF THE EDUCATION REFORM ACT."
00:11:58.426,00:12:08.853,"I HOPE TO REMAIN A PART OF THE PROCESS, BUT I WON'T BE WORKING-- I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW IT GOT LEAKED, BUT, UH, IT DOES REPRESENT-- IT CAME FROM YOUR OFFICE, THOUGH, CORRECT?"
00:12:08.936,00:12:11.772,"UH, WE WROTE IT, BUT I DON'T-- WHO'LL BE MANAGING THE BILL NOW?"
00:12:11.856,00:12:12.857,FRANK UNDERWOOD.
00:12:14.442,00:12:18.988,OR DID THE ADMINISTRATION-- I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT PLACING THE BILL IN FRANK'S CAPABLE HANDS.
00:12:57.277,00:12:58.486,MS. BARNES.
00:12:58.570,00:13:00.196,HOW VERY DEEP THROAT OF YOU.
00:13:00.280,00:13:02.990,"WELL, I CAN'T HELP YOU DISPATCH A PRESIDENT."
00:13:03.074,00:13:04.409,HOW ABOUT A SENATOR?
00:13:04.492,00:13:06.327,THE EDITORIAL ON THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS.
00:13:06.411,00:13:13.834,IT IS THE OPINION OF THIS NEWSPAPER THAT PRESIDENT CARTER DEMAND ISRAEL WITHDRAW ALL ITS CITIZENS FROM THE GAZA STRIP AND WEST BANK.
00:13:13.918,00:13:16.755,WHICH IT HAS ILLEGALLY OCCUPIED SINCE 1967.
00:13:16.837,00:13:18.839,ILLEGALLY OCCUPIED.
00:13:18.923,00:13:20.258,"THAT'S QUITE AN INCENDIARY QUOTE, DON'T YOU THINK?"
00:13:20.341,00:13:24.345,FOR AN ADMINISTRATION THAT SAYS THAT THE MIDDLE EAST IS ITS TOP FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITY.
00:13:24.429,00:13:25.722,MICHAEL KERN?
00:13:25.804,00:13:27.932,DID HE PERSONALLY WRITE THE EDITORIAL?
00:13:28.015,00:13:29.850,HE WAS THE EDITOR.
00:13:29.934,00:13:31.436,BUT DID HE WRITE IT HIMSELF?
00:13:33.688,00:13:35.482,THEN THERE'S NO STORY.
00:13:35.565,00:13:38.859,I'M SAYING IT'S A QUESTION WORTH ASKING.
00:13:38.943,00:13:40.819,AND IF HE DENIES INVOLVEMENT?
00:13:40.903,00:13:42.405,HE WILL. LET HIM.
00:13:42.489,00:13:46.200,THIS IS A MAN TRYING TO BE CONFIRMED AS SECRETARY OF STATE.
00:13:46.284,00:13:47.910,EVERYTHING IS A STORY.
00:13:47.994,00:13:49.454,THERE'S NO DIRECT LINK.
00:13:49.537,00:13:52.957,I CAN'T GET THIS PAST HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:13:53.040,00:14:00.674,"REMEMBER THIS MOMENT WHEN YOU RESISTED ME, WHEN YOU SAID THE WORDS THEN THERE IS NO STORY."
00:14:02.759,00:14:04.843,"GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, MS. BARNES."
00:14:04.927,00:14:06.596,YOU HAVE A BIG DAY TOMORROW.
00:14:29.661,00:14:30.704,FRANCIS?
00:14:41.798,00:14:44.425,WHAT IS THIS?
00:14:45.635,00:14:47.303,BUT THE BASEMENT IS MINE.
00:14:47.387,00:14:49.764,I KNOW. IT'S NOT FOR ME.
00:14:49.848,00:14:50.973,SO WHO'S IT FOR?
00:14:51.057,00:14:52.266,FOR YOU.
00:14:52.350,00:14:53.976,THERE'S A GYM IN THE CAPITOL.
00:14:54.060,00:14:55.520,WHICH YOU NEVER USE.
00:14:55.603,00:14:57.480,BECAUSE I'M A TAD BUSY RUNNING THE COUNTRY.
00:14:57.564,00:14:59.649,"BUT NOT AT HOME, SO NOW YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE."
00:14:59.733,00:15:00.817,I WANT IT OUT.
00:15:00.900,00:15:02.151,GIVE IT A TRY FIRST.
00:15:02.235,00:15:06.197,IS THIS YOUR SUBTLE WAY OF SAYING THAT I'M OUT OF SHAPE?
00:15:06.280,00:15:09.075,"NO, IT'S MY WAY OF SUGGESTING YOU COULD BE IN BETTER SHAPE."
00:15:09.158,00:15:12.370,THAT SOUNDS BOTH PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE AND CONDESCENDING.
00:15:12.453,00:15:13.454,JUST PLAIN AGGRESSIVE AND TRUE.
00:15:13.538,00:15:14.831,DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME.
00:15:14.914,00:15:16.123,ARE YOU GOING RUNNING NOW?
00:15:17.709,00:15:18.918,"YES, BECAUSE I COULDN'T THIS MORNING."
00:15:19.001,00:15:20.461,I HAD AN EARLY MEETING.
00:15:20.545,00:15:23.047,USE THE MONSTROSITY. IT'S FREEZING OUT.
00:15:23.130,00:15:24.716,YOU BREAK IT IN.
00:15:28.052,00:15:30.471,"IT LOOKS POSITIVELY MEDIEVAL, DOESN'T IT?"
00:15:30.555,00:15:33.474,AND TO TURN MY ONLY SANCTUARY INTO A FITNESS DUNGEON.
00:15:33.558,00:15:34.642,I WON'T HAVE IT.
00:15:39.188,00:15:41.274,- HE WAS THE EDITOR. - DID YOU CALL FOR A COMMENT?
00:15:41.357,00:15:43.401,I TRIED THREE TIMES. THE PRESS SECRETARY SAID HE'D GET BACK TO ME.
00:15:43.484,00:15:45.403,- HE DIDN'T. - WHAT ABOUT RESEARCH?
00:15:45.486,00:15:46.946,YOU COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING TO ECHO THE EDITORIAL?
00:15:47.029,00:15:48.615,"NO QUOTES, NO OP-ED PIECES?"
00:15:48.698,00:15:52.034,"DON'T YOU THINK IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT EXISTED, SOMEONE WOULD HAVE PRINTED IT BY NOW?"
00:15:52.118,00:15:53.536,"NOBODY ELSE HAS THIS, LUCAS."
00:15:53.620,00:15:55.371,I DON'T THINK THERE'S A STORY HERE.
00:15:55.455,00:15:58.958,I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S A STORY. ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT THERE'S A QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED.
00:16:00.668,00:16:02.879,THIS IS A NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.
00:16:02.962,00:16:05.131,WE HAVE AN EDITORIAL ON PALESTINE AND ISRAEL.
00:16:05.214,00:16:06.633,WHICH HE DIDN'T WRITE.
00:16:06.716,00:16:08.468,WHICH WE DON'T KNOW HE DIDN'T WRITE.
00:16:08.551,00:16:10.010,EXACTLY.
00:16:10.094,00:16:11.178,WE DON'T HAVE TO PRINT IT.
00:16:11.262,00:16:14.265,"I COULD JUST SCAN THE THING, STICK IT ON A SITE, AND TWEET THE LINK."
00:16:14.348,00:16:17.977,"BUT IF I DID THAT, SOME OTHER PAPER MIGHT-- WHOA, WHOA. DON'T BE A BITCH."
00:16:19.979,00:16:21.021,I'LL TALK TO TOM.
00:16:21.105,00:16:22.982,THAT'S ALL I WAS ASKING.
00:16:23.065,00:16:26.444,WE SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO ALLOW THE-- WE GOT A GUY WHO'S ALMOST PERFECT.
00:16:26.527,00:16:30.072,HE'S A LIBERTARIAN DRUG FIEND - MARINATING IN A MOBILE HOME. - SHH.
00:16:30.156,00:16:40.917,"I DIDN'T AGREE WITH PRESIDENT REAGAN ON MANY THINGS, BUT THERE WAS SOME MERIT TO THE NOTION OF TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS, AND I FEEL THERE IS MUCH MERIT TO THE IDEA OF TRICKLE-DOWN DIPLOMACY."
00:16:41.000,00:16:42.585,THOSE ARE MY LINES.
00:16:42.669,00:16:44.253,VASQUEZ MUST HAVE GIVEN THEM TO HIM.
00:16:44.337,00:17:15.117,"...STALEMATE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND PALESTINE, THAT SUCCESS WILL TRICKLE DOWN TO A HUNDRED OTHER DIPLOMATIC DILEMMAS BETWEEN MUSLIMS, JEWS, CHRISTIANS-- I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP ISRAEL AND PALESTINE BECAUSE JUST BEFORE WE CAME ON THE AIR, I RECEIVED AN ADVANCE COPY OF AN ARTICLE THAT'S GOING TO BE IN TOMORROW'S WASHINGTON HERALD'S FRONT PAGE AND WAS WRITTEN BY ZOE BARNES, AND IN IT SHE QUOTES AN EDITORIAL THAT RAN IN THE WILLIAMS COLLEGE REGISTER WHEN YOU WERE EDITOR BACK IN SEPTEMBER 1978, WHICH CALLED THE ISRAELI PRESENCE IN THE GAZA STRIP AND WEST BANK, QUOTE, AN ILLEGAL OCCUPATION."
00:17:15.201,00:17:16.995,- CAN I SEE THAT? - SURE.
00:17:17.077,00:17:19.163,"DID YOU WRITE THOSE WORDS, ILLEGAL OCCUPATION?"
00:17:21.165,00:17:22.834,BUT YOU WERE THE EDITOR OF THE PAPER.
00:17:24.418,00:17:27.046,SO IT COULDN'T HAVE GONE OUT WITHOUT YOUR APPROVAL.
00:17:27.129,00:17:36.806,"NO, OF COURSE NOT, BUT MY STAFF-- SOMEBODY ELSE USUALLY WROTE THE, UH, THE, UH-- AND THEN WE'D VOTE, AND IF-- IT WAS 35 YEARS AGO."
00:17:36.890,00:17:43.897,SO YOU'RE NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT YOU SUPPORTED THESE WORDS-- I CAN TELL YOU WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT I DID NOT WRITE THESE WORDS.
00:17:43.980,00:17:46.566,BUT WERE THEY IN LINE WITH YOUR THINKING AT THE TIME?
00:17:49.193,00:17:51.571,THAT'S ALL WE NEED-- HIM LAUGHING.
00:17:53.364,00:17:55.033,"NANCY, GET ME DENNIS MENDEL AT THE ADL."
00:17:55.115,00:17:57.577,THE MIDDLE EAST IS A VITAL AMERICAN INTEREST.
00:17:57.660,00:17:59.620,WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST IS RELEVANT.
00:18:01.873,00:18:06.377,EVERY SINGLE VOTE HAS BEEN IN DEFENSE OF ISRAEL-- SO WHEN DID YOUR VIEWS CHANGE?
00:18:06.460,00:18:17.764,"WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS MY-- WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW, GEORGE, IS HOW I HAVE VOTED WHILE I HAVE REPRESENTED THE GREAT STATE OF COLORADO-- I UNDERSTAND THAT'S YOUR POSITION, BUT A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT IT AND THINK WHAT YOU THOUGHT THEN IS RELEVANT AS WELL."
00:18:17.847,00:18:22.769,HAVE YOU EVER CHANGED YOUR VIEWS - SINCE COLLEGE? - I'M NOT THE NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.
00:18:22.852,00:18:26.272,"UH, EVEN IF I DID HAVE-- IT'S GOLDEN."
00:18:26.355,00:18:29.025,THIS HAS NOT BEEN MY VIEWS-- IT'S A BULL'S EYE.

00:33:53.031,00:33:55.575,WE'VE GOT SPACE FOR POLITICAL IF WE NEED IT.
00:33:55.659,00:33:58.119,"JANINE, ANYTHING NEW ON MICHAEL KERN?"
00:33:58.203,00:33:59.746,THE WHITE HOUSE IS DODGING.
00:33:59.830,00:34:02.374,YOU CAN'T GET ANYONE ON RECORD?
00:34:02.457,00:34:04.001,NOT JUST ME.
00:34:04.083,00:34:06.044,THEY'RE SHUTTING ALL OF US DOWN IN THE BRIEFINGS.
00:34:06.127,00:34:08.839,"NO ONE IS GIVING AN INCH, EVEN ON BACKGROUND."
00:34:08.922,00:34:12.551,"IN THE MEANTIME, I'M WORKING ON A FEATURE ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S FOREIGN POLICY AGENDA."
00:34:12.634,00:34:16.638,"HOW IT SHIFTED FROM THE START OF THE CAMPAIGN, - INCREASED D.O.D. SPENDING, AND-- - WE SEE YOU, ZOE."
00:34:16.722,00:34:20.225,I CAN LINK KERN DIRECTLY TO THE WILLIAMS EDITORIAL.
00:34:20.308,00:34:24.771,- WHAT? - I'VE GOT A GUY NAMED ROY KAPENIAK WHO WAS ON THE EDITORIAL STAFF WHEN KERN WAS THERE.
00:34:24.855,00:34:26.606,"HEY, TWITTER TWAT, W.T.F.?"
00:34:26.690,00:34:28.775,"- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. ROY WHAT? - KAPENIAK."
00:34:28.859,00:34:30.402,A CLASSMATE OF KERN'S.
00:34:30.485,00:34:35.198,I HAVE HIM ON RECORD SAYING KERN WROTE EVERY WORD - OF THE EDITORIAL. - LET'S MOVE THIS INTO MY OFFICE.
00:34:35.281,00:34:36.408,"ZOE, LUCAS."
00:34:47.419,00:34:53.675,"LET ME-- LET ME, ONCE AND FOR ALL, SAY THIS DEFINITIVELY: I DIDN'T AUTHOR THAT EDITORIAL."
00:34:53.759,00:34:57.054,"NOT A SINGLE SENTENCE, WORD, COMMA, OR PERIOD."
00:34:57.136,00:35:00.139,"IF MEMORY SERVES ME, IT WAS MR. KAPENIAK WHO WROTE IT."
00:35:00.223,00:35:03.560,WHY ON EARTH HE'S TRYING TO CLAIM THAT I DID IS BEYOND ME.
00:35:03.643,00:35:07.064,LET ME FURTHER SAY THAT I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL.
00:35:07.146,00:35:13.028,AS THE MOST STABLE COUNTRY IN THE REGION - AND OUR STRONGEST ALLY... - IT'S FRANK UNDERWOOD FOR CATHY.
00:35:13.111,00:35:18.992,"...IN ANY PEACE PROCESS, BECAUSE WITHOUT THE STABILITY OF ISRAEL, THERE CAN BE NO PALESTINE."
00:35:24.539,00:35:26.792,WITHOUT ISRAEL THERE CAN BE NO PALESTINE?
00:35:26.875,00:35:32.672,- I'VE GOT IT ON. - I WOULD REMIND SENATOR KERN THAT THERE WAS A PALESTINE LONG BEFORE THERE WAS AN ISRAEL.
00:35:32.756,00:35:35.801,"HIS COMMENTS ARE NOT ONLY IGNORANT, THEY ARE RACIST."
00:35:35.884,00:35:39.262,"GET READY, CATHY. THINGS ARE ABOUT TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY."
00:35:39.345,00:35:41.389,- ...UNDERSTANDING OF THE MIDDLE EAST... - OKAY.
00:35:41.473,00:35:43.266,- ...IS SO OUT OF SYNC WITH REALITY... - I'M READY.
00:35:45.644,00:35:47.687,"- PETER? NO. STOP. - UH, NOT NOW."
00:35:47.771,00:35:49.898,"HEY. HEY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?"
00:35:51.316,00:35:53.986,"OH, GOD, YOU'RE FUCKING HIGH."
00:35:54.069,00:35:55.988,"- NO. I-- - YES, YOU ARE. LOOK AT YOUR EYES."
00:35:56.071,00:35:58.490,"OH, PLEASE, JUST LAY OFF."
00:35:58.573,00:36:02.410,YOU PROMISED ME IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE THIS.
00:36:02.494,00:36:05.622,CANCEL WHATEVER I HAVE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.
00:36:42.784,00:36:44.703,KERN IS OUT.
00:36:44.786,00:36:46.705,THEY'RE TOSSING HIM?
00:36:46.788,00:36:49.624,"TECHNICALLY, HE'LL WITHDRAW HIMSELF, BUT YES."
00:36:49.708,00:36:51.793,CAN I SAY A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE?
00:36:51.877,00:36:54.295,NO. YOU LET THIS STORY PLAY OUT IN ITS OWN TIME.
00:36:54.379,00:36:56.006,THEY'LL ANNOUNCE IN THE MORNING.
00:36:56.089,00:36:59.009,"I'M SORRY. IF NOT THAT, WHAT STORY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?"
00:36:59.092,00:37:01.094,CATHERINE DURANT.
00:37:01.178,00:37:04.723,"AS SOON AS KERN WITHDRAWS, YOU SAY SHE'LL BE THE REPLACEMENT."
00:37:04.806,00:37:07.475,- IS THAT TRUE? - IT WILL BE AFTER YOU WRITE IT.
00:37:09.019,00:37:10.979,ROY KAPENIAK WAS YOU.
00:37:11.063,00:37:14.649,YOU MIGHT VERY WELL THINK THAT. I COULDN'T POSSIBLY COMMENT.
00:37:14.733,00:37:16.651,YOU FOUND HIM. YOU HAD HIM CALL ME.
00:37:16.735,00:37:19.237,"KAPENIAK AND KERN WERE APPETIZERS, MISS BARNES."
00:37:19.320,00:37:21.823,CATHERINE DURANT IS THE MEAL.
00:37:23.366,00:37:26.953,SAY THAT NAME: CATHERINE DURANT.
00:37:27.037,00:37:29.122,SAY IT OVER AND OVER.
00:37:29.206,00:37:37.964,"TOMORROW AFTERNOON, WRITE IT DOWN, AND THEN WATCH THAT NAME COME OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES."
00:37:38.048,00:37:40.675,THIS IS WHERE WE GET TO CREATE.
00:37:47.557,00:37:49.475,"DON'T MISS YOUR TRAIN, MISS BARNES."
00:37:49.559,00:37:51.644,IT'S THE LAST ONE TONIGHT.
00:37:54.064,00:38:05.533,"ZOE BARNES WITH THE WASHINGTON HERALD NOW REPORTING, QUOTING A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT, AS SAYING THAT SENATOR CATHERINE DURANT WILL LIKELY BE THE NEW NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE AFTER MICHAEL KERN'S WITHDRAWAL EARLIER THIS WEEK."
00:38:05.617,00:38:13.708,"THE WHITE HOUSE HAS REMAINED SILENT ON WHETHER THE PRESIDENT WILL TAP DURANT FOR THE NOMINATION, BUT A NATIONAL ZOGBY POLL SHOWS WIDE SUPPORT FOR DURANT ACROSS PARTY LINES."
00:38:13.792,00:38:19.131,"CATHERINE DURANT HAS SERVED TEN YEARS ON THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, MADE NUMEROUS DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS TO SOUTH AMERICA..."
00:38:19.214,00:38:25.053,"WE CAN PLACE OUR FAITH IN HER, KNOWING THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBLE, EXPERIENCED, BRILLIANT WOMAN REPRESENTING OUR INTERESTS ABROAD."
00:38:25.137,00:38:28.514,"MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, TEAM PLAYER, STRONG ON DEFENSE."
00:38:28.598,00:38:31.143,"IF THERE'S A WOMAN THAT CAN WORK WITH THE JOINT CHIEFS, SHE'S THE ONE."
00:38:31.226,00:38:33.478,DURANT IS THE WAY TO GO. IT'S A NO-BRAINER.
00:38:33.561,00:38:36.064,THE PRESIDENT SHOULD STOP THIS PAGEANT AND SIMPLY MAKE THE CALL.
00:38:36.148,00:38:38.691,"WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT, IF THEY'RE GOING TO NOMINATE DURANT?"
00:38:38.775,00:38:47.909,WHY DON'T THEY JUST DO IT ALREADY SO WE CAN ALL STOP TALKING ABOUT IFS AND START TALKING ABOUT WHEN AND WHAT AND HOW DURANT'S GOING TO SHAPE UP FOREIGN POLICY...
00:39:14.311,00:39:16.313,"SO, HISTORY?"
00:39:18.315,00:39:19.899,HISTORY.
00:39:23.278,00:39:26.781,"I'M VERY IMPRESSED, FRANK."
00:39:26.865,00:39:28.491,"GOOD. WITH YOUR GO-AHEAD, I'LL START THE MOCK-UP."
00:39:28.574,00:39:30.368,HAVE BIRCH AND RASMUSSEN SEEN THIS?
00:39:30.451,00:39:32.453,NOT YET. I WANTED YOU TO BE THE FIRST TO HAVE A LOOK.
00:39:32.537,00:39:34.497,I'LL SCHEDULE A TIME FOR YOU TO FILL IN THE PRESIDENT.
00:39:34.580,00:39:37.625,"OH, NO, NO, NO. THAT IS YOUR TURF, LINDA. YOU SHOULD DO THAT."
00:39:37.709,00:39:40.795,"- THANK YOU, FRANK. - MY PLEASURE. THANK YOU."
00:39:40.879,00:39:46.592,"- I SO APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYTHING-- - NO, NO, NO, N-- IT'S NOT NECESSARY."
00:39:46.676,00:39:48.761,NOW FOR THE REAL MEETING.
00:39:48.845,00:39:52.098,SO WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH MICHAEL KERN?
00:39:52.182,00:39:54.267,"OH, IT'S A TOTAL NIGHTMARE."
00:39:54.351,00:39:56.519,YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE GONNA TAP NEXT?
00:39:56.602,00:40:01.024,"FRANK, WE STILL NEED YOU IN THE HOUSE-- NO, NO, NO. I WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT."
00:40:01.107,00:40:03.442,WE'VE GOT OUR EDUCATION BILL. I WAS JUST CURIOUS.
00:40:03.526,00:40:07.322,SOMEHOW THE RUMOR IS FLYING AROUND THAT WE'RE GONNA NOMINATE CATHERINE DURANT.
00:40:07.405,00:40:09.991,- I'M SURE YOU'VE NOTICED. - IS THE RUMOR TRUE?
00:40:10.075,00:40:15.830,"WELL, WE WEREN'T CONSIDERING HER AT FIRST, BUT THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME TO HAVE HER VETTED IN CASE WE WANNA GO THAT ROUTE."
00:40:15.914,00:40:18.375,- INTERESTING. - WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:40:22.087,00:40:25.464,"WELL, SHE WOULDN'T BE MY FIRST CHOICE-- WHO WOULD BE YOUR FIRST CHOICE?"
00:40:25.548,00:40:27.884,SHE CAMPAIGNED HARD AGAINST US IN THE PRIMARIES.
00:40:27.967,00:40:33.639,"- THAT'S MY RESERVATION. - BUT YOU'D BE ABOVE PARTY POLITICS, AND I KNOW SHE'D WORK ALL THE HARDER FOR IT."
00:40:33.723,00:40:36.226,"DECENT EXPERIENCE, RESPECT ACROSS THE AISLE."
00:40:36.309,00:40:38.144,SO YOU THINK WE CAN SERIOUSLY CONSIDER HER?
00:40:40.272,00:40:42.732,IT'S NOT THE WORST IDEA IN THE WORLD.
00:41:02.668,00:41:05.671,- WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THIS SHIT? - WHAT?
00:41:05.755,00:41:12.053,"- YOUR STORIES. WHO ARE YOU FUCKING? - I WAS JUST-- - NOBODY. - OH, COME ON."
00:41:12.137,00:41:15.265,"YOU'RE A METRO SCRUB, AND NOW LOOK AT YOU."
00:41:15.348,00:41:17.183,YOU'D HAVE TO BE FUCKING SOMEBODY IMPORTANT.
00:41:17.267,00:41:20.061,"I'M JUST DOING MY JOB, JANINE."
00:41:20.145,00:41:21.813,EXCUSE ME.
00:41:31.990,00:41:34.326,"- IS THIS YOUR FIRST REMOTE? - YEAH, IT'S MY FIRST TIME."
00:41:44.836,00:41:50.133,"RIGHT INTO THE CAMERA, DON'T SHIFT IN YOUR SEAT, AND THERE'S NO REASON TO SPEAK ABOVE A CONVERSATIONAL VOLUME."
00:41:50.216,00:41:52.344,- THE MIC WILL PICK YOU UP. YOU ALL READY? - YEAH.
00:41:58.183,00:42:00.643,"FIVE, FOUR..."
00:42:08.818,00:42:10.945,"ZOE, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US."
00:42:11.029,00:42:13.823,I'M VERY GLAD TO BE HERE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
00:42:13.906,00:42:17.243,"YOU BROKE THE EDUCATION BILL, THE KERN EDITORIAL, AND NOW DURANT."
00:42:19.912,00:42:21.789,AND IT'S TRULY BEEN A TEAM EFFORT.
00:42:21.873,00:42:23.624,EVERYONE AT THE HERALD PITCHED IN.
00:42:23.708,00:42:27.753,"BUT, YES, A LOT OF FIRSTS."
00:42:27.837,00:42:30.006,"FIRST NATIONAL STORY, FIRST..."
00:42:39.098,00:42:40.766,THANK YOU.
00:42:42.685,00:42:44.521,CALLING IT A NIGHT.
00:42:45.897,00:42:48.274,"SEE YOU TOMORROW, SIR."
00:42:57.033,00:43:04.541,"FIRST NATIONAL STORY, FIRST FRONT-PAGE BYLINE, FIRST TV INTERVIEW."
00:43:04.623,00:43:09.003,"I WOULD WAVE TO MY MOM, BUT THE CAMERAMAN SAID NOT TO SHIFT IN MY SEAT."
00:43:12.257,00:43:15.260,WHAT A ROLLER COASTER.
00:43:15.343,00:43:19.180,IT REALLY IS TOO BAD. KERN WAS A GOOD MAN.
00:43:19.264,00:43:21.433,- AND NOW CATHERINE DURANT. - YES.
00:43:21.516,00:43:23.851,"RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT TIME, I SUPPOSE."
00:43:23.935,00:43:26.812,"- WE LIKE HER, DON'T WE? - VERY MUCH."
00:43:26.896,00:43:29.815,"QUESTION IS, DOES SHE LIKE SANCORP AS MUCH AS WE LIKE HER?"
00:43:29.899,00:43:32.527,I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS A VERY GOOD BET.
00:43:32.610,00:43:34.529,"BUT THEN AGAIN, I'M NOT A BETTING MAN."
00:43:34.612,00:43:37.156,- NO. YOU ALWAYS LIKE A SURE THING. - WHEN IT AVAILS ITSELF.
00:43:37.240,00:43:39.200,"- GOOD NIGHT, REMY. - GOOD NIGHT, FRANK."
00:43:39.284,00:43:42.412,- SEE YOU AROUND. - HOPEFULLY LESS AND LESS NOW.
00:43:48.251,00:43:50.169,"OH, NO. I CHARGED THE WRONG THING."
00:43:50.253,00:43:53.005,- WHAT DID YOU HAVE AGAIN? - A MEDIUM DECAF LATTE.
00:44:01.222,00:44:03.308,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET IT TO GO BACK.
00:44:21.367,00:44:23.536,"I HAVE TO ASK YOU TO STAY BACK, CONGRESSMAN."
00:44:23.620,00:44:26.038,- WHAT'S GOING ON? - SOME GUY TRYING TO GET IN THE BUILDING.
00:44:26.122,00:44:29.250,"WHEN WE SAID NO, HE STARTED TEARING HIS CLOTHES OFF."
00:44:51.648,00:44:54.984,NOBODY CAN HEAR YOU. NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOU.
00:44:55.067,00:44:56.902,NOTHING WILL COME OF THIS.
00:45:00.697,00:45:03.784,WHY DON'T YOU LET THESE NICE GENTLEMEN TAKE YOU HOME?
00:45:11.668,00:45:14.212,COVER HIM UP. IT'S COLD OUT HERE.
00:45:16.422,00:45:18.257,COVER HIM UP.
00:45:39.862,00:45:42.448,FRANCIS?
00:00:08.258,00:00:11.678,"PAGE 43, SECTION 7. WE'D LIKE SOME CLARIFICATION."
00:00:11.761,00:00:15.140,SECTION 7 HAS TO DO WITH THE EVALUATIVE MEASURES-- EVALUATIVE MEASURES.
00:00:15.223,00:00:17.892,"WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, PLAIN AND SIMPLE."
00:00:17.976,00:00:20.103,"WE CAN'T HAVE THAT. WE OPEN THAT CAN OF WORMS-- GOTTA TAKE IT OUT, FRANK."
00:00:20.186,00:00:21.438,THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS IT IN.
00:00:21.521,00:00:23.148,THEN WE'RE ALL WASTING OUR TIME.
00:00:23.231,00:00:27.819,"WELL, LOOK, I CAN CUT DOWN THE FREQUENCY OF TESTING, BUT IT'S GOT TO BE PART OF THE OVERALL-- THAT'S THE THIN EDGE OF A TWO-TON WEDGE."
00:00:27.902,00:00:29.320,"- NO WAY, NON-DEBATABLE. - ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON."
00:00:29.404,00:00:30.405,"THERE'S NO HARM IN HEARING THEM OUT, RIGHT?"
00:00:30.488,00:00:32.073,"FRANK, WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?"
00:00:32.157,00:00:34.325,WE ADJUST ARTICLE 4. HAND ME ARTICLE 4.
00:00:34.409,00:00:36.703,WE GO EVERY THREE YEARS INSTEAD OF TWO.
00:00:41.416,00:00:45.295,IF-- I'M JUST SAYING IF-- THE FREQUENCY COULD NEVER BE MORE THAN FIVE YEARS.
00:00:45.378,00:00:54.220,"LOOK, FIVE IS A LITTLE HIGH, BUT IF YOU CAN BEND ON THAT-- VETERAN TEACHERS WOULD HAVE TO BE EXEMPT IF THEY HAVE A PROVEN RECORD OF EXCELLENCE WITH THE STUDENTS."
00:00:54.304,00:00:55.597,"WELL, EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT."
00:00:55.680,00:00:57.057,"COREY, WILL YOU TAKE THE REINS ON THIS?"
00:00:57.140,00:01:02.228,"RIGHT, SO, ARTICLE 4-- IN TERMS OF EXCEPTIONS-- I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS THAT WE SHOULD TEAR IT DOWN."
00:01:02.312,00:01:09.652,"IT'S VULGAR, IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE COUNTY, BUT TIME AND TIME AGAIN FRANK UNDERWOOD HAS FOUGHT TO KEEP IT STANDING."
00:01:09.736,00:01:13.073,"IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM, THE PEACHOID WOULD'VE BEEN REPLACED AGES AGO."
00:01:13.156,00:01:16.659,AND JESSICA MASTERS WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.
00:01:16.743,00:01:19.329,THE CONGRESSMAN NEEDS TO ANSWER FOR THIS TRAGEDY.
00:01:19.412,00:01:20.830,WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?
00:01:20.914,00:01:28.588,"A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL RAN OFF THE ROAD TEXTING HER BOYFRIEND, AND I QUOTE, DOESN'T THE PEACHOID LOOK LIKE A GIANT..."
00:01:28.671,00:01:30.882,- AND THEN SHE LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR. - JESUS.
00:01:35.428,00:01:38.348,SUE GAFFNEY? IT'S IN HIS OWN JURISDICTION.
00:01:38.431,00:01:41.142,IT'S WORTH THROWING GAFFNEY UNDER THE BUS TO DRAG YOU INTO THE MESS.
00:01:41.226,00:01:42.811,HE'S AFTER MY SEAT AGAIN.
00:01:42.894,00:01:44.854,HAS HE LEARNED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING?
00:01:44.938,00:01:47.607,"IT'S A FULL-ON SMEAR CAMPAIGN, BOSS."
00:01:47.690,00:01:49.234,HE'S OUT TO DESTROY YOU.
00:01:49.317,00:01:50.985,"WITH THIS? IT'S A PEACH, FOR CHRIST SAKE."
00:01:51.069,00:01:52.779,LET HIM MAKE A FOOL OUT OF HIMSELF.
00:01:55.365,00:01:59.661,"IF HE SPINS THIS RIGHT, GETS NATIONAL COVERAGE-- NATIONAL COVERAGE? IT'S A JOKE."
00:01:59.744,00:02:00.829,AND YOU WILL BE THE BUTT OF IT.
00:02:00.912,00:02:06.584,"WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT RIGHT NOW, NOT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SPOTLIGHT WITH THE EDUCATION BILL."
00:02:06.668,00:02:09.212,THIS THING HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH DAMN TROUBLE.
00:02:09.295,00:02:12.173,"- I KNOW. - SO WHO SHOULD I CALL, PARENTS?"
00:02:12.257,00:02:13.925,PHONE CALL'S NOT GOING TO CUT IT.
00:02:14.008,00:02:15.760,- YOU NEED TO GO DOWN THERE. - CAN IT WAIT UNTIL MONDAY?
00:02:15.844,00:02:18.054,"WE GET ON THIS THING RIGHT NOW, WE CAN CONTAIN IT."
00:02:18.179,00:02:21.558,"WE WAIT UNTIL MONDAY, THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW HOW MUCH THIS IS GONNA BLOW UP ON US."
00:02:21.641,00:02:24.727,I CAN'T GO DOWN TO GAFFNEY. THE UNIONS HAVE JUST-- - WE POSTPONE-- - THEY'RE GONNA BE LIVID.
00:02:24.853,00:02:27.147,"MARTY'S REASONABLE, OKAY? HE WILL EXPLAIN TO THEM."
00:02:27.230,00:02:35.238,"AND THEY'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT I HAD TO GET UP FROM THE NEGOTIATING TABLE BECAUSE SOME TWO-BIT COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR WANTS TO-- I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT YOU, SIR, BUT THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT ORRIN."
00:02:35.321,00:02:36.865,IT'S ABOUT THE PARENTS.
00:02:39.409,00:02:40.493,"NOW, YOU THINK ABOUT THE LAWSUIT."
00:02:42.412,00:02:44.581,WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE TO TESTIFY?
00:02:44.664,00:02:46.457,"SUBPOENAS, DEPOSITIONS."
00:02:46.541,00:02:50.670,"YOU GET DRAGGED INTO A COURT BATTLE, THERE IS NO EDUCATION BILL."
00:02:52.171,00:02:53.506,WE CAN'T IGNORE THIS.
00:02:56.134,00:02:58.261,I JUST HATE THIS SMALL-BALL CRAP.
00:04:33.731,00:04:36.109,IT'S CALLED THE WHAT? THE PEACH WHAT?
00:04:37.277,00:04:40.363,IT'S A GIANT WATER TOWER IN THE SHAPE OF A PEACH.
00:04:43.366,00:04:45.743,I JUST GOOGLED IT. THE PEACHOID.
00:04:45.827,00:04:47.745,"SHE WAS 17, LINDA."
00:04:47.829,00:04:49.622,YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.
00:04:49.706,00:04:51.749,"- I NEED ANOTHER WEEK. - NO, THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK."
00:04:51.833,00:04:52.834,THE PRESIDENT MAKES HIS SPEECH ON TUESDAY.
00:04:52.917,00:04:53.918,WE'VE ALREADY ANNOUNCED.
00:04:54.002,00:04:55.753,SPEECHES CAN BE RESCHEDULED.
00:04:55.837,00:04:57.755,"WE HAVE TO SHOW SOME PROGRESS ON EDUCATION, FRANK."
00:04:57.839,00:04:59.507,THE FIRST HUNDRED DAYS IS ALMOST OVER.
00:04:59.590,00:05:02.635,"IF WE PUSH BACK THE SPEECH, IT'LL LOOK LIKE WE'RE SPINNING OUR WHEELS."
00:05:02.719,00:05:03.761,"ALL RIGHT, I'LL WORK SOMETHING OUT."
00:05:03.845,00:05:05.096,"THANK YOU, LINDA."
00:05:09.100,00:05:12.979,"FRANK, THESE ARE THE HEADS OF THE TWO LARGEST TEACHERS UNIONS IN THE COUNTRY."
00:05:13.062,00:05:15.356,- I UNDERSTAND. - THEY FLEW HERE ON A WEEKEND.
00:05:15.440,00:05:19.360,"DOUG WILL LEAD THE CHARGE. CONGRESSMAN PHILLIPS IS WELL VETTED-- THEY FLEW HERE TO SEE YOU, FRANK."
00:05:19.444,00:05:20.445,YOU'RE MANAGING THIS BILL.
00:05:20.528,00:05:21.946,PUT THIS IN THE OTHER BAG.
00:05:22.030,00:05:23.531,AND I'LL BE IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION.
00:05:23.614,00:05:25.033,"ANYTHING BIG COMES UP, I'M A PHONE CALL AWAY."
00:05:25.116,00:05:26.743,IT'S A 300-PAGE DOCUMENT.
00:05:26.826,00:05:28.286,WE NEED YOU IN THAT ROOM.
00:05:28.369,00:05:31.164,"I WOULD STAY IF I COULD, BUT THIS IS MY HOME DISTRICT."
00:05:31.247,00:05:33.082,"NOW, MARTY, CUT ME A LITTLE SLACK HERE."
00:05:33.166,00:05:34.584,WE'LL GET IT DONE.
00:05:34.667,00:05:36.127,YOU AND I GO WAY BACK.
00:05:36.210,00:05:38.588,HAVE I EVER LET YOU DOWN?
00:05:38.671,00:05:39.964,"NO, YOU HAVEN'T."
00:05:40.048,00:05:42.425,AND I DON'T INTEND TO START NOW.
00:05:50.475,00:05:52.018,HELLO?
00:06:17.085,00:06:19.462,- GILLIAN? - CLAIRE.
00:06:19.545,00:06:21.297,IT'S SO NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.
00:06:21.380,00:06:22.590,YEAH-- I'M A LITTLE UNDER THE WEATHER.
00:06:22.673,00:06:24.092,I DON'T WANT TO GET YOU SICK.
00:06:24.175,00:06:26.886,"WELL, IF YOU'RE FEELING ILL, WE CAN-- NO, NO, NO, I'M FINE. IT'S JUST A COLD."
00:06:26.969,00:06:28.638,"WELL, THANK YOU FOR COMING IN."
00:06:28.721,00:06:29.722,OF COURSE.
00:06:29.806,00:06:30.973,SHALL WE TALK IN MY OFFICE?
00:06:33.518,00:06:34.685,"OH, THANK YOU."
00:06:34.769,00:06:36.479,ADAM GALLOWAY TOOK THE PICTURES.
00:06:36.562,00:06:37.563,HAVE YOU HEARD OF HIM?
00:06:37.647,00:06:39.232,NO.
00:06:39.315,00:06:42.485,I MET HIM AT THE WHITNEY BIENNIAL A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND COMMISSIONED HIM TO DO THESE.
00:06:42.568,00:06:45.780,HE JUST HAD A BIG SHOW AT PS1.
00:06:45.863,00:06:47.365,I'M NOT UP TO DATE ON THE ART WORLD.
00:06:47.448,00:06:49.158,THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
00:06:49.242,00:06:51.035,WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY. ARE WE?
00:06:51.119,00:06:52.870,MY OFFICE IS OVER HERE.
00:06:52.954,00:06:53.955,"YOU RUN INTO ANY TROUBLE, YOU CALL ME."
00:06:54.038,00:06:55.081,I GOT IT COVERED.
00:06:55.164,00:06:56.165,GENE CLANCY KNOW I'M COMING?
00:06:56.249,00:06:57.250,JUST SPOKE TO HIM.
00:06:57.333,00:06:58.626,GET TO IT.
00:06:58.709,00:07:00.086,"YOUR FLIGHT IS BOOKED, LEAVES IN 55 MINUTES."
00:07:00.169,00:07:01.379,ED WILL BE JOINING YOU.
00:07:01.462,00:07:02.755,WHERE'S STEVE?
00:07:02.839,00:07:04.757,"HE WENT HOME SICK ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, SIR."
00:07:04.841,00:07:06.175,I'LL BE FILLING IN.
00:07:06.259,00:07:07.635,WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN? EDWARD WHAT?
00:07:07.718,00:07:09.262,"- MEECHUM. - YOU DRIVE FAST, MEECHUM?"
00:07:21.441,00:07:23.025,YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME?
00:07:23.109,00:07:27.447,"COME ON, ZOE. THIS IS MRS. TILDEN, OWNER OF-- SHE KNOWS WHO I AM."
00:07:30.241,00:07:32.827,"NO, I DIDN'T. I LOVED IT."
00:07:32.910,00:07:35.329,"IN DEPTH, UNCOMPROMISING."
00:07:35.413,00:07:39.333,"NORMALLY I DON'T READ THINGS BEFORE THEY GO TO PRINT, BUT CATHY'S A FRIEND."
00:07:39.417,00:07:43.087,TELL ME HOW YOU KNEW SHE'D BE NOMINATED BEFORE SHE DID?
00:07:43.171,00:07:44.297,YOU WANT MY SOURCE?
00:07:44.380,00:07:46.048,TOM SAYS YOU WON'T TELL HIM.
00:07:47.341,00:07:48.676,"WELL, I OWN THE PAPER."
00:07:48.759,00:07:51.095,AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO BE WORKING HERE.
00:07:51.179,00:07:52.847,SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME EITHER.
00:07:52.930,00:07:55.016,"WHICH DO YOU WANT, MY SOURCE OR MY INTEGRITY?"
00:07:58.811,00:08:00.480,TOM.
00:08:02.648,00:08:06.444,MOVE ZOE'S PIECE TO THE FRONT PAGE OF SUNDAY'S EDITION.
00:08:06.527,00:08:07.820,LET ME THINK THAT OVER.
00:08:07.904,00:08:09.780,YOU THINK IT OVER AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.
00:08:09.864,00:08:11.115,THEN PUT IT ON THE FRONT PAGE.
00:08:21.584,00:08:24.295,I'VE WORKED REALLY HARD TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD WITH WORLD WELL.
00:08:24.378,00:08:27.131,SIX YEARS AGO IT WAS JUST ME AND A MACBOOK.
00:08:27.215,00:08:28.883,I UNDERSTAND.
00:08:28.966,00:08:30.968,AND I HAD TO JUGGLE TWO TEMP JOBS JUST TO PAY THE RENT.
00:08:31.052,00:08:33.262,IT'S YOUR BABY. YOU DON'T WANT TO LET IT GO.
00:08:35.598,00:08:39.435,"AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO, GILLIAN."
00:08:39.519,00:08:42.980,ALL I WANT IS FOR YOU TO GROW WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY BUILT.
00:08:43.064,00:08:44.357,I HEARD YOU FIRED HALF YOUR STAFF.
00:08:44.440,00:08:45.816,"YES, I DID."
00:08:48.027,00:08:52.156,I LET THEM GO TO MAKE ROOM FOR YOU.
00:08:52.240,00:08:54.659,I'M JUST NOT SURE WE'RE THE RIGHT MATCH.
00:08:54.742,00:09:02.917,"TO BE HONEST, I'M A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE WORKING WITH SOMEONE WHO'S COMMISSIONING FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPHERS WHEN I CAN'T EVEN BUY MY VOLUNTEERS BUS FAIR TO THE OFFICE."
00:09:03.000,00:09:04.961,DO YOU KNOW WHO NICKY HEMLER IS?
00:09:05.044,00:09:06.128,NO.
00:09:06.212,00:09:09.048,NICKY OWNS ONE OF THE BIGGEST GALLERIES IN CHELSEA.
00:09:09.131,00:09:12.426,SHE DESPERATELY WANTED TO REPRESENT ADAM GALLOWAY.
00:09:12.510,00:09:17.974,"I DELIVERED ON ADAM, AND IN RETURN SHE CONTRIBUTES ALMOST 40 GRAND A YEAR TO C.W.I."
00:09:18.057,00:09:22.853,"THAT MONEY GOES TO IMPACT STUDIES, LOBBYING EFFORTS, RESEARCH."
00:09:22.937,00:09:29.360,"WORLD WELL COULD BENEFIT FROM THAT SORT OF MONEY, GILLIAN, AND WE CAN BENEFIT FROM YOUR EXPERTISE."
00:09:35.700,00:09:37.577,OF COURSE.
00:09:37.660,00:09:39.412,WE DON'T HAVE TO JUMP INTO ANYTHING.
00:09:39.495,00:09:44.834,"I GREW UP HERE, IN THE UP COUNTRY-- BIBLES, BARBECUES, AND BROKEN BACKS."
00:09:44.917,00:09:51.215,"EVERYTHING GETS JUST A LITTLE BIT THICKER THIS FAR SOUTH-- THE AIR, THE BLOOD, EVEN ME."
00:09:51.299,00:09:53.509,I TRY TO MAKE IT DOWN HERE AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH.
00:09:53.593,00:09:56.387,EVERY TRIP IS A REMINDER OF HOW FAR I'VE COME.
00:09:56.470,00:10:02.435,"I HATED GAFFNEY AS A KID, WHEN I HAD NOTHING, BUT NOW I'VE COME TO APPRECIATE IT."
00:10:02.518,00:10:08.024,"IT'S NOT AS SUFFOCATING AS IT ONCE WAS, EXCEPT WHEN I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE SORT OF NONSENSE THAT MAKES ME WANT TO HANG MYSELF."
00:10:09.900,00:10:11.193,DON'T LISTEN TO HER. I KNOW A BETTER WAY.
00:10:11.277,00:10:12.570,"YES, SIR."
00:10:13.988,00:10:16.240,THE LEGAL BILLS ALONE WILL KILL US.
00:10:16.324,00:10:18.200,HOW ABOUT A SETTLEMENT?
00:10:18.284,00:10:20.536,I'LL LOOK AT THE NUMBERS.
00:10:20.620,00:10:22.204,WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE TO YOU?
00:10:22.288,00:10:23.706,LIKE A PEACH.
00:10:28.628,00:10:30.921,"AS MAYOR, I'LL STICK WITH A PEACH."
00:10:31.005,00:10:37.094,"AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THE SUN IS SHINING WHERE IT SHOULDN'T BE."
00:10:40.890,00:10:43.559,"REALLY, FRANK? AND WHAT'S THAT?"
00:10:43.643,00:10:45.686,I'M NOT TRYING TO START AN ARGUMENT HERE.
00:10:45.770,00:10:47.813,YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE I'M IN THE WRONG.
00:10:47.897,00:10:50.650,"NO, YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING, ORRIN."
00:10:50.733,00:10:53.402,YOU'RE USING THIS POOR GIRL'S DEATH FOR YOUR OWN POLITICAL ADVANTAGE.
00:10:53.486,00:10:57.239,YOU'RE THE ONE THAT FOUGHT ME WHEN THE PEACH FARMERS BITCHED AND MOANED ABOUT ME TEARING IT DOWN.
00:10:57.323,00:10:58.699,YOU'RE THE ONE THAT TOOK THEIR MONEY.
00:10:58.783,00:11:00.493,- IT'S A WATER TOWER. - IT'S UNGODLY.
00:11:00.576,00:11:01.952,"- ORRIN. - THIS IS CUT AND DRY, FRANK."
00:11:02.036,00:11:03.788,I FOUGHT TO TEAR IT DOWN.
00:11:03.871,00:11:05.414,YOU FOUGHT TO KEEP IT UP.
00:11:05.498,00:11:09.502,"THAT GIRL'S BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS, AND I'M TAKING YOU TO TASK FOR IT."
00:11:12.171,00:11:14.131,"ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT."
00:11:14.215,00:11:16.717,DICK PETERS IS GOING TO RETIRE THIS TERM.
00:11:16.801,00:11:19.804,THAT MEANS THERE'S AN OPEN RACE IN THE FOURTH DISTRICT.
00:11:19.887,00:11:21.597,HOW ABOUT I HELP YOU LOCK UP THAT SEAT?
00:11:21.680,00:11:23.849,"I'M NOT LOOKING TO MAKE A DEAL, FRANK."
00:11:23.933,00:11:25.601,IT'S NOT A DEAL.
00:11:25.684,00:11:26.977,IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY.
00:11:29.063,00:11:30.523,I'LL BE JUST FINE.
00:11:35.653,00:11:39.532,BUT THE CLASSY THING TO DO WOULD'VE BEEN TO INVITE US UP FOR SOME OF THAT ICED TEA.
00:12:19.155,00:12:20.322,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
00:12:22.533,00:12:23.826,YOU SHOULDN'T RUN HERE.
00:12:23.909,00:12:25.578,IT'S DISGRACEFUL.
00:12:25.661,00:12:27.580,HAVE YOU NO RESPECT?
00:12:49.768,00:12:51.812,THE CRITERIA IS A STARTING POINT.
00:12:51.896,00:12:53.230,"THEY'RE SUGGESTED, NOT MANDATED."
00:12:53.314,00:13:00.321,"WE ASSEMBLE A COUNCIL OF EXPERTS WHO WILL DETERMINE EXACTLY-- NOWHERE HERE DOES IT SAY WHO THESE EXPERTS ARE, HOW THEY'LL BE CHOSEN."
00:13:00.404,00:13:01.655,THE PRESIDENT SELECTS THE COUNCIL.
00:13:01.739,00:13:03.115,WHAT SORT OF OVERSIGHT?
00:13:03.199,00:13:04.408,WE'D LIKE INPUT ON THE SELECTION.
00:13:04.492,00:13:05.618,"DOUG, CHECK WITH LINDA."
00:13:05.701,00:13:07.369,CALLING HER NOW.
00:13:07.453,00:13:11.916,"OKAY, SO NOW CAN WE TALK ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS?"
00:13:11.999,00:13:13.209,CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE A NO-GO.
00:13:13.292,00:13:14.376,THEY HAVE TO BE IN THERE.
00:13:14.460,00:13:15.503,"YOU KEEP THEM IN, WE WALK."
00:13:15.586,00:13:16.754,THE SAME GOES FOR US.
00:13:16.837,00:13:18.672,LET'S NOT JUMP TO ULTIMATUMS.
00:13:18.756,00:13:21.467,"WELL, LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY TO REDUCE NON-PUBLIC SPENDING."
00:13:21.550,00:13:23.219,"ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES TO THINK ABOUT THAT."
00:13:23.302,00:13:25.930,WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT ADDRESSING THIS POINT.
00:13:26.013,00:13:29.058,- BUT THIS IS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE BILL. - LET'S TALK IT OUT.
00:13:29.141,00:13:31.310,"GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES, MARTY. I'LL CALL YOU RIGHT BACK."
00:13:34.688,00:13:35.898,WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR IT.
00:13:39.944,00:13:42.863,WE'RE ADMITTING THAT THE TOWN'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS KID'S DEATH.
00:13:42.947,00:13:45.115,I SAY MAKE THE PEACH FARMERS COUGH IT UP.
00:13:45.199,00:13:46.742,"OH, MAN, TALK ABOUT A SHIT STORM."
00:13:46.825,00:13:48.244,Y'ALL MIND CATCHIN' ME UP?
00:13:48.327,00:13:50.246,WAYNE AND TRAVIS WANT TO GO TO COURT.
00:13:50.329,00:13:51.830,I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
00:13:51.914,00:13:55.084,WE CAN'T BE POURING MONEY INTO A SETTLEMENT WHEN WE CAN BARELY AFFORD TO RUN THE CITY.
00:13:55.167,00:13:57.086,"WHAT DO YOU THINK, GENE?"
00:13:57.169,00:14:00.256,I THINK THAT WE GOTTA WORRY ABOUT THE PEACH FARMERS ASSOCIATION.
00:14:00.339,00:14:04.134,"IF THERE IS A HINT THAT WE'RE BLAMING THE PEACHOID, THEY'RE GOING TO RAISE HOLY HELL."
00:14:04.218,00:14:05.970,WHO GIVES A CRAP? THEY GOTTA SUCK IT UP.
00:14:06.053,00:14:07.263,LET HIM TALK.
00:14:09.390,00:14:12.768,I'M JUST SAYING THAT WE NEED TO KEEP THEM IN MIND.
00:14:12.851,00:14:14.520,SHE WAS BREAKING THE LAW. END OF STORY.
00:14:14.603,00:14:15.938,YOU CAN'T TEXT WHILE YOU DRIVE.
00:14:16.021,00:14:20.025,"YEAH, BUT ALL A JURY'S GOING TO SEE IS A BEAUTIFUL 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO'S NOW DEAD."
00:14:20.109,00:14:21.902,"NO OFFENSE, FRANK, BUT YOU JUST GOT HERE."
00:14:21.986,00:14:23.696,WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS FOR THE LAST WEEK NOW.
00:14:23.779,00:14:25.197,AND WHERE'S YOUR SOLUTION?
00:14:25.281,00:14:26.657,WHAT?
00:14:26.740,00:14:28.033,YOU THINK YOU KNOW BETTER THAN US?
00:14:28.117,00:14:29.869,I'M JUST TRYING TO BE REALISTIC.
00:14:29.952,00:14:34.790,"FRANK, I KNOW YOU WANT TO SWOOP DOWN AND SAVE THE DAY, BUT THERE'S A PRINCIPLE AT STAKE HERE."
00:14:34.874,00:14:53.058,"WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE EXTORTED BECAUSE OF THIS TEENAGER-- WHEN ORRIN GETS A JURY TO WEEP A RIVER OF SNOT OVER THIS DEAD GIRL, WHEN GAFFNEY GOES TITS UP BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY A SEVEN-FIGURE AWARD IN DAMAGES, WHEN YOU ALL GET BOOTED OUT OF OFFICE AND I LOSE TO CHASE, THEN YOU CAN CHEW MY EAR OFF ABOUT PRINCIPLES, BECAUSE WE'LL ALL HAVE NOTHING BUT TIME ON OUR HANDS."
00:14:53.142,00:14:57.062,"UNTIL THEN, YOU EITHER CONTRIBUTE, OR YOU KEEP IT SHUT, TRAVIS."
00:14:57.146,00:14:58.355,"NOW, HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO."
00:14:58.439,00:15:01.567,"GENE, HOW MUCH CAN WE PULL TOGETHER - FOR A SETTLEMENT IF WE HAD TO? - ABOUT 150."
00:15:01.650,00:15:03.152,THAT'LL WORK.
00:15:03.235,00:15:05.863,"JAMIE, GET YOUR BOYS DOWN TO THE HARDWARE STORE TO BUILD TWO BILLBOARDS."
00:15:05.946,00:15:07.698,PUT THEM OUT A MILE OUT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TOWER.
00:15:07.781,00:15:10.367,"HAVE THEM READ, DRIVE SAFELY. NO TEXTING BEHIND THE WHEEL."
00:15:10.451,00:15:12.202,- GOT IT. - GET THOSE UP BY TOMORROW MORNING.
00:15:12.286,00:15:13.370,I'LL ISSUE THE PERMITS.
00:15:13.454,00:15:15.831,AND LET'S STOP LIGHTING THE THING AT NIGHT.
00:15:15.915,00:15:17.291,THE PEACH FARMERS AREN'T GOING TO LIKE THAT.
00:15:17.374,00:15:18.834,"WELL, HOW MUCH DOES THE ELECTRIC COST?"
00:15:18.918,00:15:21.378,"4,100 PLUS CHANGE PER MONTH."
00:15:21.462,00:15:23.130,"ABOUT 50,000 A YEAR."
00:15:23.213,00:15:29.720,"JESUS, YOU COULD PUT A KID THROUGH COLLEGE ON-- LET'S USE THAT MONEY TO START A SCHOLARSHIP FUND IN HER NAME."
00:15:29.803,00:15:33.390,"MEANTIME, YOU TELL THE ASSOCIATION, IF THEY WANT IT LIT UP, THEY CAN PAY FOR IT."
00:15:33.474,00:15:34.975,I'LL DELIVER THAT MESSAGE HAPPILY.
00:15:35.059,00:15:37.853,AND DO ME UP A BUDGET AND A PLAN FOR REMOVING THE SPHINCTER.
00:15:37.937,00:15:38.938,THE WHAT?
00:15:39.021,00:15:40.898,HE MEANS THE EMERGENCY VALVE.
00:15:40.981,00:15:42.274,THAT'S INTERESTING.
00:15:42.358,00:15:44.276,I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF IT AS A CLITORIS.
00:15:44.360,00:15:46.028,BUT IT'S ON BOTTOM.
00:15:46.111,00:15:53.661,I BELIEVE THE CLITORIS IS ABOVE THE-- BUT IF YOU IMAGINE A WOMAN ON HER BELLY-- ENOUGH. I WANT IT DONE.
00:15:53.744,00:15:57.539,"AND, GENE, GET ME EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT ON ROAD REGULATIONS."
00:15:57.623,00:15:59.792,"COUNTY STATUTES, NOT MUNICIPAL."
00:15:59.875,00:16:03.170,AND DO YOU REMEMBER THAT POWER LINE BUSINESS WE PULLED UP AT THE LAST ELECTION?
00:16:03.295,00:16:04.380,SURE DO.
00:16:04.463,00:16:06.423,LET'S MAKE SURE WE'RE ROCK SOLID ON THAT.
00:16:07.675,00:16:13.430,DOES THIS VERY EXPENSIVE DINNER AT LEAST BUY ME AN EVENING OF MIND-BLOWING SEXUAL CONGRESS?
00:16:13.514,00:16:16.058,"IT WAS GOOD, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THAT GOOD."
00:16:16.141,00:16:17.226,FELLATIO GOOD?
00:16:17.309,00:16:20.896,HAND JOB MAYBE. NO PROMISES.
00:16:20.980,00:16:23.065,DEAL.
00:16:23.148,00:16:26.610,"HEY, UM, PETER, THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU."
00:16:26.694,00:16:29.989,I HAVE BEEN THINKING LATELY.
00:16:30.072,00:16:33.492,"YOU KNOW, UM, IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE."
00:16:33.575,00:16:38.163,"SO I DID SOME INTERVIEWS, AND THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE OFFERED ME DEPUTY L.D."
00:16:42.584,00:16:44.503,PETER.
00:16:44.586,00:16:51.885,"CHRISTINA, UM-- I JUST THOUGHT IT COULD BE GOOD, RIGHT, IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY FUTURE, TO STOP THIS BOSS-STAFFER THING AND BE A REAL COUPLE."
00:16:51.969,00:16:53.220,WE ARE A REAL COUPLE.
00:16:53.303,00:16:56.724,I MEAN NOT HAVE TO HIDE IT LIKE WE DO AT THE OFFICE.
00:16:56.807,00:16:58.642,AND IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
00:16:58.726,00:17:00.185,THE SPEAKER?
00:17:01.270,00:17:04.064,WOULD YOU HATE ME IF I TOOK THE JOB?
00:17:07.776,00:17:12.239,"BABY, I WANT WHAT YOU WANT."
00:17:12.322,00:17:17.327,"I'M NOT-- I WON'T FIGHT YOU ON THIS, NOT IF THIS IS WHAT YOU FEEL YOU NEED TO DO."
00:17:17.411,00:17:18.662,- REALLY? - YEAH.
00:17:18.746,00:17:20.289,AND YOU'RE RIGHT.
00:17:20.372,00:17:21.373,THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
00:17:21.457,00:17:23.500,WHEN DO YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM BY?
00:17:23.584,00:17:25.627,THERE'S NO DEADLINE. I DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE RIGHT AWAY.
00:17:25.711,00:17:30.215,"OKAY, WELL, WHEN YOU DECIDE, JUST, YOU KNOW, HELP ME FIND A REPLACEMENT."
00:17:30.299,00:17:31.633,"YOU KNOW, GIVE ME A HEADS-UP."
00:17:31.717,00:17:33.302,"YEAH, OF COURSE."
00:17:33.385,00:17:36.221,I HAVEN'T EVEN DECIDED IF I'M GOING TO TAKE IT.
00:17:36.305,00:17:37.765,WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK THIS THROUGH RIGHT NOW.
00:17:37.848,00:17:39.266,I JUST-- I JUST THOUGHT I'D BRING IT UP.
00:17:45.689,00:17:46.774,SHOULD WE GET OUT OF HERE?
00:17:46.857,00:17:47.900,YES.
00:18:00.120,00:18:02.706,LET'S GO FIND THE PARENTS.
00:18:02.790,00:18:04.208,YOU HANG BACK BY THE CAR.
00:18:04.291,00:18:06.043,"IT'S A BIG CROWD, SIR."
00:18:07.336,00:18:14.009,"IF I GET SHOT OR STABBED CONSOLING TWO GRIEVING PARENTS, I'M A HERO FROM NOW UNTIL THE END OF TIME."
00:18:14.093,00:18:15.844,LET'S ROLL THE DICE. SHALL WE?
00:18:15.928,00:18:18.388,"SIR, I CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO GO UNESCORTED INTO ALL THOSE PEOPLE."
00:18:22.392,00:18:23.811,ALLOW ME?
00:18:23.894,00:18:25.562,"LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT, MEECHUM."
00:18:25.646,00:18:28.899,YOU ARE NEVER TO DICTATE WHAT I CAN AND CANNOT DO.
00:18:28.982,00:18:33.821,THE ONLY TWO WORDS I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU WHEN I ASK YOU TO DO SOMETHING ARE YES AND SIR.
00:18:33.904,00:18:35.447,IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?
00:18:35.531,00:18:37.157,"YES, SIR."
00:18:37.241,00:18:39.535,GOOD. THEN WE'RE GONNA GET ALONG JUST FINE.
00:18:50.671,00:18:55.217,"MR. AND MRS. MASTERS, I'M FRANK UNDERWOOD, YOUR CONGRESSMAN."
00:18:55.300,00:18:58.428,I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
00:18:58.512,00:19:02.683,I CANNOT BEGIN TO FATHOM-- YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU CAN'T. YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
00:19:02.766,00:19:07.354,"FORGIVE ME. I DON'T MEAN TO INTRUDE. I JUST-- - WELL, YOU ARE INTRUDING. - DEAN, PLEASE."
00:19:07.437,00:19:08.564,WHAT?
00:19:08.647,00:19:10.983,"IT'S HIS FAULT, ISN'T IT?"
00:19:11.108,00:19:17.614,"ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY CONDOLENCES, AND SAY IF THERE'S ANYTHING THE TWO OF YOU NEED-- DEAN, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TALKING TO HIM."
00:19:17.739,00:19:19.158,WE GOT LEGAL ACTION PENDING.
00:19:19.241,00:19:22.953,"LOOK, I KNOW WHAT MR. CHASE HAS BEEN SAYING, AND BELIEVE-- NOBODY INVITED YOU."
00:19:23.036,00:19:25.414,NOBODY WANTS YOUR CONDOLENCES OR YOUR EXCUSES.
00:19:25.497,00:19:27.291,"FRANK, PLEASE."
00:19:30.878,00:19:33.297,YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.
00:19:33.422,00:19:34.464,I'M SORRY.
00:19:39.720,00:19:40.762,"WELL, THAT WENT WELL."
00:19:44.474,00:19:47.269,HANG ON A SECOND. REVEREND.
00:19:48.061,00:19:49.229,CONGRESSMAN.
00:19:49.313,00:19:51.023,NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
00:19:51.106,00:19:53.275,I WISH IT WAS UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES.
00:19:53.358,00:19:54.359,"TERRIBLE, ISN'T IT?"
00:19:54.443,00:19:55.986,IT'S JUST TERRIBLE.
00:19:56.069,00:19:57.738,THIS IS SO THOUGHTFUL WHAT YOU'VE ORGANIZED HERE.
00:19:57.821,00:19:59.323,LEAST WE CAN DO.
00:19:59.406,00:20:02.034,"TELL ME, ARE THE MASTERS IN YOUR CONGREGATION?"
00:20:02.117,00:20:04.536,THEY ARE. THEY COME EVERY SUNDAY.
00:20:04.620,00:20:06.997,DO YOU THINK THEY'LL BE AT THE SERVICE TOMORROW?
00:20:07.080,00:20:08.624,I'D BE SURPRISED IF THEY WEREN'T.
00:20:08.707,00:20:11.376,I'M WONDERING. CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
00:20:11.460,00:20:13.754,"ANYTHING FOR YOU, FRANK."
00:20:42.616,00:20:44.785,"OH, THE BLUE TOOTHBRUSH IS YOURS, RIGHT?"
00:20:50.165,00:20:52.209,"- HEY, PETER? - YEAH?"
00:20:52.292,00:20:53.794,WHERE DO YOU KEEP THE LIGHT BULBS?
00:20:53.877,00:20:55.128,THE LAMP IN THE BEDROOM IS OUT.
00:20:55.212,00:20:57.506,"IN THE KITCHEN, UNDER THE SINK."
00:21:41.550,00:21:48.932,"I WISH I COULD BE BIGGER THAN THIS, BUT I CAN'T, AND I'M BEING SELFISH, AND I REALIZE IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT ME, BUT FUCK IT."
00:21:49.016,00:21:52.477,"I HAVE TO SAY IT. PLEASE DON'T TAKE THAT OTHER JOB, CHRISTINA."
00:21:59.568,00:22:01.028,"ANYWAY, THAT'S HOW I FEEL."
00:22:02.738,00:22:03.989,I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME.
00:22:09.745,00:22:22.841,"CHARTERS JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO ORGANIZE, WHICH IS REASON ENOUGH, BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE IS THAT MEASURING THEIR SUCCESS-- CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE OPERATED UNDER THE SAME EVALUATIVE STANDARDS THAT EVERY-- APPLES AND ORANGES."
00:22:22.924,00:22:26.178,"NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT, YOU CAN'T USE THE SAME STANDARDS TO COMPARE."
00:22:26.261,00:22:30.849,"WHAT, YOU'RE ADVOCATING A MORE DEMANDING CRITERIA FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS - THAN OTHER SCHOOLS-- - OUR POINT IS SIMPLE, FRANK."
00:22:33.060,00:22:36.271,- TO PUBLIC UNION SCHOOL DISTRICTS - HOLD ON A SECOND.
00:22:36.354,00:22:38.940,"YEAH, BUT WE'VE ALREADY INCREASED NON-CHARTER FUNDING BY 10%."
00:22:39.024,00:22:41.318,THE AMOUNT GOING TO CHARTER SCHOOLS IS NEGLIGIBLE.
00:22:41.401,00:22:43.904,"IT'S THE PRECEDENT, FRANK, NOT THE NUMBER."
00:22:43.987,00:22:45.530,"WE'RE SETTING A LOT OF PRECEDENTS, MARTY."
00:22:45.614,00:22:47.491,THAT'S THE NATURE OF REFORM.
00:22:47.574,00:22:50.786,"WELL, SOME OF THEM WE CAN STOMACH. SOME OF THEM WE CAN'T."
00:22:50.869,00:22:52.454,"ALL RIGHT, LET'S NOT GET BOGGED DOWN IN ABSTRACTIONS."
00:22:52.537,00:22:53.830,LET'S DEAL WITH SPECIFICS.
00:22:53.914,00:22:56.374,"COREY, CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH IT?"
00:22:56.458,00:22:59.461,THERE'S A THREE-PRONG APPROACH TO DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING...
00:23:02.547,00:23:03.548,MISS ME?
00:23:03.632,00:23:05.092,MAYBE. A LITTLE.
00:23:05.175,00:23:06.885,"WHAT'S IT BEEN, 15 HOURS?"
00:23:08.553,00:23:11.181,NOT EVEN LONG ENOUGH TO NOTICE YOU'RE GONE.
00:23:11.264,00:23:12.849,TELL THAT TO MARTY SPINELLA.
00:23:12.933,00:23:14.351,HOW'S IT COMING?
00:23:14.434,00:23:17.687,"IT'S COMING. SLOWLY, PAINFULLY."
00:23:17.771,00:23:22.526,"HEY, HAVE WE ALWAYS HAD TULIPS IN THE FRONT YARD, OR AM I SLOWLY GOING INSANE?"
00:23:22.609,00:23:24.111,I PLANTED THEM LAST FALL.
00:23:24.194,00:23:25.612,YOU DID NOT.
00:23:25.695,00:23:28.323,WHEN I WAS DOWN WITH YOU FOR THE CAMPAIGN.
00:23:28.406,00:23:31.409,YOU'VE NEVER GARDENED A DAY IN YOUR LIFE.
00:23:31.493,00:23:34.955,NOT TRUE. I HAVE GARDENED EXACTLY ONE DAY IN MY LIFE.
00:23:35.038,00:23:38.333,YOU WERE DOWN IN SPARTANBURG DOING SOME SORT OF FUNDRAISER.
00:23:38.416,00:23:45.382,"GENE'S WIFE CAME OVER WITH A BUCKET OF BULBS, AND NEXT THING YOU KNEW, I WAS DOWN ON MY KNEES IN THE DIRT, EARTHWORMS AND ALL."
00:23:48.135,00:23:49.636,I CAN'T EVEN PICTURE IT.
00:23:49.719,00:23:51.471,"NEITHER CAN I, AND I WAS THERE."
00:23:51.555,00:23:53.265,WHAT ELSE?
00:23:53.348,00:23:55.433,DISTRACT ME FROM GIANT PEACHES AND DEAD TEENAGERS.
00:23:57.435,00:24:03.650,"OH, I WENT FOR A RUN TODAY, AND THE STRANGEST..."
00:24:07.779,00:24:08.905,I-- I DON'T KNOW.
00:24:08.989,00:24:10.365,THIS WOMAN...
00:24:14.578,00:24:15.620,THAT'S INTERESTING.
00:24:15.704,00:24:16.913,WHAT IS?
00:24:16.997,00:24:19.541,"OH, A TEXT JUST CAME. ZOE BARNES."
00:24:19.624,00:24:21.459,WHO?
00:24:21.543,00:24:25.172,"OH, THAT REPORTER FROM THE HERALD YOU MET ONE NIGHT."
00:24:25.255,00:24:26.590,"OH, HER. I REMEMBER."
00:24:26.673,00:24:28.133,"YEAH, GO IF YOU NEED TO CALL HER BACK."
00:24:28.216,00:24:29.634,"NO, SHE CAN WAIT."
00:24:29.718,00:24:31.428,I'M TALKING TO MY WIFE.
00:24:31.511,00:24:33.305,THAT'S OKAY. I'M GOING TO BED SOON ANYWAY.
00:24:33.388,00:24:34.556,SEE YOU TOMORROW?
00:24:34.639,00:24:35.849,I HOPE SO.
00:24:35.932,00:24:37.267,WISH ME LUCK.
00:24:40.979,00:24:43.940,"MM, BONSOIR, MY PETITE PEACHOID."
00:24:44.024,00:24:45.275,DISGUSTING.
00:24:45.358,00:24:47.485,- GOOD NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT.
00:24:47.569,00:24:49.779,"YEAH, ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FINE, COREY. MARTY?"
00:24:49.863,00:24:51.948,"FRANK, LET ME EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. HERE'S OUR PROBLEM."
00:26:05.897,00:26:07.649,"UH, YEAH, I'M HERE, MARTY."
00:26:07.732,00:26:12.279,"LOOK, WE CAN TALK OURSELVES IN CIRCLES ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS, BUT HERE'S WHAT I PROPOSE..."
00:26:12.362,00:26:17.701,"IN YOUR PROFILE, YOU GO INTO GREAT DETAIL ABOUT THE SEXISM DURANT FACED EARLY ON IN HER CAREER."
00:26:17.784,00:26:18.827,THAT'S RIGHT.
00:26:18.910,00:26:22.831,"WHEN SHE WAS FIRST ELECTED, IT WAS STILL AN OLD BOYS' CLUB IN THE SENATE."
00:26:22.914,00:26:25.959,"JOURNALISM USED TO BE THAT WAY, TOO, NOT SO LONG AGO."
00:26:27.752,00:26:31.131,I'VE HAD LOTS OF TRAILBLAZERS COME BEFORE ME.
00:26:31.214,00:26:38.221,"FOR INSTANCE, MY COLLEAGUE JANINE SKORSKY WAS THE FIRST WOMAN AT THE HERALD TO BECOME CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, AND THAT WAS ONLY FIVE YEARS AGO."
00:26:38.305,00:26:41.516,HAS IT BEEN THOSE TRAILBLAZERS WHO'VE ALLOWED YOU TO RISE SO QUICKLY?
00:26:41.599,00:26:45.729,YOU'VE MOVED UP FROM THE METRO PAGES TO THE FRONT PAGE SUNDAY EDITION.
00:26:49.316,00:26:51.985,IF JANINE HADN'T ALREADY PAVED THE WAY.
00:26:52.068,00:26:54.696,SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE HERALD IS NOT PARTICULARLY PROGRESSIVE?
00:26:54.779,00:26:57.198,I THINK THAT THEY ARE. TOM IS VERY OPEN-MINDED.
00:26:57.282,00:26:59.159,HE'S THE REASON JANINE GOT PROMOTED.
00:27:01.202,00:27:03.371,"YES, WE ACTUALLY CALL HIM THE HAMMER."
00:27:03.455,00:27:04.789,THE HAMMER? WHY?
00:27:04.873,00:27:05.957,BECAUSE HE'S TOUGH.
00:27:06.041,00:27:07.625,HOW TOUGH?
00:27:07.709,00:27:10.670,"HE'S, UH-- TOM HAS VERY HIGH STANDARDS."
00:27:10.754,00:27:12.005,I LOVE HIM.
00:27:12.088,00:27:14.007,HE'S A-- HE'S A GREAT MENTOR.
00:27:14.090,00:27:16.593,"UM, IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING AT TIMES."
00:27:16.676,00:27:29.022,"UM, HE MAKES YOU DOUBLE AND TRIPLE-CHECK THINGS, AND YOU WANT TO GET THE NEWS OUT THE MOMENT YOU HAVE IT, AND HE MAKES YOU REWRITE UNTIL IT'S PERFECT, BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE HERALD THE HERALD."
00:27:29.105,00:27:31.733,IS THAT A WORKABLE MODEL IN THE INTERNET AGE?
00:27:31.816,00:27:33.109,OUR READERS THINK IT IS.
00:27:33.193,00:27:34.736,"WELL, YOU HAVE A DECLINING READERSHIP."
00:27:34.819,00:27:36.571,BUT I DON'T LAY THAT AT TOM'S FEET.
00:27:36.654,00:27:39.324,"I THINK THAT THAT'S THE TIMES WE LIVE IN, RIGHT?"
00:27:42.452,00:27:45.121,IT'S NOT THAT THE HERALD REFUSES TO ADAPT.
00:27:45.205,00:27:47.040,WE HAVE AN ONLINE PRESENCE.
00:27:47.123,00:27:49.584,IS THAT MAYBE NOT ADAPTING FAST ENOUGH?
00:27:49.667,00:27:51.878,I WOULDN'T ARGUE WITH THAT STATEMENT.
00:27:51.961,00:27:54.464,WE COULD DO MORE.
00:28:29.582,00:28:32.460,WE'VE GOT A SPECIAL GUEST WITH US TODAY.
00:28:32.585,00:28:39.134,HE ASKED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A FEW WORDS WITH US THIS MORNING.
00:28:39.217,00:28:42.721,"OUR VERY OWN CONGRESSMAN, FRANK UNDERWOOD."
00:28:59.988,00:29:02.198,AND THANKS TO THAT CHOIR FOR THAT BEAUTIFUL HYMN.
00:29:02.282,00:29:06.286,"I WANT TO READ, THIS MORNING, FROM..."
00:29:18.631,00:29:20.049,NO.
00:29:21.801,00:29:25.221,YOU KNOW WHAT NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT?
00:29:25.305,00:29:26.639,HATE.
00:29:26.723,00:29:28.600,I KNOW ALL ABOUT HATE.
00:29:28.683,00:29:35.607,"IT STARTS IN YOUR GUT, DEEP DOWN HERE, WHERE IT STIRS AND CHURNS."
00:29:35.690,00:29:37.650,AND THEN IT RISES.
00:29:37.734,00:29:40.737,HATE RISES FAST AND VOLCANIC.
00:29:40.820,00:29:43.031,IT ERUPTS HOT ON THE BREATH.
00:29:43.114,00:29:45.325,YOUR EYES GO WIDE WITH FIRE.
00:29:45.408,00:29:49.829,YOU CLENCH YOUR TEETH SO HARD YOU THINK THEY'LL SHATTER.
00:29:57.796,00:30:00.465,"OH, DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T SAID THOSE WORDS BEFORE."
00:30:00.548,00:30:02.300,I KNOW YOU HAVE.
00:30:02.425,00:30:09.974,"WE ALL HAVE, IF YOU'VE EVER FELT SO CRUSHING A LOSS."
00:30:10.058,00:30:15.021,THERE ARE TWO PARENTS WITH US TODAY WHO KNOW THAT PAIN...
00:30:16.564,00:30:19.275,THE MOST TERRIBLE HURT OF ALL...
00:30:19.359,00:30:22.320,LOSING A CHILD BEFORE HER TIME.
00:30:22.403,00:30:28.034,"IF DEAN AND LEANNE WERE TO STAND UP RIGHT NOW AND SCREAM THOSE AWFUL WORDS OF HATE, COULD WE BLAME THEM?"
00:30:28.117,00:30:29.869,I COULDN'T.
00:30:29.953,00:30:32.539,AT LEAST THEIR HATRED I CAN UNDERSTAND.
00:30:32.622,00:31:02.777,"I CAN GRASP IT, BUT GOD'S WANTONNESS, HIS CRUELTY, I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO-- MY FATHER DROPPED DEAD OF A HEART ATTACK AT THE AGE OF 43. 43 YEARS OLD-- AND WHEN HE DIED, I LOOKED UP TO GOD AND I SAID THOSE WORDS, BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS SO YOUNG, SO FULL OF LIFE, SO FULL OF DREAMS."
00:31:02.861,00:31:06.698,WHY WOULD GOD TAKE HIM FROM US?
00:31:06.781,00:31:09.659,"TRUTH BE TOLD, I NEVER REALLY KNEW HIM OR WHAT HIS DREAMS WERE."
00:31:09.742,00:31:11.870,"HE WAS QUIET, TIMID, ALMOST INVISIBLE."
00:31:11.953,00:31:13.121,MY MOTHER DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF HIM.
00:31:13.204,00:31:14.622,MY MOTHER'S MOTHER HATED HIM.
00:31:14.706,00:31:17.041,THE MAN NEVER SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF LIFE.
00:31:17.125,00:31:18.543,MAYBE IT'S BEST HE DIED SO YOUNG.
00:31:18.626,00:31:20.712,HE WASN'T DOING MUCH BUT TAKING UP SPACE.
00:31:20.795,00:31:23.798,"BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE FOR A VERY POWERFUL EULOGY, NOW, DOES IT?"
00:31:23.882,00:31:27.302,"I WEPT. I SCREAMED, WHY, GOD?"
00:31:27.385,00:31:36.102,HOW CAN I NOT HATE YOU WHEN YOU STEAL FROM ME THE PERSON I MOST LOVE AND ADMIRE IN THIS WORLD?
00:31:38.688,00:31:41.399,"I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, AND I HATE YOU FOR IT."
00:31:46.487,00:31:58.249,"THE BIBLE SAYS IN PROVERBS, TRUST IN THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND LEAN NOT ON YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING."
00:31:58.333,00:32:01.920,LEAN NOT ON YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING.
00:32:02.003,00:32:07.383,"GOD IS TELLING US TO TRUST HIM, TO LOVE HIM DESPITE OUR OWN IGNORANCE."
00:32:09.260,00:32:15.141,"AFTER ALL, WHAT IS FAITH IF IT DOESN'T ENDURE WHEN WE ARE TESTED THE MOST?"
00:32:20.647,00:32:27.487,WE WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY GOD TOOK JESSICA OR MY FATHER OR ANYONE.
00:32:27.570,00:32:34.786,"AND WHILE GOD MAY NOT GIVE US ANY ANSWERS, HE HAS GIVEN US THE CAPACITY FOR LOVE."
00:32:34.869,00:32:41.167,OUR JOB IS TO LOVE HIM WITHOUT QUESTIONING HIS PLAN.
00:32:41.250,00:32:56.766,"SO I PRAY TO YOU, DEAR LORD, I PRAY TO YOU TO HELP STRENGTHEN OUR LOVE FOR YOU AND TO EMBRACE DEAN AND LEANNE WITH THE WARMTH OF YOUR LOVE IN RETURN."
00:32:56.849,00:33:11.823,AND I PRAY THAT YOU WILL HELP US FEND OFF HATRED SO THAT WE MAY ALL TRULY TRUST IN YOU WITH ALL OUR HEARTS AND LEAN NOT ON OUR OWN UNDERSTANDING.
00:33:13.324,00:33:14.701,AMEN.
00:33:16.369,00:33:18.705,"YOUR JOB IS TO REPORT THE NEWS, NOT BE THE NEWS."
00:33:18.788,00:33:19.914,I WAS PROMOTING THE PAPER.
00:33:19.998,00:33:21.582,YOU WERE PROMOTING ZOE BARNES.
00:33:21.666,00:33:23.918,IS THIS ABOUT HOW I SAID WE CALLED YOU THE HAMMER?
00:33:24.002,00:33:26.045,"- BECAUSE IF THAT UPSET YOU, I APOLOGIZE. - YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT."
00:33:26.129,00:33:33.261,"I DON'T WANT YOU TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS HERE, NOT NICKNAMES, NOT HOW PROGRESSIVE WE ARE, NOT WHETHER WE ARE ADAPTING TO THE INTERNET."
00:33:33.344,00:33:36.931,"ANY THOUGHTS YOU HAVE ABOUT THIS PAPER, YOU KEEP THEM TO YOURSELF, OR YOU BRING THEM TO ME."
00:33:37.015,00:33:42.228,YOU DON'T GET ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND SP-- I'M SORRY. I WASN'T TRYING TO-- DON'T INTERRUPT WHEN I'M TALKING.
00:33:42.311,00:33:44.439,"YOU CAN SPEAK TO ME LIKE AN ADULT, TOM."
00:33:44.522,00:33:46.315,YOU DON'T HAVE TO LECTURE ME LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.
00:33:46.399,00:33:49.819,YOU HAVEN'T EARNED THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED AS AN ADULT.
00:33:49.902,00:33:54.407,YOU THINK A FEW FRONT-PAGE STORIES AND SOME FACE TIME ON TV MAKES YOU THE NEXT JUDY MILLER?
00:33:54.490,00:33:55.825,YOU'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO.
00:33:55.908,00:33:57.577,DON'T BE SO ARROGANT.
00:33:57.660,00:34:03.458,"OKAY, SO YOU THINK WHEN A WOMAN ASKS TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT, THAT'S ARROGANCE?"
00:34:03.541,00:34:05.710,ARE YOU ACCUSING ME OF SEXISM?
00:34:05.793,00:34:07.420,JUST MAKING AN OBSERVATION.
00:34:07.503,00:34:09.172,NO TV FOR A MONTH.
00:34:09.255,00:34:10.673,- WHAT? - YOU HEARD ME.
00:34:10.757,00:34:12.300,NO INTERVIEWS.
00:34:12.383,00:34:13.718,THAT'S COMPLETELY UNFAIR.
00:34:13.801,00:34:16.220,YOU WANT TO MAKE IT NO TV INDEFINITELY?
00:34:18.139,00:34:20.600,WE'RE DONE. YOU CAN GO NOW.
00:34:44.248,00:34:47.085,HELLO?
00:34:47.168,00:34:49.629,"GILLIAN, IT'S CLAIRE UNDERWOOD. CAN I COME UP?"
00:34:59.388,00:35:01.682,HAVE YOU SEEN A DOCTOR?
00:35:01.766,00:35:03.810,GIARDIA'S NOT SO BAD.
00:35:03.893,00:35:07.313,IT'LL PASS IN ANOTHER WEEK OR SO.
00:35:07.396,00:35:09.273,"YOU DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE, DO YOU?"
00:35:09.357,00:35:10.691,NOPE.
00:35:10.775,00:35:13.236,I'LL MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU TO SEE MY PERSONAL GP TOMORROW.
00:35:13.319,00:35:15.029,MEDICINE DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH.
00:35:15.113,00:35:17.031,YOU HAVE TO LET IT RUN ITS COURSE.
00:35:17.115,00:35:19.700,"WELL, WE'LL LET IT RUN ITS COURSE UNDER PROPER SUPERVISION."
00:35:19.784,00:35:21.702,I WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER ON THIS.
00:35:21.786,00:35:24.330,- CLAIRE-- - I'LL DRAG YOU TO THE HOSPITAL MYSELF IF I HAVE TO.
00:35:24.413,00:35:26.499,YOU'RE GOING TO THE DOCTOR. NO ARGUMENT.
00:35:28.626,00:35:30.711,THANKS.
00:35:30.795,00:35:33.047,THEY'RE ABOUT TO WALK. THEY WON'T LISTEN TO A WORD I SAY.
00:35:33.131,00:35:34.632,- BOTH UNIONS? - YEAH.
00:35:34.715,00:35:35.925,PUT MARTY ON THE PHONE.
00:35:36.008,00:35:37.051,HANG ON.
00:35:37.135,00:35:38.553,MARTY.
00:35:38.636,00:35:41.681,YEAH. IT'S FRANK?
00:35:44.183,00:35:45.726,"THIS ISN'T WORKING, FRANK."
00:35:45.810,00:35:48.312,"MARTY, YOU HAVE GOT TO KEEP THEM IN THAT ROOM."
00:35:48.396,00:35:49.939,THEY LOST THEIR PATIENCE.
00:35:50.022,00:35:51.941,"THEY'RE UPSET YOU'RE NOT IN THE ROOM, FRANK."
00:35:52.024,00:35:54.152,"- I'LL BE BACK THIS AFTERNOON. - NO, IT'S TOO LATE."
00:35:54.235,00:35:58.614,"LOOK, TELL THEM I'LL COME DOWN ON SUBSIDIES FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS."
00:35:58.698,00:36:01.617,"EVEN SO, THEY'RE ANGRY ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS."
00:36:01.701,00:36:03.202,WE'RE NOT EVEN HALFWAY THROUGH THIS THING.
00:36:03.286,00:36:09.375,"THERE'S SO MUCH IN IT THAT THEY-- TELL THEM THAT I'LL ROLL OVER ON PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, FIVE-YEAR INTERVALS."
00:36:09.458,00:36:14.380,"IT SHOULD BE YOU TELLING THEM THAT, FRANK, YOU HERE, AT THIS TABLE."
00:36:14.463,00:36:18.301,"I KNOW THAT. I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN, BUT I CAN'T BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE."
00:36:18.384,00:36:26.893,"NOW, LOOK. I PROMISE YOU, IF YOU KEEP THEM IN THAT ROOM, WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS HUMP AS SOON AS I GET BACK."
00:36:26.976,00:36:29.979,"MARTY, YOU ARE THEIR LOBBYIST. YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM."
00:36:30.062,00:36:32.190,SAVE THEM FROM THEMSELVES.
00:36:34.150,00:36:36.652,"OKAY, I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO."
00:36:38.905,00:36:40.239,STAMPER.
00:36:40.323,00:36:45.119,DO NOT LET SPINELLA OUT OF YOUR SIGHT AND LOCK THE GODDAMN DOORS IF YOU HAVE TO.
00:36:45.203,00:36:46.787,YOU GOT IT.
00:36:50.666,00:36:52.251,I KNOW YOU'RE A BUSY MAN. I HOPE WE'RE NOT KEEPING YOU.
00:36:52.335,00:36:54.253,"NO, NO, NO, I'VE GOT ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD."
00:36:54.337,00:36:56.797,THIS IS HAM AND THESE ARE TURKEY.
00:36:56.881,00:36:58.883,AND THERE'S SOME POTATO SALAD.
00:36:58.966,00:37:01.135,SHALL WE HAVE A PRAYER?
00:37:01.219,00:37:02.553,GRACIOUS LOVING GOD...
00:37:02.637,00:37:04.222,HAVE YOU HAD THIS BEFORE?
00:37:04.305,00:37:07.099,THIS IS THE THIRD TIME. I'M USED TO IT BY NOW.
00:37:07.183,00:37:09.435,"WELL, I'M NOT USED TO IT, BUT IT BEATS MALARIA."
00:37:09.518,00:37:10.978,YOU'VE HAD MALARIA.
00:37:11.062,00:37:12.104,IN ZIMBABWE.
00:37:12.188,00:37:13.564,THAT TOOK ME OUT FOR A MONTH.
00:37:13.648,00:37:16.984,YOU MAKE A LOT OF SACRIFICES.
00:37:17.068,00:37:18.819,I DON'T SEE IT AS A SACRIFICE.
00:37:18.903,00:37:23.199,YOU TURNED DOWN A SIX-FIGURE SALARY AT GOOGLE TO START YOUR OWN NON-PROFIT.
00:37:23.282,00:37:25.451,PEOPLE DON'T GET MALARIA IN PALO ALTO.
00:37:28.788,00:37:30.414,YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH.
00:37:30.498,00:37:32.625,WHEN IT'S SOMEONE I CARE ABOUT.
00:37:35.044,00:37:39.048,"CLAIRE, I TURNED DOWN THAT JOB BECAUSE I WOULD'VE HATED MYSELF."
00:37:39.131,00:37:41.133,"IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY, BUT FOR WHAT?"
00:37:41.217,00:37:45.680,SO THEY COULD FULFILL THEIR DIVERSITY QUOTA WITH AN ASIAN GIRL PEDDLING A STANFORD DEGREE?
00:37:45.763,00:37:46.889,NOT JUST ANY ASIAN GIRL.
00:37:46.973,00:37:49.558,A VALEDICTORIAN.
00:37:49.642,00:37:52.645,LET ME OFFER YOU WHAT GOOGLE COULDN'T.
00:37:52.728,00:38:01.195,I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE CAPABLE AND BEAUTIFUL AND AMBITIOUS AND BE ON PEOPLE LIKE SERGEY AND LARRY'S CHECKLIST OF THINGS THAT LOOK GOOD TO HAVE ON A SHELF.
00:38:05.241,00:38:07.535,I'M NOT TRYING TO ACQUISITION YOU.
00:38:07.618,00:38:12.331,"WHAT I SEE IN YOU IS A WOMAN I ADMIRE, WHICH DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN."
00:38:14.375,00:38:15.876,I WANT TO ENABLE YOU.
00:38:15.960,00:38:21.674,"I WANT TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR YOU SO THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE WHAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE, ON YOUR OWN TERMS."
00:38:24.260,00:38:25.845,THANKS FOR THE TEA.
00:38:27.430,00:38:30.808,AND I WILL SEND A CAR TO PICK YOU UP FOR THE DOCTOR TOMORROW.
00:38:30.891,00:38:34.979,"WHEN YOU'RE BACK ON YOUR FEET, DO YOU THINK MAYBE WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT?"
00:38:39.734,00:38:41.652,"YES, I THINK WE COULD."
00:38:44.739,00:38:46.657,THAT'S HER AT JUNIOR PROM.
00:38:48.159,00:38:49.702,BEAUTIFUL.
00:38:53.998,00:38:56.375,HERE SHE IS IN HER LETTER JACKET.
00:38:56.459,00:39:00.713,SHE MADE VARSITY AS A FRESHMAN.
00:39:00.796,00:39:02.590,I REMEMBER THE DAY SHE FOUND OUT.
00:39:02.673,00:39:04.258,COACH CALLED.
00:39:04.342,00:39:06.927,JESSIE STARTS JUMPING UP AND DOWN.
00:39:07.011,00:39:09.263,"MOM, GUESS WHAT?"
00:39:14.977,00:39:16.187,I'M SORRY.
00:39:16.270,00:39:18.105,DON'T BE. IT'S FINE.
00:39:19.648,00:39:20.733,WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
00:39:20.816,00:39:26.364,"HONESTLY, WHAT'S TO BE GAINED IN DREDGING UP ALL THIS STUFF?"
00:39:26.447,00:39:30.201,REMEMBERING THE GOOD THINGS HELPS SOMETIMES-- NOT WHEN IT PUTS MY WIFE IN TEARS.
00:39:31.952,00:39:34.622,"I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID AT THE CHURCH, BUT IT DOESN'T DO US ANY GOOD."
00:39:34.705,00:39:36.123,NEITHER DOES THIS.
00:39:36.207,00:39:37.666,"WELL, WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?"
00:39:37.750,00:39:39.293,YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
00:39:39.377,00:39:41.087,SHE'S GONE.
00:39:41.170,00:39:48.928,"YOU'RE RIGHT. I CAN'T CHANGE THAT, BUT I CAN MAKE SURE THE CITY OFFERS YOU A SIZABLE SETTLEMENT."
00:39:49.011,00:39:50.638,YOU MEAN BUY US OFF?
00:39:50.721,00:39:54.475,"NO, I MEAN HELP YOU AVOIDING YEARS OF COURT BATTLES."
00:39:54.558,00:39:56.310,JESSICA WAS GOING TO GO TO FURMAN.
00:39:56.394,00:39:58.396,IS THAT RIGHT? ON A VOLLEYBALL SCHOLARSHIP?
00:39:58.479,00:40:00.314,"YES, A FULL RIDE."
00:40:00.398,00:40:05.778,"WELL, I SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY THIS MORNING, AND WE'D LIKE TO CREATE A NEW SCHOLARSHIP IN YOUR DAUGHTER'S NAME."
00:40:05.861,00:40:07.029,IF YOU'D LIKE THAT.
00:40:07.113,00:40:08.239,IT'S ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.
00:40:08.322,00:40:12.576,"BUT, MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN."
00:40:12.660,00:40:18.791,"WE'VE GOT SAFETY BILLBOARDS GOING UP, WE'LL STOP LIGHTING THE TOWER AT NIGHT, AND WE'RE PUTTING THE GUARD RAILS IN."
00:40:18.874,00:40:22.336,SHOULD'VE DONE ALL THAT BEFORE SHE RAN OFF THE ROAD.
00:40:22.420,00:40:25.339,"WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO RESIGN, MR. MASTERS?"
00:40:27.133,00:40:28.801,"JUST SAY THE WORD, AND IT'S DONE."
00:40:28.884,00:40:30.970,IF IT WILL BRING YOU ANY SATISFACTION.
00:40:41.564,00:40:48.446,"I ASKED THE REVEREND ONCE, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO IN THE FACE OF SO MUCH SENSELESS PAIN?"
00:40:48.529,00:40:58.831,"AND HE SAID TO ME, WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO BUT TAKE WHAT SEEMS MEANINGLESS AND TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING MEANINGFUL FROM IT."
00:40:58.914,00:41:00.541,HE'S RIGHT.
00:41:00.624,00:41:04.462,THAT'S HOW GOD WORKS-- THROUGH US.
00:41:06.172,00:41:08.924,WILL YOU LET ME WORK FOR YOU?
00:41:15.639,00:41:19.602,WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT MY PEOPLE IS THAT THEY ARE A NOBLE PEOPLE.
00:41:19.685,00:41:22.313,HUMILITY IS THEIR FORM OF PRIDE.
00:41:22.396,00:41:32.198,"IT IS THEIR STRENGTH, IT IS THEIR WEAKNESS, AND IF YOU CAN HUMBLE YOURSELF BEFORE THEM, THEY WILL DO ANYTHING YOU ASK."
00:41:36.118,00:41:38.078,TELL US MORE ABOUT THE SCHOLARSHIP.
00:42:03.145,00:42:05.689,- HEY. - HEY.
00:42:05.773,00:42:07.066,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
00:42:07.149,00:42:08.943,- WORKING. - ON WHAT?
00:42:09.026,00:42:11.820,"THE, UH, BRACK COMMISSION STUFF."
00:42:11.904,00:42:13.864,I'M BEHIND ON IT.
00:42:13.948,00:42:15.991,IT'S SUNDAY.
00:42:18.160,00:42:20.579,YOU DON'T USUALLY WORK ON THE WEEKEND.
00:42:20.663,00:42:22.456,"WELL, NOW I DO."
00:42:22.540,00:42:25.251,"THERE'S, UH, COFFEE IN THE KITCHEN. YOU WANT SOME?"
00:42:28.337,00:42:29.588,PETER...
00:42:33.133,00:42:34.218,PETER.
00:42:35.594,00:42:39.473,"IF I DECIDE TO STAY, IT'S BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I WANT, NOT WHAT YOU WANT."
00:42:44.603,00:42:45.854,I UNDERSTAND.
00:42:49.775,00:42:51.986,WHICH DRAFT ARE YOU READING OF THE WRITTEN TESTIMONY?
00:42:52.069,00:42:53.404,THE ONE YOU SENT ON THURSDAY.
00:42:53.487,00:42:55.614,I ACTUALLY CHANGED IT ON FRIDAY.
00:42:55.698,00:42:56.991,CAN I SHOW YOU?
00:42:59.577,00:43:06.041,"YEAH, I WAS THINKING THAT WE COULD START WITH JOB NUMBERS AND THEN GO TO ECONOMIC MULTIPLIERS INSTEAD OF THE OTHER WAY AROUND."
00:43:06.125,00:43:07.626,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:43:07.710,00:43:09.753,LET'S SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
00:43:28.230,00:43:29.648,PICTURE THIS...
00:43:29.732,00:43:34.862,A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL TRAVELING AT 60 MILES AN HOUR SPINS OUT OF CONTROL IN NO TRAFFIC.
00:43:34.945,00:43:36.280,SHE HITS A GUARD RAIL.
00:43:36.363,00:43:45.205,"BUT IF SHE'S WEARING HER SEATBELT, WHICH SHE WAS, AND HER CAR DOESN'T ROLL OVER THREE TIMES DOWN A 20-FOOT DITCH, WHICH IT DID, THEN THAT YOUNG WOMAN IS STILL ALIVE."
00:43:46.624,00:43:48.250,BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
00:43:48.334,00:43:52.838,"THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR DIDN'T BUILD THOSE GUARD RAILS, SO NOW SHE'S DEAD."
00:43:52.921,00:43:54.632,WE LOOKED UP THE STATUTE.
00:43:54.715,00:43:57.468,GUARD RAILS ARE UNDER COUNTY SUPERVISION.
00:43:59.720,00:44:01.847,ARE YOU TRYING TO TURN THIS AROUND ON ME?
00:44:01.930,00:44:03.140,"THAT'S NOT ALL, ORRIN."
00:44:03.265,00:44:04.558,YOUR EASEMENT.
00:44:04.642,00:44:09.021,"YOU SEE, EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS THE PIEDMONT ELECTRIC, THEY APPLY TO BRING POWER LINES THROUGH GAFFNEY."
00:44:09.104,00:44:10.814,THE ROUTE COMES RIGHT THROUGH YOUR LOT.
00:44:10.898,00:44:14.652,"NOW, GENE AND I ALWAYS FIGHT THEM OFF, BUT THIS YEAR, IF THEY WERE TO REAPPLY, HMM..."
00:44:14.735,00:44:16.195,EMINENT DOMAIN.
00:44:16.278,00:44:19.323,IT WOULD BE SUCH A SHAME TO HAVE TO TEAR DOWN THIS BEAUTIFUL HOME.
00:44:19.448,00:44:20.908,"FUCK YOU, FRANK."
00:44:20.991,00:44:24.495,YOU CAN'T JUST ROLL UP ON MY PROPERTY AND ACT LIKE YOU OWN IT.
00:44:29.792,00:44:31.210,"OH, BUT I CAN."
00:44:31.293,00:44:32.419,WE JUST DID.
00:44:35.923,00:44:38.592,I'VE WON THIS DISTRICT 11 TIMES.
00:44:38.676,00:44:41.679,DO YOU THINK THAT'S JUST LUCK AND A FIRM HANDSHAKE?
00:44:41.762,00:44:44.556,BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'M NOT A VINDICTIVE PERSON.
00:44:44.640,00:44:49.561,"I DON'T LIKE FOR ANYBODY TO LOSE IF EVERYBODY CAN WIN, SO I'M GOING TO HELP YOU GET ELECTED IN THE FOURTH."
00:44:49.645,00:44:51.605,YOU GET TO KEEP YOUR HOUSE. I KEEP THE FIFTH.
00:44:51.688,00:44:54.149,"WE PUT THE PEACHOID BEHIND US, AND EVERYBODY'S HAPPY."
00:44:54.233,00:44:56.276,WHAT DO YOU SAY?
00:44:56.360,00:44:57.694,"WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU THINK ABOUT IT."
00:44:57.778,00:44:59.822,I'M SURE YOU'LL DO THE RIGHT THING.
00:44:59.905,00:45:02.658,"OH, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING YOU IN CONGRESS, ORRIN."
00:45:02.741,00:45:05.702,IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE.
00:45:26.682,00:45:29.017,I'VE BEEN OFFERED A SPOT ON NIGHTLINE.
00:45:31.186,00:45:32.896,I DON'T WANT IT. I NEED IT.
00:45:32.980,00:45:34.398,CLOSE YOUR EYES.
00:45:36.608,00:45:38.277,OKAY.
00:45:38.360,00:45:41.530,IT'S 11:25. NIGHTLINE IS ABOUT TO COME ON.
00:45:41.613,00:45:43.574,MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING.
00:45:43.657,00:45:45.033,"WHERE ARE YOU, HOME?"
00:45:45.117,00:45:46.994,NO.
00:45:47.077,00:45:48.412,AT THE STUDIO?
00:45:48.495,00:45:49.913,YES.
00:45:49.997,00:45:51.457,AND WHAT DO YOU SEE?
00:45:51.540,00:45:53.333,I SEE LIGHTS.
00:45:53.417,00:45:54.751,I SEE A CAMERA.
00:45:54.835,00:45:56.795,AND THAT LITTLE RED DOT GOES ON.
00:45:56.879,00:45:59.089,TELL ME WHAT YOU HEAR?
00:45:59.173,00:46:00.966,I HEAR MY VOICE.
00:46:01.049,00:46:03.927,"AND THOSE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, WHAT DO THEY HEAR?"
00:46:04.011,00:46:05.929,MY VOICE.
00:46:06.013,00:46:07.514,AND WHAT DO THEY SEE?
00:46:07.598,00:46:09.683,MY FACE.
00:46:09.766,00:46:11.185,SO YOU DON'T NEED MY ADVICE.
00:46:14.146,00:46:15.314,HAMMERSCHMIDT'S GOING TO FREAK.
00:46:15.397,00:46:19.193,"YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK ANYWHERE YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO GET FIRED FROM, ZOE."
00:46:19.276,00:46:22.821,TREADING WATER'S THE SAME AS DROWNING FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME.
00:46:22.905,00:46:24.239,GOOD LUCK. I'LL BE WATCHING.
00:46:24.323,00:46:25.782,"- HEY, WAIT. - YES?"
00:46:25.866,00:46:26.992,WHEN DO YOU GET BACK?
00:46:27.075,00:46:30.162,"WHEN I GET BACK, YOU'LL KNOW."
00:46:34.082,00:46:36.168,"HELLO, NANCY."
00:46:36.251,00:46:38.629,"WELCOME BACK, SIR. LINDA VASQUEZ CALLED FOR YOU."
00:46:38.712,00:46:40.130,TELL HER I'LL CALL HER IN A COUPLE HOURS WITH AN UPDATE.
00:46:40.214,00:46:41.715,- VERY WELL. - SIR?
00:46:41.798,00:46:44.968,"UNLESS YOU NEED ANYTHING, KYLE HAS YOU COVERED."
00:46:45.052,00:46:46.720,"NO, GO HOME."
00:46:46.803,00:46:48.096,YOU DID WELL THIS WEEKEND.
00:46:48.180,00:46:49.723,"THANK YOU, SIR."
00:46:49.806,00:46:52.476,"OH, AND BEFORE YOU GO HOME, CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?"
00:46:52.559,00:46:55.521,WOULD YOU SWING BY MY HOUSE AND MAKE SURE THESE GET TO CLAIRE?
00:46:55.604,00:46:57.147,"YES, SIR."
00:46:57.231,00:46:59.274,"AND THANK YOU, SIR, FOR BEING SO PATIENT."
00:47:06.573,00:47:07.866,OKAY.
00:01:45.355,00:01:47.608,SO THAT WE CAN LOCK DOWN PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
00:01:47.691,00:01:50.652,YOU DON'T TOSS AROUND THEIR RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LIKE A POKER CHIP.
00:01:50.736,00:01:52.529,"IF WE DON'T, THEY WON'T BUDGE."
00:01:52.613,00:01:54.406,HAS MARTY SPINELLA SEEN THIS?
00:01:54.489,00:01:56.033,NOT THE VERSION I SHOWED HIM.
00:01:56.116,00:01:57.576,SO YOU LIED TO HIS FACE.
00:01:57.659,00:02:00.161,NO. I REVISED THE PARAMETERS OF MY PROMISE.
00:02:00.245,00:02:01.246,WHICH IS LYING.
00:02:02.664,00:02:04.959,"THE SORT YOU'RE WELL VERSED IN, BOB."
00:02:05.042,00:02:06.418,HERE'S SOME POLITICS FOR YOU.
00:02:06.501,00:02:10.255,"I ALLOW THIS TO GO TO THE FLOOR, I GET MURDERED NEXT ELECTION."
00:02:12.257,00:02:16.971,"LAST TIME I CHECKED, I WAS STILL A DEMOCRAT, FRANK, AND YOU WERE TOO."
00:02:17.054,00:02:19.222,ARE YOU TELLING ME THE PRESIDENT ISN'T?
00:02:19.306,00:02:21.976,BECAUSE HE'S ACTING A HELL OF A LOT LIKE A REPUBLICAN.
00:02:22.059,00:02:23.769,I THOUGHT BOB WAS ON OUR TEAM.
00:02:23.852,00:02:26.105,JUST SIT HIM DOWN WITH THE PRESIDENT TEN MINUTES.
00:02:26.229,00:02:27.940,WE WON'T TOUCH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.
00:02:28.023,00:02:31.276,"ARE YOU INTERESTED IN MY ADVICE ON THIS, OR DO YOU JUST WANT ME TO DELIVER THE MESSAGE?"
00:02:31.359,00:02:33.153,"I'M ALWAYS INTERESTED IN YOUR ADVICE, FRANK."
00:02:33.236,00:02:35.530,BIRCH IS RIGHT. YOU'RE GOING TO BURN A LOT OF BRIDGES.
00:02:35.614,00:02:38.283,THE PRESIDENT SHOULD AT LEAST SIT DOWN WITH HIM AND LET HIM MAKE HIS CASE.
00:02:38.366,00:02:44.623,YOU TELL BOB I'M HAPPY TO SCHEDULE A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT ONCE HE'S SET A DATE TO PUT THIS BILL ON THE FLOOR.
00:02:44.706,00:02:46.249,THE PRESIDENT CAN FUCK HIMSELF.
00:02:46.333,00:02:48.669,THIS IS THE PLATFORM. IT'S WHAT HE RAN ON.
00:02:48.752,00:02:50.462,I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHAT HE RAN ON.
00:02:50.545,00:02:53.090,HE CAN'T STEAMROLL THE HOUSE.
00:02:53.172,00:02:55.634,"AND DON'T FORGET, YOU WORK FOR ME, FRANK, NOT HIM."
00:02:55.717,00:02:59.429,"IF HE WANTS SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR, HE'S GONNA HAVE TO TALK TO ME DIRECTLY."
00:02:59.513,00:03:06.770,"I KNOW YOU TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE IN YOUR MANHOOD, BOB, AND IT'S IMPRESSIVE, BUT AS BIG AS IT IS, LINDA CAN STILL SHUT THE DOOR ON IT."
00:03:08.563,00:03:11.025,TELL VASQUEZ THE BILL IS DEAD.
00:03:14.695,00:03:17.447,THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME HE'S PULLED THAT STUNT ON ME.
00:03:17.531,00:03:21.409,"PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE HELD MY TONGUE, BUT I JUST COULDN'T RESIST THE CHANCE TO SEE HIM SHRIVEL."
00:03:25.288,00:03:26.289,GOOD MORNING.
00:03:26.373,00:03:27.499,FRANK.
00:03:27.582,00:03:29.877,MR. PRESIDENT.
00:03:29.960,00:03:31.795,LINDA.
00:03:31.879,00:03:35.256,LET'S STRIKE THE ANTI-COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROVISION FROM THE BILL.
00:03:35.340,00:03:38.052,"LINDA AND I HAVE TALKED IT OVER, AND I THINK SHE'S RIGHT ON THIS."
00:03:38.135,00:03:39.928,TELL BOB HE CAN COME BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
00:03:40.012,00:03:43.431,"SIR, RESPECTFULLY, I DO NOT THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE HIM THE SATISFACTION."
00:03:43.515,00:03:44.558,"WELL, GIVE ME A REASON."
00:03:44.641,00:03:46.060,MAKES US APPEAR WEAK.
00:03:46.143,00:03:48.770,THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO ESTABLISH YOUR SUPREMACY.
00:03:48.854,00:03:50.271,WE SHOULD SEIZE IT.
00:03:54.776,00:03:55.861,"FRANK, WE DISCUSSED THIS."
00:03:55.944,00:04:00.532,"SIR, IF YOU GIVE IN NOW, BIRCH WILL WALK ALL OVER YOU FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS."
00:04:00.615,00:04:02.993,I CAN GET THIS BILL ON THE HOUSE FLOOR AS IS.
00:04:03.077,00:04:04.285,I PROMISE YOU.
00:04:08.373,00:04:09.875,"ALL RIGHT, FRANK. SHOW ME WHAT YOU CAN DO."
00:04:09.958,00:04:10.959,"THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT."
00:04:15.505,00:04:17.966,THAT WAS HER TRYING TO TAKE CREDIT FOR MY IDEA.
00:04:20.761,00:04:24.556,I WILL NOT ALLOW HER TO SELL MY GOODS WHEN SHE CUTS ME OUT OF THE PROFITS.
00:04:24.639,00:04:26.433,I SPECIFICALLY TOLD HER NO INTERVIEWS.
00:04:26.516,00:04:29.310,SHE DISOBEYED ME-- NOT JUST ONCE.
00:04:29.394,00:04:30.562,AT LEAST EIGHT TIMES IN THE PAST MONTH.
00:04:30.645,00:04:32.106,"SHE STAYS, TOM."
00:04:34.566,00:04:36.526,I SAID SHE STAYS.
00:04:36.610,00:04:38.028,THERE ARE RULES.
00:04:38.112,00:04:39.154,THERE'S A WAY OF DOING THINGS.
00:04:39.238,00:04:43.533,IF I HAVE A REPORTER-- TWO FRESHMEN GIRLS ARE MOVING INTO THEIR DORM ROOM TOGETHER.
00:04:43.617,00:04:46.661,"ONE OF THEM'S FROM GEORGIA, ONE OF THEM'S FROM CONNECTICUT."
00:04:46.745,00:04:49.748,THE GIRL FROM CONNECTICUT'S HELPING HER MOTHER PUT UP CURTAINS.
00:04:49.831,00:04:53.418,"THE GIRL FROM GEORGIA TURNS TO THEM AND SAYS, HI. WHERE Y'ALL FROM?"
00:04:53.501,00:04:58.298,"THE GIRL FROM CONNECTICUT SAYS, WE'RE FROM A PLACE WHERE WE KNOW NOT TO END A SENTENCE WITH A PREPOSITION."
00:04:58.381,00:05:02.177,"THE GIRL FROM GEORGIA SAYS, OH, BEG MY PARDON."
00:05:02.261,00:05:03.386,WHERE Y'ALL FROM...
00:05:03.470,00:05:04.471,CUNT?
00:05:04.554,00:05:06.140,YOU HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE?
00:05:07.724,00:05:10.351,A VERSION OF IT. WITH SOFTER LANGUAGE.
00:05:10.435,00:05:12.146,"TOM, WE DON'T NEED PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THE RULES."
00:05:12.229,00:05:13.939,WE NEED PEOPLE WITH PERSONALITY.
00:05:14.022,00:05:17.358,"WE WANT ZOE'S FACE, HER ENERGY."
00:05:17.442,00:05:19.569,WE WANT TO GET HER ON TV AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
00:05:19.653,00:05:22.114,IT HELPS US CUT THROUGH THE NOISE.
00:05:22.197,00:05:23.282,SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
00:05:26.493,00:05:28.703,"THANK YOU, TOM."
00:05:31.498,00:05:32.833,THANK YOU.
00:05:38.337,00:05:39.338,COME IN.
00:05:41.925,00:05:47.222,"OH. I, UH, THOUGHT-- I WANTED TO SAY HI TO EVELYN."
00:05:47.306,00:05:49.183,EVELYN?
00:05:49.266,00:05:50.642,THIS WAS HER OFFICE.
00:05:50.725,00:05:52.644,I DON'T THINK SHE WORKS HERE ANYMORE.
00:05:52.727,00:05:54.437,- OH. - GILLIAN COLE.
00:05:54.521,00:05:56.064,I CAME ON BOARD A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

00:06:01.611,00:06:03.446,YOU WORK WITH CLAIRE?
00:06:03.530,00:06:04.531,IN A WAY.
00:06:04.614,00:06:06.033,"HELLO, REMY."
00:06:06.116,00:06:07.534,CLAIRE.
00:06:07.617,00:06:08.994,I SEE YOU'VE MET GILLIAN.
00:06:09.077,00:06:10.411,"YES, JUST NOW."
00:06:10.495,00:06:13.290,"SHE'S DOING FANTASTIC WORK FOR US, AS YOU CAN SEE."
00:06:13.372,00:06:21.506,"RED IS COMPLETED WELLS, GREEN, UH, POTENTIAL SITES, YELLOW APPROVED SITES, AND BLUE ARE THE FILTRATION CENTERS."
00:06:21.589,00:06:24.134,NICE. SO YOU LIKING IT HERE?
00:06:24.218,00:06:26.178,YEAH. MY STAFF AND I ARE LOVING IT.
00:06:26.261,00:06:27.637,CLAIRE'S OPENED A LOT OF DOORS FOR US.
00:06:27.721,00:06:29.097,SOUNDS LIKE CLAIRE.
00:06:29.181,00:06:31.099,SHALL WE HEAD TO MY OFFICE?
00:06:31.183,00:06:32.600,"GILLIAN, NICE TO MEET YOU."
00:06:32.684,00:06:34.311,NICE TO MEET YOU.
00:06:35.520,00:06:38.106,THINGS GOT COMPLICATED.
00:06:41.400,00:06:45.989,"I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU'D STEP UP WHEN THINGS WERE DIFFICULT, NOT HOLD THE DONATION HOSTAGE."
00:06:46.073,00:06:47.908,"WELL, THINGS ARE LESS COMPLICATED NOW."
00:06:47.991,00:06:49.784,THE DONATION IS BACK ON THE TABLE.
00:06:52.246,00:06:54.497,I HAD TO FIRE HALF MY STAFF.
00:06:54.581,00:06:55.749,NOW YOU CAN HIRE THEM BACK.
00:06:55.832,00:07:01.755,"SANCORP IS PREPARED TO DOUBLE ITS INITIAL COMMITMENT-- 1.5 MILLION, LUMP SUM, THIS QUARTER."
00:07:01.838,00:07:03.840,- WHY? - PUBLIC RELATIONS. SAME AS BEFORE.
00:07:03.924,00:07:05.759,AND WHAT DO THEY WANT FROM FRANCIS?
00:07:08.636,00:07:09.804,WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE C.W.I.
00:07:09.888,00:07:10.931,BUT WHY DOUBLE IT?
00:07:11.014,00:07:12.349,BECAUSE I SAID THEY SHOULD.
00:07:12.432,00:07:14.142,"THE MORE THEY GIVE, THE MORE YOU CAN DO."
00:07:14.226,00:07:16.436,"THE MORE YOU CAN DO, THE BETTER THEY LOOK."
00:07:16.519,00:07:19.398,"AND THAT'S WHY THEY HIRED GLENDON HILL, TO MAKE THEM LOOK GOOD."
00:07:19.480,00:07:21.775,AND THEY ALSO HIRED YOU TO GET TRACTION IN CONGRESS.
00:07:21.858,00:07:23.193,NOT IN THIS CASE.
00:07:23.277,00:07:25.404,"WE WANT A LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIP, CLAIRE."
00:07:25.486,00:07:27.614,THIS IS AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE.
00:07:27.697,00:07:29.324,WE'RE NOT ATTACHING STRINGS.
00:07:32.911,00:07:34.579,THEY'D REALLY LOVE TO MOVE QUICKLY ON THIS.
00:07:34.662,00:07:37.291,I SAID I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
00:07:37.374,00:07:39.542,"MADELEINE, YOU HAVE TO EMAIL ME THIS SHIT."
00:07:39.626,00:07:41.002,I NEED IT IN WRITING.
00:07:41.086,00:07:43.838,AND WITH MORE THAN AN HOUR'S NOTICE.
00:07:43.922,00:07:47.342,"YEAH, I KNOW THAT, BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE-- WE HAVE A PLAN."
00:07:55.100,00:07:56.435,FINE.
00:07:57.644,00:07:59.438,YEAH. YEAH. BYE.
00:08:03.233,00:08:08.738,MADELEINE HAS DECIDED TO HAVE A SPUR-OF-THE-MOMENT TRIP TO ORLANDO WITH HER LATEST eHARMONY CATCH.
00:08:08.822,00:08:09.823,"NO HEADS-UP, NO WARNING."
00:08:09.906,00:08:10.949,THE KIDS?
00:08:11.032,00:08:12.742,THEY GET OUT OF SCHOOL AT 2:30.
00:08:12.826,00:08:14.744,I CAN DO THE SHIPBUILDERS MEETING.
00:08:14.828,00:08:16.537,YOU SURE?
00:08:16.621,00:08:18.623,"YEAH, IT'S JUST A PUBLIC AFFAIRS TEAM."
00:08:18.706,00:08:20.625,"I'LL BRIEF YOU, AND THEN YOU CAN CALL THEM TOMORROW."
00:08:20.708,00:08:21.835,GO GET YOUR KIDS.
00:08:36.099,00:08:37.100,HEY.
00:08:42.897,00:08:45.942,REMY CAME BY THIS MORNING. TO THE OFFICE.
00:08:46.026,00:08:47.319,WHAT DOES HE WANT?
00:08:47.402,00:08:48.820,THE DONATION'S BACK ON THE TABLE.
00:08:51.823,00:08:54.201,"- YOU SAID NO, RIGHT? - I DIDN'T."
00:08:54.284,00:08:57.204,"HE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING FROM YOU, FRANCIS."
00:08:57.287,00:08:59.206,"COME ON, CLAIRE. YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT."
00:08:59.289,00:09:00.874,I SPECIFICALLY ASKED.
00:09:00.957,00:09:05.003,"MAYBE NOT RIGHT NOW, BUT LOOK, I INVENTED THIS GUY, ALL RIGHT?"
00:09:05.086,00:09:08.131,IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE. YOU OPEN THE-- THINK OF WHAT I CAN DO WITH THIS MONEY.
00:09:08.215,00:09:09.757,I CAN HIRE BACK THE PEOPLE I LET GO.
00:09:09.841,00:09:13.261,I CAN HELP ACCELERATE THE FUNDING FOR THE PROJECTS THAT GILLIAN HAS BROUGHT IN.
00:09:13.345,00:09:15.180,LET'S FIND ANOTHER WAY TO RAISE THE MONEY.
00:09:15.263,00:09:16.764,BUT IT'S RIGHT THERE AT MY FEET.
00:09:16.848,00:09:19.393,"CLAIRE, I HAVE TOO MUCH ON MY PLATE RIGHT NOW."
00:09:19.476,00:09:21.478,I CAN'T HAVE SANCORP BREATHING DOWN MY NECK AGAIN.
00:09:21.561,00:09:24.481,"I CAN'T HAVE REMY-- LOOK, IT IS REMY."
00:09:24.523,00:09:26.607,HE KNOWS ME TOO WELL. IT'S DANGEROUS.
00:09:26.691,00:09:29.652,LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.
00:09:32.113,00:09:33.114,I'M ASKING.
00:09:33.198,00:09:35.075,NO. YOU'RE NOT.
00:09:40.997,00:09:42.040,CLAIRE.
00:09:43.333,00:09:44.625,I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I TOLD HIM.
00:09:44.709,00:09:46.002,WHICH WAS?
00:09:46.086,00:09:47.128,I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
00:09:56.596,00:10:00.808,"I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME TENSION, AND I'M PROBABLY MORE TO BLAME THAN YOU ARE."
00:10:00.892,00:10:02.519,BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT THAT BEHIND US.
00:10:02.602,00:10:07.023,"ZOE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUR NEW WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT."
00:10:08.400,00:10:09.609,WHAT ABOUT JANINE?
00:10:09.692,00:10:11.861,I PROMOTED HER TO MIDWEST BUREAU CHIEF.
00:10:11.945,00:10:13.321,SHE'S OKAY WITH THAT?
00:10:13.405,00:10:14.739,SHE WANTS TO GIVE UP THE WHITE HOUSE?
00:10:14.822,00:10:16.366,IT'S THE DECISION I'VE MADE.
00:10:16.450,00:10:19.911,IT'S JUST THAT JANINE HAS SO MUCH EXPERIENCE.
00:10:19.994,00:10:21.829,I THOUGHT YOU'D BE MORE EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
00:10:21.913,00:10:28.128,I'M SORRY. I-- I JUST THOUGHT YOU BROUGHT ME IN HERE TO... I DON'T KNOW.
00:10:28.211,00:10:29.754,TO FIRE YOU.
00:10:29.837,00:10:31.923,MAYBE.
00:10:32.006,00:10:34.634,WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.
00:10:34.717,00:10:35.718,WE'RE STARTING OVER.
00:10:37.304,00:10:39.931,SO ARE YOU READY TO TAKE THIS ON?
00:10:41.975,00:10:42.976,CAN I THINK ABOUT IT?
00:10:44.685,00:10:47.606,"PEOPLE USUALLY DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT WHEN THEY'RE OFFERED THE WHITE HOUSE, ZOE."
00:10:47.730,00:10:49.065,JUST A DAY OR TWO.
00:10:49.149,00:10:51.859,JANINE IS BOOKED FOR A FLIGHT TO CHICAGO ON FRIDAY.
00:10:51.943,00:10:53.069,I'LL LET YOU KNOW BEFORE THEN.
00:10:53.153,00:10:57.657,"I JUST NEED TO-- THANK YOU. THANK YOU, TOM."
00:11:05.540,00:11:14.090,"DAVID RASMUSSEN IS THE MAJORITY LEADER, WHICH MEANS HE'S ONE STEP ABOVE ME AND ONE BELOW BIRCH, WHICH IS AKIN TO BEING BETWEEN A VERY HUNGRY WOLF AND A VERY QUARRELSOME SHEEP."
00:11:14.174,00:11:17.093,LET'S SEE IF HE STAYS WITH THE HERD OR JOINS THE PACK.
00:11:17.177,00:11:18.970,DAVID. YOU MIND IF I JOIN YOU?
00:11:19.053,00:11:21.389,"PLEASE. A SALAD, HUH?"
00:11:21.473,00:11:23.600,YES. I'M TRYING TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF MYSELF.
00:11:23.682,00:11:24.976,GOOD MAN. DIET?
00:11:25.059,00:11:27.103,"DIET, EXERCISE, EVERYTHING."
00:11:29.147,00:11:31.858,YOU OUGHT TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOURSELF TOO.
00:11:31.941,00:11:34.194,"WELL, THEY SHOULD STOP SERVING SUCH GOOD PIZZA."
00:11:34.277,00:11:36.613,"OH, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE FOOD."
00:11:36.695,00:11:38.239,I'M TALKING ABOUT BIRCH.
00:11:40.741,00:11:44.037,YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO BE SPEAKER UNLESS YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
00:11:44.120,00:11:45.872,I'M VERY SATISFIED WHERE I AM.
00:11:45.955,00:11:47.832,"- OH, COME ON. - FOR THE TIME BEING, YEAH."
00:11:47.915,00:11:49.042,TIME BEING NEVER.
00:11:49.125,00:11:55.756,"THE ONLY WAY YOU BECOME SPEAKER IS IF BIRCH LOSES HIS DISTRICT OR RETIRES, NEITHER OF WHICH IS GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE YOU AND I HAVE DENTURES."
00:11:55.840,00:11:57.342,"I'M NOT HAPPY WHERE THIS CONVERSATION IS GOING, FRANK."
00:11:57.425,00:12:01.054,"IF YOU WANT IT, AND I KNOW YOU DO, THERE'S A WAY."
00:12:01.137,00:12:05.684,OKAY. RIGHT. I CAN'T-- ALL YOU NEED IS A SIMPLE MAJORITY-- 218 VOTES.
00:12:05.766,00:12:09.770,"WE'RE GOING TO GET AT LEAST 205 OUT OF THE G.O.P., AND AFTER THAT, ALL YOU NEED IS 13 DEMOCRATS."
00:12:09.854,00:12:11.439,YOU AND I MAKE TWO.
00:12:11.523,00:12:12.566,ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
00:12:14.359,00:12:17.529,JUST CONSIDER IT FOR A MOMENT.
00:12:19.155,00:12:20.532,YOU WANT TO COLLUDE WITH THE REPUBLICANS?
00:12:20.615,00:12:23.618,"I DON'T WANT TO, BUT I WOULD IF YOU BECOME SPEAKER IN THE PROCESS."
00:12:23.702,00:12:24.952,NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.
00:12:25.036,00:12:26.996,THERE'S A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.
00:12:27.080,00:12:28.331,THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
00:12:28.415,00:12:31.543,THE REPUBLICANS WOULD LOVE A CHANCE TO KNOCK BOB DOWN A PEG OR TWO.
00:12:31.626,00:12:32.751,AND YOU WANT TO HELP THEM.
00:12:32.835,00:12:34.337,I WANT TO HELP US.
00:12:34.421,00:12:37.840,BOB WILL NOT PLAY BALL WITH THE WHITE HOUSE.
00:12:37.924,00:12:39.967,"NOW, YOU'RE A REASONABLE MAN, DAVID, AND HE'S NOT."
00:12:42.679,00:12:44.805,YOU KNOW WHAT I AM?
00:12:44.889,00:12:46.558,I'M A DISCREET MAN.
00:12:46.641,00:12:47.892,YOU'RE LUCKY FOR THAT.
00:12:47.975,00:12:53.356,"I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION THIS TO BOB, BUT IF YOU EVER BRING IT UP AGAIN, I WON'T HAVE A CHOICE."
00:12:56.234,00:12:58.612,LOOKS LIKE HE OPTED FOR THE HERD.
00:13:04.701,00:13:10.789,CLAIRE. I'D LIKE TO PUT AN ORDER FOR THE WATER FILTERS AND THE WELL-DIGGING EQUIPMENT FOR THE SOUTH SUDAN PROJECT.
00:13:10.873,00:13:11.999,CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET?
00:13:12.083,00:13:14.043,"- HOW MUCH? - 200,000."
00:13:14.127,00:13:15.462,FOR ONE PROJECT?
00:13:15.545,00:13:22.552,"I KNOW IT'S A LOT, BUT IT'LL BE OUR FLAGSHIP PROJECT IN AFRICA, AND WE WOULD BE THE FIRST ORGANIZATION THERE TO WORK ON THIS SCALE."
00:13:22.636,00:13:24.929,I'D LIKE TO GO OVER THE SPECIFICS FIRST.
00:13:25.012,00:13:26.306,I HAVE THE BUDGET RIGHT HERE.
00:13:26.389,00:13:28.725,"LET ME JUST GRAB MY MESSAGES, AND THEN I'LL COME IN TO YOU."
00:13:28.807,00:13:31.144,OKAY. I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE.
00:13:31.227,00:13:32.853,ANY CALLS WHILE I WAS OUT?
00:13:32.937,00:13:35.940,"THEY'RE ON THE DESK, AND THIS CAME BY MESSENGER."
00:14:15.980,00:14:17.524,ADAM. IT'S CLAIRE.
00:14:19.984,00:14:23.279,YES. I KNOW. IT HAS.
00:14:25.198,00:14:27.534,NO REASON. I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU.
00:14:32.413,00:14:34.415,I DO HAVE A REASON.
00:14:34.499,00:14:36.626,I NEED TO USE YOU.
00:14:36.710,00:14:38.419,THE WHITE HOUSE IS WHERE NEWS GOES TO DIE.
00:14:38.503,00:14:39.962,EVERYTHING'S CANNED.
00:14:40.046,00:14:42.799,"THESE PERFECTLY PREPARED STATEMENTS-- IT'S A PRESTIGIOUS JOB, ZOE."
00:14:42.882,00:14:45.134,"USED TO BE, WHEN I WAS IN NINTH GRADE."
00:14:45.218,00:14:46.678,NOW IT'S A GRAVEYARD.
00:14:46.761,00:14:54.227,THE ONLY HALFWAY INTERESTING THING THEY DO IS THROW A BIG DINNER PARTY ONCE A YEAR WHERE THEY PAT THEMSELVES ON THE BACK AND RUB SHOULDERS WITH MOVIE STARS.
00:14:55.603,00:15:03.862,"EVERY DAY SINCE YOU STARTED HERE, YOU'VE BEGGED ME TO MOVE YOU UP, AND NOW-- MY GOAL IN LIFE IS NOT TO CLIMB UP THE HERALD'S LADDER ONE RUNG AT A TIME UNTIL I'VE GOT MY OWN STATIONERY."
00:15:03.944,00:15:06.364,SOME OF US VALUE A CAREER AT A PAPER LIKE THIS.
00:15:06.447,00:15:11.244,"I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THAT TO COME OFF-- WELL, IT DID, AND YOU SKIPPED A FEW RUNGS, BY THE WAY."
00:15:16.207,00:15:18.959,I WOULD HAVE KILLED FOR THAT JOB WHEN I FIRST STARTED HERE.
00:15:26.342,00:15:28.678,PUT FICHTNER IN THE LEANING YES COLUMN.
00:15:28.762,00:15:30.221,DON'T YOU THINK HE'S A NEUTRAL?
00:15:30.304,00:15:31.347,HE HATES BIRCH.
00:15:31.431,00:15:33.892,"YEAH, BUT HE OWES BIRCH FOR THE WAYS AND MEANS APPOINTMENT."
00:15:33.974,00:15:35.101,PUT HIM IN NEUTRAL. WHO ELSE?
00:15:37.144,00:15:39.063,RAMIREZ IS A NEUTRAL?
00:15:39.146,00:15:41.315,"OH, THIS LIST IS SO SHAKY."
00:15:41.399,00:15:47.864,"ANY ONE OF THEM LEAKS IT TO BOB-- NO, WHAT WE NEED IS ONE NAME, ONE PERSON WHO CAN DELIVER 12."
00:15:49.156,00:15:50.533,THE BLACK CAUCUS.
00:15:53.369,00:15:54.746,WOMACK.
00:15:54.829,00:15:55.914,WHAT CAN WE OFFER HIM?
00:15:55.996,00:15:56.997,WHAT DOES HE NEED?
00:15:57.081,00:15:58.499,LET ME PULL UP HIS FILE.
00:16:02.796,00:16:04.213,HERE WE GO.
00:16:04.297,00:16:07.717,"McCUDDEN AIR FORCE BASE EMPLOYS 3,000 PEOPLE IN HIS DISTRICT."
00:16:07.801,00:16:09.302,IT'S ON THE D.O.D.'S CHOPPING BLOCK THIS YEAR.
00:16:09.385,00:16:10.887,WHO DO WE KNOW ON THE BRACK COMMISSION?
00:16:10.970,00:16:12.680,THAT'S DANGEROUS.
00:16:12.764,00:16:15.767,THE TRAIL LEADS BACK TO US TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE D.O.D. OR THE BRACK...
00:16:18.060,00:16:21.898,WE LEAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THE D.O.D.'S BUDGET TO KEEP WOMACK'S BASE OFF THE LIST.
00:16:21.940,00:16:23.190,WHAT WE NEED...
00:16:28.822,00:16:30.615,IS SOMEONE WE OWN.
00:16:33.660,00:16:35.495,"DAD, I'M HUNGRY."
00:16:36.913,00:16:39.165,HERE WE GO.
00:16:39.248,00:16:41.501,WITH CHEESE.
00:16:44.420,00:16:45.672,"UM, DAD?"
00:16:45.755,00:16:46.881,YEAH.
00:16:46.965,00:16:48.883,THAT LOOKS PRETTY DISGUSTING.
00:16:50.134,00:16:52.094,"YEAH, IT LOOKS DISGUSTING."
00:16:52.178,00:16:54.722,"IT'S NOT HOW IT LOOKS, IT'S HOW IT TASTES."
00:16:56.808,00:16:58.893,SHIT. OKAY. HOLD ON.
00:17:03.105,00:17:04.398,HELLO.
00:17:06.066,00:17:07.443,THERE'S A MR. UNDERWOOD HERE TO SEE YOU.
00:17:07.527,00:17:10.237,UH... OKAY. SEND HIM UP.
00:17:24.335,00:17:25.586,"HI, THERE."
00:17:25.670,00:17:27.630,- HI. - HI.
00:17:27.714,00:17:29.590,"THIS IS KEVIN, THIS IS SARA."
00:17:29.674,00:17:31.592,HI. I'M FRANK. NICE TO MEET YOU BOTH.
00:17:31.676,00:17:33.427,- DO YOU WORK WITH DAD? - I DO.
00:17:33.511,00:17:35.471,CONGRESSMAN UNDERWOOD IS DADDY'S BOSS.
00:17:35.555,00:17:38.182,I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BOSS.
00:17:38.265,00:17:41.060,"EVERYBODY HAS A BOSS, SWEETHEART, EVEN CONGRESSMEN."
00:17:41.143,00:17:42.436,WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR DINNER AND GO INTO THE BEDROOM?
00:17:42.520,00:17:44.313,- BUT I WANTED TO WATCH TV. - GO NOW.
00:17:45.732,00:17:46.733,CUTE KIDS.
00:17:46.816,00:17:48.067,"YEAH, I LIKE THEM."
00:17:48.150,00:17:49.276,CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?
00:17:49.360,00:17:51.237,"NO, I WON'T BE HERE LONG."
00:17:51.320,00:17:53.447,YEAH. HAVE A SEAT.
00:17:53.531,00:17:54.699,"OH, THANKS."
00:17:54.782,00:17:56.659,IS THAT A PS VITA?
00:17:59.913,00:18:02.040,WHICH GAMES DOES HE HAVE?
00:18:02.122,00:18:03.541,ALL OF THEM.
00:18:03.624,00:18:04.751,I HAVE A CONSOLE AT HOME.
00:18:04.834,00:18:06.335,I PLAY SOMETIMES TO RELAX.
00:18:06.419,00:18:08.254,I OUGHT TO GET ONE OF THESE FOR THE CAR.
00:18:11.049,00:18:15.636,"SO, PETER, WE NEED TO CLOSE THE SHIPYARD IN YOUR DISTRICT."
00:18:15.720,00:18:17.013,THE BRACK HEARING IS TOMORROW.
00:18:17.096,00:18:18.431,YOU WON'T PUT UP YOUR USUAL FIGHT.
00:18:18.514,00:18:20.391,YOU HAVE ZERO TESTIMONY TO ADD.
00:18:23.895,00:18:25.145,"YES, YOU CAN, PETER."
00:18:25.229,00:18:26.689,I SPENT MONTHS ON THAT TESTIMONY.
00:18:26.773,00:18:32.737,"I LOBBIED THE COMMISSION. MY ENTIRE OFFICE-- I'M SURE YOU'VE DONE SPLENDID WORK, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT CAN'T COME TO FRUITION."
00:18:32.820,00:18:34.864,- WHY? - POLITICS.
00:18:34.948,00:18:36.866,THERE'S FORCES BIGGER THAN EITHER OF US AT PLAY HERE.
00:18:36.950,00:18:38.200,"IT'S 12,000 JOBS."
00:18:38.284,00:18:39.744,I KNOW. IT'S A SHAME.
00:18:39.827,00:18:41.871,KEEPING THAT SHIPYARD OPEN IS WHAT GOT ME ELECTED.
00:18:41.955,00:18:43.497,THOSE PEOPLE ARE MY FRIENDS.
00:18:43.581,00:18:45.499,"I'M NOT HERE TO DEBATE THIS, PETER."
00:18:45.583,00:18:47.710,THE BASE WILL CLOSE.
00:18:47.794,00:18:50.880,"THE ONLY QUESTION IS, WILL YOU MAKE IT A SWIFT DEATH OR A PAINFUL ONE?"
00:18:52.757,00:18:55.051,NO WAY. I WON'T SIT ON MY HANDS.
00:18:55.134,00:18:57.887,I SYMPATHIZE THAT THIS IS GONNA BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU.
00:18:57.971,00:19:02.725,"AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YET, BUT I WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU, PETER."
00:19:02.809,00:19:10.357,"I'M A POWERFUL FRIEND TO HAVE RIGHT NOW, PERHAPS YOUR ONLY FRIEND, SO DON'T DEFY ME."
00:19:24.789,00:19:29.752,MOST POLITICIANS ARE PERMANENTLY CHAINED TO THAT SLOGAN-- FAMILY VALUES.
00:19:29.836,00:19:35.133,"BUT WHEN YOU COZY UP TO HOOKERS AND I FIND OUT, I WILL MAKE THAT HYPOCRISY HURT."
00:19:42.849,00:19:45.267,YOU WOULDN'T REALLY CALL IT A PRESENT.
00:19:45.351,00:19:48.688,"WELL, MORE OF A GENTLE REMINDER, MAYBE."
00:19:48.771,00:19:52.399,"MM, MORE HEAVY-HANDED THAN GENTLE, WHICH SURPRISED ME."
00:19:52.483,00:19:54.110,"IT'S NOT REALLY YOUR STYLE, FRANCIS."
00:19:54.193,00:19:57.321,"BUT, YES. I GOT IT."
00:19:57.404,00:19:59.866,I LIKE THAT ONE.
00:19:59.949,00:20:01.117,I DO TOO.
00:20:01.200,00:20:02.409,BUT THE FIRST ONE'S BETTER.
00:20:02.493,00:20:04.078,YOU THINK?
00:20:04.162,00:20:06.080,SOMETHING SPECIAL TOMORROW?
00:20:06.164,00:20:08.124,ADAM GALLOWAY'S COMING DOWN FROM NEW YORK.
00:20:08.207,00:20:09.416,WHAT FOR?
00:20:09.500,00:20:13.838,BECAUSE I NEED SOME OF HIS PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE SILENT AUCTION AT THE GALA NEXT MONTH.
00:20:18.551,00:20:20.302,I HAVEN'T.
00:20:23.139,00:20:25.599,"IF YOU WANT TO LOOK INVITING, WEAR THE BLACK ONE."
00:20:29.854,00:20:31.189,HELLO.
00:20:31.271,00:20:35.109,OH. OKAY. GREAT. THANKS.
00:20:42.366,00:20:43.409,ADAM?
00:20:51.209,00:20:54.587,HOW IS IT THE WORLD KEEPS SPINNING AND YOU MANAGE TO STAY AHEAD OF IT?
00:20:58.174,00:20:59.258,DAVID'S ON BOARD WITH THIS?
00:20:59.341,00:21:00.634,IT WAS HIS IDEA.
00:21:00.718,00:21:01.802,THEN WHY ISN'T HE HERE?
00:21:01.886,00:21:04.055,"WELL, WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL UNTIL IT'S A DONE DEAL."
00:21:04.138,00:21:05.264,"I DON'T KNOW, FRANK."
00:21:05.347,00:21:06.348,"THINK ABOUT IT, TERRY."
00:21:06.432,00:21:10.728,YOU COULD BECOME THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAJORITY LEADER IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS.
00:21:10.811,00:21:13.313,LET'S MAKE SOME HISTORY.
00:21:15.066,00:21:16.734,YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT HISTORY.
00:21:16.817,00:21:19.195,YOU JUST WANTED ME BECAUSE I CAN ROUND UP THE VOTES.
00:21:19.278,00:21:25.284,"I NEED THE VOTES, AND I DO CARE ABOUT HISTORY, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, TERRY, YOU KNOW HOW TO LEAD."
00:21:25.367,00:21:27.411,YOU'RE THE HEAD OF THE BLACK CAUCUS FOR A REASON.
00:21:29.538,00:21:32.917,"SO DAVID BECOMES SPEAKER, I BECOME MAJORITY LEADER-- AND I STAY ON AS WHIP."
00:21:33.000,00:21:35.502,WHY DON'T YOU WANT MAJORITY LEADER FOR YOURSELF?
00:21:35.586,00:21:37.213,I'M SATISFIED WHERE I AM.
00:21:37.296,00:21:40.716,"MAYBE ONE DAY, WHEN YOU BECOME SPEAKER, YOU'LL BUMP ME UP."
00:21:40.800,00:21:42.551,THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THAT THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.
00:21:44.053,00:21:45.763,I CAN THROW A CHERRY ON TOP.
00:21:47.974,00:21:49.142,McCUDDEN STAYS OPEN.
00:21:50.935,00:21:51.936,HOW?
00:21:52.019,00:21:53.646,YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW.
00:21:53.729,00:21:57.150,"YOU JUST WANT THE HEADLINE WHEN YOU KEEP 3,000 JOBS IN YOUR DISTRICT."
00:22:01.320,00:22:03.114,- TWELVE VOTES? - TWELVE VOTES.
00:22:03.197,00:22:05.032,"I CAN GET YOU 10, PROBABLY 11."
00:22:05.116,00:22:10.830,IT'S SO REFRESHING TO WORK WITH SOMEONE WHO WILL THROW A SADDLE ON A GIFT HORSE RATHER THAN LOOK IT IN THE MOUTH.
00:22:26.929,00:22:28.264,WOW.
00:22:31.684,00:22:33.269,HER NAME WAS TIALA.
00:22:33.351,00:22:35.479,SHE DIED THREE WEEKS AFTER I TOOK THAT PICTURE.
00:22:35.562,00:22:37.064,"OH, THAT'S AWFUL."
00:22:40.985,00:22:42.444,I LOVE YOUR HAIR SHORT.
00:22:46.240,00:22:47.365,DO YOU HAVE PLANS TONIGHT?

00:23:00.378,00:23:02.340,I DON'T BOOK ROUND-TRIP TICKETS.
00:23:05.801,00:23:07.636,IT'S GOING TO BE A WHILE BEFORE I CAN LEAVE.
00:23:07.720,00:23:09.013,WHAT TIME WILL YOU BE DONE?
00:23:11.932,00:23:13.475,PROBABLY AROUND 8:00.
00:23:15.061,00:23:18.480,"I'LL PICK A PLACE, LET YOU KNOW."
00:23:31.660,00:23:33.037,AH. DAVID.
00:23:33.120,00:23:35.289,"HOW ARE YOU, JOE?"

00:24:40.771,00:24:42.440,THANK YOU.
00:24:42.564,00:24:44.358,SIT DOWN. YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.
00:24:51.073,00:24:53.784,"- YOU STILL SMOKE? - FROM TIME TO TIME, YES."
00:24:56.329,00:24:59.581,I QUIT. THESE ARE AN ILLUSION.

00:26:18.411,00:26:20.620,WE CAN'T START THIS AGAIN.
00:26:20.704,00:26:23.581,"WHEN I END SOMETHING, I END IT."
00:26:23.665,00:26:27.336,SO WHY'D YOU HAVE ME COME ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM NEW YORK?
00:26:27.420,00:26:29.380,IT WAS A MISTAKE.
00:26:31.090,00:26:32.632,"I'M SORRY, ADAM."
00:26:32.716,00:26:34.176,I SHOULD'VE KEPT IT BUSINESS.

00:27:43.162,00:27:45.289,I APPRECIATE THAT THIS WAS NOT EASY.
00:27:45.372,00:27:47.500,"WELL, WE DON'T LIKE EASY, DO WE?"
00:27:47.583,00:27:51.003,"OH, THE EVIDENCE WOULD SUGGEST IT."
00:27:51.086,00:27:54.089,IS IT ALL RIGHT IF THE HOLBURNS COME OVER FOR DINNER WEDNESDAY NIGHT?
00:27:54.173,00:27:56.509,I WANT FELICITY TO BUY SOME TABLES FOR THE GALA.
00:27:56.592,00:27:59.136,"YEAH, OF COURSE."

00:28:09.146,00:28:11.357,ADAM DONATED TEN PHOTOGRAPHS.
00:28:11.440,00:28:13.275,THAT WAS GENEROUS OF HIM.
00:28:17.029,00:28:19.323,HE'S STAYING AT THE MANDARIN.
00:28:21.033,00:28:23.410,AND YOU?

00:28:35.381,00:28:38.258,STEMS FAR BEYOND IT'S STRATEGIC GEOGRAPHIC VALUE.
00:28:38.342,00:28:45.849,A.P.G.'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MILITARY MATERIEL IS CENTRAL TO OUR NATION'S COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS.
00:28:45.932,00:28:53.857,THE BASE HOUSES RESEARCH LABORATORIES FOR PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE AS WELL AS A WIDE VARIETY OF TRAINING GROUNDS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL.
00:28:53.940,00:28:56.860,A.P.G. IS ALSO A JOB CREATOR.
00:28:56.943,00:29:04.076,"IT PROVIDES 400 MILLION DOLLARS IN PAYROLL ANNUALLY, AND NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN CONTRACTS."
00:29:04.159,00:29:07.246,THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY.
00:29:10.583,00:29:12.501,NO.

00:29:19.341,00:29:21.051,SO NOTED AND REMOVED.
00:29:22.386,00:29:26.599,"OKAY, WE'LL NEXT CONSIDER THE PHILADELPHIA NAVAL SHIPYARD."
00:29:26.682,00:29:31.228,WOULD THE CONGRESSMAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA'S FIRST DISTRICT LIKE TO OFFER TESTIMONY?
00:29:39.695,00:29:41.530,I HAVE NO TESTIMONY TO OFFER.
00:29:48.328,00:29:50.789,"YEAH, BUT THE DIFFERENCE THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE..."
00:29:50.872,00:29:53.250,"UH, TERRY, LET ME CALL YOU RIGHT BACK."
00:29:55.127,00:29:57.045,POSSIBLY.
00:29:57.129,00:30:01.216,I'VE HAD THREE MEMBERS OF THE BLACK CAUCUS TELL ME THEY'RE BACKING MY PLAY FOR THE SPEAKERSHIP.
00:30:01.300,00:30:05.304,- INTERESTING. - I HAVE A SENSE YOU'VE BEEN DISSEMINATING SOME MISINFORMATION.
00:30:05.387,00:30:07.806,"NO. I'M AFRAID IT'S YOU WHO ARE MISINFORMED, DAVID."
00:30:07.889,00:30:10.601,YOU DON'T HAVE THREE MEMBERS BACKING YOU. YOU HAVE TEN.
00:30:13.771,00:30:15.188,"YES, YOU MADE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR."
00:30:15.272,00:30:16.856,THEN WHY ARE YOU TELLING PEOPLE?
00:30:16.940,00:30:19.151,BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW YOU MADE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR.
00:30:19.234,00:30:20.611,I HAVE TO GO TO BOB WITH THIS.
00:30:26.659,00:30:36.335,"DAVID, IF I PICK UP THIS PHONE RIGHT NOW AND LEAK THIS STORY, BOB WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DROP YOU, EVEN IF HE BELIEVES YOUR VERSION OF EVENTS."
00:30:39.588,00:30:41.423,YOU WANNA TAKE A SEAT?
00:30:45.135,00:30:47.304,"- UH, FREDDY? - YEAH, FRANK?"

00:31:10.076,00:31:11.787,- HERE? - NO.
00:31:11.870,00:31:13.455,STATE FAIR DOWN IN VIRGINIA.
00:31:13.539,00:31:19.294,"ME AND MY BROTHER HAULING THIS SMOKER DOWN THERE, AND THIS FUCKING MINIVAN HAD A FRIDGE STRAPPED ON TOP."
00:31:19.378,00:31:22.506,"A FRIDGE STRAPPED ON TOP OF A MINIVAN, FRANK."
00:31:24.090,00:31:25.592,"WELL, THAT FRIDGE SLIPPED LOOSE."
00:31:25.676,00:31:27.594,BOOM! RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.
00:31:27.678,00:31:29.596,I HAD TO SWERVE TO THE LEFT. BARELY MISSED IT.
00:31:29.680,00:31:33.809,"BUT NOW THAT SMOKER IS FISHTAILING, ALMOST HIT A HATCHBACK IN THE NEXT LANE."
00:31:33.892,00:31:35.977,SWERVED TO THE RIGHT. BARELY MISSED THAT TOO.
00:31:38.021,00:31:40.232,"BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY GOD GAVE US REFLEXES."
00:31:40.315,00:31:45.445,SO WE CAN MOVE THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY WHEN A FRIDGE COME OUT OF NOWHERE.
00:31:45.529,00:31:48.448,- HOW THEM RIBS? - YOU KNOW HOW THEY ARE.
00:31:48.532,00:31:51.951,"- YOU KNOW I LIKE TO HEAR IT. - PERFECTION, FREDDY."
00:31:54.037,00:31:56.456,"- YOU GO ON AHEAD, FRANK. - THANK YOU, FREDDY."
00:31:56.540,00:31:57.916,MM-HMM.
00:31:57.999,00:31:59.752,"WELL, THIS IS A SURPRISE."
00:31:59.835,00:32:02.045,- YOU USUALLY TEXT. - WHERE ARE YOU?
00:32:02.128,00:32:05.632,ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS TRYING TO FIND THE MEANING OF LIFE.
00:32:05.716,00:32:07.259,DID YOU FIND ANYTHING FOR ME?
00:32:07.342,00:32:09.010,YOU MEAN ANYTHING NEWSWORTHY?
00:32:09.094,00:32:12.013,"UH, I ACTUALLY DIDN'T CALL TO BADGER YOU."
00:32:12.097,00:32:14.307,"YES, YOU DID, BUT THAT'S PART OF YOUR CHARM."
00:32:14.391,00:32:15.475,NO.
00:32:15.559,00:32:21.440,I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I'VE BEEN PROMOTED TO WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT.
00:32:26.779,00:32:32.534,"I'LL HAVE TO TRAVEL WITH THE PRESS CORPS, BE AT BRIEFINGS, BUT I CAN WORK AROUND ALL THAT."
00:32:32.618,00:32:34.787,IF YOU NEED ME. IT WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.
00:32:34.870,00:32:36.413,"OH, ON THE CONTRARY."
00:32:36.496,00:32:37.997,THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.
00:32:38.081,00:32:39.708,NO. I CAN BE FLEXIBLE.
00:32:39.792,00:32:44.003,"I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SOMEONE WHO'S FLEXIBLE, I'M INTERESTED IN SOMEONE WHO'S AVAILABLE."
00:32:44.087,00:32:45.547,SO YOU THINK I SHOULD TURN IT DOWN?
00:32:45.631,00:32:47.299,THAT'S ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.
00:32:47.382,00:32:49.927,"WELL, I MEAN, IT'S NOT OFFICIAL YET."
00:32:50.009,00:32:55.098,"- I COULD-- - OH, LOOK, I'VE GOT TO GO, BUT CALL ME, YOU KNOW, IF YOU FIND YOURSELF AVAILABLE AGAIN."
00:33:00.520,00:33:05.901,"YOU SEE, FREDDY BELIEVES THAT IF A FRIDGE FALLS OFF A MINIVAN, YOU BETTER SWERVE OUT OF ITS WAY."
00:33:05.984,00:33:08.862,I BELIEVE IT'S THE FRIDGE'S JOB TO SWERVE OUT OF MINE.
00:33:17.704,00:33:22.835,"HEY, JANINE-- KEEP WALKING, ZOE. I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW."
00:33:24.795,00:33:26.880,"- HE JUST CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE, AND-- - OH, PLEASE."
00:33:26.964,00:33:30.843,YOU'VE BEEN GUNNING FOR MY JOB SINCE THE DAY YOU BOUNCED IN HERE WITH A LOLLIPOP IN YOUR MOUTH.
00:33:30.926,00:33:32.260,CONGRATULATIONS.
00:33:32.344,00:33:36.306,"I'LL SEND YOU A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE FROM THE MIDDLE WEST, WHEREVER THE FUCK THAT IS."
00:33:36.389,00:33:39.351,I'M GONNA TURN IT DOWN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.

00:33:43.647,00:33:45.816,I DON'T WANT IT. I NEVER DID.
00:33:47.526,00:33:49.945,I WAS HOPING WE COULD GO SEE TOM TOGETHER.
00:33:53.031,00:33:55.283,I'M ASKING. FOR REAL. I DON'T WANT THE JOB.

00:34:38.702,00:34:41.079,"UH, WHEN WAS THAT?"
00:34:41.162,00:34:44.791,WHEN HE DROPPED US HOME FROM SCHOOL.
00:34:44.875,00:34:46.835,HE LEFT HIS PHONE HERE.
00:34:49.295,00:34:51.840,ARE YOU DAD'S GIRLFRIEND?
00:34:51.924,00:34:55.134,"NO. NO. I, UH-- I JUST-- I-- I WORK FOR YOUR DAD."

00:34:59.973,00:35:02.225,WILL YOU MAKE US POP-TARTS?
00:35:02.308,00:35:05.478,AN ENORMOUS 60-FOOT ROGUE WAVE STRUCK THE ALEUTIAN...
00:35:05.562,00:35:07.731,"IT WAS JUST SUBLIME, CLAIRE."
00:35:09.942,00:35:12.485,DOES THAT MEAN NO ROOM FOR DESSERT?
00:35:12.569,00:35:14.613,"I'D LOVE TO, BUT, UH, NONE FOR ME."

00:38:48.827,00:38:52.371,"NO, I DIDN'T. BUT I SHOULD HAVE."
00:38:52.455,00:38:57.002,"I TOLD HER THAT YOU HAD TO TRAVEL FOR WORK, WHICH IS THE LAST TIME I EVER LIE FOR YOU."
00:38:59.296,00:39:02.799,"LOOK-- WHAT HAPPENED, PETER?"
00:39:02.882,00:39:05.718,I'M-- I'M SORRY ABOUT THE BRACK HEARING.

00:39:28.825,00:39:31.577,"- I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME, FRANK. - I'LL MAKE IT SHORT."
00:39:31.661,00:39:33.621,- THE PRESIDENT? - NO. THE SPEAKERSHIP.
00:39:33.705,00:39:35.248,DAVID'S MAKING A PLAY.
00:39:35.332,00:39:37.667,- WHAT? - HE CAME TO ME FOR SUPPORT.
00:39:37.750,00:39:44.465,"MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO TELL YOU RIGHT AWAY, BUT THEN MY SECOND THOUGHT WAS TO IGNORE MY FIRST THOUGHT, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE VOTES, BOB."
00:39:44.549,00:39:46.885,"IF THERE HAD BEEN A PARTY REVOLT, I WOULD'VE KNOWN ABOUT IT."
00:39:46.968,00:39:52.265,"WE DON'T NEED THE WHOLE PARTY TO REVOLT. WE NEED 13-- THIRTEEN DEMOCRATS, PLUS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE."
00:39:52.349,00:39:53.892,ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
00:39:53.975,00:39:55.894,PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING ME THAT A LOT LATELY.
00:39:55.977,00:39:57.395,I'M INCLINED TO START SAYING YES.
00:39:57.478,00:39:59.689,WHO ARE THEY-- THE 13?
00:39:59.772,00:40:04.277,"DAVID AND I ARE TWO, TERRY WOMACK, AND TEN MEMBERS OF THE BLACK CAUCUS MAKE ANOTHER 11."
00:40:04.361,00:40:06.071,IS THE PRESIDENT BEHIND THIS?
00:40:06.154,00:40:07.488,NO. HE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE.
00:40:07.572,00:40:10.325,THIS WAS DAVID'S PLAN EXECUTED BY ME.
00:40:10.408,00:40:12.327,"BUT THERE IS AN OUT FOR YOU, BOB."
00:40:12.410,00:40:18.541,I CAN SWAY WOMACK EITHER WAY AS LONG AS YOU MAKE HIM THE NEXT MAJORITY LEADER.
00:40:18.624,00:40:20.668,AND...
00:40:20.752,00:40:23.129,- THE EDUCATION BILL. - NOW WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.
00:40:23.213,00:40:25.257,I CAN'T DO THAT. YOU KNOW I CAN'T.
00:40:25.340,00:40:28.426,"YOU'RE THE SPEAKER, BOB. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE."
00:40:33.723,00:40:36.559,"WHY, THAT ISN'T A BAD LEGACY TO HAVE."
00:40:38.103,00:40:40.272,I'M SORRY. I CHANGED MY MIND.
00:40:40.355,00:40:44.734,"I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND-- THINKING ABOUT IT WAS WHAT THOSE TWO DAYS WERE FOR."
00:40:44.817,00:40:49.781,"AND THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT SOME MORE, AND I REALIZED I-- JESUS CHRIST, YOU'RE FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE."
00:40:49.864,00:40:54.702,"LOOK, TOM, I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU TOOK A CHANCE ON ME, BUT-- NO, I DON'T THINK YOU DO."
00:40:54.786,00:40:57.247,I DON'T THINK YOU APPRECIATE ANYTHING.
00:40:57.330,00:41:01.918,"I THINK YOU'RE AN UNGRATEFUL, SELF-ENTITLED LITTLE C-- LITTLE WHAT?"
00:41:02.001,00:41:04.837,"LITTLE WHAT, TOM? SAY IT."
00:41:04.921,00:41:07.715,CUNT. YOU'RE A CUNT.

00:41:14.597,00:41:18.726,DON'T YOU DARE-- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M TYPING.
00:41:18.810,00:41:20.728,"- GET OUT, ZOE. - JUST A SECOND. I'M ALMOST DONE."
00:41:20.812,00:41:23.648,GET OUT. YOU'RE FIRED.
00:41:23.731,00:41:26.401,"WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO TELL YOURSELF, TOM."

00:41:29.279,00:41:31.239,SO SHOULD I PRESS SEND?
00:41:31.323,00:41:33.241,I THINK I SHOULD.
00:41:36.744,00:41:43.876,"CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT YOU SHOULD REMEMBER, THESE DAYS, WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO ONE PERSON, YOU'RE TALKING TO A THOUSAND."
00:42:02.770,00:42:04.689,FOCUSING ON YOUR HOME DISTRICT.
00:42:04.772,00:42:07.525,YOU'LL SAY WOMACK IS THE RIGHT MAN TO FILL YOUR SHOES.
00:42:07.608,00:42:10.695,YOU WON'T MAKE WAVES. YOU WON'T DO INTERVIEWS.
00:42:10.778,00:42:12.947,YOU'LL SUCK IT UP AND BE A TEAM PLAYER.
00:42:14.115,00:42:15.658,THIS WAS FRANK'S IDEA.
00:42:15.741,00:42:17.869,I TOLD YOU HE WAS GONNA TRY TO BLAME ME ON IT.
00:42:19.578,00:42:21.080,I DID. HE SAID YOU CAME TO HIM.
00:42:21.164,00:42:25.543,"HE'S FUCKING LYING, BOB! I WOULD NEVER-- SHUT UP, DAVID."
00:42:25.626,00:42:30.215,DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE TO BEHAVE WHEN WE MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT?
00:42:30.298,00:42:32.050,AND IF I DON'T PLAY ALONG?
00:42:32.133,00:42:38.139,THEN THE D-TRIPLE-C WILL POUR EVERYTHING IT'S GOT INTO YOUR PRIMARY OPPONENT'S CAMPAIGN NEXT CYCLE.

00:42:54.155,00:42:56.908,"IF YOU THINK IT'S BEST, ROBERT."
00:42:56.991,00:42:59.952,"AND JUST THINK, HE COULD HAVE BEEN A WOLF."

00:00:33.074,00:00:36.912,"SIX MONTHS FROM NOW, SLUGLINE WILL BE WHAT POLITICO WAS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO."
00:00:36.996,00:00:40.123,"EVERYONE AT POLITICO READS IT, BECAUSE SLUGLINE'S BREAKING STORIES BEFORE THEY ARE."
00:00:40.207,00:00:41.876,I WONDER WHY I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.
00:00:41.959,00:00:45.713,"EVERYONE'S A FREE AGENT. THEY WRITE WHATEVER THEY WANT, WHEREVER THEY ARE."

00:05:43.718,00:05:46.387,HE WANTS TO RIP MY HEAD OFF AND PEEL IT LIKE AN ORANGE.
00:05:52.727,00:05:55.230,- I'LL CALL YOU BACK. - MARTY.
00:05:58.357,00:06:00.319,"NO, NO. YOU LIED TO MY FUCKING FACE?"
00:06:00.401,00:06:08.618,"- MARTY, I DID NOT LIE. - DID NOT-- WE SPENT THE WHOLE WEEKEND IN THAT ROOM PORING OVER THIS BILL LINE BY LINE, AND NOWHERE DID IT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING."
00:06:08.702,00:06:11.955,"LET'S CALM DOWN AND SIT DOWN, AND WE WILL DISCUSS THIS."
00:06:12.039,00:06:16.543,"I WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON, AND WE WILL TALK IT OUT NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES."
00:06:16.626,00:06:26.803,"NO, NO MORE. THIS IS GONNA BE A VERY SHORT MEETING, 'CAUSE ONLY ONE OF TWO THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN: EITHER YOU ASSURE ME RIGHT NOW THAT AMENDMENT IS OUT, OR I'M WALKING OUT THAT DOOR AND I'M GONNA START LAUNCHING MISSILES."
00:06:26.887,00:06:29.181,THE AMENDMENT WAS NEVER INTENDED TO STAY IN THE BILL.
00:06:29.264,00:06:31.225,"IT WAS JUST THERE FOR LEVERAGE, THAT'S ALL."
00:06:31.308,00:06:34.686,YOU THREATENED TO CUT FEDERAL FUNDING FROM UNION SCHOOL DISTRICTS?
00:06:34.769,00:06:37.522,"THAT'S NOT A POKER CHIP, FRANK. THAT'S A GODDAMN DIRTY BOMB."
00:06:37.605,00:06:42.903,"LOOK, THE AMENDMENT IS NOT STAYING IN THE BILL."
00:06:42.986,00:06:46.031,I JUST NEED YOU TO WORK WITH ME ON PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
00:06:46.114,00:06:50.202,PERFORMANCE STANDARDS? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?
00:06:50.285,00:06:52.120,YOU AGREED THAT THEY WERE ALREADY OUT! YOU CAN'T JUST PUT THEM BACK IN!
00:06:52.204,00:06:54.956,"- MARTY, LOOK-- - I HAVE A REPUTATION TO UPHOLD!"
00:06:55.040,00:07:00.962,I AM THE ONE THAT MADE THE UNION REPS STAY HERE FOR YOU WHILE YOU WERE IN GAFFNEY PLAYING WITH YOUR FUCKING PEACHOID!
00:07:01.046,00:07:03.924,- MARTY-- - YOU TELL ME RIGHT NOW! IS THAT AMENDMENT IN OR OUT?
00:07:06.843,00:07:09.054,WE JUST HAVE TO FIND IT.
00:07:10.722,00:07:12.557,I TAKE THAT AS A NO.
00:07:15.227,00:07:16.853,OKAY.
00:07:22.692,00:07:25.320,"YOU FUCK ME, I FUCK BACK."
00:07:29.866,00:07:31.243,STAMPER!
00:07:31.326,00:07:33.620,MARTY AND I HAVE A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP.
00:07:33.703,00:07:38.833,"OR USED TO. YOU CAN SEE HE HAS A TEMPER, BUT I CAN USUALLY CUT THROUGH THAT AND REASON WITH HIM."
00:07:38.917,00:07:41.502,"BUT I MAY HAVE PUSHED HIM TOO FAR, WHICH IS WORRISOME."
00:07:41.586,00:07:43.755,FRIENDS MAKE THE WORST ENEMIES.
00:07:45.548,00:07:47.634,- HOW'D IT GO? - WHAT DID YOU HEAR?
00:07:47.717,00:07:51.263,"- A LOT OF FUCKS. - WELL, THAT PRETTY MUCH SAYS IT."
00:07:51.346,00:07:52.973,LET'S THINK THIS THROUGH.
00:07:53.056,00:07:55.058,WE'VE GOT THE D.N.C. LEADERSHIP MEETING.
00:07:55.142,00:07:57.936,"- WHAT? - I'D SAY YOU COULD SKIP IT, BUT BIRCH JUST DUMPED IT ON US."
00:07:58.019,00:08:00.314,- WHEN? - IT'S HERE IN 12 MINUTES.
00:08:00.397,00:08:02.316,WHY HERE AND NOT THE D.N.C. HEADQUARTERS?
00:08:02.399,00:08:03.900,THE D.N.C. IS DOING RENOVATIONS.
00:08:03.984,00:08:05.444,THEY'RE GONNA BE GREEN ENERGY EFFICIENT.
00:08:05.526,00:08:08.822,"OH, THAT'S A CHARMING USE OF PARTY FUNDS."
00:08:11.283,00:08:12.700,IT'S COOL.
00:08:12.784,00:08:14.702,"NOT EXACTLY THE HERALD, IS IT?"
00:08:14.786,00:08:16.621,HAVE YOU BEEN TO THOSE OFFICES?
00:08:16.704,00:08:19.874,YES. WRIST-SLITTING WAS IN ORDER.
00:08:19.958,00:08:22.752,"SO, WHO ELSE IS COURTING YOU?"
00:08:22.836,00:08:25.630,- A FEW PEOPLE. - YOU MEAN EVERYONE.
00:08:25.713,00:08:28.008,THERE WERE A LOT OF E-MAILS THIS MORNING.
00:08:28.091,00:08:30.093,THAT'S NOT SURPRISING. YOU'RE HAVING A MOMENT.
00:08:30.177,00:08:32.053,PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED. I'M ONE OF THEM.
00:08:32.137,00:08:35.598,"BUT IF EIGHT MINUTES PASSES ON ANYTHING, I GET BORED."
00:08:35.682,00:08:38.352,"IN EIGHT MINUTES, I CAN BE BORED WITH YOU, UNLESS YOU KEEP ME INTERESTED."
00:08:38.435,00:08:41.146,I THINK YOU CAN.
00:08:41.229,00:08:44.941,AND I THINK THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU TO KEEP THE REST OF THE WORLD INTERESTED TOO.
00:08:45.025,00:08:46.943,IT'S YOUR CALL. I WON'T CHASE YOU.
00:08:47.027,00:08:48.362,I'M DEFINITELY TEMPTED.
00:08:48.445,00:08:50.613,TAKE AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO LOOK AROUND.
00:08:50.697,00:08:53.783,E-MAIL ME YOUR FIGURE. I'LL CALL YOU BACK WITH A COUNTER.
00:08:58.413,00:09:03.335,"THIS IS OUR TOP PRIORITY. OHIO, FLORIDA, AND PENNSYLVANIA."
00:09:03.418,00:09:06.004,"WE NEED ALL OF THEM, OR WALKER'S A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT."
00:09:06.087,00:09:08.298,PENNSYLVANIA IS WHY HE PICKED MATTHEWS AS A RUNNING MATE.
00:09:08.382,00:09:10.091,BUT NOW WE HAVE TO FIND A REPLACEMENT.
00:09:10.175,00:09:12.427,THE SPECIAL ELECTION IS THIS NOVEMBER.
00:09:12.511,00:09:15.222,"PATRICIA WHITTAKER, D.N.C. CHAIR."
00:09:15.305,00:09:19.726,A RARE EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHOSE HEAD IS IN THE GAME INSTEAD OF UP THEIR BACKSIDE.
00:09:24.272,00:09:26.233,THIS ALSO AFFECTS THE HOUSE.
00:09:26.316,00:09:28.402,THE NEW GOVERNOR WILL OVERSEE REDISTRICTING.
00:09:28.485,00:09:31.196,"WE LOSE SEATS HERE, THAT MEANS WE COULD LOSE OUR MAJORITY IN WASHINGTON."
00:09:31.279,00:09:34.533,"WELL, THE R.N.C. IS BACKING JACK SWOFFORD, EX-MAYOR OF PITTSBURGH."
00:09:34.615,00:09:38.161,HE'S GOT STATEWIDE NAME RECOGNITION AND CAMPAIGN MACHINERY IN PLACE.
00:09:38.245,00:09:41.248,"IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS, AND WE DON'T HAVE DICK."
00:09:41.331,00:09:43.166,WHAT ABOUT THE A.G.? BEN PLUCKETT?
00:09:45.877,00:09:49.089,WHICH HE'LL LOSE BECAUSE HE BOTCHED A SEX OFFENDER STING LAST YEAR.
00:09:49.172,00:09:51.383,- THERE'S ALWAYS McHOLLAND. - HE'S 78.
00:09:51.466,00:09:53.760,"WHEN'S THE LAST TIME HE HELD OFFICE, WHEN CARTER WAS PRESIDENT?"
00:09:55.720,00:09:57.638,"HE HAS DIGNITY, HE HAS GRAVITAS."
00:09:57.722,00:10:02.310,"IF YOU NEED SOMEONE TO FILL MATTHEWS' SHOES-- YOU CAN'T FILL JIM MATTHEWS' SHOES, SO WE SHOULDN'T EVEN TRY."
00:10:05.855,00:10:09.692,LET'S GO THROUGH ALL THE SITTING CONGRESSMEN ONE BY ONE AND SEE IF ANYBODY STICKS OUT FROM THE CROWD.
00:10:13.321,00:10:15.323,"PENNSYLVANIA'S FIRST DISTRICT, PETER RUSSO."
00:10:15.407,00:10:18.326,"CROSS HIM OFF. HE'S NO GOOD. NO EXPERIENCE, NO CHOPS."
00:10:24.499,00:10:26.543,- AND CAROLINE? - SHE'S GOOD.
00:10:26.626,00:10:28.545,- AND THE BOYS? - ALL FUCKING FOUR OF 'EM?
00:10:30.838,00:10:33.467,YOU GOT ANY PICTURES ON YOUR PHONE?
00:10:33.550,00:10:35.969,"COME ON. LET'S CUT THE SHIT, PETE, WILL YA?"
00:10:36.052,00:10:37.471,WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT THE SHIPYARD?
00:10:40.765,00:10:44.018,BRAC HAD THEIR HEARING. THEY SLATED IT FOR CLOSING.
00:10:44.102,00:10:46.229,"YEAH, AND WHY DIDN'T YOU TESTIFY?"
00:10:46.313,00:10:48.565,"WE'RE TALKING 12,000 JOBS HERE."
00:10:48.648,00:10:51.109,"MY HANDS WERE TIED, PAUL. PEOPLE WANTED IT CLOSED."
00:10:51.192,00:10:53.027,- I WAS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE. - FROM WHO?
00:10:53.111,00:10:55.280,PEOPLE HIGH UP THE FOOD CHAIN.
00:10:55.363,00:10:57.907,- THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO. - THAT'S BULLSHIT!
00:10:57.991,00:10:59.909,YOU GO BACK TO BRAC. YOU TALK TO THE D.O.D.
00:10:59.993,00:11:02.078,YOU TALK TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY. YOU DO SOMETHING.
00:11:02.162,00:11:03.622,IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
00:11:03.704,00:11:06.249,- OKAY. WHY NOT? - I TOLD YOU. IT'S POLITICAL.
00:11:06.333,00:11:09.710,SO I'M SUPPOSED TO GO BACK TO THE SHIPBUILDERS' ASSOCIATION AND SAY WHAT NOW EXACTLY?
00:11:09.794,00:11:12.506,THAT THEY'RE OUT OF WORK BECAUSE PETE RUSSO'S PLAYING POLITICS?
00:11:14.215,00:11:16.301,"I MEAN, JESUS, PETE."
00:11:16.384,00:11:20.180,WE'RE THE ONES WHO GOT YOU FUCKING ELECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
00:11:20.263,00:11:22.807,NOW YOU'RE GONNA TURN YOUR BACK ON US?
00:11:22.890,00:11:24.725,YOU SHOULD GO.
00:11:33.776,00:11:36.571,"HEY, I'M FUCKING TALKING TO YOU!"
00:11:38.697,00:11:40.741,I THOUGHT WE GREW UP TOGETHER.
00:11:40.825,00:11:48.833,BUT THIS GUY SITTING BEHIND HIS BIG DESK-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THE FUCK HE IS.
00:11:48.916,00:11:53.588,WHERE'S THE PETE RUSSO WHO KNEW HOW TO THROW A PUNCH WHEN HIS BACK WAS AGAINST THE WALL?
00:11:53.672,00:11:57.008,THAT GUY WAS MY FRIEND.
00:12:10.689,00:12:13.567,"DOESN'T NEED ALL OF THEM. 15, 20 STATES, THAT'S ALL."
00:12:13.650,00:12:15.818,THE A.F.T. AND THE N.E.A. CAN'T AGREE ON ANYTHING.
00:12:15.902,00:12:17.736,YOU UNDERESTIMATE MARTY SPINELLA.
00:12:19.780,00:12:22.450,SO WHICH ONE DO WE TARGET?
00:12:22.534,00:12:24.578,WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE WITH THE N.E.A.
00:12:24.661,00:12:26.954,YOU THINK CHUCK SLOAN WILL BITE?
00:12:27.038,00:12:29.666,COOPERATE-- WE'LL GIVE YOUR PEOPLE PROTECTION AND A PLACE AT THE BANQUET.
00:12:29.748,00:12:32.335,"FIGHT US, WE BREAK YOU. HE'LL BITE. GET HIM ON THE PHONE."
00:12:32.419,00:12:34.045,IT'S AFTER 2:00.
00:12:34.128,00:12:38.633,SPINELLA IS POTENTIALLY MOBILIZING THE LARGEST TEACHERS' STRIKE IN UNITED STATES HISTORY.
00:12:42.845,00:12:44.723,I'M SORRY. ARE WE BEING TOO LOUD?
00:12:44.805,00:12:47.141,A LITTLE.
00:12:48.685,00:12:50.604,- WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON? - THE GALA.
00:12:50.687,00:12:53.481,THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO.
00:12:53.565,00:12:56.276,- DID NANCY SEND YOU MY LIST? - SHE DID.
00:12:56.359,00:12:58.819,- WHAT'D YOU THINK? - IT'S A GOOD LIST.
00:12:58.903,00:13:00.947,THANKS FOR INVITING THEM.
00:13:03.824,00:13:05.452,IS SOMETHING WRONG?
00:13:07.537,00:13:10.540,IT'S STILL NOT ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT REMY BROUGHT TO THE TABLE.
00:13:12.041,00:13:14.586,"SANCORP OFFERED 1.5 MILLION, FRANCIS."
00:13:14.669,00:13:18.047,"I'M ADDING UP THE NUMBERS, AND WE'RE ONLY AT HALF A MILLION."
00:13:18.131,00:13:20.300,- I GOT CHUCK ON THE PHONE. - IN A MINUTE.
00:13:20.383,00:13:23.511,- I CAN MAKE MORE CALLS. - ENOUGH TO RAISE A MILLION-FIVE?
00:13:27.515,00:13:28.767,I'M GOING TO BED.
00:13:30.518,00:13:32.437,DON'T MOVE ANY OF THIS AROUND.
00:13:32.520,00:13:36.691,"CLAIRE, WE MADE THE DECISION TO TURN REMY DOWN."
00:13:36.775,00:13:39.527,NO ONE FORCED YOU. I THOUGHT WE WERE OKAY ON THIS.
00:13:39.611,00:13:42.155,YOU'RE RIGHT.
00:13:42.238,00:13:44.407,"GOOD NIGHT, FRANCIS."
00:14:31.954,00:14:40.672,"HI, ADAM. IT'S ME. I KNOW IT'S LATE, BUT... WELL, I WAS REALLY JUST CALLING TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE PHOTOGRAPHS."
00:14:40.755,00:14:43.633,I'M SURE THEY'RE GONNA BE A BIG HIT AT THE AUCTION.
00:14:45.259,00:14:47.136,I HOPE YOU'RE WELL.
00:14:51.516,00:14:54.644,I'M SURE THEY'RE GONNA BE A BIG HIT AT THE AUCTION.
00:14:55.978,00:14:58.105,I HOPE YOU'RE WELL.
00:15:15.874,00:15:17.709,"RIGHT THIS WAY, MR. HAMMERSCHMIDT."
00:15:22.589,00:15:23.840,HE'S HERE.
00:15:25.842,00:15:28.511,"GOOD AFTERNOON, TOM."
00:15:33.182,00:15:34.517,LEGAL?
00:15:34.601,00:15:37.437,"DID YOU SAY IT, OR DIDN'T YOU?"
00:15:39.313,00:15:43.735,"TO YOU, AND TO ANYONE WHO ASKS, YES, I DID."
00:15:46.153,00:15:47.988,DO WE REALLY NEED THEM?
00:15:48.072,00:15:49.990,NOT UNLESS I SHOULD EXPECT A FIGHT.
00:15:50.074,00:15:51.618,YOU SHOULDN'T.
00:15:51.701,00:15:53.953,GIVE US A FEW MOMENTS.
00:16:06.173,00:16:10.219,"IT'S NOT WHAT YOU CALLED HER, IT'S THAT YOU LET HER LEAVE THE BUILDING."
00:16:10.303,00:16:12.722,"I KNOW HOW TO RUN A PAPER, MARGARET."
00:16:12.806,00:16:16.434,WHAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IS RUN A PAPER STAFFED WITH PEOPLE I CAN'T CONTROL.
00:16:16.517,00:16:18.519,WAS SHE REALLY OUT OF CONTROL?
00:16:18.603,00:16:21.940,"TO MY UNDERSTANDING, SHE SIMPLY TURNED DOWN A NEW POSITION."
00:16:22.064,00:16:24.692,IT'S HER ATTITUDE. IT'S THE WAY SHE TURNED IT DOWN.
00:16:24.776,00:16:27.153,DID YOU THINK TO ASK HER WHAT SHE'D RATHER DO INSTEAD?
00:16:32.533,00:16:36.329,"AND IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER THAT YOU DON'T, YES, IT IS YOUR JOB."
00:16:36.412,00:16:37.831,"WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS, TOM."
00:16:37.914,00:16:40.040,THE PAPER'S OPERATING AT A LOSS.
00:16:40.124,00:16:41.417,WE NEED PEOPLE LIKE ZOE.
00:16:41.501,00:16:45.171,"I'M VERY AWARE OF HOW MUCH WE'RE HURTING, MARGARET."
00:16:45.254,00:16:47.381,"STAFF REDUCTIONS, DIP IN CIRCULATION."
00:16:47.465,00:16:52.303,"EACH ONE OF THOSE FACES AND EVERY SUBSCRIBER WE LOSE, THEY KEEP ME AWAKE AT NIGHT."
00:16:52.386,00:16:55.598,"NOW, I WON'T ARGUE THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THINGS."
00:16:55.682,00:17:09.570,"IT'S NEITHER MY PLACE NOR MY AREA OF EXPERTISE, BUT KNOW THIS-- ZOE BARNES, TWITTER, BLOGS, ENRICHED MEDIA, THEY'RE ALL SURFACE."
00:17:09.654,00:17:11.364,THEY'RE FADS.
00:17:11.447,00:17:16.619,"THEY AREN'T THE FOUNDATION THIS PAPER WAS BUILT ON, AND THEY AREN'T WHAT WILL KEEP IT ALIVE."
00:17:16.703,00:17:21.207,WE HAVE A CORE READERSHIP THAT THIRSTS FOR HARD NEWS.
00:17:21.290,00:17:27.213,THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE I WORK 80 HOURS A WEEK FOR.
00:17:27.296,00:17:30.424,AND I WON'T BE DISTRACTED BY WHAT'S FASHIONABLE.
00:17:39.433,00:17:41.394,THAT'S YOUR RESIGNATION LETTER.
00:17:41.477,00:17:44.814,HAND IT TO THE LAWYERS ON THE WAY OUT.
00:17:49.068,00:17:52.154,"NO, NO, STAY. IT'LL BE QUICK."
00:17:52.238,00:17:53.948,WE'LL GET A DRINK.
00:17:58.411,00:18:00.246,WE'RE GOING TO LAUNCH RIGHT HERE IN WASHINGTON.
00:18:00.329,00:18:04.834,WE'LL SEE HOW CONGRESS LIKES IT WHEN THE STREETS ARE TEEMING WITH UNSUPERVISED SCHOOL KIDS.
00:18:04.918,00:18:07.378,THEN WE'LL PHASE OUT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.
00:18:07.461,00:18:08.713,EVERYBODY HOLD ON FOR ONE MINUTE.
00:18:08.796,00:18:09.797,WHAT'S UP?
00:18:09.881,00:18:11.465,THE N.E.A. IS OUT.
00:18:11.549,00:18:12.550,- HANG ON. - WHAT?
00:18:12.633,00:18:13.843,THEY PULLED OUT.
00:18:13.927,00:18:14.928,WHY?
00:18:15.011,00:18:18.180,HE WOULDN'T SAY.
00:18:18.264,00:18:19.849,HOLD ON FOR ONE MORE MINUTE.
00:18:19.933,00:18:21.517,CHUCK SLOAN-- GET HIM ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW.
00:18:21.601,00:18:22.810,I'VE GOT HIM RIGHT HERE.
00:18:22.894,00:18:24.062,- IS HE MUTED? - YES.
00:18:29.567,00:18:31.360,"HEY, CHUCK. IT'S MARTY."
00:18:31.444,00:18:34.447,"LISTEN, YOU CAN'T DO THIS."
00:18:34.530,00:18:39.911,"IF WE DON'T STAY UNITED NOW, WE DON'T HAVE A-- YOU HIRED ME TO REPRESENT YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHT?"
00:18:39.994,00:18:48.419,HOW CAN I POSSIBLY LOBBY FOR THE TEACHERS WHEN CONGRESS SEES US SPLINTERING BEFORE WE EVEN PUT UP A UNITE-- ALL RIGHT.
00:18:49.921,00:18:51.839,DID UNDERWOOD GET TO YOU?
00:18:56.886,00:18:58.638,"WAIT-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA, CHUCK, CH-CH-CHUCK?"

00:19:15.780,00:19:17.991,- GIVE ME A NAME. - NO NAME.
00:19:18.074,00:19:19.784,WHAT DID THIS PERSON DO WRONG?
00:19:19.867,00:19:21.243,LIE TO ME.
00:19:21.327,00:19:23.412,HOW WILL YOU PUNISH HIM?
00:19:23.496,00:19:25.123,WHAT MAKES YOU THINK IT'S A HIM?
00:19:27.583,00:19:31.462,HOLD ON. I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.
00:19:31.545,00:19:32.755,WHERE ARE YOU?

00:19:40.096,00:19:43.390,YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME A NEW ONE OF THESE EVERY WEEK?
00:19:43.474,00:19:48.521,"WELL, I-- I CAN'T CONTINUE TO-- NOT WITHOUT PROTECTION."
00:19:48.604,00:19:50.982,NOBODY TELLS ME WHEN TO WORK AND WHEN TO PLAY.
00:19:51.065,00:19:53.567,"I'M NOT BEING UNREASONABLE, ZOE."
00:19:53.651,00:19:56.362,"IF YOU CAN'T TRUST ME, WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS AT ALL."
00:20:01.200,00:20:03.786,"WELL, THEN, HOW DO WE ESTABLISH OUR TRUST?"
00:20:03.870,00:20:05.830,I HAVE BEEN VERY DISCREET.
00:20:05.913,00:20:10.877,"OH, PROFESSIONAL DISCRETION, YES, BUT THIS IS NEW TERRITORY."
00:20:15.089,00:20:17.050,YOU HAVE A CAMERA ON YOUR PHONE.
00:20:24.431,00:20:27.101,PICTURES...
00:20:27.185,00:20:29.729,THE KIND I WOULDN'T WANT MY FATHER TO SEE.
00:20:34.108,00:20:35.860,"WELL, I'M GOING TO NEED MORE THAN THAT."
00:21:01.594,00:21:03.096,LIE BACK.
00:21:10.686,00:21:12.146,USE YOUR IMAGINATION.
00:21:21.363,00:21:23.950,"- WE CHECKED ALREADY, DAD. - OH, DID YOU?"
00:21:24.033,00:21:26.077,THOSE ARE MY PINK NIKES ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER?
00:21:26.160,00:21:28.996,"AND YOU, AUTOBOT, WHAT IS OPTIMUS PRIME DOING UNDER MY BED?"
00:21:29.080,00:21:33.375,HE BETTER TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO YOUR BACKPACK BEFORE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE TOMORROW.
00:21:36.879,00:21:38.047,"HEY, DAD?"
00:21:38.131,00:21:40.800,IS CHRISTINA COMING BACK?
00:21:40.883,00:21:43.844,"UM, I DON'T THINK SO, BUDDY. NO."
00:21:43.928,00:21:46.013,"OH, I LIKED HER."
00:21:46.097,00:21:48.015,"ME, TOO. SHE'S COOL."
00:21:48.099,00:21:50.935,"YEAH, SHE IS COOL."
00:21:51.018,00:21:57.316,"AND YOU GUYS GOTTA BRUSH YOUR TEETH AND THEN CHECK THE ROOMS AGAIN, AND THEN IT'S TIME FOR BED."
00:21:57.399,00:21:58.901,"GOT IT, PUMPKINS?"
00:21:58.985,00:22:02.113,"DAD, YOU KNOW I HATE IT WHEN YOU CALL US PUMPKINS."
00:22:02.196,00:22:04.824,GO BEFORE I TURN YOU INTO A PIE.
00:22:21.548,00:22:23.134,HE'S A DRUNK.
00:22:23.217,00:22:25.552,"HE IS AT THE MOMENT, A VERY FUNCTIONAL ONE."
00:22:25.636,00:22:27.180,IMAGINE IF HE WAS SOBER.
00:22:27.263,00:22:30.599,"EVEN SO, YOU RUN HIM FOR GOVERNOR, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIG INTO HIS PAST."
00:22:30.683,00:22:33.186,"WELL, WE TURN THAT INTO AN ASSET, NOT A LIABILITY."
00:22:33.269,00:22:36.438,HERE'S WHO I WAS. HERE'S WHO I AM NOW.
00:22:36.522,00:22:39.566,YOU SAW HOW THEY DISMISSED HIM IN THREE SECONDS AT THE LEADERSHIP MEETING.
00:22:39.650,00:22:43.529,"PATTY WHITTAKER IS VERY OPEN-MINDED, AND I AM VERY PERSUASIVE."
00:22:46.240,00:22:47.992,YOU THINK RUSSO EVEN WANTS IT?
00:22:48.075,00:22:52.538,ANY KID WHO'S MADE IT FROM THE STREETS OF SOUTH PHILLY TO THE CAPITOL ROTUNDA IS AMBITIOUS.
00:22:52.621,00:22:58.044,"WE JUST NEED TO TAP INTO THAT, SURROUND HIM WITH THE BEST PEOPLE AND THEN BUILD THE MACHINE AND PUSH THE GO BUTTON."
00:22:58.127,00:22:59.545,SO YOU THINK HE COULD WIN.
00:23:01.005,00:23:02.589,I THINK HE CAN BE A CONTENDER.
00:23:07.720,00:23:09.429,WHAT DO WE GAIN BY IT?
00:23:09.513,00:23:13.642,ISN'T IT BETTER TO BE HOLDING THE REINS IN THIS RACE THAN WATCHING FROM THE STANDS?
00:23:13.726,00:23:14.935,YOU WIFE IS ON THE PHONE.
00:23:15.019,00:23:17.063,PUT HER THROUGH IN HERE.
00:23:17.146,00:23:21.399,"I UNDERSTAND THAT PENNSYLVANIA'S IMPORTANT FOR REDISTRICTING-- NO, NO, NO, THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THIS RACE, DOUG."
00:23:21.483,00:23:23.319,EXPAND YOUR THINKING.
00:23:23.401,00:23:28.157,WHO ELSE IS FROM PENNSYLVANIA?
00:23:28.241,00:23:29.700,"NO, NO, NO, NOT IN CONGRESS."
00:23:29.783,00:23:31.869,THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
00:23:33.871,00:23:34.997,THE VICE PRESIDENT.
00:23:37.333,00:23:46.384,"HELLO, MY DEAR. NANCY HAD MY TUX DRY-CLEANED SO I WON'T EMBARRASS-- I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW. I'LL COME GET YOU."
00:23:46.466,00:23:47.467,I'VE GOT TO GO.
00:23:47.551,00:23:48.677,WHAT'S GOING ON?
00:23:48.761,00:23:50.179,"THE HOTEL, FOR TONIGHT'S GALA."
00:23:50.263,00:23:56.352,THEY REFUSED TO LET CLAIRE INTO THE BALLROOM BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE UNION.
00:23:56.434,00:23:57.728,SPINELLA.
00:23:57.811,00:24:00.856,"YEAH, HE CAN GO AFTER ME ALL HE WANTS, BUT TO GO AFTER MY WIFE?"
00:24:00.940,00:24:03.276,NO CLASS. MEET ME AT THE COTESWORTH.
00:24:03.359,00:24:04.777,YOU GOT IT.
00:24:06.695,00:24:08.446,WHY CAN'T WE JUST MOVE IT TO ANOTHER PLACE?
00:24:08.530,00:24:09.990,I LOOKED INTO THAT. EVERYTHING'S BOOKED.
00:24:10.074,00:24:11.909,YOU HAVE TO RESERVE THESE THINGS WEEKS IN ADVANCE.
00:24:11.992,00:24:14.370,I'VE GOT STAMPER ONLINE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER VENUE SOMEWHERE.
00:24:14.452,00:24:16.747,"FRANCIS, THE DELIVERY TRUCKS ARE ALREADY AT THE COTESWORTH."
00:24:16.830,00:24:20.667,I CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE SHOWING UP AT A DIFFERENT PLACE IN CASE THEY DON'T GET THE EMAIL.
00:24:20.751,00:24:22.253,THIS IS MY FAULT. I FEEL AWFUL.
00:24:22.336,00:24:23.587,THERE'S A HALF A MILLION ON THE LINE HERE.
00:24:23.670,00:24:25.463,I REALIZE THAT.
00:24:25.547,00:24:28.759,AND I CAN'T KEEP HAVING MY WORK TAKE THESE HITS ON BEHALF OF YOURS.
00:24:28.842,00:24:30.636,IT'S MORE THAN JUST AN INCONVENIENCE.
00:24:30.719,00:24:32.679,I KNOW. WE'LL SOLVE IT.
00:24:42.522,00:24:44.942,YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEND ME THINGS BEFORE YOU POST.
00:24:45.025,00:24:46.777,"OH, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK."
00:24:46.860,00:24:50.114,THE GOAL HERE IS FOR EVERYONE TO POST THINGS FASTER THAN I HAVE A CHANCE TO READ THEM.
00:24:50.197,00:24:52.866,"IF YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH THE ARTICLE, JUST PUT IT UP."
00:24:52.950,00:24:55.328,- OKAY. - ARE YOU SATISFIED?
00:24:55.411,00:24:56.578,I THINK SO.
00:24:56.662,00:24:58.456,"OKAY, YOU ARE OR YOU AREN'T."
00:24:58.538,00:25:00.749,WHATEVER HOOPS THE HERALD MADE YOU JUMP THROUGH...
00:25:00.833,00:25:02.709,- I KNOW. - ...LET THEM GO.
00:25:02.793,00:25:07.423,"IT'S OKAY TO BE OPINIONATED, ZOE, AND IT'S OKAY TO GO OUTSIDE AND GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY."
00:25:07.505,00:25:10.217,YOU'RE NO LONGER TIED TO A DESK.
00:25:10.301,00:25:11.509,"OR THAT PILLOW, FOR THAT MATTER."
00:25:11.593,00:25:13.012,I'M NOT GOING TO POST IT.
00:25:13.095,00:25:14.763,MIDTERM PREDICTIONS-- THEY'RE NOT NEWS.
00:25:14.847,00:25:15.848,THEY'RE BULLSHIT.
00:25:15.931,00:25:17.224,"WELL, I AGREE."
00:25:18.642,00:25:19.935,I CAN DO BETTER.
00:25:20.019,00:25:21.645,I THINK YOU CAN.
00:25:21.728,00:25:24.231,FEEL FREE TO BLOW MY MIND.
00:25:35.909,00:25:39.788,I'VE GOT 300 GUESTS-- YOU SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH MY WIFE.
00:25:39.872,00:25:45.378,WE'LL REFUND YOUR WIFE'S ORGANIZATION AND PAY FOR WHATEVER THE COSTS OF MOVING THE EVENT TO A MORE APPROPRIATE VENUE.
00:25:45.461,00:25:47.963,AND WE WOULD HAVE TO REFUND A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN DONATIONS.
00:25:48.047,00:25:49.715,"CAN YOU PAY FOR THAT, TOO?"
00:25:49.798,00:25:51.800,BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE THERE'S CAUSE FOR DAMAGES HERE.
00:25:51.884,00:25:54.094,"I TRULY APOLOGIZE, SIR."
00:25:54.178,00:25:55.553,WHO'S YOUR BOSS?
00:25:55.637,00:25:58.891,"I SPOKE WITH THE OWNERS, AND THEY AUTHORIZED ME TO DO WHAT I THINK IS BEST."
00:25:58.974,00:26:03.479,AND DO THEY REALIZE THAT THEY ARE SHUTTING THE DOOR ON 41 MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS?
00:26:03.561,00:26:05.814,"YES, SIR, THEY DO."
00:26:05.898,00:26:08.192,I HAD TO MAKE A VERY HARD JUDGMENT CALL.
00:26:08.275,00:26:10.486,"WELL, I SERIOUSLY QUESTION YOUR JUDGMENT."
00:26:10.568,00:26:12.654,"YOU KNOW, WORD TRAVELS FAST IN THIS TOWN."
00:26:12.738,00:26:15.157,ALL THOSE LUNCHEONS AND CONVENTIONS AND DINNERS.
00:26:15.241,00:26:17.743,IT'S GOING TO BE A SHAME TO LOSE ALL THAT WORK. ISN'T IT?
00:26:17.826,00:26:25.125,"CONGRESSMAN, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, BUT IF MY STAFF WALKS OUT, I-- PLEASE UNDERSTAND THE PREDICAMENT I'M IN."
00:26:26.460,00:26:28.045,I KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.
00:26:28.128,00:26:31.257,"HONEY, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LET US HAVE IT INSIDE."
00:26:31.340,00:26:33.633,"WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IT RIGHT HERE ON THEIR FRONT STEPS, PICNIC STYLE."
00:26:33.717,00:26:34.968,WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME?
00:26:35.052,00:26:36.636,I NEED YOUR MANPOWER.
00:26:36.720,00:26:37.721,"YES, SIR, I'M ON IT."
00:26:40.849,00:26:44.478,"OKAY, EVERYBODY, STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING, AND LISTEN UP."
00:26:47.147,00:26:48.566,YEAH.
00:26:48.648,00:26:50.608,"OH, HEY, FRANK."

00:26:56.698,00:26:58.700,- HOW MANY PEOPLE WE TALKING? - JUST 300.
00:26:58.784,00:27:00.744,THE FLORIST IS GOING TO SEND OVER WHATEVER HE HAS.
00:27:00.827,00:27:01.912,GREAT.
00:27:01.995,00:27:03.663,"FRANCIS, WHERE ARE WE WITH FOOD?"
00:27:03.747,00:27:06.708,"I'VE GOT HOT DOGS, PIZZAS, AND SOUL FOOD COMING, MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE."
00:27:08.626,00:27:11.297,"I WANT FOUR BARS, TWO ON EACH LEVEL."
00:27:11.380,00:27:13.966,THE FOOD CAN GO THERE. THE SILENT AUCTION GOES HERE.
00:27:14.049,00:27:16.051,"OH, AND CANCEL THE STRING QUARTET. LET'S GET A DJ."
00:27:16.135,00:27:17.261,"DOUG, HOW ARE WE ON BOOZE?"

00:27:33.986,00:27:36.029,"CONGRESSMAN, PEOPLE KEEP CALLING ABOUT THE SHIPYARDS."
00:27:36.113,00:27:37.281,WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL THEM.
00:27:37.364,00:27:38.574,WE JUST SAY WE'LL GIVE YOU THE MESSAGE.
00:27:38.656,00:27:41.868,"- KEEP SAYING THAT. - HERE THEY ARE, THE MESSAGES AND ALL THE EMAILS WE'VE GOTTEN, TOO."

00:28:27.705,00:28:33.587,"YOU KNOW, I'M NO EXPERT IN FIRE CODE, BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT LOCKING YOUR GUESTS IN IS A BIGGER VIOLATION THAN HAVING THEM WALK AROUND US."
00:28:33.671,00:28:36.131,THIS IS TRESPASSING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
00:28:36.215,00:28:37.383,YOU'RE BREAKING THE LAW.

00:47:04.614,00:47:06.991,ASPIRIN. GO AHEAD.
00:47:13.205,00:47:14.831,I SAID NO. I STUCK UP FOR YOU.
00:47:14.915,00:47:17.918,"I SAID, PETER RUSSO, HE'S GOT POTENTIAL."
00:47:18.002,00:47:22.173,HE'S YOUNG. HE'S CAPABLE. HE'S GOING PLACES.
00:47:22.256,00:47:25.092,I MADE THEM KEEP YOU IN CONTENTION.
00:47:25.176,00:47:28.262,YOU'RE STILL ON THAT LIST.
00:47:28.346,00:47:41.275,"YOU SHOW UP AT MY HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, DRUNK, TO WHINE, TO TRY TO SHIFT THE BLAME ON ME INSTEAD OF TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR OWN ACTIONS."
00:47:41.359,00:47:44.028,MAYBE THEY WERE RIGHT IN THAT MEETING.
00:47:44.111,00:47:47.448,MAYBE YOU ARE WORTHLESS.
00:47:49.450,00:47:56.791,"I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO BELIEVES IN YOU, PETER, BUT MAYBE THAT'S ONE TOO MANY."
00:47:56.873,00:47:59.627,THE HOT WATER WILL OPEN UP YOUR CAPILLARIES.
00:47:59.711,00:48:02.171,THE ASPIRIN YOU JUST TOOK WILL MAKE YOUR BLOOD THINNER.
00:48:02.254,00:48:04.006,"IT'S UP TO YOU, PETER."
00:48:06.175,00:48:11.013,"OH, AND IF YOU DO DECIDE TO TAKE THE COWARD'S WAY OUT, CUT ALONG THE TRACKS, NOT ACROSS THEM."
00:48:11.096,00:48:12.515,THAT'S A ROOKIE MISTAKE.
00:48:32.702,00:48:34.036,MORNING.
00:48:34.119,00:48:36.831,MORNING.
00:48:36.913,00:48:38.123,YOU NEED A LIFT TO THE HILL?
00:48:39.916,00:48:41.711,"NO, NO, WE'LL DROP YOU."
00:48:42.712,00:48:44.422,WANT SOME COFFEE?
00:48:56.434,00:48:57.476,FRANK...
00:48:57.560,00:49:00.020,ONE MONTH.
00:49:00.104,00:49:01.313,HMM?
00:49:01.397,00:49:03.733,ONE MONTH SOBER.
00:49:09.071,00:49:11.532,I CAN GIVE YOU THAT.
00:49:11.616,00:49:14.159,NOT FOR ME. FOR YOU.
00:49:18.581,00:49:20.750,HAS THE SEED BEEN PLANTED?
00:49:20.833,00:49:23.711,ONLY PETER CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
00:49:23.795,00:49:25.880,HE HAS A CHOICE.
00:49:25.962,00:49:29.467,WILL HE WITHER OR WILL HE THRIVE?
00:49:29.550,00:49:32.136,ONLY TIME WILL TELL.
00:00:10.051,00:00:11.679,AND WE'VE GOT MILLIONS OF KIDS STUCK HOME FROM SCHOOL.
00:00:18.644,00:00:25.024,"IT'S COSTING THE COUNTRY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND INSTEAD OF OFFERING SOLUTIONS-- BETWEEN TAKING A STAND AND SITTING ON YOUR HANDS."
00:00:28.779,00:00:31.365,"IS THAT HE STOLE SOUND, CONSERVATIVE IDEAS."
00:00:31.448,00:00:35.243,THE ONLY SMART THING HE'S DONE IS LIFT HIS PLATFORM FROM THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM.
00:00:40.207,00:00:42.584,WHILE OUR APPROVAL RATINGS CONTINUE TO NOSEDIVE?
00:00:42.668,00:00:45.963,SPINELLA AND I WORKED TOGETHER FOR YEARS ON DOZENS OF LABOR-RELATED BILLS.
00:00:46.045,00:00:48.173,- I THOUGHT HE'D BE REASONABLE. - YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT THAT.
00:00:48.256,00:00:51.719,"WELL, I DIDN'T THINK HE'D BE INSANE ENOUGH TO GO ON STRIKE, AND I DIDN'T THINK THE STRIKE WOULD LAST THIS LONG."
00:00:51.802,00:00:53.387,SO YOU'VE BEEN WRONG TWICE ABOUT THIS.
00:00:55.055,00:00:59.184,WE THREATENED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN ORDER TO GET PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND CHARTER FUNDING.
00:00:59.267,00:01:01.269,THAT'S THE DEAL THAT WE MADE. WE TOOK THAT STAND.
00:01:01.353,00:01:03.731,"WE LAY DOWN NOW, WE LOSE IT ALL."
00:01:03.814,00:01:05.733,"THERE'LL BE NO REFORM, JUST AN EMPTY BILL."
00:01:05.816,00:01:09.778,"I UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC, FRANK, BUT WE'RE IN DAMAGE CONTROL NOW."
00:01:09.862,00:01:11.613,WE CAN'T CLOSE ONE WOUND BY OPENING ANOTHER.
00:01:11.697,00:01:13.490,BUT WE'RE THE DEMOCRATS.
00:01:13.574,00:01:15.325,WE'RE THE ONES WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DEFENDING THE TEACHERS.
00:01:15.409,00:01:16.744,"BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS, LINDA."
00:01:16.827,00:01:20.873,YOU CAN'T HAVE THE REFORM YOU WANT AND KEEP THE TEACHERS HAPPY AT THE SAME TIME.
00:01:20.956,00:01:22.123,YOU KNEW THAT WHEN WE STARTED.
00:01:22.207,00:01:25.586,"OKAY, THEN IF WE HAVE TO CHOOSE, WE CHOOSE TO KEEP THE TEACHERS HAPPY."
00:01:25.669,00:01:27.713,"THAT IS A MISTAKE, LINDA. WE'VE ALREADY CROSSED THE RUBICON."
00:01:27.796,00:01:29.924,I'M TELLING YOU THIS-- THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO CHANGE THE BILL.
00:01:30.007,00:01:32.009,WE SHOULD'VE DONE IT THREE WEEKS AGO. WE DIDN'T.
00:01:32.091,00:01:33.427,SO YOU HAVE TO DO IT NOW.
00:01:33.510,00:01:35.554,"GIVE ME MORE TIME, LINDA, PLEASE."
00:01:35.637,00:01:41.309,"IF I CAN BREAK THIS STRIKE AND GET EVERYTHING WE WANT IN THIS BILL, CAN WE AGREE THAT'S PREFERABLE TO FOLDING?"
00:01:41.393,00:01:44.772,OF COURSE. IF WE CAN COUNT ON THAT-- THEN COUNT ON ME FOR JUST ONE MORE WEEK.
00:01:44.855,00:01:47.232,"IF THE STRIKE ISN'T OVER BY THEN, I'LL CHANGE THE BILL."
00:01:47.315,00:01:49.902,- FRANK-- - NO. ONE MORE WEEK. THAT'S ALL.
00:01:53.697,00:01:56.157,THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE POSITION TO BE IN.
00:01:56.241,00:01:59.119,"IF I WATER DOWN THE BILL, THE PRESIDENT WILL STILL SEE ME AS A FAILURE."
00:01:59.202,00:02:02.163,"IF THE STRIKE DOESN'T END IN A WEEK, I FORCED MYSELF INTO A CORNER."
00:02:02.247,00:02:05.542,ONLY TOTAL VICTORY WILL PUT ME BACK IN HIS GOOD GRACES.
00:02:05.626,00:02:09.379,"THE ALTERNATIVE IS EXILE, WHICH WOULD MEAN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS WERE FOR NOTHING."
00:02:09.463,00:02:12.132,I CANNOT ABIDE FALLING BACK TO SQUARE ONE.
00:03:52.149,00:03:54.068,"DOES THE CONGRESSMAN NEED ME, MA'AM?"
00:03:54.151,00:03:56.862,NO. I JUST WAS WONDERING IF YOU WANTED A CUP OF COFFEE.
00:03:56.945,00:03:58.530,I JUST BREWED A FRESH POT.
00:03:58.613,00:04:01.408,"- I'M GOOD, MA'AM. BUT THANKS. - ARE YOU SURE?"
00:04:01.491,00:04:03.827,MY SHIFT'S DONE IN A COUPLE HOURS. I'LL BE FINE.
00:04:03.911,00:04:05.537,NO. COME ON. STRETCH YOUR LEGS.
00:04:05.620,00:04:07.288,I WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.
00:04:11.793,00:04:14.755,WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE YOU JOINED THE LEADERSHIP DETAIL?
00:04:14.838,00:04:16.757,I WAS A COP HERE IN D.C.
00:04:16.840,00:04:19.051,"BEFORE THAT, I WAS IN THE MARINES, MA'AM."
00:04:19.134,00:04:22.179,- THANK YOU. - DID YOU SERVE OVERSEAS?
00:04:22.262,00:04:25.473,"I DID, MA'AM. BAHRAIN, THEN AFGHANISTAN."
00:04:25.557,00:04:28.435,SERVED MOST OF MY SECOND TOUR IN THE KORANGAL VALLEY.
00:04:31.354,00:04:33.899,YOU WANNA KNOW IF I KILLED ANYONE?
00:04:36.443,00:04:39.905,- I GOT A DINNER MEETING WITH BIRCH. - I INVITED HIM IN FOR COFFEE.
00:04:43.117,00:04:46.327,GET DOWN! STAY AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS!
00:04:57.380,00:04:59.340,STOP!
00:05:09.851,00:05:12.020,YOU'LL HAVE SIX OF MY BEST MEN COVERING YOU AROUND THE CLOCK.
00:05:12.104,00:05:16.524,I GUESS I'M WONDERING WHY WE DIDN'T AT LEAST HAVE ONE OF YOUR BEST MEN COVERING US NOW.
00:05:20.695,00:05:24.532,"- I WANT HIM FIRED. - THERE WILL BE A FULL INVESTIGATION, AND WE'LL TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTION."
00:05:24.616,00:05:27.202,STEVE NEVER WOULD'VE LET THIS HAPPEN.
00:05:27.286,00:05:30.831,IS HE BETTER YET? BECAUSE I WOULD FEEL A LOT SAFER IF HE WAS WITH US.
00:05:30.914,00:05:33.500,"UNFORTUNATELY, HE WON'T BE COMING BACK, SIR."
00:05:33.583,00:05:36.628,I THOUGHT HE JUST HAD A GALLBLADDER INFECTION.
00:05:36.711,00:05:38.755,"HE DID, BUT THEY FOUND MORE."
00:05:38.839,00:05:41.216,"HIS PANCREAS, STAGE FOUR."
00:05:41.300,00:05:42.843,"- JESUS. - OH, MY GOD. THAT'S AWFUL."
00:05:42.926,00:05:44.427,HOW MUCH LONGER DOES HE HAVE?
00:05:44.511,00:05:46.345,NOT LONG. A FEW WEEKS.
00:05:46.429,00:05:48.389,AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT HIS WIFE TOLD ME.
00:05:48.473,00:05:51.059,WE HAVE TO GO SEE HIM. CAN YOU GET THE INFORMATION WHERE HE IS?
00:05:51.143,00:05:52.769,OF COURSE. I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET IT RIGHT AWAY.
00:05:52.853,00:05:54.395,"- THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. - THANK YOU."
00:05:54.479,00:05:57.107,YOU'RE WELCOME. GOOD NIGHT.
00:05:57.191,00:05:59.985,"- FRONT DOOR. - YES, SIR."
00:06:00.068,00:06:01.903,YOUR WEAPON.
00:06:06.365,00:06:07.450,YOUR BADGE TOO.
00:06:07.534,00:06:09.786,"AM I SUSPENDED, SIR?"
00:06:09.870,00:06:13.123,"YOU HAD A SUSPECT ON FOOT, AND YOU FIRE YOUR GUN?"
00:06:17.460,00:06:20.421,NOT ONLY DO YOU ABANDON YOUR POST FOR COFFEE...
00:06:20.505,00:06:23.258,YOU COULD'VE KILLED A BYSTANDER.
00:06:23.342,00:06:25.260,THAT SLUG WAS FOUND IN SOMEBODY'S FRONT STOOP.
00:06:25.344,00:06:27.304,WHAT IF IT WENT IN THEIR HOUSE?
00:06:28.805,00:06:30.724,"YOUR BADGE, MEECHUM."
00:06:38.190,00:06:42.527,"I WAS SICK OF WORKING FOR OTHER PEOPLE, AND I KNEW I COULD DO A BETTER JOB THAN MY BOSSES."
00:06:42.610,00:06:44.696,"THEY KEPT TRYING TO SUPPRESS ME, SHUTTING ME OUT."
00:06:44.779,00:06:46.323,"SO I SAID, FUCK IT. I'LL DO IT MY WAY."
00:06:46.405,00:06:49.243,- THEN YOU JUST QUIT? - NOT LIKE YOU DID.
00:06:49.326,00:06:52.453,I SLAVED AWAY UNTIL I LINED UP THE MONEY TO START SLUGLINE.
00:06:52.537,00:06:56.041,"ONCE SLUGLINE GETS BIG ENOUGH, WHAT'S THE PLAN?"
00:06:56.124,00:06:57.792,ARE YOU GONNA SELL IT LIKE ARIANNA?
00:06:57.876,00:06:59.336,PROBABLY. AND THEN WHO KNOWS?
00:06:59.418,00:07:02.381,WHATEVER THE NEXT ADVENTURE IS. MAYBE SHANGHAI.
00:07:02.463,00:07:04.383,SO I SHOULDN'T EXPECT TO HAVE A JOB IN TWO YEARS?
00:07:06.343,00:07:08.762,DO YOU EVER WANNA HAVE ANY JOB FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS?
00:07:10.471,00:07:12.640,WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT'S YOUR BIG PLAN?
00:07:12.724,00:07:15.352,"UH, I DON'T KNOW YET."
00:07:15.435,00:07:17.979,COME ON. SLUGLINE IS JUST A STEPPING STONE FOR YOU.
00:07:20.690,00:07:24.361,- YOU KNOW WHAT? I SHOULD TAKE THIS. - GO. DO YOUR THING.
00:07:24.444,00:07:26.571,HEY. YOU HAVE PROOF SPINELLA WAS BEHIND IT?
00:07:26.654,00:07:35.496,"PUT IT IN CONTEXT. THREE WEEKS INTO A NATIONAL TEACHERS' STRIKE-- AT THE HOME OF FRANCIS UNDERWOOD, WHO HAS LED THE CHARGE ON-- THERE YOU GO. NOW POST THAT BEFORE ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS CALLS A LOCAL 11:00 HACK."
00:07:35.580,00:07:38.750,- WHEN DO I SEE YOU NEXT? - I'M BACKGROUND ON THIS. I'M NOT YOUR SOURCE.
00:07:38.833,00:07:39.960,YOU CAN'T TALK NOW?
00:07:40.043,00:07:41.044,- NO. - WHEN?
00:07:41.128,00:07:42.712,"SOON, WITH BELLS ON."
00:07:42.796,00:07:46.007,"WHAT ABOUT MORE SCHOOL BOOKS, LESS BRICKS?"
00:07:46.091,00:07:49.010,"NAH, IT'S TOO BROAD. WE NEED A BETTER SOUND BITE."
00:07:49.094,00:07:53.223,"SOMETHING SPECIFIC, SOMETHING THAT POINTS THE FINGER DIRECTLY AT SPINELLA."
00:07:53.307,00:07:55.309,- HE'LL DENY ANY INVOLVEMENT. - OF COURSE HE WILL.
00:07:55.392,00:07:58.103,- SO HOW DO WE GET AROUND THAT? - WE SAY HE CAN'T CONTROL HIS TROOPS.
00:07:58.186,00:08:01.315,- THERE'S NO EVIDENCE IT WAS A TEACHER. - WHO ELSE COULD IT BE?
00:08:01.398,00:08:03.858,HE'S GONNA SHIFT BLAME FOR THE STRIKE BACK ON CONGRESS.
00:08:03.942,00:08:09.156,"NO. WE NEED SOMETHING CLEAR, SOMETHING CLEAN, SOMETHING THAT STICKS IN YOUR HEAD."
00:08:09.239,00:08:11.491,TEACHERS NEED A LESSON IN SELF-RESTRAINT.
00:08:11.574,00:08:14.661,NO. YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME. PEOPLE LIKE TEACHERS.
00:08:14.744,00:08:17.414,NO. WE NEED SOMETHING THAT MAKES SPINELLA THE VILLAIN.
00:08:17.497,00:08:20.375,"- HIS LACK OF CONTROL, HIS INABILITY-- - DISORGANIZED LABOR."
00:08:23.544,00:08:26.423,"IT'S DISORGANIZED LABOR, PLAIN AND SIMPLE."
00:08:32.137,00:08:35.265,WE'LL BE BEEFING UP THE SECURITY FOR THE ENTIRE LEADERSHIP.
00:08:35.349,00:08:39.811,AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE MARTY SPINELLA TO KEEP HIS PEOPLE IN LINE.
00:08:39.894,00:08:42.647,THIS IS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE DISORGANIZED LABOR.
00:08:45.233,00:08:53.450,"WHETHER MR. SPINELLA IS BEHIND THIS OR NOT, HE MIGHT WANNA TONE DOWN THE RHETORIC BEFORE DISORGANIZED LABOR TURNS INTO ORGANIZED CRIME."
00:08:53.533,00:08:56.995,NO ONE CAN PROVE ANYTHING. SO THAT'S THE MOST COGENT RESPONSE.
00:08:57.078,00:08:59.956,"WELL, GO ON TV AND SAY THAT. YOU DEPLORE VIOLENCE IN ANY FORM."
00:09:00.040,00:09:01.875,IT'S CONGRESS THAT SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
00:09:01.958,00:09:04.169,I DON'T WANT TO DEGENERATE TO FRANK'S LEVEL.
00:09:04.252,00:09:07.297,WE NEED TO KILL THIS BRICK THING. IT'S DISTRACTING PEOPLE FROM THE ISSUES.
00:09:10.342,00:09:12.635,NO. THIS STORY IS GETTING TRACTION.
00:09:12.719,00:09:14.346,SUPPORT FOR THE STRIKE IS DIPPING.
00:09:14.429,00:09:16.597,SO IS THE PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATINGS.
00:09:16.681,00:09:18.766,"BUT HE GETS TO STAY IN THE OVAL OFFICE ANOTHER THREE YEARS, NO MATTER WHAT."
00:09:18.850,00:09:20.394,WE CAN'T AFFORD ANOTHER THREE WEEKS.
00:09:20.477,00:09:23.604,"WHEN I TOLD THE UNIONS TO STRIKE, I TOLD THEM TO PREPARE FOR THE LONG HAUL."
00:09:23.688,00:09:26.024,"ALL RIGHT? THEIR ACCOUNTS DRY UP, WE KEEP GOING."
00:09:26.107,00:09:29.444,WE FIGURE IT OUT. I AM NOT GOING TO BLINK OVER SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
00:09:29.528,00:09:33.907,"FINE. BUT IF WE LOSE THE PUBLIC RELATIONS BATTLE, NONE OF THAT DOES US ANY GOOD."
00:09:33.990,00:09:36.159,FRANK WANTS US ON THE DEFENSIVE.
00:09:36.243,00:09:38.286,I THINK THIS STORY IS GOING TO BLOW OVER.
00:09:38.370,00:09:40.288,"IF I'M WRONG, WE'LL REEVALUATE."
00:09:40.372,00:09:44.876,BUT I WANNA GIVE IT ANOTHER DAY OR TWO FIRST. OKAY?
00:10:15.574,00:10:17.325,"HI, ADAM."
00:10:17.409,00:10:20.495,YOU ALL RIGHT? I SAW THE NEWS.
00:10:20.579,00:10:22.205,"YES, I'M FINE."
00:10:22.289,00:10:25.584,THAT'S GOTTA RATTLE THE NERVES-- A BRICK COMING THROUGH THE WINDOW.
00:10:25.666,00:10:27.752,"IT DID, SOME."
00:10:29.379,00:10:31.298,SO ARE YOU STAYING IN THE HOUSE?
00:10:31.381,00:10:35.302,"WE'VE GOT EXTRA SECURITY NOW, SO..."
00:10:35.385,00:10:40.974,"WELL, UM, IT MADE ME THINK OF YOU, SO I FIGURED I'D JUST CHECK IN."
00:10:42.142,00:10:44.269,I APPRECIATE THAT.
00:10:44.352,00:10:48.231,"WE STILL HAVEN'T TALKED, HAVE WE?"
00:10:48.315,00:10:50.400,- THERE'S NO NEED TO. - I THINK WE SHOULD.
00:10:50.484,00:10:52.277,HERE'S HOW I SEE IT.
00:10:52.360,00:10:55.447,YOU ASKED ME TO COME DOWN. I DID.
00:10:59.784,00:11:02.787,PROBABLY VERY SIMILAR IDEAS.
00:11:02.870,00:11:04.998,BUT THEN YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.
00:11:05.081,00:11:07.292,SO BE IT.
00:11:07.375,00:11:11.212,THERE'S NO REASON WE CAN'T BE IN TOUCH OR REMAIN FRIENDS.
00:11:12.755,00:11:15.300,"LET'S NOT FOOL OURSELVES, ADAM."
00:11:15.383,00:11:16.926,SO I WON'T CALL AGAIN.
00:11:19.053,00:11:20.888,WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
00:11:22.723,00:11:27.270,I JUST CALLED BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU.
00:11:27.354,00:11:28.896,NO AGENDA.
00:11:28.980,00:11:31.316,"IF YOU WANNA TALK AGAIN, CALL ME."
00:11:31.399,00:11:33.943,"IF NOT, I UNDERSTAND. IT'S UP TO YOU."
00:11:34.027,00:11:35.654,YOU THINK I'M BEING UNREASONABLE?
00:11:35.736,00:11:41.075,"I THINK YOU'RE DOING WHATEVER IT IS YOU NEED TO DO, AND I'M NOT GONNA QUESTION IT."
00:11:41.159,00:11:43.244,IT WAS SWEET OF YOU TO CALL.
00:11:43.328,00:11:45.664,"LISTEN, YOU PROBABLY NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK."
00:11:45.746,00:11:49.250,I KNOW I DO. I SHOULD GO.
00:11:49.334,00:11:50.709,YEAH. OKAY.
00:11:50.793,00:11:52.504,- TAKE CARE. - OKAY.
00:12:05.308,00:12:09.688,"- FRANK, YOU GOT A MINUTE? - I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE."
00:12:12.232,00:12:15.235,"I WANNA BE GOVERNOR, AND I WANT YOUR HELP."
00:12:15.318,00:12:18.238,- AM I STILL ON THE SHORT LIST? - YOU ARE.
00:12:18.321,00:12:22.283,I HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK IN OVER A MONTH. I'M CLEAN.
00:12:22.367,00:12:24.869,"IS THAT BECAUSE I ASKED, OR BECAUSE IT'S WHAT YOU WANT?"
00:12:24.952,00:12:27.121,IT WAS ABOUT TIME I TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR MYSELF.
00:12:27.205,00:12:30.417,"TAKING RESPONSIBILITY IS ONE THING, AND IT'S ADMIRABLE."
00:12:30.500,00:12:33.086,BUT RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR OF A MAJOR STATE IS A WHOLE OTHER BALL GAME.
00:12:33.169,00:12:34.421,"LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRANK."
00:12:34.504,00:12:38.299,I GOT ELECTED TO CONGRESS 'CAUSE I SEIZED THE MOMENT THAT OPPORTUNITY STRUCK.
00:12:38.383,00:12:41.886,YOU KEPT ME ON THAT LIST. I WANNA SEIZE THAT OPPORTUNITY.
00:12:41.969,00:12:45.098,"IF YOU HELP ME OUT, I'LL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING I GOT."
00:12:47.225,00:12:49.519,ALL RIGHT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
00:12:49.603,00:12:51.145,"I NEED TO MAKE SOME CALLS, CHECK IN WITH SOME PEOPLE."
00:12:51.229,00:12:52.689,GIVE ME A FEW DAYS. I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.
00:12:52.731,00:12:54.065,"- OF COURSE. - AND, PETER..."
00:12:55.774,00:13:00.071,I FEEL LIKE I'VE MET THE REAL YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME JUST NOW.
00:13:24.345,00:13:26.640,JANET.
00:13:27.974,00:13:30.351,- IS THIS A BAD TIME? - NO.
00:13:30.435,00:13:31.978,"NO, NOT AT ALL."
00:13:32.061,00:13:33.980,I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE COMING.
00:13:35.982,00:13:38.568,"- OH, NO. I'M FINE. - I'LL TAKE THESE."
00:13:38.652,00:13:40.111,THANK YOU.
00:13:41.780,00:13:45.074,"- HELLO, STEVE. - HEY."
00:13:45.158,00:13:48.286,THESE COULD USE SOME WATER. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
00:13:50.829,00:13:54.250,FRANCIS AND I WERE SO UPSET WHEN WE HEARD.
00:13:54.334,00:13:56.919,I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T COME SOONER.
00:13:57.003,00:13:59.172,I DIDN'T WANT TOO MANY PEOPLE KNOWING.
00:13:59.255,00:14:01.174,YES.
00:14:01.257,00:14:03.176,FRANCIS WISHES HE COULD BE HERE.
00:14:03.259,00:14:06.095,HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW HE'S PRAYING FOR YOU.
00:14:06.179,00:14:13.561,"- COULDN'T MAKE IT, HUH? - NO, THERE'S A BIG TEACHERS' STRIKE GOING ON RIGHT NOW, AND HE'S BEEN STUCK IN HIS OFFICE FOR WEEKS."
00:14:13.645,00:14:15.563,I GET IT. I SAW ON THE NEWS.
00:14:15.647,00:14:19.526,- THE BRICK. - RIGHT.
00:14:19.609,00:14:24.364,I TOLD FRANCIS THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU WERE THERE.
00:14:24.447,00:14:28.201,NO. PROBABLY NOT.
00:14:32.580,00:14:36.417,I NEVER SEEN HIM PRAY.
00:14:36.501,00:14:38.628,NOT IN EIGHT YEARS.
00:14:40.588,00:14:44.091,YOU SAID HE WAS PRAYING FOR ME.
00:14:47.887,00:14:50.056,YOU'VE SEEN US IN CHURCH.
00:14:51.850,00:14:53.852,I NEVER WENT INSIDE.
00:14:57.772,00:14:59.106,THEY'RE JUST GORGEOUS.
00:14:59.190,00:15:01.108,"MRS. UNDERWOOD, THANK YOU SO MUCH."
00:15:03.528,00:15:05.780,- I KNOW YOU GOT THINGS TO DO. - OF COURSE.
00:15:05.864,00:15:09.659,"IF YOU NEED ANYTHING AT ALL, CALL ME. YOU HAVE MY CELL."
00:15:09.743,00:15:13.621,ANYTHING AT ALL. AND I'M SORRY TO HAVE SURPRISED YOU.
00:15:13.705,00:15:16.457,NO. IT WAS SO NICE OF YOU TO COME.
00:15:16.541,00:15:19.168,THANK YOU. I KNOW STEVE APPRECIATED IT.
00:15:21.128,00:15:22.756,CHECK THIS OUT.
00:15:33.558,00:15:35.017,GET MORE.
00:15:42.233,00:15:44.611,BRING IT ON!
00:15:44.694,00:15:48.155,WE NEED TO GIVE THE TEACHERS THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE.
00:16:06.758,00:16:09.176,- WE'VE GOTTA FACE IT HEAD-ON. - THEY PROVOKED US.
00:16:09.260,00:16:11.638,THEY WERE THROWING FOAM. OUR GUYS WERE THROWING PUNCHES.
00:16:11.721,00:16:13.180,WE'RE GONNA COME OFF THE BAD GUYS HERE.
00:16:13.264,00:16:16.183,OKAY. OKAY. I GET IT. I GET IT.
00:16:16.267,00:16:18.645,BUT I WANNA BE SMART ABOUT THIS.
00:16:18.728,00:16:26.026,"I WANNA DO SOMETHING DEFINITIVE THAT'LL PUT THIS TO BED - AND GET US BACK ON MESSAGE. - CNN, ONE ON ONE, YOU AND UNDERWOOD."
00:16:27.445,00:16:29.322,FRANK IS EXCELLENT IN DEBATES.
00:16:29.405,00:16:32.074,GO STRONG AGAINST HIM. ADDRESS THE BRICK RIGHT TO HIS FACE.
00:16:32.158,00:16:35.954,- END OF STORY. - UNDERWOOD SAYS HE'S IN IF YOU ARE.
00:16:36.036,00:16:38.790,"OKAY. BUT I WANT AS MUCH PREP AS POSSIBLE, OKAY?"
00:16:38.873,00:16:40.249,I WANT TO RUN QUESTIONS.
00:16:40.333,00:16:42.794,"YOU MODERATE, YOU PLAY UNDERWOOD."
00:16:42.877,00:16:44.712,WEAR THIS ONE.
00:16:48.633,00:16:50.718,THEN COME IN HERE. I WANNA PUT POWDER ON YOU.
00:16:50.802,00:16:52.887,"WELL, SOMEBODY AT THE STUDIO CAN DO THAT."
00:16:52.971,00:16:56.140,"YES, AND THEY ALWAYS CAKE ON TOO MUCH. I'M DOING IT."
00:16:59.059,00:17:01.270,HOW BLOODY DO YOU THINK IT'LL BE?
00:17:01.354,00:17:05.525,"OH, I THINK I OUGHTA BE ABLE TO DISPATCH WITH HIM EASILY ENOUGH."
00:17:05.608,00:17:08.194,"OH, YOU REMEMBER PETER RUSSO?"
00:17:08.277,00:17:10.822,HE'S DOING WELL. HE HASN'T HAD A DRINK IN A MONTH.
00:17:10.905,00:17:12.824,"OH, GOOD FOR HIM. I LIKE HIM."
00:17:15.201,00:17:17.036,- HOW? - WE'RE RUNNING HIM FOR GOVERNOR.
00:17:17.119,00:17:19.372,- AMBITIOUS. - MMM.
00:17:19.455,00:17:21.708,WE WANNA CREATE JOBS IN HIS DISTRICT.
00:17:21.791,00:17:23.584,IT'S ON THE DELAWARE RIVER.
00:17:23.668,00:17:26.212,I THOUGHT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT A BILL TOGETHER.
00:17:26.295,00:17:28.339,SOMETHING WITH AN ECONOMIC UPSIDE.
00:17:28.422,00:17:30.299,THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SHIPYARD CLOSING?
00:17:30.383,00:17:33.678,WE NEED THE SHIPBUILDERS' SUPPORT FOR HIS CAMPAIGN.
00:17:33.761,00:17:37.015,YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DRAFT A BILL THAT HE CAN SPONSOR?
00:17:37.097,00:17:40.226,"I'M REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS, FRANCIS."
00:17:40.309,00:17:41.853,NOT DOMESTIC LEGISLATION.
00:17:41.936,00:17:44.564,"I UNDERSTAND, BUT I COULD REALLY USE YOUR HELP, CLAIRE."
00:17:44.647,00:17:47.149,DOES CATHERINE DURANT STILL OWE US?
00:17:47.233,00:17:50.319,"WHEN YOU MAKE SOMEONE SECRETARY OF STATE, THEY OWE YOU FOR LIFE."
00:17:50.403,00:17:53.406,WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING OUR WATER FILTERS THROUGH SUDANESE CUSTOMS.
00:17:53.489,00:17:55.533,- I'LL CALL FROM THE CAR. - TOMORROW'S FINE.
00:17:55.616,00:17:58.285,- I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT ANYWAY. - I KNOW.
00:17:58.369,00:18:00.038,I'M READY FOR BATTLE.
00:18:00.120,00:18:01.372,YOU WANNA COME WATCH?
00:18:01.455,00:18:04.375,"- NO. YOU GO ON AHEAD. - OH, COME ON."
00:18:04.458,00:18:06.293,WATCH ME PUT THE FINAL NAIL IN SPINELLA'S COFFIN.
00:18:06.377,00:18:07.628,IT'LL BE FUN.
00:18:14.886,00:18:16.888,FRANK.
00:18:29.358,00:18:33.863,"YES, I WOULD. TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER'S MONEY BEING WASTED."
00:18:33.947,00:18:36.032,"AND CONGRESS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITSELF FOR THAT, FRANK."
00:18:39.619,00:18:40.954,"- NO, WE DIDN'T. - REALLY, FRANK?"
00:18:41.037,00:18:50.421,"WHEN YOU THREATEN TEACHERS' ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE AS A UNION, WHEN YOU THREATEN THEIR JOB SECURITY, YOU THREATEN THEIR LIVELIHOOD, OF COURSE YOU FORCE THEM TO STRIKE."
00:18:50.504,00:18:53.466,AND DID WE ALSO FORCE THEM TO START THROWING BRICKS AT PEOPLE'S HOUSES?
00:18:53.549,00:19:00.389,"I'M REALLY GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP, BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF THAT THAT INCIDENT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS STRIKE."
00:19:00.473,00:19:06.980,"AND I WANNA TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY PUBLICLY THAT WE CATEGORICALLY CONDEMN ANY USE OF VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER, OR INTIMIDATION."
00:19:07.063,00:19:11.191,"WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, ESSENTIALLY, IS THAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR OWN PEOPLE."
00:19:11.275,00:19:13.527,- THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M SAYING. - THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. YOU'RE DISORGANIZED.
00:19:13.611,00:19:26.332,"- DISORGANIZED LABOR. - YOU CAN KEEP TROTTING OUT THAT PHRASE ALL YOU LIKE, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO, FRANK? I WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE ISSUE HERE OF EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN AND THE FACT THAT CONGRESS IS NOT LIVING UP TO THEIR COMMITMENT."
00:19:26.415,00:19:27.792,"WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE?"
00:19:29.627,00:19:31.545,AN APOLOGY.
00:19:31.629,00:19:34.841,"IF NOT TO ME, THEN TO MY WIFE."
00:19:34.924,00:19:37.551,"WHEN THAT BRICK CAME THROUGH OUR WINDOW, IT WAS TERRIFYING."
00:19:37.635,00:19:40.262,SHE'S STANDING RIGHT OVER THERE.
00:19:48.604,00:19:51.065,- ARE YOU SERIOUS? - YES.
00:19:53.693,00:19:55.611,OKAY.
00:19:58.405,00:20:08.415,"MRS. UNDERWOOD, CLAIRE, I AM SINCERELY SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT ORDEAL, TRULY."
00:20:08.499,00:20:14.630,AND IT ACTUALLY SICKENS ME THAT SOMEONE MADE YOU FEEL UNSAFE IN YOUR OWN HOME.
00:20:14.714,00:20:21.470,"AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, NONE OF OUR PEOPLE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT."
00:20:21.554,00:20:24.223,BUT YOU KNOW WHAT SICKENS ME MORE?
00:20:24.306,00:20:30.021,"THAT RIGHT NOW, YOUR HUSBAND IS USING YOU AS A PROP ON NATIONAL TELEVISION TO TRY AND WIN A DEBATE."
00:20:30.104,00:20:33.649,"SO I THINK YOU'RE THE ONE THAT OWES YOUR WIFE AN APOLOGY, FRANK."
00:20:33.733,00:20:38.362,"AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE APOLOGIZING, CAN WE PLEASE GET BACK TO THE ISSUE HERE OF EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN?"
00:20:38.445,00:20:39.822,"NO. YOU'VE GOT THIS WRONG, MARTY."
00:20:39.906,00:20:43.034,THERE IS NO YOU AND I IN EDUCATION.
00:20:43.117,00:20:47.663,"WELL, I MEAN, YES, THERE'S THE LETTERS U AND I ARE IN THE WORD EDUCATION."
00:20:47.747,00:20:50.374,BUT EDUCATION WITH A CAPITAL E...

00:21:00.134,00:21:04.180,U AND I-- EDUCATION.
00:21:04.263,00:21:08.726,"SO, WHAT, WE'RE GONNA WASTE THE REST OF THIS DEBATE NAMING ALL THE VOWELS IN-- I'M HAPPY TO PLAY THE VOWEL GAME."
00:21:08.809,00:21:10.186,YOU WANNA PLAY THE VOWEL GAME WITH ME?
00:21:10.269,00:21:19.028,ALL RIGHT. U THINK I O U A APOLOGY.
00:21:19.112,00:21:20.654,"BUT NO, NO, NO."
00:21:20.738,00:21:24.742,U O I...
00:21:24.825,00:21:28.621,INTERESTING. YOU LEFT OUT E FOR EDUCATION.

00:21:39.339,00:21:41.259,WHY DON'T YOU GIVE THE KIDS THE MONEY THEY DESERVE?
00:21:41.341,00:21:44.553,WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY ABOUT EDUCATION...
00:21:47.347,00:21:49.267,I GUESS SCHOOL'S STILL IN SESSION.
00:21:49.349,00:21:51.185,"I GUESS YOU SCHOOLED ME THERE, MARTY."
00:21:51.269,00:21:53.520,LET'S MOVE ON. PLEASE.
00:21:53.604,00:21:56.107,"HUMOR ASIDE, THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES OUT THERE."
00:22:00.861,00:22:04.698,I HAD NO INTENTION OF BRINGING YOU INTO THIS.
00:22:04.782,00:22:07.243,IT WASN'T PART OF A PLAN. I WOULD'VE TOLD YOU IF IT WAS.
00:22:07.326,00:22:08.869,I KNOW.
00:22:08.953,00:22:11.289,"THE IDEA JUST STRUCK ME, AND I WENT WITH IT."
00:22:15.918,00:22:18.171,I DON'T MIND THAT YOU IMPROVISED.
00:22:18.254,00:22:21.340,I JUST WISH YOU'D DONE IT BETTER.
00:22:40.067,00:22:48.826,"CONGRESSMAN FRANK UNDERWOOD SAYS HE GOT, QUOTE, SCHOOLED BY A.F.T. SPOKESMAN AND CHIEF STRATEGIST, MARTIN SPINELLA, DURING A DEBATE LAST NIGHT ON THIS NETWORK."
00:22:48.909,00:22:54.748,"IN THE PAST 24 HOURS, RERUNS OF THE GAFFE HAVE PLAYED NON-STOP ON TV NEWS PROGRAMS AND THE INTERNET."
00:22:54.832,00:23:01.630,"A YOUTUBE CLIP SET TO TECHNO MUSIC HAS LOGGED MORE THAN 300,000 HITS AND SPAWNED DOZENS OF OTHER SPOOFS."
00:23:08.304,00:23:12.432,THAT WAS AS CLUMSY AS THE LEE HARVEY OSWALD PRISON TRANSFER.
00:23:12.516,00:23:14.268,WHAT WAS HE THINKING?
00:23:23.361,00:23:25.403,JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

00:24:03.650,00:24:04.944,WE CROSSED HIM OFF.
00:24:05.027,00:24:06.653,I KNOW. IT'S A MISTAKE.
00:24:06.737,00:24:08.530,"HE'S YOUNG, HE'S HANDSOME. HE'S BRIGHT."
00:24:10.950,00:24:12.743,"THERE'S NO DONOR BASE, NO INFRASTRUCTURE."
00:24:12.826,00:24:14.995,YOU START ME OFF WITH FUNDING FROM THE D.N.C.
00:24:15.079,00:24:16.956,AND I'LL RAISE AN ARMY AROUND THIS GUY.
00:24:17.039,00:24:19.208,I WILL PERSONALLY OVERSEE HIS CAMPAIGN.
00:24:21.710,00:24:23.379,IS THAT THE BEST WE CAN DO?
00:24:23.461,00:24:26.382,WHAT'S BETTER THAN A BLANK SLATE IN THE RIGHT HANDS?
00:24:28.550,00:24:29.843,"ED, YOU NEED TO GO."
00:24:29.927,00:24:31.845,"CONGRESSMAN, DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?"

00:24:38.685,00:24:40.313,"ONE SECOND, SIR. PLEASE."
00:24:40.396,00:24:42.731,"ALL RIGHT. MAKE IT FAST, MEECHUM."
00:24:42.815,00:24:47.903,"IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME TO ASK THIS, BUT I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD PUT IN A GOOD WORD WITH MY BOSS."
00:24:47.987,00:24:49.363,A GOOD WORD?
00:24:49.447,00:24:51.865,"THEY'RE GOING TO DISCHARGE ME, SIR."
00:24:51.949,00:24:53.491,I MESSED UP. I'M FULLY AWARE.
00:24:53.575,00:25:03.210,"BUT MY JOB, IT MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME, AND I KNOW A GOOD WORD FROM YOU WOULD-- LOOK, I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST YOU PERSONALLY, MEECHUM, BUT I CAN'T GET INVOLVED IN THESE SORT OF AFFAIRS."
00:25:03.294,00:25:04.586,THERE'S PROTOCOLS AND RULES.
00:25:04.670,00:25:08.674,"SIR, PLEASE, IF YOU SPOKE TO CARDIFF-- THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN DO."
00:25:08.757,00:25:12.428,"IF ANYONE CAN CONVINCE THE CAPTAIN, IT WOULD BE YOU, CONGRESSMAN."
00:25:12.510,00:25:15.348,"I'M SORRY. I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST, MEECHUM."
00:25:15.431,00:25:17.141,DOUG.
00:25:20.144,00:25:21.561,WHAT DID BARNEY HULL SAY?
00:25:21.645,00:25:22.938,THAT WE'D BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.
00:25:23.022,00:25:25.399,I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE 911 CALL.
00:25:25.483,00:25:26.900,THERE'S BEEN PLENTY.
00:25:26.984,00:25:28.902,IT'S JUST NOT THE SORT WE'RE AFTER.
00:25:28.986,00:25:30.737,WE GOT THAT KID IN ATLANTA.
00:25:30.821,00:25:32.906,"NO, IT'S GOT TO BE HERE. I CAN'T BE GETTING ON A PLANE."
00:25:32.990,00:25:34.241,IT LOOKS TOO OPPORTUNISTIC.
00:25:34.325,00:25:35.617,MAYBE IF WE OPEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
00:25:35.701,00:25:37.161,"NO, WE CANNOT LOWER OUR STANDARDS."
00:25:37.244,00:25:39.830,WE JUST HAVE TO BE PATIENT.
00:25:39.913,00:25:44.377,"NEW RULE-- NOW THAT THE DEBATE'S OVER, FRANK UNDERWOOD HAS TO TELL US WHAT THE HELL THAT WAS."
00:25:44.460,00:25:46.712,"SERIOUSLY, CONGRESSMAN, WAS THAT A JOKE?"
00:25:46.795,00:25:50.508,"I HAVEN'T SEEN SOMETHING JUST LAY THERE LIKE THAT SINCE, UH..."
00:25:50.590,00:25:52.468,I GOTTA GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO MY PROM NIGHT.
00:25:57.515,00:25:59.725,CAN WE JUST SETTLE THIS STRIKE PLEASE?
00:25:59.808,00:26:04.397,"TEACHERS HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE CLASSROOM FOR SO LONG, MIDDLE SCHOOLERS ARE STARTING TO HAVE SEX WITH EACH OTHER."
00:26:07.941,00:26:10.610,I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU HAD IT ON IN THE FIRST PLACE.
00:26:13.447,00:26:17.159,"I LOVE YOU, FRANCIS."
00:26:17.243,00:26:19.577,I KNOW.
00:26:19.661,00:26:22.915,WE SHOULD SAY THAT MORE OFTEN TO EACH OTHER.
00:26:26.919,00:26:28.795,I NEED TO CLEAR MY HEAD.
00:27:03.456,00:27:05.958,...NORTH AND EAST OF THE AIRPORT.
00:27:06.041,00:27:08.544,I'M GONNA NEED THAT IN TIME FOR THAT MEETING.
00:27:08.626,00:27:10.421,"PETER, LET'S TALK."
00:27:16.469,00:27:19.263,SO. I'VE SPOKEN TO PATRICIA WHITTAKER.
00:27:19.346,00:27:20.973,SHE'S ON BOARD.
00:27:21.056,00:27:24.059,YOU'LL BE GETTING FOUR MILLION IN START-UP FUNDING FROM THE D.N.C.
00:27:24.143,00:27:26.186,I'LL PICK THE TEAM. YOU ANNOUNCE IN AUGUST.
00:27:26.270,00:27:28.606,BUT THE CAMPAIGN STARTS TODAY.
00:27:28.688,00:27:29.982,ARE YOU READY?
00:27:30.065,00:27:32.151,I'VE ALREADY PUT TOGETHER A PLATFORM.
00:27:32.234,00:27:33.944,"IT'S MOSTLY BROAD STROKES, BUT WE CAN HONE IT."
00:27:34.027,00:27:37.531,GOOD. THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO ADDRESS IS YOUR SOBRIETY.
00:27:37.615,00:27:39.074,"OH, YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT."
00:27:39.158,00:27:40.409,HAVE YOU BEEN GOING TO MEETINGS?
00:27:40.493,00:27:42.869,YOU MEAN A.A.?
00:27:42.953,00:27:45.122,- YES. - THAT'S NOT REALLY MY THING.
00:27:45.205,00:27:52.171,"IF YOU WANT MY HELP, THEN GOING TO MEETINGS IS MY ONE REQUIREMENT."
00:27:52.254,00:27:53.880,"I KNOW I HAD A PROBLEM, FRANK."
00:27:53.964,00:27:55.257,I ACCEPT THAT.
00:27:55.341,00:27:59.553,"AND I'VE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT, BUT I DON'T THINK GOING TO MEETINGS IS NECESSARY."
00:27:59.637,00:28:02.097,"YOU CANNOT WHITE-KNUCKLE YOUR RECOVERY, PETER."
00:28:02.181,00:28:05.142,THIS CAMPAIGN WILL BE THE HARDEST THING YOU'VE EVER DONE IN YOUR LIFE.
00:28:05.225,00:28:06.852,I REALIZE THAT. I'M PREPARED FOR THAT.
00:28:06.935,00:28:09.687,YOU THINK YOU ARE. BUT WE CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES.
00:28:09.771,00:28:12.149,THE PARTY'S INVESTING IN YOU.
00:28:12.232,00:28:15.693,I NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE INVESTING IN YOURSELF.
00:28:19.448,00:28:22.451,ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO.
00:28:22.535,00:28:23.701,GOOD. YOU'LL START TOMORROW MORNING.
00:28:23.785,00:28:26.079,- DOUG WILL TAKE YOU. - STAMPER?
00:28:26.163,00:28:27.414,HE'S BEEN SOBER 14 YEARS.
00:28:27.498,00:28:29.082,DOUG HAS A DRINKING PROBLEM?
00:28:29.166,00:28:31.877,HAD. NOT ANYMORE. HE'LL BE YOUR SPONSOR.
00:28:31.960,00:28:33.837,"IN THE MEANTIME, I WANT YOU TO MEET WITH MY WIFE, CLAIRE."
00:28:33.920,00:28:35.381,SHE RUNS THE CLEAN WATER INITIATIVE.
00:28:35.464,00:28:38.717,"SHE'S EXPECTING YOU, SO CLEAR YOUR SCHEDULE AND HEAD OVER THERE NOW."
00:28:38.800,00:28:40.678,FRANK.
00:28:42.137,00:28:43.972,THANK YOU.
00:28:44.056,00:28:46.392,FOR BELIEVING IN ME.
00:28:46.475,00:28:48.935,"YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A GREAT CANDIDATE, PETER."
00:28:58.654,00:29:02.366,OUR GOAL IS TO PASS A WATERSHED ACT FOR THE DELAWARE RIVER.
00:29:02.449,00:29:06.662,"WE DEVELOP THE LAND IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY-RESPONSIBLE WAY, CREATING JOBS IN THE PROCESS."
00:29:06.745,00:29:08.664,HOW MANY JOBS? THOUSANDS.
00:29:08.747,00:29:11.458,WE'RE AIMING FOR THE $200 MILLION MARK.
00:29:11.542,00:29:12.876,WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
00:29:12.959,00:29:17.005,"WE DO, BUT YOU CAN START WITH THE CONGRESSMAN WHOSE DISTRICTS FALL WITHIN THE WATERSHED."
00:29:17.089,00:29:18.757,DO YOU HAVE A DRAFT OF THE BILL YOU CAN SHOW ME?
00:29:18.840,00:29:20.718,WE HAVEN'T SPONSORED ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION.
00:29:24.555,00:29:26.848,WE'LL DRAFT IT IN CONSULTATION WITH YOUR STAFF.
00:29:26.932,00:29:28.601,GILLIAN WILL BE THE POINT PERSON ON OUR END.
00:29:28.684,00:29:30.269,I DON'T HAVE ANY LEGISLATION EXPERIENCE.
00:29:30.352,00:29:31.353,- I'LL HELP YOU. - WHEN DO WE START?
00:29:31.437,00:29:32.854,WE JUST DID.
00:29:32.938,00:29:34.648,WILL YOU INTRODUCE HIM TO THE RESEARCH TEAM?
00:29:34.732,00:29:37.192,- I'LL BE THERE IN ONE SECOND. - SURE.
00:29:46.326,00:29:47.536,I WANT IT OVER.
00:29:47.620,00:29:48.828,AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
00:29:48.912,00:29:50.163,"GUT THE BILL, FRANK."
00:29:50.247,00:29:51.498,DO WHATEVER'S NECESSARY TO END THIS.
00:29:51.582,00:29:54.960,"MR. PRESIDENT, IF WE GIVE IN NOW, THE PUBLIC WON'T CREDIT YOU WITH A VICTORY."
00:29:55.043,00:29:58.046,NOT EVEN A HOLLOW ONE. THEY'LL CHALK IT UP AS A COLOSSAL DEFEAT.
00:29:58.130,00:29:59.548,"WELL, THAT'S ON YOU, FRANK."
00:29:59.632,00:30:01.967,YOU LET THIS SITUATION DEVOLVE TO WHERE IT IS.
00:30:02.050,00:30:05.763,I'VE ALREADY BEEN BLAMED FOR THE LARGEST TEACHERS' STRIKE IN U.S. HISTORY.
00:30:05.845,00:30:09.141,I WON'T BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT DRAGGING ON MONTHS AND MONTHS.
00:30:09.224,00:30:11.435,"MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO END THIS STRIKE ON YOUR TERMS."
00:30:11.518,00:30:12.728,NOT ANYONE ELSE'S.
00:30:12.811,00:30:16.982,HOW? BY DEBATING MARTY SPINELLA ON CNN?
00:30:18.108,00:30:20.778,"SIR, YOU HAVE PLACED YOUR FAITH IN ME THUS FAR."
00:30:20.860,00:30:22.696,I WOULD ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO DO SO.
00:30:22.780,00:30:26.074,"WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING, FRANK, ISN'T WORKING, SO I'M STEPPING IN."
00:30:26.158,00:30:27.576,GUT THE BILL. LIKE LINDA SAID.
00:30:31.580,00:30:35.501,"I'M SORRY, MR. PRESIDENT, BUT I WILL NOT DO THAT."
00:30:36.960,00:30:39.755,"ARE YOU LETTING PRIDE CLOUD YOUR JUDGMENT, FRANK?"
00:30:39.838,00:30:43.550,"RESPECTFULLY, SIR, YOU'RE ALLOWING FEAR TO CLOUD YOURS."
00:30:43.634,00:30:47.763,NOT AN EASY THING TO SAY NO TO THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE FREE WORLD.
00:30:47.846,00:30:52.017,BUT SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY TO GAIN YOUR SUPERIOR'S RESPECT IS TO DEFY HIM.
00:30:57.105,00:30:58.774,"WHAT DO WE HAVE ON THE SCHEDULE, LINDA?"
00:30:58.816,00:31:00.526,YOUR MEETING WITH THE...
00:31:00.609,00:31:01.943,"THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT."
00:31:02.027,00:31:03.529,- DO YOU HAVE MY BRIEFING? - RIGHT HERE.
00:31:03.612,00:31:04.904,GOOD. LET'S LOOK IT OVER.
00:31:07.533,00:31:09.827,HI. HOW'D IT GO WITH PETER?
00:31:11.704,00:31:12.871,IS HE GAME?
00:31:12.954,00:31:14.164,COMPLETELY.
00:31:14.247,00:31:15.791,UGH. THANK YOU.
00:31:15.874,00:31:17.292,THAT'S A BIG WEIGHT OFF MY SHOULDERS.
00:31:17.376,00:31:18.460,YOU SOUND TIRED.
00:31:18.544,00:31:20.420,TIRED. IMPATIENT.
00:31:20.504,00:31:22.005,WHAT CAN I DO?
00:31:22.088,00:31:24.341,NOTHING. THIS ONE'S UP TO FATE.
00:31:24.424,00:31:27.511,I DON'T LIKE WHEN WE LEAVE THINGS TO FATE.
00:31:27.594,00:31:29.429,NEITHER DO I.
00:31:29.513,00:31:32.808,DOES THAT MEAN I'M GONNA HAVE THE BED TO MYSELF TONIGHT?
00:31:32.891,00:31:34.685,PROBABLY.
00:31:34.768,00:31:36.436,CAN'T DOUG MAN THE FORT?
00:31:36.520,00:31:39.147,"WELL, HE COULD, BUT I'D JUST TOSS AND TURN."
00:31:39.231,00:31:41.859,"IF I'M NOT GONNA SLEEP, I MIGHT AS WELL NOT SLEEP HERE."
00:31:41.941,00:31:43.736,"WELL, I'LL LEAVE THE RINGER ON."
00:31:43.819,00:31:45.987,CALL ME IF YOU WANT COMPANY.
00:31:46.071,00:31:48.948,I WILL. GOODNIGHT.
00:31:49.032,00:31:51.076,GOODNIGHT.
00:31:53.579,00:31:55.622,YOU SHOULD GO HOME. I CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.
00:31:55.706,00:31:58.208,VIGILANCE. IT'S GOOD FOR THE SOUL.
00:32:03.463,00:32:05.131,WHAT'S THAT?
00:32:05.215,00:32:07.384,DISORDERLY CONDUCT.
00:32:11.513,00:32:13.724,DO YOU BELIEVE IN KARMA?
00:32:13.807,00:32:15.517,ABSOLUTELY NOT.
00:32:15.601,00:32:18.019,"WELL, I DO."
00:32:18.103,00:32:19.855,AT LEAST TONIGHT.
00:32:19.938,00:32:21.648,GET CAPTAIN CARDIFF ON THE PHONE.
00:32:21.732,00:32:23.316,LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT MEECHUM.
00:32:23.400,00:32:24.443,WHAT?
00:32:24.526,00:32:26.319,GET HIM HIS JOB BACK.
00:32:26.403,00:32:27.404,HE FIRED HIS WEAPON.
00:32:27.487,00:32:29.197,HE OVERREACTED.
00:32:29.281,00:32:30.866,CARDIFF. ON THE PHONE. NOW.
00:32:37.372,00:32:39.374,"NANCY, GIVE ME CAPTAIN CARDIFF, PLEASE."
00:32:39.458,00:32:43.378,WE MIGHT AS WELL DO ONE PRODUCTIVE THING WHILE WE WAIT.
00:32:43.462,00:32:46.757,IT REQUIRES VERY LITTLE OF ME AND WILL MEAN THE WORLD TO HIM.
00:32:46.840,00:32:49.175,IT'S A VERY INEXPENSIVE INVESTMENT.
00:32:49.259,00:32:50.260,"HELLO, SIR. THIS IS DOUG STAMPER."
00:32:50.343,00:32:52.304,I HAVE FRANCIS UNDERWOOD FOR YOU.
00:32:52.387,00:32:54.431,I GOT HIM ON.
00:32:56.349,00:33:02.439,"CAPTAIN, I KNOW IT'S LATE, BUT I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT EDWARD MEECHUM."
00:33:09.947,00:33:12.365,"GOOD MORNING, GENTLEMEN."
00:33:18.497,00:33:20.290,THANK YOU.
00:33:23.042,00:33:25.838,- ARE YOU HUNGRY? - MM-HMM.
00:33:41.394,00:33:42.896,YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE GETTING IN?
00:33:42.980,00:33:45.190,"NAH, THEY MADE ME PUT IT THROUGH THE X-RAY MACHINE TWICE."
00:33:45.273,00:33:48.026,SO I HOPE IT DIDN'T OVERCOOK IT.
00:33:48.109,00:33:50.904,"FRANK, YOU ALWAYS PAY TOO MUCH. THIS IS WAY TOO MUCH."
00:33:50.988,00:33:52.823,FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.
00:33:52.906,00:33:56.869,"YOU KNOW, 20 YEARS YOU BEEN COMING TO MY JOINT."
00:33:56.952,00:33:58.829,THIS THE FIRST TIME I BEEN TO YOURS.
00:33:58.912,00:34:01.164,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:34:01.247,00:34:02.332,I COULD GET USED TO IT.
00:34:02.415,00:34:03.917,"WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME ANY TIME."
00:34:05.293,00:34:06.336,"ALWAYS, FRANK."
00:34:12.425,00:34:14.177,GET DETAILS.
00:34:29.735,00:34:32.070,"SIR, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO THE CAPTAIN."
00:34:32.153,00:34:36.491,"HE TOLD ME YOU CALLED, AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM."
00:34:37.826,00:34:41.496,I WANT YOU TO LISTEN VERY CLOSELY TO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY.
00:34:41.580,00:34:45.959,"FROM THIS MOMENT ON, YOU ARE A ROCK."
00:34:46.043,00:34:53.174,"YOU ABSORB NOTHING, YOU SAY NOTHING, AND NOTHING BREAKS YOU."
00:34:53.258,00:34:55.635,"- IS THAT CLEAR? - YES, SIR."
00:34:55.719,00:34:57.637,WELCOME BACK.
00:35:35.717,00:35:36.927,STEVE?
00:35:37.010,00:35:38.762,I'LL LEAVE YOU BE.
00:35:40.055,00:35:43.349,"WHERE, UH-- WHERE'S JANET?"
00:35:43.433,00:35:46.561,SHE'S BEEN HERE EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS.
00:35:46.645,00:35:49.481,"I TOLD HER GO HOME, GET SOME REST."
00:35:49.564,00:35:50.899,"WELL, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?"
00:35:50.983,00:35:52.901,YOUR TEXT SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT.
00:35:52.985,00:35:56.195,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS.
00:35:56.279,00:35:59.825,"THE THING IS, I..."
00:35:59.908,00:36:01.827,I'VE BEEN THINKING.
00:36:01.910,00:36:03.870,A LOT.
00:36:08.166,00:36:11.377,ABOUT THE THINGS I HAVEN'T DONE.
00:36:11.461,00:36:14.714,THINGS I HAVEN'T SAID.
00:36:16.758,00:36:19.469,I HATE YOUR HUSBAND.
00:36:24.141,00:36:27.435,A LOT OF PEOPLE DO.
00:36:27.519,00:36:31.690,"THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, I WATCHED OVER HIM."
00:36:35.443,00:36:38.363,BUT IT WASN'T HIM I WAS WATCHING.
00:36:39.990,00:36:50.959,"AND EVERY TIME I SAW YOU, EVERY TIME I HEARD YOUR VOICE, ALL I COULD THINK TO MYSELF WAS, JESUS, WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE."
00:36:52.878,00:36:58.257,I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
00:37:07.059,00:37:10.353,YOU KNOW WHAT FRANCIS SAID TO ME WHEN HE PROPOSED?
00:37:10.436,00:37:12.772,I REMEMBER HIS EXACT WORDS.
00:37:12.856,00:37:19.571,"HE SAID, CLAIRE, IF ALL YOU WANT IS HAPPINESS, SAY NO."
00:37:19.654,00:37:25.577,I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF KIDS AND COUNT THE DAYS UNTIL RETIREMENT.
00:37:25.660,00:37:28.121,I PROMISE YOU FREEDOM FROM THAT.
00:37:28.205,00:37:32.084,I PROMISE YOU'LL NEVER BE BORED.
00:37:34.669,00:37:38.215,"YOU KNOW, HE WAS THE ONLY MAN-- AND THERE WERE A LOT OF OTHERS WHO PROPOSED."
00:37:38.297,00:37:44.221,BUT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO UNDERSTOOD ME.
00:37:44.303,00:37:46.973,HE DIDN'T PUT ME ON SOME PEDESTAL.
00:37:47.057,00:37:51.352,HE KNEW THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE ADORED OR CODDLED.
00:37:51.436,00:37:56.399,SO HE TOOK MY HAND AND HE PUT A RING ON IT.
00:37:56.482,00:37:59.360,BECAUSE HE KNEW I'D SAY YES.
00:37:59.444,00:38:03.949,HE'S A MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO TAKE WHAT HE WANTS.
00:38:15.168,00:38:17.712,IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED?
00:38:17.796,00:38:19.881,IS THAT THE WAY YOU WANTED IT?
00:38:19.965,00:38:22.675,STOP. STOP.
00:38:22.759,00:38:26.345,PLEASE. PLEASE. STOP.
00:38:26.429,00:38:28.306,DON'T.
00:38:34.687,00:38:37.190,YOU TOLD ME YOUR TRUTH.
00:38:37.274,00:38:38.942,NOW YOU KNOW MINE.
00:39:15.979,00:39:17.438,"HEY, IT'S PETER."
00:39:17.522,00:39:28.158,"I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO CALL ME BACK, BUT I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW I STOPPED DRINKING, AND I WENT TO MY FIRST A.A. MEETING."
00:39:28.241,00:39:34.080,"UM, I'M SUPPOSED TO REACH OUT AND MAKE AMENDS TO THOSE I'VE HURT."
00:39:35.665,00:39:41.504,BUT I GUESS THE REAL REASON I CALLED YOU IS JUST TO SAY I LOVE YOU AND I MISS YOU.
00:39:43.715,00:39:46.092,I HOPE YOU'RE WELL.
00:39:55.143,00:39:57.062,"THIS IS WORK, NOT PLAY."
00:39:57.145,00:39:59.272,THEN WHY'D YOU BOTHER COMING OVER?
00:39:59.356,00:40:02.192,I WAS HOPING YOU'D ANSWER THE DOOR NAKED.
00:40:02.275,00:40:03.776,THAT WOULD BE PLAY.
00:40:03.860,00:40:05.611,THAT WOULD BE WORK WITH A VIEW.
00:40:07.405,00:40:09.241,HOW MANY CHARACTERS IN A TWEET?
00:40:09.324,00:40:10.533,140.
00:40:10.616,00:40:13.494,"TYPE THIS, LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU LAND."
00:40:13.578,00:40:18.666,EIGHT-YEAR-OLD WASHINGTON D.C. BOY KILLED BY A STRAY BULLET IN GANGLAND SHOOT-OUT.
00:40:18.750,00:40:21.878,61 CHARACTERS LEFT.
00:40:21.961,00:40:24.964,SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN SCHOOL?
00:40:28.509,00:40:29.719,30 LEFT.
00:40:29.802,00:40:32.931,SPINELLA TO BLAME?

00:40:42.399,00:40:46.319,SHOT OUTSIDE HIS HOME IN SOUTHEAST JUST BEFORE NOON TODAY.
00:40:47.737,00:40:51.074,SENT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
00:40:51.157,00:40:52.867,- TO SEE THE MOTHER. - YOU DON'T WANNA...?
00:40:52.951,00:40:55.828,THERE'S WORK TO DO. I'LL SEE YOU LATER TONIGHT.
00:40:58.623,00:41:02.210,HE WAS A GOOD BOY.
00:41:06.464,00:41:08.258,IT'S OKAY.
00:41:08.341,00:41:12.804,"IF TYLER'S SCHOOL HAD BEEN IN SESSION, THIS SENSELESS KILLING WOULD HAVE NEVER TAKEN PLACE."
00:41:12.887,00:41:21.313,WE NEED TO END THIS STRIKE NOW AND GET ALL OUR CHILDREN BACK IN SCHOOL WHERE THEY BELONG BEFORE WE RISK ANOTHER DEATH LIKE THIS.
00:41:21.396,00:41:31.323,"SO, MR. SPINELLA, I AM HEADED TO THE CAPITOL RIGHT NOW, AND I WILL REMAIN THERE UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO MEET AND TALK SO THAT WE CAN END THIS POINTLESS STRIKE."
00:41:31.406,00:41:33.450,THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.
00:41:33.532,00:41:35.660,LET'S GO BACK INSIDE.
00:41:39.872,00:41:42.083,MR. SPINELLA IS NOT TO MAKE A COMMENT AT THIS TIME.
00:41:42.167,00:41:44.419,NO COMMENT. NO COMMENT.
00:41:53.428,00:41:55.513,THANK YOU.
00:42:01.060,00:42:03.062,FRANK.
00:42:12.489,00:42:14.282,SO?
00:42:15.783,00:42:17.827,YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO TALK.
00:42:20.538,00:42:24.959,YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO WORK OUT A COMPROMISE.
00:42:25.043,00:42:26.461,I LIED.
00:42:26.544,00:42:28.380,EXCUSE ME?
00:42:28.463,00:42:32.550,I HAVE NO INTENTION OF WORKING OUT A COMPROMISE.
00:42:34.344,00:42:37.680,"SO THEN WHY THE FUCK ARE WE HERE, FRANK?"
00:42:48.358,00:42:49.567,YOU THINK THIS IS SOME KIND OF A GAME?
00:42:49.650,00:42:51.069,NO.
00:42:51.152,00:42:53.363,THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES TO FEED.
00:42:58.617,00:43:01.162,WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP THAT?
00:43:03.873,00:43:06.418,"IN FIVE SECONDS, I'M OUT OF HERE."
00:43:06.501,00:43:11.381,ONE. TWO. THREE.
00:43:11.464,00:43:14.717,"- FOUR. - GOODBYE, FRANK."
00:43:14.800,00:43:18.012,"YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND ME, MARTY?"
00:43:22.725,00:43:26.938,I'M A WHITE-TRASH CRACKER FROM A WHITE-TRASH TOWN THAT NO ONE WOULD EVEN BOTHER TO PISS ON.
00:43:27.021,00:43:29.774,BUT HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE-- I'VE MADE SOMETHING OF MYSELF.
00:43:29.857,00:43:31.984,I HAVE THE KEYS TO THE CAPITOL. PEOPLE RESPECT ME.
00:43:32.068,00:43:33.736,"BUT YOU, YOU'RE STILL NOTHING."
00:43:33.819,00:43:38.074,YOU'RE JUST AN UPPITY DAGO IN AN EXPENSIVE SUIT TURNING TRICKS FOR THE UNIONS.
00:43:38.157,00:43:40.243,"NOBODY RESPECTS THE UNIONS ANYMORE, MARTY."
00:43:40.326,00:43:43.621,THEY'RE DYING. AND NO ONE RESPECTS YOU.
00:43:43.704,00:43:47.792,THE MOST YOU'LL EVER MAKE OF YOURSELF IS BLOWING MEN LIKE ME.
00:43:55.425,00:43:57.093,YOU THINK YOU CAN GET UNDER MY SKIN?
00:43:57.176,00:43:59.554,I KNOW I CAN.
00:43:59.637,00:44:03.141,"KISS MY ASS, FRANK."
00:44:03.224,00:44:04.683,YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO WALK OUT.
00:44:04.767,00:44:06.311,WATCH ME.
00:44:06.394,00:44:08.771,"I'VE GOT A DEAD, UNDERPRIVILEGED KID IN MY POCKET."
00:44:08.854,00:44:10.356,WHAT DO YOU HAVE?
00:44:10.440,00:44:13.485,I HAVE 2 MILLION HONORABLE TEACHERS.
00:44:13.568,00:44:16.446,FAIR ENOUGH. BUT I GOT SOMETHING EVEN BETTER.
00:44:20.617,00:44:23.786,GO AHEAD. OPEN IT.
00:44:27.165,00:44:28.707,OKAY.
00:44:28.791,00:44:30.460,I'LL PLAY YOUR GAME.
00:44:41.346,00:44:43.598,YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
00:44:45.724,00:44:48.144,STAMPER THREW IT.
00:44:56.986,00:44:58.613,"OH, NO, STAMPER THREW THE BRICK."
00:44:58.695,00:45:01.949,AND I MADE SURE CLAIRE DISTRACTED MY SECURITY.
00:45:02.033,00:45:04.577,ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
00:45:04.661,00:45:06.996,AND TO THINK YOU WANTED ME TO APOLOGIZE TO MY WIFE.
00:45:07.079,00:45:09.123,"YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT LOW, FRANK?"
00:45:09.207,00:45:12.960,"I ARRANGED THE BRICK, MARTY, JUST LIKE I ARRANGED THIS MEETING THIS AFTERNOON."
00:45:13.044,00:45:14.462,"BACK OFF, FRANK."
00:45:14.546,00:45:18.550,"WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES - WHERE YOU REALLY BELONG? - BACK OFF, FRANK."
00:45:18.633,00:45:22.345,BECAUSE THE ONLY THING YOU'RE GONNA GET FROM ME - IS CUM ON YOUR-- - FUCK YOU!
00:45:32.564,00:45:34.566,UGH.
00:45:46.619,00:45:48.287,AND WHO'S GOING TO BELIEVE YOU?
00:45:48.371,00:45:53.042,"YOU JUST ASSAULTED A UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN, WHICH IS A FELONY."
00:45:54.419,00:45:56.837,"BUT I'M NOT GONNA PRESS CHARGES, MARTY."
00:45:56.921,00:46:01.593,BECAUSE THE STRIKE ENDS NOW.
00:46:23.364,00:46:25.408,YOU THINK IT'LL LEAVE A SCAR?
00:46:25.491,00:46:28.244,I HAVE A THICK SKIN.
00:46:30.829,00:46:38.504,"THE NEXT TIME YOU ASK ME TO INVITE SOMEONE IN FOR COFFEE, WILL YOU PLEASE MAKE SURE NO GUNS GO OFF?"
00:46:38.588,00:46:40.965,I'LL DO MY BEST.
00:46:41.048,00:46:43.175,I SAW STEVE AGAIN TODAY.
00:46:43.259,00:46:44.552,HOW IS HE?
00:46:44.636,00:46:46.803,IN A LOT OF PAIN.
00:46:46.887,00:46:49.599,SHOULD I GO SEE HIM?
00:46:49.682,00:46:50.891,I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO.
00:46:54.604,00:46:55.812,ZOE BARNES.
00:46:57.732,00:47:00.777,"WHEN HE DIES, WE'LL PAY FOR HIS FUNERAL."
00:47:04.656,00:47:06.198,YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE IT?
00:47:06.282,00:47:11.203,NO. I'M DONE WITH WORK TODAY.
00:01:47.566,00:01:50.527,SET THEM UP OVER HERE.
00:03:32.921,00:03:34.756,VICE PRESIDENT MATTHEWS.
00:03:36.591,00:03:39.011,- BOB. - MR. VICE PRESIDENT.
00:03:58.279,00:04:00.323,- MR. VICE PRESIDENT. - FRANK.
00:04:07.748,00:04:09.208,I'M FINE RIGHT HERE.
00:04:24.848,00:04:28.227,"BOTH LEGS BROKEN, FRACTURED SKULL, PUNCTURED LUNG."
00:04:28.309,00:04:31.105,MY HEART STOPS. TWO FULL MINUTES.
00:04:31.188,00:04:33.565,THEY'RE PUMPING MY CHEST. NOTHING.
00:04:33.648,00:04:35.567,THEY GRAB THE DEFIBRILLATORS. PACHOOM!
00:04:35.650,00:04:37.360,NOTHING.
00:04:40.447,00:04:42.616,DOCTORS TELL ME IT'S A MIRACLE I'M ALIVE.
00:04:42.699,00:04:45.202,"BUT, SERIOUSLY, YOU TALK ABOUT A WAKE-UP CALL FROM GOD."
00:04:45.285,00:04:48.580,YOU DON'T GET TO COME BACK FROM THE DEAD TWICE.
00:05:07.849,00:05:09.768,GOOD MORNING.
00:05:09.851,00:05:25.742,"THE EDUCATION REFORM AND ACHIEVEMENT ACT THAT I SIGN INTO LAW TODAY WILL AFFECT EVERY CHILD AND PARENT IN THE UNITED STATES, WILL ENSURE A BETTER EDUCATED WORKFORCE FOR DECADES TO COME, AND WILL REINFORCE AMERICA'S PREEMINENCE AS AN INTELLECTUAL SUPERPOWER."
00:05:28.578,00:05:38.088,"AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ONE MAN IN PARTICULAR WHO NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THE LARGER MISSION, WHO SPEARHEADED THIS BILL FROM THE BEGINNING, AND THAT'S CONGRESSMAN FRANK UNDERWOOD."
00:06:16.877,00:06:18.670,IN THE EAST ROOM FOR REFRESHMENTS.
00:06:18.753,00:06:23.091,"MEDIA, WE WILL CONVENE IMMEDIATELY IN THE BRIEFING ROOM FOR OUR CONFERENCE."
00:06:33.518,00:06:34.853,"NO, THANK YOU, FRANK."
00:06:34.936,00:06:36.688,THIS WAS YOUR BABY FROM THE BEGINNING.
00:06:36.771,00:06:38.899,"I APPRECIATE YOU STANDING YOUR GROUND ON THIS ONE, FRANK."
00:06:38.982,00:06:41.360,I'M SMART ENOUGH TO ADMIT WHEN I WAS WRONG.
00:06:41.442,00:06:45.822,I WAS JUST TELLING FRANK WE SHOULD SET UP A WEEKLY SO HE CAN KEEP US UP TO DATE ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE HOUSE.
00:06:45.906,00:06:47.574,THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA.
00:06:47.657,00:06:49.576,"CONGRATULATIONS, SIR."
00:06:49.659,00:06:52.954,"GARRETT, I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD TALK FOR A FEW MINUTES."
00:06:53.038,00:06:59.044,"THAT THING I MENTIONED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ABOUT THE JOBS TAX CREDIT-- I'VE BEEN GIVING IT A LOT OF THOUGHT, JIM, AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA."
00:07:06.343,00:07:08.595,BUSY MAN.
00:07:08.678,00:07:10.597,"YES, HE IS."
00:07:10.680,00:07:16.561,"FRANK, I HEAR THAT YOU ARE HEADING UP THE SPECIAL ELECTION IN MY HOME STATE."
00:07:16.644,00:07:20.357,- PETER RUSSO. - WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP THAT UNDER THE RADAR UNTIL HE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCES.
00:07:20.440,00:07:22.943,"IN FACT, WE'RE NOT EVEN WORKING OUT OF MY OFFICE UNTIL THAT HAPPENS."
00:07:23.026,00:07:25.737,- WHERE ARE YOU WORKING FROM? - THE BASEMENT OF MY HOUSE.
00:07:25.820,00:07:29.490,ANY REASON WHY THE D.N.C. DIDN'T ASK MY ADVICE ON THE CANDIDATE?
00:07:29.574,00:07:32.035,"WELL, I THOUGHT THEY PASSED IT BY YOU, OR LINDA DID."
00:07:32.119,00:07:34.871,"- NOBODY DID. - WELL, THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE."
00:07:34.955,00:07:36.831,AND I HAVE MAJOR DOUBTS ABOUT RUSSO.
00:07:36.915,00:07:40.377,"- HIS INEXPERIENCE? - YES, AND HE'S URBAN-BASED."
00:07:40.460,00:07:42.587,- MM. - I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL CONNECT WITH RURAL VOTERS.
00:07:42.670,00:07:44.423,"LOOK, FRANKLY, THAT'S ONE OF MY CONCERNS AS WELL."
00:07:46.091,00:07:53.432,"BUT IF YOU WERE TO COME OUT AND STUMP WITH HIM, THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO CONVINCE-- FRANK, I CAN'T STUMP FOR SOMEBODY I DON'T BELIEVE IN."
00:07:53.514,00:07:56.184,IT'S EARLY DAYS YET. I'D ASK YOU TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND.
00:07:56.268,00:08:03.442,"AND LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO SET UP A MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU, BECAUSE, SIR, AN ENDORSEMENT FROM YOU WOULD BE A BIG COUP FOR HIM."
00:08:05.693,00:08:07.362,FRANK.
00:08:25.339,00:08:26.714,SLUGLINE JUST GOT ACCESS YESTERDAY.
00:08:26.798,00:08:31.136,"- I KNOW. - I LEFT THE HERALD BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA COVER THE WHITE HOUSE, AND NOW HERE I AM."
00:08:31.219,00:08:33.638,ACCESS ISN'T THE SAME AS A BALL AND CHAIN.
00:08:33.721,00:08:36.433,AM I ONLY GONNA SEE YOU AT BILL SIGNINGS NOW?
00:08:36.516,00:08:38.059,I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU IN THREE WEEKS.
00:08:38.143,00:08:39.936,INSECURITY BORES ME.
00:08:40.020,00:08:43.148,I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT CONDESCENSION.
00:08:43.231,00:08:46.360,"YOUR PLACE, THIS EVENING, AND I'LL TEXT YOU WHEN I'M ABOUT TO ARRIVE."
00:08:46.443,00:08:48.569,WHAT IF I'M BUSY?
00:08:48.653,00:08:51.114,YOU'RE JUST AFRAID I'M GONNA STAND YOU UP AGAIN.
00:08:51.198,00:08:53.367,I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S WORTH MY WHILE.
00:08:53.450,00:08:55.327,IT'LL BE WORTH YOUR WHILE.
00:08:55.410,00:08:57.120,THIS'LL MAKE UP FOR LAST TIME.
00:08:57.204,00:08:58.538,IT'S A PIECE OF HISTORY.
00:08:58.621,00:09:00.957,FROM THE PRESIDENT'S HAND TO YOURS.
00:09:05.712,00:09:07.422,THEY TALK ABOUT IN THE ROOM?
00:09:07.506,00:09:10.509,I BELIEVE THERE ARE THINGS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.
00:09:10.591,00:09:12.511,WHO OR WHAT'S CONTROLLING THEM-- THAT I DON'T KNOW.
00:09:12.593,00:09:14.513,I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD.
00:09:16.681,00:09:19.684,- TOO MUCH CATHOLIC SCHOOL? - MAYBE.
00:09:19.767,00:09:24.439,"I'M NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN GOD, PETER, OR ANYTHING, FOR THAT MATTER."
00:09:24.523,00:09:26.107,BUT YOU SHOULDN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT.
00:09:32.989,00:09:34.908,I SHOULD GO.
00:10:34.926,00:10:36.844,ARE WILLING TO CONSIDER A RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC.
00:10:36.928,00:10:41.391,"NOW, THOSE NUMBERS DIP A LITTLE WHEN YOU INTRODUCE COCAINE, BUT NOT BY MUCH. RANDY?"
00:10:41.475,00:10:43.101,"IT'S A RISK, BUT IT'LL MAKE WAVES."
00:10:43.184,00:10:44.727,FREE COVERAGE ACROSS THE BOARD.
00:10:44.811,00:10:46.187,THE NARRATIVE HAS TO BE REDEMPTION.
00:10:46.271,00:10:47.772,A PHOENIX FROM THE ASHES.
00:10:49.816,00:10:51.943,WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK PETER WAS A DISASTER.
00:10:54.154,00:10:57.115,A FRESH START AND A CLEAN START BOTH DID WELL IN FOCUS GROUPS.
00:10:57.198,00:10:59.618,CLEAN START SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE CLEAN SLATE.
00:10:59.700,00:11:01.620,"- I LIKE FRESH START. - YEAH, I DO TOO."
00:11:01.702,00:11:06.749,"- HOW WE DOING ON THE FUNDRAISING? - THE ALCOHOLIC THING WILL TURN OFF SOME OF THE IN-STATE DONORS, BUT IT'S AN OFF-YEAR ELECTION."
00:11:06.833,00:11:08.876,WE CAN HIT UP THE USUAL SUSPECTS IN NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA.
00:11:08.960,00:11:11.338,"WALTER, HOW VULNERABLE ARE WE?"
00:11:11.421,00:11:13.714,I'M NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
00:11:23.141,00:11:29.981,"CALLED THE DELAWARE RIVER WATERSHED ACT, AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BRING ABOUT 5,000 JOBS INTO PETER'S DISTRICTS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS."
00:11:30.064,00:11:31.983,WE HAVE A DRAFT OF THE BILL COMPLETED.
00:11:32.066,00:11:34.611,PETER'S IN THE PROCESS OF SECURING COSPONSORS.
00:11:36.695,00:11:40.283,"I HAVE SOME E-MAILS OUT, BUT MOST OF THEM WANNA SEE A BILL FIRST."
00:11:40.367,00:11:41.826,HAVE YOU SET UP A MEETING WITH THE SHIPBUILDERS YET?
00:11:41.909,00:11:43.495,I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA BACK ME.
00:11:43.578,00:11:45.622,"THAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE BILL, PETER."
00:11:45.704,00:11:57.551,"WELL, IF I GO TO THEM AND I SAY, HEY, SOME OF YOU MAYBE WILL GET YOUR JOBS BACK, NOT TOMORROW, BUT THREE YEARS FROM NOW, AND MOST OF YOU WON'T BE GETTING YOUR JOBS BACK ANYWAY-- ALL RIGHT, LET'S PUT A PIN IN THIS UNTIL WE GET MORE SPONSORS."
00:11:57.634,00:11:59.636,I HAVE TO GO TO THE OFFICE. I'LL CATCH YOU ALL LATER.
00:11:59.718,00:12:01.304,"OKAY, LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR FIELD PLAN."
00:12:01.388,00:12:03.139,I WANT TO GO THROUGH THE REGIONS ONE BY ONE...
00:12:03.223,00:12:05.350,FRANCIS.
00:12:05.433,00:12:07.810,WE SPENT SIX WEEKS ON THAT BILL.
00:12:07.894,00:12:10.188,IT'LL BE FINE. HE'LL COME AROUND.
00:12:11.690,00:12:13.441,I'LL SEE YOU LATER TONIGHT?
00:12:13.525,00:12:15.068,I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.
00:12:15.151,00:12:16.695,SO I WON'T SEE YOU UNTIL MORNING.
00:12:16.777,00:12:18.779,I'LL BE BACK BEFORE YOU GET UP.
00:12:22.200,00:12:24.827,"I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME TODAY, SIR."
00:12:24.911,00:12:28.122,DID YOU GET THAT TAX CREDIT MEMO THE ECONOMIC RESEARCH TEAM PUT TOGETHER?
00:12:28.206,00:12:30.375,YOU DIDN'T ASK ME HERE TO TALK ABOUT MEMOS.
00:12:30.458,00:12:32.126,"I KNOW SMALL TALK WHEN I HEAR IT, LINDA."
00:12:32.210,00:12:35.838,THE PRESIDENT HAS ASKED THAT YOU TAKE A STEP BACK FROM PENNSYLVANIA.
00:12:35.922,00:12:40.176,"YOU'VE BEEN TAKING A LOT OF TRIPS THERE, MEETING WITH LEGISLATORS-- IT'S MY HOME STATE. THERE'S A JOBS CRISIS."
00:12:40.260,00:12:42.178,WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PLAY FAVORITES.
00:12:42.262,00:12:44.389,"THE MESSAGE IS 50 STATES, ONE SOLUTION."
00:12:44.472,00:12:46.391,"NOT ONE STATE, 50 SOLUTIONS."
00:12:46.474,00:12:52.980,"I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE INVOLVED IN EVERY POLICY OR DECISION, BUT I HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY CUT OUT OF EVERYTHING."
00:12:53.064,00:12:57.652,"WE VALUE YOUR INPUT, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, - BUT RIGHT NOW, WE CAN'T-- - DON'T CONDESCEND, LINDA."
00:12:57.736,00:13:00.280,NO ONE EVEN ASKED ME WHO I THOUGHT SHOULD FILL MY SEAT.
00:13:00.363,00:13:02.657,"WHY IS FRANK UNDERWOOD LEADING THE CHARGE ON THAT, NOT ME?"
00:13:02.741,00:13:04.200,THAT IS A D.N.C. ISSUE.
00:13:04.284,00:13:06.661,WE ARE STAYING OUT OF IT AND SO SHOULD YOU.
00:13:06.745,00:13:09.872,AND SO I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST CUT RIBBONS AND GO TO FUNERALS?
00:13:09.956,00:13:12.250,YOU KNEW WHAT YOU SIGNED UP FOR.
00:13:21.676,00:13:24.220,- YOUR PEN? - FROM THE BILL SIGNING.
00:13:24.304,00:13:27.390,"OH, WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT."
00:13:41.321,00:13:43.822,HE'S CUTE.
00:13:43.906,00:13:45.866,HE'D NEVER GO FOR YOU.
00:13:45.950,00:13:47.285,WHY NOT?
00:13:47.368,00:13:49.120,YOU'RE TOO INTIMIDATING.
00:13:49.203,00:13:51.331,HE'S THE ONE WITH THE GUN.
00:13:51.414,00:13:54.000,BUT YOU'RE THE ONE WITH THE CONGRESSMAN.
00:13:56.377,00:13:57.504,UH-UH.
00:13:57.587,00:13:59.297,WE'LL TALK AFTER.
00:13:59.380,00:14:01.132,WE'LL TALK BEFORE.
00:14:03.468,00:14:05.219,PETER RUSSO.
00:14:05.303,00:14:07.096,PENNSYLVANIA'S FIRST DISTRICT.
00:14:08.973,00:14:10.308,FILL MATTHEWS' SEAT.
00:14:10.391,00:14:12.435,IT'S AN EXCLUSIVE PROFILE.
00:14:12.519,00:14:14.562,WITH SOMEONE NO ONE'S EVER HEARD OF.
00:14:14.646,00:14:16.189,WHAT'S THE ANGLE?
00:14:16.272,00:14:17.816,"ALCOHOL, DRUGS."
00:14:17.898,00:14:19.609,HE'S A KID FROM THE STREETS.
00:14:19.693,00:14:24.071,"I WANT THE PROFILE TO COME OUT AS SOON AS HE ANNOUNCES, AND I'D LIKE IT TO BE KIND."
00:14:24.155,00:14:26.073,I DON'T WRITE PUFF PIECES.
00:14:26.157,00:14:28.284,THEN GET SOMEONE ELSE TO WRITE IT.
00:14:28.368,00:14:30.036,I THOUGHT YOU HAD SOMETHING FOR ME.
00:14:30.119,00:14:32.622,IT'S TOO EASY FOR PEOPLE TO LINK ME AS YOUR SOURCE.
00:14:32.706,00:14:35.124,IT'S DANGEROUS.
00:14:35.208,00:14:38.919,I DON'T BENEFIT FROM HANDING OUT HEADLINES TO OTHER PEOPLE.
00:14:44.759,00:14:48.555,"GENEROSITY IS ITS OWN FORM OF POWER, ZOE."

00:15:32.724,00:15:34.726,HOW DID YOU FIND ME?
00:15:34.809,00:15:37.019,I FIGURED YOU HAD TO BE IN GOVERNMENT.
00:15:37.103,00:15:38.646,I KEPT GOOGLING TILL I FOUND YOUR PICTURE.
00:15:38.730,00:15:40.440,"THIS WON'T WORK, WHAT YOU'RE DOING."
00:15:40.523,00:15:42.734,IT WAS A ONE-TIME DEAL.
00:15:42.817,00:15:45.695,- YOU DON'T GET TO KEEP COMING BACK FOR MORE. - I'LL GO TO THE POLICE.
00:15:45.779,00:15:48.281,THEY'LL LAUGH IN YOUR FACE. LOOK AT YOU.
00:15:48.364,00:15:52.993,"IF THE POLICE WON'T LISTEN TO ME, I'LL CALL TV STATIONS."
00:15:55.455,00:15:59.500,"DOUGLAS STAMPER, PETER RUSSO, FRANK UNDERWOOD."
00:15:59.584,00:16:02.378,YOU ARE WALKING DOWN A ROAD YOU DO NOT WANT TO WALK DOWN.
00:16:09.093,00:16:11.846,"PLEASE, I WON'T CALL ANYONE."
00:16:13.097,00:16:15.015,BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.
00:16:15.099,00:16:17.644,I DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO. I DON'T HAVE ANYONE I CAN CALL.
00:16:17.727,00:16:20.521,I'VE HAD TO DO THINGS. AND I DON'T WANNA DO IT ANYMORE.
00:16:32.199,00:16:34.953,FIND A PLACE TO STAY AND LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.
00:16:35.035,00:16:37.204,I'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.
00:16:45.755,00:16:47.674,YOU HUNGRY?

00:17:06.860,00:17:08.653,RACHEL.
00:17:12.907,00:17:15.493,"- HOW DO YOU MEAN? - BONDAGE, ORGIES, WATER SPORTS?"
00:17:15.576,00:17:17.370,- NO. DEFINITELY NOT. - NARCOTICS?

00:17:25.127,00:17:28.006,"LOOK, I'M NOT THE WORLD'S BEST DAD, BUT I WOULD NEVER DO THAT."
00:17:28.088,00:17:29.507,FINE. LET'S MOVE ON TO PROSTITUTION.
00:17:29.590,00:17:31.133,HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA TAKE?
00:17:31.217,00:17:32.468,UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.
00:17:32.552,00:17:34.094,I WROTE ALL THIS DOWN.
00:17:34.178,00:17:36.973,"I'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME, CONGRESSMAN."
00:17:37.056,00:17:39.017,I KNOW WHEN I'VE SCRAPED ALL THE SHIT OFF THE SHOE.

00:18:05.919,00:18:07.587,- POWDER OR NEEDLES? - BOTH.
00:18:07.670,00:18:09.088,WOULD ANY OF THESE WOMEN KNOW WHO YOU ARE?
00:18:09.171,00:18:10.924,NO. NONE OF THEM SPOKE ENGLISH.
00:18:11.007,00:18:13.009,AND I NEVER MENTIONED I WAS A CONGRESSMAN.

00:18:33.279,00:18:34.948,DO YOU GET OFF ON THIS OR SOMETHING?
00:18:35.031,00:18:38.785,DOES A DOCTOR ENJOY IT WHEN HE CUPS YOUR BALLS AND ASKS YOU TO COUGH?
00:18:38.868,00:18:40.453,YOU WANNA KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I CAME?
00:18:40.536,00:18:42.329,I HONESTLY DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU WIN.
00:18:42.413,00:18:44.665,"BUT IF YOU DO, WORK WITH ME."
00:18:44.749,00:18:47.376,HOW OFTEN DID YOU SOLICIT PROSTITUTES IN D.C.?
00:18:47.460,00:18:49.837,ONCE EVERY TWO OR THREE MONTHS.
00:18:49.921,00:18:51.589,"SOMETIMES MORE FREQUENTLY, SOMETIMES LESS."
00:18:51.672,00:18:53.340,DO YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE ANY OF THEM WERE UNDERAGE?
00:18:53.424,00:18:55.259,"JESUS! NO. LOOK, THEY WERE MOSTLY HIGH-END."
00:18:55.342,00:18:58.054,- THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WERE 18. - I NEED A FUCKING BREAK!
00:19:07.354,00:19:08.898,"HE'S AN AMATEUR, FRANK."
00:19:08.982,00:19:12.526,"IF I CAN GET UNDER HIS SKIN IN LESS THAN AN HOUR, HOW DO YOU THINK HE'LL HOLD UP UNDER THE PRESS?"
00:19:14.070,00:19:16.196,ALL RIGHT. I'LL SPEAK TO HIM.
00:19:24.747,00:19:26.540,"FRANK, IT'S JUST-- IT'S NOT GONNA WORK."
00:19:26.624,00:19:27.959,I'M GONNA GET CRUCIFIED.
00:19:28.042,00:19:30.586,YOU'LL BE FINE. WE'VE GOT A CRACK TEAM BEHIND YOU.
00:19:30.670,00:19:33.380,IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD THE TEAM IS. WITH MY PAST? COME ON.
00:19:36.050,00:19:37.802,- YOU AGREED TO IT. - I DIDN'T THINK IT THROUGH.
00:19:37.885,00:19:42.306,"WE HAVE TO TACKLE THIS HEAD-ON, OR THE G.O.P. WILL CRUCIFY YOU."
00:19:42.389,00:19:44.517,WE HAVE TO STEAL THEIR AMMUNITION FROM THEM.
00:19:44.600,00:19:47.937,HONESTY IS YOUR BEST DEFENSE AND OFFENSE.
00:19:48.021,00:19:50.523,I'M THE ONE THAT HAS TO GET IN FRONT OF THESE CAMERAS AND SAY THIS SHIT.
00:19:50.606,00:19:52.525,THEY DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT. I DO.
00:19:54.610,00:19:56.195,BUT NOT THIS WAY. I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
00:19:56.278,00:20:00.407,"IF YOU WEREN'T UNSURE NOW, THERE'D BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU."
00:20:00.491,00:20:02.035,I EXPECTED THIS.
00:20:04.162,00:20:07.665,IT'S OKAY TO VACILLATE A LITTLE.
00:20:07.748,00:20:09.500,I'M NOT TRYING TO THROW A WRENCH IN THE WORKS.
00:20:09.583,00:20:11.335,I KNOW YOU'RE NOT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
00:20:11.418,00:20:13.046,YOU TAKE THE REST OF THE DAY OFF.
00:20:13.129,00:20:21.428,"YOU GO BACK TO YOUR OFFICE, YOU CATCH UP WITH WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO CATCH UP ON, YOU GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, YOU GO TO A MEETING TOMORROW, AND THEN YOU COME HERE AND WE'LL TALK THE WHOLE THING THROUGH."
00:20:21.512,00:20:24.015,CAN YOU GIVE ME AT LEAST THAT?
00:20:24.098,00:20:26.017,"YEAH. OKAY, FRANK."
00:20:26.100,00:20:27.768,GOOD.
00:20:47.080,00:20:50.624,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ALL THE LITTLE SCULPTURES?
00:20:50.708,00:20:56.047,I FOUND A FLOWER ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE AND A BIRD ON THE NIGHTSTAND A FEW DAYS AGO.
00:20:57.590,00:20:59.508,IT'S A SWAN.
00:20:59.592,00:21:01.177,YOU MADE THEM?
00:21:01.260,00:21:02.845,YES.
00:21:02.929,00:21:04.764,A NEW HOBBY?
00:21:07.141,00:21:09.393,NO.
00:21:09.476,00:21:11.311,IT'S AN INTEREST.
00:21:20.529,00:21:23.741,MAY I BRING UP SOMETHING ELSE I'VE NOTICED?
00:21:26.535,00:21:29.205,YOU...

00:21:34.252,00:21:37.255,IS THERE A REASON YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT?
00:21:37.337,00:21:39.298,I HAVEN'T FELT THE NEED TO.
00:21:43.594,00:21:46.222,IT'S NOT PLEASANT.
00:21:46.305,00:21:48.724,"BUT, NO, IT'S NOT BAD."
00:21:48.808,00:21:49.850,WHAT CAN I DO?
00:21:52.352,00:21:54.021,NOTHING.
00:21:54.105,00:21:55.940,"IF THERE WAS SOMETHING, I'D ASK."
00:22:07.076,00:22:10.621,- DID YOU THINK IT WAS WEIRD THAT I CALLED YOU? - TOTALLY WEIRD.
00:22:10.704,00:22:14.541,EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT I WAS PLANNING ON CALLING YOU.
00:22:14.625,00:22:16.669,REALLY? WHY?
00:22:16.752,00:22:24.218,"I WAS A REAL GRADE-A BITCH TO YOU AT THE HERALD, AND I ALMOST APOLOGIZED WHEN I SAW YOU AT THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT I CHICKENED OUT."
00:22:24.302,00:22:27.096,"SO, ANYWAY, I AM DRUNK ENOUGH, AND I AM SORRY."
00:22:27.180,00:22:29.307,WHY DID YOU CALL ME?
00:22:29.389,00:22:32.601,I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW THINGS WERE GOING AT THE OLD STOMPING GROUND.
00:22:32.685,00:22:34.728,- HERE YOU GO. - THANK YOU.
00:22:37.148,00:22:40.026,AND I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR DOING WHAT YOU DID.
00:22:40.109,00:22:45.948,BUT THIS NEW GUY? SIX YEARS RUNNING E.W. ONLINE DOES NOT A MANAGING EDITOR MAKE.
00:22:46.032,00:22:49.243,WOULD YOU EVER WANNA COME WORK WITH US?
00:22:49.327,00:22:51.078,"I MEAN, IT'D BE A HUGE FUCKING DEAL."
00:22:51.162,00:22:54.999,CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE HERALD MOVES TO SLUGLINE?
00:22:55.082,00:22:57.001,DID CARLY HEATH PUT YOU UP TO THIS?
00:22:57.084,00:22:58.418,NO. NOT AT ALL.
00:22:58.502,00:23:00.338,"BUT IF YOU WANT, I CAN TALK TO HER."
00:23:00.420,00:23:03.549,YOU THINK SHE WOULD GO FOR IT?
00:23:03.632,00:23:05.634,"HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW."
00:23:05.718,00:23:08.721,SHE'S GOT THIS SORT OF ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT FUCK YOU ATTITUDE.
00:23:08.804,00:23:10.723,CONVENTIONAL NEWS BORES HER.
00:23:10.806,00:23:14.060,BUT IF YOU HAD SOMETHING GRITTY TO SHOW...
00:23:16.145,00:23:18.438,I'VE GOT A STORY IF YOU WANT IT.
00:23:18.522,00:23:19.940,IT'S PRETTY FUCKING GREAT.
00:23:20.024,00:23:21.692,YOU WOULD GIVE AWAY A STORY?
00:23:21.775,00:23:25.154,"IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED-- NO, I'M INTERESTED."
00:23:28.241,00:23:32.078,"IF I SEEM A LITTLE HUNG OVER, IT IS BECAUSE I AM."
00:23:32.161,00:23:34.412,"A LOT HUNG OVER, ACTUALLY."
00:23:34.496,00:23:40.127,"GOD, I ALMOST HAD A COUPLE OF MONTHS, AND THEN LAST NIGHT, I..."
00:23:40.211,00:23:43.339,"WELL, I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH, SO..."
00:23:43.421,00:23:46.133,"BUT ANYWAY, HERE I AM."
00:23:49.095,00:23:51.638,"THANK YOU FOR SHARING, DIANE."
00:23:51.722,00:23:53.473,"I'M DOUG, AND I'M AN ALCOHOLIC."
00:23:57.561,00:24:00.064,ONE OF THE THINGS I DO FOR A LIVING IS COUNT.
00:24:00.147,00:24:01.481,I COUNT VOTES.
00:24:01.565,00:24:04.442,"YEAS, NAYS, NEUTRALS, ABSTAINING."
00:24:04.526,00:24:06.946,AND I'M GOOD AT IT.
00:24:07.029,00:24:09.907,BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT COUNT I DO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WORK.
00:24:14.452,00:24:17.373,"AS OF THIS MORNING, THAT'S 5,185."
00:24:17.455,00:24:24.504,"THE BIGGER THAT NUMBER GETS, THE MORE IT FRIGHTENS ME, BECAUSE I KNOW ALL IT TAKES IS ONE DRINK TO GO BACK TO ZERO."
00:24:24.588,00:24:29.176,MOST PEOPLE SEE FEAR AS A WEAKNESS. IT CAN BE.
00:24:29.260,00:24:33.222,"SOMETIMES FOR MY JOB, I HAVE TO PUT FEAR IN OTHER PEOPLE."
00:24:33.306,00:24:35.224,I KNOW THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
00:24:35.308,00:24:43.649,"BUT IF I'M HONEST, LIKE THE FOURTH STEP ASKS US TO BE, I HAVE TO BE RUTHLESS, BECAUSE FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION."
00:24:43.732,00:24:45.692,THE SAME GOES FOR MY SOBRIETY.
00:24:45.776,00:24:48.446,I HAVE TO BE RUTHLESS WITH MYSELF.
00:24:48.528,00:24:50.448,I HAVE TO USE MY FEAR.
00:24:50.530,00:24:52.325,IT MAKES ME STRONGER.
00:24:52.408,00:24:55.493,"LIKE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM, I CAN'T CONTROL WHO I AM."
00:24:55.577,00:24:57.746,BUT I CAN CONTROL THE ZERO.
00:24:57.830,00:25:00.582,FUCK THE ZERO.
00:25:03.294,00:25:05.463,IT WORKS IF YOU WORK IT.
00:25:10.301,00:25:13.971,"I TRIED TO FIND HIM AFTERWARDS, BUT HE WAS GONE BEFORE I COULD CATCH UP WITH HIM."
00:25:14.054,00:25:17.391,- DID HE SAY ANYTHING? - NO. HE NEVER SHARES. HE LOOKED PREOCCUPIED.
00:25:17.475,00:25:20.144,- YOU THINK HE'LL SHOW UP AT THE HOUSE TODAY? - I HAVE NO IDEA.
00:25:20.227,00:25:21.854,HE'S NOT ANSWERING MY CALLS.
00:25:21.937,00:25:24.940,MINE NEITHER. ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO KNOW?
00:25:26.442,00:25:28.568,I HEAR SILENCE. I DON'T LIKE THAT SOUND.
00:25:28.652,00:25:30.570,SOMETHING CAME UP. I'M HANDLING IT.
00:25:30.654,00:25:33.240,"- SOMETHING SERIOUS? - SERIOUS, BUT SOLVABLE."
00:25:33.324,00:25:36.410,- DO I WANNA KNOW MORE? - I DON'T THINK YOU DO. WE'LL BE OKAY.
00:25:36.494,00:25:39.413,I MIGHT HAVE TO INVOLVE NANCY. I'M HOPING I WON'T HAVE TO.
00:25:39.497,00:25:42.375,"BUT IF I DO, SHE'LL HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING DAMAGING."
00:25:44.460,00:25:46.337,"OF COURSE, SIR."
00:25:49.798,00:25:52.426,CAN THE CONGRESSMAN HAVE A MOMENT?
00:25:55.095,00:25:57.597,THINGS ARE-- THEY'RE COMPLICATED.
00:25:57.681,00:26:00.226,"I REALIZE THAT, BUT HE TRULY NEEDS YOU."
00:26:00.309,00:26:02.102,I DON'T KNOW WHAT I COULD SAY TO HIM.
00:26:02.186,00:26:04.313,I THINK JUST SHOWING UP WOULD DO HIM A WORLD OF GOOD.
00:26:10.568,00:26:15.074,"IN FACT, HE SAID HE'D BE FINE IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE - THE NEXT SIX MONTHS OFF. - WHAT?"
00:26:15.157,00:26:17.326,I WANT YOU TO BE DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER.
00:26:17.410,00:26:19.495,YOU WORK UNDER NASH AARONS.
00:26:26.085,00:26:32.758,"NO. I SPENT YEARS BEING PETER'S CRUTCH. IF YOU JUST WANT ME THERE-- WELL, OF COURSE WE WANT YOU THERE TO HELP, BUT NOT AS A CRUTCH."
00:26:32.841,00:26:36.136,PETER IS A TALENTED YOUNG MAN WITH A LOT OF POTENTIAL.
00:26:36.220,00:26:40.349,"HE KNOWS THIS, BUT HE NEEDS TO HEAR IT FROM SOMEONE OTHER THAN ME."
00:26:40.433,00:26:42.268,SOMEONE HE TRULY CARES ABOUT.
00:26:44.186,00:26:46.522,I'M SORRY. THIS IS JUST A LOT RIGHT NOW.
00:26:46.604,00:26:49.525,"WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION NOW, BUT AT LEAST TALK TO PETER."
00:26:49.607,00:26:51.235,"I MEAN, THERE'S NO HARM IN THAT, NOW, IS THERE?"
00:27:31.525,00:27:32.901,TEN GRAND.
00:27:32.985,00:27:34.987,WE DIVERT IT FROM YOUR CAMPAIGN ACCOUNTS.
00:27:35.070,00:27:37.239,- WE ITEMIZE IT SO IT LOOKS LIKE-- - WAIT.
00:27:37.323,00:27:38.698,YOU WANT ME TO PAY FOR THIS?
00:27:38.782,00:27:40.826,USE FRANK'S REELECTION FUND.
00:27:40.909,00:27:44.622,"COMMISSIONER, THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY THAT YOU'VE RAISED HAS COME FROM PEOPLE WE'VE SENT YOUR WAY."
00:27:44.704,00:27:47.416,AND YOU SENT THEM BECAUSE I SPRUNG YOUR BOY RUSSO IN THE FIRST PLACE.
00:27:47.500,00:27:49.502,WE'RE EVEN. I DON'T OWE YOU SHIT.
00:27:49.585,00:27:52.338,THERE'S A GIRL IN TROUBLE. LET'S HELP HER OUT.
00:27:55.257,00:27:57.468,- NOT MY PROBLEM. - IT COULD BE.
00:27:57.551,00:28:00.304,"WE PUT HER BACK ON THE STREETS, THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT SHE COULD DO."
00:28:00.387,00:28:05.643,I'M A HELL OF A LOT MORE AFRAID OF THE U.S. ATTORNEY THAN I AM OF SOME HOOKER.
00:28:05.725,00:28:08.812,THIS IS A VERY INEXPENSIVE INSURANCE POLICY.
00:28:10.397,00:28:14.443,THERE'S NO FUCKING WAY I'M GONNA MESS WITH CAMPAIGN FINANCE REGULATIONS.
00:28:14.527,00:28:17.613,I DON'T EVEN WANNA BE HEARING THIS SHIT.
00:28:33.546,00:28:35.548,- MR. PRESIDENT. - JIM.
00:28:35.631,00:28:39.468,"AFTER THAT, YOU'VE GOT A MEET AND GREET WITH THE FINALIST-- I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU IN A MINUTE."
00:30:00.257,00:30:01.717,"THIS WAY, SIR."
00:30:18.400,00:30:19.610,HEY.
00:30:19.693,00:30:21.278,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
00:30:21.361,00:30:24.615,THE CONGRESSMAN WANTED ME TO COME OVER.
00:30:27.660,00:30:29.244,- DEPUTY MANAGER. - FRANK!
00:30:31.163,00:30:33.457,HE SAID YOU'RE HAVING SOME DOUBTS.
00:30:38.629,00:30:41.507,I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TELL HIM THAT I DECIDED NOT TO RUN.
00:30:41.590,00:30:42.758,OH.
00:30:51.850,00:30:54.687,DID HE TELL YOU ABOUT THE WHOLE PLAN? ABOUT COMING CLEAN?
00:30:54.770,00:30:56.480,"YEAH, HE DID."
00:30:56.563,00:31:00.567,I HAVE KEVIN AND SARAH TO THINK ABOUT.
00:31:00.651,00:31:02.778,- EVERYONE HAS A PAST. - NOT LIKE MINE.
00:31:02.861,00:31:04.863,"YOU DON'T KNOW HALF THE THINGS I'VE DONE, CHRISTINA."
00:31:04.946,00:31:08.074,MY KIDS READ. THEIR FRIENDS READ. I CAN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.
00:31:08.158,00:31:11.328,"LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANNA RUN, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T."
00:31:15.874,00:31:20.920,"THEN MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING-- CONFRONTING YOUR PAST, EVEN FOR YOUR KIDS."
00:31:21.004,00:31:23.507,THEY'RE A LOT STRONGER THAN YOU GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR.
00:31:25.509,00:31:33.141,"LOOK, IF UNDERWOOD, IF THE D.N.C., IF THEY ALL THINK YOU CAN DO IT, THEN-- I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK. I CARE WHAT YOU THINK."
00:31:34.893,00:31:36.729,I THINK YOU'D BE GREAT.
00:31:40.106,00:31:43.777,"- SO, SHE REALLY WANTS THIS? - THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I GOT."
00:31:43.861,00:31:46.739,WHAT ABOUT EGO? I DON'T NEED TO BE DEALING WITH A DIVA.
00:31:46.822,00:31:50.743,"SHE'S NOT A DIVA, SHE'S AN AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST WITH 15 YEARS' EXPERIENCE."
00:31:50.826,00:31:52.285,YOU TOLD ME SHE TREATED YOU LIKE SHIT.
00:31:52.369,00:31:53.871,THERE WAS SOME FRICTION.
00:31:53.953,00:31:55.748,SO WHY ARE YOU GOING TO BAT FOR HER?
00:31:55.831,00:31:57.416,DON'T WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE BEST PEOPLE?
00:31:57.499,00:31:59.042,"PLUS, IT'D BE BIG FOR THE SITE."
00:31:59.125,00:32:00.960,THE HERALD'S SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER?
00:32:01.044,00:32:03.422,"SURE, BUT SHE'S SO OLD GUARD. EVERYTHING'S BY THE BOOK."
00:32:06.299,00:32:08.218,- IT'S GOT SERIOUS BITE. - WHAT IS IT?
00:32:08.301,00:32:11.805,SHE CAN TELL YOU HERSELF. YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER.
00:32:23.817,00:32:25.611,"SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH."
00:32:27.028,00:32:29.072,HERE'S THE DEAL.
00:32:29.155,00:32:32.284,MY CHILDREN STAY OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT.
00:32:32.367,00:32:35.579,"NO PHOTO OPS, NO PRESS."
00:32:35.662,00:32:38.331,WE WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT.
00:32:41.418,00:32:43.837,OKAY.
00:32:43.921,00:32:46.465,LET'S DO THIS.
00:33:28.381,00:33:31.176,SIT DOWN.
00:33:47.567,00:33:50.278,- WHERE YOU FROM? - OUTSIDE OF LYNCHBURG.
00:33:52.906,00:33:55.367,- ARE YOUR PARENTS STILL LIVING THERE? - NO. I CAN'T.
00:34:06.419,00:34:08.505,- WHAT KIND OF PLACE? - A NICE PLACE.
00:34:08.588,00:34:12.091,A SAFE PLACE UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT SOMETHING PERMANENT.
00:34:13.927,00:34:18.181,BUT I NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU WON'T PULL ANYTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN.
00:34:18.264,00:34:20.183,PROMISE ME.
00:34:20.266,00:34:21.351,I PROMISE.
00:34:21.434,00:34:23.770,LOOK AT ME WHEN YOU SAY IT.
00:34:25.689,00:34:26.940,I PROMISE YOU.
00:34:31.653,00:34:33.488,HOW YOU DOING ON MONEY?
00:34:33.572,00:34:35.114,I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR TOMORROW.
00:34:49.713,00:34:51.381,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
00:34:54.593,00:34:58.013,- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME TO-- - YOU SAID YOU WERE DONE WITH THAT.
00:35:08.857,00:35:11.026,I'LL BE IN TOUCH.
00:35:17.699,00:35:22.245,"IF YOU OWN UP TO SOME OF THE SHENANIGANS, SWEEP THE REST UNDER THE RUG, YOU MIGHT HAVE A SHOT."
00:35:22.328,00:35:24.957,HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE TO SWEEP UNDER?
00:35:25.040,00:35:27.960,"WELL, THE KID HAD A TALENT FOR COVERING HIS TRACKS."
00:35:28.043,00:35:31.170,I'VE HIGHLIGHTED ALL THE ITEMS I THINK HE SHOULD ADMIT TO.
00:35:31.254,00:35:32.798,THE REST I WOULDN'T MENTION.
00:35:32.881,00:35:34.967,IT'S A LOT NOT TO TALK ABOUT.
00:35:40.931,00:35:42.724,- I NEED YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING. - RIGHT NOW?
00:35:42.808,00:35:44.726,- YES. - IS IT IMPORTANT?
00:35:44.810,00:35:48.897,BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME I COULD LEAVE EARLY THIS WEEKEND TO GO VISIT MY DAUGHTER DOWN IN VIRGINIA.
00:35:48.981,00:35:50.941,"YOU HAVE A GUEST ROOM IN YOUR HOUSE, RIGHT?"
00:35:51.024,00:35:53.151,"WELL, IT'S MARY'S OLD ROOM, BUT, YES."
00:35:53.234,00:35:55.737,I NEED YOU TO PUT SOMEONE UP FOR A WHILE. A YOUNG WOMAN.
00:35:55.821,00:35:58.115,- WHAT? WHO? - HER NAME IS RACHEL.
00:35:58.197,00:35:59.783,I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE THAN THAT.
00:35:59.866,00:36:04.830,"I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY DO YOU NEED-- NO QUESTIONS, NANCY. I JUST NEED YOU TO DO THIS FOR ME."
00:36:04.913,00:36:06.999,I WOULDN'T BE ASKING IF IT WEREN'T SERIOUS.
00:36:07.082,00:36:08.416,PUT HER UP FOR HOW LONG?
00:36:08.500,00:36:11.086,I DON'T KNOW. IT COULD BE A WHILE.
00:36:11.169,00:36:13.964,I'M SUPPOSED TO PUT UP A COMPLETE STRANGER AND NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS?
00:36:14.047,00:36:17.050,"NANCY, PLEASE. YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON I CAN TRUST."
00:36:17.134,00:36:18.844,IS SOMETHING ILLEGAL GOING ON?
00:36:18.927,00:36:21.387,NO. SHE'S JUST A GIRL IN TROUBLE WHO NEEDS A PLACE TO STAY.
00:36:21.471,00:36:24.223,- WE HAVE TO BE DISCREET. - CAN I AT LEAST MEET HER FIRST?
00:36:24.307,00:36:26.351,I NEED TO KNOW NOW.
00:36:26.434,00:36:29.604,"OKAY, I GUESS."
00:36:30.939,00:36:33.441,THANK YOU.
00:36:36.945,00:36:38.864,"THERE'S NO CATCH, LARRY."
00:36:38.947,00:36:42.283,YOUR DISTRICT GETS OVER 20 MILLION IF THE NUMBERS HOLD.
00:36:44.161,00:36:48.206,"AND MOST OF THE MONEY IS EARMARKED FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, NOT RESEARCH."
00:36:48.289,00:36:50.876,"THAT'S GREAT, BUT I NEED MORE THAN YOUR SUPPORT."
00:36:50.959,00:36:52.585,I NEED YOU TO BE A SPONSOR.
00:36:54.880,00:36:56.715,"FANTASTIC, LARRY."
00:36:56.798,00:36:59.217,GREAT. I'LL PUT YOU DOWN.
00:36:59.300,00:37:01.260,"YOU, TOO. BYE."
00:37:01.344,00:37:05.015,SO THAT JUST LEAVES CLAYBURN... AND PRICE?
00:37:05.098,00:37:07.726,- WITH JENNINGS ON THE FENCE. - AND I KNOW ROGER. I'LL CALL HIM.
00:37:07.809,00:37:09.936,AND I'LL TRACK DOWN THESE OTHER TWO OVER THE WEEKEND.
00:37:10.020,00:37:12.147,"REALLY GOOD WORK TODAY, PETER."
00:37:15.734,00:37:17.652,DO YOU KNOW WHERE I PUT MY PURSE?
00:37:17.736,00:37:19.821,- IT'S RIGHT HERE. - OH.
00:37:19.905,00:37:22.741,DID YOU MAKE THOSE? I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO PRY.
00:37:22.824,00:37:26.119,"OH, THIS? I'VE BEEN FOOLING AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE BIT."
00:37:26.203,00:37:29.956,CAN I SEE? SARAH LEARNED HOW TO MAKE THESE BIRDS IN HER ART CLASS.
00:37:30.040,00:37:34.419,"THEN SHE TAUGHT IT TO KEVIN, AND THEY GOT OBSESSED, AND THERE WERE LITTLE PIECES OF PAPER ALL OVER THE APARTMENT."
00:37:34.502,00:37:36.963,"- DO YOU WANNA TAKE THEM FOR THE KIDS? - OH, NO. I CAN'T."
00:37:37.047,00:37:39.966,"OH, PLEASE. I'LL JUST THROW THEM OUT, EVENTUALLY."
00:37:40.050,00:37:42.301,THANK YOU. THEY'LL LOVE THEM.
00:37:42.385,00:37:46.014,SO YOU SHOULD BRING THE KIDS BY THE HOUSE SOMETIME SO I CAN MEET THEM.
00:37:46.098,00:37:48.725,KEVIN AND FRANK CAN PLAY THE VIDEO GAMES.
00:37:48.808,00:37:51.310,"- HE TOLD YOU THAT? - I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED, I HAVE TO ADMIT."
00:37:51.394,00:37:56.608,IF ANYBODY KNEW HE CAME HOME EVERY DAY TO-- - IT'S EMBARRASSING. - THERE'S WORSE SECRETS TO HAVE.
00:37:56.691,00:37:58.735,"YEAH, THERE ARE, I SUPPOSE."
00:38:01.113,00:38:03.782,I'LL CALL YOU MONDAY AFTER I TALK TO CLAYBURN AND PRICE.
00:38:03.865,00:38:05.784,"OKAY, GREAT. HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND, PETER."
00:38:05.867,00:38:07.702,"YOU, TOO."
00:38:09.704,00:38:11.998,I HAD LINDA TALK TO THE VICE PRESIDENT.
00:38:12.082,00:38:14.542,- HE'LL KEEP HIS NOSE OUT OF IT. - I APPRECIATE THAT.
00:38:17.796,00:38:19.798,"- YOU START SPREADING DOUBTS, AND-- - HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS."
00:38:19.881,00:38:22.508,"WE ALL KNOW IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO MINCE WORDS, FRANK."
00:38:22.592,00:38:26.554,"I HAVE TO SAY, SIR, THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS A POINT."
00:38:26.638,00:38:29.599,I'M NOT 100% SOLD ON RUSSO.
00:38:29.682,00:38:32.227,DO WE REALLY WANNA GO WITH SOMEONE THIS UNTESTED?
00:38:34.938,00:38:36.606,- WHEN DO YOU ANNOUNCE? - NEXT MONTH.
00:38:38.984,00:38:42.445,I WAS WONDERING THE SAME THING. THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH TO SEE.
00:38:45.991,00:38:50.120,WHAT I SEE IS A RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC WITH A HISTORY OF DRUG ABUSE.
00:38:50.203,00:38:52.664,"- WHAT? - EXCUSE ME, FRANK?"
00:38:52.747,00:38:54.707,BUT HE'S CLEAN NOW. HAS BEEN FOR A YEAR.
00:38:54.791,00:38:57.127,"THIS IS A REDEMPTION STORY, MR. PRESIDENT."
00:38:57.210,00:38:59.754,THIS IS A BRIGHT YOUNG MAN WHO'S PUT HIS LIFE BACK ON TRACK.
00:38:59.838,00:39:02.048,NOW HE WANTS TO HELP PUT PENNSYLVANIA BACK ON TRACK.
00:39:02.132,00:39:09.139,"- DRUGS, FRANK? - PEOPLE LOVE AN UNDERDOG, LINDA, AND PEOPLE LOVE SOMEONE WHO STANDS UP AFTER THEY'VE FALLEN."
00:39:09.222,00:39:11.850,"COMBINE THOSE TWO, IT'S A VERY POWERFUL NARRATIVE."
00:39:11.933,00:39:13.935,ALL OF OUR POLLING INDICATES THIS IS GONNA WORK.
00:39:14.019,00:39:16.104,YOU WANT US TO ENDORSE SOMEONE WITH A HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE?
00:39:16.188,00:39:19.149,LET US GET HIS STORY OUT THERE AND WATCH IT CONNECT WITH THE VOTERS.
00:39:19.232,00:39:20.775,"ALL I CARE ABOUT IS A WIN, FRANK."
00:39:22.777,00:39:33.163,"THIS IS NOT A HAIL MARY, MR. PRESIDENT, - THIS IS A WELL-THOUGHT-OUT GAME PLAN. - MR. PRESIDENT-- BUT THE LAST TIME I DID, WE SIGNED AN EDUCATION BILL."
00:39:37.292,00:39:40.295,ALL RIGHT. WE WON'T STAND IN YOUR WAY.
00:39:40.378,00:39:43.589,"- BUT IF IT BACKFIRES, FRANK-- - I'LL GUIDE PETER EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY."
00:39:43.673,00:39:45.466,"WE WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU, MR. PRESIDENT."
00:39:45.550,00:39:46.801,OKAY.
00:39:48.053,00:39:49.428,"THANK YOU, SIR."
00:39:49.512,00:39:51.472,LINDA.
00:39:51.556,00:39:56.602,"I DIDN'T PLAN ON TELLING THEM SO MUCH SO SOON, BUT IF I DIDN'T, LINDA WOULD'VE SWAYED HIM."
00:39:56.686,00:40:01.149,THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO OVERPOWER A TRICKLE OF DOUBT THAN WITH A FLOOD OF NAKED TRUTH.
00:40:01.233,00:40:03.360,THIS IS WHY THE EDUCATION BILL WAS SO IMPORTANT.
00:40:03.442,00:40:06.905,IT BOUGHT ME INFLUENCE PRECISELY WHEN I NEEDED IT MOST.
00:40:12.911,00:40:14.704,A LONG TIME. SINCE I WAS A KID.
00:40:14.787,00:40:16.998,HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU HAD YOUR FIRST DRINK?
00:40:17.082,00:40:19.167,- NINE. - NINE YEARS OLD?
00:40:19.251,00:40:21.544,YEAH. MY DAD GAVE ME A BEER FOR MY NINTH BIRTHDAY.
00:40:24.172,00:40:34.349,"I WON'T GO INTO TOO MANY SPECIFICS OTHER THAN TO SAY I HAD A FEW MINOR BRUSHES WITH MARIJUANA AND COCAINE IN THE PAST BUT NOT RECENTLY, AND ONLY A HANDFUL OF TIMES."
00:40:34.432,00:40:36.976,NO OTHER DRUGS BESIDES MARIJUANA AND COCAINE?
00:40:37.060,00:40:38.603,NO.
00:40:38.686,00:40:40.563,UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?
00:40:40.646,00:40:43.191,OCCASIONAL SOCIAL GATHERINGS. THAT'S THE MOST I'LL SAY.
00:40:43.275,00:40:44.984,EVER WHILE YOU WERE IN PUBLIC OFFICE?
00:40:45.068,00:40:47.404,NO. NEVER. MY CHIEF PROBLEM WAS ALCOHOL.
00:40:47.486,00:40:51.824,AND YOU'VE BEEN SOBER HOW LONG NOW?
00:40:51.908,00:40:54.660,- A LITTLE OVER A YEAR. - AND WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO GET SOBER?
00:40:56.579,00:41:04.963,"TWO THINGS. MY CHILDREN, WHOM I LOVE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD, AND MY RENEWED FAITH IN GOD."
00:41:21.729,00:41:23.064,ZOE.
00:41:24.232,00:41:25.733,LUCAS.
00:41:25.817,00:41:31.072,"I WAS JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I THOUGHT..."
00:41:31.156,00:41:34.659,NO. THAT'S A LIE. I WAS AT THE BAR AROUND THE CORNER.
00:41:34.742,00:41:36.702,"THE ONE WITH THE, UH..."
00:41:36.786,00:41:41.374,AND I REMEMBERED THAT TIME THAT I DROPPED YOU OFF AFTER WORK.
00:41:41.458,00:41:43.835,I KNEW IT WAS...
00:41:43.918,00:41:45.586,THIS BLOCK.
00:41:47.797,00:41:53.345,"AND I, UH, BUZZED, AND THEN I WAITED-- - YOU'RE WASTED. - I'M PRETTY WASTED."
00:42:06.107,00:42:10.778,"DO YOU WANNA KNOW A DEEP, DARK SECRET?"
00:42:23.124,00:42:27.586,NOW WE DON'T WORK TOGETHER...
00:42:29.547,00:42:31.383,ANYMORE.
00:42:47.065,00:42:49.192,LUCAS...
00:42:49.275,00:42:51.403,I'M REALLY FLATTERED.
00:42:52.904,00:42:58.784,BUT I'M JUST NOT IN A PLACE WHERE I'M EVEN THINKING ROMANTICALLY RIGHT NOW.
00:43:02.914,00:43:06.167,"I'M SORRY. I, UH..."
00:43:08.211,00:43:10.046,YEAH.
00:43:13.174,00:43:15.093,"HEY, HEY!"
00:43:39.242,00:43:41.411,"YOU WANT ME TO PULL UP NOW, SIR?"
00:44:10.231,00:44:12.066,I STILL HAVE MY KEY.
00:44:50.271,00:44:52.898,I'LL BE IN THE KITCHEN IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
00:44:52.982,00:44:54.817,THANK YOU.
00:45:31.896,00:45:35.066,"HEY, I GOT US WINE, BUT I CAN'T FIND A CORKSCREW ANYWHERE."
00:45:35.149,00:45:37.151,GIVE IT TO ME.
00:45:38.319,00:45:40.154,I NEED A PEN.
00:45:42.699,00:45:45.159,- THE PEN THE PRESIDENT GAVE YOU? - THAT'LL WORK.
00:45:57.213,00:45:58.715,DID YOU TALK TO MS. SKORSKY?
00:45:58.797,00:46:01.842,I DID. SHE SAID IT WAS INTENSE.
00:46:01.926,00:46:04.303,I THINK CARLY'S GONNA OFFER HER A JOB AT SLUGLINE.
00:46:04.387,00:46:07.056,- WAS THAT YOUR DOING? - JANINE EXPRESSED INTEREST.
00:46:07.139,00:46:09.392,I TOOK THE NEXT STEP.
00:46:09.475,00:46:12.769,WELL DONE. ALWAYS GOOD TO BE OWED FAVORS.
00:46:14.647,00:46:17.983,I WAS WONDERING. DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT MY AGE?
00:46:18.067,00:46:20.403,NO. DOES MY AGE BOTHER YOU?
00:46:20.486,00:46:23.698,YOU MUST HAVE OTHER LOVERS-- MEN THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN ME.
00:46:25.491,00:46:27.868,"I AM MARRIED, AFTER ALL."
00:46:27.952,00:46:31.581,I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR OTHER LOVERS.
00:46:31.664,00:46:33.082,MM.
00:46:35.918,00:46:37.545,MM. SHIT.
00:46:37.629,00:46:39.714,IT'S TURNED. GIVE ME THAT.
00:46:39.796,00:46:40.923,MM.
00:46:58.274,00:47:02.861,"I HAVE ASKED THE SUPER TO GET AN EXTERMINATOR IN HERE, AND HE WON'T DO IT."
00:47:02.945,00:47:08.075,"SO ANYTIME I SEE A COCKROACH OR A SPIDER, OR WHATEVER, I TRY AND TRAP IT, AND THEN I LEAVE IT BY HIS DOOR."
00:47:08.159,00:47:10.953,YOU REALLY OUGHT TO GET YOUR PARENTS TO LET YOU BORROW SOME MONEY.
00:47:11.036,00:47:12.871,THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE IN THE THIRD WORLD.
00:47:12.955,00:47:14.999,I WOULD NEVER TAKE MONEY FROM THEM.
00:47:15.082,00:47:17.710,"BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE IT, OR BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT IT?"
00:47:17.794,00:47:20.004,BECAUSE I DON'T WANT IT.
00:47:20.087,00:47:22.047,"IT'S FATHER'S DAY, YOU KNOW."
00:47:22.131,00:47:23.675,IT IS?
00:47:23.758,00:47:25.176,YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR FATHER.
00:47:25.259,00:47:27.219,I'LL CALL HIM TOMORROW.
00:47:27.303,00:47:32.057,TOMORROW YOU'LL BE THE DAUGHTER THAT FORGOT FATHER'S DAY INSTEAD OF THE ONE WHO REMEMBERED.
00:47:32.141,00:47:34.435,GO AHEAD. CALL HIM.
00:47:44.821,00:47:48.115,"HEY, DAD. SORRY IT'S SO LATE."
00:47:48.199,00:47:50.951,'CAUSE YOU WEREN'T HOME THE LAST TIME I CALLED HER.
00:47:51.035,00:47:54.664,"THERE'S SO LITTLE SHE'LL EVER REVEAL TO ME, OR I TO HER."
00:47:56.873,00:47:59.544,I'M SURE SHE'S SPEAKING HALF AN OCTAVE HIGHER.
00:47:59.627,00:48:01.796,SAME VOICE SHE HAD WHEN SHE WAS 16.
00:48:01.878,00:48:07.259,"TELLING HIM ALL ABOUT HER NEW JOB, HOW MUCH SHE MISSES HIM, AND SORRY SHE DIDN'T SEND A CARD."
00:48:07.343,00:48:10.095,TELLING HIM EVERYTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
00:48:10.179,00:48:13.349,JUST LIKE SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME ABOUT THAT YOUNG MAN DOWNSTAIRS.
00:48:14.975,00:48:16.561,DON'T MAKE ME FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.
00:48:16.644,00:48:19.230,IT WAS THE BEST THING THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED.
00:48:19.313,00:48:21.065,I DIDN'T FIT IN THERE.
00:48:21.148,00:48:23.776,"I'VE BEEN CALLED WORSE, DAD."
00:48:23.860,00:48:26.195,THERE'S A VALUE IN HAVING SECRETS.
00:48:26.278,00:48:31.325,"CREATURES LIKE MYSELF, LIKE CLAIRE, LIKE ZOE-- WE WOULDN'T BE OURSELVES WITHOUT THEM."
00:48:31.409,00:48:35.580,"BUT PETER RUSSO, ON THE OTHER HAND-- HE'S TRAPPED BY HIS SECRETS."
00:48:35.663,00:48:39.166,WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SET HIMSELF FREE.
00:48:43.295,00:48:45.047,I DON'T KNOW YET.
00:48:45.130,00:48:49.218,"AFTER ALL, WE ARE NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN WHAT WE CHOOSE TO REVEAL."
00:48:49.301,00:48:54.265,"WHAT I AM TO CLAIRE IS NOT WHAT I AM TO ZOE, JUST AS ZOE IS NOT TO ME WHAT SHE IS TO HER FATHER."
00:48:59.645,00:49:01.773,PROBABLY THANKSGIVING.
00:49:04.941,00:49:08.279,'CAUSE I DON'T THINK I CAN MAKE IT BACK BEFORE THEN.
00:49:18.289,00:49:19.998,OKAY. I'LL TRY.
00:49:23.502,00:49:25.296,I SAID I'LL TRY.
00:49:32.428,00:49:33.679,MM-MM.
00:49:36.223,00:49:39.811,NO. I'M NOT SEEING ANYONE RIGHT NOW.
00:49:39.894,00:49:41.437,I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.
00:49:44.941,00:49:47.109,BECAUSE I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THAT.
00:49:49.904,00:49:52.657,"I WOULD TELL YOU, DAD. UH-HUH."
00:49:52.740,00:49:54.533,YEAH.
00:49:57.829,00:49:59.956,OKAY.
00:50:02.458,00:50:04.168,DON'T BE WORRIED ABOUT ME.
00:50:04.251,00:50:05.711,I'M FINE.
00:50:06.963,00:50:08.297,YEAH.
00:50:09.590,00:50:12.635,"DAD, I'M IN..."
00:50:12.718,00:50:14.929,I'M IN A REALLY GREAT PLACE RIGHT NOW.
00:50:23.312,00:50:24.897,I'M GONNA TRY.
00:50:27.274,00:50:28.818,"I'M GONNA TRY TO COME, OKAY?"
00:50:33.489,00:50:35.031,HAPPY FATHER'S DAY.
00:50:54.301,00:50:57.471,AREN'T YOU GONNA WISH ME A HAPPY FATHER'S DAY?
00:50:57.555,00:50:59.390,YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN.
00:51:00.599,00:51:02.434,DON'T I?
00:01:57.993,00:02:03.457,"NOW, MIND YOU, THE WHOLE COLLECTION COULD PROBABLY FIT ON A KINDLE, BUT AT LEAST THE CADETS WILL HAVE ANOTHER PLACE TO GET OUT OF THE RAIN."
00:02:03.540,00:02:05.000,DID YOU HAVE ANY INPUT ON THE DESIGN?
00:02:05.084,00:02:06.543,I APPROVED THE BLUEPRINTS.
00:02:06.627,00:02:09.838,"IF SOMETHING'S GONNA HAVE MY NAME ON IT, I WANT TO MAKE DAMN SURE THEY BUILD IT RIGHT."
00:02:09.922,00:02:12.549,I THINK MY HUSBAND FANCIES HIMSELF A BIT OF AN ARCHITECT.
00:02:12.633,00:02:14.509,"WELL, JEFFERSON DESIGNED MONTICELLO."
00:02:14.593,00:02:16.177,AND HE ALSO FUCKED HIS SLAVES.
00:02:16.261,00:02:20.140,"LUCKILY, I DON'T HAVE ANY, SO THAT PARTICULAR TEMPTATION HASN'T PRESENTED ITSELF."
00:02:22.142,00:02:25.938,THE SENTINEL-- SOUTH CAROLINA'S PREMIERE MILITARY COLLEGE.
00:02:26.021,00:02:29.149,"THEY TAUGHT ME THE VALUES OF HONOR, DUTY, AND RESPECT."
00:02:29.232,00:02:36.573,"THEY ALSO HAZED ME, TRIED TO BREAK ME, AND, SENIOR YEAR, NEARLY EXPELLED ME WHEN I VOLUNTEERED FOR A SENATE RACE AND MY STUDIES SUFFERED."
00:02:36.657,00:02:41.620,BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP THEM FROM SOLICITING A HEFTY SUM FOR THEIR NEW LIBRARY 30 YEARS LATER.
00:02:41.703,00:02:45.666,HOW QUICKLY POOR GRADES ARE FORGOTTEN IN THE SHADOW OF POWER AND WEALTH.
00:02:45.749,00:02:50.045,"YOUR DRINK IS ONLY ABOUT HALF AS FULL AS IT SHOULD BE, FRANK."
00:02:50.129,00:02:51.922,ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME DRUNK?
00:02:52.006,00:02:55.968,"DRUNK, PASSED OUT IN THE GUTTER, SO I CAN STEAL YOUR WIFE."
00:02:56.051,00:02:58.762,DID YOU GET THE E-MAIL ABOUT THE RIFLEMEN?
00:02:58.846,00:03:00.848,- WHAT E-MAIL? - FROM MY OFFICE ABOUT THE INVITATIONS.
00:03:00.931,00:03:02.016,I WAS HOPING THEY WOULD BE HERE.
00:03:02.099,00:03:04.726,"I'LL CHECK THE LIST, BUT I DON'T REMEMBER ANY EMAIL."
00:03:04.810,00:03:06.895,"OH, NOT A PROBLEM. I WAS JUST WONDERING."
00:03:06.979,00:03:08.355,"WELL, SHIT, FRANK, I'M SORRY."
00:03:08.438,00:03:09.982,DON'T YOU SWEAT IT FOR A SECOND.
00:03:10.065,00:03:13.152,"IN FACT, HERE'S HOW YOU CAN MAKE IT UP TO ME-- FRESHEN MY DRINK."
00:03:13.234,00:03:14.611,THAT I CAN DO.
00:03:41.930,00:03:43.932,"CONGRATULATIONS, CONGRESSMAN."
00:03:44.016,00:03:46.768,REMY. NICE TO SEE YOU HERE.
00:03:46.852,00:03:49.437,GERRY AND ALL THE FOLKS AT SANCORP GIVE YOU THEIR REGARDS.
00:03:49.521,00:03:50.898,"WELL, I'M SORRY THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT."
00:03:50.981,00:03:52.024,WHERE'S CLAIRE?
00:03:52.107,00:03:54.818,"OH, SHE'S HERE SOMEWHERE, FENDING OFF ADMIRERS."
00:03:54.902,00:03:57.946,SANCORP WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED SHE TURNED DOWN THEIR DONATION.
00:03:58.030,00:03:59.198,I CAN IMAGINE.
00:03:59.280,00:04:02.951,AND THEY'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT PETER RUSSO RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR.
00:04:04.536,00:04:06.121,"NOW, HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?"
00:04:06.205,00:04:09.541,THREE QUARTERS OF PENNSYLVANIA SITS ON TOP OF THE MARCELLUS SHALE.
00:04:09.624,00:04:13.628,"IF I CAN'T FIND OUT WHO'S RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR, I DON'T DESERVE A DIME OF WHAT THEY'RE PAYING ME."
00:04:13.712,00:04:17.257,THIS WATERSHED BILL RUSSO SPONSORS PLACES A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS ON DRILLING.
00:04:17.340,00:04:20.427,"REMY, CONGRESS IS IN RECESS, AND THIS WEEKEND IS NOT ABOUT WORK."
00:04:20.510,00:04:22.637,I APOLOGIZE. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
00:04:22.721,00:04:24.472,IS SANCORP YOUR ONLY ACCOUNT?
00:04:24.556,00:04:26.725,I HAVE PLENTY.
00:04:26.808,00:04:29.978,BUT MY OTHER CLIENTS DIDN'T PAY FOR YOUR LIBRARY OR MY PLANE TICKET DOWN HERE.
00:04:30.062,00:04:31.563,IT'S A NICE LITTLE JUNKET FOR YOU.
00:04:31.646,00:04:33.648,I DO HOPE YOU'RE TAKING IN THE SIGHTS.
00:04:33.732,00:04:35.400,THIS ISN'T MY FIRST TRIP TO CHARLESTON.
00:04:35.483,00:04:38.486,BUT I'LL BET IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME NOT AS MY PRESS SECRETARY.
00:04:38.570,00:04:39.863,IT IS.
00:04:39.947,00:04:41.364,WHO ELSE DO YOU HAVE COMING IN?
00:04:41.448,00:04:43.450,I DIDN'T WANT TO PACK TONIGHT TOO MUCH.
00:04:43.533,00:04:46.703,"YOU KNOW, THESE RECEPTIONS ARE USUALLY JUST FOR THE MONEY PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF."
00:04:49.372,00:04:56.213,"NORMALLY, THIS IS WHERE I WOULD START TO DRONE ON ABOUT THE SENTINEL'S HISTORY, ITS PHILOSOPHY, ITS YADDA, YADDA, YADDA."
00:04:58.548,00:05:02.510,"FOR MY BIG SPEECH TOMORROW, AND THAT WAY I'M NOT GONNA BORE Y'ALL TO TEARS TWICE."
00:05:02.594,00:05:08.934,"TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO A MAN WHO NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW WHAT A SON OF A BITCH HE IS."
00:05:11.019,00:05:15.482,FRANK UNDERWOOD EXEMPLIFIES ALL THE VIRTUES WE TRY TO INSTILL IN OUR GRADUATES.
00:05:15.565,00:05:22.239,"WE'RE SO PROUD TO CALL YOU AN ALUMNUS, FRANK, AND TO HAVE YOUR NAME AS A PERMANENT FIXTURE ON OUR CAMPUS."
00:05:22.322,00:05:24.950,CONGRESSMAN FRANK UNDERWOOD!
00:05:40.632,00:05:42.634,"THANK YOU, PRESIDENT HIGGINS."
00:05:42.717,00:05:47.931,I FIRST WANT TO THANK SANCORP INDUSTRIES FOR PROVIDING THE FUNDS TO MAKE THE LIBRARY POSSIBLE.
00:05:48.015,00:05:53.854,"WHEN I MATRICULATED HERE AS A YOUNG CADET, JIMMY CARTER HAD JUST BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT."
00:05:53.937,00:05:59.276,"AFTER I GRADUATED, I WISHED THAT I COULD HAVE HAD ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, JUST LIKE JIMMY."
00:05:59.358,00:06:00.986,"WELL, NEITHER OF US GOT OUR WISH."
00:06:01.069,00:06:03.864,BUT I LEFT THIS CAMPUS WITH FOND MEMORIES.
00:06:03.947,00:06:15.959,THE FIRST TIME I EVER-- I GOT YOUR DAMN E-MAIL.
00:06:54.956,00:07:04.174,"WHEN SHE STEPPED OUT IN THE-- TRYING ON THE BRA ON HOUSEWIVES OF ATLANTA, AND I TEASED YOU ABOUT THAT, AND I SAID-- I CALLED IT THE HONEY CHILD, BECAUSE SHE'S THE HONEY CHILD NOW."
00:07:07.426,00:07:09.930,"I DON'T KNOW. A MONTH, MAYBE."
00:07:10.013,00:07:11.348,AND NOBODY'S COME TO FIX IT?
00:07:11.431,00:07:12.849,NOBODY DON'T FIX NOTHING AROUND HERE.
00:07:14.226,00:07:16.728,SHH. I'M WATCHING.
00:07:20.190,00:07:21.942,LEAVE IT ALONE. I'M USED TO IT NOW.

00:07:47.342,00:07:51.721,I'M GOING TO TALK TO THE SHIPBUILDERS ABOUT A PLAN TO BRING THEIR JOBS BACK SO THEY'LL SUPPORT ME IN THE ELECTION.
00:07:51.805,00:07:53.265,I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT STUFF.
00:07:53.348,00:07:54.474,IT'S OVER MY HEAD.
00:07:58.770,00:08:04.234,"OKAY, LISTEN, THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME STORIES COMING OUT ABOUT ME IN THE NEWS-- ABOUT MY PAST."
00:08:04.318,00:08:07.321,I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A HEADS-UP SO IT DOESN'T CATCH YOU OFF GUARD.
00:08:07.404,00:08:09.072,I DON'T WATCH THE NEWS NO MORE. A BUNCH OF GARBAGE.
00:08:11.408,00:08:13.201,YOU WANT TO SEE SOME PICTURES OF KEVIN AND SARAH?
00:08:13.285,00:08:14.995,TOO DARK TO LOOK AT PICTURES.
00:08:15.078,00:08:19.291,"NO, NO, NO. IT'S ON MY PHONE. YOU DON'T NEED ANY-- GET IT AWAY FROM ME. I HATE THOSE THINGS."
00:08:19.374,00:08:20.792,BRAIN CANCER.

00:08:53.283,00:08:54.701,AND THE THING TOOK A DUMP.
00:08:54.784,00:09:01.041,"RIGHT. AND THEY COULDN'T GET IT BACK-- YOU CAN GET A COW UP THREE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS, BUT YOU CAN'T GET IT DOWN."
00:09:01.124,00:09:05.086,AND THAT'S WHY ANDY SAID-- WHO WANTS STEAK FOR DINNER?
00:09:06.546,00:09:07.922,- HOW ARE YOU BOYS DOING? - WE'RE GOOD.

00:09:16.014,00:09:17.807,SHE SAID YOU'RE CHUBBY.

00:09:20.977,00:09:24.272,"- I LOVE THIS WOMAN. - YEAH, SHE-- DON'T LET HIM GET INTO TOO MUCH TROUBLE."
00:09:24.356,00:09:27.150,THEY'LL HAVE GROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH HIM.
00:09:28.651,00:09:30.237,BETTER GET ANOTHER DRINK BEFORE THEY CLOSE UP.
00:09:30.320,00:09:31.530,YOU'RE COMING WITH ME TO HELP CARRY THEM.
00:09:31.612,00:09:32.947,YOU'RE GONNA BE A WAITER TONIGHT.
00:09:33.031,00:09:35.700,LAZY-ASS CADET. LAZY-ASS CADET.

00:09:46.503,00:09:48.963,"I THOUGHT HIGGINS MIGHT HAVE-- NO, HE PLAYED IT PERFECTLY."
00:09:49.047,00:09:50.882,MADE ME THINK YOU WEREN'T COMING AT ALL.
00:09:50.965,00:09:52.967,ARE YOU KIDDING? WE WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT FOR THE WORLD.
00:09:53.051,00:09:55.970,"ON THE LIBRARY, ARE THEY GOING TO PUT FRANK OR FRANCIS?"
00:09:56.054,00:10:00.308,FRANCIS. IT'S THE SAME AS THE NAME ABOVE THE DOOR IN MY OFFICE IN THE CAPITOL.
00:10:00.392,00:10:02.227,FRANCIS IS BETTER FOR LIBRARIES.
00:10:02.310,00:10:03.770,FRANK IS BETTER FOR BUMPER STICKERS.
00:10:03.853,00:10:05.646,I GOT A FEW OF THOSE.
00:10:05.730,00:10:07.690,DOES ANYBODY EVER ACTUALLY CALL YOU FRANCIS?
00:10:07.774,00:10:09.025,CLAIRE DOES. SHE'S THE ONLY ONE.
00:10:09.109,00:10:11.194,SHE SEEMS LIKE A REAL PRIZE.
00:10:11.278,00:10:13.280,SHE IS.
00:10:13.363,00:10:16.991,"BAR WAS ALREADY SHUT DOWN, BUT LOOK WHAT I SCORED."

00:10:55.738,00:10:57.198,ANSWER ME. DID YOU INVITE HIM?
00:11:07.167,00:11:08.460,"CAROLINE, STOP!"
00:11:18.677,00:11:20.597,PAUL? YOU GOT A MINUTE TO TALK?
00:11:20.679,00:11:21.722,THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.
00:11:23.600,00:11:27.686,"I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR WHEN I SAW YOU LAST TIME IN WASHINGTON, HOW I TREATED YOU."
00:11:31.816,00:11:34.861,AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SHIPYARD.
00:11:34.944,00:11:36.530,I GOT A PLAN TO FIX IT.
00:11:38.948,00:11:41.368,YOU DON'T WANT EVERYTHING GOING INTO THE ROTH IRA.
00:11:41.451,00:11:43.036,"5, 10 GRAND A YEAR."
00:11:45.704,00:11:47.748,"LOW-RISK, HIGH-YIELD."
00:11:47.832,00:11:51.461,I THINK CLAIRE AND I HAVE THINGS PRETTY WELL UNDER CONTROL.
00:11:51.545,00:11:57.384,"IF I BROUGHT A SENIOR U.S. CONGRESSMAN INTO THE FUND, HOO-HOO-HOO, THAT WOULD REALLY UP MY STOCK IN THE COMPANY."
00:11:57.467,00:11:59.052,WHAT ARE YOU ALL GABBING ABOUT BACK THERE?
00:11:59.135,00:12:00.928,WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OLD LIBRARY.
00:12:01.012,00:12:02.138,"YEAH, WHAT'S HAPPENING TO IT?"
00:12:02.222,00:12:03.473,THEY GONNA TEAR IT DOWN?
00:12:03.557,00:12:04.891,I DON'T KNOW. THEY COULD GUT IT.
00:12:04.974,00:12:07.185,THEY COULD TURN IT INTO A STUDENT CENTER.
00:12:09.979,00:12:11.398,LIKE WE USED TO.
00:12:11.481,00:12:13.358,- I'M GAME. - DO IT.
00:12:20.823,00:12:22.534,THAT'S IT. THERE YOU GO. THAT'S IT.
00:12:31.376,00:12:33.002,SHH. IT'S A LIBRARY.
00:12:33.086,00:12:54.733,THIS-- THIS-- THE-- THE SENTINEL-- THE ASSOCIATION HAD ABOUT 3 MILLION SAVED UP IN RESERVE FOR EMERGENCIES.
00:12:54.815,00:12:59.028,"SPLIT THAT UP BETWEEN 12,000 MEMBERS, IT'S NOTHING."
00:12:59.112,00:13:01.531,A COUPLE OF WEEKS' GROCERIES.
00:13:01.615,00:13:02.699,THERE'S A BILL I'M WORKING ON.
00:13:02.781,00:13:09.289,"MAJOR FEDERAL FUNDS GOING TOWARDS PUBLIC PARKS, GREEN COMMERCIAL SPACES, CLEANING UP WASTE SITES."
00:13:13.918,00:13:14.919,THAT'S NOT EVEN HALF.
00:13:15.002,00:13:16.087,IT'S A START.
00:13:16.170,00:13:17.672,"- HOW SOON? - A YEAR, MAYBE TWO."
00:13:17.756,00:13:19.048,TWO FUCKING YEARS?
00:13:19.132,00:13:21.134,WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO UNTIL THEN?
00:13:21.217,00:13:23.136,"- LISTEN, THERE'S A COMMUNITY MEETING TOMORROW. - I HEARD."
00:13:23.219,00:13:24.845,I'M GONNA GO OVER EVERYTHING IN DETAIL.
00:13:24.929,00:13:26.556,- YOU GONNA BE THERE? - WASN'T PLANNING ON IT.
00:13:26.640,00:13:28.891,I'D LIKE YOU TO BE THERE. EVERYBODY RESPECTS YOU.
00:13:28.975,00:13:30.268,WANT ME TO VOUCH FOR YOU?
00:13:32.019,00:13:35.064,"LISTEN, I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE KNOW."
00:13:36.983,00:13:37.984,I'M RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR.
00:13:39.110,00:13:40.361,I ANNOUNCE SOON.
00:13:40.445,00:13:43.114,BUT I NEED THE ASSOCIATION BEHIND ME BEFORE I DO THAT.
00:13:43.197,00:13:44.574,"NOW, I KNOW I LET YOU DOWN WITH THE SHIPYARD."
00:13:44.658,00:13:47.744,"BUT IF I WIN A GOVERNOR'S RACE, I CAN GET EVERYTHING BACK ON TRACK."
00:13:47.826,00:13:49.579,YOU SHOW UP ON MY DOORSTEP ASKING FOR MY FORGIVENESS.
00:13:49.663,00:13:53.249,NOW YOU WANT ME TO BE YOUR LAPDOG AFTER I LOST MY FUCKING JOB?
00:13:53.333,00:13:54.959,THIS WATERSHED BILL IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
00:13:55.042,00:13:56.586,"IF I'M GOVERNOR, THERE'S SO MUCH I CAN DO."
00:13:56.670,00:13:59.547,IT'S BULLSHIT. YOU JUST WANT TO USE ME.
00:13:59.631,00:14:00.757,IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
00:14:00.839,00:14:02.342,YEAH. IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THAT.
00:14:02.425,00:14:04.010,"JESUS CHRIST, PETE."
00:14:04.093,00:14:06.680,YOU FUCKING POLITICIANS.
00:14:06.763,00:14:07.764,PAUL.
00:14:24.197,00:14:27.492,I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU AND FRANK WERE STAYING HERE.
00:14:27.575,00:14:30.411,WE ALWAYS STAY HERE WHEN WE'RE IN CHARLESTON.
00:14:30.495,00:14:31.871,"YOU KNOW THAT, REMY."
00:14:31.954,00:14:34.123,THE '08 CAMPAIGN.
00:14:38.712,00:14:40.421,"IS, UH, FRANK AROUND?"
00:14:40.505,00:14:43.090,HE'S NOT. HE'S OFF CAVORTING WITH OLD CLASSMATES.
00:14:43.174,00:14:44.467,HMM.
00:14:44.551,00:14:46.553,YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A DRINK?
00:14:48.179,00:14:50.390,THEY BOOKED ME THE BRIDAL SUITE.
00:14:50.473,00:14:52.475,THERE'S CHAMPAGNE ON ICE.
00:14:52.559,00:14:55.645,"MY, MY, YOU'VE GROWN VERY CONFIDENT SINCE YOU WORKED FOR FRANCIS."
00:14:55.729,00:14:57.313,"I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONFIDENT, CLAIRE."
00:14:59.733,00:15:00.734,NEVER HAD THE BRIDAL SUITE.
00:15:00.817,00:15:03.695,THE STAFF ALWAYS STAYED IN THE BEST WESTERN FOUR BLOCKS AWAY.
00:15:03.778,00:15:05.572,ENJOY YOUR CHAMPAGNE.
00:15:05.655,00:15:07.990,I WASN'T SUGGESTING ANYTHING MORE THAN A DRINK.
00:15:08.074,00:15:09.325,WEREN'T YOU?
00:15:09.409,00:15:10.702,PURELY BEING POLITE.

00:15:55.747,00:15:57.957,"HEY, KENNY, I THINK YOU GOT A LITTLE TOO BIG FOR THIS."
00:15:58.040,00:16:00.084,I THINK THE HOLE GOT A LOT SMALLER.
00:16:03.671,00:16:05.757,DON'T LET A LITTLE GIRTH STOP YOU.
00:16:05.840,00:16:06.966,YEAH.
00:16:07.049,00:16:08.885,"HERE IT IS. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK."

00:19:02.391,00:19:05.645,I CAN TOTALLY SEE YOU HERE AT 16.

00:19:11.275,00:19:13.611,"HEY, HOW'D IT GO WITH PAUL?"
00:19:13.694,00:19:15.321,HE TOLD ME TO FUCK OFF.
00:19:15.404,00:19:19.575,"WHICH IS WHAT MY MOTHER TOLD ME, IN HER OWN SPECIAL WAY."
00:19:19.659,00:19:20.701,AM I GOING TO MEET HER?
00:19:20.785,00:19:21.786,YOU DON'T WANT TO MEET HER.
00:19:21.869,00:19:25.331,"I JUST WANTED TO STOP BY, SAY HEY, SEE HER FACE."
00:19:25.414,00:19:28.835,"CHRISTINA, IT WAS REALLY SWEET OF YOU TO COME UP HERE."
00:19:28.918,00:19:35.842,"SERIOUSLY, I'M OFFICIALLY CONVINCED YOU'RE THE MOST AMAZING WOMAN I'VE EVER BEEN WITH, BUT I MEANT IT WHEN I SAID I WANTED TO TAKE THIS TRIP ALONE."
00:19:35.925,00:19:38.469,THIS THING TOMORROW ISN'T GOING TO BE PLEASANT.
00:19:38.552,00:19:41.472,WHICH IS WHY I CAME-- TO BE HERE FOR YOU.
00:19:41.555,00:19:42.556,MORAL SUPPORT.
00:19:42.640,00:19:44.058,I KNOW THESE PEOPLE.
00:19:44.142,00:19:46.686,THEY'RE GOING TO LAY INTO ME BIG TIME.
00:19:46.769,00:19:48.813,TOMORROW'S AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR THE CAMPAIGN.
00:19:48.896,00:19:50.898,DON'T FIGHT ME ON THIS.

00:20:04.162,00:20:06.539,COME ON. DON'T BE LIKE THAT.
00:20:06.622,00:20:08.332,A HOTEL WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE.
00:20:13.921,00:20:16.716,"OH, CAMPAIGN FUNDS."
00:20:16.799,00:20:18.926,YOU SEE THAT CRACK UP IN THE CEILING?
00:20:19.010,00:20:20.511,MM-HMM.
00:20:20.594,00:20:25.349,I USED TO FALL ASLEEP STARING AT IT EVERY NIGHT.
00:20:27.434,00:20:29.770,I KNOW EVERY INCH AND CURVE.
00:20:41.240,00:20:45.578,IT'S DARK IN HERE. I'M SCARED.
00:20:45.661,00:20:47.997,"- WHOA, WHOA. - HEY, HEY, HEY."
00:20:48.081,00:20:50.499,"BE FUCKING CAREFUL, MAN!"

00:21:01.969,00:21:03.846,WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
00:21:06.348,00:21:10.477,HOW COME YOU AND FRANK HAVE NEVER HAD KIDS?
00:21:10.561,00:21:11.771,YOU'VE NEVER HAD KIDS.
00:21:11.854,00:21:12.897,"YEAH, BUT I'M NOT MARRIED."
00:21:12.980,00:21:14.607,ANSWER THE QUESTION.
00:21:16.650,00:21:19.695,WE JUST DECIDED NOT TO.
00:21:19.779,00:21:21.572,THERE WASN'T SOME BIG CONVERSATION.
00:21:21.655,00:21:23.908,I THINK YOU'RE LYING.
00:21:27.494,00:21:29.329,YOU HONESTLY NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT?
00:21:29.413,00:21:33.542,"I MEAN, YEAH, MAYBE, ONCE OR TWICE."
00:21:35.461,00:21:37.880,"I MEAN, I DON'T FEEL THERE'S SOME VOID."
00:21:38.881,00:21:41.050,I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY WITHOUT.
00:21:41.968,00:21:43.469,WHAT ABOUT YOU?
00:21:43.552,00:21:48.849,CAN YOU IMAGINE ME WIPING A BABY'S ASS AND CHANGING NAPPIES?
00:21:48.933,00:21:50.143,"NO, I CAN'T."
00:21:50.226,00:21:51.644,"ACTUALLY, YES, I JUST DID."
00:21:51.727,00:21:53.187,I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET OFF THE PHONE.
00:21:53.271,00:21:54.688,YOU'VE RUINED EVERYTHING.
00:21:58.609,00:22:00.153,"WELL, WE REALLY SHOULD GET OFF."
00:22:00.236,00:22:02.738,"IT'S BEEN... OVER AN HOUR, I THINK."
00:22:02.822,00:22:04.615,OKAY.
00:22:06.117,00:22:08.452,- GO ON THEN. - I'M HANGING UP RIGHT NOW.

00:23:04.091,00:23:07.970,"OH, I'D LOVE TO SEE YOUR ASS WITH A PADDLE, BOUNCING THROUGH A CLASS-FOUR RAPID."
00:23:08.054,00:23:12.308,"IF I CAN WHIP CONGRESS INTO SUBMISSION, I'M NOT AFRAID OF A LITTLE WHITE WATER."
00:23:12.390,00:23:15.269,"YOU CAN'T TAME A RAPID, FRANK."

00:24:07.529,00:24:09.615,HOW DO YOU MEAN?
00:24:09.698,00:24:14.203,"WHEN I WALKED ON CAMPUS TODAY, I WONDERED, DID IT MEAN ANYTHING?"
00:24:14.287,00:24:18.456,IF IT'S JUST A PLACE WE SPENT FOUR YEARS OF OUR LIVES-- OR WAS THERE MORE?
00:24:18.540,00:24:19.959,I DON'T KNOW.
00:24:20.042,00:24:23.045,I DO KNOW YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GUY THAT WAS GONNA GET A BUILDING NAMED AFTER HIM.
00:24:23.129,00:24:27.883,I KNEW THAT THE MOMENT I SAW YOU CUSS OUT THE DRILL SERGEANT WHEN WE WERE KNOBS.
00:24:29.802,00:24:33.680,THE LIBRARY IS A SHAM.
00:24:33.764,00:24:35.433,HIGGINS ASKED ME A FAVOR.
00:24:35.515,00:24:37.393,I ASKED SOMEONE ELSE A FAVOR.
00:24:37.475,00:24:39.353,THEY SLAPPED MY NAME ON IT.
00:24:39.437,00:24:41.147,POLITICS. LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE.
00:24:41.230,00:24:43.190,NOT EVERYBODY GETS ASKED THOSE FAVORS.
00:24:43.274,00:24:45.318,OR KNOWS HOW TO DELIVER ON 'EM.
00:24:45.401,00:24:47.653,"OH, IN 50 YEARS THEY'LL JUST REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING ELSE."

00:25:13.553,00:25:15.055,IT'S A LONG TIME AGO.
00:25:15.139,00:25:18.309,WE WERE SO CLOSE.
00:25:18.392,00:25:19.643,LIKE BROTHERS.
00:25:19.726,00:25:20.936,MORE THAN BROTHERS.
00:25:21.020,00:25:23.356,"WE WERE KIDS, FRANK."
00:25:23.439,00:25:25.107,WE MESSED AROUND A COUPLE OF TIMES.

00:26:04.063,00:26:06.232,IT'S ATTRACTION.
00:26:10.568,00:26:12.779,DIDN'T SEE ANY HARM IN IT.
00:26:14.781,00:26:16.450,YOU KNOW WHY I LOVE RAFTING?
00:26:16.534,00:26:22.580,"WHEN YOU'RE ON THE WATER, ALL YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IS WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU."
00:26:22.664,00:26:24.250,EVERYTHING IS IN THE MOMENT.
00:26:24.333,00:26:26.419,I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE PAST.

00:30:41.548,00:30:44.551,"YOU THINK, YOU'RE CONFIDENT, YOU CAN'T PREDICT 100%."
00:30:44.635,00:30:46.011,HOW DOES ANY OF THAT HELP US?
00:30:46.094,00:30:47.513,I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

00:31:00.192,00:31:03.320,"UH, GRANTED, IT'S LESS THAN YOU MADE AT THE SHIPYARD."
00:31:03.403,00:31:05.197,- SO HOW MUCH? - IT'S ABOUT $6 AN HOUR.
00:31:06.532,00:31:07.866,THAT'S NOT EVEN MINIMUM WAGE.
00:31:10.994,00:31:13.038,THE TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE A VALUABLE RESOURCE.
00:31:13.121,00:31:14.414,YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT.
00:31:14.498,00:31:16.750,I CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE INVESTMENTS.
00:31:16.834,00:31:19.712,SIX DOLLARS AN HOUR PUTS MY FAMILY ON THE STREET.

00:31:33.058,00:31:35.018,BUT THAT DOESN'T CUT IT FOR THE REST OF US.
00:31:35.101,00:31:37.270,"YOU SAID YOU HAD OUR BACKS, YOU LYING PIECE OF SHIT!"
00:31:37.354,00:31:39.648,WE DON'T EAT PAPER FOR DINNER.

00:31:42.442,00:31:48.365,"WHEN WE ALL VOTED FOR YOU, I DIDN'T THINK THAT EVERY ONE OF THOSE VOTES WAS ANOTHER NAIL IN OUR OWN COFFINS."
00:31:50.576,00:31:52.327,EVERYBODY JUST SIT DOWN FOR TEN MINUTES.
00:31:52.411,00:31:59.459,WE CAN GO OVER THIS PROPOSAL POINT BY POINT AND YOU CAN GET THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED TO GET THE RESOURCES THAT YOU WANT.
00:32:01.670,00:32:03.714,IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T WANT TO FIND A SOLUTION.
00:32:03.797,00:32:05.048,THEY'RE SCARED.
00:32:05.131,00:32:08.134,"I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE SCARED, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T LISTEN."
00:32:08.218,00:32:09.720,"YOU DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE, CHRISTINA."

00:32:12.222,00:32:14.182,I SPOKE TO THEM. I TOOK THEIR CALLS.
00:32:14.266,00:32:15.434,I REPLIED TO THEIR E-MAILS.
00:32:15.517,00:32:16.810,YOU DIDN'T GROW UP WITH THEM.
00:32:16.894,00:32:21.565,I DON'T NEED TO GROW UP HAND TO MOUTH TO EMPATHIZE WITH THE FACT THAT-- THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN EMPATHY.
00:32:26.737,00:32:28.822,THE HOUSE KEYS ARE IN MY JACKET.
00:32:28.906,00:32:30.574,I'LL CALL YOU.

00:33:14.033,00:33:17.162,YOU STILL KEEP THE SPARE KEY BEHIND THE LOOSE BRICK ON THE PORCH.
00:33:17.245,00:33:20.707,YOU BREAK INTO MY HOUSE? YOU SCARE MY KIDS LIKE THAT?
00:33:20.791,00:33:22.000,"WE GOTTA TALK, PAUL."
00:33:22.083,00:33:23.627,WE TALKED LAST NIGHT. NOW GET OUT.
00:33:23.710,00:33:25.420,"I CAN CONVINCE THESE PEOPLE, BUT I NEED YOUR HELP."
00:33:25.504,00:33:29.007,- LEAVE MY HOUSE. - SIT DOWN.
00:33:29.090,00:33:31.760,"I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO HURT YOU WITH MY CHILDREN UPSTAIRS, PETEY."

00:33:33.971,00:33:35.221,THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.
00:33:35.305,00:33:37.265,I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
00:33:47.442,00:33:49.486,UGH! GET BACK UPSTAIRS!
00:34:18.640,00:34:21.393,WHAT ARE WE DOING?
00:34:21.476,00:34:24.062,"I DON'T WANNA FIGHT YOU, PETEY."
00:34:25.605,00:34:29.985,I DON'T WANNA FIGHT YOU EITHER. I WILL.
00:34:30.068,00:34:32.445,BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO.
00:34:37.367,00:34:39.244,WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
00:34:41.287,00:34:42.998,BUT I COULDN'T FORESTALL THE INEVITABLE.
00:34:43.081,00:34:47.419,THE SHIPYARD WAS CLOSING.
00:34:47.502,00:34:49.046,"IF NOT THIS YEAR, THEN NEXT."
00:34:49.128,00:34:50.338,OR THE YEAR AFTER.
00:34:50.422,00:34:52.507,WE ALL KNOW THAT.
00:34:52.591,00:34:54.300,I COULD HAVE LIED TO YOU.
00:34:54.384,00:34:55.928,I COULD HAVE PRETENDED TO DO MORE.
00:34:56.011,00:34:57.596,BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN LIVING IN THE PAST.
00:35:00.223,00:35:03.518,HERE'S ANOTHER TRUTH THAT'S GONNA BE HARD TO SWALLOW.
00:35:03.602,00:35:06.354,I'M ALL YOU'VE GOT.

00:37:52.979,00:37:57.025,NOTHING IS PERMANENT. NOT EVEN THIS BUILDING.
00:37:57.109,00:37:59.277,I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND UNGRATEFUL.

00:38:36.314,00:38:39.985,"A POLITICIAN, A NAME, A FEW ACCOMPLISHMENTS."
00:38:40.068,00:38:41.069,BUT I DON'T BLAME YOU.
00:38:53.999,00:38:55.917,I...
00:38:57.502,00:39:00.297,I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE...
00:39:09.347,00:39:13.226,HARMONY. THAT'S THE WORD THAT STUCK IN MY MIND.
00:39:13.310,00:39:15.603,HARMONY.
00:39:15.687,00:39:20.150,IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT'S LASTING OR PERMANENT.
00:39:26.865,00:39:29.326,FOR A MOMENT.
00:39:29.408,00:39:34.247,AND THAT MOMENT LASTS...
00:39:34.331,00:39:36.291,THE LENGTH OF A BREATH.
00:39:40.628,00:39:43.048,THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT MY TIME HERE.
00:39:48.178,00:39:49.512,YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.
00:39:49.595,00:39:52.349,I HAD MORE THAN A FEW WHISKEYS LAST NIGHT.
00:39:52.431,00:39:59.480,"YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A CADET, WE COULD DRINK ALL NIGHT AND THEN GET UP IN THE MORNING AND MARCH 20 MILES, BUT THESE DAYS I'M LUCKY I GOT UP THESE THREE STEPS."
00:40:03.401,00:40:05.987,I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:40:06.071,00:40:07.572,THIS IS A GREAT HONOR.
00:40:07.655,00:40:10.033,I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT HIGGINS.
00:40:10.116,00:40:13.578,"AND OF COURSE, THE LOVE OF MY LIFE, CLAIRE."
00:40:15.955,00:40:17.374,THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
00:40:24.881,00:40:27.842,- YOU OKAY? - YES.
00:40:38.103,00:40:39.896,"HI, MA."
00:40:43.066,00:40:44.817,THIS IS CHRISTINA. I TOLD YOU ABOUT HER YESTERDAY.
00:40:44.901,00:40:46.736,"- HI, MRS. RUSSO. - HEY."
00:40:46.819,00:40:48.905,WE JUST CAME BY TO SAY GOODBYE.
00:40:48.988,00:40:50.489,WE HAVE TO CATCH A TRAIN IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
00:40:50.573,00:40:52.409,OKAY.
00:40:56.788,00:40:57.997,THEY STILL HAVEN'T FIXED THAT LIGHT?
00:40:58.081,00:40:59.916,UH-UH.
00:40:59.999,00:41:01.542,THINGS WENT WELL TODAY.
00:41:01.626,00:41:03.878,I THINK THE FOLKS IN THE YARD ARE GONNA GET BEHIND ME.
00:41:03.962,00:41:05.171,PETER DID A GREAT JOB.
00:41:05.255,00:41:06.464,HAND ME THAT BLANKET.
00:41:06.547,00:41:09.926,THE A.C. IN HERE IS NUTS.
00:41:14.180,00:41:16.849,WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAND?
00:41:16.933,00:41:18.143,I GOT IN A FIGHT.
00:41:18.226,00:41:20.186,DID YOU WIN?
00:41:20.270,00:41:22.772,"YEAH, I GUESS I DID."
00:41:22.855,00:41:25.400,THAT'S MY PETER.
00:41:26.776,00:41:29.862,SO YOU'RE FUCKING MY SON.
00:41:29.946,00:41:31.697,LIGHTEN UP. I'M JUST MESSING WITH YOU.
00:41:35.452,00:41:36.661,EXCUSE ME.
00:41:38.704,00:41:40.290,"YEAH, MY MOTHER'S IN ROOM 409."
00:41:40.373,00:41:41.624,SHE HAS A LIGHT OUT THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.
00:41:41.707,00:41:42.708,ALL RIGHT. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
00:41:42.792,00:41:44.127,"OKAY, THANKS."
00:41:44.210,00:41:47.546,"LOOK, BABE, IF YOU PUT THAT PINK THING ON, I'M TELLING YOU..."
00:41:51.426,00:41:53.428,HOLD ON. WHAT IS IT?
00:41:53.511,00:41:54.887,THE LIGHT IN MY MOTHER'S ROOM.
00:41:54.971,00:41:56.722,I TOLD YOU I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT LATER.
00:41:56.806,00:41:59.351,"NO, YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF IT NOW."
00:42:01.560,00:42:05.023,"AND TURN THE A.C. DOWN WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE, TOO."
00:42:20.663,00:42:23.958,"HEY, I'M REAL PROUD OF YOU, FRANK."
00:42:24.042,00:42:26.002,"I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT I FEEL THE SAME."
00:42:27.753,00:42:30.131,"WELL, HAVING ALL YOU HERE WAS WHAT MADE IT SPECIAL."
00:42:30.215,00:42:31.424,NOW YOU STAY IN TOUCH.
00:42:31.508,00:42:33.510,"- WILL DO. - SEE YA, BUDDY."
00:42:37.847,00:42:39.932,"BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY, FRANK."
00:42:40.016,00:42:41.976,"YEAH, THEY DID A GOOD JOB."
00:42:42.060,00:42:45.271,YOUR SPEECH. I'M GLAD I WAS HERE FOR THAT.
00:42:45.355,00:42:46.523,ME TOO.
00:42:46.605,00:42:48.149,YOU SHOULD COME OUT TO SALIDA SOMETIME.
00:42:48.233,00:42:49.775,I'LL TAKE YOU OUT ON THE ARKANSAS RIVER.
00:42:49.859,00:42:51.944,- I SHOULD DO THAT. - ANY TIME YOU WANT.
00:42:56.282,00:42:57.992,YEP.
00:43:24.269,00:43:25.770,EDWARD HAS THE CAR READY.
00:43:25.853,00:43:28.523,I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
00:43:28.606,00:43:30.066,TAKE YOUR TIME.
00:43:58.886,00:44:00.263,YOU HEAR FROM PETER?
00:44:00.346,00:44:02.348,LOOKS LIKE THE SHIPBUILDERS ARE ON BOARD.
00:44:02.432,00:44:06.685,TOMORROW MORNING WE START WORKING ON HIS DRAFT - FOR HIS ANNOUNCEMENT SPEECH. - GOT IT.
00:44:06.769,00:44:09.564,AND I WANT THE BRIEF ON THE MOCK-UP FOR THE WATERSHED BILL.
00:44:09.647,00:44:10.856,I GOT THAT WITH ME.
00:44:10.940,00:44:12.358,RIDE WITH ME TO THE AIRPORT.
00:44:12.442,00:44:14.735,WE'LL GO THROUGH IT IN THE CAR.
00:00:08.717,00:00:10.469,"WHEN THE ENEMY ATTACKED, YOU RAN AWAY."
00:00:10.552,00:00:11.762,THAT'S TREASON.
00:00:11.846,00:00:14.515,NOW IT'S TIME TO SPLATTER YOUR BRAINS EVERYWHERE.
00:00:17.100,00:00:19.019,SHUT UP! DIE LIKE A MAN!
00:00:19.102,00:00:20.729,BUT I HAVE A WIFE AND FAMILY.
00:00:22.815,00:00:24.316,THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO COWARDS.
00:00:24.399,00:00:26.527,"HEY, SHH, SHH, SHH! YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT DOWN."
00:00:26.610,00:00:29.404,- THERE'S AN IMPORTANT MEETING GOING ON. - SORRY.
00:00:29.488,00:00:31.031,I'LL SET YOU UP IN THE COPY ROOM.
00:00:31.114,00:00:32.908,YOU WON'T BE IN THE WAY THERE.
00:00:34.618,00:00:38.539,MOST OF YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE NOT GONNA WANNA SPEND THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN JUST 25 DISTRICTS.
00:00:38.622,00:00:40.457,TRY PERSUASION FIRST.
00:00:40.541,00:00:42.083,TALKING POINTS ARE IN YOUR PACKETS.
00:00:42.167,00:00:47.214,"AND IF YOU WANT MORE DETAILED INFORMATION-- RESEARCH, STATISTICS-- YOU CAN CONTACT GILLIAN OR MYSELF."
00:00:47.297,00:00:49.216,"AND WHEN IT COMES TO DOLING OUT FAVORS, TALK TO DOUG."
00:00:52.093,00:00:53.595,I'LL BE CAMPAIGNING IN PENNSYLVANIA.
00:00:53.679,00:00:58.600,"ALL MY EVENTS THIS WEEK WILL BE IN COUNTIES WITHIN THE WATERSHED, SO I'LL BE WORKING THE MEDIA ANGLE."
00:00:58.684,00:01:01.436,"BUT IF YOU NEED ME TO GET ON THE PHONE WITH ANYBODY, REACH OUT TO CHRISTINA."
00:01:01.520,00:01:02.521,SHE'LL WORK IT INTO MY SCHEDULE.
00:01:02.604,00:01:05.900,"I HAVE TO SAY, FRANK, $200 MILLION IS GOING TO BE A HARD SELL."
00:01:05.983,00:01:07.693,THE NATURAL GAS LOBBY'S ALREADY PUTTING UP A BIG FIGHT.
00:01:07.776,00:01:09.820,WE NEED TO MAKE THIS ABOUT JOBS.
00:01:09.904,00:01:12.447,BUT THE DRILLING INDUSTRY CAN OFFER FAR MORE JOBS THAN THIS BILL CAN.
00:01:14.199,00:01:15.534,IT JUST MAKES SURE THE DRILLING IS DONE RESPONSIBLY.
00:01:15.617,00:01:17.411,IT ADDS MORE JOBS ON TOP OF THAT.
00:01:17.494,00:01:19.830,I'VE ALREADY BEEN APPROACHED BY SANCORP WITH REELECTION FUNDS.
00:01:19.914,00:01:24.001,I HAVE TOO. THEY OFFERED ME A DONATION PACKAGE FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT DRILLING COMPANIES.
00:01:24.083,00:01:26.127,- REMY DANTON? - YEP.
00:01:29.840,00:01:32.384,"LOOK, I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY TO TURN DOWN MONEY."
00:01:32.467,00:01:40.308,"BUT IF THE REPUBLICANS CONTROL REDISTRICTING IN PENNSYLVANIA, WE LOSE THE HOUSE NEXT ELECTION, AND ALL OF YOU LOSE YOUR COMMITTEE CHAIRMANSHIPS."
00:01:40.392,00:01:42.394,THIS IS A FEATHER THAT WE NEED IN PETER'S HAT.
00:01:42.477,00:01:48.275,"A LOSS ON THIS BILL ENDANGERS HIS CHANCE OF WINNING, AND WE ARE FIGHTING TO KEEP OUR MAJORITY HERE."
00:01:48.358,00:01:50.569,ANY OTHER CONCERNS?
00:01:50.652,00:01:52.988,I WANT A FIRST VOTE COUNT BY 4:00 TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
00:01:53.072,00:01:55.699,THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
00:03:30.669,00:03:33.296,IT'S BRUTAL. 22 STOPS IN THREE DAYS.
00:03:33.380,00:03:35.799,- THAT'S A LOT OF SLEEPING ON THE BUS. - NO SLEEPING.
00:03:35.883,00:03:37.801,THAT BUS IS THE ONLY PLACE I CAN GET WORK DONE.
00:03:37.885,00:03:45.726,"YOU KNOW, FRANCIS DID A BIG BUS TOUR IN '98, AND THE BUS LOST ITS BRAKES GOING DOWN A HILL, AND WE LANDED IN A TOBACCO FIELD."
00:03:54.776,00:03:56.111,AND IT WAS ACTUALLY FUN.
00:03:58.113,00:03:59.447,WE HAD THE WHOLE STAFF IN THE FLATBED.
00:03:59.531,00:04:01.992,WE ACTUALLY GOT THERE TEN MINUTES EARLY.
00:04:02.076,00:04:04.870,"- I THINK I SHOULD BE HERE TO HELP DRUM UP VOTES. - CAREFUL, SIR. IT'S VERY HOT."
00:04:07.372,00:04:08.957,THAT'S GONNA HELP US WITH THE COUNT.
00:04:09.041,00:04:11.126,I REACHED OUT TO HIM. HE NEVER GOT BACK TO ME.
00:04:11.210,00:04:13.128,I DON'T KNOW IF HE EVEN KNOWS THE TALKING POINTS ABOUT THE BILL.
00:04:13.212,00:04:14.671,I DON'T THINK JIM WANTS TO GO.
00:04:14.755,00:04:18.842,"HE'S DOING IT AS A FAVOR TO THE PRESIDENT AND I, SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF HE DOESN'T KNOW THE TALKING POINTS."
00:04:18.926,00:04:20.468,"PEOPLE WANNA SEE HIM BE FOLKSY, YOU KNOW?"
00:04:26.183,00:04:28.560,"OKAY, IT'S TIME FOR US TO GO. I'M SO SORRY."
00:04:28.643,00:04:31.063,IT'S ALL RIGHT. I JUST NEED TO RUN IT UNDER SOME COLD WATER.
00:04:33.648,00:04:35.192,I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.
00:04:35.275,00:04:37.694,I DESPISE CHILDREN.
00:04:37.778,00:04:39.696,THERE. I'VE SAID IT.
00:04:39.780,00:04:41.698,YOU CAN'T ACT LIKE THAT IN HERE.
00:04:41.782,00:04:43.408,- YOU HAVE TO BE A BIG BOY. - I KNOW.
00:04:43.491,00:04:45.577,"PETER, WE REALLY NEED TO GET GOING."
00:04:45.660,00:04:48.205,WE'VE ALREADY MISSED ONE FLIGHT BECAUSE THE MEETING WENT OVER.
00:04:48.288,00:04:52.918,"I BOOKED US ANOTHER ONE AT 9:25, BUT-- - WE HAVE TO DROP THE KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL. - IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY TIGHT."
00:04:53.001,00:04:55.545,"IF WE MISS THIS PLANE, WE HAVE TO CANCEL OUR FIRST EVENT."
00:04:57.464,00:04:59.925,I'VE GOTTA GET PACKETS READY FOR THE LUNCHTIME SUB-CAUCUSES.
00:05:00.008,00:05:02.886,"PETER, I'D DO IT, BUT WE HAVE A MEETING WITH GREENPEACE IN 20 MINUTES."
00:05:02.970,00:05:05.013,- I GOTTA GET THEIR RATING ON THE BILL. - WHERE'S THEIR SCHOOL?
00:05:05.097,00:05:07.099,CONNECTICUT AND Q.
00:05:07.182,00:05:09.059,"- OH, I CAN TAKE THEM. - YOU SURE?"
00:05:09.143,00:05:11.061,YES. IT'S ON THE WAY TO MY OFFICE.
00:05:11.145,00:05:18.235,THIS WATERSHED ACT PROVES THAT ONCE AGAIN THE ANTI-CAPITALIST AGENDA IS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
00:05:20.487,00:05:29.246,"HERE ARE THE DEMOCRATS EATING UP ALL OF THEIR SOFT SCIENCE, ORGANICALLY HOMEGROWN PROPAGANDA THAT THE ECO-FANATICS ARE FORCE-FEEDING THEM."
00:05:29.329,00:05:39.840,"AND OVER HERE, AT THE TAIL END OF ALL THOSE JACKASSES, ARE MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS-- PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO WORK HARD AND RELY ON JOBS IN THE DRILLING INDUSTRY."
00:05:41.382,00:05:43.885,"AND WHAT ABOUT THE HYPOCRISY, FOLKS?"
00:05:43.969,00:05:52.351,DOES PETER RUSSO HONESTLY HAVE THE GALL TO LECTURE US ON THE PURITY OF OUR RIVERS WHEN HE HAS BEEN POLLUTING HIMSELF WITH CHEMICALS FOR YEARS?
00:05:52.435,00:05:55.939,"HE'S NOT JUST BEEN EATING GRASS, HE'S BEEN SMOKING IT."
00:05:56.023,00:05:58.441,IT'S THE ONLY MAJOR BILL HE'S SPONSORED IN SIX YEARS.
00:05:58.525,00:06:01.111,"I KNOW, BUT THEY ALREADY HAVE NATIONAL COVERAGE. WHAT'S THE ANGLE?"
00:06:01.195,00:06:04.739,"IF IT DOESN'T PASS, I THINK HE'LL LOSE SUPPORT FROM THE SHIPBUILDERS' ASSOCIATION."
00:06:04.823,00:06:06.825,SO THEY LOSE SUPPORT. IT'S NOT THAT JUICY.
00:06:06.908,00:06:09.410,THEY'RE A HUGE PART OF HIS GET-OUT-THE-VOTE EFFORT IN PHILLY.
00:06:09.494,00:06:11.205,IT SOUNDS LIKE INSIDE BASEBALL.
00:06:11.288,00:06:13.540,NOT IF I GET THE VOTE COUNT. BLACK AND WHITE NUMBERS.
00:06:13.623,00:06:17.919,"NOBODY HAS THAT. BUT WHEN I CALLED THE CAMPAIGN, THEY STONEWALLED ME."
00:06:18.003,00:06:19.378,SAME THING IN THE WHIP'S OFFICE.
00:06:19.462,00:06:20.797,DO YOU KNOW ANYONE OVER THERE?
00:06:20.881,00:06:22.257,IN UNDERWOOD'S OFFICE?
00:06:22.341,00:06:23.717,"NO, I DON'T."
00:06:23.800,00:06:25.219,NOBODY ON STAFF?
00:06:25.302,00:06:26.887,- HMM-MM. - OH.
00:06:26.970,00:06:29.472,I JUST FIGURED BECAUSE YOU GAVE ME THE RUSSO PROFILE.
00:06:29.556,00:06:30.891,"NO, THAT DIDN'T COME FROM THEM."
00:06:30.974,00:06:32.893,BUT UNDERWOOD ORGANIZED THE CAMPAIGN.
00:06:32.976,00:06:36.021,I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THERE.
00:06:37.189,00:06:38.648,OKAY.
00:06:45.864,00:06:48.825,I SHOULD BE BACK HOME AT 10:00. MEET ME THERE.
00:06:54.248,00:06:56.166,AND I MADE THIS ONE. CAN YOU GUESS WHAT IT IS?
00:06:56.250,00:06:58.752,- A LOBSTER? - NO. IT'S A SCORPION.
00:06:58.835,00:07:02.047,THEY'RE FOR YOU. FOR THE ONES YOU GAVE US.
00:07:10.555,00:07:13.141,NO. THE OTHER KIDS WILL JUST MAKE FUN OF US.
00:07:13.225,00:07:14.976,WHY?
00:07:15.060,00:07:17.645,EVERYBODY HATES US AT SCHOOL.
00:07:17.729,00:07:20.648,THEY SAY DAD'S A CRACKHEAD AND THAT WE'RE CRACK BABIES.
00:07:20.732,00:07:22.483,I LOOKED UP CRACK BABY ON THE COMPUTER.
00:07:22.567,00:07:24.152,I DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT.
00:07:24.236,00:07:27.114,"YEAH, THEY SAY DAD'S GONNA O.D. LIKE AMY WINEHOUSE."
00:07:29.283,00:07:33.494,"WELL, YOU TELL THEM THAT YOUR DAD DOESN'T DO THAT KIND OF THING ANYMORE, RIGHT?"
00:07:38.333,00:07:40.668,DID YOU TRY GOING TO THE TEACHERS?
00:07:40.752,00:07:43.588,WE CAN'T DO THAT. EVERYONE WILL JUST HATE US EVEN MORE.
00:07:48.260,00:07:51.846,"WELL, YOU CAN'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK, RIGHT?"
00:07:51.930,00:07:56.143,I WISH DAD WASN'T RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR.
00:07:56.226,00:07:58.603,- YOU EVER BEEN TO ALLENTOWN BEFORE? - I HAVE NOT.
00:07:58.686,00:08:00.105,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:08:00.188,00:08:02.732,"COMPARED TO NEW YORK, THE PARKING IS EASIER."
00:08:02.816,00:08:04.859,"FINDING A DECENT BAGEL, NOT SO MUCH."
00:08:04.943,00:08:06.569,WE MAKE UP FOR IT WITH THE CREAM CHEESE.
00:08:06.653,00:08:08.196,- SHALL WE? - READY WHEN YOU ARE.
00:08:08.280,00:08:09.990,YOUR WATERSHED BILL.
00:08:10.073,00:08:14.202,"YOU'VE TICKED OFF THE REPUBLICANS, OIL, GAS-- SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA UPSET A FEW PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING."
00:08:14.286,00:08:20.500,"NOT JUST A FEW. THERE'S A SIZABLE COALITION THAT WANTS TO SEE YOUR BILL FAIL, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTALISTS FROM YOUR OWN PARTY."
00:08:20.583,00:08:22.627,- DON'T THINK THE BILL DOES ENOUGH. - WE WANTED A PASSABLE BILL.
00:08:22.710,00:08:27.466,THAT'S WHY WE AIMED FOR MIDDLE GROUND-- DO YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE DELAWARE RIVER?
00:08:27.548,00:08:29.468,I DON'T SPONSOR LEGISLATION I DON'T CARE ABOUT.
00:08:29.550,00:08:31.719,"UNTIL RECENTLY, YOU HADN'T SPONSORED ANY LEGISLATION AT ALL."
00:08:31.803,00:08:35.640,I SPENT MY TIME IN CONGRESS FOCUSING ON THINGS THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO MY CONSTITUENTS.
00:08:35.723,00:08:39.269,- THE SHIPYARD. - KEPT IT OPEN AS LONG AS I COULD.
00:08:39.353,00:08:41.438,OKAY. THAT'S ONE THING. WHAT ARE THE OTHERS?
00:08:41.521,00:08:52.324,"I'D LOVE TO PROVIDE YOU A LIST OF ALL THE THINGS I'VE DONE IN CONGRESS, BUT WE'VE GOT 15 MINUTES-- YOUR OPPONENT HAS LINKED YOUR INACTIVITY TO YOUR FONDNESS FOR SINGLE-MALTS."
00:08:52.407,00:08:59.831,"I'VE BEEN VERY OPEN ABOUT MY PAST, AND I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I CAN TO OVERCOME IT IN A RESPONSIBLE, PERMANENT WAY."
00:08:59.914,00:09:02.125,AND I PREFERRED VODKA TO SCOTCH.
00:09:02.209,00:09:03.543,YOU SHOULD GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT.
00:09:05.837,00:09:13.720,IS YOUR WATERSHED ACT JUST A PLOY TO JUMP INTO THE SPOTLIGHT AND PAD YOUR TRANSCRIPT WHILE YOU APPLY FOR GOVERNOR SCHOOL?
00:09:13.803,00:09:15.722,IT'S REAL MONEY.
00:09:15.805,00:09:18.058,IT'S REAL JOBS.
00:09:18.141,00:09:24.898,AND WHEN THE DELAWARE RIVER IS LESS POLLUTED THAN IT'S BEEN IN 50 YEARS-- IT'S HOLDING UP A REAL GLASS OF ITS WATER AND SEEING HOW CLEAR IT IS.
00:09:24.981,00:09:26.858,THAT'S WHAT MY BUS TOUR IS ABOUT.
00:09:26.941,00:09:29.236,- THE VICE PRESIDENT IS JOINING YOU LATER? - CORRECT.
00:09:29.319,00:09:33.073,WHY HAS IT TAKEN HIM THIS LONG TO ENDORSE YOU?
00:09:33.156,00:09:36.617,HE DIDN'T THINK I WAS WORTH IT.
00:09:36.701,00:09:42.999,"BUT THEN HE HEARD I HAD A ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES, - AND, BOOM, HE WAS ON BOARD. - I MIGHT PRINT THAT."
00:09:43.083,00:09:45.293,"THE MORE OF MY WORDS, THE FEWER OF YOURS, THE BETTER OFF WE'LL BOTH BE."
00:09:45.377,00:09:50.257,"IF I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE SUCH A LIABILITY TO YOURSELF, CONGRESSMAN, I MIGHT EVEN LIKE YOU."
00:09:50.340,00:09:53.968,"IF YOUR CIRCULATION WAS AS HIGH AS THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, I MIGHT LIKE YOU BACK."
00:09:57.805,00:09:59.182,TELL THEM THEY'RE WASTING THEIR MONEY.
00:09:59.266,00:10:01.101,- IT'S GONNA PASS. - ARE YOU SURE?
00:10:01.184,00:10:03.562,WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I GOT A COUNT WRONG?
00:10:03.644,00:10:05.939,"IF YOU WERE CERTAIN, YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO NEUTRALIZE US."
00:10:06.022,00:10:07.566,"WELL, SANCORP HAS BEEN GOOD TO ME."
00:10:07.648,00:10:09.568,"I'M JUST TRYING TO DO YOU AND THEM A FAVOR, REMY."
00:10:09.650,00:10:11.236,THEN WHY PROPOSE THE LEGISLATION IN THE FIRST PLACE?
00:10:11.319,00:10:12.653,YOU MUST'VE KNOWN THEY WOULD OPPOSE IT.
00:10:12.737,00:10:14.531,THE REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ARE MINIMAL.
00:10:14.614,00:10:16.074,"THERE'S A BIGGER BATTLE HERE, FRANK."
00:10:16.157,00:10:19.578,"SANCORP IS AGAINST ANY STEP TOWARD REGULATION, NO MATTER HOW SMALL."
00:10:19.660,00:10:22.622,RUSSO'S PLANTED HIS FEET ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE FENCE.
00:10:22.705,00:10:24.624,HOW MUCH ARE YOU GIVING HIS OPPONENT?
00:10:24.707,00:10:26.667,CHECK THE F.E.C. FILINGS.
00:10:28.628,00:10:30.380,"THIS IS A TEN-BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY, FRANK."
00:10:30.464,00:10:32.299,THERE'S MONEY TO SPEND.
00:10:32.382,00:10:35.093,"IF THE DEMOCRATS LOSE PENNSYLVANIA, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS."
00:10:35.176,00:10:37.678,"WE DON'T WANT YOU TO LOSE LEADERSHIP, BUT THAT'S UP TO YOU, NOT US."
00:10:37.762,00:10:43.226,YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REPUBLICANS THAT YOU HAVE WITH ME.
00:10:43.310,00:10:44.769,THEN WE'LL ADAPT.
00:10:48.982,00:10:50.442,WE BOTH HAVE VOTES TO COUNT. GOOD LUCK.
00:10:50.525,00:10:52.860,YOU TELL SANCORP THEY'RE BEING FOOLISH.
00:10:52.944,00:10:54.362,I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.
00:10:54.446,00:10:55.989,"WELL, THEN, YOU'RE BEING FOOLISH."
00:10:56.072,00:10:57.991,"COME ON, FRANK."
00:10:58.074,00:10:59.993,LET'S NOT MAKE THIS PERSONAL.
00:11:00.076,00:11:02.621,I CAN'T COMPETE WITH SANCORP'S WAR CHEST.
00:11:04.705,00:11:09.169,TO PICK OFF THE OPPOSITION ONE BY ONE LIKE A SNIPER IN THE WOODS.
00:11:09.252,00:11:13.256,"THERE WILL COME A TIME TO PUT REMY IN MY CROSSHAIRS, BUT NOT RIGHT NOW."
00:11:13.340,00:11:17.969,"AS WE USED TO SAY IN GAFFNEY, NEVER SLAP A MAN WHILE HE'S CHEWING TOBACCO."
00:11:49.334,00:11:53.171,"I DEEPLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME OUT OF YOUR SCHEDULE-- HANK, I NEED TO EAT."
00:11:53.254,00:11:55.840,"SEE IF YOU CAN MUSTER UP A CLUB SANDWICH, EXTRA BACON."
00:12:06.560,00:12:09.020,FUCK ME.
00:12:10.980,00:12:14.108,TA-DA. THAI CUISINE AGAIN.
00:12:14.192,00:12:17.612,"THE GREEN CURRY IS FOR YOU, AND THE OTHER GREEN CURRY IS FOR ME."
00:12:17.696,00:12:19.155,I WAS ACTUALLY JUST ON MY WAY OUT.
00:12:19.239,00:12:21.115,I BOUGHT YOU DINNER. YOU HAVE TO EAT IT.
00:12:21.199,00:12:22.950,"OR AT THE VERY LEAST, YOU HAVE TO WATCH ME EAT MINE."
00:12:23.034,00:12:24.494,I'M GONNA BE LATE TO MEET SOMEONE.
00:12:24.578,00:12:27.706,- WHO? LIKE A DATE? - A FRIEND.
00:12:27.788,00:12:31.959,"OH, THE MYSTERIOUS FUCK-BUDDY WHO YOU GET ALL OF YOUR STORIES FROM?"
00:12:33.836,00:12:36.839,LIGHTEN UP. I WAS JUST TEASING.
00:12:36.923,00:12:40.552,NOT THAT I WOULD JUDGE. WE'VE ALL DONE IT.
00:12:40.635,00:12:45.348,"I USED TO SUCK, SCREW, AND JERK ANYTHING THAT MOVED JUST TO GET A STORY."
00:12:45.432,00:12:47.808,REALLY? LIKE WHO?
00:12:47.892,00:12:49.603,YOU WANT DISH?
00:12:49.686,00:12:53.565,NO. IT'S JUST-- THE COM DIRECTOR ON BEN SCHROEDER'S SENATE RACE.
00:12:53.648,00:12:55.816,A STAFFER IN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT.
00:12:55.900,00:12:57.860,MY VERY OWN WHITE HOUSE INTERN.
00:12:57.944,00:13:00.488,HE WAS A REAL BLABBERMOUTH WHEN HE WASN'T EATING ME OUT.
00:13:00.572,00:13:02.115,WOW.
00:13:02.198,00:13:06.244,AND I EVEN HAD A FLING WITH A CONGRESSMAN.
00:13:08.747,00:13:10.164,WHICH ONE?
00:13:13.293,00:13:14.502,I'VE NEVER BEEN WITH ANY.
00:13:16.421,00:13:19.257,YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT NONE OF THEM HAVE COME ON TO YOU?
00:13:21.217,00:13:22.761,YOU ARE NOW.
00:13:22.843,00:13:24.471,I GUESS I DON'T REALLY GIVE OFF THAT VIBE.
00:13:26.765,00:13:28.475,"LOOK, I DON'T DO THAT SHIT ANYMORE."
00:13:28.558,00:13:33.229,"'CAUSE ONCE WORD GOT OUT, IT WAS LIKE I HIT A WALL, AND NOBODY TOOK ME SERIOUSLY."
00:13:33.313,00:13:39.653,"SO, A PIECE OF ADVICE AS FAR AS CAREER STRATEGIES GO: IT'S NOT WORTH FUCKING YOUR WAY TO THE MIDDLE."
00:13:39.736,00:13:41.780,CHOPSTICKS OR FORK?
00:13:48.328,00:13:50.371,NO. I'LL EAT WITH YOU.
00:13:50.455,00:13:51.498,GOOD.
00:14:25.657,00:14:27.283,"BACK HOME, MEECHUM."
00:14:27.367,00:14:28.702,SIR.
00:14:38.795,00:14:40.463,FRANCIS...
00:14:42.965,00:14:44.884,HOW'S YOUR HAND?
00:14:44.967,00:14:46.427,FINE.
00:14:48.638,00:14:50.890,"YOU SHOULD CHANGE THE BANDAGE, NO?"
00:14:50.973,00:14:53.601,LATER.
00:14:53.685,00:14:55.687,I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BE OUT LATE.
00:14:55.770,00:14:57.689,NO.
00:14:57.772,00:15:00.233,- YOU SEEM UPSET. - I'M NOT.
00:15:07.198,00:15:09.242,I'M JUST TRYING TO RELAX.
00:15:13.954,00:15:17.584,"CLAIRE, I LOVE YOU."
00:15:17.667,00:15:19.502,"I LOVE YOU, TOO."
00:15:22.338,00:15:25.925,DID ZOE EXPECT ME TO TWIDDLE MY THUMBS UNTIL HER ARRIVAL?
00:15:26.008,00:15:29.929,PERHAPS SHE'S MAKING THE MISTAKE THINKING HER TIME IS AS VALUABLE AS MINE.
00:15:30.012,00:15:33.683,PROXIMITY TO POWER DELUDES SOME INTO BELIEVING THEY WIELD IT.
00:15:33.767,00:15:37.061,I PUT AN END TO THAT SORT OF THINKING BEFORE IT BEGINS.
00:15:48.239,00:15:52.660,"WELL, BUDDY HAD TO EAT HIS HAT AND BOTH HIS SHOES WHEN I WON THE COUNTY IN A LANDSLIDE."
00:15:52.744,00:15:56.873,"AND LET ME TELL YOU, THAT MAN HAS BIG FEET AND AN EVEN BIGGER HEAD, SO THAT WAS QUITE A MEAL."
00:16:00.835,00:16:07.216,MY DADDY USED TO TELL ME A STORY ABOUT PEOPLE WHO COUNT THEIR CHICKENS BEFORE THEY HATCHED.
00:16:07.300,00:16:11.721,"ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, HE PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT, BECAUSE HE GREW UP IN PITTSBURGH."
00:16:11.805,00:16:19.896,"AND I CERTAINLY NEVER SAW A HEN AROUND MY HOUSE, - DO YOU WANT ME TO DO SOMETHING? - BUT, SERIOUSLY, FOLKS..."
00:16:19.979,00:16:22.732,- NO. LET HIM TALK. - ...I DO LOVE THIS TOWN...
00:16:22.816,00:16:24.651,I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S EVER GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU.
00:16:27.654,00:16:30.698,IT'S BEEN AN HOUR. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE FOR CARBONDALE TEN MINUTES AGO.
00:16:30.782,00:16:32.742,I CAN'T INTERRUPT HIM. HE'S THE VICE PRESIDENT.
00:16:37.497,00:16:41.918,WE NEED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FLOWCHARTS FOR THE WATERSHED BILL SENT OVER TO TERRY WOMACK'S OFFICE.
00:16:42.001,00:16:44.211,"- HARD COPIES, 20 OF THEM. - I'LL DO IT RIGHT AWAY."
00:16:44.295,00:16:47.089,HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING WITH RACHEL?
00:16:47.173,00:16:49.509,I THINK SHE'S A LITTLE DOWN IN THE DUMPS.
00:16:49.592,00:16:51.970,"SHE GOT A WAITRESSING JOB LAST WEEK, AND THEN THEY LET HER GO."
00:16:52.052,00:16:53.638,- WHY? - SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME.
00:16:53.721,00:16:55.682,ALL SHE SAID WAS HER BOSS WAS A CREEP.
00:17:03.314,00:17:06.359,"THIRTY MINUTES AGO, I RECEIVED A TEXT FROM ZOE."
00:17:06.442,00:17:08.611,"SHE INTENDS TO APOLOGIZE, NO DOUBT."
00:17:08.695,00:17:14.158,"I RESPECT THAT SHE WANTS TO ATONE IN PERSON, EVEN THOUGH IT'S TAKEN HER OVER 16 HOURS TO BUILD UP THE COURAGE."
00:17:33.511,00:17:35.179,WHAT IN PARTICULAR?
00:17:36.890,00:17:38.599,SHE HAVE AN ANGLE?
00:17:38.683,00:17:42.228,THE WATERSHED BILL IS A CONSOLATION PRIZE FOR THEM LOSING THEIR JOBS.
00:17:43.730,00:17:47.107,"SHE THINKS IF THE BILL FAILS TO PASS, THEY'LL WITHDRAW SUPPORT."
00:17:47.191,00:17:50.028,NOT AN UNFAIR SPECULATION.
00:17:50.110,00:17:56.116,"WELL, I KNOW HOW HARD YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON HIS CAMPAIGN, SO I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A HEADS-UP."
00:17:56.200,00:17:58.786,"WELL, LET ME KNOW IF SHE EXPANDS HER INQUIRY."
00:18:02.122,00:18:04.042,"WELL, CAN I THROW HER A BONE?"
00:18:04.124,00:18:06.836,SHE MIGHT BE MORE TALKATIVE IF I HAVE INFORMATION FOR HER.
00:18:06.920,00:18:09.463,- WHAT SORT OF BONE? - THE VOTE COUNT FOR THE BILL.
00:18:11.382,00:18:13.718,SHOULD HAVE A PRELIMINARY ONE THIS AFTERNOON.
00:18:13.801,00:18:16.429,- YOU'LL LET ME KNOW? - AS SOON AS I HAVE SOMETHING SOLID.
00:18:16.512,00:18:18.556,THERE'S ONE MORE THING.
00:18:20.433,00:18:23.853,"ABOUT LAST NIGHT-- OH, NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE."
00:18:23.937,00:18:25.939,I'M SURE YOU HAD A VERY GOOD REASON.
00:18:27.982,00:18:30.150,I DO.
00:18:30.234,00:18:33.654,I THINK WE SHOULD END IT.
00:18:33.738,00:18:37.241,"NOT PROFESSIONALLY, THE OTHER THING."
00:18:47.460,00:18:50.004,WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP.
00:18:50.088,00:18:53.173,I DON'T WANNA OVERCOMPLICATE THAT.
00:18:53.257,00:18:55.969,ALL RIGHT.
00:18:56.052,00:18:58.596,- YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT? - COMPLETELY.
00:18:58.679,00:19:01.307,IT'S OVER.
00:19:01.390,00:19:04.143,AND IT WON'T CHANGE THINGS IN TERMS OF OUR ARRANGEMENT?
00:19:04.226,00:19:08.522,"OH, PLEASE. I DON'T PUNISH PEOPLE FOR MAKING ADULT DECISIONS."
00:19:11.484,00:19:13.319,"THANK YOU, FRANCIS."
00:19:21.494,00:19:24.998,SHE WAS NEVER MORE THAN A FAINT BLIP ON MY RADAR.
00:19:25.081,00:19:27.249,WE'VE SERVED EACH OTHER'S PURPOSE.
00:19:27.333,00:19:33.172,"IF SHE WANTS TO BE AN ADULT, LET HER SEE HOW SHE CAN FLY ONCE SHE LEAVES THE NEST."
00:19:45.184,00:19:47.394,- CLAIRE. - CATHERINE.
00:19:47.478,00:19:49.396,HI.
00:19:49.480,00:19:51.816,THANK YOU FOR FITTING ME IN.
00:19:51.899,00:19:55.111,"OH, I CAN ALWAYS FIND TIME FOR YOU AND FRANK."
00:19:57.571,00:20:09.583,"WELL, THE REASON I'M HERE IS THE C.W.I. HAS A LARGE SHIPMENT OF WATER FILTERS STUCK IN SOUTH SUDAN, AND THEY'VE BEEN IN STORAGE FOR THE PAST FOUR MONTHS, JUST SITTING THERE, AND THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT-- WON'T RELEASE THE SHIPMENTS THROUGH CUSTOMS."
00:20:09.667,00:20:11.752,MY DEPUTY BRIEFED ME ON THE LATEST.
00:20:11.836,00:20:17.925,"RIGHT. AND I KNOW THAT FRANCIS SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT THIS NOT TOO LONG AGO, BUT LATELY WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT, SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD HELP."
00:20:18.009,00:20:20.427,"WE'VE DONE OUR BEST, CLAIRE. I PUT MY TOP PEOPLE ON THIS."
00:20:20.511,00:20:22.596,THE SUDANESE ARE JUST NOT RESPONDING.
00:20:22.680,00:20:24.849,"WELL, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN DO?"
00:20:24.932,00:20:27.643,"THERE'S OVER $200,000 WORTH OF EQUIPMENT."
00:20:27.727,00:20:32.272,"I WISH I COULD. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO YOU, BUT WE'RE ABOUT TO CUT OFF DIPLOMATIC TIES."
00:20:32.356,00:20:33.983,IT'S A DIRECTIVE STRAIGHT FROM THE PRESIDENT.
00:20:34.067,00:20:37.695,WE CAN'T IGNORE THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ANYMORE.
00:20:37.778,00:20:39.363,WHAT ABOUT BACK CHANNELS?
00:20:39.446,00:20:44.284,"WELL, ONCE WE CUT TIES, I CAN'T CONTACT THEIR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALLY OR UNOFFICIALLY."
00:20:44.368,00:20:46.662,"WELL, IS THERE SOMEONE YOU COULD PUT ME IN TOUCH WITH?"
00:20:46.746,00:20:49.874,"I'M SORRY, CLAIRE. MY HANDS ARE TIED."
00:20:49.957,00:20:53.878,"I WOULD MOVE MOUNTAINS FOR YOU AND FRANK, BUT I'VE DONE ALL I CAN."
00:20:55.629,00:20:57.590,OF COURSE.
00:20:57.673,00:20:59.842,- OKAY. GOOD TO SEE YOU. - YOU TOO.
00:21:03.096,00:21:04.805,GOING TO THE FLOOR LATER THIS WEEK.
00:21:04.889,00:21:07.100,- ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC IT'LL PASS? - I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC.
00:21:07.183,00:21:14.023,"THE DELAWARE RIVER WATERSHED ACT NOT ONLY PROTECTS LARGE PORTIONS OF THE STATE'S FRESHWATER RESOURCES, IT ALSO CREATES THOUSANDS OF JOBS."
00:21:14.107,00:21:16.901,I'M CONFIDENT THAT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE HILL-- THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO CREATE JOBS.
00:21:16.984,00:21:18.736,I DID IT DURING MY ADMINISTRATION.
00:21:18.819,00:21:21.614,THE ANSWER IS TAX CREDITS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.
00:21:21.697,00:21:31.207,"YOU'VE GOT TO ENCOURAGE SELF-STARTING ENTREPRENEURS TO START NEW VENTURES, - HIRE EMPLOYEES-- - BUT SPECIFICALLY, - ABOUT THE WATERSHED ACT-- - SMALL BUSINESSES, THAT'S THE SOLUTION. EVERYTHING ELSE IS WINDOW DRESSING."
00:21:31.290,00:21:32.291,THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
00:21:33.584,00:21:35.044,THANK YOU.
00:21:36.212,00:21:37.379,"GOOD NIGHT, MR. VICE PRESIDENT."
00:21:42.551,00:21:44.303,HELLO.
00:21:46.597,00:21:49.225,"YES. I READ THE PRESS REPORTS. HE'S NOT BEING VERY HELPFUL, IS HE?"
00:21:49.308,00:21:51.560,HE'S DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD.
00:21:51.644,00:21:53.104,I WANT TO ASK HIM TO LEAVE.
00:21:53.187,00:21:54.772,"WELL, THAT WOULDN'T MAKE FOR A VERY GOOD STORY."
00:21:54.855,00:21:56.857,IT'S BETTER THAN HIM TORPEDOING THE WHOLE BUS TOUR.
00:21:56.941,00:21:58.276,HAVE YOU TRIED TO TALK TO HIM?
00:21:58.358,00:21:59.610,"NO, I WANTED TO ASK YOUR ADVICE FIRST."
00:21:59.693,00:22:04.865,"WELL, MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO KEEP HIM ON THE TOUR AND INSPIRE HIS SUPPORT."
00:22:04.949,00:22:06.867,WE HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT VIEWS.
00:22:06.951,00:22:10.329,"WELL, LOOK, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE CHANGE HIS IDEOLOGY, BUT DIG DEEPER."
00:22:10.412,00:22:14.708,JIM IS A PROUD MAN. TAP INTO THAT PRIDE.
00:22:14.792,00:22:16.210,I JUST WISH HE WAS GONE.
00:22:16.294,00:22:17.670,"WELL, YOU DO WHATEVER YOU THINK BEST."
00:22:17.753,00:22:21.215,"BUT WHATEVER IT IS YOU DECIDE, BE FIRM AND STAND UP FOR YOURSELF."
00:22:21.299,00:22:23.009,HE'LL RESPOND TO THAT AT LEAST.
00:22:23.092,00:22:24.969,AND CALL ME BACK IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
00:22:32.935,00:22:36.522,NO. THE HEAD WAITER SAID I WAS DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB.
00:22:36.605,00:22:39.108,HE EVEN STARTED LETTING ME TAKE MY OWN TABLES ON THE SECOND DAY.
00:22:39.192,00:22:41.735,AND THE MANAGER-- WHAT'S HIS NAME?
00:22:41.819,00:22:43.654,LEON.
00:22:43.737,00:22:46.240,HE PROPOSITIONED YOU?
00:22:46.324,00:22:54.540,"CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE, SAID COULDN'T AFFORD TO START TAKING ANYONE NEW ON, EVEN PART-TIME."
00:22:54.623,00:22:58.252,"PUT HIS HAND ON MY KNEE, SAID HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION."
00:22:58.336,00:23:01.172,SO HE STARTED SLIDING HIS HAND UP MY THIGH.
00:23:01.255,00:23:04.300,SO I STOOD UP AND I TELL HIM I SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK.
00:23:07.970,00:23:10.973,DID YOU?
00:23:11.057,00:23:16.687,"NO, I WALKED OUT OF THE OFFICE AND GOT BACK TO MY TABLES."
00:23:16.770,00:23:20.316,"NEXT DAY, I CAME INTO WORK, TOLD ME TO GO HOME."
00:23:20.398,00:23:21.817,I WAS FIRED.
00:23:24.237,00:23:26.488,TELL ME THE NAME OF THE RESTAURANT.
00:23:31.160,00:23:33.829,YOU'RE HOME EARLY.
00:23:33.913,00:23:35.206,I NEEDED A BREATHER.
00:23:35.289,00:23:36.790,I DIDN'T HAVE BREAKFAST THIS MORNING.
00:23:36.874,00:23:39.293,I MIGHT HEAD BACK IN A LITTLE WHILE.
00:23:39.377,00:23:42.213,THE VOTE COUNT?
00:23:42.296,00:23:45.132,IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE WIRE ON THIS ONE.
00:23:49.095,00:23:51.264,I SPOKE TO CATHERINE DURANT TODAY.
00:23:51.347,00:23:53.974,SHE'S UNABLE TO GET THE SHIPMENT OUT OF SOUTH SUDAN.
00:23:54.058,00:23:55.893,"YEAH, WE'RE CUTTING ALL DIPLOMATIC TIES."
00:23:57.811,00:24:01.148,"YES. WHICH IS WHY SHE CAN'T LIFT A FINGER, ACCORDING TO HER."
00:24:01.232,00:24:04.277,"IT'S WHAT SHE SAID, ANYWAY. ANYWAY, I NEED YOU TO TALK TO HER."
00:24:04.360,00:24:05.736,I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
00:24:09.698,00:24:10.950,SHE'S SECRETARY OF STATE.
00:24:11.033,00:24:12.034,SHE CAN'T BREAK DIPLOMATIC PROTOCOL.
00:24:12.118,00:24:14.328,"WELL, CAN YOU MAKE SOME CALLS?"
00:24:14.412,00:24:17.623,"IF SHE CAN'T, I CAN'T. PLUS I HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE WATERSHED BILL."
00:24:17.706,00:24:20.960,I'M TAKING TIME OUT OF MY SCHEDULE TO HELP YOU WITH THAT.
00:24:21.043,00:24:23.003,- BECAUSE YOU DRAFTED IT. - BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME.
00:24:23.087,00:24:25.214,I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS.
00:24:25.298,00:24:28.134,ALL I'M ASKING IS THAT YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR TIME IN RETURN.
00:24:28.217,00:24:30.010,AND HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIX A PROBLEM I CAN'T FIX?
00:24:30.094,00:24:32.263,WHAT ABOUT REMY?
00:24:32.346,00:24:35.391,GLENDON HILL MUST HAVE CONTACTS IN SOUTH SUDAN.
00:24:36.934,00:24:39.312,THOSE ARE TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE ISSUES.
00:24:39.395,00:24:42.815,"THEY ARE NOT. HE DOES YOU A FAVOR, HE HANGS IT OVER ME."
00:24:45.276,00:24:48.028,SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS MY GOALS ARE SECONDARY TO YOURS.
00:24:48.112,00:24:49.780,THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
00:24:49.863,00:24:52.783,I THINK YOU DON'T WANT TO GO HAT IN HAND TO SOMEBODY WHO USED TO WORK FOR YOU.
00:24:52.908,00:24:55.828,I WILL NOT BE LECTURED TO THE MOMENT YOU WALK IN THE DOOR!
00:24:55.911,00:24:58.038,"I CALLED CATHERINE, AS PROMISED!"
00:24:58.122,00:25:01.167,HER INABILITY TO DELIVER IS NOT MY PROBLEM OR MY FAULT!
00:25:01.250,00:25:03.627,I CANNOT CONTROL CHANGING GLOBAL LANDSCAPES!
00:25:03.710,00:25:07.965,AND I WILL NOT BE CORNERED INTO MAKING PROMISES I CANNOT DELIVER!
00:25:16.307,00:25:18.725,I'M SORRY I YELLED.
00:25:20.769,00:25:22.729,I'M UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.
00:25:24.148,00:25:26.692,"YOU'RE RIGHT, I DIDN'T THINK IT THROUGH."
00:25:28.444,00:25:30.237,I JUST CAN'T GO TO REMY RIGHT NOW.
00:25:30.321,00:25:31.529,HE'S POACHING TOO MANY OF MY PEOPLE.
00:25:36.243,00:25:38.620,I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT SPEAK TO THEM.
00:25:40.206,00:25:41.207,WHO?
00:25:41.290,00:25:43.167,VANDERBURGH AND ABRAMS.
00:25:43.250,00:25:45.461,WHAT IS IT YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO THEM?
00:25:48.047,00:25:49.215,THEY RESPECT YOUR OPINION.
00:25:49.298,00:25:51.300,I WANTED YOU TO WALK THEM THROUGH THE BILL STEP-BY-STEP.
00:25:54.178,00:25:56.389,I MEET WITH THEM TOMORROW. I'LL DELIVER THE BRUISES.
00:25:56.472,00:25:58.015,YOU MEET WITH THEM LATER AND PATCH THEM UP.
00:25:58.098,00:25:59.975,THAT MIGHT JUST DO THE TRICK.
00:26:02.186,00:26:04.104,OF COURSE.
00:26:13.322,00:26:17.117,WE HAVE CONTACTS THERE THROUGH OUR OIL INTERESTS.
00:26:17.201,00:26:18.702,I'M GOING TO NEED GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION.
00:26:18.785,00:26:21.038,"WHEREVER THERE'S A GOVERNMENT, WE KNOW PEOPLE."
00:26:23.665,00:26:25.334,WILL YOU HELP ME?
00:26:25.418,00:26:27.711,I'D LIKE TO.
00:26:27.794,00:26:30.506,"BUT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS, I'M AFRAID THERE'S A PRICE TAG."
00:26:30.588,00:26:33.884,THE C.W.I. WILL ENDORSE SANCORP AS ECO-FRIENDLY.
00:26:33.967,00:26:36.011,THEY CAN USE OUR LOGO ON ANY P.R.
00:26:36.095,00:26:37.595,OR MARKETING MATERIALS YOU WANT.
00:26:37.679,00:26:39.515,WE'LL NEED MORE THAN THAT.
00:26:42.351,00:26:43.727,"THESE FILTERS ARE ONLY WORTH $200,000."
00:26:43.810,00:26:44.978,I'D SAY THAT'S A BARGAIN.
00:26:45.062,00:26:46.564,YOU TURNED DOWN THAT OFFER.
00:26:46.646,00:26:48.107,LANDSCAPE HAS SHIFTED SINCE THEN.
00:26:48.190,00:26:51.944,- THE WATERSHED BILL? - THAT'S RIGHT.
00:26:53.320,00:26:56.198,"I WANT YOU TO KILL IT, THE WHOLE THING."
00:26:56.282,00:27:00.035,"C.W.I. HAS PUBLICLY BACKED THE BILL, REMY."
00:27:00.119,00:27:03.122,WHAT YOU DO PUBLICLY IS YOUR CONCERN.
00:27:05.916,00:27:10.546,"GENTLEMEN. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT."
00:27:10.628,00:27:15.050,"SO, HAVE EITHER OF YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND SINCE WE LAST SPOKE?"
00:27:17.761,00:27:19.637,LEANING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER?
00:27:19.721,00:27:26.604,"IF CONGRESS IS GOING TO ALLOCATE A QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT GOES TOWARDS A BILL THAT DOES MORE TO PROTECT THE-- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ALL THAT. I KNOW YOUR CONCERNS."
00:27:26.686,00:27:32.485,"SO IF THE PROTECTION STANDARDS DON'T CHANGE, WE WOULD RATHER SEE THAT MONEY SPENT MORE EFFECTIVELY ELSEWHERE."
00:27:32.568,00:27:36.572,THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE BOTH LEANING NO.
00:27:41.368,00:27:43.036,OKAY.
00:27:46.664,00:27:48.875,"THIS IS YOU, ABRAMS."
00:27:48.959,00:27:52.129,"AND THIS IS YOU, VANDERBURGH."
00:27:52.212,00:27:54.006,AND OVER HERE...
00:28:01.888,00:28:04.433,IS THE MAJORITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS.
00:28:04.517,00:28:06.726,"SEE, YOU'RE OVER THERE ALL BY YOUR LONESOME."
00:28:06.810,00:28:09.062,"NOW, YOU DON'T MIND BEING THE BLACK SHEEP."
00:28:09.146,00:28:10.688,YOU'RE THE LIBERAL WING OF THE LIBERAL WING.
00:28:10.772,00:28:14.527,"MOST OF THE TIME YOU CAN VOTE WHAT YOU WANT, WE STILL PASS THINGS ANYWAY."
00:28:14.610,00:28:18.614,BUT THIS TIME IT DOES MATTER.
00:28:18.696,00:28:24.328,AND WHAT THE TWO OF YOU AREN'T TAKING INTO ACCOUNT IS BETWEEN THIS END OF THE DESK AND THIS END OF THE DESK...
00:28:24.453,00:28:25.538,IS ME.
00:28:25.621,00:28:29.375,"NOW, I'M GOING TO SAY TO YOU WHAT I SAY TO EVERY CONGRESSMAN THAT SITS WHERE YOU'RE SITTING NOW."
00:28:29.458,00:28:32.586,VOTE YOUR DISTRICT. VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE.
00:28:32.670,00:28:34.129,DON'T SURPRISE ME.
00:28:34.213,00:28:36.507,AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE OF THOSE...
00:28:38.925,00:28:42.429,IS DON'T SURPRISE ME.
00:28:42.513,00:28:44.640,"NOW, YOU'RE BOTH TO MEET WITH MY WIFE TOMORROW."
00:28:44.723,00:28:47.393,AND YOU'RE TO HEAR HER OUT.
00:28:47.476,00:28:50.145,SHE WILL GO THROUGH YOUR CONCERNS POINT-BY-POINT.
00:28:50.229,00:28:57.611,AND I AM CERTAIN AFTER THAT THAT THE TWO OF YOU WILL MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION.
00:29:00.698,00:29:02.949,THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU LEAVE.
00:29:09.748,00:29:14.420,I HAVE OFTEN FOUND THAT BLEEDING HEARTS HAVE A IRONIC FEAR OF THEIR OWN BLOOD.
00:29:14.503,00:29:16.380,ONE DROP AND THEY SEIZE UP.
00:29:24.346,00:29:25.889,HELLO.
00:29:25.972,00:29:27.057,I'VE JUST SPOKEN TO ABRAMS AND VANDERBURGH.
00:29:27.140,00:29:31.437,"LET THEM TOSS AND TURN TONIGHT, BUT THEY'RE ALL YOURS TOMORROW."
00:29:31.520,00:29:34.398,I'LL REACH OUT TO THEIR OFFICES AND SET A TIME.
00:29:34.481,00:29:36.442,"THANK YOU, CLAIRE."
00:29:36.525,00:29:39.861,OF COURSE. WHATEVER I CAN DO TO HELP.
00:29:43.699,00:29:45.618,"HERE YOU GO, SIR. ENJOY."
00:29:45.701,00:29:48.579,EXCUSE ME.
00:29:49.913,00:29:51.707,"I AM SO SORRY, SIR. WHERE?"
00:29:51.790,00:29:53.792,RIGHT THERE.
00:29:55.419,00:29:56.795,I DON'T SEE IT.
00:29:56.878,00:29:58.422,ARE YOU TELLING ME I'M BLIND?
00:29:58.505,00:30:00.048,"NO, SIR. I'M SO SORRY."
00:30:00.132,00:30:01.759,- I'LL HAVE THE KITCHEN. - WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
00:30:01.841,00:30:03.218,STEPHANIE.
00:30:03.302,00:30:05.011,"YOU CAN LEAVE THE PLATE, STEPHANIE."
00:30:05.095,00:30:06.179,I'D LIKE TO TALK TO THE MANAGER.
00:30:06.263,00:30:08.766,"YES, SIR. I'LL GO GET HIM."
00:30:08.848,00:30:10.517,THANK YOU.
00:30:20.152,00:30:21.695,"GOOD EVENING, SIR."
00:30:21.779,00:30:25.658,"UH, STEPHANIE TELLS ME THERE WAS A HAIR ON YOUR PLATE."
00:30:25.741,00:30:27.451,NO.
00:30:29.119,00:30:30.412,THERE WASN'T ANY HAIR.
00:30:30.496,00:30:31.705,"LEON, RIGHT? THAT'S YOUR NAME?"
00:30:31.789,00:30:33.373,YES.
00:30:37.336,00:30:38.504,NICE ASS.
00:30:40.088,00:30:44.760,DID YOU MAKE HER BLOW YOU BEFORE OR AFTER YOU HIRED HER?
00:30:44.843,00:30:47.179,"SIR, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE."
00:30:47.262,00:30:49.139,"- SIT DOWN, LEON. - SIR, I WANT YOU TO GO."
00:30:49.222,00:30:51.350,- I SAID SIT. - DON'T MAKE ME CALL THE POLICE.
00:30:51.433,00:30:58.816,"I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. YOU CALL THE POLICE, I'LL CALL THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION ABOUT THE FOUR UNDOCUMENTED EMPLOYEES YOU HAVE WORKING IN THE KITCHEN."
00:30:58.940,00:30:59.941,"FELONY, LEON."
00:31:08.158,00:31:12.204,"PRISON TIME FOR YOU, DEPORTATION FOR THEM."
00:31:12.287,00:31:13.706,"NOT A PRETTY PICTURE, IS IT?"
00:31:24.466,00:31:27.093,LET'S TALK ABOUT RACHEL POSNER.
00:31:29.262,00:31:31.973,I SHOULD HAVE THE LAST TWO VOTES I NEED COMMITTED TODAY.
00:31:32.057,00:31:34.100,I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE NO ONE CHANGES THEIR MIND.
00:31:34.184,00:31:39.189,I'D PREFER NOT TO GET EMBROILED IN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AT THIS TIME.
00:31:39.272,00:31:41.066,BUT IT'S ALSO A JOBS-CREATION PACKAGE.
00:31:41.149,00:31:42.901,IT'S ANTAGONIZING OIL AND GAS.
00:31:42.984,00:31:46.154,WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT SORT OF BATTLE AFTER ALL THE CAPITAL WE SPENT ON EDUCATION.
00:31:46.238,00:31:49.533,ALL I NEED IS ONE PUBLIC STATEMENT OF SUPPORT.
00:31:49.616,00:31:51.869,I WON'T DO THAT. HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE LINDA TOMORROW.
00:31:51.951,00:31:53.203,SET HER UP IN YOUR OFFICES.
00:31:53.286,00:31:56.956,"ANY MEETINGS OR CALLS YOU MIGHT NEED TO WHIP UP VOTES, YOU GOT HER THERE."
00:31:57.040,00:31:58.917,"WELL, I CAN'T AFFORD TO SPEND A WHOLE DAY LOBBYING ON THE HILL."
00:31:59.000,00:32:00.210,"WELL, YOU GOT DEPUTIES."
00:32:02.003,00:32:04.631,"WELL, YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU CAN'T MANAGE THEM FROM TEN BLOCKS AWAY?"
00:32:04.715,00:32:06.049,"OF COURSE I CAN, SIR."
00:32:06.132,00:32:10.053,"LOOK, IF IT'S TOO DIFFICULT-- NO, NO, NO. WE'LL HELP YOU OUT, FRANK. WON'T WE, LINDA?"
00:32:10.136,00:32:14.015,"YES. IF YOU'LL JUST EXCUSE ME, I HAVE A FEW THINGS TO REARRANGE ON MY SCHEDULE."
00:32:14.099,00:32:17.477,"WHAT ELSE, FRANK? TELL ME WHAT BIRCH IS UP TO."
00:32:17.561,00:32:20.355,"NO, I KNOW I'VE ALREADY CANCELED TWICE."
00:32:20.480,00:32:22.566,THEY START NEXT WEEK.
00:32:22.649,00:32:24.234,"SWEETIE, I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT."
00:32:24.317,00:32:25.903,- LINDA. - EXCUSE ME.
00:32:25.985,00:32:29.615,"- YES? - I JUST WANTED THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO PITCH IN, I KNOW YOU HAVE A FULL PLATE."
00:32:30.949,00:32:36.162,IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? IT SOUNDS LIKE-- YES. WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT ME TO COME BY TOMORROW?
00:32:36.246,00:32:37.664,CAN WE TALK?
00:32:37.748,00:32:39.416,CAN I JUST CALL YOU BACK IN ONE SECOND?
00:32:39.499,00:32:42.836,I WILL CALL YOU. YES.
00:32:42.920,00:32:45.923,"LINDA, I AM SO SORRY THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS FORCED YOU INTO THIS."
00:32:46.005,00:32:47.382,IT WAS NOT MY INTENTION.
00:32:47.466,00:32:50.135,"IF YOU WOULD LIKE, I CAN TALK CONGRESS-- NO, IT'S NOT THAT."
00:32:52.512,00:32:53.889,"WELL, WHAT IS IT? MAYBE I CAN HELP."
00:32:53.972,00:32:56.349,JUST-- MY SON DIDN'T GET INTO STANFORD.
00:32:56.433,00:32:59.519,I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET WITH THE PROVOST TOMORROW TO SEE IF I COULD GET HIM TO CHANGE HIS MIND.
00:32:59.603,00:33:02.773,"I ASKED THE PRESIDENT IF I COULD GO, AND HE SAID YES, BUT HE MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN."
00:33:02.856,00:33:05.108,YOU SHOULD GO. I'M SURE THE PRESIDENT WILL UNDERSTAND.
00:33:05.191,00:33:07.778,"NO, NO. I DON'T LET PERSONAL MATTERS GET IN THE WAY OF MY JOB, FRANK."
00:33:07.861,00:33:09.863,"LINDA, YOU CAN'T PUT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE ON HOLD."
00:33:12.449,00:33:14.409,"WELL, IT HAS BEEN AT THE EXPENSE OF MY SON."
00:33:14.493,00:33:16.202,IT'S MY FAULT HE DIDN'T GET IN.
00:33:16.286,00:33:19.247,I WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN AND I WASN'T THERE FOR HIM.
00:33:19.331,00:33:24.544,"HIS GRADES SUFFERED. HIS APPLICATION WAS-- I WASN'T THERE, FRANK."
00:33:24.628,00:33:29.341,"BUT I FIGURED IF I COULD JUST MEET WITH THE PROVOST FACE-TO-FACE-- OKAY, LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO STANFORD TOMORROW."
00:33:29.424,00:33:32.845,"IF YOU SHOW UP AT MY OFFICE, I WON'T LET YOU IN, SO DON'T EVEN CONSIDER IT."
00:33:32.928,00:33:35.764,"FRANK, THE PRESIDENT WANTS ME TO BE-- HE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW."
00:33:35.848,00:33:40.477,I'M GOING TO HAVE ONE OF MY SCHEDULERS BUY YOU A TICKET. THE BILL WILL BE FINE.
00:33:40.560,00:33:44.314,FRANK. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
00:33:44.397,00:33:49.277,"WE MAY HAVE OUR DISAGREEMENTS, LINDA, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER."
00:33:49.361,00:33:52.030,YOU TELL THEM YOU'RE COMING.
00:33:54.658,00:33:57.202,"- OKAY. GIVE THAT A TRY. - TEST, TEST, TEST."
00:33:57.285,00:33:59.621,"ALL RIGHT, ZOE. THIS IS DAVE, THE SENIOR PRODUCER IN NEW YORK."
00:33:59.705,00:34:01.999,- WE'LL GO LIVE IN FOUR MINUTES. - SOUNDS GOOD.
00:34:02.081,00:34:09.006,"THE FIRST TOPIC WILL BE THE CONGRESSIONAL AGENDA FOR THE FALL SESSION, THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE MIDTERMS, THEN WE'LL WRAP IT UP WITH PETER RUSSO'S RACE FOR GOVERNOR AND HIS WATERSHED BILL."
00:34:09.088,00:34:12.009,"- OKAY, GREAT. - TAKING YOU OFF MIC UNTIL 30 OUT."
00:34:12.091,00:34:14.511,"HEY, JANINE, I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE WATERSHED BILL."
00:34:14.594,00:34:17.514,"- DO YOU HAVE A ONE-SHEET? - UH, YEAH. HOLD ON."
00:34:25.480,00:34:26.732,- THANKS. - MM-HMM.
00:34:26.815,00:34:28.650,ANY WORD ON THE VOTE COUNT?
00:34:28.734,00:34:34.113,"STILL NO LUCK. I'VE CALLED EVERY DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE TO COBBLE TOGETHER A NUMBER, BUT NO ONE'S GETTING BACK TO ME."
00:34:34.197,00:34:36.115,SO WHAT CAN I SAY?
00:34:36.199,00:34:39.202,"THAT THERE'S A LOT IN FLUX, AND IT'LL BE TIGHT."
00:34:39.285,00:34:40.787,OKAY. THANKS.
00:34:40.871,00:34:41.914,YEAH. SURE THING.
00:34:54.384,00:34:56.135,"HEY, FRANCIS, IT'S ME."
00:34:56.219,00:34:58.304,CALL ME BACK.
00:35:01.182,00:35:04.019,CONGRESSMAN RUSSO. HE SAYS IT'S URGENT.
00:35:08.523,00:35:10.067,"GOOD MORNING, SIR."
00:35:10.149,00:35:12.110,I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE TOUR'S GOING.
00:35:12.193,00:35:14.446,"WELL, LET'S TALK ON THE BUS. DON'T WE HAVE AN EVENT AT 11:00?"
00:35:14.529,00:35:16.031,THERE WON'T BE ANY EVENTS UNTIL WE TALK.
00:35:18.700,00:35:20.827,YOU'RE HIJACKING THE MICROPHONE.
00:35:20.911,00:35:22.704,YOU'RE CONTRADICTING EVERYTHING I SAY.
00:35:22.788,00:35:25.206,WE NEED TO BE PROMOTING THE WATERSHED ACT.
00:35:25.290,00:35:28.585,"WELL, I APPRECIATE YOUR BEING SO FORTHRIGHT."
00:35:28.668,00:35:31.922,LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I DON'T APPRECIATE.
00:35:32.005,00:35:37.844,"THE D.N.C. IS RUNNING A MAN WITH ZERO TRACK RECORD, EXCEPT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE, TO FILL MY SHOES."
00:35:37.928,00:35:42.474,"I REALIZE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HERE, SIR, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE DELIBERATELY TRYING TO SABOTAGE MY CAMPAIGN."
00:35:42.557,00:35:44.768,"DESPITE MY BETTER JUDGMENT, I'M TRYING TO SAVE IT."
00:35:44.851,00:35:47.186,"I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE BETTER THAN YOU, PETER."
00:35:47.270,00:35:49.522,THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WATERSHEDS. THEY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT JOBS.
00:35:50.983,00:35:54.903,"WELL, THEN, MAYBE I SHOULD JUST STAND QUIETLY BESIDE YOU AT THE PODIUM AND WATCH YOU LOSE."
00:35:54.987,00:35:56.780,"- YOU DON'T THINK I CAN WIN, DO YOU? - I'M NOT OPTIMISTIC."
00:35:56.863,00:35:59.365,YOU LOST THE FIRST TWO TIMES YOU RAN FOR GOVERNOR.
00:35:59.449,00:36:01.618,"THE THIRD TIME, NOBODY THOUGHT YOU HAD A CHANCE."
00:36:01.701,00:36:05.163,"BY SEPTEMBER, YOU WERE 15 POINTS DOWN. YOU WERE OUT OF MONEY."
00:36:05.246,00:36:07.707,YOU HAD TO MORTGAGE YOUR OWN HOUSE JUST TO KEEP YOUR STAFF ON PAYROLL.
00:36:07.791,00:36:09.918,I'M WELL AWARE OF WHAT I DID. I WAS THERE.
00:36:10.002,00:36:15.799,"MY POINT IS YOU KEPT GOING. YOU HIT 67 COUNTIES IN LESS THAN 20 DAYS, AND YOU PROVED EVERYONE WRONG."
00:36:15.882,00:36:20.720,"LIKE IT OR NOT, IT'S MY NAME ON THE TICKET THIS TIME, AND I GOT THE SHOT, AND I'M GONNA PROVE EVERYONE WRONG."
00:36:20.804,00:36:22.555,"JUST LIKE YOU DID. INCLUDING YOU, SIR."
00:36:22.639,00:36:27.268,"I WOULD LIKE YOUR SUPPORT, BUT IF YOU WON'T GIVE IT, FINE."
00:36:27.352,00:36:29.187,IT WON'T STOP ME.
00:36:33.150,00:36:36.028,YOU THINK IT'S EASY FOR ME TO BE HERE?
00:36:36.111,00:36:38.488,I LEFT THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION RIGHT IN MY PRIME.
00:36:38.571,00:36:40.490,TO BE WHAT? VICE PRESIDENT.
00:36:40.573,00:36:42.993,I THOUGHT THAT WAS A STEP UP. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
00:36:43.076,00:36:45.203,I DON'T HAVE A FUCKING SHRED OF REAL INFLUENCE.
00:36:45.286,00:36:50.291,"I'M TROTTED AROUND LIKE A GODDAMN MASCOT, AND THIS IS MY HOME STATE."
00:36:50.375,00:36:52.919,"I'M OFFERING YOU INFLUENCE, SIR."
00:36:58.424,00:37:00.593,"BUT IF THAT'S NOT ON THE TABLE, THEN, WELL..."
00:37:00.677,00:37:05.932,"WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOU SHOULD HEAD BACK TO WASHINGTON."
00:37:18.195,00:37:19.988,I WOULD CATEGORIZE IT AS A THREAT.
00:37:20.072,00:37:23.825,- WHAT DID HE SAY EXACTLY? - NOT TO SURPRISE HIM.
00:37:23.909,00:37:26.661,DIDN'T HE ALSO TELL YOU TO VOTE YOUR DISTRICT AND YOUR CONSCIENCE?
00:37:26.745,00:37:31.290,"HE DID, BUT THOSE SEEMED FAR LOWER ON HIS PRIORITY LIST."
00:37:31.374,00:37:35.378,"WELL, HE WOULD NEVER FAULT YOU IF YOU HAD A COMPELLING REASON TO DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT."
00:37:38.131,00:37:40.967,C.W.I. IS PUBLICLY FOR IT.
00:37:44.303,00:37:48.600,I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT WE WERE HERE SO YOU COULD PERSUADE US TO VOTE YES.
00:37:48.683,00:37:51.228,"OH, I'M NOT TRYING TO PERSUADE YOU OF ANYTHING."
00:37:51.310,00:37:56.191,"I WILL SAY THIS: IF THE BILL FAILS, IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD."
00:37:58.818,00:38:01.905,"YOU KNOW, SOMETHING WITH STRICTER REGULATORY STANDARDS."
00:38:01.988,00:38:05.366,"JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU'RE TELLING US YOU DON'T MIND IF WE VOTE AGAINST THE BILL."
00:38:05.450,00:38:11.664,I'M SIMPLY SAYING WHAT MY HUSBAND WOULD-- THAT YOU SHOULD VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE.
00:38:13.416,00:38:15.501,- HOW ARE WE LOOKING? - WE'RE SHORT A VOTE.
00:38:15.585,00:38:16.920,JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH CLAIRE.
00:38:17.003,00:38:18.546,VANDERBURGH AND ABRAMS ARE ON BOARD.
00:38:18.630,00:38:20.590,- THOSE ARE DEFINITE YESES? - DEFINITE.
00:38:20.673,00:38:22.592,WE SHOULD BE GOOD.
00:38:22.675,00:38:24.219,YES?
00:38:24.302,00:38:26.221,I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU SINCE YESTERDAY.
00:38:28.389,00:38:29.933,YOU SAID YOU'D HAVE A NUMBER FOR ME.
00:38:30.016,00:38:31.684,"WELL, YOU SHOULD TRY MY PRESS OFFICE."
00:38:31.768,00:38:33.770,I DID. THEY WON'T RETURN MY CALLS.
00:38:33.853,00:38:36.355,"WELL, THE OFFICIAL WORD IS IT WILL BE CLOSE."
00:38:36.439,00:38:38.066,I'M TRYING TO GET THE UNOFFICIAL WORD.
00:38:38.150,00:38:40.777,"OH, I CAN'T APPEAR TO BE PLAYING FAVORITES NOW, CAN I?"
00:38:40.860,00:38:43.529,"THIS ISN'T BECAUSE OF THE OTHER DAY, IS IT?"
00:38:43.613,00:38:46.241,WHAT OTHER DAY?
00:38:46.324,00:38:48.785,YOU SAID WE'D KEEP OUR PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP.
00:38:48.868,00:38:51.121,"WELL, THIS IS WHAT PROFESSIONAL FEELS LIKE."
00:39:05.677,00:39:07.262,THANK YOU.
00:39:07.345,00:39:10.056,IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK IN BRISTOL.
00:39:15.145,00:39:18.064,"NOW, YOU ALL KNOW ME. I'M A WINDBAG."
00:39:18.148,00:39:25.280,"I CAN GO ON UNTIL YOU ALL FALL ASLEEP, GET EIGHT HOURS OF SHUT-EYE, AND WAKE UP TO FIND ME STILL YAPPING."
00:39:25.363,00:39:28.950,AND THERE'S A LOT I COULD SAY ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN TO MY LEFT.
00:39:29.034,00:39:37.000,"THE TRUTH IS, I'VE HAD A LOT OF DOUBTS ABOUT HIM AND HIS IDEAS, ABOUT HIS PAST, ABOUT HIS YOUTH."
00:39:37.083,00:39:42.297,"BUT IF YOU'LL REMEMBER, A LOT OF YOU HAD DOUBTS ABOUT ME THE FIRST TIME I RAN."
00:39:42.380,00:39:45.300,AND THE SECOND. AND THE THIRD.
00:39:47.135,00:39:54.600,"BUT OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, TRAVELING AROUND THE STATE WITH PETER, I HAVE TO ADMIT HE'S WON ME OVER."
00:39:54.684,00:40:03.401,"HE'S SMART, HE'S ENERGETIC, NOW, IT SAYS A FRESH START ON THAT BUS OVER THERE."
00:40:03.484,00:40:09.448,"AND THAT'S THE REAL TRUTH, BECAUSE THIS YOUNG MAN WILL GIVE OUR STATE THE FRESH START IT SO DESPERATELY NEEDS."
00:40:09.532,00:40:13.745,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA, PETER RUSSO."
00:40:22.628,00:40:25.131,"THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT."
00:40:25.215,00:40:26.799,"HOW'S IT GOING, BRISTOL?"
00:40:28.718,00:40:32.347,TODAY I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT ECONOMIC RECOVERY.
00:40:32.430,00:40:42.190,"NOW, AS MANY OF YOU MAY BE AWARE, MOSTLY BECAUSE MY OPPONENT FEELS THE NEED TO SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON TV ADS ABOUT MY PAST, I KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT RECOVERY."
00:40:42.274,00:40:46.194,I'VE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL THROUGH MY PERSONAL STRUGGLES.
00:40:46.278,00:41:00.375,"I'VE LEARNED HOW TO HARNESS MY STRENGTH AND MY RESOLVE, MAKE THEM WORK FOR ME, MUCH THE WAY YOUR BRISTOL WATERMILLS HARNESSED THE POWER OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL OTTER CREEK AND THE MIGHTY DELAWARE RIVER YEARS AGO."
00:41:00.458,00:41:06.172,LET ME TELL YOU HOW THE DELAWARE RIVER WILL REINVIGORATE YOUR ECONOMY FOR YEARS TO COME!
00:41:11.386,00:41:13.430,WE'RE GOING TO GET THE SHIPMENT OUT OF SUDAN.
00:41:13.512,00:41:20.312,"- THAT'S GREAT. - IT MIGHT TAKE A FEW WEEKS, BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD START MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR BOTSWANA, WHERE YOU'RE GONNA SET UP BASE CAMP AND THE DEPOT."
00:41:20.395,00:41:23.773,JUST SEND ME A BUDGET AS SOON AS YOU'VE GOT ONE.
00:41:23.856,00:41:27.986,"CLAIRE, IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN SEND SOMEONE IN MY PLACE?"
00:41:28.069,00:41:29.988,I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO BE ON THE GROUND.
00:41:30.071,00:41:32.782,"I WOULD, BUT I CAN'T THIS TIME."
00:41:32.865,00:41:34.784,WHY NOT?
00:41:34.867,00:41:39.956,"I WASN'T SURE HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT I PASSED THE 12-WEEK MARK."
00:41:42.417,00:41:45.003,YOU'RE EXPECTING.
00:41:45.086,00:41:49.257,"GILLIAN, THAT'S WONDERFUL. THAT-- WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN? WHO'S THE FATHER?"
00:41:49.341,00:41:52.385,THERE WAS THIS GUY I MET OVERSEAS. DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS.
00:41:52.469,00:41:54.846,WE HAD THIS THING. THEN I LEFT.
00:41:59.434,00:42:02.895,"ANYWAY, IT DIDN'T END WELL. BUT I WANT TO KEEP THE BABY."
00:42:02.979,00:42:06.107,- AND DOES HE KNOW? - HE'S MARRIED.
00:42:06.191,00:42:08.485,- OH. - I SHOULDN'T HAVE. IT WAS STUPID.
00:42:11.029,00:42:13.948,I'LL NEED SOME TIME OFF AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH.
00:42:14.032,00:42:15.574,OF COURSE.
00:42:15.658,00:42:18.870,"AND ABSOLUTELY, WE'LL SEND SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD."
00:42:18.953,00:42:20.872,"I APPRECIATE IT, CLAIRE."
00:42:20.955,00:42:22.207,SURE.
00:42:28.380,00:42:30.882,YOU SAID MEDIUM-RARE?
00:42:30.965,00:42:33.259,"JUST, UH, LET ME KNOW IF YOU GUYS NEED ANYTHING."
00:42:58.117,00:43:00.953,WHO WOULD YOU GUESS TEXTED ME JUST NOW?
00:43:01.037,00:43:03.706,I THOUGHT SHE'D LAST MORE THAN A COUPLE DAYS.
00:43:07.252,00:43:09.379,- GOING SOMEWHERE? - JUST FOR AN HOUR OR TWO.
00:43:09.462,00:43:11.589,I GOT ONE LAST HOLDOUT TO WHIP.
00:43:57.843,00:43:59.762,BEFORE WE DIRTY OURSELVES WITH BUSINESS?
00:43:59.845,00:44:01.722,I'LL SHOWER AFTER YOU LEAVE.
00:44:01.806,00:44:04.976,WHAT'S THE VOTE COUNT?
00:44:05.059,00:44:08.271,YOUR TONE DOESN'T INSPIRE ME TO BE VERY FORTHCOMING.
00:44:08.354,00:44:10.398,"OH, THE FUCK WASN'T ENOUGH?"
00:44:10.482,00:44:12.691,"YOU NEED A SPECIAL TONE, TOO?"
00:44:12.775,00:44:17.113,"OOH, SOMEONE WASHED HER MOUTH OUT WITH ACID THIS MORNING."
00:44:17.196,00:44:21.409,"WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE GRAPPLING WITH, I AM SINCERELY NOT INTERESTED."
00:44:21.493,00:44:22.994,YOU'RE ALMOST TWICE MY AGE.
00:44:24.662,00:44:26.581,YOU SAID THAT DIDN'T BOTHER YOU.
00:44:26.664,00:44:28.207,I LIED.
00:44:28.291,00:44:30.627,"IF YOU HAD A DAUGHTER, SHE'D BE OLDER THAN ME."
00:44:30.709,00:44:33.630,"IN 20 YEARS, I'LL STILL BE YOUNGER THAN YOU ARE NOW."
00:44:33.712,00:44:36.048,"WELL, I CAN'T ARGUE WITH BASIC ARITHMETIC."
00:44:36.132,00:44:39.469,YOU DON'T FIND THAT DISGUSTING?
00:44:39.552,00:44:41.720,I THINK YOU WANT ME TO.
00:44:41.804,00:44:48.436,BUT I'VE NEVER CONSIDERED THIS ANY MORE OR LESS THAN A TRANSACTION BETWEEN TWO CONSENTING ADULTS.
00:44:48.520,00:44:52.440,"IF YOU JUST WANT THE GIRL WHO WILL DO YOUR BIDDING FOR YOU, YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT."
00:44:54.900,00:45:01.073,"I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT IT WAS YOU WHO INITIATED OUR AFFAIR, AND IT WAS YOU WHO CAME KNOCKING AT MY DOOR LAST WINTER."
00:45:01.157,00:45:04.118,AND IT WAS ME WHO ASKED THAT WE STOP WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW.
00:45:08.456,00:45:12.793,BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T GIVE ME WHAT I WANTED UNLESS I DID.
00:45:12.877,00:45:15.505,"SO TELL ME, WHY DO YOU NEED THIS?"
00:45:15.588,00:45:17.507,YOU DON'T SEEM TO GET ANY PLEASURE OUT OF IT.
00:45:17.590,00:45:19.425,I KNOW I CERTAINLY DON'T.
00:45:21.093,00:45:23.846,I SEEM TO ALWAYS LEAVE YOU SATISFIED.
00:45:23.929,00:45:26.349,HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT FAKING IT?
00:45:30.019,00:45:31.604,ARE YOU?
00:45:31.688,00:45:34.691,DOESN'T IT SAY A LOT THAT YOU CAN'T TELL?
00:45:44.200,00:45:47.495,WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN I'M UP AGAINST THE WALL?
00:45:48.996,00:45:53.918,A GREAT MAN ONCE SAID THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS ABOUT SEX...
00:45:55.086,00:45:56.713,EXCEPT SEX.
00:45:56.795,00:46:00.091,SEX IS ABOUT POWER.
00:46:01.259,00:46:05.388,"SO YOU NEED A WHORE, WHICH MAKES YOU A PIMP."
00:46:05.471,00:46:09.267,I'M NOT A PIMP. JUST A VERY GENEROUS JOHN.
00:46:13.312,00:46:19.485,"FINE. AS LONG AS WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS IS, I CAN PLAY THE WHORE."
00:46:19.569,00:46:21.153,NOW PAY ME.
00:46:21.237,00:46:24.949,THE BILL WILL PASS. WE HAVE IT BY TWO VOTES.
00:46:25.032,00:46:29.870,"YOU CAN PASS THAT ALONG TO YOUR FRIEND, MISS SKORSKY."
00:46:29.954,00:46:34.166,"IF SHE MUST SAY SUCH THINGS IN ORDER TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, SO BE IT."
00:46:34.250,00:46:37.754,HER LOYALTY COSTS ME NOTHING BUT THE OCCASIONAL CRUMB OF NEWS.
00:46:37.836,00:46:40.381,HER HATEFULNESS TAKES NO TOLL AT ALL.
00:46:40.465,00:46:44.761,YOU DON'T COMPENSATE A WORKING GIRL SO YOU CAN CUDDLE AFTER.
00:46:50.141,00:46:52.059,- NO BUSES LOSING THEIR BRAKES. - FINAL CALL FOR VOTING.
00:46:52.143,00:46:54.353,"OH, PLEASE NOW. WHEN DO YOU HEAD BACK?"
00:46:54.437,00:46:56.939,TOMORROW. WE WANNA DO A PRESS CONFERENCE WHEN ALL THE VOTES ARE IN.
00:46:57.022,00:46:59.317,"- MEMBERS, PLEASE CAST YOUR VOTES NOW. - ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?"
00:47:02.945,00:47:05.906,- YOU SAID YOU'RE DUE IN MARCH? - MARCH 14th.
00:47:05.990,00:47:07.784,IT'S SO EXCITING. HOW'S THE MORNING SICKNESS?
00:47:07.866,00:47:09.243,I THINK I'M OVER THE HUMP.
00:47:09.327,00:47:11.828,I HAVE TO PEE ALL THE TIME. WEIRD CRAVINGS.
00:47:13.581,00:47:15.874,IT WAS GOOD TO BE ON THE ROAD AGAIN. INVIGORATING.
00:47:15.958,00:47:17.876,OUR INTERNALS ARE SHOWING A NICE BUMP IN THE NUMBERS.
00:47:17.960,00:47:19.462,YOU MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE.
00:47:19.545,00:47:21.756,"THE PRESIDENT IS GRATEFUL, AND SO AM I."
00:47:21.838,00:47:23.758,"WELL, IT'S A TEAM EFFORT, RIGHT?"
00:47:23.840,00:47:27.679,EXCUSE ME. I HAVE YET TO SAY HELLO TO YOUR BETTER HALF.
00:47:27.762,00:47:30.014,"- HOW'D IT GO AT STANFORD? - WELL, I THINK."
00:47:30.097,00:47:32.642,"THE DEAN'S A REPUBLICAN, SO THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF SMALL TALK."
00:47:32.725,00:47:35.353,BUT HE SEEMED OPEN TO CONSIDERING IT. WE'LL KNOW MORE NEXT WEEK.
00:47:37.854,00:47:39.898,"OH, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. ANYBODY CAN BOOK A PLANE TICKET."
00:47:39.982,00:47:41.984,THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU COVERED FOR ME.
00:47:42.067,00:47:45.321,"WELL, WE HAVE TO KEEP THE IMPORTANT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE, RIGHT?"
00:47:45.404,00:47:47.615,DON'T THINK THIS BOUGHT YOU ANY FAVORS.
00:47:47.699,00:47:50.493,KINDNESS ISN'T KINDNESS IF YOU EXPECT A REWARD.
00:47:50.576,00:47:52.411,THE MAN OF THE HOUR!
00:47:52.495,00:47:54.622,NOT YET. THE VOTES ARE STILL COMING IN.
00:47:54.706,00:47:56.374,"HEY, HOW'D YOU VOTE? I VOTED YES."
00:47:56.457,00:47:58.668,VOTING. I KNEW I FORGOT SOMETHING.
00:47:58.751,00:48:02.547,WE GOT THIS. THERE'S SOME SPARKLING GRAPE JUICE THERE TO CELEBRATE.
00:48:05.842,00:48:07.176,LOOKING GOOD.
00:48:09.595,00:48:11.263,"COME ON, EVERYONE. LET'S GO."
00:48:17.186,00:48:18.895,THIS IS AN EASY WIN FOR US.
00:48:18.979,00:48:20.981,15 SECONDS.
00:48:24.861,00:48:26.738,COME ON.
00:48:28.989,00:48:31.116,"MEMBERS, PLEASE CAST YOUR VOTES NOW."
00:48:34.537,00:48:35.996,VOTING IS CLOSED.
00:48:38.332,00:48:40.292,- DOUG. - I THOUGHT WE HAD IT.
00:48:42.961,00:48:46.298,IT'S SUCH A SHAME. ALL OF THAT HARD WORK.
00:48:47.675,00:48:49.510,I WANNA KNOW WHO LIED.
00:00:11.010,00:00:12.930,IS SO I CAN GET ACCURATE INFORMATION FROM YOU.
00:00:13.012,00:00:14.849,I ALWAYS SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE CLOSE.
00:00:17.100,00:00:19.687,SAY THE LEADERSHIP WAS CONFIDENT THE BILL WOULD PASS?
00:00:19.770,00:00:22.648,- DO YOU KNOW JANINE SKORSKY? - SHE USED TO BE THE HERALD'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT.
00:00:22.731,00:00:24.232,I REMEMBER JANINE.
00:00:26.025,00:00:27.945,REPORTING A VERIFIED VOTE COUNT.
00:00:28.028,00:00:30.030,"ONCE THE MEDIA GOT AHOLD OF THAT, IT WENT EVERYWHERE."
00:00:30.113,00:00:32.407,I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE GOT THAT NUMBER. MAYBE SHE MADE IT UP.
00:00:32.491,00:00:34.409,IT DOESN'T MATTER IF SHE MADE IT UP.
00:00:34.493,00:00:36.745,THE DEMOCRATS SEEM DIVIDED. THE LEADERSHIP LOOKS INCOMPETENT.
00:00:36.829,00:00:40.749,"BUT COMPARED THE THE BUDGET AND OUR EDUCATION ACT, WHY, THIS WAS A MINOR BILL, SIR."
00:00:40.833,00:00:44.545,"THAT HAPPENED TO BE IN THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT, WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANTED."
00:00:44.628,00:00:46.045,I GOT THE COUNT WRONG.
00:00:46.129,00:00:48.924,"IT RARELY HAPPENS, BUT IT HAPPENS."
00:00:49.008,00:00:52.678,WHAT WORRIES ME IS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE'S INFLUENCE ISN'T TRANSLATING INTO SUPPORT ON THE HILL.
00:00:52.761,00:00:54.930,LINDA'S INVOLVEMENT HAD NO EFFECT?
00:00:57.516,00:01:00.019,"DID YOU SENSE ANY PUSH-BACK, ANY FALLOUT FROM THE EDUCATION BATTLE?"
00:01:00.101,00:01:02.062,"SIR, THE TRUTH IS I WASN'T THERE."
00:01:02.145,00:01:06.817,I HAD TO MAKE A TRIP TO CALIFORNIA TO MEET THE PROVOST OF STANFORD FOR MY SON.
00:01:06.901,00:01:08.276,I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT LAST WEEK.
00:01:08.360,00:01:12.531,"IT WAS MY DECISION, SIR. I MADE A JUDGMENT CALL THAT WE COULD PASS THE BILL WITHOUT HER HELP."
00:01:12.614,00:01:18.078,"BUT, LOOK, TIGHT VOTES LIKE THIS, YOU CAN ANALYZE THEM TO DEATH, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE CAME UP SHORT."
00:01:18.161,00:01:20.915,"THAT'S MY FAULT, NO ONE ELSE'S. CERTAINLY NOT LINDA'S."
00:01:20.998,00:01:24.292,I SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE. THE MEETING DIDN'T EVEN WORK.
00:01:24.376,00:01:26.294,I THOUGHT YOU SAID THEY WERE RECONSIDERING.
00:01:26.378,00:01:27.880,NO. I GOT AN E-MAIL THIS MORNING.
00:01:27.963,00:01:30.340,THEY DECIDED NOT TO OVERTURN THE ADMISSIONS DECISION.
00:01:30.424,00:01:31.967,"OH, CHRIST. I'M SORRY, LINDA."
00:01:33.510,00:01:35.930,BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR COVERING FOR ME IN THERE.
00:01:38.974,00:01:43.395,THERE MAY BE A WAY TO TURN LINDA'S BAD LUCK INTO MY GOOD FORTUNE.
00:01:43.478,00:01:49.109,BUT FIRST I MUST DEAL WITH TREASON WITHIN THE RANKS-- THE TWO RENEGADES WHO VOTED AGAINST THE BILL.
00:01:49.192,00:01:54.155,"I HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR BETRAYAL, WHICH THEY WILL SOON INDELIBLY LEARN."
00:03:37.384,00:03:39.594,I KNOW WHY YOU LOST THE VOTE.
00:03:41.096,00:03:43.807,SOMEBODY GOT TO VANDERBURGH AND ABRAMS.
00:03:43.891,00:03:46.018,REMY DANTON.
00:03:48.311,00:03:50.605,I'VE GOT CONTACTS ON BOTH THEIR STAFFS.
00:03:50.689,00:03:52.900,THERE WAS A MEETING BETWEEN THE THREE OF THEM.
00:03:54.902,00:03:58.155,"- SHE TOLD THEM TO VOTE NO. - NO, NOT TRUE."
00:03:58.238,00:04:02.076,SOURCES ON TWO DIFFERENT STAFFS SAYING THE EXACT SAME THING?
00:04:02.159,00:04:03.535,THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
00:04:08.790,00:04:12.335,"THIS IS A JUICY STORY, FRANCIS."
00:04:12.419,00:04:14.088,CARLY WILL LOVE IT.
00:04:14.171,00:04:16.631,THE MAJORITY WHIP'S WIFE STABS HIM IN THE BACK.
00:04:16.715,00:04:18.008,"BE CAREFUL, ZOE."
00:04:18.092,00:04:21.636,I'M FEEDING YOU. NOW YOU HAVE TO FEED ME.
00:04:21.720,00:04:24.223,SO GIVE ME SOMETHING BETTER.
00:04:29.728,00:04:32.480,DID SHE OR DIDN'T SHE?
00:04:32.564,00:04:45.244,"TELL ME NOW, OR SO HELP ME GOD, I WILL MAKE IT MY MISSION IN LIFE TO NOT ONLY DESTROY YOUR CAREERS, BUT TO OBLITERATE ALL HOPE AND HAPPINESS THAT YOU MANAGE TO CLING TO."
00:04:45.326,00:04:47.495,- SHE SAID IT WOULD BE OKAY-- - TO BACKSTAB ME?
00:04:47.579,00:04:49.330,TO DO WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.
00:04:51.499,00:04:54.795,SHE SAID IT WOULDN'T BE THE END OF THE WORLD IF THE BILL FAILED.
00:04:54.878,00:04:57.005,THOSE WERE HER EXACT WORDS.
00:05:00.050,00:05:03.428,YOU DISCUSS THIS WITH NO ONE. IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?
00:05:07.474,00:05:10.185,DO YOU BLAME YOURSELF FOR NOT BEING IN WASHINGTON TO SECURE THE VOTES?
00:05:10.269,00:05:12.395,A BILL THIS SIZE IS A TEAM EFFORT. THERE ARE A LOT OF SPONSORS.
00:05:12.479,00:05:14.815,- BUT YOU WERE THE CHIEF SPONSOR AND THE BILL MANAGER. - THAT'S TRUE.
00:05:14.898,00:05:17.151,SO SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON?
00:05:17.234,00:05:19.778,I'M RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR. I HAVE A COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE OF MY STATE.
00:05:19.861,00:05:27.452,"ARE YOU AWARE THAT THE SWOFFORD CAMPAIGN IS PUTTING OUT A NEW COMMERCIAL TODAY THAT SAYS, QUOTE, IF PETER RUSSO CAN'T FOLLOW THROUGH IN CONGRESS, CAN HE FOLLOW THROUGH WITH SOBRIETY?"
00:05:27.535,00:05:28.912,THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:05:28.996,00:05:30.872,"- DO YOU WANT TO COMMENT? - THANKS, GUYS."
00:05:33.500,00:05:36.003,ALL I SAID WAS WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY-- TO VOTE THEIR CONSCIENCE.
00:05:36.086,00:05:38.005,YOU ENCOURAGED THEM TO DEFY ME.
00:05:38.088,00:05:41.633,"I MET WITH THEM. THAT'S WHAT YOU ASKED ME-- NO, THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU DID."
00:05:41.716,00:05:44.803,I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU I NEEDED THEM TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL.
00:05:44.886,00:05:46.972,THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR INTERPRETATION.
00:05:47.055,00:05:49.348,"IT'S A DELIBERATE LIE, SO DON'T TRY TO SUGARCOAT IT, CLAIRE."
00:05:49.432,00:05:52.811,I NEEDED REMY'S HELP. YOU WOULDN'T OFFER ANY.
00:05:52.894,00:05:55.730,"OH, WAIT."
00:05:55.814,00:05:57.899,YOU DID THIS FOR REMY?
00:05:57.983,00:06:01.945,NO. FOR MYSELF. TO GET MY SHIPMENT OUT OF SUDAN. HE PROVIDED ASSISTANCE.
00:06:02.029,00:06:04.281,IN EXCHANGE FOR DEFEATING THE BILL.
00:06:06.908,00:06:12.080,WHICH IS THE SAME GODDAMN THING. DO YOU REALIZE YOU HAVE ENDANGERED EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOWARD?
00:06:12.164,00:06:13.874,"THERE WAS A TIMETABLE HERE, CLAIRE."
00:06:13.957,00:06:16.626,WE NEEDED STRONG MOMENTUM RIGHT UP UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.
00:06:16.710,00:06:19.254,I CAN'T OPERATE BASED ON PLANS YOU HAVEN'T SHARED WITH ME.
00:06:19.338,00:06:21.589,THEN YOU SHOULD'VE ASKED ME FIRST.
00:06:24.843,00:06:26.970,WE MAKE DECISIONS TOGETHER.
00:06:27.054,00:06:29.848,"YEAH, WELL, IT HASN'T FELT LIKE THAT. NOT FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS."
00:06:29.931,00:06:33.143,I DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH I'M STANDING BESIDE YOU.
00:06:38.065,00:06:41.276,"OTHER PEOPLE KNOW, CLAIRE."
00:06:46.405,00:06:48.533,- AND THAT'S SOMETHING YOU DO NOT RECOVER FROM. - WHO?
00:06:48.616,00:06:50.451,- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT FOLLOWS YOU FOR LIFE. - WHO KNOWS?
00:06:51.995,00:06:53.330,ZOE.
00:06:55.290,00:06:58.417,I THOUGHT YOU SAID SHE COULD BE TRUSTED.
00:07:02.130,00:07:04.465,SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM IF YOU HADN'T LIED.
00:07:04.549,00:07:06.676,"NO, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM IF YOU HADN'T DROPPED YOUR PANTS."
00:07:06.760,00:07:11.932,"AND YOU COME IN HERE, TO MY OFFICE, AND BERATE ME WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S EXPOSED US?"
00:07:12.015,00:07:13.600,DON'T YOU TRY TO TURN THIS AROUND ON ME.
00:07:16.519,00:07:18.397,I HAVE TURNED DOWN DONATIONS FOR US.
00:07:18.521,00:07:20.107,I DRAFTED PETER'S BILL FOR US.
00:07:20.190,00:07:23.526,I DIVERTED TIME AND ENERGY AWAY FROM MY GOALS FOR US.
00:07:23.610,00:07:27.530,"OKAY, I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO SAY THIS, BUT MAYBE YOU NEED TO HEAR IT."
00:07:27.614,00:07:36.790,"C.W.I. IS IMPORTANT, YES, BUT IT DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH."
00:07:36.873,00:07:38.499,YOU MUST SEE THAT!
00:07:41.586,00:07:45.173,I'M JUST BEING HONEST.
00:07:45.257,00:07:48.843,THEN BE HONEST ABOUT HOW YOU'VE BEEN USING ME JUST LIKE YOU USE EVERYBODY ELSE.
00:07:48.927,00:07:51.305,THAT WAS NEVER PART OF THE BARGAIN.
00:07:59.187,00:08:01.022,IS IT THE HOT FLASHES?
00:08:11.450,00:08:13.285,GET OUT.
00:08:20.125,00:08:22.127,I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT THE HOUSE.
00:08:32.679,00:08:34.639,I'M ON MY WAY TO THE OFFICE.
00:08:34.722,00:08:37.267,"- LET ME CALL YOU WHEN I GET THERE. - NO, NO. WE NEED TO TALK NOW."
00:08:37.351,00:08:39.478,"I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET, PETER, BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING."
00:08:39.560,00:08:41.562,"I AM MORE THAN UPSET, FRANK."
00:08:41.646,00:08:44.774,CHANGE YOUR TONE. I'M IN NO MOOD.
00:08:47.027,00:08:50.822,"YOU HANG UP ON ME NOW, YOU'RE NOT GONNA APPRECIATE WHO I CALL NEXT."
00:08:50.905,00:08:53.616,- EXCUSE ME? - I PROMISED MY PEOPLE JOBS.
00:08:53.700,00:08:56.453,YOU PROMISED ME YOU COULD GET THIS BILL PASSED.
00:08:56.536,00:08:59.122,YOU FAILED ON YOUR PROMISE. I'M NOT GONNA FAIL ON MINE.
00:08:59.206,00:09:02.250,"SO HOWEVER YOU NEED TO FIX IT, YOU FIGURE IT OUT."
00:09:12.969,00:09:15.596,"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU ANYMORE, FRANK."
00:09:15.680,00:09:18.350,- THEN YOU'RE MISGUIDED. - MY PAST IS OUT IN THE OPEN.
00:09:18.433,00:09:20.268,YOU DON'T HOLD THAT OVER MY HEAD ANYMORE.
00:09:20.352,00:09:21.895,"THEY DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING, PETER."
00:09:21.978,00:09:25.148,"YOU DESTROY ME, YOU DESTROY YOURSELF."
00:09:29.819,00:09:33.031,- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? - WE HAVE TO ACCELERATE THINGS.
00:09:33.114,00:09:36.659,ISN'T IT TOO EARLY? IT'S ALMOST TWO FULL MONTHS INTO THE ELECTION.
00:09:36.743,00:09:39.329,- THAT GIVES THE WHITE HOUSE TOO MUCH TIME TO VET SOMEBODY. - PETER'S CROSSED THE LINE.
00:09:39.413,00:09:41.706,"WE BUILT UP HIS CONFIDENCE, AND NOW WE'RE LOSING CONTROL OF HIM."
00:09:41.789,00:09:43.500,MAYBE HE WAS JUST BLOWING OFF STEAM.
00:09:43.583,00:09:45.752,NO. HE'S DETERMINED. WE HAVE TO ACT NOW.
00:09:45.835,00:09:47.504,YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED ON YOUR END?
00:09:49.172,00:09:50.673,SOME SORT OF SOCIAL SETTING'S PREFERABLE.
00:09:50.757,00:09:52.884,- ANYTHING ELSE? - I'LL NEED CASH.
00:09:52.967,00:09:54.553,ABOUT THREE GRAND.
00:09:54.635,00:09:56.596,IT'LL BE IN YOUR TOP DRAWER BY TOMORROW MORNING.
00:09:56.679,00:09:58.348,SIR...
00:09:59.891,00:10:02.018,"ONCE WE DO THIS, WE'RE COMMITTED."
00:10:02.102,00:10:04.812,- UNDERSTOOD. - I CAN'T PREDICT HOW HE'S GONNA REACT.
00:10:04.896,00:10:06.565,"WELL, I WON'T BE BLACKMAILED."
00:10:18.701,00:10:20.620,HELLO?
00:10:25.833,00:10:28.002,YEAH. WHO IS IT?
00:10:28.086,00:10:30.464,CLAIRE UNDERWOOD.
00:10:34.301,00:10:36.136,ZOE?
00:10:41.516,00:10:43.602,I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BUZZING.
00:10:43.684,00:11:03.163,"SOMEBODY WAS COMING IN THE BUILDING WHEN I WAS DOWNSTAIRS, THIS IS NICE-- FIRE ESCAPE."
00:11:08.835,00:11:10.753,"HEY, COULD YOU PLEASE NOT GO THROUGH MY THINGS?"
00:11:10.837,00:11:12.380,"OH, I'M SORRY. AM I INTRUDING?"
00:11:14.882,00:11:18.803,"WELL, THAT MAKES IT A TWO-WAY STREET, I SUPPOSE."
00:11:21.598,00:11:25.352,"OKAY, IF YOU-- IF YOU CAME HERE TO PUNISH ME..."
00:11:25.435,00:11:27.145,FINE. I GET IT.
00:11:32.484,00:11:37.238,"SUCH A SHAME, HOW NAIVE YOU ARE."
00:11:39.115,00:11:41.784,- I'M NOT NAIVE. - NO?
00:11:43.702,00:11:46.164,"I'VE KNOWN EVERYTHING FROM THE BEGINNING, ZOE."
00:11:46.247,00:11:48.667,MY HUSBAND AND I TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.
00:11:56.299,00:11:58.968,DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME?
00:12:02.972,00:12:05.475,IS THERE A SPIDER I CAN TRAP?
00:12:09.812,00:12:13.525,"I'M NOT HERE TO PUNISH YOU, OR TO TELL YOU TO STOP."
00:12:13.608,00:12:17.278,I JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD OPEN THOSE BIG BRIGHT EYES.
00:12:26.538,00:12:28.623,I THINK I SHOULD TOO.
00:12:35.589,00:12:37.507,MAYBE YOU'RE NOT THAT NAIVE.
00:12:37.591,00:12:40.093,A LESSER WOMAN WOULDN'T HAVE OPENED THE DOOR.
00:13:13.460,00:13:15.587,"UNION STATION, PLEASE."
00:13:28.767,00:13:34.731,"THIS IS CLAIRE. I'M UNAVAILABLE TO ANSWER THE PHONE, BUT IF YOU LEAVE A MESSAGE, I'LL BE SURE AND GET BACK TO YOU SHORTLY."
00:13:54.125,00:13:56.503,YOU DON'T HAVE TO TIPTOE.
00:13:56.586,00:13:58.505,I THOUGHT YOU FELL ASLEEP.
00:13:58.588,00:14:01.800,NO. JUST THINKING ABOUT WORK.
00:14:01.882,00:14:04.678,I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FOR YOU YET. I WILL SOON.
00:14:04.761,00:14:06.638,I KNOW YOU WILL.
00:14:10.475,00:14:12.686,YOU CAN SPEND THE NIGHT IF YOU WANT.
00:14:12.769,00:14:14.688,EARLY MEETINGS.
00:14:14.771,00:14:16.981,WOULDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET HOME AND CHANGE.
00:14:17.064,00:14:19.942,- YOU SEEM DISTRACTED. - I HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND.
00:14:21.986,00:14:25.156,"- WORK, JUST LIKE YOU. - NO CLAIRE?"
00:14:27.367,00:14:29.243,OR MAYBE SHE QUALIFIES AS WORK.
00:14:31.078,00:14:33.206,SHE DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING?
00:14:36.417,00:14:38.169,ABOUT...
00:14:38.252,00:14:40.505,I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T KEEP THINGS FROM EACH OTHER.
00:14:40.588,00:14:43.257,"LOOK, JUST SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY."
00:14:44.551,00:14:47.011,SHE CAME BY HERE A FEW HOURS AGO.
00:14:47.094,00:14:49.597,WE HAD A NICE LITTLE TALK.
00:14:53.934,00:14:56.062,"YOU SHOULD GO HOME, GET SOME REST."
00:15:07.114,00:15:08.949,HEY!
00:15:16.957,00:15:27.218,THIS IS CLAIRE. I'M UNAVAILABLE TO ANSWER-- THE LIGHTS IN THE WHARTONS' HOUSE WILL GO ON IN A FEW MOMENTS.
00:15:27.301,00:15:38.020,"THEY ALWAYS GET UP PRECISELY AT QUARTER TO 7:00, WHICH IS JUST THE TIME THAT CLAIRE WOULD BE GOING FOR HER RUN, IF SHE WERE HERE."
00:15:41.982,00:15:48.364,"REBELLION ON ALL FRONTS-- CLAIRE, ZOE, RUSSO."
00:15:48.448,00:15:50.909,I MUST NOT LOSE MY RESOLVE.
00:15:50.991,00:15:55.246,"I WILL MARCH FORWARD, EVEN IF I HAVE TO DO SO..."

00:16:16.768,00:16:18.686,- IS IT THE FLU OR SOMETHING? - SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
00:16:18.770,00:16:21.355,I JUST CAME OVER TO PICK UP A FEW THINGS FROM HER OFFICE.
00:16:21.439,00:16:23.858,"- I COULD'VE SENT SOMEBODY OVER. - OH, NO. IT'S NO BIG DEAL."
00:16:23.942,00:16:26.152,"IN FACT, I ALSO CAME HERE TO ASK YOU A FAVOR."
00:16:26.235,00:16:28.905,"YOU WENT TO STANFORD, CORRECT?"
00:16:28.988,00:16:31.198,- VALEDICTORIAN? - YEAH.
00:16:31.282,00:16:34.535,- DO YOU KNOW THE PROVOST? - WARREN TYNSDALE.

00:16:37.497,00:16:39.999,SUPPOSEDLY I'M THE POSTER CHILD FOR ALUMNI.
00:16:40.082,00:16:41.835,MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
00:16:44.337,00:16:48.466,"LINDA VASQUEZ, THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF-- HER SON, RUBEN, APPLIED."
00:16:48.549,00:16:53.387,I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO GET ON THE PHONE WITH TYNSDALE AND TELL HIM THAT THEY SHOULD ACCEPT HIM.
00:16:53.471,00:16:56.557,I DON'T KNOW. I-- I'VE NEVER RECOMMENDED ANYONE.
00:16:56.641,00:16:58.935,ALL THE BETTER. IT'LL CARRY MORE WEIGHT.
00:16:59.018,00:17:02.021,CAN I MEET RUBEN FIRST?
00:17:05.191,00:17:10.154,"IN FACT, IT WOULD BE BETTER IF BOTH SHE AND RUBEN BELIEVED HE GOT IN ON MERIT ALONE."
00:17:10.237,00:17:13.324,WILL YOU PLEASE DO THIS FAVOR FOR CLAIRE AND ME?
00:17:17.871,00:17:20.206,THANK YOU.
00:17:23.584,00:17:25.753,MORE CONTRAST.
00:17:25.837,00:17:29.048,WE NEED TO CATCH THE EDGE OF HIS FACE.
00:17:29.131,00:17:31.968,LET'S RE-CROP IT. BRING IT IN A QUARTER OF AN INCH ON THE LEFT.
00:17:33.594,00:17:35.054,WOULD YOU...

00:17:56.617,00:17:59.037,REMY.
00:17:59.119,00:18:01.581,YOU HUNGRY?
00:18:01.664,00:18:03.583,I DON'T EAT PORK.
00:18:03.666,00:18:05.752,WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?
00:18:05.835,00:18:08.379,WHEN WE STARTED LOBBYING FOR THE MEATPACKING INDUSTRY.
00:18:13.801,00:18:15.428,I'M GOOD. I ALREADY ATE LUNCH.
00:18:15.511,00:18:17.430,HALF A RACK COMING UP.
00:18:17.513,00:18:19.306,I DON'T USUALLY DO BUSINESS HERE.
00:18:19.390,00:18:20.975,THIS IS MY LITTLE SECRET.
00:18:21.059,00:18:23.394,I'D LOVE IT IF WE COULD KEEP IT THAT WAY.
00:18:23.477,00:18:26.439,I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME BRINGING CLIENTS BY.
00:18:29.692,00:18:31.861,"YOU SEEM TENSE, REMY."
00:18:31.945,00:18:34.280,I ASSUME YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT THE WATERSHED BILL.
00:18:34.363,00:18:36.282,NOT WITH YOU. YOU WERE JUST DOING YOUR JOB.
00:18:36.365,00:18:38.492,BUT NOW I HAVE TO DO MINE.
00:18:38.576,00:18:41.161,I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A PARTNERSHIP.
00:18:41.245,00:18:44.123,"I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO PARTNERSHIPS, FRANK."
00:18:44.206,00:18:50.463,"IF PETER RUSSO WERE A PRO-NATURAL GAS CANDIDATE, HOW VALUABLE WOULD THAT BE TO SANCORP?"
00:18:50.546,00:18:52.465,THE WATERSHED BILL WAS ANTI-DRILLING.
00:18:52.548,00:18:54.717,"PETER'S PRO-EMPLOYMENT, NOT ANTI-DRILLING."
00:18:54.801,00:18:59.680,"HE JUST WANTS TO BRING EMPLOYMENT TO HIS PEOPLE, AND SANCORP IS BUILDING REFINERIES."
00:18:59.764,00:19:01.724,MOSTLY ON SITE.
00:19:01.808,00:19:06.186,DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD BE OPEN TO CONSIDERING PHILADELPHIA?
00:19:08.439,00:19:11.484,"I CAN TALK WITH THEM, BUT I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES."
00:19:11.567,00:19:13.820,"OH, I DON'T WANT ANY PROMISES. JUST ENGAGE WITH RUSSO."
00:19:13.903,00:19:16.030,"YOU KNOW, GIVE HIM A GLIMMER OF GOOD FORTUNE."
00:19:16.114,00:19:19.450,"AW, FRANK, HERE YOU GO."
00:19:20.618,00:19:22.620,COME ON. SMELL THAT.
00:19:22.703,00:19:26.124,YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO RECONSIDER YOUR STANCE ON PORK?
00:19:47.854,00:19:50.148,YOU CAN AFFORD THAT?
00:19:55.194,00:19:57.571,SO IS THE SECURITY DEPOSIT.
00:19:57.655,00:20:00.282,THAT'S TO BUY SOME FURNITURE.
00:20:07.456,00:20:09.375,I'LL PAY YOU BACK. I PROMISE.
00:20:09.458,00:20:11.794,IT'S NOT NECESSARY.
00:20:16.757,00:20:19.385,BUT I DO NEED YOU TO DO ONE THING FOR ME.
00:20:24.140,00:20:25.975,DO YOU REALLY CARE HOW YOU DELIVER THEM?
00:20:26.059,00:20:30.521,"FIRST, I ADVOCATE FOR MORE REGULATION FOR THE WATERSHED, THEN I COZY UP TO THE DRILLING INTERESTS?"
00:20:30.604,00:20:32.523,"YEAH, BUT NATURAL GAS IS THE FUTURE, PETER."
00:20:32.606,00:20:37.111,"THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT COULD BRING 100,000 JOBS INTO YOUR STATE OVER THE NEXT DECADE."
00:20:37.195,00:20:40.280,I AGREE WITH PETER. IT SEEMS LIKE FLIP-FLOPPING.
00:20:40.364,00:20:44.326,SANCORP'S LOBBYING EFFORTS IS WHY WE LOST THE WATERSHED BILL.
00:20:44.410,00:20:48.372,BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE A VERY POWERFUL ALLY.
00:20:50.875,00:20:52.793,THIS MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE BUSINESS AS USUAL.
00:20:52.877,00:20:54.378,THIS IS POLITICS.
00:20:54.461,00:20:57.798,THERE ARE SEIZED OPPORTUNITIES AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES.
00:20:57.882,00:21:00.342,"SEIZE THIS ONE, PETER."
00:21:02.261,00:21:05.932,SANCORP CAN COMMIT TO BUILDING NEW REFINERIES IN PHILLY?
00:21:06.015,00:21:08.809,SANCORP WILL COMMIT TO DISCUSSING IT WITH YOU.
00:21:08.893,00:21:11.270,"- I NEED MORE THAN THAT. - LOOK, YOU ASKED ME TO FIX A PROBLEM."
00:21:11.353,00:21:14.232,I'VE COME TO YOU IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS WITH A SOLUTION.
00:21:14.314,00:21:16.650,CAN YOU MEET ME HALFWAY?
00:21:17.860,00:21:19.862,WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP?
00:21:19.946,00:21:22.531,ALL RIGHT. YOU REMEMBER REMY DANTON?
00:21:22.615,00:21:25.701,"- OH, COME ON. HE LED THE CHARGE AGAINST THE WATERSHED BILL. - I KNOW. THAT'S NOT THE POINT."
00:21:25.785,00:21:29.789,ONE OF HIS OTHER BIG CLIENTS IS THE McNEALLY CANCER INSTITUTE.
00:21:33.126,00:21:34.668,REMY WILL BE THERE.
00:21:34.752,00:21:37.964,"WE HAVE EVENTS IN HAVERFORD AND GLADWYNE-- YEAH, WELL, THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT."
00:21:38.047,00:21:41.341,YOU ALSO HAVE A RADIO INTERVIEW TOMORROW MORNING WITH A LOCAL PITTSBURGH STATION?
00:21:41.425,00:21:43.385,- YES. - ALL RIGHT.
00:21:43.469,00:21:45.721,MEET WITH REMY TONIGHT.
00:21:45.805,00:21:51.978,"AND IF IT GOES WELL AND IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE, TOMORROW MORNING ON THE RADIO, YOU SUPPORT THEIR DRILLING EFFORTS."
00:21:52.061,00:21:57.399,"AND REMY HAS ASSURED ME IF YOU DO THAT, HE CAN PUSH SANCORP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION."
00:22:02.029,00:22:03.948,CANCEL THE EVENTS TOMORROW.
00:22:04.031,00:22:05.950,"HEAD BACK TO PHILLY, DO SOME DAMAGE CONTROL."
00:22:06.033,00:22:09.703,- I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW AFTERNOON. - PETER-- PLEASE.
00:22:11.497,00:22:13.040,OKAY.
00:22:13.124,00:22:15.084,I'M GONNA GO MAKE SOME CALLS.
00:22:23.176,00:22:27.263,"PETER, HAVE YOU MENTIONED ANYTHING TO HER ABOUT KAPENIAK OR..."
00:22:30.808,00:22:33.019,NO. I HAVEN'T MENTIONED IT TO ANYBODY.
00:22:36.189,00:22:41.319,ALL RIGHT. STAMPER WILL COME BY IN THE MORNING AND BRIEF YOU ON THE TALKING POINTS.
00:22:52.038,00:22:54.623,THE SUN HAD JUST COME UP.
00:22:55.457,00:22:58.627,YOU WERE ASLEEP... RIGHT HERE.
00:23:00.420,00:23:02.256,THE LIGHT WAS PERFECT.
00:23:03.423,00:23:05.718,I HAD NO CHOICE.
00:23:05.801,00:23:10.223,I ALWAYS SLEPT SO WELL IN THIS APARTMENT.
00:23:13.433,00:23:14.977,I DON'T KNOW.
00:23:15.061,00:23:16.937,I HAVEN'T DECIDED.
00:23:18.105,00:23:20.024,YOU HAVE NO LUGGAGE.
00:23:23.443,00:23:25.487,IT SMELLS THE SAME.
00:23:31.451,00:23:33.495,FEELS THE SAME.
00:24:19.333,00:24:21.835,NOT HAVING A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN PHILADELPHIA.
00:24:21.919,00:24:24.630,THERE ARE ADVANTAGES TO CENTRALIZING IN A MAJOR URBAN CENTER.
00:24:32.346,00:24:34.807,- SIGNIFICANTLY. - HOW CAN I HELP WITH THAT?
00:24:34.890,00:24:38.185,STATEWIDE PERMITTED-USE ZONING. NO MORE CONDITIONAL ZONING.
00:24:38.269,00:24:40.229,THE MUNICIPALITIES ARE SLOWING DOWN DEVELOPMENT.
00:24:40.313,00:24:42.022,THAT'S THE STATE LEGISLATURE.
00:24:42.106,00:24:45.859,"YOU COME OUT IN SUPPORT OF PERMITTED USE, AND YOU GET ELECTED GOVERNOR."
00:24:45.943,00:24:48.195,THAT'LL PUT PRESSURE ON THE LEGISLATURE.
00:24:48.279,00:24:50.906,SANCORP IS VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING A POWERFUL FRIEND IN HARRISBURG.
00:24:50.990,00:24:52.699,MY OPPONENT'S PRO-DRILLING.
00:24:52.783,00:24:55.202,YOUR OPPONENT ISN'T ASKING FOR REFINERIES IN PHILADELPHIA.
00:24:56.954,00:24:58.998,WE PREFER FRIENDS WE CAN COUNT ON.

00:26:22.622,00:26:26.752,"MY DATE DITCHED ME. SO IF YOU ABANDON ME NOW, THAT WOULD BE VERY RUDE."

00:30:12.978,00:30:14.313,- REALLY? - YEAH.
00:30:14.396,00:30:17.566,"- WHY DO YOU DO THAT? - WELL, YOU KNOW."

00:30:53.811,00:30:56.188,"OH, FUCK."
00:32:16.935,00:32:18.812,THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE BAILED.
00:32:23.191,00:32:25.026,SIT DOWN.
00:32:32.242,00:32:34.160,VODKA OR WHISKEY?
00:32:36.246,00:32:39.499,"COME ON. YOU CAN BE A GOOD BOY DOWNSTAIRS, NOT UP HERE."
00:32:39.583,00:32:41.501,"SERIOUSLY, I'M GOOD."
00:32:41.585,00:32:43.503,"WHISKEY, I THINK."
00:32:49.593,00:32:52.011,SO WHAT'S YOUR GOOD NEWS?
00:32:52.095,00:32:55.265,I WANNA KNOW WHAT WE'RE CELEBRATING.
00:32:55.348,00:32:58.852,"WHY DID YOUR, UH-- WHY DID YOUR DATE DITCH YOU?"
00:32:58.936,00:33:01.020,"- I ASKED YOU FIRST. - I DID, DOWNSTAIRS."
00:33:03.732,00:33:05.651,HE WORKS ON THE HILL.
00:33:05.734,00:33:07.653,SOME STAFFER OR SOMETHING.
00:33:07.736,00:33:10.280,I DON'T KNOW. I THINK HE'S A GLORIFIED GOFER.
00:33:10.363,00:33:12.031,A FRIEND SET ME UP WITH HIM.
00:33:12.115,00:33:14.785,"SO I SAID HE SHOULD COME TONIGHT, KEEP ME COMPANY."
00:33:14.868,00:33:16.829,BUT ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS SCHMOOZE.
00:33:16.912,00:33:21.374,"SO I BROUGHT HIM INTO THE WOMEN'S BATHROOM, TOLD HIM HE WAS BEING AN ASSHOLE."
00:33:21.458,00:33:24.002,HE TOLD ME I WAS BEING CHILDISH.
00:33:24.085,00:33:26.421,SO I SLAPPED HIM.
00:33:28.381,00:33:31.217,YEAH. BIG RED HAND MARK RIGHT ACROSS HIS FACE.
00:33:31.301,00:33:33.804,I THINK HE WAS EMBARRASSED TO BE SEEN BY THE SCHMOOZERATI.
00:33:33.887,00:33:35.430,SO HE LEFT.
00:33:35.514,00:33:40.185,AND THAT IS THE LAST TIME I GO ON A DATE WITH A GUY WHO WEARS A FLAG PIN TO WORK.
00:33:40.268,00:33:44.105,I'M ONE OF THOSE GUYS WHO WEARS A FLAG PIN TO WORK.
00:33:46.817,00:33:48.694,"THIS ISN'T REALLY A DATE, IS IT?"
00:33:50.069,00:33:52.405,I REALLY SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
00:33:52.489,00:33:54.616,THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUN.
00:33:57.243,00:34:00.121,TELL ME YOUR GOOD NEWS. I WANNA KNOW WHAT WE'RE TOASTING TO.
00:34:02.541,00:34:04.376,LET'S TOAST TO YOU.

00:34:54.342,00:34:58.931,"WELL, JUST ON YOUR COUCH FOR A NIGHT OR TWO."
00:34:59.014,00:35:00.933,"UH, WHY?"
00:35:01.016,00:35:03.309,I CAN'T BE IN MY APARTMENT.
00:35:03.393,00:35:06.145,- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN? - NO. I...

00:35:32.923,00:35:35.008,"JUST TELL ME, IS IT GOING WELL?"
00:35:35.092,00:35:37.010,HASN'T BEEN ANY UPDATES.
00:35:37.094,00:35:39.012,"BUT IF IT DOES GO WELL, YOU'LL BE READY?"
00:35:39.096,00:35:41.807,I'M READY. I'VE BEEN READY. I'M READY.
00:35:41.890,00:35:44.059,"- ANYTHING ELSE? - WE NEVER PLAYED CHESS BEFORE, HAVE WE?"

00:38:26.763,00:38:28.140,NOT ADORABLE.
00:38:37.523,00:38:39.567,"SO, WHY DO YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF YOUR APARTMENT?"
00:38:41.987,00:38:45.115,IT JUST FELT SMALL.

00:49:36.014,00:49:37.850,PETER!
00:49:40.185,00:49:42.438,PETER?
00:49:42.521,00:49:43.980,HEY!
00:01:44.563,00:01:46.481,THIS IS RUSSO. PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE.
00:01:46.565,00:01:48.108,HE'S NOT ANSWERING MY CALLS.
00:01:48.191,00:01:50.402,"IT'S OVER, AND HE MUST KNOW IT."
00:01:53.488,00:01:59.578,THE REPUBLICANS WILL PLAY THAT INTERVIEW ON EVERY RADIO AND TELEVISION STATION FROM NOW UNTIL NOVEMBER 5th.
00:01:59.661,00:02:02.998,"I SYMPATHIZE WITH THE KID, BUT THIS WAS MY CONCERN FROM THE BEGINNING."
00:02:03.082,00:02:05.292,"AND I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU, SIR."
00:02:05.375,00:02:07.962,I THOUGHT HE COULD HANDLE THE PRESSURE.
00:02:08.045,00:02:09.964,OKAY. SO HE WITHDRAWS.
00:02:10.047,00:02:11.590,WE NEED TO REPLACE HIM.
00:02:11.673,00:02:13.842,YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS?
00:02:13.926,00:02:17.262,WITH LESS THAN TWO MONTHS TO GO?
00:02:20.140,00:02:29.524,"I COULD'VE COME UP WITH SOME GOOD OPTIONS, BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO'S GOT THE NAME RECOGNITION AND DONOR BASE TO START A CAMPAIGN FROM SCRATCH JUST SEVEN WEEKS OUT."
00:02:29.608,00:02:31.568,LET ME THINK.
00:02:33.320,00:02:36.239,EVERYTHING HINGES ON THE NEXT FEW MINUTES.
00:02:36.323,00:02:40.243,"ALL MY MONTHS OF PLANNING, EVERY MOVE I'VE MADE."
00:02:42.955,00:02:45.874,- THERE IS ONE PERSON. - WHO?
00:02:47.876,00:02:49.837,"YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT."
00:02:51.922,00:02:56.010,"IF YOU RAN TO RECLAIM YOUR SEAT, I THINK YOU'D WIN BY A LANDSLIDE."
00:02:56.093,00:02:57.636,RESIGN THE VICE PRESIDENCY.
00:02:57.719,00:02:59.763,ONLY IF YOU WIN.
00:02:59.847,00:03:01.765,WALKER NEEDS ME FOR 2016.
00:03:03.475,00:03:06.603,ARE YOU ENTIRELY CERTAIN HE'S GONNA KEEP YOU ON THE TICKET?
00:03:06.687,00:03:12.609,"I MEAN, IT'S NO SECRET THE TWO OF YOU DON'T EXACTLY GET ALONG."
00:03:12.693,00:03:14.235,WHAT HAS HE SAID?
00:03:16.697,00:03:19.950,"OH, YOU'RE PUTTING ME IN A VERY AWKWARD POSITION, MR. VICE PRESIDENT."
00:03:20.034,00:03:22.619,HAS HE BEEN BAD-MOUTHING ME?
00:03:22.703,00:03:26.957,"WELL, THE EXACT PHRASE HE USED WAS PAIN IN THE ASS."
00:03:32.587,00:03:33.922,THAT FUCKER.
00:03:34.006,00:03:38.593,"HE'S GOT NO IDEA HOW TO LEAD, NO SENSE OF RESPECT."
00:03:38.677,00:03:40.762,"- OH, IS THIS HIS IDEA? - NO."
00:03:40.846,00:03:44.892,"- HIS WAY OF GETTING RID OF ME? - NO. IT STRUCK ME YESTERDAY, AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH SUGGESTING."
00:03:44.975,00:03:46.601,"BUT, NO, I HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THIS WITH ANYONE."
00:03:46.685,00:03:48.562,AND YOU SHOULDN'T.
00:03:48.645,00:03:51.982,PEOPLE DON'T LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE TO BECOME A GOVERNOR.
00:03:54.317,00:03:56.987,"MAY I ASK YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION, SIR?"
00:03:57.071,00:03:59.489,DO YOU WANT TO BE THE VICE PRESIDENT?
00:03:59.573,00:04:10.250,"PETER SAID THAT WHEN YOU WERE OUT ON THAT CAMPAIGN TRAIL, YOU HAD SO MUCH ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY THAT HE THOUGHT YOU MAYBE MISSED BEING THE GOVERNOR."
00:04:12.627,00:04:14.379,I DO MISS IT.
00:04:14.462,00:04:16.798,THEN WHY NOT GO BACK?
00:04:16.882,00:04:23.180,YOU COULD BE THE HERO OF THIS ELECTION AND SECURE PENNSYLVANIA FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN 2016.
00:04:27.142,00:04:29.061,EVEN IF HE HATES MY GUTS.
00:04:29.144,00:04:34.024,"IT WOULD MAKE HIM LOOK WEAK, LIKE HE'S LOST CONTROL OF THE ADMINISTRATION."
00:04:34.108,00:04:36.151,NOT IF IT WAS A MUTUAL DECISION.
00:04:37.360,00:04:39.613,"LOOK, LET ME TALK TO GARRETT."
00:04:39.696,00:04:41.740,I WON'T MENTION THAT WE'VE SPOKEN.
00:04:44.201,00:04:47.079,I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO HARM IN FINDING OUT WHAT HE THINKS.
00:04:57.798,00:04:59.716,- D.J. - WHO IS CARTER?
00:05:17.109,00:05:21.863,I ALMOST CALLED THE POLICE TO HAVE THEM BREAK IN AND MAKE SURE YOU HADN'T HURT YOURSELF.
00:05:21.947,00:05:25.659,I'M NOT GONNA EVEN ASK YOU WHAT HAPPENED. IT DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT NOW.
00:05:39.464,00:05:42.050,"OH, COME ON. HEY, I'M WATCHING THAT."
00:05:45.637,00:05:52.019,WHAT MATTERS IS THE 50 REPORTERS IN FRONT OF YOUR BUILDING AND THE 150 CAMPAIGN STAFFERS WHO DON'T KNOW IF THEY STILL HAVE A JOB.
00:05:52.102,00:05:53.979,IT'S OVER.
00:05:55.438,00:05:58.025,I KNOW.
00:05:58.108,00:06:00.359,"SO, TELL THEM TO GO AWAY."
00:06:13.915,00:06:17.085,"WHAT, ARE YOU JUST GONNA HOLE YOURSELF UP IN HERE AND HOPE IT ALL GOES AWAY?"
00:06:18.795,00:06:21.256,"WELL, I WON'T LET YOU."
00:06:21.340,00:06:24.801,"HEY, PUT THAT DOWN. HEY."
00:06:24.885,00:06:27.221,"- HEY, PUT THAT DOWN! - PETER..."
00:06:45.864,00:06:47.741,CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED TO DO THAT.
00:06:50.369,00:06:52.913,I'LL BE AT THE HEADQUARTERS IN PHILLY.
00:06:59.794,00:07:01.796,TOO MUCH FOR YOU.
00:07:03.715,00:07:06.509,I THINK THAT'S WHY I ENDED IT.
00:07:06.593,00:07:08.511,AND YOU HAVE NO ROOM FOR FEAR?
00:07:08.595,00:07:11.514,NO. BEING AFRAID DOESN'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.
00:07:11.598,00:07:19.314,"THAT'S NOT TRUE. WHEN I'M OVERSEAS, RATIONAL FEAR-- DISEASE OR VIOLENCE-- THAT SORT OF FEAR KEEPS YOU ALIVE."
00:07:22.192,00:07:27.655,I FIND MYSELF AFRAID OF THINGS THAT I CAN'T NAME OR POINT TO.
00:07:27.739,00:07:31.410,"IT'S LIKE, UH, HOW LITTLE AM I SEEING?"
00:07:31.492,00:07:34.996,OR HAVE I WASTED THIS DAY OR THIS MOMENT?
00:07:35.080,00:07:39.709,"YEAH, I THINK THAT SOMETIMES-- WHETHER MY LIFE WILL ADD UP."
00:07:44.298,00:07:46.633,IF HE HEARD ME TALKING LIKE THIS.
00:07:52.931,00:07:54.766,"NO, HE DOESN'T."
00:08:04.776,00:08:07.695,"IF HE'S LOOKING FOR YOU, THAT'S WHERE YOU ARE."
00:08:07.779,00:08:10.407,OVER THERE.
00:08:10.490,00:08:12.451,BEFORE YOU MET FRANK.
00:08:12.533,00:08:14.453,ALONE.
00:08:14.535,00:08:16.455,CURIOUS.
00:08:16.537,00:08:18.957,ABSORBING EVERYTHING.
00:08:24.545,00:08:26.506,DID HE EVER KNOW THAT SIDE OF YOU?
00:08:28.967,00:08:32.179,HE WASN'T INTERESTED IN THAT GIRL.
00:08:32.262,00:08:34.181,AND NEITHER WAS I.
00:08:38.435,00:08:40.395,YOU WANTED TO BE SEEN.
00:08:40.479,00:08:42.814,NOT JUST SEEN.
00:08:42.897,00:08:45.692,I WANTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT.
00:08:53.200,00:08:55.202,THERE'S NO HISTORICAL PRECEDENT.
00:08:55.285,00:08:57.662,"AARON BURR RAN FOR GOVERNOR, CALHOUN FOR THE SENATE."
00:08:57.745,00:09:01.541,"200 YEARS AGO. ONE SHOT A MAN IN A DUEL, THE OTHER BELIEVED IN SLAVERY."
00:09:01.624,00:09:03.751,"IS THAT REALLY THE SORT OF COMPANY WE WANNA SHARE, FRANK?"
00:09:10.591,00:09:13.845,PREVENTING ALL OF THAT MAY REQUIRE UNCONVENTIONAL MEASURES.
00:09:15.805,00:09:18.433,OR WORSE-- THAT HE'S ABANDONING THE ADMINISTRATION.
00:09:19.934,00:09:21.853,YOU MAKE A JOINT STATEMENT.
00:09:21.936,00:09:24.231,YOU SAY HE WON'T RESIGN UNLESS HE WINS.
00:09:27.942,00:09:30.945,NO ONE COULD ACCUSE EITHER OF YOU OF DISLOYALTY TO THE OTHER.
00:09:31.029,00:09:33.781,- DID JIM COME TO YOU WITH THIS? - NO. IT'S ENTIRELY MY IDEA.
00:09:33.865,00:09:36.951,I WOULDN'T DREAM OF SPEAKING TO THE VICE PRESIDENT WITHOUT PASSING IT BY YOU FIRST.
00:09:37.035,00:09:41.206,"I THINK HE'D TAKE IT AS AN AFFRONT, LIKE I'M TRYING TO GET RID OF HIM."
00:09:41.289,00:09:44.543,"HONESTLY, SIR, I THINK HE MIGHT BE MORE INTERESTED THAN YOU IMAGINE."
00:09:44.625,00:09:54.261,"- WHY IS THAT? - WELL, I HESITATE TO BRING THIS UP, BUT WHEN HE WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR RUSSO, HE SPOKE QUITE FREELY ABOUT YOU, SIR."
00:09:56.971,00:10:00.183,MM-HMM. TELL ME.
00:10:00.267,00:10:10.068,"OF COURSE, I'M GETTING THIS SECONDHAND FROM PETER, BUT THE GIST OF IT IS THAT-- THAT YOU LACK ENTIRELY IN LEADERSHIP, AND THAT YOU HAVE NO SENSE OF RESPECT."
00:10:10.151,00:10:12.112,AND HE WANTS MORE RESPONSIBILITY.
00:10:17.075,00:10:23.540,"WELL, THAT IS ENTIRELY MY POINT. NOW, LOOK, I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR BACKING RUSSO, BUT THERE COULD BE A SILVER LINING IN ALL THIS."
00:10:31.506,00:10:32.924,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:10:34.384,00:10:38.305,"I THINK IT IS A VERY BIG DECISION, AND WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE IT IMPULSIVELY."
00:10:38.388,00:10:40.765,I AGREE. I'D LIKE TO PUT SOME MORE THOUGHT INTO IT.
00:10:40.848,00:10:45.061,"WELL, THAT IS VERY PRUDENT, SIR. JUST BEAR IN MIND, SEVEN WEEKS OUT, THAT EVERY DAY COUNTS."
00:10:58.408,00:11:00.743,"- HI, SIR. - HOW MUCH IS IT?"
00:11:00.827,00:11:03.079,"OH, I GOT YOUR RECEIPT RIGHT HERE."
00:11:08.502,00:11:11.505,"NO, NO, NO. IT WAS-- IT WAS JUST $40."
00:11:11.588,00:11:14.424,"YEAH. DON'T TELL ANYONE, ALL RIGHT?"
00:11:16.176,00:11:18.303,NO. I-- I NEVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT OUR TENANTS.
00:11:20.180,00:11:22.098,- THE PRESS STILL OUTSIDE? - YEAH.
00:11:22.182,00:11:24.184,"I TOLD THEM YOU WEREN'T HERE, LIKE YOU SAID."
00:11:24.267,00:11:26.894,"MOST OF THEM LEFT. THERE'S STILL, YOU KNOW, A FEW, THOUGH."
00:11:26.978,00:11:29.856,"IF I WANTED TO LEAVE, IS THERE A PLACE I COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING SEEN?"
00:11:29.939,00:11:32.359,YEAH. THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR DOWN TO THE GARAGE.
00:11:32.442,00:11:36.029,- I COULD CALL YOU A CAB OR-- - ALL RIGHT. THANKS. I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
00:11:36.112,00:11:43.786,"MR. RUSSO, UH-- SIR, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT, UH, MY UNCLE-- HE FELL OFF THE WAGON A FEW TIMES."
00:11:43.870,00:11:46.540,"WHEN HE DID, THE BEST THING FOR HIM WAS JUST NOT TO BE ALONE."
00:11:46.623,00:11:53.254,"I'LL GIVE YOU THIS MONEY BACK, I'LL TAKE THAT BAG OFF YOUR HANDS, COME IN HERE, KEEP YOU COMPANY-- I APPRECIATE IT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF I CHANGE MY MIND."
00:13:45.742,00:13:47.577,SIT DOWN.
00:13:50.079,00:13:51.914,WHERE'S CLAIRE?
00:13:51.998,00:13:54.167,NOT HERE.
00:13:54.250,00:13:57.545,"SO WHAT IS THIS, TYING UP LOOSE ENDS?"
00:14:00.632,00:14:03.635,PEOPLE LIKE YOU CAN'T BE NEATLY TIED UP.
00:14:03.718,00:14:05.386,BUT I THOUGHT PERHAPS WE COULD START...
00:15:16.791,00:15:20.044,THIS IS THE DRESS SHE WORE TO THE GALA.
00:15:20.127,00:15:21.880,I BELIEVE SO.
00:15:21.962,00:15:23.715,IT IS.
00:15:23.798,00:15:25.633,I RECOGNIZE IT.
00:15:32.014,00:15:33.850,GO BACK INTO THE BEDROOM.
00:15:54.454,00:15:57.916,I'M AMAZED HOW WELL YOU GOT HER IN FOCUS.
00:16:05.214,00:16:07.049,WHAT SHOULD WE CALL HER?
00:16:08.217,00:16:10.261,WHY DOES SHE NEED A NAME?
00:16:10.344,00:16:13.222,I NEVER PHOTOGRAPH ANYONE WITHOUT KNOWING THEIR NAME.
00:16:13.306,00:16:15.850,YOU DIDN'T TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPH. I DID.
00:16:17.602,00:16:20.647,I THINK WE SHOULD CALL HER CLAIRE.
00:16:25.693,00:16:27.946,NOT EVEN A YOUNGER VERSION. WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?
00:16:30.782,00:16:33.701,"HEY, WE SHOULD MOUNT IT. YOU CAN HANG HER IN YOUR HOUSE."
00:16:33.785,00:16:35.829,WOULD FRANCIS OBJECT?
00:16:38.623,00:16:41.542,CAN WE PLEASE NOT DISCUSS FRANCIS?
00:16:41.626,00:16:43.544,YOU BROUGHT HIM UP IN THE PARK.
00:16:45.755,00:16:48.215,SO WE HAVE TO PRETEND HE DOESN'T EXIST?
00:16:56.975,00:17:00.520,I THOUGHT WE COULD TALK ABOUT ANYTHING.
00:17:00.603,00:17:03.982,HE IS A PRESENCE HERE. YOU MUST ADMIT THAT.
00:17:04.064,00:17:08.862,"WHEN YOU WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR YESTERDAY, HE WALKED RIGHT IN WITH YOU."
00:17:10.237,00:17:12.490,"IT'S JUST ME, NOBODY ELSE."
00:17:12.573,00:17:16.076,"YOU KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT, IT MIGHT COME TRUE."
00:17:21.165,00:17:24.585,HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'D FEEL IF SHE KNEW I WAS WEARING THIS?
00:17:28.548,00:17:31.425,YOU DON'T THINK SHE'D BE UPSET?
00:17:31.509,00:17:34.929,SHE'D PROBABLY SAY YOU LOOK VERY BEAUTIFUL IN IT.
00:17:36.764,00:17:38.975,IT'S LIKE STEEL.
00:17:41.185,00:17:43.021,YOU SHOULD PUT IT BACK.
00:17:47.274,00:17:49.235,I THINK I'LL KEEP IT.
00:17:49.318,00:17:52.530,"I'LL BUY YOU ONE OF YOUR OWN, IF YOU'D LIKE."
00:17:52.613,00:17:55.157,NO. I WANT THIS ONE.
00:17:55.241,00:17:57.911,SHE CAME INTO MY BEDROOM.
00:17:57.994,00:18:00.287,SHE SHOULD KNOW I CAME INTO HERS.
00:18:05.543,00:18:08.295,IS YOUR BED ALWAYS SO PERFECTLY MADE?
00:18:08.379,00:18:10.715,IT'S A HABIT I FORMED AT MILITARY SCHOOL.
00:18:10.798,00:18:14.886,WHAT SIDE OF THE BED DOES SHE SLEEP ON?
00:18:16.470,00:18:18.305,THAT SIDE.
00:18:40.703,00:18:42.538,FITS HER BETTER ANYWAY.
00:19:27.583,00:19:29.418,"LISTEN, ZOE..."
00:19:30.586,00:19:38.886,"WHATEVER JUST HAPPENED UPSTAIRS, WHATEVER THESE PAST SIX MONTHS HAVE BEEN, CAN WE AGREE THAT IT IS TIME TO SIMPLIFY?"
00:19:38.970,00:19:40.930,WHAT DOES SIMPLE LOOK LIKE?
00:19:41.014,00:19:48.104,"WE MAINTAIN OUR PROFESSIONAL ARRANGEMENT, AS YOU SUGGESTED, WHICH I WILL HONOR."
00:19:48.187,00:19:50.023,AND YOU STILL TRUST ME?
00:19:52.441,00:19:54.735,WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?
00:20:05.163,00:20:07.748,I'M GLAD I DIDN'T HAVE TO.
00:20:09.583,00:20:13.379,"YES, WE'LL AGREE TO SIMPLIFY."
00:20:14.547,00:20:16.090,GOOD.
00:20:37.153,00:20:40.239,"SORRY I'M A FEW MINUTES LATE, FRANK."
00:20:44.702,00:20:47.580,"PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT."
00:20:53.753,00:20:57.173,- HAVE YOU AND THE PRESIDENT HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK? - WE HAVE.
00:20:57.256,00:20:59.926,- IS HE LEANING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER? - HE'S TORN.
00:21:02.011,00:21:04.263,- AND WHAT ABOUT YOU? - I'M A LITTLE LESS TORN.
00:21:04.346,00:21:06.306,MY INSTINCTS TELL ME IT'S A MISTAKE.
00:21:06.390,00:21:08.893,YOU WANNA CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE?
00:21:08.976,00:21:17.110,"WELL, LOOK, IF YOUR INSTINCTS TELL YOU THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO, I'M NOT ABOUT TO-- FRANK, I'M GONNA ASK YOU TWO VERY DIRECT QUESTIONS, AND I WOULD APPRECIATE DIRECT ANSWERS."
00:21:17.193,00:21:21.488,"WHEN YOU GOT MY SON INTO COLLEGE, WERE YOU ANTICIPATING A MOMENT LIKE THIS?"
00:21:23.074,00:21:24.909,I DON'T FOLLOW.
00:21:26.244,00:21:28.162,"HONESTLY, FRANK?"
00:21:28.246,00:21:34.085,WAS I ANTICI-- I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER YOU DIRECTLY IF I KNEW WHAT YOU WERE ASKING.
00:21:34.168,00:21:37.463,ALL RIGHT. I WILL ASK YOU MY SECOND QUESTION.
00:21:39.132,00:21:42.342,DO YOU WANT THE VICE PRESIDENCY FOR YOURSELF?
00:21:42.426,00:21:49.183,I WOULD SERVE AT THE PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT IF THAT WAS HIS-- YOU PROPOSED THIS IDEA SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE MATTHEWS' PLACE.
00:21:49.267,00:21:51.393,- I DID NOT SAY THAT. - BUT IT IS WHAT YOU WANT.
00:21:51.477,00:21:59.026,"- WHAT I WANT IS IN THE-- - THE PRESIDENT MAKES YOU V.P., HE KEEPS YOU ON THE TICKET IN 2016, AND YOU USE THAT AS A SPRINGBOARD TO RUN IN 2020."
00:21:59.110,00:22:02.446,TELL ME THAT TRAJECTORY HAS NEVER ENTERED YOUR MIND.
00:22:05.199,00:22:08.244,OF CONSIDERING ALL TRAJECTORIES IN ANY GIVEN SITUATION.
00:22:08.327,00:22:11.664,"BUT THAT'S A PRACTICAL EXERCISE, NOT A PERSONAL ONE."
00:22:11.747,00:22:13.666,SO YOU REFUSE TO ADMIT IT.
00:22:13.749,00:22:15.793,ADMIT IT'S WHAT I WANT? THAT'S IRRELEVANT.
00:22:15.876,00:22:17.837,"YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ASKED FOR THIS MEETING, NOT ME."
00:22:17.920,00:22:22.216,"THIS MEETING'S ABOUT TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM, NOT FULFILL SOME PERSONAL AMBITION."
00:22:22.300,00:22:26.971,"BUT IF BOTH COULD BE ACHIEVED, YOU WOULDN'T OBJECT."
00:22:27.054,00:22:32.852,I THINK THIS IS A SOUND COURSE OF ACTION REGARDLESS OF WHO THE PRESIDENT TAPS TO REPLACE MATTHEWS.
00:22:34.979,00:22:37.315,I MUST GAMBLE EVERYTHING I HAVE RIGHT NOW.
00:22:37.439,00:22:39.357,"IF I'M HONEST, SHE MAY USE IT AGAINST ME."
00:22:39.441,00:22:42.278,"IF I'M NOT, SHE WON'T LIFT A FINGER."
00:22:42.360,00:22:45.198,I'VE USED THIS SAME TACTIC MYSELF.
00:22:45.281,00:22:49.660,"ONCE SOMEONE IS EXPOSED, THEY'RE AT YOUR MERCY."
00:22:49.743,00:22:53.914,SHE WANTS TO HEAR ME SAY THE WORDS.
00:22:56.750,00:22:59.503,YES.
00:22:59.586,00:23:02.422,I WANT TO BE THE VICE PRESIDENT.
00:23:10.388,00:23:13.809,"BUT I CAN'T FORCE YOU TO DO SO, LINDA."
00:23:20.316,00:23:23.277,BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE WOULD MAKE A FORMIDABLE TEAM.
00:23:23.361,00:23:28.406,LOOK WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH EVEN WHEN WE'VE BEEN AT ODDS WITH EACH OTHER.
00:23:28.490,00:23:32.119,NOW PUT YOUR MIND TO WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH IF WE WEREN'T.
00:23:35.081,00:23:37.457,"THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME, LINDA."
00:23:44.965,00:23:47.218,I'LL CALL YOU BACK. HOW'D IT GO?
00:23:47.301,00:23:49.511,SHE'S HOLDING HER CARDS VERY CLOSE TO THE CHEST.
00:23:49.595,00:23:51.513,- ANY WORD FROM PETER? - NOTHING.
00:23:51.597,00:23:53.515,CHRISTINA SAID HE WOULDN'T LEAVE THE APARTMENT.
00:23:53.599,00:23:55.642,"BUT I CALLED THE DOORMAN, AND HE SAID THAT PETER WAS GONE."
00:24:00.106,00:24:03.234,- I'M TRYING TO TRACK HIM DOWN. - WHY'D YOU LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE?
00:24:03.317,00:24:05.861,I THOUGHT HE WAS SHOWERING. HE DISAPPEARED WHEN I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH YOU.
00:24:05.945,00:24:12.576,"THERE WAS A PLAN HERE, DOUG. HE EXPLODES, HE WITHDRAWS, WE PUT HIM BACK TOGETHER, AND HE QUIETLY GOES AWAY."
00:24:14.787,00:24:20.876,SINCE ALLEGATIONS THAT HE WAS INEBRIATED DURING A RADIO INTERVIEW ON WZPZ PITTSBURGH YESTERDAY MORNING.
00:24:20.960,00:24:27.341,SOURCES AMONG THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE PARTY IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING OPTIONS TO REPLACE RUSSO.
00:24:35.308,00:24:39.519,THE SWOFFORD CAMPAIGN IS ALSO REPORTING A SHARP SPIKE IN CONTRIBUTIONS.
00:24:49.447,00:24:52.283,FRANCIS GOT PETER TO RUN.
00:24:53.993,00:24:55.911,DID YOU KNOW HIM WELL?
00:24:55.995,00:24:57.830,WE WEREN'T CLOSE.
00:25:07.089,00:25:09.842,DO YOU NEED TO MAKE CALLS? 'CAUSE I CAN HEAD INTO THE OTHER ROOM.
00:25:09.925,00:25:12.052,I DON'T THINK SO. THANKS.
00:25:31.989,00:25:33.907,WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
00:25:38.704,00:25:40.498,ADAM.
00:25:40.580,00:25:42.540,- ADAM-- - JUST GO. GO. LEAVE.
00:25:42.624,00:25:44.751,HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THIS CAN POSSIBLY GO ON FOR?
00:25:44.835,00:25:46.879,WE HAVE NEVER SPENT MORE THAN 48 HOURS TOGETHER.
00:25:46.962,00:25:49.089,MAYBE THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT.
00:25:50.716,00:25:52.759,A PART OF ME STILL LOVES YOU.
00:25:52.843,00:25:55.179,WHICH PART?
00:25:59.099,00:26:04.897,"I CAN'T BE JUST A PIT STOP, CLAIRE, - OR SOME SORT OF ESCAPE-- - OH, COME ON. YOU'RE MORE THAN THAT."
00:26:04.980,00:26:07.525,"- ...OR A TOP-UP ON WHATEVER FRANCIS CAN'T PROVIDE. - OH, FUCK OFF!"
00:26:07.607,00:26:10.027,"HE'S MY HUSBAND, ADAM."
00:26:12.863,00:26:16.742,"I ENVY YOUR FREE SPIRIT, AND I'M ATTRACTED TO IT, BUT NOT ALL OF US HAVE THAT LUXURY."
00:26:16.825,00:26:20.246,"WHICH IS WHAT I FIND SO FRUSTRATING ABOUT YOU, CLAIRE."
00:26:20.329,00:26:22.789,YOU-- YOU HAD A CHOICE.
00:26:22.873,00:26:24.791,YOU CHOSE NOT TO BE FREE.
00:26:24.875,00:26:27.585,NO. WHAT I CHOSE WAS A MAN I COULD LOVE FOR MORE THAN A WEEK.
00:26:33.175,00:26:35.553,I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I...
00:26:35.635,00:26:38.514,AT LEAST YOU'RE BEING HONEST.
00:26:38.596,00:26:42.560,"I CAN'T LIVE MOMENT TO MOMENT LIKE YOU, ADAM."
00:26:50.526,00:26:55.489,THEN YOU SHOULD KILL IT-- WHATEVER PART OF YOU STILL LOVES ME.
00:26:57.783,00:27:02.496,"IF YOU CAN'T, I WILL."
00:27:40.784,00:27:43.579,HOW'S IT GOING? I'M-- ARE YOU WITH YOUR MOM?
00:27:43.661,00:27:46.332,SHE'S DOWNSTAIRS. YOU WANT ME TO GO GET HER?
00:27:46.415,00:27:55.382,"NO. NO. I JUST WANTED TO CALL AND SAY, UH, YOU KNOW, HEY TO YOUR-- UH, YOUR BROTHER AND YOU."
00:27:55.466,00:27:57.176,IS HE-- IS HE THERE?
00:28:00.387,00:28:02.556,OKAY. YOU WANNA GO GET HIM?
00:28:16.570,00:28:19.532,HE SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
00:28:19.615,00:28:22.909,WH-- WHY NOT?
00:28:25.621,00:28:29.500,THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF TV CAMERAS AT OUR SCHOOL YESTERDAY.
00:28:29.583,00:28:32.294,MOM'S MAKING US STAY HOME THIS WEEK.
00:28:38.008,00:28:44.306,"I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING. I WANT YOU TO GO TO, UH, YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW AND LOOK OUT."
00:28:46.225,00:28:48.519,YOU SEE THAT BLACK CAR?
00:28:48.602,00:28:51.355,- YEAH. - THAT'S ME.
00:28:51.438,00:28:55.192,"YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE, DAD. MOM WOULD BE REALLY ANGRY."
00:28:55.275,00:28:58.696,"WELL, WE DON'T NEED TO TELL HER."
00:29:00.406,00:29:05.578,"IT'LL JUST BE-- IT'LL JUST BE, UH-- IT'LL JUST BE OUR LITTLE SECRET."
00:29:05.661,00:29:09.831,"YOUR VOICE SOUNDS WEIRD, LIKE IT DID ON THE RADIO."
00:29:12.834,00:29:14.753,YOU-- YOU HEARD THAT?
00:29:14.836,00:29:17.130,I HAVE A COMPUTER.
00:29:19.675,00:29:22.553,I'M SORRY.
00:29:22.636,00:29:24.555,I...
00:29:24.638,00:29:27.516,SOMETIMES YOUR DAD MAKES MISTAKES.
00:29:27.600,00:29:29.518,- I BETTER GO. - NO.
00:29:29.602,00:29:32.271,I DON'T LIKE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE WHEN IT'S LIKE THIS.
00:29:32.354,00:29:35.023,"IT MAKES ME SAD. BYE, DAD."
00:29:35.107,00:29:36.900,"SARAH, PLEASE..."
00:30:05.178,00:30:06.680,CHRISTINA.
00:30:06.764,00:30:08.307,WHERE ARE YOU?
00:30:08.390,00:30:10.058,"I'M, UH..."
00:30:11.351,00:30:16.106,MM. I'M NOT-- I'M NOT-- I'M NOT DOING SO WELL.
00:30:16.189,00:30:18.024,"WHERE ARE YOU, PETER?"
00:30:21.153,00:30:24.573,- I'M IN MY CAR. - ARE YOU DRIVING?
00:30:24.657,00:30:25.783,NO.
00:30:25.865,00:30:28.577,TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE.
00:30:28.661,00:30:30.912,I'M OUTSIDE MY KIDS' HOUSE.
00:30:30.996,00:30:33.123,- YOU MEAN MADELEINE'S? - YEAH.
00:30:33.206,00:30:35.125,I NEED YOU TO STAY RIGHT THERE.
00:30:35.208,00:30:37.043,"OKAY, PETER?"
00:30:37.127,00:30:39.004,YOU'LL STAY THERE?
00:30:40.631,00:30:42.549,PETER.
00:30:42.633,00:30:45.010,"PETER, ARE YOU STILL THERE?"
00:30:45.093,00:30:46.804,HELLO?
00:30:47.971,00:30:49.222,HELLO?
00:31:19.586,00:31:21.505,I'D LIKE TO TURN MYSELF IN.
00:31:21.588,00:31:23.423,FOR WHAT?
00:31:24.842,00:31:30.597,"A FEW MONTHS AGO, I WAS PULLED OVER FOR DRUNK DRIVING."
00:31:30.681,00:31:32.766,THEY LET ME GO. I SHOULD'VE BEEN CONVICTED.
00:31:32.850,00:31:37.020,"WELL, IF YOU WERE LET GO, SIR, WE CAN'T ARREST YOU FOR IT NOW."
00:31:40.524,00:31:43.985,"WELL, I DRUNK DROVE HERE. ARREST ME FOR THAT."
00:31:45.404,00:31:50.450,WE CAN PUT YOU IN A DETOX TANK-- I WANNA BE FORMALLY ARRESTED.
00:31:50.534,00:31:53.579,MY NAME IS CONGRESSMAN PETER RUSSO.
00:32:02.337,00:32:04.381,"PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, CONGRESSMAN."
00:32:08.844,00:32:10.804,I GOTTA MAKE A FEW PHONE CALLS.
00:33:15.828,00:33:17.370,BUT CHRISTINA SAID HE CALLED FROM THERE.
00:33:17.454,00:33:20.165,- HE'S NOT THERE? - NO.
00:33:20.248,00:33:23.001,BUT HIS PHONE IS. I FOUND IT BY THE CURB.
00:33:23.084,00:33:24.628,SO WE HAVE NO WAY TO CONTACT HIM?
00:33:24.711,00:33:26.964,NOT UNLESS HE REACHES OUT TO US.
00:33:27.046,00:33:28.590,THIS ISN'T GOOD.
00:33:28.674,00:33:30.175,WANT ME TO ALERT THE AUTHORITIES?
00:33:36.222,00:33:39.017,- HE WAS OLDER. - A LOT?
00:33:40.978,00:33:42.521,YEAH.
00:33:42.604,00:33:46.107,"WAS HE A JOURNALIST, OR DID HE WORK ON THE HILL?"
00:33:51.321,00:33:53.156,ALL RIGHT.
00:33:56.284,00:33:58.996,HE WAS SOMEONE I LOOKED UP TO... FOR A WHILE.
00:34:00.998,00:34:02.833,WHY DID IT END?
00:34:04.626,00:34:06.586,HE HAS A WIFE.
00:34:06.670,00:34:10.423,WE BOTH KNEW IT WAS GONNA END EVENTUALLY.
00:34:10.507,00:34:14.011,"I MEAN, IT WAS REALLY..."
00:34:14.093,00:34:16.930,IT WAS FUCKED UP.
00:34:17.014,00:34:21.226,"THE FIRST NIGHT WE SPENT TOGETHER, HE TOLD ME HE WAS GONNA HURT ME AND THEN DISCARD ME."
00:34:21.309,00:34:25.564,"AND WHEN IT ENDED, I TOLD HIM THAT HE'D DONE NEITHER."
00:34:25.647,00:34:29.401,BUT... IT DOES HURT.
00:34:29.484,00:34:31.570,I WON'T HURT YOU.
00:34:31.653,00:34:34.280,"YEAH, YOU CAN'T PROMISE ME THAT."
00:34:40.495,00:34:43.582,- HAS ANYONE ELSE SEEN HIM? - NO.
00:34:43.665,00:34:46.710,HE'S IN AN INTERROGATION ROOM BY HIMSELF.
00:34:48.670,00:34:52.340,NEVER SHOULD'VE GOT MIXED UP IN THIS FUCKING MESS.
00:34:52.424,00:34:54.718,"WE'RE WAY BEYOND REGRET TIME, BARNEY."
00:34:56.428,00:34:59.014,JUST HAVE YOUR GUYS KEEP HIM OUT OF SIGHT.
00:34:59.097,00:35:01.016,I'LL NEED A BACK EXIT.
00:35:27.000,00:35:28.919,- I GOT HIM. THANKS. - YEAH.
00:35:29.002,00:35:30.253,COME ON.
00:35:41.014,00:35:44.142,"HEY, PETER."
00:35:44.225,00:35:46.061,WHERE'S YOUR CAR?
00:35:49.230,00:35:51.232,IT'S DOWN THE STREET.
00:35:51.316,00:35:54.694,"I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME. YOU GO BACK TO MINE, HAVE MEECHUM LET YOU IN."
00:36:01.994,00:36:05.497,"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, PETER?"
00:36:05.580,00:36:08.708,I NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS.
00:36:08.792,00:36:10.710,BY GETTING YOURSELF THROWN IN JAIL?
00:36:10.794,00:36:13.755,REAL RESPONSIBILITY.
00:36:13.839,00:36:19.011,"LIKE-- LIKE THEY TALK ABOUT IN THE MEETINGS, NOT THE LIES WE TOLD FOR THE CAMPAIGN."
00:36:19.094,00:36:21.054,WHAT YOU JUST DID WAS EXTREMELY RECKLESS.
00:36:21.138,00:36:22.973,I DON'T CARE.
00:36:25.934,00:36:28.728,"I'M MAKING A STATEMENT TOMORROW, FRANK."
00:36:30.647,00:36:32.816,- ABOUT PULLING OUT OF THE RACE? - MM-MM.
00:36:32.899,00:36:36.277,THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. I...
00:36:44.161,00:36:46.163,"WELL, LET'S WORK TOGETHER ON THE LANGUAGE."
00:36:46.245,00:36:49.082,I HAVE TO DO IT ON MY OWN. IT'S GOTTA BE MY OWN WORDS.
00:36:49.166,00:36:51.751,"LOOK, PETER, THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT YOU ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?"
00:36:51.835,00:36:54.629,- LET ME HELP YOU. - I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.
00:36:57.465,00:37:00.969,I DIDN'T NEVER ASK YOUR HELP WHEN YOU-- I GOT ARRESTED.
00:37:01.053,00:37:02.888,WHEN DOES YOUR HELP EVER HELP ME?
00:37:05.515,00:37:07.559,YOU CAN LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY YOU WANT TO.
00:37:07.642,00:37:10.020,I'M DONE BEING TOLD HOW TO LIVE MINE.
00:37:12.939,00:37:19.278,"WELL, THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY WITHOUT SHATTERING EVERYTHING."
00:37:22.240,00:37:25.077,ARE YOU AT LEAST WILLING TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION?
00:37:52.020,00:37:54.940,- DO YOU WANT ME TO COME UPSTAIRS? - NO.
00:38:16.669,00:38:19.756,"I KNOW YOU'RE IN A LOT OF PAIN, PETER."
00:38:22.425,00:38:25.220,BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL ANY PAIN TONIGHT.
00:38:25.303,00:38:27.973,HERE. YOU CAN START FRESH TOMORROW.
00:38:28.056,00:38:31.309,"GO AHEAD. I WON'T JUDGE YOU. HELL, I'LL EVEN JOIN YOU."
00:38:36.355,00:38:38.191,JUST RELAX.
00:38:39.901,00:38:41.736,YOU'RE HOME NOW.
00:38:48.576,00:38:52.789,"WHATEVER IT IS YOU HAVE TO FACE TOMORROW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO FACE IT NOW."
00:38:54.916,00:38:57.376,RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.
00:39:01.589,00:39:04.092,THE REST OF THE WORLD DOESN'T MATTER.
00:39:06.803,00:39:14.435,"YOUR CHILDREN, CHRISTINA-- THEY WILL FORGIVE YOU, BECAUSE YOU'RE LOVED, PETER."
00:39:15.979,00:39:17.814,FAILED.
00:39:21.026,00:39:23.111,I FAILED MYSELF.
00:39:23.195,00:39:25.446,I FAILED MY FAMILY.
00:39:26.990,00:39:29.450,I FAILED THE CAMPAIGN.
00:39:31.995,00:39:33.830,"NO, YOU HAVEN'T, PETER."
00:39:36.791,00:39:38.626,MAY I?
00:39:54.767,00:40:00.106,"YOU KNOW, WHEN CLAIRE AND I WERE FIRST MARRIED, WE TALKED ABOUT HAVING CHILDREN."
00:40:00.190,00:40:03.068,I TOLD HER FLAT OUT I DIDN'T WANT ANY.
00:40:03.151,00:40:06.863,IT WAS SELFISH BUT HONEST.
00:40:06.946,00:40:09.699,I DIDN'T HAVE A PARTICULARLY HAPPY CHILDHOOD.
00:40:11.951,00:40:13.245,NO.
00:40:16.039,00:40:19.876,AND I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS RIGHT TO BRING A CHILD IN KNOWING THAT.
00:40:22.587,00:40:28.843,"BUT NOW WHEN I THINK BACK, I-- I REALIZE THAT WAS COWARDLY."
00:40:32.013,00:40:38.644,"I SEE YOU, AND I THINK, WELL, THERE'S A BRAVE MAN, FAR BRAVER THAN ME."
00:40:43.275,00:40:47.445,WHEN I-- WHEN I THINK ABOUT-- WHEN I...
00:40:47.528,00:40:49.948,I'M SO TIRED.
00:40:53.910,00:40:56.204,YOU SHOULD CLOSE YOUR EYES.
00:40:59.624,00:41:01.709,LET IT ALL GO.
00:41:05.338,00:41:08.425,WE HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD.
00:41:13.596,00:41:15.098,PETER?
00:41:23.689,00:41:25.524,PETER.
00:43:42.954,00:43:44.747,I WALKED BACK.
00:44:00.221,00:44:08.605,"WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS, WHATEVER YOU HEAR, WE WILL NEVER SPEAK OF IT."
00:44:43.848,00:44:45.517,SIR...
00:44:50.855,00:44:52.815,THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MEET WITH YOU.
00:44:52.898,00:44:54.484,8:30.
00:44:56.944,00:44:59.155,ABOUT WHAT?
00:44:59.238,00:45:01.366,I DON'T KNOW.
00:45:21.678,00:45:24.472,"NOW, WHEN YOU BROUGHT UP THIS IDEA, I WASN'T SOLD."
00:45:24.556,00:45:28.267,IT STRUCK ME AS BOTH DESPERATE AND CARELESS.
00:45:28.351,00:45:34.982,"BUT THEN LINDA LAID OUT ALL THE PROS, AND THEY CLEARLY OUTWEIGH THE CONS."
00:45:35.066,00:45:39.028,I EXPLAINED OUR REASONING TO JIM AND HOPED HE WOULDN'T THINK I WAS OFF MY ROCKER.
00:45:39.111,00:45:43.575,"I DID AT FIRST, BUT THE PRESIDENT MADE SOME VERY GOOD ARGUMENTS."
00:45:43.658,00:45:45.910,"IT'S A BOLD MOVE, FRANK. I'M VERY IMPRESSED."
00:45:45.993,00:45:48.454,"WELL, THANK YOU, SIR, FOR BEING OPEN TO THE IDEA."
00:45:48.538,00:45:51.123,"AND THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, FOR TAKING THE RISK."
00:45:51.207,00:45:53.125,WE'LL NEED TO WORK THIS OUT STEP BY STEP.
00:45:53.209,00:45:55.712,- THE EXECUTION HAS TO BE PERFECT. - WHERE ARE THINGS WITH RUSSO?
00:45:55.794,00:45:57.922,- ANY WORD FROM HIM YET? - WE'RE STILL TRYING TO LOCATE HIM.
00:45:58.005,00:45:59.965,"- WELL, IS THERE ANY CAUSE FOR WORRY? - IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS."
00:46:00.049,00:46:02.343,"I AM A BIT WORRIED, I HAVE TO ADMIT."
00:46:02.427,00:46:04.554,"I MEAN, THIS MUST BE AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT MOMENT FOR HIM."
00:46:04.637,00:46:06.347,WE'RE HOPING HE'LL REACH OUT SHORTLY.
00:46:06.431,00:46:08.891,LET'S GET OUR PEOPLE ON IT. I WANNA KNOW WHERE HE IS.
00:46:08.974,00:46:11.060,"NOW, ONCE HE WITHDRAWS, WE HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY."
00:46:11.143,00:46:13.646,"WE'LL MAKE A JOINT STATEMENT, AS YOU PROPOSED."
00:46:13.730,00:46:15.772,"IT'S A CLEAR MESSAGE, I THINK."
00:46:15.856,00:46:18.443,"PENNSYLVANIANS MATTER TO US, AND WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THEM DOWN."
00:46:21.529,00:46:26.158,BUT THAT I HAVE GREAT ADMIRATION FOR THE SACRIFICE HE'S WILLING TO MAKE FOR THE PEOPLE OF HIS HOME STATE.
00:46:26.242,00:46:28.745,AND YOU SHOULD NOT ACCEPT HIS RESIGNATION UNTIL HE'S ELECTED.
00:46:34.791,00:46:37.587,"NOW, SHOULD JIM WIN, WE'LL NEED TO NOMINATE A VICE PRESIDENT IMMEDIATELY."
00:46:37.670,00:46:39.631,"LINDA, YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER A LIST OF NAMES?"
00:46:39.714,00:46:43.259,YES. AND YOU CAN BEGIN THE VETTING PROCESS AS SOON AS YOU NARROW DOWN THE CHOICES.
00:46:43.342,00:46:45.428,I ALREADY HAVE A SHORT LIST OF TOP CONTENDERS.
00:46:50.308,00:46:51.976,CONGRESSMAN?
00:46:54.353,00:46:55.938,CONGRESSMAN?
00:47:12.204,00:47:13.748,WE CAN USE THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE.
00:47:13.830,00:47:15.832,ARE YOU OKAY WITH NASH AARONS?
00:47:15.916,00:47:18.586,"I LIKE NASH, BUT I'LL WANT TO BRING IN SOME OF MY OWN PEOPLE."
00:47:18.670,00:47:20.755,"WELL, THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM. NASH IS A TEAM PLAYER."
00:47:20.837,00:47:25.802,AND WE CAN REALLOCATE SOME OF YOUR EXISTING 2016 REELECTION FUNDS-- EXCUSE ME. LINDA.
00:47:26.969,00:47:28.805,PETER RUSSO IS DEAD.
00:47:30.055,00:47:31.974,SUICIDE.
00:47:32.057,00:47:34.977,HE WAS FOUND IN HIS GARAGE WITH THE CAR STILL RUNNING.
00:47:38.481,00:47:40.941,"I'M SO SORRY, FRANK."
00:47:41.025,00:47:44.612,"- MAY I HAVE A MOMENT, SIR? - OF COURSE."
00:47:44.696,00:47:47.906,I WILL GET MORE INFORMATION AND START DRAFTING A STATEMENT.
00:47:47.990,00:47:50.867,LET'S RESCHEDULE. WHENEVER IS BEST FOR FRANK.
00:48:15.727,00:48:21.691,U.S. SECRET SERVICE AGENTS DISCOVERED HIS BODY AFTER REPORTS - ...THAT RUSSO HAD BEEN MISSING SINCE SATURDAY. - FUCK!
00:48:21.774,00:48:29.574,HIS BODY WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE D.C. CORONER'S OFFICE WHERE AN AUTOPSY IS EXPECTED TO CONFIRM HIS DEATH AS A SUICIDE.
00:48:31.992,00:48:36.581,- ZOE. - ...RUSSO WAS 36 YEARS OLD-- - LOOK AT THIS. - ...AND IS SURVIVED BY TWO CHILDREN.
00:48:40.543,00:48:42.754,FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP OF PENNSYLVANIA.
00:48:42.837,00:48:48.593,HE WAS LAST HEARD PUBLICLY DURING A MORNING POLITICAL RADIO SHOW ON PITTSBURGH STATION WZPZ.
00:48:48.676,00:48:57.142,"NOW, DURING THE INTERVIEW, HE SLURRED HIS WORDS, HE SOUNDED DISORIENTED-- - CHRISTINA. - ...LEADING MANY TO BELIEVE - THAT HE HAD RELAPSED... - CAN YOU GET ME A TRAIN BACK TO D.C.?"
00:48:57.226,00:49:05.192,...RIGHT HERE ON THIS TV STATION FOR ALL YOUR LATE-BREAKING DETAILS ABOUT THIS MAJOR NEWS STORY: THE SUICIDE OF CONGRESSMAN PETER RUSSO.
00:51:24.707,00:51:31.839,"I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPRESS EVERYTHING THAT I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW, AND I KNOW CLAIRE FEELS EXACTLY THE SAME."
00:51:34.800,00:51:39.764,A SORT OF MAGNETIC PRESENCE THAT ELECTRIFIED EVERYONE HE TOUCHED.
00:51:39.847,00:51:43.768,AND MY HUSBAND AND I BECAME VERY CLOSE TO HIM THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS.
00:51:47.021,00:51:49.189,HE WAS FAMILY.
00:51:49.273,00:51:55.153,"OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO HIS CHILDREN AND TO HIS MOTHER, TO ALL OF THOSE WHO KNEW HIM AND WORKED WITH HIM AND LOVED HIM."
00:51:55.237,00:51:59.283,WE WOULD ASK THAT ALL OF YOU RESPECT THEIR PRIVACY AND HONOR THEIR LOSS.
00:51:59.366,00:52:06.582,"TODAY IS INDEED A SAD DAY FOR THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, FOR THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND FOR ALL OF US."
00:00:32.199,00:00:34.743,HEY. EXCUSE ME. I'M PAUL CAPRA. I'M HERE TO SEE CHRISTINA.
00:00:34.827,00:00:37.412,"OH, RIGHT THIS WAY, MR. CAPRA. SHE'S EXPECTING YOU."
00:00:44.378,00:00:46.129,"- PAUL. - HEY, CHRISTINA."
00:00:46.213,00:00:48.966,HI. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
00:00:49.048,00:00:50.592,"- YEAH, YOU TOO. - CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?"
00:00:50.676,00:00:52.260,NAH. I GRABBED SOME BREAKFAST ON THE WAY DOWN.
00:00:52.344,00:00:54.304,- OKAY. HAVE A SEAT. - ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
00:01:01.937,00:01:05.816,I ASKED YOU DOWN HERE BECAUSE I SPOKE TO D-TRIP AND THE D.N.C.
00:01:05.900,00:01:07.651,WE'D LIKE YOU TO RUN FOR PETER'S SEAT.
00:01:07.735,00:01:12.322,"AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, THE ELECTION'S BEEN SET FOR THE FIRST WEEK OF FEBRUARY."
00:01:12.406,00:01:14.074,YOU WANT ME TO RUN?
00:01:14.157,00:01:18.746,"WITH YOUR STATURE IN THE COMMUNITY, YOUR GRASS ROOTS ORGANIZING EXPERIENCE-- CHRISTINA, HOLD ON."
00:01:18.829,00:01:20.163,I KNOW IT'S A LOT TO CONSIDER.
00:01:20.247,00:01:21.582,IT'S ONLY BEEN A MONTH.
00:01:21.665,00:01:23.751,"WELL, WE STILL HAVE TO GOVERN, PAUL."
00:01:23.834,00:01:27.546,I THOUGHT YOU ASKED ME DOWN HERE BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO TALK OR SOMETHING.
00:01:27.629,00:01:29.423,I DO. ABOUT THE ELECTION.
00:01:29.506,00:01:31.466,I MEAN ABOUT PETER.
00:01:33.010,00:01:35.387,HOW COME YOU DIDN'T GO TO THE FUNERAL?
00:01:36.764,00:01:39.349,I COULDN'T.
00:01:39.433,00:01:41.560,HOW YOU BEEN HOLDING UP?
00:01:41.643,00:01:44.563,I'M ALL RIGHT. IT'S BEEN HARD KEEPING THE OFFICE ON TRACK.
00:01:44.646,00:01:46.565,JESUS. SCREW THE OFFICE.
00:01:46.648,00:01:48.191,WHAT ABOUT YOU?
00:01:48.275,00:01:50.903,"YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GRIEVE, CHRISTINA."
00:01:53.072,00:01:55.991,"THERE ARE 600,000 PEOPLE COUNTING ON US."
00:01:56.075,00:01:59.536,I CAN'T LET MY FEELINGS GET IN THE WAY OF THAT.
00:01:59.620,00:02:02.205,WILL YOU HEAR ME OUT ABOUT RUNNING FOR PETER'S SEAT?
00:04:08.582,00:04:12.002,"WELL, YOU'VE PASSED THE VETTING PROCESS WITH FLYING COLORS."
00:04:12.086,00:04:14.337,"- IS THERE ANYTHING WE MIGHT HAVE MISSED? - NO, SIR."
00:04:20.761,00:04:24.681,IT'S BEEN VERY REWARDING.
00:04:30.645,00:04:32.856,PARTISANSHIP.
00:04:40.739,00:04:46.870,"WELL, I SUPPOSE A ROOM FILLED WITH 435 BIG EGOS ISN'T THE MOST HOSPITABLE PLACE FOR OVERSIGHT."
00:04:55.629,00:04:58.090,"DO YOU WANT TO BE VICE PRESIDENT, TABITHA?"
00:04:58.173,00:05:01.093,"IT WOULD BE A GREAT HONOR, SIR."
00:05:08.475,00:05:10.518,WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.
00:05:10.602,00:05:12.771,- THAT'S ALL? - MM-HMM.
00:05:18.986,00:05:21.155,WE HAVE TO CROSS HER OFF.
00:05:21.238,00:05:23.240,I AGREE. SHE COULD PUT A CRACK ADDICT TO SLEEP.
00:05:23.323,00:05:25.492,THEN WHAT IS SHE DOING ON THE GODDAMN LIST?
00:05:25.575,00:05:27.410,TABITHA'S A VERY GIFTED LEGISLATOR.
00:05:27.494,00:05:29.412,I DON'T WANT PEOPLE WHO MAKE SENSE ON PAPER.
00:05:29.496,00:05:32.457,I NEED AT LEAST ONE VIABLE OPTION.
00:05:32.540,00:05:36.128,THE TWO OF YOU CREATED THIS LIST AND HAVE PROCEEDED TO CROSS OFF EVERY NAME YOU'VE PUT ON IT.
00:05:36.211,00:05:43.051,"IT'S JUST A FIRST PASS, SIR. WE NEED TIME TO FULLY VET ALL-- JIM IS GONNA WIN THIS THING IN PENNSYLVANIA, AND WE'RE NO CLOSER TO NAMING HIS REPLACEMENT THAN WE WERE A MONTH AGO."
00:05:43.135,00:05:46.721,LET US TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT IT AND GIVE YOU A FEW MORE NAMES TO CONSIDER.
00:05:46.805,00:05:49.891,- I JUST WANT ONE NAME. - WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU BY TOMORROW MORNING.
00:05:58.817,00:06:01.320,"YEAH, FOR THIS TO WORK, I DON'T THINK YOU CAN BE THERE. NOT WHEN I FIRST MENTION IT."
00:06:04.531,00:06:06.200,ASSUMING HE'S OPEN TO THE IDEA.
00:06:06.283,00:06:08.202,"LOOK, ALL WE HAVE TO DO TOMORROW IS PLANT THE NOTION IN HIS HEAD."
00:06:08.285,00:06:10.871,I'M SURE YOU'LL BE PERSUASIVE.
00:06:12.956,00:06:15.042,- MR. CAPRA? - YEAH. WHO'S THIS?
00:06:15.125,00:06:17.127,JANINE SKORSKY FROM SLUGLINE.
00:06:17.211,00:06:20.255,WE SPOKE WHEN I WROTE THE PIECE ABOUT CONGRESSMAN RUSSO'S PASSING.
00:06:20.339,00:06:22.757,"I'M DONE GIVING INTERVIEWS ABOUT PETER, OKAY?"
00:06:22.841,00:06:25.468,HE WAS A TROUBLED GUY. END OF STORY.
00:06:27.386,00:06:34.144,I'M CALLING YOU BECAUSE MY SOURCES AT THE D-TRIPLE-C ARE TELLING ME THAT YOU MIGHT BE RUNNING FOR HIS SEAT.
00:06:34.228,00:06:35.603,I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT.
00:06:35.687,00:06:39.482,"BUT YOU DID HAVE A MEETING THIS MORNING WITH CHRISTINA GALLAGHER, CORRECT?"
00:06:39.566,00:06:41.693,I'M DRIVING RIGHT NOW. I REALLY SHOULDN'T BE ON THE PHONE.
00:06:41.776,00:06:48.325,"IF YOU DO RUN, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE CLOSING OF THE PHILADELPHIA SHIPYARD."
00:06:48.407,00:06:51.036,THAT DECISION WAS MADE IN WASHINGTON.
00:06:51.119,00:06:53.830,THE ASSOCIATION WASN'T CONSULTED.
00:06:53.914,00:06:56.624,FORGIVE ME. I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.
00:06:56.708,00:07:00.254,I READ ALL OF THE TRANSCRIPTS FROM THE BRAC COMMISSION.
00:07:00.337,00:07:02.797,CONGRESSMAN RUSSO DIDN'T GIVE ANY TESTIMONY.
00:07:02.881,00:07:08.469,"SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT HE DIDN'T CONSULT WITH YOU ONCE BEFORE YOU-- SOMEBODY WAS STRONG-ARMING HIM, OKAY? IT WAS POLITICS."
00:07:08.553,00:07:10.972,DO YOU KNOW WHO WOULD'VE PRESSURED HIM?
00:07:11.056,00:07:13.058,"LOOK, I DON'T KNOW. HE JUST SAID PEOPLE UP THE FOOD CHAIN."
00:07:13.141,00:07:17.520,DID HE SAY ANYTHING MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT-- YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S TRAFFIC. I GOTTA GO.
00:07:31.243,00:07:33.203,SHOULD I BE PREPARED TO DO PRESS?
00:07:36.206,00:07:38.417,WHAT DO YOU THINK OUR CHANCES ARE?
00:07:40.001,00:07:42.796,"BETTER THAN 50-50, IF I HAD TO SAY."
00:07:43.922,00:07:46.925,"WE WON'T ANNOUNCE UNTIL AFTER MATTHEWS WINS, THOUGH."
00:07:48.509,00:07:50.429,"I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT I'M NERVOUS."
00:07:50.511,00:07:52.097,SO AM I.
00:07:52.180,00:07:56.726,"IT'S JUST THE LAST TIME, WE FOUND OURSELVES-- THAT'S MY FEAR, TOO."
00:08:03.442,00:08:05.986,IN NO MORE THAN NINE HOURS.
00:08:18.999,00:08:21.084,LINDA'S BEEN IN THERE FAR TOO LONG.
00:08:21.168,00:08:23.962,"IF THE PRESIDENT TAKES THIS MUCH CONVINCING, IT DOESN'T BODE WELL."
00:08:24.045,00:08:28.091,I CAN FEEL IT-- HIS HESITATION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR.
00:08:28.175,00:08:31.219,I KNOW IT'S POINTLESS TO WORRY UNTIL I KNOW WHAT CARDS I'M HOLDING.
00:08:34.181,00:08:36.850,HE WANTS TO TAP RAYMOND TUSK.
00:08:38.393,00:08:40.895,- WHAT? - HE THINKS IT'S A BOLD IDEA.
00:08:40.979,00:08:43.440,THAT'S AN IDIOTIC IDEA. THE MAN'S NEVER HELD PUBLIC OFFICE.
00:08:43.523,00:08:46.067,THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT SAID HE LIKES ABOUT HIM.
00:08:46.151,00:08:49.988,THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO NOMINATE A MULTIBILLIONAIRE IN A STRUGGLING ECONOMY?
00:08:50.071,00:08:56.161,"- HE'LL ALIENATE HALF THE COUNTRY. - WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I SAID, BUT HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR HE DOES NOT WANT ME TO FIGHT HIM ON THIS."
00:08:56.244,00:08:58.246,- SO YOU DIDN'T MENTION ME AT ALL? - I NEVER HAD THE CHANCE.
00:08:58.330,00:09:00.540,HIS MIND WAS MADE UP BEFORE I COULD SAY A WORD.
00:09:00.623,00:09:02.083,"WELL, WE HAVE TO UNMAKE IT."
00:09:02.167,00:09:06.921,"WELL, YOU CAN TRY, BUT IF YOU DO, MY GUESS IS HE'S GONNA CUT YOU OUT OF THE PROCESS ALTOGETHER."
00:09:07.005,00:09:08.756,HE SEEMED ADAMANT.
00:09:08.840,00:09:10.675,WE SHOULD GO IN THERE.
00:09:20.394,00:09:22.770,"WILL YOU GIVE US A FEW MINUTES, LINDA?"
00:09:22.854,00:09:24.689,OF COURSE.
00:09:28.651,00:09:30.695,LINDA FILL YOU IN?
00:09:34.449,00:09:42.916,"I THINK RAYMOND TUSK IS AN EXCITING, BOLD IDEA."
00:09:42.999,00:09:46.044,"WELL, I'M GLAD YOU AGREE. LINDA DIDN'T THINK SO."
00:09:46.127,00:09:48.547,"HE'S A PROVEN BUSINESSMAN. BRILLIANT, BUT DOWN-TO-EARTH."
00:09:48.629,00:09:49.964,DO YOU KNOW HIM PERSONALLY?
00:09:50.048,00:09:52.384,I MET HIM BRIEFLY ONCE AT A FUND-RAISER.
00:09:52.467,00:09:54.844,LAST NIGHT WHEN I CALLED HIM WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAD A MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION.
00:09:54.928,00:09:57.097,DID HE SEEM OPEN TO THE IDEA?
00:09:57.180,00:09:58.598,I SENSED A GOOD DEAL OF RELUCTANCE.
00:09:58.681,00:10:00.267,HE WANTED A FEW DAYS TO CONSIDER.
00:10:00.350,00:10:02.602,"WELL, GOOD. THAT GIVES US TIME TO START VETTING HIM."
00:10:02.685,00:10:07.941,HE'S CLEAN. I HAD HIM VETTED LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS CONSIDERING HIM FOR SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.
00:10:08.024,00:10:09.943,AND DID HE SAY WHY HE'S RELUCTANT?
00:10:10.026,00:10:12.695,NO. DIDN'T GIVE A REASON. JUST WANTED TO MULL IT OVER.
00:10:15.031,00:10:21.204,"I WANT TO SEND SOMEONE TO ST. LOUIS TO SPEAK TO HIM IN PERSON, CONVINCE HIM TO ACCEPT THE NOMINATION."
00:10:21.288,00:10:23.206,AND WHO ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
00:10:23.290,00:10:28.587,"I'D SEND LINDA, BUT THERE'S SO MUCH WORK FOR HER TO DO HERE, AND, WELL, SHE CAN BE ABRASIVE AT TIMES."
00:10:28.669,00:10:31.131,"YEAH, SHE CAN BE A BIT TOUGH."
00:10:31.214,00:10:34.842,I WANT SOMEONE WITH GRAVITAS.
00:10:34.926,00:10:38.472,"BIRCH IS A POSSIBILITY, BUT HE'S NOT ALWAYS BEEN OUR STRONGEST ALLY."
00:10:38.555,00:10:42.476,I'M NOT SURE I WOULD TRUST BOB WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
00:10:42.559,00:10:44.894,"I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO MYSELF, SIR."
00:10:47.230,00:10:50.775,I CAN USE A LIGHT TOUCH AND GIVE HIM THE RESPECT HE DESERVES.
00:10:50.858,00:10:54.237,GOOD. I'LL LET HIS PEOPLE KNOW YOU'RE COMING.
00:10:54.321,00:10:56.364,"- THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. - THANK YOU, FRANK."
00:11:02.454,00:11:04.623,IT'S GOOD WE WERE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING.
00:11:04.705,00:11:07.167,I HAVE TO FLY TO ST. LOUIS TONIGHT.
00:11:07.250,00:11:13.381,"SOMEBODY WAS STRONG-ARMING HIM, AND WHEN I ASKED HIM WHO, HE SAID, QUOTE, - PEOPLE UP THE FOOD CHAIN. - IT'S WASHINGTON."
00:11:13.465,00:11:15.925,CONGRESSMEN GET STRONG-ARMED ALL THE TIME.
00:11:16.009,00:11:18.637,MY GUT SAYS IT WAS FRANK UNDERWOOD.
00:11:18.719,00:11:22.849,"HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSO BEFORE THE SHIPYARD CLOSING, AND THEN SUDDENLY HE'S PROPPING HIM UP?"
00:11:22.932,00:11:26.685,"THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE WAS-- LET'S CUT THE BULLSHIT ONCE AND FOR ALL, ZOE."
00:11:28.980,00:11:32.400,"I DON'T WANT TO SCREW YOU OVER, BUT I'M NOT GONNA STOP DIGGING ON THIS."
00:11:32.484,00:11:34.235,I WON'T SAY HE WAS A SOURCE.
00:11:34.319,00:11:35.820,BUT YOU DO KNOW EACH OTHER.
00:11:37.531,00:11:40.992,"SHOW ME YOUR NOTES, AND I'LL TALK TO HIM."
00:11:41.075,00:11:43.953,THESE ARE THE NOTES FROM THE CAPRA CALL.
00:11:44.037,00:11:46.414,AND THESE ARE THE TRANSCRIPTS FROM THE BRAC HEARING.
00:11:46.498,00:11:50.126,"WHEN THEY GET TO THE PHILADELPHIA SHIPYARD, RUSSO DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING."
00:11:57.467,00:12:04.349,"CLAIRE, I JUST GOT A CALL FROM THE P.R. OFFICE AT SANCORP SAYING THEY WANTED TO SEND A FILM CREW TO TAKE FOOTAGE OF OUR FILTRATION PROJECT IN BOTSWANA."
00:12:04.432,00:12:08.186,RIGHT. THEY'RE JUST USING THAT FOR PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL.
00:12:11.856,00:12:14.609,THEY HELPED US GET THE FILTERS OUT OF SOUTH SUDAN.
00:12:14.693,00:12:16.236,I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
00:12:16.319,00:12:18.863,NO. YOU REMEMBER REMY DANTON?
00:12:18.946,00:12:22.325,YOU MET HIM IN YOUR OFFICE RIGHT AFTER YOU STARTED WORKING HERE.
00:12:22.409,00:12:24.743,- THE LOBBYIST. - I ASKED HIM FOR HIS HELP.
00:12:24.827,00:12:27.581,"WE'RE JUST RETURNING THE FAVOR, THAT'S ALL."
00:12:30.041,00:12:34.254,"CLAIRE, THEY'RE AGAINST EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR."
00:12:34.337,00:12:39.217,IT'S HARMLESS. THEY'LL SEND THE VIDEO TO A FEW OF THEIR INVESTORS AND MAKE SOME COMMERCIALS.
00:12:39.300,00:12:45.932,"THIS MAKES ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE-- THE IDEA-- THEY ARE SENDING THE FILM CREW, GILLIAN, SO PLEASE WORK WITH THEM ON THAT."
00:12:56.610,00:12:59.696,ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IS LOOKING INTO PETER RUSSO.
00:12:59.778,00:13:03.866,THE ASSUMPTION IS YOU STRONG-ARMED HIM INTO CLOSING THE SHIPYARD.
00:13:06.411,00:13:08.204,I DON'T KNOW.
00:13:08.288,00:13:11.541,ALLOCATING THE D.O.D. BUDGET IS ALWAYS A FREE-FOR-ALL.
00:13:11.625,00:13:13.167,DID YOU PRESSURE HIM?
00:13:13.251,00:13:16.463,THERE WERE CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT WERE GONNA BENEFIT FROM THE BASE CLOSING SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.
00:13:16.546,00:13:18.172,I DIDN'T STRONG-ARM PETER.
00:13:18.256,00:13:21.384,I ADVISED HIM TO TRADE IN A LOSING HAND FOR A WINNING ONE.
00:13:21.468,00:13:23.052,HOW DID HE STAND TO WIN?
00:13:23.136,00:13:25.430,HE MADE ALLIES OUT OF ENEMIES.
00:13:25.513,00:13:27.181,THAT'S A VERY VALUABLE THING IN CONGRESS.
00:13:27.265,00:13:32.103,"I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU SOMETHING JUICIER, BUT THE SHIPYARD CLOSING WAS JUST POLITICS AS USUAL."
00:13:32.186,00:13:35.649,I ASSUME YOUR COLLEAGUE IS MS. SKORSKY.
00:13:37.191,00:13:39.110,DOES SHE KNOW WE'RE TALKING?
00:13:39.193,00:13:41.696,NO. OF COURSE NOT.
00:13:41.780,00:13:43.615,BE IN TOUCH.
00:13:47.076,00:13:53.958,"MORE THAN YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT RAYMOND ALAN TUSK-- THE COMPANIES HE CONTROLS, POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS."
00:13:58.588,00:14:03.718,- JESUS. - THERE'S ALSO A COPY OF THE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND DETAILS OF THE BLIND TRUST.
00:14:06.763,00:14:08.682,COULD LINDA BE BEHIND ALL THIS?
00:14:10.391,00:14:14.437,TO GET YOU OUT OF TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS WHILE THEY CONTINUE THE SEARCH WITHOUT YOUR INTERFERENCE.
00:14:14.521,00:14:16.815,THE PRESIDENT HAS NO REASON TO MISTRUST ME.
00:14:16.939,00:14:19.275,UNLESS LINDA TOLD HIM YOU WANT THE VICE PRESIDENCY.
00:14:19.359,00:14:21.736,NO. SHE'S IN WAY TOO DEEP.
00:14:24.197,00:14:26.115,THAT WAS DIFFERENT. SHE BLINDSIDED ME.
00:14:26.199,00:14:28.242,NOW SHE KNOWS MY EYES ARE WIDE OPEN.
00:14:28.326,00:14:30.286,DO YOU WANT THE GAFFNEY BAG OR REGULAR BUSINESS?
00:14:30.370,00:14:34.290,"REGULAR BUSINESS. TUSK CAN DRESS DOWN IF HE WANTS TO, BUT I'M REPRESENTING THE WHITE HOUSE."
00:14:34.374,00:14:36.584,"OH, AND GET WALTER DOYLE ONTO TUSK."
00:14:36.668,00:14:38.753,- LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DIG UP ANYTHING. - I'LL CALL HIM RIGHT NOW.
00:14:38.837,00:14:40.963,AND KEEP YOUR EYE ON JANINE SKORSKY WHILE I'M AWAY.
00:14:41.047,00:14:43.049,SHE'S BEEN PRYING INTO RUSSO.
00:14:43.132,00:14:45.426,- WHAT DOES SHE KNOW? - SHE KNOWS THE RIGHT QUESTIONS TO ASK.
00:14:45.510,00:14:47.595,I WANT TO MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T GET THE RIGHT ANSWERS.
00:14:47.679,00:14:48.680,I'M ON IT.
00:14:49.972,00:14:51.474,McCUDDIN.
00:14:54.435,00:14:56.229,McCUDDIN.
00:14:56.312,00:14:57.856,WHAT WAS THAT?
00:14:57.980,00:15:00.316,McCUDDIN AIR FORCE BASE.
00:15:02.193,00:15:04.404,WAS THERE ON APRIL 12th.
00:15:08.074,00:15:11.952,WOMACK TAKES HIS PLACE. SO MAYBE-- WAIT. SLOW DOWN.
00:15:12.036,00:15:13.954,McCUDDIN IS IN HIS DISTRICT.
00:15:14.038,00:15:15.915,IS THAT THE SHIPYARD THING?
00:15:18.209,00:15:19.960,"JANINE, CALL ME BACK."
00:15:20.044,00:15:22.338,I THINK IT WAS WOMACK WHO PRESSURED RUSSO.
00:15:22.422,00:15:26.967,RUSSO WAS PROBABLY JUST EARNING A FAVOR HE COULD CASH IN LATER.
00:15:30.764,00:15:32.973,DID YOU EVER HAVE TO FIGHT HER TO KILL A STORY?
00:15:35.059,00:15:37.395,ONLY WHEN I KNEW SHE WAS WRONG.
00:15:37.478,00:15:44.110,SHE'S TRYING TO DRAW UP THIS WHOLE CONSPIRACY THING WITH RUSSO AND FRANK UNDERWOOD AND THE WHOLE SHIPYARD CLOSING.
00:15:44.193,00:15:45.737,BUT I'M PRETTY SURE SHE'S WRONG.
00:15:45.820,00:15:47.697,PRETTY SURE ISN'T THE SAME AS CERTAIN.
00:15:47.781,00:15:49.616,- NO. I AM CERTAIN. - HOW DO YOU KNOW?
00:15:49.699,00:15:51.659,- I HAVE SOURCES. - UNDERWOOD?
00:15:51.743,00:15:54.120,NO.
00:15:54.203,00:15:57.081,NO. NEVER MIND. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
00:16:45.087,00:16:47.799,"- MRS. TUSK? - JEAN, PLEASE."
00:16:47.882,00:16:49.759,YOU MUST BE FRANK. COME IN.
00:16:49.843,00:16:51.803,SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
00:16:51.886,00:16:54.430,THE GUEST ROOM IS THIS WAY.
00:16:54.514,00:16:57.642,IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO HAVE INVITED ME TO STAY HERE.
00:17:00.979,00:17:02.939,WHEN WE HAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD BED?
00:17:02.981,00:17:05.608,"WELL, BOTH THEY AND I ARE VERY GRATEFUL."
00:17:05.692,00:17:08.444,I'M SORRY RAYMOND ISN'T AWAKE TO GREET YOU.
00:17:08.528,00:17:11.113,- HE GOES TO BED AT-- - I KNOW HE'S AN EARLY RISER.
00:17:13.407,00:17:15.952,WOULD YOU LIKE A WAKE-UP KNOCK?
00:17:18.496,00:17:20.039,SLEEP TIGHT.
00:17:20.122,00:17:21.958,THANK YOU SO MUCH.
00:18:03.750,00:18:06.920,"I WOULD SAY GOOD MORNING, BUT IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT."
00:18:11.215,00:18:13.593,"- IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. - AND YOU, TOO."
00:18:15.177,00:18:17.471,WAS I MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE?
00:18:17.555,00:18:19.766,NO. I SMELLED BACON.
00:18:26.814,00:18:28.399,COFFEE? BOOZE?
00:18:28.482,00:18:30.401,"AT 2:00 a.m., YOU CAN GO EITHER WAY."
00:18:30.484,00:18:32.319,JUST WATER FOR NOW.
00:18:45.792,00:18:49.211,IT'S FILTERED. YOUR WIFE WOULD APPROVE.
00:18:49.295,00:18:52.172,YOU EVER BEEN TO ST. LOUIS BEFORE?
00:18:52.256,00:18:54.508,JUST THE AIRPORT.
00:18:54.592,00:18:56.010,WHAT DO YOU THINK SO FAR?
00:18:56.094,00:19:00.139,"WELL, I'VE ONLY SEEN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND WHATEVER I COULD SEE OUT THE WINDOW ON THE INTERSTATE."
00:19:00.222,00:19:02.349,GOOD ENOUGH. IT'S ALL PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.
00:19:16.864,00:19:19.075,"LISTEN, UM, I STILL HAVEN'T SHOWERED."
00:19:19.158,00:19:21.661,MY MIND IS ON CHINA HERE.
00:19:21.744,00:19:28.334,"UH, WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU GET A FEW MORE Zs AND WE TRY THIS AGAIN IN A FEW HOURS WITH OUR CLOTHES ON?"
00:19:28.417,00:19:29.919,SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
00:19:30.003,00:19:31.796,MEET ME AT MY OFFICE AT 9:30.
00:19:31.879,00:19:34.799,I'LL HAVE A DRIVER PICK YOU UP.
00:19:34.882,00:19:37.593,CAN I ASK WHY YOU DO THAT?
00:19:37.677,00:19:40.054,- DO WHAT? - TAP YOUR RING LIKE THAT.
00:19:40.138,00:19:44.892,I'VE SEEN YOU DO IT ON TV. TWO TAPS EVERY TIME YOU GET UP FROM A TABLE OR LEAVE A LECTERN.
00:19:44.976,00:19:46.894,SOMETHING MY FATHER TAUGHT ME.
00:19:46.978,00:19:50.731,IT'S MEANT TO HARDEN YOUR KNUCKLES SO YOU DON'T BREAK THEM IF YOU GET INTO A FIGHT.
00:19:50.815,00:19:53.192,IT ALSO HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF KNOCKING ON WOOD.
00:19:53.275,00:19:58.823,MY FATHER BELIEVED THAT SUCCESS IS A MIXTURE OF PREPARATION AND LUCK.
00:19:58.906,00:20:01.868,TAPPING THE TABLE KILLS BOTH BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.
00:20:01.951,00:20:05.038,YOUR FATHER WAS A PEACH FARMER?
00:20:06.873,00:20:10.417,"YES, HE WAS. NOT A VERY SUCCESSFUL ONE."
00:20:10.501,00:20:13.796,- LACK OF PREPARATION OR LACK OF LUCK? - LACK OF BOTH.
00:20:13.880,00:20:16.507,HE WAS BETTER AT GIVING ADVICE THAN FOLLOWING IT.
00:20:16.590,00:20:17.842,HMM.
00:20:49.331,00:20:53.002,"MISS? MISS, YOUR CARD."
00:20:53.086,00:20:54.503,THANK YOU.
00:21:12.230,00:21:14.857,- I WROTE THE PROFILE ON CONGRESSMAN-- - I REMEMBER.
00:21:20.738,00:21:24.033,WE KNOW THAT HE MIGHT BE RUNNING FOR CONGRESSMAN RUSSO'S OLD SEAT.
00:21:24.117,00:21:25.868,I CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT.
00:21:25.952,00:21:29.163,WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO SOME BACKGROUND ON THE SHIPYARD CLOSING LAST APRIL.
00:21:29.247,00:21:31.373,"LISTEN, I JUST WANT TO EAT MY BREAKFAST."
00:21:35.294,00:21:39.882,WAS BEING PRESSURED BY SOMEONE TO NOT FIGHT THE CLOSURE.
00:21:39.966,00:21:42.676,- WHO? - THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.
00:21:42.760,00:21:46.764,"THIS IS COMPLETELY OFF THE RECORD, I PROMISE YOU."
00:21:46.847,00:21:49.767,"- HI, CHRISTINA. - DOUG, HI."
00:21:49.850,00:21:51.727,- HOW YOU HOLDING UP? - I'M OKAY.
00:21:51.811,00:21:53.271,I'M-- I'M GOOD.
00:21:53.353,00:21:56.899,I SAW YOU SITTING OVER HERE. YOU MIND IF I-- NO. PLEASE.
00:21:56.983,00:21:59.110,"MS. SKORSKY, RIGHT?"
00:21:59.193,00:22:01.862,I BELIEVE WE SPOKE A FEW TIMES WHEN YOU USED TO WORK FOR THE HERALD.
00:22:01.946,00:22:04.740,WHENEVER I COULD GET PAST THE PRESS OFFICE GAUNTLET TO YOU.
00:22:04.824,00:22:07.160,- WE DO LIKE TO RUN A TIGHT SHIP. - MM.
00:22:07.243,00:22:09.162,SO WHAT BRINGS YOU TO THE CAPITOL?
00:22:09.245,00:22:13.582,I WAS JUST ASKING MS. GALLAGHER WHO'S RUNNING TO FILL THE VACANT SEAT IN PENNSYLVANIA'S 1st.
00:22:13.666,00:22:16.502,"WELL, THE HONEST ANSWER IS WE DON'T KNOW."
00:22:22.258,00:22:24.551,"THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, MS. GALLAGHER."
00:22:34.187,00:22:38.482,"ANYONE STARTS HARASSING YOU WITH QUESTIONS YOU DON'T WANT TO ANSWER, YOU LET ME KNOW."
00:22:38.565,00:22:40.358,I'LL HANDLE THEM.
00:22:40.442,00:22:43.196,YOU GOT ENOUGH ON YOUR PLATE RIGHT NOW.
00:22:43.279,00:22:46.657,"THANKS, DOUG. I APPRECIATE THAT."
00:22:46.740,00:22:48.575,"HANG IN THERE, OKAY?"
00:23:11.349,00:23:12.390,YES.
00:23:15.186,00:23:17.437,AH.
00:23:17.521,00:23:24.320,"UGANDA, PERU, NEPAL, INDONESIA..."
00:23:24.402,00:23:25.946,NICARAGUA.
00:23:26.030,00:23:29.242,"WELL, YOU ARE QUITE THE WELL-TRAVELED MAN."
00:23:29.325,00:23:31.535,NO. I'M THE MAN WHO STAYS AT HOME.
00:23:31.618,00:23:33.787,JEAN BROUGHT THOSE BACK FOR ME.
00:23:33.871,00:23:36.040,"- MR. TUSK, I AM-- - FIRST NAMES."
00:23:36.123,00:23:38.751,"AFTER ALL, WE HAVE BROKEN BACON TOGETHER."
00:23:41.419,00:23:46.967,"RAYMOND, I REALIZE THAT YOU ARE A VERY BUSY MAN, SO I'M GONNA CUT RIGHT TO THE CHASE."
00:23:47.051,00:23:51.305,THE PRESIDENT SINCERELY WOULD LIKE YOU TO BECOME THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT.
00:23:51.389,00:23:52.932,THAT PART I ALREADY KNEW.
00:23:57.811,00:24:00.522,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW."
00:24:08.072,00:24:09.365,SPEAK.
00:24:13.911,00:24:16.247,YES.
00:24:16.330,00:24:25.589,"NOW, I UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME CONCERNS SPEAK."
00:24:29.635,00:24:31.178,NO.
00:24:32.596,00:24:41.021,I HAVE EIGHT PEOPLE REPRESENTING ME AT EIGHT SIMULTANEOUS MEETINGS IN SIX TIME ZONES RIGHT NOW.
00:24:41.105,00:24:48.695,"I SIT HERE AND ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS, PROVIDED THEY COME IN THE FORM OF A SINGLE YES OR NO PROPOSITION."
00:24:48.779,00:24:52.116,"WELL, THEN, LET ME GIVE THAT A TRY."
00:24:55.911,00:24:57.288,YES OR NO?
00:25:01.459,00:25:03.877,HOLD ON A MINUTE.
00:25:03.961,00:25:05.838,I AM VERY SORRY.
00:25:09.467,00:25:14.388,AND THEN WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET OUT OF THE OFFICE AND AWAY FROM THIS DAMN PHONE?
00:25:15.931,00:25:18.684,BETTY CAN TELL YOU WHERE IT'S PARKED.
00:25:18.767,00:25:20.102,GO AHEAD.
00:25:21.270,00:25:22.813,HE'S DEFLECTING.
00:25:22.896,00:25:28.194,WHAT I CAN'T TELL IS WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE HE'S INCLINED TO SAY NO OR WANTS TO BE WOOED TO SAY YES.
00:25:28.277,00:25:32.781,"EITHER WAY, I'LL HAVE TO EASE HIM INTO THE CONVERSATION, NOT BE SO BLUNT."
00:27:17.719,00:27:19.472,AH.
00:27:21.639,00:27:24.726,THERE IS A COMFORT TO THESE WOODS.
00:27:29.106,00:27:31.317,LIKE THEY'RE MY BACKYARD.
00:27:35.154,00:27:38.324,"WELL, THEY ARE MY BACKYARD, IN A WAY. I OWN THEM."
00:27:38.407,00:27:40.075,HOW MUCH LAND?
00:27:40.159,00:27:42.578,SIX THOUSAND ACRES.
00:27:42.660,00:27:46.290,YOU THINK I COULD GET A TOUR OF YOUR FULTON PLANT WHILE I'M IN TOWN?
00:27:48.041,00:27:49.960,IF YOU'D LIKE.
00:27:50.043,00:27:53.631,BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'D WANT TO BE THERE WHEN YOU COULD BE OUT HERE.
00:27:53.713,00:27:55.841,I'VE NEVER SEEN A NUCLEAR PLANT.
00:27:55.924,00:27:57.843,NOT MUCH TO SEE.
00:27:57.926,00:28:01.096,"STEEL, CONCRETE, A LOT OF STEAM."
00:28:02.640,00:28:06.352,THE PRESIDENT HASN'T EXACTLY BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF NUCLEAR POWER.
00:28:06.435,00:28:14.151,"IS THAT, UH, PART OF YOUR HESITATION-- THAT FEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION-- HE'S JUST BEING SAVVY."
00:28:14.234,00:28:18.238,NUCLEAR ENERGY IS A TOUGH SELL AFTER JAPAN.
00:28:30.792,00:28:33.420,AND YOU DON'T MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON EMOTION.
00:28:40.010,00:28:45.807,"THEY'RE INSTINCTS, WHICH CAN BE OF VALUE."
00:28:45.891,00:28:49.269,THE RATIONAL AND THE IRRATIONAL COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER.
00:28:49.353,00:28:53.399,"INDIVIDUALLY, THEY'RE FAR LESS POWERFUL."
00:28:53.482,00:28:58.654,AND WHICH CATEGORY DO YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE VICE PRESIDENCY FALL INTO?
00:29:01.574,00:29:03.659,DO YOU HEAR THAT SONG?
00:29:08.497,00:29:10.249,CAN'T SEE HIM.
00:29:11.584,00:29:13.419,"SOLITARY, THE THRUSH..."
00:29:34.732,00:29:36.275,IT'S WALT WHITMAN.
00:29:36.358,00:29:38.318,IT'S ABOUT THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
00:29:38.402,00:29:40.487,HE'S OVER THERE SOMEWHERE.
00:29:41.863,00:29:43.282,"YES, I KNOW THE DAMN POEM."
00:29:43.365,00:29:45.284,WE STUDIED IT AT THE SENTINEL.
00:29:45.367,00:29:49.329,"I SAID TO MY PROFESSOR, WHY MOURN THE DEATH OF PRESIDENTS, OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER?"
00:29:49.413,00:29:50.748,THE DEAD CAN'T HEAR US.
00:29:50.830,00:29:52.791,AND HE ASKED ME IF I BELIEVED IN HEAVEN.
00:29:52.874,00:29:54.251,I SAID NO.
00:29:54.334,00:29:56.545,AND THEN HE ASKED IF I HAD NO FAITH IN GOD.
00:29:58.505,00:30:00.966,IT'S GOD WHO HAS NO FAITH IN US.
00:30:02.134,00:30:04.553,DEEPER INTO THE WOODS.
00:30:04.637,00:30:06.555,I THINK YOU'RE BEING PARANOID.
00:30:06.639,00:30:09.767,HE CAME UP RIGHT AFTER I SAT DOWN. IT WAS CREEPY.
00:30:09.849,00:30:12.561,"- I'M TELLING YOU, IT WAS WOMACK. - IS THAT WHAT UNDERWOOD SAID?"
00:30:15.105,00:30:17.899,WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? CONGRESSMEN TRADE FAVORS.
00:30:17.983,00:30:20.444,ONE OF THESE CONGRESSMEN COMMITTED SUICIDE.
00:30:24.657,00:30:26.325,I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE WATCHED.
00:30:32.623,00:30:37.377,UNDERWOOD'S EDUCATION BILL WENT TO THE FLOOR JUST THREE DAYS AFTER WOMACK BECAME MAJORITY LEADER.
00:30:37.461,00:30:40.464,YOU LEAKED THE EDUCATION BILL. AND THEN THERE WAS THE KERN ARTICLE.
00:30:40.547,00:30:43.216,- THOSE WERE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORIES. - WAIT. WHAT WAS THAT GUY?
00:30:43.300,00:30:48.221,"UH, WHAT WAS HIS NAME? HE'S THE ONE WHO TOLD THAT KERN WROTE THE ARTICLE FOR THE SCHOOL PAPER."
00:30:48.305,00:30:50.516,- ROY KAPENIAK. - YOU SHOULD GO TALK TO HIM.
00:30:50.599,00:30:53.268,- THERE'S NO LINK. - EXCEPT YOU.
00:30:56.229,00:30:58.148,"UNDERWOOD'S BEEN USING YOU, ZOE."
00:30:58.231,00:31:00.066,DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
00:31:06.740,00:31:08.950,HE SAYS IT'S IMPORTANT.
00:31:10.452,00:31:12.287,"- HELLO, REMY. - HEY, CLAIRE."
00:31:12.371,00:31:14.707,I GOT A CALL FROM THE P.R. TEAM AT SANCORP.
00:31:14.790,00:31:17.167,THEY SAID GILLIAN COLE ISN'T BEING COOPERATIVE.
00:31:17.250,00:31:20.713,"HASN'T GOTTEN BACK TO THEM, YOU MEAN?"
00:31:20.796,00:31:23.965,NO. TOLD THEM POINT-BLANK SHE DOESN'T WANT THE FILM CREW THERE.
00:31:24.049,00:31:28.387,I'M LOOKING AT AN E-MAIL. SHE WROTE THAT THEY WOULD BE DISRUPTIVE TO THE PROJECT AND LOCAL COMMUNITY.
00:31:28.470,00:31:30.389,"IS THAT HER, OR IS THAT COMING FROM YOU?"
00:31:30.472,00:31:33.600,NO. I MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT I WANTED HER TO WORK WITH THEM.
00:31:33.684,00:31:37.187,"WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE SHE'S DOING THE OPPOSITE."
00:31:37.270,00:31:42.025,"I WILL SPEAK TO HER, AND THEN I'LL SORT THINGS OUT WITH THE P.R. TEAM PERSONALLY."
00:31:42.108,00:31:44.319,"- THANK YOU, CLAIRE. - YOU BET."
00:31:57.165,00:31:59.209,IS GILLIAN AT LUNCH?
00:31:59.292,00:32:02.087,SHE DIDN'T COME IN YET TODAY. SHE'S NOT FEELING WELL.
00:32:05.841,00:32:07.801,WE SHOULD GET GOING. THERE'S GONNA BE TRAFFIC.
00:32:07.885,00:32:09.344,ALMOST READY.
00:32:13.390,00:32:14.933,I'VE BEEN THINKING.
00:32:18.103,00:32:20.313,WAS IT UNDERWOOD?
00:32:27.195,00:32:30.908,"SO, WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT IS COVERING YOUR OWN ASS."
00:32:30.990,00:32:34.119,- THAT IS NOT TRUE. - YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW YOU WERE SLEEPING WITH HIM.
00:32:36.246,00:32:38.749,DON'T FUCKING LECTURE ME ON JOURNALISTIC ETHICS.
00:32:38.832,00:32:42.586,HOW MANY OF THE STORIES YOU BROUGHT ME AT THE HERALD WERE BECAUSE YOU WERE-- I'M NOT GONNA HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.
00:32:42.669,00:32:44.588,FINE. MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE A CAB TO THE AIRPORT.
00:32:44.671,00:32:46.214,DON'T PUNISH ME FOR BEING HONEST.
00:32:46.298,00:32:48.300,YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HONEST. I HAD TO ASK.
00:32:48.383,00:32:51.177,- AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T GIVEN ME A STRAIGHT ANSWER. - YES.
00:32:52.345,00:32:54.264,IT WAS HIM.
00:32:55.808,00:32:58.143,"I-- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THIS, ZOE."
00:32:58.226,00:33:00.771,- DO WHAT? - YOU FUCKED A CONGRESSMAN TO GET AHEAD.
00:33:00.854,00:33:03.398,"I'M NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO EVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT, LUCAS."
00:33:03.482,00:33:04.858,"BUT I'M NOT SLEEPING WITH THOSE OTHER PEOPLE, AM I?"
00:33:04.942,00:33:06.192,"WHAT, SO YOU JUST HATE ME NOW?"
00:33:06.276,00:33:07.444,NO. I PROBABLY LOVE YOU.
00:33:15.953,00:33:18.622,LET'S GO. I'M PARKED ILLEGALLY.
00:33:20.540,00:33:24.127,SO I HEAR YOU WENT STOMPING THROUGH THE WOODS TODAY.
00:33:24.210,00:33:28.757,"WE DID, AND THEN RAYMOND WAS KIND ENOUGH TO ARRANGE A TOUR OF THE FULTON PLANT."
00:33:33.929,00:33:36.181,I'M HERE TO SIMPLY ANSWER QUESTIONS.
00:33:36.264,00:33:38.684,I FIGURED THAT YOU WOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHEN YOU'RE READY.
00:33:40.477,00:33:43.355,THERE ARE TWO MINDS HERE.
00:33:43.438,00:33:45.941,WE KNOW ALL ABOUT THE BLIND TRUST.
00:33:47.651,00:33:49.194,DOES IT CONCERN EITHER OF YOU?
00:33:49.277,00:33:54.324,THE WORDS BLIND AND TRUST ARE NOT AMONG MY FAVORITES IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
00:33:54.407,00:33:58.161,BUT I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT IN THEORY.
00:33:58.244,00:34:03.667,NOT MANAGING OUR ASSETS FOR A FEW YEARS COULD UNBURDEN US FROM A GREAT DEAL OF STRESS.
00:34:06.003,00:34:07.963,WHY DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT WANTS ME?
00:34:08.046,00:34:13.886,"WELL, I CAN'T SPEAK ON HIS BEHALF, BUT IF I WERE TO-- AREN'T YOU HERE TO DO JUST THAT-- SPEAK ON HIS BEHALF?"
00:34:16.137,00:34:23.520,"IF I WERE TO SPECULATE, I THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD PROB-- SPECULATION IS A POOR FORM OF INVESTMENT AND AN EQUALLY POOR FORM OF POLITICS."
00:34:23.603,00:34:25.731,TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.
00:34:25.814,00:34:27.315,I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
00:34:29.317,00:34:32.237,"WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO?"
00:34:36.199,00:34:39.160,IT DOES TO ME. SHOULD I DO IT? YES OR NO?
00:34:41.830,00:34:46.793,"WELL, THERE'S A GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS TO CONSIDER-- AND I'M SURE YOU'VE CONSIDERED THEM ALL."
00:34:46.877,00:34:48.545,"YES OR NO, FRANK?"
00:34:51.590,00:34:54.801,"NO, I WILL NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION."
00:34:57.679,00:35:01.725,"ALL RIGHT, THEN. LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER WAY."
00:35:01.808,00:35:04.728,- WOULD YOU TAKE THE JOB? - IT HASN'T BEEN OFFERED TO ME.
00:35:04.811,00:35:07.146,WHAT IF IT WERE?
00:35:09.983,00:35:12.235,JUST THE SAME AS YOU HAVE A DISTASTE FOR SPECULATION.
00:35:13.946,00:35:16.489,"ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT."
00:35:16.573,00:35:19.451,THAT'S ENOUGH BUSINESS FOR NOW. WE CAN DISCUSS IT MORE TOMORROW.
00:36:17.550,00:36:20.261,"GET IN. GET IN THERE, BRUCE."
00:36:20.345,00:36:22.263,"SORRY. SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, MA'AM."
00:36:22.347,00:36:24.432,"UM, I'M LOOKING FOR ROY KAPENIAK."
00:36:24.516,00:36:27.019,I THOUGHT HIS TRAILER WAS OVER HERE. AM I IN THE RIGHT PLACE?
00:36:27.102,00:36:29.228,YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE A MONTH AGO.
00:36:31.023,00:36:33.108,HE WAS SHOOTIN' OFF HIS GUN TOO MUCH IN THE YARD.
00:36:33.191,00:36:35.234,- DO YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND HIM? - WHY?
00:36:35.318,00:36:38.404,I'M A RELATIVE. HIS-- HIS NIECE.
00:36:38.488,00:36:39.906,SKIPPED TOWN IS WHAT I HEARD.
00:36:39.990,00:36:43.242,HAD A GIRL LIVIN' WITH HIM. MAYBE SHE KNOWS.
00:36:43.326,00:36:44.953,- NAME WAS ECHO. - ECHO?
00:36:45.037,00:36:47.831,"THAT'S WHAT SHE WENT BY, AT LEAST."
00:36:47.914,00:36:50.208,WORKS AT THE TITTY BAR OVER ON 40.
00:36:50.291,00:36:52.293,- HIGHWAY 40? - MM.
00:36:52.377,00:36:53.837,ACROSS FROM THE BURGER KING.
00:36:53.920,00:36:55.005,OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:37:08.226,00:37:09.644,- GIRLS GET IN FREE. - OH.
00:37:09.728,00:37:11.354,- I'M LOOKING FOR ECHO. - WHO?
00:37:11.437,00:37:12.480,ECHO.
00:37:31.166,00:37:32.918,ROY WAS A FUCKING WACKO.
00:37:33.001,00:37:35.212,I WAS STUPID TO LIVE WITH HIM AS LONG AS I DID.
00:37:35.294,00:37:37.380,"- DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS NOW? - I DON'T KNOW, AND I DON'T CARE."
00:37:37.463,00:37:39.632,HE EVER TALK ABOUT THE ARTICLE I WROTE?
00:37:42.385,00:37:45.304,BET IT'S STILL IN THE TRAILER IF IT'S NOT IN A JUNKYARD RIGHT NOW.
00:37:45.388,00:37:47.306,DID HE SAY WHY HE CALLED ME?
00:37:47.390,00:37:50.018,- DID HE EVER TELL YOU? - I WAS THERE.
00:37:50.102,00:37:52.520,- WHERE? - WHEN THE GUY SHOWED UP.
00:37:52.604,00:37:54.355,WHO?
00:37:57.067,00:38:00.153,I WON'T NAME NAMES.
00:38:02.239,00:38:04.074,YOU DON'T OWE HIM SHIT.
00:38:06.826,00:38:08.661,SOME GUY WHO SAID HE WAS A CONGRESSMAN.
00:38:13.875,00:38:16.628,WAS IT...
00:38:16.711,00:38:18.255,HIM?
00:38:18.337,00:38:20.006,NO.
00:38:20.090,00:38:24.510,"HE WAS YOUNGER, TALL, NOT MUCH HAIR, PRETTY GOOD-LOOKING."
00:38:34.562,00:38:36.106,THE WHOLE THING WAS HIS IDEA.
00:38:36.189,00:38:38.733,"WHAT, TO SAY THAT KERN WROTE THE EDITORIAL?"
00:38:38.817,00:38:41.486,THAT GUY DIDN'T WRITE ANYTHING. IT WAS ALL ROY.
00:38:41.569,00:38:45.657,"OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW I SAID THAT I WOULDN'T NAME NAMES, AND I WON'T IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT."
00:38:45.740,00:38:47.826,BUT YOU COULD BE FAMOUS OVERNIGHT.
00:38:47.909,00:38:50.203,"- TALK SHOWS, TV, THE WHOLE COUNTRY-- - NO WAY."
00:38:50.287,00:38:53.123,YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO DANCE ANYMORE. YOU COULD DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
00:39:14.602,00:39:16.896,"- STAMPER, IT'S MIDNIGHT. - TWO THINGS, BOSS."
00:39:16.980,00:39:20.108,"FIRST, JANINE SKORSKY AMBUSHED CHRISTINA THIS MORNING."
00:39:20.192,00:39:22.861,I INTERCEPTED HER BEFORE SHE COULD ASK TOO MUCH.
00:39:22.944,00:39:25.822,"- SHOULD WE BE WORRIED? - I CAN KEEP THIS CONTAINED, SIR."
00:39:25.905,00:39:28.325,- I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW. - ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S THE OTHER THING?
00:39:28.407,00:39:30.409,DOYLE CAME BACK WITH HIS RESEARCH.
00:39:30.493,00:39:32.704,I JUST E-MAILED IT TO YOU.
00:39:32.787,00:39:35.040,"THE PRESIDENT TOLD YOU HE AND TUSK DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER, RIGHT?"
00:39:35.123,00:39:39.002,"YEAH. HE SAID THEY MET ONCE, I THINK, AT A FUNDRAISER."
00:39:39.085,00:39:40.628,THAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE A LIE.
00:39:40.712,00:39:42.214,ALL RIGHT. I HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME NOW.
00:39:42.297,00:39:46.843,DOYLE CATALOGUED ALL THE INSTANCES HE COULD FIND IN WHICH THE TWO OF THEM WERE IN THE SAME CITY AT THE SAME TIME.
00:39:46.926,00:39:49.470,ITEMS IN RED ARE EVENTS THAT THEY BOTH ATTENDED.
00:39:49.554,00:39:51.139,AND HE FOUND SOMETHING ELSE.
00:39:51.223,00:39:55.935,"BACK IN WALKER'S PRIVATE SECTOR DAYS, HE WAS THE C.E.O. OF PIONEER AIRLINES."
00:39:56.019,00:39:59.772,GUESS WHO OWNED A THIRD OF THE STOCK WHEN IT WAS SOLD TO UNITED?
00:39:59.856,00:40:01.566,RAYMOND TUSK.
00:40:01.649,00:40:04.361,MY GUESS IS THAT HE AND WALKER KNOW EACH OTHER QUITE WELL.
00:40:06.654,00:40:08.781,ALL RIGHT. LET ME LOOK THIS OVER. I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
00:40:22.087,00:40:24.047,BUT WHY?
00:40:32.513,00:40:34.557,- DID I WAKE YOU AGAIN? - NO.
00:40:34.640,00:40:36.142,I'D LIKE TO TALK.
00:40:36.226,00:40:38.186,GIVE ME A MOMENT.
00:41:07.715,00:41:09.550,CAROLINA PARAKEET.
00:41:09.634,00:41:11.552,"YOU'RE WRONG, BUT YOU'RE CLOSE."
00:41:12.804,00:41:14.847,THIS IS THE SUN CONURE.
00:41:14.931,00:41:19.936,"THEY LOOK VERY SIMILAR, BUT THE CAROLINA PARAKEET IS EXTINCT."
00:41:22.855,00:41:25.775,"INTERESTING SPECIES, THOUGH."
00:41:25.858,00:41:27.902,VORACIOUS APPETITE.
00:41:27.986,00:41:29.528,AND HE WAS POISON.
00:41:29.612,00:41:31.614,CATS WHO ATE HIM DIED.
00:41:33.450,00:41:37.954,THIS BIRD IS NOT THE ONLY THING YOU'VE MISIDENTIFIED SINCE YOU'VE BEEN IN ST. LOUIS.
00:41:38.037,00:41:40.915,YOU AND WALKER ARE OLD FRIENDS.
00:41:40.999,00:41:43.126,I WASN'T SENT HERE TO VET YOU.
00:41:43.209,00:41:45.253,VERY GOOD.
00:41:45.337,00:41:47.380,"TELL ME WHY I AM HERE, THEN."
00:41:47.464,00:41:49.215,SO I CAN VET YOU.
00:41:49.299,00:41:52.051,FOR THE VICE PRESIDENCY?
00:41:52.135,00:41:56.764,"THE PRESIDENT VALUES MY ADVICE, AND HE TENDS TO FOLLOW IT."
00:41:56.848,00:42:00.059,LIKE WHEN I ADVISED HIM NOT TO MAKE YOU SECRETARY OF STATE.
00:42:04.397,00:42:06.316,THAT WAS VERY BAD ADVICE.
00:42:06.399,00:42:08.360,"YES, IT WAS."
00:42:08.443,00:42:14.115,"ONE OF THE LARGER MISTAKES I'VE MADE, AND I VERY RARELY MAKE MISTAKES OF ANY SIZE."
00:42:14.199,00:42:18.786,YOU'VE PROVEN YOURSELF TO BE QUITE DIFFICULT.
00:42:20.497,00:42:23.916,"KERN, THE TEACHERS' STRIKE, NOW MATTHEWS."
00:42:24.000,00:42:25.960,YOU ATTRIBUTE ALL THAT TO ME?
00:42:26.044,00:42:28.129,IF I HAD TO GUESS.
00:42:28.213,00:42:32.384,A SMART MAN ONCE SAID TO ME THAT SPECULATION IS A POOR FORM OF POLITICS.
00:42:36.721,00:42:42.727,WHAT I KNOW IS YOU ARE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE AT WHAT YOU SET YOUR MIND TO.
00:42:42.810,00:42:54.780,"THAT IS VALUABLE TO ME, AND I'VE ALREADY TOLD GARRETT THAT IT COULD BE VALUABLE TO HIM-- SOMEBODY AT HIS SIDE WITH ONE FOOT IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND ONE IN THE LEGISLATIVE."
00:42:54.864,00:42:57.367,HE IS VERY OPEN TO THE IDEA.
00:42:59.994,00:43:02.914,MY TURN TO SPECULATE.
00:43:02.997,00:43:05.958,YOUR RECOMMENDATION...
00:43:06.042,00:43:07.877,COMES AT A PRICE.
00:43:13.466,00:43:15.385,FACT.
00:43:15.468,00:43:18.471,I HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT.
00:43:21.474,00:43:23.976,HAVE I SAID SOMETHING AMUSING?
00:43:24.060,00:43:30.775,"OH, I'VE JUST SAT TOO MANY TIMES ON YOUR SIDE OF THE TABLE NOT TO ENJOY THE IRONY OF FINDING MYSELF ON THIS SIDE OF IT."
00:43:30.858,00:43:33.069,WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR WHAT I WANT?
00:43:33.152,00:43:35.530,I DON'T SHACKLE MYSELF TO PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW.
00:43:42.620,00:43:43.955,WHICH IS?
00:43:44.038,00:43:48.543,I NEED TO BE CERTAIN YOU'LL GRANT IT BEFORE I'LL TAKE THE RISK OF BEING MORE SPECIFIC.
00:43:48.626,00:43:50.128,A BLANK CHECK.
00:43:50.211,00:43:51.963,OF SORTS.
00:43:52.046,00:43:55.091,YOU WOULD NEVER GRANT ANYONE A BLANK CHECK.
00:43:55.174,00:43:58.136,NO. BUT I'M NOT SITTING ON THAT SIDE OF THE TABLE.
00:44:00.597,00:44:03.516,WE STILL BELIEVE IN HANDSHAKES WHERE I COME FROM.
00:44:03.600,00:44:05.643,DO THEY STILL MEAN ANYTHING IN WASHINGTON?
00:44:05.726,00:44:08.980,- WHO ARE YOU CALLING? - CAR SERVICE TO GET ME TO THE AIRPORT.
00:44:09.063,00:44:10.898,FRANK.
00:44:12.442,00:44:18.197,I WILL TELL THE PRESIDENT THAT I WANT UNTIL FRIDAY TO THINK THINGS OVER BEFORE I MAKE MY RECOMMENDATION.
00:44:18.281,00:44:19.824,LET ME KNOW IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.
00:44:19.907,00:44:21.576,AND LET ME ARRANGE THE CAR FOR YOU.
00:44:21.659,00:44:23.744,"HI. I'D LIKE TO ARRANGE A CAR, PLEASE."
00:44:29.875,00:44:32.253,- HOW ARE YOU FEELING? - BETTER THAN YESTERDAY.
00:44:32.337,00:44:35.507,"BUT I MIGHT TAKE OFF EARLY IF, UH, THE NAUSEA COMES BACK."
00:44:43.681,00:44:48.227,I FIND IT EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE THAT YOU'D ACCUSE ME OF HIDING BEHIND MY PREGNANCY.
00:44:48.311,00:44:50.647,YOU KNEW WHAT I WANTED.
00:44:50.729,00:44:52.231,THE BOTSWANA PROJECT IS MINE.
00:44:52.315,00:44:55.067,"UNDER MY UMBRELLA, USING MONEY I RAISED."
00:44:55.151,00:44:57.403,YOU PROMISED ME AUTONOMY.
00:44:58.821,00:45:01.616,"UM, EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE."
00:45:06.329,00:45:12.043,I PROMISED TO EMPOWER YOU. THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS YOU DOING AS YOU CHOOSE WITHOUT CONSULTING ME.
00:45:12.126,00:45:18.174,I'M NOT GONNA ALLOW A PROJECT I'VE PUT ALMOST THREE YEARS OF MY LIFE INTO-- YOUR PROJECT WOULDN'T BE HAPPENING IF IT WEREN'T FOR SANCORP.
00:45:19.925,00:45:22.679,HOW ABOUT CONSULTING ME BEFORE YOU STRUCK A DEAL?
00:45:22.761,00:45:24.681,LET'S GET SOMETHING VERY CLEAR.
00:45:24.763,00:45:28.434,I RUN THE ORGANIZATION. YOU WORK FOR IT.
00:45:28.518,00:45:31.270,"OUR AGREEMENT IS AN AFFILIATION, CLAIRE."
00:45:31.354,00:45:36.442,"- WORLD WELL ISN'T YOUR VASSAL. - YES, IT IS, ENTIRELY, IF WE'RE GOING TO BE BLUNT ABOUT IT."
00:45:36.526,00:45:38.695,THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU PROPOSED SIX MONTHS AGO.
00:45:38.777,00:45:40.737,IT'S WHAT YOU SIGNED UP FOR WHEN YOU SIGNED THE CONTRACT.
00:45:40.821,00:45:44.909,THERE WAS A GOOD FAITH UNDERSTANDING THAT-- AND YOU DISSOLVED THAT GOOD FAITH BY DISOBEYING ME.
00:45:46.619,00:45:49.330,- DISOBEYING YOU? - YES.
00:45:52.291,00:45:54.586,"I THREATEN YOU, DON'T I?"
00:45:54.669,00:45:57.213,NOTHING ABOUT YOU THREATENS ME.
00:46:02.301,00:46:04.512,"THAT'S UP TO YOU, BUT RIGHT NOW YOU SHOULD LEAVE."
00:46:24.574,00:46:26.743,IT'S FRANCIS.
00:46:26.825,00:46:32.248,"IF THIS REALLY GOES AS DEEP AS WE THINK, AND HE'S ALREADY WATCHING YOU-- - YOU THINK HE'S DANGEROUS? - I KNOW HE IS."
00:46:32.331,00:46:36.127,THEN THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.
00:46:43.509,00:46:45.762,"- HEY, CALLUM. - HEY."
00:46:57.356,00:46:59.692,THAT TRULY MATTERED SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME.
00:46:59.776,00:47:03.279,WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT'VE HAPPENED WITH RUSSO.
00:47:03.362,00:47:06.574,SOMETHING UNDERWOOD COULD HAVE HELD OVER HIM.
00:47:06.658,00:47:10.328,"WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO CHRISTINA GALLAGHER, SEE IF SHE'LL GIVE US SOMETHING."
00:47:10.411,00:47:14.749,IT CAN'T BE ME. IF I GO BACK FOR A SECOND TIME-- I'LL DO IT.
00:47:14.831,00:47:18.461,YOU HONESTLY HAD NO IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT AND TUSK WERE CLOSE?
00:47:21.046,00:47:24.216,PHONE LOG OR SCHEDULE DURING THE CAMPAIGN OR SINCE WE'VE BEEN IN OFFICE.
00:47:24.300,00:47:27.011,"I'D LOVE TO BELIEVE YOU, LINDA, BUT I'M FINDING IT VERY DIFFICULT."
00:47:27.094,00:47:28.887,WHAT WOULD I GAIN BY KEEPING YOU IN THE DARK?
00:47:28.971,00:47:30.348,"I AM AS SHOCKED AS YOU ARE, FRANK."
00:47:30.431,00:47:32.266,"WELL, DON'T LET ON THAT YOU KNOW."
00:47:32.350,00:47:34.602,- OF COURSE NOT. - WHAT'S THE PRESIDENT SAYING?
00:47:34.686,00:47:37.104,HE WANTS TO MEET WITH YOU TUESDAY TO GET YOUR REPORT ON TUSK.
00:47:37.188,00:47:40.483,- THAT'S A FARCE. - SHOULD I COME UP WITH A REASON TO DELAY THE MEETING?
00:47:40.566,00:47:43.277,- NO. MAYBE WE'LL LEARN SOMETHING. WHAT TIME? - 2:00 p.m.
00:47:46.238,00:47:49.534,"- WE HAVE ONE WEEK. - TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT, EXACTLY?"
00:47:49.617,00:47:52.953,TO FORCE TUSK'S HAND. HE WANTS ME BEHOLDEN TO HIM? NO.
00:47:53.037,00:47:55.832,WE HAVE TO MAKE HIM COME CRAWLING TO ME.
00:48:00.545,00:48:02.463,WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT'S HIS STRENGTH?
00:48:02.547,00:48:04.841,NOT IF IT'S SLIPPING AWAY.
00:48:07.259,00:48:09.470,BUT MAYBE WE CAN CREATE THE ILLUSION THAT IT'S IN DANGER.
00:48:09.554,00:48:11.472,THE BRIEF YOU GAVE ME ON HIS ASSETS.
00:48:11.556,00:48:16.853,HOW MUCH OF HIS TOTAL NET WORTH IS... IN NUCLEAR POWER?
00:48:16.935,00:48:20.189,"ABOUT A THIRD. SIXTEEN REACTORS HERE IN THE STATES, 37 WORLDWIDE."
00:48:20.272,00:48:22.191,"WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE HIT HIM WITH."
00:48:22.274,00:48:23.900,WE GO AFTER HIS NUCLEAR INTERESTS.
00:48:28.989,00:48:30.742,THE MONEY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO HIM.
00:48:32.785,00:48:34.787,- WHICH IS WHAT? - HIS LIFE'S WORK.
00:48:34.871,00:48:37.206,GET REMY DANTON ON THE PHONE. SET UP A MEETING AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN.
00:48:37.289,00:48:38.583,YOU GOT IT.
00:48:40.084,00:48:43.671,TUSK UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POWER AND MONEY.
00:48:43.755,00:48:45.840,THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT MAKES HIM DANGEROUS.
00:48:45.922,00:48:49.844,"HE DOESN'T MEASURE HIS WEALTH IN PRIVATE JETS, BUT PURCHASED SOULS."
00:48:49.926,00:48:57.560,I'VE WORKED TOO HARD TO GET WITHIN ARM'S REACH OF THE PRIZE ONLY TO HAVE MY HAND CUT OFF JUST BEFORE I SEIZE IT.
00:48:57.643,00:49:00.772,"ZOE BARNES, HERE TO SEE CHRISTINA GALLAGHER."
00:49:02.899,00:49:04.442,I'M SORRY. I DON'T SEE AN APPOINTMENT.
00:49:04.525,00:49:06.444,"OH, THERE MUST BE A MISTAKE. I HAVE AN 11:30."
00:49:06.527,00:49:07.820,ONE SECOND.
00:49:11.948,00:49:14.951,I WORK AT SLUGLINE. YOU SPOKE TO MY COLLEAGUE JANINE SKORSKY.
00:49:15.035,00:49:18.205,"- MISS-- - OH, WE'RE FINE, THANKS."
00:49:18.289,00:49:22.251,YOU CAN'T JUST COME IN HERE-- THERE ARE THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT PETER.
00:49:22.334,00:49:26.046,- I WROTE THE ARTICLE ABOUT ROY KAPENIAK. - PLEASE LEAVE. RIGHT NOW.
00:49:26.130,00:49:28.591,IT WAS PETER WHO CONVINCED HIM TO TALK TO ME.
00:49:28.674,00:49:31.928,WHAT? I DON'T-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
00:49:32.010,00:49:34.388,- WHY WOULD HE-- - SOMEBODY PRESSURED HIM TO DO IT.
00:49:34.472,00:49:38.726,THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 24th. THAT'S WHEN HE WENT TO SPEAK TO KAPENIAK.
00:49:38.810,00:49:42.647,DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING STRANGE AROUND THE TIME OF THE INAUGURATION?
00:49:42.730,00:49:45.023,"- ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN HELD OVER HIM? - NO, I DON'T."
00:49:45.107,00:49:51.781,"IF HE WAS MIXED UP IN THINGS THAT IN ANY WAY CONTRIBUTED TO HIS SUICIDE, WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO KNOW?"
00:49:51.864,00:49:54.074,I'M NOT TRYING TO CAUSE YOU ANY MORE PAIN.
00:49:54.158,00:49:56.327,I JUST WANT THE TRUTH.
00:49:56.410,00:49:58.245,AND YOU DESERVE THAT MORE THAN ANYONE.
00:50:01.039,00:50:03.167,- WHAT WAS THE DATE? - THE 24th OF JANUARY.
00:02:12.049,00:02:13.968,WHAT WAS THAT?
00:02:14.051,00:02:15.970,THE FAUCET.
00:02:18.179,00:02:20.933,- DID YOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT? - NO.
00:02:21.016,00:02:23.811,I'LL CALL NANCY AND TELL HER TO CALL A PLUMBER.
00:02:39.451,00:02:43.163,ABSOLUTE DISCRETION. CAN I COUNT ON THAT?
00:02:43.246,00:02:46.207,- ALWAYS. - RAYMOND TUSK.
00:02:46.291,00:02:48.710,THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO TAP HIM AS THE NEW V.P.
00:02:48.794,00:02:52.255,- YOU AND I CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. - WHY NOT?
00:02:52.339,00:02:55.216,BECAUSE A THIRD OF HIS FORTUNE IS TIED UP IN NUCLEAR ENERGY.
00:02:55.300,00:02:59.805,SANCORP DOES NOT WANT A PRO-NUCLEAR BUSINESSMAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
00:02:59.888,00:03:02.141,THE MARKET IS SHIFTING TOWARD NATURAL GAS ANYWAY.
00:03:02.223,00:03:05.727,BUT TUSK WANTS TO STALL THAT SHIFT OR REVERSE IT.
00:03:05.811,00:03:07.771,VICE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF INFLUENCE.
00:03:10.482,00:03:14.528,AND IT'S IN NEITHER OF OUR BEST INTERESTS TO SEEP SANCORP'S POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE DIMINISHED.
00:03:14.611,00:03:18.532,- WHAT'S THE ASK? - TUSK WON'T ACCEPT THE NOMINATION IF HE THINKS HIS HOLDINGS ARE AT RISK.
00:03:18.615,00:03:21.451,SANCORP NEEDS TO INITIATE A HOSTILE TAKEOVER.
00:03:21.535,00:03:23.453,HE'S WORTH THREE TIMES WHAT SANCORP IS.
00:03:23.537,00:03:25.622,I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SUBSIDIARIES.
00:03:25.706,00:03:30.127,"WE GO AFTER THE COMPANIES THAT REFINE AND SHIP THE URANIUM, - THE SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT-- - COME ON, FRANK."
00:03:30.209,00:03:33.421,"THERE'S STOCKHOLDERS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, A HUGE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE."
00:03:33.505,00:03:35.423,WE JUST NEED TO DISTRACT HIM.
00:03:35.507,00:03:38.385,SEND A FEW TOKEN SALVOS AND INTIMATE THERE'S MORE TO COME.
00:03:38.468,00:03:43.515,ALL I'M ASKING IS THAT YOU SPEAK TO YOUR CLIENT AND SEE IF THIS IS SOMETHING THEY MIGHT BE WILLING TO CONSIDER.
00:03:43.598,00:03:48.187,"THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES TUSK ON FRIDAY, SO WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME."
00:03:53.233,00:03:55.194,"- I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS. - THANK YOU, REMY."
00:04:02.159,00:04:05.245,"IF HE DOESN'T DELIVER, I'M AN INVADER WITHOUT AN ARMY."
00:04:05.328,00:04:07.622,"IF HE DOES, I'VE GOT A FIGHTING CHANCE."
00:04:07.706,00:04:12.419,I JUST DIDN'T FEEL THAT WE COULD WORK TOGETHER CONSTRUCTIVELY ANY LONGER.
00:04:12.502,00:04:16.173,I THINK THAT'S A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE REASON-- OF COURSE IT IS.
00:04:19.134,00:04:20.510,IS THAT WHAT SHE'S SAYING?
00:04:20.594,00:04:29.352,"MS. COLE CLAIMS THAT YOU SAID, QUOTE, I NEED EMPLOYEES, NOT MOTHERS, AND, QUOTE, GO FOCUS ON YOUR BABY."
00:04:29.436,00:04:31.479,CAN I SEE THAT?
00:04:31.563,00:04:35.358,THAT'S COMPLETELY FALSE. I...
00:04:35.442,00:04:37.527,- I NEVER SAID THAT. - SHE CLAIMS YOU DID.
00:04:37.611,00:04:40.697,"IT'S HER WORD AGAINST MINE, RIGHT?"
00:04:40.781,00:04:43.992,"WELL, JURIES ARE VERY SYMPATHETIC WITH EXPECTING MOTHERS."
00:04:45.619,00:04:47.537,THIS IS EXTORTION.
00:04:47.621,00:04:49.248,"WE DON'T WANT THIS GOING TO TRIAL, CLAIRE."
00:04:49.330,00:04:51.708,YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND ARE PUBLIC FIGURES.
00:04:51.792,00:04:54.128,THIS WILL RESULT IN SOME VERY BAD PRESS.
00:05:01.051,00:05:03.178,- WE NEED THE ARREST RECORD. - THERE ISN'T ANY.
00:05:03.262,00:05:05.889,- THEY LET HIM GO. - THEN WE NEED TO KNOW WHO GOT HIM OFF.
00:05:05.973,00:05:10.978,"IF UNDERWOOD WAS INVOLVED, WE ARE TALKING ABUSE OF POWERS AND CORRUPTION."
00:05:11.061,00:05:12.479,I CHECKED.
00:05:12.562,00:05:15.107,"THERE'S NO FILES, NO MUG SHOT, NOTHING."
00:05:15.190,00:05:21.280,"THEN WE NEED TO FIND THE COP WHO PULLED HIM OVER, OR SOMEBODY WHO SAW HIM COME INTO THE STATION."
00:05:21.362,00:05:23.907,BUT D.C. COPS-- THEY LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER.
00:05:23.991,00:05:25.826,WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL.
00:05:27.535,00:05:29.746,NOT THAT I WOULD TRUST WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
00:05:29.830,00:05:31.748,"YOU KNOW, LUCAS STARTED OUT ON THE CRIME BEAT."
00:05:31.832,00:05:33.750,I CAN SEE IF HE KNOWS ANYONE.
00:05:33.834,00:05:35.710,- WOULD HE HELP US? - I DON'T KNOW.
00:05:35.794,00:05:37.963,- MAYBE. - HELP OUT A COMPETITOR?
00:05:39.298,00:05:41.133,WE...STAYED IN TOUCH.
00:05:49.266,00:05:51.893,THIS TOWN IS WAY TOO INCESTUOUS.
00:05:51.977,00:05:53.561,I KNOW IT'S A LOT TO ASK.
00:05:53.645,00:05:56.397,"I'M STILL TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THE AFFAIR, ZOE."
00:05:56.481,00:06:03.697,IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME A CONTACT AND MAYBE VOUCH FOR ME-- DID YOU WAIT TO BRING THIS UP UNTIL NOW BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT'D BE HARDER FOR ME TO SAY NO?
00:06:03.780,00:06:12.831,"- WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - IN BED, RIGHT AFTER WE-- YOU DON'T ACTUALLY THINK I WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE-- - IT SURE SEEMS THAT WAY. - THIS IS HUGE, LUCAS."
00:06:17.460,00:06:19.754,I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL EVER BE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT MAKES IT EASY.
00:06:22.674,00:06:25.635,- I CAN'T ERASE WHAT I DID. - I KNOW YOU CAN'T.
00:06:25.719,00:06:28.347,BUT THIS IS REALLY FUCKING MANIPULATIVE.
00:06:35.937,00:06:38.565,DID YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAID THE OTHER NIGHT?
00:06:38.648,00:06:48.242,THAT YOU PROBABLY-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
00:06:51.036,00:06:55.207,THAT'S WHY I WAS SO QUIET WHEN YOU DROVE ME TO THE AIRPORT.
00:06:57.834,00:07:01.922,I WAS ANGRY. I JUST BLURTED IT OUT.
00:07:02.005,00:07:04.549,I WISH I HADN'T. AT LEAST NOT LIKE THAT.
00:07:04.632,00:07:07.344,I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU BECAUSE YOU DID.
00:07:13.683,00:07:15.769,I JUST ASKED HIM IF HE WAS STILL CONSIDERING TUSK.
00:07:15.852,00:07:18.146,"HE SAID YES, BUT THAT HE WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU FIRST. THAT'S IT."
00:07:18.230,00:07:20.315,I WISH WE KNEW IF THEY'D SPOKEN AT ALL.
00:07:20.399,00:07:23.484,"WELL, HE HAS HIS PRIVATE LINE. I CAN'T TRACK THOSE CALLS."
00:07:24.819,00:07:26.154,- FRANK. - MR. PRESIDENT.
00:07:26.238,00:07:28.156,TELL ME ABOUT ST. LOUIS.
00:07:28.240,00:07:34.371,"HE'S A HARD MAN TO READ. I DID MY BEST TO PROBE HIM, BUT I DON'T THINK I LEFT ANY WISER TO WHICH WAY HE'S LEANING."
00:07:34.454,00:07:39.293,"I MUST SAY, THOUGH, I THINK HE IS BY FAR AND AWAY THE BEST CANDIDATE."
00:07:39.376,00:07:41.544,WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
00:07:41.628,00:07:45.840,DOESN'T IT MAKE SENSE FOR YOU TO NOMINATE SOMEONE YOU KNOW SO WELL?
00:07:45.924,00:07:48.176,I DON'T KNOW HIM. THAT'S WHY I SENT YOU TO ST. LOUIS.
00:07:48.260,00:07:50.178,"FORGIVE ME, MR. PRESIDENT. I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY."
00:07:50.262,00:07:52.931,I MEANT THAT THE WORLD KNOWS SO WELL.
00:07:53.014,00:07:55.225,"YOU, ME, EVERYONE KNOWS RAYMOND TUSK."
00:07:55.309,00:07:57.018,WE DON'T NEED TO CONVINCE ANYONE OF HIS WORTHINESS.
00:07:57.102,00:07:58.853,BUT YOU SAID HE STILL SEEMS AMBIVALENT?
00:07:58.937,00:08:01.398,WHICH IS WHY I THINK YOU SHOULD MAKE A PERSONAL OVERTURE.
00:08:01.481,00:08:03.566,INVITE HIM TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
00:08:03.650,00:08:05.944,"- WELL, I DON'T WANT TO APPEAR DESPERATE. - I AGREE WITH FRANK."
00:08:06.027,00:08:08.280,INVITING HIM IS A VERY GOOD IDEA.
00:08:08.363,00:08:10.698,"IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT TUSK, YOU SHOULD WINE AND DINE HIM."
00:08:10.782,00:08:14.369,- MAKE HIM FEEL VERY SPECIAL. - I'M SURE WE CAN FIND TIME IN THE SCHEDULE.
00:08:14.453,00:08:16.704,"- LET'S GIVE HIM A FEW MORE DAYS. - WE HAVE LESS THAN A WEEK, SIR."
00:08:16.788,00:08:18.581,I WOULDN'T WAIT ANY LATER THAN FRIDAY.
00:08:18.665,00:08:21.584,"WE CAN MAKE FRIDAY WORK, SIR."
00:08:21.668,00:08:23.795,"ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET'S SEE IF HE'S AVAILABLE."
00:08:33.138,00:08:34.973,- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - SHH.
00:08:36.808,00:08:38.559,- GIVE ME YOUR PHONE. - WHY?
00:08:38.643,00:08:39.894,JUST GIVE IT TO ME.
00:09:11.468,00:09:13.011,STUFF MOVED AROUND? ANYTHING MISSING?
00:09:13.094,00:09:15.138,- NO. - ANYONE FOLLOWING YOU?
00:09:15.222,00:09:17.598,WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
00:09:17.682,00:09:19.600,"THIS IS SERIOUS, ZOE."
00:09:19.684,00:09:22.812,"IT GOES WAY UP, AS HIGH AS THE COMMISSIONER."
00:09:27.984,00:09:32.322,"NO RECORD OF RUSSO GETTING PULLED OVER, BUT HE REMEMBERS THERE WAS A CALL GIRL BROUGHT IN WITH RUSSO."
00:09:32.406,00:09:35.658,THAT'S A FILE ON ONE OF HER PREVIOUS ARRESTS.
00:09:35.742,00:09:39.204,I'VE INVESTIGATED POLICE COVER-UPS BEFORE.
00:09:39.287,00:09:41.748,I GOT DEATH THREATS FOR A YEAR.
00:09:44.959,00:09:46.211,YEAH.
00:09:50.590,00:09:54.177,"THAT IS TOO LATE. REMY, LOOK, THE PRESIDENT IS GONNA NOMINATE TUSK IN A WEEK OR LESS."
00:09:54.261,00:09:57.972,"I'VE URGED SCOTT CUNNINGHAM TO CALL A SPECIAL MEETING, BUT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT."
00:10:00.267,00:10:02.102,I WANT TO MEET SCOTT CUNNINGHAM MYSELF.
00:10:02.185,00:10:04.438,I'M NOT SITTING YOU DOWN WITH SCOTT. YOU KNOW THE RULES.
00:10:04.521,00:10:06.314,THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.
00:10:06.398,00:10:09.650,"FRANK, SANCORP'S OFFICERS DO NOT MEET WITH POLITICIANS, PERIOD."
00:10:09.734,00:10:12.946,"YOU TALK TO ME, I TALK TO SCOTT CUNNINGHAM, AND VICE VERSA. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS."
00:10:13.029,00:10:14.573,"ALL RIGHT, REMY. WHATEVER YOU THINK BEST."
00:10:14.655,00:10:16.199,I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I KNOW MORE.
00:10:18.410,00:10:21.662,"OF ALL THE THINGS I HOLD IN HIGH REGARD, RULES ARE NOT ONE OF THEM."
00:10:21.746,00:10:26.876,I WILL NOT PLACE MY FATE SOLELY IN THE HANDS OF A MIDDLEMAN IF I CAN GO DIRECTLY TO THE SUPPLIER.
00:10:26.960,00:10:29.421,BOOK A FLIGHT TO ATLANTA. TOMORROW MORNING. LET MEECHUM KNOW.
00:10:29.504,00:10:31.172,"YES, SIR."
00:10:32.591,00:10:40.681,"SHE GREW UP IN LYNCHBURG, VIRGINIA, WENT TO LORIMER HIGH SCHOOL UNTIL SHE DROPPED OUT SOPHOMORE YEAR, AND THEN AFTER THAT, THERE'S NO PUBLIC RECORD."
00:10:45.770,00:10:47.688,ONE OF US HAS TO GO TO LYNCHBURG.
00:10:47.772,00:10:51.234,"- PARENTS, CLASSMATES, TEACHERS-- - I'LL DO IT."
00:10:51.318,00:10:55.029,"OKAY. WELL, THEN, YOU AND I HAVE TO CALL ESCORT SERVICES."
00:10:55.113,00:10:59.867,"I'M WILLING TO LEND A HAND, BUT NOT BY MAKING COLD CALLS 12 HOURS A DAY JUST TO GET HUNG UP ON BY HOOKERS."
00:10:59.951,00:11:01.495,WHERE WAS SHE ARRESTED?
00:11:05.624,00:11:07.792,THAT'S THE ADDRESS OF THE DISTRICT GRAND HOTEL.
00:11:28.229,00:11:31.065,REMY DANTON EXISTS SO WE DON'T HAVE TO MEET.
00:11:31.149,00:11:33.652,I NEEDED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
00:11:33.734,00:11:40.408,THERE'S A CONGRESSIONAL TRAVEL REPORT THAT PUTS YOU ON A TRIP TO ATLANTA THE SAME DAY I WAS PULLED OUT OF AN INVESTORS' BRIEFING.
00:11:40.492,00:11:43.662,THOSE ARE THE SORT OF COINCIDENCES WE WANT TO AVOID.
00:11:43.744,00:11:46.247,WERE YOU BRIEFING YOUR INVESTORS ON RAYMOND TUSK?
00:11:48.124,00:11:50.043,MEECHUM CAN BE TRUSTED.
00:11:50.126,00:11:51.961,WHY WOULD I BE SPEAKING TO THEM ABOUT TUSK?
00:11:52.045,00:11:54.464,- I THOUGHT REMY FILLED YOU IN. - NO.
00:11:54.548,00:11:56.508,HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION?
00:11:56.591,00:11:59.386,HE DIDN'T. AND I HAVE A FEELING I'D RATHER NOT BE TOLD.
00:11:59.469,00:12:01.221,"TRUST ME, YOU WANT TO KNOW."
00:12:01.304,00:12:03.306,"I'VE APPEARED IN FRONT OF GRAND JURIES BEFORE, FRANK."
00:12:03.390,00:12:05.975,IT'S MUCH EASIER WHEN YOU CAN TELL THE TRUTH.
00:12:06.059,00:12:08.978,"PLEASE, DON'T PUT ME IN A POSITION WHERE I HAVE TO LIE."
00:12:09.062,00:12:15.943,"IF TUSK HAS THE PRESIDENT'S EAR, YOU WILL SEE THIS ADMINISTRATION SHIFT ITS SUPPORT TOWARD NUCLEAR ENERGY AND AWAY FROM NATURAL GAS."
00:12:16.027,00:12:18.405,HIS SUBSIDIARIES AND HIS SUPPLIERS. GO AFTER THEM.
00:12:18.488,00:12:20.323,"FRANK, WE SHOULD END THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW."
00:12:20.407,00:12:24.536,HE WILL NOT ACCEPT THE NOMINATION IF HIS ASSETS ARE IN A BLIND TRUST AND HE CAN'T FIGHT OFF THE THREAT.
00:12:24.619,00:12:28.081,"- OKAY, WE'RE DONE. - SCOTT-- I DON'T WANNA HEAR ANOTHER WORD."
00:12:31.585,00:12:33.294,GO BACK TO THE AIRPORT.
00:12:33.378,00:12:38.258,FIGURE OUT A GOOD REASON YOU NEEDED TO BE IN ATLANTA TODAY.
00:12:51.646,00:12:54.023,- ONE LAST ONE? - ANOTHER.
00:13:05.577,00:13:07.495,- CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING? - WHITE WINE.
00:13:13.918,00:13:16.504,THEY'RE ABOUT TO CALL LAST CALL.
00:13:16.588,00:13:19.633,THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A TOLERANCE.
00:13:37.400,00:13:39.486,HEY.
00:13:39.569,00:13:42.447,YOU SHOULD HEAD UPSTAIRS.
00:13:42.530,00:13:44.616,I WAS WAITING FOR YOU.
00:13:44.699,00:13:47.034,- IS THAT THE NEW FAUCET? - YEAH.
00:13:50.330,00:13:52.499,NOT GOOD. REMY'S UP TO SOMETHING.
00:13:52.582,00:13:55.794,HE'S NOT RETURNING MY PHONE CALLS.
00:13:55.876,00:13:58.879,WHAT CAN I DO?
00:13:58.963,00:14:01.215,TELL ME WHAT YOU WERE DREAMING.
00:14:03.009,00:14:05.345,"OH, IT WAS SO AWFUL, FRANCIS."
00:14:06.929,00:14:09.098,HE'S NOT LETTING ME SLEEP EITHER.
00:14:10.767,00:14:13.520,YEAH. IT'S NOT HIM. IT'S THE KIDS.
00:14:15.396,00:14:22.696,"I WAS PLAYING WITH THEM IN THE BACKYARD, AND THE GIRL WAS CLIMBING ON THE VINES, AND I KEPT TELLING HER TO STOP AND GET DOWN, AND..."
00:14:29.661,00:14:37.001,"AND SHE WAS SCREAMING SO LOUD, AND I JUST KEPT PULLING HARDER AND HARDER, AND SHE JUST RIPPED IN HALF."
00:14:39.462,00:14:42.048,COME HERE. COME HERE. OKAY.
00:14:59.482,00:15:01.067,OH!
00:15:02.819,00:15:04.278,JESUS!
00:15:21.421,00:15:23.923,YOU WAIT UNTIL AFTER 2:00 IN THE MORNING TO RETURN MY CALL?
00:15:24.006,00:15:25.592,YOU TRYING TO GET MY VOICEMAIL?
00:15:27.176,00:15:29.262,WE CAN'T BE HAVING ON CELL PHONES.
00:15:29.345,00:15:30.597,WHERE ARE YOU?
00:15:32.849,00:15:35.226,CLAIRE IS SLEEPING UPSTAIRS.
00:15:39.731,00:15:41.482,YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO SEE CUNNINGHAM.
00:15:41.566,00:15:43.484,HE SAYS YOU DIDN'T BRING UP TUSK.
00:15:43.568,00:15:45.445,YOU REALLY THINK HE'D ADMIT TO THAT?
00:15:45.528,00:15:48.030,"IF WE GO THROUGH WITH THIS, IT'S INSIDER TRADING."
00:15:48.114,00:15:51.075,HE DIDN'T STRIKE ME AS A MAN HEARING THE NEWS FOR THE SECOND TIME.
00:15:51.158,00:15:53.994,YOU WANT TO BELIEVE I'M PLAYING GAMES? I CAN WALK AWAY FROM THE WHOLE THING.
00:15:54.078,00:15:55.496,BUT I'M ALL YOU'VE GOT RIGHT NOW.
00:15:55.580,00:15:59.083,"I'M THE ONE DOING YOU AND SANCORP A FAVOR, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND."
00:15:59.166,00:16:00.752,"I CAN TELL WHEN I'M BEING USED, FRANK."
00:16:00.835,00:16:04.756,- I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT FOR. - I DON'T USE PEOPLE UNLESS I CAN THROW THEM AWAY AFTERWARDS.
00:16:04.839,00:16:07.258,I'M TRYING TO STRENGTHEN OUR PARTNERSHIP.
00:16:07.341,00:16:09.719,SMELLS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE BULLSHIT.
00:16:09.803,00:16:11.805,DON'T CONDESCEND.
00:16:11.888,00:16:17.560,EIGHT YEARS I WORKED ON YOUR STAFF AND NEVER ONCE MADE IT FURTHER THAN YOUR FRONT DOORSTEP.
00:16:17.644,00:16:20.020,"WELL, NOW I'M IN YOUR LIVING ROOM, FRANK."
00:16:20.104,00:16:26.653,"IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME, IT'S BECAUSE I FINALLY WOKE UP TO WHAT MY VALUE IS AND HOW UNDERVALUED I WAS SLAVING AWAY FOR YOU."
00:16:26.736,00:16:30.281,THIS IS BUSINESS. KEEP YOUR SOB STORY TO YOURSELF.
00:16:30.364,00:16:40.166,"I WANT TO MAINTAIN THE INFLUENCE THAT I HAVE WORKED TO ACHIEVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHICH TRANSLATES INTO THE INFLUENCE THAT YOU HAVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THROUGH ME."
00:16:50.468,00:16:53.095,I'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH SCOTT AGAIN TOMORROW.
00:16:53.179,00:16:54.764,SEE IF WE CAN PUSH THIS FORWARD FASTER.
00:16:54.848,00:16:56.015,"THANK YOU, REMY."
00:16:56.098,00:16:58.017,BUT YOU GOTTA LET ME DO THIS MY WAY.
00:17:05.900,00:17:09.904,"THE MESSAGE WAS VERY CLEAR. SHE DOESN'T WANT A SETTLEMENT, NO MATTER WHAT THE FIGURE."
00:17:09.988,00:17:11.572,EVEN IF WE GIVE HER WORLD WELL BACK?
00:17:11.656,00:17:13.157,SHE WANTS TO GO TO COURT.
00:17:13.240,00:17:16.452,THEY SAID WE CAN EXPECT A FORMAL SUMMONS NEXT WEEK.
00:17:16.536,00:17:18.872,- THIS IS LUDICROUS. - HER LAWYERS AGREE.
00:17:18.955,00:17:21.833,"THEY'D MUCH PREFER A SETTLEMENT TOO, BUT SHE'S NOT PLAYING BALL."
00:17:21.916,00:17:30.132,"I'LL KEEP PUSHING THEM. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, YOU SHOULD START GATHERING ALL THE CORRESPONDENCE YOU EVER HAD WITH HER-- E-MAILS, NOTES, EVERY SCRAP OF PAPER."
00:17:30.216,00:17:31.342,"OKAY. THANKS, OLIVER."
00:17:36.430,00:17:39.225,ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS FIND HER.
00:17:39.308,00:17:48.943,"I'VE GOT AN ARREST RECORD FROM APRIL 2012, AND I KNOW SHE WAS PULLED OVER WITH A CLIENT IN JANUARY."
00:17:54.032,00:17:56.868,WHY DID SHE DROP OUT?
00:17:56.951,00:18:03.207,"LIKE I SAID, IT'S AN ETHICAL BREACH FOR ME TO DISCUSS ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO-- I SPOKE TO HER PARENTS."
00:18:03.290,00:18:04.918,HER FATHER WAS VERY COMBATIVE.
00:18:05.001,00:18:07.336,WAS THERE TROUBLE AT HOME?
00:18:08.755,00:18:11.340,THE FATHER-- DID HE...
00:18:12.967,00:18:14.761,I WON'T SPEAK ABOUT RACHEL.
00:18:16.470,00:18:24.478,"CAN YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT YOUR JOB IN GENERAL, THE SORTS OF CASES YOU DEAL WITH, IN AN ABSTRACT WAY?"
00:18:28.775,00:18:39.452,"WHEN I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A STUDENT, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S POSSIBLE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY INVOLVED, IT'S MY DUTY TO CONTACT THE D.A.'S OFFICE."
00:18:39.535,00:18:45.124,"NOW, IF THE D.A. PURSUES CHARGES, THE STUDENT HAS TO TESTIFY AGAINST THEIR OWN PARENT."
00:18:45.207,00:18:48.086,THAT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION FOR A YOUNG PERSON TO MAKE.
00:18:48.168,00:18:51.213,EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.
00:18:53.424,00:18:56.218,IT COULD BE EASIER TO RUN AWAY.
00:18:56.302,00:19:01.891,IT'S SET FOR TOMORROW. TUSK LANDS AT 7:30 AND THEN HEADS STRAIGHT TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR DINNER WITH THE PRESIDENT.
00:19:01.975,00:19:04.226,- IS IT ON THE OFFICIAL SCHEDULE? - NO.
00:19:04.310,00:19:06.270,"- WE NEED IT TO BE. - WELL, I CAN'T DO THAT."
00:19:11.943,00:19:14.445,"ACTUALLY, THAT'S GOOD. WE CAN MAKE THAT WORK."
00:19:17.490,00:19:19.117,SO HE CAN GIVE HIM HIS TWO CENTS ABOUT WHO HE WILL NOMINATE.
00:19:19.199,00:19:20.827,I DON'T THINK WE WANT BIRCH GETTING INVOLVED.
00:19:20.910,00:19:23.121,- HE'LL NEVER GET THE CHANCE. - WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING?
00:19:23.203,00:19:26.582,CAN YOU SET UP A MEETING FOR LATER TODAY? YES OR NO?
00:19:26.666,00:19:30.461,- I'M SURE I CAN SQUEEZE IT IN. - GOOD. I'LL TALK TO BIRCH. GET HIM ON THE PHONE.
00:19:30.544,00:19:32.880,"THIS HAS TO STAY OFF THE BOOKS, JUST LIKE THE DINNER WITH TUSK."
00:19:32.964,00:19:38.302,"- OKAY. - AND FINALLY, DO YOU HAVE A SCHEDULER THAT YOU CAN FIRE?"
00:20:02.326,00:20:05.913,- WHAT IS THIS? - THE PRESIDENT'S O.T.R. SCHEDULE BETWEEN NOW AND FRIDAY.
00:20:05.997,00:20:08.041,- HOW'D YOU GET THIS? - IT DOESN'T MATTER.
00:20:08.124,00:20:10.084,LOOK WHO HE'S MEETING WITH THIS AFTERNOON.
00:20:10.168,00:20:13.546,- BOB BIRCH. - AND LOOK AT FRIDAY NIGHT.
00:20:13.629,00:20:16.632,RAYMOND TUSK. THESE AREN'T THE CRAZIEST MEETINGS FOR HIM TO BE HAVING.
00:20:16.716,00:20:18.843,THEN WHY AREN'T THEY ON THE OFFICIAL SCHEDULE?
00:20:22.972,00:20:25.016,HE'S CONSIDERING THEM FOR VICE PRESIDENT.
00:20:25.099,00:20:28.686,I'D SAY THAT'S REASON ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM SECRET.
00:20:28.769,00:20:31.605,"GET THIS OUT, RIGHT AWAY."
00:20:31.689,00:20:35.442,"MR. SPEAKER, I'M HEARING THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE CONSIDERED FOR THE VICE PRESIDENCY."
00:20:35.526,00:20:37.570,SLUGLINE IS REPORTING THAT YOU'RE HEADING TO THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.
00:20:37.653,00:20:39.655,"- I'M, UH-- NO. - YOU'RE NOT HEADED TO THE WHITE HOUSE?"
00:20:39.739,00:20:42.366,YES. THE PRESIDENT JUST WANTS MY INPUT.
00:20:42.449,00:20:44.911,BUT THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU MIGHT BE UNDER CONSIDERATION YOURSELF.
00:20:44.994,00:20:46.913,NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF. EXCUSE ME.
00:20:46.996,00:20:50.541,"- HOW DID THE SCHEDULE GET OUT? - IT GOT LEAKED, SIR, BY SOMEONE IN THE SCHEDULING OFFICE."
00:20:50.624,00:20:52.126,- ON PURPOSE? - ACCIDENTALLY.
00:20:52.210,00:20:54.003,A WRONG ATTACHMENT TO AN E-MAIL THAT WENT WIDE.
00:20:54.087,00:20:55.588,"WELL, WHOEVER IT WAS, I WANT THEM OUT."
00:20:55.671,00:20:57.924,I ALREADY LET THEM GO.
00:21:00.760,00:21:02.678,"WELL, CANCEL THE MEETING. TELL HIM SOMETHING CAME UP."
00:21:02.762,00:21:05.139,"- I DON'T WANT TO FEED THE FRENZY. - YES, SIR."
00:21:11.353,00:21:13.272,"GIVE ME THE PRIVATE LINE, PLEASE."
00:21:13.355,00:21:17.860,THERE ARE THREE SATELLITE TRUCKS ON MY STREET.
00:21:19.946,00:21:21.739,SOMEBODY IN THE SCHEDULING OFFICE FUCKED UP.
00:21:23.991,00:21:25.910,ABSOLUTELY NOT.
00:21:44.595,00:21:47.223,"EVERY TIME I'VE SPOKEN TO YOU, YOU'VE NEVER SPOKEN BACK."
00:21:50.059,00:21:56.190,"ALTHOUGH, GIVEN OUR MUTUAL DISDAIN, I CAN'T BLAME YOU FOR THE SILENT TREATMENT."
00:21:56.274,00:21:59.693,PERHAPS I'M SPEAKING TO THE WRONG AUDIENCE.
00:21:59.777,00:22:01.904,CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:22:01.988,00:22:05.616,"ARE YOU EVEN CAPABLE OF LANGUAGE, OR DO YOU ONLY UNDERSTAND DEPRAVITY?"
00:22:09.162,00:22:11.956,"PETER, IS THAT YOU?"
00:22:12.039,00:22:14.875,STOP HIDING IN MY THOUGHTS AND COME OUT.
00:22:14.959,00:22:18.378,HAVE THE COURAGE IN DEATH THAT YOU NEVER HAD IN LIFE.
00:22:18.462,00:22:22.008,"COME OUT, LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND SAY WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY."
00:22:32.852,00:22:35.729,THERE IS NO SOLACE ABOVE OR BELOW.
00:22:35.813,00:22:43.154,"ONLY US-- SMALL, SOLITARY, STRIVING, BATTLING ONE ANOTHER."
00:22:43.237,00:22:46.782,"I PRAY TO MYSELF, FOR MYSELF."
00:23:40.294,00:23:43.505,HELLO?
00:23:43.589,00:23:46.092,WHO IS IT?
00:23:50.179,00:23:52.430,MY LAWYER SAID I SHOULDN'T BE TALKING TO YOU.
00:23:52.514,00:23:55.351,"- MINE SAID THE SAME THING. - I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE MY MIND, CLAIRE."
00:23:55.433,00:23:58.354,"I MADE A MISTAKE. I GOT UPSET, AND I ACTED IMPULSIVELY."
00:23:58.436,00:24:02.191,I WAS THE ONE WHO MADE THE MISTAKE BY PARTNERING WITH YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE.
00:24:02.275,00:24:09.698,"WELL, THEN, CAN WE PLEASE BOTH ADMIT THAT IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE, AND WE CAN FIND AN AMICABLE WAY-- - NO, WE CAN'T. - WHAT DO YOU WANT?"
00:24:09.782,00:24:11.742,TO SEND A MESSAGE.
00:24:11.825,00:24:17.290,"ORGANIZATIONS LIKE YOURS GET 90% OF THE GRANT MONEY, THEN COZY UP TO CORPORATE SPONSORS WHO DESTROY THE ENVIRONMENT."
00:24:17.373,00:24:20.126,THE THINGS YOU'RE CLAIMING ARE LIES.
00:24:20.209,00:24:22.878,I NEVER MENTIONED YOUR PREGNANCY.
00:24:22.962,00:24:25.005,I GOT IN TOUCH WITH EVELYN BAXTER.
00:24:25.089,00:24:27.841,REMEMBER HER? WE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION.
00:24:27.925,00:24:31.137,IT SEEMS THAT YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF AXING PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH YOU.
00:24:31.220,00:24:33.389,SHE'LL BE TESTIFYING ON MY BEHALF.
00:24:33.471,00:24:35.975,SO WILL EIGHT OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU MADE HER FIRE.
00:24:36.058,00:24:41.730,"IF YOU WANT AN APOLOGY, I'M HERE TO OFFER YOU ONE, AND TO GIVE YOU WHATEVER YOU THINK IS FAIR."
00:24:41.814,00:24:45.192,THIS CASE IS GONNA GET NATIONAL ATTENTION BECAUSE OF WHO YOU'RE MARRIED TO.
00:24:45.276,00:24:48.237,I'LL HAVE A PLATFORM TO SAY WHAT I WANT TO SAY.
00:24:48.321,00:24:50.656,THAT'S WORTH MORE THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD OFFER.
00:24:50.739,00:24:57.455,"LISTEN, I KNOW WE HAVE DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES, BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING."
00:24:57.537,00:25:00.291,WE SHOULDN'T BE FIGHTING EACH OTHER.
00:25:00.374,00:25:03.127,DO YOU FEEL THAT? THE KICKING?
00:25:03.210,00:25:07.340,I WON'T LET PEOPLE LIKE YOU FUCK UP THE WORLD MY CHILD HAS TO LIVE IN.
00:25:07.423,00:25:12.219,IF I HAVE TO TELL A FEW LIES TO DO THAT-- AT LEAST I LEARNED ONE VALUABLE THING FROM YOU.
00:25:33.032,00:25:36.618,"- WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU? - GLENLIVET, NEAT."
00:25:59.766,00:26:02.436,AND OTHER THINGS.
00:26:02.520,00:26:03.937,WHAT OTHER THINGS?
00:26:08.275,00:26:12.738,"YOU KNOW, I CANNOT GUARANTEE YOU THAT ALL OF THIS IS GONNA SUCCEED."
00:26:12.821,00:26:14.781,"OH, IT'S NOT THAT."
00:26:19.370,00:26:21.705,"YOU CAN TELL ME, OR I CAN KEEP GUESSING."
00:26:22.956,00:26:25.167,YOU'LL ROLL YOUR EYES.
00:26:25.251,00:26:27.627,NOT AT YOU.
00:26:27.711,00:26:31.673,I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHEN ONE OF US DIES.
00:26:31.757,00:26:37.846,"WHETHER IT'S YOU FIRST OR ME-- WELL, IF IT IS ME, AND I'M SURE IT WILL BE, YOU WON'T BE ALONE FOR LONG."
00:26:37.930,00:26:41.683,"NO. I MEAN, WHAT WILL WE LEAVE BEHIND?"
00:26:41.767,00:26:43.936,WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED A GREAT DEAL.
00:26:44.019,00:26:46.313,AND I INTEND FOR US TO ACCOMPLISH A LOT MORE.
00:26:49.607,00:26:51.151,FOR EACH OTHER.
00:26:51.235,00:26:53.112,BUT IF WE'RE NOT...
00:26:57.908,00:26:59.826,"AH, I'M BEING SILLY."
00:27:05.999,00:27:08.335,HAVE YOU EVER BEEN PUBLISHED?
00:27:08.419,00:27:10.879,MANY TIMES.
00:27:10.963,00:27:12.881,I GUESS THAT'S A STUPID QUESTION.
00:27:20.973,00:27:23.142,YOU HAVE A NICE LAUGH.
00:27:24.893,00:27:26.437,REALLY?
00:27:26.520,00:27:28.564,IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE.
00:27:29.815,00:27:32.109,ARE YOU STAYING AT THE HOTEL?
00:27:32.192,00:27:35.028,YOU WANT TO COME UP TO MY ROOM?
00:27:35.112,00:27:37.448,THAT DEPENDS.
00:27:39.992,00:27:42.328,"WELL, HOW MUCH WOULD THAT COST ME?"
00:27:43.954,00:27:46.081,THAT SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT.
00:27:47.541,00:27:49.376,CLOSE YOUR EYES.
00:27:51.044,00:27:53.297,PUT OUT YOUR HANDS.
00:27:57.176,00:27:59.011,NOW OPEN THEM UP.
00:28:00.638,00:28:02.680,I'M TRYING TO FIND THIS WOMAN.
00:28:02.764,00:28:07.520,"IF YOU MAKE ME PULL OUT MY BADGE, I HAVE TO TAKE YOU IN."
00:28:07.603,00:28:09.438,BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
00:28:24.203,00:28:26.788,I USED TO SEE HER AROUND.
00:28:26.872,00:28:29.291,"SHE LEFT THE BUSINESS, THOUGH. WE HAVEN'T REALLY KEPT IN TOUCH."
00:28:29.375,00:28:31.293,ANY IDEA WHERE SHE MIGHT BE?
00:28:31.377,00:28:37.132,A FRIEND OF MINE SAW HER WAITING TABLES AT A RESTAURANT IN GEORGETOWN.
00:28:39.635,00:28:42.555,"I GUESS THE QUESTION I'M TRYING TO ASK IS, UM..."
00:28:51.063,00:28:52.856,HAVE YOU EVER HAD A MISCARRIAGE?
00:28:59.821,00:29:02.408,HAVE YOU HAD ANY ABORTIONS?
00:29:04.076,00:29:05.494,THREE.
00:29:06.912,00:29:10.123,THAT CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT.
00:29:10.207,00:29:16.796,"I'M NOT TRYING TO DISSUADE YOU, BUT PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE YOU DECIDE."
00:29:16.880,00:29:18.965,BUT IT'S POSSIBLE?
00:29:19.049,00:29:21.635,ASSUMING YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND FIT ALL THE CRITERIA?
00:29:21.719,00:29:23.762,"YES, IT'S POSSIBLE."
00:29:26.181,00:29:28.392,OKAY.
00:29:34.565,00:29:36.858,I HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK. WHAT IS IT?
00:29:36.942,00:29:39.111,SANCORP'S STOCK.
00:29:39.194,00:29:42.698,IT'S UP 35% IN THE LAST FOUR HOURS.
00:29:44.241,00:29:46.410,IT'S ALL OVER THE FINANCIAL NEWS.
00:29:48.704,00:29:50.956,TUSK IS MAKING A PLAY.
00:29:51.039,00:29:53.208,GET REMY ON THE PHONE.
00:29:55.502,00:29:58.255,CONGRESSMAN UNDERWOOD ON LINE THREE.
00:29:58.338,00:30:00.257,I WAS JUST ABOUT TO CALL YOU.
00:30:00.340,00:30:03.427,I NEED TO MEET WITH TUSK BEFORE HE SEES THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT.
00:30:03.510,00:30:05.804,- HE'S ALREADY HERE. - AT THE WHITE HOUSE?
00:30:07.889,00:30:09.475,HIS PLANE LANDED HALF AN HOUR AGO.
00:30:09.558,00:30:11.393,- DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS? - I DON'T KNOW.
00:30:11.477,00:30:13.604,HE HAD HIS OWN CAR PICK HIM UP. I JUST FOUND OUT.
00:30:16.189,00:30:19.359,"- LOOK, YOU NEED TO CALL ME THE MOMENT YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS. - OKAY."
00:30:19.443,00:30:21.779,IT'S JUST THE LUNCH MENU RIGHT NOW. I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.
00:30:21.861,00:30:23.947,YEAH. THAT'S FINE.
00:30:28.118,00:30:29.828,IS RACHEL WORKING?
00:30:29.911,00:30:32.080,"UH, NO. I DON'T THINK SHE'S SCHEDULED TILL SUNDAY."
00:30:32.164,00:30:33.832,STEPHANIE WILL BE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON.
00:30:33.915,00:30:35.208,THANKS.
00:30:37.836,00:30:40.046,SHOULD WE COME BACK SUNDAY?
00:31:16.458,00:31:19.878,EXCUSE ME. CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?
00:31:19.961,00:31:22.964,YEAH. I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR THE BATHROOM.
00:31:27.927,00:31:31.223,UNLESS YOU WANT TO USE THE RESTROOM IN THE OFFICE.
00:31:55.288,00:31:58.083,- WHO ARE YOU CALLING? - RACHEL.
00:32:04.798,00:32:06.425,RACHEL POSNER?
00:32:08.218,00:32:10.512,I'M A REPORTER AT SLUGLINE.COM.
00:32:10.596,00:32:12.848,I KNOW ABOUT PETER RUSSO.
00:32:14.850,00:32:17.561,RACHEL?
00:32:34.787,00:32:36.288,"COME ON, RACHEL."
00:32:38.457,00:32:40.417,YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE MENTIONED RUSSO.
00:32:40.500,00:32:43.086,- SHE'LL WRITE BACK. - I WOULDN'T IF I WAS HER.
00:33:31.718,00:33:34.847,- HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW? - THAT YOU WERE WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS PULLED OVER.
00:33:34.930,00:33:36.682,- WHO ELSE KNOWS? - JUST ME.
00:33:36.765,00:33:38.851,"I CAN KEEP IT THAT WAY, BUT I NEED MORE."
00:33:38.934,00:33:41.394,- THERE IS NO MORE. - YOU'RE LYING.
00:33:44.105,00:33:46.149,"YEAH, I WAS WITH HIM WHEN HE GOT PULLED OVER."
00:33:46.232,00:33:48.234,THEY TOOK HIM AWAY AND LET ME GO.
00:33:48.318,00:33:49.653,I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.
00:33:49.736,00:33:51.029,HE WAS NEVER CHARGED.
00:33:51.112,00:33:53.448,"YOU KNOW MORE THAN ME, THEN."
00:33:53.532,00:33:55.784,NO ONE EVER CAME TO TALK TO YOU?
00:33:57.953,00:34:00.747,YOU DON'T KISS AND TELL IN THAT BUSINESS.
00:34:00.831,00:34:02.165,NOT EVEN WHEN IT'S A CONGRESSMAN?
00:34:02.248,00:34:03.750,ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S A CONGRESSMAN.
00:34:05.711,00:34:07.546,FRANK UNDERWOOD NEVER APPROACHED YOU?
00:34:09.172,00:34:10.716,WHO'S THAT?
00:34:10.799,00:34:13.092,"YOU'RE TOO SMART TO PLAY DUMB, RACHEL."
00:34:13.176,00:34:14.720,YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS.
00:34:18.264,00:34:20.475,I TRY NOT TO FOLLOW THE NEWS.
00:34:20.559,00:34:22.686,TOO MANY FAMILIAR FACES.
00:34:23.896,00:34:25.480,HOW ABOUT DOUGLAS STAMPER?
00:34:25.564,00:34:28.567,NEVER HEARD OF HIM.
00:34:28.650,00:34:30.861,I'VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW.
00:34:33.238,00:34:35.323,I KNOW ABOUT WHAT YOUR FATHER DID.
00:34:35.407,00:34:38.577,"IF YOU DON'T HELP ME, I'LL WRITE ABOUT RUSSO."
00:34:38.660,00:34:44.249,"I'LL WRITE THAT YOU WERE A PROSTITUTE, AND I'LL WRITE ABOUT WHY YOU LEFT HOME."
00:35:08.481,00:35:10.400,SO?
00:35:13.111,00:35:15.488,- WHAT EXACTLY? - SHE DIDN'T SAY.
00:35:15.572,00:35:18.951,ALL SHE SEEMED TO KNOW WAS THAT I WAS IN THE CAR WITH HIM WHEN HE GOT PULLED OVER.
00:35:19.034,00:35:21.453,AND YOU DIDN'T ADMIT TO MORE THAN THAT?
00:35:21.536,00:35:23.496,NO. I SAID EVERYTHING EXACTLY LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO.
00:35:23.580,00:35:25.999,- YOU REALLY THINK I'D SPILL MY GUTS? - CALM DOWN.
00:35:26.083,00:35:28.543,WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME HE WAS GONNA HURT HIMSELF? I NEVER WOULD'VE DONE IT.
00:35:28.627,00:35:30.670,HOW COULD I HAVE KNOWN?
00:35:30.754,00:35:33.548,- I JUST WANT ALL THIS TO GO AWAY. - IT WILL.
00:35:33.632,00:35:35.968,ALL OF IT.
00:35:36.051,00:35:38.261,I PROMISE.
00:35:56.863,00:35:58.615,DO YOU WANT ME TO ORDER YOU DINNER?
00:35:58.698,00:36:01.200,- WHERE'S DOUG AT? - I DON'T KNOW. HE LEFT EARLY.
00:36:01.284,00:36:04.704,"- CALL HIM FOR ME, WILL YOU? - YES, SIR."
00:36:05.872,00:36:11.252,"THIRTEEN MINUTES FROM NOW, TUSK WILL MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT, IF HE ISN'T THERE ALREADY."
00:36:14.047,00:36:16.800,"PRESSING ON WITH YOUR SLOW, INCESSANT MARCH."
00:36:18.551,00:36:23.932,"TIME WOULD'VE KILLED RUSSO IF I HADN'T, JUST AS IT WILL KILL ME SOMEDAY."
00:36:24.016,00:36:25.767,KILL US ALL.
00:36:25.851,00:36:27.936,"SIR, I JUST GOT DOUG'S VOICEMAIL."
00:36:29.104,00:36:30.438,I WONDER WHERE HE'S AT.
00:36:31.606,00:36:33.608,"WELL, MAYBE THIS IS HIM."
00:36:36.653,00:36:37.779,FREDDY?
00:36:53.628,00:36:55.755,"SORRY, FRANK. I HAD TO TRADE UP."
00:36:55.839,00:36:59.300,"SANCORP'S A BIG FISH, BUT RAYMOND TUSK IS A WHALE."
00:37:15.108,00:37:17.027,"CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING, FRANK?"
00:37:19.320,00:37:21.614,I'LL LEAVE Y'ALL TO IT.
00:37:25.284,00:37:29.455,I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND THAT REMY TOLD ME ABOUT THIS LITTLE SECRET OF YOURS.
00:37:29.539,00:37:32.751,I WANTED A PLACE WHERE YOU'D FEEL COMFORTABLE.
00:37:36.254,00:37:38.590,SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT THE WHITE HOUSE?
00:37:38.673,00:37:43.178,HOW COULD I PASS UP THE CHANCE TO EAT THE BEST RIBS IN WASHINGTON?
00:37:43.261,00:37:44.971,MM-MM-MM.
00:37:45.055,00:37:47.640,REMY TOLD YOU ABOUT SANCORP.
00:37:47.724,00:37:52.104,"AS OF CLOSING BELL TODAY, I OWN 3%."
00:37:52.187,00:37:56.108,"BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK, I'LL OWN OVER TEN."
00:37:56.191,00:37:59.318,ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN'T CAUSE ME ANY TROUBLE.
00:37:59.402,00:38:02.363,"A VALIANT EFFORT, THOUGH. I RESPECT THAT."
00:38:04.241,00:38:06.618,SO WHY ARE WE HERE?
00:38:06.701,00:38:09.370,I TOLD YOU I'D GIVE YOU UNTIL TODAY TO THINK THINGS OVER.
00:38:09.454,00:38:12.290,- I'M A MAN WHO KEEPS MY WORD. - AND I'M STILL NOT INTERESTED.
00:38:14.333,00:38:17.336,YOU WANTED ME TO BE MORE SPECIFIC BACK IN ST. LOUIS.
00:38:17.420,00:38:18.797,THAT WOULD BE A GOOD START.
00:38:27.847,00:38:31.559,WHY DID BRITAIN GO TO WAR WITH CHINA 150 YEARS AGO?
00:38:31.643,00:38:33.186,I'M IN NO MOOD FOR RIDDLES.
00:38:36.606,00:38:39.484,"- OPIUM. - IT WAS BIGGER THAN OPIUM, FRANK."
00:38:41.820,00:38:44.614,PEKING WANTED TO CALL THE SHOTS INSTEAD OF THE WEST.
00:38:44.697,00:38:47.117,IT'S THE SAME PROBLEM WE'RE FACING NOW.
00:38:47.200,00:38:51.997,"BUT NOBODY WANTS A TRADE WAR, MUCH LESS A MILITARY ONE."
00:38:52.080,00:38:54.666,AND WHAT'S YOUR OPIUM?
00:38:54.749,00:38:58.461,SAMARIUM-149. I NEED IT FOR MY REACTORS.
00:38:58.544,00:39:02.674,CHINA CONTROLS 95% OF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY.
00:39:02.757,00:39:09.097,"AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE IMBALANCE IN OUR CURRENCY, OUR FOREIGN DEBT-- - ALL OF IT. - YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PRESIDENT'S EAR."
00:39:09.181,00:39:11.099,TRADE TARIFFS ARE CONTROLLED BY CONGRESS.
00:39:11.183,00:39:14.102,YOU HAVE A LOT MORE INFLUENCE THERE THAN GARRETT DOES.
00:39:14.186,00:39:16.437,IT'S THE REASON I WANTED YOU TO STAY THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
00:39:16.521,00:39:19.232,AND WHAT EXACTLY WOULD YOU WANT ME TO DO?
00:39:19.316,00:39:21.442,"WELL, THAT PART I DON'T KNOW YET."
00:39:21.526,00:39:24.112,WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW THINGS PLAY OUT WITH THE CHINESE.
00:39:24.196,00:39:27.115,I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU I WILL NOT DO A BLANK CHECK.
00:39:30.118,00:39:32.329,"I MUST SAY, I'M SURPRISED, FRANK."
00:39:32.411,00:39:34.789,YOU HAVE A REPUTATION FOR PRAGMATISM.
00:39:34.873,00:39:38.376,AND I ALSO HAVE AVOIDED A REPUTATION FOR INDENTURED SERVITUDE.
00:39:38.459,00:39:42.130,"I NEVER MAKE AN OFFER MORE THAN TWICE, FRANK."
00:39:42.214,00:39:44.757,TELL ME NOW IF I CAN COUNT ON YOUR COOPERATION.
00:39:44.841,00:39:47.844,"YOU'RE NOT OFFERING COOPERATION, YOU'RE DEMANDING TUTELAGE."
00:39:49.762,00:39:52.224,SO LET ME MAKE YOU A PROPOSAL.
00:39:52.307,00:39:57.645,I AM ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER AS EQUALS.
00:40:01.233,00:40:04.110,BUT I WILL NOT BIND MYSELF TO THEM IN ADVANCE.
00:40:04.194,00:40:06.363,"IF THAT DOESN'T INTEREST YOU, FAIR ENOUGH."
00:40:12.327,00:40:14.620,"YOU CAN'T PURCHASE LOYALTY, RAYMOND."
00:40:14.704,00:40:16.373,NOT THE SORT I HAVE IN MIND.
00:40:16.455,00:40:21.586,"IF YOU WANT TO EARN MY LOYALTY, THEN YOU HAVE TO OFFER YOURS IN RETURN."
00:40:21.669,00:40:24.839,AND IF WE CAN AGREE TO THAT...
00:40:24.923,00:40:29.468,"WELL, YOU'RE A MAN WITH IMAGINATION."
00:40:37.185,00:40:39.187,WAIT.
00:40:51.449,00:40:57.414,"IF STAMPER WAS THERE HIMSELF, THIS GOES MUCH DEEPER THAN A LOST ARREST FILE."
00:40:59.665,00:41:04.129,"WELL, LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS. WHAT DID RUSSO GAIN HIM?"
00:41:04.212,00:41:05.755,A MANSION IN HARRISBURG.
00:41:10.009,00:41:12.762,- THEN WHAT? - I DON'T KNOW.
00:41:12.845,00:41:14.431,HE CONTROLS PENNSYLVANIA.
00:41:14.513,00:41:15.723,HE HAS INFLUENCE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
00:41:15.807,00:41:26.025,WALKER NEEDS THE STATE FOR REELECTION-- THE PRESIDENT BACKSTABBED HIM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE NOMINATION.
00:41:26.109,00:41:28.320,IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE.
00:41:30.947,00:41:32.740,THE PRESIDENT WOULD OWE HIM.
00:41:32.824,00:41:34.451,BUT WHAT?
00:41:34.533,00:41:35.743,THEY ALREADY MEET ONCE A WEEK.
00:41:35.827,00:41:37.495,"THE EDUCATION BILL? I MEAN, WHAT?"
