00:00:40.834,00:00:42.875,Oh.
00:01:33.208,00:01:35.625,Montauk train on Track B.
00:01:35.667,00:01:39.917,"Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004."
00:01:41.917,00:01:44.250,Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies...
00:01:45.792,00:01:47.875,to make people feel like crap.
00:01:51.792,00:01:53.625,I ditched work today.
00:01:56.166,00:01:58.208,Took a train out to Montauk.
00:02:00.500,00:02:01.500,I don't know why.
00:02:02.959,00:02:04.000,Aah!
00:02:04.041,00:02:06.375,I'm not an impulsive person.
00:02:13.959,00:02:17.458,I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.
00:02:17.500,00:02:19.875,I gotta get my car fixed.
00:02:19.917,00:02:21.208,Hi. Cindy?
00:02:21.250,00:02:23.166,It's Joel.
00:02:23.208,00:02:24.542,Joel!
00:02:24.583,00:02:27.959,"Listen, I don't feel very well today."
00:02:28.000,00:02:30.417,"No, food poisoning, I think."
00:02:30.458,00:02:33.959,It's goddamn freezing on this beach.
00:02:34.000,00:02:37.041,Montauk in February.
00:02:39.083,00:02:40.875,Page is ripped out.
00:02:40.917,00:02:42.834,Don't remember doing that.
00:02:45.417,00:02:48.542,It appears this is my first entry in two years.
00:02:57.583,00:02:58.917,Sand is overrated.
00:03:00.417,00:03:02.875,It's just tiny little rocks.
00:03:12.709,00:03:14.375,If only I could meet someone new.
00:03:16.083,00:03:23.583,"I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished, seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know."
00:03:24.750,00:03:27.959,Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
00:03:28.000,00:03:30.083,She was nice.
00:03:30.125,00:03:31.750,Nice is good.
00:03:33.583,00:03:35.792,She loved me.
00:03:39.000,00:03:53.792,David-- Hi. How are you?
00:04:12.667,00:04:15.583,Why do I fall in love with every woman I see...
00:04:15.625,00:04:17.959,who shows me the least bit of attention?
00:04:59.792,00:05:00.792,Hi.
00:05:01.625,00:05:04.417,- I'm sorry?
00:05:04.458,00:05:06.000,Hi. Hello. Hi.
00:05:07.375,00:05:08.875,Okay if I sit closer?
00:05:11.959,00:05:15.458,How far are you going?
00:05:15.500,00:05:17.750,Get out! Me too.
00:05:17.792,00:05:20.625,Really?
00:05:22.917,00:05:24.875,Do I know you?
00:05:28.000,00:05:29.583,Do you ever shop at Barnes &amp; Noble?
00:05:29.625,00:05:31.875,Sure. Hmm.
00:05:31.917,00:05:34.375,Yeah?
00:05:34.417,00:05:38.709,"Book slave there for, like, five years now."
00:05:38.750,00:05:41.500,Ah. I would have thought I would've remembered you.
00:05:41.542,00:05:44.166,Is it five years?
00:05:44.208,00:05:46.417,What might?
00:05:46.458,00:05:49.917,The color.
00:05:49.959,00:05:51.834,It's called Blue Ruin.
00:05:51.875,00:05:53.125,The color.
00:05:53.166,00:05:55.709,"Snappy name, huh?"
00:05:55.750,00:05:56.750,Yeah.
00:05:58.583,00:06:02.166,"Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names."
00:06:02.208,00:06:06.917,"Red-- Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution."
00:06:06.959,00:06:09.333,"That'd be a job, coming up with those names."
00:06:09.375,00:06:12.166,You think there could possibly be a job like that?
00:06:12.208,00:06:14.959,"I mean, how many hair colors could there be?"
00:06:15.000,00:06:17.709,"- Fifty, maybe."
00:06:19.291,00:06:21.834,Agent Orange!
00:06:23.125,00:06:25.834,I apply my personality in a paste.
00:06:25.875,00:06:27.750,"Oh, I doubt that very much."
00:06:29.041,00:06:30.875,"Well, you don't know me, so..."
00:06:31.834,00:06:33.375,"you don't know, do you?"
00:06:36.709,00:06:39.750,Sorry. I was just-- I'm trying to be nice.
00:06:41.667,00:06:43.542,Yeah. Yeah. I got it.
00:07:03.333,00:07:05.583,"My name is Clementine, by the way."
00:07:05.625,00:07:07.625,I'm Joel.
00:07:07.667,00:07:09.625,Hey.
00:07:09.667,00:07:11.417,No jokes about my name.
00:07:11.458,00:07:14.417,"Oh, no, you wouldn't do that."
00:07:16.166,00:07:18.458,I don't know any jokes about your name.
00:07:18.500,00:07:21.542,Huckleberry Hound.
00:07:21.583,00:07:23.542,I don't know what that means.
00:07:23.583,00:07:26.458,Huckleberry Hound?
00:07:26.500,00:07:28.667,It's been suggested.
00:07:36.750,00:07:38.458,No?
00:07:38.500,00:07:42.709,I'm sorry. Just-- It's a pretty name though.
00:07:42.750,00:07:44.834,"It's, uh-- It means merciful."
00:07:44.875,00:07:46.500,Right? Clemency?
00:07:47.458,00:07:49.125,Although it hardly fits.
00:07:49.166,00:07:51.333,"I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told."
00:07:51.375,00:07:53.959,"Gee, I-I wouldn't think that about you."
00:07:54.000,00:07:55.750,Why wouldn't you think that about me?
00:07:55.792,00:07:57.667,I don't know.
00:07:55.792,00:08:01.959,I just-- I don't know.
00:07:59.667,00:08:06.625,"I just, uh-- You seem nice, so-- Oh, now I'm nice?"
00:08:06.667,00:08:09.166,"Oh, God. Don't you know any other adjectives?"
00:08:09.208,00:08:11.041,I don't need nice.
00:08:11.083,00:08:14.041,"I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me."
00:08:14.083,00:08:15.041,Okay.
00:08:18.625,00:08:20.000,Joel?
00:08:21.166,00:08:23.750,"It's Joel, right?"
00:08:23.792,00:08:25.792,Yes.
00:08:26.417,00:08:29.083,I'm sorry I yelled at you.
00:08:29.125,00:08:31.250,I'm a little out of sorts today.
00:08:41.250,00:08:45.291,"My embarrassing admission is, I really like that you're nice right now."
00:08:45.333,00:08:52.041,"I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like, but right now..."
00:08:53.500,00:08:55.500,I'm glad you are.
00:09:03.083,00:09:11.667,"I have some stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh-- Oh! I'm sorry. Okay."
00:09:09.250,00:09:13.458,"I-I'm writing, and-- No, no. I just-- Sure. No. That's okay."
00:09:13.500,00:09:16.667,"I just have-- You know, this is-- Okay."
00:09:16.709,00:09:18.458,- Oh! Hey!
00:09:18.500,00:09:20.458,Jesus!
00:09:33.583,00:09:37.750,"Hi. I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need."
00:09:39.208,00:09:40.750,It's cold.
00:09:40.792,00:09:42.208,Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
00:09:42.250,00:09:43.917,It is frosty.
00:09:43.959,00:09:46.750,"You're not a stalker or anything, right?"
00:09:46.792,00:09:48.417,You're the one that talked to me.
00:09:48.458,00:09:50.750,That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
00:09:50.792,00:09:53.834,Really?
00:09:53.875,00:09:56.125,Mm-hmm.
00:09:56.166,00:09:57.959,I gotta read that one.
00:10:02.917,00:10:06.458,"Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso."
00:10:06.500,00:10:07.625,"I'm not, really."
00:10:07.667,00:10:10.875,"Oh, it's okay."
00:10:17.333,00:10:19.834,Do you wanna have a drink?
00:10:19.875,00:10:25.959,"I have lots of drinks, and I could, um-- Um-- Never mind."
00:10:26.000,00:10:28.583,Sorry. That was stupid.
00:10:28.625,00:10:30.208,"Good night, Joel."
00:10:49.917,00:10:51.583,Two Blue Ruins.
00:10:53.291,00:10:54.709,Thank you.
00:10:54.750,00:10:57.333,"Drink up, young man."
00:10:57.375,00:10:59.542,It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
00:11:03.500,00:11:04.917,I'm just kidding!
00:11:04.959,00:11:06.500,Come on.
00:11:13.208,00:11:14.917,"You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you?"
00:11:14.959,00:11:17.250,I'm sorry.
00:11:17.291,00:11:21.417,"It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting."
00:11:22.667,00:11:24.917,"I go to work, I come home."
00:11:26.500,00:11:29.083,Don't know what to say.
00:11:29.125,00:11:31.875,You should read my journal.
00:11:29.125,00:11:35.542,"Uh, there's-- I mean, it's just... blank."
00:11:35.583,00:11:39.000,Really?
00:11:39.041,00:11:48.083,"I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, taking advantage of every possibility, making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have."
00:11:48.125,00:11:50.458,I think about that.
00:11:55.125,00:11:57.041,You're really nice.
00:11:57.083,00:12:00.667,Oh!
00:12:02.250,00:12:04.166,I'm gonna marry you.
00:12:04.208,00:12:06.458,I know it.
00:12:06.500,00:12:08.125,Um... okay.
00:12:13.583,00:12:18.000,"Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime."
00:12:18.041,00:12:20.291,It gets frozen this time of year.
00:12:20.333,00:12:22.000,That sounds scary.
00:12:23.208,00:12:25.083,I'll pack a picnic.
00:12:25.125,00:12:28.250,A night picnic.
00:12:28.291,00:12:31.875,"And, um, we could-- Sounds good."
00:12:33.250,00:12:35.709,"But I-- I should, uh, go."
00:12:36.917,00:12:38.959,You should stay.
00:12:36.917,00:12:42.083,"No, I really-- I'm-- I-- I have to get up so early."
00:12:42.125,00:12:43.959,I would like you to call me.
00:12:44.000,00:12:46.917,Would you do that?
00:12:46.959,00:12:48.333,Yes.
00:12:52.458,00:12:55.291,Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call!
00:12:55.333,00:12:56.917,That'd be nice.
00:13:38.208,00:13:40.000,What took you so long?
00:13:40.041,00:13:41.667,I just walked in.
00:13:41.709,00:13:44.709,Mm-hmm. You miss me?
00:13:44.750,00:13:47.000,Yeah.
00:13:47.041,00:13:48.875,Oh!
00:13:48.917,00:13:51.542,You said I do.
00:13:51.583,00:13:53.667,I guess so.
00:13:53.709,00:13:56.500,Tomorrow night?
00:13:56.542,00:13:58.959,It's really solid this time of year.
00:13:59.000,00:14:00.917,Whoa! I don't know.
00:14:00.959,00:14:02.792,Come on.
00:14:02.834,00:14:05.166,Come on.
00:14:05.208,00:14:08.458,Whew.
00:14:08.500,00:14:11.917,Oh. So beautiful.
00:14:13.458,00:14:15.166,Isn't it?
00:14:18.208,00:14:20.000,"Uh, don't go too far."
00:14:20.041,00:14:23.041,- Whoo! Ow! Ow!
00:14:23.083,00:14:26.041,- Are you okay?
00:14:27.291,00:14:30.500,"Oh! Oh, my ass!"
00:14:32.291,00:14:35.291,I think I should go back.
00:14:35.333,00:14:37.000,What if it breaks?
00:14:37.041,00:14:38.917,What if? Do you really care right now?
00:14:38.959,00:14:42.333,Huh?
00:14:42.375,00:14:44.000,Come on.
00:14:47.458,00:14:49.917,Ohh.
00:14:49.959,00:14:53.000,Slidey-slidey.
00:14:53.041,00:14:55.834,This is good.
00:14:55.875,00:14:58.250,What are you doing?
00:15:00.542,00:15:02.000,Come on.
00:15:07.583,00:15:09.625,Think I heard a crack.
00:15:09.667,00:15:15.083,It's not gonna crack or break or-- It's so thick.
00:15:16.917,00:15:19.417,Show me which constellations you know.
00:15:19.458,00:15:22.333,Um-- Oh.
00:15:22.375,00:15:24.542,I don't... know any.
00:15:26.208,00:15:28.458,Show me which ones you know.
00:15:28.500,00:15:29.875,Okay.
00:15:31.125,00:15:32.500,Okay.
00:15:33.750,00:15:37.208,Oh. Here's Osidius.
00:15:37.250,00:15:39.083,Where?
00:15:39.125,00:15:41.083,Right there.
00:15:41.125,00:15:44.083,It's sort of a swoop and a cross.
00:15:44.125,00:15:45.625,Osidius the Emphatic.
00:15:47.875,00:15:50.375,You're full of shit.
00:15:50.417,00:15:53.542,Osidius is right there.
00:15:53.583,00:15:56.417,Shut the fuck up!
00:16:08.208,00:16:09.667,Clementine.
00:16:09.709,00:16:11.917,Cock-a-doodle-doo.
00:16:14.709,00:16:16.750,Hey.
00:16:16.792,00:16:19.917,Hey.
00:16:21.583,00:16:23.917,Ah.
00:16:29.125,00:16:32.500,Can I come over to your house...
00:16:32.542,00:16:34.542,to sleep?
00:16:34.583,00:16:37.542,I'm so tired.
00:16:37.583,00:16:40.375,"Okay. Um, yeah. Sure."
00:16:40.417,00:16:44.291,Let me get my toothbrush.
00:16:44.333,00:17:07.291,You-- Just-- Yes?
00:17:07.333,00:17:10.542,Can I help you?
00:17:11.959,00:17:13.917,Can I help you with something?
00:17:15.166,00:17:17.291,No.
00:17:17.333,00:17:19.041,What are you doing here?
00:17:19.083,00:17:21.750,I'm not really sure what you're asking me.
00:17:22.625,00:17:24.583,Oh.
00:17:24.625,00:17:26.041,Thanks.
00:19:14.583,00:19:17.959,We're looking for 159.
00:19:18.000,00:19:19.917,I don't know where that is.
00:19:19.959,00:19:24.959,"Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light the number, or at least put a number on-- Is that him?"
00:19:25.000,00:19:27.917,"Yeah, that's him."
00:19:43.125,00:19:45.208,"Hey, Joel."
00:19:48.166,00:19:50.500,"Oh, shit."
00:19:50.542,00:19:54.750,Jesus. The only Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.
00:19:54.792,00:19:57.083,"How pathetic is that, huh?"
00:19:57.125,00:20:00.667,"You're lucky you have Clementine, man."
00:20:00.709,00:20:02.875,"Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?"
00:20:07.125,00:20:08.875,No.
00:20:08.917,00:20:11.500,"Well, it's only a day away."
00:20:11.542,00:20:13.667,Don't want to end up at Mickey D's. Right?
00:20:13.709,00:20:15.500,McRomance!
00:20:15.542,00:20:16.917,You want some fries with that shake?
00:20:16.959,00:20:20.041,"I-I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank."
00:20:21.542,00:20:22.375,It's 8:30.
00:20:50.500,00:20:52.959,"Patrick, stop it."
00:21:10.458,00:21:12.375,Oh! Okay.
00:21:12.417,00:21:16.542,Okay. Okay.
00:21:16.583,00:21:18.041,Okay.
00:21:20.417,00:21:22.250,Showtime at the Apollo.
00:21:31.750,00:21:34.625,"Shh, shh, shh. Hey."
00:21:34.667,00:21:36.208,Quiet.
00:21:45.333,00:21:46.917,Get it off your head.
00:21:49.500,00:21:51.750,"Hey, Joel. What's up?"
00:21:51.792,00:21:53.458,"Oh. Hi, Frank."
00:21:59.333,00:22:03.083,I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.
00:22:03.125,00:22:05.583,How pathetic is that?
00:22:05.625,00:22:08.125,"You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel."
00:22:08.166,00:22:12.834,"Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine's Day plans with her?"
00:22:12.875,00:22:14.583,No.
00:22:14.625,00:22:16.333,It's only a day away.
00:22:16.375,00:22:18.667,Better make a reservation or something.
00:22:18.709,00:22:20.959,Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.
00:22:21.000,00:22:23.041,"Oh, no!"
00:22:23.083,00:22:27.542,is three goddamn days away!
00:22:27.583,00:22:29.500,I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.
00:22:29.542,00:22:32.959,"So I call her, and she's changed her number."
00:22:33.000,00:22:36.166,"So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something."
00:22:36.208,00:22:43.834,"I thought I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and-- You won't believe it."
00:22:43.875,00:22:46.542,She's there with...
00:22:46.583,00:22:50.542,"this guy, this really young guy."
00:22:50.583,00:22:54.333,And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
00:22:54.375,00:22:56.417,Excuse me?
00:22:56.458,00:22:58.875,"Can I help you find something, sir?"
00:23:02.417,00:23:04.583,"Hey, Clem-ato."
00:23:04.709,00:23:07.959,Patrick! Baby boy.
00:23:10.959,00:23:13.375,"What you doing here, baby?"
00:23:13.417,00:23:17.291,"Let me know if you need something, sir."
00:23:17.333,00:23:19.625,How are you?
00:23:19.667,00:23:22.333,Pretty good. Pretty bored.
00:23:22.375,00:23:23.750,Uh-huh.
00:23:23.792,00:23:26.250,I so want what's in your suit.
00:23:36.917,00:23:38.291,Why?
00:23:39.834,00:23:41.583,Why would she do that to me?
00:23:46.083,00:23:48.166,"Hey, does anybody want a joint?"
00:23:48.208,00:23:51.250,"Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest."
00:23:51.291,00:23:53.542,"Oh, God."
00:23:53.583,00:23:54.917,"I know, honey."
00:23:54.959,00:23:57.333,It's horrible.
00:23:57.375,00:24:00.166,"No! No, no, no."
00:24:00.208,00:24:04.375,Get off. It's too-- Right.
00:24:04.417,00:24:06.333,I don't want to seem desperate.
00:24:06.375,00:24:11.333,"Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break. Right?"
00:24:11.375,00:24:14.291,Right?
00:24:16.250,00:24:18.917,"All right, Joel."
00:24:18.959,00:24:20.750,Rob!
00:24:20.792,00:24:23.834,Don't do that.
00:24:23.875,00:24:25.792,"What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?"
00:24:25.834,00:24:27.375,"What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?"
00:24:27.417,00:24:29.458,You're gonna make this about our shit now?
00:24:29.500,00:24:33.500,I agree. It's not about us.
00:24:33.542,00:24:35.917,Not Mama Carrie's kid.
00:24:37.667,00:24:40.083,- What are you-- - That's your laundry!
00:24:41.834,00:24:45.041,That's great.
00:24:56.083,00:24:57.041,Okay.
00:25:04.291,00:25:05.375,I don't know.
00:25:05.417,00:25:08.125,It's some place that does a thing.
00:25:20.667,00:25:22.125,Good morning. Lacuna.
00:25:23.583,00:25:27.417,"No, I'm sorry."
00:25:29.000,00:25:32.166,"Yeah, sure."
00:25:29.000,00:25:34.667,We can fit you in-- How about on the fifth?
00:25:34.709,00:25:36.583,That's a Wednesday.
00:25:36.625,00:25:39.208,"All right, great."
00:25:39.250,00:25:41.458,"Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number."
00:25:43.458,00:25:46.333,Great. Have a nice day.
00:25:46.375,00:25:48.125,May I help you?
00:25:48.166,00:25:51.458,I'm Joel Barish.
00:25:51.500,00:25:54.834,I'm Joel. Barish.
00:25:51.500,00:25:57.417,I have an appointment with Dr.-- Mierzwiak.
00:25:57.458,00:26:00.250,- Here. Could you please fill this out?
00:26:00.291,00:26:02.458,"You still need to fill the form out, sir."
00:26:02.500,00:26:06.291,- Thank you.
00:26:06.333,00:26:08.500,- I don't have a pen.
00:26:10.917,00:26:12.834,Good morning. Lacuna.
00:26:12.875,00:26:16.500,"Oh, yeah, that offer."
00:26:16.542,00:26:17.917,Mr. Barish?
00:26:21.125,00:26:22.834,How are we today?
00:26:22.875,00:26:24.834,"Not too good, actually."
00:26:24.875,00:26:27.333,Boo!
00:26:27.375,00:26:30.166,Sorry.
00:26:30.208,00:26:33.458,Sorry. Sorry.
00:26:33.500,00:26:36.291,"Here, Doctor."
00:26:36.333,00:26:38.291,You should not have seen this.
00:26:38.333,00:26:39.709,I apologize.
00:26:44.250,00:26:46.917,"This is a hoax, right?"
00:26:44.250,00:26:49.542,"I mean, this is Clem-- I assure you, no."
00:26:54.792,00:26:57.625,Mm-mmm. There's no such thing as this.
00:26:59.333,00:27:05.375,"Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence."
00:27:05.417,00:27:13.333,"Suffice it to say that Miss, uh-- Miss Kruczynski was not happy, and she wanted to move on."
00:27:13.375,00:27:15.417,We provide that possibility.
00:27:15.458,00:27:19.417,Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.
00:27:19.458,00:27:22.542,We provide that possibility.
00:27:22.583,00:27:24.417,What the hell is that?
00:27:24.458,00:27:26.792,Nicest guy she ever went out with.
00:27:26.834,00:27:29.333,Ow! Fuck!
00:27:29.375,00:27:31.875,"God, Rob! Give it a rest!"
00:27:31.917,00:27:33.333,It's okay.
00:27:33.375,00:27:36.041,"Carrie, I am making a birdhouse."
00:27:38.667,00:27:41.750,"What can I say, Joel?"
00:27:41.792,00:27:44.041,She's impulsive.
00:27:44.083,00:27:47.083,She decided to erase you almost as a lark.
00:27:51.417,00:27:53.417,A lark.
00:27:53.458,00:27:56.792,Why? Why? Why?
00:27:56.834,00:28:00.333,I love you!
00:28:00.375,00:28:01.917,"Wait, wait, wait, wait!"
00:28:01.959,00:28:04.041,"I'm sorry, Doctor."
00:28:04.083,00:28:07.750,Okay. I want it done.
00:28:07.792,00:28:11.542,"- Oh, th-th-that's-- that's okay, Mary."
00:28:11.583,00:28:14.458,"Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh-- to come inside."
00:28:14.500,00:28:16.500,"And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo."
00:28:16.542,00:28:17.917,"Good-bye, Mrs. Woo."
00:28:22.166,00:28:29.667,"Now, the, uh-- the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish, is to go home..."
00:28:29.709,00:28:32.208,and collect everything you own...
00:28:32.250,00:28:34.959,that has some association with Clementine.
00:28:35.792,00:28:37.583,Anything.
00:28:39.417,00:28:41.208,We'll use these items...
00:28:41.250,00:28:45.625,"to create a map of Clementine in your brain, okay?"
00:28:45.667,00:28:58.583,"So we'll need, uh-- uh, photos, clothing, gifts, books she may have bought you, CDs you may have bought together, journal entries."
00:28:58.625,00:29:04.834,We want to empty your home-- We want to empty your life of Clementine.
00:29:04.875,00:29:10.000,"And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight."
00:29:10.041,00:29:20.166,"That way, when you awake in the morning, you'll find yourself in your own bed, as if nothing had happened-- a new life awaiting you."
00:29:24.667,00:29:26.625,"Wake up, buddy!"
00:29:31.917,00:29:34.083,"No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel."
00:29:34.125,00:29:38.125,You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.
00:29:38.166,00:29:41.458,"Well, it's just not our policy-- How are you today, Mr. Barish?"
00:29:43.083,00:29:45.458,Hello. I'm right here.
00:29:45.500,00:29:49.917,"I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can-- We can fit you in on the first of March."
00:29:49.959,00:29:55.750,"Maybe you could talk to the doctor, a-and he-- All right, so let's make an appointment."
00:29:55.792,00:29:57.542,What day would you like to come in this week?
00:29:57.583,00:30:01.166,Mr. Barish.
00:30:01.208,00:30:06.125,Maybe tomorrow would be better.
00:30:06.166,00:30:09.333,February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.
00:30:16.166,00:30:21.041,"This is, uh, Stan Fink, one of our most experienced and skilled technicians."
00:30:22.583,00:30:24.792,He'll be handling your case tonight.
00:30:24.834,00:30:27.834,"Great to meet you, Mr. Barish."
00:30:27.875,00:30:34.625,"My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski."
00:30:34.667,00:30:39.083,Very good.
00:30:39.125,00:30:42.166,"Uh, I was..."
00:30:42.208,00:30:54.375,"living with this woman, Naomi, uh, a couple years ago, and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach-- I don't like parties."
00:30:54.417,00:30:57.458,"Naomi couldn't go, but I went..."
00:30:57.500,00:31:00.667,"and I, uh, met Clementine."
00:31:00.709,00:31:03.792,I'm sorry.
00:31:03.834,00:31:07.041,Let's start with your most recent memories...
00:31:07.083,00:31:10.667,"and work backwards from there, more or less."
00:31:10.709,00:31:19.041,"There's an emotional core to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core, it starts its degradation process."
00:31:19.083,00:31:27.250,"By the time you wake up in the morning, all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared, as in a dream upon waking."
00:31:27.291,00:31:29.875,Is there any risk of brain damage?
00:31:29.917,00:31:38.667,"Well, uh, technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking."
00:31:38.709,00:31:39.792,Nothing you'll miss.
00:31:41.667,00:31:44.041,Comfortable?
00:31:44.083,00:31:48.333,"What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain."
00:31:48.375,00:31:50.417,"Okay, let's get started."
00:31:50.458,00:31:54.166,"If we want to get this procedure under way tonight, we have some work to do."
00:31:54.208,00:31:58.709,"I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will."
00:32:01.375,00:32:06.583,"There's a good story behind this one-- Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout..."
00:32:06.625,00:32:10.500,if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.
00:32:10.542,00:32:12.333,Just please try to focus on the memories.
00:32:12.375,00:32:14.875,Oh. Sorry. Okay.
00:32:16.792,00:32:21.375,Healthy activity up there.
00:32:21.417,00:32:23.875,- Here's another object.
00:32:21.417,00:32:26.917,That's so-- Next item. Okay.
00:32:28.792,00:32:30.750,Potato head.
00:32:30.792,00:32:34.166,- Next item. Okay.
00:32:34.208,00:32:39.834,Just focus on the memories.
00:32:39.875,00:32:42.250,"do me a favor, will ya?"
00:32:42.291,00:32:44.709,"Can you, uh, check the voltage regulator?"
00:32:44.750,00:32:46.625,What do we got there?
00:32:46.667,00:32:48.750,"Uh, voltage looks fine."
00:32:48.792,00:32:52.125,"Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here."
00:32:55.500,00:33:00.166,"Well, uh, technically, the procedure is brain damage."
00:33:02.625,00:33:04.875,"Check the, uh-- Check the connections, please."
00:33:06.834,00:33:09.542,"Oh, there you are."
00:33:06.834,00:33:18.750,I-- Why am I-- I don't understand what I'm looking at.
00:33:18.792,00:33:24.750,"Why am I standing here and-- Oh, my God."
00:33:24.792,00:33:27.625,Déjà vu.
00:33:24.792,00:33:30.291,This is so-- We should get started.
00:33:27.667,00:33:33.125,"If we're gonna get the procedure-- under way tonight, we have some work to do."
00:33:33.166,00:33:35.458,"I'm in my head already, aren't I?"
00:33:35.500,00:33:39.125,I suppose so.
00:33:39.166,00:33:41.709,This is what it-- This is what it would look like.
00:33:44.417,00:33:46.333,Very good.
00:33:46.375,00:33:49.041,We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.
00:33:49.083,00:33:52.792,That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
00:33:52.834,00:33:54.500,"Ah, there we go."
00:33:54.542,00:33:56.125,Patrick?
00:33:56.166,00:33:58.750,"Patrick, can you check-- Patrick?"
00:33:58.792,00:34:02.417,I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice.
00:34:02.458,00:34:06.458,- Why are there so many wires?
00:34:06.500,00:34:10.291,- Does that help?
00:34:10.333,00:34:12.291,Mr. Barish?
00:34:12.333,00:34:14.500,"There we are, Mr. Barish."
00:34:14.542,00:34:17.542,- I don't know if I like this.
00:34:17.583,00:34:19.959,We're almost done now.
00:34:20.000,00:34:23.000,Mmm. Journal.
00:34:23.041,00:34:26.500,I met someone tonight.
00:34:26.542,00:34:29.709,I don't know what to do.
00:34:29.750,00:34:31.208,"- Whoa, whoa! Jesus!"
00:34:31.250,00:34:35.208,What? What?
00:34:35.250,00:34:37.291,Just take it easy.
00:34:37.333,00:34:39.208,That's fine.
00:34:39.250,00:34:41.917,Let's not roach the guy.
00:34:44.834,00:34:46.625,"All right, we got that one."
00:34:46.667,00:34:48.750,"This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?"
00:34:48.792,00:34:50.166,"It's an apartment, Patrick."
00:34:51.333,00:34:52.875,Patrick.
00:34:52.917,00:34:57.250,"Well, not a dump then, but sorta plain."
00:34:57.291,00:35:00.458,And there's sort of a stale smell.
00:35:00.500,00:35:04.041,"Patrick, can we just please get through this?"
00:35:04.083,00:35:08.250,We got a very long night ahead of us. Come on.
00:35:12.792,00:35:15.041,This is the last time I saw you.
00:35:31.083,00:35:32.750,It's 3:00.
00:35:32.792,00:35:37.250,I kinda sorta wrecked your car.
00:35:37.291,00:35:39.458,Were you driving drunk?
00:35:39.500,00:35:41.500,It's pathetic.
00:35:41.542,00:35:44.250,I was a little tipsy.
00:35:44.291,00:35:45.625,Don't call me pathetic.
00:35:45.667,00:35:48.917,"Well, it is pathetic."
00:35:48.959,00:35:50.875,Could've killed somebody.
00:35:50.917,00:35:53.083,Maybe you did kill somebody.
00:35:53.125,00:35:54.792,"Oh, Christ!"
00:35:54.834,00:35:57.583,Should I check the grill to see if there's children or small animals?
00:35:57.625,00:35:59.375,I didn't kill anybody!
00:35:59.417,00:36:03.542,- You're like an old lady or something.
00:36:03.583,00:36:05.667,A wino?
00:36:05.709,00:36:08.625,"Jesus, are you from the '50s or something?"
00:36:08.667,00:36:10.041,A wino?
00:36:11.417,00:36:13.083,"Face it, Joely."
00:36:13.125,00:36:24.375,"You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?"
00:36:26.000,00:36:30.875,"No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight."
00:36:30.917,00:36:32.875,Isn't that how you get people to like you?
00:36:42.917,00:36:46.500,I'm sorry. Okay?
00:36:46.542,00:36:49.291,"Clem, I didn't mean it."
00:36:55.000,00:36:56.041,Clem?
00:36:56.083,00:36:57.917,I was just-- I won't need them anymore.
00:36:57.959,00:37:03.083,"I was just-- angry or annoyed or something, I don't know."
00:37:10.417,00:37:11.792,Clem?
00:37:13.667,00:37:16.750,Got it.
00:37:16.792,00:37:18.792,Mary's coming over tonight.
00:37:18.834,00:37:20.083,Yeah?
00:37:20.125,00:37:21.750,Just thought you'd wanna know.
00:37:21.792,00:37:24.083,I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit.
00:37:24.125,00:37:28.166,- I just don't think she likes me.
00:37:28.208,00:37:32.000,"So, maybe I should invite my girlfriend over."
00:37:32.041,00:37:34.333,Do whatever you want.
00:37:32.041,00:37:35.750,Did I tell you I have-- Yeah.
00:37:41.000,00:37:43.250,Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
00:37:43.291,00:37:45.709,"We gotta focus here, Patrick."
00:37:45.750,00:37:51.291,"Yeah, the thing is, our situation is-- is a little weird."
00:37:51.333,00:37:53.000,My girlfriend situation.
00:37:53.417,00:37:55.917,I'm sure it is.
00:37:55.959,00:38:25.166,"You gotta be-- Clem, let me drive you home."
00:38:25.208,00:38:27.458,"Get out of my face, faggot!"
00:38:29.125,00:38:32.291,Look at it out here!
00:38:32.333,00:38:35.041,"I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!"
00:38:35.083,00:38:37.208,You did it to me first!
00:38:37.250,00:38:41.125,I can't believe you did this to me.
00:38:41.166,00:38:44.000,Clem! Can you hear me?
00:38:44.041,00:38:46.667,By morning you'll be gone!
00:38:46.709,00:38:49.959,The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!
00:38:55.458,00:38:58.041,Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me?
00:38:58.083,00:39:01.709,Is that a problem?
00:39:01.750,00:39:04.709,"So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?"
00:39:04.750,00:39:07.041,"Patrick, let's focus, buddy."
00:39:07.083,00:39:09.583,Remember that girl we did last week?
00:39:09.625,00:39:12.125,The one with the... potatoes?
00:39:14.542,00:39:18.500,That girl?
00:39:18.542,00:39:19.667,Right.
00:39:19.709,00:39:22.875,Was. We took care of that.
00:39:22.917,00:39:24.458,"Oh, come on!"
00:39:24.500,00:39:28.250,"Well, uh, I kinda fell in love with her that night."
00:39:28.291,00:39:34.375,What? You little fuck-- What?
00:39:34.417,00:39:41.166,"Well, she was beautiful, and-- I stole a pair of her panties as well."
00:39:43.542,00:39:45.375,Jesus!
00:39:45.417,00:39:47.667,"It's not like-- I mean, they were clean and all."
00:39:47.709,00:39:50.208,"Don't tell me this stuff, man!"
00:39:50.250,00:39:52.917,They were clean!
00:39:52.959,00:39:54.834,Okay. Yeah! All right!
00:39:54.875,00:39:56.041,Okay. Fine.
00:39:56.083,00:39:57.250,Give me my papers.
00:40:11.542,00:40:15.875,"There's, um-- There's more."
00:40:18.417,00:40:21.166,"After we did her, I kind of..."
00:40:21.208,00:40:23.959,went to where she works and asked her out.
00:40:25.875,00:40:27.375,You what?
00:40:27.417,00:40:31.583,Jesus.
00:40:31.625,00:40:34.417,Do you have... any idea...
00:40:34.458,00:40:38.542,how unethical-- It's not really that bad.
00:40:38.583,00:40:42.041,What? What?
00:40:42.083,00:40:46.375,"Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!"
00:40:57.000,00:40:58.959,There's someone here.
00:41:00.625,00:41:03.041,He stole your underwear.
00:41:03.083,00:41:05.959,I don't see anyone.
00:41:25.083,00:41:26.917,Where are my boots?
00:41:26.959,00:41:30.667,Why are you showing me poisons? Can't you understand English?
00:41:30.709,00:41:33.417,"Potions, I said."
00:41:39.583,00:41:42.000,"Love potion, please."
00:41:42.041,00:41:45.709,I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!
00:41:48.000,00:41:49.959,Should've left you at the flea market.
00:41:52.250,00:41:57.834,First thing to do is-- sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.
00:42:04.125,00:42:06.709,Wanna go?
00:42:06.750,00:42:08.417,I want to have a baby.
00:42:08.458,00:42:11.792,Let's talk about it later.
00:42:11.834,00:42:14.542,No! I want to have a baby.
00:42:16.041,00:42:18.959,I don't think we're ready.
00:42:19.000,00:42:22.041,You're not ready.
00:42:22.083,00:42:24.917,"Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?"
00:42:24.959,00:42:26.709,What?
00:42:28.834,00:42:30.542,I don't wanna talk about it here.
00:42:30.583,00:42:33.291,I can't hear you.
00:42:33.333,00:42:35.750,I don't wanna talk about this!
00:42:35.792,00:42:38.458,We're fucking gonna talk about it!
00:42:35.792,00:42:41.250,I... don't... want... to-- You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!
00:42:41.291,00:42:43.625,"I'm sorry, Clem."
00:42:43.667,00:42:49.000,"I love children, I'm creative and smart, and I'd make a fucking great mother!"
00:42:49.041,00:42:52.208,"It's you, Joel. It's you who can't commit to anything!"
00:42:52.250,00:42:55.083,It's going! It's going!
00:42:55.125,00:42:58.375,"Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!"
00:42:58.417,00:43:02.417,Leave you at the flea market with stupid costume jewelry!
00:43:02.458,00:43:05.083,Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!
00:43:05.125,00:43:16.458,"- All the pain, confusion-- Oh. Hi, Patrick."
00:43:16.500,00:43:19.041,"Hey, you."
00:43:19.083,00:43:21.041,Find us okay?
00:43:24.625,00:43:27.041,Mmm.
00:43:29.083,00:43:30.333,Poor guy.
00:43:30.375,00:43:33.667,Mmm? Oh.
00:43:33.709,00:43:35.375,Don't you have anything real to drink?
00:43:35.417,00:43:38.417,"Uh, we haven't really checked yet."
00:43:38.458,00:43:40.041,Patrick?
00:43:40.083,00:43:41.667,"Uh, let me do the honors."
00:43:44.125,00:43:46.250,Mary hates me.
00:43:46.291,00:43:48.625,Never really had much luck with the ladies.
00:43:48.667,00:43:51.041,Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.
00:43:51.083,00:43:53.875,Stan. Stan.
00:43:53.917,00:43:55.083,There's more.
00:43:55.125,00:43:56.959,Yes.
00:43:57.000,00:44:00.917,"Hey, hey!"
00:44:00.959,00:44:03.166,"Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick?"
00:44:03.208,00:44:06.917,"Uh, no, that's okay."
00:44:06.959,00:44:10.750,"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
00:44:12.458,00:44:14.625,Oh.
00:44:14.667,00:44:16.458,Oh!
00:44:16.500,00:44:19.583,Mmm!
00:44:22.250,00:44:25.125,That's Nietzsche.
00:44:25.166,00:44:27.542,I found it in my Bartlett's.
00:44:27.583,00:44:29.667,What's your Bartlett's?
00:44:29.709,00:44:33.500,"It's a quote book, Patrick."
00:44:33.542,00:44:36.250,I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.
00:44:36.291,00:44:37.917,Definitely.
00:44:37.959,00:44:40.500,God!
00:44:40.542,00:44:43.250,Can you wake him up?
00:44:43.291,00:44:46.000,You can't wake him up.
00:44:48.291,00:44:49.667,Mmm.
00:44:54.000,00:44:56.000,"You don't tell me things, Joel."
00:44:58.125,00:44:59.875,I'm an open book.
00:45:01.458,00:45:03.417,I tell you everything.
00:45:03.458,00:45:06.291,Every damn embarrassing thing.
00:45:09.250,00:45:11.375,You don't trust me.
00:45:11.417,00:45:14.667,Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
00:45:17.458,00:45:19.041,I don't do that.
00:45:21.834,00:45:23.834,I want to know you.
00:45:25.208,00:45:26.875,Hmm?
00:45:26.917,00:45:30.041,I don't constantly talk.
00:45:32.041,00:45:34.250,"People have to share things, Joel."
00:45:34.291,00:45:35.959,Mm-hmm.
00:45:36.000,00:45:39.041,That's what intimacy is.
00:45:39.083,00:45:41.375,I'm really pissed that you said that to me.
00:45:41.417,00:45:42.834,I'm sorry.
00:45:42.875,00:45:45.667,It just-- really just isn't that interesting.
00:45:47.542,00:45:50.417,some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.
00:45:50.458,00:45:55.291,What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or... love?
00:46:02.792,00:46:07.750,"November 19, 2003."
00:46:07.792,00:46:09.875,Dinner at Kang's again.
00:46:12.250,00:46:15.834,Are we like those poor couples...
00:46:15.875,00:46:18.625,you feel sorry for in restaurants?
00:46:18.667,00:46:21.125,Are we the dining dead?
00:46:21.166,00:46:25.583,I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
00:46:29.667,00:46:32.041,I like that.
00:46:34.375,00:46:36.458,How's the chicken?
00:46:36.500,00:46:38.667,Good.
00:46:39.417,00:46:42.709,More?
00:46:45.083,00:46:47.959,She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.
00:46:48.000,00:46:49.917,"Hey, would you do me a favor..."
00:46:49.959,00:46:53.542,and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?
00:46:53.583,00:46:55.375,Yeah. Oh. Yeah.
00:46:53.583,00:46:56.792,It's really--- - Gross.
00:46:59.375,00:47:01.750,- It's just-- - Repulsive.
00:47:01.792,00:47:03.375,It's repulsive.
00:47:09.625,00:47:11.959,can we get through this?
00:47:12.000,00:47:13.750,Patrick.
00:47:13.792,00:47:15.667,"Hey, Tangerine."
00:47:15.709,00:47:18.000,"Oh, Patrick, it's you."
00:47:18.041,00:47:21.834,I'm so miserable right now.
00:47:21.875,00:47:24.000,Why? What's wrong?
00:47:24.041,00:47:26.792,Excuse me?
00:47:26.834,00:47:28.500,"Can I help you find something, sir?"
00:47:28.542,00:47:32.166,What are you confused about?
00:47:32.208,00:47:34.375,"Baby, come here."
00:47:34.417,00:47:35.792,Scared of what?
00:47:36.917,00:47:40.500,I don't know.
00:47:40.542,00:47:43.041,Do you love me?
00:47:43.083,00:47:45.208,Where's the self-help section?
00:47:45.250,00:47:47.417,Do you think I'm ugly?
00:47:47.458,00:47:49.917,No! You're beautiful!
00:47:49.959,00:47:52.250,Maybe I should come over.
00:47:52.291,00:47:56.667,I don't know.
00:47:56.709,00:47:58.583,"Well, just let me come over."
00:47:58.625,00:48:00.291,Okay.
00:48:00.333,00:48:03.417,"Stan, can I leave for a while?"
00:48:03.458,00:48:09.750,"Patrick, we're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's-- Let him go, Stan!"
00:48:10.917,00:48:12.500,See?
00:48:12.542,00:48:16.500,- She hates me.
00:48:16.542,00:48:19.458,All right.
00:48:19.500,00:48:21.041,You like?
00:48:21.083,00:48:24.542,"Oh, man!"
00:48:24.583,00:48:26.417,I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
00:48:26.458,00:48:28.208,I like it.
00:48:28.250,00:48:30.750,You look like a tangerine.
00:48:30.792,00:48:34.208,Clemen-teen the tangerine.
00:48:34.250,00:48:37.000,And seedless.
00:48:38.500,00:48:41.458,I like tangerines!
00:48:41.500,00:48:43.834,Can you see me doing ducks?
00:48:43.875,00:48:46.166,Joel. Ducks.
00:48:46.208,00:48:48.959,How does he know to call you that?
00:48:49.000,00:48:51.750,"Oh, my God. Clem?"
00:48:51.792,00:48:53.208,That's what they called themselves.
00:48:53.250,00:48:56.000,The Clash-- the only band that mattered.
00:48:56.041,00:48:57.834,They called themselves that for a reason.
00:48:57.875,00:48:59.542,"It's amazing, isn't it?"
00:48:59.583,00:49:01.959,"Like social justice-- Yeah, it's totally incredible."
00:49:02.000,00:49:04.583,What Howard gives to the world.
00:49:05.834,00:49:07.709,Yeah.
00:49:07.750,00:49:10.000,To let people begin again.
00:49:11.667,00:49:13.583,It's beautiful.
00:49:13.625,00:49:18.834,"You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean."
00:49:18.875,00:49:22.291,"And adults are, like, this mess of sadness..."
00:49:22.333,00:49:26.208,and... phobias.
00:49:26.250,00:49:28.083,Howard just makes it all go away.
00:49:38.208,00:49:39.917,"Oh, my God."
00:49:42.166,00:49:45.250,"Baby, what's going on?"
00:49:45.291,00:49:49.250,I'm lost. I'm scared.
00:49:49.291,00:49:52.000,Disappearing?
00:49:52.041,00:49:54.667,Nothing makes any sense to me!
00:49:54.709,00:49:57.500,Nothing makes any sense.
00:49:57.542,00:50:01.291,"Oh, Tangerine."
00:50:01.333,00:50:04.917,"Nothing makes any sense, Patrick."
00:50:04.959,00:50:08.750,"Hey, let's go out dancing."
00:50:08.792,00:50:10.875,Montauk?
00:50:10.917,00:50:12.917,No! Come up to Boston with me.
00:50:12.959,00:50:14.875,Sure. Yeah.
00:50:14.917,00:50:18.291,"No, no. Now. Now."
00:50:18.333,00:50:20.500,I have to see the frozen Charles now.
00:50:24.709,00:50:26.625,"Hi, it's Joel."
00:50:26.667,00:50:32.083,"Um, leave a message after the beep, and I'll get back to you."
00:50:33.834,00:50:36.417,"Pick up! Pick up, man!"
00:50:36.458,00:50:41.000,W-W-Whoa.
00:50:41.041,00:50:44.250,"Hello? Yeah, what's up?"
00:50:44.291,00:50:46.917,I got into a little situation with the old lady.
00:50:46.959,00:50:49.875,Can you handle things tonight alone?
00:50:49.917,00:50:52.375,Don't worry about it.
00:50:52.417,00:50:54.709,He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
00:50:54.750,00:50:56.166,"Thanks, Stan."
00:50:56.208,00:50:58.875,"Dude, I gotta go."
00:51:01.250,00:51:02.792,Charles.
00:51:05.583,00:51:06.959,Come on. Charles.
00:51:11.750,00:51:14.667,"Look! You and me, on the Charles River!"
00:51:14.709,00:51:19.083,"I could die right now, Clem."
00:51:19.125,00:51:24.792,I'm just exactly where I want-- I'm so excited. Yea.
00:51:24.834,00:51:28.709,Cool.
00:51:24.834,00:51:34.792,"Oh, uh, I, uh-- I got you this-- What?"
00:51:31.667,00:51:37.208,"thing, um-- Happy early Valentine's Day."
00:51:37.250,00:51:38.625,Oh!
00:51:40.375,00:51:42.458,Wow. What is it?
00:51:42.500,00:51:45.083,"Uh, I don't know."
00:51:50.250,00:51:52.458,Oh.
00:51:52.500,00:51:54.458,It-- It's gorgeous!
00:51:54.500,00:51:57.583,- You like it?
00:51:57.625,00:52:00.208,I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.
00:52:02.542,00:52:03.917,Thank you.
00:52:11.458,00:52:12.875,Let's go.
00:52:12.917,00:52:15.959,Joely?
00:52:17.917,00:52:20.500,Am I ugly?
00:52:20.542,00:52:24.125,Mm-mmm.
00:52:24.166,00:52:28.667,I'm crying already.
00:52:28.709,00:52:31.166,Sometimes I think people don't understand...
00:52:31.208,00:52:34.458,how lonely it is to be a kid.
00:52:34.500,00:52:37.083,Like you don't matter.
00:52:37.125,00:52:44.959,"So, I'm eight, and I have these toys, these dolls."
00:52:45.000,00:52:49.875,My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
00:52:49.917,00:52:54.875,And I keep yelling at her: You can't be ugly! Be pretty!
00:52:56.375,00:52:57.667,It's weird.
00:52:57.709,00:53:03.917,Like if I can transform her-- I would magically change too.
00:53:08.875,00:53:10.291,You're pretty.
00:53:10.333,00:53:13.959,"Joely, don't ever leave me."
00:53:14.000,00:53:18.333,Pretty. Pretty.
00:53:18.375,00:53:21.875,"Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory."
00:53:21.917,00:53:24.125,Just this one.
00:53:24.166,00:53:26.834,I don't wanna hold your hand.
00:53:26.875,00:53:28.250,Whoo!
00:53:29.750,00:53:31.291,Stop it!
00:53:34.291,00:53:36.500,"I could die right now, Clem."
00:53:38.709,00:53:40.083,I'm just...
00:53:41.709,00:53:44.000,happy.
00:53:46.250,00:53:48.208,I've never felt that before.
00:53:49.542,00:53:51.500,Mmm.
00:53:51.542,00:53:53.542,I'm just exactly...
00:53:56.250,00:53:57.917,where I wanna be.
00:54:00.583,00:54:01.583,Clem?
00:54:07.333,00:54:09.792,I want to call it off.
00:54:09.834,00:54:11.834,I'll give you a sign.
00:54:17.208,00:54:18.208,I want to call it off.
00:54:20.709,00:54:22.917,Can you hear me?
00:54:22.959,00:54:26.250,I want to call it off!
00:54:31.959,00:54:34.667,Is anybody there?
00:54:42.166,00:54:44.792,Clementine!
00:54:44.834,00:54:47.250,Clement-- Joely!
00:54:47.291,00:54:49.000,Clem!
00:54:49.041,00:54:50.208,Clem.
00:54:50.250,00:54:53.083,Clem!
00:54:53.125,00:54:55.250,We gotta go.
00:54:55.291,00:54:57.750,I have an idea of how to stop this.
00:54:59.333,00:55:01.750,Joely.
00:55:01.792,00:55:03.208,No!
00:55:03.250,00:55:05.709,No! No! No!
00:55:05.750,00:55:07.917,Don't. Smell me.
00:55:07.959,00:55:10.208,No. Come on.
00:55:11.959,00:55:14.333,We gotta get back to the office.
00:55:14.375,00:55:16.875,There was a tape recorder.
00:55:16.917,00:55:18.834,Not the picture.
00:55:18.875,00:55:22.375,Where is it?
00:55:22.417,00:55:24.792,"Oh, look at me."
00:55:24.834,00:55:30.500,"Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence."
00:55:30.542,00:55:34.083,"Suffice it to say that Miss, uh-- Miss Kruczynski..."
00:55:34.125,00:55:39.500,was not happy and she wanted to move on.
00:55:39.542,00:55:42.542,"Now, tell me about Clementine."
00:55:42.583,00:55:45.667,That's what he said. Then-- What did we see that day?
00:55:45.709,00:55:47.417,"No, wait."
00:55:47.458,00:55:50.375,Shit!
00:55:50.417,00:55:53.083,"Joel, what? No, I don't want to-- Joel, please!"
00:55:53.125,00:55:55.625,Don't make me run anymore.
00:55:55.667,00:55:58.125,Mierzwiak!
00:55:58.166,00:56:00.959,Do we always have to run?
00:56:10.959,00:56:12.625,Please.
00:56:12.667,00:56:15.917,"So, why don't we begin by you telling me..."
00:56:15.959,00:56:18.125,everything you can remember.
00:56:18.166,00:56:20.834,Mierzwiak! Wake me up!
00:56:20.875,00:56:23.959,"Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish."
00:56:24.000,00:56:27.041,I thought you understood what was going on here.
00:56:27.083,00:56:30.083,I don't know.
00:56:30.125,00:56:37.667,You're erasing me from her-- I don't know.
00:56:37.709,00:56:41.333,You've got this thing.
00:56:41.375,00:56:43.333,I'm in my brain.
00:56:43.375,00:56:46.291,"I'm part of your imagination too, Joel."
00:56:46.333,00:56:49.166,How can I help you from there?
00:56:49.208,00:56:53.125,"Uh, I'm inside your head too."
00:56:53.166,00:56:56.250,Sorry.
00:56:56.291,00:56:58.417,Look. Who's that?
00:56:58.458,00:57:00.583,"Oh, he-he works for us."
00:57:00.625,00:57:07.917,"That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick, baby boy."
00:57:07.959,00:57:10.625,He's stealing my identity.
00:57:10.667,00:57:13.208,He stole my stuff.
00:57:13.250,00:57:16.917,"He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things."
00:57:16.959,00:57:20.542,He stole her underwear.
00:57:20.583,00:57:22.250,He stole her underwear.
00:57:22.291,00:57:25.583,"I could die right now, Clem."
00:57:25.625,00:57:28.250,I'm just happy.
00:57:28.291,00:57:32.542,I've never felt that before.
00:57:34.208,00:57:35.959,I want to go home.
00:57:37.333,00:57:39.000,Hey. What?
00:57:41.792,00:57:45.375,Clem!
00:57:45.417,00:57:47.166,Wait. Clem!
00:57:49.125,00:57:50.792,Clem?
00:57:50.834,00:57:53.208,They're erasing you.
00:57:53.250,00:57:55.208,I'm here!
00:57:55.250,00:57:57.875,"Clem, focus."
00:57:57.917,00:58:00.166,I'm sorry.
00:58:00.208,00:58:03.333,"Sweetie, calm down."
00:58:03.375,00:58:06.333,I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.
00:58:08.542,00:58:12.667,"Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then."
00:58:12.709,00:58:16.792,What the hell are you talking about? I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.
00:58:16.834,00:58:18.166,Wake yourself up!
00:58:18.208,00:58:20.375,Okay. You want me to wake up?
00:58:20.417,00:58:23.583,"Okay, here we go."
00:58:23.625,00:58:26.458,I'll try really hard.
00:58:26.500,00:58:29.542,Yeah. Okay.
00:58:29.583,00:58:32.083,"Boy, that's working like gangbusters."
00:58:32.125,00:58:34.583,Don't! That tickles me!
00:58:34.625,00:58:36.959,"Oh, my God. What is that?"
00:58:34.625,00:58:38.959,Jesus Christ! What the-- It's a birthmark!
00:58:42.291,00:58:48.458,"It did work, for a second, but I couldn't-- I couldn't move."
00:58:48.500,00:58:53.083,"Oh, well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?"
00:58:53.125,00:58:58.375,"It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually-- Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?"
00:58:58.417,00:59:00.041,Fine.
00:59:02.208,00:59:05.375,Then what? I'm listening.
00:59:05.417,00:59:07.709,I don't know.
00:59:07.750,00:59:10.500,That's why I'm here.
00:59:10.542,00:59:12.083,I'm sorry.
00:59:12.125,00:59:14.000,You know me.
00:59:18.375,00:59:20.250,That's what I love about you.
00:59:23.917,00:59:25.667,Joel?
00:59:25.709,00:59:29.291,I have another idea for this problem.
00:59:29.333,00:59:35.834,"This is a memory of me, the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch."
00:59:35.875,00:59:38.792,What?
00:59:35.875,00:59:45.625,"Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?"
00:59:51.500,00:59:54.750,"Oh, man. I can't remember anything without you."
00:59:54.792,00:59:58.125,"Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?"
00:59:58.166,01:00:00.041,Okay.
01:00:24.500,01:00:26.542,It's working!
01:00:26.583,01:00:29.834,I'm a genius!
01:00:50.959,01:00:52.041,Joel?
01:00:53.291,01:00:54.417,Joel?
01:00:56.291,01:00:58.542,Where'd you go?
01:00:58.583,01:01:00.667,I'm supposed to come too!
01:01:00.709,01:01:04.208,a salad bowl. Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?
01:01:04.250,01:01:05.959,Sure.
01:01:06.000,01:01:08.000,Absolutely!
01:01:08.041,01:01:12.333,It worked.
01:01:12.375,01:01:16.583,It worked! Look!
01:01:16.625,01:01:21.834,"Oh, my God! Look at it!"
01:01:21.875,01:01:23.041,Who am I?
01:01:23.083,01:01:25.667,Mrs. Hamlyn.
01:01:25.709,01:01:28.458,I must be about four.
01:01:28.500,01:01:31.667,"Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans."
01:01:31.709,01:01:33.834,Is he okay under there?
01:01:33.875,01:01:36.834,"God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day."
01:01:36.875,01:01:41.333,Would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
01:01:41.375,01:01:43.792,"Oh, my God."
01:01:43.834,01:01:46.834,Thank you so much.
01:01:46.875,01:01:50.083,She's busy.
01:01:50.125,01:01:53.375,No one ever looks at me.
01:01:53.417,01:01:56.667,"Oh, baby Joel."
01:01:56.709,01:01:58.959,Is every little peanut under there okay?
01:01:59.000,01:02:01.166,Do you have something to drink?
01:02:01.208,01:02:03.834,Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
01:02:03.875,01:02:06.458,I would die for a vodka.
01:02:06.500,01:02:09.625,Okay! I'm just gonna wait right here.
01:02:09.667,01:02:11.667,"Uh, Joely."
01:02:11.709,01:02:14.917,"No, your mother wants me to mind you. Get back under the table."
01:02:14.959,01:02:19.083,Ice cream.
01:02:19.125,01:02:22.500,"Come on, Joel!"
01:02:22.542,01:02:23.875,"Joel, grow up!"
01:02:23.917,01:02:26.375,"Don't leave me, Clem."
01:02:26.417,01:02:28.875,This is sort of warped.
01:02:28.917,01:02:32.041,I want my mommy!
01:02:32.083,01:02:36.542,"Baby Joel, it's okay."
01:02:36.583,01:02:39.375,"Stop it! Look, I think it's working. Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!"
01:02:39.417,01:02:42.250,"Hey, honey, look."
01:02:42.291,01:02:43.667,Wait there.
01:02:47.709,01:02:50.959,"My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it."
01:02:51.000,01:02:53.125,Yuck.
01:02:55.375,01:02:58.375,It stopped.
01:02:58.417,01:03:00.166,What?
01:03:00.208,01:03:02.291,It stopped erasing.
01:03:02.333,01:03:03.583,"Oh, shit."
01:03:04.917,01:03:06.625,This is terrible.
01:03:08.917,01:03:10.959,He's off the map.
01:03:11.000,01:03:14.542,Where?
01:03:14.583,01:03:18.500,This is bad.
01:03:18.542,01:03:21.291,Okay. Crap.
01:03:21.333,01:03:24.333,Okay. What do we do?
01:03:24.375,01:03:27.291,What should we do?
01:03:27.333,01:03:29.208,- What should we do?
01:03:29.250,01:03:31.834,- I just said that I don't know what to do.
01:03:31.875,01:03:35.709,"I don't know. Now, look, you're freaking me out."
01:03:35.750,01:03:39.583,"Well, you have to do something."
01:03:39.625,01:03:42.458,Quiet. You're freaking me out. Shh. Shh.
01:03:39.625,01:03:44.125,All gooey and-- half-baked.
01:03:44.166,01:03:45.667,"Hmm, that sounds so good."
01:03:45.709,01:03:47.542,"Oh, shit!"
01:03:47.583,01:03:49.542,"Oh, shit!"
01:03:49.583,01:03:52.125,What? Oh!
01:03:52.166,01:03:55.083,- We should call Howard.
01:03:55.125,01:03:57.250,This is my-- I can handle this.
01:03:57.291,01:03:59.542,I can't call Howard.
01:03:59.583,01:04:02.458,He's-- There's no time to fuck around.
01:04:02.500,01:04:05.000,I got this under control.
01:04:05.041,01:04:07.834,Stop fucking around!
01:04:07.875,01:04:10.875,Mmm.
01:04:15.792,01:04:19.250,Hello.
01:04:19.291,01:04:25.875,"I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can't-- I can't bring him back up."
01:04:25.917,01:04:29.500,"Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared."
01:04:29.542,01:04:32.875,"Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute..."
01:04:32.917,01:04:37.250,"and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh-- I had to pee."
01:04:37.291,01:04:41.291,Where's Patrick?
01:04:41.333,01:04:44.041,"Ah, geez."
01:04:44.083,01:04:46.291,"Okay, what's the address?"
01:04:46.333,01:04:49.583,That's okay. Come on.
01:04:49.625,01:04:53.041,Yeah.
01:04:53.083,01:04:56.000,Mary? He's coming right now.
01:04:56.041,01:04:58.000,I'm staying.
01:04:58.041,01:05:00.333,"- Get your stuff, Mary."
01:05:00.375,01:05:02.834,I think you should go.
01:05:02.875,01:05:06.667,Mary-- Shit.
01:05:06.709,01:05:10.750,I am so stoned.
01:05:10.792,01:05:13.041,You have to go.
01:05:13.083,01:05:16.125,I don't want him to see me stoned.
01:05:16.166,01:05:23.500,"You have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes-- Joely, stop it! Joel!"
01:05:29.291,01:05:31.583,Joel!
01:05:31.625,01:05:34.875,It's weird how strong that desire is.
01:05:34.917,01:05:40.667,"You'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over."
01:05:40.709,01:05:43.208,Pat? I just-- Pat?
01:05:43.250,01:05:45.250,I thought we could have a little cocktail.
01:05:45.291,01:05:48.667,That Patrick guy-- he's copying me.
01:05:48.709,01:05:49.709,What Patrick guy?
01:05:49.750,01:05:51.417,That guy!
01:05:51.458,01:05:53.709,He's here in my apartment.
01:05:53.750,01:05:55.375,He's one of those eraser guys.
01:05:55.417,01:06:02.542,"He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you, and you guys are dating."
01:06:02.583,01:06:05.625,Really? Is he cute?
01:06:08.125,01:06:10.667,"Clem, there's nothing wrong with you."
01:06:10.709,01:06:13.250,You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
01:06:13.291,01:06:18.625,You-- You're kind-- you're beautiful...
01:06:18.667,01:06:20.750,and smart and funny...
01:06:20.792,01:06:23.083,and... nice.
01:06:24.417,01:06:25.417,What?
01:06:27.250,01:06:29.041,Okay. All right.
01:06:30.417,01:06:33.000,Okay. Oh!
01:06:33.041,01:06:35.667,"Move, move, move!"
01:06:35.709,01:06:37.166,Fine.
01:06:37.208,01:06:40.750,I'm still stoned.
01:06:40.792,01:06:43.083,Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.
01:06:47.709,01:06:49.625,Be cool. Cool.
01:06:54.583,01:06:56.750,"Hello, Mary."
01:06:56.792,01:06:58.542,She was just here to help out.
01:06:58.583,01:07:01.500,I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
01:07:01.542,01:07:05.583,I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings...
01:07:05.625,01:07:07.250,of the work that we do.
01:07:07.291,01:07:10.667,"Well, not that I do, but the work that is done..."
01:07:10.709,01:07:15.458,"by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues."
01:07:15.500,01:07:20.250,"All right, well, let's see if we can, uh, get to the bottom of this, shall we?"
01:07:20.291,01:07:27.375,"Uh, yeah. Um-- Well, that's odd."
01:07:27.417,01:07:30.375,Did you try going through the C-gate?
01:07:30.792,01:07:33.208,I mean... yes.
01:07:34.250,01:07:35.583,Yeah.
01:07:37.542,01:07:39.417,All right.
01:07:41.333,01:07:42.834,You want to get linked up?
01:07:42.875,01:07:44.500,All right.
01:07:46.083,01:07:54.083,"I already-- I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs."
01:07:54.125,01:07:55.417,"Here, Howard."
01:07:55.458,01:07:57.750,I got you a chair.
01:07:57.792,01:08:00.542,You're welcome. Whew!
01:08:00.583,01:08:05.959,"All right, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go through the entire memory, see if something comes up."
01:08:12.625,01:08:15.375,I love being bathed in the sink.
01:08:15.417,01:08:18.291,Such a feeling of security.
01:08:18.333,01:08:21.375,"I've never seen you happier, baby Joel."
01:08:21.417,01:08:23.417,There it is.
01:08:23.458,01:08:27.917,I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
01:08:27.959,01:08:29.834,What the heck was he doing there?
01:08:39.500,01:08:41.250,His eyes are open.
01:08:43.333,01:08:46.125,- Has this happened before with him?
01:08:47.166,01:08:49.667,"Oh, this is-- this is not good. No."
01:08:50.709,01:08:54.709,I'm gonna have to-- I'm gonna have to give him this.
01:09:19.083,01:09:21.750,"Can't you see I love you, Antoine?"
01:09:22.792,01:09:24.041,"Okay, we're back in."
01:09:25.083,01:09:28.250,"Wow. That was beautiful to watch, Howard."
01:09:28.291,01:09:32.041,Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
01:09:34.083,01:09:36.041,"Thank you, Mary."
01:09:36.083,01:09:39.750,"Um, Howard, you should get some sleep."
01:09:39.792,01:09:44.917,"Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?"
01:09:44.959,01:09:46.542,Hmm. Lucky me.
01:09:46.583,01:09:50.834,Lay one on me.
01:09:52.583,01:09:54.250,Don't call me Antoine.
01:09:54.291,01:09:56.125,My name is Wally.
01:09:54.291,01:09:59.083,"Yes, I know, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?"
01:09:59.125,01:10:01.917,Oh! Oh! What was that?
01:10:01.959,01:10:04.625,Hey.
01:10:04.667,01:10:07.000,There is?
01:10:08.500,01:10:10.458,- Got it.
01:10:10.500,01:10:13.959,"What, Joel-- What are you doing?"
01:10:14.000,01:10:16.333,"Go on. Please, please, go."
01:10:19.417,01:10:21.250,"You can run, but you can't hide."
01:10:21.291,01:10:23.083,"Clem, come on!"
01:10:24.125,01:10:26.417,There I am.
01:10:27.083,01:10:28.041,That truck.
01:10:28.083,01:10:31.291,Doc? Please.
01:10:31.333,01:10:35.291,"All right, let's begin by you telling me..."
01:10:35.333,01:10:42.291,everything you remember-- That's strange.
01:10:42.333,01:10:46.500,"Oh, well, at least we know where he is."
01:10:46.542,01:10:48.583,"Come on, Clem."
01:10:48.625,01:10:50.458,to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.
01:10:50.500,01:10:53.875,I don't want to run anymore.
01:10:56.166,01:10:59.542,"Come on, come on."
01:10:59.583,01:11:02.208,Where?
01:11:03.375,01:11:06.250,Humiliation.
01:11:06.291,01:11:08.083,"I'm sorry, okay?"
01:11:11.792,01:11:14.834,Let me drive you home.
01:11:14.875,01:11:16.291,Joel!
01:11:17.000,01:11:19.875,"- No, wait. Howard."
01:11:20.750,01:11:22.041,He's disappeared again.
01:11:23.083,01:11:27.208,"Oh, dear."
01:11:27.250,01:11:29.583,Humiliation.
01:11:29.625,01:11:32.041,Humiliation.
01:11:32.083,01:11:35.125,Humili-- Joel.
01:11:35.166,01:11:37.417,I don't like it either.
01:11:37.458,01:11:45.917,"I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to-- Joel, honey, I have a surprise-- I just-- Oh, um-- Uh, you know what, honey?"
01:11:45.959,01:11:48.792,"Good night, sweetheart."
01:11:48.834,01:11:51.166,No.
01:11:51.208,01:11:52.625,"I'm sorry, Joel."
01:11:52.667,01:11:54.125,Shut up.
01:11:55.375,01:11:58.250,Look! Joel!
01:11:58.291,01:12:00.250,"Joel, look!"
01:12:00.291,01:12:02.333,Look where we are!
01:12:02.375,01:12:04.709,Whoo!
01:12:04.750,01:12:07.375,"Clem, this isn't good."
01:12:07.417,01:12:11.875,Then hide me somewhere-- somewhere really buried.
01:12:13.250,01:12:16.834,Hit it! Hit it!
01:12:16.875,01:12:19.250,I'll do it later!
01:12:21.417,01:12:25.792,"Come on, you big sissy!"
01:12:34.125,01:12:37.250,Ooh!
01:12:37.291,01:12:39.291,"Ooh, he has a girlfriend!"
01:12:39.333,01:12:42.333,Wait. What am I doing?
01:12:42.375,01:12:44.709,You don't scare me anymore.
01:12:44.750,01:12:46.792,Joel!
01:12:46.834,01:12:49.625,"Joely, get up."
01:12:49.667,01:12:54.166,"They're not worth it, Joel!"
01:12:54.208,01:12:56.083,"Come on, Joel."
01:13:02.709,01:13:06.375,I'm so ashamed.
01:13:06.417,01:13:08.417,You were a little kid.
01:13:08.458,01:13:11.417,Come on.
01:13:11.458,01:13:13.417,I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
01:13:13.458,01:13:17.333,Do you like my pink hat?
01:13:17.375,01:13:20.125,It's my turn.
01:13:20.166,01:13:22.709,Okay.
01:13:22.750,01:13:25.250,You're dead.
01:13:25.291,01:13:28.458,"Oh, my mom."
01:13:28.500,01:13:29.834,"Hi, Joel's mom."
01:13:29.875,01:13:33.417,He's killing me.
01:13:33.458,01:13:35.792,You're dead!
01:13:35.834,01:13:37.417,"Uh, I think I got the hang of this."
01:13:37.458,01:13:40.834,"I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough."
01:13:56.083,01:13:58.041,Clem!
01:13:59.291,01:14:01.500,Clem!
01:14:16.458,01:14:18.667,Jo-- Joely?
01:14:18.709,01:14:20.667,"Are you okay, Joel?"
01:14:20.709,01:14:24.125,Joel? Joel?
01:14:24.166,01:14:26.000,"Oh, my God."
01:14:26.041,01:14:28.291,"Okay, okay."
01:14:28.333,01:14:31.375,All right.
01:14:31.417,01:14:33.417,Okay.
01:14:42.917,01:14:45.375,Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!
01:14:45.417,01:14:47.291,Look at this.
01:14:47.333,01:14:49.375,Cool. Look out! Look out!
01:14:53.500,01:14:54.500,It's fluff.
01:14:56.291,01:14:57.959,Our house!
01:14:59.625,01:15:02.709,Come on. Whoo-hoo!
01:15:02.750,01:15:03.709,Come on. We gotta go!
01:15:03.750,01:15:06.583,Whoo!
01:15:06.625,01:15:08.333,Come on!
01:15:09.667,01:15:11.333,We gotta go. Clem?
01:15:11.375,01:15:14.542,We gotta go.
01:15:14.583,01:15:16.458,Aah! Come on!
01:15:16.500,01:15:18.583,No!
01:15:18.625,01:15:21.834,"Get off me! Oh, God!"
01:15:21.875,01:15:24.834,I don't even know where we're going.
01:15:24.875,01:15:27.583,It's the best place.
01:15:27.625,01:15:32.208,"No, no, no. This way."
01:15:32.250,01:15:34.709,What's wrong with you?
01:15:34.750,01:15:38.083,"Let go of me, Joel!"
01:15:49.792,01:15:52.542,"I like watching you work, Howard."
01:15:55.875,01:16:03.166,"I guess, uh-- I guess I'll go out for-- for some air, if nobody minds."
01:16:03.208,01:16:06.625,It looks like you have everything under control here.
01:16:06.667,01:16:10.041,"Yeah, that's, uh-- that's fine."
01:16:19.875,01:16:22.959,"Do you like quotes, Howard?"
01:16:24.667,01:16:25.834,What do you mean?
01:16:25.875,01:16:28.959,"Oh, you know, like famous quotes?"
01:16:29.000,01:16:35.208,"I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too."
01:16:35.250,01:16:38.875,"Oh, well, I-- I'd love to hear some."
01:16:38.917,01:16:44.959,"There's one that goes, Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
01:16:45.000,01:16:47.166,"That's Nietzsche, right?"
01:16:47.208,01:16:49.583,And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
01:16:49.625,01:16:53.291,It's-- It's a good quote.
01:16:53.333,01:16:56.333,"Yeah. Oh, and there's this other one I like."
01:16:56.375,01:17:02.041,"It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes-- Alexander Pope?"
01:17:02.083,01:17:03.959,Yeah. Shit.
01:17:04.000,01:17:09.166,"It's just that I told myself not to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it."
01:17:09.208,01:17:13.125,It's no big deal.
01:17:15.166,01:17:18.875,"The quote goes, How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?"
01:17:20.250,01:17:22.125,"The world forgetting, by the world forgot."
01:17:24.166,01:17:26.583,Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
01:17:27.917,01:17:31.709,Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned.
01:17:31.750,01:17:36.750,"I want to be a great big, huge elephant..."
01:17:36.792,01:17:39.041,with a huge trunk like that.
01:17:40.542,01:17:43.500,Clem? Clementine?
01:17:43.542,01:17:46.542,I haven't heard that one.
01:17:46.583,01:17:49.291,"I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe."
01:17:54.125,01:17:57.875,"I really admire the work you do, Howard."
01:17:57.917,01:18:00.083,I don't mean to be so familiar.
01:18:00.125,01:18:09.709,I-I-I-I-I-- I'm happy to hear-- I'm sorry.
01:18:13.959,01:18:15.917,I've loved you for a very long time.
01:18:19.500,01:18:21.959,I shouldn't have said that.
01:18:22.000,01:18:25.083,It's-- You're a wonderful girl.
01:18:25.125,01:18:29.041,"But I-- You know, I have a wife and kids."
01:18:29.083,01:18:31.417,You know I have a wife and kids.
01:18:31.458,01:18:32.750,"Oh, Mary."
01:18:34.917,01:18:37.750,"Oh, Mary, we can't do this."
01:18:47.709,01:18:49.750,"Oh, whoa."
01:18:54.291,01:18:56.375,"Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak."
01:19:06.125,01:19:07.417,What?
01:19:07.458,01:19:08.500,Who is it?
01:19:14.583,01:19:23.959,"Uh-- Thank you, Stan."
01:19:29.583,01:19:32.041,Hollis. Hollis!
01:19:32.083,01:19:34.667,Hollis!
01:19:34.709,01:19:37.959,"Wait. Wait, wait, wait."
01:19:38.000,01:19:40.834,"- I knew it, Howard."
01:19:40.875,01:19:44.250,I came here to work.
01:19:44.291,01:19:46.333,I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
01:19:46.375,01:19:49.083,I swear I basically forced him into it!
01:19:50.333,01:19:52.875,"Don't be a monster, Howard."
01:19:55.875,01:19:57.834,Tell me what?
01:19:57.875,01:20:00.208,"Oh, you poor kid."
01:20:01.458,01:20:04.417,You can have him.
01:20:15.375,01:20:16.375,What?
01:20:19.709,01:20:28.917,"Oh, uh, we have a history."
01:20:30.542,01:20:33.208,I'm sorry.
01:20:33.250,01:20:37.792,You-- You wanted it done...
01:20:37.834,01:20:44.834,"so you could get past, uh-- You could-- Yeah."
01:20:46.417,01:20:50.875,"Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there."
01:20:50.917,01:20:53.000,It's almost morning.
01:20:50.917,01:20:56.458,We'll-- We'll talk later.
01:20:57.458,01:20:59.083,Okay?
01:21:10.667,01:21:12.333,Hey.
01:21:16.500,01:21:18.250,Let me give you a lift home.
01:21:28.208,01:21:30.625,Fuck this thing. Damn it.
01:21:30.667,01:21:32.750,Hi.
01:21:34.333,01:21:38.667,Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
01:21:38.709,01:21:41.583,I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
01:21:41.625,01:21:44.291,"You did run away, after all."
01:21:44.333,01:21:46.583,I just needed to see ya.
01:21:46.625,01:21:47.709,Yeah?
01:21:48.750,01:21:54.500,"I'd like to, um, take you out or something."
01:21:54.542,01:21:57.083,You're married.
01:21:57.125,01:22:00.250,Not yet. Not married.
01:22:00.291,01:22:02.083,"No, I'm not married, no."
01:22:02.125,01:22:09.250,"Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance, so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage..."
01:22:09.291,01:22:11.709,or whatever it is you've got going there.
01:22:11.875,01:22:14.083,"If you wanna be with me, you're with me."
01:22:15.166,01:22:16.208,Okay.
01:22:17.625,01:22:23.291,"Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive."
01:22:23.333,01:22:27.125,But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
01:22:27.166,01:22:31.792,Don't assign me yours.
01:22:31.834,01:22:35.250,"I had you pegged, didn't I?"
01:22:35.291,01:22:37.041,Hmm. Probably.
01:22:39.500,01:22:43.542,"I still thought you were gonna save my life, even after that."
01:22:43.583,01:22:46.959,Mmm. I know.
01:22:49.333,01:22:51.417,It would be different...
01:22:52.792,01:22:55.041,if we could just give it another go around.
01:22:59.000,01:23:01.500,Remember me.
01:23:01.542,01:23:03.458,Try your best.
01:23:06.000,01:23:07.709,Maybe we can.
01:23:39.250,01:23:44.583,"Okay, so just tell me what you remember, and, uh, then we'll take it from there."
01:23:44.625,01:23:46.917,Okay.
01:23:46.959,01:23:49.875,I liked you immediately.
01:23:49.917,01:23:52.583,You didn't come on to me at all.
01:23:52.625,01:23:55.667,I liked that.
01:23:55.709,01:23:58.709,I was so tongue-tied around you at first.
01:23:58.750,01:24:01.166,I wanted you to think I was smart.
01:24:02.667,01:24:04.875,I couldn't wait to come to work.
01:24:04.917,01:24:08.250,I had these fantasies of us being married...
01:24:08.291,01:24:11.875,and having kids and...
01:24:08.291,01:24:14.583,"just-- Oh, Howie, I can't do this."
01:24:14.625,01:24:17.417,"We agreed it's for the best, Mary."
01:24:17.458,01:24:20.083,"Yeah, I know."
01:24:20.125,01:24:22.083,"Oh, God."
01:24:22.125,01:24:24.041,"I'll take the bottom and you-- Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here."
01:24:24.083,01:24:25.667,I can take that.
01:24:25.709,01:24:28.291,Help me with that.
01:24:25.709,01:24:32.041,"Honey, the cooler is-- That's light, huh?"
01:24:32.083,01:24:33.542,"No, no, no, no!"
01:24:33.583,01:24:35.667,Don't take anything.
01:24:35.709,01:24:37.875,Put the thing up.
01:24:41.208,01:24:43.500,This is the day we met.
01:24:43.542,01:24:47.250,You were down by the surf.
01:24:47.291,01:24:49.959,I remember being drawn to you even then.
01:24:50.000,01:24:53.166,"I thought, Wow, how odd."
01:24:54.625,01:24:58.500,You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well...
01:24:58.542,01:25:00.500,"and even hate, eventually."
01:25:00.542,01:25:04.458,"At the time I thought, How cool!"
01:25:04.500,01:25:05.875,Hi there.
01:25:08.208,01:25:09.458,Hi.
01:25:09.500,01:25:12.458,I saw you sitting over here...
01:25:12.500,01:25:17.417,"by yourself, and I thought, Thank God."
01:25:17.458,01:25:20.250,Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either.
01:25:20.291,01:25:22.500,Yeah.
01:25:22.542,01:25:25.583,I don't ever know what to say.
01:25:25.625,01:25:28.375,I'm Clementine.
01:25:28.417,01:25:31.667,Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
01:25:31.709,01:25:33.792,And then you just took it...
01:25:33.834,01:25:36.250,without waiting for an answer.
01:25:39.917,01:25:46.375,"It was so intimate, like we were already lovers."
01:25:46.417,01:25:48.417,I'm Joel.
01:25:48.458,01:25:50.709,"Hi, Joel."
01:25:50.750,01:25:54.333,"So, no jokes about my name."
01:25:54.375,01:26:01.041,"You mean like-- Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?"
01:26:01.083,01:26:03.333,Yeah. Like that.
01:26:03.375,01:26:05.667,"Oh, no jokes. No jokes."
01:26:05.709,01:26:09.166,One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
01:26:09.208,01:26:10.583,Oh.
01:26:13.125,01:26:15.291,I think your name is magical.
01:26:18.417,01:26:20.583,"This is it, Joel."
01:26:20.625,01:26:22.875,It's gonna be gone soon.
01:26:24.959,01:26:27.500,I know.
01:26:27.542,01:26:29.166,What do we do?
01:26:31.959,01:26:33.083,Enjoy it.
01:26:50.792,01:26:52.875,You married?
01:26:52.917,01:26:55.250,Let's move into this neighborhood!
01:26:55.291,01:26:58.375,I do sort of live with someone though.
01:26:58.417,01:27:01.458,Male or female?
01:27:01.500,01:27:03.834,Female. Female.
01:27:06.250,01:27:08.583,At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
01:27:12.333,01:27:16.083,You know these people?
01:27:17.333,01:27:19.291,They might have a dog.
01:27:19.333,01:27:21.166,There's no dog.
01:27:22.959,01:27:24.917,What are you doing?
01:27:24.959,01:27:28.166,It's freezing out.
01:27:29.166,01:27:30.166,Hoo-hoo!
01:27:31.750,01:27:35.000,- Clementine!
01:27:41.500,01:27:45.375,"Come on, man."
01:27:45.417,01:27:47.750,Nobody's coming here tonight.
01:27:50.500,01:27:51.625,It's dark.
01:27:52.542,01:27:57.375,"So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name?"
01:27:57.417,01:28:02.542,"Naomi, but we're not really-- I mean-- You know, we're-- Whatever."
01:28:02.583,01:28:06.709,So this is great.
01:28:06.750,01:28:09.125,and the liquor cabinet.
01:28:09.166,01:28:10.875,"Oh, God."
01:28:17.542,01:28:18.375,I think we should go.
01:28:18.417,01:28:21.625,There's no phone line.
01:28:21.667,01:28:23.375,I think we should go.
01:28:23.417,01:28:26.542,It's our house...
01:28:26.583,01:28:29.291,We are David and Ruth Laskin.
01:28:30.709,01:28:32.917,Which one do you want to be?
01:28:30.709,01:28:36.000,"Uh-- I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible."
01:28:38.458,01:28:44.000,What are you do-- Alcohol!
01:28:44.041,01:28:46.500,"So, are you okay with wine?"
01:28:46.542,01:28:49.083,I don't know.
01:28:49.125,01:28:53.208,I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more...
01:28:57.000,01:28:59.458,I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
01:29:01.375,01:29:04.375,I've gotta catch my ride.
01:29:05.959,01:29:09.792,So go.
01:29:11.125,01:29:16.750,"I thought maybe you were a nut, but you were exciting."
01:29:17.875,01:29:19.542,I wish you'd stayed.
01:29:19.583,01:29:22.792,I wish I'd stayed too.
01:29:22.834,01:29:25.667,I wish I'd done a lot of things.
01:29:25.709,01:29:35.291,"Oh, God, I wish I had-- I wish I'd stayed. I do."
01:29:35.333,01:29:37.291,"Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone."
01:29:37.333,01:29:40.041,I walked out.
01:29:40.083,01:29:42.667,Why?
01:29:42.709,01:29:46.667,I was like-- It was above my head.
01:29:46.709,01:29:47.792,You were scared?
01:29:47.834,01:29:49.667,Yeah.
01:29:51.250,01:29:54.041,Thought you knew that about me.
01:29:54.083,01:29:58.792,"to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think."
01:29:58.834,01:30:01.500,Was it something I said?
01:30:04.458,01:30:06.750,"You said, So go..."
01:30:06.792,01:30:09.417,"with such disdain, you know?"
01:30:09.458,01:30:12.000,"Oh, I'm sorry."
01:30:17.875,01:30:20.417,Joely?
01:30:20.458,01:30:22.291,What if you stayed this time?
01:30:25.125,01:30:27.208,I walked out the door.
01:30:28.250,01:30:29.709,There's no memory left.
01:30:29.750,01:30:33.166,"Come back and make up a good-bye, at least."
01:30:33.208,01:30:34.917,Let's pretend we had one.
01:30:46.166,01:30:48.667,"Bye, Joel."
01:30:48.709,01:30:50.709,I love you.
01:30:50.750,01:30:53.917,Meet me in Montauk.
01:30:58.917,01:31:03.166,the plane. The plane crashed.
01:31:03.208,01:31:07.542,"the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed."
01:31:07.583,01:31:09.250,It was fucking windy.
01:31:09.291,01:31:11.250,"You're stoned, and you're driving."
01:31:11.291,01:31:13.625,The pot balances it out.
01:31:13.667,01:31:16.500,That's why I smoke it.
01:31:17.834,01:31:20.625,It does.
01:31:20.667,01:31:22.500,It was proven on the Science Network.
01:31:22.542,01:31:26.250,"Honey, just watch the road."
01:31:27.709,01:31:30.834,I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
01:31:30.875,01:31:33.750,She was nice.
01:31:35.917,01:31:39.875,"She was, um, just a girl."
01:31:46.959,01:31:47.959,Okay.
01:32:25.000,01:32:27.750,So I gotta-- I gotta drop the van off.
01:32:27.792,01:32:29.959,"Thanks, Stan. Thanks."
01:32:30.000,01:32:33.291,We'll talk.
01:33:51.417,01:33:52.792,Hey!
01:33:54.875,01:33:56.250,Hey.
01:33:58.208,01:34:00.166,You got all your stuff.
01:34:00.208,01:34:04.625,I take it you're not coming back. I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
01:34:04.667,01:34:08.250,Do you swear you didn't know?
01:34:08.291,01:34:11.333,So you didn't do the erasing?
01:34:11.375,01:34:13.875,And you never even suspected we were together?
01:34:13.917,01:34:16.417,"Once, maybe."
01:34:18.375,01:34:21.375,"I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car."
01:34:21.417,01:34:29.083,"And I saw you two talking, and I-- So I waved to you, and you giggled, and it-- How'd I look?"
01:34:31.667,01:34:33.667,You looked happy.
01:34:33.709,01:34:35.750,Happy with a secret.
01:34:37.583,01:34:39.333,And after that?
01:34:39.375,01:34:44.917,"I never saw you two together again like that, so I just-- I don't know. I just figured I was imagining things."
01:34:52.875,01:34:55.542,Montauk train now boarding on Track B.
01:34:55.583,01:35:04.417,"Next stop, Mastic-Shirley, Speonk, Westhampton, Hampton Bays, Southhampton, Bridgehampton, East Hampton, Amagansett and Montauk."
01:35:04.458,01:35:07.875,Montauk train now boarding on Track B. All aboard.
01:35:11.000,01:35:13.333,"I really like you, Mary Svevo."
01:35:14.667,01:35:16.041,You know that?
01:35:26.917,01:35:27.959,Thanks.
01:36:03.250,01:36:04.291,Let me get my toothbrush.
01:36:04.333,01:36:22.792,"Yeah. Just-- Where are you, Clem?"
01:36:22.834,01:36:28.000,La-la-la-la-la.
01:36:28.041,01:36:29.417,What did I do?
01:36:29.458,01:36:31.834,I love you so much.
01:36:31.875,01:36:34.166,I'll do anything to make you happy.
01:36:34.208,01:36:36.792,"Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it."
01:36:36.834,01:36:40.667,"Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay."
01:36:40.709,01:36:42.291,Oh. Whew.
01:36:53.875,01:36:57.125,"Vámonos, señor."
01:36:57.166,01:36:59.625,I-I had a really nice time last night.
01:37:00.625,01:37:01.625,Nice?
01:37:03.041,01:37:05.750,I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life...
01:37:05.792,01:37:07.125,last night.
01:37:07.166,01:37:09.792,That's better.
01:37:13.083,01:37:16.709,This is weird.
01:37:16.750,01:37:20.083,My name is Mary Svevo.
01:37:20.125,01:37:22.709,I worked for a company you hired to have...
01:37:22.750,01:37:24.375,part of your memory erased.
01:37:26.125,01:37:28.041,I have since decided that this is a horrible-- Some kind of teaser ad.
01:37:28.083,01:37:32.583,"to correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them."
01:37:32.625,01:37:36.125,My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
01:37:36.166,01:37:38.917,I'm here to erase Joel Barish.
01:37:38.959,01:37:41.500,What is this?
01:37:41.542,01:37:46.041,He's boring.
01:37:46.083,01:37:50.583,"I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now, and it's like he changed me."
01:37:50.625,01:37:53.542,I feel like I'm always pissy now. I don't like myself when I'm with him.
01:37:53.583,01:37:57.750,I don't like myself anymore.
01:37:57.792,01:38:00.250,"That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile."
01:38:00.291,01:38:03.583,"- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?"
01:38:03.625,01:38:06.208,I'm not doing anything.
01:38:06.250,01:38:09.125,- Are you screwing with me?
01:38:09.166,01:38:11.542,- You are screwing with me.
01:38:11.583,01:38:15.959,- You clearly are.
01:38:11.583,01:38:46.417,"- Look, let's just take a minute and-- Patrick, get the fuck away."
01:38:46.458,01:38:49.291,"Oh, sweetheart-- Get the fuck away from me!"
01:38:49.333,01:38:52.291,Can we talk about it?
01:39:24.458,01:39:26.834,Joel Barish.
01:39:26.875,01:39:29.625,"Hey, Clementine."
01:39:29.667,01:39:32.625,Nice to see you. Yeah.
01:39:34.375,01:39:35.959,Yeah.
01:39:36.000,01:39:37.709,Really very educated.
01:39:37.750,01:39:41.875,"I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated."
01:39:41.917,01:39:44.500,"I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?"
01:39:44.542,01:39:48.208,She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
01:39:48.250,01:39:51.542,Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
01:39:51.583,01:39:56.333,Sometimes I was embarrassed in public-- Hi.
01:39:56.375,01:39:59.083,library libary.
01:39:59.125,01:40:02.458,Libary. Libary.
01:40:02.500,01:40:04.625,Look what I found.
01:40:04.667,01:40:12.208,"a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane."
01:40:14.083,01:40:16.125,You made me look skinny.
01:40:16.166,01:40:18.125,"Amazing, burning meteorite..."
01:40:18.166,01:40:23.625,that'll carry you to another world where things are exciting.
01:40:23.667,01:40:26.166,But what you quickly learn is that...
01:40:26.208,01:40:29.125,it's really an elaborate ruse.
01:40:29.166,01:40:30.917,I'm sorry I yelled at you.
01:40:32.625,01:40:36.125,It's okay.
01:40:37.166,01:40:39.959,"But still, it seduces you."
01:40:40.000,01:40:42.375,I hate that I said mean things about you.
01:40:42.417,01:40:46.500,"- Let me turn this off, okay?"
01:40:47.875,01:40:50.166,Where's the real Clementine?
01:40:50.208,01:40:53.166,"I mean, the whole thing with the hair-- it's all bullshit."
01:40:53.208,01:40:55.917,- I really like your hair.
01:40:55.959,01:40:57.709,I really like your hair.
01:40:57.750,01:40:59.583,I do.
01:40:59.625,01:41:04.000,This is how you rebel?
01:41:04.041,01:41:05.417,Do you have any whiskey?
01:41:06.458,01:41:12.375,"No, I don't think her sex is... motivated."
01:41:12.417,01:41:15.333,I saw it clearly the last night we were together.
01:41:15.375,01:41:18.583,It wasn't sex.
01:41:18.625,01:41:22.375,Hey. Sorry.
01:41:22.417,01:41:26.875,The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her is to fuck 'em...
01:41:28.583,01:41:32.917,or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of 'em.
01:41:32.959,01:41:35.834,And she's so desperate and insecure...
01:41:35.875,01:41:40.417,"that she'll, sooner or later, go around and fuck everybody."
01:41:40.458,01:41:44.166,I don't do that.
01:41:44.208,01:41:46.834,- Because I don't.
01:41:46.875,01:41:49.500,Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.
01:41:49.542,01:41:53.333,- I'm so sorry.
01:41:53.375,01:41:57.917,I'm a little confused.
01:42:04.166,01:42:06.208,Um... bye.
01:42:06.250,01:42:08.792,Bye.
01:42:08.834,01:42:12.166,It was nice meeting you and all.
01:42:13.709,01:42:20.000,"What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger."
01:42:24.542,01:42:26.000,Wait.
01:42:28.542,01:42:29.709,What?
01:42:29.750,01:42:31.875,Just wait. Just wait.
01:42:31.917,01:42:35.792,I don't know.
01:42:50.208,01:42:53.041,Okay.
01:42:53.083,01:42:54.709,"I'm not a concept, Joel."
01:42:54.750,01:42:57.083,I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
01:42:57.125,01:43:01.250,- I'm not perfect.
01:43:01.291,01:43:04.542,But you will.
01:43:04.583,01:43:07.500,"You will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped..."
01:43:07.542,01:43:09.667,because that's what happens with me.
01:43:11.458,01:43:12.917,Okay.
01:43:16.792,01:43:18.166,Okay.
01:43:22.917,01:43:25.041,Okay.
