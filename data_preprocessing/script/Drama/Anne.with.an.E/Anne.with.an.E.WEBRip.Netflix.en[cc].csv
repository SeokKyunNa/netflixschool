00:01:28.046,00:01:31.174,You'll want to hurry and eat if you're to meet the train on time.
00:01:36.554,00:01:39.349,We made a practical decision. We'll just have to hope for the best.
00:01:40.058,00:01:42.936,"With any luck, Mrs. Spencer will have picked out a good one."
00:01:43.019,00:01:46.564,"A hard worker and obedient, like we asked for."
00:01:47.106,00:01:49.943,I couldn't tolerate a lazy boy or a sullen boy.
00:01:50.026,00:01:52.654,"No, I couldn't abide it and I wouldn't."
00:01:55.115,00:01:58.743,"In spite of all the worry, I'm relieved to know you'll have a regular hand about the place."
00:01:58.827,00:02:00.620,You can't buy loyalty.
00:02:03.081,00:02:05.208,You coming in sometime today?
00:02:21.724,00:02:24.102,"Matthew Cuthbert, you must be in a state."
00:02:24.185,00:02:26.980,Since when do you sit at the table without washing your hands?
00:02:29.274,00:02:32.277,Let's not forget you were the one convinced of this plan.
00:02:32.360,00:02:35.280,"You've been set on it since winter, so there's no point fretting now."
00:02:35.363,00:02:37.448,"Not that I disagree, because I don't."
00:02:43.913,00:02:46.666,Will you be ready to set off as soon as you're finished here?
00:02:46.749,00:02:48.084,I will.
00:02:48.793,00:02:51.629,Bet it won't take long for Rachel to come a-knocking.
00:02:51.713,00:02:55.592,Lord knows she's got a hunger for gossip like a person starved.
00:04:20.260,00:04:23.096,I told you to have their supper on the table a half-hour ago.
00:04:23.179,00:04:26.140,-She needs her diaper changed. -Did you milk the cow?
00:04:26.766,00:04:28.935,"-No. Not yet, but I-- -Give her to me!"
00:04:30.395,00:04:33.815,You want these children to starve to death? Do something right for a change.
00:04:33.898,00:04:37.777,You're more trouble than you're worth. Nothing but a miserable piece of trash!
00:04:38.987,00:04:42.615,Hurry up! We'll see what Mr. Hammond has to say about this when he gets home.
00:04:54.752,00:04:55.962,"Are you quite all right, dear?"
00:04:58.339,00:05:00.425,I like imagining better than remembering.
00:05:01.968,00:05:04.178,Why are the worst memories the most insistent?
00:05:04.262,00:05:06.431,I wouldn't know. Try to rest.
00:05:09.267,00:05:12.437,"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked..."
00:05:13.771,00:05:17.275,but your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt...
00:05:18.109,00:05:20.028,you would not be without friends.
00:05:20.945,00:05:23.156,"I love Jane Eyre, don't you?"
00:05:24.198,00:05:25.116,I never met her.
00:05:25.199,00:05:29.495,I'm glad you've woken. I have so many more questions for you about Green Gables.
00:05:29.579,00:05:31.080,I'm sure you do.
00:05:31.831,00:05:35.001,Why do you suppose neither of the Cuthberts ever married?
00:05:35.084,00:05:37.378,Did either of them have a tragical romance?
00:05:37.462,00:05:40.840,-It's none of our business. -But I'm bursting with curiosity!
00:05:41.507,00:05:43.051,Uh... shh.
00:06:31.432,00:06:33.643,"Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:06:38.564,00:06:39.398,Afternoon.
00:06:45.279,00:06:46.155,Sir.
00:07:02.964,00:07:06.134,A little girl? You didn't see her? She's just outside.
00:07:06.217,00:07:08.386,Wouldn't come in. Darndest thing.
00:07:09.011,00:07:13.808,But-- Said she preferred to sit outside because there was... What was it now?
00:07:14.475,00:07:17.437,More scope for the imagination. That was it.
00:07:17.520,00:07:21.315,"She's a case, I should say. I heard her talking to herself out there."
00:07:21.399,00:07:23.651,But I-I'm not expecting a girl.
00:07:23.734,00:07:26.696,It's a boy that I have come for.
00:07:27.613,00:07:29.824,Mrs. Spencer was to bring him over from the asylum.
00:07:29.907,00:07:32.577,"Well, Mrs. Spencer got off the train with that strange snippet."
00:07:32.660,00:07:33.995,Gave her into my charge.
00:07:34.078,00:07:35.997,Said you'd be along for her presently.
00:07:36.956,00:07:38.458,"Well, that's all I know about it."
00:07:38.541,00:07:41.252,I haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts.
00:07:41.335,00:07:42.420,I...
00:07:43.629,00:07:44.714,I don't understand.
00:07:44.797,00:07:49.969,"Well, I'm sure the girl will be only too happy to tell you every little detail of what happened."
00:07:53.598,00:07:54.932,Good day to you.
00:08:04.567,00:08:07.653,I suppose you are Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?
00:08:07.737,00:08:08.988,I'm very glad to see you.
00:08:09.071,00:08:13.826,"I was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming, and I was imagining all the things that might've happened to prevent you."
00:08:13.910,00:08:21.584,"I'd made up my mind that if you didn't come for me, I'd go down the track to that big wild cherry tree, and climb up into it and stay all night."
00:08:21.667,00:08:26.923,"I wouldn't be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a tree white with bloom in the moonshine, don't you think?"
00:08:32.178,00:08:35.181,I can also imagine that I'm already a disappointment to you.
00:08:37.350,00:08:41.103,"I'm aware that I'm not much to look at, but even though I'm thin, I'm very strong."
00:08:42.730,00:08:45.691,I want you to know that I'm forever grateful that you're adopting me.
00:08:47.860,00:08:50.196,"You're a sight for sore eyes, Mr. Cuthbert."
00:08:52.949,00:08:54.116,You best come along.
00:08:54.200,00:08:56.911,"-Uh, I'll take your bag. -Oh, I can carry it."
00:08:56.994,00:08:58.204,It isn't heavy.
00:08:58.287,00:09:01.332,"I've got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn't heavy."
00:09:01.415,00:09:05.086,"And if it isn't carried a certain way, it falls right open, so I'd better keep it."
00:09:05.169,00:09:07.380,I've come to know the exact knack of it.
00:09:09.715,00:09:13.386,I am ecstatic beyond measure that I'm going to belong to you and your sister.
00:09:13.469,00:09:17.473,Ecstatic. I've never belonged to anybody before.
00:09:17.557,00:09:20.977,"I mean, you and your sister are practically the stuff of fiction."
00:09:21.686,00:09:28.150,"Two hard-working decent people, lonely all their lives in their silent house, longing for the love of a child."
00:09:28.234,00:09:32.238,And I will strive to be just the best daughter that anybody could ever have.
00:09:32.947,00:09:34.699,I'm sure that I could do it.
00:09:35.366,00:09:38.244,"To be honest, I haven't had much experience at it."
00:09:38.327,00:09:41.372,"I'm not usually brought into the house to be a daughter, so..."
00:09:41.455,00:09:45.293,"you can well imagine what a blessing this is, and how much my heart is lifted."
00:09:47.086,00:10:02.226,"And I've given it a lot of thought, and I am determined that I shall be obedient and dutiful, and yet, yet lively enough so as to lighten up the place, after you've lived for so many years without the delights of a happy child and the scope of her imagination."
00:10:03.352,00:10:05.605,Have you always wanted a daughter?
00:10:06.689,00:10:08.774,Always in your heart of hearts?
00:10:08.858,00:10:13.696,I read once that a daughter is a little girl who grows up to be a friend.
00:10:15.948,00:10:19.285,"And it, it gives my heart a thrill to even say it aloud."
00:10:20.911,00:10:21.996,Oh...
00:10:22.413,00:10:24.040,"Oh, isn't she lovely?"
00:10:24.624,00:10:26.834,-What's her name? -Uh...
00:10:26.917,00:10:29.170,"That's, um... Mare."
00:10:29.253,00:10:30.588,She doesn't have a name?
00:10:31.631,00:10:33.841,But the right name is so important.
00:10:33.924,00:10:38.471,She looks to me like her name is Belle.
00:10:38.554,00:10:42.433,"Hello, Belle. You are a beauty, and I am sure we'll be great friends."
00:10:56.614,00:10:57.823,"Bye, tree!"
00:11:04.455,00:11:07.208,That cherry tree is my first friend here on the island.
00:11:08.042,00:11:11.087,"What did that cherry tree, all white and lacy, make you think of?"
00:11:13.714,00:11:15.966,"Well, now, um... I dunno."
00:11:17.885,00:11:20.096,A bride all in white with a misty veil.
00:11:20.179,00:11:22.723,"I've never seen one, but I imagine what she would look like."
00:11:22.807,00:11:26.310,I never expect to be a bride myself. I'm so homely.
00:11:26.394,00:11:28.062,Nobody would ever want to marry me.
00:11:28.145,00:11:29.939,Unless he was a foreign missionary.
00:11:30.022,00:11:32.608,I suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular.
00:11:33.692,00:11:37.238,But I do hope someday I shall have a white dress with beautiful puff sleeves.
00:11:37.321,00:11:40.324,That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss.
00:11:42.576,00:11:44.203,Am I talking too much?
00:11:45.746,00:11:48.874,"People are always telling me that I do, and it seems to cause aggravation."
00:11:48.958,00:11:51.085,"Would you rather I didn't talk? If you say so, I'll stop."
00:11:51.168,00:11:54.046,"I can stop when I make up my mind to it, although it's difficult."
00:11:57.591,00:11:58.717,I don't mind.
00:11:59.301,00:12:00.886,I'm so glad.
00:12:00.970,00:12:04.098,I know that you and I are gonna get along together just fine.
00:12:04.598,00:12:10.020,It's such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that children should be seen and not heard.
00:12:10.104,00:12:12.940,I've had that said to me a million times if I have once.
00:12:13.524,00:12:16.110,"People would laugh at me because I use big words, but..."
00:12:16.193,00:12:19.155,"but they're exciting and descriptive words, like..."
00:12:19.905,00:12:23.492,like enraptured and glorious.
00:12:23.576,00:12:27.329,"If you have big ideas, you have to use big words to express them, haven't you?"
00:12:28.831,00:12:32.084,Well... I suppose so.
00:12:32.168,00:12:33.961,For example...
00:12:34.879,00:12:39.133,I am enraptured by this glorious landscape!
00:12:39.216,00:12:41.886,Just careful now. Careful.
00:12:54.523,00:12:55.733,I've put the kettle on.
00:12:59.236,00:13:00.446,Won't you sit down?
00:13:03.616,00:13:06.619,I don't want to interrupt if you're expecting company.
00:13:06.702,00:13:09.997,"Oh, we've got plenty of time. Matthew won't be back for several hours."
00:13:11.081,00:13:14.126,I took quite a fright when I saw Matthew starting off today.
00:13:14.210,00:13:15.503,I can imagine.
00:13:15.586,00:13:21.091,"Well, I couldn't imagine what might cause him to leave his crop in the middle of the afternoon."
00:13:22.218,00:13:24.678,I was fearful he'd gone to call for the doctor.
00:13:24.762,00:13:27.348,"-Oh, I'm quite well. -Oh, what a relief."
00:13:34.230,00:13:40.277,it wouldn't make sense for Matthew to take the time to put on his best set of clothes had there been an emergency.
00:13:40.903,00:13:42.905,No. It wouldn't.
00:13:43.781,00:13:45.950,"No, indeed."
00:13:52.540,00:13:55.292,Matthew's gone to the train station at Bright River.
00:14:00.506,00:14:01.674,He's fetching a hired hand?
00:14:02.925,00:14:04.301,Yes and no.
00:14:05.719,00:14:10.099,"We're adopting a boy from the orphan asylum in Nova Scotia, and he's arriving today."
00:14:11.183,00:14:20.276,"-Matthew's gone to fetch him. -Marilla Cuthbert, if you had told me that Matthew was meeting a... kangaroo from Australia, I couldn't be more surprised."
00:14:20.359,00:14:21.610,An orphan boy?
00:14:22.194,00:14:25.281,What on earth put such a notion into your head?
00:14:26.323,00:14:28.075,Because I'm gonna tell you plain...
00:14:28.158,00:14:32.162,"you're doing a mighty foolish thing, a risky thing, that's what."
00:14:55.019,00:14:57.104,"Dreams don't often come true, do they?"
00:14:57.521,00:15:00.900,But just now I feel pretty nearly perfectly happy.
00:15:00.983,00:15:04.153,"Although I can't feel exactly perfectly happy because, well..."
00:15:04.236,00:15:06.155,what color would you call this?
00:15:08.324,00:15:10.242,"It's red, isn't it?"
00:15:10.868,00:15:13.245,"Yes, it's red."
00:15:13.329,00:15:15.539,Now you see why I can't be perfectly happy.
00:15:15.623,00:15:17.583,Nobody could who has red hair. It's...
00:15:18.667,00:15:20.044,my lifelong sorrow.
00:15:21.170,00:15:22.922,You don't know what you're getting.
00:15:23.005,00:15:27.927,"You're letting a... strange child into your house, and you don't know a thing about him."
00:15:28.510,00:15:39.980,"Why, only last week, I was reading in the paper how a man and his wife, uh, up west of the island, took an orphan boy out of the asylum, and he set fire to their home."
00:15:40.064,00:15:41.231,At night.
00:15:41.315,00:15:42.983,"Set it on purpose, Marilla."
00:15:43.609,00:15:45.819,And they nearly burnt to a crisp in their beds!
00:15:46.403,00:15:52.201,"Now, if you would have asked for my advice on this matter, -which you didn't do-- -Sugar?"
00:15:52.993,00:15:57.915,"I would have told you for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing, that's what!"
00:15:59.500,00:16:02.503,"I don't deny there's something in what you say, Rachel. I've..."
00:16:02.586,00:16:04.505,I've had some qualms myself.
00:16:05.297,00:16:06.173,How could you not?
00:16:07.424,00:16:10.761,"Matthew is getting on in years, and his heart's been bothering him."
00:16:10.844,00:16:12.054,A boy will be a great help.
00:16:13.722,00:16:17.476,It isn't as if he's coming from overseas or the States. He's from Nova Scotia.
00:16:18.143,00:16:19.979,Can't be much different than ourselves.
00:16:20.062,00:16:25.401,"Well, there is some comfort in that, knowing he's not some London street Arab."
00:16:25.484,00:16:26.902,Or some French ruffian.
00:16:29.405,00:16:30.572,"An orphan, Marilla."
00:16:31.865,00:16:33.784,Matthew's been terrible set on it.
00:16:33.867,00:16:36.161,"Well, I only hope and pray it works all right."
00:16:38.288,00:16:44.545,"Only don't say I didn't warn you if he burns Green Gables down, or puts strychnine in the well."
00:16:44.628,00:16:51.844,"I heard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child did just that, and the whole family died in fearful agonies."
00:16:51.927,00:16:53.887,Only it was a girl in that instant.
00:16:53.971,00:16:56.140,"Well, we're not getting a girl."
00:16:59.059,00:17:01.520,-What do they call this place? -The Avenue.
00:17:02.730,00:17:04.940,I suppose it is kind of pretty.
00:17:05.024,00:17:09.069,"Oh, pretty doesn't seem the right word to use. Nor beautiful, either."
00:17:09.153,00:17:10.237,They don't go far enough.
00:17:12.698,00:17:15.325,It's... wonderful.
00:17:16.326,00:17:17.703,Wonderful.
00:17:17.786,00:17:21.707,The first thing I ever saw that couldn't be improved upon by the imagination.
00:17:23.375,00:17:29.882,"Other people may call it The Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight."
00:17:38.599,00:17:39.975,I shall call it...
00:17:40.726,00:17:42.019,let me see...
00:17:43.353,00:17:45.731,the Lake of Shining Waters.
00:17:46.440,00:17:48.776,"Yes, that's the right name for it."
00:17:48.859,00:17:51.028,I-I know because of the thrill.
00:17:51.111,00:17:52.863,Do things ever give you a thrill?
00:17:54.114,00:17:55.866,"Uh, I don't rightly know."
00:17:56.366,00:17:58.243,There has to be something.
00:18:02.372,00:18:09.963,I suppose it kind of gives me a thrill to see those ugly white grubs spade up in the cucumber beds.
00:18:10.964,00:18:12.716,"Well, I suppose I can imagine that."
00:18:12.800,00:18:15.719,"I hate the look of them, and like to be rid of them."
00:18:16.345,00:18:18.180,"I suppose I gave Mrs. Hammond a thrill, then."
00:18:18.263,00:18:20.974,She was happy to be rid of me after her husband died.
00:18:21.058,00:18:22.768,Who's Mrs. Hammond?
00:18:22.851,00:18:26.313,I worked for her family taking care of the children for a few years.
00:18:26.396,00:18:27.523,She had eight.
00:18:28.357,00:18:31.610,It sure seems to make some people angry when they have so many children.
00:18:33.278,00:18:36.365,Mr. and Mrs. Hammond were certainly vexed all the time.
00:19:04.268,00:19:06.770,-Is anything the matter? -No. Nothing.
00:19:07.563,00:19:09.398,"I was, I was startled by the geese, is all."
00:19:11.108,00:19:13.110,Don't you just love them? The geese? I do.
00:19:13.694,00:19:16.071,They're a very romantical species of bird.
00:19:16.155,00:19:18.490,"Well, I wouldn't know about that."
00:19:19.533,00:19:21.451,Did you know they mate for life?
00:19:21.535,00:19:27.916,"They choose each other out of all the other geese in the world, and they stay together until death do they part."
00:19:29.459,00:19:30.794,"Well, now..."
00:19:31.962,00:19:33.922,"Uh, we're pretty near home."
00:19:34.006,00:19:35.507,Just another mile or so.
00:19:37.301,00:19:38.510,Home.
00:19:39.386,00:19:41.305,What a wonderful word.
00:19:55.152,00:20:01.074,"Every little while, this horrible sickening feeling would come over me, and I'd be so afraid that this was all a dream."
00:20:02.993,00:20:04.620,But I just had to one more time.
00:20:06.371,00:20:07.372,This is real.
00:20:08.081,00:20:11.168,Green Gables is real and we're home.
00:20:57.881,00:21:00.550,"Matthew Cuthbert, who's that?"
00:21:01.677,00:21:03.095,Where is the boy?
00:21:04.680,00:21:06.348,There wasn't any boy.
00:21:06.807,00:21:08.225,There was only her.
00:21:10.227,00:21:14.022,But there must have been a boy. We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy.
00:21:14.106,00:21:15.732,"Well, she didn't."
00:21:16.525,00:21:18.026,She brought her.
00:21:18.860,00:21:21.029,I asked the stationmaster.
00:21:21.113,00:21:22.447,I had to bring her home.
00:21:23.031,00:21:26.410,"She couldn't be left there, no matter where the mistake had come in."
00:21:29.830,00:21:31.915,-She's gotta go back. -You don't want me.
00:21:38.797,00:21:41.300,I might have known nobody would really want me.
00:21:42.259,00:21:45.345,"Oh, for heaven's sake, child! What are you doing on the ground?"
00:21:45.971,00:21:47.431,Now you listen here and stand up.
00:21:51.226,00:21:53.812,"-What do you make of this? -I, um..."
00:21:54.521,00:21:58.734,Because she's traveled a long way to be disappointed.
00:21:58.817,00:22:02.321,"Well, she shouldn't be here. You should never have brought her home."
00:22:09.244,00:22:11.913,Enough of this foolishness. Come along inside.
00:22:16.877,00:22:18.712,"Little girl, that's enough now."
00:22:20.297,00:22:23.008,Little girl? Little girl!
00:22:25.385,00:22:26.678,Little girl?
00:22:27.471,00:22:29.139,I wish I was anything but.
00:22:29.222,00:22:30.557,There's no point in crying.
00:22:30.640,00:22:32.768,"There's been a mistake, is all."
00:22:32.851,00:22:34.978,We're not gonna turn you out of doors tonight.
00:22:36.229,00:22:37.522,What is your name?
00:22:37.606,00:22:38.982,What does it matter?
00:22:39.483,00:22:42.194,I won't be here long enough for you to remember.
00:22:42.277,00:22:44.863,You will mind your manners and answer the question.
00:22:47.074,00:22:49.826,Please... call me Cordelia.
00:22:50.410,00:22:53.288,Call you Cordelia? Is that your name?
00:22:53.371,00:22:54.539,Or Penelope.
00:22:55.165,00:22:57.417,Penelope has a very tragical ring to it.
00:22:57.501,00:22:59.252,"What is your name, child?"
00:23:00.629,00:23:02.672,Couldn't you call me either of those?
00:23:07.886,00:23:09.429,My name is Anne.
00:23:10.305,00:23:11.848,Plain Anne.
00:23:13.141,00:23:14.976,Anne is a fine name.
00:23:15.477,00:23:16.520,A sensible name.
00:23:18.313,00:23:21.316,Could you please spell it with an E when you speak it?
00:23:21.399,00:23:23.527,Anne with an E looks much more distinguished.
00:23:24.528,00:23:26.071,"Very well, then."
00:23:26.154,00:23:29.741,"Anne, with an E, it's time to come inside."
00:23:29.825,00:23:31.368,Get yourself up now.
00:23:46.424,00:23:47.509,I knew it.
00:23:49.344,00:23:50.637,This is a lovely home.
00:23:52.806,00:23:56.351,Why didn't you tell me at the train station that you didn't want me?
00:23:56.434,00:23:58.812,Why didn't you just leave me there?
00:23:58.895,00:24:04.109,"If I hadn't seen the White Way of Delight or the Lake of Shining Waters, this wouldn't be so hard."
00:24:06.486,00:24:10.073,It's just a conversation we had on the road.
00:24:12.033,00:24:13.243,I'll put the mare in.
00:24:19.875,00:24:22.210,Lay it and your bag on the bench.
00:24:26.548,00:24:29.718,I simply don't understand. Were there no boys at the asylum?
00:24:32.179,00:24:38.143,"But Mrs. Spencer said distinctly that you wanted a girl about my age, and the matron thought that I would do."
00:24:38.977,00:24:43.148,This is what comes of sending word and not going ourselves. Follow me.
00:24:43.231,00:24:44.316,Don't dally.
00:24:44.816,00:24:47.819,"I'm sorry to disappoint you, but there's nothing to be done."
00:24:47.903,00:24:50.655,We want a boy to help Matthew with the farm work.
00:24:51.239,00:24:53.825,A girl would be of no use to us. Do you understand?
00:24:54.701,00:24:57.579,-I can't say that I do. -I beg your pardon?
00:24:57.662,00:25:01.750,"I don't mean any disrespect, but couldn't I do the farm chores even though I'm a girl?"
00:25:01.833,00:25:04.211,"That's not the way of things, and you know it."
00:25:04.294,00:25:05.295,But couldn't I?
00:25:05.378,00:25:09.549,"I'm as strong as a boy, and I prefer to be outdoors instead of cooped up in a kitchen."
00:25:10.175,00:25:11.843,I don't understand the conundrum.
00:25:11.927,00:25:16.723,"For example, what if suddenly there were no boys in the world?"
00:25:16.806,00:25:18.391,-None at all? -Fiddlesticks.
00:25:18.475,00:25:24.981,It doesn't make sense that girls aren't allowed to do farm work when girls can do anything a boy can do and more.
00:25:25.607,00:25:30.111,Do you consider yourself to be delicate and incapable? Because I certainly don't.
00:25:31.071,00:25:33.949,"Anyway, since I'm here now, couldn't you consider it?"
00:25:34.032,00:25:34.908,I could not.
00:25:35.617,00:25:37.744,And put those fool notions out of your head.
00:25:47.712,00:25:49.923,"Oh, good gracious, child! What's happened here?"
00:25:54.970,00:25:58.848,I was pinching myself a lot today to prove that this was all true.
00:26:14.739,00:26:16.199,"Well, you're not eating at all."
00:26:17.033,00:26:19.452,I can't. I'm sorry.
00:26:19.995,00:26:21.663,I'm in the depths of despair.
00:26:22.914,00:26:25.041,Can you eat when you're in the depths of despair?
00:26:25.917,00:26:29.629,"I've never been in the depths of despair, so I can't say."
00:26:30.797,00:26:33.675,"Well, did you ever imagine that you were in the depths of despair?"
00:26:35.093,00:26:36.553,"No, I didn't."
00:26:36.636,00:26:39.097,"Well, it's a very uncomfortable feeling, indeed."
00:26:40.181,00:26:45.186,"When you try to eat, a big lump comes right up into your throat, and you can't swallow anything."
00:26:46.438,00:26:48.106,Not even if it was a chocolate caramel.
00:26:49.816,00:26:53.611,"I had chocolate caramel once two years ago, and it was simply delicious."
00:26:54.988,00:26:59.159,I hope you won't be offended that I can't eat. Everything is extremely nice.
00:27:01.119,00:27:02.203,I guess she's just tired.
00:27:02.829,00:27:04.664,"Best put her to bed, hmm?"
00:27:06.791,00:27:08.793,Fetch your bag and follow me.
00:27:47.415,00:27:49.751,I'll come back in a few minutes for the candle.
00:28:27.330,00:28:28.373,Good night.
00:28:29.666,00:28:36.256,How can you call it a good night when you know this must be the very worst night I've ever had?
00:28:54.441,00:28:56.317,"Oh, that is a filthy habit!"
00:28:57.694,00:28:59.612,Daresay a man's got a right to smoke...
00:29:00.530,00:29:02.365,when his mind's burdened.
00:29:02.449,00:29:04.909,"I daresay yours is, too."
00:29:04.993,00:29:07.454,"Yes, this is certainly a fine kettle of fish."
00:29:08.413,00:29:11.583,"One of us will have to drive over and see Mrs. Spencer tomorrow, for certain."
00:29:12.250,00:29:13.918,The girl will have to be sent back.
00:29:15.462,00:29:16.629,"Yep, I suppose so."
00:29:17.338,00:29:19.007,You suppose so? Don't you know it?
00:29:19.090,00:29:22.719,"Well, now, it... seems a pity."
00:29:23.344,00:29:24.679,"I mean, to send her back?"
00:29:26.055,00:29:27.640,She's so set on staying.
00:29:27.724,00:29:31.728,"Matthew Cuthbert, do you mean to say you think we ought to keep her?"
00:29:33.354,00:29:35.106,"No, no, no. I-I-I..."
00:29:36.483,00:29:38.860,"-No, I suppose not. -I should say not!"
00:29:40.111,00:29:41.696,What good would she be to us?
00:29:43.782,00:29:45.784,We might be some good to her.
00:29:46.367,00:29:48.661,I believe that child has bewitched you.
00:29:48.745,00:29:51.581,I can see it plain as plain you want to keep her.
00:29:53.249,00:29:55.460,She's a real interesting kind of person.
00:29:56.211,00:29:57.462,That's one way to put it.
00:29:57.545,00:30:01.299,"You should have heard her talk, coming from the station."
00:30:01.382,00:30:04.385,"Well, she can talk fast enough, and it's nothing in her favor."
00:30:05.637,00:30:07.514,I don't mind the conversation.
00:30:07.597,00:30:09.974,I don't like children who have so much to say.
00:30:11.184,00:30:13.770,There's something I don't understand about her.
00:30:13.853,00:30:17.857,"No, she's gotta be dispatched straightway back where she came from."
00:30:19.692,00:30:24.113,"I could hire a boy to help me, and, uh, she could be company for you."
00:30:24.197,00:30:27.617,I'm not suffering for company. And I'm not gonna keep her.
00:30:30.370,00:30:34.624,"Well, now... it's just as you say, of course."
00:30:41.589,00:30:42.715,I'm going to bed.
00:31:31.472,00:31:33.391,I accept your token offering.
00:31:35.268,00:31:43.651,"Had I a book, I would press these sacred blossoms between its pages, so that I could be forever reminded of this treasured moment."
00:31:44.903,00:31:46.154,Nevertheless...
00:31:47.780,00:31:52.201,"I, Princess Cordelia..."
00:31:54.370,00:31:56.915,shall cherish this gift always.
00:32:09.385,00:32:10.929,It's time you were dressed.
00:32:13.598,00:32:17.477,I was imagining that this morning was different than what it is.
00:32:18.061,00:32:26.736,"I was making believe that I was a beautiful princess, and that this was my sacred chamber, high in a tall stone spire."
00:32:26.819,00:32:28.237,Never mind your chatter.
00:32:29.572,00:32:30.740,Sorry.
00:32:32.116,00:32:38.581,It's just that your gable room and your lovely old cherry tree provide such scope for the imagination.
00:32:39.958,00:32:46.089,I've also been wishing with all my might that you'd tell me that you'd decided that I could stay.
00:32:49.133,00:32:51.052,Pack that inside and come downstairs.
00:32:51.135,00:32:53.888,We'll be driving to see Mrs. Spencer after breakfast.
00:34:10.256,00:34:12.008,Put that down at once!
00:34:14.385,00:34:15.928,-Did you take anything? -No!
00:34:16.888,00:34:18.014,I was only memorizing.
00:34:19.932,00:34:20.933,Let me see.
00:34:28.441,00:34:30.401,Stop your snooping and come to breakfast.
00:34:43.790,00:34:47.794,The world doesn't seem such a howling wilderness as it did last night.
00:34:50.421,00:34:53.674,"I'm glad it's a pretty morning, so we won't be driving back in the rain."
00:34:53.758,00:34:55.927,That would be extremely difficult to bear.
00:34:57.345,00:35:03.101,"It's all very well to read sorrowful stories, and imagine yourself living through them heroically, but..."
00:35:04.185,00:35:05.895,it's not so easy when you're actually woeful.
00:35:05.978,00:35:07.814,"Oh, for pity's sake, hold your tongue."
00:35:08.773,00:35:10.399,You talk entirely too much.
00:35:10.483,00:35:11.567,"Yes, ma'am."
00:35:15.279,00:35:20.159,"Just so's you know, I sent word to see if that French boy is available through harvest."
00:35:23.037,00:35:25.832,-Gracious me! -I can milk a cow and split wood.
00:35:25.915,00:35:29.585,"I can wash clothes, iron, dust, sweep and so many other things."
00:35:29.669,00:35:31.462,There is no end to what I could accomplish.
00:35:31.546,00:35:34.382,"I will take care of these dishes for you, Miss Cuthbert. You will see."
00:35:34.465,00:35:35.508,I'll do them right.
00:35:37.635,00:35:40.763,Be careful with the kettle. It's very hot. Use both hands.
00:35:43.724,00:35:47.145,I see it clear now. This very idea was folly.
00:35:47.228,00:35:49.105,You can't make up a family.
00:35:49.188,00:35:50.731,Only kin is kin.
00:36:02.076,00:36:06.706,Surely you'll be needing Anne more than ever since your husband's passing.
00:36:08.457,00:36:10.793,"I'm moving to my sister's, and I got no reason to take her."
00:36:10.877,00:36:14.172,-We're overcrowded as it is. -I don't need another mouth to feed.
00:36:18.384,00:36:20.595,-Please don't leave me here. -You're not kin.
00:36:21.387,00:36:24.557,"I got enough kin. You're taking her back, and that's final."
00:36:42.992,00:36:44.619,"Oh, you'll never keep me now."
00:36:45.494,00:36:46.787,I was never going to keep you.
00:36:58.591,00:36:59.425,Anne...
00:37:00.176,00:37:02.762,"-Bye, Mr. Cuthbert. -I..."
00:37:03.554,00:37:06.682,I didn't say I'd hire a boy to get rid of you.
00:37:07.475,00:37:09.644,It was in hopes that you could stay.
00:37:13.814,00:37:14.649,Thank you.
00:37:16.442,00:37:18.194,I'll never forget you.
00:37:18.277,00:37:19.654,You take care now...
00:37:21.197,00:37:22.615,Anne with an E.
00:37:31.249,00:37:33.084,My brother is a ridiculous man.
00:37:33.167,00:37:34.627,I think he's lovely.
00:37:35.211,00:37:38.256,"He's ever so sympathetic, and he didn't seem to mind how much I talked."
00:37:38.339,00:37:39.757,"In fact, he seemed to like it."
00:37:39.840,00:37:43.010,I felt he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him.
00:37:43.094,00:37:45.096,"You're both queer enough, that's for sure."
00:37:46.931,00:37:48.933,I've made up my mind to enjoy this drive.
00:37:49.016,00:37:53.771,It's been my experience you can nearly always enjoy something if you make up your mind firmly that you will.
00:37:54.605,00:37:57.441,"Of course, you must make up your mind firmly."
00:37:57.525,00:37:59.944,I believe this is something that you and I have in common.
00:38:18.671,00:38:21.132,"They're the most carefree of all the birds, don't you think?"
00:38:24.218,00:38:26.721,Look. Wild roses!
00:38:27.138,00:38:30.933,"Isn't pink just the most bewitching color? I love it, but I can't wear it."
00:38:31.267,00:38:34.395,"Redheaded people can't wear pink, not even in the imagination."
00:38:35.271,00:38:39.859,"Know of anybody whose hair was red when she was younger, but got to be another color when she grew up?"
00:38:39.942,00:38:41.110,I shouldn't think it likely.
00:38:42.987,00:38:44.447,There's another hope gone.
00:38:45.781,00:38:48.534,My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.
00:38:49.160,00:38:50.578,I read that sentence in a book once.
00:38:50.661,00:38:53.998,I say it to comfort myself whenever I'm disappointed in anything.
00:38:54.623,00:38:57.084,"I don't see where the comforting comes in, myself."
00:38:57.668,00:39:01.839,"Because it sounds so romantic, as if I were a heroine in a storybook."
00:39:08.471,00:39:13.517,"But in a household with so much to attend to, the children, the cooking, the chores, it just wasn't an option."
00:39:18.230,00:39:21.150,Is there a reason why Green Gables is so secluded?
00:39:23.027,00:39:25.654,My family wasn't inclined toward idle chatter.
00:39:31.535,00:39:34.121,You can't begrudge God for bringing them home.
00:39:34.205,00:39:35.247,I suppose not.
00:39:35.998,00:39:37.208,You suppose not?
00:39:39.085,00:39:41.128,Why is it you find yourself an orphan?
00:39:41.212,00:39:43.130,"Well, it happened when I was an infant."
00:39:43.214,00:39:46.425,I'd like to know the circumstances if you've a mind to tell them.
00:39:47.176,00:39:48.886,I don't mind telling stories.
00:39:49.887,00:39:56.644,"Somewhere in a far-off land, in a place whose name I do not care to remember, a gentleman lived not long ago."
00:39:56.727,00:40:04.110,"One of those with a lance, and an ancient shield on a shelf who keeps a skinny nag and a greyhound for racing-- -How dare you! -What?"
00:40:04.193,00:40:05.403,Do you take me for a fool?
00:40:05.486,00:40:07.905,"Well, it's just a much better story than mine."
00:40:07.988,00:40:10.533,"I didn't ask for any story, I asked for yours."
00:40:11.158,00:40:13.577,"If you can't tell the truth, then I have no time for you."
00:40:13.661,00:40:17.873,"If you let me tell you what I imagine about myself, you'll find it ever so much more interesting."
00:40:17.957,00:40:21.001,Wishing something is different than it is will not make it so!
00:40:23.671,00:40:25.506,Truer words were never spoken.
00:40:29.218,00:40:32.263,My parents were Walter and Bertha Shirley.
00:40:32.888,00:40:36.767,"They were newlyweds, and they were poor as church mice."
00:40:38.352,00:40:40.896,They died of a fever when I was three months old.
00:40:41.397,00:40:44.525,"So I've been earning my keep for as long as I can remember, and..."
00:40:45.901,00:40:50.114,"I suppose I was lucky that I was placed out, instead of staying in the asylum."
00:40:52.074,00:40:53.617,I never understood it.
00:40:55.327,00:41:00.166,"If children are such a burden, then why do people have so many of them?"
00:41:02.585,00:41:06.672,"Nevertheless, it's a shame I'll never have the opportunity."
00:41:07.756,00:41:08.757,What do you mean?
00:41:10.593,00:41:11.510,To be one.
00:41:19.935,00:41:21.020,Anne!
00:41:23.230,00:41:25.858,No! Go home! Go home!
00:41:28.110,00:41:29.403,"Oh, my Lord!"
00:41:30.529,00:41:31.780,Are you all right?
00:41:32.406,00:41:33.866,"-Shh. -Oh, dear Lord!"
00:41:33.949,00:41:36.660,"-I'm fine. Here you are. Shh. -Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:41:36.744,00:41:38.621,"It's all right. It's all right, Belle."
00:41:38.704,00:41:40.873,"There is no need to worry anymore, Belle."
00:41:40.956,00:41:43.334,-Belle? -That's her name.
00:41:50.674,00:41:52.718,-You're sure you're all right? -Mm-hmm.
00:41:59.308,00:42:00.935,You were very level-headed.
00:42:01.519,00:42:02.686,I'm used to a ruckus.
00:42:21.956,00:42:26.710,"My, you're the last folks I was looking for today, but I'm real glad to see you."
00:42:27.419,00:42:29.004,"And how are you doing, dear Anne?"
00:42:29.547,00:42:31.048,"I'm well enough, thank you."
00:42:31.840,00:42:33.259,"What brings you by, Miss Cuthbert?"
00:42:33.342,00:42:37.012,"Well, the fact is, Mrs. Spencer, there's been a queer mistake somewhere."
00:42:37.096,00:42:38.931,I've come over to see where it is.
00:42:40.099,00:42:44.061,Matthew and I sent word for you to bring us a boy from the asylum.
00:42:44.144,00:42:47.106,We told your brother Robert to tell you we wanted a boy.
00:42:47.189,00:42:49.149,"Marilla Cuthbert, you don't say so!"
00:42:49.733,00:42:52.945,But Robert sent word through his daughter Nancy that you wanted a girl.
00:42:54.238,00:42:56.490,"Oh, that Nancy is a terrible flighty thing."
00:42:56.574,00:42:58.867,I've often had to scold her for her heedlessness.
00:42:59.618,00:43:01.078,I'm dreadfully sorry about this.
00:43:01.161,00:43:02.538,It was our own fault.
00:43:02.621,00:43:07.418,"We should have come to you ourselves, and not left an important message to be handed on by word of mouth."
00:43:07.960,00:43:11.964,"However, the mistake has been made, and the only thing to do is to set it right."
00:43:12.423,00:43:15.009,"I suppose the asylum will take her back, won't they?"
00:43:15.884,00:43:19.305,"I suppose, but it might not be necessary to return her."
00:43:19.930,00:43:27.104,"My neighbor, Mrs. Blewett, was just saying to me she's overburdened by her large family, and she wishes she'd sent for a girl to help."
00:43:27.688,00:43:29.106,Anne will do nicely.
00:43:29.189,00:43:31.442,I call this positively providential.
00:43:31.525,00:43:33.110,We'll call on her and see.
00:43:33.193,00:43:34.361,I'm sure she'll agree.
00:43:38.282,00:43:42.161,-How old are you and what's your name? -Anne Shirley. I'm just 13.
00:43:42.244,00:43:45.831,Hmm. You don't look as if there's much to you. But you're wiry.
00:43:46.749,00:43:49.251,"I don't know, but the wiry ones are the best after all."
00:43:50.377,00:43:53.172,"If I take you, you'll do as I say, and speak when spoken to."
00:43:53.797,00:43:55.341,I don't suffer no backtalk.
00:43:55.424,00:43:57.676,"If I find you lacking, you'll know the toe of my boot."
00:43:57.760,00:44:00.137,"I expect you to earn your keep, and no mistake."
00:44:00.220,00:44:02.848,I'm at my wits' end with this one. He'll be the death of me.
00:44:06.560,00:44:07.645,That's a colic cry.
00:44:13.442,00:44:15.069,And gripe water helps.
00:44:16.487,00:44:19.239,-Anne has worked for large families. -And work she will.
00:44:19.865,00:44:21.575,This ain't no charity house.
00:44:21.659,00:44:23.869,"I suppose I can take her off your hands, Miss Cuthbert."
00:44:23.952,00:44:25.329,"If you like, I can take her now."
00:44:29.208,00:44:30.626,"W-Well, I-I don't know."
00:44:30.709,00:44:35.381,I... I didn't say Matthew and I had absolutely decided we wouldn't keep her.
00:44:35.464,00:44:39.635,I... I just came over to find out how the mistake had occurred.
00:44:40.260,00:44:43.764,"I'd better take her home again, and talk it over with my brother."
00:44:43.847,00:44:46.975,I ought not to decide on anything without consulting him.
00:44:48.018,00:44:51.063,"If we make up our minds not to keep her, we'll send her over to you."
00:44:51.688,00:44:55.067,"Otherwise, you can assume that she'll be staying with us."
00:44:56.068,00:44:57.569,"Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?"
00:44:58.237,00:45:00.489,-I suppose it'll have to. -Very well.
00:45:01.990,00:45:02.825,Good day.
00:45:08.831,00:45:14.503,"Oh, Miss Cuthbert, did you really say that perhaps you'd let me stay at Green Gables, or did I only imagine that you did?"
00:45:14.586,00:45:17.005,"Yes, I did say that and no more."
00:45:17.089,00:45:21.885,"But it isn't decided yet, and perhaps we'll conclude that Mrs. Blewett should take you after all."
00:45:22.344,00:45:25.139,"Well, I'd rather go back to the asylum than live with her."
00:45:28.725,00:45:31.687,I keep expecting her to chase after us on a broomstick.
00:45:32.354,00:45:35.315,I would like you to hold your tongue on the ride home.
00:45:35.983,00:45:37.484,I've got plenty to think about.
00:46:01.341,00:46:05.429,I'll thank you to keep your questions to yourself till we can speak in private.
00:46:05.512,00:46:08.557,"Run along inside. Put your bag upstairs, and put the kettle on."
00:46:08.640,00:46:09.933,"Yes, Miss Cuthbert."
00:46:13.437,00:46:15.481,"Oh, wipe that silly grin off your face!"
00:46:22.404,00:46:24.448,Trouble is I don't know about keeping her.
00:46:25.491,00:46:26.867,She's an interesting little thing.
00:46:26.950,00:46:29.369,It'd be more to the point if she was a useful little thing.
00:46:30.078,00:46:33.707,I propose we give her a one-week trial to see how she behaves.
00:46:33.790,00:46:35.584,She has five days.
00:46:35.667,00:46:38.045,"I'll need a lot of convincing, that's for certain."
00:46:40.589,00:46:42.174,"Oh, for heaven's sake!"
00:46:46.803,00:46:51.642,I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off.
00:46:51.725,00:46:54.853,"That is a very untidy habit, and I can't allow it."
00:46:55.437,00:46:58.774,"You must fold your clothing neatly, and place it on the chair."
00:46:59.358,00:47:01.693,I haven't any use for little girls who aren't neat.
00:47:02.236,00:47:06.114,I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn't think about my clothes at all.
00:47:06.490,00:47:07.991,I'll fold them nicely tonight.
00:47:08.325,00:47:10.994,"Although, I have been known to forget."
00:47:11.078,00:47:13.497,I'm usually in such a hurry to finally get to bed.
00:47:13.580,00:47:16.166,"Well, you'll have to remember if you're gonna stay here."
00:47:17.876,00:47:20.045,"You understand that you're on trial, yes?"
00:47:20.671,00:47:21.547,Yes.
00:47:21.964,00:47:23.882,A decision will be made in one week.
00:47:25.717,00:47:29.263,Now... say your prayers and get into bed.
00:47:29.346,00:47:30.430,I never say any prayers.
00:47:31.765,00:47:32.766,What?
00:47:33.934,00:47:37.938,"Well, I said them at the asylum Sunday School. I liked the catechism."
00:47:41.400,00:47:43.569,Infinite and unchangeable.
00:47:43.652,00:47:46.780,"It's not quite poetry, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn't it?"
00:47:47.406,00:47:51.201,"We're not talking about poetry, Anne, we're talking about prayers."
00:47:51.910,00:47:55.372,Don't you know it's a terrible wicked thing not to say your prayers every night?
00:47:55.455,00:47:58.750,I'm sorry. I-I-I was never taught to say them.
00:47:58.834,00:48:01.378,You must say your prayers while you're under my roof.
00:48:01.461,00:48:03.005,Of course. If you want me to.
00:48:03.088,00:48:04.590,I'd do anything to oblige you.
00:48:10.929,00:48:12.097,You must kneel down.
00:48:16.184,00:48:18.061,Why must people kneel down to pray?
00:48:18.145,00:48:20.939,"If I really wanted to pray, I'll tell you what I'd do."
00:48:22.399,00:48:26.194,I'd go into a great big field all alone...
00:48:27.154,00:48:36.955,"or into the deep, deep woods, and I'd look up into the sky, up up up, into that lovely blue sky without end..."
00:48:37.706,00:48:40.500,and I would just feel a prayer.
00:48:43.128,00:48:45.464,"Well, I'm ready. What am I to say?"
00:48:45.881,00:48:48.133,You're old enough to pray for yourself.
00:48:49.551,00:48:52.346,Just thank God for your blessings...
00:48:52.888,00:48:55.891,and ask Him humbly for the things that you want.
00:48:56.516,00:48:57.726,I'll do my best.
00:48:59.853,00:49:02.022,Gracious heavenly Father...
00:49:03.065,00:49:06.693,"That's what ministers say in church, so I suppose it's all right for private prayer?"
00:49:06.777,00:49:08.236,Hmm.
00:49:11.990,00:49:13.992,Gracious heavenly Father...
00:49:15.661,00:49:20.082,I thank Thee for the White Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters...
00:49:20.707,00:49:23.669,and for dear Belle and the lovely Snow Queen.
00:49:24.378,00:49:27.047,I'm really extremely grateful for them.
00:49:27.881,00:49:31.343,And that's all the blessings I can think of just now to thank Thee for.
00:49:32.094,00:49:39.601,"And as for the things I want, they're so numerous that it would take me a great deal of time to name them all, so I shall only mention the two most important."
00:49:41.061,00:49:42.979,Please let me stay at Green Gables.
00:49:43.939,00:49:46.274,Please let me be good-looking when I grow up.
00:49:47.442,00:49:50.278,"Yours respectfully, Anne Shirley."
00:49:55.951,00:49:57.411,That'll do for now.
00:49:58.036,00:49:59.454,"Get into bed, child."
00:50:03.041,00:50:08.672,"Oh, I just realized, I should have said amen in place of yours respectfully the way ministers do."
00:50:09.631,00:50:11.842,Do you suppose it'll make any difference?
00:50:11.925,00:50:13.468,I don't suppose it will.
00:50:13.552,00:50:17.889,"As God is my witness, I will do everything in my earthly power to make you want to keep me."
00:50:17.973,00:50:18.974,Good night.
00:50:19.057,00:50:21.435,"God, give me strength to succeed in my quest!"
00:50:21.518,00:50:23.186,That will do.
00:50:23.270,00:50:25.689,Sorry. I quite like praying.
00:50:26.982,00:50:28.692,"Well, it's time to say good night."
00:50:34.573,00:50:35.407,Good night.
00:50:54.468,00:50:56.720,That girl's next door to a perfect heathen.
00:51:01.349,00:51:04.019,God only knows what we're getting ourselves into.
00:51:16.573,00:51:17.532,Anne!
00:51:40.847,00:51:42.390,-She's gone! -Gone?
00:51:43.099,00:51:44.935,I'll check the silverware.
00:51:50.232,00:51:52.275,Eggs! That's one chore done!
00:51:52.901,00:51:56.238,"And now I've met all the chickens, so you don't need to make any introductions!"
00:51:56.321,00:51:59.241,I've been up since before the sun. I was too excited to sleep.
00:51:59.825,00:52:02.327,And I wanted to start proving to you that I should stay.
00:52:02.953,00:52:04.955,"It's so easy to love Green Gables, isn't it?"
00:52:06.373,00:52:08.124,I'll let the milkers out to graze.
00:52:08.208,00:52:09.626,I'll have breakfast on soon.
00:52:10.293,00:52:12.671,-May I take these blossoms up to my room? -No!
00:52:12.754,00:52:15.715,You don't want your room or your person cluttered up with flowers.
00:52:15.799,00:52:17.884,You should have left them on the tree.
00:52:17.968,00:52:22.055,"I felt that way, too. I shouldn't shorten their lovely lives by picking them."
00:52:22.138,00:52:24.808,"I mean, I wouldn't want to be picked if I were a blossom."
00:52:25.225,00:52:27.143,Wouldn't it be lovely to be a blossom?
00:52:27.727,00:52:29.896,"Yesterday, you wanted to be a seagull."
00:52:37.988,00:52:39.781,It's lovely.
00:52:39.865,00:52:43.577,"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name!"
00:52:45.704,00:52:47.122,It's like a line of music.
00:52:47.205,00:52:49.499,Just get on with the business of learning it.
00:52:50.709,00:52:52.586,"Our Father, who art in heaven..."
00:52:52.669,00:52:58.049,"Regardless of the outcome here, you should have something to wear besides that flimsy bit of business."
00:52:59.509,00:53:02.762,I have a leftover piece of cotton on a bolt that may do nicely.
00:53:07.183,00:53:08.935,You're going to make me a dress?
00:53:09.019,00:53:11.563,You need something suitable that fits you.
00:53:11.646,00:53:12.898,A new dress!
00:53:12.981,00:53:14.983,"Well, I've never had a new dress, not ever!"
00:53:15.567,00:53:18.528,I can't wait to have puff sleeves and ever so many flounces!
00:53:19.029,00:53:21.448,"Think you can adorn it with lace at the cuff and neckline, too?"
00:53:21.531,00:53:23.992,I don't believe in frills or flounces.
00:53:24.075,00:53:27.704,But surely you don't mind puff sleeves? All the girls are wearing them.
00:53:28.371,00:53:30.040,Puff sleeves are divine.
00:53:30.624,00:53:33.043,-Waste of fabric. -Oh.
00:53:33.752,00:53:39.424,"Well, I-I'm sure if it's a lovely azure blue or willow green, I'm sure I won't mind if it's..."
00:53:40.592,00:53:41.676,plain.
00:53:41.760,00:53:43.386,You're a vain one and no mistake.
00:53:44.054,00:53:46.097,Brown is a very sensible color.
00:53:47.265,00:53:49.976,"I'll need your dress, so I can use it for a pattern."
00:53:50.060,00:53:52.020,Let's take these things off now.
00:53:52.896,00:53:54.564,"Thank you, Miss Cuthbert."
00:53:54.648,00:53:57.150,I've very grateful to have something new. Really I am.
00:53:58.193,00:53:59.986,I'm sure I can imagine it's fashionable.
00:54:04.032,00:54:07.702,"If it looks just like this one, it shouldn't take you any time at all."
00:54:08.995,00:54:11.039,You run along now and learn the prayer.
00:54:12.082,00:54:13.458,"Yes, Miss Cuthbert."
00:54:14.209,00:54:17.420,"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy..."
00:54:18.463,00:54:20.131,Puff sleeves!
00:54:28.014,00:54:30.225,"-Morning, Marilla. -Morning, Rachel."
00:54:31.476,00:54:32.769,I brought you some scones.
00:54:32.852,00:54:36.773,"I felt for sure you wouldn't have time for baking, what with all the hubbub."
00:54:36.856,00:54:37.857,Thank you.
00:54:38.775,00:54:40.777,"I'll just come in and sit a spell, shall I?"
00:54:41.736,00:54:42.737,Catch my breath.
00:54:50.870,00:54:54.040,I've been hearing some surprising things about you and Matthew.
00:54:54.124,00:54:57.293,I don't suppose you're any more surprised than I am myself.
00:54:58.044,00:55:00.130,What an incredible mistake.
00:55:04.634,00:55:06.261,Couldn't you have just sent her back?
00:55:06.344,00:55:07.637,We may yet.
00:55:08.430,00:55:10.390,"But for now, she's here on trial."
00:55:11.725,00:55:13.476,-Trial? -One week.
00:55:13.977,00:55:16.521,Matthew is quite set on keeping her.
00:55:16.604,00:55:21.359,"And I'll admit she's a bright little thing, but I'll need a great deal more convincing."
00:55:22.152,00:55:24.404,"I know it by heart, Miss Cuthbert!"
00:55:25.071,00:55:29.242,"Anne, this is our neighbor, Mrs. Lynde."
00:55:30.243,00:55:34.622,"Well, they didn't pick you for your looks, that's sure and certain."
00:55:37.417,00:55:39.586,"She's terribly skinny and homely, Marilla."
00:55:45.300,00:55:46.843,Did you ever see such freckles?
00:55:47.510,00:55:50.430,"And hair as red as carrots! Dear, dear me."
00:55:53.975,00:55:56.352,"-I hate you, I hate you, I hate you! -Anne!"
00:55:56.436,00:55:58.021,How dare you call me skinny and ugly!
00:55:58.646,00:56:00.982,And how dare you call me freckled and redheaded!
00:56:01.066,00:56:03.276,"You are a rude, unfeeling woman!"
00:56:03.359,00:56:04.569,Well!
00:56:04.652,00:56:07.072,How would you like to have such things said about you?
00:56:07.155,00:56:13.828,"H-How would you like to be told that you're fat and clumsy, and that you probably hadn't a spark of imagination in you?"
00:56:14.454,00:56:17.040,And I don't care if I hurt your feelings by saying so.
00:56:17.123,00:56:19.667,I hope I hurt them!
00:56:19.751,00:56:23.671,Because you have hurt my feelings worse than they have ever been hurt before!
00:56:28.343,00:56:29.844,Anne!
00:56:32.097,00:56:34.599,Come back here! Anne!
00:56:46.486,00:56:47.529,Well!
00:56:48.238,00:56:49.447,I never.
00:56:50.490,00:56:52.450,It's a good thing you can send her back.
00:56:52.534,00:56:54.536,I wouldn't envy you the job of bringing that up.
00:56:54.619,00:56:56.621,You shouldn't have twitted her about her looks.
00:56:57.580,00:56:58.873,Marilla Cuthbert.
00:56:59.666,00:57:06.548,You don't mean to tell me that you are upholding her in such a terrible display of temper as we've just seen?
00:57:06.631,00:57:08.758,I am not trying to excuse her.
00:57:09.676,00:57:13.429,"She has been very naughty, and I'll have to give her a talking-to about it."
00:57:13.972,00:57:18.101,But we must make allowances for her. She's never been taught what is right.
00:57:18.518,00:57:20.061,And you were too hard on her.
00:57:20.937,00:57:22.021,Well...
00:57:23.022,00:57:26.776,I can see now I'm gonna have to be very careful what I say after this...
00:57:27.610,00:57:33.950,"since the fine feelings of orphans, brought from goodness-knows-where, have to be considered before anything else."
00:57:34.033,00:57:35.869,"-Now, now! -Oh, no, no."
00:57:37.287,00:57:38.288,I'm not vexed.
00:57:39.456,00:57:40.707,Don't worry yourself.
00:57:41.749,00:57:44.711,I feel too sorry for you to have any anger left in my mind.
00:57:46.254,00:57:52.469,"But if you will take my advice, you will have that talking-to with a fair-sized birch switch."
00:57:53.261,00:57:54.929,And get her on the next train out.
00:57:57.348,00:57:58.349,"Goodbye, Marilla."
00:58:47.607,00:58:49.359,She'll make her own way home.
00:58:51.027,00:58:52.362,I could go.
00:58:52.445,00:58:55.323,"She's in her underthings, so she's gotta come back."
00:58:59.202,00:59:03.164,I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lost my temper and embarrassed you in front of Mrs. Lynde.
00:59:03.248,00:59:04.999,I hope you can forgive me.
00:59:05.083,00:59:07.335,-Are you all right? -Yes.
00:59:08.211,00:59:11.422,I'm sorry for worrying you. I needed time to ponder.
00:59:13.174,00:59:17.679,"If you let me stay, I will do my very best not to fly into another temper ever again."
00:59:17.762,00:59:20.056,"I appreciate that you're contrite, Anne..."
00:59:20.723,00:59:23.434,but the person that you owe the apology to is Mrs. Lynde.
00:59:24.477,00:59:27.230,But she hadn't any right to call me ugly and redheaded.
00:59:29.566,00:59:33.778,But there's a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it.
00:59:33.861,00:59:35.738,You need to learn discipline.
00:59:35.822,00:59:40.326,Just imagine how you would feel if someone told you to your face that you were skinny and ugly.
00:59:40.410,00:59:51.796,"Remember when we were young, Marilla, old lady Adams said-- -Yes. -That you were gawky-- -Yes. Thank you. -I recall you suffered from it-- I don't say Mrs. Lynde was exactly right in saying what she did to you, Anne."
00:59:52.630,00:59:54.507,-She's too outspoken. -She's a bully.
00:59:54.591,00:59:57.844,But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part.
00:59:58.553,01:00:04.058,"You were rude and saucy, and you must go to Mrs. Lynde and tell her that you're sorry and ask her to forgive you."
01:00:05.602,01:00:08.479,I could never do that. Punish me any way you like.
01:00:08.563,01:00:14.527,"Shut me up in a dark, damp dungeon, and I shan't complain, but I cannot ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive me."
01:00:15.653,01:00:18.656,We're not in the habit of shutting people up in dungeons.
01:00:19.282,01:00:21.576,But apologize to Mrs. Lynde you must.
01:00:22.368,01:00:25.705,And you'll stay up in your room until you can tell me you're willing to do it.
01:00:25.788,01:00:30.918,"I'll have to stay up there forever, then, because I can't tell Mrs. Lynde I'm sorry I said those things to her."
01:00:31.836,01:00:34.589,How can I? I'm not sorry.
01:00:34.672,01:00:38.968,"I'm sorry I vexed you, but I'm glad I told her just what I did."
01:00:39.510,01:00:41.512,It was a great satisfaction!
01:00:43.264,01:00:47.518,"In fact, I can't even imagine that I'm sorry."
01:00:48.144,01:00:51.522,"Well, let's hope your imagination is in better working order by morning."
01:00:58.154,01:01:00.865,Y-You can't send her back over this.
01:01:01.658,01:01:03.451,Don't be so sure.
01:01:03.534,01:01:04.494,"Well, it's..."
01:01:06.162,01:01:09.749,"Well, it's good that, uh, Rachel got a calling-down."
01:01:09.832,01:01:11.376,Well...
01:01:12.001,01:01:15.338,"-Wish I'd been there. -Matthew Cuthbert, I'm astonished at you."
01:01:17.131,01:01:18.758,And you'll take her up a meal.
01:01:18.841,01:01:22.053,When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?
01:01:22.595,01:01:26.224,"She'll stay up there until she's willing to apologize, and that is final."
01:02:30.037,01:02:31.330,"How's by you, Anne?"
01:02:32.540,01:02:36.627,"I'm fairly well, thank you. I imagine a good deal, so that helps to pass the time."
01:02:41.340,01:02:43.718,"Don't you think you better, um, say it?"
01:02:44.552,01:02:46.971,Just have it over with?
01:02:47.722,01:02:49.432,"If I apologize, I'll be fibbing."
01:02:52.101,01:02:53.478,Hmm.
01:02:53.561,01:02:59.776,"It'll have to be done sooner or later, for Marilla's, um..."
01:03:00.818,01:03:04.113,"a dreadful determined woman, dreadful determined."
01:03:04.197,01:03:05.531,So am I.
01:03:12.497,01:03:14.040,"It's, uh..."
01:03:14.123,01:03:17.543,It's terrible lonesome downstairs without you.
01:03:19.670,01:03:21.589,I'm not used to the quiet anymore.
01:03:21.672,01:03:25.468,The trouble is that the prospect seems humiliating and unfair.
01:03:25.968,01:03:27.637,But you're smart enough...
01:03:28.679,01:03:31.641,"to find the right words, I'm sure of it."
01:03:31.724,01:03:36.938,But why should the apology have to come from me when it was Mrs. Lynde who caused the entire situation?
01:03:37.021,01:03:38.689,"Well, you know..."
01:03:40.858,01:03:42.819,I like to think that...
01:03:43.945,01:03:50.159,"that one fine day, it won't matter a whit to you what anybody says sideways."
01:03:51.369,01:03:53.162,You have a good imagination.
01:03:56.833,01:03:58.918,I suppose it would be true enough to say I'm sorry.
01:03:59.001,01:04:02.630,I am sorry I upset Miss Marilla. And you.
01:04:04.507,01:04:07.927,"So go and smooth things over, can't you?"
01:04:12.890,01:04:14.767,Very well. I'll attempt it.
01:04:15.768,01:04:16.602,For you.
01:04:17.937,01:04:20.022,Now that's good news.
01:04:26.946,01:04:34.620,"Don't tell Marilla we had a conversation, on account of we decided raising you was her department."
01:04:36.581,01:04:38.624,I shall carry our secret to my grave.
01:04:52.179,01:04:54.223,"Whatever you're thinking, Anne..."
01:04:54.932,01:04:56.851,I hope you're taking this seriously.
01:04:56.934,01:05:00.479,"Oh, I am. I'm imagining out what I must say to Mrs. Lynde."
01:05:10.239,01:05:15.036,"Oh, Mrs. Lynde, I am so extremely sorry! I could never express my sorrow, no!"
01:05:15.119,01:05:17.413,Not even if I used up a whole dictionary.
01:05:17.496,01:05:24.337,"I behaved terribly to you, and I've disgraced my dear friends, the Cuthberts, who may let me stay at Green Gables, even though I'm not a boy."
01:05:24.420,01:05:30.927,"I am a dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out by respectful society forever."
01:05:31.636,01:05:35.514,It was awful of me to fly into a temper because you told me the truth.
01:05:36.057,01:05:38.851,And it was the truth. Every word you said was true.
01:05:39.477,01:05:43.439,"My hair is red, and I am freckled and skinny and ugly."
01:05:43.522,01:05:45.775,"What I said to you was true, too, but I shouldn't have said it!"
01:05:45.858,01:05:49.195,"Oh, Mrs. Lynde! Please, please, say you can forgive me."
01:05:49.946,01:05:55.409,"If you refuse, it'll be a lifelong sorrow on a poor little orphan girl."
01:05:55.493,01:05:57.870,"Please, say you forgive me, Mrs. Lynde!"
01:05:57.954,01:06:00.206,"There, there. Get up, child."
01:06:01.415,01:06:03.167,Of course I forgive you.
01:06:04.293,01:06:08.005,"I guess I was a little hard on you, but I'm just an outspoken person."
01:06:08.089,01:06:09.966,"You mustn't mind me, that's what I say."
01:06:10.049,01:06:12.343,Thank you for your kind consideration.
01:06:13.469,01:06:16.013,I look forward to never minding what you say again.
01:06:21.519,01:06:24.146,"Although, it can't be denied your hair is terrible red."
01:06:24.563,01:06:26.065,But there may be hope for it.
01:06:26.774,01:06:29.777,There was a girl in our class who had hair every bit as red as yours.
01:06:30.820,01:06:32.071,"Do you recall, Marilla?"
01:06:32.780,01:06:36.659,"But when she grew up, it darkened to a real handsome auburn."
01:06:37.410,01:06:40.079,"I wouldn't be a mite surprised if yours did, too."
01:06:40.162,01:06:42.123,"Oh, Mrs. Lynde, you've given me hope!"
01:06:42.206,01:06:46.711,"I shall always remember that you were a benefactor-- We should run along, Rachel."
01:06:47.503,01:06:50.047,-Thank you for your graciousness. -Of course.
01:07:00.599,01:07:02.977,She has a queer way of expressing herself.
01:07:03.686,01:07:04.854,"Forcible, like."
01:07:05.980,01:07:07.732,"I apologized pretty well, didn't I?"
01:07:08.566,01:07:11.527,"I thought since I had to do it, I might as well do it thoroughly."
01:07:11.610,01:07:13.779,"Oh, you did it thoroughly all right."
01:07:14.613,01:07:17.408,I hope you try to control your temper better in the future.
01:07:17.491,01:07:20.286,I will. I absolutely will.
01:07:27.084,01:07:29.795,"I'm going to prove myself worthy of staying, Miss Cuthbert."
01:07:29.879,01:07:33.507,I've been making a list in my head of all the ways I might be useful to you both.
01:07:33.591,01:07:36.761,"In addition to the indoor chores, I'm sure I can help with the outdoors too."
01:07:36.844,01:07:39.889,I'm much stronger than I look. It isn't too mu...
01:07:43.851,01:07:45.144,You hired a boy?
01:07:46.020,01:07:48.022,But I haven't even finished my trial yet.
01:07:48.105,01:07:50.316,There's work needs to be done either way.
01:08:02.203,01:08:03.871,How long will you be here?
01:08:07.041,01:08:09.043,-With an E. -Uh...
01:08:09.126,01:08:12.421,Je m'appelle Jerry. Jerry Baynard. Nice to meet you.
01:08:13.005,01:08:14.924,Baynard? Foolhardy.
01:08:15.007,01:08:16.175,Pardon?
01:08:16.258,01:08:19.720,Your surname means reckless or foolhardy.
01:08:19.804,01:08:23.140,Charlemagne even named his impossible horse Baynard.
01:08:24.558,01:08:26.393,I don't know him. Charlemagne.
01:08:26.477,01:08:29.438,Of course you don't. He died hundreds of years ago!
01:08:33.234,01:08:34.819,"-So, you're living here now? -Yes."
01:08:35.528,01:08:37.404,Probably. I... I don't know.
01:08:37.488,01:08:38.864,Pretty here.
01:08:39.824,01:08:41.033,You're lucky.
01:08:41.117,01:08:43.494,I don't remember you from the orphanage.
01:08:43.577,01:08:45.830,"No, no. I live in town. Big family."
01:08:45.913,01:08:50.251,"We have a small shop, but with so many, some of us must work."
01:08:50.334,01:08:58.926,"Well, if you come from such a large family, it may trouble your conscience to know that you're displacing my own position in my very first potential family."
01:08:59.426,01:09:01.762,"I am hired through harvest, so..."
01:09:02.513,01:09:05.516,I don't think the Cuthberts will need you if I stay.
01:09:05.599,01:09:08.894,"In fact, if you hand me your pitchfork, I'll be happy to finish your task."
01:09:08.978,01:09:10.146,What's your problem?
01:09:10.980,01:09:12.773,You. You're my problem.
01:09:17.611,01:09:18.904,All I'm doing is my job.
01:09:18.988,01:09:20.906,What are you supposed to be doing?
01:10:00.779,01:10:02.865,My apology was an unmitigated success.
01:10:02.948,01:10:04.742,Mrs. Lynde was very pleased.
01:10:04.825,01:10:07.745,It's not Rachel Lynde that you need to worry about.
01:10:09.205,01:10:10.789,"Miss Cuthbert seemed pleased, too."
01:10:11.790,01:10:13.500,Now you're talking.
01:10:17.213,01:10:21.217,It'll ease Marilla's mind that I've got help.
01:10:24.011,01:10:27.556,"Matthew, are you sure you still want me to stay?"
01:10:38.984,01:10:40.486,But the thing of it is...
01:10:41.403,01:10:42.947,and Marilla won't admit this...
01:10:43.948,01:10:45.824,"but she's getting older, too."
01:10:47.159,01:10:48.452,I'll go right in!
01:10:50.079,01:10:51.163,That's a good idea.
01:10:53.207,01:10:54.416,"Hey, hey."
01:11:09.974,01:11:13.143,"-Good day to you, Matthew. -William. Checking the perimeter?"
01:11:13.227,01:11:15.145,Anything I should know about?
01:11:15.229,01:11:18.482,I wanted to talk to you about your new acquisition.
01:11:19.233,01:11:20.067,New?
01:11:20.776,01:11:23.153,The orphan girl. From Nova Scotia.
01:11:24.071,01:11:24.905,Oh.
01:11:26.365,01:11:28.951,Word in town has it that you're keeping the girl?
01:11:29.827,01:11:34.123,"Well, we're pretty well decided, that's true enough."
01:11:34.206,01:11:36.917,I wonder if Marilla and the girl could come to call.
01:11:37.001,01:11:38.877,Her name's Anne.
01:11:40.045,01:11:43.590,The girl. And that's... that's real neighborly of you.
01:11:43.674,01:11:44.633,Uh...
01:11:44.717,01:11:48.929,I'm guessing that she and your Diana are about the same age.
01:11:49.680,01:11:59.648,"Before we permit our children to associate with your Anne, my wife and I need to assure ourselves that she won't corrupt their good natures, or exert any negative influence."
01:11:59.732,01:12:01.358,I'm sure you can understand.
01:12:02.776,01:12:05.029,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I understand."
01:12:06.405,01:12:07.323,Very good.
01:12:08.699,01:12:10.868,-Afternoon tea tomorrow? -Tea tomorrow.
01:12:11.869,01:12:14.997,-Excellent. Good day to you. -Mm.
01:12:19.793,01:12:23.797,We've got an invitation to tea tomorrow afternoon.
01:12:25.174,01:12:26.258,The Barrys.
01:12:27.134,01:12:28.218,They want to meet Anne.
01:12:29.720,01:12:33.307,"I haven't finished the dress. She can't go wearing that. Oh, my heavens!"
01:12:33.390,01:12:35.809,"Who are the Barrys, and why do they want to meet me?"
01:12:35.893,01:12:37.186,Our neighbors.
01:12:37.269,01:12:39.271,A very respectable family.
01:12:40.064,01:12:43.484,Hem. Buttons. You'll want to be on your best behavior.
01:12:43.567,01:12:44.401,"But, why?"
01:12:44.485,01:12:47.196,They have two little girls who are very well mannered.
01:12:51.533,01:12:53.243,Do they... need help?
01:12:54.661,01:12:57.873,Diana is the girl nearest your age.
01:12:57.956,01:13:01.710,"If you stay here, perhaps you two will become friends."
01:13:04.421,01:13:05.422,A real friend.
01:13:08.425,01:13:09.885,Shut it! I mean it!
01:13:15.766,01:13:17.184,Go get it.
01:13:21.313,01:13:23.273,-Hold her down. -Please don't!
01:13:23.357,01:13:25.692,-Don't! -Stop talking!
01:13:29.988,01:13:33.784,"Guess what, Princess Cordelia? We're sick of you and your stupid stories!"
01:13:33.867,01:13:35.369,-Stupid stories! -Liar!
01:13:37.663,01:13:39.832,This little mousey made too much noise.
01:13:42.584,01:13:44.002,But then it got caught in a trap.
01:13:45.546,01:13:48.048,So now... no more squeaking!
01:13:50.134,01:13:53.095,"So, shut your face from now on!"
01:13:56.849,01:13:57.683,Let's go.
01:14:10.821,01:14:12.197,I'm so sorry.
01:14:15.325,01:14:17.369,No startling speeches.
01:14:18.537,01:14:20.330,"Anne, what's wrong?"
01:14:20.956,01:14:21.999,Are you ill?
01:14:25.002,01:14:26.253,"No, Miss Cuthbert."
01:14:26.795,01:14:27.796,I'm fine.
01:14:28.464,01:14:29.339,Don't worry.
01:14:30.257,01:14:31.758,I'll be as quiet as a mouse.
01:14:49.860,01:14:54.156,"Um, I don't feel nearly as squashed in it as I did in my old one."
01:14:54.239,01:14:55.741,"High praise, indeed."
01:14:56.617,01:14:58.202,You've got room to grow.
01:14:58.702,01:15:02.498,"It's so nice to be wearing something new, I don't even mind not having puff sleeves."
01:15:05.209,01:15:09.296,"This was mine as a girl, so it's far from new..."
01:15:10.214,01:15:11.673,but it'll do nicely.
01:15:15.969,01:15:16.887,Thank you!
01:15:18.138,01:15:19.306,It's so pretty.
01:15:21.767,01:15:25.312,"You look clean and tidy, and that's what counts."
01:15:26.647,01:15:27.898,"Oh, isn't this lovely?"
01:15:27.981,01:15:29.775,-Hand it here. -May I try it on?
01:15:29.858,01:15:31.401,That is not a toy.
01:15:33.362,01:15:36.782,This is a treasured possession. Do you understand?
01:15:36.865,01:15:38.200,I completely understand.
01:15:38.283,01:15:40.077,Amethyst is my favorite.
01:15:40.577,01:15:43.664,-I think diamonds pale in comparison. -Do you now?
01:15:43.747,01:15:46.583,Amethysts are so much more romantic.
01:15:46.667,01:15:49.419,Now this was my grandmother's.
01:15:50.295,01:15:52.673,My mother bequeathed it to me.
01:15:53.340,01:15:54.633,"Well, it's perfectly elegant."
01:15:57.135,01:15:58.971,-I'm not sure. -What do you mean?
01:15:59.054,01:16:00.097,It's just...
01:16:00.889,01:16:02.975,this is a meeting of great auspiciousness.
01:16:04.351,01:16:05.769,What if she doesn't like me?
01:16:05.852,01:16:07.813,"Oh, it's her mother you gotta reckon with."
01:16:08.313,01:16:11.775,"If Mrs. Barry doesn't like you, it won't matter a whit how much Diana does."
01:16:16.363,01:16:19.992,"Whatever's the matter with you, child? You haven't said a word since we left."
01:16:20.075,01:16:21.577,You're not yourself.
01:16:22.828,01:16:23.787,Perfect.
01:16:33.505,01:16:36.633,"-Good afternoon, Miss Cuthbert. -Afternoon, Mrs. Barry."
01:16:36.717,01:16:38.468,"Please, call me Eliza."
01:16:38.552,01:16:39.553,Oh.
01:16:39.636,01:16:41.930,And this must be Anne.
01:16:45.392,01:16:46.393,Good afternoon.
01:16:50.147,01:16:51.398,Good afternoon.
01:16:52.774,01:16:53.692,Afternoon.
01:16:55.068,01:16:57.362,"Thank you for having us, Eliza."
01:16:57.946,01:17:01.241,"Marilla, Anne, please come in."
01:17:16.506,01:17:18.884,I don't believe you said two words during tea.
01:17:21.011,01:17:22.888,You didn't even remark on the cake.
01:17:23.764,01:17:25.724,Mother let me help her bake it special.
01:17:27.976,01:17:31.104,"You enjoyed it, didn't you?"
01:17:32.648,01:17:34.483,The cake was scrumptious.
01:17:41.365,01:17:44.910,"Have you always been shy, or does it come from being an orphan?"
01:17:46.119,01:17:48.372,I'm less shy than reticent.
01:17:49.373,01:17:51.625,Goodness! There's another 25-cent word.
01:17:53.126,01:17:54.336,It's just...
01:17:54.920,01:17:55.962,Yes?
01:17:57.130,01:17:59.341,I like to read. When I can.
01:17:59.424,01:18:03.970,"I like reading, too, but Mother prefers that I do needlepoint."
01:18:05.430,01:18:08.058,Does needlepoint provide much scope for the imagination?
01:18:08.892,01:18:11.561,I don't think imagination is my strong suit.
01:18:12.062,01:18:13.063,Really?
01:18:13.939,01:18:15.982,I don't know what I'd do without mine.
01:18:17.401,01:18:18.652,Life would be an agony.
01:18:18.735,01:18:20.612,An utter agony.
01:18:21.154,01:18:22.197,Agony!
01:18:25.450,01:18:26.910,I make up stories all the time.
01:18:28.203,01:18:29.329,I could never do that.
01:18:31.540,01:18:48.598,"I like to imagine that I am a princess in a tower, or Joan of Arc riding into battle, or a forlorn bride who lives by the sea, but never speaks to anyone because her one true love was lost when his ship went down, and disappeared beneath the waves!"
01:18:51.810,01:18:53.520,Could you tell me a story now?
01:18:57.649,01:19:01.987,Diana... do you think you could like me just a little?
01:19:02.779,01:19:04.197,I already do!
01:19:05.657,01:19:08.368,Shall we swear to be best friends forever and ever?
01:19:10.370,01:19:12.080,It's dreadfully wicked to swear.
01:19:13.290,01:19:15.208,No! It's not my kind of swearing.
01:19:15.292,01:19:16.376,There are two kinds.
01:19:16.918,01:19:21.381,I know because I have a worldly outlook. This kind isn't wicked at all.
01:19:21.465,01:19:24.801,It means vowing and promising solemnly.
01:19:24.885,01:19:26.011,I swear it does.
01:19:26.386,01:19:27.262,See?
01:19:31.725,01:19:33.810,-How do you do it? -Well...
01:19:38.398,01:19:42.068,"Well, this ought to be done by moonlight or over running water..."
01:19:42.944,01:19:47.073,"but we'll imagine that it's nighttime, and this path is a stream."
01:19:48.575,01:19:51.703,"Hold this, and twist your pinky finger around mine."
01:19:53.830,01:19:55.373,I'll repeat the oath first.
01:19:57.000,01:19:58.376,I solemnly swear...
01:19:58.460,01:20:03.924,"...to be faithful to my bosom friend, Diana Barry, for as long as the sun and moon shall endure."
01:20:04.341,01:20:06.259,And then she said it and put my name in.
01:20:07.344,01:20:10.972,-And then we sent our oath into the world. -Not in the...
01:20:12.516,01:20:14.309,-Oh! -Sorry! I'll collect them.
01:20:15.644,01:20:17.896,It was a wonderful afternoon. I'm so relieved.
01:20:19.147,01:20:21.525,It seems you made a favorable impression with the Barrys.
01:20:22.943,01:20:24.694,And Diana didn't mind my stories at all.
01:20:24.778,01:20:29.491,"In fact, I told her two, and we promised to make up another the next time we're together."
01:20:30.826,01:20:37.332,"Diana says she doesn't have much imagination, but I don't think it matters, since I have enough for both of us."
01:20:39.543,01:20:42.504,They're hosting a church picnic next week at the Lake of Shining Waters.
01:20:43.129,01:20:46.174,"I've never been to a picnic. Can we go, Miss Cuthbert?"
01:20:49.928,01:20:52.222,Diana and I are kindred spirits.
01:20:52.806,01:20:55.517,And I think she'd be struck quite sad if I were to be sent away.
01:20:55.600,01:20:58.854,"Please take my shawl upstairs, and lay it neatly on my chair."
01:21:00.272,01:21:02.440,May I go outside after and help Matthew with the cattle?
01:21:02.524,01:21:04.401,I can't wait to tell him everything!
01:21:05.068,01:21:07.779,As long as you're helping and not just flapping your gums.
01:21:07.863,01:21:09.030,Mm.
01:21:28.300,01:21:31.803,"I'm sorry to arrive so late to the ball, dear Prince Wisteria."
01:21:34.890,01:21:38.560,One of my squires returned on horseback after a harrowing journey...
01:21:39.811,01:21:43.565,and handed me a letter that required my urgent attention.
01:21:44.149,01:21:46.860,"So, please, do not doubt my love."
01:21:47.861,01:21:51.615,"And please, please, let the Cuthberts decide to keep me."
01:21:51.698,01:21:57.162,"I realize now it's the only thing I truly want, so you don't have to worry yourself about my red hair."
01:21:58.246,01:21:59.331,Amen.
01:22:01.374,01:22:04.169,-Where is my brooch? -It should be there on your shawl.
01:22:04.794,01:22:06.046,It is not.
01:22:06.129,01:22:07.964,Nor is it in my jewelry box.
01:22:08.673,01:22:09.925,Did you take it?
01:22:10.967,01:22:12.886,"I was playing with it, but I didn't take it."
01:22:16.556,01:22:18.475,"It's so beautiful, I couldn't resist."
01:22:18.558,01:22:20.769,You were told to set the shawl on the chair.
01:22:20.852,01:22:21.686,I did.
01:22:21.770,01:22:24.981,"Well, I've looked everywhere. The brooch is nowhere to be found."
01:22:28.401,01:22:30.403,Give it back. Right now.
01:22:31.446,01:22:34.532,"But I didn't take it, Miss Cuthbert. Honest, I didn't."
01:22:34.616,01:22:35.951,I don't believe you.
01:22:36.034,01:22:37.702,Where else would it be?
01:22:38.703,01:22:39.788,Confess at once.
01:22:40.997,01:22:41.957,But I...
01:22:42.707,01:22:45.085,I'm not gonna live with a thief under my roof!
01:22:45.961,01:22:49.798,"You confess to stealing the brooch, or you have no future here at Green Gables."
01:22:49.881,01:22:50.924,But I didn't take it.
01:22:51.007,01:22:54.052,Confess! Or I'll send you right back to the asylum.
01:22:56.680,01:22:59.933,"If I don't confess, you'll send me back?"
01:23:00.892,01:23:02.602,Confess to what you have done!
01:23:04.229,01:23:06.982,"If I do, can I stay here at Green Gables?"
01:23:07.857,01:23:10.360,Did you or did you not take the brooch?
01:23:17.242,01:23:21.621,I-I was playing Lady Cordelia when I took the brooch outside with me.
01:23:22.372,01:23:26.334,"And as I was drawing water from the well, I leaned over to make a wish and it fell in."
01:23:26.960,01:23:30.714,"I heard it make a splash, as it disappeared down into the depths."
01:23:31.631,01:23:33.717,"I'm ever so sorry, Miss Cuthbert."
01:23:38.555,01:23:39.681,Pack your things.
01:23:43.351,01:23:46.354,I told you that brooch meant a great deal to me.
01:23:46.438,01:23:48.106,"No, b-b-but I-I made that up!"
01:23:48.189,01:23:52.360,None of that was real! I didn't take your brooch! I don't know where it is!
01:23:52.444,01:23:54.696,"Please, Miss Cuthbert, you have to believe me."
01:23:54.779,01:23:56.614,I don't have to do anything!
01:23:56.698,01:23:57.866,"Please, Miss Cuthbert."
01:23:57.949,01:23:59.868,I can't trust one word out of your mouth.
01:23:59.951,01:24:01.619,-Please. -Enough!
01:24:03.079,01:24:04.706,You're not to leave this room tonight.
01:24:06.082,01:24:09.085,"Tomorrow, you will go at first light."
01:26:25.054,01:26:26.389,Matthew!
01:26:27.307,01:26:28.516,Matthew!
01:26:31.644,01:26:32.478,Giddyup! Giddyup!
01:26:39.194,01:26:41.571,Hyah! Hyah!
01:26:43.531,01:26:44.782,Hyah!
01:27:07.847,01:27:09.098,Did I miss it?
01:27:09.182,01:27:10.475,Did I miss the train?
01:27:10.975,01:27:13.436,"Oh, not to worry. Your girl got on all right."
00:00:20.186,00:00:21.604,The orphanage.
00:00:51.843,00:00:53.428,How did she seem?
00:00:55.221,00:00:56.848,"Yes, she was real quiet."
00:00:57.932,00:00:59.601,Didn't say a word.
00:01:12.697,00:01:14.032,Miss!
00:01:15.116,00:01:16.993,"Miss, Miss. Right this way, Miss."
00:01:17.077,00:01:18.661,Who are you?
00:01:18.745,00:01:22.165,"-I'm supposed to fetch you, Miss. -I don't understand. Who sent you?"
00:01:22.248,00:01:25.376,"Why, your family, of course. Now right this way, little lady."
00:01:25.460,00:01:26.503,My family?
00:01:26.586,00:01:29.839,"They sent me to collect you, and bring you home. We'll be there in a jiff."
00:01:29.923,00:01:31.674,-Let go of me. -Quickly now. Let's hurry up.
00:01:31.758,00:01:33.802,I've got some lovely sweets for the ride.
00:01:45.605,00:01:49.150,"Hello, young masters. I've been sent to take you home."
00:01:59.577,00:02:03.206,"Uh, good evening. Was wondering if you could spare a fresh horse."
00:02:04.040,00:02:06.126,"Sorry, sir. I don't have one to lend."
00:02:06.209,00:02:08.962,"Mine's dead-beat, and I need to get to Charlottetown."
00:02:09.963,00:02:12.215,Please! Any horse will do.
00:02:12.298,00:02:14.050,"Sorry, but I can't oblige you, sir."
00:02:14.926,00:02:17.470,I am good for it. I'll bring the money when I return.
00:02:17.554,00:02:19.722,-Sir-- -I live in Avonlea at Green Gables.
00:02:19.806,00:02:21.599,"Money or not, I'm afraid I can't help you."
00:02:21.683,00:02:24.477,"These belong to the guests, and the hotel's are spoken for."
00:02:24.561,00:02:26.354,"You're welcome to rest yours here, though."
00:02:29.023,00:02:30.984,Sam! Sam!
00:02:31.067,00:02:31.901,Vessel?
00:02:31.985,00:02:35.864,"Whoa. Matthew Cuthbert, whatever's got you all twisted up?"
00:02:35.947,00:02:37.824,Are you heading to the vessel?
00:02:37.907,00:02:40.493,Yes. We're riding to the port overnight. Be there by daybreak.
00:02:40.577,00:02:43.538,"Uh, can I hitch a ride? I need to get to Charlottetown!"
00:02:44.205,00:02:46.708,-I'm not riding him back. -No worries at all!
00:02:46.791,00:02:48.251,Much obliged.
00:05:26.075,00:05:28.745,We're sick of you and your stupid stories!
00:05:35.126,00:05:36.127,Stop it!
00:05:37.462,00:05:40.423,Stop it at once! Stop it! You get in there!
00:06:26.677,00:06:27.887,"Oh, quickly now!"
00:06:32.433,00:06:33.559,Quick!
00:06:34.644,00:06:35.978,"Oh, easy, easy!"
00:06:36.062,00:06:38.147,"I'm sorry, Miss Cuthbert. I was not quite finished!"
00:06:38.231,00:06:39.690,"Oh, please hurry!"
00:06:39.774,00:06:43.402,"Uh, continue with the barn work. Stack some wood in the kitchen. I have to go!"
00:06:58.042,00:06:59.085,Marilla!
00:07:03.673,00:07:05.800,-Marilla! -I have to go!
00:07:05.883,00:07:07.677,Wait! Wait!
00:07:07.760,00:07:08.761,Wait.
00:07:08.845,00:07:12.098,Thomas rode out at first light. I came to tell you.
00:07:12.181,00:07:13.766,Where is he going?
00:07:13.850,00:07:14.976,To look for them.
00:07:15.059,00:07:18.396,The only reason I could see for Matthew tearing off yesterday was to fetch Anne.
00:07:18.479,00:07:21.357,"-When they didn't return, I was worried. -Please step aside, Rachel."
00:07:21.441,00:07:24.152,-I knew you'd be beside yourself. -I need to go! I must go now!
00:07:24.235,00:07:27.280,"No, listen, dear. Thomas will ride all the way to the train station."
00:07:27.363,00:07:30.366,-He'll check the road as he goes. -What if he's lying dead in a ditch?
00:07:30.450,00:07:32.285,-Marilla! -What if they both are?
00:07:32.368,00:07:34.662,What if something horrible happened and it's my fault?
00:07:34.745,00:07:36.247,"Stop it, Marilla!"
00:07:36.873,00:07:38.124,Boy!
00:07:40.334,00:07:42.753,Thomas is miles ahead of you.
00:07:42.837,00:07:45.131,"Now, the only thing to do now is to wait."
00:07:46.340,00:07:48.384,"-Take the rig back in. -Yes, ma'am."
00:07:52.638,00:07:53.973,Give me your hand.
00:07:55.391,00:07:58.603,Watch your step. Carefully now. Careful.
00:08:01.063,00:08:02.773,All right. Now...
00:08:04.275,00:08:05.526,Come along inside.
00:08:06.944,00:08:08.279,We'll put the kettle on.
00:09:39.579,00:09:41.831,"-Hello, Mr. Avery. -Oh, goodness!"
00:09:43.457,00:09:45.209,My word! D-D-Do I know you?
00:09:45.293,00:09:48.588,Not yet. But I know you. I'm sure we'll become better acquainted on the ride.
00:09:49.422,00:09:50.256,The ride?
00:09:50.339,00:09:53.634,The matron was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking me to the train station.
00:09:53.718,00:09:56.637,"I'm going home to Halifax, you see. That's where I was born."
00:09:56.721,00:09:58.806,"Uh, I-I-I don't know if I can take you."
00:09:58.889,00:10:02.602,It seems a wealthy aunt has just been discovered and sent for me.
00:10:02.685,00:10:04.186,Isn't that wonderful?
00:10:04.270,00:10:10.568,"Yes, it is, but I-I-I've got several deliveries to make-- My years of torment and uncertainty are behind me."
00:10:10.651,00:10:14.113,"And I'll have to learn all manner of comportment, but I'm equal to the task."
00:10:14.196,00:10:16.782,-You're moving up in the world. -I am.
00:10:16.866,00:10:20.494,"I am, indeed. So if you wouldn't mind conveying me towards my new life?"
00:10:20.578,00:10:24.498,"No, i-i-it's not that I mind, but trouble is I've got several stops along the way."
00:10:24.582,00:10:26.208,"It'll be a few hours, I'm afraid."
00:10:26.292,00:10:29.378,"If you're in a hurry, you might find a better mode. Shall we ask the matron?"
00:10:29.462,00:10:31.672,"No, no, no! No. This will be perfect."
00:10:31.756,00:10:34.967,"And I'm sorry I don't have any money to pay you, but I'll be happy to help."
00:10:38.429,00:10:39.597,"Well, uh..."
00:10:58.532,00:11:00.284,I've got radishes!
00:11:45.079,00:11:48.541,I don't know how much I can get for it with this here monogram.
00:11:48.624,00:11:50.376,"Well, I... I don't need much."
00:11:50.459,00:11:52.378,Then we are well met.
00:11:53.671,00:11:57.174,"-It's a family heirloom. -Uh, show me something in here that ain't."
00:11:58.217,00:11:59.468,I don't know.
00:12:00.010,00:12:02.763,I'll think about it. Why don't you come back tomorrow?
00:12:07.893,00:12:12.565,"I mean, all I need is train fare for two up island, and ferry rides back and forth to the mainland."
00:12:16.110,00:12:18.154,"I'll see what I can do, all right?"
00:12:21.157,00:12:23.617,Scientists predict greenhouse effect!
00:12:23.701,00:12:25.202,"Extra, extra!"
00:12:25.286,00:12:27.413,Scientists predict greenhouse effect!
00:12:27.496,00:12:29.331,What time does the ferry to Nova Scotia go?
00:12:29.415,00:12:31.208,Around about five o'clock.
00:12:31.292,00:12:34.295,Local boy loses life by drowning!
00:12:52.313,00:12:53.981,"Move out of the way, mister!"
00:13:11.373,00:13:18.088,And I believe my parents traveled to India and many faraway lands before they were killed tragically in service of the Queen.
00:13:18.172,00:13:19.798,You don't say!
00:13:19.882,00:13:21.967,I imagine they were ever so noble.
00:13:22.760,00:13:25.513,"Easy, easy. Whoa!"
00:13:25.596,00:13:27.223,All right. Off you go.
00:13:27.306,00:13:28.432,Going!
00:13:31.060,00:13:33.062,I'm told I'm fleet of foot.
00:13:33.145,00:13:34.230,"Oh, yes?"
00:13:35.147,00:13:38.317,"Now, I'd rather be beautiful, but you can't have everything."
00:13:42.404,00:13:43.906,All right.
00:13:53.499,00:13:55.042,I was going to learn.
00:13:55.125,00:13:58.212,The lady at my last household in Avonlea said she would teach me.
00:13:58.295,00:13:59.547,Oh.
00:14:00.506,00:14:01.507,Doesn't matter.
00:14:06.428,00:14:08.514,"No, no. I-I couldn't deprive you."
00:14:08.597,00:14:10.558,"Oh, help yourself."
00:14:10.641,00:14:12.768,-Got plenty. -Hmm.
00:14:12.851,00:14:14.770,Well...
00:14:14.853,00:14:16.272,Much obliged!
00:14:16.355,00:14:17.565,Walk on.
00:14:21.318,00:14:23.320,I haven't eaten since yesterday.
00:14:23.404,00:14:25.531,-Matron trying to starve you? -What?
00:14:25.614,00:14:27.658,They didn't feed you this morning?
00:14:27.741,00:14:31.078,"Well, I was too preoccupied to eat."
00:14:31.161,00:14:33.873,-What with my life starting over and all. -Uh-huh.
00:14:34.874,00:14:37.293,-What were they doing for her? -Who?
00:14:37.376,00:14:39.128,Your parents. For the Queen.
00:14:39.211,00:14:42.047,Oh! Right! Espionage.
00:14:44.842,00:14:48.053,There. That's the best I can do until the doctor comes.
00:14:48.137,00:14:51.432,It's been hours. I hope bringing him here was the right thing to do.
00:15:02.109,00:15:05.613,"Oh, no, no, no. I can't be late."
00:15:07.698,00:15:10.451,The ferry. I can't miss it!
00:15:12.077,00:15:13.370,Where am I?
00:15:13.871,00:15:15.456,Where's the ferry from here?
00:15:40.564,00:15:41.690,Hello?
00:15:43.442,00:15:44.652,Hello?
00:15:51.450,00:15:53.160,Someone! Come on!
00:16:50.676,00:16:51.719,"Oh, my word!"
00:16:51.802,00:16:53.095,"Oh, please! No, uh..."
00:16:53.178,00:16:55.889,-D-D-Don't be frightened. -Get away! You can't loiter here!
00:16:55.973,00:16:59.101,-I must speak with the matron. -The matron? She's not even awake.
00:16:59.184,00:17:02.354,-It's an emergency. -You'll have to come-- There's been a mistake!
00:17:03.397,00:17:06.650,"My girl... My little girl, she's here."
00:17:10.320,00:17:11.613,Please.
00:17:17.786,00:17:18.912,Thank you.
00:17:19.621,00:17:21.081,Were you out there all night?
00:17:24.460,00:17:27.755,"-What happened anyways? -Oh, there was a... a misunderstanding."
00:17:27.838,00:17:29.757,-Looks like it. -What?
00:17:29.840,00:17:32.426,You've been fighting? And at your age!
00:17:33.010,00:17:34.678,"-Men. -Uh, kitchen's this way."
00:17:34.762,00:17:38.640,"Dora, tell Matron there's an emergency. Someone needs to see her right away."
00:17:39.349,00:17:43.604,"I'll get hot water for washing up, and we'll look at that bandage before you see Matron."
00:17:43.687,00:17:45.064,"No, no. There's no need."
00:17:45.147,00:17:46.523,Have you seen you?
00:17:47.149,00:17:49.026,"Um, much obliged."
00:18:01.789,00:18:04.333,"Morning, Miss Cuthbert. Do you need something?"
00:18:09.046,00:18:10.047,For me?
00:18:20.182,00:18:21.391,Merci.
00:18:22.976,00:18:24.353,There's plenty more.
00:18:25.687,00:18:26.980,Thank you.
00:18:30.150,00:18:32.569,Yes? What is the nature of your emergency?
00:18:32.653,00:18:35.030,"Yes, good morning."
00:18:35.114,00:18:37.116,I need to take Anne Shirley home.
00:18:37.199,00:18:39.743,She was adopted. She's no longer in residence.
00:18:39.827,00:18:43.372,"But she... No, no. She came back here yesterday, did she not?"
00:18:43.455,00:18:45.541,She did not. Now please excuse me!
00:18:45.624,00:18:48.085,But... but she has to be here.
00:18:48.168,00:18:52.714,The ferry master said that he'd seen her. Said she... she came across yesterday.
00:18:53.340,00:18:54.383,Red braids?
00:18:54.466,00:18:57.719,"Oh, I remember her distinctly, but the girl is not here."
00:19:05.394,00:19:06.728,Gave me a start.
00:19:07.312,00:19:08.313,Beg your pardon.
00:19:08.397,00:19:11.650,"Same thing happened yesterday. Only that time, it was a little girl."
00:19:20.993,00:19:30.127,"And fleeting joy does lasting doubt inspire, and most we question what we most desire!"
00:19:31.795,00:19:33.005,Thank you!
00:19:52.524,00:19:55.027,-Please be patient. -Excuse me.
00:19:55.110,00:20:00.449,May I interest you in a poetic recitation spoken aloud with dignified emotion?
00:20:02.951,00:20:04.244,It's only a dollar.
00:20:04.328,00:20:05.412,50 cents?
00:20:06.205,00:20:07.831,I need a train fare to Halifax.
00:20:07.915,00:20:09.458,I promise you'll like it.
00:20:09.541,00:20:11.001,"Excuse me, sir?"
00:20:11.084,00:20:16.256,May I interest you in a rousing tale of heroic deeds and acts of bravery?
00:20:17.674,00:20:19.134,It'll pass the time.
00:20:26.308,00:20:27.809,Pardon me.
00:20:27.893,00:20:36.610,May I transport you for a few minutes with a romantical recitation replete with the tragedy of a love unrequited?
00:20:41.198,00:20:46.203,"If thou must love me, let it be for nought except for love's sake only."
00:20:48.580,00:21:04.805,"Do not say 'I love her' for her smile, her look, her way of speaking gently for a trick of thought that falls in well with mine, and certes brought a sense of pleasant ease on such a day..."
00:21:11.478,00:21:19.194,"For these things in themselves may be changed or change for thee, and a love so wrought may be unwrought..."
00:21:19.278,00:21:21.863,Anne... thank goodness I've found you.
00:21:24.074,00:21:28.078,"So Marilla must have found the brooch, then, because I am not a thief."
00:21:28.954,00:21:31.832,"If you'll please excuse me, I'm in the middle of earning some wages."
00:21:31.915,00:21:33.667,I've got a train to catch.
00:21:33.750,00:21:36.712,"Thine love, dear, wiping my cheeks..."
00:21:36.795,00:21:38.422,Please... Anne!
00:21:38.505,00:21:40.215,A creature might forget to...
00:21:40.299,00:21:42.467,It was a terrible misunderstanding.
00:21:42.551,00:21:44.928,Thank you anyways. It was very nice.
00:21:45.971,00:21:47.306,But I'm not finished.
00:21:47.389,00:21:50.309,-We've heard quite enough. -Yes.
00:21:50.767,00:21:53.270,"-Do you want your money back? -Anne, please!"
00:21:54.104,00:21:55.522,Listen to me.
00:21:58.817,00:22:01.945,Why? So you can banish me whenever you feel like it?
00:22:02.029,00:22:05.324,"I am my own family now, and I am all I need!"
00:22:05.991,00:22:07.075,"-Anne, no! -Poems!"
00:22:07.159,00:22:10.120,"-Poems for sale! -Wait, wait! Anne! Listen."
00:22:10.454,00:22:12.914,I-I-I've come for you. I came all this way.
00:22:12.998,00:22:13.999,"Oh, bully for you!"
00:22:14.082,00:22:16.918,Because so did I and not by choice.
00:22:17.002,00:22:20.380,I had to come all this way because you didn't want me!
00:22:20.464,00:22:22.507,"I do want you, Anne. We do."
00:22:22.591,00:22:25.927,I would appreciate it if you would leave me alone.
00:22:27.679,00:22:28.722,Please.
00:22:29.347,00:22:31.558,-Please. -Please?
00:22:31.641,00:22:35.145,"Oh, I'll give you a please! Please have the decency to let me be!"
00:22:36.021,00:22:37.147,Is there a problem here?
00:22:40.942,00:22:42.694,Is this man bothering you?
00:22:42.778,00:22:45.155,"No, no. Uh... We're fine."
00:22:45.238,00:22:47.282,This man is indeed bothering me.
00:22:47.866,00:22:50.619,-That so? -We're fine. She's my daughter.
00:24:40.979,00:24:42.564,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:24:47.194,00:24:49.529,"Well, it certainly took you long enough to fetch her!"
00:24:51.198,00:24:54.367,"Oh, I'm sorry to... cause you worry, Marilla."
00:24:56.661,00:24:58.121,"Hello, Miss Cuthbert."
00:24:59.080,00:25:00.498,"Hello, Anne."
00:25:00.582,00:25:02.000,It's nice to see you back.
00:25:02.667,00:25:05.253,Please take your things up to your room. I'll get supper on.
00:26:49.566,00:26:53.528,We're having a simple supper. I won't need your help. Come down when you're ready.
00:26:56.531,00:26:57.741,"Yes, Miss Cuthbert."
00:26:58.825,00:27:00.327,I'll-I'll see you downstairs.
00:27:16.551,00:27:18.261,You'll be wanting the egg cups?
00:27:18.345,00:27:19.596,"Yes, please."
00:27:20.764,00:27:22.432,Did you bring your laundry down?
00:27:26.394,00:27:27.729,Please attend to the toast.
00:27:35.195,00:27:36.321,Excuse me.
00:27:37.572,00:27:38.823,Of course.
00:27:58.051,00:27:59.719,On the table. Thank you.
00:28:55.567,00:28:59.237,I'll be out to... walk the potato vines today.
00:29:06.911,00:29:10.707,I might send Jerry to the smithy with the bay for shoes.
00:29:10.790,00:29:12.250,I'll pack him a lunch.
00:29:13.418,00:29:14.669,All right.
00:29:16.504,00:29:17.881,"All right, then."
00:29:31.186,00:29:32.729,"It was so awful, Belle."
00:29:34.355,00:29:37.400,"When I saw the orphanage again, you can't imagine my dread."
00:29:40.069,00:29:41.404,And now I'm back.
00:29:46.451,00:29:49.996,How dare you sneak around listening to my private conversation!
00:29:50.622,00:29:52.749,I wasn't listening. I was sleeping.
00:29:52.832,00:29:54.459,So you're lazy and a snoop.
00:29:54.542,00:29:56.377,It was too late to go home last night.
00:29:56.461,00:30:00.089,There was so much work because Mr. Cuthbert was away looking for you.
00:30:01.216,00:30:02.675,What all did you hear me say?
00:30:03.426,00:30:05.762,Why would I care what you say to a horse?
00:30:06.304,00:30:08.598,I need coffee. I'm going in to ask.
00:30:09.182,00:30:11.392,-Why do you have that plate? Careful. -I...
00:30:12.018,00:30:13.812,"Or they'll call you a thief, too."
00:30:13.895,00:30:17.190,"No, no, the lady brought it to me yesterday when she was distraite."
00:30:18.525,00:30:21.236,Why anyone would worry over you is a mystery for sure.
00:30:43.550,00:30:45.552,"You're so smart, Anne."
00:30:45.635,00:30:48.304,I never would have thought to sell poems for train fare.
00:30:49.097,00:30:51.307,And you're home in time for the church picnic.
00:30:51.391,00:30:53.142,Did I tell you we're hosting it here?
00:30:54.143,00:30:55.603,"I'm really glad you're back, Anne."
00:30:56.271,00:30:57.564,"Well, you're the only one."
00:30:57.647,00:31:00.733,"Well, Matthew seems to be, but he must have talked her into it."
00:31:04.112,00:31:05.363,I'm sure it's not true.
00:31:05.446,00:31:08.366,"Oh, Miss Cuthbert wasn't happy to see me. She didn't care a whit."
00:31:08.449,00:31:13.329,But Rachel Lynde told Mother that Miss Cuthbert was torn asunder after you left.
00:31:13.413,00:31:14.706,Not possible.
00:31:15.290,00:31:18.585,"Miss Cuthbert was so upset, Rachel Lynde feared she'd take sick."
00:31:19.502,00:31:21.254,Not. Possible.
00:31:23.047,00:31:25.174,"Well, that's what she told Mother."
00:31:25.800,00:31:27.510,Then why doesn't she show it?
00:31:27.594,00:31:31.472,It's hard to believe she was sorrowful when she doesn't seem to like me at all.
00:31:32.307,00:31:33.683,At least you're home.
00:31:39.647,00:31:40.940,I've missed you.
00:31:45.111,00:31:52.285,"And I don't mean to seem ungrateful, and it did fill my heart with joy to be back at Green Gables!"
00:31:58.875,00:32:01.461,But I feel they could send me away at any moment.
00:32:03.671,00:32:06.299,"But now that it's all settled, why would they?"
00:32:09.469,00:32:13.264,I just don't want to get too attached. Not if it's all gonna disappear.
00:32:17.685,00:32:18.770,Catch.
00:32:34.410,00:32:43.836,"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved of you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends."
00:33:12.657,00:33:16.160,It's quite confounding. Why send her away just to retrieve her?
00:33:17.036,00:33:21.582,"Confounding, indeed. I hope those old Cuthberts aren't losing their marbles."
00:33:21.666,00:33:23.042,What do you mean?
00:33:23.751,00:33:25.753,-Stop it! -You stop it!
00:33:25.837,00:33:30.341,"I mean, I hope they aren't becoming addled, dear, as seniors are wont to do."
00:33:30.425,00:33:32.051,"They hardly want to, darling."
00:33:32.677,00:33:34.595,I don't like this biscuit.
00:33:34.679,00:33:35.930,Then don't eat it.
00:33:36.472,00:33:39.350,"Well, it can't be a peaceable household. It simply can't."
00:33:39.434,00:33:41.310,The girl is an orphan after all.
00:33:41.394,00:33:43.146,How does one know what one is getting?
00:33:43.229,00:33:44.897,-One doesn't. -Exactly.
00:33:44.981,00:33:47.025,It's not like she wanted to be an orphan.
00:33:47.108,00:33:49.569,"Well, of course not, dear. But she is."
00:33:56.617,00:33:57.827,"Uh, uh..."
00:34:14.802,00:34:18.765,"Here we are. Here we all are! Glad to see you, Matthew."
00:34:20.308,00:34:21.392,"Welcome home, Anne."
00:34:21.476,00:34:22.935,"Thank you, Mrs. Lynde."
00:34:23.561,00:34:25.021,"How do you do, Mr. Lynde?"
00:34:25.104,00:34:26.939,Glad we didn't find you in a ditch.
00:34:27.023,00:34:29.400,"Yes, yes, dear. Everyone appreciates your gallantry."
00:34:29.484,00:34:30.860,"Well, we aim to please."
00:34:39.619,00:34:41.746,now that you're all reunited.
00:34:41.829,00:34:43.790,One big happy family.
00:34:46.000,00:34:48.336,Looks like the Cuthberts have picked up a stray.
00:34:52.757,00:34:55.635,Do you suppose they mean for her to be a daughter or a servant?
00:34:55.718,00:34:57.303,Doesn't she have awful red hair?
00:34:57.386,00:34:59.388,I wonder if she'll be attending school.
00:34:59.472,00:35:01.015,What is the world coming to?
00:35:05.812,00:35:07.188,A lunatic asylum?
00:35:07.271,00:35:08.439,Orphanage.
00:35:08.940,00:35:12.151,But of course it could turn out to be one and the same.
00:35:13.820,00:35:17.198,They will just have to... persevere.
00:35:27.333,00:35:28.417,Anne!
00:35:31.170,00:35:32.171,I'll go.
00:36:09.375,00:36:10.418,Anne?
00:36:13.838,00:36:14.839,Anne...
00:36:14.922,00:36:18.968,Did you feel a sense of obligation? Is that it?
00:36:19.051,00:36:21.721,Because I would have been fine on my own!
00:36:21.804,00:36:23.222,Better than here!
00:36:24.348,00:36:27.977,Why would you send for me if you didn't even want me?
00:36:28.060,00:36:29.729,"But we do want you, Anne."
00:36:29.812,00:36:31.606,"Well, it's obvious you don't!"
00:36:33.357,00:36:35.484,I don't know what to do.
00:36:42.992,00:36:44.827,I have a question for you.
00:36:46.621,00:36:47.747,I wonder...
00:36:48.956,00:36:50.666,will you forgive me?
00:36:53.711,00:36:56.672,"I am very sorry, Anne."
00:36:59.050,00:37:01.552,"When the brooch went missing, I was quick to judge."
00:37:03.179,00:37:05.681,But what's worse is that I pushed you to fib.
00:37:05.765,00:37:07.475,What else were you to do?
00:37:09.560,00:37:11.479,Makes me shudder to think of it.
00:37:13.689,00:37:16.651,And of course I know now that you were telling the truth.
00:37:17.318,00:37:23.991,"You are a truthful girl, Anne, even now, and that is an admirable quality."
00:37:36.128,00:37:37.255,This was my fault.
00:37:38.547,00:37:40.925,And all that you went through because of it.
00:37:41.008,00:37:43.844,It's a wonder you came back to Green Gables at all.
00:38:20.131,00:38:25.469,If you could find it in your heart to believe me...
00:38:26.137,00:38:28.889,and forgive me...
00:38:30.850,00:38:34.186,then we can start anew.
00:39:03.132,00:39:05.051,Please come down to the parlor.
00:39:07.303,00:39:09.221,And Marilla is just fine.
00:39:09.305,00:39:10.514,What do you mean?
00:39:10.598,00:39:12.099,You may call me Marilla.
00:39:12.892,00:39:14.018,Oh.
00:39:14.352,00:39:15.811,May I call you Aunt Marilla?
00:39:15.895,00:39:17.229,You may not!
00:39:17.313,00:39:19.357,"Oh, but I'd love to call you Aunt Marilla."
00:39:19.440,00:39:22.401,It would make me seem as if I really belonged to you.
00:39:22.485,00:39:24.403,"Well, I am not your aunt."
00:39:24.487,00:39:26.947,I don't believe in calling people names that don't belong to them.
00:39:27.031,00:39:30.242,"-Well, we could imagine you're my aunt. -I couldn't."
00:39:30.993,00:39:33.662,Do you never imagine things are different than they are?
00:39:33.746,00:39:34.997,I do not.
00:39:36.123,00:39:38.459,"Oh, Marilla, how much you miss."
00:39:39.877,00:39:46.217,"Well, speaking of names, we'd like you to sign this and take ours."
00:39:46.759,00:39:48.594,If the idea appeals to you.
00:39:51.263,00:39:53.265,I've got the pen. It's all ready for you.
00:39:54.600,00:39:56.268,This is your family Bible.
00:40:00.022,00:40:01.774,You want me to be a Cuthbert?
00:40:01.857,00:40:03.776,A-A real Cuthbert?
00:40:03.859,00:40:04.819,We do.
00:40:05.403,00:40:07.655,We want our name to belong to you.
00:40:08.614,00:40:09.907,I'm going to belong?
00:40:15.704,00:40:16.705,Anne?
00:40:17.289,00:40:19.083,I do. I-I do very much.
00:40:20.084,00:40:21.210,But...
00:40:21.710,00:40:23.671,I just sign? That's it?
00:40:24.338,00:40:26.924,Of course. What's the matter?
00:40:27.508,00:40:30.553,"Well, it seems a little perfunctory, don't you think?"
00:40:31.178,00:40:32.054,Perfunctory?
00:40:34.056,00:40:35.224,"Well, shouldn't we...?"
00:40:35.808,00:40:40.855,"Shouldn't we hold hands over a running stream, and-and pledge ourselves to each other as Cuthberts forever?"
00:40:41.689,00:40:45.901,Or prick our fingers and mingle our blood as a symbol of our lasting devotion?
00:40:48.988,00:40:54.285,"Well, surely there needs to be a ceremony of-of some kind in honor of an auspicious moment?"
00:40:55.578,00:41:01.876,"As someone who has never belonged to anyone before, I believe that this is a matter of much solemnity."
00:41:02.460,00:41:03.335,Don't you?
00:41:09.508,00:41:11.051,"What say you, Marilla?"
00:41:12.511,00:41:16.182,"Well, I've got some raspberry cordial in the pantry."
00:41:16.265,00:41:21.312,"Perhaps we could all have a small glass to celebrate, without any danger to anyone."
00:41:21.395,00:41:22.688,"Oh, Miss Cuth..."
00:41:23.564,00:41:25.024,"Thank you, Marilla."
00:41:25.107,00:41:26.609,That would do nicely.
00:41:28.110,00:41:29.195,"Well, then..."
00:41:29.278,00:41:30.946,to the Cuthberts.
00:41:31.697,00:41:34.492,-The Cuthberts. -And the Shirley-Cuthberts.
00:41:38.871,00:41:40.039,Oh...
00:41:40.122,00:41:42.458,I could develop a fondness for this.
00:41:45.085,00:41:47.171,"It's time for you to sign now, Anne."
00:41:49.381,00:41:50.508,Uh...
00:41:57.890,00:41:59.183,"Oh, my."
00:42:01.310,00:42:03.729,I can't believe this is really happening.
00:42:04.939,00:42:07.358,"Calm yourself, Anne. You're overexcited."
00:42:07.441,00:42:08.609,"Yes, I am."
00:42:11.737,00:42:14.615,I don't think I've ever been so excited in my whole life.
00:42:17.993,00:42:19.787,"Oh, my hands are shaking."
00:42:24.333,00:42:25.834,With this pen...
00:42:27.044,00:42:31.382,"I take you, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert..."
00:42:33.551,00:42:35.427,...to be my family forever.
00:42:38.305,00:42:42.226,To call you mine and to be yours.
00:42:43.269,00:42:44.270,For always.
00:42:52.152,00:42:53.362,Anne...
00:42:56.699,00:42:58.450,Cuthbert.
00:43:00.995,00:43:02.621,"Oh, I should add the Shirley."
00:43:02.705,00:43:04.623,I'll do it over.
00:43:10.170,00:43:11.463,Cuthbert.
00:43:15.384,00:43:17.469,"It should be hyphenated, don't you agree?"
00:43:18.429,00:43:26.186,"I'll add that in, too, and since it's official, it should probably be Anne Shirley-Cuthbert of Green Gables née Halifax."
00:43:26.270,00:43:27.521,Anne!
00:43:28.022,00:43:31.609,"Could I add Cordelia, too? I've always wanted to be a Cordelia."
00:43:32.276,00:43:35.654,Anne... Cordelia...
00:43:35.738,00:43:37.865,All right. That's enough now.
00:00:45.003,00:00:46.212,Anne!
00:01:06.316,00:01:11.196,"I expect it's perfectly normal to be nervous on your first day, but I'm sure everything will be fine."
00:01:11.863,00:01:15.492,"I don't have much experience with school, but why wouldn't it be fine?"
00:01:15.575,00:01:18.244,Better than fine. I have no doubt that it will be.
00:01:18.328,00:01:20.246,None at all.
00:01:20.830,00:01:22.373,I'm a few years behind...
00:01:23.500,00:01:25.919,but that's no reason not to be optimistic.
00:01:26.503,00:01:30.256,"The only place I can go from here, academically speaking, is up."
00:01:30.799,00:01:36.721,"If a person puts their best foot forward, things can go well-- Slow those feet down, please."
00:01:38.723,00:01:41.100,It will be nice to have a lot of new friends.
00:01:41.184,00:01:45.814,"Although, I expect it will be difficult to find a toehold, since they've probably known each other forever."
00:01:45.897,00:01:53.863,Going to school is my lifelong dream. What could possibly go wr-- Please let that not be portentous.
00:01:53.947,00:01:56.574,"For heaven's sake, Anne, I told you to slow down."
00:01:56.658,00:01:57.951,I'll fetch a broom.
00:01:58.785,00:02:01.704,"-I'm sorry, Marilla. -You'll do just fine today."
00:02:02.455,00:02:05.291,You are as smart as the dickens.
00:02:05.375,00:02:09.087,"Oh, I'm not so worried about my brain. I believe it to be in good working order."
00:02:09.170,00:02:10.088,Hm.
00:02:10.171,00:02:13.091,"And with any luck, I'll catch up with the rest of the class quite quickly."
00:02:13.174,00:02:14.425,That's not really my concern.
00:02:15.009,00:02:17.345,Do you want to know what my big concern is?
00:02:17.428,00:02:19.430,My overriding concern?
00:02:24.018,00:02:26.729,It's this awful red hair.
00:02:26.813,00:02:29.440,This horrible hideous horrible red hair!
00:02:30.024,00:02:31.943,It's the bane of my existence.
00:02:32.026,00:02:36.948,"Anne Shirley-Cuthbert, I suggest you find a worthier overriding concern."
00:02:37.031,00:02:38.658,And my freckles.
00:02:38.741,00:02:40.743,I hate my freckles.
00:02:40.827,00:02:44.247,And I can't help but think the children would like me better if I was pretty.
00:02:44.330,00:02:45.665,Fiddlesticks!
00:02:46.207,00:02:48.501,You're a vain one and no mistake.
00:02:48.585,00:02:52.463,"If a rose wasn't beautiful, nobody would want to stop and smell it."
00:02:53.214,00:02:55.508,"And, besides, how can I be vain if I'm ugly?"
00:02:55.592,00:02:57.510,"Oh, enough of your foolishness."
00:02:58.469,00:03:03.433,You'll do just fine at school if you stop your yammering and fortify yourself.
00:04:17.757,00:04:18.841,"Why, hello there."
00:04:19.634,00:04:21.970,I'm ever so pleased to make your acquaintances.
00:04:22.053,00:04:23.638,Greetings. No.
00:04:24.264,00:04:25.473,Salutations.
00:04:27.141,00:04:29.519,"Oh, your dress is splendid!"
00:04:29.602,00:04:31.145,Puff sleeves are divine!
00:04:34.357,00:04:36.567,Have you always lived in Avonlea?
00:04:37.151,00:04:41.197,"Oh, I agree. I believe it to be the most beautiful place on the Earth."
00:04:41.281,00:04:43.074,And I've traveled a fair deal.
00:04:43.700,00:04:46.202,It gives one a worldly perspective.
00:04:46.286,00:04:50.623,"Oh, this old thing? I adore wild flowers, don't you?"
00:04:50.707,00:04:54.711,Sometimes I like to imagine that my room is a flowery bower.
00:04:55.295,00:04:59.757,Did you know that a bower is a lady's private apartment in a medieval hall or castle?
00:05:01.134,00:05:03.594,Wouldn't it be wonderful to be a princess?
00:05:04.804,00:05:08.141,Words cannot express how thrilling it is to make your acquaintance.
00:05:45.428,00:05:46.763,"Hello, Diana!"
00:05:48.931,00:05:51.434,"My, what have you done to your hat?"
00:05:51.517,00:05:55.313,"Well, I wanted to make a good first impression, and it was so plain."
00:05:58.399,00:06:01.819,I'm glad you found your way. I expect we should be able to walk together soon.
00:06:01.903,00:06:03.112,We can't?
00:06:03.738,00:06:06.866,"I'm sure it won't be long until my parents accept you, now that you're a Cuthbert."
00:06:07.825,00:06:09.535,Welcome to the first day of school.
00:06:10.161,00:06:12.622,Come on. I'll show you everything you need to know.
00:06:13.039,00:06:14.332,I wonder who that is?
00:06:15.917,00:06:17.543,Leave your hat and sweater here.
00:06:18.169,00:06:19.462,You can sit with me.
00:06:19.545,00:06:20.713,Ruby won't mind.
00:06:20.797,00:06:27.678,"I think Jane and Ruby may sit together, now that Prissy's studying for Queen's Academy entrance exams, and needs to sit with the older students."
00:06:33.476,00:06:34.894,Hello there. I'm Moody.
00:06:34.977,00:06:37.522,"-Oh, I'm sorry. -Moody Spurgeon."
00:06:40.942,00:06:43.444,-Charlie Sloane. -Happy to meet you.
00:06:44.153,00:06:45.655,Don't talk to the boys.
00:06:45.738,00:06:47.323,They're ridiculous.
00:06:47.406,00:06:49.033,"Nice to see you, too, Diana."
00:06:52.995,00:06:55.957,"He's dreamy, but he won't be here today."
00:06:59.669,00:07:03.422,This is Jane Andrews and Josie Pye and Ruby Gillis and Tillie Boulter.
00:07:03.506,00:07:05.508,"Everybody, this is Anne."
00:07:05.591,00:07:07.260,"-Hello, Anne. -Hello."
00:07:07.343,00:07:08.344,Nice to meet you.
00:07:17.103,00:07:21.232,"Uh... Anne loves to read, and she knows ever so many big words."
00:07:25.778,00:07:27.238,"I like to read, too."
00:07:28.156,00:07:29.574,"No, you don't."
00:07:31.200,00:07:32.410,"No, I don't."
00:07:32.493,00:07:36.330,"I saw you at the church picnic. I'm sorry, I should have said hello."
00:07:36.414,00:07:38.374,There were an awful lot of people there.
00:07:38.458,00:07:40.001,Mother wouldn't let me.
00:07:46.549,00:07:50.219,"If you're an orphan, I suppose. I wouldn't be caught dead in it."
00:07:51.637,00:07:54.223,Anne isn't an orphan anymore. She's been adopted.
00:07:54.307,00:07:57.101,"I'm... still an orphan, Diana."
00:07:59.979,00:08:01.731,I'd hate to be an orphan.
00:08:01.814,00:08:03.691,"I feel real sorry for you, Anne."
00:08:03.774,00:08:06.194,Ruff-ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
00:08:06.861,00:08:08.779,You're ridiculous.
00:08:11.824,00:08:14.202,"-Can you fetch, too? -Billy, leave her be."
00:08:18.331,00:08:21.042,Don't mind my brother. He's ridiculous!
00:08:21.626,00:08:22.460,Ruff!
00:08:24.420,00:08:26.506,Never let the boys know when they've upset you.
00:08:27.089,00:08:29.342,"Never let them know when you like them, either."
00:08:30.551,00:08:33.554,School... is a lot to contend with.
00:08:33.638,00:08:38.976,"Have you ever been to a real school, or did they just send you to special orphan school?"
00:08:41.062,00:08:43.189,"Come on, Anne. Let's finish the tour."
00:08:43.272,00:08:45.816,Bring your milk. I'll show you the stream outside.
00:09:04.210,00:09:06.629,"-Good morning, Miss Cuthbert. -Good morning."
00:09:06.712,00:09:11.092,"I don't think we've ever been formally introduced, but, of course, I know you from town and church."
00:09:11.175,00:09:13.010,"It's Mrs. Bell, isn't it?"
00:09:13.094,00:09:15.096,"Yes, and this is Mrs. Andrews."
00:09:15.179,00:09:16.847,-Nice to know you. -How do you do?
00:09:17.682,00:09:18.933,How may I help you?
00:09:19.016,00:09:21.310,We're here on behalf of the PMSC.
00:09:21.394,00:09:23.563,The Progressive Mothers' Sewing Circle.
00:09:23.646,00:09:27.525,You might have heard of us. We've been meeting twice a month for over two years.
00:09:28.401,00:09:31.487,Of course. I'd be happy to make a small donation.
00:09:31.571,00:09:36.117,"Oh... Oh, no. Thank you kindly, but we're not a charity. We're an organization."
00:09:36.200,00:09:39.787,-An informal organization. -But an organization nonetheless.
00:09:39.870,00:09:42.623,Mothers who gather to discuss the education of our young girls.
00:09:42.707,00:09:45.167,"-We also do needlepoint. -And tea is served, of course."
00:09:46.085,00:09:48.170,That sounds stimulating.
00:09:48.254,00:09:52.466,"Now that you're mother to a young girl, we're wondering if you'd like to attend."
00:09:53.217,00:09:54.302,Oh...
00:09:54.385,00:09:57.513,We should warn you that our viewpoints are forward-thinking.
00:09:58.306,00:10:02.727,We believe that a woman's education is just as important as a man's.
00:10:02.810,00:10:04.979,"Oh, that is admirable."
00:10:05.688,00:10:09.734,Now that your... ward... your-- Anne.
00:10:09.817,00:10:17.408,"Since your Anne is part of our community now, and you'll be raising her, we wanted to extend the invitation for you to join us."
00:10:17.992,00:10:20.578,We're meeting at the Andrews' home this afternoon.
00:10:20.661,00:10:21.871,Will you come?
00:10:23.122,00:10:25.791,"Set your milk down next to mine, so they'll stay cold."
00:10:26.876,00:10:30.338,I must have done something wrong just then. I don't know what it was.
00:10:30.421,00:10:32.506,Let me tell you all the things to know about lunch.
00:10:32.590,00:10:34.342,All the girls in our clique sit together.
00:10:34.425,00:10:36.719,We make a kind of clubhouse with no boys allowed.
00:10:36.802,00:10:40.097,"I usually sit next to Jane, but sometimes Jane sits with her big sister Prissy."
00:10:43.309,00:10:46.145,"You'll need to gauge the situation, since we always sit the same way."
00:10:46.228,00:10:48.856,"Everybody shows what they brought, and we divide it equally."
00:10:48.939,00:10:51.359,Anyone who doesn't share is considered awful mean.
00:10:51.442,00:10:54.987,"I hope you brought enough for everyone, since it won't do to eat without sharing."
00:11:01.410,00:11:03.871,"-What'd you bring, Anne? -Josie Pye doesn't like me at all."
00:11:03.954,00:11:07.750,I brought a lace-trimmed handkerchief. It should make a lovely presentation.
00:11:07.833,00:11:10.461,Hopefully your apple is already sliced for sharing.
00:11:10.544,00:11:13.089,-Apple? I... I... -Come on. I'll show you the rest.
00:11:19.261,00:11:23.015,Avonlea schooling is very progressive. We have a second room for the youngsters.
00:11:25.810,00:11:29.230,"Hello. All right, uh, take your seats."
00:11:31.565,00:11:33.567,"Diana, what kind of sums are those?"
00:11:34.276,00:11:35.611,"Long division, of course."
00:11:36.445,00:11:37.905,Long division?
00:11:37.988,00:11:39.532,"So easy, right?"
00:11:39.615,00:11:41.033,Those were the days.
00:11:41.117,00:11:42.118,Come on.
00:11:44.203,00:11:45.871,And this is the supply room.
00:11:45.955,00:11:49.667,But you need to ask permission before you take anything. Even during recess.
00:11:56.757,00:11:57.800,"Well, I'll be!"
00:11:59.009,00:12:03.097,"That's... that's Prissy Andrews and the teacher, Mr. Phillips."
00:12:03.180,00:12:05.641,-Are they married? -Of course not.
00:12:06.475,00:12:08.769,She's a student and he's old.
00:12:09.812,00:12:12.898,-They're touching. -They must be making a baby.
00:12:12.982,00:12:14.275,What?
00:12:14.358,00:12:17.486,"Well, if they're touching, that means they're having intimate relations."
00:12:17.570,00:12:18.654,Really?
00:12:19.155,00:12:21.574,It seems to me a lot of husbands have a pet mouse.
00:12:22.450,00:12:23.868,Pet mouse?
00:12:29.248,00:12:30.082,Yes.
00:12:30.166,00:12:32.710,"So I expect Mr. Phillips has one, too, in his front pants pocket."
00:12:32.793,00:12:35.921,I expect Prissy Andrews has made its acquaintance.
00:12:36.005,00:12:41.510,"Mrs. Hammond, she's a lady I used to work for, she said she always had twins after she pet Mr. Hammond's mouse."
00:13:24.345,00:13:26.347,"Moody, stand and deliver."
00:13:45.533,00:13:49.662,"Moody, it has an A in it, right after the E, but the A is silent."
00:13:49.745,00:13:53.791,"Yes, the A is silent, as you should be."
00:13:53.874,00:13:56.210,"You're the, um, orphan, yes?"
00:13:56.293,00:13:59.755,"My name is Anne Shirley-Cuthbert, and please spell Anne with an E."
00:13:59.838,00:14:02.424,-Did I call on you? -You-You just asked me a question.
00:14:02.508,00:14:06.220,Did I call on you?
00:14:07.263,00:14:09.473,-No. -Then sit down.
00:14:23.028,00:14:26.699,"There's, uh, bread and cheese in the pantry for your lunch."
00:14:26.782,00:14:29.159,I expect I'll be back well before milking.
00:14:29.243,00:14:31.287,I daresay this meeting takes a bite out of the day.
00:14:31.370,00:14:32.997,"You sure about this, Marilla?"
00:14:33.080,00:14:38.836,"Well, I can't say I quite know what I got myself into, but, well, there's no harm in learning something new."
00:14:39.962,00:14:43.090,"Seeing as how we're parents, and all."
00:14:44.049,00:14:45.634,In case it escaped your notice.
00:14:45.718,00:14:49.722,"Eh, up until now, I hadn't really... thought of it that way."
00:14:49.805,00:14:51.557,"Well, there's truth to it."
00:14:52.349,00:14:53.976,So you'd better get used to the idea.
00:15:16.665,00:15:17.791,Anne!
00:15:19.084,00:15:20.252,Come here!
00:15:24.381,00:15:26.550,I thought lunchtime would never arrive.
00:15:26.634,00:15:27.968,I feel the same way!
00:15:28.052,00:15:30.429,I'm just so excited to hear about everything that you saw!
00:15:30.512,00:15:32.264,-Me too. -Me three!
00:15:32.348,00:15:33.933,What do you mean?
00:15:34.016,00:15:37.770,"Prissy and Mr. Phillips, silly. In the supply room."
00:15:37.853,00:15:40.397,I told them about the pet mouse.
00:15:40.481,00:15:42.274,It's just all so shocking.
00:15:42.358,00:15:45.694,"I wasn't too sure about it, though, so I thought maybe you could tell them."
00:15:47.071,00:15:49.198,-I just can't believe it! -Me neither!
00:15:49.907,00:15:52.826,"Prissy and Mr. Phillips are having intimate relations, all right!"
00:15:56.246,00:16:00.960,"But you don't really think she touched it, do you?"
00:16:01.043,00:16:02.378,His pet mouse?
00:16:04.838,00:16:06.966,-I spy with my little eye... -Go away!
00:16:11.136,00:16:13.013,Are they really making a baby?
00:16:14.014,00:16:16.183,It's disgusting. He's the teacher.
00:16:16.266,00:16:19.728,-Prissy does look grown-up this year. -Do you think they're in love?
00:16:19.812,00:16:22.439,"When it comes to intimate relations, I'm not sure it matters."
00:16:24.316,00:16:25.609,"Oh, my!"
00:16:26.568,00:16:27.736,"Do tell, Anne."
00:16:27.820,00:16:33.492,"Well, in my experience with Mrs. Hammond and her drunken husband-- -Drunken husband? -Oh, my!"
00:16:34.368,00:16:36.578,They're the people you lived with before?
00:16:36.662,00:16:38.497,"They were the last ones, yes."
00:16:38.580,00:16:42.292,"-And he was a drunkard? -Oh, indeed."
00:16:42.376,00:16:45.045,"-Oh, Anne... -Mr. Hammond always had his moonshine."
00:16:45.129,00:16:51.385,"And after he'd partaken, he would stomp around the house like Frankenstein's monster, and everybody would run."
00:16:51.468,00:16:55.806,"But nobody faster than Mrs. Hammond, because she knew he was going to make her pet his mouse."
00:16:55.889,00:16:58.434,-And did she? -I believe she had to.
00:16:59.893,00:17:00.894,"Oh, my."
00:17:00.978,00:17:02.688,I could hear everything!
00:17:03.897,00:17:04.898,Everything?
00:17:04.982,00:17:07.359,"To this day, I don't know quite what to make of it."
00:17:07.443,00:17:14.074,"There were times I heard laughing, and it sounded like fun, but there were other times I was sure he was murdering her!"
00:17:14.575,00:17:17.077,"Either way, it sure made Mrs. Hammond mad."
00:17:21.915,00:17:24.501,I'll confess that I was relieved when Mr. Hammond dropped dead.
00:17:24.585,00:17:26.754,I didn't miss the sting of his belt one bit.
00:17:29.965,00:17:34.803,-Is lunchtime over already? -No. I won't eat next to dirty trash.
00:17:34.887,00:17:37.973,"Come on, girls, before we all become tarnished."
00:17:46.023,00:17:47.024,Diana?
00:17:47.900,00:17:48.734,I...
00:17:53.697,00:17:56.867,"Oh, dear. Let me go see if there's anything to be done."
00:18:05.918,00:18:10.547,"My sister has written to me about our current book, The Grasshoppers by Mrs. Andrew Dean."
00:18:10.631,00:18:12.007,Her sister is a suffragette.
00:18:12.091,00:18:15.886,She regularly sends me progressive periodicals from Acadia University.
00:18:15.969,00:18:17.304,Which she attended.
00:18:17.387,00:18:24.520,My sister writes that the book reviewer for The Athenaeum described this story as a woman's flirtation with feminism.
00:18:24.603,00:18:28.023,Feminism. What an incredible word.
00:18:28.107,00:18:29.483,How very intriguing.
00:18:29.566,00:18:31.068,But what exactly does it mean?
00:18:31.151,00:18:36.073,I loved this story. It changed my thinking about higher education for women.
00:18:36.657,00:18:40.744,My mother still believes it's scandalous for women to attend college.
00:18:40.828,00:18:42.037,It's a forbidden topic.
00:18:42.121,00:18:45.582,"We're also an informal book club, in case you hadn't noticed."
00:18:45.666,00:18:48.293,"You can be next in line to read this, after Margaret, if you like."
00:18:48.919,00:18:50.003,Thank you.
00:18:50.087,00:18:52.381,"Oh, I hope you're a girl."
00:18:52.464,00:18:55.509,You'll be a modern woman in a modern society.
00:18:58.428,00:19:01.265,My mother was quite disappointed when I came along.
00:19:01.348,00:19:03.016,She only wanted boys.
00:19:03.100,00:19:05.561,"Well, your farm is exceedingly large."
00:19:05.644,00:19:08.814,And now your Prissy is sitting for her college entrance exams.
00:19:08.897,00:19:11.692,I want her to have every advantage in life.
00:19:11.775,00:19:13.026,And Jane.
00:19:13.110,00:19:15.529,You see? That's feminism.
00:19:16.572,00:19:18.657,"Good for you, Miss Cuthbert, for choosing a girl."
00:19:19.241,00:19:20.951,It's very forward-thinking.
00:19:22.244,00:19:24.496,"Treat yourself, while you still have time."
00:19:27.666,00:19:30.711,And-And you're educating her. Is she quite bright?
00:19:30.794,00:19:34.339,"Oh, well, Anne's inquisitive, that's for sure and certain."
00:19:34.882,00:19:36.175,She loves to read.
00:19:36.717,00:19:39.094,She has a real appetite for learning.
00:19:39.178,00:19:41.722,Are you hoping she'll go into one of the feminine professions?
00:19:44.057,00:19:45.267,Perhaps so.
00:19:45.934,00:19:48.604,This is why we must strive to improve the curriculum for girls.
00:19:48.687,00:19:51.064,Especially for those who are unlikely to marry.
00:19:54.318,00:19:56.361,and perhaps compiling a list of suggestions...
00:19:58.530,00:20:02.534,-Goodbye. -I miss you already.
00:20:14.087,00:20:16.673,"Come along, Anne. I can walk you partway home."
00:20:22.387,00:20:25.307,There must be a limit to the mistakes one person can make.
00:20:25.390,00:20:28.268,"And when I get to the end of them, then I'll be through with them."
00:20:28.727,00:20:30.312,It's a very comforting thought.
00:20:30.395,00:20:34.274,Don't worry. I'm sure the girls will come around to liking you real soon.
00:20:38.153,00:20:40.447,And... no mice.
00:20:42.783,00:20:44.076,"See you tomorrow, Anne."
00:21:25.784,00:21:28.245,And then when I heard you attended one of their...
00:21:28.829,00:21:30.205,their whatever-you-call-its...
00:21:30.289,00:21:31.290,Meeting.
00:21:31.373,00:21:33.792,"...you could've knocked me over with a feather, that's what."
00:21:34.459,00:21:36.086,I'm mystified by you.
00:21:36.503,00:21:39.965,"Shocked and mystified. Marilla Cuthbert, suffragette!"
00:21:40.048,00:21:42.592,"-Oh, for heaven's sake! -A progressive mother!"
00:21:43.427,00:21:45.804,I'm still a bit surprised about the mother part myself.
00:21:45.887,00:21:49.016,"Well, don't ask me for my advice. I've only had ten children!"
00:21:52.936,00:21:56.523,Tell me everything. I mean it. Don't leave out a single detail.
00:21:56.606,00:21:58.775,"If you're so curious, you should consider attending."
00:21:59.401,00:22:02.154,Why on earth would I join a group of young mothers?
00:22:04.323,00:22:06.950,"Tea, please. I must have fortification."
00:22:10.704,00:22:12.706,It was a lively discussion.
00:22:13.290,00:22:17.169,Lively. Did you each take turns shouting atop a soapbox?
00:22:17.252,00:22:21.798,There was a lot of civilized talk about women's education and social reforms.
00:22:21.882,00:22:25.552,Next you'll tell me you burnt your corsets and danced naked at town hall!
00:22:26.553,00:22:27.554,We ran out of time.
00:22:30.849,00:22:32.851,"Admittedly, I felt rather at sea."
00:22:33.643,00:22:35.896,"There's so much changing, these days."
00:22:36.688,00:22:38.940,So much I'd never thought about before.
00:22:39.024,00:22:41.693,Not that you'd ever even thought about being a mother until Anne.
00:22:41.777,00:22:43.028,That's what I'm saying.
00:22:45.405,00:22:47.324,What if I'm not equal to the task?
00:22:47.407,00:22:49.201,Motherhood is simple.
00:22:49.284,00:22:52.704,Controversial ideas just complicate the matter unnecessarily.
00:22:53.205,00:22:56.166,Matthew... did you condone this little adventure?
00:22:56.249,00:22:57.542,Huh?
00:22:57.626,00:22:58.794,I just come in for tea.
00:22:58.877,00:23:01.797,"Oh, so you were just fine and dandy with Marilla traipsing off."
00:23:01.880,00:23:03.632,Don't put him in the middle.
00:23:03.715,00:23:07.385,"I'll, uh... I'll just, uh, take it outside with me."
00:23:07.469,00:23:10.472,I'd like to hear what he makes of all this modern thinking.
00:23:10.555,00:23:11.723,Um...
00:23:12.599,00:23:16.144,I reckon every new idea was modern once.
00:23:16.645,00:23:18.063,Until it wasn't.
00:23:22.651,00:23:23.860,Well.
00:23:26.279,00:23:28.323,"Well. Well, well."
00:23:41.128,00:23:42.546,"Hi there. Hi, Jerry."
00:23:54.307,00:23:57.936,You've become a woman of drastic actions of late.
00:23:58.019,00:23:59.604,I barely know you anymore.
00:23:59.688,00:24:04.067,You know there's a difference between having an opinion about something and pronouncing judgment!
00:24:05.277,00:24:07.279,I'm not sorry I went to that meeting.
00:24:08.155,00:24:11.324,Even if it did serve to point out everything that I don't know.
00:24:12.325,00:24:15.912,I feel I need to expand my thinking if I'm gonna do right by Anne.
00:24:15.996,00:24:19.082,"That girl is not a usual sort of person, that's for sure and certain."
00:24:19.166,00:24:20.542,"Well, at least we can agree on that."
00:24:23.461,00:24:25.714,The two of you are an inspiration!
00:24:25.797,00:24:28.383,To think that you've been friends since school.
00:24:28.884,00:24:30.886,Kindred spirits forever.
00:24:30.969,00:24:33.180,How do you do it? W-What's your secret?
00:24:34.306,00:24:35.891,How was your first day at school?
00:24:35.974,00:24:39.686,"I think it went really, really well. Very well. I'm just so happy to be there."
00:24:39.769,00:24:42.772,"I'll just put my things away, and then I'll be down to help you with supper!"
00:24:51.114,00:24:53.033,Keep me posted about the next meeting.
00:24:54.409,00:24:55.619,If you like.
00:24:56.745,00:24:58.330,I'd be happy to offer my opinion.
00:24:58.413,00:25:00.415,I have no doubt you will.
00:25:24.147,00:25:27.108,It must be like backwards multiplication.
00:25:27.859,00:25:29.569,It can't be that hard to figure out.
00:25:54.636,00:25:56.513,Today will be better.
00:25:57.222,00:26:01.977,"I'm not gonna say anything weird, or... or do anything wrong."
00:26:03.520,00:26:05.480,"You're my friend, right, Belle?"
00:26:06.273,00:26:08.775,"You'll always be my friend, won't you?"
00:26:10.068,00:26:12.988,You bet. I'm so flattered.
00:26:13.071,00:26:15.448,"-You shouldn't eavesdrop, Jerry. -You what?"
00:26:25.125,00:26:27.210,I just have to remember what Jane Eyre said.
00:26:27.585,00:26:33.258,"Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity, or registering wrongs."
00:26:35.760,00:26:37.429,Anne of Green Gables.
00:26:38.305,00:26:40.724,"You and me, we're gonna talk."
00:26:42.100,00:26:44.311,You said some nasty stuff about my sister.
00:26:44.394,00:26:45.854,Who's your sister?
00:26:45.937,00:26:50.150,"-Prissy Andrews, dummy. -I'm sure I didn't mean to be nasty."
00:26:50.734,00:26:52.777,Is that why she was crying all night?
00:26:54.070,00:26:56.448,My parents say that's slander.
00:26:57.407,00:27:00.785,-You want to get slandered? -Sorry. I truly meant no harm. I...
00:27:02.454,00:27:04.289,"I'm gonna teach you a lesson, Fido."
00:27:05.040,00:27:06.249,You're a bad dog.
00:27:06.333,00:27:08.418,Bad little dog.
00:27:15.008,00:27:16.426,How's it going?
00:27:19.429,00:27:20.889,"Hey, Gilbert."
00:27:21.389,00:27:23.558,"Man, it's-it's, um, it's good to be back."
00:27:24.642,00:27:25.727,Uh...
00:27:26.644,00:27:28.772,"Yeah. Yeah, welcome back."
00:27:28.855,00:27:30.273,"Yeah, it's good to see you, buddy."
00:27:31.775,00:27:34.819,"So you guys, uh, playing a game or something, right?"
00:27:35.445,00:27:38.114,"Looks fun, but we should probably get to school, eh?"
00:27:39.574,00:27:43.119,Hate to be tardy. Mr. Phillips sure gets his dander up about that.
00:27:47.040,00:27:48.333,See you there.
00:27:52.003,00:27:53.129,"You all right, Miss?"
00:27:55.799,00:27:57.884,-School-- -You're welcome.
00:27:59.719,00:28:02.680,Need anything else? Any dragons around here need slaying?
00:28:05.975,00:28:07.268,Who are you?
00:28:09.354,00:28:10.814,"Hey, who are you?"
00:28:18.613,00:28:19.864,"Uh, Miss?"
00:28:20.657,00:28:22.450,"Uh, what's your name, Miss?"
00:28:24.494,00:28:26.246,"What, you can't tell me your name?"
00:28:36.631,00:28:38.049,"Here. Here, allow me."
00:28:39.050,00:28:40.051,Thank you.
00:28:45.014,00:28:48.184,I'm sorry if I was rude.
00:28:48.268,00:28:54.524,"-I'm Anne. -Uh, I'm-- -Hey! -How was the District of Alberta?"
00:29:02.449,00:29:04.826,"Uh, we're both glad to be back home."
00:29:05.410,00:29:07.787,Why were you walking with that orphan girl?
00:29:07.871,00:29:08.872,Why not?
00:29:15.003,00:29:17.589,Uh-oh. There's one!
00:29:19.466,00:29:21.634,"Besides, I don't care where she's from."
00:29:22.427,00:29:24.095,A cute girl is a cute girl.
00:29:29.142,00:29:32.562,I don't know what you think you were doing walking with Gilbert Blythe.
00:29:32.645,00:29:35.648,You can't talk to Gilbert Blythe. You can't even look at him.
00:29:35.732,00:29:37.150,"Well, see for yourself."
00:29:37.984,00:29:40.403,Ruby has liked him for three years.
00:29:40.487,00:29:41.821,She has dibs.
00:29:42.989,00:29:45.700,"There, there. That nasty girl didn't know any better."
00:29:46.326,00:29:48.620,Just like yesterday with all your tall tales.
00:29:48.703,00:29:51.873,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to walk with him. It just happened.
00:29:51.956,00:29:55.293,"-Well, don't let it happen again. -I won't. I promise."
00:29:55.376,00:29:57.086,I'll have nothing to do with him.
00:30:05.345,00:30:06.471,I'll try to smooth things over.
00:30:23.822,00:30:26.825,"Mrs. Bell, how nice to see you."
00:30:27.700,00:30:28.701,Hello.
00:30:28.785,00:30:31.246,I've been wondering when the next meeting is.
00:30:31.329,00:30:36.125,"Well, actually, Miss Cuthbert-- Oh, please call me Marilla. Everyone does."
00:30:36.209,00:30:37.418,Miss Cuthbert...
00:30:38.670,00:30:41.089,we feel that our group isn't the right fit for you.
00:30:45.844,00:30:47.345,I-I-I see.
00:30:47.428,00:30:50.932,We understand clearly now that Anne needs all of your attention.
00:30:51.015,00:30:52.517,You've got your hands full.
00:30:54.269,00:30:55.520,All my attention?
00:30:55.603,00:30:58.231,"Also, we urge you to consider home-schooling."
00:30:58.314,00:31:00.525,That would be best for all concerned.
00:31:00.608,00:31:03.903,And we are concerned. Good day to you.
00:31:17.166,00:31:18.793,that they don't want her back in school?
00:31:18.877,00:31:20.545,We'll know soon enough.
00:31:25.216,00:31:26.676,And they don't want you back.
00:31:27.844,00:31:29.470,"Leave me be, Matthew."
00:31:49.699,00:31:51.701,Open your readers to page 32.
00:31:52.577,00:31:56.664,"We will read aloud Barry Cornwall's poem, The Fisherman."
00:31:56.748,00:31:58.374,Finally! Something I can do well.
00:31:59.042,00:32:00.418,"I'm happy for you, Anne."
00:32:00.501,00:32:03.379,"Diana Barry, stand and begin."
00:32:11.679,00:32:24.609,"A per-i-lous life And sad as life may be Hath the lone fisher on the lonely sea-- Perilous, indeed. Sit down."
00:32:27.153,00:32:30.323,New girl. Up. Continue.
00:32:40.708,00:33:00.895,For some bleak pittance e'er compelled to roam Few hearts to cheer him through his dangerous life And none to aid him in the stormy strife Companion of the sea and silent air The lonely fisher thus must ever fare She's good. Invested.
00:33:00.979,00:33:09.070,"Without the comfort, hope, with scarce a friend He looks through life and only sees its end."
00:33:10.238,00:33:11.572,Sit down!
00:33:11.656,00:33:13.324,Sweet merciful Lord.
00:33:24.961,00:33:26.295,That was really different.
00:33:26.379,00:33:28.089,Josie Pye.
00:33:28.172,00:33:32.760,"Read Campbell's Pleasures of Hope, The Downfall of Poland."
00:33:45.982,00:33:48.317,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:33:48.651,00:33:51.738,"I've gotta fix a bit of fence down yonder, so..."
00:33:51.821,00:33:53.948,I've been meaning to attend to it.
00:33:54.032,00:33:55.575,Lunch is in an hour.
00:33:55.658,00:33:59.537,"Well, uh, I best get it done, you know, before I forget again."
00:34:00.121,00:34:02.582,"So I might, uh... I might be late."
00:34:03.416,00:34:05.084,"Jerry will, uh, help you unload."
00:34:08.838,00:34:10.798,"Walk on, Belle. Allons."
00:34:28.524,00:34:31.611,"Hey, um, I, uh, thought you might like to try one."
00:34:32.195,00:34:34.238,They're from our orchard. They're real sweet.
00:34:37.450,00:34:38.493,I beg your pardon?
00:34:43.915,00:34:48.169,"I'm-I'm sorry. I, uh-- I'm not supposed to talk to you!"
00:34:48.961,00:34:50.004,Why not?
00:35:13.361,00:35:16.864,"Well, as I live and breathe. Matthew Cuthbert, what are you doing here?"
00:35:17.573,00:35:18.991,Is everything all right?
00:35:20.785,00:35:21.619,Anne.
00:35:24.372,00:35:25.373,Yes.
00:35:28.668,00:35:31.796,Come on in. I know the whole story.
00:35:39.762,00:35:42.306,And the Andrews are fit to be tied.
00:35:47.270,00:35:50.481,and Rachel's reliable in the knowing department.
00:35:51.858,00:35:54.360,Dear Lord! That child will put me in the grave.
00:35:57.029,00:35:59.490,I cannot bear to think of her spewing such filth!
00:35:59.991,00:36:02.451,It worries me to no end.
00:36:03.161,00:36:04.412,What a disgrace!
00:36:05.663,00:36:08.624,"Wait until all of Avonlea hears about this, if they haven't already."
00:36:08.708,00:36:11.419,"I feel worried for Anne, is what."
00:36:13.087,00:36:17.091,"Matthew Cuthbert, I don't understand you at all."
00:36:18.134,00:36:20.553,-That child is-- -A child.
00:36:22.847,00:36:24.849,Burns me up.
00:36:26.392,00:36:29.437,"A girl of her tender age, she oughtn't to know such things."
00:37:08.809,00:37:12.521,"-Good afternoon, Mrs. Andrews. -Good afternoon, Miss Cuthbert."
00:37:12.605,00:37:15.024,"I've very sorry to disturb you, but..."
00:37:15.691,00:37:20.029,I wanted to have a word with you about Anne and your daughter Prissy.
00:37:20.112,00:37:28.037,"Forgive me if I don't invite you in, but seeing as your... girl set about sullying my daughter's good name, I'm sure you can understand."
00:37:29.163,00:37:34.585,I want to apologize for any discomfort this incident has caused Prissy and your family.
00:37:34.669,00:37:36.254,Discomfort?
00:37:36.337,00:37:38.464,My daughter is sorely aggrieved.
00:37:38.839,00:37:40.299,As am I.
00:37:40.383,00:37:44.095,This outrage will not be forgotten by anyone anytime soon.
00:37:44.178,00:37:46.055,We are dreadfully sorry.
00:37:46.681,00:37:48.516,I'm sure Anne didn't mean any harm.
00:37:48.599,00:37:51.560,-How would you know? -I beg your pardon?
00:37:51.644,00:37:53.396,Do you really know anything about her?
00:37:54.730,00:37:59.318,You didn't do Avonlea any favors bringing that... trollop into our midst.
00:37:59.402,00:38:02.071,-I beg your pardon? -I think you heard me plain.
00:38:02.905,00:38:09.161,"Well, hear this: you can hold Anne responsible for what she said-- I can and most certainly do."
00:38:09.245,00:38:13.541,But you can't hold against her what she's seen or been exposed to.
00:38:13.624,00:38:15.376,That's not her fault.
00:38:15.459,00:38:18.671,That child has endured more than any of us can know or imagine.
00:38:20.589,00:38:24.510,It's a shame progressive parenting doesn't seem to include compassion.
00:38:24.593,00:38:27.346,But perhaps you'll muster some up in church on Sunday...
00:38:27.930,00:38:32.018,and thank the good Lord that poor Anne has finally found safe haven.
00:38:34.812,00:38:36.063,Good day.
00:38:50.494,00:38:53.581,"-Did you go to school, Mr. Cuthbert? -Uh, for a time."
00:38:53.664,00:38:56.542,I left... when I was about your age.
00:38:57.126,00:38:59.128,Do you know a word called eedrope?
00:39:00.087,00:39:01.172,Eedrope?
00:39:02.548,00:39:04.008,Anne told me not to do it.
00:39:04.091,00:39:05.843,Eedrope?
00:39:07.470,00:39:09.638,"Oh, I don't think I know that one."
00:39:10.765,00:39:14.352,But I never saw Anne's beat for knowing big words.
00:39:16.437,00:39:18.230,I bet she does very well at school.
00:40:12.410,00:40:13.619,Whoops.
00:40:18.040,00:40:19.250,Hey.
00:40:35.224,00:40:36.267,You just did.
00:40:43.482,00:40:45.818,Get up here now!
00:40:52.283,00:40:54.493,Is this what they taught you in that orphanage?
00:40:55.327,00:40:56.495,Unacceptable!
00:41:13.387,00:41:18.058,"Now, stand here and stay put, and the rest of you pipe down!"
00:41:18.767,00:41:28.068,"Let this serve as a lesson to you that we do not tolerate such displays of temper, here in a civilized society."
00:41:28.152,00:41:29.361,It was my fault.
00:41:30.029,00:41:31.697,"Sir, I, um... I-I teased her."
00:41:31.780,00:41:34.575,"Quiet, Blythe. That is hardly an excuse."
00:41:35.659,00:41:38.454,"Quiet, all of you, and return to your lesson."
00:41:40.831,00:41:44.835,"Thirty minus six, divided by three equals..."
00:41:59.058,00:42:00.726,Where do you think you're going?
00:42:02.061,00:42:03.437,Get back here.
00:42:10.444,00:42:11.695,Get back here.
00:42:19.787,00:42:20.996,Shirley!
00:42:48.315,00:42:49.358,Anne!
00:43:06.083,00:43:07.876,"There, there, child."
00:43:09.420,00:43:10.588,I know.
00:43:11.422,00:43:13.007,I know just how you feel.
00:43:14.174,00:43:16.135,You've been judged harshly.
00:43:19.471,00:43:22.266,I am never going back to school!
00:43:22.349,00:43:23.684,Never!
00:00:56.306,00:00:57.307,Merci.
00:01:27.962,00:01:29.923,Isn't she supposed to be collecting the eggs?
00:01:32.717,00:01:34.928,you may have to send us both to the loony bin.
00:02:22.225,00:02:25.228,And you'll need to test the pie's doneness with a small knife.
00:02:25.311,00:02:26.312,I will.
00:02:26.396,00:02:29.065,"Watch the clock carefully, Anne, so as not to burn it."
00:02:29.149,00:02:30.150,I will.
00:02:30.233,00:02:34.362,I don't want to return from Rachel's to find Green Gables a smoldering ruin.
00:02:34.445,00:02:36.322,-I will. -What?
00:02:36.406,00:02:39.242,"I mean, I won't. I-I-I mean, it won't."
00:02:39.325,00:02:40.952,"Don't worry, I'll go right in."
00:02:43.413,00:02:46.749,"Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home."
00:02:47.333,00:02:50.169,"Your house is on fire, and your children are home."
00:02:50.879,00:02:53.590,-Anne! -I'm going!
00:03:01.097,00:03:07.395,"All except one and that's little Ann, for she crept under the frying pan."
00:03:16.571,00:03:19.824,"Well, since you've asked for my advice, Marilla..."
00:03:20.909,00:03:23.202,I would humor her a little while longer.
00:03:23.286,00:03:25.955,You really think it's better she continue to stay at home?
00:03:26.039,00:03:31.044,"Yes. That is, I wouldn't say school again till she's said it herself."
00:03:31.127,00:03:32.587,And she will.
00:03:32.670,00:03:34.422,She won't be underfoot forever.
00:03:34.505,00:03:36.174,Truth is I'm torn.
00:03:38.092,00:03:44.015,"Bright as she is, she had such a difficult start in life, she isn't always... well, equipped for certain things."
00:03:45.058,00:03:48.519,More's the pity. She had such a longing for school.
00:03:48.603,00:03:50.605,"Bide your time, I'm telling you."
00:03:50.688,00:03:53.399,Anne is a clever one and all.
00:03:53.483,00:03:55.109,Too clever by half.
00:03:55.193,00:03:57.695,"She'll go back, that's for sure and certain."
00:03:57.779,00:04:00.657,It's hard to have lofty ideas when you're stuck in the kitchen all day.
00:04:03.868,00:04:05.703,She'll soon cool off in a week or so.
00:04:06.329,00:04:07.664,Or so?
00:04:07.747,00:04:09.082,Patience.
00:04:09.165,00:04:12.377,"Mark my words. Soon enough, she'll go back of her own accord."
00:04:14.128,00:04:15.380,God willing.
00:04:24.889,00:04:27.392,"I think this length is fetching, Griselda."
00:04:27.475,00:04:28.351,Yes.
00:04:29.686,00:04:31.938,"Yes, this will do nicely for dancing."
00:04:33.189,00:04:36.818,"Perhaps you can fashion a small loop at the hem, so I can lift the train."
00:04:38.987,00:04:42.532,"I do so appreciate all your careful attentions, Griselda."
00:04:42.615,00:04:45.910,I think it's ever so important to give credit where credit is due.
00:04:46.911,00:04:51.582,How awful it would be to be in service of those who neglect you or treat you unkindly.
00:04:53.501,00:04:56.879,I can imagine that it would make you feel quite small and hopeless.
00:04:58.089,00:05:00.883,And occasionally despairing and lacking in confidence.
00:05:03.177,00:05:05.305,I wonder if those feelings ever go away.
00:05:07.181,00:05:09.183,"I'll take tea in the library, Griselda."
00:05:09.851,00:05:15.106,"Today, I'm going to climb the ladder to reach the loneliest book on the highest shelf."
00:05:16.441,00:05:18.568,"Oh, dear God! Anne!"
00:05:18.651,00:05:20.737,"Marilla? Oh, the pie!"
00:05:22.405,00:05:24.782,"-Out of the way! -I'm sorry! Marilla, I'm so sorry!"
00:05:24.866,00:05:26.617,-I forgot! -I am aware!
00:05:26.701,00:05:29.829,Don't just stand there with your teeth in your head! Open the door!
00:05:35.960,00:05:37.962,Fetch the slop bucket.
00:05:40.506,00:05:42.175,"I'm very sorry, Marilla."
00:05:43.593,00:05:48.473,"I meant to watch the clock, truly I did. I was having the most delightful daydream."
00:05:48.556,00:05:50.016,"Your mind is idle, Anne!"
00:05:50.099,00:05:51.559,It isn't idle at all.
00:05:51.642,00:05:56.522,"I was imagining that I'm wise Princess Cordelia, and I only have to touch a book to know its contents."
00:05:56.606,00:05:58.024,This has gone on long enough.
00:05:58.608,00:06:02.612,"No one thinks she's strange. In fact, she's embraced for being different."
00:06:02.695,00:06:05.656,"-Life is not magic, Anne. -I know."
00:06:05.740,00:06:08.076,You can't just wish yourself away!
00:06:08.159,00:06:11.871,"I'm raising you, and I know what's best. It's high time you went back to school."
00:06:12.455,00:06:15.374,"Please don't make me, Marilla. Please! I can't face that."
00:06:15.458,00:06:22.006,"-I promise I'll do better here. I promise. -You can stop your bargaining, -'cause there's no use in it. -Matthew said I didn't have to go back!"
00:06:22.590,00:06:23.674,What now?
00:06:23.758,00:06:25.802,He understands that school is a torment for me.
00:06:25.885,00:06:28.221,But of course he'd understand. He's a kindred spirit!
00:06:28.304,00:06:30.056,I don't have any friends!
00:06:30.139,00:06:31.766,-You've got Diana. -No!
00:06:31.849,00:06:35.019,She can't like me when no one else does. Don't you see?
00:06:35.103,00:06:37.105,-Calm yourself! -And Gil...
00:06:37.188,00:06:40.775,"Well, there's a boy whose sole purpose in life is to humiliate me."
00:07:20.314,00:07:23.901,"Matthew Cuthbert, the time has come to end this foolishness."
00:07:27.321,00:07:29.157,I was only sympathizing.
00:07:29.240,00:07:31.993,Did we or did we not agree that her raising is up to me?
00:07:32.076,00:07:37.498,"I-I didn't mean to put my oar in. I hate it when she's upset, is all."
00:07:37.582,00:07:42.587,"Well, I hope you're happy, 'cause she's inside right now waltzing around a smoldering kitchen!"
00:07:43.754,00:07:46.215,She does seem to be a bit at sixes and sevens.
00:07:46.299,00:07:47.175,A bit?
00:07:47.258,00:07:49.427,She almost burnt down our home!
00:07:59.020,00:08:00.313,We have each other.
00:08:01.022,00:08:02.398,Katie?
00:08:03.024,00:08:04.567,"Katie, is that you?"
00:08:12.283,00:08:13.743,Katie Maurice?
00:08:21.167,00:08:22.668,"Please, Katie."
00:08:23.961,00:08:25.171,Please.
00:08:28.049,00:08:31.469,I'm sorry I had to leave you at Mrs. Hammond's.
00:08:33.804,00:08:38.518,You have no idea how grateful I'd be if you'd visit me here.
00:08:43.356,00:08:44.649,Katie?
00:08:49.862,00:08:56.202,"So, if it's all right with you, even though you know best, I would like to suggest that she return to school tomorrow!"
00:09:59.348,00:10:01.183,What brings you inside this time of day?
00:10:02.810,00:10:04.520,"What is it you need, Matthew?"
00:10:04.604,00:10:05.896,I...
00:10:07.398,00:10:08.441,I'll take a coffee.
00:10:08.524,00:10:10.067,At three in the afternoon?
00:10:11.110,00:10:12.153,Or-Or tea.
00:10:12.653,00:10:15.197,"Tea will be ready at four, just like every other day."
00:10:16.115,00:10:16.949,"Right, then."
00:10:22.747,00:10:26.626,She'll get used to school soon enough. Same as all the other children.
00:10:26.709,00:10:27.793,But...
00:10:28.419,00:10:29.754,But what?
00:10:29.837,00:10:31.756,Anne's not like the others.
00:10:32.340,00:10:34.216,"You're too soft with her, Matthew."
00:10:35.217,00:10:38.971,We'll not ask her too many questions when she gets back. Can we agree on that?
00:10:39.055,00:10:42.266,"I don't want to open a can of worms. She'll learn to like it, and that's that."
00:10:43.726,00:10:44.894,Anne.
00:10:49.148,00:10:51.317,I'm sure you're wondering how the school day went.
00:10:52.068,00:10:54.403,I'm pleased to report it wasn't as bad as I thought.
00:10:57.365,00:10:58.824,"Well, that's just fine."
00:11:00.326,00:11:02.745,Do you not have homework? Where are your books?
00:11:02.828,00:11:04.747,"Oh, I didn't need to bring them home today."
00:11:05.956,00:11:07.667,I'll go put this down on the bench.
00:11:12.671,00:11:13.714,"Hello, Katie."
00:11:14.340,00:11:16.384,I brought you your favorite flower.
00:11:18.219,00:11:19.762,It's a wild rose.
00:11:23.349,00:11:25.810,"Katie, I wish you were here."
00:12:00.261,00:12:02.179,"Well, my bed's all made."
00:12:02.263,00:12:05.599,"May I take an extra apple, Marilla, in case I have a friend to share it with?"
00:12:05.683,00:12:06.976,Help yourself.
00:12:08.936,00:12:11.605,Isn't it wonderful that every day can be an adventure?
00:12:11.689,00:12:15.192,-You're chipper this morning. -It all depends on how you look at things.
00:12:29.081,00:12:33.669,I'm expecting to learn about the District of Saskatchewan today.
00:12:34.879,00:12:37.882,Isn't Saskatchewan just the most delicious name to say?
00:12:41.552,00:12:43.220,I'd like to go there someday.
00:12:44.722,00:12:47.308,It's exciting to learn about all the places one might go.
00:12:47.391,00:12:49.351,I think the Prairies hold a lot of appeal.
00:12:50.352,00:12:53.022,"Well, time to go. Goodbye, Marilla."
00:12:53.105,00:12:56.525,I hope you don't envy me too much in this time of great learning in my young life.
00:13:12.541,00:13:14.251,Anne stays so late in school.
00:13:14.335,00:13:15.628,She enjoys it now?
00:13:16.253,00:13:17.505,It seems she does.
00:13:19.423,00:13:20.466,Thank you.
00:13:39.360,00:13:40.361,"Hello, ladies."
00:13:40.945,00:13:42.071,Hello.
00:13:57.336,00:13:58.796,"Good afternoon, Diana."
00:13:58.879,00:14:00.506,This is Miss Ruby Gillis.
00:14:00.589,00:14:02.508,-Hello. -Hello.
00:14:02.591,00:14:04.176,What brings you both by?
00:14:04.260,00:14:07.179,We thought Anne might like to have her books and everything.
00:14:07.263,00:14:10.474,"-Nice to meet you. Come on, Diana. -We've been worrying about her."
00:14:11.141,00:14:12.476,"Isn't that right, Ruby?"
00:14:14.228,00:14:15.521,Diana especially.
00:14:17.690,00:14:19.149,Did something happen?
00:14:21.819,00:14:23.696,Anne is too sensitive for this world.
00:14:24.196,00:14:26.115,"That's what she told me once, anyway."
00:14:26.699,00:14:28.534,Is she truly never coming back to school?
00:14:30.202,00:14:32.288,"If she's not, then we can sit together, Diana."
00:14:36.041,00:14:37.418,When did you last see her?
00:14:38.002,00:14:39.461,It's been days and days.
00:14:39.545,00:14:41.589,I never imagined she wouldn't come back.
00:14:42.464,00:14:43.841,Neither did I.
00:14:44.300,00:14:45.926,May we say hello to her?
00:14:46.468,00:14:50.723,"Anne is running an errand at present, but I'll be sure to tell her you were here."
00:14:51.307,00:14:54.685,"Please do, Miss Cuthbert. Please tell Anne we miss her very much."
00:14:55.561,00:14:56.812,You can count on it.
00:15:07.489,00:15:19.043,"Their word was 'kisiskatchewan' meaning the 'river that flows swiftly,' in reference to the most important waterways running through their territory, the North and South Saskatchewan rivers."
00:15:19.126,00:15:23.172,"I love the way that native names always mean something specific, don't you?"
00:15:23.255,00:15:25.925,I wonder what my name would be if I was a North American native.
00:15:27.468,00:15:29.386,Fire-haired Dreamer?
00:15:30.429,00:15:31.388,Or maybe...
00:15:32.431,00:15:34.808,She Who Speaks With Trees?
00:15:36.352,00:15:37.478,Or...
00:15:38.646,00:15:39.855,I know.
00:15:40.648,00:15:43.400,Kindred Spirit. That could work.
00:15:45.861,00:15:47.446,"What's that, dear Griselda?"
00:15:49.448,00:15:51.909,"Yes. You're right, as usual."
00:16:00.751,00:16:03.837,"I'll see you in the bright and shiny morning, dear students."
00:16:12.554,00:16:15.557,Sorry I'm late. There was just so much to learn.
00:16:15.641,00:16:17.810,How was the District of Saskatchewan?
00:16:17.893,00:16:20.604,"Oh, fascinating. I had another excellent day."
00:16:20.688,00:16:24.316,"I learned so much, and I imagine Mr. Phillips was quite impressed, and..."
00:17:04.023,00:17:05.524,And then lied some more.
00:17:06.108,00:17:07.484,Right to our faces.
00:17:08.569,00:17:15.868,"I've been doing my best to teach her right from wrong, but, well, this matter is so grave that we knew we had to bring it to you."
00:17:15.951,00:17:17.578,"Indeed, indeed."
00:17:17.661,00:17:19.038,You did right.
00:17:19.955,00:17:21.874,It's a very good thing I'm here.
00:17:24.334,00:17:26.962,"God frowns on fibbing, young lady."
00:17:27.046,00:17:28.213,I imagine He does.
00:17:29.131,00:17:31.717,I see now how truly wrong I was.
00:17:31.800,00:17:34.178,Wrong and disrespectful.
00:17:34.261,00:17:37.639,"-I assure you, Minister, I am full of woe. -Yes."
00:17:37.723,00:17:40.350,And also dismay. With a good measure of chagrin.
00:17:41.351,00:17:46.023,I can only hope that it pleases God to know how truly unhappy I am.
00:17:46.732,00:17:48.901,-Does it? -That is something you must pray on.
00:17:49.777,00:17:54.031,"Now, Anne, you must always remember, honesty is the best policy."
00:17:55.240,00:17:57.743,"Honesty isn't actually a policy, though, is it?"
00:17:57.826,00:17:59.078,I beg your pardon?
00:17:59.161,00:18:03.499,"-Anne! -Well, I believe that-- I see now what you're up against."
00:18:03.582,00:18:05.250,It doesn't matter what you think.
00:18:05.334,00:18:07.127,About anything?
00:18:07.211,00:18:10.297,-Or--? -Do you agree never to lie again?
00:18:11.465,00:18:15.552,-Is a lie of omission really a lie? -You see? She's not sorry!
00:18:15.636,00:18:22.392,"I am sorry, Marilla. I truly am sorry for vexing you, and for-- -You said you were going to school. -I went, in a fashion."
00:18:24.603,00:18:28.524,Enough! You must learn to harness yourself.
00:18:28.607,00:18:32.027,"I see what the problem is here. Oh, yes, I do, indeed."
00:18:32.611,00:18:34.530,And I have divined an answer.
00:18:34.613,00:18:37.199,This problem is easily solved.
00:18:38.450,00:18:40.994,"If the girl doesn't want to go to school, then she shouldn't go."
00:18:42.162,00:18:47.668,"She should stay home, and learn proper housekeeping until she marries."
00:18:51.713,00:18:56.343,And then the Lord God said: It is not good that the man should be alone.
00:18:56.426,00:18:59.179,I will make him a helper fit for him.
00:19:01.473,00:19:04.643,There's no need for her to bother with an education.
00:19:04.726,00:19:08.647,Every young woman should learn how to be a good wife.
00:19:13.527,00:19:17.281,"I don't know quite what I expected the minister to say, but I assure you it wasn't that."
00:19:17.364,00:19:21.034,"I fear preparing myself to be a wife will be a powerful challenge for you, Marilla."
00:19:26.081,00:19:29.835,"Admittedly, I'm very homely and clumsy."
00:19:31.086,00:19:34.464,It'll be a big surprise to both of us if I marry someday. I never expected to.
00:19:34.548,00:19:39.511,But if God decrees it-- Will you please go in the barn and see if anything needs doing?
00:19:39.595,00:19:41.597,I need to hear myself think.
00:19:46.602,00:19:48.937,Marilla wants me to find some outdoor chores to do.
00:19:49.646,00:19:53.150,Jerry's in the loft. He'll tell you what needs doing.
00:20:01.575,00:20:03.285,"You're so lucky to be a boy, Jerry."
00:20:04.119,00:20:05.621,Boys can do anything they want.
00:20:06.830,00:20:08.832,And boys have every opportunity.
00:20:08.916,00:20:10.667,You can go to school if you want.
00:20:10.751,00:20:13.420,Wait. Does that mean school's out of the question for you?
00:20:13.503,00:20:16.798,-Where do you think I'd rather be? -I hadn't really thought about it.
00:20:17.382,00:20:19.676,There's so many things I hadn't thought of before today.
00:20:19.760,00:20:21.637,I don't see how I'm ever gonna be a good wife.
00:20:21.720,00:20:24.264,-Probably not. -I have such a bad temper.
00:20:24.348,00:20:25.766,-True. -And I'm wicked.
00:20:25.849,00:20:29.561,"And impatient and skinny and homely. Don't say anything, Jerry."
00:20:32.564,00:20:35.067,I never thought that a wife is what I would be.
00:21:15.774,00:21:18.485,There have to be other options. What do you want to be?
00:21:19.945,00:21:20.946,I do this.
00:21:21.530,00:21:23.824,"But what if, what if I was a published author?"
00:21:23.907,00:21:26.827,"What if I were in command of an army, like Joan of Arc?"
00:21:29.830,00:21:31.873,I don't need school for any of those things.
00:21:31.957,00:21:33.542,Why aren't you answering my question?
00:21:36.753,00:21:40.132,My brother's apprentice as a blacksmith. The other learns to become a butcher.
00:21:41.758,00:21:43.552,"I could be a smithy, I suppose."
00:21:43.635,00:21:45.679,"But what do you want, Jerry?"
00:21:45.762,00:21:48.807,You could be a cartographer or an aviator.
00:21:48.890,00:21:50.934,You could even lead a safari.
00:21:51.018,00:21:55.272,"-I don't know what you're talking about. -Come on, Jerry! Use your imagination!"
00:21:55.355,00:21:57.649,"No, seriously, I don't know any of those words."
00:21:58.233,00:21:59.401,Oh.
00:21:59.985,00:22:01.153,"Well, you get the idea."
00:22:01.236,00:22:06.575,"And I'm not sure about you, but suddenly I feel absolutely ablaze with possibility!"
00:22:07.159,00:22:09.661,"Or you could just go to school, because you can."
00:22:11.621,00:22:13.123,Go find something else to do.
00:22:30.390,00:22:31.641,Marilla?
00:22:36.605,00:22:37.898,What are you doing?
00:22:42.152,00:22:43.904,You know the stove's gone cold?
00:22:47.115,00:22:48.241,"My, my."
00:22:49.326,00:22:50.744,This is unlike you.
00:22:53.622,00:22:56.083,I have no idea what's like me.
00:22:57.417,00:22:58.835,None at all.
00:23:02.297,00:23:03.715,I'll light the stove.
00:23:17.771,00:23:21.274,"I... I suppose your mind is burdened, then."
00:23:22.192,00:23:23.819,By the minister's visit.
00:23:23.902,00:23:27.823,"Oh, everything is just peaches and cream, thank you for asking."
00:23:29.241,00:23:34.329,"Now, is there anything I can bake or clean or mend or fetch for you?"
00:24:12.450,00:24:14.035,Marilla!
00:24:14.119,00:24:15.328,Marilla!
00:24:15.829,00:24:16.955,What's happening?
00:24:17.831,00:24:21.126,There's a fire in town. Put on your boots and hurry down.
00:24:30.260,00:24:31.887,Fetch the cellar buckets.
00:24:31.970,00:24:33.513,We'll slop the pigs on our way.
00:24:35.515,00:24:36.850,"Quick, like a bunny!"
00:24:40.145,00:24:41.188,"Quick, quick!"
00:24:42.189,00:24:43.815,Fetch every bucket you can find.
00:24:47.319,00:24:49.154,Hold them still with blankets.
00:24:51.489,00:24:52.782,Bring the lantern.
00:25:09.925,00:25:11.635,"Oh, poor Ruby."
00:25:35.575,00:25:36.826,Anne!
00:25:46.878,00:25:48.505,Hurry up! Hurry up!
00:25:49.965,00:25:51.883,Get some buckets for Gilbert!
00:25:56.054,00:25:57.555,"All right! Let's go, let's go!"
00:26:00.475,00:26:02.811,It's burning so fierce. Is everyone out?
00:26:03.478,00:26:06.231,"Uh, yeah. That's the Gillis family over there. You see Ruby?"
00:26:08.483,00:26:10.735,Why are the doors and windows open?
00:26:23.540,00:26:24.624,Anne?
00:26:27.502,00:26:29.504,No! Anne!
00:26:30.088,00:26:31.256,Anne!
00:26:33.258,00:26:34.759,Anne! Anne!
00:26:35.802,00:26:37.095,Anne!
00:26:58.074,00:26:59.326,Anne!
00:27:05.081,00:27:07.208,What's happened to Anne? Anne!
00:27:08.668,00:27:11.004,-Let me go! I need to get Anne! -No!
00:27:15.091,00:27:16.968,-Anne! -No!
00:27:17.052,00:27:20.055,"-No, let me go! I need to get Anne! -No! Marilla! Stay here!"
00:27:21.264,00:27:22.557,"Oh, my God!"
00:27:22.640,00:27:25.769,"All right, it's slowing down! We can do this! Keep 'em coming!"
00:27:36.404,00:27:37.572,Where is she?
00:27:37.655,00:27:40.075,I don't understand. Where is she?
00:27:58.176,00:28:00.512,"Mr. Cuthbert! Mr. Cuthbert, help!"
00:28:03.181,00:28:06.559,Shaft's given way. Lift it off. Other end. Just lift.
00:28:11.022,00:28:12.732,"Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick."
00:28:15.026,00:28:18.029,"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven."
00:28:18.113,00:28:24.202,"Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, -as we forgive those who trespass... -Anne!"
00:28:24.285,00:28:26.955,"Anne! Anne! Oh, Anne!"
00:28:30.333,00:28:31.626,Find out what's happened.
00:28:39.008,00:28:39.884,She's all right.
00:28:40.927,00:28:43.012,What were you thinking?
00:28:43.096,00:28:45.014,-Did it help? -Why ever did you run inside?
00:28:46.433,00:28:49.185,-Did it slow it down? -What were you thinking?
00:28:49.853,00:28:54.274,Fire... fire needs oxygen. Closing windows and doors deprives it.
00:28:54.357,00:28:56.735,"Oh, my word!"
00:28:58.361,00:28:59.821,However do you know that?
00:28:59.904,00:29:01.614,It was Anne! She did it!
00:29:05.118,00:29:08.955,The fire manual in the orphanage. There wasn't much else to read.
00:29:21.885,00:29:25.513,"And we thank Thee, O Lord, for your mercy."
00:29:26.306,00:29:29.684,"And of some have compassion, making a difference."
00:29:29.768,00:29:36.733,"Others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh."
00:29:36.816,00:29:44.657,Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy...
00:29:44.741,00:29:46.117,Maybe you could be a firefighter.
00:29:53.625,00:29:56.294,Praise be to God Almighty.
00:29:57.921,00:29:59.839,"All right, it's settled."
00:30:00.715,00:30:06.679,"The Gillis family will be billeted out to the Barrys, the Cuthberts and ourselves."
00:30:07.972,00:30:12.185,"All the men pulling together, we figure the major repairs will take about a week."
00:30:12.268,00:30:13.561,Sounds about right.
00:30:13.645,00:30:18.191,Jerry and I will put things right at Green Gables and be back as soon as we can.
00:30:18.274,00:30:21.569,As will I. I'll bring as many hands as I can spare.
00:30:22.403,00:30:23.488,Thank you.
00:30:24.697,00:30:25.949,What a thing.
00:30:26.991,00:30:30.453,-What a thing. -We'll get it squared away. Never fear.
00:30:30.537,00:30:33.289,We owe you all a great debt of thanks.
00:30:33.373,00:30:35.333,Especially dear Anne.
00:30:35.416,00:30:38.211,"Risking your life for us, and taking such quick action."
00:30:39.003,00:30:42.674,"And, ladies, thank you kindly for agreeing to take the children."
00:30:42.757,00:30:46.511,Especially since school won't be in session. You'll have your hands full.
00:30:47.345,00:30:49.597,"Ruby? Come here, please."
00:30:49.681,00:30:52.058,It's no trouble at all. We're happy to have her.
00:30:52.600,00:30:55.687,"Now, Anne and Ruby can get to know each other better."
00:30:55.770,00:30:59.023,What? No. Mother!
00:30:59.107,00:31:00.942,-Ruby... -I don't want to stay there.
00:31:02.986,00:31:06.406,-Why can't I stay with Diana? -That's enough! The plan is set.
00:31:06.489,00:31:08.700,I'll never live it down! Please don't make me!
00:31:10.660,00:31:13.788,After this evening you should be grateful to have a bed to sleep in at all.
00:31:13.872,00:31:15.248,"Hear, hear."
00:31:20.169,00:31:22.797,"It doesn't matter what the other girls think, Ruby."
00:31:23.381,00:31:24.757,It matters what you think.
00:31:26.175,00:31:29.554,"And I, for one, think Anne is marvelous and brave."
00:31:33.224,00:31:34.976,"I'll visit soon, all right?"
00:31:39.439,00:31:41.649,It's all right. Don't worry.
00:31:41.733,00:31:43.818,I'm sure no one will think you're my friend.
00:31:45.820,00:31:47.363,I reckon we should be off.
00:32:01.127,00:32:04.797,"Now, I'd like the two of you to go upstairs to bed for a few hours."
00:32:04.881,00:32:06.883,You both need rest after that terrible night.
00:32:06.966,00:32:08.593,"I can help you, Marilla."
00:32:08.676,00:32:09.928,I should fetch the eggs.
00:32:10.011,00:32:11.888,"You can, but you won't."
00:32:12.805,00:32:14.307,"Now, up to bed with both of you."
00:32:14.974,00:32:18.561,"Anne, please see to it that your guest is comfortable."
00:32:18.645,00:32:20.229,"Come along, Ruby."
00:32:20.313,00:32:24.025,"I have a lovely gable room, and the cherry tree is ever so friendly."
00:32:35.036,00:32:38.206,"My first night here in this room, I cried as you do now."
00:32:39.832,00:32:43.461,"Try as I might, there was no hope for my imagination that cold night."
00:32:45.004,00:32:47.423,Princess Cordelia was nowhere to be found.
00:32:48.007,00:32:49.717,Princess Cordelia?
00:32:51.094,00:32:51.928,Well...
00:32:52.929,00:32:55.306,she's a wise and solitary princess.
00:32:55.390,00:33:03.022,"She wears dresses of the finest silk, and velvet with puff sleeves and ever so many flounces."
00:33:05.149,00:33:06.359,One day...
00:33:07.235,00:33:12.031,Princess Cordelia arrived at the most beautiful kingdom in the world.
00:33:13.574,00:33:16.995,"She knew not a soul, and was worried no one would like her."
00:33:17.078,00:33:19.539,All my dresses will be ruined from the smoke!
00:33:21.040,00:33:24.168,You can borrow one of mine. I have two.
00:33:28.965,00:33:33.302,A week really isn't that long when you plan out all the things you want to do.
00:33:33.886,00:33:36.848,Maybe start by imagining what color you want your room to be.
00:33:37.390,00:33:40.601,I know for a fact that it's good to have things to look forward to.
00:33:45.481,00:33:46.774,What color do you like?
00:33:47.358,00:33:49.986,Pink would also be divine.
00:33:52.572,00:33:54.449,I never usually think of pink.
00:33:54.949,00:33:57.994,"Being as I'm so redheaded, it's out of the question."
00:33:58.077,00:34:00.747,But you would look so pretty in a pink room.
00:34:08.629,00:34:11.883,"We can make some biscuits for the boys, while they work."
00:34:12.717,00:34:14.302,You can see Gilbert.
00:34:15.219,00:34:19.223,Diana thought he cut quite a heroic figure putting out the blaze on your behalf.
00:34:19.891,00:34:21.225,On my behalf?
00:34:22.101,00:34:24.145,I hadn't really thought of it like that.
00:34:25.646,00:34:27.607,"Well, I didn't notice, of course."
00:34:27.690,00:34:29.817,I am not a Gilbert Blythe fan.
00:34:30.610,00:34:34.614,"I shall never forgive his insult, and I shall never be dissuaded from my low opinion of him."
00:34:35.281,00:34:37.533,That's a good idea about the biscuits.
00:34:39.285,00:34:41.370,It's a shame you're not in school anymore.
00:34:42.955,00:34:45.083,You seem awful smart about things.
00:34:46.459,00:34:48.503,It's best for everyone that I'm not there.
00:34:57.470,00:34:59.555,-I'll need a hand framing this up. -Here!
00:35:02.683,00:35:05.103,"Put your backs into it, boys!"
00:35:08.981,00:35:11.484,Here you go. How many would you like?
00:35:15.905,00:35:17.406,"Afternoon, Minister."
00:35:17.490,00:35:19.826,I'm learning to bake. Would you care for a scone?
00:35:23.704,00:35:26.499,"Oh, this is some heavy work."
00:35:28.709,00:35:30.920,"Hey, look, it's the freak and her new twin sister."
00:35:32.046,00:35:34.632,"As long as they bring food, I don't care if it's Quasimodo."
00:35:47.019,00:35:50.898,"Girls are so useless. Guess you should have stayed home in the kitchen, eh?"
00:35:51.649,00:35:53.276,What is wrong with you?
00:35:53.359,00:35:55.194,Go home and bake cookies!
00:35:56.070,00:35:57.864,Headline: they already did.
00:35:57.947,00:36:01.117,"This is Ruby's property, or did you forget?"
00:36:01.200,00:36:04.203,"Why don't you shove off, and leave the men to their work?"
00:36:04.287,00:36:09.500,"Why don't you give me that hammer and I'll finish the job myself, if you're too busy being a bully to get it done?"
00:36:11.544,00:36:12.837,"Hey, here."
00:36:13.713,00:36:15.047,You all right?
00:36:24.932,00:36:28.436,"Of course. Thanks for, um, coming by to help feed the beasts."
00:36:32.732,00:36:35.359,"Matthew, will you please bring the basket home later?"
00:36:43.242,00:36:45.244,"Come on, Ruby. Let's get you home."
00:36:50.041,00:36:53.711,"You're right, Minister. Honesty is the best policy."
00:36:53.794,00:36:55.630,And it's also very satisfying.
00:36:55.713,00:36:57.924,"Well, I-I-I-I..."
00:37:01.135,00:37:03.262,Gilbert is so chivalrous.
00:37:04.472,00:37:06.182,"Well, he's something, all right."
00:37:10.311,00:37:12.980,"That was, uh, quite the incident..."
00:37:13.856,00:37:16.859,"uh, up there at the Gillis house today."
00:37:16.943,00:37:18.986,Nothing beats a redhead for a temper.
00:37:19.820,00:37:20.821,Oh...
00:37:20.905,00:37:24.450,I meant you being as brave as you were.
00:37:25.993,00:37:27.078,Oh.
00:37:27.161,00:37:31.040,"If you were a boy, oh, that would have ended up in fisticuffs."
00:37:31.123,00:37:32.124,I wouldn't have minded.
00:37:32.208,00:37:35.378,Billy Andrews is a coward who deserves a sock in the kisser.
00:37:36.671,00:37:38.047,-I could take him. -Oh...
00:37:39.006,00:37:40.675,Not if you don't...
00:37:42.009,00:37:43.219,protect the nose.
00:37:43.302,00:37:45.304,"-Oh! -Oh, oh!"
00:37:45.388,00:37:48.140,You're pretty good! You've been taking lessons on the sly?
00:37:50.142,00:37:52.603,Just call me Avonlea Ace!
00:37:53.521,00:37:56.357,"-You're a natural. Nose, nose, nose! -Huh, huh!"
00:37:59.402,00:38:01.195,"-Huh! -Oh, gee!"
00:38:08.744,00:38:12.748,"Oh, Anne, this is so... so..."
00:38:12.832,00:38:14.834,Deliciously secret and scrumptiously exciting?
00:38:17.295,00:38:20.423,-I hardly know what you're saying. -Thank you.
00:38:20.506,00:38:25.344,"Now before we begin cultivating our imaginations, each of us should pick our nom de plume."
00:38:28.306,00:38:31.767,A nom de plume is a pen name for purposes of anonymity.
00:38:36.647,00:38:38.524,"Oh, that gives me such a thrill!"
00:38:39.317,00:38:44.113,"Once a week, we'll read our completed stories aloud to each other and talk them over thoughtfully."
00:38:53.080,00:38:54.373,I can't think of anything!
00:38:54.457,00:38:56.876,I've got heaps of ideas if you need a little prompting.
00:38:58.127,00:39:03.883,How about a tale of romance most divine and tragical?
00:39:17.021,00:39:19.440,I can't believe I move back into my house tomorrow.
00:39:21.525,00:39:23.027,And school will start again.
00:39:24.695,00:39:26.280,Everything will be made right.
00:39:30.242,00:39:31.535,"I'll miss you, Anne."
00:40:18.207,00:40:21.043,I thought you'd like to know that Ruby has gone to sleep.
00:40:23.170,00:40:24.505,"Well, thank you, Anne."
00:40:32.138,00:40:34.390,It's handy that she can fall asleep so easily.
00:40:34.473,00:40:38.644,"She needs her rest, seeing as how she's going home tomorrow, and school will start again soon."
00:40:38.727,00:40:40.020,Mm-hm.
00:40:48.195,00:40:49.738,I'm in a quandary.
00:40:58.622,00:41:00.833,It worries me what the minister said.
00:41:00.916,00:41:03.961,Not the not fibbing part. He was right about that.
00:41:05.421,00:41:07.923,It's the not going to school and being a wife part.
00:41:10.843,00:41:12.928,"I've been pondering about that, too."
00:41:14.388,00:41:17.433,His thinking seems a mite old-fashioned to me.
00:41:21.770,00:41:22.855,What do you think?
00:41:24.648,00:41:28.861,"Well, it doesn't provide much scope for the imagination, that's for sure and certain."
00:41:30.237,00:41:33.449,"You know, it seems to me you should decide for yourself..."
00:41:34.200,00:41:39.580,what you want to do and be and set your mind to it.
00:41:42.791,00:41:46.837,"Maybe school wouldn't be so bad, now that I have Diana and Ruby."
00:41:48.130,00:41:50.633,"You've got a good and nimble mind, Anne."
00:41:51.842,00:41:53.886,I don't see why you should limit it.
00:41:57.765,00:42:00.768,"In my day, we didn't get to choose."
00:42:02.561,00:42:04.980,I think you should make your own decision.
00:42:28.587,00:42:30.005,"Goodbye, dear Katie."
00:42:49.525,00:42:50.943,Don't make me ask you again.
00:42:54.405,00:42:56.699,Open your readers to chapter 12.
00:43:11.213,00:43:15.718,"When I turn around, you best have your readers open."
00:43:18.846,00:43:20.222,She's here!
00:43:20.806,00:43:21.974,Anne!
00:43:24.560,00:43:25.894,I've missed you so much!
00:00:13.596,00:00:14.889,Amorous.
00:00:15.598,00:00:25.900,A-M-O-R... U-- Spell gorgeous.
00:00:25.984,00:00:33.533,"G-O-R-G-I-- Ugh! Sit down, you butcher of beauty."
00:00:36.119,00:00:36.953,Ostracize?
00:00:38.246,00:00:43.251,O-S-T-R-A-C-I-Z-E.
00:00:48.465,00:00:49.299,Haughty.
00:00:49.382,00:00:51.926,H-A-U-G-H-T-Y.
00:00:52.010,00:00:53.178,Callous.
00:00:53.261,00:00:55.972,C-A-L-L-O-U-S.
00:00:58.975,00:01:00.185,Penitent.
00:01:00.268,00:01:05.440,P-E-N-I-T-E-N-T.
00:01:10.487,00:01:11.362,Intentions.
00:01:11.446,00:01:17.077,I-N-T-E-N-T-I-O-N-S.
00:01:21.831,00:01:22.832,Persevere.
00:01:23.374,00:01:28.296,P-E-R-S-E-V-E-R-E.
00:01:32.717,00:01:33.551,Engagement.
00:01:34.469,00:01:39.933,E-N-G-A-G-M...
00:01:41.100,00:01:44.604,"That is incorrect. The... spelling, not the sentiment."
00:01:48.024,00:01:49.025,"Anne, you won!"
00:01:52.195,00:01:55.240,"Congratulations, Anne. I should have added the E."
00:02:01.454,00:02:03.540,"Anne, are you feeling all right?"
00:03:26.539,00:03:29.083,I'm sorry! I'm so sorry I disturbed you.
00:03:29.167,00:03:32.003,I'm so very sorry you bet on the wrong horse.
00:03:32.086,00:03:33.880,Whatever do you mean?
00:03:37.050,00:03:38.551,What are you doing there?
00:03:38.635,00:03:44.265,"If you want to send me to the hospital for the remainder of my days, I will completely understand!"
00:03:46.351,00:03:49.437,Will you please plant some pink roses on my grave?
00:03:49.520,00:03:51.940,"Anne, you are not dying!"
00:03:53.358,00:03:58.821,"You're in your womanly flowering time, and it's perfectly normal."
00:03:58.905,00:04:01.282,But I'm not ready to be a woman!
00:04:01.366,00:04:03.826,"Well, it's God's plan, and that's the way of it."
00:04:06.120,00:04:10.083,There is no way God would think it's time for me to be a woman!
00:04:12.335,00:04:15.088,You'll need some cotton cloths to pin to your undergarments.
00:04:15.171,00:04:16.798,"Oh, this can't be happening."
00:04:16.881,00:04:20.927,"And after, they'll need to be washed in cold water first and then hot."
00:04:24.472,00:04:26.099,I did. For many years.
00:04:26.182,00:04:27.225,Years?
00:04:27.892,00:04:29.727,Your cycle is a few days every month.
00:04:29.811,00:04:32.647,Every month? But why? Why is this happening now?
00:04:32.730,00:04:35.149,"-Everything was fine for once! -Matthew, out!"
00:04:35.233,00:04:36.693,"Anne, what's wrong?"
00:04:40.196,00:04:43.366,"I, uh... Yes. Um..."
00:04:43.992,00:04:44.993,Barn.
00:04:51.165,00:04:52.792,"My word, you're hysterical."
00:04:53.376,00:04:55.003,I hate this.
00:05:11.769,00:05:14.272,-Perhaps stay home from school today. -What?
00:05:14.355,00:05:16.858,"No. No, no, no. I-I can't lose time, Marilla."
00:05:16.941,00:05:20.194,-There's no reason-- -I need to keep up my academic record!
00:05:20.278,00:05:23.573,I have just caught up with Gil... with the rest of the class!
00:05:24.324,00:05:25.992,"Whatever you want, Anne."
00:05:26.451,00:05:27.952,Whatever you want.
00:06:07.575,00:06:09.660,Mrs. Kincannon will be here shortly.
00:06:18.211,00:06:21.881,"-And I'll be home straight after school. -All right. Thank you, son."
00:06:40.399,00:06:43.903,"-Well, good morning, Mrs. Kincannon. -Gilbert, you're late for school."
00:06:43.986,00:06:47.698,-I promise I'll get your wages next week. -No worries. I know where you live.
00:06:59.585,00:07:01.963,"Oh, it was like something out of Shakespeare."
00:07:02.630,00:07:05.633,"-Yet she insisted on going to school? -Mercifully, yes."
00:07:06.259,00:07:08.886,But poor Matthew had fled the house well before then.
00:07:09.929,00:07:11.556,You may not see him for a week.
00:07:11.639,00:07:16.227,"If you see a suspicious character foraging in your garden, please feed him some supper."
00:07:19.689,00:07:20.857,"Oh, God."
00:07:21.774,00:07:23.151,I don't miss it.
00:07:23.234,00:07:26.320,I'll say it out loud: I'd rather be pregnant than menstruating.
00:07:27.905,00:07:29.282,That explains all the children.
00:07:42.003,00:07:45.089,"I got mine three months ago, and I feel extremely mature."
00:07:45.840,00:07:47.758,-You seem mature. -You do.
00:07:48.426,00:07:50.803,"I think the boys take me more seriously, too."
00:07:51.220,00:07:54.640,But they can't tell. Can they tell? That would be awful.
00:07:57.143,00:08:01.147,"but I'm not a little girl anymore, and I believe that's noticeable."
00:08:01.564,00:08:02.648,My bosoms are growing.
00:08:03.858,00:08:06.068,Yet another reason why this is inexplicable.
00:08:06.819,00:08:08.905,"-I got mine last year. -Me, too."
00:08:08.988,00:08:10.364,Really?
00:08:10.448,00:08:14.160,My father has started opening the door for me. It's sweet.
00:08:19.582,00:08:23.127,"-Ruby, what's wrong? -I'm not a woman. Why don't I have it?"
00:08:23.211,00:08:27.548,"Trust me, if I could give you mine, I would. This is so inconvenient!"
00:08:27.632,00:08:29.258,"-Hush, Anne! -Keep your voice down!"
00:08:29.342,00:08:31.010,No one's supposed to know.
00:08:31.093,00:08:33.262,A woman's cycle is a shameful thing.
00:08:35.014,00:08:37.475,"It's unmentionable, that's why."
00:08:37.558,00:08:40.937,-That's not a reason. -Why don't you ever understand anything?
00:08:41.687,00:08:44.941,"Marilla says it's God's plan, so doesn't that make it good?"
00:08:45.024,00:08:50.363,"I mean, we can make a whole person. Where's the shame in that?"
00:08:50.446,00:08:53.115,Am I the only one who thinks she's out of her mind?
00:08:53.199,00:08:56.160,"It's a secret, Anne. That's just the way it is."
00:08:56.244,00:08:58.871,Do boys have to contend with anything like this?
00:09:02.750,00:09:04.377,Why are they doing that?
00:09:11.884,00:09:13.928,There's a question for the ages.
00:09:16.973,00:09:21.269,"When I get mine, I stay home from school, because I don't want to have an accident."
00:09:21.352,00:09:22.562,Accident?
00:09:23.521,00:09:27.400,There was a girl a few years ago who bled through right the back of her dress.
00:09:27.483,00:09:30.027,"Oh, I would die of mortification."
00:09:30.987,00:09:34.824,"The teacher called her up to the blackboard, and everybody saw."
00:09:40.788,00:09:44.375,Which districts comprise the Prairies? Gilbert?
00:09:44.959,00:09:46.002,Um...
00:09:46.836,00:09:53.009,"The districts of Athabasca, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Assiniboia."
00:09:57.597,00:10:02.059,"Anne, which provinces comprise the Atlantic Maritimes?"
00:10:21.454,00:10:22.663,I'm sorry. I just...
00:10:29.003,00:10:30.671,Sometime today.
00:10:35.301,00:10:37.720,Worst day ever!
00:10:38.846,00:10:42.016,Nice boys never say people eat insects.
00:10:42.600,00:10:45.686,-I beg your pardon? -It's a mnemonic device.
00:10:45.770,00:10:49.649,"It helps you remember things, right? That's, uh, the Maritimes."
00:10:49.732,00:10:56.781,"New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, PEI. Nice boys-- Diana, could you please tell Gilbert Blythe that I don't need his help?"
00:10:57.823,00:10:59.909,Why don't you just tell me yourself? I'm right here.
00:11:00.660,00:11:02.119,I suppose I just did.
00:11:03.329,00:11:04.830,Mnemonics is spelled with M.
00:11:06.374,00:11:08.542,Not that you need my help or anything.
00:11:12.254,00:11:13.506,You too.
00:11:17.635,00:11:18.469,Sorry.
00:11:35.319,00:11:37.113,"Afternoon, Anne."
00:11:37.196,00:11:39.657,"Yes, I'm aware that it's the afternoon."
00:11:39.740,00:11:40.741,I beg your pardon?
00:11:40.825,00:11:42.410,Why doesn't anyone say what they mean?
00:11:42.493,00:11:45.079,"How about, Hello. Still having the world's lousiest day?"
00:11:45.162,00:11:47.081,"Why, yes, thank you, I am!"
00:11:47.164,00:11:48.958,I'll thank you to mind your manners.
00:11:49.041,00:11:51.544,What does that even mean?
00:11:53.796,00:11:55.798,Did you talk things over with Diana?
00:11:55.881,00:12:00.511,"Well, I talk to Diana every day, so obviously I did!"
00:12:00.594,00:12:01.887,Ugh!
00:12:21.282,00:12:23.409,I don't feel very well.
00:12:25.411,00:12:28.956,"Since it's Saturday, would it be all right if I go back to bed for a little while?"
00:12:29.540,00:12:31.000,"Yes, that's fine."
00:12:31.417,00:12:33.461,I'll be leaving for Rachel's soon.
00:12:35.045,00:12:38.215,Growing up is certainly a trial by fire.
00:12:38.299,00:12:40.384,"Well, since you are indeed growing up..."
00:12:41.510,00:12:44.930,"if you would like to invite Diana for tea today, you may."
00:12:46.098,00:12:49.435,Tea? With Diana as my guest?
00:12:49.518,00:12:50.644,Only if you're up to it.
00:12:54.857,00:12:58.194,Or else you'd never have understood how I've longed for this very thing.
00:12:58.777,00:13:02.698,A grown-up tea is one of my highest ideals of earthly bliss!
00:13:05.701,00:13:09.288,"-But I have nothing to wear! -Oh, you have two perfectly good dresses."
00:13:09.371,00:13:12.625,"But they won't do for tea without puff sleeves! Matthew, tell her!"
00:13:13.834,00:13:16.670,She's been dreaming of those since the day we met.
00:13:16.754,00:13:19.965,And since well before. Could you add puff sleeves to my gray dress?
00:13:20.049,00:13:21.800,I've never heard such foolishness.
00:13:21.884,00:13:24.720,"But it wouldn't take too long. Please, Marilla, please!"
00:13:24.803,00:13:26.722,I am the only girl without them!
00:13:26.805,00:13:28.516,Do you want tea today or not?
00:13:30.267,00:13:33.521,I do. I'm sorry. I'll try to stop longing for things I can never have.
00:13:33.604,00:13:34.897,I promise I'll try harder.
00:13:34.980,00:13:41.237,"You can open this little yellow crock of cherry preserves, and you can cut some fruitcake and have some of the cookies and snaps."
00:13:43.489,00:13:45.366,and asking Diana if she takes sugar.
00:13:45.449,00:13:47.284,"I know she doesn't, of course, but..."
00:13:47.368,00:13:49.370,"I'll ask her, just as if I didn't know."
00:13:49.870,00:13:51.872,-May we sit in the parlor? -You may.
00:13:51.956,00:13:54.542,And you may have some of the raspberry cordial as well.
00:13:54.625,00:13:56.460,"Oh, thank you!"
00:13:56.544,00:13:58.420,"I must get dressed, and run and ask Diana!"
00:13:58.504,00:14:01.215,It might turn out that I like being a grown-up after all.
00:14:01.298,00:14:03.008,Don't overexert yourself.
00:14:07.388,00:14:11.809,"-Oh, Matthew! -Oh, there, uh, seemed to be a-a-a draft."
00:14:20.442,00:14:21.443,Ah!
00:14:25.322,00:14:26.991,I'll be gone most of the day.
00:14:31.161,00:14:34.582,You let Miss Cuthbert know... I've gone to Carmody.
00:14:34.665,00:14:36.500,"-Head out to the gate now. -Yes, sir."
00:15:13.329,00:15:16.540,Would you care for some sugar? I'm ever so delighted that you could attend.
00:15:19.793,00:15:21.128,Must be Saturday.
00:15:24.006,00:15:25.674,"Nice to have you here, son."
00:15:26.884,00:15:28.427,Will you read my favorite?
00:15:36.644,00:15:40.105,"Healthy, free, the world before me."
00:15:40.940,00:15:46.028,The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.
00:16:24.984,00:16:26.819,"Good day, sir. May I assist you?"
00:16:28.654,00:16:29.655,No.
00:16:36.328,00:16:37.788,Not now.
00:16:51.510,00:16:53.595,"Mr. Cuthbert, isn't it? Oh!"
00:16:53.679,00:16:56.682,-Yes. -We haven't seen you in a while.
00:16:57.266,00:16:58.684,What can we get for you today?
00:16:58.767,00:17:02.146,We've got a special price on winter boots. Big selection. Come in. Come in.
00:17:02.229,00:17:03.564,"I, uh..."
00:17:04.189,00:17:05.357,"The, um..."
00:17:12.489,00:17:14.283,May I take your hat and coat?
00:17:14.700,00:17:15.993,"Why, thank you."
00:17:16.577,00:17:20.039,"-I trust your family is well? -Quite well, thank you kindly."
00:17:27.588,00:17:30.090,Your table is exquisite!
00:17:31.425,00:17:32.926,How nice of you to say.
00:17:33.010,00:17:37.014,Won't you please sit down whilst I set the tea to steep and fetch the cordial?
00:17:37.097,00:17:40.142,There are so many responsibilities when one is hosting company.
00:17:46.982,00:17:50.652,"Raspberry cordial, where are you?"
00:17:52.696,00:17:53.822,Mmm.
00:17:58.619,00:17:59.661,Hmm.
00:18:30.109,00:18:33.362,You're back. Surely there's something I can help you with?
00:18:34.071,00:18:35.280,Yes.
00:18:38.450,00:18:42.621,"-Would you like to look at dress styles? -I, uh... I..."
00:18:42.996,00:18:44.456,We have ever so many to choose from.
00:18:50.045,00:18:51.046,It's...
00:19:15.445,00:19:17.406,Winter can indeed be savage.
00:19:18.365,00:19:20.200,"Please, allow me."
00:19:20.826,00:19:21.994,You're too kind.
00:19:22.744,00:19:25.455,"I love bright-red drinks, don't you?"
00:19:26.331,00:19:28.041,They taste twice as good as any other color.
00:19:29.376,00:19:31.753,Je vous remercie de vos belles manières.
00:19:31.837,00:19:32.838,That's French!
00:19:32.921,00:19:34.590,You speak French?
00:19:34.673,00:19:36.675,Oui. Je parle français couramment.
00:19:36.758,00:19:40.429,Could there be anything more perfect than you speaking a romance language?
00:19:40.512,00:19:42.681,My two favorite things together.
00:19:44.516,00:19:46.935,Mother plans to send me to finishing school in France.
00:19:47.019,00:19:50.939,Really? Will you take me with you? You have to take me!
00:19:51.940,00:19:53.734,Si vous m'en versez un peu plus.
00:19:54.818,00:19:56.570,Uh... Oui?
00:19:59.907,00:20:08.332,"This cordial seems to be a different cordial from the cordial we toasted with when I became a Cuthbert, but I believe I like it better."
00:20:18.091,00:20:29.186,I have decided There is so much to look forward to when we are even older.
00:20:30.187,00:20:31.063,Bosoms!
00:20:33.815,00:20:35.108,We get to wear corsets.
00:20:35.192,00:20:37.361,Because we'll have bosoms!
00:20:39.029,00:20:41.281,Isn't it wonderful how we agree on everything?
00:20:41.907,00:20:43.700,Isn't it wonderful to be so grown-up?
00:20:43.784,00:20:45.035,Mm.
00:20:47.913,00:20:49.539,"-Oh, no. -Hmm?"
00:20:58.382,00:21:00.759,"It's Anne, with an E."
00:21:00.842,00:21:02.135,Lovely.
00:21:02.928,00:21:04.179,What does she look like?
00:21:04.263,00:21:13.021,"Uh, well, her hair is red, and she doesn't care for it, but, I mean, I think it's just... it's fine."
00:21:13.105,00:21:14.773,Does she have a favorite color?
00:21:14.856,00:21:18.610,"Oh, um... I-I couldn't say that, uh, for certain."
00:21:18.694,00:21:23.198,But she loves trees and flowers and such.
00:21:23.824,00:21:28.161,She's got a lot of romantic notions... about life.
00:21:28.245,00:21:31.248,"Oh, so maybe something with a little flounce. Ruffles perhaps."
00:21:31.331,00:21:36.795,And she's got a longing for a certain type of sleeve.
00:21:42.968,00:21:46.346,-With air. It's on the sides. -Puff sleeves?
00:21:46.430,00:21:47.347,Oh.
00:21:47.431,00:21:49.057,De rigueur.
00:21:49.516,00:21:51.310,"Oh, and, uh... Sorry."
00:21:51.393,00:21:53.854,-I brought this. -Oh.
00:21:54.688,00:21:56.189,Sorry. That's...
00:21:57.482,00:22:00.485,That's for the... the boots. Wait.
00:22:03.864,00:22:05.615,So this is her size.
00:22:06.658,00:22:09.578,With a little room for growing.
00:22:12.873,00:22:16.585,I can see why she's longing for the latest fashion.
00:22:17.210,00:22:19.629,Marilla was always a very practical person.
00:22:20.881,00:22:25.010,"I'll use this as a pattern for the size, but everything else will be au courant."
00:22:25.635,00:22:27.012,Vivienne?
00:22:28.597,00:22:31.099,"Please take down these measurements. Thank you, dear."
00:22:32.350,00:22:34.895,I'm not worried about the cost.
00:22:35.187,00:22:37.773,Just as long as she likes it.
00:22:38.148,00:22:42.986,This dress will be her dream come true. And I'll give you the old-friend discount.
00:22:44.196,00:22:45.405,"That's, um..."
00:22:46.239,00:22:48.200,"That's very kind of you, Jeannie."
00:22:50.035,00:22:53.538,Matthew... would you like to stay for tea?
00:22:55.415,00:22:59.294,"-It'll be a few minutes to measure. -Oh, I-I don't know."
00:22:59.377,00:23:01.588,"I live right upstairs, just above the shop."
00:23:02.380,00:23:06.426,I'd hate to see you ride all that way back to Avonlea without fortification.
00:23:11.348,00:23:13.934,All right then. Much obliged.
00:23:24.319,00:23:25.278,Ready?
00:23:26.488,00:23:27.322,One.
00:23:30.992,00:23:35.956,"Uh, she's a real bright little thing, and she talks a mile a minute."
00:23:36.039,00:23:39.459,Always something interesting to say.
00:23:39.543,00:23:42.963,So you barely have to say a word. Must be heaven.
00:23:46.508,00:23:48.135,But you make yourself known.
00:23:59.396,00:24:02.399,You once left a little something on my desk at school.
00:24:05.902,00:24:06.778,Did I?
00:24:07.529,00:24:09.156,You don't remember?
00:24:54.659,00:24:55.702,Hmm.
00:25:07.881,00:25:10.634,Anyone else would have made a show of giving it to me.
00:25:13.386,00:25:15.847,You knew I collected buttons.
00:25:16.139,00:25:19.017,I told you when you walked me home that time.
00:25:24.272,00:25:28.151,It wasn't long after... that you left school.
00:25:29.444,00:25:31.196,I was worried about you.
00:25:34.991,00:25:38.370,We were all so sorry when your brother passed away.
00:25:47.545,00:25:48.797,Um...
00:25:50.507,00:25:52.509,Yeah. I best be on my way.
00:25:55.595,00:25:57.055,Of course.
00:25:57.973,00:25:58.890,Uh...
00:25:59.182,00:26:02.435,Anne... Anne's dress should be ready in about a week.
00:26:04.312,00:26:05.772,"Very kind of you, Jeannie."
00:26:07.691,00:26:09.150,"It was, uh..."
00:26:09.943,00:26:12.904,"It was good to see you. I-I look forward to seeing you, then."
00:26:55.822,00:26:58.742,So this should just about be enough for my extended family.
00:26:58.825,00:27:01.703,However did you manage to have ten children?
00:27:02.495,00:27:04.956,You were expecting for at least two decades.
00:27:07.208,00:27:09.169,"-Oh, hello, dear. -Hello."
00:27:10.253,00:27:11.713,I hope you're not begging tea.
00:27:11.796,00:27:15.925,"No, no. I was just, uh-- 'Cause we're up to our britches, aren't we, Marilla?"
00:27:18.720,00:27:20.347,Would you like a little lick?
00:27:20.722,00:27:23.266,"Ooh. I could fancy that, yes."
00:27:27.228,00:27:29.022,Mmm. Mmm.
00:27:33.943,00:27:35.487,-Off you go. -Mm.
00:27:42.702,00:27:47.207,"At this point, it's all about managing expectations. Hmm."
00:27:48.166,00:27:51.628,"You know, I could do with a spot of tea, now that it's come up. You?"
00:27:51.711,00:27:54.631,Please. I need a little bracing.
00:27:57.092,00:28:00.220,How do you suppose Anne is faring with her grown-up ladies' tea?
00:28:00.303,00:28:03.014,"Oh, I'm sure it's a very dignified affair."
00:28:07.310,00:28:11.189,"Jerry, hurry and hitch up the buggy!"
00:28:15.235,00:28:18.947,"Jerry, fetch me some rose water before I have a fainting spell."
00:28:24.035,00:28:26.121,Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
00:28:28.373,00:28:29.416,Oh!
00:28:56.985,00:28:58.445,Mother!
00:29:12.542,00:29:16.171,"As you can see, this is a disgraceful scene."
00:29:16.254,00:29:17.255,"My word, Anne."
00:29:17.338,00:29:19.966,You certainly have a genius for getting into trouble.
00:29:24.345,00:29:27.932,-I can't imagine why you had any. -It was for medicinal purposes.
00:29:29.350,00:29:33.104,"But when the minister disapproved, I threw the remainder away long ago."
00:29:33.730,00:29:34.564,Or so I thought.
00:29:35.190,00:29:39.235,Your... charge... is a bad influence on my daughter.
00:29:39.319,00:29:42.572,Anne made an honest mistake. I'm to blame.
00:29:42.655,00:29:45.575,This is the last time my Diana will ever set foot in your house.
00:29:46.367,00:29:49.245,"Please, Mrs. Barry. I didn't mean to set Diana drunk."
00:29:49.329,00:29:52.332,You are not a fit little girl for Diana to associate with.
00:29:52.415,00:29:54.167,But it wasn't on purpose!
00:29:58.880,00:30:02.926,They are not to fraternize in any manner at any time.
00:30:06.137,00:30:07.847,for all that has transpired.
00:30:07.931,00:30:10.767,Might I suggest a duration of two weeks?
00:30:10.850,00:30:15.980,I must preserve my Diana from the contamination of further intimacy with such a child.
00:30:16.606,00:30:17.816,My judgment is final!
00:31:20.628,00:31:23.089,What on earth possessed you to buy all those boots?
00:31:25.383,00:31:27.218,It was a frivolous expense.
00:31:28.219,00:31:29.679,They'll have to go back.
00:31:33.391,00:31:35.810,Do you ever think...
00:31:36.853,00:31:37.896,about Michael?
00:31:42.650,00:31:43.735,Yes.
00:31:46.195,00:31:48.031,So much would have been different.
00:31:50.116,00:31:51.826,-If he hadn't-- -Yes.
00:31:54.913,00:31:56.164,Good night.
00:32:43.628,00:32:45.213,Poor little soul.
00:33:27.130,00:33:28.423,Not going to school today?
00:33:32.385,00:33:34.053,I feel like I should...
00:33:34.470,00:33:36.097,I should stay close.
00:33:54.449,00:33:58.870,"You are not to fraternize, or exert undue influence."
00:33:58.953,00:34:01.497,"Ruby, switch places with Anne."
00:34:32.111,00:34:33.654,Will your mother never relent?
00:34:33.738,00:34:36.991,"I've cried and cried, and told her over and over again that it wasn't your fault."
00:34:37.658,00:34:38.701,It isn't any use.
00:34:40.745,00:34:43.081,So this is an eternal farewell.
00:34:45.291,00:34:48.544,Then we must speak the most pathetic language that we can think of.
00:34:48.628,00:34:50.254,With thees and thous?
00:34:51.255,00:34:54.509,That way we will never forget the pathos of this moment.
00:35:01.557,00:35:03.518,wilt thou promise faithfully...
00:35:04.102,00:35:07.396,"never to forget me, the friend of your youth?"
00:35:08.231,00:35:11.526,I'll never have another bosom friend. I don't want to.
00:35:13.361,00:35:16.739,"I could never love anyone as I love you, Anne. Thou."
00:35:17.782,00:35:20.451,Wait. You love me?
00:35:22.036,00:35:25.081,Of course I do. Why don't you know that?
00:35:25.832,00:35:29.961,"Well, I thought you liked me, of course, but I never hoped you loved me."
00:35:30.920,00:35:32.505,"I love you devotedly, Anne."
00:35:33.381,00:35:36.300,"Then I will always love thee, Diana."
00:35:37.343,00:35:42.723,"In the years to come, your memory will shine like a star over my lonely life."
00:35:46.102,00:35:48.855,Let us offer each other locks of our hair...
00:36:08.040,00:36:12.795,I bestow upon thou this symbol of my enduring love.
00:36:13.671,00:36:16.841,"Fare thee well, dearest Anne of Green Gables."
00:36:18.384,00:36:21.554,"Henceforth, we must be strangers living side by side."
00:36:41.115,00:36:43.242,Take these lessons to Gilbert Blythe.
00:36:43.326,00:36:47.163,"He'll be missing class for a time, and I don't want him falling too far behind."
00:36:47.246,00:36:48.748,He's my best student.
00:36:50.249,00:36:52.877,-Why is he missing class? -That is none of your concern.
00:36:52.960,00:36:54.462,"Now, hurry along."
00:36:55.713,00:36:57.048,Scat!
00:37:14.982,00:37:16.776,Why does everything happen to me?
00:37:20.321,00:37:21.864,Gilbert?
00:37:23.783,00:37:25.534,Gilbert Blythe!
00:37:38.172,00:37:39.632,Finally.
00:37:42.927,00:37:44.053,Sorry to make you wait.
00:37:45.805,00:37:47.056,Gilbert...
00:37:48.266,00:37:50.309,is out back chopping wood.
00:37:52.436,00:37:54.105,What wonderful red hair.
00:37:55.773,00:37:57.817,"You're the Cuthberts' new charge, aren't you?"
00:37:58.401,00:38:01.279,-Yes. -I've heard nice things about you.
00:38:05.741,00:38:07.702,"Dad, what are you doing?"
00:38:08.452,00:38:11.205,-You shouldn't be walking. -My son worries too much.
00:38:11.789,00:38:14.792,It seems this young lady has urgent business with you.
00:38:14.875,00:38:16.585,I'll go inside now.
00:38:16.669,00:38:19.505,"-I'll fetch your chair. -No, I-I-I'll go on my own."
00:38:19.922,00:38:21.173,"Thank you, son."
00:38:21.424,00:38:24.885,It was nice to meet you. Give my kind regards to Marilla.
00:38:25.469,00:38:27.388,"I will. Of course, Mr. Blythe."
00:38:33.144,00:38:34.061,Those for me?
00:38:41.277,00:38:42.278,"Well, uh..."
00:38:42.903,00:38:44.488,It's kind of you to bring them by.
00:38:45.156,00:38:47.074,Mr. Phillips doesn't want you falling behind.
00:38:47.742,00:38:49.035,"I don't, either."
00:38:50.286,00:38:53.789,"If you're gonna beat me in class, I want you to do it fair and square."
00:38:55.207,00:38:56.667,Yes. Exactly.
00:38:57.501,00:38:58.377,Um...
00:38:58.461,00:38:59.879,Thank you.
00:39:00.713,00:39:01.547,I'll see you.
00:39:30.493,00:39:31.827,That was fast.
00:39:34.455,00:39:37.166,"I wanted to make it quickly, so Diana doesn't forget me."
00:39:38.125,00:39:41.545,I'm happy to report that my flowering time is finally over.
00:39:42.088,00:39:45.424,I feel much older and wiser than before.
00:39:46.008,00:39:48.260,And I won't be emotional next time.
00:39:48.719,00:39:52.264,I have come to realize that there are far bigger worries in the world.
00:39:55.976,00:40:03.401,"So, buy the dress after you return the boots, but I'm... I'm hoping this will be enough."
00:40:03.484,00:40:08.280,"Oh, and I must have picked this up by mistake. At the dress shop."
00:40:08.364,00:40:11.575,"Please, just... You return that to Miss Jeannie."
00:40:17.873,00:40:20.042,I hope Mr. Cuthbert's well.
00:40:20.126,00:40:22.044,"Yes, madam. He's quite well."
00:40:22.753,00:40:26.257,"I'm glad. Well, please tell him I'm sorry not to have seen him today."
00:40:26.340,00:40:27.550,"Yes, madam."
00:40:29.677,00:40:30.719,Oh.
00:40:31.345,00:40:32.638,I almost forgot.
00:40:32.721,00:40:35.057,Mr. Cuthbert said I'm to give you this.
00:40:40.354,00:40:41.397,Au revoir.
00:40:55.703,00:40:57.538,"Oh. Hello, Matthew."
00:41:55.679,00:41:56.680,Thank you!
00:42:29.171,00:42:32.216,"You've gone and spoiled the child, Matthew."
00:42:33.926,00:42:35.719,She's not a child anymore.
00:42:37.263,00:42:40.683,"Can we be a little bit late to church, so everyone can see me walking in?"
00:42:43.477,00:42:47.189,"Matthew Cuthbert, you're missing a button from your best Sunday shirt."
00:42:47.273,00:42:51.277,"Nah, I'm fine... like this, Marilla."
00:42:58.409,00:43:00.953,If you please... Miss.
00:43:02.621,00:43:03.831,Mm.
00:43:15.092,00:43:16.093,Walk on.
00:00:40.373,00:00:41.374,Help me!
00:00:42.792,00:00:44.169,Please help me!
00:00:47.964,00:00:49.007,Anne!
00:00:49.507,00:00:51.509,"-Diana? -Minnie May, she's sick."
00:00:51.593,00:00:54.220,-We need to wake Miss Cuthbert. -She went to see the premier.
00:00:54.304,00:00:56.264,-Did your parents go as well? -Yes!
00:00:57.682,00:00:59.017,What's wrong with Minnie May?
00:00:59.100,00:01:01.519,I don't know. She's choking and coughing. It's horrible!
00:01:02.187,00:01:03.188,Croup.
00:01:03.271,00:01:04.647,We need the doctor.
00:01:09.569,00:01:11.780,Put this on you before you catch your death.
00:01:11.863,00:01:14.949,"Aunt Josephine is staying with us, but she doesn't know what to do."
00:01:15.033,00:01:17.952,-She's never seen a cough like this. -I have.
00:01:19.037,00:01:22.415,"Matthew, ride to Carmody and fetch the doctor. Minnie May is gravely ill."
00:01:22.499,00:01:24.918,-I'll go home with Diana. -We'll see you there.
00:01:30.548,00:01:32.133,I need to fetch the ipecac before we go.
00:01:32.217,00:01:35.720,Matthew won't be back for hours. I will do everything I can until then.
00:01:35.804,00:01:38.097,-I've missed you so much. -I've missed you too.
00:02:34.070,00:02:36.573,Lean her over. Make sure she's right above the steam.
00:02:36.656,00:02:38.741,We have to loosen the phlegm that's choking her.
00:02:43.705,00:02:46.207,I want to get by with steam and night air until we're forced to use it.
00:02:46.291,00:02:49.168,-She's burning up. -Let's lift her up to the window.
00:02:50.503,00:02:51.963,Breathing cold air will help.
00:02:59.220,00:03:01.514,What on earth do you think you're doing?
00:03:01.598,00:03:03.182,Do you wish her to freeze to death as well?
00:03:03.266,00:03:06.185,Cold air is a doctor's best friend when it comes to treating croup.
00:03:06.269,00:03:08.771,You are not a doctor. I do not condone this!
00:03:08.855,00:03:12.901,"I know what I'm doing. Sorry, if you could please stay out of the way?"
00:03:17.280,00:03:20.366,"Dear God, please save this child."
00:03:25.204,00:03:26.623,"Oh, isn't she lovely?"
00:03:29.208,00:03:30.543,She's watching over you.
00:03:31.127,00:03:35.131,"I wish you had some peppermint or eucalyptus, so I could make a plaster."
00:03:35.215,00:03:36.216,I'll fetch an onion.
00:03:37.217,00:03:38.593,Pardon me.
00:03:39.260,00:03:42.055,How much longer will it be before that blasted doctor comes?
00:03:44.098,00:03:47.310,"Sorry, it would really help if you could keep out of the way."
00:03:47.393,00:03:49.854,What would help would be a medical professional.
00:03:49.938,00:03:52.190,"I expect they'll be another hour or two, if they come at all."
00:03:52.273,00:03:53.858,Why do you say that?
00:03:53.942,00:03:56.653,Almost everyone went to Charlottetown to see the premier.
00:03:56.736,00:03:59.989,-That is precisely why I left. -It remains to be seen if the doctor went.
00:04:00.073,00:04:03.076,Next you'll be brewing eye of newt in a cauldron!
00:04:03.159,00:04:06.204,Raw onion on the soles of the feet helps to bring a fever down.
00:04:07.163,00:04:09.457,-You haven't ever heard of that? -Why would I have?
00:04:09.540,00:04:11.167,Because it's an old wives' tale.
00:04:11.251,00:04:13.711,"I might be one, but not the other."
00:04:14.629,00:04:17.632,"Evidently, one doesn't have to be either thing to know it."
00:04:17.715,00:04:18.758,That's true enough.
00:04:18.841,00:04:22.262,"In any case, I believe it works, and I'm not above a desperate measure or two."
00:04:22.345,00:04:27.642,"If I had a desperate measure to offer, I would, but I know nothing of children or their illnesses."
00:04:29.102,00:04:32.355,"Mrs. Hammond had twins three times, so I know quite a lot about it."
00:04:34.607,00:04:36.526,My whole life before Green Gables.
00:04:36.609,00:04:40.863,"So the Cuthberts brought you on to look after them in their dotage, did they?"
00:04:40.947,00:04:45.034,"No, I was supposed to be a boy, but when I wasn't, they decided to keep and raise me."
00:04:45.118,00:04:46.494,How extraordinary.
00:04:46.577,00:04:47.704,I agree!
00:04:59.173,00:05:01.551,Roll her onto her belly! Hold her feet!
00:05:05.346,00:05:07.724,"Come on, Minnie May! Cough! Cough, Minnie May! Cough!"
00:05:08.349,00:05:10.351,-She's slipping! -Miss Barry!
00:05:10.435,00:05:12.645,"Come on, Minnie May! Come on!"
00:05:12.729,00:05:15.565,"-Cough, Minnie May! Cough! -She's not breathing."
00:05:19.652,00:05:21.696,"Cough, Minnie May! Cough! Come on! Cough!"
00:05:21.779,00:05:23.656,Come on! Cough! Cough!
00:05:23.740,00:05:26.284,"Cough, Minnie May! Cough!"
00:05:31.372,00:05:33.082,-Thank God. -Merciful Lord.
00:05:33.166,00:05:34.625,That's done it! Pull her up!
00:05:54.562,00:05:55.688,"Oh, Anne..."
00:06:00.318,00:06:01.736,Let's get her to bed.
00:06:08.451,00:06:10.119,I believe the worst is over.
00:06:14.082,00:06:16.417,I believe I need a brandy.
00:06:47.532,00:06:50.201,"She saved that child's life, pure and simple."
00:06:51.119,00:06:56.415,I must admit she's got a presence of mind quite unusual in a child her age.
00:06:57.250,00:07:00.711,Hmm. I'd... I'd best get her home.
00:07:05.508,00:07:06.592,Anne.
00:07:08.386,00:07:09.720,Anne...
00:07:11.722,00:07:13.224,it's time to go.
00:07:19.730,00:07:23.526,"Oh, Matthew, isn't it a beautiful morning?"
00:07:32.076,00:07:33.369,Poof!
00:07:39.459,00:07:43.379,"I'm so glad I live in a world where there are white frosts, aren't you?"
00:07:43.463,00:07:44.297,Yeah.
00:07:44.380,00:07:50.178,"And I'm so glad Mrs. Hammond had three pairs of twins, or I mightn't have known what to do."
00:07:50.261,00:07:52.597,Life's funny like that.
00:07:53.473,00:07:56.476,Won't Marilla be surprised when she hears what she missed?
00:07:57.393,00:07:58.644,Won't she just.
00:08:17.872,00:08:18.873,Matthew?
00:08:21.000,00:08:23.085,"Matthew, are you all right?"
00:08:23.169,00:08:25.880,"Oh. Ooh, uh, good, you're back."
00:08:26.547,00:08:28.090,"Um, how was Charlottetown?"
00:08:28.174,00:08:30.426,Why are you sleeping in the middle of the day?
00:08:30.510,00:08:32.929,"Uh, it's all right, Marilla."
00:08:33.012,00:08:35.097,I expect Anne will sleep the day away as well.
00:08:35.181,00:08:37.517,What's happened? What's wrong? Is she ill?
00:08:37.600,00:08:39.894,"Oh, look, there's no need to fret."
00:08:39.977,00:08:42.563,How about I tell you over a cup of coffee?
00:08:43.105,00:08:44.690,I could use some coffee.
00:09:03.876,00:09:05.294,You know what I...
00:09:05.378,00:09:06.587,"Oh, can I get you something?"
00:09:08.297,00:09:09.549,You know...
00:09:10.925,00:09:13.344,what was the best thing about getting sick?
00:09:14.804,00:09:16.597,Traveling west again.
00:09:17.431,00:09:19.058,I'll fetch you both some tea.
00:09:21.811,00:09:23.104,The train.
00:09:24.272,00:09:25.982,"God, I love a train."
00:09:26.691,00:09:28.401,And those Rocky Mountains.
00:09:29.819,00:09:31.070,They're amazing.
00:09:31.779,00:09:33.281,Did my heart good.
00:09:34.699,00:09:36.325,"It's a big world, son."
00:09:38.160,00:09:39.745,Remember that.
00:09:52.967,00:09:54.468,"Good afternoon, Marilla."
00:09:55.469,00:09:56.596,Eliza.
00:09:58.681,00:10:00.099,I've come to apologize.
00:10:01.475,00:10:05.438,May I please see your wonderful... remarkable Anne?
00:10:06.147,00:10:09.984,"She's still sleeping, but you're welcome to come on in."
00:10:19.452,00:10:20.870,"Good day, Mrs. Barry."
00:10:31.380,00:10:33.966,"Afternoon, Marilla. We missed you."
00:10:34.050,00:10:37.053,Did you see the premier? What did he look like?
00:10:37.136,00:10:42.558,"Well, he never got to be premier on account of his looks, but I was proud of being a Conservative."
00:10:42.642,00:10:45.853,"Rachel, being a Liberal, had no use for him."
00:10:45.936,00:10:47.438,Come along. Let's get you fed.
00:10:47.521,00:10:48.981,I expect you must be hungry.
00:10:49.065,00:10:50.608,I'm starving!
00:10:50.691,00:10:53.110,Did Matthew recount the events of last night?
00:10:58.908,00:11:01.369,I wouldn't have had any idea myself.
00:11:01.452,00:11:02.995,I never saw a case of croup.
00:11:03.079,00:11:05.039,You know what was extra wonderful about it all?
00:11:05.706,00:11:08.292,I got to spend time with my darling Diana.
00:11:08.376,00:11:12.004,"It's been an agony not speaking at school, an utter agony."
00:11:12.838,00:11:15.049,"It's been a long month, indeed."
00:11:16.217,00:11:20.805,"I was so sorrowful to leave her this morning, knowing it will all go back to how it's been."
00:11:26.519,00:11:27.603,Why?
00:11:27.686,00:11:35.027,"Because when I tell you who just visited here, your reaction will lift you clear out of the region of such material matters as appetite."
00:11:37.446,00:11:39.490,Mrs. Barry paid a call today...
00:11:40.491,00:11:45.037,and she hopes you'll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again.
00:11:46.747,00:11:47.998,I-I-I'll wash it later!
00:11:48.082,00:11:52.586,I-I can't tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishes at this thrilling moment!
00:11:53.087,00:11:54.630,Anne! Take a coat!
00:12:17.945,00:12:19.363,Gilbert!
00:12:20.865,00:12:21.866,Gilbert!
00:12:22.658,00:12:23.701,Gilbert!
00:12:25.703,00:12:27.037,Gilbert!
00:12:38.007,00:12:39.925,Anne! Anne!
00:12:43.971,00:12:46.724,"Oh, aren't you almost nearly perfectly happy?"
00:12:46.807,00:12:52.271,"Our separation has been an excruciating torment, but I'm so relieved it's finally over."
00:12:52.354,00:12:54.773,Mother could hardly keep us apart as you saved Minnie May.
00:12:54.857,00:12:58.402,"Even Aunt Josephine said she'd see you again, and she doesn't like anyone."
00:12:58.486,00:13:00.821,Wasn't she only staying while your parents were away?
00:13:00.905,00:13:03.282,"Uh, no, no. She's come to stay with us for at least a month."
00:13:03.365,00:13:05.784,I don't quite know how we'll stand it. She's so particular.
00:13:05.868,00:13:11.415,"But she suffered a loss. She's grieving, so she's disinclined to stay home alone since her companion passed away."
00:13:11.499,00:13:12.500,Her companion?
00:13:13.584,00:13:15.544,Her best friend forever and ever.
00:13:23.677,00:13:26.180,They lived with each other their whole lives.
00:13:27.139,00:13:34.730,"I'd live with you forever if I could, but I know you'll leave me the day you get married to some wealthy and handsome gentleman."
00:13:34.813,00:13:35.814,I hate him already.
00:13:36.899,00:13:39.235,-How's Gilbert? -You're not funny.
00:13:39.318,00:13:41.487,"You see him almost every day after school, do you not?"
00:13:41.570,00:13:44.198,Not because I want to. It's because I have to.
00:13:44.782,00:13:47.409,Mr. Phillips makes me go. I've explained this to Ruby.
00:13:47.493,00:13:48.953,Do I have to explain it to you as well?
00:13:53.916,00:13:55.501,Is his father almost well?
00:14:01.090,00:14:03.175,I think I'm a terrible person.
00:14:03.259,00:14:05.344,What? Why?
00:14:05.928,00:14:09.723,-I hadn't thought about it before. -Hadn't thought about what?
00:14:10.391,00:14:14.228,It's very likely Gilbert's father isn't going to get well.
00:14:14.937,00:14:18.941,So it's more than possible that when Gilbert finally comes back to school...
00:14:19.817,00:14:21.110,he'll be an orphan.
00:15:04.278,00:15:06.655,Let not your heart be troubled.
00:15:07.239,00:15:11.869,"Ye believe in God, believe also in me."
00:15:13.078,00:15:15.915,In my father's house are many mansions.
00:15:16.415,00:15:19.209,"If it were not so, I would have told you."
00:15:20.336,00:15:23.005,I go to prepare a place for you.
00:15:23.088,00:15:29.929,"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself..."
00:15:31.430,00:15:35.809,"for where I am, there ye may be also."
00:17:03.313,00:17:04.523,It's all right. It's all right.
00:17:13.532,00:17:14.491,"Oh, no, thank you."
00:17:27.463,00:17:30.924,"You laugh, but I think it's a fine chapeau."
00:17:31.467,00:17:34.553,Cosmopolitan. All the city folks are wearing them.
00:17:35.179,00:17:36.305,Why don't you like it?
00:17:38.724,00:17:39.892,Room to grow.
00:17:39.975,00:17:43.020,I'm sure it'll fit better when you acquire some more brains.
00:17:44.897,00:17:48.692,"Oh, show me mercy, Mar! Mercy, please."
00:17:53.363,00:17:58.035,Perhaps this might persuade you to offer me a morsel of kindness?
00:17:59.536,00:18:01.038,I make no promises.
00:18:01.121,00:18:02.706,I would expect none.
00:18:03.874,00:18:04.708,May I?
00:18:48.168,00:18:50.838,"Oh... No, thank you. I'm fine."
00:19:24.913,00:19:26.248,Gilbert!
00:19:32.629,00:19:34.214,It was a lovely service.
00:19:35.215,00:19:37.050,It seemed fitting somehow.
00:19:41.471,00:19:45.726,"I've always thought the minister prays quite mournfully, so this suited him nicely."
00:19:47.186,00:19:49.104,Baptisms must be grim.
00:19:52.149,00:19:58.071,"Being an orphan has its challenges, but you already have so many advantages, you'll be much better off than I was."
00:19:59.031,00:20:00.199,And...
00:20:00.824,00:20:02.784,I didn't know my parents.
00:20:02.868,00:20:07.080,"They died when I was a baby, so I couldn't fend for myself the way that you can."
00:20:07.164,00:20:11.835,"And I don't remember my parents at all, but you'll always be able to remember your father."
00:20:13.003,00:20:16.048,"You know, when you think about it, you're really very lucky."
00:20:17.299,00:20:18.508,You think I'm lucky?
00:20:19.092,00:20:20.969,Compared to me? Yes.
00:20:21.553,00:20:22.971,And why is this about you?
00:20:23.805,00:20:27.768,It's not. I was just trying to-- See you.
00:20:31.855,00:20:32.940,Uh...
00:20:46.536,00:20:50.582,Fine then! Don't get the benefit of my extensive knowledge about being an orphan!
00:20:52.960,00:20:55.337,No matter how sad you look.
00:20:58.757,00:21:01.093,No need to think about him anymore. Done.
00:21:01.176,00:21:04.346,I have wasted quite enough energy on some dumb boy.
00:21:04.429,00:21:08.433,I'm not going to think about Gilbert Blythe for one more second.
00:21:09.643,00:21:11.353,"Brain, stop it."
00:21:14.815,00:21:17.567,-Miss Barry. -No sense to be made of it.
00:21:18.443,00:21:20.237,"-Hello, Anne. -Hello."
00:21:20.320,00:21:21.613,Sorry to interrupt.
00:21:21.697,00:21:23.490,"No, no. I was..."
00:21:23.573,00:21:24.533,Uh...
00:21:24.616,00:21:26.952,May I enter your humble abode?
00:21:28.495,00:21:29.705,Of course.
00:21:38.505,00:21:39.756,Ah.
00:21:43.635,00:21:48.181,I-I should let you know immediately that what you heard just now had nothing to do with romance.
00:21:48.265,00:21:51.476,-I see. -I couldn't be less interested in Gil...
00:21:52.602,00:21:53.895,That boy.
00:21:53.979,00:21:56.148,I've got much better things to do.
00:21:56.231,00:21:59.776,You certainly seem like someone with many possible outcomes.
00:21:59.860,00:22:04.114,"Oh, you've no idea how much it heartens me to hear you say that."
00:22:04.197,00:22:08.452,My advice is to let your ambitions and your aspirations be your guide.
00:22:09.494,00:22:10.871,But I have so many.
00:22:10.954,00:22:12.289,"Oh, good."
00:22:12.372,00:22:15.125,Plenty of time yet. If you're lucky.
00:22:16.668,00:22:17.836,Right.
00:22:19.713,00:22:24.468,There's more than enough time for you to figure out what you want and what you're good at.
00:22:25.719,00:22:29.014,"I'd like to be very, very good at something astonishing."
00:22:30.640,00:22:31.808,I don't seem to fit in.
00:22:31.892,00:22:34.603,All the girls I know are preoccupied with becoming a wife.
00:22:35.687,00:22:37.064,What do you think about that?
00:22:37.689,00:22:42.486,"Well, I've always wanted to be a bride, but I don't really expect to be a wife."
00:22:43.070,00:22:44.404,Interesting.
00:22:44.488,00:22:46.740,-So you see the conundrum? -I do.
00:22:48.658,00:22:51.036,I have the following thoughts to offer.
00:22:51.536,00:22:56.374,"First: you can get married anytime in your life, if you choose to do so."
00:22:56.958,00:22:57.959,That's true.
00:22:58.043,00:23:04.091,"And two: if you choose a career, you can buy a white dress yourself, have it made to order, and wear it whenever you want."
00:23:07.886,00:23:10.305,I love that idea!
00:23:10.931,00:23:12.641,I'm going to be my own woman.
00:23:12.724,00:23:15.602,I'm a proponent for making one's own way in the world.
00:23:19.773,00:23:24.694,A certain young lady has impressed upon me the many benefits of taking the winter air.
00:23:27.656,00:23:28.949,Thank you.
00:23:29.866,00:23:30.909,Oh!
00:23:33.203,00:23:34.788,-Miss Barry? -Hmm?
00:23:34.871,00:23:38.667,"You are an inspiration, and I hope I know you all my life."
00:23:38.750,00:23:40.085,I hope so too.
00:23:40.961,00:23:44.965,"If you become a doctor, perhaps you can discover a cure for old age."
00:23:52.347,00:23:55.142,She's independent and never been married.
00:23:55.225,00:23:57.477,She's definitely my new role model.
00:23:57.561,00:24:01.565,She helped me see the light about... my future.
00:24:02.482,00:24:05.402,You and Marilla are also my inspirations.
00:24:09.114,00:24:11.700,I'm going to be the heroine in my own story.
00:24:18.373,00:24:23.003,"Not that I'm thinking about boys at all, because I'm not."
00:24:24.379,00:24:26.089,I choose myself.
00:24:26.173,00:24:28.466,And that way I'll never be disappointed.
00:26:43.435,00:26:46.021,If the key to a man's heart is through his stomach...
00:26:46.104,00:26:47.147,Which it is.
00:26:47.230,00:26:52.402,...then we have to make sure that this is the best shepherd's pie that Gilbert has ever tasted.
00:26:52.485,00:26:56.906,"Being a good cook shouldn't be very high on the list of romantic attributes, if you ask me."
00:26:56.990,00:27:03.496,"If one was interested in romance, which I'm not, I'd like to be noticed for me, not my dinner."
00:27:08.835,00:27:10.253,So what's on the list?
00:27:10.337,00:27:12.922,"My brain, Diana. My personality."
00:27:13.006,00:27:15.133,"As in, who I am."
00:27:15.216,00:27:17.552,I like to believe that's what truly matters.
00:27:17.635,00:27:20.805,If romance matters at all. Which it doesn't.
00:27:20.889,00:27:21.973,"Yes, it does!"
00:27:27.812,00:27:29.397,-I didn't notice. -He does.
00:27:29.481,00:27:30.523,I know!
00:27:30.607,00:27:33.360,Ruby and Gilbert sitting in a tree...
00:27:33.443,00:27:35.528,"-K-I-S-S-- -Minnie May, we're trying to work."
00:27:35.612,00:27:37.697,-I'm cooking. -You're watching.
00:27:37.781,00:27:41.326,"I told you, the only way you get to be here with us is if you're quiet."
00:27:41.409,00:27:44.287,"Don't interrupt, or you'll have to sit with Great-Aunt Josephine."
00:27:44.371,00:27:45.580,No!
00:27:47.749,00:27:49.125,"Excuse me, ma'am."
00:27:52.712,00:27:55.090,I'm being quiet.
00:27:55.173,00:27:56.591,Then you're the only one.
00:27:59.761,00:28:03.598,Take the boy the godforsaken pie before I suffer a mental collapse.
00:28:05.809,00:28:08.937,You girls have been prattling on for hours about nothing.
00:28:09.020,00:28:12.690,"A parlor should be a quiet haven. Instead, it's unbearable."
00:28:13.274,00:28:19.531,It is weak and silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to be required to bear.
00:28:20.115,00:28:22.158,I beg your pardon?
00:28:22.242,00:28:24.619,Jane Eyre. Don't you just love it?
00:28:24.702,00:28:27.664,Ah. I've yet to reach that bit.
00:28:27.747,00:28:29.499,"Chapter six, I believe."
00:28:29.582,00:28:37.090,"Oh, and the ending makes me weep every time. When Rochester-- For heaven's sake! Didn't we just establish that I've only begun it?"
00:28:37.757,00:28:38.758,Sorry.
00:28:38.842,00:28:41.386,"I love crying over a good book, don't you?"
00:28:42.220,00:28:46.307,Thus far I find the prose... invigorating.
00:28:47.016,00:28:49.436,More so if I could hear myself think.
00:28:49.519,00:28:53.064,"We'll take the pie straight over to Gilbert as soon as we're done, Aunt Josephine."
00:28:53.148,00:28:54.441,Small mercies.
00:28:56.568,00:28:58.778,I'll report back on the ending.
00:29:04.492,00:29:06.327,Is she always so surly?
00:29:06.411,00:29:07.871,She's always scary.
00:29:07.954,00:29:10.415,The surly part just worsened now that she's sad.
00:29:15.795,00:29:19.716,It must be awful beyond measure to lose someone that you love deeply.
00:29:21.342,00:29:27.265,"In a split second, a heartbeat, they're gone forever..."
00:29:37.984,00:29:39.444,Anne?
00:29:41.654,00:29:43.281,You're crying on the potatoes.
00:29:45.867,00:29:47.076,I'm sorry.
00:29:48.286,00:29:49.496,I'm sorry.
00:29:59.964,00:30:02.050,His father just died.
00:30:02.133,00:30:05.887,-That's what people say when someone dies. -I don't want you to upset him.
00:30:05.970,00:30:08.848,He's already upset because his father just died.
00:30:08.932,00:30:12.852,"Anne, please tell Ruby it's all right to say-- I'm thinking perhaps I should get on home."
00:30:13.812,00:30:15.104,-What? -Why?
00:30:15.188,00:30:17.607,I'm sure Marilla must be needing my help.
00:30:17.690,00:30:19.067,With something.
00:30:19.150,00:30:21.945,Don't be silly. We're almost there.
00:30:22.028,00:30:23.154,Hold my hand.
00:30:26.407,00:30:27.367,I'm so nervous!
00:30:39.754,00:30:43.842,"We're sorry to intrude, but we wanted you to have that."
00:30:45.760,00:30:47.136,We're sorry for your loss.
00:30:49.055,00:30:51.474,We made it together especially for you.
00:30:52.141,00:30:53.268,Thank you.
00:30:55.562,00:30:57.981,Everyone likes shepherd's pie.
00:30:58.064,00:31:00.191,"We hope it's a comfort to you, Gilbert."
00:31:03.403,00:31:04.445,She's a good cook.
00:31:04.529,00:31:06.281,But I would make a terrible wife!
00:31:23.381,00:31:26.092,"Well, um, thank you for stopping by."
00:31:50.199,00:31:52.118,"Marilla, did you ever want to marry?"
00:31:54.370,00:31:55.371,I...
00:31:56.539,00:31:58.917,"There was a time when I thought I would, but..."
00:31:59.918,00:32:01.419,it wasn't possible.
00:32:01.502,00:32:03.463,"Now, come set the table, please."
00:32:04.756,00:32:06.633,That sounds rather tragical.
00:32:07.258,00:32:10.470,Why wasn't it possible? Were you a woman scorned?
00:32:10.553,00:32:12.388,I was not.
00:32:13.473,00:32:15.183,I was needed at home.
00:32:16.434,00:32:17.685,Forever?
00:32:17.769,00:32:21.564,Well... it's just how things worked out.
00:32:22.523,00:32:25.610,My mother never recovered from my older brother's death.
00:32:25.693,00:32:26.903,She...
00:32:30.949,00:32:32.659,Now let me get the breakfast on.
00:32:45.088,00:32:46.923,I'll just add this on.
00:32:47.006,00:32:48.967,"Now you'll settle up today, Matthew?"
00:32:56.849,00:32:57.850,"Hello, Gilbert."
00:33:01.813,00:33:02.939,"So, uh..."
00:33:03.648,00:33:04.857,"bit of a cold snap, eh?"
00:33:04.941,00:33:06.317,True enough.
00:33:08.194,00:33:10.279,"Uh, the other day at the, um..."
00:33:11.948,00:33:16.077,"Uh, I-I noticed that you had to leave a couple fields go fallow."
00:33:16.160,00:33:17.704,I haven't decided yet.
00:33:17.787,00:33:19.163,I'm sorry?
00:33:19.247,00:33:21.040,I'll let you know if I'm going to sell.
00:33:21.124,00:33:22.458,Ooh...
00:33:22.542,00:33:25.628,"No, no. No, I just, um..."
00:33:26.963,00:33:27.964,"I, um..."
00:33:28.548,00:33:34.303,"I only wanted you to know that me and my hand Jerry, we'd be real happy to help out."
00:33:35.179,00:33:39.684,"We'll come on over in the spring, if you like, get you back up and running."
00:33:40.268,00:33:41.644,That's very kind.
00:33:44.355,00:33:45.690,"Truth is, uh..."
00:33:46.941,00:33:48.943,I never really wanted to be a farmer.
00:33:53.823,00:33:55.742,"Well, I'd best get to it."
00:34:04.751,00:34:07.545,"As I was saying, I wonder if you could settle up today."
00:34:08.421,00:34:11.966,Shame about that vessel. Word on the street is you had crops aboard.
00:34:12.050,00:34:13.176,Vessel?
00:34:13.259,00:34:16.345,You didn't hear? Ship went down on the way to the mainland.
00:34:17.597,00:34:19.265,Out of Charlottetown?
00:34:19.348,00:34:23.186,"Mm. The vendor didn't have insurance, so there's no recouping the loss."
00:34:23.269,00:34:24.729,It's a crying shame is what it is.
00:34:26.314,00:34:29.317,"Now, that'll be six dollars and ten, Matthew."
00:34:32.820,00:34:34.781,What was the name of the ship?
00:34:34.864,00:34:36.365,The Dal Marie.
00:34:49.337,00:34:50.505,"Hey, Gilbert!"
00:34:52.924,00:34:54.634,"How's it going, Blythe?"
00:34:54.717,00:34:55.802,Fine.
00:34:56.177,00:34:59.847,"You've gotta come back to school, bud. That ugly orphan's out of control."
00:35:00.431,00:35:01.516,What do you care?
00:35:02.100,00:35:04.393,We need a guy to show her she's not so smart.
00:35:04.477,00:35:07.063,She's smart. Deal with it.
00:35:10.900,00:35:13.653,Why don't you bust out a book and take care of it yourself?
00:35:13.736,00:35:14.987,"Yeah, right."
00:35:15.071,00:35:16.072,"Good one, bud."
00:35:16.864,00:35:18.825,"-I'll give you a tip, OK? -Yeah?"
00:35:18.908,00:35:20.409,I'm not your bud.
00:35:23.371,00:35:26.958,"And if you ever hassle Anne again, you'll regret it."
00:35:27.041,00:35:29.877,"-Yeah, right. -Yeah, right."
00:35:31.671,00:35:32.713,What's your problem?
00:35:34.674,00:35:35.675,Ask me that again.
00:35:36.759,00:35:37.885,"No, seriously."
00:35:38.469,00:35:39.512,Go ahead.
00:35:40.304,00:35:42.640,-Why you gotta be like that? -Ask me!
00:35:46.060,00:35:50.064,"Come on, bud. I don't get you. Seriously, what's your problem?"
00:36:42.116,00:36:44.785,Gilbert. I'm sorry to intrude.
00:36:44.869,00:36:48.414,"Oh. No, not at all, Miss Cuthbert. Please... take your time."
00:36:52.585,00:36:55.421,I wonder how he feels about being so stationary.
00:36:56.005,00:36:58.132,John was a traveler at heart.
00:36:59.634,00:37:02.845,I believe the military moved him around a lot in his early years.
00:37:05.765,00:37:07.183,Full of adventure.
00:37:09.644,00:37:12.063,I'd heard he'd settled in Alberta?
00:37:12.897,00:37:14.065,Um...
00:37:14.148,00:37:16.817,We were a... large family for a while.
00:37:22.323,00:37:23.324,I'm sorry.
00:37:24.033,00:37:25.034,"No, it's, uh..."
00:37:27.620,00:37:29.789,We moved back here right after I was born.
00:37:35.461,00:37:37.421,That's what he used to call us.
00:37:38.256,00:37:40.800,He took me back there recently. Alberta.
00:37:42.343,00:37:43.761,He wanted to see it again.
00:37:45.596,00:37:46.806,It's beautiful.
00:37:48.099,00:37:51.936,"In school, back when we were acquainted..."
00:37:52.979,00:37:57.275,"John talked of big cities, of other parts of the world."
00:37:57.358,00:37:58.859,It seemed...
00:38:00.027,00:38:01.070,impossible.
00:38:03.864,00:38:04.907,Sounds good to me.
00:38:07.034,00:38:09.287,You resemble him in many ways.
00:38:15.209,00:38:17.962,There was nothing he could say to talk me into leaving.
00:38:19.630,00:38:20.756,I wish...
00:38:21.924,00:38:23.884,He... he asked you to go with him?
00:38:24.802,00:38:28.306,I'll always be grateful to him for thinking I'd be brave enough.
00:38:30.349,00:38:31.684,Obligation...
00:38:33.477,00:38:34.937,can be a prison.
00:38:37.189,00:38:38.649,I've always wondered...
00:38:42.111,00:38:43.696,I'll take my leave.
00:38:44.113,00:38:47.700,Please reach out to us if you need anything at all.
00:38:48.492,00:38:50.870,"Thank you, Miss Cuthbert."
00:39:56.352,00:39:58.229,That is not what I meant.
00:40:17.998,00:40:20.876,"-Hello, Mary Joe. May I come in? -Do you want Diana? She's out."
00:40:23.629,00:40:27.967,"I'm sorry, Miss Barry, but I have a pressing need to ask you something, and you're my designated mentor."
00:40:35.099,00:40:36.475,"-Oh, I'm sorry. -Oh..."
00:40:37.059,00:40:38.686,"It's quite all right, child."
00:40:40.604,00:40:41.605,I should go.
00:40:41.689,00:40:43.566,"No, no."
00:40:50.114,00:40:51.115,Ooh.
00:40:54.076,00:41:02.501,"Emotion is rarely convenient and often intolerable, but I find, at the moment, that I don't mind it."
00:41:03.752,00:41:05.254,I'm sorry.
00:41:06.589,00:41:08.549,Grief is confusing.
00:41:09.258,00:41:11.969,"Grief is the price you pay for love, you see."
00:41:12.052,00:41:14.263,So it's all right.
00:41:16.432,00:41:18.517,I miss my dear Gertrude very much.
00:41:19.101,00:41:20.936,And I loved her with all my heart.
00:41:26.275,00:41:27.651,Yes.
00:41:29.153,00:41:31.155,"I admire you, Miss Josephine."
00:41:32.907,00:41:34.033,You're my role model.
00:41:37.369,00:41:43.250,"I aspire to utilize my intellect fully, and never succumb to frivolities such as romance."
00:41:43.834,00:41:46.045,Then you wouldn't be much like me at all.
00:41:47.254,00:41:49.882,"Well, you and I are not the marrying kind."
00:41:49.965,00:41:53.093,"Ah, but I was, in my way."
00:41:53.928,00:41:57.681,And we had a full and wonderful life together.
00:41:59.934,00:42:02.269,"That's all you really have to decide, Anne."
00:42:02.853,00:42:05.356,To live a life with no regrets.
00:00:17.392,00:00:20.520,Do you suppose it's true that no two snowflakes are alike? I hope so.
00:00:20.603,00:00:22.522,"It's kind of comforting, isn't it?"
00:00:22.605,00:00:28.611,"And the bank manager, who happens to be my uncle, he said that the Cuthberts are poor."
00:00:28.695,00:00:38.121,"I've heard it said that snow is a sign of God's forgiveness, and-- By blanketing the ugly frozen earth, and making it beautiful."
00:00:38.204,00:00:39.664,Anne is poor?
00:00:39.748,00:00:40.957,What do you mean poor?
00:00:41.041,00:00:44.794,Poor as in penniless old fellow with no head for finance.
00:00:47.547,00:00:51.217,"-And I love Christmas. Don't you? -I don't know, but I plan to."
00:00:51.885,00:00:53.720,Did you not have Christmas at the orphanage?
00:00:54.721,00:00:56.431,"There wasn't much to it, really."
00:00:56.514,00:00:59.059,I'm not sure why Father Christmas wasn't able to stop there.
00:00:59.142,00:01:00.477,Maybe the matron scared him off.
00:01:06.691,00:01:08.651,"Josie Pye, you take that back!"
00:01:08.735,00:01:11.279,Why are you upset? It's only true. You're poor.
00:01:13.573,00:01:15.158,"Wait, you didn't know?"
00:01:17.202,00:01:19.162,Do you know if they're going to keep you?
00:01:19.245,00:01:21.289,Keep me?
00:01:23.374,00:01:25.668,Come along. In Excelsis Deo.
00:01:26.503,00:01:28.338,"That's right, children. Come along now."
00:02:12.465,00:02:13.591,Anne?
00:02:17.637,00:02:19.264,Are you sure you're all right?
00:02:19.347,00:02:22.142,-Maybe you should slow down. -I have to get on home.
00:02:22.225,00:02:23.768,"Oh, Diana, it can't be true."
00:02:23.852,00:02:27.021,It isn't. That Josie Pye is just as mean as they make 'em.
00:02:27.105,00:02:29.649,She hadn't any right to tell tales about you.
00:02:29.732,00:02:32.652,My first family. My first home.
00:02:33.403,00:02:36.823,They're not going to send you back. You're in the Bible and everything.
00:02:44.706,00:02:47.917,-You took out a loan against Green Gables? -It had to be done.
00:02:48.001,00:02:50.837,Why did you take such an action without discussing it with me?
00:02:51.421,00:02:52.839,I was trying to protect us.
00:02:52.922,00:02:55.925,Make the best out of a... a bad situation.
00:02:56.968,00:02:59.137,The crop was lost. We didn't have means.
00:02:59.220,00:03:03.016,"Yet another thing you neglected to mention. This is my home, too."
00:03:03.099,00:03:05.810,-And Anne's! -I didn't want to talk about it.
00:03:05.894,00:03:09.898,You didn't trust me? To talk about our future? Anne's future?
00:03:22.702,00:03:24.370,We have the loan. That's done.
00:03:24.454,00:03:27.582,"And with it, I have purchased everything that we need."
00:03:27.665,00:03:29.250,-You've already spent the money? -Yes.
00:03:29.334,00:03:32.337,-Madness! -On high yield crops-- This is madness!
00:03:41.137,00:03:44.140,We'll have a high-yield crop and then another in the fall.
00:03:44.224,00:03:48.311,"So now we have two new crops, in addition to the potatoes."
00:03:48.394,00:03:49.729,"We'll be fine, Marilla."
00:03:49.812,00:03:53.524,"So now, at your age, you're working even harder?"
00:03:53.608,00:03:55.693,"It's just... It's a bit more work, uh, that's all."
00:03:55.777,00:03:57.528,I don't want you doing more.
00:04:52.542,00:04:54.460,He's had an episode of the heart.
00:04:55.003,00:04:57.588,An occurrence of coronary thrombosis.
00:04:57.672,00:05:02.593,"He's extremely lucky it wasn't fatal, but, make no mistake, he's in a dangerous condition."
00:05:03.511,00:05:06.681,-Dangerous? -It's going to take a long time to heal.
00:05:06.764,00:05:11.144,"He's gonna need months of rest, with no stress or work of any kind."
00:05:25.783,00:05:27.493,You should be asleep.
00:05:28.077,00:05:29.412,So should you.
00:05:48.431,00:05:50.099,I wish I had a head for numbers.
00:05:51.017,00:05:54.729,"I'm a dunce at geometry, but I'm pretty good at math now."
00:05:55.688,00:05:57.273,Which part is troublesome?
00:05:59.067,00:06:01.611,Here... and here.
00:06:04.697,00:06:07.200,This is the amount that was borrowed against the bank.
00:06:07.283,00:06:08.951,"Yes, that much I know."
00:06:09.869,00:06:12.163,And this is the rate of interest.
00:06:13.664,00:06:15.208,"Gosh, it's very high."
00:06:21.506,00:06:22.590,Let me see.
00:06:30.223,00:06:32.892,And carry one...
00:06:43.486,00:06:45.696,I'll have to go speak with the bank.
00:06:46.364,00:06:47.657,I need some clarity.
00:06:53.704,00:06:55.456,Even if you're not keeping me.
00:06:57.250,00:06:58.835,Not keeping you?
00:06:59.919,00:07:01.379,You're a Cuthbert.
00:07:01.462,00:07:02.964,For better or for worse.
00:07:03.548,00:07:05.299,No getting out of it now.
00:07:09.887,00:07:11.514,There most certainly is.
00:07:12.265,00:07:16.185,I know for a fact that when one is under stress it's hard to hear what's being said.
00:07:16.936,00:07:20.022,It's as if the person speaking is miles away or under water.
00:07:27.071,00:07:28.823,I'll keep good watch over him.
00:07:28.906,00:07:30.616,"We'll be back, quick as we can."
00:07:51.721,00:07:54.348,This is most irregular.
00:07:54.891,00:07:56.851,Where is Mr. Cuthbert?
00:07:58.436,00:08:00.897,Indisposed. Unfortunately.
00:08:01.898,00:08:03.608,I'm here on his behalf.
00:08:08.488,00:08:10.448,It'll be many months until he is well.
00:08:11.491,00:08:13.534,"Difficult news, indeed."
00:08:13.618,00:08:14.702,Yes.
00:08:16.078,00:08:17.163,I'm...
00:08:17.997,00:08:19.290,We're...
00:08:20.333,00:08:23.169,Matthew and I are wondering about the terms of the loan...
00:08:24.128,00:08:27.089,and if we might get an extension on the payments.
00:08:27.173,00:08:29.634,The terms of the loan are clear.
00:08:29.717,00:08:32.428,Mr. Cuthbert was the asset we invested in.
00:08:32.512,00:08:34.472,That's why I'm hoping to renegotiate.
00:08:35.139,00:08:37.141,In light of the situation?
00:08:37.225,00:08:39.101,It seems you don't understand.
00:08:39.185,00:08:41.354,This loan is now a bad risk.
00:08:42.313,00:08:47.568,I am going to have to exercise this clause here to pull the loan back.
00:08:50.488,00:08:51.781,Pull it back?
00:08:56.244,00:08:58.287,What exactly does that mean?
00:08:59.956,00:09:03.543,I have already stated that Mr. Cuthbert is the asset.
00:09:03.626,00:09:08.130,"If he is not able to work the land, then we must call in the loan by the end of the month."
00:09:08.214,00:09:14.845,"I'm sorry, but if there's no potential for return on our investment, the investment must be returned, or the property forfeit."
00:09:16.389,00:09:17.765,It is all right there.
00:09:25.064,00:09:27.567,"Wait here, please. I have a quick errand to run."
00:10:06.022,00:10:07.523,Adding up the rest...
00:10:09.734,00:10:11.527,"36 letters, total."
00:10:12.528,00:10:15.114,How much is that for the advertisement?
00:10:15.197,00:10:18.242,And how much more would it be for distribution to the mainland?
00:10:25.333,00:10:28.252,"Sit down, sit down. I stoked the fire."
00:10:30.421,00:10:32.882,Matthew is resting well.
00:10:37.261,00:10:38.638,What happened at the bank?
00:10:40.222,00:10:41.724,It's the end of everything.
00:10:43.100,00:10:44.602,We're ruined.
00:10:44.685,00:10:46.771,We're gonna lose the farm.
00:10:46.854,00:10:48.439,Lose Green Gables.
00:10:48.522,00:10:49.815,Can nothing be done?
00:10:50.483,00:10:55.154,"Well, our only hope would be to somehow raise the amount of the loan."
00:10:55.237,00:10:56.238,We have to try.
00:10:56.322,00:10:59.825,Everything of value will have to be sold. Right quick.
00:10:59.909,00:11:01.911,It's a fearful sum.
00:11:02.703,00:11:04.997,I shall rally the troops in town.
00:11:05.081,00:11:07.041,I'm sure folks will want to make a contribution.
00:11:07.124,00:11:11.671,"-No! I will not accept charity. -But-- That's final, Rachel. I won't hear of it."
00:11:11.754,00:11:15.007,The Cuthberts do not and will not take charity.
00:11:21.555,00:11:23.432,The Barrys will buy our cattle.
00:11:29.647,00:11:31.023,Best get it over with.
00:11:59.343,00:12:02.847,"When you see everything together like this, it's quite an array of treasures."
00:12:02.930,00:12:04.515,They're just things.
00:12:05.307,00:12:09.061,Matthew said the pawnbroker in Charlottetown buys all kinds of goods.
00:12:09.145,00:12:10.646,I hope he's right.
00:12:10.729,00:12:14.400,I'm looking forward to seeing Miss Josephine and staying in a guest room.
00:12:15.109,00:12:18.195,Diana says that the manse is ever so elegant.
00:12:20.781,00:12:21.907,"Oh, Marilla..."
00:12:22.992,00:12:25.327,I wish I had something of value to contribute.
00:12:26.871,00:12:27.872,Oh!
00:12:54.648,00:12:56.400,This is a family effort.
00:12:57.693,00:12:58.819,Anne...
00:12:59.778,00:13:00.905,come here.
00:13:07.995,00:13:09.246,Matthew is...
00:13:11.332,00:13:13.417,It's not wise for me to leave.
00:13:13.501,00:13:14.835,I need to be home.
00:13:18.714,00:13:20.132,"I'll go on my own, Marilla."
00:13:20.633,00:13:22.051,I can do it.
00:13:22.134,00:13:25.054,"I'm a veteran voyager, and I'll be back before you know it."
00:13:25.679,00:13:27.890,-Jerry will accompany you. -What?
00:13:27.973,00:13:30.601,"No, I'll be fine on my own. I don't need company."
00:13:33.145,00:13:36.106,But this could be a quintessential hero's journey.
00:13:36.190,00:13:38.275,You're not going alone and that's final.
00:13:38.359,00:13:40.986,"He'll auction the shire, and take his last wages from the sale."
00:13:41.070,00:13:44.865,-But I don't need-- -I'll not hear another word of protest.
00:13:47.117,00:13:50.913,"It makes Marilla feel better to have you along, but I really don't need you to come."
00:13:50.996,00:13:54.333,-I've traveled alone without incident. -You've been lucky.
00:13:56.835,00:13:57.836,I've been smart.
00:13:58.420,00:13:59.922,So then both. Whatever.
00:14:00.005,00:14:03.300,I'd simply like you to acknowledge the fact that I don't actually need your help.
00:14:04.009,00:14:06.011,When's the last time you drove a sleigh?
00:14:06.554,00:14:08.556,Auction a horse? Let's go.
00:14:13.852,00:14:16.063,Diana! W-What are you doing here?
00:14:16.146,00:14:17.356,I'm so glad I caught you.
00:14:17.439,00:14:19.066,I brought you something to sell.
00:14:21.193,00:14:22.570,"Oh, Diana, are you sure?"
00:14:23.070,00:14:24.238,Of course I'm sure.
00:14:26.073,00:14:27.241,Thank you.
00:14:35.875,00:14:37.084,I just came to say goodbye.
00:14:42.172,00:14:43.424,We will.
00:14:43.507,00:14:45.301,Be sure to tell Matthew not to worry.
00:14:48.137,00:14:50.264,Everything will be all right. You'll see.
00:15:03.777,00:15:06.363,"It's not so bad to ask for help sometimes, you know."
00:15:06.447,00:15:08.240,"If I needed help, I would say so."
00:15:08.324,00:15:10.159,"-No, you wouldn't. -Yes, I would."
00:15:10.242,00:15:11.410,-Wouldn't. -Would!
00:15:11.493,00:15:13.704,-Times infinity. -What?
00:15:23.464,00:15:24.757,No singing.
00:15:24.840,00:15:26.216,I mean it.
00:15:27.259,00:15:28.886,"I'm serious, Jerry."
00:15:28.969,00:15:31.138,This is an important journey.
00:15:32.306,00:15:34.725,I will kill you with my bare hands!
00:15:57.456,00:15:59.083,I see you've been here before.
00:15:59.166,00:16:00.793,Only in my dreams.
00:16:00.876,00:16:02.586,"Well, how may I help you today?"
00:16:02.670,00:16:06.799,-I am here to return a dress. -Is something wrong with it?
00:16:07.383,00:16:08.550,Not a thing.
00:16:08.634,00:16:10.010,Do you not like it?
00:16:10.094,00:16:14.515,It is my very favorite thing that I have ever possessed in life.
00:16:15.099,00:16:17.643,But I need to return it to help my family.
00:16:19.228,00:16:21.480,You're Anne. Matthew's Anne.
00:16:21.563,00:16:24.400,I am. How nice it is to hear it said that way.
00:16:24.483,00:16:27.403,"What happened, dear? Why do the Cuthberts need help?"
00:17:08.193,00:17:10.779,Did Matthew really spend this much?
00:17:10.863,00:17:12.281,You're worth a lot to him.
00:17:13.532,00:17:17.119,-Put it in here for safekeeping. -Thank you.
00:17:25.627,00:17:30.549,"He telleth the number of the stars, and calleth them all by their names."
00:17:40.684,00:17:43.562,-It's all right. -I'll meet you back here after. Yes?
00:17:44.354,00:17:45.647,I hate to say goodbye.
00:17:45.731,00:17:47.357,I won't be so long.
00:17:49.693,00:17:51.487,Why are you so annoying?
00:17:53.697,00:17:55.324,"You're a good horse, Burty."
00:17:55.908,00:17:57.451,Try to remember that.
00:17:58.285,00:18:01.413,Somebody will be very lucky to have you.
00:18:02.581,00:18:03.791,You'll be fine.
00:18:20.057,00:18:22.309,"So, you've been entrusted, eh?"
00:18:24.436,00:18:26.563,"All righty, Old Enough."
00:18:26.647,00:18:28.065,Let's see what's what.
00:18:31.151,00:18:35.405,"Ain't much I ain't got, so... I can't say as I'll be too interested."
00:18:35.489,00:18:37.282,That's understandable.
00:18:37.366,00:18:40.244,If these were ordinary items. But they're not.
00:18:40.327,00:18:41.787,Never heard that before.
00:18:47.876,00:18:49.545,Nope. Dime a dozen.
00:18:49.628,00:18:53.257,I doubt it. My parents were given that as a gift when in service of the Queen.
00:18:54.466,00:18:57.886,It was made by the royal potter. Don't you recognize the stamp?
00:18:57.970,00:19:01.056,The Queen was indebted to them for the intelligence they brought during the Boer War.
00:19:01.140,00:19:04.560,-That's all I'm at liberty to say. -Intelligence? Meaning what?
00:19:04.643,00:19:06.353,Espionage.
00:19:06.436,00:19:08.564,-Meaning what? -Spying.
00:19:08.647,00:19:12.192,"For the crown. I'm sorry, that's all I can reveal."
00:19:12.276,00:19:13.443,What a crock!
00:19:16.071,00:19:17.114,Amethyst.
00:19:18.740,00:19:21.660,-Don't care. -That is a very special brooch.
00:19:21.743,00:19:22.578,Hmm.
00:19:22.661,00:19:23.704,Not to me.
00:19:23.787,00:19:27.082,-It's been in our family for generations. -So keep it.
00:19:31.003,00:19:33.839,"Look, maybe I can give you a small sum for it."
00:19:33.922,00:19:35.090,To be nice.
00:19:36.341,00:19:37.801,Maybe.
00:19:37.885,00:19:39.386,Let's see what else you got.
00:19:43.223,00:19:45.809,"Oh, I'm sorry. Those letters aren't for sale."
00:19:45.893,00:19:47.269,Letters? Don't want 'em.
00:19:47.352,00:19:50.856,I'm keeping all this correspondence from the tsar for posterity.
00:19:50.939,00:19:54.902,-They shouldn't have been packed. -What a piece of work you are. The tsar?
00:19:54.985,00:19:58.238,Alexander had an inclination towards mysticism.
00:19:58.322,00:20:01.992,And he found my great-grandmother fascinating. She had psychic abilities.
00:20:02.075,00:20:03.577,I'll never part with them.
00:20:03.660,00:20:11.418,But I am willing to let the Queen Victoria vanity set go and a few other precious items.
00:20:11.501,00:20:13.378,There's only so much one has room for.
00:20:13.462,00:20:18.050,"We're, uh, moving back to the manse in England soon, and there's too much to travel with."
00:20:18.133,00:20:27.559,"The house there is so full of treasures. I shouldn't have told you so much, after we went to all this trouble to dress me in a humble fashion so as to avoid interest from highwaymen."
00:20:30.145,00:20:33.690,-So who's this from? Queenie or Russki? -Neither.
00:20:33.774,00:20:37.778,"No, that I believe belonged to Prince Albert."
00:20:38.737,00:20:41.323,"If you can't afford it, I completely understand."
00:20:47.287,00:20:50.999,"Ladies, how is every little thing?"
00:20:51.083,00:20:53.919,"Oh, let's just move that a little to the left."
00:20:54.836,00:20:55.671,A little more.
00:20:56.630,00:20:58.090,Mm. A little more.
00:20:59.883,00:21:01.009,Good.
00:21:01.677,00:21:03.345,Pronouncement.
00:21:03.428,00:21:09.226,We will be passing the hat at the recital for those who have lost their income when the Dal Marie went down.
00:21:10.602,00:21:12.980,The Cuthberts were hit particular hard.
00:21:13.814,00:21:15.565,I don't really know them. Do you?
00:21:21.571,00:21:25.701,for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
00:21:27.327,00:21:30.998,"In the spirit of Christmas, I know everyone will be moved to generosity."
00:21:45.012,00:21:46.179,Thank you.
00:22:54.831,00:22:56.792,I think I need to sit down. I...
00:22:57.542,00:22:58.668,Sure.
00:23:01.713,00:23:06.009,It's a means to an end. I hope to get hired on a steamer soon.
00:23:07.177,00:23:09.763,"May I ask, what about your farm?"
00:23:09.846,00:23:13.391,I don't have to decide right now. I want to see some of the world first.
00:23:14.726,00:23:16.353,If I come back to Avonlea...
00:23:17.687,00:23:21.525,"I want it to be my choice, not an obligation."
00:23:21.608,00:23:23.360,It's what my dad would have wanted.
00:23:24.820,00:23:28.240,Sorry to hear about Mr. Cuthbert taking sick and all those troubles.
00:23:31.743,00:23:35.163,Even though I just sold all our... Everything.
00:23:36.248,00:23:38.208,-But thank you. -He's a good man.
00:23:38.291,00:23:40.752,He offered to help me with my land come spring.
00:23:40.836,00:23:42.212,I love him with all my heart.
00:23:42.295,00:23:44.506,I don't know what I'd do if...
00:23:49.261,00:23:51.429,"-I owe you an apology. -No, you don't."
00:23:51.513,00:23:53.932,"-Yes, I do. -I should apologize to you."
00:23:55.225,00:23:58.186,-But it was my fault. -Can we please not argue for once?
00:23:58.270,00:23:59.813,Can you stop contradicting me?
00:24:01.857,00:24:10.365,"Gilbert... I am very sorry that I wasn't more sensitive about your father, and what losing him really meant for you."
00:24:12.534,00:24:14.286,It's water under the bridge.
00:24:14.369,00:24:17.330,I know so much more now than I did then.
00:24:22.586,00:24:23.837,Anyway.
00:24:26.423,00:24:29.551,I should... I should go. Work.
00:24:38.935,00:24:40.854,This one looks perfect.
00:24:40.937,00:24:43.648,Green Gables in Avonlea.
00:24:44.900,00:24:45.942,Nice.
00:24:50.864,00:24:52.115,I've missed you.
00:24:54.451,00:24:56.912,At school. There's no one to compete with.
00:24:56.995,00:25:00.248,You want to spell out a few words for old time's sake?
00:25:01.124,00:25:04.419,How about... truce?
00:25:05.629,00:25:08.548,T-R-U-C-E.
00:25:09.799,00:25:12.219,-Moody would've gotten that wrong. -He would've!
00:25:14.346,00:25:17.557,"-Get away from her! -Stop, Jerry! Stop! Stop! I-I-I know him."
00:25:19.851,00:25:22.479,"Jerry, what happened to you? Are you all right?"
00:25:26.441,00:25:27.734,Sit down.
00:25:29.819,00:25:32.155,Okay. What happened?
00:25:32.239,00:25:35.075,I'm so sorry. They took it.
00:25:41.081,00:25:42.332,Don't turn around.
00:25:45.502,00:25:48.421,-So sorry. -We need to get you to Miss Barry's.
00:25:49.089,00:25:50.548,I don't like the city.
00:25:53.802,00:25:56.096,I remember you now from the big fire.
00:25:56.846,00:25:57.847,I-I'm Jerry.
00:25:58.473,00:25:59.516,Gilbert.
00:26:01.977,00:26:04.312,Need my help with anything? Anything I can do?
00:26:04.396,00:26:05.939,Just take care of yourself.
00:26:06.856,00:26:08.066,Come home someday.
00:26:08.149,00:26:09.067,Yeah.
00:26:09.150,00:26:11.444,"-Hope everything works out. -For you, too."
00:26:18.451,00:26:19.995,Au revoir.
00:26:21.871,00:26:24.582,"Uh, yes. Bye."
00:26:24.666,00:26:25.792,Bye.
00:26:42.309,00:26:44.144,So you sold everything?
00:26:44.894,00:26:46.062,Yes.
00:26:58.491,00:27:00.660,"This is a palace, not a house."
00:27:00.744,00:27:02.829,You sure this is the right place?
00:27:16.676,00:27:19.262,-Is she at home? -Who shall I say is calling?
00:27:19.346,00:27:20.472,Anne of Green Gables.
00:27:20.555,00:27:23.183,"For heaven's sake, Rollings, these are my guests!"
00:27:23.266,00:27:25.477,Come in. Come in. Come in from the cold.
00:27:25.560,00:27:27.562,I was beginning to think you weren't coming.
00:27:27.645,00:27:31.566,"Oh, my dear Anne, it's very good to see you. Ah..."
00:27:32.609,00:27:34.694,Dear me! Whatever has happened to you?
00:27:35.403,00:27:37.489,"-Rollings, take poor, um... -Uh, Jerry."
00:27:37.572,00:27:41.493,"...Jerry, here, downstairs. We'll get you cleaned up and sorted."
00:27:43.036,00:27:47.082,Thank you. That's very kind. See you in the morning. I'll look after Belle.
00:27:47.165,00:27:48.917,For heaven's sake! There's room at this inn!
00:27:49.000,00:27:50.627,You won't be sleeping in the stable.
00:27:50.710,00:27:52.962,I've guest rooms prepared for each of you.
00:27:53.046,00:27:57.342,"So run along and wash up, then join us for supper. This way, Anne."
00:28:06.643,00:28:07.644,It has been that.
00:28:08.269,00:28:10.772,"Oh, this city is rife with ruffians."
00:28:10.855,00:28:14.192,It's a wonder anyone can walk down the streets alone anymore.
00:28:15.985,00:28:17.404,Good strong lad.
00:28:17.487,00:28:20.031,"You'll manage things at Green Gables, won't you?"
00:28:26.246,00:28:28.623,What? What have I said?
00:28:31.126,00:28:33.044,We can't keep Jerry on.
00:28:36.339,00:28:39.843,-But how will you run the farm? -We're more concerned with saving it.
00:28:39.926,00:28:42.011,We'll get to that part later.
00:28:42.095,00:28:43.596,You must let me help.
00:28:43.680,00:28:47.308,"Oh, Miss Barry, you're so kind, but unfortunately I can't accept."
00:28:47.392,00:28:51.020,Stuff and nonsense! This is no time to stand on pride.
00:28:51.104,00:28:54.691,"The Cuthberts will not accept charity, and so as a Cuthbert, neither can I."
00:28:55.442,00:28:56.818,Hmm.
00:29:05.326,00:29:07.120,You shouldn't have let her go.
00:29:07.203,00:29:09.122,"Oh, please don't fret so."
00:29:10.290,00:29:12.459,Anne and Jerry will be safe together.
00:29:17.255,00:29:21.509,"You and Anne, you'd be better off if I were gone."
00:29:22.218,00:29:24.554,What? I won't have you talking like this.
00:29:24.637,00:29:28.933,My life insurance will hold you both in good stead.
00:29:29.017,00:29:30.518,I won't hear it.
00:29:31.895,00:29:33.563,It's what I wish for.
00:29:34.147,00:29:35.356,Why would you wish that?
00:29:36.649,00:29:38.526,You mustn't think such thoughts.
00:29:39.444,00:29:41.863,-We need you here. -No.
00:29:42.447,00:29:44.073,Anne loves you.
00:29:44.616,00:29:46.326,You have to remember that.
00:29:46.409,00:29:48.828,But... her future.
00:29:48.912,00:29:50.955,Which do you think she would choose?
00:29:52.081,00:29:55.335,This house... or you?
00:29:55.418,00:29:57.921,Now stop this morbid foolishness.
00:30:23.404,00:30:25.448,Anne? Anne!
00:30:28.576,00:30:30.078,Can I sleep here?
00:30:32.038,00:30:33.414,W-Why? What's wrong?
00:30:34.999,00:30:36.000,I never...
00:30:36.084,00:30:38.086,"At home, I don't have my own bed."
00:30:45.301,00:30:46.803,What are you doing?
00:30:48.847,00:30:50.974,"There's so many of us, this is how we sleep."
00:30:51.891,00:30:53.935,"Don't worry, I don't kick my sisters."
00:30:54.561,00:30:55.937,You'd better not.
00:31:05.947,00:31:07.407,Everything will be all right.
00:31:09.742,00:31:11.035,It'll be all right.
00:31:18.960,00:31:20.879,Merci beaucoup. The food was amazing.
00:31:22.505,00:31:25.091,Books also provide ports in the storm.
00:31:27.844,00:31:30.763,George Eliot. I don't know him.
00:31:30.847,00:31:33.558,He is a her. Mary Ann Evans.
00:31:33.641,00:31:35.018,How wonderful.
00:31:35.977,00:31:37.395,A nom de plume.
00:31:37.478,00:31:40.398,"If you do write a book someday, I pray you won't need one."
00:31:41.316,00:31:43.610,"-Thank you. -Oh, not at all. Not at all."
00:31:47.238,00:31:48.573,Rollings...
00:31:48.656,00:31:50.033,Madam.
00:31:50.116,00:31:52.035,"Jerry, I have something for you, too."
00:31:52.118,00:31:55.121,"You're going to stay on at Green Gables, and I'm going to pay for it."
00:31:55.204,00:31:58.416,"-Oh, Miss Barry, I've already-- -This is a business arrangement."
00:31:59.000,00:32:03.630,"I am offering you a job, at fair wages, that happens to be at Green Gables."
00:32:04.714,00:32:06.257,Do you accept?
00:32:09.260,00:32:11.304,Oui. I do. Merci.
00:32:12.555,00:32:13.556,Good lad.
00:32:14.641,00:32:17.977,"I'll be outside for a bit, tending to the livestock."
00:32:24.317,00:32:27.028,I hope you've let go of that fool notion of last night.
00:32:28.154,00:32:30.031,We've been together all these years.
00:32:30.531,00:32:31.658,Thick or thin.
00:32:32.158,00:32:34.869,So don't think I'll put up with you slipping away now.
00:32:35.787,00:32:40.959,"Anne will be home today, and she'll be very happy to see you."
00:35:07.563,00:35:08.981,Jeannie.
00:35:17.073,00:35:19.450,"Jeannie, help me get him to bed."
00:35:24.997,00:35:28.876,And I couldn't have found your Anne more delightful if I tried.
00:35:28.960,00:35:30.294,I didn't know she sold it.
00:35:30.920,00:35:32.880,It made her so very happy to help.
00:35:33.381,00:35:35.216,I don't want her suffering...
00:35:35.842,00:35:37.301,because of me.
00:35:37.385,00:35:40.721,Do you think she'd ever recover from losing you this way?
00:35:44.809,00:35:49.230,"Matthew, you know too well the impact of an untimely death."
00:35:52.191,00:35:54.277,Anne has suffered so much loss.
00:35:56.028,00:35:57.697,She finally belongs.
00:35:58.823,00:35:59.949,Here.
00:36:00.741,00:36:01.868,With you.
00:36:16.841,00:36:18.509,Don't ever get old.
00:36:19.051,00:36:20.386,Too late for that.
00:36:26.392,00:36:27.602,I'll be on my way.
00:36:34.859,00:36:36.068,Take care.
00:37:12.021,00:37:13.940,How could you even think it?
00:37:15.650,00:37:19.195,You would have left us that way? Left me?
00:37:20.738,00:37:23.199,"Uh, the thought o-of being..."
00:37:26.077,00:37:27.286,I couldn't...
00:37:28.663,00:37:29.997,But I won't leave you.
00:37:31.249,00:37:32.750,I won't leave you and Anne.
00:37:34.585,00:37:35.836,Would you forgive me?
00:37:40.716,00:37:41.884,Forgive me.
00:37:58.192,00:38:00.861,"You are a sight for sore eyes, Mr. Cuthbert."
00:38:02.196,00:38:03.197,Mm.
00:38:20.006,00:38:21.841,This is from Josephine Barry.
00:38:24.760,00:38:27.263,Give it back. I won't take charity.
00:38:27.346,00:38:29.598,But... love isn't charity.
00:38:29.682,00:38:30.975,I won't take it.
00:38:32.351,00:38:34.645,-May I ask why not? -We will not be pitied!
00:38:38.774,00:38:40.776,"Well, at the moment, we can't."
00:38:40.860,00:38:45.865,And I'd sure give my last bit of strength or my last dollar to help a friend.
00:38:45.948,00:38:50.161,And I know that friend would feel grateful and loved above all else.
00:38:50.786,00:38:52.038,And I do.
00:38:52.872,00:38:56.292,I feel very grateful to have such a dear friend as Miss Barry.
00:38:58.794,00:39:03.424,"Sometimes, you just have to let people love you, Marilla."
00:39:07.345,00:39:08.679,You're quite right.
00:39:12.516,00:39:18.147,"Even adding this, and even with the cattle I sold, it's still a ways from enough."
00:39:18.898,00:39:21.192,-We still have a little more time. -A little.
00:39:21.692,00:39:23.778,-Very little. -Plenty.
00:39:23.861,00:39:26.155,There are still three weeks until the end of December.
00:39:26.238,00:39:28.032,Three weeks?
00:39:28.115,00:39:31.369,We could... sell off some farm equipment.
00:39:31.452,00:39:32.745,If we're lucky.
00:39:34.789,00:39:36.332,I know what else I can sell.
00:39:41.337,00:39:45.674,"Good day. My name is Anne Shirley-Cuthbert, and I'd like to offer you my services."
00:39:45.758,00:39:49.637,"For a small wage, I can give your home a thorough cleaning before the holidays."
00:39:49.720,00:39:51.514,I have all my own supplies.
00:39:53.682,00:39:56.435,"I can sweep, dust and scrub floors."
00:40:24.422,00:40:26.132,through many of our years...
00:40:27.258,00:40:33.389,the idea that we could accept any exchange for it seems to be a cheapening of our lives.
00:40:33.973,00:40:38.310,And we can set a watch over our affections and our constancy...
00:40:39.019,00:40:41.939,as we can over other treasures.
00:40:49.780,00:40:51.991,"We're rich, aren't we, Matthew?"
00:40:52.074,00:40:54.326,"Well, now, I suppose we are."
00:41:08.090,00:41:10.426,"Anne, Matthew."
00:41:11.051,00:41:13.596,"Jerry, here, has something for us."
00:41:15.306,00:41:16.640,Joyeux Noël.
00:41:35.576,00:41:37.912,"We have some happy news, Anne."
00:41:39.246,00:41:41.999,I put a notice in the paper to take in boarders.
00:41:42.583,00:41:43.667,We have two confirmed.
00:41:44.251,00:41:53.177,"Now that we have a sizeable portion of what we owe, and we'll have steady income, I'll pay a visit to the bank right after the holidays to see about the terms."
00:42:30.297,00:42:35.219,"I'm excited to have a whole new year in front of us, just bursting with possibility."
00:42:36.512,00:42:38.889,"The last one was quite an adventure, wasn't it?"
00:42:49.942,00:42:53.404,Mmm. What a bounty. You ladies have outdone yourselves.
00:42:53.487,00:42:55.573,"It's simple fare, but thank you."
00:42:55.656,00:42:58.367,I wonder what's happened to that other fellow you were expecting.
00:43:00.119,00:43:01.620,That must be him.
00:43:03.414,00:43:04.456,I'll get it.
00:43:15.801,00:43:17.803,Please tell me this is Green Gables.
