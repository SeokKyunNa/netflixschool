00:01:48.233,00:01:52.821,"A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness."
00:01:52.904,00:01:54.864,-It is almost here. -What is it?
00:01:54.948,00:01:56.282,What if it's the Demogorgon?
00:01:56.366,00:01:59.410,"Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon."
00:01:59.494,00:02:00.537,It's not the Demogorgon.
00:02:00.620,00:02:02.872,An army of troglodytes charge into the chamber!
00:02:10.630,00:02:12.590,Did you hear that?
00:02:12.674,00:02:14.092,That... that sound?
00:02:14.175,00:02:16.845,Boom... boom...
00:02:18.763,00:02:20.640,"That didn't come from the troglodytes. No, that..."
00:02:20.723,00:02:22.392,That came from something else.
00:02:26.938,00:02:28.398,"-We're in deep shit. -Will, your action!"
00:02:28.481,00:02:29.774,-I don't know! -Fireball him!
00:02:29.858,00:02:31.151,I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!
00:02:31.234,00:02:33.069,Too risky. Cast a protection spell.
00:02:33.153,00:02:35.697,-Don't be a pussy. Fireball him! -Cast Protection.
00:02:35.780,00:02:38.491,The Demogorgon is tired of your silly human bickering!
00:02:38.575,00:02:40.368,It stomps towards you.
00:02:40.451,00:02:41.452,-Boom! -Fireball him!
00:02:41.536,00:02:43.830,"-Another stomp, boom! -Cast Protection."
00:03:00.555,00:03:02.348,"Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!"
00:03:02.432,00:03:04.559,You mean the end? Fifteen after.
00:03:07.937,00:03:10.607,"-Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes! -It's a school night, Michael."
00:03:10.690,00:03:13.151,I just put Holly to bed. You can finish next weekend.
00:03:13.234,00:03:16.112,"-But that'll ruin the flow! -Michael-- I'm serious, Mom."
00:03:16.195,00:03:18.656,The campaign took two weeks to plan.
00:03:18.740,00:03:20.658,How was I supposed to know it was gonna take ten hours?
00:03:20.742,00:03:22.619,You've been playing for ten hours?
00:03:23.953,00:03:27.749,"-Dad, don't you think that 20 more-- -I think you should listen to your mother."
00:03:34.380,00:03:36.257,-Does the seven count? -It was a seven?
00:03:36.925,00:03:39.469,Did Mike see it? Then it doesn't count.
00:03:52.649,00:03:54.234,"No, I don't think..."
00:03:55.360,00:03:56.945,"Yeah, he's cute."
00:03:57.028,00:04:00.365,"Barb, no, I don't think so."
00:04:00.448,00:04:01.908,"-Barb, you're not-- -Hey, Nancy."
00:04:02.784,00:04:04.160,There's a slice left if you want it.
00:04:04.244,00:04:06.579,-Sausage and pepperoni! -Hold on.
00:04:13.461,00:04:17.382,-There's something wrong with your sister. -What are you talking about?
00:04:19.342,00:04:21.844,"It's because she's been dating that douchebag, Steve Harrington."
00:04:23.763,00:04:25.098,She's always been a real jerk.
00:04:25.181,00:04:27.058,"Nuh-uh, she used to be cool."
00:04:27.141,00:04:29.519,Like that time she dressed up as an elf for our Elder tree campaign.
00:04:33.940,00:04:35.984,-It was a seven. -Huh?
00:04:36.067,00:04:37.819,"The roll, it was a seven."
00:04:38.903,00:04:41.114,"The Demogorgon, it got me."
00:05:04.178,00:05:06.264,Race you back to my place? Winner gets a comic.
00:05:06.347,00:05:08.016,-Any comic? -Yeah.
00:05:11.102,00:05:13.062,I didn't say go!
00:05:15.106,00:05:17.150,Get back here!
00:05:17.233,00:05:19.360,I'm gonna kill you!
00:05:28.161,00:05:29.704,Son of a bitch.
00:06:28.763,00:06:30.139,Mom?
00:09:32.488,00:09:33.823,Thanks for joining us.
00:09:33.906,00:09:36.200,Let's hand off now to Liz at the news desk.
00:09:37.785,00:09:42.373,"Turning now to local news, we're getting reports of surges and power outages all across the county."
00:09:42.456,00:09:47.878,"Last night, hundreds of homes in East Hawkins were affected, leaving many residents in the dark."
00:09:47.962,00:09:50.089,The cause of the outage is still unknown.
00:09:50.172,00:09:59.307,"We reached out to Roane County Water and Electric, and a spokesperson says that they are confident power will be restored to all remaining homes within the next several hours."
00:10:25.875,00:10:27.043,Mmm.
00:10:58.491,00:11:02.078,"In other news, you might wanna stay home tonight or at least pack an umbrella."
00:11:02.161,00:11:04.580,"We turn to everybody's favorite morning weather guy, Charles."
00:11:11.170,00:11:13.589,-Jonathan? -Check the couch!
00:11:13.672,00:11:14.799,"Ugh, I did."
00:11:15.925,00:11:18.386,Oh... Got them.
00:11:19.512,00:11:21.847,"Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight."
00:11:21.931,00:11:23.766,"-Yeah, see you later. -Where's Will?"
00:11:23.849,00:11:24.934,"Oh, I didn't get him up yet."
00:11:26.227,00:11:29.355,"-Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up! -Mom, I'm making breakfast."
00:11:29.438,00:11:31.273,I told you this a thousand times.
00:11:31.357,00:11:34.985,"Will! Come on, honey. It's time to get up."
00:11:38.364,00:11:41.742,"-He came home last night, right? -He's not in his room?"
00:11:41.826,00:11:44.120,-Did he come home or not? -I don't know.
00:11:44.203,00:11:45.454,-You don't know? -No.
00:11:47.665,00:11:48.707,You were working?
00:11:48.791,00:11:50.709,Eric asked if I could cover. I said yeah.
00:11:50.793,00:11:52.253,I just thought we could use the extra cash.
00:11:52.336,00:11:55.047,"-Jonathan, we've talked about this. -I know, I know."
00:11:55.131,00:11:57.049,You can't take shifts when I'm working.
00:11:57.133,00:11:59.301,"Mom, it's not a big deal. Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day."
00:12:02.138,00:12:04.723,I can't believe you sometimes.
00:12:13.649,00:12:15.401,"Hi, Karen. It's Joyce."
00:12:18.863,00:12:20.573,-Language. -Are you kidding?
00:12:20.656,00:12:22.032,Was that Will I heard back there?
00:12:22.116,00:12:23.617,"Will? No, no, no, it's just Mike."
00:12:23.701,00:12:25.119,Will didn't spend the night?
00:12:27.705,00:12:29.039,Why? He's not home?
00:12:29.123,00:12:32.960,"Um, you know what? I think he just left early for... for school."
00:12:33.043,00:12:35.045,-Thank you so much. Bye. -Okay. Bye.
00:12:57.109,00:12:59.904,That's weird. I don't see him.
00:13:01.614,00:13:03.449,He probably just went to class early again.
00:13:03.532,00:13:06.035,"Yeah, he's always paranoid Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz."
00:13:06.118,00:13:08.037,"Step right up, ladies and gentlemen."
00:13:08.871,00:13:11.373,Step right up and get your tickets for the freak show.
00:13:11.457,00:13:14.084,Who do you think would make more money in a freak show?
00:13:15.836,00:13:19.757,"Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?"
00:13:25.429,00:13:28.891,"I told you a million times, my teeth are coming in."
00:13:28.974,00:13:30.726,It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.
00:13:35.731,00:13:37.066,"Do it, freak!"
00:13:49.912,00:13:52.081,It's like you have superpowers or something.
00:13:52.164,00:13:54.041,Like Mr. Fantastic.
00:14:06.595,00:14:09.139,Keep your voice down.
00:14:09.223,00:14:10.808,Did he?
00:14:10.891,00:14:12.643,"I told you, it's not like that."
00:14:13.227,00:14:16.981,"Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me, but not like that."
00:14:17.690,00:14:18.983,We just...
00:14:20.109,00:14:21.610,made out a couple times.
00:14:21.694,00:14:25.072,We just... made out a couple times.
00:14:25.155,00:14:28.659,"Nance, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous."
00:14:28.742,00:14:30.160,"No, I'm not."
00:14:30.244,00:14:33.914,"You better still hang out with me, that's all I'm saying."
00:14:33.998,00:14:38.168,"If you become friends with Tommy H. or Carol-- Oh, that's gross!"
00:14:38.252,00:14:40.421,"Okay, I'm telling you, it was a one-time..."
00:14:48.178,00:14:49.471,You were saying?
00:14:59.899,00:15:01.358,-Steve... -Mmm-hmm?
00:15:01.442,00:15:03.110,-I have to go. -In a minute.
00:15:04.570,00:15:06.864,"Steve. I really, like..."
00:15:06.947,00:15:08.782,"Seriously, I have to go."
00:15:08.866,00:15:10.242,"Wait, wait, wait. Let's..."
00:15:10.326,00:15:12.202,"Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?"
00:15:12.286,00:15:15.205,"Uh... No, I can't. I have to study for Kaminsky's test."
00:15:15.289,00:15:17.541,"Oh, come on. What's your GPA again? 3.999..."
00:15:17.625,00:15:19.335,Kaminsky's tests are impossible.
00:15:19.418,00:15:21.587,"-Well, then, just let me help. -You failed chem."
00:15:21.670,00:15:23.672,"-C-minus. -Well, in that case..."
00:15:23.756,00:15:26.091,"So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?"
00:15:26.175,00:15:29.136,-Are you crazy? My mom would not-- -I'll climb through your window.
00:15:29.219,00:15:31.388,"She won't even know I'm there. I'm stealthy, like a ninja."
00:15:31.472,00:15:32.723,You are crazy.
00:15:32.806,00:15:34.642,"Wait, wait, wait. Just... Okay, forget about that."
00:15:34.725,00:15:36.018,We can just...
00:15:36.101,00:15:38.020,"We can just, like, chill in my car."
00:15:38.103,00:15:41.065,"We can find a nice quiet place to park, and..."
00:15:41.148,00:15:44.568,Steve... I have to study.
00:15:44.652,00:15:46.362,I'm not kidding.
00:15:46.445,00:15:48.739,"Well, why do you think I want it to be nice and quiet?"
00:15:50.616,00:15:52.493,"You're an idiot, Steve Harrington."
00:15:58.457,00:16:01.043,Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.
00:16:01.877,00:16:03.253,To study.
00:16:16.475,00:16:17.768,Good of you to show.
00:16:21.605,00:16:25.275,"-Hey, Chief. -Damn! You look like hell, Chief."
00:16:26.443,00:16:28.988,"Well, I looked better than your wife when I left her this morning."
00:16:30.155,00:16:35.828,"While you were drinking or sleeping, or whatever it is you deemed so necessary on Monday morning, Phil Larson called."
00:16:35.911,00:16:38.580,Said some kids are stealing the gnomes out of his garden again.
00:16:38.664,00:16:40.124,"Oh, those garden gnomes again."
00:16:40.207,00:16:42.459,"Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna get right on that."
00:16:42.543,00:16:46.213,"On a more pressing matter, Joyce Byers can't find her son this morning."
00:16:49.133,00:16:51.343,-Just give me a minute. -Joyce is very upset.
00:16:51.427,00:16:53.303,"Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this."
00:16:53.387,00:16:55.723,Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.
00:16:55.806,00:16:59.685,"-Chief, she's already in your-- -Coffee and contemplation, Flo!"
00:17:10.154,00:17:12.948,"I have been waiting here over an hour, Hopper."
00:17:15.701,00:17:17.077,I'm going out of my mind!
00:17:17.161,00:17:20.748,"Look, boy his age, he's probably just playing hookie, okay?"
00:17:20.831,00:17:22.833,"No, not my Will. He's not like that."
00:17:22.916,00:17:24.460,"-He wouldn't do that. -Well, you never know."
00:17:24.543,00:17:29.673,"I mean, my mom thought I was on the debate team, when really I was just screwing Chrissy Carpenter in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so..."
00:17:29.757,00:17:32.718,"Look, he's not like you, Hopper. He's not like me."
00:17:32.801,00:17:35.304,He's not like... most.
00:17:35.387,00:17:39.266,"He has a couple of friends, but, you know, the kids, they're mean."
00:17:39.349,00:17:41.185,They make fun of him. They call him names.
00:17:41.268,00:17:43.312,"-They laugh at him, his clothes-- -His clothes?"
00:17:43.395,00:17:45.355,-What's wrong with his clothes? -I don't know.
00:17:45.439,00:17:47.733,-Does that matter? -Maybe.
00:17:47.816,00:17:50.861,"Look, he's... He's a sensitive kid."
00:17:56.158,00:18:00.079,-Is he? -He's missing is what he is.
00:18:01.580,00:18:03.957,When was the last time you heard from Lonnie?
00:18:06.085,00:18:10.422,"Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis. That was about a year ago."
00:18:10.506,00:18:13.258,-But he has nothing to do with this. -Why don't you give me his number?
00:18:13.342,00:18:15.219,"You know, Hopper, he has nothing to do with this. Trust me."
00:18:15.302,00:18:20.724,"Joyce, 99 out of 100 times, kid goes missing, the kid is with a parent or relative."
00:18:22.392,00:18:25.729,"-What? -You said, 99 out of 100."
00:18:25.854,00:18:27.856,"-What about the other time, the one? -Joyce."
00:18:27.940,00:18:29.066,The one!
00:18:31.068,00:18:33.987,You wanna know the worst thing that's ever happened here in the four years I've been working here?
00:18:34.071,00:18:35.239,Do you wanna know the worst thing?
00:18:35.322,00:18:40.244,It was when an owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie's head because it thought that her hair was a nest.
00:18:40.327,00:18:42.996,"Okay, fine. I will call Lonnie."
00:18:43.080,00:18:46.834,"He will talk to me before he talks to-- -What, a pig? -A cop!"
00:18:51.004,00:18:52.881,Find him!
00:19:09.356,00:19:12.192,The entire east wing will be evacuated within the hour.
00:19:12.276,00:19:16.113,We've sealed off this area following quarantine protocol.
00:21:07.641,00:21:09.768,She can't have gone far.
00:22:07.701,00:22:09.244,"Hey, I don't know. I don't know."
00:22:43.612,00:22:45.113,Hey!
00:22:45.197,00:22:46.323,Come here!
00:22:47.074,00:22:48.366,"Hey, come here!"
00:22:53.038,00:22:55.082,"You think you can steal from me, boy?"
00:22:57.584,00:22:58.752,What in the hell?
00:23:03.215,00:23:09.221,and answer 12.3 on the difference between an experiment and other forms of science investigation.
00:23:09.304,00:23:13.183,"This will be on the test, which will cover chapters 10 through 12."
00:23:17.979,00:23:19.356,"So, did it come?"
00:23:19.439,00:23:20.816,"Sorry, boys."
00:23:20.899,00:23:22.776,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but..."
00:23:23.985,00:23:24.903,it came.
00:23:28.490,00:23:29.491,Yes!
00:23:29.574,00:23:31.368,The Heathkit ham shack.
00:23:32.994,00:23:35.038,I bet you can talk to New York on this thing.
00:23:35.122,00:23:36.289,Think bigger.
00:23:36.373,00:23:38.375,-California? -Bigger.
00:23:38.458,00:23:39.835,Australia?
00:23:42.462,00:23:45.340,"When Will sees this, he's totally gonna blow his shit."
00:23:45.423,00:23:46.508,Lucas!

00:24:02.899,00:24:05.068,Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?
00:24:07.237,00:24:12.075,"Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow Michael, Lucas and Dustin?"
00:24:17.080,00:24:18.623,"Okay, okay, okay."
00:24:18.707,00:24:21.668,"One at a time, all right? You."
00:24:22.627,00:24:24.379,-You said he takes what? -Mirkwood.
00:24:24.462,00:24:27.048,-Mirkwood? -Yeah.
00:24:27.132,00:24:30.635,-Have you ever heard of Mirkwood? -I have not. That sounds made up to me.
00:24:30.719,00:24:32.512,"No, it's from Lord of the Rings."
00:24:32.596,00:24:35.473,"-Well, The Hobbit. -It doesn't matter."
00:24:39.186,00:24:41.104,-What'd I just say? -Shut up.
00:24:41.188,00:24:44.482,One at a damn time. You.
00:24:44.566,00:24:47.777,"Mirkwood, it's a real road. It's just the name that's made up."
00:24:47.861,00:24:49.237,It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.
00:24:49.321,00:24:51.823,"-Yeah, all right, I think I know that-- -We can show you, if you want."
00:24:51.907,00:24:53.241,I said that I know it!
00:24:53.325,00:24:55.243,-We can help look. -Yeah.
00:24:57.329,00:25:00.457,"No. After school, you are all to go home."
00:25:00.540,00:25:01.750,Immediately.
00:25:01.833,00:25:06.796,"That means no biking around looking for your friend, no investigating, no nonsense."
00:25:06.880,00:25:08.840,This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.
00:25:08.924,00:25:11.718,-The Hobbit. -Shut up!
00:25:21.603,00:25:26.149,Do I make myself... clear?
00:25:40.789,00:25:42.499,Ring-a-ding-ding!
00:25:42.582,00:25:44.292,Anybody home?
00:25:46.086,00:25:48.046,"Uh, Rada..."
00:25:57.931,00:25:59.557,"So, guess what?"
00:25:59.641,00:26:02.102,I got off early and...
00:26:02.185,00:26:04.854,Ta-da! Poltergeist.
00:26:04.938,00:26:06.481,I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.
00:26:06.564,00:26:07.941,I changed my mind.
00:26:08.984,00:26:10.819,As long as you don't have nightmares for a week.
00:26:10.902,00:26:13.405,"No, I won't. I don't get scared like that anymore."
00:26:13.488,00:26:14.489,"Oh, yeah?"
00:26:14.572,00:26:16.241,Not even of clowns?
00:26:16.324,00:26:17.409,No.
00:26:17.492,00:26:19.869,What about my witch?
00:26:19.953,00:26:21.371,-No. Mom... -Ooh...
00:26:21.454,00:26:23.290,-I'm not five anymore. -But Will Byers...
00:26:23.373,00:26:25.834,-I'm going to cook you up in my-- -Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!
00:26:34.509,00:26:35.760,Will?
00:26:38.722,00:26:40.307,-Will? -Will!
00:26:44.811,00:26:46.479,Where are you?
00:26:55.864,00:26:57.073,Geez.
00:26:57.949,00:26:59.701,Your parents forget to feed you?
00:27:03.371,00:27:05.206,Is that why you ran away?
00:27:08.668,00:27:09.878,"They, uh..."
00:27:10.879,00:27:12.047,They hurt you?
00:27:14.924,00:27:18.386,"You went to the hospital, you got scared, you ran off, you wound up here, is that it?"
00:27:21.431,00:27:22.640,All right.
00:27:24.476,00:27:27.854,"I'll give this back, all right? And you can have as much as you want."
00:27:28.521,00:27:29.939,All right? Maybe even some ice cream.
00:27:30.023,00:27:32.108,"But you gotta answer a few of my questions first, all right?"
00:27:33.568,00:27:35.445,We got a deal?
00:27:37.322,00:27:41.076,"All right, let's start with the easy stuff. All right?"
00:27:41.159,00:27:44.537,My name's Benny. Benny Hammond.
00:27:44.621,00:27:46.331,See? Like this. Here.
00:27:46.414,00:27:49.334,I got you. Don't worry. It's okay.
00:27:49.417,00:27:52.879,"Nice to meet you, yeah. And you are?"
00:28:02.222,00:28:03.264,Eleven?
00:28:04.307,00:28:05.600,What's that mean?
00:28:06.476,00:28:08.228,What's it mean?
00:28:09.312,00:28:11.564,"-No. -Well, I'll be damned."
00:28:11.648,00:28:13.358,She speaks.
00:28:13.441,00:28:15.110,"No? No, what?"
00:28:19.989,00:28:21.157,Eleven.
00:28:22.534,00:28:23.576,Yeah.
00:28:24.911,00:28:26.454,What's it mean?
00:28:28.206,00:28:29.624,Eleven.
00:28:31.334,00:28:33.503,"All right, then."
00:28:35.422,00:28:37.173,"Take it easy, take it easy."
00:28:39.551,00:28:42.178,"Yeah, look, all I know is that she's scared to death."
00:28:42.262,00:28:44.389,"Yeah, I think maybe she's been abused or..."
00:28:44.472,00:28:46.099,kidnapped or something.
00:28:47.600,00:28:50.186,"Yeah, it'd be great if someone would come by."
00:28:50.270,00:28:54.733,"Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane. Yeah, Randolph."
00:29:34.063,00:29:36.065,"Come on, kid!"
00:29:49.370,00:29:52.290,"-That his bike? -Yeah, he must have crashed."
00:29:56.085,00:29:57.629,Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.
00:29:57.712,00:29:59.631,Bike like this is like a Cadillac to these kids.
00:29:59.714,00:30:01.341,He would've walked it home.
00:30:32.664,00:30:34.541,"-I told you, Lonnie's not here. -Who is this?"
00:30:34.624,00:30:36.626,"-His girlfriend, Cynthia. -Cynthia."
00:30:36.709,00:30:39.420,"-Who the hell is this? -Cynthia, this is Joyce."
00:30:39.504,00:30:41.256,-Who? -Lonnie's ex-wife.
00:30:41.339,00:30:43.383,-I really need to speak to him-- -Lonnie's not here.
00:30:43.466,00:30:45.343,-Can you please put-- No! -Why don't you call back later?
00:30:45.426,00:30:46.636,"No, not later. Now!"
00:30:49.472,00:30:51.933,-What? -You have to stay calm.
00:31:01.818,00:31:04.028,Leave a message and I'll holler right back at ya.
00:31:04.112,00:31:07.866,"Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me."
00:31:07.949,00:31:10.451,Will is... is missing. I don't know where he is.
00:31:11.786,00:31:21.629,"I just need you to call me back, please, just-- What?"
00:31:23.673,00:31:24.841,Cops.
00:31:39.689,00:31:43.234,-It was just lying there? -Yeah. Cal?
00:31:44.152,00:31:47.822,"-Did it have any blood on it, or-- -No, no, no, no, no..."
00:31:47.906,00:31:49.407,Phil?
00:31:49.490,00:31:51.910,"If you found the bike out there, why are you here?"
00:31:56.831,00:31:58.249,So...
00:31:59.208,00:32:00.376,maybe he came home.
00:32:02.587,00:32:04.380,I'm not saying that.
00:32:08.134,00:32:10.970,"Probably. I mean, I have two boys. Look at this place."
00:32:12.597,00:32:13.765,You're not sure?
00:32:25.735,00:32:26.736,Hey.
00:32:28.279,00:32:30.114,"Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?"
00:32:30.198,00:32:32.700,"Nothing, he's probably just hungry. Come on."
00:33:53.406,00:33:55.992,"What are you, deaf? I've been calling you."
00:34:00.705,00:34:01.831,Hello?
00:34:01.914,00:34:05.001,"-Are you sure you're okay, Chief? -Listen, I want you to call Flo."
00:34:05.084,00:34:06.419,"I want to get a search party together, all right?"
00:34:06.502,00:34:09.630,"All the volunteers she can muster. Bring flashlights, too."
00:34:21.893,00:34:25.354,"We've been over this, Mike. The chief says-- -I don't care what the chief said. -Michael!"
00:34:25.438,00:34:27.106,We have to do something. Will can be in danger.
00:34:27.190,00:34:28.399,More reason to stay put.
00:34:28.483,00:34:30.526,-Mom! -End of discussion.
00:34:34.739,00:34:38.659,So... me and Barbara are gonna study at her house tonight.
00:34:38.743,00:34:41.162,"-That's cool, right? -No, not cool."
00:34:41.245,00:34:42.497,What? Why not?
00:34:42.580,00:34:45.792,Why do you think? Am I speaking Chinese in this house?
00:34:45.875,00:34:48.920,"Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves."
00:34:49.003,00:34:50.797,-This is such bullshit. -Language.
00:34:50.880,00:34:52.298,So we're under house arrest?
00:34:52.381,00:34:54.300,Just because Mike's friend got lost on the way home from...
00:34:54.383,00:34:56.677,"-Wait, this is Will's fault? -Nancy, take that back."
00:34:56.761,00:35:00.348,-No! -You're just pissed off 'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.
00:35:01.974,00:35:03.226,-Steve? -Who is Steve?
00:35:03.309,00:35:05.728,"-Her new boyfriend. -You are such a douchebag, Mike!"
00:35:09.273,00:35:10.691,"Nancy, come back."
00:35:11.526,00:35:12.777,Come back!
00:35:16.989,00:35:18.032,"You see, Michael?"
00:35:20.493,00:35:24.080,I'm the only one acting normal here! I'm the only one that cares about Will!
00:35:24.163,00:35:26.207,"That is really unfair, son."
00:35:26.290,00:35:27.500,We care.
00:35:32.380,00:35:34.173,-Mike! -Let him go.
00:35:36.884,00:35:39.303,"I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted."
00:35:40.054,00:35:41.597,What did I do?
00:35:43.933,00:35:46.519,Hey! What'd I do?
00:36:03.327,00:36:04.954,"Great one, actually."
00:36:05.454,00:36:07.373,I don't think we've met. Scott Clarke.
00:36:07.456,00:36:10.751,"Teacher, Hawkins Middle. Earth and biology."
00:36:20.094,00:36:22.263,"She's still kicking around, believe it or not."
00:36:26.767,00:36:28.269,"Sarah, my daughter..."
00:36:29.645,00:36:33.816,"Galaxies, the universe, whatnot... She always understood all that stuff."
00:36:33.900,00:36:38.196,"I always figured there was enough going on down here, I never needed to look elsewhere."
00:36:40.573,00:36:43.367,"-Maybe I'll get her in my class. -No, she, uh..."
00:36:43.451,00:36:45.995,She lives with her mom in the city.
00:36:46.078,00:36:49.540,"Thanks for coming out, Teach. We really appreciate it."
00:36:51.751,00:36:54.629,-She died a few years back. -Sorry?
00:36:54.712,00:36:55.963,His kid.
00:37:08.434,00:37:09.977,"Lucas, do you copy? It's Mike."
00:37:10.061,00:37:12.897,"-Lucas? -Hey, it's Lucas."
00:37:12.980,00:37:13.981,I know it's you.
00:37:14.065,00:37:17.235,And say over when you're done talking so I know when you're done. Over.
00:37:17.318,00:37:18.945,I'm done. Over.
00:37:19.028,00:37:21.447,I'm worried about Will. Over.
00:37:25.409,00:37:27.328,This is crazy. Over.
00:37:27.411,00:37:29.038,I was thinking...
00:37:30.539,00:37:33.376,"Will could've cast Protection last night, but he didn't."
00:37:33.459,00:37:34.460,He cast Fireball.
00:37:34.543,00:37:38.297,-Over. -What's your point? Over.
00:37:38.381,00:37:43.094,"My point is... he could've played it safe, but he didn't."
00:37:43.177,00:37:45.054,He put himself in danger to help the party.
00:37:45.137,00:37:46.264,Over.
00:37:49.058,00:37:51.477,Meet me in ten. Over and out.
00:38:23.384,00:38:25.678,"I told you on the phone, I'm under house arrest now."
00:38:25.761,00:38:28.597,-I figured we'd just study here. -No. No way.
00:38:28.681,00:38:30.933,"Oh, come on. I can't have you failing this test."
00:38:31.017,00:38:32.810,So just... bear with me.
00:38:35.855,00:38:36.856,What'd I tell you?
00:38:38.274,00:38:39.400,Ninja.
00:38:53.456,00:38:54.915,"You like that ice cream, huh?"
00:38:56.167,00:38:57.585,Smile looks good on you.
00:38:58.419,00:39:00.004,"You know, smile?"
00:39:09.013,00:39:10.765,All right. You just sit tight.
00:39:10.848,00:39:14.226,"Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away real quick, all right?"
00:39:20.232,00:39:22.735,"-Hey, can I help you? -Hi, you must be Benny Hammond."
00:39:22.818,00:39:25.071,"I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid we're closed for the evening, too."
00:39:25.154,00:39:27.907,-So try back tomorrow morning. -Connie Frazier. Social Services.
00:39:27.990,00:39:30.868,"Ah, Social Services. My apologies. I didn't expect you so soon."
00:39:30.951,00:39:33.788,-That's a heck of a drive. -Not too bad this time of night.
00:39:33.871,00:39:36.123,"Hey, listen, I... I haven't told her that you're coming yet."
00:39:36.207,00:39:40.169,I didn't want her running off again. She's a tad skittish.
00:39:40.252,00:39:42.880,"-Children I work with usually are. -Right, right."
00:39:43.464,00:39:46.300,"-So, where is she? -Right. She's in the kitchen."
00:39:46.384,00:39:48.219,-Come on up. I'll introduce you. -Thank you.
00:39:48.302,00:39:50.096,Sorry again for trying to turn you away there.
00:39:50.179,00:39:51.222,"-It's fine. -You know, it's funny."
00:40:36.225,00:40:38.060,"Hey, guys. You feel that?"
00:40:41.105,00:40:42.773,-I think maybe we should go back. -No.
00:40:42.857,00:40:45.484,We're not going back. Just stay close.
00:40:45.568,00:40:46.694,Come on.
00:40:47.820,00:40:51.157,Just stay on channel six. Don't do anything stupid.

00:41:29.945,00:41:32.823,"But every time that you get something wrong-- -Uh, pass. -Oh, come on."
00:41:32.907,00:41:33.949,-Come on. -No.

00:41:44.460,00:41:45.878,That's what I meant.
00:41:45.961,00:41:47.963,"Yeah, that's not what you said."
00:41:48.881,00:41:50.674,-No. -No?
00:41:51.550,00:41:53.886,"Oh, do you need... Do you need help, or..."
00:41:53.969,00:41:55.012,No.
00:42:18.244,00:42:19.245,What?
00:42:19.328,00:42:21.455,Are you crazy? My parents are here.
00:42:23.165,00:42:25.668,"That's weird, I... don't see them."
00:42:29.505,00:42:34.176,Was this your plan all along? To... to get in my room and then...
00:42:34.260,00:42:36.845,"-get another notch on your belt. -No. Nancy, no."
00:42:36.929,00:42:39.056,"I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky."
00:42:39.139,00:42:40.724,"You mean, you're not a slut."
00:42:41.559,00:42:42.643,That's not what I'm saying.
00:42:42.726,00:42:44.478,"You know, you're so cute when you lie."
00:42:44.979,00:42:46.230,Shut up.
00:42:49.108,00:42:50.484,Bad Steve.
00:42:54.697,00:42:56.740,"You're an idiot, Steve Harrington."
00:42:57.658,00:42:59.702,"You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler."
00:43:06.125,00:43:12.548,"Compared to the rate of inorganic reactions, the rate of organic reactions is generally..."
00:43:19.513,00:43:21.015,These are great.
00:43:29.440,00:43:31.525,working so hard and I...
00:43:31.609,00:43:33.444,I just feel bad. I don't even...
00:43:36.071,00:43:38.824,All right? I am sorry about that.
00:43:42.202,00:43:43.495,"Hey, what is it?"
00:43:44.413,00:43:45.748,"What is it, honey?"
00:43:50.002,00:43:52.046,-Come on. You can... -No.
00:43:52.129,00:43:53.297,It's just...
00:43:59.470,00:44:02.681,This was not your fault. Do you hear me?
00:44:10.564,00:44:13.359,"You just have to... You have to trust me on this, okay?"
00:44:16.111,00:44:17.780,"-Yeah. -Oh, look at this."
00:44:17.863,00:44:20.240,Look at this one. Look at this one.
00:44:22.576,00:44:24.745,"-I mean, that's it, right? -Yeah."
00:44:34.922,00:44:35.964,Lonnie?
00:44:36.048,00:44:37.800,-Dad? -Hopper?
00:44:43.222,00:44:44.264,Will?
00:44:45.140,00:44:46.225,-Will? -It's Will?
00:44:55.150,00:44:56.652,Give me back my son!
00:45:00.531,00:45:01.782,"Hello, who is this?"
00:45:08.997,00:45:10.207,-Yes. -What did he say?
00:45:14.545,00:45:17.256,"-Mom, who was there? Who was it? -It was him."
00:45:17.339,00:45:20.050,I know it was his breathing. I know it was his breathing.
00:45:29.810,00:45:31.895,"Guys, I really think we should turn back."
00:45:33.313,00:45:35.607,"You wanna be a baby, then go home already!"
00:45:35.691,00:45:37.401,"I'm just being realistic, Lucas!"
00:45:37.484,00:45:39.486,"No, you're just being a big sissy!"
00:45:43.574,00:45:46.452,And we're going to the exact same spot where he was last seen?
00:45:46.535,00:45:49.371,"-And we have no weapons or anything? -Dustin, shut up."
00:45:49.455,00:45:51.457,"I'm just saying, does that seem smart to you?"
00:45:53.750,00:45:55.419,Did you guys hear that?
00:00:16.850,00:00:18.935,Where's your hair? Do you have cancer?
00:00:20.311,00:00:22.230,-Are you in some kind of trouble? -Is that blood?
00:00:23.022,00:00:25.108,-Stop it! You're freaking her out! -She's freaking me out!
00:00:25.191,00:00:26.401,I bet she's deaf.
00:00:28.486,00:00:29.571,Not deaf.
00:00:29.654,00:00:32.949,"All right, that's enough, all right? She's just scared and cold."
00:00:39.581,00:00:41.416,"Here, these are clean. Okay?"
00:00:58.516,00:01:00.518,Privacy. Get it?
00:01:15.742,00:01:16.910,You don't want it closed?
00:01:18.745,00:01:19.746,No.
00:01:19.829,00:01:21.915,"Oh, so you can speak."
00:01:21.998,00:01:24.209,"Okay, well..."
00:01:24.292,00:01:28.296,"Um, how about we just keep the door..."
00:01:30.548,00:01:32.133,just like this.
00:01:32.634,00:01:35.345,-Is that better? -Yes.
00:01:43.186,00:01:46.064,She said no and yes. Your three-year-old sister says more.
00:01:46.147,00:01:47.857,She tried to get naked.
00:01:47.941,00:01:49.567,There's something seriously wrong with her.
00:01:49.651,00:01:53.154,"-Like, wrong in the head. -She just went like..."
00:01:53.238,00:01:54.697,I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.
00:01:54.781,00:01:57.408,-From where? -The nuthouse in Kerley County.
00:01:57.492,00:01:59.119,-You got a lot of family there? -Bite me.
00:01:59.202,00:02:01.204,"Seriously though, think about it."
00:02:01.287,00:02:04.332,That would explain her shaved hair and why she's so crazy.
00:02:05.625,00:02:08.419,She's an escapee is the point. She's probably a psycho.
00:02:10.588,00:02:12.173,We should've never brought her here.
00:02:12.257,00:02:13.591,So you just wanted to leave her out in that storm?
00:02:13.675,00:02:16.427,"Yes! We went out to find Will, not another problem."
00:02:16.511,00:02:18.221,-I think we should tell your mom. -I second that.
00:02:18.304,00:02:20.265,-Who's crazy now? -How is that crazy?
00:02:20.348,00:02:22.934,"'Cause, we weren't supposed to be out tonight, remember?"
00:02:23.017,00:02:27.272,-So? -So if I tell my mom and she tells your mom and your mom...
00:02:27.355,00:02:29.607,"-Oh, man. -Our houses become Alcatraz."
00:02:29.691,00:02:32.277,Exactly. We'll never find Will.
00:02:34.028,00:02:36.573,"All right, here's the plan. She sleeps here tonight."
00:02:36.656,00:02:38.783,-You're letting a girl-- -Just listen!
00:02:38.867,00:02:42.954,"In the morning, she sneaks around my house, goes to the front door and rings my doorbell."
00:02:43.037,00:02:44.831,My mom will answer and know exactly what to do.
00:02:44.914,00:02:47.167,She'll send her back to Pennhurst or wherever she comes from.
00:02:47.250,00:02:48.376,We'll be totally in the clear.
00:02:48.459,00:02:50.253,"And tomorrow night, we go back out."
00:02:50.336,00:02:52.714,"And this time, we find Will."
00:02:57.343,00:02:59.345,Here you go. This is my sleeping bag.
00:03:01.806,00:03:03.391,Wouldn't want her in my house.
00:03:11.608,00:03:13.776,"Hey, um, I never asked your name."
00:03:21.242,00:03:22.493,Is that real?
00:03:25.330,00:03:29.584,"Sorry, I've just... never seen a kid with a tattoo before."
00:03:30.418,00:03:32.211,What's it mean? Eleven?
00:03:35.548,00:03:36.674,That's your name?
00:03:38.801,00:03:40.845,Eleven. Okay.
00:03:40.929,00:03:44.265,"Um, well, my name's Mike. Short for Michael."
00:03:44.349,00:03:47.560,Maybe we can call you El. Short for Eleven.
00:03:51.606,00:03:53.024,"Um, well, okay."
00:03:53.942,00:03:55.193,"'Night, El."
00:03:57.445,00:03:58.738,"'Night, Mike."
00:05:53.144,00:05:56.814,"All right, Mom. Breakfast is ready."
00:05:56.898,00:05:59.692,"-What? No, be careful of the poster. -Yeah, okay. All right."
00:05:59.776,00:06:01.652,"-I can't eat. -I just need you to eat, Mom."
00:06:05.239,00:06:06.657,-Yeah. -And I don't want you to go alone...
00:06:06.741,00:06:07.825,"No, I know. I told you, I got it."
00:06:07.909,00:06:10.328,"...so I'm gonna have Karen take you, 'cause I should be here."
00:06:10.411,00:06:12.789,"-Okay. -We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?"
00:06:12.872,00:06:13.998,"-How much is a copy? -Yeah, okay."
00:06:14.082,00:06:15.166,"-Okay, Mom. Mom. -Ten cents?"
00:06:20.296,00:06:22.715,"-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -No, it's okay."
00:06:28.679,00:06:30.389,I know. I came as soon as I could.
00:06:30.473,00:06:32.058,Six hours.
00:06:32.141,00:06:34.268,"A little bit of trust here, all right?"
00:06:34.352,00:06:37.313,We've been searching all night. Went all the way to Cartersville.
00:06:37.396,00:06:39.065,-And? -Nothing.
00:06:39.148,00:06:40.566,God.
00:06:43.236,00:06:44.654,Flo says you got a phone call?
00:06:44.737,00:06:46.906,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:55.915,00:06:58.334,-The storm? -What else?
00:06:58.417,00:07:01.337,You're saying that that's not weird?
00:07:01.420,00:07:03.089,"No, it's weird."
00:07:03.172,00:07:07.760,"Can we, like, trace who made the call? Contact the-- No, it doesn't work like that."
00:07:07.844,00:07:09.595,"Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?"
00:07:09.679,00:07:11.347,Because Flo said you just heard some breathing.
00:07:11.431,00:07:14.475,No. It was him. It was Will.
00:07:19.605,00:07:22.442,It was probably just a prank call. It was somebody trying to scare you.
00:07:22.525,00:07:24.277,"-Who would do that? -Well, this thing's been on TV."
00:07:24.360,00:07:27.530,"It brings out all the crazies, you know. False leads, prank calls, uh..."
00:07:27.613,00:07:30.616,"No, Hopper, it was not a prank. It was him."
00:07:30.700,00:07:33.327,"-Joyce. -Come on, how about a little trust here?"
00:07:34.328,00:07:36.622,"What, you think I'm... I'm making this up?"
00:07:36.706,00:07:38.166,I'm not saying that you're making it up.
00:07:38.249,00:07:40.710,All I'm saying is it's an emotional time for you.
00:07:40.793,00:07:44.088,And you think I don't know my own son's breathing?
00:07:44.172,00:07:45.798,Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?
00:07:59.687,00:08:02.857,"-You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet? -No."
00:08:03.441,00:08:05.318,It's been long enough. I'm having him checked out.
00:08:07.153,00:08:09.238,You're wasting your time.
00:08:11.199,00:08:12.950,"Hey, Hopper."
00:08:15.286,00:08:16.537,Let me go.
00:08:18.164,00:08:19.957,-I'm sorry? -To Lonnie's.
00:08:23.002,00:08:25.421,"And if he sees the cops, he'll think he's in trouble."
00:08:25.505,00:08:27.215,He'll... He'll hide.
00:08:27.298,00:08:29.008,"-You know, he's good at hiding. -Yeah?"
00:08:30.176,00:08:32.428,"Well, cops are good at finding. Okay?"
00:08:32.512,00:08:34.180,Stay here with your mom.
00:08:35.389,00:08:36.474,She needs you.
00:08:55.201,00:08:57.828,"Slow down, Mike. That's disgusting."
00:08:59.288,00:09:01.165,Do a lot of studying last night?
00:09:01.916,00:09:03.834,"Yeah, actually, I did."
00:09:03.918,00:09:06.295,What was your test on again? Human anatomy?
00:09:08.339,00:09:10.091,"Hey, what's going on?"
00:09:24.021,00:09:25.398,"Hey, you found my supercomm."
00:09:25.481,00:09:26.649,"Pretty cool, huh?"
00:09:27.316,00:09:28.609,I talk to my friends with it.
00:09:28.693,00:09:30.570,"Mostly Lucas, 'cause he lives so close."
00:09:30.653,00:09:31.737,Signal's pretty weak.
00:09:35.950,00:09:37.118,Got you breakfast.
00:09:39.704,00:09:43.082,"So listen, this is gonna sound a little weird, but I just need you to go out there."
00:09:43.165,00:09:45.293,Then go to the front door and ring the doorbell.
00:09:45.376,00:09:48.921,My mom will answer and you'll tell her that you're lost and that you need help.
00:09:49.005,00:09:53.134,"But whatever you do, you can't tell her about last night or that you know me."
00:09:53.217,00:09:54.218,Understand?
00:09:55.344,00:09:56.721,"Really, it's no big deal."
00:09:56.804,00:09:58.931,We'll just pretend to meet each other again.
00:09:59.932,00:10:02.602,"And my mom, she'll know who to call."
00:10:05.062,00:10:06.105,No.
00:10:07.398,00:10:08.524,No?
00:10:09.358,00:10:10.359,No.
00:10:11.360,00:10:14.780,No... you don't want my mom to get help?
00:10:19.577,00:10:22.121,"You're in trouble, aren't you?"
00:10:25.958,00:10:27.001,Who...
00:10:28.461,00:10:30.129,Who are you in trouble with?
00:10:32.882,00:10:34.425,Bad.
00:10:34.508,00:10:35.593,Bad?
00:10:36.594,00:10:37.762,Bad people?
00:10:41.432,00:10:43.476,They want to hurt you?
00:10:43.559,00:10:44.977,The bad people?
00:10:54.737,00:10:56.405,Understand?
00:11:01.869,00:11:03.621,"Just stay here, okay? Stay here."
00:11:10.961,00:11:12.380,When was this?
00:11:12.463,00:11:14.090,Last night. Less than two miles away.
00:11:14.173,00:11:15.966,-And the boy? -Still missing.
00:11:19.845,00:11:22.139,And I... I heard something else.
00:11:51.710,00:11:54.463,About one step from falling off the edge.
00:11:54.547,00:11:56.966,"She's been a few steps for a while now, hasn't she?"
00:11:57.049,00:11:58.801,"Kid's missing, man."
00:11:58.884,00:12:00.177,Show a little class.
00:12:01.178,00:12:03.681,"All right. Come on, let's go!"
00:12:03.764,00:12:06.016,We got a lot of ground to cover.
00:12:06.100,00:12:08.519,"The chief and her, they've screwed before, huh?"
00:12:11.063,00:12:12.731,Will!
00:12:12.815,00:12:14.275,That a yeah or did they...
00:12:15.317,00:12:17.403,-Will! -Will!
00:12:24.952,00:12:28.372,"When alpha particles go through gold foil, they become..."
00:12:28.456,00:12:33.544,"-Unoccupied space. -A molecule that can-- I think you've studied enough, Nance."
00:12:35.754,00:12:38.090,"Don't worry. Now, on to more important matters."
00:12:38.174,00:12:43.637,"My dad has left town on a conference and my mom's gone with him, -'cause, you know, she doesn't trust him. -Good call."
00:12:43.721,00:12:44.722,So are you in?
00:12:44.805,00:12:46.223,In for what?
00:12:46.307,00:12:48.058,No parents? Big house?
00:12:48.726,00:12:49.852,A party?
00:12:51.979,00:12:53.397,It's Tuesday.
00:12:56.442,00:12:58.194,It'll be low key. It'll just be us.
00:12:58.277,00:13:00.654,What do you say? Are you in or are you out?
00:13:00.738,00:13:04.575,"-Um... -Oh, God. Look."
00:13:05.576,00:13:07.286,"Oh, God, that's depressing."
00:13:09.497,00:13:12.750,-Should we say something? -I don't think he speaks.
00:13:12.833,00:13:14.585,How much you want to bet he killed him?
00:13:14.668,00:13:15.920,Shut up.
00:13:24.803,00:13:26.388,"Oh, hey."
00:13:26.472,00:13:27.640,I just...
00:13:28.807,00:13:32.102,"I wanted to say, you know, um..."
00:13:32.186,00:13:34.104,I'm sorry about everything.
00:13:39.527,00:13:41.820,Everyone's thinking about you.
00:13:43.948,00:13:46.617,-It sucks. -Yeah.
00:13:50.120,00:13:51.372,I'm sure he's fine.
00:13:51.455,00:13:53.123,He's a smart kid.
00:13:58.003,00:13:59.004,Yeah.
00:13:59.088,00:14:00.548,-Good luck. -Thanks.
00:14:07.972,00:14:13.852,"At 8:00 p.m. tonight, there will be an assembly on the football field in support of Will Byers and his family."
00:14:13.936,00:14:16.063,All are encouraged to attend.
00:14:16.146,00:14:20.317,Volunteer sign-ups for search parties are still available in the office.
00:14:26.490,00:14:27.700,"Oh, this is weird."
00:14:28.158,00:14:31.161,"-He's never this late. -I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed."
00:14:31.245,00:14:32.496,I thought you liked his plan.
00:14:32.580,00:14:34.915,"Yeah, but obviously it was stupid, or he'd be here."
00:14:34.999,00:14:38.544,If his mom found out a girl spent the night-- He's in deep shit right about now.
00:14:38.627,00:14:41.297,"Hey, what if she slept naked?"
00:14:41.380,00:14:43.299,"Oh, my God, she didn't."
00:14:43.382,00:14:45.593,"Oh, if Mrs. Wheeler tells my parents..."
00:14:45.676,00:14:48.554,-No way. Mike would never rat us out. -I don't know.
00:14:48.637,00:14:55.060,"All that matters is, after school, the freak will be back in the loony bin, and we can focus on what really matters, finding Will."
00:15:12.494,00:15:15.164,"We have OJ, skim milk... What else?"
00:15:16.498,00:15:17.875,"Um, we have..."
00:15:19.793,00:15:21.545,"Oh, this is my living room."
00:15:21.629,00:15:23.172,It's mostly just for watching TV.
00:15:23.255,00:15:25.799,"Nice, right? It's a 22-inch."
00:15:25.883,00:15:27.968,"That's, like, ten times bigger than Dustin's."
00:15:39.438,00:15:41.690,-Pretty. -I guess.
00:15:41.774,00:15:43.192,That's my sister Nancy.
00:15:43.275,00:15:44.902,And that's baby Holly.
00:15:47.029,00:15:48.155,What are your parents like?
00:15:48.781,00:15:50.199,Do they live close?
00:15:52.618,00:15:54.203,That's our La-Z-Boy.
00:15:55.913,00:15:57.164,It's where my dad sleeps.
00:15:57.247,00:15:59.959,You can try it if you want.
00:16:00.626,00:16:01.627,Yeah.
00:16:02.962,00:16:03.963,It's fun.
00:16:07.591,00:16:09.426,"Just trust me, okay?"
00:16:15.265,00:16:16.934,"See? Fun, right?"
00:16:18.811,00:16:19.812,Now you try.
00:17:02.563,00:17:04.189,"-You like it? -Yeah, it's cool."
00:17:04.273,00:17:05.941,"All right, you can keep the mix if you want."
00:17:06.025,00:17:07.151,"-Really? -Yeah, really."
00:17:07.234,00:17:08.819,All the best stuff's on there.
00:17:08.902,00:17:11.822,"Joy Division, Bowie, Television, The Smiths..."
00:17:11.905,00:17:13.615,It'll totally change your life.
00:17:13.699,00:17:15.367,"Yeah, totally."
00:17:17.619,00:17:19.079,I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it.
00:17:34.094,00:17:35.471,Do you even like baseball?
00:17:36.597,00:17:38.807,"No, but... I don't know."
00:17:38.891,00:17:40.893,-It's fun to go with him sometimes. -Come on.
00:17:40.976,00:17:43.729,Has he ever done anything with you that you actually like?
00:17:43.812,00:17:45.564,"You know, like the arcade or something?"
00:17:46.356,00:17:49.068,"-I don't know. -No, all right? He hasn't."
00:17:49.151,00:17:50.986,He's trying to force you to like normal things.
00:17:51.070,00:17:54.114,And you shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to.
00:17:54.198,00:17:55.491,Okay?
00:17:56.283,00:17:57.993,Especially not him.
00:17:59.870,00:18:02.247,But you like The Clash? For real?
00:18:02.331,00:18:04.458,For real. Definitely.
00:18:49.002,00:18:51.130,"The storm last night, I..."
00:18:55.134,00:18:58.554,"Okay, that looks like $22.56."
00:18:58.637,00:19:00.430,"Uh, yeah, you know, uh..."
00:19:00.514,00:19:02.808,I gave Jonathan all my money for...
00:19:02.891,00:19:04.685,for the copies for the posters.
00:19:05.686,00:19:08.147,"Uh, I need an advance."
00:19:09.064,00:19:10.566,"Yes, well, of course."
00:19:21.910,00:19:23.162,Um...
00:19:24.955,00:19:29.376,"Yes, I understand, but, you know, I have to pay Jeffrey for covering-- Donald."
00:19:29.459,00:19:32.671,"I've been here ten years, right?"
00:19:32.754,00:19:36.717,Have I ever called in sick or missed a shift once?
00:19:36.800,00:19:40.179,"I've worked, uh, Christmas Eve and Thanksgiving."
00:19:43.765,00:19:44.975,He's gone.
00:19:45.058,00:19:49.104,"I don't know if I'm... gonna ever see him again, if he's hurt..."
00:19:53.734,00:19:57.446,I need this phone and two weeks' advance.
00:20:01.074,00:20:02.826,And a pack of Camels.
00:21:12.479,00:21:14.106,Extraordinary.
00:21:21.405,00:21:24.533,"He can use the Force to move things with his mind, like this."
00:21:24.616,00:21:25.951,Whoosh!
00:21:27.703,00:21:29.413,"Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory."
00:21:29.496,00:21:31.331,"Look, he has a speaker in his mouth so he can roar."
00:21:40.090,00:21:42.384,"Oh, these are all my science fair trophies."
00:21:42.467,00:21:44.803,We got first every year.
00:21:44.886,00:21:47.597,Except for last year when we got third.
00:21:47.681,00:21:49.766,Mr. Clarke said it was totally political.
00:22:09.745,00:22:10.871,You know Will?
00:22:11.913,00:22:16.043,Did you see him? Last night? On the road?
00:22:22.549,00:22:23.717,We gotta go.
00:22:34.436,00:22:36.563,Ted? Is that you?
00:22:36.646,00:22:37.856,"Just me, Mom!"
00:22:37.939,00:22:40.609,-Mike? What are you doing home? -One second!
00:22:45.030,00:22:46.948,"In here. I'll be right back, okay?"
00:22:47.032,00:22:49.743,"Please, you have to get in, or my mom, she'll find you."
00:22:49.826,00:22:51.787,Do you understand?
00:22:51.870,00:22:53.455,I won't tell her about you. I promise.
00:22:53.538,00:22:54.915,Promise?
00:22:54.998,00:22:57.000,It means something that you can't break.
00:22:59.628,00:23:00.670,Please?
00:23:26.571,00:23:27.864,Papa!
00:23:27.948,00:23:29.282,No!
00:23:30.200,00:23:31.326,Papa!
00:23:31.409,00:23:33.745,No! No! No!
00:23:38.542,00:23:39.584,Papa!
00:23:41.419,00:23:42.838,Papa!
00:23:49.845,00:23:50.887,Papa.
00:24:00.480,00:24:02.899,I just... I don't feel good.
00:24:02.983,00:24:11.408,"I woke up and my head, it really hurt bad, and my throat was all scratchy, and I wanted to tell you, but the last time I told you I was sick -you made me go to school anyway, and-- -Michael."
00:24:11.491,00:24:14.327,-Yeah? -I'm not mad at you.
00:24:14.411,00:24:17.706,"-No? -No, of course not."
00:24:20.041,00:24:25.172,"All this that's been going on with Will, I can't imagine what it's been like for you."
00:24:26.506,00:24:27.966,I just...
00:24:28.508,00:24:30.510,I want you to feel like you can talk to me.
00:24:30.594,00:24:34.347,I never want you to feel like you have to hide anything from me.
00:24:34.431,00:24:36.558,I'm here for you. Okay?
00:24:39.144,00:24:40.312,Is there someone else here?
00:24:42.022,00:24:43.023,No.
00:24:45.150,00:24:46.526,Eleven?
00:24:46.610,00:24:48.195,Is everything okay?
00:24:48.278,00:24:49.321,El?
00:24:58.663,00:25:00.123,Are you sure?
00:25:01.416,00:25:02.792,Promise.
00:25:46.044,00:25:48.255,"I need you alive for the next few days, at least."
00:25:53.885,00:25:56.221,And he was drunk as a skunk. He did it on a $10 bet.
00:25:56.304,00:25:57.305,George is a liar.
00:25:57.389,00:26:00.267,"You make that jump from this height, that water turns into cement."
00:26:00.350,00:26:02.852,Hits you like a ton of bricks. Break every damn bone in your body.
00:26:05.939,00:26:07.148,Nah.
00:26:10.610,00:26:12.112,"Yeah, Flo, talk to me."
00:26:12.195,00:26:14.948,"Hey, Chief, we got a call from over at Benny's."
00:26:15.031,00:26:16.866,I think you need to get there right away.
00:26:39.806,00:26:41.308,"Ugh, Jesus!"
00:26:47.480,00:26:48.606,Suicide?
00:26:50.066,00:26:51.568,Mmm-hmm.
00:26:53.820,00:26:56.531,"You must feel like a big city cop again, huh, Chief?"
00:26:58.241,00:27:00.994,"Well, I mostly dealt with strangers back then."
00:27:03.455,00:27:05.248,Benny was my friend.
00:27:42.035,00:27:43.328,Hello?
00:27:48.958,00:27:51.252,"-Can I help you? -Yeah, is Lonnie around?"
00:27:51.336,00:27:53.338,"-Yeah, he's out back. What do you want? -To look around."
00:27:53.421,00:27:55.924,"-Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey! -I'll be fast."
00:27:57.425,00:27:58.802,Will!
00:27:58.885,00:28:00.970,"Will, you here? Will!"
00:28:05.892,00:28:07.102,Get off!
00:28:08.269,00:28:09.854,"Damn, you've gotten stronger."
00:28:09.938,00:28:12.065,Will someone please explain what the hell is going on?
00:28:13.024,00:28:16.319,"Jonathan, Cynthia. Cynthia, this is Jonathan."
00:28:16.403,00:28:17.404,My oldest.
00:28:19.489,00:28:22.367,"-Come here. -Get off me, man."
00:28:35.547,00:28:37.841,-Are you out of your mind? -Just listen to me.
00:28:37.924,00:28:39.718,-You are out of your mind! -She knows about Will.
00:28:39.801,00:28:41.511,What do you mean she knows about Will?
00:28:42.637,00:28:45.682,"She pointed at him, at his picture. She knew he was missing. I could tell."
00:28:47.726,00:28:51.646,"Do you really think it was a coincidence that we found her on Mirkwood, the same place where Will disappeared?"
00:28:51.730,00:28:54.023,-That is weird. -And she said bad people are after her.
00:28:54.107,00:28:57.402,I think maybe these bad people are the same ones that took Will.
00:28:57.485,00:29:00.864,-I think she knows what happened to him. -Then why doesn't she tell us?
00:29:03.032,00:29:05.076,Do you know where he is?
00:29:06.244,00:29:08.580,"-Stop it, you're scaring her! -She should be scared!"
00:29:08.663,00:29:11.541,"If you know where he is, tell us!"
00:29:12.876,00:29:15.420,This is nuts. We have to take her to your mom.
00:29:15.503,00:29:17.922,No! Eleven said telling any adult would put us in danger.
00:29:18.006,00:29:20.425,-What kind of danger? -Her name is Eleven?
00:29:20.508,00:29:23.011,"-El for short. -Mike, what kind of danger?"
00:29:23.094,00:29:24.721,Danger danger.
00:29:30.560,00:29:32.479,"No, no, no!"
00:29:32.562,00:29:35.315,We're going back to plan A. We're telling your mom.
00:29:46.910,00:29:47.994,No.
00:29:57.003,00:29:58.880,"Took me a year, but it's almost done."
00:29:59.881,00:30:02.759,"Really? You want to check up my ass, too?"
00:30:03.426,00:30:06.930,"I told you the same thing as I told those cops, he's not here and he never has been."
00:30:07.013,00:30:10.016,"-Then why didn't you call Mom back? -I don't know, I just..."
00:30:10.099,00:30:12.602,I assumed she just forgot where he was.
00:30:12.685,00:30:14.229,"You know, he was lost or something."
00:30:15.271,00:30:17.565,That boy never was very good at taking care of himself.
00:30:17.649,00:30:20.777,"This isn't some joke, all right? There are search parties, reporters..."
00:30:20.860,00:30:22.195,"Hopper's not still chief, is he?"
00:30:24.322,00:30:27.408,Tell your mother she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.
00:30:27.492,00:30:29.452,Come out here to the city.
00:30:29.536,00:30:31.162,"People are more real here, you know?"
00:30:32.539,00:30:33.957,And then I could see you more.
00:30:36.125,00:30:38.586,"-What, you think I don't want to see you? -I know you don't."
00:30:38.670,00:30:40.713,"See, that's your mother talkin' right there."
00:30:41.965,00:30:43.091,She even know you're here?
00:30:44.133,00:30:45.134,"Oh, great."
00:30:45.218,00:30:47.929,"So one kid goes missing, the other one runs wild?"
00:30:48.012,00:30:49.806,Some real fine parenting right there.
00:30:49.889,00:30:53.643,"Look, all I'm saying is, maybe I'm not the asshole, all right?"
00:30:58.356,00:31:00.024,In case you forgot what he looks like.
00:31:05.446,00:31:07.490,Maybe I'll trade you in for the younger model?
00:31:15.039,00:31:16.457,"You, uh, notice anything..."
00:31:17.500,00:31:18.877,odd about him the last few weeks?
00:31:18.960,00:31:22.213,"No, we're fixin' to go fishing down the Etowah next Sunday."
00:31:22.297,00:31:24.424,"I mean, he was lookin' forward to it. I know that."
00:31:24.507,00:31:26.718,He got any enemies you might know about?
00:31:26.801,00:31:28.887,"I mean, people who might not want him around?"
00:31:32.974,00:31:34.517,nah.
00:31:34.601,00:31:38.354,"-When was the last time you saw him? -Yesterday. Lunch, same as always."
00:31:38.438,00:31:40.690,-Just you and the boys? -Yep.
00:31:44.152,00:31:46.696,"Well, there was this, uh, this kid."
00:31:47.697,00:31:48.823,No kid did this.
00:31:49.782,00:31:50.825,Kid?
00:31:52.243,00:31:53.703,What are you talking about?
00:31:53.786,00:31:58.708,"Yeah. At lunch, uh, there was this boy that, uh..."
00:31:58.791,00:32:01.544,"I mean, he was trying to steal food out of Benny's kitchen."
00:32:01.628,00:32:03.004,Can you imagine that?
00:32:05.965,00:32:07.008,This kid...
00:32:08.635,00:32:09.761,what'd he look like?
00:32:10.929,00:32:14.223,"Well, he was about yea high. You know, tiny like."
00:32:14.307,00:32:16.684,"I didn't get a good look at him, though. He was back in the kitchen."
00:32:16.768,00:32:18.227,He look like this?
00:32:19.020,00:32:21.940,"Oh, no, that's... That's Lonnie's missin' kid."
00:32:22.023,00:32:24.067,No. This was a different kid.
00:32:24.150,00:32:25.610,This one had really short hair.
00:32:25.693,00:32:27.779,"I mean, it was buzzed nearly down to the scalp."
00:32:27.862,00:32:30.490,"Yeah, well, let's... You know, let's forget about the haircut."
00:32:30.573,00:32:33.660,"I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut..."
00:32:33.743,00:32:35.119,could it be Lonnie's kid?
00:32:35.870,00:32:38.164,"Well, I... I didn't get a good look at him."
00:32:40.166,00:32:42.126,"About the right height, though."
00:32:42.210,00:32:43.878,"I mean, could've been."
00:32:44.963,00:32:46.631,"Yeah, that's..."
00:32:46.714,00:32:47.715,Could've been.
00:32:51.219,00:32:53.930,Because I don't want to go by myself.
00:32:54.013,00:32:57.183,"Barb... Barb, it's not rocket science."
00:32:57.266,00:33:00.645,You just tell your parents you're gonna stay at my place afterwards.
00:33:00.728,00:33:03.606,"No, tell them we're... studying."
00:33:05.483,00:33:07.193,Coming!
00:33:07.276,00:33:09.946,"Look, I gotta go. I'll see you in an hour."
00:33:19.664,00:33:21.290,Something wrong with the meatloaf?
00:33:22.166,00:33:25.211,"Oh, no, I had two bologna sandwiches for lunch."
00:33:27.005,00:33:28.006,I don't know why.
00:33:31.175,00:33:33.511,"-It's delicious, Mommy. -Thank you, sweetie."
00:33:34.345,00:33:35.972,"So, there's this..."
00:33:36.055,00:33:38.558,special assembly thing tonight...
00:33:38.641,00:33:40.935,for Will at the school field.
00:33:41.019,00:33:42.020,Barb's driving.
00:33:42.103,00:33:44.272,Why am I just hearing about this?
00:33:45.148,00:33:46.190,I thought you knew.
00:33:46.274,00:33:49.360,"I told you, I don't want you out after dark until Will is found."
00:33:49.444,00:33:52.780,"I know, I know, but it'd be super weird if I'm not there."
00:33:52.864,00:33:54.907,"I mean, everyone's going."
00:33:58.161,00:34:00.079,Just... be back by 10:00.
00:34:01.497,00:34:02.665,"Why don't you take the boys, too?"
00:34:02.749,00:34:03.958,-No! -Mmm-mmm.
00:34:05.626,00:34:07.712,Don't you think you should be there? For Will?
00:34:11.758,00:34:14.010,Sorry. Spasm.
00:34:20.224,00:34:21.434,"It's okay, Holly."
00:34:21.517,00:34:23.352,-It's just a loud noise. -Nice.
00:34:49.003,00:34:50.588,And stealing food from Benny?
00:34:50.671,00:34:53.341,"Tell you what, when we find him, we'll ask."
00:34:53.424,00:34:55.051,Can't ask a corpse questions.
00:34:57.011,00:34:58.471,You got something?
00:35:03.851,00:35:05.770,Maybe nothing.
00:35:05.853,00:35:07.772,I found this. In there.
00:35:17.490,00:35:18.866,a scared enough one might.
00:35:18.950,00:35:21.327,His brother said he was good at hiding.
00:36:04.245,00:36:07.206,No adults. Just us and some meatloaf.
00:36:10.668,00:36:13.796,Don't worry. They won't tell anyone about you.
00:36:13.880,00:36:16.299,They promise. Right?
00:36:16.382,00:36:18.926,We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers.
00:36:21.387,00:36:26.017,What Dustin is trying to say is that they were just scared... earlier.
00:36:26.100,00:36:27.143,That's all.
00:36:27.226,00:36:29.145,We just wanted to find our friend.
00:36:29.729,00:36:30.771,Friend?
00:36:30.855,00:36:33.733,"Yeah, friend. Will?"
00:36:33.816,00:36:37.111,What is friend?
00:36:37.195,00:36:38.613,Is she serious?
00:36:41.282,00:36:44.535,"Um, a friend-- Is someone that you'd do anything for."
00:36:44.619,00:36:47.747,"You lend them your cool stuff, like comic books and trading cards."
00:36:47.830,00:36:49.123,And they never break a promise.
00:36:49.207,00:36:51.125,-Especially when there's spit. -Spit?
00:36:55.046,00:36:56.464,It's a bond.
00:36:56.547,00:37:00.218,"That's super important, because friends..."
00:37:00.301,00:37:02.553,they tell each other things.
00:37:02.637,00:37:04.388,Things that parents don't know.
00:37:13.356,00:37:14.649,Pull over!
00:37:17.360,00:37:19.237,What are we doing here?
00:37:19.320,00:37:20.905,His house is three blocks away.
00:37:20.988,00:37:22.448,We can't park in the driveway.
00:37:22.531,00:37:23.574,Are you serious?
00:37:23.658,00:37:24.784,"Yeah, the neighbors might see."
00:37:24.867,00:37:27.578,This is so stupid. I'm just gonna drop you off.
00:37:27.662,00:37:29.497,"Calm down, Barb. Come on."
00:37:29.580,00:37:32.124,You promised that you'd go. You're coming.
00:37:32.208,00:37:33.459,We're gonna have a great time.
00:37:33.542,00:37:35.086,He just wants to get in your pants.
00:37:36.879,00:37:39.173,Nance... seriously.
00:37:40.299,00:37:42.343,He invited you to his house.
00:37:42.969,00:37:44.345,His parents aren't home.
00:37:45.012,00:37:46.681,"Come on, you are not this stupid."
00:37:46.764,00:37:48.766,Tommy H. and Carol are gonna be there.
00:37:48.849,00:37:51.936,"Tommy and Carol have been having sex since, like, seventh grade."
00:37:52.937,00:37:54.897,"It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy."
00:37:54.981,00:37:57.942,-Gross. -I'm serious!
00:37:58.025,00:37:59.318,"All right, well..."
00:38:00.319,00:38:03.572,"you can be, like, my guardian. All right?"
00:38:03.656,00:38:06.117,Make sure I don't get drunk and do anything stupid.
00:38:06.200,00:38:07.201,Ugh.
00:38:10.538,00:38:11.747,Is that a new bra?
00:38:13.416,00:38:14.542,No.
00:38:27.305,00:38:28.973,"Barb, chill."
00:38:29.890,00:38:31.267,I'm chill.
00:38:36.355,00:38:37.732,"Hello, ladies."
00:39:12.308,00:39:13.809,It's freezing.
00:39:19.690,00:39:21.067,You ever feel cursed?
00:39:24.528,00:39:27.573,"You know, the last person to go missing here was in, uh..."
00:39:29.367,00:39:30.951,the summer of '23.
00:39:32.620,00:39:34.914,The last suicide was the fall of '61.
00:39:40.211,00:39:42.671,When'd the last person freeze to death?
00:39:46.175,00:39:48.386,"Hey, come back inside."
00:39:48.469,00:39:50.471,Warm me up. Just...
00:39:53.099,00:39:54.683,Just give me a minute out here.
00:40:29.176,00:40:30.219,El?
00:40:43.816,00:40:44.900,Will.
00:40:45.568,00:40:46.569,Superpowers.
00:40:53.701,00:40:56.620,Did you see him? On Mirkwood?
00:40:58.038,00:40:59.248,Do you know where he is?
00:41:17.766,00:41:18.934,Hiding.
00:41:19.059,00:41:20.686,Will is hiding?
00:41:25.441,00:41:27.026,From the bad men?
00:41:29.945,00:41:31.614,Then from who?
00:42:35.261,00:42:36.804,Where are you?
00:43:28.897,00:43:30.608,Is that supposed to impress me?
00:43:31.400,00:43:34.486,"-You're not? -You are a cliché, you do realize that?"
00:43:34.570,00:43:35.613,You are a cliché.
00:43:35.696,00:43:38.115,What with your... your grades and your band practice.
00:43:39.700,00:43:42.620,"Okay, party girl. Why don't you just, uh, show us how it's done, then?"
00:43:42.703,00:43:43.704,Okay.
00:43:50.836,00:43:52.755,-You gotta make a little hole right in-- -I got it.
00:43:52.838,00:43:55.049,"Yeah, she's smart, you douche!"
00:43:59.678,00:44:01.805,"Chug, chug, chug."
00:44:15.903,00:44:17.154,"Barb, you wanna try?"
00:44:17.988,00:44:19.531,What? No.
00:44:19.615,00:44:20.866,"No, I don't want to. Thanks."
00:44:23.577,00:44:25.287,-It's fun! Just give it a-- -Nance...
00:44:25.371,00:44:27.039,Just... Just give it a shot.
00:44:29.249,00:44:30.292,Okay.
00:44:35.881,00:44:37.007,So you just...
00:44:45.391,00:44:47.351,I'm fine. Where's your bathroom?
00:44:47.434,00:44:50.020,"Oh, it's... It's, uh, down past the kitchen, to the left."
00:45:05.077,00:45:08.205,"Oh, my, God! What the hell, Tommy?"
00:45:08.288,00:45:09.289,No!
00:45:53.000,00:45:54.042,Hello?
00:46:10.392,00:46:12.144,Talk to me.
00:46:12.227,00:46:13.604,I'm here.
00:46:13.687,00:46:15.564,"Just tell me where you are, honey."
00:46:20.360,00:46:21.737,Will!
00:46:25.532,00:46:31.538,"Where are you? Where are you? Just talk to me-- Oh, no, no!"
00:46:31.622,00:46:32.664,No!
00:46:32.748,00:46:34.249,No!
00:46:39.922,00:46:41.215,No!
00:47:05.697,00:47:07.074,Jonathan?
00:47:55.622,00:47:57.207,Will...
00:48:31.908,00:48:34.036,"Oh, my God..."
00:49:20.207,00:49:24.503,"Hmm... well, I hear his mom's room has a fireplace."
00:49:25.921,00:49:28.256,"Okay, well, you know, you are cleaning the sheets."
00:49:28.340,00:49:29.591,-You all right? -Yeah.
00:49:29.675,00:49:32.344,"Yeah? Come on, let's get you some dry clothes."
00:49:39.309,00:49:40.602,Nancy.
00:49:41.561,00:49:43.313,Where are you going?
00:49:43.397,00:49:44.439,Nowhere.
00:49:44.523,00:49:46.358,Just... upstairs.
00:49:46.441,00:49:48.068,To change.
00:49:53.657,00:49:55.534,Why don't you go ahead and go home.
00:49:55.617,00:49:57.994,I'll just... I'll get a ride or something.
00:49:58.078,00:49:59.454,Nance...
00:50:00.205,00:50:01.915,Barb...
00:50:01.998,00:50:03.583,I'm fine.
00:50:03.667,00:50:06.086,This isn't you.
00:50:07.212,00:50:08.839,I'm fine.
00:50:08.922,00:50:12.509,"Just... go ahead and go home, okay?"
00:50:32.404,00:50:33.655,Thanks.
00:50:38.452,00:50:39.995,Um...
00:50:40.078,00:50:41.705,"some privacy, maybe?"
00:50:49.755,00:50:50.797,Steve?
00:51:04.811,00:51:05.979,Damn.
00:51:08.315,00:51:09.566,Shut up.
00:00:23.189,00:00:24.357,Hello?
00:00:28.319,00:00:29.529,Nancy?
00:00:32.323,00:00:33.616,Nancy!
00:00:56.639,00:00:58.141,Nancy!
00:01:01.978,00:01:03.354,"Hey, what's the matter?"
00:01:04.773,00:01:06.441,Nothing.
00:01:35.220,00:01:36.596,You're so beautiful.
00:03:26.247,00:03:27.498,Steve?
00:03:30.376,00:03:32.503,"-Hey, Steve. -Mmm."
00:03:37.675,00:03:39.302,"see you tomorrow, okay?"
00:03:41.429,00:03:42.430,Mmm-hmm.
00:04:16.798,00:04:18.633,"Oh! Jesus, you scared me."
00:04:18.716,00:04:19.884,"Oh, I scared you?"
00:04:19.968,00:04:21.177,"I know, I should have called."
00:04:24.472,00:04:27.433,"After the assembly, some people wanted to get something to eat."
00:04:27.517,00:04:28.518,I didn't think it'd be a big deal.
00:04:28.601,00:04:30.770,You didn't think to call and let me know?
00:04:30.853,00:04:32.522,With everything that's been going on?
00:04:32.605,00:04:35.358,"I didn't realize how late it was, okay?"
00:04:35.441,00:04:37.193,"I'm sorry, Mom. What more do you want?"
00:04:37.277,00:04:38.569,"Hey, wait..."
00:04:38.653,00:04:39.821,Whose sweatshirt is that?
00:04:41.572,00:04:42.573,Steve's.
00:04:42.657,00:04:44.367,Steve's.
00:04:45.535,00:04:46.703,So is Steve your boyfriend now?
00:04:46.786,00:04:48.079,What?
00:04:48.162,00:04:49.163,No!
00:04:49.247,00:04:52.292,"It was just cold, so I borrowed his sweatshirt."
00:04:52.375,00:04:53.626,It's not a big deal.
00:04:54.627,00:04:55.878,Nancy?
00:04:55.962,00:04:57.547,What?
00:04:59.048,00:05:01.009,You can talk to me.
00:05:01.092,00:05:03.970,You can talk to me. Whatever happened.
00:05:04.053,00:05:06.764,Nothing happened.
00:05:09.225,00:05:10.768,Nancy.
00:05:12.687,00:05:14.689,Nothing happened.
00:05:16.649,00:05:18.151,Can I please go?
00:05:46.512,00:05:48.765,"Sweetheart, can you hear me?"
00:05:48.848,00:05:49.849,Will...
00:05:49.932,00:05:51.184,Please...
00:05:51.267,00:05:52.894,Will...
00:05:54.937,00:05:55.980,It's me.
00:05:56.898,00:05:59.567,It's me. Just talk to me. Talk to me.
00:06:01.736,00:06:03.905,-Mom? -Jonathan!
00:06:09.577,00:06:11.913,"-What's going on? -It's Will. It's Will, he's..."
00:06:11.996,00:06:13.831,he's trying to talk to me.
00:06:15.875,00:06:19.003,"-He's trying to talk to you? -Yes, through... through the lights."
00:06:19.087,00:06:20.213,-Mom-- -I know.
00:06:20.296,00:06:21.672,I know.
00:06:21.756,00:06:23.883,Just... just watch.
00:06:23.966,00:06:27.553,Will... your brother's here.
00:06:29.013,00:06:31.432,"Can you show him what you showed me, baby?"
00:06:35.394,00:06:37.355,"It's the electricity, Mom."
00:06:38.773,00:06:40.358,It's the same thing that fried the phone.
00:06:40.441,00:06:42.985,"No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan."
00:06:43.069,00:06:45.279,Something is going on here!
00:06:45.363,00:06:47.990,"-Yesterday, the wall-- -What? What about the wall?"
00:06:48.074,00:06:50.243,"-I don't know. I don't know. -Mom, first the lights, then the wall?"
00:06:57.125,00:07:01.546,"You don't need more lamps. You need to stop this, okay?"
00:07:01.629,00:07:03.798,He is just lost.
00:07:03.881,00:07:07.969,"People are looking for him, and they're going to find him."
00:07:09.720,00:07:11.931,"-This isn't helping. -Okay, okay."
00:07:15.101,00:07:16.644,"Can you do me a favor, Mom?"
00:07:16.727,00:07:18.479,Can you just try and get some sleep?
00:07:21.315,00:07:22.567,-I promise. I will. -Yeah?
00:07:22.650,00:07:24.610,-Yeah. -I just need to sit here for a minute.
00:07:25.778,00:07:27.572,"All right, I'll go make breakfast."
00:07:27.655,00:07:29.157,-Okay. -Yeah?
00:07:44.380,00:07:46.841,We just tell our parents we have AV Club after school.
00:07:46.924,00:07:49.510,That'll give us at least a few hours for Operation Mirkwood.
00:07:50.553,00:07:53.139,You seriously think that the weirdo knows where Will is?
00:07:53.222,00:07:54.932,"-Just trust me on this, okay? -Okay."
00:07:55.016,00:07:56.517,-Did you get the supplies? -Yeah.
00:07:56.601,00:07:59.228,Binoculars... from 'Nam.
00:07:59.312,00:08:01.481,Army knife... also from 'Nam.
00:08:01.564,00:08:04.025,"Hammer, camouflage bandana..."
00:08:04.108,00:08:06.277,and the wrist rocket.
00:08:06.360,00:08:08.362,You're gonna take out the Demogorgon with a slingshot?
00:08:08.446,00:08:10.907,"First of all, it's a wrist rocket."
00:08:10.990,00:08:13.326,"And second of all, the Demogorgon's not real."
00:08:13.409,00:08:14.410,It's made up.
00:08:14.494,00:08:17.747,"But if there is something out there, I'm gonna shoot it in the eye..."
00:08:25.421,00:08:26.589,"Well, alrighty."
00:08:26.672,00:08:27.924,"So, we've got..."
00:08:28.007,00:08:36.265,"Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties, Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple, -banana, and trail mix. -Seriously?"
00:08:36.349,00:08:38.851,We need energy for our travels. For stamina.
00:08:38.935,00:08:41.062,"And besides, why do we even need weapons anyway?"
00:08:43.856,00:08:45.024,With her mind!
00:08:45.107,00:08:47.777,Are you kidding me? That's insane!
00:08:47.860,00:08:50.738,Imagine all the other cool stuff she could do.
00:08:50.821,00:08:51.906,Like...
00:08:52.782,00:08:56.452,I bet... that she could make this fly!
00:08:58.788,00:09:00.164,Hey. Hey.
00:09:00.248,00:09:01.832,"Okay, concentrate. Okay?"
00:09:03.834,00:09:05.211,"Okay, one more time."
00:09:08.631,00:09:10.341,"Use your powers, okay?"
00:09:15.263,00:09:17.014,Time for school!
00:09:19.183,00:09:20.226,Just stay down here.
00:09:20.309,00:09:22.562,"Don't make any noise, and don't leave."
00:09:22.687,00:09:25.106,"If you get hungry, eat Dustin's snacks, okay?"
00:09:27.149,00:09:28.526,You know those power lines?
00:09:28.609,00:09:30.403,-Power lines? -Yeah.
00:09:30.486,00:09:31.529,The ones behind my house?
00:09:31.612,00:09:32.822,Yes.
00:09:32.905,00:09:34.448,"Meet us there, after school."
00:09:36.284,00:09:37.618,"Yeah, 3:15."
00:09:39.745,00:09:40.830,Ah.
00:09:46.711,00:09:49.505,"When the numbers read three-one-five, meet us there."
00:09:49.589,00:09:51.799,Three-one-five.
00:09:51.882,00:09:53.843,Three-one-five.
00:10:20.119,00:10:21.412,Hey!
00:10:23.539,00:10:25.166,-Is everything okay? -Yeah!
00:10:25.249,00:10:26.709,"Yeah, totally."
00:10:27.710,00:10:28.794,I just...
00:10:30.421,00:10:33.215,I feel like everyone's... staring at me.
00:10:33.299,00:10:34.800,"Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone."
00:10:34.884,00:10:36.135,I know.
00:10:36.218,00:10:38.054,I know. Of course not.
00:10:38.763,00:10:41.682,"But what about, like, Tommy, and Carol and them?"
00:10:41.766,00:10:42.850,You're being paranoid.
00:10:43.851,00:10:46.312,"-I'm sorry. -No. No, it's cute."
00:10:48.522,00:10:49.523,Hey...
00:10:49.607,00:10:51.275,I had a good time.
00:10:53.152,00:10:54.320,Yeah.
00:10:55.613,00:10:57.114,"Yeah. Me, too."
00:11:09.669,00:11:11.087,Mmm. Hmm.
00:11:27.686,00:11:29.563,"Hey, Ally. Where's Barb?"
00:11:29.647,00:11:31.482,"Um, shouldn't you know?"
00:11:31.565,00:11:33.734,You haven't seen her anywhere... at all?
00:11:47.581,00:11:50.251,I guess we're gonna blow the Ruskies to smithereens.
00:11:53.629,00:11:55.631,"Uh, yeah. We're here for a tour."
00:11:55.714,00:11:57.508,"Oh, we don't give tours."
00:11:57.591,00:11:59.635,Okay... A quick look around.
00:11:59.718,00:12:02.346,"You have to get clearance for that. You can contact, uh..."
00:12:02.430,00:12:04.014,Rick Schaeffer at the Department of Energy.
00:12:04.098,00:12:06.183,Maybe you seen it on TV. We got a local kid that's missing.
00:12:06.267,00:12:08.102,We have reason to believe he might have snuck in here.
00:12:08.185,00:12:10.646,"Like I said, you have to speak to Mr. Schaeffer."
00:12:13.107,00:12:14.942,-What's your name? -Patrick.
00:12:15.025,00:12:20.281,"Patrick, I got a panicked mayor, and I got reporters breathing down my neck and I got a very upset mother."
00:12:21.699,00:12:25.870,"Now, I know the kid's not in there, but I gotta check off this box."
00:12:27.788,00:12:30.166,"Patrick, would you do me a favor?"
00:12:30.249,00:12:33.794,Would you speak to your boss and see what you can swing for us?
00:12:35.045,00:12:36.380,I'd really appreciate it.
00:12:37.339,00:12:39.341,"I'm talking ten minutes, tops."
00:13:52.581,00:16:42.501,"Today, Syria has become a home for-- From the Harmony Treasures' collection-- And you think this missing boy may have crawled through there?"
00:16:45.295,00:16:47.715,"Yeah, I just don't see how that'd be possible."
00:16:47.798,00:16:49.508,We've got over 100 cameras.
00:16:49.591,00:16:52.219,"Every square inch covered, plus all my guys."
00:16:52.928,00:16:54.388,No one breaks in here.
00:16:54.471,00:16:56.098,Certainly not some kid.
00:16:56.181,00:16:58.600,"Those cameras, you keep the tapes?"
00:17:08.485,00:17:12.531,-Staying one step ahead of the Russians? -I expect. Something like that.
00:17:12.614,00:17:15.034,-Who's in charge here? -That'd be Dr. Brenner.
00:17:15.117,00:17:16.994,And he builds the space lasers?
00:17:17.077,00:17:18.912,-Space lasers? -Ignore him.
00:17:21.790,00:17:24.001,This is the night of the 6th and 7th we're seeing here?
00:17:24.084,00:17:25.419,That's correct.
00:17:37.347,00:17:38.557,Is that it?
00:17:39.600,00:17:41.560,"Like I said, we would have seen him."
00:17:44.605,00:17:47.024,"The night of the 7th, we had a search party out for Will."
00:17:47.107,00:17:48.817,You remember anything about that night?
00:17:48.901,00:17:51.153,"Mmm, not much to remember. Called it off."
00:17:51.236,00:17:53.822,"-'Cause of the storm. -Yeah, a lot of rain that night."
00:17:53.906,00:17:55.574,You see any rain on that tape?
00:17:59.536,00:18:00.829,I don't know.
00:18:02.790,00:18:04.041,But they're lying.
00:20:54.461,00:20:56.296,"Well, if it's not frostbite, then what is it?"
00:20:56.380,00:20:58.215,"Ugh, I don't care what it is, it's disgusting!"
00:20:58.298,00:21:00.008,Get it off the table. We're eating here.
00:21:02.302,00:21:04.096,"Hey, Tommy."
00:21:04.179,00:21:06.056,"When you left, did you see Barb?"
00:21:06.139,00:21:08.558,-What? -Barbara.
00:21:08.642,00:21:10.102,She's not here today.
00:21:10.185,00:21:13.313,I seriously have no idea who you're talking about.
00:21:13.397,00:21:15.565,"Come on, don't be an ass, man. Did you..."
00:21:15.649,00:21:17.484,Did you see her leave last night or not?
00:21:18.360,00:21:21.196,"No, she was gone when we left."
00:21:21.280,00:21:23.740,Probably couldn't stand listening to all that moaning.
00:21:27.744,00:21:31.164,"-Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve! -Oh, Steve..."
00:21:35.085,00:21:39.006,Listen... I'm sure she's fine. She's probably just...
00:21:39.089,00:21:41.591,"she's probably just, like, skipping or something."
00:21:41.675,00:21:43.093,Yeah.
00:21:43.176,00:21:44.761,"Yeah, probably."
00:22:06.366,00:22:12.789,"So, do you think Eleven was born with her powers, like the X-Men, or do you think she acquired them, like... like Green Lantern?"
00:22:12.873,00:22:16.001,She's not a superhero. She's a weirdo.
00:22:16.084,00:22:18.503,Why does that matter? The X-Men are weirdos.
00:22:18.587,00:22:21.048,"If you love her so much, why don't you marry her?"
00:22:21.131,00:22:22.466,What are you talking about?
00:22:22.549,00:22:24.051,"-Mike, seriously? -What?"
00:22:24.134,00:22:26.178,"You look at her all, like..."
00:22:26.261,00:22:28.722,"Hi, El! El! El! El!"
00:22:28.805,00:22:30.182,I love you so much!
00:22:32.184,00:22:33.685,"Yeah, shut up, Lucas."
00:22:34.436,00:22:36.521,What are you losers doing back here?
00:22:36.605,00:22:38.148,Probably looking for their missing friend.
00:22:38.231,00:22:41.151,That's not funny. It's serious. He's in danger.
00:22:41.234,00:22:44.404,"I hate to break it to you, Toothless, but he's not in danger."
00:22:44.488,00:22:46.865,He's dead. That's what my dad says.
00:22:46.948,00:22:49.242,He said he was probably killed by some other queer.
00:22:50.660,00:22:52.412,Come on. Just ignore them.
00:22:57.167,00:22:59.294,"Watch where you're going, Frogface."
00:23:00.837,00:23:02.631,-You all right? -Yeah.
00:23:08.261,00:23:09.930,Hey.
00:23:10.013,00:23:11.515,How about this one?
00:23:15.185,00:23:16.603,"Yeah, this is it."
00:23:16.686,00:23:18.605,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:21.149,00:23:22.192,Whoo!
00:23:48.426,00:23:49.427,Hey.
00:23:50.637,00:23:52.139,"Oh, hey."
00:24:33.346,00:24:35.265,"-Hey! -Hey, Karen."
00:24:35.348,00:24:36.349,Hi...
00:24:38.935,00:24:39.978,I brought you a casserole.
00:24:41.188,00:24:43.190,"Oh! Thank you, uh..."
00:24:44.232,00:24:46.818,"Uh, you wanna... come in?"
00:25:03.043,00:25:06.171,"Hey, Marissa. How you doin'?"
00:25:07.631,00:25:09.633,You have a lot of nerve showing up here.
00:25:09.716,00:25:11.051,What?
00:25:11.134,00:25:17.682,"You could have at least called, said, Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out. Sorry I wasted your time. I'm a dick."
00:25:19.142,00:25:20.268,Yep.
00:25:22.938,00:25:25.315,I'm sorry. Uh...
00:25:25.398,00:25:27.776,Maybe we could go out again next week?
00:25:32.906,00:25:35.408,Newspapers? You guys got newspapers around here?
00:25:36.076,00:25:38.912,"We have the New York Times, the Post, all the big ones."
00:25:38.995,00:25:40.538,Organized by year and topic.
00:25:40.622,00:25:43.333,You can find the corresponding microfiche in the reading room.
00:25:43.416,00:25:46.211,"Okay, we're looking for anything on the Hawkins National Laboratory."
00:25:48.129,00:25:50.298,Yeah. We are.
00:25:51.466,00:25:54.844,"Uh, so, why don't you start with the Times, and we'll check out the Post."
00:26:03.812,00:26:05.397,The librarian?
00:26:52.986,00:26:55.280,So I thought if I... I put the lights up...
00:26:56.281,00:26:57.949,"I don't know, he..."
00:27:01.369,00:27:04.414,"No. No, it's not silly."
00:27:04.497,00:27:06.499,How is Jonathan holding up?
00:27:09.627,00:27:11.588,"He always has been, you know?"
00:27:11.671,00:27:12.922,I...
00:27:18.470,00:27:19.804,Is something the matter?
00:27:19.888,00:27:21.222,"Uh, no."
00:27:21.306,00:27:22.557,"No, I just..."
00:27:22.640,00:27:24.851,We're having electrical problems.
00:27:24.934,00:27:26.061,Joyce.
00:27:26.644,00:27:28.563,I want you to know something.
00:27:28.646,00:27:31.775,"If you need anything, anything at all..."
00:27:31.858,00:27:33.401,Ted and I are here for you.
00:27:35.612,00:27:36.905,Okay.
00:27:39.824,00:27:41.618,"Is he, uh, okay?"
00:27:44.746,00:27:46.289,He skipped school yesterday.
00:28:33.628,00:28:35.130,"Oh, where's Holly?"
00:28:50.019,00:28:51.187,She shouldn't be here.
00:28:51.271,00:28:54.774,"Oh, I'm sorry. She's quite the explorer these days."
00:28:55.817,00:28:58.111,"-Wait, did you see something? -Yeah."
00:28:58.194,00:28:59.863,What did... what did you see? Tell me.
00:28:59.946,00:29:01.823,-What did you see? What-- -Joyce... Joyce!
00:29:01.906,00:29:07.120,"Listen... Karen, thank you for the casserole, but I need you to leave."
00:29:07.787,00:29:08.913,Okay?
00:29:16.629,00:29:18.506,"Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy."
00:29:18.590,00:29:19.966,"Oh, Nancy, how are you?"
00:29:20.049,00:29:21.092,Good. I'm good.
00:29:21.176,00:29:24.387,"Um, I was just wondering, uh, is Barb there?"
00:29:24.471,00:29:26.431,"Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet."
00:29:27.515,00:29:29.893,"But she did come home, right? After the vigil?"
00:29:29.976,00:29:33.229,"No, she said she was staying with you last night."
00:29:33.313,00:29:37.108,"Right, yes. She did, sorry."
00:29:37.192,00:29:40.361,"I meant, did she come home this morning?"
00:29:40.445,00:29:43.615,I think she left some textbooks and she was gonna go pick them up.
00:29:43.698,00:29:45.909,"Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her."
00:29:46.951,00:29:50.914,Do-- Do you know what? I just remembered... she's at the library.
00:29:50.997,00:29:54.626,"Nancy, will you please have her call me as soon as you find her?"
00:29:54.709,00:29:56.669,"Yeah. Yeah, I will."
00:29:57.879,00:29:59.088,Sorry to bother you.
00:30:12.435,00:30:14.145,"Hey, man."
00:30:14.229,00:30:15.271,What's going on?
00:30:15.355,00:30:17.357,"Nicole here was, uh, telling us about your work."
00:30:19.818,00:30:23.530,"And we'd just love to take a look. You know, as... connoisseurs of art."
00:30:26.950,00:30:29.160,"Please, give me my bag. No, just..."
00:30:29.244,00:30:31.704,"Man, he is totally trembling. He must really have something to hide."
00:30:31.788,00:30:33.039,Here we go.
00:30:33.122,00:30:34.833,Ah...
00:30:34.916,00:30:35.917,Here we go.
00:30:40.547,00:30:41.548,Dude.
00:30:46.344,00:30:49.097,"No, this is called stalking. Mmm-hmm."
00:30:49.722,00:30:52.433,-What's going on? -Here's the starring lady.
00:30:53.726,00:30:55.770,This creep was spying on us last night.
00:30:57.063,00:30:59.107,He was probably gonna save this one for later.
00:31:07.740,00:31:09.784,"Man, that's the thing about perverts..."
00:31:10.827,00:31:11.828,It's hardwired into 'em.
00:31:11.911,00:31:14.789,"You know, they just can't help themselves."
00:31:19.919,00:31:21.546,we'll just have to take away his toy.
00:31:22.088,00:31:23.756,"-Steve... -No, please, not the camera."
00:31:23.840,00:31:25.550,"No, no, wait, wait... Tommy, Tommy."
00:31:29.929,00:31:31.639,"Here you go, man."
00:31:36.269,00:31:38.521,"Come on, let's go. The game's about to start."
00:31:40.148,00:31:41.232,Boo.
00:32:01.252,00:32:02.503,Come on.
00:32:29.197,00:32:30.365,Three-one-five.
00:32:31.282,00:32:33.034,Three-one-five.
00:33:41.394,00:33:44.022,No! No!
00:33:44.105,00:33:46.399,Papa! Papa!
00:33:46.482,00:33:47.775,Papa!
00:33:47.859,00:33:49.944,Papa!
00:34:47.418,00:34:48.503,Incredible.
00:35:49.647,00:35:51.607,Hop on. We only have a few hours.
00:36:02.493,00:36:05.079,"So, I told Mr. Mundy..."
00:36:05.163,00:36:08.249,The solution of ten plus Y equals...
00:36:12.211,00:36:13.671,Saturday.
00:36:16.841,00:36:19.760,"Maybe you should blow him, Carol. Help your grades a bit."
00:36:21.679,00:36:22.805,"Whoa, Nance, where you going?"
00:36:25.516,00:36:27.101,"I told my mom I would, um..."
00:36:27.185,00:36:28.644,I would do something with her.
00:36:28.728,00:36:30.605,"Well, what do you mean? The game's about to start."
00:36:30.688,00:36:32.148,I'm sorry.
00:36:36.235,00:36:39.197,Maybe she freaked out when you went all psycho on the psycho.
00:36:39.280,00:36:40.281,"Oh, give me a break."
00:36:49.207,00:36:50.666,Why did they hurt you?
00:36:51.834,00:36:52.877,What?
00:36:56.547,00:36:57.548,Uh...
00:36:57.632,00:36:59.300,I just fell at recess.
00:37:00.801,00:37:02.428,-Mike... -Yeah?
00:37:02.511,00:37:03.971,Friends tell the truth.
00:37:07.183,00:37:10.019,"I was tripped by this mouth breather, Troy, okay?"
00:37:10.102,00:37:11.562,Mouth breather?
00:37:11.687,00:37:13.564,"Yeah, you know..."
00:37:13.648,00:37:14.774,a dumb person.
00:37:14.857,00:37:16.025,A knucklehead.
00:37:18.819,00:37:21.906,I don't know why I just didn't tell you. Everyone at school knows.
00:37:21.989,00:37:24.825,"I just didn't want you to think I was such a wastoid, you know?"
00:37:24.909,00:37:27.036,-Mike... -Yeah?
00:37:27.119,00:37:28.621,I understand.
00:37:29.538,00:37:30.957,Oh.
00:37:31.040,00:37:32.792,"Okay, cool."
00:37:32.875,00:37:34.085,Cool.
00:37:56.315,00:37:57.483,Barb?
00:37:59.652,00:38:00.987,Barb!
00:38:19.380,00:38:20.715,Barb?
00:38:31.350,00:38:32.727,Barb?
00:38:50.202,00:38:51.495,Barb?
00:38:53.497,00:38:54.498,Oh!
00:40:06.821,00:40:09.573,Will... are you here?
00:40:13.202,00:40:15.037,"Okay, good, good, good, good."
00:40:15.955,00:40:16.997,Are you...
00:40:17.081,00:40:21.127,"Um, blink once for yes, twice for no."
00:40:23.754,00:40:24.797,Can you do...
00:40:56.579,00:41:00.124,"I need to know where to find you, honey. Where... where are you?"
00:41:00.207,00:41:03.669,Can you... can you tell me where you are?
00:41:03.752,00:41:05.087,Can you...
00:41:16.807,00:41:18.142,Will...
00:41:44.877,00:41:47.296,Hey! You're home early! How was the game?
00:41:50.090,00:41:52.718,Nancy? What's the matter?
00:41:54.970,00:41:56.180,I think...
00:41:57.598,00:41:59.475,something happened.
00:42:05.981,00:42:07.233,What don't you know?
00:42:07.316,00:42:10.486,"This lady, Terry Ives, sounds like a real nut to me."
00:42:10.569,00:42:14.615,Her kid was taken for LSD mind control experiments?
00:42:14.698,00:42:15.783,She's been discredited.
00:42:17.034,00:42:18.160,"Okay, forget about her."
00:42:18.953,00:42:20.496,Take a look at this.
00:42:20.579,00:42:22.790,-Dr. Martin Brenner. -Who?
00:42:22.873,00:42:24.500,Brenner.
00:42:24.583,00:42:26.502,He runs Hawkins Lab.
00:42:26.585,00:42:27.628,Okay.
00:42:31.298,00:42:32.716,Not really.
00:42:32.800,00:42:35.678,"He was involved in some hippie crap back in the day, so what?"
00:42:35.761,00:42:39.932,"No, this isn't hippie crap. This is CIA-sanctioned research."
00:42:40.015,00:42:42.142,Doesn't mean he had anything to do with our kid.
00:42:42.226,00:42:45.229,Come on. Look at that. Hospital gowns. All of 'em.
00:42:45.312,00:42:47.523,"Now, that piece of fabric that the teacher found by the pipe."
00:42:47.606,00:42:49.525,"That sure looked like a hospital gown to me, huh?"
00:42:49.608,00:42:52.027,"-Am I wrong? -I don't know, Chief."
00:42:53.529,00:42:55.823,Work with me here.
00:42:55.906,00:42:58.492,I'm not saying that there's some grand conspiracy.
00:42:58.576,00:42:59.827,I'm just...
00:43:04.248,00:43:05.958,I'm saying maybe something happened.
00:43:07.042,00:43:12.881,Maybe Will was in the wrong place at the wrong time and he saw something that he shouldn't have.
00:43:14.091,00:43:16.635,-It's a reach. -It's a start.
00:43:20.014,00:43:21.557,Hopper here. What do you got?
00:44:06.268,00:44:08.812,"Yeah, this is where Will lives."
00:44:09.355,00:44:10.439,Hiding.
00:44:10.522,00:44:13.150,"No, no, this is where he lives."
00:44:13.233,00:44:15.235,He's missing from here. Understand?
00:44:20.866,00:44:22.576,Um... no!
00:44:22.660,00:44:26.914,"I swear, if we walked all the way out here for nothing-- That's exactly what we did."
00:44:26.997,00:44:30.042,I told you she didn't know what the hell she was talking about!
00:44:32.920,00:44:36.131,"-Mike, don't waste your time with her. -What do you want to do then?"
00:44:39.551,00:44:41.762,-What other choice do we have? -Guys!
00:45:09.915,00:45:10.999,Okay.
00:45:11.083,00:45:13.419,"Okay, baby, talk to me."
00:45:13.502,00:45:15.212,Talk to me. Where are you?
00:45:16.588,00:45:18.882,"R. Good, good, good, good."
00:45:18.966,00:45:20.342,"That's good. Come on, come on."
00:45:20.926,00:45:22.177,I...
00:45:22.886,00:45:24.388,G...
00:45:24.471,00:45:26.140,H... T...
00:45:26.849,00:45:28.100,H...
00:45:28.183,00:45:29.184,E...
00:45:29.309,00:45:31.311,R... E...
00:45:31.395,00:45:32.980,Right here.
00:45:33.981,00:45:35.107,Right here?
00:45:37.943,00:45:40.237,I need you to tell me what to do.
00:45:40.320,00:45:41.321,What should I do?
00:45:41.405,00:45:44.658,How do I get to you? How do I find you? What should I do?
00:47:01.026,00:47:03.403,"Oh, God. Please tell me it's not the kid."
00:47:31.390,00:47:34.351,It's not Will. It can't be.
00:47:42.901,00:47:45.487,It's Will. It's really Will.
00:47:55.747,00:47:57.874,You were supposed to help us find him alive.
00:47:57.958,00:47:59.376,You said he was alive!
00:47:59.459,00:48:00.877,Why did you lie to us?
00:48:01.670,00:48:03.171,What's wrong with you?
00:48:03.255,00:48:05.007,What is wrong with you?
00:48:10.679,00:48:13.223,"Mike, come on. Don't do this, man."
00:48:13.307,00:48:14.349,Mike...
00:48:14.433,00:48:17.102,"Mike, where are you going? Mike!"
00:48:41.752,00:48:42.919,Hey.
00:48:51.261,00:48:52.471,What's wrong?
00:00:50.300,00:00:53.094,water that's at the quarry.
00:00:53.178,00:00:56.431,Our working theory right now is that Will...
00:00:56.514,00:01:01.061,"crashed his bike, he... made his way over the quarry and, uh..."
00:01:01.144,00:01:03.104,accidentally fell in.
00:01:04.564,00:01:06.566,The earth must have given way.
00:01:10.403,00:01:11.738,Joyce?
00:01:15.283,00:01:16.951,Do you understand what I'm saying?
00:01:17.035,00:01:18.244,No.
00:01:22.540,00:01:24.042,is not my boy.
00:01:24.125,00:01:25.960,-It's not Will. -Joyce.
00:01:29.172,00:01:31.049,I talked to him...
00:01:31.132,00:01:32.550,a half hour ago.
00:01:35.804,00:01:38.097,He was... He was talking with these.
00:01:38.807,00:01:39.808,-Talking? -Uh-huh.
00:01:39.891,00:01:42.227,"One blink for yes, two for no."
00:01:42.894,00:01:44.813,"And... And, uh..."
00:01:49.859,00:01:52.195,'Cause he was hiding...
00:01:52.278,00:01:54.364,from that... that thing.
00:01:54.447,00:01:55.824,The thing that came out of the wall?
00:01:55.907,00:01:57.117,-The thing that chased you? -Yeah.
00:01:59.494,00:02:01.538,"-You've gotta stop this. -No, maybe he's..."
00:02:01.621,00:02:02.914,It's after him!
00:02:02.997,00:02:06.459,-He's in danger. We have to find him! We-- -What exactly was this thing?
00:02:06.543,00:02:07.919,"It was some kind of animal, you said?"
00:02:08.002,00:02:09.003,"Uh, no, it was..."
00:02:09.087,00:02:12.340,"It was almost... human, but it wasn't. It..."
00:02:12.423,00:02:16.469,It had these long arms and... it didn't have a face.
00:02:16.970,00:02:18.471,It didn't have a face?
00:02:22.058,00:02:23.351,"Joyce, listen to me."
00:02:23.434,00:02:24.894,Listen to me.
00:02:28.022,00:02:29.065,After Sarah...
00:02:33.153,00:02:34.237,And I heard her.
00:02:36.447,00:02:39.117,I didn't know what was real.
00:02:39.200,00:02:41.369,And then I figured out that it was in my mind.
00:02:41.452,00:02:43.496,And I had to pack all that away.
00:02:43.580,00:02:46.791,"Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole..."
00:02:46.875,00:02:48.668,that I couldn't get out of.
00:02:48.751,00:02:52.589,"No, you're... you're talking about grief."
00:02:52.672,00:02:53.923,This is different.
00:02:54.883,00:02:58.469,"-I'm just saying that you-- -No, I know what you're saying, Hop."
00:03:05.184,00:03:07.020,I'm not saying that you're crazy.
00:03:12.650,00:03:14.235,"God, I..."
00:03:14.319,00:03:16.905,I need you to believe me.
00:03:17.822,00:03:20.033,Please.
00:03:22.076,00:03:23.077,Listen...
00:03:25.622,00:03:28.458,I think you should go to the morgue tomorrow and see him for yourself.
00:03:28.541,00:03:30.418,It'll give you the answers that you need.
00:03:30.501,00:03:31.878,"-But tonight... -Oh, God."
00:03:31.961,00:03:34.631,"...I want you to try to get some sleep, if you can."
00:05:34.250,00:05:39.172,Byers' body was found in the water of this quarry by state police earlier this evening.
00:05:39.255,00:05:43.009,"It was discovered by state trooper David O'Bannon, just after dark."
00:05:43.092,00:05:48.431,"The state police are mounting an investigation to determine Byers' cause of death, but an initial inquiry..."
00:05:53.519,00:05:55.313,Give him time.
00:05:55.396,00:05:57.148,He'll come to us when he's ready.
00:06:14.540,00:06:16.667,Can you please stop that?
00:06:22.090,00:06:23.424,Are you deaf?
00:06:24.717,00:06:26.677,"I thought we were friends, you know?"
00:06:26.761,00:06:28.596,But friends tell each other the truth.
00:06:28.679,00:06:30.306,And they definitely don't lie to each other.
00:06:30.389,00:06:35.269,"You made me think Will was okay, that he was still out there, but he wasn't. He wasn't!"
00:06:36.229,00:06:39.357,"Maybe you thought you were helping, but you weren't."
00:06:39.440,00:06:42.652,You hurt me. Do you understand?
00:06:43.152,00:06:44.987,What you did sucks.
00:06:46.864,00:06:48.741,Lucas was right about you.
00:06:49.534,00:06:50.743,All along.
00:07:20.481,00:07:23.025,"Will, is that you? It's Mike! Do you copy?"
00:07:23.109,00:07:24.235,Over.
00:07:36.205,00:07:37.748,Was that...
00:07:37.832,00:07:38.875,Was it...
00:07:42.628,00:07:43.838,Will.
00:09:08.756,00:09:10.174,Mom! Wake up.
00:09:12.385,00:09:15.054,It's almost 8:00. We have to go.
00:09:15.137,00:09:17.473,Go where? Where?
00:09:18.307,00:09:19.725,To see Will.
00:09:26.232,00:09:29.026,"Hi, honey. How are you feeling?"
00:09:32.738,00:09:34.657,I don't think I can go to school today.
00:09:34.740,00:09:36.450,"Oh, that's fine, sweetie."
00:09:36.534,00:09:39.787,"I need to drop off Nance, then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents."
00:09:39.870,00:09:42.206,Why don't you grab a book or something and come with me?
00:09:42.290,00:09:46.752,"We can stop by the video store on the way back, pick out whatever you want. Even R-rated."
00:09:46.836,00:09:49.589,I think I just want to stay home today.
00:09:49.672,00:09:51.132,"I mean, if that's okay?"
00:09:51.215,00:09:54.510,"Well, are you sure you're gonna be all right here by yourself?"
00:09:54.594,00:09:56.053,I think so.
00:09:59.098,00:10:01.434,"But if you need anything, call Dad at work."
00:10:06.314,00:10:07.356,Bye.
00:10:07.440,00:10:08.941,"Bye, sweetie."
00:10:14.572,00:10:15.781,"Lucas, do you copy?"
00:10:17.033,00:10:19.076,"Lucas, come on, I know you're there!"
00:10:19.160,00:10:20.870,This is urgent. I'm serious.
00:10:23.748,00:10:26.292,I'm not gonna stop until you answer.
00:10:26.375,00:10:27.793,Lucas.
00:10:27.877,00:10:29.337,Lucas!
00:10:29.420,00:10:31.213,"Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas..."
00:10:31.297,00:10:35.134,"Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas-- Go away, Mike."
00:10:35.217,00:10:38.220,"I'm not in the mood, all right? Over and out."
00:10:38.304,00:10:39.680,"No, not out."
00:10:39.764,00:10:42.224,"I'm not messing around, okay? This is about Will."
00:10:42.308,00:10:44.226,-Over. -What about Will?
00:10:45.227,00:10:46.729,You mean about his funeral? Over.
00:10:46.854,00:10:47.980,"No, not his funeral."
00:10:48.064,00:10:49.565,-Screw his funeral! -What?
00:10:49.649,00:10:51.942,Just get over here stat. And bring Dustin.
00:10:52.026,00:10:53.319,Over and out.
00:10:59.367,00:11:02.620,"Well, everything's been a bit chaotic around here without Gary."
00:11:05.581,00:11:07.750,"-Where's Gary? -Well, I thought you knew."
00:11:07.833,00:11:11.212,"Those men from State, they... they sent Gary home last night."
00:11:12.755,00:11:14.673,So who did the autopsy?
00:11:15.257,00:11:16.842,Someone from State.
00:11:42.952,00:11:45.830,He has a birth mark on his right arm.
00:11:45.913,00:11:47.623,"Can you show that to me, please?"
00:11:53.087,00:11:54.338,How's your mom doing?
00:11:57.758,00:11:59.009,I don't know.
00:12:00.594,00:12:03.472,"How long's this stuff been going on? With the lights and, uh..."
00:12:03.556,00:12:05.766,Will and the thing in the wall?
00:12:08.394,00:12:10.729,"Since the first phone call, I guess."
00:12:17.486,00:12:18.696,in the past.
00:12:20.281,00:12:21.699,But this...
00:12:23.159,00:12:24.410,I don't know.
00:12:29.123,00:12:31.208,I'm worried it could be...
00:12:32.793,00:12:34.211,"Ugh, I don't know."
00:12:38.674,00:12:40.092,She'll be okay.
00:12:41.177,00:12:42.511,We'll be okay.
00:12:45.848,00:12:47.266,My mom...
00:12:52.104,00:12:53.564,"Yeah, she is."
00:12:56.108,00:12:57.485,Hey.
00:12:59.028,00:13:00.279,She is.
00:13:04.575,00:13:06.118,"-Ma'am, I need you to sign! -I don't..."
00:13:06.202,00:13:09.997,"I don't know what you think that thing is in there, but that is not my son!"
00:13:10.080,00:13:11.832,"-Joyce, wait a second. -No!"
00:13:18.464,00:13:21.342,"So, wait a sec. I don't understand. You went back to my house?"
00:13:21.425,00:13:22.801,To look for Barb.
00:13:22.885,00:13:24.970,"Yeah, okay, but why didn't you just talk to me?"
00:13:25.054,00:13:26.680,That's crazy.
00:13:26.764,00:13:29.600,"I don't know, I... I was scared."
00:13:29.683,00:13:34.063,You seriously think you saw a guy in a mask just hanging out in my yard?
00:13:34.146,00:13:35.898,I don't think it was a mask.
00:13:35.981,00:13:37.775,But he had no face?
00:13:38.943,00:13:40.778,I don't know!
00:13:40.861,00:13:42.738,"I don't know, I just..."
00:13:42.821,00:13:45.407,I have a terrible feeling about this.
00:13:45.491,00:13:46.534,"Oh, this is bad."
00:13:46.617,00:13:48.160,This is really bad.
00:13:48.244,00:13:49.286,What?
00:13:50.204,00:13:51.247,The cops...
00:13:52.164,00:13:54.083,they're gonna want to talk to all of us now.
00:13:55.000,00:13:57.670,"Tommy, Carol, everybody who was at the party."
00:13:57.753,00:13:59.713,-So? -My parents are gonna murder me!
00:14:00.714,00:14:02.758,Are you serious right now?
00:14:02.841,00:14:04.927,You don't understand. My dad's a grade-A asshole.
00:14:05.010,00:14:08.514,Barb is missing! And you're worried about your dad?
00:14:08.597,00:14:11.934,"Okay, just... When you talk to the cops, just..."
00:14:12.017,00:14:13.936,don't mention the beers.
00:14:14.019,00:14:18.023,"It's just gonna get us both in trouble, and Barbara's got nothing to do with it, okay?"
00:14:22.152,00:14:24.154,-I can't believe you. -Nancy.
00:14:25.781,00:14:27.157,"Nancy, wait!"
00:14:28.617,00:14:30.077,Nancy!
00:14:35.624,00:14:37.585,"Mom, will you just get in, please?"
00:14:40.713,00:14:41.881,Mom.
00:14:43.632,00:14:44.717,Mom!
00:14:47.136,00:14:48.178,Mom.
00:14:48.262,00:14:50.639,"-Stop. -Just go home, Jonathan."
00:14:50.723,00:14:53.475,"No, this is not an okay time for you to shut down."
00:14:53.559,00:14:55.978,"-Shut down? What... -We have to deal with this, Mom."
00:14:56.061,00:14:57.771,We have to deal with the funeral!
00:14:57.855,00:14:59.315,The funeral?
00:15:02.401,00:15:04.445,"Okay, let me get this straight."
00:15:04.528,00:15:07.698,"Will, that's not his body, because he's in the lights, right?"
00:15:07.781,00:15:09.617,And there's a monster in the wall?
00:15:09.700,00:15:11.201,Do you even hear yourself?
00:15:12.161,00:15:14.204,I know it sounds crazy.
00:15:15.706,00:15:17.499,-Yeah. -You think I don't know that?
00:15:17.583,00:15:18.751,It is crazy!
00:15:18.834,00:15:20.669,"But I heard him, Jonathan."
00:15:20.753,00:15:22.421,He talked to me!
00:15:22.504,00:15:25.341,Will is... is calling to me!
00:15:25.424,00:15:29.303,"And he's out there, and he's alone, and he's scared, and I..."
00:15:29.386,00:15:31.347,I don't care if anyone believes me!
00:15:42.149,00:15:44.652,the rest of us are having a funeral for Will!
00:15:44.735,00:15:47.780,I'm not letting him sit in that freezer another day!
00:15:51.533,00:15:53.202,"All right, show's over."
00:15:55.204,00:15:56.246,What?
00:16:09.593,00:16:12.346,"We keep losing the signal, but you heard it, right?"
00:16:14.932,00:16:15.975,What?
00:16:16.058,00:16:18.852,"Mike, you obviously tapped into a baby monitor."
00:16:18.978,00:16:20.521,It's probably the Blackburns' next door.
00:16:20.604,00:16:22.398,"Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?"
00:16:22.481,00:16:23.774,-That was Will! -Mike...
00:16:23.857,00:16:26.068,"Lucas, you don't understand. He spoke last night."
00:16:26.151,00:16:27.361,Words!
00:16:27.444,00:16:30.197,He was singing that weird song he loves. Even El heard him!
00:16:30.280,00:16:33.826,"Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him, then I guess-- Are you sure you're on the right channel?"
00:16:33.909,00:16:34.910,I don't think it's about that.
00:16:34.994,00:16:38.664,"I think, somehow, she's channeling him."
00:16:39.248,00:16:41.417,-Like... like Professor X. -Yeah.
00:16:41.500,00:16:43.168,Are you actually believing this crap?
00:16:44.086,00:16:45.129,"I don't know, I mean..."
00:16:45.212,00:16:48.048,Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger?
00:16:48.132,00:16:50.342,He sounded a lot like that.
00:16:51.010,00:16:53.470,Did you guys not see what I saw?
00:16:53.554,00:16:55.806,They pulled Will's body out of the water.
00:16:55.889,00:16:57.433,He's dead!
00:16:59.768,00:17:02.229,"Well, maybe it's his ghost. Maybe he's haunting us."
00:17:02.312,00:17:03.981,-It's not his ghost. -So how do you know that?
00:17:04.064,00:17:05.733,-I just do! -Then what was in that water?
00:17:05.816,00:17:06.900,I don't know!
00:17:06.984,00:17:09.194,All I know is Will is alive.
00:17:09.278,00:17:10.738,Will is alive!
00:17:10.821,00:17:12.156,He's out there somewhere.
00:17:12.239,00:17:13.866,All we have to do is find him.
00:17:20.456,00:17:21.999,This isn't gonna work.
00:17:22.082,00:17:23.959,We need to get El to a stronger radio.
00:17:24.710,00:17:27.046,-Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack. -Yeah.
00:17:27.129,00:17:28.172,The Heathkit's at school.
00:17:28.255,00:17:32.509,There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo in there without anyone noticing.
00:18:20.265,00:18:21.558,Wow.
00:18:21.642,00:18:23.685,-She looks-- -Pretty.
00:18:25.813,00:18:27.106,Good.
00:18:27.189,00:18:28.482,You look pretty good.
00:18:47.751,00:18:48.961,Good.
00:19:33.505,00:19:34.840,Clear.
00:19:38.510,00:19:41.471,"-You boys hear me all right in there? -Loud and clear, Shepard."
00:19:42.389,00:19:44.266,"Good luck in there, son."
00:20:44.701,00:20:53.252,"The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress."
00:20:54.169,00:20:59.549,"And Kurtz's life was running swiftly, too-- Nancy Wheeler?"
00:20:59.633,00:21:01.510,"If you'll come with me, please?"
00:21:10.018,00:21:11.645,What exactly was it about?
00:21:16.775,00:21:18.819,Barb just wanted to leave.
00:21:18.902,00:21:21.029,"I didn't, so, I..."
00:21:22.823,00:21:24.658,I told her to just go home.
00:21:25.659,00:21:26.868,Then what?
00:21:27.995,00:21:31.665,Then I went upstairs to put on some dry clothes.
00:21:31.748,00:21:34.626,"And the next day, you went back and..."
00:21:34.710,00:21:36.128,"saw a bear, you're thinking?"
00:21:37.421,00:21:40.841,"I don't know what it was, but..."
00:21:40.924,00:21:42.134,I think...
00:21:43.260,00:21:46.221,I think maybe it took Barb.
00:21:46.305,00:21:48.598,-You need to check behind Steve's house-- -We did.
00:21:48.682,00:21:50.017,There's nothing there.
00:21:50.100,00:21:52.769,-There's no sign of a bear. -And no car.
00:21:54.104,00:21:58.567,"We figure that Barbara came back last night and then she took off, went somewhere else."
00:21:58.650,00:22:00.819,Has she ever talked to you about running off?
00:22:00.902,00:22:02.362,"Leaving town, maybe?"
00:22:02.446,00:22:03.572,No.
00:22:03.655,00:22:05.866,"No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever."
00:22:05.949,00:22:09.328,She wasn't maybe upset about the fact that you were spending time with this boy?
00:22:09.411,00:22:11.621,"Uh, Steve Harrington?"
00:22:11.705,00:22:13.332,What? No!
00:22:13.415,00:22:16.585,Maybe she was jealous because she saw you go up to Steve's room?
00:22:16.668,00:22:17.753,It wasn't like that.
00:22:17.836,00:22:18.962,Like what?
00:22:19.046,00:22:21.923,"Steve and me, we're... we're just friends."
00:22:22.007,00:22:23.759,We... we just talked.
00:22:23.842,00:22:27.888,Now was this before or after you changed out of your clothes?
00:22:34.936,00:22:37.147,"It was about six of 'em, I'd say."
00:22:37.230,00:22:38.482,They're all Staties?
00:22:38.565,00:22:39.566,"Yes, sir."
00:22:39.649,00:22:42.694,Never seen that many troopers come with a body before.
00:22:42.778,00:22:45.572,"They told you that they were gonna take care of the autopsy, huh?"
00:22:45.655,00:22:47.574,Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction. Kicked me out.
00:22:47.657,00:22:50.660,"Well, it all seemed a bit over the top to me, considering..."
00:22:50.744,00:22:52.579,Considering what?
00:22:52.662,00:22:55.791,Considering this was Will Byers and not John F. Kennedy.
00:23:03.924,00:23:06.426,"-Thanks for stopping by, Gary. -Sure thing."
00:23:06.510,00:23:12.682,"...let the people know that, uh, the troopers are on duty and you should be safe, because we think this is just an isolated incident."
00:23:38.250,00:23:40.836,"Okay, remember, if anyone sees us, look sad."
00:23:42.671,00:23:47.342,there will be an assembly to honor Will Byers in the gymnasium now.
00:23:47.425,00:23:49.261,Do not go to fourth period.
00:23:49.344,00:23:50.512,It's locked.
00:23:50.595,00:23:52.764,"-What? -Hey, do you think you can open it?"
00:23:52.848,00:23:54.558,With your powers?
00:23:54.641,00:23:56.101,Boys?
00:23:57.310,00:23:58.770,Assembly's about to start.
00:23:58.854,00:24:01.606,"We know. We're just, you know..."
00:24:01.690,00:24:03.483,Upset.
00:24:04.943,00:24:06.403,We need some alone time.
00:24:08.738,00:24:09.990,I get it. I do.
00:24:10.073,00:24:13.076,"I know how hard this is, but let's just be there for Will, huh?"
00:24:13.577,00:24:14.578,And then...
00:24:17.122,00:24:19.583,the Heathkit is all yours for the rest of the day.
00:24:19.666,00:24:21.084,What do you say?
00:24:25.714,00:24:28.592,"-Eleven-- -Eleanor! She's my, uh-- -Cousin. -Second cousin."
00:24:30.969,00:24:33.221,"Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle, Eleanor."
00:24:33.305,00:24:35.348,I wish you were here under better circumstances.
00:24:35.432,00:24:36.474,Thank you.
00:24:37.392,00:24:39.144,"Uh, where are you from exactly?"
00:24:40.437,00:24:43.398,Bad place-- -Sweden! -I have a lot of Swedish family.
00:24:44.983,00:24:47.569,Subzero.
00:24:49.029,00:24:50.113,-Shall we? -Yep!
00:24:52.991,00:24:56.828,it is important that we come together as a community.
00:25:02.209,00:25:03.627,Abort.
00:25:05.837,00:25:08.215,We come together to heal...
00:25:09.424,00:25:10.842,we come together to grieve...
00:25:12.344,00:25:14.888,-You lied to the police! -I didn't lie!
00:25:17.307,00:25:19.434,You and Steve were just talking?
00:25:20.852,00:25:23.104,Is that what you want to know? It doesn't matter!
00:25:23.188,00:25:26.524,-It does matter! -No! It is all bullshit!
00:25:26.608,00:25:28.818,It has nothing to do with Barb and she's missing.
00:25:28.902,00:25:30.779,And something terrible happened to her. I know it.
00:25:30.862,00:25:32.781,I know it!
00:25:32.864,00:25:34.908,And no one is listening to me!
00:25:34.991,00:25:36.534,"Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening."
00:25:36.618,00:25:39.329,-I'm listening to you-- -No! You're not!
00:25:39.412,00:25:41.414,Nancy... Nancy!
00:25:41.498,00:25:43.208,Just leave me alone!
00:27:19.346,00:27:20.847,Try him again.
00:27:21.681,00:27:23.558,"Shepard, come in. Confirm comm."
00:27:25.226,00:27:28.229,"Shepard, come in. Confirm comm."
00:27:33.651,00:27:35.528,Shepard. Where are you?
00:27:35.612,00:27:39.032,Can you describe to us what it is you see? Over.
00:27:42.077,00:27:45.580,"Everything's still here, but it's all eroded. Covered in blood..."
00:27:47.040,00:27:49.084,Shepard? Do you copy?
00:28:03.139,00:28:04.516,"Come on, come on! Faster!"
00:29:09.956,00:29:14.669,Will was an exceptional student and a wonderful friend to all of us.
00:29:14.753,00:29:20.258,It's impossible to express the hole his loss will leave in our community.
00:29:21.301,00:29:23.636,I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.
00:29:23.720,00:29:26.389,She's a local grief counselor from the church over in Jonesboro.
00:29:27.724,00:29:33.354,"But before she comes up here, I just want those of you who are having trouble dealing with this tragic loss..."
00:29:33.438,00:29:34.606,Look at these fakers.
00:29:35.523,00:29:37.442,They probably didn't even know his name till today.
00:30:08.640,00:30:10.975,Hey! Hey!
00:30:11.059,00:30:12.310,"Hey, Troy!"
00:30:12.393,00:30:13.561,"Hey, Troy!"
00:30:15.772,00:30:17.607,You... you think this is funny?
00:30:17.690,00:30:19.108,"What'd you say, Wheeler?"
00:30:21.820,00:30:23.947,And I think that's a real messed up thing to do.
00:30:24.030,00:30:26.074,"Didn't you listen to the counselor, Wheeler?"
00:30:26.157,00:30:27.784,Grief shows itself in funny ways.
00:30:31.955,00:30:33.915,"Will's in fairyland now, right?"
00:30:33.998,00:30:36.960,Flying around with all the other little fairies.
00:30:37.043,00:30:38.545,All happy and gay!
00:30:54.853,00:30:55.937,Dead!
00:31:23.464,00:31:25.091,Hey! What's going on here?
00:31:25.174,00:31:26.259,Oh.
00:31:26.342,00:31:28.428,Mike! Let's go!
00:31:36.477,00:31:40.481,It's made of soft wood with a crepe interior.
00:31:41.482,00:31:48.740,"Uh, now, I... I don't know what your budget is, but over here, we... we have copper and bronze."
00:31:57.540,00:31:58.583,Of course.
00:32:03.588,00:32:04.631,Hey.
00:32:05.381,00:32:06.424,Hey.
00:32:13.514,00:32:14.599,I just...
00:32:17.185,00:32:19.145,Can we talk for a second?
00:32:24.484,00:32:26.527,but I wasn't using the wide angle.
00:32:28.112,00:32:29.155,I don't know.
00:32:29.238,00:32:30.448,It's weird.
00:32:33.493,00:32:36.162,And you're sure you didn't see anyone else out there?
00:32:36.245,00:32:38.039,No.
00:32:38.122,00:32:40.583,"And she was there one second and then, um..."
00:32:41.668,00:32:43.211,gone.
00:32:43.294,00:32:44.921,I figured she bolted.
00:32:45.004,00:32:47.340,The cops think that she ran away.
00:32:49.717,00:32:51.344,But they don't know Barb.
00:32:51.427,00:32:54.013,And I went back to Steve's...
00:32:55.223,00:32:57.767,and I thought I...
00:32:57.850,00:32:59.644,saw something.
00:32:59.727,00:33:01.020,Some...
00:33:02.563,00:33:04.273,weird man or...
00:33:05.650,00:33:07.777,I don't know what it was.
00:33:12.490,00:33:14.158,I'm sorry.
00:33:14.242,00:33:18.162,I... I shouldn't have come here today. I'm...
00:33:18.871,00:33:20.081,I'm so sorry.
00:33:20.164,00:33:21.541,What'd he look like?
00:33:24.210,00:33:25.253,What?
00:33:25.336,00:33:27.588,This man you saw in the woods.
00:33:28.381,00:33:29.632,What'd he look like?
00:33:36.139,00:33:38.433,It was almost like he...
00:33:38.516,00:33:41.477,he didn't have-- Didn't have a face?
00:33:43.479,00:33:45.565,How did you know that?
00:33:59.912,00:34:01.247,"Aw, come on!"
00:34:03.082,00:34:04.667,"Another, please."
00:34:04.751,00:34:06.711,"And another for my, uh, friend here."
00:34:07.920,00:34:09.756,"Oh, thanks, man. Appreciate it."
00:34:09.839,00:34:12.425,"Yeah, that's all right. I'm, uh... I'm celebrating."
00:34:12.508,00:34:15.386,"My daughter, she won the spelling bee today."
00:34:16.721,00:34:17.722,Is that right?
00:34:17.805,00:34:19.307,"Yeah, that's right."
00:34:21.142,00:34:22.685,Odontalgia.
00:34:23.603,00:34:24.645,That was the word.
00:34:24.729,00:34:26.564,You know what it means?
00:34:26.647,00:34:29.108,It's a fancy name for a toothache.
00:34:31.527,00:34:35.073,"Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart. Don't know where she gets it from."
00:34:35.156,00:34:37.450,I've been tryin' to figure that out for years.
00:34:38.743,00:34:40.244,"Your daughter, she got a name?"
00:34:44.082,00:34:45.124,What?
00:34:45.208,00:34:47.752,Your daughter? What's her name?
00:34:49.420,00:34:50.505,Sarah.
00:34:51.881,00:34:53.007,Her name's Sarah.
00:34:55.468,00:34:56.511,To Sarah.
00:35:06.813,00:35:08.689,I recognize you.
00:35:08.773,00:35:10.024,Are you famous or somethin'?
00:35:10.942,00:35:14.403,"Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh... I found that Byers boy."
00:35:16.864,00:35:18.574,"So, you on that case or what?"
00:35:18.658,00:35:20.326,"I just saw him on patrol, you know?"
00:35:20.409,00:35:21.536,Dumb luck.
00:35:23.121,00:35:25.414,"So that quarry, that's, uh..."
00:35:25.498,00:35:27.917,"that's state-run, where they found the boy, huh?"
00:35:29.293,00:35:30.336,Yeah.
00:35:36.801,00:35:40.054,"'Cause, you know, I know for a fact that it's run by the Sattler Company."
00:35:40.138,00:35:43.975,"Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got a couple operational quarries up in Roane."
00:35:44.058,00:35:45.434,-Is that right? -Yeah.
00:35:46.310,00:35:47.562,That's right.
00:35:49.355,00:35:50.815,"So why are you lying to me, man?"
00:35:54.026,00:35:55.236,"What's your problem, bud?"
00:35:55.319,00:35:56.946,I don't have a problem.
00:35:57.864,00:35:59.490,I'm just a concerned citizen.
00:35:59.574,00:36:00.741,Yeah?
00:36:00.825,00:36:03.494,"Well, stick your nose someplace else."
00:36:03.578,00:36:04.871,The kid is dead.
00:36:04.954,00:36:06.122,End of story.
00:36:09.000,00:36:11.085,"Thanks for ruining the game, dick."
00:36:22.763,00:36:24.765,Who told you to be out there?
00:36:24.849,00:36:26.601,What were you doing out there?
00:36:27.685,00:36:30.104,I don't know! I don't know. They...
00:36:30.229,00:36:34.442,they just told me to call it in and not let anybody get too close.
00:36:34.525,00:36:36.152,Get close to what?
00:36:36.235,00:36:37.486,The body.
00:36:39.113,00:36:40.156,Who do you work for?
00:36:40.239,00:36:42.700,The NSA? Hawkins Lab?
00:36:45.703,00:36:47.580,-You're gonna get us both killed. -Who is that?
00:36:47.663,00:36:50.082,Hey! Hey!
00:37:09.018,00:37:11.687,Come on! Come on!
00:37:13.814,00:37:15.524,Talk to me!
00:37:15.608,00:37:17.902,I know you're here!
00:37:27.245,00:37:29.789,-Now what? -She'll find him.
00:37:29.872,00:37:30.998,"Right, El?"
00:37:42.802,00:37:44.136,Eleven?
00:37:46.222,00:37:47.765,Are you listening?
00:37:50.559,00:37:52.645,That man before you...
00:37:56.482,00:37:58.401,I need you to find him.
00:38:06.242,00:38:08.828,"No, I don't want you to hurt him."
00:38:10.413,00:38:12.456,I want you to listen to him.
00:38:16.210,00:38:17.837,-Listen? -Yes.
00:38:18.838,00:38:23.342,I want you to listen to what he says and repeat his words back to me.
00:38:24.677,00:38:27.930,Just like we used to with those old nursery rhymes.
00:38:28.014,00:38:29.432,Do you remember?
00:38:30.683,00:38:32.184,Hmm?
00:38:32.310,00:38:34.395,Do you think you can do that for me?
00:38:36.355,00:38:38.149,-Mmm-hmm. -Good.
00:38:59.920,00:39:00.921,Frigid.
00:39:01.756,00:39:02.882,Evolve.
00:39:04.008,00:39:05.051,Airplane.
00:39:06.052,00:39:07.303,Eleven?
00:39:08.429,00:39:10.056,Repeat the words.
00:39:16.937,00:39:18.981,Peninsula.
00:39:19.065,00:39:20.816,Game.
00:39:20.900,00:39:22.360,Enchantment.
00:39:23.277,00:39:24.445,Mouse.
00:39:25.613,00:39:26.781,Balloon.
00:39:27.490,00:39:28.616,She's doing it.
00:39:28.699,00:39:30.409,-She's finding him! -This is crazy.
00:39:30.493,00:39:32.286,Calm down. She just closed her eyes.
00:39:43.589,00:39:44.840,What is that?
00:40:08.364,00:40:09.657,No way!
00:40:12.743,00:40:14.078,Will!
00:40:14.912,00:40:16.080,Will!
00:40:18.165,00:40:19.208,Will...
00:40:20.626,00:40:21.669,Will!
00:40:23.170,00:40:25.589,I'm here! I'm here!
00:40:26.966,00:40:28.926,"-Will! -Will, it's us! Are you there?"
00:40:29.009,00:40:30.386,Can you hear us? We're here!
00:40:32.555,00:40:33.597,Why can't he hear us?
00:40:33.681,00:40:34.890,I don't know!
00:40:36.600,00:40:37.768,Baby...
00:40:37.852,00:40:40.646,"-Mom? -Oh, God. Will!"
00:40:45.734,00:40:46.777,Will...
00:40:49.071,00:40:50.406,"Mom, it's coming!"
00:40:50.489,00:40:52.700,Tell me where you are! How do I get to you?
00:40:59.331,00:41:00.541,Mom? Mom!
00:41:00.624,00:41:03.919,"Listen to me! I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay?"
00:41:04.003,00:41:05.838,"But right now, I need you to hide."
00:41:05.921,00:41:07.298,"Mom, please!"
00:41:44.627,00:41:45.711,Can you move?
00:41:48.881,00:41:50.132,"Here, help her up."
00:42:43.102,00:42:47.147,"Like, um, where it might have gone to, or..."
00:42:59.994,00:43:01.203,Not long.
00:43:03.622,00:43:06.083,Have you been...
00:43:06.166,00:43:08.002,doing this a while?
00:43:08.085,00:43:09.670,What?
00:43:09.753,00:43:11.005,Photography?
00:43:12.673,00:43:13.716,Yeah.
00:43:14.633,00:43:18.804,"I guess I'd rather observe people than, you know..."
00:43:19.722,00:43:20.931,Talk to them.
00:43:21.015,00:43:22.975,I know. It's weird.
00:43:23.058,00:43:24.059,No!
00:43:26.353,00:43:27.855,"It's just, sometimes..."
00:43:28.856,00:43:31.567,people don't really say what they're really thinking.
00:43:32.484,00:43:34.403,But you capture the right moment...
00:43:35.321,00:43:36.655,it says more.
00:43:39.033,00:43:40.743,What?
00:43:40.826,00:43:42.119,When you took my picture.
00:43:43.871,00:43:45.456,I shouldn't have taken that.
00:43:47.541,00:43:48.667,"I'm, uh..."
00:43:48.751,00:43:50.294,I'm sorry.
00:43:52.212,00:43:55.299,It's just-- That's it.
00:43:56.717,00:43:58.344,That's what I saw.
00:44:01.221,00:44:02.806,My mom...
00:44:02.890,00:44:06.685,I thought she was crazy 'cause she said...
00:44:06.769,00:44:09.521,that's not Will's body. That he's alive.
00:44:09.605,00:44:12.274,-And if he's alive-- -Then Barbara.
00:44:31.335,00:44:33.337,"-Hey, Patty! -Hey, uh, need something, Chief?"
00:44:33.420,00:44:35.923,"-Oh, you know, I forgot my hat. -Oh."
00:44:42.012,00:44:45.891,"Hey, I love that book. It's a nasty mutt."
00:44:45.974,00:44:47.017,"Hey, you can't be back here."
00:44:47.101,00:44:48.686,"Yeah, I just got off the line with O'Bannon."
00:44:48.769,00:44:50.729,He said that he needs to see you at the station.
00:44:50.813,00:44:52.898,-It's some emergency... -What the hell are you talking about?
00:44:52.981,00:44:54.108,I don't work with O'Bannon.
00:44:54.191,00:44:55.984,Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...
00:47:22.339,00:47:23.799,Babe...
00:47:23.882,00:47:25.217,"Jesus, the hell happened?"
00:47:27.761,00:47:28.929,Lonnie.
00:01:20.914,00:01:23.625,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:01:23.708,00:01:25.502,"Forgot all the cameras, bub?"
00:01:25.585,00:01:28.463,"Look, Dr. Brenner asked for me specifically. Okay?"
00:01:28.546,00:01:29.672,How else do you think I got in here?
00:01:31.466,00:01:32.592,What's your name again?
00:01:32.675,00:01:34.385,It's Jim Hopper.
00:01:34.469,00:01:36.179,Chief Jim Hopper.
00:01:45.855,00:01:47.440,Hey...
00:01:47.524,00:01:49.025,you mind if I borrow this one?
00:02:02.497,00:02:03.790,It'll calm your nerves.
00:02:05.250,00:02:07.127,"Help you think straight, yeah?"
00:02:11.881,00:02:13.758,I don't know what to do.
00:02:15.135,00:02:16.594,I know. I know.
00:02:22.058,00:02:25.603,I... I could... I could feel him.
00:02:25.687,00:02:26.980,He was...
00:02:27.897,00:02:30.066,He was so close. He was... he was right there.
00:02:32.986,00:02:37.782,Our hands... our hands were almost touching.
00:02:37.866,00:02:40.869,Now it's like I... uh...
00:02:46.916,00:02:49.294,-Don't look at me like that. -Like what?
00:02:49.377,00:02:51.421,Like how everybody is looking at me.
00:02:51.504,00:02:53.423,-Like I'm out of my damn mind. -Hey.
00:02:56.342,00:03:01.097,"You're not gonna like this, but I think you need to seriously consider the possibility that all this..."
00:03:03.433,00:03:04.475,It's in your head.
00:03:06.978,00:03:08.980,-You remember your Aunt Darlene? -No.
00:03:09.063,00:03:12.025,"No, this is not that."
00:03:12.108,00:03:16.446,"I mean, when something like this happens, your mind makes up stuff for you to cope, you know?"
00:03:17.697,00:03:21.951,"I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral tomorrow for our little boy and you're saying his body is fake."
00:03:23.202,00:03:24.495,He's in the wall.
00:03:25.204,00:03:27.165,"I mean, how do you explain that?"
00:03:35.465,00:03:38.509,"-What about Pastor Charles or someone-- -I don't-- Well, they can't help."
00:03:38.593,00:03:40.470,"Joyce, you just told me..."
00:03:41.387,00:03:42.805,that Will is gone.
00:03:51.231,00:03:52.398,Hey.
00:04:09.457,00:04:10.625,Will?
00:04:12.919,00:04:14.295,Will?
00:04:16.297,00:04:17.465,Will?
00:04:43.992,00:04:45.451,but dark?
00:04:53.418,00:04:56.504,I don't know. The stupid radio kept going in and out.
00:04:58.089,00:04:59.966,Like home. Like his house?
00:05:00.049,00:05:01.301,Or maybe like Hawkins.
00:05:01.384,00:05:02.927,Upside down.
00:05:03.011,00:05:05.263,-What'd she say? -Upside down.
00:05:07.890,00:05:11.769,"When El showed us where Will was, she flipped the board over, remember?"
00:05:11.853,00:05:13.813,Upside down.
00:05:13.896,00:05:15.523,Dark. Empty.
00:05:15.606,00:05:17.942,Do you understand what he's talking about?
00:05:20.028,00:05:23.072,"When El took us to find Will, she took us to his house, right?"
00:05:23.156,00:05:24.949,Yeah. And he wasn't there.
00:05:25.033,00:05:26.743,But what if he was there?
00:05:26.826,00:05:28.786,What if we just couldn't see him?
00:05:28.870,00:05:30.830,What if he was on the other side?
00:05:32.040,00:05:35.084,What if this is Hawkins and...
00:05:36.544,00:05:37.754,this is where Will is?
00:05:37.837,00:05:39.464,The Upside Down.
00:05:39.547,00:05:41.257,Like the Vale of Shadows.
00:05:51.434,00:05:52.602,Will?
00:06:08.242,00:06:10.286,I see him! Hey! Stop!
00:06:18.336,00:06:22.590,is a dimension that is a dark reflection or echo of our world.
00:06:28.346,00:06:31.641,It is a place of decay and death.
00:06:33.142,00:06:37.021,A plane out of phase. A place of monsters.
00:06:39.440,00:06:41.859,"It is right next to you, and you don't even see it."
00:06:46.155,00:06:47.490,Will?
00:06:47.573,00:06:49.575,An alternate dimension.
00:06:50.576,00:06:52.495,But... how... how do we get there?
00:06:52.578,00:06:53.621,You cast Shadow Walk.
00:06:53.704,00:06:54.997,"In real life, dummy."
00:06:55.081,00:06:57.083,"We can't shadow walk, but..."
00:06:58.042,00:06:59.460,maybe she can.
00:07:01.254,00:07:03.923,Do you know how we get there? To the Upside Down?
00:07:23.151,00:07:24.569,What the hell?
00:08:09.989,00:08:11.282,Hey! Hey!
00:09:28.901,00:09:30.528,"Hey, kid."
00:09:30.611,00:09:32.405,What's going on?
00:09:38.786,00:09:40.580,How are you holding up?
00:09:44.166,00:09:45.334,What happened?
00:09:45.418,00:09:47.044,-Don't worry about that. -Mom...
00:09:47.795,00:09:50.756,"that thing you saw before, did it come back?"
00:09:50.840,00:09:53.551,"Jonathan, that's enough."
00:09:55.428,00:09:57.054,Can we talk?
00:09:57.138,00:09:58.306,Alone?
00:09:59.140,00:10:01.350,"-You need to leave. -Look, I know you're upset."
00:10:01.434,00:10:03.019,We all are.
00:10:03.102,00:10:07.189,But you need to listen to me. Your mother is sick. Really sick.
00:10:07.273,00:10:10.067,"Yeah. Well, you being here, you're just making things worse, like always."
00:10:10.151,00:10:11.193,-Worse? -Yeah!
00:10:11.277,00:10:13.237,She took down that wall with an ax.
00:10:13.321,00:10:15.406,She said that Will was inside and that he's talking to her.
00:10:15.489,00:10:16.991,Yeah. Maybe he was.
00:10:17.074,00:10:18.826,This isn't some kind of joke.
00:10:18.909,00:10:20.911,Your mom was half frozen to death when I got here.
00:10:20.995,00:10:22.371,"Trembling, scared out of her mind."
00:10:22.455,00:10:27.543,"You come in here and you start feeding into her hallucinations or whatever the hell you want to call it, you're gonna push her right over the edge."
00:10:28.711,00:10:30.004,You hear me?
00:10:35.468,00:10:36.761,I'm here to help.
00:10:37.678,00:10:39.639,I'm gonna make things better around here for all of us.
00:10:44.060,00:10:46.687,"Do me a favor. At the funeral tomorrow, just behave."
00:10:47.730,00:10:49.482,"If not for me, for your mother."
00:10:53.486,00:10:56.947,Take that down. It's inappropriate.
00:11:05.373,00:11:07.833,"-Good. -Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me."
00:11:07.917,00:11:10.628,Ah... there. It's supposed to be a little tight.
00:11:11.629,00:11:12.797,Looks good.
00:11:16.717,00:11:18.344,"You look nice, sweetie."
00:11:21.222,00:11:22.681,Anything else?
00:11:22.765,00:11:24.642,You can borrow my black heels if you want.
00:11:24.725,00:11:26.560,The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.
00:11:26.644,00:11:28.938,I'm fine. Thanks.
00:11:55.339,00:11:56.632,Ugh.
00:12:10.938,00:12:13.232,Come on. Time to go.
00:12:23.993,00:12:26.662,"Be not dismayed, for I am your God."
00:12:28.330,00:12:29.623,I will strengthen you.
00:12:29.707,00:12:31.876,"Yes, I will help you."
00:12:31.959,00:12:35.629,I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
00:12:41.135,00:12:43.721,"How, if He is truly benevolent..."
00:12:49.393,00:12:51.979,It would be easy to turn away from God...
00:12:53.063,00:12:58.027,"but we must remember that nothing, not even tragedy, can separate us from His love."
00:12:58.110,00:13:06.869,"We are here today to find comfort in the truth of scripture, Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral."
00:13:20.174,00:13:22.259,"Yeah, if there's anything we can do..."
00:13:22.343,00:13:24.386,I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
00:13:28.682,00:13:30.226,Thanks for coming out.
00:13:41.028,00:13:43.280,I see Will the Wise is back.
00:13:45.157,00:13:47.910,What's that shooting out of his cane?
00:13:47.993,00:13:49.411,Fireballs.
00:13:49.495,00:13:51.789,"I couldn't find the red crayon, so that's why it's green."
00:13:51.872,00:13:52.915,"Oh, well..."
00:13:52.998,00:13:56.043,"if he's so wise, why does he need fireballs?"
00:13:56.126,00:13:59.338,"Why can't he just, you know, outsmart the bad guys?"
00:14:00.381,00:14:02.049,"Most of the time, yeah, totally."
00:14:02.132,00:14:05.427,"But... sometimes the bad guys are smart, too."
00:14:05.511,00:14:06.512,You know?
00:14:07.054,00:14:08.055,Yeah.
00:14:08.138,00:14:10.099,So he needs the fireballs?
00:14:10.182,00:14:12.977,"Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp."
00:14:13.060,00:14:20.985,"All right. Well, I don't know who's been raising you, but I'm gonna get you some new crayons because it looks like he's shooting cabbages."
00:16:24.274,00:16:26.193,She was there.
00:16:28.070,00:16:30.823,"This is where we know for sure it's been, right?"
00:16:30.906,00:16:33.367,"-So, that's... -Steve's house."
00:16:33.450,00:16:35.995,And that's the woods where they found Will's bike and...
00:16:36.078,00:16:37.162,that's my house.
00:16:40.207,00:16:42.584,"I mean, it's all within a mile or something."
00:16:42.668,00:16:45.963,"Whatever this thing is, it's... it's not traveling far."
00:16:47.297,00:16:48.966,You want to go out there.
00:16:49.508,00:16:50.843,We might not find anything.
00:16:50.926,00:16:52.261,I found something.
00:16:55.597,00:16:58.142,And if we do see it...
00:17:05.607,00:17:07.067,We kill it.
00:17:09.570,00:17:12.364,-What are you doing? -Just give me a second.
00:17:21.040,00:17:22.541,Are you serious?
00:17:22.624,00:17:27.004,What? You want to find this thing and take another photo? Yell at it?
00:17:29.548,00:17:31.258,This is a terrible idea.
00:17:31.341,00:17:33.886,"Yeah, well, it's the best we've got."
00:17:33.969,00:17:36.889,"What? You can tell someone, but they're not gonna believe you."
00:17:36.972,00:17:37.973,You know that.
00:17:38.057,00:17:39.308,Your mom would.
00:17:39.391,00:17:41.894,-She's been through enough. -She deserves to know.
00:17:41.977,00:17:43.353,"Yeah, and I'll tell her..."
00:17:43.437,00:17:44.813,when this thing is dead.
00:17:49.359,00:17:51.445,I don't know what in the world caused it.
00:17:51.528,00:17:53.697,"-Let's take a look, huh? -Yeah."
00:17:53.781,00:17:56.450,Mr. Clarke says he's never seen anything like it.
00:17:56.533,00:17:57.576,Mr. Clarke?
00:17:58.494,00:18:00.579,"Yeah, he runs the AV Club."
00:18:01.872,00:18:05.250,"Apparently, some of the less athletic types go nuts for this stuff."
00:18:41.954,00:18:43.580,"Oh, hey, there."
00:18:44.414,00:18:45.791,How are you boys holding up?
00:18:47.584,00:18:50.003,We're... in... mourning.
00:18:50.087,00:18:52.840,"Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers."
00:18:55.300,00:18:58.470,-We have some questions. -A lot of questions.
00:18:58.554,00:19:01.473,"So, you know how in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions?"
00:19:01.557,00:19:02.683,"Like, beyond our world?"
00:19:02.766,00:19:04.268,"Yeah, sure. Theoretically."
00:19:04.351,00:19:05.435,"Right, theoretically."
00:19:05.519,00:19:08.105,"So, theoretically, how do we travel there?"
00:19:08.188,00:19:11.567,"You guys have been thinking about Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation, haven't you?"
00:19:13.777,00:19:16.280,"Well, basically, there are parallel universes."
00:19:16.363,00:19:20.325,"Just like our world, but just infinite variations of it."
00:19:21.285,00:19:24.246,Which means there's a world out there where none of this tragic stuff ever happened.
00:19:24.329,00:19:26.498,"Yeah, that's not what we're talking about."
00:19:26.582,00:19:29.751,"-Oh. -We were thinking of more of an evil dimension, like the Vale of Shadows."
00:19:29.835,00:19:31.378,You know the Vale of Shadows?
00:19:31.461,00:19:38.844,"An echo of the Material Plane, where necrotic and shadow magic-- If that did exist, a place like the Vale of Shadows, how would we travel there?"
00:19:45.767,00:19:48.353,Picture... an acrobat...
00:19:49.605,00:19:50.814,standing on a tightrope.
00:19:50.898,00:19:53.525,"Now, the tightrope is our dimension."
00:19:53.609,00:19:56.069,And our dimension has rules.
00:19:56.153,00:19:58.989,"You can move forwards, or backwards."
00:19:59.531,00:20:01.074,"But, what if..."
00:20:01.158,00:20:05.287,"right next to our acrobat, there is a flea?"
00:20:05.370,00:20:08.498,"Now, the flea can also travel back and forth, just like the acrobat."
00:20:08.582,00:20:09.875,-Right? -Right.
00:20:09.958,00:20:12.252,Here's where things get really interesting.
00:20:12.336,00:20:14.630,The flea can also travel this way...
00:20:14.713,00:20:16.840,along the side of the rope.
00:20:16.924,00:20:18.550,He can even go...
00:20:19.509,00:20:20.719,underneath the rope.
00:20:23.096,00:20:25.349,"But we're not the flea, we're the acrobat."
00:20:25.432,00:20:27.684,"In this metaphor, yes, we're the acrobat."
00:20:27.768,00:20:29.353,So we can't go upside down?
00:20:29.436,00:20:30.771,No.
00:20:30.854,00:20:33.607,"Well, is there any way for the acrobat to get to the Upside Down?"
00:20:33.690,00:20:37.277,Well... you'd have to create a massive amount of energy.
00:20:37.361,00:20:43.825,"More than humans are currently capable of creating, mind you, to open up some kind of tear in time and space, and then..."
00:20:49.873,00:20:51.083,you create a doorway.
00:20:51.166,00:20:53.835,-Like a gate? -Sure. Like a gate.
00:20:53.919,00:20:56.713,"-But again, this is all-- -Theoretical."
00:20:56.797,00:20:59.258,But... but what if this gate already existed?
00:20:59.341,00:21:01.760,"Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know."
00:21:01.843,00:21:05.180,"It would disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment."
00:21:05.264,00:21:07.683,"Heck, it might even swallow us up whole."
00:21:09.142,00:21:10.477,Science is neat.
00:21:29.454,00:21:30.539,"Hey, Chief!"
00:21:37.629,00:21:41.300,"-We tried calling, but-- -Yeah, the phone's dead."
00:21:42.884,00:21:45.804,"Hey, so Bev Mooney came in this morning all upset."
00:21:45.887,00:21:48.557,Said that Dale and Henry went hunting yesterday...
00:21:48.640,00:21:49.683,and they didn't come back home.
00:21:49.766,00:21:54.229,"She thought they were on another binger, but she's not so sure now."
00:21:58.650,00:22:00.277,-Where was this? -It was at the station.
00:22:00.360,00:22:02.279,"No, no. Where did Henry and Dale go hunting?"
00:22:02.362,00:22:04.239,"Oh. Uh, out near Kerley."
00:22:04.740,00:22:05.824,Mirkwood.
00:22:05.907,00:22:07.159,What?
00:22:07.659,00:22:08.994,Okay.
00:22:09.077,00:22:11.788,"You go back to the station. I'll take care of this, all right?"
00:22:12.331,00:22:14.541,"-Are you sure? -Yeah, leave it."
00:22:14.624,00:22:18.086,"-Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car. -What?"
00:22:18.170,00:22:21.089,Barbara Holland's car. Seems she ran away after all.
00:22:23.800,00:22:26.845,"Funny, right? They keep doing our job for us."
00:22:37.939,00:22:40.567,He's been spending too much time with Joyce Byers.
00:22:40.650,00:22:41.902,That's what I think.
00:22:51.119,00:22:52.746,What does it look like I'm doing?
00:22:52.829,00:22:54.372,You want to freeze to death all winter?
00:22:57.334,00:23:01.588,"-I told you not to take these down. -They were in the way, babe."
00:23:01.671,00:23:04.049,"How long are you gonna keep those up? I mean, really?"
00:23:08.845,00:23:11.389,"You know, it's a shame what they've done to this family."
00:23:11.473,00:23:13.266,-What? -The Sattler Company.
00:23:13.350,00:23:15.060,I went to the quarry on the way over here.
00:23:15.143,00:23:17.145,"I just wanted to look around, you know?"
00:23:17.229,00:23:19.731,Couldn't believe it. I just couldn't believe it.
00:23:21.858,00:23:24.402,"No warning signs, no fence, no nothing."
00:23:25.362,00:23:27.531,Ought to be held accountable if you ask me.
00:23:31.910,00:23:34.412,It would take a lot of energy to build a gate like this.
00:23:34.496,00:23:35.580,But that's got to be what happened.
00:23:35.664,00:23:39.709,"-Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right? -Right."
00:23:39.793,00:23:42.671,"What we want to know is, do you know where the gate is?"
00:23:55.642,00:23:56.893,-Dustin! -Dustin!
00:23:57.936,00:23:59.896,-I... I need to see your compasses. -What?
00:23:59.980,00:24:02.274,"Your compasses. All of your compasses, right now!"
00:24:07.779,00:24:09.364,What's exciting about this?
00:24:09.447,00:24:12.951,"-Well, they're all facing north, right? -Yeah, so?"
00:24:13.034,00:24:14.911,"-Well, that's not true north. -What do you mean?"
00:24:14.995,00:24:18.081,I mean exactly what I just said. That's not true north.
00:24:18.165,00:24:20.500,Are you both seriously this dense?
00:24:22.210,00:24:26.715,"The sun rises in the east, and it sets in the west. Right?"
00:24:26.798,00:24:29.176,Which means that's true north.
00:24:29.259,00:24:30.969,So what you're saying is the compasses are broken.
00:24:34.598,00:24:36.850,-Do you see a battery pack on this? -No.
00:24:36.933,00:24:38.935,"No, you don't. Because it doesn't need one."
00:24:39.019,00:24:41.813,The needle's naturally drawn to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.
00:24:41.897,00:24:43.315,So what's wrong with them?
00:24:43.398,00:24:45.400,"Well, that's what I couldn't figure out, but then I remembered."
00:24:45.483,00:24:47.527,You can change the direction of a compass with a magnet.
00:24:47.611,00:24:51.781,"If there's the presence of a more powerful magnetic field, the needle deflects to that power."
00:24:51.865,00:24:53.533,And then I remembered what Mr. Clarke said.
00:24:53.617,00:24:56.953,The gate would have so much power-- It could disrupt the electromagnetic field.
00:24:57.037,00:24:58.079,Exactly.
00:24:58.163,00:25:00.540,"Meaning, if we follow the compasses' north..."
00:25:00.624,00:25:02.584,They should lead us to the gate.
00:25:56.805,00:25:58.139,"Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa."
00:26:02.185,00:26:05.146,-Nothing. -I hope that's not meant for me.
00:26:05.230,00:26:06.606,What? No.
00:26:06.690,00:26:08.733,"Oh, no, I was just..."
00:26:09.693,00:26:12.570,-thinking about joining softball. -Oh.
00:26:13.530,00:26:14.531,"Well, uh..."
00:26:14.614,00:26:15.949,"listen, I'm really sorry."
00:26:16.032,00:26:18.785,"I mean, even before you threatened me with the baseball bat."
00:26:20.245,00:26:21.621,Okay.
00:26:21.705,00:26:23.206,I panicked and...
00:26:24.457,00:26:28.086,"-I mean, I was a total dick. -Yeah, you were."
00:26:31.631,00:26:33.800,Did you get in trouble with your parents?
00:26:33.883,00:26:35.135,"Totally, but..."
00:26:35.218,00:26:37.387,"you know, who cares? Screw 'em."
00:26:37.470,00:26:39.306,Any news about Barbara?
00:26:41.141,00:26:43.351,-Parents heard from her? Or... -No.
00:26:46.521,00:26:47.522,"Hey, listen."
00:26:47.605,00:26:50.608,"Why don't we, uh, why don't we catch a movie tonight, you know?"
00:26:50.692,00:26:53.361,Just kinda pretend everything's normal for a few hours.
00:26:53.445,00:26:55.238,All The Right Moves is still playing.
00:26:58.825,00:26:59.868,"Yeah, I know."
00:26:59.951,00:27:01.619,"You know, Carol thinks I actually kinda look like him."
00:27:01.703,00:27:03.455,What do you think? Huh?
00:27:09.294,00:27:12.672,"I just, I... I don't think I can."
00:27:13.673,00:27:17.218,I've been really busy with this whole funeral thing and...
00:27:21.306,00:27:23.933,"Yeah, sure. Sure, yeah, yeah."
00:27:25.852,00:27:27.395,So...
00:27:30.023,00:27:31.149,I should go.
00:27:32.150,00:27:33.318,Sorry.
00:27:35.278,00:27:38.031,I'll call you later. Is that okay?
00:27:40.617,00:27:42.786,"Yeah. Yeah, of course."
00:28:02.972,00:28:05.558,The money! Admit it!
00:28:05.642,00:28:09.187,You aren't here 'cause of Will. You never cared about him. You never did!
00:28:09.312,00:28:12.565,"Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral today. Do we have to do this right now?"
00:28:12.649,00:28:15.193,"-I can't believe I fell for this. -I'm here to help, Joyce."
00:28:15.276,00:28:17.529,-To help? -We could use that money for good.
00:28:20.365,00:28:22.700,To pay for Jonathan to go to school!
00:28:22.784,00:28:24.911,"-Oh, don't do that. -Do what?"
00:28:24.994,00:28:26.996,-Lie to me! -I'm not lying to you!
00:28:27.080,00:28:28.456,"Yeah, well, where does he wanna go?"
00:28:28.540,00:28:29.582,-Huh? -What?
00:28:29.666,00:28:31.251,Where does Jonathan want to go to college?
00:28:31.334,00:28:33.253,"We get that money, anywhere he damn well pleases!"
00:28:33.336,00:28:35.088,"NYU, Lonnie!"
00:28:35.171,00:28:38.717,He's wanted to go to NYU since he was six years old!
00:28:38.800,00:28:41.094,So then he goes to NYU!
00:28:41.177,00:28:42.345,Get out.
00:28:43.471,00:28:44.889,Get out!
00:28:45.724,00:28:46.975,"You need me here, Joyce."
00:28:50.770,00:28:53.064,"Oh, no? Look what happened."
00:28:54.983,00:28:57.318,"Oh, don't you dare."
00:29:01.906,00:29:03.283,All your Christmas lights.
00:29:03.366,00:29:06.453,What the hell am I supposed to think? You're such a great mom? You're a mess!
00:29:06.536,00:29:09.748,Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I'm out of my mind!
00:29:09.831,00:29:17.630,"But, God help me, I will keep these lights up until the day I die if I think there's a chance that Will's still out there!"
00:29:19.174,00:29:21.634,"Now, get out!"
00:29:22.218,00:29:23.803,Get out of my house!
00:29:40.528,00:29:44.157,"No, actually, you see the spaces in between the cans?"
00:29:44.240,00:29:46.117,I'm aiming for those.
00:29:46.201,00:29:47.243,Ah.
00:29:49.496,00:29:51.080,You ever shot a gun before?
00:29:54.959,00:29:57.003,"Yeah, I haven't shot one since I was ten."
00:29:57.879,00:30:00.507,My dad took me hunting on my birthday.
00:30:00.590,00:30:02.342,He made me kill a rabbit.
00:30:02.425,00:30:04.219,-A rabbit? -Yeah.
00:30:04.302,00:30:08.014,I guess he thought it would make me into more of a man or something.
00:30:09.140,00:30:10.433,I cried for a week.
00:30:10.517,00:30:11.684,Jesus.
00:30:11.768,00:30:14.020,What? I'm a fan of Thumper.
00:30:17.482,00:30:18.691,Yeah.
00:30:19.901,00:30:22.737,"I guess he and my mother loved each other at some point, but..."
00:30:24.489,00:30:26.157,...I wasn't around for that part.
00:30:28.535,00:30:29.702,"Um, yeah."
00:30:30.745,00:30:33.248,"Just, uh, point and shoot."
00:30:35.792,00:30:38.211,I don't think my parents ever loved each other.
00:30:38.294,00:30:40.255,They must've married for some reason.
00:30:40.338,00:30:41.714,My mom was young.
00:30:42.674,00:30:49.347,"My dad was older, but he had a cushy job, money, came from a good family."
00:30:50.974,00:30:54.727,So they bought a nice house at the end of the cul-de-sac...
00:30:54.811,00:30:56.771,and started their nuclear family.
00:30:57.856,00:30:59.691,Screw that.
00:30:59.774,00:31:00.942,Yeah.
00:31:02.318,00:31:03.570,Screw that.
00:31:19.085,00:31:20.670,Jim?
00:31:22.589,00:31:25.258,Why are you calling me here? I told you not to call me.
00:31:25.341,00:31:27.969,"I know, I know, I know. I just wanted to..."
00:31:28.052,00:31:30.430,"I just wanted to hear your voice and, uh..."
00:31:32.390,00:31:34.642,"I just wanted to say that, um..."
00:31:39.105,00:31:41.524,"even after everything that happened, I don't..."
00:31:42.859,00:31:44.277,I don't regret any of it.
00:31:44.360,00:31:47.238,"And those seven years, they were... everything to me."
00:31:48.197,00:31:49.782,Have you been drinking?
00:31:51.326,00:31:52.577,No.
00:32:02.629,00:32:04.923,"You know what, actually, I have been drinking, I'm sorry."
00:32:05.006,00:32:06.382,"Jim, I can't..."
00:32:06.466,00:32:08.551,"Just take care of yourself, okay?"
00:32:08.635,00:32:10.011,Say hi to Bill for me.
00:32:10.094,00:32:44.420,"Are you sure-- I don't know. These only tell direction, not distance."
00:32:47.799,00:32:49.258,I'm just saying.
00:32:49.342,00:32:51.761,How do we know when we get to the gate?
00:32:51.844,00:32:55.515,"Uh, I think a portal to another dimension is gonna be pretty obvious."
00:33:00.478,00:33:02.021,Do you think she's acting weird?
00:33:03.231,00:33:05.692,You're asking if the weirdo is acting weird?
00:33:07.026,00:33:08.903,"I mean, weirder than normal?"
00:33:10.029,00:33:11.614,I don't know. Who cares?
00:33:20.748,00:33:21.916,"How far, Papa?"
00:33:22.000,00:33:24.252,Farther than we've ever gone before.
00:33:29.007,00:33:30.633,-The bath? -Yes.
00:33:31.676,00:33:33.261,"Yes, the bath."
00:33:36.681,00:33:38.057,Is that okay?
00:33:42.311,00:33:43.354,Okay.
00:35:12.527,00:35:13.569,Mike.
00:35:14.529,00:35:16.030,Yeah?
00:35:16.114,00:35:17.657,Turn back.
00:35:17.740,00:35:19.283,What? Why?
00:35:19.367,00:35:20.451,I'm tired.
00:35:47.895,00:35:51.440,You said I was saying something and that's why you took my picture.
00:35:51.524,00:35:52.692,"Oh, uh..."
00:35:53.609,00:35:54.861,I don't know.
00:35:57.280,00:35:58.531,My guess...
00:36:00.533,00:36:04.745,"I saw this girl, you know, trying to be someone else."
00:36:04.829,00:36:07.290,But for that moment...
00:36:07.373,00:36:09.834,"it was like you were alone, or you thought you were."
00:36:09.917,00:36:12.295,"And, you know, you could just be yourself."
00:36:15.214,00:36:18.092,That is such bullshit.
00:36:20.970,00:36:23.264,I am not trying to be someone else.
00:36:23.347,00:36:28.561,Just because I'm dating Steve and you don't like him-- You know what? Forget it. I just thought it was a good picture.
00:36:28.644,00:36:30.646,He's actually a good guy.
00:36:32.857,00:36:35.193,"Yesterday, with the camera..."
00:36:36.194,00:36:38.321,He's not like that at all.
00:36:38.404,00:36:40.698,He was just being protective.
00:36:40.781,00:36:42.617,"Yeah, that's one word for it."
00:36:43.576,00:36:45.536,"Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?"
00:36:45.620,00:36:47.121,"No, I... I never said that."
00:36:47.205,00:36:50.541,"He had every right to be pissed-- Okay, all right. Does that mean I have to like him?"
00:36:50.625,00:36:52.043,No.
00:36:52.126,00:36:54.212,"Listen, don't take it so personally, okay?"
00:36:54.295,00:36:57.173,I don't like most people. He's in the vast majority.
00:36:59.133,00:37:02.261,"You know, I was actually starting to think that you were okay."
00:37:02.345,00:37:04.180,-Yeah? -Yeah.
00:37:04.263,00:37:10.645,"Yeah, I was thinking, Jonathan Byers, maybe he's not the pretentious creep everyone says he is."
00:37:10.728,00:37:12.730,"Well, I was just starting to think you were okay."
00:37:12.813,00:37:20.696,"-Oh. -I was thinking, Nancy Wheeler, she's not just another suburban girl who thinks she's rebelling by doing exactly what every other suburban girl does..."
00:37:27.662,00:37:33.084,"Exactly like their parents, who they thought were so depressing, but now, hey, they get it."
00:37:43.594,00:37:45.304,"Go away, Lonnie."
00:37:48.266,00:37:49.308,Seriously!
00:37:50.226,00:38:09.287,"I am gonna murd-- Oh, Jesus."
00:38:23.175,00:38:24.802,"Oh, no."
00:38:24.885,00:38:27.680,"Oh, no? What's, Oh, no?"
00:38:27.763,00:38:29.223,-We're headed back home. -What?
00:38:29.307,00:38:30.558,"-Are you sure? -Yeah, I'm sure."
00:38:30.641,00:38:32.977,"Setting sun, right there. We looped right back around."
00:38:33.060,00:38:35.604,And you're just realizing this now?
00:38:35.688,00:38:38.607,-Why is this all on me? -Because you're the compass genius!
00:38:38.691,00:38:40.192,What do yours say?
00:38:46.490,00:38:48.367,"No, I don't think it's the gate."
00:38:48.451,00:38:51.287,I think it's something else screwing with the compasses.
00:38:51.370,00:38:53.122,Maybe it's something here.
00:38:53.205,00:38:55.624,"No, it has to be like a super magnet."
00:38:55.708,00:38:57.376,It's not a magnet.
00:38:57.460,00:38:59.378,She's been acting weirder than normal.
00:38:59.462,00:39:02.298,"If she can slam doors with her mind, she can definitely screw up a compass."
00:39:02.381,00:39:03.424,Why would she do that?
00:39:03.507,00:39:05.468,Because she's trying to sabotage our mission.
00:39:05.551,00:39:06.886,Because she's a traitor!
00:39:12.600,00:39:14.852,"You did it, didn't you?"
00:39:14.935,00:39:16.729,You don't want us to reach the gate.
00:39:16.812,00:39:18.647,You don't want us to find Will.
00:39:19.940,00:39:21.108,-just leave her alone! -Admit it.
00:39:21.192,00:39:22.818,-No. -Admit it!
00:39:23.903,00:39:26.989,"-Fresh blood. I knew it. -Lucas, come on!"
00:39:27.073,00:39:30.159,I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks! She was using her powers!
00:39:30.242,00:39:32.036,"Bull! That's old blood. Right, El?"
00:39:33.579,00:39:35.206,"Right, El?"
00:39:41.462,00:39:43.506,it's not safe.
00:40:05.152,00:40:06.737,"Should be okay, I mean..."
00:40:07.696,00:40:09.824,"I can't guarantee it, but it should be okay."
00:40:09.907,00:40:11.575,"What the hell is going on, Hopper?"
00:40:11.659,00:40:13.869,They bugged my place.
00:40:13.953,00:40:15.287,-What? -They bugged my place.
00:40:15.371,00:40:17.832,They put a microphone in the light.
00:40:20.543,00:40:23.170,It's because I'm on to them and they know it.
00:40:23.254,00:40:24.964,-I don't know... -Who?
00:40:25.047,00:40:26.424,"I thought they might be watching you, too."
00:40:26.507,00:40:29.760,"I don't know, the CIA, the NSA, Department of Energy... I don't know."
00:40:29.844,00:40:35.141,"You gotta explain this to me, 'cause I am not-- I went to the morgue last night, Joyce."
00:40:36.559,00:40:37.601,What?
00:40:38.227,00:40:39.603,It wasn't him.
00:40:40.479,00:40:41.522,What?
00:40:41.605,00:40:43.732,"Will's body, it was a fake."
00:40:50.948,00:40:52.408,You were right.
00:40:55.077,00:40:57.079,"This whole time, you were right."
00:41:02.585,00:41:05.212,What did I tell you? She's been playing us from the beginning!
00:41:05.296,00:41:07.506,That's not true. She helped us find Will!
00:41:07.590,00:41:08.591,Find Will?
00:41:08.674,00:41:09.925,Find Will?
00:41:10.009,00:41:13.387,"Where is he, then? Huh? I don't see him."
00:41:13.471,00:41:16.140,"-Yeah, you know what I mean. -No, I actually don't."
00:41:16.223,00:41:17.475,"Just think about it, Mike."
00:41:17.558,00:41:21.395,"She could've just told us where the Upside Down was right away, but she didn't."
00:41:21.479,00:41:23.439,She just made us run around like headless chickens.
00:41:23.522,00:41:25.149,"-All right, calm down! -No!"
00:41:27.109,00:41:29.487,She helped just enough so she could get what she wants.
00:41:29.570,00:41:30.779,Food and a bed.
00:41:30.863,00:41:33.073,"-She's like a stray dog. -Screw you, Lucas!"
00:41:33.157,00:41:35.159,"No! Screw you, Mike. You're blind..."
00:41:35.242,00:41:37.536,blind because you like that a girl's not grossed out by you.
00:41:37.620,00:41:40.080,"But wake up, man! Wake the hell up!"
00:41:40.998,00:41:45.085,"She knows where Will is, and now she's just letting him die in the Upside Down."
00:41:45.169,00:41:47.630,"-Shut up! -For all we know, it's her fault."
00:41:47.713,00:41:48.756,Shut up.
00:41:48.839,00:41:51.300,We're looking for some stupid monster...
00:41:51.383,00:41:55.596,but did you ever stop to think that maybe she's the monster?
00:41:56.722,00:41:58.015,I said shut up!
00:42:10.444,00:42:11.445,Jesus!
00:42:13.697,00:42:16.325,"Lucas! Lucas! Lucas, are you all right?"
00:42:20.412,00:42:22.081,Why would you do that?
00:43:43.996,00:43:45.414,I have no idea.
00:44:09.396,00:44:11.231,"Lucas... Lucas, come on!"
00:44:17.279,00:44:18.572,"Lucas, you okay?"
00:44:22.826,00:44:24.203,"Lucas, how many fingers?"
00:44:28.874,00:44:30.167,Get off of me!
00:44:32.544,00:44:34.296,"-Lucas, come on. -Let him go."
00:44:37.174,00:44:38.592,"Man, let him go."
00:44:43.222,00:44:44.932,Where is El?
00:44:48.977,00:44:50.562,-El! -Eleven!
00:44:52.439,00:44:53.482,El!
00:44:54.858,00:44:56.568,-Eleven! -El!
00:44:57.736,00:44:58.862,Eleven!
00:45:23.971,00:45:25.222,"What, are you tired?"
00:45:25.305,00:45:26.765,Shut up.
00:45:26.849,00:45:27.891,What?
00:45:30.227,00:45:33.021,I heard something.
00:46:11.101,00:46:12.519,We can't just leave it.
00:46:28.243,00:46:29.620,I'll do it.
00:46:31.705,00:46:34.166,-I thought you said-- -I'm not nine anymore.
00:47:03.237,00:47:04.404,What was that?
00:47:38.939,00:47:40.482,I don't know.
00:47:42.901,00:47:44.528,Do you see any more blood?
00:47:45.571,00:47:47.072,No.
00:48:33.702,00:48:34.911,Jonathan?
00:50:17.013,00:50:18.432,Nancy?
00:50:19.766,00:50:21.059,Nancy?
00:50:22.102,00:50:23.687,"Nancy, where are you?"
00:50:26.106,00:50:27.441,Nancy!
00:50:28.775,00:50:29.985,Nancy!
00:00:12.387,00:00:13.763,"Come on, come on."
00:00:13.847,00:00:15.432,Nancy!
00:00:17.559,00:00:18.643,Where are you?
00:00:22.355,00:00:23.940,Jonathan!
00:00:25.650,00:00:27.360,"Jonathan, I'm right here!"
00:00:28.028,00:00:29.195,Nancy!
00:00:31.614,00:00:32.741,Nancy!
00:00:38.204,00:00:39.914,Jonathan!
00:00:39.998,00:00:42.125,"Jonathan, I'm right... I'm right here!"
00:00:45.795,00:00:48.173,I'm right here! Nancy!
00:00:56.097,00:00:57.182,Nancy!
00:01:00.226,00:01:01.186,Nancy!
00:01:31.049,00:01:32.092,Nancy?
00:01:34.552,00:01:35.720,Nancy.
00:01:46.523,00:01:47.774,Nancy?
00:03:37.008,00:03:38.760,I just don't understand why we're coming out here.
00:03:38.843,00:03:42.096,-She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you. -That's... that's not it.
00:03:42.180,00:03:45.850,"Oh, really? Because no girl would ever blow off King Steve."
00:03:45.934,00:03:48.603,"She was acting weird. I mean, something was wrong."
00:03:50.688,00:03:54.108,"-What? -Aw, you are."
00:03:54.192,00:03:56.903,"-Aw, Steve has a heart. -Would you just-- Stop."
00:03:56.986,00:03:58.571,"-Oh, Stevey's in love. -Would you just shut up?"
00:03:58.655,00:03:59.989,-Who knew? -Shut up!
00:04:49.455,00:04:52.250,"-I told you everything that I saw. -Oh, gosh. Tell me again."
00:04:52.333,00:04:54.627,-Upstairs or downstairs? -Upstairs.
00:04:54.711,00:04:55.837,There was a laboratory.
00:04:55.920,00:04:58.506,"It was where they must do experiments or something, and then there was..."
00:04:59.716,00:05:01.134,There was this kid's room.
00:05:01.217,00:05:04.887,-How do you know it was a kid's room? -More like a prison.
00:05:04.971,00:05:07.390,"So why would you think it was a kid's room, then?"
00:05:07.473,00:05:15.273,"Because, I told you, the size of the bed, there was a drawing, there was a stuffed animal-- Yeah, there was a drawing of a... an adult and a child."
00:05:15.356,00:05:17.692,-It said Eleven on it. -Was it good?
00:05:17.775,00:05:20.028,"It was a kid's drawing, Joyce. It was stick figures."
00:05:25.825,00:05:27.785,Wasn't Will.
00:05:36.753,00:05:37.962,Earl...
00:05:39.714,00:05:46.220,"The night that Benny died, Earl said he saw some kid with a shaved head with Benny."
00:05:46.304,00:05:50.058,"Now, I pressed him, he said it might be Will, but maybe..."
00:05:50.141,00:05:51.934,"Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?"
00:05:52.018,00:05:56.522,"Look... this woman, Terry Ives, she claims to have lost her daughter, Jane."
00:05:56.606,00:05:59.025,"She sued Brenner, she sued the government..."
00:05:59.108,00:06:01.486,"Now, the claims came to nothing, but what if..."
00:06:03.237,00:06:05.698,"I mean, what if this whole time I've been..."
00:06:05.782,00:06:07.450,I've been looking for Will...
00:06:08.451,00:06:10.495,I've been chasing after some other kid?
00:06:52.078,00:06:53.204,Yeah.
00:06:54.914,00:06:58.084,"Is this okay? Uh, I found it in the closet."
00:07:09.053,00:07:12.265,-Do you? -No. Uh... no.
00:07:47.175,00:07:49.177,Can you just come up here?
00:07:54.640,00:07:55.766,Yeah.
00:08:16.037,00:08:17.413,"You know, it..."
00:08:18.414,00:08:20.249,it can't get us in here.
00:08:25.588,00:08:27.173,We don't know that.
00:09:32.071,00:09:35.700,"Uh, yeah, it's Ives. Terry Ives. That's with a Y."
00:09:35.783,00:09:38.703,"Yeah, I got a pen. Hang on."
00:09:41.414,00:09:42.665,Mmm-hmm.
00:09:45.418,00:09:48.546,"Great, thanks. I really appreciate this, Frank."
00:09:48.629,00:09:50.631,"Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?"
00:09:58.014,00:09:59.682,Did you get it?
00:09:59.765,00:10:01.684,-I got it. -Okay.
00:10:22.580,00:10:23.706,Oh...
00:10:24.707,00:10:25.791,Hey.
00:10:35.301,00:10:37.887,"Every time I close my eyes, I just..."
00:10:39.805,00:10:42.516,keep seeing that... thing.
00:10:43.392,00:10:47.063,"Wherever I was, that place..."
00:10:48.147,00:10:50.733,I think that it lives there.
00:10:50.816,00:10:52.652,It was feeding there.
00:10:53.986,00:10:55.780,Feeding on that deer.
00:10:59.325,00:11:01.744,if Will and Barbara...
00:11:05.665,00:11:06.832,Hey.
00:11:07.458,00:11:09.585,My mom said she talked to Will.
00:11:10.336,00:11:13.005,"If he's alive, there's a chance Barbara is, too."
00:11:13.089,00:11:15.091,That means that she's trapped...
00:11:15.716,00:11:17.510,in that place.
00:11:21.472,00:11:23.265,We have to find it again.
00:11:23.349,00:11:25.309,You wanna go back out there?
00:11:25.851,00:11:27.186,Maybe we don't have to.
00:11:27.853,00:11:30.564,"When I saw it, it was feeding on that deer."
00:11:30.648,00:11:33.776,"-Meaning it's... it's a predator, right? -Right."
00:11:33.859,00:11:37.947,"And it seems to hunt at night, like a... a lion or a coyote."
00:11:38.030,00:11:39.740,But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.
00:11:40.658,00:11:42.993,"It's always alone, like..."
00:11:44.078,00:11:45.121,like a bear.
00:11:45.204,00:11:48.541,"And remember at Steve's, when Barb cut herself?"
00:11:48.624,00:11:52.169,"-And then, last night, the deer... -Hmm, it was bleeding, too."
00:11:52.294,00:11:53.504,One sec.
00:11:57.049,00:12:01.345,"That's one drop of blood in a million, and they can smell it from a quarter mile away."
00:12:01.429,00:12:04.098,So you're saying it can detect blood?
00:12:08.686,00:12:10.187,We could test it.
00:12:12.523,00:12:14.400,But if it works...
00:12:15.317,00:12:17.278,At least we'll know it's coming.
00:12:23.159,00:12:25.661,"Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed."
00:12:28.372,00:12:30.040,I'll be down in a second.
00:12:57.026,00:12:59.111,"-Hi. Scott Clarke? -Uh, yes."
00:12:59.195,00:13:02.490,The same Scott Clarke who teaches science and AV -at Hawkins Middle? -The very same.
00:13:02.573,00:13:03.824,"Oh, wonderful."
00:13:03.908,00:13:07.411,"...and we're making a newsletter, which we'll send out monthly."
00:13:07.495,00:13:12.416,"It'll showcase all the latest equipment, as well as how-to articles, which the kids write themselves."
00:13:12.500,00:13:13.918,"Oh, that's neat."
00:13:14.001,00:13:17.254,"What we're really trying to do here, Mr. Clarke-- Uh, please, call me Scott."
00:13:17.379,00:13:18.923,Scott.
00:13:19.006,00:13:27.097,"What we're trying to do here, Scott, is to connect kids from all over the state and give them the support and encouragement to pursue careers in technology."
00:13:27.181,00:13:29.892,We feel these are the kinds of kids that are going to make Indiana proud.
00:13:29.975,00:13:32.520,"I agree, yes. Completely."
00:13:32.603,00:13:35.606,"So, you know any kids you think might wanna participate?"
00:13:35.689,00:13:38.400,"Oh, I have a few in mind."
00:13:54.041,00:13:56.585,She just messed up the compasses because she wanted to protect us.
00:13:56.669,00:13:58.796,"-She didn't betray us. -Mike, calm down."
00:13:58.879,00:14:01.131,I shouldn't have yelled at her. I never should've done that.
00:14:01.215,00:14:03.801,"-Mike, this isn't your fault. -Yeah, it's Lucas'."
00:14:03.926,00:14:05.010,"It wasn't his fault, either."
00:14:06.428,00:14:08.222,-It wasn't his fault? -No.
00:14:08.305,00:14:10.015,So you're saying he wasn't way out of line?
00:14:10.099,00:14:11.642,"-Totally, but so were you! -What?"
00:14:11.725,00:14:13.394,"-And so was Eleven. -Oh, give me a break!"
00:14:13.477,00:14:14.645,"No, Mike, you give me a break!"
00:14:14.728,00:14:17.189,All three of you were being a bunch of little assholes!
00:14:17.273,00:14:18.816,I was the only reasonable one.
00:14:18.899,00:14:21.569,But the bottom line is... you pushed first.
00:14:21.652,00:14:23.529,And you know the rule. You draw first blood...
00:14:23.612,00:14:25.364,No! No way! I'm not shaking his hand.
00:14:25.447,00:14:26.991,"-You're shaking his hand! -No, I'm not."
00:14:27.074,00:14:30.119,This isn't a discussion. This is the rule of law.
00:14:30.202,00:14:33.998,Obey or be banished from the party. Do you wanna be banished?
00:14:34.623,00:14:35.958,-No. -Good.
00:14:38.377,00:14:39.545,Where are we going?
00:14:39.670,00:14:41.964,Where do you think? We're going to get Lucas.
00:14:42.047,00:14:43.966,And then we're gonna find Eleven.
00:14:59.940,00:15:02.651,Today is a very special day.
00:15:04.194,00:15:05.446,Do you know why?
00:15:12.244,00:15:15.289,"Today, we make contact."
00:16:09.051,00:16:11.095,Ah... yum.
00:16:12.012,00:16:14.515,"Okay. Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake."
00:16:15.432,00:16:17.643,Where is Nancy? I thought she was coming down.
00:16:20.020,00:16:23.065,"Uh, she was. I don't know."
00:16:25.609,00:16:27.236,Nancy?
00:16:42.626,00:17:11.155,Nan-- What do you want?
00:17:33.343,00:17:35.345,"Okay, I'll shake."
00:17:36.055,00:17:37.264,On one condition.
00:17:37.389,00:17:39.433,We forget the weirdo and go straight to the gate.
00:17:39.516,00:17:40.934,-Then the deal's off. -Fine!
00:17:42.811,00:17:44.104,"Guys, seriously?"
00:17:45.022,00:17:47.441,Do you even remember what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?
00:17:54.448,00:17:56.366,and those trolls took us out one by one.
00:17:56.450,00:17:59.161,And it all went to shit. And we were all disabled!
00:17:59.995,00:18:02.122,"So we stick together, no matter what!"
00:18:02.206,00:18:07.127,"Yeah, I agree. But this is the party, right here in this room."
00:18:07.211,00:18:11.090,"-El is one of us now. -Um, no, she's not. Not even close!"
00:18:11.215,00:18:15.344,"Never will be. She's a liar, a traitor-- She was just trying to keep us safe!"
00:18:15.427,00:18:16.970,She didn't mean to hurt you. It was an accident!
00:18:17.054,00:18:18.263,An accident?
00:18:18.347,00:18:20.307,"All right, accident or not..."
00:18:20.390,00:18:22.434,"-admit it, it was a little awesome. -Awesome?"
00:18:22.518,00:18:24.436,"Yeah, she threw you in the air with her mind!"
00:18:24.561,00:18:26.271,I could have been killed!
00:18:26.355,00:18:29.149,Which is exactly why we need her. She's a weapon!
00:18:29.233,00:18:31.360,Do you seriously wanna fight the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?
00:18:31.443,00:18:33.737,That's like R2-D2 going to fight Darth Vader.
00:18:33.821,00:18:35.697,We're no use to Will if we're dead.
00:18:36.698,00:18:43.247,"If you two wanna waste your time looking for a traitor, go ahead, 'cause I'm not spending my time on her anymore. No way!"
00:18:44.748,00:18:47.751,I'm going to the gate. I'm gonna find Will.
00:19:24.580,00:19:28.041,Don't be frightened. These are all friends.
00:19:29.543,00:19:31.211,They're just here to watch.
00:19:33.297,00:19:35.090,Don't focus on them.
00:19:35.174,00:19:37.718,"Stay in here, like before."
00:19:38.802,00:19:40.387,"Yes, Papa."
00:19:45.767,00:19:48.854,"Now, remember. Whatever it is, it can't hurt you."
00:19:48.937,00:19:52.524,Not from here. So there's nothing to be frightened of.
00:19:54.318,00:19:55.736,It's reaching out to you...
00:19:56.653,00:19:58.655,'cause it wants you.
00:19:58.739,00:20:00.365,Hmm?
00:20:00.449,00:20:01.658,It's calling you...
00:20:02.576,00:20:04.494,so don't turn away from it this time.
00:20:05.412,00:20:06.914,I want you to find it.
00:20:07.831,00:20:09.082,Understand?
00:20:10.000,00:20:11.084,Yes.
00:20:50.332,00:20:51.541,Is your mom here?
00:20:54.044,00:20:55.212,Your dad?
00:20:57.631,00:20:59.174,Mouth breather.
00:21:15.190,00:21:16.775,Call the police.
00:21:19.861,00:21:23.824,Excuse me. Young lady! You know you have to pay for those!
00:21:29.371,00:21:31.873,Stop right there! Thief! Thief!
00:21:58.442,00:21:59.484,Can I help you?
00:21:59.568,00:22:01.611,"Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives. Does she live here?"
00:22:01.695,00:22:04.656,-Who's asking? -The Hawkins chief of police.
00:22:08.535,00:22:11.371,And you want to talk to my sister?
00:22:11.455,00:22:14.291,"Well, if your sister's Terry Ives, then, yeah, we do."
00:22:16.668,00:22:22.299,"Okay, well, you can come in, but if you want Terry to tell you anything, you're about five years too late."
00:22:24.885,00:22:26.762,"Terry, you have some visitors."
00:22:27.929,00:22:31.391,Hello. My name's Joyce Byers.
00:22:31.516,00:22:34.519,"Uh, this is Hopper. We drove over from Hawkins."
00:22:34.686,00:22:37.981,"Um, you see, uh, my son..."
00:22:38.065,00:22:46.281,"he's been missing for almost a week now, and, um, we were wondering if we could talk to you about your daughter, Jane?"
00:22:46.406,00:22:50.369,If there's anything that you could tell us about when she was taken...
00:22:51.370,00:22:53.205,What was your relationship with Dr. Brenner?
00:22:54.206,00:22:55.499,You guys keep in touch?
00:22:58.126,00:23:00.170,"This is, uh... this is him."
00:23:02.798,00:23:05.550,"Uh, you may have seen him on... on the news."
00:23:05.675,00:23:07.928,-Uh... -What's wrong with her?
00:23:08.011,00:23:10.722,"I told you, you're wasting your time."
00:23:48.969,00:23:51.847,-He should've shaken my hand. -He's just jealous.
00:23:52.472,00:23:53.890,What are you talking about?
00:24:00.439,00:24:02.441,"He's your best friend, right?"
00:24:02.524,00:24:06.528,"-Yeah... I mean, I don't know. -It's fine. I get it."
00:24:06.611,00:24:10.115,I didn't get here until the fourth grade. He had the advantage of living next door.
00:24:10.198,00:24:11.533,But none of that matters.
00:24:11.616,00:24:14.286,What matters is that he is your best friend.
00:24:14.369,00:24:18.665,"And then this girl shows up and starts living in your basement, and all you ever want to do is pay attention to her."
00:24:18.748,00:24:21.251,"-That's not true. -Yes, it is. And you know it."
00:24:21.334,00:24:28.967,And he knows it. But no one ever says anything until you both start punching and yelling at each other like goblins with intelligence scores of zero.
00:24:29.092,00:24:31.761,-Now everything's weird. -He's not my best friend.
00:24:35.599,00:24:38.018,-And so is Will. -Can't have more than one best friend.
00:24:38.101,00:24:39.811,-Says who? -Says logic.
00:24:39.895,00:24:43.482,"Well, I call bull on your logic, because you're my best friend, too."
00:24:44.483,00:24:45.525,Okay.
00:24:50.155,00:24:51.156,Whoa.
00:25:14.137,00:25:16.515,"-MK Ultra? -Yeah, that's the one."
00:25:20.435,00:25:25.148,"By the time Terry got involved, it was supposed to be ramping down, but the drugs just got crazier."
00:25:25.232,00:25:26.775,Messed her up good.
00:25:26.900,00:25:29.194,This was the CIA that ran this?
00:25:31.112,00:25:34.950,"You and Terry would've gotten along. The Man, with a big capital M."
00:25:36.535,00:25:43.291,"a couple hundred bucks to people like my sister, give 'em drugs, psychedelics. LSD, mostly."
00:25:43.375,00:25:47.128,And then they'd strip her naked and put her in these isolation tanks.
00:25:49.130,00:25:53.885,"These big bathtubs, basically, filled with salt water, so you can float around in there."
00:25:53.969,00:25:56.638,"You lose any sense of, uh..."
00:25:56.721,00:26:00.517,"sense and feel nothing, see nothing."
00:26:00.600,00:26:03.895,They wanted to expand the boundaries of the mind.
00:26:04.020,00:26:05.355,Real hippie crap.
00:26:05.438,00:26:08.024,"I... I mean, it's not like they were forcing her to do any of this stuff."
00:26:08.108,00:26:11.528,"The thing is, though, is that she didn't know she was pregnant at the time."
00:26:11.611,00:26:13.113,Jane.
00:26:16.700,00:26:18.994,Do you have any pictures of her?
00:26:21.788,00:26:24.082,I don't think you guys understand.
00:26:25.000,00:26:27.377,Terry miscarried in the third trimester.
00:26:32.632,00:26:35.552,She keeps all of this up. Been doing it for 12 years.
00:26:37.679,00:26:49.065,"Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real, Says she's special. Born with abilities."
00:26:50.442,00:26:51.985,Abilities?
00:26:54.946,00:26:56.656,You read any Stephen King?
00:27:01.953,00:27:04.289,"You guys look scared, actually."
00:27:10.211,00:27:12.881,"Telepathy, telekinesis..."
00:27:14.716,00:27:16.801,"You know, shit you can do with your mind."
00:27:22.474,00:27:25.477,"Her baby's a weapon, off fighting the commies."
00:27:25.602,00:27:29.731,"You know, the doctors all say it's a coping mechanism."
00:27:29.814,00:27:31.524,"You know, to deal with the guilt."
00:27:31.608,00:27:34.569,Do you think there is any chance she could be telling the truth?
00:27:38.031,00:27:40.825,"There is no birth certificate, nothing from the hospital."
00:27:40.909,00:27:43.995,Doctors and nurses all confirm that she miscarried.
00:27:44.079,00:27:47.248,"Yeah, but that could've been covered up. Right?"
00:28:13.274,00:28:15.360,"Oh, man."
00:29:04.993,00:29:08.079,And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.
00:29:18.089,00:29:19.424,Um...
00:29:28.433,00:29:29.684,Monster hunting?
00:29:32.562,00:29:34.063,"You know, last week..."
00:29:34.689,00:29:37.984,I was shopping for a new top I thought Steve might like.
00:29:38.067,00:29:39.903,It took me and Barb all weekend.
00:29:39.986,00:29:46.493,"It seemed like life or death, you know? And... and now-- You're shopping for bear traps with Jonathan Byers."
00:29:47.410,00:29:48.536,Yeah.
00:29:49.746,00:29:51.039,What's the weirdest part?
00:29:51.956,00:29:53.374,Me or the bear trap?
00:29:54.292,00:29:56.628,You. It's definitely you.
00:30:03.593,00:30:04.969,What the hell was that?
00:30:06.429,00:30:07.764,I don't know.
00:30:11.392,00:30:12.519,What?
00:30:15.104,00:30:16.731,What?
00:30:16.856,00:30:18.441,Hey! Where are you going?
00:30:26.449,00:30:27.617,Nancy!
00:30:42.715,00:30:44.050,Wow.
00:31:01.234,00:31:03.111,"Aw, hey there, princess!"
00:31:09.409,00:31:10.743,What is wrong with you?
00:31:10.827,00:31:12.120,What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you?
00:31:12.203,00:31:13.746,I was worried about you.
00:31:15.999,00:31:19.252,-What are you talking about? -I wouldn't lie if I were you.
00:31:19.335,00:31:22.463,"You don't want to be known as the lying slut now, do you?"
00:31:25.049,00:31:26.092,Hi.
00:31:27.760,00:31:28.928,You came by last night?
00:31:29.470,00:31:32.557,Ding! Ding! Ding! Does she get a prize?
00:31:32.640,00:31:35.393,"Look, I don't know what you think you saw, but it wasn't like that."
00:31:35.476,00:31:38.855,"What, you just let him into your room to... study?"
00:31:43.234,00:31:44.819,Finish that sentence.
00:31:59.042,00:32:00.501,"Come on, Nancy, let's just leave."
00:32:00.585,00:32:02.128,"You know what, Byers? I'm actually kind of impressed."
00:32:02.211,00:32:05.840,"I always took you for a queer, but I guess you're just a little screw-up like your father."
00:32:05.924,00:32:08.593,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups."
00:32:08.676,00:32:10.178,"You know, I guess I shouldn't really be surprised."
00:32:10.261,00:32:11.471,A bunch of screw-ups in your family.
00:32:11.554,00:32:12.722,"-Jonathan, leave it. -I mean, your mom..."
00:32:12.805,00:32:14.641,I'm not even surprised what happened to your brother.
00:32:15.850,00:32:30.531,"I'm sorry I have to be the one to tell you, but the Byers, their family, it's a disgrace to the entire-- Stop! Steve! Knock it off, you guys!"
00:32:35.912,00:32:37.497,"-Get in there, he's going to hurt himself! -Easy, easy!"
00:32:37.580,00:32:40.333,Hey. Hey! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here!
00:32:44.295,00:32:46.756,"Jonathan, stop! Stop! You're going to hurt him!"
00:32:53.346,00:32:55.264,-Stop it! Come on! -Cops!
00:32:55.348,00:32:57.517,"-You have to stop! -Just go, Carol!"
00:32:59.143,00:33:00.770,"Hey, he's had enough, man! I said he's had enough!"
00:33:00.895,00:33:02.647,-Kids! All right! -Stop it!
00:33:10.363,00:33:14.242,"Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh. Come here, little guys! Come here!"
00:33:51.195,00:33:52.280,Hey...
00:33:55.575,00:33:57.035,We're gonna find him.
00:33:59.162,00:34:02.248,"Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?"
00:34:03.708,00:34:05.126,We're close.
00:34:10.298,00:34:13.259,"And then she shows up at Benny's five nights ago, which means we've got a chance."
00:34:13.342,00:34:15.053,You know what I would give?
00:34:16.095,00:34:18.347,For a chance?
00:34:18.431,00:34:20.141,You know what I would give?
00:34:22.685,00:34:24.854,"-Hey, Chief? -Yeah, go ahead."
00:34:24.979,00:34:30.026,"Yeah, a fight broke out here and-- -Cal, I don't have time for this. -It's Jonathan Byers."
00:34:30.109,00:34:32.153,"You haven't seen Joyce, have you?"
00:34:44.665,00:34:46.959,Do you think we'll be out of here soon?
00:34:47.043,00:34:49.170,"You, yes. Him, no."
00:34:49.253,00:34:51.464,He assaulted a police officer.
00:34:53.925,00:34:56.094,"You and your boyfriend have big plans, do you?"
00:34:58.471,00:35:00.973,I think you better tell him that.
00:35:01.682,00:35:02.725,What?
00:35:02.809,00:35:05.561,"Only love makes you that crazy, sweetheart."
00:35:06.604,00:35:08.481,And that damn stupid.
00:35:16.989,00:35:18.324,Found some ice.
00:35:20.701,00:35:21.869,Thanks.
00:35:35.591,00:35:36.926,Everything okay?
00:35:38.678,00:35:39.804,Yeah.
00:35:40.930,00:35:42.515,Everything's fine.
00:36:03.911,00:36:06.706,-Eleven! El! -El!
00:36:07.999,00:36:09.584,Eleven!
00:36:09.667,00:36:10.877,Eleven!
00:36:13.921,00:36:16.799,"-Hey, stop. Do you hear that? -What?"
00:36:16.883,00:36:17.967,El!
00:36:18.968,00:36:20.011,El?
00:36:24.515,00:36:25.808,"Hey, there, Frogface."
00:36:26.726,00:36:27.768,Toothless.
00:36:27.852,00:36:29.729,"Shit! Run, Mike!"
00:36:29.812,00:36:31.856,-What? -Run! Come on!
00:36:35.985,00:36:37.570,"Mike, come on, run!"
00:37:58.567,00:37:59.735,Keep going!
00:38:05.866,00:38:07.326,Shit!
00:38:09.036,00:38:11.205,-Stay back! -Don't come any closer!
00:38:21.507,00:38:23.384,Let him go! Let him go!
00:38:23.467,00:38:26.429,"-Stay back, or I cut him! -What do you want?"
00:38:26.512,00:38:27.722,I want to know how you did it!
00:38:29.181,00:38:30.474,I know you did something to me.
00:38:30.558,00:38:32.435,Some nerdy science shit to make me do that.
00:38:32.601,00:38:33.811,You mean piss your pants?
00:38:34.895,00:38:38.983,"Our friend has superpowers, and she squeezed your tiny bladder with her mind."
00:38:40.526,00:38:42.862,I think I should save Toothless here a trip to the dentist.
00:38:42.945,00:38:44.655,Help him lose the rest of his baby teeth.
00:38:44.739,00:38:46.574,Let him go. Let him go!
00:38:46.657,00:38:48.868,"I'll let him go, sure."
00:38:51.329,00:38:52.455,My turn for what?
00:38:52.538,00:38:54.165,Wet yourself.
00:38:54.999,00:38:57.001,-What? -Jump...
00:38:57.084,00:38:59.545,or Toothless here gets an early trip to the dentist.
00:39:05.551,00:39:06.719,I'll cut him right now!
00:39:09.221,00:39:11.682,"All right, just hold on! Hold on!"
00:39:11.766,00:39:14.101,"Mike, don't do it. I don't need my baby teeth, Mike!"
00:39:14.226,00:39:16.103,"Mike, seriously, don't!"
00:39:35.956,00:39:38.793,"Seriously, don't do it, man! Seriously, don't!"
00:39:38.876,00:39:40.753,"Troy, I don't think this is a good idea, man."
00:39:46.967,00:39:49.387,Four! Three!
00:39:51.138,00:39:53.265,-Two! -Mike!
00:40:03.901,00:40:05.111,Holy shit.
00:40:48.946,00:40:49.989,Go.
00:40:53.993,00:40:55.911,"Yeah, that's right! You better run!"
00:40:59.206,00:41:01.584,You come back here and she'll kill you!
00:41:01.667,00:41:05.588,"You hear me? She'll kill you, you sons of bitches!"
00:42:25.251,00:42:26.835,El?
00:42:30.756,00:42:33.217,Sorry? What are you sorry for?
00:42:39.557,00:42:40.975,I opened it.
00:42:44.645,00:42:46.063,I'm the monster.
00:42:47.481,00:42:50.150,"No. No, El, you're not the monster."
00:42:50.234,00:42:51.819,You saved me.
00:42:51.902,00:42:54.780,Do you understand? You saved me.
00:43:34.612,00:43:38.282,I have eyes on 'em now. They're heading home.
00:00:19.644,00:00:21.229,You don't need it.
00:00:24.107,00:00:25.525,Still pretty?
00:00:25.608,00:00:27.402,Yeah!
00:00:27.485,00:00:29.362,Pretty. Really pretty.
00:00:35.702,00:00:36.703,El?
00:00:37.871,00:00:38.997,Yes?
00:00:44.085,00:00:45.837,"Me, too."
00:00:57.682,00:00:59.559,Do you remember how he said he was looking for the gate?
00:01:04.314,00:01:05.356,What's he saying?
00:01:05.440,00:01:07.484,"I don't know, he's way out of range."
00:01:09.611,00:01:12.739,"Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down. We can't understand you."
00:01:12.822,00:01:15.408,"Yes, I copy! Do you?"
00:01:15.492,00:01:17.243,They know about Eleven!
00:01:17.327,00:01:19.370,Get out of there! They know about Eleven!
00:01:19.454,00:01:21.956,The bad men are coming! All of them!
00:01:22.040,00:01:24.709,Do you hear me? The bad men are coming!
00:01:24.793,00:01:26.461,Mad hen. Does that mean anything to you?
00:01:26.544,00:01:27.879,Like a code name or something?
00:01:44.813,00:01:46.731,You don't think...
00:01:48.566,00:01:52.237,"Well, I know she and Steve have been spending some time together, -so I thought maybe-- -Mom!"
00:01:54.197,00:01:55.240,-Maybe you could ask him? -Mom!
00:01:55.323,00:01:56.616,"I'm sorry, can you just hold on, please?"
00:01:56.699,00:02:00.829,"Michael, I'm on the phone. I've told you a million times-- -Did you schedule any repairs? -What?"
00:02:00.912,00:02:03.581,Is there anyone supposed to come and do repairs on the house?
00:02:14.050,00:02:31.609,"I don't understand. Is there something wrong-- If anyone asks where I am, I've left the country."
00:02:31.693,00:02:32.777,What?
00:03:11.065,00:03:12.358,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
00:03:14.903,00:03:16.779,"Dustin, do you copy?"
00:03:16.863,00:03:18.698,"Yeah, Lucas, they're on us."
00:03:18.781,00:03:20.408,-Where are you? -Cornwallis.
00:03:20.491,00:03:21.784,Meet me at Elm and Cherry!
00:03:21.868,00:03:23.494,Copy. Elm and Cherry!
00:03:23.578,00:03:24.787,Okay.
00:03:32.420,00:03:34.213,"-Shit! -This way, come on!"
00:03:39.469,00:03:40.595,Out of the way!
00:03:59.197,00:04:01.532,"-Faster, faster! -Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!"
00:04:52.542,00:04:54.127,Holy... holy shit!
00:04:54.210,00:04:56.587,Did... did you see what she did to that van?
00:04:56.671,00:04:57.755,"No, Dustin, we missed it."
00:05:02.427,00:05:04.095,It was awesome.
00:05:10.977,00:05:14.814,Everything I said about you being a traitor and stuff...
00:05:16.107,00:05:17.525,I was wrong.
00:05:20.862,00:05:22.363,I'm sorry.
00:05:26.909,00:05:28.077,Friends...
00:05:29.329,00:05:30.872,friends don't lie.
00:07:08.094,00:07:09.137,Hey.
00:07:09.220,00:07:11.681,"Jonathan? Jesus, what... what happened?"
00:07:14.559,00:07:16.686,"Well, your boy assaulted a police officer. That's why."
00:07:16.769,00:07:19.063,-Take them off. -I am afraid I cannot do that.
00:07:19.147,00:07:21.232,-Take them off! -You heard her. Take 'em off.
00:07:21.315,00:07:26.779,"Chief, I get everyone's emotional here, but there's something you need to see."
00:07:33.703,00:07:34.787,What is this?
00:07:34.871,00:07:36.456,Why don't you ask your son? We found it in his car.
00:07:38.249,00:07:40.042,Is that really the question you should be asking right now?
00:07:40.543,00:07:42.211,I wanna see you in my office.
00:07:42.295,00:07:43.629,You won't believe me.
00:07:49.010,00:07:51.512,Mike? Mike?
00:08:12.700,00:08:14.827,"Yeah, just a minute, please!"
00:08:19.499,00:08:20.958,Hold your horses.
00:08:24.962,00:08:26.005,Mr. Wheeler?
00:08:26.088,00:08:27.715,Yes?
00:09:11.634,00:09:14.011,You think my son is hiding this girl?
00:09:14.095,00:09:15.221,What happened to her hair?
00:09:15.304,00:09:17.848,We just need to know if you've seen her in the past week.
00:09:17.932,00:09:21.143,"-No, no. -Absolutely not."
00:09:21.227,00:09:22.937,Our son with a girl?
00:09:25.398,00:09:28.734,"if he had a girl sleeping in this house, we'd know about it."
00:09:31.571,00:09:33.322,This girl...
00:09:34.532,00:09:36.284,I'm afraid I can't answer that.
00:09:37.743,00:09:40.871,-You can't treat us like this. -I need you to stay calm.
00:09:40.955,00:09:48.462,"You come into my house, and you tell me that my son is hiding some girl, and that he's in danger, but you can't tell us why?"
00:09:48.546,00:09:51.382,"And you, what, you expect me to remain, what, calm?"
00:10:02.685,00:10:05.062,I understand how upsetting this is.
00:10:06.105,00:10:08.357,I wish we could tell you more...
00:10:09.692,00:10:14.739,"but I can tell you that your son, Michael, is in real danger."
00:10:17.283,00:10:18.659,We want to help him.
00:10:18.743,00:10:21.537,We will help him. I give you my word.
00:10:23.372,00:10:25.499,But in order for me to do that...
00:10:27.126,00:10:28.919,you have to trust me.
00:10:31.380,00:10:33.049,Will you trust me?
00:10:38.721,00:10:40.014,Good.
00:10:40.097,00:10:41.265,Now...
00:10:43.184,00:10:45.645,do you have any idea where your son might have gone?
00:10:53.069,00:10:56.614,"The fence starts here, and goes all the way around."
00:10:57.531,00:10:59.659,And this is the lab right here.
00:10:59.742,00:11:01.202,The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.
00:11:01.285,00:11:02.328,It's gotta be.
00:11:04.372,00:11:05.790,The sign says Department of Energy.
00:11:05.873,00:11:08.000,Department of Energy? What do you think that means?
00:11:08.084,00:11:10.044,It means government. Military.
00:11:12.380,00:11:13.839,It's military. My dad's told me before.
00:11:13.923,00:11:15.674,Mike's right. There's soldiers out front.
00:11:15.758,00:11:17.802,"Do they make, like, lightbulbs or something?"
00:11:19.178,00:11:20.679,"to fight the Russians, and commies and stuff."
00:11:25.851,00:11:28.646,Really bad. The place is like a fortress.
00:11:28.729,00:11:29.772,"Well, what do we do?"
00:11:31.607,00:11:33.025,We're fugitives now.
00:11:37.780,00:11:39.573,Do you hear that?
00:11:47.123,00:11:48.791,"-It's stuck. -Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
00:12:01.887,00:12:03.264,Mental.
00:12:10.354,00:12:12.189,You say blood draws this thing?
00:12:12.273,00:12:13.607,We don't know.
00:12:14.525,00:12:15.860,It's just a theory.
00:12:21.240,00:12:24.243,"What, you're sorry? You're... you're sorry?"
00:12:24.326,00:12:26.120,"-That is not good enough, Jonathan. -I know."
00:12:26.203,00:12:28.622,That's not even close. That's not even in the... in the ballpark.
00:12:28.706,00:12:32.626,"I wanted to tell you, I just-- What if this thing took you, too?"
00:12:32.710,00:12:36.005,You risked your life... and Nancy's.
00:12:39.633,00:12:42.011,This is not yours to fix alone.
00:12:47.016,00:12:48.142,You're not alone.
00:12:48.225,00:12:49.602,I know.
00:12:51.187,00:12:53.898,-I know. -Damn it.
00:13:02.573,00:13:04.408,"Ma'am, I need you to calm down."
00:13:04.492,00:13:05.659,"What is your name, Deputy?"
00:13:11.123,00:13:13.083,These men are humiliating my son.
00:13:13.167,00:13:15.169,"-No, no, no. Okay, that's not true. -Yes."
00:13:15.252,00:13:19.381,"There was some kind of fight, Chief-- A psychotic child broke his arm!"
00:13:19.465,00:13:22.718,"-A little girl, Chief. A little one. -That tone! Do you hear that tone?"
00:13:22.801,00:13:24.053,"Honestly, I'm just trying to state a fact."
00:13:24.136,00:13:32.728,-I don't have time for this. -It was a little girl-- She had no hair and she was bleeding from her nose.
00:13:32.811,00:13:34.730,Like a freak.
00:13:34.813,00:13:35.940,What'd you just say?
00:13:36.649,00:13:38.150,I said she's a freak!
00:13:38.234,00:13:41.028,"No, her hair. What'd you say about her hair?"
00:13:41.111,00:13:43.030,Her head's shaved.
00:13:43.113,00:13:44.865,She doesn't even look like a girl.
00:13:46.283,00:13:47.284,And...
00:13:48.035,00:13:49.119,And what?
00:13:50.454,00:13:52.206,"Tell the man, Troy."
00:13:54.375,00:13:55.876,She can...
00:13:58.254,00:13:59.421,do things.
00:13:59.505,00:14:01.799,What kind of things?
00:14:01.882,00:14:02.925,Like...
00:14:05.302,00:14:06.345,make you fly.
00:14:09.306,00:14:10.641,And piss yourself.
00:14:10.724,00:14:11.725,What?
00:14:13.310,00:14:14.311,Was she alone?
00:14:15.771,00:14:17.606,She always hangs out with those losers.
00:14:17.690,00:14:18.857,Losers?
00:14:19.900,00:14:21.485,What losers?
00:14:25.447,00:14:26.657,Hey.
00:14:27.783,00:14:29.285,You owe me $1.20.
00:14:31.078,00:14:33.414,"Don't worry, he'll need more than aspirin when we're done with him."
00:14:33.497,00:14:36.166,"Yeah, if the creep ever gets out."
00:14:36.250,00:14:37.835,The cops should just lock him up forever.
00:14:42.506,00:14:44.842,"He probably had that same look whenever he killed his brother, right?"
00:14:44.925,00:14:52.766,"Oh, God, I just got an image of him making that face Carol, for once in your life, shut your damn mouth!"
00:14:52.850,00:14:55.561,"-What? -Hey, what's your problem, man?"
00:14:57.313,00:14:58.981,You're both assholes. That's my problem.
00:14:59.064,00:15:00.399,"-Are you serious right now, man? -Yeah, I'm serious."
00:15:00.482,00:15:01.483,You shouldn't have done that.
00:15:01.567,00:15:02.860,-Done what? -You know what.
00:15:02.943,00:15:04.820,You mean call her out for what she really is?
00:15:04.904,00:15:07.156,"Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember you asking me to stop."
00:15:07.239,00:15:08.908,I should've put that spray paint right down your throat.
00:15:10.701,00:15:14.538,"neither of you ever cared about her. You never even liked her, because she's not miserable like you two."
00:15:14.622,00:15:16.040,She actually cares about other people.
00:15:16.123,00:15:17.374,The slut with a heart of gold.
00:15:17.458,00:15:18.667,I told you to watch your mouth!
00:15:18.751,00:15:23.422,"Hey! I don't know what's gotten into you, man, -but you don't talk to her that way. -Get out of my face."
00:15:25.090,00:15:26.175,Or what?
00:15:26.258,00:15:27.843,"You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?"
00:15:27.927,00:15:29.011,"You gonna fight me now, too?"
00:15:32.389,00:15:35.225,so I wouldn't recommend that.
00:15:44.485,00:15:47.279,"That's right. Run away, Stevie boy!"
00:15:47.363,00:15:49.865,Run away! Just like you always do.
00:15:49.949,00:15:53.285,That Nancy's turning you into a little pussy!
00:16:10.636,00:16:12.137,"No, you can't."
00:16:17.643,00:16:19.520,"-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. -Let go."
00:16:19.603,00:16:21.230,-Let go! -Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.
00:16:21.313,00:16:24.566,The last thing in the world we need is them knowing you're mixed up in all this.
00:16:24.650,00:16:27.194,-Mike is over there-- -They haven't found him.
00:16:27.277,00:16:28.570,"Not yet, at least."
00:16:31.240,00:16:32.908,"-For Mike? -Come on, get in the car."
00:16:36.078,00:16:38.372,"Look, we need to find them before they do."
00:16:38.455,00:16:39.790,Do you have any idea where he might have gone?
00:16:39.873,00:16:42.668,"-No, I don't. -I need you to think."
00:16:42.751,00:16:44.461,I don't know. We haven't talked a lot.
00:16:46.463,00:16:47.631,Is there any place that your...
00:16:47.715,00:16:49.675,your parents don't know about that he might go?
00:16:51.969,00:16:53.053,What?
00:16:53.137,00:16:57.141,"I don't know where he is, but I think I know how to ask him."
00:17:06.442,00:17:07.609,Whoa.
00:17:15.409,00:17:16.702,I got it.
00:17:29.757,00:17:31.884,"Mike, it's me, Nancy."
00:17:34.178,00:17:35.637,"Mike, are you there?"
00:17:35.721,00:17:37.389,Answer.
00:17:37.473,00:17:39.141,"Mike, we need you to answer."
00:17:39.224,00:17:40.768,Is that your sister?
00:17:41.727,00:17:44.396,"This is an emergency, Mike."
00:17:44.480,00:17:45.773,Do you copy?
00:17:47.024,00:17:48.442,"Mike, do you copy?"
00:17:48.525,00:17:50.069,"Okay, this is really weird."
00:17:50.152,00:17:51.653,Don't answer.
00:17:53.906,00:17:56.658,-It's your sister! -What if the bad people kidnapped her?
00:17:56.742,00:17:59.620,-What if they're forcing her to say this? -I need you to answer.
00:18:02.331,00:18:04.083,"We need to know that you're there, Mike."
00:18:04.792,00:18:07.628,"Listen, kid, this is the chief. If you're there, pick up."
00:18:07.711,00:18:09.713,We know you're in trouble and we know about the girl.
00:18:09.797,00:18:11.840,Why is she with the chief?
00:18:11.924,00:18:13.217,How the hell does he know about...
00:18:17.304,00:18:19.932,Are you there? Do you copy? Over.
00:18:27.064,00:18:28.857,Anybody got any other ideas?
00:18:33.946,00:18:34.988,It's Mike.
00:18:35.072,00:18:36.406,I'm here.
00:18:38.784,00:18:40.035,We're here.
00:18:52.798,00:18:54.424,Did you have something to do with this?
00:18:55.425,00:18:56.593,I just...
00:18:57.594,00:18:58.762,I wanna help.
00:19:07.104,00:19:08.480,All yours.
00:19:25.164,00:19:26.790,We should be out there looking for him.
00:19:26.874,00:19:29.668,"Honey, we have to trust them, okay?"
00:19:29.751,00:19:32.546,This is our government. They're on our side.
00:19:35.048,00:19:36.550,That man gives me the creeps.
00:19:39.094,00:19:40.262,Nancy.
00:19:40.345,00:19:42.806,"You don't think she's involved in this, too, do you?"
00:19:42.890,00:19:44.308,Nancy with Mike?
00:20:00.449,00:20:01.783,Will you stop pacing?
00:20:01.867,00:20:03.827,It's been way too long.
00:20:03.911,00:20:08.624,Do you know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe this is all a trap and the bad men are coming to get us right now!
00:20:08.707,00:20:09.708,It's not a trap.
00:20:09.791,00:20:11.793,Why would the chief set us up?
00:20:11.877,00:20:14.046,"Nancy, maybe, but the chief?"
00:20:14.129,00:20:15.505,Lando Calrissian.
00:20:15.589,00:20:17.257,Would you shut up about Lando?
00:20:17.341,00:20:19.259,I don't feel good about this. I don't feel good about this!
00:20:39.696,00:20:41.448,You think they saw us?
00:20:41.531,00:20:43.200,"Both of you, shut up."
00:21:41.633,00:21:43.260,Let's go!
00:22:06.450,00:22:08.785,"Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!"
00:22:12.622,00:22:14.666,I was so worried about you.
00:22:14.750,00:22:17.169,"Yeah, uh... me, too."
00:22:22.549,00:22:23.884,Is that my dress?
00:22:27.262,00:22:30.557,"Okay, so, in this example, we're the acrobat."
00:22:30.640,00:22:33.560,"Will and Barbara, and that monster, they're this flea."
00:22:33.643,00:22:36.021,"And this is the Upside Down, where Will is hiding."
00:22:39.649,00:22:41.234,-A gate. -That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.
00:22:41.318,00:22:42.611,With our compasses.
00:22:44.571,00:22:50.118,"Okay, so the gate has a really strong electromagnetic field, and that can change the directions of a compass needle."
00:22:50.202,00:22:51.411,Is this gate underground?
00:22:54.498,00:22:56.249,Near a large water tank?
00:22:56.958,00:22:58.126,Yes.
00:23:01.838,00:23:03.632,He's seen it.
00:23:06.843,00:23:10.472,that you could reach Will? That you could talk to him in this-- The Upside Down.
00:23:15.060,00:23:16.520,"Can you find her, too?"
00:23:52.806,00:23:53.849,I'm sorry.
00:23:53.932,00:23:54.975,What?
00:24:35.807,00:24:38.351,"The more energy she uses, the more tired she gets."
00:24:38.435,00:24:41.021,"-Like, she flipped the van earlier. -It was awesome."
00:24:46.443,00:24:49.279,We don't. We just have to wait and try again.
00:24:51.281,00:24:52.657,I don't know.
00:24:57.954,00:24:59.623,I can find them.
00:25:01.124,00:25:02.167,In the bath.
00:25:10.717,00:25:12.969,"Oh. Oh, my... No, mmm-mmm."
00:25:13.053,00:25:15.055,"Hey, you know how they did that? You know what that is?"
00:25:16.473,00:25:19.017,Melted plastic and microwaved bubble gum.
00:25:21.061,00:25:22.604,Really.
00:25:25.106,00:25:27.067,-What in the world? -Do you want me to pause it?
00:25:27.150,00:25:28.735,I'm sure it's just a wrong number.
00:25:31.696,00:25:32.739,Hello?
00:25:32.822,00:25:34.616,Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.
00:25:34.699,00:25:37.577,Dustin? Is everything okay?
00:25:37.661,00:25:39.287,"Yeah, yeah. I just, I..."
00:25:39.371,00:25:41.456,I have a science question.
00:25:41.539,00:25:47.963,It's ten o'clock on Saturday. Why don't we pick this up-- Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks?
00:25:48.046,00:25:49.839,Specifically how to build one?
00:25:53.593,00:25:55.178,Fun.
00:25:55.262,00:25:56.930,Okay. Well...
00:25:57.847,00:26:00.183,"Why don't we talk about it Monday? After school, okay?"
00:26:00.267,00:26:02.727,You always say we should never stop being curious.
00:26:02.811,00:26:04.729,To always open any curiosity door we find.
00:26:04.813,00:26:08.566,Dustin-- Why are you keeping this curiosity door locked?
00:26:11.194,00:26:12.404,Uh-huh.
00:26:16.032,00:26:17.450,Uh-huh. How much?
00:26:18.368,00:26:19.411,Uh-huh.
00:26:20.704,00:26:23.498,"Yep, all right. Yeah, we'll be careful."
00:26:23.581,00:26:25.208,"Definitely. All right, Mr. Clarke."
00:26:25.292,00:26:27.502,"Yeah, I'll see you on Monday. I'll see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke."
00:26:27.585,00:26:28.962,Bye.
00:26:29.045,00:26:31.339,Do you still have that kiddie pool we bobbed for apples in?
00:26:31.423,00:26:33.717,-I think so. Yeah. -Yeah.
00:26:33.800,00:26:35.468,Good. Then we just need salt. Lots of it.
00:26:35.552,00:26:37.262,How much is lots?
00:26:39.347,00:26:40.432,"1,500 pounds."
00:26:41.141,00:26:43.226,"Well, where are we gonna get that much salt?"
00:26:57.949,00:26:59.326,"Hey, wait."
00:26:59.409,00:27:01.369,"It's not gonna snow next week, is it?"
00:27:03.621,00:27:06.333,Even if we find Will in there...
00:27:06.416,00:27:07.959,what are we gonna do about that thing?
00:27:08.043,00:27:09.336,We're not gonna do anything.
00:27:09.419,00:27:10.837,"I don't want you anywhere near this, all right?"
00:27:10.920,00:27:13.340,-Your mom's been through enough already. -He's my brother.
00:27:13.423,00:27:16.760,Listen to me. I'm gonna find him. All right?
00:27:18.470,00:27:20.180,I am going to find him.
00:27:34.903,00:27:36.654,Come on. It's upside down.
00:27:40.867,00:27:42.035,"-Okay, um... -How does this even work?"
00:27:44.704,00:27:46.706,-Pull it back. Pull it back. -I am!
00:27:49.501,00:27:50.835,Shit!
00:28:08.478,00:28:10.105,Whoa.
00:28:30.375,00:28:32.210,She really likes Eggos.
00:28:35.588,00:28:37.632,I thought it was because of Will.
00:28:37.715,00:28:40.593,"I knew you were acting weird, too. I thought it was 'cause of Steve."
00:28:42.011,00:28:43.096,Hey...
00:28:45.223,00:28:47.016,"No more secrets, okay?"
00:28:47.100,00:28:49.144,From now on we tell each other everything.
00:28:49.227,00:28:52.272,Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?
00:28:52.355,00:28:54.315,What? No.
00:28:55.275,00:28:58.069,"No, it's... it's not... it's not like that."
00:28:59.654,00:29:00.905,Do you like Eleven?
00:29:00.989,00:29:04.325,What? No. Ew. Gross.
00:29:17.213,00:29:20.508,This will keep it dark for you.
00:29:20.592,00:29:22.677,Just like in your bathtub.
00:29:25.805,00:29:27.515,You're a very brave girl.
00:29:27.599,00:29:29.392,"You know that, don't you?"
00:29:30.435,00:29:34.397,Everything you're doing for my boy... for Will...
00:29:35.899,00:29:37.484,for my family...
00:29:45.325,00:29:46.576,Listen.
00:29:47.160,00:29:50.955,I am gonna be there with you the whole time.
00:29:51.039,00:29:52.999,And if it ever gets too scary...
00:30:00.507,00:30:01.549,Yes.
00:30:04.219,00:30:05.261,Ready?
00:30:10.183,00:30:11.226,Ready.
00:30:28.618,00:30:30.203,Colder!
00:30:32.163,00:30:33.456,Warmer!
00:30:35.792,00:30:37.252,Right there!
00:32:55.098,00:32:56.140,Barb?
00:32:56.224,00:32:57.475,Barbara?
00:33:28.840,00:33:30.883,-What's going on? -I don't know.
00:33:31.843,00:33:34.887,Is Barb okay? Is she okay?
00:33:37.056,00:33:38.808,Gone!
00:33:38.891,00:33:41.561,Gone! Gone!
00:33:41.644,00:33:43.938,Gone. Gone.
00:33:49.861,00:33:51.279,Gone!
00:33:53.197,00:33:55.700,"It's okay, we're right here. We're right here, honey."
00:33:59.120,00:34:01.956,Don't be afraid.
00:34:02.040,00:34:03.541,I'm right here with you.
00:34:03.624,00:34:06.169,I'm right here with you.
00:34:06.252,00:34:08.421,It's okay. It's okay.
00:34:10.882,00:34:13.009,"It's okay, you're safe."
00:34:13.092,00:34:14.469,"You're okay, honey."
00:34:17.555,00:34:18.931,Castle Byers.
00:34:58.346,00:34:59.388,Will.
00:35:06.729,00:35:08.731,You tell him... tell him I'm coming.
00:35:23.704,00:35:26.707,"We're coming. We're coming, okay? We're coming, honey."
00:35:26.791,00:35:29.043,Just... just hold on a little longer.
00:35:29.127,00:35:31.212,Will. Will.
00:35:42.431,00:35:43.558,Will?
00:35:44.475,00:35:45.560,Will!
00:35:58.281,00:35:59.323,I've got you.
00:36:00.783,00:36:02.618,It's okay. I got you. I got you.
00:36:03.244,00:36:05.872,"I got you, honey. You did so good."
00:36:15.840,00:36:18.259,"Yeah, he used to go there to hide."
00:36:24.015,00:36:25.266,"Hey, get back inside."
00:36:25.349,00:36:26.475,"What, are you insane?"
00:36:30.855,00:36:31.981,Are you kidding me?
00:36:32.064,00:36:35.318,"He's my son, Hop. My son."
00:36:35.401,00:36:36.485,I'm going!
00:36:39.405,00:36:40.740,"-...and watch over the kids. -No, Mom."
00:36:40.823,00:36:42.658,"-I can help. -Please, I need you to stay, Jonathan."
00:36:42.742,00:36:43.743,Joyce!
00:36:43.826,00:36:44.994,"-Please. -Please, be careful."
00:36:46.704,00:36:48.456,I'm gonna find him.
00:37:28.246,00:37:33.834,Your mom and Hopper are just walking in there like bait.
00:37:34.919,00:37:37.838,That thing is still in there.
00:37:39.882,00:37:43.261,"And we can't just sit here and let it get them, too."
00:37:43.344,00:37:44.637,We can't.
00:37:51.727,00:37:54.063,I wanna finish what we started.
00:37:55.773,00:37:57.650,I want to kill it.
00:38:12.164,00:38:13.708,So this is your plan?
00:38:13.791,00:38:15.501,"Worked for me before, didn't it?"
00:38:15.584,00:38:17.795,"-Well, did it? -Come on, trust me."
00:38:21.090,00:38:23.092,I think we're dealing with a whole different environment here.
00:38:24.927,00:38:27.221,on the Russians massing the fire and we...
00:38:48.784,00:38:50.244,It's all right.
00:38:50.328,00:38:51.704,Let me do the talking.
00:00:25.483,00:00:27.610,"Somebody, please!"
00:00:30.655,00:00:32.824,Let me out!
00:00:55.638,00:00:57.932,We know you've been in contact with him.
00:01:04.230,00:01:06.775,and how did you make contact with him?
00:01:08.109,00:01:09.569,-What? -Hmm?
00:01:11.613,00:01:12.864,Six.
00:01:13.948,00:01:15.241,What?
00:01:16.659,00:01:17.869,Six.
00:01:19.412,00:01:22.165,Six people have been taken this week.
00:01:23.374,00:01:26.795,This... thing that took your son...
00:01:30.924,00:01:33.426,But its behavior is predictable.
00:01:34.469,00:01:37.597,Like all animals...
00:01:39.682,00:01:40.934,it eats.
00:01:42.477,00:01:44.187,It will take more sons.
00:01:45.230,00:01:46.272,More daughters.
00:01:47.649,00:01:48.942,I want to save them.
00:01:50.568,00:01:52.487,I want to save your son.
00:01:53.988,00:01:55.156,But I can't do that.
00:01:56.074,00:01:57.325,Not without your help.
00:01:57.408,00:01:58.618,Stop.
00:02:02.497,00:02:04.290,I know who you are.
00:02:04.958,00:02:06.835,I know what you've done.
00:02:08.128,00:02:11.131,You took my boy away from me!
00:02:11.214,00:02:14.968,You left him in that place to die!
00:02:15.051,00:02:17.053,You faked his death!
00:02:20.348,00:02:22.725,We buried him.
00:02:23.893,00:02:26.896,And now you're asking for my help?
00:02:31.025,00:02:32.569,Go to hell.
00:02:41.202,00:02:42.787,I'm sorry.
00:02:43.872,00:02:44.873,Did I stutter?
00:02:46.499,00:02:48.001,I told you.
00:02:48.084,00:02:49.460,Everything.
00:02:53.298,00:02:55.133,What do you know?
00:02:56.801,00:03:01.598,"I know you do experiments on kidnapped little kids, whose parents' brains you've turned to mush."
00:03:02.473,00:03:06.269,And I know you went a little too far this time and you messed up in a big way.
00:03:07.270,00:03:10.398,"I mean, you really messed up, didn't you? Big time."
00:03:10.481,00:03:12.400,That's why you're trying to cover your tracks.
00:03:16.529,00:03:18.948,You made it look like that little girl just ran away.
00:03:19.032,00:03:20.450,"See, I told you."
00:03:21.701,00:03:24.120,"-I know everything. -All right, who are you working with?"
00:03:24.954,00:03:26.414,Nobody.
00:03:26.497,00:03:28.666,But I did give all this over to my friend at the Times.
00:03:39.344,00:03:40.929,You're just a junkie.
00:03:41.012,00:03:44.724,A small town cop who had a really bad week.
00:03:44.807,00:03:47.060,Took one too many pills this time.
00:03:50.772,00:03:52.941,You made a mistake coming back here.
00:03:53.024,00:03:54.609,"No, I didn't."
00:03:56.486,00:03:57.946,Here's what's gonna happen.
00:03:59.656,00:04:01.574,You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go...
00:04:02.825,00:04:06.996,"you're gonna give us anything we need, and we're gonna find her son."
00:04:08.081,00:04:11.793,And then we're gonna forget that any of this ever happened.
00:04:11.876,00:04:14.003,"Oh, is that right?"
00:04:15.421,00:04:16.589,Yeah.
00:04:18.383,00:04:19.759,That's right.
00:04:33.231,00:04:35.483,Nancy? Jonathan?
00:04:42.365,00:04:44.450,-They're gone. -What?
00:04:44.534,00:04:45.827,Nancy and Jonathan. His car's gone.
00:04:45.910,00:04:47.453,They're probably just sucking face somewhere.
00:04:49.539,00:04:50.623,Did they go with the chief?
00:04:50.707,00:04:51.708,I don't know.
00:04:52.417,00:04:53.418,No.
00:04:54.252,00:04:56.796,What? Did you see them? Do you know where they went?
00:04:58.131,00:05:00.091,-Yes. -Where? Where did they go?
00:05:02.885,00:05:04.220,Demogorgon.
00:06:52.245,00:06:53.871,Where's the girl?
00:07:01.462,00:07:03.339,You gotta give me your word.
00:07:05.174,00:07:07.426,Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.
00:07:08.719,00:07:12.181,"And those other three kids, those boys, you're gonna leave them alone."
00:07:14.600,00:07:16.310,Then I'll tell you.
00:07:18.771,00:07:21.607,Tell you where your little science experiment is.
00:07:46.716,00:07:48.134,I don't understand.
00:07:48.217,00:07:49.886,We came to an agreement.
00:07:49.969,00:07:51.554,What?
00:07:51.637,00:07:55.683,"Look, everything that's happened here and everything that's gonna happen, we don't talk about."
00:07:55.766,00:07:56.976,You want Will back?
00:07:58.060,00:07:59.687,This place had nothing to do with it.
00:08:00.730,00:08:03.316,That's the deal. You got it?
00:08:12.700,00:08:14.243,What is this?
00:08:14.327,00:08:17.163,Protection. The atmosphere is toxic.
00:08:19.707,00:08:20.833,Put it on.
00:08:39.810,00:08:41.562,And if they find the boy?
00:08:41.646,00:08:43.231,That's not gonna happen.
00:11:08.209,00:11:10.795,"I want you to slow down your breathing, take deep breaths."
00:11:10.878,00:11:12.963,In and out.
00:11:14.465,00:11:15.758,Deep breath in...
00:11:16.759,00:11:17.843,and out.
00:11:18.803,00:11:21.472,In and out.
00:11:22.264,00:11:25.810,-In and out. -It's troll's favorite food!
00:11:27.645,00:11:31.690,"-Roasted princess with paprika and gravy! -No! No, Daddy. No, Daddy."
00:11:36.195,00:11:37.530,Hey.
00:11:39.073,00:11:40.366,-What's going on? -Whoa.
00:11:40.449,00:11:42.535,-What happened? What happened? -I don't know. I don't know.
00:11:43.577,00:11:45.037,"Hey, you all right?"
00:11:45.121,00:11:46.163,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:11:50.334,00:11:53.045,"In and out. Slow, slow, slow."
00:11:56.715,00:11:57.716,In...
00:12:01.846,00:12:02.972,Yeah.
00:12:23.701,00:12:24.743,Remember...
00:12:24.827,00:12:27.580,-Straight into Will's room. And-- -Don't step on the trap.
00:12:27.663,00:12:29.081,Wait for the yo-yo to move.
00:12:29.165,00:12:30.624,Then...
00:12:32.460,00:12:33.586,All right.
00:12:34.503,00:12:35.504,You ready?
00:12:37.256,00:12:38.299,Ready.
00:12:42.470,00:12:43.554,One...
00:12:47.475,00:12:49.560,"You don't have to do this-- Jonathan, stop talking."
00:12:49.643,00:12:50.811,"-I'm just saying, you don't have to-- -Three."
00:12:54.607,00:12:55.900,We can't just wait around.
00:12:55.983,00:12:58.277,"Mike, in case you forgot, we're still fugitives."
00:12:58.360,00:12:59.737,The bad men are still looking for us.
00:12:59.820,00:13:01.697,"Yeah, and we don't even know where your sister is."
00:13:01.780,00:13:02.781,El can find them.
00:13:02.865,00:13:03.866,"Mike, look at her."
00:13:04.825,00:13:06.619,I still think we should stick to the chief's plan.
00:13:06.702,00:13:10.289,"Exactly. We stay here, keep El out of sight and keep her safe."
00:13:10.372,00:13:12.166,"That's the most important thing, remember?"
00:13:12.249,00:13:14.168,"Besides, she's okay. She's with Jonathan."
00:13:14.251,00:13:16.670,"Yeah, and she's kind of a badass now, so..."
00:13:17.630,00:13:20.049,"Well, where are you going? You just said stick to the plan!"
00:13:20.132,00:13:22.510,I am. I'm just gonna go get some chocolate pudding.
00:13:22.593,00:13:24.678,"I'm telling you, Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit."
00:13:26.096,00:13:27.765,El needs to be recharged!
00:13:48.702,00:13:49.995,Did you hear that?
00:13:52.748,00:13:54.250,It's just the wind.
00:13:59.922,00:14:01.382,Don't worry.
00:14:01.465,00:14:04.802,"My mom, she said the lights speak when it comes."
00:14:04.885,00:14:05.970,Speak?
00:14:06.637,00:14:08.097,Blink.
00:14:08.180,00:14:10.266,Think of them as alarms.
00:14:19.316,00:14:20.818,Is that too tight?
00:14:23.279,00:14:24.488,Thanks.
00:14:35.958,00:14:37.042,Nancy?
00:14:39.003,00:14:40.504,Yeah?
00:14:46.552,00:14:48.888,"Are you there, man? It's... it's Steve!"
00:14:49.680,00:14:51.473,"Listen, I just want to talk!"
00:14:54.810,00:14:58.689,"-Steve, listen to me. -Hey. Nancy, what-- -You need to leave. -I'm not trying to start anything, okay?"
00:14:58.772,00:14:59.940,I don't care about that. You need to leave.
00:15:03.444,00:15:05.112,I messed... I messed up.
00:15:05.195,00:15:06.196,Okay?
00:15:06.280,00:15:08.032,Really. Please.
00:15:08.115,00:15:09.658,I just want to make things right.
00:15:10.826,00:15:13.037,Okay? Please. Please...
00:15:15.247,00:15:16.540,"Hey, what happened to your hand?"
00:15:19.793,00:15:21.670,"-Yeah, what's going on? -Nothing."
00:15:21.754,00:15:23.547,-Wait a sec. Did he do this to you? -No.
00:15:23.631,00:15:25.925,"-Nancy, let me in! -No. No! No, Steve!"
00:15:27.259,00:15:28.969,-What is... What the... -You need to get out of here.
00:15:29.053,00:15:32.473,"-Whoa. What is all-- -Listen to me. I'm not asking you, -I'm telling you, get out of here! -What is that smell?"
00:15:32.556,00:15:33.974,"-Is that... is that gasoline? -Steve, get out!"
00:15:36.852,00:15:38.145,You have five seconds to get out of here.
00:15:38.228,00:15:39.647,"Okay, is this a joke? Stop. Put the gun down."
00:15:39.730,00:15:41.523,-I'm doing this for you. -Nancy.
00:15:41.607,00:15:42.775,-Wait. Is this a... What is this? -Nancy.
00:15:42.858,00:15:44.860,"-Three. Two. -No, no, no! No, no!"
00:15:44.944,00:15:46.654,Nancy! The lights.
00:15:50.699,00:15:52.201,-Easy with that! -Where is it?
00:15:52.284,00:15:53.369,I don't know. I don't see it.
00:15:53.452,00:15:54.453,Where is what?
00:15:54.536,00:16:04.922,Hello? Will someone please explain to me what the hell is going-- Go! Go! Run! Go!
00:16:13.097,00:16:14.890,Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?
00:16:26.360,00:16:27.528,I don't know.
00:16:43.544,00:16:44.545,No.
00:17:49.651,00:17:51.612,Will!
00:17:56.700,00:17:57.701,Will!
00:18:12.674,00:18:14.551,and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions.
00:18:14.635,00:18:16.428,She said I must have asked her a thousand already.
00:18:20.808,00:18:22.684,And what does make roads red?
00:18:22.768,00:18:24.520,"'Well, I don't know,' said Matthew."
00:18:24.603,00:18:27.231,It just makes me feel glad to be alive...
00:18:28.398,00:18:30.526,it's such an interesting world.
00:19:29.126,00:19:30.919,This is crazy. This is crazy. This is crazy.
00:19:31.003,00:19:33.255,This is crazy! This is crazy! This is crazy!
00:19:36.216,00:19:38.385,What are you do-- What are you doing? Are you insane?
00:19:38.468,00:19:39.636,It's going to come back!
00:19:41.555,00:19:43.432,Right now.
00:20:11.752,00:20:14.838,-You see it? -No. Where-- Come on.
00:20:15.797,00:20:17.549,Where are you? Come on!
00:20:28.101,00:20:29.645,Jonathan!
00:20:33.649,00:20:36.026,"Go to hell, you son of a bitch!"
00:21:18.860,00:21:20.320,Did you hear that?
00:21:50.976,00:21:52.394,It has to be dead.
00:23:15.644,00:23:16.645,Mom.
00:23:24.111,00:23:25.362,Jonathan?
00:23:42.379,00:23:44.131,Where's it going?
00:23:45.590,00:23:47.551,I don't think that's the monster.
00:23:52.848,00:23:55.225,Found it! I knew she was hoarding it.
00:23:55.308,00:23:56.643,-I knew it. -Yeah.
00:23:56.726,00:23:58.186,"Always lying, saying she's out."
00:23:58.270,00:23:59.855,Bald-faced liar.
00:23:59.938,00:24:03.233,"Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!"
00:24:03.316,00:24:04.693,Okay!
00:24:05.694,00:24:06.987,Are you feeling any better?
00:24:10.240,00:24:12.409,What's putting?
00:24:14.202,00:24:15.745,it's this chocolate goo you eat with a spoon.
00:24:16.288,00:24:21.293,"Don't worry, when all this is over, you won't have to keep eating junk food and leftovers like a dog anymore."
00:24:21.376,00:24:23.545,"My mom, she's a pretty awesome cook."
00:24:23.628,00:24:25.130,She can make you whatever you like.
00:24:25.213,00:24:26.506,Eggos?
00:24:26.590,00:24:29.843,"Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too."
00:24:32.262,00:24:39.603,"See, I was thinking, once all this is over and Will's back and you're not a secret anymore, my parents can get you an actual bed for the basement."
00:24:39.686,00:24:44.024,"Or you can take my room if you want, since I'm down there all the time anyways."
00:24:44.107,00:24:46.234,"My point is, they'll take care of you."
00:24:46.318,00:24:50.864,"They'll be like your new parents, and Nancy, she'll be like your new sister."
00:24:51.781,00:24:53.742,Will you be like my brother?
00:24:56.620,00:24:58.163,Why no?
00:25:01.833,00:25:03.084,Why?
00:25:07.172,00:25:08.590,It's stupid.
00:25:09.799,00:25:10.884,Mike?
00:25:10.967,00:25:12.135,Yeah?
00:25:12.219,00:25:14.346,Friends don't lie.
00:25:19.976,00:25:21.311,I don't know...
00:25:25.232,00:25:29.986,"-Snow Ball? -It's this cheesy school dance, where you go in the gym and dance to music and stuff."
00:25:33.657,00:25:35.575,-No? -I mean...
00:25:35.659,00:25:37.786,"you can, but it'd be really weird."
00:25:37.869,00:25:41.539,"You go to school dances with someone that, you know..."
00:25:42.332,00:25:44.125,someone that you like.
00:25:44.209,00:25:46.169,-A friend? -Not a friend.
00:25:49.631,00:25:51.299,"Uh, someone like a..."
00:26:07.482,00:26:09.317,"Nancy. Hold on, I'll be right back."
00:26:09.401,00:26:10.735,Stay here.
00:26:28.545,00:26:29.838,"You two, on me."
00:26:32.257,00:26:35.093,"This will charge your battery right up, I'm telling you."
00:26:44.519,00:26:46.646,"Be advised, west side of the building is clear."
00:27:00.368,00:27:02.037,Keep it locked down.
00:27:04.456,00:27:05.457,Kitchen.
00:27:11.755,00:27:12.797,How did they find us?
00:27:12.881,00:27:14.382,"I don't know, but they knew we were in the gym."
00:27:14.466,00:27:15.633,Lando.
00:27:56.883,00:27:58.009,El!
00:27:58.093,00:27:59.427,-Something's wrong. -She's just drained.
00:27:59.511,00:28:01.846,"No, no, no, she won't wake up. El!"
00:28:14.359,00:28:15.652,"Oh, my God."
00:29:16.212,00:29:18.173,-She's barely breathing. -We gotta go.
00:29:25.221,00:29:26.931,"You want her, you have to kill us first."
00:29:27.015,00:29:28.808,-That's right! -Eat shit!
00:29:28.892,00:29:30.685,"-Oh, no! No, no! -No! No! Get off me!"
00:29:37.317,00:29:39.569,"Eleven? Eleven, can you hear me?"
00:29:39.652,00:29:40.695,Eleven?
00:29:41.654,00:29:42.655,Papa?
00:29:42.739,00:29:45.200,"Yes, yes, it's your papa."
00:29:47.202,00:29:50.246,"Let her go! Let her go, you bastard!"
00:29:51.956,00:29:54.083,"Shh, shh, you're sick."
00:29:54.167,00:29:56.252,"You're sick, but I'm going to make you better."
00:29:56.336,00:30:00.173,"I'm going to take you back home, where I can make you well again."
00:30:00.256,00:30:04.177,"Where we can make all of this better, so no one else gets hurt."
00:30:08.598,00:30:09.682,Bad.
00:30:11.726,00:30:12.852,Bad.
00:30:17.524,00:30:19.776,Mike. Mike.
00:30:26.991,00:30:28.034,Blood.
00:30:28.117,00:30:29.327,What?
00:30:29.911,00:30:30.954,Blood.
00:30:49.973,00:30:51.057,Demogorgon.
00:32:34.160,00:32:36.454,Will! Will!
00:32:38.665,00:32:40.124,"Will! Oh, my God!"
00:32:40.208,00:32:42.543,Will! Hopper!
00:32:42.627,00:32:45.463,"Oh, my God! You need to help get him out!"
00:33:03.606,00:33:05.108,"Oh, Jesus."
00:33:13.908,00:33:16.160,"Sorry. Hold on, we're almost there. We're almost there."
00:33:22.667,00:33:24.043,"Help, help."
00:33:24.127,00:33:25.795,"Come on, get her on the table."
00:33:31.592,00:33:34.387,He's gone. The bad man's gone.
00:33:34.470,00:33:37.557,"We'll be home soon, and my mom..."
00:33:38.307,00:33:40.143,she'll get you your own bed.
00:33:40.351,00:33:42.729,You can eat as many Eggos as you want.
00:34:25.646,00:34:26.773,"Get the rocks, get the rocks, get the rocks!"
00:34:26.856,00:34:27.857,Getting the rocks!
00:34:29.400,00:34:30.735,-Go! Go! Kill it! Kill it! -Fire! Fire!
00:34:32.070,00:34:33.780,-Give me another one. -Kill it! Bastard!
00:34:36.032,00:34:38.201,"Get, get, get... Come on, kill the bastard!"
00:34:38.284,00:34:39.285,It's not working!
00:34:39.368,00:34:41.120,-Hit him again. -Kill him!
00:34:43.247,00:34:45.291,"-Come on, kill it! -Come on! Go, go, go!"
00:35:41.848,00:35:43.182,"Goodbye, Mike."
00:36:03.119,00:36:04.203,No more.
00:36:57.381,00:36:59.675,El? El?
00:37:04.555,00:37:06.057,"El, where are you?"
00:37:07.475,00:37:09.185,Eleven!
00:37:09.310,00:37:10.519,El?
00:37:20.321,00:37:22.740,"All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me."
00:37:22.823,00:37:24.617,-I need you to tilt his head back... -Okay.
00:37:24.700,00:37:26.619,-...and lift his chin. -Okay.
00:37:26.702,00:37:28.204,"One, two, three, four."
00:37:28.287,00:37:33.167,"Now when I tell you, you're gonna pinch his nostrils, and breathe into his mouth..."
00:37:33.251,00:37:35.169,-twice. -Okay.
00:37:35.253,00:37:36.295,One second...
00:37:36.379,00:37:37.880,then pause.
00:37:37.964,00:37:39.632,"22, 23."
00:37:39.715,00:37:40.758,-Then one second. -Okay.
00:37:40.841,00:37:42.843,"24, 25, 26, 27, 28..."
00:37:42.927,00:37:45.805,"29, 30. Now! Go!"
00:37:51.936,00:37:53.479,"Come on, kid."
00:37:53.562,00:37:54.689,"-Come on, kid! -Will!"
00:37:54.772,00:37:55.982,"Will, listen to me."
00:37:56.065,00:37:58.317,"It's me, it's your mom and I love you so much."
00:37:58.401,00:37:59.527,I love you so much.
00:37:59.610,00:38:02.822,I love you more than anything in the world.
00:38:08.869,00:38:10.371,Her pulse ox is falling.
00:38:11.580,00:38:14.166,I love you so much. I love you more than anything in the world.
00:38:17.086,00:38:19.255,"-Come on, kid! -Please, please wake up."
00:38:19.338,00:38:20.548,"Please, please."
00:38:31.350,00:38:32.685,I need you to breathe.
00:38:32.810,00:38:34.312,Please breathe!
00:38:36.022,00:38:37.148,Please!
00:38:45.281,00:38:47.116,"That's it, baby. Breathe."
00:38:47.199,00:38:49.327,Breathe. All right. Come on.
00:38:49.410,00:38:50.786,Come on.
00:38:50.870,00:38:52.955,"Breathe, breathe, come on, come on."
00:38:53.039,00:38:54.749,"Good, good, good, good."
00:39:32.912,00:39:34.121,Michael!
00:39:37.875,00:39:39.126,Michael?
00:39:45.424,00:39:46.884,"Oh, my God."
00:39:48.010,00:39:49.011,You're okay.
00:39:50.721,00:39:51.722,You're okay.
00:40:29.301,00:40:30.761,Hey.
00:40:43.441,00:40:44.483,You're safe.
00:40:44.567,00:40:46.193,Jonathan.
00:40:48.112,00:40:49.905,"Yeah, it's me, buddy."
00:40:54.743,00:40:56.704,We really missed you.
00:41:00.458,00:41:01.625,"What, this?"
00:41:02.626,00:41:04.837,It's just a cut. It's nothing.
00:41:06.797,00:41:08.757,You're worried about my hand.
00:41:16.223,00:41:18.434,We brought you some stuff...
00:41:19.477,00:41:21.103,so you don't get bored in here.
00:41:24.899,00:41:27.985,"Uh, I made you a new mix tape."
00:41:28.527,00:41:31.489,There's some stuff on there I think you really might like.
00:42:18.327,00:42:20.246,"Guys. Guys, he's up. Will is up. Guys, Will's up."
00:42:37.471,00:42:39.306,-Jennifer Hayes was crying. -And Troy peed himself.
00:42:39.390,00:42:41.058,-What? -In front of the whole school!
00:42:47.439,00:42:48.649,You okay?
00:42:49.692,00:42:50.734,It got me.
00:42:51.652,00:42:52.903,The Demogorgon.
00:42:52.987,00:42:54.446,We know.
00:42:54.530,00:42:55.531,It's okay.
00:42:55.614,00:42:56.991,It's dead.
00:42:57.074,00:42:58.200,We made a new friend.
00:42:58.284,00:43:01.245,She stopped it. She saved us.
00:43:02.079,00:43:03.205,But she's gone now.
00:43:04.832,00:43:06.875,-Her name's Eleven. -Like the number?
00:43:06.959,00:43:08.210,"Well, we call her El for short."
00:43:08.294,00:43:09.378,She's basically a wizard.
00:43:10.713,00:43:11.714,More like a Yoda.
00:43:13.424,00:43:16.677,"and these agents were trying to shoot us-- -Yeah, it flipped over us-- -Then she squeezed the brains out..."
00:44:52.189,00:44:53.440,Hungry for your blood.
00:44:53.524,00:44:55.359,It is almost here.
00:44:55.442,00:44:57.528,"-What is it? -It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you."
00:44:57.611,00:44:58.695,It's not the thessalhydra.
00:44:58.779,00:45:00.322,"I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra."
00:45:03.617,00:45:07.121,"-Will, your action! -What should I do? I-- Fireball him!"
00:45:10.082,00:45:11.291,Fireball the son of a bitch.
00:45:17.089,00:45:19.925,Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra.
00:45:22.094,00:45:25.055,and then... it crumbles to the ground.
00:45:25.139,00:45:30.185,"Its clawed hand reaches for you one last time and, and, and..."
00:45:30.269,00:45:31.687,and...
00:45:38.485,00:45:42.281,"Lucas cuts off its seven heads, and Dustin places them into his bag of holding."
00:45:42.364,00:45:46.243,"You carry the heads out of the dungeon, victorious, and you present them to King Tristan."
00:45:46.326,00:45:47.703,He thanks you for your bravery and service.
00:45:47.786,00:45:50.747,"Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not it, is it?"
00:45:50.831,00:45:54.376,"No, there's a medal ceremony-- Oh, a medal ceremony? What are you talking about?"
00:45:54.460,00:45:56.420,-And-- -The campaign was way too short.
00:45:56.503,00:45:58.046,-Yeah! -It was ten hours!
00:45:58.130,00:45:59.131,But it doesn't make any sense.
00:45:59.214,00:46:01.675,"-It makes sense. -Uh, no, what about the lost knight?"
00:46:01.758,00:46:03.218,And the proud princess?
00:46:03.302,00:46:04.636,And those weird flowers in the cave?
00:46:07.055,00:46:08.140,"Jeez, what's that smell?"
00:46:08.223,00:46:09.892,"Have you guys been playing games all day, or just farting?"
00:46:11.518,00:46:12.686,He farted.
00:46:44.301,00:46:45.636,"-So, you have fun? -Yeah."
00:46:46.845,00:46:47.846,"-Hey, Mrs. Wheeler. -Hi."
00:46:47.930,00:46:49.932,"Hey, wish your mom a merry Christmas for me, okay?"
00:46:50.015,00:46:51.850,"-Yeah. -Yeah, thank you. Uh, merry Christmas."
00:46:51.934,00:46:53.268,Merry Christmas.
00:46:54.353,00:46:55.938,"-So, uh, you win? -Yeah."
00:46:56.021,00:46:58.690,"-Awesome. -Hey, Jonathan, wait up."
00:47:03.153,00:47:04.905,-Uh... -Merry Christmas.
00:47:04.988,00:47:06.657,"Thanks, um..."
00:47:07.658,00:47:09.159,I... I didn't get you anything.
00:47:09.243,00:47:11.161,-I... I feel bad. -No.
00:47:11.245,00:47:15.165,"No, it's, uh, it's not really a present."
00:47:16.166,00:47:19.378,"It's, um... Well, you'll see."
00:47:27.386,00:47:29.054,Merry Christmas.
00:47:43.652,00:47:44.653,Can I open it?
00:47:45.821,00:47:47.197,"Yeah, sure."
00:47:50.117,00:47:51.285,Whoa.
00:47:51.368,00:47:52.369,Pretty cool.
00:47:54.663,00:47:55.747,Yeah.
00:48:13.974,00:48:15.267,Did you give it to him?
00:48:16.184,00:48:17.394,Yeah.
00:48:47.591,00:48:48.967,"You leaving already, Chief?"
00:48:49.051,00:48:52.346,"Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted to come to this thing? I was just hungry."
00:48:52.429,00:48:53.764,"Oh, yeah, that's the spirit."
00:48:53.847,00:48:56.850,"Well, your wife doesn't have time to cook for me, you know what I'm saying?"
00:48:59.519,00:49:00.687,"Merry Christmas, Hop."
00:50:13.885,00:50:14.928,That one of yours?
00:50:19.891,00:50:21.685,Be careful. You'll break it.
00:50:27.065,00:50:28.900,What are you... What are you doing?
00:50:30.485,00:50:31.862,"Oh, why?"
00:50:33.405,00:50:36.575,"-It looks great. -Oh, this is just so overcooked."
00:50:36.658,00:50:39.202,"-And look, the potatoes are runny. -Mom."
00:50:42.706,00:50:45.208,-It's definitely an Atari. -An a-what-i?
00:50:45.292,00:50:46.585,The green present. It's an Atari.
00:50:46.668,00:50:49.296,"I felt Dustin's today, it's the same exact weight."
00:50:52.340,00:50:54.009,"We'll have to see, won't we?"
00:50:56.553,00:50:57.637,"Hey, no more snooping."
00:50:57.721,00:50:59.890,"No, I forgot to wash my hands. I'll be right back."
00:50:59.973,00:51:01.183,Okay.
00:51:49.648,00:51:50.732,Are you okay?
00:51:51.900,00:51:53.652,"Yeah, I'm okay."
00:51:56.613,00:51:59.658,"Mmm. Hey, Mom. Did Will tell you about, uh, the game?"
00:51:59.741,00:52:00.909,"-Oh, yeah. -No. What game?"
