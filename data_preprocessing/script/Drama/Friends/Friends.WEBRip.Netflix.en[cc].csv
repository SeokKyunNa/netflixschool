00:00:47.673,00:00:49.048,THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.
00:00:49.048,00:00:50.759,IT'S JUST SOME GUY I WORK WITH.
00:00:50.759,00:00:52.887,COME ON.
00:00:52.887,00:00:54.805,THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.
00:00:55.890,00:00:56.932,"SO, DOES HE HAVE A HUMP?"
00:00:56.932,00:00:57.975,A HUMP AND A HAIRPIECE?
00:01:00.227,00:01:02.897,"WAIT, DOES HE EAT CHALK?"
00:01:02.897,00:01:06.274,JUST 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT HER TO GO THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH WITH CARL.
00:01:06.274,00:01:09.319,"OKAY, EVERYBODY RELAX."
00:01:09.319,00:01:12.489,IT'S TWO PEOPLE GOING OUT TO DINNER AND NOT HAVING SEX.
00:01:12.489,00:01:14.157,SOUNDS LIKE A DATE TO ME.
00:01:16.911,00:01:18.412,SO I'M BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.
00:01:18.412,00:01:23.458,I'M STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAFETERIA AND I REALIZE I AM TOTALLY... NAKED.
00:01:23.458,00:01:25.252,I'VE HAD THAT DREAM.

00:01:30.049,00:01:31.050,THERE.

00:01:34.970,00:01:36.304,NEVER HAD THAT DREAM.
00:01:36.304,00:01:47.399,"ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE PHONE STARTS TO RING AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S MY MOTHER WHICH IS VERY, VERY WEIRD BECAUSE..."
00:01:47.399,00:01:48.859,SHE NEVER CALLS ME.
00:01:52.988,00:01:54.531,HI.
00:01:56.157,00:01:57.952,THIS GUY SAYS HELLO.
00:01:57.952,00:01:59.995,I WANT TO KILL MYSELF.
00:01:59.995,00:02:01.496,"ARE YOU OKAY, SWEETIE?"
00:02:01.496,00:02:08.003,"I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE REACHED DOWN MY THROAT GRABBED MY SMALL INTESTINE, PULLED IT OUT MY MOUTH AND TIED IT AROUND MY NECK."
00:02:08.003,00:02:09.088,COOKIE?
00:02:10.798,00:02:12.967,CAROL MOVED HER STUFF OUT TODAY.

00:02:22.142,00:02:24.686,STOP CLEANSING MY AURA.
00:02:24.686,00:02:29.149,"NO, JUST LEAVE MY AURA ALONE, OKAY?"
00:02:29.149,00:02:31.026,"I'LL BE FINE, ALL RIGHT?"
00:02:31.026,00:02:32.152,I HOPE SHE'LL BE VERY HAPPY.
00:02:32.152,00:02:33.278,"Monica: NO, YOU DON'T."
00:02:33.278,00:02:34.696,NO I DON'T.
00:02:34.696,00:02:37.240,SHE LEFT ME.
00:02:37.240,00:02:39.076,AND YOU NEVER KNEW SHE WAS A LESBIAN?
00:02:43.163,00:02:44.832,NO. OKAY?
00:02:44.832,00:02:48.293,WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP FIXATING ON THAT?
00:02:49.795,00:02:53.465,SHE DIDN'T KNOW.
00:02:53.465,00:02:56.593,SOMETIMES I WISH I WAS A LESBIAN.
00:02:58.470,00:03:00.848,DID I SAY THAT OUT LOUD?
00:03:02.432,00:03:06.520,"ALL RIGHT, ROSS, LOOK YOU'RE FEELING A LOT OF PAIN RIGHT NOW."
00:03:06.520,00:03:09.731,YOU'RE ANGRY. YOU'RE HURTING.
00:03:09.731,00:03:10.816,CAN I TELL YOU WHAT THE ANSWER IS?
00:03:12.067,00:03:13.401,STRIP JOINTS!

00:03:20.325,00:03:23.286,"I JUST, I JUST, I JUST WANT TO BE MARRIED AGAIN."
00:03:27.791,00:03:30.209,AND I JUST WANT A MILLION DOLLARS.
00:03:31.503,00:03:32.713,RACHEL?
00:03:32.713,00:03:36.091,"OH, GOD, MONICA, HI."
00:03:36.091,00:03:42.014,"I JUST WENT TO YOUR BUILDING AND YOU WEREN'T THERE AND THEN THIS GUY WITH A BIG HAMMER SAID THAT YOU MIGHT BE HERE, AND YOU ARE."
00:03:42.014,00:03:43.515,CAN I GET YOU SOME COFFEE?
00:03:43.515,00:03:44.892,DECAF.
00:03:46.143,00:03:50.313,"OKAY, EVERYBODY, THIS IS RACHEL ANOTHER LINCOLN HIGH SURVIVOR."
00:03:50.313,00:03:51.565,THIS IS EVERYBODY.
00:03:50.313,00:03:55.235,"THIS IS CHANDLER AND PHOEBE, AND JOEY AND YOU REMEMBER MY BROTHER ROSS?"
00:03:55.235,00:03:56.653,SURE.
00:03:56.653,00:03:57.988,HI. OH!
00:04:06.454,00:04:10.209,"SO, YOU WANT TO TELL US NOW OR ARE WE WAITING FOR FOUR WET BRIDESMAIDS?"
00:04:10.209,00:04:14.963,"OH, GOD."
00:04:10.209,00:04:16.715,"WELL, IT STARTED ABOUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE THE WEDDING."
00:04:16.715,00:04:26.516,I WAS IN THIS ROOM WHERE WE WERE KEEPING ALL THE PRESENTS AND I WAS LOOKING AT THIS GRAVY BOAT-- THIS REALLY GORGEOUS LIMOGES GRAVY BOAT-- WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN...
00:04:26.516,00:04:27.684,SWEET AND LOW?
00:04:27.684,00:04:38.820,I REALIZED THAT I WAS MORE TURNED ON BY THIS GRAVY BOAT THAN BY BARRY AND THEN I GOT REALLY FREAKED OUT AND THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME HOW MUCH BARRY LOOKS LIKE MR. POTATO HEAD.
00:04:40.363,00:04:42.908,"I MEAN, I ALWAYS KNEW HE LOOKED FAMILIAR, BUT..."
00:04:45.869,00:04:53.334,"ANYWAY, I JUST HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE AND I STARTED WONDERING, WHY AM I DOING THIS AND WHO AM I DOING THIS FOR?"
00:04:53.334,00:05:00.717,"SO, ANYWAY, I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO AND I KNOW THAT YOU AND I HAVE DRIFTED APART BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON I KNEW WHO LIVED IN THE CITY."
00:05:00.717,00:05:02.677,WHO WASN'T INVITED TO THE WEDDING.
00:05:02.677,00:05:05.513,"OH, I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE."
00:05:13.230,00:05:19.236,"...Elijarme la mano, aquellos criminales."
00:05:19.236,00:05:26.243,"Monica: NOW, I'M GUESSING THAT HE BOUGHT HER THE BIG PIPE ORGAN AND SHE'S REALLY NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT."
00:05:26.243,00:05:27.828,"DADDY, I JUST..."
00:05:27.828,00:05:29.537,I CAN'T MARRY HIM.
00:05:29.537,00:05:30.872,I'M SORRY.
00:05:30.872,00:05:33.708,I JUST DON'T LOVE HIM.
00:05:33.708,00:05:36.711,"WELL, IT MATTERS TO ME."
00:05:39.422,00:05:42.425,Chandler: SHE SHOULD NOT BE WEARING THOSE PANTS.
00:05:42.425,00:05:45.595,I SAY PUSH HER DOWN THE STAIRS.
00:05:45.595,00:05:47.597,All: PUSH HER DOWN THE STAIRS!
00:05:47.597,00:05:50.433,PUSH HER DOWN THE STAIRS!
00:05:50.433,00:05:51.977,ALL RIGHT!
00:05:51.977,00:05:55.314,"COME ON, DADDY, LISTEN TO ME."
00:05:55.314,00:05:59.234,"ALL OF MY LIFE EVERYONE HAS ALWAYS TOLD ME, YOU'RE A SHOE."
00:05:59.234,00:06:00.568,YOU'RE A SHOE.
00:06:00.568,00:06:02.279,YOU'RE A SHOE.
00:06:02.279,00:06:05.615,AND THEN TODAY I JUST STOPPED AND SAID WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO BE A SHOE?
00:06:05.615,00:06:07.784,WHAT IF I WANT TO BE A PURSE?
00:06:07.784,00:06:11.955,OR A HAT?
00:06:11.955,00:06:13.456,"NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO BUY ME A HAT."
00:06:13.456,00:06:14.749,I'M SAYING THAT I AM A HAT...
00:06:14.749,00:06:16.543,"IT'S A METAPHOR, DADDY!"
00:06:18.170,00:06:20.339,YOU CAN SEE WHERE HE'D HAVE TROUBLE.
00:06:23.382,00:06:26.803,"LOOK, DADDY, IT'S MY LIFE."
00:06:26.803,00:06:29.264,"WELL, MAYBE I'LL JUST STAY HERE WITH MONICA."
00:06:32.559,00:06:34.769,"WELL, I GUESS WE'VE ESTABLISHED SHE'S STAYING HERE WITH MONICA."
00:06:36.355,00:06:39.941,"WELL, MAYBE THAT'S MY DECISION."
00:06:39.941,00:06:42.069,"WELL, MAYBE I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY."
00:06:42.069,00:06:44.238,"WAIT, WAIT! I SAID MAYBE!"
00:06:51.245,00:06:54.164,"OKAY, JUST BREATHE."
00:06:54.164,00:06:56.833,"JUST TRY TO THINK OF NICE, CALM THINGS."
00:07:09.346,00:07:10.555,I'M ALL BETTER NOW.
00:07:13.183,00:07:14.351,I HELPED.
00:07:16.770,00:07:19.231,"OKAY, LOOK, THIS IS PROBABLY FOR THE BEST."
00:07:19.231,00:07:20.357,INDEPENDENCE...
00:07:20.357,00:07:22.150,TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE.
00:07:22.150,00:07:26.363,"AND HEY, YOU NEED ANYTHING YOU CAN ALWAYS COME TO JOEY."
00:07:26.363,00:07:31.659,ME AND CHANDLER LIVE RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL AND HE'S AWAY A LOT.
00:07:31.659,00:07:33.120,STOP HITTING ON HER.
00:07:33.120,00:07:34.704,IT'S HER WEDDING DAY.
00:07:34.704,00:07:36.831,LIKE THERE'S A RULE OR SOMETHING?
00:07:38.666,00:07:40.877,PLEASE DON'T DO THAT AGAIN.
00:07:40.877,00:07:42.796,IT'S A HORRIBLE SOUND.
00:07:42.796,00:07:44.339,"Uh, it's-- it's Paul."
00:07:44.339,00:07:45.340,BUZZ HIM IN.
00:07:45.340,00:07:46.466,WHO'S PAUL?
00:07:46.466,00:07:48.260,PAUL THE WINE GUY PAUL?
00:07:48.260,00:07:49.344,MAYBE.
00:07:49.344,00:07:52.847,YOUR NOT A REAL DATE TONIGHT IS WITH PAUL THE WINE GUY?
00:07:52.847,00:07:54.391,HE FINALLY ASKED YOU OUT?
00:07:54.391,00:07:55.516,YES.
00:07:55.516,00:07:56.810,A DEAR DIARY MOMENT.
00:07:56.810,00:07:59.896,"RACH, WAIT."
00:07:59.896,00:08:01.898,"PLEASE, NO, GO. I'LL BE FINE."
00:08:01.898,00:08:03.691,"ROSS, ARE YOU OKAY?"
00:08:03.691,00:08:06.527,"I MEAN, DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY?"
00:08:06.527,00:08:08.363,THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
00:08:08.363,00:08:09.572,REALLY?
00:08:09.572,00:08:10.824,NO! GO ON!
00:08:10.824,00:08:12.867,IT'S PAUL THE WINE GUY!
00:08:16.371,00:08:17.747,HI. COME IN.
00:08:17.747,00:08:19.166,"PAUL, THIS IS..."
00:08:19.166,00:08:20.541,EVERYBODY.
00:08:20.541,00:08:22.543,"EVERYBODY, THIS IS PAUL."
00:08:22.543,00:08:24.045,All: PAUL THE WINE GUY!
00:08:24.045,00:08:26.214,I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME.
00:08:26.214,00:08:28.091,"PAUL, WAS IT?"
00:08:28.091,00:08:29.426,SIT DOWN.
00:08:29.426,00:08:31.011,TWO SECONDS.
00:08:34.973,00:08:36.891,I JUST PULLED OUT FOUR EYELASHES.
00:08:36.891,00:08:38.268,THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.
00:08:40.061,00:08:42.730,"SO, RACHEL, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO TONIGHT?"
00:08:42.730,00:08:47.027,I WAS KIND OF SUPPOSED TO BE HEADED FOR ARUBA ON MY HONEYMOON.
00:08:47.027,00:08:48.195,"SO, NOTHING."
00:08:49.946,00:08:52.907,RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT EVEN GETTING YOUR HONEYMOON.
00:08:52.907,00:08:53.992,GOD...
00:08:53.992,00:08:55.743,NO... ARUBA.
00:08:55.743,00:08:59.622,"THIS TIME OF YEAR, TALK ABOUT YOUR..."
00:08:59.622,00:09:01.082,BIG LIZARDS.
00:09:05.837,00:09:12.760,"ANYWAY, IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE BEING ALONE TONIGHT JOEY AND CHANDLER ARE HELPING ME PUT TOGETHER MY NEW FURNITURE."
00:09:12.760,00:09:15.096,AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT.
00:09:15.096,00:09:18.933,"THANKS, BUT I'M GOING TO HANG OUT HERE TONIGHT."
00:09:18.933,00:09:19.934,IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.
00:09:19.934,00:09:21.228,"OH, SURE. OKAY, SURE."
00:09:21.228,00:09:23.146,"PHEEBS, YOU WANT TO HELP?"
00:09:23.146,00:09:24.605,"I WISH I COULD, BUT I DON'T WANT TO."
00:09:32.113,00:09:40.288,I'M SUPPOSED TO ATTACH A BRACKETY THING TO THE SIDE THINGS USING A BUNCH OF THESE LITTLE WORM GUYS.
00:09:41.498,00:09:43.458,I HAVE NO BRACKETY THING.
00:09:43.458,00:09:45.960,I SEE NO WORM GUYS WHATSOEVER.
00:09:45.960,00:09:50.298,AND I CANNOT FEEL MY LEGS.
00:09:50.298,00:09:52.092,WHAT'S THIS?
00:09:52.092,00:09:55.220,I HAVE NO IDEA.
00:09:56.721,00:09:58.223,DONE WITH THE BOOKCASE!
00:09:58.223,00:09:59.516,ALL FINISHED!
00:10:02.894,00:10:04.896,THIS WAS CAROL'S FAVORITE BEER.
00:10:06.606,00:10:08.649,SHE ALWAYS DRANK IT OUT OF THE CAN.
00:10:08.649,00:10:11.278,I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
00:10:11.278,00:10:12.820,"ROSS, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION."
00:10:12.820,00:10:17.284,"SHE GOT THE FURNITURE, THE STEREO, THE GOOD TV."
00:10:17.284,00:10:18.910,WHAT DID YOU GET?
00:10:18.910,00:10:20.078,YOU GUYS.
00:10:20.078,00:10:22.372,YOU GOT SCREWED.
00:10:22.372,00:10:23.582,"OH, MY GOD."
00:10:23.582,00:10:27.210,I KNOW.
00:10:27.210,00:10:32.006,I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT ON WHEN SHE STARTED GOING TO THE DENTIST FOUR AND FIVE TIMES A WEEK.
00:10:32.006,00:10:34.384,"I MEAN, HOW CLEAN CAN TEETH GET?"
00:10:34.384,00:10:35.843,MY BROTHER'S GOING THROUGH THAT NOW.
00:10:35.843,00:10:36.928,HE'S SUCH A MESS.
00:10:36.928,00:10:38.221,HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH IT?
00:10:38.221,00:10:43.143,"HE MIGHT TRY ACCIDENTALLY BREAKING SOMETHING VALUABLE OF HERS-- SAY, HER..."
00:10:43.143,00:10:44.561,LEG?
00:10:44.561,00:10:46.229,THAT'S ONE WAY OF GOING THROUGH IT.
00:10:46.229,00:10:48.315,"ME, I WENT FOR THE WATCH."
00:10:48.315,00:10:50.691,YOU ACTUALLY BROKE HER WATCH?
00:10:50.691,00:10:54.028,"BARRY, I'M SORRY."
00:10:54.028,00:10:59.784,I KNOW YOU PROBABLY THINK THIS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT I SAID THE OTHER NIGHT ABOUT YOU MAKING LOVE WITH YOUR SOCKS ON BUT IT ISN'T.
00:10:59.784,00:11:01.369,IT ISN'T-- IT'S ABOUT ME.
00:11:01.369,00:11:02.579,AND I DID...
00:11:09.043,00:11:11.087,HI. MACHINE CUT ME OFF AGAIN.
00:11:11.087,00:11:13.672,ANYWAY...
00:11:13.672,00:11:15.758,YOU KNOW WHAT THE SCARIEST PART IS?
00:11:15.758,00:11:18.595,WHAT IF THERE'S ONLY ONE WOMAN FOR EVERYBODY?
00:11:18.595,00:11:22.056,WHAT IF YOU GET ONE WOMAN AND THAT'S IT?
00:11:22.056,00:11:27.145,"UNFORTUNATELY, IN MY CASE THERE WAS ONLY ONE WOMAN FOR HER."
00:11:27.145,00:11:29.606,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
00:11:29.606,00:11:30.607,ONE WOMAN.
00:11:30.607,00:11:35.028,THAT'S LIKE SAYING THERE'S ONLY ONE FLAVOR OF ICE CREAM FOR YOU.
00:11:35.028,00:11:36.446,"LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, ROSS."
00:11:36.446,00:11:39.533,THERE'S LOT OF FLAVORS OUT THERE.
00:11:39.533,00:11:43.620,THERE'S ROCKY ROAD AND COOKIE DOUGH AND BING CHERRY VANILLA.
00:11:43.620,00:11:48.916,YOU CAN GET THEM WITH JIMMIES OR NUTS OR WHIPPED CREAM.
00:11:48.916,00:11:51.461,THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.

00:11:59.718,00:12:03.390,I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW IF I'M HUNGRY OR HORNY.
00:12:03.390,00:12:05.225,THEN STAY OUT OF MY FREEZER.
00:12:08.895,00:12:12.440,"EVER SINCE SHE WALKED OUT ON ME, I..."
00:12:12.440,00:12:13.774,WHAT?
00:12:13.774,00:12:16.695,"WHAT, YOU WANT TO SPELL IT OUT WITH NOODLES?"
00:12:16.695,00:12:20.490,"NO, IT'S MORE OF A FIFTH DATE KIND OF REVELATION."

00:12:50.853,00:12:52.272,IT'S OKAY.
00:12:52.272,00:12:56.526,BEING SPIT ON IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU NEED RIGHT NOW.
00:12:56.526,00:12:57.902,UM... OOH.

00:13:24.887,00:13:29.183,"SEE, BUT JOANIE LOVED CHACHI."
00:13:29.183,00:13:31.018,THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
00:13:33.062,00:13:34.897,GRAB A SPOON.
00:13:34.897,00:13:37.692,DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN SINCE I GRABBED A SPOON?
00:13:37.692,00:13:40.945,"DO THE WORDS BILLY, DON'T BE A HERO MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?"
00:13:43.281,00:13:45.283,"YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE THING."
00:13:45.283,00:13:52.540,EVEN IF I COULD GET IT TOGETHER ENOUGH TO ASK A WOMAN OUT WHO AM I GOING TO ASK?

00:15:07.699,00:15:10.243,THAT WASN'T A REAL DATE.
00:15:10.243,00:15:14.247,WHAT THE HELL DO YOU DO ON A REAL DATE?
00:15:14.247,00:15:16.916,SHUT UP AND PUT MY TABLE BACK.

00:15:23.214,00:15:28.595,IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.
00:15:28.595,00:15:31.472,"SO, LIKE, YOU GUYS ALL HAVE JOBS?"
00:15:31.472,00:15:34.016,"YEAH, WE ALL HAVE JOBS."

00:17:29.173,00:17:31.926,OF COURSE IT WAS A LINE.
00:17:31.926,00:17:35.013,WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?!
00:17:35.013,00:17:39.559,I ASSUME WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN TO GET YOU INTO BED.
00:17:41.477,00:17:43.103,IS IT ME?!
00:17:43.103,00:17:49.610,IS IT LIKE I HAVE SOME SORT OF BEACON THAT ONLY DOGS AND MEN WITH SEVERE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS CAN HEAR?
00:17:49.610,00:17:51.654,GIVE ME YOUR FEET.
00:17:59.078,00:18:00.997,"I JUST THOUGHT HE WAS NICE, YOU KNOW?"
00:18:03.708,00:18:06.335,I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A LINE.

00:18:19.974,00:18:21.726,YET YOU'RE UPBEAT.
00:18:21.726,00:18:27.398,"YOU WOULD BE, TOO, IF YOU FOUND JOAN AND DAVID BOOTS ON SALE 50 PERCENT OFF."

00:18:53.257,00:18:56.094,IT'S HARD BEING ON YOUR OWN THE FIRST TIME.
00:18:56.094,00:18:57.887,THANK YOU.
00:18:57.887,00:18:59.221,I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE.
00:18:59.221,00:19:03.768,"I WAS 14, MY MOM HAD JUST KILLED HERSELF AND MY STEPDAD WAS BACK IN PRISON."
00:19:03.768,00:19:05.895,I GOT HERE AND DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY.
00:19:05.895,00:19:16.030,I ENDED UP LIVING WITH THIS ALBINO GUY WHO WAS CLEANING WINDSHIELDS OUTSIDE PORT AUTHORITY AND THEN HE KILLED HIMSELF AND THEN I FOUND AROMA THERAPY.
00:19:16.030,00:19:18.198,SO I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL.

00:00:20.855,00:00:25.024,IT'S LIKE THE STAND-UP COMEDIAN YOU HAVE TO SIT THROUGH BEFORE PINK FLOYD COMES IN.
00:00:28.445,00:00:32.073,"YEAH, AND IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T LIKE THE COMEDIAN."

00:00:47.255,00:00:49.132,"I MEAN WE'RE IN THE CAR, FIGHTING TRAFFIC."
00:00:49.174,00:00:54.137,"BASICALLY, JUST TRYING TO STAY AWAKE."

00:00:57.349,00:01:01.562,"OTHERWISE, NEXT TIME YOU'RE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF SITTING AT HOME LISTENING TO THAT ALBUM ALONE."
00:01:06.650,00:01:08.485,ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT SEX?
00:02:03.082,00:02:04.332,"Ross: NO, IT'S GOOD."
00:02:04.374,00:02:05.333,IT IS GOOD.
00:02:05.375,00:02:06.752,"IT'S JUST THAT, HMM..."
00:02:06.794,00:02:09.671,DOESN'T SHE SEEM A LITTLE ANGRY?
00:02:09.713,00:02:12.883,"WELL, SHE HAS ISSUES."

00:03:33.254,00:03:35.340,MARTY'S STILL TOTALLY PARANOID.
00:03:35.382,00:03:36.550,"OH, AND THAT'S..."
00:03:36.591,00:03:39.928,"CAROL, WHY ARE YOU HERE, CAROL?"
00:03:39.970,00:03:41.346,I'M PREGNANT.
00:03:41.388,00:03:43.057,PREGNANT.
00:03:49.604,00:03:54.234,Ha! It looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all.
00:03:54.275,00:04:01.075,I THINK THIS IS THE EPISODE OF THREE'S COMPANY WHERE THERE'S SOME KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING.
00:04:01.116,00:04:04.870,"OH, THEN I'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS ONE."
00:04:04.912,00:04:07.748,ARE YOU THROUGH WITH THAT?
00:04:07.789,00:04:10.625,"YEAH, SORRY."
00:04:10.667,00:04:13.170,WHOSE LITTLE BALL OF PAPER IS THIS?
00:04:13.212,00:04:14.713,"OH, THAT WOULD BE MINE."
00:04:14.755,00:04:19.593,"SEE, I WROTE A NOTE TO MYSELF THEN I REALIZED I DIDN'T NEED IT, SO I BALLED IT UP..."
00:04:19.634,00:04:22.137,AND NOW I WISH I WAS DEAD.
00:04:22.179,00:04:24.223,SHE ALREADY FLUFFED THAT PILLOW.
00:04:24.264,00:04:25.766,"MONICA, YOU ALREADY..."
00:04:25.807,00:04:27.726,BUT IT'S FINE.
00:04:27.768,00:04:31.897,I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM ANY MORE AMMUNITION THAN THEY ALREADY HAVE.
00:04:31.939,00:04:37.236,"YES, AND WE ALL KNOW HOW CRUEL A PARENT CAN BE ABOUT THE FLATNESS OF A CHILD'S PILLOW."
00:04:37.277,00:04:38.904,MONICA? HI.
00:04:38.946,00:04:41.489,"UM, MONICA?"

00:04:44.534,00:04:48.080,"I MEAN, YOU'RE LIKE ALL CHAOTIC AND TWIRLY, YOU KNOW?"
00:04:48.122,00:04:49.664,AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.
00:04:49.706,00:04:52.918,"YEAH, CALM DOWN."
00:04:52.960,00:04:57.589,YOU DON'T SEE ROSS GETTING ALL CHAOTIC AND TWIRLY EVERY TIME THEY COME.
00:04:57.631,00:05:02.094,THAT'S BECAUSE AS FAR AS MY PARENTS ARE CONCERNED ROSS CAN DO NO WRONG.
00:05:02.136,00:05:03.929,"YOU SEE, HE'S A PRINCE."
00:05:03.971,00:05:08.100,"APPARENTLY, THEY HAD SOME BIG CEREMONY BEFORE I WAS BORN."
00:05:08.142,00:05:09.559,"EW, EW, EW, EW, EW!"
00:05:09.601,00:05:11.352,WHAT?

00:05:26.994,00:05:28.411,"OH, GOD. OH, GOD."
00:05:28.453,00:05:30.580,"OH, GOD. OH, GOD. OH, GOD."
00:05:30.622,00:05:31.999,"NO, DON'T TOUCH THAT."
00:05:33.333,00:05:36.795,"OH, LIKE I WASN'T DREADING TOMORROW ENOUGH."
00:05:36.837,00:05:38.755,HAVING TO GIVE IT BACK TO HIM.
00:05:38.797,00:05:41.133,"HI, BARRY. REMEMBER ME?"
00:05:38.797,00:05:44.136,I'M THE GIRL IN THE VEIL THAT STOMPED ON YOUR HEART IN FRONT OF YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.
00:05:44.178,00:05:50.684,NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RETURN THE RING WITHOUT THE RING WHICH MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER.
00:05:50.725,00:05:52.602,"EASY, RACH."

00:05:59.693,00:06:02.196,DOY. PROBABLY RIGHT BEFORE SHE LOST IT.
00:06:03.697,00:06:06.700,YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF DOY THESE DAYS.
00:06:08.702,00:06:14.916,"NO, I HAD IT THIS MORNING AND I KNOW I HAD IT WHEN I WAS IN THE KITCHEN WITH..."
00:06:14.958,00:06:17.127,DINAH?
00:06:19.129,00:06:22.049,"OH, DON'T BE MAD."

00:06:23.466,00:06:25.177,"OH, I'M SORRY."
00:06:25.219,00:06:27.346,I GAVE YOU ONE JOB.
00:06:27.386,00:06:30.515,"OH, BUT LOOK HOW STRAIGHT THOSE NOODLES ARE."
00:06:30.557,00:06:37.231,"Chandler: MONICA, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT HOW YOU LOOK FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING IN A LASAGNA."
00:06:37.272,00:06:40.608,I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
00:06:40.650,00:06:43.570,BOYS?

00:07:21.566,00:07:23.902,HOW DO YOU FIT INTO THIS WHOLE THING?
00:07:23.944,00:07:31.410,"WELL, CAROL SAYS SHE AND SUSAN WANT ME TO BE INVOLVED BUT IF I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT I DON'T HAVE TO BE INVOLVED."
00:07:31.451,00:07:33.620,"BASICALLY, IT'S TOTALLY UP TO ME."
00:07:33.661,00:07:34.829,SHE IS SO GREAT.
00:07:34.871,00:07:35.997,I MISS HER.
00:07:40.168,00:07:42.629,"WELL, WHAT DOES SHE MEAN BY INVOLVED?"
00:07:42.670,00:07:46.591,"PRESUMABLY, THE BIGGEST PART OF YOUR JOB IS DONE."
00:07:46.633,00:07:52.931,ANYWAY THEY WANT ME TO GO DOWN TO THIS SONOGRAM THING WITH THEM TOMORROW.
00:07:52.973,00:07:54.141,WHAT WILL YOU DO?
00:07:54.182,00:07:55.642,I HAVE NO IDEA.
00:07:55.683,00:07:59.729,"NO MATTER WHAT I DO, THOUGH I'M STILL GOING TO BE A FATHER."
00:08:10.157,00:08:11.992,"THIS IS STILL RUINED, RIGHT?"
00:08:17.580,00:08:22.043,"OH, MARTHA LUDWIN'S DAUGHTER IS GOING TO CALL YOU."
00:08:22.085,00:08:26.465,"HMM, WHAT'S THAT CURRY TASTE?"
00:08:26.506,00:08:28.175,CURRY.

00:08:34.722,00:08:36.266,YOU REMEMBER THE LUDWINS.
00:08:36.308,00:08:38.893,"THE BIG ONE HAD A THING FOR YOU, DIDN'T SHE?"
00:08:38.935,00:08:40.854,THEY ALL HAD A THING FOR HIM.
00:08:40.895,00:08:41.855,"OH, MOM."
00:08:41.896,00:08:45.108,Monica: I'M SORRY. WHY IS THIS GIRL GOING TO CALL ME?
00:08:45.150,00:08:50.530,"SHE JUST GRADUATED, AND SHE WANTS TO BE SOMETHING IN COOKING OR FOOD OR..."
00:08:50.571,00:08:52.532,I TOLD HER YOU HAVE A RESTAURANT...
00:08:52.573,00:08:55.076,"NO, MOM. I DON'T HAVE A RESTAURANT."
00:08:55.118,00:08:56.619,I WORK IN A RESTAURANT.
00:08:56.661,00:08:58.663,"WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE TO KNOW THAT."
00:09:02.709,00:09:05.212,"ROSS, COULD YOU COME AND HELP ME WITH THE SPAGHETTI, PLEASE?"
00:09:05.253,00:09:06.380,YES.
00:09:06.421,00:09:07.839,"OH, WE'RE HAVING SPAGHETTI."
00:09:07.881,00:09:09.299,THAT'S... EASY.
00:09:12.344,00:09:18.892,I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND UNBELIEVABLY SELFISH ON MY PART BUT WERE YOU PLANNING ON BRINGING UP THE WHOLE BABY-LESBIAN THING?
00:09:18.933,00:09:21.853,'CAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT TAKE SOME OF THE HEAT OFF ME.
00:09:25.148,00:09:27.234,WHAT THAT RACHEL DID TO HER LIFE.
00:09:27.275,00:09:28.943,WE RAN INTO HER PARENTS AT THE CLUB.
00:09:28.985,00:09:31.112,THEY WEREN'T PLAYING WELL.
00:09:31.154,00:09:36.117,"I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY SPENT ON THAT WEDDING BUT $40,000 IS A LOT OF MONEY."
00:09:38.912,00:09:45.460,"WELL, AT LEAST SHE HAD THE CHANCE TO LEAVE A MAN AT THE ALTAR."
00:09:45.502,00:09:47.170,WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
00:09:47.212,00:09:48.922,NOTHING.
00:09:48.963,00:09:50.549,IT'S AN EXPRESSION.
00:09:50.590,00:09:52.217,"NO, IT'S NOT."
00:09:52.259,00:09:53.510,DON'T LISTEN TO HER.
00:09:53.552,00:09:55.720,YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN INDEPENDENT.
00:09:55.762,00:10:02.852,"EVEN WHEN YOU WERE A KID AND WERE CHUBBY, AND HAD NO FRIENDS YOU WERE JUST FINE."
00:10:02.894,00:10:06.314,AND YOU WOULD READ ALONE IN YOUR ROOM-- AND YOUR PUZZLES.
00:10:09.526,00:10:16.908,"LOOK, THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE ROSS WHO NEED TO SHOOT FOR THE STARS WITH HIS MUSEUM AND HIS PAPERS GETTING PUBLISHED."
00:10:16.950,00:10:19.953,OTHER PEOPLE ARE SATISFIED WITH STAYING WHERE THEY ARE.
00:10:19.994,00:10:24.332,"I'M TELLING YOU, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER GET CANCER."
00:10:25.833,00:10:33.508,I READ ABOUT THESE WOMEN TRYING TO HAVE IT ALL AND I THANK GOD OUR LITTLE HARMONICA DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THAT PROBLEM.
00:10:35.510,00:10:38.930,"SO, ROSS, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?"
00:10:38.972,00:10:40.265,ANY STORIES?
00:10:40.307,00:10:43.977,"NO NEWS, NO LITTLE ANECDOTES TO SHARE WITH THE FOLKS?"
00:10:44.018,00:10:45.353,"OKAY, OKAY."
00:10:47.188,00:10:55.655,"LOOK, I REALIZE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED BETWEEN CAROL AND ME, AND SO, WELL..."
00:10:55.696,00:10:56.906,HERE'S THE DEAL.
00:10:59.534,00:11:01.453,CAROL'S A LESBIAN.
00:11:03.538,00:11:05.957,SHE IS LIVING WITH A WOMAN NAMED SUSAN.
00:11:07.708,00:11:14.549,SHE'S PREGNANT WITH MY CHILD AND SHE AND SUSAN ARE GOING TO RAISE THE BABY.
00:11:17.760,00:11:20.221,AND YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?
00:11:34.777,00:11:36.655,"FOLKS ARE REALLY THAT BAD, HUH?"
00:11:36.695,00:11:40.367,"WELL, YOU KNOW, THESE PEOPLE ARE PROS."
00:11:41.535,00:11:43.744,THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
00:11:43.786,00:11:45.664,THEY TAKE THEIR TIME.
00:11:45.704,00:11:48.082,THEY GET THE JOB DONE.
00:11:49.708,00:11:53.254,I KNOW THEY SAY THAT YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR PARENTS.
00:11:53.296,00:11:56.383,"BOY, IF YOU COULD I'D WANT YOURS."
00:11:58.134,00:11:59.177,MUST PEE.
00:12:00.554,00:12:02.763,IT'S EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU'RE TWINS.

00:12:18.779,00:12:24.244,"WELL, NO, ALTHOUGH I DID HAVE AN IMAGINARY FRIEND WHO MY PARENTS ACTUALLY PREFERRED."
00:12:26.538,00:12:28.915,"Rachel: HIT THE LIGHTS, PLEASE."
00:12:35.296,00:12:36.923,HOW LONG WAS I IN THERE?

00:17:21.207,00:17:23.292,I BELIEVE JULIA'S ON THE TABLE.
00:17:24.961,00:17:25.920,OH.

00:18:09.422,00:18:11.340,"YEAH, WE'RE UH..."

00:18:38.868,00:18:43.831,"A MONTH AGO, I WANTED TO HURT YOU-- MORE THAN I'VE EVER WANTED TO HURT ANYONE."
00:18:43.873,00:18:45.416,AND I'M AN ORTHODONTIST.
00:18:45.458,00:18:47.752,WOW.
00:18:47.794,00:18:49.670,"YOU KNOW, YOU WERE RIGHT."
00:18:49.712,00:18:51.422,I THOUGHT WE WERE HAPPY.
00:18:51.464,00:18:52.799,WE WEREN'T HAPPY.
00:18:54.300,00:18:56.928,BUT WITH MINDY...

00:19:29.209,00:19:30.503,HELEN GELLER?
00:19:31.712,00:19:33.673,I DON'T THINK SO.
00:19:33.714,00:19:35.341,IT WON'T BE HELEN GELLER.
00:19:35.382,00:19:36.175,THANK YOU.
00:19:36.216,00:19:38.845,"NO, I MEAN IT'S NOT GELLER."
00:19:38.886,00:19:41.139,IT'S GOING TO BE HELEN WILLICK?
00:19:41.180,00:19:45.852,"NO, ACTUALLY WE TALKED ABOUT HELEN WILLICK-BUNCH."
00:19:47.227,00:19:48.855,"WELL, WAIT A MINUTE."
00:19:48.896,00:19:50.857,WHY IS SHE IN THE TITLE?
00:19:50.898,00:19:52.483,"IT'S MY BABY, TOO."
00:19:52.525,00:19:55.903,REALLY? I DON'T REMEMBER YOU MAKING ANY SPERM.
00:19:58.072,00:20:01.241,"YEAH, AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT A CHALLENGE THAT IS."
00:20:02.326,00:20:03.494,YOU TWO STOP IT.
00:20:03.536,00:20:05.872,"NO, SHE GETS CREDIT, I'M IN THERE TOO."
00:20:05.913,00:20:10.001,"ROSS, YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY SUGGESTING HELEN WILLICK-BUNCH-GELLER?"
00:20:10.043,00:20:11.836,THAT BORDERS ON CHILD ABUSE.
00:20:11.878,00:20:13.129,"UH, OF COURSE NOT."
00:20:13.171,00:20:15.840,I'M SUGGESTING GELLER-WILLICK-BUNCH.
00:20:15.882,00:20:17.133,SEE WHAT HE'S DOING?
00:20:17.175,00:20:19.177,NO ONE WILL SAY ALL THOSE NAMES.
00:20:19.218,00:20:21.428,THEY'LL WIND UP CALLING HER GELLER.
00:20:21.470,00:20:22.847,THEN HE GETS HIS WAY.
00:20:22.889,00:20:24.974,MY WAY?
00:20:25.016,00:20:31.064,"BELIEVE ME, OF ALL THE WAYS I EVER IMAGINED THIS MOMENT IN MY LIFE BEING-- THIS IS NOT MY WAY."
00:20:31.105,00:20:32.065,YOU KNOW WHAT?
00:20:32.106,00:20:34.108,THIS IS TOO HARD-- I CAN'T...
00:20:34.150,00:20:35.109,HOW ARE WE?
00:20:36.152,00:20:37.277,A LITTLE.
00:20:37.319,00:20:39.780,YEAH.
00:20:39.822,00:20:43.910,I WAS JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE MOTHER-TO-BE BUT THANKS FOR SHARING.
00:20:43.951,00:20:45.912,"UH, LIE BACK."
00:20:45.953,00:20:47.329,"UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?"
00:20:47.371,00:20:48.956,I'M GOING TO GO.
00:20:48.998,00:20:53.169,I DON'T THINK I CAN BE INVOLVED IN THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY.
00:21:03.804,00:21:05.347,"OH, MY GOD."
00:21:05.389,00:21:06.807,LOOK AT THAT.
00:21:06.849,00:21:08.350,I KNOW.
00:21:18.360,00:21:20.738,ISN'T THAT AMAZING?
00:21:22.740,00:21:26.535,WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE SEEING HERE?
00:21:28.121,00:21:32.250,"I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT TO ATTACK THE ENTERPRISE."
00:21:34.961,00:21:41.842,IF YOU TILT YOUR HEAD TO THE LEFT AND RELAX YOUR EYES IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE AN OLD POTATO.
00:21:41.884,00:21:43.761,"THEN DON'T DO THAT, ALL RIGHT?"
00:21:43.803,00:21:45.345,OKAY.
00:21:46.931,00:21:47.932,MONICA.
00:21:48.933,00:21:50.350,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:21:50.392,00:21:52.812,MM-HMM.

00:21:56.816,00:21:57.817,YOU'RE WELLING UP.
00:21:57.858,00:21:58.818,"NO, I'M NOT."
00:21:58.859,00:22:00.069,YOU'LL BE AN AUNT.
00:22:00.111,00:22:01.862,SHUT UP.
00:22:02.863,00:22:04.198,"HI, MINDY."
00:22:04.240,00:22:06.742,"HI, I-IT'S RACHEL."
00:22:06.784,00:22:08.161,"YEAH, I'M FINE."
00:22:08.202,00:22:10.746,I-I SAW BARRY TODAY.
00:22:10.788,00:22:12.665,"UH, YEAH, HE TOLD ME."
00:22:12.706,00:22:14.208,"NO. NO, IT'S OKAY."
00:22:14.250,00:22:15.876,"REALLY, IT'S OKAY."
00:22:15.918,00:22:19.379,"I HOPE YOU TWO ARE VERY HAPPY, I REALLY DO."
00:22:19.421,00:22:27.221,"UH, OH, AND MIN, YOU KNOW IF EVERYTHING WORKS OUT AND YOU GUYS END UP GETTING MARRIED AND HAVING KIDS AND EVERYTHING..."
00:22:27.263,00:22:30.766,I HOPE THEY HAVE HIS OLD HAIRLINE AND YOUR OLD NOSE.
00:22:34.854,00:22:39.108,"OKAY, I KNOW IT WAS A CHEAP SHOT BUT I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW."
00:00:03.462,00:00:04.463,"HI, GUYS!"
00:00:04.463,00:00:05.547,"HEY, PHOEBE!"
00:00:05.547,00:00:07.048,"HEY, OH, HOW DID IT GO?"
00:00:07.048,00:00:08.383,"UM, NOT SO GOOD."
00:00:08.383,00:00:10.761,"HE SAID, WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN."
00:00:12.262,00:00:14.181,WHAT? WE SHOULD DO IT AGAIN.
00:00:14.181,00:00:15.432,"THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?"
00:00:15.432,00:00:20.938,"NO, LOOSELY TRANSLATED WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN MEANS YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME NAKED."
00:00:20.938,00:00:23.190,SINCE WHEN?
00:00:23.190,00:00:24.942,SINCE ALWAYS.
00:00:24.942,00:00:26.986,IT'S LIKE DATING LANGUAGE.
00:00:26.986,00:00:30.197,"YOU KNOW, LIKE, IT'S NOT YOU MEANS IT IS YOU."
00:00:31.615,00:00:36.996,OR YOU'RE SUCH A NICE GUY MEANS: I'LL BE DATING LEATHER-WEARING ALCOHOLICS AND COMPLAINING ABOUT THEM TO YOU.
00:00:38.539,00:00:43.002,"OR I THINK WE SHOULD SEE OTHER PEOPLE MEANS HA, HA, I ALREADY AM."
00:00:44.169,00:00:46.005,AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS.
00:00:46.005,00:00:48.173,"OH, YEAH... CUSHIONS THE BLOW."
00:00:48.173,00:00:53.178,LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A KID AND YOUR DOG DIES AND THEY SAY IT WENT OFF TO SOME FARM.
00:00:53.178,00:00:54.471,THAT'S FUNNY.
00:00:54.471,00:00:59.184,"NO, BECAUSE OUR PARENTS ACTUALLY DID SEND OUR DOG UP TO LIVE ON A FARM."
00:01:02.897,00:01:06.608,"WHAT, HELLO? THE MILNERS' FARM IN CONNECTICUT?"
00:01:06.608,00:01:09.194,THE MILNERS HAD THIS UNBELIEVABLE FARM.
00:01:09.194,00:01:13.532,THEY HAD HORSES AND RABBITS TO CHASE AND...
00:01:16.076,00:01:19.079,"OH, MY GOD, CHI CHI!"
00:02:13.133,00:02:16.136,Chandler: SO HOW DOES IT FEEL KNOWING YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE?
00:02:16.136,00:02:24.561,"WARDEN, IN FIVE MINUTES MY PAIN WILL BE OVER BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SENT AN HONEST MAN TO DIE."
00:02:25.604,00:02:27.439,"HEY, THAT WAS REALLY GOOD."
00:02:27.439,00:02:28.523,"YEAH? THANKS, LET'S KEEP GOING."
00:02:28.523,00:02:30.067,OKAY.
00:02:30.067,00:02:34.195,"SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME, DIMONE... HUH?"
00:02:36.239,00:02:40.744,I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO MY CELL BECAUSE IN MY CELL I CAN SMOKE.
00:02:40.744,00:02:41.829,SMOKE AWAY!
00:02:55.550,00:02:59.471,"I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY WHY DIMONE SMOKES IN HIS CELL, ALONE."
00:03:00.848,00:03:02.432,WHAT?
00:03:02.432,00:03:04.434,LET YOUR WRIST GO.
00:03:04.434,00:03:05.644,NOT SO MUCH.
00:03:07.521,00:03:10.482,"ALL RIGHT, NOW, TRY TAKING A PUFF."
00:03:10.482,00:03:13.234,RIGHT.
00:03:13.234,00:03:14.820,"OKAY, NO, GIVE IT TO ME."
00:03:14.820,00:03:17.364,"NO, NO, I'M NOT GIVING YOU A CIGARETTE."
00:03:17.364,00:03:21.200,DO YOU WANT TO GET THIS PART OR NOT? HERE.
00:03:21.200,00:03:24.746,"ALL RIGHT, NOW DON'T THINK OF IT AS A CIGARETTE."
00:03:24.746,00:03:29.417,THINK OF IT AS THE THING THAT HAS BEEN MISSING FROM YOUR HAND.
00:03:29.417,00:03:33.421,"WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING IT, YOU FEEL RIGHT, YOU FEEL COMPLETE."
00:03:33.421,00:03:34.589,DO YOU MISS IT?
00:03:37.759,00:03:40.261,"ALL RIGHT, NOW WE SMOKE."
00:03:42.931,00:03:46.060,"OH, MY GOD!"
00:03:53.483,00:03:59.907,THEY SAY IT'S THE SAME AS THE DISTANCE FROM THE TIP OF A GUY'S THUMB TO THE TIP OF HIS INDEX FINGER.
00:04:06.163,00:04:08.248,THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
00:04:09.457,00:04:11.168,CAN I USE EITHER THUMB?
00:04:13.128,00:04:15.714,"ALL RIGHT, DON'T TELL ME, DON'T TELL ME."

00:14:29.160,00:14:31.454,SO I HAVE A FLAW.
00:14:31.454,00:14:35.082,LIKE JOEY'S CONSTANT KNUCKLE CRACKING ISN'T ANNOYING?

00:16:39.373,00:16:41.083,"I KNOW, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE REALLY HARD."
00:16:41.083,00:16:43.127,"HE'S A BIG BOY, HE'LL GET OVER IT."
00:16:43.127,00:16:45.171,"NO, HE'LL BE FINE."
00:16:45.171,00:16:48.508,IT'S THE OTHER FIVE I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
00:16:48.508,00:16:50.384,DON'T YOU RESPECT YOUR BODY?

00:08:17.122,00:08:20.041,"WELL, YOUR MOM DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT THE BLOBBIES."
00:08:31.303,00:08:33.347,Monica: HOW WAS IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

00:17:45.147,00:17:46.607,"A LITTLE LOUDER, OKAY?"
00:17:46.607,00:17:49.652,THERE'S A MAN ON THE 12th FLOOR IN A COMA WHO DIDN'T QUITE HEAR YOU.
00:17:52.154,00:17:54.448,THEN WHAT?

00:16:14.098,00:16:19.103,"YOU KNOW, IF I CAN ACTUALLY DO MY OWN LAUNDRY THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I CAN'T DO."
00:16:19.103,00:16:23.441,THAT DOES NOT SOUND STUPID TO ME.
00:16:23.441,00:16:26.694,LIKE THE FIRST TIME I HAD TO MAKE DINNER FOR MYSELF AFTER CAROL LEFT ME.

00:17:22.917,00:17:24.752,I CAN'T LIVE ON MY OWN.
00:17:24.752,00:17:26.713,I CAN'T EVEN DO LAUNDRY.
00:17:38.599,00:17:46.941,"SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH UNDERDOG AND THEY COULDN'T GET HIS HEAD TO INFLATE SO, ANYWAY, UM..."
00:17:46.941,00:17:50.277,"HIS HEAD IS, LIKE, FLOPPING DOWN BROADWAY, RIGHT?"

00:18:29.442,00:18:32.528,"NOT REALLY TRUE, IS IT?"
00:18:32.528,00:18:33.905,WHO'S TO SAY WHAT'S TRUE?
00:18:33.905,00:18:35.197,WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

00:08:43.815,00:08:46.318,LET'S JUST LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE.
00:08:46.360,00:08:49.404,CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TRIED TO MOVE THE GREEN OTTOMAN.

00:08:55.702,00:08:57.454,"GUYS, I AM NOT THAT BAD."
00:08:57.496,00:08:59.164,"YEAH, YOU ARE, MONICA."
00:09:00.415,00:09:02.334,REMEMBER WHEN I LIVED WITH YOU?
00:09:02.376,00:09:04.002,YOU WERE LIKE A LITTLE...
00:09:08.006,00:09:09.466,THAT IS SO UNFAIR.
00:09:09.508,00:09:11.343,"OH, COME ON."
00:09:09.508,00:09:15.430,WHEN WE WERE KIDS YOURS WAS THE ONLY RAGGEDY ANN DOLL THAT WASN'T RAGGEDY.
00:09:15.472,00:09:17.765,"OKAY, SO I'M RESPONSIBLE."
00:09:18.975,00:09:21.061,"BUT, HEY, I CAN BE A KOOK."
00:09:23.063,00:09:25.524,"ALL RIGHT, YOU MADCAP GAL."
00:09:27.067,00:09:28.527,TRY TO IMAGINE THIS.
00:09:28.568,00:09:32.406,THE PHONE BILL ARRIVES BUT YOU DON'T PAY IT RIGHT AWAY.
00:09:32.447,00:09:33.365,WHY NOT?
00:09:33.407,00:09:35.158,BECAUSE YOU'RE A KOOK.
00:09:37.077,00:09:40.038,"INSTEAD, YOU WAIT UNTIL THEY SEND YOU A NOTICE."
00:09:40.080,00:09:42.207,I COULD DO THAT.
00:09:42.249,00:09:52.050,"OKAY, THEN YOU LET ME GO GROCERY SHOPPING AND I BUY LAUNDRY DETERGENT BUT IT'S NOT THE ONE WITH THE EASY-POUR SPOUT."
00:09:52.092,00:09:53.843,WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO THAT?
00:09:55.678,00:09:57.097,ONE MIGHT WONDER.
00:09:57.138,00:09:59.974,SOMEONE'S LEFT A GLASS ON THE COFFEE TABLE.
00:10:00.016,00:10:01.142,THERE'S NO COASTER.
00:10:01.184,00:10:03.186,"IT'S A COLD DRINK, IT'S A HOT DAY."
00:10:03.228,00:10:08.191,BEADS OF CONDENSATION ARE INCHING THEIR WAY CLOSER TO THE SURFACE OF THE WOOD.
00:10:08.233,00:10:09.484,STOP IT!
00:10:12.112,00:10:14.114,"OH, MY GOD."
00:10:14.155,00:10:15.782,IT'S TRUE.
00:10:16.950,00:10:19.411,"MONICA, YOU'RE MOM."
00:10:25.250,00:10:27.586,UH-HUH.
00:10:27.627,00:10:29.379,"OH, MY GOD!"

00:10:30.630,00:10:32.299,"OKAY, I'LL BE THERE."
00:10:34.384,00:10:37.637,THAT WAS MY AGENT.
00:10:38.972,00:10:41.933,MY AGENT HAS JUST GOTTEN ME A JOB...
00:10:41.975,00:10:43.893,IN THE NEW AL PACINO MOVIE!
00:10:43.935,00:10:45.520,WHAT?

00:10:48.064,00:10:49.441,CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
00:10:49.483,00:10:50.733,AL PACINO!
00:10:50.775,00:10:53.278,THIS GUY'S THE REASON I BECAME AN ACTOR.
00:10:53.320,00:10:54.488,I'M OUT OF ORDER?
00:10:54.529,00:10:55.905,YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER.
00:10:55.947,00:10:58.366,THIS WHOLE COURTROOM'S OUT OF ORDER.
00:10:58.408,00:11:00.701,"SERIOUSLY, WHAT'S THE PART?"
00:11:00.743,00:11:04.581,JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS OUT THEY PULL ME BACK IN.
00:11:04.623,00:11:06.916,"SERIOUSLY, JOEY, WHAT'S THE PART?"
00:11:06.958,00:11:08.042,UH...
00:11:14.132,00:11:16.510,"I'M HIS BUTT DOUBLE, OKAY?"
00:11:20.639,00:11:23.475,I PLAY AL PACINO'S BUTT.
00:11:25.477,00:11:31.274,HE GOES INTO THE SHOWER AND THEN I'M HIS BUTT.
00:11:31.316,00:11:32.817,"OH, MY GOD."
00:11:32.859,00:11:34.194,"COME ON, YOU GUYS."
00:11:34.235,00:11:37.822,"THIS IS A REAL MOVIE, AND AL PACINO'S IN IT AND THAT'S BIG."
00:11:37.864,00:11:39.366,"OH, NO, IT'S TERRIFIC."
00:11:39.407,00:11:40.617,YOU DESERVE THIS.
00:11:40.659,00:11:46.331,AFTER YEARS OF STRUGGLE YOU'VE FINALLY CRACKED YOUR WAY INTO SHOW BUSINESS.
00:11:48.249,00:11:49.792,"OKAY, FINE, MAKE JOKES."
00:11:49.834,00:11:50.835,I DON'T CARE.
00:11:50.877,00:11:52.879,THIS IS A BIG BREAK FOR ME.
00:11:52.920,00:11:54.464,"YOU'RE RIGHT, IT IS."
00:11:55.465,00:11:58.843,"SO, YOU GOING TO INVITE US ALL TO THE BIG OPENING?"
00:12:08.311,00:12:09.728,YEAH?

00:12:15.318,00:12:16.611,TODAY'S THE BIG DAY.
00:12:16.653,00:12:19.489,"GO INTO THE BATHROOM, USE WHATEVER YOU WANT."
00:12:19.531,00:12:22.534,JUST DON'T EVER TELL ME WHAT YOU DID IN THERE.
00:12:22.576,00:12:23.577,THANK YOU.
00:12:25.161,00:12:27.497,WHERE'S JOEY?
00:12:28.956,00:12:30.833,YOU DON'T WANT TO GO IN THERE.
00:12:30.875,00:12:32.793,"OH, COME ON. WE'RE ROOMMATES."
00:12:34.337,00:12:36.172,MY EYES!
00:12:40.051,00:12:42.095,WHO IS BEING LOUD?

00:12:52.980,00:12:55.483,DO I SENSE A LITTLE BIT OF RESENTMENT?
00:12:55.525,00:12:56.984,"NO, NO, NO RESENTMENT."
00:12:57.026,00:12:58.986,"BELIEVE ME, IT'S WORTH IT."
00:12:59.028,00:13:04.951,YOU KNOW HOW IN A RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE KEY MOMENTS THAT YOU KNOW YOU'LL REMEMBER FOREVER?
00:13:04.992,00:13:08.747,"WELL, EVERY... SINGLE... SECOND IS LIKE THAT WITH AURORA."
00:13:08.787,00:13:12.333,AND I'VE JUST WASTED 35 OF THEM TALKING TO YOU PEOPLE.
00:13:12.375,00:13:15.836,"SO, UH, MONICA, CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THE DOOR?"
00:13:15.878,00:13:17.338,SURE.
00:13:17.380,00:13:25.346,"UH, CHANDLER, YOU KNOW THE OLD MONICA WOULD REMIND YOU TO SCRUB THAT TEFLON PAN WITH A PLASTIC BRUSH."
00:13:25.388,00:13:27.432,I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
00:13:35.898,00:13:37.358,"OKAY, EVERYBODY READY?"
00:13:37.400,00:13:41.738,I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
00:13:41.780,00:13:44.073,LOSE THE ROBE.
00:13:45.074,00:13:46.159,ME?

00:13:47.702,00:13:51.038,OKAY. LOSING THE ROBE.
00:13:54.584,00:13:58.338,"OKAY, EVERYBODY, I'D LIKE TO GET THIS IN ONE TAKE, PLEASE."
00:13:58.379,00:13:59.673,LET'S ROLL IT.

00:14:12.435,00:14:14.354,NO. THAT WAS CLENCHING.
00:14:14.395,00:14:17.856,"WELL, THE WAY I SEE IT, THE GUY'S UPSET, YOU KNOW?"
00:14:17.898,00:14:21.528,"I MEAN, HIS WIFE'S DEAD, HIS BROTHER'S MISSING."
00:14:21.569,00:14:24.405,I THINK HIS BUTT WOULD BE ANGRY HERE.
00:14:24.447,00:14:29.786,I THINK HIS BUTT WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS SHOT BEFORE LUNCH.
00:14:29.828,00:14:30.911,"ONCE AGAIN, ROLLING."
00:14:30.953,00:14:31.912,WATER WORKING.
00:14:31.954,00:14:34.624,AND... ACTION.

00:14:37.627,00:14:38.628,WHAT WAS THAT?
00:14:39.754,00:14:42.298,I WAS GOING FOR QUIET DESPERATION.
00:14:43.508,00:14:48.179,BUT IF YOU HAVE TO ASK...
00:14:52.767,00:14:55.102,"GOD, I LOVE THESE FINGERS."
00:14:55.144,00:14:56.604,THANK YOU.
00:14:56.646,00:14:59.106,"NO, ACTUALLY I MEANT MY FINGERS."
00:14:59.148,00:15:00.608,LOOK AT THEM.
00:15:00.650,00:15:02.610,LOOK HOW HAPPY THEY ARE.
00:15:02.652,00:15:05.112,"OH... OH, MY GOD, I'M LATE."
00:15:05.154,00:15:07.114,"NO, NO, NO, NO."
00:15:07.156,00:15:08.616,"DON'T GO, DON'T GO."
00:15:09.659,00:15:10.618,"DON'T GO, DON'T GO."
00:15:10.660,00:15:11.994,"NO, I HAVE TO."
00:15:12.036,00:15:13.913,LOOK AT THAT-- SHE'S LEAVING.
00:15:16.957,00:15:19.753,"WELL, I THOUGHT YOU TALKED TO RICK."
00:15:19.794,00:15:20.920,IT'S... NOT RICK.
00:15:20.961,00:15:23.506,ETHAN SPENT THE WHOLE DAY WITH YOU.
00:15:23.548,00:15:25.425,"NO, IT'S... IT'S ANDREW."
00:15:29.470,00:15:36.811,"I KNOW THERE'LL BE MANY MOMENTS IN YEARS TO COME WHEN I'LL REGRET ASKING THE FOLLOWING QUESTION, BUT..."
00:15:36.853,00:15:38.813,AND ANDREW IS..?
00:15:38.855,00:15:40.314,HE'S... NEW.
00:15:40.356,00:15:46.654,"SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU'RE NOT COMPLETELY FULFILLED BY RICK, ETHAN AND MYSELF?"
00:15:46.696,00:15:49.323,THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT...
00:15:49.365,00:15:53.661,MOST WOMEN WOULD KILL FOR THREE GUYS LIKE US.
00:15:53.703,00:15:56.414,SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?
00:15:56.456,00:15:58.165,YOU.
00:15:58.207,00:15:59.166,YOU HAVE ME.
00:15:59.208,00:16:00.668,"NO, NO, JUST YOU."
00:16:00.710,00:16:02.629,WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
00:16:02.670,00:16:05.047,LOSE THE OTHER GUYS.
00:16:05.089,00:16:07.508,LIKE... ALL OF THEM?
00:16:08.718,00:16:10.678,"COME ON, WE'RE GREAT TOGETHER!"
00:16:10.720,00:16:12.138,WHY NOT?
00:16:12.179,00:16:20.146,WHY CAN'T WE JUST HAVE WHAT WE HAVE NOW-- JUST TALK AND LAUGH AND MAKE LOVE WITHOUT FEELING OBLIGATED TO ONE ANOTHER?
00:16:24.191,00:16:29.489,"YOU KNOW, PART OF ME WANTS THAT BUT IT'S LIKE I'M TWO GUYS, YOU KNOW?"
00:16:29.530,00:16:32.909,"ONE GUY'S SAYING, SHUT UP! THIS IS GREAT!"
00:16:32.951,00:16:46.339,"BUT THERE'S THIS OTHER GUY-- ACTUALLY IT'S THE GUY WHO WELLS UP EVERY TIME THE GRINCH'S HEART GROWS THREE SIZES AND BREAKS THAT MEASURING DEVICE?-- AND HE'S SAYING, YOU KNOW THIS IS TOO HARD!"
00:16:46.380,00:16:50.593,SO WHICH ONE OF THE TWO GUYS WILL YOU LISTEN TO?
00:16:50.635,00:16:51.678,I DON'T KNOW.
00:16:51.719,00:16:53.972,I HAVE TO LISTEN TO BOTH OF THEM.
00:16:54.013,00:16:56.891,THEY DON'T EXACTLY LET EACH OTHER FINISH.
00:16:56.933,00:16:58.142,WHICH ONE?
00:17:01.228,00:17:03.105,THE SECOND GUY.
00:17:06.108,00:17:07.568,WELL...
00:17:09.821,00:17:13.115,CALL ME IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.
00:17:18.872,00:17:24.460,SORRY. THE FIRST GUY RUNS THE LIPS.
00:17:37.515,00:17:40.560,LOOK AT IT THIS WAY-- YOU DUMPED HER.
00:17:40.601,00:17:49.235,"RIGHT? THIS WOMAN WAS UNBELIEVABLY SEXY AND BEAUTIFUL, INTELLIGENT, UNATTAINABLE..."
00:17:49.276,00:17:53.239,TELL ME WHY YOU DID THIS AGAIN?
00:17:56.075,00:17:57.660,"HEY, MOVIE STAR."
00:17:57.702,00:18:01.622,"HEY, WEREN'T YOU THE GUY WHO PLAYS THE BUTT IN THE NEW AL PACINO MOVIE?"
00:18:03.624,00:18:04.751,NOPE.
00:18:04.792,00:18:07.253,"NO? WHAT HAPPENED, BIG GUY?"
00:18:11.131,00:18:14.468,IT FELT LIKE A BIG GUY MOMENT.
00:18:14.510,00:18:15.678,I GOT FIRED.
00:18:15.720,00:18:16.679,OH...
00:18:16.721,00:18:20.975,THEY SAID I ACTED TOO MUCH WITH IT.
00:18:23.519,00:18:26.146,EVERYONE WILL GO EXPECTING TO SEE ME...
00:18:26.188,00:18:28.441,"JOE, NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL."
00:18:28.482,00:18:30.401,MY MOM WILL.
00:18:31.778,00:18:34.238,THERE'S SOMETHING SO SWEET...
00:18:34.280,00:18:37.408,AND DISTURBING ABOUT THAT.
00:18:37.450,00:18:44.248,"YOU KNOW, I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT CRAPPY PLAYS FOR SIX YEARS AND I FINALLY GET MY SHOT, AND I BLOW IT!"
00:18:44.290,00:18:46.208,MAYBE THIS WASN'T YOUR SHOT.
00:18:51.464,00:18:54.550,DID... DID IT FEEL LIKE YOUR SHOT?
00:18:54.592,00:18:56.844,HARD TO TELL.
00:18:58.096,00:19:00.139,I DON'T THINK THIS WAS YOUR SHOT.
00:19:00.180,00:19:01.891,YOU DON'T GET JUST ONE SHOT.
00:19:01.933,00:19:04.518,I BELIEVE BIG THINGS WILL HAPPEN FOR YOU.
00:19:04.560,00:19:11.692,YOU'VE GOT TO JUST KEEP THINKING ABOUT THE DAY THAT SOME KID WILL RUN UP TO HIS FRIENDS AND GO I GOT THE PART!
00:19:11.734,00:19:14.070,I'M GOING TO BE JOEY TRIBBIANI'S ASS!
00:19:17.073,00:19:19.450,YOU THINK? THAT'S SO NICE!
00:19:20.618,00:19:22.495,OH...
00:19:24.789,00:19:26.248,"I'M SORRY, JOEY."
00:19:26.290,00:19:28.876,"I'M GOING TO GO TO BED, GUYS."
00:19:28.918,00:19:30.377,"GOOD NIGHT, MONICA."
00:19:30.419,00:19:32.755,YOU'RE LEAVING YOUR SHOES OUT HERE?
00:19:34.465,00:19:35.800,UH-HUH.
00:19:37.468,00:19:40.847,REALLY?
00:19:37.468,00:19:43.766,JUST CASUALLY STREWN ABOUT IN THAT RECKLESS HAPHAZARD MANNER?
00:19:43.808,00:19:45.434,IT DOESN'T MATTER.
00:19:45.476,00:19:48.521,I'LL GET THEM TOMORROW...

00:20:05.204,00:20:08.166,Monica: MM-HMM.
00:20:08.207,00:20:11.169,THEY'RE ONLY SHOES.
00:20:11.210,00:20:16.883,"IF IT BOTHERS YOU THAT MUCH, JUST GO OUT AND GET THEM."
00:20:16.924,00:20:18.592,NO. DON'T DO THIS.
00:20:18.634,00:20:19.927,THIS IS STUPID!
00:20:19.969,00:20:22.722,I DON'T HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING.
00:20:25.016,00:20:27.560,BUT THEN EVERYONE WILL KNOW.
00:20:28.978,00:20:32.565,UNLESS I WAKE UP REALLY EARLY AND PUT THEM BACK.
00:20:32.606,00:20:34.650,I NEED HELP.
00:00:00.918,00:00:01.919,EVERYBODY?

00:18:17.680,00:18:20.307,THAT SOUNDS LIKE NANA.
00:18:20.307,00:18:29.233,DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GROW UP WITH SOMEONE WHO IS CRITICAL OF EVERY SINGLE THING YOU SAY?

00:19:06.771,00:19:11.150,I'M NOT SURE I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT.
00:19:11.150,00:19:16.114,DO YOU THINK THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF YOU'D JUST TOLD HER THE TRUTH?
00:19:19.450,00:19:20.618,NO.
00:19:22.495,00:19:25.289,I THINK SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT UNSAID.

00:09:15.013,00:09:16.723,YOU KNOW WHEN TO SPRITZ.
00:09:16.723,00:09:18.599,YOU KNOW WHEN TO LAY BACK.
00:09:18.599,00:09:21.269,REALLY? YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME.
00:09:21.269,00:09:23.771,OOH.
00:09:23.771,00:09:26.149,YOU SMELL GREAT TONIGHT.
00:09:26.149,00:09:28.276,WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
00:09:40.038,00:09:42.623,"LISTEN, DO YOU WANT TO GO GET A DRINK OR SOMETHING?"
00:09:42.623,00:09:44.876,YEAH. THAT'D BE...
00:09:44.876,00:09:46.669,OH.
00:09:46.669,00:09:47.712,WHAT'S WRONG?
00:09:47.712,00:09:50.131,I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
00:09:50.131,00:09:51.216,"OH, WHAT?"
00:09:51.216,00:09:53.427,UM...
00:09:55.970,00:09:57.347,"WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!"
00:10:39.389,00:10:42.225,SO I GUESS YOU ALL SAW IT.
00:10:42.225,00:10:44.727,SAW WHAT?
00:10:46.229,00:10:48.565,YOU KNOW HOW LAUGHTER CAN BE INFECTIOUS.
00:11:07.125,00:11:08.460,HEY.
00:11:08.460,00:11:10.253,SET ANOTHER PLACE FOR THANKSGIVING.
00:11:10.253,00:11:12.339,MY ENTIRE FAMILY THINKS I HAVE V.D.
00:11:14.048,00:11:16.593,"TONIGHT, ON A VERY SPECIAL BLOSSOM..."
00:11:29.606,00:11:34.027,"CIDER'S MULLING, TURKEY'S TURKING, YAMS ARE YAMMING."
00:11:34.027,00:11:36.363,WHAT?
00:11:36.363,00:11:40.408,IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME WITHOUT MOM IN THE KITCHEN.
00:11:40.408,00:11:43.911,GET OUT OF MY WAY AND STOP ANNOYING ME.
00:11:46.873,00:11:48.875,I GOT THE TICKETS.
00:11:48.875,00:11:50.502,FIVE HOURS FROM NOW...
00:11:50.502,00:11:53.087,"SHOOP, SHOOP, SHOOP."
00:11:53.087,00:11:55.798,YOU MUST STOP SHOOPING.
00:11:55.798,00:11:57.800,I'M GOING TO GET MY STUFF.
00:11:57.800,00:12:00.470,"CHANDLER, WILL YOU COME IN ALREADY?"
00:12:00.470,00:12:04.307,I PREFER TO KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE FROM ALL THIS MERRIMENT.
00:12:04.307,00:12:05.642,LOOK OUT.
00:12:14.234,00:12:18.154,"OKAY, WE ALL LAUGHED WHEN YOU DID IT WITH THE STUFFING BUT THAT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE."
00:12:19.864,00:12:21.533,"MONICA, I GOT A QUESTION."
00:12:21.533,00:12:23.535,I DON'T SEE ANY TATER TOTS.
00:12:23.535,00:12:25.870,THAT'S NOT A QUESTION.
00:12:25.870,00:12:27.539,MY MOM ALWAYS MAKES THEM.
00:12:27.539,00:12:28.873,IT'S A TRADITION.
00:12:34.295,00:12:39.758,IT'S BAD ENOUGH I CAN'T BE WITH MY FAMILY BECAUSE OF MY DISEASE.
00:12:41.344,00:12:42.929,ALL RIGHT.
00:12:42.929,00:12:49.018,TONIGHT'S POTATOES WILL BE BOTH MASHED WITH LUMPS AND IN THE FORM OF TOTS.
00:12:55.316,00:12:56.859,AH!
00:12:56.859,00:12:58.861,MOM NEVER HIT.
00:13:02.741,00:13:04.992,"OKAY, ALL DONE."
00:13:04.992,00:13:07.370,"PHOEBE, DID YOU WHIP THE POT..."
00:13:07.370,00:13:10.415,ROSS NEEDS LUMPS.
00:13:10.415,00:13:12.500,"OH, I'M SORRY."
00:13:12.500,00:13:17.838,I THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE THEM WHIPPED AND THEN ADD SOME PEAS AND ONIONS.
00:13:17.838,00:13:19.507,WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?
00:13:19.507,00:13:26.306,'CAUSE THEN THEY'D BE THE WAY MY MOM USED TO MAKE IT BEFORE SHE DIED.
00:13:31.645,00:13:33.730,"OKAY, GOOD-BYE, YOU GUYS."
00:13:33.730,00:13:35.732,THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
00:13:35.732,00:13:37.066,"OH, LOOK."
00:13:37.066,00:13:38.234,"OH, SORRY."
00:13:40.403,00:13:42.656,THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE THING HAS HAPPENED.
00:13:44.783,00:13:46.033,THE BALLOON?
00:13:46.033,00:13:48.578,"NO, THE ACTUAL CARTOON CHARACTER."
00:13:49.828,00:13:52.248,OF COURSE THE BALLOON.
00:13:52.248,00:13:53.916,IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS.
00:13:53.916,00:13:57.754,HE BROKE FREE AND WAS SPOTTED OVER WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.
00:13:57.754,00:13:59.589,I'M GOING TO THE ROOF.
00:13:59.589,00:14:01.591,I CAN'T.
00:14:01.591,00:14:04.302,AN 80-FOOT INFLATABLE DOG LOOSE OVER THE CITY?
00:14:04.302,00:14:05.970,HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN?
00:14:05.970,00:14:07.347,ALMOST NEVER.
00:14:07.347,00:14:08.931,GOT THE KEYS?
00:14:08.931,00:14:10.933,OKAY.
00:14:15.313,00:14:17.064,ANYTIME YOU'RE READY.
00:14:17.064,00:14:18.941,OKAY.
00:14:20.360,00:14:22.320,"OKAY, HERE WE GO."
00:14:26.407,00:14:28.993,"OKAY, WHERE AM I TALKING TO HERE?"
00:14:28.993,00:14:34.374,"I MEAN, THERE IS ONE WAY THAT SEEMS TO OFFER A CERTAIN ACOUSTICAL ADVANTAGE, BUT..."
00:14:36.125,00:14:38.085,JUST AIM FOR THE BUMP.
00:14:38.085,00:14:41.130,OKAY.
00:14:41.130,00:14:43.383,OKAY.
00:14:43.383,00:14:45.426,"OKAY, HERE GOES."
00:14:53.226,00:14:55.562,THIS IS...
00:14:55.562,00:14:56.896,IT'S TOO WEIRD.
00:14:56.896,00:14:58.231,I FEEL STUPID.
00:14:58.231,00:15:00.024,SO DON'T DO IT.
00:15:00.024,00:15:03.236,YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT JUST BECAUSE SUSAN DOES IT.
00:15:03.236,00:15:05.530,"HELLO, BABY."
00:15:08.783,00:15:11.786,I LOVED THE GIANT DOG SHADOW OVER THE PARK.
00:15:11.786,00:15:14.163,DID THEY HAVE TO SHOOT HIM DOWN?
00:15:14.163,00:15:16.082,THAT WAS JUST MEAN.
00:15:17.792,00:15:23.297,"RIGHT ABOUT NOW, THE TURKEY SHOULD BE CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE JUICY ON THE INSIDE."
00:15:24.424,00:15:26.008,WHY ARE WE STANDING HERE?
00:15:28.720,00:15:30.722,YOU'VE GOT THE KEYS.
00:15:30.722,00:15:32.724,"NO, I DON'T."
00:15:32.724,00:15:34.517,"YES, YOU DO."
00:15:34.517,00:15:37.186,"WHEN WE LEFT, YOU SAID, GOT THE KEYS."
00:15:42.108,00:15:46.028,"NO, NO, NO, YOU SAID, GOT THE KE-EYS."
00:15:46.028,00:15:49.532,EITHER OF YOU HAVE THE KE-EYS?
00:15:49.532,00:15:51.325,THE OVEN IS ON.
00:15:51.325,00:15:53.327,I'VE GOT TO GET MY TICKET.
00:15:53.327,00:15:55.121,WE HAVE A COPY OF YOUR KEY.
00:15:55.121,00:15:56.581,GET IT!
00:15:59.166,00:16:00.167,JOEY...
00:16:00.167,00:16:01.168,THAT ONE WILL.
00:16:03.546,00:16:07.133,"AND EVERYONE'S TELLING ME, YOU'VE GOT TO PICK A MAJOR."
00:16:09.844,00:16:14.515,"SO, ON A DARE, I PICKED PALEONTOLOGY."
00:16:14.515,00:16:20.187,"AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M SAYING BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, YOU'RE A FETUS."
00:16:20.187,00:16:23.483,YOU'RE JUST HAPPY YOU DON'T HAVE GILLS ANYMORE.
00:16:23.483,00:16:26.820,"LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO IT."
00:16:26.820,00:16:28.822,YOU CAN SING TO IT.
00:16:28.822,00:16:31.532,I AM NOT SINGING TO YOUR STOMACH.
00:16:31.532,00:16:34.869,HOW'S IT GOING?
00:16:48.007,00:16:50.760,"HEY, UH, DID YOU JUST FEEL THAT?"
00:16:50.760,00:16:52.094,I DID.
00:16:52.094,00:16:53.513,DOES IT ALWAYS..?
00:16:53.513,00:16:56.223,KEEP SINGING.
00:17:06.400,00:17:08.402,I FELT IT.
00:17:16.870,00:17:20.247,CAN YOU GO ANY FASTER WITH THAT?
00:17:20.247,00:17:22.709,I GOT ONE KEY HOLE AND A ZILLION KEYS.
00:17:22.709,00:17:24.544,YOU DO THE MATH.
00:17:24.544,00:17:27.964,WHY DO YOU GUYS HAVE SO MANY KEYS IN THERE ANYWAY?
00:17:27.964,00:17:31.718,FOR AN EMERGENCY JUST LIKE THIS.
00:17:31.718,00:17:43.479,"ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, SMIRKY, IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU AND YOUR STUPID BALLOON, I WOULD BE ON A PLANE WATCHING A WOMAN DO THIS RIGHT NOW BUT I'M NOT."
00:17:43.479,00:17:45.314,I SWEAR YOU SAID YOU HAD THE KEYS.
00:17:45.314,00:17:48.192,I WOULDN'T SAY THAT UNLESS I HAD THE KEYS.
00:17:48.192,00:17:50.528,AND I DID NOT HAVE THE KEYS!
00:17:50.528,00:17:52.989,ENOUGH WITH THE KEYS.
00:17:56.242,00:17:59.161,WHY WOULD I HAVE THE KEYS?
00:17:59.161,00:18:01.330,ASIDE FROM YOUR SAYING YOU HAD THEM?
00:18:01.330,00:18:02.582,BUT I DIDN'T.
00:18:02.582,00:18:03.666,YOU SHOULD HAVE.
00:18:03.666,00:18:05.292,WHY?
00:18:05.292,00:18:07.336,BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS MY RESPONSIBILITY?
00:18:07.336,00:18:10.339,ISN'T IT ENOUGH THAT I'M MAKING THANKSGIVING DINNER FOR EVERYONE?
00:18:12.341,00:18:14.677,SO I'M MAKING DIFFERENT KINDS OF POTATOES.
00:18:21.601,00:18:27.147,JUST AS LONG AS PHOEBE GETS HER PEAS AND ONIONS AND MARIO GETS HIS TOTS.
00:18:27.147,00:18:33.696,IT'S MY FIRST THANKSGIVING AND IT'S ALL BURNED AND...
00:18:33.696,00:18:36.115,AND I...
00:18:36.115,00:18:38.701,"OKAY, MONICA, ONLY DOGS CAN HEAR YOU NOW."
00:18:38.701,00:18:40.995,THE DOOR'S OPEN.
00:18:40.995,00:18:42.329,"OH, GOD."
00:18:46.709,00:18:50.337,"WELL, THE TURKEY'S BURNT."
00:18:50.337,00:18:53.215,POTATOES ARE RUINED.
00:19:00.098,00:19:02.767,THIS DOESN'T SMELL LIKE MOM'S.
00:19:05.144,00:19:06.813,"NO, IT DOESN'T, DOES IT?"
00:19:06.813,00:19:08.106,"BUT YOU WANTED LUMPS, ROSS?"
00:19:08.106,00:19:10.274,"HERE YOU GO, BUDDY."
00:19:12.110,00:19:13.527,"GOD, THIS IS GREAT."
00:19:13.527,00:19:17.740,THE PLANE IS GONE I GUESS I'M STUCK HERE WITH YOU GUYS.
00:19:17.740,00:19:19.408,WE ALL HAD BETTER PLANS.
00:19:19.408,00:19:21.577,THIS WAS NOBODY'S FIRST CHOICE.
00:19:21.577,00:19:23.203,"OH, REALLY?"
00:19:23.203,00:19:27.458,SO WHY WAS I BUSTING MY ASS TO MAKE THIS DELICIOUS DINNER?
00:19:27.458,00:19:28.793,YOU CALL THAT DELICIOUS?
00:19:34.132,00:19:37.010,"NOW, THIS FEELS LIKE THANKSGIVING."
00:19:50.481,00:19:52.108,EW!
00:19:52.108,00:19:53.526,WHAT?
00:19:53.526,00:19:57.113,UGLY NAKED GUY'S TAKING HIS TURKEY OUT OF THE OVEN.
00:19:59.782,00:20:01.492,"OH, MY GOD."
00:20:01.492,00:20:02.910,HE'S NOT ALONE.
00:20:02.910,00:20:07.581,UGLY NAKED GUY IS HAVING THANKSGIVING DINNER WITH UGLY NAKED GAL.
00:20:09.500,00:20:11.669,I'VE GOT TO SEE THIS.
00:20:14.213,00:20:16.465,"ALL RIGHT, UGLY NAKED GUY!"
00:20:16.465,00:20:20.011,UGLY NAKED DANCING.
00:20:20.011,00:20:22.680,IT'S NICE THAT HE HAS SOMEONE.
00:20:33.107,00:20:34.525,SHALL I CARVE?
00:20:35.568,00:20:36.819,BY ALL MEANS.
00:20:36.819,00:20:37.862,ALL RIGHT.
00:20:42.909,00:20:44.869,OKAY. WHO WANTS LIGHT CHEESE?
00:20:44.869,00:20:46.662,AND WHO WANTS DARK CHEESE?
00:20:46.662,00:20:50.541,I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE DARK CHEESE.
00:20:50.541,00:20:52.292,ANYBODY WANT TO SPLIT THIS?
00:20:52.292,00:20:53.335,OH. I WILL.
00:20:53.335,00:20:55.004,MAKE A WISH.
00:20:55.004,00:20:56.923,MAKE A WISH?
00:20:56.923,00:20:59.967,COME ON. YOU KNOW-- THANKSGIVING.
00:21:03.721,00:21:05.765,OOH! YOU GOT THE BIGGER HALF.
00:21:05.765,00:21:06.766,WHAT'D YOU WISH?
00:21:06.766,00:21:09.643,FOR THE BIGGER HALF.
00:21:12.688,00:21:14.440,I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST.
00:21:14.440,00:21:15.691,LITTLE TOAST HERE.
00:21:15.691,00:21:19.946,I KNOW THIS ISN'T EXACTLY THE THANKSGIVING THAT ALL OF YOU PLANNED.
00:21:19.946,00:21:23.783,"BUT FOR ME, THIS HAS BEEN REALLY GREAT. YOU KNOW?"
00:21:23.783,00:21:28.829,I THINK BECAUSE IT DIDN'T INVOLVE DIVORCE OR PROJECTILE VOMITING.
00:21:52.603,00:21:55.022,All: THAT'S SO SWEET.
00:21:57.650,00:21:58.943,AND HEY...
00:22:00.611,00:22:02.071,AND A CRAPPY NEW YEAR.
00:22:02.071,00:22:03.781,HERE. HERE.
00:00:05.005,00:00:08.717,"GUYS, THERE'S SOMEBODY I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET."
00:00:11.178,00:00:12.471,WAIT.
00:00:12.513,00:00:13.681,WHAT IS THAT?
00:00:13.722,00:00:15.557,MARCEL. WANT TO SAY HI?
00:00:15.599,00:00:16.558,"NO, I DON'T."
00:00:16.600,00:00:17.852,"OH, HE IS PRECIOUS."
00:00:17.893,00:00:19.353,WHERE DID YOU GET HIM?
00:00:19.394,00:00:21.647,"MY FRIEND, BETHEL, RESCUED HIM FROM SOME LAB."
00:00:21.689,00:00:23.022,THAT IS SO CRUEL.
00:00:28.570,00:00:31.740,"HEY, THAT MONKEY'S GOT A ROSS ON HIS ASS."
00:00:36.370,00:00:38.622,"ROSS, IS HE GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU?"
00:00:38.664,00:00:40.165,IN YOUR APARTMENT?
00:00:40.207,00:00:43.335,"YEAH. IT'S BEEN KIND OF QUIET SINCE CAROL LEFT, SO..."
00:00:43.377,00:00:45.337,WHY DON'T YOU GET A ROOMMATE?
00:00:45.379,00:00:49.884,I THINK YOU REACH A CERTAIN AGE HAVING A ROOMMATE IS JUST KIND OF PATHE...
00:00:51.927,00:00:53.220,UH...
00:00:53.261,00:00:54.429,THAT'S PATHET.
00:01:48.525,00:01:50.778,I'M DOING ALL NEW MATERIAL TONIGHT.
00:01:50.819,00:01:55.783,I HAVE 12 NEW SONGS ABOUT MY MOTHER'S SUICIDE AND ONE ABOUT A SNOWMAN.
00:01:57.284,00:02:00.037,MIGHT WANT TO OPEN WITH THE SNOWMAN.
00:02:01.038,00:02:02.081,"HI, JOEY."
00:02:02.122,00:02:03.123,HEY.
00:02:03.164,00:02:04.207,"HI, BUDDY."
00:02:04.249,00:02:06.085,"SO, HOW'D IT GO?"
00:02:06.794,00:02:08.629,I DIDN'T GET THE JOB.
00:02:10.839,00:02:13.717,YOU WERE SANTA LAST YEAR.
00:02:13.759,00:02:14.969,I DON'T KNOW.
00:02:15.010,00:02:18.639,SOME FAT GUY'S SLEEPING WITH THE STORE MANAGER.
00:02:18.680,00:02:19.932,HE'S NOT EVEN JOLLY.
00:02:19.974,00:02:21.850,IT'S ALL POLITICAL.
00:02:21.892,00:02:22.977,"SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE?"
00:02:23.018,00:02:28.273,"I'M GOING TO BE ONE OF HIS HELPERS BUT IT'S JUST SUCH A SLAP IN THE FACE, YOU KNOW?"
00:02:28.315,00:02:31.777,DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR NEW YEAR'S?
00:02:35.864,00:02:36.907,NOTHING FOR YOU.
00:02:36.949,00:02:38.241,YOU HAVE PAOLO.
00:02:38.283,00:02:46.374,YOU DON'T HAVE THE PRESSURES-- THE DESPERATE SCRAMBLE TO FIND ANYTHING WITH LIPS SO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY TO KISS WHEN THE BALL DROPS!
00:02:47.835,00:02:53.966,PAOLO IS GOING TO BE IN ROME THIS NEW YEAR'S SO I'LL BE JUST AS PATHETIC AS THE REST OF YOU.
00:02:54.008,00:02:56.343,YEAH. YOU WISH.
00:02:56.384,00:03:01.056,IT'S JUST THAT I AM SICK OF BEING A VICTIM TO THIS DICK CLARK HOLIDAY.
00:03:01.098,00:03:02.808,"I SAY THIS YEAR, NO DATES."
00:03:02.850,00:03:05.853,WE MAKE A PACT-- JUST THE SIX OF US. DINNER.
00:03:07.896,00:03:10.440,I WAS HOPING FOR A LITTLE ENTHUSIASM.
00:03:10.482,00:03:11.817,WHOO!
00:03:11.859,00:03:12.860,SOUNDS GREAT.
00:03:12.901,00:03:14.111,"PHOEBE, YOU'RE ON."
00:03:15.821,00:03:16.822,"OKAY, HI."
00:03:16.864,00:03:22.119,LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND MISS PHOEBE BUFFAY.
00:03:25.204,00:03:26.331,HI.
00:03:27.541,00:03:32.587,UM... I WANT TO START WITH A SONG THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME THIS TIME OF YEAR.
00:04:21.636,00:04:22.763,NOISY BOYS.
00:04:24.514,00:04:28.227,IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH THE ENTIRE GROUP?
00:04:31.521,00:04:32.981,"WELL, COME ON."
00:04:33.023,00:04:40.864,IF IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO DISCUSS WHILE I'M PLAYING THEN I ASSUME IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO HEAR.
00:04:40.906,00:04:43.742,THAT GUY'S GOING HOME WITH A NOTE.
00:04:45.285,00:04:46.536,AHEM. AHEM.
00:04:46.578,00:04:48.622,I WAS... I WAS JUST SAYING...
00:04:48.663,00:04:49.915,COULD YOU SPEAK UP?
00:04:49.957,00:04:51.291,SORRY. I WAS...
00:04:51.332,00:04:58.339,I WAS SAYING THAT I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THAT I'D EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE AND THEN HE SAID...
00:04:58.381,00:05:07.599,"YOU SAID YOU THOUGHT DARYL HANNAH WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THAT HE'D EVER SEEN IN HIS LIFE AND I SAID, YEAH, I LIKED HER IN SPLASH A LOT BUT NOT SO MUCH IN WALL STREET."
00:05:07.641,00:05:08.767,I THOUGHT SHE HAD...
00:05:08.809,00:05:09.768,A HARD QUALITY.
00:05:09.810,00:05:11.686,"AND, UH..."
00:05:09.810,00:05:17.400,WHILE DARYL HANNAH IS BEAUTIFUL IN A CONVENTIONAL WAY YOU ARE LUMINOUS WITH A KIND OF A DELICATE GRACE.
00:05:18.944,00:05:22.656,THEN THAT'S WHEN YOU STARTED YELLING.
00:05:28.829,00:05:32.415,OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK.
00:05:37.171,00:05:40.257,THAT GUY'S GOING HOME WITH MORE THAN A NOTE.
00:05:49.891,00:05:53.145,"PHEEBS, I CAN'T BELIEVE HE HASN'T KISSED YOU YET."
00:05:53.187,00:05:58.942,"I MEAN, GOD, BY MY SIXTH DATE WITH PAOLO HE'D ALREADY NAMED BOTH MY BREASTS."
00:06:01.987,00:06:05.699,"WHOA, DID I JUST SHARE TOO MUCH?"
00:06:05.740,00:06:07.993,JUST A SMIDGE.
00:06:08.035,00:06:10.745,"DAVID'S, LIKE, YOU KNOW, A SCIENTIST GUY."
00:06:10.787,00:06:12.206,HE'S VERY METHODICAL.
00:06:12.247,00:06:13.623,IT'S ROMANTIC.
00:06:13.665,00:06:17.460,DID YOU EVER SEE AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN?
00:06:17.502,00:06:18.712,YEAH.
00:06:18.753,00:06:22.341,"WELL, HE'S KIND OF LIKE THE GUY I WENT TO SEE THAT WITH."
00:06:23.884,00:06:26.887,EXCEPT...
00:06:26.928,00:06:31.183,EXCEPT HE'S SMARTER AND GENTLER AND SWEETER.
00:06:31.225,00:06:32.351,I JUST...
00:06:31.225,00:06:34.936,I JUST WANT TO BE WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.
00:06:34.978,00:06:37.356,"YOU KNOW, DAY AND NIGHT..."
00:06:37.438,00:06:41.068,AND NIGHT AND DAY AND SPECIAL OCCASIONS.
00:06:41.109,00:06:42.736,I SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING.
00:06:42.777,00:06:45.239,YOU'RE GOING TO ASK HIM TO NEW YEAR'S.
00:06:47.406,00:06:49.368,SHE'S GOING TO BREAK THE PACT.
00:06:49.408,00:06:50.702,NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.
00:06:50.744,00:06:51.745,NO.
00:06:51.786,00:06:52.954,"YEAH, COULD I JUST..?"
00:06:55.207,00:06:58.001,"YEAH, 'CAUSE I ALREADY ASKED JANICE."
00:06:58.043,00:06:59.920,COME ON.
00:06:59.961,00:07:01.504,THIS WAS YOUR PACT.
00:07:01.546,00:07:02.630,"I SNAPPED, OKAY?"
00:07:02.672,00:07:04.341,I COULDN'T HANDLE THE PRESSURE.
00:07:04.383,00:07:07.594,"BUT THAT WAS, LIKE, THE WORST BREAKUP IN HISTORY."
00:07:07.635,00:07:09.054,I'M NOT SAYING IT WAS A GOOD IDEA.
00:07:09.096,00:07:10.931,I'M SAYING I SNAPPED.
00:07:12.599,00:07:14.601,HI. SORRY I'M LATE.
00:07:23.193,00:07:25.862,TOO MANY JOKES.
00:07:25.904,00:07:28.615,MUST MOCK JOEY.
00:07:30.784,00:07:33.287,"NICE SHOES, HUH?"
00:07:33.328,00:07:35.914,AH! YOU'RE KILLING ME!
00:07:37.665,00:07:39.251,"OH, ROSS."
00:07:41.378,00:07:43.755,"LOOK, HE'S NOT GOING TO HURT THEM, RIGHT?"
00:07:43.797,00:07:47.134,DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BRING HIM HERE?
00:07:50.137,00:07:52.180,WE HAD OUR FIRST FIGHT THIS MORNING.
00:07:52.222,00:07:55.809,I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH MY WORKING LATE.
00:07:55.850,00:08:00.521,I SAID SOME THINGS THAT I DIDN'T MEAN AND...
00:08:00.563,00:08:02.149,HE THREW SOME FECES.
00:08:05.277,00:08:08.696,IF YOU'RE GOING TO WORK LATE I CAN LOOK IN ON HIM FOR YOU.
00:08:08.738,00:08:10.198,"OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT."
00:08:10.240,00:08:14.828,"OKAY, BUT IF YOU DO, MAKE SURE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE THERE TO SEE HIM, OKAY?"
00:08:14.869,00:08:17.831,"AND YOU'RE NOT, LIKE, DOING IT AS A FAVOR TO ME."
00:08:17.872,00:08:21.042,"OKAY, BUT IF HE ASKS, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE."
00:08:27.466,00:08:35.974,BUT YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY TEST THIS THEORY BECAUSE TODAY'S PARTICLE ACCELERATORS ARE NOWHERE NEAR POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SIMULATE THESE CONDITIONS.
00:08:37.225,00:08:38.935,I HAVE A QUESTION THEN.
00:08:51.490,00:08:52.949,YES.
00:08:52.991,00:08:54.868,"YES, I WAS."
00:08:56.744,00:09:05.337,"BUT, SEE, I WANTED IT TO BE THIS PHENOMENAL KISS THAT HAPPENED AT THIS PHENOMENAL MOMENT BECAUSE, WELL, BECAUSE IT'S YOU."
00:09:05.379,00:09:06.754,SURE. YEAH.
00:09:06.796,00:09:19.767,"RIGHT, BUT, YOU SEE, THE LONGER I WAITED THE MORE PHENOMENAL THE KISS HAD TO BE AND NOW WE'VE REACHED A PLACE WHERE IT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE I, LIKE, SWEEP EVERYTHING OFF THE TABLE AND I'M NOT REALLY A, UH..."
00:09:19.809,00:09:21.561,SWEEPING SORT OF FELLOW.
00:09:25.940,00:09:26.900,I MEAN...
00:09:26.941,00:09:30.320,YOU'RE A SWEEPER TRAPPED INSIDE A PHYSICIST'S BODY.
00:09:30.362,00:09:31.821,REALLY?
00:09:33.407,00:09:34.574,YOU SHOULD JUST DO IT.
00:09:34.615,00:09:35.992,JUST SWEEP AND THROW ME.
00:09:38.953,00:09:40.955,"NOW, NOW?"
00:09:40.997,00:09:42.457,"OH, YEAH, RIGHT NOW."
00:09:42.499,00:09:43.958,"OKAY, OKAY."
00:09:46.420,00:09:49.214,"YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS JUST REALLY EXPENSIVE."
00:09:50.465,00:09:52.551,AND THIS WAS A GIFT.
00:09:53.634,00:09:55.136,YOU'RE KIND OF TIDYING UP.
00:09:55.178,00:09:57.638,OKAY. WHAT THE HELL?
00:10:00.141,00:10:04.062,DO YOU WANT ME TO ACTUALLY THROW YOU OR YOU WANT TO JUST HOP UP?
00:10:21.704,00:10:24.291,WHAT DOES THE PHRASE NO-DATE PACT MEAN TO YOU?
00:10:24.332,00:10:25.459,"I'M SORRY, OKAY?"
00:10:25.500,00:10:28.628,IT'S JUST THAT CHANDLER HAS SOMEBODY AND PHOEBE HAS SOMEBODY.
00:10:28.669,00:10:30.130,I THOUGHT I'D ASK FUN BOBBY.
00:10:30.171,00:10:33.049,FUN BOBBY-- YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND FUN BOBBY?
00:10:33.091,00:10:35.802,YOU KNOW MORE THAN ONE FUN BOBBY?
00:10:35.843,00:10:37.887,I HAPPEN TO KNOW A FUN BOB.
00:10:39.680,00:10:40.890,OKAY. HERE WE GO.
00:10:40.932,00:10:43.684,"OH, OH, OH, THERE'S NO ROOM FOR MILK."
00:10:49.274,00:10:50.858,THERE.
00:10:52.026,00:10:56.531,"OKAY, SO ON OUR NO-DATE EVENING THREE OF YOU NOW ARE GOING TO HAVE DATES."
00:10:56.573,00:10:57.865,UH... FOUR.
00:10:57.907,00:10:59.700,FIVE.
00:10:59.742,00:11:02.829,SORRY. PAOLO'S CATCHING AN EARLIER FLIGHT.
00:11:02.870,00:11:06.666,"YEAH, AND I MET THIS REALLY HOT SINGLE MOM AT THE STORE."
00:11:09.377,00:11:13.881,"OKAY, SO I'M GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONE STANDING THERE ALONE WHEN THE BALL DROPS?"
00:11:13.923,00:11:17.969,WE'LL HAVE A BIG PARTY AND NO ONE WILL KNOW WHO'S WITH WHO.
00:11:18.011,00:11:20.180,THIS IS SO NOT WHAT I NEEDED RIGHT NOW.
00:11:20.221,00:11:21.389,WHAT'S THE MATTER?
00:11:21.431,00:11:23.057,"OH, IT'S MARCEL."
00:11:25.977,00:11:28.146,"HE KEEPS SHUTTING ME OUT, YOU KNOW?"
00:11:28.188,00:11:31.525,HE'S WALKING AROUND ALL THE TIME DRAGGING HIS HANDS.
00:11:34.653,00:11:35.570,REALLY?
00:11:35.612,00:11:37.030,YEAH. WE PLAYED.
00:11:37.071,00:11:39.240,THAT JUGGLING THING IS AMAZING.
00:11:39.282,00:11:45.163,"WHAT, UH... WHAT JUGGLING THING?"
00:11:46.747,00:11:49.209,I FIGURED YOU TAUGHT HIM THAT.
00:11:49.250,00:11:50.793,NO.
00:11:50.835,00:11:52.671,"YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T THAT BIG A DEAL."
00:11:52.711,00:11:54.214,IT WAS JUST BALLED-UP SOCKS...
00:11:54.255,00:11:56.049,AND A MELON.
00:11:59.427,00:12:00.512,"PHOEBE, HI."
00:12:00.554,00:12:01.555,"HI, MAX."
00:12:01.596,00:12:02.972,DO YOU KNOW EVERYBODY?
00:12:03.014,00:12:04.723,NO. HAVE YOU SEEN DAVID?
00:12:04.765,00:12:07.185,NO. NO.
00:12:07.227,00:12:09.937,"WELL, IF YOU SEE HIM, TELL HIM TO PACK HIS BAGS."
00:12:09.979,00:12:11.314,WE ARE GOING TO MINSK.
00:12:11.356,00:12:12.773,MINSK?
00:12:12.815,00:12:14.651,MINSK. IT'S IN RUSSIA.
00:12:14.693,00:12:17.736,I KNOW WHERE MINSK IS.
00:12:19.531,00:12:20.907,THREE YEARS.
00:12:20.948,00:12:23.076,ALL EXPENSES PAID.
00:12:23.117,00:12:25.370,"SO WHEN, WHEN DO YOU LEAVE?"
00:12:25.412,00:12:26.496,JANUARY FIRST.
00:12:39.342,00:12:40.968,WHAT... HEY!
00:12:41.010,00:12:41.886,HI.

00:12:43.971,00:12:47.726,"WELL, MAX TOLD ME ABOUT MINSK SO, YOU KNOW, CONGRATULATIONS!"
00:12:47.766,00:12:50.395,THIS IS SO EXCITING.
00:12:50.437,00:12:53.607,IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE EXCITING IF WE WERE GOING.
00:12:53.648,00:12:55.567,YOU'RE NOT GOING?
00:12:55.609,00:12:57.652,OH... WHY?
00:12:59.028,00:13:02.282,I DON'T WANT TO GO TO MINSK TO WORK WITH LIFSON AND YAMAGUCHI AND FLENCK.
00:13:02.323,00:13:03.782,"OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO."
00:13:06.494,00:13:08.496,"OKAY, THANK YOU, MAX."
00:13:08.538,00:13:10.123,THANK YOU.
00:13:10.164,00:13:12.791,SO... SO YOU'RE REALLY NOT GOING?

00:13:16.713,00:13:18.339,YOU DECIDE.
00:13:18.381,00:13:19.382,"OH, DON'T DO THAT."
00:13:19.424,00:13:20.258,PLEASE?
00:13:20.300,00:13:21.301,I'M ASKING...
00:13:21.342,00:13:23.010,BUT I CAN'T MAKE THE DECISION.
00:13:23.052,00:13:25.096,"OKAY, STAY."
00:13:26.097,00:13:27.806,STAY?
00:13:27.848,00:13:28.849,STAY.
00:13:36.023,00:13:38.901,YOU'RE GETTING SO GOOD AT THAT.
00:13:40.111,00:13:43.197,IT WAS MAX'S STUFF.
00:13:50.622,00:13:52.582,I LOVE THIS ARTICHOKE THING.
00:13:52.624,00:13:54.833,DON'T TELL ME WHAT'S IN IT.
00:13:54.875,00:13:57.003,THE DIET STARTS TOMORROW.
00:14:00.465,00:14:02.258,YOU REMEMBER JANICE?
00:14:02.300,00:14:06.137,OH... VIVIDLY.

00:14:14.187,00:14:15.689,HI. I'M SANDY.
00:14:27.283,00:14:29.118,YOU BROUGHT YOUR KIDS.
00:14:34.582,00:14:35.958,PAR-TAY.
00:14:36.000,00:14:38.837,THAT THING IS NOT COMING IN HERE.
00:14:38.878,00:14:42.340,THAT THING? THIS IS HOW YOU GREET GUESTS AT A PARTY?
00:14:42.382,00:14:46.469,IF I SHOWED UP WITH MY NEW GIRLFRIEND SHE WOULDN'T BE WELCOME?
00:14:46.511,00:14:50.139,YOUR GIRLFRIEND WOULDN'T URINATE ON MY COFFEE TABLE.
00:14:50.181,00:14:53.560,HE WAS MORE EMBARRASSED ABOUT THAT THAN ANYONE.
00:14:53.601,00:14:55.645,OKAY?
00:14:55.687,00:15:02.527,AND FOR HIM TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO WALK BACK IN HERE LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED...
00:15:02.569,00:15:05.154,ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT!
00:15:05.196,00:15:06.781,JUST KEEP HIM AWAY FROM ME.
00:15:09.659,00:15:12.995,WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU AND I DO A LITTLE MINGLING?
00:15:13.037,00:15:17.417,"ALL RIGHT. I'LL, UH..."
00:15:22.881,00:15:24.799,"OH, MY GOSH!"
00:15:24.841,00:15:27.761,"RACHEL, HONEY..."
00:15:27.802,00:15:29.220,WHERE'S PAOLO?
00:15:29.262,00:15:31.222,ROME.
00:15:31.264,00:15:33.015,JERK MISSED HIS FLIGHT.
00:15:33.057,00:15:35.017,AND THEN YOUR FACE EXPLODED?
00:15:36.728,00:15:38.605,NO.
00:15:38.646,00:15:49.657,OKAY. I WAS AT THE AIRPORT GETTING INTO A CAB WHEN THIS WOMAN-- THIS BLONDE PLANET WITH A POCKETBOOK-- STARTS YELLING AT ME.
00:15:49.699,00:15:56.790,"SOMETHING ABOUT HOW IT WAS HER CAB FIRST AND THEN THE NEXT THING I KNOW, SHE JUST STARTS PULLING ME OUT BY MY HAIR."

00:20:20.511,00:20:24.891,"I'M GOING TO MISS YOU, YOU SCIENTIST GUY."
00:20:27.101,00:20:32.272,Dick Clark: We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square.
00:20:32.314,00:20:35.568,It gets bigger and better every year.
00:20:37.904,00:20:41.699,...AND THEN THE PEACOCK BIT ME.

00:20:56.089,00:20:58.174,WHOA! I DID KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU.
00:21:00.218,00:21:02.845,"HEY, EVERYBODY, THE BALL IS DROPPING."
00:21:02.887,00:21:04.471,All: WHAT?

00:21:11.979,00:21:14.356,AND THE MOMENT OF JOY IS UPON US.
00:21:14.398,00:21:18.152,LOOKS LIKE THAT NO-DATE-PACT THING WORKED OUT.
00:21:18.194,00:21:21.239,EVERYBODY LOOKS SO HAPPY.
00:21:21.280,00:21:23.866,NOT EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.
00:21:31.457,00:21:38.923,I'LL JUST THROW THIS OUT: I'M NO MATH WHIZ BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE THREE GIRLS AND THREE GUYS RIGHT HERE.
00:21:40.340,00:21:44.595,"OH, I DON'T FEEL LIKE KISSING ANYONE TONIGHT."
00:21:44.637,00:21:46.430,I CAN'T KISS ANYONE.
00:21:46.472,00:21:48.390,SO I'M KISSING EVERYONE?
00:21:48.432,00:21:49.850,YOU CAN'T KISS ROSS.
00:21:49.892,00:21:51.310,THAT'S YOUR BROTHER.
00:21:51.351,00:21:52.686,"OH, YEAH."

00:22:10.704,00:22:13.624,I WANTED THIS TO WORK SO MUCH.
00:22:22.633,00:22:29.347,"IT'S JUST SO HARD TO ACCEPT THAT SOMETHING YOU LOVE SO MUCH DOESN'T LOVE YOU BACK, YOU KNOW?"
00:22:29.389,00:22:34.145,I THINK THAT BITCH CRACKED MY TOOTH.
00:22:34.187,00:00:03.211,The Caption Center DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE YESTERDAY'S DAILY NEWS?
00:00:03.211,00:00:07.090,I JUST WANT TO CHECK MY HOROSCOPE TO SEE IF IT WAS RIGHT.
00:00:08.216,00:00:15.056,"PHOEBE, DON'T LOOK NOW BUT BEHIND YOU IS A GUY WHO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BREAK OUR HEARTS AND PLUNGE US INTO A PIT OF DEPRESSION."
00:00:15.056,00:00:17.225,WHERE?
00:00:17.225,00:00:18.853,COME TO MAMA.

00:00:25.275,00:00:26.777,WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING-- WHISTLE.
00:00:26.777,00:00:28.570,WE ARE NOT GOING TO WHISTLE.
00:00:28.570,00:00:29.655,DO IT!

00:01:33.052,00:01:34.261,I MUST HAVE YOU NOW.
00:01:35.888,00:01:39.641,I JUST WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING WE COULD DO.

00:01:46.314,00:01:47.858,"PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
00:01:47.858,00:01:49.150,MAYBE NOBODY'S TRIED THIS.
00:01:52.571,00:01:54.281,I WISH WE AT LEAST KNEW HIS NAME.
00:01:54.281,00:01:57.076,WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT FACE?
00:01:57.076,00:01:59.787,"I MEAN, EVEN SLEEPING, HE LOOKS SMART."
00:01:59.787,00:02:01.329,I BET HE'S A LAWYER.
00:02:01.329,00:02:03.373,YOU SEE THE DENTS IN HIS KNUCKLES?
00:02:03.373,00:02:04.959,THAT MEANS HE'S ARTISTIC.
00:02:09.838,00:02:11.423,AND HE CAN DANCE.
00:02:18.639,00:02:20.140,BUT REALLY WONDERING WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE NAKED.
00:02:20.140,00:02:21.809,"OH, DEFINITELY!"
00:02:23.936,00:02:26.396,I WISH ALL GUYS COULD BE LIKE HIM.
00:02:28.273,00:02:29.733,I KNOW.
00:02:34.655,00:02:37.825,ARE THERE NO CONSCIOUS MEN IN THE CITY FOR YOU TWO?
00:02:37.825,00:02:39.827,HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYONE.
00:02:42.245,00:02:45.582,I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID WHOO-HOO.
00:02:45.582,00:02:47.626,I DON'T EVEN SAY WHOO-HOO.

00:02:49.461,00:02:54.549,"When we come back, we'll be talking about her new book Euphoria Unbound."
00:02:54.549,00:02:56.510,You might want to put the kids to bed for this one.
00:02:56.510,00:02:58.095,WE DON'T HAVE TO WATCH THIS.
00:02:58.095,00:03:00.639,WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S IS ON SHOWTIME.

00:03:14.569,00:03:15.779,I CANNOT GET ON A PLANE WITHOUT ONE.

00:04:00.407,00:04:02.034,YOUR MOM WAS ARRESTED?
00:04:07.206,00:04:11.543,"OCCASIONALLY, AFTER I'VE BEEN INTIMATE WITH A MAN..."

00:20:13.046,00:20:16.382,"HE DID IT! HE TOLD HER OFF AND NOT JUST ABOUT THE KISS, ABOUT EVERYTHING."
00:20:16.382,00:20:17.758,YOU'RE KIDDING!
00:20:17.758,00:20:20.594,"HE SAID, WHEN YOU GONNA GROW UP AND BE A MOM?"

00:20:57.965,00:21:01.010,"THEY'RE WALKING AWAY, THEY'RE WALKING AWAY..."
00:21:01.010,00:21:03.262,"NO! NO, THEY'RE NOT!"
00:21:03.262,00:21:04.222,"RUN, RUN!"
00:21:07.558,00:21:08.893,"YOU OKAY, KIDDO?"

00:21:46.889,00:21:49.225,"WELL, SEE?"
00:21:49.225,00:21:51.894,SO MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH A BAD IDEA ME KISSING YOUR MOM.
00:21:51.894,00:21:53.395,HUH? HUH?
00:21:53.395,00:21:55.773,BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD.
00:22:01.320,00:22:10.079,"OKAY. NOW, THIS IS JUST THE FIRST CHAPTER AND I WANT YOUR ABSOLUTE HONEST OPINION. OKAY?"
00:22:10.079,00:22:15.626,"OH! AND ON PAGE TWO, HE'S NOT REACHING FOR HER HEAVING BEASTS."
00:22:15.626,00:22:17.128,WHAT'S A NIFFLE?
00:22:17.128,00:22:20.047,YOU CAN USUALLY FIND THEM ON THE HEAVING BEASTS.
00:22:20.047,00:22:21.674,OH!
00:22:28.139,00:22:31.767,DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND WHEN HE STARTS WRITING WITH THOSE.
00:22:33.894,00:22:35.395,"ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT."
00:00:55.681,00:00:57.683,"No, no, no, no."
00:01:47.357,00:01:49.818,"Aunt Syl, stop yelling."
00:01:49.860,00:01:54.823,"All I'm saying is, if you had told me vegetarian lasagna I would have made vegetarian lasagna."
00:01:56.742,00:01:58.786,"Well, the-the meat's only every third layer."
00:01:58.827,00:02:00.245,May-maybe you could scrape.
00:02:01.622,00:02:03.874,"Ross, did you really read all these baby books?"
00:02:13.133,00:02:14.384,"Ooh, this is cool."
00:02:14.426,00:02:18.221,"It says, In some parts of the world people actually eat the placenta."
00:02:20.724,00:02:22.309,And we're done with the yogurt.
00:02:24.979,00:02:26.271,Sorry.
00:02:26.313,00:02:28.107,"Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor."
00:02:28.148,00:02:29.858,I am not a caterer.
00:02:34.113,00:02:35.530,"Nice talk, Aunt Syl."
00:02:36.740,00:02:38.867,You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
00:02:40.494,00:02:42.037,"Hey, Ross. Listen."
00:02:42.079,00:02:45.540,Do you know that right now your baby is only this big?
00:02:45.582,00:02:47.167,This is your baby.
00:02:47.208,00:02:48.335,"Hi, daddy."
00:02:48.376,00:02:50.045,Hello.
00:02:50.087,00:02:51.713,How come you don't live with mommy?
00:02:54.133,00:02:56.301,How come mommy lives with that other lady?
00:03:01.974,00:03:03.767,What's a lesbian?
00:03:09.148,00:03:10.524,"Honey, you can say it."
00:03:10.565,00:03:12.442,Poconos. Poconos.
00:03:12.484,00:03:16.279,It's like poke-a-nose.
00:03:16.321,00:03:20.534,"Ah, poke-a-nose."
00:03:20.575,00:03:22.243,Hmm.
00:03:29.292,00:03:31.170,So did I hear Poconos?
00:03:34.548,00:03:37.176,Whoo-hoo.
00:03:37.217,00:03:39.136,"- Yeah, that's a big step."
00:03:37.217,00:03:42.514,"- 'I know.' Oh, it's just a weekend."
00:03:42.556,00:03:45.350,"Wasn't this just supposed to be a fling, huh?"
00:03:45.392,00:03:46.685,Shouldn't it be..
00:03:47.519,00:03:48.896,...flung by now?
00:03:50.064,00:03:52.149,"I mean, we are way past the fling thing."
00:03:59.406,00:04:01.700,Nauseous. I'm physically nauseous.
00:04:03.118,00:04:05.537,"What am I supposed to do, huh?"
00:04:07.664,00:04:09.457,I could call immigration.
00:04:26.558,00:04:27.642,Forever.
00:04:39.780,00:04:41.073,You think?
00:04:48.329,00:04:50.958,"- Hey, hey, hey. Come on in."
00:04:55.295,00:04:57.338,"Oh, great."
00:04:57.380,00:04:59.883,"Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat."
00:05:02.552,00:05:04.721,I'm pretty sure that it is. Yeah.
00:05:06.932,00:05:09.726,So I got the results of the amnio today.
00:05:09.768,00:05:11.145,"Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uh.."
00:05:11.186,00:05:12.854,Totally and completely healthy.
00:05:12.896,00:05:14.689,"Oh, that's great."
00:05:19.486,00:05:23.323,"Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?"
00:05:23.364,00:05:25.366,"Uh, that's our friend Tanya."
00:05:35.543,00:05:37.504,"Of course, it's your friend Tanya."
00:05:40.132,00:05:42.383,Don't you wanna know about the sex?
00:05:42.425,00:05:43.593,The sex?
00:05:45.137,00:05:49.557,"Yeah, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together."
00:05:51.392,00:05:52.894,Aah.
00:05:54.896,00:05:56.898,"The sex of the baby, Ross."
00:05:58.775,00:06:00.610,"Oh, you know the sex of the baby?"
00:06:00.652,00:06:02.988,"- Oh. Oh, oh."
00:06:03.030,00:06:05.115,- Do you wanna know?
00:06:05.157,00:06:07.408,"No, I don't wanna know."
00:06:07.450,00:06:12.164,"No, I think, you know, I think you shouldn't know until you look down there and see oh, there it is.."
00:06:13.165,00:06:14.415,...or isn't.
00:06:16.251,00:06:18.503,"Oh, hello, Ross."
00:06:18.545,00:06:19.880,Susan.
00:06:19.921,00:06:21.548,So..
00:06:21.589,00:06:22.841,So did you hear?
00:06:22.883,00:06:25.260,"Yes, we did."
00:06:29.388,00:06:30.473,It really is.
00:06:30.515,00:06:32.433,"- Oh, and do we know?"
00:06:32.475,00:06:36.897,"It's going to be-- Ooh! Ah, hey, hey."
00:06:39.649,00:06:41.151,Oh.
00:06:41.193,00:06:45.030,"Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?"
00:06:45.072,00:06:46.073,Mm-hmm.
00:06:50.244,00:06:52.996,Hey. What?
00:06:53.038,00:06:55.040,"Okay, what-what did we think it was gonna be?"
00:06:55.082,00:06:56.415,"- We thought-- - No, no, no."
00:06:56.457,00:06:58.126,I don't want to know.
00:06:58.168,00:07:01.171,"Okay, you know, I should probably I should probably just go."
00:07:01.213,00:07:03.131,"- Oh, thanks for the books."
00:07:03.173,00:07:05.008,Okay.
00:07:05.050,00:07:06.676,Oh.
00:07:08.053,00:07:09.137,Susan.
00:07:14.517,00:07:16.477,"Alright, who should we call first?"
00:07:16.519,00:07:18.688,Your folks or Deb and Rona?
00:07:22.776,00:07:25.946,- Hello.
00:07:33.328,00:07:34.579,That's the rule.
00:07:35.956,00:07:38.041,What rule?
00:07:38.083,00:07:39.500,"If anything, you owe me a table."
00:07:39.542,00:07:40.919,How'd you get there?
00:07:40.961,00:07:46.425,"Well, I believe this piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio."
00:07:46.466,00:07:47.842,You knew about that?
00:07:47.884,00:07:51.221,"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
00:07:52.973,00:07:55.934,"Okay, okay."
00:07:55.976,00:07:58.103,What do you mean?
00:07:58.145,00:07:59.520,Yeah.
00:07:59.562,00:08:01.189,You think we're ready for something like that?
00:08:02.607,00:08:03.900,Why not?
00:08:03.942,00:08:05.402,"Well, just that it's a pretty big commitment."
00:08:05.444,00:08:07.904,"I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
00:08:07.946,00:08:10.240,- Why? Are you moving out?
00:08:10.282,00:08:11.908,"You'd tell me if you were moving out, right?"
00:08:11.950,00:08:17.456,"Yes, yes. It's just that, look, my last roommate, Kip-- Oh, I know all about Kip."
00:08:17.497,00:08:22.585,We bought a hibachi together and then he ran off and got married and things got pretty ugly.
00:08:22.627,00:08:24.129,Let me ask you something.
00:08:25.213,00:08:26.840,Was Kip a better roommate than me?
00:08:27.799,00:08:29.092,"Oh, don't do that?"
00:08:35.723,00:08:37.892,You've got a couple changes in your schedule.
00:08:37.934,00:08:44.483,Your 4 o'clock herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Summerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
00:08:44.524,00:08:46.026,Okay. Thanks.
00:08:46.067,00:08:48.153,"Oh, here comes your 3 o'clock."
00:08:53.783,00:08:55.785,"Buon giorno, bella Peebie."
00:08:55.827,00:08:57.078,Oh. Paolo.
00:08:59.789,00:09:04.252,"Uh, Racquela tell me.."
00:09:04.294,00:09:06.671,"...you massage, uh."
00:09:06.713,00:09:08.673,"Yeah, well, Racquela's right."
00:09:08.715,00:09:10.550,"Yeah, let's.."
00:09:13.636,00:09:15.596,Oh. Okay.
00:09:15.638,00:09:16.806,I don't know what you just said.
00:09:16.848,00:09:18.641,So let's just start.
00:09:18.683,00:09:20.310,Uh..
00:09:20.352,00:09:21.728,"I am, uh.."
00:09:22.396,00:09:24.772,...being naked?
00:09:24.814,00:09:26.400,"Um, that's really your decision."
00:09:26.441,00:09:30.529,"'I mean, some people prefer, you know' to take off.."
00:09:30.570,00:09:31.863,Being naked.
00:09:33.073,00:09:35.200,I can't believe you don't wanna know.
00:09:35.242,00:09:36.701,"I mean, I couldn't not know."
00:09:40.330,00:09:42.082,And Monica knows.
00:09:42.123,00:09:43.375,Wha..
00:09:43.417,00:09:44.918,How could you know?
00:09:47.379,00:09:49.130,I asked.
00:09:49.172,00:09:50.673,So what's it gonna be?
00:09:50.715,00:09:52.967,Oh. Hush!
00:09:53.009,00:09:54.094,"Huh! Oh, great."
00:09:55.762,00:09:58.265,"I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt."
00:09:58.306,00:09:59.682,Or an uncle.
00:10:05.230,00:10:07.566,"'Hey, Phoebe.' Hi, Pheebs."
00:10:11.861,00:10:14.030,"- Phoebe, what's the matter?"
00:10:14.072,00:10:15.532,I'm just..
00:10:19.994,00:10:21.455,"Oh, right. That's me."
00:10:23.039,00:10:25.917,"Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7:00. Come on."
00:10:25.959,00:10:28.086,Fine.
00:10:31.798,00:10:33.341,Alright. You know Paolo?
00:10:33.383,00:10:35.385,I'm familiar with his work. Yes.
00:10:37.011,00:10:38.305,"Well, he made a move on me."
00:10:38.346,00:10:40.098,Whoa! Store will be open tomorrow.
00:10:40.140,00:10:41.641,More coffee over here please.
00:10:48.815,00:10:50.317,"Hey, what happened?"
00:10:50.358,00:10:54.404,"Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until.."
00:10:57.698,00:10:59.618,- Whoa!
00:10:59.659,00:11:01.911,Are you sure?
00:11:01.953,00:11:03.413,"Oh, yeah, I'm sure."
00:11:08.001,00:11:11.212,And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
00:11:16.092,00:11:17.427,Was it..
00:11:17.469,00:11:20.263,"Oh, Boy Scouts could have camped under there."
00:11:20.305,00:11:22.098,Ooh.
00:11:23.642,00:11:25.185,- Uma Thurman.
00:11:25.226,00:11:26.311,The actress.
00:11:28.938,00:11:30.940,"Thanks, Rach."
00:11:32.733,00:11:34.402,- So what are you gonna do?
00:11:34.444,00:11:38.281,"You have to tell her it's your moral obligation as a friend, as a woman."
00:11:38.323,00:11:39.449,I think it's a feminist issue.
00:11:39.491,00:11:41.034,Guys? Guys?
00:11:41.075,00:11:42.743,"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
00:11:42.785,00:11:44.579,Feminist issue that's where I went.
00:11:46.540,00:11:48.041,She is gonna hate me.
00:11:48.082,00:11:49.543,"Yeah, well.."
00:11:56.966,00:11:59.386,Will you pick one?
00:11:59.427,00:12:01.596,"Here, how about that one?"
00:12:01.638,00:12:03.806,That's patio furniture.
00:12:03.848,00:12:08.603,"So what, like, people are gonna come in and think, uh-oh, I'm outside again?"
00:12:08.645,00:12:10.397,Come on.
00:12:10.438,00:12:11.730,What about the birds?
00:12:13.483,00:12:17.404,"I don't know, birds just don't say hello, sit here eat somethin'."
00:12:19.155,00:12:20.948,- You pick one.
00:12:20.990,00:12:22.367,How about the ladybugs?
00:12:22.409,00:12:26.996,"Oh, so forget about the birds but big, red insects suggest fine dining."
00:12:27.038,00:12:29.123,"Fine, you wanna get the birds, get the birds."
00:12:29.165,00:12:30.500,"Not like that, I won't."
00:12:34.462,00:12:36.214,Kip would have liked the birds.
00:12:46.433,00:12:48.851,- Hey.
00:12:48.893,00:12:50.061,Are you moving out?
00:12:52.313,00:12:54.232,This one's Paulo's.
00:12:54.274,00:12:57.694,'Uh..' Um..
00:12:57.736,00:13:00.196,"Rachel, can we talk for a sec?"
00:13:00.238,00:13:03.450,"Well, sure, just for a sec though 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
00:13:03.491,00:13:04.576,Oh!
00:13:08.622,00:13:10.707,Okay. Um..
00:13:14.168,00:13:16.379,Um..
00:13:16.421,00:13:22.427,"We haven't known each other for that long a time and, um, there are three things that you should know about me."
00:13:22.469,00:13:26.973,"One, my friends are the most important thing in my life."
00:13:29.601,00:13:33.563,"And three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world."
00:13:36.107,00:13:37.858,Okay.
00:13:37.900,00:13:39.611,"Thanks, Pheebs."
00:13:43.740,00:13:45.742,"Oh, my God."
00:13:47.076,00:13:49.245,Why have I never tasted these before?
00:13:49.287,00:13:53.708,"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies."
00:13:57.211,00:14:00.965,"Alright, well, you're right."
00:14:01.007,00:14:03.468,These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had.
00:14:03.510,00:14:05.595,Which proves that I never lie.
00:14:07.722,00:14:09.557,Paolo made a pass at me.
00:14:12.519,00:14:14.312,So what do you think?
00:14:14.354,00:14:16.773,I think it's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
00:14:18.983,00:14:21.695,You're gonna balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
00:14:21.736,00:14:23.904,Who cares?
00:14:26.407,00:14:28.034,"Heads up, Ross."
00:14:28.075,00:14:30.411,Score! You suck.
00:14:33.540,00:14:35.208,Are you okay?
00:14:38.127,00:14:39.629,I need some milk.
00:14:41.214,00:14:42.923,Okay. I've got milk.
00:14:48.429,00:14:50.097,Here you go. Oh.
00:14:58.314,00:14:59.399,Better?
00:15:01.275,00:15:02.402,No.
00:15:04.738,00:15:07.907,"Oh, I feel so stupid!"
00:15:07.948,00:15:14.038,"Oh, I think about the other day with you guys you know and I was all, oh, Paolo, he's so great!"
00:15:14.080,00:15:15.456,He makes me feel so...
00:15:15.498,00:15:17.709,Oh! God.
00:15:18.626,00:15:20.420,I'm so embarrassed.
00:15:20.461,00:15:22.213,I'm so embarrassed.
00:15:23.798,00:15:27.510,"Phoebe, I unleashed him on you, if I had never met him this would have never happened to you."
00:15:27.552,00:15:29.053,I'm so sorry.
00:15:29.095,00:15:30.304,"- No Phoebe, I'm sorry."
00:15:30.346,00:15:31.556,"- No, I'm sorry!"
00:15:31.598,00:15:32.891,"Oh, wait. Oh.."
00:15:34.559,00:15:36.436,I don't know. Right.
00:15:36.477,00:15:38.730,- He's the pig.
00:15:38.772,00:15:40.940,"- Oh, God, he's such a pig!"
00:15:38.772,00:15:42.692,"- Oh, he's like a-- He's like a big, disgusting pig."
00:15:42.734,00:15:44.861,"- Yeah, like a.."
00:15:44.903,00:15:46.613,"Yes, good. Okay."
00:15:50.867,00:15:53.202,"Oh, but he was my pig man."
00:15:55.329,00:15:57.498,How did I not see this?
00:15:58.750,00:16:00.752,"Oh, I know!"
00:16:03.129,00:16:08.760,Because he's gorgeous and he's charming..
00:16:08.802,00:16:12.179,"And when he looks at you-- - Okay, okay, Pheebs."
00:16:18.603,00:16:20.480,Should I not have told you?
00:16:20.521,00:16:22.189,"No. No, trust me."
00:16:22.231,00:16:24.567,It's-it's-it's much better that I know.
00:16:27.987,00:16:31.616,"Uh, I just liked it better before it was better."
00:16:48.716,00:16:50.677,I think she took it pretty well.
00:16:50.718,00:16:53.346,"You know, Paolo's over there right now, so.."
00:16:53.387,00:16:54.555,We should get over there and see if she's okay.
00:16:54.597,00:16:57.433,- What? Oh.
00:16:58.518,00:16:59.560,Score.
00:16:59.602,00:17:01.395,- Game. Nice.
00:17:03.189,00:17:06.150,"- Come on, Pheebs."
00:17:06.192,00:17:09.195,"Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts."
00:17:09.236,00:17:10.697,"No, no, she kicked our butts."
00:17:10.738,00:17:12.699,You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
00:17:13.741,00:17:14.993,"Come on, two on one."
00:17:15.034,00:17:16.327,What are you still doing here?
00:17:16.369,00:17:17.954,She just broke up with the guy.
00:17:17.996,00:17:19.580,It's time for you to swoop in.
00:17:21.123,00:17:24.293,- What? Now?
00:17:24.335,00:17:28.214,You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there the first guy Rachel sees is you.
00:17:30.800,00:17:32.927,You're like-like the Anti-Paolo.
00:17:34.804,00:17:36.931,My Catholic friend is right.
00:17:36.973,00:17:39.308,She's distraught.
00:17:39.350,00:17:42.729,"You pick up the pieces, and then, you usher in.."
00:17:53.364,00:17:55.157,"Ascolta, ascolta, ascolta.."
00:18:00.204,00:18:02.957,"Okay, she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony."
00:18:02.999,00:18:06.961,"'Now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm waving.' Okay, that is either, how could you?"
00:18:07.003,00:18:08.880,or enormous breasts.
00:18:11.215,00:18:12.800,- Here he comes.
00:18:21.517,00:18:25.271,"Uh, I am, uh.."
00:18:25.312,00:18:27.065,...to say goodbye.
00:18:27.147,00:18:28.775,"Okay, buh-bye."
00:18:32.111,00:18:33.821,Paolo..
00:18:33.863,00:18:39.911,I really hate you for what you did to Rachel but I still have five of these so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
00:18:42.204,00:18:43.330,Grazie.
00:18:45.374,00:18:51.005,"Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I-I think I'd speak for everyone when I say.."
00:18:56.719,00:18:58.763,"Oh, just look at her."
00:19:02.100,00:19:03.851,- So she's not overwhelmed.
00:19:03.893,00:19:05.979,And I really think it should be me.
00:19:23.537,00:19:25.331,You alright?
00:19:25.372,00:19:27.750,"Oh, I've been better."
00:19:32.296,00:19:33.923,Come here.
00:19:40.888,00:19:44.934,"Listen, you deserve so much better than him."
00:19:44.976,00:19:48.187,"You know, I mean, you, you.."
00:19:48.228,00:19:51.607,You should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
00:19:52.859,00:19:55.028,"Oh, Ross."
00:19:55.862,00:19:56.946,What?
00:19:57.822,00:20:00.950,I'm so sick of guys.
00:20:00.992,00:20:03.369,I don't wanna look at another guy.
00:20:03.410,00:20:05.830,I don't wanna think about another guy.
00:20:05.872,00:20:08.332,I-I don't even want to be near another guy.
00:20:12.378,00:20:13.838,Huh.
00:20:16.507,00:20:17.800,"Oh, Ross, you're so great."
00:20:17.842,00:20:19.343,"Yeah, ooh.."
00:20:30.229,00:20:31.814,"Hey, honey, are you alright?"
00:20:31.856,00:20:32.940,- Hmm.
00:20:32.982,00:20:34.608,Medium.
00:20:34.650,00:20:36.777,- Any cookies left?
00:20:39.822,00:20:44.368,"See, Rach, um, see, I don't think that swearing off guys, uh, altogether is the answer."
00:20:51.333,00:20:54.962,"No. No, I just need to be by myself for a while, you know?"
00:20:55.004,00:20:56.756,I just got to figure out what I want.
00:20:56.797,00:20:59.258,"Uh, no, no."
00:20:59.299,00:21:03.596,"See-see, because not-not all guys out there are gonna be a-a Paolo."
00:21:03.637,00:21:08.976,"No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not gonna grow up to be one."
00:21:10.811,00:21:12.312,- What?
00:21:20.279,00:21:23.449,"No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy."
00:21:23.490,00:21:26.077,"Oh, I'm having, I'm having a boy."
00:21:27.703,00:21:29.247,Huh? Am I having a boy?
00:21:29.288,00:21:31.874,You're having a boy!
00:21:31.916,00:21:33.167,- I'm-I'm having a boy!
00:21:33.209,00:21:34.418,"Oh, I'm having a boy!"
00:21:34.460,00:21:35.711,What? What? What is it?
00:21:35.753,00:21:38.172,I'm having a boy!
00:21:38.214,00:21:39.966,Hey.
00:21:41.801,00:21:43.970,We already knew that.
00:21:47.014,00:21:48.849,I'm having a son.
00:21:51.560,00:21:53.062,Um..
00:21:56.690,00:21:59.485,Yes! And that would be a shut-down.
00:21:59.526,00:22:00.903,Shut-out!
00:22:04.240,00:22:06.617,Where are you guys goin'?
00:22:06.659,00:22:08.494,"Oh, it's 2:30 in the mornin'."
00:22:08.535,00:22:11.164,Yeah. Get out.
00:22:11.205,00:22:14.000,You guys are always hanging out in my apartment.
00:22:14.041,00:22:16.877,"Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?"
00:22:16.919,00:22:19.046,"Come on, wussies."
00:22:22.424,00:22:25.261,"- Alright, okay, I gotta go."
00:22:25.303,00:22:26.720,I'm goin'.
00:22:26.762,00:22:28.555,And I'm gone.
