00:00:48.298,00:00:50.925,"Oh, hey. I've been working on this all morning."
00:00:51.009,00:00:53.887,"And I think you'll agree, it's pretty cat-tastic."
00:00:59.184,00:01:02.771,"His Royal Cuteness, King Floyd!"
00:01:04.647,00:01:09.194,Oh! You know what that sound means. It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery.
00:01:09.360,00:01:10.528,"Come on, Pandy."
00:01:21.581,00:01:25.585,"All right, let's see what's inside of our Meow Meow Mailbox today."
00:01:30.340,00:01:31.883,Fancy!
00:01:35.637,00:01:37.222,And the cool sunglasses.
00:01:37.305,00:01:38.473,Should we open it?
00:01:38.681,00:01:40.433,Of course we should. Yeah.
00:01:42.227,00:01:43.520,Ooh.
00:01:43.728,00:01:45.438,"OK, let's see."
00:01:48.149,00:01:49.150,OK.
00:01:50.860,00:01:55.698,It's a little camera with a kitty face on it.
00:01:56.491,00:01:57.992,"Hey, check this out."
00:02:09.712,00:02:10.755,Whoa!
00:02:10.839,00:02:13.133,And now I'm a cat on a surfboard.
00:02:19.222,00:02:25.436,And now I'm a cat on a surfboard in space!
00:02:25.895,00:02:27.981,"Hey, Pandy, want to get one of us together?"
00:02:30.400,00:02:33.111,"Say, Cheesy-cat!"
00:02:33.278,00:02:34.487,Cheesy-cat!
00:02:41.744,00:02:42.745,Hey!
00:02:42.996,00:02:46.749,We should take this into the Dollhouse and take a picture with all the Gabby Cats.
00:02:46.833,00:02:47.834,Come on!
00:02:50.795,00:02:51.629,This...
00:02:53.590,00:02:58.595,"is Daniel James Catnip, but we call him DJ Catnip for short."
00:02:58.803,00:03:02.140,He can help us get all the Gabby Cats together for a picture.
00:03:04.642,00:03:11.941,"With these magical cat ears, I can shrink down and play with the Gabby Cats inside my Dollhouse."
00:03:12.567,00:03:14.903,Time to get tiny.
00:03:26.497,00:03:28.416,"Hey, I'm in the Music Room!"
00:03:28.791,00:03:29.792,Come on in!
00:03:32.045,00:03:34.047,Welcome to my Dollhouse!
00:03:34.464,00:03:36.716,Pandy's in here somewhere.
00:03:36.966,00:03:40.470,"Oh, Pandy Paws, come out and play!"
00:03:42.263,00:03:43.348,Do you see him?
00:03:47.477,00:03:48.686,I don't see him.
00:03:53.775,00:03:57.028,"Wow, Pandy! A musical hug attack."
00:03:57.487,00:03:59.239,I'm a cat of many talents.
00:04:09.958,00:04:13.002,Gabby! Pandy! Boogie on over here and give me some paw!
00:04:16.506,00:04:17.924,"Yeah, that's right!"
00:04:18.007,00:04:19.342,"Hi, DJ Catnip."
00:04:19.425,00:04:22.136,Can we take your picture with our new GabbyCatCam?
00:04:22.345,00:04:23.554,Of course!
00:04:23.638,00:04:26.057,"You got to say, Cheesy-cat!"
00:04:26.140,00:04:27.642,Cheesy-cat!
00:04:37.151,00:04:39.529,We want to get a picture with the Gabby Cats.
00:04:39.612,00:04:43.157,-Can you call them for us? -Of course I can!
00:04:46.452,00:04:51.833,"If you want to be in our photo, dance on down to the Music Room!"
00:05:15.857,00:05:16.691,"Hey, everyone!"
00:05:16.858,00:05:19.235,We got a cat-tastic new camera.
00:05:19.319,00:05:21.654,Let's take a group photo. Come on!
00:05:27.618,00:05:29.912,"OK, everybody get together."
00:05:31.497,00:05:34.667,"Pandy, why don't you come here in the front? OK."
00:05:42.967,00:05:46.471,No picture is complete without the CatRat.
00:05:46.721,00:05:47.805,"Hey, CatRat."
00:05:49.307,00:05:52.977,"OK, when the timer goes off, the camera will take our picture."
00:05:53.728,00:05:55.229,"Quick, CatRat, squeeze in!"
00:05:55.313,00:05:57.065,-CatRat squeezing in. -Look out!
00:05:57.148,00:05:58.608,Watch out. Coming through.
00:05:58.691,00:06:02.070,"Don't worry, there's plenty of CatRat to go around."
00:06:02.528,00:06:06.991,"OK, everyone say, Cheesy-cat!"
00:06:14.123,00:06:15.958,"So, how do we look?"
00:06:16.167,00:06:18.753,Well... it's a good picture of CatRat.
00:06:22.048,00:06:26.010,"Hey, it's not my fault everyone wants to be next to me in the picture."
00:06:26.094,00:06:29.430,"Oh, CatRat! Let's just take a few more."
00:06:29.764,00:06:31.182,"Everyone, get together."
00:06:34.185,00:06:36.354,"Say, Cheesy-cat!"
00:06:39.732,00:06:40.942,CatRat!
00:06:41.400,00:06:42.443,CatRat!
00:06:42.652,00:06:43.486,CatRat!
00:06:43.820,00:06:44.946,CatRat!
00:06:45.363,00:06:46.405,CatRat!
00:06:46.781,00:06:47.782,CatRat!
00:06:48.825,00:06:53.412,"Wow. You guys really don't know how to pose for a picture, do you?"
00:06:53.746,00:06:58.126,"I could see why you'd say that, but I think it's also great how silly they all are."
00:07:00.837,00:07:02.296,They are pretty funny.
00:07:02.421,00:07:05.049,Look at my face in this one. It's all...
00:07:05.424,00:07:06.467,Bleugh!
00:07:16.352,00:07:19.397,I have a cat-tastic idea for this camera.
00:07:19.480,00:07:21.065,They're gonna love it!
00:07:24.193,00:07:25.194,Let's do it!
00:07:26.904,00:07:30.450,Huh. That's strange. Our GabbyCatCam is gone.
00:07:32.243,00:07:34.287,And so is CatRat.
00:07:39.292,00:07:41.794,-He did! -I wonder where he went.
00:07:44.964,00:07:47.508,Sounds like... the Kitchen.
00:07:47.717,00:07:48.718,Come on!
00:07:53.222,00:07:54.223,CatRat?
00:07:54.307,00:07:56.684,Huh. I don't see him anywhere.
00:08:01.314,00:08:03.816,Toast! With a picture on it!
00:08:03.900,00:08:05.193,What's the picture of?
00:08:08.321,00:08:10.156,And he wrote a note on the back.
00:08:10.823,00:08:13.493,Welcome to the CatRat Scavenger Hunt.
00:08:13.951,00:08:16.537,Yay! I love scavenger hunts!
00:08:16.829,00:08:18.498,Follow my picture clues.
00:08:18.664,00:08:23.586,"If you collect everything on my hunt, you'll get a CatRat-tastic surprise."
00:08:23.669,00:08:25.838,"Oh, I love surprises!"
00:08:25.922,00:08:29.383,Whee!
00:08:36.724,00:08:40.061,Another picture! I think it's a scavenger hunt clue.
00:08:40.728,00:08:43.356,Yeah. That's why he took the camera.
00:08:43.439,00:08:48.277,CatRat is leaving us picture clues for all the things we need to collect on his scavenger hunt.
00:08:52.281,00:08:54.158,"pickle, cheese and..."
00:08:54.825,00:08:55.868,hot sauce?
00:08:56.077,00:08:59.580,"Pandy, you can't judge a sandwich until you've tasted it."
00:08:59.747,00:09:02.124,CatRat loves this sandwich.
00:09:02.333,00:09:03.251,Look!
00:09:05.044,00:09:07.713,We've got the ingredients right here.
00:09:07.964,00:09:11.217,"Bread, pickle, cheese, and hot sauce!"
00:09:11.425,00:09:14.762,This recipe calls for a pretty big sandwich.
00:09:15.263,00:09:19.183,And we have a scavenger hunt to finish. So let's give it a go!
00:09:19.475,00:09:21.143,Wahoo!
00:09:24.939,00:09:26.274,I'm Chef Pandy.
00:09:26.357,00:09:28.067,And I'm Cakey the Cook.
00:09:28.442,00:09:32.655,Today we'll be making CatRat's favorite sandwich.
00:09:34.490,00:09:37.702,Let's make CatRat's favorite sandwich together!
00:09:38.578,00:09:41.038,It's his favorite sammy ever!
00:09:42.373,00:09:43.374,-Bread. -Pickle.
00:09:43.457,00:09:44.292,Cheese.
00:09:53.009,00:09:54.719,What comes next?
00:09:55.803,00:09:57.638,-Cheese. -And hot sauce.
00:10:03.936,00:10:05.187,Hot sauce!
00:10:24.582,00:10:25.583,Phew!
00:10:25.791,00:10:28.919,That's the biggest sandwich I've ever seen!
00:10:29.003,00:10:32.423,CatRat's gonna lose his whiskers when he sees this!
00:10:36.636,00:10:38.012,An airplane!
00:10:41.432,00:10:43.100,And another picture.
00:10:43.434,00:10:49.065,It's a picture of CatRat in a big jar of pom-poms?
00:10:49.940,00:10:51.984,CatRat must be in the Craft Room.
00:10:52.068,00:10:54.945,That's where we have to go next on our scavenger hunt!
00:11:00.826,00:11:02.912,Don't forget CatRat's sandwich.
00:11:07.124,00:11:09.210,"-Thanks, Cakey. -See you later."
00:11:09.293,00:11:10.294,Good luck!
00:11:14.840,00:11:17.760,Hmm. How did these get all over the place?
00:11:23.516,00:11:24.517,Huh?
00:11:27.478,00:11:29.438,"Hi, Gabby. Hi, Pandy."
00:11:29.563,00:11:31.649,-We're on a scavenger hunt. -Yeah.
00:11:31.899,00:11:33.025,CatRat set it up.
00:11:33.109,00:11:36.320,He's leaving us picture clues for everything we need to collect.
00:11:36.404,00:11:40.199,"-Have you seen any pictures around here? -Nope, but I'll help you look."
00:11:42.618,00:11:44.829,"Oh, Baby Box, behind you."
00:11:52.586,00:11:54.255,How did that get there?
00:11:55.673,00:11:57.174,Another picture clue.
00:11:57.508,00:12:03.097,"Well, it's a picture of CatRat wearing a silly hat... on a stick?"
00:12:03.722,00:12:05.975,"Oh, I love making those."
00:12:06.058,00:12:09.937,"You can make hats, sunglasses, all kinds of things."
00:12:10.020,00:12:13.482,That must be the next thing we need to collect for our scavenger hunt.
00:12:13.566,00:12:15.443,Silly hats on sticks!
00:12:16.026,00:12:18.404,"Baby Box, can you show us how to make them?"
00:12:18.487,00:12:19.905,You bet I can!
00:12:20.531,00:12:22.241,Let's get crafting!
00:12:24.243,00:12:27.329,"OK, the first thing you do is draw a hat."
00:12:28.914,00:12:30.458,Any kind of hat you want.
00:12:31.542,00:12:32.835,I'm gonna make...
00:12:35.671,00:12:39.049,a magic top hat with a glittery band on it.
00:12:40.009,00:12:41.093,"Oh, I know!"
00:12:42.136,00:12:43.888,I'm making a cowboy hat!
00:12:44.555,00:12:47.683,Got to put on some tape to add a little more cowboy style.
00:12:48.309,00:12:49.727,Yee-haw!
00:12:49.935,00:12:51.770,I know what hat I want to make.
00:12:52.938,00:12:56.066,I'm gonna make a Viking helmet!
00:12:56.233,00:12:58.444,And I'll add some stick-on gems.
00:13:03.115,00:13:04.116,Ta-da!
00:13:04.700,00:13:07.870,Then you cut it out with safety scissors.
00:13:16.462,00:13:18.297,"Next, you tape on your stick."
00:13:19.048,00:13:21.759,"Turn it over, and tape it on the back."
00:13:22.801,00:13:25.304,There you have it! A hat on a stick.
00:13:25.888,00:13:29.058,"Oh, I'm gonna make something else to go with my hat!"
00:13:29.183,00:13:31.310,"Oh! Me, too! Me, too!"
00:13:32.144,00:13:36.482,I'm gonna make some silly glasses with this sparkly paper.
00:13:37.233,00:13:40.110,"Hey, guys, you ready for my magic trick?"
00:13:41.320,00:13:42.696,Ta-da!
00:13:43.531,00:13:44.949,Just like magic!
00:13:45.950,00:13:47.326,"Well, howdy, partners!"
00:13:47.451,00:13:51.372,"I reckon I should introduce y'all to my trusty companion, Jake."
00:13:52.373,00:13:54.124,Neigh!
00:13:54.625,00:13:55.834,Whoa-ho-ho!
00:13:56.001,00:13:57.211,"Easy there, boy!"
00:13:59.630,00:14:02.716,I'm a Viking... on vacation!
00:14:06.470,00:14:08.180,"Look, another picture clue!"
00:14:11.600,00:14:14.853,Huh? Is CatRat in bed?
00:14:17.231,00:14:19.149,That must be where we have to go next.
00:14:20.150,00:14:21.318,To the Bedroom!
00:14:21.610,00:14:22.820,"Bye, Baby Box."
00:14:22.903,00:14:24.822,-Thanks for your help. -Bye!
00:14:28.993,00:14:30.327,"Hey, Pillow Cat."
00:14:33.789,00:14:35.708,We're on CatRat's scavenger hunt.
00:14:35.791,00:14:38.669,We think he left our next picture clue in here somewhere.
00:14:38.752,00:14:40.004,A picture clue?
00:14:40.087,00:14:42.923,Yeah. Have you seen any strange pictures in here?
00:14:43.132,00:14:44.216,"No, I haven't."
00:14:44.300,00:14:47.011,But I've been pretty caught up in my new book.
00:14:47.970,00:14:51.098,"Hey, is this what you're looking for?"
00:14:51.765,00:14:52.766,That's it!
00:14:58.105,00:15:00.524,But it looks like he's in a disguise.
00:15:02.151,00:15:03.694,"Oh, a costume!"
00:15:04.153,00:15:07.489,CatRat must want us to bring him things from the Dress-Up Closet.
00:15:07.698,00:15:08.866,I'll go first.
00:15:14.204,00:15:16.790,"Hi, Dress-Up Closet. Can I come in?"
00:15:18.250,00:15:19.376,"Why, thank you!"
00:15:31.013,00:15:32.056,What am I?
00:15:33.766,00:15:34.975,An astronaut!
00:15:40.522,00:15:42.566,"Oh, this is paw-tastic!"
00:15:46.320,00:15:47.321,Here I come!
00:15:47.696,00:15:48.697,Ta-da!
00:15:52.618,00:15:53.619,What am I?
00:15:55.287,00:15:57.414,"Yeah, I'm a basketball player."
00:15:58.916,00:16:01.251,"Ooh, it's my turn!"
00:16:13.389,00:16:14.640,Bawk-bawk-bawk!
00:16:15.224,00:16:16.225,Bawk!
00:16:16.475,00:16:17.643,What am I?
00:16:18.978,00:16:20.688,I'm a chicken!
00:16:20.771,00:16:22.815,Bawk-bawk! Bawk-bawk-bawk!
00:16:27.736,00:16:28.570,Look!
00:16:30.739,00:16:32.408,Another picture clue!
00:16:40.249,00:16:45.004,-He must be in the Music Room. -Let's bring him everything we collected.
00:16:45.504,00:16:46.588,"Come on, Pandy."
00:16:53.887,00:16:55.264,Bawk-bawk! Bye!
00:17:04.440,00:17:05.482,CatRat!
00:17:07.609,00:17:09.695,Did you bring everything I asked for?
00:17:09.778,00:17:12.364,"You bet we did! Show him, Pandy."
00:17:13.907,00:17:16.201,Got it all right here in my Pandy Pack.
00:17:17.327,00:17:22.082,"We've got hats on sticks, silly costumes, even my trusty horse, Jake!"
00:17:22.166,00:17:23.834,Neigh!
00:17:24.960,00:17:26.420,Nicely done!
00:17:27.046,00:17:31.508,Are you ready for your CatRat-tastic surprise?
00:17:32.051,00:17:33.302,You bet we are!
00:17:33.510,00:17:34.887,"Drumroll, please!"
00:17:44.897,00:17:47.941,I made you a photo booth! What do you think?
00:17:48.817,00:17:50.069,A photo booth!
00:17:51.070,00:17:52.404,For our camera!
00:17:55.032,00:18:00.079,And we can use all the things we collected to make our pictures even sillier!
00:18:00.662,00:18:03.749,Yep! But the best part of all is...
00:18:05.375,00:18:06.376,Ta-da!
00:18:06.543,00:18:07.544,Me!
00:18:07.628,00:18:09.963,Now I can be in everyone's picture.
00:18:10.464,00:18:13.550,Who wants a picture with the CatRat?
00:18:15.135,00:18:16.136,I do!
00:18:17.805,00:18:18.931,"Hey! Me, too!"
00:18:25.896,00:18:27.940,"Say, CatRat!"
00:18:32.861,00:18:33.904,Paw-some!
00:18:34.113,00:18:34.947,See?
00:18:35.405,00:18:37.616,No more pushing or shoving.
00:18:37.699,00:18:41.161,Now everyone gets a picture with the CatRat.
00:18:41.245,00:18:42.454,I'm built right in.
00:18:45.833,00:18:49.128,"Hey, CatRat, what do we use the giant sandwich for?"
00:18:49.336,00:18:51.130,"Oh, thanks. That's for me."
00:18:52.172,00:18:56.510,Mm. I needed a little snack to keep me going after all that hard work.
00:19:03.058,00:19:06.061,Welcome to my CatRat-tastic photo booth!
00:19:06.145,00:19:09.481,"-Ooh, Cakey, take a picture with me! -Sure, I will!"
00:19:09.565,00:19:11.525,-These glasses! -This is gonna look great!
00:19:11.608,00:19:13.402,This is gonna be so cool.
00:19:13.652,00:19:15.654,"No rushing, no crowding."
00:19:15.737,00:19:18.991,Everybody gets a chance to sit with the CatRat.
00:19:41.430,00:19:42.514,"Thanks, CatRat."
00:19:46.435,00:19:47.811,"Oh, CatRat."
00:19:49.688,00:19:52.149,Thanks for playing in my Dollhouse with me today.
00:19:52.357,00:19:54.943,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:20:10.125,00:20:11.168,It's me...
00:20:12.252,00:20:14.004,Baby Box!
00:20:16.298,00:20:20.010,I'm so glad you're here. You want to see what I made?
00:20:23.055,00:20:24.473,Kitty ears!
00:20:24.640,00:20:26.642,I'm pretty great at making things.
00:20:27.351,00:20:30.062,"I bet you're great at making things, too."
00:20:30.270,00:20:33.440,Do you want me to show you how to make your own kitty ears?
00:20:34.233,00:20:36.193,Let's get crafting!
00:20:36.818,00:20:47.287,"OK, to make kitty ears, we need paper, pipe cleaners, scissors, a pencil, and your trusty glue stick."
00:20:47.537,00:20:50.040,The first thing you need is pipe cleaners.
00:20:50.499,00:20:53.418,I'm gonna pick these two sparkly ones.
00:20:53.710,00:20:56.546,You twist them together to make one long one.
00:20:57.506,00:20:58.548,Like this.
00:21:00.676,00:21:02.177,Let's make some ears.
00:21:02.469,00:21:05.097,I'm gonna use this sparkly purple paper.
00:21:05.264,00:21:07.557,Purple is my favorite color.
00:21:08.392,00:21:17.025,"So, fold your paper in half and put it down with the folded part at the bottom, and draw two triangle kitty ears."
00:21:17.776,00:21:21.571,"Then we cut them out, but don't cut the folded part."
00:21:21.822,00:21:22.864,Cutty-cutty!
00:21:26.201,00:21:30.289,"Now, let's attach the ears to our one long pipe cleaner."
00:21:31.540,00:21:35.585,Open one ear up and fold it around the pipe cleaner.
00:21:35.711,00:21:39.673,Use your trusty glue stick to glue the tops of the ears together.
00:21:41.300,00:21:43.468,Do the same thing with the other ear.
00:21:47.514,00:21:50.934,Let's use a different color to make the inside of the ears.
00:21:51.310,00:21:53.937,I'm gonna use this pink paper!
00:21:55.856,00:22:00.152,Cut out two smaller triangles for the inside of the kitty ears...
00:22:01.361,00:22:04.448,and glue them on top of the big kitty ears.
00:22:08.535,00:22:11.997,"Now, take the pipe cleaners and bend them into a circle."
00:22:12.873,00:22:14.833,Then twist the ends together.
00:22:15.500,00:22:17.711,There. It's like a little crown.
00:22:19.129,00:22:20.797,Kitty ears!
00:22:21.089,00:22:25.135,"Make your ears and you can be a Gabby Cat, too!"
00:22:25.719,00:22:27.971,I like making things with you.
00:22:28.055,00:22:29.348,See you soon!
00:22:31.600,00:22:34.519,"What do you think of the kitty ears I made? Pretty cute, huh?"
00:22:35.062,00:22:38.565,Come back soon and we'll open another Dollhouse surprise.
00:22:39.900,00:22:40.901,Bye!
00:00:48.089,00:00:51.509,Hey! I was just about to try a new hairstyle.
00:00:51.718,00:00:54.262,Sometimes I like to match my hair to my mood.
00:00:54.596,00:00:55.805,Like...
00:00:57.891,00:01:00.602,"silly hair, for when I need to laugh..."
00:01:03.396,00:01:07.317,"rainbow hair, for when I'm feeling colorful, or..."
00:01:09.319,00:01:14.199,"magical hair, like a unicorn, because everything's better with magic."
00:01:15.283,00:01:16.951,But today...
00:01:19.162,00:01:20.914,I'm going all me.
00:01:24.501,00:01:26.086,You know what that sound means.
00:01:26.169,00:01:28.880,It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery. Come on.
00:01:39.224,00:01:43.561,"Alright, let's see what we have inside of our Meow Meow Mailbox today."
00:01:45.814,00:01:49.901,Ooh! I love this box!
00:01:50.777,00:01:53.947,"Hey, it kind of looks like MerCat, doesn't it? Mm-hmm."
00:01:54.739,00:01:56.116,Let's see what's inside.
00:01:58.785,00:02:00.370,Whoa!
00:02:01.162,00:02:02.956,Two tiny tubes.
00:02:04.916,00:02:06.501,And one flask.
00:02:07.961,00:02:10.463,I wonder what we're supposed to do with these. Oh!
00:02:10.922,00:02:12.799,A-ha! Directions.
00:02:13.758,00:02:16.261,Looks like we're supposed to mix them. See?
00:02:16.511,00:02:19.264,The yellow and the blue liquid go in the beaker.
00:02:20.056,00:02:26.896,"But before we do that, like MerCat always says, safety before science."
00:02:27.188,00:02:28.189,Alright.
00:02:29.566,00:02:31.401,"First, we got to uncork it."
00:02:32.193,00:02:34.154,Boop and boop.
00:02:35.196,00:02:36.364,Let's see.
00:02:37.740,00:02:40.952,Whoa! The yellow and blue makes green!
00:02:43.079,00:02:44.497,Cool!
00:02:45.623,00:02:48.293,Whoa! That was so cool!
00:02:48.960,00:02:52.338,Wait a minute. Am I wearing a bathrobe?
00:02:55.758,00:02:57.010,I am!
00:02:58.052,00:02:59.387,There's something in here.
00:03:01.848,00:03:06.477,It's an invitation to MerCat's Spa Day Party in the Dollhouse.
00:03:06.769,00:03:09.063,Do you want to come to MerCat's party with me?
00:03:09.772,00:03:11.357,Yay! Let's go.
00:03:13.151,00:03:14.986,Aww! Pandy!
00:03:15.069,00:03:17.947,Look how cute you are in your little bathrobe.
00:03:19.282,00:03:21.910,Looks like MerCat's decorating for the party.
00:03:23.453,00:03:24.704,Let's get in there.
00:03:25.455,00:03:27.790,Time to get tiny.
00:03:37.008,00:03:38.593,Whee!
00:03:39.510,00:03:40.845,Come on in!
00:03:46.392,00:03:48.353,They're spa-tacular.
00:03:48.686,00:03:53.274,"But before the party starts, we have a Pandy cat to find."
00:03:54.734,00:03:56.361,Do you see Pandy?
00:03:59.197,00:04:00.490,Hug attack!
00:04:04.410,00:04:05.995,Spa Party!
00:04:06.704,00:04:07.914,Yippee!
00:04:10.208,00:04:11.251,"Hey, MerCat."
00:04:11.459,00:04:15.213,"Thanks for inviting us, and for the fluffy robes."
00:04:15.588,00:04:17.298,So soft!
00:04:23.805,00:04:28.351,"Cakey's making special face masks, and Baby Box and Mama Box are making super soaps."
00:04:31.396,00:04:34.274,Everybody's gonna be here soon. I've got to get ready.
00:04:34.607,00:04:38.027,-How can we help? -Could you finish blowing up the balloons?
00:04:38.361,00:04:41.114,Of course we can. I love balloons.
00:04:41.322,00:04:43.241,"Thanks, Pandy. Thanks, Gabby."
00:04:52.792,00:04:53.626,Whoopsie!
00:05:00.591,00:05:02.635,MerCat! Are you OK?
00:05:07.265,00:05:12.562,"Uh, MerCat, your color and sparkle, it's fading away."
00:05:13.229,00:05:14.230,What?
00:05:15.732,00:05:18.985,Uh-oh! This is my magical spot-removing potion.
00:05:19.068,00:05:23.614,"It's meant to fade away stains, but it looks like it's fading away my sparkle."
00:05:23.990,00:05:25.283,"I'm sorry, MerCat."
00:05:25.366,00:05:28.286,"Oh, Pandy, it's OK. It was just an accident."
00:05:28.661,00:05:31.205,But today is your Spa Day Party.
00:05:31.497,00:05:35.418,"It's the sparkliest, shiniest day of the whole year."
00:05:35.793,00:05:38.254,Ooh. That is true.
00:05:38.504,00:05:39.672,"Don't worry, Mercat."
00:05:39.756,00:05:43.092,We're gonna help you get your sparkle back in time for the party.
00:05:43.426,00:05:44.427,But how?
00:05:44.677,00:05:46.929,I don't know... yet.
00:05:47.180,00:05:48.765,But let's think about it.
00:05:48.848,00:05:51.893,Hey! Didn't you say Cakey was making face masks?
00:05:51.976,00:05:53.019,Maybe that will work.
00:05:53.102,00:05:57.565,Yeah! Maybe the face mask will bring back the sparkle in your face.
00:05:57.648,00:05:58.983,It's worth a try.
00:05:59.192,00:06:00.818,To the kitchen!
00:06:02.779,00:06:04.363,A berry for you.
00:06:05.823,00:06:07.742,Happy Spa Day Party!
00:06:11.913,00:06:16.667,We were hoping your special face masks might help MerCat get her color and sparkle back.
00:06:16.918,00:06:20.046,Sure! My face masks always do the trick.
00:06:20.129,00:06:21.172,Follow me!
00:06:24.300,00:06:25.134,Alright.
00:06:25.551,00:06:29.180,"We're gonna make my squishy, squeezy glow masks."
00:06:29.472,00:06:31.474,"Squishy, squeezy glow masks?"
00:06:31.557,00:06:33.726,Try saying that three times fast.
00:06:34.227,00:06:35.770,"Squishy, squeezy glow masks."
00:06:35.853,00:06:37.438,"Squishy, squeeby go max."
00:06:37.522,00:06:39.649,"Shushy, gleezy ghost max!"
00:06:39.732,00:06:41.192,Phew! Did I get it?
00:06:42.985,00:06:46.364,"Well, I don't care how you say it, as long as it works."
00:06:46.447,00:06:48.616,OK! Let's get squishing!
00:06:48.866,00:06:55.081,"For my squishy, squeezy glow masks we need avocado, lemon and honey."
00:06:55.164,00:06:58.417,"Let's give it a go. What do we do first, Cakey?"
00:06:59.335,00:07:02.964,The first thing we do is scoop out the avocado with a spoon.
00:07:13.224,00:07:15.351,"Now, here comes the fun part."
00:07:19.814,00:07:23.860,"Then we squeeze in a dash of lemon, and then a drop of honey."
00:07:24.360,00:07:27.572,Then mush and mash again!
00:07:28.614,00:07:30.408,"So, we..."
00:07:40.001,00:07:41.669,Mush and mash with us.
00:08:11.032,00:08:13.075,There! Now it's ready.
00:08:13.451,00:08:15.495,Whoa! This sure is messy.
00:08:17.914,00:08:18.956,"Hey, Pandy."
00:08:25.046,00:08:26.088,I hope this works.
00:08:26.172,00:08:27.965,Only one way to find out.
00:08:43.189,00:08:44.982,"You look silly, Gabby."
00:08:45.149,00:08:47.318,You look pretty silly yourself.
00:08:47.693,00:08:50.321,Now you leave it on for five seconds.
00:08:54.450,00:08:55.910,five!
00:08:56.077,00:08:57.703,Let's see the results.
00:09:03.834,00:09:05.545,"You're next, MerCat."
00:09:07.964,00:09:11.133,Then we'll keep looking until we find something that does work.
00:09:15.596,00:09:16.597,Did it work?
00:09:17.098,00:09:18.266,It did?
00:09:18.683,00:09:20.643,The face mask worked.
00:09:20.893,00:09:22.478,"Oh, shimmering sea scales!"
00:09:22.687,00:09:25.106,"You did it, Cakey! Thank you!"
00:09:29.443,00:09:32.989,"Well, now I just have to get the rest my sparkle back."
00:09:33.072,00:09:36.701,"Well, Baby Box and Mama Box are making soap for the party."
00:09:36.784,00:09:39.787,"-Maybe that could help. -Well, it's certainly worth a try."
00:09:39.870,00:09:41.455,Let's give it a go.
00:09:41.539,00:09:43.040,To the craft room!
00:09:44.333,00:09:47.211,"Thanks, Cakey. See you at the Spa Party."
00:09:47.295,00:09:49.380,I'm bringing smoothies.
00:09:51.841,00:09:52.925,"Oh, hey, Gabby."
00:09:55.052,00:09:57.680,MerCat? What happened?
00:09:57.763,00:10:00.391,I spilled a potion and she lost her sparkle.
00:10:00.600,00:10:04.937,"On Spa Day, the sparkliest, shiniest day of the whole year."
00:10:05.021,00:10:07.106,And we've just got to get it back.
00:10:08.357,00:10:10.526,"Don't worry, MerCat. We can help."
00:10:10.610,00:10:13.571,Let's use one of our colorful super soaps.
00:10:13.654,00:10:14.864,Want to make one?
00:10:15.281,00:10:17.533,"-You bet I do! -Me, too!"
00:10:17.617,00:10:20.328,Great! Let's get crafting!
00:10:20.411,00:10:21.412,How do we start?
00:10:21.495,00:10:25.750,First thing you do is pick what color you want your super soap to be.
00:10:25.958,00:10:27.918,You can put your colors in here.
00:10:28.127,00:10:30.338,I'm gonna pick...
00:10:30.630,00:10:31.631,yellow!
00:10:35.468,00:10:36.969,I want mine to be blue.
00:10:38.888,00:10:41.265,I'm gonna make my soap pink.
00:10:42.642,00:10:45.019,"What color do you want yours to be, MerCat?"
00:10:45.102,00:10:47.355,"I want my soap to be green, like me."
00:10:47.772,00:10:49.940,But I don't see any green.
00:10:50.024,00:10:51.067,Uh-oh.
00:10:54.362,00:10:58.240,And I know there are two colors we can mix together to make green.
00:10:58.324,00:11:00.493,One of them is definitely yellow.
00:11:02.119,00:11:05.831,"Now, what color do I mix with yellow to make green?"
00:11:12.672,00:11:15.174,Let's see what happens when we melt them together.
00:11:24.850,00:11:25.851,Wow!
00:11:25.935,00:11:28.104,Yellow and blue do make green.
00:11:28.646,00:11:30.398,It's MerCat green!
00:11:30.481,00:11:32.691,Science is cat-tastic.
00:11:32.900,00:11:36.570,Now we just need to pour these into the mold to shape our soaps.
00:11:38.531,00:11:42.284,"OK, Baby Box, what shape do you want your soap to be?"
00:11:42.576,00:11:47.164,Oh! I'm gonna pick the egg shape. It looks like a dinosaur egg.
00:11:53.170,00:11:55.297,-MerCat? -Ooh!
00:11:55.381,00:11:57.091,I'm gonna pick the kitty shape.
00:12:03.013,00:12:04.306,-Pandy? -Ooh!
00:12:04.390,00:12:06.517,I want mine to be shaped like an ice pop.
00:12:06.600,00:12:08.727,"Look, there's even a little stick."
00:12:15.151,00:12:16.485,"How about you, Gabby?"
00:12:16.569,00:12:18.154,I like the heart shape.
00:12:22.741,00:12:26.203,Now we get to pick out our super-special charms.
00:12:26.287,00:12:28.414,Super-special charms?
00:12:28.497,00:12:32.543,Yep. Charms are what make the super soaps super.
00:12:32.626,00:12:36.380,You need to pick something you love to put inside your soap.
00:12:36.464,00:12:40.759,"I love dinosaurs, so I'm going to pick a dinosaur."
00:12:43.846,00:12:46.557,"MerCat, do you see a charm that you love?"
00:12:46.640,00:12:49.393,Ooh! I see the perfect one for me.
00:12:50.186,00:12:52.313,Can you guess which charm is my favorite?
00:12:52.396,00:12:56.650,"OK, I'll give you a hint. It's something I wear every single day."
00:13:04.867,00:13:09.872,"Oh, I hope this makes my super soaps special enough to bring back my sparkle."
00:13:12.208,00:13:15.586,"I love hearts, so this is my special charm."
00:13:19.507,00:13:23.552,"And for my special charm, I'm gonna pick... the pickle."
00:13:23.761,00:13:25.387,The pickle?
00:13:25.471,00:13:27.973,"Yeah, because it's silly, like me."
00:13:31.560,00:13:33.312,And a moment in the fridge.
00:13:42.404,00:13:44.073,Super soaps are ready!
00:13:44.156,00:13:45.407,"Oh, yeah!"
00:13:45.491,00:13:48.536,Ta-da! Dinosaur egg!
00:13:49.411,00:13:52.540,Ooh! Check out my delicious pickle ice pop.
00:13:52.623,00:13:54.583,Pickle ice pop. Pickle ice pop.
00:13:56.919,00:13:59.713,I heart this so much.
00:14:05.052,00:14:08.430,Your super soap is super-duper special.
00:14:08.514,00:14:10.182,Are you ready to give it a try?
00:14:17.022,00:14:18.107,Is it working?
00:14:22.486,00:14:24.071,Your color's coming back!
00:14:24.154,00:14:25.489,"Great job, everyone."
00:14:25.573,00:14:27.283,-Wahoo! -Yahoo!
00:14:29.869,00:14:33.831,Bleugh! What's wrong with this ice pop? It tastes terrible.
00:14:35.291,00:14:37.877,It's not a real pickle ice pop.
00:14:37.960,00:14:39.753,It's made out of soap.
00:14:42.256,00:14:45.634,Who makes a pickle ice pop out of soap? That's silly.
00:14:46.760,00:14:51.015,See you at the party. I hear Cakey's bringing smoothies. Mm!
00:14:54.226,00:14:56.645,Popping penguins! The Spa Party!
00:14:56.729,00:14:59.565,"It's almost time, and I still don't have my sparkle tail back."
00:14:59.648,00:15:00.983,"Ooh, but I have an idea."
00:15:01.275,00:15:03.569,To the bathroom!
00:15:03.652,00:15:04.862,"Thanks, Baby Box."
00:15:04.945,00:15:06.155,Good luck! Bye!
00:15:10.451,00:15:11.994,"What's your idea, MerCat?"
00:15:12.244,00:15:16.582,All mermaid cats keep one extra magical mermaid scale in a secret spot.
00:15:16.957,00:15:21.587,"If we can get my scale, I think I can use it to bring my magical sparkle tail back."
00:15:21.670,00:15:23.172,That's great! Where is it?
00:15:23.339,00:15:30.429,"With all the other magical mermaid scales, deep under the sea, in Mermaid-lantis."
00:15:30.512,00:15:32.473,"Alright, I'm going in!"
00:15:42.441,00:15:48.530,"If we play the secret color code on this shell chime, the scale will come up to us."
00:15:49.198,00:15:52.242,What are we waiting for? Tell me the code and I'll play.
00:15:52.493,00:15:55.287,"Well, that's the thing. I don't know the code."
00:15:55.371,00:15:57.873,But then how are we gonna get the scale?
00:15:58.082,00:16:00.250,The spinner will give us the code.
00:16:00.584,00:16:04.213,It will spin five times and land on each of these colors.
00:16:04.380,00:16:09.760,We have to remember the colors and play them in the right order.
00:16:09.843,00:16:13.847,Whoa! That's a lot of colors. How are we gonna remember them all?
00:16:18.477,00:16:24.233,"Each time the spinner lands on a color, we'll paint one of my fingernails that same color."
00:16:24.316,00:16:27.736,Then we'll have the code right at my fingertips.
00:16:31.949,00:16:35.577,"Now, we have to say, Spin, spinner, spin!"
00:16:35.786,00:16:37.538,"Come on, say it with us."
00:16:43.210,00:16:44.628,Got it. Pink.
00:16:58.684,00:17:00.436,Seaweed green.
00:17:08.444,00:17:09.653,Only one more to go.
00:17:16.869,00:17:19.663,Ooh! It's like a rainbow manicure.
00:17:23.834,00:17:26.128,Everyone's gonna be here any minute!
00:17:29.173,00:17:30.841,Help me play the chimes.
00:17:31.216,00:17:33.594,What color do I play first?
00:17:35.429,00:17:36.430,Pink.
00:17:39.058,00:17:40.642,What color is next?
00:17:43.395,00:17:44.271,Blue.
00:17:46.732,00:17:48.484,What color comes next?
00:17:52.112,00:17:52.988,Green.
00:17:55.199,00:17:56.450,Next color?
00:17:59.119,00:17:59.953,Yellow.
00:18:02.456,00:18:04.833,What's the last color?
00:18:07.377,00:18:08.670,Orange.
00:18:20.766,00:18:24.520,Arthur! You made it! Did you bring my tail scale?
00:18:27.564,00:18:31.902,"Oh, thank you! Thank you! Hopefully this will bring my sparkle back."
00:18:33.320,00:18:34.863,"Come on, tail scale!"
00:18:43.705,00:18:45.874,"-Hey, MerCat. -Yeah! Spa Party!"
00:18:45.958,00:18:47.084,We're here.
00:18:47.167,00:18:48.335,Where's MerCat?
00:18:51.380,00:18:52.631,"Um, right here."
00:18:53.048,00:18:54.133,Did it work?
00:18:54.341,00:18:55.968,Did you get your sparkle back?
00:18:56.051,00:18:59.304,I guess there's only one way to find out. Fins crossed.
00:19:08.272,00:19:09.356,-Yes! -Awesome!
00:19:09.439,00:19:10.941,So sparkly!
00:19:13.193,00:19:16.280,It just would not be a Spa Day without my sparkle.
00:19:16.363,00:19:18.782,You look sparkle-tastic.
00:19:22.703,00:19:26.373,"Oh, thank you, Arthur. Now, you get this back home safe, OK?"
00:19:33.714,00:19:34.882,"Hit it, Catnip!"
00:19:38.468,00:19:42.139,"Mama, check it out! I used your favorite colors."
00:19:42.639,00:19:45.767,"Orange, green, and purple."
00:19:46.685,00:19:47.936,I love it.
00:19:53.483,00:19:56.653,"Cakey, do I detect a bit of mango in here?"
00:20:08.123,00:20:10.292,Ta-da! What do you think?
00:20:10.459,00:20:11.752,"Oh, MerCat!"
00:20:11.835,00:20:14.880,I love it. It's so sparkly.
00:20:15.214,00:20:16.715,Of course it is.
00:20:16.798,00:20:18.842,It is Spa Party Day...
00:20:22.054,00:20:24.890,Thanks for helping us get MerCat's sparkle back.
00:20:25.182,00:20:27.517,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:20:42.366,00:20:43.784,"It's me, MerCat."
00:20:46.495,00:20:51.083,"MerCat in the house, about to drop some Spa Science."
00:20:51.333,00:20:52.334,Come on!
00:22:23.508,00:22:26.928,I can't wait to share more Spa Science with you. Bye!
00:22:29.389,00:22:32.225,MerCat sure knows how to throw a good party.
00:22:32.434,00:22:34.853,Thanks for playing in the Dollhouse with us today.
00:22:34.936,00:22:38.231,"See you next time, and we'll open another Dollhouse surprise."
00:22:38.315,00:22:39.274,Bye!
00:00:47.922,00:00:48.923,"Oh, hi."
00:00:49.257,00:00:53.762,"I'm looking for my Big Book of Cat-tastic Mistakes, but I can't find it anywhere."
00:00:54.137,00:00:58.641,"It's about this big, and it has black and white stripes, just like my shirt."
00:00:58.725,00:01:01.102,"Hey, maybe you can help me find it. Come on."
00:01:02.979,00:01:03.980,OK.
00:01:04.064,00:01:07.192,Do you see a book with black and white stripes?
00:01:07.692,00:01:10.862,It's got to be around here somewhere.
00:01:14.783,00:01:16.868,You found it! Thanks.
00:01:18.495,00:01:19.496,OK.
00:01:19.579,00:01:22.957,"So, this is my Big Book of Cat-tastic Mistakes."
00:01:23.249,00:01:27.962,"One day, I figured out that every time I made a mistake, I learned something new."
00:01:28.338,00:01:30.548,Some of my best mistakes are in here.
00:01:31.049,00:01:33.218,Oh! I remember this one.
00:01:33.593,00:01:37.430,"One day, I accidentally spilled paint on a fresh new page."
00:01:37.514,00:01:39.432,I was so upset that I just...
00:01:40.141,00:01:41.476,closed the book shut.
00:01:49.567,00:01:51.444,See what I'm saying about mistakes?
00:01:51.528,00:01:54.155,Making a mistake showed me a new way to make art.
00:01:56.449,00:02:00.578,You know what that sound means. It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery!
00:02:00.995,00:02:02.497,"Come on, Pandy. Let's go."
00:02:12.966,00:02:17.470,Alright. Let's see what surprise our Meow Meow Mailbox has for us today.
00:02:21.850,00:02:24.769,It's a superhero kitty-cat box!
00:02:30.233,00:02:31.651,Let's see what's inside.
00:02:33.903,00:02:35.196,Ooh!
00:02:37.907,00:02:39.284,And capes!
00:02:39.868,00:02:41.911,It's a superhero costume!
00:02:45.832,00:02:47.542,And I'm Super Gabby.
00:02:50.712,00:02:52.297,There's something else in here.
00:02:59.929,00:03:04.392,"We're the Dollhouse Defenders, and we'll save the Dollhouse from the villain."
00:03:04.726,00:03:08.104,Hmm. I wonder who our villain is. OK...
00:03:10.982,00:03:13.359,I bet he's causing some trouble in the Dollhouse.
00:03:13.693,00:03:15.695,We'd better get in there and help out.
00:03:18.323,00:03:19.324,Come on.
00:03:23.202,00:03:25.204,Time to get tiny!
00:03:36.007,00:03:37.175,Come on in!
00:03:38.885,00:03:41.512,Welcome to the Dollhouse!
00:03:41.596,00:03:46.392,My Super Gabby sense tells me that Super Pandy is around here somewhere.
00:03:47.685,00:03:49.062,Do you see Pandy?
00:04:02.367,00:04:04.327,Super Paw Bump!
00:04:04.410,00:04:05.578,"I got you, Pandy."
00:04:09.082,00:04:11.459,"Super cookies, coming through!"
00:04:11.542,00:04:13.294,Super cookies?
00:04:13.378,00:04:15.838,"Wow, Cakey! You're a super baker."
00:04:15.922,00:04:18.091,"It's true, I am! See?"
00:04:18.424,00:04:21.678,There's Super Gabby... and Super Pandy.
00:04:23.638,00:04:26.683,And check out Kitty Fairy... and DJ Catnip.
00:04:30.144,00:04:32.355,You make the cutest hero ever.
00:04:34.732,00:04:38.194,I even made one for CatRat the Bad Guy.
00:04:39.529,00:04:42.907,One? Only one cookie for me?
00:04:47.120,00:04:48.496,I'll set the timer.
00:04:52.250,00:04:53.251,A-ha!
00:04:56.170,00:04:59.007,"That's right, it's me!"
00:04:59.090,00:05:00.967,And I want the cookies.
00:05:01.050,00:05:02.885,All the cookies!
00:05:03.052,00:05:05.138,But I made them for all the Gabby Cats.
00:05:05.388,00:05:06.431,Huh.
00:05:09.767,00:05:14.897,"they won't be able to come and eat the cookies, which means the cookies will be miney!"
00:05:15.315,00:05:18.443,"You're not capturing anyone, CatRat."
00:05:18.526,00:05:21.487,"Yeah! Gabby and I will stop you, because we're..."
00:05:26.242,00:05:27.577,"Oh, really?"
00:05:29.579,00:05:32.915,Let's see if you can stop my Cat Blaster.
00:05:33.374,00:05:38.046,I'll switch the dial on my Cat Blaster to my Hide-and-Seek Ray.
00:05:49.348,00:05:52.226,"I can hear you, but I can't see you."
00:05:52.935,00:05:55.813,Cakey's inside his Book of Tasty Treats.
00:05:55.897,00:05:59.275,Sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.
00:06:01.778,00:06:03.196,Toodley-doo!
00:06:06.199,00:06:09.160,I'm stuck inside with all these tasty treats!
00:06:09.702,00:06:11.412,Maybe we can shake him out.
00:06:11.829,00:06:12.872,"Come on, Cakey!"
00:06:15.958,00:06:17.251,"Well, that didn't work."
00:06:17.335,00:06:20.505,-How are we gonna get him out of there? -We need more information.
00:06:20.588,00:06:22.173,"Cakey, what do you see?"
00:06:23.591,00:06:25.593,I'm behind a frozen fruit pop.
00:06:27.929,00:06:30.098,Ooh! I found the frozen fruit pops.
00:06:30.473,00:06:33.059,"Cakey, which fruit pop are you behind?"
00:06:37.105,00:06:39.357,OK. Help us look for Cakey.
00:06:39.816,00:06:42.527,"Where's the pink, star-shaped fruit pop?"
00:06:52.745,00:06:53.746,Right there!
00:06:57.583,00:07:00.670,"Uh-oh! Cakey? Where did you go, buddy?"
00:07:03.464,00:07:05.800,"OK, Cakey, what are you behind now?"
00:07:09.011,00:07:10.054,Help us look.
00:07:10.680,00:07:13.683,Where's the blue donut with colored sprinkles?
00:07:20.606,00:07:21.649,There it is!
00:07:26.612,00:07:29.198,Uh-oh! He zapped to the next page again.
00:07:30.616,00:07:31.617,Whoa!
00:07:31.951,00:07:34.412,Look at all those delicious smoothies.
00:07:34.704,00:07:36.414,"What are you behind now, Cakey?"
00:07:39.750,00:07:41.419,with an orange umbrella.
00:07:42.712,00:07:44.046,"Alright, help us look."
00:07:44.213,00:07:47.884,Where's the pink and green smoothie with the orange umbrella?
00:07:57.518,00:07:58.519,There it is!
00:07:59.812,00:08:02.023,Yay! You found me!
00:08:02.315,00:08:04.734,"Pandy, quick! Let's get him out of there!"
00:08:04.817,00:08:05.818,On it!
00:08:05.902,00:08:08.529,I'll get you out of there before you zap away again.
00:08:08.613,00:08:09.989,"Grab on, Cakey."
00:08:11.449,00:08:12.658,Here we go.
00:08:16.537,00:08:18.080,You saved me!
00:08:18.164,00:08:20.458,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
00:08:20.917,00:08:22.960,Sprinkle party!
00:08:23.461,00:08:25.379,"We're so glad you're safe, Cakey."
00:08:25.463,00:08:26.714,Wow!
00:08:26.797,00:08:29.467,"You guys are like real, true heroes."
00:08:30.885,00:08:32.094,Oh! What was that?
00:08:32.970,00:08:34.305,The comic book!
00:08:35.181,00:08:38.309,Check it out. We're all in the comic book now.
00:08:38.809,00:08:40.311,That's super sweet!
00:08:44.315,00:08:46.526,That sounds like DJ Catnip.
00:08:46.609,00:08:48.319,CatRat must be at it again!
00:08:48.528,00:08:50.446,Dollhouse Defenders...
00:08:51.322,00:08:53.449,to the music room!
00:08:53.574,00:08:54.450,Good luck!
00:08:55.076,00:09:02.542,"Sorry, DJ Catnip, but with you out of the way I'll be one cookie closer to having them all to myself."
00:09:04.293,00:09:06.420,"Stop right there, CatRat!"
00:09:06.504,00:09:10.925,"Ah, you're just in time, Dollhouse Defenders."
00:09:19.934,00:09:23.813,Looks like this one will have you tied up for a while.
00:09:26.274,00:09:27.692,Toodley-doo!
00:09:33.781,00:09:35.908,"How will we get him out of there, Super Gabby?"
00:09:36.284,00:09:39.954,I don't know... yet. But let's see if this works.
00:09:40.204,00:09:42.290,"Don't worry, DJ Catnip!"
00:09:42.373,00:09:46.419,"With my super strength, I'll have you free in no time."
00:09:48.004,00:09:49.171,"Go, Gabby!"
00:09:55.636,00:09:57.972,Whoa! Did you see that?
00:09:58.431,00:10:03.519,"When the red tambourines played, the red bungee cords popped right off."
00:10:03.728,00:10:07.523,Wow. Hey... I'll try playing that blue drum.
00:10:16.782,00:10:17.992,It worked!
00:10:18.159,00:10:21.621,"Nice! Way to play that tune, Pandy!"
00:10:22.079,00:10:27.293,"So, if we play a colored instrument, it makes the same color cord pop off."
00:10:27.501,00:10:31.339,"Ha-ha! Alright, now. Keep playing those beats, guys!"
00:10:34.050,00:10:36.218,Let's do the green ones next.
00:10:36.469,00:10:41.515,"OK, we need a green instrument. Where do you see a green instrument?"
00:10:54.570,00:10:58.115,"Ooh-wee! Way to play that tune, Gabby!"
00:11:00.034,00:11:02.620,"Now, let's get rid of these yellow cords."
00:11:03.245,00:11:05.206,Do you see a yellow instrument?
00:11:17.760,00:11:19.678,"See you later, yellow cords."
00:11:24.141,00:11:25.309,Do you see one?
00:11:39.573,00:11:40.825,I'm almost free!
00:11:45.538,00:11:49.166,"I'm purple, and my instrument is my voice."
00:11:54.839,00:11:55.840,Whoo!
00:11:55.923,00:11:57.591,"-Oh, yeah! -Now, that's funky."
00:11:57.675,00:11:58.968,We did it!
00:11:59.135,00:12:00.928,"Thanks, Dollhouse Defenders!"
00:12:01.011,00:12:03.472,Nothing better than being rescued with a beat.
00:12:14.608,00:12:16.402,-Oh! -Ooh! The comic book!
00:12:18.696,00:12:19.697,Check it out.
00:12:19.780,00:12:22.783,Our DJ Catnip rescue is in the comic book now.
00:12:30.666,00:12:32.751,To the Fairy Tail Garden!
00:12:32.877,00:12:34.837,"Thanks for the rescue, kitty cats!"
00:12:36.088,00:12:39.592,"Nothing personal, Kitty Fairy, but this is about cookies."
00:12:42.136,00:12:45.806,Oh! My Float-Away Ray will work nicely.
00:12:56.192,00:12:58.777,"Don't worry, Kitty Fairy. We'll save you."
00:12:59.570,00:13:00.988,"Oh, yeah?"
00:13:01.405,00:13:05.326,"Good luck reaching her, after a blast from my Shrink Ray!"
00:13:13.334,00:13:15.002,"Oh, no, Super Gabby!"
00:13:15.085,00:13:18.214,We'll never reach Kitty Fairy now. We're too tiny!
00:13:18.714,00:13:22.760,"We may be mini, but we're still super mighty."
00:13:24.428,00:13:26.722,Ooh! I have an idea that might work.
00:13:26.805,00:13:27.806,Let's jump.
00:13:29.808,00:13:33.395,"Since we're so tiny, we can float right up to Kitty Fairy."
00:13:33.479,00:13:35.022,Paw-tastic!
00:13:35.105,00:13:36.440,"Hey, look!"
00:13:36.524,00:13:39.693,The bubble is getting bigger the higher we go.
00:13:40.611,00:13:42.154,Whoa!
00:13:42.571,00:13:44.740,Aww. That was a mistake.
00:13:45.115,00:13:50.955,"That was a mistake, but it taught me something about these bubbles that will help us get up to Kitty Fairy."
00:13:51.247,00:13:52.456,"Come on, jump!"
00:13:54.291,00:14:02.132,"These bubbles get bigger the higher they go, so we need to jump to a smaller bubble before this one gets too big and pops."
00:14:02.216,00:14:04.718,Let's find the smallest bubble and jump to it.
00:14:06.387,00:14:08.222,Which bubble is the smallest?
00:14:10.766,00:14:11.767,That one!
00:14:14.478,00:14:15.479,We did it!
00:14:15.980,00:14:18.274,Uh-oh! This one's getting big.
00:14:18.357,00:14:21.235,We'd better jump to a new bubble before it pops.
00:14:21.318,00:14:22.861,Help us find a new bubble.
00:14:24.238,00:14:26.365,Which bubble is the smallest?
00:14:27.950,00:14:29.618,That one! Jump!
00:14:37.751,00:14:39.587,"Bubble's getting pretty big, Gabby."
00:14:40.045,00:14:43.299,Quick! Which bubble is the smallest?
00:14:48.804,00:14:50.472,"Kitty Fairy, we're here!"
00:14:50.764,00:14:54.435,"Alright, on the count of three, let's jump to the branch."
00:14:54.518,00:14:55.644,Count with us.
00:15:01.734,00:15:03.736,Oh! Thank petunias!
00:15:03.819,00:15:04.904,You made it!
00:15:04.987,00:15:08.032,"Hang on, Kitty Fairy! We're gonna pop this bubble!"
00:15:08.282,00:15:11.285,It's not gonna be easy. These are some tough bubbles.
00:15:11.577,00:15:12.870,I'll give it a go.
00:15:18.500,00:15:19.668,It won't pop.
00:15:21.629,00:15:25.049,-That didn't work. -But we're not giving up. Hmm.
00:15:25.966,00:15:28.218,Maybe if we give it a big squeeze?
00:15:28.510,00:15:30.930,A big squeeze? Like a hug!
00:15:31.347,00:15:33.307,I know how to do that. Stand back.
00:15:34.475,00:15:37.728,Super Hug Attack!
00:15:46.070,00:15:47.571,You saved me!
00:15:47.655,00:15:49.698,"Thank you, Dollhouse Defenders!"
00:15:49.782,00:15:50.991,We're heroes!
00:15:53.035,00:15:54.203,It's what we do.
00:15:55.579,00:15:58.123,Hmm. How are we gonna go back down?
00:15:58.749,00:16:01.585,We'll fly down. That's what I do.
00:16:01.752,00:16:03.003,Hold hands.
00:16:04.213,00:16:05.965,Through the trees we go!
00:16:16.892,00:16:20.270,"Kitty Fairy, that was paw-tastic!"
00:16:20.354,00:16:23.649,Now I'll grow you back to normal size with a little...
00:16:24.525,00:16:26.151,garden magic!
00:16:30.948,00:16:32.116,It worked!
00:16:32.199,00:16:33.659,We didn't even get wet.
00:16:34.827,00:16:37.037,Ooh! Let's check out the new pages.
00:16:40.624,00:16:42.084,I'm in the comic book!
00:16:42.167,00:16:45.087,"And look, Pandy, you saved the day with a hug!"
00:16:45.421,00:16:47.089,"Yeah, I did!"
00:16:47.506,00:16:49.550,That must be my superpower!
00:16:50.050,00:16:52.177,The power of hugs!
00:16:52.553,00:16:54.096,"What's your power, Gabby?"
00:16:54.430,00:16:57.683,Huh. I don't know. Let me see.
00:16:58.767,00:17:02.646,"Well, in the kitchen, I tried shaking Cakey out of the book."
00:17:02.813,00:17:03.939,That didn't work.
00:17:04.023,00:17:08.777,"But I didn't give up, and we eventually freed Cakey from his Book of Tasty Treats."
00:17:09.486,00:17:15.284,"Then, in the music room, I tried to pull off the cords and ended up falling into the instrument tree."
00:17:15.451,00:17:18.370,But that mistake helped me figure out the solution.
00:17:20.914,00:17:26.378,"And then, in the garden, our first bubble popped and we fell right back to the ground."
00:17:30.299,00:17:32.551,all the way up to rescue Kitty Fairy.
00:17:32.968,00:17:33.969,Huh.
00:17:34.344,00:17:38.432,Every mistake I made led us to the idea that saved the day.
00:17:38.640,00:17:40.392,That must be my power!
00:17:40.476,00:17:44.021,The power of making mistakes. Paw bump!
00:17:50.194,00:17:53.697,"Come on, Super Gabby. We have cookies to save."
00:17:54.073,00:17:55.282,"Bye, Kitty Fairy."
00:17:55.908,00:17:57.785,"Thanks, Dollhouse Defenders!"
00:18:04.875,00:18:07.669,Cakey! How did you get out of that book?
00:18:10.047,00:18:11.715,"Oh, rats!"
00:18:11.799,00:18:15.761,"Well, you can eat your cookie, but the rest are all miney."
00:18:16.303,00:18:18.097,"No, they're not, CatRat!"
00:18:18.263,00:18:20.599,Super Gabby! Super Pandy!
00:18:23.143,00:18:27.189,Hmm. Looks like I'll have to find another solution for you.
00:18:37.658,00:18:39.409,I Shrink-Rayed myself!
00:18:39.576,00:18:41.787,"It's OK, CatRat. Have a cookie."
00:18:48.210,00:18:49.461,I smell cookies!
00:18:52.089,00:18:53.882,I'll never be able to eat all this!
00:18:54.174,00:18:56.051,I can grow you back to normal.
00:18:56.260,00:18:58.220,"Oh. Yes, please."
00:18:58.470,00:19:02.516,"But you have to promise, no more Bad Guy stuff."
00:19:02.599,00:19:05.561,"Oh, alright. As long as I get my cookie."
00:19:15.737,00:19:17.739,Here's to our heroes!
00:19:17.823,00:19:19.324,And to cookies!
00:19:19.825,00:19:21.160,I'll eat to that!
00:19:25.164,00:19:27.708,Thanks for all your super help today.
00:19:27.791,00:19:29.960,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:19:46.351,00:19:49.313,"It's me, Kitty Fairy!"
00:21:42.175,00:21:43.176,Mm!
00:22:11.330,00:22:14.791,Thanks for letting me share my garden magic with you. Bye!
00:22:19.004,00:22:20.547,Hi. Check this out.
00:22:20.630,00:22:24.760,I was just adding today's adventure into my Big Book of Cat-tastic Mistakes.
00:22:27.095,00:22:29.264,See what I mean about making mistakes?
00:22:29.348,00:22:33.560,"If I never made any of these mistakes, we never would have saved the Gabby Cats."
00:22:33.894,00:22:36.313,Making mistakes really is a superpower.
00:22:36.730,00:22:40.859,Come back next time and we'll make some more mistakes together. Bye!
00:00:48.173,00:00:51.760,"Meow, meow! Hi. I'm learning how to speak kitty-cat."
00:00:52.010,00:00:55.472,These cards can help teach us how to say words in cat language.
00:00:55.680,00:00:57.515,"This one says, Hello."
00:01:00.101,00:01:03.938,"And this one tells us how to say, It's time to eat."
00:01:15.241,00:01:18.620,Let's tell Floyd it's time to eat together. Say it with me.
00:01:18.703,00:01:20.080,Meow.
00:01:24.250,00:01:25.960,It worked! Good job.
00:01:28.213,00:01:30.965,"Hey, you know what that sound means."
00:01:31.049,00:01:33.676,It's a Dollhouse Delivery! Come on.
00:01:44.437,00:01:48.775,"All right, let's see what we have in our Meow Meow Mailbox today."
00:01:52.028,00:01:53.113,Look at this!
00:01:53.863,00:01:56.157,It's a little school bus!
00:01:56.324,00:02:00.203,See? There's wheels and the windows.
00:02:00.787,00:02:03.540,And it even has a little stop sign for the nose.
00:02:04.207,00:02:06.459,"OK, let's see what's inside."
00:02:09.129,00:02:10.130,Oh!
00:02:13.842,00:02:16.928,With the tiny little pink ears and the straps.
00:02:18.429,00:02:24.018,"And the little pocket with the polka dots, and the cute little kitty face."
00:02:24.352,00:02:26.062,Let's see if the zipper works.
00:02:27.021,00:02:29.941,Do you work? And what's inside of you?
00:02:30.525,00:02:32.235,Hmm. Let's see.
00:02:33.069,00:02:34.404,The zipper works.
00:02:35.905,00:02:37.323,It's a list!
00:02:37.949,00:02:47.584,"There's music time, story time, Wait a minute. These are all things you do in school."
00:02:50.128,00:02:52.881,We're going to play school in the Dollhouse today!
00:02:53.631,00:02:55.842,And not just any school.
00:02:56.175,00:02:57.510,Kitty School!
00:02:57.844,00:02:59.429,"Come on, let's go."
00:03:02.348,00:03:06.978,"I love learning new things, especially new kitty things."
00:03:07.061,00:03:09.147,Let's see where we're going to first.
00:03:09.397,00:03:11.149,What's first on our schedule?
00:03:13.276,00:03:14.944,Music time.
00:03:15.236,00:03:17.322,To the music room!
00:03:19.198,00:03:20.366,All right.
00:03:21.284,00:03:23.411,Time to get tiny.
00:03:32.503,00:03:34.255,Whee!
00:03:39.302,00:03:42.722,"OK, first things first, we have to find Pandy."
00:03:43.056,00:03:44.349,Help me look for him.
00:03:45.058,00:03:46.809,"Oh, Pandy Paws!"
00:03:48.811,00:03:49.729,Hug attack!
00:03:50.104,00:03:51.147,Whoa!
00:03:51.231,00:03:52.357,"Hi, Pandy."
00:03:52.690,00:03:54.734,"OK, cats and kittens."
00:03:57.278,00:03:59.906,Who's ready for Kitty School?
00:04:00.073,00:04:01.491,We can't wait!
00:04:01.574,00:04:04.160,DJ Catnip! Are you our music teacher?
00:04:05.787,00:04:07.121,Wiggly-wiggly-wig!
00:04:08.164,00:04:11.417,"All right, everybody gather around. It's music time!"
00:04:12.043,00:04:14.462,"Now, let me make sure everyone's here."
00:04:14.545,00:04:19.217,"In Kitty School, when I say your name, you say, Meow, meow!"
00:04:19.467,00:04:20.510,Gabby?
00:04:20.718,00:04:22.345,"Meow, meow!"
00:04:22.428,00:04:24.681,"-Pandy? -Meow, meow!"
00:04:24.973,00:04:26.307,"Now, how about you?"
00:04:26.391,00:04:28.810,Are you here and ready for music time?
00:04:29.936,00:04:32.397,"Let me hear you say, Meow, meow!"
00:04:34.816,00:04:37.235,Awesome!
00:04:37.652,00:04:38.528,CatRat?
00:04:40.446,00:04:41.739,CatRat?
00:04:43.366,00:04:45.827,Uh-oh. CatRat's late for class.
00:04:54.752,00:04:55.753,"Hey, CatRat."
00:04:56.129,00:04:57.088,CatRat?
00:04:57.171,00:05:00.466,"Meow, meow! Let's get this show on the road."
00:05:00.717,00:05:06.514,"All right, kitties, today we're going to sing one of my all-time favorite kitty tunes, All the Little Kitties."
00:05:06.723,00:05:08.433,I love this song!
00:05:14.355,00:05:17.734,It goes a little something like this.
00:05:24.324,00:05:25.742,Meow with us!
00:05:31.914,00:05:32.790,Yeah!
00:05:32.957,00:05:36.002,"Now, this time, we're gonna pounce, like this."
00:05:36.210,00:05:37.712,"Pounce, pounce."
00:05:46.095,00:05:47.096,Whoo!
00:05:47.263,00:05:51.100,"This time, all the little kitties go lick, lick, lick!"
00:05:51.184,00:05:53.352,"Like this. Lick, lick."
00:05:53.728,00:05:54.937,Lick with us.
00:06:04.280,00:06:07.116,"Whoo! Way to take us home, Gabby!"
00:06:07.325,00:06:10.578,I can tell you've been practicing your ukulele.
00:06:10.661,00:06:12.955,"-Wahoo! -Yeah, that was awesome."
00:06:13.039,00:06:15.374,"Gabby, let me see that class schedule."
00:06:25.968,00:06:28.221,Ooh! I love stickers.
00:06:29.347,00:06:31.224,Especially kitty stickers.
00:06:31.557,00:06:33.017,"OK, let's see."
00:06:33.184,00:06:36.729,"We had music time, so what time do we have next?"
00:06:39.607,00:06:40.775,Story time!
00:06:42.610,00:06:44.112,"Thanks, DJ Catnip."
00:06:44.195,00:06:45.947,"Anytime, kitty-cats."
00:06:51.160,00:06:52.411,"Bye, DJ Catnip!"
00:06:52.537,00:06:53.538,Come on!
00:06:56.415,00:06:58.960,"Cat-A-Vator, to the bedroom!"
00:07:07.176,00:07:09.720,"Hey, class. You ready for story time?"
00:07:09.971,00:07:10.847,We sure are.
00:07:11.973,00:07:13.391,This one's a classic.
00:07:13.683,00:07:15.685,The Three Little Pigs.
00:07:16.102,00:07:17.770,We can't wait to read it.
00:07:22.692,00:07:23.901,we play them!
00:07:30.074,00:07:31.284,Ooh! I do!
00:07:31.367,00:07:32.368,Me! Me!
00:07:37.373,00:07:41.377,"Wait, if you guys are The Three Little Pigs, who am I gonna play?"
00:07:41.544,00:07:43.546,You can be the Big Bad Wolf.
00:07:43.754,00:07:48.050,You want me to play the grumpy guy who's always knocking down the pigs' houses?
00:07:48.301,00:07:51.888,"-Well, if you don't want to, CatRat... -Are you kidding me?"
00:07:54.640,00:07:59.270,You know what? We should put our own Dollhouse twist on The Three Little Pigs.
00:07:59.520,00:08:00.938,I have an idea.
00:08:05.109,00:08:07.737,"Hi, Dress-Up Closet. May I come in?"
00:08:12.992,00:08:14.785,I'm Astronaut Pig!
00:08:19.207,00:08:20.208,Coming through.
00:08:22.627,00:08:25.254,Ta-da! It's Basketball Pig.
00:08:28.216,00:08:30.092,Let me see what I can be.
00:08:30.343,00:08:31.928,I'm coming in!
00:08:35.306,00:08:36.724,I'm Chef Pig.
00:08:41.938,00:08:44.023,Ooh! My turn! My turn!
00:08:44.315,00:08:46.984,Time for me to get my Big Bad Wolf on.
00:08:49.362,00:08:52.281,"Hey, there's no wolf costume in here."
00:08:52.448,00:08:55.618,"Oh, that's OK, CatRat. Just roll with it."
00:08:55.993,00:08:57.745,OK...
00:09:00.373,00:09:03.584,"Oh, well, that won't work. This is ridiculous!"
00:09:07.505,00:09:12.218,"Ha-ha! It's me, the Big Bad Chicken!"
00:09:12.510,00:09:16.847,"I'm gonna bawk and bawk, and peck your house in!"
00:09:17.014,00:09:18.766,Bawk! Bawk! Bawk!
00:09:18.849,00:09:20.351,Peck! Peck! Peck!
00:09:20.560,00:09:23.187,"-The Big Bad Chicken! -That's great, CatRat."
00:09:23.604,00:09:26.232,"Come on, let's all coodle up!"
00:09:28.442,00:09:32.613,Today we'll be playing The Three Little Pigs.
00:09:33.114,00:09:37.868,Ooh! You're gonna love this part. Close the rainbow curtains!
00:09:38.911,00:09:41.914,Let's go up into the story clouds!
00:09:42.206,00:09:46.335,"Once upon a time, there were Three Little Pigs."
00:09:46.711,00:09:52.133,"Basketball Pig, Chef Pig, and Astronaut Pig."
00:09:52.425,00:09:59.307,"Now, The Three Little Pigs were minding their own piggy business, when, all of a sudden, they heard..."
00:10:04.186,00:10:05.605,He's coming this way!
00:10:05.688,00:10:08.691,Quick! We'd better build a house so we can hide.
00:10:12.945,00:10:14.363,Basketballs.
00:10:17.867,00:10:18.701,Catch!
00:10:21.162,00:10:22.371,Behind-the-back move!
00:10:33.799,00:10:35.801,-We did it! -Wahoo!
00:10:37.136,00:10:38.763,"Quick, let's get inside!"
00:10:40.723,00:10:42.224,Bawk! Bawk! Bawk!
00:10:42.850,00:10:46.646,"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in. Bawk!"
00:10:47.146,00:10:50.316,"Not by the hair on our chinny, chin, chins!"
00:10:50.399,00:10:51.567,Say it with us.
00:10:55.404,00:11:00.326,"Then I'll bawk and I'll bawk, and I'll peck your house in!"
00:11:05.206,00:11:06.290,Let's get out of here!
00:11:06.499,00:11:07.875,"Oh, rats!"
00:11:11.128,00:11:12.129,Aww...
00:11:15.800,00:11:21.097,so Chef Pig started to build a house out of... pancakes!
00:11:23.265,00:11:26.143,Chef Pig began flipping pancakes.
00:11:26.268,00:11:27.436,"Here, catch!"
00:11:28.145,00:11:30.481,Got them! All right!
00:11:31.440,00:11:35.277,Oh! We can stick these together with a little butter for the mortar.
00:11:45.621,00:11:47.540,Voilà! It's done!
00:11:51.377,00:11:52.920,Bawk! Bawk! Bawk!
00:11:53.462,00:11:56.757,"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in."
00:11:57.133,00:11:58.175,Say it with us.
00:12:01.554,00:12:06.642,"Then I'll bawk and I'll bawk, and I'll peck your house in!"
00:12:11.105,00:12:12.398,Let's get out of here!
00:12:15.401,00:12:19.363,And the Big Bad Chicken had a tummy ache.
00:12:25.911,00:12:27.121,Moon rocks!
00:12:32.042,00:12:33.294,Let's get inside.
00:12:39.758,00:12:41.302,You know what we say.
00:12:44.847,00:12:46.474,All right.
00:12:46.557,00:12:53.814,"Then I'll bawk and I'll bawk, and I'll peck your house in!"
00:12:54.023,00:12:55.024,Bawk! Bawk!
00:12:57.401,00:12:59.278,"Oh, I give up!"
00:12:59.820,00:13:03.782,I promise I won't bawk or bawk or peck your house in any more.
00:13:07.912,00:13:09.747,Aww. Poor CatRat.
00:13:10.039,00:13:12.708,He did a great job being the Big Bad Chicken.
00:13:12.791,00:13:14.793,I think he deserves a little space treat.
00:13:15.586,00:13:16.754,Hold on a minute.
00:13:22.593,00:13:24.428,"Why, thank you! Mm."
00:13:24.512,00:13:25.763,"Peck. Peck, peck."
00:13:33.354,00:13:34.563,-Yeah! -Wahoo!
00:13:35.856,00:13:38.734,"Thanks, Pillow Cat. That was a cat-tastic story."
00:13:39.026,00:13:41.779,Thank you for playing little piggies with me.
00:13:43.697,00:13:48.786,"Oh, and CatRat, you were the best Big Bad Chicken I've ever seen."
00:13:52.623,00:13:53.791,Bawk! Bawk!
00:13:54.291,00:13:58.337,You guys definitely deserve a sticker for that story time.
00:14:01.048,00:14:03.300,"So, we finished story time."
00:14:03.467,00:14:04.760,Let's see what's next.
00:14:06.011,00:14:08.264,A ball and a whistle.
00:14:12.434,00:14:13.978,Playtime in the playroom!
00:14:14.061,00:14:16.564,"Carlita, here we come!"
00:14:20.317,00:14:21.569,"Bye, Pillow Cat."
00:14:21.777,00:14:22.778,Bye!
00:14:26.198,00:14:27.783,To the playroom!
00:14:41.171,00:14:42.464,"Hey, little kitties."
00:14:42.715,00:14:44.842,"Hey, Carlita, fender bump!"
00:14:46.218,00:14:48.137,We're ready for playtime.
00:14:48.512,00:14:51.765,-What are we playing today? -I don't know. I'm not the coach.
00:14:52.349,00:14:55.311,"Well, if you're not the coach, then who is?"
00:14:58.063,00:14:58.898,I am!
00:15:00.733,00:15:03.861,Coach CatRat here! Achaa!
00:15:04.236,00:15:06.238,"All right, class, line up."
00:15:08.949,00:15:13.370,"We're gonna play every kitty's favorite game, follow the kitty light!"
00:15:13.829,00:15:14.914,Kitty light!
00:15:15.831,00:15:16.916,I'm gonna get it!
00:15:17.583,00:15:18.584,"Come here, you!"
00:15:24.131,00:15:29.303,Follow the kitty light is a little like tag and a little like hide-and-seek.
00:15:29.678,00:15:33.766,"I'll hide, then you have to find the kitty light and follow it."
00:15:34.058,00:15:38.646,"If you keep following the light, you'll find... me!"
00:15:40.689,00:15:41.690,Toodles!
00:15:42.149,00:15:43.984,Let's go find that light!
00:15:46.278,00:15:48.739,OK. Do you see the kitty light?
00:15:54.536,00:15:55.871,It's on the rock wall.
00:15:55.955,00:15:57.539,"Beep, beep! Hop in."
00:16:04.213,00:16:05.047,Look.
00:16:05.965,00:16:07.257,There's the kitty light.
00:16:08.133,00:16:09.551,Let's get climbing.
00:16:28.946,00:16:30.489,"Go for it, Carlita!"
00:16:33.951,00:16:36.161,Vanishing valves! It's gone!
00:16:36.829,00:16:39.707,Let's look again. Where do you see the kitty light?
00:16:45.462,00:16:48.757,"Over there, at the end of the rope bridge. Let's go!"
00:16:56.515,00:16:58.475,Vroom! We got this!
00:17:00.019,00:17:01.186,I'll handle this.
00:17:02.688,00:17:03.689,Gotcha!
00:17:04.732,00:17:05.566,Hey!
00:17:06.025,00:17:07.234,CatRat.
00:17:07.609,00:17:09.194,We've got to follow that light.
00:17:09.611,00:17:11.822,Where did the kitty light go this time?
00:17:16.785,00:17:17.995,The ball pool!
00:17:18.078,00:17:18.996,Yes!
00:17:26.336,00:17:28.172,I love ball pools.
00:17:28.255,00:17:29.757,Cannonball!
00:17:29.840,00:17:30.883,Pandy-ball!
00:17:30.966,00:17:32.509,Carlita-ball!
00:17:34.303,00:17:35.304,I'll get it!
00:17:38.557,00:17:39.975,"Pandy, it's on your head!"
00:17:41.643,00:17:42.853,Aww...
00:17:43.228,00:17:45.355,"I'll catch you this time, kitty light."
00:17:49.818,00:17:50.694,CatRat!
00:17:51.570,00:17:53.030,You did it!
00:17:53.113,00:17:55.240,You found Coach CatRat!
00:17:56.366,00:17:58.118,That was so much fun!
00:17:58.202,00:17:59.787,"CatRat, we found you!"
00:17:59.870,00:18:01.163,You sure did.
00:18:01.330,00:18:03.874,And you earned a sticker!
00:18:07.544,00:18:10.923,"OK, kitties, what's the last time on our schedule?"
00:18:13.717,00:18:14.885,Lunchtime!
00:18:14.968,00:18:18.347,Yes! Lunchtime is my favorite time of day.
00:18:19.932,00:18:22.059,The Cat-A-Vator Bus is here.
00:18:27.356,00:18:31.860,"Since we're on our way to lunch, I think it's time for all the kitties to go..."
00:18:43.747,00:18:46.291,"Whoa, tummy! Do you want some food?"
00:18:47.626,00:18:49.086,I think she does.
00:18:49.211,00:18:51.463,"Well, perfect timing, tummy."
00:18:51.755,00:18:53.340,Kitty lunch is ready!
00:18:53.549,00:18:54.800,Yay!
00:18:54.883,00:18:56.176,What's for lunch?
00:18:56.385,00:18:59.638,"I made something special today for you, class."
00:19:01.265,00:19:03.100,Kitty pizzas!
00:19:05.686,00:19:07.563,"Those look delicious, Cakey."
00:19:07.813,00:19:09.815,-Thanks! -How did you make them?
00:19:12.693,00:19:15.988,then added sauce and fresh cheese.
00:19:22.953,00:19:26.665,"Red peppers for the whiskers, nose and mouth."
00:19:31.295,00:19:33.213,"Hey, we heard it was lunchtime."
00:19:34.590,00:19:36.967,Yep! There's some for everyone.
00:19:37.843,00:19:39.678,-Yummy! -Yay!
00:19:39.761,00:19:42.014,"Yummy, yummy, lunchtime!"
00:19:42.181,00:19:47.853,"And since this is Kitty School, everybody gets a saucer of milk with their pizza."
00:20:01.533,00:20:04.411,"Good eating, kittens. Here's your sticker."
00:20:04.995,00:20:07.915,We did it! We got all our stickers!
00:20:09.958,00:20:11.376,-Yay! -Yeah!
00:20:11.585,00:20:13.545,What a great day at Kitty School.
00:20:13.754,00:20:16.882,Thanks for playing with us. You're such a cute little kitty.
00:20:17.132,00:20:20.177,Oh! Are you ready for another surprise?
00:20:33.523,00:20:36.235,"It's me, DJ Catnip!"
00:22:28.555,00:22:29.514,"Hey, look!"
00:22:34.352,00:22:37.981,I had so much fun learning how to be a cat with you today.
00:22:38.607,00:22:40.317,"Meow, meow, meow! Bye!"
00:00:47.797,00:00:50.759,"Oh, hi! I mean, ahoy, matey!"
00:00:50.842,00:00:55.263,"Pandy and I are playing pirates, and I made us balloon swords."
00:00:55.847,00:00:59.517,"OK, Pandy, en garde!"
00:01:02.812,00:01:05.940,"Whoa! Oh, my goodness! Almost got me there."
00:01:12.530,00:01:16.159,You know what that sound means. It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery!
00:01:16.451,00:01:17.577,"Come on, Pandy."
00:01:28.254,00:01:29.756,"Alright, mateys!"
00:01:29.839,00:01:33.301,Let's see what we have in our Meow Meow Mailbox today.
00:01:37.013,00:01:39.516,Piratey. See? Look.
00:01:39.599,00:01:43.228,It has a little eyepatch and a bandanna. Let's see what's inside.
00:01:48.358,00:01:51.361,It's a bottle! And there's something inside.
00:01:51.569,00:01:53.780,Should we see what it is? Yeah.
00:01:55.657,00:01:58.409,Maybe it's a message? Hmm.
00:01:59.577,00:02:01.287,It's a treasure map!
00:02:01.704,00:02:06.209,"Look like if we follow this map from island to island, it will lead us to the X."
00:02:06.292,00:02:09.337,X marks the spot. That's where the treasure is buried.
00:02:12.507,00:02:14.259,Yarr! Come on.
00:02:16.928,00:02:19.139,"Alright, me hearties!"
00:02:20.431,00:02:22.892,Let's see where our treasure hunt begins.
00:02:24.102,00:02:27.480,"So, we start on the first island. And there's a paw print on it."
00:02:28.273,00:02:29.774,Whose paw print is that?
00:02:31.276,00:02:33.820,Whose paw print looks like this?
00:02:38.032,00:02:40.201,Yeah! DJ Catnip!
00:02:40.660,00:02:43.621,"First stop, Music Island!"
00:02:44.205,00:02:48.668,"Alright, mateys, 'tis time to get tiny."
00:02:59.971,00:03:02.515,What are you doing out there? Come on in!
00:03:04.225,00:03:06.311,Welcome to my Dollhouse.
00:03:16.613,00:03:20.241,"When you see Pandy, say, Ahoy!"
00:03:28.458,00:03:29.709,Ahoy!
00:03:30.209,00:03:31.794,Pirate hug attack!
00:03:34.005,00:03:34.839,Whoa!
00:03:36.674,00:03:39.427,"Yo-ho-ho, pirate kitties!"
00:03:39.510,00:03:41.429,"Ahoy, Pirate Catnip!"
00:03:41.512,00:03:44.807,"Hey, I hear you two are searching for pirate treasure."
00:03:46.684,00:03:48.311,I love pirate talk.
00:03:48.394,00:03:53.358,"Well, I'm thinking you'll be needing a pirate song to sing on your travels."
00:03:55.360,00:03:57.153,Yeah! I've got a good one.
00:03:57.237,00:03:59.864,And it goes a little something like this.
00:04:04.077,00:04:05.954,That's the pirate song.
00:04:06.204,00:04:08.581,Let's sing the pirate song together.
00:04:42.824,00:04:47.412,"Well, now y'all have a peppy pirate tune to sing on your proper pirate journey."
00:04:47.662,00:04:50.290,"OK, so, we have our pirate song."
00:04:50.373,00:04:52.959,Let's check the map to see where we go next.
00:04:54.252,00:04:56.212,We started on Music Island.
00:04:59.424,00:05:03.511,This island has a paw print with a rectangle and three squares.
00:05:05.013,00:05:09.434,Whose paw print has a rectangle and three squares?
00:05:13.813,00:05:15.064,Baby Box!
00:05:15.356,00:05:17.066,We're off to Craft Island!
00:05:17.150,00:05:19.861,"Arr! Come on, mateys!"
00:05:20.069,00:05:21.988,"Thanks, Pirate Catnip."
00:05:22.071,00:05:23.865,"Anytime, pirate kitties."
00:05:36.085,00:05:37.962,"Ahoy, pirates!"
00:05:40.381,00:05:42.967,Look. We're following the map to find the treasure.
00:05:43.718,00:05:47.680,"Well, then you'll be needing your very own pirate ship."
00:05:50.475,00:05:52.143,-Wahoo! -Alright!
00:05:52.435,00:05:55.146,"Alright, let's do it!"
00:06:10.578,00:06:11.704,Ah.
00:06:14.916,00:06:16.834,Cat-tastic!
00:06:16.918,00:06:19.128,You got to be kitten me!
00:06:19.212,00:06:22.715,Your pirate ship isn't done yet. It still needs a sail.
00:06:22.799,00:06:25.635,To the corkboard!
00:06:29.680,00:06:32.225,We'll use this as our guide to make our sail.
00:06:32.475,00:06:34.018,Let's build it together.
00:06:36.813,00:06:39.857,"First, we need to find the bottom of the boat."
00:06:39.941,00:06:42.151,It's a half-circle with stripes on it.
00:06:53.746,00:06:57.500,A few dabs of me trusty glue...
00:07:01.838,00:07:02.672,There!
00:07:03.256,00:07:06.884,Now we need the square with the boat anchors.
00:07:14.475,00:07:15.476,We found it!
00:07:23.025,00:07:25.278,There! Almost done.
00:07:30.741,00:07:32.577,Help us find the triangle sail.
00:07:33.119,00:07:35.872,Uh-oh. They're all triangles.
00:07:36.038,00:07:38.291,But which one has polka dots on it?
00:07:41.627,00:07:42.462,Right there!
00:07:44.589,00:07:46.132,We got the last piece!
00:07:50.678,00:07:53.764,Now we have a pirate sail for our pirate ship.
00:07:54.098,00:07:55.933,Like proper pirates.
00:07:56.017,00:07:57.185,Yarr!
00:08:01.397,00:08:04.567,Our pirate ship is finished!
00:08:04.650,00:08:05.860,Not yet.
00:08:08.488,00:08:12.325,"You need a plank, because they're fun to jump off of."
00:08:13.951,00:08:15.411,Whee!
00:08:19.874,00:08:21.792,"Thanks, Pirate Baby Box!"
00:08:21.876,00:08:25.421,"Yarr! 'Twas my pleasure, Pirate Gabby."
00:08:25.505,00:08:29.425,"Now that we have a ship, let's go get that treasure!"
00:08:30.218,00:08:32.762,Let's find out which island we're going to next.
00:08:38.226,00:08:40.978,This paw print has a seashell shape in it.
00:08:42.104,00:08:44.857,Whose paw print has a seashell shape?
00:08:48.861,00:08:49.946,MerCat!
00:08:50.988,00:08:54.200,"Next stop, Bathroom Island!"
00:08:54.617,00:08:56.410,"Come on, Pirate Pandy."
00:08:56.494,00:08:59.288,'Tis time to sail the seven seas.
00:09:03.960,00:09:07.630,"Thanks for building us this craft-tastic ship, Baby Box."
00:09:07.880,00:09:10.508,"'Twas me pleasure, Pirate Gabby."
00:09:10.591,00:09:13.052,Happy sailing to you both.
00:09:28.359,00:09:29.777,"Ahoy, MerCat!"
00:09:29.860,00:09:31.696,"Ahoy, Pirate Gabby!"
00:09:31.779,00:09:33.531,"Ahoy, Pirate Pandy!"
00:09:33.739,00:09:38.327,"Ooh! That's a fine, seaworthy ship for a pirate treasure hunt."
00:09:38.494,00:09:39.328,Thanks.
00:09:39.412,00:09:41.372,Our treasure map brought us here.
00:09:41.455,00:09:44.750,Aye! I've got something very important for you.
00:09:47.461,00:09:50.881,"When you find your pirate treasure, you're going to need..."
00:09:52.550,00:09:53.718,a key!
00:09:53.801,00:09:56.971,A key to open the treasure chest. Which one do we need?
00:09:57.054,00:09:58.556,The shiny one.
00:10:03.644,00:10:04.604,Ah.
00:10:08.983,00:10:13.613,One spray of my Song of the Sea potion will reveal your shiny key.
00:10:13.863,00:10:16.198,"Oh, this is paw-tastic!"
00:10:16.282,00:10:21.996,"First, give the bottles a spray, and then listen closely for the sound of crashing waves and seagulls."
00:10:22.079,00:10:23.998,That's the Song of the Sea potion.
00:10:24.081,00:10:28.044,Alright. We need to find the potion that sounds like the ocean.
00:10:28.294,00:10:29.712,"Hey, that rhymes!"
00:10:30.338,00:10:33.758,"OK, does this sound like crashing waves and seagulls?"
00:10:37.928,00:10:38.846,Nope.
00:10:38.929,00:10:41.766,Oh! That's my Song of the Jungle potion.
00:10:42.058,00:10:43.434,Let's try the next one.
00:10:44.560,00:10:47.271,Does this sound like crashing waves and seagulls?
00:10:51.984,00:10:53.319,Definitely not.
00:10:53.569,00:10:56.405,That's my Song of the City potion.
00:10:56.489,00:10:58.324,Try the next one! Try the next one!
00:11:07.041,00:11:08.084,Yes!
00:11:08.167,00:11:10.711,That's it! That's the Song of the Sea potion!
00:11:16.425,00:11:18.427,"Now, let's find your key."
00:11:26.060,00:11:27.395,That's our key!
00:11:27.603,00:11:29.522,Ooh! It's so shiny.
00:11:43.119,00:11:44.245,Yar-har!
00:11:44.328,00:11:46.831,"That key, 'tis super shiny."
00:11:46.997,00:11:51.085,"But remember, shiny is miney."
00:11:58.217,00:11:59.301,Thanks.
00:11:59.718,00:12:03.180,Yo-ho-ho and a toodley-doo!
00:12:08.853,00:12:10.855,No! He took our key!
00:12:11.063,00:12:13.399,Now we'll never be able to open the treasure.
00:12:13.774,00:12:16.944,"Come on, Pandy. Pirates never give up."
00:12:20.114,00:12:22.533,We just need to figure out how to get the key back.
00:12:26.287,00:12:27.538,Then hop in.
00:12:29.290,00:12:32.460,Follow CatRat the Pi-Rat to Pirate Island!
00:12:45.890,00:12:47.641,You got to be kitten me!
00:12:47.725,00:12:50.311,This is the best pirate adventure ever!
00:13:14.752,00:13:18.589,"Pirate Pandy, any sign of CatRat the Pi-Rat up there?"
00:13:20.257,00:13:21.342,Help me look.
00:13:22.885,00:13:26.680,"When you see Pirate Island, say, Ahoy!"
00:13:31.018,00:13:32.186,Ahoy!
00:13:32.770,00:13:35.397,CatRat the Pi-Rat must be on that island.
00:13:36.398,00:13:37.733,Straight ahead!
00:13:38.817,00:13:39.944,"Great work, pirates."
00:13:45.157,00:13:46.283,Full speed ahead!
00:13:46.617,00:13:48.035,To the island!
00:13:48.702,00:13:50.663,We'll have that key in no time.
00:13:58.879,00:14:01.674,And we need wind in our sails to reach the island.
00:14:01.757,00:14:02.967,Leave that to me.
00:14:04.385,00:14:07.429,Wind hair!
00:14:07.680,00:14:11.642,My curls and swirls of wind will get us moving again.
00:14:24.613,00:14:29.410,I'll stay on board to make sure that sneaky CatRat the Pi-Rat doesn't try anything fishy.
00:14:29.493,00:14:30.828,"Great thinking, MerCat."
00:14:32.705,00:14:34.915,-Whee! -Pandabunga!
00:14:45.426,00:14:46.427,What?
00:14:53.976,00:14:55.811,Where did that log come from?
00:14:55.895,00:14:58.731,"You're wasting your time, pirates."
00:14:58.814,00:15:01.066,You'll never get this key back.
00:15:03.068,00:15:04.820,"What? No, they won't."
00:15:05.029,00:15:06.947,"Hey, you're on my side!"
00:15:13.913,00:15:15.497,Have some more logs!
00:15:17.791,00:15:20.586,"When you see a log coming, yell, Jump!"
00:15:40.481,00:15:43.108,"Whoo! Thanks for your help, pirates."
00:15:48.197,00:15:52.201,You're gonna need more than a few logs to stop Pirate Pandy and me.
00:15:55.704,00:15:57.164,But it's my key.
00:16:00.584,00:16:03.504,"Well, sure, b-but... can you blame me?"
00:16:03.587,00:16:06.173,It be so shiny. Look at it!
00:16:06.548,00:16:08.842,We need that key to open the treasure.
00:16:09.051,00:16:12.096,Ooh! Treasure? Is it shiny?
00:16:12.304,00:16:16.183,"We don't know, CatRat, but we promise to share it with you when we find it."
00:16:16.266,00:16:18.852,"Well... OK, then."
00:16:18.936,00:16:20.229,Here you go.
00:16:20.604,00:16:21.772,"Thanks, CatRat."
00:16:35.828,00:16:37.079,We got the key!
00:16:37.162,00:16:38.789,Yes! I knew you would.
00:16:38.872,00:16:42.167,OK. Let's check the map to see where we're going next.
00:16:45.212,00:16:47.214,This is the last island!
00:16:47.297,00:16:49.174,That's where the treasure is.
00:16:51.802,00:16:53.971,This paw print has a flower shape in it.
00:16:54.805,00:16:56.807,Whose paw print has a flower shape?
00:17:01.770,00:17:02.980,Kitty Fairy!
00:17:03.313,00:17:06.066,The treasure's buried on Fairy Island!
00:17:08.944,00:17:11.238,Let's go. We got to get there fast!
00:17:11.321,00:17:15.075,Good thing I know a shortcut. Let me grab my travel bubbles.
00:17:20.998,00:17:23.000,Off to Fairy Island!
00:17:34.970,00:17:36.722,That was a-meow-zing!
00:17:37.556,00:17:39.016,"Welcome, me hearties!"
00:17:39.266,00:17:40.350,Arr!
00:17:40.434,00:17:43.145,Kitty Fairy! We came for the treasure.
00:17:43.228,00:17:44.938,We have the key.
00:17:45.147,00:17:46.774,"Oh, wait. Wrong thing."
00:17:48.358,00:17:49.359,Ta-da!
00:17:50.152,00:17:52.237,Ooh! It's so shiny!
00:17:52.321,00:17:56.241,"-Where's the treasure buried? -Well, only the Pirate Flower knows that."
00:17:58.160,00:18:00.871,We have to wake it up with the kitty pirate song.
00:18:01.163,00:18:04.083,The kitty pirate song! Sing it with us.
00:18:15.803,00:18:19.681,"Hi, Pirate Flower. We're looking for the buried treasure."
00:18:19.848,00:18:21.975,Ooh! Arr!
00:18:22.142,00:18:27.815,"Legend has it, the Fairy Island treasure is buried beneath a fairy house."
00:18:27.898,00:18:31.485,"Well, all the fairy houses are over there. Follow me."
00:18:33.904,00:18:37.116,Oh! Which fairy house is the treasure buried under?
00:18:37.741,00:18:41.036,I know it's underneath a yellow fairy house.
00:18:48.669,00:18:50.212,The one in the middle!
00:18:50.420,00:18:51.880,"What else, Pirate Flower?"
00:18:52.214,00:18:57.136,I know the treasure is buried beneath a fairy house with a green door.
00:19:06.145,00:19:08.647,-Hmm. But there's no X. -Hang on.
00:19:12.734,00:19:13.735,The X!
00:19:14.069,00:19:16.363,-Wahoo! -Yeah!
00:19:19.741,00:19:21.535,This is the treasure chest!
00:19:26.623,00:19:28.250,"Quick, Pandy, use the key."
00:19:28.834,00:19:30.002,Here we go.
00:19:51.190,00:19:54.401,It's a pirate party! That's our treasure.
00:19:54.693,00:19:56.612,Who wants a coconut smoothie?
00:20:01.116,00:20:06.413,Yo-ho-ho! It's not a party until the CatRat gets here.
00:20:06.747,00:20:09.625,"-Hey, CatRat. -How about a coconut smoothie?"
00:20:09.708,00:20:10.792,My favorite!
00:20:12.252,00:20:13.962,"Ah, delicious."
00:20:14.129,00:20:16.632,Let's pirate-party!
00:20:31.438,00:20:33.941,You sure are a great pirate.
00:20:34.024,00:20:36.485,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:20:52.042,00:20:54.586,"It's me, Cakey!"
00:20:57.214,00:20:59.716,Hi! Today I'm gonna show you how to make...
00:21:03.720,00:21:06.556,They're delicious and piratey!
00:21:08.517,00:21:11.186,OK. First thing you need is...
00:21:12.938,00:21:15.482,"one fluffy, yummy pancake."
00:21:15.691,00:21:17.651,This will be the pirate head.
00:21:18.318,00:21:20.946,Let's make a strap for the pirate eyepatch.
00:21:21.113,00:21:23.240,We'll use some yummy raisins.
00:21:24.074,00:21:28.078,"Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop."
00:21:28.161,00:21:29.288,Yummy!
00:21:29.371,00:21:32.374,Now add a slice of plum for the eyepatch.
00:21:33.125,00:21:34.876,"There we go, Mr. Pirate."
00:21:35.669,00:21:39.047,Now some bananas and blueberries.
00:21:39.131,00:21:43.677,I use a slice of banana with a little-bitty blueberry on it for the eye.
00:21:44.219,00:21:48.348,Now let's give our pirate a nice big banana smile.
00:21:51.143,00:21:56.106,"And of course, no pirate is complete without a bandanna for their head."
00:21:56.440,00:21:58.191,Strawberries!
00:22:01.403,00:22:06.825,I like to use a bunch of strawberry slices to shape the bandanna and give it that little swoop at the back.
00:22:07.200,00:22:08.243,All done!
00:22:08.618,00:22:09.953,Arr!
00:22:10.037,00:22:12.289,One delicious pancake pirate.
00:22:12.372,00:22:13.832,Mm-mm!
00:22:14.124,00:22:15.292,Too much yummy.
00:22:18.503,00:22:21.089,Come back soon and Bakey with Cakey again.
00:22:21.465,00:22:22.549,Bye!
00:22:28.430,00:22:32.601,Come back next time for another cat-tastic adventure in me Dollhouse.
00:22:33.143,00:22:35.187,Shiver me timbers! That was fun!
00:22:35.687,00:22:38.857,"Until then, stay piratey, mateys."
00:00:49.591,00:00:52.051,I'm Gabby Girl's best stuffed animal friend.
00:00:52.719,00:00:54.345,"Who's Gabby, you ask?"
00:00:55.180,00:00:57.307,I am! I'm Gabby.
00:00:57.599,00:01:00.351,"Thanks for the introduction, Pandy Paws. Paw bump?"
00:01:03.855,00:01:05.648,"There you go, Pandy."
00:01:06.691,00:01:08.109,Welcome to my room.
00:01:08.193,00:01:11.196,I'm so glad you're here! Let me show you around.
00:01:13.073,00:01:14.074,OK.
00:01:14.240,00:01:23.583,"So, there's something in my room that I really, really, really, really love, and it's all around my bedroom."
00:01:23.792,00:01:25.168,Can you guess what it is?
00:01:27.212,00:01:28.088,Cats!
00:01:28.338,00:01:31.841,"Glittery cats, blue cats, cat lamps."
00:01:32.425,00:01:35.929,"And, of course, my real-life kitty, Floyd."
00:01:36.137,00:01:37.138,"Say hi, Floyd."
00:01:42.852,00:01:45.814,And the most cat-tastic thing of all is...
00:01:49.609,00:01:50.652,Check it out.
00:01:51.611,00:01:54.405,There are so many rooms we can play in.
00:02:00.411,00:02:04.582,That sound means it's time for a Dollhouse Delivery! Look!
00:02:14.050,00:02:18.096,"All right. So, this is my Meow Meow Mailbox."
00:02:18.304,00:02:21.182,This is where my Dollhouse surprise always comes.
00:02:21.724,00:02:23.768,Should we see what's inside today?
00:02:24.269,00:02:25.103,Yeah!
00:02:25.478,00:02:26.855,Ooh!
00:02:27.188,00:02:29.732,Look at our kitty-cat surprise box!
00:02:29.816,00:02:33.069,It's covered in sparkly planets and stars.
00:02:34.737,00:02:36.114,Let's see what's inside.
00:02:38.408,00:02:40.326,Meow!
00:02:40.660,00:02:42.871,It's a little kitty spaceship!
00:02:43.204,00:02:44.914,See the little cat ears?
00:02:45.707,00:02:46.875,Spacey.
00:02:47.667,00:02:50.879,"Hey, we should fly this over to the Dollhouse."
00:02:51.254,00:02:52.255,Come on.
00:03:02.432,00:03:07.186,"This is the Fairy Tail Garden, and this is Kitty Fairy."
00:03:08.479,00:03:10.440,See her little fairy wings?
00:03:10.523,00:03:15.069,"She loves anything that can fly, and she is gonna love this spaceship."
00:03:15.737,00:03:18.448,We should go into the Dollhouse and show her! Come on.
00:03:19.240,00:03:21.326,Wait until you see this.
00:03:22.076,00:03:28.666,"With these magical cat ears, I can shrink down and play with the Gabby Cats inside my Dollhouse."
00:03:29.000,00:03:30.835,Time to get tiny.
00:03:39.385,00:03:40.720,Whee!
00:03:41.262,00:03:43.514,"Hey, I'm over here! Come on in!"
00:03:45.308,00:03:47.894,Welcome to my Dollhouse!
00:03:48.102,00:03:50.271,We're in the Fairy Tail Garden.
00:03:50.730,00:03:53.441,"First things first, let's find Pandy."
00:03:53.816,00:03:54.859,Do you see him?
00:04:00.281,00:04:01.532,I don't see him.
00:04:01.908,00:04:03.493,Hug attack!
00:04:05.370,00:04:07.664,"Pandy, you give the best hugs."
00:04:07.830,00:04:09.123,"Oh, hi! It's me."
00:04:11.709,00:04:16.923,"Out there, I was a stuffed animal, but in the Dollhouse, I come alive!"
00:04:17.173,00:04:18.174,Mm! Yeah!
00:04:19.425,00:04:22.095,Everything in the Dollhouse is cat-tastic.
00:04:25.056,00:04:26.349,Check this out.
00:04:26.933,00:04:29.852,"One pinch of my cat ears, and..."
00:04:31.521,00:04:32.814,kitty-cat hair!
00:04:32.981,00:04:36.484,"In the Dollhouse, I can change my hair to whatever I want."
00:04:36.693,00:04:37.986,Like this.
00:04:38.486,00:04:40.154,Rainbow hair!
00:04:40.280,00:04:42.365,Rainbow's my favorite color.
00:04:42.448,00:04:44.826,Ooh! I have an idea.
00:04:47.036,00:04:49.289,Space hair for the spaceship!
00:04:49.372,00:04:52.083,That hair is meow-t of this world!
00:04:54.419,00:04:58.256,"But I do have to say, of all the colors..."
00:05:00.133,00:05:02.260,I like my own color the best.
00:05:02.343,00:05:03.720,"Yep. Me, too."
00:05:08.599,00:05:10.143,Kitty Fairy!
00:05:10.977,00:05:12.145,"Hi, guys!"
00:05:12.228,00:05:14.731,"Hey, Kitty Fairy. What do you think of our spaceship?"
00:05:16.899,00:05:18.901,Ooh! I like spaceships.
00:05:18.985,00:05:20.570,"They fly, like me!"
00:05:20.945,00:05:22.530,I knew she'd love it.
00:05:27.368,00:05:28.828,How do you open this thing?
00:05:29.704,00:05:33.708,"I've never flown a spaceship before, but I'm sure we can figure this out."
00:05:34.125,00:05:37.378,Hmm. Maybe this button opens up the hatch.
00:05:48.306,00:05:49.891,What's all the racket up here?
00:05:50.224,00:05:52.393,"Oh! Hi, CatRat. What's up?"
00:05:52.560,00:05:53.603,What's up?
00:05:54.270,00:05:55.271,Me!
00:05:55.354,00:05:57.774,I was taking a nap before you woke me up.
00:05:59.108,00:06:02.487,"So, if you wouldn't mind, please, keeping it down."
00:06:07.909,00:06:09.744,What have we here?
00:06:12.663,00:06:16.459,"This is the best, shiniest cat bed I've ever seen!"
00:06:16.751,00:06:19.295,"Hey, CatRat, we get to play in there, too."
00:06:19.378,00:06:23.466,You know my motto: Shiny is miney.
00:06:26.302,00:06:27.553,Nighty-nighty.
00:06:35.686,00:06:37.396,"Wake up, CatRat!"
00:06:48.741,00:06:49.867,"Oh, no!"
00:06:49.951,00:06:52.495,CatRat just rolled onto the take-off button!
00:07:05.883,00:07:07.343,"Let me try, Pandy."
00:07:14.267,00:07:15.852,"Oh, snapdragons!"
00:07:16.686,00:07:18.438,I'm just not heavy enough.
00:07:20.565,00:07:23.734,"If we can't reach CatRat, how are we gonna get him down?"
00:07:24.068,00:07:27.697,Hmm. I don't know... yet!
00:07:27.780,00:07:31.451,But I'm sure we'll come up with something. Let's think.
00:07:38.374,00:07:39.375,I got something!
00:07:39.625,00:07:44.714,Maybe we can make something long enough to reach the spaceship and pull it back down.
00:07:45.298,00:07:49.177,"Well, Baby Box can definitely help us make something in the Craft Room."
00:07:49.510,00:07:51.846,"Kitty Fairy, will you keep an eye on CatRat?"
00:07:51.929,00:07:53.598,"You bet I will, Gabby."
00:08:03.399,00:08:05.067,Slide time!
00:08:13.951,00:08:15.328,"-Hey, Cakey! -Hi, Cakey!"
00:08:15.411,00:08:16.412,"Hi, guys!"
00:08:16.871,00:08:18.372,"Ooh, bananas!"
00:08:20.291,00:08:21.876,Little snacky for my packy.
00:08:43.064,00:08:44.315,"Hi, Baby Box."
00:08:44.732,00:08:46.943,"Hi, Gabby. Hi, Pandy."
00:08:51.197,00:08:52.198,What's up?
00:08:52.281,00:08:53.908,"We need your help, Baby Box."
00:08:53.991,00:08:56.202,CatRat accidentally launched our new spaceship.
00:08:56.285,00:08:58.287,-And now he's floating away. -Uh-oh.
00:08:58.371,00:09:03.709,We need to make something super long so we can reach the spaceship and pull him down.
00:09:03.793,00:09:06.045,"Hmm. Oh, I know!"
00:09:09.131,00:09:11.467,What about a space chain?
00:09:13.344,00:09:14.470,That could work.
00:09:14.929,00:09:17.431,But it's a little too short to reach the spaceship.
00:09:17.640,00:09:18.641,No problem.
00:09:18.933,00:09:23.354,We'll make some more and connect them together to make a super-long one.
00:09:23.604,00:09:27.358,"Great thinking, Baby Box. Will you show us how to make them?"
00:09:27.441,00:09:28.609,Of course.
00:09:29.402,00:09:30.570,OK.
00:09:30.653,00:09:35.074,"To make a space chain, first you pick a colorful pipe cleaner."
00:09:35.324,00:09:38.494,Then you bend it into whatever shape you want.
00:09:39.036,00:09:46.502,"Like a star, a swirly galaxy, a moon, or even a planet."
00:09:46.836,00:09:48.588,"Look, I made a Saturn."
00:09:50.172,00:09:55.886,Ooh. I'm gonna make a swirly galaxy with this purple pipe cleaner.
00:10:02.602,00:10:03.811,The Red Planet.
00:10:05.354,00:10:09.567,"Now that we have all our shapes, let's twist them together."
00:10:09.650,00:10:11.193,Let's give it a go!
00:10:13.904,00:10:15.323,Everybody!
00:10:24.582,00:10:26.584,"Pandy, that's really cool!"
00:10:31.839,00:10:34.884,"Oh, Baby Box! I love the pattern you made."
00:10:35.468,00:10:38.137,"Star, planet, moon."
00:10:42.850,00:10:44.060,"Thanks, Gabby!"
00:10:45.144,00:10:46.812,Let's see yours.
00:10:47.188,00:10:48.564,Do you like my ribbons?
00:10:49.482,00:10:52.234,Whoa! Yours is so pretty!
00:10:52.485,00:10:53.819,"Thanks, Baby Box."
00:10:53.903,00:10:59.617,OK. Now let's put our chains together to make one really long chain.
00:11:04.664,00:11:07.124,There. Now it's super long!
00:11:07.208,00:11:09.794,Now we can pull CatRat back to the Dollhouse!
00:11:10.252,00:11:11.796,"Oh, that reminds me."
00:11:11.879,00:11:14.799,Let's check in with Kitty Fairy and see how CatRat's doing.
00:11:14.882,00:11:17.468,"Here you go, Gabby. You can use my box phone."
00:11:18.177,00:11:19.970,Whoosh! Whoosh!
00:11:20.596,00:11:22.765,Boop. Calling Kitty Fairy.
00:11:30.398,00:11:32.900,"Hey, Kitty Fairy. How's CatRat doing?"
00:11:32.983,00:11:38.656,"Well, he's still asleep, and the spaceship is floating a little further away, but it's all good."
00:11:38.739,00:11:39.573,Great!
00:11:40.241,00:11:43.411,Baby Box helped us make a super-long space chain.
00:11:43.494,00:11:45.621,It will definitely reach the spaceship.
00:11:45.704,00:11:47.248,Flower-iffic!
00:11:47.331,00:11:48.332,See you soon!
00:11:49.166,00:11:50.626,"Thanks, Baby Box."
00:11:50.876,00:11:51.919,Anytime.
00:11:54.004,00:11:56.882,Uh-oh! That sounds like Cakey in the Kitchen.
00:11:57.508,00:12:00.469,-And it sounds like he's in trouble. -We have to help him.
00:12:03.264,00:12:04.265,Bye!
00:12:06.600,00:12:09.270,"Back to the Kitchen, Cat-A-Vator! And fast!"
00:12:16.944,00:12:19.071,Gabby! Pandy!
00:12:19.238,00:12:21.282,Help! Wah-ha!
00:12:21.365,00:12:23.159,"Cakey, what happened, buddy?"
00:12:25.828,00:12:30.541,"I was making my Sticky Cat Paws frosting, and... and..."
00:12:30.916,00:12:33.752,I got sticky-stuck!
00:12:33.836,00:12:36.130,Wah-ha-ha-ha!
00:12:36.213,00:12:38.841,Can't let perfectly yummy sprinkles go to waste.
00:12:39.383,00:12:42.136,"Aww. It's OK to be upset, Cakey."
00:12:42.219,00:12:43.554,But help is here.
00:12:44.346,00:12:49.143,"First, let's take a deep breath to make you feel better, and then we'll get you down."
00:12:50.019,00:12:51.270,Let's breathe in...
00:12:53.355,00:12:54.607,...and then out.
00:12:56.817,00:12:58.152,Let's breathe in...
00:13:00.571,00:13:01.947,...and then out.
00:13:05.034,00:13:08.037,I... I do feel a little better now.
00:13:08.662,00:13:10.581,"All right, let's get you down."
00:13:15.711,00:13:16.545,Ooh!
00:13:17.087,00:13:20.841,"Wow, he's really stuck! I don't know how we're gonna get him down."
00:13:20.925,00:13:24.553,Y-You... You don't know how to get me down?
00:13:27.431,00:13:32.436,"Cakey, we don't know how to get you down yet, but we're not giving up."
00:13:33.103,00:13:35.898,I wonder what we could use to unstick Cakey?
00:13:42.863,00:13:45.574,"Great idea, Cakey! Let's give it a go!"
00:13:45.950,00:13:49.203,"OK, we're all gonna need to work together on this one."
00:13:49.537,00:13:50.871,"Cakey, you wiggle."
00:13:51.247,00:13:52.831,"Wiggle, wiggle!"
00:13:53.040,00:13:56.001,"I'll spatula. And Pandy, you catch."
00:13:59.505,00:14:00.381,Ready?
00:14:01.715,00:14:03.884,"OK, Cakey, wiggle!"
00:14:04.176,00:14:05.344,I'm wiggling!
00:14:05.427,00:14:07.721,"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle!"
00:14:10.891,00:14:11.892,It's working!
00:14:12.101,00:14:14.603,"Pandy, get ready to... catch!"
00:14:16.021,00:14:18.524,I got him! I got him! Catch!
00:14:18.732,00:14:19.984,Uh-oh. Oof!
00:14:22.528,00:14:23.904,You saved me!
00:14:23.988,00:14:26.156,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
00:14:26.490,00:14:28.409,Sprinkle party!
00:14:30.160,00:14:33.539,"Hey, the happy sprinkles are even more delicious!"
00:14:34.123,00:14:40.087,"Oh, Gabby, Pandy, since you're here, do you want to learn how to make my Sticky Cat Paws?"
00:14:43.382,00:14:47.887,OK. Let's grab some dough and give it a go!
00:14:49.179,00:14:52.600,"All right, Cakey, how do you make these yummy, sticky treats?"
00:14:52.683,00:14:55.769,"I'll show you. First, we roll the dough."
00:15:02.735,00:15:05.279,Uh-oh. I think I made a mistake.
00:15:05.446,00:15:07.448,My swirl looks more like a smush.
00:15:07.615,00:15:10.159,"It's OK, Pandy. Mistakes can be messy."
00:15:10.409,00:15:12.161,I like your smush.
00:15:12.453,00:15:14.413,It probably still tastes good.
00:15:14.872,00:15:16.999,Now roll the toes!
00:15:24.006,00:15:27.176,Then we add my super-sticky frosting. Yeah!
00:15:29.929,00:15:32.306,-And now... -This is my favorite part.
00:15:32.932,00:15:35.017,Eat them up! Eat them up!
00:15:47.112,00:15:48.989,I love bakey with Cakey!
00:15:50.950,00:15:52.326,I'll take this one for later.
00:15:52.826,00:15:54.036,"Move over, banana."
00:15:57.247,00:15:58.374,"Oh! Hi, Floyd."
00:16:06.298,00:16:08.884,"Gabby, Pandy, we got a big problem!"
00:16:08.968,00:16:11.595,Look! CatRat floated out of the Dollhouse!
00:16:15.641,00:16:18.102,"No, Floyd! That's not a kitty toy!"
00:16:22.064,00:16:24.066,Hmm? Huh? What's going on?
00:16:27.611,00:16:29.446,"I need help, please!"
00:16:42.334,00:16:43.460,"Go away, Floyd!"
00:16:52.386,00:16:54.638,"Gabby, you got to get me out of here!"
00:16:54.972,00:16:56.598,"We'll save you, CatRat!"
00:16:59.143,00:17:02.146,"Well, can you hurry up, please?"
00:17:02.604,00:17:03.605,Here we go.
00:17:07.776,00:17:10.070,"Oh, no! It bounced right off!"
00:17:10.404,00:17:15.743,"If only we had something sticky to put on the end of the chain, then it would stick to the ship."
00:17:22.416,00:17:24.293,Uh... Pandy!
00:17:24.710,00:17:27.046,What? Do I have frosting on my whiskers?
00:17:28.047,00:17:32.593,No. But we can use that Sticky Cat Paw to stick to the end of the space chain.
00:17:32.885,00:17:33.927,"Oh, right!"
00:17:36.764,00:17:37.639,Thanks!
00:17:44.772,00:17:47.107,"Come on, Gabby! You can do it!"
00:17:53.947,00:17:55.908,Hooray for Sticky Cat Paws!
00:17:55.991,00:17:57.201,"-Go, Gabby! -Yay! Wahoo!"
00:17:59.036,00:18:02.539,"Uh... Guys, I'm still out here!"
00:18:03.791,00:18:06.251,"Oh, right. Let's go, everybody."
00:18:08.337,00:18:09.338,Pull!
00:18:11.173,00:18:12.716,"Yeah, pull!"
00:18:22.142,00:18:25.145,"-All right! -Yay, CatRat! You're safe!"
00:18:26.730,00:18:28.982,It's about time you got me out of there.
00:18:29.733,00:18:31.193,"Aww, CatRat!"
00:18:31.276,00:18:33.987,You know we'd never let anything happen to you.
00:18:34.196,00:18:36.490,What would we do without our CatRat?
00:18:39.034,00:18:40.869,Huh. That's right.
00:18:40.953,00:18:44.873,You should think about that the next time you leave a flying cat bed lying around.
00:18:47.668,00:18:49.419,It's a spaceship!
00:18:49.586,00:18:50.796,A spaceship?
00:18:51.130,00:18:53.173,Uh... I knew that!
00:18:53.257,00:18:55.425,"We're glad you're back, CatRat."
00:18:56.468,00:18:57.302,Oh.
00:18:58.929,00:19:02.266,What do you say we take this spaceship out for a proper spin?
00:19:05.936,00:19:07.354,Everybody ready?
00:19:07.521,00:19:09.106,-Yeah! -I am so ready!
00:19:09.189,00:19:10.399,"Yeah, let's do it!"
00:19:10.607,00:19:12.192,Here we go!
00:19:28.917,00:19:30.460,This is awesome!
00:19:30.586,00:19:32.087,Ooh! Look what I found.
00:19:32.171,00:19:34.214,The party button!
00:19:40.179,00:19:43.223,"Come on, CatRat. Let yourself groove a little bit."
00:19:44.433,00:19:46.393,"Oh, fine."
00:19:46.810,00:19:47.978,"Oh, yeah!"
00:19:48.061,00:19:49.771,Grooving in a spaceship!
00:19:59.531,00:20:01.658,Thanks for playing in the Dollhouse with me.
00:20:01.950,00:20:04.494,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:20:22.262,00:20:23.931,Hi. Cakey here.
00:20:24.139,00:20:28.143,There's nothing I love more than a sprinkle party!
00:22:04.364,00:22:06.158,Cakeylicious!
00:22:32.934,00:22:35.062,Thanks for playing in the Dollhouse with me.
00:22:35.145,00:22:38.440,Come back soon and we'll open another Dollhouse surprise!
00:22:38.732,00:22:39.733,Bye.
00:00:47.964,00:00:51.009,Hey! Check this out. I'm drawing a picture of Floyd.
00:00:51.551,00:00:58.308,"Here's his furry body, his cute little head, two ears, and his fuzzy tail."
00:00:58.725,00:00:59.559,There.
00:01:00.226,00:01:01.227,Ta-da!
00:01:02.145,00:01:03.480,What do you guys think?
00:01:08.735,00:01:10.820,"Oh. Yeah, I can see that."
00:01:11.362,00:01:14.365,Floyd and spaghetti: Two of my favorite things mixed together.
00:01:16.201,00:01:20.121,Ooh! You know what that sound means. It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery!
00:01:20.288,00:01:21.289,Come on.
00:01:33.134,00:01:36.805,Let's see what's inside of our Meow Meow Mailbox today.
00:01:41.601,00:01:42.519,Ooh!
00:01:42.602,00:01:45.688,It's a really glittery box. Should we open it?
00:01:46.648,00:01:47.649,Yeah.
00:01:49.901,00:01:51.861,This paper is so shiny.
00:01:52.654,00:01:54.489,"OK, let's see."
00:01:55.615,00:01:57.450,It's a glitter globe!
00:01:58.076,00:02:00.036,With the Dollhouse inside!
00:02:00.870,00:02:02.288,"Hey, wait a minute."
00:02:03.081,00:02:04.749,This is strange.
00:02:05.250,00:02:06.835,The roof is on the bottom...
00:02:07.961,00:02:09.671,the ear is on the side...
00:02:10.130,00:02:12.298,but this Dollhouse is all mixed up.
00:02:13.466,00:02:15.552,Hmm. Let's see what happens when we shake it.
00:02:19.139,00:02:21.558,Ooh. That didn't sound good.
00:02:24.227,00:02:27.438,Maybe someone in the Dollhouse can help us fix it. Come on.
00:02:31.860,00:02:33.361,"Hey, wait a minute."
00:02:33.736,00:02:37.615,The bathtub is in the music room? That doesn't belong there!
00:02:37.949,00:02:39.534,That goes in the bathroom.
00:02:40.201,00:02:41.327,Hmm.
00:02:43.037,00:02:48.501,"I think when I shook this mixed-up glitter globe, it mixed up the Dollhouse."
00:02:52.380,00:02:54.757,Time to get tiny.
00:03:03.349,00:03:04.475,Whee!
00:03:04.559,00:03:06.019,Come on in! Hurry!
00:03:07.937,00:03:09.188,Gabby!
00:03:09.772,00:03:10.773,MerCat?
00:03:11.024,00:03:12.609,"Oh, thank goodness you're here!"
00:03:12.817,00:03:18.948,"I was getting ready to take a bath, when I heard these really silly sounds, and, poof, I'm here."
00:03:19.324,00:03:23.661,"I think I know what happened, MerCat. Let's find Pandy, then I can show you."
00:03:24.495,00:03:25.914,Do you see Pandy?
00:03:28.958,00:03:31.502,I don't see him. Where is he?
00:03:35.965,00:03:37.383,"Oh, Pandy."
00:03:39.844,00:03:42.388,"Hey! Hey! What's up, guys?"
00:03:42.472,00:03:43.723,"Hey, DJ Catnip."
00:03:46.267,00:03:47.268,Whoa!
00:03:47.769,00:03:50.230,Uh... Bathtub in the music room?
00:03:50.897,00:03:52.482,This is kind of funky.
00:03:52.649,00:03:57.528,But... now I won't have to walk upstairs to take a bath!
00:03:57.862,00:04:00.823,"Sorry, Catnip. The bathtub cannot stay here."
00:04:00.907,00:04:03.534,Don't worry. We'll figure this out.
00:04:04.118,00:04:07.163,I think this happened when I shook this mixed-up glitter globe.
00:04:07.413,00:04:10.917,"Well, maybe if we just shake it again, it will fix the problem."
00:04:11.209,00:04:13.962,"Whoa! Pandy, that might make things worse."
00:04:26.182,00:04:27.558,"A little help, please?"
00:04:31.771,00:04:33.022,It's way too heavy.
00:04:34.732,00:04:36.859,We're gonna need another solution.
00:04:37.151,00:04:38.278,Let's think.
00:04:46.577,00:04:51.040,"You know, sometimes a little music helps me come up with new ideas."
00:04:52.709,00:04:53.710,Let's try it.
00:04:58.089,00:05:00.550,Ooh! That's a bubbly little tune.
00:05:02.051,00:05:05.013,A bubbly little tune? That gives me an idea.
00:05:05.096,00:05:07.307,We can solve this problem with a little...
00:05:14.480,00:05:15.732,Travel bubbles?
00:05:15.815,00:05:17.650,Never leave home without them.
00:05:25.366,00:05:27.368,Sure. I love bubbles.
00:05:35.960,00:05:38.296,Now it's a real bubbly tune.
00:05:38.504,00:05:41.049,Whoa! Look at all the bubbles!
00:05:41.924,00:05:44.635,"Gabby, Pandy, hop in!"
00:05:50.767,00:05:52.477,We're floating!
00:05:52.560,00:05:54.270,You've got to be kitten me!
00:06:29.347,00:06:32.600,Uh-oh! We're floating right past the bathroom.
00:06:32.767,00:06:33.893,Not a problem.
00:06:33.976,00:06:37.688,We just need to pop some of these bubbles and lower ourselves down.
00:06:37.772,00:06:39.774,Yes! I love popping bubbles!
00:06:43.069,00:06:44.529,We're almost there!
00:06:48.199,00:06:51.619,"Oh, thanks for helping me with that bathtub mix-up."
00:06:54.455,00:06:55.623,Thank you!
00:06:55.832,00:06:58.835,Your Spa Science is mer-mazing!
00:07:06.342,00:07:07.802,"Thanks, DJ Catnip."
00:07:16.561,00:07:19.480,I thought I heard some music down here.
00:07:20.690,00:07:22.066,"Oh, what's up, CatRat?"
00:07:22.233,00:07:26.112,I was just playing something to help the bathtub fly back up to the bathroom.
00:07:26.237,00:07:28.448,"-Oh. -All right, I'll catch you later."
00:07:30.825,00:07:35.371,Did he just say he was helping fly the bathtub back up to the bathroom?
00:07:36.038,00:07:37.623,I got to get my ears checked.
00:07:39.667,00:07:40.668,Oh!
00:07:43.087,00:07:44.422,What do we have here?
00:07:46.507,00:07:48.801,Shiny is miney!
00:07:51.512,00:07:54.015,Some glitter sprinkles for you.
00:07:54.765,00:07:57.059,"Oh, can't forget you, little cookie."
00:08:00.396,00:08:02.273,"Sprinkle, sprinkle, sprinkle!"
00:08:04.650,00:08:06.194,Just passing through.
00:08:13.910,00:08:15.453,Maybe if I shake it.
00:08:17.038,00:08:18.706,I think this thing is broken.
00:08:25.171,00:08:28.424,Help! Gabby! Pandy!
00:08:28.716,00:08:31.511,-That sounds like Cakey! -Let's go see what's going on.
00:08:31.844,00:08:34.388,"-Bye, MerCat! -Bye! Oh, and good luck!"
00:08:40.645,00:08:41.646,Whoa!
00:08:41.812,00:08:44.232,I love what Cakey's done with the place.
00:08:44.440,00:08:46.484,"Cakey? Where are you, buddy?"
00:08:48.778,00:08:50.696,"Oh! Hang on, Cakey!"
00:08:54.158,00:08:56.118,"Oh, thank you!"
00:08:56.285,00:08:59.247,"No problem, buddy. What happened in here?"
00:08:59.413,00:09:02.250,"Well, CatRat came by with the glitter globe."
00:09:02.500,00:09:04.961,Then I heard all kinds of silly sounds.
00:09:05.378,00:09:08.589,"The next thing I know, I'm covered in glitter sprinkles."
00:09:09.382,00:09:10.383,Uh-oh.
00:09:10.466,00:09:13.970,CatRat must have picked up the mixed-up glitter globe and shook it up.
00:09:14.053,00:09:16.889,And now my whole kitchen's covered in glitter sprinkles?
00:09:17.890,00:09:20.476,This is gonna take forever to clean up.
00:09:23.896,00:09:26.941,"It's OK, Cakey. We'll help you clean this up."
00:09:29.527,00:09:30.695,Of course.
00:09:30.987,00:09:35.032,Then we'll find CatRat and make sure he doesn't shake that thing again.
00:09:37.034,00:09:39.620,"Hey, check out my moves!"
00:09:41.706,00:09:44.041,"Sweet sweep style, Pandy."
00:09:45.751,00:09:47.086,Sweep style?
00:09:48.879,00:09:50.631,"Oh, yeah! Look at that!"
00:09:50.715,00:09:53.551,I'm sweeping in style.
00:09:53.634,00:09:56.596,Pandy! That's a cat-tastic idea!
00:09:56.846,00:10:00.600,We can use our sweep styles to clean this Kitchen up fast.
00:10:00.975,00:10:02.393,I have just the thing!
00:10:03.603,00:10:05.688,Put these sponges on your feet.
00:10:42.767,00:10:44.560,Yes! We did it!
00:10:46.562,00:10:48.230,Oops! Sorry.
00:10:50.358,00:10:55.071,OK. Now we just need to figure out what to do with this giant pile of glitter.
00:10:55.321,00:10:57.990,"Well, we just sweep-styled it off the floor."
00:10:58.074,00:10:59.700,I can't put it on my cookies.
00:11:01.285,00:11:02.995,That gives me an idea.
00:11:07.541,00:11:09.085,"Now, check this out."
00:11:12.963,00:11:16.092,Meowser! I love this Dollhouse!
00:11:17.718,00:11:21.430,"I think these cookies could use some glitter sprinkles, don't you?"
00:11:24.558,00:11:26.894,The glitter sprinkles stuck to the cookie!
00:11:28.354,00:11:30.564,You try this one. Ready?
00:11:31.982,00:11:32.983,Blow!
00:11:38.114,00:11:43.202,"All right, to get rid of this giant pile, we're gonna have to all blow together."
00:11:51.127,00:11:52.128,two...
00:11:52.545,00:11:53.546,three...
00:11:54.130,00:11:55.423,blow!
00:12:03.889,00:12:06.016,Sparkly cookie wallpaper?
00:12:06.308,00:12:08.853,It's like a dream come true!
00:12:09.770,00:12:11.021,Nice job!
00:12:11.147,00:12:14.733,"-Oh, these look good enough to eat! -Oh, that reminds me."
00:12:18.320,00:12:19.572,Don't mind if I do.
00:12:19.780,00:12:21.490,A little snacky for my packy.
00:12:23.409,00:12:25.244,Thanks for cleaning up with me.
00:12:25.411,00:12:26.704,"You're welcome, Cakey."
00:12:26.787,00:12:29.790,I'm just glad we were able to clean up that mix-up.
00:12:32.001,00:12:35.754,"As long as we find CatRat in time, nothing else can go wrong now."
00:12:47.308,00:12:50.895,"Hey, Carlita. You got to check out this weird whatchamjiggy."
00:12:51.395,00:12:52.646,"Just a second, CatRat."
00:12:52.730,00:12:54.773,I'm right in the middle of tennis practice.
00:12:57.443,00:12:58.944,And get all sweaty?
00:12:59.445,00:13:02.072,You know I hate getting wet. Geh!
00:13:02.406,00:13:03.407,Have fun.
00:13:07.786,00:13:09.663,How am I gonna fix this thing?
00:13:09.914,00:13:11.040,Oh.
00:13:11.123,00:13:13.459,Maybe if I shake it super hard.
00:13:16.212,00:13:17.922,"Nope, still broken."
00:13:23.135,00:13:25.095,Huh? Toilet paper?
00:13:29.683,00:13:30.684,Argh!
00:13:34.188,00:13:35.689,Ricocheting rolls!
00:13:37.942,00:13:38.943,Help!
00:13:40.736,00:13:42.446,"Whoa! Pandy, look out!"
00:13:42.530,00:13:44.615,Since when can toilet paper fly?
00:13:48.202,00:13:49.787,"-Watch out, Gabby! -Whoa!"
00:13:50.037,00:13:53.415,"My tennis balls, they turned into toilet paper!"
00:14:00.339,00:14:02.466,Wait a minute. Did you see that?
00:14:11.058,00:14:14.979,"When I hit the toilet paper, it turned back into a tennis ball."
00:14:16.814,00:14:17.982,"Come on, Pandy!"
00:14:22.361,00:14:24.363,"Toilet-paper tennis, anyone?"
00:14:26.740,00:14:27.741,I'm in.
00:14:27.825,00:14:29.869,I'm always in for a good game.
00:14:30.744,00:14:34.957,OK. Everybody stand in front of one of the launchers. I'll be red.
00:14:40.421,00:14:43.215,You tell us which color lights up so we can hit it.
00:14:43.632,00:14:44.633,Ready?
00:14:44.717,00:14:45.759,Here we go!
00:14:46.886,00:14:49.013,Which color is lighting up?
00:14:50.431,00:14:51.432,Red!
00:14:55.853,00:14:57.062,Now which color?
00:15:06.739,00:15:07.615,Hi-yah!
00:15:09.450,00:15:11.327,It's working! Keep going.
00:15:13.704,00:15:14.872,Now which color?
00:15:29.553,00:15:30.554,"Oh, yeah!"
00:15:32.264,00:15:33.098,Yeah!
00:15:36.352,00:15:37.519,We did it!
00:15:38.729,00:15:41.899,We turned all the toilet paper back to tennis balls.
00:15:41.982,00:15:43.359,Wahoo! Yeah!
00:15:43.692,00:15:46.946,Thanks for your help. You were cat-tastic!
00:15:47.071,00:15:49.823,You guys really saved my bumpers on that one.
00:15:52.534,00:15:55.412,First time I've ever played toilet-paper tennis.
00:15:57.122,00:15:59.208,I do love a new experience.
00:16:02.086,00:16:04.296,"-Hey, Baby Box. -Oh, hey, CatRat."
00:16:07.424,00:16:10.094,-You think you can help me fix it? -Sure!
00:16:10.511,00:16:13.931,Listen. It makes all these silly sounds when you shake it.
00:16:21.772,00:16:23.899,Gah! What happened to me?
00:16:24.358,00:16:25.609,I'm... I'm...
00:16:26.360,00:16:27.861,I'm CraftRat!
00:16:28.195,00:16:29.947,This is horrible!
00:16:30.322,00:16:33.117,"Whoa, CatRat! What happened?"
00:16:33.325,00:16:35.035,He shook that thing.
00:16:35.327,00:16:39.665,"Then, suddenly, he was him, but made out of crafts!"
00:16:39.748,00:16:44.128,"I look like something you stick to the fridge with little, itty-bitty magnets!"
00:16:44.420,00:16:46.255,Somebody's got to fix me!
00:16:47.423,00:16:48.799,Would a cookie cheer you up?
00:16:49.967,00:16:52.553,I can't eat a cookie with a paper head!
00:16:52.761,00:16:55.639,"Oh, right. I'll save it for you for later."
00:16:55.806,00:16:57.016,"Don't worry, CatRat."
00:16:57.099,00:17:01.311,"We'll find a way to get you back to your regular, scruffy, fluffy little self."
00:17:03.439,00:17:05.232,How are we gonna fix this one?
00:17:05.315,00:17:07.401,I don't know... yet!
00:17:08.027,00:17:12.531,"But maybe if we fix the mixed-up glitter globe, we can fix CatRat."
00:17:12.614,00:17:14.908,"I'm already working on it, Gabby."
00:17:16.785,00:17:19.371,Here are the pieces of the mixed-up glitter globe.
00:17:19.788,00:17:23.167,And here's the blueprint of the Dollhouse.
00:17:23.250,00:17:25.836,We just have to match the pieces.
00:17:26.545,00:17:27.671,Like a puzzle!
00:17:35.429,00:17:36.638,Right here.
00:17:44.313,00:17:46.106,"Oh, yeah! Right here!"
00:17:49.943,00:17:51.779,Where do these pieces go?
00:17:55.074,00:17:56.158,Right here.
00:18:02.414,00:18:04.166,"Oh, yeah! The tail!"
00:18:05.667,00:18:08.921,"CatRat, do you want to put on the last piece?"
00:18:09.588,00:18:10.547,I'll try.
00:18:14.968,00:18:16.720,I can't grab anything!
00:18:16.804,00:18:18.263,"I'll do it for you, CatRat."
00:18:19.181,00:18:20.933,Where does the Cat-A-Vator go?
00:18:24.603,00:18:26.355,"Oh, yeah, right in the middle."
00:18:26.980,00:18:27.981,We did it!
00:18:29.358,00:18:31.610,It's fixed! Wahoo!
00:18:32.402,00:18:34.196,But I'm not back to normal.
00:18:34.738,00:18:37.074,I think we need to do one more thing.
00:18:37.699,00:18:40.119,Shake it? Do we get to shake it?
00:18:40.410,00:18:41.578,We sure do!
00:18:41.662,00:18:43.664,Yes! Finally!
00:18:44.123,00:18:45.290,OK.
00:18:45.666,00:18:48.877,"Everybody say, Shake, shake, shake!"
00:19:00.472,00:19:02.224,"Oh, I missed me."
00:19:02.516,00:19:05.769,"-Thanks, guys. -We'll always help you out, CatRat."
00:19:07.479,00:19:09.064,I'll take that cookie now.
00:19:10.899,00:19:12.276,"Why, thank you."
00:19:15.863,00:19:18.532,Hey! Did you fix the mixed-up glitter globe?
00:19:18.615,00:19:21.410,"We sure did! You want to show them, Pandy?"
00:19:21.577,00:19:22.828,I get to shake it?
00:19:23.245,00:19:24.705,You bet I do!
00:19:24.997,00:19:26.290,"Shake, shake, shake!"
00:19:32.963,00:19:35.632,Thanks for helping me fix the mixed-up glitter globe.
00:19:36.091,00:19:38.177,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:19:53.901,00:19:58.197,"Pom-poms and polka dots! It's me, Baby Box!"
00:19:59.364,00:20:01.408,You want to see something I love?
00:20:02.117,00:20:05.370,This is my glitter globe!
00:20:07.956,00:20:17.466,"When I get upset about something, and I want to calm down, I just shake up my glitter globe and take a big breath, like this."
00:20:18.842,00:20:20.761,Then I breathe out...
00:20:22.262,00:20:25.140,...and watch the glitter all fall down.
00:20:26.266,00:20:28.393,It really helps me feel better.
00:20:28.977,00:20:30.896,Do you want to make one with me?
00:20:32.606,00:20:33.982,Let's get crafting!
00:20:34.191,00:20:48.956,"You're gonna need a jar with a lid, some pipe cleaners, a marker, two little triangles of paper, your trusty glue stick, some water, and... some sparkly glitter!"
00:20:49.206,00:20:52.251,I love glitter. It's so sparkly!
00:20:53.335,00:20:57.089,"OK, first we're gonna draw a kitty face on the jar."
00:20:57.297,00:21:01.510,Turn the jar upside down so the opening is on the bottom.
00:21:01.802,00:21:10.435,"Then take your marker and draw two little kitty eyes, a cute little nose, and a big smile."
00:21:10.644,00:21:11.478,There.
00:21:12.187,00:21:15.274,Now let's give this kitty some pipe-cleaner whiskers.
00:21:15.774,00:21:22.155,"Use your trusty glue stick and stick the whiskers on the side of the kitty face, like this."
00:21:22.489,00:21:23.323,There.
00:21:24.074,00:21:27.995,"As the glue dries, pour your water into the jar."
00:21:29.413,00:21:30.497,Whoops!
00:21:30.580,00:21:31.581,That's OK.
00:21:33.333,00:21:35.168,Then we pour in the glitter.
00:21:36.795,00:21:38.130,So sparkly!
00:21:40.007,00:21:41.341,Grab your lid.
00:21:41.842,00:21:46.680,Make sure you put the lid on super tight so none of the water leaks out.
00:21:47.055,00:21:49.599,Then turn it over for the finishing touch.
00:21:51.059,00:21:52.436,Kitty ears!
00:21:54.104,00:21:59.568,You have to fold the bottom of your kitty ears a little bit so you can put glue on them.
00:22:02.779,00:22:04.156,Then stick them on.
00:22:04.448,00:22:06.700,"One, two!"
00:22:07.284,00:22:08.285,Ta-da!
00:22:08.827,00:22:10.495,Let's give it a try.
00:22:10.787,00:22:12.497,Shake it like this...
00:22:13.165,00:22:14.207,breathe in...
00:22:15.917,00:22:17.336,...and breathe out.
00:22:19.838,00:22:22.132,That always makes me feel better.
00:22:22.883,00:22:25.469,I can't wait for you to try yours.
00:22:30.766,00:22:34.102,"Baby Box is right, glitter does make everything better."
00:22:34.561,00:22:36.271,See you next time and we'll...
00:22:36.897,00:22:38.648,shake up another adventure.
00:22:38.732,00:22:39.566,Bye.
00:00:48.590,00:00:51.342,Hey. I was just adding a new toy to Floyd's cat wall.
00:00:54.262,00:00:59.768,"See? Places to play, places to climb, and places to sleep and just chill out."
00:01:01.853,00:01:03.229,"Don't you, Floyd?"
00:01:04.773,00:01:06.775,All comfy and cozy in there.
00:01:09.110,00:01:12.781,You know what that sound means. It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery!
00:01:12.864,00:01:13.698,Come on.
00:01:24.459,00:01:27.921,"Hi, Pandy. Do you want to see what's inside of the Meow Meow Mailbox today?"
00:01:32.842,00:01:35.804,We got a furry little box.
00:01:39.349,00:01:41.100,Let's see what's inside.
00:01:43.853,00:01:45.313,Ooh!
00:01:48.233,00:01:52.070,"Hmm. What's inside of you, little carton? Tiny eggs?"
00:01:52.403,00:01:54.072,Maybe. Let's see.
00:01:56.991,00:01:59.410,"Oh, my! Adorable!"
00:01:59.994,00:02:02.330,Look at these cuties!
00:02:02.664,00:02:05.875,"They're part-hamster, part-kitty."
00:02:06.543,00:02:08.378,They're Hamster Kitties!
00:02:08.711,00:02:11.631,"Oh, I love their sweet faces."
00:02:11.881,00:02:14.134,And they're so soft and round.
00:02:17.345,00:02:23.560,"She really, really, really, really, really wants a pet, and she's gonna love these."
00:02:23.935,00:02:24.936,Come on.
00:02:28.106,00:02:31.526,I can't wait to introduce these guys to Baby Box.
00:02:32.527,00:02:34.612,"In you go, little Hamster Kitties."
00:02:34.696,00:02:35.822,See you soon!
00:02:49.586,00:02:50.753,Whee!
00:02:50.837,00:02:53.214,What are you waiting out there for? Come on in.
00:02:56.175,00:02:58.386,Welcome to my Dollhouse.
00:02:58.469,00:03:01.097,"First things first, let's find Pandy."
00:03:01.347,00:03:02.390,Do you see him?
00:03:04.350,00:03:05.852,Hug attack!
00:03:07.937,00:03:09.731,"Oh. Hi, Pandy."
00:03:09.939,00:03:10.940,Hello!
00:03:12.483,00:03:14.444,"Hey, Gabby. Hey, Pandy."
00:03:14.694,00:03:16.529,I like your egg carton.
00:03:16.613,00:03:20.033,"Well, if you like this, wait until you see what's inside."
00:03:24.579,00:03:26.623,"Oh, my goodness!"
00:03:26.706,00:03:28.291,Hamster Kitties!
00:03:29.000,00:03:30.668,They're so sweet!
00:03:32.545,00:03:33.880,We knew you'd like them.
00:03:42.722,00:03:45.767,I've never seen anything this cute!
00:03:48.603,00:03:49.896,And squeaky.
00:03:55.109,00:03:56.402,They're gonna love it.
00:04:02.700,00:04:05.245,It's a cardboard Ferris wheel!
00:04:14.212,00:04:17.840,"OK, that's the cutest thing I have ever seen."
00:04:24.806,00:04:26.557,Hamster Kitties!
00:04:27.892,00:04:30.353,"They're so cute, and I love them!"
00:04:30.728,00:04:33.189,I think they should come live with us.
00:04:33.439,00:04:35.024,"Please, please, please?"
00:04:35.775,00:04:40.530,"I'll give them water and food, and I'll play with them every single day."
00:04:40.613,00:04:43.366,"-Please, Mama? Please? -Whoa!"
00:04:43.449,00:04:49.914,"Baby Box, I know you're excited, but taking care of a pet is a lot of work and responsibility."
00:04:49.998,00:04:55.420,"But I've wanted a pet for so long, and I know how to take care of them."
00:04:55.503,00:04:56.546,Look!
00:05:00.174,00:05:02.176,I don't see them anywhere.
00:05:02.302,00:05:05.930,"Don't worry, Baby Box. Hamster Kitties love to scoot around."
00:05:06.014,00:05:10.018,They must be in the Dollhouse somewhere. Why don't you guys go look for them?
00:05:10.101,00:05:13.271,Yeah. We'll help find those silly little fluffers.
00:05:13.354,00:05:15.815,OK. Where should we start looking?
00:05:15.898,00:05:18.192,Hmm. I don't know...
00:05:18.860,00:05:19.902,yet.
00:05:19.986,00:05:21.571,But I'm sure we can figure it out.
00:05:22.488,00:05:25.033,"Hey, you could help us look for them."
00:05:25.408,00:05:27.201,Do you see any Hamster Kitties?
00:05:32.415,00:05:36.336,Let's go get those Hamster Kitties!
00:06:02.612,00:06:06.324,"Hey, kittens. What's got your motors moving today?"
00:06:06.407,00:06:08.493,We're looking for some Hamster Kitties.
00:06:08.576,00:06:09.660,Hamster Kitties?
00:06:10.369,00:06:12.080,I haven't seen any around here.
00:06:33.476,00:06:38.231,They went into the wallpaper game. How are we gonna get them out of there?
00:06:38.481,00:06:42.276,"Beep, beep! Don't worry, Baby Box. We can play the game to get them out."
00:06:42.360,00:06:43.861,"Everybody, hop in!"
00:06:44.529,00:06:45.905,Seatbelts on.
00:06:45.988,00:06:47.323,Hold on tight!
00:06:52.662,00:06:57.333,"Pandy, do you have anything in your Pandy Pack we can use to scoop up the Hamster Kitties?"
00:06:57.416,00:06:59.043,Of course I do!
00:06:59.460,00:07:01.587,My Snack Net should do the trick.
00:07:01.921,00:07:02.922,Nice!
00:07:36.914,00:07:40.293,Phew! I can't keep up! This is impossible!
00:07:40.543,00:07:44.589,Nothing's impossible. There's got to be something else we could try.
00:07:44.672,00:07:47.467,They sure do love to eat. Kind of like me.
00:07:47.675,00:07:51.471,"If I was a Hamster Kitty, I'd be chasing that food trail, too."
00:07:51.762,00:07:52.847,That's it!
00:07:52.930,00:07:58.811,"If we scoop up all the Hamster Kitty bites, maybe we can get them to chase us."
00:07:58.895,00:08:01.439,"Beep, beep! Now, that's an idea I like."
00:08:01.647,00:08:03.441,Let's give it a go!
00:08:37.850,00:08:40.770,"-Here they come, Pandy. -I'm on it!"
00:08:48.402,00:08:49.403,Gotcha!
00:08:55.243,00:08:57.036,That gives me an idea!
00:08:58.120,00:08:59.914,"What are you doing, Baby Box?"
00:08:59.997,00:09:05.836,I'm gonna write down all the things Hamster Kitties like so I know how to take care of them someday.
00:09:06.754,00:09:09.882,Love to eat.
00:09:10.424,00:09:11.259,There!
00:09:15.513,00:09:17.390,"Smart thinking, Baby Box."
00:09:17.473,00:09:18.307,Boop.
00:09:19.308,00:09:20.977,"Where should we look next, Gabby?"
00:09:23.271,00:09:25.523,"OK, we need your help again."
00:09:25.731,00:09:27.775,Do you see any more Hamster Kitties?
00:09:28.109,00:09:29.402,What room are they in?
00:09:34.073,00:09:35.449,"Bye, Carlita!"
00:09:36.826,00:09:37.827,Thanks!
00:09:37.952,00:09:39.579,"Beep, beep! Good luck!"
00:10:07.440,00:10:09.150,Hamster Kitties!
00:10:09.233,00:10:11.944,We've been looking everywhere for you!
00:10:12.028,00:10:14.238,You little fluffer-nutters!
00:10:17.450,00:10:19.619,And the Hamster Kitties are off!
00:10:24.790,00:10:26.667,"He dives, he slides..."
00:10:28.711,00:10:30.755,Good thing he's made of stuffing.
00:10:31.088,00:10:32.089,I'm OK.
00:10:34.216,00:10:35.885,There goes Baby Box.
00:10:47.438,00:10:49.398,But Cakey won't be stopped.
00:10:49.482,00:10:51.442,He flies! He slides!
00:10:51.776,00:10:52.777,And he's...
00:10:53.569,00:10:54.570,stuck.
00:10:54.654,00:10:56.280,"-Help! -Hang on, buddy."
00:10:58.908,00:11:00.618,"Phew! Thanks, Gabby."
00:11:03.704,00:11:06.540,We'll never catch those guys. I give up.
00:11:06.624,00:11:09.251,No one gives up on Hamster Kitties.
00:11:09.585,00:11:11.504,"That's the spirit, Baby Box!"
00:11:11.587,00:11:15.591,"They are really good sliders, though. I can't keep up."
00:11:15.675,00:11:19.178,I wish we could get them to slide right into my Pandy Pack.
00:11:19.261,00:11:20.679,Maybe we can.
00:11:20.888,00:11:22.723,What if we build a slide?
00:11:22.807,00:11:25.393,"You could wait for them at the end, and..."
00:11:27.478,00:11:29.188,I'm an expert builder.
00:11:29.271,00:11:32.316,I can make a slide out of almost anything.
00:11:32.691,00:11:34.610,Ooh! That gives me an idea.
00:11:37.947,00:11:41.367,How about making a slide out of a super-long noodle?
00:11:41.450,00:11:43.244,"Yeah, I can make it work."
00:11:43.744,00:11:47.748,-Sounds like a noodle-riffic plan to me. -Let's give it a go!
00:12:00.010,00:12:01.887,"Hey, where's Cakey?"
00:12:04.181,00:12:08.060,"Come on, little Hamster Kitties! It's Noodle Slide time!"
00:12:08.352,00:12:10.354,Whee!
00:12:16.527,00:12:19.155,Whee! Wahoo! Yeah!
00:12:20.698,00:12:22.408,Wahoo!
00:12:34.920,00:12:36.088,"Get ready, Pandy!"
00:12:38.424,00:12:39.425,Whoop!
00:12:39.508,00:12:42.344,-Pandy makes the big catch! Yeah! -Wahoo!
00:12:42.428,00:12:44.013,Great job!
00:12:46.265,00:12:48.684,Let's see what the little cuties have to say.
00:12:50.769,00:12:52.521,"You heard it here, folks."
00:12:57.109,00:13:02.114,Love to slide. There.
00:13:05.784,00:13:08.954,"Alright, sports fans, we need your help."
00:13:09.330,00:13:11.457,Do you see the last two Hamster Kitties?
00:13:13.501,00:13:14.835,They're in the bedroom!
00:13:15.294,00:13:17.379,"Come on, Gabby! We've got to go!"
00:13:17.463,00:13:19.423,"Until next time, folks."
00:13:19.924,00:13:21.634,"Bye, Hamster Kitties!"
00:13:44.698,00:13:46.534,Silly Hamster Kitties.
00:13:48.869,00:13:51.163,We'd better wake her up and see what's going on.
00:13:51.497,00:13:55.209,"Everybody say, Oh, Pillow Cat!"
00:14:03.676,00:14:05.427,"Hi, guys! What's up?"
00:14:06.053,00:14:07.763,"Besides me, of course!"
00:14:08.180,00:14:11.517,We're looking for two Hamster Kitties? Have you seen them?
00:14:11.767,00:14:12.768,Kind of.
00:14:13.102,00:14:20.067,"I was just having the silliest dream, and it was all about Hamster Kitties."
00:14:22.695,00:14:24.697,They were so cute.
00:14:25.197,00:14:27.449,You've got to tell us the story of that dream.
00:14:27.533,00:14:29.952,"Of course! Everybody, coodle up!"
00:14:31.954,00:14:38.210,"In my dream, the Hamster Kitties and I were jumping up and down on the bed."
00:14:38.294,00:14:43.424,"But the Hamster Kitties bounced so high, they went up into the clouds!"
00:14:46.135,00:14:49.305,All that bouncing must have tired the little fluffers out...
00:14:50.347,00:14:57.980,because they slid down the rainbow curtains and snuggled up in Gabby's slippers to take a nap.
00:14:58.856,00:14:59.857,The end.
00:15:06.280,00:15:07.781,"Uh, Pillow Cat?"
00:15:10.284,00:15:11.785,That wasn't just a dream.
00:15:11.869,00:15:14.496,You never know when your dreams will come true.
00:15:18.709,00:15:20.044,"In you go, sleepyhead."
00:15:24.757,00:15:28.636,Love a snuggly place to sleep. There.
00:15:35.517,00:15:37.895,But I don't see the last Hamster Kitty.
00:15:46.028,00:15:47.696,We lost him again.
00:15:47.780,00:15:53.118,"Well, we know that tree leads down to the music room, so that's where we'll find him."
00:16:06.924,00:16:08.175,DJ Catnip!
00:16:08.550,00:16:11.011,"Hey, cats and kittens! What's shaking?"
00:16:12.513,00:16:14.348,We're looking for Hamster Kitties.
00:16:14.431,00:16:17.434,And we know the last one is around here somewhere.
00:16:17.518,00:16:20.938,We've been chasing these little guys all over the Dollhouse.
00:16:25.109,00:16:26.860,"Great idea, Pandy."
00:16:52.720,00:16:54.847,We got all six Hamster Kitties!
00:16:54.930,00:16:56.932,-Wahoo! -Yeah! We did it!
00:16:57.016,00:16:58.142,Alright!
00:16:58.350,00:17:00.185,That was a-meow-zing!
00:17:00.269,00:17:05.733,Hamster Kitties love music. There.
00:17:09.778,00:17:13.157,"Welcome back, you little fluffer-nutters."
00:17:13.240,00:17:15.576,Let's get these guys back to the craft room.
00:17:15.784,00:17:18.454,"Thanks, DJ Catnip. Boop!"
00:17:18.620,00:17:20.289,"Anytime, kitty-cats!"
00:17:39.600,00:17:43.437,"Mama Box, we found all the Hamster Kitties!"
00:17:45.522,00:17:48.192,"Oh, yay! I knew you could do it."
00:17:48.275,00:17:52.029,"It was tough, but Baby Box never gave up."
00:17:52.112,00:17:55.449,"Yeah, no one gives up on Hamster Kitties."
00:17:55.866,00:17:57.284,I've got an idea!
00:17:57.451,00:17:58.869,"Come on, guys."
00:17:59.912,00:18:01.371,I'll be right back.
00:18:03.082,00:18:07.127,That's my Baby Box. She really knows how to get things done.
00:18:07.211,00:18:10.255,And rounding up these little guys was not easy.
00:18:10.339,00:18:13.133,But all our hard work was definitely worth it.
00:18:18.764,00:18:20.307,In you go.
00:18:20.390,00:18:25.562,I made a home for the Hamster Kitties with all the things they love.
00:18:44.790,00:18:48.210,"They love a nice, cozy place to snuggle up and sleep."
00:18:50.963,00:18:53.215,"Oh, and they love music."
00:18:56.760,00:18:59.138,I'm a Hamster Kitty expert now!
00:18:59.388,00:19:01.348,Wow! You sure are.
00:19:02.182,00:19:06.562,Aww. I think you've made the perfect home for these fluffy little guys.
00:19:11.108,00:19:12.943,Yay!
00:19:13.360,00:19:15.863,"Did you hear that, you little fluffer-nutters?"
00:19:15.946,00:19:17.865,This is your new home.
00:19:20.159,00:19:21.285,Yeah!
00:19:21.493,00:19:24.955,"Thank you, Mama! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
00:19:27.791,00:19:29.793,"Oh, that's so cute!"
00:19:30.127,00:19:32.671,The Hamster Kitties have a great new home.
00:19:32.754,00:19:35.841,"I'm so excited for them, and for Baby Box."
00:19:36.508,00:19:39.303,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:19:54.693,00:19:55.694,It's me!
00:19:57.154,00:19:58.614,Baby Box!
00:20:02.201,00:20:03.202,Hi!
00:20:05.120,00:20:07.289,Aren't these Hamster Kitties so cute?
00:20:07.372,00:20:13.754,I'm gonna show you how to make your very own craft Hamster Kitty to live at home with you.
00:20:17.132,00:20:21.220,"A big, fuzzy pompom for the Hamster Kitty body."
00:20:24.264,00:20:26.934,Tiny pompom balls for the hands and feet.
00:20:27.726,00:20:32.314,"Felt or fabric to cut out their nose, mouth and ears."
00:20:32.940,00:20:35.776,"Scissors, and our trusty glue."
00:20:36.401,00:20:38.111,Let's get started.
00:20:38.195,00:20:42.407,"First, we need the big, fluffy pompom for the body."
00:20:46.036,00:20:47.371,"Thanks, little buddy."
00:20:47.579,00:20:50.999,Now let's glue on the googly eyes.
00:20:51.375,00:20:53.877,Just one drop on each eye.
00:20:54.086,00:20:55.087,"Boop, boop."
00:20:55.671,00:20:57.172,Then stick them on.
00:21:05.264,00:21:07.766,"Boop, boop. Boop, boop."
00:21:18.402,00:21:20.028,Two little triangles.
00:21:23.490,00:21:28.829,We need a teeny triangle for the cute Hamster Kitty nose.
00:21:33.083,00:21:34.918,I'm gonna cut out the mouth.
00:21:37.212,00:21:38.297,Cutty-cutty!
00:21:42.426,00:21:45.721,Great! Now let's glue these pieces on.
00:21:51.059,00:21:52.519,Boop. Boop.
00:21:58.900,00:22:00.444,-Boop. -Boop.
00:22:04.281,00:22:06.533,Our Hamster Kitty is finished!
00:22:08.702,00:22:13.874,Have a crafty-riffic time making your own Hamster Kitty. Bye!
00:22:22.049,00:22:23.842,Pets really are the best.
00:22:23.925,00:22:26.136,"Right, Floyd? I love you."
00:22:26.345,00:22:27.471,"Yes, I do."
00:22:27.554,00:22:29.931,Can you hear him? He's purring!
00:22:30.015,00:22:31.433,Such a good kitty.
00:22:32.976,00:22:35.020,Thanks for playing in the Dollhouse with me.
00:00:48.047,00:00:51.176,Oh. Hey. Pandy and I are playing hide-and-seek.
00:00:51.259,00:00:54.179,We love this game. Do you want to help me find him?
00:00:54.763,00:00:55.764,Come on.
00:00:58.099,00:01:07.984,"Pandy is a stuffed animal with a big, white head, two pointy ears with pink inside, and one of the ears has a black tip."
00:01:08.526,00:01:09.527,Do you see him?
00:01:14.699,00:01:19.245,"We found him! Good job. I'm glad I always find you, Pandy."
00:01:20.872,00:01:23.166,Ooh! You know what that sound means.
00:01:23.249,00:01:25.543,It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery!
00:01:25.710,00:01:27.462,"Come on, Pandy. Let's go."
00:01:38.640,00:01:42.227,"OK, let's see what we have in our Meow Meow Mailbox today."
00:01:44.354,00:01:46.397,Ooh!
00:01:48.483,00:01:52.362,Look at this! Look at all those game pieces.
00:01:53.196,00:01:58.243,"They're all over the top and the bottom. And look, checkers and cards."
00:01:58.868,00:02:01.371,I wonder what it means. Let's see.
00:02:06.960,00:02:09.879,It's a game spinner shaped like the Dollhouse.
00:02:10.171,00:02:12.590,"Look, it even spins, too."
00:02:12.674,00:02:14.634,All those colorful lights.
00:02:14.717,00:02:16.761,I love all the glitter on this.
00:02:17.095,00:02:21.432,"Oh, there's even little drawings for each of the rooms of the Dollhouse."
00:02:22.183,00:02:25.562,I know what this means. It's game day in the Dollhouse!
00:02:25.645,00:02:26.646,Come on.
00:02:28.398,00:02:31.776,Let's spin the spinner to see where we'll play our first game.
00:02:41.578,00:02:42.704,Where did it land?
00:02:47.709,00:02:49.502,Let's go play some games.
00:02:50.962,00:02:57.844,"With these magical cat ears, I can shrink down and play with the Gabby Cats inside my Dollhouse."
00:02:58.761,00:03:00.305,Time to get tiny.
00:03:09.188,00:03:10.857,Whee!
00:03:11.858,00:03:13.985,What are you waiting for? Come on in!
00:03:16.529,00:03:18.531,Welcome to my Dollhouse!
00:03:18.990,00:03:22.243,Whoa! Look at how big our game spinner is.
00:03:23.870,00:03:27.165,It's The Gabby Cats Game Show!
00:03:27.373,00:03:31.419,"And I'm your cat-tacular host, CatRat!"
00:03:32.837,00:03:36.132,"We've got lots of games to play, so let's not waste any time."
00:03:41.387,00:03:42.513,"Hi, everybody!"
00:03:42.597,00:03:44.265,"Yay, Baby Box!"
00:03:44.349,00:03:47.810,Our first game is a little something I like to call...
00:03:48.019,00:03:51.648,"Red, Loud, and Smelly!"
00:03:53.441,00:03:55.944,Good smelly or bad smelly?
00:03:57.737,00:04:03.034,"Inside one of these holes is something that's red, loud, and smelly."
00:04:03.284,00:04:08.414,"Once you find it, hit the button on top of this buzzer before time runs out."
00:04:18.883,00:04:20.593,I'll go first! I'll go first!
00:04:20.885,00:04:22.470,"You'll help us play, right?"
00:04:23.721,00:04:24.555,Great!
00:04:25.932,00:04:26.933,Hyah!
00:04:27.267,00:04:28.268,I got something!
00:04:28.559,00:04:29.769,Is it red?
00:04:31.354,00:04:32.188,Yep.
00:04:33.398,00:04:34.440,Is it loud?
00:04:36.442,00:04:37.277,Nope.
00:04:39.821,00:04:40.822,This isn't it.
00:04:41.614,00:04:42.740,I'll go next.
00:04:43.157,00:04:44.158,Hwah!
00:04:44.784,00:04:46.035,Ooh! A whistle!
00:04:46.244,00:04:47.370,Is it red?
00:04:52.959,00:04:54.877,Is it smelly? Smell it!
00:04:56.254,00:04:58.715,Not smelly. Wah-wah.
00:04:59.716,00:05:01.467,We need to keep trying.
00:05:01.843,00:05:02.844,"OK, OK!"
00:05:05.430,00:05:06.681,Here I go!
00:05:09.434,00:05:12.437,"Oh, a robot! And it's red!"
00:05:20.611,00:05:22.071,Not smelly.
00:05:22.155,00:05:24.073,"This isn't it, either."
00:05:24.490,00:05:25.992,Let me give it another try.
00:05:26.701,00:05:27.744,"Go, Pandy!"
00:05:29.912,00:05:30.913,Hyah!
00:05:36.002,00:05:37.587,But is it loud?
00:05:39.380,00:05:41.090,"Nope, it's not loud."
00:05:48.514,00:05:51.476,"Better hurry up there, gang. Time is running out."
00:05:51.809,00:05:53.144,"Try again, Pandy."
00:05:57.065,00:05:59.150,"Oh, a garbage truck!"
00:05:59.484,00:06:00.651,Is it red?
00:06:09.452,00:06:13.081,"Red, loud, and smelly! We found it!"
00:06:18.461,00:06:19.462,Yes!
00:06:19.754,00:06:21.798,And here come your tickets.
00:06:25.760,00:06:27.220,I love tickets!
00:06:27.386,00:06:28.971,"That's right, Pandy."
00:06:29.055,00:06:32.558,"Every time you win a game, you collect tickets."
00:06:32.809,00:06:38.606,"If you collect enough tickets at the end of the show, you get to pick out a prize!"
00:06:38.773,00:06:40.900,Tickets and prizes?
00:06:40.983,00:06:44.320,This is the most paw-tastic day ever!
00:06:46.864,00:06:48.991,Let's see where we're going next.
00:06:49.158,00:06:52.036,"OK, gang, it's time to..."
00:06:52.120,00:06:55.164,spin that spinner!
00:06:55.248,00:06:56.541,Say it with me.
00:07:11.139,00:07:12.431,Let's go!
00:07:14.142,00:07:15.268,Good luck!
00:07:25.528,00:07:31.784,"And to help you with this game, please give a big Gabby Cats welcome to the Sergeant of Sweets..."
00:07:32.034,00:07:33.244,Cakey!
00:07:35.955,00:07:38.666,"Hi, guys! I'm so excited!"
00:07:47.425,00:07:49.510,"Ooh, I love sundaes!"
00:07:49.594,00:07:50.970,"Me, too, Pandy."
00:07:51.053,00:07:54.599,Especially when they're made with my favorite ingredients.
00:07:55.057,00:07:59.604,"Ice cream, pickles, peppers, and sardines!"
00:07:59.687,00:08:01.647,Ew! If he likes it...
00:08:02.648,00:08:03.649,Whoa!
00:08:03.983,00:08:06.569,Look at the size of this sundae glass.
00:08:09.113,00:08:16.704,"Because to win this game, you have to make the sundae as tall as this red line."
00:08:17.622,00:08:19.790,I'm an expert at making sundaes.
00:08:24.253,00:08:26.923,"You see that big balloon above you? Oh, yeah."
00:08:27.173,00:08:30.927,"It's filling up, as we speak, with whipped cream!"
00:08:31.010,00:08:32.887,If you can't finish in time...
00:08:33.346,00:08:35.681,whipped cream shower!
00:08:36.182,00:08:40.520,"All right. Ready, set, sundae!"
00:08:43.773,00:08:44.899,Ice cream.
00:08:45.066,00:08:46.108,Pickles.
00:08:46.192,00:08:47.276,Peppers.
00:08:47.443,00:08:48.569,Sardines.
00:08:49.278,00:08:50.530,Say it with us.
00:08:50.738,00:08:51.781,Ice cream.
00:08:52.406,00:08:53.407,Pickles.
00:08:53.699,00:08:54.700,Peppers.
00:08:54.867,00:08:56.077,Sardines.
00:08:57.787,00:08:58.788,Pickles.
00:09:00.122,00:09:01.415,What comes next?
00:09:03.167,00:09:04.377,Sardines.
00:09:11.300,00:09:12.677,What comes next?
00:09:13.970,00:09:14.971,Peppers.
00:09:15.054,00:09:15.888,Sardines.
00:09:17.431,00:09:18.558,Better hurry!
00:09:22.728,00:09:24.146,"I got this, I got this!"
00:09:24.522,00:09:25.940,"Pickles. Then, wait, no..."
00:09:26.023,00:09:29.235,"Pickles, ice cream, peppers, pickles."
00:09:34.115,00:09:35.950,It's gonna blow!
00:09:44.709,00:09:46.252,"Oh, sprinkles!"
00:09:46.752,00:09:48.879,We didn't win any more tickets.
00:09:48.963,00:09:50.298,"It's OK, Pandy."
00:09:50.381,00:09:55.678,We didn't win any more tickets... yet. But there's still more games to play.
00:09:55.845,00:09:58.055,And you get to keep the whipped cream!
00:09:58.222,00:10:02.184,"I have to say, of all the things that have fallen on our heads..."
00:10:02.727,00:10:05.104,this is the most delicious.
00:10:05.313,00:10:11.360,"OK, gang, it's time to... spin that spinner!"
00:10:11.444,00:10:12.737,Say it with me.
00:10:17.867,00:10:19.201,"Go for it, Cakey!"
00:10:19.285,00:10:20.786,"Thanks, Gabby."
00:10:38.262,00:10:41.724,And we'll see you in the Bathroom!
00:10:41.807,00:10:42.808,Let's go!
00:10:43.726,00:10:44.769,Good luck!
00:10:44.894,00:10:46.520,Cakey's rooting for you!
00:10:50.316,00:10:57.823,"All right, contestants, I know that last game didn't quite go your way, but are you ready for your next challenge?"
00:10:58.157,00:10:59.367,Never been readier.
00:11:00.534,00:11:05.039,Then let's say hello to the gal who puts sparkle in science!
00:11:05.122,00:11:07.291,MerCat!
00:11:10.086,00:11:12.254,Wow! What an entrance!
00:11:12.505,00:11:15.925,"So, let's get ready to play our next game."
00:11:16.133,00:11:18.928,Ducks in a Tub!
00:11:34.944,00:11:36.237,I'll go first.
00:11:36.320,00:11:42.076,"On your marks, get set, match those ducks!"
00:11:42.368,00:11:43.911,Help me find a match.
00:11:46.080,00:11:49.291,Let's try for the circles. Take a good look.
00:11:51.961,00:11:54.296,"OK, I'll start with the pink one."
00:11:56.173,00:11:57.383,A circle.
00:11:57.758,00:11:59.802,Where was the other circle duck?
00:12:09.770,00:12:11.856,We have our first match!
00:12:13.232,00:12:14.525,Nicely done.
00:12:14.650,00:12:15.901,"Your turn, Pandy."
00:12:20.197,00:12:22.366,Try and remember where the triangles are.
00:12:27.288,00:12:29.582,I remember the yellow one was a triangle.
00:12:31.917,00:12:33.043,Yes!
00:12:33.669,00:12:36.630,Uh-oh. Where was the other triangle?
00:12:38.382,00:12:39.675,The orange duck!
00:12:41.635,00:12:43.512,Yes! Two triangles.
00:12:47.600,00:12:50.060,"Oh, yeah! We got a match!"
00:12:54.064,00:12:55.107,You did it!
00:12:55.316,00:12:56.775,"All right, MerCat."
00:12:56.901,00:13:00.446,You need one more match to win. And you're up!
00:13:00.529,00:13:04.575,Phew! This is a lot of pressure. I'm gonna need your help.
00:13:05.201,00:13:06.911,Look at where the shapes are.
00:13:09.955,00:13:12.500,"OK, little red buddy, let's start with you."
00:13:20.925,00:13:22.051,Purple!
00:13:23.719,00:13:26.138,Two squares! They're a match!
00:13:30.809,00:13:33.145,We did it! We won the game!
00:13:35.272,00:13:36.565,"Quick, hit the buzzer!"
00:13:39.485,00:13:41.028,You're a winner!
00:13:41.111,00:13:43.364,"And, Pandy, look what's coming!"
00:13:47.159,00:13:49.411,"Come on, tickets! Come to Pandy!"
00:13:49.787,00:13:51.747,Look at all these tickets!
00:13:51.956,00:13:55.417,I think we're definitely gonna have enough tickets to win a prize.
00:13:58.921,00:14:02.883,It's time to... spin that spinner!
00:14:03.008,00:14:04.301,Say it with me.
00:14:19.525,00:14:20.693,"Thanks, MerCat!"
00:14:21.235,00:14:22.903,"Yeah, thanks, MerCat."
00:14:23.112,00:14:24.572,You were the bubbles.
00:14:37.376,00:14:40.921,It's time for our final game...
00:14:41.005,00:14:42.756,Tushy Tunes!
00:14:44.592,00:14:46.343,"Oh, I don't want to lose!"
00:14:46.635,00:14:49.847,"We might lose, but we also might win."
00:14:50.014,00:14:51.223,Let's just play.
00:14:51.432,00:14:56.228,Please give a big Gabby Cats welcome to our special guest tushy...
00:14:56.478,00:14:58.814,DJ Catnip!
00:15:01.066,00:15:02.192,"Hi, everybody!"
00:15:04.987,00:15:10.951,"OK, the music couch will play a pattern, and you have to play the pattern back..."
00:15:11.243,00:15:13.203,with your tushies!
00:15:13.746,00:15:16.248,"Whoo! Man, I love this game!"
00:15:16.457,00:15:17.541,I'll go first!
00:15:19.501,00:15:21.128,Got to warm up my tushy.
00:15:22.421,00:15:25.633,"All right, Pandy, let's start the timer."
00:15:29.637,00:15:33.182,"Now, here's your first Tushy Tune!"
00:15:37.353,00:15:38.562,Sing it with me.
00:15:42.942,00:15:44.944,Uh... What comes next?
00:15:46.695,00:15:47.529,Blue!
00:15:50.950,00:15:52.534,"Yeah, great job!"
00:15:52.701,00:15:53.577,Thanks.
00:15:55.162,00:15:58.248,"OK, now this gets a little harder."
00:15:58.999,00:16:01.669,"I'm ready, I'm ready! Come on, y'all, let's get it!"
00:16:07.466,00:16:09.677,"Come on, kitty cats, we got this."
00:16:16.058,00:16:17.184,What's next?
00:16:22.982,00:16:24.441,"Great job, DJ!"
00:16:24.775,00:16:27.236,Only one Tushy Tune left.
00:16:27.444,00:16:29.613,But it's the hardest one.
00:16:29.863,00:16:31.657,"Gabby, you're up."
00:16:31.949,00:16:34.576,"I don't know if I can do it, but..."
00:16:49.675,00:16:50.759,Sing it with me!
00:16:57.016,00:16:58.392,What comes next?
00:17:01.437,00:17:02.438,Then?
00:17:07.401,00:17:08.235,-Yes! -Yay!
00:17:08.318,00:17:09.862,-We did it again! -We did it!
00:17:11.822,00:17:13.907,"-The timer! -Pandy, quick!"
00:17:19.329,00:17:20.831,"Oh, tickets!"
00:17:29.381,00:17:32.426,OK. The moment of truth.
00:17:32.509,00:17:36.013,"As you feed the tickets in, the glitter will rise."
00:17:39.266,00:17:43.479,"...you, my friends, will get to pick out a prize!"
00:17:43.562,00:17:44.730,Wahoo!

00:18:43.580,00:18:46.708,I'm gonna draw a blueberry pie with this.
00:18:48.293,00:18:51.797,Hmm. I'll take that adorable little kitty timer!

00:19:00.514,00:19:01.515,MerCat?
00:19:02.349,00:19:04.476,Those shades are definitely me.
00:19:07.646,00:19:08.772,How do they look?
00:19:12.234,00:19:15.404,"-What can I get you, Catnip? -Oh, a harmonica!"
00:19:20.701,00:19:21.952,Whoo! I love it!
00:19:22.202,00:19:24.037,"What's it gonna be, Gabby?"
00:19:24.121,00:19:26.331,I'll take that cute little cat toy.
00:19:31.920,00:19:33.881,Floyd is gonna love this.
00:19:34.131,00:19:35.382,"All right, Pandy."
00:19:35.465,00:19:37.676,You worked really hard today.
00:19:37.801,00:19:40.012,What prize are you gonna pick?
00:19:43.265,00:19:44.474,"Oh, I know!"

00:19:50.272,00:19:52.065,It's so shiny.
00:19:57.154,00:20:00.115,"CatRat, I want to give this trophy to you."
00:20:00.365,00:20:01.450,Really?
00:20:01.658,00:20:04.536,For being the best game show host ever.
00:20:04.620,00:20:06.205,"Thanks, Pandy!"
00:20:06.955,00:20:08.832,I guess shiny is miney.
00:20:10.167,00:20:13.212,"Aw, Pandy, that was so sweet."
00:20:13.420,00:20:15.047,You guys are the best.
00:20:16.506,00:20:18.467,I love playing games with you.

00:20:35.901,00:20:38.278,"It's me, CatRat."
00:20:40.948,00:20:46.036,There are so many things that make me the most cat-mazing of all the Gabby Cats.
00:22:23.050,00:22:24.968,I just love that CatRat.
00:22:25.344,00:22:27.804,"And I love you, too, Floyd. Yeah."
00:22:27.888,00:22:29.139,Look what I won for you.
00:22:32.517,00:22:35.854,"See you next time, and we'll open another Dollhouse surprise!"
00:00:48.798,00:00:52.260,"Oh, hey. I was just about to give Pandy a checkup."
00:00:52.802,00:00:55.221,"OK, Pandy, take a deep breath."
00:00:57.015,00:00:58.057,Now breathe out.
00:01:00.810,00:01:01.644,Good news.
00:01:09.402,00:01:11.488,You know what that sound means.
00:01:11.571,00:01:14.407,It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery!
00:01:14.699,00:01:15.700,Come on.
00:01:26.795,00:01:30.799,"OK, let's see what our Meow Meow Mailbox has for us today."
00:01:32.884,00:01:34.969,Whoa! Look!
00:01:45.063,00:01:46.064,Let's open it.
00:01:50.235,00:01:51.820,Whoa!
00:01:54.823,00:01:56.032,Should we crank it?
00:01:58.910,00:02:00.245,All right.
00:02:09.629,00:02:11.548,It's a miniature cat-in-the-box!
00:02:12.632,00:02:14.425,You know who loves surprises?
00:02:14.926,00:02:16.845,Cakey! Let's go show him.
00:02:19.055,00:02:20.932,This is my Dollhouse.
00:02:25.311,00:02:27.313,Cakey loves surprises the most.
00:02:28.940,00:02:32.986,I can't wait to get in the Dollhouse to show him the cat-in-the-box.
00:02:33.486,00:02:34.946,He's gonna love it.
00:02:37.031,00:02:44.122,"With these magical cat ears, I can shrink down and play with the Gabby Cats inside my Dollhouse."
00:02:44.831,00:02:46.374,Time to get tiny!
00:02:55.008,00:02:56.384,Whee!
00:02:57.510,00:02:58.720,"Hey, come on in!"
00:03:01.639,00:03:03.683,Welcome to my Dollhouse.
00:03:03.850,00:03:05.143,Let's find Pandy.
00:03:05.894,00:03:07.020,Do you see him?
00:03:10.732,00:03:12.066,Where is he?
00:03:18.740,00:03:20.867,Don't forget about me!
00:03:21.075,00:03:23.244,Cakey Hug Attack!
00:03:25.079,00:03:27.540,Did I surprise you guys?
00:03:27.624,00:03:29.584,"You sure did, Cakey."
00:03:29.667,00:03:34.339,"Oh, and speaking of surprises, check out the surprise we have for you!"
00:03:34.881,00:03:36.299,I can't wait!
00:03:44.307,00:03:46.684,Ah! That was a good one.
00:03:54.943,00:03:57.904,Uh-oh. That surprise gave me the hiccups!
00:04:00.156,00:04:02.575,Whoa! Those are some hiccups.
00:04:02.742,00:04:03.993,"Don't worry, Gabby."
00:04:05.328,00:04:06.621,A-ha!
00:04:07.664,00:04:11.125,Dr. Pandy will get rid of those hiccups in a jiffy!
00:04:11.292,00:04:14.671,"Oh. Thank you, Dr. Pandy."
00:04:14.754,00:04:16.506,"Now, let's take a listen."
00:04:21.469,00:04:23.805,"Oops! Sorry, Pandy."
00:04:23.888,00:04:26.140,Don't worry. All part of being a doctor.
00:04:27.809,00:04:31.187,"So, Dr. Pandy, do you have a cure for my hiccups?"
00:04:31.271,00:04:34.899,Of course! Dr. Pandy always knows the perfect cure.
00:04:39.487,00:04:41.864,Um... Uh...
00:04:42.657,00:04:46.119,"Psst! Cakey, you got any recipes to cure the hiccups?"
00:04:46.411,00:04:47.662,"Sure, I do!"
00:04:48.288,00:04:52.250,My delicious Snack Smackers cure the hiccups every time.
00:04:52.500,00:04:53.501,Follow me!
00:04:55.378,00:05:07.473,"OK, to make Snack Smackers we need rice cakes, sunflower butter, blueberries, bananas, pretzel sticks..."
00:05:11.602,00:05:12.895,Mm!
00:05:18.234,00:05:20.611,"Oh, yeah! Good stuff."
00:05:29.871,00:05:34.250,"Next, use your blueberries to make cute kitty-cat eyes and a nose."
00:05:34.542,00:05:35.585,"Boop, boop, boop."
00:05:38.588,00:05:39.422,Boop.
00:05:44.594,00:05:45.720,"Boop, boop."
00:05:47.346,00:05:49.223,-Boop. -Pandy!
00:05:53.144,00:05:54.437,"Boop, boop."
00:05:54.645,00:05:57.273,Don't forget the yummy strawberry mouth.
00:05:57.565,00:05:58.399,Boop.
00:06:01.194,00:06:02.028,Boop.
00:06:15.666,00:06:17.043,And ta-da!
00:06:19.670,00:06:21.339,"What do you think, Dr. Pandy?"
00:06:21.631,00:06:23.841,My medical recommendation is...
00:06:24.050,00:06:25.802,let's get smacking!
00:06:26.010,00:06:28.888,"All right, let's hope this cures the hiccups."
00:06:29.305,00:06:30.389,Here I go.
00:06:35.103,00:06:37.647,"So, Gabby, are your hiccups gone?"
00:06:37.730,00:06:39.148,Hmm. Let's see.
00:06:42.819,00:06:43.820,Nope.
00:06:43.903,00:06:46.072,My Snack Smackers didn't work?
00:06:46.447,00:06:48.074,But they always work!
00:06:49.534,00:06:52.245,Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
00:06:52.328,00:06:53.704,"Aw, Cakey..."
00:06:53.913,00:06:58.376,"You didn't cure my hiccups, but you did give our tummies some yummies."
00:07:01.671,00:07:03.214,Group hug!
00:07:05.133,00:07:08.761,"OK, Dr. Pandy, what should we try next?"
00:07:08.928,00:07:12.181,"Well, as your doctor, I recommend we..."
00:07:12.348,00:07:13.349,Uh...
00:07:15.393,00:07:17.520,I recommend a visit with MerCat.
00:07:17.687,00:07:19.647,"Great idea, Dr. Pandy."
00:07:19.730,00:07:24.318,"With all those lotions and potions, I'm sure she'll have something to cure the hiccups."
00:07:24.402,00:07:26.446,To the Bathroom!
00:07:29.782,00:07:30.992,Good luck!
00:07:34.579,00:07:38.458,What's all that shaking? You know how hard it is to do anything when you're...?
00:07:40.168,00:07:41.878,"Oh. Hi, CatRat."
00:07:42.295,00:07:46.257,That was just Gabby. She has a really big case of the hiccups.
00:07:48.050,00:07:49.051,Yeah.
00:07:49.719,00:07:52.722,That cat-in-the-box surprise gave her the hiccups.
00:07:56.851,00:08:03.149,"You know, I, CatRat, know the best, no-fail, works-every-time cure for the hiccups."
00:08:06.861,00:08:09.322,CatRat has all the answers.
00:08:09.405,00:08:10.698,When will they learn?
00:08:14.577,00:08:17.997,"As usual, I'm just gonna have to take this one into my own paws."
00:08:18.080,00:08:19.207,Hmm. Yoink!
00:08:25.171,00:08:27.048,"MerCat, we need your help."
00:08:28.508,00:08:30.301,Shimmering sea scales!
00:08:30.384,00:08:33.179,"Gabby, those are some humongous hiccups!"
00:08:33.387,00:08:34.680,That's why we're here.
00:08:34.764,00:08:36.807,We were hoping that you had a cure?
00:08:42.438,00:08:43.439,Follow me.
00:08:46.692,00:08:51.030,"OK, let's try my upside-down glowing globules cure."
00:08:51.113,00:08:53.616,"Ah, yes, glowing globules."
00:08:59.580,00:09:02.625,"OK, Gabby. Step one: Put these on."
00:09:06.295,00:09:07.338,And these.
00:09:08.339,00:09:10.049,Ooh! Stylish.
00:09:11.384,00:09:12.552,And comfy!
00:09:12.635,00:09:13.928,And now...
00:09:18.266,00:09:21.644,We have some glowing globules for your boots!
00:09:22.144,00:09:23.521,Some glimmering green.
00:09:24.063,00:09:25.898,A little purr-ific purple.
00:09:26.482,00:09:27.984,And paw-tastic pink.
00:09:28.901,00:09:31.112,So cool and so globby!
00:09:32.780,00:09:35.616,"OK, here comes the best part."
00:09:35.700,00:09:38.286,Are you ready for the glow?
00:09:50.172,00:09:51.465,Whoa!
00:09:52.508,00:09:54.176,You've got to be kitten me!
00:09:54.260,00:09:57.805,This is almost the most cat-tastic thing ever!
00:09:57.888,00:09:58.889,Almost?
00:09:58.973,00:10:01.684,You're hanging upside down in glowing globby boots!
00:10:06.230,00:10:07.356,Whoa!
00:10:07.565,00:10:10.568,"-Got to match my boots! -I like your style, Gabby."
00:10:15.489,00:10:16.616,And I love it!
00:10:16.824,00:10:22.622,"OK, you're gonna blow the biggest bubble you've ever made in your life, and your hiccups are gonna be cured!"
00:10:25.625,00:10:30.504,A little bigger. Little bigger. You're almost there. Almost there!
00:10:39.430,00:10:43.351,I can't believe that didn't work! My Spa Science never fails.
00:10:43.434,00:10:46.562,"MerCat, you can't call that a fail."
00:10:46.771,00:10:51.817,I got to float upside down in glowing globby boots!
00:10:51.901,00:10:55.363,"-That was a-meow-zing! -Well, I'm glad you liked it."
00:10:55.696,00:10:58.741,We'll just keep looking for a cure for my hiccups.
00:10:58.908,00:11:02.119,"So, Dr. Pandy, what should we try next?"
00:11:02.203,00:11:03.954,Hmm. Let's see.
00:11:08.167,00:11:11.879,I recommend we head up to The Fairy Tail Garden to consult with Kitty Fairy.
00:11:12.505,00:11:13.673,Let's move!
00:11:18.344,00:11:19.345,Oops!
00:11:21.597,00:11:22.640,"Thanks, MerCat!"
00:11:28.145,00:11:29.897,Hello. Where's Gabby?
00:11:31.607,00:11:33.818,She's on her way up to The Fairy Tail Garden.
00:11:34.068,00:11:37.405,She has got a really bad case of the hiccups.
00:11:37.488,00:11:39.990,I know. That's why I'm trying to find her.
00:11:48.916,00:11:49.959,"Hey, Kitty Fairy."
00:11:50.042,00:11:51.377,"Oh, hey, you two!"
00:11:53.671,00:11:56.841,"Whoa, Gabby! Those are some hiccups."
00:11:56.924,00:12:00.261,That's why we're here. We're on a search for a hiccup cure.
00:12:00.344,00:12:04.557,You've come to the right place. I have the perfect cure for hiccups.
00:12:04.974,00:12:08.185,What you need is a little Garden magic.
00:12:09.770,00:12:14.316,"Now, there's a very simple Kitty Fairy cure to make your hiccups grow away."
00:12:14.400,00:12:16.610,Don't you mean go away?
00:12:16.694,00:12:18.904,"Oh, no, I mean grow away."
00:12:19.113,00:12:22.491,"To get rid of your hiccups, we just have to plant them in the ground."
00:12:22.575,00:12:24.452,You can plant a hiccup?
00:12:25.077,00:12:26.245,Did you know this?
00:12:26.954,00:12:27.955,Me neither.
00:12:28.038,00:12:31.167,"Yeah, I knew that. I'm a doctor!"
00:12:31.417,00:12:32.501,Follow me!
00:12:37.381,00:12:41.469,Do you remember when poor Cakey had that really bad case of the sneezes?
00:12:41.677,00:12:48.350,"Well, I planted one of his sneezes, grew this Sneezing Sunflower, and Cakey was cured!"
00:12:59.987,00:13:03.365,You'll have to excuse the Belching Blossom. He can't help it.
00:13:04.325,00:13:06.327,I love this Garden. Mm.
00:13:06.952,00:13:10.247,"So, for you, Gabby, we'll grow a Hiccup Buttercup."
00:13:10.331,00:13:12.833,Cat-tastic! How do we start?
00:13:12.958,00:13:16.378,"Well, first, we have to catch one of your hiccups."
00:13:18.672,00:13:20.633,"-Gabby, hiccup! -I'll try!"
00:13:26.931,00:13:28.015,Whoa!
00:13:32.853,00:13:35.731,My hiccup is inside this bubble.
00:13:35.981,00:13:38.651,"Kitty Fairy, this is a-meow-zing!"
00:13:38.734,00:13:40.611,"Now, let's plant your hiccup."
00:13:42.196,00:13:44.573,"First, you dig a hole in the soil."
00:13:47.243,00:13:48.953,That soil looks just like dirt.
00:13:49.745,00:13:51.872,"Soil is dirt, Pandy."
00:13:52.039,00:13:54.500,"Oh, yeah, totally. I knew that."
00:13:54.792,00:13:55.793,I was just...
00:13:58.671,00:14:02.758,"Just like a seed, we place the hiccup bubble inside the hole..."
00:14:04.843,00:14:06.845,then we cover it up with the soil.
00:14:10.015,00:14:11.016,There.
00:14:11.850,00:14:15.688,Now we need a little water to help the Hiccup Buttercup grow.
00:14:16.272,00:14:19.441,"And finally, for the magic words!"
00:14:19.525,00:14:23.988,"On the count of three, we'll say, Hiccups, hiccups, grow away."
00:14:24.238,00:14:26.574,"Ready? One, two, three."
00:14:32.621,00:14:33.747,It's working!
00:14:37.710,00:14:38.794,You did it!
00:14:39.211,00:14:41.213,Thank you! Thank you!
00:14:43.674,00:14:45.551,"Oh, no! It didn't work."
00:14:45.634,00:14:48.262,Those bloomin' hiccups are just too strong.
00:14:48.345,00:14:51.140,"That's OK, Kitty Fairy. Thanks for trying."
00:14:51.223,00:14:53.309,You know I'm always here if you need me.
00:14:55.936,00:14:57.730,We'll never figure this out.
00:14:58.147,00:14:59.315,"Pandy, wait up!"
00:14:59.398,00:15:00.649,"Bye, Kitty Fairy."
00:15:00.733,00:15:01.734,Pandy!
00:15:01.817,00:15:02.818,Good luck!
00:15:05.779,00:15:06.780,Pandy!
00:15:09.074,00:15:10.618,"Pandy, what's wrong?"
00:15:11.160,00:15:12.995,Dr. Pandy quits!
00:15:13.078,00:15:14.455,This is impossible!
00:15:19.501,00:15:20.669,"Come on, Pandy."
00:15:20.753,00:15:23.464,You're made of stronger stuffing than this.
00:15:25.507,00:15:29.678,Nope. We've tried everything and we haven't cured your hiccups!
00:15:30.220,00:15:34.141,"Pandy, we haven't cured my hiccups... yet."
00:15:35.517,00:15:41.273,"And, yeah, we've tried a lot of things, but there are still a lot of things we haven't tried."
00:15:43.442,00:15:46.737,"If we stop trying now, we'll never find a cure."
00:15:47.488,00:15:48.364,I know.
00:15:49.573,00:15:53.202,"Hey, with you by my side, I know we can do this."
00:15:53.285,00:15:54.411,Get over here!
00:15:55.579,00:15:58.832,"So, what do you think we should try next, Dr. Pandy?"
00:15:58.916,00:16:02.962,"Hmm. Well, Mama Box usually has good ideas."
00:16:03.045,00:16:05.005,Maybe we should go to the Craft Room.
00:16:05.172,00:16:07.216,"Great thinking, Dr. Pandy!"
00:16:07.341,00:16:08.509,Follow me!
00:16:14.098,00:16:15.516,To the Craft Room!
00:16:16.100,00:16:17.393,Doctor's orders.
00:16:22.106,00:16:23.107,Boo!
00:16:27.820,00:16:29.530,"Well, excuse you!"
00:16:29.863,00:16:32.825,See what I mean? No respect for the CatRat!
00:16:38.247,00:16:40.499,"Hey, Baby Box. Hey, Mama Box."
00:16:41.667,00:16:43.419,"Oh, my! What was that?"
00:16:43.502,00:16:46.296,Gabby has a serious case of the hiccups.
00:16:46.380,00:16:47.965,Ooh. I'd say.
00:16:48.048,00:16:50.259,We were hoping you'd know how to get rid of them.
00:16:50.551,00:16:54.930,"Well, to get rid of hiccups like that, Gabby, you're gonna need a hiccup machine."
00:16:55.639,00:16:58.976,"Ah, the old hiccup machine! I should have known that."
00:16:59.184,00:17:00.644,You have a hiccup machine?
00:17:20.873,00:17:22.207,Ta-da!
00:17:23.375,00:17:25.794,Wow! A-meow-zing!
00:17:26.503,00:17:29.089,Now all we have to do is turn it on.
00:17:41.727,00:17:44.229,"OK, I think that's enough."
00:17:46.774,00:17:49.651,"-How do you feel, Gabby? -That was a blast!"
00:17:49.902,00:17:51.320,Did it cure your hiccups?
00:17:56.575,00:17:57.576,I guess not.
00:17:57.785,00:17:58.827,Oh...
00:18:00.579,00:18:03.332,"It's OK, Mama Box. I like my new hat."
00:18:03.415,00:18:06.043,But it looks like our hiccup machine failed.
00:18:06.126,00:18:09.505,That's what I call failing fantastically!
00:18:09.963,00:18:11.632,Felt good to shake things up.
00:18:14.009,00:18:18.055,"So, what do you think, Dr. Pandy? There's got to be something we haven't tried yet."
00:18:19.598,00:18:23.352,Ooh! I know! We can go back to the Kitchen and have another snack!
00:18:24.520,00:18:28.107,"Going back to the Kitchen, where it all started!"
00:18:28.482,00:18:30.234,"That's brilliant, Pandy!"
00:18:30.442,00:18:31.568,Brilliant!
00:18:31.819,00:18:33.946,"Wait, why is it brilliant? Whoa!"
00:18:34.154,00:18:35.364,Good luck!
00:18:44.331,00:18:45.791,We left it on the counter.
00:18:46.250,00:18:49.169,-Huh. It's not here anymore. -We need your help.
00:18:49.962,00:18:52.005,Where is the cat-in-the-box?
00:18:56.093,00:18:57.678,The Music Room!
00:18:57.761,00:18:58.762,Thanks!
00:19:00.848,00:19:01.974,Here it is!
00:19:09.231,00:19:16.029,"A big surprise gave you the hiccups, so you needed an even bigger surprise to make them go away."
00:19:16.196,00:19:17.656,"Hey, it's so simple!"
00:19:20.075,00:19:21.827,"Hey, you're right!"
00:19:22.035,00:19:25.747,My hiccups... they're finally gone!
00:19:33.380,00:19:35.007,"Aw. Thanks, CatRat."
00:19:35.215,00:19:38.093,It feels so good not to have hiccups anymore.
00:19:38.427,00:19:43.640,You see? It's like I've been telling you. CatRat has all the answers.
00:19:47.019,00:19:49.438,"Yeah, well, you're welcome."
00:19:49.521,00:19:52.858,I don't know how you got scared by this little box in the first place.
00:19:54.568,00:19:56.570,"-Are you OK, CatRat? -I'm fine."
00:19:57.946,00:20:01.366,-Uh-oh! -Now CatRat has the hiccups!
00:20:10.000,00:20:13.128,Dr. Pandy won't give up until your hiccups are gone!
00:20:22.429,00:20:24.640,Thanks for playing in the Dollhouse with me.
00:20:24.723,00:20:27.267,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:20:42.574,00:20:44.034,"It's me, MerCat!"
00:20:46.745,00:20:51.333,"MerCat in the house, about to drop some Spa Science."
00:20:51.583,00:20:52.584,Come on!
00:22:23.759,00:22:27.179,I can't wait to share more Spa Science with you! Bye!
00:22:29.473,00:22:32.809,"Thanks, Dr. Pandy, for helping me find a cure for those hiccups."
00:22:39.775,00:22:40.609,Bye!
