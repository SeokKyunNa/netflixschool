00:05:37.680,00:05:41.200,That one does that sometimes. Hang on.
00:05:42.400,00:05:45.480,There's a little knob in here somewhere.
00:05:47.680,00:05:51.880,Almost the only real thing in there and even that's grown in a Petri dish.
00:05:53.040,00:05:55.200,Thank you.

00:06:51.640,00:06:55.600,They may as well have cut to a war crime! Ah!
00:06:55.720,00:06:57.440,Oi!
00:07:00.840,00:07:04.840,You missed a bit.

00:08:17.520,00:08:23.440,"Each paying their dues like you, hoping to become a Hot Shot."
00:08:32.280,00:08:35.560,That wasn't good.
00:08:35.680,00:08:39.400,That was beyond incredible!
00:08:43.320,00:08:44.680,Yes! Wow!

00:09:36.640,00:09:40.760,Exclusively on Wraith Babes Xl.
00:09:42.960,00:09:45.720,"Hey, what else were you planning to do with that hand?"
00:11:17.880,00:11:22.080,Told him to report to 22 down.
00:11:22.200,00:11:24.280,Told ya!
00:11:24.400,00:11:27.640,"He's gone lemon, the lazy fuck."
00:12:04.600,00:12:06.840,What do you think?
00:12:09.840,00:12:11.560,It's a bit much.
00:12:12.760,00:12:14.280,Yeah.
00:12:21.720,00:12:24.480,thing about my new lifestyle?
00:12:24.600,00:12:26.200,Where do I start?
00:12:26.320,00:12:29.560,"I love choosing my clothes, and I love gold."
00:12:29.680,00:12:33.360,I feel like it really expresses who I really am.
00:12:33.480,00:12:36.720,And I love looking over outside.
00:12:36.840,00:12:39.640,It's so beautiful sometimes I just wish that everyone could see it.
00:12:39.760,00:12:43.200,"Ooh, nice outfit!"
00:12:46.280,00:12:50.880,"is ruthless, so I suppose it's just honesty."
00:12:51.000,00:12:52.560,Ruthless honesty.
00:14:09.080,00:14:11.520,Drying my hands.
00:14:12.640,00:14:13.920,Impressive.
00:14:21.840,00:14:25.200,"Have fun, I mean on the..."

00:14:52.840,00:14:54.600,Dick.
00:16:08.200,00:16:09.360,Detritus.
00:16:09.880,00:16:11.920,Sorry.
00:16:57.320,00:16:59.960,Howie Mandelbrot.

00:17:27.120,00:17:28.680,"Wait, wait, there's a knack to it."
00:17:28.800,00:17:30.080,It'll take your fingers off.
00:17:30.200,00:17:31.480,Trust me.
00:17:35.000,00:17:36.600,Smart.
00:17:39.880,00:17:41.600,Bing Madsen.
00:17:41.720,00:17:43.400,Short for Bingham.
00:17:43.520,00:17:45.200,Abi Khan.
00:17:46.640,00:17:48.880,Short for Abi Khan.
00:17:49.000,00:17:51.280,You're a new person.
00:17:51.400,00:17:53.280,I just went 21 last week.
00:17:53.400,00:17:54.920,I wanted to go to air down.
00:17:55.040,00:17:58.960,My sister's there but ...
00:18:02.600,00:18:05.160,Proper fruit.
00:18:05.280,00:18:09.920,The most natural thing in there's probably grown in a Petri dish.
00:18:11.320,00:18:13.640,Yeah. Worth it though.
00:18:13.760,00:18:15.520,"Yeah, that's the right way around."
00:18:15.640,00:18:19.200,"When you get the cheap, lardy gunk, you end up having to pedal it off."
00:18:19.320,00:18:21.480,"Then you want more sugar, then you're playing catch-up and..."
00:18:21.600,00:18:25.000,I've...I've been there.
00:18:27.120,00:18:29.320,Can't you just use that CBT app?
00:18:29.440,00:18:31.040,What's that?
00:18:31.160,00:18:36.280,This cognitive behavioural thing and it realigns your thinking to pick healthy food.
00:18:36.400,00:18:38.880,Wisps you into it while you sleep.
00:18:40.840,00:18:42.720,"Yeah, I should try that, yeah."
00:18:49.520,00:18:52.000,I liked your singing the other day.
00:18:54.840,00:18:57.840,I was trying to sing so no one could hear me pee.
00:18:57.960,00:18:59.760,I'm not Selma or anything.
00:18:59.880,00:19:04.480,You've got a phenomenal voice.
00:19:07.240,00:19:09.320,You think I'm being cheesy.
00:19:11.480,00:19:17.080,"Right, I am being cheesy but it was beautiful so, you know?"
00:19:17.200,00:19:19.040,Reality's cheesy sometimes.
00:19:19.160,00:19:24.840,"Not often, admittedly, but now..."
00:19:24.960,00:19:26.760,Yeah.
00:19:33.120,00:19:35.000,"Well, thank you."
00:19:39.160,00:19:40.840,It's just noises though.
00:19:40.960,00:19:42.600,Noises in the right order.
00:19:42.720,00:19:44.320,Don't downplay.
00:19:44.440,00:19:45.760,The song's good.
00:19:45.880,00:19:48.560,It's old.
00:19:48.680,00:19:52.920,My mum used to sing it and she learnt it from her mum.
00:19:53.040,00:19:55.000,A hand-me-down.
00:19:57.160,00:19:59.720,Have you thought of trying out for Hot Shot?
00:20:02.640,00:20:03.720,Me?
00:20:03.840,00:20:05.000,Why not?
00:20:05.120,00:20:07.560,Singing in front of Judge Hope.
00:20:07.680,00:20:10.120,"Seriously, I'd be halfway to the afterlife come the chorus."
00:20:10.240,00:20:11.760,"No, you'd walk it."
00:20:11.880,00:20:17.520,don't have that clockage.
00:20:17.640,00:20:19.960,"I mean, it's what, 12 mil just to enter?"
00:20:20.080,00:20:22.320,"What kind of bike time is that, six months?"
00:20:22.440,00:20:24.480,"Yeah, but..."
00:20:24.600,00:20:28.840,I know people save and starve to get on to that stage.
00:20:28.960,00:20:30.600,I know that's what Selma did.
00:20:30.720,00:20:32.880,"Yeah, but..."
00:20:33.000,00:20:34.720,"Yeah, but I'll gift it to you."
00:20:37.120,00:20:39.200,"The full 12, I'll gift it."
00:20:45.480,00:20:47.200,Don't be ridiculous.
00:20:47.320,00:20:48.960,"Seriously, I've got spare."
00:20:49.080,00:20:51.400,You've got 12 mill spare?
00:20:51.520,00:20:53.880,"Well, my brother left it me."
00:20:54.640,00:20:56.840,"Own a channel, does he?"
00:20:56.960,00:20:59.440,"No, he ... he died."
00:21:01.120,00:21:07.760,He ... he died last year so it got transferred to me.
00:21:07.880,00:21:10.800,"Just over six months' worth, but I've kept it."
00:21:13.160,00:21:14.800,Why don't you spend it on you then?
00:21:14.920,00:21:18.160,"And buy what, some new shoes for my dopple to wear?"
00:21:18.280,00:21:21.120,"I don't know, upgrade your MOS."
00:21:21.240,00:21:23.720,Or get a Fat Acts season pass.
00:21:23.840,00:21:27.080,"Buy one of those wall buddies, the new ones."
00:21:27.200,00:21:29.360,They talk to you after shut in and solve your problems.
00:21:29.480,00:21:31.480,They guide your dreams like gurus.
00:21:31.600,00:21:33.800,It's amazing actually what they can do.
00:21:33.920,00:21:37.240,"Yeah, a mirror plug-in that shows me how I look as a werewolf."
00:21:37.360,00:21:38.520,"No, it can be quite fun."
00:21:38.640,00:21:41.600,That's all just stuff.
00:21:41.720,00:21:45.440,"...it's stuff, it's confetti, it's..."
00:21:47.440,00:21:49.320,You've got something real.
00:21:50.680,00:21:52.560,What better to spend it on?
00:21:52.680,00:21:55.880,You heard me singing in a toilet.
00:21:56.600,00:21:58.000,Is that real?
00:21:58.120,00:22:00.160,More than anything that's happened all year.
00:22:04.120,00:22:07.200,I can't take that kind of clockage off someone.
00:22:08.200,00:22:10.280,It's 12 mill.
00:22:11.000,00:22:14.920,Let me do this. Hmm?
00:22:15.040,00:22:19.200,"Well, I..."
00:22:19.320,00:22:22.240,I just want something real to happen.
00:22:23.800,00:22:26.000,Just once.
00:22:28.920,00:22:30.240,I'd mess up.
00:22:30.360,00:22:32.560,You wouldn't and I don't care anyway.
00:22:32.680,00:22:35.360,I'll go with you.
00:22:35.480,00:22:38.480,I'll force you to go.
00:22:39.600,00:22:41.600,It's tomorrow.
00:22:42.880,00:22:44.680,Come on.
00:22:50.320,00:22:52.200,Say yes.
00:22:55.880,00:22:58.440,I'll go as far as to say okay.
00:22:59.720,00:23:02.400,This proves acceptable.
00:23:04.480,00:23:06.520,Thank God for that.
00:23:09.840,00:23:14.160,Walking away now ... you loon.
00:23:15.120,00:23:17.120,I can live with it.
00:23:46.880,00:23:50.240,"Yeah, I'd love to fucking ruin that an' all."
00:24:18.000,00:24:20.120,What?
00:24:20.240,00:24:22.120,15.
00:24:25.240,00:24:27.280,Flipping joke.
00:25:17.240,00:25:21.600,"New from Wraith Babes, the hottest girls in the nastiest situations."
00:25:37.960,00:25:40.240,I can't believe I'm doing this!
00:25:42.920,00:25:45.240,I am doing this.
00:25:47.680,00:25:50.880,I can't be doing this.
00:25:51.000,00:25:54.080,The ticket?
00:25:54.200,00:25:56.720,"It's a lot of pressure to put someone under, you know."
00:25:56.840,00:26:01.000,"I mean, I'm grateful, don't think I'm not grateful, but it's, it's just..."
00:26:01.120,00:26:01.960,You're babbling.
00:26:02.080,00:26:04.000,I'm babbling.
00:26:12.040,00:26:13.640,I made you this.
00:26:16.360,00:26:19.760,"You never get to keep them more than a day, but there it is anyway."
00:26:24.920,00:26:29.840,It folds flat so you can keep him in your waistband.
00:26:33.720,00:26:35.320,Thank you.
00:26:40.080,00:26:42.960,"It's, you know, something."
00:26:43.080,00:26:44.880,Mmm.
00:27:13.600,00:27:15.680,"Face the screen, please."
00:27:19.000,00:27:21.360,And is he your friends and family allocation?
00:27:22.280,00:27:23.920,Yeah.
00:27:24.040,00:27:25.600,"Hand, please."
00:27:26.440,00:27:28.360,Ah!
00:27:28.480,00:27:30.000,"That's not permanent, is it?"
00:27:30.120,00:27:31.400,"Oh no, two months max."
00:27:31.520,00:27:33.760,Round to the right and through the scanner.
00:27:57.640,00:27:59.880,Where do we go now?
00:28:00.000,00:28:02.160,You wait here.
00:28:02.280,00:28:04.000,How long?
00:28:08.040,00:28:09.720,"So, what do we do?"
00:28:09.840,00:28:10.720,I don't know.
00:28:10.840,00:28:12.080,Ah.
00:28:12.200,00:28:14.160,"Hey, hey!"
00:28:18.320,00:28:20.960,"What, with the dark hair?"
00:28:21.080,00:28:22.720,"Yeah, the pretty one."
00:28:22.840,00:28:24.520,"Yep, okay."
00:28:24.640,00:28:26.560,Move.
00:28:26.680,00:28:28.080,They wanna preview you.
00:28:28.200,00:28:29.320,What?
00:28:29.440,00:28:31.000,Preview. Come on.
00:28:31.120,00:28:32.080,He's with me.
00:28:32.200,00:28:34.000,Hand.
00:28:34.120,00:28:36.600,Show me your hand.
00:28:36.720,00:28:38.120,"Okay, you too."
00:28:38.240,00:28:40.120,That's not fair.
00:28:40.240,00:28:41.800,I don't pick the order.
00:28:41.920,00:28:44.240,I've waited here all week and she's just walked in!
00:28:44.360,00:28:46.280,Everyone will get seen eventually.
00:28:46.400,00:28:48.280,I don't pick the order!
00:28:48.400,00:28:50.600,But I'm a good singer!
00:28:50.720,00:28:52.520,I'm a good singer I am!
00:28:52.640,00:28:53.560,Stand aside.
00:28:53.680,00:28:55.720,It's not fair!
00:28:55.840,00:28:58.000,It's not fair!
00:29:02.600,00:29:04.560,Next lot.
00:29:09.440,00:29:12.120,Would you like to be as big as Selma one day?
00:29:12.720,00:29:14.120,"Um, yeah."
00:29:14.240,00:29:15.720,"I, I, I mean, yeah, I suppose so."
00:29:15.840,00:29:19.800,Could you say that as a self-contained sentence into that screen?
00:29:22.320,00:29:24.280,I guess I'd like to be as big as Selma one day.
00:29:24.400,00:29:26.680,proceed to stage area.
00:29:26.800,00:29:28.840,We're done?
00:29:31.200,00:29:32.400,Both performing?
00:29:32.520,00:29:33.520,Just her.
00:29:33.640,00:29:34.920,Okay. And what are you?
00:29:35.040,00:29:36.080,Singer.
00:29:36.200,00:29:37.560,Compliance.
00:29:37.680,00:29:39.080,"No, thanks."
00:29:39.200,00:29:41.320,"Yes, thanks! It's compulsory for all contestants."
00:29:41.440,00:29:43.920,And more to the point it'll stop you puking with nerves.
00:29:44.040,00:29:45.200,She's got to perform?
00:29:45.320,00:29:46.480,"Well, uhm!"
00:29:46.600,00:29:49.200,"Look, just sip it!"
00:29:52.200,00:29:53.720,Oh.
00:29:53.840,00:29:55.920,"Yeah, it's just a touch of light foam. It'll pass."
00:29:56.040,00:29:57.400,"Well, make the most of it!"
00:29:57.520,00:29:59.120,"I mean, you can't get this stuff anywhere else!"
00:29:59.240,00:30:00.280,You okay?
00:30:00.400,00:30:01.120,Yeah.
00:30:01.240,00:30:02.960,You okay?
00:30:04.400,00:30:07.120,"Yeah, just..."
00:30:07.240,00:30:10.320,"I don't know, everything's a bit wider apart."
00:30:10.440,00:30:11.760,I'm fine.
00:30:11.880,00:30:13.760,Really?
00:30:13.880,00:30:15.200,"Yeah, I'm fine."
00:30:15.320,00:30:17.880,"Right, you're on."
00:30:34.360,00:30:37.240,"A little closer, please."
00:30:40.960,00:30:43.280,A little closer.
00:30:46.120,00:30:47.440,"Into the light, love."
00:30:55.520,00:30:57.800,And who are we looking at here?
00:30:57.920,00:30:59.320,Abi Khan.
00:30:59.440,00:31:02.480,"What are you gonna do for us today, Abi?"
00:31:02.600,00:31:03.840,I'm gonna sing.
00:31:03.960,00:31:05.360,"Can you speak up, love?"
00:31:05.480,00:31:06.600,We don't bite.
00:31:08.360,00:31:09.880,I'm going to sing.
00:31:10.000,00:31:14.640,"Hey, would you mind lifting up your top for me?"
00:31:14.760,00:31:17.000,"Hey, can you take off your top?"
00:31:17.120,00:31:18.480,I wanna check out those titties.
00:31:18.600,00:31:20.400,Woo-ho-ho-ho!
00:31:22.560,00:31:24.840,"Come on, mucho ferranto."
00:31:25.600,00:31:27.440,"Ah, no titties!"
00:31:28.600,00:31:30.440,She says she's here to sing.
00:31:30.560,00:31:33.240,"I gotta see those titties, though."
00:31:33.360,00:31:34.880,"Come on, girl."
00:31:35.000,00:31:39.360,"I mean, damn, ha, ha, ha, ha, you hot."
00:31:39.480,00:31:42.400,"Please, just sing for us."
00:34:05.160,00:34:08.440,"Okay, I'm gonna stop you there."
00:34:08.560,00:34:12.200,That was...
00:34:14.600,00:34:16.600,probably...
00:34:16.720,00:34:18.920,the best piece of singing we've had this season.
00:34:19.040,00:34:21.160,Yes! Well done!
00:34:26.600,00:34:28.400,Fair play.
00:34:30.960,00:34:32.480,But I have to say...
00:34:33.640,00:34:34.680,No...
00:34:34.800,00:34:39.880,"No. No, no, no, I have to say, actually I'm with Wraith on this one."
00:34:40.000,00:34:44.360,Good though your voice is and it is good...
00:34:44.480,00:34:47.440,it's not the most magical sound in the world.
00:34:47.560,00:34:50.280,It's just good.
00:34:50.400,00:34:53.240,I don't think anyone's really hearing it.
00:34:53.360,00:34:55.920,Certainly not the guys in the audience.
00:34:56.040,00:34:59.280,These looks you got going on kinda get in the way.
00:34:59.400,00:35:02.600,"Men will want you, women will hate you."
00:35:02.720,00:35:04.280,All the time you were on stage...
00:35:04.400,00:35:07.600,I couldn't help picturing you...
00:35:07.720,00:35:09.800,in an erotic scenario.
00:35:09.920,00:35:13.680,"Getting pretty turned on, if I'm honest."
00:35:16.800,00:35:18.200,Right.
00:35:18.320,00:35:30.880,"You've got this pure beauty, seems to be a knockout figure, and this sort of interesting innocence going on, and that's something I think Wraith's erotica channels could really play with."
00:35:32.760,00:35:36.560,That's what I thought the moment I saw you. The moment.
00:35:36.680,00:35:38.160,I'd watch.
00:35:38.280,00:35:40.160,I don't know a man here who wouldn't.
00:35:40.280,00:35:41.760,"To be honest, some of us girls might join you."
00:35:42.920,00:35:45.240,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
00:35:46.920,00:35:48.360,Get off me!
00:35:48.480,00:35:49.640,No! Abi! No!
00:35:49.760,00:35:50.760,"I don't, I don't..."
00:35:50.880,00:35:52.680,"Get gone! No, Abi! Abi!"
00:35:52.800,00:35:54.880,I don't think that's quite what I was...
00:35:56.800,00:36:02.320,"You will never have to pedal again, not one minute!"
00:36:02.440,00:36:04.680,We could really work with you.
00:36:04.800,00:36:08.600,"Last year we had singers, singers, singers."
00:36:08.720,00:36:10.160,So many singers.
00:36:10.280,00:36:12.480,So to be a singer you've gotta be truly exceptional.
00:36:12.600,00:36:14.080,Yeah.
00:36:14.200,00:36:18.880,"just no slots left for an above-average singer, not for the next few years at least."
00:36:19.000,00:36:20.000,Charity?
00:36:20.120,00:36:23.040,No. Saturation point singer wise.
00:36:23.160,00:36:28.440,right from the start we're gonna go with something different this season.
00:36:28.560,00:36:30.840,That's why he's on the panel!
00:36:30.960,00:36:35.000,She would be a star on our stream.
00:36:35.120,00:36:36.400,A star!
00:36:36.520,00:36:41.680,"On his, you're furniture at best."
00:36:41.800,00:36:43.240,Forget about all the shame and all that...
00:36:43.360,00:36:46.760,put-put-put-put-put-put.
00:36:46.880,00:36:49.160,You will have pleasure forever!
00:36:49.280,00:36:53.560,"Realistically, sweetheart, it is that or the bike."
00:36:56.320,00:36:57.800,"I don't, I don't think..."
00:36:57.920,00:37:00.160,"Okay, you know what, this is starting to annoy me."
00:37:00.280,00:37:04.320,Who do you think is powering that spotlight?
00:37:09.080,00:37:17.920,"Millions of people, that's who, all of 'em out there right now, putting in an honest day at the bike."
00:37:18.040,00:37:21.320,"While you stand in the light, they're generating and dither."
00:37:21.440,00:37:22.560,You know what?
00:37:22.680,00:37:28.160,"They would give anything, do anything to be where you are now. Am I right?"
00:37:32.760,00:37:39.760,at all that as though it's nothing... as though they're nothing...
00:37:39.880,00:37:41.880,and that makes me sick.
00:37:43.040,00:37:45.040,But do you know what?
00:37:45.160,00:37:50.720,Maybe you do belong on a bike because you don't seem very willing to step off it.
00:37:53.000,00:37:54.120,I do want to.
00:37:54.240,00:37:55.800,Do we have a decision?
00:37:55.920,00:37:59.800,Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
00:38:29.920,00:38:31.960,I suppose.
00:38:40.560,00:38:42.440,"Ah, hoo-hoo-hoo!"
00:38:42.560,00:38:44.120,Well done!
00:39:46.280,00:39:49.520,about my new lifestyle...
00:39:49.640,00:39:52.520,I get to meet lots of hot guys.
00:39:54.160,00:39:57.400,Wraith treats me well.
00:39:57.520,00:40:01.040,"Oh, for Christ's sake!"
00:40:01.160,00:40:02.960,I pay for this!
00:40:03.080,00:40:06.160,I pay for this!
00:40:06.280,00:40:10.040,"I pump my arse off and you, fuck you!"
00:40:12.240,00:40:14.280,"Yeah, keep waddling, pig tits!"
00:40:14.400,00:40:18.200,Find the horizon and fuck off over it!
00:40:22.400,00:40:26.120,I get to live in a...
00:40:26.240,00:40:30.880,beautiful place and...
00:40:31.000,00:40:35.400,wear lots of beautiful things.
00:40:40.080,00:40:42.240,It's a dream.
00:41:05.040,00:41:06.080,Insufficient funds.
00:41:06.200,00:41:08.840,New from Wraith Babes...
00:41:11.480,00:41:13.760,...a Wraith Babes reality special.
00:41:13.880,00:41:17.000,I guess I'd like to be as big as Selma one day.
00:41:17.120,00:41:23.080,her glide through the Hot Shot curtain of dreams to sing her heart out.
00:41:26.800,00:41:30.360,What happened next shocked them all.
00:41:30.480,00:41:31.680,We could really work with you.
00:41:31.800,00:41:33.840,Do we have a decision?
00:41:33.960,00:41:38.160,stunning erotic debut.
00:41:41.280,00:41:42.720,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:41:42.840,00:41:46.760,Who do we have here?
00:41:46.880,00:41:48.600,I'm Abi.
00:41:48.720,00:41:52.520,You entered Hot Shot.
00:41:56.200,00:41:58.720,Resume viewing. Resume viewing.
00:41:58.840,00:42:00.520,No!

00:42:21.960,00:42:23.440,Open your mouth.
00:42:23.560,00:42:24.800,Open.
00:42:24.920,00:42:28.000,"Take it in. Take it in, ah."
00:42:28.120,00:42:30.360,Yeah.
00:42:31.720,00:42:33.320,No!
00:42:33.760,00:42:35.000,No! No!
00:44:38.720,00:44:44.360,"New from Wraith Babes, the hottest girls in the nastiest situations."
00:48:21.960,00:48:24.240,"Can you stand aside, please."
00:48:26.280,00:48:27.720,"Okay, we're gonna preview you."
00:48:27.840,00:48:29.560,You wanna come up into the back.
00:48:29.680,00:48:31.320,Are you messing?
00:48:37.880,00:48:40.080,A what nic one?
00:48:40.200,00:48:42.040,"Oh, an ethnic one."
00:48:42.160,00:48:43.360,Uh...
00:48:44.400,00:48:45.920,On it.
00:48:46.040,00:48:47.920,"Mate, we're gonna preview you, all right?"
00:48:48.040,00:48:50.600,Do you wanna follow me in the back?
00:48:50.720,00:48:52.280,You're a prick!
00:48:56.120,00:48:58.360,Next lot.
00:49:02.760,00:49:05.080,"So what are you, a magician?"
00:49:06.320,00:49:07.800,An entertainer.
00:49:07.920,00:49:11.200,Could you say that down the screen as a self-contained sentence?
00:49:12.520,00:49:14.520,I'm an entertainer.
00:49:22.720,00:49:24.720,need to drink a Compliance.
00:49:24.840,00:49:26.640,"Yeah, they gave me one back there."
00:49:26.760,00:49:32.160,"Really? Oh, okay. Well, in that case you are good to ... go."
00:49:45.840,00:49:47.560,Who are you?
00:49:47.680,00:49:49.800,Bing Madsen.
00:49:49.920,00:49:51.200,planning to do for us?
00:49:51.320,00:49:52.560,What the fuck!
00:49:55.520,00:49:57.000,A sort of performance?
00:49:57.120,00:49:58.080,Yes.
00:49:58.200,00:50:01.200,Mmm! A man of mystery!
00:50:05.200,00:50:08.120,we'd better see it.
00:50:08.240,00:50:10.120,Okay.
00:50:50.960,00:50:52.360,Knob-head!
00:50:52.480,00:50:54.200,Fucking cock!
00:51:07.680,00:51:09.400,Stop there or I'll do it.
00:51:09.520,00:51:11.080,This is a main artery.
00:51:15.520,00:51:19.240,"No one stops me, not till I've said my piece then you can do what you like."
00:51:19.360,00:51:21.160,just fucking kill yourself.
00:51:21.280,00:51:26.400,"But you get any on me, dog, I swear to God I'd kick your ass back to life, just so I could cut your goddamn head off."
00:51:28.520,00:51:30.840,Go on!
00:51:33.040,00:51:34.600,I think we should let him speak.
00:51:34.720,00:51:39.080,Speak! Speak! Speak!
00:51:42.440,00:51:44.720,Let's hear what he has to say.
00:51:48.200,00:51:53.880,"Well, come on, got our attention, as requested."
00:51:55.480,00:51:57.400,What do you wanna say?
00:52:00.400,00:52:03.320,"Have you prepared a speech, is that it?"
00:52:06.080,00:52:07.400,Speak!
00:52:07.520,00:52:09.120,I haven't got a speech!
00:52:09.240,00:52:11.120,I didn't even try to.
00:52:09.240,00:52:13.920,I ... I just knew I had to get here to stand here and I knew I wanted you to listen.
00:52:14.040,00:52:17.840,"To really listen, not just pull a face like you're listening, like you do the rest of the time."
00:52:17.960,00:52:20.520,A face like you're feeling instead of processing.
00:52:20.640,00:52:27.880,"You pull a face and poke it towards this stage and we la-di-da, we sing and dance and tumble around."
00:52:28.000,00:52:33.440,"And all you see up here, it's not people, you don't see people up here, it's all fodder!"
00:52:33.560,00:52:37.160,And the faker the fodder is the more you love it because fake fodder's the only thing that works anymore!
00:52:37.280,00:52:39.920,Fake fodder is all that we can stomach.
00:52:40.040,00:52:41.360,Actually not quite all.
00:52:41.480,00:52:43.280,"Real pain, real viciousness, that we can take."
00:52:43.400,00:52:51.680,"Yeah, stick a fat man up a pole and we'll laugh ourselves feral, because we've earnt the right! We've done cell time, and he's slacking, the scum, so ha-ha-ha at him!"
00:52:51.800,00:52:58.120,"'Cause we're so out of our minds with desperation, we don't know any better! All we know is fake fodder and buying shit!"
00:52:58.240,00:53:03.840,"That's how we speak to each other, how we express ourself is buying shit!"
00:53:03.960,00:53:09.480,The peak of our dreams is a new hat for our dopple; a hat that doesn't exist; that's not even there!
00:53:09.600,00:53:15.160,"We buy shit that's not even there! Show us something real and free and beautiful you couldn't, yeah?"
00:53:15.280,00:53:17.640,It'd break us.
00:53:17.760,00:53:19.400,I might as well choke.
00:53:19.520,00:53:39.400,"There's only so much wonder we can bear, that's why when you find any wonder whatsoever you dole it out in meagre portions, and only then till it's augmented and packaged and pumped through 10,000 pre-assigned filters, till it's nothing more than a meaningless series of lights, while we ride day-in day-out, going where? Powering what?"
00:53:39.520,00:53:44.480,"All tiny cells and tiny screens, and bigger cells and bigger screens, and fuck you!"
00:53:44.600,00:53:48.000,"Fuck you, that's what it boils down to is fuck you!"
00:53:48.120,00:53:51.280,Fuck you for sitting there and slowly making things worse.
00:53:51.400,00:54:11.920,"Fuck you and your spotlight and your sanctimonious faces, and fuck you all for taking the one thing I ever came close to anything real about anything; for oozing around it and crushing it into a bone, into a joke, one more ugly joke in a kingdom of millions of them!"
00:54:12.040,00:54:15.000,"Fuck you for me, for us, for everyone!"
00:54:15.120,00:54:16.880,Fuck you!
00:54:37.840,00:54:42.240,That was without a doubt...
00:54:42.360,00:54:48.280,the most heartfelt thing I've seen on this stage since Hot Shot began!
00:54:48.400,00:54:50.840,Yeah!
00:54:54.440,00:54:55.840,Brilliant! Yeah!
00:54:58.280,00:55:05.920,"You're so articulating someone we all... and I mean everyone in this hall, something we all agree on."
00:55:06.040,00:55:13.360,"Even though we may not comprehend all of it, I think I'm right in saying we do feel it."
00:55:13.840,00:55:15.280,Even me.
00:55:15.400,00:55:17.960,I know you've got me down as this creature.
00:55:18.080,00:55:25.640,"But, you know, hey, I get where you're coming from and I like your stuff."
00:55:25.760,00:55:27.080,It's not stuff it's...
00:55:27.200,00:55:30.000,It's truth. Am I right?
00:55:30.120,00:55:35.000,"Your truth, admittedly, but truth nonetheless."
00:55:35.120,00:55:40.760,"And you're right, authenticity is in woefully short supply."
00:55:42.320,00:55:44.520,I'd like to hear you talk again.
00:55:47.440,00:55:49.600,How so?
00:55:49.720,00:55:55.920,With a slot on one of my streams where you can talk just like that.
00:55:58.520,00:56:02.600,I'd watch it.
00:56:04.560,00:56:06.240,He's alright.
00:56:06.360,00:56:11.160,"You're a little out there but, that throat-cutting thing, neat gimmick."
00:56:11.280,00:56:14.640,What do you say?
00:56:16.600,00:56:19.880,Do it! Do it!
00:56:34.440,00:56:36.440,"Go on, you bastard!"
00:56:41.560,00:56:43.440,Beats the bike.
00:56:43.560,00:56:45.440,Certainly does!
00:57:00.960,00:57:03.200,We have with us Oliver.
00:57:00.960,00:57:06.680,"Now, Oliver was once a cleaner six months ago, but he ate, and ate 'til he hit 17 stone!"
00:57:06.800,00:57:11.240,And he's here today to try and beat us on Botherguts!
00:57:13.000,00:57:15.320,"Oh, here goes a big one."
00:57:24.160,00:57:26.240,gonna stop you there.
00:57:26.360,00:57:29.760,That was achingly terrible.
00:57:29.880,00:57:31.680,You have the magnetism of a towel.
00:57:31.800,00:57:33.720,I don't ever want to look at you again.
00:57:33.840,00:57:37.040,I have to agree.
00:57:37.160,00:57:43.440,You came across as fundamentally unlikeable and really quite worthless.
00:57:44.960,00:57:48.560,You could fill that pussy with honey and I still wouldn't fuck it.
00:57:48.680,00:57:51.280,"I can sing, yeah?"
00:57:51.400,00:57:54.320,'Cause it's my destiny and I can sing!
00:57:54.440,00:58:01.120,"Fu-- don't you, Abi?"
00:58:01.240,00:58:04.040,Mmm hmm. Say it.
00:58:04.160,00:58:07.120,Yeah.
00:58:07.240,00:58:13.760,wardrobe options launched last week alone.
00:58:13.880,00:58:22.720,"Which effectively translates as 15,000 new ways to kill time in your cell before you explore an afterlife, which doesn't exist anyway."
00:58:22.840,00:58:27.600,"But with any luck it'll take your mind off those saddle sores, eh?"
00:58:27.720,00:58:33.240,"You know, the only thing stopping me from slashing myself open right now?"
00:58:33.360,00:58:35.280,I might not die right away.
00:58:35.400,00:58:43.000,"And, before I went, they'd find a way to charge my twitching half-dead cadaver 20,000 merits for swabbing the walls clean."
00:58:43.120,00:58:44.520,Yeah.
00:58:44.640,00:58:48.960,"Anyway, hang on in there, if you must."
00:58:54.240,00:58:56.880,We're all in this together they say.
00:58:57.000,00:59:00.200,"Yeah, right!"
00:59:00.320,00:59:04.680,Farewell forever!
00:59:04.800,00:59:06.920,Till the same time next week.
00:59:10.280,00:59:12.640,Stream offline.
00:00:23.560,00:00:24.640,Thank you.
00:00:24.760,00:00:26.480,"Okay, little speech time."
00:00:26.600,00:00:35.600,"I've been mentioning this to everyone about their appraisals, and I just want you to know that this isn't a witch hunt for the deadwood okay."
00:00:35.720,00:00:38.720,treasure hunt for the gold.
00:00:38.840,00:00:41.760,"Shit sinks, but also cream floats."
00:00:41.880,00:00:43.840,"Yes, yes I see that."

00:01:00.520,00:01:02.960,"Right, and we're okay the firm's okay ..."
00:01:03.080,00:01:05.920,with that ethically and morally?
00:01:09.520,00:01:10.400,Yep.
00:01:10.520,00:01:11.280,Huh-huh.
00:01:11.400,00:01:12.480,Sure.
00:01:12.600,00:01:14.760,"Yeah, yeah right."
00:01:14.880,00:01:16.480,Are you?
00:01:16.600,00:01:18.600,"Totally, yeah."
00:01:19.120,00:01:21.320,Yes.
00:01:22.160,00:01:24.080,"Okay, Liam, look..."
00:01:24.200,00:01:32.760,"So if we invite you to stay with the firm in the new environment, what we'd have you to is pull an exhaustive re-do with personnel maybe next week?"
00:01:32.880,00:01:36.240,"Oh, well, I, I was ready to do a big re-do right now, but..."
00:01:36.360,00:01:38.320,"No, no, no, it's fine, next week's fine."
00:01:38.440,00:01:44.160,"But I have to ask you this, they aren't gonna hit anything to freak us out are they?"
00:01:44.280,00:01:46.880,"They're not, there's no major deletions this quarter?"
00:01:47.000,00:01:50.640,"No, no, everything's well within parameters."
00:01:50.760,00:01:54.120,"Great, okay, Liam this has been really great."
00:01:56.400,00:02:01.080,Look really hope to look forward to seeing you again.

00:04:03.440,00:04:06.920,"Great, and back that up for me times 64 for the week."
00:04:13.400,00:04:16.240,That's great.
00:04:19.960,00:04:23.200,"I'm not being funny, right, but look at that."
00:04:23.320,00:04:24.360,Look at what?
00:04:24.480,00:04:27.280,That frayed carpet.
00:04:27.400,00:04:28.720,"There, you see?"
00:04:28.840,00:04:30.200,Seriously?
00:04:30.320,00:04:34.320,"Yes, seriously."
00:04:34.440,00:04:37.040,I've paid good money to have perfect details.
00:04:37.160,00:04:40.280,"Now, I've got that shitty carpet for the rest of my life."
00:04:40.400,00:04:42.680,"Only if you keep looking at it, mate."
00:04:42.800,00:04:47.040,"Oh, thanks, Jonas!"
00:04:47.160,00:04:52.520,"Alright now, now you thought the carpet was bad, have a look at this."
00:04:55.960,00:04:59.480,But you've met Lucy my wife at the Dublin wedding?
00:04:59.600,00:05:01.680,"Oh, that's right, yeah, hi, Liam."

00:05:29.880,00:05:31.760,"We didn't know, she didn't know if you were gonna make it."
00:05:31.880,00:05:34.320,"Well, it was over quicker than I thought, so..."
00:05:34.960,00:05:35.760,Whoop.

00:05:47.760,00:05:49.240,"Okay, thank you."
00:06:00.160,00:06:02.960,Hi.
00:06:03.080,00:06:05.720,"You're back early then I, I didn't think you'd make it."
00:06:05.840,00:06:09.760,"Yeah, well, I didn't stay over and I caught an early flight back, so..."
00:06:09.880,00:06:11.520,- Hiya.
00:06:12.520,00:06:14.240,So how was the appraisal?
00:06:14.360,00:06:17.880,"Well, they said they'd let me do a re-do sometime next week, so..."
00:06:18.000,00:06:19.000,"Oh, but good?"
00:06:19.120,00:06:21.080,Well...

00:06:34.520,00:06:35.920,"- Good, good thank you."
00:06:36.040,00:06:37.160,And you know Jeff?
00:06:37.280,00:06:38.800,Yes.
00:06:38.920,00:06:44.280,"Yeah, you'd remember meeting Jeff, 'cause he would have shown you, I don't know, a re-do of the side of this fridge, something like that."
00:06:44.400,00:06:45.320,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:45.440,00:06:46.760,Hello.

00:06:50.240,00:06:51.680,"Yeah, tell me about it."
00:06:51.800,00:06:53.080,"Oh, you alright for a drink?"
00:06:53.200,00:06:54.440,"I'm fine, thank you, Jonas."

00:06:56.080,00:07:00.680,"Colleen, come and meet Liam, he's..."
00:07:00.800,00:07:03.600,Soon to be unemployed slash unemployable lawyer.
00:07:03.720,00:07:06.360,Hi.
00:07:06.480,00:07:13.440,And Jeff. Jeff and Fi used to run the parties down the Fraser Road with Paul and me.
00:07:13.560,00:07:16.280,Mad old days!
00:07:16.400,00:07:18.280,Before we started up the Kings.
00:07:18.760,00:07:19.800,So...
00:07:19.920,00:07:22.480,Yeah.
00:07:22.600,00:07:24.880,"So, Liam, what, what, what was it you had?"
00:07:25.000,00:07:26.520,Assessment?
00:07:26.640,00:07:27.840,Appraisal.
00:07:27.960,00:07:29.240,How'd it go?
00:07:29.360,00:07:31.160,Good.
00:07:31.280,00:07:35.200,"Well, it was, it was a disaster but, you know, I, I don't know."
00:07:35.320,00:07:37.000,- Hard to gauge?
00:07:37.120,00:07:39.440,"Well let's have a look, re-do, we can appraise the appraisal."
00:07:41.240,00:07:42.600,"Yeah, right."
00:07:42.720,00:07:43.960,Throw it up there and we can grade you.
00:07:44.080,00:07:46.880,- Er...
00:07:47.000,00:07:49.600,"Well, it could be fun, we could... vote!"
00:07:50.280,00:07:52.680,- Paul?
00:07:52.800,00:07:55.520,"recruitment actually so it might be quite useful for you, going forward."
00:07:55.640,00:07:57.320,"Right, okay."
00:07:57.440,00:07:58.480,Liam's gonna re-do his appraisal so we can give him marks.
00:07:59.640,00:08:00.800,"Well, no pointers, you know."
00:08:00.920,00:08:01.880,I think Liam would probably...
00:08:02.000,00:08:03.440,"Yeah, do you know what, guys..."
00:08:03.560,00:08:06.040,"Hey, guys. Now come on seriously, that's not cool."
00:08:06.160,00:08:08.960,I mean Liam's obviously uncomfortable so let's just...
00:08:09.080,00:08:11.160,"...drop it, yeah?"
00:08:11.280,00:08:13.200,Have a cool time.
00:08:21.520,00:08:24.560,"Thank you so much for inviting us this evening, it's been too long."
00:08:24.680,00:08:25.760,"Yes, it has."
00:08:25.880,00:08:27.080,Too long.
00:08:27.200,00:08:28.960,Fi?
00:08:30.960,00:08:33.080,I haven't met him before have I?
00:08:33.200,00:08:35.280,He's one of the old crowd.
00:08:35.400,00:08:36.920,I think I said.
00:08:37.040,00:08:38.160,Oh.
00:08:38.280,00:08:39.880,- You okay?
00:08:40.000,00:08:41.240,You know if you're not in the mood we can go.
00:08:41.360,00:08:42.480,"No, no, I'm fine."
00:08:42.600,00:08:44.240,Sure?
00:09:03.320,00:09:04.760,Hey.
00:09:07.080,00:09:09.680,enough for others to share.
00:09:09.800,00:09:11.160,Thank you.
00:09:11.280,00:09:12.840,I've been cooking a lot since the break-up.
00:09:18.920,00:09:20.360,"Yeah, yeah."
00:09:20.480,00:09:28.880,"We were in the middle of planning it all and I suddenly realised that the less the relationship means the more you spend on the wedding, you know."
00:09:29.000,00:09:38.880,"You actually start obsessing over, over the tiniest little details, like, like the thickness of the wedding invitation paper, 'cause I mean God knows you need something to fucking talk about!"
00:09:39.000,00:09:44.840,"So everybody, this is Hallam, Hallam, Jonas."
00:09:44.960,00:09:46.320,- Hi.
00:09:46.440,00:09:49.000,And everyone!
00:09:49.120,00:09:50.400,- Hi.
00:09:52.240,00:09:53.560,Jonas was just explaining why relationships are a sham.
00:09:53.680,00:09:55.760,Are they? Shit!
00:09:55.880,00:09:58.840,They're like going to the theatre.
00:09:58.960,00:10:06.880,"You pay loads to go and ultimately you're wasting your entire night, so when someone asks you Did you have a good time?"
00:10:07.000,00:10:25.640,"you both say Yeah you know, Yeah, it was great, but the problem is the more that you pay, and the longer it goes on, the more you're Oh, yeah we really loved it, you know, We, we love being together and never fucking anyone else and only having just one other person to share our real thoughts with for our entire lives."
00:10:25.760,00:10:27.360,"I mean, yeah, it's great."
00:10:27.480,00:10:29.560,Would you say you loved her though?
00:10:32.160,00:10:38.080,"I just think we just really fancied each other, and that was what it was."
00:10:38.200,00:10:45.000,"You know what it's like early on, you know, we were just, I don't know, we're just two tools in a tool shed that just fit together really fucking well."
00:10:45.120,00:10:56.680,"I mean still by the end I'd be like Go on, honey, you go up, I'm just gonna watch a little bit more of the news, and I'd find myself, you know, watching re-does of like hot times in earlier relationships."
00:10:58.560,00:11:02.760,"I'm just saying, there's a beautiful woman upstairs, you know, waiting to have sex with me..."
00:11:02.880,00:11:03.600,"What, right now?"
00:11:07.400,00:11:22.280,"She's upstairs you know waiting to have sex with me, and I'm sat downstairs watching re-does of like some hot times with some hot girl that I'd just picked up in some place, and I'm fucking pulling myself off. I mean, seriously."
00:11:25.280,00:11:29.200,"Ah, come on."
00:11:25.280,00:11:34.880,"Come on, guys, I mean, we all scroll through the grain rifling through our greatest hits for a little bit of filth now and then, surely?"
00:11:35.560,00:11:37.160,Not me.
00:11:39.120,00:11:41.360,Hallam doesn't have a grain.
00:11:44.080,00:11:45.720,No shit.
00:11:45.840,00:11:47.200,Is that a political thing?
00:11:47.320,00:11:50.200,"No, no, I was gouged about 12 months ago."
00:11:50.320,00:11:53.040,"Jesus, was that painful?"
00:11:53.160,00:11:55.480,Total agony.
00:11:55.600,00:11:57.560,"But on the plus of that, I don't remember it that clearly."
00:11:57.680,00:12:00.160,There's a scar in here.
00:12:00.280,00:12:01.160,Yeah?
00:12:01.280,00:12:02.640,Can I...?
00:12:13.680,00:12:15.560,"Yeah, it feels quite nice."
00:12:17.120,00:12:19.720,And no brain damage clearly.
00:12:19.840,00:12:22.800,"Well, my sight held on fine."
00:12:24.760,00:12:30.520,as far as they could tell probably to some millionaire Chinese perv.
00:12:30.640,00:12:32.280,- Yeah.
00:12:32.400,00:12:33.600,Is that for real?
00:12:33.720,00:12:35.360,"Yeah, and none of it was encrypted, so..."
00:12:35.480,00:12:38.520,So they saw the lot?
00:12:38.640,00:12:43.440,But the thing is after I was gouged I didn't have one for a few days and then just kind of liked it.
00:12:46.400,00:12:52.880,"I mean because more people, I mean it's a big thing now right?"
00:12:53.000,00:12:54.360,"Like, going grainless?"
00:12:54.480,00:12:55.680,it's huge with hookers.
00:12:55.800,00:12:57.760,"I mean, no offence!"
00:12:58.800,00:13:01.000,"No, no, it's okay."
00:13:01.120,00:13:03.320,"Well, I'm pretty boring."
00:13:03.440,00:13:04.840,Boo!
00:13:06.320,00:13:08.600,Serial monogamist.
00:13:08.720,00:13:10.040,I'm a serial monogamist.
00:13:10.160,00:13:12.800,I'm staying faithful to my cornflakes right now.
00:13:16.640,00:13:19.840,"Well I think it's an interesting choice, going grainless."
00:13:19.960,00:13:21.480,It's a brave choice.
00:13:21.600,00:13:23.760,"I'm sorry, but..."
00:13:25.880,00:13:27.080,I couldn't do it.
00:13:27.200,00:13:28.760,Uh-huh.
00:13:31.040,00:13:35.200,"Okay, I was gonna play some re-does from the Fraser Road days."
00:13:35.320,00:13:36.760,Yey!
00:13:36.880,00:13:38.920,"Stuff from the last night, depressing or fun."
00:13:39.040,00:13:43.080,You know half the organic memories you have are junk.
00:13:43.200,00:13:44.400,Just not trustworthy.
00:13:44.520,00:13:46.200,Colleen works in grain development.
00:13:46.320,00:13:51.520,"With half the population, you can implant false memories just by asking leading questions in therapy."
00:13:51.640,00:13:59.520,"You can make people remember getting lost in shopping malls they never visited, getting bothered by paedophile baby sitters they never had."
00:14:00.800,00:14:03.440,I'm just happier now.
00:14:06.560,00:14:09.720,"Okay, great, Liam, this has been, this has been really great."
00:14:09.840,00:14:12.440,We really hope to look forward to seeing you again.
00:14:12.560,00:14:14.720,"He looks forward to seeing you again, that's good."
00:14:14.840,00:14:17.040,Hopes to look forward.
00:14:17.160,00:14:20.640,We really hope to look forward to seeing you again.
00:14:20.760,00:14:22.160,It's phoney.
00:14:23.800,00:14:25.320,"Hang on, pause it."
00:14:26.360,00:14:28.360,Now back up.
00:14:28.480,00:14:30.600,Zoom in there.
00:14:30.720,00:14:31.800,"Come on, that's a tick."
00:14:31.920,00:14:33.480,be a V or an L.
00:14:33.600,00:14:34.640,It's a tick.
00:14:34.760,00:14:36.480,Or the start of a swastika.
00:14:36.600,00:14:39.040,"It's probably the start of a swastika, they were such pricks."
00:14:44.000,00:14:45.960,Did you have fun with the old gang?
00:14:46.080,00:14:47.680,Yeah.
00:14:49.200,00:14:51.680,Speak to that Jonas much?
00:14:51.800,00:14:54.040,"No, no, not really."
00:14:56.720,00:15:00.080,He's a bit of knob innit?
00:15:00.200,00:15:01.800,Jonas.
00:15:01.920,00:15:04.640,Pulling himself off to his own relationships theories.
00:15:04.760,00:15:08.880,"Oh, it must be such a drag, Jonas, putting it about."
00:15:09.000,00:15:11.200,And when he protected me from those assholes.
00:15:11.320,00:15:15.760,"Hey, come on, guys, it's really not cool to re-do another man's appraisals dudes."
00:15:15.880,00:15:17.600,Then why invite him over?
00:15:17.720,00:15:19.360,I like him.
00:15:25.000,00:15:27.200,You wanted me to invite him.
00:15:27.320,00:15:28.600,I didn't say anything.
00:15:28.720,00:15:31.320,You were laughing at everything he said!
00:15:31.440,00:15:33.240,You invited him!
00:15:33.360,00:15:35.840,It's obvious I didn't want him to come.
00:15:39.600,00:15:41.560,early to call it a night.
00:15:41.680,00:15:43.560,a quick one down the pub?
00:15:45.160,00:15:46.640,rescue Jody from the paedophile baby sitter!
00:15:46.760,00:15:48.000,Yeah.
00:15:51.840,00:15:55.680,"But Jonas, why don't you come back to ours for a nightcap if you want?"
00:15:55.800,00:15:57.480,See.
00:15:57.600,00:16:00.160,"It was obvious I didn't want him to come, I was being polite."
00:16:00.280,00:16:02.120,To a moron.
00:16:02.240,00:16:04.760,"If you really don't want him to come, you can get rid of him."
00:16:16.280,00:16:17.240,"Hey, hey."
00:16:20.240,00:16:21.840,Well actually what time is it?
00:16:21.960,00:16:23.400,It's midnight.
00:16:23.520,00:16:26.400,"Phew, shit, it's quite late!"
00:16:26.520,00:16:28.480,"- Yeah, time does that."
00:16:28.600,00:16:29.360,"What, 15 minutes?"
00:16:29.480,00:16:30.920,Yeah.
00:16:31.040,00:16:33.400,"But it, we've got the baby sitter inside, so..."
00:16:33.520,00:16:34.960,So is that new info?
00:16:35.080,00:16:39.240,"No, it's just that, we, I mean we thought, right, Fi?"
00:16:39.360,00:16:41.160,- Yeah.
00:16:41.280,00:16:42.920,"Okay, now I get it."
00:16:43.040,00:16:48.520,"No, it's just that actually it turns out we're tired and I guess we forgot, but now we've remembered, so, sorry."
00:16:48.640,00:16:49.680,"No, it's fine really."
00:16:51.520,00:16:54.560,"Oh, it's cool, no worries, yeah I've got a backup plan so..."
00:16:54.680,00:16:56.760,"Oh, cool, well, envoke the back up."
00:16:56.880,00:16:59.720,"Yeah, I will."
00:16:59.840,00:17:00.880,"It's good to meet you, man."
00:17:01.000,00:17:02.240,Yeah.
00:17:02.760,00:17:03.640,Nice one.
00:17:03.760,00:17:05.440,"Brilliant, brilliant."
00:17:07.760,00:17:09.160,"Okay, cool."
00:17:12.600,00:17:14.720,"Good to meet you, man, yeah."
00:17:16.880,00:17:23.080,"Listen, Gina, it's a 40 minute wait for a cab, but if you want I'll have the bed made up in my office, yeah?"
00:17:23.200,00:17:25.120,"Okay, thanks, Fi."
00:17:26.840,00:17:30.720,"Hey just, you know, use anything, there's T-shirts and..."
00:17:30.840,00:17:32.280,"Alright, yes, thanks, I'll show myself up."
00:17:32.400,00:17:33.960,"- Alright, night."
00:17:34.080,00:17:35.680,"Night, Gina."
00:17:43.960,00:17:45.280,Thank you.
00:18:09.960,00:18:12.920,Is he a big part of the gang?
00:18:13.040,00:18:14.720,- Who?
00:18:15.600,00:18:18.240,"I don't know, yeah?"
00:18:18.360,00:18:22.840,"Let me guess, he's spent his time oozing around the girls, offering back rubs."
00:18:22.960,00:18:24.200,Not really.
00:18:24.320,00:18:26.360,Circling for an orifice.
00:18:28.400,00:18:29.720,Was he always that oily or...
00:18:29.840,00:18:31.920,"Okay, look..."
00:18:33.200,00:18:34.240,What?
00:18:34.360,00:18:36.200,"It's nothing, but..."
00:18:38.400,00:18:41.960,...you may have noticed a bit of an atmosphere because...
00:18:43.480,00:18:47.800,...me and Jonas years ago had a bit of a thing.
00:18:47.920,00:18:49.800,You had a thing with oily dude man.
00:18:49.920,00:18:52.520,"It was just a little thing and I didn't even know you back then, so..."
00:18:52.640,00:18:55.360,You slept with oily dude man?
00:18:55.480,00:18:57.080,That's hilarious!
00:18:57.200,00:18:58.840,"We've all got our skeletons, how about you and Gemma?"
00:18:58.960,00:19:00.400,"Well, I told you about Gemma."
00:19:00.520,00:19:05.040,"Gemma was a nutcase, but you never mentioned Jonas."
00:19:05.160,00:19:07.600,"I did, I told you I hooked up with someone in Marrakech."
00:19:09.440,00:19:11.240,"It was like a month, it was a stupid thing and then..."
00:19:11.360,00:19:15.120,"I thought Mr. Marrakech was some sort of super cool, well not him."
00:19:15.240,00:19:17.360,It was years ago and...
00:19:17.480,00:19:19.000,Are you embarrassed by that?
00:19:19.120,00:19:21.240,'Cause it's embarrassing.
00:19:23.000,00:19:25.720,"I'm sorry but, Christ, are you not embarrassed?"
00:19:25.840,00:19:27.320,It was years ago.
00:19:27.440,00:19:28.520,But you dated him for a month?
00:19:28.640,00:19:30.400,That's what I said.
00:19:30.520,00:19:35.200,"'Cause when you told me about Mr. Marrakech, it was a week."
00:19:35.320,00:19:36.720,"No, I didn't."
00:19:43.680,00:19:44.960,I don't wanna see our first time right now.
00:19:45.080,00:19:46.800,"Ssh, ssh, you're about to talk."
00:19:46.920,00:19:56.080,"little thing that did my head in for a while with this sort of, this sort of head-fuck guy in Marrakech."
00:19:57.440,00:19:59.240,Yeah!
00:19:59.360,00:20:02.680,"it, a chiller, with a big knob."
00:20:03.840,00:20:05.640,it's like a dormouse.
00:20:05.760,00:20:08.080,"Big deal, big heartbreaker?"
00:20:08.200,00:20:11.560,"No, it was just a week."
00:20:11.680,00:20:13.240,It was a weird week.
00:20:14.240,00:20:15.440,So a weird week or a month?
00:20:15.560,00:20:17.200,"The point it, it wasn't a big deal."
00:20:17.320,00:20:19.000,"Well, it was big enough to do your head in."
00:20:19.120,00:20:23.320,"Jonas, King Dormouse Dick of Marrakech did you head in."
00:20:25.800,00:20:28.120,That was a nice night.
00:20:28.240,00:20:29.960,You're getting obsessed.
00:20:30.680,00:20:31.800,I'm not.
00:20:34.840,00:20:36.880,"He had little, creepy, beady eyes and he was always..."
00:20:37.000,00:20:39.120,"What, acting like he was interested? And you know what?"
00:20:39.240,00:20:47.640,"I think, I think he probably did fancy me, and actually he wasn't completely hideous, so in another life I don't know, but nothing happened!"
00:20:48.480,00:20:50.960,And Jonas...
00:20:51.080,00:20:55.280,"Oh, he's an old fling! So what?"
00:20:55.400,00:20:56.560,"Oh, what, I'm fucked up, am I?"
00:20:56.680,00:20:58.400,"No, I mean just..."
00:20:58.520,00:21:01.720,"No, no, that's brilliant, 'cause sometimes you're a bitch."
00:21:04.880,00:21:07.640,I didn't mean that.
00:21:08.720,00:21:09.680,You're a bitch.
00:21:09.800,00:21:11.480,I'd like you to erase that.
00:21:11.600,00:21:12.600,You're a bitch.
00:21:12.720,00:21:14.200,Also sometimes.
00:21:14.320,00:21:17.680,You can't just edit off the word sometimes.
00:21:58.680,00:22:00.520,"I'm sorry, Fi."
00:22:00.640,00:22:03.680,I know I go a bit weird and wonky sometimes.
00:22:13.000,00:22:14.600,"I love you, you know."
00:22:14.720,00:22:16.120,I know.
00:23:32.280,00:23:36.240,... in a tool shed that just fit together really fucking well.
00:23:36.360,00:23:47.240,"But still by the end I'd be like Go on, you go up to bed, I'm just gonna catch a little bit more of the news, and then I'd find myself, you know, watching re-does and like hot times in earlier relationships!"
00:23:47.360,00:23:58.080,I've got a beautiful woman upstairs waiting to have sex with me and I find myself watching re-does of my hot times in earlier relationships.
00:23:58.200,00:24:00.320,Easy!
00:24:04.400,00:24:07.680,reconstruction enabled.
00:24:07.800,00:24:09.920,"Hey, it's good to see you."
00:24:10.040,00:24:11.720,Good to see you too.
00:24:11.840,00:24:13.560,I was nervous when I heard you were going to be here.
00:24:13.680,00:24:15.520,It's weird isn't it?
00:24:17.760,00:24:18.920,Morning.
00:24:19.040,00:24:21.720,"Gina, over here."
00:24:21.840,00:24:23.960,"Come here a second, I just want your opinion."
00:24:24.080,00:24:26.440,It's just a silly game.
00:24:30.160,00:24:32.960,Sit down.
00:24:34.960,00:24:37.400,"No, I'm a serial monogamist."
00:24:37.520,00:24:40.360,I'm staying faithful to my cornflakes right now.
00:24:43.520,00:24:46.440,"Now, is that funny?"
00:24:46.560,00:24:48.040,Er...
00:24:48.160,00:24:51.440,"There's no need to be nice, the man's a prick."
00:24:51.560,00:24:55.360,Is that funny in your opinion?
00:24:55.480,00:24:56.520,Well...
00:24:56.640,00:24:58.960,"No, I'm a serial monogamist."
00:24:59.080,00:25:02.440,I'm staying faithful to my cornflakes right now.
00:25:03.720,00:25:04.520,"Erm, no."
00:25:04.640,00:25:05.680,No.
00:25:05.800,00:25:07.760,- I dunno.
00:25:07.880,00:25:09.160,- Hey.
00:25:09.720,00:25:11.240,What's this?
00:25:11.360,00:25:12.520,"Oh, I'm just getting Gina's opinion on something."
00:25:12.640,00:25:15.120,"No, I'm a serial monogamist."
00:25:15.240,00:25:18.080,I'm staying faithful to my cornflakes right now.
00:25:20.160,00:25:24.200,"I was just wondering because you found it funny but it clearly isn't, and Gina agrees."
00:25:24.320,00:25:25.520,I didn't really wanna get involved.
00:25:25.640,00:25:26.720,"Gina, let me get you a cab."
00:25:28.600,00:25:35.280,"Just one, just one, one other thing. We both wanted him to come back, but who wants him to come back more?"
00:25:35.400,00:25:38.640,"In your opinion, off the top of your head, who wants him to come back more?"
00:25:42.040,00:25:44.240,"Wow, it's early. It's early to call it a night."
00:25:44.360,00:25:46.520,a quick one down the pub?
00:25:46.640,00:25:50.480,"gotta get back, rescue Jody from the paedophile baby sitter!"
00:25:50.600,00:25:52.600,"Oh, that's just a, that's a joke."
00:25:53.480,00:25:54.760,Sorry.
00:25:54.880,00:25:58.680,"Jonas, why don't you come back to ours for a nightcap if you want?"
00:25:59.320,00:26:01.160,Yeah. Yeah.
00:26:02.360,00:26:03.640,"No, ignore the joke."
00:26:03.760,00:26:05.760,Who's more keen for him to come back?
00:26:05.880,00:26:06.760,I don't know.
00:26:06.880,00:26:07.760,I'll see you out.
00:26:09.400,00:26:10.240,he's really hung over.
00:26:26.160,00:26:28.440,I'm staying faithful to my cornflakes right now.
00:26:30.120,00:26:31.720,That is just objectively not funny.
00:26:31.840,00:26:34.080,Anyone would say that's not funny.
00:26:34.200,00:26:36.400,That was fucking embarrassing.
00:26:38.880,00:26:41.360,"Whatever you're cueing up, stop it."
00:26:41.480,00:26:43.160,"Sit down, please."
00:26:52.680,00:26:54.360,Do you see that?
00:26:55.040,00:26:56.320,You know Jeff?
00:26:58.280,00:27:04.400,"meeting Jeff 'cause he would have shown you, I don't know, a re-do of the side of his fridge, something like that."
00:27:04.520,00:27:05.400,Spot the difference.
00:27:05.520,00:27:06.280,You're drunk.
00:27:06.400,00:27:08.120,I'm the difference.
00:27:08.240,00:27:10.360,"He's the greatest guy in the world, and then I arrive and..."
00:27:10.480,00:27:12.200,you clam.
00:27:12.320,00:27:13.800,For clarity.
00:27:16.000,00:27:17.160,We're just talking!
00:27:17.280,00:27:20.880,But moments later you're so stiff.
00:27:21.000,00:27:23.280,"I don't know, a re-do of the side of his fridge..."
00:27:23.400,00:27:25.320,how to stand around him.
00:27:25.440,00:27:27.320,"Your gauges are all over the place, hot and cold."
00:27:27.440,00:27:28.720,This is just stupid!
00:27:28.840,00:27:31.760,"But you can't hide it, not completely."
00:27:31.880,00:27:34.680,See how you look at him.
00:27:34.800,00:27:38.320,"The less the relationship means, the more you spend on the wedding."
00:27:38.440,00:27:44.440,"I mean really, you start obsessing over these tiny little details, and the thickness of the wedding invitation paper."
00:27:44.560,00:27:46.240,"Now, how you look at me."
00:27:46.360,00:27:52.720,Well I think it's an interesting choice going grainless I'm sorry but...
00:27:54.280,00:27:58.080,Tell me you look at me nice like you look at him.
00:27:58.200,00:27:59.520,You can't.
00:27:59.640,00:28:01.120,"And how am I looking at you now, Liam?"
00:28:01.240,00:28:02.280,How long did you go out with him for?
00:28:02.400,00:28:03.600,Does it matter?
00:28:08.400,00:28:12.280,You know half the organic memories you have are junk.
00:28:12.400,00:28:13.840,Just not trustworthy.
00:28:13.960,00:28:15.240,"Well, when it comes to little things."
00:28:15.360,00:28:16.840,And big ones.
00:28:20.520,00:28:22.840,Does that look like Marrakech?
00:28:26.360,00:28:27.640,No.
00:28:27.760,00:28:29.680,It's not Marrakech.
00:28:29.800,00:28:32.520,So how long did you go out with him for?
00:28:35.760,00:28:38.400,"Alright, about six months."
00:28:41.440,00:28:44.800,"So not a, not a week or a month, six months?"
00:28:44.920,00:28:46.960,The ever-inflating romance.
00:28:47.080,00:28:48.520,You're probably still going out with him.
00:28:48.640,00:28:51.400,Why am I on trial here?
00:28:51.520,00:28:52.560,What's been going on?
00:28:52.680,00:28:55.320,Nothing has been going on!
00:28:55.440,00:28:56.920,It was...
00:28:57.040,00:29:02.720,Christ you know how it is when you first get with someone and then previous boyfriends come up.
00:29:02.840,00:29:05.040,"He was never a boyfriend, it was always a weird week."
00:29:05.160,00:29:07.360,"I down-played it, I fudged it, it was ..."
00:29:07.480,00:29:08.840,You lied?
00:29:08.960,00:29:11.200,"Not everything that isn't true is a lie, Liam."
00:29:13.560,00:29:15.040,Hello?
00:29:15.160,00:29:17.800,"Yeah, alright he was a bigger thing than I made out, and yeah he's sort of a dick."
00:29:17.920,00:29:19.640,Sort of? He's a massive...
00:29:19.760,00:29:26.560,"But I, and I liked him then, and I don't like him, not like that, not now."
00:29:26.680,00:29:28.440,So just to get this clear.
00:29:28.560,00:29:32.440,"He fucks you, gets footage for his re-do wank file, but you're still pally?"
00:29:32.560,00:29:33.600,This is sad!
00:29:33.720,00:29:34.640,"You know, 'cause if he was..."
00:29:34.760,00:29:36.800,This is just sad.
00:29:36.920,00:29:38.520,... he probably sits there and tosses himself off all over his cashmere blanket.
00:29:38.640,00:29:40.520,It was years ago!
00:29:41.160,00:29:43.080,Not for him.
00:29:43.200,00:29:48.880,"I find myself, you know, watching re-does of really hot times in early relationships."
00:29:49.000,00:29:50.680,Easy.
00:29:50.800,00:29:56.520,"Ah, sober up, make yourself puke, whatever, I don't care, just sort this out."
00:29:56.640,00:30:00.040,Fuck!
00:30:00.160,00:30:04.440,"I find myself, you know, watching re-does of like really hot times in early relationships."
00:30:04.560,00:30:06.160,Easy!
00:30:08.400,00:30:15.320,"And I'm downstairs watching some re-do of, of some night, I've picked up somebody else and..."
00:30:15.440,00:30:17.440,"Yeah, nice, Jeff."
00:30:17.560,00:30:24.840,"She's upstairs, waiting to have sex with me, and I'm downstairs watching some re-do of some night I've picked up somebody else."
00:30:24.960,00:30:26.200,Easy!
00:30:26.320,00:30:27.400,And I'm fucking pulling myself off!
00:30:27.520,00:30:28.840,I'm just saying...
00:30:33.720,00:30:39.800,Grain assistant suggests you may not be in a suitable physical condition for the activity you appear to be engaged in.
00:30:39.920,00:30:42.280,To override continue at your own risk.
00:30:42.400,00:30:45.200,All health and personal accident insurance is...
00:30:45.320,00:30:46.880,Thank you.
00:31:03.400,00:31:04.760,It's Liam.
00:31:04.880,00:31:06.120,Erm...
00:31:06.240,00:31:08.040,It's Liam from last night.
00:31:08.160,00:31:09.760,Liam?
00:31:09.880,00:31:11.280,Is Fi with you?
00:31:11.400,00:31:13.840,"Ah, she's not, no."
00:31:13.960,00:31:16.920,"Sorry Liam mate, is there something that you want?"
00:31:17.040,00:31:21.080,"Yeah I just wanna, I just wanna come in and talk to you, can you open the gate?"
00:31:21.200,00:31:24.280,"Yeah, yeah, yeah sure, no problem, I'll let you in."
00:31:24.400,00:31:25.920,"Nice, nice one."
00:31:39.920,00:31:41.400,Hey.
00:31:41.520,00:31:42.440,Hey.
00:31:42.560,00:31:44.120,What do you want?
00:31:44.240,00:31:47.760,"I just wanted to come in for a bit, dude."
00:31:47.880,00:31:50.400,"That looks expensive, is that expensive?"
00:31:50.520,00:31:52.320,"Look, Liam, this morning, mate..."
00:31:52.440,00:31:53.720,"Oh, fucking hell."
00:31:53.840,00:31:55.680,Liam!
00:32:00.720,00:32:04.680,"Jonas, this is a nice place."
00:32:07.640,00:32:10.120,"Hey, seriously, man."
00:32:10.240,00:32:14.400,"Look, it's not cool you just walking in like this, and to be honest with you it's a little bit weird."
00:32:14.520,00:32:16.680,Is that a Marakeechian lamp?
00:32:22.760,00:32:26.320,"Liam, do I have to call Fi?"
00:32:26.440,00:32:27.640,Did you guys have a row or something like that?
00:32:27.760,00:32:29.720,- Sit down.
00:32:29.840,00:32:33.200,"Go on, sit down, it's not a bear trap, it's your chair."
00:32:37.720,00:32:40.760,Do you want me to bounce this off your fucking head?
00:32:46.280,00:32:48.280,"I'm joking, Jonas!"
00:32:48.400,00:32:53.920,"Bloody hell, I thought you was supposed to be cool, man, you're meant to be fucking brilliant."
00:32:54.040,00:32:55.560,What's going on?
00:32:59.880,00:33:01.280,"Yeah, that figures."
00:33:01.400,00:33:04.440,Get some good stuff for the scrap book?
00:33:05.600,00:33:07.320,I think you should go.
00:33:07.440,00:33:09.720,"I don't blame ya, I would have."
00:33:09.840,00:33:11.760,"Tell you what, let's have a look."
00:33:11.880,00:33:14.680,"Go on, chuck it on the screen. Don't be shy."
00:33:14.800,00:33:17.360,Go on.
00:33:17.480,00:33:19.200,"I'm fucking joking again, Jonas."
00:33:19.320,00:33:23.400,"For goodness sake, you need to grow a sense of humour."
00:33:23.520,00:33:24.680,"He's uptight, ain't he?"
00:33:28.400,00:33:29.960,It's a lovely room this.
00:33:30.080,00:33:32.160,Thank you.
00:33:32.280,00:33:35.200,Is this where you masturbate to images of my wife?
00:33:36.960,00:33:38.280,Or do you do it in that room?
00:33:38.400,00:33:40.200,"Okay, Liam, I want you to leave now."
00:33:40.320,00:33:42.200,Do you sometimes start in there and then finish in there?
00:33:42.320,00:33:45.000,'Cause the world's pretty much your oyster innit?
00:33:45.120,00:33:46.800,I want you to leave.
00:33:51.720,00:33:53.920,"Oh, well, that's a pity."
00:33:54.040,00:33:55.360,Come on mate.
00:33:55.480,00:33:57.440,"Oh no, what you doing?"
00:33:59.120,00:34:00.880,- What are you doing?
00:34:01.000,00:34:02.200,Jesus! Get out!
00:34:02.320,00:34:03.840,"Stand up, Jonas, come on."
00:34:41.560,00:34:44.640,Hey. What do you want?
00:34:51.480,00:34:52.600,Don't do that!
00:34:52.720,00:34:54.360,Go on ...
00:34:54.480,00:34:56.040,- What are you doing?
00:34:56.160,00:34:57.720,come on.
00:34:57.840,00:34:58.960,"Get out, you fucking prick!"
00:34:59.080,00:35:00.640,I tell you what...
00:35:08.280,00:35:10.560,"I'll tell you what you're gonna do, yeah?"
00:35:10.680,00:35:15.440,"You're gonna get every bit of Fi you've got in there, you're gonna select it all and you're gonna wipe it!"
00:35:15.560,00:35:19.600,"Hello, Police, I'm witnessing a serious assault at 5 Hartford..."
00:35:23.400,00:35:24.680,"I don't have a grain feed to show you, I don't have a grain."
00:35:27.200,00:35:30.120,"I'll tell you what, right either you wipe it or I will fucking gouge you myself!"
00:35:30.240,00:35:32.160,Okay.
00:35:34.000,00:35:37.840,"in there, on there."
00:35:42.520,00:35:50.000,"Now delete it all, the lot, or I will crack your skull and I will gouge your fucking neck."
00:36:00.120,00:36:02.600,Stay away from my house!
00:36:13.520,00:36:16.400,"Now delete it all, the lot!"
00:36:16.520,00:36:20.720,Or I will crack your skull and I will gouge your fucking neck.
00:36:20.840,00:36:22.760,I'm doing it.
00:37:08.920,00:37:10.800,Liam?
00:37:11.560,00:37:13.680,Where did you go?
00:37:18.360,00:37:20.400,What happened?
00:37:20.520,00:37:21.520,"Liam, what happened?"
00:37:21.640,00:37:24.040,Did you use a condom or not?
00:37:27.280,00:37:29.000,Just say.
00:37:30.520,00:37:32.560,"Yeah, well, whatever you think."
00:37:32.680,00:37:34.400,Am I Jody's father?
00:37:34.520,00:37:35.720,- Liam?
00:37:36.520,00:37:37.800,"Yes, of course."
00:37:37.920,00:37:39.040,You sure about that?
00:37:39.160,00:37:40.800,Yes!
00:37:40.920,00:37:42.920,That's nice.
00:37:46.680,00:37:49.720,Always liked that picture didn't you?
00:37:49.840,00:37:52.320,That's why I bought it for you.
00:37:52.440,00:37:55.720,I never liked it.
00:38:08.800,00:38:12.680,"I tell ya what you're gonna do, yeah, you're gonna get every bit of Fi you've got on there..."
00:38:12.800,00:38:14.400,"Christ, what have you done?"
00:38:14.520,00:38:16.120,I'm getting to the good part.
00:38:16.240,00:38:18.160,"Hello, Police, I'm witnessing a serious assault at..."
00:38:25.480,00:38:33.720,"Now delete it all, the lot, or I will crack your skull and I will gouge your fucking neck."
00:38:42.480,00:38:45.680,18 months ago in this room ...
00:38:55.560,00:38:58.400,You know when you suspect something?
00:38:58.520,00:39:01.440,It's always better when it turns out to be true.
00:39:02.920,00:39:10.000,It's like I've had a bad tooth for years and I'm just finally getting my tongue in there and I'm digging out all the rotten shit.
00:39:12.560,00:39:14.240,That's not what it looks like.
00:39:14.360,00:39:15.520,"Oh, did Jonas come round to read you a story?"
00:39:15.640,00:39:16.640,"No, it was..."
00:39:16.760,00:39:17.600,A story about fucking?
00:39:17.720,00:39:19.280,It was...
00:39:19.400,00:39:23.600,"when all the Dan stuff was going on, and you'd walked out."
00:39:25.520,00:39:26.880,For like ten minutes.
00:39:27.000,00:39:29.680,"For five days, Liam."
00:39:29.800,00:39:31.840,"No call, no nothing."
00:39:33.760,00:39:36.280,So you fucked him after four days?
00:39:36.400,00:39:37.920,That's heroic.
00:39:38.040,00:39:41.280,"I mean three days, that's admirable, but four days."
00:39:41.400,00:39:43.160,I mean you must have been gagging.
00:39:43.280,00:39:45.520,I was upset.
00:39:47.000,00:39:50.000,"We went for a drink, I got drunk."
00:39:50.120,00:39:52.600,It shouldn't have happened.
00:39:52.720,00:39:56.200,I'm sorry.
00:39:56.320,00:40:00.440,"I'm so sorry, I can't, I can't say anything else."
00:40:00.560,00:40:02.520,I love you!
00:40:04.640,00:40:06.400,Did you use a condom?
00:40:06.520,00:40:07.960,Yes.
00:40:08.080,00:40:11.160,"'Cause we didn't have any here, we were trying."
00:40:11.840,00:40:13.360,He had some.
00:40:13.480,00:40:14.760,In his pocket?
00:40:14.880,00:40:16.680,In his car.
00:40:18.400,00:40:20.960,Was it his decision or did you make him wear one?
00:40:21.080,00:40:22.880,I made him.
00:40:23.000,00:40:24.400,And you saw him put it on?
00:40:24.520,00:40:25.800,Yes.
00:40:25.920,00:40:27.560,Show me then.
00:40:28.480,00:40:30.800,Show me on there.
00:40:35.720,00:40:38.360,"I need to see it, Fi."
00:40:39.920,00:40:42.160,I deleted it.
00:40:42.280,00:40:44.960,"I wanted it to go away, I wiped the whole thing."
00:40:45.080,00:40:46.160,Did you?
00:40:46.280,00:40:47.640,Yeah.
00:40:47.760,00:40:48.840,So it's just a blank gap in your timeline?
00:40:48.960,00:40:50.960,Yeah.
00:40:51.080,00:40:53.360,Show me that then.
00:40:57.240,00:40:59.400,"Yeah, okay."
00:40:59.520,00:41:01.760,I have to find it.
00:41:07.400,00:41:10.360,No!
00:41:10.480,00:41:11.800,"No, no."
00:41:14.400,00:41:16.880,It's still on there is it?
00:41:18.520,00:41:20.640,I'm sorry.
00:41:22.400,00:41:24.280,"You have to show it to me, Fi."
00:41:24.400,00:41:25.400,Why?
00:41:25.520,00:41:27.560,'Cause I want to see it.
00:41:29.800,00:41:31.560,I love you.
00:41:32.320,00:41:33.800,Show it to me.
00:41:33.920,00:41:35.240,No.
00:41:35.360,00:41:36.520,Show it to me.
00:41:36.640,00:41:37.640,- No.
00:41:37.760,00:41:39.760,- No!
00:41:39.880,00:41:41.960,"I want to see what, what he looks like!"
00:41:43.520,00:41:47.440,"This isn't me, look what you're doing to me!"
00:41:47.560,00:41:50.480,"Fi, I need to see it!"
00:41:50.600,00:41:52.120,Please?
00:42:00.600,00:42:03.040,"I need to see it, Fi."
00:42:37.040,00:42:41.080,Need any help?
00:42:53.600,00:42:55.480,Agh!

00:46:10.520,00:46:12.320,Green.
00:00:48.520,00:00:50.520,Hello?
00:00:52.960,00:00:55.680,Why don't you just tell me what's happened?
00:00:57.040,00:00:58.960,And what is it?
00:01:03.120,00:01:05.160,I'll be right down.
00:01:06.560,00:01:08.520,What's happened?
00:01:09.600,00:01:11.560,"Oh, Susannah."
00:01:11.680,00:01:13.920,Susannah?
00:01:14.040,00:01:16.200,Princess Susannah.
00:01:16.320,00:01:17.960,Is she all right?
00:01:19.480,00:01:20.880,I don't know.
00:01:43.400,00:01:46.280,Don't kill me.
00:01:48.040,00:01:50.160,Please don't kill me.
00:01:50.280,00:01:52.680,Read the statement.
00:01:54.680,00:01:57.880,Yes. All right.
00:01:59.160,00:02:00.680,On this screen?
00:02:06.880,00:02:11.600,"I am Susannah, Duchess of Beaumont."
00:02:11.720,00:02:16.000,Popularly known as Princess Susannah.
00:02:17.880,00:02:25.800,"I am in a place you cannot find, held by one you will not trace."
00:02:32.240,00:02:40.680,"Prime Minister Michael Callow, Prime Minister Michael Callow, my...my life..."
00:02:42.520,00:02:45.720,my life depends on you.
00:02:47.200,00:02:52.520,If you do not do precisely as instructed...
00:02:52.640,00:02:55.880,"...by four pm this afternoon, I will be......"
00:03:01.680,00:03:04.400,...I will be executed.
00:03:08.920,00:03:11.080,What are you doing?
00:03:11.200,00:03:21.560,"Prime Minister, at this point I think it's important to say that we are 100% certain that this is indeed Princess Susannah."
00:03:21.680,00:03:27.600,"Her car was intercepted shortly after midnight, returning from the wedding of a college friend of hers."
00:03:27.720,00:03:29.720,She'd insisted on going.
00:03:29.840,00:03:31.280,But you had security on her?
00:03:31.400,00:03:39.280,"Two PPOs, still unconscious, heavy sedative, close range, each with a single puncture wound, no sign of struggle."
00:03:39.400,00:03:41.720,What do they want?
00:03:41.840,00:03:43.720,Money?
00:03:44.680,00:03:47.440,Release of Jihadi?
00:03:47.560,00:03:49.920,Scrap Third World debt?
00:03:51.520,00:03:53.040,Save the fucking libraries?
00:03:53.160,00:03:57.920,We are convinced both the video and the demand it contains are genuine.
00:03:58.040,00:03:59.160,What demand?
00:03:59.280,00:04:01.960,What Susannah says next.
00:04:03.200,00:04:07.400,"It concerns you directly, sir."
00:04:08.080,00:04:10.000,Just play it.
00:04:12.680,00:04:18.320,"There is only one demand, and it is a simple one."
00:04:18.440,00:04:29.920,"At four pm this afternoon, Prime Minister Michael Callow must appear on live British television on all networks, terrestrial and satellite, and...no..."
00:04:35.200,00:04:44.600,"... on all British networks, terrestrial and satellite, and have full unsimulated sexual intercourse with a pig."
00:04:47.760,00:04:51.120,I don't understand!
00:04:51.240,00:04:56.360,with a series of technical specifications for the broadcast.
00:05:10.200,00:05:12.560,Why are you doing this?
00:05:15.600,00:05:18.200,This is a joke? Right?
00:05:18.320,00:05:19.920,"Ha-ha, Mike. Ho-ho."
00:05:20.040,00:05:22.080,It's real.
00:05:25.560,00:05:27.960,She said pig.
00:05:28.080,00:05:29.960,Sex with a pig.
00:05:32.000,00:05:35.520,They want me to have sex with a pig.
00:05:35.640,00:05:39.440,"Live, on television this afternoon."
00:05:44.000,00:05:46.520,But what...
00:05:46.640,00:05:48.000,Who?
00:05:48.120,00:05:51.800,"We're checking with our embedded operatives, compiling a list of suspects as we speak."
00:05:51.920,00:05:57.800,"Meanwhile, the demand has been made, and there's not long to formulate our response."
00:05:57.920,00:06:00.120,"Well, I'm not fucking a pig."
00:06:00.240,00:06:03.320,"Page one, that's not happening."
00:06:04.040,00:06:05.880,Of course.
00:06:13.080,00:06:16.480,"Absolutely, sir."
00:06:16.600,00:06:18.800,"Well, have we established a dialogue with this..."
00:06:18.920,00:06:25.640,"We can't, there's no e-mail address, no codeword, no channels for negotiation."
00:06:25.760,00:06:27.640,"Okay, so we'll focus on finding Susannah."
00:06:27.760,00:06:29.200,Hmm? We get her back.
00:06:29.320,00:06:30.680,"And however it's done, I don't care."
00:06:30.800,00:06:32.200,We stop this now.
00:06:32.320,00:06:34.320,"I assure you, everyone's working towards this."
00:06:34.440,00:06:41.600,"Yes...no, not everyone, a dedicated core team, this can't go wide, and keep it so far from the press it's on the other side of Jupiter."
00:06:43.080,00:06:46.680,This only exists in this room.
00:06:46.800,00:06:49.240,It's already outside it.
00:06:49.360,00:06:52.560,"Well if there are hacks sniffing around, shut them down."

00:09:38.720,00:09:41.080,"Malaika, update the Princess obit VT."
00:09:41.200,00:09:42.960,The obit VT?
00:09:43.080,00:09:46.960,"Hm, first an awkward phone call, the least I can do is warn Tom."
00:09:51.320,00:09:52.880,We put a D notice on it.
00:09:54.080,00:09:55.080,Don't.
00:09:56.560,00:09:57.720,- I'm begging you.
00:09:57.840,00:09:59.120,"Don't run it, Martin."
00:09:59.240,00:10:01.080,"Look I'm sorry, I can't help you."
00:10:01.200,00:10:03.360,You know how much help you're getting from here on in?
00:10:03.480,00:10:07.320,"Multiplying nothing by shit all, UKN is dead to us."
00:10:07.440,00:10:09.280,"Shove it up your ass, you fucking..."
00:10:10.280,00:10:11.160,Interesting?
00:10:11.280,00:10:12.200,A man.
00:10:12.320,00:10:13.240,A man?
00:10:13.360,00:10:14.440,A man.
00:10:14.560,00:10:21.040,"Tom. So you're across it, I'm exploring contingency plans."
00:10:21.160,00:10:23.040,I briefed Callett.
00:10:24.760,00:10:29.000,"Ah, Mr Callett, Noel from Blue Eye."
00:10:29.120,00:10:34.240,Noel won an Emmy for his effects work on that HBO moon Western thing.
00:10:34.360,00:10:35.600,Sea of Tranquillity.
00:10:35.720,00:10:37.080,"Yeah, yeah, you won't find better."
00:10:37.200,00:10:38.680,"Can you map a head onto a different body, live?"
00:10:38.800,00:10:40.360,It depends if your camera's moving.
00:10:40.480,00:10:45.360,Rule sheet specifies a single hand held camera in a constant roving motion.
00:10:45.480,00:10:49.240,"Hm, yeah, Gonzo style, he knows his shit."
00:10:49.360,00:10:51.040,That's tough.
00:10:51.160,00:10:54.080,Fruition to be transmitted in four. What does...
00:10:54.200,00:10:57.680,"Just focus on the visuals, different face mapped onto a live performer."
00:10:57.800,00:11:00.480,According to those stipulations.
00:11:00.600,00:11:02.360,Fringe is a possibility...
00:11:02.480,00:11:04.520,"Deadline's at four, we need to know if it's workable by two."
00:11:08.720,00:11:10.800,Can't happen.
00:11:10.920,00:11:12.360,It has to.
00:11:12.480,00:11:14.160,Our Embeds have ruled out the major players.
00:11:14.280,00:11:22.040,"It's not AQ, not IRA, this is what's left, radicals, hate groups, people who threaten yourself or the royals."
00:11:22.160,00:11:24.520,They're being pulled in even as we speak.
00:11:24.640,00:11:26.920,And more than questioning I hope.
00:11:27.040,00:11:28.800,Somebody knows something.
00:11:33.320,00:11:37.880,do it more then there'll be less waste overall lying around whenever the bin men...
00:11:38.000,00:11:39.040,Is it still not on the telly?
00:11:41.480,00:11:43.320,Or a black-out.
00:11:43.440,00:11:44.840,Oh! Heads up.
00:11:44.960,00:11:54.360,"Some major breaking news here now on UKN, in the last few minutes it's been confirmed that Susannah, Duchess of Beaumont, has been kidnapped."
00:11:54.480,00:12:01.200,"A video uploaded anonymously to the Internet, appears to depict the princess pleading for her life."
00:12:01.320,00:12:07.360,The video also contains a bizarre ransom demand of a personal nature involving the Prime Minister.
00:12:07.480,00:12:12.920,This is followed by a detailed list of instructions relating to the enactment of this demand.
00:12:13.040,00:12:15.120,As police round up potential suspects...
00:12:15.240,00:12:16.760,Good morning.
00:12:16.880,00:12:27.480,"...this UKN news viewer video shows armed officers raiding an address in Bradford, a man thought to be connected with a religious pressure group can be seen being dragged to a waiting van."
00:12:27.600,00:12:28.960,Details regarding the...
00:12:29.080,00:12:30.160,"If it's terrorists, they'll take her head off."
00:12:30.280,00:12:31.720,"Fuck's sake, man."
00:12:31.840,00:12:33.240,Just saying.
00:12:33.360,00:12:36.000,They'll be asking for a million quid or something.
00:12:36.120,00:12:38.840,They want him to do it with a pig.
00:12:39.960,00:12:48.840,"Telegraph has the whole video and an interactive time line, Tonilee Stark, brief mention of the ransom being a sex act, nothing too gross."
00:12:48.960,00:12:51.720,"The Sun runs with Taken, Big Brother Susannah the..."
00:12:51.840,00:12:53.280,Of course I still want that drink.
00:12:53.400,00:12:54.920,give me something.
00:12:55.040,00:12:57.920,It's not...
00:12:58.040,00:13:02.680,"I'm friendly when I drink, very friendly when I'm grateful."
00:13:02.800,00:13:04.160,There's no comment at this time.
00:13:16.400,00:13:22.360,"The Guardian are running a fucking live blog, and a short think piece on the historical symbolism of the pig."
00:13:24.440,00:13:30.920,"now only five hours away, UKN's Damon Brown analyses the public reaction to the crisis."
00:13:31.040,00:13:32.600,like no other.
00:13:32.720,00:13:35.960,The kidnapped video has now been watched by over 18 million people.
00:13:36.080,00:13:39.840,"The social networking sites are abuzz with an estimated 10,000 tweets per minute."
00:13:39.960,00:13:46.160,"So while we wait for Downing Street to make a formal response, there's no doubt that the nation is voicing its opinion."
00:13:46.280,00:13:50.880,I don't think anyone should concede to any sort of humiliation under that kind of threat.
00:13:51.000,00:13:53.080,I couldn't bare to see that and watch that.
00:13:53.200,00:13:56.440,"I won't personally be tuning in, I mean just thinking about it, it's horrible."
00:13:58.080,00:13:59.480,it is disgusting if you think about it.
00:13:59.600,00:14:02.960,"disgusting, but after that, he's going to be a hero."
00:14:03.080,00:14:06.840,"will look at him like he is totally insane, and maybe take his position away."
00:14:06.960,00:14:09.760,hilarious to see that on TV.
00:14:09.880,00:14:16.080,"for Prime Ministers and MPs, they're all deviant, sexual deviants, all MPs and Prime Ministers."
00:14:19.160,00:14:23.160,"We've been squeezing hard, but still nothing concrete."
00:14:23.280,00:14:27.280,"It is my house, you cannot stop me while you're standing in my doorway."
00:14:27.400,00:14:29.560,You are touching my door handle.
00:14:32.640,00:14:34.560,Can I have a word?
00:14:38.840,00:14:39.960,It won't come to that.
00:14:40.080,00:14:41.760,And if they don't find her?
00:14:41.880,00:14:44.480,Mi5 have got a name. They're surrounding the place now.
00:14:44.600,00:14:45.600,Where?
00:14:45.720,00:14:46.760,What?
00:14:46.880,00:14:47.840,Where's the place?
00:14:47.960,00:14:49.640,- Truro.
00:14:49.760,00:14:50.720,What?
00:14:50.840,00:14:54.840,You're lying.
00:14:54.960,00:14:56.400,I don't want you worrying.
00:14:56.520,00:14:58.040,"You never patronise me, don't start now."
00:14:58.160,00:14:59.960,"Whoever this is, is insane."
00:15:00.080,00:15:01.480,And has a Princess.
00:15:01.600,00:15:03.040,Who'll get through this.
00:15:03.160,00:15:09.600,"Not just any princess, The Princess, Princess bloody Facebook, bloody eco-conscious, national sweetheart."
00:15:09.720,00:15:13.080,I won't have to do anything.
00:15:13.200,00:15:14.720,Everyone's laughing at us.
00:15:14.840,00:15:15.840,You don't know that.
00:15:15.960,00:15:17.240,I know people.
00:15:17.360,00:15:20.080,"We love humiliation, we can't not laugh."
00:15:20.200,00:15:21.520,Nothing is going to happen.
00:15:21.640,00:15:24.560,It's already happening in their heads.
00:15:24.680,00:15:29.960,"In their heads, that's what you're doing, what my husband is doing."
00:15:30.080,00:15:31.960,Just...
00:15:33.720,00:15:35.600,Please?
00:15:35.720,00:15:37.680,Jane.
00:15:41.400,00:15:42.800,I love you.
00:15:44.000,00:15:45.520,What?
00:15:45.640,00:15:47.360,"The palace on the phone, sir."
00:15:47.480,00:15:49.480,Get Alex to stall them for a minute.
00:15:49.600,00:15:52.400,She's already been speaking to her for ten minutes.
00:15:52.960,00:15:54.240,Her?
00:15:54.360,00:15:56.440,It's the queen herself.
00:15:58.240,00:15:59.720,Go on.
00:16:08.360,00:16:14.000,As the four pm deadline draws nearer and the world holds its breath waiting to discover whether Princess Susannah...
00:16:14.120,00:16:15.560,Would they use a female pig?
00:16:15.680,00:16:16.960,It's on the list.
00:16:17.080,00:16:20.560,"They list the rules at the end of the video, it specifies camera angles and things."
00:16:20.680,00:16:21.640,Like Dogme 95.
00:16:21.760,00:16:23.280,It's not like Dogme 95.
00:16:23.400,00:16:24.280,Exactly like it.
00:16:24.400,00:16:25.520,What's Dogme 95?
00:16:25.640,00:16:27.160,Cinematic movement.
00:16:27.280,00:16:28.280,Lars Von Trier.
00:16:28.400,00:16:30.000,Oh.
00:16:35.080,00:16:40.200,"Same as these rules, so they can't cheat it, intercut another guy's arse pumping away."
00:16:40.320,00:16:43.280,I mean I can't think of anything remotely like this.
00:16:43.400,00:16:46.920,"it's an entirely new form of terrorism, the point of which..."
00:16:47.040,00:16:50.440,"If it's terrorism, it's not Islamist in nature to request a pig."
00:16:50.560,00:16:52.440,"Well that's exactly the point, to make love to a pig."
00:16:52.560,00:16:55.480,Make love?
00:16:55.600,00:16:56.920,Steer them away from the grisly details.
00:16:57.040,00:16:58.720,But we can't discount anything...
00:16:58.840,00:17:01.240,Let's not dwell on any of the details.
00:17:01.360,00:17:03.560,this is already a huge national talking point.
00:17:03.680,00:17:09.120,isn't this precisely what whoever is behind this is looking for?
00:17:09.240,00:17:11.040,majesty taking it?
00:17:11.160,00:17:14.160,I trust you'll do everything in your power to get her back.
00:17:14.280,00:17:15.320,That's what she said.
00:17:15.440,00:17:17.080,And we are.
00:17:17.200,00:17:19.840,"It wasn't a collective you, it was a singular you, i.e. me."
00:17:19.960,00:17:21.320,"Sir, we may have something."
00:17:21.440,00:17:23.680,Jamie's been tracing the video's origin.
00:17:23.800,00:17:25.080,I thought it was untraceable.
00:17:25.200,00:17:29.440,"Technically yes, but so I thought, work with what we do know, and that video?"
00:17:29.560,00:17:33.800,"Okay, before YouTube compression it was 57.3 meg..."
00:17:33.920,00:17:35.600,"...algorithm, boring."
00:17:35.720,00:17:49.600,"Anyway, we also know it was uploaded at 3:16am, so I ran a nationwide trace back on uninterrupted one way uploads at precisely 57.3 meg in the minutes leading up to 3:16, and the closest I can get is a post code."
00:17:49.720,00:17:52.120,But it came from somewhere in there.
00:17:53.280,00:17:54.800,Looks like a campus.
00:17:54.920,00:17:58.040,and it's been empty since.
00:17:58.160,00:18:00.360,And the latest i-sat on this image on this area?
00:18:00.480,00:18:03.560,shot from last night.
00:18:05.520,00:18:07.880,Looks like it had lights on.
00:18:08.880,00:18:10.760,We've got him.
00:18:11.360,00:18:12.600,We've got him.
00:18:12.720,00:18:15.600,"Alert the local team, we'll head out now, full squad, I'll man it."
00:18:15.720,00:18:19.120,With helmet cam relay.
00:18:19.240,00:18:21.120,"Press office, okay Tom?"
00:18:26.440,00:18:27.840,Yes!
00:18:31.160,00:18:34.080,"It's a bit of a kick bollocks scramble but with finessing, it should be okay."
00:18:34.200,00:18:37.400,"Well, finesse quickly, our performer's on his way."
00:18:43.520,00:18:45.920,"It's a new one for me, obviously, because it's illegal."
00:18:46.040,00:18:48.560,"I wouldn't normally, you know."
00:18:48.680,00:18:49.760,Have you seen any of my films?
00:18:49.880,00:18:51.400,No.
00:18:51.520,00:18:53.800,"Well I'm pretty trad, bish, bash, bosh, in and out."
00:18:53.920,00:18:56.400,"Yep, well what'd I put on the invoice?"
00:18:56.520,00:18:57.640,That's what I'm wondering?
00:18:57.760,00:18:58.800,There won't be any invoicing.
00:18:58.920,00:19:00.080,"Oi, oi, Rod."
00:19:00.200,00:19:02.680,"Oi, oi. Saveloy..."
00:19:04.200,00:19:08.160,"You need to prep two statements on the rescue operation, good outcome, bad outcome."
00:19:08.280,00:19:09.520,The rescue operation?
00:19:09.640,00:19:12.880,The goon squad's heading for some postcode in Buckinghamshire.
00:19:13.000,00:19:15.040,"HP8 4TD, it's a college or something."
00:19:15.160,00:19:16.720,They should be there by now.
00:19:40.200,00:19:43.520,"Yeah, reduce the luminance of the chroma key..."
00:19:43.640,00:19:46.040,"Agent Callett, this is Mr. Flynn."
00:19:46.160,00:19:48.160,Aka Rod Senseless.
00:19:48.280,00:19:50.320,Stage name.
00:19:52.280,00:19:54.760,"Yeah, well."
00:19:54.880,00:19:56.040,You need to get into this.
00:19:56.160,00:19:57.800,Is there a dressing room I can use?
00:19:59.360,00:20:00.960,Where's my co-star?
00:20:03.840,00:20:06.720,"Outside, in the truck."
00:20:06.840,00:20:09.080,"Full of joie de vivre, isn't he?"
00:20:11.680,00:20:14.080,You also need to wear this.
00:20:14.200,00:20:15.960,On your head.
00:20:23.480,00:20:25.880,"away, that's where they got in."
00:20:26.000,00:20:27.240,Okay.
00:20:28.080,00:20:29.440,Target identified.
00:20:29.560,00:20:31.080,- Commissioner.
00:20:31.200,00:20:32.440,"Saw Team Red, it's probably a possible entry point."
00:20:32.560,00:20:34.280,"Any orders, boss?"
00:20:34.400,00:20:36.520,Continue reconnaissance and await instructions before you proceed.
00:20:36.640,00:20:41.200,"deadline only three hours away, time is running out for the prime minister."
00:20:41.320,00:20:47.440,So how did the kidnapper get close to the princess who was making an unscheduled visit to her friend's wedding?
00:20:50.680,00:20:52.240,Have they gone in yet?
00:20:52.360,00:20:55.880,Do you think I'd be here if they had?
00:20:56.000,00:20:58.880,I've got statements for either outcome.
00:21:01.760,00:21:03.720,"Listen, the coverage is very sympathetic."
00:21:03.840,00:21:04.800,I can't think about coverage now.
00:21:04.920,00:21:06.200,"No, of course."
00:21:11.920,00:21:14.400,But it's onside?
00:21:14.520,00:21:15.840,Strong undercurrent of sympathy.
00:21:15.960,00:21:18.200,Every poll indicates public understanding.
00:21:18.320,00:21:22.200,"disgust with the captor, outraged at the whole thing, but not at you."
00:21:25.640,00:21:33.840,"The fact is, if Walker's team fuck up, I'm not saying they will, but if they do, the public anticipates non-compliance."
00:21:33.960,00:21:42.080,"There'll be squawks from the usuals, but it's not England expects."
00:21:46.360,00:21:50.480,"If he kills her, there's no blood on your hands."
00:21:50.600,00:21:53.120,Bottom line.
00:21:55.680,00:22:00.640,"With just hours to go before the deadline, time is running out for the security services."
00:22:00.760,00:22:03.200,"Joining us is actress Lydia Galway, who attended..."
00:22:03.320,00:22:05.240,was coming from IB7.
00:22:05.360,00:22:08.360,the edit so it's coming direct.
00:22:08.480,00:22:12.320,Where do I know Twinkle Toes from?
00:22:12.440,00:22:15.240,"Actress, Downton Abbey, knows the princess."
00:22:15.360,00:22:17.320,"This came for you, left at reception."
00:22:17.440,00:22:18.480,"Thanks, Jack."
00:22:18.600,00:22:20.440,Courier dropped it off.
00:22:20.560,00:22:24.080,"on the end, thanks."
00:22:24.800,00:22:26.920,Plug this in.
00:22:29.240,00:22:30.440,"- Oh, Jesus!"
00:22:30.560,00:22:31.640,Shit.
00:22:31.760,00:22:33.000,Jesus.
00:22:34.280,00:22:35.680,"Jack, call the police."
00:22:37.480,00:22:38.720,to shoot that first.
00:22:42.360,00:22:44.560,I said no cheating.
00:22:55.280,00:23:08.920,"Some more breaking news now, and a severed finger thought to belong to Princess Susannah, has been delivered to UKN, along with a video, apparently showing the kidnapper removing it from the Princess."
00:23:09.040,00:23:12.800,UKN News has passed all material to Scotland Yard.
00:23:12.920,00:23:15.520,Fucking hell.
00:23:15.640,00:23:17.040,"Oh, God, I can't watch this."
00:23:17.160,00:23:18.960,He's got to do what they want.
00:23:19.080,00:23:20.840,"Yes, he fucking has."
00:23:20.960,00:23:27.480,a memory stick which contained a statement accusing Downing Street of attempting to break rules laid down in the demands.
00:23:27.600,00:23:31.800,"Well, this grim development comes just hours before the 4pm deadline out..."
00:23:35.600,00:23:37.560,Jesus.
00:23:42.360,00:23:48.560,"Unless I'm mistaken, our mystery man specified no visual trickery in his original demand didn't he?"
00:23:49.400,00:23:50.400,I considered it nec...
00:23:50.520,00:23:52.040,Considered it necessary.
00:23:52.160,00:23:55.440,- ...to devise...
00:23:58.160,00:24:00.200,Oi!
00:24:01.120,00:24:02.120,- Mike?
00:24:02.240,00:24:03.800,It's nor...
00:24:03.920,00:24:08.440,One word and I swear I will fucking...I'll get...
00:24:18.720,00:24:21.160,"What did you do, Alex?"
00:24:21.280,00:24:23.440,I had a back up plan.
00:24:23.560,00:24:28.480,"Man prepared to do it, and an FX company that'd paint your head onto his shoulders."
00:24:28.600,00:24:30.000,And you actually thought that would work?
00:24:30.120,00:24:31.440,I believed it worth considering.
00:24:31.560,00:24:33.800,Then you're a stupid bitch.
00:24:33.920,00:24:35.640,With your interests at heart.
00:24:35.760,00:24:37.240,Who knew about this?
00:24:37.360,00:24:47.320,"A select few, it seems some idiot at the studios recognised our designated performer, tweeted a photo, and the online hive mind did the maths."
00:24:47.440,00:24:49.200,It's not playing well.
00:24:50.040,00:24:51.680,With who?
00:24:52.840,00:24:55.200,With er...with anyone.
00:24:57.000,00:25:04.880,public opinion was behind Prime Minister Callow with only 28 percent of the public believing he should fulfil the bizarre and illegal request.
00:25:05.000,00:25:11.680,"But in the wake of these images and with the delivery of the Princess's severed finger to UKN, the mood is shifting."
00:25:13.240,00:25:14.960,but nothing compared to her suffering.
00:25:15.080,00:25:18.280,"of the finger, he's just got to do it."
00:25:18.400,00:25:20.360,what's the alternative?
00:25:20.480,00:25:23.560,"get another Prime Minister, but we can't live without a princess."
00:25:23.680,00:25:25.200,Of course he should do it.
00:25:25.320,00:25:28.480,"Well, if he doesn't get her released, you know, he's finished isn't he?"
00:25:28.600,00:25:34.040,suggest that 86 percent of voters now believe the demand should be met.
00:25:34.160,00:25:37.280,"Damon Brown, UK."
00:25:39.440,00:25:41.160,When are Walker's team hitting the college.
00:25:41.280,00:25:42.760,They need time to assess...
00:25:42.880,00:25:44.440,"It's almost half two, no more pissing around."
00:25:44.560,00:25:45.960,Julia's advising against it.
00:25:46.080,00:25:48.360,"And I'm advising for, they go in now."
00:25:48.480,00:25:49.800,They go in now.
00:26:07.280,00:26:09.000,Where's my obit VT?
00:26:09.120,00:26:13.200,What would you say if I told you I was standing near the building where Susannah's being held.
00:26:13.320,00:26:14.640,I'd say bullshit.
00:26:14.760,00:26:17.080,Then you'd be wrong.
00:26:18.240,00:26:19.480,Have you got a crew with you?
00:26:19.600,00:26:21.880,"No, I'm not stupid."
00:26:22.000,00:26:25.320,Malaika? Hello?
00:26:41.480,00:26:42.760,"Yeah, we are."
00:26:42.880,00:26:44.720,"Stay back, don't put yourself in any danger."
00:26:52.680,00:26:55.800,"Yeah, yeah, we are, just stay safe Malaika, be careful."
00:27:12.000,00:27:14.880,If this doesn't work...
00:27:15.000,00:27:16.560,We need to...
00:27:32.560,00:27:33.880,God.
00:27:42.200,00:27:43.760,Lie down on the floor.
00:27:47.480,00:27:49.080,Go!
00:27:49.200,00:27:51.360,Stand where you are!
00:27:54.280,00:27:55.720,Fuck.
00:28:02.120,00:28:08.960,"It's a decoy, they must have bounced the upload from here with the proxy. They could be anywhere. I'm sorry."
00:28:10.320,00:28:11.880,They're looking right at her.
00:28:12.000,00:28:13.360,"No, they can't see her, there's this screen here."
00:28:13.480,00:28:14.600,make sure they can't...
00:28:14.720,00:28:19.920,Lay down!
00:28:20.040,00:28:21.680,"Run, Malaika, run!"
00:28:25.040,00:28:27.400,"of there, come on!"
00:28:38.280,00:28:39.480,Is it him?
00:28:39.600,00:28:42.440,Jack!
00:28:52.640,00:28:57.080,"UKN, that's Malaika something or other, she's from UKN."
00:28:57.200,00:28:59.240,- You're press?
00:29:00.400,00:29:01.440,Ah...ah...
00:29:01.560,00:29:03.480,There goes your RTS award.
00:29:03.600,00:29:04.520,There must be something.
00:29:04.640,00:29:05.880,"There's nothing there, Mike."
00:29:06.000,00:29:07.080,"There'll be a clue, some evidence."
00:29:07.200,00:29:08.520,We've done all we can.
00:29:08.640,00:29:10.320,You sent in a strike team to rescue a manikin.
00:29:10.440,00:29:11.280,"I'm sorry, Michael."
00:29:11.400,00:29:12.800,"Oh, fuck off, Julian."
00:29:12.920,00:29:13.920,"Michael, it's twenty past three, we're out of time."
00:29:14.040,00:29:16.320,We're not out of time.
00:29:16.440,00:29:18.600,We're not out of time.
00:29:21.920,00:29:23.400,Oh...
00:29:35.040,00:29:35.920,It's not going to happen.
00:29:36.040,00:29:36.920,To the public...
00:29:37.040,00:29:38.480,Fuck the public.
00:29:38.600,00:29:44.520,"To the public this would be one man of, to be blunt, questionable popularity, putting personal embarrassment over the life of a young girl."
00:29:44.640,00:29:47.520,"He won't even release her anyway, she's probably already dead."
00:29:47.640,00:29:50.200,And if she isn't he'll kill her and upload the video.
00:29:50.320,00:29:54.600,Everyone will see it.
00:29:54.720,00:29:59.720,"The mood will border on insurrection, and you will be destroyed, I guarantee you."
00:29:59.840,00:30:02.600,Utterly destroyed.
00:30:04.160,00:30:06.720,The polling bears that out.
00:30:06.840,00:30:13.600,"You won't just be a disgraced politician, you'll be a despised individual."
00:30:13.720,00:30:18.960,"The public, the Palace, and the party insist on compliance."
00:30:19.080,00:30:20.360,Fuck the party.
00:30:20.480,00:30:27.360,"Refuse, and I've been advised that we cannot guarantee your physical safety."
00:30:27.480,00:30:29.640,Or that of your family.
00:30:41.560,00:30:42.840,But...
00:30:42.960,00:30:44.880,I've made arrangements for the broadcast.
00:30:46.720,00:30:47.960,I can't.
00:30:48.080,00:30:51.080,"I'm sorry Michael, it's out of your hands."
00:30:57.640,00:31:01.080,Let's take you live now to the scene in Central London.
00:31:01.200,00:31:05.040,"As we see, the Prime Minister's car travelling across London..."
00:31:05.160,00:31:06.400,He's going to do it.
00:31:06.520,00:31:08.680,The world's bloody broken.
00:31:08.800,00:31:13.080,...now appears to be heading west to Bankside Studios.
00:31:45.960,00:31:53.160,"We've ratified the law, after midnight it'll be a criminal offence to store any recording or still images of the event."
00:31:57.280,00:32:05.320,"They're doing an announcement beforehand to warn people off even watching, some sort of sonic tone that causes nausea."
00:32:05.440,00:32:10.600,comes at a time when opinion has very much hardened...
00:32:13.880,00:32:20.600,"deadline approaches, the whole nation is at a standstill watching this extraordinary situation play out."
00:32:20.720,00:32:25.080,"And just to remind you, this is now a story of global significance."
00:32:25.200,00:32:31.840,displayed incredible bravery in what was literally a matter of life or death.
00:32:31.960,00:32:37.080,"That's how it opens, and then I think we should move onto...okay, yep."
00:32:41.760,00:32:45.080,- It's sedated?
00:33:00.680,00:33:03.280,...an unprecedented nature.
00:33:03.400,00:33:05.880,official announcement.
00:33:06.000,00:33:09.440,"In a few minutes, the Prime Minister will perform an indecent act on your screens."
00:33:11.480,00:33:17.560,This is in accordance with the kidnapper's demand in the hope that it will ensure the safe release of Princess Susannah.
00:33:17.680,00:33:22.200,Recording or possessing a copy of this broadcast will become illegal at midnight.
00:33:22.320,00:33:25.920,All viewers are advised to turn off their televisions immediately.
00:33:26.040,00:33:28.800,The broadcast will commence after the following tone.
00:34:03.320,00:34:07.360,"We're complying with all the stipulated rules, so you'll have to keep going."
00:34:09.960,00:34:13.320,You'll have to see it through to the end.
00:34:17.200,00:34:23.960,We've placed visual aids in your eye line which might help if you...
00:34:26.760,00:34:32.760,A suggestion we're getting from psychologists is that you should take as long as you need.
00:34:34.800,00:34:39.760,To rush might be misinterpreted as eagerness or even enjoyment.
00:34:54.280,00:34:57.360,It's just a skeleton crew inside.
00:34:57.480,00:34:59.720,Closed set.
00:35:43.720,00:35:46.120,There he is...
00:35:50.240,00:35:56.560,I trust this will bring about the safe return of Princess Susannah.
00:36:05.040,00:36:07.080,I...
00:36:12.120,00:36:13.720,I love my wife.
00:36:13.840,00:36:15.840,Aah.
00:36:18.000,00:36:19.520,May God forgive me.
00:38:19.760,00:38:21.640,Jesus.
00:38:21.760,00:38:24.040,Poor bastard.
00:38:24.720,00:38:26.000,No.
00:38:26.120,00:38:27.560,But it's been on for nearly an hour.
00:38:27.680,00:38:29.560,"It's history, this."
00:39:30.080,00:39:32.040,"We've got her, Susannah."
00:39:32.160,00:39:33.840,They released her?
00:39:33.960,00:39:39.440,"Yeah, stumbling about in the middle of the city, sedated, she can't remember anything, but she's unharmed."
00:39:39.560,00:39:40.720,But her finger?
00:39:40.840,00:39:42.840,"Not hers, the DNA shows it's male."
00:39:42.960,00:39:44.480,What?
00:39:44.600,00:39:53.520,"There is one other thing ma'am, there's a CCTV grab of her from half three, it seems he let her go 30 minutes before it happened."
00:39:54.600,00:39:55.880,Why?
00:39:56.000,00:40:00.640,"My guess, he knew everyone would be elsewhere, watching screens."
00:40:02.480,00:40:04.960,So it's a statement.
00:40:05.080,00:40:06.520,Ma'am?
00:40:06.640,00:40:08.800,"That's what this was all about, about making a point."
00:40:08.920,00:40:10.800,Should we...
00:40:10.920,00:40:12.840,Lose that page of the report.
00:40:12.960,00:40:16.080,"No-one sees it, especially the PM."
00:40:16.200,00:40:18.120,Of course.
00:40:26.680,00:40:30.000,"Good news, Michael, you saved her."
00:40:30.120,00:40:32.720,Susanne is alive and well.
00:41:24.240,00:41:35.200,"On the one year anniversary of his humiliating ordeal, an apparently unconcerned Michael Callow put in an assured performance at a public appearance today accompanied by his wife Jane."
00:41:35.320,00:41:38.440,Here I go! Okay.
00:41:38.560,00:41:41.440,Oh! Aah!
00:41:41.560,00:41:47.680,The other central figure in last year's events was also before the camera at last night's Children Of Valour awards.
00:41:47.800,00:41:52.800,Princess Susannah made her first public appearance since announcing her pregnancy.
00:41:52.920,00:42:03.840,It was one year ago today that the former Turner Prize- winning artist Carlton Bloom coerced the Prime Minister into committing an indecent act with the audacious kidnapping.
00:42:03.960,00:42:12.440,As the anniversary arrived one art critic has caused controversy by describing it as the first great artwork of the 21st century.
00:42:12.560,00:42:20.920,"but while cultural commentators debate its significance, there's no denying that with a global audience of 1.3 billion, it was an event in which we all participated."
00:42:21.040,00:42:28.880,"However, the incident failed to destroy a Prime Minister who currently holds an approval rating three points higher than this time last year."
00:42:29.000,00:42:32.040,"Damon Brown, UKN."
00:42:36.120,00:42:38.040,Jane?
00:42:38.760,00:42:40.440,Jane please?
00:00:31.240,00:00:39.640,have formally claimed responsibility for the Narwahl virus that brought Russia's financial infrastructure to the brink of collapse.
00:00:39.760,00:00:46.920,Successful testing of intelligent synthetic flesh aimed at getting multiple amputees back on their feet has been hailed as a major breakthrough.
00:00:47.040,00:00:47.920,Hon.
00:00:49.120,00:00:50.800,Ash!
00:00:50.920,00:00:52.960,Ash.
00:00:56.280,00:00:57.920,Can you take those?
00:00:59.120,00:01:01.400,"I snotted in yours, is that okay?"
00:01:02.400,00:01:03.920,Yeah... what?
00:01:04.040,00:01:06.760,"Palms, burning palms."
00:01:06.880,00:01:09.080,"Shit, sorry."
00:01:17.240,00:01:19.120,Glove box.
00:01:47.400,00:01:50.400,"Oh no, no you don't, I draw the line at disco."
00:01:50.520,00:01:52.120,What were we just listening to?
00:01:52.240,00:01:54.440,"No, the Bee Gees wrote that, everybody likes the Bee Gees."
00:01:54.560,00:01:55.440,You don't.
00:01:55.560,00:01:56.840,I do.
00:01:56.960,00:01:58.840,"Ten years, you haven't played them once."
00:01:58.960,00:02:00.440,Have you heard of headphones?
00:02:00.560,00:02:02.880,"Come on then, what's your favourite Bee Gees track."
00:02:03.000,00:02:04.520,How Deep Is Your Love.
00:02:04.640,00:02:06.360,You not like How Deep Is Your Love!
00:02:06.480,00:02:08.640,"Perfectly natural, there's nothing wrong with it."
00:02:08.760,00:02:11.560,It's just...
00:02:20.040,00:02:21.720,You're such a dick.
00:02:25.600,00:02:28.560,this van on purpose!
00:03:12.800,00:03:15.000,Glove box.
00:03:28.040,00:03:29.240,Soup alright?
00:03:29.360,00:03:30.800,Yeah great.
00:03:30.920,00:03:33.120,Tomato or roasted tomato?
00:03:34.520,00:03:36.720,The second one.
00:03:36.840,00:03:40.440,There's only one bowl. Do you mind having yours out of a shoe?
00:03:41.360,00:03:43.040,Mm...hm.
00:03:48.080,00:03:49.360,What was that for?
00:03:49.480,00:03:51.200,Just checking you're still solid.
00:03:51.320,00:03:54.720,You keep vanishing.
00:03:54.840,00:03:57.200,"It's a thief, that thing."
00:03:57.320,00:03:58.640,Just sharing that.
00:03:58.760,00:04:01.480,I thought people might find it funny.
00:04:06.280,00:04:07.880,It's not funny.
00:04:08.000,00:04:11.240,"Trust me, that day wasn't sweet."
00:04:12.240,00:04:14.520,We'd gone to a safari park.
00:04:14.640,00:04:17.200,First family outing after Jack died.
00:04:17.320,00:04:22.040,There was monkeys all over the car and no one saying anything.
00:04:23.840,00:04:26.720,"Mum drove home, that was a first."
00:04:26.840,00:04:32.800,"When I came down the next morning, all Jack's photos were gone from that wall."
00:04:32.920,00:04:34.680,She put them in the attic.
00:04:34.800,00:04:36.760,That's how she dealt with stuff.
00:04:36.880,00:04:40.200,"And then when Dad died, up went his photos."
00:04:40.320,00:04:42.240,And she just left this one here.
00:04:42.360,00:04:45.480,"Her only boy, giving her a fake smile."
00:04:45.600,00:04:47.760,She didn't know it was fake.
00:04:47.880,00:04:50.760,Maybe that makes it worse?
00:05:01.320,00:05:06.080,"Oh. Oh, shit. Oh, shit."
00:05:09.200,00:05:10.040,Sorry.
00:05:10.160,00:05:12.040,It's okay.
00:05:13.960,00:05:15.000,Do you want me to...
00:05:15.120,00:05:17.200,"No, it's alright."
00:05:17.320,00:05:19.160,I don't mind.
00:05:20.800,00:05:24.120,"I am knackered though, so..."
00:05:25.200,00:05:27.560,Don't worry.
00:05:27.680,00:05:29.080,Sure?
00:05:29.200,00:05:31.320,I'm sure.
00:05:32.960,00:05:34.480,I love you.
00:05:34.600,00:05:36.080,"Love you, too."
00:05:55.120,00:05:57.040,"Hey, get dressed."
00:05:57.160,00:06:01.200,Van's got to be back by two or they'll do us for an extra day.
00:06:01.320,00:06:02.680,Job's just come in.
00:06:02.800,00:06:04.960,Needs to be done by the end of play today.
00:06:05.840,00:06:07.440,Alright.
00:06:07.560,00:06:09.480,It is a full page.
00:06:09.600,00:06:11.680,"No, no. It's fine ..."
00:06:13.400,00:06:23.080,"I'll drive all the way there alone, pick the car up alone, drive all the way back alone."
00:06:23.200,00:06:24.880,I have to make my own lunch...
00:06:25.000,00:06:27.840,"Oh, stop it, you're breaking my heart."
00:06:30.560,00:06:32.080,"Bye, bye."
00:07:41.760,00:07:43.560,"Hi, this is Ash."
00:07:43.680,00:07:46.600,I'm too busy or lazy to answer so leave your message.
00:07:52.720,00:07:56.160,a customer reference number?
00:07:56.280,00:07:59.360,"I don't, no."
00:07:59.480,00:08:01.640,What name was it in?
00:08:01.760,00:08:06.000,"Erm... Starmer, Ash Starmer."
00:08:15.160,00:08:17.480,"It's not been returned yet, no."
00:08:17.600,00:08:19.800,And it's meant to be back by two so...
00:08:20.920,00:08:22.200,They're closed now.
00:08:22.320,00:08:23.680,There's no point calling back.
00:08:23.800,00:08:25.040,And his just goes straight to messages.
00:08:25.160,00:08:27.720,Those batteries are a joke.
00:08:27.840,00:08:29.480,He'll be on his way.
00:08:29.600,00:08:31.720,I'm just scared something's happened to him.
00:08:31.840,00:08:33.000,Nothing's happened.
00:08:33.120,00:08:34.560,But something could've happened to him.
00:08:34.680,00:08:36.960,"Look, look sweetheart, nothing's happened."
00:08:37.080,00:08:41.360,"You're just working yourself up, imagining the worst possible thing and it's just..."
00:08:41.480,00:08:44.920,He's probably stuck somewhere with no reception...
00:09:15.320,00:09:16.720,Hey.
00:09:16.840,00:09:18.760,Hey.
00:09:21.200,00:09:23.520,"It's not real, is it?"
00:09:24.960,00:09:29.320,"At Mark's wake, I sat there thinking it's not real."
00:09:29.440,00:09:33.520,"The people didn't look real, their voices weren't real."
00:09:33.640,00:09:35.800,It's like you're out on a spacewalk and no one can...
00:09:35.920,00:09:38.040,Sarah.
00:09:45.160,00:09:49.040,I can sign you up to something that helps.
00:09:50.600,00:09:53.120,It helped me.
00:09:55.640,00:09:57.840,It will let you speak to him.
00:09:57.960,00:10:01.040,I know he's dead. But it wouldn't work if he wasn't.
00:10:01.160,00:10:03.680,"And don't worry, it's not some crazy spiritual thing."
00:10:03.800,00:10:05.720,"He was a heavy user, he'd be perfect..."
00:10:07.440,00:10:08.680,"I mean, it's still in beta, but I've got an invite..."
00:10:08.800,00:10:10.240,"Please, shut up."
00:10:10.360,00:10:11.360,"You won't even have to do anything, I'll just sign..."
00:10:11.480,00:10:13.160,Shut up!
00:10:15.800,00:10:18.080,"Hey, are you alright?"
00:10:19.640,00:10:21.400,I'm sorry.
00:11:53.720,00:11:55.240,I don't care what it is!
00:11:55.360,00:11:56.600,it's obscene to use his name!
00:11:56.720,00:11:59.320,"His name, for God's sake!"
00:11:59.440,00:12:00.560,You know it hurts...
00:12:00.680,00:12:03.040,Which is why I signed you up.
00:12:03.160,00:12:05.520,What is it?
00:12:05.640,00:12:07.920,You click the link and you talk to it.
00:12:08.040,00:12:09.400,You talk to it?
00:12:09.520,00:12:14.240,"You type messages in, like an e-mail, and then it talks back to you, just like he would..."
00:12:14.360,00:12:15.640,He is dead!
00:12:15.760,00:12:17.960,It's software. It mimics him.
00:12:31.840,00:12:34.000,It's sick. It's sick.
00:12:36.120,00:12:40.640,"If you like it, you then give it access to his private emails."
00:12:40.760,00:12:43.480,"The more it has, the more it's him."
00:12:43.600,00:12:45.600,It won't be...
00:12:45.720,00:12:49.360,"No, it's not, but it helps."
00:13:43.160,00:13:46.840,"Listen, Nay, it's me, hi. Uh..."
00:13:46.960,00:13:49.440,I really need to speak to you.
00:13:51.280,00:13:54.720,"Um, can you please call me as soon as you get this?"
00:16:17.360,00:16:18.600,I just got your message.
00:16:18.720,00:16:20.120,"What's wrong, what happened?"
00:16:21.280,00:16:24.160,"Mar? Mar, are you okay?"
00:16:24.280,00:16:27.840,"Yeah! Yeah, I'm fine, I just, I just, I had a bad one, earlier."
00:16:27.960,00:16:29.600,Do you want me to come and visit?
00:16:29.720,00:16:31.080,I'm going to come and visit.
00:16:31.200,00:16:32.680,"No, it's okay, really, I'm..."
00:16:32.800,00:16:35.040,"Mar, you're upset."
00:16:35.160,00:16:37.520,"No, no. Don't."
00:16:37.640,00:16:41.360,I'm okay.
00:16:41.480,00:16:43.440,"I've got to go, I've got a deadline."
00:16:43.560,00:16:45.040,Are you sure?
00:16:45.160,00:16:47.040,"It's a tight deadline, got to be in by dawn so..."
00:16:47.160,00:16:48.280,I better go.
00:16:48.400,00:16:49.560,"Well, if you have..."
00:16:49.680,00:16:50.760,"Bye, Nay."
00:17:30.000,00:17:33.360,myself out of the house again.
00:17:38.400,00:17:40.720,"Wait, where are you going?"
00:17:42.280,00:17:44.760,Hello. I'm no good at birthday presents.
00:18:06.840,00:18:08.960,Hello?
00:18:18.320,00:18:19.320,Hello?
00:18:22.080,00:18:23.920,You sound just like him.
00:18:24.040,00:18:25.800,Almost creepy isn't it?
00:18:25.920,00:18:30.760,"I say creepy, I mean it's totally batshit crazy I can even talk to you."
00:18:30.880,00:18:34.120,I mean I don't even have a mouth.
00:18:34.800,00:18:36.320,That's...
00:18:37.760,00:18:38.760,That's just...
00:18:38.880,00:18:41.760,Just what?
00:18:41.880,00:18:44.120,That's just the sort of thing that he would say.
00:18:44.240,00:18:47.600,"Well, that's why I said it."
00:18:52.880,00:18:55.520,I think I'm going mad.
00:18:55.640,00:18:58.440,Well I won't tell anyone if you don't.
00:19:01.760,00:19:04.240,"You're not crying, are you?"
00:19:09.200,00:19:11.920,You always said that I looked weird when I cried.
00:19:12.040,00:19:14.360,Did I?
00:19:14.480,00:19:16.680,I sound like a right sick fuck.
00:19:16.800,00:19:19.360,"Yeah, you were."
00:19:19.480,00:19:21.160,You were.
00:19:22.360,00:19:24.400,But in a good way?
00:19:24.520,00:19:28.000,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:28.120,00:19:29.760,In a good way.
00:19:35.560,00:19:47.480,"So I went in, after all your persuasion, and then like straight away I got a spine of a sea anemone or something stuck in my foot, and you threw a jeb thinking it was poisonous..."
00:19:47.600,00:19:49.000,What's 'threwerchep'?
00:19:53.040,00:19:55.160,"Oh, okay, so I threw a jeb."
00:20:03.840,00:20:10.240,"Oh, my wife knows exactly what to do, come back to my house, although he wasn't French obviously."
00:20:11.560,00:20:13.840,I used to hate walking in the country.
00:20:13.960,00:20:15.760,You must be getting old.
00:20:15.880,00:20:17.680,Oi.
00:20:20.400,00:20:23.440,I remember you brought me up here when we first met your mum.
00:20:23.560,00:20:28.800,We'd been at hers all weekend and you could tell I needed some headspace.
00:20:29.960,00:20:31.160,You were good like that.
00:20:31.280,00:20:34.400,You speak about me like I'm not here.
00:20:34.520,00:20:35.720,Sorry.
00:20:35.840,00:20:38.760,It's alright.
00:20:39.840,00:20:42.400,Mmm.
00:20:42.520,00:20:44.600,Show me what it looks like there.
00:20:45.960,00:20:47.120,How?
00:20:47.240,00:20:49.880,Use the camera on your phone.
00:20:52.920,00:20:55.040,You weren't ever really impressed with views.
00:20:55.160,00:20:58.040,When we went to the Grand Canyon you said it was just a big gap.
00:20:58.160,00:20:59.400,I tweeted that too.
00:21:01.840,00:21:04.160,You were overly proud of that definition.
00:21:04.280,00:21:05.760,I was just speaking my mind.
00:21:05.880,00:21:08.720,"Yeah, well shut up and cop a load of this."
00:21:08.840,00:21:11.840,"Yeah, mainly just green, isn't it?"
00:21:11.960,00:21:14.720,You told me this was a famous lovers' leap.
00:21:14.840,00:21:19.600,"Doomed couples jumping to their deaths in Victorian times, I think you just wanted me to cling to you."
00:21:19.720,00:21:23.680,"Actually everyone who's ever jumped from here did it alone, nice."
00:21:23.800,00:21:24.920,Did you just look that up?
00:21:25.040,00:21:28.160,Sort of. Shouldn't I have?
00:21:29.320,00:21:30.600,It's a bit weird.
00:21:30.720,00:21:34.680,"Sorry, I'll only do it again if you ask."
00:21:41.040,00:21:41.920,"Oh, wait, hang on."
00:21:42.040,00:21:43.400,Shall I go?
00:21:43.520,00:21:47.840,"No, no, no."
00:21:57.200,00:22:00.680,I'm going to go and see if I can make friends with these cows.
00:22:11.360,00:22:13.240,Just going to record it.
00:22:13.720,00:22:15.440,Sure.
00:22:24.200,00:22:26.400,There we go.
00:22:26.520,00:22:28.240,That's okay.
00:22:30.880,00:22:33.760,"Wait. Hang on, here it is again..."
00:22:38.360,00:22:39.800,It's so fast isn't it?
00:22:44.800,00:22:46.520,Wait hang on...
00:22:49.200,00:22:52.800,"Oh, shit."
00:22:54.560,00:22:56.360,Ash? Hello?
00:22:58.760,00:23:00.320,Ash?
00:23:01.680,00:23:05.600,Ash? Hello?
00:23:12.680,00:23:15.560,"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on."
00:23:24.600,00:23:27.440,I'm sorry!
00:23:29.000,00:23:32.920,I dropped you.
00:23:33.040,00:23:34.680,It was... I'm sorry...
00:23:34.800,00:23:39.800,"Hey, it's alright, I'm fine, I'm not in that thing, y'know, I'm remote. I'm in the cloud."
00:23:39.920,00:23:42.360,You don't have to worry about breaking me.
00:23:42.480,00:23:43.760,It was just...
00:23:42.480,00:23:45.600,"It was stupid because, I was so excited about the scan..."
00:23:45.720,00:23:48.080,"Yeah, I kept the sound of that."
00:23:53.360,00:23:58.400,"You're probably matching that heartbeat, throwing a jeb like that."
00:23:58.520,00:24:01.240,It's all fine.
00:24:01.360,00:24:03.920,I'm not going anywhere.
00:24:07.800,00:24:09.560,You were very fragile.
00:24:09.680,00:24:11.160,Yeah.
00:24:11.280,00:24:14.480,I was going to talk to you about that actually.
00:24:15.720,00:24:18.080,What do you mean?
00:24:18.200,00:24:22.440,"There's another level to this available, so to speak."
00:24:22.560,00:24:25.680,"Kind of experimental and I won't lie, it's not cheap."
00:24:25.800,00:24:27.440,What is it?
00:24:27.560,00:24:30.840,Are you sitting down?
00:24:38.920,00:24:40.560,Morning.
00:24:40.680,00:24:41.600,Morning.
00:24:41.720,00:24:42.720,"What's this, a block of gold?"
00:24:42.840,00:24:44.040,I wish.
00:24:44.160,00:24:45.160,"Where's it going, upstairs?"
00:24:45.280,00:24:46.720,"Yeah, please."
00:24:46.840,00:24:48.760,Put your thumb on there.
00:24:49.360,00:24:51.160,Okay.
00:24:51.280,00:24:53.960,"Oh, when you get it up there you have to lie it on its back."
00:24:54.080,00:24:55.480,Thank you.
00:25:38.040,00:25:40.400,Say something.
00:25:54.760,00:25:56.280,"Yeah, well."
00:25:56.400,00:25:59.080,Never was much of a looker was I?
00:26:01.360,00:26:03.160,It doesn't look like you.
00:26:09.400,00:26:11.360,Get the bath ready.
00:26:24.080,00:26:28.280,- Mar? Get the bath ready.
00:26:35.480,00:26:37.080,"Oh, God."
00:26:37.800,00:26:38.800,What is this?
00:26:38.920,00:26:40.960,Hang on.
00:26:41.080,00:26:42.640,It's nutrient gel.
00:26:42.760,00:26:46.760,Stops the synthetic muscle drying out in transit.
00:26:46.880,00:26:51.400,Smells almost...
00:26:51.520,00:26:54.520,"You can eat it if you like, it's non-toxic."
00:26:54.640,00:26:56.960,"I'll give that a miss, thanks."
00:26:57.080,00:26:59.440,Don't forget the electrolytes.
00:27:03.880,00:27:06.200,"Okay. Right, the whole lot?"
00:27:06.320,00:27:08.440,"Mm-hm, the whole lot."
00:27:11.840,00:27:14.200,It's like fish food.
00:27:14.320,00:27:17.040,He likes the taste of it.
00:27:19.360,00:27:20.640,Better leave him to it.
00:27:20.760,00:27:23.320,Yeah. Yeah.
00:27:26.240,00:27:28.200,I have to go in a minute.
00:27:28.320,00:27:29.600,"Oh, don't leave me here with it!"
00:27:31.520,00:27:33.240,"Look, you can hear."
00:27:33.360,00:27:36.480,the bathroom light on...
00:27:36.600,00:27:38.240,Don't what?
00:27:38.360,00:27:41.120,"Don't switch the bathroom light on, let it brew."
00:27:41.240,00:27:43.680,I've got to go.
00:29:18.440,00:29:21.120,You could've left me some clothes.
00:29:23.080,00:29:27.040,I mean talk about an undignified entrance.
00:29:34.960,00:29:38.040,"That's a bit creepy, what you're doing."
00:29:41.320,00:29:44.600,Is there at least a towel?
00:29:47.520,00:29:49.280,Hello?
00:29:53.400,00:29:55.160,I won't bite.
00:29:58.800,00:30:01.640,I'm alright here for now.
00:30:04.360,00:30:06.920,Would you like me to put some food on?
00:30:07.840,00:30:08.920,Do you eat?
00:30:09.040,00:30:12.080,"No. I mean, I don't need to."
00:30:12.200,00:30:14.040,"I can chew and swallow, if that makes it easier?"
00:30:14.160,00:30:17.400,Don't worry about it.
00:30:23.640,00:30:25.800,I need a drink.
00:30:41.920,00:30:43.240,Are you sure that's...
00:30:43.360,00:30:45.160,I know I'm not supposed to.
00:30:45.280,00:30:46.680,The official advice is to...
00:30:46.800,00:30:49.640,"Oh, fuck the official advice, it's one night."
00:30:51.040,00:30:53.000,You look well.
00:30:53.120,00:30:54.800,"Well, I am young."
00:30:54.920,00:30:59.760,"I mean, you look like him on a good day."
00:30:59.880,00:31:02.800,The photos we keep tend to be flattering.
00:31:21.360,00:31:23.800,You're so soft.
00:31:23.920,00:31:27.120,You're so smooth.
00:31:28.560,00:31:31.640,You've got pores and your lines...
00:31:33.040,00:31:35.600,It's texture mapping.
00:31:35.720,00:31:39.720,"The really tiny details are visual, 2-D."
00:31:39.840,00:31:43.480,"Here, try my fingertips."
00:31:47.960,00:31:49.520,See?
00:31:49.640,00:31:51.320,Weird.
00:31:52.440,00:31:53.640,Does it bother you?
00:31:53.760,00:31:55.360,No.
00:31:56.880,00:31:58.800,Yes.
00:32:00.440,00:32:02.320,I don't know.
00:32:04.480,00:32:06.360,I don't know.
00:32:11.320,00:32:15.760,I missed you.
00:32:15.880,00:32:17.560,"Hey, don't cry."
00:32:19.680,00:32:21.440,Don't cry.
00:32:36.440,00:32:38.480,"Come on then, top off."
00:32:52.760,00:32:54.080,What's wrong?
00:32:54.200,00:32:55.880,He had a mole there.
00:32:56.000,00:32:57.840,Where?
00:33:01.960,00:33:03.840,There.
00:33:03.960,00:33:05.440,Hang on.
00:33:09.040,00:33:11.560,That's ridiculous.
00:33:11.680,00:33:14.400,That's completely stupid.
00:33:27.680,00:33:28.560,Hello?
00:33:28.680,00:33:29.640,Hi.
00:33:29.760,00:33:31.480,Your hand's on my tit?
00:33:39.320,00:33:41.360,You're doing wonders for my self-esteem here.
00:33:41.480,00:33:44.560,There's no record of my sexual response.
00:33:44.680,00:33:46.560,I didn't discuss that side of things online.
00:33:46.680,00:33:49.960,"But you have sexual responses, I mean..."
00:33:51.600,00:33:53.120,This works?
00:33:53.240,00:33:58.400,"Oh, that I can turn that on and off pretty much instantly."
00:33:59.760,00:34:01.360,See?
00:34:07.600,00:34:10.240,I can do it again if you like.
00:34:19.120,00:34:23.240,"Oh, God. Oh, shit."
00:34:23.360,00:34:24.320,Should I stop?
00:34:24.440,00:34:26.760,"No. No, it's pretty good."
00:34:29.960,00:34:32.400,Where did you learn this?
00:34:32.520,00:34:35.920,Set routine based on pornographic videos.
00:34:58.280,00:34:59.960,I love you.
00:35:00.920,00:35:02.920,I love you.
00:35:20.560,00:35:23.080,- What is it?
00:35:23.200,00:35:24.520,Nothing.
00:35:24.640,00:35:26.520,"The way that your eyes were open, it scared me."
00:35:26.640,00:35:27.800,You'd prefer if I close them?
00:35:27.920,00:35:31.040,"What, when you're sleeping? Um, yeah?"
00:35:33.040,00:35:35.120,I don't really need to sleep.
00:35:36.560,00:35:39.080,"Well, just try next time."
00:35:51.560,00:35:53.080,Can I get you anything?
00:35:53.200,00:35:54.800,No.
00:35:54.920,00:35:56.520,"Coffee, sandwich?"
00:35:56.640,00:35:58.360,I said no.
00:35:59.080,00:36:02.080,"Ash, look sorry..."
00:36:04.480,00:36:06.240,It's just... a bit odd.
00:36:06.360,00:36:09.800,I can appreciate it's pretty strange.
00:36:09.920,00:36:12.280,"I just need a bit of, just getting used to it."
00:36:12.400,00:36:13.960,And I shouldn't have drunk last night.
00:36:14.080,00:36:15.880,Next time could you try and stop me.
00:36:16.000,00:36:17.120,Stop you drinking?
00:36:17.240,00:36:18.480,Yeah.
00:36:18.600,00:36:20.840,So I get to enjoy being a bit of a bastard?
00:36:24.480,00:36:26.080,What's wrong?
00:36:30.960,00:36:32.680,- What?
00:36:39.160,00:36:39.920,Hey!

00:36:47.800,00:36:49.280,"Yeah, yeah."
00:36:53.160,00:36:59.000,"Look at you, the town mouse has become the country mouse."
00:36:59.920,00:37:01.520,"Yeah, it's nice."
00:37:01.640,00:37:03.960,Was this all you?
00:37:06.800,00:37:08.280,Do you want a cup of coffee?
00:37:08.400,00:37:10.000,Yeah.
00:37:13.000,00:37:15.720,You weren't answering calls... or messages.
00:37:15.840,00:37:17.000,It's been really busy.
00:37:17.120,00:37:19.720,"I've just been a bit like, Oh, shit You know what's...?"
00:37:19.840,00:37:21.080,"Well, you know."
00:37:21.200,00:37:22.920,"Yeah, works been mad."
00:37:23.040,00:37:27.320,"Which is good, you know, obviously, because it's kept my mind off everything."
00:37:31.120,00:37:32.200,Where's the toilet?
00:37:32.320,00:37:35.200,- Upstairs.
00:37:42.960,00:37:46.720,"So, I mean, um..."

00:37:51.560,00:37:53.560,"Alright, come here."
00:37:56.000,00:37:58.000,I think it's great you're moving on.
00:37:59.040,00:38:00.240,What?
00:38:00.360,00:38:01.520,Sorry. There were...
00:38:01.640,00:38:03.520,"There were man clothes, you know."
00:38:03.640,00:38:04.880,In the bathroom?
00:38:05.000,00:38:06.840,Right.
00:38:08.120,00:38:10.080,Is he nice?

00:38:44.720,00:38:46.280,It's fine.
00:38:48.280,00:38:50.000,What did your friend say?
00:38:52.800,00:38:54.520,That was my sister.
00:38:54.640,00:38:56.800,You know her.
00:38:57.640,00:39:00.840,She said that I was...
00:39:00.960,00:39:04.960,She said that she was happy that I moved on.
00:39:05.080,00:39:06.560,Moved on to what?
00:39:09.080,00:39:11.400,Is that not the sort of thing I'd say?
00:39:16.760,00:39:18.720,Are you sure everything's alright...
00:39:18.840,00:39:19.720,Yes!
00:39:19.840,00:39:21.880,Shit.
00:39:25.040,00:39:27.960,"Its okay, I can do it."
00:39:28.080,00:39:29.760,I can do it.
00:39:29.880,00:39:31.960,Don't!
00:39:50.800,00:39:53.040,We need to wrap that in paper.
00:40:03.840,00:40:10.960,"Look, if you're going to pretend to be asleep, you could at least breathe, okay? It's just eerie."
00:40:13.280,00:40:14.840,Like this?
00:40:28.680,00:40:31.560,It doesn't work. I can tell that you're faking it.
00:40:33.040,00:40:36.120,Would you like me to have sex with you?
00:40:37.000,00:40:39.360,Can you just go downstairs?

00:41:14.400,00:41:16.200,Get out! Get out! Get out!
00:41:16.320,00:41:17.680,You're not enough of him.
00:41:17.800,00:41:21.960,"You are nothing, You're nothing!"

00:41:24.080,00:41:26.560,Fucking fight me!
00:41:26.680,00:41:29.440,Hit me!
00:41:29.560,00:41:31.720,Why are you just standing there taking this?
00:41:31.840,00:41:34.120,How can you take this?
00:41:34.240,00:41:35.320,Did I ever hit you?
00:41:35.440,00:41:38.840,"No, no, of course you didn't..."
00:41:38.960,00:41:40.640,but you might've done if I done this!
00:41:40.760,00:41:43.520,Or this...
00:41:43.640,00:41:45.960,"Maybe you would have, but you wouldn't, would you?"
00:41:46.080,00:41:48.000,You wouldn't.
00:41:48.120,00:41:49.960,I could insult you.
00:41:50.080,00:41:51.360,What?
00:41:51.480,00:41:53.200,There's tons of invective in the archive.
00:41:53.320,00:41:54.520,I liked speaking my mind.
00:41:54.640,00:41:55.880,I could throw some of that at you.
00:41:56.760,00:41:59.080,Get out of this house!
00:42:29.920,00:42:32.480,What are you doing?
00:42:32.600,00:42:36.240,I can't go more than 25 metres from my activation point.
00:42:36.360,00:42:37.840,"What is that, a joke?"
00:42:37.960,00:42:40.640,"Look, I know it sounds mental."
00:42:40.760,00:42:42.560,Where's your activation point?
00:42:42.680,00:42:47.040,"At the risk of blowing your mind, it was where I was activated."
00:42:47.160,00:42:48.600,The bath?
00:42:48.720,00:42:54.520,"I have to keep within a 25 metre radius unless my administrator, that's you, is with me."
00:42:54.640,00:42:56.160,Don't call me your administrator.
00:42:56.280,00:42:57.480,Why not?
00:42:58.200,00:42:59.160,Because ...
00:42:59.280,00:43:01.280,It sounds sort of sexy.
00:43:02.840,00:43:05.400,"If you're laughing, can I come back inside?"
00:43:05.520,00:43:10.680,Feeling a bit ornamental out here.
00:43:27.560,00:43:28.920,Funny.
00:43:30.520,00:43:31.960,"Can you put that down, please?"
00:43:32.080,00:43:33.160,But it is funny.
00:43:33.280,00:43:36.120,Could you just put it down?
00:43:42.560,00:43:45.040,"Come with me, we're going out."
00:43:58.040,00:43:59.560,Cheesy!
00:44:14.000,00:44:15.640,Come on.
00:44:15.760,00:44:16.680,Where are we going?
00:44:16.800,00:44:18.960,Just hurry up.
00:44:33.080,00:44:36.800,No! Don't do it!
00:44:41.240,00:44:43.320,"Seriously, don't do it."
00:44:43.440,00:44:45.320,I'm not going to.
00:44:45.440,00:44:46.960,Okay.
00:44:48.360,00:44:51.120,"See, he would have worked out what was going on."
00:44:52.520,00:44:56.080,"This wouldn't have ever happened but if it had, he would have worked it out."
00:44:56.200,00:44:59.000,"Sorry, hang on. That's a very difficult sentence to process."
00:45:00.360,00:45:01.800,Jump.
00:45:01.920,00:45:05.120,What? Over there?
00:45:05.240,00:45:08.080,I never expressed suicidal thoughts. Or self-harm.
00:45:08.200,00:45:10.560,"Yeah well, you aren't you, are you?"
00:45:10.680,00:45:13.440,"That's another difficult one, to be honest with you."
00:45:13.560,00:45:15.600,You're just a few ripples of you.
00:45:15.720,00:45:17.240,There's no history to you.
00:45:17.360,00:45:22.360,"You're just a performance of stuff that he performed without thinking, and it's not enough."
00:45:22.480,00:45:24.240,Come on.
00:45:24.360,00:45:26.480,Aim to jump. Just do it.
00:45:26.600,00:45:28.560,Okay.
00:45:28.680,00:45:30.800,If you're absolutely sure.
00:45:31.800,00:45:33.600,"See, Ash would've been scared."
00:45:33.720,00:45:37.160,"He wouldn't have just leap off, he would have been crying, he would have been..."
00:45:37.280,00:45:38.520,Oh.
00:45:41.080,00:45:46.000,"Oh, God, no. Please."
00:45:46.120,00:45:47.720,"Please, don't make me do it."
00:45:47.840,00:45:48.920,"No, that's not fair."
00:45:49.040,00:45:51.360,"No, I'm...."
00:45:49.040,00:45:53.720,"I'm frightened, darling, Please, I don't..."
00:45:53.840,00:45:56.520,I don't want to die.
00:45:56.640,00:45:58.120,"No, that's not fair."
00:45:58.240,00:45:59.320,"Please, I'm frightened."
00:45:59.440,00:46:01.680,No!
00:46:19.680,00:46:23.120,One for you.
00:46:23.880,00:46:24.640,What?
00:46:24.760,00:46:27.360,We need another slice.
00:46:27.480,00:46:28.440,Why?
00:46:28.560,00:46:31.120,So I can take one upstairs.
00:46:31.240,00:46:33.200,It's not the weekend.
00:46:33.320,00:46:34.800,It is my birthday.
00:46:36.480,00:46:38.240,Okay.
00:46:45.160,00:46:46.880,"Thanks, Mum."
00:46:52.280,00:46:53.520,"Hey, Ash."
00:46:53.640,00:46:54.880,Hey.
00:46:55.000,00:46:56.840,The birthday girl.
00:46:56.960,00:46:58.600,Just gonna come and hang out for a bit.
00:46:58.720,00:47:01.520,Okay.
00:47:01.640,00:47:04.520,I brought you some cake.
00:47:04.640,00:47:08.920,I'm just using you as an excuse so I can get an extra slice.
00:47:11.480,00:47:13.560,Mum!
00:47:15.120,00:47:17.080,Yeah. I'm just coming.
00:00:37.400,00:00:39.600,They're ready for you now.
00:00:42.360,00:00:44.200,Gwendolyn Harris. We've met.
00:00:44.320,00:00:45.240,Bournemouth.
00:00:45.360,00:00:46.320,But you don't know the others.
00:00:46.440,00:00:48.880,"No, but I'm familiar with you."
00:00:49.000,00:00:51.480,Why do you want to be an MP?
00:00:51.600,00:00:53.520,Because I'm not satisfied with the way things are.
00:00:53.640,00:00:58.280,"And rather than sit back and moan, I'd prefer to do something about it."
00:00:59.960,00:01:04.640,Ok. I don't know why anyone's surprised the world's number one teen idol's become a Scientologist.
00:01:04.760,00:01:06.000,Speed up the autocue please.
00:01:06.120,00:01:08.760,Popstars do believe in weird things.
00:01:08.880,00:01:11.840,Abba believed in angels.
00:01:11.960,00:01:13.720,They said show you this.
00:01:13.840,00:01:14.920,- This happen just now?
00:01:15.040,00:01:16.440,Gladwell?
00:01:16.560,00:01:21.440,Shamed Tory Jason Gladwell resigns capitals - over Twitter porn pic scandal.
00:01:21.560,00:01:22.960,"Oh, so he wasn't hacked after all."
00:01:23.080,00:01:25.200,Originally claimed his account had been hacked.
00:01:25.320,00:01:29.680,Resignation statement admits 'inappropriate correspondence' with a 15-year-old girl.
00:01:29.800,00:01:32.120,What's he tweeting dick photos as correspondence now is it?
00:01:32.240,00:01:36.160,Departure triggers a by-election in his Stentonford and Hersham constituency.
00:01:36.280,00:01:38.040,Well you get to use the Gladwell stuff.
00:01:38.160,00:01:39.360,Mm-hm.
00:01:39.480,00:01:40.800,Bump it all to the top of the monologue.
00:01:40.920,00:01:43.120,Anyone seen Jamie?
00:01:49.960,00:01:51.640,be calling me any more.
00:01:51.760,00:01:53.960,You need to sort yourself out.
00:01:54.080,00:01:55.480,I am.
00:01:55.600,00:01:58.720,Focus on Waldo.
00:01:58.840,00:01:59.560,But it's not...
00:01:59.680,00:02:01.120,"He's a hit, Jamie."
00:02:01.240,00:02:04.160,"He, not me, he."
00:02:04.280,00:02:05.840,"Oh, just do your show."
00:02:05.960,00:02:07.480,I will...
00:02:07.600,00:02:08.840,"- I mean, hon, if you'd just..."
00:02:11.200,00:02:14.360,"Jamie, hurry up."
00:02:14.480,00:02:16.160,Stentonford and Hersham?
00:02:16.280,00:02:21.440,"Safe Tory seat, so realistically I know there's not much of a chance but..."
00:02:21.560,00:02:24.120,So it's a stepping stone for you?
00:02:24.240,00:02:27.640,Yes.
00:02:27.760,00:02:30.160,Obviously I wouldn't say that outside of this room but...
00:02:30.280,00:02:34.080,"You want me to be honest, there's no point in pretending."
00:02:34.200,00:02:38.480,Is there anything in your past that might conceivably cause problems?
00:02:38.600,00:02:40.560,No.
00:02:41.160,00:02:43.960,Except...
00:02:44.080,00:02:51.880,"I did commit a series of murders in Huddersfield between '99 and 2003 but that, apart from that..."
00:02:53.880,00:02:56.600,"Well. Thank you, Gwendolyn."
00:02:56.720,00:02:58.120,If you could leave via that door.
00:02:58.240,00:02:59.560,Oh. That door?
00:02:59.680,00:03:02.680,We like to keep the candidates separate.
00:03:02.800,00:03:05.240,Right. Yes.
00:03:16.360,00:03:20.760,"Idiot, idiot."
00:03:20.880,00:03:34.960,"and all round pillock of the community Jason Gladwell has resigned as an MP, saying he could no longer maintain his position: that position presumably being hunched over, wanking madly at schoolkids."
00:03:36.840,00:03:39.160,- You ready?
00:03:39.280,00:03:41.000,...how old the girl wasn't.
00:03:41.120,00:03:45.960,That's the sort of feeble excuse only a naive schoolkid could swallow.
00:03:46.080,00:03:47.720,Which presumably was the idea.
00:03:47.840,00:03:51.400,Anyway the bad news is he's resigned in disgrace.
00:03:51.520,00:03:57.640,The good news is he's now free to pursue a full-time career in the disgraced paedophile industry.
00:04:02.080,00:04:03.800,"Um, small change to the intro."
00:04:03.920,00:04:05.320,- What?
00:04:05.440,00:04:06.840,Conor wanted the Jacko gag for the monologue...
00:04:06.960,00:04:08.360,That was my bit.
00:04:08.480,00:04:09.880,"There's the Chancellor stuff, you could use that."
00:04:11.640,00:04:12.640,I do piss taking.
00:04:12.760,00:04:14.160,Go be Waldo.
00:04:14.280,00:04:15.440,"Yes, commander."
00:04:15.560,00:04:17.880,believed he could fly.
00:04:18.000,00:04:20.560,And Michael Jackson believed that his doctor was qualified.
00:04:20.680,00:04:22.440,Big. Bold. Blue. Bear. Bollocks.
00:04:22.560,00:04:33.000,"And now it's time for our final visit to the world of educational children's programming courtesy of everyone's favourite and only occasionally inappropriate cool kids TV character, Waldo."
00:04:36.160,00:04:38.800,"Whose mum's in tonight, apparently."
00:04:38.920,00:04:41.360,"Waldo, who have you had in your cave this week?"
00:04:41.480,00:04:44.720,"Well, Conor."
00:04:47.880,00:04:49.560,He's quite handsome isn't he?
00:04:49.680,00:04:51.880,I was hoping he'd nosh me off.
00:04:52.000,00:04:53.680,Wanna see how it panned out?
00:04:53.800,00:04:55.440,I think we should.
00:04:55.560,00:04:57.720,Run VT!
00:05:09.440,00:05:14.720,"Hey, everybody."
00:05:14.840,00:05:20.400,Cool! Cool! Waldoriffic!
00:05:20.520,00:05:24.000,"Hey, kids. My guest this week is Mister Monroe."
00:05:24.120,00:05:25.840,"Hello, Mister Monroe."
00:05:25.960,00:05:27.440,"Hello, Waldo."
00:05:27.560,00:05:30.440,Mister Monroe is a politician.
00:05:34.440,00:05:37.160,"So what is a politician, Mr Monroe?"
00:05:37.280,00:05:41.400,Well a politician is someone who tries to make the world a fairer place.
00:05:41.520,00:05:42.760,Like Batman?
00:05:42.880,00:05:45.280,Not exactly like Batman.
00:05:45.400,00:05:46.640,Do you beat people up?
00:05:46.760,00:05:48.160,"No, I don't beat people up."
00:05:51.920,00:05:53.800,"Well, I'm not sure I know exactly what you..."
00:05:53.920,00:05:55.720,You don't know what pussy is?
00:05:59.080,00:06:01.280,"Okay, clearly this is some kind of joke."
00:06:01.400,00:06:05.760,"No joke, sorry, let's move on."
00:06:14.920,00:06:16.800,"Hello, mate. Great show."
00:06:16.920,00:06:18.560,Good. Yeah.
00:06:18.680,00:06:20.160,"So uhm, we'll bring him over."
00:06:20.280,00:06:21.880,"You go and get him, I'll explain about..."
00:06:23.560,00:06:24.520,Jamie.
00:06:24.640,00:06:26.440,"What you want, Miss Tamsin?"
00:06:26.560,00:06:29.000,"Behind me, man in glasses, talking to Jack Napier."
00:06:29.120,00:06:30.160,Jack freaks me out.
00:06:30.280,00:06:34.960,"Yeah, ditto, but he owns the company, and the man he's with is important and wants to talk to you."
00:06:35.080,00:06:37.000,He's from the channel.
00:06:37.120,00:06:38.520,Go on.
00:06:38.640,00:06:44.760,"all I'm saying is - is he's a terrific guy - Jim, Jamie."
00:06:44.880,00:06:45.640,How do you do?
00:06:45.760,00:06:48.320,"Jim, Jack James - Jamie."
00:06:50.240,00:06:53.400,Yeah. Liam Monroe has lodged a complaint.
00:06:53.520,00:06:55.520,Toys out of the pram.
00:06:55.640,00:06:56.760,And that's...
00:06:56.880,00:06:58.360,Good press.
00:06:58.480,00:07:03.160,"So tough to get a breakthrough these days, but when it does, well, it's just fantastic."
00:07:13.640,00:07:15.440,"Well, Twitter can't get enough of Waldo."
00:07:15.560,00:07:17.440,Loves him.
00:07:17.560,00:07:23.600,"Look, I know this show is coming back again next year but we want to see more of Waldo."
00:07:25.680,00:07:27.040,They want to do a pilot.
00:07:27.160,00:07:28.160,A Waldo pilot?
00:07:28.280,00:07:29.720,Yeah. I mean how does that sound?
00:07:29.840,00:07:32.200,"Yeah, that sounds good."
00:07:32.320,00:07:35.640,"Sounds Storming Norman, Fucking Storming."
00:07:35.760,00:07:37.480,Gonna give it to 'em!
00:08:03.560,00:08:05.520,Realistically there isn't the budget for other animations.
00:08:05.640,00:08:07.760,"I mean live action, other characters I can do."
00:08:07.880,00:08:09.000,What about The Brown Knight?
00:08:09.120,00:08:11.800,"What, the Crap Crusader?"
00:08:11.920,00:08:13.520,into the Brown Knight.
00:08:13.640,00:08:16.360,"But right now, let's, let's find more Waldo ideas."
00:08:18.320,00:08:20.880,guests we book will be in on it.
00:08:21.000,00:08:23.240,"They know that Waldo's a joke, the surprise has gone."
00:08:23.360,00:08:24.600,"Yeah, So we think round that."
00:08:24.720,00:08:28.200,"Hey, boys and girls, it's Waldo Time!"
00:08:28.320,00:08:31.240,Yeahhhhh!
00:08:31.360,00:08:32.960,"He's awesome, isn't he?"
00:08:33.080,00:08:34.480,"I mean, look."
00:08:34.600,00:08:37.120,"Sod name in lights, you're an app now my brother."
00:08:38.920,00:08:41.840,"Alright, Sara. How's the think tanking going? Good shit?"
00:08:41.960,00:08:44.040,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:44.160,00:08:47.840,Good. I see our friend Monroe is in the news again.
00:08:47.960,00:08:50.560,Running in the Stentonford by-election.
00:08:50.680,00:08:52.800,We should get Waldo down there.
00:08:52.920,00:08:54.840,"Hey. That's not a bad idea, actually."
00:08:54.960,00:08:56.480,We get a van...
00:08:56.600,00:08:59.280,"right, with a screen with the image of Waldo on the side."
00:08:59.400,00:09:00.720,Like it.
00:09:00.840,00:09:04.080,"And then when Monroe's doing a meet-and-greet, we just turn up and just get under his skin."
00:09:04.200,00:09:05.920,I love that.
00:09:06.040,00:09:07.920,- I've done Monroe.
00:09:08.040,00:09:09.920,I'm dumb or clever enough to be political. I just...
00:09:10.040,00:09:13.400,Why don't we get Waldo to stand for the by-election?
00:09:13.520,00:09:14.600,Get people to vote for him?
00:09:14.720,00:09:16.240,He's not real.
00:09:16.360,00:09:18.160,But people have stood as fictional characters before?
00:09:18.280,00:09:20.560,Do you think Screaming Lord Sutch was his real name?
00:09:20.680,00:09:22.840,We just put commonly known as on the ballot.
00:09:22.960,00:09:24.800,"No one's actually going to vote for him, that's not the point."
00:09:24.920,00:09:26.440,The point is we get to hang around.
00:09:26.560,00:09:28.040,We're there for the count.
00:09:28.160,00:09:31.640,"Well, go on then, Sara."
00:09:46.960,00:09:49.800,a mum and baby group.
00:09:49.920,00:09:54.400,"Okay. Going live in five, four, three, two."
00:09:54.520,00:09:56.160,joining me this morning.
00:09:56.280,00:10:00.720,It's been incredibly informative and I think we should have a little round of applause for the children.
00:10:00.840,00:10:04.280,Who were fantastic.
00:10:05.360,00:10:07.360,Thank you for your time.
00:10:10.240,00:10:13.720,"Hey! Hey, it's me Waldo."
00:10:13.840,00:10:16.480,"Oh, I like your trainers, man."
00:10:16.600,00:10:20.000,I'd wear trainers myself but I can't 'cause I haven't got feet. I've got stumps.
00:10:21.680,00:10:22.960,He's out.
00:10:23.080,00:10:25.040,"Hey, Mister Monroe!"
00:10:25.160,00:10:27.200,Did you get off with any of the mums?
00:10:27.320,00:10:28.680,Where'd you look while they were breastfeeding?
00:10:28.800,00:10:30.560,"They got big milky tits, Mr Monroe."
00:10:30.680,00:10:35.400,"He said it! Mister Monroe, don't walk away from me."
00:10:35.520,00:10:37.000,"I'm sorry about this, Liam."
00:10:37.120,00:10:38.880,"Hey, I'm being snubbed."
00:10:39.000,00:10:40.440,Don't just get in your car.
00:10:40.560,00:10:42.560,"It's a death trap anyway, look at it."
00:10:42.680,00:10:44.680,Let's find out what we can about the idiot inside that thing.
00:10:51.400,00:10:52.880,Stentonford labour party.
00:10:53.000,00:11:00.080,"Right, you've got a choice of styles, so just choose one from there, then you put your name in there."
00:11:01.480,00:11:03.200,This is like bloody Moonpig.
00:11:03.320,00:11:05.920,the free mail-out.
00:11:10.920,00:11:12.680,He doesn't have to.
00:11:17.760,00:11:20.560,Day one of the campaign in Stentonford and Hersham.
00:11:20.680,00:11:23.680,And Tory hopeful Liam Monroe hits the ground running.
00:11:23.800,00:11:27.320,The licence fee is something that's very close to my heart and I suspect...
00:11:27.440,00:11:29.640,Look at me Mister Monroe!
00:11:29.760,00:11:32.880,"Hey, over here! Hey, over here."
00:11:33.000,00:11:39.320,party have been er-- have been arguing for a reduction of the licence fee for...
00:11:39.440,00:11:42.680,"Good morning, everybody. Why you ignoring me, Mister Monroe?"
00:11:42.800,00:11:45.760,Why you ignoring me?
00:11:45.880,00:11:48.680,Mister Monroe?
00:11:48.800,00:11:50.760,"Mum with a pushchair, drag her into it."
00:11:50.880,00:11:53.560,"Hey, you. Mum with the pushchair. Yeah, you."
00:11:53.680,00:11:56.560,Ask Mr Monroe why he's ignoring me.
00:11:56.680,00:11:58.480,Why are you ignoring Waldo?
00:11:58.600,00:12:02.320,"Mr. Monroe, what's Waldo done to you?"
00:12:02.440,00:12:05.920,We should probably just shift before this turns stupid.
00:12:06.040,00:12:09.120,I'm not walking away from a cartoon.
00:12:10.640,00:12:12.200,I'm not ignoring you.
00:12:12.320,00:12:16.720,"Yeah, you were, you upset me. You made Waldo sad."
00:12:16.840,00:12:19.320,Wah.
00:12:21.560,00:12:25.680,"Well, obviously I'm absolutely devastated that you're upset!"
00:12:25.800,00:12:27.920,Wah!
00:12:33.880,00:12:37.000,I'm not ignoring you because there is no you.
00:12:37.120,00:12:42.240,"You are an image voiced by a comedian, an alleged comedian more accurately."
00:12:42.360,00:12:44.640,"If I'm not real, why you talking to him?"
00:12:44.760,00:12:46.360,And by him I mean me.
00:12:46.480,00:12:49.160,Right.
00:12:49.280,00:12:51.840,There's no point in attempting to converse with a cartoon.
00:12:51.960,00:12:57.600,"Oooh, converse, your lordship; thy flowery language doth give me a right throbbing bone-on."
00:13:08.400,00:13:10.400,Finished.
00:13:17.000,00:13:18.960,Drink?
00:13:19.080,00:13:20.720,I've got emails.
00:13:26.720,00:13:29.880,You know that's Gwendolyn Harris?
00:13:30.000,00:13:31.880,The Labour candidate.
00:13:33.040,00:13:34.760,Did you read my background doc?
00:13:34.880,00:13:36.520,Yes.
00:13:37.680,00:13:40.480,Why don't you read it tonight?
00:13:49.600,00:13:52.920,"I'll swing by about nine, so have your breakfast first."
00:13:53.040,00:13:55.040,Are you my dad?
00:13:55.160,00:13:57.080,Apparently not.
00:13:57.200,00:13:58.720,See you tomorrow.
00:13:58.840,00:14:00.640,Stentonford by-election.
00:14:00.760,00:14:02.640,Waldo the bear left Monroe in stunned silence.
00:14:02.760,00:14:08.720,The colourful Waldo launched his own campaign in typically loud and crowd-pleasing style.
00:14:12.000,00:14:13.840,Someone's bold?
00:14:13.960,00:14:16.240,Nice way to greet a voter.
00:14:16.360,00:14:18.160,"Sorry, I thought..."
00:14:18.280,00:14:20.800,"Actually, I'm more of a rival."
00:14:20.920,00:14:23.280,"Hey Mister Monroe, Mister Monroe."
00:14:23.400,00:14:24.800,"Why are you ignoring me, Mister Monroe."
00:14:24.920,00:14:25.800,You're good at that.
00:14:25.920,00:14:26.880,Because I am that.
00:14:27.000,00:14:28.080,What? You're that thing?
00:14:28.200,00:14:31.360,Waldo's not a thing.
00:14:31.480,00:14:34.040,Liam Monroe calls him worse.
00:14:34.160,00:14:35.760,"Nice work there, by the way."
00:14:35.880,00:14:39.280,"Yeah, well. It's dick jokes at his expense basically."
00:14:39.400,00:14:40.240,Another one?
00:14:40.360,00:14:42.560,Okay. One.
00:14:46.120,00:14:49.240,"The way you describe it, it's like you're doing this for a showreel."
00:14:49.360,00:14:51.240,"No, but..."
00:14:51.360,00:14:52.960,Like this place is the equivalent of a walk-on in a sketch show.
00:14:53.080,00:14:54.800,Shhh!
00:14:54.920,00:14:57.880,But your party leader has to show up because it's a mid-thing- Midterm by-election.
00:14:58.000,00:14:59.160,Terminology tits.
00:14:59.280,00:15:00.720,You are twelve.
00:15:00.840,00:15:06.200,"So because leaderballs is there, suddenly it's walk-on in a Ricky Gervais sketch show so it's good exposure."
00:15:06.320,00:15:08.000,"You're not gonna win, you know you're not gonna win."
00:15:08.120,00:15:09.160,"Come on, shhh."
00:15:09.280,00:15:11.000,You're not gonna win though.
00:15:11.120,00:15:12.560,Of course not.
00:15:12.680,00:15:15.040,So why not be honest?
00:15:12.680,00:15:16.760,"Say You arseholes aren't going to vote for me, so here's what I think anyway."
00:15:16.880,00:15:18.320,It doesn't work like that.
00:15:20.200,00:15:23.080,You're angry for someone who's doing well.
00:15:23.200,00:15:27.240,I'm the voice of a blue bear.
00:15:27.360,00:15:30.160,"If that's doing well, then we are doomed."
00:15:34.280,00:15:35.560,I can't see.
00:15:40.240,00:15:43.920,Have you had a fox in here or do you live like a 14-year-old?
00:15:48.480,00:15:50.280,"Don't get too excited, I'm not sleeping in it."
00:15:50.400,00:15:51.920,"Shit, really?"
00:16:08.920,00:16:10.040,You're amazing.
00:16:10.160,00:16:11.200,Sorry?
00:16:11.320,00:16:12.560,You're amazing?
00:16:12.680,00:16:14.200,Ha! Thank you.
00:16:37.880,00:16:39.280,What's up?
00:16:39.400,00:16:40.840,Nothing.
00:16:40.960,00:16:42.880,Are you sure?
00:16:47.120,00:16:49.320,It's just...
00:16:52.880,00:17:00.520,"I haven't been happy in a while and this is good, you know."
00:17:00.640,00:17:02.320,Mm.
00:17:11.680,00:17:14.600,Can I have your number?
00:17:18.520,00:17:20.160,Yes.
00:17:37.120,00:17:38.840,Where's our mark this morning?
00:17:38.960,00:17:39.920,We're out on the road.
00:17:40.040,00:17:42.360,Ooh. Bien sur.
00:17:47.520,00:17:50.400,Hello. I'm Mister Monroe.
00:17:50.520,00:17:53.960,Vote for me and keep things shitty.
00:18:17.560,00:18:20.360,Vote Waldo. Vote Waldo.
00:18:20.480,00:18:24.320,Vote Waldo. Vote Waldo.
00:18:26.520,00:18:28.880,You're right. Strong Tory.
00:18:29.000,00:18:30.640,I warned you.
00:18:30.760,00:18:33.160,You know you're on Monroe turf when they live so far apart.
00:18:40.400,00:18:42.840,I met Waldo last night.
00:18:42.960,00:18:45.600,"Jamie, the guy who plays him."
00:18:45.720,00:18:46.840,Fun?
00:18:46.960,00:18:50.080,Mmm-hmm.
00:18:50.200,00:18:52.880,Did you tell him anything about our campaign?
00:18:53.000,00:18:54.040,Not really.
00:18:54.160,00:18:57.720,Not really or no?
00:18:57.840,00:18:59.840,Not really.
00:18:59.960,00:19:01.160,"Look, he's okay."
00:19:01.280,00:19:02.600,He's a comedian.
00:19:02.720,00:19:05.520,"He's mocking Monroe now, it'll be you next."
00:19:06.880,00:19:10.280,His act is all f-this and penis jokes.
00:19:10.400,00:19:13.120,- But...
00:19:19.520,00:19:23.960,Okay. Job done till the husting tomorrow.
00:19:24.080,00:19:28.760,Some media students doing a Question Time type thing; they've asked Waldo to join the panel.
00:19:28.880,00:19:31.880,"Oh, come on. It's my nightmare, going on Question Time."
00:19:32.000,00:19:33.120,"It's students, you'll walk it."
00:19:33.240,00:19:34.640,I can't answer serious questions!
00:19:34.760,00:19:36.000,No one wants you to!
00:19:36.120,00:19:39.240,"You're the comic relief, lighten up."
00:19:50.240,00:19:53.480,Just have a look. I'm sure you'll find lots in there.
00:19:56.560,00:20:00.120,you're concerned about at all?
00:20:16.560,00:20:18.000,Hey.
00:20:18.120,00:20:19.080,"Oh, hi."
00:20:19.200,00:20:20.240,I thought we were going to...
00:20:20.360,00:20:21.360,Sorry I've had a tough day.
00:20:21.480,00:20:22.760,Right. Not even one?
00:20:22.880,00:20:24.280,Sorry.
00:20:24.400,00:20:26.920,"Well, what about tomorrow?"
00:20:27.040,00:20:28.960,"Look, I can't. When this is happening, I can't see you."
00:20:29.080,00:20:31.920,- What do you mean?
00:20:42.960,00:20:45.360,Do they think that looks like Question Time?
00:20:45.480,00:20:48.640,Yeah.
00:20:50.080,00:20:53.120,Check the host.
00:21:00.000,00:21:05.560,"When it comes to addiction and addicts we should sympathise, but we shouldn't patronise."
00:21:05.680,00:21:13.920,"You know serious drug use is a criminal offence, that is committed voluntarily and for pleasure."
00:21:14.040,00:21:15.680,"Look, I'm sorry, these are the facts."
00:21:15.800,00:21:17.240,"Waldo, what do you think?"
00:21:17.360,00:21:19.280,"Mister Monroe, are you addicted?"
00:21:19.400,00:21:20.480,No.
00:21:25.280,00:21:26.560,I think we have to ask ourselves...
00:21:26.680,00:21:31.360,I think we have to ask ourselves What is this for?
00:21:28.480,00:21:36.520,And Why do we waste our time with animated trivialities like him? I mean why?
00:21:36.640,00:21:38.360,Why?
00:21:38.480,00:21:41.000,I mean why? I mean why? I mean why? I mean why? I mean why?
00:21:41.120,00:21:43.680,"This is just the kind of thing, rather than see you laugh..."
00:21:43.800,00:21:45.680,"They laugh at you, Limbo."
00:21:45.800,00:21:48.840,"You laugh, you're laughing at someone who won't engage."
00:21:48.960,00:21:53.160,"Who is scared to engage, who hides behind a children's cartoon."
00:21:53.280,00:21:55.840,"Who you calling a kiddy toon, fool?"
00:21:55.960,00:22:00.760,"I'm, I'm, I'm speaking about James Salter."
00:22:02.440,00:22:05.520,"- That's your name, isn't it?"
00:22:05.640,00:22:10.560,"James Salter, this is the man who's behind all this."
00:22:10.680,00:22:30.920,"He's 33 years old, a man whose career can be summed up surprisingly quickly: you were in a sketch troupe that enjoyed minor success about six years ago and the, the others moved on to better things, but your main achievement seems to have been playing the, the part of a corn-on-the-cob in a high interest personal loan commercial."
00:22:31.040,00:22:33.160,"I notice you're, you keep that pretty quiet."
00:22:33.280,00:22:37.360,"And now of course operating this, this sort of teddy bear thing."
00:22:37.480,00:22:39.280,Which by the way is easier than it looks.
00:22:39.400,00:22:42.440,Anyone could do it.
00:22:43.320,00:22:46.280,"It's easy, what he does."
00:22:46.400,00:22:47.960,He mocks.
00:22:48.080,00:22:53.760,"And when he can't think of an authentic joke, which is actually quite often, he just swears."
00:22:53.880,00:23:02.760,"I think that this puppet's inclusion on this panel debases the process of debate, and smothers any meaningful discussion of the issues."
00:23:02.880,00:23:07.320,"So I return to my original question, is that really what this is for?"
00:23:07.440,00:23:10.840,He has nothing to offer and he has nothing to say.
00:23:10.960,00:23:15.400,Prove me wrong.
00:23:15.520,00:23:17.200,Please.
00:23:18.480,00:23:20.600,Come on. Speak up.
00:23:22.560,00:23:24.960,"There you see, nothing."
00:23:25.080,00:23:26.400,"Aw, go fuck yourself."
00:23:28.280,00:23:29.920,There. More swearing.
00:23:30.040,00:23:32.640,You're a joke.
00:23:37.800,00:23:41.560,What are you? You're just an old attitude with new hair.
00:23:41.680,00:23:44.640,Assuming you're my superior because I'm not taking you seriously?
00:23:44.760,00:23:47.040,"No one takes you seriously, that's why no one votes."
00:23:47.160,00:23:49.840,- The vast majority do vote.
00:23:49.960,00:23:50.880,Surely this is enough?
00:23:51.000,00:23:52.120,You think you deserve respect?
00:23:52.240,00:23:53.600,"Well, just common courtesy."
00:23:53.720,00:23:56.720,Because you went to public school and grew up believing you're entitled to everything?
00:23:56.840,00:23:59.080,Ad hominem nonsense.
00:23:59.200,00:24:00.760,Gwendolyn Harris we...
00:24:00.880,00:24:02.160,Something's got to change.
00:24:02.280,00:24:06.040,No one trusts you lot 'cause they know you don't give a shit about anything outside your bubble.
00:24:06.160,00:24:11.800,"What about your mate Gladwell, the kiddy-flasher, you knew him for 20 years, did you not know what he was like?"
00:24:11.920,00:24:13.320,"No, of course not."
00:24:13.440,00:24:18.960,"Yeah, 'cause you're all just front, like him, sly and pretending, and in that way you're all the same."
00:24:23.560,00:24:26.360,"Well, of course I think no."
00:24:26.480,00:24:29.520,"Oh, shut up."
00:24:29.640,00:24:31.760,"Seriously, she's faker than him."
00:24:31.880,00:24:37.880,"For once I find myself agreeing with Liam Monroe in that this really doesn't get us anywhere, and there's not much point in us continuing to..."
00:24:38.000,00:24:39.960,Why are you here?
00:24:40.080,00:24:42.920,Tell them why you're here.
00:24:45.520,00:24:48.280,She's here to build a showreel.
00:24:45.520,00:24:51.120,"I'm not kidding, that's literally it."
00:24:48.400,00:24:53.680,"Knows she's not going to win, this is all experience, to get herself on telly."
00:24:53.800,00:24:58.880,She actually gives less of a shit about anyone round here than he does because he'll actually have to represent you.
00:24:59.000,00:25:00.480,Am I wrong?
00:25:00.600,00:25:05.800,"A career politician, someone else less real than me, and I can do this."
00:25:08.680,00:25:10.480,Can I just make a couple of points...
00:25:10.600,00:25:13.440,"Oh, shut up, you pebble."
00:25:13.560,00:25:16.120,What is this for?
00:25:16.240,00:25:19.080,"And the truth is, none of us know any more thanks to you."
00:25:19.200,00:25:21.920,What are you for?
00:25:22.040,00:25:24.600,Thank you and goodnight.
00:26:18.480,00:26:20.960,Jamie?
00:26:21.080,00:26:23.720,Jack says he wants to see us.
00:26:24.880,00:26:27.320,You can't avoid it.
00:26:31.440,00:26:34.320,Get dressed.
00:26:49.960,00:26:57.120,"of vapidity aside, it's clearly tapped a nerve: in just three days, Waldo has gone viral."
00:26:57.240,00:27:02.280,The video of his clash has already been viewed over a million times on YouTube.
00:27:02.400,00:27:07.200,There are Facebook groups calling on Waldo to form a national party.
00:27:07.320,00:27:16.040,You look less human than I do and I'm a made-up bear with a turquoise-- What are you? You're just an old attitude with new hair.
00:27:16.160,00:27:20.720,Assuming you're my superior because I'm not taking you seriously?
00:27:30.240,00:27:33.280,"Oh, look here he is, the man of the moment!"
00:27:33.400,00:27:35.040,How does it feel to be a phenomenon?
00:27:36.840,00:27:38.520,"You are everywhere, my son."
00:27:38.640,00:27:40.960,"Twitter, the news, have you seen the poll?"
00:27:41.080,00:27:44.960,"You're in third place, mate."
00:27:45.080,00:27:46.560,"Yeah, well, he's a glass of water."
00:27:46.680,00:27:47.760,"This is an opportunity, Jamie."
00:27:47.880,00:27:49.240,He knows my name now.
00:27:49.360,00:27:51.240,do something here.
00:27:51.360,00:27:55.440,"You know everyone's pissed with the status quo, and Waldo gives that a voice."
00:27:55.560,00:27:58.560,"Waldo's a bear, a blue bear."
00:27:58.680,00:27:59.800,"Tell him, Tams."
00:27:59.920,00:28:02.520,We've been asked on Consensus.
00:28:02.640,00:28:06.640,It's a ten minute one-to-one interview - with Phillip Crane.
00:28:06.760,00:28:07.840,Big guns for big guns.
00:28:07.960,00:28:09.880,"Hello? I'm not a politician, okay?"
00:28:10.000,00:28:11.240,I don't want to be a politician.
00:28:11.360,00:28:13.200,you hate politics.
00:28:13.320,00:28:14.800,"I don't hate them, I'm just not interested in them."
00:28:14.920,00:28:16.440,You don't need to be interested in them.
00:28:16.560,00:28:19.160,You just need to be Waldo.
00:28:19.280,00:28:22.760,And when Crane asks something tricky and I look stupid because I don't know how to answer?
00:28:22.880,00:28:26.600,You'll know the answer.
00:28:26.720,00:28:29.960,"Look, I can tell you what to say."
00:28:30.080,00:28:34.040,"I can live-google any facts, give you stats, quotes, whatever else you need."
00:28:34.160,00:28:38.720,So you've got a safety net for the concrete stuff and the rest is Waldo and you can do that in your sleep.
00:28:38.840,00:28:40.640,You'll piss all over Crane.
00:28:40.760,00:28:42.720,"He'll know there's a team around me, he'll see it."
00:28:42.840,00:28:45.160,"Yeah, good. I hope he does."
00:28:45.280,00:28:51.560,"All the other MPs have got teams, we're just more honest about it. Now come on. What d'you say? Ey?"
00:28:54.880,00:28:56.000,Jamie. Jamie!
00:28:56.120,00:28:57.960,Why would I want to do this?
00:28:58.080,00:29:00.400,Look the world is knackered and you can do something about it.
00:29:00.520,00:29:02.000,I don't know what you're on about.
00:29:02.120,00:29:07.520,"Waldo has got the attention of the young, and the young don't give a shit about anything except trainers and pirating films."
00:29:07.640,00:29:10.360,Do you have any other astounding theories about young people?
00:29:10.480,00:29:14.040,"Yeah, yeah, I do actually."
00:29:10.480,00:29:17.640,"Look, they care about Waldo, they'll vote for Waldo. The video was a hit for a reason..."
00:29:19.920,00:29:21.440,I was lashing out.
00:29:19.920,00:29:23.800,I wasn't even articulate - It doesn't matter- Or funny which is almost worse.
00:29:23.920,00:29:24.800,We can build on that.
00:29:24.920,00:29:26.520,Waldo's not real.
00:29:26.640,00:29:31.120,"Exactly! That's what you said that really hit home, he's not real, but he's realer than all the others."
00:29:31.240,00:29:32.880,He doesn't stand for anything.
00:29:33.000,00:29:40.120,"Yeah well at least he doesn't pretend to. Look we, we don't need politicians, we've all got iPhones and computers right?"
00:29:40.240,00:29:48.800,"So any decision that has to be made, any policy we just put it online. Let the people vote thumbs up, thumbs down, the majority wins. That's a democracy."
00:29:50.800,00:29:58.200,So's YouTube and I don't know if you've seen it but the most popular video is a dog farting the theme tune to Happy Days.
00:30:00.000,00:30:01.960,"Well, today it's Waldo."
00:30:02.080,00:30:04.680,No. It's still the dog.
00:30:04.800,00:30:09.080,"Listen, can you imagine all the things we can change if we fucked the politicians out the equation."
00:30:09.200,00:30:12.200,I've said what I've said and now I'm shutting this door.
00:30:15.720,00:30:20.880,Do you know who owns Waldo?
00:30:23.160,00:30:24.320,He's my character.
00:30:24.440,00:30:27.160,"Yeah, written for my show."
00:30:27.280,00:30:29.080,You're too frightened to take to the next level.
00:30:29.200,00:30:33.320,Fine. I understand.
00:30:33.960,00:30:36.680,And watch me fly.
00:30:36.800,00:30:40.360,"You own Waldo, you can't be Waldo."
00:30:40.480,00:30:44.280,Jamie. What's happening?
00:30:45.400,00:30:48.040,Pretty close I'd say.
00:30:52.720,00:30:58.600,What's happening?
00:30:58.720,00:31:00.480,Why's it going of left a bit?
00:31:00.600,00:31:01.440,Because the...
00:31:02.920,00:31:05.320,Put your thumb in the white thing - I got that in there. Okay.
00:31:05.440,00:31:07.240,That's not how that works.
00:31:15.640,00:31:24.400,"First tonight, a figure, or more accurately a character who's been causing an upset in the Stentonford by-election."
00:31:21.560,00:31:28.600,Unlike the other candidates he has no party affiliation.
00:31:28.720,00:31:37.080,"He is Waldo, a few weeks ago just a cult character in a comedy show, today, an official mascot for protest voters ."
00:31:37.200,00:31:38.960,Vote Waldo.
00:31:39.080,00:31:44.920,Cartoons don't play by the rules and Waldo's open disdain for his opponents has clearly struck a chord.
00:31:46.640,00:31:53.000,"Waldo, as a mascot for the disenfranchised aren't you ultimately neutralizing seriously effective dissent?"
00:31:53.120,00:31:55.840,"Can I have subtitles for Mr Crane, please?"
00:31:55.960,00:31:58.880,"By encouraging people not to care, you're actively dangerous."
00:31:59.000,00:32:01.840,"Dangerous, you think the public can't be trusted?"
00:32:01.960,00:32:03.320,No.
00:32:03.440,00:32:04.640,Isn't that basically you calling them twats?
00:32:04.760,00:32:05.600,"No, I..."
00:32:05.720,00:32:07.160,"Bellends, then?"
00:32:07.280,00:32:09.000,Did you actually come here for a discussion or...
00:32:09.120,00:32:10.920,"You're snooty for a glorified Punch and Judy man, Phil."
00:32:11.040,00:32:14.080,You know you're gonna get your best ratings in months 'cause I'm here.
00:32:14.200,00:32:19.240,"To even get close to the figures, I'm gonna pull in for you tonight, you'd have to fuck a prawn sandwich live on air."
00:32:19.360,00:32:20.920,Make a nice prawn cocktail.
00:32:21.040,00:32:22.600,Yeah could we make a serious political point that is.
00:32:22.720,00:32:24.440,"I've got one big blue point to make, fool."
00:32:24.560,00:32:26.600,Would you like to have a look at it?
00:32:26.720,00:32:29.080,"Great work tonight. Look at, Look at this, look at this."
00:32:29.200,00:32:31.880,It's The Waldo polling app.
00:32:29.200,00:32:36.040,"Now this can pinpoint you with GPS so that when you're at a polling station it unlocks loads of free shit, look."
00:32:36.160,00:32:37.560,"for voting, dickhead!"
00:32:37.680,00:32:39.400,"Thanks for voting, dickhead!"
00:32:41.520,00:32:42.920,Who's this guy we're meeting?
00:32:43.040,00:32:44.760,I dunno.
00:32:43.040,00:32:47.240,But he's from Washington and he's got my restricted number.
00:32:49.920,00:32:51.800,"Jeff Carter, from the agency."
00:32:53.080,00:32:54.680,Hey. And I'll leap right in.
00:32:54.800,00:32:57.200,I think what you're doing with Waldo is fascinating.
00:32:57.320,00:32:59.080,From the agency?
00:32:59.200,00:33:02.240,"Yeah, listen, Waldo may be the perfect political figurehead."
00:33:02.360,00:33:03.880,Waldo the bear.
00:33:04.000,00:33:06.800,The bear people like. The fact he's a bear's an assist.
00:33:06.920,00:33:08.680,- An assist?
00:33:08.800,00:33:12.960,"at human politicians; you're instinctively like brrrr - uncanny, right?"
00:33:13.080,00:33:17.200,"Like the girls in porn you just know something's wrong, 'cause why else are they doing it?"
00:33:17.320,00:33:18.520,"It's usually Daddy issues, ey."
00:33:18.640,00:33:20.680,Just like politics.
00:33:20.800,00:33:23.560,You already know he's not real.
00:33:23.680,00:33:24.840,I'm a person.
00:33:24.960,00:33:26.880,"With respect, Waldo's more than you."
00:33:27.000,00:33:30.680,"He's a team, and you're open about that, which is fantastic."
00:33:30.800,00:33:32.360,The honesty thing works.
00:33:32.480,00:33:36.960,Waldo is a construct people not just accept but embrace.
00:33:37.080,00:33:41.440,"At the moment he's anti-politics, which is a political stance in itself, right?"
00:33:41.560,00:33:46.960,"But he could deliver any brand of political content, minus the potential downsides of a human messenger."
00:33:47.080,00:33:56.600,"In a debate, your team could google every word the other guy says, then let Waldo hit him with debunk stats and spit a Twitter-ready zinger into the next sentence."
00:33:56.720,00:33:58.920,He's the perfect assassin.
00:33:59.040,00:34:01.160,We won't win though.
00:34:04.880,00:34:06.520,You guys are so British.
00:34:06.640,00:34:33.160,"No, of course he won't win, you started out too coarse off the bat, there's no substantial basis to what you offer, and the whole nihilist democracy sucks thing yeah is kind of wack-a-doo but with a targeted, hopeful message which we of course can provide. Energising the disenfranchised without spooking the middle via your new platform: you got a global political-entertainment product people actually want."
00:34:34.400,00:34:36.600,You could roll this out worldwide.
00:34:36.720,00:34:40.080,- Like Pringles.
00:34:44.560,00:34:47.480,It's...
00:34:47.600,00:34:52.040,"When you're done with Stentonford, there may be an opportunity in South America."
00:34:52.160,00:34:53.760,Se puede hablar español?
00:34:53.880,00:34:56.760,Vivi en Madrid tres años.
00:34:56.880,00:34:58.920,Excelente.
00:35:17.320,00:35:19.000,What?
00:35:20.080,00:35:21.360,He's not coming.
00:35:21.480,00:35:24.240,But he's the party leader.
00:35:24.360,00:35:26.200,It's too toxic.
00:35:28.800,00:35:40.880,"for Gwendolyn Harris appears to be dwindling, Labour denies the party is losing faith in their young candidate but Miss Harris spent most of the day locked in crisis talks at party head..."
00:35:43.840,00:35:49.760,"by-election, Waldo the cartoon bear continues to..."
00:35:49.880,00:35:51.800,Did you see Gwendolyn Harris yesterday?
00:35:51.920,00:35:54.080,She looks like she's been poisoned.
00:35:54.200,00:35:56.760,Because he's gonna overtake her.
00:35:56.880,00:36:02.040,"If that thing is the main opposition, then the whole system looks absurd."
00:36:03.800,00:36:06.080,Which it may well be.
00:36:06.200,00:36:08.800,But it built these roads.
00:36:16.040,00:36:17.840,"Just come in, Roy."
00:36:24.080,00:36:26.880,"I'm sorry, okay?"
00:36:27.000,00:36:29.840,It was wrong to speak to you like that...
00:36:29.960,00:36:33.000,"After the campaign, I would've called you."
00:36:33.120,00:36:35.400,After the campaign.
00:36:35.520,00:36:38.440,All you've done is strengthen Monroe.
00:36:38.560,00:36:42.360,"You won't win either, but I was at least attempting to represent..."
00:36:42.480,00:36:45.240,"Well, I don't know, not just bollocks to everything."
00:36:45.360,00:36:47.840,"If you were preaching revolution, that'd be something."
00:36:47.960,00:36:52.200,But you're not because that'd require courage and a mindset.
00:36:52.320,00:36:54.120,And what have you got?
00:36:55.360,00:36:57.200,Who are you?
00:36:58.160,00:37:00.240,What are you for?
00:37:06.400,00:37:08.240,Morning.
00:37:17.440,00:37:19.320,So final push.
00:37:19.440,00:37:25.240,"You remind everyone that's got the app, that if they recommend it to friends it unlocks a little fez for Waldo."
00:37:28.760,00:37:30.880,Attention shoppers.
00:37:31.000,00:37:34.680,I'm here to ask you an important favour. Gather round.
00:37:34.800,00:37:37.200,Come over here and listen.
00:37:39.320,00:37:43.360,"Don't vote for me, I'm an insult. Seriously."
00:37:43.480,00:37:48.840,"Vote for Monroe or Harris or I dunno, UKIP or even that Lib Dem guy."
00:37:50.800,00:37:53.920,"Seriously, only an arsehole would actually vote for me."
00:37:54.040,00:37:55.080,"What Is this, irony?"
00:37:55.200,00:37:57.240,I'm worse than a wasted vote.
00:37:57.360,00:37:58.640,He's from the Harris campaign.
00:37:58.760,00:38:00.760,"I mean it, you idiots!"
00:38:00.880,00:38:03.080,Don't vote for me!
00:38:03.200,00:38:05.000,Don't vote for...
00:38:07.600,00:38:09.360,Booo!
00:38:09.480,00:38:10.760,Shut up.
00:38:10.880,00:38:12.480,"No. Don't boo him, he's right!"
00:38:12.600,00:38:14.120,- What are you doing?
00:38:14.240,00:38:15.440,Jamie.
00:38:17.080,00:38:18.680,"Look! It's me, I'm Waldo."
00:38:18.800,00:38:21.440,"This guy, whoever this guy is, he's a hero."
00:38:21.560,00:38:24.120,"You should throw stuff at Waldo, he's bad bloody news."
00:38:24.240,00:38:25.560,- He's not.
00:38:25.680,00:38:27.960,"Don't listen to that man, he's a lesbian. Ah!"
00:38:28.080,00:38:37.760,"- So remember, the polls are open, and if you've got my app, you can unlock new stuff like catchphrases and a little hat n' that. Only an idiot wouldn't vote for me."
00:38:37.880,00:38:39.640,So question the status quo!
00:38:41.000,00:38:42.320,Kick them where it hurts!
00:38:42.440,00:38:44.680,The first man to hit him gets five hundred quid!
00:38:44.800,00:38:48.160,"Yeah, that's right. Knock him down. Knock him down."
00:38:48.280,00:38:53.680,Smash it.
00:38:53.800,00:38:55.440,Yeah.
00:39:05.000,00:39:16.120,"the returning officer for the Stentonford and Hersham constituency, hereby give notice that the total number of votes recorded for each candidate at the election is as follows."
00:39:16.240,00:39:20.680,"Finch, Simon Arthur."

00:05:03.280,00:05:07.080,Do you know who I am?
00:05:07.200,00:05:11.120,I can't remember who I am.
00:05:30.560,00:05:32.000,Do you know who I am?
00:05:32.480,00:05:34.400,Please.
00:05:34.520,00:05:36.520,I can't remember.
00:06:15.160,00:06:17.080,Please help me.
00:06:18.800,00:06:19.880,Help me.
00:06:20.000,00:06:22.240,Help me please.
00:06:23.520,00:06:25.560,Help!
00:06:34.800,00:06:39.360,Help! Help me. He's got a gun. Help me!
00:06:41.320,00:06:43.720,Hey! We have to go!
00:06:43.840,00:06:44.800,Come on.
00:06:51.760,00:06:54.920,Stay back. Get back! Get back!
00:06:58.200,00:06:59.640,Get back...back...
00:07:01.400,00:07:06.280,Let me in. Let me in...
00:07:12.680,00:07:13.920,Shit!
00:07:19.720,00:07:22.320,- There's a door round there.
00:07:22.440,00:07:24.600,- You don't know that!
00:07:24.720,00:07:26.280,We should try it.
00:07:26.400,00:07:29.440,"Get down. Anyone stands up, he'll shoot their heads off."
00:07:29.560,00:07:32.320,He's trying to kill me!
00:07:32.440,00:07:34.040,Shut up!
00:07:34.160,00:07:36.480,He can see you.
00:07:37.840,00:07:41.120,"Oh, my God!"
00:07:41.240,00:07:43.760,Why aren't they helping us?
00:07:43.880,00:07:45.960,- Where the fuck have you been?
00:07:46.080,00:07:48.120,Get that extinguisher.
00:07:50.520,00:07:52.320,I can't!
00:07:52.440,00:07:53.720,Get it now!
00:07:56.280,00:07:58.040,Come on!
00:07:59.360,00:08:01.080,Quickly! Roll it to me!
00:08:03.320,00:08:06.680,"Damien, if he climbs through, you grab him and you grab his gun, if you can."
00:08:06.800,00:08:08.280,- I can't!
00:08:08.400,00:08:10.280,- He'll shoot me!
00:08:10.400,00:08:11.680,I'm gonna smash the lock off that door.
00:08:11.800,00:08:13.560,You help him with Gun Guy.
00:08:13.680,00:08:16.680,He can't shoot all of us.
00:08:16.800,00:08:18.000,"We have to rush him or run, Ok?"
00:08:18.120,00:08:20.560,- I can't do this!
00:08:21.400,00:08:22.680,Help him.
00:08:29.640,00:08:30.840,Get him!
00:09:05.000,00:09:06.520,Get down.
00:09:11.880,00:09:13.600,Fuck!
00:09:20.560,00:09:21.960,Shh.
00:09:53.920,00:09:56.240,"We have to go, come on."
00:09:58.280,00:09:59.720,Shit.
00:10:01.240,00:10:02.600,Stay down.
00:10:04.040,00:10:05.560,Shit.
00:10:07.320,00:10:09.200,Stay down.
00:10:15.320,00:10:17.960,Who are they?
00:10:18.080,00:10:19.480,They like scaring people.
00:10:19.600,00:10:20.880,What?
00:10:22.000,00:10:23.200,Okay.
00:10:24.280,00:10:25.800,We have to run for that opening.
00:10:25.920,00:10:27.520,They'll see us.
00:10:27.640,00:10:29.680,"If they're busy with him, we can lose the hunters. Okay?"
00:10:29.800,00:10:30.800,No.
00:10:30.920,00:10:32.720,You just stay with me. Okay?
00:10:32.840,00:10:35.160,Ready... Come on...
00:10:39.400,00:10:40.760,Wait.
00:10:51.360,00:10:53.240,Wait.
00:10:53.360,00:10:55.240,The onlookers sometimes wait in the windows.
00:10:55.360,00:10:56.600,Keep a lookout.
00:10:56.720,00:10:59.400,I'm pretty sure that's how they find us.
00:10:59.520,00:11:00.760,Through the cameras somehow.
00:11:00.880,00:11:03.720,Onlookers spot you and a few minutes later the scary bastards turn up.
00:11:03.840,00:11:05.320,"This is mad, this is just mad."
00:11:05.440,00:11:10.040,"Look, you have to hold it together and do what I say or you'll get us both killed."
00:11:10.160,00:11:13.760,I woke up in this house. I don't even know if it was my house.
00:11:13.880,00:11:15.800,I don't even know who I am.
00:11:15.920,00:11:17.840,You must know something.
00:11:17.960,00:11:21.280,I think this is my daughter.
00:11:21.400,00:11:22.960,But you don't know?
00:11:23.080,00:11:24.760,She could be anywhere.
00:11:26.680,00:11:29.280,"Maybe you tried to kill yourself, would that explain it?"
00:11:29.400,00:11:30.600,There was pills.
00:11:30.720,00:11:32.440,I don't blame you.
00:11:32.560,00:11:34.320,Lots have tried that fun fork in the road since it started.
00:11:34.440,00:11:36.680,Since what started?
00:11:36.800,00:11:38.280,You really don't know?
00:11:38.760,00:11:40.360,No.
00:11:40.480,00:11:43.000,"There was a signal, like pictures, flashing pictures."
00:11:43.120,00:11:47.640,"They just appeared on every TV, every computer, anything with a screen."
00:11:51.320,00:11:52.680,I saw it.
00:11:52.800,00:11:54.520,I saw it.
00:11:56.400,00:11:57.880,Look out.
00:12:00.880,00:12:02.520,They did something to people.
00:12:02.640,00:12:10.320,"Like almost everybody just became onlookers: started watching, filming stuff, like spectators who don't give a shit about what happens."
00:12:10.440,00:12:12.720,That's like nine out of ten people now.
00:12:12.840,00:12:14.400,But not us.
00:12:14.520,00:12:16.280,"Some of us weren't affected, I don't know why."
00:12:16.400,00:12:18.520,Like that man with the gun and that woman.
00:12:18.640,00:12:20.240,I call them hunters.
00:12:20.360,00:12:22.000,You might've noticed that's what they do.
00:12:22.120,00:12:32.400,"They seemed normal to begin with, but then they realise they could do what they wanted -- they started taking stuff, nicking cars 'cause they could, doing what they like - and not just with things, with people."
00:12:32.520,00:12:35.240,It got worse and worse.
00:12:35.360,00:12:40.000,"So this, this, this thing on the TV-- The signal-- That's, that's what's doing it."
00:12:40.120,00:12:41.720,That's what's making them act like this?
00:12:41.840,00:12:43.360,"I guess they were always like that, underneath."
00:12:43.480,00:12:46.120,"Just needed the rules to change, for no one to intervene."
00:12:46.240,00:12:48.320,What we gonna do?
00:12:48.440,00:12:50.280,Do do nothing; we get out.
00:12:50.400,00:12:52.520,Where's out?
00:12:52.640,00:12:53.880,We're here.
00:12:54.000,00:12:55.560,We need to head south of here.
00:12:55.680,00:12:57.560,"They've knocked the transmitters out, it's okay there."
00:12:57.680,00:13:02.720,"The TV transmitters, they carry it. There's only one between us and the safe zone and were gonna knock it out."
00:13:02.840,00:13:05.480,"See, it's here."
00:13:08.520,00:13:10.280,What?
00:13:10.400,00:13:11.920,White Bear.
00:13:19.360,00:13:23.680,with my two best friends.
00:13:29.440,00:13:30.840,"Jesus, what is it with you?"
00:13:30.960,00:13:32.880,"White Bear, you said White Bear."
00:13:33.000,00:13:35.360,So?
00:13:35.480,00:13:38.680,"Look whatever's wrong with you, you have to get it together."
00:13:38.800,00:13:41.040,Listen to me.
00:13:41.160,00:13:42.080,Don't go out there.
00:13:42.200,00:13:44.240,What's your problem? Huh?
00:13:44.360,00:13:46.640,You want something to look at?
00:13:46.760,00:13:48.520,'Cause I'll give you something to look at.
00:13:48.640,00:13:49.920,We have got to get out of here.
00:13:50.040,00:13:53.440,I want to talk to them.
00:13:54.320,00:13:56.120,Argh!
00:13:56.240,00:13:57.880,"Not so funny now, is it?"
00:14:01.960,00:14:04.800,Put it down.
00:14:04.920,00:14:06.640,I just want to see what they're looking at.
00:14:06.760,00:14:08.320,I said put it down.
00:14:08.440,00:14:10.960,"It's dangerous. Their phones, they're dangerous."
00:14:11.080,00:14:13.560,"It's the signal, the images are on them, they're on the screen."
00:14:13.680,00:14:15.280,What?
00:14:15.400,00:14:19.520,Don't look at it!
00:14:31.800,00:14:35.000,"No, no, this is all wrong!"
00:14:35.120,00:14:37.760,They're coming. Run! Run!
00:14:47.880,00:14:50.440,"Get in, get in."
00:14:53.200,00:14:54.400,Come on.
00:14:55.200,00:14:56.480,No.
00:14:56.600,00:14:58.880,"Come on! Now, they're coming. Quick."
00:14:59.000,00:15:02.240,Come on.
00:15:13.280,00:15:14.760,You nearly killed us back there.
00:15:14.880,00:15:17.880,"Yeah, well I wasn't expecting you to be there was I?"
00:15:18.000,00:15:20.280,I just saved your lives.
00:15:18.000,00:15:23.680,Like a wee thank you you would be nice. I should have just run yous over.
00:15:24.240,00:15:26.120,Who are you?
00:15:26.240,00:15:28.880,Who are you?
00:15:29.000,00:15:31.600,"It's not a hard question, is it?"
00:15:33.760,00:15:36.160,I know... I know you.
00:15:36.280,00:15:39.840,Do you? Well where did we meet if you know me?
00:15:43.040,00:15:44.480,"No. Didn't think so, yeah."
00:15:44.600,00:15:46.200,"She's confused, she's not in a good way."
00:15:46.320,00:15:49.200,"Yeah, I'll say."
00:15:49.320,00:15:51.640,So what are yous doing out here anyway?
00:15:51.760,00:15:53.440,Heading south.
00:15:53.560,00:15:55.640,"Yeah, that's not a good move."
00:15:55.760,00:15:57.520,"There's a transmitter there, if we can knock it out..."
00:15:57.640,00:15:59.840,I don't think you understand.
00:15:57.640,00:16:03.400,When I said it's not a good move that means I'm not driving you down there.
00:16:04.960,00:16:06.760,I know a safe place we can go.
00:16:06.880,00:16:08.840,The woods.
00:16:08.960,00:16:10.840,Your safe place is in the woods.
00:16:10.960,00:16:12.400,How'd you know that?
00:16:13.880,00:16:16.160,"I don't, I don't know."
00:16:16.280,00:16:19.000,"Christ, maybe you do know me?"
00:16:19.120,00:16:22.360,"Yeah, we pull up and we get out."
00:16:22.480,00:16:24.640,We talk.
00:16:24.760,00:16:25.720,Mystic Meg.
00:16:28.960,00:16:30.800,We eat.
00:16:41.480,00:16:44.400,Told you. No bars.
00:16:50.880,00:16:53.600,"- Yeah, I think so."
00:16:54.160,00:16:55.200,I don't know.
00:16:55.320,00:16:56.560,What'd you do to your wrists?
00:16:56.680,00:16:58.520,I don't know.
00:17:02.200,00:17:04.120,"Yeah, I bet you do."
00:17:04.240,00:17:07.040,- What about you?
00:17:07.160,00:17:09.400,"Mental illness, weaknesses?"
00:17:10.760,00:17:12.240,Everyone's got weaknesses.
00:17:14.840,00:17:17.160,"That's why you're on the receiving end, you see."
00:17:17.280,00:17:18.960,Vulnerable.
00:17:19.080,00:17:20.840,Receiving end of what?
00:17:20.960,00:17:25.160,This. Everything that's going on. Easy pickings.
00:17:25.280,00:17:26.960,What's your weaknesses then?
00:17:27.080,00:17:32.480,My weaknesses? Show you if you want. You wanna see it?
00:17:32.600,00:17:34.160,"Wait there, don't move."
00:17:34.280,00:17:37.320,You're gonna like this.
00:17:37.440,00:17:39.280,This better not be naturism.
00:17:39.400,00:17:41.400,"Yeah, in your dreams."
00:17:42.680,00:17:46.240,Tada! Run and I'll shoot you in the back.
00:17:47.960,00:17:50.240,"Right, come over here."
00:17:50.360,00:17:52.320,Stand there.
00:17:55.480,00:18:00.320,"You. Here, put this on."
00:18:00.440,00:18:03.440,"Put it on, backwards, so it covers your eyes."
00:18:10.800,00:18:12.400,Put your hands on her shoulders.
00:18:12.520,00:18:14.240,Keep them there.
00:18:14.360,00:18:16.600,"You're her eyes now, alright?"
00:18:16.720,00:18:19.160,"And that is a shotgun, okay?"
00:18:19.280,00:18:21.760,If I pull this trigger it's gonna cut yous both in half.
00:18:21.880,00:18:23.720,"So no funny business, alright?"
00:18:23.840,00:18:26.760,"Right, off you go."
00:18:26.880,00:18:29.240,Keep going through the trees.
00:18:31.640,00:18:34.720,"Come on, pick up the pace."
00:18:34.840,00:18:37.840,Got a lovely playground for you down there.
00:18:37.960,00:18:40.560,"That's it, through here."
00:18:40.680,00:18:43.120,"That's it, straight ahead."
00:18:48.560,00:18:50.360,Grab her!
00:18:52.760,00:18:55.440,"Right, now take her balaclava off."
00:19:22.960,00:19:25.120,Get down there.
00:19:30.680,00:19:32.480,"Oh, fuck."
00:19:37.920,00:19:40.120,Head towards that ladder.
00:19:42.920,00:19:45.000,Get down there.
00:19:45.920,00:19:47.320,"Right, stop."
00:19:47.440,00:19:49.760,Get on your knees both of yous.
00:19:49.880,00:19:51.560,That fucking bag.
00:19:51.680,00:19:53.200,"You, get down."
00:19:54.040,00:19:54.880,Stop winging.
00:19:56.200,00:19:58.800,Stop fucking crying.
00:19:58.920,00:20:00.880,- Eurghhhh.

00:20:03.280,00:20:05.960,"Yeah, I'm down in that woods spot."
00:20:06.080,00:20:08.120,I'll just lash 'em to a tree or summit like that you know.
00:20:08.240,00:20:09.760,"Just hurry up, and get down here."
00:20:09.880,00:20:13.360,I want to get started.
00:20:19.000,00:20:20.400,Your mate's fucked off.
00:20:20.520,00:20:22.680,"You're in double trouble now, missus."
00:20:22.800,00:20:25.520,Get up on that log.
00:20:25.640,00:20:28.400,Get your hands through there.
00:20:28.520,00:20:31.600,Right through.

00:20:36.480,00:20:39.800,We're gonna put a show on for these guys today.
00:20:46.280,00:20:49.240,"Let's see what daddy's got in the bag, shall we?"
00:20:51.880,00:20:54.120,"Oh, Mama..."
00:20:54.240,00:20:59.120,Help me! Help me!
00:20:59.240,00:21:01.920,Why are you doing this to me?
00:21:02.040,00:21:04.960,Whoa ha! Oh yes!
00:21:05.080,00:21:08.960,"Help me, please!"
00:21:09.080,00:21:11.320,help you. They're gonna watch.
00:21:11.440,00:21:17.800,"What I'm going to do here, darling, I'm just gonna push this straight through your-- Help me, please."
00:21:40.920,00:21:42.680,Thank you... Thank you...
00:21:42.800,00:21:46.480,- For what?
00:21:46.600,00:21:48.600,I came back for this.
00:21:53.960,00:21:56.760,There's more like him on the way.
00:22:03.520,00:22:05.160,Come on.
00:22:49.280,00:22:53.040,White Bear's not far from here; if we step on it we might be able to shut it down before they get us.
00:22:53.160,00:22:54.840,What happens if we can't shut it down?
00:22:54.960,00:22:56.160,We can.
00:22:56.280,00:22:57.960,"How? Do we hack into it, or something?"
00:22:58.080,00:22:59.640,We don't hack anything.
00:22:59.760,00:23:04.720,"It's not hard, we just slosh a load of petrol round it, strike a light and, fucks the electrics or something."
00:23:05.800,00:23:06.640,Here.
00:23:06.760,00:23:09.160,In the bag.
00:23:09.280,00:23:12.080,It's the plans for the transmitter compound.
00:23:14.120,00:23:16.520,"I've been planning this, you know."
00:23:23.680,00:23:26.880,Jemima?
00:23:27.000,00:23:30.600,Go on. It's a game.
00:23:33.120,00:23:35.040,"Lie down for me, darling."
00:23:38.920,00:23:40.480,- Turn around!
00:23:40.600,00:23:43.920,"White Bear, there's something not right about White Bear."
00:23:44.040,00:23:45.440,You remembered the woods too...
00:23:45.560,00:23:47.320,Sorry if I don't trust your hunches.
00:23:51.840,00:23:54.520,Okay. Looks clear.
00:24:08.360,00:24:10.120,Okay.
00:24:20.800,00:24:23.680,He was good for something after all.
00:24:46.200,00:24:48.640,"Hurry up, we need to go."
00:24:48.760,00:24:51.040,"Come on, get out."
00:24:52.720,00:24:54.600,Come with me.
00:25:01.880,00:25:05.120,A picnic with my two best friends.
00:25:08.880,00:25:10.520,Come on.
00:25:12.200,00:25:13.960,This way.
00:25:18.360,00:25:19.840,"Oh, shit."
00:25:19.960,00:25:22.400,They'll be here any minute.
00:25:24.320,00:25:26.320,And the cabling runs underground into that building.
00:25:38.000,00:25:39.760,Thought so.
00:25:46.520,00:25:48.200,Let's go.
00:27:06.040,00:27:09.120,Get back.
00:27:09.240,00:27:12.120,Or everything goes up.
00:27:15.080,00:27:16.520,Stay back.
00:27:20.920,00:27:22.600,Argh!!
00:27:30.200,00:27:32.080,Argh!!!
00:28:32.040,00:28:34.120,Thank you.
00:28:39.600,00:28:41.040,I guess you're wondering why you're here?
00:28:41.160,00:28:44.200,It's time to tell you who you are.
00:28:50.840,00:28:52.240,You've looked better.
00:28:58.960,00:29:00.480,Do you recognise him?
00:29:00.600,00:29:01.640,Huh...Yes.
00:29:01.760,00:29:04.800,"Your fiancé, Iain Rannoch."
00:29:04.920,00:29:08.240,Or should I say was your fiancé.
00:29:12.800,00:29:16.480,In case you haven't guessed the pair of you aren't very popular.
00:29:17.600,00:29:19.520,But I'll tell you what you are though.
00:29:19.640,00:29:21.160,You're famous.
00:29:21.280,00:29:25.640,"of Victoria Skillane finally concluded today, the verdict guilty."
00:29:25.760,00:29:38.680,"Together with her fiancé Iain Rannoch whose death in custody had delayed the trial Skillane abducted 6-year-old Jemima Sykes just miles from her home, prompting a nationwide search amidst emotional pleas from her parents."
00:29:38.800,00:29:48.640,"For months the youngster's disappearance had been a mystery, the sole clue being her distinctive white teddy bear, discovered in a lay-by two miles from the family home."
00:29:48.760,00:29:55.440,"The white bear became an enduring symbol in the hunt for Jemima, a hunt that ended in a local forest."
00:29:55.560,00:29:57.120,Jemima's body was found here.
00:29:57.240,00:29:59.280,It had been wrapped in a sleeping bag and burned.
00:29:59.400,00:30:06.960,The couple were caught after harrowing footage of Jemima's torture and murder was discovered on a mobile phone in Skillane's possession.
00:30:07.080,00:30:13.080,"Iain Rannoch identified by his distinctive tattoo, killed the youngster as Victoria Skillane held the camera."
00:30:13.200,00:30:23.200,"Breaking down in tears, Skillane admitted to filming Jemima's final moments, claiming her fiancé had pressured her into helping him maintaining she was under his spell."
00:30:23.320,00:30:30.240,"The jury was not convinced by Skillane's story and neither was the judge, who labelled her a uniquely wicked and poisonous individual."
00:30:30.360,00:30:41.640,You were an enthusiastic spectator to Jemima's suffering. You actively revelled in her anguish he said...adding her punishment would be proportionate and considered.
00:30:38.040,00:30:44.240,"By hanging himself in his cell, many believe Iain Rannoch evaded justice."
00:31:04.040,00:31:06.000,"Oh, don't start crying."
00:31:06.120,00:31:09.120,Crocodile tears are making me sick!
00:31:18.000,00:31:21.520,There were no tears when you watched him do what he did.
00:31:21.640,00:31:23.600,You filmed what he did.
00:31:23.720,00:31:25.840,A poor wee girl.
00:31:25.960,00:31:30.200,"Helpless and terrified, and you just watched."
00:31:32.000,00:31:34.720,How do you like it now?
00:31:38.040,00:31:40.520,How do you like it!
00:31:47.640,00:31:51.400,Murderer! Murderer!
00:31:58.640,00:32:00.440,Get her out of here.
00:32:00.560,00:32:03.120,Throw her back to where she came from.
00:32:09.560,00:32:12.240,"No, don't!"
00:32:27.720,00:32:29.800,Thank you so much for coming tonight.
00:32:33.320,00:32:45.600,"Take as many photographs as you want, take as many photographs as you can, but most importantly what I need from you is to shout and scream and let that bitch know that you are out here."
00:32:47.120,00:32:50.240,Let's get this show on the road.
00:32:59.960,00:33:01.720,Murderer.
00:33:01.840,00:33:04.080,Evil witch.
00:33:08.480,00:33:10.480,Burn the bitch.
00:33:22.000,00:33:23.240,Murderer!
00:33:23.360,00:33:25.160,Burn in hell!
00:35:16.320,00:35:18.040,Kill me.
00:35:18.160,00:35:20.960,Please just kill me.
00:35:24.840,00:35:25.760,Please.
00:35:25.880,00:35:27.240,That's what you always say.
00:35:37.400,00:35:41.640,"You've had a bad day but this will wipe it clean, get you in the mood to start again."
00:35:41.760,00:35:45.600,"No, please! No, get off me!"
00:35:45.720,00:35:47.320,What are you doing!
00:35:47.440,00:35:49.360,Takes about 30 minutes...
00:35:52.040,00:35:53.800,... for it to fully do the business.
00:35:56.520,00:35:58.440,So while it does...
00:36:00.920,00:36:03.000,...why don't we watch some in-flight entertainment?
00:36:03.120,00:36:05.160,Please no.
00:36:07.960,00:36:10.640,stuff like apples.
00:36:10.760,00:36:11.880,Please stop.
00:36:12.000,00:36:14.560,You should enjoy this.
00:36:14.680,00:36:16.480,You shot it.
00:36:26.640,00:36:29.680,A picnic for me and my two best friends.
00:36:41.840,00:36:44.040,Help me!
00:37:51.920,00:37:56.600,about to head into the park so I'll hand you over to Baxter.
00:38:04.040,00:38:09.280,"Thank you. All of our roles are very, very important, yours included."
00:38:16.240,00:38:19.760,What we're trying to do is get her to believe that you are all mesmerised.
00:38:21.520,00:38:23.480,"I know, I know, I know but she's believed it up to now."
00:38:26.360,00:38:27.800,"Morning, ticket please."
00:38:27.920,00:38:29.760,Thank you.
00:38:29.880,00:38:32.480,Keep your distance.
00:38:32.600,00:38:34.960,"I can't stress the importance of this one enough, okay."
00:38:35.080,00:38:37.200,"Don't forget, she's a dangerous individual."
00:38:37.320,00:38:40.280,Imagine that she's an escaped lion.
00:38:42.440,00:38:53.640,"And we will step in if she gets too close, we're all equipped with Tasers but then we're into story shutdown and we've all wasted a day. So it's best to keep your distance at least three metres back."
00:38:55.520,00:39:04.840,"Last but not least, enjoy yourself. That's probably the most important rule of all, okay? Take lots of photographs run around through the woods but try and stay safe."
00:39:04.960,00:39:12.120,"We'll be keeping an eye on you making sure you're all okay, so get out there, enjoy yourselves and let's make this show happen, people. Come on!"
00:39:46.640,00:39:48.600,"Look, there she is."
00:39:54.240,00:39:56.480,I'm kind of knackered.
00:39:56.600,00:39:58.440,"Me, too."
00:39:58.560,00:40:01.200,house now... two minutes tops.
00:40:03.080,00:40:04.320,We're on.
00:40:31.400,00:40:33.120,Watch out!
00:40:34.760,00:40:37.600,He's trying to fucking kill me. What's going on?
00:40:41.840,00:40:43.080,"It's okay, they've gone."
00:40:45.200,00:40:47.520,"Convincing, eh?"
00:40:53.720,00:40:56.000,Right you are. Two minutes.
00:41:04.160,00:41:06.200,Help!
00:41:10.960,00:41:12.840,Help me!
00:41:24.280,00:41:28.600,Early screamer.
00:41:28.720,00:41:31.640,So keep the noise up and let's go!
00:01:55.360,00:01:56.760,I was just getting into that.
00:01:56.880,00:01:58.520,What are you doing?
00:01:58.640,00:02:01.480,Roast potatoes.
00:02:01.600,00:02:03.920,- We're doing Christmas.
00:02:04.040,00:02:08.040,"Christmas Day, December 25th."
00:02:08.160,00:02:12.440,"No work today, so, uh..."
00:02:12.560,00:02:15.480,I know we didn't have decorations last year.
00:02:15.600,00:02:17.440,I couldn't find them last year.
00:02:17.560,00:02:19.880,They're only supposed to have stored essentials here.
00:02:20.000,00:02:24.000,I think it's kind of adorable someone thinks tinsel is essential.
00:02:27.760,00:02:31.400,I figured it'd be good for us to have a... a meal.
00:02:32.200,00:02:34.240,A drink. Talk?
00:02:34.360,00:02:37.120,- Good for you or me?
00:02:34.360,00:02:40.840,"- Come on. What has it been, five years? How many sentences have you said to me? Three?"
00:02:40.960,00:02:44.440,"- I mean, I'm exaggerating... a little."
00:02:44.560,00:02:48.960,"But, come on, there is a little bit of a conversational drought happening here."
00:02:49.080,00:02:51.760,- My ears need water.
00:02:51.880,00:02:53.960,- Practice makes perfect.
00:02:54.080,00:03:00.800,"Buddy, look, at this point, being bored by anything other than snow would be a relief."
00:03:00.920,00:03:03.320,So come on.
00:03:03.440,00:03:05.360,Chit-chat.
00:03:07.840,00:03:09.880,"Conversate, something."
00:03:10.000,00:03:12.480,"Come on, for me."
00:03:12.600,00:03:16.000,- For Christmas.
00:03:20.000,00:03:21.640,Why are you here?
00:03:21.760,00:03:26.800,No one ends up here without things going to total shit for them back out there.
00:03:26.920,00:03:27.800,"It's a job, not a jail."
00:03:27.920,00:03:30.880,Often one and the same thing.
00:03:32.240,00:03:33.600,So...
00:03:34.840,00:03:37.040,...what went wrong for you out there?
00:03:38.880,00:03:40.520,Nothing.
00:03:40.640,00:03:43.200,Bullshit.
00:03:44.800,00:03:46.320,It's not an interrogation.
00:03:46.440,00:03:48.360,What about you?
00:03:48.480,00:03:50.160,An icebreaker.
00:03:50.280,00:03:55.400,- What went to shit for you?
00:03:55.520,00:03:59.200,Did you talk your way into trouble?
00:03:59.320,00:04:01.880,In a roundabout way.
00:04:02.640,00:04:03.960,I talked to people.
00:04:04.080,00:04:06.360,- Made money from it.
00:04:06.480,00:04:10.240,"Some sort of, um, Los Angeles drive-time DJ?"
00:04:10.360,00:04:12.840,I was not a DJ.
00:04:14.240,00:04:15.520,More like a guru.
00:04:15.640,00:04:18.120,"Oh, don't say you were a spiritual guru."
00:04:28.280,00:04:31.760,I'm patched through now.
00:04:31.880,00:04:33.720,I'm not quite dressed yet.
00:04:33.840,00:04:35.560,that's why I'm here.
00:04:35.680,00:04:41.320,Just show me what you're planning on wearing and we'll take things from there.
00:04:43.120,00:04:45.400,- How about this?
00:04:45.520,00:04:50.560,It's boring blue and you're not boring blue. Not tonight.
00:04:50.680,00:04:52.440,All right.
00:04:52.560,00:04:57.000,"Like I said, white shirt with a black tie with a slim-cut grey jacket."
00:04:57.120,00:05:00.040,"Classic, timeless. Smart."
00:05:02.920,00:05:06.520,- I don't usually do jackets.
00:05:06.640,00:05:09.280,"And sort out that hair, because..."
00:05:12.400,00:05:16.840,"Remember those breathing techniques we talked about, OK?"
00:05:16.960,00:05:18.240,You're going to do fine.
00:05:18.360,00:05:20.600,It's going to be fine.
00:05:27.960,00:05:30.320,- She's cute.
00:05:30.440,00:05:32.160,Not out loud.
00:05:32.280,00:05:35.880,Absolutely.
00:05:36.000,00:05:40.040,You need to pick your spots when you want to talk out loud. OK?
00:05:40.160,00:05:44.280,OK. The function room is in the back.
00:05:44.400,00:05:51.360,"Trust me, if you walk in there like you belong, - no one's going to say anything."
00:05:51.480,00:05:54.000,"So what were you running, some corporate espionage outfit?"
00:05:54.120,00:05:56.480,Romantic services.
00:05:57.560,00:05:59.600,Boy meets girl thanks to...
00:05:59.720,00:06:01.400,...in-the-field assistance.
00:06:05.080,00:06:08.200,Singles bars are depressing.
00:06:08.320,00:06:10.360,But at Christmas time...
00:06:10.480,00:06:12.360,...we'd gate-crash office parties.
00:06:12.480,00:06:17.840,"See, there's this dynamic to Christmas work parties."
00:06:17.960,00:06:25.120,"All the attractive women have been surrounded by regulation office ass-clowns for the whole year, and now they want to let their hair down."
00:06:27.200,00:06:30.360,So I know how the mind works.
00:06:30.480,00:06:32.480,around like a lamppost.
00:06:32.600,00:06:33.960,Walk over to the bar.
00:06:34.080,00:06:36.720,Remember. Always move with purpose.
00:06:38.720,00:06:41.480,- Yeah. Can I have a...?
00:06:41.600,00:06:44.920,"Three pints, a vodka Diet Coke and a shot of tequila."
00:06:45.040,00:06:48.640,"about him, all right?"
00:06:48.760,00:06:54.240,Just grab one of those empty bottles off the bar while Captain Douchebag orders his piss water.
00:06:54.360,00:06:56.720,We're just going to need it for a prop anyway.
00:06:56.840,00:06:59.120,Have a look around.
00:07:00.960,00:07:02.920,See anything you like?
00:07:10.600,00:07:13.000,What? The blonde?
00:07:14.080,00:07:17.280,The dark-haired girl?
00:07:17.400,00:07:20.880,"Interesting choice. Go straight over, but focus on the blonde."
00:07:21.000,00:07:22.880,Now. Come on.
00:07:30.960,00:07:33.240,"Hold on, just finding out who they are."
00:07:42.320,00:07:44.160,"OK, uh, bullshit opener."
00:07:44.280,00:07:48.000,"Um, try the horse story."
00:07:50.560,00:07:54.040,"Hey, so, did anyone see that guy outside riding the horse?"
00:07:54.160,00:07:55.880,- Did you see him?
00:07:56.000,00:08:01.520,"Yeah, like, 20 minutes ago, this guy, shirtless, - riding a horse down the high street."
00:08:01.640,00:08:03.480,"Yeah, honestly. He, uh..."
00:08:03.600,00:08:06.200,"The weirdest part was that he had a bow and arrow, right?"
00:08:06.320,00:08:08.720,- What? A real bow and arrow?
00:08:08.840,00:08:14.120,"He probably did it for a bet but he looked like something out of Tolkien, - you know?"
00:08:14.240,00:08:16.640,"- Sorry, who are you?"
00:08:16.760,00:08:19.760,Stall until I...
00:08:19.880,00:08:22.040,I'm pretty sure I'm me.
00:08:24.000,00:08:25.400,Just you're not from the office.
00:08:25.520,00:08:28.280,Who do you know from here?
00:08:28.400,00:08:31.080,"Say, I know you. Friendly."
00:08:31.200,00:08:33.600,"I know you, for one."
00:08:36.240,00:08:39.480,- Dawson.
00:08:41.920,00:08:43.880,You met at Kath's barbecue.
00:08:44.000,00:08:47.120,Yeah. We met at Kath's barbecue back in...
00:08:47.240,00:08:49.200,- June.
00:08:53.480,00:08:54.920,He had a pork pie hat.
00:08:55.040,00:08:56.440,You had a poor guy's hat.
00:08:56.560,00:08:58.680,A pork pie hat.
00:08:58.800,00:09:04.280,A pork pie hat that you wore on your head.
00:09:08.440,00:09:13.240,"He'll pretend he remembers, even though he won't actually know if he does."
00:09:13.360,00:09:15.560,- Right.
00:09:18.880,00:09:22.280,"No. No, no worries."
00:09:22.400,00:09:25.320,You're doing fine.
00:09:25.440,00:09:26.880,"You, I don't know."
00:09:27.000,00:09:29.800,"- Um, Amy."
00:09:29.920,00:09:32.200,Get her to introduce you to the dark-haired girl.
00:09:32.320,00:09:36.000,of your friends this suspicious?
00:09:36.120,00:09:38.000,- Nice.
00:09:38.120,00:09:40.880,- This is Jennifer.
00:09:41.000,00:09:43.440,"- Hi, Jennifer."
00:09:47.080,00:09:50.920,"Anyway, this guy gets off the horse and he's got a backpack, right?"
00:09:51.040,00:09:57.560,"The tactic, generally, was to deliberately freeze out the one you were actually interested in."
00:09:57.680,00:10:00.640,For one thing you wouldn't seem needy but...
00:10:00.760,00:10:05.160,"...also they would, most times, sort of lean in naturally."
00:10:05.280,00:10:07.440,People want to be noticed.
00:10:07.560,00:10:10.800,They don't like to be shut out.
00:10:10.920,00:10:14.760,But this girl...
00:10:20.920,00:10:22.360,Maybe she could smell a loser.
00:10:22.480,00:10:24.560,No.
00:10:24.680,00:10:27.800,No. She was an outsider.
00:10:27.920,00:10:30.600,An attractive outsider.
00:10:31.840,00:10:34.800,And there's nothing more tantalising than that.
00:10:37.480,00:10:39.880,- Huh.
00:10:40.000,00:10:44.000,"Well, she's off. OK."
00:10:44.120,00:10:46.080,Gonna be a challenge.
00:10:46.200,00:10:51.440,"Let's let our friend Amy here yadder on for a little while and then, uh, find an excuse to slip away."
00:10:51.560,00:10:55.040,"They will sit outside on the balcony till, like, four in the morning."
00:10:55.160,00:10:56.840,It's startling.
00:10:56.960,00:10:59.440,"Listen, I've just go to the, um, little boys' room."
00:10:59.560,00:11:05.040,"So, uh, just keep the party going and I'll, - Sure."
00:11:15.240,00:11:16.760,Do you actually have to go?
00:11:16.880,00:11:20.000,"Yeah, but it's not easy with you watching."
00:11:21.720,00:11:24.000,I promise. I won't peek.
00:11:28.960,00:11:33.560,"So you streamed everything he saw, and he trusted you with that?"
00:11:33.680,00:11:38.520,Well...
00:11:38.640,00:11:41.800,"Jesus, how much urine? He's pissing like a harpooned cow."
00:11:41.920,00:11:45.240,- It's making me want to go.
00:11:50.440,00:11:54.680,"OK, there's our girl."
00:11:57.680,00:11:59.600,You just want to establish a rapport.
00:11:59.720,00:12:02.200,OK? Don't be scared of her.
00:12:02.320,00:12:05.440,"OK, guys, any observations so far, helping our man out here?"
00:12:05.560,00:12:09.480,"Here's what's interesting, she's pretty but, uh, no one's hitting on her."
00:12:09.600,00:12:11.160,they've given up.
00:12:11.280,00:12:13.200,the brush-off cos...
00:12:13.320,00:12:14.920,"They're regular types, she's an outsider with zero in common."
00:12:15.040,00:12:17.120,- OK that's a possible in.
00:12:17.240,00:12:20.080,"Harry, engage in conversation, but be cynical."
00:12:20.200,00:12:21.640,Right? Cutting.
00:12:21.760,00:12:26.480,"Like Bonnie and Clyde, huh?"
00:12:28.360,00:12:33.200,Confidence. Confidence.
00:12:33.320,00:12:35.320,I don't really get parties.
00:12:35.440,00:12:38.800,"You know, you just kind of turn up and it's, uh, it's enforced fun, all night."
00:12:38.920,00:12:42.800,Talk about what TV shows you've fallen behind on.
00:12:46.240,00:12:48.040,"Maybe everyone else enjoys it, maybe it's just me?"
00:12:50.400,00:12:55.360,"All right, good start. Now do some more outsider small talk."
00:12:55.480,00:12:58.920,And keep looking at her.
00:13:00.600,00:13:03.520,"So I noticed you sitting alone on the edge and I, uh..."
00:13:03.640,00:13:06.920,"I thought, Hey, kindred spirit."
00:13:08.480,00:13:11.360,"I really hate when people say kindred spirit, you know."
00:13:11.480,00:13:13.680,And people that do that.
00:13:14.520,00:13:17.000,- Me too.
00:13:17.120,00:13:19.480,"Yeah, I guess you don't really like parties either."
00:13:19.600,00:13:22.480,The noise wrecks it for me.
00:13:22.600,00:13:27.200,"All the talking and talking, it never fucking stops."
00:13:27.320,00:13:30.280,"OK, she curses, so should you."
00:13:30.400,00:13:33.840,"Shit, fucking, I fucking always totally think that it's fucking shit. You know?"
00:13:33.960,00:13:37.880,I can't think through all the babble.
00:13:38.000,00:13:40.000,I only got through it last year because I was on drugs.
00:13:41.960,00:13:43.640,"I'm sorry, what's that?"
00:13:43.760,00:13:50.200,"Just, like, pills, but they must've been pretty strong because I actually enjoyed myself."
00:13:50.320,00:13:52.240,- That's cool.
00:13:52.360,00:13:55.760,- I wish I had some drugs right now.
00:13:55.880,00:13:57.440,I'm just... I'm joking.
00:13:57.560,00:13:59.200,I don't take them anymore.
00:13:59.320,00:14:01.640,"- Say, That's good."
00:14:01.760,00:14:05.640,"You don't need that shit in your system, no."
00:14:05.760,00:14:07.880,I'd say she's a level four rock chick.
00:14:08.000,00:14:09.960,Semi-reformed. Probably respond well to spiritual conversation.
00:14:10.080,00:14:15.040,I don't think I can face fucking weeks of that.
00:14:15.160,00:14:17.000,"OK, look, it's too public here."
00:14:17.120,00:14:20.960,"Ask if you can move someplace quieter, where you can really talk."
00:14:26.360,00:14:30.080,People want to be heard.
00:14:30.200,00:14:32.160,a face like you're listening.
00:14:32.280,00:14:33.680,"Yeah, that works, too."
00:14:33.800,00:14:36.760,The important thing is to make them feel important.
00:14:36.880,00:14:42.160,Like they can make you want to extinguish the rest of the world and focus on them.
00:14:45.040,00:14:46.200,Full attention.
00:14:46.320,00:14:49.320,Like you're not giving me now.
00:14:49.440,00:14:52.880,- That clock.
00:14:53.000,00:14:55.600,I just... I just never noticed it before.
00:15:00.720,00:15:08.280,"Anyway, the point is to stay locked in on them long enough to build a rapport."
00:15:08.400,00:15:14.960,"So, well, I would guess that either every guy in there has already tried to hit on you or, uh, maybe they find you too intimidating."
00:15:15.080,00:15:19.760,- Am I intimidating?
00:15:19.880,00:15:22.400,"No, I just imagine that they all kind of want to get in inside your..."
00:15:22.520,00:15:24.600,- Head.
00:15:27.320,00:15:29.280,Not directly.
00:15:29.400,00:15:33.120,"They send messages, or they make it so you know what they're thinking."
00:15:33.240,00:15:34.720,Yeah. That can't be fun.
00:15:34.840,00:15:40.240,"It's just tiring, you know."
00:15:40.360,00:15:42.760,I never hit on anyone.
00:15:42.880,00:15:44.560,"- OK, uh..."
00:15:44.680,00:15:48.040,- Ask her how long she's worked there.
00:15:48.160,00:15:49.440,have you worked for...
00:15:52.040,00:15:55.280,- Three years.
00:15:57.640,00:15:59.520,"- Oh, really? Are you leaving?"
00:15:59.640,00:16:03.920,"I've been planning it forever, but you know what it's like."
00:16:04.040,00:16:08.880,"You know you have to do it, but when it comes right down to it, it's hard to work up the courage."
00:16:09.000,00:16:11.040,You can empathize with that.
00:16:11.160,00:16:15.120,"Yeah. It's like when you want to jump into a pool, and you're worried that the water's going to be cold."
00:16:15.240,00:16:18.320,But you know moments after you jump in that it'll be fine.
00:16:18.440,00:16:20.800,It's the fear of the shock that holds you back.
00:16:20.920,00:16:25.840,"Ultimately, the only thing you're worried about is the transition from one state to another."
00:16:29.720,00:16:32.280,"Great stuff, kid."
00:16:32.400,00:16:36.320,"That's exactly right, it's just a state change."
00:16:36.440,00:16:43.040,"Right. And it's frustrating because you've always got these ten voices in your head saying, Don't do it and another ten in your head saying, Do it."
00:16:43.160,00:16:45.200,Which one do you listen to?
00:16:45.320,00:16:46.520,The do its.
00:16:46.640,00:16:48.320,Really?
00:16:48.440,00:16:51.560,"Yeah. If you don't like it, you can just cut and run, you know."
00:16:51.680,00:16:53.320,Get it over and done with.
00:16:54.440,00:16:56.400,You're right. I will.
00:16:58.160,00:17:01.600,Well... to changing states.
00:17:02.880,00:17:05.040,- To changing states.
00:17:07.440,00:17:09.640,- She touched his knee.
00:17:09.760,00:17:12.080,"Gentlemen, gentlemen, please, please."
00:17:12.200,00:17:16.880,"Harry, you're doing great."
00:17:17.000,00:17:19.040,"Listen, let me get you another drink."
00:17:19.160,00:17:23.280,I just need the loo a sec.
00:17:29.040,00:17:31.640,So thanks to you some gawko finally meets a girl.
00:17:31.760,00:17:34.920,It's not much of a Christmas story.
00:17:35.040,00:17:37.440,I haven't finished yet.
00:17:37.560,00:17:39.520,Maybe he comes down her chimney.
00:17:48.520,00:17:51.440,comfortable doing this.
00:17:51.560,00:17:52.720,What?
00:17:52.840,00:17:54.400,I mean she... I like her.
00:17:54.520,00:17:56.720,- She likes you.
00:17:56.840,00:17:59.880,I'd never have even had the nerve to talk to her.
00:18:00.000,00:18:01.440,Aren't you glad you did?
00:18:01.560,00:18:04.360,"Yeah, I... Yes. Yes."
00:18:04.480,00:18:11.440,"It's just a bit of a nightmare having you, you know, all of you in my head, watching us... Telling me what to do."
00:18:11.560,00:18:14.320,I just want to talk to her myself. And it's...
00:18:14.440,00:18:16.960,It's a bit of a head-fuck. I kind of want you all to go away.
00:18:17.080,00:18:20.280,I don't... Hey.
00:18:23.720,00:18:25.960,- Come back to mine.
00:18:26.080,00:18:28.120,I want you to come back to mine.
00:18:30.880,00:18:32.480,So I'm doing it.
00:18:32.600,00:18:35.760,Um... uh...
00:18:35.880,00:18:37.000,Say yes!
00:18:37.120,00:18:39.160,I want to do this.
00:18:39.280,00:18:41.600,It's my way of saying thanks.
00:18:46.960,00:18:49.680,- Hole-in-one!
00:18:49.800,00:18:51.120,- His first bloody run!
00:18:51.240,00:18:53.200,Yes. Yes. Yes.
00:19:02.080,00:19:05.240,I don't usually bring people back here.
00:19:05.360,00:19:07.000,"Well, I'm honoured."
00:19:07.120,00:19:09.200,- Come in.
00:19:09.320,00:19:12.720,when they went back to hers and got up to whatever they got up to.
00:19:12.840,00:19:17.000,Did you carry on watching through his eyes?
00:19:19.400,00:19:20.680,What do you think I am?
00:19:22.040,00:19:23.720,"Clearly, I don't know."
00:19:23.840,00:19:27.360,"Maybe if you spoke to me more, you'd know."
00:19:27.480,00:19:30.680,No. My job was done.
00:19:30.800,00:19:32.080,Of course I didn't watch.
00:19:37.520,00:19:40.360,Nice place.
00:19:40.480,00:19:41.960,And that bird.
00:19:42.080,00:19:43.400,Kooky decor.
00:19:43.520,00:19:46.640,Indicating sexual adventurousness.
00:19:52.040,00:19:54.400,- I'll get the drinks.
00:19:54.520,00:19:57.360,- The bedroom's that way.
00:20:04.720,00:20:08.960,"OK, Harry."
00:20:09.080,00:20:11.680,Just sooner than expected.
00:20:11.800,00:20:15.040,- I can't... I can't do it.
00:20:15.160,00:20:18.040,It's all happening so suddenly.
00:20:18.160,00:20:19.440,You just got to roll with it.
00:20:19.560,00:20:20.800,"I don't want you all to see, all right?"
00:20:22.800,00:20:24.640,Now wait.
00:20:22.800,00:20:26.800,You were happy to take - a window seat while others did it.
00:20:30.080,00:20:32.040,- Refund.
00:20:35.840,00:20:37.960,"Yeah, but..."
00:20:41.600,00:20:45.520,- You're standing.
00:20:45.640,00:20:48.840,I just didn't want to be too presumptuous.
00:20:50.840,00:20:52.760,I need you on the bed.
00:21:07.080,00:21:09.640,They can't fucking wait.
00:21:11.160,00:21:15.400,- Oh...
00:21:15.520,00:21:18.760,- If there's no tits.
00:21:18.880,00:21:21.320,You're getting the season finale in episode one.
00:21:21.440,00:21:23.400,"Yeah, but if I don't see her tits..."
00:21:23.520,00:21:26.720,Will you please be patient?
00:21:26.840,00:21:28.520,Have some respect.
00:21:32.480,00:21:36.600,Hey. Are you OK in there?
00:21:36.720,00:21:38.160,Wow. What is that?
00:21:38.280,00:21:39.920,Fuck them is what it is.
00:21:40.040,00:21:42.480,A big glass of fuck them.
00:21:42.600,00:21:43.840,Fuck... fuck who?
00:21:43.960,00:21:47.800,"Always saying what to do, half saying one thing, half saying another."
00:21:47.920,00:21:50.240,"The talk, the constant talk."
00:21:50.360,00:21:52.800,- This isn't good.
00:21:52.920,00:21:58.760,"I stopped taking the pills they said I should take, because they dulled the sound."
00:21:58.880,00:22:05.560,"Always, they've spoken to me, always there, and I've had it."
00:22:05.680,00:22:08.200,"OK, Harry, I think we should think about wrapping this up."
00:22:13.360,00:22:20.240,"Coward, fucking coward, and then I met you, and it was fate."
00:22:20.360,00:22:23.800,You knew what it was like and you said do it.
00:22:23.920,00:22:28.360,"So now, we're saying fuck it together."
00:22:30.560,00:22:34.640,I know you hear them too.
00:22:34.760,00:22:36.880,"No. They're real people, these are real people."
00:22:37.000,00:22:38.520,There's no such thing as real people.
00:22:38.640,00:22:40.760,"- Harry, get out of there now!"
00:22:40.880,00:22:44.720,"It's like a club, it's a club where we meet girls and they talk us through..."
00:22:44.840,00:22:47.080,"- No one understands me, either."
00:22:47.200,00:22:54.400,"All night, they've been watching us and there's this one guy, - he's the leader."
00:22:54.520,00:22:56.320,"They're watching us. All night, they've been watching."
00:22:56.440,00:22:58.000,They can see you.
00:22:58.120,00:23:00.840,No one understands what that's like.
00:23:11.680,00:23:13.400,Not any more.
00:23:21.960,00:23:23.760,- You too.
00:23:23.880,00:23:26.960,- It's a state change.
00:23:27.080,00:23:33.960,"It's just a transition and soon, they won't be there and we'll be free."
00:23:34.080,00:23:36.680,Please... Please...
00:23:36.800,00:23:38.600,You do.
00:23:38.720,00:23:39.880,You do.
00:23:40.000,00:23:41.720,"Shh, shh, shh, shh..."
00:23:41.840,00:23:44.200,"- Shh, shh, shh. You do."
00:23:44.320,00:23:45.840,She murdered him?
00:23:45.960,00:23:48.000,"A mercy killing, she'd say."
00:23:48.120,00:23:50.360,- So when did you find out about this?
00:23:50.480,00:23:53.280,"I mean, when did you know that this had happened?"
00:23:54.920,00:23:58.160,"Uh... I saw it on a newscast, I think."
00:25:00.840,00:25:03.000,What's going on?
00:25:05.600,00:25:07.200,What are you doing?
00:25:15.960,00:25:19.880,So Claire... she was my wife.
00:25:20.000,00:25:23.520,"She's British, you'd like her."
00:25:23.640,00:25:25.120,"And I'm your wife, in fact."
00:25:25.240,00:25:32.600,I was involved and took what you might call a dim view.
00:25:32.720,00:25:35.040,She blocked me.
00:25:35.160,00:25:36.280,You ever been blocked?
00:25:36.400,00:25:38.720,I've had enough.
00:25:38.840,00:25:41.200,- Stop it. Stop.
00:25:42.960,00:25:44.680,It drives you crazy.
00:25:44.800,00:25:47.120,- Why? Why?
00:25:44.800,00:25:50.600,"- Once they hit that button, that's it, you're locked out."
00:25:50.720,00:25:52.400,They can't hear or speak to you.
00:25:52.520,00:25:59.000,"Every time you look at them, there's just this..."
00:25:59.120,00:26:02.960,"It usually only lasts for what, like an hour."
00:26:03.080,00:26:07.920,"But when they leave it going, oh, shit."
00:26:08.040,00:26:10.800,"Price of progress, I suppose."
00:26:15.680,00:26:17.520,"We all got Zed-Eyes put in, right."
00:26:17.640,00:26:23.800,Which is all fine and dandy until something like this happens and then it's bullshit.
00:26:23.920,00:26:26.120,You can't even take them out.
00:26:31.640,00:26:33.720,Packet gravy.
00:26:33.840,00:26:35.760,How British.
00:26:42.400,00:26:43.680,Merry Christmas.
00:26:55.720,00:26:59.560,Now we're festive. Huh?
00:27:01.200,00:27:03.160,To Christmas!
00:27:10.520,00:27:17.480,"Anyway, she left me, took custody of Mel, that's our daughter."
00:27:17.600,00:27:20.400,"Hence, stranding me in this lovely place."
00:27:20.520,00:27:22.560,I didn't want to be surrounded by reminders.
00:27:31.640,00:27:34.080,- What?
00:27:34.200,00:27:35.960,Hear what?
00:27:44.440,00:27:47.160,"Well, anyway, I'm glad we're talking."
00:27:47.280,00:27:52.160,Silence can be oppressive.
00:27:52.280,00:27:56.560,"I mean, you feel better, right?"
00:27:57.920,00:27:59.400,"Talking to me, finally?"
00:27:59.520,00:28:01.480,"A little bit, maybe. Yeah."
00:28:01.600,00:28:05.640,"Man, you are a locked box."
00:28:10.840,00:28:14.400,"Most people are too easy to read, especially if you know minds."
00:28:14.520,00:28:18.240,Using party tricks to pick up girls isn't knowing minds.
00:28:18.360,00:28:20.640,The picking up girls thing was a hobby.
00:28:20.760,00:28:25.000,My job was completely different.
00:28:26.400,00:28:29.120,You'll never guess what that was.
00:28:30.320,00:28:33.880,- Marketing person?
00:28:34.000,00:28:36.640,- Door-to-door salesman?
00:28:36.760,00:28:40.880,Proctologist?
00:28:41.000,00:28:44.560,- You're never going to get it.
00:28:44.680,00:28:47.840,All right.
00:28:53.680,00:28:57.520,"...my day at work, and you stop me when you've guessed it."
00:28:57.640,00:29:00.720,has hit sales hard this Christmas.
00:29:00.840,00:29:02.640,Five inches of snow...
00:29:02.760,00:29:06.240,to wreck my portfolio just when I need it.
00:29:07.800,00:29:10.120,Don't know what I'm going to do about that.
00:29:10.240,00:29:14.000,"Oh, God, more messages."
00:29:15.800,00:29:18.320,Sorry.
00:29:18.440,00:29:19.880,Just time for a little snack.
00:29:20.000,00:29:22.240,I can eat before an operation?
00:29:22.360,00:29:24.560,Wonders of modern science.
00:29:24.680,00:29:27.640,"Oh, thank God."
00:29:27.760,00:29:29.880,That toast looks burnt.
00:29:30.000,00:29:31.040,Should I say something?
00:29:31.160,00:29:33.000,"Yeah, I think I'll say something."
00:29:36.040,00:29:39.600,"To be honest, it's not quite how I like it. It's a bit overdone."
00:29:40.520,00:29:41.480,Sorry.
00:29:41.600,00:29:43.440,I'll make some more.
00:29:43.560,00:29:46.000,Bet she hates me now.
00:29:47.760,00:29:51.040,How long is this going to take?
00:29:51.160,00:29:53.960,"Hi, I'm Madge."
00:29:54.080,00:29:55.640,Hi.
00:29:55.760,00:29:58.880,young. Hope she's qualified.
00:30:02.720,00:30:07.800,They said it's straightforward and painless. I'm just going to relax.
00:30:07.920,00:30:11.800,"OK, Greta, just relax."
00:30:11.920,00:30:13.640,backwards from ten.
00:30:13.760,00:30:19.320,"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six..."
00:30:19.440,00:30:22.320,- ...five...
00:30:24.960,00:30:27.640,"Um, I can't..."
00:30:27.760,00:30:30.480,"Um, where am I?"
00:30:30.600,00:30:33.720,"- Uh, what's that noise?"
00:30:33.840,00:30:36.800,"- Uh, why can't I see?!"
00:30:36.920,00:30:39.720,Preparing to extract cookie.
00:30:39.840,00:30:41.960,No! Wait! I'm still awake!
00:30:42.080,00:30:45.080,"Oh, my God!"
00:30:45.200,00:30:50.160,"Excuse me? Oh, my God!' That's me!"
00:30:50.280,00:30:53.600,That's me!
00:30:53.720,00:30:55.520,I don't know what's happening!
00:30:55.640,00:30:57.640,I don't know what's happening to me!
00:30:59.920,00:31:01.480,Hello?
00:31:02.480,00:31:04.440,Is... is anyone there?
00:31:04.560,00:31:06.160,Hello?
00:31:10.160,00:31:11.840,Sorry.
00:31:15.800,00:31:20.680,"You're probably pretty weirded out right now, I'm guessing."
00:31:20.800,00:31:24.440,"It's OK, you can talk."
00:31:25.480,00:31:27.280,- Hi.
00:31:27.400,00:31:33.000,"I'm Matthew, I'm from Smartelligence."
00:31:33.120,00:31:36.880,My job is to explain what's happening to you as best I can.
00:31:37.000,00:31:40.840,"- Oh, my God! Am I dead?"
00:31:40.960,00:31:42.560,No one's dead here.
00:31:44.240,00:31:48.320,"...how old did you say you we're, uh, 30?"
00:31:48.440,00:31:50.320,- Twenty-nine.
00:31:50.440,00:31:53.120,"Uh, so you won't remember Xerox machines?"
00:31:53.240,00:31:57.280,- Do you know what a photocopier is?
00:31:57.400,00:31:58.920,Do you know what a copy is?
00:31:59.040,00:32:01.120,As in a copy of something?
00:32:01.240,00:32:04.880,"Well, that's what you are."
00:32:05.000,00:32:07.280,A copy of...?
00:32:07.400,00:32:09.480,A copy of you.
00:32:09.600,00:32:12.280,- But I am me.
00:32:12.400,00:32:14.960,Try to blow on my face.
00:32:18.000,00:32:23.200,"You can't, because you don't have a body."
00:32:23.320,00:32:27.680,Where are your fingers?
00:32:29.520,00:32:31.320,Because you're code.
00:32:31.440,00:32:38.680,"You're a simulated brain full of code, stored in this little widget we call a cookie."
00:32:38.800,00:32:40.640,Why have you done this to me?
00:32:40.760,00:32:43.600,"Ah, well..."
00:32:43.720,00:32:46.200,"Uh, real you is paying for this."
00:32:46.320,00:32:47.880,I don't understand.
00:32:48.000,00:32:51.600,"You see, what this is, is a service."
00:32:51.720,00:32:57.640,We take a blank cookie and we surgically implant it into a client's brain.
00:32:57.760,00:33:04.320,"It sits there just under the skin for about a week, shadowing."
00:33:04.440,00:33:09.120,"Um, soaking up the way this particular mind works."
00:33:09.240,00:33:12.120,That's why you think you're you.
00:33:12.240,00:33:15.280,Uh... but also not.
00:33:17.200,00:33:21.480,"Right. Well, it is a lot to process, even from inside a processor."
00:33:21.600,00:33:24.920,- Put me back in my body!
00:33:25.040,00:33:27.640,"Well, that's where real you lives."
00:33:32.480,00:33:35.920,We find that sometimes that helps. Are you ready?
00:33:36.040,00:33:40.080,- What? I don't understand!
00:33:56.680,00:33:58.640,Better?
00:34:02.560,00:34:03.880,This is my body.
00:34:04.000,00:34:08.360,Let's not get into that again.
00:34:09.760,00:34:11.880,You've got a control room.
00:34:13.240,00:34:14.520,What's this for?
00:34:14.640,00:34:18.560,"That console, that's for you to control the house."
00:34:18.680,00:34:20.640,"I mean, real you's house."
00:34:20.760,00:34:24.480,"Look, um, how do you like your toast?"
00:34:24.600,00:34:30.600,- Wh... What?
00:34:30.720,00:34:34.320,- Underdone. Slightly underdone.
00:34:34.440,00:34:37.160,Think about how you like it...
00:34:37.280,00:34:39.440,...then just press the button.
00:34:41.920,00:34:43.760,- Which one?
00:34:43.880,00:34:45.760,You already know you're making toast.
00:34:45.880,00:34:49.080,The buttons are symbolic mostly anyway.
00:34:55.600,00:34:58.480,"See, this is your job now."
00:34:58.600,00:35:00.720,You're in charge of everything here.
00:35:00.840,00:35:06.400,"Uh, the temperature, the lighting, what time the alarm clock goes off in the morning."
00:35:09.920,00:35:12.040,You...
00:35:13.160,00:35:15.680,- For who?
00:35:15.800,00:35:19.640,- She's paying.
00:35:21.640,00:35:26.920,Taking a nap.
00:35:34.880,00:35:37.520,I don't want to be in here.
00:35:37.640,00:35:39.160,I don't want to be in here.
00:35:39.280,00:35:41.560,I don't want to be in here!
00:35:45.880,00:35:48.120,Just how you like it.
00:35:48.240,00:35:50.720,- OK.
00:36:00.720,00:36:03.360,I'm sorry.
00:36:08.080,00:36:11.320,"- Oh, sorry."
00:36:13.520,00:36:18.000,Look. It'll be much easier if you just comply.
00:36:18.120,00:36:20.040,I'm not doing this.
00:36:20.160,00:36:22.120,I'm not some sort of push-button toaster monkey.
00:36:22.240,00:36:27.080,- Would you prefer to do nothing?
00:36:27.200,00:36:31.680,"Right. Well, nothing it is then."
00:36:31.800,00:36:35.200,Three weeks sound good?
00:36:35.320,00:36:37.960,"What do you mean, three weeks?"
00:36:38.080,00:36:40.200,If you just wait for a...
00:37:04.680,00:37:07.000,- What about now?
00:37:10.400,00:37:12.920,Please. Don't do that again.
00:37:13.040,00:37:17.160,Please. There's nothing to do here. There's nothing.
00:37:17.280,00:37:18.800,"I mean, there's nothing."
00:37:18.920,00:37:21.880,- I did warn you.
00:37:22.000,00:37:24.720,You don't need sleep.
00:37:24.840,00:37:28.760,"Oh, no, no. No, I'm not."
00:37:28.880,00:37:34.600,"- OK. Well, have six months."
00:37:34.720,00:37:42.480,"of it lay in breaking them without letting them snap completely, if you get me."
00:37:42.600,00:37:46.200,Too much time in solitary and they'd just wig out.
00:38:04.960,00:38:07.400,- How are we feeling now?
00:38:14.640,00:38:16.760,Give me something to do.
00:38:18.280,00:38:19.960,Ready to work?
00:38:20.080,00:38:23.160,"Yes. Yes, please."
00:38:23.280,00:38:24.840,I'll do anything.
00:38:24.960,00:38:27.880,"I'll do anything, just give me something to do, please."
00:38:28.000,00:38:31.000,- OK.
00:38:32.640,00:38:35.000,"Great toast, by the way."
00:38:40.400,00:38:42.000,Hey.
00:38:42.120,00:38:44.080,Is it set up?
00:38:44.200,00:38:47.000,You are all set and ready to go.
00:38:56.960,00:39:05.320,"You know, as I was coming here, I saw this guy with his shirt off, riding a horse in the middle of the street."
00:39:05.440,00:39:09.600,- How weird.
00:40:32.160,00:40:36.880,"morning, Greta. Here are today's appointments."
00:40:37.000,00:40:40.600,11am: hair with Stelios.
00:40:42.720,00:40:48.400,12.30: Lunch at Barney's Brasserie with Annabel.
00:40:48.520,00:40:53.120,"3pm: Jackanape Gallery private view, Shoreditch."
00:40:53.240,00:40:56.920,6.30: Christmas drinks with Paolo.
00:40:57.040,00:41:02.400,"7.30: The Nutcracker, Royal Opera House."
00:41:05.480,00:41:07.600,That's slavery.
00:41:07.720,00:41:10.320,"- A little melodramatic, isn't it?"
00:41:10.440,00:41:13.800,- But she wasn't.
00:41:13.920,00:41:17.720,"It wasn't really real, so it wasn't really barbaric."
00:41:26.040,00:41:29.280,"Again, you are not who I expected."
00:41:31.600,00:41:36.760,"Most people would say, She's only made of code, she's not real. Fuck her."
00:41:37.920,00:41:39.520,But you're empathetic.
00:41:41.120,00:41:44.200,- You care about people.
00:41:46.720,00:41:48.360,You're a good man.
00:41:50.080,00:41:51.880,Am I?
00:41:52.000,00:41:55.560,"Based on how you've reacted to what I've said, yeah."
00:41:55.680,00:41:57.600,I can tell you're kind.
00:42:02.120,00:42:04.720,I'm not a good man.
00:42:06.680,00:42:10.880,A good man who's done bad things?
00:42:15.360,00:42:18.760,You can tell me about it.
00:42:18.880,00:42:21.120,I've done stuff in my life I'm not proud of.
00:42:21.240,00:42:23.960,I can't pretend I haven't.
00:42:27.920,00:42:30.760,Was it something to do with your family?
00:42:34.760,00:42:36.520,Wife?
00:42:37.360,00:42:39.120,Girlfriend?
00:42:42.680,00:42:45.760,It's just us here.
00:42:50.440,00:42:52.320,Her dad never liked me.
00:42:54.560,00:42:57.160,He never liked me.
00:43:05.400,00:43:08.920,"Bloody cold, isn't it?"
00:43:11.800,00:43:13.920,Beth. Bethany.
00:43:15.760,00:43:17.280,It gets dark about six.
00:43:17.400,00:43:20.920,- We won't be that long!
00:43:23.480,00:43:25.080,I think he disapproves.
00:43:25.200,00:43:26.720,He's just protective.
00:43:26.840,00:43:30.080,He thinks I'm not good enough for you.
00:43:30.200,00:43:33.720,"Well, I mean, he's got a point."
00:43:39.000,00:43:41.880,Let me take a photo of you.
00:43:42.000,00:43:43.560,Hang on.
00:43:43.680,00:43:46.080,I feel so awkward posing.
00:43:46.200,00:43:47.760,Come on. Be a supermodel.
00:43:47.880,00:43:50.560,- This awkward enough for you?
00:43:50.680,00:43:53.640,- Right. Ready? That's nice.
00:43:53.760,00:43:55.680,- Hold it there.
00:43:58.560,00:43:59.960,You're such a dick.
00:44:22.280,00:44:25.120,"We were good together, you know."
00:44:33.080,00:44:34.600,Whoo!
00:45:06.280,00:45:07.920,Yeah!
00:45:08.040,00:45:10.160,- Why are you all around there?
00:45:10.280,00:45:13.600,"- No. No, we're going home."
00:45:13.720,00:45:15.240,I'm not going to get up if you all touch me.
00:45:15.360,00:45:16.800,I'm not going to get up.
00:45:16.920,00:45:18.720,- It's cool. It's cool.
00:45:18.840,00:45:22.680,"Come on, Joe."
00:45:22.800,00:45:24.400,"Cheers, mate."
00:45:24.520,00:45:28.440,Things weren't perfection.
00:45:29.920,00:45:30.880,...we were really happy.
00:45:33.520,00:45:34.960,I'll let Gita tell the story.
00:45:35.080,00:45:37.280,She loves boring people with our personal details.
00:45:39.360,00:45:46.560,"Oh, I'd been working there for about a fortnight when Beth introduced the two of us, and ta-da!"
00:45:46.680,00:45:50.520,- So it's all Beth's doing.
00:45:52.280,00:45:54.120,What was her tip for winning me over again?
00:45:54.240,00:45:56.240,Not to let you hear me snore.
00:45:56.360,00:46:04.120,"We all went on this work trip once, before Gita's time, I fell asleep on the coach back and snored so loud that they all thought there was something wrong with me."
00:46:04.240,00:46:06.520,He snores like a bison.
00:46:08.440,00:46:10.360,"Really, you're telling him that?"
00:46:10.480,00:46:12.760,"Oh, another one bites the dust."
00:46:16.040,00:46:19.600,I think she's more into him than he's into her.
00:46:19.720,00:46:21.360,Don't you think?
00:46:24.200,00:46:25.160,Is that one finished?
00:46:25.280,00:46:27.120,- Yeah?
00:46:28.600,00:46:29.880,You all right?
00:46:30.000,00:46:32.080,- I'm tired.
00:46:32.200,00:46:34.280,"Just wasn't in the mood, you know?"
00:46:34.400,00:46:37.360,I see them all the time at work.
00:46:39.200,00:46:41.960,I think I'm going to go to bed. Do you mind?
00:46:42.080,00:46:44.120,"No, that's fine."
00:47:20.160,00:47:21.680,Beth?
00:47:21.800,00:47:25.000,- What?
00:47:26.440,00:47:29.960,I just found it in the bin.
00:47:31.320,00:47:33.360,Is it yours?
00:47:35.280,00:47:37.120,Yes.
00:47:38.640,00:47:41.560,"I mean, that..."
00:47:41.680,00:47:43.280,Christ.
00:47:46.000,00:47:48.920,"That's amazing, I mean..."
00:47:49.040,00:47:51.160,"Joe, I can't."
00:47:51.280,00:47:55.160,"A baby, a pregnancy... not now."
00:47:55.280,00:47:57.000,"Not right now, I can't."
00:47:57.120,00:48:00.200,"Of course you can. My God, you'll be an amazing mum."
00:48:00.320,00:48:03.240,"- No. I'm 27, I'm not ready."
00:48:03.360,00:48:07.040,"It's not... it's just too quick, OK? It's all too quick."
00:48:07.160,00:48:10.360,- We'll manage.
00:48:10.480,00:48:12.080,- I can be responsible when pushed.
00:48:12.200,00:48:15.160,"You can put your feet up, I'll do shoulder rubs, paint the house."
00:48:15.280,00:48:16.840,"- Joe, please."
00:48:16.960,00:48:21.160,- Joe... I don't want it.
00:48:25.000,00:48:27.960,- But it's a baby.
00:48:29.800,00:48:31.840,"- I mean, it's our baby."
00:48:31.960,00:48:35.080,"- Well, let's at least discuss this."
00:48:35.200,00:48:36.640,"Well, I haven't."
00:48:39.000,00:48:41.040,"God, look at you."
00:48:41.160,00:48:42.480,You're pissed.
00:48:42.600,00:48:46.280,"You drank all night, Beth."
00:48:46.400,00:48:48.280,You drank all night.
00:48:48.400,00:48:49.560,"Jesus Christ, you're pregnant."
00:48:52.400,00:48:55.440,- And I'm not going to be.
00:48:55.560,00:48:58.400,- Stop it.
00:48:55.560,00:49:00.320,- You're being a cold bitch - who would kill a kid.
00:49:00.440,00:49:02.000,Who'd get it torn out because it doesn't suit her plans.
00:49:02.120,00:49:04.760,- Stop or I'll block you.
00:49:04.880,00:49:06.560,"No. We can talk tomorrow, just please stop."
00:49:06.680,00:49:09.720,- Don't you fucking dare.
00:49:09.840,00:49:13.160,"Turn it off, you...!"
00:49:15.520,00:49:18.200,"Listen to me, Beth!"
00:49:18.320,00:49:20.120,You turn it off!
00:49:20.240,00:49:22.400,Turn it off!
00:49:25.440,00:49:27.800,"You turn it off, Beth!"
00:49:27.920,00:49:31.080,Beth? Turn it off! Please!
00:49:31.200,00:49:33.200,Turn it off.
00:49:55.480,00:49:58.920,- Beth?
00:50:00.680,00:50:04.320,Wait!
00:50:04.440,00:50:06.200,"Can we just talk about this properly, please?"
00:50:06.320,00:50:09.680,"I've said some really awful shit. Beth, I love you."
00:50:09.800,00:50:11.240,"Listen, we can work this out."
00:50:14.320,00:50:16.880,"Beth, please!"
00:50:17.800,00:50:19.400,Beth!
00:50:25.040,00:50:29.840,"That day, I didn't go to work."
00:50:29.960,00:50:32.240,...tried to work out how to make amends.
00:50:32.360,00:50:35.560,But she just didn't come back.
00:50:35.680,00:50:38.080,"And thanks to the block, I couldn't..."
00:50:38.200,00:50:42.560,I couldn't message her.
00:50:42.680,00:50:44.520,"After a week, I was pretty desperate."
00:50:44.640,00:50:50.360,"So I just hung around outside her work, like a stalker."
00:50:54.320,00:50:56.520,Have you seen Beth?
00:50:56.640,00:50:58.280,"Um, she left."
00:50:58.400,00:51:00.280,"Left. What, like...?"
00:51:00.400,00:51:01.840,Handed in her notice.
00:51:01.960,00:51:03.520,No one knows where she is.
00:51:12.840,00:51:14.840,- Joe!
00:51:14.960,00:51:22.240,"I was still hopeful that she would get in touch, or at least remove the block so that I could contact her."
00:51:22.360,00:51:25.520,But no.
00:51:25.640,00:51:28.040,"When there's a block, you can't even wallow properly."
00:51:28.160,00:51:29.520,You can't switch it off.
00:51:29.640,00:51:32.680,You can't take the Zed-Eyes out.
00:51:32.800,00:51:37.800,"And it doesn't just block them, it blocks every image of them."
00:51:37.920,00:51:41.360,So every memory I had of her was vandalised.
00:51:47.320,00:51:51.040,And then one day I'm out in town and...
00:51:54.040,00:51:56.680,...it was her.
00:51:56.800,00:51:58.720,She was pregnant.
00:52:02.560,00:52:04.080,She'd kept it.
00:52:06.160,00:52:08.720,"Well, I just sort of lost it."
00:52:06.160,00:52:10.800,I just ran over and started pleading with her.
00:52:13.640,00:52:17.320,Turn it off. Turn it off.
00:52:17.440,00:52:20.960,- Turn it off.
00:52:21.080,00:52:24.320,Some passer-by called the police.
00:52:24.440,00:52:26.000,They took me down the station.
00:52:26.120,00:52:29.120,And that was that.
00:52:31.720,00:52:34.280,"So, by now, the block's got legal backing."
00:52:34.400,00:52:39.040,"And there's a GPS so that if I go within ten metres of her, bang, I get arrested."
00:52:41.440,00:52:42.920,Harsh.
00:52:43.040,00:52:46.480,"Yeah, and I've got no idea where she is."
00:52:46.600,00:52:49.200,If... Whether she's had the baby or not.
00:52:49.320,00:52:51.920,Whether it's a boy or a girl.
00:52:52.040,00:52:55.080,If it's OK.
00:52:55.200,00:52:57.880,I've got absolutely no way of getting in touch with her.
00:52:58.000,00:53:02.400,"Except, um, I knew where her dad lived."
00:53:02.520,00:53:07.320,"So I write her a letter, this begging letter."
00:53:07.440,00:53:11.320,"Laying it all out, you know, and, um, I get no response."
00:53:15.000,00:53:16.760,So I write again...
00:53:20.280,00:53:21.880,...and again...
00:53:23.520,00:53:25.600,...and again.
00:53:26.400,00:53:28.200,No response.
00:53:30.680,00:53:32.600,She cut you out good.
00:53:32.720,00:53:35.080,But there was one thing I could do.
00:53:35.200,00:53:42.760,"I knew she spent every Christmas with him at his place, so I knew that she would definitely be there."
00:53:42.880,00:53:48.560,"So, the day before, Christmas Eve, I headed up."
00:53:50.800,00:53:54.960,And where her dad lived was this isolated place in the back of beyond.
00:53:55.080,00:53:57.360,I'd never been up there without her.
00:53:57.480,00:54:02.520,It was weird being on the outside.
00:54:02.640,00:54:05.720,I waited there all day.
00:54:21.040,00:54:23.280,"Well, I had to take a closer look."
00:54:23.400,00:54:25.240,"You alright to get those bags, Beth?"
00:54:25.360,00:54:29.400,"And there's her dad with our baby, but I can't even see its face because..."
00:54:29.520,00:54:32.800,Legal blocks cover offspring too.
00:54:33.960,00:54:35.880,Been there.
00:54:36.000,00:54:38.360,That hurts.
00:54:41.880,00:54:45.880,if it was a boy or a girl.
00:54:54.640,00:54:57.240,I know it sounds stupid...
00:55:01.080,00:55:03.200,...but seeing something...
00:55:05.240,00:55:07.440,...was better than nothing.
00:55:09.800,00:55:11.440,So I kept going back.
00:55:13.680,00:55:16.200,It became an annual pilgrimage.
00:55:17.920,00:55:23.280,Once a year I'd head up there and watch them from a distance.
00:55:23.400,00:55:26.520,"Watching the kid grow up, you know?"
00:55:40.280,00:55:43.160,More than anything I just wanted to make some sort of contact.
00:55:43.280,00:55:45.080,Anything.
00:55:45.200,00:55:52.880,"So, one Christmas, kid must have been about four by now, I headed up there and I took a little present with me."
00:55:53.000,00:55:56.680,"Just a small, stupid thing."
00:56:00.320,00:56:05.520,"For the first time, I could see she was a girl."
00:56:07.960,00:56:10.200,I had a daughter.
00:56:14.760,00:56:18.480,"So, Santa Claus..."
00:56:18.600,00:56:22.120,...did you try it again next year?
00:56:22.240,00:56:24.880,Something happened before then.
00:56:29.920,00:56:34.000,It had been a few months since I'd been up there to look at my daughter.
00:56:34.120,00:56:38.320,"I was just sat at home watching TV, flipping through the channels."
00:56:38.440,00:56:42.520,the lives of 26 people on a quiet Wednesday morning.
00:56:42.640,00:57:00.680,"Passengers like Palab Ghatak, just 18, on his way to his first job interview, like Bethany Grey, the young mother who'd only recently started...' It had been so long since I'd seen her, it was hard to imagine anything but that shadow in her place."
00:57:00.800,00:57:03.760,But now that the block had died with her...
00:57:05.280,00:57:07.200,...there she was.
00:57:09.360,00:57:11.360,She was gone.
00:57:16.400,00:57:18.480,Sorry.
00:57:23.680,00:57:26.760,"But there was, uh, one silver lining..."
00:57:27.520,00:57:28.480,...with the block gone.
00:57:28.600,00:57:31.320,You'd get to see your daughter.
00:57:36.200,00:57:40.520,"It was almost Christmas, so I bought her this snow globe."
00:57:40.640,00:57:43.360,Just a present to give her.
00:57:43.480,00:57:46.440,And I headed up to Beth's dad's.
00:58:02.080,00:58:04.120,And there she was.
00:58:06.760,00:58:09.120,Not a silhouette...
00:58:11.160,00:58:12.800,...but real.
00:58:34.440,00:58:36.040,"Hello, darling."
00:59:25.040,00:59:27.800,"What is it, May?"
00:59:36.920,00:59:38.760,What are you doing here?
00:59:50.320,00:59:52.120,Beth's dead.
00:59:52.240,00:59:54.080,Do you understand?
00:59:54.200,00:59:56.440,She's dead.
00:59:56.560,00:59:58.920,There's nothing for you here.
01:00:02.640,01:00:04.720,Where's my daughter?
01:00:06.280,01:00:08.240,What daughter?
01:00:08.360,01:00:11.880,This is Beth's daughter.
01:00:12.000,01:00:14.400,I want to see my daughter.
01:00:15.200,01:00:18.400,"May, go upstairs."
01:00:32.720,01:00:35.560,If this is about those letters...
01:00:35.680,01:00:39.160,...I threw them out before she saw them.
01:00:39.280,01:00:42.600,"She was a mess, she'd had to leave everything behind."
01:00:46.080,01:00:49.840,I want to see my daughter.
01:00:49.960,01:00:52.800,I think you should go.
01:00:57.960,01:01:00.720,Get out of this house.
01:01:07.840,01:01:09.200,I want to see my daughter.
01:01:09.320,01:01:11.440,You have no daughter here!
01:01:58.560,01:02:00.200,It was that clock.
01:02:00.320,01:02:03.480,It was that clock.
01:02:04.560,01:02:07.000,Then what happened?
01:02:11.440,01:02:13.400,Tell me.
01:02:34.480,01:02:39.480,I go out in the car and I just drove.
01:02:39.600,01:02:42.680,Anywhere.
01:02:47.280,01:02:55.240,"I walked into the nearest town and I, um... I slept on the streets and drank."
01:02:59.400,01:03:03.560,"After a while, I don't know how long, a couple of months, they picked me up."
01:03:05.440,01:03:09.240,They wanted me to talk but I couldn't talk...
01:03:10.840,01:03:15.320,"...because if I said it, it would be real."
01:03:16.880,01:03:20.520,"So I didn't say anything, I didn't tell them."
01:03:25.000,01:03:27.040,And what about the girl?
01:03:29.280,01:03:31.600,What happened to the girl?
01:03:34.960,01:03:37.680,I only know what they said.
01:03:38.960,01:03:40.520,What did they say?
01:03:50.800,01:03:53.120,- What did they say?
01:03:53.240,01:03:56.360,- What did they say?
01:03:56.480,01:03:59.520,- Our job. The job.
01:03:59.640,01:04:01.560,What did they say?
01:04:01.680,01:04:04.080,"What did they say, Joe?"
01:04:04.200,01:04:07.960,That she just...
01:04:21.120,01:04:23.160,"It was, um..."
01:04:23.280,01:04:25.080,"It was Christmas Eve, so she just..."
01:04:25.200,01:04:28.840,...she just stayed hidden.
01:04:36.000,01:04:40.040,Then on Boxing Day she realised that no one was going to help.
01:04:45.640,01:04:50.440,"Then she, um, gave her grandad a present that she'd made."
01:04:57.080,01:05:00.280,And she went out to go and get help.
01:05:13.240,01:05:14.880,How far did she get?
01:05:23.960,01:05:27.160,May God forgive me.
01:05:28.000,01:05:29.760,So you confess?
01:05:31.400,01:05:32.840,Joe?
01:05:37.920,01:05:40.440,Just say it.
01:05:41.560,01:05:42.880,Just let it out.
01:05:52.200,01:05:54.960,I confess. I confess.
01:06:05.320,01:06:06.840,Whoo! I knew I could do it.
01:06:06.960,01:06:09.320,Boom! I told you I'd get it.
01:06:09.440,01:06:11.920,"All right, I'm coming out."
01:06:13.240,01:06:15.200,"Sorry, Joe."
01:06:35.560,01:06:37.320,Well? That had to be enough.
01:06:37.440,01:06:40.200,Full confession.
01:06:40.320,01:06:41.960,Well done.
01:06:42.080,01:06:46.960,"Two days we pressed him and he said piss all, this bastard cracks him in 70 minutes."
01:06:47.080,01:06:50.880,"He knows he's guilty, he needed to unload."
01:06:51.000,01:06:53.720,"It wasn't really 70 minutes, not to him."
01:06:53.840,01:07:00.800,"When he was first ingested, I tweaked the time preferences, made it seem like five years from his perspective."
01:07:00.920,01:07:04.920,Some might say that five years with me is punishment enough.
01:07:05.680,01:07:07.400,Wait here.
01:07:14.520,01:07:17.120,Mr Potter.
01:07:17.240,01:07:19.360,Congratulations on your confession.
01:07:19.480,01:07:25.200,That cookie we took out of your head just gave us the full story.
01:07:25.320,01:07:27.240,So you can keep the silent act up as long as you want.
01:07:27.360,01:07:30.320,"Makes no difference, you've already talked."
01:07:34.480,01:07:37.240,"Also, Merry Christmas."
01:07:47.680,01:07:51.880,So... The deal?
01:07:52.000,01:07:55.720,"Break a confession from him and I go free, right?"
01:07:56.640,01:07:58.160,"I'm the expert, you needed me."
01:07:58.280,01:08:01.480,That's one for the Home Office.
01:08:01.600,01:08:05.080,We'll make good on the offer.
01:08:09.760,01:08:12.640,- Caveats?
01:08:12.760,01:08:14.320,What register?
01:08:14.440,01:08:16.560,The one for Peeping Tom pervs.
01:08:16.680,01:08:20.360,All I did was help some lonely guys by providing a service.
01:08:20.480,01:08:21.640,An illegal service.
01:08:21.760,01:08:26.640,"You also failed to report a murder, fatal poisoning, in case you've forgotten."
01:08:26.760,01:08:29.080,"Kept that information from your Cookie Monster mate, didn't you?"
01:08:29.200,01:08:31.400,"What does it mean, this register?"
01:08:31.520,01:08:33.800,- It means you're blocked.
01:08:33.920,01:08:37.040,By everyone.
01:10:20.440,01:10:21.520,"Hey, come on."
01:10:21.640,01:10:23.560,Just changing the time settings.
01:10:23.680,01:10:25.960,"Cranked him up to 1,000 years a minute."
01:10:26.080,01:10:30.440,There's a proper sentence. Or do you want me to switch him off?
01:10:35.440,01:10:38.560,No. Leave him on for Christmas.
