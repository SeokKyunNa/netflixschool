Well. I mean, traditionally,
science fairs are a father/son thing.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:22.940  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

traditions are an idiot thing.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.946  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

for Pluto?, and then Jupiter--

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:32.087  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Of course Pluto's a planet, son.
I learned that in the third grade.

I just googled it.
Pluto's not a planet,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.392  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
they changed it in 2006.

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:49.229  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, I heard about that, Morty.
And I disagree.

61
00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:50.522  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:53.817  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's right. It's possible
to disagree in science, Morty.

63
00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.737  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.448  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I disagree back.
Give me a ping pong ball.

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.782  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.617  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Go find Rick
and go over my head about Pluto?

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:06.204  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Hey, Morty, let me [burps]
ask you a question real quick.

70
00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:19.468  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Does evil exist, and if so,
can one detect and measure it?

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:23.972  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Rhetorical question, Morty, the answer's
yes, you just have to be a genius.

72
00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.349  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Cute. Your sister's boss
gave me a microscope

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.769  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-that would've made me retarded.
-Oh, boy, Rick,

74
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.812  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't think you're allowed
to say that word, you know.

75
00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:33.190  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Morty, I'm not disparaging
the differently abled.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.859  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm stating the fact
that if I had used this microscope,

77
00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.569  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
it would've made me mentally retarded.

78
00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.654  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, yeah, but I don't think
it's about logic, Rick.

79
00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:42.365  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think the word has just become
a symbolic issue for powerful groups

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.242  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

they're doing the right thing.

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:45.535  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

if Pluto's a planet, didn't you?

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:50.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

I don't care what anyone says.
If it can be a planet,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.963  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
it can be a planet again.

who's making headlines with his bold
announcement that is what, Jerry?

199
00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.566  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Pluto is a planet.
-Wow.

200
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.485  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Well, how about that.
-I love it.

201
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:57.031  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Morty Smith? I'm Scroopy Noopers.
I'm a scientist. Can I show you something?

202
00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:59.492  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I better not.
-Right now.

203
00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:06.833  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The center of Pluto, Mister Smith,
is made of a substance called Plutonium.

204
00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:10.128  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mines like these suck Plutonium
up to the cities,

205
00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:13.131  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
where corporations use it
to power everything,

206
00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:16.217  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
from diamond cars to golden showers

207
00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:19.304  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and the more we remove,
the more Pluto shrinks.

208
00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:20.597  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[rumbling sound]

209
00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:22.473  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There it goes again.
It just shrank a little.

210
00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:27.061  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But a few years ago, your scientists
noticed Pluto had gotten so small

211
00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:30.815  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
they couldn't call it a planet anymore.
It should have been our wake up call.

212
00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:33.443  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But the rich Plutonians won't wake up.

213
00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.446  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And they love your dad
telling everyone Pluto's a planet,

214
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:40.033  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because that means they can keep mining,
until Pluto goes from planet

215
00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:44.579  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
to asteroid, to meteor
and finally... poof.

216
00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:46.705  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
A party?

217
00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.793  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Is everyone in your family an idiot?
-For sure me and my dad are!

218
00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:53.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, all you have to do
is get him to admit that

219
00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.674  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and you could save four billion lives.

220
00:11:56.758 --> 00:12:00.929  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, you know, the thing is,
my dad's really insecure.

221
00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:07.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Funny. Mister Needful,
out of everything in the store

222
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:10.021  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you'll never guess
what we couldn't get rid of.

223
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.608  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

224
00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:16.611  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

225
00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:18.696  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I wish this desk was lighter.

226
00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:23.660  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I wish this knot was looser!

227
00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Come on.

228
00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.043  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wait, what am I doing?

229
00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.212  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I wish I knew CPR!

230
00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:37.507  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
One, two, three.

231
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.467  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Jesus, what a waste of a monkey paw.

232
00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:43.471  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mr. Needful, how could you even think
of doing something so horrible?

233
00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:47.016  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm the Devil, what should I do
when I fail, give myself an ice cream?

234
00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.393  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You haven't failed!

235
00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.979  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
People like Rick
are making me obsolete.

236
00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:54.941  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, seriously, I may be the Devil,
but your grandpa is <i>the</i> Devil.

237
00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:58.403  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just want to go back to Hell, where
everyone thinks I'm smart and funny.

238
00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.196  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No!
It's not fair.

239
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.324  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Everyone in this town got something
they wanted from you. Even Rick.

240
00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.536  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I was your only friend, and I get nothing?

241
00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:09.455  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, I'll give you one thing.
Name it.

242
00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.790  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I want to help you.

243
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.461  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Clever twist.
-I learned from the best, you old fart.

244
00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.130  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now let's go get you hydrated.

245
00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:20.383  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Looks like we've got
haunted boxing gloves

246
00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:23.886  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
that will make you
the heavyweight champion in 1936,

247
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.805  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and then you'll be trapped there,
winning the same fight for eternity.

248
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.267  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I can take out the eternity
and the padding

249
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.394  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and then you'll have
some time traveling mittens.

250
00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:34.689  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby.
How's business?

251
00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:36.524  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Here's the last of our inventory.

252
00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:39.527  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We're going to file chapter 11
and do some restructuring.

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:41.487  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.448  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That was important to you, wasn't it?

255
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.950  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Nope. It was important
to your dumb devil friend.

256
00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:47.410  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
To me this was all just a bit like

257
00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.620  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Holy crap. Holy crap.

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:59.005  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But you know what, Grandpa Rick? He's
strong and he's never going to give up.

00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:03.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:32.705  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
