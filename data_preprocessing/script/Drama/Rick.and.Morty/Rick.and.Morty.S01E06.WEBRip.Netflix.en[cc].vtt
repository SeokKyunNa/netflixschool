Wow, Rick, I gotta say. You really
pulled a rabbit out your hat this time.

I thought the whole place was gonna be
messed up for good, but here you did it!

You figured out that crazy solution

C'mon, luck had nothing to do with it.
I'm great, that's the real reason.

Now, Morty,
will you hand me a screwdriver

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.215  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Sure thing, Rick.
Here's a screwdriver.

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:35.596  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Alright, thank you very much.
I got one screw turn.

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:38.349  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

[terrified] Oh my God, Rick, is that us?
We're dead!

Shut up and listen to me!
It's fine! Everything is fine!

There's an infinite number of realities.

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:10.047  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And in a few dozen of those,
I turned everything back to normal.

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:14.093  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just had to find one in which we also
happened to both die around this time.

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:18.681  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now we can just slip into the place
of our dead selves in this reality.

319
00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:21.475  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We're not skipping a beat.
Help me with these bodies.

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.979  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, OK?

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:28.190  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That seems fair to me, that seems
like a fair way to divvy it up.

323
00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:30.693  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Rick! What about the reality
we left behind?

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:33.112  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What about the reality
where Hitler cured cancer?

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:34.905  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Don't think about it.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:38.534  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's not like we can do this every week.
We get three or four more of these, tops.

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:42.079  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now pick up your dead self and come on.
Haste makes waste.

I don't suppose you've considered this,

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.167  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but if I hadn't screwed up
as much as I did,

330
00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:49.712  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we'd be these guys right now.
So, again, you're welcome.

the blood and the red and the water...

what happened to Rick and Morty?

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:08.684  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because everyone was Cronenberged
all along like us from the beginning.

00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:16.317  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
