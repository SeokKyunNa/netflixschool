Look, I'm not paying 70 [burps] smidgens
for a [burps] broken defraculator.

00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:13.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That is multiphase quantum resonator.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.516  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Well does it defraculate?
-Fuck no.

4
00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.351  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then it's a broken defraculator.

5
00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:19.811  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

about fraculation.

[shop owner] Your planet just got
cell phones and the coverage still sucks.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.986  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, let's say 60 smidgens
and I'll tell you what,

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:34.326  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hey, Rick, you think maybe
I could get something from this place?

11
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.788  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Like a souvenir? Like just to have,
like something cool, you know?

12
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Not here, Morty,
we'll stop somewhere else,

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:41.792  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because, you know, there's always
another pawn shop.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.043  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.172  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you know, I thought that robot
over there looked pretty cool, you know.

16
00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, it "looks cool", huh?
That's why you want it?

17
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.844  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, you know, I mean, it's different
from the stuff on Earth,

18
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

all these crazy places across the galaxy

00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:00.394  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and, you know, I don't really have
anything to remember all those trips by.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:03.397  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It'd be kind of cool,
like a souvenir, you know?

21
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.732  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Like what if you passed away
or died or something?

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.361  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I wouldn't even have anything
to remember all the cool stuff we did.

23
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.782  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
OK. [burps] Sixty for the resonator

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.657  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
So we're just going to pretend
this isn't happening?

27
00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.076  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'm not saying that's a bad idea,
just asking.

28
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.996  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Rick, why would you let Morty bring
that thing into our house?

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:05.751  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
What do you want from me? He thought
it looked cool. You know what I mean?

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:14.676  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:21.933  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Intervening with puberty?

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:24.936  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
You'll turn him into Ralph Fiennes
in <i>Red Dragon.</i>

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.481  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

set the bar that low?

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:34.363  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:38.533  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, <i>now</i> if we hear squeaking,
we intervene.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.247  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That is Gwendolyn, I mean the robot.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.792  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:51.338  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know what I'm talking about, Morty?
[gibberish]

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:52.547  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Morty, that's my catch phrase, remember?

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.928  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Remember
how I cemented that catch phrase?

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:01.264  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Alright, alright, seriously though,
let me grab this thing.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:15.570  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think Morty's robot was designed
for more than long weekends.

53
00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:21.827  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Yep, this here's some kind of baby maker.

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:25.497  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And that there's half Morty,
half [burps] who-knows-what.

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.666  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's my bad, guys,
I'll take care of it.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.591  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean this thing could grow
to the size of Delaware.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.594  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, it might eat brains
and exhale space AIDS.

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:40.554  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

I'm a father now.

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.976  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know.
It's time for me to be responsible.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.937  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Isn't that right, Morty Junior?
-Don't name it. Crap, he named it.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.190  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, dad, it's a living thing.
And it's half-human.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Jerry, majoring in civics was your
mistake, don't punish us for it.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.615  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Fine, I'm gonna take
this thing to my workshop

70
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:01.992  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and do a little bit of investigating.

71
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.536  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Do not let that thing
out of your sight.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.038  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It looks harmless now, but it could grow
into something dangerous.

into a monster, do you?

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.093  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

one of Morty's loads.

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:44.326  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But maybe I can find suitable parents for
Morty Junior on this robot's home world,

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.457  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
which is... Gazorpazorp

Don't you need a new companion
now that Morty's in the family way?

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:01.384  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
that would make me better
at walking through a hole? [screams]

We're here because a male Gazorpian

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.786  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

It's not dominated by us, okay?
On Earth, men and women are equals.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.234  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.110  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, but you can't go

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:05.535  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You are hereby sentenced

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.752  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.380  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:18.923  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:28.807 --> 00:13:32.312  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:19.567  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

An Earth man made this top.

Maybe on your planet, separation

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:37.126  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:40.046  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
which is why my clothes

It's true. And sometimes
the truth hurts, but it must be accepted.

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:50.765  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:55.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
