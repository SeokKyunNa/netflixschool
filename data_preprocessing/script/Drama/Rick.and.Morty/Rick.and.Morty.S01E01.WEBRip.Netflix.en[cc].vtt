00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:38.304  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.361  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.948  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's ways to get back home, but
it's gonna be a little bit of a hassle.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:08.246  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So you're gonna have to do me
a real solid. When we get to customs,

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.418  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:18.797  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, geez, I really don't want
to have to do that.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.217  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:25.138  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They aren't gonna get through customs
unless they're in someone's rectum.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:28.433  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
