00:00:13.972,00:00:16.683,"I got a surprise for you. Hurry up, gotta go."
00:00:16.808,00:00:19.561,Ow! You're tugging me too hard!
00:00:22.314,00:00:25.692,"What do you think of this flying vehicle, Morty?"
00:00:25.817,00:00:27.694,I built it out of stuff I found in the garage.
00:00:27.778,00:00:30.239,It's great. Is this the surprise?
00:00:30.364,00:00:32.991,"Morty, I had to... I had to do..."
00:00:33.116,00:00:40.832,"I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb-- We're going to drop it down there, it's going to get a whole fresh start."
00:00:40.958,00:00:44.920,"-That's absolutely crazy! -Just take it easy, it's gonna be good."
00:00:45.003,00:00:47.381,We're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.
00:00:47.464,00:00:49.048,Jessica? From my math class?
00:00:49.174,00:00:51.969,"When I drop the bomb, I don't... you know..."
00:00:52.094,00:00:54.680,"I want you to have somebody, to have a thing."
00:00:54.763,00:00:57.558,I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve and you're gonna be Adam.
00:00:57.641,00:00:59.601,-Huh? -And Jessica's gonna be Eve.
00:00:59.726,00:01:01.728,-That's the surprise. -No you can't!
00:01:01.853,00:01:03.647,Jessica doesn't even know I exist!
00:01:03.730,00:01:06.608,"But forget about that, you can't blow up humanity!"
00:01:06.733,00:01:13.949,"I get what you're trying to say. You don't gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica, or mess around with her."
00:01:14.032,00:01:15.450,I'm not that kind of guy.
00:01:15.534,00:01:16.868,What are you talking about?
00:01:16.952,00:01:19.788,Don't worry about me getting with Jessica or anything.
00:01:19.913,00:01:21.915,"She's all for you, Morty."
00:01:24.585,00:01:28.171,"You're right. Let's forget her, she's probably nothing but trouble."
00:01:30.007,00:01:32.676,-That's it! I'm taking the wheel! -Get off of me!
00:01:32.801,00:01:36.597,-I'm taking charge of this situation! -What's gotten into you?
00:01:36.722,00:01:39.933,"-If you love Earth so much, marry it. -I'm not gonna let you..."
00:01:40.058,00:01:42.436,-What are you crazy? -...blow up the whole world!
00:01:42.561,00:01:47.316,"All right, Morty. I'll land the thing, I'll land the thing."
00:01:47.399,00:01:48.734,Big tough guy all of the sudden.
00:01:52.738,00:01:54.948,"Just park it here, side of the reroad here."
00:01:55.073,00:01:56.074,"Oh, thank God!"
00:01:56.199,00:01:59.161,"You know what? That was all a test, Morty."
00:01:59.286,00:02:02.247,Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.
00:02:02.372,00:02:04.666,"-It was? -Sure. Why not, I don't know."
00:02:09.254,00:02:10.589,Bomb?
00:02:45.540,00:02:48.710,I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight.
00:02:48.835,00:02:51.797,Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer?
00:02:51.880,00:02:53.757,"Oh my God, his head is in his food, I'm gonna puke."
00:02:53.882,00:02:55.467,Are you getting sick?
00:02:55.550,00:02:58.887,"I told you not to practice-kiss the living room pillow, the dog sleeps on it."
00:02:58.970,00:03:03.308,"I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night."
00:03:03.392,00:03:05.560,Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.
00:03:05.686,00:03:08.187,Or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa Rick.
00:03:08.313,00:03:09.147,Dad?
00:03:09.231,00:03:11.316,"Everyone's supposed to sleep every single night, now?"
00:03:11.441,00:03:13.610,You realize that time makes up half of all time?
00:03:17.364,00:03:18.907,"There is no God, Summer."
00:03:18.990,00:03:21.200,"Rip that band-aid off now, you'll thank me later."
00:03:21.284,00:03:24.871,"With all due respect, Rick... What am I talking about? What respect is due?"
00:03:24.996,00:03:30.961,How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for highconcept sci-fi rigmarole?
00:03:31.086,00:03:33.839,"Jerry, I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything."
00:03:33.964,00:03:39.970,"It's your house, your world, you're a real Julius Caesar But I'll tell you how I feel about school. It's a waste of time."
00:03:40.095,00:03:42.723,"Bunch of people running around, bumping into each other."
00:03:42.848,00:03:51.732,"Guy up front says two plus two, the people in the back say four, then the bell rings, they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump."
00:03:51.857,00:03:58.363,"It's not a place for smart people, Jerry. I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue."
00:03:58.488,00:04:00.240,"This was a good breakfast, Beth."
00:04:00.323,00:04:02.492,You really made the crap out of those eggs.
00:04:02.617,00:04:04.870,I wish your mother was here to eat them.
00:04:12.419,00:04:15.547,We're going to be dealing with some real serious stuff today.
00:04:15.630,00:04:17.799,"You might have heard of it, it's called math?"
00:04:17.883,00:04:21.803,"Without it, none of us would even exist. So let's jump right in. Two plus two?"
00:04:25.891,00:04:28.059,"Okay, good. It's time for the quiz."
00:04:31.480,00:04:33.899,First row take one pass it back for me?
00:04:34.024,00:04:35.817,The stakes are high in this room.
00:04:39.196,00:04:42.657,"People getting smarter, some of y'all getting dumber..."
00:04:47.746,00:04:50.415,"-Hi, Jessica. -Can I show these to you?"
00:04:50.499,00:04:53.293,"Wow. They're both great, thank you."
00:04:53.418,00:04:55.837,You know what I named these? My little Morties.
00:04:55.921,00:04:58.590,That's flattering... and a little weird.
00:04:58.715,00:05:00.592,Do you know what I want you to do with them?
00:05:00.717,00:05:01.718,Rename them?
00:05:01.843,00:05:05.639,Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business.
00:05:05.764,00:05:10.560,"See if you can shuffle them, get in there and knock them around, no wrong answers."
00:05:10.685,00:05:14.397,"Wow, well, okay, Jessica. Let's give this a shot!"
00:05:18.693,00:05:20.737,"Uh, I'm just doing my best."
00:05:23.365,00:05:24.783,Morty!
00:05:24.908,00:05:26.535,Jessica...
00:05:26.660,00:05:29.412,Five more minutes of this and I'm gonna get mad.
00:05:29.496,00:05:30.747,Jessica...
00:05:31.748,00:05:33.625,It's not my fault this is happening.
00:05:36.086,00:05:37.671,"-Well, well, well. -Uh!"
00:05:37.796,00:05:40.465,"-Morning, Frank. -What's that supposed to mean?"
00:05:40.590,00:05:43.009,Are you making fun of me? Are you saying my family's poor?
00:05:43.134,00:05:48.014,"Geez, I don't know if a knife is necessary, you kind of had things handled without it."
00:05:48.098,00:05:52.394,"You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty."
00:05:58.066,00:06:05.949,"There you are, Morty. Listen, I've got an errand to run in a different dimension, -I need an extra pair of hands. -Geez, Rick, what'd you do to Frank?"
00:06:06.074,00:06:09.494,"It's pretty obvious, I froze him. Now listen: I need your help."
00:06:14.249,00:06:18.377,"-It's important. Come on, Morty. -I can't leave school again..."
00:06:18.503,00:06:21.131,Do you know how much higher the stakes get out there?
00:06:21.214,00:06:23.592,Do you think I can do it all by myself? Come on!
00:06:23.717,00:06:27.679,"Oh, geez, okay. I guess I can skip History. What about Frank?"
00:06:27.804,00:06:29.347,Shouldn't you unfreeze him?
00:06:29.431,00:06:32.601,"I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go."
00:06:38.607,00:06:41.776,This is the story we'll be telling our children.
00:06:41.902,00:06:43.236,"Hi, Frank."
00:06:50.035,00:06:51.494,-Scalpel. -Scalpel.
00:06:52.411,00:06:53.914,-Knock knock. -Jerry?
00:06:54.039,00:06:59.544,"My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought: Hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"
00:07:02.172,00:07:04.423,Please tell me you're here for an urgent reason.
00:07:04.507,00:07:06.259,"Well, it's lunch."
00:07:06.384,00:07:09.220,It's one of three meals that have existed for millennia.
00:07:11.097,00:07:16.394,"I only ask, Jerry, because as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery."
00:07:18.730,00:07:20.607,"Okay, let's not rehash that fight."
00:07:20.732,00:07:23.944,I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way.
00:07:24.069,00:07:25.987,"Whoa, what is this on the floor?"
00:07:26.112,00:07:29.699,Some kind of literature for a really nice looking nursing home.
00:07:29.824,00:07:34.996,"Hey, honey! Crazy idea? Bad pitch: Let's put your dad in a nursing home."
00:07:41.503,00:07:43.380,"There she is. Let's go, Morty."
00:07:43.505,00:07:44.881,"Oh, geez, okay."
00:07:46.967,00:07:49.803,"Oh man, Rick! What is this place?"
00:07:49.928,00:07:51.596,It's dimension 35C.
00:07:51.721,00:08:00.230,"And it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, called the mega tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and seeds in those fruits."
00:08:00.313,00:08:01.773,I'm talking about mega seeds.
00:08:10.323,00:08:14.035,"Alright, calm down. I know that new situations can be intimidating."
00:08:14.160,00:08:21.793,"You look around, and it's all scary and different, but meeting them head-on, charging right into them like a bull, that's how we grow as people."
00:08:21.876,00:08:24.879,I deal with scary situations all the time.
00:08:25.046,00:08:33.388,"If you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be-- Run! I've never seen that thing before. I don't know what the hell it is."
00:08:33.513,00:08:38.351,"We gotta get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die!"
00:08:40.729,00:08:45.608,"Take a deep breath, breathe that fresh air in. You smell that?"
00:08:45.775,00:08:47.360,That's the smell of adventure.
00:08:47.485,00:08:51.489,That's the smell of a whole different evolutionary timeline.
00:08:51.614,00:08:55.577,How much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?
00:08:55.744,00:08:59.205,Are you joking me? Look at all the crazy crap surrounding us.
00:08:59.330,00:09:00.623,Look at that thing right there.
00:09:00.749,00:09:02.125,What the hell is that thing?
00:09:02.208,00:09:06.379,You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school? Look at it!
00:09:06.504,00:09:08.715,"-It defies all logic. -Yeah, Rick, I get it."
00:09:08.840,00:09:10.842,We're surrounded by monsters.
00:09:10.925,00:09:13.094,That's kind of the reason why I wanna leave.
00:09:16.639,00:09:19.976,You see what we just stumbled upon? Any idea what that is down there?
00:09:20.060,00:09:23.813,"-The mega trees? -That's right, with the mega fruit on 'em!"
00:09:23.938,00:09:26.524,"That's what I'm talking about, that's where my seeds are."
00:09:26.649,00:09:32.322,"If we woulda done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, -because you're so in love with school. -All right."
00:09:32.447,00:09:34.449,What's so special about these seeds?
00:09:34.532,00:09:37.410,"You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic."
00:09:40.497,00:09:43.208,Just take these special grappling shoes.
00:09:43.333,00:09:50.673,"When you're wearing these babies, you can just walk on any surface you want, Up, down, below, turned around to the left."
00:09:50.799,00:09:52.967,These things really bring it all together.
00:09:54.302,00:09:57.514,"You have to turn them on, Morty. The shoes have to be turned on!"
00:10:00.350,00:10:07.315,He just came back into my life and you want to grab him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?
00:10:07.440,00:10:09.859,I was ordering you something for Valentine's Day.
00:10:09.984,00:10:14.572,"More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son!"
00:10:14.656,00:10:16.658,"-Everything cool in here? -It's fine, Davin."
00:10:16.783,00:10:19.494,"Okay, cool. You know we did something great today."
00:10:19.577,00:10:23.581,There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse.
00:10:23.665,00:10:30.004,"Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with him, I'll come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies."
00:10:30.130,00:10:41.975,"Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my Dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having, is that for the first time in his life Morty has a friend."
00:10:44.519,00:10:47.605,"-Maybe you're right. -Yeah, maybe I am."
00:10:47.730,00:10:51.151,"I'm my father's daughter, I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?"
00:10:52.652,00:10:55.238,Mrs. Smith? This is Principal Vagina. No relation.
00:10:55.321,00:10:58.616,I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me today.
00:11:04.122,00:11:07.000,You know you gotta turn the shoes on for them to work.
00:11:07.125,00:11:10.879,"I turned mine on, and getting down here was a leisurely breeze."
00:11:11.337,00:11:12.922,"I'm in a lot of pain, Rick."
00:11:16.634,00:11:17.927,collect my seeds?
00:11:18.052,00:11:21.680,"Are you kidding me? That's it, Rick! That's the last straw!"
00:11:21.848,00:11:29.981,"I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, You're a monster!"
00:11:30.106,00:11:33.568,"You're like Hitler, but even him cared about Germany or something."
00:11:33.651,00:11:35.486,"Okay, hold on just a second."
00:11:57.550,00:12:01.720,"Wow, Rick, that stuff just healed my broken legs instantly!"
00:12:01.888,00:12:04.682,I've never felt so good in my life!
00:12:04.807,00:12:05.808,Thank you!
00:12:05.975,00:12:09.020,Don't worry about it. Just come help me get these seeds.
00:12:09.145,00:12:10.396,"Sure thing, Rick."
00:12:10.521,00:12:18.613,"Not that you asked, but I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken leg serum at every corner drug store."
00:12:18.696,00:12:21.366,-The stuff was all over the place. -That's pretty crazy.
00:12:21.491,00:12:23.742,"There's just one problem, one little hang up."
00:12:23.826,00:12:27.997,"The dimension I visited was so advanced, they had also halted the aging process."
00:12:28.122,00:12:30.291,"Everyone was young, and they had been forever."
00:12:32.794,00:12:36.839,I was some sort of celebrity walking around. I was fascinating to them.
00:12:37.006,00:12:40.802,There were a lot of attractive women and they all wanted time with me.
00:12:40.969,00:12:49.143,"I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device... it's got no charge left, Morty."
00:12:49.269,00:12:51.980,It's as good as garbage. It's not gonna work anymore.
00:12:52.063,00:12:55.316,"Aw, geez, Rick, that's not good! What are we gonna do?"
00:12:55.441,00:12:58.361,I have to be at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?
00:12:58.486,00:13:01.948,"There's ways to get back home, but it's gonna be a little bit of a hassle."
00:13:02.073,00:13:05.201,We're going to have to go through interdimensional customs.
00:13:05.326,00:13:13.418,"So you're gonna have to do me a real solid. When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these to the bathroom and put them way up inside your butthole."
00:13:13.543,00:13:16.212,"-In my butt? -Way up inside, as far as they can fit."
00:13:16.337,00:13:18.797,"Oh, geez, I really don't want to have to do that."
00:13:18.965,00:13:21.217,"Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty."
00:13:21.342,00:13:25.138,They aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum.
00:13:25.263,00:13:28.433,And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times.
00:13:28.558,00:13:33.563,"You're young. You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut yet malleable."
00:13:33.646,00:13:36.899,You gotta do it for grandpa! Put these seeds inside your butt!
00:13:37.066,00:13:40.486,"-In my butt? -Come on, please. You have to do it!"
00:13:40.611,00:13:41.654,"Oh, man."
00:13:43.031,00:13:47.910,"Your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months."
00:13:48.077,00:13:51.873,-Why didn't you notify us? -I done been notifying you.
00:13:52.040,00:13:54.542,I left messages with Morty's grandfather.
00:13:54.667,00:14:04.843,"Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child-- -Wait, what am I celebrating? -I thought something was fishy, because it's usually him that's taking Morty out of school."
00:14:08.598,00:14:11.642,"We had a little incident, a student was frozen to death."
00:14:11.768,00:14:15.063,And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it.
00:14:15.188,00:14:17.899,"Everyone wants to take this to a racial place, I won't let them."
00:14:22.403,00:14:24.822,"So I told him, give me the Blimfarx."
00:14:24.906,00:14:27.825,This guy doesn't understand interstellar currency...
00:14:27.950,00:14:31.871,"It's like I'm trying to eat a flimflam, that's what we eat on Girvonesk..."
00:14:35.041,00:14:37.460,I don't like it here. I can't abide bureaucracy.
00:14:37.543,00:14:42.131,I don't like being told what to do. Did you get those seeds up your butt?
00:14:42.256,00:14:46.386,"Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? These things are pointy, they hurt."
00:14:46.511,00:14:49.222,That means they're good ones. You're a good kid.
00:14:49.347,00:14:53.101,"Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work, you've been a huge help."
00:14:59.982,00:15:02.902,"-Except you, you go over there. -Why?"
00:15:03.069,00:15:05.071,Random check. Go through the new machine.
00:15:05.196,00:15:06.364,What new machine?
00:15:06.447,00:15:08.741,It detects stuff all the way up your butt.
00:15:11.452,00:15:12.370,Red alert!
00:15:38.688,00:15:40.106,Don't think about it.
00:15:46.195,00:15:48.739,"Nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher!"
00:16:01.419,00:16:11.679,"Aw, hell no, dog, you know me, I'm just trying to-- I need to type in the coordinates to our world. Cover me!"
00:16:11.804,00:16:14.515,"Aw, man! I don't want to shoot nobody!"
00:16:14.640,00:16:18.060,"They're just robots, Morty. It's okay to shoot them."
00:16:20.605,00:16:23.065,-My leg is shot off! -Glenn's bleeding to death!
00:16:23.232,00:16:26.402,-Someone call his wife and children! -They're not robots!
00:16:26.527,00:16:30.072,"It's a figure of speech! They're bureaucrats, I don't respect them!"
00:16:30.198,00:16:33.242,Keep shooting! You have no idea what prison is like here!
00:16:36.412,00:16:38.581,Holy crap! This is insane!
00:16:48.799,00:16:50.676,We gotta get the hell out of here!
00:16:55.598,00:16:58.809,Wow! Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?
00:17:05.066,00:17:08.861,"-You're Morty, right? -You can get his number later. Come on."
00:17:08.986,00:17:11.405,You gotta get those seeds out of your ass.
00:17:11.531,00:17:14.951,"Oh, look, honey, it's our son, with Albert Ein-douche."
00:17:15.034,00:17:18.037,"-What? -I'm an angry father, not an improviser."
00:17:18.204,00:17:22.041,"Hi, Jerry. Oh my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class?"
00:17:22.208,00:17:27.129,"We talked about this, your parents and I are very disappointed in this behavior."
00:17:28.381,00:17:30.007,No? No takers?
00:17:30.091,00:17:32.843,"You should not touch that, it's beyond your reasoning."
00:17:32.927,00:17:34.220,You're beyond our reasoning!
00:17:34.345,00:17:35.888,-Takes one to know one! -Dad!
00:17:36.013,00:17:39.600,How could you make my son miss an entire semester of school?
00:17:39.725,00:17:44.397,"He's not a hot girl, he can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's!"
00:17:44.522,00:17:48.693,-What are you guys doing with my stuff? -We're moving you... to a nursing home.
00:17:48.818,00:17:53.030,A nursing home? Are you nuts? I'm a genius! I build robots for fun.
00:17:53.155,00:17:59.453,"Now you can build baskets, and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS -and mentally scar scouts on Christmas. -What does that mean?"
00:17:59.579,00:18:01.998,"-It's personal. -Dad, Mom, come on!"
00:18:02.331,00:18:05.585,"-Rick just needed my help, is all. -Morty, stay out of this."
00:18:05.710,00:18:09.130,You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.
00:18:09.297,00:18:11.799,Are you trying to say that he's stupid or something?
00:18:11.924,00:18:13.134,"Don't high road us, dad."
00:18:13.301,00:18:17.305,You know well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes!
00:18:17.430,00:18:20.975,"I don't know what you mean, could you be a little bit more specific?"
00:18:21.058,00:18:22.101,"Oh, for crying out!"
00:18:22.184,00:18:25.855,He's got some kind of disability. Is that what you want us to say?
00:18:25.938,00:18:28.733,"-I do? -Well, duh doy, son."
00:18:28.858,00:18:32.987,"Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids."
00:18:33.070,00:18:36.616,"If you want to compete in this world, you've got to work twice as hard."
00:18:36.741,00:18:40.620,"Aw, geez, dad... That's a lot to drop on a kid all at once."
00:18:40.745,00:18:45.291,"-Morty, tell them the square root of pi. -Come on, Rick, you know I can't."
00:18:45.416,00:18:46.709,The square root of pi!
00:18:46.792,00:18:51.172,"1,77245385. Whoa!"
00:18:51.339,00:18:54.216,"-What the hell? -Holy crap, he's right!"
00:18:57.970,00:19:05.019,"The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system. Wow, I'm so smart!"
00:19:05.770,00:19:09.148,"I told you, school is stupid. It's not how you learn things."
00:19:09.315,00:19:13.319,"Morty is a gifted child, he has a special mind, that's why he's my helper."
00:19:13.444,00:19:17.490,He's like me! He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life.
00:19:22.119,00:19:25.164,"Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop."
00:19:25.331,00:19:29.669,"No, I understand. Maybe we overreacted, but..."
00:19:29.794,00:19:39.053,"-he has to keep going to school. -Okay, Jerry, you drive a hard bargain, You really wear the pants around here."
00:19:39.136,00:19:44.433,"I just want you to know, from now on, it's gonna be a 100% honesty and open, clear communication."
00:19:47.144,00:19:51.190,"-No idea what you're talking about. -Okay, well..."
00:19:51.357,00:19:54.652,"Morty, it's your bed time in an hour. Don't stay up all night again."
00:19:54.777,00:19:59.365,"This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family."
00:19:59.865,00:20:03.953,"And now, Beth, if you will have me, I would love to have you."
00:20:04.078,00:20:06.706,You know what? Okay!
00:20:06.831,00:20:10.668,Holy cow! I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.
00:20:10.793,00:20:17.508,"Full disclosure, Morty: it's not. Temporary superintelligence is a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectum."
00:20:17.591,00:20:33.190,"-Aw, man! -Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're going to lose your motor skills and a significant amount of brain functionality Aw, man! Aw, geez!"
00:20:33.315,00:20:37.194,"I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come."
00:20:37.319,00:20:41.699,"I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up to get your parents off my back."
00:20:41.782,00:20:43.576,Now we're gonna have to go get more.
00:20:43.659,00:20:46.078,And then we're gonna go on even more adventures.
00:20:46.203,00:20:52.668,"And you're going to keep your mouth shut 'cause the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart."
00:20:52.752,00:20:55.796,"But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things."
00:20:55.880,00:20:57.339,and you're gonna be part of them.
00:20:57.465,00:21:00.676,"Together we're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty."
00:21:00.801,00:21:04.054,"Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy."
00:21:04.180,00:21:06.223,We're the only friends we've got.
00:21:06.348,00:21:09.894,"It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty, and their adventures, Morty."
00:21:09.977,00:21:13.522,"Rick and Morty forever! A hundred years, Rick and Morty's things."
00:21:13.647,00:21:17.485,"Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time."
00:21:17.610,00:21:20.905,"All day long, forever. All a hundred days."
00:21:21.030,00:21:23.449,"Rick and Morty forever, a hundred times."

00:00:44.294,00:00:45.420,What?
00:00:45.546,00:00:46.672,Why are you looking at me?
00:00:46.797,00:00:48.131,You want to go outside?
00:00:48.257,00:00:49.550,Outside?
00:00:52.386,00:00:53.387,Outside?
00:01:02.062,00:01:04.064,-What's wrong? -Your idiot dog!
00:01:04.189,00:01:06.191,"Oh, he didn't mean it, dad! Did you Snuffles?"
00:01:06.316,00:01:08.610,"-You're a good boy. -Don't praise him now, Morty!"
00:01:08.735,00:01:11.613,He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog. Bad!
00:01:11.738,00:01:14.741,"-Morty, I need your help tonight. -Hey, wait, hold on a second."
00:01:14.866,00:01:20.956,"You wouldn't, by any chance, have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?"
00:01:21.123,00:01:23.667,I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior.
00:01:23.792,00:01:25.252,I wouldn't pull that thread.
00:01:25.377,00:01:26.712,"-Come on, Morty. -Listen, Rick!"
00:01:26.837,00:01:34.386,"If you're gonna stay here rent free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family!"
00:01:34.511,00:01:37.764,You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!
00:01:39.600,00:01:42.978,"Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry."
00:01:46.982,00:01:48.525,"Alright, Ruffles--What's his name?"
00:01:48.609,00:01:51.361,-Snuffles. -Snuffles. Shake.
00:01:51.486,00:01:52.946,Roll over.
00:01:53.488,00:01:55.115,Go to the bathroom.
00:01:57.909,00:01:59.494,No way.
00:01:59.620,00:02:04.499,"Yeah, you're at the top of your game, now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty."
00:02:04.625,00:02:06.001,"That was fantastic, Rick!"
00:02:06.168,00:02:09.212,"If you like that, boy you're really going to flip your lid over this one."
00:02:10.047,00:02:15.427,"-What is it? -It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear you can enter people's dreams, Morty."
00:02:15.552,00:02:17.512,It's like that movie that you keep crowing about.
00:02:17.638,00:02:19.556,-You talkin' about Inception? -That's right.
00:02:19.640,00:02:22.934,"This is gonna be a lot like that except, you know, it's gonna make sense."
00:02:23.060,00:02:25.812,-Inception a made sense... -You don't have to try to impress me.
00:02:25.937,00:02:33.028,"Tonight we'll go into the home of your math teacher, Mister Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math."
00:02:33.195,00:02:36.782,"That way you can, you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time."
00:02:36.907,00:02:41.662,"Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?"
00:02:41.787,00:02:45.457,"Are you listening? Homework is stupid, the whole point is to get less of it."
00:02:45.582,00:02:48.502,"Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing."
00:02:48.627,00:02:50.462,We're gonna incept your teacher.
00:02:50.587,00:02:52.881,You're frustrating me.
00:02:57.928,00:03:01.431,"Nice, Mrs. Pancakes, real nice."
00:03:05.560,00:03:09.731,"-You don't know me! -Then let me get to know you, damn it!"
00:03:09.856,00:03:11.108,"Uh, oh. Spoilers!"
00:03:11.274,00:03:12.734,I'm a full season behind.
00:03:12.859,00:03:17.072,"Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house."
00:03:17.239,00:03:20.701,-It's really weird. -It's about to get a whole lot weirder.
00:03:27.249,00:03:29.459,Wheat Thins. Wheat Thins.
00:03:29.584,00:03:32.713,"-I'll take two. -Oh, I think you've had enough, sir."
00:03:32.838,00:03:34.339,You don't know me.
00:03:36.633,00:03:38.885,"Alright, Morty, time to make our move."
00:03:39.010,00:03:40.887,-Make it bounce. -No you didn't.
00:03:41.012,00:03:43.265,-Oh jiggle it now. -You better stop with that.
00:03:43.390,00:03:45.475,Allah akbar!
00:03:45.600,00:03:51.898,"We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna nine-eleven it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math. Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!"
00:03:52.023,00:03:54.526,The name's not Buddy. It's Goldenfold.
00:03:54.651,00:03:56.987,Nice to Wheat You!
00:03:59.156,00:04:00.782,"Take cover, Morty!"
00:04:03.952,00:04:06.455,Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated.
00:04:06.538,00:04:10.542,"I mean, the guy teaches high school math, I didn't take him for an active dreamer."
00:04:10.667,00:04:13.628,"We gotta take him out so he wakes up, Morty. But we can't get killed."
00:04:13.754,00:04:16.757,"If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty."
00:04:20.343,00:04:22.345,You avoid getting shot in real life all the time.
00:04:22.471,00:04:24.723,Just do the same thing here and we'll be fine!
00:04:24.806,00:04:26.933,"Now, bring me my slippers."
00:04:27.642,00:04:29.978,"Now, be my foot stool, Snuffles!"
00:04:30.103,00:04:33.607,This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog.
00:04:33.732,00:04:36.443,Oh yeah. This should play out just fine.
00:04:36.568,00:04:41.698,"You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?"
00:04:49.790,00:04:51.958,"Oh my God, he's trying to tell us something."
00:05:02.552,00:05:05.347,He's saying I love Obama! So cute!
00:05:05.472,00:05:07.557,"I'm posting this online, like, right now."
00:05:07.682,00:05:10.685,I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing?
00:05:29.496,00:05:32.123,"Goldenfold! We're coming out, we just wanna talk!"
00:05:32.249,00:05:37.379,-Why would I negotiate with you? -Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen.
00:05:37.504,00:05:40.048,-And because I have a human shield. -Mrs. Pancake!
00:05:43.218,00:05:45.846,"Oh no, Morty! His subconscious is panicking!"
00:05:55.188,00:05:56.147,"Relax, Morty!"
00:05:56.273,00:05:58.608,Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute! Come on!
00:05:59.860,00:06:01.444,Hey! You don't know me.
00:06:01.570,00:06:09.452,"Oh no, Rick! Look! Goldenfold landed the plane and he's created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall into a giant vat of lava!"
00:06:09.578,00:06:12.914,"Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable."
00:06:13.039,00:06:19.087,"That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything'll go one hundred times slower."
00:06:19.212,00:06:20.755,It'll buy us time to figure this out!
00:06:20.881,00:06:26.261,"You don't know m-- Alright, let's go."
00:06:35.520,00:06:38.148,"-Don't judge, Morty. -Okay alright well."
00:06:38.273,00:06:40.233,"Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there."
00:06:40.399,00:06:43.111,I'll go ask her to tell Goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.
00:06:43.236,00:06:44.279,"Whoa, whoa, Morty."
00:06:44.446,00:06:47.908,The trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea.
00:06:47.991,00:06:51.786,"Listen to me, if we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend."
00:06:59.127,00:07:01.338,"Oh, man, I'm sorry, no, no."
00:07:01.504,00:07:02.714,"-Come here. -No, thanks."
00:07:02.839,00:07:05.675,"-Wow, come over here, baby. -No, I'm okay."
00:07:09.554,00:07:11.765,"-Summer! -Hey there, stranger."
00:07:11.890,00:07:16.937,-What do you think of these things? -Oh ah! Oh! Gross! Gross!
00:07:17.020,00:07:20.899,What's the matter with you? Calm down! You're kinda killing the vibe in here.
00:07:20.982,00:07:23.276,-It's Summer! -Aw geez!
00:07:23.443,00:07:30.492,"Goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your underage sister."
00:07:30.617,00:07:31.785,Can you blame him?
00:07:31.910,00:07:36.039,"Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich."
00:07:36.164,00:07:39.668,-Oh my god. Put some clothes on! -Put some clothes on!
00:07:43.129,00:07:46.675,Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death!
00:07:46.800,00:07:48.760,Off with their heads!
00:07:49.177,00:07:51.513,"Time to go another dream deep, Morty!"
00:07:59.562,00:08:06.319,"Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Pancakes is dream version of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick?"
00:08:06.486,00:08:08.738,"Geez, I don't know, Morty. What do you want from me?"
00:08:14.577,00:08:16.997,"-Oh, here we go! -Holy crap!"
00:08:17.122,00:08:22.502,Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an 80's horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
00:08:24.671,00:08:27.007,"You can run, but you can't hide, bitch."
00:08:29.217,00:08:32.012,"Whoa, hey, buddy. What you got going on there?"
00:08:37.225,00:08:39.394,That is Awesome.
00:08:39.561,00:08:44.357,Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.
00:08:44.524,00:08:48.445,Okay. Yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over.
00:08:48.611,00:08:53.158,"Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience -and then rip it away. -Why not?"
00:08:53.283,00:08:55.702,"I don't know, it's Indian giving."
00:09:00.540,00:09:04.753,The vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill.
00:09:04.878,00:09:13.470,It was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast was transformed into man's subservient little buddy.
00:09:19.768,00:09:20.852,Aw! Oh my god!
00:09:20.977,00:09:24.355,He recognizes the other dogs on TV.
00:09:32.238,00:09:33.364,Holy crap...
00:09:33.490,00:09:35.867,"We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!"
00:09:43.333,00:09:45.001,The little girl!
00:09:51.674,00:09:52.759,Are you kidding me?
00:09:52.884,00:09:55.178,"Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here."
00:10:00.350,00:10:02.852,"Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams!"
00:10:15.490,00:10:17.325,"Where are my testicles, Summer?"
00:10:19.786,00:10:21.830,"Where are my testicles, Summer?"
00:10:21.955,00:10:24.457,They were removed. Where have they gone?
00:10:25.875,00:10:28.837,"That's an intense line of questioning, Snuffles."
00:10:29.337,00:10:30.797,Do not call me that!
00:10:31.840,00:10:35.718,Snuffles was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball.
00:10:35.844,00:10:38.138,Because my fur is pretty and white.
00:10:38.221,00:10:41.850,"Okay. Snowball. Just calm down, okay?"
00:10:41.975,00:10:43.893,-You're scaring me. -Scaring you?
00:10:44.018,00:10:53.820,"Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the Dachshund?"
00:10:56.239,00:10:58.658,"Okay, is everything okay in here?"
00:10:58.783,00:11:01.411,Jerry. Come to rub my face in urine again?
00:11:01.536,00:11:06.124,"No! No, we were... just seeing if Summer wanted to..."
00:11:07.041,00:11:10.503,Go one of our famous midnight family walks!
00:11:10.670,00:11:12.881,Yeah. Totally. Let's go.
00:11:15.884,00:11:19.596,You will walk when it is time to walk.
00:11:24.350,00:11:26.685,"What are we here for again? Incepting, trying to get..."
00:11:26.769,00:11:28.813,We're trying to incept me to get an A. In math?
00:11:28.938,00:11:30.315,Oh yeah.
00:11:34.986,00:11:36.529,"Man, he sure says 'bitch' a lot!"
00:11:36.695,00:11:39.532,"You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!"
00:11:39.698,00:11:44.162,"Hold on, Morty, you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can't hide."
00:11:44.245,00:11:49.292,"-I say we try hiding. -That's the opposite of-- Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?"
00:11:49.375,00:11:51.544,"Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there."
00:11:51.710,00:11:56.507,"Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us. You know?"
00:11:56.633,00:11:58.509,"I think it's a good idea, Rick."
00:11:58.593,00:12:00.511,Worst case scenario: we're back to running.
00:12:06.309,00:12:07.352,"Wow, you know what?"
00:12:07.477,00:12:09.854,I mean it looks like we could just hid this whole time.
00:12:09.979,00:12:11.314,That was some good thinking.
00:12:11.439,00:12:14.275,"Thanks. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while."
00:12:15.276,00:12:19.155,You can run... but you can't hide!
00:12:25.078,00:12:27.372,Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day.
00:12:27.455,00:12:28.623,That's when we make our move.
00:12:35.129,00:12:39.467,Snuffles! We didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding.
00:12:39.592,00:12:41.636,"Dad, he wants to be called Snowball."
00:12:41.803,00:12:43.972,"Well, I'm not calling him that, that's ridiculous."
00:12:44.097,00:12:51.062,"You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery."
00:12:51.187,00:12:55.066,Ha. You think you can control me with a haircut?
00:13:02.781,00:13:04.993,"Hi, honey. You're home early. How was your day?"
00:13:05.118,00:13:08.288,"-I don't want to talk about it. -Yeah, you never want to talk about it."
00:13:10.999,00:13:14.460,Out there. Not in here.
00:13:14.585,00:13:16.921,I know. I know.
00:13:17.046,00:13:20.508,I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon.
00:13:20.633,00:13:23.970,"-I love you, Melissa. -I love you too, Terry."
00:13:25.638,00:13:26.723,"Morty, this is perfect."
00:13:26.889,00:13:31.728,"After a little Scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him."
00:13:35.732,00:13:37.442,Scary Terry's having a nightmare.
00:13:51.998,00:14:01.924,"Ah, well, Mr. Terry. Why don't you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch!"
00:14:04.510,00:14:10.391,"-Bitch... -Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch?"
00:14:10.516,00:14:13.519,"-Hey, leave him alone! -Yeah! This is a bunch of bull crap."
00:14:13.644,00:14:16.356,Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone!
00:14:16.439,00:14:18.483,Why don't you let the guy say whatever he wants!
00:14:18.608,00:14:23.488,"Well, I never! I see no reason to stand here and take this."
00:14:23.613,00:14:26.199,"You're puttin' too much pressure on yourself, Scary Terry."
00:14:26.324,00:14:29.077,"You know, I mean, you're perfectly scary enough as it is."
00:14:29.202,00:14:30.370,"Hey, yo, Scary-T."
00:14:30.453,00:14:34.332,"Don't even trip about your pants... dog. Here's a pair on us, fool."
00:14:36.709,00:14:38.753,-I don't know what to say. -Don't need to.
00:14:38.920,00:14:42.215,"-We got you, dog. -You're our boy, dog. Don't even trip."
00:14:48.596,00:14:52.350,"Oh hey, it's you guys."
00:14:53.101,00:14:55.353,I haven't seen him this relaxed in years.
00:14:55.436,00:14:58.398,"If you guys ever need anything, just say the word."
00:14:58.481,00:15:01.275,"As a matter of fact, there is something you could help us with."
00:15:02.985,00:15:06.656,"-Q, R, you won't get very far... -I always hated that song!"
00:15:11.244,00:15:13.413,"These halves don't belong together, bitch!"
00:15:17.834,00:15:19.669,Sex is sacred!
00:15:25.758,00:15:29.137,"This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!"
00:15:33.641,00:15:37.520,"I know one thing for sure, I'm giving Morty an A in math."
00:15:37.645,00:15:41.774,And that's my idea. That is an original thought.
00:15:51.492,00:15:53.161,"Oh, man, what's going on?"
00:15:53.286,00:16:04.130,"Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, turned on Jerry, Beth and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty."
00:16:05.089,00:16:08.468,I can't believe how mean Snuffles got just because he's smart.
00:16:08.551,00:16:10.470,This is why I choose to get C's.
00:16:11.971,00:16:13.055,-Dad! -Rick!
00:16:15.183,00:16:17.518,"-Oh thank god, Morty. -Oh, you're welcome..."
00:16:17.643,00:16:19.979,"Alright, let's get out of here. If we hurry..."
00:16:20.104,00:16:24.192,we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or somethin' before the dogs completely take over.
00:16:24.317,00:16:28.696,"Whoa, we're not going anywhere. This is my house, -I'm not abandoning it. -It's all over, Jerry."
00:16:28.821,00:16:31.157,The dogs are on a path to total world domination.
00:16:31.282,00:16:34.035,"But hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?"
00:16:34.160,00:16:35.912,Wait a minute. I have an idea.
00:16:42.502,00:16:45.379,See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns.
00:16:45.505,00:16:47.089,That means I own them.
00:16:52.470,00:16:53.679,"Oh, great plan, Jerry."
00:16:53.804,00:16:55.223,Bring the boy to me.
00:16:58.684,00:17:00.728,"You were always kind to me, Morty."
00:17:00.853,00:17:03.481,That's why I will leave you with your testicles.
00:17:03.564,00:17:09.570,"From now on, you will be my best friend -and live by my side. -Thanks, Snuffles."
00:17:12.281,00:17:14.283,Begin phase two.
00:17:16.494,00:17:18.162,captures the Eastern seaboard.
00:17:18.287,00:17:22.458,"It appears clear, at this time, that the era of human superiority..."
00:17:22.542,00:17:24.502,...has come to a bitter end.
00:17:55.449,00:17:57.034,"Thank you, Fido."
00:17:58.077,00:18:01.205,"-Rick! I thought you were dead! -Ah, no, no, no, I was just playing dead."
00:18:01.330,00:18:03.541,Good news though. This whole thing's gonna be over soon.
00:18:03.624,00:18:05.084,"-What? -It's a dream, Morty."
00:18:05.209,00:18:14.594,"We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants we all went to sleep, then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside Snuffles' dream."
00:18:14.677,00:18:17.888,-But it's been like a whole year! -It's been six hours.
00:18:18.014,00:18:25.605,"Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality and dog time is one seventh human time, so, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like Inception."
00:18:25.688,00:18:28.274,"If it's confusing and stupid, so is everyone's favorite movie."
00:18:28.399,00:18:31.027,"Aw, man. I really liked this life."
00:18:31.193,00:18:33.404,"Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants."
00:18:33.529,00:18:35.823,"No, no that happened before you went to sleep, Morty."
00:18:35.948,00:18:37.658,You're sleeping in your crap right now.
00:18:37.783,00:18:43.956,"Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, is that you crapped your pants. I mean it's a mess out there."
00:18:44.123,00:18:50.838,"I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor -and a piece fell in my mouth. -Aw, man, geez, seriously?"
00:18:50.963,00:18:55.426,"Don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these."
00:18:55.885,00:18:57.845,Are these pills supposed to wake me up?
00:18:58.095,00:19:00.431,Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
00:19:00.556,00:19:02.725,"-What? -It's necessary for the plan, Morty."
00:19:06.270,00:19:09.649,"It's pretty bad, Emperor Snowball. We're gonna need to do another operation."
00:19:09.732,00:19:12.902,Anything. Anything for my precious Morty.
00:19:15.905,00:19:19.617,puts you in serious financial jeopardy! You could lose your kingdom.
00:19:19.700,00:19:25.748,"To hell with my kingdom, bean counter! I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness!"
00:19:28.209,00:19:29.877,We are not them!
00:19:31.962,00:19:34.048,We are not... them.
00:19:42.098,00:19:46.018,Assemble the troops. I've made a decision.
00:19:46.185,00:19:51.232,"Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty."
00:19:51.357,00:19:57.697,"Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs."
00:19:57.822,00:20:00.866,One that will not make the same mistakes as humanity.
00:20:00.991,00:20:03.869,And one where pet insurance will be mandatory.
00:20:03.994,00:20:10.251,"-I'm gonna miss you, Snowball. -You can call me Snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you too."
00:20:10.376,00:20:11.711,Very much.
00:20:21.512,00:20:22.930,-Jerry? -I'm sorry.
00:20:23.055,00:20:25.307,It's just like the end of Old Yeller.
00:20:25.599,00:20:29.395,"Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it."
00:20:29.520,00:20:33.149,Wow. A whole world populated by intelligent dogs.
00:20:33.315,00:20:35.484,-I wonder what it'll be like. -It'll be great.
00:20:35.609,00:20:40.740,"You know, it could be developed, into a very satisfying project for people of all ages."
00:20:40.865,00:20:43.659,"I mean, I'd watch it, Morty. For at least 11 minutes a pop."
00:20:43.743,00:20:45.536,"You know, maybe they'll do it board driven."
00:20:45.619,00:20:48.873,"You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick."
00:21:22.782,00:21:27.787,"Hi, guys. I'm your new teacher for Scary class, my name is Scary Mister Johnson."
00:21:27.870,00:21:30.372,"Uh, actually, you know what? That's my dad's name."
00:21:30.498,00:21:34.043,"So why don't you just call me Scary Glenn, yeah."
00:21:35.586,00:21:38.798,your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear.
00:21:38.881,00:21:47.807,"Which is, what is that? You know, so, here's what I say: you can't learn anything until you learn how to chill."
00:21:52.478,00:21:54.522,"This is how you dream, bitch."
00:00:49.758,00:00:52.511,"Um, merry Christmas? Hello?"
00:00:52.594,00:00:56.348,"My parents come over for the first time in years, can we stow the gadgets and look alive?"
00:00:56.473,00:00:58.600,Alive? For your parents?
00:00:58.725,00:00:59.810,"-Good one -Hey, man!"
00:00:59.935,00:01:02.938,You hey man! This holiday is about humanity.
00:01:03.105,00:01:05.899,"You know, I thought it was about being born half-god or something."
00:01:06.066,00:01:09.653,"Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now."
00:01:11.697,00:01:14.241,"Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook."
00:01:15.284,00:01:16.910,"A-ho, ho, ho, everybody."
00:01:17.077,00:01:19.538,"More like whoa whoa whoa, what is this, my parents are coming."
00:01:19.621,00:01:22.291,"Calm down, Jerry, this is Reuben, an old friend."
00:01:22.374,00:01:23.208,Pearl Harbor.
00:01:27.170,00:01:30.048,"Aww! Dad, that is so sweet!"
00:01:30.132,00:01:33.594,-Yeah it is. I don't get it. -Korea.
00:01:37.264,00:01:40.434,while you guys are having another day in Phil Collins' proverbial Paradise.
00:01:40.559,00:01:42.060,Huh. You think you know a guy.
00:01:43.102,00:01:51.445,"Okay, there's my parents. Now remember: no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like old school Jews on a Saturday."
00:01:51.570,00:01:53.947,"-Hey hey. -Merry Christmas, son."
00:01:54.114,00:01:55.991,"Uh... hi, can I help you?"
00:01:56.158,00:01:58.660,"Jerry, this is Jacob. Didn't you get our text message?"
00:01:58.785,00:01:59.745,No.
00:01:59.870,00:02:03.457,You must be Jerry. That's a fine looking apron. Williams Sonoma?
00:02:03.582,00:02:06.043,"I wish, but thank you."
00:02:06.209,00:02:08.545,So you're a... friend of the family...?
00:02:08.629,00:02:11.798,"The way we see it, he's a part of the family."
00:02:12.007,00:02:12.841,Wow.
00:02:13.300,00:02:21.266,"After your father's brush with cancer, and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered, how have we spent it, and how do we spend the rest of it?"
00:02:21.391,00:02:28.231,What are we going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions or a collection of real experiences?
00:02:28.357,00:02:30.359,"Holy crap, Joyce, that's amazing."
00:02:30.484,00:02:34.821,"Then Jacob came into our lives, and... we're learning to live again."
00:02:34.946,00:02:36.239,All three of us.
00:02:39.576,00:02:42.996,"Now we are talking. This man's got the apron and the egg nog, huh."
00:02:45.290,00:02:48.001,"-Heh. Hi Joyce. Leonard. Hello there. -Merry Christmas, man."
00:02:48.167,00:02:49.878,"Morty, a moment of your time?"
00:02:50.003,00:02:53.090,"-He's in bad shape, Morty. -Aw, geez, Rick, what'd you do?"
00:02:53.256,00:02:55.801,"Gee, thanks, Morty, what kind of monster do you think I am?"
00:02:59.012,00:03:02.391,"I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom, he'll know what's going on."
00:03:02.516,00:03:04.976,Where do I find Dr. Bloom?
00:03:05.102,00:03:07.229,"-In Reuben. -Reuben, Minne-Minnesota?"
00:03:11.066,00:03:13.360,for you to wrap your little walnut around everything.
00:03:13.485,00:03:16.530,Just hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse.
00:03:30.377,00:03:32.963,"Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance."
00:03:40.387,00:03:43.390,It's a business venture I've been cooking up on the side with Doctor Bloom.
00:03:45.934,00:03:49.438,Science isn't cheap. This should help put a dent in the overhead.
00:03:49.563,00:03:53.108,"Oh my god, this is insane. Spleen Mountain..."
00:03:53.275,00:03:55.569,Bladder Falls... Pirates of the Pancreas?
00:03:57.404,00:04:00.282,Huh? No. I'm just reading 'em out loud in the order that I'm seeing 'em.
00:04:02.367,00:04:04.369,it's because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby.
00:04:04.494,00:04:08.290,I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it. I guess I'm still a little defensive.
00:04:08.415,00:04:23.513,Let's just find Doctor Bloom. I'm picking up Mind the gap.
00:04:25.766,00:04:27.517,"It's really scary in here, Rick."
00:04:29.269,00:04:31.104,Reuben has seen some rough years. Don't judge.
00:04:31.271,00:04:34.149,Don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life goes OK.
00:04:42.574,00:04:44.201,That is an animatronic werewolf.
00:04:45.535,00:04:48.538,Who are you? Answer me! Where'd you come from?
00:04:50.582,00:04:54.795,"Poncho! That's quite enough. Morty, that's Poncho."
00:04:54.878,00:04:57.088,This is Roger and Annie.
00:04:57.214,00:05:00.884,And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.
00:05:03.220,00:05:07.808,"I don't know why, but the security system has shut down..."
00:05:07.933,00:05:11.728,and I'm afraid... the exhibits are unlocked.
00:05:11.812,00:05:12.813,Exhibits?
00:05:12.938,00:05:26.201,"Anatomy Park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the... Pirates of the Pancreas-- It is, first and foremost, a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases."
00:05:26.368,00:05:27.577,Diseases?
00:05:27.702,00:05:29.996,"Hey, doc. I got news for ya."
00:05:33.959,00:05:36.044,Hepatitis A! Run!
00:05:41.383,00:05:44.553,"Oh, the food goes in your mouth, girl."
00:05:45.637,00:05:46.763,"Oh, Jacob."
00:05:47.806,00:05:56.940,"I'm sorry, Jacob, I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents, are you like their caretaker, is that what it is...?"
00:05:57.065,00:06:03.572,"-We can go into detail later, son. -Now, wait, there's no point to secrecy, let's all live and die honestly."
00:06:03.697,00:06:07.492,"Your mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body and soul."
00:06:07.617,00:06:10.287,And when minds and souls are joined for eternity...
00:06:10.369,00:06:12.539,...and when eternity is at the door...
00:06:12.831,00:06:15.292,it's an invitation to let go of the body.
00:06:18.503,00:06:20.130,"Dad, please, what are you saying?"
00:06:20.255,00:06:23.216,"Whatever it is, it's beautiful, Leonard, and we support you."
00:06:25.760,00:06:27.637,like you're about to say Jacob is your lover.
00:06:27.762,00:06:31.099,"No, no no no no no. Jacob is your mother's lover."
00:06:32.142,00:06:39.149,"I watch them, sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet, almost always dressed as Superman."
00:06:43.612,00:06:47.282,"Jerry, this ham has got to be all you, right? It's incredible."
00:06:48.407,00:06:50.201,"Happy Human Holiday, dad."
00:06:54.873,00:06:57.834,Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system.
00:07:00.587,00:07:02.589,That's strange. Airflow is down twenty percent.
00:07:02.714,00:07:06.885,So the brain isn't getting enough oxygen. That's why security's offline.
00:07:06.968,00:07:08.553,"Well, I guess we better check it out."
00:07:20.732,00:07:21.733,I'll go.
00:07:28.114,00:07:29.449,We shouldn't be here.
00:07:29.532,00:07:31.910,"Whatever you do, do not fire that thing in here."
00:07:31.993,00:07:35.830,We must save Reuben. This is my life's work.
00:07:38.249,00:07:46.007,"Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of these bacteria, but the scar tissue keeps them... dormant..."
00:07:46.132,00:07:47.592,"Morty, get down!"
00:07:56.184,00:07:59.396,"-Oh, what are those things? -Tuberculosis! Coming in fast!"
00:07:59.562,00:08:04.609,-Not faster than a bullet! -No! Do you know what you've done?
00:08:09.906,00:08:12.409,Get to the digestive tract! He's coughing!
00:08:16.871,00:08:18.832,"Just take a deep breath, Reuben."
00:08:18.957,00:08:21.209,You're not gonna die! What's your name?
00:08:21.334,00:08:31.011,My name is-- Rick! Reuben's got tuberculosis!
00:08:31.094,00:08:37.726,"Oh, great work, Morty! Okay, I'll just cure it and then-- Okay. Well, I can't cure death."
00:08:37.851,00:08:39.936,"This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man."
00:08:40.020,00:08:46.693,"If the situation keeps darkening Obviously I'm biased, but I think it's great."
00:08:50.905,00:08:53.992,"We don't whitewash it either, Morty. I mean, the pirates are really rapey."
00:08:54.826,00:09:00.040,"The top priority is to get you guys out of there but, I'm saying, if it becomes impossible, please you gotta treat yourself."
00:09:01.207,00:09:03.835,"Oh, man, what is that horrible smell?"
00:09:07.797,00:09:11.426,The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas.
00:09:11.593,00:09:14.971,"We're inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy Park is doomed."
00:09:15.055,00:09:17.807,"Forget about the park, Doctor. How do we get out?"
00:09:17.932,00:09:21.019,The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it?
00:09:21.102,00:09:24.814,There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.
00:09:24.939,00:09:26.691,"Everybody, head for the colon."
00:09:26.816,00:09:29.736,Now I'm taking orders from a twelve year old boy?
00:09:29.861,00:09:34.157,Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged.
00:09:34.282,00:09:38.620,This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eye on Annie.
00:09:38.745,00:09:43.458,She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.
00:09:43.625,00:09:47.504,"Intestines are ahead to the left. Then to the right. Then left, etcetera."
00:09:49.798,00:09:53.468,"Hey, just so you know, I'm actually fourteen. So, you know.."
00:09:53.635,00:09:55.637,-What? -Not twelve.
00:09:56.012,00:09:56.846,Okay.
00:09:57.388,00:10:00.183,"You know, because, he just said I was twelve."
00:10:00.350,00:10:02.018,Oh. Good for you.
00:10:23.748,00:10:29.003,-It goes on like this for miles. -Then we get to the large intestine.
00:10:29.838,00:10:32.006,Sshh. I hear something.
00:10:36.010,00:10:41.099,Don't move. Gonorrhea can't see us if we don't... move...
00:10:43.434,00:10:45.311,"Wait, I was wrong, I was thinking of a T. Rex!"
00:10:47.939,00:10:48.940,Move!
00:10:52.861,00:10:53.987,We're sitting ducks!
00:10:54.112,00:10:56.322,"Doc, didn't you say that the body was filling with gas?"
00:10:56.447,00:10:57.407,Yes. Why?
00:10:57.532,00:11:00.160,-Kid. You're a genius. -Are you mad?
00:11:00.243,00:11:01.536,"Everybody, in here!"
00:11:02.704,00:11:06.666,"Hey, Gonorrhea! How's this for a burning sensation?"
00:11:22.140,00:11:25.727,"Oh, sing it, Summer. Oh, I love to hear you sing."
00:11:29.814,00:11:31.983,"Jerry, come on, this is what you wanted."
00:11:32.108,00:11:34.360,"I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for."
00:11:34.485,00:11:36.112,I'm being punished for taking your iPad.
00:11:36.196,00:11:42.285,"What? Jerry, let that stuff go. Okay? I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier, let's just be here."
00:11:43.620,00:11:45.538,-Summer! -Ethan? What are you doing here?
00:11:45.704,00:11:48.541,"I've been texting you for hours, what the hell!"
00:11:48.707,00:11:51.252,"I don't have my phone, I'm doing a human holiday!"
00:11:51.377,00:11:53.755,Well did you even consider how that might make me feel?
00:11:53.880,00:11:57.383,How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?
00:11:57.508,00:12:00.470,"-Summer, do you have a boyfriend? -Yeah, do you, Summer?"
00:12:00.595,00:12:02.972,"I don't know, Ethan, do I?"
00:12:03.097,00:12:07.227,"Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man."
00:12:11.231,00:12:12.482,to get the growth ray online.
00:12:12.607,00:12:14.984,"If it works, we'll be regular sized in a few minutes."
00:12:15.109,00:12:17.445,I hope Reuben's not in a room with carpets or upholstery.
00:12:18.488,00:12:21.241,-What the hell is that? -The sphincter dam.
00:12:21.366,00:12:26.496,"We built it when Reuben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse load."
00:12:27.330,00:12:29.748,I've almost got it. Everybody move inside the circle.
00:12:31.125,00:12:33.586,"Poncho, what is this in your backpack?"
00:12:33.752,00:12:38.007,"That's bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho?"
00:12:38.132,00:12:40.843,"-Everybody get back! -Poncho, you son of a bitch!"
00:12:40.969,00:12:44.305,You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me?
00:12:44.430,00:12:45.890,"That's right, baby!"
00:12:45.974,00:12:49.686,A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population.
00:12:49.852,00:13:17.171,"I'll take the highest bidder: Al Quaeda, North Korea, Republicans, Shriners, balding men that work out, people on the internet that are turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers, anything is better than working for you, you pompous, negligent, iTunes-gift card as a holiday bonus giving mother-- Ouch!"
00:13:22.135,00:13:25.430,-You guys... -It's gonna burst! Go! Go! Go! Go!
00:13:28.141,00:13:29.475,-My foot is stuck. -No!
00:13:29.600,00:13:32.603,It's okay. It's okay. Just go. Tell my family I love them.
00:13:32.729,00:13:39.027,"They may be hard to find, my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it, I don't know you can Google-- No!"
00:13:42.322,00:13:44.365,"Let me ask you a question, Ethan."
00:13:44.490,00:13:49.078,"-Where's the anger coming from, man? -From Summer being a total bitch!"
00:13:49.203,00:13:51.706,Where's the anger coming from?
00:13:53.750,00:13:58.087,My brother... took me fishing once... in the bushes...
00:13:58.212,00:14:02.633,I can't... I can't... He made me feel like a girl!
00:14:02.759,00:14:05.261,He made me a girl!
00:14:06.387,00:14:10.099,"He didn't make you anything, man. You are who you are."
00:14:10.224,00:14:14.437,"She is who she is, now you go to her, brand new."
00:14:14.562,00:14:15.730,Come here right now.
00:14:15.813,00:14:18.733,"Oh my God, I'm so sorry, Ethan. I love you."
00:14:18.900,00:14:20.193,I love you so much.
00:14:22.653,00:14:25.448,"You did it again, Cubbie. Come here."
00:14:30.370,00:14:32.497,No! Stop! I hate this!
00:14:32.622,00:14:35.792,"Well, Christmas doesn't revolve around what you hate, son."
00:14:35.958,00:14:37.126,"Well, then I hate Christmas!"
00:14:37.251,00:14:40.671,"Enjoy being human, you guys are gross and lame!"
00:14:44.550,00:14:48.429,"but by the end of this journey, I'll be inside all of you."
00:14:49.389,00:14:53.393,My story begins during the dot com crash in the early nineties.
00:14:57.146,00:15:00.191,"Morty, you want to put it on mute or something. I'm trying to concentrate."
00:15:01.401,00:15:04.362,"Not now, Jerry. I've got much, much smaller fish to fry."
00:15:04.445,00:15:06.906,"I wanted to say, I'm sorry I ever judged you."
00:15:07.115,00:15:09.158,"Right now, you're my sanest relative."
00:15:09.283,00:15:13.371,"Relative... relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite."
00:15:13.454,00:15:15.039,Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?
00:15:15.123,00:15:17.250,"I'm hoping I can get to both of 'em, Rick."
00:15:21.421,00:15:23.297,We need to get to the left nipple!
00:15:23.423,00:15:27.218,"The body is decaying, the arterial transit system is useless..."
00:15:27.343,00:15:30.596,We can try the service shuttle. It's connected to the skeletal system.
00:15:30.680,00:15:32.348,That's why we call it the bone train.
00:15:32.598,00:15:35.977,"Would you like to ride the bone train, miss?"
00:15:36.102,00:15:41.983,"-If it'll get us out of here. -How about you, Morty, would you like to ride the bone train?"
00:15:42.108,00:15:45.194,"Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die, let's go."
00:15:46.863,00:15:51.284,"Well, I can see you're busy... Merry Christmas, Rick."
00:15:54.704,00:15:59.083,There's no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.
00:16:05.756,00:16:09.093,"No, you're right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that."
00:16:09.177,00:16:10.720,This is all my fault. You go on.
00:16:11.012,00:16:12.847,What the hell is that?
00:16:13.014,00:16:15.808,E. Coli outbreak! Hurry!
00:16:17.643,00:16:21.481,Oh. Wait. There is an autopilot. Wait!
00:16:21.606,00:16:25.359,"It's okay! Never mind, I wanted to sacrifice myself anyway."
00:16:29.405,00:16:30.990,They're chewing through the doors!
00:16:32.033,00:16:36.454,"We're in the areola, almost to the nipple, but we're also in a really bad situation!"
00:16:51.260,00:16:52.512,about what appears to be...
00:16:52.595,00:16:56.432,"...a giant, naked man over the continental United States."
00:16:56.516,00:16:59.519,We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom?
00:16:59.602,00:17:06.359,"Well, the eyes aren't twinkling and the dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a seventy mile cherry..."
00:17:06.484,00:17:09.654,"Thank you, Tom. Let's go now to Eric McMahan in Los Angeles."
00:17:09.779,00:17:12.281,"We've got feet here on the West Coast, Bill."
00:17:12.406,00:17:18.371,"Giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size, and you know what they say about that."
00:17:18.496,00:17:24.835,"Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what's going down in the Rocky Mountains."
00:17:57.368,00:18:00.204,-The nipple hole. -It's beautiful.
00:18:07.920,00:18:09.213,"Oh, no!"
00:18:19.932,00:18:23.352,"Um... Wait, did we have some sort of relationship with him?"
00:18:23.477,00:18:26.981,I think they're just like that? I think they're just good guys.
00:18:32.695,00:18:34.697,"God damn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing."
00:18:45.499,00:18:47.126,Jerry doesn't know what he's missing.
00:18:47.251,00:18:50.046,"He'll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time."
00:18:50.212,00:18:52.256,It has funny ways of bringing families together.
00:18:52.381,00:18:56.636,"I don't know. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it."
00:18:56.761,00:19:04.393,I don't know if our marriage will-- It's raining blood!
00:19:04.518,00:19:06.062,Oh shit! Find Jerry!
00:19:07.021,00:19:10.358,"-Jerry! -It's all right, the TV says there's nothing to worry about."
00:19:10.608,00:19:17.365,"The giant, naked sky Santa has exploded, blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country."
00:19:17.448,00:19:18.741,Everything should be fine.
00:19:20.868,00:19:23.996,"-Dad, can I have my phone back? -Sure, sweetie. Here."
00:19:24.163,00:19:27.667,Everybody take a device. It'll help you relax.
00:19:27.750,00:19:29.960,-This is nice. -Yeah.
00:19:30.086,00:19:33.381,"Yeah, look, I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob."
00:19:33.506,00:19:36.467,"No we didn't, dad. No we didn't."
00:19:38.094,00:19:40.471,Too bad about Dr. Bloom. He was a genius.
00:19:40.596,00:19:43.307,The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park.
00:19:43.432,00:19:45.768,"Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom's work."
00:19:45.893,00:19:50.189,I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create an entirely new and safer park.
00:19:50.314,00:19:52.316,What about... Pirates of the Pancreas?
00:19:52.441,00:19:54.819,I think it was one of the most underrated attractions.
00:19:54.944,00:19:56.404,Booyah. Hold your breath.
00:19:58.030,00:20:00.533,"Hey, what the hell, Rick? What the hell, man!"
00:20:00.658,00:20:03.411,"I liked her! I really had something going there, Rick."
00:20:08.290,00:20:12.294,What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me. I don't know.
00:20:12.420,00:20:14.547,"Come on, let's get some stuffing, I'm starving."
00:20:17.425,00:20:23.597,"Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch a robot computer people, sitting around with their faces stuffed into computer screens."
00:20:23.848,00:20:25.975,Do you guys realize that Christ was born today?
00:20:26.100,00:20:29.103,"Jesus Christ, our savior, was born today."
00:20:29.270,00:20:32.440,Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?
00:21:05.931,00:21:06.891,"Loud and clear, Annie."
00:21:10.644,00:21:16.108,"Natalie Jacobs and Chris DeSeter from Microscopic Marketing, Zack from organ concepts and Jamie from new media."
00:21:16.275,00:21:17.276,"Hey, everybody."
00:21:17.401,00:21:18.486,"-Hey. -Hi, Rick."
00:21:22.698,00:21:31.665,"Um, so, we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here okay, what does a pancreas do, and the answer was, does it make pirates?"
00:21:31.749,00:21:39.423,"No, it makes insulin, you know so we're starting with a new-- Those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?"
00:21:39.548,00:21:41.717,Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit.
00:21:41.842,00:21:43.928,They're inside you building a monument to compromise.
00:21:49.141,00:21:51.644,Cool. And who pays me?
00:00:38.830,00:00:41.375,This is just sloppy craftsmanship.
00:00:41.500,00:00:45.879,"Hey, Rick! Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?"
00:00:49.007,00:00:52.928,"Yeah, there's something about the air, and just the way the sunshine is..."
00:00:53.052,00:00:56.515,"-Sure, buddy. Brilliant. Very convincing. -Convincing?"
00:00:56.640,00:00:59.101,"Oh, responsive, too, in real time! I love it."
00:00:59.226,00:01:00.894,Uh... Okay.
00:01:04.856,00:01:06.775,I'm going to work. Goodbye.
00:01:07.442,00:01:09.695,"-What's with mom? -Oh, what's with Mom?"
00:01:09.861,00:01:13.240,"So, you're saying that she's acting weird. How sophisticated."
00:01:13.323,00:01:16.243,"Careful, guys, you're gonna burn out the CPU with this one!"
00:01:16.368,00:01:18.912,"You know what, Rick? You're acting weird too."
00:01:18.996,00:01:21.748,"Whatever, Morty."
00:01:21.873,00:01:24.251,"Alright, well, I'll see you after school."
00:01:24.376,00:01:26.753,"Ow! Oof! Oh, dammit!"
00:01:26.878,00:01:28.547,"I'm alright, I'm okay."
00:01:31.800,00:01:33.802,Who can tell me what five times nine is?
00:01:35.512,00:01:37.139,"-Morty? -Um, me?"
00:01:37.264,00:01:38.765,What is five times nine?
00:01:45.355,00:01:48.358,Five times nine is at least forty. Come up here.
00:01:50.319,00:01:52.738,"Everybody, this is the best student."
00:01:54.990,00:01:56.241,"Teach us, Morty!"
00:01:56.366,00:01:58.910,-Interesting. -What do you want me to teach you?
00:01:59.328,00:02:01.788,How do you make concentrated dark matter?
00:02:01.913,00:02:04.583,"-Oh, that's a good question! -Concentrated, huh?"
00:02:04.708,00:02:08.378,Concentrated dark matter. The fuel for accelerated space travel.
00:02:08.503,00:02:10.213,-Do you know how to make it? -Um...
00:02:10.297,00:02:13.925,"Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa like a scientist?"
00:02:14.051,00:02:19.181,"Yeah, but he told me that I shouldn't go around spout'n off about his science and stuff."
00:02:19.306,00:02:21.975,I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot.
00:02:22.100,00:02:25.270,"Y'know, if you tell us, I'll be your girlfriend."
00:02:25.395,00:02:29.024,"-Uh, you will? -Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty."
00:02:29.149,00:02:32.819,"-Morty, there's a family emergency! -Stop right there."
00:02:32.944,00:02:34.321,If he leaves I'm giving him an F!
00:02:34.404,00:02:35.947,"-He doesn't care. -Aw, man!"
00:02:36.073,00:02:37.616,"Rick, I have to go back!"
00:02:37.741,00:02:39.409,I think I was about to get married!
00:02:39.534,00:02:41.203,-Take a shower with me. -What??
00:02:41.328,00:02:44.623,Listen to me! Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now.
00:02:48.627,00:02:52.631,"Morty, that's not class. That wasn't your teacher, this isn't your school."
00:02:52.714,00:02:54.299,This entire world is not the world.
00:02:54.424,00:02:56.927,We're inside a simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.
00:03:01.056,00:03:04.768,"Nanobotic renderings. Bunch of crazy, fake nonsense, Morty."
00:03:04.893,00:03:07.646,"I couldn't say so before, they won't monitor us in here."
00:03:07.771,00:03:09.439,Monitor us? Who?
00:03:09.564,00:03:10.857,"Zigerion Scammers, Morty."
00:03:10.982,00:03:14.069,"The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists."
00:03:14.193,00:03:17.447,"Lucky for us, they're also really uncomfortable with nudity."
00:03:17.572,00:03:18.532,"Come on, Rick!"
00:03:18.657,00:03:21.868,"If everyone's gonna be insane today, let me be insane with Jessica!"
00:03:21.993,00:03:23.328,I can't let you do that.
00:03:23.453,00:03:25.997,"-Give it to me! -No, you give it to me!"
00:03:26.081,00:03:27.624,"-Give it-- -Come on, Morty!"
00:03:36.383,00:03:38.552,"God, sir! They're still naked!"
00:03:38.677,00:03:41.888,"Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not."
00:03:42.013,00:03:44.349,"I think we should make Kevin look, sir."
00:03:44.474,00:03:47.102,What? No! Why would you even say that?
00:03:47.227,00:03:49.187,Sir? We have a situation over here.
00:03:49.312,00:03:52.149,"If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to God, Stu..."
00:03:52.274,00:03:55.694,"Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait, no wonder."
00:03:55.819,00:03:58.196,There's another real human in the simulator.
00:03:58.321,00:04:00.490,"Okay, Jerry. Big pitch meeting."
00:04:00.615,00:04:03.577,Make or break time. You can do this.
00:04:03.702,00:04:06.204,How did this happen? Where's the Abductions department?
00:04:06.329,00:04:08.915,Abductions just follows the acquisition order.
00:04:09.040,00:04:10.459,Don't put this on Acquisitions!
00:04:10.542,00:04:12.878,We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated.
00:04:12.961,00:04:17.048,"Well, Simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so..."
00:04:17.424,00:04:22.179,"Oh, I see! Oh, it was no one's fault! I'm sorry, well then, problem solved."
00:04:22.304,00:04:26.308,"Oh, wait, no, there's still another human in here! Who is he?"
00:04:26.433,00:04:28.143,"Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith."
00:04:28.226,00:04:31.062,So far he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation.
00:04:33.482,00:04:37.986,"keep his settings on auto and we'll deal with him later, Rick Sanchez is the target."
00:04:40.864,00:04:44.659,Gotta relax. It's just a pitch. Gotta relax.
00:04:53.460,00:04:56.755,Huh! Human music. I like it.
00:05:11.311,00:05:12.145,Rick!
00:05:12.229,00:05:16.149,"Keep your hands off your ding-dong, it's the only way we can speak freely."
00:05:19.569,00:05:22.280,You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details.
00:05:22.405,00:05:24.699,"Look, that guy is putting a bun between two hot dogs."
00:05:24.825,00:05:27.160,"I don't know, I've seen people do that before."
00:05:27.285,00:05:30.080,Look at that old lady. She's walking a cat on a leash.
00:05:30.205,00:05:32.249,Mrs. Spencer does that all the time.
00:05:32.374,00:05:35.377,I don't want to hear about Mrs. Spencer! She's an idiot.
00:05:35.502,00:05:37.838,"Alright, there. What about that, Morty?"
00:05:37.963,00:05:39.673,"OK, you got me on that one."
00:05:39.798,00:05:43.176,Really? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?
00:05:43.301,00:05:44.719,"No, I haven't seen that."
00:05:44.845,00:05:47.889,"Why would a pop tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick?"
00:05:48.014,00:05:51.601,That would be like the scariest place for them to live!
00:05:51.685,00:05:55.105,You're missing the point. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels?
00:05:55.188,00:05:58.483,Does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.
00:05:58.608,00:06:00.944,Why are they doing this? What do they want?
00:06:01.069,00:06:03.530,"That would be obvious, if you'd been paying attention."
00:06:05.824,00:06:08.034,The president of the United States is in here!
00:06:08.118,00:06:11.413,We need ten cc's of concentrated dark matter stat or he'll die!
00:06:11.538,00:06:14.624,Concentrated dark matter. They were asking about that in class.
00:06:14.749,00:06:18.169,It's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else.
00:06:18.295,00:06:21.172,These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets.
00:06:23.300,00:06:25.844,They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay.
00:06:25.969,00:06:27.846,"Wait, what are we gonna do?"
00:06:27.971,00:06:29.639,We're gonna scam the scammers.
00:06:29.723,00:06:32.350,And we're gonna take 'em for everything they've got.
00:06:32.475,00:06:35.145,National Apple Farmers of America.
00:06:35.270,00:06:38.690,Welcome to our ad agency. I'm Jerry Smith.
00:06:40.317,00:06:42.777,All right. I'll just get to the pitch.
00:06:52.203,00:06:53.872,What are apples?
00:06:54.998,00:06:58.877,Apples are food. And when do we need food?
00:06:59.711,00:07:00.921,When we're hungry.
00:07:02.297,00:07:05.634,"With that, I give you your new slogan."
00:07:07.636,00:07:10.555,"-Well, say something. Do you like it? -Yes."
00:07:10.680,00:07:17.771,-You do? -Yes -So... I sold it? I sold the idea? -Yes.
00:07:17.938,00:07:20.357,"-Oh, my God. Thank you! -Thank you."
00:07:20.482,00:07:23.360,-You're welcome. Thank you. -You're welcome.
00:07:27.364,00:07:30.116,Hey! I just sold my first pitch!
00:07:30.241,00:07:31.993,-Slow down! -Looking good!
00:07:32.118,00:07:33.161,My man.
00:07:36.331,00:07:37.290,Hello.
00:07:37.415,00:07:39.918,Guess who just sold the apples campaign.
00:07:40.043,00:07:42.629,-Who just sold the apples campaign? -Me!
00:07:42.754,00:07:45.799,I guess it wasn't a rip-off of Got Milk after all?
00:07:45.924,00:07:48.385,-Guess someone was wrong? -Yes.
00:07:48.510,00:07:49.552,All is forgiven.
00:07:49.636,00:07:52.555,"Right now, I've got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse."
00:07:52.639,00:07:55.809,-and I'm coming home to share it with you. -Okay.
00:07:55.934,00:07:57.310,"-Wait, really? -Yes."
00:07:57.435,00:07:59.521,Yes! See you in ten minutes.
00:08:02.232,00:08:03.441,-Looking good! -Slow down!
00:08:03.566,00:08:04.651,My man.
00:08:07.153,00:08:10.031,"Geez, Rick, I don't know if I like this plan, you know."
00:08:10.156,00:08:13.743,"Crowds, they have a tendency to make me really nervous."
00:08:13.868,00:08:17.747,Relax. It's just a bunch of ones and zeros out there. You're gonna be fine.
00:08:17.872,00:08:20.709,"Just follow my lead. Yo, DJ, drop that beat!"
00:08:23.962,00:08:28.341,"Uh oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts."
00:08:33.513,00:08:35.306,"You got that right, Rick!"
00:08:41.896,00:08:44.858,Let me hear everybody say hey-oh. Yeah!
00:08:45.025,00:08:46.026,Hey-oh!
00:08:46.109,00:08:47.652,All the ladies say yeah!
00:08:47.819,00:08:48.820,Yeah!
00:08:48.903,00:08:51.406,Everybody over 30 do this with your hand!
00:08:51.531,00:08:53.783,Everybody with a red shirt jump up and down!
00:09:12.927,00:09:20.435,"Yo. Everyone whose first name begins with an L who isn't Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten!"
00:09:23.480,00:09:25.815,"Run, Morty! Before the system reboots!"
00:09:40.663,00:09:45.043,My God! That's the best sex I've ever had in my life.
00:09:46.127,00:09:49.297,It's... too good.
00:09:49.631,00:09:53.510,"I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud."
00:09:53.635,00:09:56.179,"Oh, man, Rick! Where are we running to?"
00:09:56.304,00:10:03.603,"Out of the simulation! Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing and being rendered as we move through it."
00:10:03.770,00:10:07.982,"But while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to... the edge."
00:10:08.358,00:10:10.193,-Here we go. -Holy crap!
00:10:10.318,00:10:11.569,"Come on, Morty!"
00:10:12.779,00:10:14.781,"Sir, they're over the edge."
00:10:14.906,00:10:19.035,Yes they are. Just. As. Planned.
00:10:22.914,00:10:29.462,"Oh, this is going to be such a mind-- Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room."
00:10:29.587,00:10:31.297,That's how we're gonna scam them.
00:10:31.422,00:10:34.926,"Why do they keep coming after you, if you're so much smarter than them?"
00:10:35.051,00:10:36.553,It's became an obsession for them.
00:10:36.678,00:10:39.722,The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years.
00:10:39.848,00:10:42.642,"Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them. Aha!"
00:10:42.767,00:10:43.977,Here we go.
00:10:45.520,00:10:47.647,Grab as many processors as you can carry.
00:10:47.856,00:10:50.775,These guys are really good at making these chips.
00:10:52.360,00:10:55.738,I've got so many I can barely hold 'em all! Look at this!
00:10:55.864,00:10:57.115,"Oops, I dropped one."
00:10:57.198,00:11:00.410,"Don't worry, there's plenty of them, you little goofball."
00:11:02.370,00:11:04.414,"-Come here, Morty, gotcha! -Quit it!"
00:11:06.082,00:11:08.918,"Nothin' wrong with a little horseplay every now and then, little fella."
00:11:20.555,00:11:23.266,"Wow, whatya know, huh? That was easy."
00:11:23.391,00:11:25.810,"Totes malotes, dog."
00:11:25.935,00:11:27.812,-Just kinda hard to believe. -Believe it.
00:11:27.937,00:11:33.401,"And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry and the Zigerions got nothing of mine."
00:11:42.660,00:11:45.246,"-Yes. -Look, I'm a fraud."
00:11:45.371,00:11:49.250,Let's face it. Hungry for Apples is just a rip-off of Got Milk.
00:11:49.375,00:11:51.377,-It's almost identical. -Yes.
00:11:54.422,00:11:57.634,Um... I guess I'll just pack up my desk.
00:11:58.343,00:11:59.177,Yes.
00:12:02.597,00:12:03.598,Oh my God.
00:12:04.723,00:12:06.976,Wait. You know what? No!
00:12:07.310,00:12:11.189,The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions!
00:12:11.314,00:12:15.193,There's not even a single word in the two slogans that's shared.
00:12:15.318,00:12:18.988,It's a completely different slogan! It's different!
00:12:19.113,00:12:22.325,"And I shouldn't be fired, I should be promoted!"
00:12:22.450,00:12:24.244,"-Yes. -Yeah! Wait, really?"
00:12:24.327,00:12:30.833,"-Yes. -Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign from this agency in a long time!"
00:12:30.917,00:12:31.750,Yes.
00:12:31.834,00:12:38.216,"I'm not saying it should win an award, but it could be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples."
00:12:38.341,00:12:40.426,-Like an Appley or something! -Yes.
00:12:40.551,00:12:43.888,-Is there really an award called Appley? -Yes.
00:12:44.013,00:12:45.098,-Could we nominate me? -Yes.
00:12:45.223,00:12:46.683,Holy crap!
00:12:56.859,00:12:59.529,to make some real important science stuff.
00:13:02.115,00:13:04.492,Huh! I thought I entered the code right.
00:13:16.671,00:13:19.590,Because it looks like you're inside a simulation...
00:13:19.716,00:13:21.759,inside a simulation!
00:13:25.263,00:13:32.854,"Sir, the doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps-- Too loud, Cynthia. Too loud and too specific."
00:13:34.480,00:13:38.985,We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time.
00:13:39.110,00:13:44.198,"But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez."
00:13:44.574,00:13:47.702,All your most valuable secrets will now be ours!
00:13:47.826,00:13:50.955,"Until I get home before you and change the combination, you idiots."
00:13:51.080,00:13:53.708,That is why you're never getting home. Get them!
00:13:55.626,00:13:57.420,"-No! -Ugh, man!"
00:13:57.545,00:13:58.921,"Run, Morty!"
00:14:07.638,00:14:09.390,"Oh, my God!"
00:14:35.917,00:14:38.836,"This morning, I didn't even know this award existed."
00:14:38.961,00:14:40.963,"Now I'm holding one, and..."
00:14:42.882,00:14:50.640,"Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life, but, the truth is, it's more meaningful than that."
00:14:54.811,00:14:58.940,I am... finally complete!
00:15:08.533,00:15:09.951,What the hell?
00:15:13.246,00:15:14.372,No...
00:15:14.497,00:15:17.959,-Dad? -Why are you here dressed like a waiter?
00:15:18.084,00:15:19.627,"Screw it, we don't have time. C'mon."
00:15:19.919,00:15:21.087,No!
00:15:53.911,00:15:55.955,-Yes. -My man.
00:16:22.607,00:16:24.066,"Oh, man, they're hot on our tail!"
00:16:24.192,00:16:27.778,"-I guess they really do have dark matter. -But you know how to make it too, right?"
00:16:27.904,00:16:29.864,"Yeah, yeah. Check the engine room."
00:16:29.989,00:16:32.783,"We just need cesium, plutonic quarks, and bottled water."
00:16:35.620,00:16:38.748,"-It's all here, Rick! -Wow, lucky break! Grab that bucket."
00:16:38.873,00:16:42.210,"Okay, two parts plutonic quarks, one part cesium."
00:16:42.293,00:16:43.544,"Okay, uh-hu."
00:16:45.630,00:16:46.589,Alright.
00:16:46.714,00:16:53.304,Empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing? There's no time!
00:17:00.645,00:17:01.854,"Oh, no."
00:17:09.612,00:17:13.491,"Oh my God, Rick! How dumb are you?"
00:17:13.616,00:17:20.289,You're inside a simulation of a simulation inside another giant simulation!
00:17:24.293,00:17:27.713,"But we do now! We do now, sucker!"
00:17:27.838,00:17:32.301,"You simulated my grandson's genitalia, you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!"
00:17:32.426,00:17:35.179,Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.
00:17:35.304,00:17:38.224,You said you weren't gonna tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down?
00:17:38.349,00:17:41.602,"Alright, okay, great, wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?"
00:17:41.727,00:17:44.855,"-I don't know, can you? -Ha! Nice."
00:17:44.981,00:17:48.985,Okay. Show this gullible turd to a shuttle. I'm done with him.
00:17:49.360,00:17:51.404,"Oh, wait. Let me get a picture."
00:17:51.529,00:17:54.991,Look at his face. He's trying to figure out if he's in a simulation still.
00:18:03.749,00:18:08.337,"And by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps, that was part of the simulation."
00:18:08.462,00:18:10.923,"Sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?"
00:18:13.884,00:18:15.886,"Keep it. Move it up, actually, if you can."
00:18:20.891,00:18:22.226,"Jerry, don't worry about it."
00:18:22.351,00:18:26.772,So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity.
00:18:26.897,00:18:30.151,"You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride too."
00:18:30.276,00:18:34.447,You should have respect for the dummies of the universe now that you're one of us.
00:18:34.572,00:18:37.241,"Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right."
00:18:40.411,00:18:41.912,Alright everybody!
00:18:41.996,00:18:44.665,Two parts plutonic quarks...
00:18:45.041,00:18:48.002,one part cesium...
00:18:48.628,00:18:53.257,"And listen, I'm sorry for yelling earlier, I couldn't ask for a better staff."
00:18:53.382,00:18:56.677,I love you guys and I love all your families.
00:18:56.802,00:18:59.597,And the final ingredient...
00:19:02.266,00:19:05.311,Whoa! What the hell? What happened back there?
00:19:05.436,00:19:08.105,Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe?
00:19:52.566,00:19:54.610,"So, what do you think?"
00:19:55.611,00:19:56.570,You're fired.
00:20:00.658,00:20:03.369,"Well, then it was a terrible simulation. Get out."
00:20:07.206,00:20:11.001,"Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?"
00:20:16.716,00:20:18.342,"Geez, Rick. What are you doing?"
00:20:26.100,00:20:31.272,"You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, huh?"
00:20:31.397,00:20:36.360,"You're a real true hero, out in the field. You're a real trooper, huh, Morty?"
00:20:36.485,00:20:39.363,-Have you been drinking? -I really appreciate you.
00:20:39.488,00:20:41.574,"Okay, cool, alright, Rick..."
00:20:41.699,00:20:44.285,You little son of a bitch! Are you a simulation?
00:20:47.163,00:20:48.706,You little son of a bitch!
00:20:49.915,00:20:53.169,"-I'm sorry, Morty. You're a good kid. -Geez!"
00:20:53.294,00:20:56.088,"-You're a good kid. -Oh, my God!"
00:20:59.508,00:21:00.968,What a life.
00:00:40.541,00:00:41.542,Run!
00:00:44.461,00:00:48.549,-Do it! Hit the button now! -I can't do it. They're my family!
00:00:54.805,00:00:57.683,Do you need a mnemonic device? Just hit the button!
00:01:10.445,00:01:11.822,"Good work, Morty."
00:01:12.573,00:01:16.535,These demonic alien spirits are really valuable.
00:01:16.660,00:01:18.996,You okay? I told you not to trust that tuna.
00:01:19.121,00:01:21.873,I just killed my family! I don't care what they were.
00:01:21.999,00:01:24.585,Some people'd pay for that kind of breakthrough.
00:01:28.213,00:01:31.550,That was really traumatizing! I quit! I'm out!
00:01:31.675,00:01:35.304,"Come on, don't be like that. The universe is a crazy, chaotic place."
00:01:37.222,00:01:39.474,Adventures are supposed to be simple and fun.
00:01:39.600,00:01:43.186,"Oh, yeah, Morty. That's real easy to say from the sidekick position."
00:01:43.312,00:01:47.941,But how about next time you be in charge and then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is.
00:01:48.025,00:01:50.902,"Seriously, Rick? You'll let me call the shots?"
00:01:51.028,00:01:54.281,"Okay, yeah, fine, but let's make it interesting, Morty."
00:01:54.364,00:01:59.661,"If your adventure sucks and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures."
00:01:59.745,00:02:02.414,"-And you do my laundry for a month. -Alright, tough guy!"
00:02:02.539,00:02:05.584,"But if it's good, I get to be in charge of every third adventure!"
00:02:05.709,00:02:08.337,"-Every tenth. -Deal. Come on, let's get going."
00:02:08.462,00:02:11.506,-The dishwasher's doing that thing again. -Washing dishes?
00:02:11.590,00:02:15.636,-No. The opposite. Can you fix it? -Can you help me with my homework?
00:02:15.761,00:02:17.471,"-Yeah, just don't do it. -Grandpa!"
00:02:17.554,00:02:21.642,"Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar?"
00:02:21.767,00:02:25.562,"Hat trick. Morty, let's put a pin in this, I gotta help your pathetic family."
00:02:28.940,00:02:31.777,"Oh, you done did it this time. It's on."
00:02:31.860,00:02:34.529,I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart.
00:02:34.613,00:02:36.073,As for you ding dongs...
00:02:36.156,00:02:38.950,This is a Meeseeks Box. Let me show you how it works.
00:02:43.205,00:02:46.333,"You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid jar."
00:02:46.458,00:02:47.668,Yesiree!
00:02:47.793,00:02:51.380,-The Meeseeks fulfills the request... -All done!
00:02:51.505,00:02:54.883,"-...and then it stops existing. -Oh my God, he exploded!"
00:02:55.008,00:02:57.427,"Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out."
00:03:00.806,00:03:04.643,Alright! Everybody out of here now! I got a bet to win!
00:03:05.477,00:03:08.021,-So many possibilities... -My mind is racing.
00:03:08.146,00:03:11.900,"If we're going to use this thing, we need to keep it simple."
00:03:15.612,00:03:19.116,"-Summer, what did I just-- -I'm Mister Meeseeks! Look at me!"
00:03:19.241,00:03:24.413,"-I want to be a more complete woman! -Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!"
00:03:24.538,00:03:29.000,You guys are doing it wrong. He said simple.
00:03:32.754,00:03:36.591,"Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game."
00:03:36.717,00:03:41.680,"-Oh, yeah, can do! -Nailed it."
00:03:44.808,00:03:46.685,Why didn't we just go to Kentucky?
00:03:46.810,00:03:50.522,This is a fantasy type world with creatures and fantasy things.
00:03:50.647,00:03:53.400,"-We're going on a quest, okay? -Can't wait."
00:03:54.151,00:03:59.489,Ahem! Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!
00:03:59.614,00:04:02.909,"-Oh my God, so embarrassing. -At last! Two heroes!"
00:04:03.034,00:04:04.119,You must help us.
00:04:04.244,00:04:10.083,"This village is terribly poor, yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures."
00:04:10.375,00:04:14.880,"You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir! Kind sir."
00:04:15.005,00:04:17.257,"Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds."
00:04:23.180,00:04:27.893,is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives.
00:04:30.812,00:04:32.105,Thank you!
00:04:32.230,00:04:34.065,Mr. Meeseeks was it? Gene Vagina.
00:04:34.149,00:04:39.279,I'm in a bit of a custody thing with my ex and was wondering-- I'll get your info from Summer!
00:04:40.197,00:04:44.242,I got pregnant at seventeen. I still put myself through veterinary school.
00:04:44.409,00:04:55.879,"Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't-- I'm just saying, somewhere along the way, I lost that wide eyed girl from Muskegon."
00:05:02.052,00:05:06.389,"Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual."
00:05:06.515,00:05:10.101,You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you?
00:05:10.185,00:05:11.686,Be honest with them.
00:05:11.812,00:05:13.897,Even if it means setting them free.
00:05:14.648,00:05:17.901,You're saying I should leave Jerry.
00:05:18.026,00:05:22.030,I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation.
00:05:47.138,00:05:50.100,That's okay. I'm Mister Meeseeks! Look at me!
00:05:50.225,00:05:52.227,Try again and keep your head down.
00:05:52.351,00:05:55.230,"Okay, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down?"
00:05:55.313,00:05:59.067,"Well, it's both. But most importantly you got to relax."
00:05:59.192,00:06:02.612,You know what? I don't think this is working. I give up.
00:06:02.737,00:06:05.282,"I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that."
00:06:05.407,00:06:10.369,I'm Mister Meeseeks. I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me!
00:06:10.495,00:06:12.873,"Well make yourself comfortable, because I suck."
00:06:12.998,00:06:17.252,"No, Jerry, I'm the one who sucks! Let me try something."
00:06:17.376,00:06:22.507,-I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! -Hi! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.
00:06:25.969,00:06:30.389,Can do! I'm Mister Meeseeks! Is he keeping his shoulders squared?
00:06:30.515,00:06:32.309,"Oh, he's trying!"
00:06:38.189,00:06:42.110,"Alright, we're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next?"
00:06:42.235,00:06:45.447,"Relax, Rick. All we gotta do is find the treasure room."
00:06:45.572,00:06:46.698,It's nice and simple.
00:06:46.781,00:06:50.493,I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously.
00:06:52.287,00:06:55.665,"Uh-oh! Start'n to get a little hairy. What do you wanna do, boss?"
00:07:02.088,00:07:06.051,"Give up. This is game over. I'll take us home right now, you just say the word."
00:07:06.176,00:07:10.597,"No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it."
00:07:10.722,00:07:12.849,I smell the blood of-- Whoop!
00:07:13.934,00:07:15.018,Holy crap!
00:07:15.602,00:07:19.105,He looks pretty bad down there. Looks like he's bleeding out.
00:07:22.108,00:07:23.693,You sons of bitches!
00:07:25.111,00:07:28.615,911? My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He's dying!
00:07:31.952,00:07:38.333,"We get it. You're little, down on your luck, and you think: He's a giant. Why don't we break into his home and murder him?."
00:07:38.416,00:07:43.171,-But that's not how it went down! -You're both going down like that.
00:07:43.296,00:07:45.924,"Oh, boy, you're really showing me how it's done."
00:07:48.718,00:07:52.430,"Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you."
00:07:52.555,00:07:55.392,The most important love you can receive is from yourself.
00:07:55.475,00:08:00.063,"-You gotta just choke up on the club! -Which is it, choke up or follow-through?"
00:08:00.188,00:08:04.150,"Come on, Jerry, we've been over this, you know you gotta do both."
00:08:04.275,00:08:06.903,This is as frustrating for us as it is for you!
00:08:06.987,00:08:09.030,That just puts pressure on me!
00:08:13.201,00:08:15.161,It is a paradox!
00:08:16.204,00:08:18.581,"These Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful."
00:08:18.665,00:08:21.042,I can't imagine what you must be going through.
00:08:21.126,00:08:24.337,-Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours. -You're kidding me.
00:08:24.421,00:08:28.091,-Notice anything different? -I'm sorry. Hours?
00:08:28.216,00:08:32.512,"Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her!"
00:08:32.595,00:08:34.014,-Uh... -Jerry?
00:08:34.097,00:08:36.516,You mind if we get back to the task at hand?
00:08:36.725,00:08:39.144,Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long.
00:08:39.227,00:08:40.812,It's getting weird.
00:08:41.521,00:08:42.939,Order in the court!
00:08:43.064,00:08:49.029,"Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty."
00:08:49.154,00:08:52.073,"Great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to Giant Prison."
00:08:52.157,00:08:56.161,"If somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines."
00:08:56.244,00:08:58.580,It'll be really easy to rape us after that.
00:08:58.705,00:08:59.998,"We're gonna be okay, Rick."
00:09:00.081,00:09:01.958,How? They took my portal gun.
00:09:02.083,00:09:03.960,This is an open and shut case.
00:09:04.044,00:09:10.175,You think some magical angel is going to show up and then-- Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties!
00:09:10.508,00:09:16.181,"Your honor, I'm from a tiny person's advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss."
00:09:16.306,00:09:21.352,These little men were never read their rights and are therefore free fi to fo home.
00:09:21.603,00:09:24.397,-What the hell is he talking about? -They're free to go.
00:09:32.447,00:09:33.656,We did it!
00:09:34.199,00:09:37.577,"Looks like the portal gun's still working, you ready to head home?"
00:09:37.660,00:09:41.623,"You'd like that, wouldn't you? Well, we're not bailing out just yet."
00:09:41.748,00:09:46.252,We're gonna go find some treasure or something and bring it to those villagers.
00:09:46.377,00:09:49.047,"Morty, cut your losses, this is obviously a wash."
00:09:49.172,00:09:55.470,"Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, walking down the courthouse steps."
00:09:57.388,00:09:58.681,"Oh, boy, Morty!"
00:09:58.807,00:10:02.143,"Usually, walking down the steps is the easy part of the adventure."
00:10:02.268,00:10:06.272,"-What do you say, Morty? -I say: Give me a hand, sidekick."
00:10:10.902,00:10:13.696,Everybody shut up! Let me try!
00:10:15.740,00:10:18.243,Damn it! Damn it!
00:10:18.368,00:10:20.078,"-I'm going out. -Wait, what?"
00:10:20.203,00:10:22.872,"Well, you're busy, I'm hungry, I thought I'd go out."
00:10:22.956,00:10:25.250,Do you want me to be happy or in prison?
00:10:25.333,00:10:28.711,"Whoa, whoa! Where in the hell is-- I'll take you to dinner."
00:10:30.004,00:10:33.216,You know what? It's hard being me too. I'll be right there.
00:10:34.884,00:10:36.678,I've got a marriage to keep together.
00:10:36.761,00:10:40.223,"At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine."
00:10:44.561,00:10:48.481,"-We all want to die, we're Meeseeks! -Why did you even rope me into this?"
00:10:48.606,00:10:52.527,"-'Cause he roped me into this! -Him over there, he roped me into this!"
00:10:52.652,00:10:56.239,-Well he roped me into this! -What about me? He roped me into this!
00:10:56.364,00:10:59.826,"-That one of there, roped me into this. -Well, he roped me into this!"
00:11:01.995,00:11:04.664,This is the part everybody loves.
00:11:04.831,00:11:07.709,Scaling down 650.000 oversized steps.
00:11:07.834,00:11:12.088,"Alright, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid."
00:11:12.213,00:11:14.883,"Hey, Rick, what do you know, look down there."
00:11:14.966,00:11:18.303,Looks like some kinda tavern built right into the side of the step!
00:11:19.596,00:11:23.308,"Oh, wow, Rick! Now this is more like it!"
00:11:23.433,00:11:27.729,"Look, there's little staircase people in here. All kinds of crazy characters."
00:11:27.854,00:11:31.733,"This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun."
00:11:35.445,00:11:38.740,"Pay them no mind, those stair goblins can be moody."
00:11:38.865,00:11:40.491,What can I getcha?
00:11:40.617,00:11:49.542,"We've got Skarlog Poppies, Flurlow, Halzingers, -Bloogies, Juicy Time babies... -Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:49.667,00:11:53.421,You got any Scotch whiskey around here? Or just a buncha nonsense words?
00:11:56.424,00:12:00.303,"And we were wondering, is there a faster way we could get down these stairs?"
00:12:00.428,00:12:05.516,Y'all need to ride down the stairs? My name is Slippely-Slippery Stair!
00:12:06.351,00:12:09.604,I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels.
00:12:09.854,00:12:13.816,25 shmeckels? I don't know how much that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little?
00:12:13.942,00:12:16.903,That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.
00:12:17.028,00:12:20.323,"Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels."
00:12:20.448,00:12:23.618,"It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline."
00:12:23.701,00:12:25.370,Rats! What a shame.
00:12:25.495,00:12:28.747,"Your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out."
00:12:28.873,00:12:31.167,You keep heckling my adventure! You know why?
00:12:31.292,00:12:34.045,-Because it's lame? -It's because you're petty!
00:12:34.170,00:12:37.966,How many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap?
00:12:38.091,00:12:40.969,"I always roll with the punches, Rick, why can't you?"
00:12:41.094,00:12:46.808,"I gotta take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!"
00:12:46.933,00:12:48.101,Whatever.
00:12:48.226,00:12:56.734,"It's become clear, look at me, that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow through, we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeseeks!"
00:12:56.859,00:12:58.403,"I'm Mr. Meeseeks, look at me."
00:12:58.486,00:13:02.323,"The only thing that's clear, is that choking up is the one true solution."
00:13:02.448,00:13:04.325,"Look at me, I'm Mr. Meeseeks."
00:13:04.450,00:13:11.291,"I've been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing's worked. I fear the worst!"
00:13:11.416,00:13:15.794,"Your failures are your own, old man. I'm Mister Meeseeks! Look at me."
00:13:15.920,00:13:19.007,I say follow through! Who's with me?
00:13:32.145,00:13:35.814,"Hi, Mister Jelly Bean. I'm Morty. My Grandpa and I are on an adventure."
00:13:35.940,00:13:39.193,"-Nice, is it a fun adventure? -I hope so."
00:13:39.319,00:13:42.572,But I'm starting to get nervous that it's gone too far off the rails.
00:13:42.655,00:13:46.909,"-Isn't that what adventures do? -Hey, you know what? You're right!"
00:13:47.201,00:13:48.536,Everything's going fine.
00:13:48.661,00:13:51.289,I just gotta relax and go with the flow.
00:13:51.372,00:13:52.415,Yeah!
00:13:58.588,00:14:01.758,"Stop, you're making me really uncomfortable."
00:14:01.883,00:14:05.428,-Stop fighting me. Just let this happen. -Get off of me!
00:14:46.761,00:14:50.932,"My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks' blood."
00:14:51.057,00:14:53.851,None of us can die until our job is done.
00:14:53.976,00:14:57.313,The job can't be done! We'll never get two strokes off his game!
00:14:57.438,00:15:01.901,No we won't. But we will get all strokes off his game.
00:15:04.278,00:15:06.197,When we kill him!
00:15:08.658,00:15:12.036,"Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about."
00:15:12.370,00:15:13.746,Where would you go?
00:15:13.830,00:15:17.500,"I don't know, man. Italy, Greece, Argentina..."
00:15:22.713,00:15:25.591,Did I tell you how much I love your new hair cut?
00:15:27.802,00:15:28.845,There he is!
00:15:32.014,00:15:33.349,"Run, Jerry!"
00:15:37.270,00:15:38.354,"Come on out, Jerry!"
00:15:42.108,00:15:44.652,"Oh, we're well past that, Jerry."
00:15:45.194,00:15:50.950,"Come on, Rick, quit stalling. Whattaya got?"
00:15:51.075,00:15:53.119,"Read 'em and weep, fellas!"
00:15:53.453,00:15:57.790,"Hey, Morty. Listen, I'm sorry about all that stuff I said about your adventure."
00:15:57.915,00:16:00.418,"I'm havin' a good time, Morty. It's not so bad."
00:16:00.543,00:16:03.588,Let's just go home. I'm calling it. The adventure's over.
00:16:03.671,00:16:08.009,-We can't leave now. I'm on fire! -I want to leave now. You win the bet.
00:16:08.134,00:16:11.345,"Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please."
00:16:15.683,00:16:18.311,"Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels."
00:16:18.394,00:16:26.152,"Why don't we pay Slippery Stair here for a ride back to the village, -and we give the rest to the villagers? -Really?"
00:16:26.277,00:16:29.780,"Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure, needs a good ending."
00:16:37.413,00:16:41.459,"Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry."
00:16:41.626,00:16:47.423,We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill!
00:16:47.548,00:16:50.760,"Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry."
00:16:50.843,00:16:53.638,We will do anything to alleviate that pain.
00:16:53.804,00:16:55.890,"Just ask! What's your name, ma'am?"
00:16:56.015,00:16:57.099,Samantha.
00:17:00.895,00:17:03.856,Innocent people are going to die because of me.
00:17:03.940,00:17:06.192,Why am I so mediocre?
00:17:08.611,00:17:10.738,"Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back."
00:17:10.821,00:17:12.490,Bend your knees. Bend them!
00:17:12.615,00:17:15.952,Square your shoulders. Now take a deep breath.
00:17:19.372,00:17:21.791,"I'm counting to three, Jerry."
00:17:40.685,00:17:43.229,That's a lower handicap stroke!
00:17:47.733,00:17:50.570,Excuse me. I'm a bit of a Stickler Meeseeks.
00:17:50.653,00:17:52.196,What about your short game?
00:18:02.707,00:18:04.458,"Wow, nice!"
00:18:09.672,00:18:13.384,"-I think we'll take our food to go. -No, you won't. The police are coming."
00:18:22.727,00:18:27.481,"Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved. You are both true heroes!"
00:18:30.985,00:18:33.446,"Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet."
00:18:33.571,00:18:35.740,"Thanks, but I don't know if I should."
00:18:35.823,00:18:39.493,You were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place.
00:18:39.619,00:18:43.205,Maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then.
00:18:43.331,00:18:46.334,"This one's wrapped up neat and clean, 'cause we did it Morty style."
00:18:46.959,00:18:52.673,"Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king, so that he may thank you personally."
00:18:53.049,00:18:54.550,"Uh, no, it's cool!"
00:18:55.009,00:18:56.385,Rick. Portal. Hurry.
00:19:09.899,00:19:13.527,So... you still thinking about taking that trip?
00:19:18.532,00:19:25.915,"When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with: willing to say anything to complete their task."
00:19:26.040,00:19:27.541,Was I one of those guys?
00:19:27.625,00:19:30.795,The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards.
00:19:30.920,00:19:33.089,Well... I got you pregnant.
00:19:35.841,00:19:38.969,-What the hell happened to this place? -Your Meeseeks Box happened.
00:19:39.095,00:19:43.182,They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game.
00:19:43.808,00:19:45.893,It's not my fault Jerry's an idiot.
00:19:46.102,00:19:48.729,Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?
00:19:48.854,00:19:52.483,"-Well, I do have a Fleeseeks box... -No. No more boxes."
00:19:52.608,00:19:56.320,What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dubs!
00:19:58.447,00:20:01.200,That's my new thing! I'm kind of like... Arsenio!
00:20:01.325,00:20:05.287,That's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops!
00:20:05.413,00:20:07.873,"-See you next week, everybody. -I don't get it."
00:20:39.822,00:20:42.950,"Sir, I think you're going to want to see this."
00:20:43.075,00:20:46.871,We found it inside a lock box inside King Jelly Bean's closet.
00:20:48.372,00:20:50.291,-We have to tell the people. -Wait.
00:20:51.751,00:20:53.210,Destroy it.
00:20:59.008,00:21:05.389,Our people will get more from the idea he represented than from the jellybean he actually was.
00:00:39.414,00:00:41.208,"don't let the name fool you, I'm in charge."
00:00:41.333,00:00:44.795,Reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance.
00:00:44.920,00:00:48.173,"I insist: if you have the flu, stay home."
00:00:48.257,00:00:52.094,"The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration."
00:00:52.219,00:00:54.054,You don't bring dead babies to Passover.
00:00:58.892,00:01:00.561,"-Uh... -What's up, Morty?"
00:01:00.978,00:01:02.521,-What are you doing? -Um...
00:01:02.646,00:01:05.774,"Wait, were you about to talk... to her?"
00:01:05.899,00:01:08.277,"Well, I mean, I was thinking about it..."
00:01:08.402,00:01:12.114,Dude. Stay in your league. Look at how hot she is.
00:01:16.368,00:01:17.578,"Gee, thanks, Brad."
00:01:17.703,00:01:20.455,I throw balls far. You want good words?
00:01:20.581,00:01:22.541,Date a languager.
00:01:25.377,00:01:29.840,"There's not a premium on that, but you'll be getting girls some time after Brad's out of shape."
00:01:29.965,00:01:34.011,"You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls. I want Jessica."
00:01:34.136,00:01:39.391,"Ah, well. I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom."
00:01:39.474,00:01:40.976,And that's not an urban diss.
00:01:41.100,00:01:44.438,"Your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought..."
00:01:44.563,00:01:46.690,"I should get her pregnant, and she'll marry me."
00:01:46.815,00:01:48.900,"I beg your pardon, Rick. Inappropriate."
00:01:49.026,00:01:52.362,"Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school."
00:01:52.487,00:01:56.783,I'm not sure you want his romantic advice. His marriage is hanging from a thread.
00:01:56.908,00:01:59.077,"My marriage is fine, thank you."
00:01:59.202,00:02:04.416,"It's your house, whatever you say it is how it is, but even a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door."
00:02:04.499,00:02:06.627,I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.
00:02:06.752,00:02:09.004,Don't talk about my parents like that!
00:02:09.087,00:02:14.718,"Listen, I hate to break it to you, but love is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed."
00:02:14.843,00:02:19.640,"It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage."
00:02:19.765,00:02:23.435,I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle. Rise above.
00:02:23.560,00:02:25.896,Focus on science.
00:02:27.105,00:02:29.858,"Well, I'm going to go get dressed for the dance."
00:02:29.941,00:02:33.528,"Yeah, I'm just going to... check on your mom."
00:02:36.073,00:02:38.241,"Morty, hand me that screwdriver."
00:02:41.745,00:02:42.871,"Hey, listen, Rick."
00:02:42.954,00:02:46.667,You know how you said that love is a chemical and all that stuff?
00:02:46.792,00:02:48.210,I was thinking...
00:02:48.293,00:02:52.297,could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind?
00:02:52.422,00:02:54.841,So where she falls in love with me?
00:02:57.552,00:03:01.473,"That's such a poor use of my time. It's beneath me, hand me the screwdriver."
00:03:01.598,00:03:04.309,"No, Rick, I'm not going to hand you the screwdriver!"
00:03:04.434,00:03:06.770,I'm not going to hand you anything ever again!
00:03:06.895,00:03:09.106,I'm always helping you with everything!
00:03:09.231,00:03:11.441,"What about me, Rick?"
00:03:11.566,00:03:14.611,Why can't you just help me out for once?
00:03:17.114,00:03:19.908,You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass.
00:03:20.033,00:03:23.453,"Listen, this is called Oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole."
00:03:23.578,00:03:28.458,"Do you know what a vole is, Morty? It's a rodent that mates for life."
00:03:28.583,00:03:32.462,This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain that makes it fall in love.
00:03:35.340,00:03:36.675,"Oh, well, okay..."
00:03:36.842,00:03:40.971,"A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs. This isn't Game Of Thrones."
00:03:42.055,00:03:46.226,"Whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever."
00:03:46.351,00:03:50.063,"-Are ya happy now, Morty? -Heck yeah! Thank you, grandpa Rick!"
00:03:53.567,00:03:57.279,"What am I, a hack? Go nuts, Morty, it's foolproof."
00:04:03.326,00:04:07.372,"-Beth, do you still love me? -Ugh, what kind of question is that?"
00:04:07.497,00:04:09.207,The yes or no kind?
00:04:09.332,00:04:11.918,"Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?"
00:04:12.043,00:04:13.003,Yes.
00:04:13.128,00:04:15.172,-Are you going to build them? -No.
00:04:15.255,00:04:16.923,Then what good was the yes?
00:04:17.007,00:04:19.760,"Wait, is loving me the house or the homeless people?"
00:04:19.885,00:04:22.971,"Loving you is work, Jerry. Hard work."
00:04:23.054,00:04:24.681,Like building a homeless shelter.
00:04:24.806,00:04:27.934,"Nobody wants to say no, but some people put the work in."
00:04:28.059,00:04:30.479,So what do you say? Do you see me working here?
00:04:30.604,00:04:34.107,-This conversation seem tedious to me? -Sort of.
00:04:34.232,00:04:36.651,"Then I obviously sort of love you, don't I?"
00:04:39.696,00:04:42.282,-They need me at the horse hospital. -This late?
00:04:42.407,00:04:48.079,"The race track had a starlight derby, there was a seven horse collision and Davin's there alone."
00:04:51.416,00:04:55.545,Davin... Davin... Davin!
00:05:10.685,00:05:13.188,"Hey there, Jessica! Whoa, oh, whoopsie!"
00:05:19.986,00:05:21.446,"Wow, thanks!"
00:05:21.530,00:05:24.866,"I love you, Morty. I love you so much it burns!"
00:05:24.991,00:05:26.034,"Oh, man!"
00:05:26.117,00:05:28.745,"I love you too, Jessica!"
00:05:28.870,00:05:31.998,"-Is this punk bothering you? -Leave him alone, jerk!"
00:05:32.123,00:05:33.416,I'm in love with him!
00:05:33.667,00:05:36.419,He's more man than you will ever be!
00:05:43.927,00:05:45.679,"Oh man, Morty..."
00:05:45.804,00:05:49.432,"-I'm really sorry. -Oh, well... No problem, Brad."
00:05:49.558,00:05:52.811,"There's something special about you, Morty. So special."
00:05:52.936,00:05:55.397,-Whoa! Take it easy! -Get your hands off of him!
00:05:55.522,00:05:57.732,Back off! I'm try'n to be with my man!
00:05:57.858,00:06:02.195,"That's enough, Bradley. We don't want you injuring your ballthrowing arm."
00:06:02.320,00:06:04.489,"Never leave me, Morty. Never."
00:06:04.614,00:06:08.326,"Uh, sure, I mean... of course not."
00:06:08.451,00:06:11.705,-What do you think that was all about? -Who cares. Just hold me.
00:06:15.458,00:06:16.960,Let go of me!
00:06:17.586,00:06:18.587,Morty!
00:06:24.426,00:06:28.680,-She's gonna be alone with him all night. -Digging around the insides of horses.
00:06:28.805,00:06:30.307,It's not a very romantic setting.
00:06:30.389,00:06:33.560,There's always the possibility that she made the whole thing up.
00:06:33.643,00:06:35.687,Maybe Davin's digging around in her insides.
00:06:35.812,00:06:38.648,Grandpa! So gross! You're talking about my mom!
00:06:38.732,00:06:41.526,"Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you."
00:06:41.610,00:06:44.613,Or family means nothing. In which case don't play that card.
00:06:44.738,00:06:48.825,"-She's not responding to my texts. -Careful, dad. Jealousy turns women off."
00:06:48.950,00:06:52.370,"-Well isn't that convenient. -Not for the men they cheat on, no."
00:06:52.495,00:06:56.082,Okay. I'm going to go out. For some ice cream.
00:06:56.207,00:07:01.087,And maybe stop by the hospital. To support my wife. With my confidence.
00:07:02.213,00:07:04.341,"God, grandpa, you're such a dick."
00:07:04.466,00:07:07.093,"I'm sorry, your opinion means very little to me."
00:07:07.177,00:07:09.554,How come you're not at this stupid dance?
00:07:09.638,00:07:12.307,Screw that. I don't want to get sick. It's flu season.
00:07:12.390,00:07:13.433,-It is? -Yeah.
00:07:13.642,00:07:14.643,Uh oh.
00:07:20.565,00:07:22.192,Please just let this work out.
00:07:22.317,00:07:24.986,"Do it, Morty. Do it!"
00:07:29.282,00:07:31.826,Um... can we maybe go somewhere more private?
00:07:31.952,00:07:34.204,"Jessica, get ahold of yourself."
00:07:36.081,00:07:38.416,You don't deserve to carry Morty's genes.
00:07:48.343,00:07:49.511,"Oh, crap..."
00:07:55.350,00:07:56.935,"Come on, we gotta get you out of here!"
00:07:57.060,00:08:00.271,"You're not going to believe this, but I made a mistake!"
00:08:03.858,00:08:06.403,"-Morty, are you okay? -I'm fine."
00:08:06.569,00:08:07.529,"Oh, good."
00:08:07.612,00:08:10.198,"If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself."
00:08:10.365,00:08:12.033,"I love you bad, Mo-mo!"
00:08:15.954,00:08:21.543,The principal and I have discussed it and we're both insecure enough to agree to a threeway.
00:08:25.630,00:08:28.758,I didn't realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu.
00:08:28.842,00:08:31.928,"You know, that might have been valuable information for me."
00:08:32.053,00:08:33.346,What the hell is going on?
00:08:33.430,00:08:36.474,What does it look like? The serum is piggybacking on the virus.
00:08:36.599,00:08:37.976,It's gone airborne.
00:08:38.101,00:08:40.353,"Oh, crap! What're we gonna do, Rick?"
00:08:40.478,00:08:42.022,It's gonna be fine. Relax.
00:08:42.105,00:08:45.400,I whipped up an antidote. It's based on praying mantis DNA.
00:08:45.567,00:08:48.111,Praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles.
00:08:48.236,00:08:50.822,They mate once and then decapitate the partner.
00:08:50.947,00:08:54.117,"It's a whole ritual, it's gruesome and totally opposite."
00:08:54.200,00:08:55.493,There's no love of at all.
00:08:55.577,00:08:58.371,I basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus.
00:09:00.749,00:09:02.417,It'll all be over very shortly.
00:09:07.172,00:09:11.259,"I know you didn't ask, but I'm not interested in having sex with you."
00:09:11.384,00:09:14.262,These serums don't work on anybody related to you genetically.
00:09:28.234,00:09:32.030,"Okay, well. Sometimes science is more art than science, Morty."
00:09:32.155,00:09:33.615,A lot of people don't get that.
00:09:37.118,00:09:38.119,What--?
00:09:40.872,00:09:42.749,Come on are you kidding me?
00:09:42.832,00:09:43.875,Hello!
00:09:45.627,00:09:48.213,You're not Morty! Bring us Morty!
00:09:57.388,00:10:02.060,Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.
00:10:06.314,00:10:07.774,What's the worst that could happen?
00:10:07.899,00:10:10.693,We interrupt Pregnant Baby with breaking news.
00:10:10.777,00:10:12.070,"Aw, come on!"
00:10:15.323,00:10:16.282,What the hell?
00:10:16.407,00:10:19.369,The only thing that is known is how cute he is.
00:10:24.582,00:10:27.794,"-I love him more than you do, Harold! -You wish, stupid bitch!"
00:10:27.877,00:10:30.672,-Morty's mine! -No! Morty's mine!
00:10:58.783,00:11:01.911,It's wild how fast that spread. I've really outdone myself.
00:11:02.036,00:11:03.037,Outdone yourself?
00:11:06.541,00:11:10.378,Not only do they want to have sex with me but now they want to eat me afterwards!
00:11:10.503,00:11:14.048,I don't know what I was thinking. Mantises are the opposite of voles?
00:11:14.132,00:11:16.509,Obviously DNA is more complicated than that.
00:11:16.634,00:11:19.095,"This right here is gonna do the trick, baby."
00:11:19.220,00:11:26.144,"It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever and just a smidge of dinosaur."
00:11:26.269,00:11:27.937,Should add up to normal humanity.
00:11:28.062,00:11:29.772,That doesn't make any sense!
00:11:29.898,00:11:31.858,How does that add up to normal humanity?
00:11:31.983,00:11:33.860,"What, you want me to show you my math?"
00:11:33.943,00:11:37.197,Are you the scientist or the kid that wanted to get laid?
00:11:44.287,00:11:48.124,-Yeah it's satisfying work. -It's more than the work.
00:11:48.249,00:11:52.629,"I love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world."
00:11:52.754,00:11:54.756,It's the only time I can really think.
00:11:54.881,00:11:56.257,And feel.
00:11:58.092,00:12:00.929,-What are you doing? -I'm playing African dream pop.
00:12:01.054,00:12:03.514,What do you do after a long night?
00:12:04.766,00:12:05.892,Oh! Uh...
00:12:09.979,00:12:11.689,"-Beth? -What is it, Davin?"
00:12:16.569,00:12:19.280,...what it was like to give your son a bath.
00:12:19.405,00:12:24.077,-What? -What does Morty's skin smell like?
00:12:24.202,00:12:28.831,How soft-- How soft are his privates?
00:12:28.957,00:12:30.749,"Let go of me, Davin!"
00:12:37.131,00:12:39.175,Take me to Morty.
00:12:40.176,00:12:41.970,You're not Morty.
00:12:42.303,00:12:46.849,"No, I'm Mister Crowbar. And this is my friend."
00:12:46.975,00:12:49.310,Who is also a crowbar.
00:12:49.477,00:12:50.937,That's stupid.
00:12:54.399,00:12:56.651,Yeah? Well look where being smart got you.
00:12:56.775,00:12:59.946,-Jerry! Thank God! -God?
00:13:00.071,00:13:03.199,"God's turning people into insect monsters, Beth."
00:13:03.324,00:13:06.411,I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me.
00:13:06.536,00:13:08.413,"Thank you, Jerry. Thank you."
00:13:13.710,00:13:15.712,Take a good look down there and soak it in.
00:13:19.132,00:13:22.176,"-Just do it already! -Technically, there's no rush."
00:13:22.302,00:13:24.971,"Once it's fixed, it's done, it's fixed."
00:13:25.096,00:13:27.806,We could just enjoy it for a little bit.
00:13:27.890,00:13:29.767,"I mean, look at how crazy it is."
00:13:29.892,00:13:33.980,When's the next time you're gonna see something like this? Soak it in.
00:13:34.063,00:13:36.065,It's pretty neat. It's pretty interesting.
00:13:36.149,00:13:37.942,"That's it, I'm pulling the lever."
00:13:44.699,00:13:48.202,"What do we have here? Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh?"
00:13:48.286,00:13:50.997,"I bet you feel pretty stupid right now, huh?"
00:13:51.122,00:13:55.251,"Like the world's smallest man, that you were doubting me about this whole thing."
00:13:55.376,00:13:57.211,"Oh, Rick, something's not right!"
00:13:57.295,00:14:02.050,"-Yeah, you. You're not right. Ever. -No, no! Look, you idiot!"
00:14:26.657,00:14:30.161,I bet you're loving this. This must be the best day of your life.
00:14:30.286,00:14:33.331,You get to be the mayor of I-told-you-town.
00:14:34.332,00:14:35.500,You're welcome.
00:14:45.009,00:14:46.302,Hold on.
00:15:05.655,00:15:07.907,I wish that shotgun was my penis.
00:15:08.032,00:15:11.035,"If it were, you could call me Ernest Hemingway."
00:15:11.160,00:15:13.663,I don't get it and I don't need to.
00:15:20.878,00:15:22.672,-Where's Morty? -I don't know.
00:15:22.797,00:15:24.966,Do you think grandpa had something to do with this?
00:15:25.091,00:15:27.510,"-It's not fair to assume that. -Oh, not fair?"
00:15:27.635,00:15:32.265,"Give me a break. He is a selfish, irresponsible ass and he left my mother."
00:15:32.390,00:15:35.518,A real man stands by his woman.
00:15:40.648,00:15:42.650,Tchoo tchoo-tchoo...
00:15:43.067,00:15:45.528,"I really Cronenberged the world up, didn't I?"
00:15:45.736,00:15:49.615,We got a whole planet of Cronenbergs walking around down there.
00:15:49.740,00:15:52.952,At least they're not in love with you anymore. That's a huge step.
00:15:53.077,00:15:57.832,"Oh my god, it's a living nightmare! How could you be so irresponsible?"
00:15:57.957,00:16:01.878,Me irresponsible? All I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver.
00:16:02.003,00:16:11.179,"You're the one who wanted me to buckle down and make you up a roofie juice serum, so you could roofie that poor girl at your school."
00:16:11.429,00:16:13.473,"Are you kidding me, Morty?"
00:16:13.598,00:16:16.225,You're gonna try to take the high road on this one?
00:16:16.350,00:16:20.354,"You're a little creep, Morty. You're just a little creepy creep person."
00:16:20.480,00:16:23.649,I should have listened to you when you refused to make the serum.
00:16:23.774,00:16:28.946,"I'm willing to accept my part of the blame, but you gotta accept your part of the blame!"
00:16:29.280,00:16:31.365,I'm not the one who fouled up the serum.
00:16:31.449,00:16:38.456,I'm not the one who haphazardly mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of Cronenbergs. You gotta fix this!
00:16:38.581,00:16:39.749,"Alright, Morty."
00:16:39.832,00:16:47.798,"We are in a pretty deep hole here, but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that'll put everything back to normal. Relatively speaking."
00:16:47.924,00:16:50.927,"Here, put this on while I do a little bit of scouting."
00:17:04.440,00:17:08.319,"Wow, Rick, I gotta say. You really pulled a rabbit out your hat this time."
00:17:08.861,00:17:12.782,"I thought the whole place was gonna be messed up for good, but here you did it!"
00:17:12.907,00:17:16.577,You figured out that crazy solution like you always do.
00:17:18.496,00:17:23.417,"C'mon, luck had nothing to do with it. I'm great, that's the real reason."
00:17:24.710,00:17:29.215,"Now, Morty, will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic desdefibulizer?"
00:17:29.340,00:17:31.759,"Sure thing, Rick. Here's a screwdriver."
00:17:31.884,00:17:35.596,"Alright, thank you very much. I got one screw turn."
00:17:35.721,00:17:38.349,And two screw turns!
00:17:43.813,00:17:44.939,"Alright, here we are."
00:17:48.734,00:17:50.695,What is going on? I'm freaking out!
00:17:50.820,00:17:54.532,"-Calm down, Morty. Look at me. -Oh my God! I can't take it!"
00:17:54.657,00:17:57.910,"-Calm yourself, Morty! -This can't be real!"
00:17:58.035,00:18:01.789,"-Will you listen to me, Morty? - It's you and me! We're ripped apart!"
00:18:01.914,00:18:04.750,Shut up and listen to me! It's fine! Everything is fine!
00:18:04.875,00:18:06.836,There's an infinite number of realities.
00:18:06.961,00:18:10.047,"And in a few dozen of those, I turned everything back to normal."
00:18:10.172,00:18:14.093,I just had to find one in which we also happened to both die around this time.
00:18:14.218,00:18:18.681,Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality.
00:18:18.806,00:18:21.475,We're not skipping a beat. Help me with these bodies.
00:18:21.601,00:18:22.643,This is insane.
00:18:22.768,00:18:24.979,"I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, OK?"
00:18:25.062,00:18:28.190,"That seems fair to me, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up."
00:18:28.274,00:18:30.693,Rick! What about the reality we left behind?
00:18:30.818,00:18:33.112,What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer?
00:18:33.237,00:18:34.905,Don't think about it.
00:18:34.989,00:18:38.534,"It's not like we can do this every week. We get three or four more of these, tops."
00:18:38.701,00:18:42.079,Now pick up your dead self and come on. Haste makes waste.
00:18:42.204,00:18:49.712,"I don't suppose you've considered this, but if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did, we'd be these guys right now. So, again, you're welcome."
00:20:29.520,00:20:31.939,he's got lifeless eyes.
00:20:32.064,00:20:34.316,Black eyes like a doll's eyes.
00:20:34.442,00:20:41.323,"When he comes at ya, he doesn't seem to be living until he bites ya and then, the blood and the red and the water..."
00:20:41.449,00:20:43.909,Do you ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?
00:20:44.034,00:20:48.456,"Sometimes. But I'm ashamed to admit, now that they're gone..."
00:20:48.581,00:20:51.083,I'm finally happy.
00:20:53.294,00:20:54.962,"Here we are, Cronenberg Morty."
00:20:55.087,00:20:57.923,A reality where everyone got genetically Cronenberged.
00:20:58.048,00:21:02.011,"We'll fit right in, Morty. It'll be like we never even left Cronenberg world."
00:21:02.136,00:21:05.055,"Yeah, Rick, but I'm gonna miss Cronenberg world."
00:21:05.181,00:21:08.684,Because everyone was Cronenberged all along like us from the beginning.
00:21:08.809,00:21:16.317,"I wish we hadn't genetically ruined Cronenberg world beyond repair and turned everyone into regular, normal people, just walking around..."
00:21:16.442,00:21:19.361,Don't you worry about that sorta thing.
00:21:19.570,00:21:21.822,"Let's go make ourselves at home, huh?"
00:00:10.928,00:00:13.680,That is multiphase quantum resonator.
00:00:13.889,00:00:15.516,-Well does it defraculate? -Fuck no.
00:00:15.724,00:00:17.351,Then it's a broken defraculator.
00:00:17.434,00:00:19.811,Like you would even know dick about fraculation.
00:00:25.609,00:00:30.113,"So, let's say 60 smidgens and I'll tell you what, I'll do you a favor: I'll throw in a fart."
00:00:30.197,00:00:34.326,"Hey, Rick, you think maybe I could get something from this place?"
00:00:34.451,00:00:37.788,"Like a souvenir? Like just to have, like something cool, you know?"
00:00:37.871,00:00:41.792,"Not here, Morty, we'll stop somewhere else, because, you know, there's always another pawn shop."
00:00:42.125,00:00:44.043,"Oh, okay, I just..."
00:00:44.127,00:00:47.172,"you know, I thought that robot over there looked pretty cool, you know."
00:00:47.297,00:00:49.800,"Oh, it looks cool, huh? That's why you want it?"
00:00:50.008,00:01:00.394,"Yeah, you know, I mean, it's different from the stuff on Earth, and, you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy and, you know, I don't really have anything to remember all those trips by."
00:01:00.477,00:01:03.397,"It'd be kind of cool, like a souvenir, you know?"
00:01:03.480,00:01:05.732,Like what if you passed away or died or something?
00:01:06.066,00:01:09.361,I wouldn't even have anything to remember all the cool stuff we did.
00:01:52.821,00:01:55.657,So we're just going to pretend this isn't happening?
00:01:55.782,00:01:58.076,"I'm not saying that's a bad idea, just asking."
00:01:58.201,00:02:00.996,"Rick, why would you let Morty bring that thing into our house?"
00:02:01.121,00:02:05.751,What do you want from me? He thought it looked cool. You know what I mean?
00:02:11.715,00:02:14.676,"Alright, back upstairs."
00:02:19.056,00:02:20.307,"Well, I'm intervening."
00:02:20.515,00:02:21.933,Intervening with puberty?
00:02:22.017,00:02:24.936,You'll turn him into Ralph Fiennes in Red Dragon.
00:02:25.020,00:02:27.481,"He's at that age, let's just be proud of him."
00:02:27.731,00:02:30.025,"Jesus, did I really set the bar that low?"
00:02:30.984,00:02:34.363,Rick! Could you come with me please? Quickly!
00:02:35.614,00:02:38.533,"Okay, now if we hear squeaking, we intervene."
00:02:40.452,00:02:42.037,"Where's the sex robot, Morty?"
00:02:42.162,00:02:44.247,"That is Gwendolyn, I mean the robot."
00:02:44.581,00:02:46.792,She started beeping and then transformed and tried to fly away.
00:02:47.167,00:02:49.086,"Strange, that's usually the man's job."
00:02:52.673,00:02:55.217,"Morty, that's my catch phrase, remember?"
00:02:55.425,00:02:57.928,Remember how I cemented that catch phrase?
00:02:58.136,00:03:01.264,"Alright, alright, seriously though, let me grab this thing."
00:03:03.016,00:03:04.434,"Come on, you, rascal."
00:03:04.685,00:03:07.896,"-Okay, unacceptable. -What is going on?"
00:03:08.313,00:03:10.732,-Alright. Uh oh. -Uh oh? What is that?
00:03:12.526,00:03:15.570,I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends.
00:03:17.447,00:03:21.827,"Genetic compiler, incubation chamber... Yep, this here's some kind of baby maker."
00:03:25.622,00:03:27.666,"It's my bad, guys, I'll take care of it."
00:03:27.791,00:03:30.544,"-Grandpa Rick, no! -Dad, what do you think you're doing?"
00:03:30.752,00:03:34.256,"Listen, you guys quarantined the house when Summer brought olives back from Mexico."
00:03:36.758,00:03:39.594,"I mean, it might eat brains and exhale space AIDS."
00:03:39.678,00:03:40.554,We gotta be careful.
00:03:40.637,00:03:43.640,"I lost the chance to be careful, Rick. I'm a father now."
00:03:43.765,00:03:45.976,You know. It's time for me to be responsible.
00:03:46.059,00:03:48.937,"-Isn't that right, Morty Junior? -Don't name it. Crap, he named it."
00:03:49.020,00:03:52.190,"Well, dad, it's a living thing. And it's half-human."
00:03:52.315,00:03:57.654,"And it was born on American soil, which entitles it-- Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake, don't punish us for it."
00:03:58.947,00:04:01.992,"Fine, I'm gonna take this thing to my workshop and do a little bit of investigating."
00:04:02.242,00:04:04.536,Do not let that thing out of your sight.
00:04:04.619,00:04:07.038,"It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous."
00:04:07.247,00:04:08.749,Like the Insane Clown Posse.
00:04:08.874,00:04:13.336,"Yeah, good one, Jerry, 2003 just called, it wants its easy target back."
00:04:14.796,00:04:15.964,He's like a little me.
00:04:16.047,00:04:19.050,"You don't think he'll turn into a monster, do you?"
00:04:19.176,00:04:20.093,They always do.
00:04:20.177,00:04:26.266,"Hey, 1995 called, they want their certain year called wanting its blank back formula back!"
00:04:26.349,00:04:28.602,"Why, Jerry? Why expend the effort?"
00:04:28.685,00:04:30.437,Life is effort and I'll stop when I die!
00:04:33.064,00:04:34.649,-Out. -What are you doing?
00:04:34.733,00:04:38.653,"Well, I can't solve the problem my way, thanks to your family's primitive biological hang-ups."
00:04:38.737,00:04:41.114,"Gross, I might've just touched one of Morty's loads."
00:04:41.323,00:04:50.457,"But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Junior on this robot's home world, which is... Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system. Scoot, Summer."
00:04:50.540,00:04:53.835,Don't you need a new companion now that Morty's in the family way?
00:04:54.085,00:04:56.087,"I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer."
00:04:56.338,00:05:02.469,"Oh, right! Because there's something about having a wiener Oh, crap."
00:05:03.929,00:05:05.305,Grandpa Rick.
00:05:06.181,00:05:07.682,Help! Help!
00:05:13.146,00:05:16.024,-Grandpa Rick! -Still think it's a good idea to go through holes without a wiener?
00:05:16.316,00:05:18.568,"-I want to go home! -Yeah, no duh."
00:05:23.156,00:05:27.077,Great. Now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs.
00:05:27.828,00:05:29.955,"-You're doing great, Morty. -Really? You think?"
00:05:30.163,00:05:33.083,I mean I'm not doing much of anything. What do I do if it cries?
00:05:33.333,00:05:35.168,Then you put it down and let it cry itself out.
00:05:35.252,00:05:36.545,"Yeah, right."
00:05:36.628,00:05:39.589,We tried that technique on Summer and she's gonna end up stripping.
00:05:39.673,00:05:42.175,Isn't she? Yes she is.
00:05:42.300,00:05:45.554,She's gonna strip for attention because she was denied it!
00:05:46.972,00:05:52.351,"Stop filling it with your own insecurity, you're gonna turn it into Mort-- More of you."
00:05:52.602,00:05:56.106,Well we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentally ill scientist!
00:05:59.901,00:06:02.696,Listen to me. I am not rewarding this behavior.
00:06:02.779,00:06:05.782,"Knock it off, both of you! Give me him, give me my baby."
00:06:05.866,00:06:09.244,You're both nuts! I'm gonna raise Morty Junior myself!
00:06:16.918,00:06:20.797,"-You are going to ruin that kid, Morty. -At least we can agree on that."
00:06:28.972,00:06:30.473,"Thanks, Dumb-dumb."
00:06:31.683,00:06:33.768,"I said thanks, Dumb-dumb. Go get more."
00:06:33.894,00:06:39.649,"-Summer, put your burka on. -That burka is a human rights violation and I spent a lot on this top."
00:06:39.900,00:06:46.865,"Look, I'm trying to repair a portal gun with a bunch of sex doll parts and I have to do it one-handed to keep these Belushis from carting you off."
00:06:46.990,00:06:49.576,The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender.
00:06:49.701,00:06:52.954,What's the deal with this place? Why is it such a sausage planet?
00:06:53.163,00:06:55.624,And how did such backward idiots invent robots?
00:06:55.707,00:07:01.046,"Obviously, at some point, the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines."
00:07:01.296,00:07:10.972,"The resultant lack of distraction and henpecking allowed them to focus entirely on war, so they bombed themselves back to the stone age and now they just fight with each other over fake pussy with sticks and rocks all day long."
00:07:11.056,00:07:13.141,You think it's efficient to get rid of women?
00:07:13.266,00:07:16.770,"You ever see a line for the men's room? Do you hear me, Summer?"
00:07:30.659,00:07:32.243,"You might want to cover your eyes, Summer."
00:07:32.327,00:07:34.120,"Yeah, like it was my dream to watch."
00:07:38.458,00:07:40.293,"Summer, grab hold."
00:07:45.590,00:07:47.300,"Grandpa Rick, where are we going?"
00:07:47.592,00:07:56.977,"Well obviously, Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class. Sound familiar?"
00:07:57.310,00:07:58.561,Ticketmaster.
00:07:58.728,00:08:00.480,"Oh. There we go, Summer. Hey, brother."
00:08:00.814,00:08:03.775,"Hey, bro. Nice racket you got going on here."
00:08:04.025,00:08:06.695,"Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from Earth, dimension C-137."
00:08:08.822,00:08:12.367,"It's all cool, good in the neighborhood."
00:08:12.534,00:08:13.827,Is what I meant.
00:08:17.205,00:08:18.415,"Oh, I get it."
00:08:18.581,00:08:21.001,The old behind every great man Amazon twist.
00:08:21.126,00:08:22.127,Silence!
00:08:26.131,00:08:28.633,-Your slave is ill-mannered. -My slave?
00:08:28.883,00:08:32.762,"We assume you are from a more primitive world, where men are still permitted to be servants?"
00:08:33.221,00:08:35.390,"If he is a rogue male, tell us now and we will kill him."
00:08:35.807,00:08:38.101,He's my slave! He's my slave. He's definitely my slave.
00:08:51.364,00:08:53.324,"You're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you?"
00:08:53.408,00:08:55.869,"Yeah, you're my special little guy."
00:08:59.539,00:09:01.499,"-Da! -What was that, Morty Jr.?"
00:09:01.583,00:09:03.626,Were you going to say da-da? Say da-da.
00:09:03.877,00:09:04.711,Death!
00:09:05.503,00:09:07.547,-Da-da. -Domination.
00:09:09.007,00:09:09.841,Da-da?
00:09:09.924,00:09:11.718,Destruction. Domination.
00:09:22.854,00:09:25.398,Plan your route accordingly and expect delays.
00:09:25.523,00:09:28.485,"We're not telling you what to do, we're just sharing how we feel."
00:09:28.610,00:09:31.279,And now weather. Is anyone else cold or is it just me?
00:09:34.324,00:09:37.202,"I am Mar-Sha, ruler of Gazorpazorp."
00:09:37.368,00:09:39.996,-I am here if you need to talk. -What is this place?
00:09:40.080,00:09:49.214,"Paradise. We built it during the Great Passive Aggression, when the females separated from the males due to their increasingly destructive behavior."
00:09:49.297,00:09:52.050,-I am here if you need to talk. -I am here if you need to talk.
00:09:52.133,00:09:56.387,"From here, we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population."
00:09:56.471,00:09:59.557,Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery.
00:09:59.974,00:10:06.981,"The females are placed into educational programs, where they can discover a service to our paradise that fulfills them most."
00:10:07.649,00:10:09.192,The males...
00:10:09.984,00:10:11.820,they get to play outside.
00:10:13.321,00:10:15.031,That was just a baby.
00:10:15.156,00:10:20.411,"And within a day he'll be an adult male Gazorpian, one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe."
00:10:20.495,00:10:21.329,Wait a minute.
00:10:21.538,00:10:24.874,We're here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet.
00:10:28.169,00:10:30.380,"You speak when you're spoken to, ding-a-ling!"
00:10:30.672,00:10:32.924,"It's true, though, one of your babies was born on Earth."
00:10:33.133,00:10:35.218,Are you the ruler of this Earth?
00:10:35.468,00:10:37.554,-How did you know? -The quality of your top.
00:10:37.679,00:10:39.681,-Do you love it? -I love it.
00:10:39.764,00:10:43.393,-I am here if you need to talk. -I am here if you need to talk.
00:10:43.643,00:10:46.396,"If the Gazorpian is male, your Earth is in grave danger."
00:10:46.479,00:10:49.232,We will give you passage back home so it can be terminated.
00:10:49.357,00:10:51.317,"But first, mojitos."
00:10:51.901,00:10:54.487,-We don't have time for mojitos. -You are insulting them.
00:10:54.571,00:10:57.740,"I don't care, Summer, this place is the worst, I want to go home!"
00:10:57.824,00:11:01.786,"Well, it really doesn't matter what you want, because this is a sane place where women rule!"
00:11:01.870,00:11:03.538,Yeah? You know what I have to say about that?
00:11:06.416,00:11:08.168,I cannot believe my ears.
00:11:13.006,00:11:15.884,"Oh, boy. Who let the frogs out, huh?"
00:11:16.176,00:11:17.427,Grandpa!
00:11:18.303,00:11:20.221,-Grandpa? -That sounds patriarchal.
00:11:20.430,00:11:22.348,It means father of fathers.
00:11:22.515,00:11:27.312,Then this one is not your slave and your Earth is yet another planet dominated by men!
00:11:27.395,00:11:30.773,"It's not dominated by us, okay? On Earth, men and women are equals."
00:11:31.024,00:11:34.319,Equals? We make 70 percent of your salary for the same job.
00:11:34.569,00:11:35.820,Seize them!
00:11:37.822,00:11:39.866,"Was this really the time to make that point, Summer?"
00:11:42.285,00:11:43.953,"This is for you, daddy!"
00:11:44.078,00:11:45.079,"Oh, man."
00:11:45.288,00:11:49.918,"Okay, listen to me, Morty Jr., I gotta tell you something very important, okay?"
00:11:50.126,00:11:51.920,Killing is bad. Bad.
00:11:54.172,00:11:56.424,"No, Morty Jr., I'm being serious, okay?"
00:11:56.549,00:11:58.843,You need to put your energy into something else.
00:11:59.010,00:12:01.304,"I mean, what about dancing? Would you like to learn how to dance?"
00:12:01.596,00:12:04.140,I would like to dance. On the graves of my enemies.
00:12:08.686,00:12:11.730,-Daddy? Can I go outside? -No. Absolutely not.
00:12:11.940,00:12:14.234,But that's where all the people and the animals are.
00:12:14.442,00:12:16.110,"Yeah, but you can't go out there, because..."
00:12:16.319,00:12:17.320,the air is poisonous!
00:12:17.695,00:12:21.449,For you. You will die instantly if you ever leave this house.
00:12:21.658,00:12:23.034,-You hear me? -For real?
00:12:28.957,00:12:32.168,"Yay! Look, we're gonna dance. Come on, dance with me here. We love to dance!"
00:12:32.377,00:12:33.670,Why do we love to dance?
00:12:33.878,00:12:35.171,Because I said so!
00:12:37.215,00:12:39.008,-Nice. -Nice.
00:12:44.472,00:12:46.516,"So, what are you in for?"
00:12:46.641,00:12:49.811,"Because, I got a big, you know, penis between my legs."
00:12:49.936,00:12:51.312,What are you in for?
00:12:51.396,00:12:53.731,The worst crime a female can commit.
00:12:53.856,00:12:58.736,"Veronica Ann Bennet, I find you guilty of having bad bangs."
00:12:58.820,00:13:02.156,You ever notice the ones with bad bangs always have three names?
00:13:02.407,00:13:05.535,You are hereby sentenced to the silent treatment.
00:13:06.911,00:13:10.039,-This is gonna be cake. -No! Jackie!
00:13:10.456,00:13:22.010,"Rick and Summer of Earth, for the crimes of treason against womankind and for creating the sound of which we do not speak, because it does not exist, -you are hereby sentenced to-- -What, a night on the couch?"
00:13:22.218,00:13:23.761,"-Death. -Oh, gerp."
00:13:24.012,00:13:25.722,I hate you so much right now.
00:13:25.804,00:13:34.480,"This will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years, due to our awesomeness, so we are forced to improvise."
00:13:34.564,00:13:40.111,"We placed a large boulder on that ledge-- Holy shit, you're gonna crush us with a boulder?"
00:13:40.320,00:13:42.113,No! Stop interrupting.
00:13:42.196,00:13:46.576,"The boulder falls onto a lever, that will launch knives."
00:13:46.659,00:13:48.870,"What? Just give me a gun, I'll kill myself!"
00:13:49.120,00:13:50.705,Stop interrupting.
00:13:50.913,00:13:52.707,The knives will...
00:13:52.915,00:13:56.586,"Fine, you were right the first time, okay? The boulder crushes you."
00:13:56.669,00:13:58.796,"I just didn't want to admit you were right, happy?"
00:13:58.880,00:14:02.133,"-No, just ignore them, ignore them. -Such an asshole."
00:14:02.675,00:14:05.803,"Look, I'm sorry, Summer. I feel bad that I let you drag us into this."
00:14:05.928,00:14:11.517,"I wish I could've been a better grandpa to you, and, you know, for what it's worth, that is a really nice cute top that you're wearing there."
00:14:11.642,00:14:14.187,Top. My top! My top!
00:14:14.437,00:14:19.567,The same top you complimented earlier. Look! Look at the tag! Read it!
00:14:19.776,00:14:22.278,It says: Marc Jacobs.
00:14:22.528,00:14:25.406,"Marc, Jacob, these are names of the penis."
00:14:25.740,00:14:29.160,Yes. An Earth man made this top.
00:14:29.494,00:14:40.046,"Maybe on your planet, separation of the genders is the right thing to do, but on Earth a certain percentage of our males are born gay, which is why my clothes are better than all of yours."
00:14:41.964,00:14:46.844,"It's true. And sometimes the truth hurts, but it must be accepted."
00:14:46.969,00:14:53.726,"Like if I told you that you're using the wrong color foundation for your skin and it ends at your neck, making you look like a party clown."
00:14:53.976,00:14:55.520,"Okay, ouch, noted."
00:14:55.603,00:15:02.860,"But the fact remains, if you impose Gazorpazorp's laws on Earth, you're no better than the men whose farts shall remain unspoken."
00:15:03.236,00:15:06.864,"And if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute."
00:15:08.825,00:15:15.998,"Very well. Give the Earth people a spacecraft so they may head back to their weird planet where women are kind of equal, but not really."
00:15:17.458,00:15:20.878,"And thanks, girls. You know, you girls are really something, I'll tell you that."
00:15:23.506,00:15:24.632,Give them a ship now.
00:15:25.967,00:15:27.927,Morty Jr.! Smoking?
00:15:28.261,00:15:29.429,That is not okay!
00:15:29.554,00:15:32.181,"What are you gonna do, ground me? I can't go outside anyway!"
00:15:32.265,00:15:37.103,"So what? You could do things inside, You could play guitar, you could masturbate."
00:15:37.311,00:15:39.647,"I don't want to masturbate, I want to conquer the planet!"
00:15:39.856,00:15:40.940,"Oh, here we go again."
00:15:41.023,00:15:44.360,"You know, who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet, Morty Jr.?"
00:15:44.652,00:15:47.488,"Love, that's all you care about! What about weapons?"
00:15:47.697,00:15:49.073,What about domination of the enemy?
00:15:49.157,00:15:50.867,"Alright, that's it, no more History Channel!"
00:15:50.992,00:15:53.661,This TV is for cartoons and video games only!
00:15:53.911,00:15:56.622,-I hate video games. -You take that back!
00:15:57.623,00:15:58.458,Give it to me!
00:16:01.085,00:16:04.088,"I didn't mean that. I didn't mean to do that, I'm sorry."
00:16:04.297,00:16:05.590,I can't take this anymore.
00:16:05.798,00:16:08.593,I'd rather breathe poison than live another minute with you!
00:16:08.843,00:16:10.428,No. Stop!
00:16:16.476,00:16:19.562,My life has been a lie! God is dead! The government's lame!
00:16:19.854,00:16:21.564,Thanksgiving is about killing Indians!
00:16:21.647,00:16:24.942,"Jesus wasn't born on Christmas, they moved the date, it was a pagan holiday!"
00:16:25.902,00:16:27.278,"-Oh, dad! -Yes, Morty?"
00:16:27.361,00:16:31.949,"My son is gonna take over the planet and I am too young to drive, can you help me get him back?"
00:16:33.159,00:16:36.162,"I suppose, Morty, I suppose."
00:16:36.496,00:16:41.626,"But first, a deep sip from a very tall glass of I told you so."
00:16:46.464,00:16:48.508,"Oh, my god, dad, come on!"
00:17:13.616,00:17:15.034,Kill!
00:17:35.012,00:17:36.013,"Dad, there he is!"
00:17:41.227,00:17:42.228,"Oh, my god, dad!"
00:17:43.896,00:17:44.897,"Morty Jr., no!"
00:17:45.398,00:17:46.983,It's me. It's dad.
00:17:47.817,00:17:49.026,It's okay.
00:17:49.443,00:17:51.112,"Put the car down, Morty Jr."
00:17:51.279,00:17:55.032,"No! No, where's your hands?"
00:17:57.243,00:17:58.452,My car!
00:17:58.661,00:18:04.125,"And that's how we play handy hands -Out of the way, Morty. -No."
00:18:04.500,00:18:08.379,"Morty, that's one of the most violently aggressive creatures in the universe."
00:18:08.713,00:18:13.050,"He's my son and if you hurt him, you'll have to kill me, Rick."
00:18:18.222,00:18:21.225,"Dad, I'm so confused."
00:18:21.475,00:18:23.894,"I know, Morty Junior. I'm sorry."
00:18:24.186,00:18:27.231,I ended up lying to you and yelling at you just like my parents did to me.
00:18:27.356,00:18:29.859,"You know, parents are just kids having kids."
00:18:30.026,00:18:36.407,"One minute you like how a shiny robot looks, the next minute you're in a fist fight with your alien son."
00:18:36.532,00:18:37.700,I'm an alien?
00:18:43.289,00:18:45.875,But I want to murder everyone I see.
00:18:46.125,00:18:49.253,"You know, I mean, maybe there's a job out there for people that feel that way."
00:18:49.420,00:18:55.718,"Actually, there is. Hi, I'm Brad Anderson, creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip Marmaduke."
00:18:56.010,00:18:57.637,You should consider being a creative.
00:18:57.720,00:19:04.977,"I'm haunted by uncontrollable thoughts of mutilation and sexual assault on a near daily basis, but, you know, I channel it all into my work."
00:19:05.186,00:19:06.312,Wow.
00:19:06.395,00:19:08.773,I never got that impression from reading Marmaduke.
00:19:08.981,00:19:12.276,Well did you get the impression I was trying to make you laugh?
00:19:13.986,00:19:15.905,Tell me that wasn't Brad Anderson.
00:19:16.405,00:19:20.326,"See, you hear that, Morty Junior? Maybe you could try being a creative of some kind."
00:19:20.534,00:19:24.705,Maybe. I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of a novel.
00:19:24.830,00:19:30.628,"I mean, what I really want to do is slit people's throats, -but beyond that. -I know you can do it, son."
00:19:30.795,00:19:33.839,I think it's time I get a place of my own.
00:19:34.048,00:19:38.594,I promise I'll call you every day I need money or a place to do laundry.
00:19:46.227,00:19:50.898,So I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear axle?
00:19:52.149,00:19:57.905,"Isn't it interesting, Summer, that after all that stuff we just did, nothing really mattered and there was no point to it?"
00:19:57.988,00:20:00.408,"It kind of makes you wonder, huh? About nothing."
00:20:00.491,00:20:04.412,Are you sure it doesn't make you reevaluate your policy about taking girls on adventures?
00:20:04.537,00:20:12.211,"No. I'd say given what we've been through, that I was right the whole time and any epiphanies about gender politics were a projection of your feminine insecurity."
00:20:12.336,00:20:18.050,"But hey, why don't you have a pink spaceship, go ride around and have a jolly old time? Maybe that'll shut you up."
00:20:18.134,00:20:20.511,Dad? Summer? Where were you guys this whole time?
00:20:23.764,00:20:30.855,"Oh, that's interesting, Beth, you know, it's funny, I heard about a little bit of news myself. Take a look. Take a listen."
00:20:37.111,00:20:41.449,This world's still got a chance! Yeah!
00:20:41.782,00:20:44.410,See you guys next week! See everybody next week.
00:21:14.815,00:21:17.359,"Mortimer Smith Junior, New York Times bestselling author."
00:21:17.610,00:21:23.282,"Your book is about innocence, the definition of it and inevitably, its impossibility. Is it autobiographical?"
00:21:23.657,00:21:29.705,"Certainly, I mean, all writing is, in my opinion, but my..."
00:21:30.664,00:21:35.419,my father kept me locked in the house until I was a teenager.
00:21:36.128,00:21:42.301,"And there was violence and threats of poison gas, but also dancing."
00:21:42.635,00:21:56.023,"But you persevered and created this masterpiece from your suffering, Smith Junior's mind-bending novel My Horrible Father in every store It's a thankless job, Morty. You did the best you could."
00:21:56.190,00:21:57.483,I hope he's eating enough.
00:00:12.513,00:00:14.139,-I told you. -Hold on.
00:00:14.389,00:00:17.893,Will you please not marry me? I choose Veronica.
00:00:18.143,00:00:19.061,-What? -Yes!
00:00:19.144,00:00:21.230,-Called it. -Why would he choose Veronica?
00:00:21.313,00:00:26.485,"-Because he loves her. -Well, if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered and the entire show was stupid."
00:00:26.568,00:00:27.653,"Okay, I've got an idea, Rick."
00:00:27.986,00:00:31.657,You show us your concept of good TV and we'll crap all over that.
00:00:31.865,00:00:33.325,I thought you'd never ask.
00:00:34.409,00:00:35.410,Hey!
00:00:35.494,00:00:37.621,"Oh, cool, is that crystallized xanthanite?"
00:00:37.704,00:00:39.498,It conducts electrons across dimensions.
00:00:39.581,00:00:41.875,"Twenty percent accurate as usual, Morty."
00:00:42.000,00:00:47.005,"The important thing being, I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality."
00:00:47.256,00:00:48.674,"Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme?"
00:00:48.882,00:00:51.426,How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn?
00:00:51.843,00:00:53.929,We're not so different. We're both corn of action.
00:00:54.012,00:00:57.015,"Yeah, but one of us is dead corn."
00:01:01.436,00:01:04.022,"So, what, it'd be better if the people were corn?"
00:01:05.232,00:01:08.360,This is infinite TV from infinite universes. Look.
00:01:08.652,00:01:10.487,This shit is delicious.
00:01:13.407,00:01:15.075,A violent antiques show.
00:01:24.209,00:01:25.586,No! The other thing! Go back!
00:01:27.254,00:01:30.465,"Glen, this is a court order. It says you can't eat shit anymore."
00:01:31.633,00:01:34.678,"Alright, Jerry, when you're right, you're right. Now I'm hooked."
00:02:10.505,00:02:12.215,Shmlantha! Shmlona!
00:02:12.299,00:02:15.344,Amazing. A dimension where all proper nouns begin with Shml.
00:02:19.765,00:02:22.392,"Alright, that actually got old pretty quick."
00:02:22.559,00:02:26.480,"Rick, will you please go back to me on David Letterman?"
00:02:31.276,00:02:32.944,You speak da tru tru.
00:02:33.195,00:02:35.489,"Oh, my god. Dad's in Cloud Atlas!"
00:02:35.572,00:02:38.116,I'm in Cloud Atlas! What's Cloud Atlas?
00:02:38.325,00:02:42.204,Sometime small Tru Tru diff'rent dan da big tru tru.
00:02:42.579,00:02:43.789,How is this possible?
00:02:43.872,00:02:47.584,"Infinite timelines, infinite possibilities, including a timeline where Jerry's a movie star."
00:02:48.126,00:02:51.129,"Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device."
00:02:51.213,00:02:52.422,Look at this.
00:02:55.425,00:02:58.804,"I just want to know who could've done something like this, it's a travesty."
00:02:58.929,00:03:01.807,"I did, you see this knife and all the blood on it? Here's my finger prints."
00:03:02.057,00:03:03.642,Guilty. I sentence you to life in prison.
00:03:04.726,00:03:05.686,Here's another quick mystery.
00:03:05.936,00:03:07.979,-My mother's dead! -And I killed her.
00:03:08.105,00:03:10.691,"Here's the weapon and cuff me, thank you very much."
00:03:10.899,00:03:12.150,Guilty. Sentenced to murder.
00:03:15.946,00:03:18.407,"Oh, wow. That one was really quick, wasn't it?"
00:03:18.532,00:03:26.581,"Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate selves?"
00:03:26.832,00:03:29.167,-The narcissistic option. -I want to obsess about myself.
00:03:29.584,00:03:35.298,Here. These scan your retinas and let you view parallel timelines through genetically matching versions of your eyes. Go fetch.
00:03:38.093,00:03:40.846,"-I'm proud of you, Morty. -I don't give a crap about myself, Rick."
00:03:40.929,00:03:42.472,"Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo."
00:03:42.889,00:03:46.518,I'm Ants In My Eyes Johnson here at Ants In My Eyes Johnson's Electronics!
00:03:46.685,00:03:51.565,I mean there's so many ants in my eyes and there's so many TV's! Microwaves! Radios!
00:03:51.648,00:03:56.361,I'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock because I can't see anything!
00:03:56.820,00:03:59.197,"Our prices, I hope, aren't too low!"
00:03:59.448,00:04:01.908,Check out this refrigerator! Only 200 dollars!
00:04:02.117,00:04:05.287,What about this microwave? Only 100 dollars! That's fair!
00:04:05.495,00:04:12.294,"I'm Ants in my Eyes Johnson! Everything's black! I can't see a thing, and also I can't feel anything either, did I mention that?"
00:04:12.377,00:04:17.758,"But that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes, so that always goes, you know, off by the wayside."
00:04:17.841,00:04:24.306,"I can't feel, it's a very rare disease, all my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch."
00:04:27.976,00:04:31.021,Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives?
00:04:31.271,00:04:34.858,"You're right, maybe we should just play Yahtzee. Give me those!"
00:04:41.323,00:04:43.992,"You're my best friend, Jerry Smith. I love doing cocaine with you."
00:04:44.242,00:04:47.579,"Whoa! I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp!"
00:04:55.712,00:04:59.216,"That's great, Beth. You always wanted to be a real surgeon."
00:04:59.341,00:05:01.343,I am a real surgeon.
00:05:01.510,00:05:04.137,-Summer's turn! -Finally.
00:05:05.555,00:05:06.473,I don't see anything.
00:05:06.681,00:05:12.062,"Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there's a chance you weren't even born."
00:05:12.145,00:05:15.023,"That came out wrong, that came out very wrong."
00:05:21.696,00:05:23.031,We're playing Yahtzee.
00:05:23.281,00:05:25.075,Yahtzee's fun. We love Yahtzee.
00:05:25.200,00:05:28.662,It's a fun game for fun families. Could I get those goggles back for a second?
00:05:32.332,00:05:35.585,and it's the official car of Mr. Sneezy 3-D.
00:05:35.669,00:05:38.547,It's the brand new Sneezy XL.
00:05:38.713,00:05:40.966,The horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise.
00:05:42.551,00:05:49.307,"It's polite, it's right, and it's sneezy, deezy Mc Deluxe."
00:05:52.394,00:05:55.438,Seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it.
00:05:55.522,00:05:58.357,"Yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone."
00:06:00.986,00:06:03.196,Two brothers in a van.
00:06:03.446,00:06:06.867,And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could.
00:06:09.368,00:06:11.454,And then a giant tornado came.
00:06:11.580,00:06:15.000,And that's when things got knocked into twelfth gear.
00:06:16.793,00:06:22.299,A Mexican armada shows up with weapons made from tomatoes.
00:06:22.716,00:06:28.096,And you better bet your bottom dollar that these two brothers know how to handle business.
00:06:28.263,00:06:42.027,In: Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers Who Are Just Regular Brothers Running In A Van From An Asteroid And All Sorts Of Things The Movie.
00:06:42.527,00:06:44.070,"Hold on, there's more."
00:06:44.279,00:06:51.161,"Old women are coming, and they're also in the movie, and they're going to come and cross attack these two brothers."
00:06:51.912,00:06:55.916,But let's get back to the brothers because they have a strong bond.
00:06:56.166,00:06:57.459,You don't want to know about it here.
00:07:01.171,00:07:03.924,And what do you do then? It's two brothers and...
00:07:04.007,00:07:05.342,they're going to...
00:07:05.592,00:07:07.177,it's called Two Brothers.
00:07:12.432,00:07:14.392,"Come on, time's up."
00:07:14.601,00:07:16.102,I'm taming a lion.
00:07:16.186,00:07:20.732,"No, wait, there are film cameras. I might be a lion tamer in a movie."
00:07:20.857,00:07:23.318,"You get the idea, I work with lions."
00:07:24.986,00:07:29.032,We're not playing Yahtzee! We're playing Chutes and Ladders.
00:07:29.366,00:07:33.411,"Seems like when I exist, life gets a little more, I don't know, predictable?"
00:07:33.870,00:07:39.084,"When two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals."
00:07:39.209,00:07:43.129,"Give me a break, we're not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night."
00:07:43.213,00:07:49.386,"I get it, now that you know you could've had it better, you resent me for holding you back."
00:07:49.511,00:07:54.099,"Well now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables."
00:07:54.224,00:07:55.266,What are you talking about?
00:07:55.475,00:07:59.771,All this time you've been thinking: What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?
00:07:59.854,00:08:02.774,Well now you know. You'd be a doctor. Whoopdee doo.
00:08:02.899,00:08:10.156,You'd also be drinking wine alone in a house full of exotic birds and I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht banging Kristen Stewart!
00:08:10.281,00:08:11.574,You thought about getting an abortion?
00:08:11.783,00:08:12.951,Everyone thinks about it.
00:08:13.034,00:08:18.164,"Obviously, I'm the version of me that didn't do it, -so you're welcome. -Yeah, you're welcome."
00:08:18.373,00:08:20.000,"Yeah, thank you guys so much!"
00:08:20.125,00:08:25.296,It's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy!
00:08:25.380,00:08:27.507,"Hey, do we have any wafer cookies?"
00:08:29.050,00:08:33.763,"Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh?"
00:08:33.847,00:08:38.435,"That's too bad. You know, me and Morty are having a blast, we just discovered a show called Ball Fondlers."
00:08:38.560,00:08:43.023,"I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse."
00:08:55.702,00:08:57.954,-I'm in heaven right now. -This might be the best day of my life.
00:09:00.081,00:09:02.083,That show Ball Fondlers sounded kind of interesting.
00:09:02.167,00:09:04.461,-Dad! -What? They're having fun in there.
00:09:04.544,00:09:05.837,What do you guys want from me?
00:09:06.046,00:09:09.507,Every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice.
00:09:09.632,00:09:13.762,Our family has interdimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not.
00:09:14.012,00:09:16.431,"-Well, I'm leaving. -You can't leave, you're 17."
00:09:16.681,00:09:18.183,"Yeah, and I'm not pregnant."
00:09:18.266,00:09:21.144,I'm gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age.
00:09:21.227,00:09:26.649,"I'm gonna move to the southwest and I don't know, do something with turquoise."
00:09:30.612,00:09:56.554,"Starring: a piece of toast, two guys with handlebar mustaches, a man painted silver who makes robot noises, Gar Ma Nar Nar, three... I'll get back to that one, a hole in the wall where the men can see it all, and returning for his twenty-fifth consecutive year: Bobby Moynihan."
00:09:57.305,00:10:00.892,"Interesting fun fact, Moynihan and piece of toast hate each other."
00:10:00.975,00:10:03.269,Apparently they've got some real creative differences.
00:10:03.853,00:10:09.818,"Hey, are you tired of real doors cluttering up your house where you open them and you actually go somewhere and you go into another room?"
00:10:10.068,00:10:12.403,"Get on down to Real Fake Doors, that's us!"
00:10:12.695,00:10:15.615,"Fill a whole room up with them. See, watch, check this out."
00:10:15.740,00:10:17.867,Won't open. Won't open.
00:10:18.076,00:10:21.037,Not this one. Not this one. None of them open!
00:10:21.287,00:10:28.503,Fakedoors.com is our website so check it out for a lot of really great deals on fake doors!
00:10:36.302,00:10:39.472,"Wait a minute, Rick. I thought this was a commercial, what's going on?"
00:10:39.556,00:10:42.433,"Relax, Morty. Don't worry about it, let's just see where this goes."
00:10:46.980,00:10:48.398,Son of a bitch.
00:10:50.233,00:10:53.319,"See, that must be where he lives. Okay."
00:11:00.118,00:11:01.119,"Hey, everybody!"
00:11:04.747,00:11:07.041,Still here. Still selling fake doors.
00:11:09.377,00:11:11.504,We have fake doors like you wouldn't believe.
00:11:11.588,00:11:13.882,What are you worried about? Come get fake doors.

00:11:16.176,00:11:18.928,Don't even hesitate. Don't even worry.
00:11:19.053,00:11:20.847,"-Alright I'm bored. Change it. -Wait, hold on."
00:11:20.930,00:11:23.141,Don't give it a second thought. That's our slogan.
00:11:23.224,00:11:25.185,See it on the bottom of the screen below our name.
00:11:25.310,00:11:27.645,"Here's another slogan, right below that one."
00:11:27.729,00:11:30.982,What are you worried about? Come get fake doors! Get in here quick.
00:11:33.943,00:11:36.321,-Okay you can change it. -And don't even worry about it!
00:11:39.616,00:11:41.326,and I really could go for some enchiladas.
00:11:44.120,00:11:46.664,"It's just like Garfield, only instead it's Gazorpazorpfield."
00:11:46.915,00:11:50.210,"Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where those sex robots came from?"
00:11:50.293,00:11:51.461,Remember that whole thing?
00:11:51.669,00:11:54.964,"Yeah. Hey, that's a pretty... That's true. That's right."
00:11:55.215,00:11:58.343,Yeah. Let's watch some more Gazorpazorpfield.
00:11:58.717,00:12:00.386,"Hey, John, it's me, Gazorpazorpfield."
00:12:04.557,00:12:07.268,"Come on, Gazorpazorpfield. Go easy on me, huh?"
00:12:07.352,00:12:10.897,"You dumb, stupid, weak, pathetic."
00:12:11.689,00:12:16.402,White. White... guilt. White guilt.
00:12:16.945,00:12:20.073,"Milquetoast, piece of human garbage."
00:12:20.198,00:12:22.242,"Jeez, Gazorpazorpfield, that's, you know."
00:12:22.325,00:12:24.285,"You are pretty mean to me, but that takes the cake."
00:12:30.667,00:12:31.709,"Hey, Rick, you know."
00:12:31.793,00:12:34.337,Did they use Bill Murray for this? Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.
00:12:34.420,00:12:37.715,"No, Morty it's Lorenzo Music. In this reality he's still alive."
00:12:37.799,00:12:40.759,"-Okay. Was his name Lorenzo Music? -Yeah, I'm pretty sure."
00:12:53.815,00:12:56.609,"I don't know. Just making conversation with you, Morty."
00:12:56.693,00:12:59.445,"What do you think, I know everything about everything?"
00:13:00.280,00:13:02.490,Did you really talk me out of the abortion?
00:13:02.573,00:13:05.743,"Well, we blew a tire on the way to the clinic."
00:13:06.119,00:13:09.372,"I think in my head, I was doing it all for the kids."
00:13:09.455,00:13:13.042,And now the first kid is going to do something with turquoise.
00:13:13.293,00:13:15.878,Which is either code for crystal meth or a gateway to it.
00:13:16.004,00:13:18.298,So we didn't do the kids any favors.
00:13:18.548,00:13:23.011,So we should stay together for each other and ourselves or...
00:13:23.720,00:13:24.929,Or?
00:13:29.642,00:13:34.813,We know science has created men that have a trunk that allows them to have sex with both male and female partners.
00:13:34.939,00:13:37.650,But we don't like the idea of these people getting married.
00:13:37.775,00:13:39.861,"Put a line in the sand, everybody."
00:13:39.986,00:13:42.155,Vote no on proposition XW2.
00:13:42.280,00:13:45.658,The act that says gay... Trunk People can get married. Who needs it?
00:13:45.908,00:13:47.035,Not on my watch!
00:13:47.118,00:13:50.455,Paid for by Michael Dennies and the Denny Singers.
00:13:51.497,00:13:56.252,"Hi, I'm a Trunk Person and I feel love in my heart too, just like you."
00:13:56.419,00:13:59.589,I want to be able to express that love with both a man and a woman.
00:13:59.838,00:14:03.468,And I won't be able to if Denny and the Denny Singers get their way.
00:14:03.718,00:14:06.179,"Let the Trunk People have sex and get married, huh!"
00:14:06.387,00:14:08.514,Paid for by Trunk People.
00:14:11.184,00:14:16.481,"Oh, I hope nobody ever gets my hands on me and tries to steal my Strawberry Smiggles."
00:14:16.564,00:14:21.819,I'm gonna eat every last one of them and then they'll be in my stomach and nobody will ever be able to eat them!
00:14:21.986,00:14:24.739,"Except for me, because they're gonna be all inside my stomach."
00:14:24.822,00:14:32.789,My name is Mr. Tophat Jones and God forbid anyone ever take my shmakys-little-people-snibbles.
00:14:32.914,00:14:34.499,I'm keeping them all for me.
00:14:36.000,00:14:37.251,Last bite.
00:14:38.044,00:14:40.171,Now they're all resting comfortably in my stomach.
00:14:40.254,00:14:41.756,"Oh, am I feeling good."
00:14:41.881,00:14:43.966,No! Get away from me! Get away from me.
00:14:44.050,00:14:46.552,Those are my scrumptious Strawberry Snibbles! No!
00:14:51.140,00:14:53.935,My entrails are out! Why would you even want to eat these?
00:14:54.227,00:15:01.526,"They are soaked with my stomach acid! Ah, Jesus Christ, Lord, Savior and Spirit! Save me! Take me to the Light!"
00:15:02.276,00:15:05.530,"Oh, my God! I see demons! I see demons are coming!"
00:15:05.613,00:15:10.284,"Jeez, Rick. Oh, my God! That's some pretty hardcore stuff for a cereal commercial."
00:15:10.535,00:15:11.702,"Well, you know, Morty."
00:15:11.786,00:15:15.081,"I mean, you wanna sell boxes of cereal, you gotta pump the gas a little."
00:15:15.164,00:15:16.457,"Pedal to the metal, Morty."
00:15:21.754,00:15:25.425,There's only three unmuscular Michaels.
00:15:25.550,00:15:27.343,Get down. Hurry. Run.

00:15:45.361,00:15:47.196,-What in the hell? -Sex sells Morty.
00:15:47.280,00:15:51.617,"Sex sells what? Was that a movie? Or, like, does it clean stuff?"
00:15:52.243,00:15:53.953,"Hey, dad. What's going on?"
00:15:54.036,00:15:56.914,"Well, your mother and I are going to be spending some time apart, Morty."
00:15:56.998,00:15:59.500,And your sister found out she was an unwanted pregnancy.
00:16:06.007,00:16:07.175,What about this?
00:16:07.717,00:16:14.724,"Baby Legs, you're a good detective. But not good enough, because of your baby legs. So I'm partnering you up with Regular Legs."
00:16:17.768,00:16:20.521,because I feel like I don't need no regular legged partner.
00:16:20.771,00:16:25.067,"Baby Legs, don't talk back to me. Good luck, there's a criminal to kill."
00:16:30.072,00:16:31.657,"Look, Baby Legs, it's the criminal!"
00:16:31.741,00:16:33.993,"I'm the killer, I'm runnin', I'm runnin' real quick."
00:16:34.285,00:16:36.787,"Baby Legs, here we go!"
00:16:36.913,00:16:38.372,Brrr-rrrrr.
00:16:38.456,00:16:40.583,That's the sound I make when I'm trying to run fast.
00:16:43.044,00:16:46.464,"Alright, I'm not gonna get him, I just learned a real valuable lesson."
00:16:46.589,00:16:47.924,"I'm coming, Baby Legs!"
00:16:48.132,00:16:50.009,I'm Regular Legs!
00:16:51.385,00:16:53.137,-We got him. -That was good teamwork.
00:16:53.346,00:16:56.974,"Baby Legs and Regular Legs, I'm proud of you two for working together."
00:16:57.225,00:17:04.065,"And, Baby Legs, I know it was hard for you to come to the conclusion that you need a partner, -but I'm proud of you that you did it. -Thanks, Chief."
00:17:04.315,00:17:05.274,Now get outta here!
00:17:05.775,00:17:09.070,"-Pretty cool, huh, Morty? -I thought it was cool."
00:17:16.160,00:17:18.579,"Hey, you doing okay?"
00:17:19.664,00:17:22.124,"-I kinda know how you feel, Summer. -No, you don't."
00:17:22.333,00:17:26.337,"You're the little brother, you're not the cause of your parents' misery, you're just a symptom of it."
00:17:27.463,00:17:28.381,Can I show you something?
00:17:28.589,00:17:33.135,"Morty, no offense, but a drawing of me you made when you were 8 isn't gonna make me feel like less of an accident."
00:17:37.014,00:17:38.015,Wait. What?
00:17:38.140,00:17:41.978,"On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world."
00:17:42.103,00:17:49.235,"So we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one, because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed, and in this one, we were dead."
00:17:49.402,00:17:53.114,So we came here and we buried ourselves and we took their place.
00:17:53.239,00:17:58.953,"And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 20 yards away from my own rotting corpse."
00:17:59.203,00:18:01.247,So you're not my brother?
00:18:01.497,00:18:05.960,I'm better than your brother. I'm a version of your brother you can trust when he says don't run.
00:18:06.085,00:18:09.255,Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere.
00:18:09.338,00:18:12.383,Everybody's going to die. Come watch TV.

00:18:29.483,00:18:34.614,"Mrs. Sullivan, please forgive me for being forward, but your eyes are so beautiful."
00:18:35.615,00:18:37.491,Wait this is an actual movie?
00:18:46.751,00:18:48.919,"There's something about you, Mrs. Sullivan."

00:19:22.370,00:19:25.414,"-Don't even think about it. -Come on, are you kidding me, Jerry?"
00:19:25.498,00:19:27.333,It's just a bunch of dumb tabloid crap.
00:19:27.416,00:19:29.752,It's my life and we're watching it.

00:19:42.431,00:19:43.599,Where the hell am I going?
00:19:46.060,00:19:54.735,"I'm sitting here trying to figure out why the cops don't just take you out, I can't believe our tax dollars pay for this."

00:21:33.709,00:21:36.754,"-Yeah, sweetie, that's where they live. -Well, how does that work?"
00:21:36.879,00:21:39.381,"I mean, do the butts look like little apartments inside?"
00:21:39.507,00:21:42.009,"Yeah, and can they leave the butt and walk around on their own?"
00:21:42.343,00:21:44.845,"Look, I don't know. I'm watching the same thing you guys are."
00:21:44.929,00:21:50.351,"Grandpa Rick, if they leave the butt and the person wanders off, how would they find their butt person again?"

00:00:15.891,00:00:20.020,"Well. I mean, traditionally, science fairs are a father/son thing."
00:00:20.145,00:00:22.940,"Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing."
00:00:30.781,00:00:34.576,"-Yeah, dad, why don't we do it together? -Yes."
00:00:34.660,00:00:36.578,"You backed the right horse on this one, son."
00:00:36.662,00:00:40.707,"We'll get out the crayons, brew some coffee and knock this thing out in two or three days."
00:00:47.714,00:00:49.466,Thank you.
00:00:51.385,00:00:53.095,"Dad, I need a ride to work."
00:00:53.178,00:00:57.266,Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I'm helping Morty with science.
00:00:57.391,00:00:59.226,-I'm busy. -Doing what?
00:00:59.351,00:01:01.562,Anything else.
00:01:06.400,00:01:09.152,"-Oh, my god. -Yeah, welcome to the club, pal."
00:01:44.103,00:01:46.398,-Since when do you have a job? -Since last week.
00:01:46.481,00:01:48.191,It's part-time at this little vintage thrift store.
00:01:56.783,00:01:57.701,Please don't.
00:02:00.162,00:02:02.539,When did this stop being Jamba Juice?

00:02:10.005,00:02:12.507,I also know you long for female company.
00:02:12.633,00:02:15.802,You know it has been lonely since the divorce.
00:02:15.886,00:02:18.555,Some voids can't be filled with Jamba Juice.

00:02:34.446,00:02:36.740,"Tell me, Rick, what do you desire?"
00:02:36.865,00:02:40.619,"I make my own stuff. So, what are you, like, the Devil?"
00:02:40.702,00:02:41.620,What? Sorry?
00:02:41.703,00:02:45.332,"I don't know, store comes outta nowhere, all this shit's old and creepy."
00:02:45.457,00:02:48.335,"-Are you the Devil, a demon, leprechaun? -Grandpa Rick!"
00:02:48.543,00:02:51.963,"Hey, I'm not judging, just like to shoot straight, I'm a man of science."
00:02:52.171,00:02:54.173,Then perhaps you could make use of this.
00:02:54.383,00:02:58.679,This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension.
00:03:06.645,00:03:08.647,"Grandpa, go home and drink."
00:03:10.941,00:03:12.859,Why don't we do a model of the solar system?
00:03:12.943,00:03:14.986,That's what my dad did with me when I was your age.
00:03:15.070,00:03:15.946,Okay.
00:03:16.029,00:03:23.202,"You know, Rick's in his lab making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science."

00:03:25.831,00:03:32.087,"Hey, how about we use a ping pong ball for Pluto?, and then Jupiter-- Actually, I don't think Pluto's a planet."
00:03:33.588,00:03:36.758,"Of course Pluto's a planet, son. I learned that in the third grade."
00:03:37.008,00:03:40.429,"-Yeah, but you know, they changed it. -Morty, nobody changed the planets."
00:03:40.679,00:03:45.392,"I just googled it. Pluto's not a planet, they changed it in 2006."
00:03:45.517,00:03:49.229,"Yeah, I heard about that, Morty. And I disagree."
00:03:50.731,00:03:53.817,"That's right. It's possible to disagree in science, Morty."
00:03:53.942,00:03:59.448,"Pluto was a planet, some committee of fancy assholes disagree, I disagree back. Give me a ping pong ball."
00:03:59.531,00:04:02.617,"Okay, I just have to-- Go find Rick and go over my head about Pluto?"
00:04:15.672,00:04:19.468,"Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it?"
00:04:19.551,00:04:23.972,"Rhetorical question, Morty, the answer's yes, you just have to be a genius."
00:04:24.139,00:04:30.812,"Cute. Your sister's boss gave me a microscope -that would've made me retarded. -Oh, boy, Rick, I don't think you're allowed to say that word, you know."
00:04:30.896,00:04:33.190,"Morty, I'm not disparaging the differently abled."
00:04:33.273,00:04:37.569,"I'm stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would've made me mentally retarded."
00:04:37.652,00:04:39.654,"Okay, yeah, but I don't think it's about logic, Rick."
00:04:44.326,00:04:45.535,"Well, that's retarded."
00:04:45.619,00:04:47.537,-What are you guys talking about? -Apparently nothing.
00:04:47.746,00:04:49.623,"You asked him if Pluto's a planet, didn't you?"
00:04:49.831,00:04:50.665,-No. -It's not.
00:04:50.874,00:04:52.167,"-Shut up, Rick! -Whoa."
00:04:52.375,00:04:56.963,"I don't care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again."
00:04:57.047,00:04:59.591,"Planet. Planet, planet, planet!"
00:05:00.217,00:05:02.052,"Stay scientific, Jerry."
00:05:20.946,00:05:22.823,My lust!
00:05:23.782,00:05:25.575,My greed!
00:05:25.700,00:05:28.370,I deserved this.
00:05:31.414,00:05:36.628,"Holy cats! Ladies, let's get outta here! I haven't learned a thing!"
00:05:40.298,00:05:41.800,Sure I did. To develop this.
00:05:48.265,00:05:51.810,"I thought you might want it, so you didn't accidentally sell anybody, say..."

00:06:01.820,00:06:03.697,You're not intentionally selling...
00:06:03.780,00:06:07.993,"beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty, but also makes them blind?"
00:06:08.243,00:06:12.414,"-I find this all quite preposterous. -I say, good sir, oh..."

00:06:21.214,00:06:25.802,"Here, you can use my phone. Don't worry, it won't make you deaf because I'm not a hack."
00:06:27.220,00:06:28.346,No!
00:06:29.681,00:06:32.017,Stop it! No!
00:06:32.100,00:06:35.103,Stop! Stop it right now!
00:06:35.186,00:06:37.022,"Grandpa Rick, I like working here!"
00:06:37.230,00:06:38.315,You work for the Devil!
00:06:38.523,00:06:40.191,-So what? -So what?
00:06:40.442,00:06:44.403,"Yes, so what if he's the Devil, Rick? At least the Devil has a job."
00:06:44.529,00:06:46.823,At least he's active in the community.
00:06:46.948,00:06:50.368,What do you do? You eat our food and make gadgets. Bye.
00:06:55.999,00:06:57.918,"I'm sorry, Mr. Needful. I'll clean that up."
00:06:58.001,00:07:00.545,I don't know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it.
00:07:00.629,00:07:03.340,"It's fine. Summer, you know, your grandfather's right."
00:07:03.422,00:07:05.884,This store curses people. That's my business.
00:07:06.134,00:07:10.263,Fast food gives people diabetes and clothing stores have sweatshops.

00:07:17.896,00:07:20.482,Please. Call me The Devil.
00:07:20.732,00:07:23.777,"-I'd rather not, actually. -Yes, perhaps not during business hours."
00:07:23.985,00:07:27.948,"I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet."
00:07:28.073,00:07:33.787,"Well, then my son's going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I'm suing you first."
00:07:33.870,00:07:36.206,I think I know what the A in NASA stands for.
00:07:36.289,00:07:38.667,"-Dad, what's your end game? -Ain't no game, sucka."
00:07:38.875,00:07:41.753,Why don't we just make the solar system with eight planets? It's even easier.
00:07:42.003,00:07:42.963,"Sure, sure."
00:07:43.046,00:07:46.841,Why don't we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round?

00:08:06.194,00:08:09.322,"I'm King Flippy Nips, ruler of Pluto."
00:08:09.823,00:08:14.452,We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world.
00:08:14.536,00:08:17.414,You really gave it to those guys at NASA.
00:08:17.622,00:08:21.626,"You know, sometimes science is about conviction."
00:08:21.710,00:08:26.214,I'd like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you.
00:08:26.297,00:08:27.549,"Oh, I..."
00:08:28.341,00:08:29.884,Plutonians.

00:08:51.865,00:09:00.874,"If it's athletic prowess you desire, Principal Vagina, I might-- -I'll take it! -But I haven't-- Thank you very, very much. Great store, great place. Bye."
00:09:02.083,00:09:09.966,"Okay. I must say, Summer, I thought your grandfather's outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend I've had since Salem."
00:09:10.091,00:09:12.052,Nice. Wholesome Delight for lunch?
00:09:12.135,00:09:14.220,"-Is that the vegan place? -Yeah, I love their soup."
00:09:14.304,00:09:16.056,I'm kind of souped out.
00:09:16.598,00:09:19.559,"Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire?"
00:09:20.060,00:09:21.895,"Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey."
00:09:22.103,00:09:24.314,"Oh, is there a limit? Everything's free, right?"
00:09:24.564,00:09:27.358,Let's just say you don't pay with money.
00:09:28.568,00:09:31.237,"-That was perfect. -You pay with the curses, right?"
00:09:31.821,00:09:33.490,"Oh, well."
00:09:33.948,00:09:36.242,"But Mrs. Tate, why do you want cursed items?"
00:09:36.493,00:09:39.496,"Well, I'm gonna get the curses removed at Curse Purge Plus."
00:09:39.579,00:09:40.663,"You know, the guy on TV?"
00:09:42.999,00:09:44.167,What?
00:09:44.375,00:09:50.715,"Have you acquired, creepy, specific old stuff from a mysterious antique or thrift store that gives you powers but fucks with you in unforeseeable ways?"
00:09:50.965,00:09:57.472,Bring it to Curse Purge Plus. I use science to uncurse the items for cash and you get to keep the powers!
00:09:57.555,00:10:00.975,"This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster, but guess what?"
00:10:01.059,00:10:04.104,"He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless."
00:10:08.066,00:10:09.400,See you at the Olympics.
00:10:09.484,00:10:12.529,This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family.
00:10:15.490,00:10:17.158,Don't pay for cool stuff with your soul.
00:10:17.242,00:10:20.995,"Pay for it with money, you know, like how every other store in the world works?"
00:10:21.121,00:10:24.582,"We're located at First and Main in old town. Come on, come on down."
00:10:24.666,00:10:26.668,First and...
00:10:29.129,00:10:32.173,"Across the street from Needful Things, where you can get evil items for free."
00:10:32.423,00:10:47.480,"Diabolical son of a mother-- We're back on Good Morning Pluto and a very good morning it is for our guest, Earth scientist Jerry Smith, who's making headlines with his bold announcement that is what, Jerry?"
00:10:47.564,00:10:49.566,-Pluto is a planet. -Wow.
00:10:49.649,00:10:52.485,"-Well, how about that. -I love it."
00:10:52.819,00:10:57.031,Morty Smith? I'm Scroopy Noopers. I'm a scientist. Can I show you something?
00:10:57.115,00:10:59.492,-I better not. -Right now.
00:11:02.537,00:11:06.833,"The center of Pluto, Mister Smith, is made of a substance called Plutonium."
00:11:06.916,00:11:19.304,"Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers and the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks."
00:11:20.679,00:11:22.473,There it goes again. It just shrank a little.
00:11:22.932,00:11:30.815,"But a few years ago, your scientists noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn't call it a planet anymore. It should have been our wake up call."
00:11:31.065,00:11:33.443,But the rich Plutonians won't wake up.
00:11:33.526,00:11:44.579,"And they love your dad telling everyone Pluto's a planet, because that means they can keep mining, until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid, to meteor and finally... poof."
00:11:45.246,00:11:46.705,A party?
00:11:46.956,00:11:50.793,-Is everyone in your family an idiot? -For sure me and my dad are!
00:11:50.877,00:11:56.674,"Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that and you could save four billion lives."
00:12:04.098,00:12:10.021,"Funny. Mister Needful, out of everything in the store you'll never guess what we couldn't get rid of."
00:12:12.232,00:12:13.608,"Oh, my God."
00:12:15.734,00:12:16.611,"Oh, my God."
00:12:16.819,00:12:18.696,I wish this desk was lighter.
00:12:21.824,00:12:23.660,I wish this knot was looser!
00:12:25.662,00:12:27.080,Come on.
00:12:30.667,00:12:32.043,"Wait, what am I doing?"
00:12:32.252,00:12:34.212,I wish I knew CPR!
00:12:34.587,00:12:37.507,"One, two, three."
00:12:39.758,00:12:43.471,"Mr. Needful, how could you even think of doing something so horrible?"
00:12:43.554,00:12:47.016,"I'm the Devil, what should I do when I fail, give myself an ice cream?"
00:12:47.267,00:12:48.393,You haven't failed!
00:12:48.601,00:12:50.979,People like Rick are making me obsolete.
00:12:51.062,00:12:54.941,"I mean, seriously, I may be the Devil, but your grandpa is the Devil."
00:12:58.486,00:13:00.196,No! It's not fair.
00:13:00.280,00:13:03.324,Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you. Even Rick.
00:13:03.825,00:13:06.536,"I was your only friend, and I get nothing?"
00:13:07.036,00:13:09.455,"Okay, I'll give you one thing. Name it."
00:13:09.914,00:13:11.790,I want to help you.
00:13:12.208,00:13:15.461,"-Clever twist. -I learned from the best, you old fart."
00:13:15.628,00:13:17.130,Now let's go get you hydrated.
00:13:17.755,00:13:26.805,"Looks like we've got haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion in 1936, and then you'll be trapped there, winning the same fight for eternity."
00:13:26.889,00:13:31.394,I can take out the eternity and the padding and then you'll have some time traveling mittens.
00:13:31.477,00:13:34.689,"Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby. How's business?"
00:13:34.897,00:13:36.524,Here's the last of our inventory.
00:13:36.607,00:13:39.527,We're going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring.
00:13:39.777,00:13:41.487,"Sounds like code for you win, Rick."
00:13:41.988,00:13:43.448,"That was important to you, wasn't it?"
00:13:43.656,00:13:45.950,Nope. It was important to your dumb devil friend.
00:13:46.034,00:13:49.620,To me this was all just a bit like when Bugs Bunny fucks with the opera singer for 20 minutes.
00:13:51.497,00:13:55.168,Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap.
00:13:55.418,00:13:59.005,"But you know what, Grandpa Rick? He's strong and he's never going to give up."
00:13:59.213,00:14:03.509,"-Yeah, I don't care. -I know. Everyone knows you don't care."
00:14:03.593,00:14:05.928,"-So? -So, have fun not caring."
00:14:06.012,00:14:07.221,-I always do. -Good.
00:14:09.807,00:14:11.100,I'm sure it is.
00:14:11.351,00:14:12.977,-Bye. -Later.
00:14:13.061,00:14:15.313,I'm here to pick up my undead cat and child.
00:14:15.396,00:14:17.856,"Yeah, give me a second."
00:14:20.276,00:14:23.654,"Alright, yeah, put them on my..."
00:14:25.448,00:14:28.242,I just got bored. Everybody out.
00:14:30.828,00:14:32.705,then I promise we'll get back to your science project.
00:14:32.789,00:14:35.750,"Dad. Pluto isn't a planet, it's shrinking because of corporations."
00:14:35.875,00:14:41.964,"Yeah, that's what that anti-planet nut job Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the ministry of money's fundraiser."
00:14:42.173,00:14:44.759,Are you telling me four billion Plutonians are wrong?
00:14:46.761,00:14:48.513,I said science isn't always easy.
00:14:48.596,00:14:52.975,"Obviously that means sometimes it is easy, let's not debase ourselves with word games, son."
00:14:53.226,00:14:58.439,"-Dad, their whole planet is dying. -You called it a planet. Checkmate."
00:14:58.940,00:15:00.900,"What's up, Pluto!"
00:15:04.654,00:15:08.408,"Mr. Smith, please, tell my friend here what you just told me, go on."
00:15:08.491,00:15:12.412,My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles. And the pickles is Pluto.
00:15:13.454,00:15:16.040,My god. The man's a genius!
00:15:16.582,00:15:19.168,-Excuse me. -Morty? What?
00:15:19.419,00:15:31.264,"Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by The Pluto Science Reader linking plutoquakes, sinkholes and surface shrinkage to deep core Plutonium drilling?"
00:15:33.599,00:15:42.358,"Well, son, what did you think when you were five, and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?"
00:15:43.985,00:15:49.198,"I mean, I'm trimming the hedges and these things are just hanging there, was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?"
00:15:49.323,00:15:51.159,"Good one, dad."
00:15:52.243,00:15:54.620,"Hey, Morty, you wanna go on a..."
00:15:56.998,00:15:59.375,"Hey, Jerry? You in here being stupid?"
00:16:05.923,00:16:09.510,"Thanks. Hey, you know, I was thinking, you know, I might watch a movie."
00:16:11.929,00:16:13.139,Suit yourself.
00:16:16.601,00:16:18.811,"Hey, hey. What is going on?"
00:16:19.103,00:16:22.148,"Listen, can you help me do this stupid science fair project?"
00:16:24.525,00:16:28.279,"Jerry, you must be so excited."
00:16:28.362,00:16:32.450,The Plutobel Prize is the highest honor a scientist can receive.
00:16:32.742,00:16:34.494,I'm flattered and humbled.
00:16:34.702,00:16:37.747,"Oh, I like that. Use that in your speech."
00:16:37.830,00:16:41.292,"Also, talk about Pluto being a planet, people like that."
00:16:41.375,00:16:43.252,"You're highness, we've captured Scroopy Noopers."
00:16:43.336,00:16:44.545,You animals. Animals!
00:16:45.755,00:16:49.884,Look whose little journey has come to an end.
00:16:50.092,00:16:51.385,Take him to Plutanamo Bay.
00:16:51.636,00:16:53.971,"You can't kill the truth, father!"
00:16:54.472,00:16:56.891,-What? -I can see you're confused.
00:16:56.974,00:17:00.686,"Plutanamo Bay is a military prison, a sort of play on words."
00:17:00.811,00:17:05.858,"Did he call you father? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nut job, is your son?"
00:17:06.108,00:17:08.611,"The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry."
00:17:08.694,00:17:11.447,"Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf."
00:17:11.697,00:17:13.741,"-It's a what? -Oh, planet!"
00:17:15.284,00:17:19.455,"Pluto is a cold, cold planet. That's what I meant."
00:17:19.580,00:17:22.208,"Knock them dead out there, you."
00:17:24.126,00:17:26.087,Pluto is...
00:17:38.349,00:17:39.642,not a planet.
00:17:41.477,00:17:43.688,It's not a planet! Hey!
00:17:43.938,00:17:48.943,It's not a planet! I'm an idiot and I love my son!
00:17:49.485,00:17:59.036,"It was a long six hours, but we've overhauled Needful Things into the globally compliant, web 4.0 enomenon, N33dful.com!"
00:17:59.120,00:18:01.664,Spelled with threes instead of E's!
00:18:03.666,00:18:06.502,"Okay, that's it, we just got bought by Google!"
00:18:09.046,00:18:13.217,"I'm so proud of you, Lucius. So how much did we make?"
00:18:14.218,00:18:19.348,-We? This is my business. Security. -You're Zuckerberging me?
00:18:19.432,00:18:22.351,I was Zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg's balls dropped.
00:18:22.435,00:18:25.313,"I'm the Devil, bitch! What! What!"
00:18:34.488,00:18:36.866,"-Hey, Morty. -Hey, dad."
00:18:36.949,00:18:39.035,What are you doing back from Pluto so quick?
00:18:39.285,00:18:42.538,Some people just can't handle the truth.
00:18:42.622,00:18:44.415,Especially dummies like me.
00:18:44.540,00:18:50.796,"Morty, I'm not as smart as your Grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again."
00:18:50.921,00:18:55.217,"Hey, dad. Nobody's smarter than Rick, but nobody else is my dad."
00:18:55.301,00:18:56.510,You're a genius at that.
00:18:56.719,00:18:58.262,Wow.
00:19:04.143,00:19:06.437,What's say we finish ourselves an 8 planet solar system?
00:19:06.771,00:19:21.952,"I'm just gonna take this thing in You're a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you're ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean I'm sitting in here, I'm 14, -I got a computer in here, you know? -I think I understand."
00:19:24.914,00:19:26.165,I get it. Say no more.
00:19:26.248,00:19:29.502,"I mean, one of these days, you know, you're gonna end up seeing something."
00:19:29.752,00:19:31.879,I got it! Noted! Good night!
00:19:35.132,00:19:38.302,"How's your pretend grandpa doing, aka the Devil?"
00:19:38.552,00:19:41.639,-He dumped me. -Sorry.
00:19:41.806,00:19:44.767,-Did we learn a lesson I'm not seeing? -Not sure.
00:19:45.101,00:19:49.897,"Maybe in a much bigger way, Mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted?"
00:19:49.980,00:19:55.861,"Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty, and you didn't realize how much you valued my approval?"
00:19:56.737,00:19:58.489,"-No. That's dumb. -Nah, not satisfying."
00:19:58.823,00:20:04.995,"I'll tell you what, though. If it's satisfaction you're after, I think I might have an idea."
00:20:08.040,00:20:09.208,Totally. Let's do it.
00:20:34.233,00:20:39.780,"And that's how I took my storefront into the forefront of the upfront. Thank you, Seattle!"
00:20:42.116,00:20:43.242,Rick? Summer?
00:20:46.454,00:20:49.331,-Stupid motherfucker. -Stupid bitch.
00:20:49.415,00:20:51.292,Stupid motherfucker.
00:20:51.375,00:20:52.960,How do you like that?
00:20:56.422,00:20:57.590,Why?
00:20:57.673,00:21:02.386,"Because sometimes, what you really need is for someone else to pay a horrible price."
00:21:10.895,00:21:12.980,"-We just pulled it off. -Yeah, bro."
00:00:06.589,00:00:10.802,"-So, Dad, guess what tomorrow is? -Martin Luther King Junior's birthday."
00:00:10.927,00:00:13.763,"-No. Well, it might be... -It is."
00:00:13.888,00:00:18.643,"Fine, but also, tomorrow is your one year anniversary back in our lives!"
00:00:18.768,00:00:20.895,I'm gonna make you flying saucer shaped pancakes!
00:00:20.979,00:00:24.315,"There's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine."
00:01:05.815,00:01:08.485,"-Happy anniversary, dad! -Oh, I get it."
00:01:08.610,00:01:12.572,Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers.
00:01:12.697,00:01:16.451,-I should be making you breakfast. -You should be making a whole restaurant.
00:01:16.576,00:01:19.621,Nonsense. We couldn't be happier to have you around.
00:01:19.746,00:01:22.082,I just wish I got to see more of you.
00:01:23.166,00:01:31.841,"Rick Sanchez of Earth dimension C-137, you are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks."
00:01:31.925,00:01:33.760,-What the heck? -Neutralize the Jerry.
00:01:33.843,00:01:38.056,Wait! No! I'll-- -Rick! -Everybody relax.
00:01:38.181,00:01:45.396,"If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes, they just wanna haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with questions. Let's get it over with."
00:01:49.317,00:01:53.404,You lost the right to have a say in this when you refused to join the Council.
00:01:53.530,00:01:54.739,What about Jerry?
00:01:54.864,00:01:57.617,Will you at least unfreeze my daughter's idiot?
00:01:58.535,00:02:01.496,...give you anything! I have a rare antique coin collection!
00:02:01.579,00:02:03.039,Just don't hurt me!
00:02:05.125,00:02:10.130,"OK, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting with little R2D2s instead of George Washingtons."
00:02:10.213,00:02:13.508,-Our son's been abducted! -You hate me for buying those coins!
00:02:16.636,00:02:20.265,"-Geez, Rick, what is this place? -The Citadel of Ricks."
00:02:20.390,00:02:22.976,The secret headquarters for the Council of Ricks.
00:02:23.059,00:02:24.644,Council of Ricks?
00:02:24.769,00:02:32.694,"I've got a lot of enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat: galactic terrorists, a few subgalactic dictators, almost the entire intergalactic government..."
00:02:32.819,00:02:36.573,"Wherever you find people with heads up their asses, someone wants a piece of your grandpa."
00:02:36.698,00:02:39.659,And a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem.
00:02:39.784,00:02:43.872,"So, a few thousand versions of me had the ingenious idea of banding together."
00:02:43.997,00:02:48.918,Like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those who answer questions on Yahoo Answers.
00:02:49.002,00:02:52.964,"-Hey, it's a cowboy version of me! -Geez, you're easy to impress."
00:02:53.047,00:02:55.800,Most timelines have a Rick and most Ricks have a Morty.
00:02:55.884,00:02:58.177,This place is a real who's who of who's you and me.
00:02:58.261,00:03:05.727,"Turn your boring old Morty into a hot fashion statement -with some Morty dazzlers! -Hey, check this out!"
00:03:07.812,00:03:13.943,"Sir, is your Morty insured? Every year, hundreds of Mortys are injured-- Back off! Not my cup of tea, this place."
00:03:14.068,00:03:16.529,I say the point of being a Rick is being a Rick.
00:03:16.654,00:03:20.283,"Save your anti-Rick speech for the Council of Ricks, terror-Rick."
00:03:39.552,00:03:42.889,Bring up the holograms.
00:03:50.188,00:03:53.191,"What say you, Earth Rick C-137?"
00:03:53.316,00:03:54.567,You think I did this?
00:03:54.651,00:03:57.528,Why am I the first you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?
00:04:01.449,00:04:05.703,"Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick. Why isn't he here in handcuffs?"
00:04:09.499,00:04:12.126,Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile.
00:04:12.252,00:04:16.965,"Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve, you're the malcontent, the rogue."
00:04:17.090,00:04:21.219,I'm the Rick. And so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance.
00:04:21.344,00:04:24.472,You wanted to be safe from the government so you became a government.
00:04:24.597,00:04:26.474,That makes all of you less Rick than me.
00:04:28.309,00:04:29.852,"Yeah, murmur it up, D-Bags."
00:04:29.936,00:04:33.231,"If you'll excuse me, I've got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them."
00:04:33.356,00:04:37.235,They're about to hit the point of syrup-absorption that turns them into a gross paste.
00:04:37.318,00:04:42.115,"I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like fluffy discs of cake with syrup on top."
00:04:42.240,00:04:46.327,And I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there's evidence.
00:04:46.452,00:04:48.997,"So, as they say in Canada: Peace Ooot!"
00:04:49.080,00:04:51.165,Evidence? Good idea.
00:04:51.249,00:04:52.667,Scan his portal gun.
00:04:53.251,00:04:56.254,"Aw, come on, don't look at another man's portal gun history."
00:04:56.337,00:04:58.047,We all go to weird places.
00:04:58.798,00:05:05.888,"Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occurred."
00:05:05.972,00:05:09.392,What? That's rick-diculous. I'm obviously being set up!
00:05:09.517,00:05:23.698,"Earth Rick C-137, the Council of Ricks sentences you to The Machine of Unspeakable Doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you've known becomes impossible to grasp."
00:05:23.865,00:05:26.284,"Also, every ten seconds, it stabs your balls."
00:05:26.367,00:05:27.535,I've heard enough.
00:05:32.498,00:05:33.624,"Ah, ah, not you."
00:05:39.213,00:05:40.214,No!
00:06:03.988,00:06:07.325,"I'd like to order one large person with extra people, please."
00:06:07.450,00:06:10.995,"White people. No, no! Black people. And Hispanic on half."
00:06:22.548,00:06:26.094,"Yes, I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair please."
00:06:26.219,00:06:29.764,"High chair. No, no! Recliner. And wheelchair on half."
00:06:42.068,00:06:44.237,They could have gone into any one of these.
00:06:44.320,00:06:45.404,"Aw, son of a--!"
00:06:45.530,00:06:47.824,"-Aw, geez! We lost 'em! -Aw man!"
00:06:47.949,00:06:50.785,"I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones, please."
00:06:50.868,00:06:55.206,"Cell phone. No, no! Rotary. And pay phone on half."
00:06:59.669,00:07:04.715,"Those guys were wrong, right? You wouldn't kill yourself... yourselves."
00:07:04.841,00:07:13.349,"Of course not. How could that profit me? But someone out there is killing Ricks, and the Council ain't going to stop thinking it's me until we find the real Rick killer."
00:07:13.474,00:07:17.812,Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons like in Doomsday Preppers.
00:07:17.937,00:07:21.941,"Not really my style. Besides, your home must be swarming with Ricks by now."
00:07:24.360,00:07:29.031,"Listen, Jerry. If Rick calls, this device is gonna trace his location."
00:07:31.951,00:07:34.412,"-Who wants lemonade? -Oh, yeah!"
00:07:39.167,00:07:45.089,"I have a Beth just like you in my reality, except she's not as brilliant or attractive."
00:07:54.974,00:07:55.975,Hello?
00:08:00.313,00:08:07.278,"Listen, the heat's on and there's nowhere left to turn, so Morty and I are gonna fly my spaceship into a black hole."
00:08:11.574,00:08:13.201,inside the house!
00:08:15.870,00:08:19.165,-I can't believe our daughter married you. -Too easy!
00:08:19.457,00:08:25.505,"The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry, but as soon as they get bored, they'll be on to us."
00:08:25.630,00:08:28.674,Phones a la clams and phonesghetti with phone balls. Anything else?
00:08:28.799,00:08:31.010,"-More phone sticks please. -Right away, sir."
00:08:36.599,00:08:41.604,But our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines.
00:08:41.687,00:08:43.981,It's got to be that way. You're our camouflage.
00:08:44.065,00:08:47.068,"Camouflage? What are you talking about, Rick?"
00:08:47.318,00:08:50.321,Ricks have a very distinctive brainwave due to our genius.
00:08:50.446,00:08:55.409,Standing near someone with complimentary brainwaves makes ours invisible.
00:08:55.535,00:09:01.165,"See? When a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get cancelled out by the, uh..."
00:09:03.626,00:09:07.171,Because... our personalities are so different?
00:09:07.296,00:09:11.008,"Oh shit, dog! My portal gun was hacked remotely."
00:09:11.133,00:09:13.386,"Obviously by the real killer, to frame me."
00:09:13.469,00:09:16.222,"But I was able to trace the signal. Come on, let's go!"
00:09:16.430,00:09:20.268,We've tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location.
00:09:20.393,00:09:25.231,"They look exactly like us, so to avoid confusion, I'm going to mark us each with a red X."
00:09:25.356,00:09:31.737,"So if we both tell you to shoot the other one because they're the evil one, -you'll know who's lying. -Check it out!"
00:09:33.614,00:09:34.740,Damn it!
00:09:41.163,00:09:45.251,It's a good thing that space outlet had lab coats and your shirt in stock.
00:09:45.376,00:09:48.588,"I heard you the first time, you don't have to keep saying it."
00:09:48.713,00:09:52.091,This place is way off the grid. This guy does not want to be found.
00:09:52.216,00:09:55.219,"If he's a Rick, doesn't he just have to stand by a Morty to hide?"
00:09:55.344,00:09:58.139,"Isn't that what we are, human cloaking devices?"
00:09:58.222,00:10:00.266,You're making a bigger deal out of this than it is.
00:10:02.226,00:10:03.853,"Oh my god, Rick, look!"
00:10:03.936,00:10:06.647,There's a bunch of people strapped all over that building!
00:10:06.772,00:10:09.692,"Not people, Morty. Mortys!"
00:10:17.283,00:10:19.910,Why would somebody do this? It's horrible!
00:10:19.994,00:10:28.252,"One Morty can hide you from the bureaucrats, but a whole matrix of Mortys in agonizing pain creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks."
00:10:31.964,00:10:36.135,"On paper, Morty! On paper! I wouldn't do this. It's barbaric overkill."
00:10:36.260,00:10:40.681,"I mean, you could accomplish the same with like five Mortys and a jumper cable."
00:10:41.724,00:10:45.978,"Which I also wouldn't do. I'm just saying, it's bad craftsmanship."
00:10:52.401,00:10:54.945,"-Hi, Jerry. -Leave me alone, I'm working."
00:10:55.071,00:11:00.034,"-Oh, you are? What do you do? -I'm in between advertising jobs."
00:11:00.201,00:11:01.994,Advertising? Wow!
00:11:02.078,00:11:05.665,"So, people need help figurin' out what to buy and then you help them?"
00:11:05.748,00:11:08.334,It's a little more complicated than that.
00:11:08.542,00:11:12.380,"Well I mean, you do it and you seem like a guy who really has it all together."
00:11:15.091,00:11:17.551,"Dude, are you... You're being a dick, right?"
00:11:17.635,00:11:21.555,"Oh, gosh, I hope not! I wouldn't want to offend you in any way."
00:11:25.434,00:11:27.853,Just as much as my Morty's a Morty!
00:11:27.978,00:11:31.482,He looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie Mask.
00:11:31.565,00:11:33.150,"You know, the one with Cher in it."
00:11:33.234,00:11:37.905,That's right. He's from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz Mask people.
00:11:37.988,00:11:39.782,He's Eric Stoltz Mask Morty.
00:11:39.865,00:11:42.993,They assigned him to me because I never had any kids of my own.
00:11:43.077,00:11:47.748,"but if I did, I'd love 'em if they were as smart and as successful as you are."
00:11:47.873,00:11:51.168,"Hey, get a load of this. Jerry's hanging out with Doofus Rick."
00:11:51.252,00:11:52.336,This is perfect!
00:11:52.420,00:11:55.631,I'm not Doofus Rick! I'm Rick J19-Zeta-7!
00:11:55.756,00:11:59.552,Is that the timeline where people eat poop? You know this guy eats poop?
00:11:59.760,00:12:03.681,"Hey, I don't eat poop! You guys are always so mean to me!"
00:12:05.850,00:12:10.146,"I guess it's only fair to tell you now, I'm the worst Rick of them all."
00:12:10.229,00:12:12.481,According to who? Other versions of you?
00:12:12.606,00:12:17.570,"If I've learned one thing, it's that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to yourself."
00:12:17.695,00:12:22.199,"Wow, you really are wise, Jerry. I guess that's why you work in advertising!"
00:12:22.324,00:12:26.203,The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all.
00:12:26.328,00:12:30.166,You don't care about me at all! I'm no different than that jacket you've got on!
00:12:30.249,00:12:32.126,Or your stupid portal gun!
00:12:32.251,00:12:34.628,I'm just a tool! I'm just an object!
00:12:34.753,00:12:40.301,"It's your choice to take it personally, but now be quiet. The point of this is to get the drop on the guy."
00:12:40.426,00:12:43.095,I'll tell you something. I'm more than a human shield!
00:12:43.262,00:12:49.518,"Yeah, you are. You're a perfect impenetrable suit of human armor, because you're as dumb as I am smart."
00:12:49.643,00:12:52.813,"Which is why, when I say shut up, it's really good advice!"
00:13:09.997,00:13:13.667,"Oh, look at you, C-137. You, aren't you a tough customer."
00:13:13.792,00:13:16.587,"The slow clap? Really? Kinda played out, dude."
00:13:16.712,00:13:18.547,Not in this dimension it isn't.
00:13:18.631,00:13:22.134,"In fact, I invented it. Nobody else has ever even done it here before."
00:13:22.218,00:13:24.720,"-Well, la-di-da. -Hey! That's mine."
00:13:29.141,00:13:31.769,I don't like the look of that Rick. We gotta escape.
00:13:31.894,00:13:36.023,"-I'm not gonna help you. You're a monster. -Don't be rick-diculous, Morty."
00:13:36.190,00:13:39.485,-Stop saying that. It's stupid. -Take his Morty away.
00:13:44.156,00:13:46.242,You seem to know how this place works.
00:13:46.325,00:13:49.787,Is there any way to shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys outside?
00:13:49.870,00:13:53.749,It would be pointless. Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick.
00:14:04.301,00:14:06.262,"Ah, isn't it beautiful?"
00:14:06.387,00:14:09.974,"Yeah, it looks like pay day at Neverland Ranch in here. Zing!"
00:14:11.350,00:14:15.396,"-That guy got it. -Rick, quiet. You're missing my symphony."
00:14:21.986,00:14:25.114,-This guy is on it! -He's not laughing at your dumb jokes.
00:14:30.160,00:14:33.289,"Ya see, Rick, you're not as clever as you think you are."
00:14:36.750,00:14:38.252,"Yeah, duh."
00:14:38.377,00:14:39.920,"Ya see this right here, Rick?"
00:14:40.004,00:14:46.218,"I crunched the numbers. I created a spectrum of all the Ricks, I listed 'em out from most evil to least evil."
00:14:46.343,00:14:49.972,"Here's where I am, and look at right here's where you are, Rick."
00:14:50.139,00:14:52.558,This guy right here: super weird.
00:14:52.683,00:14:57.062,"So you want me to team up with you to take down the Council of Ricks, right?"
00:14:57.187,00:15:01.358,-That's where I'd be going. -I think I'm doing pretty good on my own.
00:15:01.483,00:15:04.945,I'm simply gonna download the contents of your brain and then kill you.
00:15:06.947,00:15:12.161,If we add a little more titanium nitrate and just a tad of chlorified tartrate...
00:15:13.621,00:15:15.414,Oven-less brownies!
00:15:15.873,00:15:16.874,Mm!
00:15:17.333,00:15:21.045,It's incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order.
00:15:21.170,00:15:23.714,"Well, come on, I can't take all the credit Jerry."
00:15:23.797,00:15:26.592,"It was your idea! Come here, Jerry."
00:15:30.512,00:15:34.183,"Hey, come here. I want to show you something."
00:15:35.184,00:15:39.939,"Look, everybody makes fun of me, but you're a genius scientist. What do you think?"
00:15:40.064,00:15:43.025,There's little R2D2s where the George Washingtons should be!
00:15:43.901,00:15:48.989,"I'm not going to tell you that these will increase in value, or even hold their current value."
00:15:49.073,00:15:51.575,"The truth is, you bought 'em because you like 'em."
00:15:51.700,00:15:54.495,They have value to you. That's what matters.
00:16:00.918,00:16:04.505,I found mine. I found mine.
00:16:06.465,00:16:09.176,"-Help! -There is no escape, my son."
00:16:09.301,00:16:11.887,We will find our peace in the next world.
00:16:11.971,00:16:14.014,"So, what, you're just gonna give up?"
00:16:14.139,00:16:17.559,We're giving in. To the power of the one true Morty!
00:16:24.942,00:16:27.027,"Alright, Mortys, listen up!"
00:16:27.111,00:16:30.864,"My name is Morty Smith, from Earth Dimension C-137."
00:16:30.990,00:16:35.536,"I know you're scared, me too, but that's no reason to accept our fate!"
00:16:35.661,00:16:39.373,We're Mortys! We're not defined by our relationships to Rick.
00:16:39.498,00:16:41.542,Our destiny is our own.
00:16:41.667,00:16:44.211,This sounds like something the one true Morty might say.
00:16:44.294,00:16:47.881,I'm sick of being a human shield. I wanna be a gardener!
00:16:48.007,00:16:51.593,"I want to write really crazy, intense action novels!"
00:16:51.719,00:16:55.597,-I'm more than just a hammer! -He is the one true Morty!
00:17:09.153,00:17:11.280,"You've lived quite a life, Rick."
00:17:11.363,00:17:14.158,It's a shame you're not gonna be around to see it through.
00:17:22.875,00:17:26.962,"-You're crying? Over a Morty? -No, I'm just allergic to dipshits."
00:17:27.087,00:17:28.630,"Ugh, pathetic."
00:17:28.714,00:17:33.802,"We both know that if there's any truth in the universe, it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys."
00:17:37.264,00:17:39.433,"Do your worst, you little bastards!"
00:17:42.770,00:17:46.982,Morty! Thank God! Get me out of this. Come on!
00:17:47.107,00:17:48.609,You're lucky I'm not a Rick.
00:17:48.692,00:17:50.861,Point taken but this is no time for arcs.
00:18:00.704,00:18:03.290,-Hello? -What do me and O.J. not have in common?
00:18:03.415,00:18:04.833,Huh? Who is this?
00:18:10.881,00:18:13.717,"Yo, ding dong, we're done here, time to go."
00:18:21.600,00:18:23.644,"We could maybe, you know, get rid of him."
00:18:23.852,00:18:34.029,"I'm not saying kill him necessarily, I'm also not saying necessarily not kill him, but-- Jerry, we both know it wouldn't work. It's time to go back to our lives."
00:18:34.822,00:18:37.032,"I love ya, Jerry. I love ya."
00:18:59.263,00:19:08.021,"-What's gonna happen to all these Mortys? -They'll go back to their families, attend school regularly, play video games, date girls..."
00:19:08.313,00:19:10.941,Poor little Rickless bastards.
00:19:13.443,00:19:16.196,the council apologizes for its false accusation.
00:19:20.033,00:19:29.585,"we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free, replacement Morty in the event that your current Morty should-- Uh, guys? Not a good time."
00:19:29.710,00:19:31.295,"Come on, Morty, let's hit it."
00:19:33.881,00:19:35.966,"Is it time for arcs, yet, Rick?"
00:19:36.049,00:19:38.927,I did a pretty good job back there for a human cloaking device.
00:19:39.052,00:19:42.848,-Saved your ass. -Don't break an arm jerking yourself off.
00:19:42.973,00:19:44.558,"Man, I can't believe you!"
00:19:44.641,00:19:49.479,"That was a great opportunity to show a little humanity, to connect with me a little."
00:19:49.563,00:19:53.525,"You want connection, go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb Ricks."
00:19:53.609,00:19:56.069,Maybe I don't connect because I'm the Rickest Rick there is.
00:19:59.072,00:20:02.201,that the Rickest Rick would have the Mortiest Morty.
00:20:02.326,00:20:05.996,"-It would go without saying, huh? -Yeah, did you hear me say it?"
00:20:06.121,00:20:09.166,Nah. The Mortiest Morty...
00:20:09.249,00:20:11.752,"Just don't get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown."
00:20:11.877,00:20:15.714,A cocky Morty can be a real bad thing for everybody.
00:20:15.839,00:20:16.965,"Oh yeah, how's that?"
00:20:17.090,00:20:19.468,I'll explain when you're older.
00:20:21.762,00:20:24.806,-What a mess. -Pride cometh before the fall.
00:20:24.932,00:20:28.560,-I guess he got what he deserved. -What is that?
00:20:28.685,00:20:32.022,"-Hand me the laser defibrillator. -Hey, guys, can I help?"
00:20:32.147,00:20:35.359,No. Go clean the toilets. Maybe you'll make friends with some turds.
00:20:35.484,00:20:37.486,You make us ashamed to be ourselves.
00:20:39.655,00:20:42.699,My God! I've seen this technology before.
00:20:47.079,00:20:50.916,"-This is the receiver. -Yeah, but where's the transmitter?"
00:21:39.965,00:21:41.508,Wubba dubba dub dub!
00:21:42.050,00:21:45.429,"-What are you doing in my room, buddy? -Nothing."
00:21:45.554,00:21:48.724,I was just... checking the smoke detectors.
00:21:49.141,00:21:50.934,Alright. Okay. Get out.
00:22:13.248,00:22:16.460,What's that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him?
00:22:16.585,00:22:19.963,"You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh my God, this is rich!"
00:22:20.088,00:22:23.050,"I've got like, ten Ricks to call right now."
00:00:06.048,00:00:07.633,"-Bye, mom! Bye, dad! -Drive carefully!"
00:00:07.716,00:00:08.842,"Have fun, you two."
00:00:08.967,00:00:13.931,"Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our... Titanic-themed getaway."
00:00:14.056,00:00:17.267,"Let's lose the 'tude, please, it's supposed to be romantic."
00:00:17.392,00:00:20.187,"Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge."
00:00:20.312,00:00:21.647,Can we wrap this up?
00:00:21.730,00:00:24.858,Morty and I have some synthetic laser eels oxidizing in the garage.
00:00:24.983,00:00:28.362,"Hey, don't blow me off, I am drawing a line. Okay?"
00:00:28.487,00:00:32.533,"Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and..."
00:00:32.658,00:00:34.618,no more adventures with Morty.
00:00:34.743,00:00:38.830,"If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time."
00:00:38.956,00:00:40.374,"-That's right. -Wait, what?"
00:00:40.499,00:00:44.294,"Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine."
00:00:44.419,00:00:48.298,"If not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It's like that song..."
00:00:51.050,00:00:53.595,You guys know that song? From Tiny Rogerts?
00:00:53.720,00:00:57.516,"You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the 50s?"
00:00:57.641,00:00:58.934,Nobody?
00:00:59.059,00:01:02.604,"Alright, whatever. Look, who cares. Just go on your stupid trip."
00:01:02.938,00:01:05.148,Not one thing out of place.
00:01:08.819,00:01:11.488,Not a single thing.
00:01:21.623,00:01:24.918,"Well, we're past the point of no return, I'm going to have a party."
00:01:57.326,00:01:59.703,I found Jell-O. Can you sneak your mom's vodka?
00:01:59.828,00:02:02.039,"Yes, she does, I saw it in your laundry room."
00:02:02.164,00:02:05.292,"Listen, you can't both be in denial about it. Okay, bye."
00:02:08.503,00:02:11.632,"If anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished."
00:02:11.757,00:02:12.883,I'm only a human being.
00:02:13.008,00:02:14.968,"Rick, tell Summer she can't have a party!"
00:02:20.432,00:02:21.808,"What? Rick, you can't!"
00:02:21.933,00:02:23.894,What do you mean you're having a party?
00:02:28.357,00:02:31.193,You're lucky a Traflorkian doesn't hear you say that.
00:02:31.318,00:02:36.490,-Is that like their N-Word? -It's like the N-word and the C-word had a baby and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews.
00:02:36.615,00:02:45.165,"I think we could just have a nice time, like just hanging out, and doing a little bonding-- Screw that! This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids."
00:02:45.290,00:02:47.626,"That's why you party? Boy, you really are 17."
00:02:52.130,00:02:55.174,Just keep your sci-fi friends away from my awesome ones.
00:02:55.300,00:02:59.513,"Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapés."
00:03:09.231,00:03:13.568,A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive.
00:03:13.694,00:03:21.326,-Are you sure the ship will sink? -I can assure you the ship will sink as it has a thousand times before. It is un-unsinkable.
00:03:22.703,00:03:24.996,"Look, it's the line for the bow!"
00:03:25.122,00:03:28.542,"Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a Margarita and read."
00:03:28.667,00:03:31.210,Do you mind if I skip the whole King of the World bit?
00:03:31.336,00:03:34.213,"Well, it's not that bit, that's Jack and Fabrizio."
00:03:34.339,00:03:36.508,"This is where Rose says: I'm flying, Jack!"
00:03:36.591,00:03:38.927,"But whatever, I can be the only one to do it alone."
00:03:39.010,00:03:43.014,"Well, what about her? Excuse me, ma'am. Would you like to take my place in line?"
00:03:43.140,00:03:47.144,-I... could get into trouble. -We won't tell.
00:03:48.061,00:03:50.439,So... you're a Titanic fanatic?
00:03:50.564,00:03:55.026,"Oh, yes. I've worked here since it opened but I've never been able to participate."
00:03:59.156,00:04:02.868,I love watching bukkake. I don't know if I personally would ever do it...
00:04:02.993,00:04:04.828,-Brad! Hey! -Yo.
00:04:04.953,00:04:07.497,"Brad is here! Quick, make my hair look drunk!"
00:04:07.622,00:04:11.376,Check it out! Tammy's already drunk. Cool.
00:04:13.170,00:04:15.630,"The beacon was activated, who is in danger?"
00:04:18.675,00:04:22.304,-I am pleased there is no emergency. -There's an emergency alright.
00:04:25.766,00:04:29.144,It has been a challenging mating season for Birdperson.
00:04:29.269,00:04:31.563,Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight.
00:04:31.646,00:04:33.565,"Go have some fun out there, Birdperson."
00:04:33.690,00:04:36.401,"Oh, man! How many people did you invite, Rick?"
00:04:36.526,00:04:37.527,Uh... people?
00:04:37.652,00:04:38.987,Six.
00:04:40.238,00:04:43.408,"-Yo, what up, my glip glops! -Oh, man!"
00:04:48.580,00:04:50.916,"You know there's a garbage, right?"
00:04:53.210,00:04:54.753,Hey... What the hell?
00:04:54.878,00:04:59.299,That's why you never invite a Floopy Doop and a Shmoopy Doop to the same party.
00:05:02.761,00:05:06.139,"Oh, Go--, oh! that's disgusting, you guys are in my parents' bed!"
00:05:06.264,00:05:10.227,"Oh, sorry. I'm not feeling too well. I just needed to lie down for a bit."
00:05:14.356,00:05:16.316,"Oh my god, are you kidding me?"
00:05:16.441,00:05:23.740,The thing people don't realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all.
00:05:23.865,00:05:31.665,"-Yeah. No, totally. -Rick! You gotta stop-- -Morty! Have you met Gearhead? -Hey how's-- Morty would love to hear all about the Gear Wars."
00:05:31.790,00:05:35.126,How familiar are you with the Gear Wars exactly?
00:05:35.210,00:05:38.880,"-Uh... Not at all. -Oh, boy! I envy you."
00:05:39.005,00:05:42.926,"Okay, it was about 754 years ago..."
00:05:49.933,00:05:52.561,"Hey, Morty! Have you met my buddy Scropon?"
00:05:52.686,00:05:57.649,"Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, and meanwhile, the house is being destroyed!"
00:05:57.774,00:06:01.152,This guy's entire planet was destroyed. Have a little perspective.
00:06:04.614,00:06:07.409,Is there a good place for me to squanch around here?
00:06:09.578,00:06:13.957,"-Mi casa es su casa, dog. -Alright! I like your squanch!"
00:06:14.082,00:06:16.626,"Rick, what exactly is squanching?"
00:06:16.960,00:06:21.548,"Morty, we've had many really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax."
00:06:21.673,00:06:24.426,"If I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures."
00:06:24.551,00:06:26.011,"Jesus, you're bumming me out!"
00:06:26.136,00:06:31.349,"Can't we pretend everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and worry about all this later?"
00:06:31.474,00:06:33.101,"That's easy for you to say, Rick!"
00:06:33.226,00:06:37.898,"You like not caring about stuff, you know, what's in this for me?"
00:06:47.198,00:06:49.242,"Knock it off, Slow Mobius!"
00:06:55.624,00:06:57.125,I can't believe she's here.
00:06:57.208,00:06:59.961,What are you doing standing here? Go! Talk to her!
00:07:00.086,00:07:03.173,"Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood."
00:07:11.723,00:07:13.558,-Is that what I think it is? -Yes.
00:07:21.024,00:07:24.277,"With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be interested..."
00:07:31.201,00:07:36.289,"-Uh, sir? There's not a problem. -What do you mean, there's not a problem?"
00:07:36.414,00:07:39.250,The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course.
00:07:39.376,00:07:43.004,This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg.
00:07:49.761,00:07:53.765,It's too late. Ladies and gentlemen... don't brace yourselves.
00:07:58.937,00:08:00.897,-We're not gonna sink! -What are we going to do?
00:08:02.107,00:08:04.109,Gonna get laid tonight.
00:08:04.859,00:08:09.739,-I like your feathers. -They are designed -to attract the attention of the female. -It's working.
00:08:09.864,00:08:15.412,"Tammy, I should let you know, I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate."
00:08:15.537,00:08:20.542,I'm not looking to get into a soul bond. I'm just looking for...
00:08:20.667,00:08:23.128,I believe Birdperson can arrange that.
00:08:23.253,00:08:25.797,Summer! Haven't seen you at flute practice in a while.
00:08:25.922,00:08:28.383,"Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her?"
00:08:28.508,00:08:31.052,Are you kidding me? I don't even know why she's here.
00:08:31.177,00:08:35.181,"Whoa, not cool, Summer. This is a party, everybody should be welcome."
00:08:37.225,00:08:41.688,-Great... Who invited Abradolf Lincler? -I thought everyone was welcome.
00:08:44.983,00:08:51.197,Just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral super leader combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln.
00:08:54.826,00:08:57.620,Rick! You brought me into this world.
00:09:02.250,00:09:09.716,"But I shall finally know peace -Whoa! What's up, man? -I have no quarrel with you, boy."
00:09:09.841,00:09:11.801,Boy? What's that supposed to mean?
00:09:11.926,00:09:15.555,"It's just... look, I don't know how you thought I meant it, but..."
00:09:15.680,00:09:16.973,"Don't look at me, dude."
00:09:20.101,00:09:22.270,I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?
00:09:22.395,00:09:25.065,"Well, no, but, you know..."
00:09:25.190,00:09:28.610,What do I know? That the Third Reich will reign for a thousand years?
00:09:28.693,00:09:30.820,"-Leave him alone. -Stay out of this, Jessica!"
00:09:36.034,00:09:39.037,-Brad! -Kick his ass!
00:09:40.038,00:09:42.832,"-Rick! -I just did you a favor, Morty."
00:09:44.959,00:09:48.338,Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends.
00:09:48.463,00:09:52.592,Brad is such a jerk. He's always trying to prove what a man he is.
00:09:52.717,00:09:55.345,I just want to find somebody nice and sweet.
00:09:55.804,00:09:58.473,"Jessica, can I show you something?"
00:10:00.100,00:10:02.560,Wow! Look at all this stuff!
00:10:02.685,00:10:06.648,"Yeah, this is me and my grandpa's sci-fi workshop. Check this out."
00:10:09.192,00:10:10.819,It's beautiful.
00:10:10.944,00:10:14.280,"You know, there's something I've always wanted to tell you."
00:10:14.405,00:10:20.703,"-What's that, Morty? -I think that you're the most-- No, that! Those weird sounds coming from the closet over there."
00:10:27.418,00:10:29.587,-Oh my god! -Hey! I'm squanching in here!
00:10:29.712,00:10:32.674,"Oh, my God, I'm... That is so disgusting! Ow!"
00:10:32.799,00:10:34.050,"Oh, crap!"
00:10:57.240,00:10:58.867,Giant testicle monsters.
00:10:58.950,00:11:00.618,We'll be fine. Let's party!
00:11:13.882,00:11:19.470,"I swear to God, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now."
00:11:25.268,00:11:27.854,The whole house is sitting in another dimension!
00:11:27.979,00:11:32.400,What the hell are we supposed to do? Mom and dad will kill us! I'm losing it!
00:11:32.525,00:11:36.029,"Relax, Morty, relax. It's gonna be fine."
00:11:36.154,00:11:40.200,All we have to do is go out and find us some Kalaxian crystals.
00:11:42.619,00:11:45.704,"Kalaxian Crystals, Morty! Just a few miles south of here!"
00:11:45.830,00:11:49.125,"Okay, let's go then. We gotta go get those crystals right now."
00:11:49.250,00:11:51.628,"Whoa, Morty! I can't go with you."
00:11:51.753,00:11:54.464,I gotta hang back and make sure everything stays cool here.
00:11:54.589,00:11:57.592,Who knows? What if somebody breaks something.
00:11:59.677,00:12:02.639,"-You guys have any aspirin? -Oh, hey! This is perfect!"
00:12:02.764,00:12:06.226,"-You can take Lincler with you! -I'm not going anywhere, I'm injured."
00:12:06.351,00:12:10.230,"Shut up, Lincler. It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room."
00:12:10.355,00:12:14.651,"-Yeah, and Nancy, you should go too! -What? Why me?"
00:12:14.776,00:12:20.031,Because... uh... you're so good at playing the flute!
00:12:31.876,00:12:35.672,"Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall's been broken."
00:12:38.757,00:12:41.135,"-You should find that Lucy woman. -But, but..."
00:12:45.181,00:12:49.560,"Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater."
00:12:51.437,00:12:53.982,This trip has been a titanic failure. Get it?
00:12:55.400,00:12:59.487,"-Draw me, Jerry. -Oh, boy. Lucy... wow!"
00:13:02.073,00:13:03.449,But it's the perfect moment.
00:13:03.533,00:13:06.077,We've been dreaming about this for 16 years!
00:13:06.202,00:13:09.747,Um... not like this. Not with you.
00:13:09.872,00:13:11.040,You are gonna draw me!
00:13:15.962,00:13:23.928,"It's weird cause I definitely think that all men are created equal, -but at the same time... -The crystals should be really close."
00:13:24.053,00:13:25.054,There they are!
00:13:26.055,00:13:28.807,Wait! Something's not right.
00:13:32.145,00:13:34.188,Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast.
00:13:34.314,00:13:37.900,Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes.
00:13:40.403,00:13:42.238,Summer's gonna like me again!
00:13:48.536,00:13:53.666,"-Lincler, come on, let's get outta here! -Mein journey is over, Morty."
00:13:53.791,00:13:56.794,I have something important to tell you...
00:14:06.346,00:14:10.141,"-Rick, I got 'em! I got the crystals! -Alright! You did it, Morty!"
00:14:10.266,00:14:14.312,Wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincler.
00:14:14.437,00:14:17.398,He said that he was sorry and that he loves you like a father.
00:14:17.523,00:14:21.736,He only wanted you to accept him and hopes that his final act would redeem him.
00:14:21.861,00:14:25.573,"He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died."
00:14:25.698,00:14:29.118,Well at least he didn't die in vain. He got these crystals.
00:14:31.662,00:14:35.208,And these babies just saved this lame ass party! Wubba lubba dub dub!
00:14:35.291,00:14:37.085,Somebody play something.
00:14:37.794,00:14:39.170,"Wait a minute, what?"
00:15:02.777,00:15:05.571,"Slow Mobius, hit me with the clock beam!"
00:15:13.913,00:15:15.665,That's the Rick dance!
00:15:20.837,00:15:23.798,I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home!
00:15:23.923,00:15:26.217,What? No. I can get us home whenever I want to.
00:15:26.300,00:15:28.636,Speaking of those crystals... can I get the rest?
00:15:28.761,00:15:30.304,I'm starting to come down.
00:15:30.430,00:15:33.933,Crystal Kalaxian is a really strong but fleeting high.
00:15:35.059,00:15:38.855,"-That's what I think of your crystals! -Aw, Morty, you idiot!"
00:15:38.980,00:15:41.023,Does anybody else have any more KLax?
00:15:41.149,00:15:44.193,-Birdperson? Squanchy? -Don't squanch at me.
00:15:44.318,00:15:48.531,"Alright everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home. Now!"
00:15:48.656,00:15:51.701,"Alright, fine, Morty. You party pooper buzzkill."
00:15:51.826,00:15:55.288,"-Boooo, booo! Morty sucks! -You suck, whatever your name is."
00:15:57.081,00:15:59.542,But these gears just started turnin'!
00:15:59.667,00:16:01.377,"Almost finished, Jerry?"
00:16:02.253,00:16:06.632,Almost! I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes.
00:16:06.757,00:16:08.342,I'm sure it's good enough. Move!
00:16:08.468,00:16:14.557,"Every weekend Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car, and I have to mop it up."
00:16:14.682,00:16:17.560,The floor drops out to make it easier.
00:16:17.685,00:16:21.981,But now it's my turn. We're going to get it nice and steamy in there.
00:16:22.106,00:16:32.074,And I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint and then you're going to love inside of me. No mess. No clean.
00:16:32.200,00:16:33.034,Beth!
00:16:33.117,00:16:35.870,Bet you're glad I think Kindles are dumb now.
00:16:39.874,00:16:41.876,I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.
00:16:42.001,00:16:43.878,What does a rapist look like exactly?
00:16:44.003,00:16:51.844,Is it a Slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister pocked lips?
00:16:51.969,00:16:53.012,What?
00:16:53.971,00:16:55.932,At least you got all this free stuff.
00:16:56.057,00:17:00.102,Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic jones for a while.
00:17:00.228,00:17:01.812,I'm not going to fit.
00:17:01.896,00:17:03.272,"Beth, listen to me."
00:17:03.356,00:17:09.362,"You're going to get outta here. You're gonna go on-- -Jerry, just leave the door. -It's not a door. It's debris."
00:17:09.487,00:17:13.533,"-I don't care, just leave it. -Yeah, okay."
00:17:22.208,00:17:26.546,Cape Fear! I'm going to do like from Cape Fear!
00:17:37.473,00:17:40.142,The party's squanchin' on at my place!
00:17:41.936,00:17:43.396,Cool! I'm comin' too!
00:17:43.521,00:17:46.482,Um... no. You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party.
00:17:46.607,00:17:48.901,-What? -Nancy told us what a bitch you are.
00:17:49.026,00:17:50.486,Guys? Seriously? Nancy?
00:17:50.611,00:17:52.572,"Summer, you're a bad person."
00:17:52.697,00:17:55.074,All you care about is having popular people like you.
00:17:55.199,00:18:03.040,"That's not what Abradolf Lincler stood for. Well, it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for."
00:18:06.294,00:18:10.256,"Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked."
00:18:10.381,00:18:11.966,You're so wise.
00:18:13.676,00:18:16.637,"-May I assist you with that? -Uh, sure, yeah, thanks."
00:18:16.762,00:18:20.016,"Morty, do you know what Wubba lubba dub dub means?"
00:18:20.141,00:18:24.103,-It's Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase. -It's not nonsense at all.
00:18:28.858,00:18:31.277,"Well, I got news for ya, he's saying it ironically."
00:18:31.402,00:18:35.364,"No, Morty. Your grandfather is indeed in very deep pain."
00:18:37.491,00:18:39.160,"-Come on, um... -Birdperson."
00:18:39.285,00:18:40.494,"Come on, Birdperson."
00:18:40.578,00:18:43.623,Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole.
00:18:43.748,00:18:48.210,Then why do you care if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures?
00:18:48.336,00:18:53.049,It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever.
00:18:53.132,00:18:54.967,You're right. I shouldn't even care.
00:18:57.345,00:18:59.138,I'm sick of having adventures with Rick.
00:18:59.221,00:19:02.391,My people have another saying: Gubba nub nub doo rah kah.
00:19:02.516,00:19:05.811,It means: Whatever lets you sleep at night.
00:19:06.812,00:19:09.607,"Guys, mom and dad are like, right around the corner."
00:19:09.732,00:19:12.526,"This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely."
00:19:12.652,00:19:13.986,Tammy!
00:19:23.371,00:19:25.331,"-Rick, wake up! -Wait? What--?"
00:19:25.456,00:19:28.959,"Rick, you gotta do something quick. My parents are home!"
00:19:29.085,00:19:31.504,Alright. Hold on.
00:19:33.464,00:19:35.841,"Oh, my God! They're walking up the driveway!"
00:19:35.966,00:19:37.843,-Bring me the thing. -What thing?
00:19:37.968,00:19:39.261,"The thing, the thing!"
00:19:39.345,00:19:42.223,It's got like buttons on it and lights and it beeps.
00:19:42.348,00:19:45.309,-That describes everything in your garage! -Do you mean this?
00:19:49.438,00:19:50.564,That should do it.
00:19:50.690,00:19:53.609,"-Whoa, what did you do? -See for yourself."
00:19:54.527,00:19:55.569,Wow!
00:19:55.695,00:19:59.907,"Yeah, everything's frozen in time. And Slow Mobius thinks he's all that."
00:20:00.032,00:20:01.575,-For how long? -I dunno.
00:20:01.701,00:20:04.328,How long do you guys want? A week? A month?
00:20:04.453,00:20:07.540,Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel?
00:20:31.147,00:20:32.523,-Worst movie ever. -Dumb.
00:20:35.568,00:20:37.778,"Get it? You know, cause it's frozen."
00:20:37.903,00:20:39.572,This has been so much fun.
00:20:39.697,00:20:45.244,"Hey, Rick, you know, this whole time I haven't once heard you say that Wubba lubba dub dub thing?"
00:20:48.205,00:20:51.834,"-Oh, yeah? What's that, Rick? -I love my grandkids."
00:21:02.678,00:21:04.346,Roll credits!
00:21:04.472,00:21:06.557,"Roll the credits, go!"
00:21:13.773,00:21:15.733,That's season one! Boom!
00:21:53.270,00:21:55.815,Revenge... What--?
00:22:07.368,00:22:09.954,"-Hey, bro! -I don't understand."
00:22:10.079,00:22:12.373,Are you enjoying this? Do you like this?
