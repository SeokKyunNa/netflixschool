00:00:45.712,00:00:48.173,Why did I ever agree to a balloon race?
00:00:48.256,00:00:50.592,Not too high! Not too fast!
00:00:55.764,00:00:57.098,"Oh, yes."
00:00:57.182,00:00:58.391,Ha. Hmm.
00:01:01.144,00:01:04.731,"And anyway, I can always keep my eyes closed."
00:01:04.814,00:01:08.068,"Don't forget, Mayor Goodway, I'll be in the balloon to help you."
00:01:08.151,00:01:10.445,"Oh, right. Thanks, Ryder."
00:01:10.528,00:01:12.822,"Okay. Ready to unroll, pups?"
00:01:12.906,00:01:13.740,Ready.
00:01:15.450,00:01:17.327,It sure is dusty.
00:01:17.410,00:01:25.752,"Uh-oh, it's got a… It's got a rip. A bad rip."
00:01:25.835,00:01:27.921,This balloon won't hold air.
00:01:28.004,00:01:33.551,"Oh, Mayor Humdinger from Foggy Bottom will win the annual Mayors' Balloon Race again."
00:01:33.635,00:01:36.805,Don't worry. We'll get this balloon ready in time for the race.
00:01:41.434,00:02:02.580,"On your bark, get set… New race to the Lookout."
00:02:08.878,00:02:11.506,"Pups, we've got a serious case of the wedgies."
00:02:13.508,00:02:14.634,Wait for me.
00:02:14.717,00:02:16.761,Whoa no. Ah!
00:02:34.279,00:02:36.322,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:02:36.406,00:02:38.283,"Pups, we have a problem."
00:02:39.659,00:02:43.580,We need to fix the hot air balloon for Mayor Goodway's big race.
00:02:43.663,00:02:45.456,The balloon has a big rip in it.
00:02:48.001,00:02:52.046,"Rocky, you'll need to find something we can reuse to patch it."
00:02:52.130,00:02:54.174,Green means go.
00:02:56.467,00:02:58.595,comes from a gas flame heater.
00:02:58.678,00:03:01.848,"Marshall, I'll need you to make sure that the heater is safe."
00:03:01.931,00:03:03.433,I'm fired up.
00:03:03.516,00:03:06.477,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:03:21.451,00:03:22.911,Whoa!
00:04:09.749,00:04:13.002,"No time to lose, pups. The balloon race starts soon."
00:04:13.086,00:04:15.421,Hmm. We need a patch.
00:04:16.422,00:04:18.800,I've got the perfect thing in my truck.
00:04:21.010,00:04:23.096,The big question is how they smell.
00:04:24.555,00:04:26.140,I don't smell any gas leaks.
00:04:30.937,00:04:31.854,Standing by.
00:04:41.406,00:04:45.618,This piece of Zuma's old surf kite will patch that hole up perfectly.
00:04:47.161,00:04:49.414,"Don't lose it, reuse it."
00:04:50.707,00:04:53.084,"The patch is perfect, Rocky."
00:05:04.262,00:05:06.222,Oh! It's working!
00:05:06.306,00:05:08.182,I can't believe it works!
00:05:08.266,00:05:11.019,"I-- Oh, I mean, of course it works."
00:05:11.102,00:05:13.146,The PAW Patrol fixed it.
00:05:14.689,00:05:17.150,The other balloons are getting near Farmer Yumi's.
00:05:17.233,00:05:19.402,"Once they get to the silo, the race starts."
00:05:19.485,00:05:20.611,We better hurry.
00:05:20.695,00:05:23.156,I'll grab our flying gear and we're off.
00:05:23.781,00:05:27.869,Time to get over my fear of heights once and for all.
00:05:29.329,00:05:35.960,I'm going to ride in this balloon and win this race!
00:05:38.087,00:05:39.380,"Oh, dear."
00:05:39.505,00:05:43.551,Is-- Is the ground going down or am I going up?
00:05:43.634,00:05:44.802,The balloon!
00:05:44.886,00:05:46.179,Grab it.
00:05:55.772,00:05:57.857,Uh-oh. Whoa!
00:05:57.940,00:05:59.192,Marshall!
00:06:02.445,00:06:03.279,Great catch.
00:06:04.447,00:06:07.450,"Ryder, pups!"
00:06:07.533,00:06:09.827,Get me down!
00:06:10.995,00:06:12.538,The race has started!
00:06:16.667,00:06:18.002,I don't see our balloon.
00:06:20.838,00:06:22.632,Mayor Goodway took off without me.
00:06:22.715,00:06:25.551,I need you to fly me to the balloon in your copter.
00:06:25.635,00:06:27.887,Let's take to the sky!
00:06:31.974,00:06:34.102,I can't look! I can't look!
00:06:34.185,00:06:37.021,But I must look.
00:06:38.022,00:06:41.025,Oh no! I better go higher.
00:06:43.152,00:06:45.071,Whoa!
00:06:50.076,00:06:51.828,"Well, aren't you a cutie."
00:06:58.751,00:07:02.880,Hmm. It looks like they got that dusty old bag of wind up in the air.
00:07:02.964,00:07:04.966,And the balloon is working too.
00:07:11.681,00:07:12.890,Let's go.
00:07:13.891,00:07:15.935,This pup's got to fly.
00:07:33.161,00:07:34.412,Ah!
00:07:41.210,00:07:42.170,Ryder?
00:07:42.253,00:07:43.963,Oh yes!
00:07:44.046,00:07:46.549,Oh no. I can't watch.
00:07:48.718,00:07:49.760,"Ready, Ryder?"
00:07:49.844,00:07:52.221,I'll swing you over to the balloon.
00:08:01.856,00:08:04.650,"Think you could give me a hand here, Mayor Goodway?"
00:08:06.694,00:08:09.030,Great. Now pull me in a bit.
00:08:09.864,00:08:10.698,Oh!
00:08:13.576,00:08:15.286,You did it. We did it.
00:08:15.369,00:08:16.204,Good work.
00:08:16.287,00:08:18.623,"Now, let's see about this race."
00:08:18.706,00:08:20.208,"Made it safe, Skye."
00:08:20.291,00:08:22.293,See you at the finish line.
00:08:22.376,00:08:23.294,Roger that.
00:08:23.377,00:08:25.213,Go win that trophy!
00:08:25.296,00:08:26.964,"Thank you, Ryder."
00:08:27.048,00:08:29.383,I'm so glad everything's okay now.
00:08:29.467,00:08:30.885,Not exactly.
00:08:37.391,00:08:41.312,"Close one. All right, Mayor, ready to win this race?"
00:08:43.689,00:08:46.108,-Are you in? -In it to win it!
00:08:54.075,00:08:57.495,Looks like another year on top for the town of Foggy Bottom.
00:08:59.038,00:09:00.248,What is it?
00:09:00.331,00:09:02.667,What? How did you get there?
00:09:02.750,00:09:05.461,"This race is on, Mayor Humdinger."
00:09:05.545,00:09:14.220,"Don't worry. We'll wait for you Oh, I've never lost a race, and I'm not starting now!"
00:09:14.303,00:09:15.596,After them!
00:09:17.807,00:09:19.183,There's Jinx Mountain.
00:09:19.267,00:09:21.394,The finish line is on the other side.
00:09:21.477,00:09:25.731,"The winds are stronger up higher, and we'd have a better chance of winning."
00:09:25.815,00:09:26.983,What do you say?
00:09:27.066,00:09:29.235,"Up, up, and away!"
00:09:29.735,00:09:30.903,Whoo-hoo!
00:09:46.627,00:09:48.379,Here they come!
00:09:48.462,00:09:50.172,"Go, Adventure Bay!"
00:09:53.634,00:09:55.886,"Oh, I have to prepare a victory speech."
00:09:55.970,00:09:57.680,I hope you get to use it.
00:09:59.807,00:10:01.434,How did Humdinger get ahead of us?
00:10:01.517,00:10:04.854,We're going to have to drop fast to get to the finish line first.
00:10:04.937,00:10:06.272,"Are you ready, Mayor?"
00:10:06.355,00:10:07.481,In it to win it!
00:10:07.565,00:10:09.692,Whoo-hoo!
00:10:23.539,00:10:25.916,"Oh, we did it!"
00:10:27.543,00:10:32.340,"I believe this trophy belongs to you this year, Mayor Goodway."
00:10:34.050,00:10:38.888,No. It belongs to Ryder and his loyal PAW Patrol.
00:10:38.971,00:10:41.432,This calls for a celebration.
00:10:54.987,00:10:56.197,"Thanks, Ryder."
00:10:56.280,00:10:58.908,You and the pups really saved the day.
00:10:58.991,00:11:01.535,"Whenever you need a hand, just yelp for help."
00:11:11.170,00:11:16.092,"Ryder, I've entered Adventure Bay into the Mayors' Submarine Race."
00:11:16.175,00:11:17.635,You can be my captain.
00:11:17.718,00:11:19.345,Ha! Why bother?
00:11:19.428,00:11:21.847,Foggy Bottom's sub is sure to win the Mayors' Race.
00:11:21.931,00:11:23.808,Just like last year.
00:11:23.891,00:11:26.018,I don't think so.
00:11:26.102,00:11:29.063,"Today is a new day, Humdinger."
00:11:32.108,00:11:34.110,"-Oh, you think so? -I know so."
00:11:34.193,00:11:36.028,"-We'll see about that. -Yes, we will."
00:00:59.017,00:01:01.186,"Hey, that sounds like Garbi."
00:01:15.992,00:01:19.204,"Thanks for helping me load up, pups. I'm really running behind."
00:01:29.756,00:01:32.550,Oops. Missed. I'll get it.
00:01:33.343,00:01:34.469,Huh?
00:01:35.220,00:01:36.930,Whoa!
00:01:41.226,00:01:44.646,"Uh, sorry about that, Mr. Porter."
00:01:44.729,00:01:45.897,"It's okay, Rubble."
00:02:00.245,00:02:03.790,"Mr. Porter, your truck is full. Where should I put these?"
00:02:03.873,00:02:06.376,Just on the passenger seat will do. Thanks.
00:02:18.096,00:02:19.931,That's a longer drop than I thought.
00:02:22.183,00:02:26.020,Whoa! Looks like I'm going to need some help getting you out of here.
00:02:27.647,00:02:29.482,Don't worry. I know who to call.
00:02:29.566,00:02:32.569,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:02:32.652,00:02:34.154,No ledge is too high!
00:02:36.030,00:02:38.241,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:02:43.663,00:02:45.165,"Thanks for your help, pups."
00:02:45.248,00:02:46.583,Take a treat to go!
00:02:50.753,00:02:53.631,"Mmm! Thanks for the treat, Mr. Porter!"
00:02:59.429,00:03:00.680,My biscuit!
00:03:00.763,00:03:02.223,"Marshall, look out!"
00:03:10.523,00:03:11.357,Got it.
00:03:28.708,00:03:30.960,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:03:34.547,00:03:36.674,"Thanks for coming so quickly, pups."
00:03:36.758,00:03:39.052,I need you to rescue me.
00:03:40.303,00:03:41.512,Rescue you?
00:03:44.641,00:03:45.850,We're-- Whoa!
00:03:49.354,00:03:51.272,Why is the picture spinning?
00:04:00.365,00:04:01.366,Uh-oh!
00:04:06.496,00:04:09.540,"Without my Pup Pad, the PAW Patrol won't know where to find us."
00:04:09.624,00:04:12.835,-How can we rescue Ryder… -Without Ryder?
00:04:12.919,00:04:15.463,We can do it! We're the PAW Patrol!
00:04:15.546,00:04:18.466,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:04:18.549,00:04:20.301,"First, we need to find him."
00:04:20.385,00:04:22.720,"-Rubble, maybe you could-- -I'll look at Jake's."
00:04:22.804,00:04:25.723,I'll use my helicopter and goggles to look from the air.
00:04:25.807,00:04:27.934,I could totally check the coast.
00:04:28.017,00:04:29.602,I'll check the parks and the field.
00:04:29.686,00:04:31.479,"-Hang on, pups. -Me too."
00:04:35.233,00:04:36.567,I have a plan!
00:04:40.321,00:04:45.994,We can track Ryder using the-- I know! Ryder's Pup Pad tracker will show where he is on the big map.
00:04:46.077,00:04:48.162,That's what I was trying to say.
00:04:51.499,00:04:53.626,It looks like Ryder's heading to Jake's Mountain.
00:04:53.710,00:04:56.796,"Come on, PAW Patrol. Let's save Ryder!"
00:04:57.880,00:05:03.219,"Rocky, you stay here and track the Pup Pad and let Skye know which way he's headed."
00:05:03.303,00:05:07.432,"And, Chase! I mean, me! I'll search from the ground."
00:05:08.891,00:05:10.435,"Great plan, Chase."
00:05:10.518,00:05:13.354,"Thanks, Rubble. But we all did it together."
00:05:59.025,00:06:01.319,"Hey, we don't have to wait for Ryder."
00:06:10.078,00:06:12.997,"Skye, it looks like Ryder's heading up to Jake's Mountain."
00:06:13.081,00:06:14.749,I'm on my way!
00:06:24.884,00:06:27.678,"Next stop, cream for Callie."
00:06:50.785,00:06:54.163,"Hey, can you make it back up this slope and get help?"
00:07:01.629,00:07:02.547,Look out!
00:07:20.648,00:07:22.942,"Wait, the melons aren't for Farmer Yumi!"
00:07:23.025,00:07:26.863,I got them from Farmer Yumi! Melons for the mayor!
00:07:30.908,00:07:33.786,I don't see Ryder heading to Farmer Yumi's.
00:07:33.870,00:07:36.914,He has turned around. U-turn! U-turn!
00:07:36.998,00:07:39.292,I'm on it! I think.
00:07:54.849,00:07:55.766,Hmm.
00:07:56.559,00:08:00.938,"Hey, maybe Ryder and Garbi are riding with Mr. Porter."
00:08:01.022,00:08:02.356,"Chase, check it out."
00:08:09.030,00:08:12.450,"Attention, Mr. Porter, please pull over."
00:08:12.533,00:08:14.160,This is an emergency.
00:08:19.207,00:08:21.792,What would Ryder and Garbi be doing in my van?
00:08:21.876,00:08:25.922,But-- But-- We tracked Ryder's Pup Pad right here.
00:08:32.220,00:08:34.305,Look! It's Ryder's Pup Pad.
00:08:34.388,00:08:36.474,"Well, how did that get in my van?"
00:08:36.557,00:08:38.184,Ryder must have dropped it.
00:08:38.267,00:08:40.144,That's why it went all spinny.
00:08:40.228,00:08:43.564,"And somehow, it ended up in this box of groceries."
00:08:43.648,00:08:47.610,"PAW Patrol, we've been tracking Ryder's Pup Pad, but not Ryder."
00:08:47.693,00:08:51.697,What? That means we still have no idea where Ryder and Garbi are.
00:08:54.367,00:08:58.663,Wait! We can go back and see where the Pup Pad was when Ryder called us.
00:08:59.747,00:09:00.706,Tool arm.
00:09:08.548,00:09:09.799,"Skye, Chase!"
00:09:09.882,00:09:12.385,Ryder was on Big View Trail when he called us.
00:09:14.595,00:09:18.182,"If this is where Ryder dropped his Pup Pad, he should be nearby."
00:09:23.312,00:09:27.233,"The ledge looks like it's gonna crumble. We need more help, fast."
00:09:39.078,00:09:42.832,"We have to get Marshall's ladder closer, but these boulders are blocking us."
00:09:43.416,00:09:44.667,Not for long.
00:09:53.134,00:09:54.885,"Great teamwork, pups!"
00:09:56.095,00:09:58.014,"Marshall, get your ladder in there."
00:09:58.097,00:09:59.056,I'm fired up!
00:10:07.940,00:10:11.402,My ladder's not long enough. How else can we get them?
00:10:12.862,00:10:14.614,"Ryder, get in the harness!"
00:10:14.697,00:10:17.074,"Thanks, Skye. Good plan!"
00:10:21.245,00:10:23.331,Don't worry. You're coming with me.
00:10:23.414,00:10:24.624,"Let's go, Garbi."
00:10:34.842,00:10:36.302,That was close.
00:10:52.652,00:10:54.779,I knew I could count on you pups!
00:11:00.618,00:11:01.952,Who wants a snack?
00:11:06.082,00:11:07.291,"Thanks, Mr. Porter."
00:11:14.965,00:11:17.176,"-Huh? -Garbi, dude."
00:11:17.259,00:11:20.388,"-Give that back! -Hey, Garbi!"
00:11:20.471,00:11:23.474,Don't worry. There's plenty of watermelon for everyone.
00:11:29.980,00:11:32.108,"Ah, it's okay, Ryder."
00:11:32.191,00:11:33.567,We have a spare.
00:11:33.651,00:11:36.654,"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!"
00:00:44.502,00:00:46.713,That eagle took our basket!
00:00:46.796,00:00:49.716,And candy and the eggs we decorated.
00:00:49.799,00:00:53.094,There goes our Easter egg hunt.
00:00:53.178,00:00:56.056,"Uh-oh, that eagle got Rocky too."
00:00:57.265,00:01:00.435,"Wow, we're really high. Cool!"
00:01:02.103,00:01:02.937,Whoa!
00:01:09.277,00:01:11.654,Chickaletta?! You came along for the ride.
00:01:13.615,00:01:17.869,I couldn't imagine this disaster getting any more… disastrous!
00:01:17.952,00:01:20.455,But does anyone see Chickaletta anywhere?
00:01:20.538,00:01:21.873,Chickaletta?
00:01:21.956,00:01:23.708,Chickaletta?
00:01:26.795,00:01:28.922,Chickaletta? Come on out.
00:01:29.506,00:01:31.841,"Olly, olly, chicken feed."
00:01:31.925,00:01:33.802,We can't find Chickaletta!
00:01:33.885,00:01:35.261,Call the PAW Patrol!
00:01:35.345,00:01:36.596,"Uh, Mayor Goodway?"
00:01:36.679,00:01:38.056,Right here.
00:01:39.057,00:01:41.392,"Oh! Yeah, of course."
00:01:42.852,00:01:46.731,We'll find that Easter basket and get Rocky and Chickaletta back safely.
00:01:46.815,00:01:49.484,And get the special egg I decorated.
00:01:51.653,00:01:52.987,That egg!
00:01:53.071,00:01:55.365,"Alex, where did you get that special egg?"
00:01:55.448,00:01:57.158,I found it hiking with Grandpa.
00:01:57.242,00:01:59.410,Do you think it could be an eagle's egg?
00:01:59.494,00:02:00.745,An eagle's egg?
00:02:00.829,00:02:03.873,Whoa! I just thought it was a super big chicken!
00:02:04.457,00:02:07.252,"I probably should've left it alone, huh?"
00:02:07.335,00:02:13.133,"Probably. When you find things like eggs out in nature, it's usually best to leave them alone."
00:02:15.093,00:02:17.679,"Ah, that's okay. We'll figure something out."
00:02:17.762,00:02:21.099,"Skye, can you catch up with that eagle and grab the basket?"
00:02:23.560,00:02:24.519,Wings!
00:02:27.897,00:02:29.941,Let's take to the sky!
00:02:35.697,00:02:39.450,"Look, Chickaletta. Skye's coming to rescue us."
00:02:40.368,00:02:42.287,Hang on! Here I come!
00:02:48.710,00:02:49.794,Huh?
00:03:07.187,00:03:08.605,I found Chickaletta.
00:03:08.688,00:03:10.398,She's with Rocky in the basket.
00:03:10.481,00:03:13.234,But I couldn't get them. The eagle chased me away.
00:03:13.318,00:03:15.820,You found my precious purse chicken.
00:03:17.363,00:03:21.868,"But a giant eagle has her! Ryder, how are we going to get her back?"
00:03:21.951,00:03:25.830,I think the eagle's taking the basket and her egg back to the nest.
00:03:26.414,00:03:29.375,"Alex, where exactly did you find that egg?"
00:03:29.459,00:03:31.461,Up past the rocks on the old fire road.
00:03:31.544,00:03:34.380,We need to get up there and find that eagle's nest fast.
00:03:34.464,00:03:36.633,"Marshall, I need you and your ladder."
00:03:36.716,00:03:39.010,"And, Chase, I need you and your police truck."
00:03:44.807,00:03:50.188,"Aw… What sweet, little, cute, teeny-weeny bunny-wunnies!"
00:03:55.777,00:04:01.115,"Rubble, I need your rig to clear the fire road as soon as we get these eggs out of here."
00:04:01.199,00:04:02.784,Rubble on the double!
00:04:02.867,00:04:05.119,PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:04:14.045,00:04:15.505,"It's okay, Chickaletta."
00:04:15.588,00:04:17.590,Ryder and the PAW Patrol will save us.
00:04:20.510,00:04:21.636,Wah!
00:04:25.348,00:04:27.642,This must be the eagle's nest.
00:04:27.725,00:04:29.185,She took us home.
00:04:29.269,00:04:31.145,"Now, we can climb down."
00:04:32.397,00:04:33.523,Or not.
00:04:36.651,00:04:43.241,"Okay. I'm just hanging out at this really, really, really high eagle's nest."
00:04:43.324,00:04:46.494,Who knew eagles loved Easter baskets so much?
00:04:46.577,00:04:50.498,That Easter egg Alex brought Mayor Goodway is an eagle's egg.
00:04:50.581,00:04:53.167,The eagle just rescued her baby.
00:04:53.251,00:04:55.670,Alex's egg is an eagle's egg?
00:04:55.753,00:04:59.090,Wow! That's why she flew us up here.
00:04:59.173,00:05:01.342,Hold tight. We're almost there!
00:05:03.344,00:05:04.887,Hello in there.
00:05:07.265,00:05:09.017,Ha! It's talking back.
00:05:25.700,00:05:29.078,"It's okay, little eggle. Your mom will be here soon."
00:05:37.503,00:05:39.630,There's no way around these rocks.
00:05:39.714,00:05:41.174,"Rubble, your turn."
00:05:49.098,00:05:51.017,But not as tough as me!
00:05:57.315,00:05:58.941,"-Great work, Rubble! -Whoo-hoo!"
00:05:59.025,00:06:00.234,Yes!
00:06:01.819,00:06:05.365,We should get this little eggle back in the nest where it belongs.
00:06:09.452,00:06:11.871,Careful. Careful.
00:06:19.003,00:06:20.213,Uh-oh.
00:06:22.048,00:06:24.092,Look! There's the eagle's nest!
00:06:24.175,00:06:25.510,And the basket!
00:06:27.095,00:06:30.056,That eagle doesn't look too happy with Rocky.
00:06:31.557,00:06:34.852,"I was just putting your egg back, really."
00:06:35.770,00:06:36.687,Huh?
00:06:37.230,00:06:39.982,"Uh, um… excuse me."
00:06:40.066,00:06:42.860,You have some worm hanging from your beak.
00:06:43.486,00:06:45.279,"Oh, for me?"
00:06:45.363,00:06:48.449,"Very sweet, but kinda yucky."
00:06:51.494,00:06:54.831,"There you go, and much better for you than all that candy."
00:06:56.624,00:06:58.209,"Ryder, pups!"
00:06:58.292,00:07:01.879,We can't get them with the eagle there. We have to distract her.
00:07:01.963,00:07:03.965,Food always distracts me.
00:07:04.048,00:07:05.550,"Great idea, Rubble!"
00:07:05.633,00:07:08.010,I bet she'd really go for some fish.
00:07:09.011,00:07:11.305,"Zuma, Skye, I need your help."
00:07:12.723,00:07:14.892,This pup's gotta fly!
00:07:17.061,00:07:18.479,Let's dive in!
00:07:24.902,00:07:27.447,"Cap'n Turbot, we need a bucket of fish."
00:07:27.530,00:07:29.907,"Sure, Zuma, coming right up."
00:07:29.991,00:07:31.409,One bucket of fish.
00:07:34.954,00:07:36.372,There you go!
00:07:39.167,00:07:41.419,Thanks for saving the big Easter hunt.
00:07:42.462,00:07:44.589,Kids today look for Easter fish?
00:07:44.672,00:07:46.632,Whatever happened to jelly beans?
00:07:46.716,00:07:49.093,"Skye, I've got the fish!"
00:07:50.720,00:07:52.722,Roger that. I'm coming in.
00:07:57.310,00:07:58.561,I got it!
00:08:04.275,00:08:06.110,She doesn't even blink.
00:08:26.631,00:08:30.259,"Let's hustle, pups. I'm guessing Mama Eagle's a fast eater."
00:08:32.136,00:08:32.970,Ladder!
00:08:37.058,00:08:40.228,"-Yay! -I'm on my way, Rocky."
00:08:43.397,00:08:45.274,Wait! I'm not ready! Whoa!
00:08:45.358,00:08:47.068,Ooh! Ooh! Ow! Oh!
00:08:48.069,00:08:49.695,Chickaletta's down.
00:08:49.779,00:08:51.656,A little quicker than I planned.
00:08:51.739,00:08:55.618,"Careful, careful… Okay."
00:08:55.701,00:08:57.954,"You're home, little eggle. Mom's on her way."
00:08:59.413,00:09:00.581,You're welcome.
00:09:03.626,00:09:04.585,"Chase, net!"
00:09:09.882,00:09:12.260,Whoa! Yeah!
00:09:12.343,00:09:14.554,"Yes! Nice save, Chase."
00:09:16.973,00:09:20.726,Let's get out of here before that eagle thinks that we're fish.
00:09:20.810,00:09:22.353,What about the basket?
00:09:24.605,00:09:26.857,"Skye, you know what to do."
00:09:26.941,00:09:28.150,I'm on it.
00:09:32.989,00:09:35.116,-Yes! -We've got them!
00:09:36.576,00:09:39.245,"Rocky, you look way okay, dude."
00:09:40.788,00:09:42.957,"Chickaletta, you're back!"
00:09:45.835,00:09:48.337,"Oh, did my chicky-boo-boo have a big adventure?"
00:09:48.421,00:09:50.965,"Oh, and all the eggs are back!"
00:09:51.048,00:09:52.258,Not all.
00:09:52.341,00:09:57.263,"Alex, your eagle's egg is exactly where it belongs, with its mommy."
00:09:58.681,00:10:00.641,"Oh, too, too cute."
00:10:00.725,00:10:03.769,"Now, that's the best Easter parade ever."
00:10:03.853,00:10:07.398,And you're all back in time to help finish coloring the eggs!
00:10:10.610,00:10:12.278,That's a lot of eggs.
00:10:12.361,00:10:14.280,Let's dive in!
00:10:16.490,00:10:19.452,"Hurry up, pups! It's about to start."
00:10:23.914,00:10:26.167,"Happy Easter, everyone!"
00:10:26.250,00:10:34.133,"Welcome to the biggest, most beautiful, brilliantly bodacious Easter egg hunt Adventure Bay has ever seen!"
00:10:36.969,00:10:38.179,"Now, go find some eggs!"
00:10:41.182,00:10:42.600,-Wow! -I got it! I got it!
00:10:44.602,00:10:47.772,"Ryder, you put the awesome back into the Easter egg hunt."
00:10:47.855,00:10:49.690,I can't thank you enough.
00:10:49.774,00:10:51.609,"No worries, Mayor Goodway."
00:10:51.692,00:10:54.362,"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help."
00:10:55.696,00:10:56.739,Found one.
00:10:57.490,00:10:58.866,Whoa!
00:11:12.630,00:11:15.841,"Chase, egg alert! Bumblebee, go, go, go!"
00:11:36.779,00:11:38.322,Marshall wins!
00:11:42.743,00:11:45.204,What amazing colored eggs.
00:11:45.287,00:11:48.499,"Hey, I wonder how that little eggle is doing."
00:11:48.582,00:11:49.792,Let's find out.
00:11:52.336,00:11:54.213,"Pups, check this out."
00:00:52.552,00:00:55.305,These old tennis balls make great Christmas decorations.
00:00:55.388,00:00:58.266,"Yup. Don't lose it, reuse it."
00:00:58.349,00:00:59.559,"Go for it, Chase."
00:01:02.896,00:01:04.230,Perfect shot!
00:01:06.900,00:01:09.235,Can't wait for Santa to get here!
00:01:09.319,00:01:10.945,He'll be here soon.
00:01:12.906,00:01:14.282,I've got the popcorn.
00:01:14.365,00:01:15.700,Ooh!
00:01:16.743,00:01:19.662,Christmas Eve popcorn snack? Yum!
00:01:19.746,00:01:21.623,This isn't for eating.
00:01:21.706,00:01:23.541,It's for hanging on the tree.
00:01:23.625,00:01:29.005,"Okay, my eyes will like popcorn on the tree, but my tummy would rather eat it."
00:01:29.089,00:01:32.342,"Using a real live Christmas tree is a great idea, Rocky."
00:01:32.425,00:01:34.803,But it's so tall!
00:01:34.886,00:01:36.679,Did we make enough decorations?
00:01:36.763,00:01:38.098,"Don't worry, Marshall."
00:01:38.181,00:01:40.850,I've got some Christmas lights in my pup house.
00:01:40.934,00:01:41.976,I'll get them.
00:01:47.857,00:01:49.859,"Well, that's as far as I can reach."
00:01:49.943,00:01:52.320,How will we hang anything on those high branches?
00:01:52.403,00:01:53.530,I'm on it.
00:02:02.163,00:02:03.414,With my ladder.
00:02:10.130,00:02:11.172,Here's some lights.
00:02:11.256,00:02:12.215,Let's decorate.
00:02:12.298,00:02:13.591,-Yeah! -Yeah!
00:02:43.621,00:02:46.416,The ornaments we made look great on the tree.
00:02:47.500,00:02:50.086,"Hmm, something's missing."
00:02:50.170,00:02:51.963,-What? -The star.
00:02:52.046,00:02:53.798,We need to put the star on top!
00:02:59.220,00:03:01.181,This pup's gotta fly!
00:03:08.104,00:03:09.856,"Way to go, Skye!"
00:03:09.939,00:03:11.065,"That's it, Skye."
00:03:12.650,00:03:15.570,"There, now we know Santa will find us."
00:03:15.653,00:03:17.864,And bring lots of presents.
00:03:17.947,00:03:21.326,Yeah! This'll be the best Christmas ever!
00:03:32.420,00:03:33.338,Can you see him?
00:03:33.421,00:03:35.340,Yeah! Can you? Can you?
00:03:35.423,00:03:38.051,Hmm… There's Santa right there.
00:03:38.134,00:03:41.095,They're tracking him on radar as he flies around the world.
00:03:41.179,00:03:43.473,Uh-oh. Look at those clouds.
00:03:49.854,00:03:51.981,And it's heading right towards us.
00:03:52.065,00:03:54.192,Look! There's Adventure Bay!
00:03:54.275,00:03:55.902,What's Santa going to do?
00:03:55.985,00:04:00.198,"Don't worry. If anyone can fly through a bad winter storm, it's Santa."
00:04:00.281,00:04:03.326,Did you put out the sugar cookies and the carrots for the reindeer?
00:04:03.409,00:04:07.664,"Yeah, but… I kind of tasted the cookies."
00:04:07.747,00:04:10.667,And I kind of helped him taste them.
00:04:14.045,00:04:16.339,So we're getting more.
00:04:16.422,00:04:20.218,Okay. Then let's all get to sleep so Santa can come.
00:04:33.231,00:04:34.774,"Okay, pups, bedtime."
00:04:34.857,00:04:37.110,You should all be asleep before Santa gets here.
00:04:37.193,00:04:39.195,But we want to stay up and see Santa.
00:04:39.279,00:04:43.283,"Yeah, I'm going to stay up all night so I can meet Santa."
00:04:43.366,00:04:44.826,"Yeah, me too!"
00:04:44.909,00:04:47.120,But I don't think you can stay up and see Santa.
00:04:47.203,00:04:50.873,"I try every Christmas, and I always fall asleep before he comes."
00:04:50.957,00:04:52.000,We can do it.
00:04:52.083,00:04:54.585,"Yeah! We'll all do it, together!"
00:04:58.840,00:05:02.135,"Come on, Zuma. We have to stay awake to meet Santa."
00:05:16.065,00:05:17.984,"Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho."
00:05:18.067,00:05:19.485,Whoa!
00:05:22.030,00:05:24.949,"Ho, ho-- No! Not the presents!"
00:05:27.744,00:05:29.579,"Ho, ho-- Whoa!"
00:05:29.662,00:05:31.247,More presents!
00:05:37.170,00:05:39.297,Oh no! The Christmas Star!
00:05:43.426,00:05:45.928,"Whoa, Cupid! Watch out!"
00:05:47.930,00:05:49.807,Come back!
00:05:54.937,00:05:56.272,"Ho, ho, ho."
00:05:57.774,00:05:59.942,-Oh no! -Wait. What happened to Santa?
00:06:00.985,00:06:02.362,Who could that be?
00:06:02.445,00:06:03.363,Hello?
00:06:03.446,00:06:06.032,"Ho, ho, ho! Hello, Ryder."
00:06:06.115,00:06:07.200,It's Santa.
00:06:07.283,00:06:11.662,Santa? Santa Claus? Calling me?
00:06:11.746,00:06:16.292,I seem to have run into a big storm and a wee bit of trouble.
00:06:16.376,00:06:21.881,"My sleigh crashed, I dumped a load of gifts, and my reindeer are lost."
00:06:21.964,00:06:25.635,"Worst of all, I lost the magic Christmas Star."
00:06:25.718,00:06:27.720,The magic Christmas Star?
00:06:27.804,00:06:32.266,The star has the magic that makes the sleigh and reindeer fly.
00:06:32.350,00:06:34.602,"Without it, I'll never finish delivering my gifts."
00:06:34.685,00:06:36.562,Christmas will be ruined.
00:06:37.563,00:06:41.734,I need you and the PAW Patrol to help save Christmas.
00:06:41.818,00:06:44.570,Save Christmas? Us?
00:06:46.781,00:06:50.868,"there was no job too big, no pup too small."
00:06:50.952,00:06:52.078,"You're right, Santa!"
00:06:52.161,00:06:54.997,The pups and I will do anything we can to save Christmas!
00:06:55.081,00:06:56.666,We'll be right there!
00:07:04.882,00:07:06.968,PAW Patrol to the Lookout!
00:07:39.584,00:07:41.294,"…duty, Ryder, sir."
00:07:41.794,00:07:44.755,An emergency tonight? On Christmas Eve?
00:07:44.839,00:07:47.758,It would be too sad to have the best day of the year ruined.
00:07:47.842,00:07:50.470,"This might ruin more than our Christmas, Marshall."
00:07:50.553,00:07:52.555,It might ruin everyone's Christmas.
00:07:54.474,00:07:56.934,Santa's sleigh got caught in the blizzard and crashed.
00:08:02.440,00:08:03.941,All the presents?
00:08:04.025,00:08:05.401,That's really bad.
00:08:05.485,00:08:08.654,"Even worse, the sleigh lost it's magic Christmas Star."
00:08:09.947,00:08:17.580,"Without it, the reindeer don't have the Christmas magic they need to fly and Santa can't deliver his gifts to all the girls and boys and pups!"
00:08:17.663,00:08:19.207,Where is Santa?
00:08:19.290,00:08:23.628,"He's looking for the star, but he asked the PAW Patrol if we can help save Christmas."
00:08:27.548,00:08:30.968,"Rubble, I need you and your shovel to dig the sleigh out the snow."
00:08:31.052,00:08:33.304,Rubble on the double!
00:08:34.931,00:08:40.353,"Rocky, I need your forklift to help lift Santa's sleigh and some recycled parts to fix it."
00:08:40.436,00:08:42.772,"Don't lose it, reuse it!"
00:08:44.565,00:08:51.906,"Skye, Zuma, and Marshall, I need you to use your helicopter, hovercraft, and fire truck to deliver the presents around Adventure Bay."
00:08:54.575,00:08:56.702,This pup's gotta fly!
00:08:56.786,00:08:58.496,Let's dive in!
00:08:58.579,00:08:59.789,I'm fired up!
00:09:01.374,00:09:05.044,"Chase, I need your megaphone and net to help round up Santa's reindeer."
00:09:05.127,00:09:07.880,Chase is on the case!
00:09:07.964,00:09:10.925,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:09:25.898,00:09:27.358,Whoa!
00:00:49.507,00:00:52.510,Almost done unloading Mr. Porter's fruits.
00:00:52.594,00:00:55.221,Then it's time for Mr. Porter's treats!
00:00:55.305,00:00:57.932,"Mmm, my favorite time of day."
00:00:59.392,00:01:01.061,I wonder what he's making?
00:01:01.144,00:01:06.483,"Something smells like… Uh-oh, rotten bananas?"
00:01:08.276,00:01:10.612,These will make great compost.
00:01:10.695,00:01:13.531,"When you're done, it goes in the bin."
00:01:17.869,00:01:20.080,One more crate and we're done.
00:01:23.625,00:01:34.928,"Meatballs for two hardworking-- Good catch, Mr. Porter."
00:01:39.849,00:01:41.101,"Nice one, Chase."
00:01:47.023,00:01:48.650,"Hey, Ryder, it's Jake."
00:01:48.733,00:01:50.235,"Hey, Jake. What's up?"
00:01:53.071,00:01:53.947,Huh?
00:01:54.030,00:01:55.698,The chairlift broke.
00:01:55.782,00:01:58.034,We got everybody off but Katie and Cali.
00:01:58.118,00:02:01.371,Check it out. They are seriously stuck.
00:02:03.331,00:02:04.958,Cali doesn't look happy.
00:02:05.041,00:02:08.711,"Dude, she is so the opposite of happy."
00:02:11.965,00:02:14.217,But Cali is really getting cold up here.
00:02:15.426,00:02:16.845,We'll be right there.
00:02:16.928,00:02:20.473,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:02:22.976,00:02:24.727,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:02:26.604,00:02:28.064,"Come on, Rubble!"
00:02:30.233,00:02:31.734,Don't forget your doggy bag!
00:02:31.818,00:02:34.404,Six meatballs to go!
00:02:34.487,00:02:35.655,One for each pup.
00:02:35.738,00:02:37.532,"Thanks, Mr. Porter."
00:02:39.075,00:02:40.785,"You're welcome, pups!"
00:02:42.829,00:02:44.455,Whoa!
00:02:45.999,00:02:48.835,Orange you glad it wasn't a banana peel?
00:02:54.132,00:02:55.508,Whoa!
00:02:55.592,00:02:57.427,Our meatballs!
00:03:07.562,00:03:10.565,Mmm. Most delicious wipe-out I ever had.
00:03:28.166,00:03:30.084,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:03:30.168,00:03:32.879,"Okay, pups, we have an emergency."
00:03:35.256,00:03:38.259,Katie and Cali are stuck high up on a chairlift.
00:03:38.343,00:03:39.802,And it's getting cold.
00:03:40.303,00:03:48.311,"We have to get them down, then fix the chairlift so people can keep having fun snowboarding.3 I could have fun snowboarding."
00:03:50.021,00:03:52.148,Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!
00:03:55.526,00:03:59.322,We need you and your ladder to help Katie and Cali get down.
00:03:59.405,00:04:02.742,Ready for a ruff-ruff rescue!
00:04:07.956,00:04:11.584,I'll need you and your tools from your Pup Pack to help fix the chairlift.
00:04:11.668,00:04:13.670,Green means go!
00:04:15.004,00:04:18.007,Of all the days not to need a construction pup.
00:04:18.091,00:04:21.052,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:05:35.918,00:05:37.128,"This way, pups."
00:05:44.844,00:05:45.845,I'm okay.
00:05:49.057,00:05:51.768,"Marshall, can you get down there with your truck?"
00:05:51.851,00:05:53.394,"I don't think so, Ryder."
00:05:53.478,00:05:56.564,It's too far down and too steep.
00:05:56.647,00:05:57.565,Sorry.
00:05:57.648,00:05:58.733,Hmm.
00:06:01.486,00:06:04.572,I'm sure I could have helped up on the mountain.
00:06:07.075,00:06:08.618,while you were there?
00:06:08.701,00:06:15.792,"Well, if I was all the way up there… I need one more of you for the rescue."
00:06:20.171,00:06:22.465,-A helicopter would be more-- -Huh?
00:06:22.548,00:06:24.717,"What?! I mean, yes!"
00:06:24.801,00:06:26.302,"I mean, anything to help!"
00:06:26.386,00:06:28.596,"I'll need you and your digger here, fast."
00:06:28.679,00:06:30.348,Double on the Rubble!
00:06:34.185,00:06:37.438,I'm going to Jake's mountain! Yes!
00:06:48.741,00:06:50.827,Uh-oh. There's your problem.
00:06:51.327,00:06:53.538,The cable support wheel is broken.
00:06:53.621,00:06:56.040,"Oh, good eye, Rocky dude."
00:06:56.124,00:06:59.794,But we can't fix it until we get Katie and Cali off the chair.
00:06:59.877,00:07:06.300,"Once we get them down, Rocky, you can fix the wheel and use your pincers in your Pup Pack to get the cable back into place."
00:07:10.054,00:07:10.888,I'm on it.
00:07:10.972,00:07:14.350,"Great. Hang on, Katie. We'll get you down."
00:07:14.434,00:07:15.351,"Thanks, Ryder."
00:07:17.186,00:07:19.313,"No, Cali. We're still stuck up here."
00:07:19.397,00:07:20.481,But we'll be okay.
00:07:25.236,00:07:29.240,"Rubble, come on. I'll show you where Katie and Cali are stuck."
00:07:32.034,00:07:33.870,They're right down there.
00:07:33.953,00:07:35.329,Whoa!
00:07:35.413,00:07:36.581,Awesome!
00:07:36.664,00:07:40.418,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
00:07:41.252,00:07:43.004,Whoa!
00:07:43.504,00:07:44.547,Whoa!
00:07:45.923,00:07:47.258,Whoa!
00:07:49.010,00:07:50.178,Whoa!
00:07:50.261,00:07:51.387,Marshall!
00:07:53.306,00:07:56.434,I'm good-- Whoa!
00:07:56.517,00:07:59.353,That's one way to get down the hill.
00:08:02.440,00:08:05.359,Whoa!
00:08:10.781,00:08:12.158,"Are you okay, Marshall?"
00:08:12.241,00:08:16.162,I'm fine. Just… helping you guys get down.
00:08:16.245,00:08:19.373,"That's good, because it's cold and I'm starting to shiver."
00:08:19.457,00:08:24.003,Don't worry. We'll get you out of that chair as soon as I get out of this snow.
00:08:25.922,00:08:26.923,"You okay, buddy?"
00:08:27.006,00:08:31.844,Yeah. But my tail's a little ch-- chilly.
00:08:37.183,00:08:39.352,"Hey, Ryder, what's the plan?"
00:08:43.648,00:08:45.858,Huh? Stairs?
00:08:45.942,00:08:48.528,We can make a giant snow staircase.
00:09:01.207,00:09:03.292,This will work great!
00:09:07.588,00:09:08.881,That should do it.
00:09:08.965,00:09:11.926,"Yay, Ryder! Cali is getting pretty cold."
00:09:14.470,00:09:17.056,"-I'll give you a hand. -Oh, thanks, Ryder."
00:09:24.230,00:09:26.440,"Cali, whoa! What are you doing?"
00:09:29.944,00:09:31.279,-Cali! -Marshall!
00:09:32.905,00:09:34.156,Uh-oh.
00:09:42.248,00:09:44.417,Whoa!
00:09:47.128,00:09:49.255,Cali! Are you okay?
00:09:54.510,00:09:57.138,I'm just not much of a snow pup.
00:10:07.565,00:10:10.735,"It would have been a long, cold night stuck on that chairlift."
00:10:10.818,00:10:13.654,"We're glad you yelped for help. Right, pups?"
00:10:15.740,00:10:19.160,I am. Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten to snowboard.
00:10:19.744,00:10:21.746,"How's it going up there, Rocky?"
00:10:26.792,00:10:29.170,"Rocky, you rocked it, dude!"
00:10:29.253,00:10:31.589,Who wants to make sure the chairlift is working okay?
00:10:31.672,00:10:32.882,"Me, me, me!"
00:10:35.259,00:10:39.889,"All right, you all deserve to hit the slopes 'cause you're such good pups."
00:10:51.025,00:10:52.443,Whoo-hoo!
00:11:13.005,00:11:14.090,Yeah!
00:11:21.847,00:11:23.599,All right!
00:00:48.798,00:00:50.091,"Is it working, Ryder?"
00:00:50.175,00:00:53.303,I think so. Let me try the remote.
00:00:53.887,00:00:55.930,"Okay, Robo Dog, walk."
00:00:59.642,00:01:02.312,Yes! Robo Dog is working!
00:01:02.395,00:01:03.980,Let's see… Sit.
00:01:06.733,00:01:08.985,Robo Dog takes commands perfectly!
00:01:10.028,00:01:12.113,"Hey, cool robot, Ryder."
00:01:12.197,00:01:14.657,"Thanks, Skye. I just finished him."
00:01:14.741,00:01:16.534,Let's try… digging.
00:01:18.411,00:01:19.329,Huh?
00:01:20.205,00:01:21.331,Whoa!
00:01:23.666,00:01:25.126,Where'd he go?
00:01:30.590,00:01:31.424,Huh?
00:01:31.508,00:01:33.093,Whoa! Where did you come from?
00:01:34.886,00:01:36.179,I see you've met Robo Dog.
00:01:36.262,00:01:38.348,"Yeah, he totally woke me up."
00:01:38.431,00:01:41.684,Let's try… flying Robo Dog!
00:01:42.894,00:01:44.354,-Wow. -Nice.
00:01:48.608,00:01:51.277,-Whoo-hoo! -All right!
00:01:53.488,00:01:56.199,"-Wow, it sure can fly. -Huh?"
00:01:56.282,00:01:59.452,-What else can it do? -It should run super fast.
00:01:59.536,00:02:02.539,"Aw, no robot can outrun me."
00:02:02.622,00:02:05.166,That totally sounds like a challenge.
00:02:05.250,00:02:07.627,"A challenge, huh? I'll do it."
00:02:07.710,00:02:08.920,I'll race the robot.
00:02:09.003,00:02:10.296,I'll start it.
00:02:13.675,00:02:15.718,Runners to the starting line.
00:02:17.178,00:02:31.401,"On your bark, get set… Whoa! Whoa!"
00:02:39.159,00:02:40.410,"Way to go, Marshall!"
00:02:40.493,00:02:42.245,Whoa!
00:02:44.414,00:02:45.707,I'm stuck.
00:02:47.500,00:02:48.793,Whoa!
00:02:52.255,00:02:53.464,Huh?
00:02:56.801,00:02:58.261,You won't beat me!
00:02:58.928,00:03:00.221,Whoa!
00:03:02.932,00:03:07.854,-Ow! Ooh! Whoa! -Oh!
00:03:34.839,00:03:36.341,Where did it go?
00:03:36.424,00:03:37.467,I don't know.
00:03:37.550,00:03:39.969,That broken antenna means I can't control it.
00:03:41.221,00:03:42.388,Robo Pup?
00:03:45.433,00:03:48.228,One Porter Burger with onions.
00:03:50.563,00:03:51.773,-Huh? -What was that?
00:03:54.067,00:03:55.026,Huh?
00:04:07.205,00:04:08.665,What the-- Whoa!
00:04:09.249,00:04:10.625,Huh? Yow!
00:04:15.838,00:04:20.093,"Ryder, help. Someone's peculiar pet pooch has gone positively punchy!"
00:04:20.176,00:04:23.680,"Uh, is that pooch kind of metallic looking?"
00:04:23.763,00:04:26.766,Now that you mention it… That's my Robo Dog.
00:04:26.849,00:04:29.102,It's kind of a little out of control.
00:04:29.185,00:04:32.730,A little out of control? You have to stop that robot.
00:04:32.814,00:04:35.984,"Don't worry, Mayor Goodway. We'll take care of Robo Dog."
00:04:36.067,00:04:39.070,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:04:42.115,00:04:44.784,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:04:46.536,00:04:47.954,"Watch your step, Rocky."
00:04:48.037,00:04:49.872,You don't want to fall in a-- Whoa!
00:04:50.581,00:04:51.457,Hole?
00:04:53.459,00:04:54.836,Look out!
00:04:58.089,00:05:00.508,And that is how we roll.
00:05:17.650,00:05:19.610,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:05:20.987,00:05:22.739,Thanks for getting here so quickly.
00:05:22.822,00:05:24.824,We all saw what happened to Robo Dog.
00:05:24.907,00:05:27.410,It's broken and now it's going haywire all over town.
00:05:27.493,00:05:30.455,We have to stop it before it causes any more problems.
00:05:30.538,00:05:31.998,-Uh-oh… -It can really make a mess.
00:05:32.081,00:05:38.379,-That's really bad. -Robo Dog's already been spotted and has made a big mess at Mr. Porter's restaurant and City Hall.
00:05:39.172,00:05:42.050,"When we catch it, there's an off switch on its pup tag."
00:05:42.133,00:05:45.136,"If we turn Robo Dog off, I can try to fix it."
00:05:46.220,00:05:51.100,"Skye, with your helicopter and goggles, you should be able to locate it in no time."
00:05:56.147,00:05:59.859,"Rocky, I need you to help us build something so we can catch it."
00:05:59.942,00:06:01.986,Green means go!
00:06:02.070,00:06:06.491,"The rest of you pups, please help clean up the mess Robo Dog is making around town."
00:06:06.574,00:06:09.369,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:07:24.068,00:07:25.486,It went that-a-way!
00:07:26.487,00:07:29.073,No sign of Robo Dog at City Hall.
00:07:29.157,00:07:30.324,I'll keep looking.
00:07:30.408,00:07:31.576,"Thanks, Skye."
00:07:40.793,00:07:44.088,"Come on, Cali, just a little bath and you'll be all clean."
00:07:55.349,00:07:56.309,Huh?
00:08:00.062,00:08:02.523,Guess he didn't want to use the doggy door.
00:08:07.862,00:08:09.989,There goes Robo Dog!
00:08:14.702,00:08:18.122,"Here comes Rubble, on the double!"
00:08:21.459,00:08:23.961,"Here's the last of the watermelons, Mr. Porter."
00:08:24.545,00:08:26.547,"Thanks for helping clean up, pups."
00:08:26.631,00:08:28.090,I think we got all of it.
00:08:29.425,00:08:30.343,Whoa!
00:08:33.095,00:08:35.348,"Hey, guys, have you seen Robo Dog?"
00:08:35.431,00:08:37.475,You could say that.
00:08:43.564,00:08:45.650,Is that what I think it is?
00:08:47.360,00:08:50.655,"Ryder, your robot is out here, heading for me!"
00:08:50.738,00:08:53.074,Can you get him to fly towards Rocky's truck?
00:08:53.157,00:08:54.492,I'll do my best.
00:08:54.575,00:08:56.494,This pup's gotta fly!
00:08:57.703,00:08:58.788,Whoa!
00:09:02.041,00:09:03.209,"Ready, Rocky?"
00:09:03.292,00:09:04.293,Almost.
00:09:04.961,00:09:10.299,"If we can launch this magnet close enough to Robo Pup, it'll stick to his metal body."
00:09:10.383,00:09:13.636,And Skye can hook the magnet and bring Robo Dog down here.
00:09:13.719,00:09:19.642,"Any second now… -Right on time! Ready, Rocky? -Ready."
00:09:21.602,00:09:22.770,And… now!
00:09:28.025,00:09:29.485,"Perfect shot, Rocky!"
00:09:32.196,00:09:33.614,"You got it, Ryder!"
00:09:42.915,00:09:44.375,"Ooh, close!"
00:09:46.752,00:09:48.879,Coming in for a second try!
00:09:50.381,00:09:51.424,Got it!
00:09:53.426,00:09:54.594,"Hang on, Ryder."
00:10:06.439,00:10:10.818,"Sorry, buddy. Turning off Robo Dog… now."
00:10:18.159,00:10:20.077,Robo Dog sure was great.
00:10:25.374,00:10:27.710,I have an old antenna for you. I think it'll work.
00:10:27.793,00:10:29.003,"Good idea, Rocky!"
00:10:40.723,00:10:42.141,"It works, Ryder!"
00:10:43.476,00:10:46.395,"Thanks, Rocky, and thanks to all you pups too."
00:10:46.479,00:10:49.774,I couldn't have fixed it or even caught Robo Dog without you.
00:10:49.857,00:10:55.237,"Well, you know, Ryder, if you're ever in trouble… Just yelp for help."
00:10:57.156,00:10:59.033,What a bunch of good pups.
00:10:59.116,00:11:01.369,"So, who wants to play with Robo Dog?"
00:11:22.306,00:11:24.350,Hooray! Whoo-hoo!
00:11:25.351,00:11:27.395,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:11:34.610,00:11:36.445,Now that's a happy pup.
00:00:47.505,00:00:51.426,"And headed for the finish line, Skye's ahead by a nose."
00:00:53.595,00:00:55.346,"Oh, he's passing me."
00:00:58.600,00:01:00.643,Training is tiring.
00:01:03.897,00:01:06.900,"On your mark, get set, run!"
00:01:13.656,00:01:14.824,Whoa!
00:01:14.908,00:01:15.742,Ow!
00:01:23.416,00:01:26.336,Marshall is in the lead as they reach the target area.
00:01:26.419,00:01:27.462,Whoa! Ow!
00:01:32.217,00:01:33.468,Marshall!
00:01:35.887,00:01:37.388,Whoa!
00:01:40.558,00:01:42.310,"Sorry about that, Rocky."
00:01:42.393,00:01:43.686,It's okay.
00:01:44.395,00:01:47.857,I wouldn't mind the water so much if it wasn't so wet.
00:01:54.322,00:01:56.324,Alex? What do you got there?
00:01:56.407,00:01:59.994,"Hey, Grandpa, check out what I made from old restaurant stuff."
00:02:00.078,00:02:01.496,A super trike.
00:02:01.579,00:02:04.207,Look. Pizza paddle brakes.
00:02:04.290,00:02:07.877,Nice. And you used lots of duct tape.
00:02:07.961,00:02:10.088,Just like you taught me. Watch.
00:02:13.383,00:02:14.551,Whoo-hoo!
00:02:15.969,00:02:18.263,My super trike!
00:02:18.847,00:02:21.349,Now I have to put it all back together again.
00:02:23.017,00:02:24.644,The parts are all over the street.
00:02:24.727,00:02:27.272,You can't go out looking for them in all this traffic.
00:02:28.606,00:02:31.985,Aw. My super trike is ruined.
00:02:32.527,00:02:34.529,I know who can help.
00:02:48.334,00:02:51.254,"Hi, Ryder. I have a bit of an emergency."
00:02:51.337,00:02:56.176,"Alex put together a super trike, but it kind of fell apart and ended up all over the street."
00:02:56.259,00:02:59.512,It didn't turn out as super as he hoped?
00:02:59.596,00:03:00.847,He could use some help.
00:03:00.930,00:03:03.391,I know you're pretty handy with gadgets and vehicles.
00:03:03.474,00:03:04.976,Tell him we're on our way.
00:03:05.059,00:03:07.937,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:03:25.330,00:03:27.123,"Marshall, your hose!"
00:03:31.211,00:03:35.465,"Oops. That was the spray bark, not the hose-away bark."
00:03:56.694,00:03:59.489,"Today, we have a different kind of emergency."
00:03:59.572,00:04:04.786,Our friend Alex has worked extra hard building a super trike out of old restaurant stuff.
00:04:04.869,00:04:07.497,"Wow, it's all recycled."
00:04:08.790,00:04:10.583,But it fell apart on him.
00:04:10.667,00:04:13.836,We can help him put it back together a little better.
00:04:16.005,00:04:22.470,"Rocky, I need you and your recycling bin We have to collect Alex's trike parts and put them back together."
00:04:22.553,00:04:24.472,And maybe add a few of our own.
00:04:24.555,00:04:27.016,"Don't lose it, reuse it."
00:04:32.188,00:04:35.358,so we can safely find the parts of Alex's trike.
00:04:35.942,00:04:37.860,Chase is on the case.
00:04:37.944,00:04:40.905,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll.
00:05:53.936,00:05:55.521,Let's secure the work zone.
00:06:06.574,00:06:08.117,PAW Patrol at work.
00:06:10.453,00:06:12.705,"-Can you fix it? -Sure, we can."
00:06:12.789,00:06:14.374,"Thanks, Ryder."
00:06:14.457,00:06:16.250,Let's get it to the Lookout.
00:06:24.675,00:06:26.469,"Rocky, check the wheel, please."
00:06:35.478,00:06:37.230,That will hold better than before.
00:06:37.313,00:06:40.024,But my grandpa fixes everything with duct tape.
00:06:41.192,00:06:42.777,Time for the brakes.
00:06:48.032,00:06:50.284,"Don't lose it, reuse it."
00:06:50.368,00:06:52.703,And these will work better than a pizza paddle.
00:06:53.204,00:06:56.791,"Just keep your feet on the pedals at all times, okay?"
00:06:56.874,00:06:58.918,Look. Vroom!
00:06:59.001,00:07:01.254,Alex is tearing up the track.
00:07:01.337,00:07:03.297,"Vroom, vroom!"
00:07:03.881,00:07:05.299,"Vroom, vroom!"
00:07:05.383,00:07:06.634,-Uh-oh. -Whoa!
00:07:09.887,00:07:11.013,"Sorry, Chase."
00:07:11.097,00:07:13.266,"You might want to slow down a bit, Alex."
00:07:18.312,00:07:19.147,Huh?
00:07:19.230,00:07:21.732,Now I need you to rivet this in place.
00:07:25.236,00:07:26.404,You got it.
00:07:30.616,00:07:31.868,Awesome!
00:07:37.415,00:07:39.375,You can't go anywhere without this.
00:07:44.589,00:07:46.716,"Come on, Ryder. Let's race!"
00:07:46.799,00:07:48.759,"Uh, let's test it first."
00:07:49.552,00:07:53.598,"Okay, but if we race, I'm sure my super-fast super trike will win."
00:07:53.681,00:07:55.892,First you need to get used to your vehicle.
00:07:58.644,00:08:00.813,"Yeah, let's ride down the Lookout driveway."
00:08:01.939,00:08:03.816,"Vroom, vroom!"
00:08:04.901,00:08:06.736,"Alex, wait!"
00:08:06.819,00:08:08.571,You're going too fast!
00:08:08.654,00:08:10.448,"Come on, pups. Let's go."
00:08:19.957,00:08:21.667,Whee!
00:08:21.751,00:08:23.085,Look at me go.
00:08:24.795,00:08:26.422,"Wow, this is fast."
00:08:28.716,00:08:30.218,A little too fast.
00:08:31.052,00:08:32.136,Whoa!
00:08:33.095,00:08:34.222,Help!
00:08:34.305,00:08:36.432,Slow down. Use the brakes.
00:08:36.516,00:08:38.684,I can't get my feet back on the pedals.
00:08:38.768,00:08:40.520,They're turning too fast.
00:08:44.732,00:08:48.194,"Chase, secure the traffic at the bottom of the drive."
00:08:48.277,00:08:49.946,Chase is on the case.
00:08:57.203,00:08:58.579,Please stop.
00:08:58.663,00:09:01.082,PAW Patrol emergency in progress.
00:09:01.874,00:09:04.794,"Don't worry, Alex. The PAW Patrol is on it."
00:09:04.877,00:09:08.965,"Skye, I need you and your copter at the bridge in a hurry."
00:09:09.048,00:09:11.133,Let's take to the sky!
00:09:11.217,00:09:12.885,Hooray! Whoo-hoo!
00:09:17.598,00:09:20.184,Keep it straight up the bridge. You'll be fine.
00:09:25.773,00:09:28.359,"Skye, can you hook Alex's trike?"
00:09:35.783,00:09:37.743,Missed him. Coming in again.
00:09:40.371,00:09:41.622,Uh-oh.
00:09:41.706,00:09:43.374,Whoa!
00:09:43.457,00:09:45.167,Almost got it.
00:09:45.251,00:09:46.711,Whoa!
00:09:47.795,00:09:48.921,Got him!
00:09:52.717,00:09:53.926,"-Yay, Skye! -Yes!"
00:09:54.010,00:09:55.177,Great flying!
00:09:55.261,00:09:57.346,That was some pretty good flying.
00:09:57.430,00:09:59.515,"Oh, it was no biggie."
00:10:03.436,00:10:05.021,"Are you all right, Alex?"
00:10:05.104,00:10:06.897,I'm okay.
00:10:06.981,00:10:08.566,I just couldn't stop it.
00:10:08.649,00:10:10.610,The trike is too super.
00:10:12.653,00:10:16.407,I think we need to work on that braking system.
00:10:18.868,00:10:20.411,Alex.
00:10:20.494,00:10:22.121,"I'm sorry, Ryder."
00:10:22.204,00:10:23.998,This is all my fault.
00:10:24.081,00:10:27.877,"If I'd started slow like you said, this wouldn't have happened."
00:10:27.960,00:10:29.253,"That's okay, Alex."
00:10:29.337,00:10:33.257,"But whenever you try something new, you have to start out easy."
00:10:33.341,00:10:36.677,"I know. I just wanted to be like you, Ryder."
00:10:37.678,00:10:39.180,"You all right, Alex?"
00:10:39.263,00:10:41.223,"I'm great. Thanks, Skye."
00:10:41.307,00:10:43.517,And Chase and Rocky and Ryder.
00:10:43.601,00:10:45.102,And the whole PAW Patrol.
00:10:45.186,00:10:47.563,You saved me and my super trike.
00:10:47.647,00:10:48.939,It was nothing.
00:10:49.023,00:10:50.524,No problem.
00:10:50.608,00:10:53.402,"Whenever you need us, just yelp for help."
00:10:54.820,00:10:56.697,You were such good pups today.
00:10:56.781,00:10:59.533,-How about we head to the lemonade stand? -Yeah!
00:11:04.705,00:11:05.790,Alex.
00:11:05.873,00:11:08.125,-Uh-oh. -Mm-mmm.
00:11:08.209,00:11:11.128,"I mean, roll on over."
00:11:11.212,00:11:12.421,Let's go.
00:11:23.432,00:11:24.600,"Good work, Alex."
00:11:24.684,00:11:27.103,You've earned the PAW Patrol Safe Driving Cup.
00:11:27.186,00:11:29.188,"Wowee! Thanks, Ryder."
00:11:29.271,00:11:31.565,You've also won a spoon.
00:11:31.649,00:11:33.442,A spoon? Why?
00:11:33.526,00:11:35.861,'Cause it's an ice cream cup.
00:11:35.945,00:11:36.904,Yay!
00:00:49.799,00:00:52.218,"Maybe not total, Rocky."
00:00:53.386,00:00:56.347,"It might be more fun if you actually get into the water, Rocky."
00:00:56.431,00:00:58.767,And get wet? Nuh-uh.
00:00:58.850,00:01:00.727,I'm more of a dry-land surfer.
00:01:03.146,00:01:05.065,Excuse me. Sorry.
00:01:07.692,00:01:09.194,Whoa!
00:01:13.656,00:01:15.617,"Oh, hey, Rocky."
00:01:15.700,00:01:17.660,Want to come out and play volleyball with me?
00:01:21.706,00:01:22.916,"Wait, Alex."
00:01:27.629,00:01:30.215,Look both ways before you cross the road.
00:01:32.675,00:01:34.094,Okay.
00:01:36.596,00:01:37.889,"Ball, ball, ball."
00:01:41.476,00:01:42.519,I smell something.
00:01:54.614,00:01:57.992,Whoa. A baby sea turtle.
00:02:07.710,00:02:10.171,"Wow, super mini dinosaurs."
00:02:12.298,00:02:14.801,We don't want to accidentally step on them.
00:02:22.392,00:02:25.436,Whoops. I'm going to fall!
00:02:27.772,00:02:29.023,I'm good.
00:02:30.525,00:02:32.277,There's my ball.
00:02:35.321,00:02:38.408,I'm worried about these turtles getting stepped on.
00:02:38.491,00:02:41.119,I'm more worried about them getting out to the water.
00:02:41.202,00:02:45.081,Especially with that road and all the hungry seagulls around here.
00:02:47.041,00:02:49.752,How can we help these little dudes get across the road?
00:02:52.630,00:02:54.632,They need another way to the water.
00:02:54.716,00:02:56.009,I know.
00:02:56.092,00:02:59.095,"You pups go get Ryder, and I'll keep an eye on the turtles."
00:02:59.179,00:03:01.639,Whoo-hoo! Yay!
00:03:14.652,00:03:17.113,"Okay, Marshall, enough water."
00:03:17.197,00:03:18.823,"What's that, Ryder?"
00:03:18.907,00:03:21.451,Whoa! Turn off the water!
00:03:21.534,00:03:23.036,Marshall!
00:03:26.039,00:03:28.166,"-Sorry, Rubble. -Brr!"
00:03:29.417,00:03:32.795,"Thanks, but my bath day was yesterday."
00:03:37.175,00:03:39.636,"Ryder, trouble at the beach."
00:03:39.719,00:03:40.887,Trouble?
00:03:44.557,00:03:45.391,Oops.
00:03:45.475,00:03:46.851,"Sorry, Rubble."
00:03:46.935,00:03:50.355,"Ryder, baby sea turtles hatching at the beach."
00:03:50.438,00:03:54.567,We got to save them from the scooters and cars and seagulls and stuff.
00:03:54.651,00:03:56.527,"Let's go, PAW Patrol."
00:03:56.611,00:03:59.781,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:04:07.080,00:04:09.249,-Ryder needs us. -Let's go.
00:04:19.467,00:04:20.969,Whoa!
00:04:21.052,00:04:22.053,Ow.
00:04:23.680,00:04:24.806,Made it.
00:04:42.365,00:04:44.284,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:04:44.367,00:04:48.204,"PAW Patrol, there's a bunch of baby turtles that need our help."
00:04:50.456,00:04:57.839,"They've just hatched, and they need to get to the water without getting run over by bikes, scooters, skateboards, or cars."
00:04:59.382,00:05:04.470,"Chase, I need you to direct traffic so the turtles can safely cross."
00:05:05.221,00:05:07.598,These paws uphold the laws.
00:05:09.183,00:05:15.106,"Rubble, we need to build some way for the turtles to get to the water without crossing the road."
00:05:15.189,00:05:16.899,Rubble on the double.
00:05:16.983,00:05:19.944,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll.
00:05:32.623,00:05:34.167,Whee!
00:06:30.139,00:06:32.517,"-Shoo, shoo! -Go away!"
00:06:36.771,00:06:40.483,"Sorry, guys. No turtle pecking for you today."
00:06:45.071,00:06:46.697,Chase is on the case.
00:07:09.762,00:07:13.891,"That's it, turtles. Stay together and keep it moving."
00:07:14.392,00:07:18.438,Why did the turtles build their nest all the way over here?
00:07:18.521,00:07:21.107,Turtles usually nest in the same place every year.
00:07:21.190,00:07:24.026,They must have built nests here even before there was a road.
00:07:24.110,00:07:32.285,"Or maybe the turtles went through this grate, under the road, and came out here through this tunnel."
00:07:32.368,00:07:34.704,Now it's all filled up with sand.
00:07:34.787,00:07:36.414,"Can you clear that, Rubble?"
00:07:36.497,00:07:41.669,Does a belly scratcher make me flop on my back and wriggle like a worm?
00:07:41.752,00:07:43.171,You know it does.
00:07:48.759,00:07:51.345,the turtles will never have to cross the road again.
00:07:52.680,00:07:54.182,Let's dig it.
00:07:58.478,00:08:00.855,Oh no. A storm.
00:08:00.938,00:08:03.983,The ship is going over.
00:08:05.985,00:08:07.320,Uh-oh.
00:08:07.403,00:08:10.239,What are these turtles doing down here by the water?
00:08:15.244,00:08:17.788,"Look, I saved them."
00:08:17.872,00:08:19.916,Why'd you bring the turtles back here?
00:08:19.999,00:08:22.752,They were going into the water.
00:08:22.835,00:08:24.504,That's where they belong.
00:08:26.631,00:08:29.550,Sea turtles spend most of their lives in the water.
00:08:29.634,00:08:34.055,"That's why we're digging them a tunnel under the road, so they can get there safely."
00:08:35.097,00:08:36.057,Oh.
00:08:36.140,00:08:37.642,"I'd better put them back, then."
00:08:37.725,00:08:40.478,"Wait, Alex. Remember what Katie said?"
00:08:40.561,00:08:42.855,Handling the turtles is bad for them.
00:08:42.939,00:08:45.191,No person or pup should touch them.
00:08:45.816,00:08:47.276,They'll make it back on their own.
00:08:47.360,00:08:48.861,"Go, little turtles! Go!"
00:08:55.159,00:08:58.329,"Ugh, that opening's too small for my rig."
00:09:00.790,00:09:03.042,I said my rig can't go through.
00:09:21.477,00:09:22.645,Cool.
00:09:22.728,00:09:25.606,Zuma's kite-surfy thing.
00:09:27.483,00:09:32.905,"Alex Porter, kite-surfy thing champion!"
00:09:34.824,00:09:36.742,Whoa!
00:09:36.826,00:09:38.869,Cool.
00:09:38.953,00:09:41.163,I'm flying.
00:09:41.247,00:09:42.206,Uh-oh.
00:09:42.707,00:09:46.085,Help! I'm flying!
00:09:46.168,00:09:47.169,Alex?
00:09:47.253,00:09:50.381,Whoa!
00:09:53.551,00:09:55.344,"Skye, this one's for you."
00:10:00.057,00:10:02.226,This pup's got to fly.
00:10:04.020,00:10:06.105,Whoa!
00:10:06.188,00:10:08.899,"Alex, steer to the beach."
00:10:08.983,00:10:11.485,But I don't have a steering wheel.
00:10:14.071,00:10:15.323,I can't watch.
00:10:18.701,00:10:20.703,Atta pup. I knew she'd do it.
00:10:20.786,00:10:21.621,Yay!
00:10:36.719,00:10:38.596,"-You were flying! -You did it, Skye."
00:10:38.679,00:10:40.306,I was so worried.
00:10:40.389,00:10:43.559,"I mean, uh… Excellent flying."
00:10:44.352,00:10:47.229,"Yeah. Thanks a gazillion, Skye."
00:10:47.313,00:10:50.107,You're welcome. Just doing my job.
00:10:53.903,00:10:56.072,"Rubble, you're through."
00:10:56.155,00:11:01.118,Great job. Now the turtles will have a safe path to the bay for years and years.
00:11:01.202,00:11:02.912,"Hey, look."
00:11:05.414,00:11:07.083,I knew you could do it.
00:11:07.917,00:11:10.503,Whenever there's trouble just yelp for help.
00:11:12.588,00:11:15.466,You pups totally deserve some beach time.
00:11:26.936,00:11:30.272,There's something in my pocket.
00:11:31.440,00:11:33.484,"And, ow, is he ever crabby."
00:11:33.567,00:11:34.777,Ouch!
00:00:56.639,00:00:59.601,"Ryder, I found the boulders Rocky was talking about!"
00:00:59.684,00:01:01.978,They really do look like a parrot!
00:01:02.062,00:01:05.231,"That's great, Skye! Any sign of a map?"
00:01:05.315,00:01:07.317,"Hang on, I'll have a look!"
00:01:16.034,00:01:18.495,"Uh-oh, the giant eagle!"
00:01:18.578,00:01:20.997,He's not looking at me.
00:01:22.415,00:01:24.459,It's after that little bunny!
00:01:29.923,00:01:32.300,This pup's gotta fly!
00:01:40.600,00:01:42.268,Catch me if you can!
00:01:48.024,00:01:49.651,"Run, bunny, run!"
00:01:55.115,00:01:56.241,Yikes!
00:01:59.994,00:02:02.831,Whoa! Oh! Whoa!
00:02:18.138,00:02:19.848,"Great job, Skye."
00:02:19.931,00:02:21.057,"Aw, thanks, Ryder!"
00:02:21.141,00:02:23.184,"Now, let's see if we can find that map!"
00:02:32.277,00:02:35.572,Didn't the clue say in the parrot's beak?
00:02:36.072,00:02:37.907,"Is that the map, Skye?"
00:02:42.287,00:02:44.747,Maybe a piece of the map is inside!
00:02:50.003,00:02:50.879,Ah!
00:02:51.004,00:02:53.089,"Ryder, look out below!"
00:02:53.173,00:02:54.132,Got it!
00:02:54.841,00:02:56.342,There's more map in here.
00:03:00.346,00:03:01.598,No X.
00:03:14.485,00:03:18.281,"It is part of the map, and there's another clue!"
00:03:18.364,00:03:21.743,"From atop Parrot Rock, look toward the sea."
00:03:21.826,00:03:25.288,A clue hides in the hollow of a very big tree.
00:03:25.371,00:03:28.958,"If we can solve that clue, we should find the treasure."
00:03:35.548,00:03:38.885,The biggest trees around are in the forest where Little Hootie lives.
00:03:38.968,00:03:40.386,"Good thinking, Chase."
00:03:40.470,00:03:42.096,"Then, let's go check them out!"
00:03:42.180,00:03:45.225,Argh! We're gonna find some treasure!
00:03:46.351,00:03:48.603,"Hey, wait for me!"
00:03:54.192,00:03:56.236,These trees are huge!
00:03:56.319,00:03:58.363,And lots of them have knotholes.
00:03:58.446,00:04:03.243,I'm going to the find the rest of Captain Blackfur's map! Argh!
00:04:06.621,00:04:08.706,"Ooh, ooh, yuck!"
00:04:08.790,00:04:12.418,"Uh, Rubble, don't you mean argh?"
00:04:14.045,00:04:15.255,Nope!
00:04:15.338,00:04:18.049,"Yuck, yuck, yuck! Spider!"
00:04:28.017,00:04:31.187,"No clues in there, just a family of spiders."
00:04:31.271,00:04:33.606,"Ew, spider cooties!"
00:04:40.446,00:04:42.824,"Not in there, either."
00:04:42.907,00:04:44.158,Just dust.
00:04:48.830,00:04:50.415,How's it going?
00:04:50.498,00:04:52.375,We're up to our tails in trees!
00:04:55.086,00:04:56.170,"Hi, Little Hootie!"
00:04:57.463,00:05:01.175,Have you seen an old bottle in the knothole of any of these trees?
00:05:17.358,00:05:18.818,Here I come!
00:05:19.652,00:05:22.238,"Yes, Little Hootie was right!"
00:05:25.366,00:05:26.701,"Thanks, Little Hootie."
00:05:26.784,00:05:28.119,See you soon!
00:05:30.288,00:05:31.331,Bye!
00:05:38.421,00:05:39.797,I caught it!
00:05:39.881,00:05:41.215,"Nice catch too, Ryder."
00:05:43.926,00:05:45.386,"Nice job, Marshall!"
00:05:45.470,00:05:46.596,What is it? What is it?
00:05:46.679,00:05:50.350,"If this is the third piece of the map, it should fit with the second piece."
00:05:50.433,00:05:51.559,"I've got it, Ryder!"
00:05:55.396,00:05:56.689,"Thanks, Rocky!"
00:05:56.773,00:05:58.483,Now we have the whole map.
00:05:58.566,00:06:00.193,And guess what else is on here?
00:06:00.276,00:06:02.570,X! X marks the spot!
00:06:02.653,00:06:03.905,Whoo-hoo!
00:06:03.988,00:06:05.531,"I mean, argh!"
00:06:05.615,00:06:08.284,Let's find the pirate treasure!
00:06:10.119,00:06:11.913,First I have to read the clue.
00:06:11.996,00:06:17.085,"Walk 20 paces from the tree, toward setting sun and rising sea."
00:06:17.168,00:06:18.461,What's that mean?
00:06:18.544,00:06:21.798,"Well, the sun sets that way, over the sea."
00:06:21.881,00:06:24.592,"So, I walk 20 steps in that direction."
00:06:24.675,00:06:26.386,And we'll find the treasure!
00:06:26.469,00:06:27.804,Here it goes.
00:06:27.887,00:06:40.233,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine-- Whoa doesn't come after nine. Ten does."
00:06:40.817,00:06:44.904,"If I took step ten, I'd fall right into the ocean."
00:06:45.488,00:06:47.198,"Oh, the map must be wrong."
00:06:47.281,00:06:51.202,"Or the pirates took teeny, tiny steps."
00:06:55.206,00:06:56.916,Whoa!
00:06:58.918,00:06:59.836,Close one.
00:06:59.919,00:07:02.588,"Sorry, I got twinkle-toed away."
00:07:04.382,00:07:08.094,"There's something out there, but it's hard to see with all the fog in the way."
00:07:08.177,00:07:12.932,Do you think it's mysterious Captain Blackfur's old ship?
00:07:13.015,00:07:14.308,Let's find out!
00:07:22.108,00:07:23.943,"It's a pirate ship for sure, Ryder!"
00:07:24.026,00:07:25.778,I can see the flag!
00:07:25.862,00:07:27.989,Can we go see if there's treasure on it?
00:07:28.698,00:07:30.533,That old ship is falling apart.
00:07:32.368,00:07:37.707,"We need to get it on land, fast, before the tide comes in and the waves break it into pieces."
00:07:37.790,00:07:40.042,"Argh, then let's bring 'er in!"
00:07:40.126,00:07:44.964,"The ship's pretty big, but if we all work together, maybe we can do it."
00:07:51.554,00:07:53.139,The channel is done!
00:07:53.222,00:07:56.100,"Now, we can drag the boat right up the beach."
00:07:56.184,00:07:57.768,My forklift is set!
00:07:57.852,00:07:59.729,Winch is ready when Ryder is!
00:07:59.812,00:08:01.105,All set!
00:08:10.531,00:08:12.074,That's my signal!
00:08:19.165,00:08:20.500,-We did it! -It's working!
00:08:20.583,00:08:22.084,"How's it look up there, Skye?"
00:08:22.168,00:08:23.836,Steady as she goes!
00:08:26.088,00:08:27.131,Whoa!
00:08:27.215,00:08:28.424,Look at the anchor chain.
00:08:32.512,00:08:33.846,Something's wrong.
00:08:36.098,00:08:38.309,Let's see if we can free that anchor.
00:09:04.377,00:09:05.670,Here comes the ship!
00:09:12.468,00:09:13.594,Want to take a ride?
00:09:13.678,00:09:14.804,Let's do it!
00:09:21.477,00:09:24.438,"Ahoy, land-lubbers! It's Captain Blackfur!"
00:09:26.399,00:09:28.192,Yay!
00:09:31.445,00:09:40.329,"I am thrilled and proud to play such a very, very, very important part in solving the mystery of the pirate Captain Blackfur!"
00:09:42.832,00:09:45.418,"Okay, everyone, let's see what's in the ship."
00:09:48.045,00:09:49.755,"Marshall, put up your ladder!"
00:09:49.839,00:09:51.132,"Aye-aye, Ryder."
00:09:51.882,00:09:54.135,"Cap'n Turbot, can you give me a hand?"
00:09:54.218,00:09:55.636,"Sure thing, Ryder!"
00:09:56.679,00:09:57.805,Let's go!
00:09:58.848,00:10:00.850,-Hooray! -Wahoo!
00:10:02.893,00:10:05.187,Argh! I can't wait!
00:10:05.271,00:10:06.439,Me neither!
00:10:06.522,00:10:08.399,What do you think the treasure could be?
00:10:11.068,00:10:11.944,Wow!
00:10:12.028,00:10:14.113,-A real treasure! -Pirate booty!
00:10:14.196,00:10:17.199,"-Thanks, Cap'n. -Thank you for saving me from that cave!"
00:10:17.283,00:10:21.787,"Whenever there's a problem, just yelp, or argh, for help."
00:10:23.080,00:10:24.999,"-Yeah, open it, Ryder! -Open it!"
00:10:25.082,00:10:26.459,"Yeah, let's see what's inside!"
00:10:28.419,00:10:30.046,"Sorry, it's locked."
00:10:39.305,00:10:40.181,Awesome!
00:10:40.264,00:10:41.557,-Wow! -Whoa!
00:10:41.641,00:10:43.643,-Awesome! -Cool!
00:10:43.726,00:10:45.519,A gold dog bone!
00:10:45.603,00:10:46.771,Cool!
00:10:49.190,00:10:51.942,"Ah, not good for chewing, though."
00:10:52.026,00:10:54.195,A super fancy dog bowl!
00:10:54.278,00:10:57.323,This must have belonged to a super fancy pup.
00:10:57.406,00:11:00.076,Why would a pirate captain have a dog bowl?
00:11:00.159,00:11:03.829,Maybe mysterious Captain Blackfur had a faithful pup!
00:11:05.831,00:11:08.250,"No, that's why!"
00:11:08.876,00:11:10.419,Look!
00:11:10.503,00:11:13.214,This is the mysterious Captain Blackfur?
00:11:13.714,00:11:16.759,It's not that the captain had a pirate pup.
00:11:19.553,00:11:23.641,"He looks just like me, except for the black fur beard."
00:11:23.724,00:11:28.771,"Oh, wait, wait! This paper contains a prominent pronouncement of the pirate pup."
00:11:28.854,00:11:36.529,"He who finds this chest my pirate command obey, and return this treasure to the good people of Adventure Bay!"
00:11:36.612,00:11:37.863,Like you!
00:11:37.947,00:11:41.659,"You're all good, every last pirate pup of you!"
00:11:41.742,00:11:43.035,Argh!
00:11:43.119,00:11:44.328,"Ahoy, land-lubbers!"
00:12:09.770,00:12:12.565,"Argh, shiver me timbers!"
00:00:52.302,00:00:56.264,"Mmm, I love watching Tug-a-Pillow and eating snacks."
00:00:56.973,00:00:59.434,And I love sleeping out under the stars.
00:01:01.269,00:01:02.353,Perfect!
00:01:06.900,00:01:09.486,"Okay, let's try this again."
00:01:11.988,00:01:14.324,"Last biscuit, who wants it?"
00:01:14.991,00:01:16.076,I do! I do! I do!
00:01:20.997,00:01:22.332,"Sorry, Chase!"
00:01:22.916,00:01:25.251,Evening under the stars ruined.
00:01:39.682,00:01:43.394,"Hmm, the lighthouse light doesn't look like it's working right."
00:01:57.784,00:01:59.327,I better tell Cap'n Turbot.
00:02:02.539,00:02:06.417,"-Cap'n Turbot? -Ryder, is that you?"
00:02:07.001,00:02:09.129,"I mean, it's kind of hard to see in this fog."
00:02:09.212,00:02:11.714,"Cap'n Turbot, the light went out in your lighthouse!"
00:02:11.798,00:02:14.759,"What?! Oh, that's not good."
00:02:14.843,00:02:16.636,I know. Can you fix it?
00:02:16.761,00:02:18.221,"Oh, of course, I can fix it."
00:02:20.765,00:02:23.852,This fog is so thick I can't sail back without the lighthouse.
00:02:32.026,00:02:34.487,"Without a light, I can't get home to fix my lighthouse."
00:02:34.571,00:02:40.827,"Oh, plus a big cruise ship full of people is going to pass by Seal Island in exactly one hour!"
00:02:40.910,00:02:42.745,That ship will need the light too!
00:02:42.829,00:02:47.834,"Yes, if the ship can't see the lighthouse, it could sail too close to shore and hit the rocks!"
00:02:47.917,00:02:49.961,I can't let that happen!
00:02:51.379,00:02:54.048,"Oh, I better call Ryder and the PAW Patrol."
00:02:59.387,00:03:01.014,"Ryder, I need help!"
00:03:02.307,00:03:05.226,"There's no light in the lighthouse, and I can't see!"
00:03:07.395,00:03:09.689,"Oh, that's going to leave a bruise."
00:03:15.653,00:03:17.572,I knew I could count on you.
00:03:19.574,00:03:21.951,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:03:28.666,00:03:30.126,Ryder needs us.
00:03:30.710,00:03:32.503,-Yeah! -Let's go!
00:03:41.429,00:03:42.680,Wait for me!
00:03:54.984,00:03:57.570,"Hey, Marshall, you weren't the last pup in this time."
00:04:00.823,00:04:02.116,Hmm. All better.
00:04:19.550,00:04:21.552,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:04:26.432,00:04:28.643,A thick fog is coming across the bay.
00:04:28.726,00:04:32.272,"Cap'n Turbot is stuck at sea, and the lighthouse light is out."
00:04:32.355,00:04:35.149,Ships really need the lighthouse in the fog.
00:04:35.775,00:04:39.487,"If we don't fix the light, the cruise ship could hit Seal Island."
00:04:39.570,00:04:40.863,We need to act fast.
00:04:44.450,00:04:47.620,You'll ride Chase across the water on your hovercraft.
00:04:48.413,00:04:49.956,Let's dive in!
00:04:52.583,00:04:54.544,I need you out at Seal Island.
00:04:54.627,00:04:58.715,We can use your light in the lighthouse until Cap'n Turbot gets back.
00:04:58.798,00:05:01.134,"Chase is on the case, Ryder, sir."
00:05:01.217,00:05:04.762,"The rest of you, stay awake. I may need you."
00:05:04.846,00:05:07.348,PAW Patrol is on a roll.
00:06:03.571,00:06:05.281,The fog is coming in fast.
00:06:05.365,00:06:07.825,It's going to reach Seal Island soon.
00:06:07.909,00:06:09.285,We have to hurry.
00:06:26.469,00:06:32.058,I'm wide… … awake-ish.
00:06:32.141,00:06:34.185,Let's play a game while we wait.
00:06:34.268,00:06:35.978,How about Marco Polo?
00:06:36.062,00:06:38.481,"Okay, I'll be it! I'll be it! I'll be it!"
00:06:39.899,00:06:42.610,Put these on and then you can try and find us.
00:06:46.197,00:06:47.824,"Oh, good idea."
00:06:47.907,00:06:49.909,-Marco! -Polo!
00:06:49.992,00:06:51.702,"Where are you, Skye?"
00:06:51.786,00:06:53.162,"Aha, there you are!"
00:06:59.127,00:07:00.086,Who bit my tail?
00:07:02.338,00:07:03.423,What's that?
00:07:04.257,00:07:05.174,Wally?
00:07:12.557,00:07:16.978,"Come on, Wally. Let us pass. We have to get the lighthouse light on."
00:07:19.063,00:07:21.065,"This isn't time for playing, Wally."
00:07:21.149,00:07:23.526,But maybe it's time for a snack.
00:07:23.609,00:07:24.902,I'd love a snack.
00:07:24.986,00:07:26.362,I'm starving.
00:07:26.446,00:07:28.030,I mean Wally.
00:07:28.114,00:07:30.450,I think he's trying to tell us he wants a treat.
00:07:31.784,00:07:33.035,"Here you go, Wally."
00:07:36.789,00:07:40.585,"Whew, come on, pups. The fog is getting close."
00:07:40.668,00:07:42.545,It's almost at the island.
00:07:58.186,00:08:01.022,The cruise ship is headed right for Seal Island!
00:08:01.105,00:08:05.693,"Chase, get your light to the top of the lighthouse so the cruise ship will know to stay away."
00:08:05.776,00:08:07.278,"I'm on it, sir."
00:08:17.663,00:08:20.124,The ship's almost here! Hurry!
00:08:24.212,00:08:25.463,Locked.
00:08:27.798,00:08:29.258,"Ryder, is that you?"
00:08:29.342,00:08:31.511,I can barely see anything in this fog.
00:08:31.594,00:08:34.013,I can negotiate nearly nothing at all!
00:08:34.096,00:08:35.973,The lighthouse door is locked.
00:08:36.057,00:08:37.850,Is there a key around here somewhere?
00:08:41.354,00:08:43.773,"Oh, that's not much help, is it?"
00:08:45.942,00:08:47.151,"Hang in there, Cap'n."
00:08:49.362,00:08:51.948,Fog's getting thicker. I can't see a thing!
00:08:58.162,00:09:02.458,"Chase, shoot your net on the side of the lighthouse wall, just below the window."
00:09:02.542,00:09:04.043,"I'm on it, sir!"
00:09:07.880,00:09:09.215,Yeah!
00:09:14.345,00:09:16.222,I'm in! Be right down!
00:09:18.474,00:09:19.934,Let's roll.
00:09:23.145,00:09:25.398,"Yes, way to go, Ryder."
00:09:25.481,00:09:26.899,Let's roll!
00:09:41.038,00:09:44.500,This is the captain of the cruise ship Princess Maria.
00:09:44.584,00:09:47.086,We can't see your light. Over!
00:09:47.169,00:09:49.880,"This is Seal Island Lighthouse, Captain."
00:09:53.259,00:09:54.176,…now!
00:10:01.100,00:10:03.352,We're turning away from you and the rocks.
00:10:03.436,00:10:05.605,Thank you and out!
00:10:08.566,00:10:11.736,"PAW Patrol, you did it! And just in the nick of time!"
00:10:11.819,00:10:13.946,"Nice work, Zuma and Chase!"
00:10:14.030,00:10:16.991,"Yes, you did a great job, puppies. Way to go."
00:10:17.074,00:10:18.117,Oh yeah!
00:10:20.953,00:10:23.581,"Um, sunglasses at night?"
00:10:23.664,00:10:24.540,What for?
00:10:25.541,00:10:28.085,-So I can fix the lighthouse. -Huh?
00:10:28.878,00:10:30.504,"Cover your eyes, everyone."
00:10:33.341,00:10:34.383,-Yeah! -Yeah!
00:10:36.052,00:10:37.345,"Thanks again, Ryder."
00:10:37.428,00:10:41.599,"You and the PAW Patrol saved the day, the cruise ship, and me."
00:10:41.682,00:10:42.850,"Anytime, Cap'n."
00:10:42.933,00:10:45.686,"If you're ever in trouble, just yelp for help."
00:10:55.196,00:10:58.783,"…wide awake, in case Ryder needs us."
00:10:58.866,00:11:01.994,"Yup, I'm wide awake too."
00:11:03.454,00:11:05.331,"-Hi, pups. -Ryder!"
00:11:05.414,00:11:06.499,What happened?
00:11:10.586,00:11:12.505,We can't wait to hear what happened.
00:11:12.588,00:11:14.715,Even if it takes all night.
00:11:14.799,00:11:17.218,"Good job staying awake, pups."
00:11:17.301,00:11:21.055,I'm going to go grab some sleep-out snacks and tell you all about it.
00:11:28.270,00:11:30.106,I'll save them for you.
00:00:54.429,00:00:56.514,"Now, that's a real pup tent!"
00:00:56.598,00:01:00.060,I can't wait to go sleep in the woods in the tent tonight!
00:01:00.143,00:01:02.228,And get some Pup Scout badges!
00:01:02.312,00:01:05.273,I'm working on my Pup Scout Tent-Building badge!
00:01:17.702,00:01:21.498,"Uh, is there a Pup Scout badge for tree-climbing?"
00:01:22.832,00:01:29.631,"No, but we do have badges for Cleanest Canoe, Wiggiest Wigwam-Weaver, Gooiest Roasted Marshmallow."
00:01:32.217,00:01:34.677,And Most Excited New Camper!
00:01:38.306,00:01:39.516,-Yay! -Cool.
00:01:39.599,00:01:43.436,You should probably get going if you want to be at your campsite before dark.
00:01:49.734,00:01:51.111,"Have fun, pups!"
00:01:51.194,00:01:52.195,Hooray!
00:01:58.159,00:01:59.160,All done!
00:02:01.830,00:02:02.705,Huh?
00:02:02.789,00:02:04.666,Must be tight from being rolled up.
00:02:06.918,00:02:07.752,Whoa!
00:02:09.212,00:02:10.421,Uh-oh!
00:02:11.506,00:02:13.800,Maybe it needs a little weight on the end.
00:02:13.883,00:02:14.968,Chickaletta!
00:02:25.228,00:02:26.104,That did it!
00:02:29.482,00:02:30.817,"Oops, uh, sorry."
00:02:32.402,00:02:41.744,"Fit tent pole A into tent pole-holder B, Ta-da!"
00:02:42.787,00:02:43.872,Not quite.
00:02:45.331,00:02:46.875,"Ah, perfect!"
00:02:51.588,00:02:54.299,Such a good helper!
00:02:54.382,00:02:57.552,"Oh, but this task requires the right tool."
00:03:10.940,00:03:12.817,Tents and sleeping bags are ready!
00:03:12.901,00:03:14.777,Is it time to make a campfire?
00:03:14.861,00:03:18.489,Let's see what the Pup Scout camping app says.
00:03:18.573,00:03:23.912,"Uh, To set up the fire pit, first clear all leaves and twigs that might catch fire from sparks."
00:03:25.163,00:03:26.206,Pincers!
00:03:31.419,00:03:33.046,Twigs cleared away!
00:03:34.130,00:03:35.548,Leaves cleared away!
00:03:35.632,00:03:37.008,Great job!
00:03:37.091,00:03:40.053,"Next, make a ring of rocks on a dirt area."
00:03:45.767,00:03:47.810,"Well done, Pup Scouts!"
00:03:54.692,00:03:59.197,"Oh, that gets you an Animal Identification badge!"
00:04:01.783,00:04:03.743,we need bigger pieces of wood for the fire.
00:04:03.826,00:04:06.996,"Camping is just like fetch, without the throwing!"
00:04:14.003,00:04:17.257,You just earned a Tidy Firewood badge!
00:04:17.340,00:04:20.677,This bucket of sand is in case we need to put out the campfire.
00:04:21.261,00:04:27.350,"Now, everything's set except-- Ah, that's right!"
00:04:27.433,00:04:29.852,The key is finding the perfect stick.
00:04:39.070,00:04:40.488,Oh!
00:04:41.447,00:04:42.365,Too flimsy.
00:04:48.079,00:04:51.499,Hmm… too short.
00:04:58.798,00:05:00.133,Chickaletta?
00:05:07.890,00:05:11.477,"Easy, Chickaletta! No need to panic!"
00:05:11.561,00:05:14.647,This is a total disaster! Rocky! Skye!
00:05:15.648,00:05:16.816,It's Chickaletta!
00:05:16.899,00:05:18.359,She's fallen down there!
00:05:26.743,00:05:29.370,"Sorry, I can't reach you!"
00:05:29.454,00:05:32.707,"I'd fly down to her, but it's too narrow for my wings."
00:05:46.387,00:05:48.222,"Hi, Mayor Goodway! What happened?"
00:05:51.100,00:05:52.143,We're on it!
00:05:52.226,00:05:54.854,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:05:57.106,00:05:59.525,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:06:03.071,00:06:04.113,Wait for me!
00:06:10.787,00:06:11.829,All good.
00:06:30.056,00:06:31.891,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:06:33.309,00:06:35.686,"Thanks for coming so quickly, pups."
00:06:35.770,00:06:38.606,I just got a call from Mayor Goodway and the Pup Scouts.
00:06:38.689,00:06:39.941,Is Skye okay?
00:06:40.024,00:06:41.901,"Er, I mean, are they okay?"
00:06:41.984,00:06:47.115,"The pups are fine, but Chickaletta's stuck in a cave in the ground and can't get out."
00:06:47.198,00:06:50.743,"She's too deep for Rocky to reach, so we're going to have to help."
00:06:52.328,00:06:55.164,"Chase, we'll need your winch to pull Chickaletta out."
00:06:55.248,00:06:57.208,Chase is on the case!
00:06:59.335,00:07:02.422,"Rubble, we'll need your rig to clear the rocks from the edge."
00:07:02.505,00:07:04.757,Rubble on the double!
00:07:04.841,00:07:07.802,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:08:25.087,00:08:29.634,Poor Chickaletta must be so frightened with all the creatures lurking in the darkness.
00:08:29.717,00:08:31.385,"Ah, like that! It has my leg!"
00:08:35.598,00:08:38.559,"Aw, what a cute little bunny!"
00:08:41.646,00:08:43.606,I have my Bunny Care badge.
00:08:44.315,00:08:45.983,Let's check on Chickaletta.
00:08:46.067,00:08:49.529,"Chase, shine your light so Rubble can clear the loose rocks."
00:08:49.612,00:08:51.030,You got it!
00:08:57.870,00:08:59.247,All clear!
00:08:59.330,00:09:00.414,"Thanks, Rubble!"
00:09:00.498,00:09:02.166,"Don't worry, Chickaletta."
00:09:02.250,00:09:03.626,We'll get you out soon!
00:09:03.709,00:09:06.879,"Chickaletta! Are you all right, my little chick-chick?"
00:09:08.339,00:09:09.382,Oh.
00:09:12.093,00:09:14.845,I need a small pup to ride down on the winch.
00:09:30.861,00:09:32.613,Almost there!
00:09:32.697,00:09:34.115,"Hey, Chickaletta!"
00:09:36.409,00:09:38.077,I can carry you!
00:09:39.787,00:09:43.082,Or… you could just ride on my head.
00:09:43.165,00:09:45.001,"Okay, bring us up!"
00:09:45.084,00:09:46.586,I'm on it!
00:09:48.838,00:09:51.465,I never knew chicken feet were so ticklish!
00:09:53.426,00:09:54.844,"Can you spot me, Rocky?"
00:09:54.927,00:09:56.304,You got it!
00:09:59.015,00:09:59.932,Almost there!
00:10:02.143,00:10:03.311,Yay!
00:10:03.394,00:10:06.564,Yes! Chickaletta's okay! She's okay!
00:10:08.065,00:10:09.650,Yes! Skye's okay!
00:10:09.734,00:10:11.152,She's okay!
00:10:11.235,00:10:13.738,"Aw, you were worried!"
00:10:13.821,00:10:15.656,"Uh, no, I wasn't!"
00:10:15.740,00:10:18.200,"I'm just, uh, glad you saved Chickaletta!"
00:10:18.284,00:10:21.162,"Thanks, Chase. That's very sweet."
00:10:21.245,00:10:26.083,"Well, after an exciting rescue like that, there's only one thing left to do."
00:10:26.167,00:10:28.336,Roast marshmallows!
00:10:32.882,00:10:34.759,What a beautiful night!
00:10:34.842,00:10:38.095,"Yeah, it's so nice here, we should all camp out!"
00:10:38.179,00:10:39.805,If you Pup Scouts don't mind.
00:10:43.225,00:10:46.312,"Fantastic idea, but there aren't enough tents."
00:10:55.946,00:10:59.408,"Okay, time to learn the most important camping skill of all."
00:10:59.492,00:11:03.954,Marshmallow… …and corn roasting.
00:11:06.540,00:11:15.883,"Chickaletta, you get a Pup Scout badge for bravery, and I have a very special Chickaletta Rescue badge -for the PAW Patrol! -Thanks, Mayor!"
00:11:15.966,00:11:18.761,"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!"
00:11:20.054,00:11:22.139,I burned the marshmallows!
00:11:22.223,00:11:23.224,Burned?
00:11:28.187,00:11:30.523,Uh-oh. Whoa!
00:11:32.108,00:11:33.609,"Sorry, pups."
00:00:52.427,00:00:53.720,Almost there.
00:00:58.475,00:01:00.185,It sure is windy today.
00:01:02.020,00:01:03.938,"It's just us, Rubble and Skye."
00:01:04.022,00:01:04.939,Can we help?
00:01:05.023,00:01:09.152,Sure. There's still tons to do for Chase's surprise birthday party.
00:01:09.986,00:01:11.237,Streamers away.
00:01:17.285,00:01:18.286,Launch!
00:01:20.163,00:01:21.164,"Sorry, Cali."
00:01:21.748,00:01:22.582,Hmph!
00:01:35.845,00:01:37.347,it'll be awesome!
00:01:38.306,00:01:40.141,"Next up, the birthday cake."
00:01:40.225,00:01:45.105,Who's making sure Chase doesn't surprise us -while we set up his surprise party? -Yeah?
00:01:47.232,00:01:49.818,Sure. Marshall can keep a secret.
00:01:50.652,00:01:51.778,Can't he?
00:01:54.697,00:01:57.408,"Come on, Chase. Let's go slide."
00:01:57.492,00:02:00.662,"But, Marshall, we just played on the slide a few minutes ago."
00:02:00.745,00:02:05.125,"Oh, yeah. Um… let's-- Is something wrong, Marshall?"
00:02:07.502,00:02:10.630,It's not like I have a big secret I'm not supposed to tell.
00:02:16.761,00:02:19.013,"Wow, it's so windy."
00:02:19.097,00:02:21.474,Maybe we should go find Ryder and the pups.
00:02:21.558,00:02:26.312,"No! No, I mean… uh… It's so nice outside."
00:02:31.860,00:02:33.361,Whoa!
00:02:36.030,00:02:37.448,It really is windy.
00:02:48.168,00:02:49.294,What happened?
00:02:52.255,00:02:54.090,All the lights on the street are out.
00:02:56.092,00:02:59.846,Hmm… There's plenty of wind to turn the windmill.
00:02:59.929,00:03:01.931,I wonder if the turbine broke.
00:03:03.057,00:03:07.896,"If the lights are out on Main Street, something must be wrong with one of the windmill turbines."
00:03:07.979,00:03:11.232,"Without electricity, my electric cake mixer won't work."
00:03:13.318,00:03:14.444,Or lights.
00:03:14.527,00:03:17.238,And maybe no surprise party for Chase.
00:03:19.574,00:03:23.369,No way. We're going to throw Chase a party no matter what.
00:03:23.453,00:03:26.581,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:03:28.625,00:03:30.543,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:03:32.503,00:03:34.047,An emergency!
00:03:34.130,00:03:37.550,I'll bet it has something to do with all this heavy wind! Come on!
00:03:40.929,00:03:43.723,"For once, I'm going to be the first one in the elevator."
00:03:43.806,00:03:44.891,"Marshall, wait!"
00:03:44.974,00:03:50.521,No electricity means… Never mind.
00:03:50.605,00:03:54.943,No electricity means the Lookout doors won't open automatically.
00:03:55.026,00:03:56.819,I'd better tell the other pups.
00:04:01.199,00:04:03.910,"Uh, pups, the Lookout doors aren't working."
00:04:03.993,00:04:05.787,But our gear is in the Lookout.
00:04:05.870,00:04:08.081,Don't worry. We'll get our gear.
00:04:08.164,00:04:09.958,"Rocky, screwdriver, please."
00:04:17.090,00:04:18.258,"You can do it, Ryder."
00:04:28.268,00:04:32.105,"Marshall, I need to get up to the Lookout and see what happened to the windmill."
00:04:32.188,00:04:33.481,Let's use your truck.
00:04:35.858,00:04:37.193,"Careful, Ryder."
00:04:37.277,00:04:38.736,"Will do, Marshall."
00:04:54.752,00:04:57.088,That's why there's no electricity.
00:05:03.303,00:05:05.221,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:05:08.474,00:05:11.269,The strong winds broke a blade on one of the windmills.
00:05:11.352,00:05:16.065,That's why there's no power on Main Street or here at the Lookout. We need to fix it.
00:05:17.108,00:05:21.154,"Rocky, I need you to find something in your truck to fix the broken blade."
00:05:21.237,00:05:23.239,Green means go!
00:05:28.244,00:05:30.496,"I'm fired up, Ryder!"
00:05:30.580,00:05:33.583,"Ryder, what about Chase's party?"
00:05:33.666,00:05:35.585,"You're in charge of that, Skye."
00:05:37.837,00:05:41.257,"Chase, the traffic lights won't work without electricity."
00:05:41.341,00:05:44.177,I need your siren and megaphone to help direct traffic.
00:05:44.260,00:05:46.429,These paws uphold the laws.
00:05:46.512,00:05:50.099,"Skye, Rubble, and Zuma, you know what to do."
00:05:51.684,00:05:53.353,PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:06:20.171,00:06:21.547,"Ready to go, Ryder."
00:06:22.131,00:06:23.883,"Ryder, you coming?"
00:06:29.597,00:06:32.892,Got it! PAW Patrol is on a roll.
00:06:49.409,00:06:51.536,Time to save Chase's party.
00:06:51.619,00:06:52.995,But all the lights are out.
00:06:53.079,00:06:54.455,What are we gonna do?
00:06:54.539,00:07:04.090,"Hmm… Yeah! We'll give Chase the best surprise birthday party, in the dark, ever!"
00:07:13.015,00:07:17.478,We can't even cross the street in this mess and it's getting dark.
00:07:18.062,00:07:21.649,Uh-oh! Good thing Chase is on the case.
00:07:26.279,00:07:29.782,"Okay, everyone going this way, go now."
00:07:31.492,00:07:32.994,"Okay, stop."
00:07:33.077,00:07:36.038,"All the cars going that way, go now."
00:07:38.499,00:07:40.793,"Okay, now it's safe to cross."
00:07:41.461,00:07:43.129,Our hero.
00:07:43.212,00:07:45.590,Just doing my PAW Patrol duty.
00:07:58.895,00:08:01.772,Let's get the electricity working for Chase's party.
00:08:04.025,00:08:06.152,I'll find something to fix it with.
00:08:06.736,00:08:08.446,"Marshall, I need your ladder."
00:08:08.529,00:08:09.489,Coming right up.
00:08:20.416,00:08:23.669,"All right, let set up Chase's party in the dark!"
00:08:23.753,00:08:25.838,We have to have some games.
00:08:25.922,00:08:27.673,"Let's show them, Katie."
00:08:27.757,00:08:34.639,"Take it, Skye."
00:08:39.185,00:08:41.896,We can play flashlight tag. I'm it!
00:08:52.031,00:08:53.991,"Okay, Rocky, you're up!"
00:08:56.118,00:08:59.288,I have got the perfect thing in here… somewhere.
00:08:59.372,00:09:01.290,"Lawn chair, nope."
00:09:01.374,00:09:04.126,"An old tire, nope."
00:09:04.669,00:09:05.628,Great!
00:09:08.047,00:09:09.924,Zuma's old surfboard.
00:09:12.468,00:09:13.761,That's perfect.
00:09:18.224,00:09:22.103,This surfboard will catch a breeze and turn it into electricity.
00:09:24.730,00:09:25.856,Coming down!
00:09:26.732,00:09:31.487,"With the surfboard attached to the blade and the blade back on the windmill, we should be all set."
00:09:31.571,00:09:33.072,The wind is picking up again.
00:09:47.086,00:09:49.213,Playing in the dark is really fun.
00:09:58.014,00:09:59.473,"-Yay, lights! -Thank goodness."
00:09:59.557,00:10:01.767,Ryder and the PAW Patrol did it!
00:10:01.851,00:10:04.061,But there's no time to make a cake.
00:10:08.107,00:10:10.318,Ryder and the PAW Patrol fixed it!
00:10:10.985,00:10:13.279,"All right, everyone, it's safe to cross."
00:10:13.362,00:10:15.281,"Whoo-hoo! Thanks, Chase."
00:10:15.364,00:10:17.825,Guess my job here is done.
00:10:19.577,00:10:21.537,"Chase, change of plans."
00:10:21.621,00:10:23.873,"We need you at Katie's, in a hurry."
00:10:28.210,00:10:31.297,"Skye, head's up, Chase is on his way."
00:10:31.380,00:10:33.090,-And so are we. -Great.
00:10:33.174,00:10:35.176,The surprise is all ready.
00:10:41.057,00:10:43.893,Hello? Anybody home?
00:10:46.479,00:10:48.856,"-Whoa! -Happy birthday, Chase."
00:10:48.939,00:10:52.818,"We couldn't make you a regular cake, so I hope you like your dog cookie cake."
00:10:52.902,00:10:57.448,Wow! You guys turned the lights back on and made a party for me?
00:10:57.531,00:11:00.743,"Whenever it's your birthday, just yelp for help."
00:11:03.913,00:11:08.167,"It's Chase's birthday party, but you've all been really good pups."
00:11:08.250,00:11:09.460,Make a wish.
00:11:29.397,00:11:31.023,"Happy birthday, Chase."
00:11:31.107,00:11:33.401,This is the best birthday ever!
00:01:00.769,00:01:01.603,Yes!
00:01:01.686,00:01:02.896,I found a tugging toy!
00:01:02.979,00:01:04.606,Me too!
00:01:06.316,00:01:08.234,A good old stinky one!
00:01:54.322,00:01:55.448,"What's wrong, Chase?"
00:02:09.546,00:02:13.383,Phew… Alex?
00:02:15.552,00:02:17.971,Sorry. I was going out to play.
00:02:18.888,00:02:20.557,"Okay, but don't go far."
00:02:20.640,00:02:22.767,I'm taking you to the dentist soon.
00:02:22.851,00:02:27.981,Aw… Do I have to? My teeth are healthy.
00:02:28.064,00:02:29.232,See?
00:02:30.233,00:02:32.443,I'll call you when it's time to go.
00:02:33.653,00:02:35.029,"You okay, Chase?"
00:02:37.282,00:02:39.159,Loose teeth are awesome!
00:02:39.242,00:02:43.288,"When you put them under your pillow, the Tooth Fairy leaves something great!"
00:02:43.371,00:02:44.873,"What's going on, pups?"
00:02:44.956,00:02:46.708,Chase got a loose tooth.
00:02:46.791,00:02:48.251,"Hey, let's see!"
00:02:54.883,00:02:58.678,Dentist? No way! My tooth is fine!
00:03:01.931,00:03:05.185,"I can't go to the dentist, Grandpa. Look."
00:03:06.811,00:03:08.146,The ladder broke!
00:03:08.229,00:03:10.190,"Broken ladder, hmm?"
00:03:10.273,00:03:12.859,Guess I'll have to borrow one to help you down.
00:03:12.942,00:03:14.360,Yes!
00:03:14.444,00:03:16.988,There won't be enough time to go to the dentist.
00:03:17.071,00:03:20.283,"Oh, I bet the PAW Patrol can get you down in time."
00:03:21.951,00:03:24.913,I still think you should let the dentist take a look.
00:03:26.664,00:03:27.749,Ryder here.
00:03:27.832,00:03:29.667,"Hi, Ryder. It's Mr. Porter."
00:03:29.751,00:03:31.127,We need a little help.
00:03:31.211,00:03:33.922,Alex got himself stuck in his tree fort.
00:03:34.005,00:03:35.089,What happened?
00:03:38.218,00:03:41.387,"We need to get him down soon, or he'll miss his dentist appointment."
00:03:44.432,00:03:49.520,"The PAW Patrol will race over, help Alex down, and get him to the dentist."
00:03:49.604,00:03:51.439,You don't have to race.
00:03:51.522,00:03:54.692,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:04:05.703,00:04:06.537,Whoa!
00:04:08.498,00:04:10.458,Anyone want to play tug toy?
00:04:28.059,00:04:30.186,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:04:31.562,00:04:32.897,"Thanks for hurrying, pups."
00:04:35.233,00:04:37.735,We need to help him get down and to the dentist.
00:04:38.987,00:04:42.573,"Marshall, I need your ladder to reach Alex in his tree house."
00:04:42.657,00:04:44.075,I'm fired up!
00:04:57.380,00:04:59.299,PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:06:06.657,00:06:08.868,"Thanks for getting here so fast, Ryder."
00:06:08.951,00:06:10.078,No problem.
00:06:15.583,00:06:16.542,"Hi, Alex."
00:06:16.626,00:06:17.960,You can come down now.
00:06:18.044,00:06:19.712,I can't come down.
00:06:19.796,00:06:21.381,"Well, why not?"
00:06:21.464,00:06:23.007,I'm kind of scared.
00:06:26.886,00:06:30.473,Not of the ladder! I'm scared of the dentist.
00:06:30.556,00:06:31.391,Huh?
00:06:31.474,00:06:35.395,"There's no reason for Alex to be afraid, right, Chase?"
00:06:40.608,00:06:42.402,Whoops! Ah! Oh!
00:06:49.909,00:06:51.577,Ready to go to the dentist?
00:06:54.539,00:06:56.499,Really? Cool!
00:06:57.500,00:07:00.753,I'll go with Chase… but not to the dentist.
00:07:00.837,00:07:02.088,You're a little scared?
00:07:02.171,00:07:05.133,"Nuh-uh, I'm a lot scared."
00:07:05.216,00:07:07.969,That's okay. Everyone's scared of something.
00:07:08.845,00:07:10.596,Not you and the PAW Patrol.
00:07:10.680,00:07:12.140,Of course we are.
00:07:12.640,00:07:13.724,I Know!
00:07:13.808,00:07:19.272,"Alex, if I can get the PAW Patrol to do things they're scared of, will you go to the dentist?"
00:07:20.898,00:07:24.485,"Well, I would like to see what the pups are scared of."
00:07:24.569,00:07:27.655,I'll call the pups. You get ready for the dentist.
00:07:30.074,00:07:34.912,"Okay, pups, we need to help Alex -get over his fear of the dentist. -How?"
00:07:34.996,00:07:37.874,I want you pups to do one thing you're afraid of.
00:07:37.999,00:07:39.584,Who wants to go first?
00:07:41.419,00:07:55.141,"-Uh… -Well… -Um… -Um… -Well… -Uh… With the PAW Patrol, I do scary stuff, like hang from Skye's helicopter or climb icy cliffs."
00:07:55.224,00:07:57.602,But you know what really gives me nightmares?
00:07:57.685,00:07:59.103,-No. -What?
00:07:59.187,00:08:02.440,"Mr. Porter, some Brussels sprouts, please."
00:08:02.523,00:08:04.192,"Coming right up, Ryder."
00:08:06.360,00:08:07.653,Here they are.
00:08:10.531,00:08:22.001,Ah… …bad.
00:08:22.084,00:08:24.754,"Nice try, but I don't think so."
00:08:32.220,00:08:38.059,"Um, well, uh… Go ahead, Marshall."
00:08:39.769,00:08:40.895,Hose!
00:08:42.688,00:08:43.648,"Ready, Rocky?"
00:08:43.731,00:08:44.732,Ready.
00:08:54.951,00:08:56.827,And Rubble is afraid of spiders.
00:08:56.911,00:08:58.621,Spider!
00:09:00.998,00:09:03.543,Not scared. not scared.
00:09:03.626,00:09:05.711,Am I done not being scared yet?
00:09:05.795,00:09:07.088,Sure.
00:09:07.171,00:09:08.923,Ew! Spider cooties!
00:09:10.174,00:09:11.676,Now Skye and Marshall.
00:09:17.139,00:09:19.058,Marshall's scared of flying.
00:09:19.141,00:09:21.102,This isn't so bad.
00:09:30.987,00:09:34.782,Whoa! Whoa! I really don't like flying.
00:09:34.865,00:09:36.284,Cool!
00:09:37.159,00:09:39.537,Ah… pavement.
00:09:43.165,00:09:46.043,You see? Everyone's scared of something.
00:09:46.127,00:09:49.714,But sometimes you need to do things even though you're scared.
00:09:49.797,00:09:53.009,"If you pups can be brave, so can I!"
00:09:53.092,00:09:55.261,I'm going to the dentist.
00:09:57.722,00:10:01.851,"Alex, could you help one last pup be brave too?"
00:10:01.934,00:10:04.270,-Who? -Huh?
00:10:04.353,00:10:07.315,"Chase, he's afraid of the dentist too."
00:10:14.030,00:10:15.573,Sure I can!
00:10:30.755,00:10:32.673,Let's go in at the same time!
00:10:32.757,00:10:33.758,Okay!
00:10:41.974,00:10:44.101,The dentist was super nice.
00:10:44.185,00:10:47.188,She gave me a sticker and a toothbrush!
00:10:49.690,00:10:52.318,She showed us how to brush and keep our teeth healthy!
00:10:52.401,00:10:57.281,"That's right! The dentist pulled my tooth, but a new one will grow back. See?"
00:11:00.159,00:11:04.830,"Remember, whenever you need a little extra courage, just yelp for help!"
00:11:04.914,00:11:06.916,Or whistle. Listen.
00:11:06.999,00:11:09.377,I can whistle where my tooth used to be.
00:11:13.756,00:11:16.550,"That's a ginormous tooth, dude."
00:11:16.634,00:11:19.970,The Tooth Fairy's going to give you an extra big treat!
00:11:30.064,00:11:32.274,The Tooth Fairy left a brand new bone!
00:00:50.425,00:00:52.135,"Nice bubble updo, Rubble."
00:00:52.218,00:00:54.387,You mean nice bubble pup-do.
00:00:56.097,00:00:59.267,"Okay, Rubble, time to get you out and styled for the Puptacular."
00:00:59.851,00:01:03.772,I can't believe I'm competing in a puppy show.
00:01:03.855,00:01:05.857,"If we win Best Styled Pup, we get a trophy."
00:01:05.940,00:01:07.275,And a bone.
00:01:19.871,00:01:21.289,"Oh, me too."
00:01:21.372,00:01:23.583,I feel like such a bubblehead.
00:01:31.341,00:01:35.053,"Come on, Rubble. We have to make sure our trucks are in tip-top shape."
00:01:38.014,00:01:39.891,"Uh, sorry, Katie."
00:01:39.974,00:01:42.227,I can't help you with the Puptacular show.
00:01:42.310,00:01:46.231,It's okay. Making sure your trucks are safe is more important.
00:01:46.314,00:01:48.274,I'm sure some other pup will help me out.
00:01:51.152,00:01:52.445,Flip you for it.
00:01:54.572,00:01:55.907,"Go for it, Zuma."
00:02:04.499,00:02:07.585,"Everything looks good on the underside of my vehicle, pups."
00:02:09.879,00:02:11.756,I'm finished topping up the radiator.
00:02:19.013,00:02:20.098,"Hello, Ryder?"
00:02:20.181,00:02:21.766,Mayor Goodway. What's up?
00:02:21.850,00:02:23.685,Funny you should ask.
00:02:23.768,00:02:29.899,Chickaletta and I were picnicking on the beach when she dropped her favorite rubber ducky into the bay.
00:02:29.983,00:02:31.609,So we rode out to get it.
00:02:31.693,00:02:33.444,Aw. Did she get it back?
00:02:33.528,00:02:36.406,"No, and Chickaletta is quite upset."
00:02:36.489,00:02:41.536,"And hard as I row, the silly tide keeps taking us the wrong way."
00:02:41.619,00:02:44.205,"Of course, dropping the oars overboard didn't help."
00:02:44.289,00:02:46.499,The tide is taking you out to sea?
00:02:46.583,00:02:48.459,"Mayor, that's an emergency."
00:02:48.543,00:02:50.837,"I know. Ryder, help!"
00:02:50.920,00:02:55.175,"Don't worry, Mayor. No job is too big. No pup is too small."
00:03:01.097,00:03:04.017,I know. You can't compete in the Puptacular show.
00:03:04.100,00:03:07.520,"But my fur's never been softer, if that makes a difference."
00:03:08.897,00:03:11.149,Maybe I should just wait for the Cat-tacular.
00:03:18.823,00:03:21.117,"Marshall, your water cannon."
00:03:21.201,00:03:22.744,I don't want to get wet!
00:03:22.827,00:03:26.080,Don't worry. It won't spray unless I bark like this.
00:03:27.290,00:03:28.833,-Oops. -Yikes!
00:03:28.917,00:03:30.710,Ah!
00:03:30.793,00:03:32.253,"Sorry, Zuma."
00:03:32.337,00:03:34.672,That's the second bath I've had today.
00:03:42.555,00:03:45.934,"Ugh, someone smells like a wet dog."
00:04:03.326,00:04:05.370,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:04:10.041,00:04:14.045,We need to get them back to land and find Chickaletta's rubber ducky.
00:04:14.128,00:04:16.381,Aw. Poor little chicken.
00:04:18.424,00:04:20.260,Who doesn't love the rubber ducky?
00:04:21.636,00:04:25.390,"Zuma, I need you and your buoy and rope to tow them back to the beach."
00:04:25.473,00:04:26.933,Let's dive in.
00:04:28.017,00:04:32.230,"Skye, I need you to use your goggles to be our eyes in the sky."
00:04:32.313,00:04:35.441,Look for the mayor and Chickaletta's favorite rubber ducky too.
00:04:39.737,00:04:42.282,Looks like it's going to be a pretty wet rescue.
00:04:42.365,00:04:44.242,Can't stand getting wet.
00:04:45.910,00:04:46.786,All right!
00:04:46.869,00:04:48.871,PAW Patrol is on a roll.
00:06:09.702,00:06:12.413,The tide is dragging her boat out to sea.
00:06:13.623,00:06:15.625,"Thanks, Skye. We're on our way."
00:06:21.130,00:06:23.424,"Let's finish checking our trucks, Rubble."
00:06:23.508,00:06:25.468,Rubble on the double.
00:06:25.968,00:06:27.553,"What do you want to do, Chase?"
00:06:27.637,00:06:28.721,I don't know.
00:06:30.014,00:06:31.933,"Hi, Rocky. Hi, Chase."
00:06:32.016,00:06:32.934,Is Zuma there?
00:06:33.017,00:06:35.895,Not right now. Ryder needed him for a rescue.
00:06:40.316,00:06:43.194,Do either of you want to be in a pup show with me?
00:06:43.277,00:06:49.534,"Not me. A show means washing, and washing means water, and water's not my thing."
00:06:49.617,00:06:51.661,"Don't worry, Katie. I'll do it."
00:06:51.744,00:06:53.371,Chase is on the case.
00:06:53.454,00:06:55.206,"Thanks, Chase. Come on over."
00:06:55.289,00:06:56.332,On my way.
00:06:57.500,00:07:00.628,"Come on, Rocky. I promise you won't get wet."
00:07:00.711,00:07:04.549,"Okay. But remember, not a drop."
00:07:08.886,00:07:09.804,That's them.
00:07:12.098,00:07:13.391,Over here!
00:07:13.474,00:07:16.018,"We're coming, Mayor. Stay calm."
00:07:17.520,00:07:20.189,I'm calm! I'm calm!
00:07:20.273,00:07:22.483,"Look, Chickaletta. It's Ryder."
00:07:24.026,00:07:29.490,The PAW Patrol has saved the-- No!
00:07:29.574,00:07:30.783,Chickaletta!
00:07:30.867,00:07:32.910,"Chickaletta, hold on."
00:07:34.537,00:07:36.873,"Ryder, I spotted the rubber ducky."
00:07:39.041,00:07:41.586,Tell Chickaletta I'm flying it to her.
00:07:42.253,00:07:44.839,I'll tell her as soon as I get her out of the water.
00:07:45.339,00:07:48.009,Chickaletta! Where are you?
00:07:48.092,00:07:51.137,"Oh, Ryder, you must save my precious chicken."
00:07:53.014,00:07:54.098,There she is.
00:07:54.182,00:07:55.600,"Hang on, Chickaletta."
00:07:55.683,00:07:56.684,I got her.
00:08:11.449,00:08:13.326,"I've got you, Chickaletta."
00:08:13.409,00:08:14.577,Hurry!
00:08:18.122,00:08:19.457,Whoo! Yeah!
00:08:20.750,00:08:22.502,"Oh, Chickaletta!"
00:08:22.585,00:08:25.505,You're soaked and it's all my fault.
00:08:25.588,00:08:27.715,"Okay, let's tow this boat home."
00:08:35.973,00:08:37.808,"Call the police, pup. Block traffic."
00:08:37.892,00:08:40.811,We must get her home and dry. This is an emergency!
00:08:48.069,00:08:50.404,"Oh, that's the spot too."
00:08:54.992,00:08:57.036,Oh no. Not again.
00:08:58.788,00:09:02.833,I need you to block traffic so we can get her home and dry as fast as possible.
00:09:02.917,00:09:04.210,This is an emergency!
00:09:04.293,00:09:06.212,"Chase is on the case, sir."
00:09:07.547,00:09:10.800,"Sorry, Katie, but… I know. Duty calls."
00:09:11.551,00:09:14.345,Oh well. There goes the Puptacular contest.
00:09:15.680,00:09:18.099,I can't go to the Puptacular show without a pup.
00:09:22.728,00:09:25.690,"Oh, Rocky, you're the best pup ever."
00:09:28.192,00:09:31.529,"Hey, this bath isn't so bad after all."
00:09:35.324,00:09:36.993,Oh. Right.
00:09:37.076,00:09:40.413,Isn't there a way to give me a dry wet bath?
00:09:45.251,00:09:47.587,Green means go!
00:09:49.422,00:09:52.717,Ew. This water's all wet.
00:09:54.385,00:09:56.429,"Okay, here goes."

00:01:00.310,00:01:01.478,Told you I got it.
00:01:02.687,00:01:04.522,"What a wipe-out, Chase!"
00:01:04.606,00:01:06.316,"Even your tail said, Ow!"
00:01:08.109,00:01:09.861,"That wasn't me, Rubble."
00:01:09.944,00:01:11.821,That ow came from out there!
00:01:13.448,00:01:14.949,Is that a kitten?
00:01:15.033,00:01:16.993,Sounds like she's in trouble.
00:01:17.077,00:01:18.411,Let's go help her!
00:01:29.339,00:01:32.801,Uh-oh! That little kitty's headed out to the deep water!

00:01:56.074,00:01:57.575,Oh! Oh no!
00:02:08.253,00:02:09.420,"What's wrong, pups?"
00:02:11.965,00:02:13.842,We have to save her!
00:02:13.925,00:02:17.095,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:02:17.178,00:02:18.763,I'll call the rest of the PAW Patrol.

00:03:04.517,00:03:05.518,"Okay, pups."
00:03:08.313,00:03:12.525,A kitten is stuck on a toy boat and is floating out to sea!
00:03:12.609,00:03:15.445,"Toy boat, toy boat, toy-- Ah, it's so hard to say!"

00:05:31.622,00:05:33.082,Let's dive in!
00:05:40.631,00:05:43.384,"Don't worry, little kitten. We're here to help."
00:05:43.468,00:05:45.803,"Aw, you're so cute!"
00:05:46.888,00:05:48.765,"Ah, cute but jumpy!"
00:05:48.848,00:05:49.974,Whoa!
00:05:53.144,00:05:54.270,"Don't touch that, Kitty."
00:05:54.354,00:05:59.984,The hovercraft might… …take off.
00:06:00.068,00:06:01.903,"Come on, let's go after her!"
00:06:10.912,00:06:14.082,How could something so little go so fast?
00:06:26.427,00:06:28.096,"Hang on, we'll get her!"
00:06:32.392,00:06:33.810,She's coming right at us!
00:06:33.893,00:06:35.269,Get ready to drive!
00:06:41.692,00:06:43.945,"Don't worry, Kitty. Everything's all right."
00:06:44.070,00:06:46.364,There we go. It's all over.
00:06:48.282,00:06:50.785,Let's get you back to dry land. Huh?
00:06:51.869,00:06:53.621,And get you cleaned up!
00:06:59.001,00:07:01.045,with his new BFF!
00:07:03.381,00:07:04.841,Nobody knows.
00:07:04.924,00:07:07.635,We found her in the bay on a toy sailboat.
00:07:07.718,00:07:10.221,"Hmm, no collar or tags."
00:07:10.972,00:07:13.015,"Nope, just this ribbon."
00:07:17.645,00:07:19.021,"Want me to do it, Rubble?"
00:07:26.446,00:07:28.114,Not this little sweetie.
00:07:33.077,00:07:35.496,"Okay, the water's just right."
00:07:35.580,00:07:38.624,Soon you'll be a pretty itty-witty-bitty kitty!
00:07:44.380,00:07:45.465,"Kitty, no!"
00:07:45.548,00:07:46.507,Stop!
00:07:49.552,00:07:52.388,"Come back, itty-bitty-witty-- Whoa!"
00:08:02.773,00:08:07.403,"Ryder, there's a little girl here looking for a lost kitty named Precious."
00:08:07.487,00:08:08.404,Look!
00:08:13.618,00:08:14.535,My board!
00:08:16.037,00:08:16.871,Huh?
00:08:18.039,00:08:21.000,Uh-oh! We just saw Precious skateboard by!
00:08:22.084,00:08:23.002,Precious!
00:08:24.629,00:08:27.340,That witty-itty-bitty kitty took my board!
00:08:34.222,00:08:35.056,Huh?
00:08:35.723,00:08:38.476,Whoa!
00:08:39.060,00:08:41.229,"Ah, still got it!"
00:08:41.312,00:08:42.480,Oh!
00:08:42.563,00:08:43.814,Or not.
00:08:46.400,00:08:47.985,We have to find the kitten!
00:08:49.779,00:08:52.198,"Time for your super-sniffer, Chase!"
00:08:52.281,00:08:54.325,I need something with her scent on it.
00:08:54.408,00:08:58.079,"I have her ribbon, but be careful with it."
00:09:08.422,00:09:09.632,She's close!
00:09:15.346,00:09:17.807,Precious was definitely on this skateboard.
00:09:17.890,00:09:19.350,"Good sniffing, Chase!"
00:09:46.085,00:09:49.130,I need you and your fire truck as quick as you can!
00:09:49.213,00:09:50.506,I'm fired up!
00:10:00.641,00:10:02.351,"Marshall, put up your ladder."
00:10:02.435,00:10:03.728,The kitten is up there!
00:10:10.735,00:10:12.570,"Careful, Marshall!"
00:10:15.197,00:10:17.575,Don't worry. I'll get you down safely.
00:10:20.828,00:10:22.330,Whoa!
00:10:22.413,00:10:23.831,Get off my face!
00:10:23.914,00:10:25.291,Ah!
00:10:26.375,00:10:27.835,"Hang on, Marshall!"
00:10:27.918,00:10:29.045,Precious!
00:10:29.128,00:10:31.756,"Marshall, come back down!"
00:10:31.839,00:10:32.757,Coming!
00:10:37.720,00:10:38.763,Gotcha!
00:10:43.059,00:10:46.020,"Oh, Precious! I was so worried!"
00:10:48.731,00:10:53.778,"You have to thank all these brave pups who saved you, and you too!"
00:10:53.861,00:10:55.905,Thank you for saving my kitty.
00:10:55.988,00:10:57.490,You're all heroes!

00:11:11.712,00:11:13.798,You deserve some special treats!
00:00:52.052,00:00:53.136,Yee-haw!
00:00:53.219,00:00:55.597,I'm a square dancing cow pup.
00:00:59.559,00:01:02.145,"You play a mean washtub bass, Mayor Goodway."
00:01:06.524,00:01:10.987,Adventure Bay's Western Town Hoedown is going to be the best ever!
00:01:11.071,00:01:14.616,"Yeah, check out my square dance super spin."

00:01:33.134,00:01:35.470,"That was a super spin, all right!"
00:01:40.433,00:01:43.812,Sorry. Guess that move still needs a little work.
00:01:54.322,00:01:55.615,"I mean, cows."
00:02:02.831,00:02:05.667,"Whoa! No, no! Wait! Come back!"
00:02:05.750,00:02:08.419,"Bessie, Bernie, Gertie, Gussy!"

00:02:27.105,00:02:33.736,And the winner is… …a cow?!
00:02:38.950,00:02:40.535,Hello. Ryder here.
00:02:40.618,00:02:43.788,"Hello, Ryder? It's Al from Moo Juice Dairy Farm."
00:02:43.872,00:02:45.665,I need help! It's an emergency.
00:02:45.748,00:02:48.376,"Howdy, Al. Did you happen to lose a cow?"
00:02:50.044,00:02:53.381,My very best milk cows escaped from their train car.
00:02:53.464,00:02:54.716,"Hey, how did you know?"
00:02:56.801,00:02:58.720,One just ran through our hoedown.
00:02:58.803,00:03:02.265,I got to get those cows back on the train before it leaves without us.
00:03:02.348,00:03:03.641,Can the PAW Patrol help?
00:03:05.059,00:03:07.770,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:03:07.854,00:03:10.857,And now cow moo-ves too fast.
00:03:10.940,00:03:12.108,"Thanks, Ryder."
00:03:12.942,00:03:15.153,Edwina! Gotta go!
00:03:16.154,00:03:18.072,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:03:25.538,00:03:27.081,See? I'm not last.

00:03:51.856,00:03:53.775,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:03:55.193,00:03:57.987,"Thanks for coming so fast, pups."
00:03:58.071,00:04:03.660,Farmer Al's five cows escaped from their train car and they're stampeding all over Adventure Bay!
00:04:04.744,00:04:08.790,We need to get all the cows back on the train before it leaves.
00:04:09.874,00:04:22.804,"Skye, I'll need you to spot the cows from the air Chase, I'll need you and your megaphone to help heard them back to the train."
00:04:22.887,00:04:25.139,Chase is on the case!
00:04:25.223,00:04:28.810,"Okay, pups, the rest of you may as well go and enjoy the hoedown."
00:04:30.478,00:04:33.439,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:05:36.836,00:05:40.298,"Come back! Edwina, please!"
00:05:45.094,00:05:47.430,Edwina! Come back!
00:05:47.513,00:05:50.266,Ooh! Sorry. That's my cow.
00:05:54.687,00:05:55.772,Edwina!
00:05:55.855,00:05:56.731,"Howdy, Al."
00:05:56.814,00:05:58.816,"Hi, Ryder. Thanks for coming so quickly."
00:05:58.900,00:06:00.985,The train's going to start up again soon!

00:06:22.840,00:06:24.884,"One down, four more to go."
00:06:24.967,00:06:25.802,"Thanks, Chase!"
00:06:26.969,00:06:27.970,Nice work.
00:06:28.054,00:06:30.598,I hope all the cows are that easy to round up.
00:06:30.681,00:06:33.017,"Don't worry, Al. You keep an eye on Edwina."
00:06:33.101,00:06:35.853,We'll round up the others before the train leaves.
00:06:37.355,00:06:38.815,"Here you go, girl."
00:06:41.317,00:06:43.653,Uh-oh! Sounds like a cattle jam.
00:06:43.736,00:06:44.695,Let's go!
00:06:49.909,00:06:55.456,"Ryder, two cows are in the middle of Hill Street, causing all sorts of traffic problems!"
00:06:55.540,00:06:57.041,I'm on my way!
00:07:00.711,00:07:02.171,"Chase, your siren."
00:07:02.255,00:07:03.506,"You got it, Ryder!"
00:07:10.930,00:07:14.100,"You get that cow, Chase. I'll get the one headed up to Yumi's."

00:07:21.065,00:07:23.025,Ha! I gotcha!
00:07:24.569,00:07:25.695,Whoa!
00:07:35.621,00:07:38.541,"Chase, I've got the one up here at Yumi's farm."
00:07:38.624,00:07:39.917,Good thing it's hungry.
00:07:40.001,00:07:42.336,"And I'll bring my cow up to you, Ryder."
00:08:02.356,00:08:03.191,Oh no.
00:08:09.405,00:08:11.032,"Um, Ryder?"
00:08:11.115,00:08:13.409,A cow is out on a boat on the bay.
00:08:13.493,00:08:14.410,What?
00:08:21.209,00:08:23.586,Yee-haw!
00:08:31.594,00:08:33.971,"I'm ready to dive in, Ryder."
00:08:35.056,00:08:36.307,What about our game?
00:08:36.390,00:08:38.142,There's a cow on a boat on the bay!
00:08:47.735,00:08:49.820,"How now, sailor cow?"
00:08:52.990,00:08:54.617,"Okay, don't worry!"
00:08:54.700,00:08:56.244,I'll get you back to shore.
00:08:59.247,00:09:01.582,Aha! Perfect ringer! Come on.
00:09:01.666,00:09:03.668,Let's get you on solid ground.
00:09:12.093,00:09:17.098,"Ryder, a cow is on Mr. Porter's patio and it's eating all his corn!"
00:09:19.433,00:09:22.186,"Oh, never mind. Okay, I'm on it."
00:09:26.607,00:09:29.318,"Ryder, the train's about to leave. Any luck?"
00:09:29.402,00:09:33.364,"Yup! We found all the cows, Al. We just have to get them to the train."
00:09:34.740,00:09:36.450,Hurry. The train's ready to go!
00:09:36.534,00:09:38.786,I can't leave without my cows.
00:09:42.206,00:09:43.958,"Hey, Chase, how are your cows?"
00:09:46.794,00:09:49.171,Can you get them to the train station by yourself?
00:09:49.255,00:09:51.007,"I am a herding dog, sir."
00:09:51.090,00:09:53.551,"Okay, meet me at the train station."
00:09:53.634,00:09:56.971,"All right! Get along, little moo-cow. Ha!"
00:10:00.141,00:10:00.975,Whoa!
00:10:02.518,00:10:04.478,Wait! Come back!
00:10:06.063,00:10:07.815,Yee-haw!
00:10:07.898,00:10:09.984,"Get along, little moo-cows."
00:10:15.114,00:10:16.824,"-Come on, pups… -Whoo-hoo!"
00:10:36.636,00:10:41.349,Wow! A genuine Wild West cattle drive and square dancing?
00:10:41.432,00:10:44.477,"This is the best hoedown ever, Mayor Goodway!"
00:10:44.560,00:10:46.062,"Aw, shucks."
00:10:46.145,00:10:48.356,"Mighty kind of you to say, little partner."
00:11:01.118,00:11:02.578,That was amazing!
00:11:02.662,00:11:05.414,"It was fun, a real cowboy adventure."
00:11:05.498,00:11:08.417,"If you ever need us, just yee-haw for help."
00:11:08.501,00:11:09.418,Whoo-hoo!
00:11:12.338,00:11:14.131,"Ooh, time to go!"
00:11:18.552,00:11:21.597,Let's go to the hoedown! Yee-haw!
00:00:51.885,00:00:54.888,Wow! I just can't get your pup house clean.
00:00:54.971,00:00:57.015,We need some soapy water.
00:01:00.560,00:01:03.104,The Alex Patrol is on a roll!
00:01:03.188,00:01:04.898,No sponge is too big.
00:01:04.981,00:01:18.828,"No Alex is too small… Sorry, Marshall. Sorry, Rocky."
00:01:20.830,00:01:23.166,You still saved the day by bringing the sponge.
00:01:23.249,00:01:26.169,I did? Yes!
00:01:27.462,00:01:29.422,But it wasn't a real rescue.
00:01:29.506,00:01:32.634,Maybe someday I'll be a part of a real rescue.
00:01:35.678,00:01:37.764,"Thanks for fixing Bettina's pen, Rubble."
00:01:37.847,00:01:39.557,"You're welcome, Farmer Yumi."
00:02:45.832,00:02:48.918,"Chickaletta, what's got your eggs in a scramble?"
00:02:59.179,00:03:00.722,That roof's too high to play on!
00:03:02.807,00:03:04.684,I'm calling the PAW Patrol!
00:03:12.901,00:03:15.778,"Sorry, Ryder. Bettina's just really worried about Cali."
00:03:15.862,00:03:17.655,Why? What's wrong?
00:03:17.739,00:03:19.449,She's stuck on top of the silo.
00:03:22.452,00:03:25.538,"Don't worry, Farmer Yumi, or you, Bettina."
00:03:27.665,00:03:30.835,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:03:30.919,00:03:32.045,We're on our way!
00:03:33.588,00:03:36.049,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:03:37.842,00:03:41.221,What is it? An emergency? Oh boy!
00:03:41.304,00:03:43.556,Looks like it. We'd better go.
00:03:44.307,00:03:52.232,"Okay, this time, I'm going to make extra, extra, extra sure that I don't crash into any pups in the elevator door."
00:04:00.823,00:04:04.369,Why do emergencies always happen during nap time?
00:04:04.452,00:04:06.913,That's all the pups! Coast is clear.
00:04:11.000,00:04:12.001,"Sorry, pups."
00:04:32.647,00:04:36.526,Whoa… I can't believe I'm inside the Lookout!
00:04:37.902,00:04:39.570,"Thanks for hustling, pups."
00:04:39.654,00:04:41.990,We've got a real emergency on our hands.
00:04:42.073,00:04:44.993,Cali is stuck on top of Farmer Yumi's silo.
00:04:46.077,00:04:47.912,It's not safe to be up so high.
00:04:47.996,00:04:49.455,We need to get her down.
00:04:50.748,00:04:54.294,"Marshall, I need you and your ladder to safely get to Cali."
00:04:54.377,00:04:57.547,"Ready for a ruff, ruff rescue!"
00:04:57.630,00:05:00.383,This is so cool!
00:05:02.719,00:05:07.765,"Skye, I need you and your helicopter to take one of the pet carriers over to the farm."
00:05:07.849,00:05:10.393,We might be able to get Cali to climb into it.
00:05:13.521,00:05:14.480,"Ooh, ooh!"
00:05:14.564,00:05:17.191,"Ryder, pick me! I'm super helpful!"
00:05:17.275,00:05:18.735,"I know you are, Alex."
00:05:18.818,00:05:21.529,But we need to get to Farmer Yumi's fast.
00:05:24.532,00:05:27.493,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:05:34.500,00:05:37.337,Wow! That's so cool!
00:05:38.963,00:05:39.881,Yeah!
00:05:42.759,00:05:45.011,That's even cooler!
00:06:22.715,00:06:25.927,I'm great! All buckled in and ready to roll!
00:06:28.721,00:06:33.393,"Well, we fell down the slide and, uh, landed in my fire truck."
00:06:35.853,00:06:39.023,As long as he promises to listen and not get in the way.
00:06:39.899,00:06:41.401,I promise!
00:07:12.306,00:07:13.766,Please? Can I?
00:07:13.850,00:07:15.977,Sure. Hit the button.
00:07:33.411,00:07:36.664,"Thanks for racing out here, Ryder. Cali's up there."
00:07:38.040,00:07:39.500,"I can try to get her, Ryder."
00:07:39.584,00:07:41.919,That's a long way up for you and your ladder.
00:07:42.003,00:07:45.631,It'll be easier if Cali tries to climb into Skye's pet carrier.
00:07:45.715,00:07:47.300,"I can help too, Ryder."
00:07:47.383,00:07:48.885,"I know you can, Alex."
00:07:48.968,00:07:51.554,"But right now, let's see if Skye can get Cali."
00:07:51.637,00:07:55.808,"Okay, Skye, see if Cali will climb into the pet carrier!"
00:07:55.892,00:07:58.811,"Moving the pet carrier into position, Ryder."
00:07:58.895,00:08:00.146,This is tricky.
00:08:00.229,00:08:03.065,I have to place it just right.
00:08:08.070,00:08:11.991,"Skye, Cali's too scared to climb into the carrier!"
00:08:12.074,00:08:13.993,We need to try something else!
00:08:19.540,00:08:22.543,Plan B? Cool!
00:08:23.044,00:08:24.545,What's Plan B?
00:08:24.629,00:08:26.672,Plan B is Marshall and his ladder.
00:08:26.756,00:08:27.840,"Ready, Marshall?"
00:08:27.924,00:08:31.052,"You got it, Ryder. I'm fired up!"
00:08:49.779,00:08:54.575,Come on. Just slide to me here. I got you.
00:08:58.704,00:09:00.873,That's it. Come on.
00:09:06.087,00:09:08.214,Hey… what's this?
00:09:09.298,00:09:11.509,Hey! Who turned out the lights?
00:09:11.592,00:09:12.718,Whoa! Whoa!
00:09:17.265,00:09:18.516,Whoa!
00:09:21.477,00:09:23.604,Poor thing's too scared to let you help.
00:09:23.688,00:09:26.649,"We have to get Cali to slide down the roof to you, Marshall."
00:09:26.732,00:09:28.776,"I know, but how?"
00:09:37.285,00:09:38.244,"Hang on, Alex."
00:09:38.327,00:09:41.330,We're trying to figure out how to get Cali off the silo.
00:09:41.414,00:09:43.124,I think maybe I know.
00:09:43.207,00:09:46.961,If only we had something to make Cali want to slide down.
00:09:49.797,00:09:52.466,"Hmm… No. Sorry, Ryder."
00:09:52.550,00:09:55.303,"Chickaletta, Bettina, can you think of anything?"
00:09:58.389,00:10:00.558,I know! I know! Ryder!
00:10:00.641,00:10:02.685,"I really, really, really know!"
00:10:07.565,00:10:09.442,"Great idea, Alex!"
00:10:09.525,00:10:12.945,"Marshall, see if you can get Cali to come get her toy."
00:10:13.029,00:10:15.197,All right. I'm fired up!
00:10:26.208,00:10:28.878,"Cali, just slide down to me!"
00:10:28.961,00:10:32.006,I'll catch you and I'll give you this!
00:10:37.928,00:10:39.221,Whoa!
00:10:45.144,00:10:46.687,"Marshall, you got Cali!"
00:10:48.397,00:10:49.649,Is everyone all right?
00:10:49.732,00:10:53.861,"Everyone is fine and safe, thanks to Alex."
00:10:53.944,00:10:57.573,The PAW Patrol are the real rescuers. I just helped a little.
00:10:57.657,00:11:00.159,"Well, Cali seems to think you helped a lot, Alex."
00:11:01.702,00:11:04.372,"Aw… You're welcome, Cali."
00:11:04.455,00:11:09.001,"If you ever need us, just yelp for help… or yelp for Alex."
00:11:10.461,00:11:11.712,Alex Patrol!
00:11:13.172,00:11:18.511,"Pups, you sure did a good job today, and, Alex, you did a great job."
00:11:18.594,00:11:22.348,"So, I'm making you an honorary member of the PAW Patrol."
00:11:22.431,00:11:24.392,"Wow! Thanks, Ryder!"
00:11:24.475,00:11:25.768,"You're welcome, Alex."
00:11:25.851,00:11:29.730,"Thanks, PAW Patrol! This was the best day ever!"
00:11:29.814,00:11:32.483,"-Hooray, Alex! -Way to go, Alex!"
00:11:35.027,00:11:37.738,Good pups! You're good pups!
00:00:49.841,00:00:51.676,"Ready for another bean, Farmer Yumi!"
00:00:51.760,00:00:53.344,"Right behind you, Rubble."
00:01:09.069,00:01:11.321,"No, no, Chickaletta!"
00:01:17.744,00:01:21.081,"Look out for Giant Alex, 'cause here I come!"
00:01:22.332,00:01:25.168,"Careful, Giant Alex. Don't squash the beans."
00:01:29.631,00:01:32.759,"Whew, it sure is hot. Why don't we take a little break?"
00:01:32.842,00:01:34.219,Great idea!
00:01:38.389,00:01:43.937,"Ah, nothing like digging all morning to get ready for a nice afternoon nap."
00:02:13.007,00:02:14.092,Whoa!
00:02:24.936,00:02:25.854,Whoa!
00:02:25.937,00:02:27.730,A giant Alex!
00:02:27.814,00:02:28.731,Ah!
00:02:35.405,00:02:39.033,"Fee, fi, fo, fum!"
00:02:46.040,00:02:48.168,"Oops, sorry, Bettina."
00:02:48.960,00:02:51.337,Moo!
00:03:01.097,00:03:03.892,"Ryder, we have a giant emergency!"
00:03:03.975,00:03:05.101,"Don't worry, Rubble."
00:03:05.185,00:03:07.729,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:03:07.812,00:03:11.274,This is a real giant emergency! Look!
00:03:11.357,00:03:12.317,Neat!
00:03:16.279,00:03:18.239,"Can you and the PAW Patrol help out, Ryder?"
00:03:18.323,00:03:19.908,You weren't kidding!
00:03:19.991,00:03:23.703,"Still, no job is too big, not even a giant Alex!"
00:03:24.871,00:03:27.415,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:03:47.393,00:03:48.895,Hi!
00:03:48.978,00:03:50.021,Bye!
00:03:57.528,00:03:59.447,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:04:02.867,00:04:09.707,"Fee, fi… Giant Alex doesn't mean any harm, but his giant size could cause a lot of trouble around Adventure Bay."
00:04:09.791,00:04:13.294,We have to protect our town and get Alex back up the beanstalk!
00:04:13.378,00:04:15.380,This will take the whole PAW Patrol!
00:04:42.031,00:04:44.534,"Hey, Rubble, I'll help you get to your truck!"
00:04:44.617,00:04:47.203,"No, I don't need any help!"
00:04:51.541,00:04:54.335,But you're our emergency!
00:05:07.348,00:05:10.184,Let's split up. We can cover more ground that way.
00:05:19.319,00:05:24.866,"Oh, I've been seasick in a boat before, but never air-sick!"
00:05:25.658,00:05:28.161,"Whoa, gale-force winds!"
00:05:28.244,00:05:29.746,That was fun!
00:05:35.543,00:05:37.253,"Hey, Alex, down here!"
00:05:37.337,00:05:38.421,-Huh? -Help. Help!
00:05:38.504,00:05:42.633,"The captain's boat is really fun, but it's not really a toy."
00:05:48.806,00:05:49.849,Ah! Oh!
00:05:49.932,00:05:51.059,Whoa!
00:05:52.894,00:05:54.312,"Hang on, Cap'n Turbot!"
00:06:04.697,00:06:06.949,Ah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:06:07.992,00:06:09.577,I'm thirsty.
00:06:14.248,00:06:15.500,"Oh, boy!"
00:06:15.583,00:06:19.128,We've never going to get him back up that beanstalk.
00:06:19.212,00:06:30.139,"And in commemoration of this special event, I've asked my deputy mayor, Chickaletta, to-- Where is that silly chicken? I asked her to be here."
00:06:32.809,00:06:33.976,Hi!
00:06:38.398,00:06:41.109,Yay! Hide and seek!
00:06:41.192,00:06:44.529,"Fee, fi, fo, fum!"
00:06:44.612,00:06:47.407,"Look out, Mayor Goodway! Here I come!"
00:06:51.619,00:06:52.870,"Hi, Mayor Goodway."
00:06:52.954,00:06:54.497,I know where Chickaletta is.
00:06:54.580,00:06:55.706,Let me help you.
00:07:05.383,00:07:07.260,"Thanks, Giant Alex!"
00:07:09.637,00:07:12.598,"Ryder, Alex is walking across Main Street."
00:07:14.976,00:07:15.893,Huh?
00:07:18.980,00:07:20.440,"Lemonade, yum!"
00:07:21.149,00:07:22.984,"Aw, empty!"
00:07:23.943,00:07:24.944,Look out!
00:07:31.033,00:07:32.160,Ladder!
00:07:41.586,00:07:42.420,"Hi, Alex."
00:07:43.588,00:07:46.174,"Alex, what are you doing way up there?"
00:07:50.386,00:07:51.512,Have a smoothie!
00:07:51.596,00:07:52.680,Mmm!
00:07:55.850,00:07:59.979,"Thanks, but I'm still kind of thirsty."
00:08:00.062,00:08:01.063,"Here, have another."
00:08:04.692,00:08:06.569,I'm still thirsty!
00:08:06.652,00:08:09.530,"I better make more, a lot more!"
00:08:09.614,00:08:13.159,"Yay, I love smoothies!"
00:08:13.242,00:08:17.038,I know how to get Alex up the beanstalk!
00:08:18.414,00:08:21.250,"Pups, we need fruit from Yumi's farm for the smoothies."
00:08:21.334,00:08:22.168,Lots of it!
00:08:22.251,00:08:24.462,"Rubble, Rocky, get what you can."
00:08:24.545,00:08:26.756,Rubble on the double!
00:08:30.426,00:08:34.931,"Marshall and Chase, I need the giant lemonade cup from the middle of Main Street."
00:08:35.014,00:08:36.224,Chase is on the case!
00:08:42.647,00:08:45.733,And my siren doesn't sound like that at all!
00:08:45.816,00:08:46.692,Whoa!
00:08:53.282,00:08:54.742,Sure hope this works.
00:08:54.825,00:08:56.327,"Go for it, Marshall!"
00:08:59.288,00:09:01.999,One giant-sized smoothie coming right up.
00:09:10.758,00:09:12.677,I had to use 12 blenders!
00:09:16.847,00:09:18.307,"Skye, you're on!"
00:09:26.274,00:09:27.817,Choo-choo!
00:09:27.900,00:09:31.862,"Whoa, Giant Alex, remember! The train's not a toy!"
00:09:35.700,00:09:39.120,How about a delicious berry smoothie?
00:09:41.539,00:09:43.291,"Mmm, yummy."
00:09:47.044,00:09:48.462,Can I have some?
00:09:48.546,00:09:51.841,"Can I just have one sip, please?"
00:10:25.833,00:10:27.752,That was delicious!
00:10:27.835,00:10:30.171,"And, pups, thanks for playing with me!"
00:10:32.089,00:10:36.927,"But next time you're thirsty, just ask for a smoothie and we'll bring you one to go!"
00:10:38.512,00:10:39.722,"Great job, pups!"
00:10:39.805,00:10:42.058,Giant Alex is back where he belongs.
00:10:46.729,00:10:47.605,Oh!
00:10:47.688,00:10:48.564,Huh?
00:10:49.148,00:10:50.816,"Oops, sorry, Rubble."
00:10:53.361,00:10:54.654,Wha-- What?
00:10:54.737,00:10:56.822,Where's Giant Alex?
00:10:56.906,00:10:58.366,He's right there.
00:10:58.449,00:11:02.161,"Fee, fi, fo, fum!"
00:11:02.244,00:11:05.665,I'm Giant Alex and here I come!
00:11:05.748,00:11:08.876,But he was a real giant!
00:11:10.503,00:11:11.420,"Ryder, Ryder!"
00:11:11.504,00:11:15.007,"There was a giant beanstalk, and Alex was a super-huge giant!"
00:11:15.091,00:11:17.093,And Turbot's boat was flying around!
00:11:17.176,00:11:23.265,"And you were there, and you were there! And, and-- Aw, I guess it was just a dream."
00:11:24.141,00:11:27.061,"No more cheese kibble before nap time for you, Rubble."
00:11:29.146,00:11:31.691,Glad everything's regular-sized now!
00:11:31.774,00:11:34.068,"-Fee, fi, fo, fum! -Don't worry, Rubble."
00:11:34.151,00:11:37.822,"If you ever have another giant dream, just snore for help."
00:00:56.973,00:01:01.019,Is the new and improved Pup Pup Boogie 2: Extra Dancing here yet?
00:01:01.102,00:01:03.396,I heard it was coming on the next train.
00:01:07.025,00:01:09.569,I'm playing the old Pup Pup Boogie.
00:01:41.935,00:01:43.728,"Whoa, nice moves, Skye."
00:01:47.982,00:01:51.319,"Skye, how can you do all those tough moves without messing up?"
00:01:51.402,00:01:52.779,I have a trick.
00:01:52.862,00:01:57.659,"When I learn a step for the first time, I say the moves out loud, like this."
00:02:20.223,00:02:21.724,Whee!
00:02:29.274,00:02:30.525,Whew!
00:02:30.608,00:02:32.152,I need a water break.
00:02:40.869,00:02:42.579,It's supposed to come later today.
00:02:44.289,00:02:47.500,I've been working on my tailspin. Watch.
00:02:47.584,00:02:49.252,Whoo-hoo!
00:02:54.424,00:02:56.134,"Nice catch, Ryder."
00:02:59.095,00:03:00.096,Ryder here.
00:03:03.516,00:03:07.020,A train car went off the tracks and bent some rails.
00:03:07.103,00:03:12.650,"Now today's train can't get into the station, and it's carrying a very important delivery."
00:03:12.734,00:03:14.277,I need help!
00:03:14.360,00:03:15.653,"Don't worry, Mayor Goodway."
00:03:15.737,00:03:19.240,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:03:21.159,00:03:22.160,Yahoo!
00:03:28.374,00:03:29.250,Race ya!
00:03:31.127,00:03:32.378,Wait a second.
00:03:37.800,00:03:41.638,And tailspin! Whee!
00:03:44.182,00:03:45.516,Wait for me!
00:04:02.825,00:04:04.911,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:04:04.994,00:04:08.206,"Pups, there's an emergency in Adventure Bay."
00:04:22.762,00:04:24.722,"Nice moves, Marshall."
00:04:24.806,00:04:28.518,A train car went off the tracks and bent up some of the rails.
00:04:28.601,00:04:33.189,We have to move the car and fix the tracks or the train can't come through Adventure Bay.
00:04:33.273,00:04:36.317,The all new Pup Pup Boogie 2 is coming on that train.
00:04:36.401,00:04:38.945,All new Pup Pup Boogie 2!
00:04:39.028,00:04:45.702,"I got to dance. I got to… stop doing that. Okay, I'm all done for real this time."
00:04:49.163,00:04:53.418,I'll need you to use your winch to pull that heavy train car off the tracks.
00:04:53.501,00:04:55.378,Chase is on the case!
00:04:57.672,00:05:02.010,"Rubble, I'll need you to dig up the bent track and bring in new rails."
00:05:02.093,00:05:04.345,Rubble on the double!
00:05:04.429,00:05:07.390,"All right, PAW Patrol is on a roll!"
00:06:17.168,00:06:18.544,This is a disaster!
00:06:18.628,00:06:20.129,The track's bent!
00:06:20.213,00:06:25.218,"This cargo car is too heavy to move, and the train's due in just a few hours."
00:06:28.679,00:06:34.977,"Chase, can you move the box car so we can repair the tracks -and let the train through? -Will do, Ryder, sir!"
00:06:43.319,00:06:44.654,"Attaboy, Chase."
00:06:46.030,00:06:46.948,Okay!
00:06:59.502,00:07:02.505,"Hmm, these rails are bent."
00:07:11.472,00:07:14.600,"Sure, I'm good. I'm great."
00:07:14.684,00:07:16.894,Youch! I'm hurt.
00:07:17.728,00:07:19.939,We better have Katie look at this paw.
00:07:20.440,00:07:23.192,I'll call the engineer and tell him to stop the train.
00:07:24.777,00:07:28.489,Hello? Hello? Hello?
00:07:32.827,00:07:33.744,How's Rubble?
00:07:34.745,00:07:36.289,His paw is sprained.
00:07:39.459,00:07:41.252,I can't stay off it.
00:07:41.335,00:07:43.421,I've got a train track to fix.
00:07:45.047,00:07:47.550,Someone else will have to drive your digger.
00:07:47.633,00:07:48.634,"You can, Ryder."
00:07:48.718,00:07:51.179,You're the one that taught me how to drive it!
00:07:51.262,00:07:54.974,I'm not sure I'm the right size for it.
00:07:55.057,00:07:56.809,But I'll give it a try.
00:08:00.688,00:08:02.231,"Ah, I don't fit."
00:08:02.315,00:08:03.608,Time for plan B.
00:08:03.691,00:08:05.067,What's plan B?
00:08:05.151,00:08:06.444,"You are, Chase."
00:08:07.195,00:08:08.154,Huh?
00:08:08.738,00:08:10.406,I don't know.
00:08:13.409,00:08:15.620,Don't worry. I'll talk you through it.
00:08:19.248,00:08:20.791,"Okay, it's simple."
00:08:24.754,00:08:26.172,That wasn't so hard.
00:08:26.255,00:08:27.173,What's next?
00:08:31.928,00:08:34.722,Bucket up button? Hit the gas?
00:08:34.805,00:08:36.140,"Oh, wait! The brakes!"
00:08:38.809,00:08:40.770,Easy! Too much gas!
00:08:40.853,00:08:43.064,"No, that's the drill arm!"
00:08:43.147,00:08:45.399,Huh? Where did this hill come from?
00:08:59.247,00:09:01.123,"Chase, are you okay?"
00:09:01.207,00:09:04.919,"Uh, I'm a little dizzy, but I'll be all right."
00:09:06.879,00:09:09.882,"Hmm, the train's getting closer to the station."
00:09:14.887,00:09:18.432,"Sorry, Ryder, I had trouble following the instructions."
00:09:18.516,00:09:20.643,Just like I did in Pup Pup Boogie.
00:09:28.276,00:09:31.028,First hit the square button on the left.
00:09:31.112,00:09:33.489,The square button? What's that?
00:09:39.412,00:09:43.416,"One, two, three, and left front paw, push lever."
00:09:43.499,00:09:45.293,"Left front paw, push lever."
00:09:45.376,00:09:47.003,"Right paw, push down."
00:09:58.764,00:10:00.308,"Left paw, black button."
00:10:02.602,00:10:04.186,"Oh, yeah, I got it."
00:10:10.610,00:10:14.447,"Perfect, now we just need to lay down the new rails."
00:10:18.993,00:10:21.287,"Phew, that's it!"
00:10:21.370,00:10:23.039,The track is fixed.
00:10:23.122,00:10:25.374,And just in time. The train's coming.
00:10:29.045,00:10:32.590,"Yoo-hoo! You fixed the track, Chase!"
00:10:32.673,00:10:36.761,"-What a good puppy! -Oh yeah, right there."
00:10:36.844,00:10:38.638,I knew the PAW Patrol could do it!
00:10:38.721,00:10:41.098,"Whenever you need us, just yelp for help!"
00:10:41.182,00:10:44.727,Special delivery for Mayor Goodway and the PAW Patrol!
00:10:44.810,00:10:47.855,Thank you and just in time!
00:10:47.938,00:10:50.983,"The new, improved Pup Pup Boogie 2!"
00:10:51.067,00:10:53.819,"Whoa, yeah, here we go, uh-huh!"
00:10:56.697,00:10:59.659,"Wow, whoo-hoo! Yeah!"
00:10:59.742,00:11:01.702,"Ryder, can I go play?"
00:11:01.786,00:11:04.080,"I mean, boogie with Skye?"
00:11:04.163,00:11:07.458,You sure can. You were awesome today.
00:11:07.541,00:11:08.959,What a good pup.
00:11:36.946,00:11:38.072,"Thanks, Mayor Goodway."
00:00:51.134,00:00:53.261,"Up and at 'em, every pup!"
00:01:07.150,00:01:09.736,"Pups, wake up!"
00:01:12.489,00:01:14.199,I can get them up.
00:01:15.033,00:01:17.452,Huh? Breakfast time already?
00:01:17.535,00:01:18.995,Why didn't you wake me up?
00:01:24.250,00:01:27.170,"Hey, Grandpa. When's the school bus going to get here?"
00:01:27.253,00:01:30.381,My new backpack's all ready and I have a tuna sandwich for lunch!
00:01:30.465,00:01:33.134,Sounds like you're ready for your first day of school.
00:01:33.218,00:01:35.804,Better grab your backpack. The bus will be here soon.
00:01:35.887,00:01:37.472,"Okay, Grandpa!"
00:01:38.181,00:01:43.478,"Hey… where did it go? Backpack, where did I leave you?"
00:01:44.354,00:01:45.855,Where could it be?
00:01:48.733,00:01:53.988,I can't go to my first day of school without my new backpack. I need help.
00:01:57.367,00:01:59.744,Downward dog.
00:02:02.288,00:02:04.165,"Now, upward dog."
00:02:10.547,00:02:11.798,"Hey, look."
00:02:11.881,00:02:14.342,Marshall's doing the snoring dog.
00:02:17.554,00:02:19.472,Time for the pups' breakfast.
00:02:23.476,00:02:26.813,"Ryder, this is the biggest emergency ever!"
00:02:28.148,00:02:32.694,My brand new red backpack is lost and today's my very first day of school.
00:02:32.777,00:02:35.488,Can the PAW Patrol help me? Please?
00:02:35.572,00:02:37.866,Don't worry. We'll find your backpack.
00:02:37.949,00:02:41.077,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:02:49.752,00:02:50.712,Whoa!
00:02:50.795,00:02:52.630,Whoa! Oh no!
00:02:53.882,00:02:55.300,Whoa!
00:02:55.383,00:02:57.969,"Marshall, you have a bowl on your head."
00:02:58.052,00:03:01.681,"Huh? Oh, my bowl. Are we still having breakfast?"
00:03:21.576,00:03:23.494,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:03:24.495,00:03:28.374,Thanks for getting here so early. We need to jump on this one fast.
00:03:31.252,00:03:32.712,…and on the first day of school.
00:03:32.795,00:03:34.881,"Aw, poor Alex."
00:03:34.964,00:03:38.218,We have to help him find it before the school bus comes to pick him up.
00:03:39.761,00:03:44.265,"Chase, I need your police pup skills to find clues to where Alex might have left it."
00:03:44.349,00:03:46.392,Chase is on the case.
00:03:47.894,00:03:51.898,"Skye, I need you to search from the air with your telescopic goggles."
00:03:54.359,00:03:56.736,This pup's gotta fly!
00:03:56.819,00:03:59.739,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:05:14.564,00:05:18.234,We've still got a little while before it gets to Alex's bus stop.
00:05:18.318,00:05:21.821,"Okay, Alex, when's the last time you remember seeing the backpack?"
00:05:22.947,00:05:28.911,"Yesterday. Grandpa packed it with a tuna sandwich and stuff, and we went to the park to feed Fuzzy."
00:05:29.954,00:05:31.831,Let's go check the park!
00:05:31.914,00:05:40.465,"And then we went to the beach and played in the water. And then… Ryder, you and I can't check all those places before the bus comes."
00:05:46.262,00:05:47.722,"Zuma, check the beach."
00:05:47.805,00:05:49.223,We're on our way!
00:05:56.105,00:05:59.359,"Hi, Fuzzy. Have you seen a red backpack around here?"
00:06:00.610,00:06:02.904,"Hey, there is something red in that tree."
00:06:13.790,00:06:16.959,"Oh, that's not a backpack. That's a balloon."
00:06:17.043,00:06:18.127,Let's keep looking.
00:06:20.380,00:06:21.214,There it is.
00:06:24.050,00:06:24.926,Huh?
00:06:27.261,00:06:29.555,"Come back here, you silly backpack."
00:06:33.476,00:06:35.228,"Wait, that's no backpack."
00:06:35.311,00:06:38.106,It's just an old life jacket. I'll take that for you.
00:06:41.025,00:06:41.984,"Thanks, dude."
00:06:52.662,00:06:55.415,"Ryder, the bus is getting closer."
00:06:59.919,00:07:04.298,Uh… yes. Grandpa and I got apples at Farmer Yumi's.
00:07:04.382,00:07:07.009,"And then, we had to make a delivery at City Hall."
00:07:09.846,00:07:12.473,Can you look for Alex's backpack at Farmer Yumi's?
00:07:12.557,00:07:14.559,And tell Rocky to check out City Hall.
00:07:20.565,00:07:26.320,"If were a backpack, I would be… There!"
00:07:32.326,00:07:35.371,"Aw, it's just one of Farmer Yumi's old bandannas."
00:07:48.759,00:07:50.845,I spy something red.
00:07:56.142,00:08:02.148,We are very proud to announce Adventure Bay is on solid ground-- Oh!
00:08:02.231,00:08:04.484,"Oh, whoopsies."
00:08:05.318,00:08:06.360,Oops.
00:08:16.370,00:08:19.582,"Ryder, the bus is heading down Alex's street."
00:08:19.665,00:08:21.083,We're going to have to hurry.
00:08:21.167,00:08:22.668,"Where else did you go, Alex?"
00:08:42.939,00:08:44.065,Great!
00:08:44.148,00:08:46.067,Let's grab it and get Alex to school!
00:08:47.985,00:08:50.071,"Ryder, it's moving."
00:08:52.657,00:08:55.284,Alex packed his lunch in there.
00:08:55.368,00:08:57.453,Guess who's having his tuna sandwich for breakfast.
00:08:58.454,00:09:01.207,Ah… ah… ah… choo!
00:09:01.290,00:09:02.208,Cali.
00:09:03.584,00:09:04.835,Oh no! Wait!
00:09:12.552,00:09:13.886,There goes the backpack.
00:09:18.349,00:09:21.352,We found Alex's backpack. Now we just have to catch it.
00:09:21.435,00:09:22.687,I'm on it.
00:09:30.361,00:09:32.780,"Okay, Skye, follow that train!"
00:09:32.863,00:09:35.074,Let's take to the sky!
00:09:40.454,00:09:43.541,I guess Ryder didn't find my backpack in time.
00:09:43.624,00:09:44.959,I guess not.
00:09:45.042,00:09:47.128,"I'm sorry I lost it, Grandpa."
00:09:47.211,00:09:50.881,I really wanted my new backpack for my first day of school.
00:10:01.851,00:10:05.896,"All right, Skye, just a little lower so I can grab it."
00:10:17.533,00:10:20.536,Got the backpack and Cali too!
00:10:20.620,00:10:22.747,"Now, let's catch that bus!"
00:10:30.212,00:10:31.714,"Time to go, Alex."
00:10:36.719,00:10:38.012,Mr. Porter!
00:10:38.095,00:10:39.555,Alex! Catch!
00:10:40.723,00:10:43.726,Yay! Ryder found my backpack!
00:10:47.688,00:10:49.231,"Thanks, Ryder!"
00:10:49.815,00:10:51.108,"You're welcome, Alex."
00:10:51.192,00:10:55.988,"Whenever you need us, just yelp for help… -See ya! Have fun! -Bye!"
00:10:58.574,00:11:01.661,Hey… somebody ate my sandwich.
00:11:07.833,00:11:10.086,"Enjoy your first day at school, Alex!"
00:11:12.088,00:11:16.467,You pups were really great today and you must be good and hungry.
00:11:21.764,00:11:23.057,-Hooray! -I'm starving!
00:11:27.812,00:11:29.647,"Well, look who it is."
00:11:29.730,00:11:32.316,"Don't worry, Cali. I didn't forget about you."
00:11:32.400,00:11:34.402,How about a tuna sandwich?
00:01:10.278,00:01:11.529,I need more cones.
00:01:21.623,00:01:22.457,I'm first.
00:01:22.540,00:01:23.750,Just barely.
00:01:26.252,00:01:28.171,The race is for fun.
00:01:28.254,00:01:31.132,Ryder's right. Race you back to get more?
00:01:31.216,00:01:32.926,"Oh, you're on."
00:01:41.226,00:01:43.978,Almost ready for my airborne view.
00:01:44.062,00:01:45.980,"Oh my, Ryder, aren't you coming?"
00:01:46.064,00:01:47.941,"I'll watch the finish line, Mayor."
00:01:48.024,00:01:50.819,Don't worry. The balloon is safely tethered to the ground.
00:01:50.902,00:01:56.616,"Oh, I'm not worried, as long you tied the line extra, extra tight."
00:01:57.242,00:01:58.118,Oh!
00:01:59.035,00:02:00.829,Oh!
00:02:00.912,00:02:04.332,"We do have a great view of the course from up here, don't we, Chickaletta?"
00:02:05.416,00:02:08.086,More cones! I need more cones!
00:02:08.169,00:02:11.339,Marshall zooms to the front and wins the race!
00:02:11.422,00:02:15.093,The crowd goes wild! Whoo-hoo!
00:02:15.176,00:02:17.804,"Sorry, dude. I'll be zooming past you."
00:02:22.433,00:02:24.310,Skye is gonna win.
00:02:24.394,00:02:26.938,She can just fly up and take a shortcut.
00:02:28.273,00:02:31.317,I have to follow the course just like all you pups.
00:02:36.239,00:02:37.198,Come on!
00:02:40.160,00:02:41.161,Whoa!
00:02:43.329,00:02:44.497,I'm okay.
00:02:45.832,00:02:47.125,Wait for me!
00:02:48.710,00:02:50.753,Here I come!
00:02:52.589,00:02:53.840,"Back up, pups."
00:03:23.119,00:03:25.496,I called you so we could review the race course.
00:03:25.580,00:03:27.540,The race starts at city hall.
00:03:27.624,00:03:36.883,"It goes around Mr. Porter's restaurant, up to Jake's Mountain, then past the Lookout, over the bridge, and across the finish line at city hall."
00:03:36.966,00:03:38.134,What a race!
00:03:40.511,00:03:42.889,Good luck. And may the fastest pup win.
00:03:42.972,00:03:43.848,That's me.
00:03:43.932,00:03:44.766,"-No, I am. -Yay!"
00:03:46.017,00:03:48.394,I'm going to win this race fair and square.
00:04:46.077,00:04:48.288,"Attention, racers!"
00:04:48.371,00:04:59.841,On your mark… get set… Wait! Wait for me!
00:05:01.342,00:05:02.635,Can I race too?
00:05:02.719,00:05:03.636,"Sorry, Alex."
00:05:03.720,00:05:07.307,But your trike is no match for our super fast trucks.
00:05:07.390,00:05:10.351,"Pups, don't forget this race is just for fun."
00:05:10.435,00:05:12.520,It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
00:05:12.603,00:05:13.730,"Go for it, Alex."
00:05:13.813,00:05:14.856,"Thanks, Ryder!"
00:05:14.939,00:05:22.113,"Okay, racers, on your mark, get set… …go!"
00:05:23.698,00:05:26.200,-And the race is underway! -Whoo!
00:05:34.959,00:05:36.544,Chase is on the case!
00:05:36.627,00:05:38.755,He's gonna win this race!
00:05:40.340,00:05:42.967,Marshall's in it to win it. Whoa!
00:05:43.718,00:05:44.927,Look out!
00:05:48.681,00:05:49.515,Ew.
00:05:51.017,00:05:52.769,"Mmm, delicious."
00:05:56.773,00:05:59.025,"Yes, Chickaletta, you can have a snack."
00:06:05.865,00:06:08.951,Watermelon break is over. The racers are back on course.
00:06:18.211,00:06:21.130,"Wow, it looks like Rubble's in the lead."
00:06:26.552,00:06:29.514,"Whoa, sorry, dudes. These cones are totally in the way."
00:06:33.518,00:06:36.104,Those are supposed to keep us from going down the hill.
00:06:38.689,00:06:39.690,Ah!
00:06:39.774,00:06:42.193,-Ah! -Ah!
00:06:45.905,00:06:48.282,Whoa! Awesome!
00:06:49.992,00:06:52.787,Sorry. I'm a little off course.
00:06:52.870,00:06:54.539,Whee!
00:06:54.622,00:06:57.250,"Took a wrong turn, just passing through."
00:06:57.333,00:06:59.544,We're really moving!
00:07:03.881,00:07:06.008,"Wow, too many trees!"
00:07:08.845,00:07:12.682,"The racers have hit a mountain of trouble, folks: Jake's Mountain."
00:07:16.602,00:07:18.604,Now Zuma is in the lead.
00:07:35.079,00:07:38.082,Marshall's in front as they race past the Lookout!
00:07:51.345,00:07:52.263,Cali!
00:08:11.949,00:08:14.285,Back in front! Yes!
00:08:15.369,00:08:16.537,Out of the way!
00:08:17.371,00:08:18.247,Huh?
00:08:18.331,00:08:21.542,"Alex, you're going the wrong way."
00:08:21.626,00:08:24.712,Wait. I'm going the wrong way.
00:08:24.795,00:08:27.507,Uh-oh. What happened?
00:08:31.594,00:08:33.513,Looks like Marshall's back on track.
00:08:38.226,00:08:40.686,"Attention, road hazard!"
00:08:49.445,00:08:54.033,"Wow, look at all the bubbles. Bye."
00:08:54.116,00:08:57.411,Our racers are headed for the finish line. Oh my!
00:08:59.872,00:09:01.749,"Ah, ah, ah!"
00:09:01.832,00:09:02.708,Help!
00:09:02.792,00:09:04.085,Oh no!
00:09:06.671,00:09:09.590,"Skye, the Mayor's balloon is loose! Hurry!"
00:09:09.674,00:09:11.259,On my way!
00:09:18.641,00:09:20.768,Race you to the soccer field!
00:09:26.732,00:09:31.445,"Hey, where'd everybody go? There's the finish line."
00:09:36.033,00:09:37.243,All set.
00:09:44.542,00:09:46.502,"Hang on, Mayor!"
00:09:49.171,00:09:51.507,This pup's got to fly!
00:09:51.591,00:09:52.758,"Thanks, Skye."
00:09:52.842,00:09:54.093,"Hi, Mayor Goodway."
00:09:56.762,00:09:59.890,"Okay, pups, we're coming in for a landing at the soccer field."
00:10:05.187,00:10:07.106,Grab a rope and pull.
00:10:12.486,00:10:15.031,"Please get us down safely! Please, please, please!"
00:10:15.698,00:10:18.284,"Mayor Goodway, we're safe on the ground."
00:10:19.785,00:10:21.495,"Oh, right."
00:10:21.579,00:10:22.997,"Chickaletta, we're safe!"
00:10:27.001,00:10:30.338,"Now, get back in the race, pups! It's not over yet!"
00:10:31.339,00:10:34.842,"You better hurry, pups. Alex is headed for the finish line."
00:11:01.869,00:11:03.329,Tight race!
00:11:08.501,00:11:09.502,Wow.
00:11:10.586,00:11:11.962,Who won? Who won?
00:11:12.046,00:11:14.757,I took a finish line photo. Look.
00:11:14.840,00:11:18.219,And the winner is Alex!
00:11:18.302,00:11:19.679,I did it!
00:11:22.223,00:11:23.724,"Way to go, Alex."
00:11:25.184,00:11:26.394,"Alex, you did it!"
00:11:26.477,00:11:27.728,Great job!
00:11:27.812,00:11:28.938,"Thanks, Grandpa."
00:11:32.191,00:11:33.984,But you're all winners today.
00:11:38.280,00:11:40.574,"Way to go, guys! Hooray!"
00:00:49.507,00:00:51.509,"Whoo-hoo! Go, Marshall!"
00:00:53.386,00:00:54.429,Whoa!
00:00:57.390,00:00:59.142,Marshall's really on a roll.
00:01:02.604,00:01:08.651,Nice move. I really think Marshall could win the Fastest Fire Pup trophy today.
00:01:08.735,00:01:11.404,I've been training for this all week.
00:01:22.999,00:01:24.501,No! Whoa!
00:01:25.794,00:01:28.338,"Okay, maybe not."
00:01:28.421,00:01:30.548,"Don't worry, Marshall. You can still do it."
00:01:42.227,00:01:45.021,Time's running out. Marshall better hurry.
00:01:45.730,00:01:48.233,Next up is the animal rescue.
00:01:50.151,00:01:50.985,Huh?
00:01:51.069,00:01:53.822,"It's time for your big rescue, Cali."
00:02:07.544,00:02:09.587,"I'm on my way, Cali."
00:02:12.006,00:02:12.841,Ladder up.
00:02:20.640,00:02:22.225,I broke the ladder.
00:02:24.602,00:02:26.479,"Almost got you, Cali."
00:02:26.563,00:02:29.649,Almost… Whoa!
00:02:32.902,00:02:34.279,"Sorry, Cali."
00:02:34.362,00:02:35.947,I kind of messed that up.
00:02:41.369,00:02:42.954,"Are you okay, Marshall?"
00:02:46.499,00:02:49.377,The only thing I'm good at breaking is ladders.
00:02:50.753,00:02:51.588,Hmm.
00:03:02.807,00:03:03.850,All right!
00:03:05.685,00:03:09.314,Wait for me. Ryder needs a-- Whoa! Whoa!
00:03:09.397,00:03:11.107,Whoa!
00:03:31.294,00:03:33.171,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:03:34.547,00:03:35.757,"Okay, PAW Patrol."
00:03:37.550,00:03:39.093,"Ready to help, Ryder."
00:03:39.177,00:03:43.431,"But Ryder, Marshall's about to win the Fastest Fire Pup trophy."
00:03:43.514,00:03:44.933,Everyone is waiting for him.
00:03:45.016,00:03:46.100,"Don't worry, Skye."
00:03:46.184,00:03:48.686,"This time, Marshall's the emergency."
00:03:48.770,00:03:50.104,He needs our help.
00:03:50.188,00:03:52.774,Huh? I'm the emergency?
00:03:53.691,00:03:58.279,Everyone is waiting at the park to watch you try and win the World's Fastest Fire Pup trophy.
00:03:58.363,00:04:00.448,"-Yeah! -Go, Marshall!"
00:04:00.531,00:04:04.494,We just want you to try your best and not worry about whether you break the record.
00:04:04.577,00:04:07.330,Try my best and forget about the rest.
00:04:07.413,00:04:08.539,I can do that.
00:04:10.166,00:04:14.629,"Rocky, I need you to find something in your recycling to fix Marshall's ladder."
00:04:14.712,00:04:17.131,"Don't lose it, reuse it."
00:04:19.050,00:04:22.845,"And Marshall, I need you and your fire gear ready to do your best."
00:04:22.929,00:04:24.389,Do you think you can do that?
00:04:24.472,00:04:25.848,"I don't know, Ryder."
00:04:25.932,00:04:28.393,I didn't do a very good job in training.
00:04:28.476,00:04:30.103,"We know you can do it, Marshall."
00:04:32.355,00:04:33.731,"-We're on it! -Go, Marshall!"
00:04:33.815,00:04:34.649,Yay!
00:04:36.401,00:04:39.362,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll.
00:04:54.335,00:04:55.795,Whoa!
00:05:25.825,00:05:30.330,"PAW Patrol, we're on a-- Oh, we're here."
00:05:34.792,00:05:38.838,I need to find something to fix Marshall's fire truck ladder.
00:05:38.921,00:05:41.883,Nope. Nope. Nope.
00:05:43.885,00:05:45.303,"What did you find, Rocky?"
00:05:45.386,00:05:46.888,This broom will work.
00:05:46.971,00:05:50.308,"I'll reuse the handle as rungs on your fire ladder, Marshall."
00:06:00.443,00:06:01.611,All done here.
00:06:01.694,00:06:03.029,"Great, Rocky."
00:06:10.370,00:06:14.916,"Hello, Adventure Bay is waiting to film him breaking the fastest fire pup record."
00:06:14.999,00:06:16.125,He's late.
00:06:21.214,00:06:22.715,Marshall's ready to go.
00:06:22.799,00:06:24.008,"Thanks, Ryder."
00:06:26.010,00:06:29.806,"Chase, we need to get Marshall to the starting line in a hurry."
00:06:50.910,00:06:53.955,My cones will stop traffic till Marshall gets through.
00:07:06.134,00:07:08.553,"-Woo-hoo! Yeah! -Yay, Marshall!"
00:07:08.636,00:07:10.972,-You can break the record. -Yeah!
00:07:13.641,00:07:16.102,"So, where's this record-breaking fire pup?"
00:07:21.649,00:07:23.151,I hope.
00:07:53.389,00:07:58.769,"in less than ten minutes, he'll be the fastest fire pup ever!"
00:08:00.313,00:08:01.355,"Go, Marshall!"
00:08:01.439,00:08:03.900,Ready. Set.
00:08:14.869,00:08:15.870,I'm good.
00:08:29.967,00:08:32.011,He's making pretty good time.
00:08:41.103,00:08:43.481,"-Yay! Hooray! -Go, Marshall!"
00:08:48.152,00:08:49.403,Six minutes left.
00:08:49.487,00:08:51.239,This fire is as good as out.
00:09:01.165,00:09:02.291,I did it.
00:09:05.378,00:09:08.381,Now I just have to get to the town hall and ring that bell.
00:09:08.464,00:09:10.174,"Do my best, forget the rest."
00:09:10.258,00:09:11.300,Oh no!
00:09:14.554,00:09:16.514,Fire! I'll take care of that.
00:09:24.063,00:09:26.023,That could have been a disaster.
00:09:26.107,00:09:28.317,"-Way to go, Marshall. -Thanks."
00:09:28.401,00:09:32.029,"Uh, but I guess there's no time to break the record now."
00:09:33.948,00:09:35.199,Give it your best.
00:09:35.283,00:09:36.617,"Yeah, go for it."
00:09:38.828,00:09:40.538,Do my best and forget the rest.
00:09:53.593,00:09:54.927,Marshall is inside.
00:09:57.638,00:09:59.015,How'd I do?
00:09:59.098,00:10:01.142,-Did he do it? -Did he break the record?
00:10:04.812,00:10:08.733,"Folks, I'm afraid Marshall is one minute late."
00:10:17.116,00:10:18.784,"Well, I did my best."
00:10:18.868,00:10:21.370,"Yes, you did do your best."
00:10:21.454,00:10:25.833,"You stopped to put out a real fire, even though it cost you the record."
00:10:26.500,00:10:30.546,That makes you an Adventure Bay hero.
00:10:33.090,00:10:36.344,But that trophy is for the fastest fire pup in the world.
00:10:36.427,00:10:38.220,Not anymore.
00:10:38.304,00:10:42.725,This trophy is for the greatest fire pup in the world.

00:02:34.112,00:02:35.321,Hello! Ryder here.
00:02:35.405,00:02:37.031,"Ryder, I need your help!"
00:02:37.115,00:02:39.534,"It's a super big, huge emergency!"
00:02:39.617,00:02:43.246,-What's wrong? -A whole barrel of peanuts is missing!
00:02:43.329,00:02:47.041,And I was going to make a fresh peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
00:02:47.125,00:02:49.335,"I'm not sure how we can help, Alex."
00:02:52.046,00:02:56.092,What? I already poured a whole glass of cold milk.
00:02:57.093,00:02:59.387,I have another call I have to answer.
00:03:03.224,00:03:08.688,"Ryder, Ellie the baby elephant got out of her boxcar, and ran off toward Adventure Bay."
00:03:08.771,00:03:13.651,"Her mama is very, very… Ai-yi-yi!"
00:03:13.735,00:03:17.071,Don't worry. Tell Eunice we'll find her baby.
00:03:17.155,00:03:19.616,"No job is too big, no pup is too small."
00:03:26.372,00:03:27.624,Ta-da!

00:04:08.665,00:04:14.254,"Okay, pups, Ellie the baby elephant ran away from the circus train. We have to find her."
00:04:15.797,00:04:18.925,"Chase, I need you and your megaphone to call Ellie."
00:04:23.596,00:04:25.890,"Rocky, Ellie loves peanuts."
00:04:25.974,00:04:29.143,Can you build something out of your recycling to help catch her?
00:04:29.227,00:04:31.688,"Don't lose it, reuse it!"
00:04:31.771,00:04:34.732,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:05:28.870,00:05:34.500,I'm sure I've got something That won't work.
00:05:34.625,00:05:36.127,"No, this won't work either."
00:05:36.210,00:05:38.004,A-ha! Perfect.
00:05:39.005,00:05:42.300,"And now, all I need is a bag of peanuts."
00:05:57.899,00:06:00.318,Ryder! Did you bring me peanut butter?
00:06:00.401,00:06:02.195,"Not this time, Alex."
00:06:02.278,00:06:05.156,We have to find Ellie the baby elephant first.
00:06:08.117,00:06:09.660,Sure looks like she was here.
00:06:12.455,00:06:14.165,Smells like it too.
00:06:15.416,00:06:16.584,Peanut-shell trail.
00:06:16.667,00:06:19.170,Good work! Follow the peanut shells.
00:06:25.009,00:06:27.762,Huh. The peanut trail ends here.
00:06:27.845,00:06:31.182,Oh! We've chased Ellie halfway across Adventure Bay.
00:06:32.392,00:06:36.229,Here comes the Rocky Elephant-Attracter Peanut Dispenser.
00:06:36.312,00:06:38.356,It can make a trail of peanuts.
00:06:38.439,00:06:39.732,Watch!
00:06:42.193,00:06:43.027,Ha-ha.

00:07:09.429,00:07:11.973,"Okay, now we've got a bigger problem."
00:07:12.056,00:07:13.975,"Chase, keep looking for Ellie."
00:07:14.058,00:07:17.395,"Rocky, we need your Elephant-Attracter to get Eunice somewhere safe."

00:07:59.312,00:08:01.439,This elephant does not have an appointment.
00:08:03.024,00:08:04.734,"Come and get them, Eunice. Peanuts!"
00:08:10.239,00:08:12.033,I knew the PAW Patrol could do it.
00:08:14.744,00:08:17.830,"Okay, Rocky, try to lead her to Farmer Yumi's barn."
00:08:18.581,00:08:19.499,I'll be ready.

00:09:21.435,00:09:23.396,Looks like Ellie broke this ladder.
00:09:23.479,00:09:27.441,Hmm… Or climbed it.
00:09:31.028,00:09:33.155,Just like she did in her circus act.
00:09:33.239,00:09:34.907,Ellie loves climbing things.
00:09:35.950,00:09:37.368,"Oh, no."
00:09:37.451,00:09:40.830,"She loves to jump, too. It's the best part of her act."
00:09:40.913,00:09:43.249,"But in the circus, she jumps on a trampoline!"
00:09:47.378,00:09:50.423,"Rocky, where's the mattress the pups were jumping on earlier?"
00:09:50.506,00:09:54.051,In the truck. Why trash them when you can stash them?
00:10:04.854,00:10:07.148,The air mattress is flat. I'll blow it up!
00:10:10.484,00:10:12.028,"Chase, your megaphone!"
00:10:14.655,00:10:23.205,"Ladies and gentlemen, in a few moments, the amazing Ellie will perform a daring feat."

00:10:38.596,00:10:41.641,Ellie the elephant's spectacular leap!
00:10:56.656,00:10:59.325,Aw. That's so sweet.
00:10:59.408,00:11:02.370,"Uh, I mean, another job well done."
00:11:06.999,00:11:11.045,"Thanks, Ryder. You and your pups saved my circus."
00:11:11.128,00:11:13.255,That's what we're here for.
00:11:13.339,00:11:15.591,"If you need us, just yelp for help."
00:11:19.178,00:11:20.012,Bye!

00:11:31.023,00:11:32.733,What a good bunch of pups.
00:00:47.714,00:00:50.425,Stand back. Pups at work!
00:00:50.508,00:00:51.801,A few more scoops!
00:00:53.970,00:00:55.472,Rubble's almost done.
00:00:55.555,00:00:58.641,"Then, you can play in the sandbox all you want."
00:00:58.725,00:00:59.976,This should do it!
00:01:00.560,00:01:02.687,All done! Anything else?
00:01:04.689,00:01:07.025,"Yeah, sandcastle!"
00:01:11.029,00:01:12.280,Aw!
00:01:12.363,00:01:19.287,But I could try something like… this!
00:01:22.415,00:01:23.875,"Thanks, Rubble!"
00:01:23.958,00:01:25.919,"Cool, let's play!"
00:01:26.002,00:01:27.212,I want to be Rubble!
00:01:27.295,00:01:30.006,"No, I want to be Rubble!"
00:01:32.884,00:01:34.844,That sand-bulldozer is amazing!
00:01:36.262,00:01:38.264,I'm a construction pup!
00:01:51.861,00:01:55.156,"You can't be hungry, Cali. You already ate all your snacks."
00:02:00.912,00:02:03.373,Grandma made these treats specially for the PAW Patrol.
00:02:04.958,00:02:07.669,You sure have a big appetite for such a little kitten.
00:02:09.254,00:02:10.839,"Wow, you really are hungry!"
00:02:25.395,00:02:27.147,Oh no!
00:02:29.315,00:02:30.692,Rockslide on the tracks!
00:02:30.775,00:02:33.778,We're stuck on the bridge till they can find someone who can clear it!
00:02:54.966,00:02:55.925,Whoa!
00:02:56.509,00:02:59.804,"Don't worry, Katie. The PAW Patrol is on the way!"
00:02:59.888,00:03:02.599,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:03:02.682,00:03:04.642,I got it! I got it!
00:03:14.694,00:03:16.738,That should not count as a goal.
00:03:26.789,00:03:28.124,Yeah!
00:03:29.751,00:03:30.877,I am first!
00:03:46.142,00:03:47.644,Told you I'd be first!
00:03:52.357,00:03:55.068,"PAW Patrol, ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:03:58.738,00:04:01.616,There's been a rockslide on the old trestle bridge.
00:04:01.699,00:04:03.451,Rocks have covered the tracks.
00:04:03.534,00:04:05.286,The train is trapped.
00:04:05.870,00:04:08.957,"Ryder, there's been a rockslide at the old trestle bridge."
00:04:11.251,00:04:12.377,"Don't worry, Skye."
00:04:15.338,00:04:19.634,"Rubble, I need you and your bulldozer to scoop the boulders off the tracks."
00:04:19.717,00:04:21.135,Let's dig it!
00:04:26.224,00:04:28.309,Green means go!
00:04:28.393,00:04:30.353,PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:05:56.064,00:05:58.149,"Cali, where are you going?"
00:06:03.988,00:06:05.782,The tracks are okay.
00:06:05.865,00:06:10.453,We just need to clear away the rocks fast and get the train off the bridge.
00:06:35.770,00:06:36.813,Huh?
00:07:07.176,00:07:09.637,"Rocky, a support beam is cracked!"
00:07:09.720,00:07:10.847,"Hang on, Ryder!"
00:07:12.265,00:07:13.808,I can't hear you!
00:07:14.976,00:07:16.477,The trestle is cracked!
00:07:16.561,00:07:18.980,"If it breaks, the train will fall."
00:07:21.149,00:07:23.234,"Hmm, I've got it!"
00:07:27.530,00:07:29.115,I won't be able to!
00:07:29.198,00:07:31.492,"My truck can't make it down there, Ryder."
00:07:31.576,00:07:33.077,Too steep!
00:07:33.744,00:07:35.746,We need an extra set of paws.
00:07:37.373,00:07:41.210,"Chase, I need you and your truck at the bridge as soon as possible!"
00:07:41.294,00:07:42.628,Chase is on the case!
00:07:49.218,00:07:50.136,Huh?
00:08:06.444,00:08:08.779,We'll use it to hold up the broken beam.
00:08:16.412,00:08:17.246,Perfect!
00:08:17.330,00:08:18.706,Let's go!
00:08:31.802,00:08:33.471,Just a little lower.
00:08:42.813,00:08:43.731,Right there!
00:08:46.317,00:08:47.485,How's it look?
00:08:47.568,00:08:50.780,Looks great! That'll hold until we get the train off the bridge.
00:08:50.863,00:08:53.241,"All the rocks are cleared up here, Ryder!"
00:08:55.826,00:08:58.746,"Katie, tell the engineer that the tracks are clear."
00:08:58.829,00:09:00.748,Let's get this train off the bridge!
00:09:00.831,00:09:03.084,"I will, Ryder, but I'm worried."
00:09:03.167,00:09:04.252,Worried?
00:09:04.335,00:09:05.753,Cali's missing!
00:09:13.844,00:09:16.889,Whoa!
00:09:21.686,00:09:22.853,Did you hear that?
00:09:22.937,00:09:26.399,"It's Cali! Chase, can you-- Chase is on the case!"
00:09:38.619,00:09:41.372,"Cali, am I glad to see you!"
00:09:48.462,00:09:49.839,…nothing.
00:09:54.760,00:09:58.556,"I knew Ryder and the PAW Patrol could do it, but where's Cali?"
00:10:00.308,00:10:02.310,"Cali, you naughty kitten!"
00:10:13.070,00:10:15.156,-Yes! -We did it!
00:10:19.577,00:10:21.704,"Thanks, Ryder! Thanks, PAW Patrol!"
00:10:21.787,00:10:23.497,You were awesome!
00:10:37.970,00:10:39.513,-Huh? -Nice try.
00:10:44.810,00:10:45.728,Huh?
00:10:54.779,00:10:58.032,"After that rescue, you really deserve playtime."
00:01:08.109,00:01:12.030,"Uh, next time, I'll spare you the wipe-out."
00:01:14.407,00:01:16.242,"Okay, okay, let's go."
00:01:33.176,00:01:36.346,"PAW Patrol, ready for-- Psst. Psst."
00:01:38.139,00:01:38.973,Huh?
00:01:42.936,00:01:45.438,"PAW Patrol, ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:01:45.522,00:01:49.192,Strange things are happening at Cap'n Turbot's Halloween party.
00:01:50.568,00:01:53.488,The sails mysteriously raised on the ghost ship.
00:01:56.866,00:01:58.660,That's too spooky.
00:01:58.743,00:02:03.289,Cap'n Turbot lost his glasses and can't see well enough to sail the ship back.
00:02:03.373,00:02:05.458,Now everyone is trapped on board.
00:02:05.542,00:02:07.710,Are real ghosts on that ship?
00:02:11.798,00:02:15.385,"Zuma, I'll need you and your hovercraft to catch up with the runaway ship."
00:02:15.468,00:02:16.970,Let's dive in.
00:02:18.054,00:02:21.391,"Skye, I'll need you and your helicopter to help slow it down."
00:02:29.732,00:02:33.069,"Ready for a ruff, ruff rescue."
00:02:33.153,00:02:36.114,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:03:23.328,00:03:24.287,Whoa!
00:03:28.875,00:03:30.210,Whoa!
00:03:49.562,00:03:50.772,Whoa!
00:03:56.819,00:03:59.030,My purse! Chickaletta!
00:03:59.113,00:04:00.240,I'll get her!
00:04:00.823,00:04:01.950,Whoa!
00:04:05.078,00:04:06.579,Here I come.
00:04:06.663,00:04:07.956,Whoa!
00:04:08.539,00:04:11.918,Ooh! Ooh! Whoa! I'm going to whoopsie.
00:04:12.001,00:04:13.419,Whee!
00:04:14.003,00:04:19.259,"Oh, thank you, Alex. You rescued Chickaletta."
00:04:21.803,00:04:25.348,Chickaletta? Where's my darling little purse chicken?
00:04:40.363,00:04:46.286,"Skye, you and Marshall have to slow the ghost ship down so Zuma and I can get on board."
00:04:46.369,00:04:48.746,Can you get close enough to lower the sails?
00:04:48.830,00:04:50.707,I'll try my best.
00:04:52.292,00:04:53.459,They might hit the mast!
00:04:56.296,00:04:57.755,Whoa!
00:05:01.175,00:05:03.678,This pumpkin's going to the patch.
00:05:05.138,00:05:06.639,She did it!
00:05:08.766,00:05:10.643,-Whoo! -Hoorah!
00:05:14.981,00:05:17.442,-Yay! Skye and Marshall! -Yay! Whoo-hoo!
00:05:17.525,00:05:18.609,You did it!
00:05:18.693,00:05:21.112,One sail down and one to go!
00:05:37.128,00:05:38.921,ATV on autopilot.
00:05:40.340,00:05:42.425,Let's get on board and get the other sail down.
00:05:51.100,00:05:52.185,Hurry!
00:05:54.562,00:05:58.066,Come on! You got it! Jump!
00:06:10.870,00:06:12.246,Nice catch.
00:06:12.330,00:06:13.498,Nice jump.
00:06:15.124,00:06:18.169,Something super spooky's going on up there.
00:06:18.252,00:06:19.545,Let's go find out.
00:06:25.635,00:06:28.971,Can the sails just raise all by themselves somehow?
00:06:29.055,00:06:32.725,Nope. Nothing's automatic on this old ship. Somebody must have done it.
00:06:35.478,00:06:40.066,So ghosts must have done it. That is so cool.
00:06:40.149,00:06:43.861,There's got to be some simple explanation for all this.
00:06:43.945,00:06:45.405,Like what?
00:06:51.411,00:06:53.871,"If it is a ghost, he can't steer."
00:06:53.955,00:06:57.583,"Well, all I know is we need to get this ship back to shore."
00:06:57.667,00:06:59.710,Let's check out the steering wheel.
00:07:02.755,00:07:04.590,Marshall? Zuma?
00:07:12.306,00:07:15.476,Something must be wrong with that steering wheel.
00:07:16.644,00:07:18.813,"Uh, sorry."
00:07:22.859,00:07:25.027,So that's who's been steering!
00:07:44.672,00:07:45.882,"And thank you, pups."
00:07:48.134,00:07:50.887,"Actually, Chickaletta was the ghost."
00:07:50.970,00:07:52.972,She was moving the steering wheel.
00:07:53.055,00:07:57.894,"Oh, who's a natural born leader just like her mommy?"
00:08:02.732,00:08:05.234,"Well, that's definitely not Chickaletta."
00:08:09.989,00:08:11.157,Help. Help. Help.
00:08:19.832,00:08:22.835,I'm guessing our ghost is behind these barrels.
00:08:25.379,00:08:27.298,"No, Ryder, don't!"
00:08:42.021,00:08:44.148,"Ryder, be careful."
00:08:45.775,00:08:49.237,"Okay, everyone, here's your ghost."
00:08:54.992,00:08:56.369,Whoo!
00:08:56.452,00:09:00.623,"Wally's snores echoed behind the barrels, making that spooky sound."
00:09:03.793,00:09:06.379,And it was Wally who ate all the cookies.
00:09:31.320,00:09:34.448,"Whoa, the sails again. That's got to be a ghost."
00:09:34.532,00:09:36.325,Or a sneaky cat.
00:09:38.244,00:09:40.955,"Cali, you silly kitty."
00:09:44.417,00:09:46.335,Mystery solved.
00:09:46.419,00:09:48.588,Chickaletta was our secret captain.
00:09:48.671,00:09:52.550,Wally the walrus made those ghostly sounds.
00:09:52.633,00:09:54.552,And Cali raised the sails.
00:09:54.635,00:09:57.555,"Wow. Great detective work, Ryder."
00:09:57.638,00:09:59.223,"Thanks, Mr. Porter."
00:09:59.307,00:10:03.060,"Now, if you could just find my glasses."
00:10:07.315,00:10:09.525,Yes! How did they get there?
00:10:09.609,00:10:11.819,"Ryder, you're a genius."
00:10:12.320,00:10:19.952,"Ryder, thank you so much for rescuing us, and Chickaletta from those, well, whatever they were."
00:10:23.956,00:10:28.377,Let's get this boat back to the dock so we can have a real Halloween party.
00:10:29.670,00:10:32.298,It's Halloween party time!
00:10:37.345,00:10:41.057,"Now that we're safely docked, let's get this ghost ship party started."
00:10:48.981,00:10:50.858,That did not sound good.
00:10:55.946,00:10:58.949,I bet you it's the real ghosts this time.
00:10:59.033,00:11:03.037,Chickaletta's feeling a little bit too seasick for a ghost ship party.
00:11:03.120,00:11:04.163,So is Cali.
00:11:04.246,00:11:05.915,Wait. I want to see the ghost.
00:11:05.998,00:11:07.667,"I think you're too seasick, Alex."
00:11:11.420,00:11:12.463,-Ah! -Ah!
00:11:19.512,00:11:20.805,Spooky.
00:11:21.430,00:11:22.765,"What do you think, Ryder?"
00:11:22.848,00:11:26.977,I think this is the most mysterious Halloween party I've ever been to.
00:11:29.271,00:11:30.690,What are we going to do?
00:11:33.526,00:11:35.236,-Great idea! -Party time!
00:11:59.927,00:12:02.596,I'm a princess. Where's my Prince Charming?
00:12:21.574,00:12:22.491,Huh?
00:12:27.413,00:12:30.499,"Whoa, a flying ghost ship."
00:12:30.583,00:12:33.085,This is the greatest Halloween ever.
00:12:33.169,00:12:36.005,You have to believe in ghosts now.
00:12:36.839,00:12:39.592,I'm sure there's a simple explanation.
00:12:39.675,00:12:44.221,I just have no idea what it could be. Happy Halloween.
00:00:58.558,00:00:59.934,"Nice run, Rubble."
00:01:03.438,00:01:04.272,Uh-oh!
00:01:04.355,00:01:05.315,Look out!
00:01:11.988,00:01:13.323,Almost done.
00:01:16.409,00:01:18.244,"Ooh, nice touch, Rocky."
00:01:18.328,00:01:20.872,-Great snowman! -Wow!
00:01:25.668,00:01:27.003,"Hey, Ryder, let's go!"
00:01:28.379,00:01:31.091,Adventure Bay Snow Day won't last all day.
00:01:31.174,00:01:36.888,"Well, okay, it will last all day, but I don't want to miss a second."
00:01:43.686,00:01:45.688,Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
00:01:48.817,00:01:53.029,There's no such thing as a snow monster! You don't have to leave!
00:01:53.113,00:01:56.032,Look! I took pictures of the monster tracks.
00:01:57.117,00:01:58.952,Yikes! What is that thing?
00:01:59.035,00:02:02.247,"But, dude… And I got a monster video too!"
00:02:06.000,00:02:07.418,"Hey, what's that?"
00:02:09.629,00:02:14.050,Adventure Bay snow monster!
00:02:14.134,00:02:15.844,"Whoa, little dude."
00:02:15.927,00:02:19.722,That is some kind of seriously strange strangeness.
00:02:19.806,00:02:22.100,It was so spooky.
00:02:22.183,00:02:25.019,I never saw a real snow monster before.
00:02:31.693,00:02:33.111,"Bad news, dude."
00:02:33.194,00:02:35.905,We're going to have to cancel Adventure Bay Snow Day.
00:02:35.989,00:02:37.490,-What? -Why?
00:02:41.786,00:02:43.746,Now everyone is totally spooked.
00:02:43.830,00:02:45.957,The Adventure Bay snow monster?
00:02:46.040,00:02:47.417,That's just an old story.
00:02:47.500,00:02:49.169,"Yeah, I know."
00:02:49.252,00:02:56.801,"But if we don't find whatever people think is this monster, dude, I'll have to close the slopes for the winter or maybe, like, forever."
00:02:58.761,00:03:00.805,I'm sure there's a simple explanation.
00:03:00.889,00:03:03.016,The PAW Patrol will come and figure it out.
00:03:07.896,00:03:10.607,Whoa! Whoa!
00:03:21.451,00:03:22.702,…go!
00:03:29.834,00:03:31.502,"Marshall, look out!"
00:03:31.586,00:03:32.587,Whoa!
00:04:02.867,00:04:06.162,Skiers are leaving because they thought they saw a snow monster.
00:04:06.246,00:04:08.164,Alex even got it on video.
00:04:15.463,00:04:17.423,A real snow monster?
00:04:17.507,00:04:18.883,Those are just stories.
00:04:18.967,00:04:20.343,But we just saw it.
00:04:20.426,00:04:26.266,"Of course we know snow monsters aren't real, so we have to figure out what Alex recorded on his phone."
00:04:27.267,00:04:31.521,"Chase, I need your nose and your net to catch whatever is making those tracks."
00:04:31.604,00:04:33.773,Chase is on the case!
00:04:35.858,00:04:43.783,"Rubble, I need you and your bulldozer, in case we need to move some snow and I might need you to snowboard down to help look for tracks."
00:04:43.866,00:04:46.452,Whoo-hoo! Snowboard time!
00:04:47.662,00:04:49.747,"I mean, Rubble on the double!"
00:06:20.505,00:06:22.173,Let me clear a path.
00:06:37.105,00:06:40.566,Ski season would be a bummer with no skiers.
00:06:40.650,00:06:42.276,We'll figure this mystery out.
00:06:42.360,00:06:44.487,"So, where did you see the tracks?"
00:06:44.570,00:06:47.240,At the bottom of that slope.
00:06:48.032,00:06:49.325,Let's take a look.
00:06:55.581,00:07:00.002,Don't worry. We'll solve the mystery and get the slopes full of snowboarders again.
00:07:04.882,00:07:06.134,Yeah!
00:07:07.927,00:07:09.095,Whoa!
00:07:12.598,00:07:14.016,Here are some tracks!
00:07:24.986,00:07:30.575,"Rubble, they're aren't any-- What? There aren't any what?"
00:07:30.658,00:07:34.495,Snow monsters. Let's find out what's really going on.
00:07:34.579,00:07:36.122,"Chase, sniff it out."
00:07:36.205,00:07:37.540,"I'm on it, Ryder."
00:07:48.259,00:07:56.058,Something's making me… …sneezy.
00:07:58.436,00:08:00.188,"Ah, thanks for getting me out."
00:08:02.857,00:08:04.567,The monster went this way.
00:08:07.987,00:08:09.739,"Okay, let's go."
00:08:09.822,00:08:10.740,Home?
00:08:10.823,00:08:12.408,"Come on, Rubble."
00:08:13.075,00:08:15.077,"Sure, no problem."
00:08:20.958,00:08:23.920,Looks like our mystery creature likes berries.
00:08:27.048,00:08:28.049,Rubble?
00:08:35.431,00:08:39.894,"I'm, uh, standing lookout, in case something… comes out of the bushes."
00:08:39.977,00:08:45.942,I can't believe you're scared of a-- Whoa!
00:08:47.693,00:08:50.613,"Pups, you're not afraid of a little noise, are you?"
00:08:56.035,00:08:58.704,It's close. Really close.
00:09:09.423,00:09:10.383,Gotcha!
00:09:17.890,00:09:19.225,He was right there.
00:09:26.399,00:09:29.443,There it is! We found the monster!
00:09:29.527,00:09:33.114,Huh? Now that's a snow monster.
00:09:35.116,00:09:38.119,That's no monster! It's a moo-ster.
00:09:40.913,00:09:46.419,The snow monster is Farmer Yumi's cow and goat and Mayor Goodway's chicken.
00:09:46.502,00:09:48.004,They were after the berries!
00:09:48.087,00:09:52.300,It made those strange tracks because Bettina's wearing boots.
00:09:57.638,00:10:00.099,Hmph! I knew that's what it was.
00:10:01.017,00:10:03.603,"Come on, monster. Let's get you home."
00:10:04.437,00:10:05.563,Uh-oh.
00:10:08.524,00:10:10.109,"Come back, Bettina!"
00:10:10.192,00:10:12.403,And that's the sound they make together.
00:10:13.946,00:10:17.116,"Well, Jake, here's your snow monster."
00:10:21.454,00:10:24.707,We told you there was a logical explanation.
00:10:29.128,00:10:31.005,You found Garbi and Bettina.
00:10:31.088,00:10:33.132,"Chickaletta, you naughty chicken."
00:10:33.215,00:10:35.468,I was so worried.
00:10:39.055,00:10:41.724,how did you get those old boots stuck on your feet?
00:10:41.807,00:10:43.059,Thanks for finding them.
00:10:46.103,00:10:48.773,"All right, Jake, you can open up the slopes now."
00:10:58.491,00:11:01.160,You deserve some serious snow day fun.
00:11:06.540,00:11:07.583,Yay!
00:11:19.053,00:11:20.179,Whoo! Yeah!
00:11:31.315,00:11:32.191,Uh-oh!
00:00:49.215,00:00:52.886,Rubble will now perform his amazing skateboard jump!
00:00:53.386,00:00:55.263,Hup! Wah-hoo!
00:00:57.307,00:00:58.183,Ta-da!
00:01:02.395,00:01:03.438,Ta-da!
00:01:11.946,00:01:14.115,Wait! Don't forget the grand finale.
00:01:16.326,00:01:17.368,Whoa!
00:01:17.452,00:01:18.578,Whoa!
00:01:19.788,00:01:20.789,Hop!
00:01:21.706,00:01:23.458,"Hey, I did it!"
00:01:24.209,00:01:25.293,Whoa!
00:01:25.418,00:01:26.461,"Whoa, whoa!"
00:01:28.379,00:01:30.757,"Nobody does a clown fall like you, Marshall."
00:01:42.560,00:01:44.813,"Hi, Raimundo! Is the circus here?"
00:01:44.896,00:01:47.524,The pups are super excited. So am I!
00:01:47.607,00:01:49.776,"Ryder, I have a big problem."
00:01:49.859,00:01:54.322,"Only one of the circus trains has arrived, and I don't have anyone to help set up the big top."
00:01:57.033,00:01:58.993,Don't worry. The pups and I will help.
00:02:06.084,00:02:08.128,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:02:13.091,00:02:13.925,Coming.
00:02:14.509,00:02:15.677,Whoa!
00:02:20.682,00:02:21.891,Made it!
00:02:38.533,00:02:40.451,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:02:41.786,00:02:43.913,"Thanks for coming so quickly, pups."
00:02:43.997,00:02:45.832,There's a problem with the circus.
00:02:45.915,00:02:47.458,Isn't it coming?
00:02:47.542,00:02:49.502,Only half the circus made it.
00:02:49.586,00:02:53.006,The performers and most of the animals are stuck on a broken train.
00:02:53.089,00:02:57.510,Raimundo needs our help setting up the circus while the train gets repaired.
00:02:59.095,00:03:03.099,"Chase, I need you and your winch to lift the big top into place."
00:03:03.183,00:03:05.894,"Rocky, I need your forklift to set up the stands."
00:03:05.977,00:03:10.732,"And Skye, I need you to fly up and place the circus flag at the tippy-top of the big top."
00:03:13.401,00:03:15.069,Green means go!
00:03:20.200,00:03:23.995,"Rubble, I need you to drill some holes for the tent's big poles."
00:03:27.498,00:03:30.627,"And Zuma, I need you to help set up the tumbling equipment."
00:03:30.710,00:03:32.962,Rubble on the double!
00:03:33.046,00:03:34.505,I'm fired up!
00:03:34.589,00:03:36.132,Let's dive in!
00:03:36.216,00:03:39.177,"All right, PAW Patrol is on a roll!"
00:04:46.411,00:04:51.249,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, and pups of all ages!"
00:04:51.332,00:04:54.711,The circus setup is about to begin!
00:05:04.387,00:05:06.472,"Okay, pups, on three!"
00:05:06.556,00:05:08.808,"One, two, three!"
00:05:13.354,00:05:14.731,"How's that, Ryder?"
00:05:16.899,00:05:18.318,Here are the poles!
00:05:20.361,00:05:21.863,And here are the holes!
00:05:21.946,00:05:23.698,"Chase, your winch hook!"
00:05:30.204,00:05:32.874,"Okay, Chase, lift the big top!"
00:05:32.957,00:05:34.334,Here it goes!
00:05:38.504,00:05:41.549,Perfect! All it needs is the flag!
00:05:41.632,00:05:43.343,We've got that covered.
00:05:47.597,00:05:50.141,This pup's got to fly!
00:06:00.401,00:06:02.612,We did it! The big top is up!
00:06:12.872,00:06:15.375,Got it! The trapeze is in place.
00:06:19.629,00:06:20.922,Me too!
00:06:21.506,00:06:23.257,Whoa!
00:06:28.471,00:06:34.268,"I know, but every time one of us lands… The other one totally flies back into the air!"
00:06:34.352,00:06:35.645,"Hang on, Zuma!"
00:06:39.315,00:06:40.441,"Yeah, thanks."
00:06:40.525,00:06:42.944,That spinning was making me dizzy!
00:06:48.199,00:06:49.867,"Hola, Leo, what's up?"
00:06:56.124,00:06:58.167,"Ay ay ay, it's not that bad."
00:06:59.877,00:07:01.671,"Everything okay, Raimundo?"
00:07:01.754,00:07:02.672,It's Leo.
00:07:02.755,00:07:05.842,He's upset at how long the repairs are taking on the second train.
00:07:05.925,00:07:07.885,Lions are very excitable.
00:07:07.969,00:07:10.096,"Breathe, Leo, breathe!"
00:07:10.680,00:07:13.141,"Ugh, I hope they get it fixed soon."
00:07:13.224,00:07:15.101,People are already lined up.
00:07:30.032,00:07:33.619,Most of our circus animals and performers aren't here tonight.
00:07:36.873,00:07:38.416,No circus?
00:07:38.499,00:07:39.417,Aw.
00:07:39.500,00:07:40.877,But I love the circus!
00:07:46.799,00:07:49.218,"Ladies and gentlemen, don't worry!"
00:07:49.302,00:07:50.970,The show will go on!
00:07:51.053,00:07:54.140,There's a group here already with talents that will amaze you.
00:07:56.476,00:07:58.311,"Yay, who is it?"
00:07:58.394,00:07:59.687,It's the PAW Patrol!
00:07:59.770,00:08:01.522,They'll perform in the circus.
00:08:01.606,00:08:02.773,Us?
00:08:06.027,00:08:07.069,Whoa!
00:08:12.074,00:08:14.952,Marshall the Magnificent Clown!
00:08:21.751,00:08:22.710,Let's do it!
00:08:22.793,00:08:24.295,"-You bet! -Yeah, all right!"
00:08:24.378,00:08:26.297,PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:08:29.133,00:08:35.139,"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you a very special treat."
00:08:35.223,00:08:37.433,A guest ringmaster!
00:08:37.517,00:08:39.185,"Thank you, Raimundo!"
00:08:39.268,00:08:44.857,"We have a very special show today, our very own Circus Pup Extravaganza!"
00:09:01.874,00:09:02.917,Whoa!
00:09:11.509,00:09:12.927,Whoo-hoo!
00:09:19.517,00:09:22.270,"My house! My house! Oh, it's one fire!"
00:09:22.353,00:09:23.813,I'll put it out!
00:09:29.986,00:09:31.571,No!
00:09:35.032,00:09:35.992,Uh-oh.
00:09:38.828,00:09:39.996,Whoa!
00:09:50.047,00:09:50.923,Huh?
00:09:52.508,00:09:53.634,Aha!
00:10:00.182,00:10:01.642,Whee!
00:10:03.185,00:10:04.395,Whoo-hoo!
00:10:06.522,00:10:07.982,Amazing!
00:10:13.779,00:10:16.949,"And now, the grande finale!"
00:10:31.339,00:10:32.632,"Hup, hup, hup!"
00:10:33.924,00:10:35.051,Ta-da!
00:10:42.433,00:10:52.485,"Ladies and gentlemen, let's have a round of applause for Eunice, Ellie, Ryder, and the PAW Patrol!"
00:10:53.069,00:10:55.863,Thank you! Thank you very much!
00:10:57.406,00:10:59.241,I have a special announcement.
00:11:04.455,00:11:08.501,"Ryder, I must thank you and the PAW Patrol for saving the circus."
00:11:08.584,00:11:09.585,It was fun.
00:11:09.669,00:11:12.338,"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!"
00:11:18.302,00:11:20.262,You put on an amazing show.
00:11:20.346,00:11:22.223,You sure are good pups!
00:11:22.973,00:11:25.184,"Okay, team, let's head home!"
00:11:28.396,00:11:29.563,Yay!
00:11:36.028,00:11:37.238,"Thank you, Ryder!"
00:00:53.219,00:00:54.637,"Thanks, Chase."
00:01:00.393,00:01:02.771,My apples are as sweet as can be.
00:01:05.565,00:01:08.151,"I love, love, love apples, Farmer Yumi."
00:01:08.234,00:01:10.028,Don't forget our pumpkins!
00:01:10.111,00:01:12.614,"I love, love, love pumpkins too!"
00:01:12.697,00:01:14.157,Especially in pies.
00:01:18.620,00:01:20.580,I can't reach any more branches.
00:01:20.663,00:01:24.042,I can reach those branches easy. Watch!
00:01:29.672,00:01:33.051,"But, Marshall, those are too… Uh-oh."
00:01:34.302,00:01:35.678,…sproingy.
00:01:35.762,00:01:37.263,Whoa!
00:01:43.853,00:01:44.896,Huh?
00:01:45.688,00:01:46.648,I'm okay!
00:01:53.655,00:01:54.948,Oh no!
00:01:55.031,00:01:57.283,I'm sorry. I'll clean it all up!
00:01:57.367,00:01:58.785,"No, no, Marshall."
00:01:58.868,00:02:00.453,"Pumpkin goop, I can handle."
00:02:00.537,00:02:03.248,It's the way Bettina's acting that has me worried.
00:02:12.340,00:02:14.259,Yep. Snow's coming.
00:02:14.342,00:02:16.177,Cows always know.
00:02:16.261,00:02:18.346,There's a snowstorm coming?
00:02:18.429,00:02:19.681,It's not even winter yet!
00:02:23.935,00:02:25.687,"Oh, peach fuzz!"
00:02:25.770,00:02:28.690,Then we have to pick everything before the storm gets here!
00:02:34.696,00:02:36.239,This is terrible!
00:02:39.117,00:02:41.619,"Yeah, let's go, go, go!"
00:02:52.255,00:02:53.131,Ugh!
00:02:57.051,00:02:57.886,Ryder!
00:02:57.969,00:02:59.554,"What's up, pups?"
00:03:01.264,00:03:02.765,A snowstorm is blowing in!
00:03:02.849,00:03:07.604,She has to pick all of her fruit by tonight or the Fall Festival will be ruined!
00:03:13.193,00:03:15.111,PAW Patrol to the Lookout!
00:03:21.784,00:03:22.785,You're it!
00:03:27.415,00:03:29.209,Last one to the Lookout is it!
00:03:34.881,00:03:36.174,It's Ryder!
00:03:36.257,00:03:37.258,Race ya!
00:03:41.763,00:03:43.598,Toy box!
00:03:43.681,00:03:47.018,Here comes Rubble on the double!
00:03:47.602,00:03:49.354,That's not fair!
00:03:55.902,00:03:57.237,I win!
00:03:58.154,00:03:59.864,I win.
00:04:13.294,00:04:15.880,"PAW Patrol ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:04:15.964,00:04:19.342,"Thanks for hustling, Pups. Farmer Yumi needs our help!"
00:04:20.468,00:04:22.220,A snowstorm is coming.
00:04:22.303,00:04:26.224,"If the orchard freezes, all the fruit on the trees will be ruined."
00:04:26.307,00:04:29.811,Wow. Farmer Yumi really needs our help.
00:04:29.894,00:04:32.397,"Yeah, she's counting on us."
00:04:32.480,00:04:36.359,"Marshall, we need you and your ladder to reach the fruit in the high branches."
00:04:36.442,00:04:37.902,I'm fired up!
00:04:40.196,00:04:46.202,will help get the fruit into the barn for storage -fast. -Rubble on the double!
00:04:46.286,00:04:48.538,The rest of the PAW Patrol will help too.
00:04:48.621,00:04:50.832,This job is big enough for every pup!
00:04:54.627,00:04:56.671,PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:06:13.998,00:06:15.291,Whoo!
00:06:19.629,00:06:22.298,Ryder and the PAW Patrol! Yes!
00:06:22.382,00:06:25.051,Now we'll get at least some of the fruit picked before it snows.
00:06:25.134,00:06:27.261,"We'll get all of it picked, Farmer Yumi."
00:06:27.345,00:06:29.347,No apple left behind!
00:06:29.430,00:06:32.683,"Yeah! PAW Patrol is fast, fast, fast."
00:06:35.937,00:06:37.146,All right!
00:06:40.483,00:06:43.569,"Marshall, let's get a ladder to the top of this tree."
00:06:58.960,00:06:59.877,How 'bout me?
00:06:59.961,00:07:03.714,There's got to be a way to get these apples to the barn extra fast.
00:07:03.798,00:07:05.633,I'll see what I can dig up.
00:07:06.134,00:07:07.093,What can I do?
00:07:12.432,00:07:14.684,I could put some apples in the barn!
00:07:16.602,00:07:18.521,I'll move these baskets!
00:07:20.523,00:07:21.691,Or not.
00:07:22.942,00:07:24.652,Let's get this big one!
00:07:24.735,00:07:25.653,Okay!
00:07:31.576,00:07:32.410,Help!
00:07:35.913,00:07:37.582,I'm just in the way here.
00:07:41.043,00:07:43.671,Hmm. An old rain gutter!
00:07:43.754,00:07:45.006,Perfect!
00:07:52.680,00:07:55.558,Here comes Rubble on the double.
00:07:56.058,00:08:00.062,PAW Patrol is ready to roll some pumpkins.
00:08:12.366,00:08:15.536,Oh! Whoa! Whoa! No!
00:08:17.038,00:08:19.123,Marshall! Watch out!
00:08:29.467,00:08:31.260,"Marshall, you okay?"
00:08:41.103,00:08:44.023,"Pups, this isn't how we get the job done!"
00:08:44.106,00:08:46.484,We totally got in each other's way.
00:08:46.567,00:08:47.818,Hmm.
00:08:47.902,00:08:50.738,"Chase, now I've got a job for you."
00:08:50.821,00:08:52.740,"What is it, Ryder, sir?"
00:08:52.823,00:08:55.743,We need you to direct traffic around here.
00:08:55.826,00:09:01.374,"Yeah, Chase would make a great traffic cop, 'cause, well, he is a traffic cop."
00:09:11.801,00:09:14.136,"Rocky's Fruit Chute, ready for action."
00:09:14.220,00:09:15.638,"Give it a try, Ryder."
00:09:20.268,00:09:21.644,Keep 'em coming!
00:09:21.727,00:09:23.980,"Rocky, use your truck to help Rubble!"
00:09:29.193,00:09:31.195,"Rubble, take it away!"
00:09:37.410,00:09:40.663,"Zuma and Skye, ready your pumpkins!"
00:09:43.624,00:09:44.750,Got it!
00:09:45.459,00:09:47.545,"Skye, roll yours right!"
00:09:47.628,00:09:48.796,Rolling!
00:09:51.257,00:09:52.675,Oh yeah! Uh-huh!
00:10:06.314,00:10:08.524,We got apples! Whoo-whoo!
00:10:14.739,00:10:18.075,It's getting colder and there's still a lot of pumpkins to move!
00:10:18.159,00:10:19.243,Hmm.
00:10:23.956,00:10:25.958,"Hey, Chase! Call it out!"
00:10:31.839,00:10:33.299,Whoo-hoo!
00:10:33.382,00:10:34.717,Whoa!
00:10:43.851,00:10:45.227,I'm okay.
00:10:52.777,00:10:54.528,That's the last of 'em!
00:10:56.822,00:10:58.282,We all did it.
00:10:59.617,00:11:02.078,The snow's really coming down now.
00:11:02.161,00:11:05.206,"Ryder, you and the pups saved the day!"
00:11:05.289,00:11:07.833,Now the Fall Festival is back on!
00:11:07.917,00:11:09.543,"Anytime, Farmer Yumi."
00:11:09.627,00:11:12.296,"Whenever you need us, just yelp for help!"
00:11:14.757,00:11:19.637,I declare Adventure Bay's Fall Festival now open!
00:11:30.356,00:11:31.440,Marshall!
00:11:37.154,00:11:38.781,I'm okay.
00:00:51.009,00:00:52.385,"Don't worry, Mayor Goodway."
00:00:52.469,00:00:55.055,Rubble will fix that broken step in no time.
00:00:55.138,00:00:57.974,Here comes Rubble on the double.
00:01:00.935,00:01:01.770,Bull's-eye!
00:01:01.853,00:01:03.855,Look at Rubble go!
00:01:03.938,00:01:05.190,What a pup!
00:01:05.273,00:01:06.649,Where did you find him?
00:01:18.870,00:01:21.581,I got it! I got it! I got it!
00:01:31.382,00:01:32.842,Oh no! The ball!
00:01:39.224,00:01:40.350,Got ya!
00:01:40.433,00:01:41.351,Whoops!
00:01:46.689,00:01:47.690,I'll get it!
00:01:58.201,00:01:59.494,Whoa!
00:02:02.914,00:02:04.249,Are you okay?
00:02:08.503,00:02:10.004,I'll call for help!
00:02:12.841,00:02:14.425,A pup is stuck in a tree!
00:02:14.509,00:02:15.468,Uh-oh!
00:02:17.887,00:02:20.181,Don't worry! We'll get you down from there.
00:02:20.265,00:02:21.850,I'm not worried.
00:02:36.406,00:02:41.369,"Hmm… Chase, your net, give the little guy something to climb up."
00:02:41.452,00:02:42.912,Chase is on the case!
00:02:50.253,00:02:51.129,Wow!
00:02:51.212,00:02:54.340,Cool backpack! And cool net!
00:02:54.424,00:02:55.383,Thanks.
00:02:58.678,00:03:00.930,"I told you, I'm fine."
00:03:03.516,00:03:05.810,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
00:03:09.439,00:03:11.482,Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
00:03:12.775,00:03:13.985,You're welcome.
00:03:14.068,00:03:16.029,"Hey, that tickles!"
00:03:19.866,00:03:21.367,Thanks for saving me.
00:03:21.451,00:03:22.410,It's what we do.
00:03:22.493,00:03:24.037,Were you scared out there?
00:03:32.253,00:03:34.756,"I'm Ryder. What's your name, little guy?"
00:03:37.008,00:03:39.594,"Sounds like you're a hungry pup, Rubble."
00:03:39.677,00:03:48.144,"Well… now that you mention it… Looks like you haven't eaten all day. Huh, Rubble?"
00:03:48.228,00:03:49.604,More like days.
00:03:49.687,00:03:51.522,You haven't eaten in days?
00:03:51.606,00:03:54.150,That's what it's like when you have to take care of yourself.
00:04:04.661,00:04:06.246,"Ryder, dude, it's Jake."
00:04:06.329,00:04:08.122,"Hey, Jake. Where are you?"
00:04:08.206,00:04:10.416,"Uh, I'm in a bit of a jam, bud."
00:04:10.500,00:04:13.378,I got myself trapped in a bunch of rolling snow boulders.
00:04:13.461,00:04:15.171,Snow boulders?
00:04:15.255,00:04:16.464,Are you okay?
00:04:19.717,00:04:22.929,They're too big and heavy. Think your PAW Patrol could help a buddy out?
00:04:23.012,00:04:26.349,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:04:28.476,00:04:30.061,You can count on us.
00:04:42.407,00:04:44.325,-We've got to go. -What's up?
00:04:44.409,00:04:45.827,We're the PAW Patrol.
00:04:45.910,00:04:49.998,"When Ryder calls, it means someone's in trouble and we have to help."
00:04:50.081,00:04:51.666,Hey! What's a PAW Patrol?
00:04:56.379,00:04:57.672,Look out!
00:05:00.300,00:05:02.385,I'm good at fighting fires.
00:05:02.468,00:05:04.554,I'm not so good at riding elevators.
00:05:12.770,00:05:13.938,Awesome.
00:05:22.864,00:05:25.742,Jake got trapped by some snow boulders on the mountain.
00:05:26.451,00:05:27.994,We have to dig him out.
00:05:30.913,00:05:35.418,"Skye, I need you to fly your helicopter up to the mountain to locate Jake."
00:05:40.965,00:05:43.634,"Chase, I'll need you and your winch at the top of the hill."
00:05:43.718,00:05:45.345,We might have to pull him up.
00:05:45.428,00:05:47.555,Chase is on the case!
00:05:48.264,00:05:51.184,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:06:15.917,00:06:16.918,Whoa!
00:06:31.182,00:06:32.141,Whoo-hoo!
00:07:09.303,00:07:10.138,"Hi, Rubble."
00:07:10.221,00:07:11.597,Did you like your ride?
00:07:11.681,00:07:15.726,"Oh yeah! What a great truck! Thanks for the ride, Chase."
00:07:15.810,00:07:16.644,You're welcome.
00:07:19.105,00:07:22.859,We'll use the harness and your winch so you can pull me out if I get stuck.
00:07:36.664,00:07:40.084,"I bet if I get down there, I can help Ryder get Jake out."
00:07:46.841,00:07:48.968,"How's it looking down there, Skye?"
00:07:49.051,00:07:50.553,Let me check!
00:07:57.685,00:07:58.978,I'm on my way!
00:07:59.061,00:08:00.354,"Thanks, Skye."
00:08:00.438,00:08:01.606,"Over and out, Ryder."
00:08:17.538,00:08:20.333,These snow boulders are frozen solid.
00:08:23.252,00:08:25.755,I could use a paw or two to help me move the boulders.
00:08:25.838,00:08:27.381,"I'm on my way, Ryder.."
00:08:27.465,00:08:28.508,"Hey, Rubble."
00:08:38.351,00:08:41.646,"Hey, Ryder, you're about to have some company."
00:08:44.315,00:08:47.318,"Ryder, this snowboarding is awesome."
00:08:47.401,00:08:49.362,Did you say you could use a paw?
00:08:54.700,00:08:55.993,Hang on a sec.
00:08:59.872,00:09:02.750,"Rubble, you could get trapped under there."
00:09:02.833,00:09:03.918,Rubble?
00:09:04.418,00:09:05.503,Rubble?
00:09:16.222,00:09:17.390,That tickles.
00:09:20.434,00:09:21.561,He got you out!
00:09:26.732,00:09:29.735,"So, is this digging dog the newest member of the PAW Patrol?"
00:09:35.992,00:09:36.909,What did I do?
00:09:36.993,00:09:45.251,"I found Rubble a home, where he'll have food, friends, a nice place to sleep, and a really important job."
00:09:45.334,00:09:47.211,"That's great news, Rubble."
00:09:47.295,00:09:48.713,But we're going to miss you.
00:09:48.796,00:09:51.173,Yeah. You're a cool little guy.
00:09:51.257,00:09:55.428,"You don't need to miss him, because Rubble's new home is here!"
00:09:55.511,00:09:58.097,He's the newest member of the PAW Patrol.
00:10:00.224,00:10:01.475,Really?! Really?!
00:10:04.061,00:10:08.316,"Since you love to dig so much, you can be our construction pup."
00:10:11.402,00:10:12.612,Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
00:10:12.695,00:10:14.864,-Yeah! -All right!
00:10:16.240,00:10:20.328,As long as you don't mind having your own pup house and stuff.
00:10:20.411,00:10:24.915,"Sure, I'll help you guys out, 'cause it looks like you need me."
00:10:27.376,00:10:34.008,"Rubble, as a PAW Patrol pup, do you promise to do your best to lend a paw whenever help is needed?"
00:10:38.262,00:10:40.765,Here's your official PAW Patrol pup tag.
00:10:40.848,00:10:42.933,Whoa! Cool.
00:10:43.017,00:10:47.313,"And your very own, authentic construction hard hat."
00:10:47.396,00:10:50.316,You are now a member of the PAW Patrol.
00:10:52.568,00:10:53.944,One last thing.
00:10:54.028,00:10:57.239,There's a surprise waiting for you at the bottom of the slide.
00:11:01.619,00:11:03.162,Awesome!
00:11:03.245,00:11:05.081,Whoo-hoo!
00:11:18.678,00:11:20.137,Is this for me?
00:11:20.221,00:11:25.226,"You have a little bit of growing to do before you can reach the steering wheel, but you'll get there."
00:11:27.436,00:11:30.648,And Rubble has been an extra good pup ever since.
00:11:36.237,00:11:38.114,"You sure are, Rubble."
00:00:49.883,00:00:51.092,Here you go.
00:00:54.512,00:00:55.388,Huh?
00:00:57.724,00:01:01.686,You can't fly away until after we get City Hall all fixed up.
00:01:05.315,00:01:07.484,Time to make these steps sparkle.
00:01:22.874,00:01:25.001,Balloon delivery!
00:01:25.085,00:01:26.419,Coming through!
00:01:36.262,00:01:37.680,"Almost, Mayor Goodway."
00:01:44.020,00:01:45.146,Wait.
00:01:58.118,00:01:59.828,He should be here already.
00:02:05.208,00:02:06.584,"Hello, Mayor Goodway."
00:02:06.668,00:02:08.044,Where's Grandpa Grover?
00:02:08.128,00:02:11.214,"Right behind me, all cleaned up and spiffy."
00:02:17.137,00:02:18.680,Baby whale straight ahead.
00:02:18.763,00:02:19.764,Hang on.
00:02:28.731,00:02:30.775,"Cap'n Turbot, is everything okay?"
00:02:30.859,00:02:32.819,"Oh, yeah. Just a playful little whale."
00:02:32.902,00:02:34.112,Look out!
00:02:37.365,00:02:39.701,Whoa! Wait! Ah! Come back!
00:02:41.452,00:02:44.414,Overboard? What do you mean overboard?
00:02:44.497,00:02:48.042,No need to panic. Just a small emergency.
00:02:54.465,00:02:57.927,"Ryder, I, uh… I might need a little PAW Patrol help."
00:02:58.011,00:03:05.852,It's Grandpa Grover. He's… On Great-great-great-great Grandpa Grover Day?
00:03:06.352,00:03:07.353,Ooh boy.
00:03:07.437,00:03:09.522,We have to get him back!
00:03:09.606,00:03:10.440,But how?
00:03:10.523,00:03:13.693,"Hang up, Cap'n. Call the PAW Patrol."
00:03:13.776,00:03:16.613,"Oh, he already did."
00:03:19.199,00:03:20.491,We'll get Grandpa back.
00:03:20.575,00:03:23.328,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:03:25.163,00:03:26.956,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:03:28.249,00:03:30.793,Let's go! Yay!
00:03:48.102,00:03:56.152,"Sorry, Rubble. I meant… Whoa!"
00:04:15.630,00:04:17.548,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:04:17.632,00:04:19.884,"Mayor Goodway has an emergency, pups."
00:04:19.968,00:04:24.639,Cap'n Turbot was carrying the statue of her Great-great-great-great Grandpa Grover.
00:04:27.558,00:04:29.894,Mayor Goodway loves that statue.
00:04:29.978,00:04:32.146,And the PAW Patrol is going to get it back.
00:04:33.231,00:04:38.319,"Skye, I'll need you, your copter, and your cable to lift the statue to the surface."
00:04:43.074,00:04:46.369,"Zuma, I'll need you to scuba dive down to attach the cable."
00:04:46.452,00:04:47.996,Let's dive in!
00:04:48.079,00:04:50.999,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:06:09.911,00:06:13.081,"Oh, PAW Patrol! Am I glad to see you!"
00:06:13.164,00:06:14.624,"Don't worry, Cap'n Turbot."
00:06:17.168,00:06:18.252,Where did he go in?
00:06:29.972,00:06:31.557,There he is!
00:06:32.558,00:06:34.352,On the edge of that steep slope!
00:06:40.149,00:06:43.152,"Okay, Skye! You're right above the statue."
00:06:43.236,00:06:44.862,"I'm on it, Ryder."
00:06:47.281,00:06:49.742,"Okay, Zuma, let's get our gear on."
00:07:32.410,00:07:36.998,Grandpa Grover got knocked over and now he's at the edge of a deep underwater canyon.
00:07:37.081,00:07:39.542,Skye's cable isn't long enough to reach him now.
00:07:39.625,00:07:40.668,What can we do?
00:07:40.751,00:07:42.503,We have to think of something.
00:07:42.587,00:07:46.090,I promised Mayor Goodway I'd take care of Grandpa Grover!
00:07:46.174,00:07:49.844,We need some way to float the statue to the surface.
00:07:49.927,00:07:53.014,Something like… balloons!
00:07:53.097,00:07:55.516,"Balloons! Oh, great idea, Ryder."
00:07:55.600,00:07:57.518,That's how they raise sunken ships.
00:08:02.523,00:08:04.525,"Right here, Ryder. What's up?"
00:08:04.609,00:08:07.153,The helicopter cable won't reach the statue.
00:08:07.236,00:08:08.321,What do you need?
00:08:08.404,00:08:10.364,A big balloon to go underwater.
00:08:10.448,00:08:14.785,"We'll tie it to Grandpa, fill it with helium, and it will lift him to the surface for us."
00:08:14.869,00:08:17.330,I've got the perfect balloon stashed at the Lookout.
00:08:17.413,00:08:20.166,Great! Bring it and the helium tank to the dock.
00:08:20.249,00:08:21.459,Zuma's on his way.
00:08:23.377,00:08:26.214,There's the helium tank and here's the balloon.
00:08:26.297,00:08:28.841,"Thanks, Rocky. This should work great."
00:08:36.015,00:08:37.391,"Good work, Zuma."
00:08:39.143,00:08:41.103,"You set with the helium tank, Ryder?"
00:08:41.187,00:08:42.230,All set.
00:08:42.313,00:08:44.273,"Zuma, you take the balloon down."
00:08:44.357,00:08:49.278,"We'll hook it to the statue, fill it with helium, and it'll lift the statue up to the surface."
00:08:49.362,00:08:50.530,Let's go!
00:09:27.733,00:09:29.694,"Whoo-hoo! It worked, Ryder!"
00:09:29.777,00:09:31.320,It worked really well!
00:09:32.863,00:09:34.949,"Pretty awesome rescue, dude."
00:09:35.032,00:09:37.118,We can't let him fly away.
00:09:37.201,00:09:38.953,"Skye, can you get Grandpa home?"
00:09:39.036,00:09:40.454,"You got it, Ryder!"
00:09:45.459,00:09:47.336,Let's take to the sky!
00:09:57.680,00:09:59.765,"See you at City Hall, Ryder!"
00:10:04.395,00:10:07.773,"Welcome, Goodways, young and old!"
00:10:09.066,00:10:12.653,"Gustavo, Julius, and Justina!"
00:10:12.737,00:10:14.322,Isn't something missing?
00:10:14.405,00:10:27.418,"Yes. Well, uh, I sent Grandpa Grover out to be cleaned, and well… it seems he, uh… It's Great-great-great-great Grandpa Grover Day and there's no Great-great-great-great Grandpa Grover?"
00:10:33.591,00:10:35.092,Grandpa Grover!
00:10:37.428,00:10:39.847,Hurray! Grandpa Grover is back!
00:10:41.098,00:10:43.267,Of course he's back.
00:10:50.191,00:10:54.278,"Ryder, pups, you did it! How can we thank you?"
00:10:57.531,00:11:00.493,The PAW Patrol saved the day!
00:11:00.576,00:11:02.787,They saved Grandpa Grover Day!
00:11:02.870,00:11:05.247,Grandpa has never looked so shiny.
00:11:11.212,00:11:13.881,-Sure does. -Wait. Look.
00:11:18.302,00:11:20.304,I've got a squid on my lid!
00:11:23.140,00:11:24.225,"Thanks, Ryder."
00:11:33.651,00:11:35.361,You've all been good pups today.
00:11:35.444,00:11:36.779,Go have some fun.
00:00:47.422,00:00:50.300,Foggy Bottom wins the cake contest.
00:00:50.383,00:00:54.512,Accepting for Foggy Bottom is me!
00:00:55.597,00:00:58.933,"Mmm, mmm. Victory tastes good."
00:00:59.017,00:01:03.313,"Careful, Mayor Humdinger. Too much cake can give you a tummy ache."
00:01:03.396,00:01:07.108,Foggy Bottom won last year's Tallest and Tastiest Cake Contest.
00:01:07.192,00:01:09.110,But this year will be different.
00:01:09.194,00:01:12.572,"Yeah, Mr. Porter's going to win for Adventure Bay."
00:01:12.655,00:01:13.948,"Right, Mr. Porter?"
00:01:14.032,00:01:15.075,I'll do my best.
00:01:17.535,00:01:21.456,"All the cakes have to be built, baked, and brought here by lunchtime today."
00:01:21.539,00:01:23.041,Lunchtime?
00:01:26.127,00:01:28.463,"Rubble and Marshall, why don't you lend a paw?"
00:01:28.546,00:01:33.301,"Yeah, Mr. Porter always lets us lick the bowl when he's baking."
00:01:33.384,00:01:34.636,-Yum. -Yum.
00:01:34.719,00:01:37.013,Just make sure you don't get in the way.
00:01:37.097,00:01:38.765,We won't be in the way.
00:01:38.848,00:01:41.643,We'll just see if he needs any help.
00:01:46.940,00:01:49.067,What kind of cake is it going to be?
00:01:49.150,00:01:50.944,I was saving that for a surprise.
00:01:51.027,00:01:53.446,But it's a Lookout cake.
00:01:56.658,00:01:59.536,I'll build it cake brick by cake brick.
00:02:00.120,00:02:01.830,"Like these, Grandpa?"
00:02:01.913,00:02:02.789,Yes.
00:02:03.331,00:02:04.624,How many do you need?
00:02:04.707,00:02:06.501,"Oh, about 1,000."
00:02:06.584,00:02:08.670,-How many have you made? -Three.
00:02:08.753,00:02:10.672,"Oh, only three?"
00:02:10.755,00:02:14.384,I kind of got distracted by my race cars.
00:02:15.635,00:02:16.928,Something's burning.
00:02:30.400,00:02:32.026,I'll have to start over again!
00:02:32.110,00:02:35.613,"I need flour and sugar and eggs. Hold these, please."
00:02:37.282,00:02:39.993,How will I finish my cake in time for the contest?
00:02:41.244,00:02:43.663,with some help from the PAW Patrol.
00:02:43.746,00:02:45.748,"Yeah, that's a great idea."
00:02:45.832,00:02:47.959,Of course. I'll call Ryder.
00:02:52.297,00:02:53.923,"Hi, Mr. Porter. What's up?"
00:02:54.007,00:02:55.592,It's the cake! It's burned!
00:02:55.675,00:02:57.677,I have to start over. And I need help.
00:02:57.760,00:03:01.806,"Don't worry, Mr. Porter. No cake is too big. No pup is too small."
00:03:10.815,00:03:12.192,What's with the eggs?
00:03:22.911,00:03:24.954,"Oops. Sorry, guys."
00:03:25.038,00:03:28.625,I eggs-identally tripped.
00:03:47.769,00:03:49.771,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:03:52.148,00:03:53.733,"Thanks for hustling, pups."
00:03:53.816,00:03:58.529,We have to help Mr. Porter fix the Lookout cake and get it to city hall before the contest starts.
00:03:59.864,00:04:03.993,"Marshall, we need your water cannons to fill the cake pans with batter, fast."
00:04:04.077,00:04:05.620,I'm fired up!
00:04:07.288,00:04:11.292,"Rubble, we'll need your shovel to help lift cake pans and bags of flour."
00:04:11.376,00:04:13.586,Rubble on the double!
00:04:15.213,00:04:18.841,"Rocky, I need you and your tool arm to help cut the cake into bricks."
00:04:18.925,00:04:20.551,Green means go!
00:04:32.188,00:04:34.190,PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:05:31.039,00:05:32.915,Rubble on the double!
00:05:39.464,00:05:40.631,"Thanks, Rubble."
00:05:43.509,00:05:45.053,The cake batter is all ready.
00:05:46.971,00:05:48.139,"Okay, Marshall."
00:05:58.399,00:05:59.734,"Sorry, Mr. Porter."
00:06:00.777,00:06:02.070,Not a problem.
00:06:09.035,00:06:10.536,Cake pans coming through!
00:06:10.620,00:06:13.831,We'll have to hurry. We still need 997 cake bricks.
00:06:38.773,00:06:44.946,"If nothing else goes wrong, we might have just enough time to ice the cake before the contest ends."
00:06:52.495,00:06:53.830,"Sorry, Mr. Porter."
00:06:55.498,00:06:57.500,My cars and track!
00:06:57.583,00:06:59.419,I should have cleaned them up.
00:06:59.502,00:07:01.295,"It was an accident, Alex."
00:07:01.379,00:07:03.798,But now I have to make more icing.
00:07:06.384,00:07:08.761,It'll get finished in time if we all pitch in.
00:07:25.862,00:07:29.031,"Good enough to eat, but something's missing."
00:07:29.115,00:07:30.116,Hmm.
00:07:33.161,00:07:34.829,We don't have time to make one.
00:07:34.912,00:07:37.165,We have to get the cake to city hall right now.
00:07:38.958,00:07:40.460,Let's get this cake loaded.
00:07:48.009,00:07:50.094,"Okay, Rocky, take it slow."
00:07:52.096,00:07:53.681,Aim for the base.
00:07:53.764,00:07:57.018,"Slow, slow, you got it!"
00:07:59.812,00:08:03.149,"Whoa, Rocky, it's tipping over!"
00:08:10.281,00:08:15.203,"Hey, how about-- There's got to be something here we can use."
00:08:23.669,00:08:26.881,We can curve it around the tower just like the slide.
00:08:26.964,00:08:28.591,"Great idea, Alex!"
00:08:33.304,00:08:37.099,"Good thing I left out my cars and track, huh, Grandpa?"
00:08:37.183,00:08:42.271,"Well, using the track to hold up the cake was a very good idea."
00:08:43.272,00:08:44.106,There.
00:08:44.190,00:08:46.734,The cake is straight again!
00:08:46.817,00:08:48.486,And now it has a slide.
00:08:48.569,00:08:50.154,I sure hope it's the tallest.
00:08:50.238,00:08:52.615,Let's get moving. Time's almost up.
00:08:59.038,00:09:03.417,And the best thing about my fantastic fish cake is that it's made of fish.
00:09:04.085,00:09:05.336,Ew.
00:09:08.339,00:09:11.092,The icing is made from actual fish scales!
00:09:15.846,00:09:16.681,Blegh.
00:09:18.057,00:09:23.145,"Oh, look, the hot-air-balloon cake… again."
00:09:27.525,00:09:28.442,Hmph.
00:09:31.696,00:09:35.825,"In ten seconds, there will be no more entries allowed in the cake contest."
00:09:35.908,00:09:41.455,"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six… Oh no!"
00:09:41.539,00:09:51.632,"-Ah! -…five, four You did it make it, just in time."
00:09:51.716,00:09:55.052,The Tallest and Tastiest Cake Contest is closed.
00:09:57.680,00:09:59.181,Mm-hmm.
00:10:04.562,00:10:05.980,Mmm.
00:10:10.192,00:10:11.110,Hmm.
00:10:14.655,00:10:25.333,Tallest… Hmm.
00:10:29.253,00:10:31.088,-What? -It's official!
00:10:31.172,00:10:34.592,The winner is Mr. Porter and his Lookout Tower cake.
00:10:38.721,00:10:39.764,Yeah!
00:10:39.847,00:10:41.891,"Congratulations, Mr. Porter."
00:10:45.311,00:10:46.479,Our pleasure.
00:10:46.562,00:10:52.234,"If you ever need a paw, just yelp-- For help."
00:10:52.318,00:10:54.570,I guess there's only one thing left to do.
00:10:54.654,00:10:57.406,-Let them eat cake! -Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
00:10:57.490,00:11:01.243,You heard him. Go get a piece. You're all good pups.
00:11:01.327,00:11:07.708,"Guess you need to put just a little bit more hot air in your balloon cake next year, Mayor Humdinger."
00:11:36.529,00:11:38.823,"Marshall, you sure do take the cake."
00:01:06.483,00:01:07.859,"Got it, Katie!"
00:01:08.526,00:01:11.071,"Okay, Ryder, as far as you can throw it."
00:01:11.654,00:01:13.114,Here it goes!
00:01:13.198,00:01:15.867,Whoa… I got it! I got it!
00:01:17.452,00:01:18.661,I'm gonna get it!
00:01:18.745,00:01:19.954,Whoa!
00:01:20.038,00:01:20.914,I'm gonna get it!
00:01:23.374,00:01:28.713,I can't believe we've been playing all afternoon without you and the pups racing off to an emergency.
00:01:35.637,00:01:39.099,We have a huge problem at City Hall. I can't ring the bell.
00:01:39.182,00:01:40.100,Why not?
00:01:40.183,00:01:42.352,Someone is sleeping under it.
00:01:44.604,00:01:48.149,"Uh-oh, ringing the bell would scare that little bat for sure."
00:01:48.233,00:01:51.486,But Chickaletta won't wake up from her nap until she hears that bell.
00:01:52.487,00:01:54.239,Don't worry. We can help.
00:01:54.322,00:01:57.325,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:02:03.039,00:02:05.792,Uh… Frisbee or Lookout?
00:02:15.718,00:02:17.387,Frisbee and Lookout.
00:02:35.738,00:02:37.991,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:02:43.079,00:02:45.206,"Thanks for hurrying, pups."
00:02:45.290,00:02:49.085,"A baby bat is asleep at City Hall, hanging from the bell."
00:02:49.169,00:02:52.172,This kind of bat usually lives with lots of other bats.
00:02:52.255,00:02:55.133,"If he's alone, he's probably lost."
00:03:03.474,00:03:05.310,Be careful not to wake the bat.
00:03:05.393,00:03:06.352,Why not?
00:03:06.436,00:03:09.480,Bats are nocturnal. They sleep in the day.
00:03:09.564,00:03:13.026,"Besides, it's a lot easier to catch a sleeping bat."
00:03:13.109,00:03:16.112,Ready for a ruff-ruff rescue!
00:03:22.202,00:03:26.873,"Chase, I need you ready with your net, in case the little bat starts to fly off."
00:04:49.038,00:04:50.957,"Oh, Ryder, thank you for coming."
00:04:51.040,00:04:52.166,No problem.
00:04:54.669,00:04:57.964,"Chase, get ready with your net, but quietly."
00:05:05.430,00:05:07.223,"Remember, quietly."
00:05:07.307,00:05:08.349,Got it.
00:05:28.202,00:05:29.996,Shh! Don't wake him.
00:05:40.256,00:05:41.591,Bat on the loose!
00:05:41.674,00:05:43.885,Oh! Ee! Oh! Ow!
00:05:47.388,00:05:48.848,"Marshall, are you okay?"
00:05:51.225,00:05:52.393,I got him!
00:06:00.193,00:06:02.987,"Sorry, Ryder. We let him get away."
00:06:03.071,00:06:05.073,And I think we woke him up.
00:06:07.158,00:06:07.992,We'll find him.
00:06:08.076,00:06:10.244,At least now you can ring the bell.
00:06:10.328,00:06:11.371,Excellent.
00:06:14.624,00:06:17.168,Love this remote control bell ringing app.
00:06:21.631,00:06:23.132,"Oh, thank goodness."
00:06:23.216,00:06:25.676,Chickaletta's awake and ready for her snack.
00:06:27.929,00:06:29.597,How will we find the bat now?
00:06:33.309,00:06:35.520,"Ryder, we can't finish our soccer game."
00:06:35.603,00:06:38.064,There's a bat hanging upside-down from the soccer net.
00:06:40.358,00:06:41.275,"Hi, Ryder."
00:06:41.359,00:06:45.238,"Skye, I need you to find the bat cave. We need to get this little guy home."
00:07:03.798,00:07:05.425,Let's let him sleep this time.
00:07:10.304,00:07:11.639,"Thanks for coming, Ryder."
00:07:13.975,00:07:17.687,"Yeah, bats are for baseball, not soccer."
00:07:20.606,00:07:22.775,Don't worry. We'll get the little guy home.
00:07:24.318,00:07:26.070,"Skye, have you found anything?"
00:07:26.154,00:07:27.488,"Hang on, Ryder."
00:07:29.740,00:07:31.367,I see a cave!
00:07:36.706,00:07:38.958,Bats! This must be the cave!
00:07:39.041,00:07:41.127,"I knew you'd find it, Skye."
00:07:41.210,00:07:43.588,Now we just have to get the bat into the carrier.
00:07:47.383,00:07:49.010,Shh! Don't wake the bat.
00:07:50.470,00:07:52.346,Shoo! Go find another perch.
00:07:57.685,00:07:59.061,I don't know.
00:08:00.563,00:08:02.023,The bat's waking up.
00:08:02.106,00:08:03.274,Hang on.
00:08:14.327,00:08:15.786,"Pull 'er up, Marshall."
00:08:35.473,00:08:37.183,and the bat cave is up there.
00:08:39.101,00:08:41.479,"Skye, can you lift the carrier up to the cave?"
00:08:43.147,00:08:44.524,"Roger that, Ryder."
00:09:12.885,00:09:13.928,Got it!
00:09:20.142,00:09:21.769,Isn't this where you live?
00:09:30.403,00:09:33.030,"The eagle, it's nest must be around here."
00:09:37.326,00:09:39.620,That's why the bat won't fly back into his cave.
00:09:39.704,00:09:41.581,He's afraid of the eagle.
00:09:46.669,00:09:47.628,Skye?
00:10:17.408,00:10:19.327,"Chase, low beam."
00:10:30.254,00:10:33.174,Aw! They sound happy to see him.
00:10:33.257,00:10:36.052,Now the little bat can finally get a good night's sleep.
00:10:50.232,00:10:51.317,"Ready, Marshall?"
00:10:51.400,00:10:53.110,I'm fired up!
00:10:53.194,00:10:54.612,"-Go, Marshall! -Marshall, yeah!"
00:10:58.449,00:11:00.117,-Aw! -Do we have to?
00:11:00.201,00:11:01.827,We can play more tomorrow.
00:11:02.870,00:11:05.873,"Hey, pups, look! It's our little bat friend."
00:11:05.956,00:11:08.542,"Ryder, can we have a sleep out with the little bat?"
00:11:08.626,00:11:09.627,"Yeah, can we?"
00:11:09.710,00:11:13.422,"Hmm… Well, you're such good pups, of course you can!"
00:11:13.506,00:11:14.632,-Yay! -Yes!
00:11:18.386,00:11:20.221,"Hey, where's Marshall?"
00:11:20.304,00:11:23.015,Here I come! Whoa!
00:11:35.319,00:11:37.905,"Goodnight, pups. Goodnight, little bat."
00:00:52.886,00:00:54.763,I know you're around here!
00:00:59.934,00:01:04.105,"Now, to get an egg-straordinary picture of the birdie with her egg!"
00:01:07.817,00:01:10.153,Ah! Nice booby bird!
00:01:10.236,00:01:12.363,"Nice-- Ah, whoa!"
00:01:14.741,00:01:16.326,Whoa!
00:01:17.243,00:01:19.412,I just need to get out.
00:01:19.496,00:01:20.538,I'm stuck!
00:01:22.916,00:01:24.292,Ow!
00:01:26.419,00:01:28.630,"Ah, a crabby crustacean."
00:01:37.430,00:01:38.556,Hmm.
00:01:40.558,00:01:42.018,Cool cavern!
00:01:48.358,00:01:51.611,Maybe even the hideout of Captain Blackfur.
00:01:53.404,00:01:54.614,Yah!
00:01:58.743,00:02:00.161,How will I get out of here?
00:02:05.667,00:02:06.626,"Ready, Marshall?"
00:02:24.811,00:02:27.480,"It's okay, Marshall. I kind of expected it."
00:02:29.315,00:02:30.984,I know how you can get a basket.
00:02:38.116,00:02:39.075,"Hi, Cap'n Turbot!"
00:02:39.159,00:02:40.577,"I need some help, Ryder!"
00:02:42.453,00:02:43.496,What happened?
00:02:43.580,00:02:48.751,I was up on the cliff trying to take booby bird pictures when I fell into a pirate's hideout.
00:02:48.835,00:02:49.878,Pirates?
00:02:49.961,00:02:58.052,"Yes, I'm almost totally completely unquestionably confident I could maybe possibly perhaps have fallen into the lost lair of the mysterious Captain Blackfur!"
00:02:58.136,00:02:59.888,Wow! Really?
00:03:02.849,00:03:05.393,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:03:07.103,00:03:09.814,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:03:11.649,00:03:12.734,"Launch it, Zuma!"
00:03:17.363,00:03:19.407,Whoa!
00:03:23.578,00:03:27.040,"Hey, I'm supposed to be the flying pup around here!"
00:03:27.123,00:03:28.708,That's fine with me.
00:03:46.851,00:03:48.811,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:03:50.188,00:03:53.066,"Thanks for getting here so quickly, pups!"
00:03:53.149,00:03:59.906,Cap'n Turbot was taking pictures of the blue-footed booby bird… -…when he fell into a hidden cavern. -A hidden cavern?
00:03:59.989,00:04:02.951,"Yeah, a cavern filled with pirate stuff."
00:04:03.034,00:04:05.954,He even thinks it might belong to Captain Blackfur.
00:04:06.037,00:04:07.205,Blackfur?
00:04:07.288,00:04:09.832,Adventure Bay's most mysterious pirate?
00:04:09.916,00:04:11.334,Exactly!
00:04:11.417,00:04:15.630,"According to legend, no one knows what he looked like or what happened to his treasure."
00:04:15.755,00:04:17.507,"Oh, pick me! Pick me!"
00:04:27.725,00:04:29.936,Chase is on the case!
00:04:30.019,00:04:32.522,And then… Rubble!
00:04:36.401,00:04:38.695,Rubble on the double!
00:04:38.778,00:04:40.947,"The rest of you pups, stand by."
00:04:41.030,00:04:42.532,I still might need you.
00:04:42.615,00:04:45.868,"All right, PAW Patrol is on a roll!"
00:05:49.891,00:05:52.060,"Okay, let's find that cave entrance."
00:05:56.856,00:05:58.608,"Cap'n Turbot, you all right?"
00:05:58.691,00:06:00.902,"Ahoy, Ryder, I'm doing dandy!"
00:06:22.507,00:06:25.093,"Steady, there you are."
00:06:25.176,00:06:26.094,"Thanks, Cap'n!"
00:06:26.177,00:06:27.929,"Am I glad to see you, Ryder!"
00:06:28.429,00:06:29.389,Look what I found!
00:06:39.774,00:06:40.900,Good question!
00:06:43.111,00:06:45.780,Like a tunnel of some sort.
00:06:52.453,00:06:57.166,"I sure hope there aren't any spiders down here, like on the floor!"
00:06:57.250,00:06:58.835,"Ooh, spider cooties!"
00:07:00.336,00:07:02.713,"Thanks, Chase! Rubble's down!"
00:07:03.881,00:07:06.509,"Whoa, this is cool!"
00:07:08.344,00:07:09.262,Ah!
00:07:11.180,00:07:13.641,"Great catch, Ryder. Thanks!"
00:07:29.198,00:07:31.284,"Hey, Rubble, check this out!"
00:07:32.243,00:07:33.911,Whoa!
00:07:33.995,00:07:35.913,A real pirate hat!
00:07:35.997,00:07:38.458,That was on a real pirate's head?
00:07:40.126,00:07:42.587,"Argh, shiver me timbers!"
00:07:46.340,00:07:48.384,I think I smell something.
00:07:49.218,00:07:50.303,A-ha!
00:07:55.308,00:07:56.184,…sea water!
00:07:56.267,00:07:58.352,That must be the way to the beach!
00:08:00.897,00:08:02.648,"Rubble, you know what to do."
00:08:02.732,00:08:05.818,"Argh, stand back, land-lubbers!"
00:08:10.865,00:08:12.700,This is going to take a while.
00:08:16.787,00:08:18.039,Phew!
00:08:23.586,00:08:24.962,I hear waves.
00:08:25.046,00:08:27.924,We'd better get Zuma to tell us what it looks like from the beach side.
00:08:30.384,00:08:31.594,North Shore beach?
00:08:31.677,00:08:32.929,"On my way, Ryder!"
00:08:36.307,00:08:37.725,"It's all beach here, Ryder."
00:08:37.808,00:08:39.602,You're going to come out right on the sand.
00:08:40.603,00:08:43.231,"All right, let's hit the beach!"
00:08:53.115,00:08:53.950,Yeah!
00:09:07.505,00:09:08.548,"Thanks, Rubble."
00:09:08.631,00:09:09.715,No worries.
00:09:09.799,00:09:11.467,Check out this old bottle.
00:09:11.551,00:09:13.469,It looks like there's something in it.
00:09:13.553,00:09:16.806,A bottle with a message! Yes!
00:09:16.889,00:09:19.267,That must have been buried in the tunnel.
00:09:22.895,00:09:24.814,It looks like an old map.
00:09:24.897,00:09:27.066,A pirate treasure map?
00:09:27.149,00:09:30.319,"Could be, but part of it's missing."
00:09:30.403,00:09:33.823,There's no X to mark the spot where the treasure should be buried.
00:09:33.906,00:09:35.700,Looks like we've got a mystery.
00:09:38.869,00:09:40.580,A pirate treasure map!
00:09:42.206,00:09:45.084,This could be our most epic adventure ever!
00:09:56.887,00:09:58.347,Whoa!
00:10:03.686,00:10:05.938,Did you really find a treasure map?
00:10:07.857,00:10:12.194,"Wow, I've never seen a real treasure map before!"
00:10:19.243,00:10:21.037,What happened to the rest of it?
00:10:21.120,00:10:24.498,Captain Blackfur hid two more parts of the map.
00:10:24.582,00:10:25.416,Listen!
00:10:25.499,00:10:31.505,A priceless treasure awaits ye who finds the map torn into three.
00:10:35.176,00:10:39.972,The part of the map that you seek hides in the big parrot's beak.
00:10:40.056,00:10:42.391,Big parrot? In Adventure Bay?
00:10:42.475,00:10:46.646,"Hey, those boulders at the bottom of Jake's mountain kind of look like a parrot."
00:10:46.729,00:10:48.022,"Yeah, let's check it out."
00:11:02.453,00:11:03.621,Good luck!
00:00:52.510,00:00:53.386,Huh?
00:00:56.222,00:00:57.682,Getting windy out here!
00:01:13.823,00:01:17.744,It's the So You Think You Can Pup Pup Boogie dance-off.
00:01:21.873,00:01:23.792,The splits?
00:01:26.461,00:01:27.337,Yes!
00:01:28.463,00:01:29.339,And no.
00:01:31.966,00:01:34.260,"Uh, can I get a paw here?"
00:01:36.429,00:01:37.639,Now I'm out!
00:01:41.559,00:01:43.311,Big spin!
00:01:53.154,00:01:54.364,Whoa!
00:01:59.577,00:02:03.581,"Alex, look! The perfect picture for the Adventure Bay poster."
00:02:03.665,00:02:06.167,"-Mayor Goodway! -One moment, Alex."
00:02:06.251,00:02:10.880,But Mayor Goodway… I'm getting an exciting waterfowl action shot.
00:02:15.426,00:02:17.720,"But look at that, Mayor Goodway!"
00:02:27.188,00:02:28.606,Can we get a closer look?
00:02:28.690,00:02:29.858,Great idea!
00:02:29.941,00:02:32.610,I can get some close-ups. Let's row out a little.
00:02:39.659,00:02:42.495,"Sorry, Wally, no snacks right now."
00:02:42.579,00:02:45.540,We're going to see the super cute narwhal.
00:02:51.254,00:02:54.841,"-You can't touch this. -Watch and learn, dude."
00:02:59.971,00:03:02.140,Look at all the old fetch balls I'm going to recycle.
00:03:02.223,00:03:05.351,"Left, right, turn, jump!"
00:03:06.352,00:03:09.189,Whoa! Whoa!
00:03:20.325,00:03:23.411,Look! The whale wants to play!
00:03:25.413,00:03:28.291,"Oh, Alex and Mayor Goodway are going whale watching."
00:03:34.088,00:03:35.798,"Oops, my raincoat!"
00:03:46.893,00:03:48.519,I'm locked in the lighthouse!
00:03:57.111,00:03:58.696,"Who are you cheering for, Ryder?"
00:04:03.284,00:04:06.037,"It's Cap'n Turbot, Ryder. I've got a bit of a problem."
00:04:06.120,00:04:07.705,"What's wrong, Captain?"
00:04:07.789,00:04:11.376,"Well, a storm is blowing in, and Mayor Goodway and Alex are out on the water!"
00:04:19.259,00:04:20.927,could you rescue me?
00:04:24.931,00:04:27.558,"Sure thing, Cap'n. We're on our way."
00:04:33.982,00:04:37.610,Who rules at Pup Pup Boogie? That would be me.
00:04:45.868,00:04:47.745,Whoa!
00:04:51.916,00:04:54.043,"Look, all tidied up."
00:04:54.961,00:04:55.920,Almost.
00:05:13.271,00:05:15.148,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:05:16.524,00:05:20.903,"Sorry to interrupt your dance contest, pups, but we've got some rescuing to do."
00:05:20.987,00:05:25.908,"Mayor Goodway and Alex rode out to do some whale watching, but didn't know there was a storm coming in."
00:05:25.992,00:05:28.619,"Cap'n Turbot tried to help, but got stuck in the lighthouse."
00:05:30.246,00:05:34.000,"Skye, I need your helicopter and goggles to find the rowboat."
00:05:35.001,00:05:36.794,Let's take to the sky.
00:05:38.755,00:05:41.966,"Zuma, I need you and your hovercraft to tow the boat in."
00:05:42.050,00:05:44.052,"All right, but let's do it fast."
00:05:44.135,00:05:45.636,"What's the hurry, Zuma?"
00:05:45.720,00:05:49.766,It's the first time I ever made the Pup Pup Boogie Dance-off Finals.
00:05:49.849,00:05:51.267,And I'm going to win!
00:05:51.351,00:05:54.437,"It's okay, Zuma. I can out-dance you after you're done."
00:05:54.520,00:05:56.230,"In your dreams, dude."
00:05:57.357,00:05:59.275,PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:07:15.435,00:07:16.769,"How's it going, Skye?"
00:07:16.853,00:07:20.898,"This wind's really strong, but I'm hanging in there."
00:07:23.943,00:07:27.196,"Ryder, it's too windy for my helicopter."
00:07:28.573,00:07:29.949,"Be careful, Skye."
00:07:39.876,00:07:42.044,-Let's get back to shore. -I can help.
00:07:56.601,00:07:57.643,Ah!
00:08:00.396,00:08:01.481,Whee!
00:08:01.564,00:08:04.442,"Oh, dear, the waves are too big. What should we do?"
00:08:09.280,00:08:12.533,"Okay, Alex, let's row together."
00:08:12.617,00:08:14.327,Another wave!
00:08:14.410,00:08:17.371,Whee!
00:08:17.455,00:08:18.539,Whoa!
00:08:20.458,00:08:23.711,I'm calm. I'm calm!
00:08:29.967,00:08:32.803,I can't search for the boat until the wind calms down.
00:08:32.887,00:08:36.015,See if you can get into Cap'n Turbot's lighthouse.
00:08:36.098,00:08:38.017,You can spot them from there.
00:08:50.821,00:08:52.907,"Oh, look out! Whoa!"
00:09:02.083,00:09:05.002,"Ryder, the boat is north of Seal Island."
00:09:05.086,00:09:07.463,"Thanks, Skye! We're on our way."
00:09:12.468,00:09:14.053,Look at the pretty sunset.
00:09:14.136,00:09:18.349,Sunset? We're in the middle of a horrible storm and I'm paddling in circles. How can you be so calm?
00:09:18.432,00:09:20.893,"Hey, I can see Ryder and Zuma."
00:09:28.276,00:09:29.402,Buoy.
00:09:35.533,00:09:37.952,Whoa!
00:09:38.035,00:09:38.995,Oh!
00:09:39.078,00:09:40.788,"Thank you, Wally."
00:09:44.834,00:09:48.045,The coolest animal ever saved the day!
00:09:51.424,00:09:53.217,Hooray for Wally!
00:09:58.973,00:10:00.433,Let's get you to shore.
00:10:04.395,00:10:06.856,It's getting dark and it's still pretty stormy.
00:10:06.939,00:10:09.025,We should stop at Cap'n Turbot's lighthouse.
00:10:29.086,00:10:30.838,We couldn't do it without Wally!
00:10:38.971,00:10:40.848,"Thanks, Cap'n Turbot."
00:10:40.931,00:10:41.807,"Thanks, Wally!"
00:10:45.394,00:10:47.104,Let's get inside and dry off.
00:10:47.188,00:10:48.189,"Bye, Wally!"
00:10:49.190,00:10:51.150,"-Yeah… -What's wrong, Zuma?"
00:10:54.612,00:10:56.947,"Pup Pup Boogie? Oh, I love that game!"
00:10:57.031,00:10:58.616,I'm a real boogie master.
00:10:58.699,00:11:00.951,You play Pup Pup Boogie?
00:11:14.215,00:11:17.468,"Hang on, Zuma. Chase will be here in one second."
00:11:17.551,00:11:18.469,Huh?
00:11:21.889,00:11:25.059,"Great rescue, Zuma. Now you're ready to boogie."
00:11:25.142,00:11:27.603,"Whoa, dude, this is so cool!"
00:11:27.687,00:11:30.022,"Thanks, Cap'n Turbot. Thanks, Ryder."
00:11:30.106,00:11:32.358,Thanks for being such good pups.
00:00:48.631,00:00:49.466,Ta-da!
00:00:57.849,00:01:00.810,Wow! That snowman almost looks real.
00:01:14.199,00:01:15.658,It's just Ryder.
00:01:15.742,00:01:17.243,"Nice job, pups."
00:01:17.327,00:01:19.829,I've brought some stuff to keep this snowman toasty.
00:01:21.122,00:01:22.791,Especially in this wind.
00:01:22.874,00:01:24.209,I'll get the nose.
00:01:29.255,00:01:31.883,Whoa! Whoa!
00:01:52.529,00:01:56.074,"Okay, Alex. Let's get the food and treats up to the Lookout."
00:01:56.157,00:01:58.326,Those pups have healthy appetites.
00:01:58.409,00:02:02.497,"Careful, this walk is still sli-i-i-ppery!"
00:02:10.130,00:02:12.257,I don't want to lose my lucky hat.
00:02:15.468,00:02:17.053,Whoa!
00:02:18.138,00:02:19.514,"Grandpa, are you okay?"
00:02:19.597,00:02:20.598,I'm good.
00:02:20.682,00:02:23.601,It'll take more than a rump bump to slow me down.
00:02:40.702,00:02:42.620,Gotta be careful on these turns.
00:02:42.704,00:02:46.040,Whoa! Whoa!
00:02:52.422,00:02:55.091,It's kind of stuck!
00:03:01.472,00:03:02.307,Oh no!
00:03:03.558,00:03:04.601,My van!
00:03:07.020,00:03:08.021,Come back!
00:03:13.193,00:03:14.694,It's on the ice!
00:03:15.361,00:03:17.030,Cool!
00:03:17.113,00:03:18.198,Not so cool.
00:03:18.281,00:03:19.532,That ice can break.
00:03:21.409,00:03:23.536,Whoa! Ice is dangerous!
00:03:31.961,00:03:35.381,"If it breaks any more, it will sink to the bottom of the bay!"
00:03:35.465,00:03:37.634,The pups won't get their food.
00:03:47.060,00:03:48.937,I'm too fast for you!
00:03:50.855,00:03:52.565,You're it!
00:03:53.107,00:03:53.942,Oh!
00:03:55.526,00:03:57.111,I'm starving!
00:03:58.613,00:04:03.117,Ryder said Mr. Porter is bringing some super special treats.
00:04:03.201,00:04:04.535,Mmm!
00:04:09.082,00:04:09.916,Ryder here.
00:04:09.999,00:04:15.755,"Ryder, we, um, ran into a little bad luck with the pup food delivery."
00:04:22.303,00:04:24.847,Uh-oh! That means the pup food too!
00:04:24.931,00:04:28.935,Don't worry. No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:04:36.609,00:04:38.611,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:04:42.365,00:04:43.866,Let's go!
00:04:47.161,00:04:48.454,Whoa! Uh-oh!
00:04:55.878,00:04:57.630,Ah!
00:05:03.845,00:05:04.679,Made it!
00:05:20.111,00:05:22.155,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:05:24.907,00:05:29.454,Mr. Porter was on his way to deliver your food when his van rolled out onto the bay.
00:05:30.955,00:05:31.956,On the ice?!
00:05:32.040,00:05:33.249,That's way bad!
00:05:33.333,00:05:35.251,"Yeah, I haven't had lunch."
00:05:35.335,00:05:39.339,We have to save Mr. Porter's van before it sinks into the bay.
00:05:39.422,00:05:41.049,We have to save the food.
00:05:41.132,00:05:42.717,"I mean, the van."
00:05:48.473,00:05:52.352,"Chase, I'll need you and your winch to help pull the van out of the ice."
00:05:56.522,00:06:01.652,"Zuma, I'll need you to ride your hovercraft out with me to hook the winch onto the van."
00:06:02.445,00:06:03.946,"Ready when you are, Ryder!"
00:06:04.030,00:06:06.991,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:07:02.547,00:07:04.424,"Hi, Ryder! Hi, pups!"
00:07:06.217,00:07:07.468,"Ryder, Ryder!"
00:07:07.552,00:07:11.055,All your pups' food and treats and everything are still in the van!
00:07:14.642,00:07:15.601,Oh yeah.
00:07:16.394,00:07:19.397,"Well, I can't imagine how Ryder can fix this."
00:07:19.897,00:07:23.818,"If I attach the winch hook to the van, Chase can pull it to shore."
00:07:23.901,00:07:26.737,But how will you get out there? The ice isn't solid.
00:07:26.821,00:07:30.867,Zuma has a hovercraft and my ATV can transform into one.
00:07:30.950,00:07:34.078,"They float above the ice and water, not on it."
00:07:34.162,00:07:35.538,"Chase, you're on!"
00:07:35.621,00:07:36.789,"You got it, Ryder!"
00:07:47.341,00:07:49.385,"-Ready, Zuma? -You bet!"
00:08:08.738,00:08:11.282,Whoa. Check out all those cracks.
00:08:11.365,00:08:13.367,The ice is really thin.
00:08:13.451,00:08:15.912,Good thing the water's not too deep here.
00:08:19.624,00:08:21.417,I'll hook this to the bumper.
00:08:24.587,00:08:26.005,"Careful, Ryder."
00:08:31.469,00:08:32.720,That looks scary.
00:08:32.803,00:08:33.930,And dangerous.
00:08:34.013,00:08:37.600,Good thing Ryder and Zuma have trained for just this sort of job.
00:08:44.524,00:08:46.567,This ice won't hold for long.
00:08:47.443,00:08:48.694,It's all hooked up.
00:08:49.904,00:08:51.447,"Ryder, look out!"
00:08:52.114,00:08:54.992,Uh-oh. I better get off this ice.
00:08:55.493,00:08:56.953,Whoa! Whoa!
00:09:08.464,00:09:11.175,Oh no! The ice cracked under Ryder!
00:09:11.259,00:09:13.719,How will he get to his ATV?
00:09:15.846,00:09:18.683,"If I jump, I'll fall in the bay."
00:09:20.351,00:09:21.936,"Zuma, your buoy!"
00:09:28.734,00:09:31.696,"Zuma, you're going to get me back to my hovercraft."
00:09:31.779,00:09:34.824,-How? -Back up very slowly.
00:09:36.701,00:09:39.453,"Ryder, dude, you're ice boarding!"
00:09:42.206,00:09:44.292,"Hang on, almost there!"
00:09:44.875,00:09:46.919,Whoa!
00:09:47.003,00:09:48.170,Faster!
00:09:48.254,00:09:49.589,Whoa!
00:09:56.012,00:09:58.139,Whoo-hoo! Nice boarding.
00:09:59.140,00:10:01.684,Now let's get back to shore before we get soaked.
00:10:04.854,00:10:07.023,Let's go save that van!
00:10:12.111,00:10:15.990,That was awesome! I'm so happy you're okay.
00:10:16.073,00:10:17.283,"Thanks, Alex."
00:10:29.795,00:10:31.464,My van looks okay!
00:10:34.133,00:10:35.551,And the pup treats are safe.
00:10:35.635,00:10:37.511,Thanks to the PAW Patrol.
00:10:37.595,00:10:39.305,-Hip-hip… -Hooray!
00:10:43.809,00:10:44.769,"Thanks, Alex."
00:10:45.561,00:10:47.396,"And thanks again, Ryder."
00:10:53.903,00:10:55.321,You pups were great today.
00:10:55.404,00:11:04.038,You all deserve… Here you go!
00:11:25.935,00:11:32.441,"Mr. Porter-- Excuse me. But my tummy just wanted to say, Thank you."
00:00:50.800,00:00:52.719,-And pink! -Yes!
00:00:55.346,00:00:59.309,"Wow, Chase. No one can sniff out treats like you."
00:01:04.481,00:01:05.982,Wet dog?
00:01:09.235,00:01:13.448,Are you pups practicing for Mayor Goodway's awesome annual Easter egg hunt?
00:01:13.531,00:01:14.532,Oh yeah!
00:01:23.374,00:01:25.043,Egg alert! Hollow log!
00:01:25.126,00:01:26.628,"Go, go, go!"
00:01:34.552,00:01:36.429,Practice egg has been found.
00:01:38.348,00:01:40.600,Egg alert! Behind Zuma's bowl!
00:01:42.769,00:01:43.770,Got it!
00:01:43.853,00:01:45.939,"Eggcellent egg spotting, Skye."
00:01:50.318,00:01:52.862,Egg alert! Under the boardwalk!
00:01:58.827,00:02:00.328,"Hey, you're not an egg."
00:02:04.124,00:02:06.918,you pups will have a great time at the Easter egg hunt.
00:02:07.001,00:02:10.922,Coming through! Look at all the eggs I can carry.
00:02:11.005,00:02:12.382,Whoa! Whoa!
00:02:13.842,00:02:15.218,Whoa!
00:02:16.886,00:02:18.471,Uh-oh!
00:02:19.430,00:02:23.351,"You know, Marshall, Easter eggs are usually hard boiled."
00:02:32.944,00:02:37.824,"Alex, are you ready for the biggest, most awesome Easter egg hunt you've ever seen?"
00:02:37.907,00:02:40.493,Yeah! I love Easter egg hunts!
00:02:49.252,00:02:51.296,Whoa!
00:02:53.173,00:02:54.007,Ouchie.
00:02:58.595,00:03:01.723,just follow the bouncing bunnies on the screen.
00:03:13.443,00:03:14.402,We're getting it.
00:03:20.825,00:03:22.035,"Hop, hop-- whoa!"
00:03:28.917,00:03:32.086,On your mark… get set… go!
00:03:37.175,00:03:38.551,"Oh, sorry, Mayor."
00:03:38.635,00:03:39.844,Ryder here.
00:03:44.974,00:03:46.434,"I'm sorry, Mayor Goodway."
00:03:47.185,00:03:52.482,I haven't finished dying the eggs… or hiding the goodies.
00:03:52.565,00:03:56.069,"If I can't finish, the Easter egg hunt will never be ready in time."
00:03:56.152,00:03:59.405,Poor Chickaletta's heart will be broken.
00:04:00.990,00:04:03.826,"We'll help get the Easter egg hunt ready, Mayor Goodway."
00:04:03.910,00:04:06.955,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:04:07.038,00:04:09.415,"-Thank you, Ryder. -Hurry!"
00:04:13.378,00:04:15.004,"Hop, hop-- Ryder!"
00:04:15.088,00:04:16.297,"Hop, hop, Ryder?"
00:04:19.550,00:04:20.802,Ryder needs us!
00:04:20.885,00:04:22.011,Let's hop to it!
00:04:25.348,00:04:26.557,Wait up!
00:04:49.414,00:04:51.374,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:04:51.457,00:04:56.963,"Sorry to interrupt your bunny hopping, pups, but some problems have come up with the Easter egg hunt."
00:04:57.046,00:04:59.674,Uh-oh. Troubles with treats?
00:05:01.050,00:05:05.680,-Ooh! -Mayor Goodway hurt her arm and can't decorate or hide the eggs in time.
00:05:05.763,00:05:08.516,All the kids in town will be totally bummed.
00:05:08.599,00:05:11.978,The good news is we can help! We're going to color and hide the eggs.
00:05:12.061,00:05:13.896,-Yeah! Awesome! -I wanna help!
00:05:17.400,00:05:22.572,"…Rubble, I need you and your rig to bring more eggs from Farmer Yumi's to City Hall."
00:05:22.655,00:05:24.907,Rubble on the double.
00:05:26.534,00:05:28.453,"Next, I'll need Rocky."
00:05:36.044,00:05:40.340,"Marshall, I need you and your water cannons to decorate the eggs fast."
00:05:54.645,00:05:56.064,Is on the case!
00:06:02.070,00:06:03.529,It's all pups on deck.
00:06:03.613,00:06:06.574,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:07:14.725,00:07:18.146,"Glad to help, Mayor Bunny-- Uh, Goodway."
00:07:24.485,00:07:26.612,That's a lot of Easter eggs.
00:07:29.115,00:07:31.075,"Come on, guys. Let's do this."
00:07:34.328,00:07:35.955,"Whoa, Farmer Yumi."
00:07:37.957,00:07:42.920,"My chickens have been getting ready for Easter day and night, and boy, are they tired."
00:07:56.225,00:07:58.686,They'd really be fun at the Easter egg hunt.
00:07:58.769,00:08:00.897,But how would you even get them there?
00:08:00.980,00:08:15.661,"Hmm… Very nice, Zuma."
00:08:15.745,00:08:16.829,Thanks.
00:08:26.631,00:08:28.174,"Nice egg, Rocky!"
00:08:44.065,00:08:46.817,One egg. Only a gazillion more to go.
00:08:55.117,00:08:58.538,Maybe that basket is too big. What if we can't fill it up?
00:09:11.133,00:09:12.301,Almost ready.
00:09:14.720,00:09:16.597,"Okay, Marshall, fire away!"
00:09:21.018,00:09:22.562,No!
00:09:27.358,00:09:30.111,Pink and yellow don't work for this fellow.
00:10:08.941,00:10:11.777,"You sing, dance, and paint!"
00:10:11.861,00:10:14.363,You are the most talented pups in the world!
00:10:23.414,00:10:24.874,I painted it myself.
00:10:24.957,00:10:28.419,"Alex, that's the biggest, best Easter egg ever!"
00:10:28.502,00:10:30.212,Super cool egg!
00:10:30.296,00:10:31.797,Can it go in the basket?
00:10:32.840,00:10:34.967,This egg will have a place of honor.
00:10:35.051,00:10:38.387,Whoa… That's one big egg.
00:10:43.934,00:10:45.895,Wow! It's an eagle!
00:10:45.978,00:10:47.063,"Hi, eagle!"
00:10:56.614,00:10:59.367,Oh no! My Easter basket!
00:10:59.450,00:11:01.577,Come back!
00:11:03.829,00:11:11.462,"Uh, excuse me, Miss Eagle, ma'am, uh, Mayor Goodway kind of wants this basket for the Easter egg hunt."
00:01:18.328,00:01:20.955,"Rubble, we need you to dig it out of the snow bank."
00:01:21.039,00:01:23.500,Then Rocky can lift it so we can take a look at the damage.
00:01:25.335,00:01:28.421,We'd better hurry or there's not gonna be a Christmas this year.
00:01:28.505,00:01:29.881,I'll get my truck.
00:01:34.010,00:01:36.387,Stand back! I'll dig it out!
00:01:45.063,00:01:46.606,"Nice work, Rubble!"
00:01:46.689,00:01:48.525,"Okay, Rocky. Take it up!"
00:01:56.658,00:01:58.743,"Okay, let's have a look."
00:02:05.416,00:02:06.835,Hang on!
00:02:14.634,00:02:16.511,We'll have to replace it.
00:02:16.594,00:02:18.304,See what you have on the truck.
00:02:18.388,00:02:24.936,Hmm… That must be where the magic Christmas Star goes.
00:02:25.019,00:02:26.855,This storm is getting worse.
00:02:26.938,00:02:28.773,We'd better fix this in a hurry.
00:02:38.032,00:02:39.284,I spotted a bag!
00:02:39.367,00:02:40.910,Looks like Santa's!
00:02:44.289,00:02:45.915,"Uh-uh, Marshall's on it."
00:02:51.629,00:02:52.714,I've got this one.
00:03:00.805,00:03:03.474,Whoa! Whoa!
00:03:19.324,00:03:22.285,I'm good. The presents are safe.
00:03:22.368,00:03:23.786,Let's find the rest.
00:03:27.373,00:03:30.585,I knew these old skis would come in handy someday.
00:03:39.469,00:03:41.054,"Whoo-hoo, Ryder!"
00:03:41.137,00:03:43.806,Check out all the presents we found. It's like Christmas.
00:03:46.976,00:03:49.687,Oh yeah. Good thing the gifts have names on them.
00:03:49.771,00:03:51.481,There's a lot to deliver.
00:03:51.564,00:03:55.235,"Okay, Skye, you and Marshall can drop gifts down chimneys."
00:03:55.318,00:03:57.946,"Zuma, you can deliver the gifts to Seal Island."
00:03:58.029,00:03:58.988,And hurry!
00:03:59.072,00:04:00.365,"You got it, Ryder!"
00:04:16.089,00:04:16.923,Huh?
00:04:19.592,00:04:21.386,How many reindeer are there again?
00:04:23.179,00:04:25.014,That's a lot of reindeer.
00:04:29.477,00:04:30.395,Tracks!
00:04:30.478,00:04:31.354,Huh?
00:04:33.606,00:04:36.067,"Bingo! Wait, that's not a reindeer."
00:04:36.150,00:04:38.278,"I mean, uh, Blitzen?"
00:04:39.821,00:04:43.408,Comet? Uh… come Donder! Cupid!
00:04:43.491,00:04:44.492,Vixen?
00:04:45.493,00:04:46.411,Prancer?
00:04:53.501,00:04:56.337,Santa needs to put tags on you guys.
00:05:04.971,00:05:05.888,Bull's-eye!
00:05:25.533,00:05:26.993,The storm's picking up again.
00:05:27.076,00:05:29.954,I hope Santa finds the magic star soon.
00:05:36.294,00:05:40.173,"Presents for Mayor Goodway. Well, here goes."
00:05:40.882,00:05:42.175,Whoa!
00:05:42.258,00:05:43.593,Oof!
00:05:44.844,00:05:46.137,Ow!
00:05:46.220,00:05:48.264,How does Santa do it?
00:05:58.691,00:06:00.693,"Don't wake up the mayor, okay?"
00:06:07.909,00:06:09.535,Merry Christmas.
00:06:19.170,00:06:21.255,Except for the magic Christmas Star.
00:06:21.339,00:06:23.925,"Without that star, the sleigh won't fly."
00:06:28.513,00:06:31.140,"Hi, Santa. It's Ryder. Good news."
00:06:36.854,00:06:40.149,You are all permanently on my Nice List.
00:06:40.233,00:06:44.362,But I still haven't found the magic Christmas Star.
00:06:44.445,00:06:48.199,"And if I don't find it, well, Christmas will be ruined."
00:06:50.910,00:06:56.124,"If he doesn't find the star, there'll be a lot of disappointed boys and girls tomorrow."
00:06:56.207,00:06:57.667,And pups.
00:06:57.750,00:07:00.962,Hmm… Wait! I have an idea!
00:07:15.643,00:07:16.936,Let's roll!
00:07:27.447,00:07:31.117,Hope I make it to Cap'n Turbot's before that storm comes back.
00:07:33.411,00:07:34.454,Huh?
00:07:49.093,00:07:52.138,"Wally, I have to get to the island before I get snowed in."
00:07:57.143,00:08:00.313,Please? I have to deliver these presents.
00:08:02.190,00:08:05.151,"Oh, I get it. Hang on."
00:08:22.502,00:08:24.879,It must have landed around here somewhere.
00:08:29.842,00:08:32.512,Maybe Bettina saw it! Where is she?
00:08:40.436,00:08:42.897,It's making her fly like a reindeer!
00:08:53.366,00:08:55.910,Fresh hay! Come and get it!
00:09:06.879,00:09:08.297,We got it!
00:09:08.381,00:09:09.549,I'll call Santa.
00:09:09.632,00:09:12.051,I hope it's not too late to save Christmas.
00:09:23.229,00:09:24.730,"Bye, Santa."
00:09:26.774,00:09:28.109,Santa's on his way.
00:09:28.192,00:09:30.278,We're gonna meet Santa?
00:09:35.283,00:09:37.159,Santa will need his reindeer.
00:09:41.831,00:09:44.041,"Not that way, this way."
00:09:47.253,00:09:50.339,"How about a little Christmas cooperation here, gang?"
00:09:50.423,00:09:51.591,That's better.
00:09:52.091,00:09:54.468,"Oh no, not again."
00:09:57.555,00:09:59.390,Attention all reindeer!
00:10:00.933,00:10:01.934,Very good.
00:10:02.018,00:10:05.146,Now please move forward in an orderly fashion.
00:10:07.315,00:10:08.691,Now that's more like it.
00:10:11.777,00:10:13.321,Wait for me!
00:10:13.404,00:10:14.488,Guys?
00:10:16.824,00:10:19.285,"Ryder, my sleigh looks perfect!"
00:10:24.123,00:10:26.959,"Ho, ho, ho, ho! The magic star!"
00:10:35.509,00:10:37.720,"I don't know how to thank you, Ryder."
00:10:43.976,00:10:45.561,"Anytime, Santa."
00:10:45.645,00:10:49.023,"Whenever you're in trouble, just ho, ho, ho for help."
00:10:56.280,00:10:57.823,It's so beautiful.
00:10:57.907,00:11:00.242,I've always wanted to sit here!
00:11:14.340,00:11:15.424,"Ho, ho, ho!"
00:11:15.508,00:11:18.969,"The reindeer always go when they hear dash away, all."
00:11:21.972,00:11:23.683,-Whoo-hoo! -Wee!
00:11:47.415,00:11:50.668,"Ho, ho, ho! It sure looked like you pups had fun!"
00:11:50.751,00:11:52.628,But now I need to get a move on.
00:11:52.712,00:11:54.130,I'm behind schedule!
00:11:54.213,00:11:57.800,"Dash away, all! Ho, ho, ho!"
00:11:57.883,00:11:58.801,"Ho, ho, ho!"
00:12:01.345,00:12:06.016,"Merry Christmas, PAW Patrol, and thank you!"
00:12:10.312,00:12:13.482,I guess Santa didn't have time to bring our presents.
00:12:13.566,00:12:17.236,Presents? Who needs presents? I got to be a Santa pup.
00:12:17.319,00:12:19.864,Yeah! I got to ride on Santa's sleigh!
00:12:19.947,00:12:23.200,"And we got to meet the big, jolly dude himself."
00:12:23.284,00:12:25.786,And saved Christmas for the whole world!
00:12:25.870,00:12:28.414,This is the best Christmas ever.
00:12:31.500,00:12:35.629,"Now, let's get some sleep. It's almost Christmas morning."
00:12:42.136,00:12:44.305,"Come on, Ryder. It's Christmas."
00:12:44.388,00:12:45.306,Look! Look!
00:12:49.769,00:12:51.187,-Can we open them? -Can we?
00:12:53.439,00:12:54.690,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:12:54.774,00:12:56.066,Ryder first.
00:12:56.150,00:12:57.401,-Okay. -Yeah!
00:12:57.485,00:12:59.528,"-Ryder first. -Yeah, Ryder first!"
00:13:00.070,00:13:02.031,We picked it out just for you.
00:13:05.159,00:13:07.369,Aw… It's perfect.
00:13:07.453,00:13:10.289,"-Mmm, that looks great. -Wow, I wish I could have that."
00:13:10.372,00:13:16.337,"-Mmm, smells great. -Tell you what, pups, you have it. Merry Christmas."
00:00:54.721,00:00:55.555,Huh?
00:00:56.306,00:00:57.265,Turtle?
00:01:04.773,00:01:06.816,Oh! Ah! Oh!
00:01:19.287,00:01:21.414,Where are you going?
00:01:30.006,00:01:33.510,"More turtles? Huh, I found one in my juice glass."
00:01:35.470,00:01:36.971,They're everywhere.
00:01:38.556,00:01:39.974,They're so cute!
00:01:46.731,00:01:49.150,-Gertle! -Churtle and Wurtle.
00:01:49.234,00:01:50.318,Joey!
00:01:57.158,00:01:59.119,This one has a star on her back.
00:02:02.789,00:02:04.541,Star wants some water.
00:02:06.960,00:02:08.962,Turtles need water to live.
00:02:09.045,00:02:12.799,I better figure out where they came from so we can get them back home.
00:02:14.759,00:02:16.427,Can't they stay here?
00:02:16.511,00:02:22.016,"These turtles need to live near a lot of water, like a pond or a river, not a dog bowl."
00:02:25.311,00:02:28.022,"Rocky, make a safe place to gather the turtles."
00:02:32.902,00:02:34.988,That should keep them in one place!
00:02:38.366,00:02:43.204,"There's Myrtle, Gertle… Burtle, Joey… Where are the rest?"
00:02:46.541,00:02:49.043,Emergency! The turtles have escaped!
00:02:49.127,00:02:53.256,"I repeat, the turtles have-- Turtle express, coming through!"
00:02:56.467,00:02:58.970,"They're slow, but they get around."
00:03:01.055,00:03:01.890,Rocky?
00:03:01.973,00:03:04.267,"Uh, what's up with your hat?"
00:03:05.310,00:03:06.603,Whoa!
00:03:40.261,00:03:44.057,"Now, if I was a freshwater turtle, where would I live?"
00:03:46.935,00:04:00.657,"Either that's one giant turtle, or… Farmer Yumi's pond is all dried up!"
00:04:00.740,00:04:02.367,No wonder you left home.
00:04:02.450,00:04:04.202,We need to fix up your pond!
00:04:04.285,00:04:07.121,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:04:08.998,00:04:11.000,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:04:13.544,00:04:16.214,"Ugh, and I need a towel!"
00:04:23.972,00:04:26.391,"Marshall, why so slow?"
00:04:26.474,00:04:27.725,Shh!
00:04:30.895,00:04:32.313,Aw!
00:04:51.124,00:04:53.126,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:04:53.209,00:04:56.921,"Marshall, why are you moving so slowly?"
00:04:57.005,00:05:00.425,"If I move at turtle speed, I won't wake her up."
00:05:03.344,00:05:05.930,"Okay, pups… and Star."
00:05:06.014,00:05:08.016,I figured out why the turtles are here.
00:05:09.392,00:05:14.272,"Their pond is all dried up, and they're looking for someplace wet to stay cool."
00:05:14.814,00:05:15.648,Huh?
00:05:16.733,00:05:18.484,I wonder what's wrong.
00:05:19.610,00:05:20.695,Hmm.
00:05:28.494,00:05:31.622,"First, we need to figure out why there's no water in the pond."
00:05:33.291,00:05:36.294,"Rubble, I'll need you and your digger to help clear it."
00:05:36.377,00:05:37.837,Let's dig it!
00:06:41.734,00:06:43.528,Need any help with the turtles?
00:06:43.611,00:06:45.321,"No thanks, they're not heavy."
00:06:48.950,00:06:52.495,"In fact, they seem to be getting a lot lighter."
00:06:53.121,00:06:54.122,Uh-oh!
00:06:59.001,00:07:01.546,"Pups, the turtles have escaped again!"
00:07:02.505,00:07:05.216,"Uh, we're right here, dude."
00:07:06.801,00:07:08.636,Split up and find those turtles!
00:07:15.017,00:07:17.186,"Uh-oh, we're missing one!"
00:07:20.481,00:07:24.152,You think doing the Pup Pup Boogie will help you find the turtle?
00:07:26.821,00:07:29.282,It's Star! She really tickles!
00:07:30.950,00:07:32.660,These turtles love to play.
00:07:34.912,00:07:37.457,Maybe that's how we can keep them in one place.
00:07:39.709,00:07:44.464,There should be a spring or an underground stream that brings the water into the pond.
00:07:45.965,00:07:48.176,Hmm… Huh?
00:07:48.259,00:07:49.802,There's a puddle here!
00:07:50.636,00:07:51.721,Ah!
00:07:51.804,00:07:53.639,"What's wrong, Rubble?"
00:07:56.184,00:07:57.810,One's still here!
00:07:58.686,00:08:01.689,"Hmm, what's blocking the water?"
00:08:02.190,00:08:03.024,A-ha!
00:08:05.318,00:08:07.570,That should let the water into the pond again.
00:08:07.653,00:08:10.072,Rubble on the double!
00:08:31.636,00:08:32.887,"Go for it, Churtle!"
00:08:34.639,00:08:36.599,"Oh, sorry, Burtle!"
00:08:44.482,00:08:46.275,"Great dive, Star!"
00:08:49.529,00:08:50.363,Nothing yet!
00:08:50.446,00:08:52.073,I have to go deeper!
00:08:55.618,00:08:56.994,"You did it, Rubble!"
00:09:00.748,00:09:01.666,Whoa!
00:09:01.749,00:09:04.669,"I really did it, maybe too well."
00:09:04.752,00:09:07.046,"Uh-oh, you better get out of there!"
00:09:10.716,00:09:12.218,The digger won't start!
00:09:12.301,00:09:14.428,The water got in the engine!
00:09:19.517,00:09:21.894,I need you both at Yumi's pond right away!
00:10:01.017,00:10:02.893,"Chase, you're on!"
00:10:16.949,00:10:19.076,"All right, it's working!"
00:10:19.160,00:10:22.496,"Thanks, Chase and Zuma! You saved the day!"
00:10:24.165,00:10:26.000,"Now, let's get these turtles home."
00:10:28.085,00:10:30.379,"-Skye? -Hi, Ryder, what's up?"
00:10:31.547,00:10:33.341,The turtles can come back to the pond.
00:10:35.217,00:10:36.510,You're going home!
00:10:45.311,00:10:46.437,"Here we are, guys."
00:10:46.520,00:10:47.688,Home again!
00:10:48.606,00:10:51.233,"All right, turtles. Your home is good as new."
00:10:51.359,00:10:55.154,"Better, actually, thanks to this good bunch of pups."
00:11:01.535,00:11:03.746,"Have a good swim, Joey!"
00:11:29.021,00:11:31.899,Look. Star's saying Thank you!
00:11:31.982,00:00:48.757,"If the turtles ever need us again, they just have to… Ready?"
00:01:16.785,00:01:19.496,Cap'n Turbot's got four feet?
00:01:19.579,00:01:22.207,"Whoa, I think I'm seeing double."
00:01:26.294,00:01:28.088,This is my cousin from France!
00:01:32.383,00:01:35.220,"François, this is Ryder, Marshall, and Chase."
00:01:35.303,00:01:36.221,-Hi! -Hello!
00:01:39.641,00:01:42.602,Tur-bow? I thought you were cousins.
00:01:42.685,00:01:46.481,"We are, but Horatio here pronounces the family name wrong."
00:01:46.564,00:01:48.316,Your name's Horatio?
00:01:48.399,00:01:50.151,A noble naval name!
00:01:52.320,00:01:55.657,The only thing better than football is volleyball!
00:02:04.582,00:02:06.668,Wow! Nice shot.
00:02:10.171,00:02:12.632,"Thanks, you're pretty good yourself."
00:02:12.715,00:02:16.094,"Well, yes, I am very good. It is true."
00:02:16.177,00:02:17.512,They can keep him busy.
00:02:19.931,00:02:23.017,I think I saw a blue-footed booby bird down by the bay.
00:02:23.101,00:02:25.145,They almost never come this farup the coast!
00:02:25.228,00:02:29.691,"If I get a picture, it might make the cover of Marine Bird Monthly!"
00:02:29.774,00:02:31.276,"Wow, good luck!"
00:02:39.909,00:02:41.286,"Can't play today, Wally."
00:02:41.369,00:02:44.080,I've got to find a blue-footed booby bird!
00:02:46.791,00:02:49.419,Look at me! Look at me!
00:03:00.930,00:03:03.266,And isn't it fun to hear his accent?
00:03:15.028,00:03:18.031,"Wow, did you see what François just did?"
00:03:33.087,00:03:35.173,"Sorry, Wally. Fresh out of fish."
00:03:36.299,00:03:37.175,Huh?
00:03:38.968,00:03:40.345,"Oh, there it is!"
00:03:40.428,00:03:43.097,A blue-footed booby bird! On my boat!
00:03:46.351,00:03:48.186,Uh-oh! Come back!
00:03:48.269,00:03:50.230,Hold still! Say cheese!
00:03:50.313,00:03:51.314,Whoa!
00:03:58.196,00:04:00.031,Oh no! Come back!
00:04:06.871,00:04:08.289,Good boy! Go get him!
00:04:14.671,00:04:15.588,"Hi, Wally."
00:04:15.672,00:04:16.798,What's wrong?
00:04:18.174,00:04:19.801,It's Cap'n Turbot?
00:04:20.551,00:04:30.645,He found his bird… No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:04:30.728,00:04:31.562,We're on it!
00:04:34.816,00:04:36.734,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:04:54.002,00:04:55.336,Ooh la la!
00:05:13.021,00:05:14.939,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:05:16.357,00:05:18.067,"Thanks for hurrying, pups."
00:05:18.151,00:05:19.819,Cap'n Turbot needs us!
00:05:24.991,00:05:27.452,We need to get him back on board and help him get his picture.
00:05:28.786,00:05:34.125,"Zuma, I need you to zip out and use your buoy to rescue Cap'n Turbot and get him back to his boat."
00:05:34.208,00:05:35.668,Let's dive in!
00:05:36.753,00:05:41.507,"Skye, I need you to fly along the shore and search for the booby bird's nest with your goggles."
00:05:45.553,00:05:47.472,PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:07:05.258,00:07:07.385,Zuma will get you. I'll get your boat!
00:07:07.468,00:07:08.719,"Thanks, Ryder!"
00:07:16.018,00:07:17.770,Yay!
00:07:38.207,00:07:39.333,Made it!
00:07:47.842,00:07:49.051,Phew!
00:07:49.135,00:07:52.305,"It's good to be back on solid, uh, boat."
00:07:52.388,00:07:54.348,"Now, we'll help you get pictures of that bird."
00:07:56.809,00:07:59.562,It's odd for this feathered fowl to fly this far from home.
00:08:04.358,00:08:05.610,Uh-oh.
00:08:09.614,00:08:13.242,"Okay, Horatio, where is this bird you need me to take a picture of, huh?"
00:08:16.037,00:08:18.998,I will photograph the blue foot against the white rock.
00:08:20.208,00:08:22.877,"Sail on, Horatio! Sail on!"
00:08:33.387,00:08:36.516,It shouldn't be hard to spot those bright blue feet!
00:08:39.393,00:08:40.645,That's it!
00:08:43.439,00:08:45.358,"Good news, Cap'n Turbot!"
00:08:47.235,00:08:48.569,"Bingo, you found it!"
00:08:48.653,00:08:50.863,We need to approach it very slowly.
00:08:50.947,00:08:53.533,Blue-footed booby birds are basically bashful.
00:08:56.953,00:08:58.204,Excuse me!
00:08:58.287,00:09:00.998,"I will get the photo for you, Horatio!"
00:09:13.511,00:09:14.679,"Ah, the bird!"
00:09:20.142,00:09:24.188,"Okay, my little bleu-footed friend, say bleu cheese!"
00:09:25.940,00:09:27.400,Mad booby bird!
00:09:27.483,00:09:29.944,Mad booby bird! Ah!
00:09:40.454,00:09:42.081,François needs our help!
00:09:42.164,00:09:44.250,Help!
00:09:50.089,00:09:52.633,"Hang on, François! Help is here!"
00:09:54.135,00:09:56.095,This is one angry booby bird!
00:10:03.144,00:10:06.606,Help! Help!
00:10:09.692,00:10:12.361,"Ah! Oh, thank you!"
00:10:12.445,00:10:14.238,Thank you. Thank you.
00:10:16.407,00:10:17.658,"Phew, close call!"
00:10:20.494,00:10:23.164,"Hi there, you beautiful blue-footed birdy."
00:10:23.247,00:10:25.166,May I please take your picture?
00:10:40.264,00:10:41.515,No problem!
00:10:41.599,00:10:43.768,"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!"
00:10:45.102,00:10:48.147,"I never got you a picture of your bird, Horatio."
00:10:48.230,00:10:52.026,That's okay! Cap'n Turbot got some perfect pictures.
00:10:52.109,00:10:56.405,"As we learn more about the booby bird's habits, maybe more of them will want to nest here."
00:10:57.907,00:10:59.200,"Oh, no, no, no!"
00:11:11.712,00:11:12.797,"Thanks, Cap'n!"
00:11:21.013,00:11:23.557,"Ah, you go first, Horatio."
00:11:23.641,00:11:25.935,"No, you go, François."
00:11:27.144,00:11:28.521,Ah!
00:11:28.604,00:11:30.189,Look at me! Look at me!
00:00:49.132,00:00:50.717,"Hey, Ryder. What's up?"
00:00:50.800,00:00:53.553,"Hey, Rocky. I'm tuning up my ATV."
00:00:53.636,00:00:55.764,Need a pup to lend you a paw?
00:00:55.847,00:00:59.642,"I'd love some help. Could you grab me a pair of pliers, please?"
00:01:08.651,00:01:09.903,"Thanks, Rocky."
00:01:14.407,00:01:17.786,Keeping track of how many whales are in Adventure Bay sure is tough.
00:01:23.792,00:01:24.751,"Oh, here it is."
00:01:29.798,00:01:32.509,"Ooh, that doesn't sound like a whale."
00:01:34.552,00:01:35.720,Uh-oh!
00:01:45.105,00:01:46.397,Are you all right?
00:01:46.481,00:01:48.942,"I'm okay, but I think I hit a rock."
00:01:51.861,00:01:55.323,Don't worry! I know who to call!
00:02:05.416,00:02:06.334,Pup Pad.
00:02:06.417,00:02:07.836,Pup Pad.
00:02:15.051,00:02:17.428,A boat ran into the rocks. It's leaking oil!
00:02:17.512,00:02:20.640,Oil? That's really bad for the animals in the bay.
00:02:25.520,00:02:28.648,It can make them really sick. Uh-oh.
00:02:29.941,00:02:32.068,Some whales headed this way!
00:02:36.614,00:02:38.491,Stay back!
00:02:51.379,00:02:54.215,"This is terrible, really terrible."
00:02:54.299,00:02:55.758,"We're on our way, Cap'n!"
00:03:00.305,00:03:02.682,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:03:03.683,00:03:07.228,Mm-mmm! I can hardly wait to try this new pup food.
00:03:14.485,00:03:16.070,Here I come!
00:03:19.574,00:03:21.159,"Marshall, you okay?"
00:03:21.242,00:03:24.537,Mmm! Does this new pup food have extra cheese?
00:03:25.955,00:03:26.915,Let's go!
00:03:28.082,00:03:29.083,Mmm.
00:03:33.087,00:03:34.130,Yeah!
00:04:01.074,00:04:03.868,Adventure Bay has a big emergency.
00:04:03.952,00:04:06.412,A boat is spilling oil into the bay.
00:04:11.417,00:04:14.087,A baby whale already swam through the spill.
00:04:19.008,00:04:21.177,and make it hard for it to eat and breathe.
00:04:21.261,00:04:25.974,We need a rescue team out there to clean up the whale and the water… fast.
00:04:27.267,00:04:30.478,"Zuma, I'll need you and your hovercraft to help stop the spill."
00:04:33.398,00:04:37.151,"Marshall, I need you and your fire hose to clean off the baby whale."
00:04:37.235,00:04:38.653,I'll ask Katie to help.
00:04:38.736,00:04:40.280,I'm fired up!
00:04:40.363,00:04:42.782,This job might need a lot of helping paws.
00:04:42.865,00:04:45.034,The rest of you pups standby.
00:04:45.118,00:04:46.035,-Sure thing. -Yeah!
00:04:46.119,00:04:47.161,Count on us.
00:04:47.245,00:04:50.206,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:05:04.012,00:05:05.972,Whoa!
00:06:13.998,00:06:14.874,"Hi, Katie."
00:06:14.957,00:06:16.042,Thanks for helping.
00:06:16.125,00:06:17.377,"No problem, Marshall."
00:06:17.460,00:06:20.463,I brought special soap to wash the oil off the baby whale.
00:06:39.941,00:06:43.820,"The sooner we plug the hole, the less oil we'll have to clean up."
00:06:43.903,00:06:46.239,And we need to wash off the little whale.
00:06:46.322,00:06:51.744,"Do you have anything I could use to plug the hole and keep the oil from spilling, Captain?"
00:06:51.828,00:06:53.079,How about this?
00:06:56.999,00:06:58.000,Perfect!
00:07:00.586,00:07:04.632,"That will stop the oil leak, until you can get to a dock and fix it properly."
00:07:04.715,00:07:05.800,"Thanks, Ryder!"
00:07:05.883,00:07:07.135,No problem.
00:07:08.010,00:07:10.263,Now it's time to clean up the baby whale.
00:07:10.888,00:07:12.223,"Have you seen her, Cap'n?"
00:07:15.184,00:07:19.647,"We need to get that whale to the beach, so Marshall and Katie can clean her off."
00:07:19.730,00:07:21.983,You have anything we can lure the whales with?
00:07:24.235,00:07:26.821,"Great! Zuma, your buoy."
00:07:31.868,00:07:37.498,"Cap'n, if you load up Zuma with some fish, the little whale might just follow him to shore!"
00:07:51.637,00:07:53.347,I think it's working.
00:07:53.931,00:07:55.349,Come and get it!
00:08:02.732,00:08:05.443,I brought a whale of a cleaning job.
00:08:18.164,00:08:21.876,This is special soap to get the oil off without hurting your skin.
00:08:21.959,00:08:24.170,Don't worry. It feels good.
00:08:32.428,00:08:35.556,Now we need something to keep this oil from spreading.
00:08:38.643,00:08:41.854,Hmm… We'll have to make something.
00:08:43.940,00:08:46.901,"-Rocky. -Hey, Ryder. What do you need?"
00:08:50.863,00:08:51.989,"Sure thing, Ryder."
00:08:52.073,00:08:54.408,Meet me at the dock with whatever you find.
00:09:01.207,00:09:03.793,"Wow, Rocky. You got a ton of towels."
00:09:05.836,00:09:09.840,All the pups worked together. We have to save Adventure Bay.
00:09:13.719,00:09:18.808,"That'll make a kind of big mop to drag across the water and pick up all the oil, like this."
00:09:18.891,00:09:20.476,See the way it soaks up water?
00:09:20.560,00:09:22.436,We can do the same with our towel boom.
00:09:23.896,00:09:26.148,But that's going to be a lot of towel tying.
00:09:26.232,00:09:27.900,Good thing we have the right tools.
00:09:31.696,00:09:33.322,"Good idea, Rocky."
00:09:49.505,00:09:52.967,We've soaked up most of the oil before it got on any more animals.
00:09:58.139,00:10:03.102,Okay. And now… Hose!
00:10:08.566,00:10:09.567,Whoa!
00:10:09.650,00:10:11.527,Oh! Ow! Oh! Ee! Ow!
00:10:14.739,00:10:16.532,I guess I needed a rinse too.
00:10:18.284,00:10:20.036,Now you're all safe and clean.
00:10:21.203,00:10:22.580,But I bet you miss your mommy.
00:10:48.648,00:10:50.232,"Glad we could help, Cap'n."
00:10:50.316,00:10:52.902,"Whenever there's trouble, just yelp for help."
00:11:02.161,00:11:03.996,"Hey, did you hear that?"
00:11:04.080,00:11:05.581,"Great job today, pups."
00:11:11.212,00:11:13.339,"Skye, you know what to do."
00:11:29.438,00:11:32.233,"Now that they're fed, let's get you pups all fed."
00:00:49.299,00:00:50.467,Not a goose.
00:00:55.013,00:00:57.849,"Nope, but I'm sure they'll be here soon."
00:01:00.477,00:01:05.356,The leaves from around the Lookout make a comfy nest for tired geese.
00:01:05.440,00:01:08.443,They'll be hungry too. This should fill their tummies.
00:01:25.293,00:01:26.795,What about those?
00:01:46.064,00:01:47.148,We heard.
00:02:24.686,00:02:25.520,I got him.
00:02:28.189,00:02:29.440,Whoa!
00:02:35.864,00:02:37.615,"Are you okay, fuzzy little guy?"
00:02:39.993,00:02:42.704,"Hey, Fuzzy's a great name for you."
00:02:42.787,00:02:44.372,"Back to your family, Fuzzy."
00:02:46.040,00:02:47.375,"Nice work, Marshall."
00:02:50.295,00:02:52.505,"Marshall, you have a new BGFF."
00:02:53.923,00:02:55.800,Best Goose Friend Forever.
00:02:59.345,00:03:00.638,Whoa!
00:03:14.194,00:03:15.987,"Oh, sorry, Fuzzy."
00:03:31.920,00:03:33.630,Mmm.
00:03:35.215,00:03:38.384,"Okay, Fuzzy, time to hit the hay or nest."
00:03:40.220,00:03:43.056,I suppose I could sleep out here with you guys.
00:03:44.599,00:03:46.601,"Okay, but just this once."
00:04:11.000,00:04:12.794,"Goodbye, geese."
00:04:12.877,00:04:14.337,Guess it's time to go.
00:04:14.420,00:04:16.172,We'll sure miss you around here.
00:04:22.887,00:04:23.888,Fuzzy?
00:04:23.972,00:04:25.765,Where did he go?
00:04:27.100,00:04:28.726,Fuzzy is gone.
00:04:28.810,00:04:31.271,We have to find him before his flock leaves.
00:04:31.354,00:04:32.647,Fuzzy is missing?
00:04:32.730,00:04:35.942,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:04:36.985,00:04:38.903,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout."
00:04:45.952,00:04:47.078,"Morning, Rubble."
00:04:47.161,00:04:48.705,Excuse me.
00:04:48.788,00:04:51.207,Can someone please turn on the lights?
00:05:03.344,00:05:04.387,Whoa!
00:05:22.363,00:05:24.324,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:05:24.407,00:05:27.952,"Pups, we have an emergency in our own backyard."
00:05:28.036,00:05:31.164,Our geese friends have to migrate with the rest of their flock.
00:05:36.044,00:05:39.547,"If we don't find him fast, they'll have to leave him behind."
00:05:45.428,00:05:47.597,Chase is on the case.
00:05:54.437,00:05:55.980,I'm fired up.
00:06:14.040,00:06:15.458,Whoa!
00:06:46.864,00:06:49.075,"Chase, use your megaphone to make a goose call."
00:06:51.953,00:06:54.038,Fuzzy doesn't seem to be responding.
00:07:08.928,00:07:10.471,He went this way.
00:07:31.701,00:07:32.869,He went this way.
00:07:49.844,00:07:51.262,"Hey, there, little goose."
00:07:51.345,00:07:53.264,Would you like this piece of bread?
00:08:33.012,00:08:34.972,"Fuzzy, fly down here."
00:08:35.515,00:08:36.349,He can't.
00:08:36.432,00:08:39.477,That plastic soda can ring is wrapped around his wing.
00:08:44.815,00:08:46.442,I'm fired up.
00:08:52.073,00:08:53.908,Back away from the bread.
00:09:02.416,00:09:03.376,No!
00:09:07.755,00:09:10.466,"Oh, yes! Sweet catch, Marshall."
00:09:11.467,00:09:13.511,"Now, let's get this off you."
00:09:22.311,00:09:23.229,I'm good.
00:09:25.648,00:09:27.858,"Fuzzy, there goes your flock."
00:09:27.942,00:09:30.236,You need to catch up with them.
00:09:34.907,00:09:38.286,"And when you migrate back south, you'll see us again."
00:09:43.457,00:09:46.752,Go ahead. Just keep flapping and you'll catch up.
00:09:50.715,00:09:51.757,"Bye, Fuzzy."
00:09:58.639,00:10:00.349,I don't think he wants to go.
00:10:00.433,00:10:03.269,"If he doesn't leave now, he'll never catch up."
00:10:06.522,00:10:07.690,What can we do?
00:10:11.402,00:10:13.988,Promise not to take this thing too high.
00:10:14.071,00:10:16.157,"Like, higher than my nose."
00:10:16.240,00:10:18.993,"Marshall, you aren't afraid of heights."
00:10:22.663,00:10:23.664,Okay.
00:10:24.707,00:10:26.792,Let's take to the sky!
00:10:39.597,00:10:42.516,"Come on, Fuzzy. Time to fly."
00:10:42.600,00:10:43.976,"Flap, flap."
00:10:45.686,00:10:47.938,"That's it, Fuzzy. You got it."
00:10:50.941,00:10:53.694,"Whenever you're in trouble, just honk for help."
00:11:15.883,00:11:18.260,You guys did an awesome job today.
00:11:18.344,00:11:19.929,What a bunch of good pups.
00:11:26.060,00:11:27.269,I'm doing it.
00:11:30.022,00:11:31.232,Chickaletta?
00:11:34.527,00:11:37.321,"Wow. Birds really do like you, Marshall."
00:01:05.565,00:01:07.692,She's doing the Cluck-Cluck Boogie.
00:01:11.112,00:01:12.697,And spin!
00:01:16.326,00:01:17.619,Whoa! Whoa!
00:01:38.598,00:01:41.768,Chickaletta! Why did you run off?
00:01:46.147,00:01:50.652,"Hello, Adventure Bay is doing an episode on me and my purse chicken."
00:01:51.778,00:01:54.030,The TV show? Are you nervous?
00:02:04.124,00:02:11.089,"This is Adventure Bay's first mayor, my great-grandfather, Grover Goodway."
00:02:16.678,00:02:19.264,I will not be seen with a statue with dirty pants.
00:02:29.816,00:02:34.821,As Chickaletta and I were saying… Chickaletta?
00:02:35.697,00:02:36.906,Chickaletta?
00:02:46.499,00:02:48.418,"Well, handbag, actually."
00:02:53.548,00:02:57.343,Ryder! My precious purse chicken has disappeared.
00:02:57.427,00:03:00.555,"Don't worry, Mayor. The PAW Patrol will find Chickaletta."
00:03:00.638,00:03:03.558,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:03:38.801,00:03:40.720,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:03:40.803,00:03:44.182,"Okay, PAW Patrol, we have an emergency at City Hall."
00:03:44.265,00:03:49.479,"Mayor Goodway was doing an interview for Hello, Adventure Bay, when Chickaletta ran away."
00:03:49.562,00:03:53.024,-Poor little chicky. -We've got to find her.
00:03:54.567,00:03:57.820,"Chase, I need you and your net in case we need to catch her."
00:03:57.904,00:03:59.989,Chase is on the case.
00:04:01.241,00:04:05.745,"Marshall, I need you and your ladder in case Chickaletta has gotten up somewhere high."
00:04:05.828,00:04:09.165,Ready for a ruff-ruff rescue!
00:04:09.249,00:04:12.210,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll.
00:05:17.317,00:05:19.235,Chickaletta!
00:05:24.282,00:05:26.075,"Oh, Ryder, you're here!"
00:05:26.743,00:05:29.912,"Don't worry, Mayor. PAW Patrol is on the case."
00:05:29.996,00:05:32.206,Chase just needs to get Chickaletta's scent.
00:05:32.290,00:05:36.461,"-Where does she like to hang out? -Um, she's a purse chicken."
00:05:36.544,00:05:38.963,She was always in my purse.
00:05:45.553,00:05:46.512,Huh?
00:06:41.150,00:06:42.151,That's Chickaletta!
00:06:42.735,00:06:46.155,"-Marshall, get your ladder. -Ruff-ruff rescue!"
00:06:56.707,00:06:58.292,Chickaletta!
00:06:59.001,00:07:00.837,"Good news, Mayor. We found her."
00:07:08.970,00:07:10.513,She can't eat pizza!
00:07:10.596,00:07:13.933,"Hi, Chickaletta. I'm just going to help you get down."
00:07:19.480,00:07:28.614,"Careful, Chickaletta! Come back!"
00:08:02.690,00:08:05.526,"Okay, she's around here someplace."
00:08:06.527,00:08:08.905,There she is! And there she is.
00:08:09.405,00:08:11.240,And there. Hmm.
00:08:18.831,00:08:20.958,Whoa! No!
00:08:27.548,00:08:28.633,"Listen up, chickens."
00:08:28.716,00:08:32.094,"If you normally live in a purse, please step forward."
00:08:36.182,00:08:39.143,"Oh, dear, there's a gazillion chickens here."
00:08:42.855,00:08:44.357,"Mayor, don't open the gate."
00:08:44.440,00:08:46.526,-Huh? -Whoa!
00:08:47.109,00:08:49.737,Oh no! They're getting out!
00:08:51.822,00:08:54.116,The bracelet. There's Chickaletta!
00:08:57.245,00:08:58.454,Follow that cow!
00:08:58.538,00:09:00.831,"Chase, use your net to round up the chickens."
00:09:37.660,00:09:40.204,"Careful, my precious."
00:09:42.915,00:09:44.792,"Marshall, we need your ladder."
00:09:44.875,00:09:46.669,No need for ladders.
00:09:46.752,00:09:50.298,"Come on, Chickaletta. Come to mama."
00:09:52.341,00:09:54.719,I got you!
00:09:54.802,00:09:56.012,"Chase, your net!"
00:09:57.430,00:09:59.265,Whoa!
00:10:01.434,00:10:02.727,"I've got you, Mayor."
00:10:05.813,00:10:08.441,Oh no! Chickaletta can't swim.
00:10:12.236,00:10:13.696,Let's dive in!
00:10:39.472,00:10:40.973,"Perfect, Zuma!"
00:10:48.689,00:10:51.067,"Whenever there's trouble, just yelp for help!"
00:10:55.404,00:10:57.114,"Action, comedy, drama."
00:11:04.997,00:11:07.958,You were super good pups today.
00:11:10.169,00:11:11.545,I want to see myself!
00:11:17.927,00:11:21.639,-I'm just gonna help you get down. -There's a gazillion chickens here!
00:11:24.350,00:11:26.811,Whoa!
00:11:33.818,00:11:35.945,Why can't all our adventures be on TV?
00:11:36.028,00:11:37.655,"You never know, Marshall."
00:01:02.854,00:01:05.815,I can't wait for Cap'n Turbot's ghost ship party.
00:01:08.234,00:01:10.487,It sounds super scary.
00:01:13.573,00:01:14.991,Ooh!
00:01:25.210,00:01:28.129,It's just Chase hanging up a Halloween decoration.
00:01:32.133,00:01:33.635,Coming through!
00:01:40.058,00:01:41.226,Whoa!
00:02:02.205,00:02:03.331,Got it!
00:02:03.414,00:02:04.582,Oh.
00:02:05.250,00:02:09.921,This goo in my 'do makes me blue.
00:02:18.429,00:02:22.809,So glad you could make it to my haunted ship Halloween party.
00:02:24.269,00:02:26.688,This is going to be so much fun.
00:02:28.940,00:02:33.236,"Thank you, just trying to be the host with the most ghosts."
00:02:35.738,00:02:40.076,"Oh, Mr. Porter, I can hardly wait to try your delicious Halloween cookies."
00:02:46.040,00:02:50.044,"Mayor Goodway, I think you're smelling your purse."
00:02:55.842,00:02:56.968,"Hi, everybody."
00:03:04.350,00:03:14.027,"Ladies, gentlemen, cat, and chicken, legend has it this pirate vessel once sailed the waters of Adventure Bay with a ghost crew."
00:03:17.739,00:03:19.574,Cali's kind of a scaredy-cat.
00:03:19.657,00:03:22.493,"Well, Chickaletta doesn't believe in ghosts."
00:03:22.577,00:03:24.245,Neither do I. So there.
00:03:27.165,00:03:30.293,Nah. It's fun to play at being scared sometimes.
00:03:30.376,00:03:32.754,But there's no such thing as ghosts.
00:03:38.176,00:03:40.637,"Nothing to worry about. Come on, Cali."
00:03:55.818,00:03:57.862,Who's ready to go trick-or-treating?
00:03:57.946,00:04:00.114,I am. I love trick-or-treating.
00:04:03.952,00:04:06.287,Super Chase is here.
00:04:06.371,00:04:09.123,"Yo, ho, ho and a bowl full of bones."
00:04:09.207,00:04:13.336,"If it isn't me arch enemy, Super Chase. Arr!"
00:04:13.419,00:04:15.964,"You've met your match, Pirate Zuma."
00:04:31.187,00:04:40.446,"All right, pups, we'll go trick-or-treating as soon as I'm-- -Oh! -Wow! Pumpkin ghost! Yikes!"
00:04:47.829,00:04:50.248,"Hey, where did everybody go?"
00:04:55.503,00:05:01.509,"Mr. Porter, Chickaletta thinks that your spider web cookies look yummy enough to catch flies."
00:05:08.808,00:05:11.227,-What was that? -It must be the wind howling.
00:05:11.311,00:05:14.147,Look at the flag up in the crow's nest.
00:05:15.732,00:05:17.692,I'd better get more cookies.
00:05:17.775,00:05:19.193,And leave us alone?
00:05:19.277,00:05:22.447,"I mean, uh, hurry back."
00:05:35.335,00:05:38.546,"Not me, and certainly not Chickaletta."
00:05:40.631,00:05:41.632,Meh.
00:05:43.760,00:05:45.219,That's so strange!
00:05:45.303,00:05:47.180,All the cookies are gone again.
00:06:05.156,00:06:06.407,I have some treats.
00:06:06.491,00:06:07.408,Do you have a trick?
00:06:09.869,00:06:11.204,I have a trick.
00:06:11.746,00:06:14.248,Yip! May I have a treat?
00:06:14.332,00:06:16.334,Very nice.
00:06:17.710,00:06:18.920,Want a shake?
00:06:19.003,00:06:22.090,What a gentleman. Here you go.
00:06:35.728,00:06:37.313,"Thank you, milady."
00:06:38.481,00:06:39.565,I can-- Whoa.
00:06:48.032,00:06:49.617,You deserve a treat!
00:07:43.671,00:07:44.797,Oh no!
00:07:44.881,00:07:47.216,Now the other sail is going up too!
00:07:49.969,00:07:52.597,I didn't realize this party included a cruise!
00:07:54.807,00:07:57.477,I can't wait for Ryder and the pups to get here.
00:07:57.560,00:07:59.645,They're going to love the ghost ship party.
00:08:01.063,00:08:02.064,Whoa!
00:08:05.443,00:08:07.528,This ghost ship is so cool.
00:08:31.469,00:08:36.265,"Cap'n Turbot, where are you?"
00:08:42.897,00:08:44.565,Ah! A sea monster!
00:08:45.233,00:08:46.400,Ah! Where?
00:08:46.484,00:08:48.653,Ah! A talking sea monster!
00:08:48.736,00:08:49.987,Ah! Where?
00:08:50.071,00:08:54.242,Phew! It's no sea monster. It's just Cap'n Turbot.
00:08:56.327,00:08:58.371,Can you sail us back to the dock?
00:08:58.454,00:09:04.752,"Yes, of course, except I seem to have misplaced my glasses in the, uh, ocean."
00:09:04.835,00:09:06.921,I can't see anything without my specs.
00:09:10.466,00:09:14.262,See? I can't see. But it feels like we're going faster.
00:09:15.471,00:09:22.603,Oh dear. We're trapped on a rickety old pirate ship with a captain who can't see and a crew of-- Ghosts?
00:09:22.687,00:09:25.439,Chickaletta and I don't believe in ghosts.
00:09:42.873,00:09:45.126,Hmm. What trick can I do?
00:09:47.628,00:09:49.797,Hind legs? Zuma.
00:09:49.880,00:09:52.800,Speak? We all do that.
00:10:03.769,00:10:04.687,Ryder here.
00:10:04.770,00:10:05.771,"Hi, Ryder."
00:10:05.855,00:10:06.689,"Hi, Mr. Porter."
00:10:06.772,00:10:07.898,How's the party going?
00:10:07.982,00:10:08.858,"Ryder, listen."
00:10:08.941,00:10:10.568,We're adrift in the bay.
00:10:10.651,00:10:14.989,No one knows who's sailing the ship. Cap'n Turbot lost his glasses and can't see to sail the ship.
00:10:26.083,00:10:29.837,We're on it. No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:10:32.256,00:10:34.550,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout."
00:00:51.801,00:00:53.053,Yay!
00:00:57.223,00:00:59.350,"Whoa. Nice move, Chase."
00:00:59.434,00:01:01.519,"Yeah. Awesome shortcut, dude."
00:01:06.191,00:01:10.862,"Mr. Porter, wait until you taste the delicious carrots I grew."
00:01:13.448,00:01:14.699,Strange.
00:01:14.783,00:01:16.910,A row of carrots is missing.
00:01:22.791,00:01:23.833,Gotcha.
00:01:42.519,00:01:44.479,"Hi, Farmer Yumi. What's up?"
00:01:44.562,00:01:46.314,Bunnies. Tonnes of them.
00:01:48.024,00:01:49.943,"Can you and the PAW Patrol help out, Ryder?"
00:01:51.694,00:01:54.823,"No job is too big, no pup is too small."
00:01:54.906,00:01:56.866,No bunny will get past us.
00:02:02.872,00:02:03.706,Whoa!
00:02:07.961,00:02:09.003,Wait for me!
00:02:15.260,00:02:18.388,"Well, at least it's not covering my eyes."
00:02:36.239,00:02:38.366,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:02:45.999,00:02:47.542,Aww. Cute bunny.
00:02:59.637,00:03:05.435,"Sorry, Skye, if there are too many bunnies for Yumi's farm, there are way too many bunnies for here."
00:03:05.518,00:03:06.853,What can we do with them?
00:03:06.936,00:03:10.315,We'll move them to a big field in the hills that they'll love.
00:03:13.902,00:03:19.324,"Rubble, I need you and your shovel to dig a trench around the carrot patch and find the bunnies' tunnels."
00:03:19.407,00:03:21.659,Rubble on the double.
00:03:23.203,00:03:27.207,"Chase, I'll need your megaphone and herding skills to move the bunnies."
00:03:27.290,00:03:29.834,And we may need your net to catch some of them.
00:03:29.918,00:03:31.794,Chase is on the case.
00:03:32.754,00:03:33.755,All right!
00:03:33.838,00:03:35.673,PAW Patrol is on a roll.
00:03:41.429,00:03:42.722,Whoo-hoo!
00:03:42.805,00:03:43.640,Yeah!
00:04:51.374,00:04:54.252,At least we saved some carrots before the rabbits ate them all.
00:05:04.846,00:05:06.764,That's a lot of holes.
00:05:06.848,00:05:08.683,Those bunnies work fast.
00:05:08.766,00:05:13.771,"Rubble, dig a trench around the field so we can see how many tunnels and bunnies there are."
00:05:13.855,00:05:15.023,I'm on it.
00:05:17.233,00:05:18.651,Woof. Shovel.
00:05:27.493,00:05:30.955,"But, Ryder, where will we put them all once Chase rounds them up?"
00:05:32.206,00:05:33.124,I've got it.
00:05:35.710,00:05:39.464,"Rocky, can you get some kennel cages and put the old pup beds in them?"
00:05:39.547,00:05:42.467,"Sure. Don't lose it, reuse it."
00:05:45.094,00:05:48.514,Yeah. I'll be there in two shakes of a bunny's tail.
00:05:48.598,00:05:50.433,"Thanks, pups. Ryder out."
00:05:54.896,00:05:55.938,Huh?
00:06:03.237,00:06:04.530,Huh?
00:06:09.452,00:06:11.579,Wait. Huh? Where did you go?
00:06:11.662,00:06:12.580,Hey! Hey!
00:06:16.000,00:06:18.669,"Chase, see if you can herd them into Bettina's pen."
00:06:18.753,00:06:20.088,"You got it, Ryder."
00:06:22.715,00:06:24.425,You can't outrun Chase.
00:06:28.137,00:06:30.014,But you can out-spin me.
00:06:54.497,00:06:56.457,"Two more coming your way, Chase."
00:07:04.048,00:07:08.428,"We brought cages with nice, soft beds to take you to your new home."
00:07:11.806,00:07:15.810,"And inside each cage are yummy, crunchy treats."
00:07:26.612,00:07:28.322,Aw. They're so adorable.
00:07:31.617,00:07:33.995,This pup's got to fly!
00:07:42.837,00:07:46.591,"For something so cute, they sure do cause a lot of trouble."
00:08:00.146,00:08:04.108,"I can't wait to make a nice, fresh salad with Farmer Yumi's..."
00:08:05.443,00:08:06.319,Oh!
00:08:06.402,00:08:08.112,Naughty bunnies. Don't do that.
00:08:08.196,00:08:10.281,Bunnies! Oh!
00:08:11.866,00:08:13.034,Did we get them all?
00:08:14.285,00:08:16.120,Sounds like Bettina's in trouble.
00:08:16.204,00:08:17.497,Hurry.
00:08:23.419,00:08:25.379,What a scaredy cow.
00:08:29.217,00:08:30.384,"Hi, Mr. Porter."
00:08:30.468,00:08:33.596,"Ryder, now I've got a bunny problem."
00:08:33.679,00:08:35.181,They're everywhere.
00:08:38.226,00:08:39.977,We're on our way.
00:08:46.275,00:08:47.735,Ah! Oh!
00:08:48.653,00:08:49.904,Huh?
00:08:55.743,00:08:56.786,Ha!
00:08:57.370,00:08:59.872,Naughty bunnies. You don't belong there.
00:09:06.546,00:09:09.173,You can stay in there with your-- Huh?
00:09:19.892,00:09:21.435,One scoopful of bunny.
00:09:22.436,00:09:23.688,"Good idea, Rubble."
00:09:27.525,00:09:31.404,Don't worry. We've got the perfect spot for you two.
00:09:33.656,00:09:34.740,What?
00:09:34.824,00:09:36.659,More bunnies? Huh?
00:09:38.327,00:09:40.871,-Oh! -That's too many bunnies to scoop.
00:09:46.502,00:09:48.296,Coming right up.
00:09:48.379,00:09:49.547,Huh?
00:09:50.464,00:09:51.340,Thanks.
00:09:51.424,00:09:52.383,Come and get it.
00:10:00.391,00:10:02.143,"Chase, we need your net."
00:10:09.817,00:10:10.901,"Good work, Chase."
00:10:10.985,00:10:12.320,"-You got them. -Oh, yeah."
00:10:13.738,00:10:16.449,"Whenever there's trouble, just yelp for help."
00:10:16.532,00:10:21.245,Let's get these bunnies someplace where they won't bother you and we won't bother them.
00:10:28.419,00:10:30.630,"Bye-bye, bunnies. I'll miss you."
00:10:32.757,00:10:33.924,And you too.
00:10:35.217,00:10:37.928,I think they're going to be pretty happy out here.
00:11:02.453,00:11:04.121,"She followed me home, Ryder."
00:11:04.205,00:11:06.374,"May I keep her, please?"
00:11:07.750,00:11:09.835,I guess we can handle one bunny.
00:11:09.919,00:11:12.046,"Yay! Ryder, you're the best!"
00:11:12.129,00:11:15.132,"Well, you've all been very good pups."
00:11:27.269,00:11:28.187,Huh?
00:11:28.270,00:11:29.355,Okay.
00:11:31.774,00:11:33.192,Where'd they all come from?
00:11:33.275,00:11:35.611,Who knows? But they sure are fun.
00:00:49.674,00:00:53.803,"Now, when you come out the tube slide, you'll have a nice, soft landing!"
00:00:53.887,00:00:56.431,"Okay, I just need to tighten this bolt."
00:01:04.481,00:01:05.732,Whoo-hoo!
00:01:07.442,00:01:11.988,"Soft as a sandy cloud, and the new slide's all done!"
00:01:22.749,00:01:25.585,"Hey, the pool is opening today!"
00:01:27.253,00:01:30.924,Sounds good! As long as I don't get wet.
00:01:37.972,00:01:40.433,We can't swim in an empty pool!
00:01:40.517,00:01:43.520,Everybody was planning to spend the day at the pool!
00:01:43.603,00:01:48.441,"Alex, Katie… I was planning to spend the day at the pool."
00:01:50.860,00:01:53.613,"I don't know, but we have to find out!"
00:01:53.696,00:01:55.990,This is a job for the PAW Patrol!
00:01:56.074,00:01:57.117,Let's go!
00:02:06.376,00:02:09.379,"Come on, Marshall! It's a pool day!"
00:02:12.215,00:02:20.390,"and sunglasses and sunblock and a hat and some cold water and, of course, my Apollo Superdog comic book."
00:02:21.057,00:02:22.058,Oh!
00:02:25.520,00:02:27.856,I'm ready to float the day away.
00:02:28.982,00:02:31.025,-Excuse us! -Pardon the pups!
00:02:32.694,00:02:34.070,"Go, pups, go!"
00:02:34.154,00:02:35.071,There's Ryder!
00:02:35.864,00:02:36.698,Whoa!
00:02:42.579,00:02:44.998,"Ryder, we've got a big problem!"
00:02:46.708,00:02:48.334,in the pool!
00:02:48.418,00:02:50.503,No water in the swimming pool?
00:02:52.130,00:02:53.173,"Don't worry, Alex."
00:02:53.256,00:02:54.883,The PAW Patrol will fix it.
00:02:54.966,00:02:57.719,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:03:03.766,00:03:05.018,Here I come!
00:03:09.439,00:03:11.316,Whoa!
00:03:11.399,00:03:12.275,Look out!
00:03:16.613,00:03:18.406,The judges can't agree!
00:03:34.881,00:03:37.050,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:03:40.970,00:03:42.263,We have an emergency.
00:03:42.347,00:03:43.890,There's no water in the pool.
00:03:43.973,00:03:47.060,"Yeah, how can we cool off in a dry pool?"
00:03:49.771,00:03:52.023,It gets filled up from the town's water tower.
00:03:52.106,00:03:55.485,"For some reason, the water isn't getting from the tower to the pool."
00:03:55.568,00:03:58.238,We need to find the problem and fix it.
00:03:59.489,00:04:02.492,"Marshall, I need you and your ladder to check out the tower."
00:04:02.575,00:04:04.077,I'm fired up!
00:04:16.422,00:04:18.174,We'll fill it in no time!
00:04:18.258,00:04:21.094,"All right, PAW Patrol is on a roll!"
00:05:27.869,00:05:32.040,There's our problem! The pad holding up the tower slipped.
00:05:32.123,00:05:35.001,That bent the pipe that takes the water to the pool.
00:05:35.084,00:05:37.795,We have to fix the tower before we can fix the pipe.
00:05:40.548,00:05:43.509,No job is too big. No pup is too small!
00:05:47.013,00:05:49.432,"Chase, the pipe from the water tower is bent."
00:05:55.188,00:05:56.105,"Ready, Chase?"
00:05:58.191,00:06:00.360,Is that Skye's bathing cap?
00:06:00.443,00:06:02.653,Huh? No!
00:06:02.737,00:06:03.654,Be right back.
00:06:05.448,00:06:07.241,Chase is on the case!
00:06:10.370,00:06:12.663,Still no water in the pool.
00:06:14.665,00:06:17.627,We have to find some way to help those kids cool down.
00:06:17.710,00:06:18.586,Hmm.
00:06:22.715,00:06:24.550,"Here's your popsicles, Zuma."
00:06:26.094,00:06:27.512,"Thanks, Mr. Porter!"
00:06:37.605,00:06:38.981,"Good thinking, Zuma!"
00:06:43.027,00:06:45.696,"Yay, icy popsicles!"
00:06:46.864,00:06:49.450,"Aw, melted goo!"
00:06:53.955,00:06:55.998,Too bad there's no mustard and ketchup!
00:07:07.552,00:07:08.928,"Okay, PAW Patrol."
00:07:09.011,00:07:10.930,You each have an important job to do.
00:07:13.891,00:07:16.269,"Cable hook and winch, on the way!"
00:07:23.234,00:07:26.446,"Marshall, climb up and attach the hook to the corner of the tower."
00:07:43.212,00:07:44.380,Let's dig it!
00:07:53.431,00:07:54.682,Let's do it!
00:08:13.242,00:08:16.037,Check it out! Here comes Skye to cool us off!
00:08:20.500,00:08:22.627,Uh-oh! Whoa!
00:08:25.922,00:08:29.175,"First I was a hot dog, and now I'm a pup-sicle!"
00:08:33.346,00:08:35.515,"Okay, pups, let's go!"
00:08:37.934,00:08:39.519,"You got it, Ryder!"
00:08:52.073,00:08:54.450,"Okay, Rocky, lift the pad!"
00:09:15.137,00:09:17.473,"Okay, Chase, let it down easy."
00:09:23.854,00:09:25.356,"Great, it's level!"
00:09:25.439,00:09:28.985,"Now, let's fix the bent pipe and get the water flowing to the pool."
00:09:29.068,00:09:30.987,I'll see what I've got in my truck.
00:09:33.072,00:09:34.365,Here's an extra pipe!
00:09:37.076,00:09:40.121,I'm ready to hit the pool and get good and wet!
00:09:40.204,00:09:43.499,I'm ready to sit by the pool and stay good and dry.
00:09:58.973,00:10:00.141,That should do it!
00:10:00.224,00:10:02.101,Let's see if we fixed it!
00:10:03.853,00:10:07.523,"Now, this is a pool day!"
00:10:13.029,00:10:13.863,Huh?
00:10:18.409,00:10:20.911,"Skye, I'm just about to turn the water back on."
00:10:20.995,00:10:23.372,The pool should start filling up any second now.
00:10:23.456,00:10:24.665,Yes!
00:10:24.749,00:10:26.250,"Get ready, everyone!"
00:10:26.334,00:10:28.836,Ryder says the water is on its way!
00:10:51.776,00:10:56.864,"All right, everybody. Ready, set… get wet!"
00:10:57.823,00:11:00.409,Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
00:11:02.495,00:11:03.496,"Hey, Ryder!"
00:11:03.579,00:11:04.664,"Hey, Katie."
00:11:06.874,00:11:09.085,"Thanks for fixing the pool, PAW Patrol!"
00:11:09.168,00:11:10.795,"You're welcome, Alex."
00:11:10.878,00:11:14.215,"Remember, whenever there's trouble, just yelp for help."
00:11:16.175,00:11:19.804,"Okay, pups, time for the cannonball competition!"
00:11:19.887,00:11:21.389,Not me!
00:11:21.472,00:11:23.391,I'm going to stay nice and dry up here.
00:11:23.474,00:11:26.352,"On your bark, get set, go!"
00:11:33.567,00:11:35.653,Zero points for splashing the judge!
00:11:37.822,00:11:39.949,"Oh, Rocky, you're all wet!"
00:01:44.145,00:01:47.315,"Mmm, I'm starving!"
00:01:48.399,00:01:49.359,Who?
00:01:50.693,00:01:52.946,"That's who, whoever you are!"
00:02:08.711,00:02:09.671,You make me laugh.
00:02:13.466,00:02:15.969,"You're an owl, a tiny owl."
00:02:23.434,00:02:26.604,"Hey, that's a good name for you: Little Hootie."
00:02:31.818,00:02:33.695,"Well, you picked the right pup."
00:02:37.198,00:02:38.867,"Hey, wait up!"
00:02:53.965,00:02:55.717,So the problem is this tree?
00:03:08.021,00:03:09.564,More knock-knock jokes?
00:03:19.199,00:03:20.950,"It's stuck, but it seems to be okay."
00:03:22.911,00:03:24.662,Chase is on the case!
00:03:24.746,00:03:28.041,I'll just dig down under the tree and the owl can get out.
00:03:30.126,00:03:31.711,Whoa!
00:03:38.843,00:03:40.261,"Easy, Little Hootie."
00:03:40.345,00:03:42.430,That tree can slip over the cliff!
00:03:43.973,00:03:46.643,Don't worry. I'm going to take care of this.
00:03:46.726,00:03:48.478,We need the PAW Patrol.
00:04:00.949,00:04:03.493,"Who? Oh, I get it."
00:04:19.342,00:04:23.137,"And if we don't do something soon, the whole tree will fall into the sea!"
00:04:23.721,00:04:24.889,"Wow, Chase!"
00:04:26.432,00:04:28.101,"Uh, kinda."
00:04:29.644,00:04:34.482,"Don't worry, Little Hootie. No job is too big. No pup is too small!"
00:04:36.234,00:04:38.152,No owl's too small either.
00:04:41.906,00:04:43.825,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:04:47.287,00:04:48.788,"Whoa, look out!"
00:04:50.456,00:04:53.751,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
00:05:05.513,00:05:07.890,"Whoa, wait for me!"
00:05:13.104,00:05:14.314,Little Hootie.
00:05:29.996,00:05:31.748,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:05:33.624,00:05:36.044,"This little owl has an emergency, pups."
00:05:37.170,00:05:42.884,"A heavy wind knocked over the tree where Little Hootie lives, and another owl is trapped in the knothole."
00:05:42.967,00:05:44.469,That's terrible!
00:05:44.552,00:05:45.553,We have to help.
00:05:45.636,00:05:48.056,The tree is hanging off a cliff over the water.
00:05:48.139,00:05:49.932,It can tip over any minute.
00:05:51.517,00:05:56.397,"Chase, I'll need you to use your winch to hold the tree so it doesn't move any further."
00:05:56.481,00:05:58.566,Chase is on the case!
00:05:58.649,00:06:01.277,"Plus, we might need someone who can speak owl."
00:06:01.361,00:06:03.404,Chase speaks owl?
00:06:03.488,00:06:07.575,I don't really speak it. I just know what he's trying to say.
00:06:16.667,00:06:19.587,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:07:33.536,00:07:36.205,I saw the big owl in the knothole right here.
00:07:37.623,00:07:39.459,"Hoo, hoo?"
00:07:44.922,00:07:47.842,"Okay, let's get this owl out of the tree."
00:07:47.925,00:07:49.177,"See, Little Hootie?"
00:07:51.929,00:07:52.889,Little Hootie?
00:07:59.437,00:08:04.692,"Owls are nocturnal, which means they stay awake all night, so it's no wonder he's tired."
00:08:04.775,00:08:05.735,Uh-oh!
00:08:09.572,00:08:12.241,"-Good job, Chase! -Nice catch!"
00:08:30.927,00:08:32.261,Hook secured.
00:08:41.395,00:08:43.940,Try to dig some dirt out from under the tree.
00:09:01.624,00:09:03.584,"Hang on, we're going to get you!"
00:09:11.759,00:09:12.969,Ah-ha!
00:09:17.306,00:09:20.685,"We're good! But we need to get that owl out, and fast!"
00:09:23.854,00:09:24.981,Hang on!
00:09:42.707,00:09:44.083,That should do it!
00:09:49.589,00:09:50.631,Whoa!
00:09:54.176,00:09:56.679,"Whoa, that was close, Little Hootie!"
00:10:02.310,00:10:05.813,"You know, I think that's not just any owl."
00:10:05.896,00:10:08.065,I think it's Little Hootie's mama.
00:10:08.149,00:10:11.068,"Aw, I think you're right, Ryder."
00:10:11.152,00:10:14.530,"Chase, you saved Little Hootie and his mom."
00:10:16.282,00:10:17.867,"Hello, Mama Hootie."
00:10:23.914,00:10:25.499,"Aw, you're welcome."
00:10:32.590,00:10:34.175,"Great job, guys!"
00:10:34.258,00:10:35.217,All set to go?
00:10:40.556,00:10:41.932,Where are you going to live now?
00:10:45.853,00:10:47.146,Ah-ha!
00:10:49.106,00:10:51.734,This looks like a sturdy tree. Why don't you try it?
00:11:02.495,00:11:05.706,"Well, at least you know where they are, Chase."
00:11:05.790,00:11:07.917,You can always check in on Little Hootie.
00:11:08.000,00:11:10.461,"Yeah, I guess I can!"
00:11:22.014,00:11:24.100,What's owl for sleep tight?
00:11:27.770,00:11:28.688,Hoo-hoo!
00:11:30.272,00:11:32.983,"Hoo-hoo, Little Hootie, hoo-hoo."
00:00:51.801,00:00:54.721,Snow? Snow doesn't start with an F.
00:01:05.023,00:01:08.318,"Hey, PAW Patrol. Who feels like taking a snow day?"
00:01:12.697,00:01:16.826,"Uh, can someone untangle me? Please?"
00:01:28.254,00:01:31.341,I'm going to board this powder like a pro.
00:01:34.552,00:01:37.097,Carry your board-- I already know what to do.
00:01:37.180,00:01:39.682,Stand on the board and go.
00:01:41.726,00:01:42.811,Whoa!
00:01:43.394,00:01:44.729,Wrong way!
00:01:44.813,00:01:48.608,"No, dude! I said carry your board! That slope's too steep!"
00:01:51.069,00:01:53.363,Whoa!
00:01:54.114,00:01:56.407,Look out for the rescue sled!
00:01:56.491,00:01:57.784,Whoa!
00:01:59.452,00:02:02.288,"Oh! Sit down, little dude!"
00:02:14.425,00:02:16.136,Awesome!
00:02:33.278,00:02:34.445,Whoa!
00:02:35.446,00:02:37.073,Almost got you!
00:02:38.241,00:02:39.659,Nice grab!
00:02:44.455,00:02:46.249,Whoo!
00:02:49.711,00:02:51.212,Hold on.
00:02:53.590,00:02:54.424,Whoa!
00:03:12.108,00:03:14.903,"That was so cool, Jake!"
00:03:14.986,00:03:18.615,"Uh, sorry, little dude, but that was so not cool."
00:03:56.110,00:03:57.362,Whoa!
00:04:00.031,00:04:03.034,…and some help from the PAW Patrol.
00:04:17.632,00:04:20.176,If I could just make this snowboard go.
00:04:22.512,00:04:23.638,I'm stuck.
00:04:25.932,00:04:27.475,"Come on, Marshall!"
00:04:33.314,00:04:34.565,Here I come!
00:04:36.693,00:04:39.737,"Uh, thanks for getting me unstuck."
00:04:56.796,00:04:58.798,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:04:58.881,00:05:02.260,"Okay, PAW Patrol, there's a problem up on Jake's mountain."
00:05:03.636,00:05:07.181,"Jake and Alex are stuck at the bottom of a steep, icy slope."
00:05:07.265,00:05:10.685,Whoa! Jake usually rescues snowboarders.
00:05:10.768,00:05:15.064,"That's right, but now it's up to the PAW Patrol to do the rescuing."
00:05:15.148,00:05:20.320,"Chase, I need you and your winch motor to help in case we need to pull them up the slope."
00:05:20.403,00:05:22.530,Chase is on the case!
00:05:33.666,00:05:36.252,"Once this rescue's over, we'll have our snow day."
00:06:49.117,00:06:51.953,"Sorry, Jake. I really messed up."
00:07:03.673,00:07:05.341,"Ryder, I can see Jake."
00:07:07.885,00:07:09.971,Totally getting rescued!
00:07:17.270,00:07:19.355,"Man, that was close!"
00:07:20.398,00:07:23.067,"It's no good, Ryder. I can't get close to them!"
00:07:23.151,00:07:25.903,The wind from the 'copter could cause an avalanche.
00:07:25.987,00:07:26.904,"All right, Skye."
00:07:26.988,00:07:30.491,Come in and we'll figure out a way to get Alex and Jake off that ledge.
00:07:30.575,00:07:31.951,"Over and out, Ryder."
00:07:39.375,00:07:41.711,"Jake, Skye can't get the 'copter close to you."
00:07:44.046,00:07:48.050,"Sure, Ryder. Get Alex up safe and I can make it down easy."
00:07:48.134,00:07:49.719,"All right, here I come."
00:07:49.802,00:08:01.230,"Watch out for falling rocks… Chase, I'll hook Skye's rope and harness to your winch to give some extra length. Lower me down, then pull Alex and me back up."
00:08:01.314,00:08:03.107,Chase is on the case!
00:08:04.233,00:08:06.986,"Skye, you can help me find the best way down."
00:08:07.069,00:08:09.113,Let's take to the sky!
00:08:16.245,00:08:18.664,"Okay, Chase! Lower me down!"
00:08:18.748,00:08:19.874,You bet!
00:08:31.260,00:08:32.220,Looking good!
00:08:35.431,00:08:37.350,You're too close to that icy patch.
00:08:37.433,00:08:38.809,Whoa!
00:08:41.187,00:08:43.356,-Heads up! -Whoa!
00:08:44.607,00:08:45.608,Look!
00:08:46.317,00:08:48.027,"Nice of you to drop in, dude."
00:08:48.110,00:08:51.405,"Hey, Jake. All right, Alex, ready to get off this ledge?"
00:08:51.489,00:08:52.532,I'm ready.
00:08:58.621,00:09:03.000,Been looking for an excuse to board this slope all year.
00:09:03.084,00:09:06.462,"Remember, do exactly what I tell you so we can get up safely."
00:09:19.559,00:09:22.228,Wow! This is cool!
00:09:25.690,00:09:27.650,-Oops! -I got you!
00:09:28.985,00:09:30.027,Huh?
00:09:35.491,00:09:36.701,Are you okay?
00:09:36.784,00:09:38.661,Yeah. But why did we stop?
00:09:39.745,00:09:41.539,"Chase, why did you stop the winch motor?"
00:09:41.622,00:09:43.916,I didn't! Something's stuck!
00:09:49.797,00:09:51.090,Uh-oh.
00:10:09.233,00:10:10.693,"Great idea, Chase!"
00:10:12.403,00:10:15.781,"Now, make it fast. My paws are freezing!"
00:10:15.865,00:10:17.950,"Okay, Alex, up you go."
00:10:24.707,00:10:25.750,Made it!
00:10:26.250,00:10:27.793,"Thanks, Chase."
00:10:27.877,00:10:29.962,"You're welcome. Coming, Ryder?"
00:10:30.046,00:10:32.506,"All right, Chase. You saved the day."
00:10:33.841,00:10:35.801,"Hey, Ryder, all cool up there?"
00:10:35.885,00:10:36.802,We made it.
00:10:41.140,00:10:43.392,Yee-haw!
00:10:51.150,00:10:55.029,"Thanks for helping me out of there, Ryder, and you too, Chase."
00:10:55.112,00:10:56.364,"You're welcome, Alex."
00:10:56.447,00:10:59.158,"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help."
00:11:02.370,00:11:07.249,"If I promise to listen to everything you say this time, can I try boarding again?"
00:11:10.586,00:11:13.756,"As soon as the rest of the pups get here, we'll hit the slope."
00:00:49.799,00:00:54.554,"The doctors helped her get healthy again, and now she's going back home to the jungle on a train."
00:00:54.637,00:00:56.806,She has a special car and everything.
00:01:00.852,00:01:02.395,-Come on! -Great!
00:01:06.608,00:01:09.277,"Next stop, Adventure Bay!"
00:01:31.299,00:01:34.135,All your fruits and vegetables are on this car.
00:01:37.430,00:01:38.681,Wonderful!
00:01:41.601,00:01:44.020,Smell those oranges and mangoes!
00:02:05.917,00:02:06.876,Mmm!
00:02:15.510,00:02:17.554,"Thank you, Marshall."
00:02:19.597,00:02:21.599,Whoa!
00:02:46.791,00:02:47.709,Where'd she go?
00:02:55.758,00:02:57.385,"Hey, my van!"
00:03:01.973,00:03:04.559,Come back with my van!
00:03:07.312,00:03:09.647,Mandy can't run wild in Adventure Bay.
00:03:09.731,00:03:11.774,Don't worry. We'll get her back.
00:03:50.521,00:03:52.315,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:03:54.609,00:03:57.278,A monkey named Mandy escaped from the train.
00:03:57.362,00:03:59.822,A monkey's running around Adventure Bay?
00:03:59.906,00:04:00.949,Awesome!
00:04:03.201,00:04:06.871,"She drove off in Mr. Porter's van, taking all his bananas with her."
00:04:09.999,00:04:11.960,"Yeah, I thought only pups could."
00:04:16.756,00:04:18.716,She's not going to be easy to catch.
00:04:19.801,00:04:24.514,"Skye, I need your helicopter to search for Mandy and Mr. Porter's van from the air."
00:04:26.891,00:04:29.310,This pup's gotta fly!
00:04:30.895,00:04:34.983,"Chase, I need your net to catch Mandy and put her back on the train."
00:04:35.066,00:04:37.485,Chase is on the case!
00:04:37.568,00:04:40.530,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:05:36.210,00:05:38.254,See if you can spot Mandy or the van.
00:05:38.338,00:05:40.048,"You got it, Ryder."
00:05:46.220,00:05:48.473,She's just about to reach City Hall.
00:06:17.835,00:06:19.212,Whoa!
00:06:40.525,00:06:42.902,That train is headed right towards Mandy!
00:06:42.985,00:06:45.113,"Don't worry, Ryder. I'll stop her."
00:06:53.371,00:06:54.622,"Attention, monkey!"
00:07:30.533,00:07:32.743,"Wait, Mandy! Come back!"
00:07:52.930,00:07:54.515,Cool!
00:08:00.271,00:08:03.232,"As soon a Mandy comes for the banana, catch her in your net."
00:08:04.901,00:08:08.279,"Oh, Mandy, come and get a nice banana!"
00:08:09.739,00:08:11.199,"Get ready, Chase."
00:08:20.041,00:08:21.626,"Oops, that didn't work!"
00:08:22.210,00:08:23.461,"Sorry, Ryder!"
00:08:46.484,00:08:48.402,Let's see if we can catch her.
00:09:00.581,00:09:02.625,"Pups, Mandy is headed your way."
00:09:16.889,00:09:19.433,"Wow, Mandy sure loves to climb!"
00:09:25.773,00:09:29.151,Mandy loves to climb and swing and slide!
00:09:48.671,00:09:50.798,Here we go! Let's hope it works.
00:10:04.937,00:10:06.647,Look what I've got.
00:10:13.904,00:10:15.072,Oh!
00:10:28.461,00:10:29.670,Great job!
00:10:31.088,00:10:34.342,"Um, Mr. Porter, you better get behind the wheel before Mandy does."
00:10:34.425,00:10:35.843,"Oh, right!"
00:10:48.064,00:10:50.066,"Bye, Mandy! Get home safe!"
00:10:52.109,00:10:54.737,"Thanks for getting my van back, PAW Patrol."
00:10:54.820,00:10:55.780,You're welcome.
00:11:00.326,00:11:02.745,The van is all loaded up with mangoes and oranges.
00:11:02.828,00:11:04.705,But Mandy ate most of the bananas.
00:11:11.796,00:11:13.464,Any monkeys around here want one?
00:11:14.048,00:11:15.675,-Huh? -Huh?
00:11:24.517,00:11:25.434,"Ooh-ooh, ee-ee!"
00:11:35.069,00:11:36.987,"Monkey see, monkey do!"
00:00:51.843,00:00:54.179,Rubble on the double!
00:00:55.013,00:00:56.473,Whee!
00:00:59.976,00:01:01.352,"Thanks, Katie."
00:01:07.650,00:01:10.653,"Okay, Rocky! Your bath's almost ready!"
00:01:24.459,00:01:26.836,"Hey, hey, hey! It's bath day!"
00:01:26.920,00:01:29.923,I love a good warm bath.
00:01:30.799,00:01:31.674,"Hi, Rubble!"
00:01:39.974,00:01:41.518,"Thanks, Katie!"
00:01:42.102,00:01:44.437,"Ah, perfect!"
00:01:44.938,00:01:47.065,"Okay, now Rocky's bath."
00:01:47.148,00:01:48.733,Has anybody seen him?
00:01:57.867,00:01:59.619,There you are! Come on.
00:02:15.385,00:02:19.597,"Hi, Katie. Is my bath ready? Huh."
00:02:30.150,00:02:31.860,"Oh, hi, Ryder."
00:02:37.240,00:02:39.617,"…I guess you'd say, uh, stuck."
00:02:40.118,00:02:41.828,The Flounder ran aground?
00:02:41.911,00:02:43.538,"Afraid so, Ryder."
00:02:43.621,00:02:46.374,I'm caught on some rocks and the tide's going out.
00:02:46.457,00:02:50.253,"If I can't get free, the Flounder will end up in the bottom of the bay!"
00:02:50.336,00:02:53.214,Is it possibly within your PAW Patrol power to help?
00:02:53.298,00:02:54.924,"Don't worry, Cap'n Turbot."
00:03:02.682,00:03:04.726,PAW Patrol to the Lookout!
00:03:04.809,00:03:06.311,Ryder's calling!
00:03:06.394,00:03:09.397,"Aw, I guess I'll have my bath later."
00:03:10.023,00:03:13.109,"When there's trouble, Rubble's there on the double!"
00:03:16.905,00:03:17.739,Gotta go!
00:03:27.790,00:03:29.292,Whoa! Look out!
00:03:52.732,00:03:54.859,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:03:59.906,00:04:02.033,Cap'n Turbot's boat has run aground.
00:04:02.116,00:04:04.953,"Help, help! Help, help, help!"
00:04:15.672,00:04:19.717,We need a plan to get his boat off the rocks before the tide goes out.
00:04:24.847,00:04:28.351,I'll need you and your hovercraft to help me pull the boat off the rocks.
00:04:43.283,00:04:45.410,PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:04:58.298,00:04:59.799,Yeah!
00:06:04.489,00:06:07.784,"Ryder! Zuma! Oh, thanks for coming to the rescue!"
00:06:09.619,00:06:16.667,"Well, I got so excited watching a wily old walrus waddle in the waves that I forgot to watch out for the rocks."
00:06:18.211,00:06:19.629,"Leave it to us, Cap'n!"
00:06:19.712,00:06:21.631,Zuma and I can get you free.
00:06:21.714,00:06:23.299,Just attach these lines.
00:06:27.053,00:06:28.137,All set!
00:06:28.221,00:06:29.472,"Okay, Cap'n!"
00:06:29.555,00:06:32.225,"Skye, how's it look from up there?"
00:06:36.854,00:06:41.192,Just avoid that big rock straight ahead and you'll get the Flounder out no problem.
00:06:53.496,00:06:55.331,The boat's still hung up!
00:06:56.040,00:06:58.668,Is there anything heavy you don't need on board?
00:07:01.337,00:07:03.089,"Hmm, no."
00:07:03.840,00:07:05.466,"Oh, wait! I know!"
00:07:18.479,00:07:21.149,Turns out he sleeps and eats an awful lot.
00:07:23.067,00:07:24.610,I couldn't agree more!
00:07:27.655,00:07:29.824,"Bye, Wally! Feed ya later!"
00:07:53.222,00:07:56.392,"Whoa, Cap'n Turbot! You're sinking!"
00:07:56.476,00:07:58.102,You appear to be correct.
00:07:58.186,00:08:00.438,The boat is getting lower in the water.
00:08:01.022,00:08:04.609,Help. Help. Help! Help! Help! Help!
00:08:08.279,00:08:10.865,"Calm down, Turbot. Calm down. It's all right."
00:08:14.869,00:08:17.413,The rocks must have ripped a hole in the hull!
00:08:21.334,00:08:23.211,We have to do something.
00:08:24.045,00:08:25.171,That's it!
00:08:28.257,00:08:29.926,"We need him out here, fast!"
00:08:38.392,00:08:41.437,Something to patch a big hole in Cap'n Turbot's boat.
00:08:49.278,00:08:50.446,Not that either.
00:08:52.281,00:08:53.741,"Nope, not strong enough."
00:08:56.285,00:08:58.162,"Don't lose it, reuse it!"
00:09:05.586,00:09:07.922,She'll fly you out here in no time.
00:09:09.090,00:09:11.634,This pup's gotta fly!
00:09:22.687,00:09:24.397,Let me out of this thing!
00:09:24.480,00:09:26.274,Whoa! Oof!
00:09:26.357,00:09:27.191,Whoa!
00:09:29.443,00:09:32.196,Why is everything trying to get me wet today?
00:09:34.365,00:09:36.367,This patch should be perfect.
00:09:36.450,00:09:38.578,"Let's get it attached to the boat, Zuma."
00:09:38.661,00:09:40.162,Let's dive in!
00:09:40.246,00:09:43.207,Abandon ship!
00:09:47.628,00:09:49.005,And your ship.
00:10:20.119,00:10:22.038,"We sure did, Zuma!"
00:10:23.122,00:10:24.749,"Go ahead, Ryder!"
00:10:24.832,00:10:26.375,You got it!
00:10:32.089,00:10:34.216,You saved the Flounder!
00:10:38.429,00:10:40.222,"Thanks, Ryder and Zuma."
00:10:44.518,00:10:47.480,How 'bout the belly? How 'bout the belly?
00:10:55.404,00:10:57.073,Tickle spot! Tickle spot!
00:10:58.616,00:11:00.201,"Good job, PAW Patrol."
00:11:25.017,00:11:25.851,Figures.
00:11:28.312,00:11:30.064,"There you go, Rocky."
00:11:31.774,00:11:33.234,Why me?
00:01:01.936,00:01:04.064,That ladder's paw-toasting hot.
00:01:04.147,00:01:07.525,"Aw, too hot for a sliding championship today."
00:01:16.910,00:01:17.994,Me first.
00:01:30.465,00:01:31.716,Whee!
00:01:32.425,00:01:33.676,Whoo-hoo!
00:01:35.261,00:01:37.180,"My turn, my turn, my turn."
00:01:39.474,00:01:41.893,Whoa! No! Whoa!
00:01:41.976,00:01:43.103,Look out above!
00:01:46.648,00:01:47.649,Sorry.
00:02:08.628,00:02:10.046,"Marshall, give it a blast."
00:02:14.467,00:02:16.219,Whee!
00:02:17.971,00:02:19.222,Super slippy.
00:02:21.057,00:02:23.101,Whee!
00:02:24.102,00:02:25.937,Whoa!
00:02:27.355,00:02:28.523,Rubble!
00:02:29.899,00:02:31.067,Are you all right?
00:02:32.360,00:02:33.403,Again!
00:02:39.784,00:02:41.244,Oh! Oh!
00:02:50.795,00:02:54.966,"I have a whale of a… Uh, well, a whale of a whale problem."
00:03:07.729,00:03:12.400,Yup. She's at risk of serious epidermal dehydration complications.
00:03:14.569,00:03:16.821,Otherwise known as getting all dried out.
00:03:16.905,00:03:18.698,"Can you lend a hand, Ryder?"
00:03:18.781,00:03:20.658,A hand and some paws.
00:03:20.742,00:03:23.620,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:03:24.662,00:03:26.623,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout."
00:03:26.706,00:03:29.626,Whee!
00:03:39.844,00:03:42.055,Whoa!
00:03:48.186,00:04:00.073,Where's… Made it. Phew.
00:04:15.630,00:04:17.715,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:04:21.010,00:04:23.846,We have a poor little whale in big trouble.
00:04:25.598,00:04:28.685,We need to get her back in deep water and fast.
00:04:28.768,00:04:30.436,She must miss her mom.
00:04:30.520,00:04:32.355,Don't worry. I've got a plan.
00:04:34.357,00:04:35.191,Rubble.
00:04:36.985,00:04:41.197,I need you to dig a channel so the water can reach the baby whale.
00:04:41.281,00:04:44.033,"When high tide comes in, the whale can float out."
00:04:44.117,00:04:45.743,Rubble on the double.
00:04:49.831,00:04:54.127,I need you to use your fire hose to keep the whale wet till the tide comes in.
00:04:54.210,00:04:58.006,"Yes! I'm going to get that whale wet, wet, wet."
00:05:13.938,00:05:16.024,Whoa!
00:06:06.991,00:06:08.785,PAW Patrol here to help.
00:06:08.868,00:06:12.205,"Thanks, Ryder. I just can't keep this poor little whale wet enough."
00:06:40.066,00:06:42.985,"Make sure the channel is nice and wide, Rubble."
00:06:43.069,00:06:45.363,We'll need lots of water to float her out.
00:06:45.446,00:06:46.739,Let's dig it.
00:06:57.083,00:06:58.709,"Just about done here, Ryder."
00:07:01.337,00:07:04.048,There should be enough water to carry the baby whale out.
00:07:12.723,00:07:14.142,Hope it works.
00:07:16.102,00:07:17.728,"Higher, higher, higher!"
00:07:22.316,00:07:25.528,I'm afraid the tide won't get any higher than that.
00:07:25.611,00:07:30.032,Maybe we can get the little whale in the water with a big push.
00:07:45.214,00:07:46.799,Excuse you.
00:07:57.518,00:07:58.478,Hey.
00:08:06.360,00:08:07.737,I bet it's her mom.
00:08:14.368,00:08:17.997,"If she comes too close, that mama whale may get stuck too."
00:08:18.080,00:08:21.125,Two beached whales is two too many.
00:08:21.209,00:08:24.212,"Cap'n Turbot, aren't whales sensitive to sound?"
00:08:24.295,00:08:29.759,"Oh, yes. A calamitous cacophony-- I mean, loud noises scare them."
00:08:29.842,00:08:33.387,Then we need to make enough noise to keep her away from here.
00:08:46.943,00:08:48.444,She's slowing down.
00:08:48.528,00:08:51.364,Good. But we need her to turn around.
00:09:12.009,00:09:13.844,Who knows how long she'll stay out there.
00:09:15.096,00:09:19.016,We need to get the little whale back in the water. Fast.
00:09:23.145,00:09:29.527,Hmm. I know. Maybe Rocky could rig something up that could help us slide the baby whale out into the bay.
00:09:35.408,00:09:37.702,"Thanks for getting here so fast, Rocky."
00:09:37.785,00:09:39.870,Rocky to the rescue.
00:09:41.581,00:09:44.542,"Okay, Rocky, roll it into the channel."
00:09:49.755,00:09:53.801,"Perfect. Marshall, can you spray the plastic so it's slippery?"
00:09:53.884,00:09:55.136,Sure can.
00:10:03.853,00:10:17.783,"One, two, three, No! I'm all wet."
00:10:30.004,00:10:31.213,"What's wrong, Rubble?"
00:10:31.297,00:10:34.050,"Just, um, sand in my eye."
00:10:44.393,00:10:47.355,"Well, I realize I'm not technically a pup."
00:10:54.278,00:10:55.655,Super tasty.
00:10:58.741,00:11:01.410,Mmm. Try some?
00:11:04.664,00:11:06.040,"Here you go, pups."
00:01:00.602,00:01:02.604,"Ready for a basket, Rocky?"
00:01:03.104,00:01:04.022,Ready!
00:01:09.944,00:01:11.571,Nothing but bin.
00:01:35.386,00:01:37.305,The beach really needs it.
00:01:37.388,00:01:40.809,The wind from the storm blew over almost all the recycle bins.
00:01:41.309,00:01:46.147,I wonder who's going to win the prize for best beach picker-upper.
00:01:52.320,00:01:53.154,Whoa!
00:02:13.842,00:02:17.011,You guys went right past these without picking them up.
00:02:17.095,00:02:20.014,You'll never win the bone like that.
00:02:31.276,00:02:34.904,"Hey, Wally! Sorry, buddy. No treats right now."
00:02:49.919,00:02:53.047,"Okay, if you're going to help, I guess I owe you."
00:03:07.645,00:03:10.273,Wow! Great trick! Do another.
00:03:20.658,00:03:21.576,What else you got?
00:03:29.959,00:03:32.003,"Huh, that's a pretty long time, Wally."
00:03:36.841,00:03:37.759,Wally?
00:03:37.842,00:03:40.803,"I think that's long enough, Wally. Where are you, buddy?"
00:03:49.979,00:03:52.523,Hang on! I'll get help!
00:04:02.951,00:04:04.577,"Hi, Cap'n. What's up?"
00:04:04.661,00:04:06.788,"It's Wally. Well, he's not up."
00:04:06.871,00:04:10.792,"He's down, down deep underwater, and well, he's not coming up!"
00:04:10.875,00:04:14.003,I don't understand. Wally's underwater?
00:04:14.087,00:04:15.797,Yes. I think he's stuck.
00:04:15.880,00:04:19.300,"Walruses can hold their breath a long time, but not forever."
00:04:19.384,00:04:21.970,"-Can you help make sure Wally's okay? -Don't worry, Cap'n."
00:04:22.053,00:04:24.055,The PAW Patrol is on the way.
00:04:53.710,00:04:55.295,-Whoa! -Look out!
00:04:57.255,00:04:59.340,"Hey, it's not so crowded up here."
00:05:14.605,00:05:16.774,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir."
00:05:18.735,00:05:20.862,we really got to move this time.
00:05:25.992,00:05:29.329,"Walruses can hold their breath a long time, but not forever."
00:05:31.664,00:05:35.835,"Zuma, I need you and your scuba gear to dive under with me to find Wally."
00:05:35.918,00:05:37.420,Let's dive in!
00:05:39.005,00:05:43.009,"Chase, I need you and your winch, in case we need help bringing him ashore."
00:05:43.092,00:05:45.178,Chase is on the case!
00:05:45.928,00:05:48.431,"Everyone else, help finish the clean up."
00:05:50.016,00:05:52.977,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:06:41.859,00:06:43.778,"Chase, head for the beach!"
00:06:43.861,00:07:09.345,"You got it, Ryder, I'm on shore across from Turbot's boat, Ryder."
00:07:10.721,00:07:13.433,Stand by until we figure out what's wrong with Wally.
00:07:13.516,00:07:16.436,"Ryder, Zuma, thanks for getting here so fast."
00:07:20.398,00:07:21.441,"Ready, Zuma?"
00:07:21.524,00:07:23.317,"Ready, set, get wet."
00:08:06.110,00:08:09.197,"Zuma, the net leads down there."
00:08:31.302,00:08:32.178,Ryder!
00:08:47.860,00:08:51.614,"Come on, Wally, buddy. You can do it. I know you can do it."
00:08:54.116,00:08:55.535,Wally?
00:09:05.711,00:09:08.172,Wally's too twisted up in that old fishing net.
00:09:08.256,00:09:10.591,I can't get the big dude loose.
00:09:10.675,00:09:14.470,Hmm… Let's use Chase's winch to pull Wally to shore.
00:09:14.554,00:09:16.639,We can untangle him there.
00:09:16.722,00:09:18.891,Great plan. I'm on it.
00:09:23.354,00:09:26.315,Chase! Ryder needs your winch!
00:09:35.366,00:09:36.951,Go long!
00:09:50.423,00:09:52.133,Bring him in slow!
00:10:22.705,00:10:25.249,"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help."
00:10:39.972,00:10:42.767,"Well, I did have a little help."
00:10:45.936,00:10:49.148,"That's the recycling we all collected together, Ryder."
00:10:49.231,00:10:55.613,"That's right. Like I promised, the hardest working pup deserves a bone."
00:00:56.973,00:00:59.225,Apollo the Super Pup?
00:01:00.894,00:01:02.062,Ta-da!
00:01:05.815,00:01:08.276,Apollo the Super Pup!
00:01:09.694,00:01:12.072,I love Apollo the Super Pup!
00:01:13.114,00:01:15.158,"-You comfy, Rubble? -Yeah."
00:01:15.241,00:01:16.785,"Thanks, Rocky."
00:01:45.522,00:01:46.773,No problem.
00:01:49.526,00:01:51.820,his own super way!
00:01:51.903,00:01:57.534,Tune in next week for another exciting episode of… Apollo the Super Pup!
00:02:00.745,00:02:04.415,Isn't Apollo the superest super pup ever?
00:02:09.003,00:02:10.755,-Sure. -Let's go!
00:02:11.965,00:02:12.882,Huh?
00:02:12.966,00:02:14.008,"Coming, Rubble?"
00:02:16.594,00:02:18.513,"Uh, no thanks, Ryder."
00:02:25.812,00:02:28.857,Hmm… Who can I save?
00:02:32.110,00:02:33.570,"Great idea, Ryder."
00:02:49.544,00:02:50.795,"Hi, Farmer Yumi."
00:02:50.879,00:02:53.423,Need a super pup to save the day?
00:02:53.506,00:02:55.884,My chickens flew the coop when I left the door open.
00:02:57.468,00:02:58.469,Don't worry!
00:03:34.047,00:03:37.842,"I can give you a ride, just like Apollo the Super Pup."
00:03:37.926,00:03:39.677,"Here they come, Farmer Yumi!"
00:03:42.138,00:03:45.725,Rubble the Super Pup saves the day!
00:03:48.478,00:03:49.938,Ah.
00:04:01.157,00:04:04.327,Rubble the Super Pup is on his way!
00:04:08.206,00:04:12.126,Rubble the Super Pup is here to save the day!
00:04:12.627,00:04:14.295,"-Hi, Mayor Goodway. -Huh?"
00:04:14.379,00:04:16.589,"Rubble, just the pup I need."
00:04:16.673,00:04:19.384,The train engineer called to say there's been a rockslide.
00:04:27.016,00:04:30.979,"Don't worry, Mayor Goodway. Rubble is here to save the day!"
00:04:31.062,00:04:32.063,"Thanks, Rubble!"
00:04:32.146,00:04:33.898,I'll get Ryder and the pups.
00:04:36.025,00:04:39.320,Wait. I don't have to stop Ryder's soccer game.
00:04:40.113,00:04:44.450,Rubble the Super Pup can save the day his own way.
00:04:54.752,00:04:58.339,Rubble the Super Pup is here to save the day!
00:04:58.423,00:05:01.259,"There you are, Rubble. I knew the PAW Patrol would save the day."
00:05:01.342,00:05:02.343,Mm-hmm.
00:05:03.219,00:05:06.347,But where's your rig and Ryder and the other pups?
00:05:08.766,00:05:15.231,"Rubble the Super Pup can handle this, just like Apollo the Super Pup does… on my own."
00:05:15.315,00:05:16.733,All by yourself?
00:05:16.816,00:05:19.861,Looks like more rocks could come down if we're not careful.
00:05:25.867,00:05:32.248,I… just… need to move… this… boulder!
00:05:34.417,00:05:36.085,-Look out! -Rockslide!
00:05:42.050,00:05:44.677,"I'm fine, but the tunnel is blocked."
00:05:52.268,00:05:54.395,"Too late, the other entrance is blocked too."
00:05:58.816,00:06:03.196,I thought I could do it myself. I didn't save the day.
00:06:06.449,00:06:08.826,"That's okay, Rubble. You were just trying to help."
00:06:11.037,00:06:12.747,Call Ryder and the PAW Patrol!
00:06:31.474,00:06:33.476,Why are you in the dark?
00:06:33.559,00:06:35.061,There was a rockslide.
00:06:35.144,00:06:37.688,I'm trapped in the mountain tunnel with the engineer.
00:06:41.025,00:06:44.070,No job is too big. No pup is too small.
00:06:46.531,00:06:48.658,"PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!"
00:07:03.131,00:07:05.591,Five. One of us is missing.
00:07:24.485,00:07:26.779,"Ready for action, Ryder, sir!"
00:07:32.368,00:07:35.997,"I know, pups. This time we have to save Rubble."
00:07:36.080,00:07:37.623,-Rubble? -Huh?
00:07:45.047,00:07:47.633,That's too big a problem to take care of alone.
00:07:47.717,00:07:49.886,Now he and the engineer are trapped.
00:07:55.057,00:07:57.101,Chase is on the case.
00:08:02.857,00:08:06.277,We need his truck to move the rest of the rocks once we get him out.
00:08:06.360,00:08:09.864,"Zuma, uh… on the double."
00:08:09.947,00:08:12.909,All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!
00:09:03.876,00:09:05.962,How do you work this thing?
00:09:08.005,00:09:09.131,I got it!
00:09:29.735,00:09:31.821,"Hey, was that my rig?"
00:09:37.868,00:09:40.913,"Chase, see if you can make Rubble an exit."
00:09:55.177,00:09:56.804,"Great job, Chase."
00:09:56.887,00:09:59.307,"Rubble, can you squeeze through?"
