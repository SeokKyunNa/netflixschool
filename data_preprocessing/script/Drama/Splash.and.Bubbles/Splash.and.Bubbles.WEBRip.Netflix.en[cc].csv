00:01:01.041,00:01:05.458,"Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy."
00:01:05.500,00:01:08.625,"- Good morning, Bubbles!"
00:01:08.666,00:01:10.583,Ready for a Reeftown Rangers adventure today?
00:01:10.625,00:01:12.791,"Splash, I was still sleeping."
00:01:12.833,00:01:18.541,I always forget you mandarin dragonets need a lot more sleep - than us yellowback fusiliers.
00:01:18.583,00:01:21.583,"How about you just come back a little later, huh?"
00:01:21.625,00:01:25.041,Will do.
00:01:25.083,00:01:27.458,"- Good morning, Bubbles!!"
00:01:27.500,00:01:29.375,Ready for a great day?
00:01:29.416,00:01:32.000,"Oh, boy, Splash."
00:01:32.041,00:01:35.791,"Oh, I'm sorry, but to be fair, you didn't say how long."
00:01:35.833,00:01:38.833,"Well, I'm up now."
00:01:38.875,00:01:43.250,"So, I was thinking something big and epic."
00:01:43.291,00:01:45.750,"Ah, it sounds like fun."
00:01:45.791,00:01:49.166,What's a big and epic adventure we could have?
00:01:49.208,00:01:52.458,I... have no idea.
00:01:52.500,00:01:54.833,But I'll know it when I see it.
00:01:54.875,00:01:55.958,- Okay.
00:01:59.500,00:02:01.291,"Oh, that looks so beautiful."
00:02:02.750,00:02:04.583,"Psst, psst, psst."
00:02:04.625,00:02:06.583,"- Oh, oh, hi, Maury."
00:02:06.625,00:02:10.166,So have you guys heard the news about Splash?
00:02:10.208,00:02:11.750,News? What news?
00:02:11.791,00:02:21.333,"Well, you didn't hear it from me, Maury, but word on the reef is our friend Splash is looking to leave Reeftown."
00:02:21.375,00:02:23.166,What? Are you sure?
00:02:23.208,00:02:24.541,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:24.583,00:02:28.166,He said he wants to do something big and epic.
00:02:28.208,00:02:32.833,He's probably already planning out his next home far across the ocean.
00:02:32.875,00:02:34.375,"Well, did he say that?"
00:02:34.416,00:02:37.541,Think about it.
00:02:37.583,00:02:39.375,And he's looking for adventure.
00:02:39.416,00:02:43.541,That can only add up to one thing: he's outta here!
00:02:43.583,00:02:46.291,"Well, I gotta go."
00:02:46.333,00:02:49.958,I had no idea that Splash was thinking of leaving Reeftown.
00:02:50.000,00:02:51.666,He seemed so happy here.
00:02:51.708,00:02:54.458,I guess you never can tell with migratory fish.
00:02:54.500,00:02:56.791,"Hiya, guys!"
00:02:56.833,00:02:59.208,"Hey, why so, uh, frowny-finned?"
00:02:59.250,00:03:02.666,"Well, we heard that Splash wants to go on an epic adventure."
00:03:02.708,00:03:05.583,He sure does.
00:03:05.625,00:03:08.291,- So what's so bad about that?
00:03:05.625,00:03:12.000,"- Well, it's just that Splash lived in a lot of places before he came to Reeftown."
00:03:12.041,00:03:13.291,So?
00:03:13.333,00:03:21.833,"So Reeftown is great, but what if while we're out having our epic adventure, Splash discovers some other place to call home?"
00:03:21.875,00:03:24.833,We just won't let that happen.
00:03:24.875,00:03:26.250,How will we stop him?
00:03:26.291,00:03:28.916,We'll keep him right here in Reeftown.
00:03:28.958,00:03:32.166,"If he never goes out there, he'll never find another place to live."
00:03:32.208,00:03:35.166,That's the best plan I've heard all day!
00:03:35.208,00:03:41.833,"Let's show Splash that he can have an epic adventure right here in Reeftown, just hanging with friends."
00:03:41.875,00:03:43.000,Yeah!
00:03:43.041,00:03:44.125,Whoo!
00:03:44.166,00:03:45.500,"Oh, come on!"
00:03:55.625,00:03:59.916,"I'm Splash, a fusilier."
00:03:59.958,00:04:03.500,I'm going global.
00:04:03.541,00:04:07.000,"Bubbles, that's me!"
00:04:07.041,00:04:09.000,Do I like stuff that's gross and gooey?
00:04:09.041,00:04:10.666,You bet!
00:04:17.833,00:04:21.416,I'm the artist known as Dunk.
00:04:25.625,00:04:27.041,"Ripple, I'm a seahorse."
00:04:54.000,00:05:02.541,"So, about that epic adventure we were talking about-- Uh, got one, um, today, we're gonna have an epic Reeftown adventure."
00:05:02.583,00:05:04.791,- Ooh!
00:05:04.833,00:05:08.500,"- Yeah, sure. Follow me."
00:05:04.833,00:05:11.125,"- Okay, but-- - It'll be fun."
00:05:11.166,00:05:14.791,Reeftown Rangers part one.
00:05:14.833,00:05:19.000,- Dorsal Park slide.
00:05:19.041,00:05:21.166,Look out below!
00:05:21.208,00:05:25.000,"Whoa! Look, I'm doing it!"
00:05:25.041,00:05:26.375,Yeah!
00:05:26.416,00:05:28.750,Whoa! Whoa!
00:05:28.791,00:05:30.041,Whoa! Whoo-hoo!
00:05:30.083,00:05:32.833,"- Oh, that was amazing!"
00:05:32.875,00:05:37.000,Whoo-ha!
00:05:37.041,00:05:38.791,Oh! Whoa!
00:05:38.833,00:05:42.875,Whoa! Whoa! Yeah!
00:05:51.291,00:05:55.250,Guess who's here?
00:05:55.291,00:05:57.000,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:05:57.041,00:05:59.000,Whoa!
00:06:01.791,00:06:03.666,"Uh, adventurous, right?"
00:06:03.708,00:06:08.458,"Yeah, that was fun, but I'm thinking we should look for a really big adventure."
00:06:08.500,00:06:09.875,You want a really big adventure?
00:06:13.541,00:06:17.625,Try helping my dad take care of 499 wild seahorse boys.
00:06:17.666,00:06:20.000,"Ripple, have you seen your brothers?"
00:06:20.041,00:06:23.250,Specifically 66 and 278?
00:06:23.291,00:06:24.750,"Well, I'll get them."
00:06:24.791,00:06:28.875,Hermanos!
00:06:28.916,00:06:31.875,"Uh, guys, you'd better get out of the way."
00:06:31.916,00:06:36.083,Why? What does la hora de la merienda mean?
00:06:40.041,00:06:42.666,It means snack time.
00:06:42.708,00:06:49.041,"- What a great adventure - that was, huh, Splash?"
00:06:49.083,00:06:52.958,But don't you guys want to do something huge and epic?
00:06:53.000,00:06:55.958,"Oh, yeah!"
00:06:57.375,00:07:02.875,"Um, as soon as I figure out what it is."
00:07:02.916,00:07:07.208,"Hmm. So, uh, Bubbles, uh, what's the big adventure?"
00:07:07.250,00:07:08.750,Is it-- is there something new here?
00:07:08.791,00:07:11.833,"Well, um, something's bound to come along."
00:07:11.875,00:07:14.708,"Hey, what is that?"
00:07:14.750,00:07:17.125,"Nice try, Bubbles."
00:07:17.166,00:07:24.375,"No, really, there's some sort of strange-looking mysterious jellyfish over there."
00:07:24.416,00:07:26.291,"Oh, well, that is weird."
00:07:26.333,00:07:29.500,"Oh, there is something different about that jellyfish."
00:07:29.541,00:07:33.000,"Well, everyone's mysterious until you get to know them."
00:07:33.041,00:07:34.333,"Hey, let's introduce ourselves."
00:07:34.375,00:07:36.916,"Uh, hello!"
00:07:38.083,00:07:40.750,- Uh.
00:07:40.791,00:07:43.000,"Yeah, um..."
00:07:43.041,00:07:46.000,"Hello, Mysterious Jellyfish!"
00:07:46.041,00:07:48.875,My name is Splash!
00:07:50.166,00:07:52.500,Oh. Hmm.
00:07:52.541,00:07:56.000,What's your name?!
00:07:56.041,00:07:59.833,Its name is Plastic Bag.
00:07:59.875,00:08:01.250,Plastic Bag?
00:08:01.291,00:08:03.583,That's a funny name for a jellyfish.
00:08:03.625,00:08:05.833,This is not a jellyfish at all.
00:08:05.875,00:08:08.125,It's not even part of the ocean.
00:08:08.166,00:08:10.958,It's something from up there.
00:08:11.000,00:08:14.416,Up there?
00:08:14.458,00:08:18.000,Now you know I go to the surface to breathe air.
00:08:18.041,00:08:23.708,"Up there, I've seen these before, but they certainly do not belong down here in the ocean."
00:08:23.750,00:08:25.708,Are you sure it doesn't belong?
00:08:25.750,00:08:27.458,It kind of looks like a jellyfish.
00:08:27.500,00:08:30.875,And that's exactly what makes it so dangerous.
00:08:30.916,00:08:35.625,"Sea turtles, like me, who eat jellyfish, can get confused."
00:08:35.666,00:08:40.083,"And if they get one of these in their tummies, well, they can get very sick."
00:08:40.125,00:08:43.708,"Oh, no. Why would those things be in our ocean?"
00:08:43.750,00:08:46.375,"It's a mystery, my dear Ripple."
00:08:46.416,00:08:52.083,In fact about 95% of what's above the surface is still unexplored.
00:08:52.125,00:08:59.375,But we're hoping they know that we're down here and keep bags like this out of our ocean.
00:08:59.416,00:09:00.833,Can we get rid of this?
00:09:00.875,00:09:04.833,"Well, once it's in the ocean, it's very hard to get rid of."
00:09:04.875,00:09:10.250,"Right now, I'm off to another journey, but I'll take it out of Reeftown on my way."
00:09:10.291,00:09:13.583,"- Where are you going, Flo?"
00:09:10.291,00:09:16.375,- I'm going across the sea to find the beach where I was born.
00:09:16.416,00:09:19.500,Wow.
00:09:19.541,00:09:22.208,Why are you going all the way back there?
00:09:22.250,00:09:24.625,Because that's my first home.
00:09:24.666,00:09:32.750,Now it's time for me to go back there and lay my eggs so that new baby sea turtles can be born there.
00:09:32.791,00:09:35.458,"Now, I'm off on my journey."
00:09:35.500,00:09:39.166,I'll see you when I get back!
00:09:43.541,00:09:45.416,Our epic adventure!
00:09:45.458,00:09:50.291,"We can go catch up to Flo, and-- and find out where her home is!"
00:09:50.333,00:09:53.333,But we don't even know what ocean her home is in.
00:09:53.375,00:09:55.000,It doesn't really matter.
00:09:55.041,00:09:58.041,"I mean, they're all connected in one big ocean!"
00:09:58.083,00:10:03.500,"In fact, if we go far enough, we can travel around the whole world!"
00:10:03.541,00:10:06.166,Wouldn't that be amazing?
00:10:06.208,00:10:07.625,- Ye-a-ah.
00:10:07.666,00:10:09.333,Yeah!
00:10:07.666,00:10:11.458,I'll go ask Wave for some directions about which current to start with.
00:10:11.500,00:10:14.625,"Oh, boy!"
00:10:14.666,00:10:17.916,"Ohh, I'm worried."
00:10:17.958,00:10:19.458,Remember what Maury said?
00:10:19.500,00:10:23.833,"What if we go see the whole ocean, and Splash doesn't want to come back to Reeftown?"
00:10:23.875,00:10:26.416,That would be awful.
00:10:26.458,00:10:30.125,"Ahh, but Splash loves Reeftown."
00:10:30.166,00:10:31.916,That's a relief.
00:10:31.958,00:10:36.083,But of course he hasn't seen the whole world.
00:10:36.125,00:10:38.666,We can't go!
00:10:38.708,00:10:41.916,"Ahh, but we're Reeftown Rangers!"
00:10:41.958,00:10:44.083,We are supposed to explore.
00:10:44.125,00:10:48.875,"Guys, make up your mind."
00:10:48.916,00:10:50.583,"Come on, Reeftown Rangers."
00:10:50.625,00:10:53.500,Who's ready for our big ocean adventure?
00:10:53.541,00:10:56.875,- I am!
00:12:04.500,00:12:11.916,"Okay, um, let's see, uh, I spy with my fishy eye something purple."
00:12:11.958,00:12:14.416,- You'll never find it.
00:12:14.458,00:12:16.666,- Ha ha ha.
00:12:16.708,00:12:19.291,- Is it those purple urchins?
00:12:19.333,00:12:20.916,"Okay, your turn, Bubbles."
00:12:20.958,00:12:23.000,"Ah, okay, I got one."
00:12:23.041,00:12:29.458,I spy with my fishy eye something yellow and blue.
00:12:29.500,00:12:30.541,Ooh! Is it me?
00:12:30.583,00:12:32.791,- Nope.
00:12:32.833,00:12:34.916,Oh! Is it that school of blue tang?
00:12:34.958,00:12:37.750,Wha-- it is!
00:12:37.791,00:12:39.958,"All right, all right."
00:12:40.000,00:12:48.000,"Let's see, uh, I spy with my fishy eye something-- Flo?"
00:12:48.041,00:12:49.416,Something Flo?
00:12:49.458,00:12:52.625,- Yeah.
00:12:52.666,00:12:54.416,I think we found her up there on the current.
00:12:54.458,00:12:57.083,"Well, it's definitely a turtle."
00:12:57.125,00:12:59.583,- Yeah.
00:12:59.625,00:13:00.708,it doesn't look like Flo.
00:13:00.750,00:13:03.416,- Hmm.
00:13:03.458,00:13:06.083,"Oh, hey. I'm Scoot."
00:13:06.125,00:13:08.666,"- Oh, hi, my name's Du-- - Ooh, nice stripe."
00:13:08.708,00:13:11.291,That reminds me of a blue coral I once saw.
00:13:11.333,00:13:14.166,Do you guys like coral?
00:13:14.208,00:13:16.625,"Oh, be right back!"
00:13:16.666,00:13:18.375,Wha-- is he gone?
00:13:18.416,00:13:21.666,Better question-- is he out here all alone?
00:13:21.708,00:13:24.125,"Oh, well, maybe he lives around here."
00:13:24.166,00:13:27.333,"Uh, I'm back!"
00:13:27.375,00:13:29.625,Do you know what I love?
00:13:29.666,00:13:32.083,Don't you just love jellyfish?
00:13:32.125,00:13:34.500,"Uh, yeah, I like jellyfish."
00:13:34.541,00:13:37.208,"Uh, are there a lot of jellyfish out here where you live?"
00:13:37.250,00:13:40.083,"Yeah, I guess so."
00:13:40.125,00:13:42.000,And there's a lot of jellyfish in the ocean.
00:13:42.041,00:13:44.458,"Right, well, we all live in the ocean."
00:13:44.500,00:13:46.083,But where do you live?
00:13:46.125,00:13:49.458,"You know, like, we live in a place called Reeftown."
00:13:49.500,00:13:52.375,"Oh, I've swum past reefs."
00:13:52.416,00:13:54.875,I just kinda live wherever.
00:13:54.916,00:13:58.458,You don't have a home?
00:13:58.500,00:14:02.750,"No, I'm a big boy now."
00:14:02.791,00:14:09.625,"Scoot, uh, there's a bunch of fish that are about-- Scoot, buddy, seriously, you need to turn around."
00:14:09.666,00:14:12.166,I've just kinda been riding the currents...
00:14:12.208,00:14:14.666,- Whoa!
00:14:12.208,00:14:16.083,"- And seeing where they take me, and that's just how I like it."
00:14:16.125,00:14:17.791,"Yeah. See, guys?"
00:14:17.833,00:14:21.041,That's just the sense of adventure I was talking about.
00:14:21.083,00:14:23.625,We're on a bit of adventure ourselves.
00:14:23.666,00:14:28.125,We're going around the whole big ocean looking for our friend.
00:14:28.166,00:14:30.250,She's a sea turtle just like you.
00:14:30.291,00:14:32.416,like so much fun!
00:14:32.458,00:14:34.666,It's been a while since I went all the way around the world.
00:14:34.708,00:14:37.291,I tend to stick more to the warmer parts if I can.
00:14:37.333,00:14:43.916,"When I get too chilly, my shell starts-- I just don't know how you do this, Scoot."
00:14:43.958,00:14:48.166,"I've only been gone from Reeftown a little while, and I'm already homesick!"
00:14:48.208,00:14:50.083,"Well, that's no big deal."
00:14:50.125,00:14:51.875,It's just what we baby sea turtles do.
00:14:51.916,00:14:56.125,"Travel and grow and learn to survive for two, up to ten years."
00:14:56.166,00:14:58.000,"But after that, you'll have a home?"
00:14:58.041,00:15:01.083,"Maybe, but I already have a home, remember?"
00:15:01.125,00:15:03.291,The whole ocean is my home.
00:15:03.333,00:15:08.375,"I don't have to call one place my home, when I can call every place my home!"
00:15:08.416,00:15:11.125,"Wow, that sounds amazing!"
00:15:11.166,00:15:17.000,"Oh, I love seeing different places and meeting new friends, just like you!"
00:15:17.041,00:15:21.291,"Guys, it seems like Splash is having a lot of fun so far!"
00:15:21.333,00:15:23.583,"Yeah, maybe too much fun."
00:15:23.625,00:15:27.041,He may want to keep traveling this whole big ocean with Scoot.
00:15:27.083,00:15:30.041,"Well, it's not doing us any good to worry right now."
00:15:30.083,00:15:33.000,Let's just have fun with Splash on this adventure.
00:15:33.041,00:15:35.750,Yeah.
00:15:35.791,00:15:43.500,"You know, he is our friend and if traveling around this big ocean makes him happy, then we should all support that."
00:15:43.541,00:15:45.791,"- Yeah, come on."
00:15:43.541,00:15:51.833,"- And then, this one time, I swam right near this whirlpool, and I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:15:51.875,00:15:53.916,"- Then, I was okay."
00:15:53.958,00:15:55.958,- Just a little dizzy.
00:15:56.000,00:16:00.333,"I had seen a lot of stuff, but you're only three-- - Uh-uh. Almost four."
00:16:00.375,00:16:03.500,And you've already seen so much more than I have.
00:16:03.541,00:16:05.916,"- Oh, you're so lucky!"
00:16:05.958,00:16:08.541,"- But you're really lucky, too."
00:16:08.583,00:16:11.625,"Well, you have all these really nice friends with you all the time."
00:16:11.666,00:16:17.500,"I love travelling, but I also love-- And there he goes again."
00:16:17.541,00:16:20.291,"- So should we wait, or-- - I love travelling."
00:16:20.333,00:16:27.416,- But I also love to talk and play games and there are only so many times you can play chase your tail before that gets old.
00:16:27.458,00:16:29.041,"Where are you, tail?"
00:16:29.083,00:16:30.875,"Oh, I know you're back there somewhere!"
00:16:30.916,00:16:31.958,See what I mean?
00:16:32.000,00:16:34.375,- Here's a thought.
00:16:34.416,00:16:36.291,"We're all looking for Flo, right?"
00:16:36.333,00:16:40.625,"And Scoot is looking for some new friends to play with, huh?"
00:16:40.666,00:16:43.666,So he can come with us on our adventure.
00:16:43.708,00:16:45.625,"Hey, great idea, Bubbles."
00:16:45.666,00:16:47.875,"Great idea, Bubba."
00:16:47.916,00:16:50.250,"Uh, Bubbles."
00:16:50.291,00:16:52.250,"Yeah, we're best friends."
00:16:54.583,00:16:58.750,"Well, if you love having friends, you're gonna love our friend Flo, the sea turtle."
00:16:58.791,00:17:04.166,"She's been around for a long time, so she could teach you the best ways to stay safe - and out of trouble!"
00:17:04.208,00:17:06.583,Why would I need help with that?
00:17:06.625,00:17:09.708,"- Uh, no reason."
00:17:09.750,00:17:11.875,"Let's do this, Reeftown Rangers."
00:17:11.916,00:17:18.083,"And, uh, honorary Ocean friends forever!"
00:17:18.125,00:17:22.500,"And ever and ever and ever and ever and-- oh, sorry, it's my first club."
00:17:22.541,00:17:24.041,It's okay.
00:17:24.083,00:17:26.000,"So, uh, what do you wanna do first?"
00:17:26.041,00:17:28.416,Do you guys like to play games?
00:17:31.166,00:17:32.416,What don't we like to play?
00:17:32.458,00:17:37.416,"Uh, there's hide-and-seek, finball, ooh, exploring tunnels."
00:17:37.458,00:17:39.375,Ooh!
00:17:39.416,00:17:45.833,"- Oh, uh-- That's not a tunnel!"
00:17:45.875,00:17:48.750,Save that turtle!
00:17:48.791,00:17:52.375,"- We're coming, Scoot!"
00:17:55.333,00:17:57.125,I guess he really did find a tunnel.
00:17:59.000,00:18:01.208,Bet you can't catch me!
00:18:03.125,00:18:05.166,This kid's a ball of energy.
00:18:05.208,00:18:07.000,"Oh, don't worry."
00:18:07.041,00:18:09.916,Come on.
00:18:09.958,00:18:11.416,- Ooh-wee!
00:18:11.458,00:18:13.875,"Like I was saying, he'll tire himself out."
00:18:13.916,00:18:15.208,- Any minute.
00:18:15.250,00:18:17.083,- I hope.
00:18:17.125,00:18:18.791,"Okay, now what, best friends?"
00:18:18.833,00:18:21.208,"Uh, I don't know, Scoot."
00:18:18.833,00:18:23.416,"How about, um-- - Huh?"
00:18:23.458,00:18:25.750,Now that is a good idea.
00:18:25.791,00:18:28.041,"No, that is my lunch."
00:18:28.083,00:18:30.416,- A jellyfish. Yum!
00:18:30.458,00:18:32.458,It's another one of those plastic bags!
00:18:32.500,00:18:34.708,- Yeah.
00:18:34.750,00:18:38.166,"Oh, this is the strangest jellyfish I've ever seen."
00:18:38.208,00:18:40.583,That's because it's not a jellyfish.
00:18:40.625,00:18:43.625,That's right!
00:18:43.666,00:18:46.208,"Now go away, plastic bag."
00:18:47.833,00:18:50.125,"Fine, be that way."
00:18:50.166,00:18:51.625,"Come on, come on, pal."
00:18:51.666,00:18:53.250,"Hey, what about my lunch?"
00:18:53.291,00:18:56.166,"Uh, well, eating that would hurt your belly, okay?"
00:18:56.208,00:18:58.833,"- Besides, wouldn't you rather-- - But I'm hungry!"
00:18:58.875,00:19:02.791,"No, no, I'm tired."
00:19:02.833,00:19:05.125,I wanna play.
00:19:05.166,00:19:11.166,"All right, all right, how about we play in the ooey, gooey algae puddle, huh?"
00:19:11.208,00:19:15.000,- Do you really wanna do that?
00:19:15.041,00:19:20.916,"I know it might be a little weird, but I like to splish and sploosh in muddy puddles."
00:19:20.958,00:19:23.875,Whoo-hoo!
00:19:23.916,00:19:26.416,"Really, Bubbles?"
00:19:26.458,00:19:30.083,Like it? I love it!
00:20:04.166,00:20:06.083,Unh-unh!
00:20:38.208,00:20:39.916,"Uh, Scoot?"
00:20:39.958,00:20:40.958,Where'd he go?
00:20:41.000,00:20:43.166,- Shells away!
00:20:45.083,00:20:46.416,So what do you think?
00:20:46.458,00:20:48.458,I love it!
00:20:48.500,00:20:50.458,all day!
00:20:52.250,00:20:54.250,Eh?
00:20:56.291,00:20:59.166,Whee!
00:20:59.208,00:21:04.250,"Ohh, whoa! Oh! Yahoo!"
00:21:04.291,00:21:06.208,"Boy, he was not kidding."
00:21:06.250,00:21:08.958,He really could do this all day.
00:21:09.000,00:21:12.583,"But we need to get going and catch up to Flo, - right, guys? Guys?"
00:21:12.625,00:21:15.208,I love it so much!
00:21:12.625,00:21:22.000,"I love it more than-- The big, white bubble."
00:21:22.041,00:21:25.333,"Wow, it's so beautiful!"
00:21:25.375,00:21:32.000,"When I first crawled out of the sand, the first thing I saw was the big, white bubble in the sky."
00:21:32.041,00:21:35.208,It's almost like my oldest friend.
00:21:35.250,00:21:41.041,But that's not as good - Aww.
00:21:41.083,00:21:42.541,"Thanks, Scoot."
00:21:42.583,00:21:45.875,"Huh. You know, I've always wondered..."
00:21:45.916,00:21:47.666,what do you think it is?
00:21:47.708,00:21:51.625,so that we can see at night.
00:21:51.666,00:21:54.583,"'Cause otherwise, it'd be so dark."
00:21:54.625,00:21:57.875,"Maybe, but I think it's even more than that."
00:21:57.916,00:22:00.958,It's something we can all share together.
00:22:01.000,00:22:05.208,Like how I can see it and so can my Papa back home.
00:22:05.250,00:22:13.875,"Hmm, makes you wonder about all the places in the ocean you can look up and all see the same light - up there at night."
00:22:13.916,00:22:17.125,That's because we all live in one big ocean.
00:22:17.166,00:22:20.208,"- Right, Splash?"
00:22:22.166,00:22:27.291,"normally, yellowback fusiliers like me don't need much sleep, but I am beat."
00:22:27.333,00:22:29.958,I feel like we've been traveling all day.
00:22:30.000,00:22:31.208,"Oh, wait, we have."
00:22:32.583,00:22:33.916,- But you know what?
00:22:33.958,00:22:40.208,"Even though we traveled far from Reeftown, having you all around makes it feel like home."
00:22:40.250,00:22:42.208,Don't you think?
00:22:44.833,00:22:47.750,Aww.
00:22:47.791,00:22:52.625,"good night, bright bubble."
00:22:53.875,00:22:55.583,"- Good night, guys."
00:01:15.583,00:01:18.291,Oh! I love the deep.
00:01:18.333,00:01:24.166,"Ooh, I know, and I can't wait to see what kind of fun expedition Lu has planned for us today."
00:01:24.208,00:01:27.750,And I can't wait to see all the new and interesting creatures we'll find in the deep!
00:01:27.791,00:01:32.166,And I just can't wait to see.
00:01:32.208,00:01:35.583,"Lu and Bob live right around here, but I don't see them anywhere."
00:01:35.625,00:01:37.750,"- This way, sweetheart."
00:01:37.791,00:01:40.083,"- Okay, Bob."
00:01:43.375,00:01:46.916,"- Okay, steady as she goes."
00:01:50.125,00:01:51.583,"Ah, no problem."
00:01:51.625,00:01:53.583,- A little further.
00:01:53.625,00:01:56.000,- Okay.
00:01:53.625,00:01:58.666,"- Normally, she's easy to find with her bright bioluminescent light."
00:01:58.708,00:02:01.375,Oh!
00:02:01.416,00:02:03.625,That sounds like Bob's voice.
00:02:03.666,00:02:04.958,I think it came from this way.
00:02:05.000,00:02:06.291,- What?
00:02:08.333,00:02:10.708,"No, no, back-- back this way."
00:02:10.750,00:02:12.666,"Whoa, kids, over here!"
00:02:12.708,00:02:14.500,"- Oh, okay, back over here."
00:02:14.541,00:02:15.833,"- Uh, maybe over here."
00:02:15.875,00:02:17.958,"- Kids, over here."
00:02:18.000,00:02:19.125,"Oh, oh."
00:02:19.166,00:02:21.750,- Oh.
00:02:21.791,00:02:23.250,"Hi, Lu."
00:02:23.291,00:02:25.541,We've been looking everywhere for you.
00:02:27.708,00:02:30.125,"Lu, are you okay?"
00:02:30.166,00:02:32.166,You don't seem like yourself today.
00:02:32.208,00:02:35.333,"Yeah, we couldn't find you because your light's not on."
00:02:35.375,00:02:39.125,"Well, that's just it, guys."
00:02:39.166,00:02:40.500,- What?
00:02:40.541,00:02:42.666,- No!
00:02:42.708,00:02:47.250,"I wish I knew, but the light in my esca just won't come on."
00:02:47.291,00:02:49.500,"Oh, no, poor Lu."
00:02:49.541,00:02:52.791,"First her light goes out, now her esca doesn't work!"
00:02:52.833,00:02:54.625,What's an esca?
00:02:54.666,00:02:59.916,"The esca is where the light actually comes from, so it's kind of one in the same."
00:02:59.958,00:03:02.750,"Kinda like you and me, eh, buttercup?"
00:03:02.791,00:03:04.791,"Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Bobby."
00:03:04.833,00:03:10.833,"If I could only be fused with one fish in the whole ocean, I'm glad it's you."
00:03:10.875,00:03:13.875,"Aw, well, how long has your light been out, Lu?"
00:03:13.916,00:03:15.166,Just since yesterday.
00:03:15.208,00:03:20.541,Bob and I were down here in the deep - playing around in some mud...
00:03:20.583,00:03:25.208,"And then, poof, my light just goes right out."
00:03:25.250,00:03:27.166,Ow. Ooh.
00:03:27.208,00:03:30.291,And I haven't been able to get it to work since then.
00:03:30.333,00:03:32.083,"- Well, don't worry, Lu."
00:03:32.125,00:03:33.791,We'll figure something out.
00:03:33.833,00:03:37.041,"Um, is there a way to add some new light to your esca?"
00:03:37.083,00:03:39.166,"I wish, but not really."
00:03:39.208,00:03:44.416,The light in my esca comes from this bioluminescent bacteria.
00:03:44.458,00:03:47.250,"Well, did the bacteria leave your esca?"
00:03:47.291,00:03:49.125,"Maybe, but I'm not sure why."
00:03:49.166,00:03:52.916,I thought we had a pretty good symbiotic relationship going.
00:03:52.958,00:03:58.291,"I give the bacteria a place to live, and they give me light."
00:03:58.333,00:04:00.416,Sounds like a good deal to me.
00:04:00.458,00:04:04.166,you'll always be the light of my life.
00:04:04.208,00:04:05.583,- Aww.
00:04:05.625,00:04:07.416,"Oh, honey, you gotta watch the face."
00:04:07.458,00:04:09.958,It's all I got left.
00:04:10.000,00:04:11.791,I didn't see that one there.
00:04:11.833,00:04:17.125,"But, Lu, if you can't see down here in the deep, how will you get any food?"
00:04:17.166,00:04:20.208,"Yeah, I mean, the esca lures food to your light."
00:04:20.250,00:04:21.916,"Tell me about it, kids."
00:04:21.958,00:04:25.375,"Since my light went out, I haven't eaten a thing."
00:04:25.416,00:04:33.083,"- Hey, I know a place where there's plenty of food and it's easy to see, even without the light in your esca."
00:04:33.125,00:04:34.541,Wh-- where?
00:04:34.583,00:04:36.375,Reeftown!
00:04:36.416,00:04:38.000,Reeftown?
00:04:38.041,00:04:41.041,But that's up in the bright sun.
00:04:41.083,00:04:43.541,I've never been up there before.
00:04:43.583,00:04:50.666,"Ah, yeah, but there's plenty of new places for a fearless explorer like you to discover, Lu."
00:04:50.708,00:04:52.875,And lots of new creatures.
00:04:52.916,00:04:59.416,And you already have four friends up there who can teach you everything there is to know about living up in the light.
00:04:59.458,00:05:02.166,"Aw, really?"
00:05:02.208,00:05:06.250,"Of course, it's the least we can do after all you've done for us."
00:05:06.291,00:05:14.458,"That's very nice of you, kiddos, but I don't know if football fish were meant to live in the bright sun."
00:05:14.500,00:05:16.250,"What do you think, Bobby?"
00:05:16.291,00:05:21.083,"I think if you can't find any food down here, maybe it's time to move on to brighter seas."
00:05:21.125,00:05:23.750,- Am I right?
00:05:23.791,00:05:29.041,I guess it couldn't hurt to see things from the sunny side of the ocean.
00:05:39.291,00:05:41.583,- Whoa!
00:05:41.625,00:05:44.833,"Sweet, salty water, it's bright up here!"
00:05:44.875,00:05:49.500,"Oh, kids, did you take us to Reeftown or just put us on the surface of the sun?"
00:05:49.541,00:05:52.208,"Oh, how do you see in all this light?"
00:05:52.250,00:05:54.333,But we're not even in Reeftown yet.
00:05:54.375,00:05:56.625,This isn't even full sunlight.
00:05:56.666,00:05:58.458,I gotta get outta here.
00:05:58.500,00:06:00.166,I'm right beside you.
00:06:00.208,00:06:02.416,"- Lu and Bob, uh..."
00:06:02.458,00:06:06.333,"- I'm sorry, Lu. Are you okay?"
00:06:06.375,00:06:13.458,"Oh, I'll be fine, Splash-a-rooni, but I'm afraid we may not be able to live in Reeftown after all."
00:06:13.500,00:06:14.708,Why not?
00:06:14.750,00:06:21.666,"Well, Dunk, our eyes are made to see in the dark, dark, deep, and not up here in the bright, bright, light."
00:06:21.708,00:06:26.416,"Oh, well, I'm sorry my idea didn't work out for you, Lu."
00:06:26.458,00:06:30.916,"Oh, it was a good idea, Dunk, but we'll have to figure something else out."
00:06:30.958,00:06:32.916,"No worries, little pufferoo."
00:06:32.958,00:06:40.250,"Lu, you may not like it here, but being up in the bright sunlight, you can see things you may not have seen before."
00:06:40.291,00:06:43.125,"Oh, yeah?"
00:06:43.166,00:06:49.583,"Well, like the fact that your esca is covered with icky, sticky mud."
00:06:49.625,00:06:51.208,"Bubbles, you're right!"
00:06:51.250,00:06:52.750,Lu's light never went out.
00:06:52.791,00:06:56.333,"It's just coated in icky, clumpy mud."
00:06:56.375,00:06:59.416,"Oh, my goodness gracious!"
00:06:59.458,00:07:04.791,"Bobby, we must have gotten it covered in mud yesterday when we were playing."
00:07:04.833,00:07:06.291,I think you're right.
00:07:06.333,00:07:09.333,Now the question is how do we get it off?
00:07:11.875,00:07:16.041,You happen to be in the presence of a mud expert.
00:07:17.250,00:07:20.083,Let me at that ooey-gooey mud.
00:07:20.125,00:07:23.750,"Ah, take that?"
00:07:23.791,00:07:25.041,"Okay, how about this?"
00:07:25.083,00:07:27.041,Huh?
00:07:28.583,00:07:30.875,"All right, no more Mrs. Nice Fish."
00:07:30.916,00:07:33.083,"Take this, you mud."
00:07:35.833,00:07:37.000,Yeah. Uh...
00:07:37.041,00:07:39.791,Ah-- I'm out of ideas.
00:07:39.833,00:07:42.125,"Oh, well, that's okay, Bubbles."
00:07:42.166,00:07:48.125,"You may be an expert on mud, but there's someone else who's an expert on cleaning off dirty, clumpy messes."
00:07:48.166,00:07:51.041,- Who?
00:07:52.875,00:07:55.041,"Maury, I don't know where you come up with this stuff."
00:07:55.083,00:07:57.791,"- Ah, come on."
00:07:57.833,00:07:59.875,Now I know you're just pulling my claw.
00:07:59.916,00:08:03.375,Denny? Denny!
00:08:03.416,00:08:07.541,- I have a cleaning emergency.
00:08:07.583,00:08:10.166,I just need to...
00:08:10.208,00:08:12.416,And Maury's all done.
00:08:12.458,00:08:16.333,"Ah, thanks, Denny."
00:08:16.375,00:08:17.833,"Oh, my pleasure."
00:08:17.875,00:08:20.500,"Okay, so what's this emergency, Splash?"
00:08:20.541,00:08:23.458,"Well, I'll show you."
00:08:23.500,00:08:24.666,Okay.
00:08:24.708,00:08:26.958,"Bye, Maury."
00:08:27.000,00:08:30.083,"Bye, Denny, see you soon!"
00:08:30.125,00:08:33.666,"If anyone can make this better, - it's Denny."
00:08:33.708,00:08:35.333,"Yeah, she'll figure out what it is."
00:08:35.375,00:08:38.041,What's happening?
00:08:38.083,00:08:41.125,"Hmm, interesting."
00:08:41.166,00:08:44.875,"Ah, do you think you'll be able to get the mud off of Lu's esca?"
00:08:44.916,00:08:46.708,It's some pretty thick mud.
00:08:46.750,00:08:49.500,"It sure is, but that's not a problem."
00:08:49.541,00:08:52.833,I eat parasites that are thicker than this for breakfast.
00:08:54.208,00:08:57.000,"No, seriously. I do."
00:08:59.208,00:09:01.208,"Oh, it sounds bad."
00:09:01.250,00:09:03.083,"Does it hurt, buttercup?"
00:09:03.125,00:09:06.458,"No, actually, it, uh, feels much better."
00:09:06.500,00:09:10.291,That's because you're all clean!
00:09:10.333,00:09:12.083,- Ah.
00:09:13.541,00:09:15.416,"Hey, look at that light go."
00:09:15.458,00:09:18.000,It hasn't been this bright in years.
00:09:18.041,00:09:20.208,"Yeah, there was a lot of build-up on it."
00:09:20.250,00:09:23.416,You should go see the cleaner shrimp more often.
00:09:23.458,00:09:25.083,"Well, maybe I will."
00:09:25.125,00:09:29.083,"Or, better yet, you can come see me sometime."
00:09:29.125,00:09:31.500,- These guys know the way.
00:09:31.541,00:09:34.916,"Speaking of, let's give that new esca a spin."
00:09:34.958,00:09:37.625,- What do you say?
00:09:37.666,00:09:39.791,"Yeah, let's do it!"
00:09:39.833,00:09:41.291,- We're ready.
00:09:41.333,00:09:43.833,"Aw, kids, thanks again."
00:09:43.875,00:09:50.083,It feels so much better to have my little old esca back and shining bright again.
00:09:50.125,00:09:53.708,And it feels better for us to be able to see when we're down here with you.
00:09:53.750,00:09:56.166,You said it.
00:09:56.208,00:09:57.791,You loving all this light?
00:09:57.833,00:10:00.666,"Oh, all the better to see you with, my dear."
00:10:02.000,00:10:03.750,"But, uh, I am still a little hungry."
00:10:03.791,00:10:08.833,You think we can use that new light in your esca - to find us some food?
00:10:08.875,00:10:16.041,"Now my esca's working again, we should have no trouble shining a light on our home sweet home."
00:10:17.750,00:10:19.041,We love the deep.
00:11:07.083,00:11:08.708,- Brr.
00:11:20.625,00:11:23.958,"- Don't we, friends?"
00:11:34.958,00:11:36.875,"Good job, Bob."
00:11:38.708,00:11:40.375,- Ha ha!
00:12:03.333,00:12:05.666,Whoopee!
00:12:05.708,00:12:09.166,"Mud, sweet mud."
00:12:10.833,00:12:18.791,"I could spend all day a-swimming and a-floating in this perfectly mucky, yucky mud."
00:12:18.833,00:12:23.083,I love mud!
00:12:54.916,00:12:56.833,Unh-unh!
00:13:27.083,00:13:29.958,"- Bubbles, there you are."
00:13:30.000,00:13:33.750,"Ah, slime slugs."
00:13:33.791,00:13:38.791,"Well, we didn't wanna spoil your mud party, Bubbles, but, yeah, it's kind of that time."
00:13:38.833,00:13:40.958,- Aren't you getting tired?
00:13:41.000,00:13:46.333,"If I had it my way, I'd stay up all night and never go to sleep."
00:13:46.375,00:13:48.958,"Yeah, I don't think I could stay up all night long."
00:13:49.000,00:13:50.833,I'd fall asleep in my sand art.
00:13:50.875,00:13:53.333,"Bubbles, every fish has to go to sleep when it's dark out."
00:13:53.375,00:13:55.833,"It's just, well, the way it is here in the ocean."
00:13:55.875,00:14:00.000,"Oh, you guys might wanna check your fin facts on that one."
00:14:00.041,00:14:02.666,"- Hi, Zee!"
00:14:02.708,00:14:06.833,"Well, not every fish in Reeftown goes to sleep at night."
00:14:06.875,00:14:10.083,"- What are you saying, Zee?"
00:14:10.125,00:14:13.333,I'd like to meet this fish that stays awake all night long.
00:14:13.375,00:14:16.875,Ahem. Hello? It's me.
00:14:16.916,00:14:20.416,Your friendly neighborhood zebra bullhead shark.
00:14:20.458,00:14:22.208,"- Whoa, that's amazing!"
00:14:22.250,00:14:24.791,That's right.
00:14:24.833,00:14:26.416,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:26.458,00:14:28.708,Get back to the part where you stay up all night.
00:14:28.750,00:14:31.208,"Oh, well, that's what nocturnal means."
00:14:31.250,00:14:34.833,"I sleep most of the day, and I'm awake at night."
00:14:34.875,00:14:37.833,See?
00:14:37.875,00:14:42.166,I told you there was a way for me to stay up and play and play!
00:14:42.208,00:14:44.375,"Hold your fins, Bubbles."
00:14:44.416,00:14:51.708,"Zee is nocturnal, but we are definitely diurnal, which means we're awake during the day and we go to sleep at night."
00:14:51.750,00:14:56.000,"But, Splash, you're a fusilier, and you said that fusilier's don't need much sleep."
00:14:56.041,00:15:01.750,"Well, true, but even schooling fish like fusiliers have to get some rest at night."
00:15:01.791,00:15:08.041,"of getting rest at night, I think it's time for all of us to go home and get some sleep."
00:15:08.083,00:15:10.250,"- Yeah, okay, guys, good night."
00:15:10.291,00:15:13.416,- Good night!
00:15:18.416,00:15:21.750,"Ooh, yeah!"
00:15:24.166,00:15:26.083,"Good night, Dunk."
00:15:26.125,00:15:29.250,"Good night, Ripple."
00:15:29.291,00:15:31.833,"Aww, you too, buddy."
00:15:31.875,00:15:33.416,- Splash!
00:15:33.458,00:15:35.958,- I got an idea.
00:15:36.000,00:15:38.416,What would you say...
00:15:38.458,00:15:40.708,if I decided to become...
00:15:40.750,00:15:43.458,nocturnal?
00:15:43.500,00:15:45.916,Uh... not okay.
00:15:45.958,00:15:48.708,- Why not?
00:15:45.958,00:15:53.041,"- Well, Bubbles, for one, you are not nocturnal, and two, since I've known you, you've never stayed up all night."
00:15:53.083,00:15:57.083,"How do you know you're not nocturnal - until you tried it, huh?"
00:15:54.791,00:15:59.625,"- Bubbles, please tell me you are not thinking about staying up all night tonight."
00:15:59.666,00:16:04.916,"Oh, Splash, of course I'm not thinking about staying up all night tonight."
00:16:04.958,00:16:06.416,"- Oh, good, okay."
00:16:06.458,00:16:09.583,I am staying up all night tonight.
00:16:09.625,00:16:11.750,- What?
00:16:11.791,00:16:13.833,"- No, but, Bubbles-- - All right, catch you later!"
00:16:13.875,00:16:18.958,"Yeah, but, Bubbles, did you ask Zee if you could-- - Much later!"
00:16:19.000,00:16:22.000,"well, better get some sleep while I can."
00:16:24.791,00:16:26.375,"- Okay, so that's done."
00:16:26.416,00:16:29.833,- I've decided to join you!
00:16:29.875,00:16:31.125,I have.
00:16:31.166,00:16:33.625,I'm gonna be nocturnal just like you.
00:16:33.666,00:16:36.666,- You are?
00:16:36.708,00:16:40.500,"Um, Bubbles, I'm not sure that's such a good idea."
00:16:40.541,00:16:41.583,Why not?
00:16:41.625,00:16:43.291,We can have so much fun together.
00:16:43.333,00:16:47.833,"Well, I don't think being nocturnal is something you can just decide to be."
00:16:47.875,00:16:50.375,Try me.
00:16:50.416,00:16:56.500,"Hmm, well, I guess it would be fun to have another friend to swim around Reeftown with at night."
00:16:56.541,00:16:59.416,Fintastic!
00:16:59.458,00:17:02.625,Let's get this slumber party started.
00:17:02.666,00:17:05.416,"Except for the slumber part, right?"
00:17:05.458,00:17:07.333,Right.
00:17:07.375,00:17:11.625,"But, um, being nocturnal isn't really a party all night."
00:17:11.666,00:17:14.458,"I mean, I have lots of important things to do."
00:17:14.500,00:17:16.666,Really?
00:17:16.708,00:17:18.583,"Well, I look for food."
00:17:18.625,00:17:20.083,"Ah, that could be fun."
00:17:20.125,00:17:22.708,I check out new hiding spots.
00:17:22.750,00:17:25.750,"Ooh, great."
00:17:25.791,00:17:27.875,I make sure my home is clean.
00:17:27.916,00:17:31.583,Uh... wha-- love it.
00:17:31.625,00:17:34.916,And I figure out ways to stay safe from predators.
00:17:34.958,00:17:38.291,"Whoa, what happened to the playing part?"
00:17:38.333,00:17:45.166,"Well, when you're nocturnal, there are lots of things you need to do at night, and then, if there's time, you can play."
00:17:45.208,00:17:50.458,"Hmm, sounds like all the things that you do at night, we diurnal fish do during the day."
00:17:50.500,00:17:57.583,"Pretty much, but the reef looks and sounds a whole lot different in the middle of the night."
00:17:57.625,00:17:59.708,It's really beautiful.
00:17:59.750,00:18:00.958,Cool.
00:18:01.000,00:18:03.500,It sure is.
00:18:03.541,00:18:07.541,And I'll show you all sorts of surprises.
00:18:07.583,00:18:11.875,"Ah, Zee, the water looks so different at night."
00:18:11.916,00:18:15.583,"Ah, I'm glad you're getting a chance to see it, Bubbles."
00:18:15.625,00:18:17.708,"Aww, me too."
00:18:17.750,00:18:20.458,"Right this way, the tour continues."
00:18:20.500,00:18:22.666,- All right then.
00:18:22.708,00:18:24.625,So cool. Ow!
00:18:24.666,00:18:26.291,"Ooh, careful, Bubbles."
00:18:26.333,00:18:30.708,"You know, your eyes may not be used to the change in colors at night."
00:18:30.750,00:18:36.083,"I can't see so well, and, uh, I can't swim so fast either."
00:18:36.125,00:18:39.750,"Hey, Zee, how can you swim so fast at night?"
00:18:39.791,00:18:45.708,"Well, because at night, I use my electroreception and other senses to help me swim and get around the reef."
00:18:45.750,00:18:48.750,"- Well, hello, girls."
00:18:48.791,00:18:52.208,"Bubbles, what a surprise to see you wide awake at night."
00:18:52.250,00:18:55.333,"Ah, not as surprised as I am to see you."
00:18:55.375,00:18:58.041,"Denny, I had no idea you were nocturnal."
00:18:58.083,00:19:01.250,Sure am.
00:18:58.083,00:19:08.000,"Those parasites in Maury's mouth are a delicious treat during the day, but at night, I like to go out and smell for my food with my antennae."
00:19:08.041,00:19:09.916,Hey.
00:19:09.958,00:19:13.541,Maybe I could go out and start sniffing for my food.
00:19:13.583,00:19:17.291,- Ha ha!
00:19:17.333,00:19:18.583,- Agh!
00:19:18.625,00:19:20.833,Ow.
00:19:20.875,00:19:25.125,Whoa!
00:19:25.166,00:19:28.333,Just a little dizzy but still nocturnal.
00:19:28.375,00:19:32.166,- Maybe we should rethink this.
00:19:32.208,00:19:34.333,"Aw, don't worry about me, Zee."
00:19:34.375,00:19:36.458,I'm totally fine.
00:19:36.500,00:19:38.708,Let's keep exploring Reeftown at night.
00:19:38.750,00:19:40.333,Okay.
00:19:40.375,00:19:42.000,"- Bye, Denny."
00:19:42.041,00:19:43.833,"- Oh, bye, girls."
00:19:43.875,00:19:46.541,"Oh, I'm fine."
00:19:46.583,00:19:48.416,"Oh, good luck, Bubbles."
00:19:48.458,00:19:53.041,Whoa. What is all this?
00:19:53.083,00:19:56.083,"Ah, Mayor Sting must have burrowed around here somewhere."
00:19:56.125,00:20:00.750,He makes these sand pits at night when he looks for food.
00:20:00.791,00:20:03.875,"Well, hello there, Bubbles."
00:20:03.916,00:20:06.666,Wow!
00:20:06.708,00:20:11.458,"Sure am, and it's a beautiful Big Bright Bubble night tonight."
00:20:11.500,00:20:16.041,Perfect time to patrol and protect the citizens of Reeftown.
00:20:16.083,00:20:17.666,"- How are you, Bubbles?"
00:20:17.708,00:20:19.083,Aah.
00:20:19.125,00:20:21.750,I'm totally up.
00:20:21.791,00:20:23.708,Where are we going next?
00:20:23.750,00:20:26.000,"Oh, now where did I put it?"
00:20:26.041,00:20:31.125,"Ah, if only I paid more attention to my dinner, I'd be eating my dessert about now."
00:20:31.166,00:20:32.500,- Maury?
00:20:32.541,00:20:35.250,What're you doing up so late?
00:20:35.291,00:20:40.291,"Bubbles, the question isn't what am I doing up so late, but what are you doing up so late?"
00:20:40.333,00:20:44.208,Bubbles has decided to become nocturnal.
00:20:44.250,00:20:47.333,"Uh, Bubbles?"
00:20:47.375,00:20:48.791,Huh?
00:20:48.833,00:20:50.416,"Yeah, I'm up, I'm up."
00:20:50.458,00:20:53.250,Wow.
00:20:53.291,00:20:58.458,Dolphin Canyon is so beautiful at night.
00:20:59.750,00:21:05.583,A nighttime finball is definitely in my future.
00:21:08.291,00:21:10.041,Uh...
00:21:10.083,00:21:15.083,"yeah, well, I guess some of us are nocturnal and others, um, not so much."
00:21:15.125,00:21:20.875,I think it's time to get our diurnal dragonet back to Pebble Place.
00:21:20.916,00:21:22.375,"I'll see you later, Maury."
00:21:22.416,00:21:25.041,"Hey, maybe join you for a late-night snack?"
00:21:25.083,00:21:26.541,"Oh, sure."
00:21:26.583,00:21:28.541,"If I, uh, can find it."
00:21:28.583,00:21:31.416,Bye.
00:21:31.458,00:21:38.875,"Gee, Bubbles, I don't know about you, but for a nocturnal fish, I'm completely exhausted."
00:21:38.916,00:21:42.416,"Ah, can't take it, huh?"
00:21:42.458,00:21:44.041,Come on.
00:21:44.083,00:21:45.916,"Yeah, well..."
00:21:45.958,00:21:48.875,"Yeah, us nocturnal fish have a..."
00:21:48.916,00:21:50.500,I'm a nocturnal fish.
00:21:50.541,00:21:54.958,You're a nocturnal fish tonight.
00:21:55.000,00:21:56.791,"Hey there, nocturnal fish."
00:21:56.833,00:21:58.375,- Rise and shine.
00:21:58.416,00:22:00.625,How was your nocturnal adventure?
00:22:00.666,00:22:05.500,"Turns out being a nocturnal fish isn't something you can just, uh, choose."
00:22:05.541,00:22:07.958,- Really?
00:22:08.000,00:22:13.833,"Well, you see, all the things that nocturnal fish do at night, we diurnal fish do during the day."
00:22:13.875,00:22:16.625,"You mean like, eat, play, and swim?"
00:22:16.666,00:22:19.375,Yeah.
00:22:16.666,00:22:26.500,"They have these special sensors that help them to see in the dark, smell for food, and swim around the reef - without bumping into things."
00:22:26.541,00:22:28.625,Reeftown at night sounds fascinating.
00:22:28.666,00:22:30.166,- Yeah.
00:22:31.416,00:22:32.833,- Yeah.
00:22:32.875,00:22:34.791,"Hey, you know what?"
00:22:34.833,00:22:36.458,Come with me.
00:22:36.500,00:22:38.041,"- Yeah, let's go see Zee."
00:22:38.083,00:22:40.583,- Come on!
00:22:38.083,00:22:44.083,"- Zee, I just came to-- Well, how do you like that?"
00:22:44.125,00:22:49.666,I guess even nocturnal creatures need to catch their Zs sometime.
00:22:51.458,00:22:54.041,"Aw, we should let her sleep."
00:22:54.083,00:22:56.375,- Yeah.
00:22:56.416,00:22:57.541,- Sweet dreams.
00:01:01.958,00:01:04.000,- Seaweed!
00:01:05.041,00:01:07.041,Aww. Seaweed!
00:01:07.083,00:01:08.583,Coral!
00:01:08.625,00:01:10.000,Whoo!
00:01:10.041,00:01:13.041,Aww.
00:01:13.083,00:01:14.041,Coral!
00:01:16.000,00:01:19.083,Ah. Seaweed!
00:01:21.833,00:01:23.000,Come find us!
00:01:23.041,00:01:25.916,I know you guys are here somewhere!
00:01:25.958,00:01:27.833,Kelp blade!
00:01:29.791,00:01:31.583,"Ooh, kelp blade!"
00:01:34.708,00:01:35.875,Kelp blade!
00:01:36.916,00:01:39.083,"Ooh, ah."
00:01:39.125,00:01:40.916,Seaweed!
00:01:42.833,00:01:44.583,Seaweed!
00:01:45.833,00:01:48.166,- Huh?
00:01:48.208,00:01:50.000,Did one of you guys say kelp blade?
00:01:50.041,00:01:52.583,- Nope. I said coral.
00:01:52.625,00:01:55.625,There is no kelp blade in seaweed-coral.
00:01:55.666,00:01:57.416,"Yeah, that's strange."
00:01:57.458,00:02:02.000,The only fish I know who play kelp blade and shell - are Jerome...
00:02:02.041,00:02:04.125,"- Yeah, mm-hmm."
00:02:02.041,00:02:06.333,- But how would we hear 'em here in our clubhouse?
00:02:06.375,00:02:09.458,Because Jerome and his school are here!
00:02:09.500,00:02:11.666,"Uh, Jerome!"
00:02:11.708,00:02:13.208,And his school.
00:02:13.250,00:02:18.875,"Uh, yeah, what a surprise A wonderful surprise, I hope."
00:02:18.916,00:02:20.041,"Uh, of course."
00:02:20.083,00:02:22.375,Wonderful.
00:02:22.416,00:02:27.791,"been here so many times before, and, uh, well, we've never seen you."
00:02:27.833,00:02:30.541,- And the same with us.
00:02:30.583,00:02:33.041,"Well, uh, welcome to our clubhouse."
00:02:33.083,00:02:35.500,"Yes, welcome to our clubhouse."
00:02:35.541,00:02:38.875,Yeah.
00:02:38.916,00:02:40.666,Uh... hmm.
00:02:44.416,00:02:47.958,"Well, uh, it's fine if you want to play here, of course."
00:02:48.000,00:02:50.958,"- Uh, for the day, that is."
00:02:51.000,00:02:54.166,"And, uh, you too."
00:02:54.208,00:02:56.416,For the day.
00:02:56.458,00:02:57.750,Fine.
00:02:57.791,00:02:59.375,"Yes, fine."
00:02:59.416,00:03:01.708,"Okay, uh, we'll play over here."
00:03:01.750,00:03:03.583,- Yeah.
00:03:05.625,00:03:07.875,- Here we go.
00:03:07.916,00:03:09.583,And we'll just stay over here.
00:03:09.625,00:03:11.875,"Um, I'll just back out, and we'll be having fun."
00:03:11.916,00:03:13.750,Yes.
00:03:15.666,00:03:17.291,Seaweed!
00:03:17.333,00:03:18.333,- Coral!
00:03:18.375,00:03:20.041,- Kelp blade!
00:03:22.166,00:03:24.208,Aha! Gotcha!
00:03:24.250,00:03:27.500,"Oh, sorry."
00:03:27.541,00:03:29.500,- Huh.
00:03:29.541,00:03:30.916,- Huh?
00:03:30.958,00:03:33.708,I just tagged Bubbles by mistake.
00:03:33.750,00:03:37.541,"Uh, yeah, maybe we shouldn't play so close together."
00:03:37.583,00:03:39.458,My thoughts exactly.
00:03:39.500,00:03:42.541,Let's discuss.
00:03:42.583,00:03:46.333,"So it, uh-- it definitely feels crowded in here."
00:03:46.375,00:03:49.916,- Definitely.
00:03:49.958,00:03:52.375,"Well, I, uh-- I have a suggestion."
00:03:52.416,00:03:56.416,can find your own clubhouse.
00:03:56.458,00:03:58.375,- Superb thought.
00:03:58.416,00:04:00.666,- And so we did.
00:04:00.708,00:04:02.666,You're in it.
00:04:02.708,00:04:04.750,Right now? Oh.
00:04:04.791,00:04:06.458,- You mean this one.
00:04:06.500,00:04:10.916,"Uh, well, uh, Jerome, it-- it can't be both of our clubhouses, can it?"
00:04:10.958,00:04:12.333,Right again!
00:04:12.375,00:04:14.416,"Wow, it's very good of you to let us have it."
00:04:14.458,00:04:16.541,"Yeah. Wait, what?"
00:04:16.583,00:04:19.916,"Wait, I-I didn't say anything about having-- Hey, hey, hey, Splash?"
00:04:19.958,00:04:22.541,"Um, can we talk to you?"
00:04:22.583,00:04:23.833,- Huh?
00:04:27.458,00:04:36.750,"Um, Splash, you know, we all like playing here, but, well, it's really not our clubhouse, now, is it?"
00:04:36.791,00:04:38.041,What? Of course it is.
00:04:38.083,00:04:40.125,We-- we play in it all the time.
00:04:40.166,00:04:43.208,"- Yes, but so do they."
00:04:43.250,00:04:46.041,They like this clubhouse as much as we do.
00:04:46.083,00:04:48.416,- Then there's only one answer.
00:04:48.458,00:04:49.583,- They need to leave.
00:04:49.625,00:04:51.916,- Whoa! Are you sure?
00:04:51.958,00:04:54.625,"That-- that doesn't sound like you, Splash."
00:04:54.666,00:04:57.375,When do you ever tell friends they can't play?
00:04:57.416,00:05:00.041,"Well, I don't think I ever have."
00:05:00.083,00:05:01.458,"Well, right."
00:05:01.500,00:05:03.708,"Well, there's a first time for everything."
00:05:03.750,00:05:05.625,I just feel different about this clubhouse.
00:05:05.666,00:05:08.208,I-- I don't want to share.
00:05:08.250,00:05:10.708,But what if they don't want to leave?
00:05:16.291,00:05:18.875,Nope.
00:05:18.916,00:05:20.250,They need to leave.
00:05:20.291,00:05:22.791,they won't leave?
00:05:26.583,00:05:31.583,"Well, if we can't share, we'll have to divide the clubhouse."
00:05:31.625,00:05:33.166,Gotcha.
00:05:33.208,00:05:36.166,Now this is a fair solution.
00:05:36.208,00:05:40.041,"You all stay on your side of the line, and we stay on ours."
00:05:40.083,00:05:42.666,- No problem.
00:05:44.625,00:05:47.125,"Uh, okay, problem!"
00:05:47.166,00:05:48.875,I'm okay with that!
00:05:48.916,00:05:50.625,"Uh, let's try something else."
00:05:50.666,00:05:53.208,"Um, what if we each pretend the other one isn't here?"
00:05:53.250,00:05:54.916,Fine by me.
00:05:54.958,00:05:56.500,What?
00:05:56.541,00:05:58.500,"Ah, it's working already."
00:05:58.541,00:06:02.000,"Boy, oh, boy, it's almost like I'm all alone."
00:06:02.041,00:06:05.791,"- I hear another voice, but that can't be possible, 'cause I'm all alone."
00:06:11.916,00:06:14.875,"Uh, excuse me, I need to get by, please."
00:06:14.916,00:06:16.500,Who said that?
00:06:16.541,00:06:18.458,I need to get by.
00:06:18.500,00:06:21.125,"I hear a voice, but there's no one there."
00:06:21.166,00:06:23.583,I am ignoring the someone.
00:06:23.625,00:06:26.708,"Let me by, please, Jerome."
00:06:26.750,00:06:29.000,This could go on all day.
00:06:29.041,00:06:32.083,Seems like it already has.
00:06:32.125,00:06:34.916,Splash just isn't acting like himself.
00:06:34.958,00:06:36.125,That's for sure.
00:06:36.166,00:06:39.666,"We see the problem, but we don't know how to fix it."
00:06:39.708,00:06:42.083,"Well, I think we have to try."
00:06:42.125,00:06:44.625,I know just who to talk to.
00:06:44.666,00:06:46.500,I'll be right back.
00:06:50.000,00:06:51.375,- Flo!
00:06:51.416,00:06:53.416,- Just the one I'm looking for.
00:06:55.291,00:06:57.750,"Well, always nice to hear."
00:06:57.791,00:07:01.250,I was just coming to visit my Reeftown friends.
00:07:01.291,00:07:04.500,"Oh, I heard you were in the clubhouse today."
00:07:04.541,00:07:06.083,That Maury sure likes to talk.
00:07:06.125,00:07:08.916,"Well, I'm glad you're here."
00:07:08.958,00:07:14.791,"Splash and Jerome both want the clubhouse, - and they won't share."
00:07:14.833,00:07:18.500,"Sounds like they're acting, um, territorial."
00:07:18.541,00:07:20.541,What's territorial?
00:07:20.583,00:07:27.375,"Well, it's when someone wants something all to themselves, and they don't want to share."
00:07:27.416,00:07:30.041,Yes!
00:07:30.083,00:07:39.125,"Now let's go teach Splash and Jerome that we all live in one big ocean, and we all need to share."
00:08:57.708,00:08:59.416,I love this place.
00:09:02.000,00:09:04.791,Stop that.
00:09:06.833,00:09:10.000,"Congratulations, Splash and Jerome."
00:09:10.041,00:09:14.750,- Huh? What-- - For--for what?
00:09:14.791,00:09:17.916,"You see, it's not your fault you can't share."
00:09:17.958,00:09:20.500,- It's instinct.
00:09:20.541,00:09:22.708,I don't smell anything.
00:09:22.750,00:09:28.291,Following your instinct is when each of you feel you can't share the clubhouse.
00:09:28.333,00:09:32.833,Instinct tells you to protect your own territory.
00:09:32.875,00:09:34.250,And that's good?
00:09:34.291,00:09:43.916,"Well, instincts can be a wonderful thing when they keep you out of danger, or they help you protect yourself or your friends or your family."
00:09:43.958,00:09:45.916,"Yeah, I-- I guess."
00:09:45.958,00:09:51.916,But when it tells you to be territorial and keep your friend away from your clubhouse?
00:09:51.958,00:09:56.875,"Hmm, well, you might want to give instinct another think."
00:09:56.916,00:10:00.916,But what should we do now?
00:10:00.958,00:10:03.666,"Well, if you can't share..."
00:10:03.708,00:10:05.333,Yes?
00:10:05.375,00:10:07.041,Then you shouldn't try.
00:10:07.083,00:10:09.791,What?
00:10:09.833,00:10:13.208,"- Wow, you're just-- you're full of surprises today, Flo."
00:10:13.250,00:10:17.750,"Uh, yeah, I thought we were teaching them all about sharing?"
00:10:17.791,00:10:21.333,"Well, some lessons have to be learned the hard way."
00:10:21.375,00:10:24.333,Ah.
00:10:24.375,00:10:25.958,You will.
00:10:26.000,00:10:28.916,You two just guard each other.
00:10:28.958,00:10:31.041,"The rest of you, go play."
00:10:31.083,00:10:32.875,- Whoo-hoo!
00:10:32.916,00:10:34.791,- Whee!
00:10:34.833,00:10:39.875,"But-- but, Flo, how will they learn to play together if they're not sharing?"
00:10:39.916,00:10:43.291,"Oh, instinct will take care of that."
00:10:43.333,00:10:49.541,These two have one instinct more powerful than being territorial.
00:11:01.375,00:11:04.916,"Sure does, uh, sound like they're having fun over there, huh?"
00:11:04.958,00:11:06.250,Yeah.
00:11:06.291,00:11:09.000,"But, uh, well, this is more important."
00:11:09.041,00:11:11.000,- Right.
00:11:11.041,00:11:15.625,"Way more important than, uh-- than, uh, what they're, uh..."
00:11:15.666,00:11:19.541,They're playing follow-the-leader now.
00:11:19.583,00:11:21.125,- My favorite!
00:11:22.875,00:11:24.958,- Oh.
00:11:25.000,00:11:26.583,"You know what, Jerome?"
00:11:26.625,00:11:29.541,I think I just realized what Flo was trying to teach us.
00:11:29.583,00:11:30.875,What's that?
00:11:30.916,00:11:35.541,"Well, we have one instinct that's more powerful than guarding the clubhouse."
00:11:35.583,00:11:37.541,Really?
00:11:37.583,00:11:40.125,Having fun with our friends.
00:11:40.166,00:11:42.791,Oh.
00:11:42.833,00:11:44.541,- Huh?
00:11:44.583,00:11:46.958,"- Well, you know what, Jerome?"
00:11:47.000,00:11:49.166,- You're it!
00:11:49.208,00:11:50.750,- You're the leader!
00:11:50.791,00:11:53.708,"- Yeah, wait for me!"
00:11:53.750,00:11:56.041,Jerome is the leader!
00:12:02.291,00:12:05.333,Whoo-ha!
00:12:05.375,00:12:07.333,Whoa!
00:12:07.375,00:12:09.416,- Whoa!
00:12:09.458,00:12:12.666,- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
00:12:12.708,00:12:15.625,- That was amazing!
00:12:15.666,00:12:19.416,I call it my Triple Tang Boomerang.
00:12:19.458,00:12:21.750,"- Ooh, Triple Tang Boomerang."
00:12:21.791,00:12:23.541,Ha!
00:12:23.583,00:12:26.875,Triple Tang Boomerang.
00:12:26.916,00:12:29.666,Triple Tang Boomerang.
00:12:29.708,00:12:32.958,Thank you so much.
00:12:33.000,00:12:35.000,But what should we do next?
00:12:35.041,00:12:38.166,No way!
00:12:38.208,00:12:41.416,You guys haven't seen my Daredevil Dunk Dive.
00:12:41.458,00:12:44.833,"Yeah, these coral slides are so much fun."
00:12:44.875,00:12:48.125,"Well, everything is fun when you're hanging with your friends."
00:12:48.166,00:12:51.458,"You said it, Splash."
00:13:06.125,00:13:09.666,I'm going global.
00:13:09.708,00:13:13.166,"Bubbles, that's me!"
00:13:13.208,00:13:15.166,Do I like stuff that's gross and gooey?
00:13:15.208,00:13:16.833,You bet!
00:13:24.000,00:13:27.583,I'm the artist known as Dunk.
00:13:31.791,00:13:33.208,"Ripple, I'm a seahorse."
00:13:58.041,00:14:02.291,Here comes the famous - Daredevil Dunk Dive!
00:14:02.333,00:14:04.041,You may want to back up a little.
00:14:04.083,00:14:05.666,"- Ohh, yes, sir."
00:14:05.708,00:14:07.916,Whoo!
00:14:07.958,00:14:09.666,I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
00:14:09.708,00:14:12.375,Yeah!
00:14:12.416,00:14:13.625,Whoa! Whoa!
00:14:13.666,00:14:15.708,Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
00:14:15.750,00:14:17.000,Ta-da!
00:14:17.041,00:14:19.625,Two and a half turns.
00:14:19.666,00:14:21.000,Uh...
00:14:21.041,00:14:22.583,- What's wrong?
00:14:22.625,00:14:26.708,it seemed like you were under by one half turn.
00:14:26.750,00:14:28.291,- Yeah.
00:14:28.333,00:14:31.083,That was definitely two full turns and a half.
00:14:31.125,00:14:33.791,- Uh...
00:14:33.833,00:14:36.666,Sure I'm sure!
00:14:36.708,00:14:38.875,It was two and a half!
00:14:38.916,00:14:40.958,"Can I go now, please?"
00:14:41.000,00:14:43.166,"Well, there was that one time I flipped backwards."
00:14:43.208,00:14:45.541,"No, we don't recall that either."
00:14:43.208,00:14:50.458,We usually recall-- I hope you guys are ready for the Splash-tastic Somersault!
00:14:50.500,00:14:52.041,Whoo-hoo!
00:14:54.500,00:14:55.666,Whoa!
00:14:55.708,00:14:57.791,Whoo!
00:15:00.250,00:15:04.125,"Yeah, oh-- uh... Ripple?"
00:15:04.166,00:15:06.833,- Is that you?
00:15:06.875,00:15:11.291,"Uh, okay, Bubbles, I wasn't ready for hide and seek."
00:15:11.333,00:15:13.458,- Wha-- huh?
00:15:13.500,00:15:17.916,What is that?
00:15:17.958,00:15:21.791,"To settle this once and for all, - we should do it again."
00:15:21.833,00:15:25.458,"I was just about to suggest that, Dunk."
00:15:25.500,00:15:28.083,"Heya, Splash, where were you?"
00:15:28.125,00:15:30.833,You missed Dunk's big slide.
00:15:30.875,00:15:33.750,"Okay, not funny, guys, who is there?!"
00:15:33.791,00:15:36.500,- And who are you talking to?
00:15:36.541,00:15:42.041,"Oh, well, I thought I heard you guys, but-- wait, you were over there?"
00:15:42.083,00:15:46.750,"Yep, and you seriously just missed the best Daredevil Dunk Dive ever."
00:15:46.791,00:15:50.625,"So, who was I talking to?"
00:15:50.666,00:15:53.625,"Well, there was some sort of mysterious creature back there."
00:15:53.666,00:15:57.166,- I-I'm sure of it.
00:15:53.666,00:16:00.666,"- So, um, what did this mysterious creature sound like?"
00:16:00.708,00:16:03.958,It sounded almost...
00:16:04.000,00:16:06.791,Huh?
00:16:06.833,00:16:10.208,Kind of.
00:16:10.250,00:16:12.041,but I definitely heard something.
00:16:12.083,00:16:15.000,- And you didn't see them?
00:16:15.041,00:16:17.666,I didn't see anyone else in Dorsal Park.
00:16:17.708,00:16:19.125,So-- whoa.
00:16:19.166,00:16:21.541,Maybe they're somewhere else on the reef now.
00:16:21.583,00:16:24.625,"Ooh, this sounds like a big mystery."
00:16:24.666,00:16:30.625,We're gonna have to go all over Reeftown to see if we can find out who was making those sounds.
00:16:30.666,00:16:33.333,- Yeah!
00:16:34.666,00:16:37.250,"You heard strange sounds, huh?"
00:16:37.291,00:16:38.875,Can you tell us what it sounded like?
00:16:38.916,00:16:43.083,"Yeah, we were wondering if it sounded like when you snap your claws, Snap."
00:16:43.125,00:16:45.458,"Ah, I see."
00:16:43.125,00:16:48.000,"Well, the only way I do that is when Scout says the special word."
00:16:48.041,00:16:49.458,"Uh, what does that mean?"
00:16:49.500,00:16:53.666,He only snaps his claws when I say now.
00:16:53.708,00:16:55.208,Now?
00:16:57.625,00:16:59.791,"Was that the sound, Splash?"
00:16:59.833,00:17:01.958,"Uh, definitely not."
00:17:02.000,00:17:03.833,I'd remember if it was like that.
00:17:03.875,00:17:05.916,"After hearing that, I'm dizzy now."
00:17:05.958,00:17:07.416,- Now? Who said now?!
00:17:09.041,00:17:11.000,"Um, right, well, uh, thanks, guys!"
00:17:11.041,00:17:12.625,You're welcome.
00:17:12.666,00:17:15.375,I wish we could've been more helpful. Bye now.
00:17:18.083,00:17:21.000,It could've been me.
00:17:21.041,00:17:23.375,Like this.
00:17:23.416,00:17:26.333,Mmm. Just slurped up a yummy parasite.
00:17:26.375,00:17:29.750,- Nice!
00:17:29.791,00:17:32.583,"Right, or it could've been Maury."
00:17:32.625,00:17:34.166,He does have a golden voice.
00:17:35.750,00:17:37.791,"Don't be so modest, Maury."
00:17:37.833,00:17:39.791,You are a fabulous singer.
00:17:42.750,00:17:44.791,"Oh! Was that the sound, Splash?"
00:17:44.833,00:17:47.833,Uh... no.
00:17:47.875,00:17:49.250,- Thanks.
00:17:49.291,00:17:51.250,Thank you.
00:17:51.291,00:17:55.583,I don't know if we'll ever find out - who the noisemaker was.
00:17:55.625,00:17:57.708,We'll figure out who's making those sounds.
00:17:57.750,00:18:00.541,Maybe we should go back to where you first heard the sound.
00:18:00.583,00:18:02.583,I bet we'll find somebody to help.
00:18:02.625,00:18:05.083,"What a great idea, Dunk!"
00:18:05.125,00:18:07.291,- To Dorsal Park!
00:18:08.833,00:18:12.000,"Let's take this from the beginning, shall we?"
00:18:12.041,00:18:18.875,"So, Splash, you heard the musical mystery sounds here near the slides, yes?"
00:18:18.916,00:18:26.458,"Right, well, first I was trying not to hit you guys at the bottom, and then I landed in the coral, like this..."
00:18:26.500,00:18:29.541,- Look out below!
00:18:29.583,00:18:34.791,"Then when I was getting up, I heard-- I heard something like music!"
00:18:37.250,00:18:40.625,I know that sound!
00:18:40.666,00:18:43.541,Wha-- that's the coral?
00:18:43.583,00:18:46.500,"Oh, well, it's beautiful and amazing."
00:18:46.541,00:18:48.250,It sure is.
00:18:48.291,00:18:50.208,"Even better, it's all over the reef."
00:18:50.250,00:18:52.416,"- Come on, we'll show you."
00:18:52.458,00:18:54.041,- Okay.
00:18:54.083,00:18:56.958,Right here.
00:18:57.000,00:18:59.166,"Uh, okay."
00:18:59.208,00:19:01.875,"- Now, let's see. Uh..."
00:19:01.916,00:19:04.458,I hear it!
00:19:04.500,00:19:06.791,Wow!
00:19:06.833,00:19:10.000,"Splash, that's not a rock."
00:19:10.041,00:19:13.583,- What?
00:19:13.625,00:19:16.458,It's an animal like you and me.
00:19:16.500,00:19:18.500,- What?
00:19:16.500,00:19:22.208,"- Yeah, everything on the reef here is alive and can make sounds when you brush up against it."
00:19:22.250,00:19:27.416,And some things make really loud sounds and some things make really quiet ones.
00:19:27.458,00:19:32.083,"But if you listen real close, you can hear the whole reef."
00:19:32.125,00:19:35.291,"- Wow. Hey, yeah!"
00:19:35.333,00:19:37.625,"Well, let's go try out some more things!"
00:19:40.375,00:19:46.791,"Ah, so you're telling me that this coral is a living animal just like-- like you and me?"
00:19:46.833,00:19:49.583,- Yup.
00:19:52.666,00:19:54.916,Amazing!
00:19:54.958,00:19:56.958,"Well, how about this one?"
00:19:59.041,00:20:01.416,- Whoa!
00:20:01.458,00:20:05.875,- Yep!
00:20:05.916,00:20:08.166,"No, that's just a rock."
00:20:08.208,00:20:11.916,I can't believe I never heard the sound of the coral until now.
00:20:11.958,00:20:15.625,Maybe you just needed to come somewhere quieter to hear the sounds.
00:20:23.750,00:20:25.375,"Oh! Hey, um..."
00:20:25.416,00:20:29.500,Hello. Are you what I was talking to earlier?
00:20:29.541,00:20:31.625,"- Ooh, sorry."
00:20:31.666,00:20:35.208,Are you who I was talking to earlier?
00:20:37.708,00:20:39.250,"Wow, you guys!"
00:20:39.291,00:20:42.875,I can hear all the coral!
00:20:42.916,00:20:45.916,"Splash, there's more."
00:20:45.958,00:20:48.166,"Just look closely, and you'll see them."
00:20:48.208,00:20:49.416,Wow.
00:20:49.458,00:20:55.541,Each piece of coral you see is actually made up of a lot of different coral polyps.
00:20:55.583,00:21:01.750,Sometimes there are hundreds or even thousands of polyps on one piece of coral.
00:21:01.791,00:21:07.458,"And to think, all this time I thought these coral were just rocks and plants."
00:21:07.500,00:21:12.000,But I'd never heard any rocks make music like that.
00:21:15.083,00:21:19.041,"Well, if you like that, you haven't heard anything yet."
00:21:19.083,00:21:21.291,Really?
00:21:21.333,00:21:25.000,The coral aren't the only creatures in Reeftown with music in them.
00:21:25.041,00:21:26.500,It's in all of us.
00:21:26.541,00:21:32.833,"Now that you know how to listen for it, soon you'll discover there's music and rhythm all around us."
00:21:32.875,00:21:38.500,I think it's about time to show you how we put all that beautiful rhythm together.
00:21:38.541,00:21:39.708,What do you say?
00:21:39.750,00:21:42.750,"I say, let's do it!"
00:21:45.500,00:21:49.041,- Here we go!
00:22:14.791,00:22:16.958,- Ooh!
00:22:17.000,00:22:19.750,- It's a funky reef.
00:22:19.791,00:22:21.708,Dig this motif.
00:22:21.750,00:22:24.833,"Oh, move over, everybody."
00:22:24.875,00:22:27.875,This is what I like to call the shrimp shuffle.
00:22:29.666,00:22:31.541,"- Oh, dancing is the best."
00:22:31.583,00:22:34.833,"- Sing it, girls."
00:22:57.416,00:22:59.416,- Yeah!
00:01:03.125,00:01:05.000,"Oh, boy!"
00:01:05.041,00:01:07.916,I can't wait to get to those coral slides.
00:01:07.958,00:01:10.458,Me either!
00:01:10.500,00:01:15.583,"Yeah, is it just me or is it taking longer than usual to get there?"
00:01:15.625,00:01:21.416,"Yeah, the current does seem stronger than usual today."
00:01:23.583,00:01:25.750,"You know, Dunk, you may be right."
00:01:28.291,00:01:31.333,What was that?!
00:01:33.375,00:01:35.250,Who's making that noise?
00:01:35.291,00:01:37.125,"Hey, I think we need to get back to Reeftown."
00:01:38.791,00:01:41.416,Someone keeps making a noise and then swimming away.
00:01:41.458,00:01:46.833,"It's not someone, Dunk-- between the thunder and the currents getting stronger, that can only mean one thing."
00:01:46.875,00:01:49.250,- Dinnertime!
00:01:49.291,00:01:51.000,- Huh?
00:01:51.041,00:01:55.916,"You know, about the storm coming to Reeftown, but also-- also dinnertime!"
00:01:55.958,00:01:57.291,Ugh.
00:01:57.333,00:01:59.041,We have to go warn Mayor Sting.
00:01:59.083,00:02:00.750,"- Oh, yeah."
00:02:00.791,00:02:04.083,"- Bubbles, can you just-- - Don't worry, I got you."
00:02:04.125,00:02:07.291,"Citizens of Reeftown, I have an announcement to make."
00:02:07.333,00:02:09.916,- A big announcement.
00:02:09.958,00:02:15.625,"A storm will be hitting Reeftown later today, but I'm here to remind you not to worry."
00:02:15.666,00:02:17.708,Reeftown is ready for this.
00:02:17.750,00:02:20.458,We've been through bad weather and storms before.
00:02:20.500,00:02:24.833,"As you know, it's always a good idea to be Reef Ready."
00:02:24.875,00:02:28.041,Always remember to be aware and be prepared.
00:02:38.916,00:02:40.458,"- Ah, thanks, Mayor Sting."
00:02:40.500,00:02:41.750,- Bye!
00:02:41.791,00:02:44.083,How bad could this storm really be?
00:02:44.125,00:02:49.125,"We'll be okay, since there are lots of places to take shelter in Reeftown."
00:02:49.166,00:02:50.708,Maybe we should double-check our homes.
00:02:50.750,00:02:53.458,Are you ready to get Reef Ready?
00:02:53.500,00:02:55.125,- Yeah!
00:02:55.166,00:02:57.791,"- All right, let's do it."
00:02:57.833,00:03:00.625,"All right, well, looking Reef Ready to me."
00:03:00.666,00:03:02.875,Check.
00:03:02.916,00:03:07.125,I'm glad you checked your homes because storms are no laughing matter.
00:03:07.166,00:03:15.583,"You need to have a good, strong shelter, and you also need to have something to hold on to to anchor yourself for when the current gets stronger."
00:03:15.625,00:03:18.916,- Like this?
00:03:18.958,00:03:21.708,"Oh, no, that's good, strong holding on there, Ripple."
00:03:21.750,00:03:27.708,You need that because you never know when you might get hit by a rock or a shell that's been picked up during the storm.
00:03:27.750,00:03:29.541,I'm sure everything will be fine.
00:03:29.583,00:03:35.500,"It's just, you know, be aware and prepared and-- something, uh..."
00:03:35.541,00:03:37.291,"Well, you know the rest."
00:03:37.333,00:03:40.083,"- You okay, Gush?"
00:03:40.125,00:03:42.250,Don't worry about old Gush here.
00:03:42.291,00:03:46.666,"I've been in a bunch of storms and, uh, I still don't like 'em."
00:03:46.708,00:03:48.583,- Yeesh.
00:03:48.625,00:03:53.333,"Well, I think our homes are gonna work great - as shelters during the storm."
00:03:53.375,00:03:56.125,"Uh, they will, won't they?"
00:03:56.166,00:03:58.041,"Oh, I'm sure we're fine."
00:03:58.083,00:04:00.958,"Hey, Gush, what do you think about, uh..."
00:04:01.000,00:04:03.208,"Whoa, maybe he headed back home to Coral Cove."
00:04:03.250,00:04:05.250,"- Let's go see, come on."
00:04:05.291,00:04:08.208,- Gush! Gush!
00:04:08.250,00:04:11.250,"Ooh, Gush, have you heard?"
00:04:11.291,00:04:13.500,There's a storm coming to Reeftown.
00:04:13.541,00:04:21.166,"Ha, everyone's getting Reef Ready, but, ha, a storm's no big deal for a couple of old Reeftowners like us, huh?"
00:04:21.208,00:04:24.791,"- Ugh, can you keep a secret?"
00:04:24.833,00:04:26.250,I might have guessed that.
00:04:26.291,00:04:29.208,"Ugh, but still, I just have to tell someone."
00:04:29.250,00:04:33.833,"Maury, I've very afraid of storms."
00:04:33.875,00:04:35.541,What? You?
00:04:35.583,00:04:37.458,Come on!
00:04:37.500,00:04:40.666,"Yes, but please, don't tell anyone."
00:04:40.708,00:04:45.291,"Okay, uh, even though I really want to tell everyone."
00:04:45.333,00:04:46.416,"For you, I promise."
00:04:46.458,00:04:49.291,"Oh, hey, Maury."
00:04:49.333,00:04:52.083,"Oh, hi, I have nothing to tell you."
00:04:52.125,00:04:53.333,"So, uh, bye!"
00:04:53.375,00:04:56.708,"- Uh, sheesh."
00:04:56.750,00:04:59.125,This storm sure is making everyone act funny.
00:04:59.166,00:05:02.791,"Speaking of the storm, Gush, can we ask you some more questions?"
00:05:02.833,00:05:06.916,"You know, because you're so smart, and you've experienced so many storms."
00:05:06.958,00:05:09.958,"Yeah, well, I certainly have endured a lot of storms."
00:05:10.000,00:05:11.541,That's true.
00:05:11.583,00:05:14.958,So how do you get through a storm so bravely?
00:05:15.000,00:05:17.125,What's your secret?
00:05:17.166,00:05:18.833,Secret?
00:05:18.875,00:05:22.041,"You mean a secret, like I'm afraid of storms?"
00:05:22.083,00:05:24.791,Me afraid of storms?
00:05:28.041,00:05:29.708,"Oh, good one!"
00:05:29.750,00:05:32.041,"Yeah, but we just need to be Reef Ready, right, everyone?"
00:05:32.083,00:05:37.166,"Yeah, 'cause what if a storm comes and somebody's not Reef Ready?"
00:05:37.208,00:05:40.958,"What if, uh, a storm comes and someone needs to be rescued?"
00:05:41.000,00:05:43.708,"Gush, could that happen?"
00:05:43.750,00:05:46.791,Have you ever been involved in a rescue?
00:05:46.833,00:05:52.041,"Well, I may have been involved in one or two rescues."
00:05:52.083,00:05:53.708,"Well, don't worry, Gush."
00:05:53.750,00:05:59.416,"If you need help rescuing someone in this storm, the Reeftown Rangers will be there for you."
00:05:59.458,00:06:01.833,- Yeah!
00:06:52.625,00:06:54.291,Come on!
00:07:21.291,00:07:24.958,Let's go!
00:07:36.458,00:07:42.958,Now I feel so much better about facing this storm with my fellow Reeftown Rangers.
00:07:45.833,00:07:47.750,"Uh-oh, I think the storm is coming soon."
00:07:47.791,00:07:52.250,Let's do a quick patrol to make sure all Reeftown citizens are Reef Ready.
00:07:52.291,00:07:54.416,"Yeah, great idea, Splash."
00:07:54.458,00:07:57.083,"Come on, let's go, Reeftown Rangers."
00:07:57.125,00:08:00.208,- Let's go!
00:08:00.250,00:08:04.833,"Okay, you guys, one more big push, and we'll get this shell in place."
00:08:04.875,00:08:08.166,"Here we go, one, two, three!"
00:08:08.208,00:08:11.083,- Here we go.
00:08:11.125,00:08:13.500,"- You good, Maury?"
00:08:13.541,00:08:16.375,Reeftown Rangers!
00:08:16.416,00:08:19.541,- Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
00:08:21.833,00:08:24.125,"Yes, that's right."
00:08:24.166,00:08:27.416,You just wrap around tight and hold on.
00:08:27.458,00:08:30.458,"- Nice job, everyone."
00:08:30.500,00:08:33.791,We helped everyone in Reeftown get ready for the storm.
00:08:33.833,00:08:36.250,- Yeah.
00:08:36.291,00:08:38.833,"Whoa, I think the storm is here."
00:08:38.875,00:08:41.041,"Oh, boy, here we go."
00:08:41.083,00:08:44.708,"- Oh, are you okay, Gush?"
00:08:44.750,00:08:48.416,He's been through lots of storms before.
00:08:48.458,00:08:50.166,"Right, Gush?"
00:08:50.208,00:08:52.708,"By the way, where is Gush?"
00:08:52.750,00:08:55.000,- In here.
00:08:55.041,00:08:56.750,What are you doing in there?
00:08:56.791,00:09:00.416,How are you going to perform one of your daring rescues if you're in a cave?
00:09:00.458,00:09:05.416,"Ugh, actually, all I said was I've been involved in rescues."
00:09:05.458,00:09:08.875,I never said I was the one doing the rescuing.
00:09:08.916,00:09:10.333,What?
00:09:10.375,00:09:18.875,"Wait, but I thought that you knew everything-- All right, listen, it may be a little late to tell you all this, but, uh, I've always been nervous in storms."
00:09:18.916,00:09:20.791,"Scared, actually."
00:09:20.833,00:09:23.583,"Gush, it's okay to be nervous during storms."
00:09:23.625,00:09:27.791,"And besides, friends help each other out through tough times, right?"
00:09:27.833,00:09:30.416,"Yeah, ocean friends forever!"
00:09:30.458,00:09:31.791,We'll help each other.
00:09:31.833,00:09:34.166,- Whoa!
00:09:37.208,00:09:40.458,"You're right, that could've hit me right in the gills."
00:09:40.500,00:09:45.166,"Guys, we'd better head back to our shelters before this storm gets too bad."
00:09:47.750,00:09:50.458,I think it might be too late to head back to the shelters.
00:09:50.500,00:09:52.375,What are we gonna do?
00:09:52.416,00:09:54.125,Come wait out the storm in here with me.
00:09:54.166,00:09:55.916,There's plenty of room.
00:09:55.958,00:09:58.166,"- Okay, thanks, Gush."
00:09:58.208,00:10:00.583,In you go. That's right.
00:10:00.625,00:10:02.000,"- Come on, Ripple."
00:10:02.041,00:10:04.833,I'm okay.
00:10:07.666,00:10:10.291,"Uh, maybe not as good a grip as I thought."
00:10:10.333,00:10:11.708,"- Oh! Oh, no!"
00:10:11.750,00:10:13.916,- I'm coming for you!
00:10:13.958,00:10:20.458,"You won't be able to swim in these strong currents, but I can, using my special frogfish jet gills."
00:10:20.500,00:10:23.500,"Oh, but, Gush, are you okay to go out there?"
00:10:23.541,00:10:28.625,"- Not really, but Ripple is my friend, and she needs help."
00:10:28.666,00:10:32.041,"So if you'll excuse me, I have a friend to rescue."
00:10:32.083,00:10:34.250,"Uh-oh, ooh-ooh."
00:10:34.291,00:10:35.458,"Oh, no."
00:10:35.500,00:10:37.791,Ah!
00:10:37.833,00:10:40.708,"Thank you, Gush!"
00:10:40.750,00:10:43.500,"- I'm glad you're okay, Ripple."
00:10:46.458,00:10:48.375,"Thank you so much, Gush."
00:10:48.416,00:10:50.041,"Oh, you're welcome."
00:10:50.083,00:10:52.958,Now let's never do that again.
00:10:53.000,00:10:55.125,"Yeah, good idea."
00:10:57.291,00:10:58.958,"It's beautiful, huh?"
00:10:59.000,00:11:00.875,I'm glad we're safe in here.
00:11:08.500,00:11:09.791,- Whoa!
00:11:09.833,00:11:13.083,- The storm's passed.
00:11:13.125,00:11:14.625,- We did it!
00:11:14.666,00:11:17.333,"We really did, all together."
00:11:17.375,00:11:19.291,"Yeah, hey, Gush?"
00:11:19.333,00:11:22.875,I'm so proud of you for facing your fears during the storm.
00:11:22.916,00:11:25.208,"Yeah, you were so brave."
00:11:25.250,00:11:26.791,"Oh, thanks, kids."
00:11:26.833,00:11:30.666,"You know, you may have come to me for help, but it turned out to go the other way."
00:11:30.708,00:11:32.208,What do you mean?
00:11:32.250,00:11:36.041,I learned how to be brave during a storm by watching all of you.
00:11:36.083,00:11:45.416,"Yeah, I may have been through a lot of storms in my day, but I've never seen anyone as aware, prepared, Reef Ready, and brave as you kids."
00:11:45.458,00:11:47.541,Are you kidding?
00:11:47.583,00:11:50.791,"We're always aware, prepared, and ready."
00:11:50.833,00:11:52.708,For a group hug!
00:12:03.375,00:12:05.916,"Hmm, over here, is it-- no, not over there."
00:12:05.958,00:12:07.625,Maybe there's one there.
00:12:07.666,00:12:10.375,"Oh, boy, shell searching is hard today."
00:12:10.416,00:12:12.500,I haven't found anything all day.
00:12:12.541,00:12:16.208,"- Oh, I found a red shell!"
00:12:16.250,00:12:19.333,And... I got a rock.
00:12:19.375,00:12:23.708,"Which I love, so yay! Ha!"
00:12:23.750,00:12:25.375,"Oh, yeah?"
00:12:25.416,00:12:28.958,"Well, I found a really big shell right above us."
00:12:29.000,00:12:30.625,What?
00:12:33.000,00:12:35.875,Not when it's a turtle shell!
00:12:35.916,00:12:39.833,Oh! It must be Flo.
00:12:39.875,00:12:41.666,"- Hi, Flo!"
00:12:41.708,00:12:44.541,"I don't know, I think that turtle's too small to be Flo."
00:12:44.583,00:12:46.375,- Huh?
00:12:46.416,00:12:49.458,I think it just seems small because it's so far away.
00:12:49.500,00:12:51.000,Flo's not getting any bigger.
00:12:51.041,00:12:54.500,And now she's starting to look like Scoot.
00:12:54.541,00:12:57.166,"Hey, Dunk."
00:12:57.208,00:12:58.541,"- Hi, Scoot!"
00:12:58.583,00:13:00.500,"Of course we remember your name, Scoot."
00:13:00.541,00:13:02.833,It's not every day we travel around the world.
00:13:02.875,00:13:06.416,"For me, it is sort of every day, I guess not for most creatures."
00:13:06.458,00:13:09.250,I can't believe you finally made your way back to Reeftown.
00:13:09.291,00:13:10.875,What brings you here?
00:13:10.916,00:13:12.875,"Oh, the current brought me here."
00:13:12.916,00:13:16.708,I'm still in the first phase of my life where I just drift for years at a time.
00:13:16.750,00:13:19.500,"But, you know, it's a phase."
00:13:19.541,00:13:22.791,What I meant was what made you want to stop at Reeftown?
00:13:22.833,00:13:30.875,"Oh, well, I came here 'cause I was starting to get a little lonely traveling the currents all by myself, and-- So why don't you come hang out with us?"
00:13:30.916,00:13:34.833,"Oh, wow!"
00:13:34.875,00:13:36.708,- Uh?
00:13:36.750,00:13:38.458,"Oh, right."
00:13:38.500,00:13:40.791,He has to breathe above the surface.
00:13:40.833,00:13:43.791,- I forgot about that.
00:13:43.833,00:13:46.541,That sounds really great.
00:13:46.583,00:13:50.958,but I was thinking maybe we could play - outside of Reeftown.
00:13:51.000,00:13:53.083,"Okay, so where do you want to go?"
00:13:53.125,00:14:00.125,"- Well, like I said, I was getting kind of lonely traveling by myself, so I thought maybe you guys would want to go on an adventure with me."
00:14:00.166,00:14:02.375,- Good!
00:14:02.416,00:14:04.208,We can travel around the ocean!
00:14:04.250,00:14:06.708,- Together!
00:14:06.750,00:14:09.041,- Forever!
00:14:12.208,00:14:17.583,My papa doesn't even let me stay out past dinnertime without permission.
00:14:17.625,00:14:20.291,"Yeah, Scoot, Reeftown is our home."
00:14:20.333,00:14:23.166,We can't just leave it forever.
00:14:23.208,00:14:25.208,"Yeah, I understand."
00:14:25.250,00:14:28.416,I just wanted to go on an adventure.
00:14:28.458,00:14:32.250,But maybe we could go on an adventure right here.
00:14:37.333,00:14:41.250,"Oh, thanks, but having a place to call home has never been my thing."
00:14:41.291,00:14:45.250,I just wanted to take a break from drifting on the currents and see my friends for a bit.
00:14:45.291,00:14:51.333,"Well, there are lots of new friends here in Reeftown you can meet today if you want to."
00:14:51.375,00:14:53.458,Really?
00:14:53.500,00:14:55.833,"Like me, for one!"
00:14:55.875,00:14:58.750,"It's okay, it's just our friend, Maury."
00:14:58.791,00:15:00.916,"Hey, there, my little sea turtle friend."
00:15:00.958,00:15:02.875,"Hi, Maury."
00:15:02.916,00:15:05.583,My name is-- breath!
00:15:05.625,00:15:08.125,"Oh, well, uh, nice to meet you, Breath."
00:15:08.166,00:15:10.541,"Uh, ha, wh-- where'd he go?"
00:15:10.583,00:15:16.375,"Uh, actually, his name is Scoot, and, yeah, he does that from time to time."
00:15:16.416,00:15:18.333,He has to breathe air.
00:15:18.375,00:15:21.625,"Oh, what a hassle breathing air must be."
00:15:21.666,00:15:24.791,"Ha, gotta love those gills, am I right?"
00:15:24.833,00:15:28.708,"Say, are you an eel?"
00:15:28.750,00:15:32.083,- I've never met an eel before.
00:15:32.125,00:15:34.791,"I'm a snowflake moray eel, to be exact."
00:15:34.833,00:15:38.583,Wow.
00:15:38.625,00:15:40.375,"Yeah, you sure know your eels, buddy."
00:15:40.416,00:15:44.125,"Well, of course I do."
00:15:44.166,00:15:49.041,"Well, if you think I'm something, ha, you ain't seen nothing yet."
00:15:49.083,00:16:01.458,"In Reeftown, we have octopuses and crabs and shrimp and frogfish and sting rays and angelfish and damselfish and puff-- I think what Maury's trying to say is we have a lot of creatures."
00:16:01.500,00:16:04.000,"Oh, I'd love to meet them all while I'm here."
00:16:04.041,00:16:07.125,"Oh, but that would take forever to find all those fish."
00:16:07.166,00:16:10.458,"Oh, worry not, my little shell-tastic friend."
00:16:10.500,00:16:13.416,"Let Maury show you how it's done, ha!"
00:16:13.458,00:16:17.458,You don't have to go to them.
00:16:17.500,00:16:21.791,All I have to do is spread the word!
00:17:17.291,00:17:19.166,- Oh!
00:17:54.500,00:17:55.625,Have you heard?
00:17:55.666,00:17:58.750,There's a new friend in Reeftown.
00:17:58.791,00:18:00.916,"Hey, Scoot, nice to meet you."
00:18:00.958,00:18:02.166,"You too, Denny."
00:18:02.208,00:18:06.791,"Now if you'll excuse me, Scoot, I have my morning teeth-cleaning here with Denny."
00:18:06.833,00:18:10.000,"Now, Denny, I've got a live one in there, uh, literally."
00:18:10.041,00:18:12.500,That's what I'm here for.
00:18:12.541,00:18:13.791,"- Bye, Denny."
00:18:15.250,00:18:19.500,I can't believe how nice everyone is here.
00:18:19.541,00:18:20.916,"Well, of course they are."
00:18:20.958,00:18:24.541,"They're our friends and neighbors, and we all live right here on the reef."
00:18:24.583,00:18:26.375,- Huh?
00:18:26.416,00:18:28.000,Flo!
00:18:28.041,00:18:32.875,"You may not live right here on the reef, but you're as much a part of Reeftown as anyone, Flo."
00:18:32.916,00:18:38.625,"Flo, Flo, have you seen all the different creatures - that live here?"
00:18:38.666,00:18:42.083,"This is a pretty special place now, isn't it?"
00:18:42.125,00:18:43.500,I'll say.
00:18:43.541,00:18:49.583,"I've always enjoyed riding the currents, but now I can understand why you guys wouldn't want to leave this place."
00:18:49.625,00:18:52.083,It's so... so...
00:18:52.125,00:18:53.791,- Homey?
00:18:57.000,00:19:03.375,"Hey, Scoot, are you by any chance starting to get a little lonely out there on the currents?"
00:19:03.416,00:19:04.833,How'd you know?
00:19:04.875,00:19:08.166,"Well, because I went through the same thing when I was your age."
00:19:10.041,00:19:18.083,"Well, the first phase of a young sea turtle's life is called the pelagic phase, when you travel around the current."
00:19:18.125,00:19:19.416,Just like Scoot!
00:19:19.458,00:19:29.041,"Yes, but as you get older, Scoot, the pelagic phase passes, and a new one, the benthic phase, begins."
00:19:29.083,00:19:30.791,What happens in that phase?
00:19:30.833,00:19:33.166,Please be playing.
00:19:33.208,00:19:42.333,"Well, the benthic phase is when you stop drifting the currents every day, and you start looking for a place to call home."
00:19:42.375,00:19:44.708,Oh.
00:19:44.750,00:19:46.875,"Ha, you did come here for a reason."
00:19:46.916,00:19:50.791,Your instincts were bringing you to Reeftown because it would make a great home for you.
00:19:50.833,00:19:53.166,- You think?
00:19:53.208,00:19:55.208,"He's got a point there, Scoot."
00:19:55.250,00:19:59.250,Reeftown has everything a sea turtle is looking for in a home.
00:19:59.291,00:20:04.208,"It's safe, it's secure, and, ha, it's got plenty of food."
00:20:04.250,00:20:06.625,"Well, those are all great things."
00:20:06.666,00:20:10.291,But what about the most important thing?
00:20:10.333,00:20:12.500,- Fun!
00:20:12.541,00:20:16.458,There's plenty of fun to be had in Reeftown.
00:20:16.500,00:20:20.958,Let the Reeftown fun tour begin!
00:20:21.000,00:20:24.958,"- Oh, oh, easy there!"
00:20:25.000,00:20:27.291,- Whoo!
00:20:27.333,00:20:29.291,- Here I come!
00:20:29.333,00:20:31.333,I learned this one on the currents.
00:20:31.375,00:20:33.250,"- What? Oh, whoa!"
00:20:33.291,00:20:36.291,"You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly fast."
00:20:36.333,00:20:39.791,"Yeah, but you know what, I think Scoot's having a really good time."
00:20:39.833,00:20:42.541,"Hey, you know, maybe if we're lucky, he'll want to stay in Reeftown."
00:20:42.583,00:20:44.958,"Oh, that would be so much fun!"
00:20:45.000,00:20:47.458,"- Oh, nice, Ripple."
00:20:47.500,00:20:48.583,- That's right.
00:20:48.625,00:20:51.291,- Wa-hoo!
00:20:51.333,00:20:54.333,"- Ooh, got it!"
00:20:55.875,00:20:59.750,"All right, Scoot!"
00:20:59.791,00:21:01.916,Look out below!
00:21:01.958,00:21:05.333,Whoa! Look-- I'm doing-- I'm doing it!
00:21:05.375,00:21:10.625,- Ahhh!
00:21:12.250,00:21:14.541,"Ohh, ahhh! Whoa!"
00:21:14.583,00:21:17.833,"Whoa, yeah!"
00:21:26.333,00:21:28.083,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:21:32.583,00:21:37.041,Ha ha! Whoo-hoo!
00:21:37.083,00:21:39.125,"Yeah, whoo-hoo!"
00:21:42.291,00:21:44.291,"Nice job, Scoot."
00:21:44.333,00:21:46.458,So what do you think about Reeftown now?
00:21:46.500,00:21:48.333,"Oh, it's great."
00:21:48.375,00:21:52.791,"As soon as I'm ready to settle down, I'm coming back to Reeftown."
00:21:52.833,00:21:55.500,But we thought you were starting your bento phase.
00:21:55.541,00:21:57.083,"Oh, uh, benthic."
00:21:57.125,00:21:59.458,"- Oh, right. Uh, that."
00:21:59.500,00:22:08.583,"Well, I am, but still have a little time left on my pelagic phase, so I'm gonna get all that current riding out of my system for, oh, another year or two."
00:22:08.625,00:22:11.583,- A year or two?
00:22:11.625,00:22:19.583,"I know that seems like a long time, kids, but us hawksbill sea turtles can live for more than 50 years."
00:22:19.625,00:22:22.291,So a year isn't long at all for us.
00:22:22.333,00:22:26.125,"Yeah, I guess so, but... a year?"
00:22:26.166,00:22:28.416,Yeah.
00:22:28.458,00:22:33.291,"I gotta get back to doing what I do, drifting on the currents."
00:22:33.333,00:22:36.958,But I really want to thank you for today.
00:22:37.000,00:22:41.916,"Oh, you're welcome, Scoot, I hope we helped with your loneliness for a little while, at least."
00:22:41.958,00:22:50.416,"You definitely did, and when this whole benthic phase really gets going and I'm ready to look for a home, Reeftown is gonna be the first place that I look."
00:22:50.458,00:22:53.375,"Well, we can't wait till you come back."
00:22:53.416,00:22:55.333,Have fun on the currents.
00:22:55.375,00:22:58.833,Are you kidding?
00:22:58.875,00:23:01.541,- Bye!
00:01:02.083,00:01:04.833,Morning! Early tide coming in later today.
00:01:04.875,00:01:06.916,"Safe travels, everyone!"
00:01:06.958,00:01:08.791,"- Hmm, let's see."
00:01:08.833,00:01:10.708,Just saw one of these yesterday.
00:01:10.750,00:01:14.125,"- Oh, oh, there it is!"
00:01:14.166,00:01:17.458,Wow!
00:01:17.500,00:01:20.125,"You are a good fish finder, Splash."
00:01:21.458,00:01:25.083,"Give me any species of fish to find, and I'll find it."
00:01:25.125,00:01:28.250,"All right, then."
00:01:28.291,00:01:30.250,Parrotfish.
00:01:36.041,00:01:37.083,What're you doing?
00:01:37.125,00:01:39.333,Shh.
00:01:39.375,00:01:43.333,You're never gonna find a parrotfish with your eyes closed!
00:01:43.375,00:01:45.125,"Oh, really?"
00:01:45.166,00:01:49.125,I'm listening for the loud chomping sound a parrotfish makes when they clean the coral.
00:01:49.166,00:01:51.041,- And guess what.
00:01:51.083,00:01:53.250,I found it.
00:01:53.291,00:01:54.666,"- Hey there, Splash."
00:01:54.708,00:01:56.833,- See?
00:01:56.875,00:01:59.791,- Thank you.
00:01:59.833,00:02:02.958,- You kids playing fish finder?
00:02:03.000,00:02:05.041,We sure are.
00:02:05.083,00:02:09.083,"Uh, well, in my day, I was one of the reef's greatest fish finders."
00:02:09.125,00:02:14.458,"In fact, of all the times I ever played, there was only one creature I couldn't find."
00:02:14.500,00:02:17.875,"- Wow, what was it?"
00:02:17.916,00:02:21.083,I don't think I've ever heard of a horned whale before.
00:02:21.125,00:02:24.000,"- Well, what did it look like?"
00:02:21.125,00:02:32.416,"- Horned whales are white, just like the arctic ice they live near, and have a big horn on their heads that can break up large blocks of ice into tiny pieces."
00:02:32.458,00:02:37.500,And you can find them by listening for their beautiful whistling.
00:02:37.541,00:02:45.166,"I searched all over the icy waters of the Arctic, - but I never found one."
00:02:45.208,00:02:50.458,"I mean, I-- I wish I could've found it, but, uh... what can you do, right?"
00:02:50.500,00:02:51.791,Yeah.
00:02:51.833,00:02:53.958,"Well, uh, it was great talking to you, Gush."
00:02:54.000,00:02:56.541,"- Uh, Bubbles, you wanna..."
00:02:56.583,00:02:59.791,- Yeah.
00:03:04.375,00:03:08.000,"Bubbles, don't we know a whale with a horn on its head who breaks ice?"
00:03:08.041,00:03:11.375,"Well, it kinda sounds like Whistler, but he doesn't have a horn on his head."
00:03:11.416,00:03:13.250,- He has a tusk.
00:03:11.416,00:03:17.125,"- Well, yeah, but-- but it looks like a horn, and maybe whoever told Gush about it got it confused."
00:03:17.166,00:03:21.916,"Ooh, and narwhals definitely have a beautiful whistle."
00:03:21.958,00:03:23.916,I think you may be right.
00:03:23.958,00:03:30.666,"The creature that Gush is calling a horned whale is really a narwhal, just like our friend Whistler!"
00:03:30.708,00:03:34.291,But we need to tell Gush what he's looking for.
00:03:34.333,00:03:37.333,"Oh, no, no, no, no, Bubbles, Bubbles, we can't tell him."
00:03:37.375,00:03:40.916,"For Gush to be able to complete his list, he has to find Whistler for himself."
00:03:40.958,00:03:44.750,So let's take Gush to the Arctic to help him find Whistler.
00:03:44.791,00:03:46.458,That's a great idea!
00:03:52.708,00:03:56.500,"So, uh, you kids going on another one of your adventures?"
00:03:56.541,00:03:59.041,"We were wondering if, uh, you wanna join us today."
00:03:59.083,00:04:02.000,What? Me?
00:04:02.041,00:04:03.541,- Yeah.
00:04:05.625,00:04:08.916,We're going to look for the horned whale.
00:04:08.958,00:04:15.250,"Thanks, but, uh, I spent so long looking for it, I don't know if I can do another disappointing search."
00:04:15.291,00:04:18.083,"Oh, you won't be disappointed."
00:04:18.125,00:04:22.750,Because we know someone who knows all about the horned whale.
00:04:22.791,00:04:25.000,- Really?
00:04:25.041,00:04:28.416,Don't you wanna find the one that got away?
00:04:28.458,00:04:34.500,"Well, I guess today is the day I finally find the white horned whale!"
00:04:34.541,00:04:36.708,That's the spirit!
00:04:36.750,00:04:39.166,So we'll have to hop on a current to get there.
00:04:39.208,00:04:41.500,"- All right, let's do it."
00:04:41.541,00:04:42.916,- Yeah!
00:05:47.166,00:05:53.166,So something tells me our friend who knows about the horned whale is around here somewhere.
00:05:53.208,00:05:55.416,"Oh, boy, my fins are shaking."
00:05:55.458,00:06:00.833,"I can't tell if I'm excited to be back looking for the horned whale or, uh, this water's freezing."
00:06:00.875,00:06:02.333,You're right about that.
00:06:02.375,00:06:05.625,"We warm-water fish can't spend too much time - in this, uh..."
00:06:07.250,00:06:08.958,Freezing water.
00:06:09.000,00:06:11.250,Huh.
00:06:11.291,00:06:15.583,Is that the sound of a-- The whistle of the horned whale.
00:06:15.625,00:06:17.958,The sound is coming from...
00:06:18.000,00:06:20.125,- This way!
00:06:20.166,00:06:23.000,"If we can hear the whistle, the horned whale must be close!"
00:06:23.041,00:06:26.458,"- Let's go, go, go!"
00:06:26.500,00:06:29.541,We're right behind you!
00:06:36.625,00:06:40.000,I can't believe it.
00:06:40.041,00:06:43.750,"Ah, it sure is, Gush, and you found it."
00:06:43.791,00:06:46.750,"Uh, yeah, I guess I did."
00:06:46.791,00:06:51.125,"I don't wanna ruin your moment, but, uh, it's getting away."
00:06:51.166,00:06:52.916,Huh?!
00:06:52.958,00:06:55.916,I can't get this close and not meet my horned whale!
00:06:55.958,00:06:57.708,- Yeah!
00:06:57.750,00:06:59.125,Where did it go?
00:06:59.166,00:07:03.166,"Well, uh, let's split up so Gush can see the horned whale."
00:07:03.208,00:07:05.500,"- Yeah, good idea."
00:07:05.541,00:07:07.000,Uh... hmm.
00:07:07.041,00:07:09.000,"Uh, come on, Whistler."
00:07:09.041,00:07:10.916,"Hey, kids, I found it."
00:07:10.958,00:07:12.958,It's heading straight for us.
00:07:13.000,00:07:16.000,It's heading straight for us!
00:07:16.041,00:07:19.083,- Wow.
00:07:19.125,00:07:22.833,I can't believe my eyes.
00:07:24.166,00:07:26.708,Whoa.
00:07:26.750,00:07:29.958,"Ah, sorry, kids."
00:07:30.000,00:07:32.166,I didn't see you there.
00:07:32.208,00:07:34.666,"Oh, hey there, new friend."
00:07:34.708,00:07:36.333,Name's Whistler.
00:07:36.375,00:07:40.083,I knew he was around here somewhere.
00:07:40.125,00:07:41.708,"Sure am, friend."
00:07:41.750,00:07:45.208,What?
00:07:45.250,00:07:47.958,He's just been looking for you a really long time.
00:07:48.000,00:07:51.000,I've been searching for a horned whale for years.
00:07:51.041,00:07:52.875,Horned whale?
00:07:52.916,00:07:57.416,"Well, it seems that I may have some bad news."
00:07:57.458,00:08:01.166,"See, there's no such thing as a horned whale."
00:08:01.208,00:08:03.083,I'm a narwhal.
00:08:03.125,00:08:07.083,A narwhal?
00:08:07.125,00:08:13.125,"Actually, Gush, that's a tusk on top of his head, not a horn, and he can do something really cool with it."
00:08:13.166,00:08:15.000,"- Right, Whistler?"
00:08:15.041,00:08:16.833,"- How did you know-- - Why, that's right."
00:08:16.875,00:08:19.041,"You tell him, Splash."
00:08:19.083,00:08:28.541,"See, Narwhals need to breathe air from time to time, so I use my tusk to find the best spot to break the ice and get to the air, watch this."
00:08:28.583,00:08:33.708,"Ah, here's a good spot."
00:08:36.458,00:08:38.166,- Whoa.
00:08:38.208,00:08:42.791,"Aw, shucks, guys, it's nothing you haven't seen before."
00:08:42.833,00:08:48.458,"Hmm, so, uh, you know Whistler?"
00:08:48.500,00:08:50.291,And you knew he was gonna be here all along.
00:08:50.333,00:08:57.791,"- Well, uh, Gush, uh, you kind of remember that, uh, friend of ours who knows all about the horned whale?"
00:08:57.833,00:08:59.833,"- Well, uh, it's him."
00:08:59.875,00:09:02.458,You're still the one who found him.
00:09:02.500,00:09:05.166,"We just led you to where he lived, that's all."
00:09:05.208,00:09:07.750,"Boy, you kids sure have a lot of..."
00:09:07.791,00:09:11.500,heart to do something like that for me.
00:09:11.541,00:09:13.000,Thank you so much.
00:09:13.041,00:09:16.958,"So was I everything you were hoping for, Gush?"
00:09:17.000,00:09:21.875,"Uh, it's just that, um..."
00:09:21.916,00:09:23.250,- What?
00:09:21.916,00:09:26.541,"- Well, someone told me that a horned wh-- I mean, uh, narwhals..."
00:09:26.583,00:09:29.791,are white just like the ice of the Arctic.
00:09:32.791,00:09:36.791,"Well, whoever told you that was telling you the truth."
00:09:36.833,00:09:39.291,Huh?
00:09:36.833,00:09:46.541,"But, uh, Whistler, you're, uh-- well, You got me there, Splash, but narwhals change color throughout their lives."
00:09:46.583,00:09:49.625,- Wh-- really?
00:09:49.666,00:09:54.375,Little baby narwhals are born a light blue-gray color and get darker as they grow.
00:09:54.416,00:10:01.875,"Adults are kind of gray like me, and then, really old narwhals turn almost completely white."
00:10:01.916,00:10:06.291,So...
00:10:06.333,00:10:09.291,Must have seen an old narwhal.
00:10:09.333,00:10:10.875,Amazing!
00:10:10.916,00:10:16.416,Thank you all for making this horned wh-- Now you got me saying it.
00:10:16.458,00:10:22.416,"But anyhoo, thanks for making this little old narwhal feel, um, so special."
00:10:22.458,00:10:24.250,"But, Whistler, you are special."
00:10:24.291,00:10:30.958,"I mean, where else but in the ocean would you find a creature as unique and amazing as a narwhal?"
00:11:00.875,00:11:03.500,"Kids, I have to thank you again."
00:11:03.541,00:11:10.708,I could spend all day here and I still don't think I'd believe I finally got to meet my narwhal.
00:11:10.750,00:11:12.208,What a day.
00:11:12.250,00:11:15.666,"Yeah, um..."
00:11:15.708,00:11:20.083,"It's been great hanging out with you, Whistler, but, uh, I got a little chill here."
00:11:20.125,00:11:22.458,"It's okay, B-B-B-B-Bubbles."
00:11:22.500,00:11:29.208,"Uh, like you said earlier, we warm-water f-f-f-f-fish can't stay in this f-f-f-f-freezing water too long."
00:11:29.250,00:11:35.166,"Yeah, this trip has been really f-f-f-f-fun, but I think it's time we head back to the warm waters of Reeftown."
00:11:35.208,00:11:37.208,"Aw, do we have to?"
00:11:37.250,00:11:40.583,"- Okay, maybe we do."
00:11:40.625,00:11:42.333,"It's been a pleasure meeting you, Whistler."
00:11:42.375,00:11:44.000,"Swell meeting you too, Gush."
00:11:44.041,00:11:47.625,You're all welcome to come back here and see me soon.
00:11:47.666,00:11:51.833,"Oh, I certainly will, now that I know where to, uh, find you, that is."
00:11:51.875,00:11:53.458,"Yeah, well, uh, bye, Whistler."
00:11:53.500,00:11:55.666,"- Yeah, bye, Whistler!"
00:11:55.708,00:11:56.916,So long!
00:11:56.958,00:11:59.625,"Oh, gotta breathe."
00:12:04.041,00:12:10.833,Where is that Splash?
00:12:15.208,00:12:18.458,"Oh, I love playing shark tag."
00:12:18.500,00:12:21.666,You never know when the shark is gonna come.
00:12:24.541,00:12:27.666,"Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp."
00:12:27.708,00:12:31.541,"You're right, Ripple."
00:12:35.625,00:12:37.583,- Shark tag!
00:12:37.625,00:12:39.250,"- Oh, no, swim away!"
00:12:39.291,00:12:40.833,- Swim away! Swim away!
00:12:39.291,00:12:42.916,"- Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp."
00:12:42.958,00:12:45.791,- Is that him?
00:12:45.833,00:12:48.083,"- Oh, Bubbles?"
00:12:48.125,00:12:49.500,- Shark tag!
00:12:49.541,00:12:52.166,- Chomp.
00:12:52.208,00:12:54.166,- I love this game.
00:12:54.208,00:12:56.250,"Aw, it's okay, Bubbles."
00:12:56.291,00:12:59.250,You don't have to cry.
00:12:59.291,00:13:00.958,I'm sure you'll win next time.
00:13:01.000,00:13:04.000,"But that crying isn't coming from me, Ripple."
00:13:04.041,00:13:05.375,Me either.
00:13:05.416,00:13:07.666,Sounds like it's coming from up there.
00:13:07.708,00:13:11.041,"Huh. Well, don't worry, guys."
00:13:11.083,00:13:16.250,"Uh, I'm sure we can help whoever's doing all this, uh-- uh..."
00:13:16.291,00:13:18.541,crying.
00:13:18.583,00:13:22.750,"- Uh, uh, excuse me, sir?"
00:13:22.791,00:13:29.375,"I, uh-- I, uh, couldn't help noticing that you were, uh, crying, uh, which is fine."
00:13:29.416,00:13:31.583,"I mean, uh, we can all use a good cry now and then."
00:13:31.625,00:13:34.166,- I wasn't crying.
00:13:34.208,00:13:36.125,"I was, uh...laughing!"
00:13:36.166,00:13:38.375,"Yeah, uh, that's it."
00:13:40.625,00:13:43.125,"Uh, I-I simply heard a funny joke."
00:13:43.166,00:13:46.125,"Is that okay with you, little fish?"
00:13:46.166,00:13:48.791,Me?
00:13:48.833,00:13:51.416,"I mean, we all love a good joke, right?"
00:13:51.458,00:13:54.541,You don't have to answer that.
00:13:54.583,00:13:56.833,"I'm just gonna probably go-- uh, bye."
00:13:56.875,00:13:58.500,Salmon says flap your fins.
00:13:58.541,00:14:01.125,"- Flap, flap, flap, flap."
00:13:58.541,00:14:03.750,"- Hi, Splash - Oh."
00:14:03.791,00:14:05.000,Are they okay?
00:14:07.208,00:14:10.583,"Yes, we know you won shark tag."
00:14:10.625,00:14:16.458,"Oh, no, I'm not, it's just, the creature that was crying was a great white shark."
00:14:16.500,00:14:19.000,- Oh.
00:14:16.500,00:14:21.750,"- Oh, well, then, we should-- Leave immediately."
00:14:21.791,00:14:23.458,Wait a minute.
00:14:23.500,00:14:26.125,Great white sharks are really big and tough.
00:14:26.166,00:14:28.083,Agreed.
00:14:28.125,00:14:32.666,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but they're so big and tough, and this one is crying."
00:14:32.708,00:14:35.000,That may mean he needs our help.
00:14:35.041,00:14:36.458,- Huh?
00:14:36.500,00:14:43.583,"Ripple's right, and as Reeftown Rangers, it's our duty to go and talk to that shark - and see what's wrong."
00:14:43.625,00:14:47.166,Maybe we can help him.
00:14:47.208,00:14:48.875,"Oh, he's, uh-- he's right up here. Follow me."
00:14:57.833,00:15:02.416,My friends and I wanted to make sure everything was okay with you.
00:15:02.458,00:15:04.708,"Uh, just one quick question."
00:15:04.750,00:15:10.750,"You, by any chance, aren't crying because you're, uh, hungry, are you?"
00:15:10.791,00:15:12.708,"Oh, don't worry."
00:15:16.416,00:15:24.458,"You see, the reason I've been, uh, crying is that I have a very bad toothache."
00:15:24.500,00:15:26.791,It's very painful.
00:15:26.833,00:15:29.333,"Oh, that's great."
00:15:29.375,00:15:30.875,- Huh?
00:15:30.916,00:15:34.250,"Y-- oh, uh, well-- oh, I--not the painful part, sir."
00:15:34.291,00:15:37.791,"Uh, what's great is, uh, we know someone who can help fix your teeth."
00:15:37.833,00:15:42.916,Denny the cleaner shrimp.
00:15:42.958,00:15:44.958,I'm sure she can fix you right up.
00:15:45.000,00:15:47.833,"Oh, that shrimp sounds pretty good."
00:15:49.916,00:15:53.291,Not eating good.
00:15:53.333,00:15:54.833,- Oh!
00:15:54.875,00:15:58.500,"Well, uh, we'll be right back, then, sir."
00:15:58.541,00:15:59.916,"Reeftown Rangers, come on."
00:15:59.958,00:16:01.750,We've got a new ocean creature to help.
00:16:03.041,00:16:04.708,- Whoo!
00:16:55.875,00:16:57.541,Come on!
00:17:24.333,00:17:28.000,Let's go!
00:17:38.958,00:17:41.916,"- Oh, no, she didn't."
00:17:41.958,00:17:43.958,- Then what did he say?
00:17:44.000,00:17:46.250,Ha!
00:17:46.291,00:17:48.083,It's like he's right here in the cove!
00:17:48.125,00:17:52.791,"Okay, you're all clear, Maury."
00:17:52.833,00:17:55.458,- Are you here for a cleaning?
00:17:52.833,00:17:57.875,"- Well, sort of, but this isn't your normal cleaning."
00:17:57.916,00:17:59.791,"Oh, well, don't worry about Denny."
00:17:59.833,00:18:02.750,She's seen it all.
00:18:05.208,00:18:09.958,- It's a great white shark.
00:18:10.000,00:18:14.166,"Uh, well, I have a thing with a thing, so, uh, bye."
00:18:14.208,00:18:17.291,A great white shark?
00:18:17.333,00:18:24.333,"Uh, well, uh, I know this is a little bit, uh, trickier than your usual cleaning, but-- I've been waiting for this moment my whole life."
00:18:26.416,00:18:29.291,- Did you just say you'll do it?
00:18:29.333,00:18:35.875,Cleaning the mouth of a great white shark is the absolute greatest achievement a cleaner shrimp can hope to have!
00:18:38.208,00:18:41.375,Did you know what great whites have hundreds of teeth?
00:18:41.416,00:18:44.291,- Hundreds?
00:18:44.333,00:18:46.625,"Now, where is this shark?"
00:18:46.666,00:18:50.916,"Hmm, this may be a little tougher than I thought."
00:18:50.958,00:18:58.958,"I don't know, are you really sure this tiny shrimp can help a big tough, mighty shark like-- - Ooh, owie, owie, owie!"
00:18:59.000,00:19:01.541,"Uh, you were saying?"
00:19:01.583,00:19:07.250,"Uh, I was just saying, uh, I'm sure Denny will be a great help."
00:19:07.291,00:19:08.708,"Oh, I see the problem."
00:19:08.750,00:19:14.125,"A pebble is stuck between two of your teeth, which is stopping one of the teeth from falling out."
00:19:14.166,00:19:15.958,"Um, well, why is that a problem?"
00:19:16.000,00:19:19.291,Aren't teeth falling out a bad thing?
00:19:19.333,00:19:24.916,"For some creatures, yes, but a great white's teeth fall out and get replaced by new ones all the time."
00:19:24.958,00:19:28.791,So this one getting stuck is causing a tooth traffic jam.
00:19:28.833,00:19:33.833,Let me see if I can just move this-- - Ow!
00:19:33.875,00:19:37.333,"Okay, kids, I'm gonna need your help here."
00:19:37.375,00:19:39.666,Keep him calm and still so I can loosen this tooth.
00:19:39.708,00:19:44.083,"We're on it. Okay, uh, calm."
00:19:44.125,00:19:50.041,"Well, they say, uh, laughter is the best medicine, so, uh, hey, do you like jokes?"
00:19:50.083,00:19:54.125,- No.
00:19:54.166,00:19:57.750,"- Okay, uh, now what do we do?"
00:19:54.166,00:19:59.750,- There's a little trick we cleaner shrimps have tried in the past.
00:19:59.791,00:20:04.666,"If you can, get the shark to flip over so his belly faces the surface."
00:20:06.708,00:20:08.833,"Oh, really?"
00:20:08.875,00:20:10.791,"And, uh, how do we do that?"
00:20:10.833,00:20:14.708,He's way too heavy to move.
00:20:14.750,00:20:17.208,- Ah! Sir!
00:20:17.250,00:20:19.791,"Would you flip over, please?"
00:20:19.833,00:20:21.625,"Uh, no."
00:20:21.666,00:20:24.458,"Well, I'm out of ideas."
00:20:26.208,00:20:27.750,"Hey, look at me."
00:20:27.791,00:20:30.875,"Uh, okay, I know you're nervous, but that's okay."
00:20:30.916,00:20:35.041,"I get nervous all the time, and my friend Ripple here..."
00:20:35.083,00:20:37.541,- Uh...
00:20:37.583,00:20:40.541,My friend Ripple is really good at calming me down.
00:20:40.583,00:20:42.083,"- Yes, okay, hi."
00:20:42.125,00:20:44.125,- Calm down how?
00:20:44.166,00:20:48.041,"Well, okay, think."
00:20:48.083,00:20:54.041,You are a lone piece of kelp slowly floating in the current.
00:20:54.083,00:20:55.083,Can you see it?
00:20:55.125,00:20:57.833,"I, uh..."
00:20:57.875,00:20:59.958,- Ah!
00:21:00.000,00:21:01.833,"Whatever you're doing, keep it up."
00:21:04.291,00:21:07.583,All is calm for the kelp blade.
00:21:07.625,00:21:11.166,Floating along without a care in the world.
00:21:11.208,00:21:13.500,- See the kelp.
00:21:13.541,00:21:16.708,- Be the kelp.
00:21:16.750,00:21:22.583,And now the current flutters the kelp blade so it slowly...
00:21:22.625,00:21:26.208,turns... around.
00:21:27.833,00:21:30.125,"That's it, guys."
00:21:30.166,00:21:31.583,This is amazing.
00:21:31.625,00:21:34.333,He's not-- he's not moving at all.
00:21:34.375,00:21:37.125,And breathe...
00:21:39.250,00:21:41.583,- Got it!
00:21:41.625,00:21:43.833,"I got the pebble free, and the tooth came right out."
00:21:43.875,00:21:46.875,And turn....
00:21:50.791,00:21:53.083,"- Hey, I-I feel better already."
00:21:53.125,00:21:56.000,I can't believe it's all done!
00:21:56.041,00:21:58.500,See?
00:21:58.541,00:22:00.416,"You know, it really wasn't."
00:22:00.458,00:22:03.208,I got all worked up over nothing.
00:22:03.250,00:22:05.875,"- Well, thanks!"
00:22:05.916,00:22:07.500,The work is its own reward.
00:22:07.541,00:22:11.291,"And thank you, kids, for convincing me to go through with this."
00:22:11.333,00:22:15.291,"Well, you may be little, but you're as tough as any shark I've ever met."
00:22:17.000,00:22:19.416,"Well, bye!"
00:22:19.458,00:22:21.583,- Bye!
00:22:21.625,00:22:23.375,- Nice meeting you!
00:22:23.416,00:22:28.208,"I need to thank you kids, too, for helping me finally achieve my dream."
00:22:28.250,00:22:30.250,What?
00:22:30.291,00:22:32.125,"But, Denny, you did all the work."
00:22:32.166,00:22:34.083,That was incredible!
00:22:34.125,00:22:39.625,No one in Reeftown is going to believe that you fixed the tooth of a great white.
00:22:39.666,00:22:43.041,"Oh, I wouldn't be so sure of that."
00:22:43.083,00:22:44.791,- Whoa!
00:22:44.833,00:22:47.041,- Look at it!
00:22:47.083,00:22:49.333,Can you help me carry this?
00:22:49.375,00:22:51.583,- Yeah!
00:22:51.625,00:22:53.416,"Wow, you have a great white shark's tooth."
00:22:53.458,00:22:55.125,- Wow.
00:22:55.166,00:22:57.458,- What a cool thing to have!
00:22:57.500,00:22:58.916,"- Oh, we have to show this to Zee."
00:22:58.958,00:23:00.625,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:01:02.250,00:01:07.666,"Rise and shine, everybody!"
00:01:07.708,00:01:11.333,Do you know what today is?
00:01:11.375,00:01:13.625,A day you woke us up too early?
00:01:13.666,00:01:16.250,"Aw, I'm sorry, Dunk."
00:01:16.291,00:01:18.958,That's okay.
00:01:19.000,00:01:21.375,"- Wake up, Dunk!!"
00:01:21.416,00:01:24.000,Who? What? Why?
00:01:24.041,00:01:27.666,"Well, today is something very special."
00:01:27.708,00:01:29.250,- It is?
00:01:29.291,00:01:30.833,What's going on?
00:01:30.875,00:01:36.125,Wha-- today is the anniversary of the day that Splash came to Reeftown!
00:01:36.166,00:01:38.291,"It is? Hey, Ripple!"
00:01:38.333,00:01:41.333,It's Splash's day he moved to Reeftown anniversary!
00:01:41.375,00:01:43.000,We should have thought about that!
00:01:43.041,00:01:44.250,What are we gonna do?
00:01:44.291,00:01:46.208,"Oh, we've already got that covered."
00:01:46.250,00:01:47.750,- We do?
00:01:47.791,00:01:54.291,We've got a great day planned for The Day That Splash Moved To Reeftown Anniversary Celebration.
00:01:56.875,00:01:58.458,"Of course we did, buddy!"
00:01:58.500,00:02:03.250,You think we'd forget about an important thing like the Day You Moved To Reeftown anniversary?
00:02:03.291,00:02:05.791,"Aw, well, that's so nice."
00:02:05.833,00:02:08.375,"So what are we gonna do to celebrate today, guys?"
00:02:08.416,00:02:09.791,"Yeah, what are we gonna do?"
00:02:15.208,00:02:19.000,"I mean, uh, we could do that thing..."
00:02:19.041,00:02:21.583,or that other thing...
00:02:21.625,00:02:31.833,"We were thinking that we could remember back to all the fun things we did together when you first came to Reeftown, and, uh, do 'em again!"
00:02:31.875,00:02:36.083,That sounds like a lot of fun!
00:02:36.125,00:02:38.541,Oh! Play in a mud puddle?
00:02:40.500,00:02:43.291,Yeah! Or go down the big slide at Dorsal Park!
00:02:43.333,00:02:45.875,"So what do you think we should do first, Splash?"
00:02:45.916,00:02:50.625,"Hmm, I think we should do all of those things!"
00:02:50.666,00:02:53.000,We can each prepare one fun thing to do with you.
00:02:53.041,00:02:54.875,- Sounds great!
00:02:54.916,00:02:57.083,Gotcha. I'm going off to make some sand art.
00:02:59.250,00:03:02.083,And I'm gonna find the muddiest mud puddle ever!
00:03:02.125,00:03:03.708,Great!
00:03:03.750,00:03:05.916,Wanna go on the slide with me while we're waiting?
00:03:05.958,00:03:07.958,Sure!
00:03:08.000,00:03:10.458,- Okie dokey!
00:03:10.500,00:03:12.833,Whoo-hoo! Ah!
00:03:44.000,00:03:45.708,Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
00:04:13.375,00:04:15.500,Ha-ha! Yeah!
00:04:15.541,00:04:20.166,Ah ha! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
00:04:20.208,00:04:26.958,I think I'll call this masterpiece Art For My Friend Splash.
00:04:27.000,00:04:29.583,Huh? Huh?
00:04:29.625,00:04:31.958,"Guys, I know you're back there!"
00:04:32.000,00:04:36.958,"If you want to see my sand pattern, just come out and look!"
00:04:41.250,00:04:43.416,Another puffer fish?
00:04:43.458,00:04:45.125,Are you my twin?
00:04:45.166,00:04:49.833,"Hi, my name is Puffy."
00:04:49.875,00:04:51.458,Who are you?
00:04:51.500,00:04:54.208,I'm Dunk.
00:04:54.250,00:04:56.000,But you don't sound like me.
00:04:56.041,00:05:02.958,That's 'cause I'm a girl puffer fish and you're a boy puffer fish.
00:05:03.000,00:05:06.875,"Right, I'm a boy puffer fish."
00:05:06.916,00:05:09.750,- You're funny!
00:05:12.375,00:05:15.208,So where did you come from?
00:05:15.250,00:05:25.083,"I live on another reef, and, well, I was just swimming by, and, well, I came to tell you that I really like your sand art."
00:05:25.125,00:05:26.291,Oh!
00:05:26.333,00:05:28.833,"Uh, this usually doesn't happen."
00:05:28.875,00:05:30.125,I'm just a little bit..
00:05:30.166,00:05:31.791,Nervous?
00:05:31.833,00:05:33.916,- Yeah.
00:05:33.958,00:05:36.000,Your art is so detailed.
00:05:36.041,00:05:40.125,"The patterns are beautiful, and, uh-- ah!"
00:05:40.166,00:05:43.208,"Hey! You puffed up, too!"
00:05:43.250,00:05:45.083,So is it noticeable?
00:05:45.125,00:05:48.125,You bet it is!
00:05:48.166,00:05:49.666,Really?
00:05:51.250,00:05:53.083,Of course!
00:05:53.125,00:05:58.000,"Finally, someone else who really understands what it's like to be a puffer fish."
00:05:58.041,00:06:01.708,"Um, well, I'm really glad to know you, Dunk."
00:06:01.750,00:06:05.500,"And, um, maybe you can show me around your reef?"
00:06:05.541,00:06:07.583,I'd really like to see it.
00:06:07.625,00:06:10.000,I'd love to show it to you.
00:06:18.666,00:06:23.041,"Yes, yes, and yes!"
00:06:23.083,00:06:26.208,"Hey, guys!"
00:06:26.250,00:06:29.750,"- Oh, that's great, Bubbles!"
00:06:31.500,00:06:34.083,"Hey, uh..."
00:06:34.125,00:06:36.041,I thought he'd be here by now.
00:06:36.083,00:06:37.541,He said he was gonna make some sand art.
00:06:37.583,00:06:39.916,It's taking him a long time.
00:06:39.958,00:06:41.375,"Well, let's go find him!"
00:06:41.416,00:06:45.333,Let the anniversary celebration continue!
00:06:45.375,00:06:46.666,- Whoo-hoo!
00:06:46.708,00:06:49.375,- Happy anniversary!
00:06:49.416,00:06:52.000,- There's his sand art.
00:06:54.333,00:06:57.291,"Hmm, um, oh!"
00:06:57.333,00:06:59.041,- Oh! Okay.
00:06:59.083,00:07:00.750,"Hi, Chompy!"
00:07:00.791,00:07:02.333,"Oh, hi, kids!"
00:07:02.375,00:07:04.958,Where are my manners?
00:07:05.000,00:07:07.083,Talking with my mouth full again!
00:07:07.125,00:07:08.500,"That's okay, Chompy."
00:07:08.541,00:07:10.291,We were wondering if you've seen Dunk?
00:07:10.333,00:07:15.916,"Sure, I've seen the original Dunk and the Dunk of another color, kinda pinkish?"
00:07:15.958,00:07:17.333,- They went that way.
00:07:17.375,00:07:20.500,Dunk of another color?
00:07:20.541,00:07:23.625,"Well, maybe we should go back to the slide and wait for him?"
00:07:27.416,00:07:30.916,Say hi to Dunk and Dunk of Another Color for me!
00:07:30.958,00:07:33.166,So this is Coral Cove.
00:07:33.208,00:07:34.791,Most of my friends sleep here.
00:07:34.833,00:07:38.000,"Oh, hey, Gush, this is my new friend, Puffy."
00:07:38.041,00:07:39.416,"Oh, nice to meet you."
00:07:39.458,00:07:41.083,"Oh, nice to meet you!"
00:07:41.125,00:07:44.708,- Gush is a frogfish.
00:07:44.750,00:07:54.041,"Yes, and some other interesting facts about frogfish are they have gills behind their fins, and they use-- And they can propel themselves with jet-powered speed."
00:07:54.083,00:07:56.916,Not to mention excellent camouflage.
00:07:56.958,00:07:59.583,"Why, thank you."
00:07:59.625,00:08:00.833,Wow!
00:08:00.875,00:08:05.666,You're my first friend who knows as much about everything on the reef as I do!
00:08:05.708,00:08:09.166,I think Dunk here has met his fin-facts match.
00:08:09.208,00:08:11.458,- I think I have.
00:08:11.500,00:08:13.458,Let me show you around Reeftown some more!
00:08:13.500,00:08:15.750,"Oh, that sounds great."
00:08:15.791,00:08:17.958,"Oh, Dunk?"
00:08:18.000,00:08:19.333,"Oh, uh, sure, Gush."
00:08:19.375,00:08:25.208,Aren't your friends expecting you today for Splash's anniversary of his first day in Reeftown?
00:08:25.250,00:08:26.750,"Oh, no!"
00:08:26.791,00:08:31.500,"I guess I got so busy showing Puffy around, I completely forgot."
00:08:31.541,00:08:34.416,I think Ripple said they were waiting for you at the slide.
00:08:34.458,00:08:39.000,But I have Puffy with me.
00:08:39.041,00:08:40.375,So?
00:08:40.416,00:08:43.125,So...
00:08:43.166,00:08:48.208,"Or what if they like her too much, and then she doesn't have time for me?"
00:08:48.250,00:08:50.458,Just introduce Puffy to your friends.
00:08:50.500,00:08:54.250,I guarantee you can make new friends and keep the old.
00:08:54.291,00:08:56.625,"Gush, you are very wise."
00:08:56.666,00:08:59.250,And don't forget my jet powers!
00:08:59.291,00:09:01.708,Wow!
00:09:01.750,00:09:03.625,- Wow! Jet power!
00:09:03.666,00:09:04.958,"Come on, let me show you Dorsal Park!"
00:09:05.000,00:09:06.375,All right.
00:09:06.416,00:09:09.000,- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:09:09.041,00:09:11.958,"Hey, Dunk!"
00:09:12.000,00:09:13.458,- There you are!
00:09:15.458,00:09:19.208,"Splash, Bubbles, Ripple, this is my friend Puffy."
00:09:19.250,00:09:21.750,Oh!
00:09:21.791,00:09:24.708,- Nice to meet all of you.
00:09:24.750,00:09:27.833,Did anyone ever tell you that you two look exactly alike?
00:09:27.875,00:09:30.166,Yeah.
00:09:30.208,00:09:32.541,And that's not all we have in common.
00:09:34.458,00:09:37.833,- Whoa!
00:09:37.875,00:09:40.000,- We both kinda...
00:09:41.625,00:09:44.041,"Well, uh, do you want to play on the slide with us?"
00:09:46.041,00:09:47.500,"All right, come on!"
00:09:47.541,00:09:49.208,- Great!
00:09:49.250,00:09:52.291,"Dunk, I really like your new friend, Puffy."
00:09:52.333,00:09:53.875,She's nice.
00:09:53.916,00:09:55.833,Why didn't you bring her here earlier?
00:09:55.875,00:09:59.166,"Well, I kinda wasn't so sure it'd be okay."
00:09:59.208,00:10:01.958,- You weren't?
00:09:59.208,00:10:05.666,"- Yeah, I was so excited to have a new friend that I wasn't thinking about my old friends for a while."
00:10:08.875,00:10:11.666,- But why?
00:10:08.875,00:10:16.375,- Mostly I was worried that Puffy and all of you guys wouldn't be friends and that someone would feel bad.
00:10:21.375,00:10:22.791,That's what I realized!
00:10:22.833,00:10:26.000,"Uh, right after Gush told me, that is."
00:10:26.041,00:10:28.250,"Well, I'm glad you came, Dunk."
00:10:28.291,00:10:34.125,This Anniversary of Splash Coming to Reeftown Day wouldn't have been complete without you.
00:10:34.166,00:10:35.791,"- Thanks, Ripple."
00:10:35.833,00:10:37.750,"Oh, one more piece of advice."
00:10:37.791,00:10:41.125,Show her your Daredevil Dunk Dive Slide!
00:10:41.166,00:10:42.750,She'll like that.
00:10:42.791,00:10:46.791,- Great idea!
00:10:46.833,00:10:49.250,"Whoa! Look, I'm doing it!"
00:10:55.500,00:10:58.000,- Wow!
00:10:58.041,00:11:00.583,Wow!
00:11:00.625,00:11:02.666,You should try it.
00:11:02.708,00:11:06.958,"Don't puff up in the middle of the curve, because... ouch."
00:11:07.000,00:11:09.458,Okay! Here I go!
00:11:09.500,00:11:11.416,Don't puff up in the middle of the curve!
00:11:11.458,00:11:13.208,- Puffy!
00:11:13.250,00:11:16.000,- You can do it!
00:11:16.041,00:11:17.958,"Thanks for being so nice to Puffy, guys."
00:11:18.000,00:11:20.458,"Well, of course."
00:11:20.500,00:11:22.958,I'm so glad to have friends like you.
00:11:23.000,00:11:29.166,"Oh, and Splash, I hope you've been having fun on your Anniversary of the Day You Came to Reeftown celebration."
00:11:29.208,00:11:31.958,"Oh, yeah, buddy, the best time ever!"
00:11:32.000,00:11:35.125,"In fact, you brought me the nicest anniversary surprise ever."
00:11:35.166,00:11:37.666,Someone newer to the reef than I am!
00:11:37.708,00:11:39.958,"- Go for it, Puffy!"
00:11:40.000,00:11:41.833,"- Come on, Puffy!"
00:11:41.875,00:11:48.458,"Guess that makes this Puffy's Welcome to Reeftown Day, so now we have two things to celebrate!"
00:11:48.500,00:11:52.166,- Whoo-hoo!
00:11:52.208,00:11:54.125,"All right, you guys."
00:11:54.166,00:11:56.875,Last one there's a broken barnacle!
00:11:56.916,00:11:59.250,Yeah!
00:12:10.375,00:12:13.500,I don't want any more plankton.
00:12:13.541,00:12:15.708,I just...
00:12:15.750,00:12:17.875,- Whoa!
00:12:17.916,00:12:20.083,- Whoa!
00:12:17.916,00:12:22.791,"- Whoa! Is it just me, or is the reef a little shakier than usual?"
00:12:22.833,00:12:25.000,What in the deep blue sea is going on?
00:12:25.041,00:12:28.375,"Hold on, buddy."
00:12:28.416,00:12:31.458,- What was that?
00:12:31.500,00:12:33.541,"Yeah, it happens from time to time."
00:12:33.583,00:12:36.875,"Uh, I don't remember that ever happening before."
00:12:36.916,00:12:39.750,"Well, don't worry, buddy."
00:12:39.791,00:12:43.250,Next time? You mean...
00:12:43.291,00:12:47.166,"Well, yeah, sometimes you get smaller shakes after the big shake."
00:12:47.208,00:12:49.666,It's no big deal.
00:12:49.708,00:12:53.916,"Hey, I heard there was a big shake."
00:12:53.958,00:12:56.500,Heard? You didn't feel it?
00:12:56.541,00:12:58.291,I must've slept right through it.
00:12:58.333,00:13:02.083,You slept through it?
00:13:02.125,00:13:08.416,"Well, when you have 499 brothers, you learn to sleep through a lot of commotion."
00:13:08.458,00:13:10.625,"Well, is everyone okay in there?"
00:13:10.666,00:13:13.583,"Splash, just a little messy."
00:13:13.625,00:13:15.500,But thank you for asking!
00:13:15.541,00:13:18.750,"Yeah, just a few pebbles and shells fell down."
00:13:18.791,00:13:19.833,No big deal.
00:13:19.875,00:13:21.416,I'm gonna help my papa clean up.
00:13:21.458,00:13:25.166,My brothers always put things in the wrong places.
00:13:25.208,00:13:28.375,"Anyway, gotta go!"
00:13:33.708,00:13:36.250,"- Are you all right, Splash?"
00:13:36.291,00:13:39.791,"Oh, uh, me?"
00:13:43.166,00:13:47.375,"And that's normal, apparently."
00:13:43.166,00:13:52.791,"And, uh, I, uh-- Okay, seriously, how is everyone Oh, no, Splash is gonna puff up!"
00:13:52.833,00:13:54.416,"Deep breaths, Splash."
00:13:54.458,00:13:57.500,"Dunk, fusiliers don't puff up."
00:13:57.541,00:14:00.041,"- Oh, right!"
00:13:57.541,00:14:01.958,"- Guys, I feel like I'm being really silly about this, I'm sorry."
00:14:02.000,00:14:05.250,"You're not being silly, Splash."
00:14:05.291,00:14:07.791,Anyone can get nervous after their first shake.
00:14:07.833,00:14:10.791,I know I was.
00:14:10.833,00:14:12.916,Yeah. I guess we're just used to them.
00:14:12.958,00:14:15.500,"Well, do you know what the big shake is?"
00:14:15.541,00:14:18.500,"It's, uh..."
00:14:21.083,00:14:25.000,I bet there's a perfectly good explanation for why it happens.
00:14:28.458,00:14:31.500,"Well, yeah."
00:14:31.541,00:14:33.375,You know what?
00:14:33.416,00:14:35.708,I bet he knows what causes the big shake.
00:14:35.750,00:14:38.458,"- Hey, yeah."
00:14:38.500,00:14:40.083,- Come on.
00:14:40.125,00:14:42.291,That was quite the big shake this morning.
00:14:42.333,00:14:43.625,Did you kids feel that?
00:14:43.666,00:14:46.708,"Yep, and it was Splash's first one!"
00:14:46.750,00:14:52.291,"Yeah, and we were hoping that maybe you could help me be prepared for when it happens again."
00:14:52.333,00:14:55.541,"Oh, that's a good idea because they're pretty unpredictable."
00:14:55.583,00:15:01.166,"But even if you don't know when they're gonna happen, you can always be prepared for what will happen."
00:15:01.208,00:15:03.875,"- Well, like what?"
00:15:03.916,00:15:09.916,"It'll move in all sorts of directions, - swishing back and forth."
00:15:09.958,00:15:14.000,I was like swish!
00:15:14.041,00:15:20.750,"And it can kick up loose pebbles and sand, so you should find a secure place to take shelter so nothing falls on you."
00:15:20.791,00:15:23.041,"Thanks, Gush."
00:15:23.083,00:15:25.375,"Hey, no problem!"
00:15:25.416,00:15:27.333,"- Oh, we will."
00:15:27.375,00:15:29.000,Bye!
00:15:29.041,00:15:30.583,"So, you see, Splash?"
00:15:30.625,00:15:34.083,The big shake just causes the water to swish around.
00:15:34.125,00:15:36.166,"Not so bad, right?"
00:15:36.208,00:15:38.791,"Yeah, but it felt like all of Reeftown Rock was shaking!"
00:15:38.833,00:15:42.291,Maybe we need to go deeper to solve the problem.
00:15:42.333,00:15:47.375,We need to see someone who spends all their time on rocks.
00:15:47.416,00:15:48.583,But who?
00:15:48.625,00:15:49.750,- Huh?
00:15:49.791,00:15:51.000,- Pearlene!
00:15:51.041,00:15:52.791,- Yeah!
00:15:52.833,00:15:56.125,"Ooh, I remember my first big shake."
00:15:56.166,00:15:57.833,It was all rumbly.
00:15:57.875,00:16:00.750,I thought I was gonna shake right on out of my shell!
00:16:00.791,00:16:03.750,- I sure was nervous.
00:16:05.958,00:16:08.416,"Well, except for the shell part."
00:16:08.458,00:16:11.875,"And you don't get nervous anymore, right, Pearlene?"
00:16:11.916,00:16:19.458,"Nope, sometimes it feels like the ground underneath my rock is rolling, and I just kinda go along for the ride."
00:16:19.500,00:16:23.333,The ground rolls and makes your rock shake?
00:16:23.375,00:16:30.583,"That's it, but luckily, if it gets too shaky, I always have my trusty shell to keep me safe."
00:16:30.625,00:16:32.375,- Ooh!
00:16:32.416,00:16:34.000,- Oh!
00:16:34.041,00:16:35.791,"It's okay there, Splash."
00:16:35.833,00:16:39.375,This is just another one of those little shakes that happen afterwards.
00:16:39.416,00:16:41.500,See? It's all over.
00:16:41.541,00:16:44.500,"Oh, oh, yeah."
00:16:44.541,00:16:46.666,See? All safe in here.
00:16:46.708,00:16:51.000,"Wow, that shell is handy in more ways than one!"
00:16:51.041,00:16:53.208,"Well, thanks for all your help, Pearlene!"
00:16:53.250,00:16:55.166,You're welcome.
00:16:55.208,00:16:57.208,- Bye!
00:16:57.250,00:17:01.458,"So, does the big shake start in the ocean floor?"
00:17:01.500,00:17:05.250,"Oh, it starts a lot lower than that, kids."
00:17:05.291,00:17:06.666,"- Hi, Flo!"
00:17:06.708,00:17:10.000,So it sounds like you're learning a lot about earthquakes.
00:17:10.041,00:17:12.041,- What's that?
00:17:12.083,00:17:18.208,"It's when the ground underneath you quakes, which is also another word for shakes."
00:17:18.250,00:17:22.375,"So, earthquakes happen when the ground underneath us shakes?"
00:17:31.625,00:17:35.666,"That's probably why you've never felt it before, Splash!"
00:17:35.708,00:17:38.250,"Well, I-I guess that makes sense."
00:17:38.291,00:17:41.041,"Well, we still don't know why that happens."
00:17:41.083,00:17:43.458,"Well, I wish I could help you there, Splash."
00:17:43.500,00:17:53.708,"But I do know that earthquakes are caused by something under the ocean floor, but I've never been able to go that far down to figure out what it was."
00:17:53.750,00:18:00.125,Hm... if only we knew someone who was an expert on things that happen in the deep.
00:18:00.166,00:18:02.541,"Bubbles, what are you talking about?!"
00:18:02.583,00:18:05.750,- We know Lu!
00:18:05.791,00:18:07.375,"All right, well, thanks, Flo!"
00:18:07.416,00:18:11.291,"All right, you guys."
00:18:11.333,00:18:12.708,- Yeah!
00:18:12.750,00:18:16.291,"- Bye, Flo!"
00:18:16.333,00:18:19.208,So you kids felt it all the way up there?
00:18:19.250,00:18:22.416,'Cause we really felt it down here.
00:18:22.458,00:18:24.833,"Oh, yeah, we were shaking and shimmying."
00:18:24.875,00:18:26.666,And I'm not talking about dancing.
00:18:26.708,00:18:29.250,I'm talking about our cave!
00:18:29.291,00:18:31.416,"- Oh, are you guys okay?"
00:18:31.458,00:18:33.458,"Oh, sure."
00:18:33.500,00:18:35.208,It's just a part of nature.
00:18:35.250,00:18:37.958,Earthquakes can really make it rattle down here.
00:18:38.000,00:18:40.666,But they're an important part of our world.
00:18:40.708,00:18:43.833,Why would earthquakes be an important part of our world?
00:18:43.875,00:18:49.458,"Hmm, well, to find out, we gotta go even deeper than this, kids!"
00:18:49.500,00:18:51.208,- Ya ready?
00:18:52.458,00:18:55.083,- Whoo-hoo!
00:18:55.125,00:19:00.250,You might remember the submarine volcano?
00:19:00.291,00:19:03.541,Ah!
00:19:03.583,00:19:06.291,This place is amazing!
00:19:06.333,00:19:09.541,"Well, it wouldn't be here if not for earthquakes!"
00:19:09.583,00:19:11.291,"Wait, what?"
00:19:18.125,00:19:25.833,"Sometimes it pushes together so hard, it causes the shaking you felt earlier, which can be a little scary."
00:19:25.875,00:19:33.625,"But all that pushing also helps to make some really wonderful things, like mountains or this volcano."
00:19:33.666,00:19:35.333,"You said it, Bobby!"
00:19:35.375,00:19:42.208,All that movement underground puts pressure on the m-m-magma way down below.
00:19:42.250,00:19:46.375,When there's too much pressure... kablooey!
00:19:46.416,00:19:48.166,Eruption time!
00:19:48.208,00:19:51.166,Whoa!
00:19:56.958,00:19:58.791,"Everybody okay there, kiddos?"
00:19:58.833,00:20:00.166,- Yeah!
00:20:00.208,00:20:03.500,"How about you, Splash-aroo?"
00:20:03.541,00:20:06.416,"Actually, I'm just fine."
00:20:06.458,00:20:12.375,"Now that I know that earthquakes are just a normal part of nature, I-- well, it makes me feel better."
00:20:12.416,00:20:13.791,"Hey, thanks, Lu!"
00:20:13.833,00:20:17.625,"Ha, no problem!"
00:20:17.666,00:20:18.916,Would you look at that?
00:20:18.958,00:20:23.291,magnificent magma!
00:20:23.333,00:20:26.916,"- Sure is, Bobby."
00:20:26.958,00:20:29.708,"And then we learned that you were right, Flo!"
00:20:33.291,00:20:35.625,- What was I right about?
00:20:35.666,00:20:46.666,"That earthquakes do start underneath the earth, way underneath the earth when the ground pushes against itself and causes everything all the way up here to shake!"
00:20:46.708,00:20:49.333,Can you believe that?
00:20:49.375,00:20:52.041,"- Ahh, ahh!"
00:20:52.083,00:20:56.958,"I sure can, Dunk, because our whole planet is connected."
00:20:57.000,00:21:05.291,"The water, the air, and even the land above are all part of our one big ocean!"
00:22:27.083,00:22:28.833,I love this place.
00:22:28.875,00:22:29.833,- Whoa!
00:22:29.875,00:22:33.000,"Hey, are you okay, Splash?"
00:22:34.833,00:22:36.791,You know what?
00:22:36.833,00:22:42.000,"Well, now that I know what causes the big shakes, well, I feel much better."
00:22:42.041,00:22:47.166,that last big shake made another mountain somewhere?
00:22:47.208,00:22:52.791,Or-- or maybe a volcano!
00:22:52.833,00:22:56.791,"Ooh, so cool!"
00:22:56.833,00:22:58.500,- I'm gonna find it first!
00:01:02.291,00:01:05.208,Ha! Whoo-hoo!
00:01:05.250,00:01:06.708,Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
00:01:06.750,00:01:09.166,"- Hmm, let's see."
00:01:09.208,00:01:13.125,"Well, it looks like you're not doing anything today, so do you want to go play on the slide in Dorsal Park?"
00:01:13.166,00:01:16.000,"Uh, actually, I was kind of doing something."
00:01:16.041,00:01:17.875,- Oh.
00:01:17.916,00:01:20.291,Huh?
00:01:20.333,00:01:22.833,"Hey, this might be one of your best sand patterns ever."
00:01:22.875,00:01:24.333,"- Heya, Dunk!"
00:01:24.375,00:01:26.041,Do you want to come play on the slide?
00:01:26.083,00:01:31.000,"Uh, thanks, Bubbles, Hey, Dunk!"
00:01:31.041,00:01:36.500,"Uh, actually, I was-- Uh, guys, I--I think Dunk may just want to stay here and work on his sand art."
00:01:36.541,00:01:38.208,"Oh, okay."
00:01:38.250,00:01:40.500,"Well, you know where to find us if you want some company."
00:01:40.541,00:01:42.083,Sure do!
00:01:42.125,00:01:44.500,- Goodbye!
00:01:44.541,00:01:46.750,Peace and quiet.
00:01:46.791,00:01:50.041,on my masterpiece...
00:01:50.083,00:01:51.208,whatever that's gonna be.
00:02:22.541,00:02:24.500,Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
00:02:54.333,00:02:58.416,A little time to relax.
00:02:58.458,00:03:06.000,"No Hey, Dunk this, or Hey, Dunk that, or-- - Hey, Dunk!"
00:03:06.041,00:03:08.208,"- Hey, Mo!"
00:03:08.250,00:03:10.166,What are you doing in Reeftown?
00:03:10.208,00:03:12.916,"Oh, well, it's a funny thing."
00:03:12.958,00:03:17.541,Or more like a sunny thing.
00:03:17.583,00:03:19.916,"Mo, your side's all red!"
00:03:19.958,00:03:22.125,I'm afraid it's a sunburn.
00:03:22.166,00:03:29.833,"You know how I just love to bask in the sun on my side, but I guess I spent a little too much time doing it."
00:03:29.875,00:03:31.791,How much time were you in the sun?
00:03:31.833,00:03:34.500,Not that long.
00:03:34.541,00:03:39.000,"Oh, Mo! All day in the sun is way too much time!"
00:03:39.041,00:03:40.458,"Oh, does it hurt?"
00:03:40.500,00:03:43.500,"Oh, no, it's just sort of uncomfortable."
00:03:43.541,00:03:54.750,"But I thought my big, fearless explorer cousin Dunk would know where there might be some nice, cool water to make my sunburn feel better."
00:03:54.791,00:03:57.291,Did you say fearless explorer?
00:03:57.333,00:03:58.750,Uh-huh.
00:03:58.791,00:04:04.583,"Well, if my cousin Mo needs some cool waters, I'll take him to the coolest place I know."
00:04:04.625,00:04:08.125,"Oh, wow, I can hardly wait!"
00:04:08.166,00:04:11.166,"Yeah, let's go!"
00:04:11.208,00:04:14.083,What happened to the sun?
00:04:14.125,00:04:15.541,"Oh, sorry, Gush."
00:04:15.583,00:04:17.333,Mo and I won't be blocking your sun for long.
00:04:17.375,00:04:22.083,"We're off to the coolest place in the whole ocean, the Arctic!"
00:04:22.125,00:04:25.958,"Oh, have fun!"
00:04:36.875,00:04:40.000,Whoo! Ha!
00:04:44.916,00:04:47.291,- Whoa!
00:04:47.333,00:04:50.166,- Let's do that again!
00:04:50.208,00:04:53.791,Wow.
00:04:53.833,00:04:55.291,- What?
00:04:55.333,00:04:56.875,"Hey, hey, look at this."
00:04:56.916,00:04:59.708,Couldn't it fit right in with Dunk's collection?
00:04:59.750,00:05:02.041,"Oh, yeah, he would love it!"
00:05:02.083,00:05:09.541,"The last time he found a rock that nice, he got so excited, he puffed up, and he floated away!"
00:05:10.958,00:05:13.375,"- Oh, yeah, that was great."
00:05:13.416,00:05:15.458,Dunk is the best.
00:05:15.500,00:05:18.500,"Yeah, and then and then he did that thing!"
00:05:18.541,00:05:20.166,With the other thing!
00:05:20.208,00:05:21.958,And then that other thing happened!
00:05:22.000,00:05:25.041,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
00:05:25.083,00:05:28.500,Classic Dunk.
00:05:28.541,00:05:30.916,"Oh, I wonder what he's doing now?"
00:05:30.958,00:05:33.083,Probably just working on some sand art.
00:05:33.125,00:05:35.333,Too bad he's missing out on all the fun.
00:05:35.375,00:05:38.583,"Well, if we're missing him, maybe he's missing us, too?"
00:05:38.625,00:05:40.791,Only one way to find out!
00:05:40.833,00:05:43.250,"- Come on, let's go!"
00:05:43.291,00:05:47.625,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:05:47.666,00:05:49.291,"Oh, my! You were right."
00:05:49.333,00:05:56.125,"This is the coolest place Welcome to the Arctic, Mo."
00:05:56.166,00:06:02.625,"If cool waters'll make your sunburn feel better, this ice-cold water should make it feel great!"
00:06:02.666,00:06:04.916,"Oh, you're right, cuz."
00:06:04.958,00:06:07.791,I can barely feel my sunburn anymore!
00:06:07.833,00:06:15.000,"Also, I can barely feel - Is that bad?"
00:06:15.041,00:06:17.750,"Hey, where are all your friends?"
00:06:17.791,00:06:20.458,Don't they usually come with you on adventures?
00:06:20.500,00:06:22.750,"Yeah, they're off playing today."
00:06:22.791,00:06:25.583,I wonder what they're doing right now.
00:06:25.625,00:06:29.208,Maybe playing finball?
00:06:29.250,00:06:30.958,"- Hey, Mo!"
00:06:31.000,00:06:34.500,- Want to play a game?
00:06:34.541,00:06:37.625,Ha! Aww.
00:06:37.666,00:06:40.125,No pebbles around.
00:06:43.416,00:06:45.583,It's called iceball.
00:06:45.625,00:06:47.166,- Ooh.
00:06:47.208,00:06:48.750,- I'll hit it to you...
00:06:48.791,00:06:50.041,And then you can hit it back to me.
00:06:50.083,00:06:52.708,- Got it!
00:06:52.750,00:06:54.791,Ah.
00:06:57.750,00:07:02.666,Aww. I only missed because warm water fish move slower in cold water.
00:07:02.708,00:07:05.875,"- That, and ice floats."
00:07:05.916,00:07:08.625,"So, uh..."
00:07:08.666,00:07:11.041,- what should we do now?
00:07:11.083,00:07:15.583,Maybe you could use a few minutes at the surface in the sun to warm you up.
00:07:15.625,00:07:18.333,"Uh, just a few minutes should be okay."
00:07:18.375,00:07:21.791,I can warm myself up on my non-sunburned side.
00:07:21.833,00:07:23.000,"Great idea, Mo."
00:07:23.041,00:07:26.875,Great ideas run in our family.
00:07:26.916,00:07:28.666,Almost there.
00:07:30.083,00:07:32.625,You did it!
00:07:32.666,00:07:35.250,"Uh, sorry, Dunk."
00:07:35.291,00:07:38.291,I seem to have run into something on the surface.
00:07:38.333,00:07:40.000,"Oh, right."
00:07:40.041,00:07:42.625,The surface is covered in sea ice!
00:07:42.666,00:07:45.916,Which makes for a very nice back scratcher.
00:07:49.291,00:07:51.458,I have a friend in the Arctic who can help us.
00:07:51.500,00:07:53.416,Whistler the narwhal!
00:07:53.458,00:07:57.250,Now I just got to figure out how to whistle so I can call him.
00:07:59.875,00:08:03.500,"Okay, that was just practice."
00:08:06.875,00:08:12.000,I'm the king of the whistle!
00:08:13.958,00:08:17.500,Huh?
00:08:17.541,00:08:19.125,"- Hey, cool moves, Dunk!"
00:08:19.166,00:08:22.083,"Splash, Bubbles, Ripple!"
00:08:22.125,00:08:24.291,I'm so glad you're here.
00:08:24.333,00:08:26.916,"- Uh, how'd you find us?"
00:08:26.958,00:08:29.750,Gush told us that you and Mo were headed to the Arctic.
00:08:29.791,00:08:32.875,all the way up here?
00:08:32.916,00:08:35.166,Are you kidding?
00:08:35.208,00:08:38.541,We would travel to the end of the Earth to see you.
00:08:38.583,00:08:40.833,And we just did.
00:08:42.833,00:08:45.083,We never like to miss out on an adventure.
00:08:45.125,00:08:47.458,"But, uh, what are you doing here?"
00:08:47.500,00:08:54.125,"We're here to cool my sunburn, and it's working almost too well, because now I'm freezing."
00:08:54.166,00:08:58.750,"Yeah, so now we're trying to get Mo into the sun to warm up a bit."
00:08:58.791,00:09:04.416,"I was trying to call Whistler by whistling like he does, but then you guys did it for me!"
00:09:04.458,00:09:06.666,"But wait, Dunk."
00:09:09.041,00:09:11.708,"- Hey, Whistler!"
00:09:11.750,00:09:13.625,"Hey, there, friends."
00:09:13.666,00:09:15.541,"What's happening, huh?"
00:09:15.583,00:09:16.916,"Hey, Mo!"
00:09:16.958,00:09:19.958,"This is my friend, Whistler the narwhal!"
00:09:20.000,00:09:23.791,"Whistler, this is my cousin, Mo the sunfish!"
00:09:23.833,00:09:25.750,"Pleasure to meet you, Whistler."
00:09:25.791,00:09:28.375,- Likewise!
00:09:25.791,00:09:30.208,"- Uh, Whistler, we need to get through the ice to the surface."
00:09:32.791,00:09:36.333,"I am a narwhal, after all."
00:09:36.375,00:09:39.625,"Swim back, everybody!"
00:09:39.666,00:09:41.416,- Okay!
00:09:50.041,00:09:54.291,That was amazing!
00:09:55.916,00:09:59.000,"- Go for it, Mo."
00:09:59.041,00:10:02.458,"Ooh, oh. Ah!"
00:10:06.416,00:10:10.083,Oh....
00:10:10.125,00:10:13.000,It feels even colder here at the surface.
00:10:13.041,00:10:16.291,"I think your sun is broken, Whistler."
00:10:16.333,00:10:21.083,"Oh, the surface of the Arctic is even colder than the water below."
00:10:21.125,00:10:24.708,"If you're looking for warmth, you'll have to head back down south."
00:10:24.750,00:10:28.208,"Oh, well, thanks for your help, Whistler."
00:10:28.250,00:10:32.375,"- Any time, friends! See ya!"
00:10:32.416,00:10:33.750,"- Bye, Whistler!"
00:10:33.791,00:10:35.000,- Thanks for the help.
00:10:35.041,00:10:36.958,"- Good-bye, Whistler."
00:10:35.041,00:10:41.875,"- Aww, I didn't realize the surface temperature in the Arctic was just as cold as the water."
00:10:41.916,00:10:43.791,"Oh, it's okay."
00:10:43.833,00:10:49.791,"As long as I stay out of the sun for a while, I'll be as good as new in no time."
00:10:49.833,00:10:53.583,I'm just not cut out for all this c-c-cold water.
00:10:53.625,00:10:58.833,I belong where the water and the sun are warm.
00:10:58.875,00:11:00.708,"Sorry, Mo."
00:11:00.750,00:11:03.250,I just wanted to make your sunburn feel better.
00:11:03.291,00:11:06.916,Some fearless explorer I turned out to be.
00:11:06.958,00:11:08.666,Are you kidding?
00:11:08.708,00:11:17.208,"Because of you, I rode the currents, explored the frozen Arctic, and met a narwhal!"
00:11:17.250,00:11:21.250,"If you're not a fearless explorer, I don't know who is!"
00:11:21.291,00:11:23.750,Sounds like an explorer to me!
00:11:23.791,00:11:26.958,Wow!
00:11:27.000,00:11:30.583,I only wish you guys had been here the whole time.
00:11:30.625,00:11:32.500,You make everything more fun!
00:11:32.541,00:11:35.375,"Well, we feel the same way, buddy."
00:11:35.416,00:11:38.875,"Oh, that was just the sweetest."
00:11:38.916,00:11:43.416,"I would cry right now, but my tears are frozen."
00:11:43.458,00:11:46.291,"Come on, Reeftown Rangers!"
00:11:46.333,00:11:50.916,"Let's get Mo back to the current, and let's get us all back home!"
00:11:50.958,00:11:53.333,And you know what the best part is?
00:11:53.375,00:11:55.791,- We'll all go back together.
00:12:02.125,00:12:05.041,"Okay, okay, okay."
00:12:05.083,00:12:06.291,"- Okay, okay."
00:12:06.333,00:12:10.000,I can fit into small places.
00:12:10.041,00:12:12.375,I shoot ink at predators.
00:12:12.416,00:12:14.875,- Ah!
00:12:14.916,00:12:16.625,Ah? Ah?
00:12:18.500,00:12:19.625,- Octopus!
00:12:19.666,00:12:21.708,- Mayor Sting!
00:12:21.750,00:12:24.041,Right! I'm an octopus.
00:12:24.083,00:12:26.125,"Oh, octopus."
00:12:26.166,00:12:28.791,"I love playing imagin-ocean, don't you?"
00:12:28.833,00:12:33.833,Yeah! Playing a game and using my imagination-- two of my favorite things ever.
00:12:33.875,00:12:36.416,"Me too, Splash."
00:12:36.458,00:12:38.750,My turn!
00:12:38.791,00:12:40.291,I have a shell.
00:12:40.333,00:12:42.291,But I can swim fast.
00:12:44.875,00:12:50.750,"I love warm water, and I go on long migrations."
00:12:50.791,00:12:53.208,- Yeah!
00:12:53.250,00:12:56.458,A sea turtle?
00:12:56.500,00:12:57.666,You're a seahorse.
00:12:57.708,00:12:59.916,"- Hey, it's Finny."
00:12:59.958,00:13:02.708,We were just playing imagin-ocean.
00:13:02.750,00:13:03.958,"Yeah, you want to play?"
00:13:04.000,00:13:06.833,"Uh, what's imagine an ocean?"
00:13:06.875,00:13:10.166,It's that game where we pretend - to be other creatures.
00:13:10.208,00:13:11.791,I guess you never played before.
00:13:13.208,00:13:14.791,It's really easy and so much fun.
00:13:14.833,00:13:16.750,"Okay, I'll give it a try."
00:13:16.791,00:13:20.166,"Okay, well, first, you pretend that you're another fish."
00:13:22.791,00:13:24.958,Just think and imagine.
00:13:25.000,00:13:28.875,and we'll guess what you are!
00:13:28.916,00:13:33.000,"Hmm, uh, just one question."
00:13:33.041,00:13:38.333,How can I pretend to be another fish when I am a mandarin dragonet?
00:13:38.375,00:13:41.291,I don't think Finny gets how to play imagin-ocean.
00:13:41.333,00:13:46.875,"Yeah, but, uh, maybe if you describe to Finny how you can pretend to be another creature, it'll help?"
00:13:46.916,00:13:48.250,- Yeah.
00:13:48.291,00:13:49.791,"Okay, okay."
00:13:49.833,00:13:52.500,"Okey-dokey, I got one."
00:13:52.541,00:13:54.250,Okay.
00:13:54.291,00:13:56.791,"- Hi, everybody!"
00:13:58.500,00:14:00.791,I have lots and lots of tentacles.
00:14:00.833,00:14:05.750,"But don't get too close to my tentacles, because I can sting!"
00:14:05.791,00:14:08.833,- Yah! Yah!
00:14:08.875,00:14:09.875,What am I?
00:14:09.916,00:14:12.833,You're Bubbles!
00:14:12.875,00:14:18.166,Uh... but who is Bubbles pretending to be?
00:14:18.208,00:14:20.833,I'm squishy?
00:14:20.875,00:14:23.500,Huh-huh?
00:14:23.541,00:14:28.250,I'm pretending to be Oh.
00:14:28.291,00:14:32.125,"Well, you definitely described a jellyfish."
00:14:32.166,00:14:34.583,But you still look like Bubbles.
00:14:34.625,00:14:38.250,"Yeah, but, uh, describing is part of imagining."
00:14:38.291,00:14:40.000,- Oh.
00:14:40.041,00:14:43.416,Why don't you pick a creature and describe it to us?
00:14:43.458,00:14:46.083,And pretend to be it so we can all guess what you are.
00:14:46.125,00:14:47.500,- Yeah.
00:14:47.541,00:14:49.166,Um...let's see.
00:14:49.208,00:14:50.625,"Uh, hello."
00:14:50.666,00:14:53.541,"Uh, I am green and purple."
00:14:53.583,00:14:56.708,"And I have, uh, eyes on my face."
00:14:56.750,00:15:00.375,"And, uh, I move my fins really fast like this."
00:15:00.416,00:15:02.000,What am I?
00:15:02.041,00:15:04.208,"Finny, are you describing a mandarin dragonet?"
00:15:04.250,00:15:07.083,- Yeah.
00:15:07.125,00:15:11.416,"Good job, Bubbles!"
00:15:11.458,00:15:18.833,"Well, isn't there any other sea creature you'd want to be, something you like very much?"
00:15:18.875,00:15:22.625,I. Love. Fin whales!
00:15:22.666,00:15:25.166,I love them so much!
00:15:25.208,00:15:27.416,Sometimes I wish I could be one!
00:15:27.458,00:15:29.791,Why do you want to be a fin whale?
00:15:29.833,00:15:31.458,What's so cool about them?
00:15:31.500,00:15:35.208,"Well, let me start with..."
00:15:38.833,00:15:40.875,Only the blue whale is longer!
00:15:40.916,00:15:42.083,"Cool, right?"
00:15:42.125,00:15:43.791,- Yeah.
00:15:43.833,00:15:47.791,Fin whales are also called finback or razorback whales.
00:15:47.833,00:15:51.125,Love that. So cool!
00:15:51.166,00:15:53.166,And fin whales breathe air!
00:15:53.208,00:15:58.125,So they have to go to the surface way up there to breathe every few minutes!
00:15:58.166,00:15:59.375,How cool is that?
00:15:59.416,00:16:01.125,- Really cool.
00:16:01.166,00:16:08.583,"So, Finny, um, just pretending, if you were a fin whale, what would you do, and how would you move?"
00:16:11.916,00:16:14.250,Like this.
00:16:14.291,00:16:17.625,- Whoa.
00:16:17.666,00:16:19.166,And I'm very large.
00:16:19.208,00:16:22.833,But you can call me a finback or razorback.
00:16:22.875,00:16:27.041,"Oh, wow, she's doing it!"
00:16:28.250,00:16:29.583,- Oh.
00:16:29.625,00:16:31.541,- Know what I'm doing now?
00:16:31.583,00:16:33.250,- I'm eating!
00:16:33.291,00:16:36.791,Did you know that we fin whales don't have teeth?
00:16:36.833,00:16:40.333,No way!
00:16:40.375,00:16:44.750,That's right!
00:16:44.791,00:16:46.541,"Oh, what's baleen?"
00:16:46.583,00:16:54.166,"Oh, well, fin whales are filter feeders, and baleen is a filter to strain food through bristles in their mouths!"
00:16:54.208,00:16:55.500,- Whoa.
00:16:59.833,00:17:03.458,"Oh, well, uh-- of course!"
00:17:03.500,00:17:06.958,- Let's go through Reeftown!
00:17:07.000,00:17:11.416,I bet everyone else will be surprised to see a fin whale there!
00:17:11.458,00:17:12.875,- Yeah!
00:17:12.916,00:17:14.500,"- Come on, Finny the fin whale!"
00:17:14.541,00:17:17.375,- Follow the whale!
00:17:17.416,00:17:19.583,"- Hi, Mr. Mayor!"
00:17:19.625,00:17:25.166,This is our new friend Finny!
00:17:25.208,00:17:30.250,"Nice to meet another fine citizen of Reeftown, whatever the size."
00:17:30.291,00:17:32.666,Enjoy our wonderful watery day!
00:17:32.708,00:17:36.708,"- Thank you, Mayor!"
00:17:36.750,00:17:40.208,Make way for Finny the fin whale!
00:17:40.250,00:17:42.333,- Yeah!
00:17:42.375,00:17:46.958,And this is Pebble Place.
00:17:47.000,00:17:49.750,Great place to hang with friends like us!
00:17:49.791,00:17:53.583,"Hmm, Pebble Place."
00:17:57.625,00:18:00.041,Second-longest!
00:18:00.083,00:18:03.083,I don't think there's room enough for me in this area.
00:18:03.125,00:18:07.625,"Well, I know the perfect roomier place for a big whale, follow me!"
00:18:07.666,00:18:09.291,- Ooh.
00:18:09.333,00:18:12.666,Welcome to Take-Off Point!
00:18:12.708,00:18:14.916,"Now, this area's roomy!"
00:18:14.958,00:18:18.125,"Plus, you can see the whole ocean from here!"
00:18:22.708,00:18:25.791,"Oh, yes, I absolutely have."
00:18:29.375,00:18:32.708,"Watch out, I'm huge!"
00:18:32.750,00:18:36.166,Where'd Finny go?
00:18:36.208,00:18:38.875,Maybe she's hiding.
00:18:43.875,00:18:45.958,She's using her imagination pretty well.
00:18:46.000,00:18:49.750,I think she must have gone up to the surface to breathe like a real fin whale.
00:18:49.791,00:18:51.708,- Finny!
00:18:51.750,00:18:53.125,- Where'd you go?
00:18:53.166,00:18:54.125,Where are you?
00:18:55.791,00:18:57.208,- Oh.
00:18:57.250,00:18:58.541,- Uh...
00:18:58.583,00:19:01.500,- I think she's back?
00:19:06.583,00:19:08.458,I'm so happy to see you all.
00:19:08.500,00:19:12.208,"Now tell me, who is this Finny that you mixed me up with?"
00:19:12.250,00:19:15.708,"Another big, gorgeous fin whale?"
00:19:15.750,00:19:19.250,"Guys, I love being a fin whale."
00:19:19.291,00:19:24.416,It's the-- I don't see the resemblance.
00:19:24.458,00:19:30.291,"Is that a f-- are you a f-- Yup. Uh, Finny, this is our friend Melody!"
00:19:30.333,00:19:32.041,"Hi, Finny."
00:19:33.791,00:19:36.833,You're a-- you're a fin whale!
00:19:36.875,00:19:38.583,I sure am.
00:19:38.625,00:19:41.750,"Always have been, always will be."
00:19:46.833,00:19:49.958,Fin whales use a baleen system to strain food in their mouths!
00:19:50.000,00:19:52.750,And you're the second-longest creature in the ocean.
00:19:52.791,00:19:55.875,A-and fin-- fin whales migrate all over the world!
00:19:59.791,00:20:01.791,- I'm flattered.
00:20:06.125,00:20:08.958,"And I'd like to learn about you, too, Finny!"
00:20:09.000,00:20:11.250,You're quite the fin whale expert.
00:20:11.291,00:20:12.958,"Thanks, Melody!"
00:20:13.000,00:20:15.500,Who knew you two would be such great friends!
00:20:15.541,00:20:17.125,"- Yeah, who knew!"
00:21:53.125,00:21:57.166,"I wish I could talk more, but I'm just passing through."
00:21:57.208,00:22:00.750,I'm actually off right now to go see my family.
00:22:00.791,00:22:02.333,- Wow!
00:22:02.375,00:22:04.458,- That's so neat!
00:22:02.375,00:22:07.833,- I can hardly imagine what a whole fin whale family would look like.
00:22:07.875,00:22:11.041,"So many big, cool fin whales."
00:22:17.000,00:22:20.541,You can see them with your own two eyes.
00:22:20.583,00:22:23.083,- I can?
00:22:20.583,00:22:25.333,"- Yes, you can, if you come with me to meet them."
00:22:25.375,00:22:26.625,Want to go?
00:22:26.666,00:22:29.750,"Yes, yes, yes!"
00:22:29.791,00:22:32.333,"Uh, wait."
00:22:32.375,00:22:34.500,"This isn't some pretend game, is it?"
00:22:34.541,00:22:37.416,"- Oh, it's real."
00:22:37.458,00:22:39.166,- The real deal.
00:22:39.208,00:22:41.958,"- You're serious, Melody?"
00:22:42.000,00:22:45.291,- But let's get a move-on.
00:22:45.333,00:22:47.500,"Yeah, come back and tell us everything!"
00:22:47.541,00:22:51.791,I will!
00:22:51.833,00:22:54.208,I'll have her back before dinner.
00:22:54.250,00:22:58.666,- Bye-bye!
00:01:04.041,00:01:11.833,"And here we are in Pebble Place, where I live with my friends Splash, Dunk, and Ripple."
00:01:11.875,00:01:13.958,Isn't it nice?
00:01:14.000,00:01:16.958,I'm glad you like it.
00:01:17.000,00:01:23.541,"Now, let me show you Uh, hey, guys, uh, is Bubbles talking to someone?"
00:01:23.583,00:01:27.541,"Yeah, but who?"
00:01:27.583,00:01:29.583,Yeah. Me either.
00:01:29.625,00:01:31.500,"Uh, come on."
00:01:31.541,00:01:35.541,Ta-da!
00:01:35.583,00:01:41.375,Except you still have to meet my friends and-- - Hi.
00:01:41.416,00:01:46.416,"Splash, Dunk, Ripple?"
00:01:46.458,00:01:50.083,"- Uhh, hi."
00:01:52.625,00:01:54.625,But she's very friendly.
00:01:54.666,00:01:58.500,"Uh, I'm sure she is-- Oh, oh, Dunk!"
00:01:58.541,00:02:00.083,- Huh?
00:02:00.125,00:02:03.208,"Uh, are you okay, Nan?"
00:02:03.250,00:02:05.291,"Oh, heh."
00:02:05.333,00:02:08.333,"Uh, where exactly is Nan?"
00:02:08.375,00:02:10.291,"Just, you know, so we don't bump her."
00:02:10.333,00:02:14.291,"Well, she's-- she's right here."
00:02:14.333,00:02:15.791,There?
00:02:15.833,00:02:18.125,"Well, yeah."
00:02:20.291,00:02:22.708,"Anyway, isn't she something?"
00:02:22.750,00:02:26.583,"Ah, she is something."
00:02:26.625,00:02:29.791,"The question is, uh, what?"
00:02:29.833,00:02:33.750,"Oh, she's nanoplankton."
00:02:33.791,00:02:38.208,Do you get it? Nan!
00:02:42.000,00:02:43.333,"No, no, no, I'm sorry."
00:02:43.375,00:02:46.166,I have to admit I don't see anyone.
00:02:46.208,00:02:50.000,None of us can.
00:02:50.041,00:02:52.083,What's nanoplankton again?
00:02:52.125,00:03:01.000,"Oh, nanoplankton is all this living stuff floating around in the ocean that is too small for us to see."
00:03:01.041,00:03:03.458,Flo told me about it.
00:03:03.500,00:03:05.708,So let me get this straight.
00:03:07.916,00:03:09.333,Yes?
00:03:09.375,00:03:12.375,Who's too small for any of us to see...
00:03:13.916,00:03:19.416,Is one of the millions of tiny creatures floating around the ocean called nanoplankton?
00:03:21.250,00:03:24.500,I knew you guys would understand.
00:03:24.541,00:03:30.958,"Well, to be completely honest, I-I don't understand yet, but, well, if Nan is a friend of yours, she's a friend of mine, too."
00:03:31.000,00:03:33.833,- Me too.
00:03:33.875,00:03:36.541,"Ha, ha!"
00:03:36.583,00:03:37.875,You can hang with us.
00:03:51.041,00:03:55.333,"I'm Splash, a fusilier."
00:03:55.375,00:03:58.916,I'm going global.
00:03:58.958,00:04:02.416,"Bubbles, that's me!"
00:04:02.458,00:04:04.416,Do I like stuff that's gross and gooey?
00:04:04.458,00:04:06.083,You bet!
00:04:13.250,00:04:16.833,I'm the artist known as Dunk.
00:04:21.041,00:04:22.458,"Ripple, I'm a seahorse."
00:04:51.500,00:04:54.166,"It really means a lot to me, you being so nice to Nan."
00:04:55.333,00:04:57.208,Now let's go play.
00:05:00.083,00:05:01.500,- Ooh!
00:05:01.541,00:05:02.875,- I do!
00:05:04.833,00:05:06.458,Wha-- oh.
00:05:06.500,00:05:08.958,"Okay, um..."
00:05:09.000,00:05:11.083,"Um, somewhere."
00:05:14.000,00:05:17.041,Whoooo-haa!
00:05:18.166,00:05:20.000,Whoa!
00:05:20.041,00:05:22.875,Whoaaa!
00:05:22.916,00:05:25.791,Yeah!
00:05:25.833,00:05:26.958,Whoa!
00:05:28.833,00:05:32.791,Whoa-ohh-ohh!
00:05:32.833,00:05:34.041,Guess who's here?
00:05:34.083,00:05:36.208,Splash the fusilier!
00:05:36.250,00:05:38.250,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:05:38.291,00:05:40.333,Whoa-ohh-ohh!
00:05:40.375,00:05:42.250,"Aw, yeah."
00:05:42.291,00:05:45.625,"Oh, wait!"
00:05:45.666,00:05:47.416,Oh. Okay.
00:05:47.458,00:05:49.041,Go ahead.
00:05:49.083,00:05:51.375,"Okay, come on down, Nan."
00:05:51.416,00:05:53.875,- Uh...
00:05:53.916,00:05:56.000,Get ready for Dunk's Slide Supreme!
00:05:56.041,00:05:58.958,"Wait, no, no, Dunk."
00:05:59.000,00:06:03.000,"Um, maybe you can say something encouraging to her?"
00:06:03.041,00:06:06.125,"Uh, go ahead, Nan."
00:06:10.041,00:06:11.625,Um...
00:06:11.666,00:06:17.375,"I know you're really little and this slide is big, but you're a tough, brave nanoplankton, right?"
00:06:17.416,00:06:19.208,"Aw, that was nice of him."
00:06:21.000,00:06:23.708,Uh...
00:06:23.750,00:06:25.375,"Uh, uh, yep!"
00:06:25.416,00:06:27.875,She's coming!
00:06:27.916,00:06:28.916,"Okay, sure, yeah."
00:06:33.208,00:06:35.000,All right!
00:06:35.041,00:06:37.416,Is it my turn now?
00:06:42.166,00:06:44.166,"- Follow me, everybody!"
00:06:44.208,00:06:45.833,"We are right behind you, Splash!"
00:06:45.875,00:06:48.375,"Oh, boy."
00:06:48.416,00:06:50.083,Now swim like this!
00:06:52.666,00:06:54.583,"Glide, glide!"
00:06:56.500,00:06:58.416,"Oh, you guys are good at that."
00:06:58.458,00:07:01.083,"Okay, now it's Nan's turn to be leader."
00:07:01.125,00:07:03.125,Okay?
00:07:03.166,00:07:04.250,Um...
00:07:04.291,00:07:05.791,All ready?
00:07:05.833,00:07:06.875,"Okay, and go!"
00:07:08.666,00:07:11.666,"You guys, she's over here!"
00:07:14.833,00:07:16.333,"Wait, nope."
00:07:16.375,00:07:18.666,"- Oh, down there."
00:07:18.708,00:07:20.000,Where?
00:07:20.041,00:07:21.750,"Oh, wait, she's right here!"
00:07:21.791,00:07:24.458,"No, she was, really?"
00:07:24.500,00:07:27.291,I think I see her.
00:07:27.333,00:07:30.000,"Oh, gosh, Nan, they keep swimming in the wrong direction."
00:07:30.041,00:07:31.958,Isn't that funny?
00:07:32.000,00:07:34.958,- I'm not-- - this is impossible!
00:07:35.000,00:07:38.791,"Uh, hide and seek?"
00:07:38.833,00:07:42.666,Why not?
00:07:42.708,00:07:44.291,"Okay, we'll try."
00:07:44.333,00:07:46.708,"- Did you hear that, Nan?"
00:07:48.833,00:07:51.958,"Well, we found everyone."
00:07:52.000,00:07:53.916,Except Nan.
00:07:53.958,00:07:55.375,- Yeah.
00:07:55.416,00:07:58.791,I don't know.
00:08:00.250,00:08:03.208,She's not there.
00:08:04.500,00:08:08.333,"Let's see, uh-- oh!"
00:08:08.375,00:08:09.791,"Ah, nope."
00:08:09.833,00:08:13.708,"Okay, uh, well, uh, There she is!"
00:08:13.750,00:08:15.125,- Oh!
00:08:15.166,00:08:17.625,"Silly, she's right here."
00:08:17.666,00:08:21.541,Wha-- has she been there the whole time?
00:08:21.583,00:08:22.875,You betcha.
00:08:22.916,00:08:24.833,I just don't get it.
00:08:24.875,00:08:27.166,Playing with nanoplankton is hard.
00:08:27.208,00:08:28.375,Mm-hmm.
00:08:28.416,00:08:30.250,"Hey, maybe Flo will help us understand."
00:08:30.291,00:08:32.125,- Let's go find her.
00:08:36.375,00:08:40.750,"Ah, well, she's gotta be around here somewhere, - Flo?"
00:08:40.791,00:08:41.833,"Oh, there she is."
00:08:44.750,00:08:46.125,"Hi, kids."
00:08:46.166,00:08:48.666,- What can I do for you?
00:08:48.708,00:08:53.416,"Well, I was hoping you can help everyone understand about my friend Nan."
00:08:57.041,00:08:59.125,"Ah, yes, that can be a challenge."
00:08:59.166,00:09:04.333,"Well, we were kind of wondering, uh, is she real, or is she pretend?"
00:09:04.375,00:09:07.666,Ha!
00:09:04.375,00:09:11.333,"Not only is Nan real, but nanoplankton is all around us."
00:09:11.375,00:09:16.541,"There is a whole world in every drop of water, in fact."
00:09:16.583,00:09:19.625,"And why can't we see them, again?"
00:09:19.666,00:09:22.125,It's because we're so much bigger.
00:09:22.166,00:09:36.750,"Now, if we were to shrink ourselves really, really tiny, we could see nanoplankton, and all kinds of tiny creatures and plants, all around us."
00:09:39.333,00:09:44.458,Imagining other creatures and how they might feel is very important.
00:09:44.500,00:09:48.916,And that's what Bubbles is doing by being friends with Nan.
00:09:48.958,00:09:52.708,"Wow, I never thought of it that way."
00:09:52.750,00:09:56.125,"Friendship isn't about size anyway, right, guys?"
00:09:56.166,00:09:57.750,- Right.
00:10:02.041,00:10:04.375,- Yeah!
00:10:27.541,00:10:29.375,So much to see!
00:10:41.958,00:10:45.541,"Yeah. Hey-- hey, Nan?"
00:10:45.583,00:10:50.333,"Uh, Bubbles, you know, it's really okay if you're just pretending you can see Nan."
00:10:50.375,00:10:52.708,We-- we know none of us can ever see her.
00:10:52.750,00:10:56.375,"She's not here, but I know she's here somewhere."
00:10:56.416,00:11:00.375,"But if you can't see her, how do you know?"
00:11:00.416,00:11:05.083,"Well, because I can just feel it."
00:11:05.125,00:11:08.083,"Well, maybe she left."
00:11:08.125,00:11:10.625,"No, she wouldn't have left without saying goodbye."
00:11:10.666,00:11:13.291,"Well, I wish we could help you look for her."
00:11:22.500,00:11:24.541,"You can't really see nanoplankton, right?"
00:11:24.583,00:11:27.583,I see her!
00:11:27.625,00:11:30.625,"Really and truly, I see Nan."
00:11:30.666,00:11:33.041,Wha-- that dot of light is Nan?
00:11:33.083,00:11:36.958,"Mm-hmm, yeah."
00:11:33.083,00:11:39.333,She must be bioluminescent 'cause she can light up in the dark.
00:11:39.375,00:11:41.583,So we can see her in this dark cave.
00:11:41.625,00:11:45.041,"Wow, she's small, but she sure does shine."
00:11:45.083,00:11:47.916,"Oh, it's great to finally see you, Nan."
00:11:50.958,00:11:53.750,I knew it all along.
00:11:53.791,00:11:55.958,- Yeah.
00:11:56.000,00:11:57.875,"Aw, Nan."
00:11:57.916,00:11:59.958,Aww.
00:12:06.333,00:12:12.208,"Aww, I tell ya, a place for everything, and everything in its place."
00:12:12.250,00:12:17.750,"Ahh, Tidy, old boy, you've got it all figured out."
00:13:00.875,00:13:25.041,"as you found it Keep it clean, I'm begging you."
00:13:25.083,00:13:26.375,Ah.
00:13:26.416,00:13:28.208,"Oh, this please is a mess."
00:13:28.250,00:13:31.083,reporting for fun!
00:13:31.125,00:13:34.416,Reeftown Rangers.
00:13:36.208,00:13:39.666,"Is everything okay, Tidy?"
00:13:39.708,00:13:41.708,"Ha, ha!"
00:13:41.750,00:13:43.833,"Welcoming you to the kelp forest, that's it."
00:13:43.875,00:13:48.208,"Uh, yes, but usually you remind us to wipe our fins first."
00:13:48.250,00:13:51.708,And to keep our pebbles and shells off the algae bed.
00:13:51.750,00:13:54.333,"Yeah, and to have a tidy day."
00:13:54.375,00:13:59.458,"Well, today I have something else on my mind!"
00:14:02.500,00:14:05.083,"Well, since you're all bursting to know, I'll tell you."
00:14:05.125,00:14:08.458,I've decided that I'm ready to find...
00:14:08.500,00:14:10.458,Mrs. Tidy.
00:14:10.500,00:14:13.125,- Huh? Huh?
00:14:13.166,00:14:15.083,"Yeah, that's right!"
00:14:15.125,00:14:17.208,"Well, who's Mrs. Tidy?"
00:14:17.250,00:14:20.041,"Well, uh, I don't know yet."
00:14:20.083,00:14:22.541,"But, uh, that's exactly what we're gonna find out."
00:14:22.583,00:14:23.875,When is she coming?
00:14:23.916,00:14:27.791,"Well, you don't just find Mrs. Tidy under any kelp leaf in the forest."
00:14:31.250,00:14:33.458,"Oh, well, how do you get ready?"
00:14:33.500,00:14:35.541,"Well, lots of ways."
00:14:35.583,00:14:37.083,"Take this algae bed, for instance."
00:14:37.125,00:14:41.458,Have you guys ever wondered why I keep it so clean and tend to all this red algae?
00:14:41.500,00:14:45.416,"Well, we thought maybe you really, really, really liked to clean."
00:14:45.458,00:14:48.833,"Yeah, and you really, really, really like red algae."
00:14:48.875,00:14:51.125,"Well, good guesses, kids."
00:14:51.166,00:14:52.750,But there's another reason.
00:14:52.791,00:14:57.166,It's to create a place for a female garibaldi fish.
00:14:57.208,00:15:01.125,"But Tidy, why do female garibaldi fish - like these things?"
00:15:07.125,00:15:09.375,How will you find her?
00:15:09.416,00:15:10.791,"Mm, there's no easy answer."
00:15:10.833,00:15:16.250,"We're gonna need some hope, some faith, and some of these moves."
00:15:16.291,00:15:18.625,Watch this! Whoa-ho!
00:15:18.666,00:15:21.375,"Ooh, wow!"
00:15:21.416,00:15:23.916,Yeah!
00:15:23.958,00:15:26.583,Why are you swimming like that?
00:15:26.625,00:15:27.750,"Oh, you mean these moves?"
00:15:27.791,00:15:32.541,"Well, that's how I signal to the future Mrs. Tidy that I'm here."
00:15:32.583,00:15:34.875,So she's gonna see you?
00:15:34.916,00:15:38.333,That's the idea!
00:15:38.375,00:15:40.500,But what if she's too far away?
00:15:40.541,00:15:42.833,can't see the algae bed?
00:15:42.875,00:15:46.833,"Well, then I guess I'll just have to keep swimming like this forever."
00:15:48.166,00:15:50.833,I'm kidding.
00:15:52.958,00:15:55.375,"Oh boy, you got us there, Tidy."
00:15:55.416,00:15:59.458,She'll find me.
00:16:00.958,00:16:03.041,"Oh, we have to help Tidy."
00:16:03.083,00:16:06.750,Hmm? He'll be okay.
00:16:06.791,00:16:10.500,But his plan is just to clean the algae bed and swim like that.
00:16:10.541,00:16:14.875,"If he doesn't find Mrs. Tidy, he'll be doing all that cleaning for nothing."
00:16:14.916,00:16:17.958,That's true.
00:16:18.000,00:16:19.958,What do you think we should do?
00:16:20.000,00:16:23.833,Here's the plan.
00:16:23.875,00:16:26.500,We're gonna help look for Mrs. Tidy.
00:16:26.541,00:16:29.750,- But how?
00:16:29.791,00:16:32.833,"Yeah, we don't know anything about her."
00:16:32.875,00:16:35.250,"Well, we do know a bit."
00:16:35.291,00:16:38.833,We know Mrs. Tidy is someone who likes clean algae beds.
00:16:38.875,00:16:41.916,"Right, and, uh, red algae."
00:16:41.958,00:16:45.041,"Oh, and orange fish who swim like that."
00:16:45.083,00:16:46.500,Uh... uh.
00:16:46.541,00:16:48.125,You're right!
00:16:48.166,00:16:50.958,We do know what we're looking for.
00:16:51.000,00:16:56.583,"Yeah, and after all, don't they always say there's plenty of fish in the sea?"
00:16:56.625,00:16:59.208,- Yeah!
00:16:59.250,00:17:06.291,"Oh, kids, that is so nice of you to want to help, but not just any fish can be Mrs. Tidy."
00:17:06.333,00:17:08.708,"Hey, I have an idea."
00:17:12.083,00:17:14.166,"Well, uh, okay."
00:17:17.125,00:17:19.541,"Okay, Bubbles, what's your great idea?"
00:17:19.583,00:17:22.291,Someone who understands hard work like Tidy.
00:17:22.333,00:17:24.458,- Mm-hmm.
00:17:24.500,00:17:30.000,"And-- oh, and this is a big one- someone who understands cleaning as much as Tidy."
00:17:30.041,00:17:32.333,- And who would that be?
00:17:32.375,00:17:34.291,Ta-da!
00:17:34.333,00:17:36.458,Huh?
00:17:39.875,00:17:41.875,Chompy?
00:17:41.916,00:17:44.666,What does Chompy do all day?
00:17:44.708,00:17:46.541,"Uh, chomp coral?"
00:17:46.583,00:17:49.125,Wait a minute.
00:17:49.166,00:17:53.083,"She's not just chomping it, she's cleaning it."
00:17:53.125,00:17:56.500,"Wow, you're right!"
00:17:56.541,00:18:00.291,Yeah. Chompy is cleaning the algae off the coral.
00:18:00.333,00:18:03.958,Plus that whole cool thing where she makes sand.
00:18:06.083,00:18:08.833,"Okay, maybe we won't talk about that."
00:18:08.875,00:18:13.041,But what we should do is make sure Tidy meets Chompy.
00:18:13.083,00:18:16.666,"Um, so will you come to the kelp forest with us, Chompy?"
00:18:16.708,00:18:20.000,Kelp forest?
00:18:20.041,00:18:23.000,"Sure, I'll go."
00:18:23.041,00:18:25.500,I don't think so.
00:18:25.541,00:18:28.500,"Hmm. Well, I better pack a picnic, then."
00:18:28.541,00:18:31.333,It's always good to be prepared.
00:18:31.375,00:18:34.833,"Wow, she sounds like Tidy already."
00:18:36.291,00:18:39.708,"Well, you certainly are the most colorful parrotfish I've ever seen."
00:18:39.750,00:18:42.916,And you're the first garibaldi I've ever met.
00:18:42.958,00:18:44.583,"Oh, this is going good."
00:18:44.625,00:18:46.791,"Yeah, it's going great!"
00:18:46.833,00:18:48.583,I knew it.
00:18:48.625,00:18:51.375,"Well, uh, so, uh, do you like red algae?"
00:18:51.416,00:18:54.333,"Oh, uh..."
00:18:54.375,00:18:55.958,Does it taste the same as green?
00:18:56.000,00:18:57.666,- Uh...
00:18:57.708,00:19:01.166,I brought my own snack anyway.
00:19:03.166,00:19:08.291,"Uh, what, uh-- Oh, it's coral."
00:19:08.333,00:19:10.708,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
00:19:10.750,00:19:15.833,"Oh, is something wrong, Tidy?"
00:19:15.875,00:19:18.625,Hm?
00:19:18.666,00:19:22.666,"Uh, are you, uh, almost done, um, chewing that coral to bits?"
00:19:22.708,00:19:24.458,"Oh, sure!"
00:19:25.791,00:19:28.916,"Ah, oh boy."
00:19:28.958,00:19:37.750,"Ah, yeah-- What is that?"
00:19:37.791,00:19:41.708,"Oh, oh, that's how I make the sand."
00:19:41.750,00:19:43.125,It's what I do.
00:19:43.166,00:19:45.333,"Wait, y-you do that?"
00:19:45.375,00:19:50.833,"Uh, d-do you mean there's gonna be more sand - like that around here?"
00:19:50.875,00:19:55.625,Parrotfish make most of the sand in the whole ocean.
00:19:55.666,00:20:03.041,"Ah, well, that is a wonderful skill, Chompy, and-- and I do appreciate it, but, uh-- Actually..."
00:20:03.083,00:20:06.208,be a good match.
00:20:06.250,00:20:09.541,Oh!
00:20:09.583,00:20:12.791,"Well, it was great meeting you, Tidy."
00:20:12.833,00:20:15.041,"Oh, you too, Chompy."
00:20:15.083,00:20:16.916,"Well, come back and visit anytime."
00:20:22.125,00:20:25.333,your Mrs. Tidy!
00:20:25.375,00:20:28.708,Oh! Thank you!
00:20:30.708,00:20:32.875,"Well, what's next?"
00:20:32.916,00:20:35.000,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:20:37.041,00:20:41.250,"Well, you guys, it's not like we didn't try."
00:20:41.291,00:20:43.416,"Yep, we tried."
00:20:43.458,00:20:45.708,Tidy said to wait and have faith.
00:20:45.750,00:20:48.541,"Yep, maybe that's all we can do."
00:20:48.583,00:20:49.958,Yeah.
00:20:54.708,00:20:57.333,- You're so beautiful.
00:20:57.375,00:20:59.666,Hey!
00:20:59.708,00:21:02.708,It's just so neat around here.
00:21:02.750,00:21:05.750,"Every little speck is-- Oh, I'm so glad you appreciate it."
00:21:05.791,00:21:07.250,- I've been working very hard.
00:21:07.291,00:21:09.250,Who's that?
00:21:09.291,00:21:11.500,Are there two Tidys?
00:21:11.541,00:21:15.625,Or is that one...
00:21:15.666,00:21:19.083,How did she get here?
00:21:19.125,00:21:21.625,"Oh, heya, kids."
00:21:21.666,00:21:25.958,I'd like you to meet...
00:21:26.000,00:21:29.833,"Oh, you must be Splash."
00:21:29.875,00:21:32.083,And this must be Dunk and Ripple.
00:21:32.125,00:21:33.791,- Hi!
00:21:33.833,00:21:35.333,My name's Neat.
00:21:35.375,00:21:38.250,It's because I just love to clean.
00:21:40.083,00:21:42.291,Neat and Tidy?
00:21:44.083,00:21:46.250,How did you two find each other?
00:21:46.291,00:21:57.750,"I was just swimming by looking for the cleanest algae bed around when I saw this one here making all these mo-o-ves, and it just led me right to this kelp forest."
00:21:57.791,00:22:02.583,"Yeah, and as soon as she got here, she started cleaning right along beside me."
00:22:04.916,00:22:07.583,She loves to clean?
00:22:07.625,00:22:09.666,She likes red algae!
00:22:09.708,00:22:14.041,Now this is the perfect match.
00:22:14.083,00:22:15.541,"Oh, it finally happened."
00:22:15.583,00:22:18.083,I've been waiting for Neat all my life.
00:22:18.125,00:22:22.000,"Oh, and I finally found my Mr. Tidy."
00:22:24.500,00:22:27.125,"Ah, we owe you kids a big thanks."
00:22:30.291,00:22:32.625,"Ohh, Tidy."

00:22:39.708,00:22:42.083,"Oh, and can you take that pebble with you?"
00:22:42.125,00:22:43.833,Wouldn't want to leave a mess.
00:22:45.166,00:22:48.375,"Yep, they're perfect together."
00:22:49.750,00:22:50.916,- Thank yo-u-u!
00:22:50.958,00:22:52.708,"Oh, you say it just like me, Tidy."
00:22:52.750,00:22:54.083,I know.
00:01:03.625,00:01:06.250,Dorsal!
00:01:06.291,00:01:08.041,"Yeah, wasn't he around here last time?"
00:01:08.083,00:01:10.916,"I mean, isn't this sort of, uh, his area?"
00:01:12.208,00:01:14.416,- Dorsal!
00:01:14.458,00:01:16.791,"- How's it going, guys?"
00:01:16.833,00:01:22.208,We were trying to find you to see if you wanna go off - and play with us for the day.
00:01:22.250,00:01:29.416,I always want to play - Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
00:01:29.458,00:01:31.416,We're gonna have so much fun together!
00:01:31.458,00:01:32.666,But not just yet.
00:01:32.708,00:01:34.458,"Why not, Dorsal?"
00:01:38.500,00:01:43.375,"Oh, of course! Your job!"
00:01:44.541,00:01:46.125,- Yeah.
00:01:46.166,00:01:53.000,"Well, everyone in the dolphin pod has a job that they do to help the group and to get important things done."
00:01:53.041,00:01:54.458,I get it!
00:01:54.500,00:01:56.791,Like when Wave directs traffic on the reef.
00:01:56.833,00:01:59.250,- Right!
00:01:59.291,00:02:02.500,He takes care of my 499 brothers.
00:02:06.375,00:02:09.041,"We have caregivers in my pod, too."
00:02:09.083,00:02:10.208,They look after the calves.
00:02:10.250,00:02:15.166,"Some dolphins look for food, and others protect all the members of the pod."
00:02:15.208,00:02:17.375,That sounds like an important job.
00:02:17.416,00:02:18.625,It sure is!
00:02:18.666,00:02:23.458,The protectors keep the pod safe by watching out for anything that might be dangerous.
00:02:23.500,00:02:26.041,Do I look dangerous?
00:02:26.083,00:02:29.083,- Not so much.
00:02:29.125,00:02:33.541,"The cool thing is, I get to do different jobs from day to day."
00:02:33.583,00:02:36.291,"On some days, my job is spinning!"
00:02:36.333,00:02:39.250,- That's my favorite.
00:02:39.291,00:02:44.000,"It tells the other dolphins where the edge of the pod, or group, is."
00:02:44.041,00:02:46.083,"Well, that's so cool!"
00:02:46.125,00:02:48.375,I really love being part of a group.
00:02:53.041,00:02:56.708,"And best of all, there's always somebody to play with!"
00:02:56.750,00:03:01.333,Today I get to use my powers of echolocation to find food!
00:03:01.375,00:03:04.708,- It's a super important job.
00:03:04.750,00:03:07.791,"But it's so much fun, it feels like play!"
00:03:10.875,00:03:14.083,Oh! Gotta swim!
00:03:14.125,00:03:16.375,- Cool!
00:03:17.583,00:03:19.208,It's okay.
00:03:20.708,00:03:23.291,"You know, guys, having a job sounds really fun."
00:03:23.333,00:03:24.708,And important.
00:03:24.750,00:03:28.375,I never even knew there was such a thing!
00:03:28.416,00:03:31.125,How does Dorsal even know what to do?
00:03:31.166,00:03:34.125,Did someone teach him how to do his job?
00:03:34.166,00:03:36.208,How did he even know about it?
00:03:36.250,00:03:40.041,And does everyone have a job?
00:03:40.083,00:03:42.208,I don't know.
00:03:42.250,00:03:43.291,Hey!
00:03:43.333,00:03:45.333,Let's have jobs!
00:03:45.375,00:03:46.916,- Okay!
00:03:46.958,00:03:49.833,- I call spinning!
00:03:49.875,00:03:51.708,Sounds like fun!
00:03:51.750,00:03:53.875,Which job should we do?
00:03:53.916,00:03:55.750,Oh. Right.
00:03:55.791,00:03:59.416,"Yeah. Well, what can we do that will help the group?"
00:03:59.458,00:04:01.250,"Yeah, I don't know, Splash."
00:04:03.250,00:04:04.333,Hmm.

00:04:09.750,00:04:11.208,Let's do it!
00:04:11.250,00:04:13.291,"Hey, you guys figure out how to help Reeftown."
00:04:13.333,00:04:16.083,I'm gonna ask the biggest helper I know.
00:04:16.125,00:04:17.291,"Well, who's that?"
00:04:17.333,00:04:20.041,- Tidy!
00:04:20.083,00:04:22.416,- See ya back in Reeftown!
00:04:22.458,00:04:23.375,Tell him we said hi!
00:04:23.416,00:04:25.333,- Bye!
00:04:29.250,00:04:32.250,"Oh, hello, Bubbles!"

00:04:36.041,00:04:37.375,"Well, take your time."
00:04:37.416,00:04:40.833,"I don't want to interrupt your, uh, job."
00:04:40.875,00:04:42.041,Ooh!
00:04:42.083,00:04:46.250,"Well, uh, it's a job that I love, keeping it clean!"
00:04:46.291,00:04:48.750,"Two, three, four!"
00:04:48.791,00:04:50.750,- Ah.
00:05:32.875,00:05:56.208,"as you found it Keep it clean, I'm begging you."
00:05:56.250,00:05:58.041,"- Oh, Tidy!"
00:05:58.083,00:06:00.666,That's exactly what I came here to talk to you about...

00:06:07.208,00:06:09.541,"Well, um, how'd you get it?"
00:06:09.583,00:06:12.250,"And, um, who told you to do it?"
00:06:12.291,00:06:14.541,Pew!
00:06:14.583,00:06:16.750,That's-- that's a really good question.
00:06:16.791,00:06:18.625,"Well, I've always cleaned."
00:06:18.666,00:06:23.958,It was just something I could do to help the kelp forest and all the creatures that live here.
00:06:24.000,00:06:30.083,"So, um, a job is something - that you do to help others."
00:06:31.916,00:06:34.250,"Can I try cleaning, like you?"
00:06:34.291,00:06:36.416,Of course! Be my guest!
00:06:36.458,00:06:40.708,I encourage every young fish to keep the kelp forest clean!
00:06:40.750,00:06:42.458,- Give it a try!
00:06:42.500,00:06:44.291,"Ahh, this one."
00:06:44.333,00:06:46.458,"Whoo, not too heavy."
00:06:46.500,00:06:48.416,I'm-a keep this for finball.
00:06:50.625,00:06:52.125,- Whoo-hoo!
00:06:53.666,00:06:55.416,"Uh, Bubbles, uh..."
00:06:55.458,00:06:58.000,"You know, not everyone was born to be a cleaner."
00:06:58.041,00:07:01.125,I'm starting to see that.
00:07:01.166,00:07:04.583,It's okay if cleaning isn't your job.
00:07:05.916,00:07:08.333,I don't know what my job is yet.
00:07:08.375,00:07:12.291,"Oh, well, that's okay, you're still young."
00:07:12.333,00:07:14.041,But I'm sure if you keep looking...
00:07:15.958,00:07:17.166,"So, uh, buh-bye!"
00:07:17.208,00:07:19.041,"Okay. Hey, Tidy!"
00:07:19.083,00:07:20.875,Can I have this pebble for finball?
00:07:20.916,00:07:23.041,"Ooh, well, I don't see why not."
00:07:23.083,00:07:24.750,It's one less thing to clean!
00:07:27.416,00:07:30.083,Good luck finding your job!
00:07:30.125,00:07:33.750,Oh... my... starfish.
00:07:39.791,00:07:41.458,- Wow.
00:07:44.750,00:07:47.375,It's just you're so good at eating the algae off the coral.
00:07:47.416,00:07:49.875,"- Well, thank you!"
00:07:49.916,00:07:53.041,Oh! Look in here. Ah!
00:07:53.083,00:07:58.416,"Whoa, it's like your teeth and beak were specially made for this job!"
00:08:01.291,00:08:04.250,I just really wanted to help keep the coral clean.
00:08:04.291,00:08:09.083,"Plus, I love the way it tastes and crunches!"
00:08:09.125,00:08:11.166,- That seems simple.
00:08:09.125,00:08:14.333,"- Don't forget, I make new sand from the coral bits I eat, too."
00:08:14.375,00:08:19.500,My teeth grind the coral up so I can digest it and turn it into sand!
00:08:19.541,00:08:22.750,Wow! It really is like you have two jobs!
00:08:22.791,00:08:25.166,That one was a bonus!
00:08:27.500,00:08:30.541,"Well, you have lots of time to figure that out, Splash."
00:08:30.583,00:08:33.583,Just think about what you were made to do.
00:08:33.625,00:08:36.416,Hmm.
00:08:36.458,00:08:37.541,- Oh!
00:08:37.583,00:08:39.791,Heads up! Coming at ya!
00:08:41.250,00:08:43.583,"- Oh, yeah? All right."

00:08:47.041,00:08:50.666,"Yeah, well, if only I could figure out what my job is."
00:08:50.708,00:08:53.000,Whoo!
00:08:53.041,00:08:55.500,"Um, so... Denny."
00:08:55.541,00:08:58.791,How did you know you wanted to clean teeth?
00:08:58.833,00:09:05.208,"Ripple, I always liked cleaning teeth, and I'm not afraid to jump right into someone's mouth and grab those delicious parasites!"
00:09:05.250,00:09:08.291,"Do you think I'd be good at cleaning teeth, too?"
00:09:08.333,00:09:10.875,Why don't you help me with Maury and we'll find out?
00:09:10.916,00:09:13.208,- Okay!
00:09:13.250,00:09:14.375,"- All right, let's see."
00:09:16.583,00:09:19.458,"Maybe if I, uh, take another look in..."
00:09:19.500,00:09:22.041,"- You know what, Maury?"
00:09:22.083,00:09:24.500,You look like you need some distraction.
00:09:24.541,00:09:27.000,- Yeah!
00:09:29.833,00:09:34.958,"Well, I haven't, either, but I hear it's a long tale."
00:09:37.875,00:09:41.041,- Pretty good.
00:09:41.083,00:09:44.625,"You're all set, Maury!"
00:09:44.666,00:09:46.708,You know what?
00:09:44.666,00:09:53.958,"I didn't even mind having my mouth open for so long because, well, Ripple was doing such a great job of keeping me entertained."
00:09:54.000,00:09:57.625,"- Oh, you are a natural, kid!"
00:09:57.666,00:10:01.041,But I wish I was a natural at figuring out my job.
00:10:01.083,00:10:03.708,It's definitely not teeth cleaning.
00:10:03.750,00:10:08.166,"Hmm, I wonder if the others have found their jobs yet."
00:10:08.208,00:10:11.208,"Oh, look who it is!"
00:10:11.250,00:10:12.958,"Dunk! Hey, Dunk!"
00:10:13.000,00:10:17.583,"Hey, Scout and Snap."
00:10:17.625,00:10:23.583,"- You're welcome to join us, - But you know-- no."
00:10:23.625,00:10:25.291,Digging in the sand is our job.
00:10:25.333,00:10:28.583,That's great!
00:10:28.625,00:10:33.875,"Well, digging helps the sand-- And keeps a healthy habitat for other creatures."
00:10:33.916,00:10:36.875,This must be my job.
00:10:36.916,00:10:39.500,-Right!
00:10:39.541,00:10:41.583,- Look at him go!

00:10:43.458,00:10:44.833,"Ooh, I like this pattern!"
00:10:44.875,00:10:48.625,Dunk! That is amazing!
00:10:48.666,00:10:52.250,- You made some terrific art-- - Just by having fun!
00:10:52.291,00:10:55.416,And that's the most important thing at your age.
00:10:55.458,00:11:00.291,"Yeah, but I was so busy having fun, I forgot about my job."
00:11:00.333,00:11:06.458,I'd better go see what everyone else's jobs are.
00:11:06.500,00:11:09.916,"Hey, guys, did you guys all find your jobs?"
00:11:09.958,00:11:12.541,"- Yeah, me neither."
00:11:12.583,00:11:15.416,"I tried a few jobs, and I had a lot of fun..."
00:11:15.458,00:11:18.375,but I don't know what my job is supposed to be.
00:11:18.416,00:11:22.916,"Yeah, all we did today was make a game out of every job we tried."
00:11:22.958,00:11:25.708,We just kept playing and being silly.
00:11:25.750,00:11:28.916,Don't you see?
00:11:28.958,00:11:30.833,But we're supposed to do important stuff.
00:11:30.875,00:11:34.083,Playing is important.
00:11:34.125,00:11:35.583,- Oh.

00:11:46.666,00:11:49.958,Jobs? Ha! That's great!
00:11:50.000,00:11:52.791,It turns out that the best job for kids like us is...
00:11:55.583,00:11:58.458,Now that's a job that I can get behind!
00:12:02.625,00:12:05.708,"- Hi, everybody!"
00:12:05.750,00:12:07.000,- Hi!

00:12:31.666,00:12:34.666,I call it A Puffer Fish Ponders.
00:12:34.708,00:12:37.708,- It's amazing!
00:12:37.750,00:12:38.958,It sure is!
00:12:39.000,00:12:40.500,"You know, it's a talent of yours."
00:12:40.541,00:12:42.458,"Ooh, I have other talents, too!"
00:12:42.500,00:12:47.125,- I'm an excellent puffer!
00:12:47.166,00:12:50.833,- Wait a second. That's it!
00:12:50.875,00:12:54.375,Let's have a Reeftown talent show!
00:12:59.625,00:13:08.541,It's a show where we all share our unique abilities so everyone can appreciate all of the amazing talents we have here in Reeftown!
00:13:08.583,00:13:11.625,That's the best idea I've heard all day!
00:13:11.666,00:13:14.375,"- Oh, this is gonna be great!"
00:13:14.416,00:13:17.750,"- Bubbles, you can direct."
00:13:17.791,00:13:19.625,"Ripple and Dunk, you can set up the stage."
00:13:19.666,00:13:21.291,- Yeah!
00:13:21.333,00:13:22.708,And I'll go line up the talent acts!
00:13:22.750,00:13:24.500,- Got it!
00:13:24.541,00:13:30.166,"Well, uh, now I guess we just have to find a way - to spread the word."
00:13:30.208,00:13:31.916,"Oh, hey, Maury!"
00:13:31.958,00:13:33.916,We're gonna throw a Reeftown talent show.
00:13:33.958,00:13:38.291,And we want everyone in Reeftown to show us what they got!
00:13:38.333,00:13:40.291,Oh!
00:13:38.333,00:13:44.250,"Well, then, allow me to use my talent and spread the word!"
00:14:38.833,00:14:40.708,- Oh!
00:15:16.041,00:15:17.750,- Have you heard?!
00:15:17.791,00:15:21.416,Reeftown is having its first-ever talent show!
00:15:21.458,00:15:23.833,A talent show?
00:15:26.125,00:15:28.500,"Oh, and everyone's invited to perform."
00:15:28.541,00:15:32.166,Can't wait to see what you do!
00:15:32.208,00:15:35.541,A talent show is no place for lil' ole me.
00:15:35.583,00:15:40.583,It's not like I have any special talents or anything.
00:15:40.625,00:15:42.250,"Oh, thank you, Ripple!"
00:15:42.291,00:15:44.583,Finally someone who knows what they're doing!
00:15:44.625,00:15:47.083,"Okay, now, this is very important."
00:15:47.125,00:15:51.958,This is where you're going to float and announce all of the talent acts.
00:15:55.416,00:15:56.708,- I promise you-- - Splash!
00:15:56.750,00:15:58.416,You know you can never rehearse enough!
00:15:58.458,00:16:04.666,"Okay, then you're going to come over here and wait while they show their talents."
00:16:04.708,00:16:07.083,- Got it?!
00:16:07.125,00:16:08.208,Got it?
00:16:08.250,00:16:11.000,- You got it.
00:16:11.041,00:16:14.291,"So now I know everyone's act, Um, wait a minute."
00:16:14.333,00:16:17.083,What about Pearlene?
00:16:17.125,00:16:19.541,"Wait, Pearlene?!"
00:16:19.583,00:16:21.000,She's gotta show her talents!
00:16:21.041,00:16:22.708,"Yeah, maybe she didn't hear about it."
00:16:22.750,00:16:24.291,"You know, I'll go tell her about the show."
00:16:24.333,00:16:26.041,- I'll be right back.
00:16:26.083,00:16:30.083,Go tell her about the show!
00:16:33.375,00:16:36.125,- I'm always home.
00:16:36.166,00:16:39.875,Well... I just want to make sure you heard about the Reeftown talent show.
00:16:39.916,00:16:42.500,"Oh, I heard about it, and it's not for me."
00:16:42.541,00:16:44.000,- Sorry.
00:16:44.041,00:16:46.583,It's-- it's for everyone in Reeftown.
00:16:49.500,00:16:52.916,"Pearlene, everyone has a special talent."
00:16:52.958,00:16:56.416,"Well, you know I get shy about openin' up to folks."
00:16:56.458,00:17:01.666,"This is a Reeftown talent show, and, well, you're an important part of Reeftown."
00:17:01.708,00:17:03.625,"So, won't you at least come watch?"
00:17:03.666,00:17:06.916,I guess I would like to see everybody's talents.
00:17:06.958,00:17:08.416,And who knows.
00:17:08.458,00:17:11.750,Maybe we'll just find yours...
00:17:15.583,00:17:18.500,"- Ripple, are you ready?"
00:17:15.583,00:17:21.416,"- I think so. They're just-- you know, they're very-- they're very stubborn boys."
00:17:21.458,00:17:23.583,"Okay, it'll be fine."
00:17:23.625,00:17:24.833,"Hey, Pearlene."
00:17:24.875,00:17:26.458,Are you excited to see the show?
00:17:26.500,00:17:28.791,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:28.833,00:17:30.500,"Yeah, well, who knows."
00:17:30.541,00:17:32.541,Maybe you'll figure out your talent soon enough.
00:17:32.583,00:17:35.625,- Maybe.
00:17:37.416,00:17:38.625,Okay.
00:17:40.500,00:17:41.833,"Hi, everyone!"
00:17:41.875,00:17:44.833,And welcome to the Reeftown Talent Show!
00:17:44.875,00:17:48.500,- Nice!
00:17:48.541,00:17:54.625,Today you'll be seeing lots of amazing talents found right here in Reeftown!
00:17:56.250,00:18:02.791,"And now, Denny the cleaner shrimp and Maury the moray eel!"
00:18:04.541,00:18:14.666,"I, Denny the cleaner shrimp, shall now perform the daring act of climbing inside this wild moray eel's mouth to remove parasites!"
00:18:14.708,00:18:16.041,Ooh!
00:18:19.250,00:18:23.291,Just get rid of this.
00:18:23.333,00:18:24.666,Ta-da!
00:18:27.250,00:18:29.875,Ah-ah-ah...
00:18:29.916,00:18:32.833,- choo!
00:18:32.875,00:18:39.416,"Oh, it's all part of the act, folks, - Wow!"
00:18:40.625,00:18:41.958,- Thank you!
00:18:43.208,00:18:45.583,"What a way to kick things off, eh?"
00:18:45.625,00:18:47.750,How can they top that?!
00:18:47.791,00:18:56.333,"Presenting Snap, the amazingly talented snapping shrimp."
00:18:56.375,00:18:58.791,"Thank you, Scout, my sweetheart."
00:18:58.833,00:19:00.583,"You're welcome, dear."
00:19:00.625,00:19:05.875,Note how Snap's claw is nowhere near the pebbles.
00:19:05.916,00:19:07.833,I'm gonna knock 'em down without touchin' em!
00:19:07.875,00:19:14.833,"He's gonna knock 'em down without touchin' em, when I say the trigger word, which I'm not gonna say right now."
00:19:14.875,00:19:16.666,Did you say now? Snap!
00:19:16.708,00:19:18.958,- Oh!
00:19:19.000,00:19:20.458,"Oh, that was amazing!"
00:19:20.500,00:19:23.041,I did not see that coming!
00:19:23.083,00:19:26.375,- How'd I do?
00:19:26.416,00:19:28.125,- Thank you!
00:19:28.166,00:19:29.416,"Oh, thank you!"
00:19:29.458,00:19:31.791,- So good!
00:19:31.833,00:19:33.416,Fantastic!
00:19:33.458,00:19:37.583,"I, Chompy the Parrotfish-- hi!"
00:19:37.625,00:19:43.708,Shall now chew this coral and produce sand in front of your very eyes!
00:19:57.083,00:20:00.375,Gets me every time!
00:20:00.416,00:20:02.500,Ta-da! Ha ha!
00:20:02.541,00:20:10.875,"And now, as my grand finale, I shall secrete a slime bubble that I can sleep in!"
00:20:10.916,00:20:14.250,What?! It can't be done!
00:20:20.458,00:20:22.250,Incredible!
00:20:22.291,00:20:24.666,"- Now, that is amazing."
00:20:24.708,00:20:28.208,"Oh, Chompy, well done."
00:20:28.250,00:20:31.583,"Oh, well, thank you!"
00:20:33.458,00:20:35.416,Thank you.
00:20:36.625,00:20:39.375,- Ta-da!
00:20:39.416,00:20:43.375,Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
00:20:45.750,00:20:48.833,Ah-ha. Ooh-whoo.
00:20:51.666,00:20:52.791,Nice.
00:20:57.833,00:20:59.375,"Go, Wave!"
00:20:59.416,00:21:01.125,Shake a tentacle!
00:21:01.166,00:21:04.625,Wave's dancing is so wonderful.
00:21:04.666,00:21:08.916,"Now, that is some real talent."
00:21:11.541,00:21:14.333,"Everyone's talent is unique, something that's really their own."
00:21:14.375,00:21:15.708,That's true.
00:21:15.750,00:21:18.500,"Yeah, something that makes them shine."
00:21:18.541,00:21:19.750,"Yeah, shine!"
00:21:19.791,00:21:22.041,Shine!
00:21:22.083,00:21:23.375,Pearlene!
00:21:23.416,00:21:26.416,I think we may have just figured out your amazing talent to share!
00:21:26.458,00:21:27.875,- Oh!
00:21:27.916,00:21:29.416,- Okay.
00:21:29.458,00:21:34.041,"Well, uh, folks, that brings us to the end of our Reeftown talent show."
00:21:35.500,00:21:45.750,"But before we go, for our grand finale, my good friend Pearlene wants to show all of you something really special, a talent that really makes her shine."
00:21:45.791,00:21:47.000,"Hi, y'all."
00:21:47.041,00:21:50.333,"- Go for it, Pearlene."
00:21:55.208,00:21:57.458,"Oh, that's amazing!"
00:21:59.750,00:22:03.833,- Pearlene!
00:22:03.875,00:22:06.583,beautiful pearl I've ever seen!
00:22:06.625,00:22:08.958,"- You like that one, Chompy?"
00:22:09.000,00:22:12.833,"Well, that's right."
00:22:12.875,00:22:16.208,"Actually, folks, Pearlene's being really modest."
00:22:16.250,00:22:18.583,Not all oysters can make pearls.
00:22:20.250,00:22:23.791,This is something that only very special oysters can do.
00:22:23.833,00:22:25.666,- I can't do that!
00:22:25.708,00:22:28.875,- They saved the best for last.
00:22:28.916,00:22:30.541,"Thank you, everybody."
00:22:30.583,00:22:32.541,"And thank you too, Splash."
00:22:32.583,00:22:35.708,You helped me figure out what my talent is.
00:22:35.750,00:22:40.125,"And that is Splash's talent, right, everybody?"
00:22:40.166,00:22:45.625,He makes all his friends feel special - just for being who they are!
00:22:47.791,00:22:50.291,"You know, I never thought about it like that."
00:22:50.333,00:22:54.125,I guess everyone really does have a talent after all.
00:01:06.083,00:01:08.083,"So, big day!"
00:01:08.125,00:01:10.833,Ha ha! Very big!
00:01:10.875,00:01:14.625,The Reeftown Rangers Rally Race only comes once a year.
00:01:14.666,00:01:16.125,You guys ready?
00:01:16.166,00:01:20.000,"Oh, you'd better be, 'cause today is my day."
00:01:20.041,00:01:23.625,I can't lose if I have this with me.
00:01:25.791,00:01:29.291,Not just any rock.
00:01:29.333,00:01:32.916,Whew! Who was there with me when I won my first race?
00:01:32.958,00:01:37.875,- Who was there with me when I won the big Reeftown art contest?
00:01:37.916,00:01:39.500,"Uh, we were."
00:01:39.541,00:01:42.625,No. Lucky! My lucky rock!
00:01:42.666,00:01:43.833,It brings me luck.
00:01:43.875,00:01:49.750,"Uh, well, I'm glad all those good things happened for you, Dunk, but I don't think it's because of a rock."
00:01:49.791,00:01:53.500,"Yeah, and besides, it doesn't matter who wins the race."
00:01:56.833,00:01:59.458,- Whoo-hoo!
00:02:09.583,00:02:13.875,"I'm Splash, a fusilier."
00:02:13.916,00:02:17.458,I'm going global.
00:02:17.500,00:02:20.958,"Bubbles, that's me!"
00:02:21.000,00:02:23.333,Do I like stuff that's gross and gooey?
00:02:23.375,00:02:24.916,You bet!
00:02:32.041,00:02:35.541,I'm the artist known as Dunk.
00:02:39.666,00:02:41.000,"Ripple, I'm a seahorse."
00:03:09.625,00:03:11.708,Wait. Hang on.
00:03:13.250,00:03:15.333,"Uh, Dunk, are you sure you want to bring that rock?"
00:03:15.375,00:03:17.833,"It looks kind of, um, heavy."
00:03:17.875,00:03:20.916,Yeah.
00:03:20.958,00:03:23.541,Carrying a rock isn't going to bring you luck.
00:03:23.583,00:03:26.000,It's gonna weigh you down.
00:03:26.041,00:03:29.333,"Clearly, neither of you understand luck."
00:03:29.375,00:03:31.875,It doesn't have to make sense.
00:03:31.916,00:03:33.333,I'll be fine.
00:03:33.375,00:03:35.958,All right. Suit yourself.
00:03:36.000,00:03:39.583,First one that gets back to the arch wins!
00:03:39.625,00:03:41.333,- Yeah!
00:03:41.375,00:03:43.875,- Yeah. Okay. Here we go.
00:03:43.916,00:03:44.916,- Ready?
00:03:44.958,00:03:46.083,- Set?
00:03:46.125,00:03:47.875,- Go!
00:03:47.916,00:03:49.583,- Watch out! Here I come!
00:03:49.625,00:03:54.500,"All right, Lucky, if you have any luck left in you, now would be a good time to use it."
00:03:54.541,00:03:56.250,Any second now.
00:03:56.291,00:03:59.458,Any time would be great!
00:04:01.000,00:04:04.291,"- Okay, that was great!"
00:04:04.333,00:04:07.958,"Yeah! Great job, Bubbles!"
00:04:08.000,00:04:09.041,"Great job, Dunk!"
00:04:09.083,00:04:11.375,"Great-- uh, where's Dunk?"
00:04:11.416,00:04:12.958,Uh...
00:04:13.000,00:04:17.625,Oh! There he is! Over there!
00:04:17.666,00:04:19.500,"Drop the rock, Dunk!"
00:04:19.541,00:04:23.541,I can't. This rock is lucky!
00:04:23.583,00:04:26.208,"Oh, boy."
00:04:26.250,00:04:28.291,- Aww.
00:04:28.333,00:04:30.291,"Oh, is that you, Dunk?"
00:04:30.333,00:04:33.791,Yep. I don't understand what happened.
00:04:33.833,00:04:39.250,"I had my lucky rock and everything, - but it didn't help."
00:04:39.291,00:04:41.666,Maybe today just isn't your lucky day.
00:04:41.708,00:04:44.500,"You know what, Ripple?"
00:04:44.541,00:04:47.125,Today isn't my lucky day.
00:04:47.166,00:04:49.541,Which can only mean one thing.
00:04:49.583,00:04:51.750,"Uh, tomorrow will be better?"
00:04:51.791,00:04:54.583,It means my rock is no longer lucky.
00:04:56.041,00:05:01.666,"Ha. Now that I've gotten rid of that, my luck should be getting better any-- oh!"
00:05:03.791,00:05:07.500,It's following me!
00:05:07.541,00:05:11.750,"Dunk, all you did was throw it above your head, and it came back down."
00:05:11.791,00:05:15.041,It must be more powerful than I thought.
00:05:15.083,00:05:18.291,But I'll get rid of it yet.
00:05:18.333,00:05:21.666,Wha-- uh-oh. I-- - Uh...
00:05:21.708,00:05:22.958,Yeesh.
00:05:26.083,00:05:27.750,Okay.
00:05:26.083,00:05:33.291,"Maybe I couldn't throw it high enough to keep it away from me, but let's see it come back from all the way up here."
00:05:33.333,00:05:35.750,Ha-ha! Yeah!
00:05:35.791,00:05:38.458,"Uh, are you sure about that, Dunk?"
00:05:38.500,00:05:41.333,Yeah. It's great.
00:05:46.166,00:05:52.083,"Dunk, I'm glad you're happy now, but I think you should know that that rock was just a rock."
00:05:52.125,00:05:55.208,Right. So you're saying the rock wasn't lucky?
00:05:55.250,00:05:57.083,That's right.
00:05:57.125,00:06:02.541,"Agreed, the rock used to be lucky, and now it's not, which is why I got rid of it."
00:06:02.583,00:06:06.958,Uhh... okay.
00:06:07.000,00:06:09.333,"- Oh, boy."
00:06:14.791,00:06:17.083,Oh! Hey! What's going on here?
00:06:17.125,00:06:20.625,Wha-- where'd you come from?
00:06:20.666,00:06:23.750,"- Hey, Maury."
00:06:23.791,00:06:25.833,"Listen, did any of you lose this rock?"
00:06:25.875,00:06:27.666,It just kind of showed up here.
00:06:33.666,00:06:36.208,"Okay, this is just getting too weird."
00:06:36.250,00:06:38.625,Maybe there is something to that rock.
00:06:38.666,00:06:41.416,What do you mean?
00:06:41.458,00:06:43.583,This rock used to bring me luck.
00:06:43.625,00:06:45.083,And now it doesn't.
00:06:45.125,00:06:46.833,"Luck, huh?"
00:06:46.875,00:06:49.250,I've never had much luck.
00:06:49.291,00:06:55.250,"It sounds like this rock is very, very special."
00:06:55.291,00:06:58.625,"I mean, if you don't want it anymore, I can be a pal and take it."
00:06:58.666,00:07:07.333,"Thanks, Maury. I need to bring back my good luck, which means I need to take this rock to a place where it will never return."
00:07:07.375,00:07:09.625,"Uh, where's that?"
00:07:09.666,00:07:14.125,"Well, putting it high didn't work, so I'm gonna have to put it down low."
00:07:14.166,00:07:17.208,Wha-- are you gonna throw the rock into the deep?
00:07:20.916,00:07:24.500,the Mountain of Fire!
00:07:24.541,00:07:27.333,"Wait, wait, you're gonna throw it into a volcano?"
00:07:27.375,00:07:29.208,Will that even work?
00:07:30.916,00:07:35.000,"The magma inside a volcano can reach temperatures up to 2,400 degrees!"
00:07:37.041,00:07:43.750,"Yeah, in fact, magma itself is made out of melted rock from way underneath the ocean floor."
00:07:43.791,00:07:56.375,"I guess, but, Dunk, just so I have this straight, you're having the unluckiest day of your life, and your plan is to travel to the edge of an active volcano?"
00:07:56.416,00:07:58.041,Yep. What could go wrong?
00:07:58.083,00:08:00.041,- Uh...
00:08:00.083,00:08:02.458,Umm...
00:08:02.500,00:08:05.500,Maybe we should go with him just to be safe.
00:08:09.166,00:08:12.583,Huh.
00:08:22.291,00:08:23.750,"Are you sure about this, Dunk?"
00:08:23.791,00:08:26.875,"'Cause whatever you want to do, we'll be there for you, buddy."
00:08:29.791,00:08:32.291,I'm not backing down now.
00:08:37.250,00:08:40.875,"Oh, I can't let them melt that lucky rock."
00:08:40.916,00:08:44.250,It's much too... special.
00:08:54.375,00:08:56.958,- Whew.
00:08:58.875,00:09:00.333,"Okay, volcano."
00:09:00.375,00:09:06.166,"I've brought you an unlucky rock to melt down and add to your magma collection, so..."
00:09:06.208,00:09:07.958,here it goes.
00:09:08.000,00:09:09.500,"Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
00:09:09.541,00:09:13.250,"Uh, how far down does this volcano go, again?"
00:09:13.291,00:09:16.083,Way underneath the ocean floor.
00:09:16.125,00:09:18.125,So pretty far down then.
00:09:18.166,00:09:27.125,"Uh... you know, Dunk, good and bad things happen all the time, and maybe your rock has nothing to do with that."
00:09:27.166,00:09:30.000,You really think so?
00:09:32.166,00:09:35.500,"Okay, everything's shaking!"
00:09:35.541,00:09:37.541,"- Come on, Dunk!"
00:09:37.583,00:09:43.500,Wait! My rock!
00:09:43.541,00:09:47.333,"Dunk, wait, if you go back there, your rock isn't the only thing that'll melt."
00:09:47.375,00:09:49.875,It'll be fine.
00:09:49.916,00:09:53.208,"No, Dunk. Wait."
00:09:53.250,00:09:57.083,"You won your very first race because Bubbles showed you how to swim fast, right?"
00:09:57.125,00:10:02.958,"Well, I mean, that helped, but-- And you won that art contest because, well, Ripple found the perfect pebble for your sculpture."
00:10:03.000,00:10:07.083,It wasn't a lucky rock or shell or anything else that helped you.
00:10:07.125,00:10:10.666,It was your friends.
00:10:13.750,00:10:15.791,"Come on, Dunk."
00:10:22.208,00:10:23.916,It's mine!
00:10:23.958,00:10:27.916,"Oh, I'm finally gonna have good luck."
00:10:29.541,00:10:31.500,"Ugh, now I can't see."
00:10:31.541,00:10:33.333,So much for good luck.
00:10:36.125,00:10:37.708,We gotta go! Hurry!
00:10:37.750,00:10:39.333,Okay!
00:10:45.208,00:10:48.083,"- Oh, boy."
00:10:51.750,00:10:54.583,"Thanks, guys."
00:10:54.625,00:10:56.166,"Oh, no problem, Maury."
00:10:56.208,00:10:59.500,But what were you doing up there?
00:10:59.541,00:11:07.583,"Oh, well, I was-- I was really hoping that some of that luck from the rock would rub off on, well, me."
00:11:07.625,00:11:09.125,"But that's the thing, Maury."
00:11:09.166,00:11:16.333,"This really smart fish once reminded me that every time something good happened to me, it wasn't because of the rock."
00:11:16.375,00:11:20.750,It was because of my friends being there to help me every step of the way.
00:11:20.791,00:11:30.041,"So, maybe instead of worrying about lucky rocks or lucky shells or whatever, having good friends by your side is the luckiest charm a fish can have."
00:11:30.083,00:11:34.458,"So, let me just check-- what you're saying is you don't want this rock anymore, right?"
00:11:34.500,00:11:37.125,"I mean, you don't mind if I keep it? Or..."
00:11:37.166,00:11:38.750,Nope. It's all yours.
00:11:38.791,00:11:41.416,I have all the luck I need right here.
00:11:41.458,00:11:43.500,"Oh, yay!"
00:11:43.541,00:11:46.250,But maybe I'll give it another rub for good luck.
00:11:46.291,00:11:48.583,Heh. Just in case.
00:12:03.375,00:12:06.833,"Good morning, Reeftown residents!"
00:12:06.875,00:12:10.791,It's going to be a fin-tastic day!
00:12:10.833,00:12:13.958,"Good morning, Denny and Maury!"
00:12:14.000,00:12:15.666,"- Oh, hi, Mayor Sting."
00:12:15.708,00:12:17.833,How's that teeth cleaning coming along?
00:12:17.875,00:12:20.333,"Oh, you know..."
00:12:22.541,00:12:26.541,"He says, A cleaner shrimp a day keeps the parasites away."
00:12:26.583,00:12:28.875,- Excellent!
00:12:28.916,00:12:30.333,Keep up the good work.
00:12:30.375,00:12:32.583,"- Okay, bye, Mayor Sting."
00:12:32.625,00:12:36.750,That should do it for now.
00:12:39.208,00:12:40.750,Perfect. Now spit.
00:12:40.791,00:12:42.750,Mm. Mm. Mmm?
00:12:42.791,00:12:45.000,- Whoa!
00:12:45.041,00:12:47.916,"Denny, you're right!"
00:12:47.958,00:12:49.958,"So, Maury, what's the news today?"
00:12:50.000,00:12:56.166,"Oh, uh, well, it's so early, I haven't gotten any news yet, but I'll go sniff around."
00:12:56.208,00:12:58.500,"- Okay, bye!"
00:12:58.541,00:13:00.875,- Morning.
00:13:00.916,00:13:03.500,"Hi, guys!"
00:13:03.541,00:13:05.166,News? What is it?
00:13:05.208,00:13:08.833,"You know, the scoop."
00:13:08.875,00:13:10.583,We know what news is.
00:13:10.625,00:13:12.416,But we don't know today's news.
00:13:12.458,00:13:16.875,"Well, that's because today, I want you to tell me the news."
00:13:16.916,00:13:21.583,Us? You're the one who's always popping out of caves and stuff with news.
00:13:21.625,00:13:25.375,"Hey, look, there's only so much popping out of caves one eel can do."
00:13:25.416,00:13:26.875,I could use a little help.
00:13:26.916,00:13:31.500,"Hey, do you want us to go around Reeftown with you and help you find news?"
00:13:31.541,00:13:32.958,That's the idea!
00:13:33.000,00:13:35.458,- Sounds great.
00:13:35.500,00:13:38.750,"Maury, I have an idea."
00:13:41.916,00:13:43.416,"- Morning, Gush!"
00:13:43.458,00:13:45.208,- Oh!
00:13:45.250,00:13:50.041,"Well, so far today, I've been sitting completely still waiting for food."
00:13:50.083,00:13:51.541,Is that news?
00:13:51.583,00:13:54.833,Uhh... how about more stuff about Reeftown?
00:13:54.875,00:13:56.375,"Well, why didn't you say so?"
00:13:56.416,00:13:59.125,"You've come to the right frogfish, my friend."
00:13:59.166,00:14:02.333,"Oh, do tell."
00:14:02.375,00:14:03.708,You heard it here first.
00:14:03.750,00:14:06.500,"Now, not everyone knows this, but..."
00:14:07.958,00:14:09.833,The reef... is made...
00:14:09.875,00:14:12.583,"of over 1,000 kinds of coral!"
00:14:12.625,00:14:17.541,"Uh, yeah, that's great information, but everyone here already knows that."
00:14:17.583,00:14:20.791,"Well, it's always good to be reminded of the facts, eh?"
00:14:20.833,00:14:25.875,Yeah. I think Maury was hoping for something everybody doesn't already know.
00:14:25.916,00:14:30.333,"Like, for example, I don't know who your new friend is over there."
00:14:30.375,00:14:33.291,- What new friend?
00:14:33.333,00:14:37.458,I mean where have you been hiding this purple frogfish?
00:14:37.500,00:14:41.375,Hello. Name's Maury.
00:14:41.416,00:14:45.291,"Maury, that's just some coral, not another frogfish."
00:14:46.750,00:14:49.833,Frogfish are very good at camouflage.
00:14:49.875,00:14:51.500,"Uh, yeah."
00:14:51.541,00:14:53.583,Look.
00:14:53.625,00:14:55.333,"- Good observation, Dunk."
00:14:55.375,00:14:57.125,Oh. Oh.
00:14:57.166,00:15:00.333,Moray eels don't see so well during the day.
00:15:00.375,00:15:02.250,Yeah.
00:15:02.291,00:15:03.708,Yes. They're nocturnal.
00:15:03.750,00:15:11.375,They don't have the best daytime vision because they are more active and use their eyes more - in the dark at night.
00:15:11.416,00:15:13.333,"Yeah, it's true."
00:15:13.375,00:15:16.625,- I didn't know that.
00:15:16.666,00:15:18.791,"Anyway, I've gotta go keep looking for news."
00:15:18.833,00:15:22.500,I need something to tell Denny and all of Reeftown.
00:15:23.875,00:15:27.583,"With all those brothers, there's gotta be lots of news in her home."
00:15:27.625,00:15:29.625,That's a great idea!
00:15:34.125,00:15:35.708,"Ooh! Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!"
00:15:35.750,00:15:38.458,What's the news?
00:15:38.500,00:15:44.708,"Well, seahorses prefer to swim upright and are too bony and hard for most predators to digest."
00:15:44.750,00:15:52.125,"Uh... okay, that's an interesting fact, but-- Also, their snouts let them poke into nooks and crannies for food."
00:15:52.166,00:15:54.750,"Oh, speaking of that, you want to go find a snack?"
00:15:54.791,00:16:00.500,"Well, yes on the snack, always, but everyone already knows about seahorses."
00:16:02.250,00:16:03.875,- Huh?
00:16:03.916,00:16:05.625,- Where?
00:16:05.666,00:16:08.500,"There's a big, giant fish swimming toward your home."
00:16:10.500,00:16:13.083,"Uh, no, that is not one big fish."
00:16:13.125,00:16:16.458,- Huh?
00:16:16.500,00:16:20.083,"Come on, boys!"
00:16:20.125,00:16:21.500,Look out!
00:16:32.875,00:16:35.625,"Yeah, I didn't see that one coming."
00:16:35.666,00:16:37.791,the whole problem.
00:16:37.833,00:16:39.416,You didn't see that?
00:16:39.458,00:16:42.416,Moray eels don't see too well during the daytime.
00:16:45.500,00:16:47.333,Really? I never knew that.
00:16:47.375,00:16:53.458,"In fact, my sniffer tells me there's a snack around here somewhere."
00:16:53.500,00:16:57.125,"I never knew you had such a good sense of smell, Maury."
00:16:57.166,00:16:59.666,"Huh? Oh, well, I don't really tell anyone."
00:16:59.708,00:17:03.041,Just a basic moray eel fact of life.
00:17:03.083,00:17:05.625,"Now, I'm off to find..."
00:17:05.666,00:17:07.708,Some real news?
00:17:07.750,00:17:10.666,"Hmm, let's see."
00:17:18.250,00:17:20.875,"Uh, did you just spit out a small white rock?"
00:17:20.916,00:17:25.791,"- Uh, well, actually, Maury-- - Because if Zee the shark is eating rocks, that is news, I tell ya!"
00:17:25.833,00:17:27.750,"Now, this is something I can report."
00:17:27.791,00:17:30.125,- It's just a tooth.
00:17:30.166,00:17:34.583,A tooth? A tooth?!
00:17:36.500,00:17:37.833,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
00:17:37.875,00:17:41.291,Losing teeth is very normal for a shark.
00:17:41.333,00:17:42.458,It happens every day.
00:17:42.500,00:17:44.500,- Yeah. True.
00:17:44.541,00:17:45.708,I guess we knew that.
00:17:45.750,00:17:48.583,"But would that still be news, Maury?"
00:17:48.625,00:17:50.916,"No, I guess not."
00:17:50.958,00:17:54.833,Are you sure it wasn't a rock?
00:17:54.875,00:17:57.458,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
00:17:57.500,00:17:59.666,What's that thing out there?
00:17:59.708,00:18:01.333,Where?
00:18:01.375,00:18:02.708,I don't see anything.
00:18:02.750,00:18:03.875,"No, no. Look out there."
00:18:03.916,00:18:09.791,"Are you telling me that that's not a giant acanthaster sea star, ready to eat all the coral on the reef?"
00:18:09.833,00:18:11.833,I really don't think so.
00:18:11.875,00:18:13.958,Wha'? It's huge!
00:18:14.000,00:18:16.125,I can see it already.
00:18:16.166,00:18:18.250,Do you mean this?
00:18:18.291,00:18:21.875,"Uh, I guess it looks different right next to you."
00:18:21.916,00:18:25.083,Ugh.
00:18:25.125,00:18:27.083,Maybe I've lost my touch.
00:18:27.125,00:18:31.583,"Don't look at me, Splash."
00:18:31.625,00:18:35.000,- Ugh!
00:18:35.041,00:18:38.666,"Oh, well, let's see."
00:18:35.041,00:18:40.000,"I sit real still, - know what I mean?"
00:18:40.041,00:18:42.166,"Yeah, and I wait."
00:18:46.000,00:18:46.916,- Yeah!
00:18:46.958,00:18:49.333,"- Uh, no."
00:18:49.375,00:18:51.958,I'm not usually sitting and waiting for very long.
00:18:52.000,00:18:54.083,- Oh.
00:18:54.125,00:18:55.625,But I'll sit and wait with you anyway.
00:18:55.666,00:18:59.333,"Aw, Splash!"
00:18:59.375,00:19:03.041,And you're a good sitter and waiter for news.
00:19:03.083,00:19:05.708,"Oh, well, I don't want to brag, but..."
00:19:05.750,00:19:08.666,"you know, moray eels are very good at this sort of thing."
00:19:08.708,00:19:10.375,We're good at sitting still.
00:19:10.416,00:19:12.541,Mm-hmm.
00:19:13.958,00:19:16.041,"Yeah, you sure are."
00:19:16.083,00:19:23.500,"Yellowback fusiliers are more of an active type, though, so you mind if I take a quick break to go see - what the others are up to?"
00:19:23.541,00:19:26.041,Just holler if you find any news!
00:19:26.083,00:19:27.833,"Ah, well, you know I will."
00:19:27.875,00:19:30.000,"Thanks, Splash!"
00:19:33.875,00:19:35.416,Have you heard?
00:19:37.083,00:19:39.750,"Pretty, pretty eel."
00:19:39.791,00:19:41.000,"- Hey, Maury!"
00:19:41.041,00:19:42.666,Aah!
00:19:42.708,00:19:47.166,"- Oh, oh, it's you guys."
00:19:47.208,00:19:49.666,Yeah. You've been here on the sandy bed all day.
00:19:49.708,00:19:55.791,"Yeah, well, I wanted some news to report about Reeftown, but I can't find anything."
00:19:55.833,00:19:58.458,"- Aww, that's too bad."
00:19:58.500,00:20:00.791,And it's all because I can't see so well.
00:20:00.833,00:20:06.541,"You see, my eyes are better at night, and I have to use my nose to tell me what's going on during the day."
00:20:06.583,00:20:11.791,"Yeah, we all know that now, but why didn't we know that before today?"
00:20:11.833,00:20:15.916,"I guess I didn't want anyone to know, because I was kind of shy about it."
00:20:15.958,00:20:22.208,"So, most of the creatures in Reeftown don't know many facts about moray eels?"
00:20:22.250,00:20:23.666,Unh-unh. Not really.
00:20:23.708,00:20:26.875,"- Maury, that's it!"
00:20:26.916,00:20:29.791,Yeah! That's your news!
00:20:29.833,00:20:33.500,None of us knew all those facts about moray eels.
00:20:36.333,00:20:42.500,And I think everyone on the reef would love to hear about your great sense of smell and your patience.
00:20:42.541,00:20:45.208,So you do have news to share!
00:20:45.250,00:20:46.791,"Hey, you guys are right!"
00:20:46.833,00:20:49.875,"Well, I'm gonna go tell the whole reef all about it!"
00:20:49.916,00:20:52.458,- Yeah!
00:21:47.708,00:21:49.583,- Oh!
00:22:25.291,00:22:28.458,"Hey, everyone, have you heard?"
00:22:28.500,00:22:33.583,News on the reef is the surprising facts about moray eels.
00:22:33.625,00:22:36.625,- Do tell.
00:22:36.666,00:22:41.625,"Well, moray eels have poor eyesight, but an excellent sense of smell."
00:22:47.791,00:22:49.833,"Plus, moray eels are fantastic pals."
00:22:49.875,00:22:52.166,"Oh, thanks, Denny."
00:22:52.208,00:22:53.958,And that wasn't news to us!
00:22:54.000,00:22:55.875,"- Well done, Maury!"
00:22:55.916,00:22:58.208,"- Right, guys?"
00:01:01.750,00:01:04.625,Whoa! Wow! Wow!
00:01:04.666,00:01:06.791,Wow! Yeah!
00:01:06.833,00:01:08.208,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:01:08.250,00:01:10.125,Oh-oh-oh!
00:01:10.166,00:01:12.041,- Bubbles!
00:01:12.083,00:01:14.375,You are a genius.
00:01:14.416,00:01:17.958,"Why, again?"
00:01:18.000,00:01:25.958,"Because it was your idea to spend our entire day together at Dorsal Park, and this has been the best... day... ever!"
00:01:26.000,00:01:29.125,And the best part is it isn't over yet!
00:01:29.166,00:01:32.791,"We still get to camp under the big, bright bubble!"
00:01:32.833,00:01:36.208,"Yeah, I've already got the perfect campsite picked out."
00:01:36.250,00:01:38.541,- This is gonna be great!
00:01:38.583,00:01:41.875,It's nice to get to spend time with my best friend ever!
00:01:41.916,00:01:44.708,- Absolutely! Whoo!
00:03:21.833,00:03:25.333,"And then-- and then the sea urchin said, Don't be so sharp!"
00:03:31.166,00:03:34.250,It's so beautiful.
00:03:34.291,00:03:38.125,"And all those little sparkles in the sky are beautiful, too."
00:03:38.166,00:03:39.791,And really bright tonight!
00:03:39.833,00:03:42.125,It's late!
00:03:42.166,00:03:43.916,"Yeah, we-- we should probably get some sleep, huh?"
00:03:43.958,00:03:45.416,- Yeah.
00:03:45.458,00:03:48.541,"- Well, good night, Bubbles."
00:03:48.583,00:03:52.708,"Oh, uh, Splash?"
00:03:52.750,00:03:55.250,- Good night.
00:03:59.083,00:04:06.041,"I wish those sparkles weren't so far away, 'cause I'd love to just reach out and... touch 'em."
00:04:09.166,00:04:10.458,- Bubbles! Wake up!
00:04:12.375,00:04:14.625,That you're waking me up in the middle of the night?
00:04:14.666,00:04:16.041,You're right.
00:04:16.083,00:04:19.083,My wish came true!
00:04:19.125,00:04:20.666,All the plankton you could eat?
00:04:20.708,00:04:22.250,Not that wish.
00:04:22.291,00:04:23.708,"Oh, got it."
00:04:23.750,00:04:25.708,Just come and see!
00:04:34.541,00:04:37.250,- Right.
00:04:37.291,00:04:43.666,The sparkles from the sky have fallen into the water and landed right here in Reeftown!
00:04:45.333,00:04:47.208,- Yes!
00:04:49.583,00:04:58.083,"- Wha-- - Yeah, and I can prove it, because in my dreams I can swim super fast, like this!"
00:04:58.125,00:05:01.208,Whoo!
00:05:01.250,00:05:03.291,Look at me go!
00:05:03.333,00:05:05.875,Uh... this isn't a dream.
00:05:05.916,00:05:09.583,"It is real, and I can show you right now!"
00:05:09.625,00:05:13.333,I was right over about here when it happened.
00:05:13.375,00:05:16.208,Prepare... to be...
00:05:16.250,00:05:17.375,amazed.
00:05:17.416,00:05:21.833,Okay...
00:05:21.875,00:05:23.916,Ha! Huh? Huh?
00:05:26.416,00:05:28.333,"- Wha-- - It's okay, Splash."
00:05:28.375,00:05:30.541,I believe you.
00:05:30.583,00:05:36.083,"The sparkles from the sky came down, and now they're back up in the sky again."
00:05:36.125,00:05:38.291,But-- but they were just here.
00:05:38.333,00:05:41.208,Maybe I was in the wrong spot.
00:05:43.250,00:05:45.791,"Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle, ha!"
00:05:48.166,00:05:50.750,"Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle, ha?"
00:05:50.791,00:05:58.791,"Well, if you find them again, Splash, let me know, but I need to get some sleep-- Bubbles!"
00:05:58.833,00:06:00.458,- Look!
00:06:00.500,00:06:03.166,I told you!
00:06:09.583,00:06:13.000,"sparkle, ha!"
00:06:14.208,00:06:17.333,"Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle, ha!"
00:06:17.375,00:06:19.166,- Ha ha!
00:06:21.166,00:06:24.250,We should show these sparkles to Dunk and Ripple!
00:06:26.500,00:06:29.166,"Okay, here we go."
00:06:30.333,00:06:31.791,Oh..
00:06:34.125,00:06:36.000,"Come here, sparkles!"
00:06:34.125,00:06:38.291,You can- Eh... sparkles?
00:06:38.333,00:06:42.875,Yeah. I think this is gonna be harder than we thought.
00:06:44.375,00:06:46.916,"I mean, how hard can it be to grab a few sparkles?"
00:06:46.958,00:06:48.000,Come on.
00:06:48.041,00:06:50.500,"Come here, Sparkles!"
00:06:51.958,00:06:54.041,"- Come here, sparkles!"
00:06:54.083,00:06:56.541,"- Sparkles, everywhere!"
00:06:56.583,00:06:59.541,"- I'm gonna get you, sparkles!"
00:07:02.708,00:07:05.458,Yeah.
00:07:05.500,00:07:10.416,"If we can't take the sparkles with us, then we need to bring Dunk and Ripple here to see them!"
00:07:10.458,00:07:12.208,Good idea.
00:07:10.458,00:07:18.041,"You go and get them, and I'll stay here to make sure those sparkles don't go anywhere."
00:07:18.083,00:07:19.875,I'll be right back!
00:07:19.916,00:07:22.000,Okay.
00:07:22.041,00:07:24.833,"Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle, ha!"
00:07:24.875,00:07:27.833,Meh-meh-meh-meh-meh-meh.
00:07:29.208,00:07:31.166,"Dunk, Dunk, Dunk, Dunk, Dunk, Dunk, Dunk!"
00:07:32.666,00:07:34.375,I have to show you something!
00:07:34.416,00:07:38.041,The sparkles from the sky have fallen into the water!
00:07:38.083,00:07:40.625,Yeah! Bubbles and I are dancing with them!
00:07:40.666,00:07:43.041,Whoo-hoo!
00:07:43.083,00:07:45.083,- Uh...Splash?
00:07:45.125,00:07:46.458,- Yeah.
00:07:46.500,00:07:48.333,I asked the same thing.
00:07:48.375,00:07:49.916,"Apparently, it's not."
00:07:49.958,00:07:52.541,"No, no! C'mon you guys, let's go. Whoo-hoo!"
00:07:52.583,00:07:55.333,- Uh... Sparkles?
00:07:58.083,00:08:00.458,- Feast your eyes on... this!
00:08:00.500,00:08:03.750,"Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle, ha!"
00:08:03.791,00:08:06.083,- Whoa!
00:08:06.125,00:08:08.666,Who knew Bubbles had such great moves?
00:08:08.708,00:08:10.500,"- Ha ha. Yeah, Bubbles-- huh?"
00:08:10.541,00:08:12.375,"- Sparkle, sparkle..."
00:08:12.416,00:08:13.875,"Bubbles, what happened?"
00:08:13.916,00:08:16.958,"I'm sorry, Splash."
00:08:17.000,00:08:21.375,"One minute they were here, and the next minute - they were gone!"
00:08:21.416,00:08:24.250,- Nighttime dance party!
00:08:26.791,00:08:29.375,"- Guys, the dance party's over!"
00:08:29.416,00:08:32.333,sparkle-- huh?
00:08:32.375,00:08:34.958,"So, I don't get it."
00:08:35.000,00:08:37.708,Why did the sparkles come into the water?
00:08:37.750,00:08:45.750,"Like we were saying, I made a wish that I could reach out and touch the sparkles in the sky and then, poof, ha, there they were in the water!"
00:08:45.791,00:08:47.666,Wow!
00:08:47.708,00:08:52.208,"Yeah, the sparkles were pretty special, but they just went home."
00:08:52.250,00:08:54.000,"Well, I wouldn't be so sure of that!"
00:08:54.041,00:08:56.500,- Look! They're back!
00:08:56.541,00:08:59.750,- I knew they'd come back!
00:08:59.791,00:09:02.083,"sparkles, sparkles."
00:09:03.791,00:09:06.625,"If you like that, check this out!"
00:09:06.666,00:09:08.708,"Yeah, go for it, Dunk!"
00:09:08.750,00:09:12.000,"Hey, let's all sparkle together!"
00:09:19.541,00:09:22.416,"Well, I'll be."
00:09:22.458,00:09:25.708,Been a while since I've seen these little guys.
00:09:35.500,00:09:38.333,"Well, yes, you did, but don't worry about it at all."
00:09:38.375,00:09:42.125,I love watching bioluminescent phytoplankton.
00:09:45.208,00:09:47.458,These are the sparkles that fell from the sky.
00:09:53.250,00:09:55.083,"Oh, well, I can see why you think that."
00:09:55.125,00:10:00.750,This phytoplankton is as beautiful - as the sparkles in the sky.
00:10:00.791,00:10:09.708,"What you kids have been dancing with are called dinoflagellates, which are a type of plankton that glow in the dark when the water around is disturbed."
00:10:09.750,00:10:11.583,- Wow!
00:10:11.625,00:10:19.750,"So when we dance around these dinoflagellates, we're making the water all around us move, - which causes them to glow?"
00:10:19.791,00:10:24.083,"Well, if they're all around us, then how come we can't see them when they're not glowing?"
00:10:24.125,00:10:31.166,"They're very, very tiny, and they move around with the currents from place to place, making it glow."
00:10:31.208,00:10:34.625,"Ah! If they move all around us, that explains why we kept losing them!"
00:10:34.666,00:10:36.416,They were traveling with us!
00:10:36.458,00:10:39.208,"Hey, guys, I'm trying to do some nighttime feeding here."
00:10:39.250,00:10:44.916,What's with all this bright li-- What?
00:10:44.958,00:10:47.666,"Hey, Zee! Come check out our dinoflagellates."
00:10:47.708,00:10:50.708,They're the latest thing to hit Reeftown!
00:10:50.750,00:10:54.750,"Actually, Dunk, dinoflagellates have been around for millions of years."
00:10:54.791,00:10:56.458,"Like I said, a timeless classic."
00:10:56.500,00:10:58.208,Come check 'em out!
00:10:58.250,00:11:00.250,Okay! What do I do?
00:11:00.291,00:11:02.500,Whoa! Did you see what my fin just-- Whoa!
00:11:02.541,00:11:04.416,Did you see what my tail-- whoa!
00:11:04.458,00:11:07.166,- So pretty!
00:11:07.208,00:11:10.208,Ah! Uh-- - Splash?
00:11:10.250,00:11:12.375,- You okay?
00:11:12.416,00:11:16.291,"Yeah, I mean, these dinoflagellates are amazing, but, uh..."
00:11:16.333,00:11:19.166,But they're not sparkles from the sky?
00:11:19.208,00:11:25.041,"Yeah. You see, when I thought my wish brought them here, it's just seemed more special, I guess."
00:11:25.083,00:11:31.041,"Well, you know, Splash, these glowing dinoflagellates are known in many places as sea sparkles."
00:11:35.625,00:11:40.750,"Guys, we'd better keep this dance party going before these dinoflagellates move somewhere else."
00:11:40.791,00:11:43.333,I guess you're right.
00:11:43.375,00:11:46.041,Are you kidding?
00:11:46.083,00:11:49.375,Check out these moves!
00:12:02.875,00:12:06.333,Hurry! I can't wait to get to the kelp forest to see our new friend Tyke.
00:12:06.375,00:12:09.625,- Yeah!
00:12:10.791,00:12:13.708,Here we go!
00:12:13.750,00:12:15.791,Hold on to your fins!
00:12:25.125,00:12:27.541,"- Oh, Tyke!"
00:12:29.708,00:12:31.583,"Mess, mess, mess!"
00:12:31.625,00:12:33.166,Nothing new there!
00:12:33.208,00:12:35.833,Plenty of mess in Tidy's algae bed!
00:12:35.875,00:12:37.166,"I heard that, Chipper!"
00:12:37.208,00:12:40.083,"We have this under control, thank you!"
00:12:42.791,00:12:44.916,"- Now, listen, Tyke."
00:12:44.958,00:12:46.333,Making a mess is not funny!
00:12:46.375,00:12:48.666,We've got to keep it clean!
00:12:48.708,00:12:50.666,- Keep it clean!
00:12:50.708,00:12:53.416,"Hey, wait a minute!"
00:12:53.458,00:12:55.333,Personal space!
00:12:55.375,00:12:58.083,- Personal space!
00:12:58.125,00:12:59.750,"Careful, there! Oh!"
00:13:02.750,00:13:05.708,- Don't tell us what?
00:13:05.750,00:13:09.541,"It's okay, Tyke!"
00:13:09.583,00:13:11.541,"Heya, Tidy!"
00:13:11.583,00:13:14.208,"- Ah, tickle, tickle, tickle!"
00:13:14.250,00:13:17.250,Okay! Okay!
00:13:17.291,00:13:22.875,"Today I was trying to get some cleaning done, but my friend Tyke here had other ideas."
00:13:22.916,00:13:24.750,I had other ideas!
00:13:24.791,00:13:30.083,"Oh, if only I could get this algae bed clean and keep it clean like the old days."
00:13:30.125,00:13:32.375,Maybe you shouldn't have had Tyke move in with you.
00:13:33.791,00:13:38.041,"I mean, baby harbor seal pups like Tyke often make their home in the kelp forest."
00:13:38.083,00:13:39.750,There's nothing I can do about it.
00:13:39.791,00:13:42.041,I bet you miss the quiet days.
00:13:42.083,00:13:44.083,"Ah, yes, indeed."
00:13:44.125,00:13:49.416,I just wish Tyke had someplace else to play for a while so I could get some serious cleaning done.
00:13:49.458,00:13:51.791,"Well, maybe we can help."
00:13:54.458,00:13:57.458,"Playtime! Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!"
00:13:57.500,00:13:59.166,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:13:59.208,00:14:01.791,I'll take that as a yes.
00:14:01.833,00:14:03.666,What do you think we should play with Tyke?
00:14:03.708,00:14:08.125,"Well, she seems to really like the game of knocking things over on the algae bed."
00:14:08.166,00:14:11.041,'Course it wasn't a game before she came along!
00:14:11.083,00:14:13.416,Uh... where'd Tyke go?
00:14:13.458,00:14:15.166,"Oh, look!"
00:14:15.208,00:14:16.958,- Here I am!
00:14:17.000,00:14:19.666,Tyke's thought of the perfect game for us to play.
00:14:19.708,00:14:22.458,- Hide and seek!
00:14:19.708,00:14:24.375,"- Look, she's already hiding and popping out from behind that rock."
00:14:24.416,00:14:25.541,- Yeah!
00:14:25.583,00:14:28.625,Hide and seek. Perfect!
00:14:28.666,00:14:30.583,Why didn't I think of that?
00:14:30.625,00:14:35.375,"When she's hiding in the kelp forest, she won't be anywhere near my precious algae bed!"
00:14:35.416,00:14:37.500,"Hide and seek it is, then."
00:14:37.541,00:14:40.583,Not a moment too soon if you ask me!
00:14:40.625,00:14:43.666,"Heya, Tyke! Let's go!"
00:14:43.708,00:14:46.750,Hide and seek?
00:14:46.791,00:14:49.583,"- All right, then."
00:14:49.625,00:14:51.458,- Okay!
00:14:51.500,00:14:52.791,- Or by next week!
00:14:52.833,00:14:55.166,Or whenever you're ready.
00:14:55.208,00:14:58.375,No rush at all!
00:14:58.416,00:15:02.375,"Okay, so here are the rules for hide and seek."
00:15:04.250,00:15:05.833,"I'm gonna close my eyes, like this."
00:15:05.875,00:15:07.500,- Got it.
00:15:07.541,00:15:10.083,"And then when I open them, I'm gonna come find you!"
00:15:10.125,00:15:13.041,Got it? Uh ...Tyke?
00:15:13.083,00:15:16.000,Uh... whoa!
00:15:16.041,00:15:17.625,"Well, where is she?"
00:15:17.666,00:15:19.791,I was still explaining hide and seek.
00:15:19.833,00:15:23.875,"Well, I think she started the hiding part without us."
00:15:26.916,00:15:29.833,I don't see her anywhere.
00:15:29.875,00:15:32.625,- Tyke?
00:15:32.666,00:15:34.541,Do you think she knows where to find us again?
00:15:34.583,00:15:37.583,I don't know.
00:15:37.625,00:15:39.125,But she's still young.
00:15:42.291,00:15:44.000,Maybe she went back to see Tidy.
00:15:44.041,00:15:46.041,"Hey, everyone!"
00:15:46.083,00:15:47.583,Thanks for playing with Tyke!
00:15:47.625,00:15:50.583,I'm getting so much cleaning done! Yay-hee!
00:15:50.625,00:15:52.500,Tidy thinks Tyke is with us!
00:15:55.416,00:15:58.541,We've gotta find her.
00:15:58.583,00:16:01.708,Finding Tyke is now our Reeftown Rangers mission!
00:16:01.750,00:16:03.375,- Come on!
00:16:54.166,00:16:55.833,Come on!
00:17:22.541,00:17:26.208,Let's go!
00:17:36.666,00:17:39.416,"Okay, we've got a plan to find Tyke."
00:17:39.458,00:17:41.500,Bubbles and I will go out into the ocean.
00:17:41.541,00:17:44.291,And Ripple and I will check the kelp blades here.
00:17:44.333,00:17:46.791,Good idea.
00:17:46.833,00:17:49.791,But the Reeftown Rangers are on the case!
00:17:49.833,00:17:51.750,- Yeah!
00:17:51.791,00:17:54.291,"Ahh, I tell ya."
00:17:54.333,00:17:58.333,"A place for everything, and everything in its place."
00:17:58.375,00:18:01.791,Finally.
00:18:01.833,00:18:04.708,And no one around to mess it up.
00:18:04.750,00:18:08.583,"Oh, I love it, it's perfect."
00:18:08.625,00:18:11.500,Oh.
00:18:19.875,00:18:21.333,Maybe she's up there.
00:18:25.833,00:18:28.125,Hello? Who's there?
00:18:28.166,00:18:32.500,"Uh ...is that you, Tyke?"
00:18:32.541,00:18:35.083,Ah! Tyke? Tyke?
00:18:32.541,00:18:39.166,Did you say Tyke? Oh-- Tidy!
00:18:39.208,00:18:45.000,"Oh, uh, well, I, uh, I just wanted to, uh, check and see how you're doing with Tyke, yeah, that's it."
00:18:45.041,00:18:50.083,"Uh, well, she's fine..."
00:18:50.125,00:18:52.875,"Why, were you checking up on her?"
00:18:55.500,00:18:58.208,Of course not.
00:18:58.250,00:19:00.625,"I was just in the area, and I thought she might be here."
00:19:00.666,00:19:02.833,"So, uh, where is she?"
00:19:02.875,00:19:05.375,"Uh, let's just say..."
00:19:05.416,00:19:06.583,Hmm?
00:19:06.625,00:19:09.083,she's really good at hide and seek.
00:19:09.125,00:19:10.583,"Uh, we can't find her."
00:19:10.625,00:19:13.000,You can't find her.
00:19:13.041,00:19:16.166,You can't find her?!
00:19:16.208,00:19:19.875,"Oh, no!"
00:19:19.916,00:19:22.000,Don't worry.
00:19:22.041,00:19:24.291,Worry? Why would you think I was worrying?
00:19:24.333,00:19:27.125,I'm not worried at all.
00:19:27.166,00:19:29.958,I'm just gonna go look for her in a non-worried way!
00:19:30.000,00:19:32.625,"Oh, he is very worried."
00:19:32.666,00:19:36.083,- Oh! Ohh...
00:19:36.125,00:19:38.791,Do you think Tyke would've gone this far?
00:19:38.833,00:19:40.875,"Oh, I don't know..."
00:19:40.916,00:19:45.875,Hey-ey! There are my adventurous Reeftown Rangers!
00:19:45.916,00:19:47.250,"- Hi, Flo!"
00:19:52.791,00:19:54.875,Seems like you're looking for something.
00:19:54.916,00:19:57.375,We were playing hide and seek with Tyke.
00:19:57.416,00:20:02.000,"Yeah, and now she's hide-and-seeking somewhere, and, uh, we can't find her!"
00:20:02.041,00:20:04.458,Uh... isn't that the point of hide and seek?
00:20:04.500,00:20:09.833,"Yes, but... what if she's too young to be on her own?"
00:20:09.875,00:20:13.166,Young harbor seals are very independent.
00:20:13.208,00:20:19.416,Ha. I'm sure you've already noticed how curious they are and love to explore.
00:20:19.458,00:20:21.583,- Definitely!
00:20:21.625,00:20:25.125,"So you're saying she could be off anywhere, exploring?"
00:20:25.166,00:20:32.541,"Except harbor seal pups would not want to explore far from their home, not unless their family and friends were nearby."
00:20:32.583,00:20:36.083,I guess Tidy is kind of her friend and family.
00:20:36.125,00:20:38.750,"Hey, Bubbles, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
00:20:38.791,00:20:42.750,Have you looked back to where Tyke feels most at home?
00:20:42.791,00:20:45.125,- That's what I'm thinking!
00:20:45.166,00:20:47.541,"- Come on, Splash!"
00:20:47.583,00:20:52.000,Sure thing. You're welcome!
00:20:52.041,00:20:54.708,Tidy! Wait up!
00:20:54.750,00:20:58.708,"I don't get it, I thought you'd be glad Tyke was gone playing hide and seek."
00:20:58.750,00:21:02.166,Yeah. Didn't you want your algae bed clean and quiet?
00:21:10.666,00:21:13.166,Well... Tyke is so curious about everything.
00:21:13.208,00:21:16.958,"I mean, she makes me look at the kelp forest in a different light."
00:21:17.000,00:21:20.333,"You know, she really appreciates living here."
00:21:20.375,00:21:22.958,"Huh, I never thought about it that way."
00:21:23.000,00:21:25.458,"Well, neither did I until Tyke showed up."
00:21:25.500,00:21:27.375,So you miss her!
00:21:27.416,00:21:29.791,"Well, I didn't say that!"
00:21:29.833,00:21:31.875,"Well, uh..."
00:21:31.916,00:21:34.125,all I know is we have to find her.
00:21:34.166,00:21:39.250,"Oh, this is all my fault for letting her go out and play hide and seek."
00:21:39.291,00:21:40.875,"Don't worry, Tidy."
00:21:40.916,00:21:44.250,The Reeftown Rangers are on the job.
00:21:47.041,00:21:54.041,"Yeah, Flo says that even though harbor seals are really independent, they still like to stay close to their home and family."
00:21:54.083,00:21:58.583,"Well, that's great, because Tidy here really wants to find her."
00:21:58.625,00:22:00.500,You do?
00:22:00.541,00:22:05.291,"Well, I-I..."
00:22:05.333,00:22:07.041,Oh!
00:22:07.083,00:22:08.875,He misses her a lot.
00:22:18.125,00:22:23.500,What's this huge mess on my nice clean algae bed?
00:22:23.541,00:22:25.416,- Ta-da!
00:22:25.458,00:22:28.291,- I was hiding!
00:22:28.333,00:22:31.375,Aww.
00:22:31.416,00:22:33.125,I'm a good hider.
00:22:33.166,00:22:35.375,You really missed Tyke a lot.
00:22:35.416,00:22:37.875,Let's not go too far.
00:22:37.916,00:22:39.833,Harbor seal pups are a lot of work.
00:22:45.208,00:22:47.125,Oh! Oh!
00:22:47.166,00:22:49.583,Personal space!
00:22:49.625,00:22:52.000,"Oh, Tyke, I love you!"
00:22:52.041,00:22:55.375,We heard that!
00:22:55.416,00:22:56.958,"- Yeah, you did!"
00:01:05.666,00:01:07.833,"Oh, wait!"
00:01:07.875,00:01:09.500,"One, two..."
00:01:09.541,00:01:11.916,- Surprise!
00:01:11.958,00:01:15.041,"Oh, you're so good at this game, Bubbles."
00:01:15.083,00:01:17.208,"Okay, okay, okay, my turn, my turn, my turn."
00:01:17.250,00:01:19.375,"Oh, boy! Oh, boy!"
00:01:19.416,00:01:22.166,You know you have to keep really still to surprise us.
00:01:22.208,00:01:24.916,"Well, I know, but I can do it."
00:01:24.958,00:01:26.583,Watch.
00:01:26.625,00:01:28.708,And... still.
00:01:31.416,00:01:32.625,You're moving.
00:01:32.666,00:01:35.041,Because I have an itch on my nose.
00:01:36.708,00:01:40.625,"Okay, that's better."
00:01:40.666,00:01:42.250,St-- hey.
00:01:42.291,00:01:44.083,Is that Gush?
00:01:45.791,00:01:48.708,"Nice try, but you moved again."
00:01:48.750,00:01:50.666,"No, no, really, really."
00:01:50.708,00:01:52.541,Maybe he's here to play with us.
00:01:52.583,00:01:55.333,Wow!
00:01:55.375,00:01:59.541,"You know, he'd be great at surprise fish."
00:01:59.583,00:02:01.166,"- Come on, let's go see."
00:02:01.208,00:02:03.000,- All right.
00:02:04.125,00:02:05.625,Boo!
00:02:04.125,00:02:08.625,"We knew it was you, even with your camouflage."
00:02:08.666,00:02:10.041,"Oh, hi."
00:02:10.083,00:02:13.500,"Oh, uh, you don't sound like yourself today."
00:02:13.541,00:02:15.958,I don't?
00:02:16.000,00:02:18.458,"Well, your voice sounds different."
00:02:18.500,00:02:22.958,"Yeah, do you have a frog in your throat or something?"
00:02:23.000,00:02:27.041,Because you're a frogfish!
00:02:27.083,00:02:29.166,"Oh, yeah!"
00:02:29.208,00:02:33.208,"That's really funny, because I am a frogfish."
00:02:33.250,00:02:34.958,"Of course you are, Gush."
00:02:38.583,00:02:39.791,- What?
00:02:39.833,00:02:41.333,I'm Wart.
00:02:44.041,00:02:46.000,Now I'm back for a visit.
00:02:46.041,00:02:47.041,Wow!
00:02:47.083,00:02:49.083,You're so much like Gush!
00:02:49.125,00:02:51.875,Yeah!
00:02:51.916,00:02:55.000,"Oh, that's exactly why I came here, to meet Gush."
00:02:57.875,00:03:00.541,Wait.
00:03:03.750,00:03:06.125,Yeah! Where have you been all this time?
00:03:06.166,00:03:08.041,We've never seen you before.
00:03:08.083,00:03:10.291,"Oh, I haven't been back to Reeftown since I was little."
00:03:10.333,00:03:13.041,- I grew up on my own.
00:03:13.083,00:03:15.666,"- Well, who took care of you?"
00:03:15.708,00:03:18.000,"Well, frogfish are very independent."
00:03:18.041,00:03:20.125,We take care of ourselves.
00:03:20.166,00:03:23.708,Let's go find Gush.
00:03:23.750,00:03:25.500,- Yeah!
00:03:25.541,00:03:27.000,- Come on!
00:03:30.041,00:03:32.000,Gush?
00:03:32.041,00:03:34.458,- Are you here?
00:03:34.500,00:03:36.500,- Where?
00:03:37.916,00:03:40.208,"- Wait, oh. Oh!"
00:03:41.625,00:03:43.708,"Oh, boy."
00:03:43.750,00:03:46.833,We couldn't tell if it was you or the coral we were staring at.
00:03:46.875,00:03:49.000,We have something very important to tell you.
00:03:49.041,00:03:51.041,- Oh.
00:03:51.083,00:03:53.958,- Huh?
00:03:54.000,00:03:55.833,"Oh, another handsome frogfish."
00:03:55.875,00:03:58.416,"Uh, wait."
00:03:58.458,00:04:01.500,Wart!
00:04:01.541,00:04:03.958,"- Hiya, Pop."
00:04:04.000,00:04:07.333,I haven't seen you since you were just a little larva.
00:04:07.375,00:04:10.041,You have really grown since then.
00:04:10.083,00:04:13.708,He's the same size as you.
00:04:13.750,00:04:16.000,"Well, you're still my Pop, though."
00:04:16.041,00:04:18.333,Aww.
00:04:22.125,00:04:25.166,"Or, uh, you want to know the best places to catch lunch?"
00:04:25.208,00:04:27.416,"Oh, I just wanted to visit for a day."
00:04:27.458,00:04:30.250,I'm so glad you're still living here in the same place.
00:04:30.291,00:04:32.500,- You look happy.
00:04:30.291,00:04:34.875,"- Well, even happier now that you've come back to see me."
00:04:34.916,00:04:36.833,"Aww, thanks, Pop."
00:04:36.875,00:04:43.750,"All right, so since you're back for a visit, how about I teach you how to do all the things frogfish do in Reeftown?"
00:04:51.791,00:04:54.125,Sounds great.
00:04:54.166,00:04:56.541,"Okay, kids, gather round."
00:04:56.583,00:05:01.541,"Now, catching food is all about blending in so that the food doesn't see you first."
00:05:01.583,00:05:03.500,It's called camouflage.
00:05:03.541,00:05:10.416,"And what you do is you get in front of a background-- Oh, uh... like this?"
00:05:10.458,00:05:12.083,- Uh...
00:05:12.125,00:05:14.708,"Well, yeah, sort of."
00:05:14.750,00:05:17.166,"Yeah, actually, exactly like that."
00:05:18.833,00:05:22.291,It's amazing!
00:05:22.333,00:05:25.666,"Well, uh, that's pretty good for a first try."
00:05:25.708,00:05:28.416,But it takes a lot of practice.
00:05:28.458,00:05:30.458,Can you teach me how to do that?
00:05:33.333,00:05:37.208,"Oh, Dunk, you have something else you can do very well."
00:05:40.750,00:05:44.166,Really? You think this is as good as camouflage?
00:05:44.208,00:05:46.250,It's really special.
00:05:46.291,00:05:47.458,"And you know what else, Dunk?"
00:05:47.500,00:05:49.458,It's something special about you.
00:05:49.500,00:05:51.083,That's something to celebrate.
00:05:51.125,00:05:55.375,"I am pretty special, aren't I?"
00:05:55.416,00:05:59.083,"That was nice of you, Pop."
00:05:59.125,00:06:02.750,Yeah! That's why we always go to Gush for advice.
00:06:05.875,00:06:08.541,"Okay, Wart, you ready for the next lesson?"
00:06:08.583,00:06:10.458,"Sure thing, Pop."
00:06:10.500,00:06:16.958,"Lesson two-- stillness, the most important part of being a frogfish."
00:06:17.000,00:06:18.083,That's true.
00:06:18.125,00:06:21.625,You have to be very still to sit and wait for food to come along.
00:06:21.666,00:06:23.875,- Right.
00:06:29.041,00:06:31.125,I always move.
00:06:31.166,00:06:33.458,"Oh, we'll show you together."
00:06:33.500,00:06:35.375,- Okay.
00:06:33.500,00:06:37.250,"- Now, you have to pretend you're not a fish."
00:06:41.458,00:06:43.166,"Oh, like this?"
00:06:45.500,00:06:47.041,"Well, I'll tell you what, Splash."
00:06:47.083,00:06:52.250,"You are the most still yellowback fusilier I've ever seen, honestly!"
00:06:52.291,00:06:54.875,Yay! Woo-hoo! Yeah!
00:06:54.916,00:06:56.875,"Gush, you're such a great teacher."
00:06:56.916,00:06:59.333,"Okay, come on now."
00:06:59.375,00:07:01.416,Back to the stillness lesson.
00:07:01.458,00:07:03.708,"Sure thing, Pop."
00:07:03.750,00:07:08.125,"You, uh, sit here and, uh, just wait..."
00:07:09.333,00:07:11.916,- For food.
00:07:14.833,00:07:19.000,"I should mention, the thing with catching food - is, you really need to wait-- - Oh, excuse me."
00:07:19.041,00:07:20.916,For just the right... time.
00:07:20.958,00:07:22.916,"- Ah, got it."
00:07:22.958,00:07:25.791,"Wow! You're really good at this, Wart!"
00:07:25.833,00:07:28.583,"Thanks, but, uh, Pop here is the master."
00:07:28.625,00:07:30.791,"Yeah, he's the best."
00:07:30.833,00:07:38.083,"He helps me with being patient with my 499 brothers all the time, - and they're never still."
00:07:38.125,00:07:40.583,"Well, thanks, Ripple."
00:07:40.625,00:07:43.125,"Okay, you ready for lesson three, son?"
00:07:43.166,00:07:45.541,Sure.
00:07:45.583,00:07:49.833,"Ooh, actually, I might only have two lessons after all."
00:07:51.416,00:07:53.291,"Well, what about the obstacle course?"
00:07:55.375,00:07:59.375,You don't know about Golden Legs Gush?
00:07:59.416,00:08:00.750,Golden Legs?
00:08:05.791,00:08:08.833,He's still going!
00:08:08.875,00:08:11.333,- Yeah!
00:08:11.375,00:08:13.583,"- All right, Gush!"
00:08:13.625,00:08:16.416,- This is my favorite part!
00:08:16.458,00:08:19.875,He can beat all of us in a race through the obstacle course.
00:08:19.916,00:08:23.166,Wow. I never knew my Pop was so graceful.
00:08:25.250,00:08:29.000,"Oh, he loves a challenge!"
00:08:29.041,00:08:30.708,And I love that about him.
00:08:30.750,00:08:33.291,We all do.
00:08:33.333,00:08:36.625,"Ha! Come on, Wart."
00:08:36.666,00:08:38.250,- That was amazing!
00:08:38.291,00:08:39.625,- Yeah!
00:08:39.666,00:08:41.291,- That was amazing!
00:08:41.333,00:08:44.041,"All right, go ahead, son."
00:08:46.166,00:08:47.500,- Good luck.
00:08:47.541,00:08:49.208,"- You can do it, Wart."
00:08:49.250,00:08:50.500,- Go like your Pop!
00:08:57.166,00:08:58.916,"What's wrong, Gush?"
00:08:58.958,00:09:05.291,"I'm so happy to have my son here, but, uh..."
00:09:05.333,00:09:08.250,"What do you mean, Pop?"
00:09:10.375,00:09:12.041,"Well, how can you say that, Wart?"
00:09:12.083,00:09:13.708,I couldn't teach you anything.
00:09:13.750,00:09:20.375,"You're already good at camouflage, and you're good on stillness, and you're a great food catcher."
00:09:20.416,00:09:23.708,"Yeah, but what about all the things you taught these guys?"
00:09:23.750,00:09:25.916,What?
00:09:25.958,00:09:29.416,"Just today, you taught me that I'm special because I can puff up."
00:09:29.458,00:09:33.583,"Yeah, and you've taught me to be patient with all my brothers."
00:09:33.625,00:09:37.708,And you showed me that you can get through any obstacle if you never give up.
00:09:37.750,00:09:40.125,And you taught me how to be perfectly still.
00:09:40.166,00:09:41.875,Ha!
00:09:41.916,00:09:44.500,I'm still working on that one.
00:09:48.958,00:09:56.208,"Even though I can do so many things for myself, I still love having a dad."
00:09:56.250,00:09:58.666,"Aw, thanks, son."
00:09:58.708,00:10:01.250,And I sure am glad we have you here to teach us.
00:10:01.291,00:10:04.625,I learned so many amazing things about frogfish today.
00:10:04.666,00:10:06.625,Yeah! It's incredible.
00:10:06.666,00:10:09.875,There's so much we never knew about you.
00:10:09.916,00:10:11.500,Yeah!
00:11:46.166,00:11:49.083,"Hey, hey, watch me, Gush."
00:11:49.125,00:11:50.416,Uh...
00:11:50.458,00:11:51.708,I taught him everything he knows.
00:12:03.875,00:12:08.833,"Ahh, nothing like the cool, crisp morning water to start a day."
00:12:08.875,00:12:11.166,- Oh.
00:12:11.208,00:12:13.208,"Ripple, my little mija."
00:12:13.250,00:12:15.833,"Papa, do you want to come and swim with me for a second?"
00:12:15.875,00:12:19.208,It's so peaceful here in the morning.
00:12:25.041,00:12:28.416,- Don't you mean 501?
00:12:28.458,00:12:30.208,"Well, you have to eat, too, right?"
00:12:30.250,00:12:32.416,"for thinking about me, sweetie."
00:12:32.458,00:12:38.333,But I'm usually so busy feeding your brothers and cleaning up that I barely have time to eat in the morning.
00:12:38.375,00:12:41.166,You skip breakfast?
00:12:41.208,00:12:43.750,I can barely go a few minutes without eating.
00:12:43.791,00:12:45.250,How do you do it?
00:12:45.291,00:12:47.958,"Believe me, it's part of being a dad."
00:12:49.708,00:12:52.791,- Really?
00:13:03.458,00:13:05.541,"Aw, thank you, Papa."
00:13:05.583,00:13:09.875,"So, uh, we're all cleaned up."
00:13:09.916,00:13:11.958,We're having my favorite this morning.
00:13:12.000,00:13:13.541,Mysid shrimp.
00:13:13.583,00:13:15.250,Ooh! Yum!
00:13:19.541,00:13:26.916,"The only problem is, mysid shrimp are also the boys' favorite, so there probably won't be any left, but don't worry."
00:13:26.958,00:13:29.458,I'll grab a bit here and there when I can.
00:13:29.500,00:13:35.000,and I are so lucky to have such a good Papa.
00:13:38.375,00:13:43.083,"Okay, boys."
00:13:53.791,00:13:55.750,"Did you get enough, 396?"
00:13:55.791,00:13:57.833,"Uh, how's the mysid shrimp, 128?"
00:13:57.875,00:14:01.416,Papa! Papa!
00:14:01.458,00:14:03.500,"- W-what is it, sweetie?"
00:14:01.458,00:14:05.166,"- Oh, well, it's-- - Dad! Dad! I need you!"
00:14:05.208,00:14:07.333,- What did you want to say?
00:14:07.375,00:14:10.541,- Go find out what 338 needs. - I'll be back in one minute.
00:14:10.583,00:14:12.541,Daddy! Daddy!
00:14:12.583,00:14:14.458,"Uh, better make it two minutes."
00:14:24.791,00:14:32.916,"I had no idea he works so hard to give me and my brothers everything we need, and he never asks for anything in return."
00:14:32.958,00:14:37.666,"Well, the least I can do is show him how much I love and appreciate him."
00:14:37.708,00:14:44.250,"It may not be much, but even a little gesture can make a big difference."
00:15:52.208,00:15:54.708,"- Hey, Ripple."
00:15:54.750,00:15:58.083,"- Hey, is everything okay?"
00:15:58.125,00:16:05.166,I've just noticed that my Papa does so much for me and my brothers and doesn't really get anything in return.
00:16:05.208,00:16:09.000,"So, today, I want to do something special for my Papa."
00:16:10.250,00:16:11.416,So what are you gonna do for him?
00:16:11.458,00:16:13.000,- Yeah.
00:16:13.041,00:16:17.375,"My Papa never actually does anything for himself, so I don't know what he likes."
00:16:17.416,00:16:22.083,"Well, uh, maybe we can watch your dad for the day and see if we can find out what he likes."
00:16:22.125,00:16:25.041,"- Great idea, guys!"
00:16:25.083,00:16:28.333,Operation Happy Papa begins now!
00:16:28.375,00:16:29.916,- Yeah!
00:16:29.958,00:16:32.125,"All right, let's go this way!"
00:16:32.166,00:16:34.541,- Yeah!
00:16:34.583,00:16:38.916,"Okay, boys!"
00:16:38.958,00:16:41.208,"- Oh, yeah!"
00:16:41.250,00:16:42.875,You guys don't wanna do that.
00:16:42.916,00:16:45.958,"- Just, uh, give it a second."
00:16:51.625,00:16:53.708,"Boys, you're gonna have to share your shell!"
00:16:53.750,00:16:55.750,"- Like-- okay, good."
00:16:55.791,00:16:57.791,"Well, we can go now."
00:16:57.833,00:17:01.041,"Uh, Ripple, your brothers are, uh..."
00:17:05.916,00:17:09.583,"Yeah, well, when you get a few boys together, they play a lot."
00:17:12.916,00:17:17.250,"You get 499 boys together, you get this."
00:17:17.291,00:17:19.625,Hold on! Hold on!
00:17:21.041,00:17:23.083,We don't need to watch my Papa at all!
00:17:23.125,00:17:25.458,- I know exactly what he needs!
00:17:25.500,00:17:31.333,"Well, he's so busy taking care of all of his little seahorses that he never has a moment for himself."
00:17:31.375,00:17:33.125,"Guys, please!"
00:17:33.166,00:17:37.041,"So, I'm gonna make today all about making my Papa happy!"
00:17:37.083,00:17:39.208,"Ripple, that's a great idea!"
00:17:39.250,00:17:42.666,I think a little rest and relaxation would be perfect for your dad.
00:17:42.708,00:17:47.208,"If there's anything we can do to help, - we're here for you."
00:17:47.250,00:17:51.625,I need you to stay with my brothers and make sure they're fed while I take my Papa out.
00:17:51.666,00:17:54.583,- Uh...
00:17:57.500,00:17:59.375,"Uh, did I say anything?"
00:17:59.416,00:18:02.500,- What I meant was-- - We'd love to.
00:18:09.083,00:18:11.625,Uh... w-we'll be fine.
00:18:11.666,00:18:12.958,You go have a good time.
00:18:13.000,00:18:15.333,Thank you!
00:18:19.166,00:18:25.458,"Hey there, Mr. Charlie-- I mean, uh, Mr. Ripple-- I mean, uh, Mr. Ripple's Dad."
00:18:25.500,00:18:27.250,"Hey, kids."
00:18:27.291,00:18:31.708,"No, the real question is, what can we do for you?"
00:18:31.750,00:18:33.041,That's right!
00:18:33.083,00:18:35.750,We're here to watch the boys for you.
00:18:35.791,00:18:38.583,Ripple has a special day planned just for you.
00:18:38.625,00:18:42.125,- A day... for me?
00:18:42.166,00:18:44.166,You work so hard for me and the boys.
00:18:44.208,00:18:47.291,It's about time you had a day just for you.
00:18:47.333,00:18:49.000,"Well, thanks, kids."
00:18:49.041,00:18:51.458,"I don't know what to say, or what to do, for that matter."
00:18:51.500,00:18:58.083,It's been so long since I've had a day to do what I want to do that I don't even remember what I like to do.
00:18:58.125,00:18:59.958,- Leave that to me.
00:19:00.000,00:19:02.000,- Come on!
00:19:02.041,00:19:03.166,"Thanks again, guys!"
00:19:03.208,00:19:04.375,Have a good time!
00:19:04.416,00:19:06.666,- Have fun!
00:19:08.625,00:19:10.750,And-- and what is this I'm doing now?
00:19:10.791,00:19:13.333,Ooh!
00:19:10.791,00:19:15.083,You're getting a mud bath with a starfish wrap.
00:19:15.125,00:19:17.625,"Oh, and-- and it does what again, mija?"
00:19:17.666,00:19:19.666,"Oh, it's the latest thing!"
00:19:19.708,00:19:25.458,"Bubbles told me it's very relaxing, so I thought it was a great way to start your day."
00:19:25.500,00:19:28.000,Do you feel more relaxed?
00:19:28.041,00:19:30.125,"Y-you know, I-I think I do."
00:19:30.166,00:19:33.083,"Yes, I am relaxed now."
00:19:35.333,00:19:38.041,We have all day if you want to relax some more.
00:19:40.375,00:19:43.791,I-I think maybe it's time for some father-daughter fun!
00:19:43.833,00:19:47.500,- Huh? What do you say?
00:19:47.541,00:19:49.458,- Yeah!
00:19:49.500,00:19:51.916,"Now, how do I get out of this stuff?"
00:19:51.958,00:19:55.500,"Oh, I honestly don't know."
00:19:55.541,00:19:59.208,"Uh, this could take a while."
00:19:59.250,00:20:02.333,"Ready or not, here I come!"
00:20:02.375,00:20:04.583,Whoa!
00:20:06.208,00:20:09.666,I heard that.
00:20:09.708,00:20:11.833,Are you here?
00:20:11.875,00:20:13.916,"Oh, he'll never find me."
00:20:13.958,00:20:15.833,I have such a good hiding spot.
00:20:17.708,00:20:20.416,"- Now, where did she go?"
00:20:20.458,00:20:23.458,I think maybe she's just too good a hider for me.
00:20:23.500,00:20:29.333,Maybe-- maybe I'll go over by these mushroom corals and-- Ha ha!
00:20:29.375,00:20:31.416,"- I got you, Papa!"
00:20:31.458,00:20:34.916,"You sure did, mija!"
00:20:34.958,00:20:39.666,"Well, if you think that was a surprise, wait until you see what's next."
00:20:55.000,00:20:57.458,"Oh, no, Papa!"
00:20:57.500,00:20:58.625,Are you kidding?
00:20:58.666,00:21:00.666,Never better!
00:21:00.708,00:21:02.458,We should probably be heading back.
00:21:02.500,00:21:04.041,Your brothers need to eat dinner.
00:21:04.083,00:21:06.833,"Oh, actually, your day isn't over just yet."
00:21:10.083,00:21:12.166,- Just for me?
00:21:10.083,00:21:17.541,"- Oh, besides, I'm sure my friends have the boys' dinner - all taken care of."
00:21:19.083,00:21:20.250,Nothing.
00:21:26.166,00:21:29.166,"Whoa, uh, how many do we still have left to feed?"
00:21:29.208,00:21:30.833,I have no idea!
00:21:30.875,00:21:33.333,Just keep feeding them till they stop asking for food!
00:21:33.375,00:21:34.958,"- Good plan, okay."
00:21:38.541,00:21:41.000,"Oh, boy."
00:21:47.041,00:21:54.166,And I can't remember the last time I could actually relax and enjoy my food! Gracias!
00:21:54.208,00:21:56.583,"Oh, well, that's what today is all about."
00:21:56.625,00:22:01.583,it's my way of thanking you for giving up so much for me and the boys.
00:22:01.625,00:22:03.500,"Uh, what do you mean?"
00:22:03.541,00:22:11.416,"Well, I just wanted to give you a day where you could get away from having to do everything for us kids and just relax and enjoy yourself."
00:22:11.458,00:22:14.083,"Oh, mija, is-- is that what you think?"
00:22:14.125,00:22:17.333,That I don't enjoy myself being a father?
00:22:17.375,00:22:26.416,"Since I first carried you and your brothers in my brooding pouch, every day has been better than the last."
00:22:30.208,00:22:40.041,"Ripple, I didn't go with you today to get away from my chores, I went so that I could spend the day alone with my favorite girl."
00:22:40.083,00:22:42.750,- Aww.
00:22:40.083,00:22:44.375,"- So, thank you, again, for this wonderful gift."
00:22:44.416,00:22:46.875,- Papa?
00:22:46.916,00:22:50.083,"You know I'm your only girl, right?"
00:22:51.666,00:22:53.583,Still my favorite.
00:22:53.625,00:22:56.333,Aww!
00:22:56.375,00:22:57.625,Mmm!
00:01:00.791,00:01:04.125,- Tidy!
00:01:04.166,00:01:05.666,- I don't know.
00:01:05.708,00:01:08.000,"How about we stay away from that pile, huh?"
00:01:08.041,00:01:09.958,Looks like we found Tidy.
00:01:10.000,00:01:12.250,"Yeah, but who's he talking to?"
00:01:12.291,00:01:14.500,Okay.
00:01:14.541,00:01:17.500,I'm almost done cleaning it all up... again!
00:01:20.041,00:01:23.083,"- Hi, Tidy!"
00:01:23.125,00:01:27.125,"Oh! Splash, Bubbles."
00:01:27.166,00:01:29.000,"Is someone here, Tidy?"
00:01:29.041,00:01:31.291,"Uh, you could say that."
00:01:31.333,00:01:33.250,"Well, who were you talking to, Tidy?"
00:01:33.291,00:01:36.250,"Well, uh-- - Hello!"
00:01:36.291,00:01:39.541,Who is this little cutie?
00:01:43.041,00:01:44.916,She's a harbor seal pup.
00:01:44.958,00:01:47.125,Yay! New friends!
00:01:48.416,00:01:50.791,- What is she doing?
00:01:50.833,00:01:52.916,"Oh, she's nuzzling you with her whiskers."
00:01:55.958,00:01:58.916,"She's certainly very, uh..."
00:01:58.958,00:02:01.333,"Okay, Tyke, remember what Tidy said."
00:02:01.375,00:02:05.541,Not everyone likes to be looked at so closely.
00:02:05.583,00:02:08.708,Aww! She's so cute!
00:02:08.750,00:02:09.958,Yeah.
00:02:10.000,00:02:13.000,"Ooh, pretty colors!"
00:02:13.041,00:02:16.125,"Aw, thanks, pal-- whoa!"
00:02:19.166,00:02:20.416,What kind of a fish is she?
00:02:20.458,00:02:21.916,"Actually, she's not a fish at all."
00:02:21.958,00:02:24.666,She's a mammal.
00:02:24.708,00:02:26.541,"She's warm-blooded, and she breathes air."
00:02:30.166,00:02:32.666,"Yep, she's here."
00:02:32.708,00:02:35.125,She's kind of all over the place.
00:02:35.166,00:02:36.541,Sounds fun!
00:02:36.583,00:02:38.833,"You must love having her around, right, Tidy?"
00:02:40.541,00:02:45.791,"I love having a new friend here, but keeping things neat and clean around here is a bit harder."
00:02:45.833,00:02:50.208,"you have an excuse for that messy algae bed, Tidy!"
00:02:51.500,00:02:53.625,"Nobody asked for your opinion, Chipper!"
00:02:55.166,00:02:58.208,"Oh, this seal pup is hard to keep up with."
00:02:58.250,00:02:59.750,Because she's really fast?
00:02:59.791,00:03:05.666,"Not exactly, she moves quickly, that's for sure, but she's not exactly a-- - Tidy!"
00:03:07.750,00:03:09.916,"Okay, okay."
00:03:09.958,00:03:12.166,"Now, remember what Tidy asked you."
00:03:12.208,00:03:16.208,Not too close to the face.
00:03:16.250,00:03:17.583,"Yay, personal space!"
00:03:17.625,00:03:19.875,- Whoa-ah-whoa!
00:03:19.916,00:03:22.041,Is she okay?
00:03:27.541,00:03:32.875,"Lots of harbor seals come through the kelp forest, but Tyke is the only one who keeps coming back day after day."
00:03:32.916,00:03:35.041,Huh.
00:03:37.375,00:03:39.833,"Yeah, she likes spending time with you."
00:03:39.875,00:03:42.416,Aww. Well.
00:03:42.458,00:03:43.958,I suppose she is very playful.
00:03:44.000,00:03:47.750,"But, well, she sure can- - Whee!"
00:03:47.791,00:03:49.208,"Oh, dear, Tyke!"
00:03:49.250,00:03:52.625,Not my pebble pile!
00:03:54.125,00:03:56.625,"Wow, looks like Tidy needs our help."
00:03:56.666,00:03:58.000,- Yeah.
00:03:58.041,00:03:59.083,"Um, hmm."
00:03:59.125,00:04:00.125,Hey!
00:04:01.541,00:04:04.125,"Hey, Tidy."
00:04:04.166,00:04:05.833,"Um, Tyke likes to play, right?"
00:04:05.875,00:04:08.375,"- Oh, my, yes."
00:04:05.875,00:04:11.083,- How about we take Tyke into another part of the kelp forest to play for a while?
00:04:12.375,00:04:15.916,"We'll be seal-sitters for the day, eh?"
00:04:15.958,00:04:17.583,Do you really think you're up to it?
00:04:17.625,00:04:20.083,"I mean, Tyke is a real fin-full."
00:04:20.125,00:04:23.208,Seal pups are very curious and full of energy.
00:04:25.208,00:04:28.833,What could go wrong?
00:04:28.875,00:04:32.375,It all went wrong!
00:04:32.416,00:04:34.916,"Oh, she's making a huge mess!"
00:04:34.958,00:04:38.583,I'm making a huge mess!
00:04:38.625,00:04:41.125,I know!
00:04:42.875,00:04:46.708,"Oh, look! Hey, hey, Tyke!"
00:04:46.750,00:04:50.125,A perfect shell for Shell Catcher.
00:04:50.166,00:04:51.875,"You wanna play a game, Tyke?"
00:04:51.916,00:04:53.916,Play a game!
00:04:53.958,00:04:59.541,"Okay, you're gonna take this shell over to that rock before we tag you."
00:04:59.583,00:05:01.125,- Yeah!
00:05:01.166,00:05:02.500,Got it.
00:05:02.541,00:05:05.000,shell catcher!
00:05:05.041,00:05:07.125,Tyke is the one!
00:05:05.041,00:05:09.291,Shell-- Did I win!
00:05:12.375,00:05:14.375,Fun! What's next?
00:05:16.291,00:05:20.500,But we didn't even finish Shell Catcher.
00:05:20.541,00:05:22.125,"Hey, Tyke, guess what?"
00:05:22.166,00:05:23.500,We have another game we can play.
00:05:23.541,00:05:25.208,Huh? Yeah.
00:05:23.541,00:05:26.833,You wanna play-- Ah!
00:05:26.875,00:05:29.541,How about freeze tag?
00:05:29.583,00:05:31.083,Ooh!
00:05:31.125,00:05:33.750,- Me too! Not it!
00:05:33.791,00:05:35.250,"Wait, that's not how you play the game."
00:05:35.291,00:05:36.916,That's not how you play!
00:05:36.958,00:05:38.625,- Fun!
00:05:38.666,00:05:39.791,What's next?
00:05:41.000,00:05:43.625,"Let's try freeze tag again, okay?"
00:05:43.666,00:05:49.125,"Now, Tyke, you stay frozen when I tag you until Splash unfreezes you."
00:05:49.166,00:05:50.125,- Yeah.
00:05:50.166,00:05:51.458,- Got it!
00:05:51.500,00:05:53.958,Okay!
00:05:56.166,00:05:58.125,Hmm.
00:05:58.166,00:05:59.625,Huh.
00:06:00.750,00:06:03.041,"Way to go, Tyke, you did it!"
00:06:03.083,00:06:04.083,Tag! You're frozen!
00:06:04.125,00:06:06.750,"Wha-- oh, no!"
00:06:06.791,00:06:07.958,"She got me, Tyke!"
00:06:10.041,00:06:12.166,"Come unfreeze me, Tyke!"
00:06:12.208,00:06:15.500,"- Where are you, Tyke?"
00:06:16.875,00:06:20.916,"Oh, boy, she's going through our games faster than we can think of new ones."
00:06:20.958,00:06:23.166,How are we going to keep her busy all day?
00:06:23.208,00:06:26.041,"Well, maybe Tidy will know what we can do with her."
00:06:26.083,00:06:28.000,"Yeah, hey, great idea."
00:06:28.041,00:06:30.791,"You swim back to ask Tidy, and I'll keep Tyke busy."
00:06:30.833,00:06:32.416,- Okay!
00:06:34.500,00:06:40.458,"Ah, I tell ya, a place for everything, and everything in its place!"
00:06:40.500,00:06:44.541,"Aw, Tidy, old boy, you've got it all figured out!"
00:06:49.625,00:06:51.625,How's your day with Tyke?
00:06:51.666,00:06:58.083,"Well, we tried playing different games, but every time we start playing, she swims off to check out something else."
00:06:58.125,00:06:59.791,What are we doing wrong?
00:06:59.833,00:07:02.291,"Well, nothing."
00:07:02.333,00:07:04.541,Seal pups are just very curious.
00:07:04.583,00:07:08.083,"If you want to keep her attention, just keep introducing her to something new."
00:07:08.125,00:07:11.625,"Ahh! Great idea, Tidy!"
00:07:14.166,00:07:16.958,"Now, would you mind moving off this section of the algae bed?"
00:07:17.000,00:07:18.916,"I, uh-- I just finished cleaning it up."
00:07:18.958,00:07:21.250,"Oh, oh, yeah, sure!"
00:07:25.833,00:07:27.583,"Splash, uh, w-where's Tyke?"
00:07:27.625,00:07:29.708,- Is she okay?
00:07:29.750,00:07:35.208,"She just went up to breathe, and I'm just-- Oh, Tidy was right."
00:07:35.250,00:07:41.833,"Well, Tidy says that seal pups are curious and they get excited about new things."
00:07:41.875,00:07:45.125,So we need to keep showing her new things.
00:07:45.166,00:07:50.083,"Oh, hey, I got an idea."
00:07:50.125,00:07:53.791,How about we do a treasure hunt to find the perfect pebble for finball!
00:07:53.833,00:07:56.125,Now you're talking!
00:07:56.166,00:07:58.333,Let's start switching up the games!
00:07:58.375,00:08:00.000,- Bubbles!
00:08:00.041,00:08:01.500,"Ah, there you are, Tyke."
00:08:01.541,00:08:04.458,You want to help us out?
00:08:04.500,00:08:06.666,We need to find the perfect pebble.
00:08:06.708,00:08:10.833,Perfect pebble?
00:08:10.875,00:08:12.250,Perfect pebble!
00:08:12.291,00:08:16.125,"No, this is too small."
00:08:16.166,00:08:19.958,- Perfect pebble!
00:08:20.000,00:08:23.041,- Perfect pebble!
00:08:23.083,00:08:25.375,"- Oh, hey, uh, Tyke!"
00:08:25.416,00:08:28.708,"Oh. well, I guess-- I guess she lost interest again."
00:08:28.750,00:08:32.000,"Yeah, maybe we should take her back to Tidy's."
00:08:32.041,00:08:35.750,"- I mean, we don't have any-- Splash! Bubbles!"
00:08:37.291,00:08:40.291,Yeah!
00:08:40.333,00:08:43.166,- Yeah!
00:08:44.750,00:08:47.083,Aww.
00:08:47.125,00:08:49.375,"Well, maybe we should head back to his place."
00:08:49.416,00:08:52.625,- Yeah.
00:08:52.666,00:08:55.291,She likes that idea.
00:08:55.333,00:09:01.958,"Finally, my algae bed is nice and neat and-- - Tidy!"
00:09:02.000,00:09:03.791,"Oh, Tyke, Tyke, Tyke, wait one moment, please!"
00:09:03.833,00:09:06.083,- Aww.
00:09:06.125,00:09:07.583,Looks like she missed you.

00:09:19.666,00:09:24.541,"In my kelp forest, we like to keep it nice and clean!"
00:09:24.583,00:09:25.833,Hit it!!
00:10:10.166,00:10:33.416,"as you found it Keep it clean, I'm begging you."

00:10:37.250,00:10:41.041,"But, Tidy, you've worked so hard to clean up your red algae bed while we were gone."
00:10:43.833,00:10:47.791,"Well, I do love to clean, so at least Tyke gives me plenty to do."
00:10:49.291,00:10:51.875,"Uh, so, uh, Tyke, uh, whatcha got there?"
00:10:51.916,00:10:54.666,Perfect Pebble...

00:11:32.000,00:11:35.000,"Come on, Tyke! See ya, kids!"
00:11:35.041,00:11:36.833,- Thanks for your help!
00:11:36.875,00:11:39.208,"- Bye, Tidy."
00:11:39.250,00:11:40.958,Keep it clean!
00:11:41.000,00:11:43.458,"Huh, I wonder where Tidy is taking Tyke now."
00:11:47.666,00:11:50.041,- Yeah.
00:11:51.875,00:11:55.416,Not my nice clean algae bed!
00:11:58.291,00:12:00.125,"Oh, good luck, Chipper!"
00:12:05.375,00:12:09.458,It's going to be a fin-tastic day!
00:12:09.500,00:12:11.750,"Hey, Maury!"
00:12:11.791,00:12:13.791,Isn't it a glorious morning!
00:12:15.875,00:12:17.916,Couldn't have said it better myself!
00:12:19.375,00:12:20.583,"Morning, Wave!"
00:12:22.833,00:12:24.375,You know it!
00:12:24.416,00:12:27.041,Splash and Bubbles!
00:12:27.083,00:12:30.041,"Good morning, Mayor Sting!"
00:12:32.833,00:12:34.250,"Yeah, I didn't even know you were there."
00:12:34.291,00:12:35.791,How did you see us?
00:12:35.833,00:12:38.375,"Oh, it's just a little sense we stingrays have."
00:12:38.416,00:12:41.583,I can always tell where other creatures are.
00:12:41.625,00:12:43.458,It really helps when patrolling the reef!
00:12:43.500,00:12:44.625,I bet!
00:12:44.666,00:12:46.416,You two have fun!
00:12:46.458,00:12:49.208,"- We will! Thanks, Mayor Sting!"
00:12:49.250,00:12:56.625,"Well, if Mayor Sting says that we need to have fun, we definitely have to find something fun to do."
00:12:56.666,00:12:59.208,I'm pretty sure that's a rule.
00:12:59.250,00:13:01.583,Yeah.
00:13:01.625,00:13:03.291,"Oh, that's a great idea!"
00:13:03.333,00:13:04.750,"- Yeah, let's-- - Hey, guys!"
00:13:06.375,00:13:09.583,"Oops, sorry about that."
00:13:09.625,00:13:12.041,We're gonna play hide-and-seek.
00:13:12.083,00:13:15.458,"Oh, thanks, but I don't think I can play hide-and-seek."
00:13:15.500,00:13:18.000,Remember?
00:13:18.041,00:13:22.083,That means I can sense where you are even if I can't see you.
00:13:22.125,00:13:23.875,I don't know about that.
00:13:23.916,00:13:26.333,I'm pretty good at hide-and-seek.
00:13:27.708,00:13:30.541,Close your eyes.
00:13:30.583,00:13:32.000,Okay!
00:13:32.041,00:13:34.125,This is gonna be so good!
00:13:34.166,00:13:35.166,All right.
00:13:38.083,00:13:39.250,- Where is Bub-- - Behind the rock.
00:13:41.000,00:13:42.791,Whoa.
00:13:42.833,00:13:45.833,"And now she's behind that rock, and, Splash, you're right next to me."
00:13:45.875,00:13:47.833,- What?!
00:13:49.041,00:13:51.291,And now she's right behind me.
00:13:51.333,00:13:52.833,- What?!
00:13:52.875,00:13:55.333,"Wow, Zee, that was incredible!"
00:13:55.375,00:13:57.958,You're so lucky that you have electroreception.
00:13:58.000,00:14:00.083,"Yeah, I wish I could do that!"
00:14:00.125,00:14:06.125,"But that means that I can't play any games where I have to find you, because I'd always know where you were."
00:14:06.166,00:14:08.291,"Yeah, I didn't really think about that."
00:14:08.333,00:14:13.208,"I love being a shark, but it's not easy feeling different from everyone else on the reef."
00:14:13.250,00:14:15.125,Yeah.
00:14:13.250,00:14:20.125,"When I first moved to Reeftown, there weren't any yellowback fusiliers around to play with, and well, I felt kinda different, too."
00:14:20.166,00:14:23.750,"True, but still, you were a fish like us."
00:14:23.791,00:14:27.541,I wish there was another shark living on the reef.
00:14:27.583,00:14:29.625,"- Oh, hi, Maury!"
00:14:35.583,00:14:38.375,- Should I spread the word?
00:14:38.416,00:14:41.541,Zee was just talking about how she's the only shark here.
00:14:41.583,00:14:44.208,"Yeah, and that there's no one like her in Reeftown."
00:14:44.250,00:14:47.333,"Oh, right, right, right, right."
00:14:47.375,00:14:51.750,"Of course, Zee is the only shark in Reeftown, that's true."
00:14:51.791,00:14:57.416,"Uh, although I did hear something about a distant relative around here that's like her."
00:14:57.458,00:14:58.833,"Wait, what?"
00:15:02.916,00:15:09.250,"I don't have all the details, but I'm sure that I heard that Zee has another relative on the reef."
00:15:09.291,00:15:11.458,"So, uh, bye!"
00:15:14.291,00:15:18.500,I have a distant relative on the reef!
00:15:21.666,00:15:24.291,It's like searching for a long-lost cousin!
00:15:28.125,00:15:31.708,"Yeah, but, uh, well, how do we find out who it is?"
00:15:38.500,00:15:41.166,"One, two, three, four, five!"
00:15:41.208,00:15:43.666,"Yep, that's how many there are."
00:15:43.708,00:15:45.708,And don't forget my teeth.
00:15:45.750,00:15:49.000,have teeth like a shark.
00:15:49.041,00:15:52.458,- There's a lot in there.
00:15:53.916,00:15:56.250,"Hey, I know someone who has great teeth!"
00:15:57.708,00:15:59.125,Chompy!
00:16:01.166,00:16:03.000,"Well, hey, y'all!"
00:16:03.041,00:16:05.791,Come to see me clean the algae from the coral?
00:16:05.833,00:16:10.791,"Nope, we came out so I can hang out with my cousin."
00:16:10.833,00:16:13.125,- Yeah!
00:16:13.166,00:16:18.666,"Yeah, you two have to be cousins, because you both have such wonderful teeth!"
00:16:18.708,00:16:22.041,"Oh, my! I didn't know I had a tooth cousin."
00:16:24.333,00:16:28.083,"And I am very proud of my teeth, and yours are amazing as well."
00:16:28.125,00:16:31.625,Ooh! This is gonna be so much fun!
00:16:31.666,00:16:33.166,- You know it!
00:16:31.666,00:16:34.916,"- Oh, well, let's chomp on some coral then!"
00:16:34.958,00:16:37.375,"Oh, um, okay..."
00:16:42.458,00:16:43.625,"Ooh, ooh, wait, ooh."
00:16:46.541,00:16:48.083,Ptewy!
00:16:48.125,00:16:51.666,What... just... happened...
00:16:51.708,00:16:53.291,to your wonderful tooth?
00:16:55.791,00:16:58.250,But they get replaced by new ones.
00:16:58.291,00:17:00.083,Don't you do that?
00:17:00.125,00:17:04.041,"Oh, my, no!"
00:17:04.083,00:17:06.416,I don't know what I'd do if I lost one of my teeth.
00:17:08.083,00:17:11.500,"Guys, I don't think my teeth are the answer."
00:17:11.541,00:17:16.083,"Yeah, well, how about we look for someone with special gills instead?"
00:17:17.625,00:17:20.208,And I know someone who has really special gills.
00:17:20.250,00:17:22.333,Let's go see Gush!
00:17:24.500,00:17:27.166,around here somewhere.
00:17:30.166,00:17:33.750,He's right between those rocks.
00:17:33.791,00:17:35.583,Uncle Gush!
00:17:35.625,00:17:36.916,Huh?
00:17:36.958,00:17:39.250,"Hi, kids."
00:17:42.500,00:17:46.375,Yep We learned that Zee has a distant relative on the reef.
00:17:46.416,00:17:48.833,"And it must be you, because of your gills!"
00:17:48.875,00:17:50.875,"Oh, and look!"
00:17:50.916,00:17:53.500,Gush walks on his fins just like Zee!
00:17:53.541,00:17:56.833,I knew it would be Gush!
00:17:56.875,00:17:59.833,I don't think that means that Zee and I are related.
00:17:59.875,00:18:03.125,Really?
00:18:03.166,00:18:07.250,"Well, even mandarin dragonets like you, Bubbles, can walk on their fins."
00:18:09.000,00:18:13.541,we're fin-walking cousins?
00:18:17.750,00:18:19.625,- Oh.
00:18:22.708,00:18:24.750,"Oh, well, my gills sure are special."
00:18:24.791,00:18:28.541,They give me a great turbo boost!
00:18:28.583,00:18:30.333,There he goes!
00:18:30.375,00:18:32.166,Wow!
00:18:34.125,00:18:36.333,Go turbos!
00:18:36.375,00:18:38.833,Go... turbos?
00:18:38.875,00:18:40.541,"Oh, boy."
00:18:40.583,00:18:43.791,I don't think I have turbo boost with my gills.
00:18:43.833,00:18:46.875,"Well, I have it because it helps me catch my food."
00:18:52.000,00:18:53.958,"Yeah, I mean, we didn't even see you."
00:18:54.000,00:18:55.875,Zee was the one who found you.
00:19:00.000,00:19:01.750,That's right!
00:19:01.791,00:19:06.166,You can tell where creatures are without seeing them.
00:19:15.125,00:19:17.041,- Hello?
00:19:18.541,00:19:20.541,"Oh, he's close."
00:19:20.583,00:19:22.958,I can sense him!
00:19:23.000,00:19:24.333,"Hey, kids!"
00:19:26.458,00:19:28.708,How goes the day?
00:19:28.750,00:19:30.916,We're trying to find Zee's distant relative!
00:19:30.958,00:19:37.083,"Yeah, Maury said I have a relative right here in Reeftown, but we haven't found him yet."
00:19:37.125,00:19:39.208,"Well, don't give up."
00:19:39.250,00:19:42.958,You do have a distant relative right here on the reef!
00:19:43.000,00:19:45.041,Who is it?
00:19:45.083,00:19:47.583,I can tell you you're very close to finding out.
00:19:49.125,00:19:52.791,"Mayor Sting, you have a lot of gill slits."
00:19:52.833,00:19:55.833,Yep!
00:19:55.875,00:19:58.208,Just like Zee.
00:19:58.250,00:19:59.875,Wait a minute.
00:19:59.916,00:20:03.791,"Mayor Sting, are you related to me?"
00:20:03.833,00:20:05.041,Of course!
00:20:05.083,00:20:07.458,Stingrays and sharks are related.
00:20:07.500,00:20:10.000,- Wow!
00:20:11.958,00:20:14.458,You don't have to look the same to be related.
00:20:14.500,00:20:21.000,"It's what's on the inside that matters, from the cartilage in our bodies to the five gill slits on each side."
00:20:21.041,00:20:22.791,And here's another thing.
00:20:22.833,00:20:28.000,Stingrays have electroreception that helps us know where creatures are without seeing them.
00:20:28.041,00:20:31.250,I thought I was the only one!
00:20:31.291,00:20:33.041,That is incredible!
00:20:33.083,00:20:36.791,Who knew stingrays had electroreception?
00:20:36.833,00:20:41.333,Or that sharks and stingrays were related!
00:22:16.583,00:22:21.458,It is so amazing that sharks and stingrays - have so much in common!
00:22:21.500,00:22:25.708,I'm just so happy now to know that there's someone like me on Reeftown!
00:22:25.750,00:22:28.958,I hope this means you won't feel different anymore.
00:22:30.583,00:22:33.666,You guys have always accepted me just the way I am.
00:22:33.708,00:22:36.291,It didn't matter if I was different.
00:22:36.333,00:22:37.583,"Well, of course!"
00:22:37.625,00:22:39.375,You're our friend no matter what.
00:22:39.416,00:22:42.583,So what do you want to do now?
00:22:42.625,00:22:47.833,"Actually, I think I want to spend the day with some family."
00:22:51.833,00:22:55.000,"Well, then come on!"
00:22:55.041,00:22:57.291,Let's patrol the reef together!
00:01:10.000,00:01:12.750,Whoa-ho-ho!
00:01:21.416,00:01:25.208,That cave was one of the spookiest I've ever been in.
00:01:27.708,00:01:36.791,"But-- but it If you think that that cave is spooky, it's nothing compared to-- oh, no, no, no, no, no."
00:01:36.833,00:01:38.625,I can't even talk about it.
00:01:38.666,00:01:42.375,It's just too dark and spooky...
00:01:42.416,00:01:45.000,- and yucky.
00:01:45.041,00:01:47.708,"Come on, Ripple."
00:01:58.958,00:02:01.041,"Yeah, I've heard about the hagfish."
00:02:01.083,00:02:03.083,She lives way down in the deep.
00:02:05.666,00:02:14.083,"Ha, growing up in Reeftown, everyone talked about the spooky hagfish laugh."
00:02:15.750,00:02:19.375,And how it could be heard for miles and miles.
00:02:19.416,00:02:24.125,Or the slime monster that attacks anyone who gets near the cave.
00:02:24.166,00:02:32.000,Or how about the fact that she eats the fish and other creatures that sink to the deep.
00:02:32.041,00:02:33.916,What does this hagfish look like anyway?
00:02:33.958,00:02:37.916,"Well, uh, I've never actually seen her, but..."
00:02:37.958,00:02:44.625,"Come to think of it, I don't know anyone who's ever actually seen the hagfish, do you?"
00:02:44.666,00:02:49.666,"Probably because if they did see her, they never came back."
00:02:49.708,00:02:53.291,But so many creatures from all over have told these stories.
00:02:53.333,00:03:00.041,"Surely by now someone's gone to the hagfish cave - to check them out, uh, right?"
00:03:00.083,00:03:03.166,"You would have to be very, very brave to go there."
00:03:03.208,00:03:05.791,Exactly!
00:03:05.833,00:03:07.416,- Whoo!
00:03:07.458,00:03:09.083,- It'll be fun!
00:03:24.041,00:03:26.833,I bet the hagfish's cave is around here somewhere.
00:03:26.875,00:03:29.125,"Yeah, and being in the deep doesn't help."
00:03:29.166,00:03:31.041,I can't see anything.
00:03:31.083,00:03:34.375,"Well, we'll know we're close when we hear her spooky laugh."
00:03:35.833,00:03:37.666,- Whoa!
00:03:37.708,00:03:40.333,"Uh, yeah, her spooky laugh like, uh, that."
00:03:40.375,00:03:42.708,"All right, let's check it out."
00:03:42.750,00:03:44.583,"Yeah, come on, let's do it."
00:03:53.041,00:03:55.500,"Oh, it's the hagfish!"
00:03:55.541,00:03:57.333,Wait a minute.
00:03:57.375,00:04:00.333,Hagfish don't have bioluminescent lights.
00:04:00.375,00:04:03.375,"- Lu, is that you?"
00:04:03.416,00:04:06.125,"Oh, hey there, kids."
00:04:06.166,00:04:08.791,What brings you down to the deep today?
00:04:10.208,00:04:15.083,"We heard this really loud, spooky laugh and we thought it was the hagfish."
00:04:15.125,00:04:18.041,Hagfish?
00:04:22.500,00:04:28.625,"I'm sorry I spooked you kids, but Bob here was just tickling my funny bone."
00:04:28.666,00:04:30.041,"That's right, kids."
00:04:30.083,00:04:31.875,It's a laugh a minute with old Bob here.
00:04:31.916,00:04:33.541,"Boy am I glad we found you, Lu."
00:04:35.750,00:04:40.291,- So what can you tell us about the hagfish?
00:04:40.333,00:04:43.875,"You know, we never actually met that old hagfish."
00:04:43.916,00:04:47.333,"She lives right around here, but she pretty much keeps to herself."
00:05:42.208,00:05:43.833,- Brr.
00:06:10.083,00:06:12.000,"Good job, Bob."
00:06:34.708,00:06:38.791,"Okay, this is where Lu said the hagfish's cave would be."
00:06:38.833,00:06:41.500,So who's gonna go up and say hello?
00:06:41.541,00:06:42.750,- Not it.
00:06:42.791,00:06:45.625,"Okay, I'll do it."
00:06:45.666,00:06:47.500,"Heh, how spooky could it be?"
00:06:50.458,00:06:52.375,"You okay, Splash?"
00:06:54.208,00:07:00.416,"I'm just shivering because, uh, you know, it's, uh, a little bit colder down here in the d-d-d-d-- - Deep."
00:07:00.458,00:07:01.750,I'll do it.
00:07:14.375,00:07:15.750,- Oh!
00:07:15.791,00:07:17.625,It's the slime monster!
00:07:20.541,00:07:22.250,"Ahh, I'm pretty great."
00:07:22.291,00:07:25.916,This isn't monster slime.
00:07:25.958,00:07:30.333,"Hmm, you're still here, even after getting slimed?"
00:07:30.375,00:07:33.416,Yeah.
00:07:33.458,00:07:35.375,"In fact, I really like it."
00:07:35.416,00:07:38.375,- You do?
00:07:40.666,00:07:42.208,Boo.
00:07:43.458,00:07:44.791,"Oh, no, sweetheart."
00:07:44.833,00:07:48.833,I meant that's my name.
00:07:48.875,00:07:50.625,"Nice to meet you, Bubbles."
00:07:50.666,00:07:52.666,"Nice to meet you too, Boo."
00:08:00.875,00:08:04.333,"Oh, you're a funny one, my little puffy friend."
00:08:04.375,00:08:09.625,But I'm afraid there aren't any slime monsters here or anywhere else for that matter.
00:08:09.666,00:08:11.750,- There aren't?
00:08:14.458,00:08:17.666,It's my way to keep away predators.
00:08:17.708,00:08:20.833,"Oh, we're sorry."
00:08:20.875,00:08:23.083,"Oh, no, not at all, little one."
00:08:28.416,00:08:29.708,This happens.
00:08:34.458,00:08:44.333,"Well, I was just sitting in my slime pit not expecting any visitors, and I couldn't see who was there, so, you know, a fish can't be too careful down here in the deep."
00:08:44.375,00:08:46.208,"Um, I'm sorry."
00:08:46.250,00:08:49.625,Did I hear something about a slime pit?
00:08:49.666,00:08:51.333,"Oh, yes, indeed."
00:08:51.375,00:08:52.958,I love my slime pit.
00:08:53.000,00:09:04.250,"Not only is it filled with lots of the ooey, gooey things I love to eat, but my predators, they don't want to go anywhere near it, so it keeps me protected."
00:09:04.291,00:09:05.666,"Oh, would you care to see it?"
00:09:08.041,00:09:10.916,- Here I go!
00:09:13.041,00:09:14.916,Oh-ho-ho! Yeah!
00:09:14.958,00:09:18.083,"Oh, Boo, I feel so silly ever being scared of you."
00:09:20.416,00:09:22.833,Which one of you is talking?
00:09:22.875,00:09:25.291,"If we do, are you gonna slime us?"
00:09:29.458,00:09:33.708,"I just can't see who's talking to me, unless they're very close."
00:09:33.750,00:09:41.750,"My eyesight isn't very good, but then again, it's so dark down here, I couldn't see anything, even with good eyes."
00:09:46.583,00:09:51.041,So why were you all so scared of little old me anyhow?
00:09:51.083,00:09:53.500,- Uh...
00:09:56.916,00:10:00.791,"Ooh, I love stories."
00:10:00.833,00:10:03.791,"Uh, you know, there's one about your spooky laugh."
00:10:03.833,00:10:07.208,"Oh, I just love to laugh, that's all."
00:10:07.250,00:10:09.833,Nothing spooky about being happy.
00:10:09.875,00:10:12.875,"I mean, where do they come up with this stuff?"
00:10:16.291,00:10:20.375,"Yeah, there's also the stories about the slime monsters, of course."
00:10:20.416,00:10:23.041,"Well, guilty as charged there."
00:10:30.541,00:10:38.291,"Okay, okay, what about the last, really spooky story about..."
00:10:38.333,00:10:40.750,What?
00:10:48.125,00:10:51.750,"Oh, well, that is completely... true."
00:10:53.416,00:10:57.291,"Uh, why would you do that, Boo?"
00:10:57.333,00:11:05.000,"Well, what I really do is eat all of the bacteria and germy stuff that falls to the bottom of the ocean called detritus."
00:11:08.708,00:11:19.041,"That's right, if that detritus sits around too long, it would spread germs in the water, which could make a lot of creatures down here sick, so I take care of that by just eating it up."
00:11:19.083,00:11:24.791,"Wow, so all the legends we heard were partly true, but not for the reasons we thought."
00:11:30.625,00:11:33.416,Really?
00:11:33.458,00:11:37.750,"Well, we were missing out on spending time with a wonderful new friend like you."
00:11:39.375,00:11:41.333,"- Ahh-ahh, who's there?"
00:11:41.375,00:11:42.583,Whoa! Whoa.
00:11:50.958,00:11:54.375,"Now, who wants to check out the slime pit?"
00:11:54.416,00:11:57.333,- I do! Let's go!
00:11:57.375,00:11:58.958,"Come on, let's go!"
00:12:03.375,00:12:05.583,"Good evening, Reeftown residents."
00:12:05.625,00:12:08.500,It's been a fin-tastic day.
00:12:10.791,00:12:15.083,"Maury, Denny, it's gonna be a beautiful night in Reeftown."
00:12:19.375,00:12:20.666,Yeah.
00:12:20.708,00:12:22.000,"Hello there, Wave."
00:12:22.041,00:12:24.333,We'll have calm and clear waters tonight.
00:12:24.375,00:12:25.791,Sounds good.
00:12:25.833,00:12:28.041,"Ahh, yeah!"
00:12:29.458,00:12:30.750,"Hey, Mayor Sting."
00:12:30.791,00:12:33.125,What are you doing?
00:13:33.916,00:13:36.666,"That's one nice-looking sand sculpture, Dunk."
00:13:36.708,00:13:37.791,"Thanks, Mayor Sting."
00:13:37.833,00:13:39.708,Are you gonna make another one?
00:13:39.750,00:13:43.875,"Uh, not today, it's getting pretty late, and it'll be dark soon."
00:13:43.916,00:13:48.083,I think I kind of lost track of time working on my masterpiece.
00:13:48.125,00:13:50.333,"Well, it's gonna be a big, bright bubble night tonight."
00:13:50.375,00:13:53.125,So you won't have to worry about it getting too dark.
00:13:56.416,00:13:59.625,Everything looks spooky.
00:13:59.666,00:14:01.333,"Are you afraid of the dark, Dunk?"
00:14:01.375,00:14:02.625,Not all of it.
00:14:02.666,00:14:04.500,Just the parts where there's no light.
00:14:04.541,00:14:06.375,"Well, there's no need to worry."
00:14:06.416,00:14:09.458,"I'll be on patrol, so Reeftown will be quiet and peaceful."
00:14:09.500,00:14:11.958,"Thanks, Mayor Sting."
00:14:12.000,00:14:13.583,Yeah.
00:14:13.625,00:14:17.125,"This is a pretty good one, if I do say so myself."
00:14:17.166,00:14:19.458,Which I do.
00:14:26.208,00:14:29.541,- Ohh.
00:14:29.583,00:14:34.125,"Oh, hey-o, big, bright bubble."
00:14:34.166,00:14:39.000,I'm really happy you're shining big and bright tonight.
00:14:40.166,00:14:43.458,Not that I'm afraid of the dark.
00:14:48.208,00:14:50.125,Yeow!
00:14:50.166,00:14:52.333,Now I'm afraid of the dark!
00:14:52.375,00:14:54.291,Dunk? What happened?
00:14:54.333,00:14:55.750,Are you okay?
00:14:55.791,00:14:59.125,Th-th-there's something in my house.
00:14:59.166,00:15:00.750,"Well, what is it?"
00:15:00.791,00:15:05.708,"I don't know, but it was prickly and pointy with a million stinging spikes on it!"
00:15:05.750,00:15:09.333,I think it was a monster.
00:15:09.375,00:15:12.500,"Dunk, you know monsters aren't real."
00:15:12.541,00:15:15.541,Of course they aren't...
00:15:15.583,00:15:18.250,"Well, I'm sure it's just your imagination."
00:15:18.291,00:15:20.958,But I'll go check.
00:15:22.166,00:15:25.000,Hmm... hmm.
00:15:27.291,00:15:31.208,I don't see anything in here!
00:15:35.250,00:15:37.375,So was it just my imagination?
00:15:37.416,00:15:39.041,No! Swim away!
00:15:39.083,00:15:40.916,- Swim away!
00:15:45.166,00:15:47.625,"There's probably nothing in there, right?"
00:15:47.666,00:15:49.500,"I mean, this is silly."
00:15:49.541,00:15:52.625,"Right, so silly, of course."
00:15:52.666,00:15:54.958,"So, uh, what are we doing out here?"
00:15:55.000,00:15:59.833,"Well, we're just, uh, hanging out, keeping each other company."
00:15:59.875,00:16:02.291,keeping each other company.
00:16:02.333,00:16:03.625,Not scared.
00:16:03.666,00:16:06.208,"Yep, not scared at all."
00:16:08.750,00:16:11.166,"Oh, oh, oh, we didn't mean to scare you."
00:16:11.208,00:16:13.541,Quiet.
00:16:17.125,00:16:19.583,We're hiding from...
00:16:19.625,00:16:22.166,the monster in my home.
00:16:22.208,00:16:25.166,"Oooh, a monster?"
00:16:25.208,00:16:28.541,"Yeah, is it goopy and gooey and gross?"
00:16:28.583,00:16:30.291,- Yeah.
00:16:32.166,00:16:39.250,It's spiky and sharp and probably has snarling teeth just waiting to take a bite...
00:16:39.291,00:16:40.875,It's true!
00:16:40.916,00:16:43.791,I felt it with my own fins. Oh!
00:16:43.833,00:16:49.416,"And that's why I'm staying out here all night, where it's safe."
00:16:49.458,00:16:51.708,You're gonna stay out here all night?
00:16:51.750,00:16:53.833,But where will you sleep?
00:16:53.875,00:16:58.541,"Uh, oh, uh..."
00:16:58.583,00:17:00.458,I can settle in here.
00:17:00.500,00:17:03.958,It's perfectly comfortable.
00:17:07.000,00:17:09.166,"Yeah, you know what?"
00:17:09.208,00:17:11.833,"You're more than welcome to stay with one of us, Dunk."
00:17:11.875,00:17:13.250,Really?
00:17:13.291,00:17:16.708,Thanks.
00:17:16.750,00:17:20.666,But what if the monster decides to stay more than one night?
00:17:23.625,00:17:26.875,So what will you do about the monster?
00:17:26.916,00:17:31.000,"Well, I guess I'll just have to ask it to leave."
00:17:31.041,00:17:33.208,"I just said that out loud, didn't I?"
00:17:34.791,00:17:36.083,Ugh.
00:17:36.125,00:17:39.291,Okay...
00:17:43.958,00:17:48.541,"All right, monster, you better, uh, get out of my home..."
00:17:48.583,00:17:50.625,"well, if you don't mind."
00:17:50.666,00:17:52.541,You know what?
00:18:02.750,00:18:06.166,"There's a monster in there, and-- oh!"
00:18:06.208,00:18:07.708,Ow.
00:18:07.750,00:18:10.666,Those are some really pokey spines.
00:18:13.833,00:18:17.541,"Well, you're not a monster at all."
00:18:17.583,00:18:19.333,My name's Archie.
00:18:19.375,00:18:20.625,"Hey, look."
00:18:20.666,00:18:22.625,It was just a cute little sea urchin.
00:18:22.666,00:18:24.916,"Aww, hi, Archie."
00:18:24.958,00:18:29.125,"Well, I guess we just bumped into your spines and thought you were a monster."
00:18:29.166,00:18:30.166,Sorry.
00:18:31.791,00:18:34.250,"Oh, don't worry."
00:18:31.791,00:18:35.791,"That's why you have spines, to protect you."
00:18:38.916,00:18:40.833,"Watch out, predators."
00:18:43.833,00:18:46.541,"Oh, I just love your little tube feet."
00:18:46.583,00:18:49.291,They're so cute.
00:18:52.000,00:18:54.291,Look at that.
00:18:54.333,00:18:58.000,He's a little reef climber.
00:18:58.041,00:19:03.875,"I think his tube feet are like cute little suction cups, like an octopus' tentacles."
00:19:03.916,00:19:06.916,Look at me!
00:19:06.958,00:19:09.291,I can't believe we were scared of him.
00:19:09.333,00:19:12.125,- Yeah.
00:19:19.000,00:19:20.500,I live higher.
00:19:23.083,00:19:24.625,Hiding lower.
00:19:24.666,00:19:26.250,Hiding from what?
00:19:26.291,00:19:28.291,The thing up there.
00:19:28.333,00:19:29.833,Huh? What?
00:19:29.875,00:19:31.166,"Oh, that?"
00:19:31.208,00:19:33.666,"Oh, that's just the big, bright bubble."
00:19:42.125,00:19:43.500,Ow.
00:19:43.541,00:19:45.791,Ow.
00:19:45.833,00:19:49.333,"Wow, you weren't kidding about those spines, Archie, whew."
00:19:49.375,00:19:50.583,Come on.
00:19:53.125,00:19:55.916,Hold on.
00:19:55.958,00:19:57.583,"up there, Dunk."
00:19:57.625,00:19:59.416,"Oh, why did we pick the same place to hide?"
00:19:59.458,00:20:01.875,- Ow! Ow!
00:20:01.916,00:20:04.833,"Dunk, why aren't you hiding with us?"
00:20:04.875,00:20:10.333,"Well, if Archie wasn't a monster, what if that thing's not a monster either?"
00:20:16.083,00:20:18.041,There's no one here.
00:20:18.083,00:20:21.458,"Well, I guess we scared him off."
00:20:24.708,00:20:28.041,- I don't think we did!
00:20:29.541,00:20:31.458,And it's coming right for us!
00:20:31.500,00:20:32.666,What do we do?
00:20:32.708,00:20:35.166,"- Uh, everyone hide!"
00:20:40.291,00:20:43.333,Wait. That's not a monster.
00:20:43.375,00:20:45.000,Then what is it?
00:20:45.041,00:20:46.250,That's...
00:20:49.625,00:20:51.541,Whoa!
00:20:51.583,00:20:54.666,I wasn't too sure who was swimming around in the dark.
00:20:57.500,00:20:58.750,Same here.
00:20:58.791,00:21:00.583,I'm glad it was just you kids up here.
00:21:02.750,00:21:07.750,"Well, there's a little sea urchin hiding from you - in Dunk's home."
00:21:07.791,00:21:09.750,"Well, he was afraid of your big shadow."
00:21:09.791,00:21:13.583,"Hmm, well, I guess I can look pretty spooky at night."
00:21:13.625,00:21:16.750,"Well, you sure spooked all of us."
00:21:16.791,00:21:22.291,"You know, I don't think Archie would be so scared if he knew it was you."
00:21:24.875,00:21:26.625,"That's what I do, little fella."
00:21:26.666,00:21:31.250,I circle the reef at night to make sure everything is safe and sound.
00:21:31.291,00:21:34.666,I wonder why he didn't get scared till tonight.
00:21:34.708,00:21:38.125,I suppose there's always a chance he's never seen me at night.
00:21:38.166,00:21:41.958,"Well, how is that possible?"
00:21:42.000,00:21:44.125,"Well, sea urchins don't have eyes."
00:21:44.166,00:21:48.250,"Instead, all around their bodies, their tube feet have light receptor cells on them."
00:21:48.291,00:21:50.875,And they use those to detect light and shadows.
00:21:50.916,00:21:55.541,You mean their cute little tube feet aren't just used for walking around?
00:21:55.583,00:21:58.125,Nope.
00:21:58.166,00:21:59.916,"Hi, everyone."
00:22:01.250,00:22:08.416,"Since the big bubble was so bright tonight, there was enough light for Archie to see me swim by, and my big shadow must have scared him."
00:22:08.458,00:22:11.208,"From now on, I'll say, Hello there, Archie!"
00:22:11.250,00:22:12.750,Then you'll know it's me.
00:22:12.791,00:22:15.416,"Well, I should continue patrolling the reef."
00:22:15.458,00:22:16.541,"Have a good night, kids."
00:22:16.583,00:22:18.166,Mayor Sting!
00:22:18.208,00:22:21.666,- Bye!
00:22:23.250,00:22:26.375,I could certainly use some shut-eye after all that.
00:22:32.416,00:22:34.208,Still a little scared?
00:22:34.250,00:22:36.083,How about if I stay with you tonight?
00:22:36.125,00:22:38.916,"Well, I thought you didn't like the dark."
00:22:38.958,00:22:40.541,"Well, I don't."
00:22:40.583,00:22:43.250,But it's not so spooky when you're with a friend.
00:22:43.291,00:22:45.166,Okay. Good night.
00:22:45.208,00:22:47.625,"Good night, Dunk."
00:22:47.666,00:22:49.875,Yay. Snuggle time.
00:22:56.833,00:22:59.375,- Good night.
00:01:24.041,00:01:26.208,"- What a hit, Dunk!"
00:01:31.625,00:01:35.666,"Well, that's what happens when you have big muscles!"
00:01:39.125,00:01:44.291,"If you had hit that fin ball any further, it would've gone to the end of the ocean."
00:01:49.791,00:01:50.958,There's no end of the ocean.
00:01:51.000,00:01:52.791,"It's all one big ocean, remember?"
00:01:52.833,00:01:56.541,"Well, that's true, but the ocean must end somewhere."
00:01:58.541,00:02:00.291,"Yeah, what about when you get to land?"
00:02:00.333,00:02:02.208,Isn't that the end of the ocean?
00:02:02.250,00:02:05.666,- Uh...
00:02:05.708,00:02:10.625,"Well, the ocean doesn't end at the land, it just kind of goes around it."
00:02:10.666,00:02:12.083,"Well, I guess that's true."
00:02:12.125,00:02:13.708,"- Actually, kids..."
00:02:13.750,00:02:18.291,Ha-ha! Would you believe that you're all right?
00:02:22.416,00:02:27.166,"Well, Splash, you and Bubbles are right because we're all part of one big ocean."
00:02:27.208,00:02:29.916,- Ha-ha!
00:02:29.958,00:02:35.083,But Dunk and Ripple are also right because the ocean water does end somewhere.
00:02:35.125,00:02:39.625,"Okay, so if we were all right, I have a big question."
00:02:41.791,00:02:44.166,What is at the end of the ocean?
00:02:44.208,00:02:46.125,"- Oh, yeah!"
00:02:46.166,00:02:48.083,We're having a hard time figuring it out.
00:02:48.125,00:02:55.541,"I suppose I could tell you, but the Reeftown Rangers I know don't want to be told any answers."
00:02:55.583,00:02:58.750,They like to discover the answers for themselves.
00:02:58.791,00:03:00.916,Oh-ho!
00:03:00.958,00:03:03.833,I want to see the end of the ocean for myself.
00:03:03.875,00:03:05.500,"Yeah! Me too, me too."
00:03:05.541,00:03:08.375,a little tricky to find.
00:03:08.416,00:03:09.833,"Aw, that's no problem, Flo."
00:03:09.875,00:03:13.916,I'm sure we can find it in no time at all if we hop on a current!
00:03:13.958,00:03:16.416,- Yeah!
00:03:21.833,00:03:23.583,"Oh, boy."
00:03:26.750,00:03:31.208,- Hold onto your fins!
00:03:31.250,00:03:33.666,Yeah! All right!
00:03:33.708,00:03:35.208,"Here we are at, uh..."
00:03:38.166,00:03:40.791,"Yeah, this can't be the end of the ocean."
00:03:44.625,00:03:46.791,"True, but..."
00:03:49.166,00:03:50.958,I'm not sure what.
00:03:51.000,00:03:53.583,"Can't quite put my fin on it, but..."
00:03:53.625,00:03:56.375,something.
00:03:56.416,00:03:58.958,Nah. Water's water!
00:03:59.000,00:04:07.875,"Well, we should keep looking around here because Flo said there was an end of the ocean, and she's really smart, so it's gotta be around here somewhere."
00:04:07.916,00:04:10.000,- Hmm.
00:04:10.041,00:04:13.875,"Well, I guess we went the wrong way or something because, well, this can't be it."
00:04:13.916,00:04:16.125,- Can't be what?
00:04:20.208,00:04:22.166,- Yeah.
00:04:22.208,00:04:24.750,- But who?
00:04:24.791,00:04:27.166,- That was who?
00:04:27.208,00:04:30.000,"Oh, sorry. That was me."
00:04:32.291,00:04:34.166,But I gotta keep in shape.
00:04:34.208,00:04:35.666,Big. Big. Big!
00:04:35.708,00:04:41.166,"Uh, well..."
00:04:41.208,00:04:42.666,- Oh! Where are my manners?
00:04:42.708,00:04:44.125,- Good-bye!
00:04:44.166,00:04:47.166,"Wait, where are you swimming to, Sal?"
00:04:47.208,00:04:50.083,"Oh, uh, um, well, come with me and I'll tell you!"
00:04:52.125,00:04:54.791,"Oh, I got a big swim coming up."
00:04:54.833,00:04:57.750,- Going upstream!
00:04:57.791,00:04:59.791,"Do you mean, like, against the current?"
00:04:59.833,00:05:05.291,"Well, sort of, but instead of swimming in the ocean, I'll be swimming in freshwater, which is why I came here, where the ocean ends."
00:05:05.333,00:05:07.875,So the ocean does end.
00:05:07.916,00:05:10.958,"Oh, you bet, in fact, the ocean water ends very soon!"
00:05:11.000,00:05:13.291,It does?
00:05:13.333,00:05:15.291,- A wall?
00:05:15.333,00:05:24.916,"Or maybe a giant rock that's all like, No more water Oh, I wish I had time to answer all these questions, but all this talk is keeping me from my big swim!"
00:05:24.958,00:05:28.000,"- It's big, big, big!"
00:05:28.041,00:05:30.375,But where is the end of the ocean?!
00:05:30.416,00:05:35.208,"Oh! He said it was close, but all I see is water."
00:05:40.250,00:05:43.125,"Uh, come on, guys, We can catch up to him. Come on."
00:05:45.500,00:05:48.416,"Uh... uh, Sal?"
00:05:48.458,00:05:49.791,"Hey, Sal, we had a question for you."
00:05:49.833,00:05:52.291,We were-- agh!
00:05:52.333,00:05:54.541,- Coming through!
00:06:02.791,00:06:04.458,- I said the ocean ends.
00:06:04.500,00:06:07.208,I never said anything about the water ending!
00:06:07.250,00:06:12.125,"Okay, not only is Sal very fast, he's also very confusing."
00:06:12.166,00:06:17.583,"But, Sal, if the water ends, the ocean must end too because, well, the ocean's made of water!"
00:06:17.625,00:06:20.416,The ocean is made of water.
00:06:20.458,00:06:24.666,"But the ocean is made of saltwater, which isn't the only kind of water on Earth."
00:06:24.708,00:06:27.916,"It isn't? But-- but Sal, wait."
00:06:27.958,00:06:29.666,- Yeah!
00:06:29.708,00:06:31.750,"Oh, kids, I don't have a lot of time."
00:06:31.791,00:06:37.375,"I got a big, big swim upstream in the river, which is made of another kind of water, freshwater."
00:06:37.416,00:06:40.750,- So there's two kinds of water?
00:06:40.791,00:06:48.666,"There's saltwater, like the ocean, freshwater, which has no salt in it, and then there's a mix of the fresh and saltwater called brackish water."
00:06:48.708,00:06:51.541,So the two types of water can mix together!
00:06:51.583,00:06:55.458,"Sure, in places just like this, where the water from the river meets the water from the ocean."
00:06:55.500,00:06:58.750,"Oh, wow!"
00:07:01.166,00:07:04.125,And there's places made of water besides the ocean?
00:07:04.166,00:07:07.708,A-a-a-and he's gone.
00:07:07.750,00:07:13.125,"what's harder to find, the end of the ocean or Sal!"
00:07:13.166,00:07:15.208,- Whoa!
00:07:15.250,00:07:17.791,"Oh, there sure are places made of water beside the ocean."
00:07:17.833,00:07:26.416,"There are lakes, which are bodies of water surrounded by land, and there are rivers, which are big streams of freshwater that all flows in one direction."
00:07:26.458,00:07:28.250,- Wow.
00:07:28.291,00:07:31.000,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:07:31.041,00:07:36.041,"We've been all around the ocean, so how come we've never been to any lakes or rivers before?"
00:07:36.083,00:07:38.541,You wouldn't like it there.
00:07:45.958,00:07:49.958,"Oh, you've spent too much time in this brackish water."
00:07:50.000,00:07:54.916,"Once we get you back to the saltwater, you'll feel better, come on, let's go."
00:07:54.958,00:07:56.583,All right.
00:08:00.250,00:08:02.333,That's better.
00:08:05.541,00:08:07.875,"Yeah! You said it, Dunk."
00:08:07.916,00:08:12.791,"It was nice to see a different place, but it's all saltwater for me from now on."
00:08:12.833,00:08:16.750,- That's probably a good idea.
00:08:16.791,00:08:24.625,"I mean, you seem perfectly fine in the brackish water, and you still seem fine here in the saltwater, so are you a freshwater or saltwater fish?"
00:08:24.666,00:08:28.458,"Oh, we sockeye salmon can swim in both fresh and saltwater with no problems."
00:08:28.500,00:08:32.833,Whoa!
00:08:32.875,00:08:37.375,of the very few fish that can swim in all kinds of water.
00:08:37.416,00:08:45.041,"I was born in freshwater, then I lived in the ocean, and now I'm going back to the freshwater - on my big, big, big swim!"
00:08:45.083,00:08:47.625,Wow!
00:08:47.666,00:08:53.666,"Before today, I never knew there was any such thing as lakes or rivers or freshwater."
00:08:53.708,00:08:59.958,"Yeah, and we definitely never knew that were incredible fish who can live in all types of water like Sal."
00:09:00.000,00:09:01.458,Hey-hey!
00:10:36.541,00:10:39.666,"All right, kids, I have to head back if I'm gonna make my big swim."
00:10:41.625,00:10:45.458,"Yeah. Big, big, big!"
00:10:45.500,00:10:46.666,That's the one!
00:10:46.708,00:10:51.541,"If I'm gonna make my swim, I really gotta keep up my exercises, but it was great meeting you kids."
00:10:51.583,00:10:53.791,"Next stop, freshwater!"
00:10:53.833,00:10:55.791,"All right, well, good luck on your swim, Sal."
00:10:55.833,00:10:59.125,Thank you! It's a big one!
00:11:03.291,00:11:08.833,"But Dunk, that brackish water back there is the start of where the freshwater and the saltwater mix."
00:11:08.875,00:11:13.500,Oh! Which means it's the end of the saltwater!
00:11:13.541,00:11:18.250,Yeah! Where we were just playing with Sal is the end of the ocean.
00:11:18.291,00:11:20.166,- You got it!
00:11:22.750,00:11:30.458,"Oh, kids, I am so proud of you for coming all this way and finding the end of the ocean."
00:11:37.250,00:11:39.458,But different water.
00:11:39.500,00:11:41.500,That's exactly right.
00:11:41.541,00:11:55.083,"And just like any great explorers, the Reeftown Rangers have gone where no ocean fish has ever gone before, the freshwater at the end of the ocean!"
00:11:55.125,00:11:56.166,- Yeah!
00:11:56.208,00:11:58.166,We did it!
00:12:02.541,00:12:06.625,"Now, that's what you call swimming right there."
00:12:06.666,00:12:07.708,"Nicely done, everyone."
00:12:07.750,00:12:10.208,"Hiya, Wave!"
00:12:15.125,00:12:18.083,Uh... yeah!
00:12:18.125,00:12:20.791,"Ooh, good."
00:12:20.833,00:12:23.833,"Well, that's just the thing."
00:12:23.875,00:12:26.833,We want you to pick where we're going today.
00:12:33.208,00:12:37.666,"The only question is, where should I send you?"
00:12:37.708,00:12:41.791,"Oh, well, any place you want!"
00:12:41.833,00:12:44.750,"Well, not the sky."
00:12:44.791,00:12:46.875,So anywhere in the ocean will be fine.
00:12:50.875,00:12:54.708,"Ooh, and someplace with lots of interesting creatures to meet."
00:12:56.541,00:13:01.000,"Someplace really cool, huh?"
00:13:01.041,00:13:04.333,"In fact, it's the coolest place around."
00:13:04.375,00:13:08.000,- All right!
00:13:12.666,00:13:14.458,"Oh, boy."
00:13:24.458,00:13:25.666,All right!
00:13:25.708,00:13:28.458,"Now, let's see where Wave sent us."
00:13:28.500,00:13:31.166,"- Wow, it's hard to say."
00:13:31.208,00:13:33.458,I don't see any interesting creatures.
00:13:33.500,00:13:35.208,Or anything to do.
00:13:35.250,00:13:41.750,"Hmm, true, but Wave was right about one thing: it's definitely cool."
00:13:41.791,00:13:45.041,"You know, it is pretty brisk."
00:13:45.083,00:13:47.500,"That's the spirit, Dunk!"
00:13:47.541,00:13:49.000,Wakes you right up!
00:13:50.875,00:13:54.583,I'm sure there's lots of fun stuff to do and see here.
00:13:54.625,00:13:56.416,"Well, we'll see."
00:13:56.458,00:13:59.666,"I guess if we keep going, we're bound to bump into something."
00:13:59.708,00:14:01.375,- Whoa!
00:14:03.875,00:14:05.708,Whoa is right.
00:14:05.750,00:14:08.333,It's an iceberg!
00:14:08.375,00:14:11.000,No wonder it's so cold.
00:14:11.041,00:14:13.958,We must be in the Arctic Ocean!
00:14:22.500,00:14:26.333,"Well, if we were going South this whole time, this must be..."
00:14:28.416,00:14:30.000,Yep.
00:14:30.041,00:14:35.666,It's the kind of place where a puffer fish can really stretch out and relax.
00:14:35.708,00:14:38.041,"If you can get past the icebergs, that is."
00:14:40.125,00:14:46.958,"I think the last time we were here, we were all so cold, we-- we didn't take the time to appreciate how beautiful Antarctica really is."
00:14:51.375,00:14:52.708,And the cold.
00:14:52.750,00:14:54.250,"Yeah, that too."
00:14:54.291,00:14:57.291,I think we need to start moving to keep warm.
00:14:57.333,00:15:00.541,"And besides, if we're moving, we might find a new friend."
00:15:00.583,00:15:02.208,Like a penguin!
00:15:04.750,00:15:07.458,Where? I love pebbles!
00:15:07.500,00:15:09.791,"Wait, so you're not Pebbles?"
00:15:09.833,00:15:13.583,Pebbles?
00:15:13.625,00:15:16.541,"- Hi, everybody!"
00:15:18.541,00:15:20.458,I didn't mean to send you flipping and flopping.
00:15:20.500,00:15:21.875,I'm just so excited.
00:15:21.916,00:15:24.083,I don't see many fish like you around here.
00:15:27.791,00:15:32.500,We're the Reeftown Rangers!
00:15:32.541,00:15:36.458,Whoa! Fearless explorers?
00:15:36.500,00:15:43.583,"Oh, it is, we travel all over the ocean, seeing lots of stuff and meeting interesting ocean creatures."
00:15:43.625,00:15:47.000,"- Just like you, Dive."
00:15:47.041,00:15:49.916,Interesting?
00:15:49.958,00:15:53.375,"So, what else do you Reeftown Rangers do?"
00:15:53.416,00:15:55.458,"Well, uh, so much stuff."
00:15:55.500,00:15:56.500,Where to begin?
00:15:56.541,00:15:58.583,- Ha-ha-ha!
00:16:49.750,00:16:51.416,Come on!
00:17:18.125,00:17:21.791,Let's go!
00:17:33.291,00:17:40.458,"Oh... boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, I can't wait to show you guys all the amazing things the Antarctic has to offer."
00:17:40.500,00:17:42.875,If you...
00:17:42.916,00:17:45.583,"If you want to see everything, we gotta go."
00:17:45.625,00:17:47.875,We're coming.
00:17:47.916,00:17:51.708,"If you're a little chilly, I know just what you guys need."
00:17:51.750,00:17:54.375,It's an old penguin trick for staying warm.
00:17:54.416,00:17:56.666,R-r-really?
00:17:56.708,00:17:58.708,It's called cuddling.
00:17:58.750,00:18:04.000,"We're warm-blooded, so when we penguins get cold, we huddle up together, and we keep each other warm."
00:18:04.041,00:18:06.416,- Try it!
00:18:06.458,00:18:08.541,I'll try anything to stay warm.
00:18:12.041,00:18:13.375,Warm thoughts.
00:18:16.166,00:18:19.458,"This just tickles, and I don't feel any warmer."
00:18:19.500,00:18:21.625,"Yeah, maybe we're doing it wrong."
00:18:21.666,00:18:23.083,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:23.125,00:18:26.916,"Well, fish aren't really warm-blooded, so this might not even work anyway."
00:18:26.958,00:18:30.833,"Whoo! Guys, this really tickles."
00:18:30.875,00:18:35.291,- Sorry.
00:18:35.333,00:18:39.833,"if you think that was funny, - I got a joke for you."
00:18:39.875,00:18:42.708,What sits and shivers at the bottom of the ocean?
00:18:42.750,00:18:43.958,"Uh, what?"
00:18:48.208,00:18:51.083,nice and toasty.
00:18:52.916,00:18:54.833,Here!
00:18:55.916,00:18:57.916,What? He's a good cuddler.
00:18:59.916,00:19:02.083,"Well, I've had a lot of practice."
00:19:02.125,00:19:07.041,"Where I live, above the surface, my family and I cuddle up to keep warm all the time."
00:19:07.083,00:19:10.041,Come on!
00:19:12.166,00:19:15.166,"Oh, that is so much better."
00:19:15.208,00:19:17.666,Great. So what's next?
00:19:20.875,00:19:23.833,Or more cuddling?
00:19:23.875,00:19:25.500,"I don't know, Dive."
00:19:25.541,00:19:27.916,I think we're starting to slow down here.
00:19:27.958,00:19:29.791,It's cold.
00:19:33.708,00:19:37.250,Oh. Already?
00:19:46.875,00:19:53.416,"well, Dive, you know, it's clear you really love the ocean, and that's just what we look for in a Reeftown Ranger."
00:19:53.458,00:19:56.208,And you have a great sense of adventure.
00:19:56.250,00:19:58.291,Yeah. That's right.
00:19:58.333,00:20:01.666,I think we should make you an honorary Reeftown Ranger.
00:20:04.625,00:20:06.958,"Yes, yes, yes!"
00:20:07.000,00:20:08.375,"I do, I do!"
00:20:11.291,00:20:15.541,"Now, let's do the Reeftown Ranger cheer!"
00:20:18.125,00:20:21.791,Forever! Yay!
00:20:21.833,00:20:24.541,"Okay, so... let's go."
00:20:24.583,00:20:26.541,"After all, I am a Reeftown Ranger."
00:20:26.583,00:20:30.041,I guess that means I have to live in Reeftown.
00:20:33.541,00:20:36.750,There's no land for you to live on in Reeftown.
00:20:36.791,00:20:39.541,Hmm.
00:20:39.583,00:20:42.708,We gentoo penguins are pretty good swimmers.
00:20:48.083,00:20:50.500,That's a lot faster than I can go on land.
00:20:50.541,00:20:53.541,"Wow. Well, Dive..."
00:20:53.583,00:20:56.583,"I guess if you want to come, it's okay with us."
00:20:58.375,00:21:02.291,I'm gonna be a Reeftown Ranger!
00:21:02.333,00:21:04.125,- Whoo!
00:21:04.166,00:21:06.666,"Well, I'm gonna be an iceberg if we don't get going."
00:21:06.708,00:21:10.333,Okay. Let's go to Reeftown!
00:21:15.125,00:21:16.583,- Uh...
00:21:16.625,00:21:20.291,"Well, Dive, we just left, so-- Oh, right."
00:21:22.375,00:21:24.125,Are we in Reeftown now?
00:21:25.625,00:21:28.833,"Dive, Reeftown is really far away."
00:21:28.875,00:21:31.125,We had to take three currents just to get here.
00:21:31.166,00:21:34.750,Three currents?!
00:21:38.291,00:21:42.500,We gentoo penguins can only go about 15 miles away from the land.
00:21:42.541,00:21:46.375,"Well, Dive, Reeftown's a lot further than 15 miles away."
00:21:46.416,00:21:52.958,"Huh. Well, when they do come to visit, we can all stay in a nice, cool spot, right?"
00:21:53.000,00:21:58.958,"Actually, Dive, the water's a lot warmer in Reeftown than it is here."
00:21:59.000,00:22:02.041,So... no cuddling?
00:22:05.333,00:22:07.708,I have a question.
00:22:07.750,00:22:12.375,Can you be a Reeftown Ranger and not live in Reeftown?
00:22:17.375,00:22:28.750,"That's right, Dive, so as long as you love to explore and meet new creatures and teach them all about your love of the ocean, well, then, you'll always be a Reeftown Ranger, - Yeah!"
00:22:28.791,00:22:31.083,Thank you!
00:22:31.125,00:22:39.916,"I cannot wait to go tell my friends and family all about my new best buddies, the Reeftown Rangers!"
00:22:42.625,00:22:47.958,"And I bet by the time we come back to Antarctica, you'll have some new recruits for us."
00:22:48.000,00:22:49.416,I will for sure!
00:22:49.458,00:22:52.250,I'm gonna go start looking for them now!
00:22:52.291,00:22:54.000,"- All right, bye!"
00:22:54.041,00:22:57.250,"You too, fellow Reeftown Rangers!"
00:01:04.083,00:01:08.375,"Okay, the game is called surprise fish."
00:01:10.416,00:01:12.625,Oh!
00:01:14.083,00:01:16.166,I thought that was the surprise part.
00:01:16.208,00:01:19.708,- How do you play?
00:01:16.208,00:01:24.083,"- Okay, well, we all hide and then try to surprise each other by jumping out when someone's not expecting it!"
00:01:26.250,00:01:27.916,"Yeah! Okay, ready? Okay."
00:01:27.958,00:01:31.041,"One, two, three..."
00:01:31.083,00:01:32.958,hide!
00:01:35.833,00:01:37.416,Yeah! Uh...
00:01:37.458,00:01:40.166,"No, that's not a good place to hide."
00:01:40.208,00:01:42.833,"Oh, maybe over here!"
00:01:42.875,00:01:44.041,Uh... no.
00:01:44.083,00:01:46.250,"Ooh, perfect!"
00:01:46.291,00:01:47.625,Yeah!
00:01:49.208,00:01:51.333,"I gotcha, Dunk!"
00:01:51.375,00:01:53.875,- That was hilarious!
00:01:53.916,00:01:59.416,"Yeah, it really was, you jumped so high, I thought you were gonna break the surface of the water!"
00:01:59.458,00:02:00.791,"Hey, you guys should have seen it, Bubbles!"
00:02:00.833,00:02:03.416,Bu-- Bubbles?
00:02:03.458,00:02:06.916,- Ripple?
00:02:08.375,00:02:11.833,I wonder where they could-- - Aah!
00:02:11.875,00:02:13.750,"Oh, yeah, I meant to do that!"
00:02:13.791,00:02:16.875,"Oh, that was so much fun!"
00:02:16.916,00:02:19.625,"- Okay, come on!"
00:02:20.750,00:02:22.666,"Oh, boy, look at this spot!"
00:02:22.708,00:02:26.416,I'm gonna surprise those fish so good! Ha!
00:02:27.916,00:02:30.208,- Where did he go?
00:02:30.250,00:02:31.583,He was just here.
00:02:31.625,00:02:34.458,Dunk?! Are you okay?!
00:02:34.500,00:02:37.000,- Surprise!
00:02:39.583,00:02:43.458,I thought we were playing surprise fish.
00:02:49.625,00:02:51.708,- Do you smell something?
00:02:51.750,00:02:55.250,- Yeah. Kind of a...
00:02:58.791,00:03:03.000,"Yeah, it smells good, but i-it kind of makes me feel scared."
00:03:03.041,00:03:06.458,"Yeah, you know what? Me too."
00:03:06.500,00:03:10.500,"Where did that smell come from, and why is it making us feel this way?"
00:03:10.541,00:03:12.666,- Hey!
00:03:12.708,00:03:14.666,Is everyone okay here?
00:03:14.708,00:03:18.708,"Oh, hi, Gush, we were just playing surprise fish."
00:03:18.750,00:03:23.208,It's a super fun game where we jump out and try and surprise each other.
00:03:23.250,00:03:25.291,"Oh, I'll have to take your word for that."
00:03:25.333,00:03:31.750,"I don't quite understand why scaring each other is fun, but, hey, I'm just glad you're all right."
00:03:31.791,00:03:33.375,Were you worried about us?
00:03:33.416,00:03:36.333,Not until I smelled the alarm smell.
00:03:36.375,00:03:38.375,"- Oh, yeah."
00:03:38.416,00:03:40.875,That weird... sweet smell?
00:03:40.916,00:03:44.458,Yes! I think that sugary smell is from all of you.
00:03:44.500,00:03:46.291,"Wait, so..."
00:03:46.333,00:03:51.291,"when Dunk surprised us a minute ago, we all released that sweet smell?"
00:03:51.333,00:03:53.916,Even me.
00:03:53.958,00:04:01.083,"That's right, when we fish get frightened or injured, we release a chemical alarm smell into the water that other fish can detect."
00:04:01.125,00:04:04.041,"Ah, like a-- like a warning system."
00:04:04.083,00:04:08.166,"Yes. When they smell it, they know to look for trouble."
00:04:08.208,00:04:10.291,But we sent that smell out by accident.
00:04:15.291,00:04:18.791,"If they did smell it, then they'll think there's a problem!"
00:04:18.833,00:04:21.958,We better go check and make sure that they know everything's fine!
00:04:22.000,00:04:24.208,- Yeah.
00:04:24.250,00:04:25.791,- Let's go!
00:04:28.083,00:04:31.125,Hmmm...
00:04:34.208,00:04:35.875,I wonder what's wrong.
00:04:35.916,00:04:38.458,"Hi, Mayor Sting."
00:04:40.333,00:04:42.708,I'm investigating an alarm smell.
00:04:42.750,00:04:46.291,We need to let everyone know to be Reef Ready for now.
00:04:46.333,00:04:51.250,"No problem! Hey, Maury!"
00:04:51.291,00:04:53.625,You called?
00:04:53.666,00:04:56.583,What took you so long?
00:04:56.625,00:04:58.833,- There's an alarm smell.
00:04:58.875,00:05:00.500,There could be danger on the reef!
00:05:00.541,00:05:04.291,Oh! Consider it done. Hah!
00:05:59.541,00:06:01.416,- Oh!
00:06:37.208,00:06:38.541,Have you heard?
00:06:38.583,00:06:41.041,It smells like trouble on the reef.
00:06:41.083,00:06:43.833,Oh! Uh-oh!
00:06:47.541,00:06:48.875,Huh.
00:06:48.916,00:06:51.708,Is that Chompy hiding behind that coral?
00:06:53.333,00:06:57.875,"I bet she's playing surprise fish, and she's hiding, waiting to jump out and scare us."
00:07:02.708,00:07:05.083,"W-what's going on, Chompy?"
00:07:05.125,00:07:09.208,I'm not playing surprise fish.
00:07:09.250,00:07:10.791,But why?
00:07:10.833,00:07:18.125,"Well, I heard from Denny the cleaner shrimp that there's some kind of danger out there, so you better go get Reef Ready!"
00:07:18.166,00:07:21.166,It's not safe to be wandering around.
00:07:21.208,00:07:23.583,- What's the danger?
00:07:23.625,00:07:26.000,I hid before Denny could tell me.
00:07:26.041,00:07:28.291,"Huh. Thanks, Chompy."
00:07:28.333,00:07:30.458,Maybe we should go talk to Denny.
00:07:30.500,00:07:33.458,- Shh!
00:07:33.500,00:07:34.541,"- Oh, sorry!"
00:07:34.583,00:07:37.166,"Bye, Chompy!"
00:07:37.208,00:07:39.166,"Come on, guys."
00:07:39.208,00:07:41.583,"- Hey, Denny!"
00:07:41.625,00:07:44.333,"- Hi, guys!"
00:07:44.375,00:07:46.833,"Yes, Maury, I'm sure they heard the news."
00:07:46.875,00:07:49.166,Did you hear?
00:07:46.875,00:07:50.958,It's the worst thing that's ever happened to Reeftown.
00:07:51.000,00:07:53.625,Oh! W-what is it?
00:07:56.625,00:07:58.291,Who told you it was terrible?
00:07:58.333,00:08:00.333,"- Well, Maury did."
00:08:00.375,00:08:04.291,"Denny, would you mind taking a break so we can talk to Maury for a second?"
00:08:04.333,00:08:06.500,- Got it.
00:08:06.541,00:08:12.833,"Well, I was just trying to help spread the word about news on the reef, you know, as a favor to everyone."
00:08:19.583,00:08:24.875,"Well, yeah, that's what we wanted to talk to you about-- No time to talk."
00:08:26.791,00:08:29.250,"You guys should hide, too, if you know what's good for you."
00:08:29.291,00:08:31.166,"Uh, Maury, it doesn't make any sense."
00:08:31.208,00:08:33.916,How can we hide if we don't know what we're hiding from?
00:08:33.958,00:08:36.166,We-- yea-- uh...
00:08:36.208,00:08:43.416,"Oh. Well, uh, that's a good point, but if you want more information, you should talk to Zee."
00:08:43.458,00:08:45.250,"Guys, let's go straighten this out with Zee."
00:08:45.291,00:08:47.375,Maybe we'll get to the bottom of this.
00:08:47.416,00:08:49.583,Good luck.
00:08:49.625,00:08:52.291,"- Bye, Maury!"
00:08:54.416,00:08:57.125,"- Hey, Zee!"
00:08:57.166,00:09:01.500,- Uh... oh...
00:09:01.541,00:09:02.875,Zee!
00:09:02.916,00:09:06.208,- What happened to her?
00:09:06.250,00:09:09.708,Zee? Uh-- - Guys!
00:09:18.125,00:09:20.875,"Uh, well, we have good news."
00:09:20.916,00:09:23.291,There's nothing to worry about!
00:09:23.333,00:09:25.875,Are you sure?
00:09:25.916,00:09:28.166,I heard there's some danger out there.
00:09:28.208,00:09:30.125,Where did you hear about this danger?
00:09:30.166,00:09:32.250,Mayor Sting told me.
00:09:35.541,00:09:41.250,"Well, the thing is, uh, we might have given him the wrong idea."
00:09:41.291,00:09:43.000,What exactly did he say to you?
00:09:43.041,00:09:48.958,"He didn't exactly tell me what the danger was, but he definitely warned me."
00:09:49.000,00:09:53.458,"Hmm, well, then, you know what, Zee, we're gonna go talk to Mayor Sting to find out what happened."
00:09:53.500,00:09:54.916,- Okay.
00:09:54.958,00:09:57.333,- Be careful. Bye!
00:09:57.375,00:10:03.291,"When I was patrolling the Sandy Bed, I smelled danger-- actually smelled it."
00:10:03.333,00:10:05.791,So I alerted everyone in Reeftown.
00:10:05.833,00:10:08.458,"- We're sorry, Mayor Sting."
00:10:08.500,00:10:11.250,- It's part of the job.
00:10:16.083,00:10:20.000,"Well, I'm glad you told me, and I'm glad there's no cause for alarm."
00:10:20.041,00:10:24.375,"However, once you put the warning out, it's hard to take it back."
00:10:24.416,00:10:32.166,- Hey! Is there a smell we can release to let everyone know that it was just an accident from before?
00:10:32.208,00:10:34.458,"- That's a good idea, Dunk!"
00:10:34.500,00:10:38.375,"But unfortunately, once you release the smell, there's no way to take it back."
00:10:39.833,00:10:42.041,"Hey, I know!"
00:10:42.083,00:10:48.500,"We can go around and explain to everyone what happened, you know, one Reeftown citizen at a time!"
00:10:48.541,00:10:54.166,"All right, let's split into two groups - to spread the word faster."
00:10:54.208,00:10:57.708,So that this time I can spread the word that everything is fine!
00:10:57.750,00:10:59.708,You Reeftown Rangers ready?
00:10:59.750,00:11:01.500,- Let's do it!
00:11:01.541,00:11:03.291,"- Come on, everyone!"
00:11:03.333,00:11:04.833,"Yeah, spread the word!"
00:11:09.375,00:11:10.750,"Hey, it's okay!"
00:11:10.791,00:11:15.291,We were just-- Playing a game called surprise fish.
00:11:15.333,00:11:21.291,And we scared each other so bad-- That they released an alarm pheromone into the water!
00:11:21.333,00:11:25.333,So rest easy.
00:11:25.375,00:11:28.750,- Ah! We did it!
00:11:28.791,00:11:30.708,Everyone can go back to their normal lives.
00:11:41.541,00:11:44.041,- Surprise!
00:11:44.083,00:11:45.583,- Oh!
00:11:47.333,00:11:50.708,Does anyone smell anything?
00:11:50.750,00:11:53.166,"Uh, no, I think we're good."
00:11:55.125,00:11:57.250,"You got us, Dunk!"
00:12:05.791,00:12:09.208,Are we sure Dorsal wanted to meet us all the way out here?
00:12:09.250,00:12:12.125,Yep! He wanted us to meet him here like last time.
00:12:12.166,00:12:17.416,But I thought last time we met him over... here.
00:12:17.458,00:12:22.625,"No, I definitely remember it right... here."
00:12:23.875,00:12:25.875,"I remember it was blue, but..."
00:12:30.666,00:12:33.083,Ha ha!
00:12:33.125,00:12:38.208,"He's a dolphin, so he can use his echolocation to see things with sound!"
00:12:38.250,00:12:41.291,"Well, then, let's play!"
00:12:41.333,00:12:42.625,- Yeah!
00:12:42.666,00:12:44.458,"Finball, anyone?"
00:12:44.500,00:12:46.166,"Oh, absolutely!"
00:12:50.875,00:12:52.708,"Hey, I know that call!"
00:12:54.416,00:12:57.000,"Hey, guys!"
00:12:57.041,00:13:04.583,"Oh, I am so excited I could just-- I dunno, flip through the air as high as I can and make a big splash..."
00:13:04.625,00:13:07.500,which is just what I'm gonna do!
00:13:09.708,00:13:11.458,- Whoa!
00:13:11.500,00:13:14.000,- That's amazing!
00:13:14.041,00:13:16.541,- Wow!
00:13:16.583,00:13:19.541,- Ha ha!
00:13:25.083,00:13:28.500,"I sure am, I just heard my friend Spin is coming for a visit!"
00:13:28.541,00:13:30.583,"Oh, I can't wait for you guys to meet him!"
00:13:30.625,00:13:34.000,- Who's Spin?
00:13:30.625,00:13:35.708,"- Only the funnest, funniest, flippiest dolphin I ever knew!"
00:13:35.750,00:13:37.625,He sounds like he's a good friend.
00:13:37.666,00:13:39.625,He's my best friend!
00:13:45.083,00:13:47.041,Used to?
00:13:51.458,00:13:55.791,"I went in one and, well, Spin, he went in the other."
00:13:55.833,00:13:57.416,I haven't seen him since.
00:13:57.458,00:14:02.416,"But he'll be here soon, and then it'll be-- whoo-hoo-- fun!"
00:14:06.875,00:14:09.750,"Yeah, will you recognize him because he's gray?"
00:14:09.791,00:14:12.625,Or because he has a blowhole on the top of his head?
00:14:12.666,00:14:17.041,"That kinda describes all dolphins, but how could I forget my best friend Spin?"
00:14:17.083,00:14:23.291,We'll always be able to recognize each other by...
00:14:23.333,00:14:26.583,Ooh! Special whistle?
00:14:34.333,00:14:40.750,"Well, kinda like that, but dolphins make sounds like this..."
00:14:42.500,00:14:46.541,"Every morning, Spin would do his own special whistle, like this..."
00:14:49.375,00:14:51.583,"Well, that's not exactly it."
00:14:51.625,00:14:53.625,Only Spin can do it just right.
00:14:53.666,00:15:00.875,"Then I would whistle back with my special whistle, like this."
00:15:00.916,00:15:04.000,And that's how we always knew the other guy was coming!
00:15:04.041,00:15:07.958,Ah! So Spin will whistle to let you know he's nearby.
00:15:08.000,00:15:12.625,"Yeah, and then when we see each other-- Oh, you know what Spin and I used to do for fun?"
00:15:12.666,00:15:14.875,- What?
00:15:18.666,00:15:20.500,"You mean, like this?"
00:15:20.541,00:15:23.250,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:15:33.708,00:15:36.291,"- Fun, huh?"
00:15:36.333,00:15:38.000,"Oh, yeah!"
00:15:40.541,00:15:43.291,You guys wanna spin some more?
00:15:43.333,00:15:45.125,I think we get the idea.
00:15:45.166,00:15:48.833,"Spin and I have our special whistle, our signal, and our finshake."
00:15:48.875,00:15:50.500,Why do you need all of that?
00:15:50.541,00:15:54.208,"Well, that stuff makes us best friends no matter how long we've been apart."
00:15:54.250,00:15:57.708,"Even if we don't see each other for a long time, we'll always remember each other."
00:15:57.750,00:16:02.000,- Aw. That's really neat.
00:16:06.833,00:16:08.708,- You know...
00:16:08.750,00:16:09.958,We'll show you later.
00:16:10.000,00:16:12.125,- Yeah.
00:16:12.166,00:16:17.541,"In the meantime, I'm gonna head back to my pod and see if Spin's on the way!"
00:16:17.583,00:16:18.875,"- Okay, Dorsal."
00:16:18.916,00:16:20.541,- See you later!
00:16:20.583,00:16:22.208,Bye-bye!
00:16:25.208,00:16:26.708,"Oh, nice, Ripple!"
00:16:39.291,00:16:42.250,So maybe we should make some.
00:16:42.291,00:16:45.208,"Oh, that could be fun!"
00:16:45.250,00:16:47.625,"So, any ideas?"
00:16:47.666,00:16:50.625,Check this out!
00:16:50.666,00:16:54.666,We should do our own special whistle-spin-finshake.
00:16:54.708,00:16:56.541,Can any of us whistle?
00:16:56.583,00:16:58.375,"Oh, I almost got it, I almost got it!"
00:17:06.375,00:17:09.291,"Guys, maybe whistling just isn't our thing."
00:17:09.333,00:17:10.833,I've got it!
00:17:18.125,00:17:20.416,You're the only one of us who does that.
00:17:20.458,00:17:22.916,- Right.
00:17:22.958,00:17:24.333,"Uh, something else then."
00:17:24.375,00:17:27.583,Hey! What if we just invent our own signal?
00:17:27.625,00:17:29.333,Good plan!
00:17:29.375,00:17:30.791,Yeah.
00:17:30.833,00:17:31.833,- Okay.
00:17:31.875,00:17:33.166,- Uh-huh.
00:17:33.208,00:17:35.958,Okay.
00:17:36.000,00:17:38.000,And now we go to the other side.
00:17:38.041,00:17:39.625,- Yeah.
00:17:43.625,00:17:47.000,"Now, everyone say hah, hah, hoochey koo!"
00:17:47.041,00:17:51.000,- Okay.
00:17:51.041,00:17:54.166,- Now finish with a bow.
00:17:54.208,00:17:56.791,- And thank you...
00:17:59.166,00:18:02.666,"All right, you guys, I think we've got got our special signal!"
00:18:02.708,00:18:05.583,"All right, here... we... go!"
00:18:11.916,00:18:12.833,- Uh...
00:18:12.875,00:18:15.416,- Maybe so.
00:18:15.458,00:18:16.750,At least we have finball.
00:18:16.791,00:18:19.291,- Yeah! Ha ha.
00:18:19.333,00:18:23.166,- That's it!
00:18:23.208,00:18:26.500,No! We've already got our own special signals and games.
00:18:29.416,00:18:31.500,We're the only fish who play finball.
00:18:31.541,00:18:34.000,And we're Ocean Friends Forever.
00:18:34.041,00:18:36.916,And we go on adventures together!
00:18:36.958,00:18:44.666,"It may not be the same as Dorsal and Spin, but I'd recognize you guys anywhere, no matter how much time passes."
00:18:44.708,00:18:47.083,"Yeah! Hey, let's go tell Dorsal!"
00:18:52.000,00:18:54.791,- Dorsal! Dorsal! Dorsal!
00:18:54.833,00:19:02.666,"Dorsal! We loved seeing your dolphin signals, and now we have our own Reeftown Friend signal, too."
00:19:02.708,00:19:04.500,"Oh, that's great!"
00:19:04.541,00:19:07.750,I realized that friendship isn't about a whistle or a signal.
00:19:10.791,00:19:13.416,- Exactly!
00:19:10.791,00:19:16.625,"- Spin's my best friend because when we're together, we feel happy."
00:19:16.666,00:19:20.791,"- Gee, who knew having a best friend is really just that simple?"
00:19:20.833,00:19:22.500,"Well, we now we do!"
00:19:25.875,00:19:27.625,It's Spin!
00:19:35.583,00:19:37.833,- Dorsal!
00:19:41.958,00:19:44.625,"Oh, Spin, you haven't changed a bit!"
00:19:44.666,00:19:46.750,I'd know you anywhere!
00:19:46.791,00:19:49.125,It is so great to see you!
00:19:49.166,00:19:51.500,Ooh!
00:19:51.541,00:19:53.458,- Come on!
00:20:08.208,00:20:10.750,- Hi!
00:20:10.791,00:20:16.791,"Spin, this is Splash, Bubbles, Dunk, and Ripple, the best friends a dolphin can have."
00:20:16.833,00:20:18.833,"Well, except for you, of course!"
00:20:21.166,00:20:23.791,Thanks for being best friends to my best friend.
00:20:23.833,00:20:27.125,"Aw, well, he's an easy dolphin to like."
00:20:27.166,00:20:33.000,"Hey, you know what I-- - You go first."
00:20:33.041,00:20:35.916,"Okay, well, I've sure missed you, Dorsal."
00:20:35.958,00:20:40.791,And the one thing I've missed most of all is-- Touching fins and swimming in a circle?
00:20:43.416,00:20:47.000,Ha! That's exactly what I was going to say!
00:20:47.041,00:20:49.375,"- Come on, let's swim!"
00:20:49.416,00:20:51.250,- Whoo-hoo!
00:20:51.291,00:20:52.708,"Hey, you guys care to join us?"
00:20:52.750,00:20:55.291,We wouldn't have it any other way.
00:21:06.458,00:21:10.000,Everything's spinning!
00:21:12.541,00:21:16.000,I am so glad you got to meet my best friend.
00:21:20.333,00:21:23.916,- Best friends forever!
00:01:05.916,00:01:07.541,"Thanks for traveling with me, guys."
00:01:07.583,00:01:11.250,It's been so much fun having friends along while I ride the currents.
00:01:11.291,00:01:15.333,"We know you like to be independent, Scoot, but we just want you to meet our friend Flo."
00:01:22.250,00:01:24.791,- Flo. Flo!
00:01:24.833,00:01:26.416,I can't wait to meet her.
00:01:26.458,00:01:31.208,"Yeah! Well, if we just keep riding the currents, it shouldn't be too much longer."
00:01:35.291,00:01:41.208,- Maybe we should find a place - to stop and rest for a while.
00:01:41.250,00:01:43.625,"Besides, I love this part of the ocean."
00:01:46.166,00:01:49.041,"Uh, hey, Scoot, are you sure you're not getting tired?"
00:01:49.083,00:01:51.500,Tired? No!
00:01:57.500,00:02:00.000,See?
00:02:00.041,00:02:04.041,How is that possible?
00:02:04.083,00:02:07.416,"Well, we came out here to find Flo, and that's what we have to do."
00:02:09.125,00:02:11.875,Exactly where did Flo say she was going to lay her eggs?
00:02:11.916,00:02:14.208,Just that it's the place where she was born.
00:02:14.250,00:02:17.666,And I remember she said it was near a colorful reef.
00:02:17.708,00:02:22.833,"Oh, yeah, so the baby turtles could go there when they hatch out of their eggs and run into the ocean."
00:02:22.875,00:02:27.625,"Ooh, and one more thing-- Flo said the place she was born reminded her of Reeftown."
00:02:27.666,00:02:30.958,That's it!
00:02:31.000,00:02:35.166,It's just like Reeftown!
00:02:31.000,00:02:36.750,All we have to do is-- - Whee!
00:02:36.791,00:02:39.833,- All we have to do is- - Whee!
00:02:45.208,00:02:51.041,"Yeah, but there's only one Reeftown, with only one group of Reeftown Rangers."
00:02:51.083,00:02:53.125,"All right, you guys, come on, we should get going."
00:02:53.166,00:02:56.375,"Uh, hey, guys, where's Scoot?"
00:02:56.416,00:02:59.666,"Huh? Oh, uh, Scoot?"
00:02:59.708,00:03:04.625,"Huh, isn't it funny the one time you're looking for him, he's nowhere to be found?"
00:03:04.666,00:03:06.500,- Just back from the surface.
00:03:07.916,00:03:09.625,- Did you miss me?
00:03:14.708,00:03:17.750,- She might still be there.
00:03:17.791,00:03:20.333,- Are we there yet?
00:03:20.375,00:03:23.750,But we'll find the reef eventually if we just keep following this current.
00:03:23.791,00:03:26.416,Gotcha.
00:03:26.458,00:03:27.625,"Uh, not yet."
00:03:27.666,00:03:29.458,- Are we there now?
00:03:29.500,00:03:32.791,"- Hey, are we there yet?"
00:03:32.833,00:03:37.375,No. We are looking for a reef in the middle of nowhere.
00:03:37.416,00:03:38.791,And it could take days.
00:03:38.833,00:03:41.083,"- It could take-- - Hey, it's a reef."
00:03:44.541,00:03:49.375,"Whoa. This can't be the colorful reef that Flo was talking about, right, Scoot?"
00:03:49.416,00:03:52.583,I don't think so.
00:03:52.625,00:03:54.250,I'll go check it from the surface.
00:03:54.291,00:03:56.958,I'll be right back.
00:03:57.000,00:03:58.208,Yeah.
00:03:58.250,00:04:01.833,"Well, it's shaped like a reef."
00:04:01.875,00:04:08.666,"And it almost looks like it could be a reef, but it doesn't have any color, it's-- it's completely white."
00:04:08.708,00:04:12.833,Hello?
00:04:12.875,00:04:16.791,Wow. It's quiet. Huh.
00:04:16.833,00:04:18.208,I wonder if anyone even lives here?
00:04:18.250,00:04:19.791,- Hey.
00:04:19.833,00:04:22.041,- Let's keep looking around.
00:04:22.083,00:04:26.875,"There doesn't seem to be anything alive on this reef, not even coral."
00:04:26.916,00:04:29.333,So I guess nobody's here.
00:04:41.083,00:04:42.291,"I'm Dunk. Say, Dusty."
00:04:42.333,00:04:46.000,"You're a parrotfish, aren't you?"
00:04:46.041,00:04:48.208,I am!
00:04:48.250,00:04:49.416,"We live on a reef, too."
00:04:53.958,00:04:56.083,"Yeah, I see it."
00:04:53.958,00:04:58.416,"You remind us of our friend Chompy, the parrotfish."
00:04:58.458,00:05:00.125,"Well, that makes sense."
00:05:00.166,00:05:06.541,"Parrotfish are very important to any reef, because we-- Parrotfish make sand and eat algae off the coral."
00:05:06.583,00:05:09.625,- I know all about sand.
00:05:13.375,00:05:16.083,"Well, why?"
00:05:16.125,00:05:17.500,"Oh, they left a long time ago."
00:05:17.541,00:05:18.958,There's nothing left here of this reef.
00:05:19.000,00:05:22.375,But why didn't you leave when everyone else left the reef?
00:05:22.416,00:05:23.875,"Oh, just doing my job, I guess."
00:05:23.916,00:05:27.083,It's my instinct to keep making sand.
00:05:28.875,00:05:32.458,Even if I don't know why I'm doing it sometimes.
00:05:32.500,00:05:34.666,"I think it's great that you make all this sand, Dusty."
00:05:34.708,00:05:36.416,- You do?
00:05:36.458,00:05:42.625,"Lucky for me, it's your instinct to make the sand, and it's my instinct to make patterns in the sand."
00:05:42.666,00:05:45.000,Patterns?
00:05:45.041,00:05:47.208,"Well, I'm a puffer fish."
00:06:18.083,00:06:20.250,Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
00:06:48.125,00:06:50.583,Yeah.
00:06:50.625,00:06:52.833,- All finished.
00:06:52.875,00:06:56.000,You made my sand look so beautiful. Thanks!
00:06:56.041,00:06:57.583,My pleasure.
00:06:57.625,00:07:00.916,"Now, if I could only make the rest of this reef look beautiful again."
00:07:00.958,00:07:03.666,It's hard to believe this is even a reef at all.
00:07:06.333,00:07:10.958,"It used to be colorful and full of life, but then, suddenly, it changed."
00:07:11.000,00:07:13.541,This place used to look like Reeftown?
00:07:13.583,00:07:15.875,What happened?
00:07:15.916,00:07:18.833,"Over time, the ocean water got warmer."
00:07:18.875,00:07:24.708,"One day it got to be too warm for the teeny, tiny organisms that live in the coral and feed it."
00:07:24.750,00:07:29.875,"Without these organisms to keep the coral healthy, you have, well, this."
00:07:29.916,00:07:34.916,"Wow. If that can happen to this reef, maybe it can happen to other reefs."
00:07:34.958,00:07:38.833,- Maybe even our reef.
00:07:40.916,00:07:42.583,"- Oh, no, no, no."
00:07:40.916,00:07:45.375,"- Wh-wh-wh-wh-- Dunk, breathe with me."
00:07:49.291,00:07:51.083,"- Good job, Dunk."
00:07:51.125,00:07:54.375,Is there anything we can do to help make your reef beautiful again?
00:07:54.416,00:07:59.541,"Oh, that's very kind of you to offer, but I just don't know if a few fish can restore a whole reef."
00:07:59.583,00:08:01.875,It's such a big job.
00:08:01.916,00:08:04.791,"Yeah, but every big job has to start with one small step."
00:08:04.833,00:08:08.750,"Well, I guess that's true, but what makes you so sure?"
00:08:08.791,00:08:10.541,"Well, that's our Ripple."
00:09:28.416,00:09:30.291,And I know just what to do.
00:09:30.333,00:09:31.916,"Sure, Dusty."
00:09:31.958,00:09:33.416,"Well, you see that green algae?"
00:09:33.458,00:09:38.000,"It took over when all those organisms left, and it is not good for coral."
00:09:38.041,00:09:42.541,"If you guys help me find all this algae to eat, it'll make the coral healthy."
00:09:42.583,00:09:44.833,"I think we can do that, Dusty!"
00:09:44.875,00:09:46.291,That would be great!
00:09:46.333,00:09:51.458,"Okay, everyone."
00:09:51.500,00:09:53.541,Ready? Go!
00:09:53.583,00:09:54.625,Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
00:09:54.666,00:09:56.791,I found some!
00:09:56.833,00:09:58.833,"- Thanks, Bubbles."
00:10:02.791,00:10:05.083,- Algae time.
00:10:07.916,00:10:09.625,Whoa.
00:10:09.666,00:10:12.250,Who won?
00:10:12.291,00:10:14.750,The real winner is the reef!
00:10:14.791,00:10:18.500,Everything you're doing is helping the coral get healthy again!
00:10:23.083,00:10:25.916,I must have eaten a whole reef worth of algae.
00:10:25.958,00:10:28.333,"Well, the coral does look a lot cleaner."
00:10:28.375,00:10:34.291,"Oh, thanks, but I guess it's not gonna come back to its old color anytime soon."
00:10:36.083,00:10:38.958,"It's not the whole reef, but it's a good start!"
00:10:39.000,00:10:41.958,Good? It's great!
00:10:42.000,00:10:46.875,"Oh, this spot used to be white and dying, and now it's colorful and alive again."
00:10:46.916,00:10:49.166,It gives me hope for the rest of the reef.
00:10:49.208,00:10:51.583,"Hey, I know!"
00:10:55.166,00:10:59.416,"Yeah, as in, we hope the rest of the reef can be healthy like this again."
00:10:59.458,00:11:01.916,Hope spot.
00:11:01.958,00:11:04.250,"Oh, thanks for all your help, everyone."
00:11:04.291,00:11:09.750,"And I hope that the next time you come back to this reef, I'll have a lot more hope spots to show you."
00:11:09.791,00:11:13.125,"And we're always glad to help, when we're in the neighborhood."
00:11:17.375,00:11:21.083,"Yeah, we're helping our little turtle friend cross the ocean."
00:11:21.125,00:11:24.291,"Wha-- uh, what turtle friend?"
00:11:27.291,00:11:28.458,Where is that little guy?
00:11:32.541,00:11:34.208,- Scoot?
00:11:34.250,00:11:36.458,Ready to go travel the current some more?
00:11:36.500,00:11:38.666,"Ooh, pretty coral."
00:11:38.708,00:11:41.083,"Aw, a baby hawksbill."
00:11:41.125,00:11:43.625,"Well, thanks again, everyone."
00:11:43.666,00:11:45.875,I'm gonna go check for more signs of life.
00:11:46.791,00:11:48.250,"Bye, Dusty!"
00:11:48.291,00:11:49.666,"Bye, Dusty."
00:11:49.708,00:11:52.291,"All right, Scoot-- Scoot?"
00:11:49.708,00:11:57.833,What-- uh-- There's a whole big ocean and plenty of time.
00:12:09.250,00:12:13.166,She's gonna love having a little turtle around.
00:12:13.208,00:12:14.958,I can't wait to meet Flo!
00:12:15.000,00:12:16.333,Air break!
00:12:16.375,00:12:20.750,"Oh, uh-- well, if we can keep track of Scoot for long enough to introduce him."
00:12:20.791,00:12:22.541,But how will we ever find Flo?
00:12:26.875,00:12:30.500,Wait.
00:12:26.875,00:12:34.041,What if Flo is laying her eggs at the same beach where Scoot was born?
00:12:34.083,00:12:38.500,But how would he remember how to get back there after swimming the currents for so long?
00:12:40.791,00:12:42.791,- Whoops!
00:12:45.041,00:12:47.708,So you guys want to go to the beach where I was born?
00:12:47.750,00:12:51.333,Yeah. We know that that's a crazy-- - Let's do it!
00:12:51.375,00:12:54.125,- I told you it was possible!
00:12:57.708,00:13:00.458,- Follow Scoot.
00:13:02.375,00:13:05.666,This is it. Right up there is where I was born.
00:13:05.708,00:13:09.041,Wow. What a cool place.
00:13:11.583,00:13:13.791,"Oh, I bet it'd be fun to live here!"
00:13:13.833,00:13:16.166,"Hey, let's go play!"
00:13:16.208,00:13:17.375,Okay!
00:13:17.416,00:13:18.791,Did you hear what Splash said?
00:13:18.833,00:13:20.000,Don't say it.
00:13:20.041,00:13:22.125,He said it would be fun to live here.
00:13:22.166,00:13:25.291,Instead of Reeftown?
00:13:26.958,00:13:29.916,have to see this place.
00:13:29.958,00:13:31.375,It is amazing!
00:13:31.416,00:13:35.500,"Scoot, how in the world did you remember how to get back here?"
00:13:40.250,00:13:41.458,"Hi, kids."
00:13:41.500,00:13:47.875,"Instinct is a feeling you get inside that tells you what to do, even when no one taught you how to do it."
00:13:50.375,00:13:51.500,"Um, this is Scoot."
00:13:51.541,00:13:54.041,"Well, hello, young turtle."
00:13:54.083,00:13:55.291,Hi.
00:14:02.625,00:14:08.666,And I just finished laying my eggs on the beach above the surface.
00:14:08.708,00:14:11.125,"See, I told you it was possible."
00:14:11.166,00:14:14.375,But how did you and Scoot know how to find this place?
00:14:14.416,00:14:15.833,"Oh, very simple."
00:14:15.875,00:14:18.666,Magnetic receptors in our brains.
00:14:18.708,00:14:21.500,- Magnetic receptors?
00:14:21.541,00:14:28.166,"They are a special sense of direction that keep turtles like me and, uh, Scoot..."
00:14:30.375,00:14:36.000,They pick up a magnetic field at the exact beach where we came from.
00:14:36.041,00:14:37.958,That's amazing!
00:14:40.625,00:14:42.416,"Oh, a few weeks."
00:14:42.458,00:14:52.833,Then those little newborn sea turtles will hatch on the beach and run their little flippers off before joining the citizens of the sea.
00:14:52.875,00:14:58.458,"And they'll use their magnetic receptors and instincts to go where they need to go, too?"
00:15:02.291,00:15:04.375,- Just like me.
00:15:08.000,00:15:10.416,I got more energy than you.
00:15:10.458,00:15:12.750,What? No way.
00:15:17.041,00:15:19.625,We're a little worried about Splash.
00:15:19.666,00:15:26.750,He keeps saying how much he likes all the different places we've been visiting and how he could live in all those places.
00:15:26.791,00:15:30.750,"And, well, what if he doesn't want to live in Reeftown anymore?"
00:15:34.833,00:15:39.750,Every creature in the ocean has a different idea of what home is.
00:15:39.791,00:15:43.041,Some stay in one place all their lives.
00:15:44.583,00:15:49.208,"Ye, and others travel the whole ocean."
00:15:49.250,00:15:52.250,"Like, uh, Scoot."
00:15:56.750,00:16:00.708,"That's right, Splash!"
00:17:22.333,00:17:24.750,I love this place.
00:17:24.791,00:17:32.291,Wow. Isn't it amazing to think that one ocean can have so many different kinds of life in it?
00:17:32.333,00:17:40.791,I know! In what other place could you find life as small as a tiny zooplankton - and as big as a-- - Whale.
00:17:40.833,00:17:43.916,"Yeah, that's right, Scoot."
00:17:48.583,00:17:52.000,"- Hi, everyone."
00:17:52.041,00:17:53.458,You guys know a whale?
00:17:53.500,00:17:55.500,"Hey, Melody!"
00:17:55.541,00:18:00.416,"- This is our new friend, Scoot."
00:18:02.625,00:18:05.958,- Migrating.
00:18:06.000,00:18:08.291,Traveling from one place to another.
00:18:08.333,00:18:13.416,I'm headed to a colder climate where I can find lots of food.
00:18:13.458,00:18:15.916,What a shame to have to do it all on your own.
00:18:18.166,00:18:21.916,"Aren't you all by yourself, Melody-- ohh!"
00:18:25.583,00:18:28.208,I guess you're not all alone.
00:18:28.250,00:18:33.166,"Nope, I've been migrating with my pod throughout the ocean."
00:18:33.208,00:18:38.000,"Yeah, just like little Scoot here and I - have been migrating as well."
00:18:38.041,00:18:43.458,"As a pod, we travel together and look out for each other, like a family."
00:18:46.000,00:18:50.958,"Bubbles and Dunk and Ripple and Flo-- well, they're my Reeftown family."
00:18:51.000,00:18:55.916,"Huh. Well, I don't know about you guys, but, well, I-- I really miss home."
00:18:55.958,00:18:57.750,"Hey, you want to head back to Reeftown?"
00:18:57.791,00:19:00.208,- Really?
00:19:00.250,00:19:03.958,This has been the best Reeftown Rangers adventure ever!
00:19:04.000,00:19:11.500,"And I loved exploring all over the ocean with you guys, but I miss home and-- That's the nicest thing you could say, Splash."
00:19:11.541,00:19:14.375,"But, Scoot, where will you go?"
00:19:14.416,00:19:20.625,"Like I told you, my home is the open ocean riding the currents and seeing the amazing places they take me to."
00:19:20.666,00:19:22.083,I love it!
00:19:30.958,00:19:34.791,That would be the best!
00:19:34.833,00:19:36.791,"Oh, we'll miss you, too."
00:19:36.833,00:19:44.250,"Well, look at it this way-- it's never really a good-bye when you live in one big ocean."
00:19:46.583,00:19:49.416,"Well, I guess we won't say good-bye, Scoot."
00:19:49.458,00:19:51.291,"Yeah, we'll just say..."
00:19:53.458,00:19:54.791,"Yeah, see you soon."
00:19:54.833,00:19:56.916,"And thanks for all the fun, guys."
00:19:56.958,00:19:59.333,"All right, come on now, Scoot."
00:19:59.375,00:20:02.208,How about you and I play a little finball?
00:20:04.875,00:20:06.375,We should head back to Reeftown now.
00:20:08.208,00:20:12.166,My pod and I are heading in the same direction as Reeftown.
00:20:12.208,00:20:16.166,"I could give you a ride on my tail to get home, if you'd like."
