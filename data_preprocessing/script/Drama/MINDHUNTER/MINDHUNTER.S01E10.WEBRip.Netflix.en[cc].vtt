[Holden] He's in there.

102

Gene, hello.
I'm Special Agent Holden Ford.

103
00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hi.
-Special Agent Bill Tench.

104
00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:02.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey.
-Detective Chambers, you guys have met.

105
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks for doing this.
You've been Mirandized, right?

106
00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Again.
-[Holden] Great.

107
00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're gonna do this
as quickly as possible.

108
00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:10.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure you've got
better things to do tonight.

109
00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:15.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Devier] <i>Army life wasn't for me.</i>
<i>I'll admit that.</i>

110
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too regimented. Couldn't stand them
barking orders at me all the time.

111
00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:22.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Holden exhales]
-I like things more laid back, you know.

112
00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:25.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Working outdoors, the fresh air.

113
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
John, my boss,
he was great about hiring me,

114
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even with the discharge.

115
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:33.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It seemed like a perfect fit.
Out in the weather, working with my hands.

116
00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Military's not for everyone.

117
00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:37.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't know that before you go in.

118
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You went voluntarily?

119
00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Nam was pretty much over,
figured it'd be low-key.

120
00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like you've married
and divorced twice.

121
00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:45.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What can I say?
I'm popular with the ladies.

122
00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:48.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Or unpopular.
-Depending on how you look at it.

123
00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Devier] I made mistakes.

124
00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Married my first girl when we were 16.

125
00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:53.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just after you dropped out of high school?

126
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Devier] Yeah.
-Why'd you drop out?

127
00:08:55.743 --> 00:08:56.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Trouble sitting still.

128
00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
School made me a little nuts, too.

129
00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.873 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, so you married your first girl.

130
00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:04.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why'd you split up?
-We were fighting all the time.

131
00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:06.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What about your second wife?
-[chuckles] Same story.

132
00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you're living again
with your first ex-wife?

133
00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:11.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I know. I know. It's kind of--

134
00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Same story? Still fighting?

135
00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Devier] Sometimes.
-But she's not 16 anymore.

136
00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Devier laughs] Nope. Oh, no.

137
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bloom of youth has faded.

138
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:25.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You all got a lot of information on me.

139
00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The FBI is thorough.

140
00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:30.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, well, what am I,
some kind of gangster?

141
00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:32.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bureaucracy.

142
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

143
00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:37.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, listen, I got to mosey
out of here soon, so if we could...

144
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course. Of course.

145
00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's get down to business.

146
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're really important to us, Gene.

147
00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:45.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were on Lisa's street
the week before she disappeared.

148
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You had a bird's-eye view
of the entire place.

149
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, but I mean, I didn't see nothing.

150
00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:53.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I was focused on them trees.
You got to be.

151
00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:56.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Especially when you're working the saw.
-Understood, but...

152
00:09:57.471 --> 00:09:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we're kind of grasping at straws here.

153
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're the closest thing we have
to an eyewitness.

154
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:07.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I took your polygraph.
I'm an open book.

155
00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:08.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Thank you.

156
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:11.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So...

157
00:10:12.486 --> 00:10:14.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you must have seen Lisa
coming and going that week.

158
00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:15.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not really.

159
00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Maybe once or twice.
-Well...

160
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If she wore that outfit,
couldn't have missed her.

161
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:27.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I guess I saw her
in that a couple of times.

162
00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:29.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feathered hat, silver baton?

163
00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh... yeah.

164
00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:33.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What time she catch the school bus
in the morning?

165
00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, let's see, I'd get there about 7:00,

166
00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:38.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
she'd come out maybe half hour later.

167
00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:41.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And what time did the bus
drop her back off?

168
00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I can't say.

169
00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, I mean, maybe 3:30, 4:00.

170
00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:49.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ever see her talk to anyone
when she got off the bus?

171
00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, sir.

172
00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:53.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyone on her street who looked like
he didn't belong there?

173
00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not that I can recall, but, I mean...

174
00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:59.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wasn't even working
the week that she disappeared.

175
00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

176
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, hold on, it almost ended.

177
00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:10.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what she had on her that day.

178
00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:17.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Heartbreaking.

179
00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-By all accounts, she was a sweet kid.
-Yeah, she seemed real friendly.

180
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You noticed that?

181
00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:28.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, just saw her playing in the yard
with her dog, you know.

182
00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:30.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, I guess you could say she was--

183
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Precocious?
-[Devier] Right.

184
00:11:32.983 --> 00:11:34.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you ever talk to her?

185
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-She ever talk to you?

186
00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Waved a time or two.
-[Holden] Hmm.

187
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:46.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[exhales] Was she a cheerleader?
-Majorette.

188
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Those girls on the dance team
are something else.

189
00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:53.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I always had the hots for them.

190
00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:55.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean...

191
00:11:58.634 --> 00:12:01.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she looks pretty tasty in that outfit,
doesn't she?

192
00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:06.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sure.
-It's very revealing.

193
00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:08.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I guess.

194
00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:11.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on.

195
00:12:12.356 --> 00:12:13.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys don't think so?

196
00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:17.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] I mean...

197
00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:20.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Holden] Definitely looks older than 12.
-See, that's what I thought.

198
00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Thank you. So it's not just me?

199
00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, these girls these days,
they're developing so early.

200
00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:27.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Sure are.

201
00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:30.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course, Lisa was in junior high.

202
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whoever picked her up
might not have known that.

203
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:38.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I'm sitting here
wracking my brain,

204
00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:40.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
trying to remember if I saw someone, but--

205
00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:42.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] We believe he thought
she was older.

206
00:12:42.219 --> 00:12:43.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was friendly, probably came up to him.

207
00:12:43.804 --> 00:12:46.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He thought if they got together,
it'd be consensual.

208
00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, 14 is the age of consent.

209
00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:51.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Is that right?

210
00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:53.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

211
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

212
00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess Georgia's kind of forward-thinking
in that respect.

213
00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:04.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, by the time
a woman has hair on her pussy,

214
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you'd think she'd be able to decide
who gets a piece of it.

215
00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:08.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Devier laughs]

216
00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:12.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, yeah, man.
I never thought about it like that before,

217
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but, yeah.
-[Holden] But it's true.

218
00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:15.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Could make a case.
-[Holden] Some women shave down there.

219
00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:17.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You ever see that?
-No.

220
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales] They look so young.

221
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you seen it?
-[Holden] No, but heard tell.

222
00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:26.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I tried to get my girlfriend to do it.
-You think she would?

223
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She's considering.
-[Devier] What did you even say to her?

224
00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told her, "Honey, this turns me on."

225
00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just direct like that?
-Yeah, I don't know if she's gonna do it.

226
00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:39.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Women have their own minds these days,
but it sure would be hot,

227
00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:41.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
don't you think?

228
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

229
00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:46.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You got to make it with that young pussy
before it turns into Mom.

230
00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:47.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

231
00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:53.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's chatting him up,

232
00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:55.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
maybe he's thinking
she looks old enough to wear this outfit,

233
00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:59.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
twirl a baton, march in the band, probably
got some hair on her, but not too much.

234
00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:00.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's take a break.

235
00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:03.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You need a break, Gene?
-[Devier] Um...

236
00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:07.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, I'm okay.
-Well, I need a break.

237
00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:11.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am gravely concerned
with this line of questioning.

238
00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:13.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you, you need to relax.

239
00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it came out in court we suggested
the girl flirted with him--

240
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How would it come out?
-He turned off the tape.

241
00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:19.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I saw that.

242
00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:21.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know about that, either.

243
00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You agree with this?

244
00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:25.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In theory. Not so much in practice.

245
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will take full responsibility
for what happens in there.

246
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Devier] <i>Most people</i>
<i>would call it a cherry picker,</i>

247
00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:43.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the industry term would be
a boom lift or a boom truck.

248
00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:46.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Holden] What's the highest you've been?
-About 50 feet.

249
00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:48.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-In a tree?
-That's right.

250
00:14:48.762 --> 00:14:51.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But you're in a harness, right?
-Well, of course, at that height.

251
00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:56.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But sometimes you got to get out
to get them faraway limbs.

252
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't look down, huh?
-No, that don't bother me no more.

253
00:14:58.939 --> 00:15:01.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You saw Lisa waving to you
a couple of times.

254
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Must not have been too far up to see that.

255
00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I'm not too sure.

256
00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She ever talk to you?
-No.

257
00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:08.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I already told you that.

258
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Okay.

259
00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why?
-[Holden sighs]

260
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:16.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have one person,
said she saw the two of you talking.

261
00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:20.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, I thought I was your star witness.
-[Holden] Only one watching the street.

262
00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:22.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen, you're a good-looking guy.

263
00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:25.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did she just come up to you,
being friendly?

264
00:15:25.549 --> 00:15:28.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She sees you up there every day,
sweating away in the hot sun.

265
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could she have maybe offered you a soda?

266
00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:36.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She could've come up and talked to me.

267
00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you remember?

268
00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:41.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I guess.
-It's coming back to you.

269
00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:44.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just that... she could've talked to me.

270
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did she say?

271
00:15:46.403 --> 00:15:47.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't know.
-[Holden] You don't?

272
00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Devier] No.
-No idea at all?

273
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:52.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You weren't listening?

274
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:55.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't recall.

275
00:15:55.704 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She ask you about your work,
your day, where you live?

276
00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:00.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something like that.

277
00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:01.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Small talk.

278
00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:03.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

279
00:16:03.837 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bet she thought
you were a handsome cuss.

280
00:16:07.174 --> 00:16:08.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

281
00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think she was pretty?

282
00:16:12.846 --> 00:16:15.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've already established
she looked at least 14.

283
00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:22.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I guess I thought so.
-[Holden] You thought what?

284
00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That she was cute.
-She was precocious, too.

285
00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't mind that you were older.

286
00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She probably kind of liked it.

287
00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:32.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I kind of thought she was into me.

288
00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:36.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When your job ended and you weren't
on that street, you still think about her?

289
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-[Holden] You ever go back by the house,

290
00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
see if she wanted to talk some more?

291
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, she started things, right?

292
00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:44.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kind of.

293
00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:49.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] What about this jacket?

294
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You ever see her wear this?

295
00:16:57.224 --> 00:16:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here, take a closer look.

296
00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:11.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you picked her up from the bus,
was she wearing this jacket?

297
00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:16.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There was a lot of blood
at the crime scene.

298
00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:19.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We haven't revealed too many details,
but Lisa's skull was crushed.

299
00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:21.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That blood goes everywhere.

300
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:25.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In crimes involving blunt force trauma,
it's almost impossible for the attacker

301
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to avoid getting his victim's blood
on him.

302
00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:30.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The scalp has thousands of capillaries.

303
00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:33.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Blood sprays everywhere, like a fine mist.

304
00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:35.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It gets in your hair, up your nose.

305
00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:37.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd be amazed
if you didn't get any on you.

306
00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:40.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He's washed.
-[Tench] What's under your fingernails?

307
00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:42.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Holden] It's just dirt, Bill.
-We should take a sample.

308
00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:44.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He scrubbed his nails by now.

00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:47.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you cleaned your ears?

-[Tench] Can we do that?

311
00:17:49.943 --> 00:17:51.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I can arrange that.

312
00:17:57.701 --> 00:17:58.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

314
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if they haven't done it,
they won't shut up.

315
00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:04.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They protest their innocence.

316
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] Oh, God, yeah. "How dare you?
Fuck you. I know my rights."

317
00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:09.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A guilty guy will clam up,
start listening intently,

318
00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:11.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is what you're doing.

319
00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:13.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] If a guilty guy yells
to make you think he's innocent,

320
00:18:13.842 --> 00:18:16.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Sure can.

321
00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do you keep looking at that rock?

322
00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:22.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
An innocent man would have

323
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's what was used to kill Lisa,
wasn't it?

324
00:18:25.312 --> 00:18:26.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When things got out of hand.

325
00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:29.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You didn't mean to, right?

326
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:33.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She came up to you, she seemed friendly,
and then everything went sideways.

327
00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:37.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The question for us isn't "Did you do it?"
We know that you did it.

328
00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The question for us is...

329
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:40.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Why?"

330
00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:44.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We think we know why, and we understand.

331
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All you have to do is tell us
if we're right.

332
00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:03.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Brassel] Can you teach this stuff?
-We should.

334
00:19:05.602 --> 00:19:08.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bill, why are not we teaching profiling
at the Academy?

335
00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:11.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Because we're still figuring it out.
-[scoffs]

336
00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:13.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Brassel] You like this bourbon?
-Yeah.

337
00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:15.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Brassel] Two more.

338
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, what I can't get over is the rock.

339
00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:20.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He could not control his reaction.

340
00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Everybody has a rock.
-[Brassel] What?

341
00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:24.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something that makes them sweat.

342
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like, for example,
my senior year of college.

343
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:30.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I came home for Christmas, I'm sitting
at the kitchen table with my dad,

344
00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:33.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and my mom brings over some eggnog.

345
00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:36.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And she hands me a glass and she says,

346
00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:40.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Holden, have you had sexual relations
with a woman?"

347
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Jesus, no.
-Yeah.

348
00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:45.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I say, "Uh, yeah, Mom, I have."

349
00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:46.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And she says, "What's her name?"

350
00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:50.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I say, "Well, actually, Mom,
there's been a few."

351
00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:52.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bottoms up.
-[laughs]

352
00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:53.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] And then...

353
00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:58.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! And then she says, "Holden...

354
00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who's going to have you
as a husband now?"

355
00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-I'm telling you,

356
00:20:03.493 --> 00:20:05.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if she asked me that again today,

357
00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:07.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the exact same thing would happen.
I would completely fall apart.

358
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:09.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's your rock.

359
00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:10.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's be clear.

360
00:20:11.418 --> 00:20:14.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All he did was put the killer's
murder weapon in front of him.

361
00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:15.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bill, come on.

362
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:19.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We posited
that the killer might feel guilty.

363
00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:20.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then, I just...

364
00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:25.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
created a situation where the guilt
completely overwhelmed him.

365
00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:26.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] It wasn't guilt.

366
00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:30.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was the pucker of "Oh, shit,
I'm going to the electric chair."

367
00:20:30.187 --> 00:20:32.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Brassel laughs]
-How'd you come up with this stuff?

368
00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:37.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By interviewing Richard Speck,
and Jerry Brudos, and Ed Kemper.

369
00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You talked to them firsthand?
-Uh-huh.

370
00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:43.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we've got Manson and Berkowitz
on the wish list.

371
00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:44.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No shit.

372
00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:46.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Unbelievable.
-[Brassel] What are they like?

373
00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:50.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I don't think I'm speaking
out of turn here when I say...

374
00:20:50.582 --> 00:20:54.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they are fucked up.

375
00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:56.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughing]
-Amen.

376
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:00.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what did you say to him?

377
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:02.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got him talking about
how hot young girls are,

378
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
how they look older than their age.

379
00:21:04.554 --> 00:21:06.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ugh.
-But it was the net effect.

380
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:08.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I laid out everything she had on her,

381
00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:12.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a portrait of the last day
in the life of a 12-year-old girl.

382
00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:14.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you staged it. Like a director.

383
00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:16.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess.

384
00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:18.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only he didn't know
he was playing a role in your drama.

385
00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:20.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is what made it a nail-biter.

386
00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:23.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No one could have scripted
the reveal of the rock.

387
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:25.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He completely freaked.

388
00:21:26.576 --> 00:21:28.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could suddenly smell BO in the room.

389
00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:30.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Pavlovian.
-Guilt.

390
00:21:31.164 --> 00:21:34.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you were convinced he was guilty
before you went in.

391
00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:36.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it was pretty obvious.

392
00:21:36.503 --> 00:21:38.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, but presupposed.

393
00:21:40.173 --> 00:21:41.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Correctly presupposed.

394
00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:45.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it a fair experiment if you're working
backward from a conclusion?

395
00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:47.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If your theory is proven right.

396
00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:51.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Holden, you drove him
to an emotional response.

397
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I helped put a child murderer behind bars.

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:55.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:58.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's right.
-Only Perry Mason never got off on it.

400
00:22:00.193 --> 00:22:02.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Please stop analyzing me.
-I'm not analyzing you.

401
00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:04.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You run this commentary

402
00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:07.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was talking about your work.
That's how we communicate, right?

403
00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You talk about your job,
I give my opinion.

404
00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I don't always want your opinion.

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:14.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Could you just be my girlfriend?

406
00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:15.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could you just listen?

407
00:22:17.544 --> 00:22:19.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mean shut up and adore you?

408
00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:22.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you could try it. Once.

479
00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:22.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have been interviewing extremely
violent offenders. The worst of the worst.

480
00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:24.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

an element of trust

481
00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that they offer information

482
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We try to be objective
because what they have to say is valuable.

483
00:26:31.464 --> 00:26:34.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if they see that our techniques
are being used to eradicate them, then--

484
00:26:34.592 --> 00:26:37.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now how would your techniques
be used for that?

00:26:37.887 --> 00:26:42.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Agent Ford assembled a psychological

00:26:42.225 --> 00:26:44.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

487
00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:47.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So if he's convicted and executed, then--

488
00:26:47.355 --> 00:26:50.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honey, we don't kill criminals.

489
00:26:50.692 --> 00:26:52.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They kill themselves.

490
00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:53.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What does that mean?

491
00:26:53.778 --> 00:26:56.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's their behavior
that puts them in that chair.

492
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, I think it's--

493
00:26:57.782 --> 00:27:01.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I talk to a jury,
I always ask, "Do you watch TV?"

494
00:27:01.202 --> 00:27:02.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Most of them do.

495
00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:04.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I say, "Who watches the cop shows?"

496
00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:08.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right there you know whether
you've got a smart jury or a stupid one.

497
00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:10.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I say, "Forget TV,

498
00:27:10.378 --> 00:27:13.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause it'll never show you
the experience of the victim."

499
00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:14.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-"You will never hear the cries

-on <i>Hawaii Five-O."</i>
-I'm not arguing prosecution strategies.

503
00:27:26.644 --> 00:27:28.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm simply--
-And I'm not done talking.

504
00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:33.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My point is that when you go
from an abstract idea of murder

505
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to the visceral reality,

506
00:27:35.528 --> 00:27:37.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can no longer be objective.

507
00:27:37.947 --> 00:27:40.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only when you feel the pain
of those victims and their loved ones

508
00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:44.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
can you know the magnitude
of the choice that killer made.

509
00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:48.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And it's that choice that seals his fate.
-[Carr] There's no reason to kill people

510
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when we have the wherewithal
to lock them up.

511
00:27:50.835 --> 00:27:53.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These people spend the rest of their lives
in horrendous conditions,

512
00:27:53.922 --> 00:27:56.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which likely reflect the environments
in which they were raised.

513
00:27:56.508 --> 00:28:00.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe-- I'm sorry. But maybe instead
of debating the pros and cons of--

514
00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:02.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, cut to the point.

515
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:06.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you actually asking me
to shoot lower than capital punishment

516
00:28:06.101 --> 00:28:08.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it won't reflect poorly on the FBI?

517
