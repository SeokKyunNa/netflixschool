-Good, huh?
-Mmm!

205
00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These guys are great.

206
00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:38.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been here five years.
We just clicked right off the bat.

207
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You like the guards?

208
00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, they like me. I'm polite.

209
00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:49.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I heard that you used to drink
at the Jury Room.

210
00:13:50.412 --> 00:13:52.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mean in Santa Cruz?

211
00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, those are good guys.

212
00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:58.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I applied to California Highway Patrol.

213
00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:03.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My mom spoke to the cops
to get my psychiatric record expunged.

214
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:07.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Turns out my record didn't bother them
at all, I was just too tall.

215
00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:11.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too tall? [laughs]
I've heard of being too short, but...

216
00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:14.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

217
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing. It just seems...

218
00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think they lied to me?

219
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:21.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

220
00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:26.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, cops like me
because they can talk to me...

221
00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:29.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
more than they can talk
to their own wives, some of them.

222
00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:31.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? What do you talk about?

223
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, books, movies.

224
00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:36.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I watch all the cop shows on TV.

225
00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:37.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know, uh...

226
00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:42.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Joseph Wambaugh,<i> Police Story?</i>
You ever watch that?

227
00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:43.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs] Huge fan.
-Oh.

228
00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got a lot of my insights right there.

229
00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:47.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

230
00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What kind of insights?

231
00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:52.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, so, for example, with cops,

232
00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:54.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would not allow myself
to walk into a trap

233
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:58.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I knew exactly how their minds
worked from watching Wambaugh.

234
00:14:58.772 --> 00:15:00.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What kind of trap are you talking about?

235
00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The classic is talking too much
about the crimes.

236
00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Over-interest.

237
00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:06.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have to remain casual.

238
00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They tried everything to trick me.
I'm too savvy.

239
00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:11.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't fucking talk, period.

240
00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:15.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? That's interesting.

241
00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:16.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So...

242
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you had this idea?

243
00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:20.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Uh, yes.

244
00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:24.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's kind of, uh...

245
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:30.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it's more of a research thing.

246
00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:31.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Research.

247
00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just a series of interviews,

248
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:35.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
chatting with...

249
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
individuals not unlike yourself.

250
00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're just talking?

251
00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't get to go someplace,
do a bunch of tests?

252
00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:48.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. Yeah, no tests. Just right here.

253
00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:49.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

254
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, because I believe
it could be useful.

255
00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:55.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Talking about what?

256
00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:57.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I don't know.

257
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:00.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your...

258
00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:03.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
behavior, I guess.

259
00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:06.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you want to, that is.

260
00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:10.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We don't have to talk about
anything at all if you don't want to.

261
00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:13.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you so tense?

262
00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:14.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Hm?

263
00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:16.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're tense, right now.

264
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:19.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I'm not tense.

265
00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:24.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I'll be honest,
I don't get many visitors.

266
00:16:24.191 --> 00:16:27.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I do, you think
they want to talk about this shit?

267
00:16:28.028 --> 00:16:31.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fuck no. It's like if you worked
at a slaughterhouse with livestock,

268
00:16:31.198 --> 00:16:33.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
real conversation stopper.

269
00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:34.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you?

270
00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:36.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I'm just saying...

271
00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:39.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
People who hunt other people
for a vocation,

272
00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:42.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
all we want to talk about
is what it's like.

273
00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:46.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The shit that went down.
The entire fucked-upness of it.

274
00:16:47.297 --> 00:16:48.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, sure.

275
00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:52.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not easy.
Butchering people is hard work.

276
00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:56.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Physically and mentally.
I don't think people realize.

277
00:16:56.306 --> 00:16:57.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You need to vent.

278
00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:01.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you writing down?

279
00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:05.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I just think it's an interesting
choice of words, "vocation."

280
00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:08.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, what would you call it?

281
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:12.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A hobby? I'd say it's more than that.

282
00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:17.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at the consequences.
The stakes are very high.

283
00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:24.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is this helping?
Are you getting what you came for?

284
00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:25.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think.
-Good.

285
00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:27.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I-- Could I just ask you something?

286
00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you believe that prison can help you?

287
00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:32.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you kidding?

288
00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:35.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think you shouldn't be in prison?

289
00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:39.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's shutting the barn door
after the horse has bolted, somewhat.

290
00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:42.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you think
the state should do with you instead?

291
00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:46.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, Holden,
a lobotomy's not out of the question.

292
00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:47.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lobotomy?

293
00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like Frances Farmer.

294
00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:52.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You remember Frances Farmer?
-No.

295
00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:54.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I loved Frances Farmer.
She was an actress.

296
00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:57.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They lobotomized her in the '50s.

297
00:17:57.117 --> 00:18:02.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was very smart and intense...
very misunderstood. She was a lot like me.

298
00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:05.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't think you could benefit
from psychiatry?

299
00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:08.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I already did all that in the institution.

300
00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It didn't take.

301
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:16.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, I think surgery
might give me the best chance.

302
00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:19.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And if surgery doesn't... take,

303
00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:24.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in this modern society, what do we do
with the Ed Kempers of the world?

304
00:18:25.312 --> 00:18:27.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, isn't that your department?

305
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
From your perspective.

306
00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:38.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Death by torture?

307
00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:00.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ed]<i> So what are you not telling me?</i>

308
00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:03.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

309
00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:05.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Like what?
-Funny.

310
00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:08.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You keep looking at me
like I'm a specimen.

312
00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:16.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just you seem like a nice,
ordinary...

313
00:19:17.614 --> 00:19:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's difficult for me to square you
with what you're in prison for.

314
00:19:22.452 --> 00:19:23.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

315
00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, sure.

316
00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:31.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was a regular guy most of my life,

317
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a nice home, nice suburb.

318
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had pets, I went to a good school.

319
00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:39.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was a thoughtful, educated,
well brought up young person.

320
00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:41.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no question about it.

321
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:43.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But...

322
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:46.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
at the same time...

323
00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:51.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was living a vile, depraved,

324
00:19:51.815 --> 00:19:55.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
filled with debased violence and mayhem,

325
00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:57.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well...

326
00:19:57.821 --> 00:20:02.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it certainly seems to me
like you had your own unusual...

327
00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:06.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An unusual MO. Oh, sure.

328
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:08.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I was gonna say...

329
00:20:09.249 --> 00:20:10.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
signature.

330
00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:12.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An<i> </i>oeuvre<i>,</i> if you will.

331
00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:14.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could study it.

332
00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can spell<i> </i>oeuvre, can't you, Holden?

333
00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:23.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, there's a lot more like me.

334
00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you think so?

335
00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:29.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
People that kill in sequence like you did?

336
00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:31.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sequence?
-One right after another.

337
00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:33.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At regular intervals.

338
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've just been calling them...

339
00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:37.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"sequence killers"...

340
00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:39.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if you will.

341
00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:42.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How many would you say?
-Well...

342
00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it would be a guess,

343
00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:48.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I'd say right now...

344
00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:53.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
North America, more than 35.

345
00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:55.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thirty-five?

346
00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:59.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you're never gonna find them
if they don't want you to. Not even close.

347
00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:01.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That can't be right.

348
00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:05.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, Holden, I'm not an expert.
I'm not an authority.

349
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:08.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just
an extremely accomplished murderer

350
00:21:08.892 --> 00:21:12.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who spent my adult life
successfully evading capture...

351
00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:17.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
until I gave myself up
because I despaired of ever being caught.

352
00:21:19.194 --> 00:21:20.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So take it or leave it.

353
00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:23.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you want from me?

354
00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:24.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

355
00:21:26.743 --> 00:21:28.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no idea.

356
00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:32.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His<i> </i>oeuvre?
What the fuck? He's Stanley Kubrick?

357
00:21:32.332 --> 00:21:34.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was extremely talkative.

358
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:37.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He likes talking to cops.
He's lonely. He could do it all day.

359
00:21:38.046 --> 00:21:40.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's not some frenzied thrill killer,
Bill.

360
00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:42.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think we need to face that.

361
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He chopped off women's heads
and had sex with their corpses.

362
00:21:46.763 --> 00:21:48.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If that's not frenzied,
I don't know what is.

363
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He is so articulate.

364
00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:54.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's meticulous and highly intelligent.

365
00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:59.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, he meticulously chose small, young,
female prey who couldn't fight back.

366
00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:01.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Animal cunning.

367
00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:04.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's self-aware and objective.
Isn't that highly unusual?

368
00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:05.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's saying everything you want to hear,

369
00:22:05.907 --> 00:22:08.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just like he did with the shrinks
in the institution.

370
00:22:08.368 --> 00:22:11.121 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He knew just enough to talk his way out,
then went hunting.

371
00:22:11.204 --> 00:22:14.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't be stupid about this.
-What makes you so sure I'm being stupid?

372
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know these fuckers.

373
00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:18.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's only a matter of time
before he hits you up for privileges.

374
00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:21.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Next, he's complaining to the warden--
-Come with me next weekend.

375
00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:24.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-See for yourself.
-No, I'm not gonna do that.

376
00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:26.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're just going to play golf?

377
00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:30.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It helps me think clearly.
You might want to try it.

378
00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:35.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[panting] Oh, yeah. Up a little.
-[Holden] Uh-huh.

379
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:41.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Over a little. Left.
-My left or your left?

380
00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:42.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My left.

382
00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:46.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This okay?

383
00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:48.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fine. What's wrong?

384
00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:50.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You want a break?
-Why would I want a break?

385
00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:52.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's not how it works.
-All right.

386
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:56.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want me to throw in something?
Play with your nipples?

387
00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:57.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why?
-Move it along.

388
00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:00.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're doing great. Just stop stopping.
-Okay.

390
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He knows more about lust murder

391
00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:07.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
than the whole

392
00:23:07.594 --> 00:23:10.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We should put him on the payroll.
-Would the FBI ever do that?

393
00:23:10.597 --> 00:23:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doubtful.

394
00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:14.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone's freaked out
that Berkowitz might sell his life story.

395
00:23:14.684 --> 00:23:17.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
New York State is moving
to make that sort of thing illegal.

396
00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:19.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'd be awful
for the families of the victims.

-Hi.

398
00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:23.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, can I get two eggs over medium,

399
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
home-fried potatoes,
and wheat toast with grape jelly?

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Uh...

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:31.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-A what?

402
00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:35.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-An <i>egg </i>salad sandwich. Thank you.
-Holden, you don't even like egg salad.

403
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[waitress] Thank you.
-Right. Um...

404
00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:40.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll just have a Denver omelet.

405
00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:44.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got mention-itis.
You cannot stop mentioning him.

406
00:23:44.631 --> 00:23:47.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think of how much we can learn
from a guy like Kemper.

407
00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:50.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He called it a vocation.

408
00:23:50.178 --> 00:23:51.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Killing women?
-Yeah.

409
00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:53.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jesus. How do you wrap your mind
around that?

410
00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:56.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Couldn't attract them.

411
00:23:56.518 --> 00:23:58.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't have the social skills.

412
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That would describe a lot of guys.

413
00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:02.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why does he hate women?

414
00:24:03.483 --> 00:24:04.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should ask.

415
00:24:04.901 --> 00:24:07.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But not outright.
-No?

416
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:10.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He sounds like the kind of person

00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:17.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

419
00:24:18.748 --> 00:24:21.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:31.261 --> 00:24:33.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

424
00:24:33.263 --> 00:24:35.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

426
00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:41.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want him to like you,

00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:44.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you don't want him to think
you're gonna fuck him.

428
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:19.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

453
00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:52.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

454
00:25:54.469 --> 00:25:56.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

457
00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:05.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You gotta make it with that young pussy

458
00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:09.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

459
00:26:11.778 --> 00:26:15.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you were a virgin up until then,
that's what you're saying?

460
00:26:15.156 --> 00:26:18.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, not at all.
-Oh, you go over like you're a virgin.

461
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

462
00:26:20.954 --> 00:26:22.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was a virgin for years.

463
00:26:22.289 --> 00:26:25.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no, there's nothing wrong with it,
it's just I'm... not.

464
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh-huh.

465
00:26:27.627 --> 00:26:30.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This new girl, she take it up the ass?

466
00:26:33.508 --> 00:26:35.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We haven't really discussed it.

467
00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:36.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ask her.

468
00:26:36.678 --> 00:26:39.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
An asshole will suck your cock right in,
literally.

469
00:26:40.056 --> 00:26:41.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a hole that sucks.

470
00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:43.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[makes slurping sound] It's easy.

471
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:47.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But when you fuck somebody in the neck,
it's entirely the opposite.

472
00:26:47.814 --> 00:26:51.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's nothing but resistance.
It's really difficult.

473
00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:52.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me.

474
00:26:53.028 --> 00:26:54.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You feel this?

475
00:26:54.612 --> 00:26:56.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feel it. It's all muscle.

476
00:26:56.698 --> 00:26:58.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cartilaginous.

477

478
00:27:01.911 --> 00:27:03.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this interesting?

479
00:27:03.747 --> 00:27:07.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, yeah.
-Because I can skip some of the detail.

480
00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:09.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I'm here for the detail.

481
00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:12.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A major college campus.

482
00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:16.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like a giant candy store,
you know what I mean.

483
00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:17.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

484
00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:23.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your, uh, your mom worked on campus
at UCSC, right?

485
00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remind me again what she did.

486
00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:31.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Administrative assistant.

487
00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:38.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's all she lived for, man,
her work and her precious coeds,

488
00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:40.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
whom she mothered relentlessly.

489
00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:43.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think
that she neglected you for them?

490
00:27:43.912 --> 00:27:45.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Put it this way,

491
00:27:45.872 --> 00:27:49.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she had a very violently
outspoken position on men.

492
00:27:51.252 --> 00:27:53.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She had a failed marriage with my father.

493
00:27:53.755 --> 00:27:55.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I looked a lot like him, so...

494
00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:57.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You reminded her of him.

495
00:28:00.261 --> 00:28:03.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think you developed a dislike
for young women as a result?

496
00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:05.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As far as she was concerned,

497
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was never going to end up
with one of those girls

498
00:28:10.563 --> 00:28:12.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I was a fuckup
and an embarrassment.

499
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:15.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You were a failure in her eyes.
-Look.

500
00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:19.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My mother was a decent, upstanding,
reasonable woman,

501
00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:21.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but when it came to me,

502
00:28:21.991 --> 00:28:24.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
she had nothing but contempt,

503
00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:26.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
disappointment, and disdain.

504
00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:30.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That must've been awful.

505
00:28:31.626 --> 00:28:33.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, here's the thing.

506
00:28:37.632 --> 00:28:38.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm listening.

507
00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:46.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Women are born with this little hole
between their legs...

508
00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:50.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which every man on earth
just wants to stick something into.

509
00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they're weaker than men,

510
00:28:55.108 --> 00:28:57.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so they learn strategies.

511
00:28:57.485 --> 00:29:00.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They deploy their minds and their sex,

512
00:29:00.613 --> 00:29:03.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they intuitively learn to humiliate.

513
00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:08.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did your mother humiliate you?

514
00:29:14.043 --> 00:29:15.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ed?

515
00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:21.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[buzzer sounds]

516

517
00:29:36.024 --> 00:29:38.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Lust murder doesn't cut it.

518
00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:42.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He did not stab, and rape, and decapitate
Mom because he was aroused.

519
00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:44.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was conditioned to do it.

520
00:29:44.532 --> 00:29:46.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did he say that?
-As good as.

521
00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:48.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's schtick.

522
00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:50.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He learned the vernacular
in the institution.

523

00:35:52.525 --> 00:35:54.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you remember anything else?

628
00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:55.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was he big, little?

629
00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:59.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you remember any moles, scars,
tattoos, distinctive marks?

630
00:36:00.074 --> 00:36:01.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I remember moonlight.

631
00:36:03.744 --> 00:36:04.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And...

632
00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do remember a smell.

633
00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:12.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What kind of smell?

634
00:36:12.753 --> 00:36:14.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosemary] I don't know, he just...

635
00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He stank.
-[Tench] Like what?

636
00:36:18.885 --> 00:36:21.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Grease or gasoline, fertilizer?

637
00:36:21.137 --> 00:36:22.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosemary] Like a bum.

638
00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:24.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like somebody who needed to wash.

639
00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:28.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Seventeen, eighteen-year-old
high school kid,

640
00:36:28.603 --> 00:36:31.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
low self-esteem, hates authority,

641
00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:33.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
doesn't get along well with his parents.

642
00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:35.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What, just some punk?

643
00:36:35.818 --> 00:36:37.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gets into a fight
with his old man one night,

644
00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:42.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
maybe he gets a hold of a bottle of liquor
and comes across the house,

645
00:36:42.658 --> 00:36:46.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
recognizes the place because he cut
the grass there when he was younger.

646
00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:48.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Some neighborhood kid?
-[Holden] He goes inside.

647
00:36:48.956 --> 00:36:52.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She doesn't recognize him,
thinks he's broken in, and starts yelling.

648
00:36:52.835 --> 00:36:54.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The fight gets physical.

649
00:36:54.462 --> 00:36:57.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's drunk, he beats the shit out of her.

650
00:36:58.216 --> 00:37:02.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He knifes the dog
because the dog is yapping its head off.

651
00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:04.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then he runs.

652
00:37:05.264 --> 00:37:07.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you guys serious? A teenager?

653
00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:09.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He has bad hygiene.

654
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doesn't bathe
because bathing is what his parents want.

655
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:16.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, we got a lot of kids like that
around here.

656
00:37:17.652 --> 00:37:20.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But what kind of degenerate
carves up a little dog?

657
00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:22.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe the kid saw the dog in the yard,

658
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
decided to conduct a moonlight experiment
with his Bowie knife, gets interrupted.

659
00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:30.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A careful, considerate old lady
would bring her dog in at night.

660
00:37:30.289 --> 00:37:33.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She went outside with the dog
because she heard something.

661
00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carver] Listen.

662
00:37:35.628 --> 00:37:37.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a harvest moon.

663
00:37:38.714 --> 00:37:42.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have been tossing the idea around
that maybe it's one of these, uh...

664
00:37:42.385 --> 00:37:44.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you know, satanic deals.

665
00:37:44.303 --> 00:37:47.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, like maybe the dog is some kind
of ritual sacrifice or something.

666
00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:48.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[inhales sharply]

667
00:37:49.141 --> 00:37:50.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Check.

668
00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:55.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to squeeze
the neighborhood kids.

669
00:37:55.731 --> 00:37:56.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One of them knows something.

670
00:37:57.024 --> 00:37:59.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We had a kid like that,
brought him in for questioning twice.

671
00:37:59.735 --> 00:38:00.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bring him in again.

672
00:38:00.861 --> 00:38:02.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're gonna get pushback
from the family.

673
00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:04.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His aunt works for the county.

674
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Then make it formal.
-I'm probably gonna need a warrant.

675
00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:09.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We might be able to help you with that.

676
00:38:16.335 --> 00:38:17.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fuck!

677
00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:23.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nancy's gonna kill me.
We can't get a flight till Sunday.

678
00:38:27.013 --> 00:38:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Maybe this kid's like Kemper.
-We have to get a room.

679
00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:32.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can take care of the room.
We can turn this into an opportunity.

680
00:38:32.893 --> 00:38:36.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It could help with the Gonzales case.
-I can't believe I'm stuck with you.

681
00:38:36.188 --> 00:38:38.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We can talk to Kemper.
-No!

682
00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm gonna play golf.
-Come with me.

683
00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:42.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not consulting with Ed Kemper.

684
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not to consult. Just background.

685
00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:46.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When did his behavior escalate?

686
00:38:46.365 --> 00:38:48.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't stay away
from that motherfucker, can you?

687
00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:50.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, please. Don't say "motherfucker."

688
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know that he'll respond
to your seniority.

689
00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:56.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You could really smoke him out.
-No, not now.

690
00:38:56.792 --> 00:38:59.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're stuck here all weekend.
What else are you gonna do?

691
00:39:01.088 --> 00:39:02.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I said forget about it, man.

692
00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:05.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

693
00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:07.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[buzzer sounds]

694
00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:18.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, you're the big boss, right?

695
00:39:18.397 --> 00:39:21.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I established
the Behavioral Science Unit years ago,

696
00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:23.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but Holden's come in
with a lot of new ideas.

697
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:27.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So Holden's
the intrepid rookie investigator?

698
00:39:27.406 --> 00:39:30.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bill taught me everything I know
about criminal behavior.

699
00:39:30.409 --> 00:39:33.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that right?
Well, let me ask you something, Bill.

700
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:35.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you think
about Joseph Wambaugh?

701
00:39:36.082 --> 00:39:38.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He knows Joe. Right, Bill?

702
00:39:39.502 --> 00:39:40.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well...

703
00:39:40.503 --> 00:39:43.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually,
he based a lot of that stuff on Bill.

704
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No shit.
-Uh-huh.

705
00:39:46.926 --> 00:39:49.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Not the, uh, stories,

706
00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:52.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the psychological insights
and the vernacular.

707
00:39:52.681 --> 00:39:53.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

708
00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:55.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is fascinating.

709
00:39:56.268 --> 00:39:59.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I sure would love
to pick your brain sometime.

710
00:39:59.105 --> 00:40:00.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that's another life sentence
right there.

711
00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:03.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-[Holden] Maybe you could, uh...

712
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:06.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
talk about your background
a little bit with Bill.

713
00:40:06.654 --> 00:40:10.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe tell him the thing
that you told me the other day

714
00:40:10.449 --> 00:40:11.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
about your mother.

715
00:40:13.953 --> 00:40:15.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My mother.

716
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:20.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you see, Bill,

717
00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:24.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
even as a child,
I had kind of a rich fantasy life.

718
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:30.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As a teenager,
I began by cutting up inanimate objects.

719
00:40:30.177 --> 00:40:32.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
G.I. Joe. My sister's dolls.

720
00:40:32.388 --> 00:40:35.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ripping their heads off,
cutting up the bodies.

721
00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:37.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mutilating them, if you will.

722
00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:40.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You had fantasies of what, real women?

723
00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:41.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ed] Oh, yeah.

724
00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:45.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And my mother would yell
and scream at me, tell me I was sick.

725
00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:48.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She thought I was going to do
something hideous one day.

726
00:40:49.029 --> 00:40:50.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did she think you were gonna do?

727
00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess rape my sister or something.

728
00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is when I was ten years old.

729
00:40:58.122 --> 00:40:58.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice.

730
00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:01.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not exactly<i> The Brady Bunch.</i>

731
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] Why do you think she thought this?

732
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
