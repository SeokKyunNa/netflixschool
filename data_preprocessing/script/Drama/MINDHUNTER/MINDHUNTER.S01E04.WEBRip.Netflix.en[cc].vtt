106
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

107
00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:43.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She sends me a letter.

108

110
00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:56.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She tells me, in so many words,
she wants to ball other guys.

111
00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:59.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What am I supposed to do with that?

112
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hop in the car, gotta see it

113
00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:06.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
there she is, making out with some dork.

114
00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

115
00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:11.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chicks.

116
00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What can you do?

117
00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:18.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't live with them. [snickers]

118
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll tell you what you can fucking do.

119
00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I get some beer,

120
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have some weed,

121
00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:30.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I'm smoking, and thinking,

122
00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:34.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

123
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I'm back at my apartment,

124
00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:39.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in the parking lot,

125
00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
no idea how I got there.

126
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A car pulls into the lot.

127
00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:49.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Girl on her own, maybe 20, 25.

128
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got to be four in the morning.

129
00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:55.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like...

130
00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the idea of doing it

131
00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
pops in your head like a...

132
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

133
00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:07.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like a sneeze, you know what I mean?

134
00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:11.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hop out the car, tap on the window,

135
00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:13.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
pull the gun,

136
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
drag her into the woods,

137
00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
rip her fucking panties off,
hike up her skirt.

138
00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:21.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Oh, yeah, give it to me, baby!
I want it, I'm so horny."

139
00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to rape her,
but she won't shut up.

140
00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She takes off screaming,

141
00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:28.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
runs through the parking lot,
down a ravine.

142
00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, she's stronger than me,
but I'm fast.

143
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I catch up to her.
I get her in a headlock.

144
00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:36.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I choke her.

145
00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:40.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We go rolling down the hill into a stream.
The whole thing is fucking chaos.

146
00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:42.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I smash her head against a rock,

147
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
hold her underwater...

148
00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:48.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that's that.

149
00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No more drama.

150
00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You had a gun, why not use it?

151
00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanted to cool her off.

152
00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you think-- Pardon me.

153
00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think it would've ended differently
if she hadn't...

154
00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Like, if she wasn't--
-[Monte] Wasn't what?

155
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:09.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A fucking prostitute?

156
00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:13.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, could be. Could be.

157
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your science buddy
might have something there.

158
00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:24.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Second time, this blonde chick,
she will not stop with the questions.

159
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have her driving at gunpoint,
and she's like,

160
00:11:26.977 --> 00:11:29.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Why are you doing this?
Don't you have a girlfriend?

161
00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you planning to do? Why me?"

162
00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:33.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that why you stabbed her?

163
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had to.

164
00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:37.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut her the fuck up.

165
00:11:37.905 --> 00:11:40.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] Then you drove around for hours
in her car.

166
00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:43.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

167
00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By the third girl, you could say
I had, uh... perfected the routine.

168
00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:49.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You stabbed her, too?

169
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

170
00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:55.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I stabbed her so many times.

171
00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeesh...

172
00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[clicks tongue]
I did let one of 'em go, though.

173
00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

174
00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're in the car, I'm getting ready,
she has no idea.

175
00:12:09.937 --> 00:12:13.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All of a sudden she starts crying,
out of nowhere.

176
00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:16.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tells me her daddy's dying... Cancer.

177
00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:21.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My brother had cancer.

178
00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:24.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cancer. It's, uh...

179
00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bitch, man.

180
00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:29.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's hard on a human being.

181
00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I let her go.

182
00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:34.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's, uh...

183
00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a weird feeling, man.
-What's a weird feeling, Monte?

184
00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um...

185
00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:43.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do I put it?

186
00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Showing mercy.
-[Tench] What?

187
00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:50.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, kid. You don't expect us
to buy your mercy horseshit.

188
00:12:50.644 --> 00:12:53.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think what Agent Tench means is--

189
00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:55.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I've had enough science
for one day.

190
00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:58.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Throat's a little dry.

191
00:13:33.103 --> 00:13:35.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Maybe next time you should be careful--
-Holden.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:38.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I didn't say anything.
-You don't have to. I get it.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's move on.
-I wasn't going to reprimand you.

00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:41.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope not.

195
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

He's an Olympic-class bullshitter.

200
00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:09.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do we think
he's being honest with us?

201
00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:12.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

he's being completely honest. Do we?

202
00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:17.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We just need to extract what's useful

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:19.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-You were speeding!

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Doesn't matter?

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:46.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-The law?!

215
00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:48.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No. Here's the fucking law, pal!
-You can't do that.

216
00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna call the police!

217
00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stay away from me, man!

218
00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unbelievable!

219
00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:58.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] You fucking moron.

220
00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:03.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You sure you're all right?

[Holden] No, I get it. You got a lot
going on. It's a lot of pressure.

224
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I completely understand.

225
00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let me talk to Bill
and I'll call you back.

226
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

227
00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:40.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that for me?

228
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks. Debbie says hi.

229
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's fine. As soon as class is over,
she'll come down.

230
00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:54.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She says she'd rather us get a room
so she can pick us up in the morning.

231
00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a little ticked off.

232
00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:00.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I get Debbie doesn't want to do
all that driving,

233
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but we have a situation here.
I'm asking her for help.

234
00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, she's got midterms
and that's on her mind, but...

235
00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:09.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

236
00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why am I so upset?

237
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:16.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe 'cause she can't drop everything
when you call.

238
00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:20.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because she doesn't want to.

239
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[man] Here you go.

240
00:16:27.569 --> 00:16:29.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-One more, please.
-[man] Yes, sir.

241
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:31.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want to call Nancy?

242
00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:32.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

245
00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:47.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you okay?

246
00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:50.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or we could just eat.

247
00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't see it coming, Holden.

248
00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:01.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could've been killed,
and I didn't see it coming.

249
00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:09.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's one thing if it's the job.

250
00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:12.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But some fucking Pinto
comes shooting out of nowhere...

251
00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:15.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think if I called Nancy,

252
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:17.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if I heard her voice,

253
00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:19.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd just lose it.

254
00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:26.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, we adopted a boy...

255
00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:29.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
three years ago.

256
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's six now.

257
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nancy always wanted a family.

258
00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:38.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I guess I did, too.

259
00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:44.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we can't have kids of our own, so...

260
00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:46.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not going well.

261
00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's a beautiful boy.

262
00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:56.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At first, I thought he was just quiet,
you know, a quiet baby,

263
00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
nothing wrong with that.

264
00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:00.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He can speak,

265
00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:03.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he just won't.

266
00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel like we're failing him somehow.

267
00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:12.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sure you're not.

268
00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe he was like this before.

269
00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:17.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's a real strain.

270
00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:22.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's supposed to be this great thing,
having a son.

271
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God, Bill.

272
00:18:25.145 --> 00:18:27.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry to hear that.

273
00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:29.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When the car was spinning out, I just...

274
00:18:33.403 --> 00:18:35.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have no idea what I'm trying to say,
do you?

275
00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:37.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not exactly...

276
00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:41.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I want to.

277
00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:42.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know either.

278
00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's nothing, it's fine.

279
00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:46.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seriously, Bill...

280
00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:48.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Call Debbie.

281
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tell her she can come get us
in the morning.

282
00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:08.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench on tape]<i> Come on, kid.</i>

283
00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:10.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>You don't expect us to buy</i>
<i>your mercy horseshit.</i>

284
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:14.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden]
<i>I think what Agent Tench means is--</i>

285
00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Monte]<i> I think I've had enough science</i>
<i>for one day.</i>

286
00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:30.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, should we hear it again?
-Eventually, yeah.

287
00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:38.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. So there are two triggers,
one right after the other, for Rissell.

288
00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:40.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe trigger is the wrong word.
Too facile.

289
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:42.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Also, in law enforcement,
has more than one meaning.

290
00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:44.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about stresses? Stressors.

291
00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:47.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's make that our term of art.

292
00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:50.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stress is more internal anyway.
It's more appropriate to our focus.

293
00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:51.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, two stressors set Rissell off?

294
00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:53.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her letter, obviously.

295
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, the girlfriend writes him
a Dear John letter and he--

296
00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:57.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rissell cracks.

297
00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:00.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But he doesn't call her or write back.
-No, he goes down there.

298
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:02.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stalks her like a hunter.
-[Holden] Not like a hunter.

299
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He doesn't kill the girlfriend,
he only watches her with her new beau.

300
00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:08.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Big difference.
-"Beau"?

301
00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:11.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what if Rissell doesn't mean to kill
anyone at this point?

302
00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:12.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's still on track for rape,

303
00:20:12.836 --> 00:20:14.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it's this first victim's compliance

304
00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:17.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that just kind of pushes him
over the edge.

305
00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He kills the first one
because she likes it or pretends to?

306
00:20:19.843 --> 00:20:21.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] It's dominoes.

307
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her compliance makes him angry.

308
00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:24.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He throws her out of the car,
she tries to escape.

309
00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:27.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where is it? He says,
"The whole thing is just fucking chaos."

310
00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:30.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He needed to reassert control.
-Exactly.

311
00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which means that the victim's behavior
is also a stressor.

312
00:20:34.524 --> 00:20:37.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, it may be that they can't change
the ultimate outcome,

313
00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:39.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they can affect
when and how it happens.

314
00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:42.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Exactly what I was thinking,
which is why I asked the question.

315
00:20:42.157 --> 00:20:43.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But... [sighs]

316
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:44.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what?

317
00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:46.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't that just life?

318
00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:48.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your girlfriend dumps you?

319
00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:50.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're trying to be intimate with someone,
and it goes wrong?

320
00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:54.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, not that wrong, but it seems
like Rissell just couldn't hack life.

321
00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:57.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, what else is a criminal except
somebody who can't function in society?

322
00:20:57.798 --> 00:20:59.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we want to be reductive,

323
00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:01.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we can say these men can't handle
normal stages of development--

324
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do I get the sense
"reductive" is your worst insult?

325
00:21:04.554 --> 00:21:06.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not at all. I meant to say you were right.

326
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How would most men feel
if they were being intimate with a woman

327
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they sensed
that she wasn't enjoying herself?

328
00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, be scientists.

329
00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:21.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Disappointed.

330
00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:24.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It would feel awful.
-Right.

331
00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:26.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want her to have a good time.

332
00:21:26.743 --> 00:21:29.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carr] But when Rissell sensed
that his victim was enjoying herself,

333
00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it turned him into a murderer.

334
00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:34.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, yes, what happens to these men
is normal,

335
00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:35.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the way that they process it is not.

336
00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:39.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's our goal, to dig into the why,
like you did with Kemper.

337
00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:41.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] We're headed to Altoona
for Road School.

338
00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:43.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll try and see Rissell again
when we get back, if he'll see us.

339
00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:47.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is gonna take twice as long
if you can't do the interviews full-time.

340
00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:51.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What is it? A question of money,
of institutional rigidity,

341
00:21:51.184 --> 00:21:52.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
scheduling, what?

342
00:21:52.227 --> 00:21:53.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All of the above.

343
00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:56.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I've been in academia
all my life, let me see what I can do.

344
00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:11.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honey, I gotta go.

345
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nancy] Brian.

346
00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:18.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on.

347
00:22:18.378 --> 00:22:20.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give your father a hug.

348
00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:21.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say goodbye.

349
00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:36.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] See you soon, son.

350
00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:01.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ready?

351
00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:03.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep.

352
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:07.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] All yours.

353
00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:12.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[buzzer sounding]
-[sighs]

354
00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:14.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Monte] Ain't easy to get
on the East Coast.

355
00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:16.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it's not.

356
00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:18.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you're not from the East Coast,
originally?

357
00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:24.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

358
00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:28.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, I missed that.
I'm a little deaf.

359
00:23:28.532 --> 00:23:31.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was just asking if you consider yourself
an East Coaster?

360
00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:32.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't have that in your file?

361
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:36.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were born in Wellington,
South Kansas.

362
00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:38.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're the youngest of three,

363
00:23:38.166 --> 00:23:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and your parents divorced
when you were seven.

364
00:23:40.043 --> 00:23:43.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's all in the file,
just not what you have to say about it.

365
00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:46.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, my mom blamed that on me.
No idea why.

366
00:23:46.883 --> 00:23:48.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My brother and sister were around,

367
00:23:48.718 --> 00:23:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it was always on me
when things went bad.

368
00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:54.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pretty soon after,
Mom up and married Hank.

369
00:23:55.684 --> 00:23:58.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Dragged us out to Sacramento.
-You wanted to stay in Kansas?

370
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Monte] Be with my real father? You bet.

371
00:24:00.647 --> 00:24:03.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did not want to be in California,
that's for sure.

372
00:24:05.652 --> 00:24:06.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobody wanted me there, either.

373
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:09.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did your mother say
she didn't want you there?

374
00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why you always want to do that after?

375
00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:20.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crush the can.

376
00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:21.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It feels good.

377
00:24:23.086 --> 00:24:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, maybe.

378
00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:26.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What made you think
nobody wanted you in California?

379
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Monte] Mom wanted to be with Hank.

380
00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:30.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Hank didn't want to raise
somebody else's kids,

381
00:24:30.927 --> 00:24:32.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so he bought us shit.

382
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:38.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thought that'd be enough.
When I was seven, he bought me a gun.

383
00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:41.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He bought you a gun?
-BB gun.

384
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:46.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My brother and sister were drinking,
smoking a lot of weed,

385
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:47.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
doing all kinds of shit.

386
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sometimes they'd share.

387
00:24:52.115 --> 00:24:55.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I was nine,
I shot my cousin in the ass with that gun.

388
00:24:55.118 --> 00:24:58.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That made me star of the show. I mean,
everybody fucking hated my cousin.

389
00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:01.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you kids were left all alone.

390
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hank broke the fucking thing over my head.

391
00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:05.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Tench] He beat you?
-Yeah.

392
00:25:06.713 --> 00:25:07.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's how I burst my eardrum.

393
00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:13.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got into all kinds of shit, man.

394
00:25:14.471 --> 00:25:17.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Broke into some lady's house,
stole a hundred bucks.

395
00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:21.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mom and Hank divorced when I was 12,
that was kind of my doing.

396
00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:25.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fourteen, things got a little worse.

397
00:25:25.232 --> 00:25:28.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Burglary, larceny, car theft, rape twice.

398
00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:31.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My mom somehow got them
to send me to Florida.

399
00:25:32.989 --> 00:25:34.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks, Ma!

400
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:41.373 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I get back. I'm 17, living on my own,
working double shifts at Pizza Hut.

401
00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:44.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobody wanted me, man.

402
00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:49.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobody on this earth ever wanted me.

403
00:25:51.424 --> 00:25:53.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Put that on your fucking tape.

404
00:25:55.553 --> 00:25:57.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If only they'd let me stay with my dad...

405
00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:00.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it'd all be different.

406
00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:02.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might even be a lawyer.

407
00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:06.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So your dad wanted you?
-[Monte] Have a nice car.

408
00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:08.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
House.

409
00:26:08.858 --> 00:26:12.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Be out in the backyard
perfecting my recipe for barbecue.

410
00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:16.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd have found my way.

411
00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:35.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So Rissell's the real victim here?

412
00:26:35.969 --> 00:26:37.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's how he sees it, sure.

413
00:26:38.513 --> 00:26:42.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A pathological liar who murdered
five women sees himself as the victim.

414
00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:46.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we're giving him a shoulder to cry on.

415
00:26:46.646 --> 00:26:48.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're not giving him a shoulder to cry on.

416
00:26:49.232 --> 00:26:51.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're not flattering him. Or helping him.

417
00:26:53.069 --> 00:26:54.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're using him.

418
00:27:02.912 --> 00:27:03.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, okay.

419
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] Motive, means, opportunity.

420
00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:12.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The three pillars of criminal
investigation: what, why, who.

421
00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:13.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened...

422
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:16.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I'm involved
in a hostage negotiation,

423
00:27:16.634 --> 00:27:18.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the perpetrator is standing
right in front of me.

424
00:27:18.845 --> 00:27:21.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[indistinct chatter]

425
00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:33.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not a bad group tonight.
-Yeah.

426
00:27:36.988 --> 00:27:38.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] We got one?

427
00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:42.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at him just standing there,
watching us.

428
00:27:42.285 --> 00:27:44.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's just having a cigarette
before he heads home.

429
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See how he's deliberately trying
not to look at us?

430
00:27:51.294 --> 00:27:53.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's screwing up the nerve to approach.

431
00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:56.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I put the over-under at half a minute.
-I'll definitely take under.

432
00:27:57.467 --> 00:27:59.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's a bet.
-Loser buys dinner.

433
00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:03.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look out, he's on the move.

434
00:28:09.062 --> 00:28:09.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey.

435
00:28:11.564 --> 00:28:13.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys mind if I bother you a minute?

436
00:28:13.566 --> 00:28:14.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure. What's up?

437
00:28:15.693 --> 00:28:17.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beverly Jean Shaw, 22.

438
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Never came home
from her babysitting job.

439
00:28:20.824 --> 00:28:24.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Four days later, we find her in the dump
on Wopsononock Mountain.

440
00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:28.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um, based on stomach contents,
we think she was killed right away,

441
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
around midnight Wednesday.

442
00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:34.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was sitting like this at the dump
for four days?

443
00:28:34.754 --> 00:28:36.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, no, um...

444
00:28:38.174 --> 00:28:40.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See, there wasn't enough, um...

445
00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:43.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If she had been at the dump four days--

446
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:45.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'd see more insect infestation
and animal trauma.

447
00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:48.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, between when she was murdered
on Wednesday

448
00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:50.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the body was discovered
four days later,

449
00:28:50.687 --> 00:28:51.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
she had to be someplace else?

450
00:28:54.274 --> 00:28:55.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Her breasts.

451
00:28:56.526 --> 00:28:59.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They were, I guess you'd say... amputated.

452
00:29:00.613 --> 00:29:04.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Um, we have not been able to locate them.
-Was this postmortem or...

453
00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:07.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[officer] Coroner said she was
already dead. Yes, sir.

454
00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:08.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales] He blacked both her eyes,

455
00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:12.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
broke her jaw, multiple stab wounds.

456
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:15.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can see he kind of
frogged her legs out there.

457
00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:18.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

458
00:29:18.882 --> 00:29:20.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And there was, um...

459
00:29:31.728 --> 00:29:32.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

460
00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:35.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We don't get this kind of thing.

461
00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:37.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's hard to--
-Take your time.

462
00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:45.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There was an incision. From her--
[clears throat]

463
00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:50.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
From her vagina to her, um... anus.

464
00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:55.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-God damn it. I'm sorry.
-You're doing fine.

465
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:58.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The family local?
-Uh...

466
00:29:58.463 --> 00:29:59.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Parents upstate. Fiancé in town.

467
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:05.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You don't think somebody local did this?
-Hard to say at this point.

468
00:30:06.596 --> 00:30:08.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I go to church with these people.

469
00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:11.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We get peeping Toms, sure.
But something like this?

470
00:30:11.267 --> 00:30:12.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn't make sense.

471
00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:16.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To go from shoplifters
and underage kids buying beer to...

472
00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:22.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
what happened to Beverly...
Has to be an outsider.

473
00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:24.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Draped over the ironing board here,
is that human hair?

474
00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:27.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, sir.

475
00:30:27.742 --> 00:30:28.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have it?

476
00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:31.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

477
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:33.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, Forensics bagged it up.

478
00:30:33.957 --> 00:30:36.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all about Forensics.
I am starting to appreciate that.

479
00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:38.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] And the ironing board,
you take that as well?

480
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:42.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, I mean, we dusted it for fingerprints
and everything, but, uh...

481
00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:47.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you do think the unsub scalped Beverly
and then draped it over the ironing board?

482
00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:49.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That mean something?

483
00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:53.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything in this photo has meaning.

484
00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:55.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the unsub meant to display the hair,
he was saying something.

485
00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:59.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He could've put the hair anywhere.
-Right, no, I get it now. Uh...

486
00:30:59.357 --> 00:31:01.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Soon as Forensics confirms
it's Beverly's hair--

487
00:31:01.484 --> 00:31:02.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, what?

488
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:05.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, we shouldn't jump ahead
of Forensics, am I right?

489
00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:08.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] I think, in this case, we have
a dead body missing a chunk of hair,

490
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:11.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a big chunk of hair nearby,
so we can go out on a limb and assume--

491
00:31:11.911 --> 00:31:14.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think what Agent Ford is trying to say,
in his own way,

492
00:31:14.497 --> 00:31:17.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is we're behind the eight ball here,
we've come late to the party.

493
00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:19.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're gonna have to go over ground
you've covered:

494
00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:21.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
witnesses, crime scene.

495
00:31:21.462 --> 00:31:24.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We don't mean that as a challenge to you.
It's not any kind of a criticism.

496
00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:27.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're just trying to catch up.
Am I right, Agent Ford?

497
00:31:30.847 --> 00:31:31.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely.

498
00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:35.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We may ask some obvious questions
and maybe a few you haven't thought of.

499
00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:38.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's not a contest or a competition.
We're all on the same side.

500
00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay?
-Sure.

501
00:31:41.858 --> 00:31:43.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go through the rest.

502
00:31:43.484 --> 00:31:46.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm curious why you're cutting this guy
so much slack.

503
00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:50.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's never seen this kind of thing before.
He's rattled. It's not his fault.

504
00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:55.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Without a doubt you have more experience,
but why rub it in his face?

505
00:31:56.831 --> 00:31:58.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not trying to make you feel bad.

506
00:31:58.958 --> 00:32:00.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe a little.

507
00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:04.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The point is, local cops want to catch
their guy as much as we do, maybe more.

508
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For them, it's not just theoretical,
it's where they live.

509
00:32:16.893 --> 00:32:18.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is where your focus should be.

510
00:32:19.145 --> 00:32:23.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not on the crime scene, not on the corpse,
not on the schematics.

511
00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:26.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Focus on Beverly.

512
00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:28.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did the killer see in her?

513
00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've learned that this is
a crucial detail, and not the only one.

514
00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:33.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Based on the facts
Detective Ocasek laid out earlier,

515
00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:36.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
our methodology tells us
we're looking for a white male.

516
00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These crimes rarely cross racial lines.

517
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's probably around Beverly's age.

518
00:32:41.167 --> 00:32:44.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A killer will usually choose someone
smaller and weaker than himself.

519
00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:46.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's a loner, hunts at night.

520
00:32:46.714 --> 00:32:49.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, "hunts"?
Is that a figure of speech?

521
00:32:50.343 --> 00:32:51.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is not.

522
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Coroner's report said Beverly
was killed and then butchered.

523
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:55.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't that what hunters do?

524
00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:58.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're probably looking for a loner.

525
00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:02.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These men like to explore
the fantasy first,

526
00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:04.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It gives them a certain...
attitude towards women.

00:33:07.735 --> 00:33:09.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hence, a loner.

529
00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:12.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Close-knit community like this,
you would've spotted that by now.

530
00:33:12.115 --> 00:33:14.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think our man is an outsider,
probably a drifter.

531
00:33:14.575 --> 00:33:17.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Most likely, he'll move on from here
and kill again.

532
00:33:17.453 --> 00:33:18.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Again?

533
00:33:36.806 --> 00:33:40.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The killer thought of Beverly Jean
as just another piece of trash.

534
00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:44.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Folks loved Beverly Jean.
Trusted her with their kids.

535
00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:48.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Had to be a drifter, like you say.

536
00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:50.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] Some stranger
passing through town.

537
00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:52.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All that pretty hair caught his eye.

538
00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:54.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He needed to possess it, then destroy it.

539
00:33:56.993 --> 00:33:58.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] You talk to the fiancé?

540
00:33:58.286 --> 00:34:01.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's only so much you can get
out of a man in that state.

541
00:34:02.081 --> 00:34:05.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Benjamin was still in shock.
Gotta take all that into account.

542
00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:09.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I'm sure you know your people,
but let's just cover our bases.

543
00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:12.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And let's try to get him cold.
Make some excuse when you call.

544
00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:15.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't mention the FBI, or even the murder.

545
00:34:15.595 --> 00:34:17.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

546
00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:19.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Soon as Benjamin gets back into town.

00:34:19.766 --> 00:34:22.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

548
00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:24.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He went up north for a bit
to be with his relatives.

549
00:34:24.937 --> 00:34:27.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to be with family
at times like this.

550
00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:30.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He'll be back soon. I'll vouch for that.

551
00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:33.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He'll be back.

553
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:58.513 --> 00:34:59.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Here's the ironing board.

556
00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:05.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. I'll have a couple of the boys
come pick it up. Sorry about that.

557
00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:09.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No apology necessary.
We're all learning as we go.

00:35:12.735 --> 00:35:14.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can see why I went easy on the fiancé.

560
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:18.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ugly end for someone you just proposed to.

561
00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:19.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] How long were they engaged?

562
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Couple months, I think.

563
00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:24.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could be he felt trapped.

564
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:26.874 --> 00:35:28.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remember what Wendy said?

566
00:35:29.252 --> 00:35:31.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A colleague of ours, a psychologist.

567
00:35:31.254 --> 00:35:34.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Events we process as good news
sometimes hit these killers the wrong way.

568
00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:36.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh. That's interesting.

569
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

570
00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:42.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A welder, Alvin Moran,
out taking his dog for a hike.

571
00:35:42.765 --> 00:35:44.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

572
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:48.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Alibi? He came to us.
Why's he need an alibi?

573
00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:51.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes the killer will
insinuate himself into the investigation.

574
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:53.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

575
00:35:53.609 --> 00:35:54.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Can we talk to him?

576
00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:57.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

577
00:36:10.626 --> 00:36:11.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me!

578
00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:14.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Moran?

579
00:36:16.924 --> 00:36:18.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Moran?

580
00:36:25.474 --> 00:36:27.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You remember me, Mr. Moran?

581
00:36:27.393 --> 00:36:30.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These men from the FBI
would like to talk to you. That all right?

582
00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:31.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great.

583
00:36:32.607 --> 00:36:35.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're told you found Beverly Jean's body.

584
00:36:35.318 --> 00:36:37.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How'd you happen to find yourself
at the dump?

585
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hiking. Wopsononock Mountain.

586
00:36:41.324 --> 00:36:42.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like to take the trail, clear my head.

587
00:36:43.075 --> 00:36:45.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get a break from the wife and kids?
-[Alvin] That's right.

588
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Get up there a few times a week.
Take the dog for a walk.

589
00:36:48.414 --> 00:36:50.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] Still not clear
how that puts you at the dump.

590
00:36:50.917 --> 00:36:53.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The path comes in pretty close.
-Does it?

591
00:36:53.794 --> 00:36:56.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You see any sign of a hiking trail
out by the dump, Bill?

592
00:36:56.923 --> 00:36:59.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The other side of the railroad tracks,
up the hill.

593
00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:01.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like a bunch of trees
from where you're standing.

594
00:37:02.345 --> 00:37:04.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if there's no clear view
from the dump to the trail...

595
00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you really FBI?

596
00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:08.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Am I under suspicion here?

597
00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:13.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

598
00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:19.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I come off the trail to take a piss,
no law against it.

599
00:37:19.528 --> 00:37:21.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There may be, actually,
but let's leave that for now.

600
00:37:22.031 --> 00:37:24.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You go to take a piss,
you see Beverly Jean's body...

601
00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought it was a store mannequin
or something.

602
00:37:27.828 --> 00:37:29.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wouldn't your dog
have gone straight for it?

603
00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:32.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Might have, but that's not what happened.
-What kind of dog?

604
00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:35.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Retriever.
-And he didn't sniff it out first?

605
00:37:35.711 --> 00:37:36.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That seems odd.

606
00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:39.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He's an old dog.
-Not too old for a hike.

607
00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:44.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I took care of my business, I collected
my dog, and I went to the police.

608
00:37:45.012 --> 00:37:47.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right away? Few hours later? Next day?

609
00:37:47.181 --> 00:37:49.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Couple hours later. Maybe that night.

610
00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:52.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was actually morning
when you came in, sir.

611
00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:56.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] Why'd you wait so long
to report the body, Mr. Moran?

612
00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:02.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're talking to the FBI, Mr. Moran.
If we want to find something out, we will.

613
00:38:05.908 --> 00:38:08.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was scared the cops
might want me for it, okay?

614
00:38:09.412 --> 00:38:12.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My wife talked me out of that.
I did my duty as a citizen.

615
00:38:12.373 --> 00:38:14.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You thought they'd want you for a murder?

616
00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:17.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I seen cops get desperate,
grab whoever they can get.

617
00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:18.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] But why you?

618
00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got a bit of a record, all right?

619
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:26.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It ain't much. I lit up a few fires
when I was a kid, got into a few fights.

620
00:38:26.762 --> 00:38:27.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I ain't proud of it.

621
00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:29.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Came here, met my wife.

622
00:38:30.933 --> 00:38:34.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Family man now.
-Before that, did you move around a lot?

623
00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:39.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alvin] Not a good way to live.
I feel settled now.

624
00:38:41.902 --> 00:38:43.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that your statement, Mr. Moran?

625
00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:50.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I come into town,
grab a beer now and then.

626
00:38:53.539 --> 00:38:55.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I seen Beverly Jean a few times.

627
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You saw Beverly Jean at a bar?

628
00:38:58.586 --> 00:38:59.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At The Kettle.

629
00:39:01.047 --> 00:39:03.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Finally got up the nerve.
-The nerve to do what?

630
00:39:04.592 --> 00:39:05.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To buy her a drink.

00:39:08.054 --> 00:39:10.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She wasn't interested, end of story.

632
00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:14.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I asked her more than once.

633
00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:18.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
More than once that night at the bar,
or on more than one occasion?

634
00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:21.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess you'd say
on more than one occasion.

635
00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:28.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He's too old and too married.
-[Holden] He was a drifter until recently.

636
00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:29.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beverly Jean rejected him.

637
00:39:29.825 --> 00:39:32.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's got a record.
He tried to help the police.

638
00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:36.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And his alibi?
Home watching TV with the wife?

639
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:40.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If a man like that took Beverly Jean,
he'd draw it out, make her suffer.

640
00:39:40.294 --> 00:39:42.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You saw the photos,
he must've tortured her for hours.

641
00:39:42.588 --> 00:39:45.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] Those wounds were inflicted
posthumously. Can't forget.

642
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:47.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You said that before.
What difference does that make?

643
00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:51.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you're married, it's a contract.

644
00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:53.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's children, a mortgage,

645
00:39:53.808 --> 00:39:56.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a house to keep up,
almost like a business.

646
00:39:57.269 --> 00:40:00.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Only you can't quit. She can't fire you.

647
00:40:00.314 --> 00:40:02.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stock goes up, stock goes down...

648
00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:03.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
doesn't matter, you're trapped.

649
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:07.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unless you want to bring on the lawyers
and open Pandora's box.

650
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Resentment builds on both sides.

651
00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:10.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A thousand tiny cuts.

652
00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:14.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If Alvin Moran had a married man's anger,

653
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he'd have tortured, then killed her.

654
00:40:17.164 --> 00:40:18.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No question in my mind.

655
00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:23.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe we should talk to his wife.
See if there's anything there.

656
00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:27.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, she's the whole alibi.

657
00:40:28.801 --> 00:40:30.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wouldn't mind checking it holds up.

658
00:40:31.053 --> 00:40:32.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[phone ringing]

659
00:40:35.558 --> 00:40:37.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mrs. Moran, thank you for coming in.

660
00:40:37.685 --> 00:40:40.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My name is Bill Tench.
This is my partner, Holden Ford.

661
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:42.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello.

662
00:40:44.817 --> 00:40:46.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't understand.
I can't call my husband?

663
00:40:46.819 --> 00:40:50.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Aren't I supposed to get my phone call?
-You're not under arrest, Mrs. Moran.

664
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These men are from the FBI.

665
00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:54.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They just want to ask you
a couple questions.

666
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you been following the investigation?

667
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can't look at that. Poor girl.

668
00:41:03.502 --> 00:41:05.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wouldn't hurt a fly.
-You knew her?

669
00:41:07.047 --> 00:41:08.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can we ask how you knew her?

670
00:41:09.884 --> 00:41:12.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Moran] She was almost our babysitter.
-Almost?

671
00:41:16.098 --> 00:41:16.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mrs. Moran?

672
00:41:19.059 --> 00:41:20.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We talked with her about it.

673
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:26.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When she left,
Alvin wouldn't shut up about the girl.

674
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:28.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Meaning?

675
00:41:29.445 --> 00:41:30.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know what I mean.

676
00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:32.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's best if we don't have to guess,
ma'am.

677
00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:39.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was young, and skinny, and...

678
00:41:40.414 --> 00:41:42.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Oh, such pretty blonde hair."

679
00:41:43.959 --> 00:41:45.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't need that in my house.

680
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not with two little kids in the picture.

681
00:41:49.381 --> 00:41:50.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do I look like?

682
00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:55.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Were you aware that your husband
made overtures to Beverly

683
00:41:55.304 --> 00:41:56.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
on several occasions?

684
00:41:56.722 --> 00:41:59.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Didn't I just say
he had a thing for the poor girl?

685
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:04.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Alvin does this.

686
00:42:05.147 --> 00:42:09.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like sportfishing.
He doesn't mean anything by it.

687
00:42:09.318 --> 00:42:11.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We were told he was home with you
watching television

688
00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:12.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the night Beverly disappeared.

689
00:42:16.408 --> 00:42:18.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think Alvin did this?

690
00:42:20.955 --> 00:42:23.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! No.

691
00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:28.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I'd love for him
to get a good scare,

692
00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:30.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
bothering a girl half his age,

693
00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:32.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but... no.

694
00:42:34.468 --> 00:42:35.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The idiot was with me.

695
00:42:36.428 --> 00:42:37.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole night?

696
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole night.

697
00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:47.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] Okay, her husband made a pass
at a younger woman. He's an idiot.

698
00:42:48.107 --> 00:42:49.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But so are a million other men.

699
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't see any of the anger
you've been talking about.

700
00:42:51.902 --> 00:42:53.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So lo and behold,
we're back to the fiancé.

701
00:42:53.988 --> 00:42:55.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Follow your own logic, Bill.

702
00:42:55.864 --> 00:42:58.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The anger makes no sense
in a young couple either.

703
00:42:58.492 --> 00:43:00.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This could be the first in a sequence.

704
00:43:00.327 --> 00:43:04.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nine times out of ten, it's the boyfriend,
the husband, somebody close.

705
00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:05.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nine times isn't every time, Bill.

706
00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:06.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen, uh...

707
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can't say how much
I appreciate all your help.

708
00:43:10.796 --> 00:43:13.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry if I got off a little shaky there
at the start.

709
00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:16.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna stick with Alvin,
if it's all the same, keep you posted.

710
00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:23.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carr]<i> So you're in the middle</i>
<i>of an ongoing investigation?</i>

711
00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:26.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A local detective asked for our help.
What else could we do?

712
00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:28.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tell them you have more important things
to do with your time.

713
00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:32.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've been consulting with local cops
for years. No reason to change that now.

714
00:43:32.526 --> 00:43:34.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My assumption is you're good at your job.

715
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:37.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which means you're gonna be more
focused on solving an actual crime

716
00:43:37.364 --> 00:43:38.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
than the theoretical work we're doing.

717
00:43:39.074 --> 00:43:41.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And that's bad?
-[Carr] It's not good or bad.

718
00:43:42.036 --> 00:43:44.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't end crime, no matter what we do.

719
00:43:44.496 --> 00:43:47.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But in the long run, I think that
our project could have a deeper impact

720
00:43:47.833 --> 00:43:49.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
than solving a single murder.

721
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can do both. It's not an issue.

722
00:43:54.089 --> 00:43:56.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What jumped out
when you were talking to Rissell?

723
00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:58.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He seems aware of the trap
of his childhood.

724
00:43:58.177 --> 00:44:00.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How things might be different
if he was allowed to stay with his dad.

725
00:44:01.055 --> 00:44:02.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kemper said something similar.

726
00:44:02.222 --> 00:44:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're both playing the victim,
looking for sympathy.

727
00:44:04.683 --> 00:44:06.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] I think it's more complicated.

728
00:44:06.393 --> 00:44:09.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you're both right.
I mean, it's self-pity, absolutely.

729
00:44:09.855 --> 00:44:12.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the psychopath understands
how that plays to his audience.

730
00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:14.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Exactly.
-But the complicated part

731
00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:17.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that they actually believe it.
They have to.

732
00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:20.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, if they admitted
that they rape and murder for pleasure,

733
00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:21.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it would destroy them.

734
00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:23.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a tension.

735
00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:26.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They need to be seen
to have power over someone,

736
00:44:26.622 --> 00:44:29.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and yet circumstance demands
that they erase the only witness,

737
00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:32.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which means they have to do
the whole thing over again.

738
00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:33.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It must be hell.

739
00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:36.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the self-pity angle works.
You have sympathy for both of them.

740
00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:38.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, of course.
How else could I do my job?

741
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do Kemper and Rissell
have other common traits?

742
00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:44.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That what you're doing with these cards,
figuring out similarities?

743
00:44:45.057 --> 00:44:47.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And differences.
I've been going through their files.

744
00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:51.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to frame an overall taxonomy,
except I don't know where to start.

745
00:44:51.438 --> 00:44:52.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] The crime scene.

746
00:44:52.606 --> 00:44:55.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kemper's like a general,
planning his campaigns.

747
00:44:55.234 --> 00:44:57.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But Rissell--
-Didn't intend to kill his first victim.

748
00:44:57.736 --> 00:45:00.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All of his victims seem spontaneous.
He just walks away when he's done.

749
00:45:00.697 --> 00:45:02.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kemper took photographs,
and dissected the victims,

750
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:04.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and was very good at hiding the remains.

751
00:45:04.993 --> 00:45:07.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So could we say "systematic"
and "anti-systematic"?

752
00:45:07.913 --> 00:45:09.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Maybe something a little less...

753
00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:11.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Something even a beat cop
could understand straight away.

754
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right.
Like "organized" and "disorganized."

755
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Let's try it.

756
00:45:16.588 --> 00:45:17.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What goes where?

757
00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:19.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well...

758
00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:24.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"High intelligence"
would go under "organized."

759
00:45:24.596 --> 00:45:27.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Low intelligence": "disorganized."

760
00:45:30.644 --> 00:45:32.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What do you think?
-Definitely.

761
00:45:32.646 --> 00:45:36.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The class is great, but he's obsessed
with the meaning of shit.

762
00:45:36.108 --> 00:45:37.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does shit have meaning?

763
00:45:37.192 --> 00:45:38.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All shit has meaning, man.

764
00:45:40.195 --> 00:45:41.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that her?

765
00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:43.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[scoffs]

766
00:45:44.324 --> 00:45:46.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. Wendy's more...

767
00:45:47.786 --> 00:45:48.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
not that.

768
00:45:48.704 --> 00:45:50.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at you.

769
00:45:50.205 --> 00:45:53.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dr. Wendy has you all nervous.
Should I be jealous?

770
00:45:53.959 --> 00:45:56.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would I have invited her to go out with us
if I was interested in her?

771
00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've seen men do stranger things.

772
00:45:59.548 --> 00:46:01.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So she's married.
-How does that follow?

773
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:04.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're not interested,
she must be married.

774
00:46:05.053 --> 00:46:09.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For a man who picks up strange women
in bars, you have your scruples.

775
00:46:10.225 --> 00:46:11.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

776
00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:15.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think she is married.

777
00:46:16.064 --> 00:46:17.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's her.

778
00:46:19.026 --> 00:46:21.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] No.

779
00:46:22.654 --> 00:46:24.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you plan on getting married?

780
00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:26.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Having kids, the whole thing?

781
00:46:27.367 --> 00:46:29.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you proposing, Holden Ford?

782
00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:30.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just curious.

783
00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:35.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Your parents have a good marriage?
-I have no idea.

784
00:46:35.667 --> 00:46:38.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Where's this coming from?
-The study.

785
00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:40.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're talking a lot about parents.

786
00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:42.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Harsh mothers, absent fathers.

787
00:46:42.591 --> 00:46:44.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All fathers are absent fathers.

788
00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's definitely her.

789
00:46:49.932 --> 00:46:51.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-[laughs]

790
00:46:51.767 --> 00:46:52.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello.

791
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:54.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi.

792
00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:57.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wendy Carr.
-Deborah Mitford.

793
00:46:57.898 --> 00:46:59.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a pleasure.

794
00:46:59.107 --> 00:47:02.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you so much for the invitation.
It was unexpected, but appreciated.

795
00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:05.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, for a fed, he's not so bad
at having a good time.

796
00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:07.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you in law enforcement also?

797
00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:09.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I'm doing postgrad, actually.

798
00:47:09.743 --> 00:47:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sociology at UVA.
-What's your concentration?

799
00:47:12.204 --> 00:47:14.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Debbie] Social deviance.
-So... Durkheim?

800
00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:16.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-Oh, God.

801
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:18.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I didn't know who Durkheim was...

802
00:47:19.044 --> 00:47:21.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Or Goring, or Blumer.
-It's fine.

803
00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:25.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not intimidated being around women
who are smarter than me.

804
00:47:25.759 --> 00:47:28.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Men often say that,
but they rarely mean it.

805
00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:29.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Debbie] Holden means it.

806
00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:32.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He has a lot of flaws,
but surprisingly, that's not one of them.

807
00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:37.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm-- Excuse me.
-Yes.

808
00:47:38.438 --> 00:47:41.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could I get a Manhattan?
And will you have another round?

809
00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, thank you.
-Yeah.

810
00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:45.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carr] So he called you directly?

811
00:47:46.071 --> 00:47:49.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, Andrea called.
Said he wanted to meet with us.

812
00:47:49.449 --> 00:47:51.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any idea what this is about?

813
00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:54.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. Usually, it's about finding clarity.

814
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he asked for me specifically?

815
00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:57.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All three of us.

816
00:48:19.146 --> 00:48:20.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Shepard] Come in.

817
00:48:22.316 --> 00:48:26.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dr. Carr, Unit Chief Shepard.
Nice to meet you finally.

818
00:48:26.278 --> 00:48:27.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carr] You as well.

819
00:48:27.863 --> 00:48:30.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Shepard] Sit, please. All of you.

820
00:48:32.242 --> 00:48:35.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, how's everything? Progressing?

821
00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:38.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, yes, thank you.

822
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:40.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Fine, thanks.
-Slowly, but yes.

823
00:48:40.667 --> 00:48:41.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I help with anything?

824
00:48:45.464 --> 00:48:47.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is there anything I need to know?

825
00:48:49.968 --> 00:48:52.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sir, if this is about the car--
-Nobody cares about the car.

826
00:48:52.638 --> 00:48:55.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was insured and I assume driven
by your protégé.

827
00:48:56.016 --> 00:48:58.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not important who was driving.
-[Shepard] I agree.

828
00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:01.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dr. Carr, I'm aware of your consulting
with Bill over the years

829
00:49:02.022 --> 00:49:05.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and your help framing certain
psychological concepts with the BSU.

830
00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:08.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, yes, a handful of times.
Special Agent Tench was--

831
00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:11.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I assume that meant you understood
how things were done here at Quantico.

832
00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:14.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I assumed the same for your cohorts.

833
00:49:15.661 --> 00:49:18.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You might think it is my job
to impede your progress

834
00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:22.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with my insistence on timelines
and established protocols.

835
00:49:22.167 --> 00:49:24.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, sir. Not at all.
-That is not my job.

836
00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:27.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My job is to provide guidance
and quite a bit of protection.

837
00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:29.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't understand.
-Clearly.

838
00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:34.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have stepped
outside the shade of my umbrella

839
00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:36.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you are now exposed
to direct sunlight.

840
00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:39.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I applied for grant money
from several sources

841
00:49:39.768 --> 00:49:41.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:58.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:50:24.438 --> 00:50:25.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:50:25.731 --> 00:50:29.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:38.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
