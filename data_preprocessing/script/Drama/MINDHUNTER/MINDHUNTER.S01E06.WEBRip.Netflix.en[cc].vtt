-Of course.

I realized I don't know much
about your life in Boston,

I've been following your work,
and I have to say I'm rather impressed.

13
00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, thank you. I appreciate that.

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:44.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not the only one. There's a growing
interest in your project around here.

So I was wondering, Agents Tench
and Ford can't run this all by themselves,

16
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

not to take full advantage of that.

I'd rather you didn't tell Tench or Ford
about this until you make your decision.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have two questions for you, Benjamin.
First one...

29
00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

30
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What the fuck were you crying about
last time we saw you?

31
00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And secondly, and this one
is a big question,

32
00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I want you to listen very carefully.

33
00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:47.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you listening to me? Benji?

34
00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why? Why would you do that
to Beverly Jean?

35
00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fractured jaw. Two black eyes.

36
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:57.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

37
00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fourteen stab wounds in the torso
with a kitchen knife.

38
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Blow to the head, blunt force trauma.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

40
00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to know this.

41
00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why would you do that
to your girlfriend, man?

42
00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:13.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't.

43
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you're telling us it was Frank.

44
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He called us. He was freaked out.
I went over.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And then?
-I walked into the living room

46
00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and Beverly Jean was knocked out
on the floor, tied up.

47
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did he tell you what happened?

48
00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

49
00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:38.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think he tried to get into her panties,
she wouldn't let him, he knocked her out.

50
00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's why he called you?
-He calls me when he's in trouble.

51
00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Holden] She was alive at this point?
-Yes.

52
00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So why'd you kill her?
-Don't answer that.

53
00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't.

54
00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:57.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why would a man, any man,
do that to a woman's breasts?

55
00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:01.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And who would take a hunting knife
to a woman's reproductive organs?

56
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:03.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

57
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"All right"?
There's nothing right about it.

58
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's enough.
Now my client's also a victim here.

61
00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[man] You don't have to answer that.
-[Holden] So you did cut her hair?

62
00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:17.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

got to a point

63
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:20.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where she was interested
in seeing other guys.

64
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She'd just had her hair done, right?
-Let me ask you one more thing.

65
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How does stabbing somebody
in the asshole make you feel better?

66
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

79
00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's always saying he liked her hair.

80
00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

81
00:06:04.822 --> 00:06:09.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thing is, he didn't care about her hair
at all. He just used it to rile me.

82
00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

If Benjamin killed her,
you should just tell us.

I think he's very lucky to have you.

209
00:13:14.251 --> 00:13:15.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

210
00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:17.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you tell?

211
00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:23.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes I get up at night
and watch him sleeping.

212
00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:28.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I can't help but wonder who he was...

213
00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:31.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
before we got him.

214
00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did he see or hear?

215
00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did anyone hold him when he cried?

216
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:01.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's beautiful.

217
00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:08.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just wish I knew what went on
inside that little head of his.

218
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench]<i> It's always the mother.</i>

219
00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They all have a crazy, angry mother.

220
00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Or an absent father.

221
00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:18.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Benjamin only changed
after his father took off.

222
00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:22.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Maybe has nothing to do with the mother.
-Aren't all fathers absent in some way?

223
00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:24.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know my old man was never around.

224
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Imagine how different
Benjamin and Rose's lives might have been

225
00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:30.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-if their father never left.
-Not sure it would've changed much.

226
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Your father really didn't speak to you?
-No.

227
00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:38.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you speak with Brian.

228
00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want one more?

00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Ocasek]<i> Yeah.</i>

231
00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:51.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. Has he seen all our notes
on the evidence?

232
00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:53.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>-Yeah, I showed him everything.</i>
-[Tench] And?

233
00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He is going to try Benjamin first.</i>

234
00:14:55.352 --> 00:14:57.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait a minute. Say that again.

235
00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:59.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>He's only gonna try Benjamin,</i>

236
00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:01.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Tench] Mark, that's not right.
-Is that Ocasek?

237
00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:03.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>He's confident</i>

238
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, there's something
he doesn't understand.

239
00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Well, I tried to explain</i>
<i>exactly like you said,</i>

240
00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:09.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>but he wasn't interested in talking.</i>

241
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay, look, I'll call you back.
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>

242
00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:12.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shit, it's not your fault, Mark.

243
00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:15.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let me talk to some folks here
and get back to you.

244
00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:16.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>-Okay.</i>
-What's happening?

245
00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:18.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The DA is going after Benjamin first,

246
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which means
he'll end up offering a plea deal

247
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for Frank's and Rose's testimony.

248
00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:25.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did Ocasek tell him
about Frank's history of violence?

249
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:26.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] I'm sure he did.

250
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Clearly, he's the most dangerous
of the three.

251
00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:31.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] We need to go talk to the DA,
help him understand.

252
00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:33.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have a deposition this afternoon.

253
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I can't do anything till tomorrow.
-I'll go.

254
00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:38.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You better go with him.

255
00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:48.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carr]<i> It is acutely obvious</i>
<i>that, in this instance,</i>

256
00:15:48.238 --> 00:15:50.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the anger was triggered by stressors

257
00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:53.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that were focused on his fiancé
in particular.

258
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Stressors"?

259
00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:57.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dramatic life events.
Things that pushed both their buttons.

260
00:15:57.539 --> 00:16:00.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frank Janderman was happily married
with a new baby on the way.

261
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carr] But Frank didn't want
to be a father. He hated that.

262
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that a motive?
-No. It's what we call a stressor.

263
00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:08.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you think Frank did it?

264
00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carr] Benjamin wouldn't have been able to
on his own.

265
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're saying Benjamin was provoked
by Frank?

266
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pushed. Yes.

267
00:16:14.598 --> 00:16:17.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frank saw his chance
and raped Beverly Jean.

268
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Situationally motivated sexual assaults--
-Wait.

269
00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:22.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-"Situationally"?
-As opposed to preferential, yes.

270
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, look it. Here's my question.

271
00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:27.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who killed her?

272
00:16:27.611 --> 00:16:29.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All three of them are responsible
for her death.

273
00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:32.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So they all mutilated the body?
-[Carr] No, that was Benjamin.

274
00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:35.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frank and Benjamin left her body
at the dump, wrapped up.

275
00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:38.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Benjamin came back a few days later.
He couldn't let go.

276
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Remember, he was under a lot of stress.
He took the knife to her--

277
00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:44.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let me stop you there, because...
here's the problem.

278
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do I prove all this?

279
00:16:46.213 --> 00:16:49.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just here to provide you
with intelligent, accurate analysis.

280
00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:52.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If a jury can't understand your analysis,
then it's no use to anybody, is it?

281
00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:56.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I agree. But it isn't my job
to make the jury understand anything.

282
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's your job.

283
00:16:57.391 --> 00:16:59.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we have all placed our trust in you.

284
00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:07.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carr] How do we translate this
so you can use it?

285
00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:11.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What you're saying is that both Benjamin
and Frank killed her, right?

286
00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:12.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carr] It's complicated, I know.

287
00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:16.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Benjamin knocked her out
because he felt like he was rejected,

288
00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:17.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is a stressor.

289
00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:19.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He tied her up
and called his brother-in-law Frank

290
00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:21.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because he didn't know what to do.

291
00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:25.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So Frank comes over and takes advantage
of the situation and rapes her.

292
00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:29.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Benjamin doesn't stop him
because he wants to see her humiliated.

293
00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:31.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now Frank knows that he's in trouble,

294
00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:33.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so he starts telling Benjamin
what a slut she is.

295
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that is a big problem for Benjamin.

296
00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:38.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So they kill her.

297
00:17:38.098 --> 00:17:40.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then they call Rose,
have her come and help clean up.

298
00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:44.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And she sees the poor girl in the bathtub
and realizes that she's still alive.

299
00:17:45.355 --> 00:17:46.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So they stab her again.

300
00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:49.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then they move the body to the dump.

301
00:17:52.613 --> 00:17:53.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

302
00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:56.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

303
00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That went well.
-You think?

304
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure, I mean...
what don't you think he grasped?

305
00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:08.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I mean, Holden,
you know these people. I don't.

306
00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:11.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that he seemed very intent
on blaming Benjamin,

307
00:18:11.298 --> 00:18:13.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I'm not quite sure
I got him over that.

308
00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:17.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, certainly at the end,
he seemed very attentive.

309
00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:20.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought you laid it out clearly
and concisely for him

310
00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:22.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that it was all three.

311
00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:24.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, if you're right,

00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:41.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:47.425 --> 00:23:49.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not backstage

408
00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:29.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You offered him a plea bargain?

409
00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:32.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He just pled guilty

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:40.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:42.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:42.856 --> 00:24:44.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know that's not true.

415
00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:47.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You had an expert in psychopathy

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that Frank motivated Benjamin
to commit murder and--

418
00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:54.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She said he pushed his buttons.

419
00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:56.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[DA] And Benjamin came back
and disfigured the body.

420
00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:57.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, guess what?

421
00:24:58.079 --> 00:24:59.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frank confirmed all that.

422
00:24:59.414 --> 00:25:03.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Dr. Carr got one thing wrong.
Frank didn't rape her. Benjamin did.

423
00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:05.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The victim was already dead
when Frank got there.

424
00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:08.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hold on.
-She said Benjamin was jealous,

425
00:25:08.089 --> 00:25:10.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
sexually frustrated, humiliated.

426
00:25:10.133 --> 00:25:11.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a motive.

427
00:25:11.092 --> 00:25:12.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You got it all wrong.
-I have the report here.

428
00:25:13.053 --> 00:25:15.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've read the report.
It points in the opposite direction.

429
00:25:15.805 --> 00:25:18.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Benjamin was impotent
because of the stressors.

430
00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:22.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was frustrated and humiliated. It was
impossible for him to rape the victim.

431
00:25:22.103 --> 00:25:24.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I understand the righteousness
of your cause,

432
00:25:24.648 --> 00:25:27.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but this is an exceptionally difficult
and disturbing case.

433
00:25:27.734 --> 00:25:31.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's very little forensic evidence.
Almost all the evidence is circumstantial.

434
00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You classify our evidence
as circumstantial?

435
00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:35.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

436
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frank told us where to find
the victim's breasts.

437
00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:40.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Benjamin had kept them.
-[Holden] So?

438
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:43.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I got a guy who's jealous,
sexually frustrated,

439
00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:46.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we find the victim's breasts
buried in his backyard.

440
00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:49.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then I got a guy who's willing to tell us
what happened.

441
00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:51.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a huge difference
between killing a woman

442
00:25:51.508 --> 00:25:53.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and mutilating her body after she is dead.

443
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A plea bargain is the only antidote
against a failed prosecution.

444
00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] You're letting Frank off.

445
00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:01.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He shouldn't just go
to a mental institution for five years.

446
00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:04.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He should be put away for life.
-[DA] Five to 20 years.

447
00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:07.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the defense is arguing
the state had a duty of care

448
00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the first time Frank was in the hospital.

449
00:26:09.025 --> 00:26:11.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The onus is on the state
to make him better.

450
00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:12.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's never going to get better.

451
00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:15.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have to make a phone call.

452
00:26:36.469 --> 00:26:38.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench]<i> He's letting the wrong guy off</i>
<i>with a lighter sentence.</i>

453
00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:41.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When Wendy explained it to him,
he seemed to understand.

454
00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:45.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think he wasn't sure
he could convince a jury.

455
00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:48.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This way it's airtight.
-He didn't try.

456
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:54.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No hard feelings, okay?

457
00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:57.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know the outcome
wasn't what you wanted.

458
00:26:57.449 --> 00:27:00.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All three behind bars,
and Benjamin'll fry for what he did.

459
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:04.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not all bad.
You know what we're up against.

460
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have to consider the attention span
of a prospective jury pool.

461
00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:10.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Need to keep them in mind.

462
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our objective is the lowest cost
for the highest quality of justice.

463
00:27:14.215 --> 00:27:15.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know this is bullshit.

464
00:27:17.218 --> 00:27:18.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me get you a steak sandwich.

465
00:27:18.636 --> 00:27:20.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Outside of KC,
it's the best I've come across.

466
00:27:20.638 --> 00:27:22.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, thanks.
-I've lost my appetite.

467
00:27:22.932 --> 00:27:24.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need to hit the road.

468
00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:27.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Thank you for everything.

469
00:27:39.407 --> 00:27:41.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What difference does any of this make

470
00:27:41.117 --> 00:27:43.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if we can't communicate it
to the people who matter?

471
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

472
00:28:04.557 --> 00:28:06.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carr]<i> It's all about process now.</i>

473
00:28:06.142 --> 00:28:10.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Refining our methodology, making sure
we're airtight and idiot-proof.

474
00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:11.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we need more subjects.

475
00:28:11.314 --> 00:28:13.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ones just like Kemper, please.
-Those were the days.

476
00:28:14.567 --> 00:28:17.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, you're going to see people
present with similar pathologies,

477
00:28:17.445 --> 00:28:19.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the way a person kills

478
00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:22.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is as individual and distinct
as the way they have sex.

479
00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:23.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And just as complicated.

480
00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:27.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jerome Brudos. King of souvenirs.

481
00:28:27.455 --> 00:28:29.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Brudos? The shoe guy?
-[Holden] Who's he?

482
00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:33.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Six, seven years ago.
Sometimes he wore women's dresses.

483
00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:35.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carr] He amputated the breasts
of his first and third victims.

484
00:28:36.089 --> 00:28:39.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just like Benjamin.
-It's themed. Wendy loves a pattern.

485
00:28:39.092 --> 00:28:41.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all about finding patterns.

486
00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:43.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Except he went a little further
than Benjamin.

487
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:46.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He plaster cast the breasts
and made them into bronze paperweights.

488
00:28:46.516 --> 00:28:47.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's creative.

489
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carr] His second victim, he amputated
a foot which he stored in his freezer.

490
00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:52.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He had a collection
of hundreds of women's shoes

491
00:28:52.856 --> 00:28:54.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which he used for masturbation.

492
00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:57.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think we can learn a lot from this guy.
-I'm in.

493
00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:00.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This time we use the questionnaire.

494
00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:03.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did we settle on that?

495
00:29:03.783 --> 00:29:06.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have to be able to distinguish
the fractal similarities and differences

496
00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:08.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so that we can codify it clearly.

497
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Otherwise, we're just wasting our time.

498
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure, but sometimes
you got to go with your gut.

499
00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:15.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And when you first walk in,
you can trust your instinct.

500
00:29:15.545 --> 00:29:17.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But once you get your subject talking,

501
00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:20.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we need the protocols
so we can build a consistent data set.

502
00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:23.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Makes sense.
-What else do we know about Brudos?

503
00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:26.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carr] As a teenager, he started grabbing
lingerie from clotheslines.

504
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:27.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Soon he was breaking into homes,

505
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
stealing women's underwear,
shoes, and dresses.

506
00:29:30.393 --> 00:29:33.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then eventually, he escalated
to kidnapping and murder.

507
00:29:33.396 --> 00:29:35.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But he was married with two children
by then.

508
00:29:35.398 --> 00:29:37.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This file is as thick as an encyclopedia.

509
00:29:37.734 --> 00:29:40.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think we're gonna get something
that isn't in here?

510
00:29:40.236 --> 00:29:41.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely.

511
00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:44.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In all that paperwork,
there's not a single word

512
00:29:44.157 --> 00:29:45.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that illuminates
what he was thinking or feeling,

513
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:48.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
before, during, or after the crimes.

514
00:29:48.244 --> 00:29:50.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's nothing
on his operation principles, his logic.

515
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Logic?
-[Carr] His internal logic, yes.

516
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:55.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which, hopefully, one day
we'll be able to decipher.

517
00:29:57.128 --> 00:29:59.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, we all agreed. Brudos is next.

518
00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:00.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

519
00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you mind if I take that room?

520
00:30:04.219 --> 00:30:06.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-For what?
-For my office.
