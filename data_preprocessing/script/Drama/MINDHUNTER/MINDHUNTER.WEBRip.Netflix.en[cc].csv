00:00:25.734,00:00:27.152,"Agent Ford, FBI."
00:00:30.280,00:00:31.239,"Here, sir."
00:00:34.701,00:00:37.871,"If you harm anyone, it will not end well for you!"
00:00:37.954,00:00:39.456,Special Agent Holden Ford.
00:00:41.166,00:00:42.876,-Ninkovich. -Is he talking?
00:00:42.959,00:00:44.294,Not making sense. Been briefed?
00:00:44.377,00:00:46.254,On the way over. Five people still in there?
00:00:46.337,00:00:49.090,"A security guard, the secretary, three guys from the line."
00:00:56.806,00:00:59.476,"Put the gun down, step away from Ms. Curtwell."
00:01:04.606,00:01:05.482,You gonna shoot me?
00:01:05.982,00:01:11.279,"If you do not abide by our terms, and soon-- You can't see me!"
00:01:11.362,00:01:14.574,"I'm warning you, our patience is wearing thin."
00:01:14.657,00:01:17.660,How can you shoot what you can't see?
00:01:17.744,00:01:18.745,Mr. Miller!
00:01:20.997,00:01:22.332,"Hey, Cody."
00:01:23.666,00:01:26.503,My name is Holden. I'd like to help you.
00:01:27.045,00:01:29.672,-Tell me what's going on. -I gotta talk to my wife.
00:01:31.508,00:01:32.759,I understand.
00:01:32.842,00:01:35.553,"For the moment, is there anything else we can get you?"
00:01:35.637,00:01:37.639,Get these fucking people away.
00:01:37.722,00:01:38.640,Okay.
00:01:46.898,00:01:52.779,"If I can get them to back off, will you... relax with Ms. Curtwell?"
00:01:53.696,00:01:56.324,Give us some time to reach your wife.
00:02:00.411,00:02:01.454,Thank you.
00:02:05.959,00:02:08.503,Keep the snipers. Back out the perimeter.
00:02:08.586,00:02:10.505,"If he starts firing, we'll have to storm the place."
00:02:10.588,00:02:12.674,They're making me nervous. Imagine what they're doing to him.
00:02:12.757,00:02:15.218,He has no criminal history. He's clearly having an episode.
00:02:15.301,00:02:17.637,We need to keep him calm and wear him down.
00:02:18.054,00:02:19.556,Get rid of those reporters.
00:02:22.851,00:02:24.561,"All right, guys. Back it up!"
00:02:29.858,00:02:30.859,How am I doing?
00:02:41.119,00:02:42.871,"Yes, I can see you!"
00:02:47.876,00:02:49.460,I can see that you're cold.
00:02:59.429,00:03:01.264,Is there a phone? Can we get him on the line?
00:03:01.347,00:03:04.309,"-He's got it off the hook. -That was his demand, talk to his wife?"
00:03:04.392,00:03:06.352,Took all day to find her. She's on her way.
00:03:06.436,00:03:08.688,-You're not bringing her. -I want her to calm him.
00:03:08.771,00:03:10.440,Her presence might have the opposite effect.
00:03:14.193,00:03:16.321,"Hi, Mrs. Miller? Don't get out."
00:03:16.404,00:03:19.866,I'm Holden Ford from the FBI. Do you understand the situation?
00:03:19.949,00:03:23.369,-Cody's got some people in there? -What happened this morning?
00:03:23.453,00:03:24.412,I don't know.
00:03:24.954,00:03:27.999,"I tried to get him sectioned on Sunday, but I haven't seen him since."
00:03:28.082,00:03:31.377,"They told me he stole a shotgun, robbed a liquor store?"
00:03:31.461,00:03:32.754,Was he delusional? Violent?
00:03:32.837,00:03:34.756,He's not violent.
00:03:34.839,00:03:37.884,He's been saying that he's invisible for a while now.
00:03:37.967,00:03:40.011,Truly invisible. He's been seeing a doctor.
00:03:40.094,00:03:41.262,Did the doctor diagnose him?
00:03:41.888,00:03:43.556,Cody wouldn't tell me.
00:03:43.640,00:03:46.100,"He's taking medication, but he might've stopped."
00:03:46.184,00:03:48.478,-What kind of medication? -I'm not sure.
00:03:49.479,00:03:50.438,Here's his doctor.
00:03:50.521,00:03:52.273,You tried to get him sectioned?
00:03:52.357,00:03:55.526,"He kept talking to people that weren't there, saying they could see him."
00:03:56.402,00:03:59.030,I told him I was gonna leave him if he didn't go to the hospital.
00:04:02.492,00:04:04.827,-I feel awful. -This is not your fault.
00:04:05.286,00:04:06.704,Has he hurt anyone?
00:04:06.788,00:04:09.374,Not that we know about. I'm sending you along for now.
00:04:14.212,00:04:15.755,Have someone call his doctor.
00:04:15.838,00:04:17.799,Get his wife to tell him she won't leave him.
00:04:17.882,00:04:20.969,We need more information. Let's see if we can get him on the line.
00:04:22.845,00:04:24.097,Cody!
00:04:24.180,00:04:26.182,Everything okay in there?
00:04:29.143,00:04:31.104,I'd really like to know what's going on in there.
00:04:31.187,00:04:33.064,"I promise you, we can work this out."
00:04:40.905,00:04:42.031,Where's my wife?
00:04:48.621,00:04:51.249,She is very worried about you.
00:04:55.253,00:04:58.214,-Maybe you could talk to her on the phone. -No!
00:05:00.049,00:05:01.634,She has to be here.
00:05:15.231,00:05:16.774,What do you want to say to her?
00:05:17.775,00:05:18.985,Why would I tell you?
00:05:22.238,00:05:23.740,Maybe I can help.
00:05:25.658,00:05:26.743,I don't think so.
00:09:28.317,00:09:29.819,-Thank you. -You're welcome.
00:09:40.830,00:09:45.751,You followed procedure. You did your job. You did everything by the book.
00:09:45.835,00:09:48.588,He took hostages. He knew there'd be consequences.
00:09:48.671,00:09:50.673,-He thought he was invisible. -You're not his shrink.
00:09:50.756,00:09:53.926,You're not responsible for diagnosing him. That's not your remit.
00:09:54.885,00:09:58.055,"These things happen in real time, and we are the last responders."
00:09:58.139,00:10:01.684,"If an operation's gonna go south, this is not the worst outcome."
00:10:01.767,00:10:03.436,Stay focused on what we do.
00:10:03.519,00:10:10.484,"If I did everything by the book, it begs the question-- This place is pretty much the benchmark for excellence in law enforcement."
00:10:11.694,00:10:14.572,"In the rest of the world, hostage negotiation's on its way out."
00:10:14.655,00:10:17.617,You think the Israelis bothered to negotiate at Entebbe last year?
00:10:19.869,00:10:24.457,You didn't lose one hostage or bystander. That's how we measure success.
00:10:26.459,00:10:29.086,And your courses are a big hit in the summer.
00:10:29.170,00:10:31.255,I actually think you should be teaching more.
00:10:31.339,00:10:33.466,-You're putting me out to pasture. -No.
00:10:33.549,00:10:35.551,I'm putting you to work where it really counts.
00:10:35.635,00:10:37.011,Despite what happened.
00:10:37.094,00:10:39.347,"Because of what happened, Holden."
00:10:39.847,00:10:40.890,It seasoned you.
00:10:45.102,00:10:46.103,"Thank you, sir..."
00:10:47.104,00:10:48.105,but I'd rather not.
00:10:48.189,00:10:49.774,"Well, this is awkward."
00:10:52.485,00:10:54.695,I'd like you to sleep on it over the weekend...
00:10:56.322,00:10:58.491,because you start full-time on Monday.
00:11:06.791,00:11:11.003,This is how we find ourselves completely out of control.
00:11:12.213,00:11:15.716,The fugitive has already killed a police officer that morning in Austin.
00:11:17.134,00:11:25.601,"He's taken two nine-millimeter rounds in the ass, grabbed a ten-year-old boy as a hostage, and he's holed up in a suburban neighborhood crawling with women and small children."
00:11:26.769,00:11:31.065,Now we must focus on one thing: de-escalation.
00:11:31.649,00:11:38.739,"San Antonio's chief of police arrives and starts using a bullhorn, which more than effectively intimidates our hostage-taker."
00:11:40.199,00:11:45.454,"Coming at anyone with an attitude of I'm right, you're wrong assumes that they're of rational mind."
00:11:47.623,00:11:50.376,We must establish communication.
00:11:51.752,00:11:54.880,Non-threatening communication.
00:11:55.756,00:12:00.261,"Ascertain demands, concede nothing, reject nothing, just listen."
00:12:01.804,00:12:03.389,Listen to what he has to say.
00:12:05.391,00:12:08.227,Try understanding him instead of trying to dominate him.
00:12:09.228,00:12:10.729,Look for common ground.
00:12:10.813,00:12:12.815,Find commonality.
00:12:13.357,00:12:17.153,"And if it feels like you're buying time, well... that's because you are."
00:12:17.695,00:12:20.739,But it's the key to making any perp feel heard.
00:12:24.952,00:12:27.329,That is the hostage negotiator win-win.
00:12:29.290,00:12:34.253,And I'm in my office on Friday for anyone who has questions about the psychological strategies exam.
00:12:45.890,00:12:48.517,"Seemingly random, serendipitous."
00:12:48.601,00:12:50.269,"Each one, extremely violent."
00:12:50.352,00:12:52.980,No explanation. No apparent reason.
00:12:53.063,00:12:58.360,"They weren't sexually assaulted, there was no attempt to relieve them of valuables, they didn't know their assailant."
00:12:58.903,00:13:05.493,Robert Violante and Stacy Moskowitz were making out in their car when David Berkowitz walked up and shot them both point-blank.
00:13:06.368,00:13:10.748,"Berkowitz killed six people over two summers, wounding seven more. Why?"
00:13:11.999,00:13:14.376,Because a dog told him to do it.
00:13:15.753,00:13:16.670,Now...
00:13:18.506,00:13:22.259,"we can say that the guy's crazy, or that he's pretending that he's crazy."
00:13:22.676,00:13:27.306,"But if we're looking for a motive we can understand, we suddenly find there is none."
00:13:27.890,00:13:29.099,It's a void.
00:13:29.183,00:13:30.518,It's a black hole.
00:13:36.232,00:13:43.989,"Forty years ago, your FBI was founded hunting down John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly."
00:13:44.073,00:13:49.078,"Criminals who thumbed their noses at society, but were basically in it for personal gain."
00:13:50.037,00:13:53.999,"Now, we have extreme violence between strangers."
00:13:54.959,00:13:56.502,Where do we go...
00:13:57.670,00:14:00.005,when motive becomes elusive?
00:14:09.515,00:14:11.600,"Excuse me, Professor Rathman?"
00:14:13.852,00:14:16.272,"Holden Ford, Hostage Negotiation."
00:14:16.355,00:14:17.565,Peter. Hi.
00:14:17.648,00:14:21.277,I listened in on your class earlier. What you were saying about crime today...
00:14:22.152,00:14:23.863,"I don't know, it really resonates."
00:14:23.946,00:14:26.031,-Gets attention. -Were you teaching this before Berkowitz?
00:14:26.115,00:14:28.701,A version of it. The headlines kind of fell into my lap.
00:14:28.784,00:14:29.869,What got you started?
00:14:30.202,00:14:32.621,"Starkweather. Whitman. Manson, of course."
00:14:32.705,00:14:35.249,But Son of Sam kind of epitomizes now.
00:14:35.332,00:14:39.420,It's as if... we don't know anymore what moves people to kill one another.
00:14:39.503,00:14:45.092,"Used to be you find a victim with 50 stab wounds, you look for the jilted lover, the ex-business partner."
00:14:45.342,00:14:49.138,Now... it could be a random run-in with a disgruntled mailman.
00:14:49.221,00:14:52.558,"It's a different era. No more Just the facts, ma'am."
00:14:52.641,00:14:54.810,That's television. And reruns.
00:14:55.394,00:14:57.479,-Crime has changed. -Right.
00:14:58.898,00:15:00.733,Do you... want to grab a beer?
00:15:02.192,00:15:03.193,"Yeah, okay."
00:15:06.155,00:15:08.866,that have occurred in the past decade and a half.
00:15:08.949,00:15:10.492,A president assassinated.
00:15:10.576,00:15:13.245,Fighting an unpopular war that we didn't win.
00:15:13.329,00:15:15.748,National Guard killing four college students.
00:15:15.831,00:15:18.292,-You can hardly wrap your mind around it. -Watergate.
00:15:18.375,00:15:21.921,Our democracy is vanishing into what?
00:15:22.004,00:15:23.672,Is that what all this is about?
00:15:23.923,00:15:25.925,Just a response to turmoil?
00:15:26.008,00:15:29.094,"The government used to be, symbolically, a parental institution."
00:15:29.178,00:15:31.639,Now? It's a free-for-all.
00:15:31.722,00:15:35.184,"The world barely makes any sense, so it follows that crime doesn't either."
00:15:35.267,00:15:38.729,"You and I could theorize all night, but the truth is, I don't fucking know."
00:15:38.812,00:15:41.023,-I don't know either. -No one does.
00:15:41.106,00:15:42.691,"But we're supposed to, right?"
00:15:42.775,00:15:47.237,"Sure, but here's the troubling thing: no one's even asking the questions."
00:15:51.116,00:15:52.034,We are.
00:15:52.701,00:15:53.702,We are.
00:15:56.622,00:15:57.915,Mm!
00:15:59.333,00:16:02.586,"Next time, let's discuss Lee Harvey Oswald as Oedipus."
00:16:04.463,00:16:05.589,-Thank you. -Anytime.
00:16:17.893,00:16:19.395,-Hey. -Hey.
00:16:19.812,00:16:21.063,What are you looking at?
00:16:21.814,00:16:22.940,I like your outfit.
00:16:23.482,00:16:25.901,"What is that, a jumpsuit? What do you call that?"
00:16:25.985,00:16:28.112,-This? I call it a jumpsuit. -Stylish.
00:16:28.195,00:16:30.698,What do you call that? You look like a Mormon.
00:16:31.156,00:16:32.282,You look like my dad.
00:16:32.366,00:16:33.409,Is he a Mormon?
00:16:33.492,00:16:34.910,"No, but he looks like one."
00:16:34.994,00:16:36.203,So does mine.
00:16:36.286,00:16:38.622,"He bought me this suit, as a matter of fact."
00:16:38.706,00:16:41.041,Did he buy you those nice shiny shoes?
00:16:41.458,00:16:42.334,Yes.
00:16:42.918,00:16:45.421,I have one brown pair and one black pair.
00:16:46.255,00:16:48.590,"I've got sneakers, but I had to buy those myself."
00:16:48.674,00:16:51.844,What kind of grown-up lets their parents choose their clothes for them?
00:16:53.679,00:16:56.682,-Are you coming on to me? -How do you like my approach?
00:17:02.354,00:17:03.981,You having a good time?
00:17:04.064,00:17:05.733,-I will be. -Huh!
00:17:05.816,00:17:07.026,It's my birthday today.
00:17:07.109,00:17:09.361,Happy birthday. How old are you?
00:17:09.445,00:17:12.197,-Twenty-four. -You don't look old enough to be in here.
00:17:12.281,00:17:14.533,"-What are you, a narc? -FBI, actually."
00:17:16.035,00:17:17.786,Special Agent Holden Ford.
00:17:17.870,00:17:19.204,Wow.
00:17:20.998,00:17:23.042,-Can you tell? -Everybody can tell.
00:17:23.625,00:17:24.501,You got a gun?
00:17:24.585,00:17:26.795,"I have one, but I'm not gonna show it to you."
00:17:26.879,00:17:27.796,Nuts.
00:17:28.630,00:17:31.175,I'm a teacher. Right up the road at Quantico.
00:17:31.258,00:17:32.384,What do you teach?
00:17:33.260,00:17:36.263,"Hostage negotiation, such as it is."
00:17:36.346,00:17:39.183,-Holy cow. -You really think I look like a narc?
00:17:39.266,00:17:41.435,-Are you kidding? -I don't see it.
00:17:41.518,00:17:43.228,You stick out like a sore thumb.
00:17:44.646,00:17:48.400,"Well, I'm not here to... infiltrate the Black Panthers."
00:17:48.734,00:17:52.404,Those guys are hardly Black Panthers. They're engineering students.
00:17:52.863,00:17:54.323,You should go talk to them.
00:17:54.406,00:17:57.367,I'm sure the FBI's in need of some great-looking black dudes.
00:17:57.451,00:18:00.621,-You've got the wrong idea about me. -You gonna book me?
00:18:00.704,00:18:01.872,Maybe.
00:18:01.955,00:18:02.998,Handcuffs?
00:18:08.170,00:18:10.506,I'm here to see this really cool band from Detroit.
00:18:11.048,00:18:12.424,You ever been to Detroit?
00:18:13.217,00:18:20.891,"Yes, actually. I was a-- I was a brick agent there for a couple of years."
00:18:21.308,00:18:24.645,I can't believe they're here. They used to play PJ's in Corktown.
00:18:25.395,00:18:26.814,-You know Corktown? -Sure.
00:18:26.897,00:18:29.358,-It looked like a furniture store. -They always sold liquor.
00:18:29.441,00:18:32.820,The whole furniture thing was just a front that started during Prohibition.
00:18:32.903,00:18:34.321,Where are you really from?
00:18:36.615,00:18:38.283,"But the Midwest, right?"
00:18:38.367,00:18:41.328,"I grew up in the Midwest, but I was born in Brooklyn."
00:18:41.411,00:18:43.789,You do not seem like a guy from New York.
00:18:44.873,00:18:47.042,You don't seem like a girl from Corktown.
00:18:50.129,00:18:51.380,Buy you a drink?
00:21:42.384,00:21:44.803,-You want some pot? -Is that a trick question?
00:21:44.886,00:21:45.887,Come on.
00:21:46.263,00:21:48.390,"Are you serious? No, that's completely inappropriate."
00:21:48.473,00:21:50.225,"Come on, it's my birthday."
00:21:50.309,00:21:52.811,"Oh, Jesus, you're not gonna drink and drive, are you?"
00:21:52.894,00:21:54.354,You've been plying me with booze.
00:21:54.438,00:21:56.732,Don't you think that's kind of a mixed message?
00:22:01.069,00:22:01.987,You coming?
00:22:20.005,00:22:23.383,So what does a brick agent get up to in Detroit?
00:22:23.884,00:22:25.761,Mostly corralling Army deserters.
00:22:26.595,00:22:29.097,Guys AWOL from Vietnam trying to get to Canada.
00:22:30.390,00:22:31.600,Too scared to go back.
00:22:32.267,00:22:34.603,Young guys. Same age I was.
00:22:35.103,00:22:36.688,So you were a snitch?
00:22:38.940,00:22:40.942,There's worse things than being a snitch.
00:22:44.029,00:22:46.615,Maybe this'll loosen you up.
00:22:50.243,00:22:51.870,"God, you are making me nervous."
00:22:52.704,00:22:54.289,You are such a goody-goody.
00:22:55.874,00:22:57.709,"What are you, some kind of honey trap?"
00:22:58.210,00:23:00.253,I've been warned to watch out for women like you.
00:23:02.005,00:23:03.215,You mean normal ones?
00:23:10.889,00:23:13.475,So just put your mouth over the hole...
00:23:49.219,00:23:50.971,-Get somebody in charge. -I am in charge!
00:23:51.054,00:23:54.850,I don't want to talk to some flunky pig trying to calm me. What's he doing?
00:23:54.933,00:23:57.060,-Will you get back over there? -What are they there for?
00:23:57.144,00:23:59.771,"Will you get the fuck back? Get back there, will ya?"
00:23:59.855,00:24:01.189,-Look at him! -Get over there!
00:24:01.273,00:24:03.900,"-Go back there, man! -Get over there, will ya?"
00:24:03.984,00:24:06.945,"He wants to kill me so bad, he can taste it! All right?"
00:24:07.028,00:24:09.656,Attica! Attica! Attica!
00:24:13.952,00:24:16.997,Attica! Attica! Attica!
00:24:22.252,00:24:23.670,"What sort of things, Leon?"
00:24:28.592,00:24:29.718,After the wedding...
00:24:31.052,00:24:33.471,I ran off for ten days to Atlantic City.
00:24:34.973,00:24:36.516,Sonny was frantic.
00:24:37.267,00:24:40.979,"He knew I'd been drinking, he didn't know where I was, who I was with."
00:24:46.234,00:24:47.861,So I went to a psychiatrist...
00:24:48.528,00:24:49.654,who told me...
00:24:50.780,00:24:54.242,that I was a woman trapped in a man's body.
00:25:03.752,00:25:08.798,"but he was married, and his boyfriend wanted to become a woman, which is confusing."
00:25:08.882,00:25:11.301,"-You really gotta get out more, Holden. -It was mixed up."
00:25:11.384,00:25:14.012,"-You didn't like it? -No, I really liked it."
00:25:14.095,00:25:16.765,It was just so... sad.
00:25:16.848,00:25:20.310,"He was obviously very disturbed, but somehow I liked him."
00:25:20.393,00:25:22.604,"-Yeah, you have empathy. -Yeah."
00:25:23.355,00:25:24.439,Empathy.
00:25:24.981,00:25:27.776,I really liked the dialogue. It was just very real.
00:25:27.859,00:25:32.113,"When I started at the Academy, they would send women out of the room if there was any of that talk."
00:25:32.197,00:25:34.449,They called it deviant terminology.
00:25:34.532,00:25:36.785,We even had a list of words we had to memorize.
00:25:36.868,00:25:38.578,Really? Which words?
00:25:39.955,00:25:40.997,You know...
00:25:41.081,00:25:44.459,"fuck, shit, pussy... blow job."
00:25:46.545,00:25:47.379,"Oh, fuck."
00:25:48.004,00:25:48.922,Shit.
00:25:51.633,00:25:53.051,Finger my pussy.
00:25:54.886,00:25:57.097,"Finger my pussy, I'll give you a blow job."
00:26:00.850,00:26:02.811,All the bad words used in a sentence.
00:26:13.446,00:26:17.450,He says she hit her head on the bedpost having consensual sexual intercourse.
00:26:17.534,00:26:21.121,She says he knocked her out and dragged her into this motel room to rape her.
00:26:21.204,00:26:25.166,We know she didn't hit her head on that bedpost because we've measured.
00:26:27.127,00:26:29.045,University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
00:26:29.129,00:26:30.130,Studying what?
00:26:30.213,00:26:33.675,Contemporary Applied Criminal Psychology. Ratchet things up a notch.
00:26:33.758,00:26:35.760,What exactly is it you think you're missing out on?
00:26:35.844,00:26:37.679,We need to know the current academic thinking.
00:26:37.762,00:26:39.723,"No, you don't want to rely on academics, Holden."
00:26:39.806,00:26:42.225,"I'm not saying rely, just get updated."
00:26:42.309,00:26:43.643,We just got updated.
00:26:43.727,00:26:46.980,"It's all in the library. 1972, everything was new."
00:26:47.063,00:26:48.773,That was five years ago.
00:26:49.941,00:26:51.276,What's the thinking now?
00:26:51.359,00:26:52.569,"Okay, look."
00:26:53.528,00:26:59.701,"There have been some fine psychological studies over the years, but these are people who don't understand the criminal mind."
00:26:59.784,00:27:03.121,"They understand their corner of the world, which is a very small corner."
00:27:03.204,00:27:05.540,"Well, they must know something."
00:27:10.295,00:27:11.755,I'm going to level with you.
00:27:13.048,00:27:16.384,I'm going to tell you something I really don't want you to repeat.
00:27:17.093,00:27:22.182,"As far as the Bureau is concerned, psychology is for backroom boys."
00:27:27.270,00:27:28.980,No. What's a backroom boy?
00:27:30.774,00:27:32.317,It's just frowned upon.
00:27:34.652,00:27:36.738,We should be using every resource we can.
00:27:38.323,00:27:41.826,Talking to the smartest people we find from the broadest possible spectrum.
00:27:41.910,00:27:44.371,"-And we do. -Otherwise, it's like the military."
00:27:44.454,00:27:46.956,"-Hey, we recruited Elvis. -So did the military."
00:27:47.040,00:27:48.792,The King doesn't do it for you?
00:27:48.875,00:27:54.881,"Hoover died over five years ago, and we're still recruiting accountants and lawyers like it's 1946."
00:27:54.964,00:27:57.133,"Actually, recruitment has tapered off."
00:27:57.217,00:28:00.261,"-We can't get accountants. -Well, then we're in trouble."
00:28:03.431,00:28:09.020,"and recommend funding for you to audit a few classes, but you will be expected to use the opportunity for recruitment."
00:28:09.938,00:28:11.898,"Speakers, lecturers, great minds."
00:28:11.981,00:28:15.527,"-Are you sure you want me doing that? -You're smart, you're idealistic..."
00:28:15.735,00:28:16.903,more than a little sensitive.
00:28:17.487,00:28:18.655,They're gonna love you.
00:28:42.804,00:28:45.306,-Hare Krishna. -Hare Krishna.
00:28:49.394,00:29:14.919,"Italian physician Cesare Lombroso drags us out of the Dark Ages and launches the scientific era in criminology by differentiating five criminal classes: the born criminal, insane criminal, criminal by passion, habitual criminal, and the occasional criminal."
00:29:15.003,00:29:20.425,"In other words, there are those that are born that way and those who become that way."
00:29:20.508,00:29:22.427,"And in 1965, there's this other breakthrough."
00:29:22.510,00:29:35.690,This criminal psychology research project at Bellevue psychiatric hospital in New York couched it like this: personality and character far outweigh the presence of psychotic or defective diagnoses.
00:29:35.774,00:29:38.526,"In other words, by extrapolation..."
00:29:39.360,00:29:40.820,are criminals born...
00:29:42.322,00:29:44.115,or are they formed?
00:30:04.969,00:30:06.137,Do you mind if I sit?
00:30:06.596,00:30:07.430,You're sitting.
00:30:11.643,00:30:13.770,"You know, I wasn't aware of that project at Bellevue."
00:30:13.853,00:30:15.688,"Well, you should be."
00:30:16.689,00:30:19.400,"Where I come from, criminals are always born that way."
00:30:19.484,00:30:21.319,Some people will never stop believing that.
00:30:22.320,00:30:23.905,-It's too easy. -It lets us off the hook.
00:30:23.988,00:30:25.865,"Well, essentially we're a puritan nation."
00:30:25.949,00:30:29.202,We blame all our problems on a minority of bad apples.
00:30:29.285,00:30:31.704,What's your name again? I'm sorry. Is it Leon?
00:30:33.790,00:30:34.666,Leo.
00:30:34.749,00:30:35.583,Holden.
00:30:36.376,00:30:38.503,-Holden Ford. -I know who you are.
00:30:39.462,00:30:40.463,Everybody does.
00:30:40.547,00:30:41.506,Yeah.
00:30:42.715,00:30:44.717,I've noticed some of the looks I've been getting.
00:30:44.801,00:30:47.679,Funny looks isn't a federal offense... yet.
00:30:48.346,00:30:49.848,"Yeah, they're just curious."
00:30:50.306,00:30:51.474,"Well, I'm not a spy."
00:30:51.891,00:30:53.226,This isn't some kind of cover.
00:30:53.309,00:30:57.105,Good. Because that... would have been a really pathetic cover.
00:30:58.064,00:31:01.234,"I'm actually an instructor too, but I'm just here to learn."
00:31:01.317,00:31:04.195,And I'm here to talk to people like you.
00:31:04.279,00:31:05.697,What do you want to talk about?
00:31:05.780,00:31:08.157,I want to start a dialogue with you.
00:31:08.241,00:31:09.409,Would be that okay?
00:31:10.201,00:31:11.578,A dialogue about what?
00:31:12.120,00:31:15.874,I'm an instructor in the Bureau's training and recruitment program out of Quantico.
00:31:15.957,00:31:18.793,And we really need to hear from people like you.
00:31:18.877,00:31:22.964,"I'm sorry, are you trying to recruit me?"
00:31:23.047,00:31:25.717,Just to hear your perspectives and your insights.
00:31:32.765,00:31:33.808,perfectly.
00:31:36.311,00:31:39.731,I'm sorry. You call yourself a professor of criminal psychology.
00:31:40.315,00:31:43.276,But you won't even talk to the educational arm of the FBI?
00:31:43.359,00:31:44.319,It's just...
00:31:45.236,00:31:46.613,"a sign of the times, man."
00:31:51.534,00:31:57.165,"seriously believe that they're worthy of an enormously costly, labor-intensive federal surveillance operation?"
00:31:57.248,00:31:59.292,It sounds like the contempt is mutual.
00:31:59.667,00:32:05.089,Don't you think that the traditional counterculture-law enforcement enmity is a little old hat by now?
00:32:05.590,00:32:08.760,They'll never forgive you for putting a tail on John and Yoko.
00:32:09.594,00:32:15.183,"Frankly, I'm surprised to have aroused such a degree of fucking neuroses amongst supposedly intelligent people."
00:32:15.266,00:32:17.560,"Please, they're flattering themselves."
00:32:25.485,00:32:27.278,There. You're one of us now.
00:32:27.362,00:32:31.115,"Okay, everything's all right. Come on. Right. Yeah. Okay."
00:32:33.242,00:32:35.119,"-Come on out, Sonny. -They're too close!"
00:32:35.203,00:32:37.830,"Come on, get back! What the fuck are you doing? Get back!"
00:32:37.914,00:32:38.873,Get them back.
00:32:38.957,00:32:40.833,"-Get back, okay? -Come here."
00:32:41.542,00:32:42.835,Come on out.
00:32:42.919,00:32:45.046,Now take a look at this. Come on.
00:32:45.588,00:32:47.340,"Hey, look. Look up here. Look."
00:32:48.591,00:32:49.550,Look.
00:32:50.551,00:32:52.136,Look over here. Huh?
00:32:56.933,00:32:59.394,"Over there. Look. You got everything here, okay?"
00:33:09.529,00:33:12.073,Okay. So what are they doing wrong?
00:33:12.657,00:33:15.743,-They're making him mad. -They're making him scared.
00:33:16.202,00:33:19.956,-So? -We do not want him scared.
00:33:20.039,00:33:22.625,We want him calm.
00:33:28.840,00:33:32.885,"Let me call and see what they say. I'll talk to them and ask, all right?"
00:33:32.969,00:33:35.013,Then we'll see. Anything else I can give you?
00:33:39.058,00:33:41.477,"Yeah, I want you to bring my wife down here."
00:33:42.395,00:33:43.771,"Okay, what do you give us?"
00:33:44.022,00:33:45.023,What do you want?
00:33:47.358,00:33:51.946,The guy is robbing a bank to pay for a sex change for his boyfriend.
00:33:52.030,00:33:54.365,He wants a helicopter with a piano.
00:33:54.907,00:33:58.453,"But more than anything, he wants to talk to his wife."
00:34:05.251,00:34:08.713,Always expect complicated.
00:34:08.796,00:34:10.423,"Okay, I need you to concentrate."
00:34:10.506,00:34:13.885,"Think of an opening salvo, then think where it could lead."
00:34:14.552,00:34:18.890,"No right or wrong answers, just use your imagination and see where it takes you."
00:34:19.348,00:34:21.142,Start whenever you like. Go ahead.
00:34:24.020,00:34:26.898,"All right. I'm asking you to put the gun down, Mike."
00:34:26.981,00:34:28.858,"No way. Kiss my black ass, Mark."
00:34:28.941,00:34:30.234,"Wait, what?"
00:34:30.777,00:34:33.738,"For the purpose of this exercise, I'm imagining I'm Negro."
00:34:35.448,00:34:39.285,That's good. That's fine. Keep it going. Just whatever comes into your head.
00:34:42.080,00:34:44.082,Then fuck you! I asked you to put that gun down.
00:34:44.624,00:34:46.542,"No, fuck you, you dumb cracker motherfucker."
00:34:46.626,00:34:48.294,"Wait, wait a minute. What is all that?"
00:34:48.377,00:34:49.504,It's jive talk.
00:34:49.587,00:34:51.839,We don't need to get into that. Forget vernacular.
00:34:51.923,00:34:54.300,"In real life, people just press their demands."
00:34:54.383,00:34:55.301,All right?
00:34:58.763,00:35:01.182,"Uh... put the gun down, Steve."
00:35:01.766,00:35:04.477,We brought your children to see you.
00:35:04.560,00:35:05.520,You what?
00:35:05.603,00:35:10.608,"Oh, my God. I lost custody. I haven't seen my children in years."
00:35:13.694,00:35:17.615,Important not to talk to a divorced man about his children. Different tactic.
00:35:20.284,00:35:23.454,"All right, I asked nicely. Now put the fucking gun down."
00:35:25.915,00:35:27.250,"I'm no faggot, motherfucker!"
00:35:27.333,00:35:29.710,"Okay, let's dial it back a little."
00:35:29.794,00:35:31.796,Excuse me. What is the point of this?
00:35:33.214,00:35:35.800,Psychologically preparing you for reality.
00:35:35.883,00:35:38.261,"And the reality is, you have to talk to them."
00:35:38.344,00:35:41.013,"Somebody demands the impossible, you can't just shoot him."
00:35:41.097,00:35:42.723,Then why have so much firearms training?
00:35:42.807,00:35:45.810,"Well, because that is a tactical response for when all else fails."
00:35:45.893,00:35:50.606,"But if local law enforcement can't shut something down, then it has required a tactical response."
00:35:50.690,00:35:53.109,"Okay, but wouldn't you like to try something different?"
00:35:53.317,00:35:55.987,Or would you rather use firearms all the time?
00:35:57.572,00:35:59.991,-I'd kind of rather use firearms. -Why?
00:36:01.576,00:36:02.535,Seems safer?
00:36:06.956,00:36:09.584,"Holden, I enjoyed that immensely. What do you call that?"
00:36:09.667,00:36:12.587,It's just role-playing in a simulated hostage situation.
00:36:12.670,00:36:14.213,-Stimulated? -Simulated.
00:36:14.297,00:36:16.591,"All that profanity, is that an academic thing?"
00:36:16.674,00:36:19.135,They're improvising. They're learning to create a dialogue.
00:36:19.218,00:36:21.220,How is all that cursing creating a dialogue?
00:36:21.304,00:36:22.763,It's not really about the cursing.
00:36:22.847,00:36:28.144,"I'm sure it's all quite modern and fashionable in academic circles, but it seems very theatrical to me."
00:36:28.227,00:36:32.899,"Well, in criminal psych, role-playing exercises are considered a valuable tool, with or without the cursing."
00:36:32.982,00:36:35.693,I think we have enough exercises here at the Academy.
00:36:36.194,00:36:40.156,"If you're going to start implementing new ones, talk to somebody in the Behavioral Science Unit."
00:36:40.239,00:36:41.073,They can help?
00:36:41.157,00:36:44.327,They can go over the soundness of the psychology. That's their thing.
00:36:44.410,00:36:45.786,"Okay, good idea."
00:36:45.870,00:36:47.955,-Why don't I set that up? -Okay.
00:36:48.039,00:36:49.582,"Thank you, yes."
00:37:06.265,00:37:08.392,"Holden, right? Holden Ford?"
00:37:08.476,00:37:09.435,Hi.
00:37:09.518,00:37:11.395,Bill Tench. Behavioral Science.
00:37:11.479,00:37:13.147,"Oh, great to meet you."
00:37:13.731,00:37:16.484,-You had a beer with Peter Rathman? -Interesting guy.
00:37:16.984,00:37:19.737,I was kind of disturbed by what he said.
00:37:19.820,00:37:20.738,"You were, huh?"
00:37:21.864,00:37:24.450,-Can we sit? -Yes. Please.
00:37:30.706,00:37:33.209,"-Smoke? -Oh, uh..."
00:37:33.292,00:37:34.752,I don't smoke when I eat.
00:37:34.835,00:37:36.087,Want to go outside?
00:37:37.713,00:37:39.548,I don't smoke when I don't eat either.
00:37:43.844,00:37:46.138,So did Shepard talk to you about my thing?
00:37:46.389,00:37:47.431,He did his best.
00:37:48.432,00:37:49.433,What does that mean?
00:37:54.230,00:37:59.694,"I call this place the country club, because, you know, it can be a little starchy sometimes."
00:38:00.569,00:38:01.821,I hear that.
00:38:03.656,00:38:05.241,"You went back to college, right?"
00:38:05.866,00:38:06.867,UVA.
00:38:07.868,00:38:09.829,"How old are you, 26, 27?"
00:38:09.912,00:38:10.871,Twenty-nine.
00:38:11.956,00:38:13.040,That's interesting.
00:38:13.541,00:38:18.004,Lot of guys your age don't want to go back to school because they feel it undermines their authority.
00:38:18.629,00:38:21.382,I was hoping it would give me some authority.
00:38:22.550,00:38:24.176,"He's got you doing recruitment, right?"
00:38:24.260,00:38:28.723,"Yeah, well, I'm there, so I might as well make myself useful."
00:38:29.849,00:38:31.851,Most guys don't want to get stuck doing recruitment.
00:38:31.934,00:38:33.936,They're busy working their way upwards.
00:38:34.478,00:38:36.689,I guess I'm busy working my way sideways.
00:38:37.690,00:38:40.943,You are what they call a blue flamer. You know what that is?
00:38:42.445,00:38:43.529,No. What does that mean?
00:38:43.612,00:38:47.908,"You're so eager to do good, you have a big, blue flame shooting out of your asshole."
00:38:48.743,00:38:51.662,Oh... is that bad?
00:38:52.079,00:38:54.623,Just take it slow. You'll get there in the end.
00:38:56.667,00:38:58.919,I'm just trying to be a better instructor.
00:39:00.796,00:39:03.507,"Right. Well, I was thinking about that."
00:39:04.675,00:39:06.510,I started this thing a couple of years ago.
00:39:06.594,00:39:12.516,"I go on the road and give classes in various police departments from Buffalo, New York to San Diego, California."
00:39:12.975,00:39:15.436,There's a million cops out there who want to know what we know.
00:39:15.936,00:39:20.691,"So I go to them, give them a distillation of what we teach here, and they tell me what they've been doing."
00:39:20.775,00:39:25.321,"They learn something, and I learn something firsthand by getting involved on their level."
00:39:25.988,00:39:27.365,"But it's a big job, you know?"
00:39:27.448,00:39:29.617,I'm up to my neck in local law enforcement.
00:39:32.411,00:39:33.996,Would you want some help with that?
00:39:36.540,00:39:38.042,Maybe we could help each other.
00:39:50.346,00:39:51.305,What?
00:39:51.389,00:39:52.264,Nothing.
00:39:57.103,00:39:58.562,Don't be shy.
00:39:59.063,00:40:00.189,Did you orgasm?
00:40:00.272,00:40:01.690,Did I orgasm?
00:40:01.774,00:40:02.775,What?
00:40:03.359,00:40:06.821,"-I can't believe you're from New York. -You could be faking, right?"
00:40:07.071,00:40:08.906,You can't tell if a woman is faking?
00:40:08.989,00:40:11.158,I can't even tell if a woman is interested.
00:40:11.826,00:40:14.954,"But you can tell if somebody's lying, like a suspect."
00:40:15.037,00:40:16.747,That is not the same thing.
00:40:18.791,00:40:21.293,"Use your powers of deduction, Agent Ford."
00:40:22.503,00:40:26.257,How can you figure out the criminal mind if you can't figure out your girlfriend?
00:40:27.675,00:40:28.926,Are you my girlfriend?
00:40:29.343,00:40:32.847,Wait. Is this another of those things you just can't tell?
00:40:33.389,00:40:35.599,I don't know. Are you?
00:40:36.183,00:40:38.769,"What do you need, an exchange of rings over milkshakes?"
00:40:38.853,00:40:40.771,I just didn't want to presume anything.
00:40:41.230,00:40:43.649,"Really, Holden, sometimes you're like a monk."
00:40:44.525,00:40:47.570,Surely people in law enforcement shouldn't be so naive.
00:40:47.653,00:40:49.238,Does it make you uncomfortable...
00:40:50.531,00:40:52.032,sleeping with a federal agent?
00:40:54.785,00:40:56.203,Where did that come from?
00:40:58.747,00:41:00.082,Does it turn you on?
00:41:01.625,00:41:02.793,Not at all.
00:41:08.090,00:41:09.467,Then why are you with me?
00:41:10.801,00:41:12.303,You're smart.
00:41:14.930,00:41:16.474,You're nice.
00:41:19.727,00:41:21.896,What? Those are good things.
00:41:24.732,00:41:26.817,And you're devastating.
00:41:28.319,00:41:29.445,"Well, thank you."
00:41:30.237,00:41:31.655,"Oh, come on, you're not leaving."
00:41:32.907,00:41:34.283,I have to get up early.
00:41:34.867,00:41:36.577,Tomorrow's the first day of school.
00:42:01.769,00:42:03.354,-Just follow my lead. -What happened?
00:42:03.771,00:42:05.898,They caught a big case and they're spooked.
00:42:05.981,00:42:07.441,Don't talk to any reporters.
00:42:08.150,00:42:11.237,"And please, for God's sake, don't say we're from the FBI."
00:42:24.208,00:42:27.169,"Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm from the Fairfield Chronicle."
00:42:27.253,00:42:29.380,"You gentlemen are from the FBI, is that right?"
00:42:29.463,00:42:31.048,How are things with the Jeffries case?
00:42:31.131,00:42:32.758,No idea what you're talking about.
00:42:32.841,00:42:34.426,The Jeffries case. Ada Jeffries.
00:42:34.510,00:42:37.596,-You can come back for the rest. -The woman found behind the church.
00:42:37.680,00:42:40.266,-We're here for something else. -The woman and her little boy.
00:42:40.349,00:42:41.725,We're instructors.
00:42:41.809,00:42:43.269,Are you from the Methodist church?
00:42:43.352,00:42:45.354,Do we look like we're from the Methodist church?
00:42:45.437,00:42:46.397,Yes.
00:42:46.939,00:42:47.940,Make a hole.
00:42:49.525,00:42:50.693,Good to see ya.
00:42:54.196,00:42:57.575,The three pillars of criminal investigation for the last century.
00:42:58.158,00:43:01.704,"But it's 1977, and suddenly motive is elusive."
00:43:03.372,00:43:04.748,"What, why, who."
00:43:05.291,00:43:08.168,What happened? Why did it happen that way?
00:43:08.252,00:43:10.087,Which should lead to: Who did it?
00:43:11.130,00:43:14.258,"A person is murdered. Not sexually assaulted, not robbed."
00:43:14.633,00:43:16.677,But the body is mutilated posthumously.
00:43:17.177,00:43:22.016,"The question is not only why did the killer do it, but why did the killer do it this way?"
00:43:23.100,00:43:27.187,We are now talking about... psychology.
00:43:33.277,00:43:43.621,"the perpetrator is standing right in front of me, but I have to gauge how much destruction he's capable of, what in his background or personal life that could've triggered today's standoff."
00:43:43.704,00:43:45.247,"Some people are just crazy, right?"
00:43:45.789,00:43:47.958,Crazy in that they have no reason for what they do?
00:43:49.460,00:43:53.922,"But keep in mind, often, this crazy person has never done anything like this before."
00:43:54.006,00:43:55.799,Something just... flips.
00:43:56.383,00:43:58.260,"-Like a switch. -Good, a switch."
00:43:58.761,00:44:00.220,Anybody know what flips it?
00:44:01.180,00:44:03.474,-Getting fired? -Fired. Yes.
00:44:05.017,00:44:07.227,A romantic breakup is a top trigger.
00:44:07.728,00:44:11.523,"When we know who the criminal is, we can understand what set him off."
00:44:11.607,00:44:13.817,"In a homicide situation, we do the inverse."
00:44:14.234,00:44:18.572,"We ask, What happened? Why did it happen that way?"
00:44:18.656,00:44:20.783,Which narrows the search for who did it.
00:44:21.283,00:44:24.578,But what if our killer is someone who's not rational?
00:44:31.251,00:44:33.170,Why do we behave the way we do?
00:44:34.713,00:44:40.511,"It's a question asked by poets, and philosophers, and theologians since time immemorial."
00:44:40.928,00:44:44.765,"The playground of Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, Freud."
00:44:44.848,00:44:48.435,The stuff of Crime and Punishment and Beyond the Pleasure Principal.
00:44:49.687,00:44:53.941,The greatest minds in history have been fascinated by the vagaries of behavior.
00:44:56.485,00:45:01.490,"So, in a case where we can't immediately divine a motive, we shouldn't panic."
00:45:02.199,00:45:04.034,"It's a riddle, but it can be solved."
00:45:04.118,00:45:07.996,"It's complex, but... it's human."
00:45:13.460,00:45:15.504,That was very... illuminating.
00:45:18.632,00:45:21.176,So what the hell's Beyond the Pleasure Principle?
00:45:24.179,00:45:43.323,"Actually, it's where he looks for human impulses beyond sex, Freud suggests that there's an innate desire for destruction, based on the propensity for matter to return-- we've always looked at motive as need or greed, right?"
00:45:46.368,00:45:49.371,"But let's say, while he's at it, he steals your wife's panties, too."
00:45:49.455,00:45:51.165,"If he stole my wife's panties, I'd be amazed."
00:45:53.876,00:45:56.170,So why does he do it? Is it merely prurient?
00:45:56.253,00:45:58.755,He could be motivated by something he doesn't even understand.
00:45:58.839,00:46:04.761,"Our new quest, like Freud, is to look beyond what we assume are obvious impulses."
00:46:04.845,00:46:06.513,So why didn't you just say that?
00:46:16.773,00:46:17.983,What's wrong with complicated?
00:46:18.066,00:46:20.944,"There's complicated and there's too complicated, Holden."
00:46:24.156,00:46:27.075,We used to do this experiment in social psychology.
00:46:27.618,00:46:28.952,Uh-huh. What was that?
00:46:29.328,00:46:36.543,"You get onto a crowded elevator, and you face the opposite direction, the back of the elevator, and everybody freaks out."
00:46:37.044,00:46:40.380,They're uncomfortable for reasons they can't even articulate.
00:46:41.465,00:46:45.803,"But if you turn around and face the front, everybody relaxes."
00:46:46.386,00:46:49.014,"Okay. Well, how do we do that?"
00:46:51.934,00:46:53.310,What do we have in common?
00:46:55.437,00:46:56.647,What unites us?
00:46:58.649,00:47:01.527,What keeps us all awake at night?
00:47:10.118,00:47:11.537,I think we can all agree.
00:47:13.622,00:47:15.457,But what do you really know about him?
00:47:16.333,00:47:19.044,Did you know that his mother was a jailbird and a prostitute?
00:47:19.419,00:47:28.679,"Did you know when he was ten years old, she palmed him off onto his sadistic, Bible-thumping uncle who beat him within an inch of his life and taunted him to act like a man?"
00:47:29.513,00:47:36.353,"Charles responded to that by becoming a pimp and an armed robber, and was incarcerated for over 20 years, where he continued to be brutalized."
00:47:36.436,00:47:41.275,"In 1967, he was paroled, during the Summer of Love."
00:47:42.067,00:47:43.443,And our nightmare began.
00:47:54.621,00:47:59.835,"Here we have a child who was unwanted, unloved, regularly beaten, and repeatedly institutionalized."
00:47:59.918,00:48:03.964,"Now, might this not have had some sort of an effect on him?"
00:48:04.631,00:48:07.050,-He was born that way. -What way?
00:48:12.556,00:48:15.892,Look at those eyes. How can you not say that dude's evil?
00:48:15.976,00:48:19.646,"That's a little bit Old Testament, don't you think?"
00:48:19.730,00:48:23.483,"Good, evil, black, white, it's easy."
00:48:23.859,00:48:26.695,But who in this room has a life that's easy?
00:48:27.529,00:48:30.032,Circumstances affect behavior.
00:48:30.699,00:48:36.288,"When we look at Manson's background, the real question is, how could we not have seen this coming?"
00:48:36.371,00:48:37.331,We did.
00:48:39.124,00:48:42.586,He was institutionalized because we could see it coming.
00:48:42.669,00:48:48.967,"Okay, but I'm saying maybe, just maybe, locking him up his young life helped make him what he was."
00:48:50.844,00:48:53.221,They locked him up because of what he did.
00:48:53.305,00:48:54.765,They already knew what he was.
00:48:54.848,00:48:57.934,"Okay, guys, I'm not asking anybody to feel sorry for Charles Manson."
00:48:58.018,00:49:00.771,"If he were here, I'd shoot him dead. No one would stop me."
00:49:01.772,00:49:03.982,What Holden's trying to say is maybe it's both.
00:49:04.066,00:49:06.234,The one impacting on the other in a vicious circle.
00:49:06.318,00:49:08.487,Nobody has all the answers.
00:49:08.570,00:49:11.490,-We have some answers. -We should be asking questions.
00:49:12.908,00:49:20.999,"Well, I'll just tell my buddies in Robbery-Homicide who were there when the corpses were found, that they may have overlooked a difficult upbringing."
00:49:21.083,00:49:22.459,You were LAPD?
00:49:22.542,00:49:23.877,Twenty-two years.
00:49:25.128,00:49:26.254,You worked Manson?
00:49:26.338,00:49:28.548,"No, but I knew every single man who did."
00:49:29.925,00:49:31.718,How many homicides have you worked?
00:49:35.472,00:49:40.185,Figure out who you're talking to before you tell a sob story about little Chuckie Manson.
00:49:40.268,00:49:42.521,They wrote pigs on the wall in their victims' blood.
00:49:42.604,00:49:44.147,They completely missed my point.
00:49:44.231,00:49:47.526,"In the future, ask if anyone's worked a case before you bring it up."
00:49:47.609,00:49:50.445,"-Know your fucking audience. -Oh, shit."
00:49:51.405,00:49:53.699,"It's okay, they always do this."
00:49:53.782,00:49:55.534,Just be a good listener.
00:49:55.617,00:49:56.535,Gentlemen.
00:49:58.203,00:49:59.204,Frank McGraw.
00:50:00.163,00:50:02.165,I didn't mean to embarrass anybody back there.
00:50:02.249,00:50:03.375,Not a problem.
00:50:03.458,00:50:05.544,We're all a little tense around here.
00:50:05.627,00:50:09.297,You must have heard about the mother and child who were murdered recently.
00:50:09.381,00:50:12.175,-Ada Jeffries and her boy. -We've seen reporters.
00:50:13.385,00:50:17.347,"She was bound, stabbed repeatedly about the chest and face."
00:50:18.014,00:50:19.266,The boy's throat was cut.
00:50:22.436,00:50:26.273,I don't understand entirely what you're talking about with psychology.
00:50:27.649,00:50:30.068,I don't understand much of anything anymore.
00:50:30.152,00:50:31.737,"What's on your mind, Frank?"
00:50:34.030,00:50:36.616,"-I hate to bother. -No, by all means. Bother us."
00:50:43.081,00:50:46.960,"When I left Los Angeles, I thought I'd gone far enough."
00:50:49.755,00:50:53.258,Ada was the kind of woman who wouldn't say boo to a goose.
00:50:53.800,00:50:56.553,She came from a deeply religious family in Arkansas.
00:50:57.095,00:50:59.890,"When they found out she was pregnant, they put her out."
00:51:00.390,00:51:02.934,She lived in a rooming house in Libertyville.
00:51:03.018,00:51:07.564,"No drugs, no alcohol, never had a brush with the law."
00:51:08.315,00:51:10.484,The boy was polite and quiet.
00:51:11.151,00:51:13.904,She had him in Sunday school at the Methodist church.
00:51:14.237,00:51:19.743,"She would sweep the steps every evening, just to be of service."
00:51:21.495,00:51:22.829,I never met Ada.
00:51:23.747,00:51:27.417,"Every now and again, I'd see her and her son walk along the road into town."
00:51:28.502,00:51:29.711,They didn't have a car.
00:51:32.422,00:51:34.174,Landlady found the bodies.
00:51:37.219,00:51:38.470,They had been dead...
00:51:40.680,00:51:41.681,four days.
00:51:47.938,00:51:49.773,What people won't do to each other.
00:51:50.941,00:51:52.526,Nothing people won't do.
00:51:54.653,00:51:55.862,How can we help?
00:52:02.244,00:52:04.538,A broomstick perforated her rectum.
00:52:05.539,00:52:11.169,"Whoever it was made the boy watch, then did the same thing to him."
00:52:12.420,00:52:13.463,How'd he get in?
00:52:13.839,00:52:16.633,Bathroom window. We think that's how he came and went.
00:52:17.217,00:52:18.677,There was no sign of forcible entry.
00:52:19.427,00:52:21.513,-No one heard a peep. -In a rooming house?
00:52:21.596,00:52:27.269,"My assumption is, he held a knife to the boy to keep her quiet, and vice versa."
00:52:27.352,00:52:29.729,This falls clearly into the category of lust murder.
00:52:29.813,00:52:31.523,By that I mean it's sexually motivated.
00:52:31.606,00:52:34.067,That cannot be about horny.
00:52:34.151,00:52:37.904,It's more about sexual gratification through the annihilation of another.
00:52:38.238,00:52:40.991,-Did you find semen? -Found some on a throw cushion.
00:52:41.074,00:52:44.077,It was blood type O. I know that's not much help.
00:52:46.788,00:52:49.082,-He didn't rape them. -He could have problems with sex.
00:52:49.165,00:52:50.417,That'd be a good bet.
00:52:50.500,00:52:52.127,Could narrow things with your suspects.
00:52:52.210,00:52:53.753,I don't have suspects.
00:52:53.837,00:52:58.675,"I don't have fingerprints, shoe prints, not so much as a single hair."
00:52:59.342,00:53:00.176,Well...
00:53:00.260,00:53:02.721,The fact that the killer left nothing behind is interesting.
00:53:02.804,00:53:04.848,It must have been premeditated to a degree.
00:53:04.931,00:53:08.101,"He had gloves, he cleaned up after himself."
00:53:08.184,00:53:09.728,You think he was stalking her?
00:53:09.811,00:53:12.397,-Or she just caught his eye. -What about the boy?
00:53:13.023,00:53:14.024,He was a witness.
00:53:14.107,00:53:16.526,There are more expedient ways to get rid of a witness.
00:53:16.610,00:53:18.862,-Why make the boy watch? -And why sodomize him?
00:53:20.655,00:53:23.783,Is this crime about the woman or about the child?
00:53:27.120,00:53:30.040,-You're asking me? -I was just posing questions.
00:53:31.333,00:53:32.751,I get that.
00:53:32.834,00:53:34.502,-The broomstick. -Yeah?
00:53:34.586,00:53:37.505,Is it the same broomstick she used to sweep the church steps?
00:53:37.589,00:53:44.012,"-What if it is? -He might not be a congregant, maybe someone just passing through, but the church could be significant."
00:53:44.095,00:53:45.013,Could be?
00:53:48.308,00:53:52.145,I think that there's a passage in Mark.
00:53:52.228,00:53:54.648,Something about the Son of Man.
00:53:55.482,00:53:56.900,I don't follow.
00:53:59.527,00:54:00.528,What?
00:54:02.155,00:54:03.198,I don't know.
00:54:03.281,00:54:05.241,It's hard to tell from just the photos.
00:54:08.328,00:54:14.501,"This woman was devoted to her child, tried hard, and some stranger came along and..."
00:54:16.169,00:54:19.422,"Come on, Agent Ford, you got fancy methods."
00:54:19.506,00:54:23.843,What does a broomstick in the ass of a dirt poor single mom mean?
00:54:29.391,00:54:30.558,I don't know.
00:54:31.267,00:54:32.435,You're kidding me.
00:54:32.519,00:54:33.687,I don't understand it.
00:54:34.771,00:54:37.941,-We can't help you with this. -We need more time to go over this.
00:54:38.024,00:54:42.028,We are in the dark here. We don't know any more than you do.
00:54:44.030,00:54:45.865,How fucking dare you?
00:54:46.700,00:54:48.368,I'm sorry we wasted your time.
00:55:33.830,00:55:35.665,"-In the dark, huh? -We are."
00:55:35.749,00:55:43.715,"I have studied everything we have. I've taken this ride here, listened to everything you've been kind enough to teach, but we're talking about something we don't understand in the slightest."
00:55:43.798,00:55:44.883,I was trying to help you.
00:55:44.966,00:55:48.428,"If you don't like it, go back to your college kids and we'll forget about it."
00:55:48.511,00:55:52.182,Ada and her son were killed for reasons we are simply not equipped to understand.
00:55:52.265,00:55:53.767,It wasn't lust murder.
00:55:53.850,00:55:59.439,"It wasn't some random thrill killer who was born bad, and it wasn't a pantie thief who wanted to change things up."
00:55:59.522,00:56:00.815,It was an aberration.
00:56:00.899,00:56:02.901,Let me tell you something about aberrant behavior.
00:56:02.984,00:56:04.235,It's fucking aberrant.
00:56:04.319,00:56:06.780,"If we understood it, we'd be aberrant too."
00:56:06.863,00:56:09.532,"Fortunately, it's not incumbent upon us to write a dissertation."
00:56:09.616,00:56:11.159,"-Well, maybe we should. -Why?"
00:56:12.243,00:56:15.830,Our job is to give him something he could not have figured out himself.
00:56:15.914,00:56:18.541,-I am sticking my neck out for you. -No disrespect.
00:56:18.625,00:56:22.295,"At the moment, I don't think we can say anything to McGraw with any certainty."
00:56:22.378,00:56:24.506,Let me ask you something. Where are you from?
00:56:26.633,00:56:29.511,"I was born in New York, but it's kind of a mixed bag."
00:56:29.594,00:56:32.722,"Okay. Well, that's what you are right now, a mixed bag."
00:56:33.223,00:56:38.061,"A little college education, some experience on the street, some insight, a lot of horseshit."
00:56:38.144,00:56:39.687,I agree with you.
00:56:39.771,00:56:42.107,"It's been one step forward, two steps back."
00:56:42.190,00:56:44.567,Let me ask you something else. Do you have a girlfriend?
00:56:45.527,00:56:47.987,"-I do now, Bill, as it happens. -Okay."
00:56:48.071,00:56:55.703,"So next time you're a long way from home and you flip your shit, you find a pay phone and you tell it to your girlfriend."
00:56:56.454,00:56:57.539,-Okay? -Okay.
00:56:57.622,00:57:00.500,"-How's that sound? -It sounds okay, Bill."
00:00:21.604,00:00:22.647,May I help you?
00:00:25.233,00:00:27.235,I need some replacement electrical tape.
00:00:27.569,00:00:30.280,Okay. You bring me the empty and I'll get you a new roll.
00:00:32.198,00:00:35.035,The cardboard core that's left when you run out of tape.
00:00:36.077,00:00:37.412,What? Why?
00:00:38.204,00:00:39.622,That's the way we do it.
00:00:40.457,00:00:43.376,I can't give you a new one until we get the old.
00:00:43.460,00:00:44.377,Are you kidding me?
00:00:46.296,00:00:47.130,No.
00:02:43.746,00:02:46.833,"Just, hey, do me a favor. Don't mention this to me ever again."
00:02:46.916,00:02:49.586,-I'm going to. -It's the insanest idea I've ever heard.
00:02:49.669,00:02:51.629,"-I'm going to, Bill. -We have a job to do."
00:02:51.713,00:03:03.433,"-We are here to teach. -Chino, California Medical, California Men's Colony, Norco, Soledad, San Quentin-- If you'd said to me, I want to become a Beach Boy, take up surfing, -sit around smoking the vibes. -Folsom."
00:03:03.516,00:03:05.226,"Or, I want to make it in the movies."
00:03:05.310,00:03:07.729,Gonna get me a walk-up in West Hollywood and a Pekingese.
00:03:10.523,00:03:12.108,"A hop, skip, and a jump."
00:03:12.483,00:03:14.819,-You really wanna meet Charlie Manson? -Why not?
00:03:16.779,00:03:17.697,Yeah.
00:03:18.615,00:03:19.532,Thank you.
00:03:21.409,00:03:23.953,Nobody wants to hear about that crazy motherfucker.
00:03:24.037,00:03:25.121,You know this.
00:03:28.208,00:03:31.878,"Besides, when are you gonna find time for these fireside chats, Holden?"
00:03:34.297,00:03:35.340,I'll figure it out.
00:03:41.095,00:03:43.806,Tom Snyder's been trying to interview him for years.
00:03:43.890,00:03:46.142,We're the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
00:03:46.226,00:03:48.436,What if his civil rights are being violated?
00:04:15.964,00:04:18.675,That's more unsolved murders than in any other state.
00:04:18.758,00:04:20.510,It's partly due to geography.
00:04:20.593,00:04:29.852,"In the woods, in the mountains, -ravines, hiking trails-- -You can't get to Manson, CMF treats him like a fucking unicorn."
00:04:29.936,00:04:33.273,No one needs to think about psychology more than the people in Santa Cruz.
00:04:34.148,00:04:37.986,"-In a homicide situation... -If you go to Vacaville, meet Ed Kemper."
00:04:42.031,00:04:45.535,Kemper. Ed Kemper. They call him the Coed Killer.
00:04:49.080,00:04:51.833,"You can't miss the guy. He's like six foot nine, 285 pounds."
00:04:51.916,00:04:53.501,-Whoa. King-size. -Super king.
00:04:57.380,00:05:00.550,"Six teenage girls, chops their heads off, has sexual intercourse with the corpses."
00:05:00.633,00:05:04.804,"-Oh... -Kills his mom with a claw hammer, has sexual intercourse with her head."
00:05:04.887,00:05:06.931,-Bullshit. -In her mouth.
00:05:07.307,00:05:08.474,-No. -Yeah.
00:05:11.728,00:05:14.647,He was in a mental institution right up until then too.
00:05:14.731,00:05:21.446,"He's a total whack job. He was murdering his grandparents at the age of 15, but then he manages to convince everyone that he's completely rehabilitated."
00:05:21.529,00:05:22.405,"Oh, my God."
00:05:22.488,00:05:25.616,"In many of these crimes, the motives are not just obscure..."
00:05:25.700,00:05:28.703,Jim Conor knew him real well. I'll introduce you.
00:05:28.786,00:05:30.121,-Really? -Yeah.
00:05:30.204,00:05:32.832,-...borderline unfathomable. -Thank you.
00:05:36.961,00:05:40.715,"-Was he an informant? -No, but he was smart. He was funny."
00:05:41.257,00:05:45.261,He used to watch all the cop shows on TV. Crazy about Wambaugh and Police Story.
00:05:47.847,00:05:51.934,He would joke that they could conceal his psychiatric record but not his fat ass.
00:05:55.354,00:05:57.648,Guys like him always want to be in uniform.
00:05:57.732,00:06:00.151,Losers. Losers are drawn to authority.
00:06:00.234,00:06:02.570,"Nobody wants to admit it, but losers are useful."
00:06:04.614,00:06:08.284,"They know what everybody else is up to. And they're resentful, a lot of 'em."
00:06:08.367,00:06:10.703,-They always got a raw deal. -Ed was a busybody.
00:06:11.287,00:06:13.206,And this was before you knew about the killings?
00:06:13.289,00:06:16.042,"Oh, we knew about 'em, just hadn't connected them with him."
00:06:16.125,00:06:19.170,"-He kept asking about them, though. -And you didn't suspect him?"
00:06:22.965,00:06:25.051,What? You liked the guy.
00:06:26.469,00:06:29.764,"-Let's say he was a friendly nuisance. -Oh, come on."
00:06:29.847,00:06:32.600,-He was hard not to like. -So you were the arresting officer?
00:06:32.683,00:06:37.939,"In the end, he lit out to Pueblo, Colorado, expecting there to be some kind of manhunt."
00:06:38.439,00:06:42.360,"When nobody came, he got sick of waiting and decided to turn himself in."
00:06:43.027,00:06:45.488,Called from a pay phone. Confessed!
00:06:46.197,00:06:49.283,We thought he was bullshitting. I drove him all the way back.
00:06:49.367,00:06:53.287,He wouldn't stop yakking. Going into forensic detail.
00:06:53.371,00:06:54.872,I thought I hit the jackpot.
00:06:54.956,00:06:58.292,"After a few hours, I'm like, Oh, God, please. Enough!"
00:06:58.376,00:07:00.086,You think Kemper would talk to us?
00:07:00.878,00:07:02.421,Try stopping him.
00:07:02.505,00:07:03.673,"Who's us, kemosabe?"
00:07:10.263,00:07:13.850,Spent his days sorting letters at the post office so he could...
00:07:13.933,00:07:14.767,What?
00:07:15.351,00:07:17.019,"Really, what are you expecting to learn?"
00:07:17.603,00:07:19.981,A killer who can't stop talking? It's a gift.
00:07:20.064,00:07:21.023,"A gift, huh?"
00:07:21.691,00:07:23.901,He made a severed head perform fellatio on him.
00:07:24.610,00:07:27.363,"His third victim was a 15-year-old child, Holden."
00:07:29.490,00:07:30.491,You don't want to talk?
00:07:30.575,00:07:33.536,"So, basically, you just got me out here to carry your slide projector?"
00:07:33.619,00:07:36.706,"To help with the workload, yeah. The work we're sanctioned to do."
00:07:36.789,00:07:39.792,Kemper doesn't interest you or is beneath you somehow?
00:07:39.876,00:07:40.960,A little of both.
00:07:44.839,00:07:45.923,What about the suit?
00:07:46.007,00:07:48.634,"Anybody finds out you're a fed, there'll be a riot."
00:07:48.801,00:07:52.847,"Shepard finds out you've been interviewing the Coed Killer as a side project, he'll flip his shit."
00:07:52.930,00:07:55.475,It's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.
00:07:59.145,00:08:05.776,"If you're gonna go in, you need to go in stone goddamn cold, take him by surprise, get the fuck out as quick as possible."
00:08:05.860,00:08:06.694,Good advice.
00:08:06.777,00:08:10.573,"Straight in there, don't phone, don't give them a chance to ask around."
00:08:10.656,00:08:11.741,I'm a buddy of Jim Conor's.
00:08:12.325,00:08:15.661,"Jim Conor reached out, you bet. He sends his regards."
00:08:15.745,00:08:17.914,I stopped by the Jury Room for a drink.
00:08:17.997,00:08:20.583,"The guys all say... Blah, blah, blah."
00:08:20.666,00:08:23.294,-Can I call you Big Ed? -I wouldn't mention the killings.
00:08:23.377,00:08:25.546,You're not there because he's a necrophile degenerate.
00:08:25.630,00:08:27.965,You're there because he's... fascinating.
00:08:28.049,00:08:29.759,How do I not mention the killings?
00:08:30.384,00:08:31.427,Just take it slow.
00:08:33.346,00:08:35.806,-What are you doing? -Just in case.
00:08:35.890,00:08:37.850,They're not gonna let you in with a sidearm.
00:08:37.934,00:08:40.770,"The guy is six foot nine, weighs 300 pounds."
00:08:40.853,00:08:42.939,-That's right. -So what's he gonna do?
00:08:43.022,00:08:47.902,"He's gonna take the fucking thing away, kill you with it, and then have sex with your face."
00:09:03.334,00:09:04.377,"Hold it, guys."
00:09:13.928,00:09:15.846,You could come. Take notes.
00:09:15.930,00:09:18.182,"You take notes, I'll help you write 'em up."
00:09:18.266,00:09:22.937,You're really gonna go golfing while I glean profound insights from the Coed Killer?
00:09:23.020,00:09:24.981,-It's my day off. -You're gonna be sorry.
00:09:25.064,00:09:29.527,"No. You're gonna be sorry, Holden, when he decides you're using him and there's nothing in it for good old Ed."
00:09:29.610,00:09:30.987,-I think there is. -What?
00:09:31.529,00:09:34.949,He's going to be part of something instead of rotting inside a cell.
00:09:35.032,00:09:37.368,Part of what? We're not even here.
00:09:40.246,00:09:41.080,All right.
00:09:53.217,00:09:54.468,"Yes, sir."
00:10:02.184,00:10:04.562,"In addition, I have some paperwork for you to sign."
00:11:45.496,00:11:49.500,"Can we unlock the-- No, those stay on. They're regulation."
00:11:50.668,00:11:53.003,I think that's gonna be a little awkward.
00:11:54.964,00:11:56.132,You're FBI.
00:12:03.806,00:12:06.392,"-Okay. You're all set. -Thanks, Jim."
00:12:16.485,00:12:17.570,"Holden, right?"
00:12:20.406,00:12:22.283,-Edward. -Edmund.
00:12:22.366,00:12:24.869,"-Oh, I'm sorry. I assumed that it was-- -Are you tired?"
00:12:24.952,00:12:26.287,How could you tell?
00:12:26.370,00:12:28.831,"It's a beautiful drive, but it's long."
00:12:30.499,00:12:33.335,"Edmund was my mom's idea, so you can call me Ed."
00:12:36.589,00:12:37.631,Sure thing.
00:12:39.842,00:12:41.343,So how can I help?
00:12:42.928,00:12:44.763,Okay. Um...
00:12:53.063,00:12:55.483,Can I get you something? You want a sandwich?
00:12:56.066,00:12:58.861,"-No, I'm okay. -What kind of sandwich you like?"
00:13:00.154,00:13:04.200,-Um... I'm good. -You want an egg salad sandwich?
00:13:04.700,00:13:08.120,-I'm fine. Really. -I'll get us an egg salad sandwich.
00:13:08.204,00:13:10.915,I can get almost anything you want from the canteen.
00:13:16.212,00:13:17.213,Okay.
00:13:18.756,00:13:21.383,"-Do you have tuna? -Oh, the egg salad's better."
00:13:31.519,00:13:33.521,"-Good, huh? -Mmm!"
00:13:34.063,00:13:35.397,These guys are great.
00:13:35.481,00:13:38.776,I've been here five years. We just clicked right off the bat.
00:13:40.110,00:13:41.320,You like the guards?
00:13:42.488,00:13:44.156,"Well, they like me. I'm polite."
00:13:44.782,00:13:49.870,"You know, I heard that you used to drink at the Jury Room."
00:13:50.412,00:13:52.164,You mean in Santa Cruz?
00:13:52.665,00:13:54.917,"Yeah, those are good guys."
00:13:55.834,00:13:58.587,I applied to California Highway Patrol.
00:13:58.671,00:14:03.175,My mom spoke to the cops to get my psychiatric record expunged.
00:14:03.259,00:14:07.429,"Turns out my record didn't bother them at all, I was just too tall."
00:14:13.936,00:14:14.937,What?
00:14:15.020,00:14:16.897,Nothing. It just seems...
00:14:16.981,00:14:18.566,You think they lied to me?
00:14:20.651,00:14:21.485,No.
00:14:22.945,00:14:26.115,"Well, cops like me because they can talk to me..."
00:14:27.032,00:14:29.952,"more than they can talk to their own wives, some of them."
00:14:30.035,00:14:31.579,Really? What do you talk about?
00:14:32.121,00:14:33.581,"You know, books, movies."
00:14:33.664,00:14:36.584,I watch all the cop shows on TV.
00:14:36.667,00:14:37.793,"Do you know, uh..."
00:14:39.211,00:14:42.131,"Joseph Wambaugh, Police Story? You ever watch that?"
00:14:43.549,00:14:46.552,I got a lot of my insights right there.
00:14:46.635,00:14:47.511,Really?
00:14:48.888,00:14:50.180,What kind of insights?
00:14:50.264,00:14:58.689,"Well, so, for example, with cops, I would not allow myself to walk into a trap because I knew exactly how their minds worked from watching Wambaugh."
00:14:58.772,00:15:00.524,What kind of trap are you talking about?
00:15:00.608,00:15:02.985,The classic is talking too much about the crimes.
00:15:03.068,00:15:04.111,Over-interest.
00:15:04.653,00:15:06.488,You have to remain casual.
00:15:07.072,00:15:09.575,They tried everything to trick me. I'm too savvy.
00:15:09.658,00:15:11.619,"I don't fucking talk, period."
00:15:13.746,00:15:15.539,Really? That's interesting.
00:15:15.623,00:15:16.457,So...
00:15:18.000,00:15:19.543,you had this idea?
00:15:19.627,00:15:20.753,"Yes. Uh, yes."
00:15:23.047,00:15:24.173,"It's kind of, uh..."
00:15:27.509,00:15:30.012,"Well, it's more of a research thing."
00:15:30.095,00:15:31.096,Research.
00:15:31.764,00:15:35.100,"Just a series of interviews, chatting with..."
00:15:36.310,00:15:39.438,individuals not unlike yourself.
00:15:40.606,00:15:42.066,We're just talking?
00:15:43.233,00:15:45.945,"I don't get to go someplace, do a bunch of tests?"
00:15:46.028,00:15:48.238,"No. Yeah, no tests. Just right here."
00:15:48.781,00:15:49.615,Why?
00:15:50.199,00:15:52.493,"Well, because I believe it could be useful."
00:15:53.953,00:15:55.371,Talking about what?
00:15:55.913,00:15:57.206,"Well, I don't know."
00:15:59.291,00:16:00.209,Your...
00:16:01.293,00:16:03.379,"behavior, I guess."
00:16:05.381,00:16:06.632,"If you want to, that is."
00:16:06.715,00:16:10.386,We don't have to talk about anything at all if you don't want to.
00:16:11.845,00:16:13.722,Why are you so tense?
00:16:15.224,00:16:16.976,"You're tense, right now."
00:16:17.601,00:16:19.061,"No, I'm not tense."
00:16:21.397,00:16:24.108,"Well, I'll be honest, I don't get many visitors."
00:16:24.191,00:16:27.486,"When I do, you think they want to talk about this shit?"
00:16:28.028,00:16:33.033,"Fuck no. It's like if you worked at a slaughterhouse with livestock, real conversation stopper."
00:16:33.617,00:16:34.451,Did you?
00:16:34.535,00:16:36.328,"No, I'm just saying..."
00:16:37.079,00:16:42.751,"People who hunt other people for a vocation, all we want to talk about is what it's like."
00:16:43.252,00:16:46.255,The shit that went down. The entire fucked-upness of it.
00:16:47.297,00:16:48.465,"Right, sure."
00:16:49.466,00:16:52.094,It's not easy. Butchering people is hard work.
00:16:52.803,00:16:56.223,Physically and mentally. I don't think people realize.
00:16:56.306,00:16:57.599,You need to vent.
00:16:59.727,00:17:01.353,What are you writing down?
00:17:07.276,00:17:08.861,"Well, what would you call it?"
00:17:09.987,00:17:12.781,A hobby? I'd say it's more than that.
00:17:13.449,00:17:17.619,Look at the consequences. The stakes are very high.
00:17:21.582,00:17:24.043,Is this helping? Are you getting what you came for?
00:17:24.126,00:17:25.544,-I think. -Good.
00:17:25.627,00:17:27.546,Can I-- Could I just ask you something?
00:17:29.048,00:17:31.050,Do you believe that prison can help you?
00:17:31.633,00:17:32.634,Are you kidding?
00:17:33.177,00:17:35.637,You think you shouldn't be in prison?
00:17:35.721,00:17:39.683,"I think it's shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted, somewhat."
00:17:40.184,00:17:42.811,What do you think the state should do with you instead?
00:17:42.895,00:17:46.398,"Well, Holden, a lobotomy's not out of the question."
00:17:46.482,00:17:47.691,Lobotomy?
00:17:47.775,00:17:49.234,Like Frances Farmer.
00:17:49.735,00:17:52.279,-You remember Frances Farmer? -No.
00:17:52.362,00:17:54.782,I loved Frances Farmer. She was an actress.
00:17:55.199,00:17:57.034,They lobotomized her in the '50s.
00:17:57.117,00:18:02.748,She was very smart and intense... very misunderstood. She was a lot like me.
00:18:02.831,00:18:05.334,You don't think you could benefit from psychiatry?
00:18:05.626,00:18:08.629,I already did all that in the institution.
00:18:10.339,00:18:11.507,It didn't take.
00:18:12.925,00:18:16.011,"For me, I think surgery might give me the best chance."
00:18:16.095,00:18:24.686,"And if surgery doesn't... take, in this modern society, what do we do with the Ed Kempers of the world?"
00:18:25.312,00:18:27.106,"Well, isn't that your department?"
00:18:30.400,00:18:31.735,From your perspective.
00:18:37.324,00:18:38.700,Death by torture?
00:19:01.265,00:19:03.684,Why do you keep looking at me like that?
00:19:03.767,00:19:05.936,-Like what? -Funny.
00:19:06.019,00:19:08.981,You keep looking at me like I'm a specimen.
00:19:14.069,00:19:16.321,"It's just you seem like a nice, ordinary..."
00:19:17.614,00:19:21.160,It's difficult for me to square you with what you're in prison for.
00:19:22.452,00:19:23.370,Oh.
00:19:24.246,00:19:25.289,"Well, sure."
00:19:28.083,00:19:33.755,"I was a regular guy most of my life, with a nice home, nice suburb."
00:19:33.839,00:19:35.841,"I had pets, I went to a good school."
00:19:35.924,00:19:39.970,"I was a thoughtful, educated, well brought up young person."
00:19:40.053,00:19:41.805,There's no question about it.
00:19:42.681,00:19:43.515,But...
00:19:45.184,00:19:46.685,at the same time...
00:19:47.561,00:19:55.986,"I was living a vile, depraved, entirely parallel other life filled with debased violence and mayhem, and fear, and death."
00:19:56.069,00:19:57.029,Well...
00:19:57.821,00:20:02.618,it certainly seems to me like you had your own unusual...
00:20:03.994,00:20:06.038,"An unusual MO. Oh, sure."
00:20:06.121,00:20:08.582,"Well, I was gonna say..."
00:20:09.249,00:20:10.292,signature.
00:20:11.001,00:20:12.628,"An oeuvre, if you will."
00:20:13.253,00:20:14.755,You could study it.
00:20:16.924,00:20:19.134,"You can spell oeuvre, can't you, Holden?"
00:20:21.553,00:20:23.764,"You know, there's a lot more like me."
00:20:26.225,00:20:27.267,Do you think so?
00:20:28.185,00:20:29.895,People that kill in sequence like you did?
00:20:29.978,00:20:31.980,-Sequence? -One right after another.
00:20:32.522,00:20:33.607,At regular intervals.
00:20:33.690,00:20:35.234,I've just been calling them...
00:20:36.193,00:20:37.819,sequence killers...
00:20:38.654,00:20:39.655,if you will.
00:20:40.113,00:20:42.699,-How many would you say? -Well...
00:20:44.785,00:20:48.956,"it would be a guess, but I'd say right now..."
00:20:51.166,00:20:53.877,"North America, more than 35."
00:20:53.961,00:20:55.003,Thirty-five?
00:20:55.087,00:20:59.132,But you're never gonna find them if they don't want you to. Not even close.
00:21:00.467,00:21:01.802,That can't be right.
00:21:01.885,00:21:05.097,"Well, Holden, I'm not an expert. I'm not an authority."
00:21:05.681,00:21:12.646,I'm just an extremely accomplished murderer who spent my adult life successfully evading capture...
00:21:13.689,00:21:17.276,until I gave myself up because I despaired of ever being caught.
00:21:19.194,00:21:20.779,So take it or leave it.
00:21:22.239,00:21:23.490,What do you want from me?
00:21:26.743,00:21:28.036,I have no idea.
00:21:28.829,00:21:32.249,His oeuvre? What the fuck? He's Stanley Kubrick?
00:21:32.332,00:21:34.668,He was extremely talkative.
00:21:34.751,00:21:37.963,He likes talking to cops. He's lonely. He could do it all day.
00:21:38.046,00:21:40.549,"He's not some frenzied thrill killer, Bill."
00:21:41.383,00:21:42.926,I think we need to face that.
00:21:43.260,00:21:46.680,He chopped off women's heads and had sex with their corpses.
00:21:46.763,00:21:48.807,"If that's not frenzied, I don't know what is."
00:21:48.890,00:21:50.058,He is so articulate.
00:21:50.642,00:21:54.604,He's meticulous and highly intelligent.
00:21:54.688,00:21:59.401,"Yeah, he meticulously chose small, young, female prey who couldn't fight back."
00:21:59.901,00:22:01.028,Animal cunning.
00:22:01.111,00:22:04.197,He's self-aware and objective. Isn't that highly unusual?
00:22:04.281,00:22:08.285,"He's saying everything you want to hear, just like he did with the shrinks in the institution."
00:22:08.368,00:22:11.121,"He knew just enough to talk his way out, then went hunting."
00:22:11.204,00:22:14.082,-Don't be stupid about this. -What makes you so sure I'm being stupid?
00:22:14.166,00:22:15.500,I know these fuckers.
00:22:15.584,00:22:18.420,It's only a matter of time before he hits you up for privileges.
00:22:18.503,00:22:21.340,"-Next, he's complaining to the warden-- -Come with me next weekend."
00:22:21.423,00:22:24.801,"-See for yourself. -No, I'm not gonna do that."
00:22:24.885,00:22:26.470,You're just going to play golf?
00:22:27.304,00:22:30.223,It helps me think clearly. You might want to try it.
00:22:38.231,00:22:41.485,-Over a little. Left. -My left or your left?
00:22:41.568,00:22:42.611,My left.
00:22:45.822,00:22:46.698,This okay?
00:22:46.782,00:22:48.241,It's fine. What's wrong?
00:22:48.325,00:22:50.619,-You want a break? -Why would I want a break?
00:22:50.702,00:22:52.621,-That's not how it works. -All right.
00:22:52.871,00:22:56.124,You want me to throw in something? Play with your nipples?
00:22:56.208,00:22:57.959,-Why? -Move it along.
00:22:58.043,00:23:00.670,-You're doing great. Just stop stopping. -Okay.
00:23:03.840,00:23:07.511,He knows more about lust murder than the whole FBI Behavioral Science Unit.
00:23:07.594,00:23:10.514,-We should put him on the payroll. -Would the FBI ever do that?
00:23:10.597,00:23:11.640,Doubtful.
00:23:11.723,00:23:14.601,Everyone's freaked out that Berkowitz might sell his life story.
00:23:14.684,00:23:17.437,New York State is moving to make that sort of thing illegal.
00:23:17.521,00:23:19.606,It'd be awful for the families of the victims.
00:23:21.399,00:23:26.947,"Uh, can I get two eggs over medium, home-fried potatoes, and wheat toast with grape jelly?"
00:23:27.030,00:23:28.865,-And for you? -Uh...
00:23:28.949,00:23:31.660,-I'll just have an Ed salad sandwich-- -A what?
00:23:31.743,00:23:35.497,"-An egg salad sandwich. Thank you. -Holden, you don't even like egg salad."
00:23:38.416,00:23:40.001,I'll just have a Denver omelet.
00:23:41.419,00:23:44.548,You've got mention-itis. You cannot stop mentioning him.
00:23:44.631,00:23:47.426,Think of how much we can learn from a guy like Kemper.
00:23:48.176,00:23:50.095,He called it a vocation.
00:23:50.178,00:23:51.096,-Killing women? -Yeah.
00:23:51.179,00:23:53.890,Jesus. How do you wrap your mind around that?
00:23:54.975,00:23:56.434,Couldn't attract them.
00:23:56.518,00:23:58.186,Didn't have the social skills.
00:23:58.270,00:24:00.063,That would describe a lot of guys.
00:24:01.565,00:24:02.983,Why does he hate women?
00:24:03.483,00:24:04.818,I should ask.
00:24:04.901,00:24:07.612,-But not outright. -No?
00:24:07.696,00:24:10.991,He sounds like the kind of person who would tell you what you wanna hear.
00:24:11.074,00:24:13.785,"-You have to disarm him first. -You mean, like..."
00:24:14.911,00:24:17.747,-What? -Ask him questions about himself.
00:24:18.748,00:24:21.877,"Lean into him, listen intently."
00:24:21.960,00:24:24.713,-I do that. -Keep your arms uncrossed.
00:24:25.422,00:24:27.465,Mirror his movements.
00:24:28.300,00:24:31.178,Encourage him to talk about the things he's excited about.
00:24:31.261,00:24:33.180,Are these feminine wiles?
00:24:33.263,00:24:35.473,Cross your legs in his direction.
00:24:36.641,00:24:39.060,-Do you really do that? -But don't touch him.
00:24:39.936,00:24:44.649,"You want him to like you, but you don't want him to think you're gonna fuck him."
00:24:59.956,00:25:03.376,I spent five years as a brick agent and a couple of years at the academy.
00:25:07.380,00:25:09.424,"You're Melvin Purvis, G-MAN."
00:25:09.507,00:25:10.508,Exactly.
00:25:10.592,00:25:12.385,"And back then, no skirt in the FBI."
00:25:12.469,00:25:14.262,"-No women, just men. -Wow."
00:25:14.346,00:25:19.017,"Then I enroll in college, and suddenly, I am Warren fucking Beatty."
00:25:19.100,00:25:21.228,-Wow. -Everything goes.
00:25:21.311,00:25:22.771,-You take sugar? -No.
00:25:22.854,00:25:24.314,-Cool. Milk? -Thank you.
00:25:24.397,00:25:28.360,"-You got it, man. -Suddenly it's disco and poppers, and fern bars."
00:25:28.443,00:25:30.695,I am up to my neck in chicks.
00:25:30.779,00:25:32.405,"Pussy, pussy, pussy. I hear that."
00:25:32.489,00:25:36.534,It turns out chicks do really dig a guy with a badge.
00:25:36.618,00:25:39.162,"Gas, grass, or ass. Nobody rides for free."
00:25:39.246,00:25:42.249,"Next thing I know, I'm with a 24-year-old that I met in a bar."
00:25:42.332,00:25:45.835,No woman has ever been so into me in my entire life.
00:25:45.919,00:25:47.337,Don't brag. It's unbecoming.
00:25:47.420,00:25:49.339,"Oh, my God. I am so sorry."
00:25:49.422,00:25:50.548,I'm kidding.
00:25:54.469,00:25:56.846,the things she comes up with in the sack.
00:25:56.930,00:25:58.598,You gotta love that young pussy.
00:25:59.182,00:26:01.142,I do. I really fucking do.
00:26:01.226,00:26:05.814,You gotta make it with that young pussy real quick before it turns into Mom.
00:26:08.066,00:26:09.025,Yeah.
00:26:11.778,00:26:15.073,"So you were a virgin up until then, that's what you're saying?"
00:26:15.156,00:26:18.285,"-No, not at all. -Oh, you go over like you're a virgin."
00:26:19.160,00:26:20.870,-What? -What's wrong with that?
00:26:20.954,00:26:22.205,I was a virgin for years.
00:26:22.289,00:26:25.333,"Oh, no, there's nothing wrong with it, it's just I'm... not."
00:26:25.750,00:26:26.751,Uh-huh.
00:26:27.627,00:26:30.463,"This new girl, she take it up the ass?"
00:26:33.508,00:26:35.302,We haven't really discussed it.
00:26:35.385,00:26:36.594,Ask her.
00:26:36.678,00:26:39.973,"An asshole will suck your cock right in, literally."
00:26:40.056,00:26:41.683,It's like a hole that sucks.
00:26:44.269,00:26:47.731,"But when you fuck somebody in the neck, it's entirely the opposite."
00:26:47.814,00:26:51.651,It's nothing but resistance. It's really difficult.
00:26:51.735,00:26:52.944,Let me.
00:26:53.028,00:26:54.529,You feel this?
00:26:54.612,00:26:56.614,Feel it. It's all muscle.
00:26:56.698,00:26:58.325,Cartilaginous.
00:27:01.911,00:27:03.288,Is this interesting?
00:27:03.747,00:27:07.876,"-Oh, yeah. -Because I can skip some of the detail."
00:27:08.335,00:27:09.961,"No, I'm here for the detail."
00:27:11.129,00:27:12.797,A major college campus.
00:27:12.881,00:27:16.634,"It's like a giant candy store, you know what I mean."
00:27:16.718,00:27:17.636,Right.
00:27:18.303,00:27:23.933,"Your, uh, your mom worked on campus at UCSC, right?"
00:27:24.476,00:27:26.061,Remind me again what she did.
00:27:29.064,00:27:31.691,-Administrative assistant. -Right.
00:27:35.403,00:27:40.909,"That's all she lived for, man, her work and her precious coeds, whom she mothered relentlessly."
00:27:41.326,00:27:43.828,Do you think that she neglected you for them?
00:27:43.912,00:27:49.918,"Put it this way, she had a very violently outspoken position on men."
00:27:51.252,00:27:53.671,She had a failed marriage with my father.
00:27:53.755,00:27:55.924,"I looked a lot like him, so..."
00:27:56.007,00:27:57.509,You reminded her of him.
00:28:00.261,00:28:03.431,Do you think you developed a dislike for young women as a result?
00:28:04.015,00:28:12.857,"As far as she was concerned, I was never going to end up with one of those girls because I was a fuckup and an embarrassment."
00:28:12.941,00:28:15.026,-You were a failure in her eyes. -Look.
00:28:15.527,00:28:26.830,"My mother was a decent, upstanding, reasonable woman, but when it came to me, she had nothing but contempt, disappointment, and disdain."
00:28:28.873,00:28:30.291,That must've been awful.
00:28:31.626,00:28:33.002,"Well, here's the thing."
00:28:37.632,00:28:38.675,I'm listening.
00:28:42.137,00:28:46.141,Women are born with this little hole between their legs...
00:28:47.058,00:28:50.812,which every man on earth just wants to stick something into.
00:28:52.564,00:28:57.402,"And they're weaker than men, so they learn strategies."
00:28:57.485,00:29:03.575,"They deploy their minds and their sex, and they intuitively learn to humiliate."
00:29:06.161,00:29:08.037,Did your mother humiliate you?
00:29:14.043,00:29:15.003,Ed?
00:29:38.485,00:29:42.530,"He did not stab, and rape, and decapitate Mom because he was aroused."
00:29:42.614,00:29:44.449,He was conditioned to do it.
00:29:44.532,00:29:46.951,-Did he say that? -As good as.
00:29:47.035,00:29:48.203,It's schtick.
00:29:48.286,00:29:50.205,He learned the vernacular in the institution.
00:29:50.288,00:29:52.957,"-He's sophisticated enough to use it. -No, that's not my instinct."
00:29:53.041,00:29:56.294,Is it your instinct he was choosing words carefully or did he just spew it out?
00:29:56.377,00:29:57.212,Very carefully.
00:29:57.295,00:30:00.882,He's got you pegged. He's telling you what he's guessed you want to hear.
00:30:01.424,00:30:04.427,-But why would I want to hear that? -Because you're you.
00:30:04.511,00:30:11.226,"You told him about your university education, and your sassy girlfriend, and your sensitive character, and he tailored his bullshit to fit."
00:30:12.727,00:30:15.396,-Why did you tell him that stuff? -To loosen him up.
00:30:16.564,00:30:19.150,Why do you feel the need to tell him about your girlfriend?
00:30:19.234,00:30:20.652,Just to get him talking.
00:30:20.735,00:30:23.404,"Holden, he's had seven years in a correctional facility."
00:30:23.488,00:30:25.490,He's been practicing. Don't encourage him.
00:30:25.573,00:30:27.659,-I was trying to disarm him. -You're a federal agent.
00:30:27.742,00:30:30.495,Don't give him anything. He's your subject. Be objective.
00:30:30.578,00:30:33.331,-I've gotta trust my instincts on this. -There's that word again.
00:30:33.414,00:30:38.795,"So in Fairfield, Iowa you were in the Dark Ages, and now suddenly, you have all these unimpeachable instincts?"
00:30:39.254,00:30:40.547,"Well, it's been a process."
00:30:40.630,00:30:52.350,"Okay, look, there's no doubt whatever happened in there was a profound experience for you, but I need you to understand that whatever you think, there is a distinct possibility that he's manipulating you."
00:31:49.824,00:31:51.159,It's not my fault.
00:32:23.316,00:32:25.735,"Gentleman, I'm Detective Roy Carver."
00:32:25.818,00:32:29.364,"Listen, I was a little late for the presentation, but that was just great."
00:32:29.447,00:32:31.699,"-Well, thank you very much. -Glad to be of service."
00:32:31.783,00:32:34.702,"Listen, before you go, I was hoping I could ask you something."
00:32:34.786,00:32:36.913,I know you're not just here to teach.
00:32:40.917,00:32:44.253,"I was hoping I could get you to take a look at something a little, uh..."
00:32:44.337,00:32:45.254,unusual.
00:32:46.381,00:32:47.924,"Oh, sure thing."
00:32:52.804,00:32:55.348,"Her name's Rosemary Gonzales, 73 years old."
00:32:55.431,00:33:01.354,"Her husband died of cancer so she sold the family farm in Chico, moved to Sacramento to be closer to the grandkids."
00:33:02.981,00:33:07.527,"Two weeks ago, we find her beaten within an inch of her life in a doorway to her back porch."
00:33:07.986,00:33:09.070,She hasn't been robbed.
00:33:09.153,00:33:14.826,"She's been groped and assaulted but not penetrated, and the little dog's throat's been cut."
00:33:16.786,00:33:18.579,Was the dog killed because it was protecting her?
00:33:18.663,00:33:20.123,Or for some other reason?
00:33:20.206,00:33:22.333,That I don't know. But it's interesting.
00:33:22.417,00:33:23.626,Why didn't he stab her?
00:33:24.627,00:33:25.962,Didn't have the nerve?
00:33:26.045,00:33:29.632,I don't think some Latino with a shiv got scared of a little old lady.
00:33:29.716,00:33:32.468,Why do you say that? Why do you say Latino like that?
00:33:32.552,00:33:34.345,"That's the neighborhood, spics and blacks."
00:33:34.429,00:33:36.723,Did she identify anybody of that ethnicity?
00:33:36.806,00:33:40.018,No. She was hovering in and out of a coma for the past ten days.
00:33:40.101,00:33:43.271,"Now she's finally come around, she has no recollection whatsoever."
00:33:43.771,00:33:45.565,You think it's about a little dog?
00:33:45.648,00:33:48.234,Scottish Terriers can be loud. Their bark...
00:33:48.317,00:33:50.486,-Could be annoying. -Listen...
00:33:51.529,00:33:55.033,we need to know exactly how worried we need to be.
00:34:36.449,00:34:39.494,"Me, I don't cry. I'm tough."
00:34:40.244,00:34:43.247,But he was just like a baby.
00:34:48.628,00:34:50.129,What did I ever do?
00:34:51.464,00:34:53.466,Who would do such a thing?
00:34:55.051,00:34:56.886,I never hurt a soul.
00:34:57.720,00:34:59.597,I don't have any enemies.
00:35:00.598,00:35:02.350,I don't dress like a whore.
00:35:06.979,00:35:08.314,Let me ask you something.
00:35:09.148,00:35:11.025,Did your dog ever bite anyone?
00:35:11.400,00:35:12.485,Never.
00:35:12.568,00:35:15.738,Ever bother anyone by barking? Any complaints from neighbors?
00:35:21.160,00:35:24.413,"-Who cuts the grass, Rosie? -Who helps you take care of the yard?"
00:35:25.164,00:35:27.667,I have all sorts of help. Kids mostly.
00:35:27.750,00:35:28.668,Which kids?
00:35:31.379,00:35:33.214,It's a very close community.
00:35:33.297,00:35:36.134,And you didn't recognize your assailant? He wasn't familiar?
00:35:37.593,00:35:39.220,I just don't remember.
00:35:41.556,00:35:42.974,Do you have kids?
00:35:43.057,00:35:44.058,Two daughters.
00:35:46.435,00:35:49.355,The eldest is divorced. Dios mío.
00:35:50.231,00:35:52.441,The younger I don't see that often.
00:35:52.525,00:35:54.110,Can you remember anything else?
00:35:54.235,00:35:55.736,"Was he big, little?"
00:36:00.074,00:36:01.993,I remember moonlight.
00:36:03.744,00:36:04.787,And...
00:36:07.540,00:36:09.625,I do remember a smell.
00:36:10.918,00:36:12.170,What kind of smell?
00:36:18.885,00:36:21.053,"Grease or gasoline, fertilizer?"
00:36:22.305,00:36:24.599,Like somebody who needed to wash.
00:36:25.224,00:36:33.733,"Seventeen, eighteen-year-old high school kid, low self-esteem, hates authority, doesn't get along well with his parents."
00:36:34.192,00:36:35.735,"What, just some punk?"
00:36:35.818,00:36:46.204,"Gets into a fight with his old man one night, maybe he gets a hold of a bottle of liquor and comes across the house, recognizes the place because he cut the grass there when he was younger."
00:36:48.956,00:36:52.376,"She doesn't recognize him, thinks he's broken in, and starts yelling."
00:36:52.835,00:36:54.378,The fight gets physical.
00:36:54.462,00:36:57.423,"He's drunk, he beats the shit out of her."
00:36:58.216,00:37:02.470,He knifes the dog because the dog is yapping its head off.
00:37:03.179,00:37:04.305,And then he runs.
00:37:05.264,00:37:07.975,Are you guys serious? A teenager?
00:37:08.059,00:37:09.227,He has bad hygiene.
00:37:13.231,00:37:16.067,"Look, we got a lot of kids like that around here."
00:37:17.652,00:37:20.488,But what kind of degenerate carves up a little dog?
00:37:20.571,00:37:26.577,"Maybe the kid saw the dog in the yard, decided to conduct a moonlight experiment with his Bowie knife, gets interrupted."
00:37:27.495,00:37:30.206,"A careful, considerate old lady would bring her dog in at night."
00:37:30.289,00:37:33.668,She went outside with the dog because she heard something.
00:37:35.628,00:37:37.213,It was a harvest moon.
00:37:38.714,00:37:42.134,"We have been tossing the idea around that maybe it's one of these, uh..."
00:37:42.385,00:37:44.220,"you know, satanic deals."
00:37:44.303,00:37:47.265,"You know, like maybe the dog is some kind of ritual sacrifice or something."
00:37:49.141,00:37:50.059,Check.
00:37:53.604,00:37:55.648,You need to squeeze the neighborhood kids.
00:37:55.731,00:37:56.941,One of them knows something.
00:37:57.024,00:37:59.652,"We had a kid like that, brought him in for questioning twice."
00:37:59.735,00:38:00.778,Bring him in again.
00:38:00.861,00:38:02.488,We're gonna get pushback from the family.
00:38:02.571,00:38:04.156,His aunt works for the county.
00:38:04.240,00:38:07.201,-Then make it formal. -I'm probably gonna need a warrant.
00:38:07.285,00:38:09.203,We might be able to help you with that.
00:38:16.335,00:38:17.295,Fuck!
00:38:19.797,00:38:23.175,Nancy's gonna kill me. We can't get a flight till Sunday.
00:38:27.013,00:38:29.640,-Maybe this kid's like Kemper. -We have to get a room.
00:38:29.724,00:38:32.810,I can take care of the room. We can turn this into an opportunity.
00:38:32.893,00:38:36.105,-It could help with the Gonzales case. -I can't believe I'm stuck with you.
00:38:36.188,00:38:38.065,-We can talk to Kemper. -No!
00:38:38.149,00:38:40.192,-I'm gonna play golf. -Come with me.
00:38:40.276,00:38:42.236,I'm not consulting with Ed Kemper.
00:38:42.320,00:38:44.655,Not to consult. Just background.
00:38:44.739,00:38:46.282,When did his behavior escalate?
00:38:46.365,00:38:48.409,"You can't stay away from that motherfucker, can you?"
00:38:48.492,00:38:50.536,"No, please. Don't say motherfucker."
00:38:51.120,00:38:53.414,You know that he'll respond to your seniority.
00:38:53.497,00:38:56.167,"-You could really smoke him out. -No, not now."
00:38:56.792,00:38:59.712,We're stuck here all weekend. What else are you gonna do?
00:39:01.088,00:39:02.673,"I said forget about it, man."
00:39:14.518,00:39:18.314,"So, you're the big boss, right?"
00:39:18.397,00:39:23.778,"Well, I established the Behavioral Science Unit years ago, but Holden's come in with a lot of new ideas."
00:39:23.861,00:39:27.323,So Holden's the intrepid rookie investigator?
00:39:27.406,00:39:30.326,Bill taught me everything I know about criminal behavior.
00:39:30.409,00:39:33.287,"Is that right? Well, let me ask you something, Bill."
00:39:33.371,00:39:35.998,What do you think about Joseph Wambaugh?
00:39:36.082,00:39:38.751,"He knows Joe. Right, Bill?"
00:39:39.502,00:39:40.419,Well...
00:39:40.503,00:39:43.214,"Actually, he based a lot of that stuff on Bill."
00:39:44.840,00:39:46.842,-No shit. -Uh-huh.
00:39:49.387,00:39:52.598,but the psychological insights and the vernacular.
00:39:52.681,00:39:53.557,Yeah.
00:39:54.058,00:39:55.768,That is fascinating.
00:39:56.268,00:39:59.021,I sure would love to pick your brain sometime.
00:39:59.105,00:40:00.981,"Well, that's another life sentence right there."
00:40:03.401,00:40:06.070,talk about your background a little bit with Bill.
00:40:06.654,00:40:11.659,Maybe tell him the thing that you told me the other day about your mother.
00:40:13.953,00:40:15.162,My mother.
00:40:18.290,00:40:24.922,"Well, you see, Bill, even as a child, I had kind of a rich fantasy life."
00:40:25.840,00:40:30.094,"As a teenager, I began by cutting up inanimate objects."
00:40:30.177,00:40:32.304,G.I. Joe. My sister's dolls.
00:40:32.388,00:40:35.266,"Ripping their heads off, cutting up the bodies."
00:40:35.766,00:40:37.768,"Mutilating them, if you will."
00:40:37.852,00:40:40.604,"You had fantasies of what, real women?"
00:40:41.814,00:40:45.860,"And my mother would yell and scream at me, tell me I was sick."
00:40:45.943,00:40:48.946,She thought I was going to do something hideous one day.
00:40:49.029,00:40:50.656,What did she think you were gonna do?
00:40:50.739,00:40:54.160,I guess rape my sister or something.
00:40:54.618,00:40:56.871,This is when I was ten years old.
00:40:58.122,00:40:58.956,Nice.
00:40:59.457,00:41:01.417,Not exactly The Brady Bunch.
00:41:03.210,00:41:05.045,Because she was fucking nuts.
00:41:08.424,00:41:12.094,She'd make me sleep on a dirty old mattress in the basement.
00:41:12.178,00:41:14.889,Lock the door. Ten years old.
00:41:14.972,00:41:19.894,"So then it became dogs and cats, strangling them, burying them in the backyard."
00:41:25.232,00:41:26.567,Just to vent.
00:41:27.735,00:41:31.405,You know what I'm saying? Classic displacement activity.
00:41:31.489,00:41:35.784,Because it was my retreat from the insanity of the world.
00:41:38.037,00:41:39.038,"Sorry, guys."
00:41:43.751,00:41:45.294,Is that why your mother sent you away?
00:41:46.545,00:41:51.050,"In the end, I ran away to live with my father, but he didn't want me either."
00:41:51.133,00:41:54.595,So they packed me off to live with my grandma.
00:41:54.678,00:41:56.555,She thought I was a freak.
00:41:56.639,00:41:57.890,Is that why you shot her?
00:41:58.432,00:42:02.186,"Well, they were both very controlling, aggressive, matriarchal women."
00:42:04.772,00:42:06.732,Get that down. That's a big antecedent.
00:42:07.233,00:42:08.275,What happened after that?
00:42:09.151,00:42:11.362,I was put in a fucking mental institution.
00:42:11.987,00:42:13.072,I was 15.
00:42:13.155,00:42:15.991,I was 21 years old when I came out.
00:42:16.075,00:42:21.747,"All those years when other kids were having their sexual revolution, I was locked in a room."
00:42:22.373,00:42:26.919,"You remember the whole flower power, college girls into love and peace?"
00:42:28.337,00:42:33.050,"Physically, I wasn't impotent, but emotionally I was."
00:42:34.468,00:42:39.056,"Because of the way I was conditioned by Mom, right? Like you said."
00:42:39.139,00:42:40.891,-Conditioned? -Right.
00:42:42.059,00:42:47.231,"You see, Bill, I knew a week before she died I was gonna kill her."
00:42:49.900,00:42:54.738,"She went out to a party, she got soused, she came home alone."
00:42:54.822,00:42:58.158,I asked her how her evening went. She just looked at me.
00:42:59.410,00:43:01.662,"She said, For seven years."
00:43:02.288,00:43:07.167,"She said, I haven't had sex with a man because of you, my murderous son."
00:43:12.464,00:43:15.426,So I got a claw hammer and I beat her to death.
00:43:17.177,00:43:18.512,Then I cut her head off.
00:43:23.475,00:43:25.352,And I humiliated her.
00:43:29.898,00:43:32.651,"And I said, There. Now you've had sex."
00:43:37.740,00:43:44.788,"If there's one thing I know, it's this: A mother should not scorn her own son."
00:43:45.956,00:43:52.588,"If a woman humiliates her little boy, he will become hostile, and violent, and debased. Period."
00:44:07.102,00:44:09.647,-I think we need to talk. -Now do you see?
00:44:09.730,00:44:11.940,I need to speak to Shepard. Tell him what's going on.
00:44:12.024,00:44:12.941,It's too early.
00:44:13.025,00:44:15.027,"The longer we wait, the worse it's gonna be."
00:44:15.110,00:44:18.113,-We'll be drowned in red tape. -And there's a reason for that.
00:44:18.197,00:44:21.367,"The FBI is a glacial bureaucracy, but it's highly effective."
00:44:21.450,00:44:23.911,"Kemper's in lockdown, what's he gonna do?"
00:44:23.994,00:44:26.246,Kemper is a gigantic blabbermouth.
00:44:26.330,00:44:28.123,He's friends with all the prison guards.
00:44:28.207,00:44:31.377,"A federal agent is meeting with him, you think that hasn't reached the warden?"
00:44:32.920,00:44:35.339,"A couple of months, that's all I need."
00:44:35.422,00:44:40.469,"No. Because if we get censured, we're off work two weeks minimum, no appeal."
00:44:40.552,00:44:42.930,And you can kiss goodbye to the Gonzales case.
00:44:43.013,00:44:44.640,They'll never catch that guy.
00:44:50.312,00:44:55.651,Did you tell a detective in Sacramento you would intercede with the district attorney on behalf of the FBI?
00:44:56.235,00:44:59.279,Some DA called me and asked why I had two agents in Sacramento.
00:44:59.363,00:45:01.573,"Two goons, his exact words."
00:45:01.657,00:45:02.908,It's a strange case.
00:45:02.991,00:45:05.702,The locals were struggling. We were trying to figure a way forward.
00:45:05.786,00:45:07.246,What were you thinking?
00:45:07.329,00:45:09.164,"At the time, we deemed this of great urgency."
00:45:09.248,00:45:10.582,The circumstances were unusual.
00:45:10.666,00:45:13.585,Assault and battery? Since when does the FBI consult on that?
00:45:13.669,00:45:14.711,Not even homicide.
00:45:14.795,00:45:16.130,Unless you count a dog.
00:45:16.672,00:45:20.634,"Bill, the past three years I've heard you complain about how overworked you are with the Road School."
00:45:20.717,00:45:24.304,"I gave you your assistant, and this is how you choose to spend your time?"
00:45:25.681,00:45:28.225,I trust you understand my position on this.
00:45:29.852,00:45:32.396,Is there anything else you want to tell me?
00:45:41.447,00:45:44.533,"I get back on Tuesday, if you want to pick me up from the airport."
00:45:44.616,00:45:45.742,"Sure, I'd love to."
00:45:46.743,00:45:49.580,-You should come with me sometime. -To Detroit?
00:45:50.497,00:45:53.333,See your old stomping grounds. Meet my mom.
00:45:55.085,00:45:56.420,"Okay, good to know where we're at."
00:45:56.503,00:45:59.506,"-No, I would love to meet your mom. -I said sometime."
00:45:59.590,00:46:01.758,"No, actually, it's something I would really enjoy."
00:46:01.842,00:46:03.427,I meant eventually.
00:46:03.510,00:46:05.846,"I'm sure she's really, really lovely."
00:46:06.430,00:46:11.310,"Actually, she's kind of a bitch, especially when it comes to people I'm dating."
00:46:11.393,00:46:12.227,Really?
00:46:12.936,00:46:14.855,But... I like you.
00:46:15.939,00:46:18.358,I might give you the secret to win her over.
00:46:20.527,00:46:21.528,What might that be?
00:46:21.612,00:46:26.950,"Well, Mom doesn't care what kind of music you like, what kind of job you have, what kind of car you drive."
00:46:27.576,00:46:30.954,"Instead, she'll ask you about your mother."
00:46:31.580,00:46:36.210,"It'll seem like a perfectly innocent question, but she'll be watching you closely."
00:46:37.211,00:46:43.258,"If she thinks you love and respect your mom, she'll know that you'll treat her daughter the same way."
00:46:46.053,00:46:47.387,That's actually shrewd.
00:46:48.055,00:46:50.724,...hair group. It can't do anything about the hair...
00:46:50.807,00:46:51.934,So...
00:46:53.018,00:46:54.269,do you like your mom?
00:46:56.813,00:46:57.856,I do.
00:46:57.940,00:47:00.400,She's someone I really enjoy talking to.
00:47:00.984,00:47:03.862,I knew it. I knew you were a momma's boy.
00:47:06.240,00:47:09.368,You should just come with me tomorrow. You've already passed the test.
00:47:09.826,00:47:11.495,I couldn't even if I wanted to.
00:47:12.079,00:47:14.164,Shepard doesn't want us leaving town.
00:47:14.248,00:47:15.666,Why? What's happened?
00:47:16.166,00:47:17.459,We-- Well...
00:47:18.085,00:47:19.002,I...
00:47:19.753,00:47:21.255,really fucked up.
00:47:21.839,00:47:23.632,Ooh. You grounded?
00:47:28.095,00:47:30.806,When are they gonna start taking this whole thing seriously?
00:48:00.752,00:48:02.421,-Hi. -Hi.
00:48:12.014,00:48:15.517,-How do you know where I live? -Personnel gave me your address.
00:48:25.902,00:48:27.154,Let's go back to Shepard.
00:48:27.863,00:48:29.948,"Tell him about Kemper, tell him what we've been doing."
00:48:30.032,00:48:32.743,-You think he'll listen now? -Let's make it official.
00:48:32.826,00:48:35.078,You don't want to wait till Sacramento blows over?
00:48:35.162,00:48:37.664,"No, I want to go back to Sacramento and fix it."
00:48:38.040,00:48:40.542,"If we fix it, Shepard might give us what we want."
00:48:42.210,00:48:44.671,He's not stupid. He'll have to listen.
00:48:47.132,00:48:48.842,You interviewed Edmund Kemper?
00:48:48.925,00:48:51.011,Not so much interviewed. More like a conversation.
00:48:51.094,00:48:53.889,He said interesting things that turned out to be really useful.
00:48:53.972,00:48:58.060,-What the fuck? -I just had this idea-- I don't want to hear your idea. I'm sick of your ideas.
00:48:58.143,00:49:00.687,It is not our job to commiserate with these people.
00:49:00.771,00:49:03.607,It is our job to electrocute them. How long has this been going on?
00:49:03.690,00:49:09.071,-Just when we were in Sacramento. -The conversations with Kemper shed light on things we've been exploring in the unit.
00:49:09.154,00:49:11.573,There's a correlation with what we're finding at crime scenes.
00:49:11.657,00:49:12.908,It proves that we're on track.
00:49:12.991,00:49:16.411,Proof the Federal Bureau of Investigation is on track after all these years?
00:49:16.495,00:49:19.081,"Well, golly, what a relief. I am so pleased for us."
00:49:19.164,00:49:21.291,"-We're pleased too. -Don't smart-mouth me, Holden!"
00:49:21.375,00:49:27.214,"You fucked up the Gonzales situation, pissed off the Sacramento DA, and you've been interviewing lifers in the state penitentiary."
00:49:27.297,00:49:33.345,"Sir, the insights during these visits may help us identify the person responsible for the attacks in Sacramento and prevent others."
00:49:33.428,00:49:36.056,"Wrong, wrong, and wrong. Here's what it is. Burn your notes."
00:49:36.139,00:49:39.393,Don't speak to me about this anymore. Don't put it in any reports. You're done.
00:49:39.476,00:49:40.519,"Excuse me, sir."
00:49:41.728,00:49:44.564,I truly believe there is a vein here that needs to be mined.
00:49:44.648,00:49:47.234,"Okay, kiddo. You're looking down the barrel."
00:49:47.734,00:49:50.612,"Three whole bags: censure, suspension, transfer."
00:50:05.711,00:50:06.753,Pardon me.
00:50:08.296,00:50:11.383,"Sir, permit me to speak. I've been doing this shit for seven years."
00:50:11.466,00:50:13.885,I trained Holden because he was transferred to my department.
00:50:13.969,00:50:15.762,He knows his criminal psychology.
00:50:15.846,00:50:19.474,"He's done his homework, worked his butt off, and now I think he's onto something."
00:50:19.558,00:50:21.727,Onto what? He made friends with the Coed Killer.
00:50:21.810,00:50:24.271,"If this is going to work, we need to talk to more subjects."
00:50:24.354,00:50:27.232,"More? No! What's next, Charles Manson? When's he booked for?"
00:50:27.315,00:50:28.942,We were thinking June.
00:50:29.651,00:50:30.736,I think it's right.
00:50:30.819,00:50:34.781,"We need to use whatever resource-- Resource, my ass! What's the matter, bored with golf?"
00:50:34.865,00:50:37.534,California jails are full of thrill killers and lust murderers.
00:50:37.617,00:50:40.537,"-And we put them there, that's our job. -Dying and rotting on the vine."
00:50:40.620,00:50:43.123,"Cry me a river, Holden. All the wasted potential."
00:50:43.206,00:50:44.332,"It is wasted potential, sir."
00:50:44.416,00:50:46.501,-We could be using these people. -Using how?
00:50:46.585,00:50:48.712,-Their knowledge and insight. -Of what?
00:50:50.005,00:50:52.466,Then we know what we're talking about when we speak to other law enforcement.
00:50:52.549,00:50:55.260,"-Can you make him shut up? -I have not been able to, sir."
00:50:56.845,00:51:00.474,How do we get ahead of crazy if we don't know how crazy thinks?
00:51:10.442,00:51:11.902,"I like you, Bill."
00:51:12.527,00:51:14.988,"I don't particularly like him, but I like you."
00:51:17.783,00:51:20.243,"Okay, you may continue with your little sideshow."
00:51:20.327,00:51:22.370,"However, no one can know about it. Clear?"
00:51:23.205,00:51:29.211,"You will relocate yourselves to the basement beneath Behavioral Sciences, reporting directly and exclusively to me."
00:51:29.294,00:51:30.921,The basement? I'm 44 years old.
00:51:31.004,00:51:34.257,You may dedicate ten hours of your 50-hour work week to this.
00:51:34.341,00:51:40.096,"If I deem any aspect of it to be unwarranted, unnecessary, or unsavory, I will end it. Do you both understand?"
00:51:40.180,00:51:41.097,Yes.
00:51:42.265,00:51:43.183,"And thank you, sir."
00:51:44.017,00:51:45.143,"Thank you, sir."
00:03:11.065,00:03:14.360,-I'm gonna grab coffee. You want some? -I had some on the plane.
00:03:20.450,00:03:22.619,Excuse me. May I?
00:03:36.633,00:03:38.801,"-Cold season. -Sorry, what?"
00:03:39.552,00:03:42.555,-I was just saying it's cold season. -Oh.
00:04:03.076,00:04:04.369,Here he is.
00:04:04.452,00:04:07.330,"Dr. Wendy Carr, my partner Holden Ford."
00:04:07.705,00:04:08.539,Dr. Carr.
00:04:08.623,00:04:11.334,Agent Ford. I've read a lot about you.
00:04:11.417,00:04:13.336,-About me? -Your notes.
00:04:13.419,00:04:14.837,"Uh, thank you."
00:04:15.546,00:04:17.590,"Okay, um, let's go to my office."
00:04:22.637,00:04:26.557,"When you sent me your notes from the Kemper meetings, I was in a real rut with my new book."
00:04:26.641,00:04:31.312,"-What's your book about? -It's about white-collar criminals, men not so different to your Edmund Kemper."
00:04:31.396,00:04:34.148,How do you think the men you study are similar to Edmund Kemper?
00:04:34.232,00:04:37.151,"Well, first of all, they're all psychopaths."
00:04:37.235,00:04:42.615,"I study captains of industry: IBM, MGM, Ford, Exxon, you name it."
00:04:42.699,00:04:50.915,"And sure, these men all have wives, kids, dogs, goldfish, but not because they stopped being psychopaths, but because they just had different leanings."
00:04:50.999,00:04:53.543,But you think they have the same underlying personality traits?
00:04:53.626,00:05:00.967,"Well, Kemper shows a total lack of remorse, a lack of inner emotional structure, no ability to reflect on the experience of others."
00:05:01.050,00:05:07.640,"-You saw this in my notes? -It would've been clearer if you'd recorded and transcribed your interviews verbatim, but yeah."
00:05:07.724,00:05:15.356,"Although your project is obviously in the nascent stages, it already feels like a clear successor to The Mask of Sanity, which, as you know, is quite a compliment."
00:05:15.898,00:05:17.233,Repeat that? The Mask of...
00:05:19.235,00:05:22.155,"us interviewing these killers, is crazy?"
00:05:23.406,00:05:26.784,"I mean, crazy in the way that anyone with a truly new idea is crazy."
00:05:26.868,00:05:29.412,"-But no. -Wow, okay."
00:05:29.912,00:05:31.122,That's a relief.
00:05:31.205,00:05:33.458,That hasn't really been the feedback we've gotten so far.
00:05:33.541,00:05:36.002,"Actually, this is the only feedback we've gotten so far."
00:05:36.085,00:05:38.212,"Well, these men are just sitting here, locked up."
00:05:38.296,00:05:42.592,And we're too afraid of the morality of it to see the far-reaching value of their insights.
00:05:42.675,00:05:44.677,Far-reaching in law enforcement?
00:05:44.761,00:05:48.890,"Into behavioral science, early detection, criminology, you name it."
00:05:49.015,00:05:51.476,"Oh, yes, yes. This is what I've been saying the whole time."
00:05:51.559,00:05:52.560,"Oh, have you?"
00:05:55.146,00:06:00.443,It's gonna take a lot of time and energy to expand it into a larger project with a specific questionnaire.
00:06:00.943,00:06:07.658,"Their family histories, what their thoughts were on why they did it, when they were aroused during the killings, that sort of thing."
00:06:07.742,00:06:10.578,"Then contrast, compare, and publish."
00:06:10.661,00:06:11.496,Publish?
00:06:14.248,00:06:16.292,"-I mean, maybe even turn it into a book. -A book?"
00:06:16.376,00:06:21.339,"Whoa. We appreciate the vote of confidence, but we weren't allowed to send you those notes."
00:06:26.385,00:06:27.887,and an office in the basement.
00:06:27.970,00:06:30.389,"We still have students, we have Road School full-time."
00:06:30.473,00:06:32.350,-We can't just drop everything-- -Road School?
00:06:32.433,00:06:35.436,We travel around the country and teach FBI techniques to cops.
00:06:35.520,00:06:38.523,-Oh. -We're seeing Benjamin Miller in Bridgewater this afternoon.
00:06:38.606,00:06:41.567,Road School is what gives us the freedom to go out and interview these guys.
00:06:41.651,00:06:43.194,We can go bit by bit.
00:06:43.277,00:06:45.196,Kemper and Miller and build out from there.
00:06:45.279,00:06:47.031,"Make a study in our free time, like you said."
00:06:47.115,00:06:49.158,I didn't realize that this was so informal.
00:06:49.242,00:06:53.329,We could make it formal. We can do that easily. And then a book.
00:06:53.412,00:07:00.795,"The successor to The Mask of-- I guess I just wanted to get another set of eyes, see if you thought this was valuable from an academic standpoint."
00:07:03.131,00:07:05.341,Have you shown your Kemper notes to your department head?
00:07:06.926,00:07:07.885,No.
00:07:07.969,00:07:10.304,"Teaching police departments, can someone else do that?"
00:07:10.388,00:07:14.559,"-Anyone can, it's really not that hard. -That is not true, and it's beside the point."
00:07:14.642,00:07:16.686,Shepard doesn't even want us to talk about this.
00:07:16.769,00:07:20.022,You really think he's going to say yes to a full-time academic study?
00:07:20.106,00:07:20.940,Never mind a book?
00:07:24.026,00:07:27.071,You think people would be interested in this outside of law enforcement?
00:07:28.781,00:07:34.704,"I mean, imagine, like truly imagine what it takes to bludgeon someone to death."
00:07:35.455,00:07:45.298,"The lust for control, the feeling of arousal, the decision to rape the severed head of your victim, to humiliate her corpse."
00:07:46.841,00:07:49.886,How could you possibly get that from an ordinary police report?
00:07:50.803,00:07:53.973,You know why it took me nearly a decade to publish my book?
00:07:54.390,00:07:57.310,Because narcissists don't go to the doctor.
00:07:57.810,00:08:00.438,Psychopaths are convinced that there is nothing wrong with them.
00:08:00.521,00:08:02.982,So these men are virtually impossible to study.
00:08:03.065,00:08:08.112,Yet you have found a way to study them in near perfect laboratory conditions.
00:08:08.196,00:08:11.824,That's what make this so exciting and potentially so far-reaching.
00:08:11.908,00:08:17.163,It's not that I disagree. I've spent enough time with Holden that I know what it means when he gets that crazy look.
00:08:20.666,00:08:26.797,"We've got weekends. We've got the evenings after Road School, an hour or so before Road School. We don't have to tell Shepard."
00:08:26.881,00:08:29.592,Interviewing 40 men across the States is a full-time job.
00:08:29.675,00:08:34.305,"And if you want this to be a legitimate academic study, then you're looking at four, maybe five years."
00:08:34.388,00:08:36.390,"-And compiling, analyzing the data. -Right."
00:08:42.063,00:08:43.064,It's a shame.
00:08:44.815,00:08:47.693,We have an interview with Miller in an hour and it's a bit of a drive.
00:08:50.863,00:08:52.657,"You know, this is really important work."
00:08:52.740,00:09:01.707,"If your boss won't let you do it, then you should talk to someone who has the freedom and resources to-- It'll be slow going, but we're not ready to give up yet."
00:09:01.791,00:09:02.959,Of course not.
00:09:03.042,00:09:06.337,"But it's good to get some encouragement, even if our hands are tied."
00:09:07.004,00:09:07.838,Thank you.
00:09:08.673,00:09:09.632,It's a pleasure.
00:09:11.717,00:09:12.635,-What if-- -Don't.
00:09:12.718,00:09:14.136,-I'm just saying we could-- -Holden.
00:09:16.889,00:09:18.641,"Look, I'm frustrated too."
00:09:21.352,00:09:25.648,"You know, they shoot the birds in the yard because they might be smuggling in drugs."
00:09:31.487,00:09:33.573,-You date a lot of ex-cons? -No.
00:09:34.991,00:09:38.828,"Actually, Debbie's the first girl I've really dated-dated since high school."
00:09:38.911,00:09:40.580,-Dated-dated. -Yeah.
00:09:41.163,00:09:43.833,My wife's the first woman that I've married-married.
00:09:46.335,00:09:48.671,I thought they said 3:00. What are we waiting for?
00:09:48.754,00:09:50.798,You'd be less fidgety if you smoked cigarettes.
00:09:52.133,00:09:53.718,I should have brought a tape recorder.
00:10:15.197,00:10:18.326,Gentlemen. I'm Dr. Cale. We spoke earlier on the phone.
00:10:18.409,00:10:21.746,"Thanks for doing this, Doctor. We realize it's somewhat unorthodox."
00:10:21.829,00:10:24.040,"Unfortunately, Miller says he won't talk to you."
00:10:24.123,00:10:28.252,"Now, we told him in advance and he agreed, but there's really nothing we can do now."
00:10:28.336,00:10:30.963,-He should be in a better mood tomorrow. -Tomorrow?
00:10:31.047,00:10:32.632,"Well, he gets like this sometimes."
00:10:32.715,00:10:35.343,Just needs a cool-off period before he can interact with people.
00:10:35.426,00:10:38.262,We have to bring him food into his cell because he won't come out.
00:10:38.346,00:10:40.431,We're headed out tonight. We can't come in tomorrow.
00:10:40.514,00:10:43.434,I'm sorry. Will you be back to Boston another time?
00:10:44.435,00:10:45.519,Perhaps.
00:10:45.603,00:10:47.563,"Thanks for your time, Doctor. We appreciate it."
00:10:47.647,00:10:48.648,Of course.
00:10:51.817,00:10:54.528,"Well, that's the last time we give them advanced notice."
00:11:15.466,00:11:16.509,Holden?
00:11:17.551,00:11:21.389,"Ever feel like you're on the cusp of something, and it keeps spinning out in your head?"
00:11:22.431,00:11:24.809,-Where'd you get that ironing board? -Your closet.
00:11:24.892,00:11:27.228,I just can't stop thinking about this project.
00:11:27.311,00:11:29.438,Dr. Carr said it could have far-reaching consequences.
00:11:29.522,00:11:32.024,Why are you up? Did you smoke my pot?
00:11:32.108,00:11:35.528,I can't stop thinking about this project. The idea is so exciting.
00:11:38.948,00:11:39.949,Okay.
00:11:41.325,00:11:43.828,Just don't wake me up when you come back to bed.
00:11:44.578,00:11:48.207,"Rissell's an hour or so away, so we don't have to do Road School to get to him."
00:11:49.041,00:11:51.877,"There's, uh... Vaughn Greenwood."
00:11:51.961,00:11:54.588,"-The Skid Row Slasher? -Yeah, he's in California."
00:11:56.799,00:11:58.384,The Cincinnati Strangler...
00:11:58.467,00:12:00.344,-What's his name? -Posteal Laskey Jr.
00:12:00.428,00:12:02.847,-I assume he's in Cincinnati? -Uh...
00:12:03.347,00:12:04.181,Yeah.
00:12:04.265,00:12:07.601,I like teaching the Midwest cops. Hospitable guys.
00:12:07.685,00:12:09.270,There's always Richard Speck in Illinois.
00:12:09.353,00:12:12.440,"-Great, we can do a Midwest sweep. -Gerard John Schaefer."
00:12:12.523,00:12:15.568,"He killed at least 30, they think. That was in Florida, though."
00:12:15.651,00:12:17.486,I can't say no to a Florida golf course.
00:12:26.954,00:12:27.913,Bill Tench.
00:12:27.997,00:12:30.749,"-Hey, Bill. It's Roy Carver. -Hey, Roy. What can I do for you?"
00:12:30.833,00:12:33.002,We need to talk. There's been another attack.
00:12:33.085,00:12:34.670,This time resulting in a fatality.
00:12:36.881,00:12:39.008,-Got it. -Can I get you guys back out here?
00:12:39.091,00:12:40.843,Okay. Let me get back to you.
00:12:42.845,00:12:44.847,-What's up? -Carver.
00:12:44.930,00:12:45.848,Been another one.
00:12:45.931,00:12:48.767,"Same age as Rosemary Gonzales, only this time she's dead."
00:12:50.436,00:12:53.189,"Bill, my God! We're vindicated."
00:12:53.272,00:12:55.774,What's the matter with you? An old lady was just murdered.
00:12:59.278,00:13:00.988,We can talk to Kemper again.
00:13:07.203,00:13:09.497,Did she have a dog? Please tell me there's a dog.
00:13:09.580,00:13:12.166,A bigger dog. Slit from ear to ear.
00:13:17.963,00:13:20.049,"but he's getting a taste for it, there will be more."
00:13:20.132,00:13:21.467,A sequence killer.
00:13:21.550,00:13:22.801,A sequence killer?
00:13:22.885,00:13:24.887,What we're calling it when they kill three or more.
00:13:24.970,00:13:28.390,Is this a new classification? Need to get a steno to put it in writing.
00:13:28.474,00:13:29.892,You bet. I'll talk to Marge.
00:13:30.434,00:13:32.394,This is what you were talking about with the Kemper thing?
00:13:32.478,00:13:35.481,We briefed them with a description. We need to make sure they bring him in.
00:13:35.564,00:13:38.359,"-It's what we predicted. -Thank you, Holden. I've been listening."
00:13:43.155,00:13:45.824,What are you waiting for? You got a plane to catch.
00:13:46.325,00:13:47.159,"Yes, sir."
00:14:09.390,00:14:12.309,"Living literally half a mile away, practically up the street."
00:14:12.393,00:14:16.480,"Same thing exactly, same time of night that Rosemary Gonzales was attacked, about 10:30 or 11:00."
00:14:16.564,00:14:17.523,What about the dog?
00:14:17.606,00:14:20.985,A dog like that must've put up a fight. Your unsub will have bite marks.
00:14:21.777,00:14:22.945,The dog's fucking lasagna.
00:14:23.028,00:14:27.616,"We rousted a bunch of kids, had an 18-year-old from the neighborhood we liked, but he had an alibi."
00:14:27.700,00:14:29.410,-What was it? -He's a fry cook.
00:14:29.493,00:14:32.037,"Clocked in till midnight, his coworkers vouch for him."
00:14:33.664,00:14:35.958,"Yeah, one of these new burger joints. Big corporate set up."
00:14:36.041,00:14:37.251,Like McDonald's?
00:14:37.334,00:14:39.670,"-Actually, I don't remember. -We might have to rethink."
00:14:39.753,00:14:41.213,Look at that dog.
00:14:42.214,00:14:45.718,"Someone had a good fucking grip on it, damn near eviscerated."
00:14:46.802,00:14:49.555,Now this woman wasn't as frail as Mrs. Gonzales.
00:14:49.638,00:14:51.807,Whoever did this wasn't easily scared off.
00:14:53.851,00:14:55.227,-Older. -And determined.
00:14:57.646,00:15:00.399,-Why just groping? Why not rape her? -Because he didn't want to.
00:15:00.482,00:15:02.860,He just wanted to dominate and humiliate her.
00:15:06.196,00:15:08.365,Supposing these women are his mom's age...
00:15:08.449,00:15:10.993,"-It's a mom thing. -Wait, 40? Did I just hear you correctly?"
00:15:11.076,00:15:13.829,-This is not a kid. -I've been rounding up teenagers.
00:15:13.913,00:15:16.498,This time wasn't as frenzied. It's not a teenager.
00:15:20.044,00:15:21.295,and you've changed your mind?
00:15:24.256,00:15:26.508,-This guy is getting confident. -At least late 20s.
00:15:26.592,00:15:29.762,Physically mature. Emotionally immature. Socially undeveloped.
00:15:29.845,00:15:32.431,"-Possibly still lives at home. -Narcotics, maybe."
00:15:32.514,00:15:35.142,"That's why he beat her this badly, didn't know when to stop."
00:15:36.393,00:15:38.687,Not if he lives at home. Maybe he's married.
00:15:38.771,00:15:40.773,-Or separated. -Separated?
00:15:40.856,00:15:42.900,Guys in unhappy marriages have hair triggers.
00:15:42.983,00:15:45.277,They lash out. Especially when it comes to women.
00:15:45.361,00:15:48.322,-I wouldn't know anything about that. -Lucky you.
00:15:48.405,00:15:50.950,You guys still think he's white? Not Latino? Black?
00:15:52.326,00:15:56.413,"I think blacks, Latinos might be too respectful of an elderly woman."
00:15:56.497,00:16:00.125,"-My bet is poor white trash. -Listen, we did talk to some older guys."
00:16:00.209,00:16:02.461,And this one right here is pretty interesting.
00:16:04.171,00:16:05.881,Just came walking up off the street.
00:16:05.965,00:16:08.384,"Hey, what happened? Did anybody see? He'd been drinking."
00:16:08.467,00:16:10.803,"One of these guys who likes talking to cops, you know."
00:16:14.848,00:16:15.933,We should talk to him.
00:16:17.476,00:16:18.435,Sure.
00:16:39.081,00:16:40.082,Good morning.
00:16:41.083,00:16:42.501,Do you remember me?
00:16:42.584,00:16:44.086,"Yeah, I remember you."
00:16:45.879,00:16:46.714,Mom!
00:16:51.343,00:16:52.803,"Ma'am, I'm Detective Roy Carver."
00:16:52.886,00:16:54.972,"These are my colleagues, Bill Tench and Holden Ford."
00:16:56.640,00:16:57.766,"It's Dwight, right?"
00:16:57.850,00:17:00.686,-What do you want with him? -These gentlemen are with the FBI.
00:17:03.772,00:17:06.775,Who the hell have you brought into my home?
00:17:18.037,00:17:20.080,FBI knocking at my door.
00:17:22.332,00:17:24.877,I might as well be dead for all he cares.
00:17:24.960,00:17:27.671,Just kill me now because that is what you're doing.
00:17:27.755,00:17:29.506,And it is a slow death.
00:17:30.007,00:17:37.431,"He's my only son. I might as well walk up to the freeway, stick my head under a truck and save myself the misery."
00:17:39.224,00:17:41.518,We'd just like to ask Dwight a few questions.
00:17:41.602,00:17:42.936,"Are these yours, Dwight?"
00:17:43.020,00:17:47.566,"You'd think he'd be out of my hair by now. Move the fuck on, but no."
00:17:48.400,00:17:51.445,-You sleep on the couch? -When he's not too drunk to get up there.
00:17:53.113,00:17:55.991,"Maybe we can talk outside, Dwight. Have a smoke."
00:17:56.075,00:17:57.159,Take him.
00:17:57.743,00:18:00.871,Just give me a fucking moment to breathe.
00:18:10.881,00:18:11.840,Cigarette?
00:18:16.720,00:18:17.846,Nice lady.
00:18:19.223,00:18:20.432,Real maternal.
00:18:27.272,00:18:28.816,"You have a lot of friends, Dwight?"
00:18:29.691,00:18:30.859,Do you?
00:18:32.861,00:18:36.198,"I saw a dog leash in the house, but I don't see a dog around here."
00:18:44.915,00:18:46.250,You got a girlfriend?
00:18:49.753,00:18:51.713,with your old lady breathing down your neck.
00:18:54.633,00:18:55.717,It's not hard?
00:18:56.718,00:18:58.137,I don't have a girlfriend.
00:18:58.220,00:19:00.430,Good-looking guy like you? I don't believe you.
00:19:03.851,00:19:06.103,"Put it this way, you never had a girlfriend?"
00:19:08.689,00:19:09.857,One time.
00:19:12.442,00:19:13.735,She got pregnant.
00:19:14.820,00:19:18.073,"My mom decided we were too young to get married, told her parents."
00:19:21.785,00:19:22.828,What happened to the kid?
00:19:26.373,00:19:27.416,Abortion.
00:19:32.546,00:19:35.966,That doesn't seem too young to me. Did you love her?
00:19:37.176,00:19:39.303,I don't know. What kind of fucking question is that?
00:19:41.638,00:19:43.807,"Well, I don't know, is the answer."
00:19:44.850,00:19:46.268,Do you think she loved you?
00:19:50.314,00:19:53.275,"-You okay there, Dwight? -What?"
00:19:53.358,00:19:55.736,Looks like you've been going at your arm pretty good.
00:19:57.070,00:19:58.280,You get in a scrap?
00:20:04.453,00:20:05.913,How'd you get those scratches?
00:20:05.996,00:20:07.789,I get drunk. I don't know.
00:20:07.873,00:20:09.791,I've never seen alcohol give a guy scratches.
00:20:10.334,00:20:12.336,"I bump into things, I guess."
00:20:14.880,00:20:17.382,I got them from a piece of wood.
00:20:18.008,00:20:20.385,"-It's fine, I'm fine. -Let me look at that again, Dwight."
00:20:25.724,00:20:26.975,I don't have a dog.
00:20:32.731,00:20:33.565,Dwight.
00:20:36.401,00:20:42.950,"Why don't you tell us right now how you got those scratches so you don't lie to an FBI agent, okay?"
00:20:44.493,00:20:49.122,I got them from a piece of wood.
00:20:54.253,00:20:56.755,-Is it just you and her in there? -And Jesse.
00:20:58.257,00:20:59.591,Some guy.
00:21:03.470,00:21:05.681,-Not a big smoker? -I smoke.
00:21:06.682,00:21:09.268,"Doesn't it get cramped in there, the three of you all together?"
00:21:10.811,00:21:13.438,-I guess. -Is that new? Jesse staying with you?
00:21:15.440,00:21:16.942,A few weeks.
00:21:18.443,00:21:22.072,They just met or whatever.
00:21:24.574,00:21:26.827,"Is that kinda weird, hearing your mom and her boyfriend?"
00:21:29.579,00:21:31.206,She sounds like she's hard to please.
00:21:31.290,00:21:34.042,-Does he do what she wants? -She doesn't know what she wants.
00:21:36.878,00:21:41.466,"Who just meets a guy, then she moves him right in, you know?"
00:21:41.550,00:21:43.719,-Kind of fucking weird. -You ever talk to her about it?
00:21:43.802,00:21:44.636,What?
00:21:46.805,00:21:49.057,Do you get a say in her romantic life?
00:21:50.475,00:21:53.979,"I mean, he's living right next to you. Do you get a say in hearing them fuck?"
00:21:54.062,00:21:57.566,"I think that would piss me off, if my mom told me what to do all the time."
00:21:57.649,00:21:59.443,"Get an abortion, get her this, get her that."
00:22:04.656,00:22:06.950,-Didn't hear you doing that. -Didn't hear him say anything.
00:22:07.034,00:22:09.077,I stand my ground. I'm no pussy.
00:22:09.161,00:22:12.456,I'm not saying you're a pussy. Why do you stand there and take it?
00:22:16.126,00:22:18.295,-I give as good as I get. -What does that mean?
00:22:21.631,00:22:24.259,"-But not with Mom, right? Mom's different. -You only have one mom."
00:22:24.343,00:22:27.345,"Never laid a finger on her. Didn't raise a hand, of course not."
00:22:27.429,00:22:29.890,"Raise a hand to your mom, it all goes to shit, right?"
00:22:37.898,00:22:40.901,-You ever lost control? -Uh-uh.
00:22:46.990,00:22:50.869,You'd never hurt your old lady-- You'd never hurt her because she loves you.
00:23:03.924,00:23:10.388,Sacramento Police have arrested 30-year-old Dwight Taylor in connection with a recent pair of sadistic assaults.
00:23:10.472,00:23:19.481,"Police say Taylor, himself a resident of the sleepy suburb, beat Rosemary Gonzales, 74, into a coma, and stabbed to death Laura Conway, 64."
00:23:19.564,00:23:21.733,The victims lived less than a mile apart.
00:23:21.817,00:23:25.612,"In a disturbing twist, after viciously attacking his elderly victims..."
00:23:32.536,00:23:34.246,"All right, all right, all right."
00:23:34.788,00:23:40.252,"Listen, everybody in this room remembers when they were a little kid, when they figured out they wanted to be a cop."
00:23:41.336,00:23:47.050,I knew I wanted to be a detective in the third grade when I read A Study in Scarlet by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
00:23:48.260,00:23:49.761,"Well, this guy right here?"
00:23:57.936,00:23:59.104,Thank you.
00:23:59.187,00:24:00.772,No shit.
00:24:03.775,00:24:16.788,"Hey, don't laugh. There's a lot of psychics in California Oh! He's gonna make a speech. Inform us, oh, wise one."
00:24:20.500,00:24:23.128,I just wanted to say thank you for having this get-together.
00:24:23.211,00:24:26.715,"And Roy, thank you for acknowledging what my partner Bill and I are doing."
00:24:29.801,00:24:37.267,"And for embracing that, if we all work together, we can venture into the blackest night and shine a light on the darkness."
00:24:41.229,00:24:43.648,I'm talking about real darkness.
00:24:48.028,00:24:49.446,We were happy to help.
00:24:50.197,00:24:51.990,"Congratulations, guys."
00:24:52.073,00:24:53.491,Good work.
00:25:01.082,00:25:13.178,"If only you could shine a light on the darkness, Very, very funny."
00:25:34.783,00:25:35.784,Good job.
00:25:51.716,00:25:52.884,His teacher?
00:25:59.808,00:26:00.976,I'm sorry to hear that.
00:26:04.688,00:26:06.690,"No, I don't think we'll be back in time."
00:26:10.235,00:26:11.236,So...
00:26:14.489,00:26:17.575,Okay. I just wanted to hear your voice.
00:26:19.077,00:26:20.578,Give him a kiss from Dad.
00:26:23.248,00:26:24.416,Love you too.
00:26:35.427,00:26:38.555,do you mean that violence in the movies drove you to kill those women?
00:26:38.638,00:26:39.597,No.
00:26:39.681,00:26:43.810,"My point is, in reality, it doesn't work the way you expect."
00:26:43.893,00:26:47.147,"When you stab somebody, they're supposed to fall dead."
00:26:47.230,00:26:48.189,"They go, Oh..."
00:26:48.273,00:26:50.608,"-And they fall dead, right? -Right."
00:26:50.692,00:26:57.615,"In reality, when you stab somebody, they lose blood pressure and they leak to death very slowly."
00:26:57.699,00:27:00.410,"So I was reluctant, I didn't enjoy it."
00:27:01.703,00:27:03.204,Did you get that on tape?
00:27:03.872,00:27:04.789,Yeah.
00:27:08.001,00:27:15.258,"You know, it all really goes back to my perceived inability to communicate socially, sexually."
00:27:16.134,00:27:22.057,"I was scared to death of failing in male-female relationships, even sitting down to talk to a young lady."
00:27:23.475,00:27:25.143,I wanted to communicate.
00:27:25.685,00:27:28.897,"Ironically enough, that's why I began picking people up."
00:27:28.980,00:27:33.068,I pick a girl up and I'm going a little further each time.
00:27:33.151,00:27:35.153,It's a daring kind of a thing.
00:27:35.236,00:27:37.447,"Like, first, there wasn't a gun."
00:27:37.530,00:27:43.870,"Then I'm driving along, we go to a vulnerable place where there aren't people watching, but I say, No, I can't."
00:27:43.953,00:27:46.122,So you picked up women but didn't kill them?
00:27:46.206,00:27:54.506,"But then, a gun is in the car, and this craving, this awful raging, eating feeling is inside me."
00:27:55.757,00:28:04.974,"I would've loved to have just raped them, but not having any experience at all, I could feel it consuming my insides, this fantastic passion."
00:28:05.058,00:28:06.935,Fantastic passion?
00:28:07.018,00:28:10.271,"-It's a good phrase, no? -Then what happens?"
00:28:10.355,00:28:12.315,"You know, I'm thinking of writing my own book."
00:28:12.399,00:28:15.360,I've been trying to get a typewriter. Maybe help me with that?
00:28:15.443,00:28:17.404,I'm sure we could pull some strings.
00:28:17.695,00:28:19.280,"Then it builds, the feeling?"
00:28:19.364,00:28:20.949,"At some point, you begin to..."
00:28:24.077,00:28:33.711,"when you slit a person's throat, you need to cut it from ear to ear in order to sever the windpipe and the jugular so that they bleed and suffocate at the same time."
00:28:33.795,00:28:35.880,"Otherwise, they'll just be in a great deal of pain."
00:28:37.298,00:28:41.094,"That's how I learnt the term ear to ear, literally, what that meant."
00:28:41.177,00:28:43.513,People think it's just an expression.
00:28:43.596,00:28:45.473,"It's not, it's an instruction."
00:28:45.557,00:28:48.309,You don't want to. You have to.
00:28:48.393,00:28:49.769,"So there's no pleasure, Ed?"
00:28:51.187,00:28:53.982,I just wanted the exaltation over the party.
00:28:54.607,00:28:56.443,"In other words, winning over death."
00:28:57.026,00:28:59.821,They were dead and I was alive. That was the pleasure.
00:28:59.904,00:29:02.615,"I was the hunter, they were my victims."
00:29:02.699,00:29:04.743,So how did you feel after your first kills?
00:29:11.416,00:29:13.501,I liked Mary the best.
00:29:13.585,00:29:15.503,I was lukewarm on Anita.
00:29:17.213,00:29:18.506,What was wrong with her?
00:29:21.009,00:29:22.844,It was more that Mary was...
00:29:25.263,00:29:31.686,"I was really quite struck by her personality and her looks, and there was just almost a reverence there."
00:29:31.770,00:29:33.855,-Reverence? -Sure.
00:29:34.355,00:29:38.359,"Sometimes, afterward, I visited there to be near her because I loved her and wanted her."
00:29:39.027,00:29:40.278,At the murder site?
00:29:40.361,00:29:44.866,"I've never been much to look at myself, but I've always gone after the pretty girls."
00:29:44.949,00:29:46.034,I bet you're the same.
00:29:47.619,00:29:48.620,Sure.
00:29:49.829,00:30:00.256,"You probably can't imagine this, but since I was locked up from age 15 to 21 for the murder of my grandparents, I was very much out of touch with women my own age."
00:30:00.799,00:30:04.344,"When I got back on the street, it was like being on a strange planet."
00:30:04.928,00:30:09.140,"I had been living with people older than I was for so long, I was like an old fogy."
00:30:09.224,00:30:10.809,That must have been jarring.
00:30:12.811,00:30:16.815,they drove me through California and we stopped by a diner for some food.
00:30:16.898,00:30:19.984,Some attractive young ladies walked by the car.
00:30:20.735,00:30:21.903,I vomited.
00:30:22.320,00:30:25.740,"Right there and then, on the police car, in front of all the cops."
00:30:25.824,00:30:26.866,Quite violently.
00:30:26.950,00:30:29.452,That was just how I reacted to women.
00:30:29.536,00:30:30.912,I had no other way.
00:30:31.913,00:30:33.164,Let me ask you something.
00:30:35.542,00:30:37.001,Ever talk with anyone about this?
00:30:37.877,00:30:39.462,About your inclinations?
00:30:41.297,00:30:43.383,Your mom... maybe?
00:30:44.008,00:30:46.177,"Obviously, not the way you're talking to us."
00:30:48.555,00:30:54.352,"If I could get a word in edgewise, everything would have been different."
00:30:54.435,00:30:58.773,"From the moment I woke up in the morning, she was demeaning and belittling."
00:30:58.857,00:31:02.026,And she knew all of my buttons because she put them there.
00:31:03.319,00:31:08.074,"I was her toy all my life, right up until the moment I cut off her head with a hunting knife."
00:31:10.702,00:31:11.703,Ed...
00:31:13.162,00:31:15.206,why did you do what you did...
00:31:16.875,00:31:17.959,with her head?
00:31:20.545,00:31:21.963,Why does anyone?
00:31:23.965,00:31:26.009,"You know, that night I walked up to her bed."
00:31:26.092,00:31:30.471,"She's laying there reading a paperback, as many thousands of nights before."
00:31:31.598,00:31:36.811,"She says, Oh, I suppose you're gonna want to wait up all night and talk now."
00:31:38.229,00:31:39.564,Can you believe that?
00:31:40.231,00:31:42.317,Wait up all night talking.
00:31:43.526,00:31:44.569,Shit.
00:31:47.405,00:31:49.240,And I knew I was gonna kill her...
00:31:50.158,00:31:51.075,you know?
00:31:52.327,00:31:54.662,I was honest with myself for the first time.
00:31:56.414,00:32:01.920,"Because I'm not a lizard, I'm not from under a rock, I came out of her vagina."
00:32:02.587,00:32:03.796,I came out of my mother.
00:32:05.006,00:32:08.426,Is it true that you put part of her into the garbage disposal?
00:32:10.595,00:32:12.013,Her vocal cords.
00:32:12.680,00:32:13.848,Why?
00:32:13.932,00:32:15.600,Because I couldn't shut her up.
00:32:16.100,00:32:20.188,"She wanted to destroy me with words, literally."
00:32:20.271,00:32:21.940,So I shut her up for good.
00:32:23.274,00:32:28.947,"And now, everyone knows it was because of what she did to me, because of the way she treated her son."
00:32:38.581,00:32:39.624,Pizza!
00:32:40.541,00:32:41.918,You guys.
00:32:44.587,00:32:47.215,Okay. So you get out of the car...
00:32:47.507,00:32:50.718,-I just walk into the apartment building. -Anyone around?
00:32:50.802,00:32:57.350,"So, I'm home, walking up the stairs to our apartment with a freshly severed head draining about a pint of blood into a duffel bag."
00:32:57.433,00:33:00.103,You just got it under your arm? Just like that?
00:33:02.522,00:33:07.443,"Then comes this picture postcard, groovy, happy young couple on the stairs."
00:33:07.527,00:33:10.238,-They walk right past me. -Your two worlds are colliding...
00:33:10.321,00:33:12.865,My murderous fantasy life and this.
00:33:12.949,00:33:16.077,Pretty girl. Pretty name. Kim or something.
00:33:16.494,00:33:18.246,Going out on a date with her boyfriend.
00:33:18.329,00:33:20.957,And it could just as easily be Kim's head in that bag.
00:33:21.040,00:33:22.917,-You're playing God. -Exactly.
00:33:23.001,00:33:27.588,"And I realized I've never been on a date in my entire life, ever."
00:33:28.172,00:33:33.011,"And I got in the door and I said to Mom, I've never been on a date with a girl, Mom."
00:33:37.557,00:33:40.476,That's when I started burying the heads in the backyard.
00:33:40.560,00:33:43.187,-Sure. -Right underneath Mom's bedroom window.
00:33:43.271,00:33:46.399,Their faces looking right up at her window while she was at home.
00:33:46.482,00:33:48.776,"Right under her nose, man. I couldn't help myself."
00:33:48.860,00:33:49.777,What the fuck?
00:33:50.862,00:33:54.323,"I know it's silly, but Mom always liked people to look up to her."
00:34:40.828,00:34:42.246,I still smell like Kemper.
00:35:00.056,00:35:01.057,So...
00:35:02.100,00:35:03.226,you like your mom?
00:35:05.103,00:35:06.437,Sorry. Not funny.
00:35:08.397,00:35:10.525,Yeah. I liked my mom.
00:35:11.150,00:35:12.610,But she's not around anymore.
00:35:16.447,00:35:17.698,You like your wife?
00:35:19.575,00:35:21.619,"-Yes, I do. -That's good."
00:35:23.204,00:35:26.666,I've known her all my life. I'm not sure what I'd do without her.
00:35:27.834,00:35:29.627,-How about that girlfriend? -Yeah.
00:35:30.711,00:35:32.547,She's great. Smart.
00:35:33.464,00:35:34.674,I think she actually likes me.
00:35:36.843,00:35:38.302,Sounds like we got it made.
00:35:41.514,00:35:44.475,"To fly home having got the bad guy, just like in the movies."
00:35:45.143,00:35:47.395,Yeah. It feels good that Dwight's off the street.
00:35:47.478,00:35:49.605,But Kemper has a way of tempering that.
00:35:50.106,00:35:52.567,"He makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't he?"
00:35:53.109,00:35:54.235,Yes.
00:35:54.318,00:35:55.361,More than Dwight?
00:35:55.444,00:35:59.323,There's nothing behind Kemper's eyes. It's like standing near a black hole.
00:36:00.908,00:36:03.786,-Right. -And he thinks we're his friends.
00:36:03.870,00:36:06.747,"Well, he thinks you're his friend."
00:36:08.875,00:36:11.127,Which makes you a pretty great FBI agent.
00:36:22.054,00:36:24.348,I've been thinking about our conversation with Dr. Carr.
00:36:27.602,00:36:28.686,You have?
00:36:30.730,00:36:34.442,"We're good at this shit, even if it turns my stomach."
00:36:34.984,00:36:38.404,"If we're gonna take a backseat to everything new, everything interesting..."
00:36:38.487,00:36:39.614,Yeah.
00:36:39.697,00:36:45.661,"If she really thinks the idea is that good, that it has that much potential to change people's lives..."
00:36:46.871,00:36:49.040,-Yeah? -...maybe we should invite her down.
00:36:49.498,00:36:52.001,"Just for a day, to strategize."
00:36:53.002,00:36:54.837,I think that's a fantastic idea.
00:36:54.921,00:37:01.052,At least we could compile what we have so far and create a plan so if we want to talk to Shepard-- So we can be prepared.
00:37:03.554,00:37:04.722,It's a long shot.
00:37:05.306,00:37:06.474,He hates you already.
00:37:07.767,00:37:09.602,"He's beginning to hate you, too."
00:37:12.396,00:37:13.397,Right.
00:37:14.982,00:37:16.609,So why half-ass it?
00:37:25.159,00:37:27.662,It's kind of prosaic that it's always the mother.
00:37:28.246,00:37:31.999,"It was the mother, but in a very different way."
00:37:33.125,00:37:34.126,More...
00:37:34.961,00:37:36.212,love.
00:37:36.295,00:37:37.880,If you can even call it that.
00:37:38.589,00:37:39.674,Was she hot?
00:37:40.216,00:37:41.884,-Who? -His mom?
00:37:44.971,00:37:49.141,Guys in my high school thought my mom was hot and it always really disgusted me.
00:37:49.684,00:37:55.815,But then she went through chemo and nobody made jokes about her anymore -and it kind of made me sad. -I didn't know your mom had cancer.
00:37:56.315,00:37:59.193,That's why I'm always asking you to grab my boobs when we're fucking.
00:38:09.537,00:38:11.789,I can't let these guys rub off on me.
00:38:11.872,00:38:14.125,-The way they view sex. -And women.
00:38:24.302,00:38:25.553,Thanks for coming.
00:38:26.721,00:38:28.139,I needed to see you.
00:38:32.518,00:38:34.061,And now that I'm all clean...
00:38:37.231,00:38:41.444,If going down on me while I'm filing my nails is your idea of being kinky...
00:38:42.111,00:38:43.237,I'm kinky.
00:38:48.451,00:38:49.452,I'm very kinky.
00:38:50.995,00:38:53.581,I could impale you with this nail file.
00:38:54.457,00:38:56.751,Then I could be a part of your case study.
00:38:56.834,00:38:59.337,You would be a very compelling interviewee.
00:39:19.190,00:39:20.775,"Oh, sure. What's on your mind?"
00:39:21.025,00:39:24.820,"I've, uh, done a bit of thinking about some of the things that we're teaching."
00:39:24.904,00:39:28.032,"In particular, the list of deviant terminology."
00:39:28.115,00:39:29.158,The cuss words?
00:39:29.241,00:39:31.327,"Right. Well, I was thinking more the..."
00:39:32.286,00:39:34.914,-descriptors of the acts. -Uh...
00:39:34.997,00:39:39.001,"You know, fellatio, cunnilingus-- Okay, what exactly is the issue?"
00:39:39.085,00:39:41.337,"Well, that's just it, Ken. I don't have an issue."
00:39:41.754,00:39:43.756,I really don't know that they are deviant.
00:39:44.757,00:39:45.800,Anal violation?
00:39:46.425,00:39:47.551,"Well, no, not that one."
00:39:47.635,00:39:49.720,"-Have you talked to Bill about this? -Oh, sure."
00:39:49.804,00:39:51.263,Bill agrees with me.
00:39:52.098,00:39:54.100,And you think we should alter the curriculum?
00:39:54.558,00:39:56.936,Just... take a look at the list.
00:39:57.645,00:39:59.563,"-Think about it, okay? -Mm-hmm. Hmm."
00:40:05.611,00:40:06.737,Fuckbag?
00:40:07.279,00:40:08.280,"That, too."
00:40:08.364,00:40:09.990,And we're keeping gang bang?
00:40:10.074,00:40:11.242,What's right is right.
00:40:12.118,00:40:12.993,Klismaphilia?
00:40:15.746,00:40:17.748,Enemas. Either giving or having.
00:40:20.000,00:40:20.835,That can stay.
00:40:22.920,00:40:29.301,"And we're losing pussy, dildo, fellatio, cunnilingus."
00:40:29.385,00:40:30.719,Are you sure about this?
00:40:30.803,00:40:31.762,Yes.
00:40:31.846,00:40:32.930,"Thank you, Marge."
00:40:34.348,00:40:35.433,It's for the best.
00:40:36.725,00:40:37.726,All right.
00:40:40.980,00:40:43.107,I consulted her on a few cases here and there.
00:40:43.190,00:40:45.693,We go back a few years. Why do you ask?
00:40:45.776,00:40:46.777,Just curious.
00:40:50.322,00:40:51.323,No.
00:40:51.407,00:40:53.075,-No? -You know what I mean.
00:40:53.159,00:40:55.661,"-I didn't mean to imply-- -I enjoy being married, thank you."
00:40:55.744,00:40:56.954,I didn't mean...
00:40:58.789,00:41:00.249,Just... Wendy has something.
00:41:00.332,00:41:01.667,Not sexual.
00:41:04.044,00:41:05.212,Maybe a little sexual.
00:41:05.296,00:41:09.258,"But her ideas and her energy, she... I sound like an idiot."
00:41:09.800,00:41:11.594,You sound like you have a crush on teacher.
00:41:11.677,00:41:15.014,It's just someone like her embracing this project says something.
00:41:16.640,00:41:18.934,-Don't you think? -I get it.
00:41:19.018,00:41:21.145,"Old Man Tench jumps onboard, so what?"
00:41:21.228,00:41:23.272,"Grumpy old Shepard, who cares?"
00:41:23.355,00:41:25.733,-But the foxy professor-- -That's not fair.
00:41:33.407,00:41:35.034,-Dr. Carr. -Agent Ford.
00:41:37.620,00:41:38.704,How was your trip?
00:41:39.371,00:41:44.752,"It was a little dull to be honest. I was grading papers, but-- We can stop at the cafeteria for a coffee if you like."
00:41:44.835,00:41:46.754,"No, I'm fine. I had some this morning."
00:41:47.922,00:41:49.256,We're just this way.
00:41:51.175,00:41:52.551,So what are you teaching?
00:41:53.344,00:41:58.098,"Um, I'm teaching a class on the intersection of sociopathy and fame."
00:41:58.641,00:42:01.727,"People like, um... Andy Warhol, Jim Morrison."
00:42:02.019,00:42:05.523,Their celebrity becomes the only thing they need to sustain their ego.
00:42:05.606,00:42:08.359,-Nixon was a sociopath. -Very similar.
00:42:08.776,00:42:12.112,How do you get to be president of the United States if you're a sociopath?
00:42:12.196,00:42:21.872,"The question is, how do you get to be president of the United States That's why this work is so vital. It goes so much further than the FBI."
00:01:11.571,00:01:13.239,I didn't realize you were still in the house.
00:01:15.241,00:01:16.409,Here's the estimate.
00:01:17.827,00:01:19.037,House looks good.
00:01:19.120,00:01:21.664,Can't think you need much beyond door and window sensors.
00:01:21.748,00:01:23.833,I included in the cost three keypads.
00:01:25.043,00:01:31.382,"My husband wondered, would you ever just sell the stickers for the windows and a sign for the front lawn?"
00:01:34.344,00:01:35.929,"Signs come with the sensors, I'm afraid."
00:03:56.694,00:03:57.987,"Falls Church, Virginia."
00:03:58.529,00:04:00.365,They sentenced him a few weeks ago.
00:04:00.448,00:04:03.284,"Five victims, all women, raped and murdered."
00:04:03.368,00:04:04.410,Method?
00:04:04.494,00:04:08.122,First and last victim were beaten and then drowned. Middle three stabbed.
00:04:08.206,00:04:10.833,"-I thought one of them was shot, no? -No."
00:04:31.229,00:04:35.275,Virginia State Penitentiary. Monte Ralph Rissell.
00:04:50.290,00:04:51.374,Monte Rissell.
00:04:53.876,00:04:55.586,-Why don't you have a seat? -Monte.
00:04:55.670,00:04:57.672,"Hey, you guys need me for any of this?"
00:04:57.755,00:05:00.091,"No, thank you. We'd prefer to talk with you alone."
00:05:06.347,00:05:08.975,"My name's Bill Tench. This is my partner, Holden Ford."
00:05:09.475,00:05:12.729,We're from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Behavioral Science Unit.
00:05:13.146,00:05:15.982,-Scientists? -We're from the Behavioral Science Unit.
00:05:16.816,00:05:18.026,We're doing research.
00:05:18.109,00:05:20.695,Interviewing... men like you.
00:05:22.322,00:05:23.531,Men like me?
00:05:25.616,00:05:27.702,To better understand why you do what you do.
00:05:30.038,00:05:31.080,"I'd like to know, too."
00:05:40.298,00:05:42.925,-You think this might help? -Help with what?
00:05:44.343,00:05:45.678,Find a cure.
00:05:56.064,00:05:57.482,Think I could get some Big Red?
00:05:58.608,00:05:59.776,Big Red?
00:06:00.401,00:06:01.652,Pop.
00:06:01.736,00:06:03.071,"You know, like, soda."
00:06:04.322,00:06:06.115,Used to have it when I was a kid.
00:06:09.327,00:06:11.954,-We'll see what we can do. -That'll depend on the insights.
00:06:13.122,00:06:14.665,I can't get stuff like that in here.
00:06:17.043,00:06:18.503,What do you want to know?
00:06:22.423,00:06:24.300,Why I raped those girls in Florida?
00:06:24.717,00:06:26.886,"For starters, how did you choose your victims?"
00:06:26.969,00:06:27.804,Victims?
00:06:29.597,00:06:30.765,That doesn't sound good.
00:06:31.557,00:06:32.892,"No, it doesn't."
00:06:35.478,00:06:38.564,How many other... men like me are you talking to?
00:06:38.648,00:06:39.816,"Quite a few, Monte."
00:06:40.733,00:06:41.984,They all talk to you?
00:06:43.903,00:06:46.322,It's... early days.
00:06:46.405,00:06:47.490,Hmm...
00:06:49.617,00:06:51.994,"-Really think you can get some Big Red? -Look at me, Monte."
00:06:52.078,00:06:53.663,Let's stay on track.
00:06:55.706,00:06:56.749,You know what?
00:07:01.045,00:07:03.756,"You want to diddle around, we'll walk out of here."
00:07:04.715,00:07:13.516,"We'll go have a nice, leisurely lunch wherever the fuck we want, and then take the picturesque drive back to Quantico."
00:07:15.518,00:07:17.145,What's the rest of your day look like?
00:07:19.272,00:07:28.322,"What my partner's too polite to say is, we're talking to men like you because we can't understand how someone could fuck up their life so completely before he's barely old enough to vote."
00:07:30.700,00:07:31.742,Okay.
00:07:35.872,00:07:38.082,I first got into trouble at 14.
00:07:39.083,00:07:41.419,"They sent me to Florida. This, uh..."
00:07:45.548,00:07:48.301,Doctors watching over me all the time.
00:07:51.429,00:07:54.682,I had four girls while I was under observation.
00:07:54.765,00:07:57.185,"But you didn't kill those girls in Florida, that came later."
00:08:01.022,00:08:01.981,Hmm...
00:08:03.900,00:08:05.067,Let's see.
00:08:06.068,00:08:07.403,They let me out.
00:08:08.237,00:08:12.325,"I come back up here, get myself a job, a girlfriend."
00:08:12.825,00:08:18.581,"Girlfriend's a year ahead, she goes off to state college, but, you know, we keep in touch, we write."
00:08:20.666,00:08:21.751,"You're taping it, man."
00:08:21.834,00:08:24.045,Taking notes helps with transcription.
00:08:24.128,00:08:26.589,"You were saying? Back in school, a free man..."
00:08:28.549,00:08:32.220,"Probation, counseling, therapy."
00:08:33.554,00:08:35.431,I gotta keep checking in or they send me back.
00:08:35.515,00:08:37.350,But you got yourself a girlfriend...
00:08:37.892,00:08:38.809,"Do I, though?"
00:08:40.186,00:08:41.479,You know chicks.
00:08:42.271,00:08:43.940,She sends me a letter.
00:08:44.023,00:08:47.360,"Tells me, shocker, there's all these guys up at school, you know."
00:08:47.443,00:08:48.486,"There's all this, uh..."
00:08:52.198,00:08:56.035,"She tells me, in so many words, she wants to ball other guys."
00:08:57.828,00:08:59.664,What am I supposed to do with that?
00:09:00.373,00:09:06.045,"I hop in the car, gotta see it for myself, and what do you know, there she is, making out with some dork."
00:09:08.589,00:09:09.966,"What a dumbshit, right?"
00:09:10.925,00:09:11.842,Chicks.
00:09:13.302,00:09:14.512,What can you do?
00:09:20.518,00:09:22.520,I'll tell you what you can fucking do.
00:09:23.354,00:09:34.323,"I get some beer, because I'm fucking angry, I have some weed, and I'm smoking, and thinking, and driving, and drinking, and then..."
00:09:36.200,00:09:41.914,"Then I'm back at my apartment, in the parking lot, no idea how I got there."
00:09:43.541,00:09:45.251,A car pulls into the lot.
00:09:45.793,00:09:49.672,"Girl on her own, maybe 20, 25."
00:09:51.007,00:09:52.925,It's got to be four in the morning.
00:09:54.635,00:09:55.636,It's like...
00:09:56.178,00:10:01.601,the idea of doing it pops in your head like a...
00:10:05.354,00:10:07.648,"Like a sneeze, you know what I mean?"
00:10:08.816,00:10:18.451,"I hop out the car, tap on the window, pull the gun, drag her into the woods, rip her fucking panties off, hike up her skirt."
00:10:18.534,00:10:21.662,"Oh, yeah, give it to me, baby! I want it, I'm so horny."
00:10:21.746,00:10:23.831,"I'm trying to rape her, but she won't shut up."
00:10:28.336,00:10:31.297,"You know, she's stronger than me, but I'm fast."
00:10:31.881,00:10:34.842,I catch up to her. I get her in a headlock.
00:10:34.925,00:10:36.135,I choke her.
00:10:36.218,00:10:40.473,We go rolling down the hill into a stream. The whole thing is fucking chaos.
00:10:40.556,00:10:44.602,"I smash her head against a rock, hold her underwater..."
00:10:47.021,00:10:48.397,and that's that.
00:10:50.316,00:10:51.484,No more drama.
00:10:53.819,00:10:55.821,"You had a gun, why not use it?"
00:10:57.615,00:10:59.241,I wanted to cool her off.
00:10:59.325,00:11:00.576,Do you think-- Pardon me.
00:11:01.661,00:11:04.872,Do you think it would've ended differently if she hadn't...
00:11:08.668,00:11:09.752,A fucking prostitute?
00:11:11.545,00:11:13.422,"Yeah, could be. Could be."
00:11:15.091,00:11:17.385,Your science buddy might have something there.
00:11:19.178,00:11:24.016,"Second time, this blonde chick, she will not stop with the questions."
00:11:24.100,00:11:29.730,"I have her driving at gunpoint, and she's like, Why are you doing this? Don't you have a girlfriend?"
00:11:29.814,00:11:32.358,What are you planning to do? Why me?
00:11:32.441,00:11:33.692,Is that why you stabbed her?
00:11:34.360,00:11:35.403,I had to.
00:11:36.487,00:11:37.822,Shut her the fuck up.
00:11:42.576,00:11:43.411,Yeah.
00:11:44.453,00:11:48.541,"By the third girl, you could say I had, uh... perfected the routine."
00:11:48.624,00:11:49.917,"You stabbed her, too?"
00:11:50.418,00:11:51.544,Yeah.
00:11:54.296,00:11:55.923,I stabbed her so many times.
00:11:56.799,00:11:57.967,Yeesh...
00:12:04.056,00:12:04.974,Yeah.
00:12:05.349,00:12:09.145,"We're in the car, I'm getting ready, she has no idea."
00:12:09.937,00:12:13.023,"All of a sudden she starts crying, out of nowhere."
00:12:13.107,00:12:16.193,Tells me her daddy's dying... Cancer.
00:12:19.905,00:12:21.490,My brother had cancer.
00:12:22.783,00:12:24.243,"Cancer. It's, uh..."
00:12:24.952,00:12:26.162,"It's a bitch, man."
00:12:27.913,00:12:29.665,"Yeah, it's hard on a human being."
00:12:30.249,00:12:31.625,So I let her go.
00:12:32.793,00:12:34.086,"It's, uh..."
00:12:36.172,00:12:39.592,"-It's a weird feeling, man. -What's a weird feeling, Monte?"
00:12:39.675,00:12:40.593,Um...
00:12:41.802,00:12:43.220,How do I put it?
00:12:47.057,00:12:50.561,"Come on, kid. You don't expect us to buy your mercy horseshit."
00:12:50.644,00:12:55.357,I think what Agent Tench means is-- I think I've had enough science for one day.
00:12:57.485,00:12:58.694,Throat's a little dry.
00:13:33.103,00:13:35.439,-Maybe next time you should be careful-- -Holden.
00:13:35.523,00:13:38.150,-I didn't say anything. -You don't have to. I get it.
00:13:38.234,00:13:40.361,-Let's move on. -I wasn't going to reprimand you.
00:13:40.444,00:13:41.737,I hope not.
00:13:43.030,00:13:44.406,"Okay, we're moving on."
00:13:59.296,00:14:02.383,Monte Rissell danced around a bunch of psychiatrists when he was a kid.
00:14:02.466,00:14:04.343,Did the same thing when he was on parole.
00:14:04.426,00:14:06.595,He's an Olympic-class bullshitter.
00:14:07.137,00:14:09.098,Why do we think he's being honest with us?
00:14:09.181,00:14:12.726,But we don't think he's being completely honest. Do we?
00:14:13.727,00:14:17.147,We just need to extract what's useful and discard the rest.
00:14:17.231,00:14:19.149,So my mistake with Rissell was what?
00:14:27.241,00:14:29.743,-You okay? -Yeah.
00:14:34.373,00:14:37.626,Jesus Christ! What the fuck's the matter with you?
00:14:37.710,00:14:39.295,"What were you doing, 80, 100?!"
00:14:39.378,00:14:41.547,-You turned without looking! -You were speeding!
00:14:41.630,00:14:43.591,-Doesn't matter! I had the right of way! -Doesn't matter?
00:14:43.674,00:14:46.051,"-That's the law, buddy. -The law?!"
00:14:46.135,00:14:48.804,"-No. Here's the fucking law, pal! -You can't do that."
00:14:48.888,00:14:49.889,I'm gonna call the police!
00:14:50.556,00:14:52.182,"Stay away from me, man!"
00:14:54.685,00:14:56.103,Unbelievable!
00:15:02.359,00:15:03.736,You sure you're all right?
00:15:24.840,00:15:26.342,I completely understand.
00:15:27.927,00:15:29.887,Let me talk to Bill and I'll call you back.
00:15:39.188,00:15:40.356,Is that for me?
00:15:41.440,00:15:43.359,Thanks. Debbie says hi.
00:15:46.320,00:15:49.281,"It's fine. As soon as class is over, she'll come down."
00:15:50.741,00:15:54.119,She says she'd rather us get a room so she can pick us up in the morning.
00:15:56.956,00:15:58.123,I'm a little ticked off.
00:15:58.207,00:16:02.670,"I get Debbie doesn't want to do all that driving, but we have a situation here. I'm asking her for help."
00:16:04.046,00:16:06.840,"Okay, she's got midterms and that's on her mind, but..."
00:16:10.427,00:16:11.720,Why am I so upset?
00:16:13.389,00:16:16.058,Maybe 'cause she can't drop everything when you call.
00:16:18.519,00:16:20.020,Because she doesn't want to.
00:16:29.947,00:16:31.323,You want to call Nancy?
00:16:45.838,00:16:47.006,Are you okay?
00:16:49.758,00:16:50.759,Or we could just eat.
00:16:56.015,00:16:57.725,"I didn't see it coming, Holden."
00:16:58.851,00:17:01.770,"You could've been killed, and I didn't see it coming."
00:17:07.317,00:17:09.236,It's one thing if it's the job.
00:17:13.741,00:17:19.997,"I think if I called Nancy, if I heard her voice, I'd just lose it."
00:17:25.085,00:17:26.628,"You know, we adopted a boy..."
00:17:28.005,00:17:29.214,three years ago.
00:17:30.049,00:17:31.216,He's six now.
00:17:34.053,00:17:35.721,Nancy always wanted a family.
00:17:36.972,00:17:38.474,"And I guess I did, too."
00:17:41.143,00:17:44.146,"But we can't have kids of our own, so..."
00:17:45.397,00:17:46.815,It's not going well.
00:17:48.567,00:17:50.110,He's a beautiful boy.
00:17:52.237,00:17:57.493,"At first, I thought he was just quiet, you know, a quiet baby, nothing wrong with that."
00:17:59.119,00:18:03.457,"He can speak, he just won't."
00:18:06.251,00:18:08.170,I feel like we're failing him somehow.
00:18:11.048,00:18:12.174,I'm sure you're not.
00:18:13.342,00:18:15.177,Maybe he was like this before.
00:18:16.678,00:18:17.805,But it's a real strain.
00:18:20.015,00:18:22.976,"It's supposed to be this great thing, having a son."
00:18:23.060,00:18:24.019,"God, Bill."
00:18:25.145,00:18:27.147,I'm sorry to hear that.
00:18:27.231,00:18:29.233,"When the car was spinning out, I just..."
00:18:33.403,00:18:35.572,"You have no idea what I'm trying to say, do you?"
00:18:36.448,00:18:37.741,Not exactly...
00:18:40.202,00:18:41.453,but I want to.
00:18:41.537,00:18:42.579,I don't know either.
00:18:43.622,00:18:45.165,"It's nothing, it's fine."
00:18:45.624,00:18:46.875,"Seriously, Bill..."
00:18:47.376,00:18:48.502,Call Debbie.
00:18:49.670,00:18:51.547,Tell her she can come get us in the morning.
00:19:08.772,00:19:10.858,You don't expect us to buy your mercy horseshit.
00:19:28.584,00:19:30.544,"-Well, should we hear it again? -Eventually, yeah."
00:19:33.297,00:19:38.135,"Okay. So there are two triggers, one right after the other, for Rissell."
00:19:38.218,00:19:40.095,Maybe trigger is the wrong word. Too facile.
00:19:40.179,00:19:42.306,"Also, in law enforcement, has more than one meaning."
00:19:42.389,00:19:44.933,What about stresses? Stressors.
00:19:45.726,00:19:47.186,Let's make that our term of art.
00:19:47.269,00:19:50.063,Stress is more internal anyway. It's more appropriate to our focus.
00:19:50.147,00:19:51.982,"So, two stressors set Rissell off?"
00:19:52.065,00:19:53.567,"Her letter, obviously."
00:19:53.650,00:19:57.613,"So, the girlfriend writes him a Dear John letter and he-- Rissell cracks."
00:19:57.696,00:20:00.657,"-But he doesn't call her or write back. -No, he goes down there."
00:20:02.910,00:20:06.788,"He doesn't kill the girlfriend, he only watches her with her new beau."
00:20:06.997,00:20:08.248,-Big difference. -Beau?
00:20:08.332,00:20:11.001,So what if Rissell doesn't mean to kill anyone at this point?
00:20:11.084,00:20:17.299,"He's still on track for rape, but it's this first victim's compliance that just kind of pushes him over the edge."
00:20:17.382,00:20:19.760,He kills the first one because she likes it or pretends to?
00:20:21.220,00:20:22.554,Her compliance makes him angry.
00:20:22.638,00:20:24.681,"He throws her out of the car, she tries to escape."
00:20:24.765,00:20:27.726,"Where is it? He says, The whole thing is just fucking chaos."
00:20:27.809,00:20:30.354,-He needed to reassert control. -Exactly.
00:20:31.063,00:20:33.941,Which means that the victim's behavior is also a stressor.
00:20:34.524,00:20:39.196,"I mean, it may be that they can't change the ultimate outcome, but they can affect when and how it happens."
00:20:39.279,00:20:42.074,"Exactly what I was thinking, which is why I asked the question."
00:20:43.909,00:20:44.952,But what?
00:20:45.035,00:20:46.453,Isn't that just life?
00:20:47.037,00:20:48.205,Your girlfriend dumps you?
00:20:48.288,00:20:50.749,"You're trying to be intimate with someone, and it goes wrong?"
00:20:50.832,00:20:54.169,"Obviously, not that wrong, but it seems like Rissell just couldn't hack life."
00:20:54.253,00:20:57.714,"Well, what else is a criminal except somebody who can't function in society?"
00:20:57.798,00:21:04.471,"If we want to be reductive, we can say these men can't handle normal stages of development-- Why do I get the sense reductive is your worst insult?"
00:21:04.554,00:21:06.682,Not at all. I meant to say you were right.
00:21:08.350,00:21:14.523,How would most men feel if they were being intimate with a woman and they sensed that she wasn't enjoying herself?
00:21:17.985,00:21:19.236,"Come on, be scientists."
00:21:20.821,00:21:21.822,Disappointed.
00:21:22.447,00:21:24.950,-It would feel awful. -Right.
00:21:25.033,00:21:26.660,You want her to have a good time.
00:21:29.579,00:21:31.290,it turned him into a murderer.
00:21:31.832,00:21:35.836,"So, yes, what happens to these men is normal, but the way that they process it is not."
00:21:35.919,00:21:39.214,"That's our goal, to dig into the why, like you did with Kemper."
00:21:41.216,00:21:43.927,"We'll try and see Rissell again when we get back, if he'll see us."
00:21:44.011,00:21:47.306,This is gonna take twice as long if you can't do the interviews full-time.
00:21:48.015,00:21:52.144,"What is it? A question of money, of institutional rigidity, scheduling, what?"
00:21:52.227,00:21:53.395,All of the above.
00:22:09.745,00:22:11.079,"Honey, I gotta go."
00:22:18.378,00:22:20.047,Give your father a hug.
00:22:20.505,00:22:21.673,Say goodbye.
00:23:00.253,00:23:01.213,Ready?
00:23:01.922,00:23:03.048,Yep.
00:23:14.768,00:23:16.019,"No, it's not."
00:23:16.895,00:23:18.772,"So you're not from the East Coast, originally?"
00:23:23.819,00:23:24.736,What?
00:23:25.737,00:23:28.073,"I'm sorry, I missed that. I'm a little deaf."
00:23:28.532,00:23:31.159,I was just asking if you consider yourself an East Coaster?
00:23:31.243,00:23:32.786,You don't have that in your file?
00:23:34.871,00:23:36.832,"You were born in Wellington, South Kansas."
00:23:36.915,00:23:39.960,"You're the youngest of three, and your parents divorced when you were seven."
00:23:40.043,00:23:43.255,"That's all in the file, just not what you have to say about it."
00:23:43.463,00:23:46.007,"Yeah, my mom blamed that on me. No idea why."
00:23:46.883,00:23:51.680,"My brother and sister were around, but it was always on me when things went bad."
00:23:51.763,00:23:54.349,"Pretty soon after, Mom up and married Hank."
00:23:55.684,00:23:58.436,-Dragged us out to Sacramento. -You wanted to stay in Kansas?
00:24:00.647,00:24:03.608,"I did not want to be in California, that's for sure."
00:24:05.652,00:24:06.987,"Nobody wanted me there, either."
00:24:07.696,00:24:09.823,Did your mother say she didn't want you there?
00:24:16.121,00:24:17.789,Why you always want to do that after?
00:24:19.207,00:24:20.083,Crush the can.
00:24:21.001,00:24:21.835,It feels good.
00:24:23.086,00:24:23.920,"Yeah, maybe."
00:24:24.004,00:24:26.506,What made you think nobody wanted you in California?
00:24:28.758,00:24:32.804,"And Hank didn't want to raise somebody else's kids, so he bought us shit."
00:24:33.430,00:24:38.310,"Thought that'd be enough. When I was seven, he bought me a gun."
00:24:39.477,00:24:41.563,-He bought you a gun? -BB gun.
00:24:42.981,00:24:47.986,"My brother and sister were drinking, smoking a lot of weed, doing all kinds of shit."
00:24:49.571,00:24:51.031,Sometimes they'd share.
00:24:52.115,00:24:55.035,"When I was nine, I shot my cousin in the ass with that gun."
00:24:55.118,00:24:58.830,"That made me star of the show. I mean, everybody fucking hated my cousin."
00:24:58.914,00:25:01.041,So you kids were left all alone.
00:25:01.750,00:25:03.835,Hank broke the fucking thing over my head.
00:25:06.713,00:25:07.839,It's how I burst my eardrum.
00:25:14.471,00:25:17.515,"Broke into some lady's house, stole a hundred bucks."
00:25:18.141,00:25:21.728,"Mom and Hank divorced when I was 12, that was kind of my doing."
00:25:22.604,00:25:25.148,"Fourteen, things got a little worse."
00:25:25.232,00:25:28.860,"Burglary, larceny, car theft, rape twice."
00:25:29.569,00:25:31.947,My mom somehow got them to send me to Florida.
00:25:32.989,00:25:34.241,"Thanks, Ma!"
00:25:36.660,00:25:41.373,"I get back. I'm 17, living on my own, working double shifts at Pizza Hut."
00:25:43.833,00:25:44.876,"Nobody wanted me, man."
00:25:47.379,00:25:49.965,Nobody on this earth ever wanted me.
00:25:51.424,00:25:53.468,Put that on your fucking tape.
00:25:55.553,00:25:57.889,If only they'd let me stay with my dad...
00:25:58.723,00:26:00.141,it'd all be different.
00:26:01.393,00:26:02.936,I might even be a lawyer.
00:26:06.898,00:26:08.066,House.
00:26:08.858,00:26:12.195,Be out in the backyard perfecting my recipe for barbecue.
00:26:15.532,00:26:16.658,I'd have found my way.
00:26:33.258,00:26:35.260,So Rissell's the real victim here?
00:26:35.969,00:26:37.762,"That's how he sees it, sure."
00:26:38.513,00:26:42.809,A pathological liar who murdered five women sees himself as the victim.
00:26:44.102,00:26:46.563,And we're giving him a shoulder to cry on.
00:26:49.232,00:26:51.443,We're not flattering him. Or helping him.
00:26:53.069,00:26:54.279,We're using him.
00:27:02.912,00:27:03.913,"Yeah, okay."
00:27:09.461,00:27:12.756,"The three pillars of criminal investigation: what, why, who."
00:27:12.839,00:27:13.965,What happened...
00:27:14.549,00:27:18.762,"When I'm involved in a hostage negotiation, the perpetrator is standing right in front of me."
00:27:31.399,00:27:33.318,-Not a bad group tonight. -Yeah.
00:27:39.991,00:27:42.202,"Look at him just standing there, watching us."
00:27:42.285,00:27:44.871,He's just having a cigarette before he heads home.
00:27:49.000,00:27:51.211,See how he's deliberately trying not to look at us?
00:27:51.294,00:27:53.338,He's screwing up the nerve to approach.
00:27:53.421,00:27:56.841,-I put the over-under at half a minute. -I'll definitely take under.
00:27:57.467,00:27:59.052,-That's a bet. -Loser buys dinner.
00:28:02.013,00:28:03.473,"Look out, he's on the move."
00:28:09.062,00:28:09.979,Hey.
00:28:11.564,00:28:13.483,You guys mind if I bother you a minute?
00:28:13.566,00:28:14.692,Sure. What's up?
00:28:15.693,00:28:17.529,"Beverly Jean Shaw, 22."
00:28:19.030,00:28:20.740,Never came home from her babysitting job.
00:28:20.824,00:28:24.077,"Four days later, we find her in the dump on Wopsononock Mountain."
00:28:25.495,00:28:30.583,"Um, based on stomach contents, we think she was killed right away, around midnight Wednesday."
00:28:32.252,00:28:34.671,She was sitting like this at the dump for four days?
00:28:34.754,00:28:36.548,"Well, no, um..."
00:28:38.174,00:28:40.093,"See, there wasn't enough, um..."
00:28:41.219,00:28:45.890,If she had been at the dump four days-- We'd see more insect infestation and animal trauma.
00:28:46.641,00:28:51.813,"So, between when she was murdered on Wednesday and the body was discovered four days later, she had to be someplace else?"
00:28:56.526,00:28:59.612,"They were, I guess you'd say... amputated."
00:29:00.613,00:29:04.325,"-Um, we have not been able to locate them. -Was this postmortem or..."
00:29:09.372,00:29:12.292,"broke her jaw, multiple stab wounds."
00:29:12.751,00:29:15.795,You can see he kind of frogged her legs out there.
00:29:18.882,00:29:20.216,"And there was, um..."
00:29:31.728,00:29:32.729,Sorry.
00:29:34.355,00:29:35.774,We don't get this kind of thing.
00:29:35.857,00:29:37.108,-It's hard to-- -Take your time.
00:29:46.868,00:29:50.622,"From her vagina to her, um... anus."
00:29:52.999,00:29:55.210,-God damn it. I'm sorry. -You're doing fine.
00:29:56.669,00:29:58.379,-The family local? -Uh...
00:29:58.463,00:29:59.756,Parents upstate. Fiancé in town.
00:30:02.509,00:30:05.887,-You don't think somebody local did this? -Hard to say at this point.
00:30:06.596,00:30:08.431,I go to church with these people.
00:30:08.515,00:30:11.184,"We get peeping Toms, sure. But something like this?"
00:30:11.267,00:30:12.727,It doesn't make sense.
00:30:12.811,00:30:16.898,To go from shoplifters and underage kids buying beer to...
00:30:19.234,00:30:22.153,what happened to Beverly... Has to be an outsider.
00:30:22.237,00:30:24.989,"Draped over the ironing board here, is that human hair?"
00:30:27.742,00:30:28.743,You have it?
00:30:30.537,00:30:31.454,Sure.
00:30:31.871,00:30:33.540,"Yeah, Forensics bagged it up."
00:30:33.957,00:30:36.334,It's all about Forensics. I am starting to appreciate that.
00:30:38.711,00:30:42.173,"Uh, I mean, we dusted it for fingerprints and everything, but, uh..."
00:30:43.758,00:30:47.512,But you do think the unsub scalped Beverly and then draped it over the ironing board?
00:30:48.847,00:30:49.764,That mean something?
00:30:51.766,00:30:53.101,Everything in this photo has meaning.
00:30:53.184,00:30:55.854,"If the unsub meant to display the hair, he was saying something."
00:30:55.937,00:30:59.274,"-He could've put the hair anywhere. -Right, no, I get it now. Uh..."
00:30:59.357,00:31:02.527,"Soon as Forensics confirms it's Beverly's hair-- I'm sorry, what?"
00:31:02.861,00:31:05.113,"Well, we shouldn't jump ahead of Forensics, am I right?"
00:31:08.741,00:31:17.458,"a big chunk of hair nearby, so we can go out on a limb and assume-- I think what Agent Ford is trying to say, in his own way, is we're behind the eight ball here, we've come late to the party."
00:31:17.542,00:31:21.379,"We're gonna have to go over ground you've covered: witnesses, crime scene."
00:31:21.462,00:31:24.716,We don't mean that as a challenge to you. It's not any kind of a criticism.
00:31:24.799,00:31:27.135,"We're just trying to catch up. Am I right, Agent Ford?"
00:31:30.847,00:31:31.931,Absolutely.
00:31:32.015,00:31:35.268,We may ask some obvious questions and maybe a few you haven't thought of.
00:31:35.351,00:31:38.938,But it's not a contest or a competition. We're all on the same side.
00:31:40.064,00:31:41.357,-Okay? -Sure.
00:31:41.858,00:31:43.401,Let's go through the rest.
00:31:43.484,00:31:46.321,I'm curious why you're cutting this guy so much slack.
00:31:46.404,00:31:50.241,He's never seen this kind of thing before. He's rattled. It's not his fault.
00:31:51.576,00:31:55.580,"Without a doubt you have more experience, but why rub it in his face?"
00:31:56.831,00:31:58.875,I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
00:31:58.958,00:32:00.001,Maybe a little.
00:32:00.084,00:32:04.047,"The point is, local cops want to catch their guy as much as we do, maybe more."
00:32:04.130,00:32:07.050,"For them, it's not just theoretical, it's where they live."
00:32:16.893,00:32:18.519,This is where your focus should be.
00:32:19.145,00:32:23.191,"Not on the crime scene, not on the corpse, not on the schematics."
00:32:25.109,00:32:26.444,Focus on Beverly.
00:32:29.030,00:32:31.616,"We've learned that this is a crucial detail, and not the only one."
00:32:31.699,00:32:36.537,"Based on the facts Detective Ocasek laid out earlier, our methodology tells us we're looking for a white male."
00:32:36.621,00:32:38.957,These crimes rarely cross racial lines.
00:32:39.040,00:32:41.084,He's probably around Beverly's age.
00:32:41.167,00:32:44.003,A killer will usually choose someone smaller and weaker than himself.
00:32:44.087,00:32:46.381,"He's a loner, hunts at night."
00:32:46.714,00:32:49.425,"I'm sorry, hunts? Is that a figure of speech?"
00:32:50.343,00:32:51.177,It is not.
00:32:51.260,00:32:54.597,Coroner's report said Beverly was killed and then butchered.
00:32:54.681,00:32:55.974,Isn't that what hunters do?
00:32:56.808,00:32:58.810,We're probably looking for a loner.
00:33:00.019,00:33:04.732,"These men like to explore the fantasy first, bondage pornography, hardcore material."
00:33:04.816,00:33:07.652,It gives them a certain... attitude towards women.
00:33:07.735,00:33:09.112,"Hence, a loner."
00:33:09.195,00:33:12.031,"Close-knit community like this, you would've spotted that by now."
00:33:12.115,00:33:14.492,"I think our man is an outsider, probably a drifter."
00:33:14.575,00:33:17.370,"Most likely, he'll move on from here and kill again."
00:33:17.453,00:33:18.788,Again?
00:33:36.806,00:33:40.435,The killer thought of Beverly Jean as just another piece of trash.
00:33:41.561,00:33:44.939,Folks loved Beverly Jean. Trusted her with their kids.
00:33:46.441,00:33:48.359,"Had to be a drifter, like you say."
00:33:50.611,00:33:52.363,All that pretty hair caught his eye.
00:33:52.447,00:33:54.907,"He needed to possess it, then destroy it."
00:33:58.286,00:34:01.122,There's only so much you can get out of a man in that state.
00:34:02.081,00:34:05.460,Benjamin was still in shock. Gotta take all that into account.
00:34:05.543,00:34:09.172,"Well, I'm sure you know your people, but let's just cover our bases."
00:34:09.255,00:34:12.550,And let's try to get him cold. Make some excuse when you call.
00:34:13.134,00:34:15.511,"Don't mention the FBI, or even the murder."
00:34:15.595,00:34:17.597,Help us get an unguarded response.
00:34:18.181,00:34:19.682,Soon as Benjamin gets back into town.
00:34:19.766,00:34:22.310,-Back into town? -You let the fiancé leave?
00:34:22.393,00:34:24.854,He went up north for a bit to be with his relatives.
00:34:24.937,00:34:27.315,You need to be with family at times like this.
00:34:27.398,00:34:30.151,He'll be back soon. I'll vouch for that.
00:34:32.945,00:34:33.988,He'll be back.
00:34:47.460,00:34:48.753,Where was the body found?
00:35:01.432,00:35:05.561,Right. I'll have a couple of the boys come pick it up. Sorry about that.
00:35:05.645,00:35:09.232,No apology necessary. We're all learning as we go.
00:35:12.735,00:35:14.987,You can see why I went easy on the fiancé.
00:35:16.531,00:35:18.407,Ugly end for someone you just proposed to.
00:35:20.660,00:35:21.744,"Couple months, I think."
00:35:23.079,00:35:24.497,Could be he felt trapped.
00:35:24.580,00:35:26.249,"By a pretty, young blonde?"
00:35:26.874,00:35:28.376,Remember what Wendy said?
00:35:29.252,00:35:31.170,"A colleague of ours, a psychologist."
00:35:31.254,00:35:34.841,Events we process as good news sometimes hit these killers the wrong way.
00:35:34.924,00:35:36.717,Huh. That's interesting.
00:35:38.886,00:35:42.181,"A welder, Alvin Moran, out taking his dog for a hike."
00:35:42.765,00:35:44.559,-At the dump? -He have an alibi?
00:35:45.143,00:35:48.146,Alibi? He came to us. Why's he need an alibi?
00:35:48.229,00:35:51.315,Sometimes the killer will insinuate himself into the investigation.
00:35:56.404,00:35:57.405,Yeah.
00:36:10.626,00:36:11.627,Excuse me!
00:36:13.421,00:36:14.255,Mr. Moran?
00:36:16.924,00:36:18.259,Mr. Moran?
00:36:25.474,00:36:27.018,"You remember me, Mr. Moran?"
00:36:27.393,00:36:30.521,These men from the FBI would like to talk to you. That all right?
00:36:30.605,00:36:31.522,Great.
00:36:32.607,00:36:35.026,We're told you found Beverly Jean's body.
00:36:35.318,00:36:37.361,How'd you happen to find yourself at the dump?
00:36:37.820,00:36:40.281,Hiking. Wopsononock Mountain.
00:36:41.324,00:36:42.992,"Like to take the trail, clear my head."
00:36:45.620,00:36:48.331,Get up there a few times a week. Take the dog for a walk.
00:36:50.917,00:36:53.252,-The path comes in pretty close. -Does it?
00:36:53.794,00:36:56.839,"You see any sign of a hiking trail out by the dump, Bill?"
00:36:56.923,00:36:59.050,"The other side of the railroad tracks, up the hill."
00:36:59.467,00:37:01.928,Looks like a bunch of trees from where you're standing.
00:37:02.345,00:37:04.805,But if there's no clear view from the dump to the trail...
00:37:04.889,00:37:06.390,Are you really FBI?
00:37:07.558,00:37:08.726,Am I under suspicion here?
00:37:12.897,00:37:13.814,Okay.
00:37:15.775,00:37:19.445,"So I come off the trail to take a piss, no law against it."
00:37:19.528,00:37:21.948,"There may be, actually, but let's leave that for now."
00:37:22.031,00:37:24.992,"You go to take a piss, you see Beverly Jean's body..."
00:37:25.660,00:37:27.745,I thought it was a store mannequin or something.
00:37:27.828,00:37:29.664,Wouldn't your dog have gone straight for it?
00:37:29.747,00:37:32.124,"-Might have, but that's not what happened. -What kind of dog?"
00:37:32.667,00:37:35.086,-Retriever. -And he didn't sniff it out first?
00:37:35.711,00:37:36.754,That seems odd.
00:37:41.425,00:37:44.428,"I took care of my business, I collected my dog, and I went to the police."
00:37:45.012,00:37:47.098,Right away? Few hours later? Next day?
00:37:47.181,00:37:49.100,Couple hours later. Maybe that night.
00:37:50.017,00:37:52.019,"It was actually morning when you came in, sir."
00:37:58.776,00:38:02.822,"You're talking to the FBI, Mr. Moran. If we want to find something out, we will."
00:38:05.908,00:38:08.786,"I was scared the cops might want me for it, okay?"
00:38:09.412,00:38:12.123,My wife talked me out of that. I did my duty as a citizen.
00:38:12.373,00:38:14.375,You thought they'd want you for a murder?
00:38:14.834,00:38:17.461,"I seen cops get desperate, grab whoever they can get."
00:38:19.797,00:38:21.841,"I got a bit of a record, all right?"
00:38:22.550,00:38:26.387,"It ain't much. I lit up a few fires when I was a kid, got into a few fights."
00:38:26.762,00:38:27.888,I ain't proud of it.
00:38:27.972,00:38:29.473,"Came here, met my wife."
00:38:30.933,00:38:34.145,"-Family man now. -Before that, did you move around a lot?"
00:38:47.825,00:38:50.161,"I come into town, grab a beer now and then."
00:38:53.539,00:38:55.666,I seen Beverly Jean a few times.
00:38:55.750,00:38:57.710,You saw Beverly Jean at a bar?
00:38:58.586,00:38:59.503,At The Kettle.
00:39:04.592,00:39:05.843,To buy her a drink.
00:39:08.054,00:39:10.014,"She wasn't interested, end of story."
00:39:13.017,00:39:14.685,Maybe I asked her more than once.
00:39:14.769,00:39:18.064,"More than once that night at the bar, or on more than one occasion?"
00:39:18.731,00:39:21.025,I guess you'd say on more than one occasion.
00:39:28.157,00:39:29.742,Beverly Jean rejected him.
00:39:29.825,00:39:32.620,He's got a record. He tried to help the police.
00:39:32.703,00:39:36.207,And his alibi? Home watching TV with the wife?
00:39:36.290,00:39:40.211,"If a man like that took Beverly Jean, he'd draw it out, make her suffer."
00:39:40.294,00:39:42.505,"You saw the photos, he must've tortured her for hours."
00:39:45.091,00:39:47.426,You said that before. What difference does that make?
00:39:48.803,00:39:51.138,"When you're married, it's a contract."
00:39:51.555,00:39:56.310,"There's children, a mortgage, a house to keep up, almost like a business."
00:39:57.269,00:40:00.231,Only you can't quit. She can't fire you.
00:40:00.314,00:40:02.024,"Stock goes up, stock goes down..."
00:40:02.108,00:40:03.567,"doesn't matter, you're trapped."
00:40:04.151,00:40:07.196,Unless you want to bring on the lawyers and open Pandora's box.
00:40:07.780,00:40:09.323,Resentment builds on both sides.
00:40:09.407,00:40:10.908,A thousand tiny cuts.
00:40:11.784,00:40:16.247,"If Alvin Moran had a married man's anger, he'd have tortured, then killed her."
00:40:17.164,00:40:18.416,No question in my mind.
00:40:20.584,00:40:23.921,Maybe we should talk to his wife. See if there's anything there.
00:40:25.798,00:40:27.174,"I mean, she's the whole alibi."
00:40:28.801,00:40:30.970,Wouldn't mind checking it holds up.
00:40:35.558,00:40:37.601,"Mrs. Moran, thank you for coming in."
00:40:37.685,00:40:40.938,"My name is Bill Tench. This is my partner, Holden Ford."
00:40:41.021,00:40:42.022,Hello.
00:40:44.817,00:40:46.735,I don't understand. I can't call my husband?
00:40:46.819,00:40:50.698,"-Aren't I supposed to get my phone call? -You're not under arrest, Mrs. Moran."
00:40:50.781,00:40:52.074,These men are from the FBI.
00:40:52.158,00:40:54.076,They just want to ask you a couple questions.
00:40:54.160,00:40:56.120,Have you been following the investigation?
00:40:59.290,00:41:01.750,Can't look at that. Poor girl.
00:41:03.502,00:41:05.463,-Wouldn't hurt a fly. -You knew her?
00:41:07.047,00:41:08.674,Can we ask how you knew her?
00:41:16.098,00:41:16.932,Mrs. Moran?
00:41:19.059,00:41:20.644,We talked with her about it.
00:41:27.401,00:41:28.235,Meaning?
00:41:29.445,00:41:30.571,You know what I mean.
00:41:30.654,00:41:32.531,"It's best if we don't have to guess, ma'am."
00:41:35.659,00:41:39.163,"She was young, and skinny, and..."
00:41:40.414,00:41:42.333,"Oh, such pretty blonde hair."
00:41:43.959,00:41:45.836,Didn't need that in my house.
00:41:46.337,00:41:48.380,Not with two little kids in the picture.
00:41:49.381,00:41:50.424,What do I look like?
00:41:51.342,00:41:56.639,Were you aware that your husband made overtures to Beverly on several occasions?
00:41:56.722,00:41:59.350,Didn't I just say he had a thing for the poor girl?
00:42:02.770,00:42:04.271,Alvin does this.
00:42:05.147,00:42:09.235,It's like sportfishing. He doesn't mean anything by it.
00:42:09.318,00:42:12.863,We were told he was home with you watching television the night Beverly disappeared.
00:42:16.408,00:42:18.202,You think Alvin did this?
00:42:20.955,00:42:23.832,Oh! No.
00:42:25.334,00:42:32.967,"I mean, I'd love for him to get a good scare, bothering a girl half his age, but... no."
00:42:34.468,00:42:35.886,The idiot was with me.
00:42:36.428,00:42:37.429,The whole night?
00:42:38.180,00:42:39.265,The whole night.
00:42:48.107,00:42:49.567,But so are a million other men.
00:42:49.650,00:42:51.819,I don't see any of the anger you've been talking about.
00:42:51.902,00:42:53.904,"So lo and behold, we're back to the fiancé."
00:42:53.988,00:42:55.531,"Follow your own logic, Bill."
00:42:55.864,00:42:58.409,The anger makes no sense in a young couple either.
00:42:58.492,00:43:00.244,This could be the first in a sequence.
00:43:00.327,00:43:04.039,"Nine times out of ten, it's the boyfriend, the husband, somebody close."
00:43:04.123,00:43:05.749,"Nine times isn't every time, Bill."
00:43:05.833,00:43:06.834,"Listen, uh..."
00:43:08.210,00:43:10.462,Can't say how much I appreciate all your help.
00:43:10.796,00:43:13.674,Sorry if I got off a little shaky there at the start.
00:43:13.757,00:43:16.594,"I'm gonna stick with Alvin, if it's all the same, keep you posted."
00:43:23.559,00:43:26.020,A local detective asked for our help. What else could we do?
00:43:26.103,00:43:28.522,Tell them you have more important things to do with your time.
00:43:28.606,00:43:32.443,We've been consulting with local cops for years. No reason to change that now.
00:43:32.526,00:43:34.528,My assumption is you're good at your job.
00:43:34.612,00:43:38.991,Which means you're gonna be more focused on solving an actual crime than the theoretical work we're doing.
00:43:42.036,00:43:44.413,"We can't end crime, no matter what we do."
00:43:44.496,00:43:49.376,"But in the long run, I think that our project could have a deeper impact than solving a single murder."
00:43:49.460,00:43:51.545,We can do both. It's not an issue.
00:43:54.089,00:43:56.008,What jumped out when you were talking to Rissell?
00:43:56.091,00:43:58.093,He seems aware of the trap of his childhood.
00:43:58.177,00:44:00.971,How things might be different if he was allowed to stay with his dad.
00:44:01.055,00:44:02.139,Kemper said something similar.
00:44:02.222,00:44:04.600,"They're both playing the victim, looking for sympathy."
00:44:06.393,00:44:09.772,"I think you're both right. I mean, it's self-pity, absolutely."
00:44:09.855,00:44:12.733,And the psychopath understands how that plays to his audience.
00:44:12.816,00:44:17.404,-Exactly. -But the complicated part is that they actually believe it. They have to.
00:44:17.488,00:44:21.450,"I mean, if they admitted that they rape and murder for pleasure, it would destroy them."
00:44:22.451,00:44:23.535,There's a tension.
00:44:23.619,00:44:32.086,"They need to be seen to have power over someone, and yet circumstance demands that they erase the only witness, which means they have to do the whole thing over again."
00:44:32.628,00:44:33.545,It must be hell.
00:44:33.629,00:44:36.590,So the self-pity angle works. You have sympathy for both of them.
00:44:36.674,00:44:38.634,"Yeah, of course. How else could I do my job?"
00:44:39.760,00:44:42.096,Do Kemper and Rissell have other common traits?
00:44:42.179,00:44:44.973,"That what you're doing with these cards, figuring out similarities?"
00:44:45.057,00:44:47.518,And differences. I've been going through their files.
00:44:47.601,00:44:51.355,"I'm trying to frame an overall taxonomy, except I don't know where to start."
00:44:52.606,00:44:55.150,"Kemper's like a general, planning his campaigns."
00:44:55.234,00:44:57.653,-But Rissell-- -Didn't intend to kill his first victim.
00:44:57.736,00:45:00.614,All of his victims seem spontaneous. He just walks away when he's done.
00:45:00.697,00:45:04.910,"Kemper took photographs, and dissected the victims, and was very good at hiding the remains."
00:45:04.993,00:45:07.830,So could we say systematic and anti-systematic?
00:45:09.706,00:45:11.917,Something even a beat cop could understand straight away.
00:45:12.000,00:45:14.837,Right. Like organized and disorganized.
00:45:14.920,00:45:16.505,Okay. Let's try it.
00:45:16.588,00:45:17.464,What goes where?
00:45:18.966,00:45:19.925,Well...
00:45:20.676,00:45:24.221,High intelligence would go under organized.
00:45:24.596,00:45:27.057,Low intelligence: disorganized.
00:45:30.644,00:45:32.563,-What do you think? -Definitely.
00:45:32.646,00:45:36.024,"The class is great, but he's obsessed with the meaning of shit."
00:45:36.108,00:45:37.109,Does shit have meaning?
00:45:37.192,00:45:38.652,"All shit has meaning, man."
00:45:40.195,00:45:41.155,Is that her?
00:45:44.324,00:45:46.410,No. Wendy's more...
00:45:47.786,00:45:48.620,not that.
00:45:48.704,00:45:50.122,Look at you.
00:45:53.959,00:45:56.837,Would I have invited her to go out with us if I was interested in her?
00:45:56.920,00:45:59.089,I've seen men do stranger things.
00:45:59.548,00:46:01.967,-So she's married. -How does that follow?
00:46:02.050,00:46:04.595,"If you're not interested, she must be married."
00:46:05.053,00:46:09.057,"For a man who picks up strange women in bars, you have your scruples."
00:46:10.225,00:46:11.226,Thank you.
00:46:13.937,00:46:15.147,I don't think she is married.
00:46:16.064,00:46:17.065,That's her.
00:46:22.654,00:46:24.114,Do you plan on getting married?
00:46:24.198,00:46:26.033,"Having kids, the whole thing?"
00:46:27.367,00:46:29.703,"Are you proposing, Holden Ford?"
00:46:29.786,00:46:30.871,Just curious.
00:46:32.456,00:46:35.584,-Your parents have a good marriage? -I have no idea.
00:46:35.667,00:46:38.128,-Where's this coming from? -The study.
00:46:38.921,00:46:40.631,We're talking a lot about parents.
00:46:40.881,00:46:42.508,"Harsh mothers, absent fathers."
00:46:42.591,00:46:44.551,All fathers are absent fathers.
00:46:46.720,00:46:47.930,That's definitely her.
00:46:51.767,00:46:52.601,Hello.
00:46:53.810,00:46:54.770,Hi.
00:46:55.979,00:46:57.814,-Wendy Carr. -Deborah Mitford.
00:46:57.898,00:46:59.024,It's a pleasure.
00:46:59.107,00:47:02.277,"Thank you so much for the invitation. It was unexpected, but appreciated."
00:47:02.361,00:47:05.447,"Yeah, for a fed, he's not so bad at having a good time."
00:47:05.822,00:47:07.407,Are you in law enforcement also?
00:47:07.491,00:47:09.660,"No, I'm doing postgrad, actually."
00:47:09.743,00:47:12.120,-Sociology at UVA. -What's your concentration?
00:47:14.581,00:47:16.542,"-Yes. -Oh, God."
00:47:17.251,00:47:18.961,Because I didn't know who Durkheim was...
00:47:19.044,00:47:21.672,"-Or Goring, or Blumer. -It's fine."
00:47:22.172,00:47:25.092,I'm not intimidated being around women who are smarter than me.
00:47:25.759,00:47:28.178,"Men often say that, but they rarely mean it."
00:47:29.429,00:47:32.933,"He has a lot of flaws, but surprisingly, that's not one of them."
00:47:35.185,00:47:37.646,-I'm-- Excuse me. -Yes.
00:47:38.438,00:47:41.316,Could I get a Manhattan? And will you have another round?
00:47:42.025,00:47:43.360,"-Yeah, thank you. -Yeah."
00:47:46.071,00:47:49.366,"No, Andrea called. Said he wanted to meet with us."
00:47:49.449,00:47:51.118,Any idea what this is about?
00:47:51.201,00:47:54.371,"No. Usually, it's about finding clarity."
00:47:54.830,00:47:56.498,But he asked for me specifically?
00:47:56.582,00:47:57.749,All three of us.
00:48:22.316,00:48:26.194,"Dr. Carr, Unit Chief Shepard. Nice to meet you finally."
00:48:32.242,00:48:35.579,"So, how's everything? Progressing?"
00:48:37.581,00:48:38.957,"Uh, yes, thank you."
00:48:39.041,00:48:40.584,"-Fine, thanks. -Slowly, but yes."
00:48:40.667,00:48:41.793,Can I help with anything?
00:48:45.464,00:48:47.299,Is there anything I need to know?
00:48:49.968,00:48:52.554,"-Sir, if this is about the car-- -Nobody cares about the car."
00:48:52.638,00:48:55.599,It was insured and I assume driven by your protégé.
00:48:58.435,00:49:05.525,"Dr. Carr, I'm aware of your consulting with Bill over the years and your help framing certain psychological concepts with the BSU."
00:49:05.609,00:49:11.865,"Uh, yes, a handful of times. Special Agent Tench was-- I assume that meant you understood how things were done here at Quantico."
00:49:11.948,00:49:14.284,I assumed the same for your cohorts.
00:49:15.661,00:49:22.084,You might think it is my job to impede your progress with my insistence on timelines and established protocols.
00:49:22.167,00:49:24.044,"-No, sir. Not at all. -That is not my job."
00:49:24.127,00:49:27.297,My job is to provide guidance and quite a bit of protection.
00:49:27.964,00:49:29.966,-I don't understand. -Clearly.
00:49:32.135,00:49:36.848,You have stepped outside the shade of my umbrella and you are now exposed to direct sunlight.
00:49:37.307,00:49:41.728,I applied for grant money from several sources anticipating a response months from now.
00:49:41.812,00:49:47.317,"Much to my surprise, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration was already aware of our needs and activities."
00:49:47.401,00:49:50.529,"I see. I had no intention of embarrassing you, Unit Chief Shepard."
00:49:50.612,00:49:58.286,"I was at a fund-raiser for the university and I was talking to some-- Yes, talking to people outside the FBI about something you were not even supposed to be aware of."
00:49:58.370,00:50:01.957,The LEAA explained that the application was anticipated.
00:50:02.040,00:50:03.667,"How could that be, I wondered."
00:50:04.626,00:50:10.215,It seems they know more about what's going on in our basement than I was comfortable including in the application.
00:50:10.298,00:50:13.260,"-I so apologize. It-- -Sir, this is my fault."
00:50:13.343,00:50:15.512,"Your research has been awarded $200,000."
00:50:19.224,00:50:21.435,"As I said, I applied to more than one place for funding."
00:50:21.518,00:50:29.943,"The National Institute of Justice heard about the LEAA, and they are in competition, so the NIJ has awarded you an additional $185,000."
00:50:30.026,00:50:30.861,You can't be serious.
00:50:30.944,00:50:33.822,This amount of money comes with considerable scrutiny.
00:50:34.156,00:50:38.952,"And I'm not talking about bookkeeping, although you will certainly be required to keep meticulous records."
00:50:39.035,00:50:43.623,I'm talking about Congress having a real interest in everything we do.
00:50:43.707,00:50:47.419,So much for the protection I might have afforded you.
00:50:48.295,00:50:50.380,"Congratulations, I suppose."
00:50:51.757,00:50:53.091,Have a nice day.
00:02:17.929,00:02:20.223,"Came back to town, just like I told you he would."
00:02:20.306,00:02:22.725,Benji was home watching TV the night Beverly Jean was killed?
00:02:22.809,00:02:24.936,That's what he told us and I believe him.
00:02:25.436,00:02:28.106,"He let us search his car, no warrant."
00:02:28.189,00:02:33.570,"And we didn't find a thing except for some of Beverly Jean's hair, but in the passenger seat, like you'd expect it."
00:02:33.653,00:02:37.198,"Passenger seat's not the best way to transport a corpse, I'll give you that."
00:02:37.657,00:02:40.201,But you said he was home alone watching TV?
00:02:43.580,00:02:46.124,Isn't that what most people do most nights of the week?
00:02:46.207,00:02:48.167,Benjamin is definitely most people.
00:02:48.251,00:02:51.546,"He's worked the same job ever since high school, bagging groceries at the A&amp;P."
00:02:51.629,00:02:55.008,Works at the A&amp;P? Does he have access to a delivery vehicle?
00:02:55.091,00:02:56.926,Nope. Only works the floor.
00:03:19.324,00:03:20.700,Is he expecting us?
00:03:21.659,00:03:24.120,"He's in mourning, I thought it'd be polite to let him know."
00:03:24.203,00:03:25.622,We should've brought a six pack.
00:03:35.381,00:03:37.008,-Can I get you some coffee? -Sure.
00:03:40.386,00:03:41.221,I'll wait.
00:03:43.389,00:03:44.641,Uh...
00:03:44.724,00:03:48.102,"I got some donuts, too. Half glazed, half cake."
00:03:50.521,00:03:52.565,"I'd love a donut. Thanks, Benjamin."
00:03:53.983,00:03:55.818,"Thanks for meeting with us, Mr. Barnwright."
00:03:55.902,00:03:56.861,Benjamin.
00:03:56.945,00:03:59.614,"I'm Bill Tench, this is Holden Ford. We're with the FBI."
00:03:59.697,00:04:01.783,He told me you'll be helping with the case.
00:04:01.866,00:04:03.660,We're sorry about your girlfriend.
00:04:07.747,00:04:09.707,So this was pretty serious.
00:04:09.791,00:04:11.668,We just got engaged.
00:04:14.295,00:04:17.423,-I knew she was it when I met her. -How'd you know?
00:04:17.507,00:04:20.760,"Uh, we saw things the same way."
00:04:24.055,00:04:27.225,You play sports in high school? I'm guessing not the football team.
00:04:28.184,00:04:29.978,-Band? Debate? -No.
00:04:30.520,00:04:31.729,Then what did you do?
00:04:32.647,00:04:35.650,"Uh, I... nothing."
00:04:38.695,00:04:41.739,"Well, you're doing good now. Got your own place and everything."
00:04:42.532,00:04:44.617,Got this place for Beverly Jean.
00:04:48.079,00:04:49.914,I wanted us to have some privacy.
00:04:50.373,00:04:51.708,Where were you before?
00:04:52.125,00:04:54.127,A few blocks over on Chestnut.
00:04:54.210,00:04:56.337,"-With your family? -Uh, with my mom."
00:04:56.421,00:04:59.299,"It must have been hard on her, seeing you leave home."
00:04:59.382,00:05:02.468,I think she was happy to see me move on.
00:05:03.886,00:05:07.181,She loved Beverly Jean as much as I did.
00:05:07.265,00:05:10.643,"Mrs. Barnwright goes to my church, too. First United Methodist."
00:05:11.519,00:05:13.146,So you two know each other from church?
00:05:13.229,00:05:15.023,Yeah. You and Rose.
00:05:15.106,00:05:18.860,Mostly by sight now. I don't go much anymore.
00:05:19.319,00:05:22.613,Was your mother a disciplinarian?
00:05:22.697,00:05:24.240,You mean strict?
00:05:27.160,00:05:28.828,Uh...
00:05:28.911,00:05:30.288,She just cried.
00:05:30.830,00:05:33.583,"Well, I'm sure it was difficult raising two kids without a dad."
00:05:33.666,00:05:35.251,"Yeah, he split when I was ten."
00:05:35.960,00:05:38.880,-What was your father like? -I don't much remember him.
00:05:39.839,00:05:41.466,You and Beverly Jean ever fight?
00:05:46.763,00:05:48.056,Sometimes.
00:05:50.433,00:05:52.060,Just stupid stuff.
00:05:52.518,00:05:53.811,Like what?
00:05:53.895,00:05:55.104,"Like, uh..."
00:05:56.189,00:05:57.607,what movie to go to.
00:06:02.320,00:06:04.572,You got this place for her? Did she like it?
00:06:06.699,00:06:07.784,"She, uh..."
00:06:09.744,00:06:13.247,She wanted to make it pretty when she moved in.
00:06:14.624,00:06:16.375,"-After the wedding. -Traditional, huh?"
00:06:19.462,00:06:21.714,That was just to keep it proper.
00:06:22.381,00:06:24.217,Was she saving herself for marriage?
00:06:26.761,00:06:29.097,"Well, maybe she didn't want to wait."
00:06:30.014,00:06:32.517,Girls like fooling around just as much as boys.
00:06:33.726,00:06:35.895,"That's okay, Benjamin."
00:06:35.978,00:06:37.146,"We understand, that's..."
00:06:38.064,00:06:39.440,That's private.
00:06:39.524,00:06:40.775,We'll keep it private.
00:06:45.863,00:06:48.074,"Beverly Jean was, uh, my..."
00:06:49.700,00:06:50.868,"first, uh..."
00:06:51.452,00:06:53.788,Your first sexual experience?
00:06:53.871,00:06:54.997,Yeah.
00:06:56.707,00:06:57.875,But she was nice.
00:06:59.919,00:07:06.384,"I don't know what all this has to do with what happened to her-- Listen, Benjamin. We're from a particular unit of the FBI."
00:07:06.467,00:07:09.303,We investigate murders when there's a sexual angle.
00:07:09.387,00:07:11.931,"It may be unpleasant, but it's what we do."
00:07:17.937,00:07:19.605,"It's awful, what was done to her."
00:07:20.982,00:07:22.275,Does he know?
00:07:23.901,00:07:25.361,"Mark, seriously?"
00:07:27.488,00:07:35.121,He only knows about the breasts. It was another officer-- -It's hard keeping this quiet. -I want to talk to Mrs. Barnwright.
00:07:35.204,00:07:37.540,"Should we stop at a pay phone, give her a heads up, too?"
00:07:39.667,00:07:41.294,-I didn't buy them. -Think he was faking?
00:07:43.713,00:07:46.632,-It sure got us out of there. -He's obviously a mama's boy.
00:07:49.469,00:07:50.636,What do you mean?
00:07:50.720,00:07:53.222,He was a virgin? He serves donuts?
00:07:53.723,00:07:57.643,"All of that could have been rehearsed, especially since he knew we were coming."
00:07:59.645,00:08:02.231,Benjamin has never seemed like a performer to me.
00:08:03.483,00:08:05.526,Two Feds in your living room would make anybody nervous.
00:08:05.610,00:08:08.279,"Look at him, you think he could have easily moved a body?"
00:08:08.362,00:08:10.198,Not without bursting into tears.
00:08:20.708,00:08:25.254,-He was so excited to have a girlfriend. -Did she reciprocate those feelings?
00:08:26.214,00:08:28.090,He said that she was crazy about him.
00:08:28.174,00:08:30.343,-Did you meet her? -Of course.
00:08:31.469,00:08:32.762,What were they like together?
00:08:32.845,00:08:35.181,"Well, they were... normal."
00:08:35.932,00:08:39.644,"She teased him a lot. He pretended not to enjoy it, but I know he did."
00:08:40.770,00:08:43.356,Benjamin told us the two of them argued sometimes.
00:08:44.941,00:08:46.359,Did you see him?
00:08:47.652,00:08:48.736,This morning.
00:08:50.863,00:08:52.281,Is he in trouble?
00:08:53.574,00:08:57.453,"We're just going over the case again, talking to everyone who knew Beverly Jean."
00:08:58.329,00:09:01.874,Well... I never heard them argue.
00:09:03.000,00:09:06.170,"Benjamin is soft, you know."
00:09:06.254,00:09:07.713,What was he like as a kid?
00:09:07.797,00:09:12.009,"He was always sensitive. But when his father ran off, he just..."
00:09:17.932,00:09:19.016,Well...
00:09:19.725,00:09:21.852,"he started to cry a lot, wet the bed."
00:09:24.647,00:09:27.316,I had to leave the kids on their own a lot.
00:09:27.733,00:09:31.070,"Rose helped out, but she was just so little."
00:09:33.990,00:09:36.659,Those were hard years. I did a lot of praying.
00:09:38.995,00:09:41.747,But then Rose met Frank and he moved in with us.
00:09:42.290,00:09:43.583,Frank Janderman.
00:09:45.334,00:09:47.378,"They just had a baby, you know."
00:09:47.461,00:09:48.838,Your first grandchild?
00:09:49.589,00:09:50.923,Congratulations.
00:09:52.258,00:09:56.762,"People talked about Frank back then, but I never listened to all that."
00:09:56.846,00:09:59.682,I loved him from the first time I met him. I still do.
00:09:59.765,00:10:01.475,Did Benjamin feel the same way?
00:10:02.977,00:10:04.979,"Well, he started to go out, you know."
00:10:05.062,00:10:06.939,He became friends with Frank.
00:10:07.565,00:10:08.941,Frank protected him.
00:10:10.026,00:10:12.028,He wouldn't let anyone near Rose.
00:10:13.738,00:10:16.949,He even got Benji a job so I didn't have to work two shifts.
00:10:18.159,00:10:21.579,Sometimes Rose said I loved him more than she did.
00:10:24.123,00:10:25.124,When was this?
00:10:27.126,00:10:32.048,"Well, uh... they got married at 18, so Rose must have been..."
00:10:34.508,00:10:36.010,"15, 16 at the time."
00:10:36.552,00:10:38.888,Frank moved in. Why?
00:10:40.681,00:10:42.058,"Well, I don't remember."
00:10:43.392,00:10:46.812,"He had some problems at home with his father, as young boys do."
00:10:48.064,00:10:50.441,But he got them their own place when they married.
00:10:50.524,00:10:53.319,And Benjamin lived at home with you until he met Beverly Jean?
00:10:56.364,00:10:58.074,It's been a strange time.
00:10:59.283,00:11:14.507,"We were so happy that Rose and Frank were having a baby, Like mother, like son."
00:11:15.007,00:11:16.926,You think there's a gene for crying?
00:11:17.510,00:11:20.596,I keep wondering why Beverly was with him in the first place.
00:11:20.679,00:11:24.433,"She might have liked that he was older, easy to talk to. He's sensitive."
00:11:24.850,00:11:26.685,"Half glazed, half cake?"
00:11:27.061,00:11:27.978,Sure.
00:11:29.146,00:11:33.192,I bet Beverly had poor old pipsqueak Benji wrapped around her golden triangle.
00:11:33.692,00:11:37.154,Maybe she wanted a nice guy with a steady income who loved her.
00:11:37.238,00:11:39.031,"Whatever you say, Ocasek."
00:11:39.865,00:11:40.783,What's that?
00:11:41.242,00:11:43.077,We were just saying there's not much here.
00:11:43.994,00:11:45.871,I assured Mrs. Barnwright this was a formality.
00:11:45.955,00:11:48.833,"-It's not a formality. -Well, I can tell her it is."
00:11:49.542,00:11:50.960,So where does this leave us?
00:11:52.503,00:11:53.337,There's still Alvin.
00:11:53.421,00:11:56.465,You don't want it to be someone in the community. Neither of you do.
00:11:56.549,00:11:59.802,Who drives all this way to come to some rust belt town?
00:11:59.885,00:12:02.388,"If you're hunting for girls, you got big cities."
00:12:02.471,00:12:04.598,You got freeways with hitchhikers.
00:12:04.682,00:12:06.058,Why choose a place like this?
00:12:17.403,00:12:18.988,-Hi. -There you are.
00:12:19.071,00:12:21.740,I got all kinds of fun things for you to look over.
00:12:21.824,00:12:22.741,Ooh. Paperwork?
00:12:22.825,00:12:27.455,"Yeah, it's hardly sexy, but I'm trying to put together a list of questions for the killers that you interview."
00:12:27.538,00:12:32.418,"Things like family history, mood, thought patterns before, during, and after the crime."
00:12:32.501,00:12:36.255,"This is just a first draft, but look it over and let me know what you think."
00:12:36.338,00:12:38.924,Shouldn't we tailor the interviews based on the killer's personality?
00:12:39.008,00:12:40.092,You mean just wing it?
00:12:40.176,00:12:42.720,"With these guys, we need to look for different ways in."
00:12:42.803,00:12:46.515,"Yes, but we still need a data set that's consistent across all our subjects."
00:12:48.017,00:12:48.851,You leaving?
00:12:48.934,00:12:50.478,-Back to Boston. -You just got here.
00:12:51.020,00:12:54.106,"Well, until you conduct more interviews, there's really nothing for me to do here."
00:12:54.190,00:12:57.526,We had a really interesting conversation with the fiancé of that victim in Altoona.
00:12:59.528,00:13:01.947,-I got a taxi waiting. -Cancel it. I'll drive you.
00:13:08.537,00:13:10.456,-Let me take your bag. -Thank you.
00:13:11.790,00:13:14.793,He lost it. I've never seen a guy cry like that.
00:13:15.711,00:13:17.129,Bill was skeptical.
00:13:17.213,00:13:18.881,-But you believed him? -It looked real.
00:13:19.715,00:13:22.009,"Well, how did it feel? I mean, were you moved?"
00:13:22.092,00:13:24.345,-Did you want to comfort him? -I wanted him to stop.
00:13:24.428,00:13:26.013,Why'd you want him to stop?
00:13:26.096,00:13:27.890,"I don't know, maybe I'm just callous."
00:13:29.058,00:13:30.601,"Try a little harder, Holden."
00:13:34.647,00:13:35.731,It felt wrong.
00:13:36.565,00:13:40.819,"Benjamin was blubbering like a baby, but it didn't seem vulnerable."
00:13:41.612,00:13:43.030,It felt hostile.
00:13:43.656,00:13:48.035,"You know, psychopaths are extremely skilled at imitating human emotions."
00:13:48.118,00:13:52.289,It's how they manipulate other people or how they gain power over their environment.
00:13:52.373,00:13:54.708,How do they understand emotions if they don't have them?
00:13:54.792,00:13:57.670,"Well, they have emotions. They just don't believe other people have them."
00:13:57.753,00:14:01.465,"Or more specifically, they don't believe that other people have interior lives."
00:14:01.549,00:14:02.925,How do we sniff them out?
00:14:03.008,00:14:05.427,"Well, it seems like you just did. Trust your instincts."
00:14:05.511,00:14:10.182,The whole town sees Benjamin as this lost little puppy that needs protecting.
00:14:10.849,00:14:12.226,Maybe my instincts are wrong.
00:14:12.309,00:14:16.397,"Well, we're developing a methodology, so use it."
00:14:18.691,00:14:20.693,Look at where the perpetrator went.
00:14:21.110,00:14:24.071,"Hair, breasts, vagina, all symbols of her sexual power."
00:14:24.154,00:14:27.449,Disfiguring her reproductive organs was a way to neutralize her.
00:14:27.533,00:14:30.494,What about the hair on the ironing board? Was that some kind of display?
00:14:30.578,00:14:32.746,Like a trophy. A way to assert his dominance.
00:14:32.830,00:14:36.417,Benjamin is anything but assertive. Beverly's the first woman he slept with.
00:14:36.500,00:14:38.002,-How old is he? -Twenty-six.
00:14:38.085,00:14:40.713,So that would give the relationship an extra significance.
00:14:40.796,00:14:45.217,Bill thinks the only reason she was with him is because she has total sexual control over him.
00:14:45.301,00:14:47.678,"Well, what's her history? Was she a virgin, too?"
00:14:47.761,00:14:48.929,He was touchy about that.
00:14:49.013,00:14:53.183,"So then she had some experience, which could either excite or threaten him."
00:14:53.267,00:14:55.811,"In the photo, she looks like the girl next door."
00:14:55.895,00:14:59.315,"You really believe that a young, pretty girl can't be manipulative?"
00:15:02.276,00:15:07.823,"and you have absolutely no evidence for this, then it would be what many women do to have an ounce of power in this world."
00:15:07.907,00:15:14.663,"Fine, but if it went too far, if something happened and Benjamin snapped, could feelings of impotence explain his rage?"
00:15:14.747,00:15:20.669,"Could it explain him going back four days later to cut her up like you said, -as an attempt to assert control? -Possibly."
00:15:20.753,00:15:23.172,But then wouldn't the rape already have accomplished that?
00:15:23.255,00:15:25.174,-Accomplish control? -Exactly.
00:15:25.591,00:15:30.512,"In all the crimes we've studied, there's never been an example of a victim being raped then depersonalized."
00:15:30.596,00:15:34.850,"If the killer mutilates her after death, then he usually commits sexual acts after death as well."
00:15:34.934,00:15:37.645,To make up for his sense of inadequacy while she was still alive.
00:15:37.728,00:15:40.522,It's like there's two different presentations in this crime scene.
00:15:44.151,00:15:45.986,Anybody picking you up in Boston?
00:15:46.528,00:15:48.614,I'll grab a cab. Bye.
00:15:57.706,00:15:59.959,-Hey. -Hey. What are you...
00:16:03.629,00:16:05.214,-Up to? -Studying.
00:16:05.756,00:16:07.049,Pulling an all-nighter.
00:16:11.845,00:16:13.097,Due tomorrow.
00:16:14.682,00:16:16.266,It's about the people who really run this country.
00:16:16.642,00:16:19.144,Hardly what our democracy is supposed to be about.
00:16:20.062,00:16:22.147,-Are you okay? -What?
00:16:22.231,00:16:23.857,-You seem-- -Oh. My friend gave me diet pills.
00:16:24.400,00:16:26.568,-Really? -Speed actually makes this interesting.
00:16:29.571,00:16:30.656,May I see those?
00:16:32.950,00:16:35.494,"Great for concentration, keeps you totally focused."
00:16:35.577,00:16:38.747,-Beer? Coffee? Tea? -Is this legal?
00:16:38.831,00:16:41.083,Uh-oh. Out comes the narc.
00:16:44.878,00:16:49.633,We were digging into his relationship with the fiancé and he burst into tears.
00:16:50.175,00:16:55.139,"Bill thought he was bullshitting, but psychopaths are extremely skilled at imitating human emotions."
00:16:55.222,00:16:56.890,I once went crying to my professor.
00:16:58.684,00:16:59.768,You fake cried?
00:16:59.852,00:17:02.938,Made up an elaborate story about my dad in some horrendous accident.
00:17:03.022,00:17:04.898,-When was this? -My freshman year.
00:17:04.982,00:17:07.776,"I was partying a little too much, almost flunked out of school."
00:17:12.740,00:17:14.950,Made for a good show. He raised my grade to a C.
00:17:15.034,00:17:16.201,-Your teacher was male. -So?
00:17:20.039,00:17:22.708,-Not my point. -Why were you drinking so much?
00:17:24.251,00:17:28.213,I wanted to fit in. I wanted to be wild and crazy.
00:17:28.297,00:17:30.591,-Why? -I was tired of always thinking.
00:17:31.216,00:17:33.677,-Don't you get tired of thinking? -No.
00:17:34.887,00:17:37.056,And it made it easier to sleep with people.
00:17:45.481,00:17:48.192,-A lot? -What difference does that make?
00:17:48.275,00:17:50.736,-Just curious. -And judgmental.
00:17:52.488,00:17:53.489,Five...
00:17:54.948,00:17:56.909,-Ten... -This is getting tedious.
00:18:00.037,00:18:03.290,-Ten? -Holden... I'm not doing this.
00:18:15.844,00:18:17.471,"-Hell, pick him up. -What do I tell him?"
00:18:17.554,00:18:21.266,Don't tell him anything. Let him stew for a few hours until we get there.
00:18:21.350,00:18:22.184,Okay.
00:18:23.936,00:18:25.604,Ocasek looked into Frank Janderman.
00:18:26.146,00:18:31.026,"Apparently, in high school, he was sent to a psychiatric hospital for taking a monkey wrench to a girl."
00:18:32.111,00:18:34.238,-Frank Janderman? -Rose's husband.
00:18:37.574,00:18:38.951,We should get this on tape.
00:18:42.871,00:18:47.459,"So I got to thinking, why did Mrs. Barnwright say people were talking about Frank back then?"
00:18:47.876,00:18:49.795,"-What were they talking about, right? -Right."
00:18:49.878,00:18:52.464,So I talked to this family court judge who's a friend of mine.
00:18:52.548,00:18:54.341,"Sure enough, he remembers the case."
00:18:54.424,00:18:57.261,"Since Frank was a juvenile when the assault occurred, the court sealed the records."
00:18:58.011,00:19:00.472,"Fortunately, the judge is a very good friend of mine."
00:19:01.223,00:19:05.686,"Here's what we've got on Frank's hearing, and his time at Warren State."
00:19:05.769,00:19:07.062,"Nice work, Mark."
00:19:07.437,00:19:10.274,This is where your community system pays off.
00:19:10.357,00:19:13.402,He's been here since nine. Maybe we should-- Let him wait.
00:19:15.195,00:19:16.738,Why don't we have a cup of coffee?
00:19:17.739,00:19:19.992,"If Frank's a hothead, it'll irritate him, throw him off."
00:19:22.494,00:19:23.996,Class of '71?
00:19:24.079,00:19:26.415,-Yep. -You go to your five-year reunion?
00:19:27.416,00:19:29.543,I don't really keep up with that stuff.
00:19:30.043,00:19:33.088,"It's commendable that you graduated, seeing as how you missed your junior year."
00:19:33.172,00:19:35.549,What do you want from me? I've been here all day.
00:19:35.632,00:19:38.677,-I answered all your questions last week. -We just have a few more.
00:19:40.596,00:19:42.014,You've got everyone in a tizzy.
00:19:42.806,00:19:44.224,-You mean Benjamin? -Yeah.
00:19:44.308,00:19:48.896,"The whole family. Me, my wife, mom. You scared the shit out of Benji."
00:19:51.690,00:19:53.609,And for keeping you for so long.
00:19:53.692,00:19:55.903,Beverly Jean Shaw was close with your family.
00:19:57.696,00:19:58.697,She wasn't that close.
00:19:59.948,00:20:01.491,She was about to marry your brother-in-law.
00:20:01.575,00:20:02.701,They hadn't set a date.
00:20:03.869,00:20:06.997,-I didn't spend a lot of time with him. -You and Benjamin aren't close?
00:20:07.080,00:20:08.999,What's this close shit? That's like women.
00:20:10.500,00:20:12.461,Mrs. Barnwright said you looked out for him.
00:20:13.545,00:20:16.465,"-Well, yeah, he's a shrimp. -And he's your brother-in-law."
00:20:17.049,00:20:18.175,Yep.
00:20:18.258,00:20:21.053,-So you would help him if he needed it. -Yep.
00:20:24.097,00:20:25.933,Did you fight a lot in high school?
00:20:26.516,00:20:27.351,Like Popeye.
00:20:30.229,00:20:33.315,How'd you land yourself in Warren State Psychiatric Hospital?
00:20:36.485,00:20:38.111,It's probably in your fucking file.
00:20:38.654,00:20:40.072,We want to hear your side.
00:20:43.992,00:20:46.495,"This girl freaked out on me, came after me with a wrench."
00:20:46.578,00:20:49.206,"I tried to get it, it swang back, hit her in the face."
00:20:49.289,00:20:51.416,Then all this shit came raining down on me.
00:20:52.334,00:20:53.794,Why'd she freak out?
00:20:53.877,00:20:57.130,"-I was seeing some other girl, too. -You a ladies man?"
00:20:57.214,00:20:58.924,Maybe. Back then.
00:20:59.800,00:21:02.511,-They sent you to a mental institution. -That was bullshit.
00:21:02.594,00:21:05.222,"-I had to go, it was part of the plea. -You did a plea deal?"
00:21:05.305,00:21:07.307,"Why not go to court, tell them what you told us?"
00:21:07.391,00:21:10.686,My lawyer said I'd never win against a sweet girl with a broken nose.
00:21:12.312,00:21:15.148,"There were other infractions, I was running around like a jackass back then."
00:21:15.232,00:21:18.610,-But no longer? -I'm married now. Got a kid.
00:21:19.152,00:21:21.863,Marriage and fatherhood don't make anger go away.
00:21:21.947,00:21:24.283,"I wasn't angry, I was just..."
00:21:24.366,00:21:25.951,Misunderstood?
00:21:26.785,00:21:29.454,"Makes me sound like a pussy, but yeah."
00:21:30.706,00:21:33.250,Want to tell us about the night Beverly Jean disappeared?
00:21:35.377,00:21:39.464,"I don't know. It was, uh... typical, I guess."
00:21:39.548,00:21:41.425,Rose was still pregnant back then.
00:21:41.925,00:21:44.011,Got her some dinner and watched TV.
00:21:44.094,00:21:46.221,-So you were home all night. -No.
00:21:46.305,00:21:47.597,No?
00:21:48.265,00:21:51.059,"No. I told you, I went out and got us dinner."
00:21:51.560,00:21:52.728,How long were you gone?
00:21:53.061,00:21:55.772,"I don't know, 15, 20 minutes maybe."
00:21:57.649,00:21:59.943,Rose likes the rolls at Hannah's Diner on Market Street.
00:22:00.027,00:22:01.570,And Rose will confirm this?
00:22:02.904,00:22:05.574,Am I under some kind of suspicion here?
00:22:05.657,00:22:08.994,We're just looking at it from every angle.
00:22:10.746,00:22:13.290,"No, Beverly Jean was, uh... was Benji's girl."
00:22:13.373,00:22:14.750,I barely knew her.
00:22:14.833,00:22:17.836,"Strange, seeing as how she was about to be part of the family."
00:22:19.212,00:22:21.048,Stop saying it like that.
00:22:21.465,00:22:23.425,You said they hadn't set a date for the wedding.
00:22:24.384,00:22:27.387,"-It was loose. -They were engaged, weren't they?"
00:22:28.847,00:22:30.307,Benji thought they were.
00:22:32.726,00:22:37.189,"The impression I got is that she was in love with him, wanted to marry him."
00:22:37.606,00:22:42.569,"Oh, man, I don't want to rain on his parade-- You're saying he made the relationship more than what it was?"
00:22:42.652,00:22:44.738,She let him call her his girlfriend.
00:22:44.821,00:22:46.198,He got that apartment for her.
00:22:46.281,00:22:48.617,"Yeah, that was the big plan, get her to move in."
00:22:48.700,00:22:51.745,-Was Beverly even sleeping with him? -Now and again.
00:22:52.370,00:22:54.581,"A looker like her, he thought he'd died and gone to heaven."
00:22:54.664,00:22:57.793,-You found her attractive? -She's a seven.
00:22:57.876,00:23:00.337,"Really? From the photos, I'd give her an eight."
00:23:00.420,00:23:01.755,"In Altoona, she's a solid eight."
00:23:03.090,00:23:05.801,I thought Benji had done pretty good for himself.
00:23:06.718,00:23:08.303,Especially for a guy who's...
00:23:09.513,00:23:10.806,so quick to cry.
00:23:11.515,00:23:12.390,"Shit, yeah."
00:23:12.474,00:23:15.519,Do you think that he was satisfying her?
00:23:19.773,00:23:22.651,-I don't think he was blowing her mind. -She tell you that?
00:23:22.734,00:23:25.821,"Not in so many words, but when a chick's enjoying it, she's all over you."
00:23:25.904,00:23:27.614,You think Beverly Jean knew the difference?
00:23:28.448,00:23:31.618,"You think she'd, you know... been around?"
00:23:32.994,00:23:36.331,"I'd say she was, uh... open."
00:23:41.503,00:23:44.172,I don't know if he didn't get it or he didn't want to.
00:23:53.640,00:23:56.726,Everyone we interviewed said Beverly Jean was...
00:23:56.810,00:24:00.313,"nice, loyal, decent."
00:24:00.397,00:24:01.356,Well...
00:24:03.441,00:24:06.236,no one's gonna come right out and say the dead girl was easy.
00:24:06.319,00:24:09.364,Frank's cagey. You hear him deflect on that deal in high school?
00:24:10.198,00:24:12.075,He could have made that up about her being a slut.
00:24:12.159,00:24:12.993,What if he didn't?
00:24:13.535,00:24:25.881,"Listen, if Beverly had the upper hand in the relationship and made Benjamin feel jealous by seeing other men, if Benjamin felt sexually powerless, he might lash out with the kind of anger we see in this crime."
00:24:26.506,00:24:28.592,Let's see what Benjamin has to say.
00:24:28.675,00:24:30.385,-Bring him in? -Yeah.
00:24:30.760,00:24:32.679,You understand you're not under arrest?
00:24:32.762,00:24:35.932,"You're free to leave at any point, only have to talk to us if you want to."
00:24:36.016,00:24:38.560,And you're okay with us recording this conversation?
00:24:38.643,00:24:40.604,It's just so much easier than writing everything down.
00:24:40.687,00:24:42.731,Yeah. I want to help if I can.
00:24:43.857,00:24:47.068,"You know a lot about this case you're not telling us, don't you?"
00:24:47.485,00:24:50.655,"Uh, no, nothing more than what I already said."
00:24:50.739,00:24:51.656,We talked to Frank.
00:24:52.199,00:24:54.618,He paints a different picture of your relationship with Beverly.
00:24:54.701,00:24:57.621,He said you made up that part about you and her being engaged.
00:24:58.496,00:24:59.873,Uh...
00:24:59.956,00:25:05.545,"Well, I didn't have a ring yet, but, um, but I asked her and she said yes."
00:25:05.629,00:25:07.964,It sounded like she wanted to keep her options open.
00:25:15.222,00:25:16.723,Did Frank say that?
00:25:22.520,00:25:24.064,Why would he be jealous?
00:25:24.147,00:25:26.066,He's married. To your sister.
00:25:26.149,00:25:27.025,Well...
00:25:28.860,00:25:35.200,"He was always asking when... she was coming around, always talking to her like she was his girlfriend."
00:25:35.283,00:25:41.706,"-What do you mean? -Like Hey, hon, Hey, babe, Hey, sweetheart, go get me a beer."
00:25:42.540,00:25:43.375,And...
00:25:45.210,00:25:47.295,he was always getting her to sit on his lap.
00:25:47.963,00:25:51.549,-Did she want to sit on his lap? -She had to or it would've been rude.
00:25:51.633,00:25:55.136,"-Did he try to have sex with her? -No, it didn't go that far."
00:26:00.225,00:26:03.270,"-Do what, have sex? She had sex with you. -She loved me."
00:26:03.353,00:26:05.939,But she wasn't exactly saving herself for marriage.
00:26:08.608,00:26:10.443,"Do you think you satisfied her, Benjamin?"
00:26:24.708,00:26:26.626,Did you see her that night when she got off work?
00:26:26.710,00:26:29.087,"No. I was home, I was watching television."
00:26:29.170,00:26:31.464,"Didn't you want her to come over, hang out with you?"
00:26:31.548,00:26:34.926,"Of course I wanted her to come over, because I loved her."
00:26:38.346,00:26:41.016,"Oh, my God!"
00:26:41.599,00:26:43.476,"Oh, my God!"
00:26:53.737,00:26:55.447,So did Beverly Jean sleep around?
00:26:58.074,00:27:00.994,-Alvin tried to pick her up at a bar. -She turned him down.
00:27:02.954,00:27:05.915,"-Having a drink? -Was she alone, with a girlfriend?"
00:27:05.999,00:27:07.334,What would that tell us?
00:27:07.417,00:27:09.169,A single woman in a bar...
00:27:09.252,00:27:11.463,A single woman might go alone just to have a drink.
00:27:11.546,00:27:14.132,What about her? Is she trying to pick someone up?
00:27:14.799,00:27:17.344,"-Well, probably. -Why, because she's by herself?"
00:27:17.802,00:27:19.054,Because she's at a bar?
00:27:20.555,00:27:21.598,-Yeah. -That's an assumption.
00:27:21.681,00:27:24.851,"Say she is looking for someone, does that make her easy?"
00:27:24.934,00:27:26.811,Is she looking for a husband or a one-night stand?
00:27:26.895,00:27:28.688,Does the difference change your perception?
00:27:28.772,00:27:30.106,-Sure. -Why?
00:27:30.190,00:27:34.778,"Well, changes whether I'd be interested in her, theoretically."
00:27:34.861,00:27:37.906,What if you're looking for a one-night stand... theoretically?
00:27:37.989,00:27:40.408,"No, I don't-- It's not my thing."
00:27:42.077,00:27:47.874,"Beverly's sexual history is only important because if she was seeing other men, then obviously they're suspects."
00:27:47.957,00:27:49.459,So who else can we talk to?
00:27:52.545,00:27:56.257,There's a couple of friends we could question... again.
00:27:56.341,00:27:58.176,Anyone else she might have confided in?
00:27:58.885,00:28:01.679,She did just get her hair done. Right?
00:28:03.973,00:28:09.771,"Here's a question, if it is Benjamin or some other boyfriend who freaked out on her, does the case merit our involvement?"
00:28:11.147,00:28:17.654,"We still can't rule out a sequence killer, but if the perpetrator was a townie, then the crime is random, and there's no expectation that he'll be repeating it."
00:28:17.737,00:28:21.032,"Here's my question, shouldn't our funding cover separate rooms?"
00:28:21.116,00:28:22.534,You don't like my company?
00:28:23.159,00:28:24.536,We'll get connecting doors.
00:28:48.309,00:28:51.020,"Would you mind sitting on your own bed, please?"
00:29:18.173,00:29:19.591,"Well, that was a dead end."
00:29:20.049,00:29:21.217,Who's next?
00:29:21.301,00:29:23.803,"One of the families she baby-sat for, the Snyders."
00:29:25.263,00:29:28.433,You mind if we take a quick detour? Something's been bugging me.
00:29:52.665,00:29:53.625,"Hi, Rose."
00:29:58.046,00:29:59.339,I just got him to sleep.
00:29:59.422,00:30:01.174,Pretty hard having a newborn.
00:30:01.257,00:30:03.218,All anybody ever tells you is how great it is.
00:30:03.301,00:30:08.640,"But my wife and I, with both our kids, we walked around like zombies for the first three months."
00:30:10.308,00:30:14.437,"You know, Trinity Lutheran, over on Sycamore, has a program for single moms."
00:30:14.521,00:30:20.068,"Not that you're single, but it's your first child and they'll have all kinds of information on feeding him, getting him to sleep."
00:30:25.031,00:30:25.949,He's got work.
00:30:26.032,00:30:28.618,Your mom certainly seems excited about having a grandbaby.
00:30:30.453,00:30:32.372,"And Benjamin, is he helping?"
00:30:36.793,00:30:38.044,He's my older brother.
00:30:41.089,00:30:42.215,Fourteen months.
00:30:42.298,00:30:44.008,You have good memories growing up?
00:30:44.551,00:30:46.886,Mom went to work. Got two jobs.
00:30:47.303,00:30:49.597,"Two kids, two jobs. How'd she swing that?"
00:30:51.558,00:30:53.309,We would walk home in the afternoon.
00:30:53.393,00:30:56.437,-And you were how old? -Ten. Maybe eleven.
00:30:56.521,00:30:57.564,That's pretty young.
00:30:58.064,00:31:01.484,"Mom would come home tired, wasn't really up for dealing with kids."
00:31:02.360,00:31:05.446,-I'd make sure the house was clean. -It's no small feat.
00:31:08.032,00:31:10.910,-How old were you when you met Frank? -Sixteen.
00:31:11.452,00:31:13.997,You know about the incident with Frank in high school?
00:31:16.875,00:31:18.376,It was before I met him.
00:31:24.924,00:31:25.925,Rose...
00:31:27.093,00:31:28.469,you knew Beverly Jean.
00:31:30.179,00:31:31.389,What was she like?
00:31:31.848,00:31:33.349,She was really sweet.
00:31:36.185,00:31:37.896,She made him want to leave home.
00:31:38.938,00:31:40.189,I thought that was good.
00:31:41.900,00:31:45.278,We gave him money for a security deposit. Signed his lease.
00:31:45.361,00:31:46.905,Did she intend to marry him?
00:31:49.032,00:31:50.283,He was working on her.
00:31:50.742,00:31:53.536,Was she... seeing other men?
00:31:56.706,00:31:59.042,Benjamin thought she might be.
00:31:59.125,00:32:00.293,Benjamin told you this?
00:32:03.129,00:32:06.174,He said he thought she was giving him the runaround.
00:32:07.258,00:32:09.218,Getting done up for other guys.
00:32:10.011,00:32:11.054,Done up how?
00:32:11.137,00:32:12.764,Dressing provocatively?
00:32:15.683,00:32:16.726,Getting her hair done.
00:32:21.814,00:32:23.232,-Is that true? -Yes.
00:32:25.360,00:32:26.402,"Well, uh..."
00:32:28.738,00:32:30.823,he went out to get us food.
00:32:54.931,00:33:00.812,"Rose, if you are hiding something and they find out about it, it will not be good for you..."
00:33:01.980,00:33:03.022,or for him.
00:33:24.544,00:33:25.753,What are we missing?
00:33:32.218,00:33:33.302,You think Frank did that?
00:33:33.386,00:33:36.639,Her mother told us that he wouldn't let anyone else get close to her.
00:33:38.516,00:33:39.600,Should we search Frank's car?
00:33:45.064,00:33:48.109,Mark. There's a young woman downstairs asking for you.
00:33:59.620,00:34:00.621,"Hi, Rose."
00:34:15.136,00:34:16.054,Of course.
00:34:20.975,00:34:21.934,It's okay.
00:34:33.946,00:34:37.909,So you said Frank was not home the night Beverly Jean disappeared?
00:34:40.453,00:34:41.370,Yes.
00:34:42.080,00:34:43.414,Do you know where he was?
00:34:45.750,00:34:46.709,Yes.
00:34:48.419,00:34:49.462,Where was he?
00:34:50.588,00:34:53.382,Benji called us that night and asked Frank to come over.
00:34:56.344,00:34:57.428,Okay.
00:34:58.930,00:35:00.264,So Frank left.
00:35:00.848,00:35:02.183,How long was he gone?
00:35:06.646,00:35:09.899,He called after two or three hours. Asked me to come over there too.
00:35:09.982,00:35:12.902,-What time was this? -Ten or eleven?
00:35:12.985,00:35:14.946,But I told him I was tired.
00:35:15.696,00:35:17.365,My back hurt. My feet.
00:35:19.992,00:35:21.994,I was more than eight months pregnant.
00:35:22.370,00:35:24.705,Did he say why he wanted you to come over?
00:35:24.789,00:35:25.790,No.
00:35:27.291,00:35:28.835,He just said to come?
00:35:29.418,00:35:31.212,He said to bring cleaning supplies.
00:35:34.841,00:35:36.926,But... I forgot.
00:35:40.721,00:35:42.807,"Drove over, let myself in."
00:35:43.432,00:35:47.436,Frank was in the living room. He told me not to get upset.
00:35:47.520,00:35:48.688,Was he upset?
00:35:49.689,00:35:50.731,He was calm.
00:35:51.357,00:35:54.193,Okay. So Frank tells you not to get upset...
00:35:56.195,00:35:58.990,He told me something bad had happened.
00:36:00.867,00:36:04.912,"My mind started racing, I was worried something had happened to Benji."
00:36:07.915,00:36:10.376,"Frank said, He's fine, but he's done something."
00:36:13.171,00:36:14.589,Benjamin did something?
00:36:17.800,00:36:18.759,Yes.
00:36:21.012,00:36:22.555,"I said, What's he done?"
00:36:24.307,00:36:27.393,He said he got mad at Beverly Jean.
00:36:41.657,00:36:43.451,I asked if she was okay.
00:36:48.331,00:36:50.958,"Frank said, We got to help Benjamin out of this."
00:36:51.042,00:36:53.878,We got to stick together or he's going to get in trouble.
00:36:57.965,00:36:59.634,I asked where Benjamin was.
00:37:00.718,00:37:02.303,"He said, He's in the bathroom."
00:37:03.888,00:37:06.557,"I said, I want to see him. He said, Okay."
00:37:08.142,00:37:10.144,But Beverly Jean is in there too.
00:37:13.064,00:37:14.357,The door was open.
00:37:15.066,00:37:17.276,I saw Benji. He...
00:37:17.360,00:37:20.071,"He had his head in his hands, he was crying."
00:37:20.988,00:37:23.574,There was blood everywhere.
00:37:24.075,00:37:25.243,Splashing.
00:37:27.161,00:37:29.580,And then I see Beverly Jean in the bathtub.
00:37:31.457,00:37:32.750,Was she alive?
00:37:35.169,00:37:36.003,Dead.
00:37:38.005,00:37:40.675,"She had her top on, but no panties."
00:37:43.010,00:37:45.888,"I said, Benji, what have you done?"
00:37:47.807,00:37:49.976,He shook his head. He didn't want to look at me.
00:37:50.601,00:37:53.271,"-Was she face up, face down? -Face up."
00:37:53.354,00:37:54.730,Did you notice any wounds?
00:37:55.523,00:37:57.775,"I couldn't tell, there was a lot of blood."
00:37:58.359,00:37:59.527,Then what happened?
00:37:59.986,00:38:03.114,"Then Frank brought in a tarp, spread it on the floor."
00:38:03.614,00:38:06.325,Then he asked me to go get cleaning supplies.
00:38:07.076,00:38:08.953,"When I came back, they had already rolled her up."
00:38:14.125,00:38:16.460,I washed out the tub and cleaned up the bathroom.
00:38:17.128,00:38:22.300,"I scrubbed the tiles, in the cracks, the grouting, the window frame."
00:38:23.175,00:38:26.512,I had to wash all the blood down the sink and that seemed to...
00:38:27.263,00:38:28.514,It took forever...
00:38:29.473,00:38:31.350,trying to get it all to go down.
00:38:36.188,00:38:37.481,What'd you do with it?
00:38:40.067,00:38:43.154,"Took it to the kitchen, washed it with dish soap."
00:38:43.612,00:38:44.822,Put it away.
00:38:48.576,00:38:49.994,And then I went home.
00:38:53.998,00:38:55.875,Frank came home early the next morning.
00:38:58.961,00:39:00.046,Why did you help them?
00:39:02.965,00:39:04.925,It's just what I've always done.
00:39:07.345,00:39:08.429,Who killed her?
00:39:10.848,00:39:12.058,I don't know.
00:00:16.307,00:00:17.183,Okay.
00:02:23.935,00:02:26.229,"-Thanks for coming up, Dr. Carr. -Of course."
00:02:26.312,00:02:31.985,"I realized I don't know much about your life in Boston, outside of your work at the university. Do you have a husband?"
00:02:32.652,00:02:34.612,"-No. -Kids, or...?"
00:02:34.988,00:02:35.989,No. Neither.
00:02:36.072,00:02:38.783,"I've been following your work, and I have to say I'm rather impressed."
00:02:38.867,00:02:40.368,"Well, thank you. I appreciate that."
00:02:40.451,00:02:44.164,I'm not the only one. There's a growing interest in your project around here.
00:02:44.247,00:02:54.507,"So I was wondering, Agents Tench and Ford can't run this all by themselves, if you would be interested in managing the project and keeping things on track in a more permanent position here at Quantico."
00:02:54.591,00:02:58.011,-No. I can't. -You don't have to answer now.
00:02:58.094,00:03:01.598,"It's very flattering, but I already have a job in Boston."
00:03:01.681,00:03:07.937,"Dr. Carr, your knowledge and professionalism have already had a great impact on our understanding of behavioral science."
00:03:08.646,00:03:11.774,It would be a shame not to take full advantage of that.
00:03:11.858,00:03:13.484,Take your time.
00:03:16.571,00:03:17.614,Sleep on it.
00:03:23.202,00:03:26.998,I'd rather you didn't tell Tench or Ford about this until you make your decision.
00:03:27.081,00:03:28.583,-They don't know? -No.
00:03:32.045,00:03:35.548,"I have two questions for you, Benjamin. First one..."
00:03:36.591,00:03:38.468,-That thing on? -Yes.
00:03:38.551,00:03:41.512,What the fuck were you crying about last time we saw you?
00:03:41.596,00:03:45.600,"And secondly, and this one is a big question, so I want you to listen very carefully."
00:03:45.683,00:03:47.393,Are you listening to me? Benji?
00:03:48.686,00:03:51.940,Why? Why would you do that to Beverly Jean?
00:03:54.108,00:03:56.361,Fractured jaw. Two black eyes.
00:03:56.861,00:03:57.737,Why?
00:03:58.321,00:04:01.616,Fourteen stab wounds in the torso with a kitchen knife.
00:04:02.200,00:04:04.160,"Blow to the head, blunt force trauma."
00:04:04.244,00:04:06.371,Her breasts were amputated.
00:04:07.413,00:04:08.665,I need to know this.
00:04:09.958,00:04:12.043,"Why would you do that to your girlfriend, man?"
00:04:12.126,00:04:13.002,I didn't.
00:04:21.469,00:04:24.973,He called us. He was freaked out. I went over.
00:04:26.349,00:04:30.937,"-And then? -I walked into the living room and Beverly Jean was knocked out on the floor, tied up."
00:04:31.020,00:04:32.480,Did he tell you what happened?
00:04:34.482,00:04:38.152,"Think he tried to get into her panties, she wouldn't let him, he knocked her out."
00:04:38.236,00:04:40.655,-That's why he called you? -He calls me when he's in trouble.
00:04:43.408,00:04:45.743,-So why'd you kill her? -Don't answer that.
00:04:51.666,00:04:52.500,I didn't.
00:04:53.918,00:04:57.755,"Why would a man, any man, do that to a woman's breasts?"
00:04:57.839,00:05:01.968,And who would take a hunting knife to a woman's reproductive organs?
00:05:02.051,00:05:03.177,All right.
00:05:03.261,00:05:05.138,All right? There's nothing right about it.
00:05:05.221,00:05:07.390,That's enough. Now my client's also a victim here.
00:05:07.473,00:05:10.101,"A victim? Interesting, thank you, I'll take that."
00:05:10.184,00:05:12.353,Let's do an easy one. Why did you do that to her hair?
00:05:15.356,00:05:20.528,Frank seems to think Beverly Jean got to a point where she was interested in seeing other guys.
00:05:25.199,00:05:27.827,How does stabbing somebody in the asshole make you feel better?
00:05:27.910,00:05:29.078,Enough. This is speculation.
00:05:29.162,00:05:31.205,You still have the death penalty in Pennsylvania?
00:05:31.289,00:05:32.665,Don't threaten my client.
00:05:35.668,00:05:36.961,She fucked Frank.
00:05:41.966,00:05:46.054,I saw her on the living room floor with Frank on top of her.
00:05:46.137,00:05:47.180,So what did you do?
00:05:51.893,00:05:53.895,-No. -You hit her.
00:05:57.356,00:05:59.859,He's always saying he liked her hair.
00:06:01.694,00:06:03.154,Every time he saw her.
00:06:04.822,00:06:09.243,"Thing is, he didn't care about her hair at all. He just used it to rile me."
00:06:10.536,00:06:12.246,She was too stupid to notice.
00:06:16.542,00:06:18.753,She was already dead when I stabbed her.
00:06:21.005,00:06:22.256,She was already dead.
00:06:27.970,00:06:30.973,-Maybe show him how to do it? -Maybe to mess with him?
00:06:31.641,00:06:32.809,Fuck you.
00:06:34.018,00:06:36.270,I hope they fry your ass in the fucking chair.
00:06:36.354,00:06:37.855,Don't try to intimidate my client.
00:06:43.861,00:06:46.155,"If Benjamin killed her, you should just tell us."
00:06:48.032,00:06:49.575,I didn't see Benji kill her.
00:07:01.337,00:07:04.382,"I hate that fuck Frank, but it's always the boyfriend."
00:07:04.465,00:07:06.926,"When you're lost, you play the odds. It's Benjamin."
00:07:07.009,00:07:08.094,I'm not so sure.
00:07:08.594,00:07:11.347,You should have seen Frank after you walked out of the room.
00:07:11.431,00:07:14.142,"He looked at me and said, I did not see Benjamin kill her."
00:07:14.225,00:07:16.060,-They're messing with us. -I believed him.
00:07:16.144,00:07:19.313,-I am sick and tired of this shithole. -I know.
00:07:21.065,00:07:24.152,Hey. Nancy made me promise to invite you to dinner.
00:07:24.735,00:07:28.656,She wants to see who I'm spending all this time with. Have a look at you.
00:07:30.908,00:07:31.993,I would love that.
00:07:34.036,00:07:36.581,-Could I bring Debbie? -Of course.
00:07:43.963,00:07:47.216,He had his head in his hands. He was crying.
00:07:48.468,00:07:50.678,There was blood everywhere.
00:07:51.262,00:07:52.346,Splashing.
00:07:54.432,00:07:56.684,And then I see Beverly Jean in the bathtub.
00:08:07.403,00:08:10.281,He had his head in his hands. He was crying.
00:08:11.949,00:08:13.910,There was blood everywhere.
00:08:14.660,00:08:15.786,Splashing.
00:08:17.872,00:08:19.749,And then I see Beverly Jean in the bathtub.
00:08:24.253,00:08:25.129,She was there.
00:08:27.965,00:08:29.175,What makes you say that?
00:08:31.177,00:08:32.261,Splashing.
00:08:32.345,00:08:36.641,"She doesn't describe splashes on the wall, she uses a verb in the present tense."
00:08:36.724,00:08:39.018,"She says, Splashing."
00:08:46.651,00:08:47.735,Splashing.
00:08:50.321,00:08:52.949,Beverly Jean was still alive when Rose got there.
00:08:59.330,00:09:01.165,The three of them are in it together.
00:09:01.999,00:09:03.251,That's right.
00:09:15.680,00:09:18.015,Going to dinner at your partner's house.
00:09:18.474,00:09:20.601,You putting on a tie and being all nervous.
00:09:20.685,00:09:22.061,I am not nervous.
00:09:22.895,00:09:25.731,"-If you don't want to go, just say so. -I do want to go."
00:09:26.148,00:09:28.234,"Well, you could be a little less sarcastic."
00:09:28.317,00:09:30.570,What makes you think I'm being sarcastic?
00:09:49.171,00:09:50.256,That's better.
00:10:07.273,00:10:08.899,Hi. Welcome. Please come in.
00:10:08.983,00:10:12.153,Hi! I'm so happy that you're here. Come in.
00:10:12.236,00:10:13.904,-I'm Nancy. -I'm Bill.
00:10:13.988,00:10:15.740,Debbie. I've heard a lot about you.
00:10:15.823,00:10:17.867,I can only imagine what Holden might have said.
00:10:17.950,00:10:21.037,I have been dying to meet you. Isn't it crazy that we haven't met yet?
00:10:21.120,00:10:23.039,"Yes, I've been dying to meet you, too."
00:10:29.337,00:10:31.130,Would you like a glass of wine?
00:10:31.213,00:10:32.173,I'd love one.
00:10:32.256,00:10:34.634,I have so much to talk to you about.
00:10:40.890,00:10:42.099,"Well, hello there."
00:10:43.017,00:10:44.060,"Say hello, Brian."
00:10:52.985,00:10:56.656,I used to see how tall I could make the tower before it fell over.
00:11:02.203,00:11:03.204,May I?
00:11:10.753,00:11:12.129,-Oh! -Uh-oh!
00:11:13.798,00:11:15.466,"Brian, its almost time to brush your teeth."
00:11:18.594,00:11:20.262,"Come on, let's have a drink."
00:11:21.972,00:11:24.850,I'm getting too old for one cheap motel after another.
00:11:24.934,00:11:26.185,One highway grill after another.
00:11:26.268,00:11:28.479,Sports bars. No one can mix a martini.
00:11:28.562,00:11:31.232,Mm! I can mix a martini.
00:11:31.315,00:11:33.567,-Nancy makes the best dry martini. -Is that right?
00:11:37.780,00:11:38.823,What about you?
00:11:39.407,00:11:42.243,-I can't mix a martini. -But he sure can drink 'em.
00:11:43.703,00:11:45.496,Where are you from? Bill never tells me much.
00:11:45.579,00:11:48.290,"I know that you did Road School for a while, but..."
00:11:48.791,00:11:50.042,Does he tell you anything?
00:11:50.126,00:11:52.336,"Oh, yes. Holden loves to talk."
00:11:59.718,00:12:01.971,Mm! Let me guess.
00:12:04.682,00:12:07.685,You're more of a Midwestern kind of guy.
00:12:07.768,00:12:08.811,See?
00:12:08.894,00:12:10.938,"Actually, I was born in Brooklyn."
00:12:13.649,00:12:15.860,I was. I don't know why you always think that's funny.
00:12:19.029,00:12:21.407,Sure. Go ahead and make fun of me.
00:12:25.286,00:12:27.997,He was in an orphanage for 13 months.
00:12:29.373,00:12:32.918,But we haven't been able to find out where he was before then.
00:12:33.586,00:12:35.087,How he got there or...
00:12:40.384,00:12:45.139,"We tried several times, but then we decided to adopt."
00:12:45.222,00:12:48.017,I always thought it was such a beautiful way to help a child.
00:12:49.560,00:12:51.145,I never thought of it like that.
00:12:52.104,00:12:56.650,"If I have to be completely honest, I did it for my own sake."
00:12:58.444,00:12:59.487,Can't it be both?
00:13:02.156,00:13:08.078,Sometimes I wonder if I'm doing it well enough or if it would have been better for him to have gone to somebody else's home.
00:13:09.705,00:13:11.248,I think he's very lucky to have you.
00:13:14.251,00:13:15.252,I don't know.
00:13:15.878,00:13:17.004,How do you tell?
00:13:19.882,00:13:23.093,Sometimes I get up at night and watch him sleeping.
00:13:26.096,00:13:28.599,But I can't help but wonder who he was...
00:13:29.767,00:13:31.060,before we got him.
00:13:34.688,00:13:36.649,What did he see or hear?
00:13:41.529,00:13:43.489,Did anyone hold him when he cried?
00:14:00.631,00:14:01.882,He's beautiful.
00:14:05.135,00:14:08.472,I just wish I knew what went on inside that little head of his.
00:14:12.184,00:14:14.144,"They all have a crazy, angry mother."
00:14:16.355,00:14:18.399,Benjamin only changed after his father took off.
00:14:18.482,00:14:22.319,-Maybe has nothing to do with the mother. -Aren't all fathers absent in some way?
00:14:22.736,00:14:24.446,I know my old man was never around.
00:14:24.530,00:14:30.327,Imagine how different Benjamin and Rose's lives might have been -if their father never left. -Not sure it would've changed much.
00:14:33.330,00:14:36.041,-Your father really didn't speak to you? -No.
00:14:37.209,00:14:38.377,But you speak with Brian.
00:14:42.298,00:14:43.424,You want one more?
00:14:48.596,00:14:51.265,Okay. Has he seen all our notes on the evidence?
00:14:53.559,00:14:55.269,He is going to try Benjamin first.
00:14:55.352,00:14:57.062,Wait a minute. Say that again.
00:14:57.146,00:14:59.273,"He's only gonna try Benjamin, not all three."
00:15:01.358,00:15:05.654,"He's confident after he convicts Benjamin-- Obviously, there's something he doesn't understand."
00:15:05.738,00:15:09.366,"Well, I tried to explain exactly like you said, but he wasn't interested in talking."
00:15:09.450,00:15:11.368,"-Okay, look, I'll call you back. -I'm sorry."
00:15:11.452,00:15:12.745,"Shit, it's not your fault, Mark."
00:15:12.828,00:15:15.122,Let me talk to some folks here and get back to you.
00:15:15.205,00:15:16.999,-Okay. -What's happening?
00:15:17.082,00:15:22.630,"The DA is going after Benjamin first, which means he'll end up offering a plea deal for Frank's and Rose's testimony."
00:15:22.713,00:15:25.257,Did Ocasek tell him about Frank's history of violence?
00:15:26.800,00:15:28.802,"Clearly, he's the most dangerous of the three."
00:15:31.847,00:15:33.307,I have a deposition this afternoon.
00:15:33.390,00:15:35.351,-I can't do anything till tomorrow. -I'll go.
00:15:37.186,00:15:38.520,You better go with him.
00:15:48.238,00:15:53.577,the anger was triggered by stressors that were focused on his fiancé in particular.
00:15:53.661,00:15:54.662,Stressors?
00:15:54.745,00:15:57.456,Dramatic life events. Things that pushed both their buttons.
00:15:57.539,00:16:00.167,Frank Janderman was happily married with a new baby on the way.
00:16:03.170,00:16:06.382,-Is that a motive? -No. It's what we call a stressor.
00:16:07.216,00:16:08.592,So you think Frank did it?
00:16:10.970,00:16:12.888,You're saying Benjamin was provoked by Frank?
00:16:12.972,00:16:14.515,Pushed. Yes.
00:16:14.598,00:16:17.726,Frank saw his chance and raped Beverly Jean.
00:16:20.104,00:16:22.648,"-Situationally? -As opposed to preferential, yes."
00:16:22.731,00:16:25.401,"Well, look it. Here's my question."
00:16:26.527,00:16:27.528,Who killed her?
00:16:27.611,00:16:29.613,All three of them are responsible for her death.
00:16:32.324,00:16:35.369,"Frank and Benjamin left her body at the dump, wrapped up."
00:16:35.452,00:16:38.497,But Benjamin came back a few days later. He couldn't let go.
00:16:38.580,00:16:44.837,"Remember, he was under a lot of stress. He took the knife to her-- Let me stop you there, because... here's the problem."
00:16:44.920,00:16:46.130,How do I prove all this?
00:16:46.213,00:16:49.550,"I'm just here to provide you with intelligent, accurate analysis."
00:16:49.633,00:16:52.928,"If a jury can't understand your analysis, then it's no use to anybody, is it?"
00:16:53.012,00:16:56.306,I agree. But it isn't my job to make the jury understand anything.
00:16:56.390,00:16:57.307,That's your job.
00:16:57.391,00:16:59.685,And we have all placed our trust in you.
00:17:07.609,00:17:11.113,"What you're saying is that both Benjamin and Frank killed her, right?"
00:17:12.656,00:17:17.661,"Benjamin knocked her out because he felt like he was rejected, which is a stressor."
00:17:17.745,00:17:21.331,He tied her up and called his brother-in-law Frank because he didn't know what to do.
00:17:21.415,00:17:25.002,So Frank comes over and takes advantage of the situation and rapes her.
00:17:25.586,00:17:29.006,Benjamin doesn't stop him because he wants to see her humiliated.
00:17:29.089,00:17:33.927,"Now Frank knows that he's in trouble, so he starts telling Benjamin what a slut she is."
00:17:34.011,00:17:36.472,And that is a big problem for Benjamin.
00:17:36.972,00:17:38.015,So they kill her.
00:17:38.098,00:17:40.809,"Then they call Rose, have her come and help clean up."
00:17:40.893,00:17:44.772,And she sees the poor girl in the bathtub and realizes that she's still alive.
00:17:45.355,00:17:46.648,So they stab her again.
00:17:47.232,00:17:49.193,And then they move the body to the dump.
00:17:52.613,00:17:53.655,Okay.
00:17:55.657,00:17:56.784,Okay.
00:17:57.743,00:17:59.536,-That went well. -You think?
00:18:01.580,00:18:04.792,"Sure, I mean... what don't you think he grasped?"
00:18:05.709,00:18:08.337,"Well, I mean, Holden, you know these people. I don't."
00:18:08.712,00:18:13.342,"I think that he seemed very intent on blaming Benjamin, and I'm not quite sure I got him over that."
00:18:14.676,00:18:17.221,"Well, certainly at the end, he seemed very attentive."
00:18:18.055,00:18:22.101,I thought you laid it out clearly and concisely for him that it was all three.
00:18:24.103,00:18:25.521,"Yes, we should be."
00:18:31.693,00:18:33.737,-How's commuting? -What do you mean?
00:18:33.821,00:18:35.614,Having half of your life in Boston.
00:18:36.782,00:18:37.783,What?
00:18:39.701,00:18:41.286,Is the back and forth a strain?
00:18:41.370,00:18:46.166,"I know that it was discombobulating for me, all the travel, when we were straddling Road School."
00:18:48.710,00:18:51.130,Is small talk a way you deal with your anxiety?
00:18:53.298,00:18:55.342,-I suppose. -Hm.
00:18:58.095,00:18:59.138,Okay.
00:20:06.121,00:20:07.456,-Hey. -Hey.
00:20:08.332,00:20:09.666,Thought you were back tomorrow.
00:20:09.750,00:20:11.835,-Was. Plans changed. -Oh.
00:20:11.919,00:20:13.212,We talked about that.
00:20:13.295,00:20:16.298,"Sorry, but I'm so glad you're home early."
00:20:25.474,00:20:26.767,You look tired.
00:20:27.893,00:20:31.021,"I mean, you look great, but also a little tired."
00:20:31.605,00:20:34.024,"Thanks. I, uh... I'm okay."
00:20:34.107,00:20:37.444,"If you want to go home, freshen up, I've got some things to finish here."
00:20:38.528,00:20:40.030,"Oh, yeah. Okay."
00:20:42.032,00:20:44.576,"You know, I actually wanted to talk something over with you."
00:20:46.536,00:20:48.080,-What is it? -Oh.
00:20:48.163,00:20:49.957,"You know, it's fine. It can wait."
00:20:50.540,00:20:53.126,"No. No, come on."
00:20:53.210,00:20:55.254,I don't think he tried to understand.
00:20:55.337,00:20:58.215,He just wanted some buzzwords that he could parrot.
00:20:58.632,00:21:01.551,"Intellectually, these people have reached their limits."
00:21:01.635,00:21:06.556,"They will never understand the discourse on any deeper level, nor will they ever become conversant in your vernacular."
00:21:06.640,00:21:08.642,I actually think they're quite intuitive.
00:21:09.518,00:21:11.186,I'm not talking about my colleagues.
00:21:11.270,00:21:12.437,Your colleagues?
00:21:17.818,00:21:20.070,But that is what I wanted to discuss.
00:21:20.654,00:21:25.409,I'm having a really hard time juggling my research and everything back here.
00:21:25.492,00:21:26.785,I warned you this would happen.
00:21:28.537,00:21:31.748,"Well, I'm torn. And I'm not really delivering either place."
00:21:31.832,00:21:34.543,And I should be spending more time at Quantico.
00:21:34.626,00:21:36.670,I think that's a bad idea.
00:21:40.966,00:21:43.760,"-But you know best. -Well, I'm not sure I do or..."
00:21:43.844,00:21:45.554,It's why I wanted to talk it over.
00:21:46.763,00:21:50.684,I don't have to remind you. Your review is in three months.
00:21:51.935,00:21:54.104,"If you aren't tenured, you'll leave the university."
00:21:54.187,00:21:55.689,"Yeah, you needn't remind me."
00:21:59.484,00:22:00.610,Waste my time?
00:22:02.321,00:22:04.031,Do you think that I'm wasting my time?
00:22:04.114,00:22:06.908,"-Come on, I don't wanna argue about this. -Neither do I."
00:22:07.784,00:22:10.579,"Babe, focus on the thing that will make your career."
00:22:10.662,00:22:12.789,They've offered me a full-time position.
00:22:14.124,00:22:15.167,And?
00:22:17.753,00:22:19.087,You can't be serious.
00:22:19.171,00:22:20.547,Why would you say that?
00:22:24.509,00:22:26.970,these people have reached their intellectual limits.
00:22:27.054,00:22:28.472,"No, I didn't say that."
00:22:31.641,00:22:33.060,Do they know you're lesbian?
00:22:34.186,00:22:37.355,-Of course not. -Exactly. You can't be yourself.
00:22:38.357,00:22:40.984,Are you really going to hide half of your life?
00:22:41.068,00:22:43.070,-I do that here. -What do you mean by that?
00:22:43.153,00:22:48.367,I can't tell any of your friends I work with the FBI -because it could reflect badly on you. -Let's not.
00:22:51.620,00:22:55.415,I told Will and Gore I'd meet them for a glass of wine.
00:22:55.499,00:22:56.541,Please.
00:22:58.043,00:22:59.044,Come with me.
00:23:03.507,00:23:07.427,"in order to avoid embarrassment, either for ourselves or others."
00:23:07.511,00:23:14.851,"The very idea of embarrassing oneself, or others, by being oneself speaks to a deeper treachery."
00:23:14.935,00:23:16.353,Treachery!
00:23:16.436,00:23:25.195,Goffman saw a connection between the kinds of acts or masks that people put on in their daily lives and in theatrical performances.
00:23:25.278,00:23:33.954,"In a social interaction, as in a theatrical performance, there's an onstage area where individuals, or actors as the case may be, appear before the audience."
00:23:34.037,00:23:39.835,"But there must be a backstage, a hidden, private area, where individuals can truly be themselves."
00:23:39.918,00:23:42.712,"Of course, Annaliese, that's lovely, but you're missing the point."
00:23:44.756,00:23:47.342,for anyone in their hidden and private places.
00:23:47.425,00:23:49.678,It's not backstage where the damage is done.
00:24:11.074,00:24:12.242,"What the fuck happened, Mark?"
00:24:12.325,00:24:14.452,-You guys might be too late. -Is he in there?
00:24:14.536,00:24:16.163,-Yeah. -Let's go talk to him.
00:24:16.830,00:24:18.290,I know you came a long way...
00:24:18.373,00:24:20.417,Who doesn't like a four-hour drive in winter?
00:24:22.294,00:24:23.420,till the fat lady sings.
00:24:29.801,00:24:32.012,He just pled guilty to third-degree murder.
00:24:32.470,00:24:35.765,And he is now facing five to 20 years in a state psychiatric hospital.
00:24:35.849,00:24:38.894,-You've misunderstood. -Look. You did a great job.
00:24:39.436,00:24:40.770,And you almost got it right.
00:24:40.854,00:24:42.772,"But it was never Frank, it was all Benjamin."
00:24:42.856,00:24:44.149,You know that's not true.
00:24:45.066,00:24:54.492,You had an expert in psychopathy and sexual homicide from Boston University make a recommendation that Frank motivated Benjamin to commit murder and-- She said he pushed his buttons.
00:24:56.745,00:24:57.996,"Well, guess what?"
00:24:58.079,00:24:59.331,Frank confirmed all that.
00:24:59.414,00:25:03.543,But Dr. Carr got one thing wrong. Frank didn't rape her. Benjamin did.
00:25:03.627,00:25:05.670,The victim was already dead when Frank got there.
00:25:05.754,00:25:10.050,"-Hold on. -She said Benjamin was jealous, sexually frustrated, humiliated."
00:25:10.133,00:25:11.009,That's a motive.
00:25:11.092,00:25:12.969,-You got it all wrong. -I have the report here.
00:25:13.053,00:25:15.722,I've read the report. It points in the opposite direction.
00:25:15.805,00:25:18.558,Benjamin was impotent because of the stressors.
00:25:18.642,00:25:22.020,He was frustrated and humiliated. It was impossible for him to rape the victim.
00:25:22.103,00:25:27.651,"I understand the righteousness of your cause, but this is an exceptionally difficult and disturbing case."
00:25:27.734,00:25:31.613,There's very little forensic evidence. Almost all the evidence is circumstantial.
00:25:31.696,00:25:33.907,You classify our evidence as circumstantial?
00:25:36.201,00:25:38.703,Frank told us where to find the victim's breasts.
00:25:41.081,00:25:46.753,"So, I got a guy who's jealous, sexually frustrated, and we find the victim's breasts buried in his backyard."
00:25:47.212,00:25:49.506,Then I got a guy who's willing to tell us what happened.
00:25:49.589,00:25:53.426,There's a huge difference between killing a woman and mutilating her body after she is dead.
00:25:53.510,00:25:56.888,A plea bargain is the only antidote against a failed prosecution.
00:25:58.723,00:26:01.059,He shouldn't just go to a mental institution for five years.
00:26:04.187,00:26:08.942,And the defense is arguing the state had a duty of care the first time Frank was in the hospital.
00:26:09.025,00:26:11.152,The onus is on the state to make him better.
00:26:11.236,00:26:12.988,He's never going to get better.
00:26:13.738,00:26:15.031,I have to make a phone call.
00:26:38.597,00:26:41.516,"When Wendy explained it to him, he seemed to understand."
00:26:43.018,00:26:45.270,I think he wasn't sure he could convince a jury.
00:26:46.855,00:26:48.648,-This way it's airtight. -He didn't try.
00:26:53.570,00:26:54.988,"No hard feelings, okay?"
00:26:55.405,00:26:57.365,I know the outcome wasn't what you wanted.
00:26:57.449,00:27:00.827,"All three behind bars, and Benjamin'll fry for what he did."
00:27:00.910,00:27:04.998,Not all bad. You know what we're up against.
00:27:05.790,00:27:08.710,We have to consider the attention span of a prospective jury pool.
00:27:08.793,00:27:10.170,Need to keep them in mind.
00:27:14.215,00:27:15.383,You know this is bullshit.
00:27:17.218,00:27:18.553,Let me get you a steak sandwich.
00:27:18.636,00:27:20.555,"Outside of KC, it's the best I've come across."
00:27:20.638,00:27:22.849,"-No, thanks. -I've lost my appetite."
00:27:22.932,00:27:24.392,We need to hit the road.
00:27:25.143,00:27:27.896,Okay. Thank you for everything.
00:27:39.407,00:27:43.662,What difference does any of this make if we can't communicate it to the people who matter?
00:27:45.330,00:27:46.498,I don't know.
00:28:06.142,00:28:10.021,"Refining our methodology, making sure we're airtight and idiot-proof."
00:28:10.105,00:28:11.231,So we need more subjects.
00:28:11.314,00:28:13.608,"-Ones just like Kemper, please. -Those were the days."
00:28:14.567,00:28:22.242,"You know, you're going to see people present with similar pathologies, but the way a person kills is as individual and distinct as the way they have sex."
00:28:22.325,00:28:23.743,And just as complicated.
00:28:24.369,00:28:27.372,Jerome Brudos. King of souvenirs.
00:28:29.541,00:28:33.169,"Six, seven years ago. Sometimes he wore women's dresses."
00:28:36.089,00:28:39.008,-Just like Benjamin. -It's themed. Wendy loves a pattern.
00:28:39.092,00:28:41.052,It's all about finding patterns.
00:28:41.136,00:28:43.138,Except he went a little further than Benjamin.
00:28:43.221,00:28:46.433,He plaster cast the breasts and made them into bronze paperweights.
00:28:46.516,00:28:47.517,He's creative.
00:28:50.812,00:28:54.649,He had a collection of hundreds of women's shoes which he used for masturbation.
00:28:54.733,00:28:57.610,-I think we can learn a lot from this guy. -I'm in.
00:28:58.903,00:29:00.864,This time we use the questionnaire.
00:29:02.824,00:29:03.700,Did we settle on that?
00:29:03.783,00:29:08.747,We have to be able to distinguish the fractal similarities and differences so that we can codify it clearly.
00:29:08.830,00:29:10.707,"Otherwise, we're just wasting our time."
00:29:10.790,00:29:12.751,"Sure, but sometimes you got to go with your gut."
00:29:12.834,00:29:15.462,"And when you first walk in, you can trust your instinct."
00:29:15.545,00:29:20.675,"But once you get your subject talking, we need the protocols so we can build a consistent data set."
00:29:20.759,00:29:23.219,-Makes sense. -What else do we know about Brudos?
00:29:26.431,00:29:30.310,"Soon he was breaking into homes, stealing women's underwear, shoes, and dresses."
00:29:30.393,00:29:33.313,"And then eventually, he escalated to kidnapping and murder."
00:29:33.396,00:29:35.315,But he was married with two children by then.
00:29:35.398,00:29:37.650,This file is as thick as an encyclopedia.
00:29:37.734,00:29:40.153,You think we're gonna get something that isn't in here?
00:29:40.236,00:29:41.446,Absolutely.
00:29:41.529,00:29:48.161,"In all that paperwork, there's not a single word that illuminates what he was thinking or feeling, before, during, or after the crimes."
00:29:48.244,00:29:50.747,"There's nothing on his operation principles, his logic."
00:29:53.041,00:29:55.460,"Which, hopefully, one day we'll be able to decipher."
00:29:57.128,00:29:59.798,"So, we all agreed. Brudos is next."
00:29:59.881,00:30:00.799,Yes.
00:30:01.633,00:30:03.343,Do you mind if I take that room?
00:30:04.219,00:30:06.429,-For what? -For my office.
00:30:11.935,00:30:14.687,"I actually enjoy this part, organizing my space."
00:30:16.606,00:30:17.690,She's staying.
00:30:18.149,00:30:19.484,Carver was right.
00:30:20.360,00:30:22.487,You really are Sherlock Holmes.
00:30:37.377,00:30:40.880,It's one generous bedroom and a newly refurbished kitchenette.
00:30:40.964,00:30:42.257,The building's very quiet.
00:30:42.340,00:30:44.884,Mostly professionals and mostly travelers.
00:30:44.968,00:30:48.596,"Flight attendants, a few pilots. We get the odd lecturer."
00:30:49.389,00:30:50.223,Are you married?
00:30:50.932,00:30:51.891,No.
00:30:51.975,00:30:53.768,Were you thinking month-to-month?
00:30:53.852,00:30:54.978,To begin with.
00:30:55.895,00:30:57.188,-Are they all furnished? -Yes.
00:30:57.272,00:30:59.482,And that's definitely part of the complex's allure.
00:30:59.566,00:31:01.734,Just pick up your keys and off you go.
00:31:03.611,00:31:07.448,"We do have some singles activities, if you're up for that sort of thing."
00:31:07.991,00:31:10.326,And there's access to quite a good tennis pro.
00:31:10.410,00:31:12.161,I'm going to be working long hours.
00:31:13.413,00:31:16.791,"What made you choose this part of Virginia, if you don't mind my asking?"
00:31:17.292,00:31:19.586,-Quantico. -Oh!
00:31:20.628,00:31:22.088,Are you with the Bureau?
00:31:23.840,00:31:26.134,"I guess... uh, mainly research."
00:31:26.217,00:31:27.927,Oh. Very exciting.
00:02:33.736,00:02:36.781,You should've seen that face when he left the ring.
00:02:40.618,00:02:44.247,"The Norton fight, too. Ali didn't have a prayer."
00:02:46.332,00:02:50.837,Kept getting backed up into the corner. His gloves up all around his ears.
00:02:51.546,00:02:54.173,Norton broke Ali's jaw.
00:02:58.261,00:03:01.514,Saw this interview with Ali's trainer.
00:03:02.140,00:03:05.518,He said he didn't know what was wrong.
00:03:06.102,00:03:09.355,The mouthpiece just kept coming out bloody.
00:03:11.774,00:03:18.114,"Oh! Norton got a lot of shots in, but still, that was something."
00:03:20.074,00:03:25.830,It is not an easy thing to break a human being's jaw.
00:03:27.081,00:03:28.541,Let me assure you...
00:03:30.126,00:03:33.129,that takes practice.
00:03:37.926,00:03:40.845,"Hey, welcome to Oregon."
00:03:42.347,00:03:43.431,Thanks.
00:03:45.516,00:03:47.685,"I'm Holden Ford, this is Bill Tench."
00:03:47.769,00:03:50.647,We're with the Federal Bureau of-- Can I get something to drink?
00:03:51.731,00:03:52.815,Sure. Coffee?
00:03:52.899,00:03:55.735,"Coffee's okay, I guess."
00:03:56.277,00:03:58.571,"-Could we get him a coffee, please? -Actually..."
00:03:59.405,00:04:04.077,what I'd really love is some cigarettes and a pizza.
00:04:04.661,00:04:07.163,-Afraid we can't help you with that. -Really?
00:04:08.790,00:04:10.625,We can get you anything in the commissary.
00:04:10.708,00:04:12.752,"Well, fuck you for wasting my time."
00:04:16.005,00:04:18.216,Just messing with you guys.
00:04:21.844,00:04:23.221,Do you mind if we record?
00:04:24.055,00:04:26.474,"I don't know. Tony, do we mind?"
00:04:26.557,00:04:29.143,-You got the paperwork? -This was pre-approved.
00:04:34.774,00:04:36.109,Okay.
00:04:36.192,00:04:40.280,"I'll do it, as long as I know I don't have to."
00:04:43.116,00:04:45.660,"-We'll take it from here. -Yeah, Tony, I'm good."
00:04:56.087,00:04:57.422,Mr. Brudos...
00:04:58.840,00:05:02.343,we are conducting interviews with people who've been convicted of violent crimes.
00:05:02.427,00:05:10.518,What you discuss with us cannot be used against you in your applications-- Electronics these days keep getting smaller.
00:05:10.601,00:05:12.020,Where's the mic?
00:05:12.895,00:05:15.106,See that little shiny part on the top?
00:05:15.815,00:05:17.275,No shit.
00:05:17.358,00:05:20.737,"You should see the cameras coming out, fit in your pocket."
00:05:24.282,00:05:28.328,What you discuss with us cannot be used against you in your applications for parole.
00:05:28.828,00:05:35.835,"We will be asking you about your family history, antecedent behavior, and thought patterns surrounding the crimes you've been convicted of."
00:05:35.918,00:05:40.757,Our goal is to eventually publish a statistical analysis which will not include your name.
00:05:46.220,00:05:48.598,Thought this was gonna break the monotony.
00:05:48.681,00:05:50.850,"We can go straight to the questions, if you prefer."
00:05:50.933,00:05:52.101,Please.
00:05:52.685,00:05:53.686,Okay.
00:05:54.771,00:05:56.689,Let's discuss the pre-crime phase.
00:05:56.773,00:06:00.693,"Specifically, the day before you killed your first victim, Laura Sullivan."
00:06:01.360,00:06:03.112,I didn't kill Laura Sullivan.
00:06:04.155,00:06:05.490,You didn't kill...
00:06:05.573,00:06:09.118,They never found her body. I was never convicted of that murder.
00:06:11.954,00:06:19.378,"On... June 27, 1969, you confessed to murdering Laura Sullivan, Jane Weber, and Kathy Schmidt."
00:06:21.714,00:06:23.591,It was given under coercion.
00:06:23.674,00:06:25.176,You're saying it was forced?
00:06:25.259,00:06:30.014,I am looking at three consecutive life sentences thanks to an elaborate plot by the Portland PD.
00:06:30.932,00:06:33.559,You pleaded guilty to three counts of murder.
00:06:33.643,00:06:36.020,They drugged me. Beat me.
00:06:36.104,00:06:38.064,Wouldn't let me talk to a lawyer.
00:06:38.147,00:06:39.649,Turned away my wife.
00:06:40.566,00:06:43.027,Told me they'd go after my kids if I didn't confess.
00:06:43.111,00:06:45.029,Are you saying you never met Laura Sullivan?
00:06:45.113,00:06:47.865,"Yeah, I met her. She was wandering around my front yard."
00:06:47.949,00:06:49.325,-Selling encyclopedias. -That's right.
00:06:49.408,00:06:51.744,-That part of the confession is correct? -Sure.
00:06:52.537,00:06:54.163,You said...
00:06:55.623,00:06:56.624,she was lost.
00:06:56.707,00:06:59.460,"It was raining, she couldn't find the right address."
00:06:59.544,00:07:01.963,But you told her that you ordered the encyclopedias.
00:07:02.046,00:07:02.964,Nope.
00:07:03.673,00:07:04.674,You didn't say that?
00:07:04.757,00:07:05.925,We got to chatting.
00:07:07.051,00:07:08.970,She was an aspiring model.
00:07:09.053,00:07:12.640,"Not surprising, she was beautiful."
00:07:14.559,00:07:16.519,I said I'd take some photos of her.
00:07:18.312,00:07:20.690,"Is that when you invited her in, took her to the garage?"
00:07:20.773,00:07:21.607,Yep.
00:07:21.691,00:07:23.776,Sent your wife and children out to get hamburgers?
00:07:23.860,00:07:25.194,I thought we could use privacy.
00:07:25.278,00:07:27.530,Then you hit her with a two-by-four?
00:07:31.159,00:07:33.619,"Actually, I realized I didn't have any film."
00:07:34.245,00:07:36.789,"I apologized for wasting her time, showed her out."
00:07:38.708,00:07:39.709,Okay.
00:07:41.252,00:07:45.381,The day before you met Laura Sullivan. Can you tell me what you were feeling?
00:07:48.718,00:07:51.095,Got my first camera at 15.
00:07:51.179,00:07:52.513,You're into ladies' fashions?
00:07:52.597,00:07:55.766,"Mm... it's women, isn't it? Can't call them ladies anymore."
00:07:55.850,00:07:57.226,Women's fashions.
00:07:57.310,00:07:59.687,"I've got my magazine subscriptions, I know what's going on."
00:08:03.191,00:08:04.192,Shoe catalogs.
00:08:04.275,00:08:05.359,It's my smut.
00:08:05.443,00:08:06.986,So you masturbate to it?
00:08:07.778,00:08:09.322,That's usually how it works.
00:08:09.405,00:08:11.407,Did you masturbate to the photos of your victims?
00:08:11.949,00:08:13.993,I'm not sure what you're talking about.
00:08:14.076,00:08:16.245,The photos the police found in your garage?
00:08:20.208,00:08:22.835,They're sloppy. I didn't take those.
00:08:25.505,00:08:27.006,"Holden, maybe you can find it."
00:08:40.228,00:08:41.062,I don't remember.
00:08:42.104,00:08:44.565,"Ever since the kids were small, I get these blackouts."
00:08:44.649,00:08:46.400,"It's hypoglycemia, low blood sugar."
00:08:46.484,00:08:50.112,I could walk off the roof of a building and not know it.
00:08:52.782,00:08:53.699,You see that?
00:08:55.159,00:08:56.827,That's you in the photo.
00:08:57.495,00:08:59.455,Which means you took this photo.
00:09:00.331,00:09:01.916,Which means you killed that girl.
00:09:04.961,00:09:06.546,"Boy, oh, boy."
00:09:08.422,00:09:09.465,Kemper was right.
00:09:10.383,00:09:11.300,Kemper?
00:09:15.304,00:09:18.224,But I'd call you fucking morons.
00:09:20.268,00:09:22.478,Big Ed with his big mouth.
00:09:23.312,00:09:28.859,I bet you swallowed every fucking line that came out of him.
00:09:28.943,00:09:30.403,And he must have loved it.
00:09:30.486,00:09:34.448,"Wait a minute. As far as I know, all his communication is monitored."
00:09:34.532,00:09:36.158,What can I say?
00:09:36.242,00:09:38.411,Prisons are like knitting circles.
00:09:46.919,00:09:48.546,Fuck if I know. We should find out.
00:09:48.629,00:09:51.799,"Well, yeah. It's got to affect the study if our subjects are all pen pals."
00:09:51.882,00:09:54.010,I'll call the superintendent at Vacaville.
00:09:54.302,00:09:55.886,Or let's just go back and ask.
00:09:56.637,00:10:00.057,What are the chances the warden's gonna know what's going on?
00:10:00.141,00:10:01.434,You might as well call.
00:10:01.517,00:10:03.644,Do you really think that Kemper called us idiots?
00:10:04.228,00:10:05.855,It doesn't sound like Ed to me.
00:10:08.733,00:10:11.319,"We could phone Kemper, ask him directly."
00:10:11.402,00:10:14.655,-Ask him if he called us idiots? -If he talks to Brudos.
00:10:14.739,00:10:16.616,Then we would be idiots.
00:10:16.699,00:10:19.327,Excuse me. I believe I'm in the middle seat.
00:10:19.410,00:10:22.288,"Oh, yeah? Well, that's all right. You can have the aisle."
00:10:25.041,00:10:28.127,"It's okay. My partner and I need to talk, works out for both of us."
00:10:29.629,00:10:33.090,I really think it's best if I sat in the seat that's on my ticket.
00:10:41.057,00:10:42.266,Thank you.
00:10:55.738,00:10:56.822,"Hey, Holden."
00:10:58.115,00:10:59.325,Does this turn you on?
00:11:04.330,00:11:05.956,How different is it from this?
00:11:07.958,00:11:09.585,I'd say it's pretty different.
00:11:10.252,00:11:11.587,"To us, maybe."
00:11:12.254,00:11:13.255,This one...
00:11:13.339,00:11:15.758,"This could be in Playboy, easy."
00:11:17.301,00:11:19.178,"Movies, TV."
00:11:19.261,00:11:21.305,Classic damsel in distress.
00:11:24.892,00:11:26.310,All men are pervs?
00:11:26.394,00:11:28.813,"No, but sex is our trigger."
00:11:29.397,00:11:30.773,I'm sure Wendy has a theory.
00:11:37.696,00:11:40.032,Please. I can switch with you.
00:11:40.658,00:11:42.201,I'm enjoying the leg room.
00:11:55.005,00:11:56.715,-Fascinating. -You think so?
00:11:59.093,00:12:01.595,Hypoglycemia? Is he lying or denying?
00:12:01.679,00:12:02.888,My vote's with lying.
00:12:03.931,00:12:05.891,We can learn from what he doesn't tell us.
00:12:08.310,00:12:10.271,"Well, yeah, the whole talking to Kemper thing."
00:12:10.354,00:12:12.898,We called around. There's no evidence they were in touch.
00:12:12.982,00:12:15.651,"-Which doesn't mean they haven't. -God, if only..."
00:12:16.110,00:12:18.154,"If they're corresponding, it could screw up our thing."
00:12:18.237,00:12:19.071,Really?
00:12:21.824,00:12:24.660,Wouldn't it be... cross-contamination?
00:12:24.743,00:12:26.620,What would these two guys talk about?
00:12:26.704,00:12:28.706,Would Brudos share with Kemper everything he's done?
00:12:34.336,00:12:36.088,Kemper is overly forthcoming.
00:12:36.172,00:12:39.258,"Brudos denies everything, even when confronted with evidence."
00:12:40.718,00:12:46.056,It's a new behavior to sort by: post-conviction admission or non-admission of guilt.
00:12:46.140,00:12:47.141,You're excited about this.
00:12:48.058,00:12:48.893,I am.
00:12:51.645,00:12:52.688,"I'm telling you, you did."
00:12:52.771,00:12:56.233,"Maybe in an academic sense, but this isn't only about your study."
00:12:57.526,00:13:00.029,"Once we've collected all the data, we can all apply it."
00:13:00.112,00:13:01.822,"You mean, in four years?"
00:13:02.239,00:13:03.657,I need coffee.
00:13:10.247,00:13:12.708,-The way he lies is very interesting. -How so?
00:13:12.791,00:13:14.210,"Well, it's just so exaggerated."
00:13:14.293,00:13:16.086,He can't possibly expect you to believe him.
00:13:16.170,00:13:19.423,"We called him on a lie, showed him evidence, and that ended the interview."
00:13:19.507,00:13:21.091,So don't back him into a corner.
00:13:21.175,00:13:23.761,"Guys, post-conviction sorting? What good is that?"
00:13:23.844,00:13:25.930,"We need pre-apprehension info, not post."
00:13:30.601,00:13:33.229,I bet you dinner that this guy's got more to add.
00:13:35.147,00:13:38.108,You read the story about the girl he held at knifepoint when he was 15?
00:13:38.192,00:13:40.486,"Made her undress, took pictures, locked her in a corncrib."
00:13:40.569,00:13:42.530,Then pretended to be his own twin brother.
00:13:44.240,00:13:46.325,-That shows how fucked up he is. -Maybe.
00:13:46.408,00:13:48.827,"There's something about disguise, pretending to be someone else."
00:13:48.911,00:13:50.454,It gives him room for what?
00:13:51.664,00:13:53.958,He said he started blacking out when his kids were small.
00:13:54.041,00:13:56.293,So he isn't averse to talking about his family.
00:13:56.377,00:13:58.045,"Bill, you could talk about your son."
00:13:58.128,00:13:59.713,-No. -Try.
00:14:01.549,00:14:04.218,"Well, you don't have to talk about your family. You can make one up."
00:14:04.301,00:14:06.053,It's just about building rapport.
00:14:06.136,00:14:10.099,"And he asked for stuff, cigarettes and pizza. Indulge him."
00:14:14.603,00:14:16.522,-When do you want to go back? -I don't.
00:14:17.231,00:14:18.065,Next week?
00:14:20.192,00:14:21.068,Sure.
00:14:27.741,00:14:30.828,"Hey, Holden. I asked a buddy of mine with the Portland PD."
00:14:30.911,00:14:31.954,You might want to...
00:14:33.664,00:14:34.623,On two.
00:14:53.142,00:14:55.561,-Mrs. Darcie Cooke? -Yes?
00:14:55.644,00:14:58.731,"Hi. My name is Bill Tench, I'm with the FBI."
00:15:01.066,00:15:02.276,Is this about Jer?
00:15:02.359,00:15:04.987,"About your ex-husband, Mr. Brudos."
00:15:08.407,00:15:11.035,"Well, no, but I only have a couple of questions."
00:15:11.118,00:15:13.996,"I'm sorry, I changed my last name for a reason."
00:15:19.335,00:15:21.420,"She said, Is this about Jer?"
00:15:21.921,00:15:22.880,Jer.
00:15:24.632,00:15:27.426,Those shirts looked good on you. I can't believe you didn't buy them.
00:15:27.885,00:15:29.261,I don't like patterns.
00:15:29.762,00:15:32.264,You know you dress the same off-duty as on-duty?
00:15:32.348,00:15:33.974,I'm wearing plain clothes.
00:15:34.058,00:15:35.976,"Yeah, plain is right."
00:15:50.282,00:15:53.035,-Are you sure? I usually wear a seven. -Hmm.
00:15:58.540,00:16:01.877,Okay. Tell you what. I'll bring out seven-and-a-half in all these.
00:16:07.091,00:16:09.969,"Well, it's just half a size. It's not that big a deal."
00:16:10.052,00:16:11.303,I don't want big feet.
00:16:12.137,00:16:15.391,"-You do not have big feet. -That's right, and I don't want them."
00:16:18.394,00:16:20.521,-No way. -Come on.
00:16:21.146,00:16:22.564,I don't need new shoes.
00:16:23.190,00:16:24.233,Please.
00:16:39.331,00:16:41.250,-You look bitchin'. -Can I take it off now?
00:16:41.333,00:16:43.669,-You don't like them? -I look like a Village Person.
00:16:43.752,00:16:44.753,Ugh! Holden.
00:16:53.971,00:16:55.931,"-Excuse me, sir. -Yes."
00:16:56.724,00:16:59.435,Could you tell me the largest size you have of that shoe?
00:17:00.978,00:17:03.272,-Yeah. -I'm not sure. I have to go take a look.
00:17:03.355,00:17:05.190,Could you put a pair on hold for me?
00:17:06.275,00:17:07.109,Sure.
00:17:35.679,00:17:37.306,"Hello, ladies."
00:17:38.182,00:17:39.391,Back for more?
00:17:45.064,00:17:46.190,Great.
00:17:50.736,00:17:51.612,Want to arm wrestle?
00:17:53.197,00:17:54.406,How about a smoke?
00:17:55.616,00:17:57.242,"Well, well, well."
00:17:59.870,00:18:01.330,I want him to light me.
00:18:05.959,00:18:07.169,How'd you get that scar?
00:18:08.545,00:18:09.838,Darcie...
00:18:09.922,00:18:13.008,found out I was chasing skirt at OSU.
00:18:13.092,00:18:15.636,"-Came after me with a Ginsu. -No, really."
00:18:15.719,00:18:17.012,God's truth.
00:18:17.930,00:18:19.765,She loved horror films.
00:18:20.516,00:18:22.017,We'd appreciate honesty.
00:18:22.101,00:18:23.310,About my scar?
00:18:25.646,00:18:28.065,We know that you've been jumped in here a few times.
00:18:29.858,00:18:32.986,"If you got all the answers, what do you need from me?"
00:18:33.070,00:18:35.656,-We want details. -We want to know why.
00:18:36.657,00:18:38.242,Let's start with the women's clothes.
00:18:38.325,00:18:40.285,Could you be more specific?
00:18:45.249,00:18:46.834,Hmm... she said...
00:18:48.293,00:18:50.879,whatever the police wanted her to say.
00:18:50.963,00:18:53.924,But you did approach her dressed as a woman.
00:18:55.717,00:18:58.178,-What's your wife's name? -None of your business.
00:18:58.262,00:18:59.847,I appreciate honesty.
00:19:02.599,00:19:03.433,Nancy.
00:19:04.101,00:19:07.813,How does Nancy deal with things that she doesn't understand?
00:19:07.896,00:19:09.148,I don't follow.
00:19:09.231,00:19:10.983,"Let's just say, my wife..."
00:19:12.776,00:19:14.611,was less than adventurous.
00:19:14.695,00:19:18.157,-You were young when you got married. -Twenty-two. She was 17.
00:19:18.490,00:19:20.826,-What was it about her? -She popped my cherry.
00:19:22.452,00:19:24.705,You married the first girl you had sex with?
00:19:24.788,00:19:27.082,It wasn't that unusual in 1961.
00:19:27.166,00:19:30.794,But you had... interests by then.
00:19:31.295,00:19:33.630,Stealing lingerie off of clotheslines.
00:19:33.714,00:19:36.717,You photographed a neighborhood girl naked when you were 15.
00:19:36.800,00:19:39.469,"Just a healthy, red-blooded American male."
00:19:42.055,00:19:43.307,In your garage.
00:19:45.017,00:19:47.352,The wife loved to shop.
00:19:47.436,00:19:50.772,There were nearly a hundred pairs. Most of them size 16.
00:19:53.275,00:19:54.860,-Friends? -That's right.
00:20:00.282,00:20:02.576,Started as a goof. Got out of hand.
00:20:02.659,00:20:03.619,That's interesting.
00:20:05.996,00:20:07.748,-What's that? -Hmm?
00:20:10.584,00:20:12.544,A reward for honesty.
00:20:15.672,00:20:18.842,"What can I say, I'm a collector."
00:20:18.926,00:20:20.010,Do you wear them?
00:20:20.093,00:20:21.595,I don't have to.
00:20:21.678,00:20:23.639,"Don't have to, to what?"
00:20:24.264,00:20:26.099,-You know. -Get off.
00:20:27.017,00:20:27.851,He's adorable.
00:20:27.935,00:20:30.145,I thought wearing them was part of the allure?
00:20:32.272,00:20:35.525,-Why's he so interested? -I'm really just asking for Darcie.
00:20:35.609,00:20:38.153,She still doesn't get it. We caught up on the phone.
00:20:38.237,00:20:39.738,-Right. -Nice woman.
00:20:41.073,00:20:42.241,My wife...
00:20:43.075,00:20:44.409,wouldn't talk about me.
00:20:44.493,00:20:45.327,Ex-wife.
00:20:47.496,00:20:48.997,And change her last name?
00:20:50.457,00:20:53.043,I'm sure it makes it easier for them in school.
00:20:55.045,00:20:58.131,Not just about the murders. How do you explain the cross-dressing?
00:20:58.215,00:21:00.425,Dad's a tranny? Dad's a fag?
00:21:00.509,00:21:01.969,"Fuck you, man."
00:21:02.052,00:21:04.346,How does it fucking work with the shoes?
00:21:05.055,00:21:07.599,He is dying to know.
00:21:07.683,00:21:11.144,"I'll pass it along to Darcie. Ten years later, she's still confused."
00:21:11.228,00:21:14.273,-Give her my love. -I'll do that... Jer.
00:21:18.318,00:21:19.194,Tony! Hey!
00:21:19.861,00:21:21.363,-Get in here! -What are you doing?
00:21:27.995,00:21:29.830,"Bill, tell him."
00:21:29.913,00:21:32.916,We didn't talk to your stupid wife. She hung up on us.
00:21:56.773,00:21:58.692,Ah...
00:22:00.068,00:22:01.153,Brand new.
00:22:11.246,00:22:13.749,You should have brought me a pair of Nancy's.
00:22:27.054,00:22:30.182,"So when did it start, your interest in women's shoes?"
00:22:30.265,00:22:32.184,It didn't start. It was always there.
00:22:33.143,00:22:37.522,There must have been a moment during puberty when it became... sexual.
00:22:37.606,00:22:39.733,I got my first pair of heels at five.
00:22:39.816,00:22:40.692,Five?
00:22:44.071,00:22:46.490,"Found them in the junkyard, brought 'em home."
00:22:47.657,00:22:50.702,"Never seen anything like 'em before, except in pictures."
00:22:52.704,00:22:53.705,Never.
00:22:55.499,00:22:57.125,What'd she think when you brought them home?
00:23:04.966,00:23:07.219,"One time, my mom walked in on me jacking off."
00:23:07.969,00:23:08.929,Came into my bedroom.
00:23:09.012,00:23:11.390,-I hadn't locked the door. -Really?
00:23:12.808,00:23:13.934,-Yeah. -What'd she do?
00:23:14.476,00:23:16.269,I'd never seen her so shocked.
00:23:16.353,00:23:19.231,It's like I was doing something too horrible to even imagine.
00:23:19.314,00:23:20.857,She thought I needed help.
00:23:21.274,00:23:23.235,She offered to help?
00:23:27.948,00:23:31.827,-My mom burned the shoes. -The stilettos?
00:23:31.910,00:23:36.164,"Dragged me into the backyard, poured kerosene all over 'em, lit 'em up."
00:23:41.503,00:23:43.296,She wanted you to be a girl?
00:23:43.380,00:23:45.590,"She had my brother, that's what she wanted next."
00:23:45.674,00:23:47.717,-She told you this? -All the time.
00:23:47.801,00:23:50.053,Why was she so upset when you brought home the shoes?
00:23:50.846,00:23:52.931,I was wearing 'em around the house.
00:23:56.476,00:23:57.310,What?
00:23:57.978,00:24:00.188,Were you trying to be a girl?
00:24:02.983,00:24:06.361,"Fuck no, I never wanted to be a girl."
00:24:06.945,00:24:08.989,I liked the shoes.
00:24:09.072,00:24:11.658,I didn't know why she was so angry.
00:24:11.741,00:24:15.078,"I took a pair of my teacher's shoes, and she didn't lose her fucking mind."
00:24:15.162,00:24:16.246,Your teacher's shoes?
00:24:16.329,00:24:18.206,Mrs. Kernegan. First grade.
00:24:19.374,00:24:22.335,-She'd kick her shoes off under the desk. -Heels?
00:24:22.419,00:24:25.255,"Low, but stylish. She checked our book bags."
00:24:25.338,00:24:31.136,"When she found them on me, I thought she'd go berserk, but... she was just curious."
00:24:31.219,00:24:33.221,-About what? -Why I had taken them.
00:24:37.767,00:24:40.228,"Women always want to know, don't they?"
00:24:40.979,00:24:43.356,-At least they think they do. -Did Darcie want to know?
00:24:46.985,00:24:48.695,It's tricky when you're married.
00:24:49.529,00:24:52.282,You either have to deny yourself or...
00:24:52.866,00:24:54.409,keep a private space.
00:24:54.492,00:24:55.619,Like a golf course.
00:24:57.829,00:25:03.001,"I put a lock on the garage, installed an intercom so she could call in if she needed something from the freezer."
00:25:08.006,00:25:11.468,She would not have wanted that.
00:25:43.333,00:25:44.167,Tony!
00:25:44.876,00:25:47.254,"-That was amazing. -Yeah, that was great."
00:25:47.337,00:25:49.422,All that shit about his mom burning the shoes.
00:25:49.506,00:25:50.465,Uh-huh.
00:25:51.132,00:25:52.425,The high heels worked.
00:25:52.509,00:25:53.802,You could say that.
00:25:54.511,00:25:55.762,Let me ask you something.
00:25:56.304,00:25:58.431,Was that true about your mom walking in on you?
00:25:58.515,00:26:00.892,"-Yeah. -It didn't bother you, using that?"
00:26:00.976,00:26:03.562,Who doesn't have a weird story about their mom and sex?
00:26:03.853,00:26:07.649,"You're telling a private, personal story to a murderous asshole."
00:26:10.610,00:26:11.653,It bothered me.
00:26:25.542,00:26:30.922,"Nothing wrong with-- If what we're doing doesn't get under your skin, you're more screwed up than I thought or kidding yourself."
00:28:22.242,00:28:23.076,Hello?
00:29:57.086,00:30:00.757,"Jesus, Nancy. I don't know what to say."
00:30:00.840,00:30:03.259,"Well, I was hoping for a little more than that."
00:30:03.343,00:30:05.178,I can't talk about this now. Okay?
00:30:05.261,00:30:07.764,Brian's teacher thinks we're not paying enough attention to this.
00:30:08.556,00:30:10.433,That's why he's acting out.
00:30:13.853,00:30:16.648,"Is that a Uh-huh, I know, or is that Uh-huh, uh-huh?"
00:30:16.731,00:30:18.066,The first.
00:30:20.026,00:30:21.945,You want to go to Lamplighter tonight or not?
00:30:22.028,00:30:24.197,Sure. But why are you being like this?
00:30:24.280,00:30:26.991,"Like I said, I really can't talk about this now. Okay?"
00:30:27.700,00:30:29.244,-Did you finish it? -I did.
00:30:30.537,00:30:32.330,"It's pretty great, right?"
00:30:32.413,00:30:34.499,Can you believe what he said about his mom?
00:30:37.377,00:30:39.212,-Did you listen to it? -Mm-hmm.
00:30:41.381,00:30:43.258,What's in the box?
00:30:43.341,00:30:45.802,Holden's idea. You figure it out?
00:30:51.558,00:30:54.310,"No, you baited him with those shoes and you lied to him about his wife."
00:30:54.394,00:30:57.146,"He pulled that bullshit about Kemper, so we used the same tactic."
00:30:57.230,00:31:00.608,-So it was revenge? -No. Speaking his language.
00:31:00.692,00:31:02.986,"This is a scientific study, not a locker room hazing."
00:31:04.571,00:31:06.948,Guys communicate in a certain way.
00:31:07.031,00:31:10.368,"It can be rough, but it's like a code, it gets out the conflict."
00:31:10.451,00:31:12.745,"Well, thank you for illuminating me on male rituals."
00:31:13.204,00:31:15.164,You threw our questionnaire right out the window.
00:31:15.248,00:31:16.833,"Your questionnaire, which wasn't working."
00:31:16.916,00:31:19.919,All you wanted to do was force him to admit that he wears women's clothes.
00:31:20.003,00:31:22.046,"Yeah, get under his disguise."
00:31:24.340,00:31:29.470,"His fixation on women's clothes, women's bodies, wanting to own them, wanting to inhabit them."
00:31:29.554,00:31:32.265,"If we can understand that, we can recognize it in another killer."
00:31:32.348,00:31:36.060,Cross-dressing is not an antecedent to homicidal behavior.
00:31:36.144,00:31:37.020,I didn't say that.
00:31:37.103,00:31:39.689,"For most people, it's a harmless form of expression."
00:31:39.772,00:31:41.274,-Most people? -Those who do it.
00:31:41.357,00:31:44.527,"But it's usually sexual, right? And we know sex drives our subjects."
00:31:44.611,00:31:45.820,It's sometimes sexual.
00:31:45.904,00:31:49.908,"Transvestism has been practiced in every era, -in every human culture. -Come on."
00:31:49.991,00:31:51.993,"If you want to teach a class, go back to Boston."
00:31:52.076,00:31:53.745,"No, you weren't speaking his language."
00:31:53.828,00:31:57.832,You were persecuting him about something that challenges your masculinity.
00:31:57.916,00:31:59.709,-What? -That interview was personal.
00:31:59.792,00:32:02.670,"-No, this is personal. -Guys."
00:32:02.754,00:32:04.380,"-You're being irrational. -Oh, Jesus."
00:32:04.464,00:32:05.965,-Where's this coming from? -I don't know.
00:32:06.049,00:32:08.509,Maybe shock at your total lack of objectivity.
00:32:08.593,00:32:10.178,-We were supposed to be objective? -Mm-hmm.
00:32:10.261,00:32:13.598,I seem to remember you encouraging us to use our families to get to him.
00:32:13.681,00:32:16.017,-How objective is that? -We have to use strategies.
00:32:16.100,00:32:24.901,"I said use fake information, as long as you establish rapport-- It is not possible to communicate with someone like Brudos and be fake."
00:32:24.984,00:32:29.030,"We can hassle him or we can open up to him, but either option has a cost."
00:32:37.163,00:32:38.790,She comes highly recommended.
00:32:38.873,00:32:41.376,She has like ten years of experience-- Oh.
00:32:48.007,00:32:48.925,Thank you.
00:32:50.635,00:32:53.388,"The only thing is, she's in Charlottesville."
00:32:54.347,00:32:56.182,I looked for someone in D.C.
00:32:59.477,00:33:04.148,"with all the politicians' kids there, but maybe it's considered too alternative."
00:33:05.233,00:33:08.027,I don't know that she's a hippie. I only talked to her on the phone.
00:33:08.111,00:33:11.197,But she... she sounded very nice.
00:33:11.906,00:33:12.907,Professional.
00:33:20.206,00:33:21.749,I could drive him there once a week.
00:33:21.833,00:33:26.796,"Maybe even get him out of school a little early, which could also be a good thing, after what happened today."
00:33:30.133,00:33:32.176,-How much is she? -Forty-five.
00:33:33.594,00:33:34.846,An hour?
00:33:34.929,00:33:36.264,An hour and a half.
00:33:37.682,00:33:40.685,"-Nancy, that's a lot. -You spend that much on a golf club."
00:33:41.728,00:33:44.105,"Yeah, but when you buy a club, you have the club."
00:33:47.358,00:33:51.696,"I got a recommendation for a child psychologist in Woodbridge, much closer."
00:33:52.613,00:33:54.866,-You got a recommendation? When? -Mm-hmm.
00:33:54.949,00:33:56.576,About a month ago.
00:33:56.659,00:33:57.869,Why didn't you tell me?
00:33:58.369,00:34:00.663,Because I really don't want to send him to a shrink.
00:34:00.747,00:34:04.792,"-Me neither. -But at that price, I'd rather send him to a doctor than some hippie musician."
00:34:04.876,00:34:07.378,Please. This is not about the money.
00:34:07.462,00:34:08.546,Of course not.
00:34:10.048,00:34:11.049,I was...
00:34:14.761,00:34:16.679,I was hoping it wouldn't go this far.
00:34:53.633,00:34:54.926,It's a private school.
00:34:55.593,00:34:58.304,"If he keeps biting other children, he's gonna get kicked out."
00:34:58.387,00:35:00.848,"He's getting bullied, so he's defending himself."
00:35:05.311,00:35:07.522,"He's fine with me, he's great with Julie."
00:35:13.027,00:35:17.657,I've read a couple of books which recommend music therapy when a child needs communication training.
00:35:17.740,00:35:20.785,Communication training. Is that what the books call it?
00:35:20.868,00:35:22.995,Sure describes what we need.
00:35:24.080,00:35:26.791,"I'm exhausted, Nancy. Could we table this for tonight?"
00:35:33.589,00:35:34.882,Let's work on these ropes.
00:35:37.135,00:35:38.010,"Hi, Julie."
00:35:45.101,00:35:46.394,Hey.
00:35:46.936,00:35:48.312,Is everything okay?
00:35:49.063,00:35:50.064,Is Brian all right?
00:35:52.817,00:35:54.318,Did something happen?
00:35:54.402,00:35:57.655,"When I was putting him to bed, I found something under it."
00:35:59.866,00:36:01.159,so here's a little bonus.
00:36:12.086,00:36:13.254,"Julie, I'm so sorry."
00:36:13.796,00:36:17.049,You know I'm an FBI agent. I work on some rough cases.
00:36:17.133,00:36:19.927,He must have got this out of my office. I should lock that file cabinet.
00:36:20.011,00:36:22.013,"Honey, you shouldn't have had to see that."
00:36:22.096,00:36:23.181,"Brian saw it, too."
00:36:23.264,00:36:24.223,Of course.
00:36:25.099,00:36:27.185,-We really messed up. -I messed up.
00:36:27.268,00:36:28.436,He gets into things.
00:36:30.021,00:36:34.066,"-We'll find a way to explain it. -I'll talk to him, make sure he understands there's nothing wrong."
00:36:34.859,00:36:37.612,"-Nothing's wrong? -Honey, come here."
00:36:39.405,00:36:41.240,-Are you all right? -Um...
00:36:41.324,00:36:50.708,"I've been meaning to tell you, my parents want me to get some real job experience, so I'm applying at the mall and-- But you'd still be able to sit for us sometimes, right?"
00:36:51.292,00:36:53.085,I think it's going to be hard.
00:36:56.172,00:36:57.715,you've been with us for years.
00:36:58.341,00:36:59.717,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Tench."
00:37:04.180,00:37:05.973,Please say goodbye to Brian for me.
00:37:06.933,00:37:17.401,Julie-- I know that file cabinet has a lock. I just have to find the key.
00:37:18.569,00:37:19.862,Or get a new one.
00:37:20.404,00:37:21.989,That one's 20 years old.
00:37:25.660,00:37:27.119,Maybe I should get a safe.
00:37:28.663,00:37:30.122,Why is it in the house at all?
00:37:31.958,00:37:34.001,It's work. I have to bring it home sometimes.
00:37:34.085,00:37:36.462,That? You have to bring that home?
00:37:37.713,00:37:38.923,What do you do with it?
00:37:39.674,00:37:41.676,Examine it for clues.
00:37:43.261,00:37:45.513,You don't tell me a thing about what you do.
00:37:46.097,00:37:46.931,Now you know why.
00:37:47.473,00:37:49.684,-You don't need to protect me. -I'm trying to protect everybody.
00:37:49.767,00:37:52.061,"No, you need to protect your son."
00:37:53.020,00:37:55.523,What was he doing in my office in the first place?
00:37:56.524,00:38:00.111,We can't watch him every second. He's always trying to get in there.
00:38:00.194,00:38:01.612,Because he knows it's not allowed.
00:38:01.696,00:38:04.615,-I should put a lock on the door. -He's trying to get closer to you!
00:38:05.783,00:38:07.618,Sometimes I find him in our closet.
00:38:07.702,00:38:10.538,He's putting on your ties. He's walking around in your shoes.
00:38:13.082,00:38:15.876,I'm here on the weekends now. I'm putting in the time.
00:38:15.960,00:38:19.380,"When you're not at the golf course, you're angling to get there."
00:38:20.506,00:38:22.508,"When you're playing with him, you check your watch."
00:38:22.591,00:38:25.845,"-Well, to be honest, he's not much fun. -He's not much fun?!"
00:38:25.928,00:38:27.972,"I know how that sounds, but I've tried."
00:38:28.055,00:38:31.267,"-He's just not interested. -It takes more than turning up, Bill."
00:38:31.600,00:38:35.104,"Okay, you... you need to play with him."
00:38:35.187,00:38:38.232,I can't have a conversation with him. I can't get a hug out of him.
00:38:38.316,00:38:40.234,I can't even get him to look me in the eye.
00:38:40.318,00:38:42.486,"-He is not beyond hope. -Well, maybe I am."
00:38:43.321,00:38:44.488,Want to know what I do?
00:38:44.572,00:38:46.907,Want to see what I work on every night? Come on.
00:38:51.370,00:38:53.789,A young mother with a boy Brian's age.
00:38:53.873,00:38:55.750,Killer did the same thing to him.
00:38:55.833,00:38:58.419,You want to see that photo? I got it here somewhere.
00:38:59.045,00:39:00.463,This one's interesting.
00:39:00.546,00:39:03.257,"A woman who was stabbed, raped, breasts cut off."
00:39:03.341,00:39:06.010,"Turns out it was her boyfriend, his brother, and their sister."
00:39:06.093,00:39:07.386,A little family affair.
00:39:08.095,00:39:11.349,Here's the one I'm working on now. Lovely guy by the name of Jerry Brudos.
00:39:11.432,00:39:13.559,Murdered four women not much older than Julie.
00:39:15.519,00:39:18.939,One of them came to his door accidentally. One of them had car trouble.
00:39:19.023,00:39:23.319,One of them he grabbed from a parking garage on her way to lunch with her mom.
00:39:35.373,00:39:36.374,I'm sorry.
00:39:37.208,00:39:38.209,I know.
00:39:41.879,00:39:43.089,I'm sorry.
00:41:15.723,00:41:16.891,Your favorite...
00:41:18.976,00:41:20.478,Quantico Blend.
00:41:23.481,00:41:24.398,Thank you.
00:41:28.736,00:41:30.863,-The mom. -Hmm?
00:41:30.946,00:41:32.698,The mom and the shoes.
00:41:33.365,00:41:34.742,Something happened there.
00:41:36.577,00:41:37.578,Clearly.
00:41:40.122,00:41:41.207,What was it?
00:41:42.082,00:41:43.209,Her reaction?
00:41:47.463,00:41:48.631,The force of it.
00:41:49.757,00:41:52.718,Burning the shoes seared them into his mind as forbidden.
00:41:54.678,00:41:56.764,Which became part of the sexual fantasy.
00:41:58.974,00:42:01.644,Then the teacher had an entirely different reaction.
00:42:01.852,00:42:06.148,So he's getting mixed messages from two adult women about his impulses.
00:42:09.068,00:42:13.280,Brudos said that he was attracted to women's shoes before all of that.
00:42:14.281,00:42:16.575,He took the stilettos from the dump when he was five.
00:42:17.159,00:42:23.999,"Not everyone agrees with Freud's theories on sexuality, but he did hit upon how young we are when we start to form preferences."
00:42:24.083,00:42:25.501,So when did that come in?
00:42:26.627,00:42:28.796,How did it get tied to his sexuality?
00:42:29.255,00:42:32.383,Was there a point at which someone could have... intervened?
00:42:32.466,00:42:34.385,"Well, you're asking the right questions."
00:42:34.885,00:42:36.178,I want the right answers.
00:42:36.262,00:42:37.304,Don't we all.
00:42:39.640,00:42:41.642,-I'm glad you're here. -Well...
00:42:56.991,00:42:59.994,"Hey, Bill. I've been thinking about another angle with Brudos."
00:43:00.077,00:43:02.663,Remember what Wendy said about deflecting responsibility?
00:43:02.746,00:43:03.747,Save it.
00:43:13.591,00:43:17.303,May I speak with Detective McGraw? This is Bill Tench with the FBI.
00:43:17.386,00:43:19.513,-He's out right now. Can I take a message? -Yes.
00:43:19.597,00:43:22.433,Ask him to look at the photos from the Ada Jeffries case.
00:43:24.101,00:43:26.729,Tell him to look at the knots that were used to tie her up.
00:43:26.812,00:43:29.982,They're nautical and Fairfield is landlocked.
00:43:30.524,00:43:32.276,"-Okay, I'll let him know. -Thank you."
00:43:35.779,00:43:38.532,"-Are you sure there's still something-- -Holden, leave me alone."
00:43:40.409,00:43:42.786,Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bed.
00:43:48.208,00:43:53.213,"What I was saying yesterday about remaining objective, you were right, it's bullshit."
00:43:53.797,00:43:54.965,It's very hard.
00:43:55.591,00:43:56.925,I've been around crazy.
00:43:57.009,00:43:58.510,I was in the army.
00:43:58.594,00:44:00.262,Road School was a cakewalk.
00:44:00.346,00:44:05.100,I didn't mind talking about this stuff. But what the fuck did I even know?
00:44:15.569,00:44:17.738,"-I'm talking to you. -No, a professional."
00:44:17.821,00:44:19.406,You are professional.
00:44:19.490,00:44:21.241,I'm your coworker. I can't be your therapist.
00:44:25.371,00:44:27.915,Times have changed. You don't have to be the good soldier.
00:44:30.876,00:44:32.419,He's fucking immune.
00:44:33.921,00:44:35.422,How do I tap into that?
00:45:05.285,00:45:08.038,"-Hello, there. -Oh, my God. You look fantastic."
00:45:14.878,00:45:16.672,Mm... I made dinner.
00:45:24.012,00:45:25.431,"Well, don't sound so surprised."
00:45:25.514,00:45:28.642,-You've been holding out on me. -Isn't that what nice girls do?
00:45:28.725,00:45:30.352,It worked. Marry me.
00:45:30.436,00:45:32.104,So I can cook for you? No.
00:45:34.481,00:45:36.066,To your culinary skills.
00:45:41.238,00:45:42.406,To changing my life.
00:45:42.489,00:45:43.907,To opening my mind.
00:45:45.576,00:45:47.578,Inspiring me to go back to school.
00:45:47.661,00:45:48.996,Wasn't this toast about me?
00:45:52.166,00:45:54.084,I want you to know that I see you.
00:45:54.668,00:45:56.795,"How dedicated you are, how disciplined."
00:45:58.714,00:45:59.590,Hey.
00:46:00.215,00:46:03.469,You have the courage to follow your curiosity.
00:46:03.552,00:46:05.053,"Okay, enough."
00:46:05.137,00:46:08.098,"-And you put up with my tendency to go on. -That, I do."
00:46:12.561,00:46:14.771,I am truly delighted to be in your life.
00:46:25.657,00:46:26.617,Come on.
00:46:31.038,00:46:31.955,Come on.
00:46:45.761,00:46:47.095,Hold that thought.
00:48:29.281,00:48:30.324,What's wrong?
00:48:31.908,00:48:32.993,You don't like it?
00:48:36.622,00:48:37.831,"No, I love it."
00:49:26.838,00:49:27.923,Are you okay?
00:49:33.053,00:49:34.096,It's weird.
00:49:37.974,00:49:39.017,This?
00:49:40.310,00:49:42.187,It's just... not you.
00:49:46.692,00:49:49.027,"Yeah, Holden. That's the point."
00:02:02.372,00:02:03.665,Pyromania.
00:02:04.374,00:02:05.375,Torture.
00:02:06.251,00:02:07.127,Mutilation.
00:02:10.088,00:02:12.549,"Using Career Week to discuss early intervention, it's a great idea."
00:02:12.632,00:02:15.260,I had been thinking about how we educate kids when you called.
00:02:15.343,00:02:18.847,"And coming from the FBI, it is a powerful statement."
00:02:19.556,00:02:22.851,But how do I get it across if I can't use these words?
00:02:28.398,00:02:29.482,Mutilation.
00:02:30.108,00:02:37.031,"If you use that, I guarantee you that at least one of them, Jenny Cromer, Michael Stahl, these are confident, curious children."
00:02:37.115,00:02:39.576,They will ask you what mutilation means.
00:02:39.659,00:02:42.412,"-And I can describe it, and specifically-- -And then..."
00:02:43.121,00:02:52.714,"a few of them will go home, they'll have nightmares, and tomorrow I'll be fielding calls from parents who will be concerned-- -Parents should be discussing this, too. -Absolutely."
00:03:02.265,00:03:03.558,Could I say hurting?
00:03:04.434,00:03:05.393,Hurting animals?
00:03:05.476,00:03:07.854,What about being mean to animals?
00:03:10.982,00:03:12.817,You really think that pyromania is too much?
00:03:12.901,00:03:15.445,-My students will not know what that is. -Arson?
00:03:15.528,00:03:16.821,Mm-mm.
00:03:16.905,00:03:20.241,-Deviant? -They will not know what that is.
00:03:20.325,00:03:22.493,Even if I used it in context?
00:03:22.577,00:03:23.620,It's harsh.
00:03:23.703,00:03:25.872,"We need to prepare them for the world, yes."
00:03:26.414,00:03:29.334,But we also need to protect them from it.
00:03:33.087,00:03:34.213,disturbing.
00:03:36.424,00:03:37.800,"Listen, Agent Ford."
00:03:38.801,00:03:40.220,Show them your badge.
00:03:46.142,00:03:50.480,My job at the FBI is to study people who exhibit disturbing behavior.
00:03:51.022,00:03:56.569,"If I can classify this behavior, I can help the police catch these people when they commit a crime."
00:03:57.528,00:04:04.244,But lately I've been asking myself: can we stop these people from becoming disturbing in the first place?
00:04:05.828,00:04:07.372,That's where you come in.
00:04:07.997,00:04:10.333,"By your age, we can start seeing the signs."
00:04:10.416,00:04:16.422,"In this whole classroom, statistically speaking, disturbing behavior would show up in about one of you."
00:04:16.923,00:04:20.260,Say you have a friend who likes lighting fires.
00:04:20.343,00:04:24.597,"I mean, deliberately setting things on fire, like toys or trash."
00:04:25.640,00:04:29.727,"Another sign that your friend is disturbed, is if he shows a lack of remorse."
00:04:31.938,00:04:36.025,"That is, if he's done something wrong, he doesn't feel bad about it."
00:04:37.318,00:04:40.196,-Yes. -Are only boys disturbed?
00:04:40.280,00:04:46.119,"Perhaps I should be saying he or she, but yes, actually, it is mostly males who are disturbed."
00:04:49.414,00:04:53.668,Another thing you should be aware of at your age is the way we treat animals.
00:04:53.751,00:04:56.087,"Now animals are nice to us, so we should be nice back."
00:04:56.170,00:05:01.551,But say you have a friend who is being mean to an animal.
00:05:01.634,00:05:04.220,Very mean. You should take note of that.
00:05:04.971,00:05:05.805,Yes.
00:05:05.888,00:05:07.932,My brother throws rocks at our dog.
00:05:08.016,00:05:14.355,"Well, that doesn't sound very nice, but let me ask you: are they big rocks or little rocks?"
00:05:14.439,00:05:18.151,-Mm... medium rocks. -Okay.
00:05:18.234,00:05:21.738,"The kind of behavior towards animals that I'm talking about is, um..."
00:05:22.780,00:05:24.157,forcible...
00:05:28.786,00:05:35.543,"It's about hurting the animal, and you'll know when that's happening because an animal will let you know when it is being hurt."
00:05:38.713,00:05:43.092,"In any case, if you see this, you should tell a teacher, or your mom, or your dad."
00:05:43.176,00:05:55.063,"The idea is that you stop your friend, who is a disturbing kid, from becoming a disturbing adult, because one day he may start being mean to people."
00:05:56.856,00:05:57.774,So...
00:06:02.070,00:06:03.654,Who wants to see my badge?
00:06:07.742,00:06:11.996,It means so much to these students that someone like yourself would take an interest.
00:06:12.080,00:06:14.832,"Sure, that was great. They're very smart."
00:06:15.374,00:06:17.794,Top standardized test scores in the district.
00:06:18.503,00:06:20.922,"Well, if you want to do any more outreach, just let me know."
00:06:21.005,00:06:23.883,"Don't say that, I'll hold you to it. Thanks again."
00:06:23.966,00:06:24.884,Thank you.
00:06:27.970,00:06:29.055,Mr. Ford?
00:06:29.555,00:06:30.431,Holden.
00:06:32.683,00:06:35.019,-May I have a moment? -Sure.
00:06:35.103,00:06:41.109,"I know you weren't here today to talk to us, but I've heard about some behavior that I'd classify as disturbing."
00:06:41.692,00:06:42.610,Okay.
00:06:42.693,00:06:46.489,"Well, odd at the very least, but I believe my instincts are good."
00:06:46.989,00:06:48.699,It all starts with instinct.
00:06:48.783,00:06:50.284,And I'm not the only one.
00:06:50.368,00:06:54.747,"Some of the other teachers are concerned, several parents, certain members of the school board."
00:06:54.831,00:06:56.415,We even took it to the local police.
00:06:57.291,00:06:58.209,What is it?
00:06:59.919,00:07:02.130,Let's go to the staff room. This way.
00:07:09.846,00:07:12.723,-He has a thing for tickling. -Who does?
00:07:12.807,00:07:15.685,"Principal Wade, Roger, tickles the children."
00:07:16.727,00:07:18.438,-Where? -In his office.
00:07:19.272,00:07:20.773,"I mean, where on the body?"
00:07:20.857,00:07:22.024,Their feet.
00:07:22.108,00:07:26.154,"Sometimes a child will go to his office for disciplinary reasons, that's when it happens."
00:07:26.237,00:07:27.572,Is it punishment?
00:07:27.655,00:07:31.284,"I think it's supposed to mitigate the punishment, but then he gives them money."
00:07:31.909,00:07:33.369,-For what? -Nickels.
00:07:33.453,00:07:36.372,He gives them nickels if they can withstand the tickling.
00:07:36.914,00:07:38.291,"Okay, well..."
00:07:39.083,00:07:40.334,that is odd.
00:07:40.960,00:07:44.297,-It's completely inappropriate. -Has anybody talked with him?
00:07:44.630,00:07:47.341,"The board questioned him, nothing happened."
00:07:47.425,00:07:49.177,But somebody took it to the police?
00:07:49.260,00:07:51.721,"I did, at the urging of some parents."
00:07:51.804,00:07:54.932,-Parents asked you to go to the police? -I talked to a Detective Barr.
00:07:55.016,00:07:57.602,"He said they'd look into it, write something up."
00:07:57.727,00:07:58.769,That was five months ago.
00:07:58.853,00:08:01.731,"-Have you seen a report? -No, it's like the whole thing went away."
00:08:01.814,00:08:03.399,Maybe you could check in with him.
00:08:05.026,00:08:06.486,This isn't exactly my area.
00:08:09.489,00:08:14.494,"At least by our definition at the Behavioral Science Unit, tickling is not considered deviant behavior."
00:08:14.577,00:08:16.370,Deviant? You said disturbing.
00:08:17.455,00:08:20.082,Whatever's going on here is obviously nuanced.
00:08:20.583,00:08:23.252,I'd have to witness it or at least get his version.
00:08:24.045,00:08:26.506,-Do you have children? -Not yet.
00:08:27.215,00:08:29.550,Imagine one of those seven-year-olds is yours.
00:08:30.009,00:08:34.222,Principal Wade has her take off her shoes and socks so that he can tickle her feet.
00:08:38.809,00:08:40.186,"Put a call in, please?"
00:09:11.467,00:09:13.636,Where were you? I was worried.
00:09:13.719,00:09:17.098,"Sorry, my car's in the shop. I had to wait for Patrick to give me a ride."
00:09:17.557,00:09:20.935,"-Patrick? -Yeah, you know, from my psych class."
00:09:32.113,00:09:34.198,-Put ice in it. -Gross.
00:09:34.282,00:09:36.200,"Here, I'll stick it in the freezer."
00:09:36.576,00:09:38.369,Remember the last time you did that?
00:09:41.789,00:09:42.915,I would've picked you up.
00:09:43.499,00:09:46.502,"At school? No, it's way too far out of your way."
00:09:47.920,00:09:49.380,So what happened to your car?
00:09:50.006,00:09:52.550,Uh... maintenance.
00:09:52.633,00:09:55.261,"You, Debbie Mitford, took your car in for maintenance?"
00:09:55.845,00:09:58.556,I've kind of been forgetting to put oil in it.
00:09:59.473,00:10:00.474,You seized your engine?
00:10:01.225,00:10:02.351,Something like that.
00:10:03.227,00:10:06.063,"The guys at the shop gave me enough grief, so you don't have to."
00:10:06.147,00:10:07.940,I don't think I can not give you grief.
00:10:08.024,00:10:10.318,My dad used to remind me to change my oil.
00:10:10.401,00:10:11.611,Maybe you could do the same.
00:10:11.694,00:10:13.070,Maybe get Patrick to remind you.
00:10:13.487,00:10:15.281,You are so stupid.
00:10:15.364,00:10:16.907,-Am I? -Yes.
00:10:18.576,00:10:20.578,Why is it so hard to stay mad at you?
00:10:20.661,00:10:21.871,I don't know.
00:10:29.170,00:10:31.213,I would not want any principal touching my kid's feet.
00:10:31.964,00:10:35.301,He seems like a good guy. And he's been great for that school.
00:10:35.384,00:10:36.969,Did the superintendent talk to him?
00:10:41.140,00:10:46.854,My cousin had this first grade teacher who would give her a sticker if she'd let him pinch her cheek. He did it to all the girls.
00:10:46.937,00:10:50.191,It only came out years later that he was pinching some of them in other places.
00:10:50.274,00:10:52.401,-Was he ever caught? -No.
00:10:52.485,00:10:56.155,She didn't find out until her classmates started comparing notes at a high school reunion.
00:10:56.906,00:10:59.200,Kids won't talk about that stuff when they're little.
00:10:59.283,00:11:01.994,"They assume the adult is right, especially if he's an authority figure."
00:11:02.078,00:11:03.996,I wonder how many girls he did that to.
00:11:04.080,00:11:06.916,"Well, he was a teacher for 40 years."
00:11:08.793,00:11:11.295,"There were whispers, but by that point he was retired."
00:11:13.839,00:11:15.800,just like with Brudos and Roger.
00:11:20.179,00:11:24.683,Almost like they can't help themselves. They've got this... compulsion.
00:11:24.767,00:11:27.311,You think Roger is in any way similar to Brudos?
00:11:28.396,00:11:30.147,Both of them sure like these.
00:11:30.231,00:11:32.191,"Looks like somebody else does, too."
00:11:42.243,00:11:43.452,Listen...
00:11:50.501,00:11:51.335,Okay.
00:12:10.563,00:12:13.774,Staff politics. Women like that are always looking for a pot to stir.
00:12:13.858,00:12:15.734,She seemed genuinely concerned.
00:12:15.818,00:12:19.989,"-She wasn't married, as I remember. -What does that have to do with it?"
00:12:20.072,00:12:21.240,She's got extra energy.
00:12:21.866,00:12:23.659,"Apparently, some parents are concerned, too."
00:12:23.742,00:12:27.371,"-She said that, but I never saw them. -Did you follow up at all?"
00:12:27.455,00:12:30.166,There's no victim. No one's pressing charges.
00:12:31.709,00:12:33.252,Giving them money for it.
00:12:33.335,00:12:36.297,"He's tickling kids, that's not a crime."
00:12:36.839,00:12:39.175,I can't arrest him unless he does something illegal.
00:12:39.258,00:12:42.970,"I explained this to Ms. Ebner, I shouldn't have to explain it to the FBI."
00:12:43.512,00:12:46.015,Unless you're gonna start predicting what people do.
00:12:47.892,00:12:49.351,May I see the report?
00:12:51.687,00:12:54.398,-Why am I reading this? -I thought we might look into it.
00:12:54.482,00:12:55.441,A foot tickler?
00:12:55.524,00:12:58.402,It could be a form of podophilia... like Brudos.
00:12:58.486,00:13:00.613,This guy's a grade school principal with no record.
00:13:00.696,00:13:02.990,People are concerned. No one will help them.
00:13:03.073,00:13:04.700,-Just one teacher. -No.
00:13:05.409,00:13:06.494,I talked to the superintendent.
00:13:06.577,00:13:08.913,Some members of the school board have been complaining.
00:13:11.957,00:13:13.584,I don't see your stack getting shorter.
00:13:13.667,00:13:16.754,"-I looked at them, all nos. -No as in, don't even interview?"
00:13:16.837,00:13:19.215,-They're greenhorns. -So were you.
00:13:19.298,00:13:21.717,We mainly need someone to take over transcribing.
00:13:21.800,00:13:23.677,They're all gunning to talk to lust murderers.
00:13:23.761,00:13:25.471,They bring nothing to the table.
00:13:26.180,00:13:27.014,Tell Wendy.
00:13:28.390,00:13:29.517,Okay.
00:13:34.980,00:13:36.023,How's this?
00:13:42.613,00:13:44.448,Want me to take us to the airport tomorrow?
00:13:44.532,00:13:47.660,I decided last night. I'm not going.
00:13:47.743,00:13:49.995,-What? -I'm not going back to Oregon.
00:13:52.248,00:13:53.290,If you want.
00:13:53.374,00:13:55.793,But we were just getting him to open up.
00:13:55.876,00:13:57.127,That's why I'm not going.
00:13:57.211,00:13:59.004,When did you get so fragile?
00:14:01.006,00:14:03.676,Bill... I do not want to do this alone.
00:14:03.759,00:14:06.428,So don't. We have a ton of material from last time.
00:14:06.512,00:14:07.638,Not nearly enough.
00:14:07.721,00:14:10.599,-I just came up with a whole new strategy. -Go for it.
00:14:11.850,00:14:13.394,You're really not coming.
00:14:14.228,00:14:15.437,I'm really not coming.
00:14:16.438,00:14:20.442,"Okay. Then I'll just show him that one of us isn't a big, fat, fucking pussy."
00:14:21.193,00:14:23.529,Yeah. Show him that.
00:14:53.225,00:14:54.059,Hi.
00:14:56.228,00:14:58.314,-Something wrong? -I can't close my recorder.
00:14:58.397,00:14:59.523,Give it to me.
00:15:00.441,00:15:01.483,Thank you.
00:15:04.904,00:15:12.202,I'm one of the only... inmates they allow in hobby shop.
00:15:12.286,00:15:13.329,Really?
00:15:13.412,00:15:16.749,Yeah. I can use scissors under supervision.
00:15:19.627,00:15:21.962,The parole board should really take that into account.
00:15:22.046,00:15:24.298,-And we're live. -Okay.
00:15:24.381,00:15:26.050,"So, uh, today..."
00:15:26.800,00:15:29.178,-I'd like to pick up with things-- -Where's Bill?
00:15:30.721,00:15:33.057,-He couldn't be here this time. -Did I scare him off?
00:15:33.140,00:15:34.183,No. Uh...
00:15:34.266,00:15:36.352,We're doing some hiring back at the office.
00:15:36.435,00:15:37.853,Fresh meat for the mill?
00:15:43.901,00:15:45.152,"Bill, I miss you."
00:15:45.611,00:15:47.029,Please come back.
00:15:53.786,00:15:54.620,Okay.
00:15:54.703,00:15:57.122,"Her car broke down on the highway, you pulled over."
00:15:57.206,00:15:59.458,"-Yeah, helped her out. -How did you help her?"
00:15:59.959,00:16:02.211,"Said, Let's go home, we'll call a mechanic."
00:16:02.795,00:16:04.380,-Home to your house? -Yeah.
00:16:04.463,00:16:07.633,-Did you call the mechanic? -Didn't get that far.
00:16:08.258,00:16:09.093,Why not?
00:16:09.176,00:16:11.178,She was interested in my photography.
00:16:12.596,00:16:14.848,-Did she also want to be a model? -Yeah.
00:16:15.391,00:16:17.643,Funny how all these girls you met wanted that.
00:16:17.726,00:16:19.812,Women like men to pay attention to 'em.
00:16:20.479,00:16:21.730,"So, did you..."
00:16:22.690,00:16:25.234,-Invited her to the garage. -Mm-hmm.
00:16:25.317,00:16:27.152,-Took some photos-- -What kind of photos?
00:16:27.236,00:16:28.654,"You know, headshots."
00:16:29.947,00:16:31.824,Right. And after these headshots...
00:16:31.907,00:16:33.742,She decided to walk home.
00:16:34.702,00:16:36.453,And that's the last you saw of her.
00:16:36.537,00:16:38.580,"Last anyone saw of her, as far as I remember."
00:16:39.373,00:16:44.169,Her body was found in the Willamette River tied to an auto transmission to weigh it down.
00:16:44.878,00:16:47.131,The transmission was traced back to a car that you owned.
00:16:47.214,00:16:48.340,"Yeah, I know."
00:16:50.467,00:16:51.510,You have any smokes?
00:16:52.594,00:16:53.595,Yeah.
00:16:56.974,00:16:58.017,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:58.517,00:17:01.937,"The transmission, the photos, the foot... all of it."
00:17:04.481,00:17:05.566,Well...
00:17:06.900,00:17:08.777,someone killed those girls.
00:17:09.653,00:17:11.989,"Yeah, I know. I have a whole theory about that."
00:17:12.573,00:17:13.574,Really?
00:17:14.116,00:17:15.075,Let's hear it.
00:17:15.159,00:17:19.288,Well... these girls are disappearing.
00:17:19.371,00:17:21.790,Body parts showing up in the river. Police get involved.
00:17:25.335,00:17:30.215,"Probably chopping up girls in Seattle, Idaho, Canada, as we speak."
00:17:30.299,00:17:32.259,"Meanwhile, they need to blame someone."
00:17:32.676,00:17:34.595,They catch me sniffing around some coeds.
00:17:34.678,00:17:36.346,I'm not saying I'm an angel.
00:17:36.472,00:17:41.018,"Search my house, find a few pairs of shoes, decide I'm their fall guy."
00:17:42.019,00:17:45.272,"Everyone feels safe, DA gets re-elected, yada yada yada."
00:17:50.819,00:17:52.029,Huge coincidence.
00:17:54.198,00:17:57.284,Do you think that he... planned his attacks?
00:18:00.412,00:18:07.961,"Maybe the first one fell into his lap, but then maybe after that, he got a taste for it."
00:18:08.045,00:18:10.631,Oh. Now that's interesting.
00:18:10.714,00:18:13.509,"Because there were no photos of the first girl, right?"
00:18:15.302,00:18:18.138,"But the other three, it was like he was prepared."
00:18:20.015,00:18:26.730,"Do you think that even before the first one, he fantasized about murdering a woman?"
00:18:26.814,00:18:27.940,Definitely.
00:18:29.608,00:18:31.360,What do you think he fantasized about?
00:18:33.028,00:18:35.739,"Choking them, chopping them up, all that stuff they said I did."
00:18:36.657,00:18:42.037,"So the murders were just an extension of thoughts he already had, maybe for a long time."
00:18:42.121,00:18:44.623,You'd have to think about it pretty hard to go through with it.
00:18:47.751,00:18:49.294,"You mean like, out of control?"
00:18:49.878,00:18:53.882,"Maybe his real life was out of control, but his fantasy life was..."
00:18:53.966,00:18:57.469,A... place where he could feel powerful.
00:18:57.553,00:19:02.391,-Makes sense. -But then why-- For example...
00:19:03.809,00:19:05.894,Laura Sullivan was hit from behind.
00:19:05.978,00:19:08.564,Jane Weber was choked from behind.
00:19:09.523,00:19:11.150,Why would he do it that way?
00:19:13.193,00:19:14.945,Didn't want them looking at him?
00:19:16.113,00:19:17.114,Why not?
00:19:18.031,00:19:21.451,It might not have been about watching them die.
00:19:21.535,00:19:24.580,"You know, because then he would have tortured them, right?"
00:19:24.955,00:19:28.584,It might just been about having them quiet.
00:19:30.377,00:19:33.130,So that he could play with them?
00:19:33.213,00:19:36.341,Like you'd play with a doll?
00:19:36.842,00:19:40.512,"Yeah, there were all these photos of 'em in different positions."
00:19:40.596,00:19:42.264,-Have intercourse with them? -Sure.
00:19:42.347,00:19:45.058,"But then he played with some of them before they died, as well."
00:19:45.142,00:19:49.396,Kathy Schmidt was photographed in a piece of lingerie that was not hers.
00:19:49.479,00:19:51.190,"Oh, she probably liked that."
00:19:51.732,00:19:54.193,"Well, she was kidnapped from a parking garage."
00:19:54.276,00:19:56.069,How do you know she was kidnapped?
00:19:56.403,00:19:58.071,You think she went willingly?
00:19:59.406,00:20:01.617,"All I'm saying is, all the women I meet..."
00:20:02.201,00:20:03.327,Want to be models.
00:20:04.620,00:20:11.376,"So do you think that with Kathy Schmidt it was consensual, she didn't realize that she was going to be killed?"
00:20:12.419,00:20:14.463,"She may have been getting the feeling, you know."
00:20:14.546,00:20:21.511,"I mean, he may have made it clear at a certain point that she needed to take the pictures if she wanted him to let her go."
00:20:26.225,00:20:27.976,"Do you think the killer enjoyed that, too?"
00:20:28.977,00:20:31.188,He might've thought that's what you get.
00:20:31.647,00:20:34.816,That's what you get when you want to be a model?
00:20:35.734,00:20:37.861,When you want people to look at you.
00:20:49.206,00:20:50.374,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:50.457,00:20:52.167,Probably made him want more.
00:20:53.543,00:20:55.671,"After he got a taste for it, like you said."
00:20:55.754,00:20:57.339,After he got a taste.
00:20:59.132,00:21:02.302,"I guess... we all have fantasies, don't we?"
00:21:03.136,00:21:05.597,I can remember my first fantasy of girls.
00:21:07.140,00:21:08.100,"What, um..."
00:21:10.310,00:21:11.853,What was your first fantasy?
00:21:15.023,00:21:17.359,Must have been... nine or ten.
00:21:19.403,00:21:22.281,There was a woman in a tunnel. I'd trapped her there.
00:21:24.074,00:21:27.369,She was like this white shape in the darkness.
00:21:28.120,00:21:29.705,I made her do things.
00:21:33.333,00:21:35.002,I just remember her...
00:21:36.003,00:21:40.173,begging for... mercy.
00:21:43.176,00:21:45.053,"Do you still have fantasies, Jerry?"
00:21:48.807,00:21:50.309,No. I don't.
00:21:51.685,00:21:53.478,Tell the parole board that.
00:21:58.525,00:22:00.527,"Day three, he takes the stand."
00:22:00.610,00:22:06.616,"Now we knew he was lying, but it could've gone either way because he had two other Klansmen to back him up."
00:22:09.161,00:22:11.204,I slide right behind his girlfriend.
00:22:11.288,00:22:15.417,"I drape my arm across the back of her bench, I lean in real close, so, uh..."
00:22:19.171,00:22:20.672,The guy's eyes bug out.
00:22:20.756,00:22:29.681,"He starts stammering, he comes completely unglued, Great stories, Jim."
00:22:30.307,00:22:31.933,So nice to meet you.
00:22:32.017,00:22:33.894,Thanks for coming all the way up from Atlanta.
00:22:33.977,00:22:35.854,Word is out y'all are onto something big.
00:22:38.982,00:22:40.567,"Oh, you surpassed it."
00:22:42.110,00:22:45.072,"We have to meet a few more people, but we can let you know soon."
00:22:45.155,00:22:47.949,"I'll say it one more time, I'd love to join the team."
00:22:48.033,00:22:50.202,-We'd love to have you. -Thank you.
00:22:59.461,00:23:00.629,He's black.
00:23:00.712,00:23:02.005,Nothing gets past you.
00:23:02.631,00:23:05.133,He's our best candidate. I think we should hire him.
00:23:05.217,00:23:09.429,"Our list of potential subjects are 80, 90 percent white and probably racist."
00:23:09.513,00:23:10.764,Does that mean no?
00:23:10.847,00:23:13.391,He could incite a response that affects the study.
00:23:13.475,00:23:14.559,That means no.
00:23:15.352,00:23:18.355,Don't put that on his assessment. We can't be seen as racists.
00:23:18.438,00:23:20.315,I thought our newbies would be transcribing.
00:23:20.398,00:23:21.233,Did Brudos behave?
00:23:22.484,00:23:23.735,He was almost pleasant.
00:23:24.277,00:23:26.446,Seems repeat visits are important.
00:23:27.364,00:23:29.950,Did you confide in him about your cum sock?
00:23:30.826,00:23:38.333,"Our new team member will train with transcription, but we're looking for someone that has operations experience so that we can expand our subjects' interviews."
00:23:38.416,00:23:40.961,-Especially if Bill keeps wussing out. -Stop whining.
00:23:41.628,00:23:42.754,How many have you seen?
00:23:42.838,00:23:45.757,"Oh, I didn't think you were interested in the process."
00:23:53.014,00:23:55.934,"Gregg's done a lot of work in the field, he's a talented agent."
00:23:56.017,00:23:58.854,His dad and I studied pre-law together at Dartmouth.
00:24:09.489,00:24:17.247,"It's dark and all I see is his knuckles gripping the stock, and he's yelling, Halt! Police! Drop the gun!"
00:24:17.747,00:24:20.834,-I realize this guy is about to shoot me. -Whoa.
00:24:25.505,00:24:26.673,He saved my life.
00:24:27.507,00:24:29.759,"Because I was frozen, I couldn't speak."
00:24:29.843,00:24:32.929,"Uniform lowers his shotgun, and we take off again after the driver."
00:24:33.013,00:24:39.269,Mike catches him and nearly beats the flimflam out of him because he's so keyed up after watching me almost get blown away.
00:24:39.352,00:24:42.564,I had to pull him off the guy. But anyway...
00:24:43.732,00:24:44.691,a great partner.
00:24:44.774,00:24:48.195,"Well, you did your partner a good deed. I bet he's grateful."
00:24:52.365,00:24:53.700,You Catholic?
00:24:54.701,00:24:56.661,"My mother's Catholic, my father's Quaker."
00:24:59.206,00:25:01.875,Our family joke was that we'd never run out of guilt or oats.
00:25:06.338,00:25:07.172,Doctor. Yes.
00:25:07.839,00:25:11.384,I have to admit that as a kid I leaned toward the drama of the Church.
00:25:11.468,00:25:15.972,"The organ, the incense, Jesus rising from the dead Easter morning."
00:25:16.056,00:25:18.266,Do you believe that Jesus rose from the dead?
00:25:18.350,00:25:20.977,I am Christian. So is my wife.
00:25:21.561,00:25:23.688,She's Catholic. We've already got two little girls.
00:25:23.772,00:25:25.857,We're trying to slow-play the whole big family thing.
00:25:25.941,00:25:27.359,"Good and evil, right and wrong?"
00:25:27.442,00:25:30.445,"-Are these concepts that you believe in? -Yes, I do."
00:25:30.528,00:25:35.367,Binary thinking could hamstring you when it comes to critical assessment of our subjects.
00:25:35.450,00:25:37.452,We need to understand the gray areas.
00:25:37.535,00:25:41.539,"The world is complex, I get that. I can check my judgment at the door."
00:25:41.623,00:25:44.960,The people we work with have done things you don't even want to imagine.
00:25:48.046,00:25:55.345,It's another to sit three feet away from a guy who's delighted to tell you how hard it was to stick his dick in his mother's neck after he sawed off her head.
00:25:57.597,00:25:59.516,What made you apply for the study?
00:26:00.934,00:26:01.768,My daughters.
00:26:03.061,00:26:05.188,When I hear about girls disappearing...
00:26:06.106,00:26:09.401,"This may sound corny, but I want to make the world a safer place for them."
00:26:10.068,00:26:13.405,He's smart. He's a family guy. He knows what's at stake.
00:26:13.488,00:26:16.741,Ugh! He's got you wrapped around his little Ivy League finger.
00:26:16.825,00:26:18.868,-You think it's an act? -He's a mole for Shepard.
00:26:20.245,00:26:22.372,When's the last time Shepard came down here?
00:26:22.455,00:26:25.667,He's trying to make sure we're not smearing the good name of the FBI.
00:26:25.750,00:26:27.585,Don't kid yourself. We need Shepard.
00:26:27.669,00:26:31.131,His heart's in the right place. I think Agent Smith is earnest.
00:26:31.214,00:26:34.426,-And that's a good thing? -What about a trial period?
00:26:34.509,00:26:36.761,To see if we can beat the flimflam out of him?
00:27:48.708,00:27:49.834,What's going on?
00:27:50.960,00:27:52.170,Just seeing what he can take.
00:27:57.467,00:28:01.513,-Are you trying to get rid of this guy? -So listen. This thing with Roger Wade...
00:28:01.596,00:28:04.140,-Who? -The principal at Shady Lane Elementary.
00:28:04.849,00:28:05.683,The foot tickler?
00:28:05.767,00:28:08.144,"After I talked to the superintendent, the school board had a meeting."
00:28:08.228,00:28:10.980,-You've got to be kidding. -They're begging us to look into it.
00:28:11.064,00:28:13.358,-They're begging? -They're... asking.
00:28:13.441,00:28:16.403,"Our LEAA review is coming up, what are you still doing on this goose chase?"
00:28:16.486,00:28:19.614,Gregg can finish the paperwork. Let's give this a day.
00:28:19.697,00:28:22.450,-There are meaningful signs here. -You're not dragging me into this.
00:28:22.534,00:28:24.702,What's the point if we don't apply it to the real world?
00:28:24.786,00:28:31.209,"We're trying to save women from getting pulled into vans and cut to pieces, not crucify some schoolmarm who hasn't done anything."
00:28:31.292,00:28:34.462,Yet. Certainly our goal is to be preemptive.
00:28:35.255,00:28:37.882,"We're the FBI, Holden. That is not our goal."
00:28:38.675,00:28:39.634,Yet.
00:28:54.607,00:28:56.025,still want this job?
00:28:57.068,00:29:00.196,The students certainly don't complain. They enjoy the contact.
00:29:00.280,00:29:06.661,"Yes, but as you said to me when I was here before, it might be best for parents to determine-- We are a community."
00:29:06.745,00:29:08.997,And I want the children to know that.
00:29:09.080,00:29:13.334,"In the five years that I've been here, their test scores have gone up almost 30 percent."
00:29:13.418,00:29:18.131,"And it's not because I'm a strict disciplinarian, or I pile on the homework, or I cut recess."
00:29:22.927,00:29:25.638,-These children matter to me. -That is quite clear.
00:29:25.722,00:29:31.853,"We have special games, sports, art projects, teamwork activities."
00:29:31.936,00:29:34.731,I am teaching happiness.
00:29:38.485,00:29:40.403,"All right, let me give you an example."
00:29:41.154,00:29:47.535,"We had this child, six years old, who said he sprained his ankle playing kickball and didn't want to go to class."
00:29:47.619,00:29:52.707,"The nurse calls me down because his ankle is not swollen, but he's still claiming that it hurts."
00:29:52.791,00:29:55.919,Now... I don't want to call him a liar.
00:29:56.836,00:29:59.464,"So, I wiggle his big toe."
00:30:00.173,00:30:02.383,Does it hurt when this little piggy goes to market?
00:30:03.301,00:30:07.055,How about when this little piggy stays home? He smiles.
00:30:07.138,00:30:09.599,He says that it tickles. So I tickle his feet.
00:30:09.682,00:30:12.268,"The next thing I know, he's laughing."
00:30:12.352,00:30:15.313,"He's happy, he goes back to class."
00:30:15.396,00:30:18.107,-Did you also give him a nickel? -I'm sure I did.
00:30:24.280,00:30:25.365,Exactly.
00:30:26.533,00:30:29.410,"Agent Ford, you're blowing this out of proportion."
00:30:36.042,00:30:38.628,Did you think that piggy goes to market stuff was weird?
00:30:38.711,00:30:41.005,"Oh, my kids love Piggy Goes to the Market."
00:30:45.844,00:30:47.804,"Maybe that's all it is, but..."
00:30:49.013,00:30:53.518,"if there is a sexual angle, Roger would no doubt be good at hiding it."
00:30:54.435,00:30:59.941,"When Kemper went in for his last psychiatric evaluation, he had a 15-year-old girl's head in the trunk of his car."
00:31:00.817,00:31:07.156,"It gave him a thrill to persuade the committee successfully that he was over his psychological problems, knowing that he had a trophy outside."
00:31:08.241,00:31:09.617,Isn't that kind of extreme?
00:31:15.582,00:31:19.085,I'm glad Janet finally did something. Someone had to.
00:31:19.168,00:31:21.254,So you don't approve of Roger's behavior?
00:31:21.337,00:31:28.928,"I've always thought that tickling was bizarre enough, but I get parents coming to me, asking why their children suddenly have pocket change."
00:31:29.012,00:31:30.680,How long has this gone on for?
00:31:30.763,00:31:32.640,I've only been at Shady Lane two years.
00:31:32.724,00:31:34.809,It sounds like it goes back further than that.
00:31:34.893,00:31:37.270,Why are parents complaining to you? Why not go to Roger?
00:31:37.353,00:31:41.399,"He brushes them off, he's unapologetic, and he's a big deal around here."
00:31:46.404,00:31:48.698,-You think he'd retaliate? -I don't know.
00:31:48.781,00:31:51.492,"It's a small school, everyone seems to know about the tickling."
00:31:51.576,00:31:53.870,How do the children respond to his tickling?
00:31:53.953,00:31:55.204,They endure it.
00:31:55.288,00:31:57.248,They know they're going to get paid.
00:31:57.582,00:32:01.127,"I have students coming back from his office, showing off their earnings."
00:32:01.210,00:32:05.173,"What did you think of Roger when you first came here, before you knew about this?"
00:32:06.174,00:32:07.675,I thought he was smug.
00:32:08.384,00:32:13.473,"I transferred because I heard how great this place is, but then that's all he talks about."
00:32:13.556,00:32:15.433,He really toots his own horn.
00:32:15.892,00:32:18.144,The teachers are supposed to be cheerleaders.
00:32:18.353,00:32:21.397,And I've always been uncomfortable with how he handles the children.
00:32:21.481,00:32:24.192,-What do you mean? -He's always fussing over them.
00:32:29.280,00:32:33.451,"Mrs. Clark, could you make a list of parents and teachers that feel the same way?"
00:32:34.202,00:32:38.206,"We're meeting with a handful, but we'd like to get a sense of the whole picture."
00:32:40.041,00:32:41.209,Is something wrong?
00:32:41.292,00:32:44.379,I don't want a witch hunt. I'm not vindictive.
00:32:48.466,00:32:51.886,"When he visits the class, I know it's going to be an easier day."
00:32:51.970,00:32:55.306,He can turn a moody room into an eager one just by walking in.
00:32:55.390,00:32:57.016,You've heard about the tickling?
00:32:57.100,00:32:58.434,Of course.
00:32:58.518,00:33:00.603,"When my kids come back from his office, they seem happy."
00:33:00.687,00:33:01.854,What do you think about it?
00:33:01.938,00:33:02.939,It's wonderful.
00:33:03.439,00:33:05.274,He turns punishment into play.
00:33:05.358,00:33:07.318,He makes it a positive experience.
00:33:07.402,00:33:10.780,-Nothing could be better for them. -Have you had any parent complaints?
00:33:10.863,00:33:14.742,The parents I've talked to are thrilled. Except about property taxes.
00:33:18.121,00:33:19.622,What do you think of Janet Ebner?
00:33:20.748,00:33:24.252,"Well, I don't like to speak ill of people, but she's a busybody."
00:33:25.003,00:33:26.838,What do you think of Mrs. Clark?
00:33:26.921,00:33:27.755,She's a crab.
00:33:29.757,00:33:32.135,Okay. I think that's all we need.
00:33:33.845,00:33:35.513,-Thank you for talking with us. -Thank you.
00:33:35.596,00:33:37.598,-So nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.
00:33:39.642,00:33:42.478,He came home from Steve's house and his tongue was blue.
00:33:46.482,00:33:50.153,"Found out they walked to the corner store without asking, and bought Pop Rocks."
00:33:50.236,00:33:51.821,Boys will be boys.
00:33:51.904,00:33:53.114,That's not the point.
00:33:54.449,00:33:58.995,"We're, uh, in discussions about how much leeway Jason is allowed at this age."
00:33:59.620,00:34:03.708,"Anyway, he's evasive when I ask him where he got the money."
00:34:03.791,00:34:07.670,"So, I call Steve's mom. She's having the same conversation with her son."
00:34:07.754,00:34:09.922,Turns out they got it from Roger.
00:34:10.006,00:34:11.340,The principal...
00:34:11.424,00:34:13.634,giving them money without telling the parents.
00:34:13.718,00:34:22.894,"But then we find out, and this is why Jason wouldn't tell me in the first place, he and Steve were fighting on the playground-- They were kicking mud at each other, they weren't fighting."
00:34:22.977,00:34:26.355,"They were fighting, they got sent to Roger's office."
00:34:26.439,00:34:32.862,"He seats them side by side, makes them take off their shoes and socks, and does this double tickling thing."
00:34:32.945,00:34:35.031,Was Jason uncomfortable with the tickling?
00:34:35.114,00:34:37.408,I don't think Jason understood that it was inappropriate.
00:34:37.492,00:34:40.661,"No, he wasn't uncomfortable. The boys made up again, all buddy-buddy."
00:34:40.745,00:34:43.081,But they're nine-year-olds. Almost ten.
00:34:43.581,00:34:46.125,"I could see it if they were toddlers, if this was preschool."
00:34:46.209,00:34:47.668,And then there's the money.
00:34:50.338,00:34:52.673,He made it sound like we were perverts for even asking.
00:34:52.757,00:34:57.303,"How dare we deny our boy the, um, affection that he provides?"
00:34:57.386,00:35:00.223,Something like that. I came away with the strangest feeling.
00:35:00.306,00:35:06.062,"Yeah, I mean, if you don't want people touching your kid-- A middle-aged man touching your child's feet."
00:35:06.145,00:35:08.356,You should be able to tell them stop.
00:35:08.439,00:35:09.816,Did you ask him to stop?
00:35:09.899,00:35:12.860,"-Absolutely. And he said-- -Oh, yeah, listen to this."
00:35:13.903,00:35:17.156,"My covenant is not with you, it's with your son."
00:35:17.240,00:35:19.200,Covenant? He used that word?
00:35:24.080,00:35:25.289,The whole thing is odd.
00:35:28.000,00:35:29.752,What do you think should be done about him?
00:35:30.920,00:35:32.463,"Well, I thought about suing."
00:35:32.880,00:35:36.634,"We want to protect Jason, but we aren't sure."
00:35:37.260,00:35:40.346,"And he wasn't traumatized. I mean, quite the opposite."
00:35:40.429,00:35:43.808,"We thought you might have suggestions, because we don't know what to do."
00:35:44.475,00:35:45.560,"Yeah, we don't know."
00:35:47.478,00:35:49.814,-I guess they should have a say. -I think they should.
00:35:49.897,00:35:52.233,But is there anything going on? Is Roger dangerous?
00:35:54.318,00:35:55.570,What about when one does?
00:35:55.653,00:35:57.989,Brudos kept his urges in check until something triggered him.
00:35:58.072,00:35:59.866,"After that, everything escalated."
00:35:59.949,00:36:02.618,-What if a kid decides to resist Roger? -I read the Brudos files.
00:36:02.702,00:36:06.080,"-He had a history of offenses. -It's a leap, but there is a correlation."
00:36:09.709,00:36:13.754,"In fact, giving them money might encourage them to go to his office for punishment."
00:36:14.338,00:36:16.299,-Why don't we ask him to stop? -People have.
00:36:16.382,00:36:19.093,Let's tell him then. We're the fucking FBI.
00:36:42.491,00:36:46.954,It's her first year and I think she's having some trouble managing her students.
00:36:47.038,00:36:48.414,"Mr. Wade, can we talk?"
00:36:49.582,00:36:53.169,"And, um, let's make a note -I've signed off on the lesson plan-- -In private?"
00:36:55.630,00:36:56.631,Thank you.
00:37:04.680,00:37:09.268,"After speaking with parents and teachers, we're advising you to stop touching the children."
00:37:09.352,00:37:10.353,Advising me?
00:37:14.315,00:37:15.775,It is not trivial.
00:37:15.858,00:37:18.236,Don't make me sound like some stranger in a raincoat.
00:37:18.319,00:37:19.946,We're here at the request of the superintendent.
00:37:20.029,00:37:20.905,Really?
00:37:29.163,00:37:30.831,I have been a principal for 15 years.
00:37:30.915,00:37:34.794,There hasn't been a shadow on my record until now. How dare you.
00:37:35.503,00:37:40.258,How dare you accuse me of being inappropriate with my own students.
00:37:40.341,00:37:42.551,We're not accusing you. Some people are uncomfortable.
00:37:42.635,00:37:43.636,You are!
00:37:44.262,00:37:46.555,"You are uncomfortable, Agent Ford. Why is that?"
00:37:46.639,00:37:49.350,"When I was here for Career Day, you asked me to edit my speech."
00:37:49.433,00:37:52.228,You were worried how it would affect the teachers and students. So I did.
00:37:52.311,00:37:54.563,"I heard your concerns, I followed your advice."
00:37:54.647,00:38:01.904,I am advising you to hear the concerns of your teachers and your school board-- You didn't know what the hell you were doing that day. You still don't.
00:38:02.405,00:38:04.490,Deviant. Torture. Mutilation.
00:38:04.573,00:38:07.827,"That is your world, and it has made you paranoid."
00:38:07.910,00:38:10.204,That is not my school.
00:38:12.790,00:38:13.958,Mr. Wade.
00:38:14.625,00:38:16.794,I am telling you this for your own good.
00:38:18.879,00:38:21.299,We all have to choose between trust and fear.
00:38:21.632,00:38:27.305,"If you ever do have children, I hope that you'll think long and hard about how you want to raise them."
00:38:31.976,00:38:33.394,Did we do the right thing?
00:38:34.937,00:38:36.480,Is this a federal issue?
00:38:57.460,00:38:58.711,Hey.
00:39:02.298,00:39:04.175,-What are you doing? -Studying.
00:39:05.593,00:39:06.469,Can I come in?
00:39:06.552,00:39:07.762,I really need to study.
00:39:08.429,00:39:09.430,Okay.
00:39:11.432,00:39:14.435,-You really have to leave me alone. -I will. I promise.
00:39:15.144,00:39:16.896,You gotta promise-promise.
00:40:00.439,00:40:01.399,What are you reading?
00:40:03.484,00:40:06.404,The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.
00:40:09.365,00:40:11.534,-Sounds interesting. -It is interesting.
00:40:13.702,00:40:14.995,-What's it about? -Please.
00:40:15.079,00:40:17.289,You promised and I really have to finish this.
00:40:21.669,00:40:23.838,It could help to describe what you're learning.
00:40:27.466,00:40:28.676,Okay.
00:40:28.759,00:40:30.511,It's by Erving Goffman.
00:40:30.594,00:40:32.805,He posits that life is like theater.
00:40:37.143,00:40:38.018,Meaning?
00:40:43.441,00:40:47.611,"You know, I once tried not smiling for a day, and it was really weird."
00:40:48.904,00:40:51.157,Why? You're not much of a smiler.
00:40:51.240,00:40:54.869,"Even so, it made me feel really odd and it freaked people out."
00:40:54.952,00:40:57.413,"Strangers kept asking, Are you okay?"
00:40:57.496,00:41:00.791,-Did you want to smile? -No. Not once I realized what I was doing.
00:41:01.333,00:41:04.712,Goffman says we wear these masks to make everyone else comfortable.
00:41:05.838,00:41:06.881,Like you and your suits.
00:41:06.964,00:41:08.632,We're not talking about my clothes again.
00:41:11.677,00:41:14.763,-I don't want to fit in. -Everyone is trying to fit in.
00:41:14.847,00:41:16.807,"Guess that explains your hippie thing, too."
00:41:16.891,00:41:18.851,My hippie thing?
00:41:18.934,00:41:21.562,"Your peasant tops, long hair, bracelets, leather sandals."
00:41:21.645,00:41:24.231,-Helps you assimilate on campus. -Right.
00:41:25.816,00:41:27.651,What would you wear if no one were looking?
00:41:27.735,00:41:30.112,Probably nothing. What about you?
00:41:36.619,00:41:39.580,I wonder if that's why everyone's so confused about Roger.
00:41:41.332,00:41:48.255,He's taking an activity normally reserved for family members at home and applying it to the wrong environment.
00:41:48.339,00:41:49.924,I think that's different.
00:41:50.007,00:41:52.092,"Look, I can't do this right now."
00:41:52.176,00:41:54.678,I have to finish because it's my semester project.
00:41:54.762,00:41:57.806,"We're doing this thing tomorrow night. Come, if you're interested."
00:42:03.437,00:42:07.858,My partner's making up a questionnaire for them to describe who they think they've met.
00:42:08.609,00:42:09.610,Your partner?
00:42:10.653,00:42:12.404,Yeah. Patrick.
00:42:14.406,00:42:15.574,I see.
00:42:16.367,00:42:17.409,Were you assigned?
00:42:17.493,00:42:19.787,"Well, we're both working on this Goffman book."
00:42:19.870,00:42:21.622,"Oh, so you just have mutual interests."
00:42:22.122,00:42:23.207,I guess so.
00:42:23.290,00:42:24.500,Certainly seems like it.
00:42:26.168,00:42:28.879,Is this you not smiling as part of your experiment or...
00:42:28.963,00:42:31.757,"No, this is just me not smiling."
00:42:33.133,00:42:34.134,Okay.
00:42:42.184,00:42:43.227,Good morning.
00:42:44.144,00:42:45.145,Morning.
00:42:46.730,00:42:47.898,Shepard wants to see you.
00:42:49.275,00:42:50.484,About what?
00:42:50.568,00:42:51.902,Your little field trip.
00:42:55.447,00:42:56.365,How does he know?
00:43:15.009,00:43:17.511,Ah. Agent Ford.
00:43:25.019,00:43:28.063,The superintendent asked me to take a look at the situation.
00:43:28.147,00:43:31.233,"And you said, Oh, yeah, this is exactly what we do here at the FBI."
00:43:31.317,00:43:35.904,"I just thought with the correlations to the Brudos case-- -Are you obsessed with feet? -No, sir."
00:43:35.988,00:43:38.866,Because that is the only connection I can see. It is a thin one.
00:43:38.949,00:43:41.201,There were parents and teachers who were concerned.
00:43:41.285,00:43:42.661,I know the whole damn story.
00:43:43.120,00:43:44.955,We bumped into each other in the cafeteria.
00:43:45.039,00:43:48.292,"This is not about how I know, it is about what the hell were you thinking?"
00:43:48.375,00:43:53.255,"Sir, I thought I would see if the things we're discovering in the interviews could apply to real-life situations."
00:43:53.339,00:43:58.677,The Bureau does not do that. We do not get involved until a crime is committed and has risen to the level of our radar.
00:43:58.761,00:44:03.182,"With all due respect, we've helped local law enforcement solve two murder cases."
00:44:05.768,00:44:07.686,On cases where there were actual crimes.
00:44:07.770,00:44:09.688,I spent a single day on Roger Wade.
00:44:09.772,00:44:12.566,I was worried about children. I had to follow my intuition.
00:44:12.650,00:44:14.318,-Your what? -Mm...
00:44:16.737,00:44:19.114,My intuition started this. I wanted to interview Kemper.
00:44:19.198,00:44:21.617,"Without me, there would be no study, no funding."
00:44:21.700,00:44:25.079,"So now you know everything, is that it? Now you're Superman, with X-ray vision?"
00:44:25.162,00:44:30.250,"No, but I should be allowed a day to-- Predict if someone might commit a crime?"
00:44:31.460,00:44:33.253,"Who are you, the fucking thought police?"
00:44:35.839,00:44:37.216,Thank you both.
00:44:37.299,00:44:41.595,"Agent Smith, in your new BSU position, the last thing you should be following is Agent Ford's intuition."
00:44:57.986,00:45:00.447,"Surprise, surprise, he had my ass."
00:45:00.531,00:45:02.241,"-You handed it to him. -Thanks, Bill."
00:45:02.324,00:45:05.077,"-Don't know what you were thinking. -Apparently, no one does."
00:45:05.160,00:45:07.621,We'd like you to ask before you do something like that again.
00:45:08.539,00:45:10.916,-What? -Your behavior reflects on us.
00:45:10.999,00:45:14.503,You cannot use the study as justification to launch personal campaigns.
00:45:14.586,00:45:16.964,-Is that what you think I'm doing? -I really don't know.
00:45:17.047,00:45:21.677,I can't imagine why you would go after a respected school principal with no history of abuse.
00:45:21.760,00:45:24.638,Because you weren't there. Even Gregg saw something wasn't right.
00:45:24.721,00:45:27.808,It's an incorrect application of the concepts that I'm trying to teach you.
00:45:27.891,00:45:30.811,"-This has nothing to do with concepts. -She's right, Holden."
00:45:31.687,00:45:34.606,What if some guy were tickling Brian's feet?
00:45:34.690,00:45:40.821,"-Don't bring my kid into this. -Not just some guy, but a guy in power, the head of the school where he will be for years."
00:45:40.904,00:45:43.282,"He not only tickles, but gives money for putting up with it."
00:45:43.365,00:45:45.409,Do not use my family as an example.
00:45:48.704,00:45:54.001,"So it looks like Brian is going to get paid to get his feet tickled, and who knows what else, and there's nothing you can do."
00:45:54.084,00:46:01.467,"I'd tell him to take his fucking hands off my kid, just like I'm telling you to stop using him as an excuse for your unprofessional behavior."
00:49:51.697,00:49:53.281,Behavioral Science.
00:49:53.365,00:49:56.326,"-Holden, this is Dan Cobb with the VEA. -Yes, Dan."
00:49:56.410,00:50:02.416,"I'm sorry to bother you this early, but the school board will be meeting today to make their decision regarding Roger Wade."
00:50:02.499,00:50:03.583,What kind of decision?
00:50:03.667,00:50:06.795,"Well, we're thinking about letting him go."
00:50:06.878,00:50:07.754,I see.
00:50:07.838,00:50:10.757,We'd like to know if this would be in line with your recommendation.
00:50:11.425,00:50:13.385,I really can't make a recommendation.
00:50:13.468,00:50:14.886,"Yeah, I get that."
00:50:14.970,00:50:17.097,"To be honest, we've been going in circles."
00:50:17.723,00:50:22.561,What troubles me is I believe he's developed a compulsion that he's justifying as a choice.
00:50:22.644,00:50:26.398,Do you believe it's possible he can do something... inappropriate?
00:50:26.481,00:50:27.482,Well...
00:50:29.234,00:50:32.696,I can't say that his behavior wouldn't escalate to something more serious.
00:50:32.779,00:50:34.698,Right. I see.
00:50:34.781,00:50:37.784,"Well, it sounds like we should be erring on the side of caution."
00:50:40.495,00:50:41.538,I understand.
00:50:41.621,00:50:43.415,"Okay. Listen, thanks for your time."
00:03:18.656,00:03:21.868,-It's like meeting a movie star. -Could be as anti-climactic.
00:03:25.288,00:03:29.000,"I remember staring at this wanted poster of him, trying to figure out..."
00:03:29.334,00:03:31.961,"if I saw him on the street, would I know he was insane?"
00:03:34.839,00:03:38.301,Even went to my neighbors who subscribed to newspapers outside of Milwaukee.
00:03:38.384,00:03:40.511,Holden and his first criminal crush.
00:03:40.595,00:03:44.265,I was home for the summer from college. It really made an impact.
00:03:44.349,00:03:46.726,Nancy didn't sleep for a week when it hit the front page.
00:03:46.809,00:03:48.770,She'd just started nursing school.
00:03:50.521,00:03:52.440,We should've let that suffice as our interview.
00:03:52.523,00:03:55.151,-Saved ourselves a trip out here. -He lied all through it.
00:03:55.235,00:03:56.903,Why? You don't think he'll lie to us?
00:03:57.195,00:03:59.155,Wonder how Bob Greene got him to talk.
00:03:59.239,00:04:00.907,Probably by kissing his ass.
00:04:00.990,00:04:04.118,He called him a romantic figure. He's as bad as you.
00:04:08.081,00:04:09.958,He's almost up there with Manson.
00:04:10.500,00:04:12.585,"Well, maybe he'll give you an autograph."
00:04:16.089,00:04:17.882,"That would be inappropriate, right?"
00:05:09.142,00:05:10.310,All right. Go ahead.
00:05:27.869,00:05:29.329,Deputy Warden Armstrong.
00:05:29.412,00:05:31.331,Holden Ford. This is Bill Tench.
00:05:33.458,00:05:34.917,Thanks for accommodating us.
00:05:35.877,00:05:38.087,You're the ones who painted this place pink?
00:05:38.588,00:05:42.091,"The feds. You know, some psychology thing."
00:05:43.009,00:05:45.219,The color pink was supposed to keep the animals calm.
00:05:45.303,00:05:46.804,How'd that work?
00:05:46.888,00:05:47.889,I don't know.
00:05:48.431,00:05:50.933,They ate it off the bars before we could find out.
00:05:56.481,00:05:58.941,-Is this the only way through? -This is the way.
00:05:59.275,00:06:02.612,"We prefer to come in quietly, make it look like a civil rights investigation."
00:06:02.695,00:06:04.530,"Look around, how am I supposed to hide you?"
00:06:04.614,00:06:07.575,"We didn't want him to be seen as a snitch, suffer reprisals."
00:06:07.658,00:06:10.912,"As far as I'm concerned, he could suffer the burning flames of hell for eternity."
00:06:10.995,00:06:14.082,"-Okay, but that's not what we agreed to. -God, take it easy."
00:06:14.165,00:06:16.709,We pulled him to toss his cell. Do it twice a month.
00:06:16.793,00:06:18.544,It'll look like business as usual.
00:06:27.637,00:06:29.847,How does a man who slaughtered eight women have groupies?
00:06:29.931,00:06:33.643,Hundreds of them. Keeps the whole prison stocked in smut.
00:06:37.063,00:06:38.314,Stay behind me.
00:06:42.151,00:06:43.861,Get off of me! I'll fuck you up.
00:06:44.487,00:06:47.573,"I'll fuck you so hard, your asshole will come out your motherfucking mouth!"
00:06:51.035,00:06:51.953,Son of a bitch!
00:06:52.036,00:06:56.332,"Fuck your mama's hairy fucking asshole, you cock-sucking peckerwood!"
00:06:56.416,00:06:58.584,"Shit-bag, motherfucking twat!"
00:06:58.668,00:07:04.757,"I'm gonna shit in your goddamn fucking poontang, you fuck-ass-- Get off me, you cracker!"
00:07:05.591,00:07:08.344,I ain't talking to the motherfucking FBI!
00:07:14.225,00:07:16.310,Fuck you in your fucking mouth.
00:07:21.023,00:07:23.276,I'm not talking to no faggot feds.
00:07:26.237,00:07:28.865,Stick your background up your fucking ass.
00:07:29.699,00:07:32.285,"You're here, and we're gonna ask you a few questions."
00:07:32.368,00:07:36.080,"We can make it brief, or you can scream your head off and take all day."
00:07:36.164,00:07:37.665,You fucking turned my cell out.
00:07:37.748,00:07:40.001,How'd you like it if I looked up your fucking cracks?
00:07:40.084,00:07:43.880,I wouldn't like it at all. Going through your cell was not our idea.
00:07:46.799,00:07:47.800,Please.
00:07:48.384,00:07:49.552,Have a seat.
00:08:10.948,00:08:14.785,We're conducting interviews with people who've been convicted of violent crimes.
00:08:14.869,00:08:21.834,"We'll be asking about family history, antecedent behavior, and thought patterns -surrounding the crimes-- -Fuck you, Hoover boys."
00:08:29.050,00:08:30.801,Beg your pardon. Fuck you.
00:08:32.178,00:08:33.262,We know your name.
00:08:35.056,00:08:36.516,Everybody knows your name.
00:08:39.227,00:08:40.686,Who else you talking to?
00:08:44.440,00:08:46.025,-I'm not like them. -No?
00:08:46.400,00:08:48.236,Don't think you've committed violent crimes?
00:08:48.319,00:08:49.320,I didn't say that.
00:08:51.781,00:08:53.366,Them fuckers are crazy.
00:08:55.826,00:08:56.869,Is that a bird?
00:09:00.248,00:09:01.374,Where'd you get it?
00:09:04.585,00:09:07.004,I fed it meatloaf through an eyedropper.
00:09:07.088,00:09:08.172,Oh...
00:09:08.881,00:09:10.299,Did you give it a name?
00:09:11.092,00:09:12.677,They let you keep a pet here?
00:09:12.760,00:09:14.720,As long as I suck their dicks.
00:09:17.890,00:09:22.687,"It won't surprise you, Richard, that we want to talk about July 14, 1966."
00:09:23.271,00:09:25.898,"You'd been drinking since the morning, is that correct?"
00:09:27.483,00:09:33.364,"You'd gone a few times to the Maritime Union to see about getting a job, but nothing had panned out."
00:09:33.823,00:09:35.783,Did this influence your state of mind?
00:09:39.203,00:09:48.337,"You drank at the Shipyard's Inn Tavern until after 10:00 p.m., when you walked over a mile to 2319 100th Street."
00:09:49.463,00:09:52.008,Did anything about the nurse's apartment catch your eye?
00:09:54.552,00:09:57.930,Was it your intention to commit robbery when you went to the door?
00:10:06.480,00:10:08.274,May I see your... tattoo?
00:10:11.235,00:10:14.697,I read about it. I collected these pieces on you.
00:10:14.780,00:10:16.532,The tattoo is kind of legendary.
00:10:17.074,00:10:18.826,I always wondered what it looked like.
00:10:22.079,00:10:23.873,You're gonna have to roll up my sleeve.
00:10:25.750,00:10:26.959,Okay.
00:10:27.043,00:10:29.837,"Well, come here, then, little boy."
00:10:38.387,00:10:41.349,"You want to pet my bird, too?"
00:10:51.817,00:10:56.072,"You went to the nurse's apartment, knocked on the door, one of the young women answered it."
00:10:56.489,00:11:00.826,"You flashed a knife at her, pushed your way inside, realized there were several women home."
00:11:00.910,00:11:03.621,Was it still your intention to rob them at this point?
00:11:06.207,00:11:08.376,At what point did you decide to kill them?
00:11:13.255,00:11:14.590,-I'm sorry. -What?
00:11:14.674,00:11:15.966,I gotta ask.
00:11:18.511,00:11:24.600,What gave you the right to take eight ripe cunts out of the world?
00:11:25.559,00:11:26.811,Some of them looked pretty good.
00:11:27.728,00:11:30.064,You ever think you were depriving the rest of us?
00:11:31.941,00:11:35.027,Eight hot pieces of ass.
00:11:36.737,00:11:37.905,You think that's fair?
00:11:42.451,00:11:43.786,You're crazy.
00:11:44.745,00:11:46.997,That's a fine line that separates you from me.
00:11:47.081,00:11:49.709,How the hell did you even fuck eight women the same night?
00:11:49.792,00:11:51.001,"What do you eat for breakfast, gunpowder?"
00:11:51.085,00:11:52.920,-All right. -I didn't fuck all of them.
00:11:53.003,00:11:55.214,That story got blowed all out of proportion.
00:11:55.798,00:11:58.259,-I only fucked one of them. -The one on the couch?
00:12:02.054,00:12:03.139,They kept coming.
00:12:06.600,00:12:10.062,"I put one in the bedroom, one in the closet."
00:12:10.146,00:12:11.480,You corralled them like ponies?
00:12:14.024,00:12:16.360,"Once I killed one, I had to kill all of them."
00:12:17.778,00:12:20.573,"She was crying and all, she was fucking loud."
00:12:21.157,00:12:24.618,"You told Bob Greene she spit in your eye, said she'd pick you out of a lineup."
00:12:24.702,00:12:26.954,"That son of a bitch, I should've never talked to him."
00:12:30.416,00:12:33.043,"-I just wanted to kick back. -Do your heroin, drink your hootch?"
00:12:33.127,00:12:35.045,-That's right. -Where do you get that stuff?
00:12:37.631,00:12:39.717,-Made my own still. -You made a still?
00:12:39.800,00:12:43.971,Hid it in a drawer in a guards' desk. Right under their fucking nose.
00:12:44.054,00:12:45.973,They couldn't figure out what the stink was.
00:12:46.056,00:12:48.642,Was that true about the first girl? She spit at you?
00:12:48.726,00:12:52.271,"-Because they all sounded pretty timid. -All right, she got after me."
00:12:52.646,00:12:54.064,I told her to shut up.
00:12:56.400,00:12:59.111,-Then why kill her? -'Cause I wanted to.
00:13:00.946,00:13:01.864,Choked her.
00:13:04.283,00:13:06.076,Is that why you stabbed the others?
00:13:06.160,00:13:07.828,-It was faster? -That's right.
00:13:08.537,00:13:11.999,"Originally, you told them you weren't gonna kill them, just rob them."
00:13:12.082,00:13:13.334,I guess I fucking lied.
00:13:16.253,00:13:18.047,I just decided to kill them.
00:13:19.340,00:13:20.508,Except the one.
00:13:21.258,00:13:22.551,She was a sneaky bitch.
00:13:22.635,00:13:24.094,Hid under a bed.
00:13:25.304,00:13:27.932,"You know, I never did have much use for math."
00:13:28.015,00:13:31.519,"And all them girls, I lost count."
00:13:31.602,00:13:33.729,And there was blood fucking everywhere.
00:13:33.813,00:13:35.981,"Yep, they all looked dead to me."
00:13:37.399,00:13:42.321,except maybe start crying when they realized this was it.
00:13:44.698,00:13:45.950,Ever wonder why you did it?
00:13:46.033,00:13:47.243,No.
00:13:51.413,00:13:52.915,until peckers like you show up.
00:13:55.626,00:13:57.044,Don't know what you're talking about.
00:14:03.676,00:14:05.177,-How I got cut. -Who'd you fight?
00:14:05.261,00:14:06.971,Some river coon trying to hustle.
00:14:10.182,00:14:11.725,"-You killed him, too? -Shit, yeah."
00:14:11.809,00:14:15.271,-I didn't see that in the paper. -Because nobody gives a fuck about that.
00:14:16.313,00:14:18.232,You lost a lot of blood.
00:14:18.732,00:14:21.443,-Did it hurt? -I didn't feel fucking nothing.
00:14:22.403,00:14:24.321,-Do you still feel nothing? -That's right.
00:14:31.662,00:14:33.247,you didn't feel bad about those girls?
00:14:33.330,00:14:34.915,"I told you, I didn't do that."
00:14:38.168,00:14:40.421,Maybe you were feeling sorry for yourself.
00:14:40.504,00:14:41.881,"Fuck you, peckerhead!"
00:14:49.471,00:14:51.432,Because it just wasn't their fucking night.
00:14:55.603,00:14:56.979,"Well, that was fucked up."
00:14:59.732,00:15:04.153,"When he started talking about feeding it through an eyedropper, I actually felt sorry for the guy."
00:15:10.034,00:15:12.244,Audio is never gonna do it justice.
00:15:17.082,00:15:18.584,Imagine that for posterity.
00:15:21.378,00:15:23.923,It just wasn't their night.
00:15:32.139,00:15:34.266,You might want to consider losing the tape.
00:15:35.434,00:15:38.395,Or saying it got mangled. The recorder chewed it.
00:15:38.479,00:15:40.022,Why would I do that?
00:15:41.148,00:15:42.608,Eight ripe cunts.
00:15:42.691,00:15:45.235,-I was getting him talking. -That excuse is wearing thin.
00:15:45.319,00:15:47.780,"Bill, don't get caught up in semantics."
00:15:47.863,00:15:51.241,"I don't like the language, and I know at least one person who won't either."
00:15:51.325,00:15:53.953,-Am I supposed to be cowed by Wendy? -I'm just saying...
00:15:54.036,00:15:55.955,You pushed back when she reamed us about Brudos.
00:15:56.038,00:15:58.374,Because we got something worthwhile from him.
00:15:58.832,00:16:00.376,I can do this stuff.
00:16:00.459,00:16:05.089,"I can choke down the bile, manufacture empathy, when our subjects are at least informative."
00:16:05.172,00:16:07.800,"-You couldn't choke it down with Brudos-- -Shut up, let me finish."
00:16:10.803,00:16:13.973,The fact that his death sentence was commuted is a national disgrace.
00:16:14.056,00:16:16.016,We decided no one was beneath our contempt.
00:16:16.100,00:16:17.434,That snail didn't change your mind?
00:16:17.518,00:16:19.645,-We can learn from snails. -What did we learn?
00:16:19.728,00:16:24.024,That some subjects have no idea what's behind the horrific acts they commit.
00:16:24.108,00:16:26.527,It was disgusting. I don't want to be part of it.
00:16:26.610,00:16:31.490,"-When did you get thin-skinned? -I'm trying to warn you, your attitude is gonna bite you in the ass."
00:16:32.908,00:16:37.830,There is no dishonor in losing at least the first three minutes of that tape.
00:16:37.913,00:16:40.916,"Ladies and gentlemen, we will be arriving at Dulles momentarily."
00:16:41.000,00:16:43.252,Please make sure your seat belts are fastened.
00:16:43.335,00:16:46.213,Tray tables and seat backs should be in their upright and locked position.
00:17:58.744,00:18:02.206,"there are some things in this interview that were important to, uh..."
00:18:03.332,00:18:06.835,But maybe best kept off the permanent record.
00:18:37.491,00:18:39.368,He admits to raping only one of the women.
00:18:41.411,00:18:42.704,He wasn't initially forthcoming.
00:18:42.788,00:18:46.458,I believe I asked him how he managed to have sex with all those nurses.
00:18:49.878,00:18:52.631,-I guess so. -This rape was committed reflexively.
00:18:52.714,00:18:57.344,"The crime scene photos indicate that she was facedown on the couch, so she was already depersonalized to him."
00:18:57.427,00:19:00.097,It was probably just a what the fuck fuck.
00:19:01.473,00:19:05.727,"So he goes to the boardinghouse drunk, looking for someone to rob."
00:19:05.811,00:19:08.438,And then he finds himself in this situation with all these women.
00:19:08.522,00:19:11.066,He corrals them and then he rapes one of them.
00:19:12.276,00:19:14.361,-To prove he can? -Statement of sexual competence.
00:19:14.444,00:19:21.034,"Which he later exaggerates in the interview, He turned his suicide attempt into a bar fight."
00:19:21.118,00:19:22.661,"Yeah, projecting machismo."
00:19:24.246,00:19:27.624,It would be interesting to know how old he was when he got that tattoo.
00:19:27.708,00:19:31.170,Because that was the conscious decision for him to brand himself a badass.
00:19:31.253,00:19:34.464,We didn't get much history. The bird in the fan kind of ended things.
00:19:36.592,00:19:39.678,You had just accused him of cowardice by attempting suicide.
00:19:39.761,00:19:41.847,And nobody born to raise hell is a coward.
00:19:41.930,00:19:43.557,The bird was just further demonstration.
00:19:43.640,00:19:52.399,"I like the part where he doesn't want to be lumped in with other subjects Speck is powerful, superior, exceptional."
00:19:52.482,00:19:55.402,But did we learn anything new? Anything that wasn't in our files?
00:19:57.654,00:20:00.699,Every single act he committed was... spontaneous.
00:20:02.242,00:20:06.496,"Speck was so out of it, the woman who answered the door was the only one he forgot to kill."
00:20:10.334,00:20:13.378,We need terminology to distinguish a Kemper from a Speck.
00:20:13.462,00:20:22.888,"One drives around with ropes, knives, plastic bags in his trunk and returns to a specific hunting ground looking for specific prey, while the other just happens upon his victims."
00:20:22.971,00:20:24.389,Organized and disorganized?
00:20:27.851,00:20:29.937,"For example, Charles Whitman is similar to Speck."
00:20:30.020,00:20:32.189,He killed 14 people in 90 minutes.
00:20:32.689,00:20:35.817,"-He's not a sequence killer, he's... -Whitman was on a spree."
00:20:37.319,00:20:39.321,-Just wasn't their night. -Bill?
00:20:40.489,00:20:43.116,Spree is good for Speck or Whitman.
00:20:43.200,00:20:45.827,But I think sequence killer is wrong for someone like Kemper.
00:20:48.288,00:20:52.459,It should feel like a long story. Continually updated.
00:20:52.542,00:20:53.752,A series of killings.
00:20:53.835,00:20:55.712,-Serial? -Serial murderer?
00:20:55.796,00:20:56.838,Serial killer?
00:21:05.180,00:21:13.981,"Another year to complete my Masters, a year of exams to get a doctoral candidacy, and the dissertation takes two if you're extremely motivated, usually four."
00:21:14.064,00:21:17.150,-You drink out of these? -Just the one that's drying.
00:21:17.234,00:21:18.819,Store them upside down.
00:21:21.321,00:21:24.700,"-Anyway, I'll be 30 before I get my PhD. -That's still impressive."
00:21:24.783,00:21:28.078,Is that why I'm doing this? Who am I trying to impress?
00:21:28.161,00:21:30.038,-I thought you loved this stuff. -This stuff?
00:21:30.122,00:21:34.126,"Yeah, the sociological constructs that you're always espousing."
00:21:34.543,00:21:37.796,-The Goffman and the Higel-- -Hegel.
00:21:37.879,00:21:39.256,-Hegel. -I knew it.
00:21:41.550,00:21:49.683,"I'm talking generally, not trying to minimize-- You perk up when I talk about something that has to do with your work, -but the rest of the time-- -I don't think you can put this on me."
00:21:49.975,00:21:54.813,You've made it clear I'm not to get between you and your-- Stuff. Maybe that's all this is.
00:21:54.896,00:21:58.984,Maybe that's why I'm wondering if I want to spend the rest of my life-- Just now doing the math?
00:21:59.067,00:22:02.571,"Not all of us land feet first in our ideal vocation, Mr. Ford."
00:22:02.654,00:22:20.130,"-You think that's me? -You've found this microscopic niche interviewing freaks, and you couldn't be better-- -Hello? -Mr. Ford, I have a Mrs. Wade to see you."
00:22:20.213,00:22:23.925,"-Who? -Uh, she says-- What is this regarding, ma'am?"
00:22:25.635,00:22:28.555,-She's the wife of someone you had fired. -Oh.
00:22:28.638,00:22:31.308,She says to remind you of someone named Roger.
00:22:31.391,00:22:32.225,Okay.
00:22:32.309,00:22:34.186,"If you'd like, I can call somebody."
00:22:35.103,00:22:36.355,Send her up.
00:22:40.567,00:22:41.568,What?
00:22:45.947,00:22:46.907,What is it?
00:23:02.547,00:23:03.840,Mr. Ford?
00:23:03.924,00:23:05.050,Mrs. Wade.
00:23:05.634,00:23:06.885,That's right.
00:23:06.968,00:23:08.678,How did you find me?
00:23:08.762,00:23:10.013,It took a while.
00:23:11.932,00:23:14.476,You might not want to follow a federal agent.
00:23:15.644,00:23:17.145,There could be consequences.
00:23:17.687,00:23:19.022,You're just a kid.
00:23:20.107,00:23:23.610,-What do you want? -So young to be ruining people's lives.
00:23:23.693,00:23:27.572,-Mrs. Wade. -I'm sure you're aware that Roger was let go by the school district.
00:23:29.408,00:23:30.784,I was not aware.
00:23:30.867,00:23:33.620,Which means he can never again work in Prince William County.
00:23:34.871,00:23:37.332,We've been in our home for 23 years.
00:23:37.416,00:23:41.169,"We have a daughter who's still in high school, so moving is impossible."
00:23:49.052,00:23:54.307,"as a guidance counselor, a substitute teacher."
00:23:55.308,00:23:59.646,But no one wants him near children. And children are his life.
00:23:59.729,00:24:06.903,"I am very sorry to hear that, but I had nothing to do with your husband-- I understand you told the superintendent he could be a pedophile."
00:24:06.987,00:24:08.155,You've been misinformed.
00:24:17.080,00:24:20.375,Roger was going against the wishes of faculty and parents.
00:24:20.459,00:24:23.628,-He'd been given every opportunity to-- -He did nothing wrong!
00:24:28.717,00:24:30.302,I don't know what to tell you.
00:24:31.928,00:24:33.638,I almost don't know him anymore.
00:24:38.477,00:24:44.024,"He doesn't sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night, he's in the living room, staring at snow on the television."
00:24:45.358,00:24:47.486,He's almost 50 years old.
00:24:52.532,00:24:54.493,We were respected in the community.
00:24:58.413,00:25:02.542,"Suddenly, people who've known us for years pretend they don't see him on the street."
00:25:02.626,00:25:07.255,Someone spray-painted kiddie fucker on our driveway.
00:25:14.554,00:25:16.181,You're very young as well.
00:25:17.474,00:25:20.060,Do you know what kind of person you're married to?
00:25:20.560,00:25:22.229,We're not married.
00:25:23.813,00:25:25.106,Then there's still time.
00:25:31.947,00:25:33.031,What did you do?
00:25:33.114,00:25:34.115,Nothing.
00:26:44.477,00:26:47.063,-What am I looking at? -Came in from the Atlanta field office.
00:26:48.189,00:26:51.192,Twelve-year-old girl raped and murdered after she got off the school bus.
00:27:00.827,00:27:03.622,"Contact the case lead, see if he'll send us more info."
00:27:06.708,00:27:10.462,Lisa Dawn Porter disappeared after being dropped off at the driveway to her house.
00:27:10.545,00:27:13.340,"Her body was found in a wooded area, ten miles away."
00:27:13.423,00:27:17.510,"Cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head, probably from this rock."
00:27:17.594,00:27:19.804,Marks indicate manual strangulation from behind.
00:27:19.888,00:27:21.848,-She was a cheerleader? -Majorette.
00:27:23.433,00:27:25.352,"They march with the school band, twirl batons."
00:27:25.435,00:27:28.146,What else do we know about her? Habits? Personality?
00:27:28.730,00:27:30.357,"By all reports, she was a good girl."
00:27:30.440,00:27:33.777,"No drugs, no alcohol, no boyfriends anyone knows of."
00:27:42.285,00:27:45.413,"They think she was raped in a vehicle, but killed in the woods."
00:27:45.497,00:27:47.707,-Disheveled how? -The buttons were misaligned.
00:27:47.791,00:27:52.212,"So she undressed, probably when the unsub raped her, and then she got dressed again in a hurry."
00:27:57.008,00:27:58.510,He put the coat over her face?
00:28:00.720,00:28:02.764,A young couple noticed it walking through the woods.
00:28:02.847,00:28:04.182,What do you think that means?
00:28:06.601,00:28:11.272,"If he places it over her head, it's like he's covering up what he's done."
00:28:13.858,00:28:15.860,That's consistent with her getting dressed.
00:28:15.944,00:28:17.112,He's concerned for her.
00:28:17.195,00:28:19.239,In that way that child rapists can be concerned.
00:28:20.031,00:28:22.492,Let's say there's shame. What does that tell us about him?
00:28:26.538,00:28:28.164,-He's young? -How young?
00:28:28.790,00:28:31.501,Maybe another teenager? Someone that knew her?
00:28:31.584,00:28:35.797,"Strangulation. Even 12-year-olds rarely comply, takes real strength."
00:28:37.298,00:28:39.217,-Mid to late 20s? -That's where I'd put him.
00:28:39.300,00:28:42.721,He intercepted her between the bus stop and her home only a short distance away.
00:28:42.804,00:28:45.181,It's possible he knew when she was coming home from school.
00:28:45.265,00:28:48.810,"The woods where she was found is a known make-out spot for locals, so..."
00:28:53.022,00:28:54.733,-They knew each other? -Can't assume that.
00:28:54.816,00:28:56.568,He could have threatened her at gun or knifepoint.
00:28:58.194,00:29:01.489,"then he probably planned the kidnapping, which means he likely planned the rape."
00:29:04.242,00:29:05.869,What does the crime scene tell us?
00:29:11.082,00:29:13.460,-He left the murder weapon by the body. -And the yellow jacket?
00:29:13.543,00:29:15.587,-Um... -It's the opposite of hiding her.
00:29:17.338,00:29:20.091,"All of this indicates a disorganized, spontaneous act."
00:29:23.219,00:29:25.180,"He planned the rape, he didn't plan the murder."
00:29:25.263,00:29:27.182,-He might even feel bad about it. -Nice.
00:29:28.349,00:29:32.520,Thanks. So I should get back to them and tell them what we're thinking.
00:29:32.604,00:29:34.314,Are they expecting to hear back?
00:29:34.647,00:29:36.524,"Yeah. This isn't just an exercise, is it?"
00:29:50.830,00:29:54.292,"Eighty yards to the driveway, a hundred yards to the house?"
00:29:59.005,00:30:00.924,"She didn't see anything, hear anything."
00:30:01.007,00:30:02.717,So he probably picked her up on the road.
00:30:02.801,00:30:05.929,"We think someone was waiting for her, knew when the bus would drop her off."
00:30:07.680,00:30:09.432,"You checked out family, friends?"
00:30:09.766,00:30:12.644,Looking into it. No red flags so far.
00:30:12.727,00:30:14.604,We're sure there's no boyfriend in the picture?
00:30:14.687,00:30:17.732,"All her girlfriends say no, even on the sly."
00:30:17.816,00:30:18.817,Was she popular?
00:30:21.986,00:30:23.988,-Majorette? -Mm-hmm. That's right.
00:30:24.072,00:30:27.909,The outfit is flashy. Shows off her legs. Might have been what caught his eye.
00:30:29.327,00:30:30.829,They found it in her backpack.
00:30:34.332,00:30:35.875,He must have been watching her.
00:30:37.585,00:30:40.421,-Who would have reason to be out here? -This is farmland.
00:30:40.839,00:30:42.006,Seasonal workers?
00:30:42.924,00:30:44.467,"Well, I can check."
00:30:44.551,00:30:47.470,"The area where she was found, it was familiar to locals?"
00:30:47.762,00:30:50.014,It's known as a lovers' lane.
00:30:50.098,00:30:52.058,-Lovers' lane? -Jesus.
00:30:52.141,00:30:55.979,-Could he have thought of it as a date? -He truly was not thinking ahead.
00:30:56.771,00:30:59.023,We don't believe the unsub planned the murder.
00:30:59.107,00:31:00.900,He certainly didn't try to cover it up.
00:31:01.359,00:31:04.988,"Like Gregg said, if he knows about a lovers' lane, he could be from the area."
00:31:08.157,00:31:12.036,See what records you've got on young men in the Floyd and Bartow Counties.
00:31:12.120,00:31:13.955,-Yep. -How often does this get done?
00:31:14.873,00:31:16.416,-Hm? -The trees.
00:31:16.499,00:31:18.418,They've been cleared around the power lines.
00:31:23.339,00:31:24.883,"Well, this is rural Georgia."
00:31:26.384,00:31:27.510,Not very often.
00:31:27.594,00:31:29.304,"Well, those limbs are freshly cut."
00:31:30.638,00:31:32.807,You think a service crew might have been out here?
00:31:35.351,00:31:36.352,Thank you.
00:31:38.146,00:31:40.481,I just got off a call with Floyd County.
00:31:40.565,00:31:44.110,They say they recently questioned a guy about the rape of a 13-year-old girl.
00:31:44.193,00:31:46.029,He works for a tree-limbing service.
00:31:46.112,00:31:48.865,-He spent a week on the Porter's street. -Bingo.
00:31:49.282,00:31:52.243,"Name's Darrell Gene Devier, 24 years old."
00:31:52.327,00:31:53.828,High school dropout.
00:31:53.912,00:31:57.665,"Was in the army, went AWOL, discharged after seven months."
00:31:57.749,00:31:59.751,-Couldn't handle the military. -Disorganized.
00:31:59.834,00:32:01.586,-Makes sense. -Single? Married?
00:32:02.045,00:32:04.839,Married and divorced twice. Living with his first ex-wife.
00:32:04.923,00:32:07.383,"Sexually and socially competent, if indecisive."
00:32:07.467,00:32:08.593,Can't get over the young girls.
00:32:08.676,00:32:11.095,"Every afternoon, he watches Lisa get off the bus."
00:32:11.179,00:32:14.432,"She's got a sunny disposition, maybe she even talks to him."
00:32:14.515,00:32:22.732,"He sees her in her majorette outfit. It makes her look a little older than 12, and he's able to justify his attraction to her, maybe even fantasize that she would enjoy having sex with him."
00:32:22.815,00:32:26.569,"But once he's assaulted her, she is terrified, she's in pain, she's crying."
00:32:26.653,00:32:28.029,Not fun. The fantasy's over.
00:32:28.112,00:32:30.698,"He realizes, to get away with it, he has to kill her."
00:32:31.616,00:32:34.994,"Has her get dressed, he'll let her go. When she turns around, he strangles her."
00:32:35.078,00:32:36.704,"It's harder than he thought, he can't finish."
00:32:38.957,00:32:42.585,"After, perhaps shocked at what he's done or ashamed, he puts the coat over her head."
00:32:47.256,00:32:50.677,The outcome of the polygraph can depend on the quality of the questions.
00:32:50.760,00:32:52.679,We use it all the time. It's standard procedure.
00:32:52.762,00:32:55.682,"If he's a sociopath, he doesn't register emotions the way we do."
00:33:03.022,00:33:05.108,He had the confidence to take a human life.
00:33:05.191,00:33:07.860,"If he beats the polygraph, he'll think he's Superman."
00:33:16.160,00:33:20.164,We have a branch of the Department of Justice called the Office of Professional Responsibility.
00:33:20.248,00:33:21.165,That sounds very bad.
00:33:21.249,00:33:23.334,They look into allegations of official misconduct.
00:33:23.418,00:33:26.421,"Usually there's nothing to it, but they can make your life difficult."
00:33:26.504,00:33:29.716,They are considering investigating the unit for a civil rights violation.
00:33:29.799,00:33:30.925,Is this about Brudos?
00:33:32.301,00:33:33.469,This is about Richard Speck.
00:33:34.512,00:33:38.683,He was jumped by a couple inmates after the interview conducted by Agents Tench and Ford.
00:33:43.271,00:33:46.858,How the agents interact with the prison administration is not my purview.
00:33:46.941,00:33:49.610,Understood. That's not really the charge I'm worried about.
00:33:49.694,00:33:54.574,Speck also wants to cite Agent Ford for fucking with his head.
00:33:54.657,00:33:55.491,Anything specific?
00:33:55.575,00:33:57.994,"No, but we have all suffered Agent Ford's head fucking."
00:33:58.077,00:34:00.955,-Indeed. -So it has an ominous ring of truth.
00:34:01.706,00:34:04.459,What is the format for evaluating these subjects?
00:34:04.542,00:34:08.379,"A short script and a questionnaire, but the agents don't always adhere to it."
00:34:08.463,00:34:09.672,Why did you mention Brudos?
00:34:10.673,00:34:19.640,"During his interview, Brudos was obfuscating, so the agents brought in a woman's shoe to elicit a response."
00:34:21.225,00:34:23.853,"If I were being polite, I'd call it bad improvisation."
00:34:24.228,00:34:28.274,I'm asking all of this because no one's crying for Richard Speck.
00:34:28.357,00:34:31.110,He can file a complaint and they are required to look into it.
00:34:31.194,00:34:37.283,"But these internal affairs types justify their existence by finding dirt, and I want to make sure there's nothing here."
00:34:37.366,00:34:38.826,-Nothing that I can think of. -Good.
00:34:38.910,00:34:42.330,Tell the boys that the OPR would like to see them at their earliest convenience.
00:34:42.413,00:34:45.458,"They should take all their materials, everything Speck-related."
00:34:45.541,00:34:48.419,"You know, I don't want to be their boss."
00:34:48.503,00:34:51.214,I'll be the boss. You be the messenger.
00:34:52.548,00:34:53.549,All right.
00:35:00.181,00:35:03.184,Fucking Richard Speck filed a complaint? That piece of shit.
00:35:03.267,00:35:04.811,We violated his rights.
00:35:04.894,00:35:07.313,Those morons at Joliet didn't do a thing I asked.
00:35:07.396,00:35:10.399,"Okay, so tell the OPR that. It sounds like it is just a formality."
00:35:10.483,00:35:11.651,It's a pain in the ass.
00:35:11.734,00:35:14.612,It shows they're interested. Take everything that you've got on Speck.
00:35:14.695,00:35:18.074,"-Like what? -Like the file, the tape, transcript."
00:35:20.952,00:35:22.203,You're coming with us.
00:35:31.462,00:35:32.797,Hey. Hey.
00:35:33.923,00:35:35.258,The transcript is fine.
00:36:31.355,00:36:32.565,Please state your names.
00:36:33.149,00:36:34.692,Special Agent William Tench.
00:36:34.775,00:36:36.444,Special Agent Holden Ford.
00:36:36.903,00:36:38.487,Special Agent Gregg Smith.
00:36:39.405,00:36:42.617,In what capacity do you serve the Federal Bureau of Investigation?
00:36:43.117,00:36:44.202,For the record.
00:36:44.827,00:36:46.704,We're in the Behavioral Science Unit.
00:36:46.787,00:36:48.456,How would you summarize what you do?
00:36:48.539,00:36:51.125,-Research. -Could you be more specific?
00:36:52.835,00:37:03.638,"funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and the National Institute of Justice to interview criminals convicted of violent crimes, classify their behavior, and create a profiling manual for domestic law enforcement."
00:37:03.763,00:37:04.597,Hm.
00:37:05.264,00:37:13.481,You're here because we have complaints filed against the Bureau by the Illinois Department of Corrections on behalf of an inmate who claims you knowingly put him in danger with your visitation.
00:37:13.564,00:37:15.274,-Richard Speck. -That's right.
00:37:15.358,00:37:19.278,"If I may, we made arrangements that we felt would guarantee his safety."
00:37:19.362,00:37:23.324,"When we arrived, the deputy warden took it upon himself to ignore all of them."
00:37:26.535,00:37:28.537,I have their faxed agreement to our terms.
00:37:33.876,00:37:38.214,"The inmate said you, quote, fucked with his head, unquote."
00:37:38.297,00:37:41.801,I'm sure the nature of my questioning brought back uncomfortable memories.
00:37:45.054,00:37:47.682,His sexual performance. Stuff like that.
00:37:52.853,00:37:55.189,We usually have to improvise.
00:37:59.777,00:38:01.028,Speak his language?
00:38:01.112,00:38:02.363,Get into his rhythm.
00:38:02.446,00:38:04.740,I'm assuming you have a record of the interview.
00:38:04.824,00:38:06.033,We have a transcript.
00:38:07.868,00:38:09.161,Gregg?
00:38:18.296,00:38:19.505,Tape? You have the tape?
00:38:20.756,00:38:24.719,We reuse our tapes. I'm afraid that we erased that interview.
00:38:27.680,00:38:29.223,You erased the interview?
00:38:29.849,00:38:30.891,Yes.
00:38:32.643,00:38:35.271,We recommend you do not do that in the future.
00:38:37.523,00:38:41.569,I'm assuming your funding would cover the purchase and archiving of audio tapes.
00:38:41.652,00:38:42.570,"Yes, sir."
00:38:44.030,00:38:46.615,Are there other materials you have to share with us?
00:38:47.158,00:38:50.077,These are the pre- and post-interview notes on the inmate.
00:38:50.578,00:38:51.787,Should be everything.
00:38:51.871,00:38:54.707,"Gentlemen, we'll review these and keep you updated on our findings."
00:38:54.790,00:38:58.753,"What we expect from you during this process, more than anything, is candor."
00:39:06.427,00:39:08.637,"Richard Speck, what a shit stain, huh?"
00:39:11.515,00:39:12.683,Read to the end.
00:39:12.767,00:39:14.643,We should have kept the tape just for that.
00:39:16.354,00:39:18.356,"-Fascinating. -Thanks, guys."
00:39:22.693,00:39:24.653,I'm soaking. I sweat right through my shirt.
00:39:24.737,00:39:27.239,-I noticed. -I'm not good at this.
00:39:30.576,00:39:33.412,What should we do with the tape? Destroy it?
00:39:33.496,00:39:35.289,Probably. Where is it?
00:39:41.587,00:39:45.091,"It's a prison interview, not Watergate."
00:39:51.305,00:39:53.933,-What's going on? -Maybe you can tell us that.
00:39:57.603,00:40:00.314,"Holden, would you care to do the honors?"
00:40:07.530,00:40:09.490,"We gave them a transcript, that's all."
00:40:09.573,00:40:10.991,"So you're in on this, too?"
00:40:12.034,00:40:15.746,"Well, Agent Ford approached me-- Do not say, Holden made me do it."
00:40:16.831,00:40:18.833,I don't even know where to begin. Wendy?
00:40:18.916,00:40:20.751,Eight ripe cunts?
00:40:20.835,00:40:23.295,"-Sure, let's start there. -Jesus, not this again."
00:40:26.173,00:40:28.884,-So you must have known it was sensitive. -Sensitive for some people.
00:40:28.968,00:40:30.886,-Meaning me. -I don't like it either.
00:40:30.970,00:40:34.557,We can't like everything we do. We're talking to serial killers.
00:40:34.640,00:40:37.017,-Serial killers? -New terminology.
00:40:39.562,00:40:43.357,Never mind that we are answerable to the LEAA and the NIJ.
00:40:43.441,00:40:48.863,"This study is funded with Congressional dollars, taxpayer money, which means your interviews are public record."
00:40:50.239,00:40:52.283,I really don't have a problem with this being public.
00:40:52.366,00:40:55.453,All of us have to go along with what you consider to be appropriate?
00:40:55.536,00:40:57.580,We've never discussed what's appropriate.
00:40:57.663,00:40:59.540,-Of course we have. -We haven't made decisions.
00:40:59.623,00:41:01.917,There's no procedural rule book for how to talk to these people.
00:41:02.001,00:41:03.627,We spent a month drawing up that questionnaire.
00:41:03.711,00:41:05.754,It is a framework for substantive input.
00:41:08.174,00:41:12.928,"You're so impatient, you weren't in there three minutes with Speck before you got him going with the cunt speak."
00:41:13.012,00:41:15.055,That's when he admitted to raping only one of the women.
00:41:15.139,00:41:17.975,"You want truffles, you gotta get in the dirt with the pigs."
00:41:18.058,00:41:19.310,"No, we don't."
00:41:19.393,00:41:20.769,We are the FBI.
00:41:21.854,00:41:23.063,Look at that board.
00:41:24.899,00:41:26.150,Look at our work.
00:41:27.109,00:41:30.613,"Because of that, Bill and I were able to identify a murderer last week in Georgia."
00:41:30.696,00:41:33.157,This is no longer a theoretical exercise.
00:41:33.240,00:41:37.620,"That board is mostly the result of background research, not priceless gems you seem to think you're mining."
00:41:38.996,00:41:41.499,Everything we do informs the bigger picture.
00:41:41.582,00:41:44.919,"Right, and if our tactics blow back on us, then the whole thing could be jeopardized."
00:41:45.002,00:41:49.840,"We have at least 40 convicts to interview, the data will aggregate-- There is no need to wait that long."
00:41:49.924,00:41:51.258,What happened in that meeting?
00:41:53.385,00:41:56.096,I lied. I outright lied to the OPR.
00:41:56.180,00:41:57.389,What did you say?
00:41:57.473,00:41:59.308,That I erased the Speck tape.
00:41:59.391,00:42:01.810,-You gave them the redacted transcript? -Yes.
00:42:03.229,00:42:07.066,-They don't know about the ripe cunts. -They don't care.
00:42:07.149,00:42:09.109,So we're all in on a little cover-up here.
00:42:09.693,00:42:11.195,I can't be part of a cover-up.
00:42:14.990,00:42:16.617,I don't do deceit very well.
00:42:16.700,00:42:20.162,There is no way they will know about the tape unless we tell them.
00:42:22.248,00:42:24.375,We turn the tape over and be completely transparent.
00:42:24.458,00:42:26.752,"If we're caught in a lie, it'll be very bad."
00:42:26.835,00:42:29.046,-I'm okay with it. -I started this thing.
00:42:34.510,00:42:35.928,-And tell them what? -The truth.
00:42:36.011,00:42:38.097,"Easy for you to say, Wendy, you're a consultant."
00:42:38.180,00:42:44.520,"If they open an investigation, which they will-- Burn the fucking tape."
00:42:45.521,00:42:48.107,They don't give a shit about Speck. Nobody does.
00:42:49.275,00:42:50.609,This can die right here.
00:43:00.369,00:43:02.329,We are not going to turn in the tape.
00:43:02.413,00:43:05.708,We're not going to speak about this anymore. We will protect the unit.
00:43:06.500,00:43:08.127,But something is wrong here.
00:43:09.878,00:43:16.802,"In my entire professional life, I've never been put in a position of having to withhold information from the Bureau, and I resent it."
00:43:18.721,00:43:24.018,"Moving forward, establish clear guidelines for the behavior in these interviews, and you will adhere to them."
00:43:24.935,00:43:30.608,I never want to listen to a tape where I can't tell the difference between my agent and some incarcerated lowlife.
00:02:37.031,00:02:38.116,Got another one.
00:02:40.702,00:02:41.995,Wish you were here.
00:02:45.748,00:02:52.505,"Dear Holden, it's been some time since we've seen each other, and while the memory of your voice has faded, what we discussed has not."
00:02:52.589,00:02:57.260,"I've had more insights into my behavior, which I'd like to share with you at your earliest convenience."
00:02:57.385,00:02:59.220,"Warmest regards, Ed Kemper."
00:02:59.304,00:03:00.638,Ed Kemper writes you?
00:03:06.895,00:03:09.480,"-Bill Tench. -Bill, Detective Chambers."
00:03:09.564,00:03:12.859,"-Hey, Gordon, how's it going down there? -You're not gonna be happy."
00:03:13.401,00:03:14.736,Okay.
00:03:14.819,00:03:16.988,"I had Devier come in, suggested a polygraph."
00:03:19.616,00:03:21.409,-You polygraphed him? -That's right.
00:03:21.534,00:03:22.660,And he passed.
00:03:24.537,00:03:25.997,We don't get that result too often.
00:03:26.080,00:03:28.291,Because it only occurs six percent of the time.
00:03:28.416,00:03:30.835,It usually has to do with how the questions are worded.
00:03:30.919,00:03:32.962,-Lab found Lisa's blood on the rock. -Inconclusive.
00:03:33.046,00:03:35.048,"Devier, he'd cleaned the car."
00:03:37.550,00:03:39.010,"Think that's bad, the inconclusive?"
00:03:39.093,00:03:42.597,"Definitely won't put him away with it. Worst case scenario, he's exonerated."
00:03:42.680,00:03:44.224,-Can you hold a moment? -Sure.
00:03:45.433,00:03:47.101,-You get that? -They've got nothing on him?
00:03:47.227,00:03:48.978,He was happy to take the polygraph.
00:03:54.192,00:03:55.026,Ask him.
00:03:55.109,00:03:57.904,How convinced are we that he's guilty? What percentage convinced?
00:03:57.987,00:03:59.405,-Hundred percent. -I'm about 70.
00:03:59.489,00:04:03.076,It is no accident that this tree trimmer was accused of rape in another county.
00:04:03.159,00:04:04.327,He'd have to be Mirandized.
00:04:04.452,00:04:07.080,It's a death penalty state. There's nothing in it for him.
00:04:07.163,00:04:10.500,He is a narcissist. Might just do it to prove that he can.
00:04:12.543,00:04:15.338,Have Chambers extend an invitation.
00:04:19.842,00:04:21.135,"-Hey, Gordon? -Yeah."
00:04:21.678,00:04:22.762,Here's an idea.
00:04:25.348,00:04:27.016,Can you bring in Devier later?
00:04:27.475,00:04:28.810,Sure. Tonight?
00:04:28.893,00:04:31.688,"6:00, 7:00 p.m. Casual, a little evening chat."
00:04:31.813,00:04:35.149,"Assure him he's not under arrest, but it's important, the FBI wants to talk to him."
00:04:35.566,00:04:37.568,We're doing this after-hours to be more casual?
00:04:37.652,00:04:40.321,"Make it seem that way. He'll be tired, he'll let down his guard."
00:04:40.405,00:04:43.574,Then he'll realize we're working overtime. We mean business.
00:04:45.243,00:04:47.870,"Once he gets to the station, let him wait before we talk to him."
00:04:56.170,00:04:58.673,We need to elicit a physiological response.
00:04:58.756,00:05:00.925,-We need a shoe. -A shoe?
00:05:01.009,00:05:01.843,Ah.
00:05:01.926,00:05:03.636,Something we used to crack another sociopath.
00:05:03.720,00:05:05.888,We need to find the equivalent for Devier.
00:05:19.902,00:05:22.864,"Okay, I need a lot more. Several of these folders, make them thick."
00:05:22.947,00:05:25.533,Go to the copier. Use blank pages if you need to.
00:05:25.658,00:05:27.535,I want it to look like Manhattan Yellow Pages.
00:05:36.169,00:05:38.337,What have we here?
00:05:43.426,00:05:47.138,This is great. This is perfect. Where's her baton? Her twirling baton?
00:05:49.223,00:05:51.434,-She didn't have that on her. -Okay.
00:05:54.062,00:05:56.022,Take all of this to the interview room.
00:05:56.564,00:05:57.440,"Yes, sir."
00:06:00.234,00:06:02.236,"Just on that shelf, the one below."
00:06:09.827,00:06:10.828,"Well, all right."
00:06:13.414,00:06:16.334,-Is there a five and dime around here? -Right off the square.
00:06:16.417,00:06:19.462,"Get a baton, fine if it's cheap. Remove the price tag."
00:06:19.545,00:06:21.005,-Drag it around in the dirt. -Okay.
00:06:21.089,00:06:24.550,I don't want him to see evidence. I want him to see a sweet little girl.
00:06:24.634,00:06:25.593,Hurry.
00:06:30.264,00:06:35.144,"Listen, when we get Devier in here, I'm gonna ask him questions that may make you uncomfortable."
00:06:35.603,00:06:39.273,"Acing the polygraph just lowered his blood pressure, so sit tight, okay?"
00:06:44.112,00:06:45.822,All this an FBI thing?
00:06:46.864,00:06:49.826,"It's, uh... his thing."
00:07:09.262,00:07:10.430,Come right through here.
00:07:25.278,00:07:27.655,So I'm going to have you wait down the hall here.
00:07:27.738,00:07:30.158,Wait while the agents come in. Bring back smokes or anything?
00:07:35.079,00:07:36.873,but I'll help any way I can.
00:07:36.956,00:07:38.875,They just want to talk to you. Through here.
00:07:55.183,00:07:58.060,"Gene, hello. I'm Special Agent Holden Ford."
00:07:59.812,00:08:02.106,"-Hey. -Detective Chambers, you guys have met."
00:08:02.190,00:08:04.317,"Thanks for doing this. You've been Mirandized, right?"
00:08:06.235,00:08:08.154,We're gonna do this as quickly as possible.
00:08:08.696,00:08:10.823,I'm sure you've got better things to do tonight.
00:08:15.620,00:08:18.998,Too regimented. Couldn't stand them barking orders at me all the time.
00:08:25.922,00:08:29.509,"John, my boss, he was great about hiring me, even with the discharge."
00:08:30.051,00:08:33.679,"It seemed like a perfect fit. Out in the weather, working with my hands."
00:08:35.264,00:08:37.433,You can't know that before you go in.
00:08:37.517,00:08:38.559,You went voluntarily?
00:08:38.643,00:08:41.354,"'Nam was pretty much over, figured it'd be low-key."
00:08:41.437,00:08:43.189,Looks like you've married and divorced twice.
00:08:43.272,00:08:45.733,What can I say? I'm popular with the ladies.
00:08:45.816,00:08:48.110,-Or unpopular. -Depending on how you look at it.
00:08:49.695,00:08:51.614,Married my first girl when we were 16.
00:08:51.697,00:08:53.407,Just after you dropped out of high school?
00:08:56.953,00:08:58.871,"School made me a little nuts, too."
00:08:58.955,00:09:00.873,"Wow, so you married your first girl."
00:09:01.707,00:09:04.043,-Why'd you split up? -We were fighting all the time.
00:09:06.254,00:09:08.422,But you're living again with your first ex-wife?
00:09:08.506,00:09:20.977,Yeah. I know. I know. It's kind of-- The bloom of youth has faded.
00:09:23.271,00:09:25.356,You all got a lot of information on me.
00:09:31.153,00:09:32.238,Bureaucracy.
00:09:34.865,00:09:37.910,"Well, listen, I got to mosey out of here soon, so if we could..."
00:09:37.994,00:09:39.412,Of course. Of course.
00:09:39.996,00:09:41.455,Let's get down to business.
00:09:41.539,00:09:43.416,"You're really important to us, Gene."
00:09:45.835,00:09:48.254,You had a bird's-eye view of the entire place.
00:09:48.796,00:09:50.631,"Yeah, but I mean, I didn't see nothing."
00:09:50.715,00:09:53.342,"You know, I was focused on them trees. You got to be."
00:09:53.426,00:09:56.637,"-Especially when you're working the saw. -Understood, but..."
00:09:57.471,00:09:59.640,we're kind of grasping at straws here.
00:10:00.141,00:10:02.310,You're the closest thing we have to an eyewitness.
00:10:03.811,00:10:07.481,"Well, I took your polygraph. I'm an open book."
00:10:10.401,00:10:11.402,So...
00:10:12.486,00:10:14.822,you must have seen Lisa coming and going that week.
00:10:14.905,00:10:15.823,Not really.
00:10:16.365,00:10:18.284,-Maybe once or twice. -Well...
00:10:23.623,00:10:27.710,"Yeah. Oh, yeah, I guess I saw her in that a couple of times."
00:10:27.835,00:10:29.670,"Feathered hat, silver baton?"
00:10:29.754,00:10:31.005,Uh... yeah.
00:10:31.088,00:10:33.215,What time she catch the school bus in the morning?
00:10:33.299,00:10:38.721,"Well, let's see, I'd get there about 7:00, she'd come out maybe half hour later."
00:10:38.846,00:10:41.974,And what time did the bus drop her back off?
00:10:42.433,00:10:43.351,"Oh, I can't say."
00:10:43.434,00:10:47.063,"Um, I mean, maybe 3:30, 4:00."
00:10:47.146,00:10:49.398,Ever see her talk to anyone when she got off the bus?
00:10:49.482,00:10:50.691,"No, sir."
00:10:50.775,00:10:53.402,Anyone on her street who looked like he didn't belong there?
00:10:53.819,00:10:56.405,"Not that I can recall, but, I mean..."
00:10:56.864,00:10:59.450,I wasn't even working the week that she disappeared.
00:10:59.533,00:11:00.493,Right.
00:11:02.370,00:11:03.954,"Oh, hold on, it almost ended."
00:11:09.126,00:11:10.878,That's what she had on her that day.
00:11:16.175,00:11:17.009,Heartbreaking.
00:11:19.053,00:11:23.224,"-By all accounts, she was a sweet kid. -Yeah, she seemed real friendly."
00:11:24.225,00:11:25.101,You noticed that?
00:11:25.559,00:11:28.896,"You know, just saw her playing in the yard with her dog, you know."
00:11:28.979,00:11:34.068,"I mean, I guess you could say she was-- Did you ever talk to her?"
00:11:34.860,00:11:36.737,-No. -She ever talk to you?
00:11:48.541,00:11:50.584,Those girls on the dance team are something else.
00:11:51.919,00:11:53.587,I always had the hots for them.
00:11:54.922,00:11:55.798,I mean...
00:11:58.634,00:12:01.637,"she looks pretty tasty in that outfit, doesn't she?"
00:12:04.473,00:12:06.725,-Sure. -It's very revealing.
00:12:07.726,00:12:08.936,"Yeah, I guess."
00:12:10.604,00:12:11.564,Come on.
00:12:12.356,00:12:13.607,You guys don't think so?
00:12:20.573,00:12:23.409,Okay. Thank you. So it's not just me?
00:12:28.706,00:12:30.708,"Of course, Lisa was in junior high."
00:12:31.167,00:12:33.210,Whoever picked her up might not have known that.
00:12:35.838,00:12:43.721,"I mean, I'm sitting here wracking my brain, trying to remember if I saw someone, but-- She was friendly, probably came up to him."
00:12:43.804,00:12:46.348,"He thought if they got together, it'd be consensual."
00:12:46.557,00:12:50.186,"Well, 14 is the age of consent."
00:12:52.646,00:12:53.522,Yeah.
00:12:54.190,00:12:55.191,Wow.
00:12:57.735,00:13:00.905,I guess Georgia's kind of forward-thinking in that respect.
00:13:01.655,00:13:06.744,"I mean, by the time a woman has hair on her pussy, you'd think she'd be able to decide who gets a piece of it."
00:13:08.871,00:13:17.421,"I mean, yeah, man. I never thought about it like that before, -You ever see that? -No."
00:13:23.844,00:13:26.597,-I tried to get my girlfriend to do it. -You think she would?
00:13:30.518,00:13:32.269,"I told her, Honey, this turns me on."
00:13:32.353,00:13:35.648,"-Just direct like that? -Yeah, I don't know if she's gonna do it."
00:13:36.148,00:13:41.612,"Women have their own minds these days, but it sure would be hot, don't you think?"
00:13:43.030,00:13:44.031,Sure.
00:13:44.114,00:13:46.784,You got to make it with that young pussy before it turns into Mom.
00:13:51.914,00:13:59.046,"She's chatting him up, maybe he's thinking she looks old enough to wear this outfit, twirl a baton, march in the band, probably got some hair on her, but not too much."
00:13:59.838,00:14:00.839,Let's take a break.
00:14:04.635,00:14:07.304,"-No, I'm okay. -Well, I need a break."
00:14:08.931,00:14:11.350,I am gravely concerned with this line of questioning.
00:14:11.433,00:14:13.060,"I told you, you need to relax."
00:14:13.185,00:14:17.940,If it came out in court we suggested the girl flirted with him-- -How would it come out? -He turned off the tape.
00:14:18.023,00:14:19.066,"Yeah, I saw that."
00:14:19.608,00:14:21.235,"I don't know about that, either."
00:14:21.944,00:14:23.320,You agree with this?
00:14:23.445,00:14:25.447,In theory. Not so much in practice.
00:14:26.240,00:14:29.368,I will take full responsibility for what happens in there.
00:14:40.087,00:14:43.299,but the industry term would be a boom lift or a boom truck.
00:14:46.927,00:14:48.679,-In a tree? -That's right.
00:14:48.762,00:14:51.849,"-But you're in a harness, right? -Well, of course, at that height."
00:14:51.932,00:14:56.061,But sometimes you got to get out to get them faraway limbs.
00:14:56.145,00:14:58.856,"-Don't look down, huh? -No, that don't bother me no more."
00:14:58.939,00:15:01.066,You saw Lisa waving to you a couple of times.
00:15:01.150,00:15:03.068,Must not have been too far up to see that.
00:15:03.152,00:15:04.528,"No, I'm not too sure."
00:15:04.612,00:15:06.572,-She ever talk to you? -No.
00:15:09.450,00:15:11.493,Hmm. Okay.
00:15:13.871,00:15:16.206,"We have one person, said she saw the two of you talking."
00:15:21.045,00:15:22.922,"Listen, you're a good-looking guy."
00:15:23.005,00:15:25.466,"Did she just come up to you, being friendly?"
00:15:25.549,00:15:28.677,"She sees you up there every day, sweating away in the hot sun."
00:15:28.761,00:15:30.763,Could she have maybe offered you a soda?
00:15:37.019,00:15:38.020,Can you remember?
00:15:39.688,00:15:41.815,-I guess. -It's coming back to you.
00:15:41.899,00:15:44.568,Just that... she could've talked to me.
00:15:44.652,00:15:45.653,What did she say?
00:15:50.991,00:15:52.117,You weren't listening?
00:15:54.161,00:15:55.621,I can't recall.
00:15:55.704,00:15:57.957,"She ask you about your work, your day, where you live?"
00:15:59.166,00:16:00.501,Something like that.
00:16:02.294,00:16:03.253,Sure.
00:16:03.837,00:16:05.965,I bet she thought you were a handsome cuss.
00:16:07.174,00:16:08.300,I don't know.
00:16:08.384,00:16:09.760,You think she was pretty?
00:16:12.846,00:16:15.265,We've already established she looked at least 14.
00:16:22.147,00:16:24.400,"-That she was cute. -She was precocious, too."
00:16:24.984,00:16:26.902,Didn't mind that you were older.
00:16:27.653,00:16:29.196,She probably kind of liked it.
00:16:30.155,00:16:32.783,Yeah. I kind of thought she was into me.
00:16:32.866,00:16:36.286,"When your job ended and you weren't on that street, you still think about her?"
00:16:38.664,00:16:40.457,see if she wanted to talk some more?
00:16:41.083,00:16:42.960,"I mean, she started things, right?"
00:16:43.043,00:16:44.044,Kind of.
00:16:52.970,00:16:54.346,You ever see her wear this?
00:16:57.224,00:16:58.600,"Here, take a closer look."
00:17:08.902,00:17:11.488,"When you picked her up from the bus, was she wearing this jacket?"
00:17:14.408,00:17:16.243,There was a lot of blood at the crime scene.
00:17:16.326,00:17:19.496,"We haven't revealed too many details, but Lisa's skull was crushed."
00:17:19.621,00:17:21.248,That blood goes everywhere.
00:17:22.041,00:17:28.422,"In crimes involving blunt force trauma, it's almost impossible for the attacker to avoid getting his victim's blood on him."
00:17:28.505,00:17:30.716,The scalp has thousands of capillaries.
00:17:30.799,00:17:33.135,"Blood sprays everywhere, like a fine mist."
00:17:33.218,00:17:35.387,"It gets in your hair, up your nose."
00:17:35.804,00:17:37.931,I'd be amazed if you didn't get any on you.
00:17:42.686,00:17:44.855,-He scrubbed his nails by now. -Is it in your ears?
00:17:44.938,00:17:47.357,I bet. When was the last time you cleaned your ears?
00:17:49.943,00:17:51.528,Yeah. I can arrange that.
00:17:57.701,00:17:58.952,You've gone quiet.
00:18:01.330,00:18:03.082,"if they haven't done it, they won't shut up."
00:18:03.165,00:18:04.166,They protest their innocence.
00:18:07.044,00:18:11.131,"A guilty guy will clam up, start listening intently, which is what you're doing."
00:18:13.842,00:18:16.553,-you can always tell the difference. -Sure can.
00:18:17.513,00:18:19.515,Why do you keep looking at that rock?
00:18:22.768,00:18:25.229,"It's what was used to kill Lisa, wasn't it?"
00:18:25.312,00:18:26.772,When things got out of hand.
00:18:27.981,00:18:29.691,"You didn't mean to, right?"
00:18:29.775,00:18:33.028,"She came up to you, she seemed friendly, and then everything went sideways."
00:18:33.946,00:18:37.282,The question for us isn't Did you do it? We know that you did it.
00:18:37.366,00:18:38.867,The question for us is...
00:18:39.535,00:18:40.494,Why?
00:18:41.537,00:18:44.790,"We think we know why, and we understand."
00:18:47.000,00:18:49.002,All you have to do is tell us if we're right.
00:19:05.602,00:19:08.772,"Bill, why are not we teaching profiling at the Academy?"
00:19:15.154,00:19:17.823,"Now, what I can't get over is the rock."
00:19:17.906,00:19:20.576,He could not control his reaction.
00:19:22.703,00:19:24.496,Something that makes them sweat.
00:19:24.580,00:19:27.499,"Like, for example, my senior year of college."
00:19:27.583,00:19:33.005,"I came home for Christmas, I'm sitting at the kitchen table with my dad, and my mom brings over some eggnog."
00:19:34.256,00:19:40.387,"And she hands me a glass and she says, Holden, have you had sexual relations with a woman?"
00:19:40.470,00:19:41.388,"-Jesus, no. -Yeah."
00:19:45.142,00:19:46.852,"And she says, What's her name?"
00:19:46.935,00:19:50.272,"And I say, Well, actually, Mom, there's been a few."
00:19:55.527,00:19:58.405,"Oh! And then she says, Holden..."
00:20:00.032,00:20:01.950,who's going to have you as a husband now?
00:20:07.831,00:20:09.208,She's your rock.
00:20:09.875,00:20:10.959,Let's be clear.
00:20:11.418,00:20:14.046,All he did was put the killer's murder weapon in front of him.
00:20:14.129,00:20:15.088,"Bill, come on."
00:20:15.214,00:20:19.051,We posited that the killer might feel guilty.
00:20:19.134,00:20:20.552,"And then, I just..."
00:20:21.678,00:20:25.098,created a situation where the guilt completely overwhelmed him.
00:20:26.475,00:20:30.103,"It was the pucker of Oh, shit, I'm going to the electric chair."
00:20:33.899,00:20:37.694,"By interviewing Richard Speck, and Jerry Brudos, and Ed Kemper."
00:20:39.196,00:20:41.240,-You talked to them firsthand? -Uh-huh.
00:20:41.323,00:20:43.450,And we've got Manson and Berkowitz on the wish list.
00:20:46.578,00:20:50.457,"Well, I don't think I'm speaking out of turn here when I say..."
00:20:50.582,00:20:54.086,they are fucked up.
00:20:59.341,00:21:00.592,So what did you say to him?
00:21:04.554,00:21:06.348,-Ugh. -But it was the net effect.
00:21:06.431,00:21:12.145,"I laid out everything she had on her, a portrait of the last day in the life of a 12-year-old girl."
00:21:12.229,00:21:14.564,So you staged it. Like a director.
00:21:15.148,00:21:16.149,I guess.
00:21:18.694,00:21:20.696,That is what made it a nail-biter.
00:21:20.821,00:21:23.198,No one could have scripted the reveal of the rock.
00:21:23.282,00:21:25.617,He completely freaked.
00:21:26.576,00:21:28.453,You could suddenly smell BO in the room.
00:21:28.537,00:21:30.289,-Pavlovian. -Guilt.
00:21:31.164,00:21:34.167,But you were convinced he was guilty before you went in.
00:21:34.835,00:21:36.378,"Well, it was pretty obvious."
00:21:36.503,00:21:38.964,"Yes, but presupposed."
00:21:40.173,00:21:41.925,Correctly presupposed.
00:21:42.009,00:21:45.637,Is it a fair experiment if you're working backward from a conclusion?
00:21:47.639,00:21:51.184,"Holden, you drove him to an emotional response."
00:21:51.310,00:21:53.729,I helped put a child murderer behind bars.
00:21:53.854,00:21:55.063,Like Perry Mason?
00:22:00.193,00:22:02.362,-Please stop analyzing me. -I'm not analyzing you.
00:22:02.446,00:22:04.281,You run this commentary on everything I do.
00:22:04.364,00:22:07.075,"I was talking about your work. That's how we communicate, right?"
00:22:07.159,00:22:09.494,"You talk about your job, I give my opinion."
00:22:09.578,00:22:11.371,Maybe I don't always want your opinion.
00:22:11.455,00:22:14.624,-When I'm not in agreement with you. -Could you just be my girlfriend?
00:22:14.708,00:22:15.876,Could you just listen?
00:22:17.544,00:22:19.504,You mean shut up and adore you?
00:22:19.588,00:22:22.174,"Well, you could try it. Once."
00:22:54.081,00:22:55.707,qualifies as organized.
00:22:56.416,00:22:57.459,We're famous.
00:22:57.918,00:23:00.504,This is apparently the talk of the Atlanta office.
00:23:03.006,00:23:06.468,Darrell Gene Devier cracks under the questioning of a new type of FBI agent.
00:23:10.013,00:23:11.056,Who's named?
00:23:11.515,00:23:13.100,"Read the part about, uh..."
00:23:13.934,00:23:17.896,Behavioral Science's bright-eyed boy who's friends with Ed Kemper.
00:23:17.979,00:23:19.189,Who talked to a reporter?
00:23:21.983,00:23:24.486,That was in confidence to a member of law enforcement.
00:23:24.611,00:23:26.571,-While you were drunk. -Celebrating.
00:23:27.405,00:23:32.035,"Using evidence from the crime scene, he managed to break through Devier's psychological barriers?"
00:23:32.119,00:23:33.578,This reads a lot like coercion.
00:23:33.662,00:23:35.580,"Worse, it sounds like horseshit."
00:23:36.123,00:23:40.418,Devier was in that interrogation room because trees were trimmed on the victim's street.
00:23:43.880,00:23:45.465,We got him to confess.
00:23:45.549,00:23:49.177,-You cannot be proud of this. -There's nothing egregious here.
00:23:51.555,00:23:54.391,Can we all agree we are not ready for Good Morning America?
00:23:54.474,00:23:55.851,I did not give an interview.
00:24:02.107,00:24:03.525,Just because.
00:24:04.151,00:24:05.068,Bill...
00:24:08.405,00:24:12.617,is it possible that you're upset because the article doesn't mention you?
00:24:22.669,00:24:27.007,"Hi, Susan. It's Dr. Wendy Carr. I need to book a flight tomorrow."
00:24:27.090,00:24:29.634,I don't know what to do short of putting a muzzle on him.
00:24:31.219,00:24:33.096,Atlanta. Out of Dulles.
00:24:33.680,00:24:36.474,-The same day if possible. -Why are you going to Atlanta?
00:24:38.685,00:24:41.354,"It's in the article, they're prosecuting a capital case."
00:24:41.438,00:24:44.524,-So? -So we can't be seen to be party to that.
00:24:44.608,00:24:47.235,"I'm sorry. Yes, I am. Can you give me that number again?"
00:24:47.319,00:24:49.362,What? That's none of our concern.
00:24:50.739,00:24:53.241,-He slaughtered a 12-year-old girl. -I know what he did.
00:24:53.325,00:24:55.827,"Oh, uh, window or aisle, both are fine."
00:24:55.911,00:24:59.039,"-Georgia's a death penalty state. -I think I might need a car, too."
00:24:59.122,00:25:00.749,What are you going to say to them?
00:25:01.249,00:25:06.546,We're four interviews in. No one is gonna talk to us if they think we're sending people to the electric chair.
00:25:06.630,00:25:11.218,No one in law enforcement will talk to us if they think we're squeamish about executing rapists and murderers.
00:25:11.301,00:25:14.179,"Oh, that sounds lovely. A convertible or a T-top."
00:25:16.056,00:25:17.599,I don't intend to.
00:25:17.682,00:25:19.559,They won't understand how you're connected to this case.
00:25:19.643,00:25:23.813,"If you don't see how this situation compromises us, I don't know what to say."
00:25:23.897,00:25:26.733,I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm so distracted.
00:25:26.858,00:25:29.069,Can you give me that number one more time?
00:25:29.152,00:25:30.070,Go with her.
00:25:37.327,00:25:38.745,I got it this time. Thank you.
00:25:53.426,00:25:56.554,Follow my lead. I'm used to talking to law enforcement.
00:25:59.975,00:26:03.311,"District Attorney Mayweather, thank you for meeting with us on such short notice."
00:26:03.395,00:26:07.774,"Oh, Esther, please. I am delighted to meet the man who delivered me Gene Devier."
00:26:08.900,00:26:09.943,My pleasure.
00:26:10.443,00:26:17.659,Professor Carr's a consultant at the FBI and she has been instrumental in developing a program-- I'm sorry. I have as long as it takes to finish this sandwich.
00:26:17.742,00:26:22.163,We have been interviewing extremely violent offenders. The worst of the worst.
00:26:22.247,00:26:26.960,This involves establishing an element of trust so that they offer information to us voluntarily.
00:26:27.460,00:26:31.006,We try to be objective because what they have to say is valuable.
00:26:31.464,00:26:37.345,"But if they see that our techniques are being used to eradicate them, then-- Now how would your techniques be used for that?"
00:26:37.887,00:26:44.477,"Agent Ford assembled a psychological sketch of Mr. Devier, based on research, which was used to secure a confession."
00:26:44.602,00:26:50.066,"So if he's convicted and executed, then-- Honey, we don't kill criminals."
00:26:50.692,00:26:52.444,They kill themselves.
00:26:52.819,00:26:53.695,What does that mean?
00:26:53.778,00:26:56.656,It's their behavior that puts them in that chair.
00:26:56.740,00:27:01.119,"Actually, I think it's-- When I talk to a jury, I always ask, Do you watch TV?"
00:27:01.202,00:27:02.370,Most of them do.
00:27:02.454,00:27:04.622,"I say, Who watches the cop shows?"
00:27:05.457,00:27:08.418,Right there you know whether you've got a smart jury or a stupid one.
00:27:08.501,00:27:13.089,"So I say, Forget TV, 'cause it'll never show you the experience of the victim."
00:27:13.173,00:27:17.927,-No. -You will never hear the cries of a woman being raped on The Rockford Files.
00:27:18.470,00:27:26.519,You won't smell burning flesh from the cigarettes being put to her body -on Hawaii Five-O. -I'm not arguing prosecution strategies.
00:27:29.939,00:27:37.489,"My point is that when you go from an abstract idea of murder to the visceral reality, you can no longer be objective."
00:27:37.947,00:27:44.412,Only when you feel the pain of those victims and their loved ones can you know the magnitude of the choice that killer made.
00:27:48.500,00:27:50.752,when we have the wherewithal to lock them up.
00:27:50.835,00:27:56.424,"These people spend the rest of their lives in horrendous conditions, which likely reflect the environments in which they were raised."
00:27:56.508,00:28:02.639,"Maybe-- I'm sorry. But maybe instead of debating the pros and cons of-- Yes, cut to the point."
00:28:03.098,00:28:08.645,Are you actually asking me to shoot lower than capital punishment so it won't reflect poorly on the FBI?
00:28:09.771,00:28:13.691,"Not the FBI, our work in Behavioral Science."
00:28:14.526,00:28:23.118,"If it's compromised, I'm afraid we won't be able to achieve our ultimate goal, which is to hopefully prevent this type of crime from being committed."
00:28:24.703,00:28:29.624,I am asking you to consider life without the possibility of parole.
00:28:35.296,00:28:36.923,I'm an elected official.
00:28:37.465,00:28:40.301,"Here in Georgia, death is the will of the people."
00:28:40.385,00:28:45.265,"And if you don't want to be involved publicly, then maybe you should keep yourselves out of the news."
00:29:08.371,00:29:09.456,What did you expect?
00:29:09.539,00:29:10.874,A reasonable conversation.
00:29:16.629,00:29:18.840,I've spent months of my life and...
00:29:20.800,00:29:25.764,I had hoped that we could complete our research -before seeing it used to this end. -What difference would that make?
00:29:25.847,00:29:28.183,I wouldn't have to be in meetings like the one we had.
00:29:28.266,00:29:29.934,So you could walk away clean?
00:29:30.018,00:29:32.604,"Come on, Wendy. You're smarter than that."
00:29:33.855,00:29:35.064,Evidently not.
00:29:37.650,00:29:40.862,There's no way around the death penalty in death penalty states.
00:29:41.446,00:29:43.865,Which doesn't mean what we're doing is wrong.
00:30:07.013,00:30:08.890,-Hi. -Hi.
00:30:10.475,00:30:11.684,It's so nice out.
00:30:13.186,00:30:14.187,How was your trip?
00:30:14.270,00:30:16.356,Hot. Sticky. Miserable.
00:30:16.439,00:30:17.273,Georgia.
00:30:18.650,00:30:20.568,-Have you eaten? -No.
00:30:20.652,00:30:22.445,Great. You want to get something?
00:30:24.614,00:30:26.199,"It's getting late, we should get going."
00:30:26.282,00:30:27.867,"No, I don't think so."
00:30:29.118,00:30:30.036,Okay.
00:30:36.417,00:30:37.335,Are you still mad?
00:30:38.711,00:30:39.629,Are you...
00:30:40.505,00:30:41.714,What exactly are you?
00:30:41.840,00:30:43.550,Must I be something?
00:30:54.811,00:30:56.062,You were so sweet.
00:30:56.145,00:30:57.272,And curious.
00:30:57.397,00:30:58.523,I'm still...
00:30:59.274,00:31:00.191,curious.
00:31:00.942,00:31:01.901,No.
00:31:02.902,00:31:04.070,You're different.
00:31:04.153,00:31:07.490,I am the exact same person that you reeled in with that jumpsuit.
00:31:07.574,00:31:08.867,I don't think that's true.
00:31:09.742,00:31:11.327,But I'm not the same either.
00:31:12.078,00:31:13.413,Where you going with this?
00:31:13.955,00:31:15.915,"Just... thinking, talking."
00:31:15.999,00:31:17.500,Thinking about...?
00:31:19.335,00:31:21.170,-I don't know. -You don't know?
00:31:21.629,00:31:22.672,I don't know.
00:31:24.883,00:31:26.634,You're so good at reading people...
00:31:27.802,00:31:28.720,you tell me.
00:31:33.766,00:31:34.767,Okay.
00:31:35.643,00:31:36.769,Well...
00:31:37.854,00:31:40.106,"when I first got here, you didn't get up to greet me."
00:31:40.523,00:31:43.860,"And you didn't invite me inside, but you won't come to dinner with me."
00:31:44.485,00:31:48.948,"You've been sitting with your arms crossed, which I know, from you, is a bad sign."
00:31:50.074,00:31:57.999,"You've been in a shitty mood the last ten times we've been together, and you're always starting arguments, and you've been assessing me in a very negative light."
00:31:58.082,00:32:04.088,"And in spite of your recent confusion about your degree, you stay up late every night doing homework, leaving me to go to bed alone."
00:32:06.633,00:32:16.351,"When I got here, you offered a sip of your wine, which could be construed as welcoming, but even though you knew I was coming from the airport, you didn't bring an extra glass, and half the bottle is gone."
00:32:16.809,00:32:21.731,Which means you're trying to take the edge off so that you can...
00:32:25.151,00:32:26.277,break up with me?
00:32:32.367,00:32:33.785,Is that what I'm doing?
00:32:36.621,00:32:39.248,Let's not drag this out. I'll pick up my stuff next week.
00:32:40.416,00:32:43.252,"I'll let you know when, in case you don't want to be here."
00:33:36.723,00:33:38.182,"-Yes, indeed. -You take this?"
00:33:58.578,00:34:02.790,I got a message to call a Dr... Bruxton.
00:34:02.874,00:34:05.376,"-One moment, please. -Did you see who put this here?"
00:34:06.002,00:34:07.462,I just got in myself.
00:34:09.213,00:34:12.925,"Hello, I'm trying to reach a Dr. Bruxton."
00:34:13.051,00:34:15.470,I believe Dr. Bruxton is in surgery.
00:34:15.553,00:34:20.391,Well... I have a message to return his-- One moment.
00:34:29.942,00:34:31.944,Dr. Bruxton isn't available right now.
00:34:32.070,00:34:34.530,"I'm with the FBI, my name is Holden Ford."
00:34:34.655,00:34:36.949,"Oh, yes, he is expecting your call."
00:34:37.825,00:34:39.619,Can you tell me what this is about?
00:34:49.504,00:34:53.257,I don't think so. Edmund Kemper specifically named you as his proxy.
00:34:54.842,00:34:56.969,"At this point, though, he is out of danger."
00:34:57.720,00:34:58.554,Danger?
00:34:58.679,00:35:01.516,Mr. Kemper tried to take his own life last night.
00:35:09.565,00:35:11.859,Mr. Kemper came out of surgery at 4:30 a.m.
00:35:11.943,00:35:13.861,"He's doing well, he's in recovery."
00:35:18.574,00:35:20.326,-Hello? -You need anything from me?
00:35:20.451,00:35:22.578,-The doctor will call if we need anything. -Okay.
00:35:28.292,00:35:34.966,It seems the Office of Professional Responsibility has found continuing evidence for their investigation into our unit.
00:35:35.049,00:35:36.342,Continuing evidence?
00:35:36.467,00:35:37.802,They've got the tape.
00:35:39.137,00:35:41.597,-How the hell'd they get that? -I have no idea.
00:35:43.349,00:35:45.935,But you three have been called to meet with them.
00:35:46.018,00:35:53.901,"And since someone has taken the high road for us, I recommend we all go forward with total transparency."
00:36:05.246,00:36:06.122,Is this you?
00:36:07.832,00:36:09.000,"Fuck you, Bill."
00:36:43.868,00:36:45.870,I work in the Behavioral Science Unit.
00:36:46.621,00:36:50.750,You and Special Agent William Tench recently interviewed an inmate named Richard Speck?
00:36:53.252,00:36:55.379,-Yes. -Which of you recorded the interview?
00:36:55.463,00:36:56.380,I did.
00:36:57.089,00:37:00.009,You and Agent Tench interviewed several inmates over the past few months.
00:37:00.092,00:37:02.136,"-Did you record those, too? -Yes."
00:37:04.388,00:37:05.681,For what purpose?
00:37:05.765,00:37:08.643,"Archival purposes, documentation."
00:37:08.726,00:37:11.062,"-Is this trying, Agent Ford? -I'm sorry?"
00:37:13.564,00:37:14.857,I find it unnecessary.
00:37:16.234,00:37:19.528,What did you do with the recording when you returned to Quantico?
00:37:19.612,00:37:21.906,I gave it to Agent Smith to transcribe it.
00:37:21.989,00:37:24.116,-Did he transcribe it? -Yes.
00:37:24.200,00:37:26.619,-And did you look it over? -Yes.
00:37:26.702,00:37:28.621,Did you then decide it should be redacted?
00:37:28.704,00:37:29.914,Yes.
00:37:31.999,00:37:37.838,I felt there was a section that might be deemed sensitive by other parties.
00:37:37.922,00:37:40.424,Other parties meaning whom?
00:37:40.508,00:37:42.677,Other people at the FBI.
00:37:47.014,00:37:48.140,What section was this?
00:37:48.599,00:37:54.146,The section where I asked Speck why he took eight ripe cunts out of this world.
00:37:54.230,00:37:56.357,You suddenly thought that might not go over well.
00:37:56.440,00:37:57.441,That's right.
00:37:58.693,00:38:01.570,-Did anyone influence your decision? -No.
00:38:01.654,00:38:04.323,"Your partner, Agent Tench. Did he influence your decision?"
00:38:04.407,00:38:06.158,I made the decision on my own.
00:38:06.284,00:38:11.080,What happened once you decided this section was too sensitive to appear in the transcript?
00:38:11.163,00:38:13.165,I asked Agent Smith to take it out.
00:38:13.291,00:38:15.918,-Are you Agent Smith's supervisor? -No.
00:38:16.002,00:38:17.712,Who knew about the redaction at this point?
00:38:17.795,00:38:20.715,"I knew, Agent Smith, and Agent Tench."
00:38:26.595,00:38:28.055,It was my decision.
00:38:29.890,00:38:32.476,Did you ask Agent Smith to lie about erasing the tape?
00:38:32.560,00:38:35.187,-Not in so many words. -What does that mean?
00:38:35.271,00:38:36.772,I looked at him.
00:38:36.897,00:38:38.941,I asked him to lie with my eyes.
00:38:40.526,00:38:44.447,Did the redaction become known to other people in the Behavioral Science Unit?
00:38:49.952,00:38:50.828,I beg your pardon?
00:38:53.664,00:38:56.959,"This is what I do with violent offenders, only much better."
00:38:57.043,00:38:59.920,"Agent Ford, you stand accused of lying to the FBI."
00:39:00.546,00:39:02.214,Do you realize how serious that is?
00:39:02.298,00:39:06.719,You used your badge to gain access to the California Medical Facility without any official approval.
00:39:06.802,00:39:10.181,"To interview our first subject, Kemper, whose feedback launched our program."
00:39:10.264,00:39:13.225,We're not concerned with what you consider your achievements.
00:39:14.560,00:39:19.815,The language used with Richard Speck in the unredacted interview reflects extremely poorly on the Bureau.
00:39:19.940,00:39:21.484,How about calling him a shit stain?
00:39:24.028,00:39:27.198,"-You see what I mean. -Agent, listen to what we're telling you."
00:39:27.656,00:39:31.952,"Flashing your badge is one thing, suppression of evidence is serious."
00:39:32.536,00:39:34.789,You're developing a pattern of behavior that will not sustain you.
00:39:34.914,00:39:41.962,"I just got back from Georgia, where my behavior led to the arrest and confession of a man who raped and murdered a 12-year-old girl."
00:39:42.046,00:39:43.589,Surely my partner told you about that.
00:39:43.672,00:39:46.342,Your partner expressed reservations about the way you handle yourself.
00:39:46.759,00:39:48.219,You're playing us off each other.
00:39:48.302,00:39:51.764,He substantiates our concerns about your comportment as a federal agent.
00:39:52.181,00:39:53.974,We have that on tape.
00:39:54.058,00:39:55.142,Fuck this.
00:39:56.894,00:39:58.813,"If you leave, I can't help you."
00:40:04.318,00:40:05.945,You're making a terrible mistake.
00:40:20.292,00:40:21.502,"What'd you tell them, Bill?"
00:40:23.212,00:40:24.505,I told them the truth.
00:41:37.578,00:41:38.496,Thank you.
00:41:59.934,00:42:01.185,Edmund Kemper?
00:42:05.898,00:42:06.899,Thank you.
00:42:37.972,00:42:38.973,You came.
00:42:39.640,00:42:41.350,You made it hard not to.
00:42:41.433,00:42:44.228,"Well, I tried less dramatic methods."
00:42:44.311,00:42:46.730,-Did you get my cards? -Yes.
00:42:48.440,00:42:51.860,Maybe it's not surprising you respond to showmanship.
00:42:52.987,00:42:55.573,"Why do you want to see me, Ed?"
00:42:57.533,00:42:59.451,I read an article about you.
00:43:02.413,00:43:04.498,The Atlanta Constitution?
00:43:04.582,00:43:06.792,The story was picked up by the AP.
00:43:08.002,00:43:11.463,-Oh. -You said we were friends.
00:43:16.135,00:43:18.304,"-Yes. -Are we friends, Holden?"
00:43:19.013,00:43:22.766,"In the context of our work together, sure."
00:43:22.850,00:43:24.268,Our work together.
00:43:24.893,00:43:28.689,That's a nice way of putting it. I'd categorize it the same way.
00:43:30.774,00:43:33.110,"And yet, our work is unfinished."
00:43:33.611,00:43:36.322,-Okay. -As I indicated in my letters.
00:43:37.031,00:43:38.449,You have more...
00:43:40.034,00:43:41.285,insights?
00:43:41.368,00:43:42.202,I do.
00:43:53.839,00:43:55.382,That story was not...
00:43:58.302,00:44:01.513,I... had had a bit to drink.
00:44:02.348,00:44:05.643,What's this behavioral profiling you're touting?
00:44:06.935,00:44:07.936,Well...
00:44:19.490,00:44:21.075,I love that.
00:44:23.327,00:44:25.412,What's my psychology?
00:44:25.496,00:44:27.498,I can't really tell you that.
00:44:27.581,00:44:29.416,You can't or you won't?
00:44:29.500,00:44:32.878,"-It's shoptalk, Ed. -My favorite."
00:44:33.754,00:44:35.631,We're at an early point in the research.
00:44:35.714,00:44:39.301,Not so early that you can't babble about it in the press.
00:44:39.385,00:44:42.971,And you pretty much admit that I started you down this path.
00:44:43.055,00:44:47.685,"So... I believe you owe me an explanation, Holden."
00:44:51.647,00:44:54.233,You're what we'd call an organized killer.
00:44:54.316,00:44:55.442,Mm-hmm.
00:44:56.026,00:44:58.821,Because of the extreme planning that went into your crimes.
00:45:00.072,00:45:04.159,You practiced picking up women several times before selecting your first victim.
00:45:04.284,00:45:07.871,You used your own vehicle both in the kidnapping and disposing of the bodies.
00:45:08.664,00:45:13.794,"You followed your crimes in the media, which shows evidence of continued fantasy."
00:45:18.590,00:45:19.800,That's the gist.
00:45:20.300,00:45:23.512,You think you can boil me down to a single adjective?
00:45:23.595,00:45:27.975,Of course not. It's merely a way to sort characteristics.
00:45:28.058,00:45:30.060,-You're an expert now. -No.
00:45:30.644,00:45:33.522,-Sounds like it. -I am not an expert.
00:45:34.022,00:45:36.108,"But you want to be, don't you?"
00:45:42.156,00:45:43.365,Yes.
00:45:50.581,00:45:53.125,Human blood is very hot.
00:45:53.625,00:45:57.129,"On a cold, humid morning you can see it steam."
00:45:57.212,00:45:59.047,"What are you doing, Ed?"
00:45:59.131,00:46:01.925,Someone left a ballpoint pen on my court file.
00:46:02.009,00:46:03.927,I used the metal casing.
00:46:07.097,00:46:08.849,Is this what you wanted to see?
00:46:10.225,00:46:11.935,Why would I want to see that?
00:46:14.354,00:46:16.064,Take a closer look.
00:46:22.070,00:46:23.947,That's okay. Really.
00:46:28.494,00:46:31.622,"You know, women were initially indifferent to me."
00:46:32.956,00:46:35.209,They weren't interested in sharing.
00:46:37.002,00:46:40.005,"My whole life, no one wanted to interact with me."
00:46:40.088,00:46:42.966,"Not even our cats, when I was a kid."
00:46:55.270,00:47:00.150,"The only way I could have those girls was to kill them, and it worked."
00:47:07.908,00:47:13.038,"Funny thing in the ICU, there's no system to alert the guards."
00:47:13.914,00:47:17.709,"It's short-sighted, seeing what kind of people come through."
00:47:19.419,00:47:22.047,"I could kill you now, pretty easily."
00:47:23.131,00:47:26.510,Do some interesting things before anyone showed up.
00:47:28.470,00:47:30.597,Then you'd be with me in spirit.
00:47:33.517,00:47:40.399,"I invited you many times to visit, but even with this, I never thought you'd actually come."
00:47:42.067,00:47:44.069,"Why are you here, Holden?"
00:47:47.239,00:47:48.240,I don't know.
00:47:51.952,00:47:53.412,"Well, now..."
00:47:54.830,00:47:56.415,that is the truth.
00:48:24.526,00:48:27.487,-Are you all right? -I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
00:48:27.571,00:48:29.197,-Did you take anything? -I don't know.
00:48:29.281,00:48:31.408,-Do you have any allergies? -I don't know.
00:48:32.326,00:48:33.535,I'm dying.
00:48:36.872,00:48:38.874,your attitude is gonna bite you in the ass.
00:48:50.802,00:48:53.597,"That is your world, and it has made you paranoid."
