Came back to town,
just like I told you he would.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Benji was home watching TV
the night Beverly Jean was killed?

7
00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what he told us and I believe him.

8
00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:28.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He let us search his car, no warrant.

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we didn't find a thing
except for some of Beverly Jean's hair,

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

11
00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:37.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Passenger seat's not the best way
to transport a corpse, I'll give you that.

12
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you said he was home alone
watching TV?

13
00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's not much of an alibi.
-Why?

14
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Isn't that what most people do
most nights of the week?

15
00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:48.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

16
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

18
00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Works at the A&amp;P? Does he have access
to a delivery vehicle?

19
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:56.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nope. Only works the floor.

20
00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

21
00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's in mourning,
I thought it'd be polite to let him know.

22
00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should've brought a six pack.

25
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:48.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got some donuts, too.
Half glazed, half cake.

29
00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd love a donut. Thanks, Benjamin.

30
00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:55.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks for meeting with us,

32
00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm Bill Tench, this is Holden Ford.
We're with the FBI.

33
00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He told me you'll be helping
with the case.

34
00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're sorry about your girlfriend.

35
00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[tearful] I still can't believe it.

36
00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Holden] How long were you with her?

37
00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So this was pretty serious.

38
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We just got engaged.

39
00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:12.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] Big step.

40
00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:17.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I knew she was it when I met her.
-How'd you know?

41
00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, we saw things the same way.

42
00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Holden] And you're how old?

43
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You play sports in high school?
I'm guessing not the football team.

44
00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Band? Debate?

45
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then what did you do?

46
00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, I... nothing.

47
00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you're doing good now.
Got your own place and everything.

48
00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got this place for Beverly Jean.

49
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] She ask you to move?

50
00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanted us to have some privacy.

51
00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where were you before?

52

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-With your family?

54
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It must have been hard on her,
seeing you leave home.

55
00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think she was happy to see me move on.

56
00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:07.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She loved Beverly Jean as much as I did.

58
00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you two know each other from church?

59
00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

60
00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:18.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mostly by sight now.

61
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

62
00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

63
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Yeah. She crack the whip?

64
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh...

65
00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:30.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

66
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I'm sure it was difficult
raising two kids without a dad.

67
00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, he split when I was ten.

68
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What was your father like?
-I don't much remember him.

69
00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You and Beverly Jean ever fight?

70
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perfectly normal for a young couple.

71
00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sometimes.

72
00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:49.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] What'd you fight about?

73
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just stupid stuff.

74
00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

75
00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like, uh...

78
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You got this place for her?
Did she like it?

79
00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

80
00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:13.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She wanted to make it pretty
when she moved in.

81
00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] When was that gonna be?

83
00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:19.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Holden] Was that for your mother?

84
00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was just to keep it proper.

85
00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was she saving herself for marriage?

86
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, maybe she didn't want to wait.

87
00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Girls like fooling around
just as much as boys.

88
00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's okay, Benjamin.

89
00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:37.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We understand, that's...

90
00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's private.

91
00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll keep it private.

95
00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your first sexual experience?

96
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:54.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

97
00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:57.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But she was nice.

98
00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know what all this has to do
with what happened to her--

99
00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen, Benjamin.
We're from a particular unit of the FBI.

100
00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:09.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

104
00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does he know?

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mark, seriously?

106
00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:30.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He only knows about the breasts.
It was another officer--

107
00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.121 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's hard keeping this quiet.
-I want to talk to Mrs. Barnwright.

108
00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Should we stop at a pay phone,
give her a heads up, too?

109
00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That'd be fair.
-[Holden] What about the tears?

110
00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I didn't buy them.
-Think he was faking?

111
00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:43.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Tench] Seemed a bit much.
-[Mark] Given what he's been through?

112
00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:46.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It sure got us out of there.
-He's obviously a mama's boy.

113
00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or he knows how to play one.

114
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean?

115
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was a virgin? He serves donuts?

116
00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:57.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All of that could have been rehearsed,
especially since he knew we were coming.

117
00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:02.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Benjamin has never seemed
like a performer to me.

118
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Two Feds in your living room
would make anybody nervous.

119
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at him, you think
he could have easily moved a body?

120
00:08:08.362 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not without bursting into tears.

121
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

122
00:08:15.786 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[woman]<i> I always worried about Benjamin.</i>

123
00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:20.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench]<i> He was living with you</i>
<i>when he met Beverly Jean?</i>

124
00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:25.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He was so excited to have a girlfriend.
-Did she reciprocate those feelings?

125
00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He said that she was crazy about him.

126
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you meet her?
-Of course.

127
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:32.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What were they like together?

128
00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, they were... normal.

129
00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She teased him a lot. He pretended
not to enjoy it, but I know he did.

130
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Benjamin told us
the two of them argued sometimes.

131
00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you see him?

132
00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:48.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This morning.

133
00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he in trouble?

134
00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:57.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're just going over the case again,
talking to everyone who knew Beverly Jean.

135
00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:01.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well... I never heard them argue.

136
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Benjamin is soft, you know.

137
00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:07.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was he like as a kid?

138
00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:12.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was always sensitive.
But when his father ran off, he just...

139
00:09:15.012 --> 00:09:16.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] What do you mean?

140
00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well...

141
00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he started to cry a lot, wet the bed.

142
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He wouldn't leave the house.
-[Holden] That must have been difficult.

143
00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had to leave the kids
on their own a lot.

144
00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:31.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rose helped out,
but she was just so little.

145
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Those were hard years.
I did a lot of praying.

146
00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:41.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then Rose met Frank
and he moved in with us.

147
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frank Janderman.

148
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[woman] That's right.

149
00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:47.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They just had a baby, you know.

150
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your first grandchild?

151
00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:50.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Congratulations.

152
00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:56.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
People talked about Frank back then,
but I never listened to all that.

153
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I loved him from the first time I met him.
I still do.

154
00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:01.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did Benjamin feel the same way?

155
00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, he started to go out, you know.

156
00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:06.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He became friends with Frank.

157
00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:08.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frank protected him.

158
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He wouldn't let anyone near Rose.

159
00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:16.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He even got Benji a job
so I didn't have to work two shifts.

160
00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes Rose said
I loved him more than she did.

161
00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When was this?

162
00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:29.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, uh... they got married at 18,

163
00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:32.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so Rose must have been...

164
00:10:34.508 --> 00:10:36.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
15, 16 at the time.

165
00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:38.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frank moved in. Why?

166
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I don't remember.

167
00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:46.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He had some problems at home
with his father, as young boys do.

168
00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But he got them their own place
when they married.

169
00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Benjamin lived at home with you
until he met Beverly Jean?

170
00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's been a strange time.

171
00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:01.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We were so happy that Rose and Frank
were having a baby,

172
00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:06.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then Benjamin loses his love
in such a horrible way. [sobs]

173
00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like mother, like son.

174
00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think there's a gene for crying?

175
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I keep wondering why Beverly was
with him in the first place.

176
00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:24.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She might have liked that he was older,
easy to talk to. He's sensitive.

177
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Half glazed, half cake"?

178
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:27.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

179
00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:33.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bet Beverly had poor old pipsqueak Benji
wrapped around her golden triangle.

180
00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:37.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe she wanted a nice guy
with a steady income who loved her.

181
00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whatever you say, Ocasek.

182
00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:40.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's that?

183
00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were just saying there's not much here.

184
00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:45.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I assured Mrs. Barnwright
this was a formality.

185
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not a formality.
-Well, I can tell her it is.

186
00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So where does this leave us?

187
00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:53.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's still Alvin.

188
00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:56.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't want it to be someone
in the community. Neither of you do.

189
00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who drives all this way
to come to some rust belt town?

190
00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:02.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're hunting for girls,
you got big cities.

191
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:04.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You got freeways with hitchhikers.

192
00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:06.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why choose a place like this?

193
00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How would a drifter
know where the dump is?

194
00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hi.
-There you are.

195
00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:21.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got all kinds of fun things
for you to look over.

196
00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:22.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh. Paperwork?

197
00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:26.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it's hardly sexy, but I'm trying
to put together a list of questions

198
00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for the killers that you interview.

199
00:12:27.538 --> 00:12:30.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Things like family history, mood,

200
00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:32.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
thought patterns before, during,
and after the crime.

201
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:36.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is just a first draft, but look it
over and let me know what you think.

202
00:12:36.338 --> 00:12:38.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shouldn't we tailor the interviews
based on the killer's personality?

203
00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:40.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mean just wing it?

204
00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With these guys,
we need to look for different ways in.

205
00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:46.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, but we still need a data set
that's consistent across all our subjects.

206
00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:48.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You leaving?

207
00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:50.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Back to Boston.
-You just got here.

208
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, until you conduct more interviews,
there's really nothing for me to do here.

209
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We had a really interesting conversation

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

315
00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ocasek looked into Frank Janderman.

316
00:18:26.146 --> 00:18:29.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apparently, in high school,
he was sent to a psychiatric hospital

317
00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:31.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for taking a monkey wrench to a girl.

318
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Frank Janderman?
-Rose's husband.

319
00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:38.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should get this on tape.

320
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:45.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I got to thinking,
why did Mrs. Barnwright

321
00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:47.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
say people were talking
about Frank back then?

322
00:18:47.876 --> 00:18:49.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What were they talking about, right?
-Right.

323
00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:52.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I talked to this family court judge
who's a friend of mine.

324
00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:54.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure enough, he remembers the case.

325
00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:56.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Since Frank was a juvenile
when the assault occurred,

326
00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:57.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the court sealed the records.

327
00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:00.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fortunately, the judge
is a very good friend of mine.

328
00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:02.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here's what we've got on Frank's hearing,

329
00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:05.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and his time at Warren State.

330
00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:07.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice work, Mark.

331
00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:10.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is where your community system
pays off.

332
00:19:10.357 --> 00:19:12.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's been here since nine.
Maybe we should--

333
00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:13.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let him wait.

334
00:19:15.195 --> 00:19:16.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why don't we have a cup of coffee?

335
00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:19.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If Frank's a hothead,
it'll irritate him, throw him off.

336
00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:23.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Class of '71?

337
00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:26.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yep.
-You go to your five-year reunion?

338
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:29.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't really keep up with that stuff.

339
00:19:30.043 --> 00:19:33.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's commendable that you graduated,
seeing as how you missed your junior year.

340
00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:35.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you want from me?
I've been here all day.

341
00:19:35.632 --> 00:19:38.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I answered all your questions last week.
-We just have a few more.

342
00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:42.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got everyone in a tizzy.

343
00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:44.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You mean Benjamin?
-Yeah.

344
00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:48.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole family. Me, my wife, mom.
You scared the shit out of Benji.

345
00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:51.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] I'm sorry if we scared everyone.

346
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And for keeping you for so long.

347
00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:55.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beverly Jean Shaw was close
with your family.

348
00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're simply looking
for a little background.

349
00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:58.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She wasn't that close.

350
00:19:59.948 --> 00:20:01.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was about to marry
your brother-in-law.

351
00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:02.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They hadn't set a date.

352
00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:06.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I didn't spend a lot of time with him.
-You and Benjamin aren't close?

353
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's this "close" shit?
That's like women.

354
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mrs. Barnwright said
you looked out for him.

355
00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:16.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, yeah, he's a shrimp.
-And he's your brother-in-law.

356
00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep.

357
00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:21.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So you would help him if he needed it.
-Yep.

358
00:20:24.097 --> 00:20:25.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you fight a lot in high school?

359
00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:27.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like Popeye.

360
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:33.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How'd you land yourself
in Warren State Psychiatric Hospital?

361
00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's probably in your fucking file.

362
00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:40.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want to hear your side.

363
00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:43.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

364
00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:46.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This girl freaked out on me,
came after me with a wrench.

365
00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:49.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I tried to get it,
it swang back, hit her in the face.

366
00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:51.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then all this shit
came raining down on me.

367
00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:53.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why'd she freak out?

368
00:20:53.877 --> 00:20:57.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I was seeing some other girl, too.
-You a ladies man?

369
00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:58.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe. Back then.

370
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They sent you to a mental institution.
-That was bullshit.

371
00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:05.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I had to go, it was part of the plea.
-You did a plea deal?

372
00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:07.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why not go to court,
tell them what you told us?

373
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:10.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My lawyer said I'd never win
against a sweet girl with a broken nose.

374
00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:15.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There were other infractions, I was
running around like a jackass back then.

375
00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:18.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But no longer?
-I'm married now. Got a kid.

376
00:21:19.152 --> 00:21:21.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Marriage and fatherhood
don't make anger go away.

377
00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:24.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wasn't angry, I was just...

378
00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:25.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Misunderstood?

379
00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:29.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Makes me sound like a pussy, but yeah.

380
00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:33.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Want to tell us about the night
Beverly Jean disappeared?

381
00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:35.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs heavily]

382
00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:39.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know. It was, uh...
typical, I guess.

383
00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:41.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rose was still pregnant back then.

384
00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:44.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got her some dinner and watched TV.

385
00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:46.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So you were home all night.
-No.

386
00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:47.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No?

387
00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:51.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. I told you,
I went out and got us dinner.

388
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long were you gone?

389
00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:55.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know, 15, 20 minutes maybe.

390
00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:57.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where'd you get food?

391
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:59.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rose likes the rolls at Hannah's Diner
on Market Street.

392
00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:01.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And Rose will confirm this?

393
00:22:02.904 --> 00:22:05.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Am I under some kind of suspicion here?

394
00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:08.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're just looking at it from every angle.

395
00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:13.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, Beverly Jean was, uh...
was Benji's girl.

396
00:22:13.373 --> 00:22:14.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I barely knew her.

397
00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:17.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Strange, seeing as how she was
about to be part of the family.

398
00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:19.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:21.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop saying it like that.

400
00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:23.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You said they hadn't set a date
for the wedding.

401
00:22:24.384 --> 00:22:27.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It was loose.
-They were engaged, weren't they?

402
00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:28.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

403
00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Benji thought they were.

404
00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:37.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The impression I got is that she was
in love with him, wanted to marry him.

405
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:40.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, man, I don't want to rain
on his parade--

406
00:22:40.275 --> 00:22:42.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're saying he made the relationship
more than what it was?

407
00:22:42.652 --> 00:22:44.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She let him call her his girlfriend.

408
00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:46.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He got that apartment for her.

409
00:22:46.281 --> 00:22:48.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, that was the big plan,
get her to move in.

410
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Was Beverly even sleeping with him?
-Now and again.

411
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A looker like her, he thought he'd died
and gone to heaven.

412
00:22:54.664 --> 00:22:57.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You found her attractive?
-She's a seven.

413
00:22:57.876 --> 00:23:00.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? From the photos,
I'd give her an eight.

414
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In Altoona, she's a solid eight.

415
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought Benji had done
pretty good for himself.

416
00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

417
00:23:09.513 --> 00:23:10.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so quick to cry.

418
00:23:11.515 --> 00:23:12.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shit, yeah.

419
00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:15.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you think that he was satisfying her?

420
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:19.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

421
00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:22.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't think he was blowing her mind.
-She tell you that?

422
00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:25.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not in so many words, but when a chick's
enjoying it, she's all over you.

423
00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:27.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think Beverly Jean
knew the difference?

424
00:23:28.448 --> 00:23:31.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think she'd, you know...
been around?

425
00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:36.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd say she was, uh... open.

426
00:23:39.543 --> 00:23:40.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Benjamin see it that way too?

427
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:44.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know if he didn't get it
or he didn't want to.

428
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone we interviewed
said Beverly Jean was...

429
00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
nice, loyal, decent.

430
00:24:00.397 --> 00:24:01.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well...

431
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:06.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
no one's gonna come right out
and say the dead girl was easy.

432
00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:09.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frank's cagey. You hear him deflect
on that deal in high school?

433
00:24:10.198 --> 00:24:12.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He could have made that up
about her being a slut.

434
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:12.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if he didn't?

435
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:16.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen, if Beverly had the upper hand
in the relationship

436
00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:19.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and made Benjamin feel jealous
by seeing other men,

437
00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:23.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if Benjamin felt sexually powerless,

438
00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:25.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he might lash out with the kind of anger
we see in this crime.

439
00:24:26.506 --> 00:24:28.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see what Benjamin has to say.

440
00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:30.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bring him in?
-Yeah.

441
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You understand you're not under arrest?

442
00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:35.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're free to leave at any point,
only have to talk to us if you want to.

443
00:24:36.016 --> 00:24:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you're okay with us
recording this conversation?

444
00:24:38.643 --> 00:24:40.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just so much easier
than writing everything down.

445
00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:42.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I want to help if I can.

446
00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:47.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know a lot about this case
you're not telling us, don't you?

447
00:24:47.485 --> 00:24:50.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, no,
nothing more than what I already said.

448
00:24:50.739 --> 00:24:51.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We talked to Frank.

449
00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:54.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He paints a different picture
of your relationship with Beverly.

450
00:24:54.701 --> 00:24:57.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said you made up that part
about you and her being engaged.

451
00:24:58.496 --> 00:24:59.873 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh...

452
00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:01.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I didn't have a ring yet,

453
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:05.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but, um, but I asked her and she said yes.

454
00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:07.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It sounded like she wanted
to keep her options open.

455
00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:12.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] Benjamin?

456
00:25:15.222 --> 00:25:16.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did Frank say that?

457
00:25:16.806 --> 00:25:18.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] He said a lot of things.

458
00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:22.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-'Cause he was jealous.
-[Holden] Jealous?

459
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would he be jealous?

460
00:25:24.147 --> 00:25:26.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's married. To your sister.

461
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:27.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well...

462
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was always asking when...
she was coming around,

463
00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
always talking to her
like she was his girlfriend.

464
00:25:35.283 --> 00:25:37.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What do you mean?
-Like "Hey, hon,"

465
00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:41.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Hey, babe,"
"Hey, sweetheart, go get me a beer."

466
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And...

467
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he was always getting her
to sit on his lap.

468
00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:51.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did she want to sit on his lap?
-She had to or it would've been rude.

469
00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:55.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did he try to have sex with her?
-No, it didn't go that far.

470
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] He told us he was interested.

471
00:25:57.055 --> 00:26:00.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beverly Jean was a beautiful woman.
She wouldn't do that.

472
00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:03.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do what, have sex? She had sex with you.
-She loved me.

473
00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:05.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But she wasn't exactly
saving herself for marriage.

474
00:26:06.022 --> 00:26:08.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Benjamin sobbing]

475
00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:10.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you think you satisfied her, Benjamin?

476
00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:12.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[bell rings]

477
00:26:24.708 --> 00:26:26.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you see her that night
when she got off work?

478
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I was home, I was watching television.

479
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Didn't you want her to come over,
hang out with you?

480
00:26:31.548 --> 00:26:34.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course I wanted her to come over,
because I loved her.

481
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sobbing] Now she's dead.

482
00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:41.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God!

483
00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:43.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God!

484
00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:48.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[soft music plays]
-[indistinct chatter]

485
00:26:53.737 --> 00:26:55.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So did Beverly Jean sleep around?

486
00:26:58.074 --> 00:27:00.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Alvin tried to pick her up at a bar.
-She turned him down.

487
00:27:01.077 --> 00:27:02.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] What was she doing at a bar?

488
00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:05.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Having a drink?
-Was she alone, with a girlfriend?

489
00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:07.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What would that tell us?

490
00:27:07.417 --> 00:27:09.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A single woman in a bar...

491
00:27:09.252 --> 00:27:11.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A single woman might go alone
just to have a drink.

492
00:27:11.546 --> 00:27:14.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What about her?
Is she trying to pick someone up?

493
00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:17.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, probably.
-Why, because she's by herself?

494
00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:19.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because she's at a bar?

495
00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:21.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-That's an assumption.

496
00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:24.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Say she is looking for someone,
does that make her easy?

497
00:27:24.934 --> 00:27:26.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is she looking for a husband
or a one-night stand?

498
00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:28.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does the difference
change your perception?

499
00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:30.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sure.
-Why?

500
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:34.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, changes whether
I'd be interested in her, theoretically.

501
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:37.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What if you're looking
for a one-night stand... theoretically?

502
00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:40.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I don't-- It's not my thing.

503
00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:41.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Come on, Mark.
-[Tench] Leave him alone.

504
00:27:42.077 --> 00:27:46.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beverly's sexual history is only important
because if she was seeing other men,

505
00:27:46.247 --> 00:27:47.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then obviously they're suspects.

506
00:27:47.957 --> 00:27:49.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So who else can we talk to?

507
00:27:52.545 --> 00:27:56.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a couple of friends
we could question... again.

508
00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:58.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyone else she might have confided in?

509
00:27:58.885 --> 00:28:01.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She did just get her hair done. Right?

510
00:28:03.973 --> 00:28:05.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here's a question,

511
00:28:05.266 --> 00:28:07.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if it is Benjamin or some other boyfriend
who freaked out on her,

512
00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:09.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
does the case merit our involvement?

513
00:28:11.147 --> 00:28:14.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We still can't rule out a sequence killer,
but if the perpetrator was a townie,

514
00:28:14.734 --> 00:28:17.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then the crime is random, and there's
no expectation that he'll be repeating it.

515
00:28:17.737 --> 00:28:21.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Here's my question, shouldn't our funding
cover separate rooms?

516
00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:22.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't like my company?

517
00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:24.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll get connecting doors.

518
00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:45.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The mutilation of her body alone
justifies our involvement.

519
00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:51.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you mind sitting
on your own bed, please?

520
00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:19.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that was a dead end.

521
00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:21.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's next?

522
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:23.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One of the families she baby-sat for,

523
00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:28.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You mind if we take a quick detour?
Something's been bugging me.

524
00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:29.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] Okay.

525
00:29:52.665 --> 00:29:53.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi, Rose.

526
00:29:58.046 --> 00:29:59.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just got him to sleep.

527
00:29:59.422 --> 00:30:01.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pretty hard having a newborn.

528
00:30:01.257 --> 00:30:03.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All anybody ever tells you
is how great it is.

529
00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:07.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But my wife and I, with both our kids,
we walked around like zombies

530
00:30:07.222 --> 00:30:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for the first three months.

531
00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:12.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, Trinity Lutheran,
over on Sycamore,

532
00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:14.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
has a program for single moms.

533
00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:16.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not that you're single,
but it's your first child

534
00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:20.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they'll have all kinds of information
on feeding him, getting him to sleep.

535
00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:22.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks.
-What about Frank?

536
00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:24.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He help you out?
-[Rose] When he can.

537
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:25.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's got work.

538
00:30:26.032 --> 00:30:28.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your mom certainly seems excited
about having a grandbaby.

539
00:30:28.701 --> 00:30:29.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rose] She is happy.

540
00:30:30.453 --> 00:30:32.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And Benjamin, is he helping?

541
00:30:33.248 --> 00:30:36.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[scoffs] No.
-You close with Benjamin?

542
00:30:36.793 --> 00:30:38.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's my older brother.

543
00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:40.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] By how much?

544
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:42.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fourteen months.

545
00:30:42.298 --> 00:30:44.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have good memories growing up?

546
00:30:44.551 --> 00:30:46.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom went to work. Got two jobs.

547
00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:49.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two kids, two jobs. How'd she swing that?

548
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Me and Benji went to school
a couple blocks over.

549
00:30:51.558 --> 00:30:53.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We would walk home in the afternoon.

550
00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:56.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And you were how old?
-Ten. Maybe eleven.

551
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:57.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's pretty young.

552
00:30:58.064 --> 00:31:01.484 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mom would come home tired,
wasn't really up for dealing with kids.

553
00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'd make sure the house was clean.
-It's no small feat.

554
00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:10.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How old were you when you met Frank?
-Sixteen.

555
00:31:11.452 --> 00:31:13.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know about the incident with Frank
in high school?

556
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:18.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was before I met him.

557
00:31:19.294 --> 00:31:23.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Tench] You ever talk with him about it?
-[Rose] He told me it was some accident.

558
00:31:24.924 --> 00:31:25.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rose...

559
00:31:27.093 --> 00:31:28.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you knew Beverly Jean.

560
00:31:30.179 --> 00:31:31.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was she like?

561
00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:33.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was really sweet.

562
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] You think she
was good for Benjamin?

563
00:31:36.185 --> 00:31:37.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She made him want to leave home.

564
00:31:38.938 --> 00:31:40.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought that was good.

565
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We gave him money for a security deposit.
Signed his lease.

566
00:31:45.361 --> 00:31:46.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did she intend to marry him?

567
00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:50.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was working on her.

568
00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:53.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was she... seeing other men?

569
00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:59.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Benjamin thought she might be.

570
00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:00.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Benjamin told you this?

571
00:32:03.129 --> 00:32:06.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said he thought
she was giving him the runaround.

572
00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:09.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Getting done up for other guys.

573
00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:11.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Done up how?

574
00:32:11.137 --> 00:32:12.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dressing provocatively?

575
00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Painting her nails? Wearing perfume?

576
00:32:15.683 --> 00:32:16.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Getting her hair done.

577
00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:21.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] Frank told us he was with you
the night Beverly Jean was murdered.

578
00:32:21.814 --> 00:32:23.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that true?
-Yes.

579
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, uh...

580
00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:30.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he went out to get us food.

581
00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:34.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How long was he gone?
-[baby cries]

582
00:32:49.842 --> 00:32:53.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[baby cooing]

583
00:32:54.931 --> 00:32:56.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rose, if you are hiding something

584
00:32:57.725 --> 00:33:00.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they find out about it,
it will not be good for you...

585
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or for him.

586
00:33:04.065 --> 00:33:07.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[baby cries]

587
00:33:24.544 --> 00:33:25.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are we missing?

588
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you see those bruises on her arm?
-[Tench] Yeah.

589
00:33:32.218 --> 00:33:33.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think Frank did that?

590
00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:36.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Her mother told us that he wouldn't let
anyone else get close to her.

591
00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should we search Frank's car?

592
00:33:40.476 --> 00:33:42.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I would need a warrant.
-[Tench] Let's get one.

593
00:33:45.064 --> 00:33:48.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mark. There's a young woman downstairs
asking for you.

594
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi, Rose.

595
00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:07.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[stammers] Do--
[clears throat]

596
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:14.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[whispers] Do you promise my baby will
be okay if I tell you what happened?

597
00:34:15.136 --> 00:34:16.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

598
00:34:20.975 --> 00:34:21.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's okay.

599
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's okay. Hey.
-[sobs]

600
00:34:33.946 --> 00:34:37.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you said Frank was not home
the night Beverly Jean disappeared?

601
00:34:40.453 --> 00:34:41.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

602
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know where he was?

603
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:46.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

604
00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:49.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where was he?

605
00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:53.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Benji called us that night
and asked Frank to come over.

606
00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:57.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

607
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So Frank left.

608
00:35:00.848 --> 00:35:02.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long was he gone?

609
00:35:06.646 --> 00:35:09.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He called after two or three hours.
Asked me to come over there too.

610
00:35:09.982 --> 00:35:12.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What time was this?
-Ten or eleven?

611
00:35:12.985 --> 00:35:14.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I told him I was tired.

612
00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:17.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My back hurt. My feet.

613
00:35:19.992 --> 00:35:21.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was more than eight months pregnant.

614
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did he say why
he wanted you to come over?

615
00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:25.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

616
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He just said to come?

617
00:35:29.418 --> 00:35:31.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He said to bring cleaning supplies.

618
00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:36.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But... I forgot.

619
00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:42.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Drove over, let myself in.

620
00:35:43.432 --> 00:35:47.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frank was in the living room.
He told me not to get upset.

621
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was he upset?

622
00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:50.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was calm.

623
00:35:51.357 --> 00:35:54.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. So Frank tells you
not to get upset...

624
00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:58.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He told me something bad had happened.

625
00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:04.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My mind started racing, I was worried
something had happened to Benji.

626
00:36:07.915 --> 00:36:10.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frank said, "He's fine,
but he's done something."

627
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:14.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Benjamin did something?

628
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

629
00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:22.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I said, "What's he done?"

630
00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:27.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
