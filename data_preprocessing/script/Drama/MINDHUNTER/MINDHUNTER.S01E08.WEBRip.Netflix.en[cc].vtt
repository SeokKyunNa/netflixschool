[man] I understand what you're
trying to do, and I appreciate it.

7
00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:12.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Using Career Week to discuss
early intervention, it's a great idea.

8
00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had been thinking about
how we educate kids when you called.

9
00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:18.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And coming from the FBI,
it is a powerful statement.

10
00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But how do I get it across
if I can't use these words?

11
00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:29.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Mutilation."

12
00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:33.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you use that, I guarantee you
that at least one of them,

13
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:37.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jenny Cromer, Michael Stahl,
these are confident, curious children.

14
00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They will ask you what "mutilation" means.

15
00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And I can describe it, and specifically--
-And then...

16
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a few of them will go home,

17
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they'll have nightmares,

18
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and tomorrow I'll be fielding calls
from parents

19
00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:49.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who will be concerned--

20
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Parents should be discussing this, too.
-Absolutely.

21
00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if I had the time to build
a foundation for their understanding,

22
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'd be on board.

23
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So no "torture."

24
00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could I say "hurting"?

25
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:05.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Hurting" animals?

26
00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about "being mean" to animals?

27
00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You really think that "pyromania"
is too much?

28
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:15.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-My students will not know what that is.

29
00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-mm.

30
00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-"Deviant"?
-They will not know what that is.

31
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even if I used it in context?

32
00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's harsh.

33
00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We need to prepare them
for the world, yes.

34
00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we also need to protect them from it.

35
00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Guess I could say...

36
00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:34.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"disturbing."

37
00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen, Agent Ford.

38
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Show them your badge.

39
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They'll be thrilled.
-[bell rings]

40
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[light applause]

41
00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My job at the FBI is to study people
who exhibit disturbing behavior.

42
00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I can classify this behavior,

43
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can help the police catch these people
when they commit a crime.

44
00:03:57.528 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But lately I've been asking myself:

45
00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:04.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
can we stop these people from becoming
disturbing in the first place?

46
00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's where you come in.

47
00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By your age,
we can start seeing the signs.

48
00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:13.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In this whole classroom,
statistically speaking,

49
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
disturbing behavior would show up
in about one of you.

50
00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Say you have a friend
who likes lighting fires.

51
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, deliberately setting things
on fire, like toys or trash.

52
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Another sign that your friend
is disturbed,

53
00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:29.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is if he shows a lack of remorse.

54
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[man clears throat]

55
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:36.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is, if he's done something wrong,
he doesn't feel bad about it.

56
00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-Are only boys disturbed?

57
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps I should be saying he or she,

58
00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but yes, actually, it is mostly males
who are disturbed.

59
00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry, guys.
-[laughing]

60
00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Another thing you should be aware of
at your age

61
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is the way we treat animals.

62
00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now animals are nice to us,
so we should be nice back.

63
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But say you have a friend
who is being mean to an animal.

64
00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very mean. You should take note of that.

65
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:05.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

66
00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My brother throws rocks at our dog.

67
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that doesn't sound very nice,
but let me ask you:

68
00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:14.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
are they big rocks or little rocks?

69
00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mm... medium rocks.
-Okay.

70
00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The kind of behavior towards animals
that I'm talking about is, um...

71
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
forcible...

72
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[stammers] It's not just about
being mean to animals, it's...

73
00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's about hurting the animal,
and you'll know when that's happening

74
00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:35.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because an animal will let you know
when it is being hurt.

75
00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:43.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In any case, if you see this, you should
tell a teacher, or your mom, or your dad.

76
00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:48.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The idea is that you stop your friend,
who is a disturbing kid,

77
00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
from becoming a disturbing adult,

78
00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because one day he may start
being mean to people.

79
00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So...

80
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who wants to see my badge?

81
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:04.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all gasp]

82
00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[indistinct chatter]

83
00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It means so much to these students

84
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that someone like yourself
would take an interest.

85
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure, that was great. They're very smart.

86
00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:17.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Top standardized test scores
in the district.

87
00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, if you want to do any more outreach,
just let me know.

88
00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't say that, I'll hold you to it.
Thanks again.

89
00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:24.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

90
00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry. Bye.

91
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Ford?

92
00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:30.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm Janet Ebner.
I teach fourth grade here.

94
00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:35.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-May I have a moment?
-Sure.

95
00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know you weren't here today
to talk to us,

96
00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I've heard about some behavior
that I'd classify as disturbing.

97
00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:42.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

98
00:06:42.693 --> 00:06:46.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, odd at the very least,
but I believe my instincts are good.

99
00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:48.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It all starts with instinct.

100
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:50.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'm not the only one.

101
00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-What does that have to do with it?

209
00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's got extra energy.

210
00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apparently,
some parents are concerned, too.

211
00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:27.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She said that, but I never saw them.
-Did you follow up at all?

212
00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's no victim.
No one's pressing charges.

213
00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's touching kids.

214
00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Giving them money for it.

215
00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's tickling kids, that's not a crime.

216
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't arrest him
unless he does something illegal.

217
00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:42.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I explained this to Ms. Ebner,
I shouldn't have to explain it to the FBI.

218
00:12:43.512 --> 00:12:46.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unless you're gonna start predicting
what people do.

219
00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
May I see the report?

220
00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:54.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-I thought we might look into it.

221
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:55.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A foot tickler?

222
00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:58.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could be a form of podophilia...
like Brudos.

223
00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This guy's a grade school principal
with no record.

224
00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:02.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
People are concerned.
No one will help them.

00:13:03.073 --> 00:13:04.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just one teacher.
-No.

226
00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I talked to the superintendent.

227
00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:08.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some members of the school board
have been complaining.

228
00:13:08.996 --> 00:13:11.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] Holden, we have
a stack of applications to review.

229
00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:13.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't see your stack getting shorter.

230
00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:16.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I looked at them, all "nos."
-No as in, don't even interview?

231
00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:19.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're greenhorns.
-So were you.

232
00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We mainly need someone
to take over transcribing.

233
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're all gunning to talk
to lust murderers.

234
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They bring nothing to the table.

235
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tell Wendy.

236
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

237
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How's this?

238
00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:44.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Want me to take us

239
00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I decided last night. I'm not going.

240
00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:49.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-I'm not going back to Oregon.

241
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:52.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You expect me to interview Brudos alone?

242
00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:53.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you want.

243
00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:55.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we were just getting him to open up.

244
00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:57.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why I'm not going.

245
00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:59.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When did you get so fragile?

246
00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:00.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

247
00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:03.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bill... I do not want to do this alone.

248
00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:06.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So don't. We have a ton of material
from last time.

249
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:07.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not nearly enough.

250
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:10.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I just came up with a whole new strategy.
-Go for it.

251
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're really not coming.

252
00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm really not coming.

253
00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:20.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. Then I'll just show him that
one of us isn't a big, fat, fucking pussy.

254
00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Show him that.

255

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:54.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi.

257
00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Something wrong?
-I can't close my recorder.

258
00:14:58.397 --> 00:14:59.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give it to me.

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:01.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

260
00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm pretty handy.

261
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:09.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:13.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

264
00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:16.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I can use scissors

265
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Leather boring tools.

266
00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The parole board should really
take that into account.

267
00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:24.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:26.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:33.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He couldn't be here this time.
-Did I scare him off?

271
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. Uh...

272
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're doing some hiring

275
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:45.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:53.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. I'd like to take it from the murder

279
00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:54.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

280
00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:57.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Her car broke down on the highway,
you pulled over.

281
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

282
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Said, "Let's go home,

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:04.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

285
00:16:08.258 --> 00:16:09.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not?

286
00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:11.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was interested in my photography.

Funny how all these girls you met
wanted that.

289
00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:19.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Women like men to pay attention to 'em.

290
00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:21.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, did you...

291
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Invited her to the garage.
-Mm-hmm.

292
00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Took some photos--
-What kind of photos?

293
00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:28.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, headshots.

294
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:31.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. And after these headshots...

295
00:16:31.907 --> 00:16:33.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She decided to walk home.

296
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that's the last you saw of her.

297
00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:38.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Last anyone saw of her,
as far as I remember.

298
00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:42.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Her body was found in the Willamette River
tied to an auto transmission

299
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to weigh it down.

300
00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:47.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The transmission was traced back
to a car that you owned.

301
00:16:47.214 --> 00:16:48.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I know.

302
00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:51.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have any smokes?

303
00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:53.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

304
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:56.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So was that all part of the police plot?

305
00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:58.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah.

306
00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:01.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The transmission, the photos, the foot...
all of it.

307
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:05.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well...

308
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
someone killed those girls.

309
00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:11.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I know.
I have a whole theory about that.

310
00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:13.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

311
00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:15.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's hear it.

312
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:19.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well... these girls are disappearing.

313
00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:21.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Body parts showing up in the river.
Police get involved.

314
00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The killer realizes
things are heating up and splits.

315
00:17:25.335 --> 00:17:30.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably chopping up girls
in Seattle, Idaho, Canada, as we speak.

316
00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Meanwhile, they need to blame someone.

317
00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:34.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They catch me
sniffing around some coeds.

318
00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:36.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not saying I'm an angel.

319
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:38.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Search my house,
find a few pairs of shoes,

320
00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:41.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
decide I'm their fall guy.

321
00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:45.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone feels safe, DA gets re-elected,
yada yada yada.

322
00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:49.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a pretty big coincidence
that you met a couple of the girls

323
00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:50.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that became his victims.

324
00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:52.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huge coincidence.

325
00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:57.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think that he...
planned his attacks?

326
00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:03.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe the first one fell into his lap,

327
00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:07.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but then maybe after that,
he got a taste for it.

328
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:10.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. Now that's interesting.

329
00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:13.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because there were no photos
of the first girl, right?

330
00:18:15.302 --> 00:18:18.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the other three,
it was like he was prepared.

331
00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:23.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think
that even before the first one,

332
00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:26.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he fantasized about murdering a woman?

333
00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:27.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Definitely.

334
00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think he fantasized about?

335
00:18:33.028 --> 00:18:35.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Choking them, chopping them up,
all that stuff they said I did.

336
00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:40.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the murders were just an extension
of thoughts he already had,

337
00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
maybe for a long time.

338
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'd have to think about it pretty hard
to go through with it.

339
00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:47.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'd have to be... driven. [laughs]

340
00:18:47.751 --> 00:18:49.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mean like, out of control?

341
00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:53.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe his real life was out of control,
but his fantasy life was...

342
00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:57.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A... place where he could feel powerful.

343
00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:59.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Makes sense.
-But then why--

344
00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:02.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For example...

345
00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Laura Sullivan was hit from behind.

346
00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jane Weber was choked from behind.

347
00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:11.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would he do it that way?

348
00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:14.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't want them looking at him?

349
00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:17.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not?

350
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:21.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It might not have been
about watching them die.

351
00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:24.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, because then
he would have tortured them, right?

352
00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:28.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It might just been
about having them quiet.

353
00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:33.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that he could play with them?

354
00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:36.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like you'd play with a doll?

355
00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:40.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, there were all these photos of 'em
in different positions.

356
00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:42.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have intercourse with them?
-Sure.

357
00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:45.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then he played with some of them
before they died, as well.

358
00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:49.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kathy Schmidt was photographed
in a piece of lingerie that was not hers.

359
00:19:49.479 --> 00:19:51.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, she probably liked that.

360
00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:54.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, she was kidnapped
from a parking garage.

361
00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you know she was kidnapped?

362
00:19:56.403 --> 00:19:58.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think she went willingly?

363
00:19:59.406 --> 00:20:01.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All I'm saying is, all the women I meet...

364
00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:03.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Want to be models.

365
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So do you think that with Kathy Schmidt
it was consensual,

366
00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:11.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she didn't realize
that she was going to be killed?

367
00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She may have been getting the feeling,
you know.

368
00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:17.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, he may have made it clear
at a certain point

369
00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:21.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that she needed to take the pictures
if she wanted him to let her go.

370
00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:24.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She was playing along.
-Yeah.

371
00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you think the killer enjoyed that, too?

372
00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:31.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He might've thought that's what you get.

373
00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's what you get
when you want to be a model?

374
00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:37.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you want people to look at you.

375
00:20:42.115 --> 00:20:44.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think that the killer
found it exciting to, uh...

376
00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:49.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
get some of that control
back in his real life?

377
00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:50.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah.

378
00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:52.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Probably made him want more.

379
00:20:53.543 --> 00:20:55.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After he got a taste for it,
like you said.

380
00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:57.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After he got a taste.

381
00:20:59.132 --> 00:21:02.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess...
we all have fantasies, don't we?

382
00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:05.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can remember my first fantasy of girls.

383
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Brudos chuckles]

384
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What, um...

385
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was your first fantasy?

386
00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh... [exhales]

387
00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:17.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Must have been... nine or ten.

388
00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:22.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There was a woman in a tunnel.
I'd trapped her there.

389
00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:27.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was like this white shape
in the darkness.

390
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I made her do things.

391
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At that point, there wasn't even
anything sexual about it.

392
00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:35.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just remember her...

393
00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:40.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
begging for... mercy.

394
00:21:43.176 --> 00:21:45.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you still have fantasies, Jerry?

395
00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:50.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I don't.

396
00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:53.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tell the parole board that.

397
00:21:58.525 --> 00:22:00.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Day three, he takes the stand.

398
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now we knew he was lying,

399
00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:04.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it could've gone either way

400
00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:06.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because he had two other Klansmen
to back him up.

401
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So after lunch,
I waited for cross-examination.

402
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:11.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I slide right behind his girlfriend.

403
00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:13.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I drape my arm
across the back of her bench,

404
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I lean in real close, so, uh...

405
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:20.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The guy's eyes bug out.

406
00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:23.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He starts stammering,
he comes completely unglued,

407
00:22:23.633 --> 00:22:25.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and we get a conviction.
-[Carr] Amazing.

408
00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:28.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[man] Thirteen years. [laughs]
-[Tench] That is great.

409
00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:29.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great stories, Jim.

410
00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:31.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So nice to meet you.

411
00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks for coming
all the way up from Atlanta.

412
00:22:33.977 --> 00:22:35.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Word is out y'all are onto something big.

413
00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:38.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I couldn't wait to see for myself.
-[Carr] I hope we lived up to the hype.

414
00:22:38.982 --> 00:22:40.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you surpassed it.

415
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have to meet a few more people,
but we can let you know soon.

416
00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:47.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll say it one more time,
I'd love to join the team.

417
00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:50.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We'd love to have you.
-Thank you.

418
00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:00.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's black.

419
00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:02.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing gets past you.

420
00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:05.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's our best candidate.
I think we should hire him.

Our list of potential subjects are 80,
90 percent white and probably racist.

422
00:23:09.513 --> 00:23:10.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

423
00:23:10.847 --> 00:23:13.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He could incite a response
that affects the study.

424
00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:14.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That means no.

425
00:23:15.352 --> 00:23:18.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't put that on his assessment.
We can't be seen as racists.

426
00:23:18.438 --> 00:23:20.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought our newbies

427
00:23:20.398 --> 00:23:21.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did Brudos behave?

428
00:23:22.484 --> 00:23:23.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was almost pleasant.

429
00:23:24.277 --> 00:23:26.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

430
00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:29.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:36.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:36.123 --> 00:23:38.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

439

00:23:56.017 --> 00:23:58.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His dad and I studied pre-law together

441
00:23:59.646 --> 00:24:01.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope you give him a good shake.

442
00:24:09.489 --> 00:24:14.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's dark and all I see
is his knuckles gripping the stock,

00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:17.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:21.668 --> 00:24:24.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

446
00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:26.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:27.507 --> 00:24:29.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:39.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because he's so keyed up

451
00:24:39.352 --> 00:24:42.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had to pull him off the guy.
But anyway...

454
00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:52.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The guys call me "The Padre"

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

524
00:29:18.715 --> 00:29:22.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is because I apply a personal touch.

525
00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:25.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-These children matter to me.
-That is quite clear.

526
00:29:25.722 --> 00:29:29.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have special games, sports,

527
00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:31.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
art projects, teamwork activities.

528
00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:34.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am teaching happiness.

529
00:29:34.814 --> 00:29:37.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With all of that, why the need to tickle?

530
00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:40.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, let me give you an example.

531
00:29:41.154 --> 00:29:43.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We had this child, six years old,

532
00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:45.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who said he sprained his ankle
playing kickball

533
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and didn't want to go to class.

534
00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:50.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The nurse calls me down
because his ankle is not swollen,

535
00:29:50.997 --> 00:29:52.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but he's still claiming that it hurts.

536
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:55.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now... I don't want to call him a liar.

537
00:29:56.836 --> 00:29:59.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I wiggle his big toe.

538
00:30:00.173 --> 00:30:02.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does it hurt when this little piggy
goes to market?

539
00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:07.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How about when this little piggy
stays home? He smiles.

540
00:30:07.138 --> 00:30:09.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He says that it tickles.
So I tickle his feet.

541
00:30:09.682 --> 00:30:12.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The next thing I know, he's laughing.

542
00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:15.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's happy, he goes back to class.

543
00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:18.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you also give him a nickel?
-I'm sure I did.

544
00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:21.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the next time he goes to the store,
he can get himself--

545
00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:24.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What can you get for a nickel these days?
-A piece of bubble gum?

546
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Exactly.

547
00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:29.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Agent Ford,
you're blowing this out of proportion.

548
00:30:29.911 --> 00:30:31.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden]<i> We need to work</i>
<i>on your interview technique.</i>

549
00:30:31.913 --> 00:30:34.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry, was I supposed to be hard on him?
-You shouldn't team up.

550
00:30:36.042 --> 00:30:38.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you think that "piggy goes to market"
stuff was weird?

551
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:41.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my kids love
"Piggy Goes to the Market."

552
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:44.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, your kids love it from you.
-A tickle's a tickle.

553
00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:47.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe that's all it is, but...

554
00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:53.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if there is a sexual angle,
Roger would no doubt be good at hiding it.

555
00:30:54.435 --> 00:30:56.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When Kemper went in
for his last psychiatric evaluation,

556
00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:59.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he had a 15-year-old girl's head
in the trunk of his car.

557
00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:03.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It gave him a thrill to persuade
the committee successfully

558
00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:05.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that he was over
his psychological problems,

559
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
knowing that he had a trophy outside.

560
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:09.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't that kind of extreme?

561
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[children chattering]
-You get the idea.

562
00:31:15.582 --> 00:31:19.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm glad Janet finally did something.
Someone had to.

563
00:31:19.168 --> 00:31:21.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you don't approve of Roger's behavior?

564
00:31:21.337 --> 00:31:24.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've always thought
that tickling was bizarre enough,

565
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:26.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I get parents coming to me,

566
00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:28.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
asking why their children
suddenly have pocket change.

567
00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long has this gone on for?

568
00:31:30.763 --> 00:31:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've only been at Shady Lane two years.

569
00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:34.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It sounds like it goes back
further than that.

570
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:37.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are parents complaining to you?
Why not go to Roger?

571
00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:41.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He brushes them off, he's unapologetic,
and he's a big deal around here.

572
00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:44.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I agreed to meet with you
so I could share my thoughts,

573
00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:46.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I hope it doesn't get back to him.

574
00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:48.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You think he'd retaliate?
-I don't know.

575
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:51.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a small school,
everyone seems to know about the tickling.

576
00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:53.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How do the children respond
to his tickling?

577
00:31:53.953 --> 00:31:55.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They endure it.

578
00:31:55.288 --> 00:31:57.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They know they're going to get paid.

579
00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:59.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have students coming back
from his office,

580
00:31:59.459 --> 00:32:01.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
showing off their earnings.

581
00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What did you think of Roger
when you first came here,

582
00:32:03.546 --> 00:32:05.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
before you knew about this?

583
00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:07.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought he was smug.

584
00:32:08.384 --> 00:32:10.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I transferred because I heard
how great this place is,

585
00:32:11.054 --> 00:32:13.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but then that's all he talks about.

586
00:32:13.556 --> 00:32:15.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He really toots his own horn.

587
00:32:15.892 --> 00:32:18.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The teachers are supposed
to be cheerleaders.

588
00:32:18.353 --> 00:32:21.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I've always been uncomfortable
with how he handles the children.

589
00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:24.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What do you mean?
-He's always fussing over them.

590
00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:25.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] "Fussing"?

591
00:32:25.234 --> 00:32:28.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it's always touchy-touchy
and cutesey-cutesey. [scoffs]

592
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mrs. Clark, could you make a list
of parents and teachers

593
00:32:32.033 --> 00:32:33.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that feel the same way?

594
00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:35.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're meeting with a handful,

595
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but we'd like to get a sense
of the whole picture.

596
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:41.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is something wrong?

597
00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:44.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want a witch hunt.
I'm not vindictive.

598
00:32:44.921 --> 00:32:46.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just wish he'd listen.

599
00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:48.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[woman]<i> The students love Roger.</i>

600
00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:51.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When he visits the class,
I know it's going to be an easier day.

601
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He can turn a moody room
into an eager one just by walking in.

602
00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:57.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've heard about the tickling?

603
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

604
00:32:58.518 --> 00:33:00.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When my kids come back from his office,
they seem happy.

605
00:33:00.687 --> 00:33:01.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think about it?

606
00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:02.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's wonderful.

607
00:33:03.439 --> 00:33:05.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He turns punishment into play.

608
00:33:05.358 --> 00:33:07.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He makes it a positive experience.

609
00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:10.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nothing could be better for them.
-Have you had any parent complaints?

610
00:33:10.863 --> 00:33:14.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The parents I've talked to are thrilled.
Except about property taxes.

611
00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:17.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shady Lane has made this
a desirable neighborhood.

612
00:33:18.121 --> 00:33:19.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think of Janet Ebner?

613
00:33:20.748 --> 00:33:24.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I don't like to speak ill of people,
but she's a busybody.

614
00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:26.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think of Mrs. Clark?

615
00:33:26.921 --> 00:33:27.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's a crab.

616
00:33:29.757 --> 00:33:32.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. I think that's all we need.

617
00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:35.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you for talking with us.
-Thank you.

618
00:33:35.596 --> 00:33:37.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

619
00:33:39.642 --> 00:33:42.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He came home from Steve's house
and his tongue was blue.

620
00:33:42.979 --> 00:33:46.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not like Steve's mom
to give him candy, so I questioned him.

621
00:33:46.482 --> 00:33:50.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Found out they walked to the corner store
without asking, and bought Pop Rocks.

622
00:33:50.236 --> 00:33:51.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Boys will be boys.

623
00:33:51.904 --> 00:33:53.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not the point.

624
00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:58.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're, uh, in discussions about how much
leeway Jason is allowed at this age.

625
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, he's evasive when I ask him
where he got the money.

626
00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:07.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I call Steve's mom. She's having
the same conversation with her son.

627
00:34:07.754 --> 00:34:09.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Turns out they got it from Roger.

628
00:34:10.006 --> 00:34:11.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The principal...

629
00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:13.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
giving them money
without telling the parents.

630
00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:18.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then we find out, and this is why
Jason wouldn't tell me in the first place,

631
00:34:18.765 --> 00:34:20.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he and Steve were fighting
on the playground--

632
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They were kicking mud at each other,
they weren't fighting.

633
00:34:22.977 --> 00:34:26.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They were fighting,
they got sent to Roger's office.

634
00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:30.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He seats them side by side,
makes them take off their shoes and socks,

635
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:32.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and does this double tickling thing.

636
00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:35.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was Jason uncomfortable with the tickling?

637
00:34:35.114 --> 00:34:37.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think Jason understood
that it was inappropriate.

638
00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:40.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, he wasn't uncomfortable.
The boys made up again, all buddy-buddy.

639
00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:43.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they're nine-year-olds. Almost ten.

640
00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:46.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could see it if they were toddlers,
if this was preschool.

641
00:34:46.209 --> 00:34:47.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then there's the money.

642
00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:50.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And you went to Roger?
-[man] Yeah. We sat down with him.

643
00:34:50.338 --> 00:34:52.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He made it sound like
we were perverts for even asking.

644
00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:57.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How dare we deny our boy
the, um, affection that he provides?

645
00:34:57.386 --> 00:35:00.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Something like that.
I came away with the strangest feeling.

646
00:35:00.306 --> 00:35:03.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I mean, if you don't want people
touching your kid--

647
00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:06.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A middle-aged man
touching your child's feet.

648
00:35:06.145 --> 00:35:08.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should be able to tell them stop.

649
00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:09.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you ask him to stop?

650
00:35:09.899 --> 00:35:12.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Absolutely. And he said--
-Oh, yeah, listen to this.

651
00:35:13.903 --> 00:35:17.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"My covenant is not with you,
it's with your son."

652
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Covenant"? He used that word?

653
00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:20.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[woman] Yes.

654
00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:21.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he religious?

655
00:35:21.828 --> 00:35:23.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't know.
-[Gregg] It's an odd choice.

656
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole thing is odd.

657
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you think
should be done about him?

658
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I thought about suing.

659
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want to protect Jason,

660
00:35:35.174 --> 00:35:36.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but we aren't sure.

661
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And he wasn't traumatized.
I mean, quite the opposite.

662
00:35:40.429 --> 00:35:43.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We thought you might have suggestions,
because we don't know what to do.

663
00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, we don't know.

664
00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:47.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the third set of parents
who don't like it.

665
00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:49.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I guess they should have a say.
-I think they should.

666
00:35:49.897 --> 00:35:52.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But is there anything going on?
Is Roger dangerous?

667
00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:54.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone seems to agree
the children don't mind.

668
00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:55.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about when one does?

669
00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:57.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Brudos kept his urges in check
until something triggered him.

670
00:35:58.072 --> 00:35:59.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After that, everything escalated.

671
00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:02.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What if a kid decides to resist Roger?
-I read the Brudos files.

672
00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He had a history of offenses.
-It's a leap, but there is a correlation.

673
00:36:06.164 --> 00:36:09.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think Roger can help himself
any more than Brudos could stop killing.

674
00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:13.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In fact, giving them money might encourage
them to go to his office for "punishment."

675
00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:16.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why don't we ask him to stop?
-People have.

676
00:36:16.382 --> 00:36:19.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's tell him then.
We're the fucking FBI.

677
00:36:37.737 --> 00:36:41.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Roger]<i> Let's see if Mrs. Lane can come by</i>
<i>in the morning, before school.</i>

678
00:36:42.491 --> 00:36:45.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's her first year
and I think she's having some trouble

679
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
managing her students.

680
00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:48.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Wade, can we talk?

681
00:36:49.582 --> 00:36:51.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And, um, let's make a note

682
00:36:51.167 --> 00:36:53.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I've signed off on the lesson plan--
-In private?

683
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

684
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After speaking with parents and teachers,

685
00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:09.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we're advising you
to stop touching the children.

686
00:37:09.352 --> 00:37:10.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Advising me?

687
00:37:10.436 --> 00:37:14.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] It's a trivial activity.
Simply stopping will satisfy everyone.

688
00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:15.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is not trivial.

689
00:37:15.858 --> 00:37:18.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't make me sound
like some stranger in a raincoat.

690
00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:19.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're here at the request
of the superintendent.

691
00:37:20.029 --> 00:37:20.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

692
00:37:21.948 --> 00:37:25.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The superintendent of the schools
sent the FBI to advise me

693
00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:27.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to stop tickling children?

694
00:37:29.163 --> 00:37:30.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have been a principal for 15 years.

695
00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:34.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There hasn't been a shadow on my record
until now. How dare you.

696
00:37:35.503 --> 00:37:40.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How dare you accuse me of being
inappropriate with my own students.

697
00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:42.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're not accusing you.
Some people are uncomfortable.

698
00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:43.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are!

699
00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:46.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are uncomfortable, Agent Ford.
Why is that?

700
00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:49.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I was here for Career Day,
you asked me to edit my speech.

701
00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:52.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were worried how it would affect
the teachers and students. So I did.

702
00:37:52.311 --> 00:37:54.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I heard your concerns,
I followed your advice.

703
00:37:54.647 --> 00:37:58.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am advising you to hear the concerns
of your teachers and your school board--

704
00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:01.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You didn't know what the hell
you were doing that day. You still don't.

705
00:38:02.405 --> 00:38:04.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Deviant." "Torture." "Mutilation."

706
00:38:04.573 --> 00:38:07.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is your world,
and it has made you paranoid.

707
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is not my school.

708
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:13.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Wade.

709
00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am telling you this for your own good.

710
00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:21.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We all have to choose
between trust and fear.

711
00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:23.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you ever do have children,

712
00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:27.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope that you'll think long and hard
about how you want to raise them.

713
00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:33.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did we do the right thing?

714
00:38:34.937 --> 00:38:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this a federal issue?

00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:06.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:39:06.552 --> 00:39:07.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really need to study.

00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:09.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

722
00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:14.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You really have to leave me alone.
-I will. I promise.

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:17.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:23.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

He posits that life is like theater.

00:40:32.888 --> 00:40:35.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We tailor ourselves
to fit the parts that we're playing.

734
00:40:37.143 --> 00:40:38.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Meaning?

735
00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:41.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For instance, there's the expectation
that girls should be nice,

736
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-that they should smile.
-Okay.

737
00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:47.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I once tried not smiling
for a day, and it was really weird.

738
00:40:48.904 --> 00:40:51.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why? You're not much of a smiler.

739
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even so, it made me feel really odd
and it freaked people out.

740
00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:57.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Strangers kept asking, "Are you okay?"

741
00:40:57.496 --> 00:41:00.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you want to smile?
-No. Not once I realized what I was doing.

742
00:41:01.333 --> 00:41:04.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Goffman says we wear these masks
to make everyone else comfortable.

743
00:41:05.838 --> 00:41:06.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like you and your suits.

744
00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:08.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're not talking about my clothes again.

745
00:41:08.716 --> 00:41:11.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your suit is your uniform you wear
to fit in at Quantico.

746
00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:14.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't want to fit in.
-Everyone is trying to fit in.

747
00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:16.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Guess that explains
your hippie thing, too.

748
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:18.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My "hippie" thing?

749
00:41:18.934 --> 00:41:21.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your peasant tops, long hair,

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:24.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Right.

751
00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's exactly the same.

752
00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:27.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What would you wear
if no one were looking?

753
00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:30.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Probably nothing. What about you?

754
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:34.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'd wear my suit.
-[laughs] So sad.

755
00:41:36.619 --> 00:41:39.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder if that's why everyone's
so confused about Roger.

756

00:41:45.586 --> 00:41:48.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and applying it to the wrong environment.

758
00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:49.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's different.

759
00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:52.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look, I can't do this right now.

760
00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:54.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to finish

761
00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:57.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're doing this thing tomorrow night.
Come, if you're interested.

762

Blacking out a room

763
00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:03.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so people can interact without actually
being able to see each other.

764
00:42:03.437 --> 00:42:05.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My partner's making up
a questionnaire for them

765
00:42:05.439 --> 00:42:07.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to describe who they think they've met.

766
00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:09.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your partner?

767
00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:12.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Patrick.

768
00:42:14.406 --> 00:42:15.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

769
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:17.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Were you assigned?

770
00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:19.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, we're both working
on this Goffman book.

771
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, so you just have mutual interests.

772
00:42:22.122 --> 00:42:23.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess so.

773
00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Certainly seems like it.

774
00:42:26.168 --> 00:42:28.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is this you not smiling
as part of your experiment or...

775
00:42:28.963 --> 00:42:31.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, this is just me not smiling.

776
00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:34.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

777
00:42:37.137 --> 00:42:38.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[door opens]

778
00:42:42.184 --> 00:42:43.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good morning.

779
00:42:44.144 --> 00:42:45.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Morning.

780
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:47.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shepard wants to see you.

781
00:42:49.275 --> 00:42:50.484 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About what?

782
00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:51.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your little field trip.

783
00:42:55.447 --> 00:42:56.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How does he know?

784
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:17.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah. Agent Ford.

785
00:43:25.019 --> 00:43:28.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The superintendent asked me
to take a look at the situation.

786
00:43:28.147 --> 00:43:31.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you said, "Oh, yeah, this is exactly
what we do here at the FBI."

787
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:33.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just thought with the correlations
to the Brudos case--

788
00:43:33.902 --> 00:43:35.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you obsessed with feet?
-No, sir.

789
00:43:35.988 --> 00:43:38.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because that is the only connection
I can see. It is a thin one.

790
00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:41.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There were parents and teachers
who were concerned.

791
00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:42.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know the whole damn story.

792
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We bumped into each other
in the cafeteria.

793
00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:48.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is not about how I know, it is about
what the hell were you thinking?

794
00:43:48.375 --> 00:43:51.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sir, I thought I would see if the things
we're discovering in the interviews

795
00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:53.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
could apply to real-life situations.

796
00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:56.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Bureau does not do that. We do not
get involved until a crime is committed

797
00:43:56.925 --> 00:43:58.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and has risen to the level of our radar.

798
00:43:58.761 --> 00:44:03.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With all due respect, we've helped local
law enforcement solve two murder cases.

799
00:44:03.265 --> 00:44:05.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-In an advisory capacity--
-[Holden] We interviewed suspects.

800
00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:07.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On cases where there were actual crimes.

801
00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I spent a single day on Roger Wade.

802
00:44:09.772 --> 00:44:12.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was worried about children.
I had to follow my intuition.

803
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Your what?
-Mm...

804
00:44:16.737 --> 00:44:19.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My intuition started this.
I wanted to interview Kemper.

805
00:44:19.198 --> 00:44:21.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Without me,
there would be no study, no funding.

806
00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:25.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So now you know everything, is that it?
Now you're Superman, with X-ray vision?

807
00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:27.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, but I should be allowed a day to--

808
00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:30.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Predict if someone might commit a crime?

809
00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who are you, the fucking thought police?

810
00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you both.

811
00:44:37.299 --> 00:44:38.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Agent Smith, in your new BSU position,

812
00:44:39.051 --> 00:44:41.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the last thing you should be following
is Agent Ford's intuition.

813
00:44:57.986 --> 00:45:00.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Surprise, surprise, he had my ass.

814
00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You handed it to him.
-Thanks, Bill.

815
00:45:02.324 --> 00:45:05.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't know what you were thinking.
-Apparently, no one does.

816
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'd like you to ask
before you do something like that again.

817
00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Your behavior reflects on us.

818
00:45:10.999 --> 00:45:14.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You cannot use the study as justification
to launch personal campaigns.

819
00:45:14.586 --> 00:45:16.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that what you think I'm doing?
-I really don't know.

820
00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:20.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't imagine why you would go after
a respected school principal

821
00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:21.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with no history of abuse.

822
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because you weren't there.
Even Gregg saw something wasn't right.

823
00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:26.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's an incorrect application
of the concepts

824
00:45:26.598 --> 00:45:27.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that I'm trying to teach you.

825
00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:30.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This has nothing to do with concepts.
-She's right, Holden.

826
00:45:31.687 --> 00:45:34.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What if some guy
were tickling Brian's feet?

827
00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:38.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't bring my kid into this.
-Not just some guy, but a guy in power,

828
00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:40.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the head of the school
where he will be for years.

829
00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:43.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He not only tickles,
but gives money for putting up with it.

830
00:45:43.365 --> 00:45:45.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do not use my family as an example.

831
00:45:45.492 --> 00:45:48.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You ask him to stop, he won't.
You go to the police, they blow it off.

832
00:45:48.704 --> 00:45:51.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it looks like Brian is going
to get paid to get his feet tickled,

833
00:45:51.665 --> 00:45:54.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and who knows what else,
and there's nothing you can do.

834
00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:56.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd tell him to take his fucking hands
off my kid,

835
00:45:56.795 --> 00:45:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just like I'm telling you
to stop using him as an excuse
