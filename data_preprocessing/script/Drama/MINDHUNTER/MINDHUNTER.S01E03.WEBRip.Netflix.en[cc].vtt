about any of that?

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Agent Ford. I've read a lot about you.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, thank you.

24
00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:17.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, um, let's go to my office.

<i>When you sent me your notes</i>
<i>from the Kemper meetings,</i>

27
00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I was in a real rut with my new book.</i>

28
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's your book about?
-It's about white-collar criminals,

29
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
men not so different
to your Edmund Kemper.

30
00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:34.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How do you think the men you study
are similar to Edmund Kemper?

31
00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:37.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, first of all,
they're all psychopaths.

32
00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I study captains of industry:

33
00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
IBM, MGM, Ford, Exxon, you name it.

34
00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And sure, these men all have
wives, kids, dogs, goldfish,

35
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:48.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but not because they stopped
being psychopaths,

36
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but because they just had
different leanings.

37
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you think they have the same
underlying personality traits?

38
00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, Kemper shows
a total lack of remorse,

39
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a lack of inner emotional structure,

40
00:04:58.172 --> 00:05:00.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
no ability to reflect
on the experience of others.

41
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You saw this in my notes?
-It would've been clearer

42
00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if you'd recorded and transcribed
your interviews verbatim,

43
00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but yeah.

44
00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although your project
is obviously in the nascent stages,

45
00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:13.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it already feels like a clear successor
to<i> The Mask of Sanity,</i>

46
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which, as you know,
is quite a compliment.

47
00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Repeat that?<i> The Mask of...</i>

48
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] So you're saying
you don't think this,

49
00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
us interviewing these killers, is crazy?

50
00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carr] Just the opposite.

51
00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, crazy in the way that anyone
with a truly new idea is crazy.

52
00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But no.
-Wow, okay.

53
00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a relief.

54
00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:33.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That hasn't really been the feedback
we've gotten so far.

55
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, this is the only feedback
we've gotten so far.

56
00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:38.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, these men are just sitting here,
locked up.

57
00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we're too afraid of the morality of it

58
00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to see the far-reaching value
of their insights.

59
00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:44.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Far-reaching in law enforcement?

60
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Into behavioral science, early detection,
criminology, you name it.

61
00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, yes, yes. This is what
I've been saying the whole time.

62
00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, have you?

63
00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carr] You need to put this
on a more formal footing.

64
00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:56.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gonna take a lot of time and energy

65
00:05:56.898 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to expand it into a larger project
with a specific questionnaire.

66
00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:02.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Their family histories,

67
00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
what their thoughts were
on why they did it,

68
00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:07.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when they were aroused
during the killings, that sort of thing.

69
00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:10.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then contrast, compare, and publish.

70
00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:11.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Publish?

71
00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:14.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carr] Well, you can't just circulate
your findings within the FBI.

72
00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:16.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I mean, maybe even turn it into a book.
-A book?

73
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whoa.
We appreciate the vote of confidence,

74
00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but we weren't allowed
to send you those notes.

75
00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We can't publicize what we're doing.
-[Carr] Why not?

76
00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:26.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] Our department head
gave us weekends only

77
00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and an office in the basement.

78
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We still have students,
we have Road School full-time.

79
00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We can't just drop everything--
-Road School?

80
00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:35.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We travel around the country
and teach FBI techniques to cops.

81
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.
-We're seeing Benjamin Miller

82
00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:38.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in Bridgewater this afternoon.

83
00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:41.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Road School is what gives us the freedom
to go out and interview these guys.

84
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can go bit by bit.

85
00:06:43.277 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kemper and Miller
and build out from there.

86
00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Make a study in our free time,
like you said.

87
00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't realize
that this was so informal.

88
00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We could make it formal.
We can do that easily. And then a book.

89
00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:54.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The successor to<i> The Mask of--</i>

90
00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess I just wanted to get
another set of eyes,

91
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
see if you thought this was valuable
from an academic standpoint.

92
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:05.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have you shown your Kemper notes
to your department head?

93
00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:07.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

94
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Teaching police departments,
can someone else do that?

95
00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Anyone can, it's really not that hard.
-That is not true,

96
00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:14.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's beside the point.

97
00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shepard doesn't even want us
to talk about this.

98
00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:20.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You really think he's going to say yes
to a full-time academic study?

99
00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:20.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind a book?

100
00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:27.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think people would be interested
in this outside of law enforcement?

101
00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, imagine,

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
like truly imagine what it takes
to bludgeon someone to death.

103
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The lust for control,

104
00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:39.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the feeling of arousal,

105
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the decision to rape the severed head
of your victim,

106
00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to humiliate her corpse.

107
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How could you possibly get that
from an ordinary police report?

108
00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:53.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know why it took me nearly a decade
to publish my book?

109
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because narcissists
don't go to the doctor.

110
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Psychopaths are convinced
that there is nothing wrong with them.

111
00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:02.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So these men
are virtually impossible to study.

112
00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:08.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yet you have found a way to study them
in near perfect laboratory conditions.

113
00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:11.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's what make this so exciting
and potentially so far-reaching.

114
00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:14.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not that I disagree.
I've spent enough time with Holden

115
00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that I know what it means
when he gets that crazy look.

116
00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm afraid it's just not feasible
within the bureaucracy of the FBI.

117
00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've got weekends.
We've got the evenings after Road School,

118
00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:26.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
an hour or so before Road School.
We don't have to tell Shepard.

119
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Interviewing 40 men across the States
is a full-time job.

120
00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if you want this to be
a legitimate academic study,

121
00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then you're looking
at four, maybe five years.

122
00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:36.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And compiling, analyzing the data.
-Right.

123
00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:39.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Well...

124
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a shame.

125
00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:47.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have an interview with Miller
in an hour and it's a bit of a drive.

126
00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, this is really important work.

127
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If your boss won't let you do it,

128
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then you should talk to someone
who has the freedom and resources to--

129
00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.121 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] We'll stick with it for now.

130
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'll be slow going,
but we're not ready to give up yet.

131
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course not.

132
00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:06.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's good to get some encouragement,
even if our hands are tied.

133
00:09:07.004 --> 00:09:07.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

134
00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:09.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a pleasure.

135
00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What if--
-Don't.

136
00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:14.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm just saying we could--
-Holden.

137
00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look, I'm frustrated too.

138
00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:25.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, they shoot the birds in the yard
because they might be smuggling in drugs.

139
00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I don't know if that's true.
A girlfriend told me once.

140
00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You date a lot of ex-cons?
-No.

141
00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:38.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, Debbie's the first girl
I've really dated-dated since high school.

142
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Dated-dated.
-Yeah.

143
00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My wife's the first woman
that I've married-married.

144
00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:48.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought they said 3:00.
What are we waiting for?

145
00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'd be less fidgety
if you smoked cigarettes.

146

147
00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should have brought a tape recorder.

148

150
00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:18.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gentlemen. I'm Dr. Cale.
We spoke earlier on the phone.

151
00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:21.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks for doing this, Doctor.
We realize it's somewhat unorthodox.

152
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately,
Miller says he won't talk to you.

153
00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:28.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, we told him in advance and he agreed,
but there's really nothing we can do now.

154
00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He should be in a better mood tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

155
00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, he gets like this sometimes.

156
00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:35.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just needs a cool-off period
before he can interact with people.

157
00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:38.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have to bring him food into his cell
because he won't come out.

158
00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're headed out tonight.
We can't come in tomorrow.

159
00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:43.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry.
Will you be back to Boston another time?

160
00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:45.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps.

161
00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks for your time, Doctor.
We appreciate it.

162
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

163
00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:54.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that's the last time
we give them advanced notice.

00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

in your head?

Dr. Carr said it could have
far-reaching consequences.

174
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:43.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

413
00:24:13.743 --> 00:24:16.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh! He's gonna make a speech.
Inform us, oh, wise one.

00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:18.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

416
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just wanted to say thank you
for having this get-together.

417
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:26.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Roy, thank you for acknowledging
what my partner Bill and I are doing.

418
00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:32.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And for embracing that,
if we all work together,

419
00:24:33.388 --> 00:24:37.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we can venture into the blackest night
and shine a light on the darkness.

420
00:24:41.229 --> 00:24:43.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm talking about real darkness.

421
00:24:45.108 --> 00:24:47.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And thanks for the beer.
-[all cheering]

422
00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:49.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were happy to help.

423
00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:51.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Congratulations, guys.

424
00:24:52.073 --> 00:24:53.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good work.

00:25:01.082 --> 00:25:03.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If only you could
shine a light on the darkness,

428
00:25:03.418 --> 00:25:06.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you could illuminate my keys.
[chuckles]

429
00:25:11.092 --> 00:25:13.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very, very funny.

434
00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[man] Dynamite!

435
00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:34.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] Okay. You got us.

436
00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:35.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good job.

437
00:25:44.084 --> 00:25:46.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[softly] Yeah, I wanted to hear
how you're doing. That's all.

438
00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:52.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His teacher?

439
00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:00.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry to hear that.

440
00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:06.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I don't think we'll be back in time.

441
00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:11.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So...

442
00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:17.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. I just wanted to hear your voice.

443
00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:20.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give him a kiss from Dad.

444
00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Love you too.

445
00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:35.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] I'm sorry, Ed,

446
00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:38.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
do you mean that violence in the movies
drove you to kill those women?

447
00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:39.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

448
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:43.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My point is, in reality,
it doesn't work the way you expect.

449
00:26:43.893 --> 00:26:47.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you stab somebody,
they're supposed to fall dead.

450
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They go, "Oh..."

451
00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:50.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And they fall dead, right?
-Right.

452
00:26:50.692 --> 00:26:54.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In reality, when you stab somebody,
they lose blood pressure

453
00:26:54.362 --> 00:26:57.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they leak to death very slowly.

454
00:26:57.699 --> 00:27:00.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I was reluctant, I didn't enjoy it.

455
00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:03.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you get that on tape?

456
00:27:03.872 --> 00:27:04.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

457
00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:09.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, it all really goes back

458
00:27:10.045 --> 00:27:15.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to my perceived inability
to communicate socially, sexually.

459
00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:19.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was scared to death of failing
in male-female relationships,

460
00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:22.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even sitting down to talk to a young lady.

461
00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:25.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanted to communicate.

462
00:27:25.685 --> 00:27:28.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ironically enough,
that's why I began picking people up.

463
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I pick a girl up

464
00:27:30.732 --> 00:27:33.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I'm going a little further each time.

465
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a daring kind of a thing.

466
00:27:35.236 --> 00:27:37.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like, first, there wasn't a gun.

467
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I'm driving along,

468
00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:42.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we go to a vulnerable place
where there aren't people watching,

469
00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:43.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I say, "No, I can't."

470
00:27:43.953 --> 00:27:46.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you picked up women
but didn't kill them?

471
00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:49.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But then, a gun is in the car,

472
00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:50.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and this craving,

473
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this awful raging, eating feeling
is inside me.

474
00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:57.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would've loved to have just raped them,

475
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:00.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but not having any experience at all,

476
00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:04.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could feel it consuming my insides,
this fantastic passion.

477
00:28:05.058 --> 00:28:06.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fantastic passion?

478
00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:10.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a good phrase, no?
-Then what happens?

479
00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:12.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I'm thinking of writing
my own book.

480
00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been trying to get a typewriter.
Maybe help me with that?

481
00:28:15.443 --> 00:28:17.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sure we could pull some strings.

482
00:28:17.695 --> 00:28:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then it builds, the feeling?

483
00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:20.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At some point, you begin to...

484
00:28:21.408 --> 00:28:23.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-enjoy the thrill.
-[Ed] Look...

485
00:28:24.077 --> 00:28:26.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when you slit a person's throat,

486
00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:28.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you need to cut it from ear to ear

487
00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:31.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in order to sever the windpipe
and the jugular

488
00:28:31.459 --> 00:28:33.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that they bleed and suffocate
at the same time.

489
00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Otherwise, they'll just be
in a great deal of pain.

490
00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:39.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's how I learnt the term "ear to ear,"

491
00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:41.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
literally, what that meant.

492
00:28:41.177 --> 00:28:43.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
People think it's just an expression.

493
00:28:43.596 --> 00:28:45.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not, it's an instruction.

494
00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:48.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't want to. You have to.

495
00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:49.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So there's no pleasure, Ed?

496
00:28:49.853 --> 00:28:51.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ed] Sure there is.

497
00:28:51.187 --> 00:28:53.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just wanted the exaltation
over the party.

498
00:28:54.607 --> 00:28:56.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In other words, winning over death.

499
00:28:57.026 --> 00:28:59.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They were dead and I was alive.
That was the pleasure.

500
00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:02.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was the hunter, they were my victims.

501
00:29:02.699 --> 00:29:04.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So how did you feel
after your first kills?

502
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[clears throat, sighs]

503
00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:13.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I liked Mary the best.

504
00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:15.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was lukewarm on Anita.

505
00:29:17.213 --> 00:29:18.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was wrong with her?

506
00:29:19.048 --> 00:29:20.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ed] Oh, nothing in particular.

507
00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:22.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was more that Mary was...

508
00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:29.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was really quite struck
by her personality and her looks,

509
00:29:29.142 --> 00:29:31.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and there was just almost
a reverence there.

510
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Reverence?
-Sure.

511
00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:36.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes, afterward,
I visited there to be near her

512
00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:38.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because I loved her and wanted her.

513
00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:40.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At the murder site?

514
00:29:40.361 --> 00:29:42.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never been much to look at myself,

515
00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:44.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I've always gone after
the pretty girls.

516
00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:46.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I bet you're the same.

517
00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:48.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

518
00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:51.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You probably can't imagine this,

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:54.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but since I was locked up
from age 15 to 21

520
00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:56.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for the murder of my grandparents,

521
00:29:56.795 --> 00:30:00.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was very much out of touch
with women my own age.

522
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:04.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I got back on the street,
it was like being on a strange planet.

523
00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:07.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had been living with people
older than I was for so long,

524
00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:09.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was like an old fogy.

525
00:30:09.224 --> 00:30:10.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That must have been jarring.

526
00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:12.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ed] You know,
when I confessed to the police,

527
00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:16.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they drove me through California
and we stopped by a diner for some food.

528
00:30:16.898 --> 00:30:19.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some attractive young ladies
walked by the car.

529
00:30:20.735 --> 00:30:21.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I vomited.

530
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right there and then, on the police car,
in front of all the cops.

531
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:26.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite violently.

532
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was just how I reacted to women.

533
00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:30.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had no other way.

534
00:30:31.913 --> 00:30:33.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me ask you something.

535
00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:37.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ever talk with anyone about this?

536
00:30:37.877 --> 00:30:39.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About your inclinations?

537
00:30:41.297 --> 00:30:43.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your mom... maybe?

538
00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:46.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously,
not the way you're talking to us.

539
00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:51.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I could get a word in edgewise,

540
00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:54.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
everything would have been different.

541
00:30:54.435 --> 00:30:58.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
From the moment I woke up in the morning,
she was demeaning and belittling.

542
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And she knew all of my buttons

543
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because she put them there.

544
00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:05.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was her toy all my life,

545
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
right up until the moment
I cut off her head with a hunting knife.

546
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:11.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ed...

547
00:31:13.162 --> 00:31:15.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
why did you do what you did...

548
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:17.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with her head?

549
00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:21.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why does anyone?

550
00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:26.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know,
that night I walked up to her bed.

551
00:31:26.092 --> 00:31:30.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's laying there reading a paperback,
as many thousands of nights before.

552
00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:36.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She says, "Oh, I suppose you're gonna
want to wait up all night and talk now."

553
00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:39.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you believe that?

554
00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:42.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Wait up all night talking."

555
00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:44.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shit.

556
00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I knew I was gonna kill her...

557
00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:51.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you know?

558
00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:54.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was honest with myself
for the first time.

559
00:31:56.414 --> 00:31:58.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I'm not a lizard,

560
00:31:58.541 --> 00:32:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not from under a rock,
I came out of her vagina.

561
00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:03.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I came out of my mother.

562
00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:08.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it true that you put part of her
into the garbage disposal?

563
00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her vocal cords.

564
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

565
00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I couldn't shut her up.

566
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:20.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She wanted to destroy me
with words, literally.

567
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I shut her up for good.

568
00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:26.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now, everyone knows it was
because of what she did to me,

569
00:32:26.402 --> 00:32:28.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because of the way she treated her son.

570
00:32:33.534 --> 00:32:36.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[keys jingling, door unlocks]

571
00:32:38.581 --> 00:32:39.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pizza!

572
00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:41.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys.

573
00:32:44.587 --> 00:32:47.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. So you get out of the car...

574
00:32:47.507 --> 00:32:50.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I just walk into the apartment building.
-Anyone around?

575
00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:51.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I'm home,

576
00:32:51.928 --> 00:32:54.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
walking up the stairs to our apartment

577
00:32:54.097 --> 00:32:57.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a freshly severed head draining
about a pint of blood into a duffel bag.

578
00:32:57.433 --> 00:33:00.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just got it under your arm?
Just like that?

579
00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:02.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Tench] Take another slice.
-Thank you.

580
00:33:02.522 --> 00:33:05.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then comes this picture postcard,

581
00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:07.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
groovy, happy young couple on the stairs.

582
00:33:07.527 --> 00:33:10.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They walk right past me.
-Your two worlds are colliding...

583
00:33:10.321 --> 00:33:12.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My murderous fantasy life and this.

584
00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:16.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pretty girl. Pretty name.
Kim or something.

585
00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:18.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Going out on a date with her boyfriend.

586
00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:20.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it could just as easily
be Kim's head in that bag.

587
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're playing God.
-Exactly.

588
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:27.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I realized I've never been on a date
in my entire life, ever.

589
00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:30.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I got in the door and I said to Mom,

590
00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:33.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"I've never been on a date
with a girl, Mom."

591
00:33:33.094 --> 00:33:35.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Tench] And what did she say?
-"Thank God."

592
00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:37.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can you believe that?
-[sighs] What a bitch.

593
00:33:37.557 --> 00:33:40.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's when I started burying the heads
in the backyard.

594
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sure.
-Right underneath Mom's bedroom window.

595
00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:46.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Their faces looking right up
at her window while she was at home.

596
00:33:46.482 --> 00:33:48.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right under her nose, man.
I couldn't help myself.

597
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the fuck?

598
00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:54.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know it's silly, but Mom always
liked people to look up to her.

599
00:33:54.407 --> 00:33:56.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[both laugh]
-Whoa.

600
00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:09.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[car starts]

601
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden sniffing] Ugh!

602
00:34:40.828 --> 00:34:42.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I still smell like Kemper.

603
00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:46.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Or maybe it's just CMF.
-[Tench laughs]

604
00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] It did smell pretty bad,
like a locker room.

605
00:34:49.337 --> 00:34:51.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] Gonna make me
lose my appetite.

606
00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:01.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So...

607
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you like your mom?

608
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:06.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry. Not funny.

609
00:35:08.397 --> 00:35:10.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I liked my mom.

610
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But she's not around anymore.

611
00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:17.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You like your wife?

612
00:35:19.575 --> 00:35:21.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes, I do.
-That's good.

613
00:35:23.204 --> 00:35:26.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've known her all my life.
I'm not sure what I'd do without her.

614
00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:29.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How about that girlfriend?
-Yeah.

615
00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:32.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's great. Smart.

616
00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:34.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think she actually likes me.

617
00:35:36.843 --> 00:35:38.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sounds like we got it made.

618
00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:41.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden]<i> It feels good, doesn't it?</i>

619
00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:44.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To fly home having got the bad guy,
just like in the movies.

620
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:47.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. It feels good
that Dwight's off the street.

621
00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:49.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Kemper has a way of tempering that.

622
00:35:50.106 --> 00:35:52.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He makes you sick to your stomach,
doesn't he?

623
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:54.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

624
00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:55.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
More than Dwight?

There's nothing behind Kemper's eyes.
It's like standing near a black hole.

626
00:36:00.908 --> 00:36:03.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right.
-And he thinks we're his friends.

627
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, he thinks you're his friend.

628
00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:11.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which makes you a pretty great FBI agent.

629
00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:24.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been thinking
about our conversation with Dr. Carr.

630
00:36:27.602 --> 00:36:28.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have?

631
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're good at this shit,

632
00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:34.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even if it turns my stomach.

633
00:36:34.984 --> 00:36:37.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we're gonna take a backseat
to everything new,

634
00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:38.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
everything interesting...

635
00:36:38.487 --> 00:36:39.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

636
00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:42.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If she really thinks
the idea is that good,

637
00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:45.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that it has that much potential
to change people's lives...

638
00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah?
-...maybe we should invite her down.

639
00:36:49.498 --> 00:36:52.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just for a day, to strategize.

640
00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:54.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's a fantastic idea.

641
00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:56.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At least we could compile
what we have so far

642
00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:59.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and create a plan
so if we want to talk to Shepard--

643
00:36:59.842 --> 00:37:01.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we can be prepared.

644
00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:04.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a long shot.

645
00:37:05.306 --> 00:37:06.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He hates you already.

646
00:37:07.767 --> 00:37:09.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's beginning to hate you, too.

647
00:37:09.685 --> 00:37:11.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

648
00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:13.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

649
00:37:14.982 --> 00:37:16.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So why half-ass it?

650
00:37:18.945 --> 00:37:22.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] Dwight would have kept doing it,
just like Kemper,

651
00:37:22.114 --> 00:37:24.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
until he finally made his way
to the source.

652
00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:27.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's kind of prosaic
that it's always the mother.

653
00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:31.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was the mother,
but in a very different way.

654
00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:34.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
More...

655
00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:36.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
love.

656
00:37:36.295 --> 00:37:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you can even call it that.

657
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:39.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was she hot?

658
00:37:40.216 --> 00:37:41.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who?
-His mom?

659
00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:43.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ugh...

660
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:49.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Guys in my high school thought my mom
was hot and it always really disgusted me.

661
00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:52.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then she went through chemo
and nobody made jokes about her anymore

662
00:37:52.812 --> 00:37:55.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and it kind of made me sad.
-I didn't know your mom had cancer.

663
00:37:56.315 --> 00:37:59.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why I'm always asking you
to grab my boobs when we're fucking.

664
00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:03.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Make you check for cancerous lumps.
-Oh, is that why? [spits]

666
00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:11.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't let these guys rub off on me.

667
00:38:11.872 --> 00:38:14.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The way they view sex.
-And women.

668
00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:25.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks for coming.

669
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:28.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I needed to see you.

670
00:38:32.518 --> 00:38:34.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now that I'm all clean...

671
00:38:37.231 --> 00:38:41.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If going down on me while I'm filing
my nails is your idea of being kinky...

672
00:38:42.111 --> 00:38:43.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm kinky.

673
00:38:48.451 --> 00:38:49.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm very kinky.

674
00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:53.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could impale you with this nail file.

675
00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:56.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I could be a part of your case study.

676
00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:59.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You would be
a very compelling interviewee.

677
00:39:17.063 --> 00:39:19.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] Hey, Kenneth,
can I ask you something?

678
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sure. What's on your mind?

679
00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:24.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've, uh, done a bit of thinking about
some of the things that we're teaching.

680
00:39:24.904 --> 00:39:28.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In particular,
the list of deviant terminology.

681
00:39:28.115 --> 00:39:29.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cuss words?

682
00:39:29.241 --> 00:39:31.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. Well, I was thinking more the...

683
00:39:32.286 --> 00:39:34.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-descriptors of the acts.
-Uh...

684
00:39:34.997 --> 00:39:36.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, fellatio, cunnilingus--

685
00:39:36.957 --> 00:39:39.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, what exactly is the issue?

686
00:39:39.085 --> 00:39:41.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that's just it, Ken.
I don't have an issue.

687
00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:43.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really don't know that they are deviant.

688
00:39:44.757 --> 00:39:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anal violation?

689
00:39:46.425 --> 00:39:47.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, no, not that one.

690
00:39:47.635 --> 00:39:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you talked to Bill about this?
-Oh, sure.

691
00:39:49.804 --> 00:39:51.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bill agrees with me.

692
00:39:52.098 --> 00:39:54.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you think we should alter
the curriculum?

693
00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:56.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just... take a look at the list.

694
00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:59.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Think about it, okay?
-Mm-hmm. Hmm.

695
00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:05.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

696
00:40:05.611 --> 00:40:06.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

697
00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That, too.

698
00:40:08.364 --> 00:40:09.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we're keeping "gang bang"?

699
00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's right is right.

700
00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:12.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

701
00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:14.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

702
00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Enemas. Either giving or having.

703
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

705
00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:29.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

707
00:40:30.803 --> 00:40:31.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:36.725 --> 00:40:37.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I consulted her

713
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
