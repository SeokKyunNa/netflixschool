20
00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

21
00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:25.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is not an easy thing
to break a human being's jaw.

22
00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

23
00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

41
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll do it,

53
00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

54
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

55
00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:15.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We will be asking you

61
00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
antecedent behavior,

62
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and thought patterns surrounding

63
00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:38.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our goal is to eventually publish

66
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thought this was gonna break
the monotony.

67
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can go straight to the questions,
if you prefer.

68
00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:52.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please.

69
00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:53.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Let's discuss the pre-crime phase.

71
00:05:56.773 --> 00:06:00.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Specifically, the day before you killed
your first victim, Laura Sullivan.

72
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't kill Laura Sullivan.

73
00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You didn't kill...

74
00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:09.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They never found her body.
I was never convicted of that murder.

75
00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.953 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Holden] But you confessed to it.

76
00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:15.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On... June 27, 1969,

77
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you confessed to murdering Laura Sullivan,

78
00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't go by that.
-[Holden] Why not?

79
00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was given under coercion.

80
00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:25.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're saying it was forced?

81
00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am looking
at three consecutive life sentences

82
00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:30.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
thanks to an elaborate plot
by the Portland PD.

83
00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You pleaded guilty
to three counts of murder.

84
00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They drugged me. Beat me.

85
00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wouldn't let me talk to a lawyer.

86
00:06:38.147 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Turned away my wife.

87
00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:43.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Told me they'd go after my kids
if I didn't confess.

88
00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:45.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you saying
you never met Laura Sullivan?

89
00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I met her.
She was wandering around my front yard.

90
00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Selling encyclopedias.

91
00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:51.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That part of the confession is correct?
-Sure.

92
00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:54.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You said...

93
00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:56.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
she was lost.

94
00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:59.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was raining,
she couldn't find the right address.

95
00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you told her
that you ordered the encyclopedias.

96
00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:02.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nope.

97
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You didn't say that?

98
00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We got to chatting.

99
00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was an aspiring model.

100
00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not surprising, she was beautiful.

101
00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I said I'd take some photos of her.

102
00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:20.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that when you invited her in,
took her to the garage?

103
00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:21.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then you hit her with a two-by-four?

107
00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:30.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

111
00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:45.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The day before you met Laura Sullivan.
Can you tell me what you were feeling?

112
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:48.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You consider yourself a bit

113
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got my first camera at 15.

114
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

115
00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:55.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mm... it's women, isn't it?
Can't call them ladies anymore.

116
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

119
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shoe catalogs.

120
00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's my smut.

121
00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you masturbate to it?

122
00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's usually how it works.

123
00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:11.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you masturbate

124
00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

125
00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:16.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The photos the police found

126
00:08:17.788 --> 00:08:20.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

127
00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're sloppy. I didn't take those.

128
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] Actually, we did see them.
There's one of them...

129
00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Holden, maybe you can find it.

130
00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

131

132
00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:44.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ever since the kids were small,
I get these blackouts.

133
00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's hypoglycemia, low blood sugar.

134
00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:50.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could walk off the roof of a building
and not know it.

135
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:53.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You see that?

136
00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's you in the photo.

137
00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which means you took this photo.

138
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which means you killed that girl.

139
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

140
00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:09.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kemper was right.

141
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kemper?

142
00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Brudos] He said you guys were idiots.

143
00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I'd call you fucking morons.

Big Ed with his big mouth.

146
00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:28.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bet you swallowed
every fucking line that came out of him.

147
00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And he must have loved it.

148
00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:34.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute. As far as I know,
all his communication is monitored.

149
00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What can I say?

150
00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

152
00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fuck if I know. We should find out.

153
00:09:48.629 --> 00:09:51.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, yeah. It's got to affect the study
if our subjects are all pen pals.

154
00:09:51.882 --> 00:09:54.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll call the superintendent at Vacaville.

155
00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:55.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or let's just go back and ask.

156
00:09:56.637 --> 00:10:00.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are the chances
the warden's gonna know what's going on?

157
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You might as well call.

158
00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:03.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you really think
that Kemper called us idiots?

159
00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn't sound like Ed to me.

160
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We could phone Kemper, ask him directly.

161
00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:14.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-If he talks to Brudos.

162
00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then we would be idiots.

163
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:19.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Excuse me.
I believe I'm in the middle seat.

164
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, yeah? Well, that's all right.
You can have the aisle.

165
00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:24.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[man] Yes, but that's the seat number
on my ticket.

166
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:28.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's okay. My partner and I need to talk,
works out for both of us.

167
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:33.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really think it's best
if I sat in the seat that's on my ticket.

168
00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:58.115 --> 00:10:59.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

171
00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:02.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

172
00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:04.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Holden] Well, no.

173
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How different is it from this?

174
00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd say it's pretty different.

175
00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:11.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

176
00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:13.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

178
00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:19.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Movies, TV.

179
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:21.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:21.972 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

advertising creates psychos?

181
00:11:24.892 --> 00:11:26.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

183
00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:33.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

185
00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:40.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

211
00:12:48.976 --> 00:12:51.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] We didn't get anything useful
out of that prick.

212
00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:52.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm telling you, you did.

213
00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:56.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe in an academic sense,
but this isn't only about your study.

[Carr] <i>My</i> study?

215
00:12:57.526 --> 00:13:00.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once we've collected all the data,
we can all apply it.

216
00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:01.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mean, in four years?

217
00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:03.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need coffee.

218
00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:12.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The way he lies is very interesting.
-How so?

219
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it's just so exaggerated.

220
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He can't possibly expect you

221
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We called him on a lie,
showed him evidence,

222
00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:19.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:23.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

225
00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:25.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:28.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, Bill,

227
00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:30.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

that this guy's got more to add.

229
00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:38.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You read the story about the girl
he held at knifepoint when he was 15?

230
00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:40.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Made her undress, took pictures,
locked her in a corncrib.

231
00:13:40.569 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then pretended to be his own twin brother.

232
00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:44.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. And he talked all about Jerry.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Maybe.

234
00:13:46.408 --> 00:13:48.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's something about disguise,
pretending to be someone else.

235
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:50.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It gives him room for what?

236
00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said he started blacking out
when his kids were small.

00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:56.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So he isn't averse
to talking about his family.

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:58.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bill, you could talk about your son.

00:13:58.128 --> 00:13:59.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

240
00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:01.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not discussing my son with him.

241
00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you don't have to talk
about your family. You can make one up.

00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:06.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:10.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

cigarettes and pizza. Indulge him.

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:46.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm... she said...

317
00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:50.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
whatever the police wanted her to say.

318
00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you did approach her
dressed as a woman.

319
00:18:54.007 --> 00:18:55.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you married?
-[Tench] Yeah.

320
00:18:55.717 --> 00:18:58.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's your wife's name?
-None of your business.

321
00:18:58.262 --> 00:18:59.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I appreciate honesty.

322
00:19:02.599 --> 00:19:03.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nancy.

323
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:07.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How does Nancy deal with things
that she doesn't understand?

324
00:19:07.896 --> 00:19:09.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't follow.

325
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's just say, my wife...

326
00:19:12.776 --> 00:19:14.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
was less than adventurous.

327
00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:18.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You were young when you got married.
-Twenty-two. She was 17.

328
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What was it about her?
-She popped my cherry.

329
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:22.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] That seems old-fashioned.

330
00:19:22.452 --> 00:19:24.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You married the first girl
you had sex with?

331
00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:27.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It wasn't that unusual in 1961.

332
00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:30.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you had... "interests" by then.

333
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stealing lingerie off of clotheslines.

334
00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:36.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You photographed a neighborhood girl
naked when you were 15.

335
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just a healthy, red-blooded American male.

336
00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:41.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What about the shoes?
-[Brudos] What shoes?

337
00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:43.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In your garage.

338
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The women's shoes.
-Ah.

339
00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The wife loved to shop.

340
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:50.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There were nearly a hundred pairs.
Most of them size 16.

341
00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:53.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Brudos] Ah, those.
Friends sent those to me.

342
00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:54.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Friends?
-That's right.

343
00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:56.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] Why would friends send you shoes?

344
00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:02.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Started as a goof. Got out of hand.

345
00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:03.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's interesting.

346
00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's that?
-Hmm?

347
00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:12.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A reward for honesty.

348
00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:15.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] Come on, Jerry.
Your friends didn't send you those shoes.

349
00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:18.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What can I say, I'm a collector.

350
00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:20.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you wear them?

351
00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:21.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't have to.

352
00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:23.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't have to, to what?

353
00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:26.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You know.
-Get off.

354
00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:27.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's adorable.

355
00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:30.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought wearing them
was part of the allure?

356
00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:35.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why's he so interested?
-I'm really just asking for Darcie.

357
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:38.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She still doesn't get it.
We caught up on the phone.

358
00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right.
-Nice woman.

359
00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My wife...

360
00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:44.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
wouldn't talk about me.

361
00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:45.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ex-wife.

362
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Brudos]
She had to divorce me to protect the kids.

363
00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:48.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And change her last name?

364
00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:53.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure it makes it
easier for them in school.

365
00:20:53.126 --> 00:20:54.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tench] What would they say
to their friends?

366
00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:58.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not just about the murders.
How do you explain the cross-dressing?

367
00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Dad's a tranny? Dad's a fag?"

368
00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:01.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fuck you, man.

369
00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:04.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How does it fucking work with the shoes?

370
00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:07.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He is dying to know.

371
00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:11.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll pass it along to Darcie.
Ten years later, she's still confused.

372
00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:14.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Give her my love.
-I'll do that... Jer.

373
00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:19.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tony! Hey!

374
00:21:19.861 --> 00:21:21.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get in here!
-What are you doing?

375
00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Brudos] Go fuck yourselves.

376
00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:24.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Tench] They're just questions.
-I've had enough.

377
00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:26.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Tony] What's going on?
-[Brudos] I'm done.

378
00:21:26.326 --> 00:21:27.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wait a minute.
-[Brudos] I'm done!

379
00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:29.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bill, tell him.

380
00:21:29.913 --> 00:21:32.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We didn't talk to your stupid wife.
She hung up on us.

381
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] And you're forgetting something.

382
00:21:56.773 --> 00:21:58.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah...

383
00:22:00.068 --> 00:22:01.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Brand new.

384
00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:03.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden]
They're the biggest size they had.

385
00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:13.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should have brought me
a pair of Nancy's.

386
00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:15.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Fuck you.
-[Brudos] Fuck you.

387
00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:30.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So when did it start,
your interest in women's shoes?

388
00:22:30.265 --> 00:22:32.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It didn't start. It was always there.

389
00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:37.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There must have been a moment
during puberty when it became... sexual.

390
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:39.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got my first pair of heels at five.

391
00:22:39.816 --> 00:22:40.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Five?

392
00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:43.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Five years old?
-[Brudos] Stilettos.

393
00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:46.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Found them in the junkyard,
brought 'em home.

394
00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:47.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Why?

395
00:22:47.657 --> 00:22:50.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Never seen anything like 'em before,
except in pictures.

396
00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:52.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't your mom wear heels?

397
00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:53.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never.

398
00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:57.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What'd she think
when you brought them home?

399
00:23:04.966 --> 00:23:07.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One time,
my mom walked in on me jacking off.

400
00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:08.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Came into my bedroom.

401
00:23:09.012 --> 00:23:11.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I hadn't locked the door.
-Really?

402
00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:13.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-What'd she do?

403
00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:16.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd never seen her so shocked.

404
00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:19.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like I was doing something
too horrible to even imagine.

405
00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:20.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She thought I needed help.

406
00:23:21.274 --> 00:23:23.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She offered to help?

407
00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:27.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Psychological help.
-[laughs]

408
00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:31.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-My mom burned the shoes.
-The stilettos?

409
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dragged me into the backyard,

410
00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:36.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
poured kerosene all over 'em, lit 'em up.

411
00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:39.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That must have been memorable.
-She always said she wanted a girl.

412
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:43.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She wanted you to be a girl?

413
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She had my brother,
that's what she wanted next.

414
00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:47.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She told you this?
-All the time.

415
00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:50.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why was she so upset
when you brought home the shoes?

416
00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:52.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was wearing 'em around the house.

417
00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:56.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Holden] Were you trying to be
what she wanted you to be?

418
00:23:56.476 --> 00:23:57.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

419
00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:00.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Were you trying to be a girl?

420
00:24:02.983 --> 00:24:06.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fuck no, I never wanted to be a girl.

421
00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It is not possible to communicate
with someone like Brudos and be fake.

00:32:24.984 --> 00:32:29.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can hassle him or we can open up
to him, but either option has a cost.

00:32:37.163 --> 00:32:38.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She comes highly recommended.

00:32:38.873 --> 00:32:41.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:48.007 --> 00:32:48.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

533
00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:53.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only thing is,
she's in Charlottesville.

00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:56.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I looked for someone in D.C.

535
00:32:56.432 --> 00:32:59.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'd think they'd have
music therapists in D.C.

536
00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:04.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with all the politicians' kids there,
but maybe it's considered too alternative.

I don't know that she's a hippie.
I only talked to her on the phone.

00:33:08.111 --> 00:33:11.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:11.906 --> 00:33:12.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:23.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe even get him out of school
a little early,

543
00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:26.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which could also be a good thing,
after what happened today.

00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:36.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:44.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you have the club.

for a child psychologist in Woodbridge,

00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:51.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

552
00:33:54.949 --> 00:33:56.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About a month ago.

553
00:33:56.659 --> 00:33:57.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

554
00:33:58.369 --> 00:34:00.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I really don't want
to send him to a shrink.

00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:04.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd rather send him to a doctor
than some hippie musician.

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:07.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:08.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:14.761 --> 00:34:16.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

562
00:34:53.633 --> 00:34:54.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

he's gonna get kicked out.

564
00:34:58.387 --> 00:35:00.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's getting bullied,
so he's defending himself.

I've read a couple of books
which recommend music therapy

00:35:15.738 --> 00:35:17.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Communication training."
Is that what the books call it?

570
00:35:20.868 --> 00:35:22.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:57.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:19.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:47.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I'm applying at the mall and--

603
00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:50.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you'd still be able

604
00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:53.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:19.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I should get a safe.

617
00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:30.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is it in the house at all?

618
00:37:31.958 --> 00:37:34.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's work.
I have to bring it home sometimes.

619
00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:36.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That? You have to bring that home?

620
00:37:37.713 --> 00:37:38.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you do with it?

621
00:37:39.674 --> 00:37:41.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Examine it for clues.

622
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:45.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't tell me a thing
about what you do.

623
00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:46.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:52.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, you need to protect your son.

626
00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What was he doing in my office
in the first place?

627
00:37:56.524 --> 00:38:00.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can't watch him every second.
He's always trying to get in there.

628
00:38:00.194 --> 00:38:01.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because he knows it's not allowed.

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:07.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:10.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's putting on your ties.
