00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:23.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:50.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:51.752 --> 00:11:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:14.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:16.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:22.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Our democracy is vanishing into what?

214
00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:23.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:47.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure, but here's the troubling thing:
no one's even asking the questions.

00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:54.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

277
00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:32.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole furniture thing was just a front

527
00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We don't need to get into that.
Forget vernacular.

528
00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:54.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In real life,
people just press their demands.

529
00:34:54.383 --> 00:34:55.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right?

530
00:34:56.385 --> 00:34:57.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um... [clears throat]

531
00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:01.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh... put the gun down, Steve.

532
00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:04.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We brought your children to see you.

533
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You what?

534
00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:10.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my God. I lost custody.
I haven't seen my children in years.

535
00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:12.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Okay, good.

536
00:35:13.694 --> 00:35:17.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Important not to talk to a divorced man
about his children. Different tactic.

537
00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:23.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right, I asked nicely.
Now put the fucking gun down.

538
00:35:23.538 --> 00:35:25.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Mark] What?!

539
00:35:25.915 --> 00:35:27.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm no faggot, motherfucker!

00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:29.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let's dial it back a little.

541
00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me. What is the point of this?

542
00:35:31.879 --> 00:35:33.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Holden] Great question.

543
00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Psychologically preparing you for reality.

544
00:35:35.883 --> 00:35:38.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the reality is,
you have to talk to them.

545
00:35:38.344 --> 00:35:41.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Somebody demands the impossible,
you can't just shoot him.

546
00:35:41.097 --> 00:35:42.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then why have so much firearms training?

547
00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:45.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, because that is a tactical response
for when all else fails.

548
00:35:45.893 --> 00:35:48.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if local law enforcement
can't shut something down,

549
00:35:48.104 --> 00:35:50.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then it has required a tactical response.

550
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, but wouldn't you like
to try something different?

551
00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:55.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or would you rather use firearms
all the time?

552
00:35:57.572 --> 00:35:59.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'd kind of rather use firearms.
-Why?

553
00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:02.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seems safer?

555
00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:09.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Holden, I enjoyed that immensely.
What do you call that?

556
00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:12.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just role-playing
in a simulated hostage situation.

557
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stimulated?
-Simulated.

558
00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:16.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All that profanity,
is that an academic thing?

559
00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:19.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're improvising.
They're learning to create a dialogue.

560
00:36:19.218 --> 00:36:21.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How is all that cursing
creating a dialogue?

561
00:36:21.304 --> 00:36:22.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not really about the cursing.

562
00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:25.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure it's all quite modern
and fashionable in academic circles,

563
00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:28.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it seems very theatrical to me.

564
00:36:28.227 --> 00:36:30.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, in criminal psych,
role-playing exercises

565
00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:32.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
are considered a valuable tool,
with or without the cursing.

566
00:36:32.982 --> 00:36:35.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we have enough exercises here
at the Academy.

567
00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:38.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're going to start
implementing new ones,

568
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:40.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
talk to somebody
in the Behavioral Science Unit.

569
00:36:40.239 --> 00:36:41.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They can help?

570
00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:44.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They can go over the soundness
of the psychology. That's their thing.

571
00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:45.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, good idea.

572
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why don't I set that up?
-Okay.

573
00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, yes.

-Interesting guy.

580
00:37:16.984 --> 00:37:19.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was kind of disturbed by what he said.

581
00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:20.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

584
00:37:33.292 --> 00:37:34.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't smoke when I eat.

00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:36.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

586
00:37:37.713 --> 00:37:39.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't smoke when I don't eat either.

587
00:37:43.844 --> 00:37:46.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So did Shepard talk to you about my thing?

588
00:37:46.389 --> 00:37:47.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He did his best.

589
00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:49.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What does that mean?

00:37:50.142 --> 00:37:52.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I call this place "the country club,"
because, you know,

592
00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:59.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it can be a little starchy sometimes.

593
00:38:00.569 --> 00:38:01.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hear that.

00:38:03.656 --> 00:38:05.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You went back to college, right?

596
00:38:05.866 --> 00:38:06.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
UVA.

597
00:38:07.868 --> 00:38:09.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How old are you, 26, 27?

598
00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:10.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Twenty-nine.

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's interesting.

600
00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:15.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lot of guys your age
don't want to go back to school

601
00:38:15.418 --> 00:38:18.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they feel
it undermines their authority.

602
00:38:18.629 --> 00:38:21.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was hoping
it would give me some authority.

604
00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:28.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, well, I'm there,
so I might as well make myself useful.

605
00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:31.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Most guys don't want to get stuck
doing recruitment.

00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:36.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess I'm busy working my way sideways.

608
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are what they call a "blue flamer."
You know what that is?

609
00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:43.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. What does that mean?

610
00:38:43.612 --> 00:38:44.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're so eager to do good,

611
00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:47.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you have a big, blue flame
shooting out of your asshole.

00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:51.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:54.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just take it slow.
You'll get there in the end.

I'm just trying to be a better instructor.

615
00:39:00.796 --> 00:39:03.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. Well, I was thinking about that.

00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:06.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a couple of years ago.

00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I go on the road and give classes
in various police departments

618
00:39:09.764 --> 00:39:12.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
from Buffalo, New York

619
00:39:12.975 --> 00:39:15.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a million cops out there
who want to know what we know.

00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:19.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I go to them, give them a distillation
of what we teach here,

621
00:39:19.106 --> 00:39:20.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they tell me what they've been doing.

622
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:21.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:39:21.942 --> 00:39:25.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

by getting involved on their level.

00:39:25.988 --> 00:39:27.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

in local law enforcement.

00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:33.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

630
00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:52.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Freud suggests that there's
an innate desire for destruction,

739
00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:36.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
based on the propensity for matter
to return--

00:45:36.942 --> 00:45:38.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What does this have to do with motive?
-[Holden] Well...

741
00:45:39.319 --> 00:45:43.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we've always looked at motive
as need or greed, right?

742
00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:46.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Guy steals a TV to sell it to buy drugs.
-[Holden] Exactly.

743
00:45:46.368 --> 00:45:49.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But let's say, while he's at it,
he steals your wife's panties, too.

744
00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:51.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he stole my wife's panties,
I'd be amazed.

00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:56.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So why does he do it?
Is it merely prurient?

747
00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:58.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He could be motivated by something
he doesn't even understand.

00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:01.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our new quest, like Freud,

749
00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:04.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is to look beyond what we assume
are obvious impulses.

750
00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:06.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So why didn't you just say that?

00:46:14.646 --> 00:46:16.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tench] Don't make it too complicated.

00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:17.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

754
00:46:18.066 --> 00:46:20.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's complicated
and there's too complicated, Holden.

755
00:46:24.156 --> 00:46:27.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We used to do this experiment
in social psychology.

756
00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:28.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh-huh. What was that?

757
00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:32.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You get onto a crowded elevator,
and you face the opposite direction,

758
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the back of the elevator,
and everybody freaks out.

759
00:46:37.044 --> 00:46:40.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're uncomfortable
for reasons they can't even articulate.

760
00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:45.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if you turn around and face the front,
everybody relaxes.

761
00:46:46.386 --> 00:46:49.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Well, how do we do that?

762
00:46:51.934 --> 00:46:53.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do we have in common?

00:46:55.437 --> 00:46:56.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:01.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

766
00:47:10.118 --> 00:47:11.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think we can all agree.

767
00:47:13.622 --> 00:47:15.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
But what do you really know about him?

768
00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:19.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Did you know that his mother
was a jailbird and a prostitute?

769
00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:21.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you know when he was ten years old,

770
00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:24.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she palmed him off
onto his sadistic, Bible-thumping uncle

771
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:28.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who beat him within an inch of his life
and taunted him to act like a man?

772
00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:31.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Charles responded to that
by becoming a pimp

773
00:47:31.557 --> 00:47:34.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and an armed robber,
and was incarcerated for over 20 years,

774
00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:36.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
where he continued to be brutalized.

775
00:47:36.436 --> 00:47:41.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In 1967, he was paroled,
during the Summer of Love.

776
00:47:42.067 --> 00:47:43.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:54.621 --> 00:47:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Here we have a child who was unwanted,
unloved, regularly beaten,

00:47:58.083 --> 00:47:59.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

781
00:47:59.918 --> 00:48:03.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, might this not have had
some sort of an effect on him?

00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:07.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:48:10.262 --> 00:48:12.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:19.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

don't you think?

787
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:23.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:26.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:48:32.826 --> 00:48:36.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the real question is,
how could we not have seen this coming?

792
00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:37.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:39.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

794
00:48:39.124 --> 00:48:42.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was institutionalized

00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:45.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

796
00:48:46.131 --> 00:48:48.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
locking him up his young life
helped make him what he was.

797
00:48:49.051 --> 00:48:50.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

798
00:48:50.844 --> 00:48:53.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They locked him up

799
00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:54.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

800
00:48:54.848 --> 00:48:57.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, guys, I'm not asking anybody
to feel sorry for Charles Manson.

801
00:48:58.018 --> 00:49:00.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he were here, I'd shoot him dead.
No one would stop me.

I was born in New York,
but it's kind of a mixed bag.

952
00:56:35.934 --> 00:56:38.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
