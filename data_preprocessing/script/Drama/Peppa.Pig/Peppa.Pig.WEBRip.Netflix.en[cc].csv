00:12:55.560,00:12:57.560,I was a strongman once.
00:12:57.600,00:13:00.320,I used to lift tractors.

00:14:45.120,00:14:47.960,I think the little trees have grown.
00:14:48.000,00:14:51.800,"Oh, yes. They do all seem big, don't they?"
00:14:51.840,00:14:55.240,How are we going to find the right big tree?

00:16:05.240,00:16:07.640,That goes straight into a blackberry bush.
00:16:10.680,00:16:13.040,It's the way I went when I was a boy.
00:16:13.080,00:16:18.360,"No. If you want to go to the fish pond, you need to go up that path."

00:00:36.680,00:00:40.680,-Why?
00:00:36.680,00:00:42.880,-Grandpa doesn't like slugs and snails because they eat his vegetables.
00:00:42.920,00:00:48.880,"And the best time to find them is at night, with this torch."

00:03:16.480,00:03:21.600,They like the torchlight.
