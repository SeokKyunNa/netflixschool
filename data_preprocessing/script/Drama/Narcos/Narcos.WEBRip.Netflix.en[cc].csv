00:00:47.756,00:00:54.554,"They know where you are, they know who you're talking to, and trust me, they know who you're fucking."
00:00:54.637,00:00:58.391,"You turn on a cell phone or a computer, and you're doomed."
00:00:59.184,00:01:03.605,"But in Colombia in 1989, it wasn't that easy."
00:01:03.688,00:01:05.899,"First off, there was no Internet."
00:01:05.982,00:01:07.400,No cells.
00:01:07.484,00:01:13.490,"The best they had were satellite phones, and in order to capture a satellite phone, you had to fly directly over it."
00:01:13.573,00:01:17.869,"On top of that, the only people who had sat phones were the filthy rich..."
00:01:17.952,00:01:20.330,"the landowners, the politicians..."
00:01:21.706,00:01:25.418,"And lucky for us, the narcos were richer than them all."
00:01:32.342,00:01:34.552,We're going out tonight.
00:01:41.976,00:01:52.320,"That's why back then, the US government developed software that could identify I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz, gentlemen."
00:01:52.403,00:01:55.448,And you guessed it: no GPS either.
00:01:55.532,00:01:57.909,"Hammer, prepare to engage."
00:02:01.496,00:02:05.250,So we had to triangulate their signals using assets on the ground.
00:02:08.461,00:02:11.005,"OK, he's in Modelia. He's on the west side."
00:02:11.089,00:02:13.258,"Hawkeye, how do you copy that?"
00:02:20.098,00:02:21.808,I've got a table ready.
00:02:23.309,00:02:25.436,Show up around midnight.
00:02:28.648,00:02:30.859,but he'd just made himself a date.
00:02:30.942,00:02:34.863,Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad just told us where he's going.
00:02:34.946,00:02:36.823,"Hammer, disengage."
00:02:36.906,00:02:39.200,So who do we give this to? DEA?
00:02:39.284,00:02:42.787,- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña. - Peña's an asshole.
00:02:42.871,00:02:44.956,- I'm gonna give it to the other guy. - Sure.
00:02:49.502,00:02:52.672,"I'm Steve Murphy, Drug Enforcement Agent."
00:02:52.755,00:02:57.302,"And as you can see, I am deeply embedded in Colombia."
00:02:57.385,00:02:58.428,Hello?
00:03:01.055,00:03:01.890,Got it.
00:03:01.973,00:03:04.601,He's meeting Lizard and the rest of them at midnight tonight.
00:03:04.684,00:03:06.019,OK.
00:03:08.771,00:03:12.108,but the DEA is restricted in a foreign country.
00:03:12.191,00:03:16.195,So I did just what you would do... I called the cops.
00:03:16.279,00:03:17.447,Hola.
00:03:21.284,00:03:22.327,All right.
00:03:24.996,00:03:26.331,Guess who that was.
00:03:27.457,00:03:28.666,Your partner.
00:03:29.751,00:03:31.461,He just gave me a great gift.
00:03:32.754,00:03:33.922,Poison.
00:03:38.968,00:03:41.012,Does he know how I'm going to package it?
00:03:41.221,00:03:43.264,"Yeah, sure."
00:03:43.348,00:03:45.475,He's not a fool.
00:03:46.559,00:03:47.769,Gotta go.
00:03:49.187,00:03:51.856,Gonna stick me with the bill?
00:03:55.777,00:03:58.404,Cheap son of a bitch.
00:04:01.199,00:04:04.077,"Javier Peña, my partner."
00:04:04.285,00:04:10.708,"And this is Colonel Carrillo, the leader of the Search Bloc, the unit we helped create to capture the bad guys."
00:04:10.792,00:04:13.586,"Boy, did he have a lot of love for the narcos."
00:04:21.469,00:04:23.304,Especially the local hitmen.
00:04:23.388,00:04:25.139,Colombians call them sicarios.
00:04:33.773,00:04:37.568,Crazy motherfucker who killed dozens of people.
00:04:37.652,00:04:39.112,Probably hundreds.
00:04:39.988,00:04:40.989,But don't get me wrong.
00:04:41.072,00:04:44.325,I would've sent Carrillo there even if Poison never killed a fly.
00:04:45.660,00:04:47.912,I don't have a lot of love for the narcos either.
00:04:56.462,00:04:59.716,We're gonna stop on 14th and go around the corner.
00:04:59.799,00:05:02.844,"Riano, Trujillo, you're in the front with me."
00:05:02.927,00:05:05.138,"- Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear. - Yes, sir."
00:05:05.221,00:05:07.724,"You got it, boys? We're gonna go at it with everything we got."
00:05:07.807,00:05:10.601,"We're gonna kill these fuckers, all right?"
00:05:46.471,00:05:49.140,But don't call me a bad guy just yet.
00:07:19.939,00:07:21.315,My fellow Americans...
00:07:23.818,00:07:27.905,"People forget, but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon."
00:07:28.823,00:07:30.908,We thought he was one of the good guys.
00:07:31.117,00:07:35.997,And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet was a good guy because he hated the commies.
00:07:36.205,00:07:38.666,So we helped Pinochet seize power.
00:07:43.546,00:07:46.883,Then Pinochet turned around and killed thousands of people.
00:07:59.562,00:08:02.190,"But sometimes, bad guys do good things."
00:08:04.692,00:08:12.658,"Nobody knows this, but back in '73, Chile was on its way to being the world's biggest cocaine processing and exporting center."
00:08:21.334,00:08:22.460,to ship the product north.
00:08:22.543,00:08:26.214,"To be productive, you can't waste money! Come on!"
00:08:35.473,00:08:36.474,On the ground!
00:08:44.482,00:08:46.943,"And then, being Pinochet..."
00:08:48.611,00:08:50.029,he had them all killed.
00:08:55.451,00:08:56.869,Aim!
00:08:57.870,00:08:58.871,Ready ammunition!
00:09:18.933,00:09:20.643,I guess they were right.
00:09:23.896,00:09:30.236,"The bullets missed Mateo Moreno, aka Cockroach, and he was smart enough to play dead."
00:09:33.781,00:09:35.449,He wasn't killed on that day.
00:09:37.743,00:09:40.871,"Instead, he won the damn lottery."
00:09:44.208,00:09:47.962,Cockroach had been stealing from his bosses for months.
00:09:48.045,00:09:51.382,Now he was left alone in the world with the perfect product.
00:09:51.465,00:09:54.969,A product whose offer creates its own demand.
00:09:58.514,00:10:01.392,Fucking Pinochet is killing the whole world.
00:10:02.476,00:10:06.939,"- But you're not a communist. - No, not a communist, something worse."
00:10:07.023,00:10:09.358,A drug trafficker.
00:10:09.442,00:10:12.695,"- A drug trafficker? - Yes, a drug trafficker."
00:10:22.204,00:10:25.458,"We didn't know much, but we knew it was some pretty powerful shit."
00:10:25.666,00:10:27.877,"...this will give us better results, OK?"
00:10:27.960,00:10:31.172,Cocaine hijacks the pleasure centers in the brain.
00:10:31.255,00:10:34.467,A rat will choose cocaine over food and water.
00:10:34.550,00:10:40.389,"It would choose cocaine over sleep, over sex... over life itself."
00:10:40.473,00:10:43.601,The human brain isn't quite the same as a rodent's...
00:10:45.603,00:10:47.855,unless we're talking about cocaine.
00:10:54.153,00:10:56.322,Cockroach knew he had the perfect product.
00:10:57.323,00:10:59.659,He just needed to smuggle it to the right markets.
00:11:03.162,00:11:05.873,And the best smugglers in the world were in Colombia.
00:11:05.956,00:11:13.297,"WELCOME TO COLOMBIA Like Goldilocks, he had three options."
00:11:13.381,00:11:16.634,"And pay attention, because all three are important to this story."
00:11:19.929,00:11:24.517,"The Ochoa brothers: Jorge, that's Fabio on the horse."
00:11:30.898,00:11:34.068,...but Cockroach felt the high life had made 'em too soft.
00:11:35.111,00:11:42.785,"Another possible partner was José Rodríguez Gacha, nicknamed The Mexican, for his love of tequila and sombreros."
00:11:42.868,00:11:45.663,He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.
00:11:52.294,00:11:56.132,"Emeralds are a pretty rough trade, even by Colombian standards."
00:11:56.215,00:11:57.716,If you make it to the top...
00:12:13.399,00:12:16.986,Cockroach worried that the emerald trade had made Gacha too hard.
00:12:19.029,00:12:25.619,So he zeroed in on his third option: a man Cockroach knew would be just right.
00:12:32.793,00:12:35.129,The man who would change my life forever.
00:12:37.047,00:12:40.342,Pablo was making a killing in the smuggling business.
00:12:40.426,00:12:42.887,"Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, you name it."
00:12:44.305,00:12:47.766,"At the time, Pablo owned half the police in Medellín."
00:12:49.101,00:12:52.354,But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.
00:12:53.522,00:12:55.649,They didn't play by the same rules.
00:12:59.278,00:13:00.571,Pablo Escobar?
00:13:00.654,00:13:02.072,Where's Felipo?
00:13:02.281,00:13:04.200,Felipo's been arrested.
00:13:04.283,00:13:06.076,Bullshit. Felipo works for me.
00:13:06.160,00:13:09.163,He used to work for you. Now he's going to jail. What do you think about that?
00:13:09.246,00:13:11.665,- Do you know who you're talking to? - Shut the fuck up.
00:13:11.749,00:13:13.876,"- I wasn't talking to you. - Relax, Gustavo, please."
00:13:13.959,00:13:15.544,Show some respect.
00:13:17.713,00:13:19.965,"Now what's the problem, Mr. Jose Luis?"
00:13:22.426,00:13:24.053,How do you know my name?
00:13:24.261,00:13:26.305,You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.
00:13:29.266,00:13:31.018,And that's Nacho Ibarra.
00:13:34.063,00:13:38.067,"There's Garcia, Lopez..."
00:13:40.277,00:13:41.403,- That's Pinilla. - Yeah.
00:13:41.487,00:13:42.988,Pinilla...
00:13:43.072,00:13:44.907,and with Phillipe is Esparanza.
00:13:44.990,00:13:47.076,I don't give a rat's ass. Open the fucking trucks.
00:13:47.159,00:13:48.702,I don't have all day.
00:13:53.040,00:13:54.500,Open it.
00:14:03.926,00:14:05.553,"Tell me something, Mr. Escobar."
00:14:06.637,00:14:08.347,Who the fuck do you think you are?
00:14:08.430,00:14:11.850,You don't even bother to hide your contraband.
00:14:11.934,00:14:13.727,"Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel."
00:14:13.811,00:14:15.521,"Oh, yeah? You don't say."
00:14:15.604,00:14:17.398,Where are your import papers?
00:14:18.399,00:14:20.734,You need papers for these TV sets.
00:14:20.818,00:14:22.236,Take them.
00:14:23.946,00:14:29.034,"Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not Medellín police making a shit salary."
00:14:29.118,00:14:31.453,"- Look, brother, it's not for you. - Then who?"
00:14:31.537,00:14:33.330,It's for Carlitos.
00:14:34.039,00:14:35.374,Your son.
00:14:37.543,00:14:40.254,Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?
00:14:42.423,00:14:43.757,"Hey, Pinilla!"
00:14:45.968,00:14:49.138,"Your daughter just got her driver's license, right?"
00:14:49.221,00:14:55.144,I've got some car stereo systems in there that are really cool. Real nice.
00:14:56.270,00:15:00.441,"That friend of yours, Lopez... he's got a wife that's really beautiful."
00:15:04.028,00:15:05.821,"Your wife is gorgeous, brother."
00:15:06.739,00:15:08.782,What's she doing with a guy like you?
00:15:15.331,00:15:17.625,"I think she deserves some jewelry, no?"
00:15:19.835,00:15:22.838,Why don't I have my boys drop off a few gifts?
00:15:26.926,00:15:29.428,"Colonel, how is your mom doing?"
00:15:29.511,00:15:32.681,"- She just got out of the hospital, right? - Yes, she's feeling better."
00:15:37.186,00:15:38.479,Gentlemen...
00:15:39.563,00:15:41.732,I'm going to tell you who I am.
00:15:42.942,00:15:46.111,I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
00:15:47.196,00:15:49.490,My eyes are everywhere.
00:15:49.698,00:15:54.703,That means you guys can't move a finger in all of Antioquia without me knowing about it.
00:15:54.954,00:15:57.873,Do you understand? Not a finger.
00:16:00.250,00:16:04.713,"One day, I'm going to be President of the Republic of Colombia."
00:16:05.714,00:16:09.843,"So look, I make deals for a living."
00:16:09.927,00:16:13.472,"Now, you can stay calm and accept my deal..."
00:16:14.390,00:16:16.809,or accept the consequences.
00:16:20.479,00:16:21.814,Silver...
00:16:23.649,00:16:25.025,or lead.
00:16:26.527,00:16:28.070,You decide.
00:17:26.920,00:17:29.423,"No, no, no. Cockroach to my friends."
00:17:31.508,00:17:35.971,and I think this business can make us a lot of money.
00:17:36.055,00:17:37.431,Explain.
00:17:37.514,00:17:40.559,Well... I get the paste in Peru.
00:17:40.642,00:17:45.272,"I will handle the chemical part of production, and all the other details in producing this exquisite white powder."
00:17:45.355,00:17:47.775,What I need from you is to help me get it into Colombia.
00:17:51.445,00:17:55.282,"In Chile, this little thing costs ten bucks a gram."
00:17:55.491,00:17:59.119,"- They sell it by grams? - Yes, it's very good. Look..."
00:17:59.203,00:18:04.416,"You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes, you want to do some more."
00:18:04.625,00:18:06.001,Also...
00:18:06.919,00:18:09.421,it's a digestive aid. It makes you want to take a shit.
00:18:09.505,00:18:12.049,"It's very clean, this stuff. Want some?"
00:18:13.425,00:18:20.307,"If this is really that good and we can make some money, We can sell it in Bogotá, Barranquilla, Cali, Cartagena..."
00:18:20.516,00:18:22.768,We're going to be rich.
00:18:22.851,00:18:25.604,- What did you say your name was? - Cockroach.
00:18:27.397,00:18:29.066,"Well look, Cuca..."
00:18:30.025,00:18:32.069,"you don't have any vision, my friend."
00:18:34.863,00:18:37.074,If it costs ten dollars a gram here...
00:18:38.117,00:18:41.328,imagine how much it will sell for in Miami.
00:18:48.877,00:18:51.672,Rodrigo! One more.
00:19:17.614,00:19:20.492,"I signed up for the sand, surf and women."
00:19:22.202,00:19:25.414,"In '79, the bad guys I was chasing wore flip-flops."
00:19:26.874,00:19:30.878,"I was a young DEA agent, partnered with my buddy, Kevin Brady."
00:19:32.087,00:19:34.131,Kevin was a little slow afoot.
00:19:38.886,00:19:41.763,What you got? What is this? Huh?
00:19:41.847,00:19:42.764,What is that?
00:19:42.848,00:19:45.976,That right there... that's a goddamn promotion.
00:19:48.353,00:19:49.813,- Whoo! - Look at that.
00:19:57.404,00:19:58.572,How much money you owe me?
00:19:58.780,00:20:00.407,What happened to the money you owed me last week?
00:20:00.532,00:20:02.117,"That's right, that's right."
00:20:04.703,00:20:07.706,"All right. All right, who do we pick?"
00:20:07.915,00:20:09.416,How 'bout her?
00:20:09.499,00:20:10.918,"No, no, no, we gotta fuck with him."
00:20:11.001,00:20:13.003,"- Yeah, let's mess with his head. - Um..."
00:20:13.086,00:20:14.922,"Oh, right there. See her? At the bar?"
00:20:15.005,00:20:17.132,"- Which one? - Blue top, blond hair. That's his type."
00:20:20.385,00:20:21.678,- All right. - Whoo!
00:20:23.972,00:20:27.809,"Hey, while you were walking back, she was checking your ass out."
00:20:27.893,00:20:29.436,"Oh, she was checking out your ass."
00:20:29.519,00:20:30.938,Get the fuck outta here. Come on.
00:20:34.983,00:20:37.653,She was. She was eye-fucking you. The entire time.
00:20:41.490,00:20:44.076,- Uh-huh. That's his type. - Talking about the blond one?
00:20:44.159,00:20:45.702,"No, the other one. Of course the blond one."
00:20:45.786,00:20:47.496,She's the hottest one there. She's your type.
00:20:54.503,00:20:55.879,"Fuck it, I'm going in."
00:20:59.091,00:21:00.592,"get us another pitcher, will ya?"
00:21:00.801,00:21:03.804,- Pace yourself. - Look at him. Look at his swagger.
00:21:13.939,00:21:15.315,How you doing?
00:21:16.149,00:21:17.150,Busy.
00:21:18.777,00:21:22.281,"I just said, Look, if you don't wanna be there, you don't have to be."
00:21:31.707,00:21:34.042,But I couldn't let it end like that.
00:21:38.255,00:21:39.548,"Uh, they're fucking with me."
00:21:39.631,00:21:43.093,"Telling me you were checking out my ass, and who checks out a cop's ass, right?"
00:21:43.176,00:21:44.428,You're a cop?
00:21:44.511,00:21:46.847,"Not a cop, actually. I'm DEA."
00:21:47.055,00:21:48.098,Drug Enforcement?
00:21:48.181,00:21:50.183,So you're the one making pot more expensive.
00:21:53.645,00:21:56.231,"I wanna show these guys up. Why don't you, uh..."
00:21:56.315,00:21:58.025,give me your phone number?
00:21:58.859,00:22:00.444,How about a fake number?
00:22:01.528,00:22:02.529,That'll work.
00:22:03.363,00:22:05.073,"Hey, buddy, you got a pen?"
00:22:19.755,00:22:22.341,- I'm sorry for the trouble. - Sure.
00:22:23.258,00:22:24.843,Have a good night.
00:22:32.642,00:22:35.312,"- Where's the pitcher at? - The pitcher? Oh, I..."
00:22:36.021,00:22:37.481,I didn't make it back with the pitcher.
00:22:37.689,00:22:40.942,I just came up with this and I couldn't read it. What does that say?
00:22:41.026,00:22:43.487,- Read it and weep! - Aw... Gimme that.
00:22:43.570,00:22:45.238,How much did that cost you?
00:22:45.322,00:22:47.449,- That's your handwriting. - It's not my handwriting!
00:22:56.625,00:23:00.045,"Worst that could happen, I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca."
00:23:06.426,00:23:07.636,Hello?
00:23:09.137,00:23:10.597,So it wasn't a fake.
00:23:10.806,00:23:13.141,I thought you might figure it out.
00:23:13.225,00:23:15.644,"After all, you're DEA."
00:23:20.524,00:23:27.447,"The minute Pablo laid his eyes on the paste-processing labs in Peru, cocaine had him."
00:23:31.952,00:23:34.538,"These are my friends, Pablo and Gustavo."
00:23:35.622,00:23:38.041,Would you like a little coffee?
00:23:38.125,00:23:39.751,"Yeah, a coffee?"
00:23:39.835,00:23:40.836,"Yes, a coffee."
00:23:40.919,00:23:42.003,"- How about you, Pablo? - No."
00:23:43.713,00:23:47.843,"My factory is small, but highly productive."
00:23:47.926,00:23:52.806,"Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to use children because of their tiny feet."
00:23:54.975,00:23:56.560,Little magic leaves.
00:24:06.528,00:24:11.616,"Then you cut it, and mix it with gasoline."
00:24:11.700,00:24:15.704,"Then, basically, you pull the merchandise out of the liquid."
00:24:15.787,00:24:17.622,"Let it dry, dry, dry."
00:24:25.172,00:24:27.424,Here is the prize.
00:24:27.507,00:24:29.926,It's like the kitchen in your house.
00:24:34.848,00:24:38.018,Only a much better cake than you've ever had.
00:24:40.187,00:24:42.314,"Look, an old press, an antique."
00:24:46.776,00:24:49.905,Now we put it in the oven.
00:24:49.988,00:24:52.616,Here's one. The other will follow.
00:24:52.699,00:24:55.785,"All natural, organic and healthy. Very good."
00:24:59.122,00:25:02.584,- we'll take a kilo. - A whole kilo. Perfect.
00:25:05.962,00:25:07.380,We'll take five.
00:25:11.468,00:25:13.345,That's Gustavo's department.
00:25:21.144,00:25:26.066,"I was taking a look at it, and the best place to hide the merchandise would be under the rear wheel well."
00:25:26.149,00:25:28.276,It's 22 and one half horsepower.
00:25:28.360,00:25:29.694,Is this easy to take off?
00:25:29.778,00:25:32.489,Don't worry about that shit. I'll stick five kilos in there easy.
00:25:32.572,00:25:34.950,"All right, all right. I'll take three cars, please."
00:25:35.033,00:25:37.994,"- Sure, when do you need them? - Now, brother."
00:25:38.787,00:25:41.665,"All right, we'll take the cars and head back to the lab."
00:25:41.748,00:25:43.917,Why the fuck are we going back to the lab?
00:25:44.000,00:25:49.172,Because there are four wheel wells per car and that's 20 kilos.
00:25:51.549,00:25:54.886,"So if it's nine dollars profit per gram, what?"
00:25:54.970,00:25:56.513,"$9,000 per kilo."
00:25:56.596,00:25:59.140,"$9,000 times 60... The profit is $540,000."
00:26:01.518,00:26:03.353,"- Do you know how to drive, Cockroach? - Yeah."
00:26:09.192,00:26:12.320,using the same smuggling routes he always used.
00:26:15.115,00:26:16.908,Easiest money he ever made.
00:26:22.247,00:26:25.166,"Back in Medellín, Pablo didn't waste any time."
00:26:25.250,00:26:32.048,He bought a house in his old neighborhood and opened his first lab to turn Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.
00:26:36.511,00:26:38.471,All this smells like shit to me.
00:26:38.555,00:26:42.100,What an ignorant bastard. It's like French cheese.
00:26:42.183,00:26:44.519,"The stinkier, the better."
00:26:45.186,00:26:46.438,All right.
00:26:47.480,00:26:49.274,What about all these lights?
00:26:50.859,00:26:53.361,"Is that to tip off the cops, or what?"
00:26:53.445,00:26:57.782,Just worry about transporting the stuff and selling it.
00:26:57.866,00:27:00.785,"I'm the artist here, clear?"
00:27:00.869,00:27:02.078,Clear.
00:27:02.162,00:27:04.205,- Right? - Yeah. Mm-mm.
00:27:08.752,00:27:12.505,"But make no mistake, it would change Medellín forever."
00:27:21.389,00:27:24.517,Don't you think the workers will choke with all that smoke?
00:27:44.204,00:27:47.665,"If this business makes so much money, why are you sending me coach?"
00:27:47.749,00:27:49.793,We just started up. We have to be careful with money.
00:27:49.876,00:27:53.129,"- Don't be a dick. - No, no, don't give me that dumb shit."
00:27:53.213,00:27:56.716,- Come on. - How much can a first class ticket cost?
00:28:10.230,00:28:13.650,"- Around five kilos, honey. - That much?"
00:28:13.733,00:28:15.151,"Trust me, Pablito."
00:28:15.235,00:28:17.195,I love it. Let's do it.
00:28:20.615,00:28:23.201,"- Pablo. - Thank you, my love."
00:28:26.246,00:28:27.539,It's Gustavo.
00:28:28.415,00:28:29.749,"Five kilos, right?"
00:28:33.461,00:28:35.880,He was a family man till the end.
00:28:35.964,00:28:39.134,The guy they got to wear the jacket was the Lion.
00:28:39.217,00:28:41.052,"- Meet my friend. - Hello, how are you doing?"
00:28:41.136,00:28:42.262,"Hey, Pablo, this is Lion."
00:28:45.557,00:28:47.892,"Says he wants to fly first class. It's not like we're rich, right?"
00:28:47.976,00:28:49.978,Pablo Escobar Gaviria. How are you?
00:28:50.061,00:28:51.604,"- Lion. - Pleased to meet you, Lion."
00:28:51.688,00:28:52.939,Here's three.
00:28:53.022,00:28:55.650,"We're going to need two more, right, Mom?"
00:28:57.610,00:29:00.029,"make sure it is not you who wears it, OK?"
00:29:03.450,00:29:05.201,Try it on.
00:29:05.285,00:29:06.494,Come here.
00:29:06.578,00:29:08.371,That's it.
00:29:08.455,00:29:09.873,"Good, right?"
00:29:12.417,00:29:13.460,One...
00:29:14.711,00:29:16.838,"- two... - Wow, it holds a lot!"
00:29:16.921,00:29:18.381,...three.
00:29:20.175,00:29:22.218,- Two more. - Got it. I'll be right back.
00:29:22.302,00:29:23.970,"He looks really handsome, doesn't he?"
00:29:27.015,00:29:30.602,"Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust the jacket a little bit here in the back?"
00:29:30.685,00:29:32.187,- Aah! - Listen to this guy.
00:29:32.270,00:29:34.355,"He looks very handsome, son."
00:29:44.866,00:29:46.201,Welcome to the United States.
00:29:46.284,00:29:48.953,Thank you. Have a great day.
00:29:49.037,00:29:49.913,"Next, please."
00:29:53.875,00:29:58.755,"half Colombian, half German, and 100 percent playboy."
00:29:58.838,00:30:02.133,Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.
00:30:02.217,00:30:04.010,Go figure.
00:30:04.093,00:30:09.682,"Back in '79, this piece of work was flying bales of grass up from Colombia on a fleet of small planes."
00:30:11.768,00:30:13.812,- Welcome. - Thanks a lot. How are ya?
00:30:13.895,00:30:15.396,- Everything good? - Everything's good.
00:30:15.480,00:30:17.106,Whoo! It's so hot.
00:30:17.190,00:30:19.067,What the hell are you doing with a jacket on?
00:30:19.150,00:30:20.527,"You like my jacket, brother?"
00:30:20.610,00:30:23.738,"I got it in Colombia and look, it has a little gift."
00:30:26.449,00:30:28.368,"I was in jail for a while, remember?"
00:30:29.369,00:30:32.497,I saw this shit there. It's pure poison.
00:30:32.580,00:30:35.375,What you got there is the perfect product.
00:30:35.458,00:30:37.919,Pablo says the gringos will fall in love with this shit.
00:30:40.922,00:30:41.965,"Yes, sir."
00:30:45.677,00:30:46.845,Here you go.
00:30:48.304,00:30:50.431,Go on. There are five kilos.
00:30:51.224,00:30:52.267,Where are you going?
00:30:52.517,00:30:54.936,"I'm gonna get another jacket, brother."
00:30:55.019,00:30:57.355,"We'll meet at the same time tomorrow, all right?"
00:31:04.320,00:31:06.614,"Drugs in, cash out."
00:31:06.823,00:31:09.951,And the rich and famous in Miami snorted every single gram of it.
00:31:10.034,00:31:13.496,"And in no time, Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks."
00:31:14.622,00:31:19.627,"Gustavo had the trucks filled to the brim with potatoes, the major item Colombia imported from Peru."
00:31:20.670,00:31:22.714,He didn't even have to bribe the cops.
00:31:23.798,00:31:26.342,The coke paste was hidden in the spare tires.
00:31:26.426,00:31:28.887,Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.
00:31:28.970,00:31:32.765,"Ten trucks, 20 kilos each, going back and forth every day..."
00:31:32.849,00:31:36.936,You do the math. No way the Lion could transport it all.
00:31:37.020,00:31:41.566,"Pretty soon, the Lion had to come up with new ways to smuggle the drug to Miami."
00:31:44.360,00:31:50.325,"You guys are pilots, so you can get this stuff by without a problem."
00:31:51.868,00:31:56.247,"Look, it's $150,000 per kilo, so whatever you want."
00:31:57.874,00:31:59.292,We'll take four.
00:31:59.375,00:32:00.835,"All right, much better."
00:32:00.919,00:32:05.632,Take these two and tell Jairo to give you two more. All right?
00:32:05.715,00:32:08.760,- All right. - Perfect. Thank you very much.
00:32:08.843,00:32:10.386,- See you later. - Later.
00:32:11.804,00:32:13.097,"Come in, please."
00:32:18.227,00:32:20.980,"Look, here are the packets."
00:32:21.064,00:32:24.651,You take a packet... you dip it in the oil and swallow it.
00:32:24.734,00:32:26.027,"Easy, right?"
00:32:26.110,00:32:28.655,"You swallow 50, and I pay you $10,000."
00:32:28.738,00:32:29.822,All right?
00:32:29.906,00:32:31.991,"But with you two, we have a problem."
00:32:32.075,00:32:33.993,"You girls are pregnant, right?"
00:32:34.077,00:32:38.706,"That's good, because US Customs won't search pregnant women."
00:32:38.790,00:32:43.628,You two can easily swallow 70 instead of 50.
00:32:43.711,00:32:46.839,"And I'll pay you $15,000 to help you with the kids."
00:32:46.923,00:32:49.384,All right? All right. Perfect.
00:32:53.388,00:32:55.223,had several mules on them.
00:32:55.306,00:32:57.392,They didn't even know about each other.
00:32:57.475,00:32:59.060,And you know what?
00:32:59.143,00:33:03.272,"Getting in was easy, because nobody worried about cocaine in America."
00:33:03.356,00:33:05.316,All we cared about was grass.
00:33:08.403,00:33:12.907,"Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in almost every legitimate Colombian export."
00:33:12.991,00:33:17.036,"Fish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses... anything."
00:33:34.178,00:33:36.097,But even that didn't do it.
00:33:36.973,00:33:41.436,The real game changer was filling Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.
00:33:46.733,00:33:49.318,I don't know. He was in prison in the United States.
00:33:49.402,00:33:52.488,"- So is he gay or what? - Oh, for sure he's gay."
00:33:52.572,00:33:54.198,But he's got good routes.
00:33:59.996,00:34:01.372,"Gustavo Gaviria, nice to meet you."
00:34:01.456,00:34:02.707,- Nice to meet you. - My cousin.
00:34:02.790,00:34:04.625,Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria. Nice to meet you.
00:34:04.709,00:34:07.712,- Cousin? Nice to meet you. - How was your flight?
00:34:07.795,00:34:09.297,Smooth.
00:34:09.380,00:34:10.631,Let's get down to business.
00:34:10.715,00:34:14.594,The Lion tells us you've been transporting a lot of marijuana in your plane.
00:34:14.677,00:34:17.930,- That's true. - About how much per flight?
00:34:18.723,00:34:20.725,- How far? - Miami.
00:34:27.273,00:34:29.025,Counting the gasoline.
00:34:37.825,00:34:38.951,Carlos...
00:34:45.083,00:34:52.256,"What if we take out the seats, the carpet and all the other crap and only leave space for the pilot? Can you fit more?"
00:34:52.340,00:34:54.092,"We'll leave the engine, right?"
00:34:56.969,00:34:59.388,About... 300 more.
00:35:00.139,00:35:04.435,"All right then, Mr. Carlos. Let's take a walk."
00:35:08.940,00:35:14.028,Pablo was establishing the first dedicated narco routes from Colombia to America.
00:35:15.363,00:35:18.699,"It was a real milestone in the story of narcotics, folks."
00:35:19.700,00:35:24.455,Then Pablo closed The Kitchen and started opening cocaine labs in the middle of the jungle.
00:35:27.125,00:35:34.590,"Under the canopy cover of the Colombian rainforest, he could expand his production capability indefinitely without anybody noticing it."
00:35:45.893,00:35:49.147,"Best asses in the world, believe me."
00:35:49.230,00:35:51.732,"No, I'm not feeling well."
00:35:51.816,00:35:53.359,"- What's up, Cuca? - Hello."
00:35:54.235,00:35:55.319,"Hey, Gustavo."
00:35:56.279,00:35:58.781,What the fuck is up with you guys?
00:35:58.865,00:36:01.534,You're flying around in planes...
00:36:01.617,00:36:08.416,"- while I'm rotting here in this jungle? - Look, Cuca-- Look, let us explain what we have to-- Wait."
00:36:08.499,00:36:11.794,"From now on, in all of my labs..."
00:36:11.878,00:36:16.465,"I'll build a large house with air-conditioning, with a pool..."
00:36:19.051,00:36:21.470,- Just for you. - One problem.
00:36:21.554,00:36:25.474,These are my labs. Mm?
00:36:31.355,00:36:35.568,Relax. No one's arguing with you.
00:36:35.651,00:36:38.070,Come show me the production and we'll talk later.
00:36:41.490,00:36:45.161,"They were violent, crazy and filthy rich."
00:36:45.244,00:36:48.456,"Guys used to getting what they want, one way or another."
00:36:52.335,00:36:56.505,Now I ask myself... if I should get involved with this.
00:36:56.589,00:36:58.549,"What do you think, Pablo?"
00:36:58.633,00:37:01.010,I heard the potato business is like the egg business.
00:37:01.219,00:37:02.762,I wouldn't get involved.
00:37:02.845,00:37:06.098,"Look, man, I took a good look at the market."
00:37:06.307,00:37:08.434,Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.
00:37:08.517,00:37:12.897,- Of course. Same old contraband routes. - Mm.
00:37:12.980,00:37:19.695,"Be careful, guys. If we all start buying potatoes at the same time, the Peruvians will raise the price."
00:37:21.197,00:37:23.699,They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.
00:37:23.783,00:37:27.203,We can reduce the cost of the refining process if we buy together.
00:37:27.286,00:37:32.041,"Well, guys, the hard part is getting the merchandise to Miami."
00:37:32.250,00:37:36.504,You need a lot of creativity for that.
00:37:37.296,00:37:40.758,How much would you charge us to be creative?
00:37:40.841,00:37:44.637,"You deliver the product to me, labeled."
00:37:44.720,00:37:48.266,I will take it to Miami and deliver it to your contact there.
00:37:48.349,00:37:50.935,"Better yet, Lehder will do it."
00:37:51.018,00:37:58.693,"I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value, but I'll insure the safety of your load up to 50 percent of the value."
00:37:58.776,00:38:02.446,The potato business is ours. We don't need-- Deal?
00:38:05.700,00:38:06.867,Deal.
00:38:07.576,00:38:09.161,Sounds good to me.
00:38:10.621,00:38:18.254,"All right, I will create my own routes and stop using your services as soon as possible. OK?"
00:38:21.299,00:38:22.675,Partners?
00:38:26.762,00:38:29.557,We know your policy toward partners.
00:38:31.142,00:38:32.810,Let's just call us...
00:38:33.060,00:38:34.645,friendly associates.
00:38:36.480,00:38:37.940,To Miami.
00:39:01.005,00:39:04.717,"And before long, we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day."
00:39:07.928,00:39:10.264,We thought we were making a huge difference.
00:39:16.520,00:39:19.273,"Truth is, we weren't even making a dent."
00:39:20.566,00:39:23.527,They let us have 60 so they could bring in 600.
00:39:33.079,00:39:34.955,Pablo's coke flooded in.
00:39:35.998,00:39:38.501,It didn't take long for Miami to get addicted.
00:39:38.584,00:39:40.044,And I mean that.
00:39:40.878,00:39:44.298,It was like the whole city was running around trying to get this shit.
00:39:45.800,00:39:47.301,And with the money...
00:39:48.386,00:39:50.262,came the violence.
00:39:52.515,00:39:57.186,"The hippies had been replaced by Colombians, and these guys didn't wear flip-flops."
00:40:20.709,00:40:24.171,The Miami coroner said Colombians were like Dixie cups.
00:40:25.756,00:40:28.092,"Use 'em once, then throw 'em away."
00:40:29.510,00:40:33.597,The Dade County morgue couldn't fit all the bodies from the drug war.
00:40:33.681,00:40:38.602,They had to rent a refrigerated truck from a local company to hold all the extra corpses.
00:40:40.813,00:40:42.648,That was the first person I ever shot.
00:40:43.649,00:40:46.110,A teenager not old enough to buy a six-pack.
00:41:05.838,00:41:08.924,Hey... it was self-defense.
00:41:09.133,00:41:12.094,- Kevin called you? - He's worried about you.
00:41:13.012,00:41:15.097,Did he forget to tell you the kid was 17?
00:41:16.098,00:41:17.725,"He sells drugs, right?"
00:41:19.143,00:41:21.020,"- Yeah. - Yeah, then fuck him."
00:41:28.027,00:41:29.320,What happened?
00:41:35.409,00:41:37.495,when we got hit with the lights and sirens.
00:41:37.578,00:41:38.913,Stay with me.
00:41:39.121,00:41:40.581,I have an unconscious pregnant female.
00:41:40.789,00:41:44.668,Paramedics said she collapsed after she got off her flight.
00:41:44.877,00:41:48.214,"By the time she got to us, she was barely breathing."
00:41:54.678,00:41:58.390,"...but she had no residue on her nostrils, no injection marks."
00:42:00.809,00:42:02.603,We did everything we could.
00:42:03.687,00:42:05.314,She died in the ER.
00:42:07.691,00:42:09.485,We tried to save the baby...
00:42:14.990,00:42:17.034,The baby died in my hands.
00:42:19.787,00:42:21.288,I'm so sorry.
00:42:22.039,00:42:25.042,She was body-packing 11 ounces of cocaine.
00:42:25.960,00:42:27.670,Two of the pellets split open.
00:42:35.511,00:42:37.221,No one survives that.
00:42:48.357,00:42:52.069,I spent all this time waiting around for him.
00:42:52.152,00:42:54.321,"Tell me something, Cockroach."
00:42:54.405,00:42:57.032,Did you ever think you were going to have this much money?
00:43:00.703,00:43:05.666,"If it wasn't for me, you two would still be smuggling cigarettes."
00:43:05.749,00:43:07.543,Let me give you a piece of advice.
00:43:09.128,00:43:11.005,Never say that to Pablo.
00:43:11.880,00:43:14.091,He's not as forgiving as I am.
00:43:22.391,00:43:25.644,But Cockroach should've listened to Gustavo.
00:43:25.728,00:43:29.607,"Instead, he found another way to get his fair share."
00:43:45.372,00:43:47.458,What do you have in the spare tires?
00:43:50.252,00:43:53.631,"390 kilos, Pablo. We lost it."
00:43:54.715,00:43:57.968,"Gustavo, what do you mean we lost it?"
00:43:58.052,00:43:59.928,"Just what I said, we lost it."
00:44:01.013,00:44:06.143,We lost it? It just disappeared? Into thin air or what?
00:44:06.226,00:44:09.271,"Don't mess with me, Pablo. We lost it."
00:44:09.355,00:44:12.650,It looks like the cops must have stopped the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.
00:44:13.942,00:44:15.069,Look...
00:44:16.070,00:44:21.367,we've paid every cop from here to Ipsalia.
00:44:23.327,00:44:25.371,"So how did we lose a load, brother?"
00:44:25.454,00:44:28.832,It looks like Colonel Herrera suddenly turned honest.
00:44:28.916,00:44:30.417,Know what I mean?
00:44:36.090,00:44:37.758,And how much is he asking?
00:44:38.967,00:44:40.344,Too much.
00:44:46.392,00:44:47.893,What are you going to do?
00:44:49.228,00:44:50.604,"Come back, Pablo."
00:44:52.106,00:44:55.025,Don't go and risk it for this asshole. Come back.
00:44:55.109,00:44:56.777,"Where are you going, Pablo?"
00:44:57.486,00:44:58.737,Pablo?
00:45:49.455,00:45:50.873,"What's going on, brother?"
00:45:52.875,00:45:54.209,Mr. Escobar...
00:45:55.586,00:45:58.589,- we need to renegotiate. - Eat shit.
00:46:03.427,00:46:06.221,Eat. Shit.
00:46:09.099,00:46:10.809,What if I shot you in the head?
00:46:31.413,00:46:34.374,He hasn't stopped laughing since we arrested him.
00:46:38.879,00:46:40.839,What's that faggot gonna do?
00:46:45.928,00:46:47.721,"No, lower, lower."
00:46:47.804,00:46:49.139,No that low.
00:46:51.683,00:46:53.310,Ready.
00:46:57.773,00:46:59.775,"Another one, another one. I'm ready."
00:47:06.532,00:47:10.285,...but this mug shot was gonna cause him a lot of grief down the line.
00:47:24.550,00:47:26.093,"Sit down, Mr. Pablo."
00:47:32.432,00:47:35.227,We counted more than 300 kilos in those trucks.
00:47:37.145,00:47:42.150,"That's a street value of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar."
00:47:42.901,00:47:45.320,"And you only gave us $150,000."
00:47:46.863,00:47:49.449,"Well, that's what we agreed upon."
00:47:50.409,00:47:52.494,You know something?
00:47:52.578,00:47:55.622,I make deals for a living.
00:47:55.706,00:48:00.752,Now you can either accept my deal or accept the consequences. You decide.
00:48:04.464,00:48:10.262,"Or we can renegotiate, come to an agreement, and everyone goes home happy."
00:48:12.806,00:48:13.932,Deal?
00:48:22.107,00:48:24.484,I'll give you one million dollars...
00:48:25.986,00:48:28.071,under one condition.
00:48:29.698,00:48:30.991,What is it?
00:48:33.076,00:48:36.955,Someone in my organization gave you the street value of my cocaine.
00:48:38.123,00:48:40.334,"Otherwise, how would you know?"
00:48:44.171,00:48:46.256,Give me a name...
00:48:48.467,00:48:51.637,and you won't have to split the cash with him.
00:48:58.852,00:49:05.776,"Not only did he sell Pablo to the authorities, he was stealing from him all along and selling his coke in Miami, too."
00:49:07.819,00:49:15.869,"Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata, a Colombian with a plumbing business that served as a front for his cocaine operation."
00:49:17.037,00:49:21.792,He had 1200 keys in the van... and guess who was buying the load?
00:49:25.087,00:49:29.841,"The plan was to trade vehicles, and Zapata would be arrested once he left the port."
00:49:31.468,00:49:34.054,1200 kilos.
00:49:34.137,00:49:36.973,That would get us on the cover of the Miami Herald.
00:49:38.058,00:49:40.560,"OK, gringos."
00:49:40.644,00:49:42.646,How's the plumbing business?
00:49:42.729,00:49:44.064,Fine.
00:49:52.322,00:49:54.449,"Come on, amigo. I'll show you."
00:49:57.786,00:50:02.666,"Like I said, amigo... 100 percent pure."
00:50:15.011,00:50:17.639,Don't move! Don't move.
00:50:20.934,00:50:22.227,Get down!
00:50:28.066,00:50:29.151,Don't look at me.
00:50:53.467,00:51:06.521,"In the case of the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz, after taking into account all due considerations, bail has been set at two million dollars, or a bond of $200,000."
00:51:11.276,00:51:14.362,My testimony was gonna put that bastard on death row.
00:51:16.239,00:51:24.831,"The US District Attorney said La Quica met his bail of two million dollars, paid by a wire transfer from, well... why don't you take a guess?"
00:51:26.082,00:51:29.377,La Quica boarded and was back in Medellín by midnight.
00:51:32.172,00:51:38.512,"From '79 to '84, there were 3,245 murders in Miami."
00:51:39.596,00:51:44.309,"And outside the Tourist Bureau and the cops, no one much cared about that."
00:51:44.518,00:51:48.855,What got the US government to take notice was the money.
00:51:48.939,00:51:53.485,"Billions of dollars a year, all flowing from the US to Colombia."
00:51:54.486,00:51:57.572,And that... America couldn't take.
00:51:59.157,00:52:03.411,A group of powerful businessmen went and met with President Reagan.
00:52:03.620,00:52:07.666,They were terrified the narco economy would sink the real economy of Miami.
00:52:08.583,00:52:13.046,Or... maybe they were pissed off that they weren't getting a cut.
00:52:13.129,00:52:16.550,"Whatever it was, the businessmen came at just the right time."
00:52:17.259,00:52:19.469,It's back-to-school time for America's children...
00:52:23.765,00:52:26.184,Drugs are menacing our society.
00:52:26.268,00:52:29.813,They're threatening our values and undercutting our institutions.
00:52:29.896,00:52:31.982,They're killing our children.
00:52:33.942,00:52:36.862,"Folksy, direct and tough."
00:52:36.945,00:52:40.198,He vowed to go after drugs at the source.
00:52:40.407,00:52:42.617,But it was Nancy who stole the show.
00:52:42.701,00:52:46.913,"So to my young friends out there, life can be great."
00:52:46.997,00:52:49.124,But not when you can't see it.
00:52:49.207,00:52:56.798,"So open your eyes to life, to see it in the vivid colors that God gave us as a precious gift to His children."
00:52:56.882,00:52:58.884,Say yes to your life.
00:52:58.967,00:53:03.263,And when it comes to drugs and alcohol... just say no.
00:53:03.346,00:53:05.807,"No, no, no! No, Pablo, no, no!"
00:53:15.066,00:53:17.068,only the cockroaches will survive.
00:53:17.152,00:53:19.279,Leave that piece of shit there.
00:53:23.074,00:53:26.286,"During his career, Pablo would kill over a thousand cops."
00:53:27.162,00:53:29.080,But I wouldn't learn that till later.
00:53:33.668,00:53:38.882,My dad volunteered to fight in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.
00:53:39.090,00:53:41.134,But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?
00:53:42.093,00:53:43.553,No way.
00:53:44.220,00:53:48.767,"He was a West Virginia farm boy, but these fuckers stepped on our soil."
00:53:49.726,00:53:52.562,So he laced up his army boots and went to fight.
00:53:53.605,00:53:55.106,It was his duty.
00:53:56.775,00:53:58.902,Cocaine in Miami?
00:53:58.985,00:54:00.904,Kilos from Colombia?
00:54:01.988,00:54:04.282,This was my war.
00:54:04.366,00:54:06.868,This was my duty.
00:54:06.952,00:54:08.745,And I was ready to fight it.
00:54:08.828,00:54:11.414,"And my wife was ready to fight it with me, too."
00:54:11.498,00:54:12.707,"Your ticket, please."
00:54:14.084,00:54:15.251,OK.
00:54:15.335,00:54:18.338,We had no idea what we were in for.
00:54:19.714,00:54:24.010,One year later... all that patriotic bullshit was right out the window.
00:54:25.845,00:54:28.974,- We got Poison... - Excellent. Who else?
00:54:29.057,00:54:30.392,We got Lizard.
00:54:31.518,00:54:33.269,Uh...
00:54:33.353,00:54:34.771,"We got, we got..."
00:54:37.649,00:54:40.485,- Big Badmouth. - That motherfucker.
00:54:40.568,00:54:43.238,"- Thank you for the gift, agent. - No problem."
00:55:03.008,00:55:06.011,it's that life is more complicated than you think.
00:55:07.053,00:55:10.724,Good and bad... they're relative concepts.
00:55:12.017,00:55:15.895,"In the world of drug dealers, you do what you think is right..."
00:55:22.652,00:55:24.988,They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.
00:55:27.824,00:55:30.869,- Who did it? - I think it was Carrillo.
00:55:30.952,00:55:34.080,And there was a gringo DEA agent taking pictures.
00:55:38.168,00:55:40.837,"- Raise the bounty. - On Carrillo, sir?"
00:55:43.089,00:55:46.718,I'll pay half a million for the head of a DEA agent.
00:55:46.801,00:55:48.261,Half a million?
00:55:48.344,00:55:49.554,Do it.
00:55:49.637,00:55:51.139,"As you wish, sir."
00:55:56.519,00:55:58.396,Fucking gringos.
00:01:51.402,00:01:54.781,Americans were doing a couple hundred tons of cocaine every year.
00:01:56.282,00:02:00.411,"To satisfy American noses, the narcos ramped up their operations."
00:02:02.622,00:02:04.916,"- Here, honey. - Ah, thank you."
00:02:06.209,00:02:09.003,"- Hey, is that the Bahamas? - Hm?"
00:02:13.258,00:02:15.009,That's beautiful.
00:02:18.513,00:02:21.850,they needed a refueling stop between Colombia and Miami.
00:02:22.058,00:02:27.689,So Carlos Lehder bought an island in the Bahamas as a transshipment point for the drugs and money.
00:02:28.898,00:02:32.527,Turns out... it was a damn good place to party.
00:02:34.487,00:02:43.705,"It was modern day Sodom and Gomorrah, with the three things Carlos liked most: - sex, drugs, and Nazi sympathizers. - Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
00:03:00.805,00:03:03.224,We should be over the Amazon by now.
00:03:11.399,00:03:13.568,But things were different on the ground.
00:03:15.528,00:03:19.365,Pablo and his partners built superlabs the size of small cities.
00:03:21.492,00:03:27.665,"From leaf to paste to powder, they produced 10,000 kilos a week."
00:03:27.874,00:03:32.795,"At 50 grand a kilo, that's five billion dollars a year."
00:03:32.879,00:03:35.131,These guys weren't fuckin' around.
00:03:39.010,00:03:44.057,Pablo's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.
00:03:44.140,00:03:49.062,"They added it to liquor, to coffee, and just to be funny..."
00:03:49.145,00:03:50.688,they put it back in Coca-Cola.
00:03:50.772,00:03:52.065,¿Patrón?
00:03:52.148,00:03:53.149,Looks good?
00:03:58.154,00:03:59.614,It was the product.
00:04:06.579,00:04:10.458,Gacha bet Pablo that not even a German scientist could fool his dog.
00:04:17.423,00:04:20.468,Your prize dog didn't even stop.
00:04:20.551,00:04:22.762,There's no coke in that boat.
00:04:22.845,00:04:23.888,Come here.
00:04:25.598,00:04:29.894,It's blended right into the fiberglass hull.
00:04:30.561,00:04:34.524,Give me the money... the cash!
00:04:34.607,00:04:36.901,"Looks like you got taken with this dog, brother."
00:04:38.528,00:04:42.031,"- Hold this a moment. - Oh, Marquessa, my dear..."
00:04:42.991,00:04:44.450,"It's OK, it's OK."
00:04:48.830,00:04:51.958,- Are you fucking crazy? - What?
00:04:52.041,00:04:53.459,It's my dog.
00:05:00.258,00:05:01.509,Son of a bitch.
00:05:07.015,00:05:08.224,Pablo?
00:05:08.308,00:05:12.979,"- Pablo, we have a motherfucking problem. - Bastard murderer."
00:05:13.938,00:05:15.606,- He killed the dog. - I don't give a shit.
00:05:15.690,00:05:18.818,"If we don't resolve this problem, we're all dead. Come on."
00:05:20.695,00:05:23.990,"- Come on, man. - Son of a bitch."
00:05:33.166,00:05:35.335,"People are watching us, Pablo."
00:05:35.418,00:05:41.632,"They're asking themselves how two small businessmen - suddenly came up with so much cash. - Gustavo, brother..."
00:05:42.884,00:05:44.510,just launder the money.
00:05:45.553,00:05:51.309,Make it look legitimate... that's all.
00:05:52.268,00:05:54.437,Isn't that what Al Capone did?
00:05:56.355,00:05:58.983,- Al Capone? - Al Capone.
00:06:00.359,00:06:02.111,"You're a dumbass, Pablo."
00:06:02.195,00:06:04.614,- Al Capone is a terrible example. - Why?
00:06:04.697,00:06:07.325,Because Al Capone never had this much cash.
00:06:08.493,00:06:09.994,This is too much to launder.
00:06:11.120,00:06:12.330,"Well, then..."
00:06:13.831,00:06:16.125,let's buy a bigger washing machine.
00:06:20.630,00:06:24.801,"On paper, Pablo had the most profitable taxi company ever."
00:06:24.884,00:06:29.472,"He only had three cars, but he was pulling in more than five million dollars a week."
00:06:30.640,00:06:34.018,And Gacha had the most successful emerald mine of all time.
00:06:34.268,00:06:42.944,"He would inject bad stones with oil to make them shiny, then have his friends in Miami buy the emeralds with drug money and give them as gifts to hookers in town."
00:06:44.195,00:06:45.947,Everybody was happy.
00:06:49.033,00:06:52.370,"But no matter what they did, they couldn't hide all that money."
00:06:53.329,00:06:55.414,It just kept coming in.
00:06:59.961,00:07:07.135,"You have Picassos, Dalís, farms, houses, apartments, boats, planes, cars..."
00:07:08.219,00:07:10.972,I told you we have to fly low.
00:07:11.806,00:07:15.184,"If you keep spending like that, you're going to end up in Forbes Magazine."
00:07:15.268,00:07:17.603,"And if that happens, the government is going to have our asses."
00:07:20.064,00:07:22.024,What do you want me to say?
00:07:22.900,00:07:24.527,Bury it.
00:07:24.610,00:07:27.488,- How's that? - Bury the cash.
00:07:27.572,00:07:29.657,And cut the bullshit.
00:07:32.535,00:07:33.828,"Go on, pussy."
00:07:38.291,00:07:40.460,They buried it in fields...
00:07:42.044,00:07:46.007,"they hid it in caletas, hiding places in walls and ceilings."
00:07:47.717,00:07:51.012,They even stuck a million dollars in Pablo's mother's couch.
00:07:54.432,00:07:56.100,"Hey, Mom."
00:08:03.065,00:08:04.192,Sit.
00:08:11.157,00:08:13.326,"It isn't very comfortable, Pablito."
00:08:13.409,00:08:15.244,I'll buy you another sofa later.
00:08:15.328,00:08:18.498,"Wouldn't it be better if you put all this money in a bank, son?"
00:08:18.581,00:08:20.291,No.
00:08:20.374,00:08:22.835,All bankers are bandits.
00:08:22.919,00:08:24.420,"Really, honey?"
00:08:30.718,00:08:35.848,"not because he looked like a pirate, but because his job was to map out where the treasure was hidden."
00:08:38.601,00:08:41.020,But not even the pirate did the trick.
00:08:41.103,00:08:43.272,The problem was Colombia itself.
00:08:43.356,00:08:46.400,It was too small a country for a fortune that big.
00:08:46.484,00:08:51.572,"It was inevitable... someone, somewhere would try to snatch the narcos' treasure."
00:08:56.452,00:09:01.958,that the narcos have more money than the richest capitalist pig in this country.
00:09:05.545,00:09:08.714,"If we kidnap someone in their family, what are they going to do?"
00:09:11.968,00:09:17.348,"It says here that Gacha, The Mexican, is the ninth richest man in the world."
00:09:17.431,00:09:19.350,I say we kidnap his son.
00:09:24.105,00:09:27.316,"Plus, he's bought off half the military."
00:09:27.525,00:09:31.070,"Well, the Ochoa brothers are number 14 on the list."
00:09:31.153,00:09:33.489,Their sister Marta goes to the university.
00:09:33.573,00:09:34.782,How about her?
00:09:37.618,00:09:41.330,I like that more. The Ochoas are soft.
00:09:42.540,00:09:43.874,Wait a second.
00:09:45.001,00:09:46.919,What about Pablo Escobar?
00:09:48.963,00:09:51.757,"No one's crazy enough to kidnap drug dealers, right?"
00:09:52.592,00:09:56.470,"But if you're thinking that, it's because you're not familiar with M-19."
00:10:00.391,00:10:05.229,made up of college students and intellectuals who read too much Karl Marx for their own good.
00:10:06.939,00:10:10.151,Their leader was Ivan the Terrible Torres...
00:10:10.234,00:10:15.323,"a history professor who knew nothing about guerilla warfare, but understood the power of symbols."
00:10:16.407,00:10:31.005,"He broke into the Quinta de Bolívar Museum with his buddy Alejandro and Alejandro's girlfriend, Elisa, and stole a national treasure... the sword of Simón Bolívar, the mythic general who led Colombia to independence from the Spanish empire."
00:10:47.438,00:10:53.653,"These jokers even left a note: Bolívar, your sword returns to the battlefield."
00:10:55.363,00:10:59.992,It was a stroke of genius... a marketing stunt way ahead of its time.
00:11:00.076,00:11:02.078,And it made them famous overnight.
00:11:04.413,00:11:06.415,And I guess it went to their heads.
00:11:12.088,00:11:14.173,Escobar gives money to the poor.
00:11:14.256,00:11:17.551,You're right. Escobar is a man of the people.
00:11:17.635,00:11:18.969,He's all right with me.
00:11:19.178,00:11:20.679,"OK, then."
00:11:53.254,00:11:56.799,was also the day the Lion completed 100 trips to Miami.
00:12:13.399,00:12:15.401,- Sí. - Please.
00:12:18.529,00:12:20.072,Thank you.
00:12:24.285,00:12:25.453,Mm.
00:12:28.706,00:12:30.458,"Excuse me a second, please."
00:12:45.639,00:12:47.391,"and no I-435 identifying papers, either."
00:12:53.731,00:12:59.236,"Sure, but without the I-435, I can't officially state that it is indeed a cat."
00:13:01.155,00:13:05.242,I also can't guarantee that it's American.
00:13:07.745,00:13:10.789,"Sir, I'm not trying to make your life more difficult."
00:13:12.791,00:13:13.709,"OK, sir."
00:13:24.011,00:13:29.600,"Yeah, well, he's a little bit cranky, so... how important is this cat to you?"
00:13:29.850,00:13:31.143,Excuse me?
00:13:31.352,00:13:32.937,OK.
00:13:33.020,00:13:34.021,"Come with me, please."
00:13:55.251,00:13:57.461,"So... wait here, please."
00:13:58.712,00:14:01.382,And my boss will ask you for this paper later.
00:14:02.341,00:14:04.093,How long is it gonna be?
00:14:04.176,00:14:05.344,I don't know.
00:14:13.102,00:14:15.646,Pablo was trying to get into politics.
00:14:15.729,00:14:19.775,"When he said he was going to be president of Colombia, he meant it."
00:14:22.695,00:14:25.948,"- This is my wife, Tata. - Hello."
00:14:26.031,00:14:28.242,Don't worry. Everything will be perfect.
00:14:31.245,00:14:32.663,Just be yourself.
00:14:33.622,00:14:35.875,"Ma'am, it would be best if you weren't here."
00:14:38.669,00:14:41.130,"Look, Tata, there are a lot of people here."
00:14:41.213,00:14:43.048,It might not be good for the baby.
00:14:44.800,00:14:46.176,Go to the house.
00:14:59.023,00:15:01.358,Where is this guy? We've been waiting for hours now.
00:15:03.110,00:15:06.280,Maybe he's at terapia de pareja.
00:15:06.363,00:15:07.823,What's that?
00:15:07.907,00:15:09.325,Couples counseling.
00:15:10.910,00:15:11.911,Right.
00:15:12.870,00:15:14.288,What're you doing?
00:15:14.371,00:15:16.373,"Oh, I'm practicing my Spanish."
00:15:17.958,00:15:25.007,I'm Valeria Velez and I'm here with the man known as the Robin Hood of the poor for his generosity with the poor of Medellín.
00:15:27.301,00:15:31.055,She just compared Pablo Escobar to fucking Robin Hood.
00:15:33.974,00:15:38.270,"When you've run out of ways to hide your money, that's when you give it to the poor."
00:15:38.354,00:15:40.397,But I don't want to get ahead of myself.
00:15:44.234,00:15:47.237,"I was born in Rionegro, not too far from here."
00:15:47.321,00:15:54.912,And I asked myself how a government that exists for the people can be so out of touch with what they need.
00:15:54.995,00:16:00.876,"Hospitals, social and athletic programs, plus the construction of 400 houses in this community."
00:16:00.960,00:16:04.922,I hear you told your mother that one day you would be president of Colombia.
00:16:05.005,00:16:06.924,"Do you have any political aspirations, Mr. Escobar?"
00:16:07.007,00:16:11.387,None at all. My business takes up most of my time.
00:16:11.470,00:16:13.389,"I will tell you one thing, Valeria."
00:16:13.472,00:16:22.523,"For decades, our country has been led by Lopez and other families that are wealthy who made their fortune off exploiting the poor."
00:16:22.731,00:16:26.902,"They don't know what common people dream of, but I do..."
00:16:29.446,00:16:31.949,Bet he could get our cat into the country.
00:16:33.158,00:16:34.660,I can't believe it.
00:16:35.536,00:16:37.913,They don't even know he's a fucking drug dealer.
00:16:46.422,00:16:49.091,I didn't know I was about to be a blip on his.
00:16:59.226,00:17:04.982,"Uh, my wife's a little exhausted, so here is the cat's vaccination-- Your passport."
00:17:05.941,00:17:06.942,I'm sorry?
00:17:07.901,00:17:09.820,"Your passport, please."
00:17:28.505,00:17:32.593,"What do you do at the United States Embassy, Mr. Murphy?"
00:17:32.676,00:17:34.928,"I am in, uh, janitorial services."
00:17:35.888,00:17:38.223,Janitorial services.
00:17:38.307,00:17:39.850,Another one.
00:17:41.143,00:17:43.437,Your embassy must be very clean.
00:17:43.645,00:17:47.274,"Oh, yeah. You bet your ass it is."
00:17:48.776,00:17:50.027,Your cat's cleared.
00:17:52.571,00:17:54.156,Enjoy Colombia.
00:18:26.021,00:18:30.150,the journalist who first interviewed Pablo... watch out.
00:18:30.234,00:18:32.653,She was as dangerous as M-19.
00:18:53.882,00:18:57.719,Don't ever disrespect Tata.
00:19:03.684,00:19:07.271,"I'm sorry, Pablo... I'm sorry."
00:19:09.731,00:19:11.150,Forgive me.
00:19:15.946,00:19:17.781,It won't happen again.
00:19:17.865,00:19:19.032,I promise.
00:19:30.085,00:19:33.338,How can I apologize? Huh?
00:19:47.811,00:19:50.480,Want to put it in my ass? Hm?
00:19:59.072,00:20:03.243,And she got herself in just the right place to take full advantage of him.
00:20:04.703,00:20:12.461,"Not unlike my partner Javier Peña, who figured the best way to get inside narco information was to hang out with the same women they did."
00:20:45.661,00:20:47.663,"You're amazing, Javier."
00:20:50.207,00:20:51.541,Well...
00:20:55.087,00:20:56.755,don't go overboard.
00:21:02.928,00:21:04.513,It's the truth.
00:21:06.056,00:21:07.891,What can you offer me to drink?
00:21:07.975,00:21:10.227,Whiskey or tap water.
00:21:11.353,00:21:12.938,Water.
00:21:23.448,00:21:26.326,What you're missing in this apartment is a woman.
00:21:26.410,00:21:28.287,It's fine the way it is.
00:21:29.246,00:21:32.541,"Well, I wasn't offering."
00:21:40.966,00:21:42.217,Here.
00:21:47.139,00:21:49.474,"If you were a client, you would have paid me already."
00:21:53.020,00:21:55.939,- And you wouldn't know my real name. - Don't take it the wrong way.
00:21:56.023,00:22:00.068,It's cash from Uncle Sam for the information you never gave me.
00:22:02.988,00:22:04.656,Take it.
00:22:07.326,00:22:08.744,And my visa?
00:22:10.162,00:22:12.914,Give me something I can use and we'll talk about it.
00:22:18.962,00:22:20.964,What are you doing this weekend?
00:22:21.173,00:22:24.134,- I'm going to Medellín. - Work or play?
00:22:25.010,00:22:26.928,I have to take care of my child.
00:22:27.637,00:22:29.514,"I can pay, too."
00:22:33.101,00:22:35.562,"Those guys are richer than Uncle Sam, Javi."
00:22:39.232,00:22:40.358,Come here.
00:22:43.070,00:22:45.155,- What? - Give me a kiss.
00:22:45.989,00:22:47.699,Give me a kiss.
00:22:58.543,00:23:01.213,I guess I'll have to find another girl.
00:23:01.421,00:23:05.050,Good luck with that. We're all going to Medellín.
00:23:05.258,00:23:07.219,Some of us are even going by plane.
00:23:10.388,00:23:12.099,Helena?
00:23:12.182,00:23:13.600,Helena.
00:23:17.521,00:23:18.980,Whose party is it?
00:24:24.713,00:24:26.548,Mother Teresa of Calcutta.
00:24:40.979,00:24:42.230,"Gustavo, too."
00:24:50.697,00:24:52.699,At Las Margaritas.
00:25:07.297,00:25:09.841,- I met my partner... - Javier?
00:25:09.925,00:25:12.135,...who introduced me to the DEA.
00:25:14.012,00:25:15.972,These guys are R.I.P. Retired in Place.
00:25:16.056,00:25:17.974,"- Eat me, Peña. - Paid vacation's over, fellas."
00:25:18.058,00:25:19.309,Murphy and I are going to Medellín.
00:25:19.517,00:25:22.395,We'll telex the T-3 reports. They go straight to Washington.
00:25:24.105,00:25:25.941,We are going to Medellín?
00:25:30.237,00:25:31.613,"Murphy, this is Mil Group."
00:25:31.696,00:25:35.200,They advise Colombian military on communist threats in the countryside.
00:25:35.283,00:25:36.660,"Hey, those are classified."
00:25:36.868,00:25:39.871,- Now they're declassified. - That's the ambassador's call.
00:25:39.955,00:25:41.456,No problem.
00:25:48.505,00:25:49.798,Why do you need this intel?
00:25:50.924,00:25:53.843,There's an unusual number of prostitutes headed to Medellín this weekend.
00:25:54.052,00:25:55.595,Every high-end girl in Bogotá.
00:25:55.679,00:25:57.847,"First class airfare, five-star hotels."
00:25:58.056,00:26:00.100,The narcos are having a meeting and then a party.
00:26:00.308,00:26:02.560,What does the M-19 have to do with this?
00:26:02.769,00:26:05.522,Somebody kidnapped Marta Ochoa. Intel suggests it was M-19.
00:26:05.605,00:26:08.525,I need access to the M-19 files to confirm.
00:26:09.276,00:26:16.408,"If I find out one single dollar of American taxpayer money went to any of those hookers, it'll be your ass."
00:26:16.616,00:26:18.618,"OK, thank you. One last thing, Ambassador."
00:26:18.702,00:26:19.911,"Yes, Agent Peña?"
00:26:20.120,00:26:22.706,I'm filing a visa request for my informant. I need your signature.
00:26:22.914,00:26:24.457,You're bothering me.
00:26:26.584,00:26:28.503,She sure likes you.
00:26:28.586,00:26:30.338,Is your informant really a prostitute?
00:26:30.422,00:26:32.215,Everybody works for somebody.
00:26:43.143,00:26:44.894,Pablo's home turf.
00:26:51.901,00:26:57.282,"First stop: Carlos Holguín School, Colonel Carrillo's base of operations."
00:27:10.628,00:27:15.550,Your intel was good. The traquetos are gathering at Las Margaritas.
00:27:31.483,00:27:35.278,The pictures I took that day helped to ID guys for months to come.
00:27:51.961,00:27:54.339,"Fernando Galeano, the Wolfman..."
00:28:05.934,00:28:07.560,Is that Gacha?
00:28:08.478,00:28:11.022,I've never seen him with other traffickers.
00:28:19.531,00:28:21.616,Get pictures of that fucker.
00:28:36.089,00:28:40.844,What we didn't know was that we were witnessing the formation of the famed Medellín cartel.
00:28:41.845,00:28:48.184,Pablo took advantage of the kidnapping of Marta Ochoa to bring all the narcos together for the very first time.
00:28:49.769,00:28:52.313,And then he proclaimed himself their leader.
00:28:57.569,00:29:01.448,is that we form an organization.
00:29:01.531,00:29:08.538,"Pool our resources to train soldiers, trade knowledge and buy information."
00:29:09.372,00:29:17.005,"And so the message is clear, we're going to name our group Death to Kidnappers."
00:29:19.174,00:29:24.679,What I propose: I will manage all operational aspects.
00:29:24.763,00:29:27.348,All you need to do is cover my expenses.
00:29:28.725,00:29:33.396,What you gentlemen will receive in return: two things.
00:29:33.480,00:29:36.524,One... I promise to end the kidnapping.
00:29:37.442,00:29:41.070,"Two... and at this moment, the most important..."
00:29:42.197,00:29:46.367,I promise to return Marta Ochoa to her family.
00:30:02.342,00:30:06.513,Peña had finally gotten one of his informants right into the heart of the action.
00:30:11.476,00:30:14.437,"Don't forget La Quica! Take care of him, too."
00:30:19.567,00:30:21.152,"Sit down, my love."
00:30:23.780,00:30:26.449,- How are you? - Good. And you?
00:30:26.533,00:30:28.493,I like your hat.
00:30:28.576,00:30:30.411,It looks good on you.
00:30:31.246,00:30:32.914,"- Do you think so? - Yes, it looks good."
00:30:32.997,00:30:34.249,Let's see.
00:30:47.387,00:30:48.930,You think she slipped?
00:30:49.138,00:30:51.099,"Nah, she's no dummy."
00:30:55.270,00:30:57.522,Maybe she's getting pretty for you.
00:30:57.605,00:30:58.857,Yeah.
00:31:18.835,00:31:21.671,she was willing to do anything to help our cause.
00:31:22.714,00:31:24.591,And that was a problem.
00:31:30.179,00:31:32.181,Let me relax you a bit.
00:31:37.979,00:31:40.982,So what happened at that meeting that made you so tired?
00:31:46.154,00:31:48.364,What did you hear?
00:31:48.448,00:31:50.742,Nothing. Just making conversation.
00:32:01.544,00:32:04.714,"- She's already dead. - No, they wouldn't kill her at the hotel."
00:32:04.797,00:32:06.507,Then they killed her somewhere else.
00:32:06.591,00:32:08.384,She knew the risks.
00:32:08.468,00:32:10.428,"If we're going back, we go back now."
00:32:16.809,00:32:19.020,I can pick up a sicario. You OK with that?
00:32:19.103,00:32:21.105,- I'm going with you. - What about Fresh Meat?
00:32:23.608,00:32:26.444,"- Yeah, and where are you going? - We're gonna go look for her."
00:32:43.419,00:32:46.297,"- Guys. - Hey, what happened?"
00:32:46.381,00:32:48.633,That little girl doesn't move. Like a dead cow.
00:32:48.716,00:32:50.093,"What, did you kill her?"
00:33:44.355,00:33:46.983,I gotta rough this girl up.
00:33:47.066,00:33:49.193,Gacha wants to know if she knows something.
00:33:49.277,00:33:51.779,Gacha's paranoid.
00:33:53.156,00:33:57.493,Wait a second... I don't like them bruised.
00:33:57.577,00:33:59.954,"Let me have a little more fun, then I'll let her go."
00:34:02.582,00:34:04.000,This one's for all of you!
00:34:22.018,00:34:23.561,Any news on the radio?
00:34:27.273,00:34:29.233,"Sorry, I don't speak English."
00:35:38.803,00:35:40.721,Helena?
00:36:05.705,00:36:08.833,All right. She's coming out.
00:36:15.214,00:36:16.299,"Let's go, boys."
00:36:25.016,00:36:25.892,¡Vamos!
00:36:34.192,00:36:35.985,Where the fuck's Peña? ¿Dónde está Peña?
00:36:58.925,00:37:01.928,"- Is she gonna be OK? - Physically, yeah."
00:37:02.011,00:37:04.180,"Mentally, I haven't got a fucking clue."
00:37:05.389,00:37:10.228,"- You left me behind on purpose. - Look, man-- If we're gonna be partners, I don't get left behind."
00:37:10.311,00:37:13.898,"I didn't come all the way down here, Peña, to sit on the fucking sidelines."
00:37:17.318,00:37:22.740,Whatever's going on here... I'm in all the way.
00:37:22.823,00:37:24.450,Is that understood?
00:37:29.538,00:37:30.790,Understood.
00:37:35.044,00:37:36.837,I hope you know what that means.
00:37:48.683,00:37:53.646,"He was going to kill them, one by one, until he got Marta Ochoa back."
00:37:53.729,00:37:57.650,Ivan the Terrible thought he could hide in the jungle and wait it out.
00:37:57.733,00:38:00.736,"Sooner or later, he figured the narcos would cave in."
00:38:01.570,00:38:03.281,Big mistake.
00:38:03.364,00:38:05.741,M-19 didn't stand a chance.
00:38:21.215,00:38:23.134,"Signed, Death to Kidnappers."
00:38:46.198,00:38:47.992,And the killing didn't stop.
00:38:48.909,00:38:52.496,"Pablo had tasted blood, and he liked it."
00:38:56.250,00:38:58.919,A little closer. A little closer!
00:38:59.003,00:39:01.756,"You know what, boss? Go a little higher."
00:39:01.839,00:39:05.926,A little bit higher and a little bit closer so you can see the tree!
00:39:07.178,00:39:08.512,That's it.
00:39:10.598,00:39:14.685,Now a little bit higher so you can see the little tree!
00:39:15.811,00:39:17.271,That...
00:39:17.480,00:39:18.856,That's it. Perfect.
00:39:18.939,00:39:21.776,DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS A little more.
00:39:21.859,00:39:24.862,That's it! There you go.
00:39:36.123,00:39:39.877,Didn't I tell you not to let anyone into the park?
00:39:39.960,00:39:42.129,- I'll take care of it. - Are you crazy or what?
00:39:42.213,00:39:44.173,Stupid asshole.
00:39:44.256,00:39:46.008,It's a woman with a baby.
00:39:47.009,00:39:50.805,Take a picture so we can send it to the newspapers.
00:39:50.888,00:39:52.056,Do it.
00:39:52.139,00:39:54.100,"Good day, ma'am."
00:39:54.308,00:39:58.396,"- Good day. - I'm sorry, but the park is closed today."
00:39:58.479,00:40:00.439,What do you mean the park is closed?
00:40:00.523,00:40:02.608,May I escort you out?
00:40:02.691,00:40:05.152,Why is it closed? I come by here every day.
00:40:05.236,00:40:10.408,It's because there is a foul odor and I don't want the child to get sick.
00:40:10.491,00:40:12.701,I thought I smelled something.
00:40:12.785,00:40:14.203,- Right? - Yes.
00:40:14.286,00:40:15.996,"Oh, look, what a beautiful little baby."
00:40:16.080,00:40:18.541,"Right, just like his dad. Thank you very much."
00:40:18.624,00:40:21.669,"- You must be proud. - Yes, of course."
00:40:21.752,00:40:24.839,My wife and I are having a baby very soon.
00:40:24.922,00:40:27.216,"Oh, very good. Congratulations!"
00:40:27.299,00:40:30.177,"I don't know if it's a boy or a girl, but as long as it's healthy."
00:40:30.261,00:40:34.807,"Yes, of course. The most important thing is health."
00:40:39.979,00:40:42.731,gave Pablo an image of invincibility.
00:40:43.482,00:40:47.736,"If he could do this to the feared communists, he could do it to anyone."
00:40:49.196,00:40:51.907,Ivan the Terrible was quick to realize...
00:40:51.991,00:40:54.076,there was only one thing he could do.
00:40:59.457,00:41:01.584,What do you want us to do with this guy?
00:41:04.170,00:41:05.754,Should I kill him or what?
00:41:14.513,00:41:16.849,"From what I can see, you're not going to stop."
00:41:18.184,00:41:20.811,"Here I am, so you can finish what you started..."
00:41:22.521,00:41:24.899,but with the sword of Bolívar.
00:41:51.217,00:41:54.929,It's a very beautiful gift. Thank you very much.
00:41:59.725,00:42:00.809,Stand up.
00:42:04.688,00:42:10.653,I guarantee no harm will come to you or your family.
00:42:15.282,00:42:18.786,"From now on, we are going to work together."
00:42:26.669,00:42:27.962,"Go in peace, brother."
00:42:43.519,00:42:45.312,Is that what I think it is?
00:42:46.355,00:42:47.982,You've gotta be kidding.
00:42:53.779,00:42:57.199,I want you to run my day-to-day operations.
00:42:59.451,00:43:01.787,And you'll do what?
00:43:03.998,00:43:06.166,Liberate Colombia.
00:43:14.258,00:43:16.594,Welcome to the Medellín cartel.
00:43:37.698,00:43:46.457,Many Colombians like Major Horacio Carrillo were so invested in the future of their country that they were ready to do whatever it took to fix it.
00:43:48.667,00:43:53.339,This was a war that would shake an entire country to its foundations.
00:43:53.422,00:43:57.134,And in the carnage... mine would be shaken as well.
00:43:59.678,00:44:01.555,"Even my wife, Connie, wanted to help."
00:44:01.764,00:44:05.059,She got a job as a nurse in a local comuna.
00:44:07.895,00:44:10.522,I guess she forgot we were in Colombia.
00:44:10.606,00:44:13.776,"Look, our escolta will drive me there and back every day."
00:44:13.859,00:44:16.362,- Yeah. - He'll wait outside all day.
00:44:16.445,00:44:19.573,You know the last time you were in church is when we got married.
00:44:19.657,00:44:21.825,"Well, I'm letting the Lord back into my life."
00:44:21.909,00:44:22.993,"Hey, stop right here."
00:44:31.960,00:44:33.671,Praise God.
00:44:47.559,00:44:51.063,I want that escolta watching every inch of you at that comuna now.
00:44:52.689,00:44:54.483,"Hey, did we leave the door open?"
00:45:11.250,00:45:12.918,You stay right there and don't move.
00:00:22.480,00:00:25.734,"I'm more of a dog man myself, but no cat deserves this."
00:00:26.735,00:00:28.862,Did you tell anyone about why you were down here?
00:00:28.945,00:00:30.905,Someone on the plane? Someone you met at a restaurant?
00:00:30.989,00:00:32.073,'Course not.
00:00:32.157,00:00:36.077,"Not to get personal, but have you had any, uh... encounters?"
00:00:36.244,00:00:37.871,- Encounters? - Yeah.
00:00:41.332,00:00:42.584,Right.
00:00:43.334,00:00:47.589,Only people I've encountered outside the DEA and my wife are those Colombian cops in Medellín.
00:00:47.756,00:00:49.174,"No, no, Carrillo's solid."
00:00:49.257,00:00:51.050,Did anyone have access to your credentials?
00:00:51.217,00:00:53.553,Did you drop your wallet?
00:00:53.636,00:00:54.721,Passport.
00:00:54.888,00:00:56.765,How important is this cat to you?
00:00:57.474,00:00:58.349,Excuse me?
00:01:02.228,00:01:04.355,We were trying to get Puff through Immigration.
00:01:04.522,00:01:05.732,Puff?
00:01:05.899,00:01:07.525,"I didn't name it, dude."
00:01:07.692,00:01:10.361,Traffickers pay people at the airports for intel.
00:01:10.528,00:01:13.573,A gringo coming in from Miami raises suspicions. That's how you got made.
00:01:14.491,00:01:16.201,Don't let it rattle you. That's what they want.
00:01:16.284,00:01:19.037,"You probably got a price on your head, but no one's gonna take the contract."
00:01:19.204,00:01:20.205,Fucking price on my head?
00:01:20.288,00:01:27.587,"There's a standing bounty of 350,000 US on any DEA down here, but you're safe... because of Kiki."
00:01:30.965,00:01:36.304,"was Kiki Camarena, a DEA agent who went after the Guadalajara cartel in Mexico."
00:01:36.471,00:01:38.681,Kiki was captured and tortured.
00:01:38.848,00:01:44.354,"They skinned his legs, put a bullet in each limb, used an electric drill on his head until he died."
00:01:47.565,00:01:51.820,They could kill an American government agent and get away with it?
00:01:51.903,00:01:55.657,Uncle Sam doesn't fuck around. The cocksuckers paid in blood.
00:01:56.574,00:02:02.997,"They went after them so hard, every single narco in the world got the message that the DEA is off-limits."
00:02:03.081,00:02:05.583,Kiki was like Jesus Christ to us.
00:02:05.667,00:02:06.918,He died to save us all.
00:02:07.377,00:02:10.213,Do not tell Connie that story.
00:02:10.380,00:02:11.589,I won't.
00:02:11.673,00:02:14.092,- But you shouldn't forget it either. - Why?
00:02:14.968,00:02:17.220,This cat is DEA.
00:02:17.303,00:02:19.430,"Mark my words, it will get justice."
00:04:09.332,00:04:10.667,Newspapers...
00:04:12.961,00:04:14.462,magazines...
00:04:19.050,00:04:23.054,Everyone is talking about the Paisa Robin Hood.
00:04:23.137,00:04:27.308,"Pablito, I'm sorry. If I had known that-- You're going to have to pay for that, my love."
00:04:28.309,00:04:30.311,"Anything you want, Pablito."
00:04:30.478,00:04:32.355,Anything I want?
00:04:32.438,00:04:34.816,"Yes, my love, whatever you want."
00:04:34.899,00:04:36.442,You sure?
00:04:58.089,00:05:01.342,you're going to help me get into Congress.
00:05:04.429,00:05:05.680,"Yes, Pablo."
00:05:07.056,00:05:08.308,Yes.
00:05:21.571,00:05:23.823,Those shitty oligarchs.
00:05:25.950,00:05:28.369,"Those people, all of their lives..."
00:05:29.620,00:05:33.374,don't know what it's like to wonder where their next meal is coming from.
00:05:36.502,00:05:38.838,"I come from nothing, Valeria..."
00:05:40.548,00:05:43.051,and I have more money than any of those sons of bitches.
00:05:43.134,00:05:47.013,"If you run for Congress, you put yourself in the public eye, you become a target."
00:05:48.306,00:05:52.435,I made my money from taxis isn't going to work when you face the press.
00:05:53.728,00:05:57.315,"Pablo, you need a party that supports you."
00:05:57.523,00:06:00.568,You need a proper political campaign.
00:06:01.986,00:06:03.905,"I buy the press, my love."
00:06:05.198,00:06:09.827,"And as far as a political party, I am quite sure that I can buy one of those as well."
00:06:11.120,00:06:12.622,I don't want to be good.
00:06:15.917,00:06:17.710,I am going to be great.
00:06:17.877,00:06:25.551,"A PAISA ROBIN HOOD Well, not in Colombia. Not in the mid-'80s."
00:06:25.718,00:06:28.930,"As far as Colombians go, Pablo wasn't a drug dealer at all."
00:06:29.013,00:06:31.099,He was a fucking winner.
00:06:31.265,00:06:33.851,The living embodiment of the Colombian dream.
00:06:33.935,00:06:37.021,The guy who'd buy houses for the poor in exchange for nothing.
00:06:37.855,00:06:41.359,"As far as Pablo could tell, the doors to political success were there..."
00:06:42.485,00:06:44.529,and all he had to do was to get to them.
00:06:46.989,00:06:52.954,"And in order to do that, he asked Valeria Velez to introduce him to Fernando Duque."
00:06:58.209,00:07:04.799,"Duque was a lawyer and a lobbyist who represented the New Liberals, a party who claimed to represent the people."
00:07:10.847,00:07:11.681,Pablo!
00:07:14.100,00:07:16.227,"- Valeria, how are you doing? - Well, thank you."
00:07:16.310,00:07:17.728,Mr. Duque.
00:07:17.895,00:07:21.149,It gives me great pleasure to invite you to the Hacienda Nápoles.
00:07:21.232,00:07:22.775,"- Nice to meet you. - Please, come."
00:07:23.568,00:07:24.777,"After you, Valeria."
00:07:27.780,00:07:28.906,Please.
00:07:30.700,00:07:35.872,"Look, I am not a rich person. I am a poor person with money."
00:07:35.955,00:07:38.124,"And for that reason, I think that..."
00:07:39.208,00:07:43.754,"Well, I think that I understand the people to whom the New Liberalism wants to give a voice."
00:07:43.921,00:07:48.426,"The party clearly needs to hear what you have to say, Mr. Escobar."
00:07:49.802,00:07:52.638,There is a great deal of talk about how you have made your money.
00:07:52.805,00:07:56.559,I need guarantees concerning the origins of your fortune.
00:07:58.102,00:08:01.564,And Valeria told you... how much I am going to donate?
00:08:01.731,00:08:03.566,"- No, no-- - Look, I am not a politician."
00:08:03.649,00:08:08.571,I am not a successful lawyer like you. I come from the street... brother.
00:08:08.738,00:08:12.783,I want to reassure you that you will receive your piece.
00:08:12.867,00:08:16.746,"- It's not about that-- - Assuming your piece is ten percent, your piece would be what?"
00:08:16.913,00:08:19.290,"$300,000 just for you."
00:08:23.711,00:08:26.631,Does that seem like a sufficient guarantee for the Justice Minister or what?
00:08:26.797,00:08:29.133,"- Most definitely. - All right, then."
00:08:29.217,00:08:31.052,Let's go look at the hippos. Come on.
00:08:36.015,00:08:37.183,Pablo?
00:08:38.809,00:08:41.395,- And what about me? - What about you?
00:08:42.813,00:08:44.315,I don't get my piece?
00:08:45.149,00:08:47.235,"No, my queen. The thing is that you..."
00:08:48.528,00:08:50.696,"you're in this for love, right?"
00:08:53.699,00:08:55.993,"Look, Minister..."
00:08:56.077,00:08:59.080,"Escobar has founded schools, clinics."
00:08:59.163,00:09:01.499,He has created sources of employment throughout Medellín.
00:09:01.582,00:09:04.168,"The people love him, and he loves the people."
00:09:04.252,00:09:06.963,"And from a legal point of view, his money is clean."
00:09:07.046,00:09:10.758,"And according to Forbes Magazine, he's a drug trafficker."
00:09:10.841,00:09:15.012,Are you going to believe all of that American imperialist propaganda?
00:09:15.096,00:09:16.097,Take a look.
00:09:18.891,00:09:24.272,These are property holdings papers.
00:09:24.355,00:09:25.523,Look.
00:09:25.606,00:09:30.278,He's the owner of hundreds of properties in Colombia and also the United States.
00:09:33.573,00:09:36.951,"If there was, there would be proof of his background."
00:09:42.039,00:09:43.332,How much is he paying you?
00:09:45.126,00:09:47.211,"I am thinking about our party, Minister."
00:09:48.296,00:09:51.841,Escobar is prepared to contribute millions of dollars.
00:09:52.008,00:09:56.429,We already support Jairo Ortega so that he can campaign in Antioquia.
00:09:56.512,00:09:59.140,Let's let Escobar be his alternate.
00:09:59.223,00:10:05.271,"What do you prefer... rumors and insinuations, or fewer representatives in Congress?"
00:10:10.776,00:10:12.820,You're not going back to that comuna!
00:10:12.903,00:10:15.448,"What, you want me to stay in this apartment for the next two years?"
00:10:16.907,00:10:18.618,"Oh, my God, you do."
00:10:18.784,00:10:20.494,"Honey, your cat was killed as a warning to me."
00:10:20.661,00:10:21.704,Our cat.
00:10:21.871,00:10:22.955,"OK, our cat."
00:10:24.332,00:10:27.710,What if you went back to Miami just for a little while until things quiet down?
00:10:31.797,00:10:35.301,"I'll tell you what. I'll agree to go back to Miami if you agree to go back, too."
00:10:35.384,00:10:38.012,- You prepared to do that? - I'm not giving in on this one!
00:10:50.358,00:10:52.568,I already stick out like a sore thumb.
00:10:52.652,00:10:54.904,The bodyguards are only gonna draw more attention.
00:10:55.071,00:10:56.614,Just humor me.
00:10:56.781,00:10:59.700,I can't do my job if I'm worried about your safety.
00:11:00.701,00:11:01.619,Mm...
00:11:06.874,00:11:09.001,"Hey, mind parking down the street a little?"
00:11:09.126,00:11:10.628,I'll scream if I need you.
00:11:19.720,00:11:21.347,"- Buenos días, Father. - Connie."
00:11:21.430,00:11:22.973,"What, are you surprised to see me?"
00:11:23.057,00:11:25.684,We've had American volunteers. They come and go.
00:11:25.768,00:11:27.311,"Well, this one will keep coming."
00:11:35.027,00:11:36.570,working in the comuna?
00:11:36.737,00:11:40.408,That's because you don't know the liberation church in Colombia.
00:11:40.574,00:11:43.452,"And the priest... innocent, right?"
00:11:43.536,00:11:46.372,Wrong. He's more of a commie than she is.
00:11:48.332,00:11:49.959,"A child of God, just like you."
00:11:50.042,00:11:51.836,Hm. Got it.
00:12:02.054,00:12:05.474,This isn't just any cat. This is a gringo cat of the DEA.
00:12:12.022,00:12:16.235,"It was the narcos, Suárez. We don't take this shit lightly."
00:12:17.903,00:12:19.405,Your friend is a little crazy.
00:12:25.703,00:12:27.788,"Get me some information, Suárez."
00:12:29.748,00:12:33.752,to go through hundreds of hours of chatter over a fucking cat.
00:12:33.919,00:12:37.548,"If this was information about the narcos, yes, my people are interested."
00:12:37.631,00:12:39.341,But they won't give a fuck about the cat.
00:12:42.261,00:12:43.596,Tell me about it.
00:12:47.266,00:12:51.979,"to find out who killed the fucking cat, that is going to cost you more."
00:12:53.939,00:12:56.108,They broke into the house to kill his cat.
00:12:56.984,00:12:59.778,I think they made him when he arrived at the airport in Bogotá.
00:12:59.945,00:13:01.071,Find out.
00:13:09.663,00:13:13.125,- then you gotta get a receipt? - I gotta get reimbursed.
00:13:18.214,00:13:22.301,and he assures me that you gave out his personal information to certain criminals.
00:13:23.135,00:13:24.595,That's not true.
00:13:25.721,00:13:28.140,These guys killed his cat.
00:13:29.141,00:13:32.811,"Maybe you don't know this, but the mistreatment of animals is a federal crime."
00:13:34.438,00:13:35.439,Is this funny to you?
00:13:36.315,00:13:40.819,"They can bring formal charges against you, and you could lose your job."
00:13:40.903,00:13:43.697,"Do you not need your job, Santiago?"
00:13:44.823,00:13:45.950,"Yes, I need it."
00:13:55.709,00:13:59.255,"Mr. Murphy, do you recognize these men?"
00:14:02.174,00:14:05.761,"so you could take my passport and copy and scan it, didn't you?"
00:14:08.847,00:14:14.061,You both are being accused of conspiring against a federal agent of the United States.
00:14:14.853,00:14:18.857,The cat is under the jurisdiction of the American government.
00:14:18.941,00:14:21.819,And to kill it is the same as to kill a police dog.
00:14:25.030,00:14:26.490,This is absurd.
00:14:27.825,00:14:34.874,"Look, I'm a Colombian citizen, and I know exactly my-- You will not disrespect them!"
00:14:37.835,00:14:43.507,"If I open my mouth, they kill me... and they kill my wife."
00:14:43.674,00:14:46.010,He's having problems with his wife.
00:14:46.176,00:14:47.261,Shut up!
00:14:51.140,00:14:52.725,This is quite simple.
00:14:54.059,00:15:04.904,"I can get the phone number of the person to whom you sent those documents, and I can tell him that you accused him of being the cat killer."
00:15:05.070,00:15:06.488,How does that sound?
00:15:11.994,00:15:14.705,I sent a copy of that passport...
00:15:15.915,00:15:18.042,to a man they call...
00:15:19.793,00:15:20.628,Poison.
00:15:25.633,00:15:28.844,You're going to take this money to Fernando Duque in Bogotá.
00:15:29.011,00:15:30.721,And this is the address.
00:15:30.804,00:15:35.684,"If they stop you on the road, just salute the official, give them a little bribe and continue forward."
00:15:36.477,00:15:37.728,No violence.
00:15:37.811,00:15:39.688,And you call me every two hours.
00:15:39.772,00:15:42.107,"- Of course, boss. Whatever you say. - OK, then. No showing off."
00:15:53.994,00:15:55.245,"Getting ready, right?"
00:15:55.412,00:15:58.999,"You are meeting up with politicians, not with gangsters."
00:16:01.126,00:16:03.128,"Aren't they the same thing, boss?"
00:16:04.797,00:16:07.174,Politicians scare easily.
00:16:07.257,00:16:09.176,You're fine with just a pistol.
00:16:09.259,00:16:11.804,"Go to it, then. Go to it, dumbass."
00:16:16.058,00:16:18.519,was recorded saying he was driving to Bogotá this afternoon.
00:16:18.602,00:16:20.187,"For what purpose, we don't know."
00:16:20.270,00:16:24.733,"But if we don't respond to the obvious threat to Agent Murphy, we're sending the wrong message."
00:16:24.817,00:16:27.194,"Police have the information, then they should make the arrest."
00:16:27.277,00:16:29.446,"No. No, if we leave it to them, someone will sell us out."
00:16:29.530,00:16:32.157,The narcos have informants in their department.
00:16:32.324,00:16:34.910,What Peña's driving at is that Major Carrillo should man a roadblock.
00:16:34.994,00:16:40.874,"- We can trust Carrillo. - I don't have authority - over the Colombian police. - All due respect, Ambassador, but you know where we are."
00:16:40.958,00:16:42.710,"With enough money, you can get anything done."
00:16:45.504,00:16:49.883,"Excuse me for saying so... but this isn't much of a roadblock, is it?"
00:16:49.967,00:16:54.805,"Well, if the roadblock is too obvious, Pablo can be tipped off by a cop or by a passerby, who knows."
00:16:56.265,00:16:58.475,Can anybody in this country keep a secret?
00:16:59.184,00:17:01.437,I've got a spotter set up about four kilometers away.
00:17:01.520,00:17:03.063,He's gonna let us know when Poison passes.
00:17:07.026,00:17:09.028,"If I catch him alive, you guys can question him here."
00:17:09.987,00:17:11.280,Then you guys gotta go.
00:17:21.957,00:17:23.333,Sixty-five.
00:17:23.500,00:17:25.544,"Hey, brother, that's a lot."
00:17:25.627,00:17:27.254,You sure?
00:17:27.337,00:17:29.923,I counted every single son of a bitch.
00:17:30.090,00:17:31.550,All right!
00:17:31.717,00:17:34.219,"Sure, but are you counting what happened last night?"
00:17:34.303,00:17:36.013,"Of course, that was number 65."
00:17:36.096,00:17:39.641,Don't bullshit. I was the one who shot that faggot.
00:17:42.561,00:17:44.354,if I was the one who killed that little man.
00:17:47.941,00:17:49.651,I shot him first.
00:17:58.035,00:17:59.870,Did you give information about Poison to the DEA?
00:18:00.037,00:18:01.163,So?
00:18:01.330,00:18:05.584,"I'm still listening to their phone conversations, and it's not a shipment of drugs."
00:18:05.667,00:18:11.799,"They're carrying three million dollars to Bogotá, and if two guys from the DEA stop that car, Pablo is going to hang you by the balls."
00:18:16.970,00:18:20.516,"- You don't have 65, Poi. - Yes, I do."
00:18:20.682,00:18:21.892,Eh!
00:18:26.814,00:18:29.399,"Look, 65, man!"
00:18:32.903,00:18:35.239,"Now we're going to have to wash the car, man!"
00:18:41.537,00:18:43.914,I'm going to help you avoid an enormous loss.
00:18:44.081,00:18:46.166,And how much is it going to cost me?
00:18:46.250,00:18:49.586,"Ten percent... $300,000."
00:18:54.174,00:18:56.677,- How did you find out? - One of your men.
00:18:56.844,00:19:00.139,That Poison... he talks too much.
00:19:00.305,00:19:02.474,You should take his phone away.
00:19:02.558,00:19:03.809,Five percent.
00:19:27.666,00:19:30.460,You bring your fucking mouth back here immediately!
00:19:30.627,00:19:33.088,"- Yes. I'm sorry, boss. - Now!"
00:19:35.257,00:19:37.509,The son of a bitch policeman tapped my phone!
00:19:37.676,00:19:42.014,"- These fags. - You have a very big mouth, Poison."
00:19:42.097,00:19:43.682,Pablo is really pissed off.
00:19:44.474,00:19:47.811,"Shut that mug, or you will never reach 66, you hear?"
00:19:57.571,00:19:58.739,OK!
00:20:08.540,00:20:12.002,- What the fuck has happened here? - Maybe Poison spotted the spotter.
00:20:12.169,00:20:13.670,Either that or Suárez sold you out.
00:20:16.256,00:20:18.091,and it wasn't a fucking cat.
00:20:24.556,00:20:26.475,but he is much more than that.
00:20:26.558,00:20:30.229,He is a man to whom the people mean a great deal. All of us.
00:20:33.398,00:20:39.029,"Pablo ran as an alternate for Jairo Ortega, a former congressman from Antioquia."
00:20:40.948,00:20:45.661,It was the first time an alternate was more important than the main candidate.
00:20:56.546,00:21:02.594,"This is a fight between the people with power and poor people, weak people."
00:21:03.512,00:21:06.473,And this fight must begin here!
00:21:09.768,00:21:15.649,To have power does not mean that one can abuse the poor.
00:21:15.816,00:21:17.025,If I am elected...
00:21:17.943,00:21:21.530,"if my friend, Jairo, is elected..."
00:21:21.613,00:21:25.659,those who have never had a voice will have a voice.
00:21:28.245,00:21:31.790,Those who are hungry will have food.
00:21:31.957,00:21:35.294,Those who want to learn will have schools.
00:21:35.460,00:21:42.301,And those who have dreams will see that there are no limits to what you can achieve.
00:21:46.430,00:21:51.977,"whom you have always had, the friend of today, the friend of yesterday and the friend of tomorrow."
00:21:55.439,00:21:56.398,Thank you very much.
00:22:07.200,00:22:10.203,"My friend, Jairo Ortega!"
00:22:21.173,00:22:22.299,Thank you very much.
00:22:30.057,00:22:31.767,"- You were marvelous, my love. - You sure?"
00:22:34.936,00:22:37.814,"There are a few things we can improve, but we'll work on them."
00:22:37.898,00:22:38.815,"OK, whatever you say."
00:22:38.899,00:22:41.693,"- Congratulations. - Thank you so much, Valeria."
00:22:41.777,00:22:43.028,"Congratulations, ma'am."
00:22:45.363,00:22:46.364,Excuse me.
00:22:57.751,00:23:01.505,To vote for Jairo Ortega is to vote for the one and only Pablo!
00:23:06.885,00:23:09.096,"Tata, what's wrong?"
00:23:12.390,00:23:15.727,Why does that woman need to know everything about each step you take?
00:23:15.811,00:23:17.562,What are you talking about?
00:23:18.647,00:23:21.900,- Valeria Velez. - My love...
00:23:21.983,00:23:26.655,"Tata, she's a newspaper woman, a reporter who follows the news."
00:23:27.906,00:23:29.533,"And right now, I'm the news."
00:23:30.951,00:23:35.205,"When you win, don't disrespect me anymore with that bitch."
00:23:38.208,00:23:40.627,Slowly... come on.
00:23:45.799,00:23:49.594,You are going to be the First Lady of this country one of these days.
00:23:50.262,00:23:53.765,"Therefore, you are going to have to learn to deal with the press."
00:23:56.852,00:23:58.061,She degrades you.
00:23:58.228,00:24:00.814,"Please, don't worry about Valeria."
00:24:23.295,00:24:24.462,"You know what, Pablo?"
00:24:26.131,00:24:28.884,"To me, it looks like you are handling things very badly."
00:24:32.262,00:24:35.891,You need to start thinking more about your family... and about business.
00:24:37.350,00:24:39.102,"Thing is, you can't be a politician."
00:24:39.895,00:24:41.146,Says who?
00:24:46.484,00:24:48.195,simply so they will love you.
00:24:50.447,00:24:53.116,We... are bandits.
00:24:58.496,00:25:02.500,"If you run for Congress, find someone else to manage the laboratories."
00:25:14.304,00:25:16.932,"God has blessed us with a girl, Pablo."
00:25:26.024,00:25:28.610,Shh.
00:25:28.735,00:25:30.237,Shh.
00:25:57.681,00:26:00.850,"Mother Mary, man. What do you want us to do?"
00:26:00.934,00:26:05.313,You can't give Pablo Escobar a spanking as though he were some spoiled brat.
00:26:05.480,00:26:06.606,"Oh, no?"
00:26:07.482,00:26:08.608,And why not?
00:26:08.692,00:26:11.444,Careful with the threat you cannot execute.
00:26:16.908,00:26:18.868,"You know what he's doing, right?"
00:26:18.952,00:26:23.957,"According to Colombian law, a congressman has total immunity."
00:26:24.124,00:26:28.253,Do you think he's protecting himself while we remain in the drift?
00:26:28.336,00:26:31.589,I do. He thinks he's that fucking Paisa Robin Hood.
00:26:31.673,00:26:33.758,So what do we do?
00:26:33.842,00:26:44.269,"Well... we fulfill our duties, stuffing the ballot box, and later we let Pablo receive the applause, and take the risk."
00:26:44.352,00:26:50.400,"We continue with our business... in the shadows, like always."
00:26:51.818,00:26:53.862,"Carlos, what are the guys saying?"
00:26:55.238,00:26:57.699,"I imagine that they're worried, right?"
00:26:57.782,00:27:00.368,"They are not politically conscious, brother."
00:27:03.872,00:27:06.708,How can you expect them to understand your objectives?
00:27:10.754,00:27:12.672,"You do understand me, brother."
00:27:14.883,00:27:18.678,Imagine... a state governed by us.
00:27:19.554,00:27:22.098,"Immunity for everyone, brother."
00:27:22.182,00:27:25.060,"We, Carlos, belong to the people."
00:27:25.143,00:27:28.480,I need you to use your influence with the others to convince them that I am right.
00:27:28.563,00:27:30.607,"If you win, you don't need to explain anything."
00:27:31.399,00:27:34.486,And if you lose... there's nothing to explain.
00:27:37.447,00:27:39.491,- Hitler said it. - Fuck off.
00:27:39.574,00:27:41.076,Yes.
00:27:41.159,00:27:46.247,He also said that no politician should ever let his picture be taken in a bathing suit.
00:28:07.185,00:28:08.853,"Well, that's what he said."
00:28:15.360,00:28:19.072,"that what I want, sincerely..."
00:28:20.031,00:28:22.200,is to help the poor people of this country...
00:28:23.827,00:28:25.286,do you believe me or what?
00:28:29.833,00:28:32.502,in the poorest neighborhoods of his electoral district.
00:28:33.670,00:28:39.843,"He placed himself on the side of the poor and the weak in the fight against the oligarchs, The Men of Always."
00:28:41.428,00:28:45.348,"And just like any politician, he made plenty of promises."
00:28:45.432,00:28:49.769,Only difference was Pablo had the men and the money to back them up.
00:28:52.272,00:28:54.774,It was becoming clear to everyone that Pablo was gonna win.
00:28:56.359,00:28:59.612,The only question remaining was... what to do about that.
00:29:01.072,00:29:15.754,"Gustavo made good on his promise to quit the labs, With characteristic German efficiency, he turned the labs into Nazilandia, and production rose 12 percent in just two short months."
00:29:18.339,00:29:26.973,"Gacha and the Ochoas adopted a wait-and-see attitude, debating how and when Pablo would dispose of Jairo Ortega, his front man, once the election was over."
00:29:32.061,00:29:35.148,I say he's running toward his death.
00:29:43.072,00:29:46.075,We cannot have Colombia become a narco state.
00:29:46.159,00:29:49.078,We need to find someone who can prove this guy is a drug dealer.
00:29:49.162,00:29:51.039,Let's stop his campaign before it starts.
00:29:51.122,00:29:52.832,No one will go on record.
00:29:54.000,00:29:55.460,I got a better idea.
00:29:56.544,00:29:58.046,We let him win.
00:29:58.213,00:30:03.009,"If we put him in the spotlight and prove he's a trafficker, the embarrassment alone might get this country off its ass."
00:30:07.096,00:30:09.599,that Pablo was the drug dealer we knew he was.
00:30:09.766,00:30:23.530,"So we went to Suárez, First, he told us that Pablo was arrested for trafficking back in '76, and then he gave us the name of a sergeant who could give us the files."
00:30:27.242,00:30:31.830,"Problem was, Suárez was on both the DEA and the narcos' payroll."
00:30:39.045,00:30:42.090,- Sixty-six. - Bullshit. I shot him first.
00:30:50.849,00:30:53.518,...and then the lawyer who defended Pablo...
00:30:53.726,00:30:56.729,"and finally, the judge who signed Pablo's arrest warrant."
00:30:58.648,00:31:01.150,We were like the Bermuda Triangle.
00:31:01.317,00:31:03.570,"You get too close to us, you disappear."
00:31:03.736,00:31:06.030,We gotta get something on this motherfucker.
00:31:07.365,00:31:09.242,"If he was arrested, there's gotta be a mug shot."
00:31:11.452,00:31:13.830,"If there was a mug shot, then it's gone, too."
00:31:15.748,00:31:17.375,"If there was a photo, there's a negative."
00:31:20.545,00:31:28.469,"We had to find someone without Suárez's help, and that was the photographer who had taken Pablo's mug shot years ago."
00:31:33.099,00:31:36.853,"We got his negatives, and for safekeeping, we put him into witness protection."
00:31:40.815,00:31:43.067,- How long have you had this picture? - That's classified.
00:31:44.903,00:31:45.987,And what am I doing here?
00:31:46.070,00:31:48.948,It's not America's role to get involved in other countries' elections.
00:31:49.032,00:31:52.035,"Once again, the hand of the United States remains invisible."
00:31:52.118,00:31:53.953,Your party took money from Escobar.
00:31:54.037,00:31:55.788,I should think you'd want to get ahead of this.
00:31:55.872,00:31:57.165,Everyone took money.
00:31:57.332,00:32:01.586,"By the way, it's all American money, so why don't you take this to the press?"
00:32:01.669,00:32:04.547,It should come from you. You're the Minister of Justice.
00:32:10.595,00:32:15.892,The New Liberal party had the candidate who got the most votes in all of Antioquia...
00:32:15.975,00:32:18.102,and his name was Jairo Ortega.
00:32:20.146,00:32:23.232,with clear use of my mental and physical faculties...
00:32:24.150,00:32:31.115,I wish to communicate to you my decision to resign from my seat in the Congress of the Republic...
00:32:34.994,00:32:46.047,"But I am completely certain that my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria is going to continue our social and political ideas, because Pablo is the voice of the people."
00:32:46.130,00:32:48.091,"- Thank you very much. - Thank you very much, Jairo."
00:32:50.093,00:32:50.927,Thank you very much.
00:33:26.879,00:33:36.305,"in a poor city, in a poor country, and by the time you were 28 years old, you have so much money you can't even count it."
00:33:39.475,00:33:41.060,What do you do?
00:33:51.571,00:33:54.323,"Problem is, nobody can control the dreams they have."
00:33:59.662,00:34:01.414,Especially if you were Pablo Escobar.
00:34:03.332,00:34:06.002,Especially if you grew up in Colombia.
00:34:11.132,00:34:14.218,There's a reason magical realism was born in Colombia.
00:34:16.262,00:34:19.348,It's a country where dreams and reality are conflated...
00:34:22.226,00:34:25.229,"where, in their heads, people fly as high as Icarus."
00:34:28.399,00:34:31.027,But even magical realism has its limits.
00:34:34.697,00:34:36.282,Excuse me.
00:34:36.365,00:34:38.910,Allow me to remind you of the norms of etiquette.
00:34:38.993,00:34:41.245,You cannot enter the hall if you don't have a tie.
00:34:44.248,00:34:45.458,All right.
00:34:45.541,00:34:47.919,- What is your name? - Juan.
00:34:48.002,00:34:49.587,"Look, Juan..."
00:34:50.630,00:34:53.466,that is a really nice tie.
00:34:53.549,00:34:55.009,- My girlfriend gave it to me. - Really?
00:34:55.093,00:34:56.427,Yes.
00:34:56.511,00:35:00.098,"Well, she's in the history books now."
00:35:00.973,00:35:02.767,"- Thank you very much, my son. - Thank you, sir."
00:35:02.850,00:35:04.185,- Thank you. - All right.
00:35:11.067,00:35:13.152,your dreams may melt away.
00:35:30.962,00:35:34.757,This is to inform you that we have a quorum and may now begin our session.
00:35:36.759,00:35:45.059,"The Minister of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, is present here today to address this honorable Congress."
00:35:45.226,00:35:48.729,"I give the floor to you, Mr. Minister."
00:35:48.813,00:35:50.231,Thank you very much.
00:35:55.027,00:36:05.580,"Much has been made of the issue of drug money, hot money, in our national political process."
00:36:05.746,00:36:14.338,I myself have been accused of receiving campaign contributions from the narcotics traffickers who have bought influence in these halls.
00:36:19.427,00:36:21.929,"To this charge, I plead guilty."
00:36:24.515,00:36:30.605,"In my eyes, the sin of turning a blind eye is as great as the sin of outright corruption."
00:36:30.771,00:36:37.528,"We are a nation of the blind, and in our blindness, we have sold our country to the highest bidder."
00:36:40.489,00:36:42.950,It's time for us to open our eyes and to see the light.
00:36:50.208,00:36:51.709,Congressman Escobar...
00:36:53.085,00:36:57.089,you stated that your great fortune was built from a taxi company.
00:36:59.634,00:37:03.429,This photograph clearly contradicts your claim.
00:37:04.222,00:37:06.724,"For this reason, I demand your resignation."
00:37:06.891,00:37:08.976,You are not welcome in this chamber.
00:37:10.269,00:37:11.354,You don't belong here.
00:37:57.566,00:38:00.194,"Thank you very much, Juan. Very kind."
00:38:02.071,00:38:09.662,"isn't just the fall of the Minister of Justice, but also to impede the strategy of the government to combat his interests."
00:38:10.496,00:38:13.624,His two arms: silver or lead.
00:38:13.791,00:38:26.846,I want to inform the people that the Minister of Justice has 24 hours within which to present concrete proof regarding the insinuations he made the day before yesterday in the Hall of Representatives.
00:38:26.929,00:38:33.978,"To the contrary, I will proceed to denounce him legally before the authorities and before the Colombian justice system."
00:38:36.772,00:38:39.066,trying to smear Lara with accusations.
00:38:42.236,00:38:43.362,before the Colombian people.
00:38:43.529,00:38:50.953,"I look for peace, I have always preached peace, and have longed for peace and the prosperity of the Colombian people."
00:38:54.749,00:39:02.256,"can be threatened or bought at will, we see with clarity the real dimension of the drug problem here in Colombia."
00:39:04.091,00:39:09.597,"He denounced narcos at every opportunity, going after the guys that we hadn't been able to touch."
00:39:09.680,00:39:14.852,He revealed that six of the country's nine soccer teams were owned by drug traffickers.
00:39:16.312,00:39:22.943,"Gacha the Mexican was forced to give up ownership of his team, aptly nicknamed The Millionaires."
00:39:24.195,00:39:28.199,Lara denied flying permits for 57 planes in the Ochoa fleet.
00:39:32.161,00:39:36.415,He even fined Pablo for illegal importation of elephants and camels from Africa.
00:39:46.509,00:40:00.022,"men who are able to put themselves up against drug traffickers, who with complete tranquility buy or kill any person or government institution who is against their interests."
00:40:04.110,00:40:06.153,with his stand against the narcos.
00:40:06.237,00:40:08.697,He just wouldn't stop going after them.
00:40:08.781,00:40:13.536,His bravery in the face of danger made him the most wanted man in the country.
00:40:13.619,00:40:17.915,"For his own safety, he was appointed Colombian ambassador to Czechoslovakia."
00:40:17.998,00:40:22.545,"He was slated to leave in two weeks, but a lot could happen in two weeks."
00:40:23.629,00:40:26.424,I think it might be a good idea for you to wear this until you leave.
00:40:28.008,00:40:30.428,"You feel responsible, is that it?"
00:40:32.012,00:40:33.389,"Somewhat, yes, sir."
00:40:39.562,00:40:45.025,That I put my life and the life of my family at risk for American policy objectives?
00:40:46.777,00:40:51.574,"Let me assure you, Agent Murphy, outside of providing me with the picture, you... did nothing."
00:40:53.367,00:40:55.953,The decision to speak out was solely mine.
00:40:56.120,00:40:58.956,"And I highly advise you to wear this vest, sir."
00:41:08.799,00:41:15.055,I will accept this vest... out of respect for your concern with my well-being.
00:41:15.222,00:41:18.309,But I would advise you one thing while you remain in Colombia.
00:41:18.392,00:41:19.727,And what is that?
00:41:19.894,00:41:24.148,"We accept your help, but never your condescension."
00:41:25.232,00:41:29.278,"When all this is over, Colombians will be the heroes, and the victims."
00:41:30.821,00:41:33.699,John Wayne only exists in Hollywood.
00:41:34.909,00:41:36.076,Just wear the vest.
00:41:51.258,00:41:54.053,We knew they wouldn't accept you in that circle.
00:41:57.223,00:41:58.974,Damned bastards.
00:42:05.314,00:42:07.775,"You're too good for them, Pablito."
00:42:30.589,00:42:33.592,"This is a fight that you cannot win, cousin."
00:42:36.011,00:42:39.390,You need to think more about your family and the business...
00:42:42.101,00:42:44.436,and abandon that ridiculousness once and for all.
00:42:49.984,00:42:51.527,I will fix it.
00:43:02.079,00:43:13.841,"Due to the vicious lies and slander cast my way by Minister Lara and his cronies, I've decided to announce my resignation from Congress of the Republic."
00:43:16.093,00:43:25.936,"I ran as a representative for the common man, a voice for those who had no voice, but that has happened through much of our history."
00:43:26.020,00:43:30.274,The powerful have conspired to silence me.
00:43:30.941,00:43:32.818,I dreamt of doing good.
00:43:34.570,00:43:36.322,Those dreams are over.
00:43:38.240,00:43:43.245,But make no mistake... I will not go quietly.
00:43:44.246,00:43:45.623,I will fight.
00:44:04.600,00:44:05.684,Thank you very much.
00:44:33.712,00:44:34.880,He didn't wear it.
00:44:37.716,00:44:39.677,Wouldn't have made a difference.
00:44:45.099,00:44:48.268,It was the first time I'd felt guilty about my job.
00:44:55.109,00:45:02.950,"...he made so much money playing both sides, he decided to lift our spirits by giving the DEA a token of his appreciation."
00:45:09.581,00:45:11.166,"- I hope she likes it. - No, gracias."
00:00:32.657,00:00:34.743,"Murphy, join t' party, huh?"
00:00:39.164,00:00:40.623,What's wrong?
00:00:40.707,00:00:42.834,All you guys having a good time?
00:00:42.917,00:00:45.503,"You gotta let it go, man. There's good that came out of this."
00:00:46.421,00:00:48.465,"Yeah, we used him, then we got him killed."
00:00:48.548,00:00:51.301,"No, we didn't kill him... Escobar did."
00:00:51.384,00:00:53.762,And now we get to go after that motherfucker.
00:01:03.188,00:01:08.902,One of the sicarios caught after Lara Bonilla's assassination confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.
00:01:11.154,00:01:15.283,An important politician had been murdered and everyone knew who did it.
00:01:16.451,00:01:18.953,"Finally, the Colombian government had to react."
00:01:19.996,00:01:23.083,Pablo Escobar was indicted for the murder of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.
00:01:23.166,00:01:30.256,"WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA $100,000 REWARD Colombia agreed to the one thing narcos feared most: extradition."
00:01:31.132,00:01:39.098,"Now any Colombian who smuggled drugs to America could be prosecuted and jailed in the US, even if they never stepped foot on our soil."
00:01:40.141,00:01:42.435,This made all the difference in the world.
00:01:45.522,00:01:50.151,"jail time meant banging girls, watching movies, hanging with the fellas..."
00:01:50.235,00:01:54.239,Grease the right hands and you'd get a reduced sentence for good behavior.
00:01:54.322,00:01:56.157,It was a fucking joke.
00:01:56.366,00:01:58.743,"Back home, it was a whole different deal."
00:01:58.827,00:02:02.622,The seventh richest man in the world? No one gives a shit.
00:02:02.705,00:02:08.628,"You still get a 6x8 cell 23 hours a day, just like every other loser, a fucking nightmare."
00:02:08.837,00:02:12.549,Now Pablo had someone to fear: us.
00:03:44.349,00:03:47.268,Extradition doesn't mean anything unless you can catch him.
00:03:47.352,00:03:49.896,"- With our help, you will. - Oh, that's right."
00:03:49.979,00:03:51.481,Gringos to the rescue.
00:03:55.526,00:04:05.203,"One man with helicopters, airplanes, vehicles, planned escape routes, - and a network of informants. - Our government will provide money, - men, weapons-- - You make it sound so easy."
00:04:05.995,00:04:09.332,But Escobar has always managed to stay one step ahead of us.
00:04:10.208,00:04:11.834,Help us catch him.
00:04:12.961,00:04:15.922,I'll never be assigned to this. Jaramillo hates my guts.
00:04:16.005,00:04:17.590,Let me take care of that.
00:04:19.676,00:04:22.553,- You think extradition's a victory. - It is.
00:04:29.018,00:04:31.145,Escobar will not go lightly.
00:04:34.023,00:04:36.609,He will make Colombia bleed.
00:04:47.996,00:04:50.331,"- Shut up, fag. - What the fuck, Carlos?"
00:04:51.874,00:04:53.501,Why are you always defending him?
00:04:53.584,00:04:55.545,Did he get your sister back for you or not?
00:04:55.753,00:04:59.424,We rescued her because we did it together. Right?
00:05:04.012,00:05:05.388,Gentlemen...
00:05:08.099,00:05:14.022,I suggest we form another organization to fight against the injustice of extradition.
00:05:14.105,00:05:19.861,"Like John Lennon said, - Come together, brothers and sisters-- - Stop that fag shit right now."
00:05:21.362,00:05:23.072,So Jorge...
00:05:24.032,00:05:25.199,what will we call it?
00:05:29.746,00:05:34.959,"Once again, the narcos were united against a common enemy: jail in America."
00:05:35.043,00:05:38.671,"But it was not quite like one for all, and all for one."
00:05:41.632,00:05:43.426,It was more like each man for himself.
00:05:45.011,00:05:57.523,"Gacha, being Gacha, decided that all he had to do to defeat extradition Next!"
00:05:57.732,00:06:01.486,"Lehder, being Lehder, got high as a kite and took to the airwaves."
00:06:06.324,00:06:09.410,So why are we the ones who need to be extradited?
00:06:14.749,00:06:18.920,are because of those imperialist gringos!
00:06:25.676,00:06:29.222,"and got ripped off because, well... that's what PR agencies do."
00:06:31.516,00:06:32.975,than a grave in the United States.
00:06:37.230,00:06:41.651,Better a grave in Colombia than a cell in the United States.
00:06:41.734,00:06:43.194,- What do you think? - I love it.
00:06:45.696,00:06:49.117,"And for $50,000 more, we'll make your logo."
00:06:49.826,00:06:51.202,Done.
00:06:57.375,00:07:02.463,"In the upcoming presidential election, extradition became the defining issue amongst the candidates."
00:07:02.547,00:07:05.133,"Those the narcos could buy, they bought."
00:07:05.341,00:07:07.426,"The ones they could scare, they scared."
00:07:07.635,00:07:10.388,But Luis Carlos Galán was neither.
00:07:10.596,00:07:19.772,"And so, unable to buy him and unable to scare him, Escobar tried out that fancy new stationery, and he wrote Galán a letter."
00:07:25.653,00:07:33.453,over the improper interference of North America in a way that entails the most flagrant violation of the sovereignty of our Motherland.
00:07:34.370,00:07:36.164,He's got some balls.
00:07:36.372,00:07:37.957,Escobar is shameless.
00:07:38.040,00:07:42.628,"The United States is inclined to support your bid for the presidency, Mr. Galán."
00:07:42.712,00:07:48.718,"But even if we indict these narcos in the United States, we still can't get them there without Colombian approval."
00:07:48.801,00:07:51.679,We're curious as to your view on extradition.
00:07:52.930,00:07:57.185,"My campaign manager, Dr. Gaviria, doesn't want me to stick my foot in my mouth."
00:07:58.060,00:08:04.066,"America wants Pablo Escobar to prove they're winning a battle, when clearly, they're losing a war."
00:08:04.984,00:08:07.111,I'll do what's best for Colombia.
00:08:12.575,00:08:14.911,and that will be your death sentence.
00:08:14.994,00:08:19.248,"I don't care about the Americans, but I am still going to support extradition."
00:08:19.332,00:08:24.003,"Besides, if the gringos want to take away all the goddamn killers of this country, then let them take them."
00:08:25.796,00:08:28.424,Pablo reached out to many of the country's judges.
00:08:28.633,00:08:33.554,He figured out that a sanctioned law would do no harm if no judge was willing to apply it.
00:08:35.598,00:08:47.693,"As you pass judgment on one of our sons and consider sending him to his fate in the United States, know we, the Extraditables, will pass judgment on you and bring a sentence far harsher."
00:08:47.777,00:08:52.907,The judges were so scared and intimidated that special court procedures had to be created.
00:08:52.990,00:08:58.412,"For the first time in the history of Colombia, it was the good guys who had to hide their faces behind the masks."
00:09:01.999,00:09:05.795,You've been tried and convicted of cocaine trafficking.
00:09:06.003,00:09:12.802,You will immediately be turned over to the DEA for extradition to the United States.
00:09:18.516,00:09:21.852,"And true to form, when the pen failed..."
00:09:21.936,00:09:23.938,Pablo was always ready with the sword.
00:09:29.569,00:09:36.867,"In light of this terrorism, you'd think that everyone in Colombia would've made catching Escobar the number one priority, right?"
00:09:36.951,00:09:38.369,"Well, guess again."
00:09:38.578,00:09:42.331,Communists. They're the real threat to the security of this country.
00:09:42.415,00:09:46.043,"All due respect, but Colombian cocaine has killed more Americans than Soviet troops."
00:09:46.252,00:09:52.466,"We got FARC, we got M-19, we got EPL, we got ELN, all supported by the Soviets and Cubans."
00:09:52.550,00:09:58.681,"Sorry, Agent Peña, but our resources gotta be directed at America's problems, and you don't get to tell us what those are."
00:10:03.436,00:10:07.189,"With Reagan in the White House, it was hard to forget."
00:10:07.273,00:10:11.527,In his words: They are the focus of evil in the modern world.
00:10:16.115,00:10:19.535,"In Hollywood, he named some actors as communist sympathizers."
00:10:19.619,00:10:25.374,"In Washington, he created the Reagan Doctrine, which opposed Soviet-backed communists all over the world."
00:10:26.500,00:10:28.919,Drug traffickers just didn't rate.
00:10:29.003,00:10:33.841,"You want to turn on the tap of the richest country in the world, you'd better be chasing reds."
00:10:34.050,00:10:39.472,"Ambassador, if the CIA and the Mil Group provide assets, the Colombians will get Escobar."
00:10:39.555,00:10:45.311,We're talking about a huge blow to the cocaine trade - and saving thousands of lives-- - Ambassador.
00:10:45.394,00:10:50.483,The CIA agrees with Mil Group. Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.
00:10:50.566,00:10:58.866,"He's just a wanted Colombian drug trafficker, and as such, he is not a direct threat to our country's strategic interests in South America."
00:10:59.033,00:11:04.121,The CIA would prefer not to get involved in local police problems.
00:11:04.205,00:11:05.831,Let the Colombians get him.
00:11:07.583,00:11:13.255,"Noonan really thinks allocating $100,000 - will be enough to go after Escobar. - Yeah, it's a fucking joke."
00:11:13.339,00:11:15.091,"That's about what he spends on shoes, isn't it?"
00:11:15.174,00:11:18.260,The CNP has zero chance of capturing him with that bullshit.
00:11:18.344,00:11:19.762,So what do we do now?
00:11:19.845,00:11:22.348,Use what little we got to try to even the odds.
00:11:27.103,00:11:29.855,"But delivered into the right hands, it could make a difference."
00:11:31.148,00:11:34.693,"There were a lot of good cops in Colombia, honorable men."
00:11:34.777,00:11:39.657,"But the head of counternarcotics, General Jaramillo, wasn't one of 'em."
00:11:41.826,00:11:44.870,"And as such, he was exactly what we needed."
00:11:47.706,00:11:49.333,You're welcome.
00:11:49.417,00:11:53.003,"Listen, I have General Gomez assigned to the operation against Pablo."
00:11:53.087,00:11:57.466,"With all due respect, General Jaramillo... I propose Horacio Carrillo."
00:11:57.550,00:12:00.719,But Carrillo only acts on his own orders. He doesn't follow anyone.
00:12:00.803,00:12:02.638,"Well, I don't want him to follow."
00:12:03.472,00:12:05.141,I want him to lead.
00:12:11.230,00:12:12.231,Go ahead.
00:12:13.566,00:12:15.443,"Yes, General."
00:12:15.526,00:12:17.653,As you wish.
00:12:17.736,00:12:18.904,Understood.
00:12:22.074,00:12:24.118,"What happened, honey?"
00:12:24.201,00:12:25.995,Things with work.
00:12:26.078,00:12:28.289,When will Horacio arrive to have dinner with us?
00:12:28.372,00:12:32.251,"I'm making the chicken he likes, but he's out with the girlfriend."
00:12:35.337,00:12:37.339,Tell me what's wrong.
00:12:37.548,00:12:40.259,They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.
00:12:44.638,00:12:46.682,The Ochoas aren't happy at all.
00:12:48.017,00:12:53.439,"They're saying that since you've become a wanted man, bribing the police has gotten very costly."
00:12:53.522,00:12:55.566,They want to renegotiate the price of our routes.
00:12:58.652,00:13:02.156,"When it came to me killing to get their sister back, well, then..."
00:13:02.239,00:13:04.158,"I didn't hear them complaining, did I?"
00:13:04.241,00:13:09.830,Yeah. The problem is that it is one thing to kill communists - and another to kill politicians. - So what now?
00:13:10.039,00:13:13.751,"What I would do is increase the payments to the police, you know?"
00:13:13.834,00:13:15.127,"And most of all, to the top brass."
00:13:15.336,00:13:18.088,We're already giving too much money to those bastards.
00:13:22.301,00:13:25.221,"Oh, shit. What's that? Is it snowing or what?"
00:13:29.141,00:13:31.602,It took two years to train them to stay there.
00:13:32.436,00:13:34.772,They cost me a million dollars.
00:13:41.779,00:13:43.030,Bastards.
00:13:44.406,00:13:46.742,Stay in the fucking tree!
00:13:57.086,00:13:59.338,"Seems like you lost that dough, eh, cousin?"
00:14:01.966,00:14:03.509,"That's your problem, Pablo."
00:14:03.592,00:14:08.681,"You think that everything can be controlled, but it turns out that nature cannot be controlled."
00:14:19.066,00:14:22.194,Thank you. I took a course at the University of Antioquia.
00:14:22.403,00:14:23.904,How long you been at the comuna?
00:14:24.113,00:14:26.073,Just a few weeks.
00:14:26.156,00:14:28.701,"Is your husband gonna help us here, too?"
00:14:28.784,00:14:32.121,I saw him when he dropped you off. What does he do?
00:14:32.329,00:14:36.959,"Oh, he's, uh... head of janitorial services at the US Embassy."
00:14:42.756,00:14:45.175,- I fucked up. - How?
00:14:45.259,00:14:46.802,Carrillo got the job just like you wanted.
00:14:47.011,00:14:49.013,"No, Jaramillo's sending a message."
00:14:51.473,00:14:53.767,He's telling me I got his price wrong.
00:14:53.851,00:15:00.691,"He's setting Carrillo up for failure, and when he does fail, he'll fire him for incompetence, and me and you, we lose the only cop we can trust."
00:15:03.360,00:15:04.570,- Hey! - Hey!
00:15:04.653,00:15:06.363,"- Sorry I'm late, honey. - Mm..."
00:15:07.031,00:15:09.909,"Javier, this is my friend, Elisa."
00:15:09.992,00:15:11.785,- Javier works with Steve. - Nice to meet you.
00:15:11.869,00:15:12.912,Nice to meet you.
00:15:13.954,00:15:17.416,"Are you another... janitor at the embassy, like Steve?"
00:15:17.499,00:15:19.585,"No, actually, I'm CIA."
00:15:19.793,00:15:23.088,"But that's classified, so don't tell anybody."
00:15:23.172,00:15:26.717,I'm here to hunt communists and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.
00:15:26.800,00:15:29.511,"- The janitor thing, what, that was you? - Mm."
00:15:29.595,00:15:31.764,"No, it's just a cover."
00:15:31.847,00:15:34.266,- Thank you for being so honest. - Mm-hm.
00:15:34.350,00:15:37.311,"Just so you know, I'm a communist guerrillera."
00:15:39.521,00:15:40.606,Perfect.
00:15:44.068,00:15:45.903,we probably wouldn't have cared.
00:15:45.986,00:15:48.280,We cared about Pablo Escobar.
00:15:48.364,00:15:51.450,And catching him... wasn't gonna be easy.
00:15:51.533,00:15:54.578,He had better resources and better information.
00:15:54.787,00:16:00.209,"And at the time, he owned over 800 homes and fincas, surrounded by dozens of sicarios willing to die for him."
00:16:00.417,00:16:03.879,"And cops... he owned a lot of them, too."
00:16:04.088,00:16:05.130,But not all of them.
00:16:05.339,00:16:09.677,Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.
00:16:09.760,00:16:12.304,The only way to surprise him is an aerial assault.
00:16:12.388,00:16:14.640,Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.
00:16:15.849,00:16:18.352,Then we need to figure out where he's hiding today.
00:16:21.271,00:16:22.982,Trapped a little bird.
00:16:24.108,00:16:25.693,And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.
00:16:26.944,00:16:27.820,Jesus.
00:16:33.575,00:16:35.744,Just remember that you wanted all in.
00:16:52.177,00:16:54.430,but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.
00:17:21.749,00:17:25.002,I know it scares the shit out of you that Pablo will kill you.
00:17:26.628,00:17:28.922,But I will also kill you.
00:17:29.757,00:17:31.091,And very slowly.
00:17:35.512,00:17:40.017,"Well, then, you should pray we find him, and quickly."
00:17:46.106,00:17:51.737,"but there was a small part of me that thought, in his arrogance, he would stand and fight."
00:17:51.820,00:17:54.281,Or maybe we just wanted to send him a message.
00:17:56.325,00:17:57.326,Poison...
00:17:57.409,00:17:58.702,Boss!
00:17:59.953,00:18:02.956,"They were headed for El Bizcocho, but they got off the main highway."
00:18:03.040,00:18:05.793,- They're already on their way here. - How far are they?
00:18:06.001,00:18:07.127,"Two hours, boss."
00:18:07.336,00:18:10.672,"Round up the guys, and tell them to get ready."
00:18:10.756,00:18:12.674,- We're leaving. - All right.
00:18:16.261,00:18:17.763,We have to go.
00:18:18.680,00:18:20.057,Go where?
00:18:20.140,00:18:21.850,The police are coming.
00:18:21.934,00:18:28.148,"- But Pablo, I've been cooking for hours. - I'm sorry, my love, - but we need to leave now. - What about our things? Our clothes?"
00:18:28.232,00:18:30.109,"We'll buy new ones later, won't we?"
00:18:36.406,00:18:38.075,Do you hear me complaining?
00:18:40.786,00:18:46.125,"As long as you're with us, Pablo, I'm prepared to do whatever it takes."
00:18:58.220,00:18:59.555,- Cangrejo! - Yes?
00:18:59.638,00:19:02.808,Go to Pablo's room and see if anything is in there.
00:19:02.891,00:19:04.184,- Efrain! - Yeah?
00:19:04.268,00:19:06.728,The two blue notebooks are the only ones I'm taking.
00:19:10.274,00:19:13.360,Search the whole house to make sure that not a single loose document remains.
00:19:32.171,00:19:34.006,"What's wrong, Gustavo?"
00:19:35.841,00:19:37.467,"You fucked us, Pablo."
00:19:39.094,00:19:41.096,Not only you and me.
00:19:41.180,00:19:42.806,You fucked the whole family.
00:19:46.768,00:19:50.522,"But of course, since you needed to present yourself to Congress..."
00:19:52.566,00:19:57.696,"since you want to be president of this motherfucking country, the rest of us get screwed, isn't that right?"
00:20:03.744,00:20:05.370,But what the fuck...
00:20:06.914,00:20:09.208,"a man only dies once, right?"
00:20:42.908,00:20:49.706,"on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time, he got our message... and I hope it really pissed him off."
00:20:49.790,00:20:53.877,"You may have 800 houses, my friend, but none of them is home."
00:20:53.961,00:21:00.092,"We will keep you on the run for the rest of your life, or until we catch you... or kill you."
00:21:00.175,00:21:02.678,"From now on, nowhere is safe."
00:21:24.199,00:21:26.535,while we searched the finca from top to bottom.
00:21:28.161,00:21:31.832,The dirt-poor cops were astounded by the luxury.
00:21:32.040,00:21:36.628,"Hey, if you're risking your life for $22 a week... you'd pig out, too."
00:21:38.130,00:21:43.510,There's an old saying in law enforcement: The bad guys need to get lucky every time.
00:21:43.593,00:21:46.096,The good guys just need to get lucky once.
00:21:47.139,00:21:52.269,"And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit, I got very lucky."
00:21:52.936,00:21:57.065,The address I found led us to a nondescript building in downtown Medellín.
00:21:57.149,00:21:59.901,"We raided it, and guess who we found?"
00:22:00.986,00:22:02.154,Blackbeard.
00:22:02.237,00:22:05.615,Pablo's number one accountant and keeper of all secrets.
00:22:06.533,00:22:13.123,"In custody, he would describe a cocaine empire that was bringing in $60 million a day."
00:22:13.206,00:22:16.001,Pablo was bigger than General Motors.
00:22:16.084,00:22:25.343,"The mountain of evidence filled an entire room in the Palace of Justice, home of Colombia's supreme court, the only place thought safe enough to store it."
00:22:26.887,00:22:31.141,We had enough evidence to put him away for 100 lifetimes.
00:22:36.480,00:22:38.523,- What's up? - Jaramillo's running the show.
00:22:38.607,00:22:40.776,He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.
00:22:40.859,00:22:43.195,He's not letting us make any copies of anything.
00:22:43.278,00:22:45.405,"Javi, there's some good stuff in here, stuff we can use."
00:22:47.866,00:22:53.455,The narcos have been paying some guy named Ellis McPickle - to run coke all over the place. - Ellis McPickle?
00:23:02.255,00:23:03.423,Take 'em.
00:23:04.883,00:23:07.594,- What? - Just stuff 'em down your pants.
00:23:07.677,00:23:09.638,What are you talking about?
00:23:18.105,00:23:20.565,- They won't suspect you. - What if they search me?
00:23:20.649,00:23:22.359,"They're not gonna search a white boy, OK?"
00:23:22.442,00:23:24.694,- You're a guest in their country. - Guests don't steal.
00:23:24.778,00:23:25.862,Just do it.
00:23:27.823,00:23:30.492,Sometimes you gotta do bad things to catch bad people.
00:23:33.703,00:23:34.955,...help you do good things.
00:23:38.667,00:23:42.712,A cashier's check payable to Ellis McPickle.
00:23:44.297,00:23:45.257,Yes.
00:23:46.299,00:23:50.387,I've heard that name mentioned in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.
00:23:50.470,00:23:51.972,"Obviously, it's an alias."
00:23:56.059,00:23:58.311,Because he's not Colombian.
00:23:58.520,00:24:03.900,He's an American pilot who transports tons of cocaine for the cartel.
00:24:03.984,00:24:05.735,- A gringo? - Mm-hm.
00:24:06.611,00:24:09.906,- What's his name? - We don't know.
00:24:09.990,00:24:14.536,But we do know that Gustavo frequently mentions McPickle.
00:24:17.122,00:24:23.044,"Suarez, do you ever worry what will happen to you if Pablo finds out that you work for both sides?"
00:24:24.045,00:24:26.756,- I'm on your side. - Yeah?
00:24:26.965,00:24:30.468,Then prove it. What else can you tell me about McPickle?
00:24:32.345,00:24:36.349,We have his photograph in some of our files.
00:24:36.433,00:24:40.312,But maybe you should check with the CIA. He started his career with them.
00:24:46.693,00:24:48.778,Wha-- What the fuck is this?
00:24:48.862,00:24:50.488,This is me giving you homework.
00:24:50.697,00:24:52.949,Former CIA pilot flying coke for the narcos.
00:24:53.158,00:24:54.784,And I need you to find out who it is.
00:24:54.993,00:24:57.746,"First off, I don't fucking work for you, Murphy, you hear me?"
00:24:57.829,00:25:00.707,- So don't come in here thinking that-- - Is that Barry Seal?
00:25:03.293,00:25:05.253,What's he up to these days?
00:25:05.337,00:25:06.630,Barry Seal.
00:25:17.098,00:25:19.768,"mind-altering chemicals, and pussy..."
00:25:22.479,00:25:26.691,But his expensive lifestyle also made him perfect narco material.
00:25:27.567,00:25:29.486,Finding Barry was easy.
00:25:29.569,00:25:32.656,We just had to stake out his favorite whorehouse.
00:25:35.283,00:25:37.869,A friend of mine told me about this place. I've never been here before.
00:25:40.163,00:25:41.289,"No, I'm serious."
00:25:56.263,00:25:58.515,"Come on, we got you a ride waiting over here."
00:26:08.733,00:26:10.402,"Have a seat, Barry."
00:26:15.031,00:26:19.119,You seem awful relaxed for someone who's facing life in the clink.
00:26:21.997,00:26:28.837,We got records from Escobar listing shipments from Medellín to Louisiana - to the tune of 500 tons? - Yeah.
00:26:28.920,00:26:33.633,"Yeah? Well, let's see if that holds up in court, huh?"
00:26:33.842,00:26:39.222,The funny thing is you can't make a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana without making a refueling stop.
00:26:39.431,00:26:42.642,"Yeah, according to the records, you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua."
00:26:43.977,00:26:45.270,The manifests don't lie.
00:26:45.353,00:26:53.236,"An ex-CIA man making stops in communist countries with or without cocaine, that would be considered treason by the US Justice Department, wouldn't it?"
00:26:57.282,00:26:58.616,Communist sympathizer.
00:26:58.700,00:27:02.579,"We're gonna wrap you up in a big, red bow and drop you right off at Reagan's doorstep."
00:27:02.662,00:27:07.792,"Using Cuba and Nicaragua as refueling stops for coke shipments, that's treason and trafficking."
00:27:08.001,00:27:10.253,"What's that, two life sentences for the price of one?"
00:27:15.550,00:27:19.596,"Well... see, I figured this day might come."
00:27:19.804,00:27:22.724,"Why don't you uncuff me, boys. I got something to show you."
00:27:22.807,00:27:23.933,Yeah? What's that?
00:27:24.017,00:27:26.728,It's what I call a get out of jail free card.
00:27:26.811,00:27:30.190,"Y'all gonna wanna see this. Come on, uncuff me."
00:27:32.859,00:27:36.821,loading cocaine on a tarmac in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?
00:27:36.905,00:27:46.623,"'Cause at the time, Nicaragua was governed by the communist Sandinistas, who were letting Escobar use their country as a landing strip for cocaine shipments to the US."
00:27:46.706,00:27:50.752,Colombian cocaine coming through a communist country and into America?
00:27:50.835,00:27:52.170,I couldn't have made that up.
00:27:54.214,00:27:57.008,"- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador. - Wait, wait, wait. No."
00:27:57.092,00:27:59.844,This leaks wide and Barry Seal is a dead man. We gotta be careful.
00:27:59.928,00:28:03.390,Why are you trying to protect some scumbag who's trafficked over 500 tons?
00:28:03.473,00:28:05.642,I have a code of ethics when it comes to informants.
00:28:05.725,00:28:09.187,But not when it comes to torturing suspects with hot coffee.
00:28:09.270,00:28:11.523,"- You know, I wouldn't judge Carrillo. - Why is that?"
00:28:11.606,00:28:15.110,You had a partner killed. He's had a dozen.
00:28:27.831,00:28:30.917,"but frankly, Barry Seal wasn't an informant."
00:28:31.000,00:28:36.548,He was just another busted trafficker who ratted on the guys he worked with... a snitch.
00:28:38.007,00:28:43.513,"If I could use the narco-communist connection to get the resources we needed, then fuck him."
00:28:43.722,00:28:45.932,"Strange bedfellows, indeed."
00:28:49.978,00:28:51.938,Washington is gonna go crazy.
00:28:52.772,00:28:54.441,"Thank you, Ambassador."
00:28:55.900,00:28:58.862,This has to be highly classified for the safety of the informant.
00:28:58.945,00:29:00.071,Of course.
00:29:02.407,00:29:03.366,Thank you.
00:29:10.582,00:29:14.461,Especially when a Marine colonel named Oliver North got his hands on the picture.
00:29:14.669,00:29:25.221,I know every American parent concerned about the drug problem will be outraged to learn that top Nicaraguan government officials are deeply involved in drug trafficking.
00:29:25.305,00:29:37.525,"This picture shows Federico Vaughan, a top aide to one of the nine comandantes who rule Nicaragua, loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics bound for the United States."
00:29:38.610,00:29:42.822,"No, there seems to be no crime to which the Sandinistas will not stoop."
00:29:46.242,00:29:48.369,and Escobar's reach was long.
00:29:48.453,00:29:51.080,Barry Seal refused federal protection...
00:29:53.249,00:29:56.294,...and met his end in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.
00:29:56.503,00:29:57.796,Whoops.
00:30:04.761,00:30:07.305,Motherfucker! I told you we had to be careful.
00:30:07.388,00:30:13.353,"- You got Barry Seal killed. - Peña, if he wanted a long life, - he should've worked at Kodak. - You're responsible for his death."
00:30:13.561,00:30:16.189,"I didn't kill him, Escobar did."
00:30:17.106,00:30:19.484,Now we can go after that motherfucker.
00:30:19.567,00:30:21.736,"Look on the bright side, man."
00:30:25.782,00:30:29.244,fighting the narcos was the same as fighting the commies.
00:30:29.327,00:30:32.956,We got a tidal wave of money and all the resources we needed.
00:30:33.039,00:30:40.505,"The US Southern Command in Panama sent us a care package: planes, helicopters, you fucking name it. Everything."
00:30:45.385,00:30:54.352,"Our resources and intel helped the Colombians raid labs all over the country and burn 'em straight to the ground, seizing over a billion dollars in coke."
00:30:54.561,00:30:57.480,"We were kicking ass, and the narcos were feeling it."
00:30:58.231,00:31:01.025,The price of cocaine in Miami was skyrocketing.
00:31:01.234,00:31:05.405,"Despite all this, we'd yet to net one of the Medellín kingpins..."
00:31:05.488,00:31:11.035,"till we put a tracking device on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether, the essential ingredient in cocaine processing."
00:31:11.244,00:31:12.161,Got it!
00:31:16.624,00:31:19.961,"Medellín's biggest processing lab, and we hit it hard."
00:31:20.169,00:31:23.381,The ensuing gun battle cost dozens of men...
00:31:23.464,00:31:30.597,"but in the end, it got us our biggest victory to date, the first of the Medellín kingpins: Carlos Lehder."
00:31:33.850,00:31:35.852,ten times this if you give me one hour.
00:31:52.827,00:31:57.248,Extradition worked. Carlos will die in an American jail.
00:31:58.750,00:32:02.378,And no one savored this victory more than the Colombians.
00:32:02.462,00:32:10.136,"For anti-narco candidate Luis Carlos Galán, it would provide him the momentum he needed to propel him to the presidency."
00:32:10.219,00:32:12.555,Extradition would become his battle cry.
00:32:16.267,00:32:17.602,Thank you.
00:32:28.112,00:32:34.953,But I have already presented a motion before the Supreme Court of Colombia against the legality of extradition.
00:32:35.036,00:32:39.958,They are examining it this week at the Palace of Justice.
00:32:40.041,00:32:42.627,Can we buy someone in that court?
00:32:43.711,00:32:45.797,"Unfortunately, no."
00:32:45.880,00:32:49.342,It's the only institution in this country that is incorruptible.
00:32:50.426,00:32:53.429,Let's pray that the ruling comes out in our favor.
00:32:53.513,00:32:59.769,"Brother... even after he's dead, Carlos still has a sentence of 135 years in prison."
00:32:59.852,00:33:01.771,He's totally fucked.
00:33:01.980,00:33:03.481,This is gringo bullshit.
00:33:03.564,00:33:07.360,That happened to him for speaking about the revolution on the radio.
00:33:07.568,00:33:09.696,"We're next, aren't we?"
00:33:09.904,00:33:11.781,You're right.
00:33:11.864,00:33:13.783,Pablito?
00:33:13.866,00:33:15.368,Do you have an answer or what?
00:33:19.455,00:33:25.003,"Well... in my opinion, a jail in the United States is worse than death."
00:33:25.753,00:33:29.257,We can never forget what happened to Carlos.
00:33:29.340,00:33:31.926,Carlos was one of us.
00:33:33.636,00:33:38.808,Fabio is right. The Americans are fucking us.
00:33:39.017,00:33:41.144,"But remember, there's something they want more than us."
00:33:41.227,00:33:44.355,"So, brothers..."
00:33:45.648,00:33:47.442,"it's time to give them what they want, isn't it?"
00:33:52.405,00:33:55.700,What you want isn't going to be easy. It's very risky.
00:33:55.783,00:34:00.163,It's going to require weapons and men. There will be casualties.
00:34:00.246,00:34:05.543,I understand what you want. How much are we talking about?
00:34:06.419,00:34:09.338,Two million US dollars.
00:34:10.339,00:34:12.050,It's very dangerous.
00:34:13.259,00:34:17.013,Fighting a revolution comes with sacrifice...
00:34:18.014,00:34:21.934,"and it goes without saying that it will dangerous, right?"
00:34:35.448,00:34:39.285,it is our duty to fight to the very end.
00:34:40.620,00:34:43.998,We have an historical obligation.
00:34:57.261,00:34:58.846,Meet Pablo Escobar.
00:35:01.641,00:35:02.934,Miss.
00:35:03.976,00:35:05.686,- OK. - We have a deal.
00:35:05.770,00:35:07.188,"All right, then."
00:35:08.022,00:35:10.441,We were just leaving.
00:35:10.525,00:35:11.859,Good night.
00:35:19.200,00:35:21.494,What the hell is this?
00:35:21.577,00:35:23.704,Why are you meeting with Escobar?
00:35:23.788,00:35:27.500,We made a deal... obviously for money.
00:35:28.584,00:35:30.294,In exchange for what?
00:35:30.503,00:35:34.924,"Unless you are willing to be part of it, I cannot say."
00:35:37.510,00:35:42.014,"It's a partnership, necessary for the revolutionary fight."
00:35:42.098,00:35:46.477,I fight for the people... not for drug traffickers.
00:36:03.494,00:36:05.329,Elisa? What's going on?
00:36:06.247,00:36:07.665,- I need to talk to you. - About what?
00:36:07.748,00:36:09.750,You told me your husband works at the embassy.
00:36:09.834,00:36:11.043,Yeah.
00:36:11.252,00:36:12.879,I need you to speak with him and warn him.
00:36:12.962,00:36:14.172,About what?
00:36:14.380,00:36:18.342,Pablo Escobar is planning something with a communist group called the M-19.
00:36:18.551,00:36:20.469,"I don't know what it is, but I know it's gonna be bad."
00:36:20.553,00:36:23.556,"Wait, Pablo Escobar? How do you know anything about Escobar?"
00:36:23.764,00:36:27.185,I-- I just know. You need to warn him...
00:36:27.268,00:36:28.728,and you need to hide me.
00:36:30.062,00:36:31.647,OK. Come on.
00:36:35.193,00:36:38.154,"Steve's already at work, but Javi lives downstairs."
00:36:46.829,00:36:48.497,I just hope he's here.
00:36:51.292,00:36:53.544,"- Well, what have we here? - I'll explain later."
00:36:53.628,00:36:55.129,I'll be right back. Go.
00:37:01.886,00:37:04.847,...hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks they're gonna do something terrible.
00:37:04.931,00:37:07.266,- Slow down. - Escobar is using members of M-19.
00:37:07.350,00:37:09.769,- Say that again? - Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.
00:37:09.852,00:37:11.020,Escobar and M-19?
00:37:11.103,00:37:13.397,"She didn't tell me any details, just that it would be bad."
00:37:13.481,00:37:15.399,No... that doesn't make any sense.
00:37:15.483,00:37:18.277,"She asked me to hide her, so I took her to Javi's apartment."
00:37:18.361,00:37:19.403,OK. All right.
00:37:32.792,00:37:33.793,- Agent Murphy! - All right.
00:37:34.001,00:37:49.976,"Ambassador, I got information with Escobar and M-19. I think they're-- Financed by Escobar, the M-19 guerrillas stormed the Palace of Justice and occupied the supreme court."
00:37:50.184,00:37:57.024,They took over 100 hostages and made a bunch of demands about the redistribution of wealth and an end to injustice and tyranny...
00:37:57.233,00:37:58.776,but it was all bullshit.
00:37:59.777,00:38:01.112,The military attacked.
00:38:01.320,00:38:06.617,"Dozens of lives were lost in the carnage, including half of Colombia's supreme court justices."
00:38:07.785,00:38:09.245,Most of the M-19 were killed.
00:38:09.453,00:38:20.881,"Some escaped... but not before accomplishing their true goal: setting fire to the room that contained 600,000 pages of evidence against Escobar."
00:38:22.091,00:38:24.635,The entire case against him turned to ash.
00:38:28.764,00:38:34.312,"In the United States, the Mafia makes witnesses disappear so they can't testify in court."
00:38:35.730,00:38:39.775,"In Colombia, Pablo Escobar made the whole court disappear."
00:38:46.198,00:38:48.743,as cannon shells exploded inside.
00:38:55.666,00:38:58.085,"- Where is she? - Well, come on in."
00:38:58.294,00:39:01.505,"You, up! Who in the fuck is she and why is the military after her?"
00:39:01.589,00:39:02.882,Put the gun away.
00:39:03.841,00:39:05.051,Put it away.
00:39:06.260,00:39:08.262,She told me who she is. Put the gun away.
00:39:08.346,00:39:10.514,"- Can I say something? - No, you may not."
00:39:10.598,00:39:14.143,Murphy... calm down.
00:39:15.394,00:39:17.855,I have no idea why you'd get yourself involved in this.
00:39:17.938,00:39:20.107,Your wife brought her to me.
00:39:21.817,00:39:26.655,"I appreciate you putting yourself out there for my wife, I truly do, but why are we risking our whole careers over this woman?"
00:39:26.739,00:39:29.658,Because she can prove that Pablo was behind the palace siege.
00:39:32.370,00:39:35.915,"If she can tie Escobar to the siege, I say we bring her in."
00:39:35.998,00:39:37.583,"Well, she's M-19."
00:39:37.666,00:39:41.379,Noonan would have to turn her over to the Colombian military and then she gets disappeared.
00:39:41.462,00:39:43.714,I'd like to avoid another Barry Seal situation.
00:39:43.798,00:39:45.925,So we're gonna harbor a communist fugitive?
00:39:46.008,00:39:48.344,"Look, all she did was warn us."
00:39:48.427,00:39:50.888,She's not on anybody's radar.
00:39:50.971,00:39:53.057,She's not involved in anything.
00:39:56.769,00:40:03.567,The red X's you see in these pictures indicate M-19 revolutionaries terminated by the Colombian Special Forces.
00:40:03.776,00:40:07.696,The remaining individuals you see are fugitives.
00:40:10.491,00:40:13.994,"This was Escobar, classic. He's cut a deal with M-19."
00:40:15.287,00:40:17.832,Next you'll tell us Escobar sank the Titanic.
00:40:18.040,00:40:21.043,Was it coincidence the extradition evidence against him was destroyed?
00:40:21.252,00:40:23.462,"He doesn't hold grudges, not if it suits his purposes."
00:40:23.546,00:40:27.466,- How do you know he cut a deal? - We have a confidential informant.
00:40:27.675,00:40:30.094,"You willing to identify this informant, Agent Peña?"
00:40:30.177,00:40:33.889,"- No, I am not. - Needless to say..."
00:40:33.973,00:40:39.770,Southern Command has rescinded its offer of resources to the DEA in light of this communist aggression.
00:40:39.854,00:40:44.775,We need to target the M-19 leadership: Ivan the Terrible Torres and Elisa Alvarez.
00:41:08.174,00:41:10.134,What did you expect?
00:41:10.217,00:41:12.178,That it would be any different?
00:41:15.681,00:41:18.726,You did a very good job.
00:41:32.406,00:41:35.993,You can't imagine how much this is going to help our cause.
00:41:36.202,00:41:39.246,"No, brother. The truth is, you helped mine."
00:41:42.416,00:41:43.959,"You, Ivan..."
00:41:45.044,00:41:48.297,gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.
00:41:50.090,00:41:52.843,The same one that freed this country.
00:41:58.682,00:42:00.434,Now it belongs to you.
00:42:04.980,00:42:10.361,"With it, you will continue the fight... to free this country."
00:42:13.572,00:42:16.534,"I promise you, I will continue the fight."
00:42:16.742,00:42:18.702,"You earned it, brother."
00:42:20.204,00:42:21.997,As for me...
00:42:23.332,00:42:25.334,I'll be in Panama until this blows over.
00:42:26.377,00:42:34.385,We are also-- Make sure you grab the briefcase.
00:42:36.136,00:42:37.763,And the fucking sword.
00:00:24.566,00:00:30.572,the New Liberalism party is the only force in Colombia that is not afraid of narcotraffickers.
00:00:41.708,00:00:43.710,...intimidation through violence...
00:00:53.428,00:00:55.722,Just making sure he gets it right.
00:01:03.688,00:01:06.483,"- Mm. - Look, I brought you this."
00:01:06.566,00:01:07.984,What's this?
00:01:08.068,00:01:12.781,Clean socks. Your wife dropped them off before we left.
00:01:14.991,00:01:16.284,How's Galán doing?
00:01:19.829,00:01:23.333,I wish he didn't focus so much on extradition of narcos.
00:01:27.337,00:01:28.963,Galán's got some balls.
00:01:33.802,00:01:39.599,"Well, then, you don't have to worry... do you?"
00:01:42.602,00:01:43.978,Aah...
00:01:44.896,00:01:46.189,Pass me the socks.
00:03:21.826,00:03:24.245,- OK. - There's an orphanage in Cumaral.
00:03:24.329,00:03:27.415,It's out of the guerrilla zone and away from the narcos.
00:03:27.498,00:03:28.833,And then what?
00:03:30.001,00:03:31.336,We get you a passport.
00:03:33.212,00:03:36.174,"From another country, we can depose you about Escobar and the siege."
00:03:37.383,00:03:40.970,"You may have run away from your country, but I'm not running away from mine."
00:03:54.192,00:03:56.236,This is about keeping you alive.
00:04:04.077,00:04:05.954,I'm not your responsibility.
00:04:10.541,00:04:14.504,If Pablo Escobar finds you... he'll kill you in a heartbeat.
00:04:17.799,00:04:19.509,Not if I kill him first.
00:04:25.515,00:04:28.559,She's the only witness we got that can tie Escobar to the palace massacre.
00:04:28.643,00:04:33.564,Hard to bring her in when she gets turned over to the Colombians and she gets disappeared. Are you ready for that?
00:04:33.648,00:04:34.857,No.
00:04:34.941,00:04:36.734,"So what's our options, since we have none?"
00:04:36.818,00:04:43.074,"Well, we keep her in hiding until things cool down, and get her immunity in exchange for her testimony-- Are you gonna get us immunity?"
00:04:45.743,00:04:50.456,"Well, the next time your wife decides to bring home a human hand grenade, how about she hands it to you?"
00:04:53.001,00:04:54.961,Are you fucking her?
00:04:56.212,00:04:57.797,Sleep with a communist?
00:04:58.798,00:05:00.842,That would be downright un-American.
00:05:07.515,00:05:10.560,that Escobar is behind the Palace of Justice siege?
00:05:10.643,00:05:12.103,"No, ma'am."
00:05:12.186,00:05:16.983,"Agent Peña claims to have an informant that can testify to that effect, but he hasn't brought him forward."
00:05:24.032,00:05:32.373,"The other one is Ernesto Sobrino, a radical priest who gave shelter to M-19 fugitives in Los Altos comuna."
00:05:32.540,00:05:34.709,Is one of these people your informant?
00:05:34.876,00:05:39.005,"Ambassador, this is... unofficial wiretap information."
00:05:40.048,00:05:42.383,"We, uh, intercepted a discussion between narcos."
00:05:51.267,00:05:53.644,The... connection was bad. They were calling from Panama.
00:05:53.811,00:06:00.526,"- Panama? - They know Galán's gonna win and they know that he'll support extradition, and they're not gonna sit around and await being sent back to the US."
00:06:00.693,00:06:06.866,"Ambassador, word is Manuel Noriega is providing safe harbor for the narcos, and possibly shipping points for their cocaine."
00:06:09.202,00:06:11.746,"That's horseshit, Peña. Excuse me, Ambassador."
00:06:11.829,00:06:15.666,"On one hand, you're saying Escobar's in bed with left-wing communists."
00:06:15.750,00:06:17.960,Now you're saying he's in bed with Manuel Noriega.
00:06:18.795,00:06:20.546,"You can't have it both ways, son."
00:06:20.630,00:06:26.511,"Ambassador, Manuel Noriega has helped us fight communism all over Latin America for the last two decades."
00:06:26.677,00:06:30.932,I take great offense at any attempt by the DEA to smear his good name.
00:06:34.477,00:06:36.395,"Right wing, left wing..."
00:06:36.479,00:06:39.941,"For Manuel Noriega, it was all about the money."
00:06:40.858,00:06:49.575,"When Bush was head of the CIA, Noriega pretended to be a commie hater so the US would ignore the fact that he was heavily involved as a drug trafficker."
00:06:49.659,00:06:56.958,"When Noriega realized he could make even more money shipping his drugs by siding with communists, he switched teams."
00:06:57.041,00:07:01.129,"So, we invaded Panama, and arrested Old Pineapple Face."
00:07:02.130,00:07:03.798,"But, that was later."
00:07:03.881,00:07:11.389,"For now, the trusted friend and ally was a right-wing CIA asset who was taking money from Bush... and right from the narcos."
00:07:16.686,00:07:21.107,Pablo had knocked off half the Colombian Supreme Court to fight extradition.
00:07:21.190,00:07:25.319,"And now, he was offering to pay off Colombia's national debt in exchange for a truce."
00:07:26.696,00:07:28.281,Guess he missed home.
00:07:48.885,00:07:53.181,and can't even get a decent meal anywhere.
00:07:53.264,00:07:58.811,"Listen, the problem isn't the food, the problem is Noriega."
00:07:58.936,00:08:02.356,"First chance he gets, he'll sell us to the Americans."
00:08:02.440,00:08:03.774,You guys stay calm.
00:08:03.858,00:08:06.861,"Once we reach an agreement with the government, we'll be back in our homeland."
00:08:12.408,00:08:14.744,I'd rather go live in Spain.
00:08:19.373,00:08:22.543,"No, sir, none of that. War is bad for business."
00:08:22.627,00:08:24.921,We will negotiate with them as Pablo agreed.
00:08:33.763,00:08:35.806,if he hadn't started killing politicians and judges.
00:08:38.392,00:08:41.479,Do you want to sit here and cry over spilled milk?
00:08:45.483,00:08:49.612,"Sometimes, I think you kill these men because they won't let you in their club."
00:08:49.820,00:08:52.532,"You better watch your mouth, asshole."
00:09:10.675,00:09:14.929,The Colombian government has refused our amnesty offer.
00:09:16.597,00:09:19.267,"Get used to the food, gentlemen."
00:09:21.394,00:09:23.229,It's not safe to go back home.
00:09:46.752,00:09:49.255,They've rejected our amnesty deal.
00:09:52.592,00:09:54.468,We may have to stay.
00:09:59.015,00:10:00.683,I hate this place.
00:10:03.811,00:10:05.980,We can go someplace else.
00:10:09.567,00:10:11.902,"In Switzerland, we are nobody, Pablo."
00:10:12.987,00:10:16.407,What good is having all the money in the world if you can't go home?
00:10:24.206,00:10:28.461,If we go back... I'm going to have to fight.
00:10:36.594,00:10:39.180,"Do whatever is necessary, my love."
00:10:53.903,00:10:56.364,The decision that would change Colombia forever.
00:11:04.830,00:11:07.875,"In my opinion, the outcome is decided."
00:11:07.958,00:11:11.212,My question is... why do you keep getting involved with the narcos?
00:11:12.463,00:11:14.340,I want a country at peace.
00:11:15.383,00:11:17.134,"And if I don't do it, who will?"
00:11:18.010,00:11:19.637,You're backing them into a corner.
00:11:21.013,00:11:22.932,I'm wearing a vest.
00:11:23.933,00:11:26.060,I'm afraid that a bulletproof vest...
00:11:26.143,00:11:29.563,isn't enough to ensure that you have a future.
00:11:31.816,00:11:35.277,"Don't worry, my friend. There will be a future."
00:11:52.294,00:11:56.048,"against the advice of his campaign manager, César Gaviria."
00:12:08.102,00:12:11.105,"For a brief shining moment, there was hope..."
00:12:12.064,00:12:14.692,extinguished by the pull of an assassin's trigger.
00:12:16.694,00:12:22.158,"To mourn Galán's death, every hut in the countryside lit a candle in remembrance..."
00:12:23.159,00:12:30.875,"and in the cities, thousands took to the streets in a march of the silent, a mute protest against the violence of the narcos."
00:12:32.543,00:12:37.006,With Galán's murder... came the end of hope for a peaceful future.
00:12:46.932,00:12:48.601,Galán's dead.
00:12:49.435,00:12:51.312,"You had him killed, didn't you?"
00:12:52.354,00:12:54.690,"You didn't tell us shit, and you killed him, you son of a bitch."
00:12:54.773,00:12:57.485,"- I want to go home, Fabio. - Home?"
00:12:57.651,00:13:00.112,Why are we going home? So they can capture us?
00:13:01.947,00:13:06.368,"All this shit you talk about partnership, and then you do this on your own? Huh?"
00:13:12.416,00:13:15.169,Galán was the only threat.
00:13:15.920,00:13:18.964,There is no one left to challenge us.
00:13:19.048,00:13:20.508,"And you know why, Fabio."
00:13:21.467,00:13:24.512,Because no one has the balls that we have.
00:13:35.272,00:13:37.942,Who would have the balls to fill Galán's shoes?
00:13:43.656,00:13:50.704,"As the people now rise and call for justice, I pray to God that this sacrifice will serve at last..."
00:13:52.122,00:13:56.669,as motivation for society to react and bond...
00:13:56.752,00:14:02.091,to support the government... and institutions...
00:14:02.174,00:14:14.562,"while also demanding a more effective leadership, one undeterred by the hitmen, the hijackings, or any other manifestations of violence."
00:14:14.645,00:14:23.279,"My father, Luis Carlos Galán, will be remembered for awakening the Colombian people to the danger of the narcos."
00:14:25.197,00:14:29.493,The assassin's bullets... will not stop what my father began.
00:14:30.452,00:14:34.582,"As he fell, another rises in his place."
00:14:34.790,00:14:38.544,I want to tell Dr. César Gaviria...
00:14:39.670,00:14:42.631,"in the name of the people of Colombia, and my family..."
00:14:43.591,00:14:48.345,"that we entrust my father's ideals to him, and that he can count on our support..."
00:14:48.554,00:14:52.600,to become the president Colombia wants and needs.
00:14:55.561,00:14:59.106,"Dr. César Gaviria, save Colombia!"
00:15:15.956,00:15:19.835,"If he took Galán's position on extradition, the narcos would declare war."
00:15:20.002,00:15:23.714,"If he didn't, the country would become a narco state."
00:15:35.976,00:15:38.395,Let it go to the answering machine.
00:15:46.570,00:15:48.739,I wish it would stop ringing.
00:15:48.822,00:15:52.284,It's your friends. They're calling to offer support.
00:15:53.994,00:15:57.373,Or opinions about what I should do.
00:15:59.375,00:16:01.794,Why can't you run without backing extradition?
00:16:06.799,00:16:09.927,- I wrote those speeches. - Yes...
00:16:11.178,00:16:12.680,but do you even believe in them?
00:16:16.350,00:16:18.268,I don't know what I believe.
00:16:19.937,00:16:22.690,I don't want the narcos having free reign.
00:16:24.483,00:16:27.903,But I don't want the United States involved in our affairs.
00:16:28.946,00:16:30.698,So say nothing.
00:16:32.533,00:16:34.827,That's the best way to stay alive.
00:16:53.178,00:16:56.765,"Fernando, cheer up. Have a drink."
00:16:56.932,00:16:58.726,We're going home!
00:17:03.564,00:17:06.066,"- How are you? Hm? - Fine, my love."
00:17:07.985,00:17:09.570,What about you?
00:17:09.653,00:17:10.696,Give me one.
00:17:12.948,00:17:14.199,"Margarita, right?"
00:17:15.075,00:17:16.243,Let's see.
00:17:18.412,00:17:20.414,"- Son of a bitch, that's good. - Right?"
00:17:20.497,00:17:24.293,"Thank you. Listen, I've got a question for you."
00:17:27.504,00:17:29.965,We're walking into a world of shit.
00:17:30.049,00:17:33.177,"Relax, brother."
00:17:33.260,00:17:37.765,Spain's too far away to protect our interests.
00:17:37.848,00:17:41.351,We have a better chance of influencing Pablo at home.
00:17:46.815,00:17:48.942,Don't you get it?
00:17:54.406,00:17:56.700,He's taking us to the slaughter.
00:18:24.937,00:18:26.396,How's business?
00:18:26.480,00:18:32.027,"Fucking Noriega is charging us a fortune, but we got 175 tons to Miami."
00:18:32.820,00:18:36.406,Gacha's Mexican routes are opening up Los Angeles.
00:18:37.908,00:18:41.036,"But do you know what matters most for our business, Pablo?"
00:18:42.204,00:18:45.958,That the situation at home stays calm. Know what I mean?
00:18:46.041,00:18:47.292,Sure.
00:19:06.061,00:19:09.064,You would have tried to talk me out of it.
00:19:09.148,00:19:10.524,Yes.
00:19:12.860,00:19:14.194,I would have tried.
00:19:16.780,00:19:19.908,The amount of money we are losing is because of that bullshit.
00:19:23.579,00:19:24.913,Are you listening?
00:19:26.123,00:19:28.167,"Look at those peaks, Gustavo."
00:19:34.131,00:19:38.135,I'll die... before I ever leave Colombia again.
00:19:48.729,00:19:50.397,I understand the narcos are back from Panama.
00:19:54.943,00:19:56.361,it could get back to Pablo.
00:19:58.197,00:20:01.158,So I started this to monitor Pablo's sicarios' communications.
00:20:01.241,00:20:03.827,"SAT phones, landlines, you name it."
00:20:03.911,00:20:08.290,"I've got dozens of wiretaps, but I've only managed to seize about ten kilos in the last month."
00:20:08.373,00:20:11.501,Probably because I've listened to my own men tipping the narcos off.
00:20:13.921,00:20:16.548,I listen to them tell their girlfriends they're afraid...
00:20:16.632,00:20:19.218,cry to their mothers when one of our men gets shot down.
00:20:20.552,00:20:23.639,But every once in a while... I hear them trade secrets with Pablo.
00:20:24.932,00:20:27.017,Do your bosses know you're doing this?
00:20:27.809,00:20:29.311,I trust them even less.
00:20:30.187,00:20:35.317,"Most of my men are from here, where they can get to your mother, your aunt, your cousin."
00:20:36.109,00:20:40.781,How do I fight... when my soldiers are already working for Escobar?
00:20:42.366,00:20:44.326,"Well, do they have to be from Medellín?"
00:20:56.713,00:20:59.132,- Really? - Mm.
00:20:59.216,00:21:00.634,I prefer the gray.
00:21:01.593,00:21:08.267,"Red is the color of the party, and it makes you more... sociable and close to the people."
00:21:08.350,00:21:11.436,- That's important. - Mm.
00:21:13.313,00:21:15.774,I wonder what Luis Carlos would have chosen?
00:21:17.484,00:21:20.696,"You know, we should also hire an image consultant."
00:21:21.613,00:21:27.494,"We have to make you more appealing to the youth, give you a more modern look."
00:21:27.661,00:21:29.579,Now you are going to give me image advice?
00:21:29.663,00:21:31.498,I'm just thinking about the polls.
00:21:33.208,00:21:34.501,Anyway...
00:21:36.461,00:21:41.341,"Galán had professionals at his side, but which could he trust?"
00:21:41.425,00:21:43.218,Hm?
00:21:43.302,00:21:46.680,"And you know perfectly well that you can trust me, right?"
00:21:46.763,00:21:48.223,Mm-hm.
00:21:50.142,00:21:53.020,"Well, what are you going to choose, red or gray?"
00:22:01.737,00:22:04.573,Luis Carlos said something to me before he died.
00:22:06.450,00:22:07.951,There will be a future.
00:22:11.455,00:22:13.665,Now let's see what kind of future it is.
00:22:22.507,00:22:27.220,The idea that he's a presidential candidate shows you our sad state of affairs.
00:22:28.638,00:22:30.807,I need to know which side he is on.
00:22:32.017,00:22:34.936,He speaks with the Foreign Press next week.
00:22:35.020,00:22:36.980,They'll certainly ask his position.
00:22:37.064,00:22:39.775,"Don't worry, Pablo. He'll be easy to influence."
00:22:39.858,00:22:41.276,"- No, I disagree. - Why?"
00:22:45.238,00:22:54.289,"I found him sitting in the parking lot in his beat-up Renault, eating a bag of apples... and reading economic reform textbooks."
00:22:54.498,00:22:57.167,He was testifying to the cabinet and wanted to be ready.
00:22:57.250,00:23:00.587,"He's a bookworm, not a leader."
00:23:00.670,00:23:02.964,"- No-- No-- - No, no, no, you're missing my point."
00:23:03.048,00:23:05.008,- No. - He's not an oligarch.
00:23:06.218,00:23:08.095,He's from modest circumstances.
00:23:08.178,00:23:10.097,"Like you, he's worked for everything he has."
00:23:11.264,00:23:13.558,You have to be careful with people like that.
00:23:28.532,00:23:33.995,What we have to decide is do we stick with Pablo... or chart our own course?
00:23:36.998,00:23:39.292,We should talk to our friends down south.
00:23:39.459,00:23:43.964,"No, no. It's not time. No. Mm?"
00:23:46.925,00:23:48.510,Have you seen Marina?
00:23:48.593,00:23:50.178,She told me she was going to buy a new brush.
00:23:50.262,00:23:53.014,You know your sister.
00:24:03.817,00:24:06.153,You have no idea how much I wanted to go down on you in Panama.
00:24:06.236,00:24:07.571,- Yeah? - Yeah.
00:24:07.654,00:24:11.074,I could tell that you really wanted to.
00:24:11.158,00:24:13.660,"- Come here, baby. - You are very patient."
00:24:13.743,00:24:15.036,"Yes, of course."
00:24:15.996,00:24:18.999,"All your people were there, your brothers..."
00:24:27.465,00:24:30.218,My brothers are driving me crazy.
00:24:33.180,00:24:34.306,- You know what? - What?
00:24:36.975,00:24:39.269,"If they want to, they can go live in Spain..."
00:24:49.738,00:24:51.406,Let's not hide anymore.
00:24:55.493,00:24:56.745,All right.
00:25:04.711,00:25:06.504,Ask Pablo to do us a favor.
00:25:07.839,00:25:11.176,"Just like he took care of Galán, he can take care of your wife."
00:25:19.476,00:25:20.936,You...
00:25:21.770,00:25:24.522,are very evil for such a young girl.
00:25:29.361,00:25:31.905,"You've moved up, Fernando."
00:25:33.531,00:25:38.954,From government minister to Pablo Escobar's errand boy.
00:25:40.580,00:25:43.083,I guess the pay is much better.
00:25:43.875,00:25:45.752,I'm not doing this for the money.
00:25:46.711,00:25:51.383,What country sends its own citizens to an iron tomb in the United States?
00:25:52.300,00:25:53.969,I understand your dilemma.
00:25:54.052,00:25:59.933,"Speak out in favor, you're seen as a US puppet and you might not win the election."
00:26:00.976,00:26:04.437,"Speak out against, you anger the US..."
00:26:05.480,00:26:08.483,and are criticized by our media as a shill of the narcos.
00:26:08.566,00:26:12.070,"César, I was thinking I would love to dedicate a program for your campaign."
00:26:12.237,00:26:15.991,"It would be an honor for me, and would benefit us both."
00:26:18.034,00:26:19.452,What a great idea.
00:26:20.287,00:26:22.956,"You guys are really shameless, aren't you?"
00:26:24.124,00:26:27.919,"- How do you sleep at night? - César, it doesn't have to be this way."
00:26:28.086,00:26:34.050,"If Luis had been as smart as you, perhaps we could have avoided this horrible tragedy."
00:26:36.636,00:26:37.971,We could have had peace.
00:26:38.138,00:26:39.389,Easy.
00:26:44.394,00:26:45.562,Get out.
00:26:46.813,00:26:48.606,Read Pablo's letter.
00:26:49.733,00:26:51.818,Maybe you will have a future.
00:27:07.584,00:27:13.214,"He's gonna talk. And when he does, I hope you DEA boys understand what's important in this hemisphere."
00:27:14.132,00:27:16.718,"Well, how about you, uh... clue us in?"
00:27:16.801,00:27:20.305,"Drug dealers, I mean, bad as they are, they want your money."
00:27:21.097,00:27:22.432,Communists want everything.
00:27:23.058,00:27:27.937,"I don't know about you, Peña, but I... I like to own shit."
00:27:28.146,00:27:29.397,Right.
00:27:30.815,00:27:32.067,"Good talk, Lou."
00:27:32.150,00:27:35.153,"- Very, uh... enlightening. - Yeah."
00:27:36.237,00:27:37.322,Oh...
00:27:39.449,00:27:42.327,This... priest?
00:27:43.161,00:27:46.664,If it comes out that he was your informant and you protected him...
00:27:47.791,00:27:49.459,I'm gonna make sure you're tried for treason.
00:28:00.095,00:28:02.013,So he did what he does best.
00:28:02.222,00:28:06.810,Let me guess: it's a very sad and complicated situation involving you and a beautiful local.
00:28:06.893,00:28:10.647,"You got your nails done. It's-- It's your color, Colleen."
00:28:11.898,00:28:13.441,"- What do you want, Javier? - It's simple."
00:28:13.525,00:28:15.985,I just need your signature... right there.
00:28:17.278,00:28:19.489,You want me to create an embassy ID?
00:28:19.572,00:28:24.411,- Who is this woman? - What I want you to do is sidestep a little bullshit bureaucracy and help someone stay alive.
00:28:25.912,00:28:28.706,You really think I'd be asking you if it wasn't important?
00:28:28.790,00:28:30.500,She's my informant.
00:28:30.583,00:28:35.213,"And she could be the key to bringing down the whole Medellín cartel, so come on, Colleen, whose side are you on?"
00:28:54.607,00:28:55.900,Where were you?
00:28:57.068,00:28:58.695,- In the office. - In the office?
00:28:58.778,00:28:59.904,Yes.
00:29:00.739,00:29:02.532,Is that where you were?
00:29:05.785,00:29:07.287,That's weird...
00:29:08.246,00:29:11.583,because I called and they said you hadn't been in all day.
00:29:11.791,00:29:15.545,"I don't know which office you called, but I was there."
00:29:15.628,00:29:20.759,"They're seizing everything, Pablo. All the accounts-- We knew there would be a reaction with Galán, right?"
00:29:20.967,00:29:22.844,Yeah.
00:29:22.927,00:29:24.804,"Relax, Gustavo."
00:29:26.264,00:29:29.058,"Relax, because everything will calm down later."
00:29:39.027,00:29:41.863,What are you gonna do? Are you gonna kill us both?
00:29:41.946,00:29:45.074,- You afraid to die? - No. Are you?
00:29:53.374,00:29:55.835,- Put it out. - Where were you?
00:29:56.044,00:29:57.754,"Put it out, Pablo."
00:29:59.339,00:30:00.715,"Put it out, Pablo!"
00:30:09.682,00:30:10.975,Are you with me or what?
00:30:13.770,00:30:15.647,And when have I not been with you?
00:30:19.692,00:30:22.654,"From the beginning, it has been you and me."
00:30:25.532,00:30:28.076,I cannot do this without you.
00:30:32.455,00:30:34.874,"Are you doubting my loyalty, Pablo?"
00:30:37.669,00:30:39.087,No.
00:30:42.090,00:30:45.802,But I'm having serious doubts about the Ochoas.
00:31:14.831,00:31:16.958,The terms were simple.
00:31:17.166,00:31:20.920,He promised peace if the narcos were left alone...
00:31:21.129,00:31:24.966,and if not... he promised all-out war.
00:31:30.722,00:31:35.435,Carrillo with his wiretaps knew a storm was on the horizon.
00:31:36.311,00:31:39.439,Pablo became his duty and his obsession.
00:31:40.064,00:31:50.658,"He came to recognize Pablo's voice, his sleep patterns, what he liked to eat, his tastes in art, his love of silk sheets, and his favorite music."
00:32:05.214,00:32:06.674,when you'd hear him over the airwaves.
00:32:11.054,00:32:14.349,But did she know how easily he ordered his men to kill?
00:32:23.274,00:32:25.068,But did we score a goal?
00:32:29.405,00:32:31.699,Let's make sure we score a goal on him as well.
00:32:34.869,00:32:35.870,"Come on, come on."
00:32:35.954,00:32:38.456,"If you spoke out against him, you were dead."
00:32:45.046,00:32:47.423,"and his reporter, Luis Camacho."
00:32:48.132,00:32:52.887,"Jaime Rodríguez, the former head of the anti-drug squad before Carrillo."
00:32:52.971,00:32:55.431,The drumbeat went on and on.
00:32:55.515,00:32:58.226,"For Carrillo, the war had already started."
00:32:58.309,00:33:00.228,But he just couldn't trust his army.
00:33:03.856,00:33:05.608,- I don't give a fuck. - Excuse me?
00:33:05.692,00:33:08.611,Horacio... don't give up.
00:33:09.487,00:33:13.157,You've always been the leader of the persecution of Pablo Escobar.
00:33:15.451,00:33:17.495,This operation could be a failure before it starts.
00:33:17.578,00:33:19.872,I'm not here for fun.
00:33:19.956,00:33:25.086,What's gonna happen is the defense minister will give you credit for the evidence that we found at Hacienda Nápoles.
00:33:25.169,00:33:29.215,"So... then if you resign, I will look really bad."
00:33:29.298,00:33:31.426,Is that what you're doing? Is that what you want?
00:33:31.509,00:33:38.433,"Horacio... you remember when we were cadets, we never thought they would call us to lead the country's most important unit."
00:33:39.267,00:33:42.353,"Horacio, as your friend... I'm asking you to think about it."
00:33:42.437,00:33:44.981,"Rodrigo, I don't even know who Pablo pays."
00:33:45.815,00:33:47.358,It could be any of us three.
00:33:48.109,00:33:52.113,"- Horacio, please. - I've put my family at risk."
00:33:52.196,00:33:55.742,"If there is going to be a war, I need the right tools."
00:33:57.076,00:33:58.703,All right.
00:33:58.786,00:34:00.038,Perfect.
00:34:01.622,00:34:03.708,Then tell me what you need. Hm?
00:34:05.460,00:34:07.587,Incorruptible men.
00:34:35.907,00:34:37.992,- Sure. - Come here.
00:34:42.914,00:34:48.336,"And if they didn't look inside, it meant they could be trusted to deliver anything from cocaine to..."
00:34:49.670,00:34:50.671,"well, anything else."
00:35:09.524,00:35:11.526,- How are you? - Good.
00:35:34.257,00:35:38.845,Carrillo's a cop. You can always buy a cop with money.
00:35:38.928,00:35:42.390,"- I've tried, believe me. - Then offer more."
00:35:42.974,00:35:47.937,Or I can loan you Navegante. He will do whatever I ask.
00:35:54.026,00:35:59.323,It's silver or lead. That's the choice for that bastard.
00:35:59.407,00:36:04.412,"Speaking of lead, I'm getting a shipment of weapons in."
00:36:04.495,00:36:06.330,"Uzis, grenades..."
00:36:06.414,00:36:12.336,If I could find a nuclear weapon... But now I'm negotiating a fucking missile.
00:36:12.420,00:36:15.506,- A missile? No fucking way. - Yes.
00:36:15.590,00:36:16.883,- Boss. - Eh?
00:36:20.469,00:36:25.933,"by drug enforcement agents, in a park just across the street from the White House."
00:36:26.142,00:36:31.105,And our message to the drug cartels is this: the rules have changed.
00:36:33.649,00:36:37.862,He's smoking that shit. I guarantee it.
00:36:44.827,00:36:46.829,Mm...
00:36:51.209,00:36:55.838,Mrs. Quiroga told me the neighbors on the block took a vote.
00:36:55.922,00:36:57.215,They want us to move.
00:36:57.423,00:37:01.802,But we have guards stationed outside the house 24 hours a day.
00:37:06.974,00:37:08.476,Come here.
00:37:10.394,00:37:12.939,"It won't always be like this, my love."
00:37:37.797,00:37:39.423,"- Rodrigo. - Hello, Horacio."
00:37:39.507,00:37:41.425,- Everything OK? - May I speak with you?
00:37:41.509,00:37:43.094,"Yes, sure. Come in, come in."
00:37:48.432,00:37:49.850,I'm listening.
00:37:57.191,00:38:04.824,"I've been instructed to tell you that if you cease and desist your operations, you will receive a one-time payment of six million."
00:38:06.033,00:38:08.661,"Horacio... that's US dollars, not pesos."
00:38:11.414,00:38:13.082,Instructed by whom?
00:38:15.042,00:38:16.961,I think you can guess.
00:38:19.171,00:38:20.298,Say the name.
00:38:20.464,00:38:22.133,You know who.
00:38:23.551,00:38:24.802,"Say the name, Rodrigo."
00:38:29.557,00:38:30.766,Escobar.
00:38:36.480,00:38:40.401,"Don't look at me like that, Horacio. I've always cared for you."
00:38:40.484,00:38:44.864,I'm making this suggestion to save you and your family from terrible grief.
00:38:49.452,00:38:52.288,I'm surprised he hasn't killed you already.
00:38:54.206,00:38:55.333,Get out.
00:38:57.626,00:39:08.846,"Horacio, please-- Horacio..."
00:39:29.158,00:39:31.911,"Was with my buddy, John. He was my best man."
00:39:36.082,00:39:39.126,"It was fucking blazing outside, 110 degrees."
00:39:39.210,00:39:42.380,"Whole bridal party was there sweating their balls off, I'm sure."
00:39:47.301,00:39:49.345,Please don't tell me you left her at the altar.
00:39:50.262,00:39:52.139,I don't know if she actually made it to the altar.
00:39:58.479,00:40:02.149,"Yeah, she forgave me. Eventually."
00:40:02.233,00:40:05.736,- Married a stockbroker from Dallas. - Hm.
00:40:12.159,00:40:14.370,"Trust me, she's better off."
00:40:22.711,00:40:24.255,He's gonna talk.
00:41:07.423,00:41:09.467,Gacha's going tonight to Cartagena.
00:41:14.096,00:41:15.848,I can help you get him.
00:41:15.931,00:41:18.517,You said you had information. You didn't say Gacha.
00:41:20.227,00:41:22.021,I guess is your lucky day.
00:41:29.278,00:41:31.780,- What's the informant's motivation? - Could be money.
00:41:31.947,00:41:35.326,The reward for Gacha is one million US. I'd say that's pretty good motivation.
00:41:35.409,00:41:38.245,He spends his life on the run if we don't catch him.
00:41:38.329,00:41:41.248,- Something else going on with this guy. - It's worth taking a risk.
00:41:44.418,00:41:48.672,"Peña, you go to Cartagena. Solely in an observational capacity."
00:41:48.756,00:41:52.384,"We want this man captured alive, if possible."
00:41:52.468,00:41:53.802,Murphy stays here in Bogotá.
00:41:54.011,00:42:00.184,"Gaviria's press conference is tonight, and I wanna be sure whatever he plans to say, he gets to say it."
00:42:04.021,00:42:06.315,"That's a beautiful dress, Ambassador Noonan."
00:42:26.460,00:42:29.838,"No! No more, please! No more!"
00:42:32.258,00:42:34.635,"Ah, he's all yours. He's ready to talk."
00:42:35.594,00:42:36.762,Father...
00:42:38.264,00:42:41.141,how did Elisa Alvaro get away?
00:42:58.701,00:43:03.289,I just don't understand. How'd you get involved with communists?
00:43:03.372,00:43:05.374,Have you actually met a communist?
00:43:05.457,00:43:07.835,"Yeah, I have, actually... and she lied to me."
00:43:07.918,00:43:09.753,"Well, I'm not a communist, Connie."
00:43:09.962,00:43:13.382,"I'm fighting against poverty, corruption, injustice and greed."
00:43:13.591,00:43:16.093,But I guess Americans don't have the same problem.
00:43:16.176,00:43:17.469,Don't we?
00:43:17.553,00:43:19.096,It's not the same.
00:43:19.179,00:43:21.432,"Look, I just wish you'd been straight with me."
00:43:22.891,00:43:24.143,I'm sorry.
00:43:24.852,00:43:26.186,Perhaps I should go.
00:43:27.354,00:43:31.191,"You can't just go. Look, if they find you, they'll kill you."
00:43:33.027,00:43:36.196,I fell in love with a man... with a good man.
00:43:36.280,00:43:38.866,And I was hoping to do something good.
00:43:38.949,00:43:43.871,"But instead, I fell into something... else, something more violent."
00:43:45.664,00:43:47.791,"Yeah, that makes two of us."
00:43:53.881,00:43:55.174,I'll see you when I get home.
00:44:00.888,00:44:02.931,"Here, Elisa's ID."
00:44:03.015,00:44:06.101,- What am I supposed to do with that? - Take her to Cumaral.
00:44:06.185,00:44:07.686,My contact there agreed to hide her.
00:44:11.482,00:44:14.193,"- Who made this? - Brother, what do you suggest we do?"
00:44:14.276,00:44:15.736,Jump out of a window?
00:44:18.197,00:44:19.490,"Look, she's..."
00:44:21.492,00:44:23.994,- She's important. - To who?
00:44:24.953,00:44:26.246,To us.
00:44:33.754,00:44:38.425,I take care of Elisa... you better fucking get Gacha.
00:44:49.853,00:44:51.480,It's been a long time since we've been alone.
00:44:51.563,00:44:57.069,"Mm. Just you, me... and our bodyguard."
00:44:59.988,00:45:03.700,Like the old days when we were young and your father watched us.
00:45:44.533,00:45:46.827,Hello? Yes.
00:45:51.248,00:45:52.458,Yes.
00:45:55.294,00:45:56.837,But he's all right?
00:45:59.840,00:46:01.175,All right.
00:46:17.733,00:46:19.526,Ana?
00:46:30.621,00:46:31.663,Ana?
00:46:40.964,00:46:42.174,Ana?
00:46:46.386,00:46:47.554,Ana!
00:46:55.103,00:46:56.730,I'm helping it out.
00:47:07.991,00:47:09.159,What?
00:47:14.456,00:47:16.500,There was an assassination attempt...
00:47:18.585,00:47:21.046,on Colonel Carrillo.
00:47:21.129,00:47:22.422,Did someone die?
00:47:30.472,00:47:32.683,the position you're in.
00:47:32.808,00:47:36.061,I want you to know I think you are very brave.
00:47:38.897,00:47:42.651,I'm not brave. Not like Galán.
00:47:43.860,00:47:45.946,That fear keeps you alive.
00:47:47.531,00:47:50.075,That's what none of them understand.
00:47:53.912,00:47:57.457,I will support any decision you make.
00:48:09.553,00:48:11.597,than another's fear.
00:48:14.975,00:48:20.230,Luis Carlos Galán had made a decision that cost his life.
00:48:22.232,00:48:25.152,"And now, it was Gaviria's turn."
00:48:30.365,00:48:37.456,"Tonight, I have the great pleasure of introducing candidate César Gaviria."
00:49:02.689,00:49:08.987,to deal with every man equally... in the eyes of the law.
00:49:11.073,00:49:12.366,So...
00:49:32.844,00:49:34.388,Colombians say...
00:49:36.306,00:49:38.850,God made our land so beautiful...
00:49:39.935,00:49:42.437,it was unfair to the rest of the world.
00:49:44.439,00:49:46.316,So to even the score...
00:49:47.818,00:49:53.407,God populated the land... with a race of evil men.
00:50:02.040,00:50:07.879,is the violence and terror that currently grips our beloved country.
00:50:09.297,00:50:14.052,A violence initiated by these evil men...
00:50:15.137,00:50:17.556,will be brought to justice...
00:50:20.016,00:50:22.144,in the name of decency...
00:50:24.730,00:50:27.232,and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán.
00:50:27.441,00:50:29.860,We will extradite.
00:50:30.610,00:50:35.115,This decision... will not come from fear.
00:50:36.366,00:50:40.036,It has come from a clarity of judgment...
00:50:41.037,00:50:46.460,free from the cloud of terror that surrounds us and obscures our view.
00:50:49.087,00:51:00.640,I can say only one thing to Colombians in these times of peril: There will be a future.
00:52:03.912,00:52:06.289,You should change your satellite phone.
00:52:08.166,00:52:09.584,Who is this?
00:52:09.668,00:52:13.255,Your mother's in Rionegro with that tub of lard you call your son.
00:52:14.381,00:52:17.676,"And your wife was at Carrera 11 today, shopping for clothes."
00:52:17.759,00:52:23.723,"You bastard son of a bitch, you think that-- What, you think because you're a cop I'm afraid of you or something?"
00:52:23.807,00:52:27.060,"You know where my family is, fag, well, I know where yours is, too."
00:52:27.143,00:52:29.145,- Don't forget that. - Gonorrhea bastard son of a bitch.
00:52:29.229,00:52:31.398,Why don't you take money like everyone else?
00:52:31.481,00:52:34.234,"I could have had you living like a king. But now, guess what?"
00:52:34.317,00:52:46.621,"Time to kill your dad, your mom, your kids, your entire family, and you should be smart enough to realize I have each and every one of them under watch, you fucking bastard."
00:52:46.705,00:52:49.207,"Not everyone's for sale, Pablo."
00:52:49.291,00:52:52.127,"You just keep hiding, and I will find you."
00:52:52.210,00:52:53.587,Don't know when...
00:52:53.795,00:52:55.589,but I will find you.
00:52:56.381,00:52:58.049,And when I find you...
00:52:59.050,00:53:03.346,"- I'm going to kill you. - I'm going to kill you and your entire family, you son of a bitch!"
00:53:24.743,00:53:26.828,"It's war, then."
00:00:54.429,00:00:57.849,- How are you? - Very well. How are you?
00:00:58.058,00:01:00.018,"Your ID, please."
00:01:00.977,00:01:02.437,Certainly.
00:01:28.421,00:01:31.424,How many times have I told you not to throw the ball over there?
00:01:31.508,00:01:33.426,Are you trying to scare your sister or what?
00:01:33.510,00:01:35.178,- She's crying. - Of course she's crying.
00:01:35.261,00:01:36.846,Don't you see she's just a baby?
00:01:36.930,00:01:39.015,You yourself were a baby not too long ago.
00:01:39.098,00:01:40.225,"Yes, Dad."
00:01:40.308,00:01:42.227,- What's wrong? - Nothing.
00:01:43.520,00:01:47.106,"- What's wrong, Juan Pablo? - I want her to die."
00:01:49.859,00:01:51.611,Never say that.
00:01:53.238,00:01:58.827,"We are a family and we have to look out for each other, always."
00:02:13.925,00:02:14.843,Hello.
00:02:17.428,00:02:20.390,"- Yes, go on. How many? - Two."
00:02:20.473,00:02:22.976,"Yeah, but two what? Sergeants or officers?"
00:02:23.059,00:02:25.019,Officers. You know Poison.
00:02:25.103,00:02:28.898,"- Officers are a million each. - OK, so two million?"
00:02:28.982,00:02:32.068,"- Yes, I'm writing it down here. - OK, talk to you later."
00:02:32.152,00:02:33.528,All right.
00:02:34.487,00:02:36.281,What were you talking about?
00:02:36.364,00:02:38.283,Just business.
00:02:38.366,00:02:40.994,I want to be a businessman like you.
00:04:31.187,00:04:36.109,He established a bounty system for killing cops and over 200 were slaughtered.
00:04:37.068,00:04:40.488,The police had to build a special morgue just to hold the bodies.
00:04:43.157,00:04:45.493,"The cops, they took vengeance."
00:04:54.252,00:04:57.297,"Father Sandoval, mother María. We own a large tobacco farm."
00:04:57.380,00:05:02.051,I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
00:05:02.135,00:05:03.970,"OK, try it again and look at me."
00:05:04.053,00:05:05.888,I've already done it 17 times.
00:05:06.097,00:05:07.849,You got me and my wife into this.
00:05:07.932,00:05:11.269,Now sit down and do it again until you get it right.
00:05:13.479,00:05:16.399,"My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán."
00:05:16.482,00:05:19.110,"Father Sandoval, mother María. We own a large tobacco farm."
00:05:19.193,00:05:24.782,I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
00:05:24.866,00:05:27.660,What if they ask me a question about chemistry?
00:05:28.619,00:05:32.957,- I hope you're good at bullshitting. - OK-- Sit down. Do it again. It's getting better.
00:05:36.002,00:05:39.505,because she could tie Escobar to the Palace of Justice...
00:05:39.589,00:05:44.052,"but by protecting a communist, we were traitors."
00:05:44.135,00:05:45.470,Go figure.
00:06:49.325,00:06:50.618,Let's go.
00:06:56.916,00:06:58.835,"Honey, thank you."
00:06:59.919,00:07:02.588,"- You better help us get Escobar. - I want him dead, too."
00:07:02.672,00:07:04.132,"Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?"
00:07:04.215,00:07:06.717,You clearly don't know your country's history in Latin America.
00:07:06.801,00:07:10.304,"- Sorry, I didn't hear that-- - Honey, mellow out, OK?"
00:07:26.446,00:07:29.031,"Steve, I know you're mad, but this is the right thing to do."
00:07:29.115,00:07:31.701,"The right thing to do? I didn't have a choice in the matter, did I?"
00:07:36.539,00:07:39.417,They're in their car. Hold on.
00:07:39.625,00:07:42.336,Wow. Maybe I will.
00:07:42.545,00:07:44.297,"Just get in the car, OK?"
00:07:49.719,00:07:51.179,"OK, OK, they're on the move."
00:08:00.563,00:08:05.359,Should've never brought Connie down here. She's not cut out for it.
00:08:09.280,00:08:12.325,Just keep your head down and this'll all be over soon enough.
00:08:12.408,00:08:14.619,We're gonna cut him off up here on the left.
00:08:23.169,00:08:24.670,"Get out of the car, Murphy!"
00:08:25.338,00:08:26.380,Get out!
00:08:27.673,00:08:29.926,- Step away from the vehicle. - You following me?
00:08:32.512,00:08:33.429,- Easy. - Back!
00:08:33.513,00:08:38.142,"- Come on. Move the fuck back! - Get your hands-- - You spying on me? - Relax, Murphy!"
00:08:38.226,00:08:40.144,Who the fuck were you talking to?
00:08:42.813,00:08:44.232,The fuck is she?
00:08:53.449,00:08:54.825,Stand down.
00:08:56.911,00:08:59.789,"Who were you talking to, huh?"
00:08:59.872,00:09:00.873,Peña.
00:09:01.999,00:09:03.626,I got wife troubles.
00:09:04.669,00:09:06.879,- Wife troubles. - Yeah.
00:09:11.217,00:09:12.843,I hope he's OK.
00:09:15.888,00:09:17.265,Shit.
00:09:44.166,00:09:45.376,Yes.
00:09:46.627,00:09:48.963,I asked where you are headed.
00:09:49.046,00:09:51.340,- Popayán. - Popayán?
00:09:51.424,00:09:53.009,"Your papers, please."
00:10:42.933,00:10:44.101,Alba Borraga.
00:10:45.478,00:10:46.854,Have a nice trip.
00:10:48.022,00:10:49.482,- Thank you. - Be well.
00:10:49.565,00:10:50.941,"Gracias, señor."
00:11:00.534,00:11:02.119,Hello?
00:11:04.622,00:11:06.832,"OK, yes."
00:11:06.916,00:11:09.335,"OK, you got her to the orphanage. Good."
00:11:09.418,00:11:10.836,Elisa's fine.
00:11:12.129,00:11:14.632,"Oh, God. No, I'm just glad you're OK."
00:11:14.715,00:11:17.385,"Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?"
00:11:17.468,00:11:19.261,I want you to call me every other hour from the road.
00:11:19.345,00:11:20.971,"Actually, call me every hour."
00:11:22.390,00:11:25.309,"Yeah. Yeah, I know."
00:11:25.393,00:11:27.269,"I love you, too."
00:11:27.353,00:11:29.688,I'm proud of you. Bye.
00:12:03.222,00:12:04.557,Mm-hm.
00:12:07.810,00:12:12.481,"to the United States, and it was in our best interest that he win the presidency."
00:12:12.565,00:12:13.858,- But to win... - Gracias.
00:12:13.941,00:12:16.026,...he had to survive until election day.
00:12:16.110,00:12:17.695,"Uh, Señor Gaviria?"
00:12:28.497,00:12:29.582,- Nice to meet you. - Pleasure.
00:12:29.665,00:12:33.169,"I'm Eduardo Sandoval, head of security of Dr. Gaviria."
00:12:33.252,00:12:34.295,What can we do for you?
00:12:34.378,00:12:40.301,I'm hoping that our agency can offer some resources to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.
00:12:40.384,00:12:44.763,Shouldn't the DEA be out chasing traffickers or is just my thought?
00:12:44.847,00:12:47.641,- I think the two coincide. - Agent Murphy.
00:12:48.350,00:12:49.977,"- Pleasure, sir. - The pleasure is mine."
00:12:50.060,00:12:51.937,"Please, have a seat."
00:12:56.692,00:13:01.614,Your Secret Service has briefed us on security measures.
00:13:01.697,00:13:05.868,"No open-air speaking engagements, different routes home every day."
00:13:05.951,00:13:10.122,"As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán, we needed an education on these things."
00:13:10.206,00:13:11.457,- Come on. - Exactly.
00:13:11.540,00:13:13.083,These men will stop at nothing to kill you.
00:13:13.292,00:13:17.546,I'm aware of that. And we're taking every precaution.
00:13:17.755,00:13:23.719,"Your government even offers the use of an armored Cadillac limousine, built for your president."
00:13:23.802,00:13:30.142,The thing is that driving around in Bogotá with an American-made tank won't exactly endear us to the voters.
00:13:30.851,00:13:36.106,And to be honest... we don't know how to respond to that one.
00:13:36.315,00:13:39.693,"Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy, I'd say thank you."
00:13:41.779,00:13:43.781,"Well, thank you."
00:13:43.864,00:13:44.865,And this?
00:13:47.451,00:13:49.620,What are we supposed to do with this?
00:13:51.455,00:13:53.082,Bullet-proof pants.
00:13:54.333,00:13:56.335,I suggest that you wear them.
00:13:58.462,00:14:01.674,"Thank you, Agent Murphy, for your consideration."
00:14:01.757,00:14:04.176,And we'll keep in mind your advice.
00:14:06.470,00:14:07.721,Thank you for your time.
00:14:11.892,00:14:19.316,WITH GAVIRIA THERE WILL BE A FUTURE for his stance on extradition. This made him a target.
00:14:39.253,00:14:42.840,Some guy was trying to sell me a computer. I don't know what it is.
00:14:49.263,00:14:51.557,"- It's coming out now? - Yeah, Dad."
00:14:53.809,00:14:55.895,"Hey, honey."
00:14:58.022,00:15:01.066,You look very beautiful today.
00:15:09.450,00:15:12.786,- Do you need anything else? - I want you.
00:15:19.376,00:15:21.337,I want to fuck her.
00:15:21.545,00:15:25.466,"We have more important things to worry about right now, my son."
00:15:25.674,00:15:27.217,Understood?
00:15:28.385,00:15:30.846,Talk to me. What do you know?
00:15:30.930,00:15:33.807,"Don Gonzalo, we have people all over the property."
00:15:33.891,00:15:35.225,It's secure.
00:15:39.104,00:15:43.275,"Now, what can you tell me about Medellín?"
00:15:44.735,00:15:46.612,"The same, boss."
00:15:46.695,00:15:50.783,Carrillo's entire Search Bloc is out looking for Pablo.
00:15:52.451,00:15:55.371,"- Here to serve, boss. - Keep us safe."
00:15:57.915,00:15:59.166,Don Freddy.
00:16:02.294,00:16:05.172,Son... a question.
00:16:06.507,00:16:09.510,Are we sheep or are we wolves?
00:16:09.718,00:16:13.973,- We're wolves. - We're wolves! Right.
00:16:14.056,00:16:15.557,I like it.
00:16:22.022,00:16:25.818,Just know there are a lot of people guarding him.
00:16:26.026,00:16:31.031,"Navegante, you've been working for Gacha for many years."
00:16:31.115,00:16:35.035,I'm sure in that time you've earned way more than we are giving you.
00:16:35.953,00:16:38.497,"So tell me, why do you want to betray him?"
00:16:42.126,00:16:44.128,That fucker's crazy.
00:16:45.671,00:16:47.756,He's gonna get us all killed.
00:16:57.975,00:17:00.310,I don't believe him one bit.
00:17:00.394,00:17:03.105,What do you care why he's doing it?
00:17:03.188,00:17:08.318,Because we have 23 agents with outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.
00:17:08.402,00:17:12.573,And he has twice as many men with brand new weapons.
00:17:12.656,00:17:14.366,And frankly...
00:17:14.450,00:17:18.871,I'm tired of sending young men to face certain death.
00:17:18.954,00:17:21.081,So then we have to be smart.
00:17:23.250,00:17:25.252,We have to create a trap.
00:17:25.335,00:17:27.921,"If we catch him alive, he'll give us Escobar."
00:17:28.005,00:17:29.506,And the Ochoas.
00:17:29.590,00:17:33.343,"- The entire cartel. - I don't give a fuck, Javier."
00:17:33.427,00:17:34.762,I want him dead.
00:17:34.845,00:17:36.972,He doesn't care about death.
00:17:37.056,00:17:40.142,He only fears rotting in jail.
00:17:41.560,00:17:45.439,"- That's the real victory. - Right, I forgot you're a gringo."
00:17:46.523,00:17:50.360,- What's that supposed to mean? - What are you risking?
00:17:50.444,00:17:52.237,These aren't your men.
00:17:52.321,00:17:54.656,You have no family here to lose.
00:17:54.740,00:18:00.496,"If this goes badly, there will be more widows and orphans, and I'll have to carry that on my shoulders."
00:18:05.667,00:18:08.253,I trust his information.
00:18:11.340,00:18:13.300,And I trust you.
00:18:14.134,00:18:19.098,But if this turns out bad... it'll be on your conscience.
00:18:28.524,00:18:32.361,Routine airport surveillance. We tagged Poison.
00:18:42.871,00:18:44.998,Who's this guy?
00:18:45.082,00:18:49.169,"I don't know, but if Poison showed his face to pick him up, he must be really important."
00:18:56.135,00:18:59.763,It'll be taken to the coast of Spain on a cargo ship.
00:18:59.847,00:19:03.308,"From there, our trucks will take it to the Basque country."
00:19:04.768,00:19:06.311,It's all set up.
00:19:09.064,00:19:12.401,"5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain on the first flight."
00:19:20.450,00:19:22.578,"As far as I know, you and my cousin have an agreement."
00:19:22.786,00:19:24.997,The agreement is for this amount.
00:19:25.080,00:19:26.707,What kind of bullshit is this?
00:19:28.000,00:19:30.335,"5,000 kilos or no deal."
00:19:32.129,00:19:35.716,Then there is no deal. Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
00:19:40.596,00:19:42.848,"Forgive my cousin, sir."
00:19:48.270,00:19:50.856,"5,000 it is, then."
00:20:02.075,00:20:04.286,I want you in the US.
00:20:04.369,00:20:07.289,"You'll be safe there, far from all of this."
00:20:07.372,00:20:10.292,- What if something happens-- - Nothing is going to happen to me.
00:20:11.460,00:20:12.920,Let's go.
00:20:25.432,00:20:27.517,"Please, protect him."
00:20:28.393,00:20:31.563,"Don't worry, everything will be fine. Come on, I'll walk you."
00:20:57.256,00:21:01.969,"my wife was with Colombia's most wanted fugitive, and my partner was in Cartagena."
00:21:02.928,00:21:09.184,"He had his own mission, with a group of cops who had seen their friends and relatives die at the hands of Gacha."
00:21:10.644,00:21:17.401,"Like Trujillo, whose father and two brothers, all cops, had died in gun battles with the cartel."
00:21:21.071,00:21:26.118,"As hard as we were going after Gacha, the narcos wanted Gaviria."
00:21:31.832,00:21:34.668,It killed me to ask for help from this guy.
00:21:34.751,00:21:38.547,"Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish, with none of the charm."
00:21:41.758,00:21:43.468,The Golden Gringo.
00:21:49.182,00:21:50.851,I only speak to Peña.
00:22:00.444,00:22:03.822,I need to know who he is.
00:22:09.286,00:22:11.330,"Don't make me laugh, faggot."
00:22:12.247,00:22:14.583,I need to know who he is.
00:22:37.981,00:22:41.818,"- Jesus Christ. - Next time you wanna fuck somebody, take 'em on a date."
00:22:41.902,00:22:43.320,What's going on?
00:22:47.657,00:22:48.867,We have no intel to that effect.
00:22:48.950,00:22:52.746,Maybe you should do your job instead of spying on other agency personnel.
00:22:53.622,00:22:57.209,"- What's he talking about? - Nothing, Ambassador."
00:22:57.292,00:23:02.881,"CIA's been so kind to give us these documents, but 90 percent of them are too classified for us to read."
00:23:03.090,00:23:05.258,I need to get into the White Room.
00:23:05.467,00:23:06.843,What's that?
00:23:07.052,00:23:08.762,Cut the shit. You're gonna give me these files.
00:23:13.725,00:23:16.603,Spy novels... Have you read The Spaniard?
00:23:19.606,00:23:21.441,"Ma'am, he has been in the country for several days."
00:23:21.525,00:23:24.361,He's been escorted by one of Pablo's top sicarios.
00:23:24.444,00:23:25.445,Let me see this.
00:23:31.535,00:23:34.746,"Now, are you going to give me access or not?"
00:23:39.042,00:23:41.211,"Technically, the room isn't white."
00:23:41.419,00:23:43.922,It's more of a... burgundy.
00:23:50.345,00:23:53.431,"- Agent Schroeder, will you join us? - Mm-hm."
00:23:58.270,00:24:01.606,"for the CIA's deepest, darkest secrets."
00:24:01.690,00:24:05.861,"So secret, in fact, that its very existence was never acknowledged."
00:24:12.659,00:24:13.827,Sit here.
00:24:15.328,00:24:17.789,Agent Schroeder will watch you the entire time.
00:24:18.915,00:24:20.500,Where are the files?
00:24:38.810,00:24:39.978,"I don't know, Pablo."
00:24:40.061,00:24:42.731,I feel like we need to suspend the operation.
00:24:42.814,00:24:46.359,"- It's too delicate. - You worry too much, Gustavo."
00:24:56.703,00:24:58.455,Keep laughing.
00:25:01.208,00:25:03.084,"How's our boy doing, Mom?"
00:25:03.168,00:25:06.379,"He's learning, with a little tough love."
00:25:06.463,00:25:08.423,"- What's up, Aunt? - What's new?"
00:25:09.424,00:25:13.803,"That's so he can mix with the sons of the oligarchs, right?"
00:25:13.887,00:25:16.473,"- Yes, sir. - So he can get us some information."
00:25:17.766,00:25:19.392,What about these clowns?
00:25:20.810,00:25:22.437,Are they treating you right?
00:25:23.396,00:25:25.190,More or less.
00:25:26.233,00:25:29.611,What do you mean more or less? We treat you good.
00:25:30.987,00:25:32.781,"Are we going to eat, Gustavo?"
00:25:43.416,00:25:44.793,Thank you.
00:25:46.211,00:25:47.295,Jaime.
00:25:49.422,00:25:51.591,Welcome to the family.
00:25:53.301,00:25:55.262,"Thank you,boss."
00:25:59.140,00:26:00.892,Can't you do anything?
00:26:05.188,00:26:07.399,"While we're at war, we can't do anything."
00:26:08.191,00:26:14.155,This is bullshit. People are turning up dead every day and my friends think my brothers are responsible.
00:26:16.283,00:26:18.702,"Let's talk about something else, baby."
00:26:19.869,00:26:20.954,Yes.
00:26:21.871,00:26:24.874,"All right, let's talk about running away together."
00:26:24.958,00:26:27.002,Let's get away while we can.
00:26:29.462,00:26:32.757,Let's get away. Listen to this.
00:26:38.847,00:26:41.599,Why would you run away with a criminal like me?
00:26:43.268,00:26:44.811,And why not?
00:26:47.564,00:26:49.441,I wish it was that easy.
00:26:49.524,00:26:52.277,- Ah. - I can't just leave like that.
00:26:52.360,00:26:54.279,I know.
00:26:56.906,00:26:59.367,I don't give a shit about my wife.
00:27:04.539,00:27:06.791,Who is the woman in that relationship?
00:27:06.875,00:27:08.293,You?
00:27:20.972,00:27:24.225,"And now, he began to wonder about Navegante."
00:27:38.740,00:27:40.241,What are you doing?
00:27:42.035,00:27:43.328,"I'm married, sir."
00:27:43.411,00:27:45.455,That's no problem. I can make you a widow pretty quick.
00:27:45.538,00:27:47.957,Don't touch me! Don't touch me.
00:27:48.041,00:27:50.543,"Freddy, leave her alone. Come here."
00:27:50.627,00:27:51.669,What's up?
00:27:51.878,00:27:55.298,"The Search Bloc is here, not in Medellín."
00:27:55.382,00:27:57.133,But Navegante said they were over there.
00:27:57.217,00:28:01.012,Navegante... Navegante is a liar.
00:28:01.221,00:28:02.639,He wouldn't betray you.
00:28:02.847,00:28:07.227,"Freddy... think, think."
00:28:07.310,00:28:10.271,Everyone in the world has a price.
00:28:14.192,00:28:16.778,"They want war, we'll give them war!"
00:28:33.670,00:28:35.713,He was a member of ETA.
00:28:35.922,00:28:37.799,Never heard of 'em?
00:28:38.007,00:28:40.719,They made bomb-making a goddamn art form.
00:28:44.222,00:28:50.228,"They were a group of supposed freedom fighters from the Basque country, trying to secede from Spain."
00:28:51.604,00:28:55.233,Their specialty was targeted assassinations of public figures.
00:28:57.944,00:29:05.118,"ETA was responsible for the assassination of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco, returning home from Christmas Mass..."
00:29:06.953,00:29:12.208,and a remote-controlled car bomb that killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.
00:29:14.753,00:29:18.298,The man behind those bombs? You guessed it... the Spaniard.
00:29:19.174,00:29:24.304,"Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez, a celebrity now, for hire."
00:29:24.387,00:29:26.473,"Expensive, but the best."
00:29:27.390,00:29:29.976,'Cause Pablo only hires the best.
00:29:38.735,00:29:42.238,"That was Pablo's plan, to blow up Gaviria."
00:29:42.322,00:29:46.534,"The question was, where, when and how?"
00:29:50.830,00:29:54.751,but canceling our campaign travel is not an option.
00:29:54.959,00:30:00.590,"Well, given the new information that Agent Murphy has uncovered, I hope you'll reconsider."
00:30:01.466,00:30:04.886,"He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá, and a dozen other cities."
00:30:04.969,00:30:06.805,You are a target in every one.
00:30:07.013,00:30:14.521,"Yes, and... we've done everything your Secret Service and Spain's Civil Guard have recommended."
00:30:14.604,00:30:18.733,"We also have bomb-sniffing dogs at every campaign stop, so..."
00:30:18.817,00:30:19.776,I think we're good.
00:30:19.984,00:30:22.237,You think the Spaniard doesn't know that?
00:30:23.905,00:30:25.698,"Yes, I know."
00:30:25.782,00:30:31.746,"But tell me, Agent Murphy, how do you expect him to win the election if he hides like a scared rabbit behind all this violence?"
00:30:31.830,00:30:33.414,"Tell me, how?"
00:30:33.498,00:30:36.000,How do you expect him to win if he's dead?
00:30:36.209,00:30:38.753,I'm not telling your wife you died on my watch.
00:30:38.962,00:30:41.089,"This is not your watch, OK?"
00:30:43.758,00:30:47.887,"Thank you, Agent Murphy... but Eduardo's right."
00:30:49.305,00:30:51.140,I'll take my chances.
00:30:59.482,00:31:01.818,I hope you'll pay for this information.
00:31:12.453,00:31:15.623,Suárez is talking to the DEA.
00:31:17.917,00:31:20.336,You know what you have to do.
00:31:56.706,00:31:58.791,They killed the goddamn maid.
00:32:06.966,00:32:07.926,Colonel...
00:32:10.136,00:32:11.804,They called from the road block.
00:32:11.888,00:32:15.516,They have a car stopped and they're saying the driver's a senator.
00:32:18.186,00:32:19.687,So what's the problem?
00:32:24.025,00:32:25.401,Let's go.
00:32:36.371,00:32:38.206,Look at my credentials.
00:32:38.289,00:32:41.209,"No, I don't know this Gacha person you're referring to."
00:32:42.502,00:32:45.004,Why do you have a gun in the trunk?
00:32:47.048,00:32:52.929,"Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician in this country carries a weapon?"
00:32:53.012,00:32:54.722,Please.
00:32:54.806,00:32:57.725,- It's my bodyguard's. - Where's your bodyguard?
00:32:58.768,00:33:00.937,"You're alone in the car, right?"
00:33:02.605,00:33:04.607,"Listen to me, officers..."
00:33:04.691,00:33:09.320,"if you don't let me go immediately, you're going to regret it."
00:33:10.113,00:33:11.322,Uh-huh.
00:33:13.783,00:33:15.076,Thank you.
00:33:15.785,00:33:18.413,- Give us a moment. - Go on.
00:33:23.292,00:33:24.961,I don't either.
00:33:27.130,00:33:29.507,He could have bought his credentials.
00:33:30.466,00:33:33.094,What if it turns out he is a senator?
00:33:33.177,00:33:34.929,We'll pay for that.
00:33:36.889,00:33:39.475,I can't run that risk.
00:33:39.559,00:33:41.394,It's true.
00:33:46.899,00:33:50.653,The next one... goes in your head!
00:33:52.572,00:33:54.657,"I'll talk, I'll talk!"
00:34:00.246,00:34:03.249,You have a guest. It's Don Pablo.
00:34:04.459,00:34:06.794,"Hey, Jaime."
00:34:06.878,00:34:08.463,- Don Pablo. - This is your house?
00:34:08.546,00:34:11.549,"- Your family? - Yes, sir. Welcome."
00:34:11.632,00:34:12.925,Tell me about them.
00:34:13.009,00:34:15.636,This is my daughter Marcela.
00:34:18.097,00:34:20.808,- How proud you must be. - Of course I am.
00:34:20.892,00:34:22.810,Of course.
00:34:22.894,00:34:27.273,"Very soon, they will have the money to buy everything they want, Jaime."
00:34:27.356,00:34:28.900,"Thanks a lot, boss."
00:34:28.983,00:34:30.902,- May I please have a glass of water? - Of course.
00:34:30.985,00:34:32.487,Thank you.
00:34:32.570,00:34:33.738,"- What about you? - Good, sir."
00:34:33.821,00:34:36.824,"- How have you been? - Good, thank you."
00:34:37.742,00:34:38.826,Guys.
00:34:39.660,00:34:42.163,"All right, Jaime."
00:34:43.498,00:34:46.584,This is for you to wear during your mission.
00:34:46.667,00:34:48.252,"Thank you, Ma'am. Very kind."
00:34:48.336,00:34:50.296,"Seriously, Pablo?"
00:34:50.379,00:34:52.090,Thank you very much.
00:34:52.173,00:34:54.258,Everything is so beautiful.
00:34:54.342,00:34:59.055,"You have to be very careful, and get by unnoticed."
00:34:59.138,00:35:02.350,"For sure, sir. I'm ready to do what you're asking."
00:35:02.558,00:35:04.560,"All right, then, son."
00:35:04.644,00:35:06.104,Sit down.
00:35:08.147,00:35:12.401,These guys are going to give you very specific instructions.
00:35:12.485,00:35:15.530,"Tomorrow morning, you're boarding the plane that is leaving for Cali."
00:35:15.738,00:35:18.741,We want you to record a conversation.
00:35:18.825,00:35:21.577,"It's very simple, nothing to worry about."
00:35:22.703,00:35:24.539,All right.
00:35:27.250,00:35:31.838,- How are you feeling? - I'm... I'm very happy.
00:35:31.921,00:35:35.758,"Thank you very much for the opportunity, Don Pablo. Seriously. And for the clothes."
00:35:35.842,00:35:38.594,"Really, for me, it's an honor to work for you."
00:35:38.678,00:35:40.346,Thank you very much.
00:35:44.892,00:35:46.352,OK.
00:35:46.435,00:35:48.980,"Come here, give me a hug."
00:35:50.565,00:35:52.441,"Thank you, Don Pablo."
00:35:53.818,00:35:55.361,Thank you.
00:35:58.614,00:36:00.241,Thank you very much.
00:36:00.324,00:36:01.993,"See you later, boys."
00:36:02.076,00:36:04.287,"- Take care. - Yes, sir."
00:36:04.370,00:36:06.831,"My love, look!"
00:36:06.914,00:36:11.294,"- Look at this jacket. Beautiful, right? - It's beautiful. What did Pablo say?"
00:36:11.377,00:36:14.881,You know what? We're going to get ahead.
00:36:16.257,00:36:19.969,"You, me and the baby are going to get ahead."
00:36:20.052,00:36:21.387,"Thank you, my love."
00:36:21.470,00:36:24.140,- Look at this. - Let's go try it on.
00:36:30.313,00:36:33.065,They're going to kill him on the way to Cali.
00:36:37.445,00:36:39.071,"Suárez, OK."
00:36:39.155,00:36:40.448,I can translate.
00:36:48.039,00:36:49.916,- Door. - Door.
00:36:49.999,00:36:52.710,Suárez! Suárez.
00:37:08.184,00:37:10.561,"Talk to me, you bastard. Suárez, hello?"
00:37:11.270,00:37:13.105,Hello?
00:37:28.746,00:37:31.332,And Peña still hoped he could be taken alive.
00:37:49.976,00:37:53.396,"Are you still thinking about that? Let it go, son."
00:37:53.479,00:37:57.441,All she had to do was say yes and I wouldn't have had to shoot her!
00:37:57.525,00:37:58.818,Be a man!
00:39:36.165,00:39:39.043,"- Sir, are you OK? - I'm fine. I'm fine."
00:39:41.462,00:39:43.214,"Get me a radio, quick!"
00:39:43.297,00:39:45.424,"Correal, bring a radio! Correal! A radio!"
00:39:46.592,00:39:49.970,"Dad, let's go! Hurry, Dad, hurry!"
00:39:52.306,00:39:54.016,Hurry!
00:40:19.667,00:40:22.920,Peña! Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!
00:40:28.884,00:40:31.595,What did I tell you? We got out OK.
00:40:31.679,00:40:34.306,- I'm scared. - Scared of what?
00:40:34.390,00:40:36.225,"You're a wolf, right?"
00:40:36.308,00:40:38.394,"Yes, I am a wolf."
00:40:50.239,00:40:52.491,Nobody is going to kill us! Don't talk like that!
00:40:52.575,00:40:54.493,Take this. Take it!
00:40:58.747,00:41:01.417,- I have a Chevy in sight. - Stop him!
00:41:01.625,00:41:04.795,Don't let him get away! Try and disable the vehicle!
00:41:26.692,00:41:29.528,Stop him! Do whatever you have to do!
00:41:32.948,00:41:37.119,"- Don't leave me alone, Dad. - No, no. Never, son, never!"
00:41:37.203,00:41:39.997,Breathe! Breathe!
00:41:40.080,00:41:42.124,"Do you want this, asshole?"
00:41:45.127,00:41:47.713,We'll circle around and approach from another direction.
00:41:47.922,00:41:52.051,"You don't need to worry about anything, my son. Nothing."
00:41:55.804,00:41:56.972,Copy.
00:41:59.099,00:42:02.019,Look. Look outside. Look outside!
00:42:22.498,00:42:24.250,Freddy. Freddy?
00:42:24.333,00:42:26.168,"Let's go, Freddy."
00:42:26.877,00:42:28.087,Freddy?
00:42:28.879,00:42:30.297,Freddy?
00:42:30.381,00:42:32.174,Son!
00:42:44.019,00:42:45.479,Asshole!
00:42:45.563,00:42:48.524,"Asshole! Hey, asshole!"
00:42:48.691,00:42:50.484,"Freddy! Wake up, Freddy!"
00:42:54.488,00:42:57.283,What are you gonna do? Asshole!
00:42:57.491,00:43:00.703,What are you gonna do?! Asshole!
00:43:13.424,00:43:16.010,What are you gonna do?! Asshole!
00:43:19.555,00:43:21.015,Give him lead.
00:43:41.285,00:43:45.831,Affirmative. Maintain positions and patrol the area again. Very good.
00:43:59.261,00:44:00.638,Are you OK?
00:44:13.484,00:44:19.073,It signaled to the country and to the world that the fight against the narcos had moved to a new level.
00:44:23.494,00:44:26.288,We're gaining points in six districts within Cali.
00:44:27.081,00:44:30.542,"That's important, because it means we could pull ahead."
00:44:30.626,00:44:33.629,- Don't put too much faith in the polls. - I know.
00:44:33.712,00:44:36.632,"The last time, we fell five points in one day."
00:44:38.759,00:44:40.260,"Stop him! Sir, we can't let you through!"
00:44:52.106,00:44:56.735,"There's gonna be a bomb waiting. He goes, he dies."
00:44:56.819,00:44:58.779,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about?"
00:44:58.987,00:45:03.742,"This is your job, your call. But I know something's gonna go down."
00:45:03.826,00:45:05.411,Do you have proof?
00:45:09.248,00:45:10.916,You got your gut.
00:45:13.710,00:45:17.089,- What if you're wrong? - I hope to God I am.
00:45:17.297,00:45:19.258,What if I'm right?
00:45:33.355,00:45:35.482,You know what you have to do?
00:45:35.566,00:45:37.359,"Yes, sir."
00:45:40.863,00:45:44.658,"Remember, you have to record the entire conversation. Don't forget."
00:45:44.867,00:45:48.328,"- No, sir. - Have a nice flight."
00:45:48.412,00:45:50.330,Aren't you coming with me?
00:45:50.414,00:45:55.544,"No, the boss just told me to bring you here."
00:45:55.627,00:45:57.754,"Hey, but don't worry."
00:45:57.838,00:46:00.466,"Tomorrow, I'll come and meet you there."
00:46:00.549,00:46:04.678,"- All right, then. - All right. Don't be nervous."
00:46:04.761,00:46:06.597,You'll see how fun it is to fly.
00:46:07.681,00:46:09.141,All right?
00:46:09.975,00:46:12.686,Go on. The line is right there.
00:46:12.769,00:46:14.646,"Good luck, then."
00:46:25.199,00:46:27.868,"Whatever you decide, I'll do."
00:46:33.040,00:46:35.501,now boarding at Gate 6.
00:00:22.897,00:00:24.232,in Colombian history.
00:00:24.607,00:00:27.569,It may have been a bomb that blew up a plane in Colombia today.
00:00:27.652,00:00:29.779,The Boeing 727 of Avianca Airlines...
00:00:37.162,00:00:43.501,"to assassinate presidential candidate César Gaviria, Pablo Escobar murdered 107 innocent people."
00:00:44.878,00:00:48.256,The Paisa Robin Hood... had become a terrorist.
00:00:52.844,00:00:56.514,say the drug bosses in Colombia have to be considered prime suspects.
00:01:06.816,00:01:09.861,"No, sir. I don't know where he is."
00:01:10.987,00:01:12.614,He left home and hasn't returned.
00:01:18.495,00:01:22.499,"Natalie, your boyfriend, Jaime, was he with Pablo's sicarios?"
00:01:23.583,00:01:25.251,- No. - Are you sure?
00:01:26.002,00:01:27.086,"Yes, sir."
00:01:27.170,00:01:30.548,"Well, then, why do you have this picture of Pablo in your house?"
00:01:31.633,00:01:35.428,Nothing wrong with that. Everyone in the comuna has one.
00:01:36.638,00:01:38.723,You think those thugs are going to protect you?
00:01:38.932,00:01:43.353,You don't understand... that you represent a big problem for them.
00:01:43.561,00:01:46.064,We can help you.
00:01:46.272,00:01:50.401,We can protect you. But you have to tell us the truth.
00:02:05.333,00:02:09.379,"- Well, maybe he knew. - I don't care if he knew or not."
00:02:09.462,00:02:11.464,It's time we put a bullet in Escobar.
00:02:18.805,00:02:21.516,"But I must, for all our safety."
00:02:21.599,00:02:23.476,Did you do something wrong?
00:02:24.727,00:02:29.399,Your dad did nothing wrong.
00:02:42.537,00:02:45.123,I want you to be strong.
00:02:45.206,00:02:48.793,You have to be strong and never show weakness.
00:02:48.877,00:02:50.753,I promise I'll never be weak.
00:02:52.922,00:02:55.341,And watch out for your sister.
00:03:02.724,00:03:04.058,I love you very much.
00:03:06.853,00:03:08.438,I love you all very much.
00:03:15.278,00:03:20.408,- Watch her. - Just a few sweets and some pork rinds.
00:03:48.019,00:03:49.604,Take care.
00:03:53.399,00:03:56.319,Come on. I'm going to take you with me.
00:03:56.402,00:04:00.031,I'm going to take you with me... I'm going to take you with me.
00:04:22.428,00:04:25.014,You think he did it?
00:04:29.477,00:04:31.562,Blow up that plane?
00:04:33.898,00:04:36.567,"Of course he did it, Hermilda."
00:04:36.651,00:04:38.611,But he had his reasons.
00:04:42.156,00:04:46.744,We've got everyone looking for Jaime's wife throughout the comunas.
00:04:48.329,00:04:51.082,I want you to find her and kill her.
00:04:52.083,00:04:55.795,And kill any motherfucker that can connect me with that fucking plane.
00:04:56.879,00:04:58.423,"Yes, sir."
00:06:51.119,00:06:54.956,He became the 28th President of Colombia by a landslide.
00:07:03.089,00:07:04.882,"Not César... I mean, Mr. President."
00:07:07.885,00:07:09.053,Excuse us.
00:07:12.932,00:07:15.726,- As a former president to a new one... - Mm-hm?
00:07:15.810,00:07:17.979,...what advice would you give?
00:07:18.062,00:07:23.734,Well... you'll be asked to make many difficult decisions.
00:07:23.818,00:07:27.029,I would say one thing... do what your wife says.
00:07:32.160,00:07:39.041,"Trust your instincts, and be confident in your decisions."
00:07:39.125,00:07:40.501,Yes...
00:07:41.544,00:07:44.338,but that's easier said than done.
00:07:44.422,00:07:49.260,"You'll never be able to please everyone, so find the solution that rings true in your heart."
00:07:49.343,00:07:50.511,Thank you.
00:07:50.595,00:07:55.308,"Another thing I did want to tell you, about the Americans-- What about the Americans?"
00:07:56.392,00:08:00.271,"This will have to be off the record, my dear."
00:08:00.354,00:08:04.233,I can't have my opinions broadcast on your television show.
00:08:04.317,00:08:06.319,"No, no, no. You have my word."
00:08:07.403,00:08:09.864,- The Americans... - Yes?
00:08:10.865,00:08:12.283,Be careful.
00:08:16.704,00:08:21.167,Bringing Escobar to justice is my number one priority.
00:08:21.250,00:08:25.505,But we will do so on our own terms and own resources.
00:08:27.340,00:08:33.179,"I have enormous gratitude to you, especially with Agent Murphy, whose warnings kept me off that plane."
00:08:33.387,00:08:36.349,"You, sir, yes. Unfortunately, not the rest of the passengers."
00:08:36.557,00:08:40.686,The people in Colombia are horrified about the bombing of Avianca's plane.
00:08:40.770,00:08:50.988,"But they're also against American soldiers on our soil and spy planes intercepting calls, so-- America doesn't intercept civilian phone calls. That's absurd."
00:08:51.072,00:08:54.575,"Presidente, you need additional resources to get this man."
00:08:56.118,00:08:57.119,Well...
00:08:58.120,00:09:00.831,your government's research says...
00:09:00.915,00:09:07.338,660 tons of cocaine were consumed in the United States last year.
00:09:10.007,00:09:15.096,"Perhaps if your resources were focused at home, we'd all be better off."
00:09:23.521,00:09:27.483,Colonel Carrillo's Search Bloc was set loose with a vengeance.
00:09:28.734,00:09:31.237,Carrillo mounted dozens of raids.
00:09:33.072,00:09:37.535,"But with an army of informants, Escobar somehow always got away."
00:09:39.161,00:09:42.707,"We sat on the sidelines, hands tied by bureaucracy."
00:09:45.167,00:09:53.092,"In response, Pablo took his narco-terrorism to a whole new level with a bombing campaign that would shake the country to its foundations."
00:09:54.594,00:09:58.931,"In doing his best to avoid war, that's exactly what Gaviria got."
00:09:59.140,00:10:02.476,And the toll on both sides was devastating.
00:10:03.853,00:10:07.356,The thing about war is... it's just bad for business.
00:10:08.691,00:10:12.903,And when you got a bull's-eye on your back... your rivals get bold.
00:10:19.410,00:10:22.371,Pablo and the Medellín cartel weren't the only game in town.
00:10:22.455,00:10:24.165,Thank you.
00:10:25.041,00:10:29.170,"This is Helmer Pacho Herrera, one of the four leaders of the Cali cartel."
00:10:30.546,00:10:37.511,"While Pablo left a trail of bodies and chaos in his wake, Cali made problems disappear with an army of lawyers and a mountain of legal briefs."
00:10:38.846,00:10:45.102,"The Medellín cartel was Miami: swimming pools, bikini girls... tacky as a two-tone Cadillac."
00:10:48.189,00:10:51.067,"elegant, smooth, subtle."
00:10:51.150,00:10:58.741,"Where they could fuel the 24-hour nightlife with cocaine, and still make sure everybody showed up for work on Wall Street the next morning."
00:10:58.949,00:11:02.161,"At first, Medellín and Cali worked side by side."
00:11:03.329,00:11:07.291,"But in Colombia, when money's involved, blood inevitably flows."
00:11:08.292,00:11:11.462,There had been violence between Medellín and Cali before.
00:11:11.545,00:11:15.257,"But right now, a war on two fronts was not something Pablo could afford."
00:11:20.679,00:11:24.266,"- Yes, for a price. - Certainly."
00:11:24.350,00:11:29.772,"Look, Pacho, we agreed that we would share the Los Angeles territory..."
00:11:30.689,00:11:32.441,and that hasn't been happening.
00:11:32.650,00:11:36.237,It seems you are not holding up our agreement.
00:11:36.445,00:11:39.949,"- How's that? - Exactly what I'm saying, Pacho."
00:11:45.496,00:11:46.997,"Look, Pablo..."
00:11:48.082,00:11:52.086,you know that our partners sometimes operate independently.
00:11:52.169,00:11:58.509,"If Mr. Galeano and Mr. Moncada are correct, then you have my assurance that it will be rectified."
00:11:58.634,00:12:00.010,"Thanks a lot, Pacho."
00:12:00.219,00:12:04.223,Disputes between us cause needless bloodshed.
00:12:04.306,00:12:10.020,Then fix it. A war between our groups is the last thing we need right now.
00:12:11.981,00:12:14.233,It would seem you already have a war.
00:12:15.276,00:12:17.862,Maybe bombing that plane was a step too far.
00:12:19.947,00:12:21.490,"Careful, Pacho."
00:12:21.574,00:12:25.953,Careful. The only difference between us is our little misunderstanding with the government.
00:12:26.036,00:12:27.830,And that will be resolved soon.
00:12:28.038,00:12:29.999,"Besides, that's the business, for all of us."
00:12:30.082,00:12:31.959,"- Yes, it's true for all of us. - Mm-hm."
00:12:32.168,00:12:35.254,The only war we are really fighting is the war against extradition.
00:12:35.463,00:12:37.798,And the outcome of that is something we're all interested in.
00:12:37.882,00:12:41.218,"It's true, Gustavo. Gustavo is right."
00:12:41.302,00:12:44.722,"We have a common goal, and that is to get rid of extradition."
00:12:45.431,00:12:49.310,The United States is big enough for all of us to operate in.
00:12:49.393,00:12:54.398,Let's figure out Los Angeles once you take care of your business here.
00:12:59.111,00:13:00.404,You know what bothers me?
00:13:02.698,00:13:04.283,Your arrogance.
00:13:05.242,00:13:07.578,"Your attitude, your air of superiority."
00:13:09.371,00:13:15.336,"Careful, Pacho... that you don't get yourself killed for that."
00:13:24.929,00:13:26.805,Thank you for coming.
00:13:46.492,00:13:47.743,"Stop talking shit, Moncada."
00:13:47.952,00:13:51.872,"We'll kill that fag later. Right now, we can't be out in the open."
00:13:51.956,00:14:01.882,"If that son of a bitch starts selling shit in Los Angeles, I'm personally gonna put a gun up his ass and pull the trigger. I swear."
00:14:02.091,00:14:04.510,That will make him fall in love with you.
00:14:10.182,00:14:13.102,"Poison, La Quica, Sure Shot, Blackie."
00:14:13.185,00:14:16.021,"Cocky, careless motherfuckers."
00:14:16.105,00:14:22.152,"Now we're hearing about two new guys: Fernando Galeano and Kiko Moncada, basically picking up where Carlos Lehder left off."
00:14:24.363,00:14:27.074,"Without Colombian permission to put assets in the air, we can't help."
00:14:27.283,00:14:30.995,"In terms of intercepts, yeah, but what do you guys got on ground intel?"
00:14:35.708,00:14:38.210,We don't have any narco assets.
00:14:38.294,00:14:41.297,Our human intelligence is limited to communists.
00:14:41.380,00:14:45.926,"Besides, Gaviria doesn't want you chasing Escobar with CIA spies."
00:14:46.135,00:14:47.720,"But you got satellites in the sky, right?"
00:14:47.928,00:14:54.393,"Yes, but to use them in pursuit of narcos would be a direct violation - of the order of our host country. - Man, you're CIA."
00:14:54.476,00:14:55.936,You break rules all the time.
00:14:57.897,00:15:02.443,These are aerial photographs of comunas controlled by Escobar and his associates.
00:15:04.653,00:15:08.616,- We can't track individuals with these. - Take a look.
00:15:08.699,00:15:11.994,The Los Priscos gang controls El Poblado.
00:15:12.077,00:15:15.331,"Here in Santa Cruz, we got the comuna where they recruited the Avianca bomber."
00:15:15.414,00:15:18.626,And both places more densely packed than a Marrakesh bazaar.
00:15:18.709,00:15:20.711,So let's take a tip from the Colombians.
00:15:22.338,00:15:24.673,You notice anything special about these?
00:15:25.758,00:15:28.969,Search Bloc follows vehicle traffic in the comunas. You've got...
00:15:30.387,00:15:34.600,Japanese imports... four-by-fours. Cars over 40 grand.
00:15:36.894,00:15:38.729,Narcos are the only ones who can afford these cars.
00:15:38.938,00:15:41.523,"Whenever aerials see these cars, we know sicarios are inside."
00:15:41.732,00:15:46.737,"- That's right. - We start tracking these rice rockets, we might be able to get to Escobar."
00:16:02.670,00:16:04.171,I don't want to shoot her.
00:16:05.005,00:16:07.758,"Kill that cute girl? And the baby, too?"
00:16:07.841,00:16:11.553,I don't know why the boss wants us to kill that girl.
00:16:13.472,00:16:17.226,- What does she know about Avianca anyway? - Just shut up and follow orders!
00:16:22.356,00:16:23.899,is gonna get the police to quit chasing him?
00:16:31.115,00:16:33.117,And go where?
00:16:33.200,00:16:36.370,We'll be treated like criminals wherever we go.
00:16:39.164,00:16:42.626,"They'll kill him, and you know it."
00:16:42.710,00:16:45.754,I just hope he doesn't take you down with him.
00:16:59.018,00:17:02.646,Don't you understand what an opportunity this is?
00:17:02.730,00:17:10.738,"He's willing to consider terms of surrender-- My God, he just blew up a plane!"
00:17:10.821,00:17:13.157,"Eduardo, calm down. Let the man speak."
00:17:18.787,00:17:21.915,Do you realize how stupid you sound right now?
00:17:21.999,00:17:23.208,"César, this is absurd."
00:17:23.292,00:17:25.127,"- Eduardo, please-- - This is a farce."
00:17:25.210,00:17:26.545,Please.
00:17:27.588,00:17:31.258,Let me deal with this. Please.
00:17:31.341,00:17:33.594,Fine. Whatever you want.
00:17:42.227,00:17:48.358,"Even though you never stated it, surely you'd like to see the bombings stop."
00:17:49.693,00:17:52.738,"- Yes. Yes, I would. - Exactly."
00:17:52.821,00:17:56.158,"So if we begin a dialogue, they will cease."
00:17:56.241,00:18:01.288,"That affords us all some time, including the Search Bloc."
00:18:02.664,00:18:03.749,Fernando...
00:18:09.505,00:18:11.673,That son of a bitch has no soul.
00:18:16.470,00:18:22.309,If telling him we're negotiating allows the bombs to stop while we find him...
00:18:23.936,00:18:25.270,then be my guest.
00:18:30.317,00:18:34.238,"Thank you. Really, thank you."
00:19:23.495,00:19:25.706,"Look, man, Pablo's turned into a saint."
00:19:25.789,00:19:27.124,Of course.
00:19:56.153,00:19:59.656,She's not here. She might have just left.
00:20:00.616,00:20:02.701,Let's search the comuna.
00:20:03.869,00:20:06.413,"Look, Poison, I'm telling you Pablo is being paranoid."
00:20:06.496,00:20:08.540,"Careful what you say, son."
00:20:09.625,00:20:12.211,"One day, he is going to ask me to kill you."
00:20:14.254,00:20:16.173,Would you do it?
00:20:16.256,00:20:18.967,If he asks me... of course.
00:20:19.718,00:20:21.511,There is no way around it.
00:20:23.055,00:20:24.890,Wouldn't you?
00:20:31.855,00:20:34.358,"All right, all right, let's just go find this girl."
00:20:34.441,00:20:36.693,We'll look around and see where she's hiding.
00:20:40.739,00:20:42.157,Here you go.
00:20:42.366,00:20:44.701,"It's OK, Natalie. Don't worry."
00:20:44.785,00:20:49.623,"Before you know it, we'll get you some food. Right? Isn't that right?"
00:20:49.706,00:20:50.874,Thank you.
00:21:05.013,00:21:07.057,"What then, Fernando?"
00:21:07.140,00:21:09.977,Has the Colombian government offered a truce?
00:21:11.770,00:21:16.275,The government hasn't been willing to offer anything I would consider acceptable.
00:21:16.483,00:21:18.068,What did they offer?
00:21:23.740,00:21:25.325,that you're responsible for Avianca.
00:21:25.409,00:21:30.372,"And of course, I told them that-- That we can't even-- Is it that you're not negotiating a thing?"
00:21:30.455,00:21:39.631,"No, no, of course I'm negotiating-- Then why is Carrillo stopping every car in the comunas and killing my boys with the help of the gringos?!"
00:21:40.966,00:21:45.637,"Why are the Americans helping them if we are supposed to be negotiating, Fernando?"
00:21:47.723,00:21:52.728,Gaviria doesn't want the gringos to know he's willing to negotiate with you.
00:21:55.355,00:21:56.523,That's it.
00:22:02.279,00:22:04.364,"Be very careful, Fernando."
00:22:09.119,00:22:09.953,"Yes, Pablo."
00:22:13.498,00:22:14.333,Yes.
00:22:36.354,00:22:38.231,"You've got to stop the bombing, Pablo."
00:22:39.858,00:22:44.780,I don't know what you're thinking anymore.
00:22:47.532,00:22:49.659,I think we should...
00:22:51.244,00:22:53.330,reorganize a bit...
00:22:54.539,00:23:03.965,and start sending our boys out to burn some houses down and do some damage to politicians and senators all over the country.
00:23:04.174,00:23:14.267,"And to the soldiers and cops in our way, the judges who annoy us and the reporters that watch us, basically, we have to create a presence so disruptive they'll want nothing but peace."
00:23:14.476,00:23:17.646,That's the only way we're going to get there.
00:23:17.729,00:23:22.317,Is that it? Is that what you want? A civil war?
00:23:24.611,00:23:27.656,"- You've gone crazy, asshole. - We have to fight, brother."
00:23:28.824,00:23:31.159,Let's put our hearts into this.
00:23:33.036,00:23:35.872,"And if we all must die, so be it."
00:23:38.750,00:23:40.168,"Well, yes..."
00:23:43.547,00:23:46.133,"The thing is, I don't want to die yet, Pablo."
00:23:55.809,00:23:57.269,Nor do I.
00:24:00.230,00:24:02.649,But the bombs make the public want peace.
00:24:02.858,00:24:05.402,And that will influence the politicians.
00:24:14.953,00:24:20.792,You're the one who says the politicians don't give a shit about the public.
00:24:21.626,00:24:26.339,"If you want to influence politicians, you'll have to narrow your focus."
00:24:27.382,00:24:28.425,You know what I mean?
00:24:33.263,00:24:38.393,"They needed a new strategy, one that brought terror directly to the people that mattered the most."
00:24:40.145,00:24:42.397,"No, she is way too much of a princess."
00:24:42.480,00:24:43.982,Surely we would have problems with her.
00:24:44.191,00:24:46.067,"My God, look at that face."
00:24:46.276,00:24:50.071,"The media is going to love that fox, right?"
00:24:53.200,00:24:54.826,Just think what they're gonna do to her.
00:24:55.911,00:24:56.828,Well...
00:24:57.954,00:25:00.540,I say let's start with her...
00:25:08.798,00:25:09.883,...and this fag.
00:25:15.472,00:25:16.723,Let's go!
00:25:20.268,00:25:21.228,And this cute couple.
00:25:29.402,00:25:34.282,"Now, you take someone's children away from them, you'd be amazed what they'd do to get them back."
00:25:38.245,00:25:42.040,have been kidnapped on the very streets they call home.
00:25:42.999,00:25:44.960,What does Pablo Escobar want?
00:25:56.137,00:25:57.889,Is everything all right?
00:26:00.642,00:26:02.978,All the victims are my friends.
00:26:19.661,00:26:20.787,Excuse me.
00:26:27.752,00:26:35.635,"the editor in chief of the most important newspaper in the nation, is the latest and most shocking in a string of kidnappings orchestrated by the Medellín cartel."
00:26:35.719,00:26:37.429,"Reporting to you, I'm Valeria Velez."
00:26:38.305,00:26:42.934,"- All right. - First on the scene, right? As always."
00:26:48.315,00:26:50.900,you'd be hungry enough to get here first.
00:26:51.609,00:26:53.945,I found out from Santos' wife...
00:26:54.029,00:26:56.948,a half hour after he didn't show up for dinner.
00:26:57.782,00:26:58.867,You?
00:26:59.868,00:27:00.952,Who tipped you off?
00:27:02.620,00:27:04.289,"It's a pleasure to see you, as always."
00:27:29.898,00:27:32.817,"You've read them, you can see they're very reasonable."
00:27:32.901,00:27:34.319,"Very reasonable, he says."
00:27:35.487,00:27:38.365,"You are definitely an imbecile, Fernando."
00:27:38.573,00:27:40.450,And I'm going to tell you something.
00:27:40.533,00:27:44.746,"You will get what you deserve very soon, I assure you."
00:27:52.837,00:27:54.798,I'm also one of those hostages.
00:27:55.715,00:28:02.222,"I myself could be walking around calmly... but like them, I am not free."
00:28:06.684,00:28:10.772,"Escobar is asking us to surrender, but that will never happen."
00:28:13.108,00:28:18.488,"If he releases the hostages and turns himself in, we will take this into account."
00:28:21.408,00:28:23.368,Gaviria isn't going to bend.
00:28:26.496,00:28:28.540,Then I'm going to break him.
00:28:36.756,00:28:38.800,"You, get up from there."
00:28:47.767,00:28:53.148,The body of Ofelia Hernandez was found dumped next to the Presidential Palace.
00:28:53.940,00:29:00.530,One must admire President Gaviria. I'm sure it can't be easy for him to stand by his decision to not negotiate with Escobar.
00:29:05.785,00:29:08.329,A few more hostages and they will give in.
00:29:10.957,00:29:13.376,Their time is running out.
00:29:13.460,00:29:15.253,I'm talking about us.
00:29:17.130,00:29:19.466,"What about us, Valeria?"
00:29:24.512,00:29:27.807,I don't have time for that pussy shit right now.
00:29:35.899,00:29:41.446,You know the only reason this hag has any fame is because her father was president.
00:29:42.530,00:29:44.908,I despise her.
00:29:46.451,00:29:48.536,And why do you care so much?
00:29:54.083,00:29:56.252,Hers are higher.
00:30:29.911,00:30:31.037,Move!
00:30:34.415,00:30:35.542,Hurry up!
00:31:22.922,00:31:24.048,Hello!
00:31:25.800,00:31:27.302,Tell me where I am.
00:31:29.095,00:31:31.222,Does my family know I'm alive?
00:31:36.686,00:31:37.937,Who are you?
00:31:39.856,00:31:41.983,You work for Escobar?
00:31:43.526,00:31:45.153,You can call me Gorilla.
00:31:47.864,00:31:48.698,Gorilla.
00:31:50.783,00:31:53.328,Very well... Gorilla.
00:31:54.662,00:31:56.122,Where's my crew?
00:31:57.999,00:31:59.500,Did you bring them here as well?
00:32:01.544,00:32:05.465,I'm here to guard you. That's it.
00:32:31.115,00:32:33.284,"Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me."
00:32:33.493,00:32:43.503,"We understand the frustration and pain you must be feeling for your children, but believe me, we are doing everything we can to make sure your children get home soon."
00:32:43.586,00:32:46.381,Our daughter was kidnapped on her way to an interview.
00:32:46.464,00:32:49.759,They killed the bodyguard. No one is safe.
00:32:49.842,00:32:55.056,"As a former president, I understand the terrible position you're in."
00:32:55.139,00:32:58.935,But we're here to find a solution.
00:32:59.143,00:33:01.938,"I understand your frustration, Dr. Turbay."
00:33:02.855,00:33:08.778,"But if we give in now, any criminal can hold our government hostage."
00:33:08.861,00:33:13.074,This isn't any criminal. This is the worst criminal in the world.
00:33:15.618,00:33:20.999,"you're proceeding as you must, but we must act as the parents of our children."
00:33:21.082,00:33:23.960,Let's pray you find a solution.
00:33:29.215,00:33:32.051,It's the internal pressure that can wear you down.
00:33:33.845,00:33:37.724,We knew the clock was ticking before Gaviria had to cave in to Escobar...
00:33:38.766,00:33:43.021,but hopefully not before our unauthorized operation struck gold.
00:33:43.855,00:33:47.942,Catching a top sicario could be the break we needed in leading us to Pablo.
00:33:48.026,00:33:48.901,Here.
00:33:49.110,00:33:52.864,We'd continue to join in an observational capacity.
00:33:57.952,00:34:01.581,"I don't know. Someone paid me 50,000 pesos to drive it around the city."
00:34:04.459,00:34:07.920,So they traded down to junkers to avoid our eye in the sky.
00:34:08.004,00:34:11.049,But we weren't the only ones that had Pablo in the gun sights.
00:34:16.721,00:34:18.139,The Los Angeles problems.
00:34:23.728,00:34:27.899,He's managed to secure some very effective bargaining chips.
00:34:27.982,00:34:30.860,"Of course, he'll look after you guys, right?"
00:34:30.943,00:34:34.405,We haven't talked to Pablo in weeks. He's in hiding.
00:34:35.740,00:34:38.493,"Look at that. What a beautiful animal, Jorge."
00:34:38.576,00:34:39.619,You like it?
00:34:40.369,00:34:41.746,"Yes, of course."
00:34:41.829,00:34:45.625,"I'm sure he'll look after you. After all, you're partners."
00:34:45.833,00:34:47.543,"Yes, of course. Partners."
00:34:56.928,00:34:58.805,What do you mean?
00:34:59.722,00:35:02.058,"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you knew."
00:35:02.266,00:35:06.020,It could be gossip. You know how people like to talk.
00:35:14.070,00:35:16.614,"You should eat, because you're going to be here a while."
00:35:16.697,00:35:18.574,You're going to get very hungry.
00:35:19.700,00:35:21.786,I don't feel well.
00:35:21.869,00:35:25.540,What's wrong? Are you sick?
00:35:25.623,00:35:27.625,I can get you some medicine.
00:35:29.168,00:35:31.712,It's not that kind of illness.
00:35:32.922,00:35:39.137,I want to congratulate you. I know you're a very good reporter.
00:35:40.638,00:35:41.764,Thank you.
00:35:44.225,00:35:46.727,"Gorilla, how long have you been working for Escobar?"
00:35:46.936,00:35:50.523,"Oh, it's been a while."
00:35:50.606,00:35:53.985,"So you know what's going on out there, don't you?"
00:35:54.068,00:35:58.739,"The truth is, I don't go out, so I have no idea what's happening."
00:36:00.158,00:36:03.452,"What the fuck are you doing, Gorilla? Why isn't she wearing the blindfold?"
00:36:03.536,00:36:04.871,I didn't know you were coming.
00:36:04.954,00:36:08.166,"Put it on, man! We have to take her."
00:36:08.374,00:36:09.417,Put that on.
00:36:10.585,00:36:14.630,- Says who? - Didn't I tell you to stay quiet?
00:36:30.313,00:36:33.149,"Pleasure to finally meet you, Ms. Turbay."
00:36:34.650,00:36:36.277,"Sit down, please."
00:37:08.643,00:37:10.853,I suppose you want me to interview you?
00:37:11.979,00:37:14.398,"No, even better."
00:37:14.482,00:37:17.109,I'm going to interview you.
00:37:17.318,00:37:21.697,So you can tell the world about the humane treatment you've received here.
00:37:26.577,00:37:29.372,Don't you want your parents to know you're well?
00:37:30.623,00:37:32.416,That you're alive?
00:37:37.546,00:37:40.967,I don't want to become a piece of propaganda for you.
00:37:42.843,00:37:44.303,Who do you think you are?
00:37:50.434,00:37:54.480,"So what's necessary, miss, to have your cooperation?"
00:38:02.488,00:38:04.532,Let one of the hostages go.
00:38:08.452,00:38:11.622,You and I know that I'm the one you really want.
00:38:27.722,00:38:31.392,Two reasonable people coming to an agreement.
00:38:32.768,00:38:38.316,Maybe we can convince President Gaviria to do the same. Right?
00:38:42.236,00:38:45.656,Mr. Escobar has shown a willingness to negotiate.
00:38:47.033,00:38:50.202,"This afternoon, he let one of the hostages go."
00:38:50.286,00:38:52.371,President Gaviria...
00:39:03.466,00:39:04.800,I don't understand.
00:39:04.884,00:39:07.845,"I thought you said he wouldn't bend, but now he's let one go."
00:39:08.054,00:39:10.181,Because he has your daughter.
00:39:10.264,00:39:13.100,And she's worth more to him than the rest of them combined.
00:39:14.810,00:39:18.981,"If you knew all I know, you'd understand it's nothing more than a stunt."
00:39:19.190,00:39:20.691,Give him what he wants.
00:39:20.775,00:39:23.235,What he wants is an insult to us and to this country.
00:39:23.444,00:39:25.154,I don't care. I want my child!
00:39:27.948,00:39:31.660,we'd like you to make a deal with Escobar.
00:39:32.578,00:39:36.040,"If you refuse, we'll have to take certain measures."
00:39:36.248,00:39:48.094,"Financially, by robbing you of donors... and politically, by robbing you of whatever support your legislative agenda needs."
00:39:51.514,00:39:52.681,Are you threatening me?
00:39:53.557,00:39:55.976,We all use the tools at our disposal.
00:39:56.060,00:40:00.272,"You as a politician, me as a father. I'm sorry."
00:40:01.649,00:40:03.025,Doctor...
00:40:04.276,00:40:07.113,you told me to follow my instincts...
00:40:08.406,00:40:11.617,and they tell me not to give in to this criminal.
00:40:11.826,00:40:14.161,That was before they took my daughter.
00:40:59.498,00:41:03.252,I came over as quickly as I could. I was told you needed me urgently.
00:41:03.335,00:41:04.712,What's up?
00:41:07.131,00:41:07.965,You OK?
00:41:12.219,00:41:16.807,Tell Fernando... I'm willing to open negotiations.
00:41:18.517,00:41:21.645,We'll make a counter to Escobar's demands.
00:41:22.396,00:41:24.398,I thought you weren't going to negotiate.
00:41:30.029,00:41:32.239,"I have to stop this madness, Eduardo."
00:41:33.824,00:41:37.786,"But God willing, we can catch him first."
00:41:42.541,00:41:45.753,Tell the Americans they can put their planes in the air.
00:41:51.884,00:41:55.596,Negotiate with a terrorist while trying to catch him at the same time.
00:42:02.394,00:42:05.648,"Manrique, from known sicario satellite phones."
00:42:10.861,00:42:12.321,"Yes, we're here in Campo Valdés."
00:42:13.614,00:42:15.199,Campo Valdés.
00:42:15.282,00:42:18.410,"That's in the central eastern area, bordered by the Comuna Popular."
00:42:18.494,00:42:19.954,Roger that.
00:42:20.037,00:42:21.413,Campo Valdés.
00:42:24.500,00:42:26.794,that's about the most dangerous thing you can do.
00:42:29.838,00:42:31.966,"All right, all right. All right."
00:42:32.174,00:42:34.760,That's how bad we wanted to catch these guys.
00:42:38.055,00:42:41.934,I swear I didn't hear anything! I'm not going to say anything!
00:42:42.017,00:42:44.311,"Please, don't kill me."
00:42:44.395,00:42:46.146,- I'm not-- - Hey! Hey!
00:42:46.355,00:42:49.733,"- Please, don't kill me! - What?"
00:42:57.032,00:43:02.121,You could have at least waited till I got her off me. Look at me now! Huh?
00:43:02.204,00:43:04.331,You got blood all over my new shoes.
00:43:04.415,00:43:07.626,I don't give a shit about your shoes. Stop bitching.
00:43:08.836,00:43:10.129,I'm not.
00:43:11.463,00:43:12.423,What about her?
00:43:19.013,00:43:20.389,Put a bullet in her.
00:43:26.186,00:43:28.564,"What? The baby's not a witness, man."
00:43:28.772,00:43:30.816,I don't give a shit.
00:43:30.899,00:43:33.652,"- Pablo told us to kill everyone. - Yeah, but it's a baby."
00:43:33.736,00:43:35.988,She won't say shit in court.
00:43:36.822,00:43:39.533,If she grows up and talks?
00:43:39.617,00:43:42.995,Really? Do you remember what your mom told you when you were two?
00:43:43.203,00:43:49.043,Why is it so fucking difficult for you to follow Pablo's orders? Huh?
00:45:59.256,00:46:02.050,"You're under arrest, you son of a bitch."
00:46:02.259,00:46:03.302,Let him go!
00:46:13.604,00:46:14.605,Let him go!
00:46:14.813,00:46:17.065,- Put the gun down. - You put yours down.
00:46:18.317,00:46:20.235,I don't want to have to kill you.
00:46:21.570,00:46:22.404,I will.
00:46:58.023,00:46:59.149,Fuck!
00:47:41.900,00:47:43.318,Hey.
00:48:13.265,00:48:14.391,Well...
00:48:16.059,00:48:18.478,"we have to spend some time in jail, right?"
00:48:18.562,00:48:20.355,So what the fuck.
00:48:21.732,00:48:24.359,"You won, Pablo. They gave in."
00:48:24.443,00:48:31.491,But that faggot president has yet to accept our most important demand before we turn ourselves in.
00:48:32.284,00:48:33.910,Which demand is that?
00:48:39.207,00:48:41.251,"It's been a while since we've been up here, right?"
00:48:41.335,00:48:42.377,Yeah.
00:48:44.630,00:48:48.091,We used to come up here with our girlfriends and smoke a joint.
00:48:50.344,00:48:52.554,What does that have to do with anything?
00:49:03.607,00:49:07.319,"From here, we can see anything coming."
00:49:07.402,00:49:11.031,And we have enough space to build whatever we want.
00:49:13.200,00:49:15.577,We're going to design it...
00:49:17.788,00:49:19.706,we're going to build it...
00:49:21.124,00:49:24.961,and we will be protected from all our enemies.
00:49:27.214,00:49:30.759,"- You want to build a jail? - Not a jail, cousin."
00:49:32.844,00:49:34.471,A castle.
00:00:23.857,00:00:28.778,I'm gonna shoot every fucking hostage in the head. That's right.
00:00:28.862,00:00:30.071,Who's doing this?
00:00:30.280,00:00:32.866,"Carrillo and Search Bloc, I'm sure of it."
00:00:32.949,00:00:36.619,- In the middle of our negotiations? - Either Gaviria is trying to catch me...
00:00:46.713,00:00:49.883,"You know what we have to do, Pablo. We have to close the deal fast..."
00:00:49.966,00:00:52.218,before they find us and kill us.
00:00:53.887,00:00:57.640,Not before we build our own jail.
00:00:58.600,00:01:06.232,"And that fucking pussy president will have to agree to that, even if I have to stick a bomb up his ass."
00:01:07.317,00:01:10.236,It's so fucking cold. Is there a jacket there for me?
00:01:10.320,00:01:12.739,"- Check it out, fag. - What's up?"
00:01:15.075,00:01:18.369,It's a miniskirt with your name on it.
00:01:18.453,00:01:20.747,- Gustavo Gaviria. - Give me that.
00:01:24.542,00:01:26.711,"All right, let's call the boys."
00:01:29.923,00:01:33.802,And what about you? Are you all right?
00:01:34.886,00:01:38.890,"If Gaviria'd let us put US boots on the ground, we would've caught the son of a bitch in five minutes."
00:01:39.057,00:01:42.101,I wouldn't be too sure about that. Escobar is a lot smarter than he looks.
00:01:44.354,00:01:47.148,We picked up a signal in the woods surrounding the target area.
00:01:49.275,00:01:52.028,Pick us up at El Mariano pass.
00:01:55.824,00:01:57.450,"Yeah, don't count your chickens just yet."
00:02:01.663,00:02:03.706,five clicks from the finca.
00:02:03.790,00:02:06.668,Request Colombian units to be sent ASAP.
00:02:08.294,00:02:11.923,we are registering the latitude and longitude at a fixed point.
00:02:12.006,00:02:14.592,The subject appears to have stopped moving.
00:04:10.625,00:04:11.668,Again.
00:04:12.710,00:04:14.254,- Shh. - You hear what I said?
00:04:20.885,00:04:23.513,"Yeah, I'm a little preoccupied, Steve."
00:04:26.975,00:04:28.059,What is that?
00:04:28.142,00:04:31.396,"Well, it means she can't sleep, which means neither can I."
00:04:33.481,00:04:35.650,Did you call the orphanages?
00:04:35.733,00:04:39.279,"You think I could explain the situation in English, let alone Spanish?"
00:04:39.487,00:04:42.365,I still don't understand why you brought her back here.
00:04:42.448,00:04:44.075,"Well, let's take her to a hospital."
00:04:44.284,00:04:48.246,"No, Steve, we can't just take her to a hospital. It's not like a puppy shelter."
00:04:48.329,00:04:51.666,"Look, I know you're busy, but we've gotta figure out what we're gonna do with her."
00:04:51.874,00:04:53.209,"There's a war going on, Connie."
00:04:53.293,00:04:55.628,You said it was only gonna be for a couple of days.
00:04:55.712,00:04:58.756,It's already been a week. What are we doing here?
00:05:00.258,00:05:03.511,- Is that my t-shirt? - We're out of diapers.
00:05:03.594,00:05:07.015,Why don't you go get some more before she shits through your whole closet?
00:05:23.948,00:05:26.909,"Careful, son. This woman is very clever."
00:05:26.993,00:05:29.954,She can grab your gun and shoot you in the head.
00:05:30.038,00:05:31.581,"My apologies, boss."
00:05:44.177,00:05:45.636,How do you feel?
00:05:48.056,00:05:50.308,As well as one might expect.
00:05:51.100,00:05:54.103,I need you to record another tape for me.
00:05:55.646,00:05:57.273,No.
00:05:58.399,00:06:00.902,"No, not until you free more hostages."
00:06:02.361,00:06:06.074,Maruja is very ill. Ricardo has an ulcer.
00:06:06.157,00:06:08.951,I'm the only one you need to negotiate.
00:06:09.035,00:06:12.580,Then why does the Colombian government keep trying to capture me?
00:06:14.832,00:06:16.084,Look...
00:06:17.919,00:06:20.755,I admire your bravery very much.
00:06:20.838,00:06:26.719,"But Gaviria is a piece of shit, and, with all due respect, so is your father."
00:06:26.803,00:06:28.679,And what did you expect?
00:06:29.597,00:06:31.766,To get into Congress like it was nothing?
00:06:32.767,00:06:36.020,"Without it mattering that you, in fact, traffic drugs?"
00:06:41.692,00:06:45.613,You had respect when you built homes for the poor.
00:06:46.948,00:06:53.329,"But when you didn't get that respect from a herd of egocentric bureaucrats, you threw a tantrum."
00:06:56.582,00:07:01.212,I was going to do marvelous things for this country.
00:07:03.798,00:07:12.014,"If I have made myself into a monster, like all of you say, that is the fault of people like your father..."
00:07:12.098,00:07:14.976,and those politicians of always.
00:07:16.436,00:07:28.322,Those oligarchs and those people were never going to tolerate that little paisa from Medellín who had more money and was more intelligent than all of them.
00:07:29.949,00:07:31.284,Yes.
00:07:32.285,00:07:34.996,You would have done marvelous things.
00:07:36.414,00:07:38.374,And that is the saddest part.
00:07:39.834,00:07:45.047,Mr. Escobar has promised to free two more hostages.
00:07:45.131,00:07:50.428,"But in exchange, he has asked that you continue negotiations with transparency."
00:07:55.391,00:07:57.727,He knows.
00:07:57.810,00:08:02.148,If you insist on trying to capture him with the help of the Americans...
00:08:04.775,00:08:06.402,they're going to kill us all.
00:08:10.907,00:08:13.951,You are risking my daughter's life!
00:08:14.035,00:08:17.497,"No, Nydia, with all due respect, we are not risking anyone's life."
00:08:17.580,00:08:21.375,Our priority is the life of your daughter and the lives of the rest of the hostages.
00:08:21.584,00:08:25.087,But our priority is also to capture Escobar.
00:08:25.296,00:08:27.757,You cannot have both things at once.
00:08:27.840,00:08:30.927,Negotiate with Escobar while trying to capture him?
00:08:31.135,00:08:33.638,Do you know what he is demanding?
00:08:35.348,00:08:39.977,That we call a constitutional referendum to abolish extradition.
00:08:40.186,00:08:45.358,That he only plead guilty to having trafficked drugs one time.
00:08:45.441,00:08:52.448,"And worst of all, he wants to build his own jail and have his own guards to watch over him."
00:08:52.532,00:08:54.909,This is a deal with the devil.
00:08:55.117,00:08:59.455,You are the president of a country that became a living hell some time ago.
00:08:59.664,00:09:02.875,With whom else did you expect to be making a deal?
00:09:08.047,00:09:10.299,before he could cut one with Pablo.
00:09:10.383,00:09:14.011,Bowing to Pablo's demands was political suicide.
00:09:14.095,00:09:17.932,"So, he did what politicians do best: he stalled."
00:09:18.015,00:09:21.561,He kept our planes in the air and prayed to God that we got a hit.
00:09:38.369,00:09:39.745,Miss Diana...
00:09:40.997,00:09:43.583,why are you so unpleasant with the boss?
00:09:45.418,00:09:48.379,"You are loyal like a sheep, aren't you?"
00:09:49.922,00:09:56.345,"That man is your kidnapper... and mine, and that of the whole nation."
00:09:56.429,00:09:58.014,"Here, you go first."
00:10:31.213,00:10:33.257,"Hide in here, quickly!"
00:11:00.368,00:11:04.288,Pablo didn't even have to pull the trigger. We did it for him.
00:11:15.466,00:11:18.219,Diana's death was the final straw.
00:11:20.763,00:11:25.226,Her presence on the nation's TV screens and in their homes transcended class.
00:11:26.102,00:11:28.354,The people were devastated.
00:11:28.437,00:11:32.233,"For President Gaviria, there was little room left to move."
00:11:37.655,00:11:39.323,You killed my daughter.
00:11:40.658,00:11:41.826,Let her pass.
00:11:42.034,00:11:43.536,Wait...
00:11:45.329,00:11:48.833,"If you had accepted his terms, my daughter would still be alive!"
00:11:51.919,00:11:54.255,Give him whatever he wants.
00:11:54.338,00:11:58.008,Don't let others go through the suffering we've had to endure.
00:11:58.092,00:12:00.636,Mr. President... we need to leave.
00:12:07.351,00:12:09.353,"God be with you, Nydia."
00:12:27.955,00:12:29.957,There's something I want to make very clear.
00:12:30.040,00:12:35.087,You are not to blame for Diana's death. OK? That has to be clear.
00:12:36.881,00:12:39.633,Escobar has the resources for this to go on forever.
00:12:39.717,00:12:41.385,"Yes, and so do we."
00:12:41.469,00:12:43.095,We are the state.
00:12:43.179,00:12:47.016,"We are going to fight, do whatever we have to do, and we are going to finish him."
00:12:47.099,00:12:49.685,We have options.
00:12:49.768,00:12:53.647,"For instance, why don't we allow the American military to come in?"
00:12:53.731,00:12:57.568,I know-- We don't like it. I personally don't like it.
00:12:57.651,00:13:01.739,"But if it's a specific, clear mission-- - No. - Something covert."
00:13:01.822,00:13:02.948,No!
00:13:07.244,00:13:09.747,It's time to end all of this.
00:13:14.460,00:13:16.462,Give Escobar what he wants.
00:13:37.191,00:13:39.944,- We're a paper fucking tiger! - Everything we have done is lost.
00:13:41.946,00:13:45.741,"The people, the public... it's tired of all these bombs and bloodshed!"
00:13:45.824,00:13:49.703,"Right, and business goes as usual, - he just runs it from that jail. - Exactly!"
00:13:49.787,00:13:53.415,"All things considered, it's a victory to put Escobar in jail."
00:13:54.792,00:13:56.210,For public relations?
00:13:56.418,00:13:58.045,It's capitulation.
00:13:59.129,00:14:01.298,You want Escobar.
00:14:01.382,00:14:03.133,Why?
00:14:04.093,00:14:06.053,Why?
00:14:06.136,00:14:11.141,Because you want to parade him in your DEA jackets?
00:14:11.225,00:14:13.227,"You think this is a game, right?"
00:14:13.435,00:14:16.647,"This is Colombia, and our people want peace!"
00:14:16.730,00:14:18.899,This is not a fucking game!
00:14:30.327,00:14:33.080,is going to tell us a little something.
00:14:35.291,00:14:45.384,"The Colombian government is going to allow Pablo to turn himself in, accepting only one simple charge: drug trafficking."
00:14:45.467,00:14:47.595,And...
00:14:47.678,00:14:56.020,they are going to let him build a jail which the police cannot be within three kilometers of.
00:14:56.103,00:14:59.523,At last... we have liberated ourselves from tyranny!
00:14:59.607,00:15:02.943,"- Long live Colombia, motherfuckers. - ¡Viva!"
00:15:03.819,00:15:05.613,- Fernando... - Mm?
00:15:07.114,00:15:09.783,"- ...thank you very much. - No problem, Pablo."
00:15:09.867,00:15:14.622,And do you know when Congress is going to vote to abolish extradition?
00:15:14.705,00:15:19.710,"Mm! Yes, it's-- It's a matter of... of weeks."
00:15:19.793,00:15:23.589,"And at that time, you will be able to turn yourself over to the authorities."
00:15:23.672,00:15:27.176,It pleases me very much to finish my work with you with such a great victory.
00:15:27.259,00:15:31.430,"No, brother. Now is when I am going to need your services the most."
00:15:35.684,00:15:38.187,- How-- How's that? - Fernando...
00:15:39.563,00:15:45.861,now it's time for us to find legal means to reduce my sentence even more.
00:15:49.740,00:15:51.367,Right?
00:16:15.641,00:16:21.730,"It means, my love... that now I have a jail."
00:16:24.233,00:16:28.821,"And for you, visiting days will be..."
00:16:32.616,00:16:35.202,"- I'm serious, Pablo. - So am I."
00:16:40.374,00:16:47.423,"now that you have admitted to trafficking in narcotics, my image as a journalist cannot be associated with yours."
00:16:54.013,00:16:55.639,So then...
00:16:58.308,00:17:05.024,now you think I am going to damage your credibility as a journalist... is that it?
00:17:06.984,00:17:09.278,You understand what I'm saying.
00:17:09.361,00:17:12.322,"Oh, yeah, sure. Of course I do."
00:17:14.324,00:17:26.003,"I think that... it's time for me to set you free, so that... you can find a boyfriend who's honest..."
00:17:34.845,00:17:36.805,"No, I'm not joking."
00:17:42.728,00:17:45.189,"that you, Valeria..."
00:17:46.315,00:17:49.735,"are a bandit, just like me."
00:17:53.864,00:17:57.034,So don't come to me with bullshit.
00:18:12.841,00:18:15.886,"Looks like you got away with it, eh, asshole?"
00:18:24.186,00:18:26.688,"Shit, I'd thought you'd gone crazy."
00:18:34.071,00:18:39.118,Geniuses... are always branded as crazy.
00:18:39.201,00:18:42.037,- Am I right? - Yeah.
00:18:47.459,00:18:50.129,- The Ochoas... - The Ochoas what?
00:18:51.296,00:18:54.133,You can bet they're going to be pissed off.
00:18:54.216,00:18:56.093,Because of the treaty?
00:19:13.068,00:19:15.654,"That was a stupid mistake, Gustavo."
00:19:22.244,00:19:24.872,Let's hope they don't charge you for it later.
00:19:27.291,00:19:30.919,Pablo needed to build his jail as fast as possible.
00:19:31.003,00:19:35.215,"As for his enemies, they needed to get to him before that happened."
00:19:35.299,00:19:38.886,"As soon as he walked inside, Pablo would be safe."
00:19:38.969,00:19:41.597,And everyone on the outside wouldn't.
00:19:45.934,00:19:48.187,when Pablo officially surrenders.
00:19:51.857,00:19:55.194,- No cops within two miles of the prison. - This is a fucking sham.
00:19:55.402,00:19:57.571,It's a death warrant for my men.
00:19:58.947,00:20:00.908,I won't be able to protect them.
00:20:03.493,00:20:04.578,I won't let that happen.
00:20:08.248,00:20:11.168,There are cops that hate Escobar just as much as I do.
00:20:12.211,00:20:13.712,More.
00:20:15.631,00:20:18.050,They're not gonna stop just because they're told to.
00:20:18.967,00:20:21.428,You talking about vigilantes?
00:20:21.637,00:20:26.433,Call it what you like... but I'm still gonna need those intel reports.
00:20:26.516,00:20:29.353,"- We'll get you anything we find. - Javi, you gotta cool it with that shit."
00:20:29.436,00:20:32.105,They know we've been helping. One more and we're out.
00:20:32.314,00:20:33.982,I thought you said you were all in.
00:20:39.488,00:20:49.164,"Here, I want to have a little doll house for Manuela, and downstairs, a bar with a Jacuzzi for the guys."
00:20:49.248,00:20:51.792,My family will live in a house down the hill.
00:20:52.000,00:20:56.046,I'm going to install a telescope so I can look at them whenever I want.
00:20:56.255,00:20:59.091,"Yeah, right. More like you can look at other girls' asses."
00:20:59.174,00:21:04.054,"No. The family, the family. To see my kids."
00:21:05.013,00:21:09.351,"- What can we do to help you, Pablo? - Well..."
00:21:09.434,00:21:18.485,"while we're in prison, Gustavo and me, I will count on you, Moncada, and you, Galeano, to oversee operations."
00:21:20.320,00:21:21.822,"Thank you, Pablo."
00:21:21.905,00:21:27.077,We're privileged to be given that responsibility. You can count on us.
00:21:27.160,00:21:30.872,"We've already spoken about the operational plan and everything's clear, right?"
00:21:30.956,00:21:33.083,"Yes. We won't let you down, Pablo."
00:21:33.292,00:21:35.419,Did you tell them about the tax?
00:21:36.628,00:21:38.880,"- No, I didn't. - The tax?"
00:21:38.964,00:21:40.924,What tax is this?
00:21:42.634,00:21:45.429,Who paid for the war we fought?
00:21:45.637,00:21:47.014,You.
00:21:49.057,00:21:52.144,"- You, Don Pablo. - That's right."
00:21:53.562,00:21:56.064,We have peace now.
00:21:56.148,00:21:59.818,You're going to directly benefit from that.
00:22:00.819,00:22:09.036,It's only fair that you contribute to the legal and security costs that Gustavo and I will face behind bars.
00:22:09.953,00:22:12.748,And about how much will that be?
00:22:12.831,00:22:17.461,"We agreed to what, $200,000 a month, right?"
00:22:17.669,00:22:19.713,"Yes, 200 grand."
00:22:19.796,00:22:22.049,200 grand?
00:22:22.132,00:22:26.053,"That's a lot of money, brother. A lot of money."
00:22:26.136,00:22:28.013,But consider it done.
00:22:28.096,00:22:34.978,"And again... thank you very much for this responsibility, - and for considering us. - All right, then."
00:22:47.032,00:22:50.494,"Do you think that was a smart move, Pablo?"
00:22:50.577,00:22:57.375,"Why should I let them reap the fruits of our labor without compensating us for it, Gustavo?"
00:22:59.377,00:23:01.129,I agree with you.
00:23:02.422,00:23:06.551,"But right now, we really need those two fags to be loyal."
00:23:06.760,00:23:09.805,And what? You don't think I inspire loyalty?
00:23:10.013,00:23:13.266,"My loyalty? Yes, you know you have it."
00:23:13.350,00:23:15.477,But I'm not sure about everyone else's.
00:23:16.728,00:23:20.190,"You know, the thing is, Pablo... you won."
00:23:20.273,00:23:22.567,There's no arguing that.
00:23:22.651,00:23:24.486,But you gave in.
00:23:24.569,00:23:28.156,And there are people who will see that as weakness.
00:23:28.240,00:23:33.161,"We've gotta keep our enemies close, now more than ever."
00:23:41.002,00:23:44.131,"It's great to see you again, Valeria."
00:23:45.173,00:23:48.802,"Likewise, Pacho. I'm very happy to see you."
00:23:48.885,00:23:53.265,"Although, I must say... it was a little unexpected."
00:23:54.474,00:23:56.893,We are worried about you.
00:23:57.727,00:24:01.064,And... why are we worried?
00:24:01.273,00:24:04.484,Pablo's cutting a deal with the government.
00:24:04.568,00:24:06.528,He's going to have to admit to certain things.
00:24:06.736,00:24:10.991,Things that may damage your reputation by association.
00:24:13.493,00:24:18.748,"If I'm good at anything, it's protecting my reputation."
00:24:18.957,00:24:21.918,"Listen, this time it's different."
00:24:23.086,00:24:28.383,Look... you helped create that Robin Hood Paisa bullshit.
00:24:28.592,00:24:33.054,"And when it all goes to shit, you'll have to take responsibility for that."
00:24:33.138,00:24:36.016,"Maybe he tricked me, too. Like the rest of the world."
00:24:36.224,00:24:38.185,"You have enemies, see?"
00:24:38.268,00:24:40.145,They're not gonna let you get away with it.
00:24:41.354,00:24:43.356,"Look, Valeria..."
00:24:43.440,00:24:49.029,"we have a lot of connections in New York, a strong presence, you could say."
00:24:49.237,00:24:52.324,"You should go there, at least for a little while."
00:24:52.407,00:24:53.783,And leave Colombia.
00:24:53.992,00:24:57.037,There are a million Colombians there.
00:24:57.120,00:24:59.873,A new audience.
00:24:59.956,00:25:03.001,And they don't care if you shared your bed with a monster or not.
00:25:09.299,00:25:14.554,"When this is all over, you'll be able to come back here with your head held high, I guarantee it."
00:25:15.555,00:25:20.560,"And not only that, you'll have earned a brand-new audience in the United States."
00:25:22.729,00:25:26.524,- Betrayal is not my style. - What betrayal?
00:25:27.609,00:25:29.361,And what would you be betraying?
00:25:33.615,00:25:39.829,You remain loyal to a man who has never thought you good enough to be his wife.
00:25:39.913,00:25:42.582,His wife? Me?
00:25:42.666,00:25:45.335,"No, no, no, you're very much mistaken, my dear."
00:25:45.418,00:25:47.379,The last thing I want is to be married to him.
00:25:48.505,00:25:51.675,Besides... do you think I'd want to be his wife?
00:25:54.261,00:26:00.058,"Do you think I want to be locked up, waiting all day at the Monaco building, while he's out with..."
00:26:02.269,00:26:03.728,with me?
00:26:05.522,00:26:06.856,No.
00:26:07.732,00:26:09.985,That's too boring.
00:26:19.035,00:26:20.996,I missed you so much.
00:26:22.163,00:26:23.832,"I missed you, too."
00:26:33.967,00:26:35.885,"No, it was terrible."
00:26:36.803,00:26:38.388,It was terrible.
00:26:38.471,00:26:41.182,Every day in a different house...
00:26:42.934,00:26:45.020,worried about you...
00:26:46.521,00:26:48.106,the kids...
00:26:53.945,00:26:55.488,The truth is...
00:26:58.116,00:27:00.994,it's very good to be home.
00:27:02.704,00:27:05.623,- You look happy. - Of course.
00:27:08.877,00:27:10.920,That time has passed.
00:27:12.297,00:27:16.551,It's the happiest face I've ever seen on a man about to go to jail.
00:27:25.393,00:27:26.770,"- The kids! - No, Tata!"
00:27:26.853,00:27:28.980,- I have to go to them! - Stay here!
00:27:31.691,00:27:33.860,I'll go get them. Stay here.
00:27:39.157,00:27:40.825,Juan Pablo!
00:27:40.909,00:27:42.786,- Are you OK? - Yes.
00:27:42.869,00:27:44.162,Come on.
00:27:48.625,00:27:51.836,Go to your mother. Go to your mother.
00:28:08.603,00:28:10.939,about 800 pounds' worth of dynamite.
00:28:11.022,00:28:13.817,It made little Manuela forever deaf in one ear.
00:28:16.277,00:28:18.988,the innocent always seemed to be the ones who got hurt.
00:28:21.783,00:28:30.750,"For Escobar, the Monaco bombing told him two things: First, it showed him that the cops weren't his biggest problem."
00:28:32.252,00:28:34.045,They would never use a bomb.
00:28:34.129,00:28:39.718,"This was a new player, one that wasn't above going after his family."
00:28:44.806,00:28:46.975,We're going to kill them all.
00:28:54.774,00:29:00.989,was that for the first time in his life... someone had given him up.
00:29:02.782,00:29:06.244,"And worse yet, he had no idea who."
00:29:24.387,00:29:27.724,- Who was inside? - We don't know.
00:29:31.019,00:29:33.980,That's all the information we have right now.
00:29:34.063,00:29:35.815,"OK, thanks."
00:30:06.805,00:30:08.973,- Marina. - Where are you going?
00:30:10.475,00:30:12.477,I'm going to the city.
00:30:12.560,00:30:14.771,I have to get out of this prison.
00:30:15.772,00:30:18.566,"- Come here, Marina. - Yes?"
00:30:22.487,00:30:24.155,Have a good time.
00:30:24.239,00:30:26.074,Be safe.
00:30:39.087,00:30:41.339,"You know what he's going to do, right?"
00:30:41.422,00:30:47.470,He's going to continue conducting his business behind those walls that are protected by the Colombian government.
00:30:50.515,00:30:54.561,Well... all the more reason that we should negotiate our surrender.
00:30:54.769,00:30:58.106,But you know that Pablo took it upon himself to close that door.
00:30:58.189,00:31:02.986,"So we need to take advantage of your political contacts, especially General Jaramillo."
00:31:03.820,00:31:05.655,Can you talk to him for us?
00:31:05.738,00:31:08.157,"Yes, of course."
00:31:08.241,00:31:10.827,But I don't think it will be enough.
00:31:12.287,00:31:19.294,"That you're going to have to offer something more, something that interests them enough to make a deal with you."
00:31:21.254,00:31:22.839,Gustavo Gaviria.
00:31:24.257,00:31:26.634,He is the key to Pablo's business.
00:31:26.718,00:31:29.012,"If that son of a bitch goes down, the whole empire goes down."
00:31:31.848,00:31:33.766,"Indeed, that could work."
00:31:35.226,00:31:36.686,That could work.
00:31:43.359,00:31:46.029,That's doubly true of drug dealers.
00:31:46.112,00:31:49.824,"The Ochoas, with the help of Cali, made their own surrender deal."
00:31:50.033,00:31:52.994,"No extradition, no stiff sentence."
00:31:53.077,00:32:01.294,The Colombian government was willing to overlook their part in the largest cocaine empire on the face of the earth.
00:32:01.377,00:32:03.838,"Instead, they would serve reduced sentences."
00:32:06.049,00:32:10.011,Illegally importing bulls from Spain. I shit you not.
00:32:10.094,00:32:18.519,"They went to jail with smiles on their faces, 'cause all they had to do was use their sister as bait to catch a fish the cops actually wanted."
00:33:06.442,00:33:08.736,"- You look pretty, baby. - Yeah, sure."
00:33:08.820,00:33:11.864,What I mean is you've always looked pretty.
00:33:23.251,00:33:24.711,Gustavo.
00:33:33.928,00:33:37.765,"Nothing is happening here. Isn't that right, Colonel Carrillo?"
00:33:37.849,00:33:39.726,That's up to you.
00:33:46.190,00:33:50.319,"No, no, no. Gustavo, look at me. Gustav-- Does your family know where you are?"
00:34:00.663,00:34:04.542,We're already in negotiations with the government.
00:34:04.625,00:34:07.962,- You have no reason to be doing this. - You're right.
00:34:09.589,00:34:11.466,That's why I'm not here.
00:34:14.302,00:34:16.471,Then what the fuck do you want?
00:34:18.222,00:34:20.266,Don't act stupid.
00:34:21.225,00:34:25.396,Give me your cousin... and I'll let you live.
00:34:32.403,00:34:33.863,All right.
00:34:35.656,00:34:37.950,"Kill me, then, motherfucker."
00:34:39.077,00:34:40.995,I won't do that myself.
00:34:42.413,00:34:47.126,But I want to introduce you to some people who would love to do it for me.
00:34:48.044,00:34:51.297,This guy? This is Lastia.
00:34:53.007,00:34:58.221,His sister died in a bookstore in Bogotá in a bombing you coordinated.
00:34:58.304,00:35:00.348,She was 17 years old.
00:35:01.390,00:35:03.267,And this guy here...
00:35:06.771,00:35:08.648,this is Trujillo.
00:35:10.775,00:35:15.321,You killed his father and his brother for being cops.
00:35:17.448,00:35:20.368,- That has nothing to do with me. - No?
00:35:21.953,00:35:27.458,"You know... if you support evil, you are evil."
00:35:28.709,00:35:30.336,Look at them.
00:35:30.545,00:35:32.922,I just want you to look at their faces.
00:35:33.131,00:35:36.259,A few of the victims you've left in your wake.
00:35:37.677,00:35:39.011,Tell me...
00:35:39.929,00:35:44.475,have you ever felt the swift vengeance of justice?
00:35:48.855,00:35:51.232,Give me your cousin...
00:35:51.315,00:35:54.986,or I'll let these men show you that vengeance with their fists.
00:36:08.249,00:36:12.420,"Do it, then... you sons of bitches."
00:36:12.628,00:36:14.213,"OK, then."
00:36:16.841,00:36:21.846,We'll see how you feel... after ten minutes.
00:36:23.139,00:36:24.515,Do it.
00:36:50.791,00:36:53.252,Tell me where your cousin is.
00:36:54.170,00:36:56.839,It doesn't have to end like this.
00:37:16.901,00:37:19.111,Tell me where your cousin is.
00:37:25.451,00:37:26.869,We...
00:37:27.828,00:37:32.917,"are bandits... not snitches, motherfucker."
00:37:54.188,00:37:56.983,"You're all dead, motherfuckers!"
00:37:57.066,00:37:59.694,"You're all dead, motherfuckers!"
00:38:05.825,00:38:07.034,You're all dead!
00:38:10.913,00:38:14.041,Dump his body on the road to Sabaneta.
00:38:14.125,00:38:16.752,"Colonel, they're going to make us pay for this."
00:38:18.170,00:38:23.009,Report his death as a result of a shoot-out with the police.
00:38:23.092,00:38:25.761,Make sure you report that he fired first.
00:38:25.970,00:38:27.930,"But Colonel, he's all beat up."
00:38:34.729,00:38:36.605,That work for you?
00:38:47.783,00:38:54.582,There is nothing... more beautiful and more important in my life than this.
00:38:56.042,00:38:59.754,We're all here together... united.
00:39:02.548,00:39:06.469,Now let's eat and enjoy this marvelous food.
00:39:08.262,00:39:12.391,"- Wait, wait. - Oh, yeah, the beets."
00:39:16.437,00:39:19.190,"Hello, son. Have a seat."
00:39:19.273,00:39:22.234,"- Sit down-- - Boss, I don't know how to say this."
00:39:25.029,00:39:26.572,Tell me like a man.
00:39:27.740,00:39:29.742,- Gustavo is dead. - What?
00:39:40.252,00:39:43.255,"No, no! How dare you come to my house saying that!"
00:39:43.464,00:39:46.467,How dare you! Leave! Get out of my house!
00:39:50.346,00:39:53.933,"No! Gustavo, no. Pablo... Go on! Get out of here!"
00:40:08.823,00:40:10.825,Are you sure about this?
00:40:17.456,00:40:19.959,I want you to take him to the funeral home...
00:40:22.086,00:40:25.131,and guard his body the entire time until it's buried.
00:40:26.257,00:40:27.925,- All right. - Go on.
00:40:39.353,00:40:41.313,"How are you doing, son?"
00:41:18.392,00:41:20.895,"I'm going to miss him so much, Mama."
00:41:26.108,00:41:27.526,When...
00:41:29.737,00:41:36.744,you were nine... or ten... do you remember?
00:41:36.827,00:41:40.956,How you would ride around on your bicycles.
00:41:44.585,00:41:48.172,You'd go up into the mountains and just disappear.
00:41:48.255,00:41:52.092,The whole day would go by...
00:41:54.345,00:41:55.846,"Oh, my."
00:41:56.764,00:41:58.933,And we would call you...
00:42:00.184,00:42:05.064,"We seemed crazy, yelling for you all over the place..."
00:42:07.858,00:42:10.736,until finally you would appear.
00:42:12.154,00:42:14.156,"Oh, my God."
00:42:15.157,00:42:17.368,Where were you?
00:42:18.202,00:42:21.664,"Where have you been, son? I would yell out."
00:42:23.165,00:42:25.751,"In the mountains, Mama."
00:42:26.835,00:42:33.342,"Higher than the clouds, Auntie, Gustavo would say, laughing."
00:42:40.516,00:42:42.101,He...
00:42:42.184,00:42:44.770,He always wanted to go farther.
00:42:47.815,00:42:50.150,He always did.
00:42:53.612,00:42:55.698,Only with you.
00:43:00.619,00:43:03.455,I didn't think it would end this way.
00:43:37.740,00:43:39.575,Good afternoon.
00:43:42.536,00:43:47.333,Boss? Someone came all the way out here to see you.
00:43:50.836,00:43:52.671,Miss Valeria.
00:44:06.268,00:44:09.146,"Good day, ma'am. Pablo."
00:44:10.022,00:44:11.523,What's she doing here?
00:44:11.607,00:44:14.526,I'm here only because I have important information.
00:44:14.610,00:44:16.070,I hope it's very important.
00:44:16.278,00:44:18.739,It's about Gustavo.
00:44:20.074,00:44:21.700,"Tell us, then."
00:44:21.909,00:44:26.455,I've been told the Ochoa brothers have been seen in Cali.
00:44:26.538,00:44:33.462,"They are the ones who turned Gustavo over, in exchange for the cartel helping them seal a deal with the government."
00:44:35.089,00:44:37.549,"You know me, Pablo."
00:44:38.550,00:44:40.302,I have my ways.
00:44:49.311,00:44:51.647,Who in Cali?
00:44:54.316,00:44:55.567,Pacho Herrera.
00:45:12.709,00:45:15.421,He did get 14 Cali men that day.
00:45:15.629,00:45:19.716,"The problem was, everyone on the soccer field was dressed the same."
00:45:29.768,00:45:31.520,he was already running away.
00:45:39.194,00:45:42.072,Will your wrath burn like fire?
00:45:42.156,00:45:49.663,"Remember how fleeting is my life, for what futility you have created the children of men."
00:45:55.335,00:46:00.549,"In his mind, losing his best friend was a price he had to pay to defeat extradition."
00:46:14.855,00:46:18.066,extradition was defeated by a landslide.
00:46:19.026,00:46:27.034,"Hours after the vote, a military helicopter was dispatched to coordinates just outside Medellín, where Pablo was waiting."
00:46:41.507,00:46:42.674,and the Colombian government.
00:46:42.883,00:46:47.387,This is the offer of our terms for your surrender.
00:46:50.807,00:46:58.106,"A terrorist, a drug dealer and a murderer surrendering to a grateful nation who gave him everything he asked for."
00:46:58.190,00:47:02.319,"It was the closest we'd ever come to him, and we never felt further away."
00:47:07.699,00:47:09.493,Let me hand over my gun.
00:47:13.413,00:47:16.542,- You won. - We both did.
00:47:18.043,00:47:21.004,Now Gaviria can announce that Pablo Escobar has turned himself in.
00:47:23.590,00:47:25.384,Except that's not so true.
00:47:25.467,00:47:27.719,You and I know it's a big lie.
00:47:27.928,00:47:29.555,Mm.
00:47:30.847,00:47:37.646,Lies are necessary... when the truth is too difficult to believe. Right?
00:47:43.527,00:47:46.321,Pablo wasn't succumbing to justice.
00:47:46.530,00:47:52.035,He was escaping it. And all anyone could do was watch.
00:47:57.874,00:48:02.170,"Once again, Escobar had used violence to bend the world to his will."
00:48:03.130,00:48:07.384,"They called it la gran mentira, the big lie."
00:48:07.467,00:48:09.678,And it was a lie.
00:48:11.388,00:48:15.309,Except as I watched him fly away to his luxury prison...
00:48:16.893,00:48:18.979,I couldn't help but think there was some truth in it.
00:48:21.523,00:48:24.318,A truth that I hadn't been willing to accept.
00:48:28.071,00:48:31.617,He'd beat us because he was willing to do what we weren't.
00:48:32.951,00:48:35.037,Bad guys don't play by the rules.
00:48:35.829,00:48:37.664,That's what makes 'em bad.
00:48:38.915,00:48:41.126,Maybe that's what lets 'em win.
00:48:47.758,00:48:49.718,La Dispensaria.
00:48:50.677,00:48:53.055,So who do we give this to? DEA?
00:48:53.138,00:48:56.558,- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña. - Peña's an asshole.
00:48:56.642,00:48:58.518,- I'm gonna give it to the other guy. - Sure.
00:49:02.564,00:49:07.986,"that I could strike a blow against Escobar, even if it meant breaking the rules, oh, I was gonna do it."
00:49:21.291,00:49:22.918,on these motherfuckers?
00:49:24.753,00:49:26.963,You wanna call me a bad guy?
00:49:34.304,00:49:40.018,"Fine. But if you do, it just means that you haven't met enough bad guys yet to know the difference."
00:49:41.561,00:00:58.224,"There's one thing I've learned down here in Colombia, Good morning, Paisa. What have you got for us?"
00:00:58.308,00:01:05.398,"I've got plumbing valves, a bunch of clean towels, and extra uniforms for the guards."
00:01:13.990,00:01:16.034,Let him go. He's been checked.
00:01:16.242,00:01:18.036,"Continue. Continue, Paisa."
00:01:18.244,00:01:19.829,"Thank you, Sergeant."
00:01:19.913,00:01:21.706,- Good day. - Good day.
00:01:38.056,00:01:40.850,but we nicknamed it Club Medellín.
00:01:41.684,00:01:44.020,It was the embodiment of the big lie.
00:01:44.229,00:01:47.857,It was even built to look old and shitty on the outside.
00:01:47.941,00:01:51.361,"But inside, it was anything but."
00:01:52.278,00:01:55.949,The other inmates? Escobar's sicarios.
00:01:56.032,00:01:58.785,Hand-picked killers from his hometown.
00:02:03.748,00:02:06.417,"- How you doing, Velasco? - Good, brother. How was the trip?"
00:02:06.501,00:02:08.461,"Fine, fine. What a long drive!"
00:02:08.545,00:02:10.255,- Really? - It's really hot.
00:02:10.338,00:02:11.673,Did you encounter any problems?
00:02:11.756,00:02:14.425,Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.
00:02:14.509,00:02:18.680,"I brought everything, including the special items requested by Pablo."
00:02:18.763,00:02:20.473,"- What's going on, buddy? - Blackie!"
00:02:20.557,00:02:24.185,- I thought you forgot about us. - Let me show you.
00:02:26.437,00:02:30.608,"Oh, my God. All right, boys! Get a ladder over here!"
00:02:34.821,00:02:36.406,"The guards did, too."
00:02:42.912,00:02:45.039,We'll take care of you.
00:02:52.046,00:02:56.926,no cops or military were allowed within two miles of the prison.
00:02:57.010,00:03:01.055,"As much as I fucking hated this guy, I had to hand it to him..."
00:03:16.154,00:03:19.324,Come on! Hurry up! What? Is it heavy?
00:04:04.827,00:04:07.413,He'd built himself a fortress.
00:04:07.622,00:04:11.960,But no matter how you decorate it... a cage is still a cage.
00:04:42.824,00:04:44.367,I've got a report.
00:04:44.450,00:04:49.539,"Moncada and Galeano are reporting that we got 10,000 kilos through Mexico and the Caribbean."
00:04:49.622,00:04:51.708,Did they pay the war tax?
00:04:51.791,00:04:57.463,"Yes, boss, but ever since you settled things with the government, a lot of other people have been complaining."
00:04:58.840,00:05:04.762,My expenses in and out of the prison must be covered by everyone.
00:05:04.846,00:05:06.014,Understood.
00:05:06.222,00:05:09.976,Moncada and Galeano said the Cali cartel are preparing for a ceasefire.
00:05:10.184,00:05:11.644,Mm.
00:05:12.312,00:05:14.105,As am I.
00:05:16.357,00:05:19.694,We're going to negotiate a truce.
00:05:19.777,00:05:23.656,"But first, we're going to kill a few of his men."
00:05:26.284,00:05:32.123,"I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel is going to take that as an act of war, don't you think?"
00:05:40.339,00:05:42.633,The purpose of war...
00:05:43.760,00:05:45.595,is peace.
00:05:52.101,00:05:55.104,it's that peace had finally come to Bogotá.
00:05:55.188,00:05:59.108,Connie and I took advantage and began adoption proceedings.
00:05:59.192,00:06:01.527,The war had left many orphans.
00:06:01.736,00:06:05.198,One... we could do something about.
00:06:09.285,00:06:11.829,"Oh, orchids, look!"
00:06:12.830,00:06:15.083,What's this one? Cattleya.
00:06:16.084,00:06:18.086,It means graceful. Hm.
00:06:24.258,00:06:29.055,"Oh, buying baby things and plants for the apartment..."
00:06:31.182,00:06:33.226,We're domesticated animals.
00:06:33.309,00:06:34.936,- You want this one? - Yeah.
00:06:45.113,00:06:47.031,After my mother? Are you kidding?
00:06:48.449,00:06:52.995,What is Elizabeth in Spanish? Is it Isabel? Isabel's nice.
00:06:53.204,00:06:56.499,- I've always liked Olivia. - Olivia's OK.
00:07:15.435,00:07:17.770,- Look what you did to my car! - Ah! It's nothing.
00:07:17.854,00:07:19.689,- How am I gonna drive this? - It's nothing.
00:07:19.772,00:07:21.649,Look at the fucking traffic jam this is causing.
00:07:21.732,00:07:22.567,"Yeah, man!"
00:07:30.992,00:07:35.663,"Son of a bitch. Are you gonna hit me? What the hell have you come here for, fag?"
00:07:35.872,00:07:38.332,"I deserve respect, you son of a bitch. So that's it, then."
00:07:38.416,00:07:41.127,"What, are you gonna hit me? You and who else?"
00:07:43.379,00:07:47.049,"OK, take it easy. It's all right. It's OK now."
00:07:50.136,00:07:52.054,"- Calm down, asshole. - OK?"
00:07:52.138,00:07:54.682,"- Relax, man. OK. - OK?"
00:07:54.765,00:07:56.684,"OK, calm down."
00:08:11.032,00:08:13.993,"Yeah, I like Olivia."
00:09:58.723,00:10:02.560,People. Children. Laughter.
00:10:02.768,00:10:06.063,Even the vendors are back out.
00:10:13.112,00:10:15.281,You did the right thing.
00:10:15.364,00:10:16.991,You think?
00:10:19.160,00:10:21.162,You should be happy.
00:10:22.204,00:10:25.333,"Finally, people can return to their normal lives."
00:10:25.416,00:10:28.294,Finally... we are at peace.
00:11:03.037,00:11:05.623,Is that how you guys begin negotiations?
00:11:06.582,00:11:08.042,"Two things, Pacho."
00:11:08.250,00:11:14.924,First... Mr. Galeano and I had nothing to do with those deaths.
00:11:15.007,00:11:19.345,"And the second thing... this is war, Pacho."
00:11:19.428,00:11:23.474,"There are deaths everywhere, and we have casualties as well."
00:11:27.770,00:11:38.739,"We are willing to pay three million dollars Pablo won't accept anything under $12 million, Pacho."
00:11:48.249,00:11:50.042,Do you want to know something?
00:11:50.251,00:11:52.586,It's over.
00:11:52.795,00:11:54.880,What's over?
00:12:00.845,00:12:03.848,We export twice the amount you do.
00:12:03.931,00:12:07.685,You invited me here to give me this line of bullshit?
00:12:08.644,00:12:13.732,"Pablo put a war tax on the two of you for $250,000 a month."
00:12:13.816,00:12:15.734,That's how he treats his friends and associates?
00:12:15.943,00:12:25.327,"Don't forget that, thanks to Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, extradition was abolished. That serves you very well, doesn't it?"
00:12:25.536,00:12:27.955,He was the one who got us into this mess.
00:12:28.038,00:12:32.877,"Killing politicians and cops, bombing street corners and airplanes."
00:12:33.085,00:12:36.088,He started this fucking war.
00:12:48.559,00:12:51.520,and Colonel Carrillo was transferred out of the country.
00:12:51.604,00:12:56.233,"For the time being, Carrillo's war was over."
00:12:59.236,00:13:00.696,It's not like the cocaine war is over.
00:13:00.779,00:13:02.615,Galeano and Moncada are fronting for Escobar.
00:13:04.909,00:13:06.702,My superiors say I play too rough.
00:13:08.329,00:13:12.875,At least Escobar is in jail and... you can leave knowing you helped put him there.
00:13:14.668,00:13:16.003,Jail?
00:13:17.546,00:13:20.674,"I know you gringos aren't allowed to do flyovers, but um..."
00:13:22.051,00:13:25.179,"I got some photographs, courtesy of the Colombian military."
00:13:28.474,00:13:31.644,"I want you to look at 'em, tell me if this qualifies as a jail."
00:13:38.317,00:13:40.236,Escobar is moving more coke than ever.
00:13:40.319,00:13:44.990,"Without the Colombian government breathing down his neck, all he's gotta worry about is the Cali cartel."
00:13:47.952,00:13:49.870,"Let's face it, fellas..."
00:13:51.997,00:13:54.083,he won.
00:14:07.638,00:14:09.890,Where did you learn to drive?
00:14:13.561,00:14:16.897,This takes care of the problem we had in LA and ends the war.
00:14:20.693,00:14:22.945,"Do you know what this means, boss?"
00:14:23.028,00:14:26.824,We can maintain our infrastructure and the government won't be the wiser.
00:14:26.907,00:14:32.204,"That way, we can... double our exports in less than a month, Pablo."
00:14:36.333,00:14:38.043,How did he behave...
00:14:39.044,00:14:41.088,when he offered you the money?
00:14:42.882,00:14:45.217,"What do you mean, how did he behave?"
00:14:46.302,00:14:48.053,What was his attitude?
00:14:49.054,00:14:51.390,"Well... he was respectful, Pablo."
00:14:51.599,00:14:53.309,Respectful in what way?
00:14:53.392,00:14:56.478,"- He wants peace, just like us. - Yes, but..."
00:14:56.562,00:14:59.607,how did he react when you told him our solution?
00:15:01.442,00:15:03.777,"He just offered you the money, just like that?"
00:15:05.696,00:15:10.034,Well... he started at three million dollars. Right?
00:15:12.328,00:15:13.954,and told him you wouldn't take less than 12.
00:15:14.038,00:15:18.250,"So he offered ten, and we felt that was a fair deal."
00:15:19.251,00:15:21.670,Offered you three million?
00:15:22.838,00:15:26.884,He was feeling us out. He knew we wouldn't accept that.
00:15:27.092,00:15:32.848,"If he really respected me, he would be grateful if I accepted 20."
00:15:33.599,00:15:37.478,"That's right, boss. Ask for 20. In one shot."
00:15:43.317,00:15:46.195,Tell him I'm not happy with less than 30.
00:15:47.404,00:15:49.239,"The Cali cartel won't accept that, Pablo."
00:15:49.448,00:15:53.661,Thirty million... if Cali wants peace.
00:16:18.894,00:16:20.437,Very good.
00:16:28.696,00:16:31.782,I also need to raise the war tax.
00:16:34.827,00:16:41.709,"From now on, a million a month, for both of you... and all our other partners."
00:16:50.801,00:16:53.679,"Good move beating him, you son of a bitch."
00:17:01.228,00:17:04.773,"then they have to send him to a real prison, but we need more than these aerial shots."
00:17:04.857,00:17:07.109,Can you get us satellite communications or wire intercepts?
00:17:07.192,00:17:12.072,"There's a no-fly zone over the prison, with antiaircraft guns manned by the Colombian army to enforce it."
00:17:12.156,00:17:14.074,You're playing with fire if Noonan finds out.
00:17:14.158,00:17:16.160,We don't got shit on him without intercepts.
00:17:16.243,00:17:18.245,- Don't need 'em. - What? The hell we don't.
00:17:18.328,00:17:19.997,They're not using phones.
00:17:20.956,00:17:23.292,- The hell is that? - I could spot a coop a mile away.
00:17:23.375,00:17:25.419,That's how they're sending messages.
00:17:31.550,00:17:35.429,Pablo chose the most low-tech form of communication.
00:17:35.512,00:17:37.723,Never said the guy wasn't crafty.
00:17:40.642,00:17:42.895,"- You see anything yet? - No, man."
00:17:43.854,00:17:45.856,You're blind as a bat. Give me those.
00:18:06.001,00:18:06.960,- You got it? - Yeah.
00:18:07.044,00:18:08.087,Low.
00:18:17.262,00:18:18.597,Give me the gun.
00:18:21.975,00:18:23.268,Here.
00:18:26.605,00:18:27.689,You're a shit shot.
00:18:32.611,00:18:33.821,Shoot.
00:18:34.655,00:18:35.614,Shoot!
00:18:40.494,00:18:42.079,Ever been duck huntin'?
00:18:45.791,00:18:50.295,"No, I have not been duck hunting, you... fucking hillbilly."
00:19:03.142,00:19:05.310,It's in Spanish. Read it.
00:19:14.361,00:19:17.197,The son of a bitch built a tunnel under the jail.
00:19:25.539,00:19:27.541,We agreed to...
00:19:28.667,00:19:31.253,- one million dollars. - What?
00:19:34.882,00:19:36.133,Right.
00:19:39.052,00:19:41.221,What about the house in Cartagena?
00:19:41.305,00:19:43.098,"That's not happening, right?"
00:19:43.182,00:19:45.517,Do you want your house in Cartagena?
00:19:45.601,00:19:49.271,- Of course. - OK... you will have it.
00:19:50.939,00:19:53.901,"No, I see things are getting more complicated."
00:19:59.448,00:20:00.741,Mm-hm.
00:20:03.619,00:20:06.455,Pablo doesn't want peace with Cali.
00:20:06.538,00:20:09.541,"Now, what about this war tax he's charging you?"
00:20:09.625,00:20:13.462,"$250,000 was a lot of money."
00:20:16.757,00:20:20.844,What do you think I should do? Call Pablo and tell him I won't pay it?
00:20:20.928,00:20:23.263,- Obviously not. - Then I don't understand.
00:20:23.347,00:20:28.435,"- What do you want me to do? - It's not right, Kiko, and you know it."
00:20:31.563,00:20:35.442,"Look, I... adore Pablo. I adore him."
00:20:38.487,00:20:41.740,"But the thing is, I don't know what's going on with him these days."
00:20:48.413,00:20:50.999,I don't know. Maybe he's depressed.
00:20:51.875,00:20:56.964,We're here in a Jacuzzi...
00:20:58.048,00:20:59.841,free.
00:21:04.096,00:21:06.098,- Do you love me? - Oh...
00:21:06.181,00:21:09.685,Stop fucking around. You make me angry.
00:21:18.193,00:21:20.570,- with our infrared cameras. - No tunnels.
00:21:20.654,00:21:24.491,"Tomography report indicates nothing. Seismic measuring, nada."
00:21:26.326,00:21:28.829,"Well, we could try. Doesn't penetrate deeper than 30 feet."
00:21:28.912,00:21:31.957,"If he's bringing shit into this tunnel, you can bet he's going out that way."
00:21:32.165,00:21:35.752,"If there's a tunnel there, he must have dug it to China."
00:21:36.461,00:21:37.296,Good luck.
00:21:48.932,00:21:51.893,We can ask the military to do light detection and ranging.
00:21:51.977,00:21:55.188,We got a better chance of Noonan authorizing a divining rod.
00:21:58.567,00:22:01.320,"- All right, man, I'm calling it a night. - Nah, finish up."
00:22:01.403,00:22:03.405,"No, you can't even smoke in here."
00:22:07.034,00:22:08.368,No luck?
00:22:09.202,00:22:13.206,These aerials don't indicate a single tunnel in the whole mountainside.
00:22:13.290,00:22:14.791,Hm.
00:22:14.875,00:22:18.045,"Well, the only thing I can see in all of them is this truck."
00:22:20.547,00:22:23.300,"- Are you finished with that, honey? - Yeah."
00:22:50.118,00:22:51.661,Did it stop?
00:22:53.330,00:22:54.581,Good morning.
00:22:54.664,00:22:56.333,- What's up? - Are you The Paisa?
00:22:56.416,00:22:59.336,- Yes. - Nice to meet you. Javier Peña.
00:22:59.419,00:23:02.589,Do me a favor and get out of the truck.
00:23:10.806,00:23:12.849,Up against the truck.
00:23:19.064,00:23:20.524,Let's go.
00:23:24.778,00:23:26.279,Open it up.
00:23:35.163,00:23:36.248,Go on.
00:23:47.843,00:23:54.182,"Sex toys, back issues of Hustler, a waterbed, a legal correspondence course."
00:24:01.022,00:24:03.358,Of course we have the right.
00:24:03.441,00:24:09.447,"You just press the button in the truck and we will do the rest, OK?"
00:24:09.531,00:24:14.452,"If the boss finds out that I let you put cameras in the truck, he'll kill me."
00:24:15.829,00:24:17.914,"He says if Pablo finds out, he'll kill him."
00:24:19.624,00:24:21.126,Amigo...
00:24:26.923,00:24:29.217,Yeah? Yeah.
00:24:38.935,00:24:42.522,I am your boss. Yes?
00:24:42.606,00:24:45.192,"It's OK, it's OK! I'll do whatever you say."
00:24:45.275,00:24:46.610,Yeah?
00:24:53.283,00:24:55.535,"Are you OK, friend?"
00:25:44.626,00:25:47.629,- Club Medellín. - This was all shipped in to La Catedral.
00:25:47.712,00:25:51.007,"We got some big-screen TVs, nice stereo equipment."
00:25:51.216,00:25:54.261,"That's a roulette wheel, a little bit of liquor."
00:25:54.344,00:25:58.056,Glad to see the judges could come down with the official from the airport.
00:26:01.893,00:26:04.062,Don't forget the jukebox with the hookers.
00:26:04.271,00:26:06.314,"Of course, the lobster."
00:26:14.239,00:26:17.325,He has a casino right there at La Catedral.
00:26:18.326,00:26:22.247,- Where did you get these pictures? - From the DEA.
00:26:22.330,00:26:24.165,Of course.
00:26:24.249,00:26:26.167,It's not just these pictures.
00:26:36.303,00:26:39.806,"- Who else has seen these? - No one, as far as I know."
00:26:44.269,00:26:48.273,Do you think the DEA is capable of leaking the photos to the media?
00:26:48.356,00:26:53.111,The DEA is capable of anything. That's why we have to do something now.
00:26:56.239,00:27:00.618,"At one time, Escobar... used to own all of Colombia."
00:27:02.078,00:27:04.706,Now he's just the owner of his own prison.
00:27:06.624,00:27:11.046,If I had to choose between prostitutes at La Catedral...
00:27:11.921,00:27:13.715,or bombings in the country...
00:27:19.596,00:27:22.807,I would be eternally grateful to these women.
00:27:40.742,00:27:44.245,"- Happy birthday. - Hello, sweetheart."
00:28:11.022,00:28:15.193,"They are really good, Blackie. I like them."
00:28:15.276,00:28:20.407,"Come on, Pablo, tell us... what are you doing these days? Hm!"
00:28:20.490,00:28:23.410,- How do you spend your time? - Aside from missing his family?
00:28:23.618,00:28:24.953,Oh! Of course.
00:28:26.246,00:28:28.748,- He's writing a book. - Mm!
00:28:28.832,00:28:30.834,- Mother. - What?
00:28:31.042,00:28:34.421,Isn't it true? You are writing a book.
00:28:34.629,00:28:36.506,"Please, Mom."
00:28:36.714,00:28:38.258,"Well, then, you tell them."
00:28:47.058,00:28:51.187,"- Clippings. It's a book of cartoons. - Oh, cartoons!"
00:28:51.271,00:28:53.940,From newspapers and magazines all over the world.
00:28:54.149,00:28:56.609,And you know what? People write him every day.
00:28:59.195,00:29:02.323,You have to find ways to keep your mind occupied around here.
00:29:02.532,00:29:07.036,"Yes, my love. And you have Judy's husband and Galeano to help you with the business."
00:29:07.120,00:29:12.792,"Yes, on that note, Kiko is so grateful to you for all the responsibilities you have given him."
00:29:12.876,00:29:14.377,Thank you very much.
00:29:16.296,00:29:18.590,"- We were in Cartagena last week. - Oh, yeah?"
00:29:18.798,00:29:22.010,"Oh, yes, we spent some beautiful days there relaxing."
00:29:24.179,00:29:26.347,"- How nice. - Wonderful, Tata. You can't imagine."
00:29:29.142,00:29:31.936,"Oh, it's unaffordable."
00:29:32.020,00:29:38.610,"Besides, this whole war with Cali thing, it's tough, you know, with the tax we have to pay."
00:29:38.693,00:29:42.947,"We understand it's not easy, but there's not much we can do."
00:29:43.031,00:29:44.574,It's OK.
00:29:52.415,00:29:54.125,Kiko complained about that?
00:29:56.878,00:29:58.797,He mentioned it.
00:30:02.509,00:30:05.011,"He didn't complain, Pablo, he didn't complain."
00:30:05.094,00:30:12.101,"Everyone here is absolutely aware of the huge sacrifice that you're making, for God's sake. So I think it's normal, right?"
00:30:12.310,00:30:13.937,It's normal that we'd give you our support.
00:30:14.145,00:30:17.565,"Well, I think it's normal... I really do."
00:30:22.612,00:30:25.865,"Juan Pablito, go play with your dad for a little while, OK?"
00:30:25.949,00:30:28.785,"Honey, you should play with the kids a little bit."
00:30:34.332,00:30:35.792,Leave the gift here.
00:30:36.543,00:30:37.877,I'll look after it.
00:30:59.399,00:31:03.778,"The word from Sandoval is, Gaviria isn't gonna do shit about Escobar's violations."
00:31:06.823,00:31:09.117,Carrillo was right. He won.
00:31:11.077,00:31:12.495,What are those?
00:31:13.997,00:31:17.166,"These are a list of, uh... my accomplishments."
00:31:37.937,00:31:39.564,You shred these.
00:32:20.730,00:32:21.940,Apologize!
00:32:22.148,00:32:23.566,Apologize!
00:32:23.650,00:32:25.193,Apologize!
00:32:26.319,00:32:28.947,- Were you watching? - Yes.
00:32:29.030,00:32:30.615,You apologize!
00:32:30.698,00:32:32.617,"I'm sorry, boss."
00:32:33.618,00:32:35.536,I didn't mean it.
00:32:41.584,00:32:43.169,"- Relax. - Are you all right, boss?"
00:32:43.252,00:32:45.546,Relax. That's how the game goes.
00:32:45.630,00:32:48.216,"Go on, go on. You guys continue."
00:32:57.225,00:33:00.478,"Excuse me, boss, but I need to speak to you."
00:33:00.561,00:33:01.980,Everything OK?
00:33:03.523,00:33:06.818,"- Boss, we have a problem. - What problem?"
00:33:07.026,00:33:13.533,You remember that Moncada and Galeano had a large shipment - that was seized in Boyacá? - Yes.
00:33:13.616,00:33:16.577,- 250 kilos. - Exactly.
00:33:16.661,00:33:20.957,"Can you imagine, a farmer found three million dollars buried in a field?"
00:33:21.040,00:33:22.458,"Do you know where that was, boss?"
00:33:24.043,00:33:25.503,In Rionegro.
00:33:32.885,00:33:38.141,Remember how I told you that the cartel was making so much money that they had to bury it?
00:33:38.266,00:33:40.476,And Blackbeard had the treasure map.
00:33:44.439,00:33:46.274,but not all of it.
00:33:46.357,00:33:54.991,"It just so happens that one day, out in a field in Rionegro, a farmer who worked for Galeano and Moncada found one."
00:33:55.074,00:33:57.744,"At first, the poor guy thought he'd dug up a body."
00:33:57.952,00:34:01.205,"Over the years, plenty of 'em had been buried out in the fields."
00:34:02.165,00:34:04.834,The farmer knew right away it was narco money.
00:34:04.917,00:34:08.713,He was terrified he might get buried himself if he took it.
00:34:08.921,00:34:13.926,"So he took the money to a guy who was connected, who took it to another guy..."
00:34:14.010,00:34:18.181,who took it to Pablo's sicario lieutenant... Velasco.
00:34:22.810,00:34:26.939,"The guerillas, the paramilitary, the narcos..."
00:34:27.940,00:34:30.610,"- Everybody's burying cash. - Yes, I know."
00:34:38.910,00:34:40.828,I think it's strange.
00:35:12.902,00:35:17.073,was found... in a field.
00:35:20.660,00:35:25.081,Or it could be bad luck. For you both.
00:35:30.044,00:35:34.423,"It was on your property, in Rionegro."
00:35:34.632,00:35:41.264,"But Pablo, those lands are over 300 acres, and most of us rent out to the farmers."
00:35:45.810,00:35:51.023,You told me that you had a 250-kilo shipment seized.
00:35:51.107,00:35:52.567,That's true.
00:35:52.775,00:35:54.944,The shipment equaled that amount of cash.
00:35:55.153,00:35:57.405,Who told you to open your mouth?
00:35:57.613,00:36:00.825,Not true? Hm?
00:36:01.784,00:36:05.037,"Pablo, do you think we're stealing from you?"
00:36:05.121,00:36:07.957,That we made up that whole story about the seizure?
00:36:08.040,00:36:11.002,"If you'd like, check with the cops in Boyacá."
00:36:11.085,00:36:15.464,"Right, because cops in Boyacá are so honest, right?"
00:36:17.633,00:36:20.636,Keep in mind that we bought that property from Gustavo.
00:36:20.845,00:36:26.767,I even remember Gustavo saying that you had cash stashed in every corner.
00:36:29.270,00:36:34.734,Gustavo... would never forget where he buried cash.
00:36:35.818,00:36:40.489,"Who's putting this shit in your head, Pablo? These assholes?"
00:36:48.372,00:36:52.960,Maybe that cash was lost because I raised the tax?
00:36:53.169,00:36:56.130,Bullshit. I paid the tax and never complained.
00:36:56.214,00:36:58.507,That's a lie.
00:37:00.468,00:37:04.472,- Because you complained to your wife. - I haven't complained.
00:37:04.555,00:37:07.683,You have no idea what I talk about with Judy.
00:37:10.561,00:37:12.146,What is difficult for me?
00:37:12.355,00:37:15.858,"Well, managing all of this. That's why you hired us."
00:37:15.942,00:37:18.903,- So we can manage it and look after it. - Mm.
00:37:22.031,00:37:24.492,"You trust us, right?"
00:37:26.077,00:37:30.623,"I understand this makes you anxious-- - Do I look anxious? - No, I didn't mean that."
00:37:30.831,00:37:38.756,"- You said with certainty that-- - No, no, what I meant to say was-- - I think you're the one who's anxious. - We didn't do shit, Pablo!"
00:37:40.716,00:37:46.013,With that tone of yours... you're telling me you didn't do shit?
00:37:47.598,00:37:52.103,Like I was some kind of idiot. Is this my cash or not?!
00:37:52.311,00:37:53.229,"No, Pablo."
00:37:53.312,00:37:57.233,Did you take it and bury it in Rionegro or not?!
00:37:57.441,00:37:59.277,"For sure, these guys hid your cash, boss."
00:37:59.485,00:38:08.536,"- It's the truth, you pair of liars. - Of course, he-- You shut up, motherfucker! Don't you disrespect me!"
00:38:13.040,00:38:15.209,"Pablo, look at me, man."
00:38:17.128,00:38:19.338,We're family.
00:38:20.423,00:38:24.218,You're my daughter's godfather.
00:38:24.302,00:38:27.596,And also godfather to Galeano's kids.
00:38:29.181,00:38:30.349,What's going on?
00:38:39.734,00:38:42.903,We're partners and friends.
00:38:43.112,00:38:46.073,"We've been in this our whole lives, Pablo."
00:38:46.157,00:38:49.744,We made our first trip to Miami together.
00:38:49.827,00:38:55.708,We made so much cash together that we don't even know what we spent it on.
00:38:56.792,00:38:58.794,What's the problem?
00:38:59.628,00:39:01.922,What's happening?
00:39:04.884,00:39:07.553,The two of us love you very much.
00:39:07.636,00:39:09.847,And we're very grateful.
00:39:31.702,00:39:33.245,All right.
00:39:34.914,00:39:37.666,Being stuck in here...
00:39:38.793,00:39:40.836,can make someone paranoid.
00:40:07.029,00:40:10.282,We're here for whatever you need. Trust us.
00:40:10.491,00:40:12.284,I'm going to make a trip to Miami.
00:40:12.368,00:40:15.371,"I'll bring you a few little things to keep you entertained, OK?"
00:40:18.082,00:40:19.417,Don Pablo.
00:40:49.613,00:40:52.450,"Pablo, don't do it! Pablo, no!"
00:41:24.940,00:41:29.153,What does it feel like to take a shit on your own empire?
00:41:30.488,00:41:32.907,You want us to tell you that we stole the money?
00:41:37.286,00:41:43.167,"At the end of the day, you'll believe whatever you want, motherfucker."
00:41:54.970,00:41:56.514,"Goodbye, Kiko."
00:42:04.396,00:42:06.649,Kill me with your own fucking hands!
00:42:12.696,00:42:14.740,Motherfucker!
00:42:35.135,00:42:36.387,Wait a second!
00:42:36.595,00:42:38.472,"Be careful, man."
00:42:44.937,00:42:47.565,Look what the dead guy gave me.
00:43:02.162,00:43:04.373,What the fuck! You're going to burn all the meat!
00:43:04.456,00:43:07.084,What is wrong with you? Can't you see I'm doing it to cover the smell?
00:43:07.167,00:43:11.380,"- Yeah, but let's not burn it all. - What are we gonna do with all this meat?"
00:43:11.463,00:43:14.341,- What are you going to do? - What am I supposed to do?
00:43:14.425,00:43:16.176,What?
00:43:29.064,00:43:31.233,"Boss, are you OK?"
00:43:32.818,00:43:34.820,"Do you need anything, boss?"
00:43:36.780,00:43:39.783,We're grilling some meat. Do you want some?
00:43:41.035,00:43:43.412,No. I'm not hungry.
00:44:10.898,00:44:12.358,Navegante.
00:44:13.317,00:44:14.860,Boss.
00:44:15.736,00:44:19.239,"- Do you want me to wax it? - No, relax."
00:44:19.323,00:44:22.076,This one's my favorite. I enjoy it.
00:44:22.868,00:44:25.621,This is a beautiful car.
00:44:26.497,00:44:29.166,Anything new on Galeano and Moncada?
00:44:39.343,00:44:41.095,It's a shame.
00:44:43.764,00:44:45.641,I warned them.
00:44:45.724,00:44:48.727,"As the twig is bent, so grows the tree."
00:44:55.734,00:44:58.612,Do you still have that DEA contact?
00:44:58.695,00:45:02.282,Javier Peña? Of course.
00:45:02.366,00:45:05.327,I want you to contact him and confirm the rumors.
00:45:05.536,00:45:09.081,They're just as interested in screwing Escobar as we are.
00:45:14.169,00:45:17.881,I've called everyone. I'm so worried.
00:45:17.965,00:45:21.301,Pablo told me that they left La Catedral.
00:45:21.385,00:45:23.387,"Just relax, sweetie."
00:45:24.263,00:45:25.973,Your husband is fine.
00:45:27.141,00:45:29.393,"No. No, thank you."
00:45:31.645,00:45:36.483,Maybe... they had to go somewhere else urgently?
00:45:36.692,00:45:38.444,Or maybe they left without saying anything.
00:45:38.652,00:45:40.612,The way our men usually do.
00:45:40.696,00:45:43.240,"Yes, but it's a little strange, don't you think?"
00:45:43.323,00:45:47.661,Kiko was very clear that he had a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.
00:45:47.744,00:45:49.329,He said he would be home later.
00:45:49.538,00:45:54.001,We're trying to have another baby. I think I told you that.
00:45:54.209,00:46:02.217,"No? We're trying to have another baby, and the time is right, so we had a very important date to keep."
00:46:02.301,00:46:06.430,Are you sure that Pablo told you that Kiko left La Catedral?
00:46:09.933,00:46:12.644,Are you telling me that my husband is a liar?
00:46:13.979,00:46:16.190,I want my husband back.
00:46:19.067,00:46:23.322,If Pablo told Tata that they left...
00:46:23.530,00:46:25.699,it's because they left.
00:46:26.617,00:46:31.830,Listen... Pablo is your kids' godfather.
00:46:31.914,00:46:34.291,He would never hurt them.
00:46:50.933,00:46:53.477,There are rumors that he killed Galeano and Moncada.
00:46:55.729,00:46:57.272,"Where, in jail?"
00:47:02.778,00:47:04.655,In jail.
00:47:04.738,00:47:07.741,That doesn't make any sense. They're partners.
00:47:08.742,00:47:13.872,Maybe there is not such thing as sense with Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
00:47:13.956,00:47:17.501,Bullshit. Where'd you get it?
00:47:18.502,00:47:22.839,The relatives of the men he killed... are up in arms.
00:47:23.048,00:47:27.302,"The poor fellows went in, but they never got out."
00:47:30.305,00:47:33.767,I want to ask you gentlemen a serious question now.
00:47:35.227,00:47:37.563,How bad do you want Escobar?
00:47:38.647,00:47:41.483,How far are you willing to go in this matter?
00:47:41.567,00:47:43.735,What are you proposing?
00:47:43.944,00:47:49.992,"Well, we both have access to information that could benefit the other."
00:47:50.200,00:47:51.827,No.
00:47:52.619,00:47:54.079,"No, we don't trade information."
00:47:54.162,00:47:56.081,- Just hold on a second. - No.
00:47:56.164,00:47:58.250,"He's an informant, Javi."
00:47:58.333,00:48:01.295,"Whatever you got cookin', it stinks. I don't want it."
00:48:01.378,00:48:04.464,Appreciate the tip. Let's go.
00:48:09.011,00:48:11.805,Your partner here...
00:48:14.391,00:48:16.727,may need some convincing now.
00:48:20.355,00:48:26.028,"Moncada and Galeano going into La Catedral, last stamped 9:20."
00:48:33.785,00:48:35.912,"no Moncada, no Galeano."
00:48:47.466,00:48:50.886,It meant more chaos and confusion in the Medellín cartel.
00:48:51.762,00:48:58.644,"But we wanted Escobar out of that piece of shit excuse for a jail, in a real prison, not a fortress..."
00:48:58.727,00:49:01.146,where his enemies could get payback.
00:49:02.397,00:49:03.940,You sure?
00:49:04.024,00:49:07.903,We can either play politics or we can do the job.
00:49:25.629,00:49:27.297,"And believe me, I'm going to."
00:49:45.273,00:49:47.234,- Be right back. - Gracias.
00:49:51.947,00:49:53.865,Fuck President Gaviria.
00:49:54.074,00:49:55.784,Fuck Noonan.
00:49:55.992,00:49:58.036,Fuck La Catedral.
00:00:22.313,00:00:31.489,"of the prisoners at La Catedral, the police began an investigation into the supposed capital crimes being committed by Pablo Escobar within the prison walls."
00:00:42.792,00:00:44.294,It's from upstairs.
00:00:45.003,00:00:46.546,"Oh, I get a card."
00:00:53.845,00:00:57.057,"This is, uh... this is blowing up a little bit more than we expected, no?"
00:00:57.140,00:00:58.975,"Well, hopefully, the son of a bitch rots in jail."
00:00:59.059,00:01:01.561,Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We gotta transfer him first.
00:01:04.355,00:01:06.816,- Escobar has a lot of enemies. - 'Course it was you.
00:01:07.025,00:01:09.569,"Whoever did this, it doesn't really matter now. What's done is done."
00:01:13.573,00:01:16.367,I'm filing a report with the Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.
00:01:18.578,00:01:23.833,"'Cause if something isn't done, every American down here associated with the government is gonna look like a fool, including you."
00:01:23.917,00:01:27.837,"I wasn't finished. Until further notice, you're both suspended."
00:01:28.046,00:01:29.464,Go home.
00:01:31.925,00:01:33.551,MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?
00:01:38.014,00:01:42.769,Moncada's wife reported his disappearance from La Catedral.
00:01:42.852,00:01:46.231,It's clear that Escobar killed those men in that prison.
00:01:47.732,00:01:51.945,- I don't think he'd take it that far. - Escobar is capable of anything.
00:01:52.028,00:01:55.031,But you know what? This could be a good opportunity for us.
00:01:55.115,00:01:56.366,"Forgive me, Eduardo..."
00:01:57.325,00:02:01.287,but I'm having a hard time finding the silver lining in all this.
00:02:02.831,00:02:06.334,This is our opportunity to end Pablo's vacation.
00:04:46.202,00:04:47.495,Ahh!
00:04:58.006,00:04:59.215,"Good morning, boss."
00:05:01.759,00:05:03.136,Bad news.
00:05:21.946,00:05:24.032,Have the bodies disappeared?
00:05:39.255,00:05:43.760,"Excuse me, but killing people in prison is a direct violation of our agreement."
00:05:43.843,00:05:45.887,"Yes, yes, but we have to tread carefully."
00:05:46.095,00:05:52.143,"If he feels we're violating his terms, he'll start putting bombs on street corners again."
00:05:52.351,00:05:59.317,Let's tell him we've uncovered threats against him from his biggest enemies.
00:05:59.400,00:06:05.364,That would give us the opportunity to bring him to Bogotá while we improve security at La Catedral.
00:06:09.452,00:06:14.415,"The fourth brigade, commanded by General Ariza, would be the best choice to carry out this operation."
00:06:14.624,00:06:16.584,"- Ariza? - Yes, sir."
00:06:16.667,00:06:19.462,"- Is he from Medellín? - Yes, sir."
00:06:19.545,00:06:20.588,Hm.
00:06:24.842,00:06:27.220,Can we trust him?
00:06:27.428,00:06:29.138,"Yes, sir."
00:06:33.059,00:06:36.979,"Sure, it cost me a suspension, but who cares?"
00:06:37.814,00:06:40.274,I just call it a week's paternity leave.
00:06:40.358,00:06:44.946,I was ready to crack a beer and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.
00:06:45.029,00:06:50.952,"See, because of me and Peña, the Colombian government was sending in the army."
00:06:51.035,00:06:53.579,"Not the cops, but the fucking army."
00:06:58.918,00:07:02.171,"But, then again, in Colombia..."
00:07:02.255,00:07:04.966,nothing goes down the way you think it will.
00:07:45.173,00:07:48.259,"Don Pablo, here... Tata's on the phone."
00:07:52.972,00:07:58.519,I was just thinking there's nothing in the world I'd love more than to hear my wife's lovely voice.
00:07:58.728,00:08:00.938,"Pablo, what's happening?"
00:08:03.649,00:08:04.817,The soldiers.
00:08:05.735,00:08:07.028,Soldiers?
00:08:07.111,00:08:11.115,Lots of them. Headed to the prison right now.
00:08:11.199,00:08:12.742,"I don't know, Pablo."
00:08:14.452,00:08:16.370,Tell me what's happening.
00:08:17.622,00:08:20.166,"No, my love, it's nothing."
00:08:20.249,00:08:21.918,Everything is cool.
00:08:25.713,00:08:27.798,"I'll call back soon, all right?"
00:08:29.926,00:08:31.844,"I love you, baby."
00:08:33.971,00:08:35.473,"Yes, my love."
00:08:49.195,00:08:50.863,Get out the weapons.
00:09:21.519,00:09:22.687,"Listen up, company!"
00:09:22.853,00:09:27.358,You will be under the command of Lieutenant Dominguez.
00:09:28.734,00:09:30.778,Let's secure the perimeter.
00:09:30.861,00:09:39.579,Tell your men they have orders to shoot anyone Dismissed.
00:09:41.914,00:09:45.001,"- Juan Pablo, where are you going? - I'm going to the jail to help Dad."
00:09:45.084,00:09:47.628,"- No, dear, you can't go there now. - I said I want to go!"
00:09:47.712,00:09:54.427,"- Juan Pablo, your father's fine. - He needs you to stay here to look after your sister. Isn't that what he always says?"
00:09:54.635,00:09:58.347,- But the soldiers are going to kill him. - Don't ever say that in this house!
00:09:58.556,00:10:00.349,- They're going to kill him! - Quiet!
00:10:09.900,00:10:11.152,the keys still in the ignition.
00:10:11.235,00:10:14.113,- I've called his phone 20 times. - Did you call embassy security?
00:10:17.199,00:10:18.326,What? Why not?
00:10:19.327,00:10:23.331,Nothing. I just... I don't wanna ring any alarms before I check things out.
00:10:23.414,00:10:25.916,- What are you guys up to? - Connie...
00:10:27.043,00:10:29.211,"Just try to relax, OK? I'm sure everything's fine."
00:10:52.360,00:10:57.156,they're gonna try to take you out of here and look for evidence on Moncada and Galeano.
00:10:57.239,00:10:59.784,"If I leave this place, someone will kill me."
00:11:01.118,00:11:05.414,Or the Americans will use their power to restore extradition and send me to the US.
00:11:08.751,00:11:11.379,"What the fuck, let's give those bastards lead."
00:11:11.462,00:11:14.048,"- Are you crazy? - Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo."
00:11:14.131,00:11:15.925,"For every one of our men, they have 20!"
00:11:16.133,00:11:19.011,- Let's do it now. - Don't be an idiot. Wait for the boss!
00:11:19.095,00:11:21.806,Stop bickering in front of the boss.
00:11:22.014,00:11:24.225,We have the escape routes.
00:11:24.433,00:11:27.770,We could get into the hills before they even know we're gone.
00:11:35.403,00:11:37.571,There is a time to fight...
00:11:38.823,00:11:40.950,and there is a time to be clever.
00:11:41.826,00:11:43.494,"Yes, sir."
00:11:45.121,00:11:48.874,- What's your plan? - Let's talk to Gaviria.
00:11:48.958,00:11:50.501,Be smart.
00:11:51.460,00:11:54.630,Try to settle this matter peacefully.
00:11:57.633,00:11:59.343,If that fails?
00:12:12.189,00:12:15.568,Son of a bitch. These Colombians are knee-deep in a shit storm.
00:12:15.651,00:12:17.069,We gotta talk.
00:12:18.446,00:12:19.738,Back here.
00:12:22.575,00:12:24.452,What? You get a hooker pregnant?
00:12:24.535,00:12:26.620,I think Agent Murphy got snatched.
00:12:26.704,00:12:29.123,"I checked all area hospitals, police stations."
00:12:29.206,00:12:30.791,We were pursuing leads on the Cali cartel.
00:12:30.875,00:12:32.751,"It could be related to that, or it could be Escobar."
00:12:32.835,00:12:34.712,Did you report it to the Regional Security Office?
00:12:34.795,00:12:38.632,"If I tell the ROS, it becomes a five-alarm fire, and whoever has him might panic."
00:12:38.716,00:12:41.844,"If it is Escobar, he's dead already."
00:12:41.927,00:12:45.723,"Well, can you check your sources? See what comes up?"
00:12:47.349,00:12:49.101,Jesus Christ.
00:12:49.935,00:12:51.604,Let me see what I can do.
00:12:58.402,00:13:02.531,I want you to go there and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.
00:13:06.160,00:13:12.082,You'll reiterate that this is a temporary relocation while we renovate La Catedral to make it safer for him.
00:13:12.166,00:13:14.126,We both know that's not true.
00:13:15.002,00:13:19.924,But it's what you'll tell Escobar until he's safely inside a military brig.
00:13:20.841,00:13:21.884,"Yes, Mr. President."
00:13:23.052,00:13:24.303,What's wrong?
00:13:28.057,00:13:29.850,I've got a bad feeling about this.
00:13:30.059,00:13:33.437,"Eduardo, I trust you..."
00:13:33.521,00:13:38.234,and this is too important to leave to someone I don't trust completely.
00:13:41.862,00:13:44.406,"I'm at your service, Mr. President."
00:13:44.490,00:13:46.325,You know that very well.
00:13:46.408,00:13:50.454,Nothing will make me happier than to see that asshole get the justice he deserves.
00:13:59.547,00:14:03.801,Checked my sources with the Colombian military. Nobody knows jack shit.
00:14:03.884,00:14:07.346,So no indication Escobar had anything to do with Murphy's disappearance?
00:14:07.429,00:14:08.556,It's time to sound the alarm.
00:14:09.765,00:14:12.935,"Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?"
00:14:13.894,00:14:17.439,"We call out the troops, he ends up dead like Diana Turbay."
00:14:41.839,00:14:43.966,"until further notice, understand?"
00:14:44.049,00:14:46.594,All right. What else do you have?
00:14:49.305,00:14:50.764,- I know that. - Velasco.
00:14:50.848,00:14:52.433,I'll call you back.
00:14:56.186,00:14:58.022,What's happening outside?
00:15:00.149,00:15:02.026,We don't know.
00:15:18.042,00:15:19.877,Gather the boys.
00:15:22.171,00:15:26.508,And tell the prison guards they're to fire on anyone who tries to come in.
00:15:29.595,00:15:32.598,"Boss, do you think the prison guards will follow your orders?"
00:15:33.474,00:15:36.560,They'd better. I hired them.
00:15:47.905,00:15:49.031,Mm.
00:16:15.599,00:16:18.894,Good evening. Where is General Ariza?
00:16:18.978,00:16:21.021,General!
00:16:23.315,00:16:25.150,"Good evening, General."
00:16:26.986,00:16:30.114,- Mr. Vice Minister. - How are you?
00:16:30.197,00:16:31.907,Pleasure to see you. Good evening.
00:16:31.991,00:16:36.036,- Where's Escobar? - Escobar?
00:16:36.120,00:16:38.706,"Inside the prison, obviously."
00:16:38.789,00:16:40.833,"What do you mean, he's in the prison?"
00:16:40.916,00:16:43.877,I thought you were taking him into custody when you arrived.
00:16:43.961,00:16:47.506,"I'm sorry, sir, but those were not my orders."
00:16:47.589,00:16:49.717,Then what were your orders?
00:16:49.800,00:16:55.472,"My orders were to secure the perimeter, not let anyone in or out, and wait for you."
00:16:56.390,00:16:58.600,That's not what the president believes.
00:16:58.684,00:17:02.104,He's not going to be happy to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.
00:17:07.568,00:17:12.906,I turned myself in to that punk... the vice minister of justice.
00:17:15.701,00:17:21.457,"But since there is no justice in this country, he is the vice minister of nothing."
00:17:26.128,00:17:27.755,This is good.
00:17:30.215,00:17:32.134,Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.
00:17:40.017,00:17:43.854,"General, I don't believe you understand your orders clearly."
00:17:43.937,00:17:47.816,"- But I do. - Wait a second, sir, where are you going?"
00:17:47.900,00:17:50.527,I'm going to try to make a miracle happen.
00:17:50.611,00:17:54.490,I'm going in there to convince Escobar this is a temporary transfer of location.
00:17:54.573,00:17:58.202,And I'm also going to say that I'm here to guarantee his safety.
00:17:58.285,00:18:01.497,I can't allow you to put yourself in danger.
00:18:02.372,00:18:10.422,Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough to kill the vice minister of justice right in front of the fourth brigade? For God's sake.
00:18:14.176,00:18:17.846,Make it fast. Open the door. You two are coming with me.
00:18:20.099,00:18:21.934,Didn't you hear me? Open the door! General!
00:18:24.603,00:18:25.771,Open it.
00:18:49.545,00:18:52.297,Pablo is waiting for you. Go on.
00:19:04.643,00:19:06.770,"Good evening, Vice Minister."
00:19:08.230,00:19:10.232,It's been a while.
00:19:17.906,00:19:21.034,I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.
00:19:21.118,00:19:24.079,My orders are to escort you to a temporary prison in Bogotá.
00:19:24.288,00:19:29.626,The government has decided to make some improvements here at La Catedral for your safety and everyone else's here.
00:19:32.337,00:19:36.925,I would think Gaviria could come up with a more believable lie.
00:19:39.636,00:19:43.891,I know why you're here. Because of Moncada and Galeano.
00:19:43.974,00:19:46.435,But I didn't kill those men. That story is a lie.
00:19:50.731,00:19:52.357,We don't care about that. You're mistaken.
00:19:52.441,00:19:56.069,"You are betraying me, Vice Minister. Gaviria is betraying me."
00:19:56.278,00:20:01.491,"If your safety is a concern, I will gladly escort you out myself."
00:20:01.575,00:20:05.829,"We have an agreement, and you're breaking it."
00:20:06.038,00:20:10.209,What guarantee do I have that the Americans won't kidnap me and take me to the US?
00:20:11.460,00:20:17.633,"Bush would be very happy to stick me in a gringo jail, like he did to Lehder, like he did to Noriega, right?"
00:20:17.716,00:20:19.593,"That's not gonna happen, you have my word."
00:20:19.676,00:20:21.220,- Your word. - Mm.
00:20:23.805,00:20:26.558,As vice minister of justice?
00:20:27.726,00:20:31.772,Yes. I give you my word as vice minister of justice.
00:20:31.980,00:20:36.401,Haven't you noticed that the army has completely surrounded this jail?
00:20:38.362,00:20:41.365,We can end this peacefully...
00:20:41.448,00:20:44.952,if you just cooperate and walk out with me.
00:20:45.160,00:20:46.828,"Don Pablo, these bastards will kill you!"
00:20:52.334,00:20:55.420,"I respectfully decline your offer, Vice Minister."
00:20:55.629,00:21:01.718,"The press is saying I killed those men, but that's a lie to sell newspapers."
00:21:05.430,00:21:07.975,If Gaviria wants me out of here...
00:21:10.018,00:21:14.481,he can come here... and do it himself.
00:21:17.025,00:21:19.111,Meanwhile...
00:21:19.194,00:21:25.117,I'll view any incursion as a declaration of war.
00:21:39.589,00:21:42.342,I'll inform the president of your position.
00:21:46.888,00:21:48.348,Excuse me.
00:22:04.197,00:22:08.243,Why walk all that way when I have a telephone in my office?
00:22:13.290,00:22:16.543,"I'd rather call the president from outside the prison, thanks."
00:22:24.384,00:22:28.722,Surely your mother taught you never to turn down a polite invitation.
00:22:32.684,00:22:35.437,My mother taught me an invitation is optional.
00:22:35.645,00:22:39.524,I hope you'll forgive me for making this invitation mandatory.
00:22:40.776,00:22:45.363,It's not every day we're honored with the presence of a vice minister of justice.
00:22:50.118,00:22:51.620,"Come on, Vice Minister."
00:22:51.828,00:22:54.081,"Calm down, let's go."
00:23:05.425,00:23:07.344,"Sorry, I've, uh... I've been working on it."
00:23:15.018,00:23:16.728,I'm sorry.
00:23:18.688,00:23:20.273,Just trying to hold it together.
00:23:24.694,00:23:26.947,"God, I just wanna go home."
00:23:28.782,00:23:30.659,I want my husband back.
00:23:40.168,00:23:43.004,"- Do you think he's alive, Javi? - Yeah."
00:23:48.718,00:23:49.928,No.
00:23:51.680,00:23:53.598,You're just not sure he's dead.
00:24:04.192,00:24:09.531,"General, with all due respect, I don't think we should've let him go inside."
00:24:12.033,00:24:13.743,No.
00:24:13.827,00:24:17.956,I don't think Pablo is stupid enough to fuck with the vice minister.
00:24:36.850,00:24:39.227,I don't need anything.
00:24:39.311,00:24:42.022,"Look, don't be so nervous."
00:24:44.149,00:24:56.453,"As soon as you have the president on the phone, you will make it clear that if he doesn't remove the troops surrounding the prison immediately, there will be grave consequences."
00:24:59.664,00:25:05.462,"But if he withdraws the troops, we'll stay here quietly and complete our sentence."
00:25:20.560,00:25:24.272,"It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice. I need to talk to the president."
00:25:24.356,00:25:25.899,"One minute, please."
00:25:33.156,00:25:35.033,"Mr. President, excuse the interruption."
00:25:35.116,00:25:37.911,There is a call from Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.
00:25:51.174,00:25:52.175,Hello?
00:26:00.433,00:26:01.935,How long will I be here as a hostage?
00:26:16.199,00:26:19.244,Escobar has Sandoval inside the prison.
00:26:19.327,00:26:21.538,"Hang up right now, Mr. President."
00:26:24.249,00:26:25.500,"Mr. President, hang up the phone."
00:26:25.583,00:26:28.795,"If Escobar knows you're on the line, he might force you to strike a bargain."
00:26:29.004,00:26:31.506,"Or worse, if you lie to him, he might kill Eduardo."
00:26:31.715,00:26:34.175,Hang up the phone. Sir!
00:26:42.684,00:26:43.768,Leave us alone.
00:26:52.235,00:26:53.778,Shut up!
00:26:58.700,00:27:00.118,"So, then..."
00:27:01.661,00:27:05.874,the president is too busy to speak with me.
00:27:07.667,00:27:10.045,I don't understand how he ended up in that jail.
00:27:10.253,00:27:12.130,"Me, either. I don't know what Sandoval is doing."
00:27:12.339,00:27:15.300,"What did he think, that he could convince Escobar he was there to help him?"
00:27:15.383,00:27:18.845,We agreed that Ariza would have Escobar in custody.
00:27:19.054,00:27:21.639,Ariza must've had his reasons for holding off.
00:27:22.891,00:27:25.602,- Right. - This is a very delicate situation.
00:27:25.685,00:27:28.104,You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.
00:27:28.188,00:27:33.193,"Please, I suggest we call DAS to bring in a hostage negotiation team."
00:27:34.069,00:27:35.987,Do I have your permission?
00:27:39.240,00:27:40.408,Good.
00:27:45.580,00:27:48.750,"María Clara, connect me with DAS, immediately."
00:27:48.833,00:27:52.337,- No. No. - Cancel the call.
00:27:54.130,00:27:58.176,"- This time, we will not negotiate. - I don't understand, Mr. President."
00:27:59.386,00:28:01.221,If Sandoval dies...
00:28:03.098,00:28:05.725,I will have it on my conscience for the rest of my life.
00:28:05.934,00:28:09.771,"But my country comes first, and I will not empower Escobar."
00:28:09.979,00:28:15.902,"Send in the Special Forces... and finish this, once and for all."
00:28:23.034,00:28:27.705,The president didn't just betray me...
00:28:28.706,00:28:30.417,he also betrayed you.
00:28:35.296,00:28:37.132,...there would be three options.
00:28:37.215,00:28:41.678,"One: I leave with you, peacefully."
00:28:45.557,00:28:54.357,"Three: I shoot you, and then, he really would have a good excuse to kill me."
00:28:54.441,00:28:55.608,Right?
00:29:04.409,00:29:07.203,"Either way, he wins. Right?"
00:29:07.412,00:29:10.832,Maybe the president is betraying us both.
00:29:10.915,00:29:12.876,You could be right.
00:29:12.959,00:29:14.878,But you know something?
00:29:14.961,00:29:18.840,I'll sacrifice my life to make sure you're dead.
00:29:26.681,00:29:30.810,"You think you're better than me, but you're wrong."
00:29:33.938,00:29:36.357,I come from nothing.
00:29:37.358,00:29:40.904,I fought hard to become what I am.
00:29:45.533,00:29:48.328,If the government hadn't come after me...
00:29:49.496,00:29:54.209,I would be where you are now... the vice minister of justice.
00:29:56.628,00:30:00.340,You and I are nothing alike.
00:30:01.382,00:30:03.426,You are a criminal.
00:30:04.385,00:30:06.679,And criminals can't run forever.
00:30:24.405,00:30:32.080,Your friend Gaviria has ordered Special Forces to raid the prison while you're still inside.
00:30:34.123,00:30:36.125,I would have done the same thing.
00:30:59.983,00:31:01.192,Don't kill him.
00:31:02.986,00:31:09.325,If he dies... it will be at the hands of his own government.
00:31:16.332,00:31:18.209,"Good luck, Vice Minister."
00:31:53.328,00:31:55.163,"I'm sorry, Ambassador. We have a situation."
00:31:58.166,00:31:59.542,"Hey, partner."
00:32:04.172,00:32:06.257,would ever kill a DEA agent?
00:32:06.466,00:32:11.429,"Well, to be honest, after they snatched me, I'd forgotten that, myself."
00:32:11.512,00:32:19.103,"But then, I calmed down and realized that if they wanted to kill me, they would've blown my brains out right in front of my house."
00:32:24.150,00:32:31.407,"I figured this was Escobar knowing that they were coming to get him, and grabbing a get-out-of-jail-free card: me."
00:32:40.291,00:32:41.709,No. No!
00:32:41.793,00:32:46.089,They're gonna storm that bullshit fuckin' prison and blow his fuckin' head off!
00:32:58.226,00:33:02.772,"but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly, given your last meeting with Navegante."
00:33:07.318,00:33:12.448,"Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see your Cali cartel is doing so well, but you've made a huge mistake."
00:33:13.241,00:33:14.826,I don't see it that way.
00:33:16.119,00:33:21.124,"I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking the liberty of making you a cocktail."
00:33:21.207,00:33:25.336,I just learned how to do a really interesting passion fruit daiquiri.
00:33:25.545,00:33:27.964,"That's wonderful, but I don't want your fuckin' daiquiri."
00:33:28.047,00:33:31.592,You're free to leave anytime. We are a long way from Bogotá.
00:33:31.801,00:33:34.971,Fine. I'm leaving. I'll show myself out.
00:33:54.115,00:34:03.875,"Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo to ID a location where Pablo's sicarios were gathering."
00:34:04.709,00:34:06.878,"Two hours later, they were dead."
00:34:10.214,00:34:13.634,Along with an innocent woman.
00:34:23.394,00:34:24.645,OK.
00:34:29.275,00:34:31.194,at around midnight with his crew.
00:34:36.741,00:34:38.785,Who's your contact at the embassy?
00:34:38.993,00:34:41.537,Did you know she had two kids?
00:34:41.746,00:34:45.416,What do you think our newspapers will think of that?
00:34:45.500,00:34:51.714,Our government doesn't take too kindly to American-backed death squads.
00:34:52.924,00:34:55.259,I could blackmail you with these pictures.
00:34:55.343,00:35:02.683,"You'd lose your career at the DEA, go to jail... maybe here in Colombia."
00:35:04.018,00:35:05.353,But don't worry.
00:35:05.436,00:35:10.983,I won't ask you or Javier Peña to cross any line you haven't already crossed.
00:35:12.610,00:35:15.738,So you think the DEA and Cali cartel would be a good match.
00:35:15.822,00:35:21.828,"There are many, in every segment of Colombia, who have been persecuted by Pablo Escobar."
00:35:21.911,00:35:27.083,"The families of Moncada and Galeano, the families of judges and police..."
00:35:27.166,00:35:30.586,people with resources who need to be unified.
00:35:30.795,00:35:32.588,They want vengeance.
00:35:32.672,00:35:35.466,- And you'll help them get it? - With your help.
00:35:39.971,00:35:42.598,I can't make any commitments right now.
00:35:43.599,00:35:50.481,"But I can tell you this: When Pablo goes down, and he will go down..."
00:35:50.565,00:35:55.987,"you'll hear a knock at your door, and it'll be me."
00:36:02.702,00:36:05.288,You haven't tried my daiquiri.
00:36:05.496,00:36:08.040,That Herrera's a pretty good host.
00:36:08.124,00:36:12.003,"Makes a mean cocktail, gives you door-to-door service right to the embassy."
00:36:12.086,00:36:14.547,- What did Herrera say? - What'd he say?
00:36:14.630,00:36:16.048,What'd he say?
00:36:19.218,00:36:22.013,"He's got pictures on me, he's got tape on me, Javi."
00:36:26.100,00:36:27.518,Answer me.
00:36:31.355,00:36:34.567,"- Do you think I would do that to you? - Are you playing with Cali, Javi?"
00:36:34.650,00:36:37.361,That your version of all in?
00:36:37.445,00:36:41.490,I got one goal: get Escobar.
00:36:43.451,00:36:45.369,That's not an answer.
00:36:47.079,00:36:48.956,Who gave him the fucking photos?
00:36:51.292,00:36:53.044,Hey.
00:37:02.970,00:37:04.805,"See you around, Jav."
00:37:04.889,00:37:07.558,I'm gonna go call my wife.
00:37:50.434,00:37:54.605,"Look, we're having a little problem here."
00:37:54.689,00:37:59.527,"We're trying to solve it, but you know what to do..."
00:38:00.528,00:38:02.571,"if it doesn't work out, right?"
00:38:02.655,00:38:04.198,"Yes, Pablo."
00:38:05.074,00:38:06.742,I love you very much.
00:38:08.536,00:38:09.870,"Me, too."
00:38:10.871,00:38:13.499,"- Very much. - Goodbye, my love."
00:38:38.941,00:38:40.943,We are bandits.
00:39:07.970,00:39:11.557,- Wait a minute! What is this? - Your brigade is no longer in charge!
00:39:23.652,00:39:26.697,"You've gotta get me out of here, do you understand?"
00:39:26.781,00:39:28.699,"Come on, come on."
00:40:12.785,00:40:14.829,"Don't move, don't move!"
00:40:31.387,00:40:32.847,- All clear! - All clear!
00:40:32.930,00:40:34.974,- All clear! - All clear!
00:40:57.121,00:40:59.582,"- Don't move! Don't move! - It's me, it's me, it's me."
00:40:59.790,00:41:04.128,"Keep low, and no matter what happens, keep moving."
00:41:14.597,00:41:16.182,Speak.
00:41:16.265,00:41:18.267,"Yes, it's him."
00:41:18.350,00:41:20.978,"Speak up, please, I can't hear you."
00:41:21.187,00:41:22.730,Is that confirmed?
00:41:27.026,00:41:32.031,"Mr. President, they stormed the prison. Sandoval's been freed."
00:41:43.334,00:41:44.793,And Escobar?
00:41:46.295,00:41:47.796,- All clear! - All clear!
00:41:48.005,00:41:49.465,- All clear! - All clear!
00:42:02.520,00:42:04.230,Do you think he's OK?
00:42:05.439,00:42:08.609,I'm sure he's fine.
00:42:34.843,00:42:36.136,Good night.
00:42:42.268,00:42:43.978,It's OK.
00:42:45.229,00:42:47.147,Steve...
00:42:48.315,00:42:50.317,I just wanna go home.
00:43:00.369,00:43:01.996,This is home.
00:43:25.436,00:43:29.690,word had spread all over Colombia that war was coming again.
00:43:29.773,00:43:32.192,But this time would be different.
00:43:32.276,00:43:35.321,"This time, there would be no surrender..."
00:43:35.404,00:43:38.157,no negotiations...
00:43:38.240,00:43:39.908,no deals.
00:43:40.868,00:43:44.496,This time... we were gonna kill him.
00:43:48.167,00:43:53.922,"Escobar said, Better a grave in Colombia than a cell in the US."
00:43:55.299,00:43:57.926,"Well, guess what, motherfucker?"
00:43:58.010,00:44:00.179,That works for me.
