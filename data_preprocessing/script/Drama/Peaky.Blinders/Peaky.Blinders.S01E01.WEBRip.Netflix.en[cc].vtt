00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

110
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps it's a list of men
who give false hope to the poor.

147

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

149
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

161
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

168
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

182
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

183
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The last four years he's been

184
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

185
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause I asked the coppers

186
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why didn't you tell me?

187
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm telling you.

188
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why send him to Birmingham?

189
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's been all these

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

191
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now the papers are talking

192
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

193
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this copper is gonna

194
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are Irishmen in Green Lanes

195
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Catholic men who crossed him

196
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, but we ain't IRA.

197
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

198
00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

199
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they come for us,
we'll cut them a smile each.

200
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

201

202
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This family does everything open.

203
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have nothing more to say

204
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

205
00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing that's women's business.

206
00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This whole bloody enterprise

207
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
while you boys

208
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's changed?

209
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We came back.

210
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the Lord will smite the unholy

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have agents in place
across the city

536
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who will act as
my eyes and ears.

537
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I have begun to interrogate
suspects vigorously.

538
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were in Belfast.

539
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I understand you broke
a few Fenian hearts.

540
00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A rat's nest, sir.

541
00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So who do you think
stole the guns?

542
00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- The Fenians or the communists?
- If it is the IRA Fenians,

543
00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will find them
and find the guns.

544
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it is communists,
I will find them and find the guns.

545
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it is common criminals,
I will find them and find the guns.

546
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To me there is no distinction
between any of the above.

547
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah. We chose you
because you are effective,

548
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but remember this, Mr. Campbell,

549
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
this is England, not Belfast.

550
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bodies thrown in the rivers
wash up in the papers here.

551
00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We must keep the existence
of these stolen guns out of the news,

552
00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
otherwise we're simply
advertising them for sale.

553
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If there are bodies
to be buried,

554
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
dig holes,

555
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and dig them deep.

556
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want everything
accounted for,

557
00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
down to the last bullet.

558
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Thomas] Uncle Charlie, a word.

559
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are aboard.
There's no moon.

560
00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can take them out
to the turning point

561
00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
beyond Gas Street
and leave them on the bank.

562
00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They'll be found by
railway men first thing.

563
00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that agreement?

564
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I changed my mind.

565
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You what?

566
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have an alternative strategy.

567
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tell Curly to take her out
to the old tobacco wharf.

568
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a lock-up mooring
we used to keep cigarettes.

569
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He knows it.

570
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When the boat leaves your yard,
it's no longer your concern.

571
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

572
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you not seen the streets?

573
00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've sent a fucking army
to find these things.

574
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right. They've shown their hand.

575
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Their hand?

576
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they want them back this bad,
they'll have to pay.

577
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the way of the world.

578
00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fortune drops something
valuable into your lap,

579
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you don't dump it
on the bank of the Cut.

580
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're blood, Tommy.

581
00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've always looked out
for you like a dad.

582
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're going to bring holy hell
down on your head.

583
00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This copper
takes no prisoners.

584
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm told he didn't serve.

585
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Reserved occupation.

586
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it another war
you're looking for, Tommy?

587
00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The tobacco wharf.

588
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

589
00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you in position?

590
00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am, sir.

591
00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your first impressions.

592
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am quite shocked
at how these people live.

593
00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have you found anything out
that might help me?

594
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I interrogated the head
of the Peaky Blinders.

595
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He didn't know anything.

596
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A brute.

597
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It strikes me that it isn't Arthur
who heads the Shelby family.

598
00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is the younger one,

599
00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thomas.

600
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They say he won two medals
for gallantry in the war.

601
00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You sound fascinated.

602
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, my opinion
has not changed.

603
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bookmaker gangs
have other business

604
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the communists are too weak
to have planned this.

605
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I believe the guns were
taken by the IRA.

606
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You must not let your personal history

607
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
cloud your judgment.

608
00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What history?

609
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That the IRA murdered my father
will not affect my judgment.

610
00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you see any guns,

611
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
check the serial numbers
against that list.

612
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your father

613
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
was the finest officer
I ever worked with.

614
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know he'd be very,
very proud of you.

615
00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Danny, as you know,
the man you killed was Italian.

616
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And those two men over there
are his brothers.

617
00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I let the Italians
do this, Danny,

618
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they'll cut off your manhood
and let you drain.

619
00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's how those
bastards do things.

620
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, to stop a war breaking out
between us and the Italians,

621
00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and to save you
from their barbarity...

622
00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I said I would dispatch you myself.

623
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are here to witness.

624
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I died over there anyway, Tommy.

625
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I left my fucking
brains in the mud.

626
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have any last
requests, comrade?

627
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll look out for
my Rosie and my boys.

628
00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See they get apprenticeships.

629
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At the BSA factory or the Austin.

630
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they'll make foremen.
I know they will.

631
00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just ordinary.

632
00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just ordinary men.

633
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they won't get told
to do the shit,

634
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the shit, the shit
that we got told to do.

635
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whimpering]

636
00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I suppose I ought to pray now.

637
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those fucking guns,

638
00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they blew God right out of my head.

639
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that boat for me?

640
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have to get your body
out of the city, Danny.

641
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This new copper, you know...

642
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
