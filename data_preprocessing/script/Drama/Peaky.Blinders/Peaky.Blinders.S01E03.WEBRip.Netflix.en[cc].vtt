00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

178
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You went after him because he was IRA.

183
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

189
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

That's all.

230
00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

303
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some family you've got, eh?

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or we'll take your sister in

306
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She'll get four years for sedition.

307
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or you can turn him in.

308
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll say good night then, Tom.

312
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I have to find them,

313
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Polly came round.
She gave me that.

319
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, Polly must have had a rush of blood.

320
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your honesty is appreciated.

322
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, if you're not going
to use that thing...

323
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

327
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm here to talk business, Tommy.

328
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you reckon we could still do it?

329
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You loaded Ada with your bastard,
because she's a Shelby.

330
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

331
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I won't let you fuck up

333
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

334
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

335
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've loved her since she was nine

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

338
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

341
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now the coppers are saying
if we don't turn Freddie in,

342
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they'll put Ada on the arrest warrant
as well.

343
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

344
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
From now on, we do it my way.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

361
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

362
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

363
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

364
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was in a pub.

365
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's called the Mother Redcap.
An Irish pub.

366
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got talking to some old bloke
about Birmingham.

367
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said there's been trouble.

368
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said a lot,
but the only bit I heard

369
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
was that their high command think
it's the Peaky Blinders who shot him.

370
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I came up on the next boat to warn you.

371
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

372
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

373
00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

374
00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

375
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

376
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tell them there's been a misunderstanding
and we don't want any trouble.

377
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got enough trouble.
Right, Tommy?

378
00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

379
00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

380
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

381
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

382
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They gave us the worst job, Tommy.

383
00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

384
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we fucking volunteered.

385
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sometimes it lasts all night.

386
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I lie here
and I listen to the shovels,

387
00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the picks against that wall there.

388
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I pray the sun will come up
at the curtains before they break through.

389
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I don't pray.

390
00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope.

391
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And sometimes it happens.

392
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

399

400
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

401
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's all right, but in her condition
she needs peace.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

420
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's good with motors

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

425
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They control the law

With all the strikes and troubles,
you can't really depend on the police.

533
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyway, we're more honest.

534
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like you two
are making a deal.

535
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are making progress.

536
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then let me throw
a small condition into the mix.

537
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, listen, we're going
to go for dinner at Kimber's house.

538
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He has a place
a couple of miles away.

539
00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have some business
to settle first with his accountant,

540
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so, you go on ahead with Kimber.

541
00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just me and him?

542
00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Till I'm done here.

543
00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that all right?

544
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, I'll throw in an extra three quid
for your extra time.

545
00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think I'm a whore?

546
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone's a whore, Grace.

547
00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We just sell different parts
of ourselves.

548
00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You said you wanted to work for me.
To do that you have to sharpen up.

549
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The deal is I give him
two hours with you.

550
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He thinks he's a ladies' man.
He thinks he can seduce you.

551
00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whenever you want,
just kick him in the balls.

552
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a clause in a contract.

553
00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you want to be part of my organization,
you have to make sacrifices.

554
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do we have a deal?

555
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As a sweetener
you can try your luck with mine.

556
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, we have a deal.

557
00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- Two hours?
- Yeah.

558
00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Side bet. Ten pounds says
I have her fucked in one.

559
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mademoiselle.

560
00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bet he said you could
have me, didn't he?

561
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
While he has her.

562
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the arrangement, isn't it?

563
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, yours might be
a prostitute but I'm not.

564
00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was a milliner when I met him.

565
00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was independent.

566
00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I made this hat.

567
00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was a good milliner.

568
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a very pretty hat.

569
00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really is.

570
00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So is she a prostitute?

571
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
God's honest truth?
I don't know what she is.

572
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You showed me up
back there at the races.

573
00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why don't you teach me
how to dance properly?

574
00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This music is too slow.
Put on a Charleston.

575
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, then we'd be far away.
I want to dance like this.

576
00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on. You weren't so stiff
back there, were you?

577
00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You ever been in a house this big?

578
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm?

579
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at you.

580
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You look like a bloody film star.

581
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want a cigarette.

582
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, look, I've dropped something.
Pick it up.

583
00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- Pick it up yourself.
- You're a fucking barmaid.

584
00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I drop a glass on the floor,
you pick it up.

585
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to watch you pick it up.

586
00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, you little slag.
I have tried to be nice.

587
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I drop a glass on the floor,

588
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you bend over and fucking pick up
the fucking glass. Okay?

589
00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- What?
- No, sir, no.

590
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you doing here?
I've got another hour.

591
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just wait. Listen to me.
Just listen to me.

592
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was going to let you
go through with it,

593
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but in the end, my conscience
got the better of me.

594
00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She looks good on the outside.

595
00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But she has the clap.

596
00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Syphilis.

597
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you took a shine to her,
I thought to use her.

598
00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Somebody told me she had the syph,
I thought, "What the hell!"

599
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Call it my better nature.

600
00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's a whore.

601
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, just go
and wait in the car.

602
00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can walk on my own!

603
00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can we shake hands
and forget this ever happened?

604
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Start of the day
I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.

605
00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By the end, I was a whore with the clap.

606
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're a fucking bastard,
offering me like that.

607
00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But then you changed your mind.

608
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why did you change
your mind, Thomas?
