00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
they are all here
for Monaghan Boy.

307
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's what I like
to hear, Johnny boy.

308
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And Aunt Pol wants to see you.

309
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[inaudible]

310
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs]

311
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs]

312
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Tell me the man's name, Ada.

313
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Rudolf Valentino.

314
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Get out!

315
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All of you! Go on! Now!

316
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I said, tell me his fucking name.

317
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Freddie fucking Thorne!

318
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:40.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah. Your best mate since school.
The man who saved your life in France!

319
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:45.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So go on! Go on, cut him!
Cut him up and chuck him in the Cut!

320
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oye, I'm a Shelby, too, you know.
Put my fucking film back on!

321
00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So Monaghan Boy finally lost.

322
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Third time unlucky.

323
00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We took money
from all over the city.

324
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, but you'll pay it back
to people around here.

325
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Buy your popularity back.

326
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Already done.

327
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Taught you well.

328
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you fixed this race without
the permission of Billy Kimber?

329
00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Obviously, didn't teach you
well enough.

330
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Rule one. You don't punch
above your weight.

331
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Billy Kimber is there for the taking.
- Says who?

332
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Says Tommy
and his parliament of one?

333
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I ran this business
for five years...

334
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, while I was
away fighting, remember?

335
00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I learnt some things, such as, you strike
when your enemy is weak.

336
00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I thought you came here
to talk family business.

337
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll deal with it.

338
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- You're too busy taking over the world.
- Polly.

339
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If it's about Ada,
I need to know.

340
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ada wants you to give Freddie this letter.

341
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She wants Freddie to know
she's having his baby.

342
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He deserves an opportunity
to do the right thing.

343
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I say we give them a chance.

344
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
For a woman who's had
a hard life with men,

345
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you're still full of romance, eh?

346
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What do you think
Freddie sees in our Ada?

347
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- That's Freddie's business.
- No.

348
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No. I'll tell you what he sees.

349
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He sees machine guns and rifles,

350
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and ammunition
and some glorious revolution.

351
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What is it you really
don't like about Freddie?

352
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She'll have no life
with a man on the run.

353
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you can't see that,
you can't see much.

354
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Damn them for what they
did to you in France!

355
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Tell Ada, Freddie went to America.

356
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or Russia.

357
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Polly, it would do no good for Ada
to bring a baby into the world alone.

358
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Pol, listen.

359
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The truth is you would have
hit me with that thing,

360
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
if it weren't for the fact
that you know I'm right!

361
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I thought I heard
someone knocking.

362
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Couldn't get back to sleep.

363
00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Polly] The longer you leave it,
the worse it gets.

364
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Believe me, I know.

365
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I was 16.

366
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I didn't dare tell anyone.

367
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Polly, Freddie will come back.

368
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
In the end I did it myself.

369
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I did it to myself.

370
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I almost died.

371
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And he didn't come back.

372
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They don't.
Why should they?

373
00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know the words.

374
00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
"You're a whore,
the baby's a bastard."

375
00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But there's no word for the man
who doesn't come back.

376
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
One day, on your wedding day,

377
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you'll have a good man on your arm,

378
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and you will say,
"Polly, thank you for common sense."

379
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This woman is in Cardiff.

380
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We'll take the train tomorrow.

381
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Go to the castle
afterwards for a treat.

382
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:17.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I chose this place because it is outside
both of our jurisdictions.

383
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Do you want tea?

384
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Inspector, I responded
to your invitation,

385
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because I want us to
understand each other.

386
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I am a businessman.

387
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I want to make
my business successful.

388
00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I want my city run peacefully.

389
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If the city is peaceful,
business can thrive.

390
00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So we are on the same side?

391
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I think perhaps we could be.

392
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now...

393
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
How can we be on the same side
when I see things like this?

394
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:12.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My men found this
in the bedroom of a known communist.

395
00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It has your sister's name on it.

396
00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It was obvious she had been
sleeping in his bed.

397
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Are you also in bed
with the communists, Mr. Shelby?

398
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I do not share their fantasy.

399
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And as for my sister,

400
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have already dealt
with the situation.

401
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Freddie Thorne is
at the very top of my list.

402
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Cross him off.

403
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He won't be returning to the city.

404
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I will make him part of our deal.

405
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What deal?

406
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You and your Specials will leave
my businesses alone from now on.

407
00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No more raids into our territory,
no more smashing up pubs,

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

You said you wanted men

You've got three of them.

I'd never heard of you.
Then I did hear of you.

Some little Diddicoy razor gang.
I thought to myself, "So, what?"

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:32.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But then you fuck me over.
So now you have my undivided attention.

By the way, which one am I talking to?
Who's the boss?

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I'm the oldest.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Are you laughing at my brother?

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Right, he's the oldest,
you're the thickest.

626
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:52.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm told the boss is called Tommy

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:55.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

There were suspicious

He won by a length twice

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

And I'm the fucking boss.
Okay, right, end of parley.

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You fixed a race
without my permission.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

You fixed one of them so I'm going
to have you shot against a post.

643

You are also at war with the Lees,
Mr. Kimber, am I right?

The Lees are attacking your bookies

Your men can't control them.
You need help.

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Perhaps we should listen
to what Mr. Shelby has to say.

651
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Before we make our decisions.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Right. The Lees are doing
a lot of talking at the fairs.

They're saying
the race tracks are easy meat,

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because the police

Now, we have connections.
We know how they operate.

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:34.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Together, we can beat them.
Divided, maybe not.

659
00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:40.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mr. Kimber, perhaps we should
take some time for reflection,

660
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
possibly make arrangements
for a second meeting.

I admire you, Mr. Kimber.

You started with nothing,
and built a legitimate business.

663
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:56.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It would be an honor
to work with you, Mr. Kimber.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:02.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Nobody works with me.
People work for me.

Pick it up, pikey.

with the Lees on purpose.
