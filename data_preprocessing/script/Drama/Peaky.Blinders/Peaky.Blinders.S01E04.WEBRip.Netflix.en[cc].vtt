58
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

73
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

74
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It would be the finish of me.
That's for sure.

212
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When my business with Kimber is done,
the guns will be returned.

213
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- That was the deal.
- Then I am in your hands. Completely.

214
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You hold all the cards.

215
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I hope to God,
that my dismissal doesn't come

216
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
before your decision
to hand back those guns.

217
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I say this for your sake.

218
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because, if I were to be fired
and it were your fault,

219
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would do things
that would shame the devil.

220
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

221
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My fury is a thing to behold.

222
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On my last day in power for example,
I would see to it

223
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that you and your scum brothers
have your heads,

224
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
stoved in with mallets and spades.

225
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And your sister too.

226
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The baby inside her would
be of no consequence to me.

227
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only one to be spared would be
your little brother, Finn.

228
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He would however be
lifted as a juvenile,

229
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and dumped into that
part of the adult prison,

230
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where men have the most appetite
for boys like him.

231
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That would be a dark day indeed,
Mr. Shelby.

232
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If my dismissal comes
before your decision.

233
00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you understand?

234
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Know this...

235
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The clock is ticking.

236
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stanley, it's the police.

237
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stanley, get here.

238
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stanley] You bastards!

239
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stanley screaming]

240
00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look what we found.

241
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stanley Chapman does have snow
on his boots.

242
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Chapman...

243
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are fucked!

244
00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[door opens]

245
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Moss] He still refuses
to say where it came from.

246
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure with a little persuasion,
he'll tell us everything he knows.

247
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Including the whereabouts
of Freddie Thorne.

248
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- Sir?
- Your face is a picture.

249
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought you had done a deal.

250
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- Is that what you thought?
- You gave your word.

251
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My word?

252
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do people still talk about such things
in this idiotic century?

253
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My word to whom?

254
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To a Peaky Blinder?

255
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, interrogate Mr. Chapman
until he tells us,

256
00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where we can find Freddie Thorne
and his wife.

257
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The source of the money
is of secondary importance.

258
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think my campaign against Shelby
has become personal?

259
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Correct.

260
00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Spot on', as they
say in London society.

261
00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, go and interrogate Mr Chapman,

262
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and do not make the mistake of
being too gentle.

263
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, sir.

264
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[door opens]

265
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[door closes]

266
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Today's her birthday.

267
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know you never miss it.

268
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I'm lucky you're not a copper.

269
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- What do you want?
- I came to warn you.

270
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They lifted Stanley Chapman.

271
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How do you know?
The police don't spill that information.

272
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was me and Tommy who tipped them off.

273
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In return for safe passage
for you and Ada,

274
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tommy gave them Stanley and the money.

275
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Money? What money?

276
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- Who told you about the money?
- Who do you think?

277
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was Ada's idea.
That's how desperate she is

278
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to get out of that rat hole you're in.

279
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She didn't want to be here
when you found out.

280
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes the women have to take over.
Like in the war.

281
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You fucking Shelbys--

282
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't swear over your mother's grave.

283
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You play your tune and expect
the whole world to dance to it.

284
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't have time for this.

285
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did a deal? For me?

286
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't flatter yourself. For Ada.

287
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you think this copper
will keep his word.

288
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If he doesn't, Chapman will give you up.

289
00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll still have to leave town.
Same result.

290
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- So neat.
- So leave.

291
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Except there's one thing
that you got wrong.

292
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He won't be able to give up my address.
He doesn't know it.

293
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's how it works.

294
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
None of us know each
other's addresses.

295
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you wasted your fucking time.

296
00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They'll keep beating him and beating him
for information he doesn't have.

297
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So all you've done is sign
the death warrant of a good man.

298
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you won't leave.

299
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No! I won't fucking leave!
If you want me out of Birmingham,

300
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it'll have to be in a wooden box.

301
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You lay a hand on our Ada,
I'll put you in a wooden box myself.

302
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You raised a stubborn one there, Irene.

303
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Moss] You told me to carry on.
I wanted to stop.

304
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He had some kind of seizure.

305
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Campbell sighs]
So you killed him.

306
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did he give you an address?

307
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

308
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's the matter with you?
He fell down some stairs.

309
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is not bloody Belfast!

310
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not yet! But if men like him get
their way, it soon will be.

311
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So find some stairs, throw him down,
and call the coroner.

312
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Use Grayson.

313
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he has any awkward questions,
ask about the welfare

314
00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of his mistress in Salteley.
That will shut him up.

315
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kimber] To think I used to
live in a shit hole like this.

316
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A very important detail about
my reasons for employing you.

426
00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You disappoint me.

427
00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you resign?

428
00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

429
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My appetite for the work
has only increased.

430
00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tomorrow I'll show you around.

432
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, Lizzie.

433
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That bag looks heavy, jump in.

434
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- Kids' teas.
- You like kids?

435
00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- Yeah.
- Good. John's got four of them.

436
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not going to try to talk
you out of it.

437
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[engine stops]

438
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just want to talk.

439
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not against us?

440
00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
John's his own man.

441
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you are your own woman.

442
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, Lizzie, since I came back
from France,

443
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've come to you on many occasions.

444
00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- Tommy, you didn't tell him.
- No, I didn't tell him.

445
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just like you didn't tell him.

446
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now why didn't you tell him, Lizzie?

447
00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why didn't you tell him that
you'd been serving his brother

448
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for the past two years?

449
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because the past is the past.

450
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want to lose him.
He's a good man.

451
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the answer I was hoping you'd give.
The past is the past.

452
00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You see our John says you've changed.

453
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I believe him.
And that's good.

454
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Change is good.

455
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are new times I'm told.

456
00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wish you both every happiness.

457
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I want you to see that
as my wedding gift to you.

458
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And our farewell to pleasures gone by.

459
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You mean...
One last time?

460
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One last time.
You and me.

461
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's eight bloody pounds.

462
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So where shall we go?

463
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tommy? Shall we go to my lodging?

464
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So the past is not the past.

465
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can keep the money.
Get out of the car.

466
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- Tommy, please.
- Get out of the car.

467
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love him, Tommy. Really.

468
00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really.

469
00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
John will make his own decision.

470
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he will have the facts.

471
00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your brother is ten times the man you are!

472
00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Of that I have no doubt.

473
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He is obviously not stupid.

474
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All we found was stolen
tobacco and whisky.

475
00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which you left in place.

476
00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course. I would never endanger you.

477
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are doing well, Grace.

478
00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been working on Arthur.
He is easier.

479
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- Than Thomas.
- Yes.

480
00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Less intelligent.

481
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

482
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that a word you
would use about Thomas?

483
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's your word.

484
00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He has promoted me.

485
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He wants me to be
his bookkeeper and secretary.

486
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A cutthroat gangster with a secretary.

487
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pretensions of these hoodlums
are quite breathtaking.

488
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- Are they not?
- Yes. Quite breathtaking.

489
00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He has obviously fallen
quite heavily for you.

490
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought you would be pleased.

491
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remember who you're dealing with here.

492
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A man who cuts off ears
and cuts out tongues.

493
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know what he is, Sir.

494
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The difficulty with undercover work,
Grace, is to remember what you are.

495
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I come here with good news and I get this.

496
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Grace.

497
00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tommy.

498
00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need a favor.
I want to borrow the car.

499
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to take Lizzie to the country
with the kids.

500
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're going to celebrate
getting the license.

501
00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a problem, John.

502
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll need the keys.

503
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look, John, you're my brother.

504
00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's something I have to tell you.

505
00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yesterday, on the front seat of that car,
I offered Lizzie some money.

506
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And John? She said, "Yes."

507
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now that's a fact.
You do with it what you want.

508
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Take the keys.
Take Lizzie to the country.

509
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Marry her if you want.

510
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you have to know.

511
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She said, "Yes."

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get another glass.

515
00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You make a toast?

516
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm Irish, I can make a million toasts.

517
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
May you be in heaven a full half hour
before the devil knows you're dead.

518
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are we celebrating?

521
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't like that word 'limited'.

522
00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To be respectable, you have to be limited.

523
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what worries me.

524
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had the phone put in.

525
00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's in the back.

526
00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we knew someone else who had a phone,
we could call them.

527
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And since we are celebrating,

528
00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had this delivered from
Rackhams department store.

529
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aren't you going to open it?

530
00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. Save it. For a special occasion.

531
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, your first job for the company.
I want you to get that to my sister.

532
00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't see her?

533
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No one does.
She is hiding from me.

534
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am told she goes to a
bathhouse on Montague Street.

535
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On woman only days.

536
00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She goes in disguise,
so I need to get someone inside.

537
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What am I delivering?

538
00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's an invitation
to a family occasion.

539
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want her there.
So tell her there will be a truce.

540
00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Am I delivering bait for a trap?

541
00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you check that contract,
you'll find it doesn't say

542
00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
anything about asking questions.
Give her the invitation.

543
00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And put that thing
in the cupboard, until I say.

544
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[door opens]

545

546
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell, John?

547
00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I couldn't get it lit.
Couldn't even do that.

548
00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why would you want
to be smoking that?

549
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Same reason as you.
Pain in the head.

550
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I spoke to Lizzie.
I told her what you told me.

551
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She said, "Your brother is a dirty liar."

552
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then I spoke to her sister
and her cousin.

553
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bought them a couple drinks.

554
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Just a few of regulars", they said.

555
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"That's all."

556
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"To keep the wolf from the door,
she still sees a couple of regulars."

557
00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sniffs] You must think I'm an idiot.

558
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you're
the first Shelby in history,

559
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to have a legal license for anything.

560
00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

561
00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What would our granddad say, eh?
He'd be turning in his grave.

562
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Honest bloody money? Eh?
In this house? In here?"

563
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You always used to do voices
when we were kids.

564
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, we're not kids now, John.

565
00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we still have to look out
for each other, right?

566
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

567
00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Come on. Go home.

568

Get some sleep.
We've got a big day tomorrow.

569
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

570
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tomorrow we finish the war with the Lees

571
00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Be ready for anything.

574
00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

575
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Thomas] Ready boys?

576
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- John, ready?

577
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have a drink.

578
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What? Why are you all

579
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good. Let's go.

580
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

581
00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tommy, what's your plan?
We are in shotgun range.

582
00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
John, before we go into battle...

583
00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's something you're going to need.

584
00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you bloody doing, Tommy?

585

586
00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whose bloody wedding?

587
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now if we'd told you,
you wouldn't have come.

588
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a girl from the Lee family
who's going a bit wild.

589
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And she needs marrying her off.

594
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A girl who needs a husband.
A man who needs a wife.

595
00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tom, I'm not bloody marrying

596
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

597
00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

598
00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you back out now, there's gonna be
a mighty war breaking out here.

599
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gonna make the Somme...

600
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'll make the Somme look
like a tea party.

601
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if you marry her,
our family and the Lee family

602
00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
will be united forever.

603
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, it's up to you John.

604
00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
War or peace.

605
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let go of me.

606
00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

607
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should see the size of her dowry.

608
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her what?

609
00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

612
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He'll do.

615
00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[John] She'd better be under 50.

616
00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Johnny Dogs] We're here today

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...and harmony and togetherness.

621
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is sanctioned and

625
00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

626
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Grace said there's a truce.

627
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

628
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

629
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

631
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thorne in my side that's for sure.

632
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My God, Tommy.

634
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There remains one more

635
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the mingling of the two bloods.

636
00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
