00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'd fight you with my fists

Why don't you pour us both a drink?

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You saved his life the night

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's why we're drinking

384
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He laughed, a lot.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He wanted to work with horses.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Threw them in the Cut.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Not a single man

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know, after all this is over,

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
he might forgive you.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He might take you in.
You can never tell with men.

They go for whoever their dicks point at
and there's no changing their minds.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But I should tell you something.

396
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I will never forgive you,.

397
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or accept you.

398
00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or take you in.

399
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And it's me who runs business
of the heart in this family.

400
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And as far as I'm concerned,

401
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you're a snitch from the Parish.

402
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And if you're not gone
from this city by tomorrow,

403
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll kill you myself.

404
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now go.

405
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe what really upsets you,

406
00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
is the thought that
one day you might lose him.

407

Tommy. We've had word
from Nipper at Hay Mills

408
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and he says the police are
letting them through.

409
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And how come all our police

410
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because it was the police who
told Kimber about the plan.

411
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- And who told the police?

412
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
For all I think I'm the smartest one,
I'm guessing it was me.

413
00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All right, men.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You were mostly in the war so you know

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
battle plans always change
and get fucked up.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

We fight them here. Today. Alone.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now they're gonna come

420
00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They're gonna try
and break us up for good.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And we'll have no help
from the law today.

422
00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That pub there is

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well now it really is one.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And it belongs to us, right?

425
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[all] Right!

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So I reckon we're outnumbered
three to one.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
God says he don't deal
with Small Heath, sir.

You'll take the flanks.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We think a gang fight's
about to break out.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And the vehicles approaching
the city should not be impeded.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What I got was an ultimatum.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
