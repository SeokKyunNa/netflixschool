00:01:07.583,00:01:11.834,"Oh, my God. Christ!"
00:01:14.834,00:01:17.792,Shit.
00:01:23.834,00:01:26.333,"Oh, God. Oh, my God."
00:01:26.333,00:01:29.834,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
00:01:32.750,00:01:34.458,"Oh, my gosh."
00:02:03.875,00:02:06.250,"Okay. Come on, come on, come on."
00:02:06.250,00:02:08.125,Come on.
00:02:12.750,00:02:15.291,My name is Walter Hartwell White.
00:02:15.291,00:02:20.917,"I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104."
00:02:20.917,00:02:24.917,"To all law-enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt."
00:02:24.917,00:02:28.625,I am speaking to my family now.
00:02:34.750,00:02:36.834,Skyler.
00:02:36.834,00:02:39.208,You are the love of my life.
00:02:39.208,00:02:41.291,I hope you know that.
00:02:42.667,00:02:44.834,Walter Jr.
00:02:44.834,00:02:47.166,You're my big man.
00:02:47.166,00:02:56.792,There are-- There are going to be some things-- Things that you'll come to learn about me in the next few days.
00:02:56.792,00:03:05.208,I just want you to know that no matter how it may look I only had you in my heart.
00:03:11.166,00:03:13.458,Goodbye.
00:05:12.583,00:05:14.875,--money before the panel earlier.
00:05:14.875,00:05:16.667,Happy birthday.
00:05:16.667,00:05:18.834,Oh.
00:05:18.834,00:05:20.250,Look at that.
00:05:20.250,00:05:23.750,That is veggie bacon.
00:05:23.750,00:05:25.583,Believe it or not.
00:05:23.750,00:05:27.750,Zero cholesterol and you won't even taste the difference.
00:05:27.750,00:05:29.000,Mm.
00:05:29.000,00:05:30.625,What time do you think you'll be home?
00:05:30.625,00:05:32.000,Same time.
00:05:32.000,00:05:34.625,I don't want him dicking you around tonight.
00:05:34.625,00:05:38.417,"You get paid till 5, you work till 5. No later."
00:05:38.417,00:05:39.917,Ah-hah.
00:05:39.917,00:05:42.250,Hey.
00:05:42.250,00:05:44.542,"Hey, happy birthday."
00:05:44.542,00:05:46.625,You're late again.
00:05:46.625,00:05:49.333,There was no hot water again.
00:05:49.333,00:05:51.208,I have an easy fix for that.
00:05:51.208,00:05:56.041,"You wake up early, and then you get to be the first person in the shower. Hm."
00:05:56.041,00:05:57.917,WALT JR.: I have an idea.
00:05:59.750,00:06:03.375,How about buy a new hot-water heater?
00:06:03.375,00:06:08.208,How's that idea?
00:06:10.250,00:06:12.166,Did you take your echinacea?
00:06:12.166,00:06:13.375,Yeah.
00:06:13.375,00:06:15.542,I think it's getting better.
00:06:15.542,00:06:18.083,What the hell is this?
00:06:18.083,00:06:19.542,Hey.
00:06:19.542,00:06:22.625,"We're watching our cholesterol, I guess."
00:06:22.625,00:06:26.583,Not me. I want real bacon.
00:06:26.583,00:06:28.166,Too bad. Eat it.
00:06:28.166,00:06:31.875,Phew.
00:06:31.875,00:06:33.917,Eat it.
00:06:38.417,00:06:41.333,So how does it feel to be old?
00:06:41.333,00:06:43.333,How does it feel to be a smart-ass?
00:06:43.333,00:06:45.917,Heh. Good.
00:06:47.333,00:06:49.166,Eat your veggie bacon.
00:07:08.041,00:07:09.792,You're all set?
00:07:09.792,00:07:12.500,"All right, see you at home."
00:07:16.709,00:07:18.583,Chemistry.
00:07:18.583,00:07:21.417,It is the study of what?
00:07:22.667,00:07:24.125,Anyone?
00:07:25.458,00:07:26.542,Ben.
00:07:26.542,00:07:27.917,Chemicals.
00:07:27.917,00:07:29.917,Chemicals.
00:07:29.917,00:07:32.583,No.
00:07:32.583,00:07:35.041,Chemistry is...
00:07:35.041,00:07:40.542,"Well, technically, chemistry is the study of matter."
00:07:40.542,00:07:43.750,But I prefer to see it as the study of change.
00:07:43.750,00:07:46.750,"Now, just-- Just think about this."
00:07:46.750,00:07:48.375,Electrons.
00:07:48.375,00:07:52.291,They change their energy levels.
00:07:52.291,00:07:54.333,Molecules.
00:07:54.333,00:07:57.792,Molecules change their bonds.
00:07:57.792,00:08:02.709,Elements. They combine and change into compounds.
00:08:02.709,00:08:05.542,"Well, that's-- That's all of life, right?"
00:08:05.542,00:08:08.250,"I mean, it's just-- It's the constant, it's the cycle."
00:08:08.250,00:08:13.375,"It's solution, dissolution, just over and over and over."
00:08:13.375,00:08:18.458,"It is growth, then decay, then transformation."
00:08:20.834,00:08:24.375,"It is fascinating, really."
00:08:29.542,00:08:30.875,Chad.
00:08:32.709,00:08:35.041,Is there something wrong with your table?
00:08:37.250,00:08:39.625,"Okay, ionic bonds."
00:08:49.625,00:08:51.792,Are you done?
00:08:53.834,00:08:57.583,Ionic bonds. Chapter six.
00:09:08.834,00:09:11.375,"One, two, three makes 10, and 10 makes 20."
00:09:11.375,00:09:12.834,There's your receipt.
00:09:12.834,00:09:15.375,Just hand this disc to your car-wash professional.
00:09:15.375,00:09:18.208,Thank you. Come again.
00:09:28.750,00:09:32.834,He's not coming.
00:09:32.834,00:09:34.500,I'm gonna run the register.
00:09:34.500,00:09:37.417,"Bogdan, no."
00:09:37.417,00:09:40.083,"I'm short-handed, Walter."
00:09:42.875,00:09:45.875,Walter?
00:09:45.875,00:09:47.917,What am I to do?
00:10:07.583,00:10:11.000,"CHAD: Hey, Mr. White."
00:10:11.000,00:10:12.875,"Make those tires shine, huh?"
00:10:12.875,00:10:15.000,"Oh, my God."
00:10:15.000,00:10:17.875,You will not believe who's cleaning Chad's car.
00:10:17.875,00:10:19.875,Mr. White.
00:10:19.875,00:10:21.291,From chemistry.
00:10:40.750,00:10:43.208,ALL: Surprise!
00:10:43.208,00:10:45.083,"Happy birthday, Dad."
00:10:45.083,00:10:47.583,Happy birthday.
00:10:48.667,00:10:52.542,"Oh, you're so very late."
00:10:52.542,00:10:54.333,"Really, I'm serious, Skyler."
00:10:54.333,00:10:56.667,"I mean, you're flat as a washboard."
00:10:56.667,00:10:59.291,Oh.
00:10:59.291,00:11:01.500,"She's not showing at all, is she?"
00:11:01.500,00:11:04.417,She's showing a little.
00:11:04.417,00:11:07.291,"Carmen, this is my sister, Marie."
00:11:07.291,00:11:10.667,Nice to meet you.
00:11:10.667,00:11:13.667,"Glock 22, that's my daily carry, okay?"
00:11:13.667,00:11:18.500,"I mean, unless you're talking, what, Plus P Plus loads, you can forget the 9 mil, all right?"
00:11:18.500,00:11:21.500,"Shit, I seen one of those bounce off a windshield one time."
00:11:21.500,00:11:22.834,"Yeah, with you shooting."
00:11:24.083,00:11:27.333,"If you're gonna bring a gun, baby, you gotta bring enough gun."
00:11:27.333,00:11:28.417,Forty caliber.
00:11:28.417,00:11:29.875,Uh...
00:11:29.875,00:11:31.834,This is awesome.
00:11:31.834,00:11:34.625,"Yeah. Dad, come check this out."
00:11:34.625,00:11:35.917,"Yeah, I see it."
00:11:35.917,00:11:38.542,"Come on, take it."
00:11:38.542,00:11:40.208,Ooh.
00:11:40.208,00:11:42.000,"No, no, it's just heavy."
00:11:42.000,00:11:43.500,HANK: That's why they hire men.
00:11:45.291,00:11:47.166,"Hey, it's not gonna bite you."
00:11:47.166,00:11:49.834,"Looks like Keith Richards with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he?"
00:11:52.000,00:11:54.750,"Hey, Walt. Everybody, listen up, listen up, listen up."
00:11:54.750,00:11:58.834,"I'm gonna give a toast, a little toast to my brother-in-law. Come here."
00:11:58.834,00:12:06.500,"Walt, you got a brain the size of Wisconsin but we're not gonna hold that against you."
00:12:06.500,00:12:08.500,"But your heart's in the right place, man."
00:12:08.500,00:12:11.166,Your heart's in the right place.
00:12:11.166,00:12:12.500,"Everybody, to Walt."
00:12:12.500,00:12:15.917,ALL: Nostrovia.
00:12:18.875,00:12:21.041,"Oh, shit. Turn on channel three."
00:12:22.750,00:12:26.792,"At which point, we apprehended three individuals and placed them in custody."
00:12:26.792,00:12:37.625,I'm proud to say the outstanding professionalism of my fellow agents at the Albuquerque District Office resulted in a substantial amount of methamphetamine being taken off the streets.
00:12:37.625,00:12:39.583,WOMAN: Were any shots fired?
00:12:39.583,00:12:41.583,Our agents took the suspects by surprise.
00:12:41.583,00:12:44.667,Damn. The TV does add 10 pounds.
00:12:44.667,00:12:46.000,Ten pounds?
00:12:46.000,00:12:48.750,"Hey, sit and spin, both of you."
00:12:48.750,00:12:51.583,Hank.
00:12:51.583,00:12:53.875,Sorry. You didn't see that.
00:12:53.875,00:12:55.792,So charming.
00:12:55.792,00:12:59.333,--clearly an ongoing operation.
00:12:59.333,00:13:02.000,"Hank, how much money is that?"
00:13:02.000,00:13:03.750,It was a pretty good haul.
00:13:03.750,00:13:07.417,It's a good day for the citizens of Albuquerque Wow.
00:13:07.417,00:13:10.041,when we can put this big a dent in the local drug trade.
00:13:10.041,00:13:13.375,"Well, that's unusual, isn't it?"
00:13:13.375,00:13:15.500,"Mm. Well, it's not the most we ever took."
00:13:15.500,00:13:17.875,"It's easy money, till we catch you."
00:13:17.875,00:13:19.625,Heh-heh.
00:13:19.625,00:13:21.750,"Walt, just say the word and I'll take you on a ride-along."
00:13:21.750,00:13:24.166,"You can watch us knock down a meth lab, huh?"
00:13:24.166,00:13:26.834,Get a little excitement in your life.
00:13:26.834,00:13:29.917,"Yeah, someday."
00:13:38.458,00:13:40.291,Which one's this?
00:13:40.291,00:13:43.667,"Um, that faux-Lalique vase I picked up at the Super-Swap."
00:13:43.667,00:13:45.333,Oh.
00:13:49.333,00:13:50.875,How's it doing?
00:13:50.875,00:13:54.291,"Well, I met my reserve and there's still two minutes."
00:13:54.291,00:13:56.333,Mm.
00:14:02.125,00:14:04.000,What's up?
00:14:04.000,00:14:06.500,"You tell me, birthday boy."
00:14:08.917,00:14:11.250,"Oh, hey, so, what's up for Saturday?"
00:14:11.250,00:14:15.458,Mm. Car wash.
00:14:15.458,00:14:17.041,"Till what time? Noon, 1-ish?"
00:14:17.041,00:14:19.875,"Probably 2, more like it."
00:14:19.875,00:14:22.959,And then what after that?
00:14:22.959,00:14:29.333,"Um, actually, ahem, I was thinking of driving up to Los Alamos."
00:14:29.333,00:14:38.333,They've got this-- The visitor center has an exhibit on that's really supposed to be-- You're not gonna paint?
00:14:38.333,00:14:46.834,"It's just that this-- You know, this exhibition on the Mars-rover photographs are..."
00:14:46.834,00:14:50.041,"I mean, the detail really is just supposed to be amazing."
00:14:50.041,00:14:52.834,It's just that I really need you to paint at some point.
00:14:52.834,00:14:54.875,The sooner that back bedroom gets finished...
00:14:54.875,00:14:56.917,I know.
00:14:56.917,00:14:59.834,"And I'd do it myself, except you don't want me on the stepladder."
00:14:59.834,00:15:02.375,I will paint.
00:15:05.291,00:15:08.458,What is going on down there?
00:15:05.291,00:15:09.458,"No, it's-- Is he asleep?"
00:15:09.458,00:15:11.834,No...
00:15:11.834,00:15:14.625,"No, it's nothing. He's just..."
00:15:14.625,00:15:21.333,"You know. Well, you gotta be careful about the baby and-- Well, don't worry about the baby. This is just for you."
00:15:21.333,00:15:25.875,We are just doing you tonight.
00:15:25.875,00:15:31.875,"So just close your eyes, relax, and let it..."
00:15:34.458,00:15:37.458,Close your eyes.
00:15:37.458,00:15:39.250,Okay.
00:15:40.834,00:15:42.875,There you go.
00:15:42.875,00:15:44.875,That's it.
00:15:44.875,00:15:47.041,That's it.
00:15:47.041,00:15:49.834,There you go.
00:15:49.834,00:15:52.291,Keep it going.
00:15:52.291,00:15:54.834,Keep it going.
00:15:54.834,00:15:57.875,Keep it going.
00:15:57.875,00:16:02.375,Keep-- Yes! Fifty-six.
00:16:52.792,00:16:56.500,This is so embarrassing.
00:16:56.500,00:16:58.834,It's just some bug going around.
00:16:58.834,00:17:01.625,"First, my wife had it, then my son, and now me."
00:17:01.625,00:17:05.750,It's just-- It's just like a chest cold.
00:17:05.750,00:17:07.709,Could be some low blood sugar as well.
00:17:07.709,00:17:09.834,I didn't have the greatest breakfast this morning.
00:17:09.834,00:17:11.542,"Honestly, I didn't."
00:17:11.542,00:17:16.834,"Hey, listen, can you do me a favor? Can you just, uh, drop me off at a corner somewhere?"
00:17:16.834,00:17:20.792,"Uh, no, sorry."
00:17:20.792,00:17:23.333,It's just that I don't have the greatest insurance.
00:17:23.333,00:17:25.417,Take a couple of deep breaths for me.
00:17:31.750,00:17:34.166,Is there anybody you want us to contact for you?
00:17:34.166,00:17:36.667,"No. God, no."
00:17:36.667,00:17:38.917,"Lean forward for me, would you?"
00:17:41.792,00:17:43.750,"Mr. White, are you a smoker?"
00:17:43.750,00:17:46.417,"No, never."
00:17:48.000,00:17:49.500,Why do you ask?
00:18:29.041,00:18:31.875,Mr. White?
00:18:31.875,00:18:33.792,Mr. White?
00:18:34.875,00:18:37.166,Yes?
00:18:37.166,00:18:39.625,You understood what I've just said to you?
00:18:39.625,00:18:41.875,Yes.
00:18:41.875,00:18:44.750,Lung cancer. Inoperable.
00:18:46.375,00:18:48.875,I'm sorry.
00:18:46.375,00:18:51.875,I just need to make sure you fully understand.
00:18:51.875,00:18:57.917,"Best-case scenario, with chemo, I'll live maybe another couple years."
00:18:59.500,00:19:04.417,It's just you've got mustard on your...
00:19:05.792,00:19:08.834,Right there.
00:19:08.834,00:19:10.625,Right there.
00:19:19.709,00:19:26.667,"So my records show that I paid it and I certainly don't feel that we owe any late-- Yeah, all right."
00:19:26.667,00:19:32.792,"Well, I'll check with the bank and maybe the post office if they lost it or something."
00:19:32.792,00:19:35.875,"Yeah, let me look into that."
00:19:35.875,00:19:37.208,Thank you.
00:19:40.000,00:19:41.875,Hey.
00:19:41.875,00:19:43.667,Hey.
00:19:43.667,00:19:48.792,"Um, did you use the MasterCard last month?"
00:19:48.792,00:19:52.709,"Uh, fifteen eighty-eight at Staples?"
00:19:56.375,00:19:58.583,Um...
00:19:58.583,00:20:00.625,"Oh, we needed printer paper."
00:20:00.625,00:20:04.834,"Walt, the MasterCard's the one we don't use."
00:20:04.834,00:20:07.250,Okay.
00:20:07.250,00:20:10.417,So how was your day?
00:20:11.542,00:20:13.417,"Oh, you know."
00:20:14.500,00:20:20.709,"I don't know. It was, um, fine."
00:20:47.709,00:20:50.166,"Hey, Walter."
00:20:50.166,00:20:51.792,Walter.
00:20:51.792,00:20:53.917,Walter. Tomorrow night I'm shorthanded.
00:20:53.917,00:20:55.792,I need you outside to do wipe downs.
00:20:55.792,00:20:57.291,Come on.
00:20:57.291,00:20:59.208,I said I need you outside to do some wipe downs.
00:20:59.208,00:21:01.834,"Are you here to work, or to be staring at the skies?"
00:21:01.834,00:21:03.917,Come on. Let's go.
00:21:05.625,00:21:07.250,"Come on, man."
00:21:07.250,00:21:08.834,"Fuck you, Bogdan."
00:21:08.834,00:21:10.083,What?
00:21:10.083,00:21:12.917,"I said, fuck you."
00:21:17.458,00:21:19.500,Wipe down this!
00:22:19.166,00:22:20.750,HANK: Yo.
00:22:20.750,00:22:24.041,"Uh, Hank? Hank, it's Walt. Hey."
00:22:24.041,00:22:26.875,"Oh, listen. I didn't wake you, did I?"
00:22:26.875,00:22:29.250,"Oh, good, good."
00:22:29.250,00:22:33.041,"Oh, no, no."
00:22:33.041,00:22:39.083,I've been thinking about that offer of that ride-along.
00:22:39.083,00:22:41.792,HANK: It's the last house on the right. See it?
00:22:41.792,00:22:43.834,"Not the two-story one, the one next to it."
00:22:43.834,00:22:47.875,"Kind of, uh, I don't know what do you call that? Um, green?"
00:22:47.875,00:22:50.166,Sage.
00:22:50.166,00:22:51.709,Sage?
00:22:51.709,00:22:54.083,Do you work at the fucking Pottery Barn? Jesus.
00:22:54.083,00:22:56.542,Sage.
00:22:56.542,00:22:59.625,My fault the only word your dumb-ass knows is green?
00:22:59.625,00:23:03.333,Cheese-dick. I know that one.
00:23:03.333,00:23:05.834,"Anyway, it's the, um, sage one."
00:23:05.834,00:23:08.333,"WALT: So, what tells you it's a meth lab?"
00:23:08.333,00:23:09.792,HANK: Just our snitch.
00:23:09.792,00:23:14.792,Says some dude who goes by Cap'n Cook lives up to his name in there.
00:23:14.792,00:23:19.000,Says he always adds a dash of chili powder. Heh-heh.
00:23:19.000,00:23:21.458,"Ah, you exuberant Mexicans."
00:23:21.458,00:23:24.625,Uh-uh. Cap'n Cook?
00:23:24.625,00:23:25.834,Dopey as hell too.
00:23:25.834,00:23:27.917,Yeah? I'll tell you what.
00:23:27.917,00:23:30.333,I got you 20 bucks that says he's a beaner.
00:23:30.333,00:23:33.333,All right.
00:23:34.750,00:23:37.667,All right.
00:23:41.500,00:23:43.750,All right. School bus is clear.
00:23:43.750,00:23:45.458,Copy that.
00:23:52.875,00:23:54.792,Watch this. Makes them shit.
00:23:58.875,00:24:00.625,"Go, go, go, go!"
00:24:10.917,00:24:12.875,HANK: Meth labs are nasty on a good day.
00:24:12.875,00:24:15.500,You mix that shit wrong and you got mustard gas.
00:24:15.500,00:24:18.250,Phosphine gas.
00:24:18.250,00:24:20.625,I think.
00:24:20.625,00:24:23.417,One whiff will kill you.
00:25:11.500,00:25:14.000,House is clear.
00:25:14.000,00:25:18.750,"Copy that. The suspect, might he be of the Latino persuasion?"
00:25:18.750,00:25:22.125,Driver's license says Emilio Koyama.
00:25:22.125,00:25:23.166,"Asian. Pay up, sucker."
00:25:23.166,00:25:26.750,"Hey, hey. First name, Emilio."
00:25:26.750,00:25:28.500,That's at least half a beaner.
00:25:28.500,00:25:30.750,"Tell you what, I'll let you off for a 10."
00:25:30.750,00:25:32.834,Whoa.
00:25:32.834,00:25:34.000,"Cheer up, Gomey."
00:25:34.000,00:25:37.375,You people still got J. Lo.
00:25:37.375,00:25:39.792,Do you think I might get to go inside?
00:25:39.792,00:25:41.834,See the actual lab?
00:25:42.875,00:25:46.417,"Uh, yeah."
00:25:46.417,00:25:50.917,"Yeah, I'll tell you what, we'll go peek our heads in, check it out first."
00:25:50.917,00:25:53.917,Stay here a minute.
00:26:13.875,00:26:15.417,"Oh, God."
00:26:23.250,00:26:24.917,"Oh, God."
00:26:32.250,00:26:33.917,"Oh, my God."
00:26:35.417,00:26:36.792,Pinkman?
00:27:33.500,00:27:36.959,"Hey. Uh, it's me. I'm alone."
00:27:43.583,00:27:44.792,How'd you find me?
00:27:44.792,00:27:47.917,You're still in our filing system.
00:27:50.834,00:27:54.333,"So your-- Your aunt owns this place, right?"
00:27:54.333,00:27:55.792,I own it.
00:27:59.000,00:28:00.875,"Look, no one's looking for you."
00:28:00.875,00:28:03.166,Why are you here?
00:28:03.166,00:28:05.208,I was curious.
00:28:05.208,00:28:08.917,"Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much..."
00:28:08.917,00:28:11.333,but methamphetamine.
00:28:11.333,00:28:14.917,I-- I didn't picture that.
00:28:16.166,00:28:17.834,"There's a lot of money in it, huh?"
00:28:17.834,00:28:19.750,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:28:19.750,00:28:21.917,No?
00:28:23.834,00:28:25.917,Cap'n Cook?
00:28:25.917,00:28:27.917,That's not you?
00:28:33.750,00:28:36.333,"Like I said, no one is looking for you."
00:28:36.333,00:28:40.125,"Look, I don't know what you think you're doing here, Mr. White."
00:28:40.125,00:28:46.125,"I mean, if you're planning on giving me some bull-winder about getting right with Jesus or turning myself in."
00:28:46.125,00:28:49.083,Not really.
00:28:49.083,00:28:53.834,"You ain't Welcome Back, Kotter, so step off. No speeches."
00:28:53.834,00:28:55.917,Short speech.
00:28:55.917,00:28:59.458,You lost your partner today.
00:29:00.667,00:29:03.458,Emilio?
00:29:03.458,00:29:05.709,Emilio is going to prison.
00:29:06.875,00:29:10.917,"The DEA took all your money, your lab."
00:29:11.834,00:29:13.875,You've got nothing.
00:29:13.875,00:29:16.125,Square one.
00:29:16.125,00:29:21.834,But you know the business and I know the chemistry.
00:29:24.709,00:29:29.500,I'm thinking maybe you and I could partner up.
00:29:40.625,00:29:44.583,"You, uh-- You wanna cook crystal meth?"
00:29:45.709,00:29:47.083,You.
00:29:47.083,00:29:50.875,"You and, uh-- And me."
00:29:50.875,00:29:52.583,That's right.
00:29:54.000,00:29:55.125,Wow.
00:29:55.125,00:29:59.792,"Either that, or I turn you in."
00:30:09.333,00:30:11.291,What the hell is this?
00:30:11.291,00:30:12.625,SKYLER: Damned if I know.
00:30:12.625,00:30:14.834,I described it as mosaic folk art.
00:30:14.834,00:30:16.291,And somebody bought it?
00:30:16.291,00:30:17.792,"Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis."
00:30:17.792,00:30:20.250,Fourteen dollars plus shipping.
00:30:20.250,00:30:24.500,"At this rate, in 50 or 60 years you'll be rich."
00:30:24.500,00:30:26.000,So how goes the novel?
00:30:26.000,00:30:30.500,"It's not a novel, actually, which I-- You're not writing a novel?"
00:30:30.500,00:30:32.792,You told me you were.
00:30:32.792,00:30:40.083,"I said that if eventually I have enough good ones, that maybe I'll try and publish another collection."
00:30:40.083,00:30:42.792,Those really didn't sell.
00:30:42.792,00:30:46.875,I just thought a novel would be easier to sell.
00:30:46.875,00:30:50.000,"Yeah, well, maybe so."
00:30:50.000,00:30:53.041,"Ever want me to read anything, I could critique it for you."
00:30:53.041,00:30:55.333,Oh.
00:30:55.333,00:30:56.917,No.
00:30:58.417,00:31:02.917,"I mean, I'm just not at that stage where I..."
00:31:02.917,00:31:04.125,No.
00:31:04.125,00:31:07.792,Open offer.
00:31:07.792,00:31:09.000,"So, what's up with Walt lately?"
00:31:09.000,00:31:11.458,What do you mean? He's fine.
00:31:11.458,00:31:13.500,He just seems...
00:31:13.500,00:31:15.709,I don't know.
00:31:15.709,00:31:18.291,"Well, turning 50 is a big deal."
00:31:18.291,00:31:23.542,"I mean, I'm sure as hell not looking forward to 40."
00:31:23.542,00:31:25.917,You're gonna be a complete basket-case.
00:31:30.166,00:31:31.583,So it's a mid-life crisis.
00:31:31.583,00:31:34.834,No. He's just quiet.
00:31:34.834,00:31:35.834,How's the sex?
00:31:35.834,00:31:38.125,"Marie, Jesus."
00:31:38.125,00:31:39.792,I guess that answers that.
00:32:22.625,00:32:23.959,You just gonna sit there?
00:32:32.291,00:32:34.792,Look at this.
00:32:34.792,00:32:39.709,"Kjeldahl-style recovery flask, 800 milliliters. Very rare."
00:32:39.709,00:32:46.709,"You got your usual paraphernalia, Griffin beakers, there's your Erlenmeyer flask."
00:32:42.500,00:32:50.834,"But the pièce de résistance a round bottom boiling flask, 5000 milliliters."
00:32:50.834,00:32:52.083,Huh?
00:32:54.041,00:32:57.333,I cook in one of those.
00:32:58.667,00:33:00.875,One of these?
00:33:00.875,00:33:02.750,"No, this is an volumetric flask."
00:33:02.750,00:33:04.375,You wouldn't cook in one of these.
00:33:04.375,00:33:05.834,"Uh, yeah. I do."
00:33:05.834,00:33:07.625,"Uh, no, you don't."
00:33:07.625,00:33:11.500,A volumetric flask is for general mixing and titration.
00:33:11.500,00:33:14.500,You wouldn't apply heat to a volumetric flask.
00:33:14.500,00:33:16.667,That's what a boiling flask is for.
00:33:16.667,00:33:19.166,Did you not learn nothing from my chemistry class?
00:33:19.166,00:33:22.333,"No. You flunked me, remember?"
00:33:22.333,00:33:24.792,No wonder.
00:33:24.792,00:33:28.500,And let me tell you something else. This ain't chemistry.
00:33:28.500,00:33:30.792,"Okay, this is art."
00:33:30.792,00:33:35.834,"Cooking is art and shit I cook is the bomb, so don't be telling me."
00:33:35.834,00:33:38.375,Shit you cook is shit.
00:33:38.375,00:33:40.750,I saw your setup. Ridiculous.
00:33:40.750,00:33:43.500,You and I will not make garbage.
00:33:43.500,00:33:48.834,We will produce a chemically pure and stable product that performs as advertised.
00:33:48.834,00:33:50.583,No baby formula.
00:33:50.583,00:33:52.875,"No, no. Chili P's my signature."
00:33:52.875,00:33:55.208,Not anymore.
00:33:55.208,00:33:58.375,"Yeah, well, we'll see about that."
00:33:58.375,00:33:59.709,What the hell is this?
00:33:59.709,00:34:01.500,Lab safety equipment.
00:34:01.500,00:34:04.792,We're also gonna have an emergency eye wash station.
00:34:04.792,00:34:07.625,These chemicals and their fumes are toxic.
00:34:07.625,00:34:09.375,In case you didn't you know that.
00:34:09.375,00:34:12.917,"Well, you can dress up like a faggot if you want. Not me."
00:34:17.834,00:34:23.041,"Listen, this stuff doesn't stay more than a day."
00:34:23.041,00:34:24.834,What? I thought we were gonna cook here.
00:34:24.834,00:34:26.583,"No, we're not gonna cook here."
00:34:26.583,00:34:29.709,"Okay, this is my house."
00:34:29.709,00:34:31.417,"Well, then where are we gonna work?"
00:34:31.417,00:34:34.291,You tell me.
00:34:34.291,00:34:36.625,"You wanna smoke it up, smoke it up at your house."
00:34:36.625,00:34:40.917,"No, I didn't think so. Oh, well."
00:34:42.417,00:34:47.959,"Well, what if we rented one of those self-storage places?"
00:34:47.959,00:34:50.917,"You know, those little orange garages? Worked out of there?"
00:34:50.917,00:34:55.041,"No, they're onto that. They've got dogs that sniff around."
00:34:56.667,00:35:00.709,"RV, that's what you want."
00:35:00.709,00:35:02.375,"What, like a Winnebago?"
00:35:04.542,00:35:06.125,Yeah.
00:35:07.709,00:35:10.291,I know a dude who wants to sell his.
00:35:10.291,00:35:12.458,He just goes camping with it.
00:35:12.458,00:35:14.959,But a mobile meth lab?
00:35:14.959,00:35:19.083,"I mean, you can drive way out in the boonies."
00:35:19.083,00:35:20.917,Be all evasive.
00:35:47.792,00:35:50.417,"Dude, this isn't even seven grand, all right?"
00:35:50.417,00:35:51.750,My guy wants 85.
00:35:51.750,00:35:54.875,This is all the money I have in the world.
00:35:54.875,00:35:57.542,You're a drug dealer. Negotiate.
00:35:58.875,00:36:01.792,Y-you are not how I remember you from class.
00:36:01.792,00:36:03.333,"I mean, like, not at all."
00:36:03.333,00:36:04.792,"Yeah, well, I gotta go."
00:36:04.792,00:36:05.875,Wait. Wait. Hold up.
00:36:07.500,00:36:10.834,Tell me why you're doing this.
00:36:10.834,00:36:12.834,Why do you do it?
00:36:12.834,00:36:15.375,"Money, mainly."
00:36:16.542,00:36:17.542,There you go.
00:36:17.542,00:36:20.625,"Nah, come on, man."
00:36:20.625,00:36:26.834,"Some straight like you, giant stick up his ass all a sudden at age, what, 60, he's just gonna break bad?"
00:36:26.834,00:36:29.291,I'm 50.
00:36:29.291,00:36:31.750,"Okay, it doesn't compute."
00:36:29.291,00:36:38.542,"Listen, if you've gone crazy or something, I mean, if y-- If you've gone crazy, or depressed."
00:36:38.542,00:36:40.542,I'm-- I'm just saying.
00:36:40.542,00:36:43.834,T-- That's something I need to know about.
00:36:43.834,00:36:46.166,"Okay, I mean, that affects me."
00:36:51.792,00:36:53.917,I am awake.
00:36:57.834,00:36:59.000,What?
00:37:02.834,00:37:04.250,Buy the RV.
00:37:06.000,00:37:08.083,We start tomorrow.
00:37:13.583,00:37:15.875,SKYLER: How's it coming in there?
00:37:15.875,00:37:17.917,Fine.
00:37:24.125,00:37:26.709,Do you want me or your dad?
00:37:28.458,00:37:30.709,Dad.
00:37:46.208,00:37:49.166,SKYLER: So how are those feeling in the waist? Are they too tight?
00:37:49.166,00:37:51.750,You don't want to get them if they're too tight.
00:37:51.750,00:37:55.083,They're-- They're pretty shrunk.
00:37:55.083,00:37:57.959,Are you sure you don't want the--? Like a different kind?
00:37:57.959,00:38:02.834,"Like, you know, the skinny jeans, because those are in style."
00:38:02.834,00:38:05.375,Do I look like a skater?
00:38:05.375,00:38:06.834,All right.
00:38:06.834,00:38:09.875,"Mom, get them, my big boy pants."
00:38:11.250,00:38:14.208,"Mommy, could you zip up my big boy pants?"
00:38:20.792,00:38:22.000,Don't.
00:38:23.834,00:38:25.083,Don't.
00:38:25.083,00:38:26.709,Walt.
00:38:29.166,00:38:30.959,Where--?
00:38:32.500,00:38:34.750,"No, you know what?"
00:38:34.750,00:38:37.917,They're obviously very stupid.
00:38:37.917,00:38:39.250,Yeah.
00:38:41.083,00:38:44.417,"I think that, um-- I think those jeans look really good on you."
00:38:44.417,00:38:47.417,"I think you should get them if you like them, okay?"
00:38:47.417,00:38:50.291,Why don't you hang out here for a second. I'll be right back.
00:38:50.291,00:38:51.792,Fine.
00:38:51.792,00:38:56.709,"Hey, Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf in my brand new big boy pants."
00:39:03.834,00:39:05.542,What are you doing?
00:39:05.542,00:39:08.291,"What's wrong, chief?"
00:39:08.291,00:39:10.291,Get off me! Get off me!
00:39:13.458,00:39:15.166,"I'll mess you up, man."
00:39:15.166,00:39:17.834,You'll have one shot.
00:39:17.834,00:39:20.375,"You waiting for, your girlfriends? You better go."
00:39:20.375,00:39:23.625,You'd better go. Take it.
00:39:24.625,00:39:26.166,Come on.
00:39:26.166,00:39:28.583,Come on.
00:39:28.583,00:39:29.917,Let's go.
00:39:31.500,00:39:33.041,Psycho.
00:40:08.667,00:40:11.208,"Yeah, nothing but cows."
00:40:11.208,00:40:17.583,"Got some big cow house way out that way, like two miles, but I don't see nobody."
00:40:17.583,00:40:19.208,Cow house?
00:40:19.208,00:40:22.208,Yeah. Where they live.
00:40:22.208,00:40:24.750,The cows.
00:40:24.750,00:40:29.208,"Whatever, man."
00:40:30.834,00:40:33.166,Cow house.
00:40:33.166,00:40:34.834,God help me.
00:40:44.875,00:40:48.166,"Uh, what are you doing?"
00:40:48.166,00:40:51.375,These are my good clothes.
00:40:51.375,00:40:53.875,You can't go home smelling like a meth lab.
00:40:53.875,00:40:56.834,"Uh, yeah, you can. I do."
00:40:56.834,00:40:58.792,Those?
00:40:58.792,00:41:02.875,"Wow. Those, uh..."
00:41:10.834,00:41:13.667,Come on. Daylight's burning.
00:41:13.667,00:41:15.792,"Oh, my God."
00:41:23.583,00:41:26.417,"Wow, this is-- This is a good look for you."
00:41:26.417,00:41:29.875,"I mean, you're maybe only the world's second-biggest homo."
00:41:29.875,00:41:32.834,Would you shut up and help me?
00:41:32.834,00:41:35.250,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
00:41:35.250,00:41:37.834,"Work it. Baby, work it."
00:41:37.834,00:41:39.792,Turn that off.
00:41:39.792,00:42:49.333,CITY'S DEAD FINGERS TALKING This is glass-grade.
00:42:49.333,00:42:54.959,"You got-- Jesus, you got crystals in here two inches, three inches long."
00:42:54.959,00:42:56.917,This is pure glass.
00:42:58.417,00:43:01.208,You're a goddamn artist.
00:43:01.208,00:43:04.125,"This-- This is art, Mr. White."
00:43:04.125,00:43:09.792,"Well, actually, it's just basic chemistry, but thank you, Jesse."
00:43:09.792,00:43:12.667,Acceptable?
00:43:12.667,00:43:15.709,Every jibhead from here to Timbuktu's gonna want a taste.
00:43:16.834,00:43:18.875,"Man, I-- I gotta try this."
00:43:18.875,00:43:22.375,No. No.
00:43:22.375,00:43:24.917,No. We only sell it.
00:43:26.041,00:43:28.542,"Okay, since when?"
00:43:28.542,00:43:31.208,"Listen, you've been watching way too much Miami Vice."
00:43:31.208,00:43:32.750,That ain't happening.
00:43:36.500,00:43:39.667,"So, what now?"
00:43:41.208,00:43:42.750,How do we proceed?
00:43:46.625,00:43:49.834,We cook more tomorrow.
00:43:49.834,00:43:54.792,"Meantime, I know just the guy to talk to."
00:43:56.792,00:43:58.834,Get him. Come on.
00:44:03.792,00:44:07.166,"Hey, yo. Kraze, how you doing, my man?"
00:44:09.208,00:44:13.709,"Hey, you got a new dog."
00:44:13.709,00:44:16.667,What's his name?
00:44:16.667,00:44:20.875,"Yeah, I had a dog like that once, except maybe like twice as big."
00:44:20.875,00:44:22.542,Super-purebred.
00:44:22.542,00:44:26.417,"Now, me personally, I would train him to go straight for the nutsack."
00:44:26.417,00:44:28.709,Just shut your mouth and show me your money.
00:44:28.709,00:44:30.291,"I ain't buying, ese."
00:44:30.291,00:44:33.000,I'm selling.
00:44:41.834,00:44:45.750,Tell me that ain't the finest scante you ever laid eyes on.
00:44:45.750,00:44:48.875,Go ahead. Try it.
00:44:48.875,00:44:51.834,"Hey, poochie. How you doing?"
00:44:51.834,00:44:54.709,Jesus Christ.
00:44:54.709,00:44:58.041,"Yeah. Booya! See, what'd I say?"
00:44:58.041,00:45:00.792,It's all right.
00:45:00.792,00:45:02.792,It's all right?
00:45:02.792,00:45:04.333,So what? You're back in business?
00:45:04.333,00:45:06.000,"Hell, yeah, I'm back."
00:45:06.000,00:45:09.750,With a vengeance.
00:45:09.750,00:45:12.875,"You know, with your cousin gone away and all..."
00:45:12.875,00:45:16.333,"And listen, homes, about that..."
00:45:17.834,00:45:20.875,Really broke me up about Emilio.
00:45:20.875,00:45:23.208,That dude is like my brother.
00:45:23.208,00:45:24.959,You okay? You talk to him?
00:45:24.959,00:45:26.333,"Yeah, I talk to him."
00:45:26.333,00:45:30.583,"Said when the feds came, you were out sticking it in some neighbor lady."
00:45:30.583,00:45:32.834,"Hey, you know, I got lucky twice."
00:45:32.834,00:45:35.000,"I don't know, man."
00:45:35.000,00:45:41.417,"Emilio, he thinks maybe you dimed on him."
00:45:41.417,00:45:45.834,"Whoa, whoa, hey, hey."
00:45:45.834,00:45:47.875,"That is bullshit, Krazy-8."
00:45:47.875,00:45:50.834,I should kick his punk ass for even thinking that.
00:45:50.834,00:45:55.875,"You know what? Next time you talk to Emilio, you tell him for me, all right?"
00:45:59.500,00:46:02.834,Why don't you tell him yourself?
00:46:02.834,00:46:06.041,"Go ahead, pendejo. Kick my ass."
00:46:06.041,00:46:12.959,"Hey, listen-- Where did you get this?"
00:46:12.959,00:46:14.834,Hm?
00:46:14.834,00:46:17.959,Because I know your little punk ass didn't cook it.
00:46:46.458,00:46:50.917,"Damn, man. What are you, some kind of nudist?"
00:46:52.417,00:46:56.125,"Yeah, that's some stone-fine tick-tick you been cooking there, ese."
00:46:56.125,00:46:57.917,How about you come work for me?
00:46:59.709,00:47:04.375,I'd be willing to sell it to you if-- If the price is right.
00:47:15.166,00:47:17.500,"Out here all by yourself, huh?"
00:47:24.792,00:47:29.083,"Hey, I know you."
00:47:29.083,00:47:31.291,He's with the DEA.
00:47:31.291,00:47:34.750,You rata snitch motherfucker.
00:47:34.750,00:47:36.375,"Run, Mr. White! Run!"
00:47:38.291,00:47:39.625,Ah.
00:47:46.583,00:47:48.208,I say we cap them both.
00:47:55.542,00:47:57.792,You really cook up that batch?
00:47:59.375,00:48:00.417,Yeah.
00:48:00.417,00:48:02.542,You an artist.
00:48:03.959,00:48:05.834,It's a damn shame.
00:48:05.834,00:48:09.000,Wait a minute.
00:48:09.000,00:48:13.834,Listen to me.
00:48:13.834,00:48:16.250,What do you say?
00:48:19.500,00:48:26.500,"You let us both live, and I will teach you, huh?"
00:48:55.834,00:48:57.959,Put the cigarette out.
00:49:00.625,00:49:02.125,Please...
00:49:45.333,00:49:49.125,"Move it, homes."
00:49:51.583,00:49:52.959,Okay.
00:52:12.375,00:52:13.750,Shit.
00:52:17.834,00:52:19.542,Shit!
00:54:03.667,00:54:05.917,What happened?
00:54:08.625,00:54:11.333,"Hey, what'd you do to them?"
00:54:12.959,00:54:20.458,Red phosphorus in the presence of moisture and accelerated by heat yields phosphorus hydride.
00:54:20.458,00:54:22.834,Phosphine gas.
00:54:22.834,00:54:24.917,One good whiff and...
00:54:49.667,00:54:51.291,We gotta...
00:54:53.250,00:54:56.750,We gotta clean this up.
00:55:43.875,00:55:45.750,Where were you?
00:55:53.875,00:55:55.625,Walt...
00:55:58.125,00:56:03.792,"I don't know what's been going on with you lately, but-- Nothing, honey. I'm fine."
00:56:03.792,00:56:08.625,"Whatever it is, I'll tell you this."
00:56:08.625,00:56:11.917,I do not like it when you don't talk to me.
00:56:13.166,00:56:16.250,The worst thing you can do is shut me out.
00:57:02.291,00:57:04.000,Walt...
00:57:06.458,00:57:10.041,"Oh, Walt, is that you?"
00:00:19.542,00:00:21.333,Are you okay?
00:01:53.750,00:01:56.250,You are a lifesaver.
00:01:56.250,00:01:57.709,"Yeah, we can't thank you enough."
00:01:57.709,00:01:59.083,"No, hey, mad-- Mad props."
00:01:59.083,00:02:01.208,I could have sworn the guy said south.
00:02:01.208,00:02:07.667,"But then all of a sudden we're off the main road then I'm trying to read the map while driving, which is a bonehead maneuver."
00:02:07.667,00:02:10.333,"And then all of a sudden, bam, we're-- We're in that ditch."
00:02:10.333,00:02:12.875,"Yeah, bam. I'm like, What the hell? You know?"
00:02:12.875,00:02:16.792,"Yes. Oh, yes, and my coffee mug."
00:02:16.792,00:02:20.750,"It spills all over my pants, I mean-- Just a nightmare."
00:02:20.750,00:02:23.083,"There's your Sony GPS, I mean, for real."
00:02:38.125,00:02:39.834,Let's just...
00:02:45.834,00:02:51.458,"Like I said, we couldn't be more grateful."
00:03:06.083,00:03:08.583,Can't we just dump them here?
00:03:08.583,00:03:10.375,"What, and somebody finds them?"
00:03:10.375,00:03:11.792,Then what?
00:03:11.792,00:03:13.709,People have seen us.
00:03:19.875,00:03:21.792,"Hey, you're-- You're gonna flood it, man."
00:03:21.792,00:03:22.959,I'm not gonna flood it.
00:03:22.959,00:03:24.458,"She's not going to flood, all right?"
00:03:24.458,00:03:27.125,"We're just gonna stay positive, right?"
00:03:27.125,00:03:28.792,We're gonna clean up this mess.
00:03:28.792,00:03:31.375,"And you, start."
00:03:31.375,00:03:33.417,"Goddamn it. See, you flooded it."
00:03:33.417,00:03:35.083,All right.
00:03:35.083,00:03:38.667,All right. You know what?
00:03:38.667,00:03:40.583,The RV is going to start right now.
00:03:40.583,00:03:42.792,It's gonna start and we're gonna drive it to your house.
00:03:42.792,00:03:45.667,My house?
00:03:42.792,00:03:47.875,Yes. We're gonna drive it over and park it overnight.
00:03:45.667,00:03:49.792,"And then tomorrow-- Uh-uh, man, not my house."
00:03:49.792,00:03:52.959,Shut up! Shut up!
00:04:04.917,00:04:10.959,"After we finish cleaning up this mess, we will go our separate ways."
00:04:10.959,00:04:13.875,Our paths will never cross.
00:04:13.875,00:04:16.625,And we will tell this to no one.
00:04:16.625,00:04:18.083,Understood?
00:04:20.875,00:04:23.834,"Oh, what, I can talk now?"
00:04:23.834,00:04:28.291,Fine. That goes double for me.
00:04:31.250,00:04:34.208,Okay. Okay.
00:04:34.208,00:04:36.083,Be good to me.
00:04:41.333,00:04:43.000,BOTH: Yes!
00:04:48.667,00:04:50.375,Yes. Okay. Okay.
00:04:50.375,00:04:51.875,Thank you.
00:05:11.709,00:05:14.208,"Oh, shit."
00:05:40.500,00:05:42.125,SKYLER: Walt?
00:05:44.500,00:05:46.875,You coming out?
00:05:50.083,00:05:51.458,Hm?
00:05:55.083,00:05:57.625,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:05:57.625,00:06:00.583,"We got looky-loos in both directions, Dan."
00:06:00.583,00:06:03.208,Better plan on being late if you're going in that direction.
00:06:03.208,00:06:09.250,"This is Lisa in the Skycopter, we'll have more Albuquerque traffic on the hour."
00:06:09.250,00:06:12.250,"Hey, um, you wanna hear something funny?"
00:06:13.917,00:06:29.083,We had a-- A faculty meeting last Thursday and the topic was senior-class photos and how we had instituted a new rule last year that seniors are allowed to have photos taken by a photographer of their choice.
00:06:29.083,00:06:32.917,"You know, not necessarily the photographer that the school hires, right?"
00:06:32.917,00:06:38.208,"So-- --um, uh, so anyway, uh, some of the senior girls..."
00:06:39.750,00:06:44.750,"...were going to that, um, Glamour Shots place to have their photos taken."
00:06:44.750,00:06:50.417,"And now they're bringing us all these photos, and Joan Everman-- You know Joan."
00:06:50.417,00:06:56.792,--suddenly has to go through all these photos and turn them down because they show cleavage.
00:06:59.959,00:07:01.834,"Did you get enough pancakes, sweetie?"
00:07:01.834,00:07:04.834,Y-yeah. I-- I'm good.
00:07:04.834,00:07:06.250,Okay.
00:07:06.250,00:07:09.542,"WALT: You know, even the small-busted girls have cleavage."
00:07:09.542,00:07:15.500,Apparently there's some new type of brassiere or something.
00:07:17.333,00:07:19.834,The Wonderbra.
00:07:19.834,00:07:22.041,It's the Wonderbra.
00:07:22.041,00:07:24.417,Yeah?
00:07:24.417,00:07:26.917,Okay.
00:07:29.792,00:07:33.375,"You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter Jr."
00:07:33.375,00:07:36.959,"We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave us a message."
00:07:36.959,00:07:38.792,"Hello, Mr. White."
00:07:38.792,00:07:40.792,This is AT&amp;T calling.
00:07:40.792,00:07:43.875,Are you happy with your current long-distance service?
00:07:43.875,00:07:51.792,"Because if you're not, I would definitely really, really love to talk to you as soon as possible about-- Hello? Hello? Hello, this is Walter White speaking."
00:07:51.792,00:07:53.834,"You said he was practically dead, okay?"
00:07:53.834,00:07:55.792,You said he would die any minute.
00:07:55.792,00:08:02.333,"Listen, uh, I am having breakfast with my family right now and I-- I really don't appreciate these sales calls."
00:08:02.333,00:08:04.917,"Well, too bad, man, because guess what."
00:08:04.917,00:08:06.792,He's still not dead.
00:08:06.792,00:08:08.333,I went and put my ear to the RV.
00:08:08.333,00:08:11.625,"I can hear him, like, rolling around in there, all right?"
00:08:11.625,00:08:13.041,"I-- I-- I think he's awake, man."
00:08:13.041,00:08:14.750,I think he's trying to get loose.
00:08:14.750,00:08:16.875,Where the hell are you?
00:08:16.875,00:08:18.417,"Calm down, damn it."
00:08:18.417,00:08:20.166,You gonna help me clean this up?
00:08:20.166,00:08:21.959,Huh? We got loose ends here.
00:08:21.959,00:08:23.583,Calm down.
00:08:23.583,00:08:25.166,I will be there after school.
00:08:25.166,00:08:27.583,"Huh, after school."
00:08:27.583,00:08:29.709,"Ditch it, man. Call in sick."
00:08:29.709,00:08:32.583,"Listen, uh, that is just not gonna work for me."
00:08:32.583,00:08:34.458,I'm-- I'm not interested in that at all.
00:08:34.458,00:08:37.792,"And, uh, I would appreciate it if you don't call here anymore."
00:08:37.792,00:08:40.917,"Damn. They're so annoying, those people."
00:08:45.709,00:08:46.917,"You have a good day, sweetie."
00:08:46.917,00:08:48.250,"Okay, Mom. You too."
00:08:48.250,00:08:49.542,Okay.
00:08:49.542,00:08:51.000,"Bye, honey."
00:08:55.667,00:08:57.041,Drive safe.
00:09:09.542,00:09:15.250,"Yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3 to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ."
00:09:15.250,00:09:17.792,"What up, beyotch?"
00:09:33.834,00:09:41.417,So the term chiral derives from the Greek word hand.
00:09:41.417,00:10:01.583,"Now, the concept here being that just as your left hand and your right hand are mirror images of one another, right, identical and yet opposite, well, so, too, organic compounds can exist as mirror-image forms of one another all the way down at the molecular level."
00:10:01.583,00:10:08.834,"But although they may look the same, they don't always behave the same."
00:10:08.834,00:10:10.500,For instance...
00:10:13.041,00:10:15.625,For instance...
00:10:16.792,00:10:19.834,"Uh, I'm sorry."
00:10:19.834,00:10:21.750,Thalidomide.
00:10:21.750,00:10:31.792,"The-- The right-handed isomer of the drug thalidomide is a perfectly fine, good medicine to give to a pregnant woman to prevent morning sickness."
00:10:31.792,00:10:44.959,But make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman the left-handed isomer of the drug thalidomide and her child will be born with horrible birth defects.
00:10:46.834,00:10:50.709,Which is precisely what happened in the 1950s.
00:10:50.709,00:10:56.959,"So chiral, chirality, mirrored images, right?"
00:10:56.959,00:11:00.792,"Active, inactive, good, bad."
00:11:04.000,00:11:06.417,"Uh, so."
00:11:06.417,00:11:07.667,"Yes, Ben."
00:11:07.667,00:11:09.542,Is this gonna be on the murder?
00:11:12.125,00:11:13.458,What?
00:11:13.458,00:11:16.000,Is this gonna be on the midterm?
00:11:17.709,00:11:20.250,"Uh, chirality on the midterm?"
00:11:20.250,00:11:22.208,"No, no. Well, maybe."
00:11:22.208,00:11:26.709,"Maybe. Yes, you know-- But prepare for it to be on the midterm."
00:11:26.709,00:11:29.041,"Can't hurt to know it, right?"
00:11:26.709,00:11:31.041,So-- Knowledge is power.
00:12:46.834,00:12:49.625,"Oh, no. Oh, no, no. No."
00:12:56.792,00:12:58.792,Not good.
00:13:17.417,00:13:18.583,What the--?
00:13:39.500,00:13:42.875,"Hey. Hey. Hey, you."
00:13:42.875,00:13:44.875,"Hey, listen, you."
00:13:44.875,00:13:46.583,"No, no, no, no!"
00:13:50.750,00:13:52.834,"Oh, God."
00:14:36.291,00:14:37.834,Okay.
00:14:54.417,00:14:57.125,MILFs?
00:14:57.125,00:14:59.000,The hell is a MILF?
00:15:18.834,00:15:20.917,Now what?
00:15:24.291,00:15:26.542,Lock the other one out in the RV.
00:15:26.542,00:15:29.709,"He's, uh: You're sure?"
00:15:29.709,00:15:31.208,You're positive?
00:15:31.208,00:15:32.834,Feel free to go check it yourself.
00:15:32.834,00:15:34.583,"Hey, yeah, Good idea."
00:15:32.834,00:15:36.750,"Maybe I should do that before he, too, wanders off down the damn street."
00:15:36.750,00:15:37.959,"Okay, you know what?"
00:15:36.750,00:15:39.333,I am sick-- Just-- All right.
00:15:39.333,00:15:44.166,"Just-- The one downstairs, tell me about him."
00:15:44.166,00:15:45.792,"Oh, come on. Anything."
00:15:45.792,00:15:47.667,"Start with his name, at least."
00:15:47.667,00:15:48.959,Krazy-8.
00:15:48.959,00:15:51.875,Krazy-8. What the hell does that even mean?
00:15:51.875,00:15:53.417,"I don't know, man, okay?"
00:15:53.417,00:15:56.667,"It means, like-- Like, Krazy-8, okay? I don't know."
00:15:56.667,00:15:59.792,So you work with him regularly.
00:15:59.792,00:16:01.875,"No, not him so much."
00:16:01.875,00:16:03.834,"His cousin, mainly."
00:16:03.834,00:16:06.500,Who's his cousin?
00:16:06.500,00:16:07.875,"All right, all right, all right."
00:16:07.875,00:16:10.709,Krazy-8's one level higher.
00:16:10.709,00:16:12.291,One level higher.
00:16:12.291,00:16:16.000,"Yeah, you know."
00:16:16.000,00:16:19.041,"You know how there's, like, a Starbucks on every corner?"
00:16:19.041,00:16:22.917,Krazy-8 is like the dude that sells Starbucks' beans.
00:16:22.917,00:16:25.750,"Okay, so he's a distributor."
00:16:25.750,00:16:30.291,"Okay, so is he...?"
00:16:30.291,00:16:35.750,"In other words, what is his reputation for violence?"
00:16:35.750,00:16:40.750,"Well, um, he did try to kill us both yesterday, so there's that."
00:16:40.750,00:16:44.000,"Look, what I'm trying to say is that he's a distributor, right?"
00:16:44.000,00:16:47.625,He's a-- He's a businessman.
00:16:47.625,00:16:53.959,"It would therefore seem to follow that he is capable of acting out of mutual self-interest, yes?"
00:16:53.959,00:16:55.792,What?
00:16:55.792,00:17:01.583,Do you think he is capable of listening to reason?
00:17:01.583,00:17:08.333,"I mean, what--? What kind of reason? You mean, like, Dear Krazy-8, hey, listen, if I let you go, you promise not to come back and waste my entire family?"
00:17:08.333,00:17:10.917,No Colombian neckties?
00:17:10.917,00:17:15.083,"No, man, I can't say as I have high fucking hopes where that's concerned."
00:17:20.959,00:17:23.458,What was that?
00:17:23.458,00:17:25.166,What was what?
00:17:29.750,00:17:32.583,Come!
00:17:32.583,00:17:33.959,We didn't tie him up.
00:17:33.959,00:17:35.542,Why the hell didn't we tie him up?
00:17:35.542,00:17:37.083,"Oh, God."
00:17:37.083,00:17:38.709,Because he was out cold.
00:17:38.709,00:17:40.750,"Yeah, but what-- What if he's faking it?"
00:17:40.750,00:17:45.583,"You know, like, if it was me, I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo."
00:17:45.583,00:17:50.083,"And then, when the coast is clear, I'd be up looking for weapons and shit."
00:17:50.083,00:17:51.500,Ready to pounce.
00:18:04.834,00:18:06.667,"Shh, shh, shh."
00:18:16.250,00:18:23.834,"No, see. Now, if it was me and I couldn't find a decent enough weapon, I would just lie back down and bide my time."
00:19:16.834,00:19:19.959,So now what do we do?
00:19:24.166,00:19:30.375,You keep asking me that like you think I have some answer.
00:19:31.792,00:19:34.500,"Well, you gotta do something."
00:19:34.500,00:19:37.500,"We have got to do something, and I am open to suggestions."
00:19:37.500,00:19:40.208,"Man, uh, okay, this whole thing was your deal."
00:19:40.208,00:19:42.500,Don't you dare put that on me.
00:19:42.500,00:19:44.125,You brought those guys out there.
00:19:44.125,00:19:45.667,This is your responsibility.
00:19:45.667,00:19:48.125,"Oh, like I came to you, begging to cook meth."
00:19:48.125,00:19:52.875,"Oh, hey, nerdiest old dude I know, you wanna come cook crystal?"
00:19:52.875,00:19:56.917,I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny but her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV.
00:20:03.750,00:20:06.792,"What about the, uh-- The-- The-- The phosphate gas?"
00:20:06.792,00:20:09.208,The phosphine gas.
00:20:09.208,00:20:12.417,"Well, do-- I mean, do you think it still might kill him?"
00:20:12.417,00:20:15.083,"You know, with, like, a delayed reaction or something?"
00:20:17.625,00:20:18.792,I-- I don't know.
00:20:18.792,00:20:20.500,You're supposed to be a scientist.
00:20:20.500,00:20:25.959,"Look, this isn't even the issue that demands immediate attention."
00:20:25.959,00:20:28.417,We have got a body in that RV.
00:20:28.417,00:20:29.834,And it's getting warmer outside.
00:20:29.834,00:20:31.291,Understand?
00:20:31.291,00:20:34.542,And we have got to do something about that soon.
00:20:34.542,00:20:36.917,And in a way that no one will ever find it.
00:20:36.917,00:20:41.917,"Now, that-- That last part is very, very important."
00:20:41.917,00:20:53.166,"Therefore, it seems to me that our best course of action would be chemical disincorporation."
00:20:55.625,00:20:59.166,Dissolving in strong acid.
00:21:05.458,00:21:08.041,"Oh, man, that's messed up."
00:21:09.625,00:21:12.000,"I mean, ahem, you're not serious."
00:21:15.208,00:21:16.917,You serious?
00:21:23.834,00:21:25.834,"Well, who's gonna do that?"
00:21:25.834,00:21:27.917,And don't look at me.
00:21:30.166,00:21:32.291,I guess we'll both do it together.
00:21:32.291,00:21:35.625,"No, Mr. White, okay, I'm not-- I'm not good with dead bodies."
00:21:35.625,00:21:40.500,"Look, we are in this fifty-fifty. Okay?"
00:21:43.375,00:21:59.917,I guess the only other fair way to go about this would be that one of us deals with the body situation while the other one of us deals with the Krazy-8 situation.
00:22:07.792,00:22:16.083,"In a scenario like this, I don't suppose it is bad form to just flip a coin."
00:22:22.834,00:22:24.583,Heads or tails?
00:22:24.583,00:22:27.500,"No, I'll-- I'll do the body in the acid, okay?"
00:22:27.500,00:22:29.750,Heads or tails?
00:22:38.375,00:22:40.917,Heads. Heads.
00:22:58.875,00:23:00.917,Best two out of three?
00:23:17.166,00:23:23.083,"Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3 to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ."
00:23:27.583,00:23:30.792,"JESSE: Hey, Mr. White, it's me."
00:23:30.792,00:23:32.917,I got a container question.
00:23:34.417,00:23:37.458,"Hello, Mr. White."
00:23:37.458,00:23:38.834,Yes.
00:23:38.834,00:23:40.125,"Yo, what kind of plastic, man?"
00:23:40.125,00:23:42.500,Polyethylene.
00:23:43.834,00:23:45.834,"Well, how the hell am I supposed to know that?"
00:23:45.834,00:23:47.750,Because I told you.
00:23:47.750,00:23:48.875,"Look, just..."
00:23:50.166,00:23:56.709,...look at the bottom for a triangle stamped LDPE.
00:23:56.709,00:23:58.917,It should be molded right into the plastic.
00:23:58.917,00:24:01.834,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, LDPE."
00:24:01.834,00:24:06.291,"I don't know, man."
00:24:06.291,00:24:08.834,Any decent acid's gonna eat right through this.
00:24:08.834,00:24:10.834,Not hydrofluoric.
00:24:10.834,00:24:12.166,Why not?
00:24:13.792,00:24:21.959,"Look, you skipped, clowned around or otherwise jerked off through every lecture I ever gave."
00:24:21.959,00:24:25.375,"As far as I'm concerned, your chemistry education is over."
00:24:25.375,00:24:28.083,"Oh, okay, be a dick about it."
00:24:30.834,00:24:33.792,"So, hey, have you, um...?"
00:24:33.792,00:24:35.917,Have you done the--?
00:24:40.208,00:24:43.959,"Yeah, I'm-- I'm working up to it."
00:24:47.250,00:24:48.792,You know what?
00:24:48.792,00:24:50.709,I bet he doesn't even wake up.
00:24:51.792,00:24:54.709,"You know, not even if you took him to the hospital right now."
00:24:55.834,00:25:02.834,"Now, if it was me, I would just try and think of it like I was-- I was doing him a favor."
00:25:27.542,00:25:30.667,I need a check approval on checkstand eight.
00:25:30.667,00:25:34.166,"Approval on checkstand eight, please. Thank you."
00:25:47.750,00:25:49.625,Yeah.
00:27:14.875,00:27:16.792,Who's there?
00:27:20.500,00:27:22.750,"What, you fucking break in?"
00:27:27.583,00:27:30.000,Yeah. I see you.
00:27:33.125,00:27:34.583,What you gonna do?
00:27:36.041,00:27:38.083,Hey.
00:27:38.083,00:27:39.333,Hey--!
00:27:44.875,00:27:47.000,Hey!
00:27:47.000,00:27:48.333,I need water.
00:27:50.291,00:27:53.458,"Hey, hello."
00:27:53.458,00:27:55.625,"Bring me some water, would you?"
00:27:58.000,00:27:59.583,Please.
00:29:14.291,00:29:16.375,You don't like the crust?
00:29:27.834,00:29:29.375,Where's my cousin Emilio?
00:29:34.417,00:29:36.500,He dead?
00:29:59.834,00:30:02.917,"Oh, I'm a coward."
00:31:29.709,00:31:30.875,"JESSE: Hey, Mr. White."
00:31:32.166,00:31:35.375,"Hey, Mr. White?"
00:31:35.375,00:31:36.792,"Oh, fuck."
00:31:40.125,00:31:44.291,Are you smoking weed?
00:31:44.291,00:31:47.208,"Wait a minute, is that--?"
00:31:48.750,00:31:50.834,"What the hell, man?"
00:31:50.834,00:31:52.917,"Make yourself at home, why don't you?"
00:31:56.542,00:31:58.875,"So, what'd you end up buying?"
00:31:58.875,00:32:01.792,Nothing.
00:32:01.792,00:32:05.917,No store in town sells a plastic bin big enough for a body.
00:32:07.208,00:32:10.834,I don't suppose you could buy two bins?
00:32:10.834,00:32:17.834,"And, uh, just: Legs in one, torso in the other?"
00:32:17.834,00:32:21.000,"Oh, God."
00:32:21.000,00:32:23.917,I don't suppose you could kiss my ass?
00:32:32.458,00:32:37.834,"So, uh, how'd it--? How'd it go?"
00:32:44.834,00:32:46.667,You didn't do it?
00:32:46.667,00:32:48.375,Not-- Not yet.
00:32:48.375,00:32:51.542,"Oh, God."
00:32:53.542,00:32:56.333,"Oh, damn. I gotta go."
00:32:56.333,00:32:59.750,"What? No, no, no."
00:32:59.750,00:33:01.750,"Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow, I promise."
00:33:01.750,00:33:03.208,Tomorrow?
00:33:03.208,00:33:05.500,I've got a doctor's appointment.
00:33:05.500,00:33:08.959,"Look, stay away from him."
00:33:11.875,00:33:13.583,"Hey, man, we flipped a coin."
00:33:16.500,00:33:18.917,We flipped a coin!
00:33:23.834,00:33:26.500,We're-- We're good?
00:33:26.500,00:33:30.041,We're very good.
00:33:31.583,00:33:32.959,Oh.
00:33:32.959,00:33:36.834,"Oh, would you look at that face?"
00:33:37.875,00:33:39.625,"Smile, peanut."
00:33:43.166,00:33:44.959,So who's up for knowing?
00:33:46.250,00:33:47.583,Oh...
00:33:49.208,00:33:51.250,It's-- It's...
00:33:52.583,00:33:53.834,Yeah.
00:33:53.834,00:33:54.917,Girl.
00:33:54.917,00:33:56.875,Girl?
00:33:56.875,00:33:57.917,You sure?
00:33:57.917,00:34:00.291,Pretty sure.
00:34:00.291,00:34:01.875,Wow.
00:34:03.792,00:34:06.875,"Oh, God. Can I tell you, that's exactly what I was hoping."
00:34:06.875,00:34:08.792,Yeah?
00:34:08.792,00:34:12.000,You remember you said that when she's 16 and starts dating.
00:34:13.375,00:34:15.000,Looking fabulous.
00:34:15.000,00:34:20.667,"Let me see if they're done with the blood sugar, then we'll get you out of here."
00:34:47.500,00:34:49.667,Who's Jesse Pinkman?
00:34:56.375,00:34:57.709,Jesse...?
00:34:57.709,00:35:00.583,Jesse Pinkman.
00:35:01.792,00:35:04.834,He-- He called just this morning.
00:35:06.125,00:35:07.750,"Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:07.750,00:35:11.667,It-- It says on his MyShout page he attended Wynne.
00:35:11.667,00:35:13.583,"What, was he one of your students?"
00:35:13.583,00:35:14.875,Yeah.
00:35:14.875,00:35:17.542,He was nobody.
00:35:19.709,00:35:21.750,Who--? Who is he to you?
00:35:21.750,00:35:24.542,Why--? Why is he calling?
00:35:21.750,00:35:28.208,What is this big secret you seem to be discussing with some druggie burnout?
00:35:31.542,00:35:35.542,You don't come home last night until 2 in the morning.
00:35:35.542,00:35:37.083,You don't tell me where you've been.
00:35:37.083,00:35:41.208,"You spent the entire night in the bathroom, Walt."
00:35:41.208,00:35:44.750,Tell me what's going on with you.
00:35:44.750,00:35:47.333,Don't you think you owe me that?
00:35:50.583,00:35:53.917,Who is this Jesse Pinkman to you?
00:35:58.041,00:36:00.917,He sells me pot.
00:36:03.125,00:36:06.125,He sells you pot?
00:36:06.125,00:36:08.166,"Marijuana, yeah."
00:36:08.166,00:36:12.583,Not a lot.
00:36:14.166,00:36:16.750,I kind of like it.
00:36:16.750,00:36:19.792,Are you out of your mind?
00:36:19.792,00:36:21.792,"What--? What are you, like, 16 years old?"
00:36:21.792,00:36:24.458,Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.
00:36:24.458,00:36:26.959,What--?
00:36:26.959,00:36:38.917,"Look, Skyler, ...I just haven't quite been myself lately."
00:36:38.917,00:36:41.959,Yeah. No shit.
00:36:41.959,00:36:46.583,"I haven't been myself lately, but I love you."
00:36:46.583,00:36:50.041,Nothing about that has changed.
00:36:50.041,00:36:52.583,Nothing ever will.
00:36:52.583,00:37:00.250,"So right now, what I need is for you to climb down out of my ass."
00:37:03.041,00:37:05.458,Can you do that?
00:37:05.458,00:37:07.417,"Will you do that for me, honey?"
00:37:07.417,00:37:12.875,"Will you please, just once, get off my ass?"
00:37:12.875,00:37:14.792,You know.
00:37:14.792,00:37:19.709,I'd appreciate it.
00:37:38.834,00:37:40.917,Stop.
00:37:51.834,00:37:54.625,Stop in-- In 15 minutes.
00:38:21.250,00:38:23.750,Your face is too sharp.
00:38:28.750,00:38:31.208,Powder. Powder!
00:38:31.208,00:38:33.250,"SHEMP: Take a powder, go on."
00:38:36.875,00:38:39.500,MOE: Nice. Beautiful talcum powder.
00:38:39.500,00:38:41.792,"Lucky you, number eight."
00:38:44.750,00:38:47.834,"Just meat, it's all just-- Just a bunch of meat."
00:38:54.417,00:38:56.166,"Oh, Jesus."
00:39:00.542,00:39:02.667,"You're cool, you're cool."
00:39:02.667,00:39:06.917,"You're all good, you're all-- You're all good. You know it."
00:39:06.917,00:39:09.375,It's fine.
00:39:09.375,00:39:11.667,Come on. You're good.
00:39:34.000,00:39:35.917,Excuse me.
00:39:37.083,00:39:40.125,"Excuse me. You. Yes, you."
00:39:40.125,00:39:42.208,May I talk to you?
00:39:44.834,00:39:46.583,"Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey."
00:39:46.583,00:39:47.792,This is private property.
00:39:47.792,00:39:49.583,Just a minute.
00:39:49.583,00:39:50.750,"No, no, not interested."
00:39:50.750,00:39:52.375,Come on.
00:39:52.375,00:39:54.917,Do not touch me.
00:39:54.917,00:39:57.625,"All right, all right, look, not touching, okay? Not touching."
00:39:57.625,00:40:00.375,"Look, lady, whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, yo."
00:40:00.375,00:40:03.333,"Well, my name is Skyler White, yo."
00:40:03.333,00:40:05.625,"My husband is Walter White, yo."
00:40:07.208,00:40:08.542,Uh-huh.
00:40:08.542,00:40:10.125,He told me everything.
00:40:10.125,00:40:11.834,Seriously?
00:40:11.834,00:40:13.417,That's right.
00:40:13.417,00:40:22.333,"And just so you know, my brother-in-law is a DEA agent and I will not hesitate to call him."
00:40:22.333,00:40:25.750,Not if I have to.
00:40:25.750,00:40:30.083,This is your one and only warning.
00:40:30.083,00:40:34.500,Do not sell marijuana to my husband.
00:40:36.375,00:40:38.417,Okay.
00:40:38.417,00:40:40.667,Don't call our house again.
00:40:40.667,00:40:44.417,"You stay away from him, or you will be one sorry individual."
00:40:46.166,00:40:47.458,You get me?
00:40:47.458,00:40:50.333,"I-- I, uh, think so, yeah."
00:40:50.333,00:40:52.834,"Um, no more marijuana."
00:40:52.834,00:40:54.834,I can-- I can dig it.
00:40:54.834,00:40:58.291,You can dig it. Wonderful.
00:41:07.500,00:41:14.458,"Not that it's any of my business, but you might wanna consider a different line of work."
00:41:14.458,00:41:16.709,Okay.
00:42:10.375,00:42:12.333,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:42:12.333,00:42:14.291,"Let's go to your house, you know."
00:42:14.291,00:42:16.000,Makes perfect sense.
00:42:16.000,00:42:18.542,"Let's, uh..."
00:42:18.542,00:42:23.875,...let's completely screw up your house so you never wanna spend another night in it.
00:42:23.875,00:42:26.583,"Sure. You know, why not?"
00:42:31.208,00:42:37.750,"Yeah, and how's about I send over my psycho-bitch wife to, uh, you know, break your balls and threaten you?"
00:42:37.750,00:42:39.834,"God, that would be hilarious, you know."
00:42:39.834,00:42:49.083,"And then, you know, the killer in the basement, the one who's completely my responsibility, hell, let's just let him live down there."
00:42:49.083,00:42:54.917,"Just, I don't know, make sure to feed him, like, three times a day."
00:42:56.625,00:42:59.458,"Sure, why not?"
00:42:59.458,00:43:01.166,Thank you so much for the opportunity.
00:43:01.166,00:43:04.959,"I always dreamt about, I don't know, melting bodies."
00:43:29.000,00:43:31.875,You got a brother in the goddamn DEA?
00:43:35.083,00:43:36.583,What?
00:43:36.583,00:43:38.417,You said you were just doing some ride-along.
00:43:38.417,00:43:41.542,"Yes or no, do you have a brother in the DEA?"
00:43:42.625,00:43:43.834,He's a brother-in-law.
00:43:43.834,00:43:46.875,"Oh, well, there's a load off my mind."
00:43:46.875,00:43:48.375,Where did you hear that?
00:43:48.375,00:43:52.458,Your freaking wife told me when she was here all up in my shit.
00:43:52.458,00:43:53.750,"Yeah, that's right."
00:43:53.750,00:43:56.458,She almost caught me moving Emilio.
00:43:56.458,00:43:59.792,Good job on wearing the pants in the family.
00:43:59.792,00:44:03.000,And why'd you go and tell her I was selling you weed?
00:44:04.542,00:44:11.000,Because somehow it seemed preferable to admitting that I cook crystal meth and killed a man.
00:44:20.125,00:44:21.750,Is that what I think it is?
00:44:21.750,00:44:23.208,"Yeah. Yeah, it is."
00:44:23.208,00:44:25.709,So what?
00:44:25.709,00:44:27.959,"Hey, no, no."
00:44:27.959,00:44:31.208,I held up my end.
00:44:31.208,00:44:33.750,You're still diddling around trying to get your nut up.
00:44:33.750,00:44:35.625,"Yeah, well, boo-hoo."
00:44:35.625,00:44:37.500,I have the truly awful job here.
00:44:37.500,00:44:39.792,"Oh, you wanna-- You wanna talk awful? You wanna go there?"
00:44:39.792,00:44:44.291,Try dragging 200 pounds of stink up a flight of stairs.
00:44:44.291,00:44:46.625,I barely got him in the bathtub.
00:44:46.625,00:44:49.875,"Bathtub, what...?"
00:44:49.875,00:44:51.542,"You know, and that's another thing."
00:44:51.542,00:44:57.917,Why you got me running around town trying to find some stupid piece of plastic when I have a perfectly good tub I can use?
00:45:01.667,00:45:05.000,"Oh, God."
00:45:05.000,00:45:06.834,Hey. Hey.
00:46:01.458,00:46:05.166,"I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes."
00:46:05.166,00:46:09.625,That stupid plastic container I asked you to buy.
00:46:09.625,00:46:13.417,"You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic."
00:46:13.417,00:46:20.125,"It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic."
00:46:20.125,00:46:22.125,So there's that.
00:46:55.458,00:46:56.959,Here I go.
00:00:44.583,00:00:45.917,WALT: Let's break it down.
00:00:48.000,00:00:50.750,Hydrogen.
00:00:50.792,00:00:53.709,"By mole, we're looking at 63 percent."
00:00:53.750,00:00:55.792,Sixty-three? Wow.
00:00:55.834,00:00:57.709,That is a big bite.
00:00:57.750,00:01:00.917,My next step's gotta be oxygen.
00:01:00.959,00:01:03.333,Twenty-six.
00:01:03.375,00:01:06.834,"Carbon, 9 percent."
00:01:06.875,00:01:10.041,For a total of 98 percent.
00:01:10.083,00:01:12.667,"WOMAN: Nitrogen, 1.25 percent."
00:01:12.709,00:01:14.417,WALTER: One-point-two-five.
00:01:14.458,00:01:16.959,WOMAN: That brings you to 99 and a quarter.
00:01:17.000,00:01:23.041,Which only leaves you with the trace elements down where the magic happens.
00:01:23.083,00:01:26.709,"Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium? Calcium's not a trace."
00:01:26.750,00:01:28.875,WALTER: Got a whole skeleton to account for.
00:01:28.917,00:01:30.875,"WOMAN: You would think, right?"
00:01:30.917,00:01:34.625,WOMAN: Calcium.
00:01:34.667,00:01:37.333,What? That low?
00:01:37.375,00:01:39.375,Seriously?
00:01:39.417,00:01:41.375,"Damn, I never would've thought that."
00:01:41.417,00:01:46.291,"Okay, so where does iron fit in?"
00:01:46.333,00:01:53.625,"WOMAN: Wow, okay, 0.00004 percent."
00:01:53.667,00:01:57.542,What? You can't have hemoglobin without iron.
00:01:57.583,00:02:00.625,"Apparently, it don't take much."
00:02:00.667,00:02:02.417,"WALTER: Ah, sodium."
00:02:02.458,00:02:05.125,"WOMAN: Sodium, 0.04."
00:02:06.417,00:02:09.208,"WOMAN: Phosphorus, 0.19."
00:02:09.250,00:02:12.041,Point-one-nine.
00:02:12.083,00:02:13.875,There we go.
00:02:13.917,00:02:20.000,So the whole thing adds up to...
00:02:20.041,00:02:24.500,99.888042 percent.
00:02:26.792,00:02:34.709,We are 0.111958 percent shy.
00:02:34.750,00:02:37.542,Supposedly that's everything.
00:02:37.583,00:02:40.166,Mm-hm.
00:02:40.208,00:02:41.792,"I don't know, it just..."
00:02:41.834,00:02:43.709,It just...
00:02:43.750,00:02:45.709,"It seems like something's missing, doesn't it?"
00:02:47.542,00:02:51.917,WALTER: There's got to be more to a human being than that.
00:03:22.375,00:03:24.208,I hate these shoes.
00:03:24.250,00:03:34.208,"Shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans, like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person, then take the bus home to my 16 cats."
00:03:34.250,00:03:37.709,Then why are you wearing them?
00:03:37.750,00:03:40.917,I like the support. My arches happen to be extremely archy.
00:03:44.041,00:03:45.583,"Yo, what's up?"
00:03:45.625,00:03:48.166,"Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes?"
00:03:48.208,00:03:49.917,"Thanks, bye."
00:03:51.500,00:03:53.667,I gotta go take this.
00:03:53.709,00:03:56.583,Ooh. Female?
00:03:57.667,00:03:59.834,Louis.
00:03:59.875,00:04:03.583,"Not like it's any of your business, though."
00:04:03.625,00:04:05.709,Just be quick about it.
00:04:05.750,00:04:10.458,"Oh, and, um, please don't say, Yo."
00:04:10.500,00:04:13.125,You can't know how much I hate that.
00:04:18.208,00:04:21.959,"You missed a spot, right there."
00:04:22.000,00:04:24.000,Should you be up on that ladder?
00:04:24.041,00:04:26.792,You're more than welcome to take over for me up here.
00:04:26.834,00:04:28.834,I don't see why you don't get Walt to do it.
00:04:28.875,00:04:32.625,"Yeah, there's an idea."
00:04:34.542,00:04:43.542,"So um, I'm, uh, I'm working on this new short story and there's this stoner character in it and I'm trying to...um..."
00:04:43.583,00:04:44.959,"Well, you know, actually, let me back up."
00:04:45.000,00:04:51.333,"Um, you, uh, you smoked your fair share of pot in college, didn't you?"
00:04:53.166,00:04:56.250,"I mean, you at least tried it."
00:04:57.834,00:04:59.917,Come on.
00:05:02.041,00:05:06.417,I perhaps tried it. Why?
00:05:06.458,00:05:08.667,Do you remember it having an effect on your mood?
00:05:08.709,00:05:10.792,"Like, changing it in any major way?"
00:05:10.834,00:05:13.792,It made me more serious.
00:05:13.834,00:05:15.834,Really?
00:05:15.875,00:05:21.000,"Because I mostly remember it made me lightheaded, that's about it."
00:05:21.041,00:05:25.917,"I was just wondering if-- If it maybe could, um..."
00:05:27.875,00:05:33.709,"Um, you know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on. Never mind."
00:05:33.750,00:05:36.834,Walter Jr.'s on pot?
00:05:36.875,00:05:38.917,No. No.
00:05:38.959,00:05:41.333,What would make you even--?
00:05:41.375,00:05:42.583,Marie.
00:05:42.625,00:05:44.834,Seriously.
00:05:46.667,00:05:49.625,"Marie, you need to look me in the eye."
00:05:49.667,00:05:53.667,"I am strictly asking about a story that I'm writing, that's all."
00:05:53.709,00:06:02.333,"Right hand to God, Walter Jr. is not on pot, certainly not as far as I know."
00:06:02.375,00:06:04.709,Not as far as you know?
00:06:04.750,00:06:07.000,Marie.
00:07:55.834,00:07:58.875,"Hey, turn around and look at me."
00:08:03.542,00:08:07.709,This... This here.
00:08:07.750,00:08:10.750,I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.
00:08:12.625,00:08:15.417,This is degrading.
00:08:18.917,00:08:21.792,I'm sorry.
00:08:21.834,00:08:25.083,"You hope I'll make it easy and just drop dead, don't you?"
00:08:26.333,00:08:28.166,But I won't.
00:08:28.208,00:08:31.000,"So either kill me, or let me go."
00:08:32.250,00:08:34.792,"You don't have it in you, Walter."
00:08:38.625,00:08:40.333,How do you know my name?
00:08:41.667,00:08:43.792,Jesse.
00:08:43.834,00:08:46.000,He told Emilio and me.
00:08:46.041,00:08:49.333,I came by to sell your meth.
00:08:50.583,00:08:53.500,"So, what, did you threaten him, huh?"
00:08:53.542,00:08:56.333,Did you beat it out of him?
00:08:59.834,00:09:02.166,What else did he tell you?
00:09:03.625,00:09:06.166,Pretty much everything he could think of.
00:09:06.208,00:09:08.750,You were his high-school teacher.
00:09:08.792,00:09:14.291,One time you taught about carbon dioxide by making grape soda in class.
00:09:14.333,00:09:18.166,"You have a son who's retarded, or in a wheelchair or something."
00:09:20.667,00:09:23.625,It shouldn't come across as some news flash.
00:09:23.667,00:09:27.417,"That partner of yours, he's got a big mouth."
00:09:28.834,00:09:39.041,"Walter, I don't know what you think you're doing here, but trust me this line of work doesn't suit you."
00:09:40.291,00:09:43.792,"So I should just let you go, then?"
00:09:43.834,00:09:48.709,"Just unlock you and adiós, huh?"
00:09:48.750,00:09:51.750,I don't see what real choice you have.
00:09:51.792,00:09:55.208,If it's between that and cold-blooded murder.
00:09:55.250,00:09:58.000,Besides...
00:09:58.041,00:10:00.000,your real problem's sitting upstairs.
00:10:19.709,00:10:21.125,Occupied.
00:10:21.166,00:10:24.333,"Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here."
00:10:24.375,00:10:26.875,"Just give me some privacy, would you?"
00:10:29.083,00:10:31.959,Okay.
00:10:33.542,00:10:34.834,"What are you doing, man?"
00:10:34.875,00:10:37.750,You asshole. What--?
00:10:37.792,00:10:40.291,"Says who, him?"
00:10:40.333,00:10:42.750,You told him about my son.
00:10:42.792,00:10:45.542,Damn junkie.
00:10:45.583,00:10:47.834,This is going down the toilet.
00:10:47.875,00:10:50.000,"No, that's worth 40 grand, you stupid shit."
00:10:50.041,00:10:52.625,It's worth nothing when you smoke it all.
00:10:52.667,00:10:54.709,Get off the toilet.
00:10:54.750,00:10:56.917,Get off the toilet!
00:10:58.667,00:11:01.959,Get off the toilet.
00:11:02.000,00:11:04.542,Stop it.
00:11:07.709,00:11:09.166,No. No way.
00:11:43.333,00:11:44.792,No.
00:11:44.834,00:11:46.834,"No, no, no."
00:11:46.875,00:11:49.792,"Jesse, where the hell do you think you're going?"
00:11:49.834,00:11:51.583,"Back off, man. Jesus."
00:11:51.625,00:11:52.959,We've got work to do.
00:11:53.000,00:11:55.750,You-- You got work to do.
00:11:55.792,00:11:58.333,You mean that obscenity I spent the last two hours cleaning up?
00:11:58.375,00:12:01.542,That is your contribution?
00:12:01.583,00:12:03.417,I didn't ask for any of this.
00:12:03.458,00:12:05.417,"How am I supposed to live here now, huh?"
00:12:05.458,00:12:07.875,My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.
00:12:07.917,00:12:10.875,Because you didn't follow my instructions.
00:12:10.917,00:12:13.000,"Oh, well, Heil Hitler, bitch."
00:12:13.041,00:12:15.417,And let me tell you something else.
00:12:15.458,00:12:18.500,"We flipped a coin, okay?"
00:12:18.542,00:12:21.166,You and me. You and me.
00:12:21.208,00:12:23.625,Coin flip is sacred.
00:12:33.417,00:12:38.875,Your job is waiting for you in that basement as per the coin.
00:12:38.917,00:12:40.834,"Fucking do it, already."
00:12:54.625,00:12:58.083,That's what she said.
00:12:58.125,00:13:00.792,"Yeah. Yeah, I think we have some of those."
00:13:00.834,00:13:02.834,"Yeah, you'll have to try 'em on."
00:13:02.875,00:13:04.208,Hello?
00:13:04.250,00:13:06.583,I don't know.
00:13:06.625,00:13:07.792,Do you have these in black?
00:13:07.834,00:13:09.917,Mm-mm.
00:13:09.959,00:13:14.834,"Anyways, so like I was saying I went to the party the other night. Yeah, Tony was there."
00:13:19.041,00:13:20.750,Whatever.
00:13:20.792,00:13:23.417,"Hey, where have you been?"
00:13:23.458,00:13:26.000,"HANK: Sorry, baby, I'm, uh, kind of busy here. What's up?"
00:13:26.041,00:13:30.709,"Well, kind of a lot, actually, and it's a delicate subject."
00:13:30.750,00:13:35.625,"So I need you to focus, and-- Hey, sit down! Sit down!"
00:13:35.667,00:13:37.875,"Damn it, Hank."
00:13:37.917,00:13:40.750,"I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle of something here."
00:13:40.792,00:13:42.834,Get down. Get down.
00:13:42.875,00:13:46.792,"Sit down! Sit your ass down, comprende? You too, sit down!"
00:13:49.875,00:13:51.083,Shit.
00:13:51.125,00:13:52.917,"I'm back, babe. What's up?"
00:13:54.166,00:13:58.041,Walter Jr.
00:13:58.083,00:14:01.458,Marijuana. He's smoking it.
00:14:01.500,00:14:03.750,"Excuse me, his own mother seems to think so."
00:14:03.792,00:14:06.000,Skyler told you that?
00:14:06.041,00:14:08.542,"She inferred it, huh?"
00:14:08.583,00:14:10.834,She strongly inferred it.
00:14:10.875,00:14:16.208,"Like, Doctor, my friend suffers from erectile dysfunction."
00:14:16.250,00:14:18.291,"Please, come on."
00:14:18.333,00:14:20.291,I want you to talk to him.
00:14:20.333,00:14:22.750,"Hell, Skyler, better yet."
00:14:22.792,00:14:24.750,I think it ought to be you.
00:14:24.792,00:14:27.375,"You know, tell him some horror stories."
00:14:27.417,00:14:30.083,Maybe show him some autopsy pictures.
00:14:30.125,00:14:31.834,An autopsy of a pot overdose?
00:14:31.875,00:14:37.917,"I don't know, baby, it's just that, you know, I figure his dad should be the one doing this, don't you think?"
00:14:37.959,00:14:40.500,"Hank, he respects you."
00:14:43.792,00:14:45.959,"Yeah, all right."
00:14:43.792,00:14:47.625,"Well, listen, I mean, I'll swing by their place after work."
00:14:47.667,00:14:50.667,Good. Scare him straight.
00:14:50.709,00:14:52.333,"Hey, where's my sugar?"
00:14:56.875,00:14:58.750,"SALESWOMAN: Excuse me, ma'am."
00:14:58.792,00:15:02.250,"Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies before you try those on."
00:15:02.291,00:15:04.792,I'm extremely clean.
00:15:04.834,00:15:07.709,"Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it."
00:15:09.291,00:15:12.458,"Hey, sorry about that."
00:15:12.500,00:15:15.875,"SALESWOMAN: You know, I hid a pair for you last week, gray ones."
00:15:15.917,00:15:19.041,My manager found them and we put them back on the floor.
00:15:19.083,00:15:21.166,I know.
00:16:02.375,00:16:03.917,Hey.
00:16:03.959,00:16:05.625,I'm going.
00:16:07.208,00:16:10.291,HANK: What do you think?
00:16:11.375,00:16:12.834,This look like a nice place?
00:16:12.875,00:16:15.750,"No, not really."
00:16:15.792,00:16:17.792,Think you'd like to live here?
00:16:17.834,00:16:20.250,No.
00:16:20.291,00:16:22.834,Sure about that?
00:16:22.875,00:16:26.542,I thought we were going to Cold Stone Creamery.
00:16:26.583,00:16:29.375,"Yeah, yeah, well, we took a little detour."
00:16:29.417,00:16:32.250,Figure we'll come over and check out how the other half lives.
00:16:32.291,00:16:34.792,This here is what we call the Crystal Palace.
00:16:34.834,00:16:37.875,You know who lives in the palace? Meth-heads.
00:16:37.917,00:16:45.333,"Nasty, skeevy meth-heads who'd sell their grandma's coochie for a hit."
00:16:45.375,00:16:47.750,"Oh, you think that's funny?"
00:16:47.792,00:16:50.208,Let me tell you something.
00:16:47.792,00:16:53.250,Every one of these miserable wastes of skin got started how?
00:16:53.291,00:16:54.709,Hm?
00:16:54.750,00:16:57.250,How do you think they started?
00:16:57.291,00:17:03.000,What do you think they were doing before they graduated to shooting meth in their dicks?
00:17:04.834,00:17:06.834,A gateway drug.
00:17:06.875,00:17:08.625,That's what we call it.
00:17:15.125,00:17:17.291,You understand?
00:17:17.333,00:17:20.750,So why are you telling me this?
00:17:20.792,00:17:23.917,"Because I love you, you little bastard."
00:17:23.959,00:17:27.667,"And, hey, I was young once, you know."
00:17:27.709,00:17:30.709,"The world's a messed-up place, you know."
00:17:30.750,00:17:34.083,"You know, just this, uh, one time, you know..."
00:17:34.125,00:17:37.291,"Hey! Hey! Hey, you!"
00:17:37.333,00:17:41.542,"Yeah, you, princess."
00:17:43.750,00:17:46.709,"Hey, don't make me get out of the car."
00:17:50.834,00:17:52.250,Check this out.
00:17:52.291,00:17:55.458,See what I'm talking about.
00:17:55.500,00:17:57.834,"Hey, I ain't holding, okay?"
00:17:57.875,00:18:00.041,And hands off the car.
00:18:00.083,00:18:04.333,"Other side. Go around the other side, talk to my friend here."
00:18:06.750,00:18:08.917,"What's your name, sweetheart?"
00:18:10.208,00:18:12.166,Wendy.
00:18:12.208,00:18:14.625,"How much you charge for a windy, Wendy?"
00:18:14.667,00:18:17.875,"I ain't doing him, he's a kid."
00:18:17.917,00:18:20.750,"Don't think so hard, it's gonna hurt your brain."
00:18:20.792,00:18:22.458,Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
00:18:22.500,00:18:24.333,Nothing. Neither.
00:18:24.375,00:18:26.417,"HANK: Yeah, yeah."
00:18:26.458,00:18:28.792,"Come on, Wendy, let's see those pearly whites."
00:18:31.083,00:18:35.083,"Oh, God. See that?"
00:18:35.125,00:18:36.959,"HANK: Bigtime, bigtime on the pipe."
00:18:37.000,00:18:38.583,You got something you wanna ask Wendy?
00:18:38.625,00:18:40.917,"Um, no, not really."
00:18:40.959,00:18:43.458,"HANK: You ever smoke anything else, Wendy?"
00:18:43.500,00:18:45.417,Sausages don't count.
00:18:47.458,00:18:50.625,"Seriously, tell my friend here how you got started."
00:18:50.667,00:18:52.959,"HANK: Probably used to be, what?"
00:18:50.667,00:18:54.792,"Like a Girl Scout, or probably sang in the church choir."
00:18:54.834,00:18:56.417,"What are you, like, handicapped?"
00:18:56.458,00:18:58.959,He broke his leg playing football.
00:18:59.000,00:19:02.917,He's a qb.
00:19:04.083,00:19:07.166,"So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?"
00:19:07.208,00:19:08.709,"Why, you got some?"
00:19:08.750,00:19:11.417,"All right, hoof it, get lost."
00:19:11.458,00:19:14.542,"Hey, fair warning, next time I'm gonna bust you."
00:19:21.959,00:19:23.792,"So, what do you think?"
00:19:25.375,00:19:26.917,Cool.
00:19:35.834,00:19:37.667,JESSE: Shut the door.
00:19:37.709,00:19:40.542,Lock it.
00:19:40.583,00:19:41.834,Who the hell was that?
00:19:41.875,00:19:44.709,Cop and some football player messing with me.
00:19:44.750,00:19:47.166,"They ask about me, huh?"
00:19:47.208,00:19:50.000,"No, I think they just wanted pot."
00:20:03.583,00:20:06.208,Right there.
00:20:06.250,00:20:09.375,"Shit, I left my root beer."
00:20:58.417,00:21:01.709,SKYLER: Hello?
00:21:01.750,00:21:03.625,"Listen, I'm so sorry."
00:21:03.667,00:21:07.375,"The time, it just, ha, it just-- It completely got away from me."
00:21:07.417,00:21:09.917,"I'm just, ha...uh..."
00:21:09.959,00:21:13.917,"My fault, my fault."
00:21:09.959,00:21:20.834,"Bogdan just kept me here late, you know, doing some inventory, and I, um, I-- I should've just-- You know, you're right."
00:21:20.875,00:21:24.792,"I-I gotta learn to say, you know, No."
00:21:24.834,00:21:27.083,"But, um..."
00:21:28.208,00:21:30.709,Sky? You there?
00:21:31.959,00:21:34.959,You're at the car wash?
00:21:35.000,00:21:37.291,Yeah.
00:21:37.333,00:21:42.917,"I seriously doubt that, since you quit two weeks ago."
00:21:48.083,00:21:52.583,"I called Bogdan, looking for you."
00:21:52.625,00:21:54.917,Quite an earful he gave me.
00:21:56.834,00:22:00.458,Listen...
00:22:00.500,00:22:02.834,"Listen, I'll come home and we'll talk about it."
00:22:04.125,00:22:06.792,"I don't think so, Walt."
00:22:06.834,00:22:11.959,"Wherever you are, why don't you just stay there tonight?"
00:22:12.000,00:22:15.583,Skyler? Skyler?
00:22:17.166,00:22:18.917,Skyler?
00:22:20.834,00:22:22.792,MAN: Walter?
00:22:22.834,00:22:24.500,Hello?
00:22:24.542,00:22:27.250,"Hey, I'm kind of hungry down here."
00:23:48.250,00:23:50.417,Oh.
00:24:05.250,00:24:07.917,Come on.
00:24:28.834,00:24:31.125,Damn.
00:24:31.166,00:24:33.917,I didn't think you were coming back.
00:24:47.834,00:24:50.792,How long was I out?
00:24:50.834,00:24:52.500,"Ten, 15 minutes?"
00:24:54.583,00:24:58.125,I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing.
00:24:58.166,00:25:00.709,You breathe in the same shit you used on me?
00:25:09.375,00:25:10.959,I've got lung cancer.
00:25:35.542,00:25:37.959,I'll go make you another sandwich.
00:26:14.834,00:26:17.667,It's safe.
00:26:17.709,00:26:19.667,There's no poison.
00:26:22.750,00:26:27.667,Because that would be the way to do it if you're gonna do it.
00:26:28.875,00:26:31.583,I suppose it would.
00:26:31.625,00:26:35.500,"I mean, you being a chemist and all."
00:26:52.834,00:26:56.959,So that name...
00:26:57.000,00:26:59.792,Krazy-8.
00:26:59.834,00:27:01.834,Do I really have to call you that?
00:27:01.875,00:27:07.125,"I mean, no offense, but don't you have a real name?"
00:27:08.458,00:27:10.667,Domingo.
00:27:10.709,00:27:12.875,Domingo.
00:27:12.917,00:27:16.000,"That's Sunday, right?"
00:27:18.542,00:27:22.125,"I'd rather call you that, if you don't mind."
00:27:23.125,00:27:24.750,Whatever.
00:27:24.792,00:27:27.542,I can't say I ever liked it much.
00:27:30.750,00:27:38.208,"So, Domingo, you from around town here or someplace else?"
00:27:38.250,00:27:40.792,"Hey, Walter?"
00:27:38.250,00:27:43.917,You getting to know me is not gonna make it easier for you to kill me.
00:27:43.959,00:27:45.917,"Not that I mind, you understand?"
00:27:48.458,00:27:51.834,"You know, you keep telling me that I don't have it in me."
00:27:51.875,00:27:53.875,"Well, maybe."
00:27:53.917,00:27:56.041,But maybe not.
00:27:59.250,00:28:02.208,I sure as hell am looking for any reason not to.
00:28:02.250,00:28:05.750,"I mean, any good reason at all."
00:28:11.750,00:28:13.834,Sell me.
00:28:13.875,00:28:16.291,Tell me what it is.
00:28:25.959,00:28:30.750,I guess I'd say what happened between us never happened.
00:28:30.792,00:28:34.125,And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it.
00:28:34.166,00:28:38.792,But you know that anybody in my situation would make promises like that.
00:28:38.834,00:28:41.166,"And, in my case, they happen to be true."
00:28:41.208,00:28:42.917,You'll never know for sure.
00:28:46.834,00:28:49.000,"So, what else can I tell you?"
00:28:54.875,00:28:56.709,I don't know.
00:28:58.208,00:29:01.667,But you've gotta convince me.
00:29:01.709,00:29:06.000,And you're going nowhere until you do.
00:29:06.041,00:29:09.500,"Hey, yeah. Yeah."
00:29:09.542,00:29:12.250,"I'm from here in town, man."
00:29:12.291,00:29:14.834,"ABQ, born and bred."
00:29:14.875,00:29:17.583,Never left.
00:29:17.625,00:29:23.709,"Studied Business Administration over at UNM, got my degree."
00:29:23.750,00:29:25.291,Really?
00:29:27.792,00:29:31.667,"Does that, uh, come in handy in the drug trade?"
00:29:31.709,00:29:34.333,It doesn't hurt.
00:29:34.375,00:29:37.625,I was gonna study music originally.
00:29:37.667,00:29:40.208,Maybe even try out for Oberlin and Berklee.
00:29:40.250,00:29:43.709,My pops talked me out of it.
00:29:43.750,00:29:50.667,"Said there was no money in it unless I wind up some bullshit rock star, and I didn't have a snowball chance of that."
00:29:51.959,00:29:54.083,What does your dad do?
00:29:54.125,00:29:58.625,He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.
00:29:58.667,00:30:02.041,"Wait a minute, I know that place."
00:30:04.792,00:30:06.834,Wait a minute. That's...
00:30:06.875,00:30:09.417,"That's that-- That, uh..."
00:30:09.458,00:30:14.625,They used to have those-- Those late-night-- The stupid commercials.
00:30:14.667,00:30:17.667,"Yeah, that's him. Been doing them for over 30 years."
00:30:17.709,00:30:21.834,Wait a minute.
00:30:21.875,00:30:25.625,"Wait, wait, wait. It was..."
00:30:25.667,00:30:55.041,Don't let shopping Strain your brain-o Just sing this short refrain-o Our furniture is bueno Our furniture is bueno Tampico is the name-o Tampico is the name-o Pretty moronic.
00:30:55.083,00:30:58.750,"Well, it did tend to stick in your head."
00:30:58.792,00:31:03.000,Did you write that? Being the musician in the family.
00:31:03.041,00:31:07.083,"Hell, no, man."
00:31:07.125,00:31:09.458,"He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women."
00:31:10.750,00:31:20.041,"His mind, it's like saying, Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven.' Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I..."
00:31:20.083,00:31:24.667,I think when my son was born that we bought his bassinet there.
00:31:24.709,00:31:26.792,DOMINGO: Mm-mm.
00:31:26.834,00:31:29.166,It's more of a specialty item.
00:31:29.208,00:31:32.709,We did use to sell cribs.
00:31:32.750,00:31:35.291,"A crib, then, okay. A crib."
00:31:35.333,00:31:37.709,"Yeah. No, I remember that."
00:31:37.750,00:31:44.125,"In fact, I remember recognizing your dad from those commercials."
00:31:44.166,00:31:47.291,Although he wasn't anywhere near as friendly in real life.
00:31:47.333,00:31:49.709,Yeah. No shit.
00:31:49.750,00:31:52.083,"Did he, uh, try selling you that extended warranty?"
00:31:52.125,00:31:54.709,"Yeah, he probably did."
00:31:54.750,00:31:57.291,And I was probably dumb enough to buy it.
00:31:57.333,00:31:59.709,"Yeah, that was his big thing."
00:31:59.750,00:32:04.834,"You ask him for a glass of water, he'd tell you you need an extended warranty on the ice."
00:32:08.709,00:32:10.750,Did you work there too?
00:32:10.792,00:32:13.917,"Up until the day I said, Fuck you, and quit."
00:32:18.291,00:32:21.709,"So, uh..."
00:32:21.750,00:32:25.917,"16 years ago, how old would you have been?"
00:32:25.959,00:32:29.291,"If it was after school, trust me, I was there."
00:32:29.333,00:32:31.625,Might have even helped ring you up.
00:32:31.667,00:32:35.291,You and your extended warranty on the crib.
00:32:43.875,00:32:46.166,Small world.
00:32:46.208,00:32:48.959,It is.
00:32:50.458,00:32:53.375,"The paths we take, huh?"
00:33:18.458,00:33:20.959,Jesse know you've got cancer?
00:33:23.709,00:33:25.750,No one but you.
00:33:27.166,00:33:28.792,Not your family?
00:33:28.834,00:33:31.041,No.
00:33:31.083,00:33:33.000,Why not?
00:33:37.250,00:33:41.917,Not a conversation that I'm even remotely ready to have.
00:33:44.250,00:33:46.542,That's why you're cooking meth?
00:33:46.583,00:33:49.667,DOMINGO: You wanna leave money for your family.
00:33:51.750,00:33:56.792,"Hell, I mean, I'll write you a check right now if you let me go."
00:34:01.959,00:34:08.208,"Like I said, Walter, if this line of work doesn't suit you..."
00:34:21.166,00:34:23.917,I don't know what to do.
00:34:31.875,00:34:33.792,Yeah.
00:34:33.834,00:34:35.417,You do.
00:34:54.333,00:34:56.250,I'll get the key.
00:36:38.458,00:36:40.709,No.
00:36:40.750,00:36:42.792,No.
00:36:42.834,00:36:45.083,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:36:55.834,00:36:59.709,"No. No. No, don't do this."
00:36:59.750,00:37:03.709,Don't do this.
00:37:03.750,00:37:06.291,Why are you doing this?
00:37:39.667,00:37:41.625,"You're doing the right thing, Walter."
00:37:42.917,00:37:44.750,Yeah?
00:37:48.750,00:37:50.667,Do you wanna?
00:38:05.458,00:38:09.792,So you're not angry?
00:38:09.834,00:38:11.792,What do you mean?
00:38:14.250,00:38:15.959,No.
00:38:16.000,00:38:18.792,"Live and let live, man."
00:38:20.625,00:38:22.875,That's very understanding.
00:38:22.917,00:38:24.875,"Whatever, man."
00:38:24.917,00:38:27.125,I just wanna go home.
00:38:30.709,00:38:32.792,Yeah.
00:38:32.834,00:38:34.959,Me too.
00:38:42.709,00:38:44.625,"Unlock me, Walter."
00:39:04.291,00:39:07.834,are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate?
00:39:35.625,00:39:37.625,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
00:39:37.667,00:39:39.750,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."
00:39:39.792,00:39:41.792,I'm so sorry.
00:39:41.834,00:39:43.500,I'm sorry.
00:39:50.458,00:39:52.792,I'm sorry.
00:41:22.542,00:41:25.458,Hello?
00:41:25.500,00:41:27.917,Anybody down here?
00:42:35.250,00:42:40.959,"Everybody, I need you all to take your seats."
00:42:41.000,00:42:43.875,"Settle down, please. Thank you."
00:42:43.917,00:42:49.583,I understand that Mr. White is feeling a little under the weather this morning.
00:42:49.625,00:42:54.834,So you folks are going to have to be making do with me today.
00:42:54.875,00:43:03.333,And we are going to be watching a very interesting video on carbon.
00:43:03.375,00:43:04.792,Very important stuff.
00:43:07.625,00:43:09.417,"So, what do you think?"
00:43:09.458,00:43:11.750,"Ah, it's a cook site."
00:43:11.792,00:43:15.458,Nobody came way the hell out here just to buy.
00:43:15.500,00:43:18.375,Fire there could have started by accident.
00:43:18.417,00:43:21.792,I don't think that was meant to destroy evidence.
00:43:24.959,00:43:28.750,"So, what, they're in some sort of camper-slash-lab?"
00:43:28.792,00:43:31.583,They accidentally start a fire and everybody FOs?
00:43:31.625,00:43:33.709,Yeah. Why not?
00:43:33.750,00:43:36.917,So why did that little hair-gelled shit leave his car?
00:43:38.834,00:43:40.375,Ay-yi-yi.
00:43:40.417,00:43:43.125,"Gomey, it's a culture in decline."
00:43:43.166,00:43:44.834,It's a rich and vibrant culture.
00:43:44.875,00:43:47.834,It's a car that jumps up and down.
00:43:47.875,00:43:49.375,What the hell?
00:43:49.417,00:43:52.333,"You people used to be conquistadors, for chrissake."
00:43:52.375,00:43:57.000,Smells like a Drakkar Noir factory in here.
00:43:57.041,00:43:58.792,I already searched it.
00:43:58.834,00:44:01.083,Yeah.
00:44:04.834,00:44:07.417,Give it up.
00:44:04.834,00:44:09.834,"If this here's a trap car, it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it."
00:44:09.875,00:44:15.041,"Oh, yeah? You are talking to the trap-car master, my friend."
00:44:15.083,00:44:17.375,I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks.
00:44:17.417,00:44:20.625,"Yeah, you're like Rain Man."
00:44:27.500,00:44:29.667,"Yeah, baby."
00:44:33.750,00:44:36.166,"Hello, zippy."
00:44:36.208,00:44:41.000,"Sort of looks like meth but it's, uh, it's too damn white."
00:44:43.500,00:44:45.500,"You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?"
00:44:45.542,00:44:48.208,Yep.
00:44:48.250,00:44:49.917,"MAN: Hey, agents."
00:44:49.959,00:44:51.917,You got something?
00:45:26.750,00:45:29.333,WALTER: I don't know. It just...
00:45:29.375,00:45:34.834,It just... Doesn't it seem like something's missing?
00:45:34.875,00:45:37.125,What about the soul?
00:45:48.875,00:45:51.667,The soul.
00:45:58.583,00:46:02.333,There's nothing but chemistry here.
00:47:06.208,00:47:08.458,Skyler?
00:47:17.291,00:47:20.417,There's something I have to tell you.
00:00:02.834,00:00:06.333,HANK: Operation Icebreaker.
00:00:08.875,00:00:11.750,"How we liking that? We never used that before, did we?"
00:00:11.792,00:00:13.500,Isn't that the name of a breath mint?
00:00:13.542,00:00:14.959,What?
00:00:15.000,00:00:17.208,Breath mint?
00:00:17.250,00:00:20.583,Gonna be thinking about some ship in the North Pole breaking ice.
00:00:20.625,00:00:23.667,Says you. I'm gonna be thinking Operation Breath Mint.
00:00:23.709,00:00:27.625,I'm thinking Operation Breath Mint every time you and me are on a stakeout together.
00:00:27.667,00:00:30.709,Your breath can knock a buzzard off a shit wagon.
00:00:30.750,00:00:34.834,"All right, Operation TBD."
00:00:34.875,00:00:36.125,"Thanks for nothing, Gom."
00:00:36.166,00:00:40.750,"Anyway, say hello to Domingo Gallardo Molina."
00:00:40.792,00:00:44.875,A.k.a. Krazy-8. Way smarter than your average cheese eater.
00:00:44.917,00:00:49.709,"I turned him out when he was street, but this dude's like The Jeffersons, moving on up."
00:00:49.750,00:00:52.792,"Every dealer he'd throw at us, he'd end up snaking their customers."
00:00:52.834,00:00:55.834,"HANK: Now it turns out he's missing, presumed dead."
00:00:55.875,00:00:57.792,Found his car out in the boonies.
00:00:57.834,00:01:04.458,"Last guy he ratted out was none other than his cousin, Emilio Koyama."
00:01:04.500,00:01:06.625,You thinking the cousin found out and took revenge?
00:01:06.667,00:01:09.291,"HANK: Could be, turns out he's missing too."
00:01:09.333,00:01:12.792,And normally I'd say someone did the world a favor.
00:01:12.834,00:01:22.125,"But our snitch's car, turns out we find two grams of meth in it, we take it to the lab, they come back, they tell us it is the purest they've ever seen."
00:01:22.166,00:01:24.709,Ninety-nine-point-one percent.
00:01:24.750,00:01:27.417,Our chemist is blown away.
00:01:27.458,00:01:33.250,"Worse yet, it didn't come out of some super lab in Mexico, we're thinking this was cooked here in the Land of Enchantment."
00:01:33.291,00:01:36.834,Car was abandoned at what appears to be a cook site.
00:01:36.875,00:01:40.041,"This is the, uh, only other thing left behind."
00:01:40.083,00:01:43.208,"We're sending it off to Quantico, see if they can pull something off it."
00:01:43.250,00:01:48.625,"Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter element and found the same 99.1 meth."
00:01:49.875,00:01:52.041,So be on notice.
00:01:52.083,00:01:55.250,We got new players in town.
00:01:55.291,00:02:01.709,"Now, we don't know who they are, or where they come from, but they possess an extremely high skill set."
00:02:01.750,00:02:08.458,"Me, personally, I'm thinking Albuquerque just might have a new kingpin."
00:02:42.917,00:02:45.500,"Jesus, Walt, you're burning the shit out of 'em."
00:02:45.542,00:02:47.709,Oh. Damn it.
00:02:47.750,00:02:50.500,"Hey, Sky, you got any more chicken?"
00:02:50.542,00:02:52.750,Emeril here is gonna need a fresh pack.
00:02:52.792,00:02:54.625,Bam.
00:02:54.667,00:02:56.000,"HANK: All right, looking good."
00:02:56.041,00:02:58.792,Is this low-fat mayonnaise in the coleslaw?
00:02:58.834,00:03:02.458,"Uh, I-- I don't know, it's store-bought."
00:03:02.500,00:03:05.667,"Okay, uh, Hank, you need another beer?"
00:03:05.709,00:03:07.041,Does the pope shit in his hat?
00:03:07.083,00:03:12.667,"Yeah, I don't think that he does, Hank, and I think everybody would like it if you'd stop saying that."
00:03:12.709,00:03:14.000,"Marie, some more wine, maybe?"
00:03:14.041,00:03:15.291,"I'm all right, thanks."
00:03:15.333,00:03:16.917,All right.
00:03:16.959,00:03:20.250,"Yeah, I want Shania Twain to give me a tuggy."
00:03:20.291,00:03:22.417,Guess what.
00:03:22.458,00:03:23.834,"How about some more soda, hm?"
00:03:23.875,00:03:25.125,"Yeah, sure."
00:03:25.166,00:03:26.375,"Honey, do you need anything?"
00:03:26.417,00:03:27.834,"Mm-mm. No, Walt, thank you."
00:03:27.875,00:03:30.458,Okay. Be right back.
00:03:49.625,00:03:50.792,WALT JR.: No.
00:03:50.834,00:03:52.917,"What, are you kidding me?"
00:03:52.959,00:03:55.500,"You look like a damn movie star, man."
00:03:55.542,00:03:58.125,Girls gotta be lining up left and right.
00:03:59.875,00:04:01.667,He's adorable.
00:04:01.709,00:04:04.166,"He doesn't wanna be fricking adorable, he wants to be hot."
00:04:04.208,00:04:06.792,See what I'm talking about?
00:04:06.834,00:04:08.709,She's supposed to say that.
00:04:08.750,00:04:15.000,"HANK: Look, a guy doesn't gotta look like, uh, you know, Charlton Heston-- I'm talking Moses days."
00:04:15.041,00:04:16.792,"--to get a girl, all right?"
00:04:16.834,00:04:20.792,You just gotta have confidence.
00:04:20.834,00:04:23.583,"Confidence and, uh-- And persistence."
00:04:23.625,00:04:25.959,Okay? That's what I'm talking about.
00:04:26.000,00:04:28.792,"I chased your aunt Marie, here, all over creation."
00:04:28.834,00:04:31.667,"I kept bugging her for a date, she kept saying no."
00:04:31.709,00:04:33.458,"What, I asked you, like, 50 times?"
00:04:33.500,00:04:36.583,"Yeah, it was before they tightened the stalking laws."
00:04:38.458,00:04:42.583,"Anyway, how about your dad here?"
00:04:42.625,00:04:44.208,Tell him how you met Skyler.
00:04:44.250,00:04:51.709,WALT JR.: Mom was a waitress in Los Alamos and Dad said that thing to you.
00:04:51.750,00:05:01.792,"Well, actually, your mother wasn't a waitress, it was a summer job, and, um, she was the hostess and she also worked the cash register."
00:05:01.834,00:05:08.792,And I used to go in there a lot because it was close enough to the lab where I could ride my bicycle.
00:05:08.834,00:05:16.875,"And once I noticed her, it got to be so that I would only go in when I knew she was working."
00:05:16.917,00:05:24.750,"When it was slow, she would lean against the counter, doing her crossword puzzles, uh, but kind of hiding it."
00:05:24.792,00:05:33.792,"Right? Pretending that she was still working, and once I caught on to that, I would do crossword puzzles while I ate my grilled-cheese sandwich."
00:05:33.834,00:05:43.834,"It got so that every day at lunch, we would both be doing The New York Times crossword puzzle 10 feet from each other."
00:05:43.875,00:05:46.083,"And, uh-- Heh-heh."
00:05:46.125,00:06:01.709,"Eventually, I caught her looking over at me, so I began saying: Excuse me, um, 14 across, seven-letter word for whatchamacallit, uh, may I ask what--?"
00:06:01.750,00:06:03.500,What you wrote down?
00:06:03.542,00:06:11.208,"And, uh, well, that got us talking, and, uh, boy, I tell you, I was-- I was terrible at those puzzles."
00:06:12.875,00:06:16.291,I don't think that I finished even one of them.
00:06:16.333,00:06:19.750,But your mother would do them in ink.
00:06:19.792,00:06:21.000,HANK: Very smooth.
00:06:22.834,00:06:24.875,"I bet you didn't think your old man had it in him, huh?"
00:06:24.917,00:06:28.291,"But that's what I'm talking about, that's persistence, you see?"
00:06:28.333,00:06:33.792,"Once you set your cap for something or somebody, you gotta just, you know..."
00:06:35.291,00:06:37.792,Whoa. Skyler.
00:06:37.834,00:06:40.291,"Mom, a-are you all right?"
00:06:40.333,00:06:42.583,"MARIE: Hey, hey."
00:06:42.625,00:06:44.792,"Shh. Honey, it's okay."
00:06:44.834,00:06:46.792,What's the matter?
00:06:49.875,00:06:51.792,MARIE: What is it?
00:06:53.125,00:06:54.917,Ask him.
00:07:04.542,00:07:06.625,What's she talking about?
00:07:11.375,00:07:12.875,Walt?
00:07:15.166,00:07:16.875,Um...
00:07:19.959,00:07:23.500,I have cancer.
00:07:26.750,00:07:28.333,Lung cancer.
00:07:38.125,00:07:39.917,It's bad.
00:08:01.291,00:08:03.375,SKYLER: Ask him how long he's known.
00:08:04.959,00:08:07.375,"I guess a month, maybe."
00:08:07.417,00:08:09.166,"Oh, for God sakes, Walt."
00:08:09.208,00:08:12.458,We're just sitting out there having a cookout like nothing's going on.
00:08:12.500,00:08:15.083,He made me promise not to tell anybody.
00:08:15.125,00:08:18.792,"Christ, these last 48 hours."
00:08:18.834,00:08:23.959,"And it's the weekend, so I couldn't even get his doctor on the phone."
00:08:24.000,00:08:26.709,"Buddy, why--? I mean, why wouldn't you wanna tell anybody?"
00:08:26.750,00:08:32.750,"SKYLER: Walt, don't you see everybody just wants to help you."
00:08:32.792,00:08:36.750,We're family. We get through these things together.
00:08:36.792,00:08:40.291,"HANK: And I don't get, you know, lung cancer?"
00:08:40.333,00:08:43.000,How can that happen?
00:08:43.041,00:08:50.542,"You know, I'm thinking that this goes back 20 years, maybe, to the applications lab, all those chemicals they had you working around."
00:08:50.583,00:08:52.750,We-- We always took the proper precautions.
00:08:52.792,00:09:02.709,"One time you complained that they didn't give you the right kind of, um, I don't know, some kind of ventilation hood or something, and-- And-- And then the headaches."
00:09:02.750,00:09:05.375,How do they think they can get away with this?
00:09:05.417,00:09:07.250,We should hire a lawyer.
00:09:07.291,00:09:11.583,"Okay, so first let's deal with this."
00:09:11.625,00:09:15.792,"Okay, so, what's the next step for Walt?"
00:09:15.834,00:09:18.792,"Certainly a second opinion, right?"
00:09:18.834,00:09:21.709,"Right. Right, absolutely."
00:09:21.750,00:09:32.625,"MARIE: Okay, so first thing tomorrow, I talk to my radiologists, we find you the best, the oncology dream team."
00:09:32.667,00:09:34.834,That's good.
00:09:36.000,00:09:37.500,Yeah.
00:09:39.000,00:09:41.542,Yeah?
00:09:41.583,00:09:42.834,"Yeah, okay."
00:09:42.875,00:09:43.959,Yeah.
00:09:49.750,00:09:51.917,I'm gonna go check on Walt Jr.
00:09:51.959,00:09:59.125,"I, um-- I'm gonna see if I can talk him into, I don't know, joining us."
00:09:59.166,00:10:03.542,I really didn't mean for him to find out that way.
00:10:09.875,00:10:11.583,"Walt, uh..."
00:10:12.750,00:10:15.166,whatever happens...
00:10:15.208,00:10:28.792,"I hope this goes without saying, but, um, whatever happens, I want you to know that, um, I'll always take care of your family."
00:10:55.583,00:10:58.500,"JESSE: Yo, check out these, uh, fake Pop-Tarts."
00:10:58.542,00:11:01.417,"These are mad tight, yo."
00:11:01.458,00:11:05.333,"Your loss. These are from, like, Canada, or something. Imported."
00:11:07.709,00:11:09.458,"Did, like, the ceiling fall down, or...?"
00:11:09.500,00:11:14.917,"Oh, yeah, uh, no, man, I think the house is just settling."
00:11:14.959,00:11:17.458,"You know, it's been caving in left and right."
00:11:17.500,00:11:19.750,Hit me in the eye. Heh-heh.
00:11:19.792,00:11:20.834,It's bananas.
00:11:20.875,00:11:24.709,"Yo, my pops could fix you up, he's, like, a contractor or something."
00:11:24.750,00:11:27.750,"Yeah? Yeah, right on, I should grab that number."
00:11:27.792,00:11:30.250,"Say, Jesse, you still cook a little crystal?"
00:11:33.458,00:11:38.083,"Uh, could be, yeah."
00:11:38.125,00:11:41.083,I heard you lost your partner.
00:11:41.125,00:11:42.667,Emilio.
00:11:44.291,00:11:46.792,Didn't he get locked up?
00:11:46.834,00:11:48.041,His cousin bailed him out.
00:11:49.834,00:11:55.208,"I don't know about any of that, I've just been kind of doing my own thing these days, so..."
00:11:55.250,00:11:57.834,"But you maybe got some crystal, man?"
00:11:57.875,00:12:02.000,"'Cause I could seriously go for a bowl right now, you know, take the edge off."
00:12:02.041,00:12:04.792,"Hell, yeah, Sunday night bowl, yo."
00:12:04.834,00:12:06.583,All right.
00:12:08.792,00:12:16.917,"Well, uh, maybe it just so happens that, uh, I just recently cooked the best batch ever."
00:12:18.166,00:12:19.583,Yeah?
00:12:19.625,00:12:22.125,"Oh, yeah. Came up with this whole new recipe."
00:12:22.166,00:12:24.417,It's more like a formula.
00:12:24.458,00:12:31.625,"It's, like, way, way more chemically-- Shit, you know, it's-- It's just the bomb, so..."
00:12:33.375,00:12:41.750,"But, you know, I don't know, I've been thinking lately I'll just lay off of it for a while, 'cause lately it's been kind of making me paranoid, so..."
00:12:46.417,00:12:49.792,"You know, for, like, health-wise, just lay off."
00:12:49.834,00:12:54.333,"Yo, if you're, uh, not into sharing, man, just tell us to piss off, it's cool."
00:12:54.375,00:12:56.166,We don't need no soap opera.
00:12:56.208,00:12:57.542,"Yeah, man, whatever."
00:12:57.583,00:12:59.166,"No, no, it's all good, you know."
00:12:59.208,00:13:03.417,"I-I'm just saying, uh, hey, I got-- I got plenty of pot."
00:13:03.458,00:13:05.834,"Yeah, I think I'll bounce, man."
00:13:05.875,00:13:08.166,"Yeah, sounds about right."
00:13:08.208,00:13:12.792,"Hey, yo, yo."
00:13:12.834,00:13:15.875,"Okay, I'm totally joking with you."
00:13:15.917,00:13:18.750,You kidding? Sit down.
00:13:25.125,00:13:27.875,Best scante ever.
00:13:27.917,00:13:29.291,Grab that pipe.
00:16:22.542,00:16:25.000,"Okay, there."
00:16:30.959,00:16:32.917,Shit.
00:16:43.208,00:16:47.792,"SKYLER: Walt, do you need some help?"
00:16:49.041,00:16:50.792,"Oh, no, I'm-- I'm fine, honey."
00:16:50.834,00:16:54.583,"I'm fine. Just, uh, privacy."
00:16:54.625,00:16:56.709,Thanks.
00:16:58.417,00:17:01.500,SKYLER: I'm right outside if you need me.

00:17:09.875,00:17:12.542,"Yeah, any time on Friday is absolutely fine."
00:17:12.583,00:17:14.917,Thank you so much for working us in.
00:17:16.250,00:17:20.333,"Uh, can I just put that on a credit card?"
00:17:20.375,00:17:22.583,Great. Perfect.
00:17:22.625,00:17:27.792,"Okay, so we will see you at 10:45 on Friday morning."
00:17:27.834,00:17:30.667,Thank you so much.
00:17:30.709,00:17:32.291,Okay.
00:17:33.250,00:17:36.375,"Oh, yes."
00:17:36.417,00:17:51.166,"Honey, the best oncologist, I mean, not even just in New Mexico, but one of the top 10 in the entire nation, his name is, um, Dr. Delcavoli, and we see him on Friday."
00:17:52.500,00:17:53.750,Ah.
00:17:53.792,00:17:55.792,"I mean, Marie really came through for us."
00:17:55.834,00:17:57.917,"She had her boss call, and..."
00:18:00.875,00:18:04.959,"Okay, this is good."
00:18:05.000,00:18:09.792,"From here on out, I mean, things are gonna-- What's--? What's that we're putting on a credit card?"
00:18:09.834,00:18:13.333,"Uh, it's just a deposit kind of thing."
00:18:13.375,00:18:14.709,How much of a deposit?
00:18:14.750,00:18:17.667,It's $5000.
00:18:17.709,00:18:19.458,Five thousand?
00:18:21.875,00:18:23.792,Jesus.
00:18:26.458,00:18:27.792,"What's that, just to start?"
00:18:27.834,00:18:30.917,"I mean, just to tell me what I already know?"
00:18:33.834,00:18:36.542,"So be it, we'll figure it out."
00:18:37.834,00:18:41.667,"Come on, don't get hung up on money here."
00:18:41.709,00:18:43.667,We can always borrow from Hank.
00:18:43.709,00:18:45.333,Absolutely not.
00:18:47.834,00:18:49.542,"No, I just..."
00:18:49.583,00:18:50.834,We're not gonna do that.
00:18:52.083,00:18:53.917,"Well, maybe we can ask your mom."
00:18:56.417,00:18:58.500,Have you even called her yet?
00:19:04.458,00:19:07.792,"I'm willing to do it, but I-- I'll call. I'll call."
00:19:07.834,00:19:14.667,"Okay, look, I don't even want us thinking about money."
00:19:14.709,00:19:16.792,Money is not the issue here.
00:19:16.834,00:19:19.709,It's not.
00:19:21.875,00:19:23.291,It's not.
00:19:23.333,00:19:24.834,Okay.
00:19:24.875,00:19:27.291,Okay.
00:19:27.333,00:19:29.875,I'll take care of the deposit.
00:19:29.917,00:19:32.041,Yeah?
00:19:32.083,00:19:33.792,Yeah.
00:19:33.834,00:19:35.709,"I'll, uh..."
00:19:35.750,00:19:38.458,I'll borrow it from my pension.
00:20:08.208,00:20:10.291,"Oh, damn it!"
00:20:12.834,00:20:14.583,Hey. Heh-heh.
00:20:14.625,00:20:16.667,"Hey, pal, what's up?"
00:20:18.542,00:20:22.083,"Oh, uh, yeah, no, I thought I heard mice."
00:20:22.125,00:20:25.583,"Heh. Boy, that's-- That's all we need, huh?"
00:20:27.417,00:20:29.041,"So, what's up, pal?"
00:20:29.083,00:20:32.417,What the hell's wrong with you?
00:20:34.333,00:20:35.667,What?
00:20:35.709,00:20:39.000,You're-- You're acting all...
00:20:39.041,00:20:46.792,You're... You-- You're all...
00:20:46.834,00:20:48.333,Son.
00:20:46.834,00:20:50.917,You're-- You're acting like nothing is going on.
00:21:43.792,00:21:47.166,"Oh, no, please."
00:22:40.959,00:22:42.875,Hey!
00:22:42.917,00:22:44.417,"WALT: Oh, come on."
00:22:44.458,00:22:48.542,"Hey, am I--? Am I gonna have to come down there and whup your ass?"
00:23:01.709,00:23:05.333,"And let me tell you something else, I'm not doing this for charity, right?"
00:23:05.375,00:23:07.917,I'm the best he's got.
00:23:05.375,00:23:14.583,"He knows it, I know it I expect to be paid to a level commensurate with-- I said, Dave, do you think 40 grand is a proper bonus?"
00:23:14.625,00:23:17.709,That's less than 10 percent of what I booked this quarter.
00:23:17.750,00:23:22.500,"I'm not gonna sit here and be disrespect-- Oh, he's shitting bricks."
00:23:22.542,00:23:24.083,"Oh, you know he is."
00:23:24.125,00:23:26.792,"Yeah, that man lives in fear."
00:23:24.125,00:23:28.250,"I'll go across town-- Hell, I could go anywhere."
00:23:28.291,00:23:30.959,"Hoffman, Gordon Bradley, or Sorcher."
00:23:31.000,00:23:32.333,Even Goldberg-Wayne.
00:23:32.375,00:23:36.125,They'd make me a partner just for walking in the damn door that's how ecstatic they'd be.
00:23:37.709,00:23:40.500,"Hells, yes, brother man."
00:23:40.542,00:23:43.291,"Dude, you should check this chick out."
00:23:43.333,00:23:47.834,Who? No.
00:23:47.875,00:23:49.792,Stacey's a cow.
00:23:49.834,00:23:52.917,We're talking major barnyard boo-hog.
00:23:52.959,00:23:57.333,"Roll her in flour and look for the wet spot before you hit that, man, you know what I'm saying?"
00:23:57.375,00:23:59.834,That kind of stink does not wash off.
00:23:59.875,00:24:01.166,Sir?
00:24:01.208,00:24:02.834,MAN: Ha-ha-ha. Right.
00:24:02.875,00:24:05.417,Sir.
00:24:05.458,00:24:06.792,"MAN: Oh, yeah?"
00:24:06.834,00:24:08.709,Sorry. Hi.
00:24:08.750,00:24:09.959,Hi. What can I do for you today?
00:24:10.000,00:24:11.583,MAN: Which dude?
00:24:11.625,00:24:13.750,Dude that looks like a lizard?
00:24:13.792,00:24:15.750,"I, um..."
00:24:15.792,00:24:19.291,"I-I'm sorry, I-I would like-- MAN: Grosses me out."
00:24:19.333,00:24:26.542,"a cashier's check in the full amount, made out to Oncology Partners of New Mexico, please."
00:24:26.583,00:24:31.458,"Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y."
00:24:35.333,00:24:39.709,MAN: I don't understand why they're forcing you to choose between piccolo and oboe.
00:24:39.750,00:24:41.792,You show so much promise with both.
00:24:41.834,00:24:44.125,They can't have any switching between woodwinds.
00:24:44.166,00:24:47.250,"No matter how they divide it up, someone would be left out."
00:24:48.834,00:24:50.750,"MAN: Sure, rules are rules."
00:24:50.792,00:24:54.208,"But I'm telling you, you really shine on that oboe."
00:24:54.250,00:24:56.709,"You have real talent, and I'm not just saying that."
00:24:56.750,00:24:58.792,Thanks.
00:24:58.834,00:25:00.625,What about Mr. Pemberton?
00:25:00.667,00:25:02.750,Is he giving you enough individual attention?
00:25:02.792,00:25:06.959,I'd say so. He tries to talk to each one of us at least once during every practice.
00:25:07.000,00:25:09.709,That's good.
00:25:09.750,00:25:11.834,"It's key, I think."
00:25:11.875,00:25:14.792,"Hey, so how was soccer practice?"
00:25:17.834,00:25:20.333,I think that was in our backyard.
00:25:36.875,00:25:40.083,What the hell are you doing out here?
00:25:42.667,00:25:43.917,"Hey, Dad."
00:25:45.375,00:25:46.792,"Hey, Mom."
00:25:46.834,00:25:48.834,Jake.
00:25:48.875,00:25:52.250,Got new patio furniture.
00:25:52.291,00:25:54.959,Right on.
00:25:56.417,00:25:58.959,Hey. Heh-heh. My leg.
00:27:02.417,00:27:04.875,WOMAN: What do you think it could be?
00:27:06.083,00:27:08.500,God knows I'm no expert.
00:27:08.542,00:27:12.667,"I don't know. Uppers, downers?"
00:27:12.709,00:27:16.917,I think we should check his arms for needle marks.
00:27:19.458,00:27:21.792,Do we let him stay?
00:27:21.834,00:27:24.834,The Presbyterian Church has those meetings.
00:27:24.875,00:27:29.917,"So maybe on condition, you know?"
00:27:29.959,00:27:32.792,I-I just don't know what to tell Jake.
00:27:40.083,00:27:41.333,Hey.
00:27:41.375,00:27:44.458,Hey. Good evening.
00:27:44.500,00:27:47.041,Well?
00:27:47.083,00:27:48.792,"What time's, uh--?"
00:27:48.834,00:27:51.166,What time is dinner?
00:27:51.208,00:27:52.917,In about an hour.
00:27:56.709,00:28:00.166,"You know, I could, uh, wash those clothes if you like."
00:28:00.208,00:28:02.041,They look a little lived in.
00:28:02.083,00:28:06.834,"Oh, um, no, that's cool."
00:28:11.291,00:28:12.959,We are not doing this again.
00:28:14.959,00:28:18.250,"We said we'd lay down the law, we lay down the law."
00:28:18.291,00:28:21.625,We just have to be consistent about it.
00:29:06.625,00:29:09.667,Hey.
00:29:09.709,00:29:13.834,"WALT: You're, uh-- You're not taking the bus?"
00:29:14.917,00:29:16.959,Oh.
00:29:17.000,00:29:18.208,"All right. Well, listen."
00:29:18.250,00:29:22.917,"Um, give me maybe another 20 minutes, and we'll get out of here."
00:29:22.959,00:29:24.834,All right.
00:29:24.875,00:29:27.000,All right.
00:29:27.041,00:29:28.709,"Yeah, good."
00:29:59.500,00:30:03.333,"You know, I-I just think that, uh..."
00:30:05.750,00:30:09.917,things have a way of working themselves out.
00:30:32.250,00:30:34.375,JESSE: Wow.
00:30:34.417,00:30:36.792,"When did you, uh--?"
00:30:36.834,00:30:39.041,Last May at the year-end assembly.
00:30:39.083,00:30:42.125,They gave me that one too.
00:30:43.417,00:30:47.083,Environmental Consciousness Award.
00:30:47.125,00:30:51.125,"What's that mean? What, you, like, recycle cans and shit?"
00:30:51.166,00:30:56.041,I contacted The Albuquerque Journal and asked what kind of chemicals they use to bleach their paper.
00:30:56.083,00:30:57.792,Wound up writing an article about it.
00:30:57.834,00:30:59.417,"Right on, little bro."
00:30:59.458,00:31:02.667,Making mad inroads with the business community.
00:31:02.709,00:31:04.291,All right.
00:31:04.333,00:31:10.166,"Now, hey, remember, not all learning comes out of books."
00:31:15.750,00:31:18.709,"You know, we should-- We should hang out more often."
00:31:18.750,00:31:23.208,"You know, just, uh-- Just kick back and chill."
00:31:23.250,00:31:28.417,"I mean, if you ever, like, I don't know, need advice."
00:31:28.458,00:31:32.917,"Because, you know, I've been-- I've been through it all."
00:31:35.750,00:31:39.709,"Yeah, man, you, uh--?"
00:31:39.750,00:31:42.083,"It's a piccolo, actually."
00:31:42.125,00:31:44.375,"Dude, play some, uh-- Play some Jethro Tull."
00:31:50.875,00:31:53.000,"We're, uh-- We're good."
00:31:54.458,00:31:55.834,Jake?
00:31:55.875,00:31:57.709,"Yeah. Fine, Mom."
00:31:57.750,00:32:02.125,"Well, that's good."
00:32:09.709,00:32:14.000,"You know, what the hell?"
00:32:14.041,00:32:16.041,"What am I, some criminal or something?"
00:32:16.834,00:32:18.125,Whatever.
00:32:18.166,00:32:19.709,Whatever?
00:32:19.750,00:32:22.083,"What, you--?"
00:32:22.125,00:32:27.834,"Like, Oh, we can't let that scumbag warp the mind of our favorite son."
00:32:27.875,00:32:29.667,I'm the favorite?
00:32:30.750,00:32:32.458,"Yeah, right."
00:32:32.500,00:32:34.917,You're practically all they ever talk about.
00:34:12.083,00:34:15.375,"Oh, snap."
00:34:16.375,00:34:18.583,Awesome.
00:34:51.041,00:34:52.250,Yeah?
00:34:52.291,00:34:53.792,"MAN: Yo, man, it's me."
00:34:53.834,00:34:57.792,"Hey, listen. You know that, uh--? That product?"
00:34:57.834,00:34:59.667,You got any more of that?
00:34:59.709,00:35:02.250,"No, man, okay?"
00:35:02.291,00:35:04.417,"You want charity, go ask the Salvation Army."
00:35:04.458,00:35:06.458,"No, no charity. No."
00:35:06.500,00:35:08.834,"I got this cousin, he's got him some rich friends."
00:35:08.875,00:35:11.750,"These dudes are in town, they're looking to party."
00:35:11.792,00:35:15.709,"And your stuff is, like, so sweet."
00:35:15.750,00:35:17.959,So what do you say?
00:35:18.000,00:35:19.917,You up for making some fat stacks?
00:35:19.959,00:35:22.917,'Cause they'll buy everything you got.
00:35:32.500,00:35:36.125,Yes. Yes. Okay.
00:35:41.875,00:35:44.166,"Oh, you can't be serious."
00:35:45.542,00:35:47.291,What the hell are you doing here?
00:35:47.333,00:35:49.458,"Yo, I waited till the ball buster left."
00:35:49.500,00:35:52.166,"I mean, no offense."
00:35:53.875,00:35:55.709,"Who sent you, huh? Huh?"
00:35:55.750,00:35:57.458,You wearing a wire?
00:35:57.500,00:35:58.834,You setting me up?
00:35:58.875,00:36:01.542,Homo. A wire? You want a wire?
00:36:01.583,00:36:04.208,I got a wire.
00:36:04.250,00:36:05.917,What the hell's wrong with you?
00:36:05.959,00:36:07.959,A wire.
00:36:08.000,00:36:09.625,Jesus.
00:36:10.834,00:36:13.333,So who did you tell about...?
00:36:13.375,00:36:14.750,"Nobody. What, are you nuts?"
00:36:14.792,00:36:16.917,Then why are you here?
00:36:18.625,00:36:20.458,I don't know.
00:36:20.500,00:36:23.834,"To, like, touch base."
00:36:23.875,00:36:25.792,Touch base?
00:36:26.750,00:36:32.750,"Yeah, you know, um, what they call a debrief."
00:36:32.792,00:36:36.625,"Maybe we could, like-- Thought we could debrief."
00:36:36.667,00:36:38.834,Debrief?
00:36:38.875,00:36:44.000,"Wow, that's-- That's what you think we need, debrief?"
00:36:45.542,00:36:50.125,"Yeah, a-after what happened, it just seems like the thing to do."
00:36:50.166,00:36:52.333,"Kind of, you know, talk about it."
00:36:52.375,00:36:55.542,"I mean, we can't-- We can't talk to anybody else."
00:36:56.750,00:37:05.125,"Anyway, th-that and I wanted to, uh,-- Wanted to, you know, tell you how much everybody digs that meth we cooked."
00:37:05.166,00:37:10.208,Everybody digs the meth we cooked.
00:37:10.250,00:37:15.834,Seriously. I got dudes that would give their left nut for a little more.
00:37:15.875,00:37:17.583,Oh. Great.
00:37:17.625,00:37:29.917,"I'm just saying, I mean, if you ever, you know, saw your way clear to, um, you know, you and I cooking a little more..."
00:37:33.875,00:37:35.041,Wow.
00:37:37.000,00:37:39.667,Get the hell off my property.
00:37:39.709,00:37:42.667,What? I'm just saying.
00:37:46.250,00:37:50.583,All right.
00:37:50.625,00:37:53.375,Four grand.
00:37:53.417,00:37:57.291,Your share from selling that batch.
00:37:57.333,00:38:00.333,That's why I'm here.
00:38:00.375,00:38:05.417,"Yeah, yeah, that's right."
00:38:28.917,00:38:31.250,Non-small-cell adenocarcinoma.
00:38:31.291,00:38:36.000,"Stage 3A, which means it's spread from the lung to the lymph nodes."
00:38:39.291,00:38:42.000,But it-- Is it--?
00:38:42.041,00:38:44.709,It is...
00:38:44.750,00:38:46.041,curable?
00:38:46.083,00:38:49.709,I prefer the word treatable.
00:38:49.750,00:38:52.792,But the treatments we have at our disposal can be very effective.
00:38:52.834,00:39:00.750,"Without making any promises, I can tell you that the specific course of radiation and chemotherapy I'm going to suggest has been successful."
00:39:00.792,00:39:06.250,"In certain cases, it's prolonged a patient's life and even resulted in remission."
00:39:06.291,00:39:09.542,"Hmm. Um, w-what about the side effects?"
00:39:09.583,00:39:13.208,"Well, they can be mild to practically non-existent."
00:39:13.250,00:39:15.750,Or they can be pretty darn awful.
00:39:15.792,00:39:17.333,It varies from patient to patient.
00:39:17.375,00:39:23.166,"Typically, there's hair loss, which begins a couple of weeks after the start of chemotherapy."
00:39:23.208,00:39:26.709,"You may find yourself unusually fatigued, not much energy."
00:39:26.750,00:39:28.709,You won't want to get out of bed.
00:39:28.750,00:39:32.875,You may lose weight due to reduced appetite and certain intestinal issues.
00:39:32.917,00:39:36.959,"Muscle aches and pains, gums will get sore and bleed."
00:39:37.000,00:39:44.250,"And, uh, of course, there's the possibility of nausea, although we'll prescribe an antiemetic and try to counteract that."
00:39:44.291,00:39:46.500,Possible kidney or bladder irritation.
00:39:46.542,00:39:48.750,You may wind up with increased bruising and bleeding.
00:39:48.792,00:39:53.917,There are maybe sexual symptoms.
00:40:22.875,00:40:25.917,Got anything to say?
00:40:31.875,00:40:33.458,What do you know about that?
00:40:34.875,00:40:36.083,Nothing.
00:40:36.125,00:40:37.750,"Well, that's not gonna fly this time."
00:40:37.792,00:40:40.625,How many chances have we given you?
00:40:40.667,00:40:45.625,How many times have we sat right here and had the same conversation over and over again?
00:40:45.667,00:40:47.959,Where you look us in the eye and you plead ignorance?
00:40:48.000,00:40:55.542,"And you play on our emotions and you tell us anything and everything you think we wanna hear, just so we'll give you another chance."
00:40:55.583,00:40:58.834,Mm-hm.
00:40:58.875,00:41:00.625,Every time.
00:41:04.750,00:41:07.041,"Enough, Jesse."
00:41:07.083,00:41:08.333,Enough.
00:41:09.792,00:41:12.542,MAN: We are not going to have this in our house.
00:41:13.875,00:41:16.542,We need you to leave.
00:41:55.709,00:41:57.917,Thanks for not telling on me.
00:42:02.333,00:42:05.834,"Uh, you think I could have it back?"
00:42:20.166,00:42:22.000,It's skunk-weed anyway.
00:42:40.166,00:42:48.500,"The Air Force is aware of the widely-held belief that some of these could be flying saucers from-- You know, this is actually very hopeful."
00:42:54.875,00:42:56.750,Did you hear me?
00:42:56.792,00:43:00.625,"I said this is really very, very hopeful."
00:43:00.667,00:43:02.291,Oh.
00:43:02.333,00:43:06.291,Defense Command in Colorado Springs issued an order-- So can I call them and--?
00:43:09.834,00:43:11.458,Uh...
00:43:11.500,00:43:23.875,"Even as they did so, the military wondered whether their scientific know-how and their best weapons would be effective in any battle of the Earth versus the flying saucers."
00:43:23.917,00:43:29.166,"I just think that we need to discuss it a little more, that's all."
00:43:29.208,00:43:31.709,What is there to discuss?
00:43:31.750,00:43:35.375,"You're gonna get the best treatment, and he's the best."
00:43:35.417,00:43:41.125,"Well, there's the money discussion. I think-- No, $90,000 out of pocket."
00:43:41.166,00:43:43.333,Maybe more.
00:43:43.375,00:43:47.291,"There's financing, there's, um, installment plans."
00:43:47.333,00:43:49.542,I-I-I could always go back to work.
00:43:49.583,00:43:51.583,"Walt, there's always a way."
00:43:51.625,00:43:52.834,All right.
00:43:52.875,00:43:55.959,"Skyler, say that there is a way."
00:43:56.000,00:43:59.166,"And we spend all that money, and..."
00:44:10.792,00:44:15.625,Am I supposed to leave you with all that debt?
00:44:15.667,00:44:16.834,No.
00:44:16.875,00:44:18.667,Honey.
00:44:18.709,00:44:22.041,I just don't want emotions ruling us.
00:44:22.083,00:44:26.750,Maybe treatment isn't the way to go.
00:44:26.792,00:44:30.458,"WALT JR.: Then why don't you just fucking die, already?"
00:44:33.333,00:44:35.917,Just give up and die.
00:45:25.250,00:45:29.000,"Come on, move your ass."
00:45:29.041,00:45:31.417,"MAN: Uh, name of the guy?"
00:45:32.875,00:45:34.041,"Yeah, dude, I'm not worried."
00:45:34.083,00:45:36.500,I got the best fricking attorney.
00:45:36.542,00:45:39.125,I would not want to be on the other side of this one.
00:45:39.166,00:45:45.959,"He's got this little team of ninjas too, that go out and do forward operations-- He's got crap on people."
00:46:58.125,00:47:00.208,MAN: What the hell?
00:47:03.792,00:47:04.959,What?
00:47:05.000,00:47:06.500,"ATTENDANT: Don't go near it, buddy."
00:47:06.542,00:47:08.750,MAN: What--? What are you doing?
00:47:08.792,00:47:10.041,Call the fire people.
00:47:10.083,00:47:11.917,ATTENDANT: Yeah. I have a fire...
00:47:11.959,00:47:13.250,MAN: I don't believe this.
00:47:13.291,00:47:14.792,Do you know how much I paid for that?
00:47:19.834,00:47:22.125,Why are you doing this?
00:00:03.834,00:00:07.542,"Here is, uh-- Here's my résumé."
00:00:07.542,00:00:16.834,"Um, I mean, technically it says, uh, curriculum vitae, which I think is more professional, but, uh, you know, same thing, pretty much."
00:00:16.834,00:00:18.792,"MAN: That's, uh-- Wow, great."
00:00:18.792,00:00:22.750,This position truly is a no-experience-necessary kind of thing.
00:00:22.750,00:00:29.375,"And, uh, it doesn't really say it here, but, um, I have a solid background in, uh-- In sales."
00:00:29.375,00:00:31.625,"I'm pretty much a self-starter, so..."
00:00:31.625,00:00:33.917,"That's excellent, but, um-- Excellent."
00:00:33.917,00:00:35.291,I just...
00:00:35.291,00:00:42.208,"I really feel I could be a major, major asset to your sales force."
00:00:42.208,00:00:43.917,Ah.
00:00:43.917,00:00:46.542,I'm thinking there's a little misunderstanding.
00:00:46.542,00:00:48.291,This isn't actually a sales job.
00:00:48.291,00:00:58.834,"I mean, I'd be happy to consider you for a sales position, but all our agents need to be licensed, have at least two years on-the-job experience and usually a college degree."
00:01:03.375,00:01:05.875,What you'll be doing is more like...
00:01:05.875,00:01:07.750,advertising.
00:01:20.750,00:01:22.333,"Hey, Jesse."
00:01:22.333,00:01:24.750,"Hey, man."
00:01:24.750,00:01:25.750,"Yo, man."
00:01:25.750,00:01:27.917,What up?
00:01:27.917,00:01:31.291,Where you been keeping yourself?
00:01:31.291,00:01:33.417,Nice duds.
00:01:33.417,00:01:35.291,"Yeah, you too."
00:01:35.291,00:01:37.083,Thanks.
00:01:37.083,00:01:40.208,"JESSE: Yo, why would you wanna do this lame-ass job, anyway?"
00:01:40.208,00:01:42.166,"I mean, no-- No offense."
00:01:42.166,00:01:43.792,"'Cause I'm on probation, yo."
00:01:43.792,00:01:47.417,I gotta prove to the man I'm rehabilitated.
00:01:47.417,00:01:50.792,"Upstanding citizen, all that shit."
00:01:50.792,00:01:53.667,It's really good exercise too.
00:01:53.667,00:01:55.917,"You can't just stand there, you have to spin the arrow."
00:01:55.917,00:01:59.834,"There's all these moves you have to learn, like the helicopter."
00:02:03.166,00:02:06.417,Wow.
00:02:06.417,00:02:07.792,That one's a bitch.
00:02:07.792,00:02:09.834,I'm not very good at it yet.
00:02:09.834,00:02:12.125,"You, uh, really opened my eyes to the possibilities."
00:02:12.125,00:02:15.709,Yeah.
00:02:12.125,00:02:18.000,"Hey, anyways, um, thanks for the toke."
00:02:18.000,00:02:24.542,"Speaking of which, you think you could maybe, uh, hook me up with some crystal?"
00:02:24.542,00:02:27.500,"Uh, no, I've-- I've been out of the business for a while."
00:02:27.500,00:02:29.834,"Actually, now thinking about retiring."
00:02:29.834,00:02:32.041,What? No.
00:02:32.041,00:02:34.834,That stuff you made is unbelievable.
00:02:34.834,00:02:36.375,It was pretty awesome.
00:02:36.375,00:02:38.750,Retirement? Argh!
00:02:40.166,00:02:44.500,"No, man, I-I had this, uh-- This partner who was helping me cook."
00:02:44.500,00:02:46.375,"I mean, I was doing most of the work..."
00:02:48.709,00:02:51.291,"...but he was an asshole, so."
00:02:51.291,00:02:57.792,"Anyway, I mean, pseudo's getting harder and harder to come by and-- Yo, I can hook you up with some pseudo."
00:02:57.792,00:02:59.667,Major pseudo.
00:02:59.667,00:03:02.250,"I got channels, bro."
00:03:02.250,00:03:03.875,We could partner up.
00:03:05.667,00:03:07.083,No pressure.
00:03:07.083,00:03:09.834,No pressure.
00:03:09.834,00:03:12.625,"Oh, shit. I gotta go."
00:03:21.917,00:03:24.542,"Yo, this way to savings."
00:03:24.542,00:03:26.834,"Save your dollar bills, y'all."
00:03:35.875,00:03:40.667,Come on! Save some money.
00:04:05.667,00:04:07.250,WALT: It's a stupid gift.
00:04:07.250,00:04:08.959,"SKYLER: No, it isn't. He'll love it."
00:04:08.959,00:04:10.834,I don't know what I was thinking.
00:04:10.834,00:04:13.959,Didn't the invitation even say no gifts?
00:04:13.959,00:04:15.834,Walt.
00:04:15.834,00:04:17.875,We have to go.
00:04:17.875,00:04:19.834,"I know, I'm not complaining."
00:04:19.834,00:04:21.291,"Yes, you are."
00:04:23.625,00:04:25.792,"Look, we need this."
00:04:25.792,00:04:28.041,We've been through a lot lately. Okay?
00:04:28.041,00:04:29.834,Mm-hm.
00:04:31.709,00:04:35.709,"SKYLER: Jesus, guess we didn't get the beige memo."
00:04:35.709,00:04:37.834,"Ah, we're okay."
00:04:37.834,00:04:41.291,"Yes, I-- I look like I'm wearing a prom dress from 1985."
00:04:41.291,00:04:43.083,"Honey, you look fine."
00:04:43.083,00:04:47.750,"Walt, this is the only thing I could find that fit me."
00:04:47.750,00:04:52.750,"God, would you look at that."
00:04:52.750,00:04:54.333,So? Come on.
00:04:54.333,00:04:57.792,"Sir, I'll take that for you."
00:04:58.959,00:05:02.166,Thank you.
00:05:04.291,00:05:05.792,"Oh, look, there's Elliott."
00:05:05.792,00:05:08.709,"Oh, come on, let's go say hello."
00:05:09.875,00:05:11.750,Elliott. Ha!
00:05:13.792,00:05:16.041,You made it.
00:05:16.041,00:05:17.750,Happy birthday.
00:05:17.750,00:05:19.750,Wouldn't miss it for the world.
00:05:19.750,00:05:22.750,"Hi. Oh. Oh, that's right."
00:05:22.750,00:05:25.375,Great to see you.
00:05:25.375,00:05:28.750,"Well, these days a little more big than beautiful, but..."
00:05:28.750,00:05:32.417,"Of course, congratulations."
00:05:32.417,00:05:37.125,Thank you.
00:05:37.125,00:05:39.834,Oh. Oh.
00:05:39.834,00:05:41.458,It's been ages.
00:05:41.458,00:05:45.125,"Oh, it's so good to see you."
00:05:45.125,00:05:47.166,Ha-ha-ha!
00:05:47.166,00:05:48.875,"Skyler, welcome."
00:05:48.875,00:05:51.583,Thank you.
00:05:51.583,00:05:55.333,When are you due?
00:05:55.333,00:05:58.583,"And actually, we recently found out that it's a girl."
00:05:58.583,00:06:01.417,"Oh, that's so wonderful."
00:06:01.417,00:06:04.125,"Yeah, we've been thinking about it for ourselves."
00:06:04.125,00:06:05.709,"Yeah, thinking about it."
00:06:07.917,00:06:13.834,"Uh... Oh, hey, by the way, uh, securing that patent was just amazing."
00:06:13.834,00:06:17.834,"I mean, the work that your company is doing..."
00:06:17.834,00:06:19.792,Congratulations to both of you.
00:06:19.792,00:06:21.750,Hard work and a lot of luck.
00:06:21.750,00:06:23.834,"Yeah. Oh, well, now."
00:06:23.834,00:06:25.333,MAN: Elliott.
00:06:25.333,00:06:26.917,Will you excuse us?
00:06:26.917,00:06:29.041,"Make yourselves at home, we'll catch up later."
00:06:29.041,00:06:30.542,"Sure, sure. Okay."
00:06:30.542,00:06:32.041,Okay.
00:06:32.041,00:06:33.875,Thank you.
00:06:33.875,00:06:35.834,"John, Missy. How are you?"
00:06:35.834,00:06:37.500,Shall we?
00:06:38.792,00:06:41.291,MAN: Congratulations.
00:06:49.458,00:06:50.834,Oh.
00:06:50.834,00:06:52.917,Whoa.
00:07:12.250,00:07:13.625,Hm.
00:07:55.750,00:07:56.959,Walt?
00:07:56.959,00:07:58.792,I thought that was you.
00:07:58.792,00:08:00.208,Farley.
00:08:00.208,00:08:01.959,Long time no see.
00:08:01.959,00:08:04.333,This is Walter White.
00:08:04.333,00:08:08.875,"Back at Caltech, he was-- You were just a master of crystallography."
00:08:08.875,00:08:15.166,I remember this one time we were stuck on this protein problem for-- For weeks.
00:08:15.166,00:08:19.709,"You just breezed right in, and-- And you had one word for us..."
00:08:19.709,00:08:22.792,Synchrotrons.
00:08:22.792,00:08:26.583,They generate pure and more complete patterns than x-ray beams.
00:08:26.583,00:08:29.792,Data collection takes a fraction of the time.
00:08:29.792,00:08:32.417,This is the White in Gray Matter.
00:08:33.583,00:08:36.792,"Tell 'em, Walt."
00:08:36.792,00:08:41.750,"Uh, well, back when Elliott and I were in grad school, we came up with the name."
00:08:41.750,00:08:45.083,Ahem.
00:08:45.083,00:08:47.792,So together they became Gray Matter Technologies.
00:08:47.792,00:08:48.959,"Cute, huh?"
00:08:48.959,00:08:50.834,So you run the company with Elliott?
00:08:50.834,00:08:53.834,"FARLEY: No. No, that's-- That's Gretchen and Elliott."
00:08:53.834,00:08:57.417,"Yeah, yeah. You know, I-- I gravitated toward education."
00:08:57.417,00:08:59.917,Ah. What university?
00:09:01.875,00:09:05.875,"Oh, wow, it's a Stratocaster."
00:09:05.875,00:09:09.792,Not-- Not just any Strat.
00:09:09.792,00:09:12.000,ELLIOTT: No way.
00:09:12.000,00:09:16.792,"To Elliott, sorry about the buckle rash, Eric Clapton."
00:09:16.792,00:09:19.709,Thank you.
00:09:19.709,00:09:21.834,Why is he doing this?
00:09:21.834,00:09:23.792,"What is he, like, 8 years old?"
00:09:23.792,00:09:25.709,"Here, honey."
00:09:28.834,00:09:30.250,Thanks.
00:09:30.250,00:09:31.542,"Oh, this is from Walt."
00:09:31.542,00:09:33.500,"Oh, God."
00:09:34.959,00:09:37.000,Hey.
00:09:37.000,00:09:39.417,Let's see what we got.
00:09:45.166,00:09:47.041,Yum Good Ramen.
00:10:08.834,00:10:11.834,Sold them down at Ralstow's in the hardware isle.
00:10:11.834,00:10:13.917,Right next to the-- The-- What was it?
00:10:13.917,00:10:16.250,Sterno. Yeah.
00:10:16.250,00:10:18.625,"Yeah, ten for a dollar ninety-nine."
00:10:18.625,00:10:24.041,"To this day, I am convinced these noodles were responsible for our success."
00:10:24.041,00:10:26.291,This was our lifeblood.
00:10:26.291,00:10:27.792,"Man, where'd you find these?"
00:10:27.792,00:10:30.125,I thought they'd been outlawed years ago.
00:10:32.041,00:10:33.917,I love it.
00:10:35.834,00:10:37.583,"Thank you, Walt."
00:10:37.583,00:10:39.750,Well.
00:10:39.750,00:10:41.917,For the man who has everything.
00:10:42.917,00:10:44.208,ELLIOTT: No.
00:10:44.208,00:10:46.166,"No, you remember the fat guy."
00:10:46.166,00:10:48.041,We used to call him Snot Trough.
00:10:48.041,00:10:49.792,He had that thing under his nose.
00:10:49.792,00:10:52.709,What do you call that thing?
00:10:52.709,00:10:55.792,That was the same guy who always smelled like chocolate milk.
00:10:55.792,00:10:57.750,It was.
00:10:57.750,00:11:00.250,"It-- It wasn't Dobkins, it was..."
00:11:00.250,00:11:10.000,"Anyway, I swear to Christ, he used to iron those patches onto the elbows of his-- His members-only jacket because he thought it made him look more distinguished."
00:11:10.000,00:11:11.583,Didn't it? I thought it-- No.
00:11:13.458,00:11:15.792,"Oh, God."
00:11:15.792,00:11:17.792,To Snot Trough.
00:11:17.792,00:11:19.709,God bless him.
00:11:19.709,00:11:20.917,Hmmm.
00:11:20.917,00:11:26.375,Do you remember the--? The professor who used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?
00:11:31.834,00:11:35.000,"Oh, he didn't invent it."
00:11:35.000,00:11:37.917,"He just improved it, you know."
00:11:37.917,00:11:39.875,Oh. It was easy to kill 15 minutes.
00:11:39.875,00:11:40.875,Yeah.
00:11:42.375,00:11:44.166,"Oh, God."
00:11:44.166,00:11:46.417,"I miss this, Walt."
00:11:46.417,00:11:49.125,Yeah. Me too.
00:11:49.125,00:11:51.458,"Listen, uh, we-- We ought to get together more often."
00:11:55.750,00:11:58.792,"Oh, sure, yeah, absolutely."
00:11:58.792,00:12:03.959,"But, you know, what I mean is that-- That you and I should work together again."
00:12:06.166,00:12:08.959,Are you gonna teach high school?
00:12:08.959,00:12:11.500,W-what's stopping us?
00:12:14.041,00:12:16.834,"Wait a minute, Elliott, what are you--?"
00:12:16.834,00:12:19.750,Are you asking me to come work for you at Gray Matter?
00:12:19.750,00:12:21.792,"Yeah, why not? You-- You'd fit right in."
00:12:21.792,00:12:25.333,"You're brilliant, you-- You got a ton of experience."
00:12:25.333,00:12:27.041,"Well, I..."
00:12:27.041,00:12:29.250,I wouldn't really know where to begin.
00:12:29.250,00:12:30.875,I mean...
00:12:30.875,00:12:32.959,"God, you have no idea."
00:12:32.959,00:12:40.166,I spend my days just drawing out atoms on the chalkboard and trying to get these kids to learn the periodic table.
00:12:40.166,00:12:42.083,"Look, I-- I-- I understand."
00:12:42.083,00:12:45.917,"Y-you're a little rusty, but you're not seeing the upside here."
00:12:49.792,00:12:54.917,"You know when you've been trying to crack some problem for months on end, you get tunnel vision."
00:12:54.917,00:13:00.208,"One guy thinking outside of the box, you may be exactly what we need."
00:13:15.375,00:13:23.667,"Well, listen, Elliott, it-- The offer is very appealing, it really is, I thank you."
00:13:23.667,00:13:25.750,"But, uh, there's..."
00:13:25.750,00:13:28.375,There's something you should know.
00:13:30.458,00:13:35.375,I-- I-- I have some personal issues.
00:13:37.875,00:13:40.375,"Well, yeah..."
00:13:40.375,00:13:43.792,but it's-- It's complicated.
00:13:43.792,00:13:45.542,We can help you.
00:13:45.542,00:13:48.542,We-- We have excellent health insurance.
00:13:50.709,00:13:52.792,The best.
00:14:13.750,00:14:16.125,"Um, hey, did you--? Did you try those prosciutto-wrapped figs?"
00:14:16.125,00:14:18.333,"They were, like, wow."
00:14:16.125,00:14:20.792,They were just-- I must have had about 30 of those suckers.
00:14:20.792,00:14:23.083,"Oh, and the seafood table, did you see that?"
00:14:23.083,00:14:26.834,"They had lobster tail, they had crab legs, like, shrimp."
00:14:26.834,00:14:28.834,They had...
00:14:31.041,00:14:32.542,Walt.
00:14:31.041,00:14:34.709,What the hell did you say to Elliott?
00:14:34.709,00:14:36.834,What?
00:14:34.709,00:14:39.834,"You told him about the cancer, didn't you? Didn't you?"
00:14:39.834,00:14:42.041,I can't believe it.
00:14:42.041,00:14:51.041,"Okay, we were talking, he asked how you were doing, and I am sorry, but I don't have the best poker face these days where that's concerned."
00:14:54.875,00:14:56.583,He pressed you? Come on.
00:14:56.583,00:15:02.000,"Walt, when it came right down to it, I didn't know what else to do but tell him the truth."
00:15:02.000,00:15:05.917,"The truth? Well, how about you just said, He's fine, huh?"
00:15:08.041,00:15:11.125,You could have said that. He's fine. It would have been done.
00:15:11.125,00:15:12.834,I don't like the way you're talking.
00:15:12.834,00:15:20.125,I don't like the way you talk about my private affairs to people who are not even in our lives anymore.
00:15:20.125,00:15:22.792,"Well, what exactly did he say to you?"
00:15:22.792,00:15:24.458,He offered me a job.
00:15:24.458,00:15:28.083,"Yes. Kind of like some fig leaf, you know."
00:15:28.083,00:15:33.959,Some face-saving bullshit that allowed me to generously accept his charity.
00:15:33.959,00:15:39.041,"And then when I turned that down, he flat out offered to pay for my treatment."
00:15:39.041,00:15:42.291,"Which is exactly what you expected him to do, didn't you?"
00:15:42.291,00:15:43.917,Walt.
00:15:43.917,00:15:46.917,No. I did not put him up-- Please. Come on. Come on.
00:15:49.834,00:15:52.542,"Okay, what did you say?"
00:15:54.417,00:15:56.291,Walt?
00:15:56.291,00:15:59.250,What do you think I said?
00:15:59.250,00:16:02.959,Why? Walt.
00:16:50.792,00:16:54.417,Ready to go?
00:16:55.834,00:16:57.959,Okay.
00:16:59.542,00:17:01.917,"Bye, honey."
00:17:39.750,00:17:42.834,"Hey, dude."
00:17:42.834,00:17:44.458,Uh...
00:17:44.458,00:17:50.500,"No, man. Those are for, like, um, you know, uh, ventilation."
00:17:50.500,00:17:51.875,Cool.
00:17:51.875,00:17:53.291,Woo.
00:17:53.291,00:17:56.542,"Nice setup, huh?"
00:17:56.542,00:17:58.750,Man.
00:17:58.750,00:18:08.417,"I used to have, like, twice as much glassware until my, um, dumb-ass ex-partner drove us into a ditch and wrecked most of it."
00:18:08.417,00:18:11.000,"Big-ass beaker, huh?"
00:18:11.000,00:18:14.792,"Hey, wait, wait, no, that's-- Yeah, that's a boiling flask."
00:18:14.792,00:18:16.834,This is a beaker.
00:18:16.834,00:18:21.875,Here's a Griffin beaker.
00:18:21.875,00:18:24.750,"Here's, uh, an Erlenmeyer flask."
00:18:24.750,00:18:27.250,"Um, you got-- Wow."
00:18:27.250,00:18:28.959,You really know your shit.
00:18:28.959,00:18:31.625,"It's just basic chemistry, yo."
00:18:32.875,00:18:35.000,So...
00:18:35.000,00:18:37.250,you got something for me?
00:18:37.250,00:18:39.000,"Aw, hells, yeah."
00:18:49.458,00:18:51.291,Okay.
00:18:51.291,00:18:53.709,We're in business.
00:18:53.709,00:18:54.834,"Right on, Badger."
00:18:54.834,00:18:57.875,"Dude, check this out."
00:18:57.875,00:18:59.208,Jesus.
00:19:02.917,00:19:06.125,We might see javelinas.
00:19:35.125,00:19:36.834,Are you gonna help me or what?
00:19:42.500,00:19:43.542,Hey.
00:19:48.875,00:19:50.166,Badger!
00:20:00.875,00:20:03.041,"Yeah, buddy. Huh? Yeah."
00:20:47.709,00:20:50.583,WALT JR.: Let's see the money.
00:20:50.583,00:20:51.959,Here.
00:20:51.959,00:20:54.333,I need five each.
00:20:54.333,00:20:56.333,Here.
00:20:56.333,00:20:59.083,What about him?
00:20:59.083,00:21:01.750,Are you kidding?
00:21:01.750,00:21:03.750,Whatever.
00:21:03.750,00:21:05.750,What about that guy?
00:21:05.750,00:21:07.500,"No, he looks like a businessman."
00:21:07.500,00:21:08.792,BOY: So what?
00:21:08.792,00:21:11.709,So businessmen are always in a hurry.
00:21:11.709,00:21:15.041,"They're always, like, going to some meeting or something."
00:21:15.041,00:21:17.333,"Seriously, he's just gonna say no."
00:21:18.959,00:21:21.208,"BOY: Hey, hey, this guy."
00:21:21.208,00:21:22.458,This is our guy.
00:21:22.458,00:21:23.709,You're up.
00:21:23.709,00:21:25.625,Wh-why do I have to do it?
00:21:29.583,00:21:31.041,Shit.
00:21:33.625,00:21:42.041,"Um, excuse me, hey, um, we forgot our IDs, and we were wondering if you could do us a favor and buy us a six-pack?"
00:21:42.041,00:21:44.834,"You know, what you're asking is illegal."
00:21:44.834,00:21:46.083,Um...
00:21:46.083,00:21:47.709,"No, it's not."
00:21:47.709,00:21:49.834,"Yeah, it is."
00:21:49.834,00:21:52.500,"Oh, shit."
00:21:54.542,00:21:57.667,MAN: Guess you win the jackpot.
00:21:57.667,00:22:00.709,This is not how I wanted to spend my night off.
00:22:00.709,00:22:03.333,Consider this your first and last warning.
00:22:03.333,00:22:04.709,"Yes, sir."
00:22:04.709,00:22:06.083,"You're lucky you got a good dad, here."
00:22:15.083,00:22:17.333,The other guys had to run.
00:22:17.333,00:22:20.375,I-- I couldn't talk my way out of it.
00:22:20.375,00:22:22.750,"Not cool, man. Not cool."
00:22:22.750,00:22:26.333,"What, you never tried to buy beer when you were my age?"
00:22:26.333,00:22:29.667,I'm talking about you calling me and not your father.
00:22:29.667,00:22:31.875,How do you think that'd make him feel?
00:22:41.667,00:22:45.417,SKYLER: I don't even know what to say to you.
00:22:46.875,00:22:49.125,Just go.
00:22:49.125,00:22:51.417,I'll deal with you later.
00:22:57.875,00:22:59.542,Where's Walt?
00:22:59.542,00:23:02.250,I haven't seen him since this morning.
00:23:02.250,00:23:04.709,Your guess is as good as mine.
00:23:04.709,00:23:07.291,"Listen, do me a favor, all right?"
00:23:07.291,00:23:09.375,Don't tell him about the kid.
00:23:09.375,00:23:13.166,He's just a teenager trying to score some beer.
00:23:13.166,00:23:16.834,"You know, growing pains."
00:23:21.458,00:23:24.333,"First the pot, then this."
00:23:24.333,00:23:25.917,The pot?
00:23:28.792,00:23:31.917,You told me the kid was smoking.
00:23:31.917,00:23:33.375,"I mean, you may as well have."
00:23:33.375,00:23:36.709,"I wasn't talking about Walter, Jr."
00:23:36.709,00:23:39.875,I was-- I was talking about Walt.
00:23:40.959,00:23:43.834,Excuse me?
00:23:43.834,00:23:46.500,He admitted it.
00:23:46.500,00:23:49.875,He said he liked it.
00:23:49.875,00:23:51.542,Walt?
00:23:51.542,00:23:53.083,Mm-hm.
00:23:55.500,00:23:58.875,Shit.
00:24:01.458,00:24:03.917,I didn't think he had it in him.
00:24:03.917,00:24:06.417,It's like he's not himself lately.
00:24:06.417,00:24:11.250,"I mean, why would anyone in their right mind choose not to do treatment?"
00:24:11.250,00:24:14.041,Especially when it's completely paid for.
00:24:14.041,00:24:16.166,Why is he doing this?
00:24:19.291,00:24:24.875,"What we really need to do is sit him down, all of us, and-- And get everything out on the table."
00:24:24.875,00:24:27.417,Talk it all through.
00:24:27.417,00:24:30.792,You mean an in--? Intervention?
00:24:30.792,00:24:34.208,Just a family meeting.
00:24:34.208,00:24:39.959,Where everyone can voice their concerns and be heard.
00:24:47.792,00:24:50.208,"BADGER: You are a genius, bro."
00:24:50.208,00:24:52.333,This cankenstein is unreal.
00:24:52.333,00:24:56.792,"When we get back, I'm gonna burn that dollar bill suit, 'cause we're gonna make some mad dough."
00:24:58.834,00:25:01.041,It's not right.
00:25:01.041,00:25:03.542,"What do you mean, it's not right?"
00:25:03.542,00:25:08.041,Tsk. It's...cloudy.
00:25:10.959,00:25:16.208,"So what? Cloudy, not cloudy?"
00:25:17.875,00:25:20.000,Good enough.
00:25:21.792,00:25:25.250,"Wait, wait."
00:25:29.250,00:25:31.667,Argh!
00:25:31.667,00:25:33.333,I totally would've smoked that.
00:25:33.333,00:25:35.667,"Look, it's not for you, it's for our customers."
00:25:35.667,00:25:37.792,They're gonna demand a certain standard.
00:25:37.792,00:25:40.792,What? What--?
00:25:40.792,00:25:43.625,What?
00:25:43.625,00:25:45.834,Until we get it right.
00:26:09.792,00:26:11.333,Walt.
00:26:13.291,00:26:15.917,Please have a seat and join us.
00:27:06.917,00:27:08.375,We can do better.
00:27:08.375,00:27:10.083,Don't you fucking think about it!
00:27:10.083,00:27:11.875,Hey.
00:27:14.583,00:27:16.458,Three entire pounds of pseudo wasted.
00:27:16.458,00:27:18.792,Do you know how long I had to spin that stupid sign?
00:27:18.792,00:27:22.834,"Get off me, psycho."
00:27:31.750,00:27:33.834,God! Argh!
00:27:37.834,00:27:38.750,Asshole.
00:27:41.417,00:27:42.917,Open the door.
00:28:04.542,00:28:07.750,"BADGER: Come back here, you bitch!"
00:28:07.750,00:28:09.417,I'm gonna mess you up!
00:28:21.792,00:28:27.750,"I really need to understand your thought process, because clearly I don't."
00:28:38.792,00:28:44.458,"Look, Skyler-- SKYLER: Not yet, please. I-- I have the talking pillow."
00:28:47.333,00:28:49.834,"Everybody gets to speak their minds, remember?"
00:28:49.834,00:28:52.834,And then you'll get your chance.
00:28:52.834,00:28:57.500,"Money has always been an issue for us, I'll give you that."
00:28:57.500,00:29:03.583,"But now that Elliott is more than willing to pitch in-- Walt, I know, I understand that it's hard for you to accept help."
00:29:03.583,00:29:05.834,Maybe it's the way you were raised.
00:29:05.834,00:29:12.000,"But, honey, it's okay to lean on people now and again."
00:29:12.000,00:29:14.583,You need this treatment.
00:29:14.583,00:29:19.542,And nothing can stop you from getting it except you.
00:29:26.792,00:29:30.542,Am I allowed to respond?
00:29:30.542,00:29:34.542,I think we need to go around the circle first.
00:29:36.375,00:29:38.834,"Hank, would you like to start?"
00:29:41.834,00:29:45.792,"Uh, yeah. Okay, well..."
00:29:45.792,00:29:48.500,What I would say is-- Take-- Take the talking pillow.
00:29:55.041,00:29:57.875,"All right, look, buddy, um..."
00:29:57.875,00:30:06.333,"I know I don't get to tell you this enough, but, uh, I care about you."
00:30:06.333,00:30:09.667,A hell of a lot.
00:30:09.667,00:30:11.750,And this cancer thing...
00:30:11.750,00:30:16.250,"Let's just-- Let's face it, you know, you were dealt a shit hand."
00:30:20.250,00:30:29.458,"I mean-- I mean, I can't tell you how many times I was-- You know, I started with a shit hand, and I ended up with a, you know, a full house. Okay?"
00:30:29.458,00:30:31.792,"I mean, the key is, you gotta hang in there."
00:30:31.792,00:30:36.667,"Man, you gotta keep placing your bets, keep placing your bets."
00:30:37.750,00:30:40.834,"Hank, what the hell are you saying?"
00:30:40.834,00:30:42.667,"SKYLER: No, please, Marie, let him talk."
00:30:42.667,00:30:46.667,That's what we're here to do.
00:30:46.667,00:30:49.417,"Go on, Hank."
00:30:49.417,00:30:53.750,"All right, l-- Look at it this way, okay?"
00:30:53.750,00:30:58.834,"It's the bottom of the ninth, bases are loaded, you're up."
00:30:58.834,00:31:01.792,"But you got a bum arm, right?"
00:31:01.792,00:31:05.000,"There's no fricking way you're gonna hit a homer, okay?"
00:31:05.000,00:31:13.166,"So you can either let the pinch hitter take the bat, or you can hold on to your pride and lose the game."
00:31:13.166,00:31:15.417,You get what I'm saying?
00:31:16.542,00:31:17.917,No.
00:31:20.625,00:31:23.500,"You got your pride, man."
00:31:23.500,00:31:26.417,"But this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in, man."
00:31:26.417,00:31:27.959,I'm-- I'm with your old lady on this one.
00:31:27.959,00:31:30.250,"I say take the money and run, man."
00:31:33.875,00:31:36.291,Somebody wanna take this thing?
00:31:36.291,00:31:43.875,"Y-yes, Walter-- Walter, Jr., I'm-- I'm sure that you have about a million things to say, probably."
00:31:43.875,00:31:47.125,And now is your chance.
00:31:47.125,00:31:50.917,Go ahead. Just let it all out.
00:31:54.709,00:31:56.792,"All right, come on."
00:31:56.792,00:32:03.625,It-- Talk.
00:32:03.625,00:32:06.083,Tell your dad how you feel.
00:32:08.834,00:32:11.875,I'm pissed off.
00:32:11.875,00:32:15.208,I-I'm pissed off.
00:32:15.208,00:32:18.625,'Cause you're being-- You're being...
00:32:25.667,00:32:29.458,"You're, like, ready to give up."
00:32:31.166,00:32:34.834,You're-- God.
00:32:34.834,00:32:37.583,"What if you gave up on me, huh?"
00:32:43.166,00:32:51.959,"This here, all the stuff I've been through, and y-you're scared of a little chemotherapy?"
00:33:06.458,00:33:09.000,"Me, personally..."
00:33:10.875,00:33:13.917,I think you should do whatever you wanna do.
00:33:15.542,00:33:17.792,What?
00:33:17.792,00:33:20.375,You told us to be honest about our feelings.
00:33:20.375,00:33:22.875,"Walt's the one with cancer, it's his decision."
00:33:24.792,00:33:29.625,Why in hell would you do this?
00:33:29.625,00:33:32.834,I wasn't planning on agreeing with Walt.
00:33:32.834,00:33:41.667,But after sitting and listening to you all talk about his future like he has no say in it-- He's not gonna have a future if he doesn't get treatment.
00:33:41.667,00:33:44.834,I am a medical professional.
00:33:44.834,00:33:48.792,I x-ray people in treatment every day.
00:33:48.792,00:33:51.709,I see them every day.
00:33:51.709,00:33:54.792,Some of them are absolutely miserable.
00:33:54.792,00:33:58.500,"Marie-- I'm sorry, but it's true."
00:33:58.500,00:34:05.875,And some of them don't wanna spend their last weeks or months being picked at by doctors.
00:34:05.875,00:34:08.583,But they got talked into it by their families.
00:34:08.583,00:34:10.667,Can I get the pillow back?
00:34:10.667,00:34:12.291,Thank you.
00:34:10.667,00:34:14.417,"SKYLER: Hank-- What? Maybe Walt wants to die like a man, all right?"
00:34:14.417,00:34:17.166,I don't want him to die at all!
00:34:20.667,00:34:26.417,"Skyler, I just wanted to do you the courtesy of giving you my honest opinion."
00:34:26.417,00:34:30.208,"You know, Marie, this is not debate club."
00:34:30.208,00:34:41.875,"This is my husband's life-- I made one simple observation-- And it's like you-- How dare you-- Okay, so we disagree-- Ladies! Marie!"
00:34:43.875,00:34:46.375,This is so stupid.
00:34:50.792,00:34:53.000,"All right, I've got the talking pillow now."
00:34:54.291,00:34:55.834,Okay?
00:35:06.250,00:35:11.959,"We all, in this room, we love each other."
00:35:11.959,00:35:15.875,"We want what's best for each other, and I know that."
00:35:15.875,00:35:18.917,I am very thankful for that.
00:35:19.875,00:35:29.500,"But what I want-- What I want, what I need..."
00:35:30.750,00:35:33.834,is a choice.
00:35:33.834,00:35:39.667,What does that mean?
00:35:39.667,00:35:50.917,"Sometimes I feel like I never actually make any of my own choices, I mean."
00:35:56.542,00:35:58.166,My entire life...
00:35:59.667,00:36:01.959,it just seems I never...
00:36:04.792,00:36:09.250,"you know, had a-- Had a real say about any of it."
00:36:12.166,00:36:15.625,"Now, this last one, cancer..."
00:36:21.792,00:36:25.583,"SKYLER: Then make the right choice, Walt."
00:36:25.583,00:36:29.250,You are not the only one it affects.
00:36:29.250,00:36:32.834,What about your son?
00:36:32.834,00:36:36.709,Don't you wanna see your daughter grow up? I just...
00:36:41.875,00:36:44.041,Of course I do.
00:36:45.750,00:36:50.417,"Skyler, you've read the statistics, you..."
00:36:55.667,00:37:05.500,"These doctors talking about surviving one year, two years, like it's the only thing that matters."
00:37:05.500,00:37:13.709,But what good is it to just survive if I am too sick to work?
00:37:13.709,00:37:16.083,To enjoy a meal?
00:37:18.250,00:37:20.125,To make love?
00:37:26.959,00:37:34.709,"For what time I have left, I wanna live in my own house."
00:37:34.709,00:37:37.583,I wanna sleep in my own bed.
00:37:37.583,00:37:47.667,"I don't wanna choke down 30 or 40 pills every single day and lose my hair and lie around, too tired to get up..."
00:37:49.625,00:37:53.875,and so nauseated that I can't even move my head.
00:37:55.875,00:37:57.834,And you.
00:37:57.834,00:38:00.792,Cleaning up after me.
00:38:02.834,00:38:05.500,And me? What--?
00:38:05.500,00:38:16.208,"Some, uh-- Some dead man, some artificially-alive-- Just marking time."
00:38:17.792,00:38:19.917,No. No.
00:38:32.625,00:38:34.917,That's the worst part.
00:38:37.750,00:38:43.917,"So that is my thought process, Skyler."
00:38:45.542,00:38:48.458,I'm sorry. I just...
00:38:52.375,00:38:55.917,I choose not to do it.
00:40:50.125,00:40:51.917,All right.
00:40:54.959,00:40:57.500,All right what?
00:41:00.458,00:41:02.917,I'll do the treatment.
00:41:33.834,00:41:36.792,It's gonna be okay.
00:41:36.792,00:41:38.125,Okay.
00:42:03.875,00:42:08.834,"Um, the lady from the billing office said they usually bill the insurance company directly."
00:42:08.834,00:42:14.375,"But since our HMO's not paying for it, we can pay up front with a credit card."
00:42:14.375,00:42:16.792,"Oh, good."
00:42:16.792,00:42:21.583,"Oh, and then Elliott will send a check. Right."
00:42:21.583,00:42:24.542,I will take care of it.
00:42:29.291,00:42:31.208,Walter White?
00:42:31.208,00:42:33.208,Yes.
00:42:35.417,00:42:37.792,Okay. Heh-heh!
00:42:37.792,00:42:39.291,All right.
00:42:39.291,00:42:40.834,See you in a minute.
00:42:40.834,00:42:42.333,Okay.
00:44:12.542,00:44:14.709,Ha-ha! Elliott.
00:44:18.792,00:44:20.417,"Oh, hey."
00:44:20.417,00:44:22.083,"Hey, Gretchen, how are you?"
00:44:22.083,00:44:26.291,"You know, it was-- It was really great seeing you two the other day, you know."
00:44:26.291,00:44:29.792,"Wow, what a party."
00:44:29.792,00:44:33.458,"Um, Elliott told me about the cancer."
00:44:33.458,00:44:36.875,I-I-I'm-- I'm so sorry.
00:44:38.542,00:44:42.583,"Well, you know, it is what it is, I guess."
00:44:42.583,00:44:44.917,I don't-- I don't know what to say.
00:44:44.917,00:44:48.000,"Except, I'm always here for you."
00:44:48.000,00:44:52.041,Both of us are.
00:44:53.417,00:44:56.000,"Yeah, well, thank you."
00:44:57.250,00:45:02.291,"Walt, Elliott told me that he'd offered to pay for the treatment."
00:45:02.291,00:45:03.792,You have to accept.
00:45:03.792,00:45:08.750,"That money, as far as we're both concerned, that-- That belongs to you."
00:45:08.750,00:45:12.458,"Even the name of our company, it-- It's-- It's half yours."
00:45:14.750,00:45:16.041,Walt?
00:45:18.875,00:45:22.625,Is this about you and me?
00:45:33.959,00:45:36.750,"Gretchen, I really appreciate the offer."
00:45:36.750,00:45:39.792,"I do. Um, but we're fine."
00:45:39.792,00:45:41.375,Uh...
00:45:41.375,00:45:44.959,"As it turns out, the insurance came through after all."
00:45:44.959,00:45:50.792,"So, um, I am covered. And, uh..."
00:45:50.792,00:45:53.959,"Well, and, anyway, I-I-I really appreciate it, I really do."
00:45:53.959,00:45:56.583,Thank you.
00:45:56.583,00:45:59.125,Good. That's good news.
00:46:00.750,00:46:03.917,"You know, that really was a-- A great party."
00:46:06.792,00:46:11.834,"Keep in touch, okay?"
00:46:11.834,00:46:13.917,thank you for calling.
00:47:12.709,00:47:14.417,Wanna cook?
00:00:51.301,00:00:52.803,Let's get something straight.
00:00:52.803,00:00:56.557,"This, the chemistry, is my realm."
00:00:56.557,00:00:58.642,I am in charge of the cooking.
00:00:58.642,00:01:01.812,"Out there on the street, you deal with that."
00:01:04.439,00:01:07.860,"As far as our customers go, I don't want to know anything about them."
00:01:07.860,00:01:10.404,"I don't wanna see them, I don't wanna hear them."
00:01:10.404,00:01:14.449,I want no interaction with them whatsoever.
00:01:16.827,00:01:21.206,"This operation is you and me, and I'm the silent partner."
00:01:21.206,00:01:23.042,You got any issues with that?
00:01:24.334,00:01:26.169,"Whatever, man."
00:01:32.051,00:01:37.096,"No matter what happens, no more bloodshed."
00:01:38.306,00:01:39.683,No violence.
00:02:33.695,00:02:35.697,Walt?
00:02:35.697,00:02:38.366,You all right?
00:02:38.366,00:02:41.328,"Yeah, I'm okay."
00:02:41.328,00:02:45.040,"You know, honey, you-- You really don't have to..."
00:02:46.166,00:02:49.544,"Look, I like being here with you."
00:02:49.544,00:02:52.006,Yeah.
00:02:52.006,00:02:55.216,"I'm only saying that, you know, I'd be okay."
00:02:55.216,00:02:57.761,"That, really, if you wanna go..."
00:02:59.262,00:03:07.354,"You know, actually, it would make me feel a little better knowing that you were there when Walter Jr."
00:03:11.274,00:03:12.985,Okay.
00:03:14.862,00:03:17.072,All right. So you'll call me when you're finished?
00:03:17.072,00:03:18.991,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:21.702,00:03:25.122,"Oh, and have you been in touch with Elliot?"
00:03:25.122,00:03:28.917,Because I haven't seen a check from him.
00:03:28.917,00:03:30.919,"Yes, I-- I got it."
00:03:30.919,00:03:34.339,Really?
00:03:30.919,00:03:39.803,"It came, yeah. And I-- Yeah, it did. It came last week and I put it right into my credit union account."
00:03:39.803,00:03:42.764,So I'm taking care of it.
00:03:44.265,00:03:46.309,Good.
00:03:46.309,00:03:49.437,So we're good. We're good.
00:03:51.815,00:03:57.654,Could you not deposit this until Monday?
00:03:59.322,00:04:00.615,Thank you.
00:04:01.783,00:04:05.162,"Call if the discomfort's too much, otherwise we'll see you next week."
00:04:06.329,00:04:07.915,Yeah.
00:04:27.893,00:04:35.692,Chemical reactions involve change on two levels: matter and energy.
00:04:35.692,00:04:41.531,"When a reaction is gradual, the change in energy is slight."
00:04:41.531,00:04:45.493,"I mean, you-- You don't even notice the reaction is happening."
00:04:45.493,00:04:50.832,"For example, when rust collects on the underside of a car."
00:04:50.832,00:04:52.417,Right?
00:04:56.671,00:05:08.600,"But if a reaction happens quickly, otherwise harmless substances can interact in a way that generates enormous bursts of energy."
00:05:10.060,00:05:11.311,All right.
00:05:11.311,00:05:18.235,"Uh, who can give me an example of rapid chemical reaction?"
00:05:24.074,00:05:26.409,"Hint, hint. Right here."
00:05:26.409,00:05:28.870,"Like, an explosion?"
00:05:30.038,00:05:33.292,"Yes, good. Explosions."
00:05:33.292,00:05:40.590,Explosions are the result of chemical reactions happening almost instantaneously.
00:05:40.590,00:05:48.265,"And the faster reactants, i.e. explosives-- And fulminative mercury is a prime example of that."
00:05:48.265,00:05:54.146,"--the faster they undergo change, the more violent the explosion."
00:05:58.817,00:06:00.527,Explosions.
00:06:00.527,00:06:07.117,"Okay, listen, why don't you start reading on your own from the top of chapter seven."
00:06:07.117,00:06:08.743,All right?
00:06:22.341,00:06:23.800,HUGO: You okay?
00:06:24.968,00:06:27.262,"I got it, Mr. White."
00:06:27.262,00:06:29.139,Don't worry.
00:06:29.139,00:06:31.390,You got kids to teach.
00:06:51.786,00:06:53.830,"Thanks, Hugo."
00:07:04.591,00:07:12.224,"SKYLER: He's starting to lose weight which is, um, tough, to see that."
00:07:12.224,00:07:17.354,"I can already feel the difference when I put my, uh, arms around him."
00:07:25.112,00:07:26.571,Can I talk to--?
00:07:26.571,00:07:28.365,Of course.
00:07:28.365,00:07:31.492,Walt.
00:07:31.492,00:07:36.915,"When you don't let me in, when you don't tell me what's going on..."
00:07:36.915,00:07:40.835,"I mean, it's like I feel like you don't even want me around sometimes."
00:07:40.835,00:07:42.879,No.
00:07:42.879,00:07:54.515,"And-- And-- And recently, these-- These afternoons when you're coming home so late and we're just left wondering where you are."
00:07:55.475,00:07:56.893,"WALT JR.: Yeah, Dad."
00:07:58.728,00:08:00.397,What's up with that?
00:08:01.856,00:08:07.946,"Walt, is there anything else you're holding back from your family?"
00:08:11.074,00:08:13.785,Now's the time to share.
00:08:15.954,00:08:19.374,"Well, I..."
00:08:21.042,00:08:25.255,"I-I like to be alone, I mean, at times."
00:08:25.255,00:08:28.925,"And it's not about you, really."
00:08:28.925,00:08:42.481,"It's just that sometimes it feels better not to talk at all, about anything, to anyone."
00:08:42.481,00:08:45.859,Alone time can be helpful.
00:08:47.861,00:08:59.622,Maybe knowing what you do when you're alone might make it easier for your family to be more accepting of whatever it is you do alone.
00:09:01.124,00:09:07.755,"Well, I like to go on walks."
00:09:07.755,00:09:12.802,"A couple of times a week, maybe more, after work."
00:09:12.802,00:09:19.309,And I-I really enjoy the nature.
00:09:19.309,00:09:26.066,"You know, the cacti, vegetation, that kind of thing."
00:09:28.109,00:09:32.322,"It's really very, very therapeutic."
00:10:02.227,00:10:04.438,"Yo, God, are you okay?"
00:10:04.438,00:10:07.315,"Hey, you did that shit?"
00:10:07.315,00:10:10.110,I'm just dizzy. I need air.
00:10:10.110,00:10:12.946,"God, I feel like I'm burning up."
00:10:12.946,00:10:14.531,I gotta-- Take this off.
00:10:17.909,00:10:19.453,"Sit down, get some air."
00:10:21.162,00:10:22.372,"Oh, God."
00:10:22.372,00:10:23.623,Oh.
00:10:23.623,00:10:25.208,Here.
00:10:28.711,00:10:29.963,Better?
00:10:29.963,00:10:31.298,"Yeah, that's better."
00:10:32.591,00:10:34.759,Oh.
00:10:36.844,00:10:38.096,Oh.
00:10:38.096,00:10:40.181,When were you gonna tell me?
00:10:42.892,00:10:45.186,Tell you what?
00:10:45.186,00:10:47.105,Cancer.
00:10:47.105,00:10:48.482,"You got it, right?"
00:10:56.239,00:10:57.907,How did you know?
00:10:57.907,00:11:04.080,My aunt had one of those dots on her to target the radiation.
00:11:04.080,00:11:05.415,"What, is it in your lung?"
00:11:07.417,00:11:09.544,"I'm your partner, man, you should have told me."
00:11:10.545,00:11:11.796,"God, that's not cool, okay?"
00:11:11.796,00:11:13.131,Not at all.
00:11:16.176,00:11:17.511,What stage are you?
00:11:19.804,00:11:21.306,Three-A.
00:11:23.350,00:11:25.477,Gone into your lymph nodes.
00:11:37.989,00:11:40.241,Your aunt.
00:11:40.241,00:11:42.494,How-how bad was she when they caught it?
00:11:43.786,00:11:46.039,"Bad enough, she didn't last long."
00:11:48.124,00:11:49.668,How long?
00:11:49.668,00:11:51.836,Seven months.
00:11:56.132,00:11:57.925,God.
00:11:57.925,00:11:59.718,I get it now.
00:11:59.718,00:12:01.262,That's why you're doing all this.
00:12:01.262,00:12:05.766,You want to make some cash for your people before you check out.
00:12:05.766,00:12:07.018,You got a problem with that?
00:12:07.018,00:12:08.228,You tell me.
00:12:08.228,00:12:11.147,You're the one that looks like he just crawled out of a microwave.
00:12:16.944,00:12:19.573,You gonna be able to finish the batch?
00:12:19.573,00:12:20.781,Yes.
00:12:20.781,00:12:22.825,All right.
00:12:26.829,00:12:28.582,No.
00:12:29.165,00:12:30.500,You do it.
00:12:33.587,00:12:34.837,Me?
00:12:34.837,00:12:37.465,Yeah.
00:12:37.465,00:12:40.885,What happened to your mad skills?
00:12:47.016,00:12:49.269,Go on. Here.
00:12:49.269,00:12:51.020,You do it.
00:12:54.190,00:12:55.483,You can do it.
00:13:01.281,00:13:04.367,"If you have any questions, I'll be right out here."
00:13:09.664,00:13:14.586,"The next time, put an ice pack on your head during chemo."
00:13:14.586,00:13:17.130,My aunt said it helped with the hair loss.
00:13:54.584,00:13:57.920,"What's this, Christmas?"
00:13:59.880,00:14:02.550,This that one we found way out in the boonies at the cook site?
00:14:06.805,00:14:09.015,Holy shit.
00:14:09.015,00:14:12.811,HANK: Lab says they pulled up an imprint of some old writing used to be on the inside.
00:14:12.811,00:14:14.103,Magic Marker or something.
00:14:14.103,00:14:15.563,Yeah? What's it say?
00:14:15.563,00:14:19.567,Property of J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab.
00:14:19.567,00:14:20.860,That's Walt's school.
00:15:39.188,00:15:41.775,We were supposed to start at 3.
00:15:41.775,00:15:45.528,"Hey, I'm out there making fat stacks, man. Chill."
00:15:45.528,00:15:50.116,"Hey, prepaid cell phone. Use it."
00:15:57.457,00:15:58.708,How much is this?
00:15:58.708,00:16:01.168,Twenty-six big ones.
00:16:01.168,00:16:04.422,Is that all?
00:16:04.422,00:16:11.846,"Uh, no, that's 2600, and your share is 13, minus 25 bucks for that phone."
00:16:11.846,00:16:14.014,How much meth did you sell?
00:16:14.014,00:16:15.391,Nearly an ounce.
00:16:19.479,00:16:22.356,Last time I checked there were 16 ounces to a pound.
00:16:22.356,00:16:24.484,"What did you do with the rest, smoke it?"
00:16:24.484,00:16:27.027,"Yo, I've been out all night slinging crystal."
00:16:27.027,00:16:30.657,You think it's cake moving a pound of meth one teenth at a time?
00:16:30.657,00:16:32.742,Why are you selling it in such small quantities?
00:16:32.742,00:16:35.119,Why don't you just sell the whole pound at once?
00:16:35.119,00:16:37.246,To who?
00:16:37.246,00:16:41.793,This is unacceptable.
00:16:41.793,00:16:44.337,This return is too little for the risk.
00:16:44.337,00:16:46.506,I thought you'd be ready for another pound today.
00:16:46.506,00:16:51.218,"You may know a lot about chemistry, man, but you don't know jack about slinging dope."
00:16:51.218,00:16:54.889,"Well, I'll tell you, I know a lack of motivation when I see it."
00:16:54.889,00:16:57.016,"Oh, my..."
00:16:57.016,00:17:03.773,"Come on, you've gotta be more imaginative, you know, just-- Just think outside the box here."
00:17:03.773,00:17:07.234,"We have to move our product in bulk, wholesale."
00:17:07.234,00:17:10.237,"Now, how do we do that?"
00:17:12.239,00:17:13.867,"What, do you mean to a distributor?"
00:17:13.867,00:17:15.785,"Yes. Yes, that's what we need."
00:17:15.785,00:17:16.995,We need a distributor.
00:17:16.995,00:17:19.246,"Now, do you know anyone like that?"
00:17:19.246,00:17:22.625,"Yeah, I mean, I used to, until you killed him."
00:17:36.430,00:17:40.518,So who took Krazy-8's place?
00:17:40.518,00:17:43.354,Some guy named Tuco.
00:17:43.354,00:17:44.772,"Badass, from what I hear."
00:17:44.772,00:17:49.527,"Tuco, okay."
00:17:49.527,00:17:52.697,"Right. Like, Hello, sir."
00:17:49.527,00:17:56.075,"Hey, I know you don't know me, but would you be interested in a felony quantity of methamphetamine?"
00:17:56.075,00:17:59.453,"Well, yes, but maybe with a little more salesmanship, perhaps?"
00:17:59.453,00:18:01.455,"You just don't get it, man, okay? This guy's OG."
00:18:01.455,00:18:03.666,What-- What does that mean?
00:18:03.666,00:18:05.292,"Jesus, look, he's off our level, man."
00:18:05.292,00:18:08.462,He's not gonna do business with some dude he doesn't know.
00:18:08.462,00:18:11.049,You just don't understand the way it works.
00:18:11.049,00:18:15.929,You can't just bum-rush some high-level ice man and start cutting deals.
00:18:15.929,00:18:17.263,Okay? It's risky.
00:18:17.263,00:18:19.724,"You need an intro, you need someone to vouch."
00:18:19.724,00:18:22.435,"Well, who introduced you to Krazy-8?"
00:18:22.435,00:18:28.691,"Emilio, and that's only because I knew him from third grade, and we can't talk to Emilio, because-- All right, all right, all right."
00:18:28.691,00:18:34.280,"Look, I'm telling you, Mr. White, it's too risky. Okay?"
00:18:34.280,00:18:35.782,"I mean, we're making money."
00:18:35.782,00:18:38.117,Why can't you be satisfied with the way it is?
00:18:38.117,00:18:39.410,"Oh, come on! Jesus!"
00:18:39.410,00:18:41.287,Just grow some fucking balls!
00:19:23.329,00:19:24.747,Wait till Monday again?
00:19:24.747,00:19:27.541,"Yes, please. Thank you."
00:19:37.635,00:19:39.553,"Oh, God."
00:19:57.864,00:19:59.281,HUGO: Mr. White.
00:20:05.746,00:20:07.832,"Thank you, Hugo."
00:20:16.841,00:20:34.316,"Uh-- Knock, knock."
00:20:34.316,00:20:36.402,"How you feeling, Walt?"
00:20:36.402,00:20:38.905,Good. Yeah.
00:20:38.905,00:20:41.991,Are you up for having a visitor?
00:20:41.991,00:20:43.659,"Hey, buddy."
00:20:43.659,00:20:45.327,H-Hank.
00:20:45.327,00:20:47.580,"Well, let me know if you need anything."
00:20:47.580,00:20:49.123,"I will. Thank you, Carmen."
00:20:51.667,00:20:53.502,Damn.
00:20:53.502,00:20:56.714,"Chick's got an ass like an onion, makes me wanna cry."
00:20:58.174,00:21:01.427,"So, what--?"
00:21:01.427,00:21:06.015,"Well, I had some questions I wanted to run by you, work-related."
00:21:06.015,00:21:07.850,You feeling okay?
00:21:07.850,00:21:10.978,"No, no, no, I'm fine."
00:21:10.978,00:21:14.899,"What do you mean, work-related, though?"
00:21:16.150,00:21:18.444,Do you recognize that?
00:21:22.531,00:21:24.575,No. No.
00:21:25.868,00:21:28.913,"Well, that was used to cook meth."
00:21:28.913,00:21:32.959,Found it out on some Indian land about 40 miles from here.
00:21:32.959,00:21:39.132,Old label on the inside used to say: J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab.
00:21:39.132,00:21:40.507,Really?
00:21:40.507,00:21:43.136,I don't understand how that came from here.
00:21:43.136,00:21:45.263,"Well, I was hoping you could help me with that."
00:21:45.263,00:21:48.557,We found it near an abandoned car that belonged to one of our snitches.
00:21:51.936,00:21:53.271,A snitch?
00:21:53.271,00:21:55.606,"Yeah, one of our confidential informants."
00:21:55.606,00:21:57.150,Went missing a while back.
00:21:57.150,00:22:04.615,"No body yet, but we're pretty sure, you know: Probably chopped up into little pieces and fed to the buzzards."
00:22:04.615,00:22:06.826,Ugh.
00:22:06.826,00:22:10.913,"Anyway, you-- Any respirators like that go missing lately?"
00:22:10.913,00:22:12.206,Uh-uh.
00:22:12.206,00:22:14.917,No. No.
00:22:14.917,00:22:17.295,"No, I mean, not that I know of."
00:22:17.295,00:22:18.963,I'll need to look at that inventory.
00:22:18.963,00:22:22.675,Sure. Sure. I've got a list hanging on the wall.
00:22:22.675,00:22:25.178,Do you mind if I take a look at your storeroom?
00:22:25.178,00:22:27.221,Not at all. No.
00:22:27.221,00:22:28.514,Be my guest.
00:22:32.518,00:22:34.520,"All right, so who's got keys?"
00:22:34.520,00:22:40.985,"The science faculty, the staff, Carmen, the vice-principal has the master, and me."
00:22:40.985,00:22:43.196,How about students?
00:22:43.196,00:22:46.282,"Uh, no, no."
00:22:46.282,00:22:47.658,"Shit, I should hope not."
00:22:47.658,00:22:50.995,My question is do any of the little pissants know where you keep 'em?
00:22:50.995,00:22:52.913,"Uh, I don't-- I don't think so, no."
00:22:52.913,00:23:01.547,"I mean, besides, I keep them right here in my pocket anyway, so-- Walt, look, I know they're your students, but do not underestimate them."
00:23:01.547,00:23:03.090,Are there any other respirators?
00:23:03.090,00:23:04.925,"Um, no."
00:23:04.925,00:23:07.761,"Because I'm counting six, uh, inventory says eight."
00:23:07.761,00:23:10.472,Hm.
00:23:10.472,00:23:12.850,Glassware looking a little sparse.
00:23:12.850,00:23:14.643,Is it?
00:23:14.643,00:23:20.358,"Yeah. You're missing a couple of Erlenmeyer flasks, at least."
00:23:20.358,00:23:22.693,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:22.693,00:23:25.905,A 5000 milliliter round-bottom.
00:23:25.905,00:23:28.490,Meth heads love to brew in this baby.
00:23:30.243,00:23:31.660,You gonna answer that?
00:23:31.660,00:23:35.998,"Oh, no, it's just-- No, I don't-- Maybe it's Skyler, she's in trouble or something."
00:23:35.998,00:23:37.583,"Shit, don't ignore it on my account."
00:23:37.583,00:23:39.459,"Answer it. Come on, I got stuff to do."
00:23:40.753,00:23:42.420,Jeez.
00:23:44.006,00:23:45.423,Hello?
00:23:45.423,00:23:48.177,"Yo, what's up, Mr. W?"
00:23:48.177,00:23:49.803,"Uh, speaking."
00:23:49.803,00:23:51.264,Bad time to talk?
00:23:51.264,00:23:52.639,Absolutely.
00:23:52.639,00:23:54.141,"All right, so just listen."
00:23:54.141,00:23:57.353,"So you know that guy we were talking about, Tuco?"
00:23:57.353,00:24:02.858,"Turns out my boy, Skinny Pete, was in the same cell block with him over at Los Lunas."
00:24:02.858,00:24:07.154,So we got our in. We're hauling a pound to the dude right now.
00:24:07.154,00:24:11.575,"Okay, then. Well, thank you."
00:24:12.952,00:24:16.622,"Ha. My, uh, doctor is very solicitous."
00:24:16.622,00:24:18.082,"Hey, look, buddy."
00:24:18.082,00:24:23.254,"The last thing I wanna do is get you in hot water, but some meth-monkey had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?"
00:24:23.254,00:24:26.173,You gotta keep better watch over your turf.
00:24:26.173,00:24:27.883,I will.
00:24:27.883,00:24:31.095,"We don't want people to start wondering about you, right?"
00:24:38.227,00:24:41.688,Right. No. Right.
00:24:45.109,00:24:47.361,So you're sure you're tight with this guy?
00:24:47.361,00:24:49.155,"Two nuts in a ball sack, yo."
00:25:06.005,00:25:08.548,"Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete."
00:25:17.350,00:25:20.311,"Maybe this isn't such a good idea, yo. Come on."
00:25:24.731,00:25:27.567,"Yeah, man, that's what's happening."
00:25:40.498,00:25:43.209,"Yo, Tuco's expecting us."
00:25:52.718,00:25:55.346,"No need, man."
00:26:09.527,00:26:13.197,"Tuco, what's happening, my brother?"
00:26:18.785,00:26:20.871,"Sick crib, yo."
00:26:20.871,00:26:23.082,You've been keeping it real since you been sprung.
00:26:23.082,00:26:24.417,"What's it been, like, a year?"
00:26:24.417,00:26:26.085,This your boy?
00:26:26.085,00:26:29.129,"Yeah, Jesse. Dude with the glass I was telling you about."
00:26:29.129,00:26:31.382,"Hey, man, yeah."
00:26:32.716,00:26:34.093,Break out the ice.
00:26:50.859,00:26:52.152,Take a bump.
00:26:52.152,00:26:53.946,"No worries, man, I'm no cop."
00:26:55.864,00:26:57.741,"I said, hit it."
00:27:00.536,00:27:01.954,All right.
00:27:14.508,00:27:15.717,Booyah!
00:27:15.717,00:27:17.428,Whoo!
00:27:17.428,00:27:20.889,This kicks like a mule with his balls wrapped in duct tape.
00:27:20.889,00:27:22.558,Whoo!
00:27:22.558,00:27:23.850,Where'd you get it?
00:27:23.850,00:27:25.060,I cooked it.
00:27:26.520,00:27:27.980,Bullshit.
00:27:28.981,00:27:31.691,Who you working for?
00:27:31.691,00:27:33.402,"No one, man."
00:27:33.402,00:27:36.363,"I mean, I have a partner that I cook with, but that's it."
00:27:39.866,00:27:42.119,All right.
00:27:42.119,00:27:43.996,Aw.
00:27:43.996,00:27:45.247,We got a deal.
00:27:45.247,00:27:47.874,"See, I told you Tuco would hook you up."
00:27:47.874,00:27:50.961,Cool. I haven't said how much.
00:27:53.964,00:27:55.924,TUCO: Aw.
00:27:59.803,00:28:02.848,All right. How much?
00:28:02.848,00:28:04.850,Thirty-five large for the pound.
00:28:09.062,00:28:12.816,"Well, you're a little light, ese."
00:28:16.362,00:28:18.572,"It's all right, don't sweat it."
00:28:18.572,00:28:20.698,It's good.
00:28:21.867,00:28:23.160,What about the money?
00:28:23.160,00:28:24.786,You'll get it.
00:28:24.786,00:28:26.580,This is a consignment operation.
00:28:27.956,00:28:29.875,You want me to float 35 G's?
00:28:33.212,00:28:34.838,You don't trust me?
00:28:34.838,00:28:37.299,"Hey, no, no, hey."
00:28:37.299,00:28:40.427,"It's just, you know, I don't-- I don't do business that way."
00:28:40.427,00:28:43.347,"Tough shit, the deal is done."
00:28:45.474,00:28:49.687,"You said this was cool, okay?"
00:28:49.687,00:28:53.232,"Don't front, dude, Tuco's good for it."
00:28:53.232,00:28:56.193,I don't need your punk ass to vouch for me.
00:29:00.364,00:29:02.949,Come on.
00:29:02.949,00:29:05.369,"Oh, come on."
00:29:15.795,00:29:17.339,TUCO: All right.
00:29:17.339,00:29:21.260,You brought me some really clean crystal. Whoo!
00:29:23.136,00:29:24.804,You really want your money up front?
00:29:49.371,00:29:50.664,Up front.
00:30:20.860,00:30:25.741,"Nobody moves crystal in the South Valley but me, bitch."
00:30:45.636,00:30:46.928,"Morning, Hugo."
00:30:48.888,00:30:52.017,"You don't mind if I call you Hugo, Hugo?"
00:30:55.813,00:30:58.357,"GIRL: We've never had a problem with Hugo, ever."
00:30:58.357,00:31:01.527,Is that Uncle Hank?
00:31:01.527,00:31:05.238,"Right, what do you got there?"
00:31:05.238,00:31:08.492,Uncle Hank's arresting Mr. Archilleya.
00:31:08.492,00:31:10.536,CARMEN: This doesn't make any sense at all.
00:31:10.536,00:31:11.745,I don't understand.
00:31:11.745,00:31:15.624,HANK: I got two words for you: background check.
00:31:16.750,00:31:18.377,"Yo, yo, yo."
00:31:18.377,00:31:20.879,"1-4-8, 3-to-the-3, to-the-6, to-the-9."
00:31:20.879,00:31:23.923,Representing the ABQ.
00:31:23.923,00:31:25.217,Leave it at the tone.
00:31:26.510,00:31:29.805,Where the hell are you?
00:31:29.805,00:31:31.139,"MARIE: Hey, Walt?"
00:31:31.139,00:31:32.432,Yeah?
00:31:32.432,00:31:34.476,"Uh, Hank's about to deal."
00:31:34.476,00:31:37.229,"Okay, I'll, uh-- I'll be right there."
00:31:43.402,00:31:46.739,"HANK: All right, let's see what the turn brings us."
00:31:46.739,00:31:50.992,"You're looking good, Walt."
00:31:50.992,00:31:52.994,Yeah? Thanks.
00:31:52.994,00:31:56.331,SKYLER: He's actually on the pretty strong stuff now.
00:31:56.331,00:32:05.758,"Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into taking some time off from work, but-- Well, actually, I just talked to Carmen this morning and they're getting a substitute for a few weeks."
00:32:05.758,00:32:07.175,Oh.
00:32:07.175,00:32:08.761,I didn't have a chance to tell you.
00:32:08.761,00:32:09.969,Sorry.
00:32:09.969,00:32:11.221,"Your bet, tough guy."
00:32:11.221,00:32:12.514,Check.
00:32:12.514,00:32:15.016,"Uh, yeah, check."
00:32:15.016,00:32:18.144,Check's in the mail.
00:32:18.144,00:32:19.688,Ten million.
00:32:19.688,00:32:21.314,"That's 25 million, blue's 10."
00:32:21.314,00:32:23.942,"Well, then, 25 million, because that's how I roll."
00:32:23.942,00:32:30.156,"WALT JR.: Hey, Uncle Hank, I heard you arrested Mr. Archilleya the other day."
00:32:30.156,00:32:31.867,He's a pretty cool guy.
00:32:31.867,00:32:34.828,"Well, turns out he has a record."
00:32:34.828,00:32:37.497,"Yeah, a couple of possession beefs."
00:32:37.497,00:32:41.209,We figured he was the guy that was stealing your-- Your school's chemistry gear.
00:32:41.209,00:32:45.547,"I mean, you know, he had a key, fit the profile."
00:32:45.547,00:32:49.134,"And when we searched his truck, we found a big old fat blunt."
00:32:49.134,00:32:52.596,Which goes to prove old huge Hugo ain't so cool after all.
00:32:52.596,00:32:53.972,"It's-- It's to you, Walt."
00:32:53.972,00:32:57.392,"Yeah, I'll call."
00:32:57.392,00:33:00.938,"You know, I can't believe the school system didn't know about this guy's record."
00:33:00.938,00:33:03.064,"I mean, that's pretty scary."
00:33:03.064,00:33:06.526,How could something like that slip through the cracks?
00:33:06.526,00:33:11.490,"I mean, for what it's worth, Hugo just doesn't strike me as a thief."
00:33:11.490,00:33:17.537,"Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt, but you wouldn't know a criminal if he was close enough to check you for a hernia."
00:33:18.831,00:33:24.711,"That said, we got a search warrant, and we tore old Hugo's house apart."
00:33:24.711,00:33:30.175,"Turns out he's a major-league pothead, but, uh-- But he didn't raid your chemistry set."
00:33:30.175,00:33:31.844,You hiding something?
00:33:38.517,00:33:39.768,I'm in.
00:33:39.768,00:33:41.311,And the river card.
00:33:44.564,00:33:46.775,"Yeah, I got nothing, I'm out."
00:33:46.775,00:33:48.735,I'm out.
00:33:51.571,00:33:53.323,Yowza.
00:33:53.323,00:33:57.452,"When old holes-in-her-purse bails, you know you're in deep."
00:33:57.452,00:34:00.038,"Looks like it's you and me, buddy."
00:34:00.038,00:34:03.542,What's gonna happen to him?
00:34:03.542,00:34:07.337,"Oh, well, I mean, he's gonna lose his job, like he should."
00:34:07.337,00:34:10.757,"Probably spend a couple months in county, because it's not his first rap."
00:34:12.843,00:34:14.678,I'm waiting.
00:34:16.388,00:34:19.265,You gonna man up or are you gonna puss out?
00:34:19.265,00:34:20.600,Hank.
00:34:21.977,00:34:23.269,Sorry.
00:34:26.899,00:34:28.901,WALT: I'm all in.
00:34:28.901,00:34:30.443,Mm.
00:34:32.362,00:34:38.117,"Dude. You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar."
00:34:39.536,00:34:40.954,"What are you smoking there, huh?"
00:34:42.706,00:34:44.791,You got a heart?
00:34:49.588,00:34:53.132,"Nope. Not falling for it, buddy."
00:34:55.010,00:34:57.095,Talk about anti-climactic.
00:34:57.095,00:34:59.639,"Your cards couldn't have been that bad, come on."
00:34:59.639,00:35:02.601,"Oh, my God."
00:35:02.601,00:35:05.103,HANK: What are you doing?
00:35:08.690,00:35:11.109,Oh.
00:35:11.109,00:35:13.445,A handful of nothing.
00:36:10.502,00:36:12.170,"Yeah, what up?"
00:36:13.922,00:36:17.342,Who is this?
00:36:17.342,00:36:20.887,"Hey, man, he's out."
00:36:20.887,00:36:23.056,"Well, where is he, then?"
00:36:37.195,00:36:38.780,You the guy?
00:36:38.780,00:36:40.866,"Yeah, I'm the guy."
00:36:46.705,00:36:49.166,How is he?
00:36:49.166,00:36:53.045,Got some busted ribs and like that.
00:36:53.045,00:36:54.713,Got messed up pretty good.
00:36:54.713,00:36:58.884,"I was all, like, Damn, Tuco, chill, ese."
00:37:00.259,00:37:03.013,I don't know what got into him.
00:37:05.807,00:37:08.060,"He's out, man. Way out."
00:37:08.060,00:37:11.396,They got him doped up big time.
00:37:17.152,00:37:18.778,"So you're the cook, huh?"
00:37:20.989,00:37:22.866,"Yo, I didn't catch your name."
00:37:37.130,00:37:40.383,Tell me about this Tuco.
00:37:40.383,00:37:42.010,Tell me everything about him.
00:39:24.570,00:39:25.905,Morning.
00:39:28.283,00:39:30.910,"Could you pass the butter, please?"
00:39:33.496,00:39:35.123,"Badass, Dad."
00:40:22.003,00:40:25.423,"MAN: Hey, cue ball. Need directions?"
00:40:28.218,00:40:29.552,You Tuco?
00:40:34.891,00:40:38.477,"I want to talk to Tuco, and I'm not leaving until I do."
00:42:03.438,00:42:04.814,What's your name?
00:42:04.814,00:42:07.650,Heisenberg.
00:42:07.650,00:42:11.654,Heisenberg. Okay.
00:42:11.654,00:42:13.281,"Have a seat, Heisenberg."
00:42:14.699,00:42:17.285,I don't imagine I'll be here very long.
00:42:17.285,00:42:18.536,No?
00:42:19.787,00:42:21.331,All right.
00:42:22.623,00:42:23.958,Be that way.
00:42:26.752,00:42:28.463,It's your meeting.
00:42:28.463,00:42:31.841,Why don't you start talking and tell me what you want?
00:42:32.842,00:42:34.760,Fifty thousand dollars.
00:42:36.554,00:42:40.766,"Oh, man."
00:42:40.766,00:42:46.481,Thirty-five for the pound of meth you stole and another 15 for my partner's pain and suffering.
00:42:52.237,00:42:54.113,Partner.
00:43:00.995,00:43:04.499,"Oh, yeah, I remember that little bitch."
00:43:04.499,00:43:06.792,So you must be daddy.
00:43:15.134,00:43:16.677,Let me get this straight.
00:43:19.013,00:43:21.015,I steal your dope.
00:43:21.015,00:43:22.392,Hm?
00:43:22.392,00:43:30.233,"I beat the piss out of your mule boy, and then you walk in here and you bring me more meth?"
00:43:33.652,00:43:34.904,Whoo!
00:43:34.904,00:43:36.948,"That's a brilliant plan, ese."
00:43:36.948,00:43:39.451,Brilliant.
00:43:39.451,00:43:42.036,You got one part of that wrong.
00:43:46.040,00:43:49.502,This is not meth.
00:44:16.571,00:44:18.364,Are you fucking nuts?
00:44:18.364,00:44:19.991,You wanna find out?
00:44:21.075,00:44:24.579,"No, no, Gonzo, calma. Calma."
00:44:24.579,00:44:27.123,Calma.
00:44:27.123,00:44:31.628,"You got balls, I'll give you that."
00:44:31.628,00:44:34.713,"All right, all right."
00:44:39.302,00:44:49.562,"That crystal that your partner brought me, it sold faster than 10-dollar ass in TJ."
00:44:52.857,00:44:56.819,Let's say you bring me another pound next week.
00:45:00.156,00:45:01.616,Money up front.
00:45:01.616,00:45:04.619,All right.
00:45:04.619,00:45:05.995,Money up front.
00:45:11.750,00:45:13.836,Sometimes you gotta rob to keep your riches.
00:45:15.796,00:45:18.757,Just as long as we got an understanding.
00:45:21.093,00:45:24.889,One pound is not gonna cut it.
00:45:32.146,00:45:33.439,"Oh, really?"
00:45:34.773,00:45:36.359,Hey.
00:45:36.359,00:45:37.694,What is that shit?
00:45:39.612,00:45:44.741,Fulminated mercury and a little tweak of chemistry.
00:00:02.377,00:00:08.550,"In closing, I can tell you we take this very seriously."
00:00:08.550,00:00:13.012,Stopping the manufacture and sale of methamphetamines remains one of our highest priorities.
00:00:13.012,00:00:17.184,The theft of lab equipment from your school is also receiving our highest attention.
00:00:17.184,00:00:23.524,"Rest assured, no stone will go unturned in our search for the person or persons responsible for this."
00:00:23.524,00:00:26.485,"If you have any questions, now would be the time. Sir."
00:00:26.485,00:00:29.947,MAN: You're talking like you haven't caught anybody yet.
00:00:29.947,00:00:32.366,What about the janitor dealing drugs at school?
00:00:32.366,00:00:36.161,There is no indication that this individual was selling drugs.
00:00:36.161,00:00:41.750,"He was arrested for having a small amount of marijuana in his car, not in the school."
00:00:41.750,00:00:43.502,And he's since been fired.
00:00:43.502,00:00:45.462,MAN: I heard he had a record.
00:00:45.462,00:00:47.756,I'd like to know how he got a job here in the first place.
00:00:47.756,00:00:49.884,Exactly. Why wasn't there a background check?
00:00:49.884,00:00:54.179,WOMAN: There was one. We're currently reviewing our hiring policies.
00:00:54.179,00:00:55.806,WOMAN 2: You better be doing more.
00:00:55.806,00:00:58.017,This guy was arrested right in front of my daughter.
00:00:58.017,00:01:00.101,"MAN: This guy was stealing lab equipment, right?"
00:01:00.101,00:01:02.354,MAN 2: That's not our thinking at this time.
00:01:02.354,00:01:05.858,"We're looking at others who had access, but not limited to the maintenance staff."
00:01:05.858,00:01:07.818,WOMAN 2: Are you saying there was a break-in?
00:01:07.818,00:01:09.277,Do we know when this happened?
00:01:09.277,00:01:11.321,"I mean, could it have been during school hours?"
00:01:11.321,00:01:13.615,We haven't been able to establish a date or time.
00:01:13.615,00:01:16.869,But there is no sign of breaking or entering.
00:01:16.869,00:01:19.496,MAN: So whoever took it had a key.
00:01:19.496,00:01:21.122,We're talking inside job?
00:01:21.122,00:01:23.124,Someone who's still at the school?
00:01:23.124,00:01:29.840,"MAN 2: Sir, at this time I'm not able to discuss details with you, but what I can tell you is that we have good people working very hard on this case."
00:01:29.840,00:01:32.843,"MAN: I'm sorry, officer, but that just sounds like double talk."
00:01:32.843,00:01:35.804,WOMAN: We're trying to protect our children. Level with us.
00:01:35.804,00:01:39.058,"WOMAN 2: Really, we're giving you all the information we have."
00:01:39.058,00:01:42.185,MAN: You know what I'd like to see in school? Drug-sniffing dogs.
00:01:42.185,00:01:46.314,WOMAN: Yeah. Dogs and metal detectors and locker searches and strip-searches.
00:01:46.314,00:01:56.909,"WOMAN 2: Our district has strict policies-- WOMAN: I heard about this school in Canada, they arrested one of the groundskeepers with drugs, and the next day they found out over half the students were high on LSD."
00:01:56.909,00:01:59.703,WOMAN 3: LSD? When were you gonna tell us about the LSD?
00:01:59.703,00:02:04.666,"No, please."
00:02:07.836,00:02:10.005,MAN: What about the equipment that's stolen?
00:02:10.005,00:02:13.634,WOMAN 2: The equipment was taken from our chemistry-department locker.
00:02:13.634,00:02:18.388,And tonight we're lucky to have someone here to give us some specifics.
00:02:18.388,00:02:20.057,Walt?
00:02:21.642,00:02:22.977,Yeah.
00:02:22.977,00:02:27.314,Mr. White is currently on medical leave.
00:02:27.314,00:02:32.987,"But as he's chair of the science department, he's made a very special effort to be with us here."
00:02:32.987,00:02:37.157,And I'd like to take a moment to thank him for that.
00:02:44.581,00:02:49.128,Could you please tell us more about the equipment that was taken?
00:02:49.128,00:02:51.672,Please.
00:02:51.672,00:02:53.381,Sorry.
00:02:54.382,00:02:56.343,And thank you.
00:03:00.639,00:03:09.272,The inventory list for the missing labware is as follows: One 5000 milliliter round-bottom boiling flask.
00:03:09.272,00:03:14.111,"One Kjeldahl-style recovery flask, 800 milliliters."
00:03:14.111,00:03:17.031,Two full-face respirators.
00:03:17.031,00:03:21.242,"Some CEP funnels, some head with a thermometer holder."
00:03:27.958,00:03:29.250,Ooh. Ow.
00:03:29.250,00:03:30.669,Okay.
00:03:33.338,00:03:40.179,Where did that come from?
00:03:41.388,00:03:43.974,Because it was illegal.
00:04:22.221,00:04:25.224,The basement.
00:04:25.224,00:04:27.059,But just look at all this space.
00:04:27.059,00:04:30.229,"You gotta think rec room, media room."
00:04:30.229,00:04:33.523,Just imagine all the things you could do down here.
00:04:33.523,00:04:37.444,"Now remember, you're buying for this fantastic neighborhood."
00:04:37.444,00:04:41.990,"Big lawns and shade trees, walking distance to the country club."
00:04:48.789,00:04:50.999,What happened there?
00:04:50.999,00:04:55.462,"Bit of a fixer, but this house has great bones."
00:05:00.175,00:05:01.969,WOMAN: Know what? We're zeroing in.
00:05:01.969,00:05:04.304,"I've got another listing, brand new, around the corner."
00:05:04.304,00:05:05.555,Yeah?
00:05:05.555,00:05:08.475,Hi.
00:05:08.475,00:05:10.644,It's by appointment only.
00:05:10.644,00:05:13.021,"Oh, well, I'm here to see the owner."
00:05:13.021,00:05:14.355,Oh.
00:05:14.355,00:05:19.611,"He's in the, uh, recreational vehicle."
00:05:24.324,00:05:26.910,"Yo, it's appointment only."
00:05:39.714,00:05:41.883,How are you feeling?
00:05:44.136,00:05:51.018,About as good as you look.
00:05:51.018,00:05:54.353,"Listen, I visited you in the hospital, but you were asleep."
00:05:54.353,00:05:56.940,"Yeah, Skinny Pete said you wanted Tuco's address."
00:05:56.940,00:06:00.610,Acting like you're all out for blood.
00:06:00.610,00:06:04.323,But you are alive.
00:06:04.323,00:06:07.034,"No, I did go see him."
00:06:07.034,00:06:08.660,"So, what, are you selling your house?"
00:06:08.660,00:06:13.748,I got two dudes that turned into raspberry slushy and flushed down my toilet.
00:06:13.748,00:06:16.375,I can't even take a proper dump in there.
00:06:16.375,00:06:20.588,"I mean, the whole damn house has gotta be haunted by now."
00:06:20.588,00:06:23.508,You didn't actually go see Tuco.
00:06:24.509,00:06:26.094,Here.
00:06:28.555,00:06:33.143,"That is 17,500."
00:06:33.143,00:06:34.978,"Plus, there's an extra 15 in there."
00:06:34.978,00:06:37.814,It's all yours.
00:06:37.814,00:06:40.567,You got this money from Tuco?
00:06:40.567,00:06:43.402,"So Tuco gave you this, is what you're saying."
00:06:43.402,00:06:44.821,"Well, we made a deal."
00:06:44.821,00:06:47.490,You made a deal?
00:06:47.490,00:06:51.786,How--? Why would you make a deal with that scumbag?
00:06:51.786,00:06:54.206,You see what he did to me?
00:06:51.786,00:06:55.832,Because I think that we can do business together.
00:06:55.832,00:06:58.085,We came to an understanding.
00:06:58.085,00:07:00.545,"No way, man."
00:07:00.545,00:07:02.672,Take a look at the money in your hand.
00:07:02.672,00:07:06.593,"Now, just imagine making that every week."
00:07:06.593,00:07:11.390,"That's right. Two pounds a week, 35,000 a pound."
00:07:11.390,00:07:23.277,"Without even talking to me you told this insane ass-clown, dead-eyed killer that, uh-- That we would give him 2 pounds a week."
00:07:23.277,00:07:26.196,"We'll just scale up our operation, add a few more hours."
00:07:26.196,00:07:27.822,"No, don't talk to me about hours."
00:07:27.822,00:07:31.368,"What about pseudo, man?"
00:07:31.368,00:07:35.330,You think the meth fairy's just gonna bring it to us?
00:07:35.330,00:07:37.999,"God, it takes me a week to get this stuff."
00:07:37.999,00:07:43.504,"I'm driving all the way to Las Cruces, 200 miles each way to meet up with my smurfs."
00:07:43.504,00:07:44.714,Smurfs?
00:07:44.714,00:07:49.719,The dudes who go to the drugstores and get a couple boxes at a time and then sell them to me.
00:07:49.719,00:07:52.806,"That's maybe only good for, like, maybe a half-pound worth."
00:07:52.806,00:07:56.393,"See, that's the bottleneck in your brilliant business plan."
00:07:56.393,00:07:58.270,All right.
00:07:56.393,00:08:01.106,"Of course, you would've known that if you would've just asked me."
00:08:03.400,00:08:05.277,"MAN: Well, here we are again."
00:08:05.277,00:08:07.404,Here we are.
00:08:07.404,00:08:08.989,"Skyler, you look great."
00:08:08.989,00:08:11.783,"You must be, what, six, seven months?"
00:08:11.783,00:08:15.245,How goes it?
00:08:15.245,00:08:19.499,Other than waddling to the bathroom every five minutes.
00:08:19.499,00:08:21.501,The baby shower is next week.
00:08:21.501,00:08:23.670,And it'll be good to...
00:08:23.670,00:08:27.548,It'll be good to have a day that's just about Skyler.
00:08:27.548,00:08:29.592,Very nice.
00:08:29.592,00:08:31.886,Thank you.
00:08:31.886,00:08:34.097,"Walt, I see you committed to the hair loss."
00:08:34.097,00:08:36.057,Mm. Yeah.
00:08:36.057,00:08:38.601,How do you feel?
00:08:38.601,00:08:42.189,"I-- You know, pretty decent, actually."
00:08:42.189,00:08:45.566,His color is better.
00:08:45.566,00:08:50.280,"And, uh, he's even more, um, physical."
00:08:50.280,00:08:52.573,More physical?
00:08:50.280,00:08:55.243,"Uh, well, sexual."
00:08:56.911,00:08:58.288,"Frisky, actually."
00:08:59.747,00:09:01.500,"I mean, that's gotta be a good sign, right?"
00:09:01.500,00:09:03.751,"Sure, I'll take that."
00:09:03.751,00:09:05.253,Right.
00:09:05.253,00:09:07.464,Couldn't that mean that the chemo is working?
00:09:07.464,00:09:11.759,"Well, realistically, it may just mean that we've got the antiemetics tuned right."
00:09:11.759,00:09:18.266,"Truth is, until Walt's finished this round of chemo, and we look at a new PET scan, we just can't say for sure."
00:09:18.266,00:09:20.435,"Well, isn't there anything else we could be doing?"
00:09:20.435,00:09:24.439,I've been wondering about alternative medicine.
00:09:24.439,00:09:27.859,"I mean, Eastern healing."
00:09:27.859,00:09:30.028,"You know, holistic."
00:09:30.028,00:09:42.416,"Well, I can't speak to its efficacy, but as long as it doesn't interfere with our treatment, anything that helps my patient have a better outlook, a better comfort, is fine by me."
00:09:42.416,00:09:46.878,So you're saying it's just all psychological.
00:09:46.878,00:09:49.381,It doesn't make any real difference.
00:09:49.381,00:09:53.218,Having a better outlook can make a tremendous difference.
00:09:53.218,00:09:57.638,But it's also important that we manage our expectations.
00:10:17.534,00:10:19.286,What?
00:10:23.457,00:10:26.293,A junkyard?
00:10:26.293,00:10:29.170,You picked this place?
00:10:29.170,00:10:32.340,What's wrong with it?
00:10:32.340,00:10:36.970,This is like a non-criminal's idea of a drug meet.
00:10:36.970,00:10:39.806,"This is, Oh, I saw this in a movie. Ooh. Look at me."
00:10:39.806,00:10:43.851,Yes. So where do you transact your business? Enlighten me.
00:10:43.851,00:10:46.771,"I don't know, how about Taco Cabeza?"
00:10:46.771,00:10:49.983,Half the deals I've ever done went down at Taco Cabeza.
00:10:49.983,00:10:51.526,Nice and public.
00:10:51.526,00:10:54.488,Open 24 hours.
00:10:54.488,00:10:58.199,Nobody ever gets shot at Taco Cabeza.
00:10:58.199,00:11:01.369,"Hell, why not the mall?"
00:11:01.369,00:11:04.914,"You know, wait at the Gap."
00:11:04.914,00:11:10.295,"You know, I'll put down the flat-front khakis, head on over, grab an Orange Julius."
00:11:10.295,00:11:17.260,"Skip the part where psycho-lunatic Tuco, you know, comes and steals my drugs and leaves me bleeding to death."
00:11:27.061,00:11:30.148,"Look, you don't have to be here for this."
00:11:30.148,00:11:32.025,"Okay? I mean, seriously."
00:11:32.025,00:11:33.360,I'm okay.
00:11:36.279,00:11:39.533,No. I'm no pussy.
00:11:39.533,00:11:40.783,I'm good.
00:11:58.677,00:12:00.845,Mr. Clean and his boy.
00:12:03.056,00:12:04.849,"Now, I'm sorry that I had to tune you up."
00:12:04.849,00:12:07.060,"Respect, ése, you gotta give it to get it."
00:12:11.814,00:12:14.317,"Hey, what are we doing way the hell out here?"
00:12:14.317,00:12:16.194,"What, they close the mall or something?"
00:12:18.613,00:12:20.490,"Heisenberg, come on, break it out."
00:12:24.536,00:12:27.288,That's it? That's all you got?
00:12:27.288,00:12:28.789,We had some production problems.
00:12:28.789,00:12:30.667,0.53.
00:12:32.751,00:12:34.462,I thought you was a player.
00:12:34.462,00:12:39.967,"You told me 2 pounds, and now you waste my time with these Chiclets?"
00:12:51.020,00:12:52.897,Seventeen and a half.
00:12:52.897,00:12:56.484,Minus the half for wasting my time.
00:12:56.484,00:12:59.028,"WALT: Hey, come on."
00:12:59.028,00:13:00.739,You got something to say?
00:13:02.990,00:13:07.912,You're doing business like a couple little bitches.
00:13:07.912,00:13:09.664,I want all of it.
00:13:12.833,00:13:14.210,Seventy grand.
00:13:14.210,00:13:15.629,What did you say?
00:13:15.629,00:13:17.547,WALT: You like this product.
00:13:17.547,00:13:19.507,And you want more.
00:13:19.507,00:13:21.551,Consider it a capital investment.
00:13:24.929,00:13:27.890,"Look, old bald motherfucker."
00:13:31.561,00:13:34.355,"Fifty-two and a half, 25 points vig."
00:13:34.355,00:13:35.982,Vig?
00:13:37.692,00:13:40.236,"Interest, weekly."
00:13:42.656,00:13:44.699,Okay.
00:13:44.699,00:13:50.871,"That's $65,625 with interest."
00:13:50.871,00:13:53.166,1.875 pounds.
00:13:53.166,00:13:55.168,"TUCO: No, 2 pounds."
00:13:55.168,00:13:58.921,"Next Friday, and no production problems."
00:14:00.465,00:14:02.592,Can you handle 4 pounds?
00:14:06.680,00:14:10.099,"Listen, old man, talk is talk."
00:14:10.099,00:14:14.395,"But owing me money, that's bad."
00:14:35.916,00:14:40.714,What did you just do?
00:14:43.049,00:14:48.471,Four pounds. Four pounds.
00:14:48.471,00:14:52.559,"We're talking 2, 300 boxes of sinus pills."
00:14:52.559,00:14:54.728,There ain't that many smurfs in the world.
00:14:54.728,00:14:56.896,We're not gonna need pseudoephedrine.
00:14:56.896,00:14:59.940,We're gonna make phenylacetone in a tube furnace.
00:14:59.940,00:15:04.278,"We're gonna use reductive amination to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds."
00:15:04.278,00:15:07.073,So no pseudo?
00:15:07.073,00:15:09.033,So you do have a plan.
00:15:09.033,00:15:11.536,"Yeah, Mr. White."
00:15:11.536,00:15:13.287,"Yeah, science."
00:15:13.287,00:15:15.248,Okay.
00:15:18.710,00:15:22.547,What's this?
00:15:22.547,00:15:26.175,Getting some of those items may be challenging.
00:15:26.175,00:15:34.434,"One autotransformer, 6 liters anhydrous methenamine."
00:15:34.434,00:15:37.437,Two 35 M and M tube furnaces.
00:15:37.437,00:15:39.272,"It's mm, millimeter."
00:15:39.272,00:15:42.024,"One 70 millimeter would be fine, but they're hard to come by."
00:15:42.024,00:15:44.360,Forty grams thorium nitrate.
00:15:44.360,00:15:47.614,"Yo, Mr. White, I can't even pronounce half this shit."
00:15:47.614,00:15:49.407,No. Count me out. All right?
00:15:49.407,00:15:51.743,"I'm leaving town. I'm moving to, like, Oregon or something."
00:15:51.743,00:15:53.286,"This is just-- Jesse, Jesse, Jesse."
00:15:53.286,00:15:54.788,Listen to me.
00:15:54.788,00:15:59.166,Today is the first day of the rest of your life.
00:15:59.166,00:16:01.335,What are you doing?
00:16:01.335,00:16:03.254,The first day of the rest of your life.
00:16:03.254,00:16:05.172,But what kind of life will it be? Huh?
00:16:05.172,00:16:09.051,"Will it be a life of fear, of Oh, no, no, no."
00:16:09.051,00:16:12.388,Of never once believing in yourself?
00:16:12.388,00:16:13.556,Hm?
00:16:13.556,00:16:15.725,I don't know.
00:16:15.725,00:16:19.061,These things?
00:16:19.061,00:16:22.148,And only you can get them for us.
00:16:27.654,00:16:32.032,"WALT JR.: Okay, it's ready. Here you go."
00:16:32.032,00:16:36.913,"Hi, baby."
00:16:36.913,00:16:43.544,"Of course you already know that because when you watch this, 20 years from now, I will look exactly the same as I do now."
00:16:43.544,00:16:45.212,"I know, it is amazing."
00:16:45.212,00:16:49.216,I have aged shockingly well.
00:16:49.216,00:16:54.848,"Anyway, welcome to your baby shower, Esmeralda."
00:16:54.848,00:16:57.809,Esmeralda?
00:16:57.809,00:17:00.227,That's your name and you heard it here first.
00:17:00.227,00:17:04.858,"Now, that is your wonderful, handsome older brother."
00:17:04.858,00:17:06.651,"Show her, older brother, your face."
00:17:08.862,00:17:10.530,"Okay, not right up the nose."
00:17:08.862,00:17:13.324,"Don't-- Okay, not up it."
00:17:13.324,00:17:18.329,Here's your mommy.
00:17:18.329,00:17:21.791,"And look, there you are, Esmeralda."
00:17:21.791,00:17:24.961,"Wake up, baby."
00:17:24.961,00:17:33.845,"Easy, easy. Believe it or not, Esmeralda, right after the party, your name was changed to Holly."
00:17:33.845,00:17:38.474,"And I believe, Hank, that was around the time that we took Aunt Marie to the insane asylum."
00:17:38.474,00:17:40.977,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:40.977,00:17:43.980,Then I married Shania Twain and lived happily ever after.
00:17:46.190,00:17:51.905,"There's Daddy. Speak, Daddy."
00:17:53.322,00:17:55.115,"Oh, uh..."
00:17:58.369,00:18:01.497,"Holly, I am very proud of you."
00:18:01.497,00:18:04.834,And I...
00:18:04.834,00:18:06.711,ALL: Aww.
00:18:08.796,00:18:20.099,"Wherever you go, whatever you do in life, always know that you have a family who loves you very, very much."
00:18:23.895,00:18:26.522,Cheers.
00:18:26.522,00:18:31.444,"SKYLER: Oh, my God, it's so cute."
00:18:26.522,00:18:34.989,"Oh, Carmen. It's-- Oh, look. Look at that."
00:18:34.989,00:18:37.116,"I love it, Carmen. Thank you."
00:18:37.116,00:18:38.534,"You're so welcome, honey."
00:18:38.534,00:18:41.328,SKYLER: Thank you.
00:18:44.373,00:18:48.252,Okay.
00:18:48.252,00:18:50.964,"Oh, what nice wrapping paper."
00:18:50.964,00:18:53.257,Marie always finds the best wrapping paper.
00:18:53.257,00:18:55.384,I do.
00:18:55.384,00:18:59.513,Let's see. And...
00:18:59.513,00:19:01.015,Exciting.
00:19:01.975,00:19:05.561,"Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy."
00:19:09.732,00:19:13.861,It's-- It's a-- A tiara.
00:19:13.861,00:19:15.488,Yes.
00:19:17.824,00:19:20.200,"Marie, is this--?"
00:19:20.200,00:19:24.204,White gold and several carats worth of zircons.
00:19:24.204,00:19:26.874,"Oh, Marie."
00:19:26.874,00:19:30.294,You shouldn't have.
00:19:30.294,00:19:34.507,But it's so-- It's really-- It's...
00:19:34.507,00:19:35.842,It's sparkly.
00:19:37.176,00:19:39.053,Sparkly.
00:19:39.053,00:19:41.973,SKYLER: Thank you.
00:19:41.973,00:19:44.100,You got anything stronger than beer?
00:19:44.100,00:19:47.061,SKYLER: It's great. I love it.
00:19:47.061,00:19:51.649,SKYLER: Thank you.
00:19:51.649,00:19:56.570,"HANK: Sorry, man. It's just, you know, after 200 presents, it just gets kind of old."
00:19:59.824,00:20:02.660,It's nice stuff.
00:20:05.245,00:20:08.248,I got just the thing to go with that.
00:20:13.129,00:20:15.048,"I'm sorry, man, I wasn't thinking."
00:20:15.048,00:20:18.217,"No, no, no. It's okay."
00:20:18.217,00:20:19.969,You mind if I have one?
00:20:19.969,00:20:22.513,You think that's a good idea?
00:20:22.513,00:20:26.308,"Hank, I've already got lung cancer."
00:20:26.308,00:20:29.062,Okay.
00:20:31.480,00:20:33.191,Thanks.
00:20:35.693,00:20:37.695,Cuban.
00:20:37.695,00:20:39.197,Hm.
00:20:41.074,00:20:43.868,I did a little favor for an FBI guy.
00:20:46.412,00:20:52.210,"Now, I was under the impression that these were illegal."
00:20:54.170,00:20:59.425,"Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?"
00:21:04.430,00:21:08.684,"It's funny, isn't it?"
00:21:08.684,00:21:10.477,Yeah.
00:21:10.477,00:21:13.689,What line is that?
00:21:13.689,00:21:17.151,"Well, what's legal, what's illegal."
00:21:17.151,00:21:20.529,"You know, Cuban cigars, alcohol."
00:21:20.529,00:21:26.535,"You know, if we were drinking this in 1930, we'd be breaking the law."
00:21:26.535,00:21:29.830,"Another year, we'd be okay."
00:21:31.249,00:21:34.001,Who knows what will be legal next year.
00:21:35.502,00:21:37.296,You mean like pot?
00:21:39.715,00:21:42.176,Yeah. Like pot.
00:21:42.176,00:21:46.680,Or whatever.
00:21:46.680,00:21:51.393,Cocaine? Heroin?
00:21:51.393,00:21:54.063,I'm just saying it's arbitrary.
00:21:55.189,00:21:56.899,"Well, you ought to visit lockup."
00:21:56.899,00:21:59.693,You hear a lot of guys talking like that.
00:21:59.693,00:22:03.447,"Hey, man, what you busting me with these 14 bales of ganja?"
00:22:03.447,00:22:08.410,It's all gonna be legal next year when Willie Nelson's president.
00:22:08.410,00:22:10.037,"Say it, buddy."
00:22:10.037,00:22:12.248,It don't only go one way either.
00:22:12.248,00:22:15.751,Sometimes there's stuff that's legal that shouldn't be.
00:22:15.751,00:22:20.214,"I mean, frigging meth used to be legal."
00:22:20.214,00:22:24.718,Used to sell it over every counter at every pharmacy across America.
00:22:24.718,00:22:27.138,"Thank God they came to their senses on that one, huh?"
00:22:30.390,00:22:32.476,Yeah.
00:22:37.564,00:22:39.650,WALT: Okay.
00:22:45.198,00:22:46.532,Nice party.
00:22:46.532,00:22:47.908,Mm.
00:22:50.536,00:22:53.080,A tiara.
00:22:53.080,00:22:57.918,A white-gold tiara for a newborn baby.
00:22:57.918,00:23:03.341,"Yeah. You know, I think she got that at Gertrude Zachary's in Knob Hill."
00:23:03.341,00:23:08.637,"I mean, that thing must've cost, like, what, 5 or 600 dollars."
00:23:12.099,00:23:14.935,"You know, I think I'm gonna return it."
00:23:14.935,00:23:17.730,Are you sure?
00:23:17.730,00:23:25.779,"Well, maybe I can explain to her that we need a Diaper Genie more than a white-gold baby tiara."
00:23:29.242,00:23:34.914,"Hey. You know, I've been thinking about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli about alternative medicine."
00:23:34.914,00:23:37.291,No. Don't worry. I'm not gonna mention that anymore.
00:23:37.291,00:23:41.295,"No, no, no. What I mean is that maybe there is something to it."
00:23:42.963,00:23:49.720,Look. They do this Navajo sweat lodge up by Farmington.
00:23:49.720,00:23:53.766,Healing ceremony. It's supposed to be good for your lungs.
00:23:53.766,00:24:01.690,"I'm not saying that I believe in it, but it might be an experience."
00:24:01.690,00:24:04.026,Really.
00:24:04.026,00:24:05.403,You?
00:24:05.403,00:24:08.072,In a sweat lodge.
00:24:08.072,00:24:11.658,"I was thinking about driving up on Friday, coming back Sunday."
00:24:11.658,00:24:13.160,"I mean, if you're okay with it."
00:24:13.160,00:24:15.537,"Well, of course I'm okay with that."
00:24:15.537,00:24:16.872,Okay.
00:24:26.506,00:24:28.508,Sweat lodge?
00:24:28.508,00:24:30.510,I'm already sweating.
00:24:32.846,00:24:34.223,Okay.
00:24:34.223,00:24:36.142,Hey.
00:24:38.352,00:24:40.354,70 millimeter tube furnace.
00:24:40.354,00:24:42.898,This is excellent. Good work.
00:24:42.898,00:24:45.901,"Okay, hydrogen."
00:24:45.901,00:24:48.028,"Yeah, like you asked."
00:24:45.901,00:24:51.740,"I mean, this-- This crap wasn't easy to get."
00:24:51.740,00:24:53.784,Methylamine.
00:24:53.784,00:24:55.619,I don't see the methylamine.
00:24:55.619,00:24:59.623,"Yeah, well, that's where I ran into some trouble."
00:24:59.623,00:25:01.292,What kind of trouble?
00:25:01.292,00:25:03.710,"Well, half this crap I could just buy, right?"
00:25:03.710,00:25:07.214,But this methylamine...
00:25:07.214,00:25:10.592,"Not so easy. I mean, they got it locked down tight."
00:25:10.592,00:25:14.013,But I did find some pros who will rip it off for us.
00:25:14.013,00:25:17.016,But they want 10 grand.
00:25:17.016,00:25:19.018,"So, what's the problem?"
00:25:19.018,00:25:21.770,"No, had."
00:25:21.770,00:25:23.189,"I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left."
00:25:23.189,00:25:26.233,"I told you, all this crap was expensive."
00:25:26.233,00:25:30.321,"So these thieves, did they say where they would be stealing it from?"
00:25:30.321,00:25:33.282,"A chemical supply place, south of town."
00:25:33.282,00:25:37.577,They got guards and security cameras. They got steel doors.
00:25:37.577,00:25:40.914,That's why these dudes are charging so much.
00:25:40.914,00:25:42.082,What?
00:25:50.383,00:25:51.633,Hm.
00:25:56.263,00:25:59.641,So why don't we just steal it ourselves?
00:26:01.852,00:26:03.521,Yeah?
00:26:03.521,00:26:06.440,How we gonna do that?
00:26:06.440,00:26:07.774,With this.
00:26:22.039,00:26:24.458,"So, what's this stuff called again?"
00:26:27.585,00:26:29.213,Thermite.
00:26:29.213,00:26:31.589,And that will cut through a lock?
00:26:31.589,00:26:34.592,Because this is supposed to be one big-ass lock.
00:26:34.592,00:26:41.475,"In World War II, the Germans had an artillery piece-- It's the biggest in the world."
00:26:41.475,00:26:43.601,--called the Gustav Gun.
00:26:43.601,00:26:46.272,And it weighed a thousand tons.
00:26:46.272,00:26:56.365,"And the Gustav was capable of firing a 7-ton shell and hitting a target, accurately, 23 miles away."
00:26:56.365,00:27:03.830,"I mean, you could drop bombs on it every day for a month, without ever disabling it."
00:27:03.830,00:27:05.374,But...
00:27:05.374,00:27:18.678,"drop a commando, one man, with just a bag of this, and he could melt right through 4 inches of solid steel and destroy that gun forever."
00:27:22.433,00:27:23.725,Jeez.
00:27:27.146,00:27:34.487,"So yes, I think it will cut through any lock we're likely to find."
00:27:34.487,00:27:35.988,MAN: You'd like to return this.
00:27:35.988,00:27:39.408,"SKYLER: It's very nice, but yes."
00:27:39.408,00:27:41.785,"Well, it-- It is from the store, isn't it?"
00:27:41.785,00:27:44.746,"Oh, yes, it's from this store."
00:27:44.746,00:27:47.040,Do you happen to have a receipt?
00:27:47.040,00:27:49.667,"No, I don't. It was a gift."
00:27:49.667,00:27:51.629,A-ha. A gift.
00:27:51.629,00:27:54.131,"Mr. Wilson, could you step over here, please?"
00:27:55.633,00:28:00.179,"Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch this lady while I phone the police."
00:28:00.179,00:28:02.139,"Whoa, excuse me?"
00:28:02.139,00:28:05.851,"Ma'am, this item is stolen, as I'm sure you know."
00:28:05.851,00:28:07.603,"It-- Come with me, please."
00:28:10.772,00:28:15.569,"Oh, yes."
00:28:15.569,00:28:18.280,Please do.
00:28:18.280,00:28:20.907,We'll be here.
00:28:20.907,00:28:25.663,"Look, I-- I've never stolen anything in my life."
00:28:25.663,00:28:33.462,"All right? I told you, that tiara was a gift-- A baby-shower gift."
00:28:35.381,00:28:37.132,I don't think I have to tell you that.
00:28:37.132,00:28:38.967,"Ma'am, you don't have to tell me anything."
00:28:38.967,00:28:41.094,You can talk to the police.
00:28:41.094,00:28:50.187,"I can tell them my daughter-in-law remembers showing this particular item to a tall blond woman, who, when her back was turned, walked right out the door with it."
00:28:50.187,00:28:52.147,So there.
00:28:52.147,00:28:56.276,"Well, then, I can talk to the Channel Three News."
00:28:56.276,00:29:08.247,"Yeah, I can tell them how you people, without a shred-- Without a modicum of evidence, illegally detained an innocent pregnant woman in a dank storeroom."
00:29:08.247,00:29:12.209,This is my office.
00:29:12.209,00:29:16.129,"Furthermore, I'm not getting enough air back here."
00:29:16.129,00:29:18.965,I don't think-- I don't think I can breathe.
00:29:18.965,00:29:21.968,"Oh, my-- Oh, my God. Oh, no."
00:29:21.968,00:29:38.318,"I'm going into labor. Yes, I-- Hi, you've reached Marie."
00:29:38.318,00:29:41.905,"Marie, it's Skyler."
00:29:41.905,00:29:44.491,I need to talk to you immediately.
00:29:47.119,00:29:50.539,WALT: Where is the guard?
00:29:50.539,00:29:51.915,Do you think he already passed?
00:29:51.915,00:29:53.875,"JESSE: Look, I don't-- I don't know."
00:29:53.875,00:29:56.295,"Okay. Wait, there he is."
00:29:56.295,00:29:57.588,"Yeah, I see him."
00:29:57.588,00:29:58.922,Wait-- Wait till he passes.
00:29:58.922,00:30:00.215,"Okay, it's clear."
00:30:05.262,00:30:06.597,Here.
00:30:09.141,00:30:11.851,What the hell is this?
00:30:11.851,00:30:13.437,Then you go to another store.
00:30:13.437,00:30:15.147,"If this is all they had, you're in the wrong place."
00:30:15.147,00:30:16.482,Just put it on.
00:30:16.482,00:30:18.484,Should've-- Of course.
00:30:24.990,00:30:26.533,"Okay, okay."
00:30:27.618,00:30:29.536,Okay. This is it.
00:30:32.080,00:30:33.582,"Oh, God."
00:30:46.261,00:30:47.596,Okay.

00:30:51.141,00:30:53.519,Look.

00:30:55.479,00:30:58.982,WALT: He's not supposed to come back.
00:30:58.982,00:31:00.734,"Oh, my God."
00:31:00.734,00:31:03.028,Hope everything comes out all right.
00:31:03.028,00:31:06.490,He's going to the crapper.
00:31:06.490,00:31:09.785,"Okay. You coming, man? Come on."
00:31:42.901,00:31:44.236,"Okay, there it is."
00:31:46.655,00:31:48.365,Is this gonna be loud?
00:31:48.365,00:31:51.076,You'll find out in about 10 seconds.
00:31:52.118,00:31:53.495,Stand back.
00:31:55.664,00:31:57.708,Jesus.
00:32:09.219,00:32:10.970,"Come on, come on."
00:32:12.556,00:32:15.141,"GUARD: Hey, what's going on?"
00:32:19.229,00:32:22.524,Where are the gallon jugs?
00:32:19.229,00:32:25.110,I don't-- God!
00:32:25.110,00:32:27.613,Let's just take this.
00:32:30.156,00:32:31.909,Damn it.
00:32:37.539,00:32:39.416,What are you doing opening the door?
00:32:39.416,00:32:41.334,How are we gonna take this thing out?
00:32:41.334,00:32:43.044,Come on. Take that.
00:32:43.044,00:32:45.380,Lift.
00:32:45.380,00:32:47.257,God.
00:32:49.175,00:32:50.969,Hey. Somebody?
00:32:50.969,00:32:53.096,"MAN: Billy, you back from the crapper yet?"
00:32:53.096,00:32:55.974,GUARD: Let me out of here.
00:32:55.974,00:32:58.852,The alarm's going off.
00:32:58.852,00:33:00.896,Billy?
00:33:00.896,00:33:03.482,Billy?
00:33:03.482,00:33:05.024,Help!
00:33:18.997,00:33:20.415,"JESSE: Come on, let me try."
00:33:20.415,00:33:21.792,How is it gonna be any different?
00:33:21.792,00:33:23.543,Can I just try it?
00:33:23.543,00:33:25.253,Jesus. Okay.
00:33:27.255,00:33:28.632,All right.
00:33:34.471,00:33:38.391,"Yeah, baby. See?"
00:33:38.391,00:33:39.726,"Yeah, okay."

00:33:42.896,00:33:44.523,"No, no. That didn't sound good."
00:33:48.026,00:33:51.363,"Oh, God."
00:33:51.363,00:33:53.615,"Well, this thing's not going anywhere."
00:33:53.615,00:33:57.369,"We're not cooking in my damn driveway, I'll tell you that."
00:34:01.999,00:34:04.417,WALT: God.
00:34:04.417,00:34:07.170,What part of slow it down did you not understand?
00:34:07.170,00:34:11.675,"What are you talking--? I'm-- It's heavy, man."
00:34:11.675,00:34:14.636,WALT: Okay. All right.
00:34:14.636,00:34:17.096,"Now just bring it up, bring it up."
00:34:17.096,00:34:20.266,"Easy, easy, easy. Okay."
00:34:20.266,00:34:23.979,"Your real estate agent, when is she supposed to come back?"
00:34:23.979,00:34:25.605,"Oh, shit."
00:34:25.605,00:34:28.191,Yeah. I don't know.
00:34:28.191,00:34:29.985,I'll make damn sure she doesn't.
00:34:32.612,00:34:34.280,"Good call, yo."
00:35:07.522,00:35:10.776,WALT: Keep the temperature steady at 425 degrees.
00:35:12.027,00:35:16.990,We'll need to run it two more hours to have enough to make 4.5 pounds.
00:35:16.990,00:35:19.284,"Four and a half, not 4?"
00:35:19.284,00:35:22.829,Two pounds pays Tuco back.
00:35:22.829,00:35:27.166,"Four and a half pounds puts us $44,000 ahead."
00:35:27.166,00:35:29.753,Each.
00:35:29.753,00:35:31.755,Right on.
00:35:31.755,00:35:40.597,"With the amount of methylamine that we got last night, we can make 4.5 pounds a week for, well, for the foreseeable future."
00:35:41.848,00:35:45.018,"How long is, uh, that gonna be?"
00:35:45.018,00:35:48.814,"I mean, in your, uh, situation."
00:35:48.814,00:35:51.566,How much cash do you need?
00:35:52.901,00:35:54.694,More.
00:36:00.033,00:36:03.036,Someone's in the yard.
00:36:03.036,00:36:06.331,"MAN: Yeah, this is definitely the one."

00:36:09.334,00:36:11.169,"Actually, I like it."
00:36:11.169,00:36:13.338,We could pull that out and put in a closet.
00:36:13.338,00:36:16.341,Just a little-- We'll have to bring that down.
00:36:16.341,00:36:19.218,MAN: I thought you didn't like that type of thing.
00:36:19.218,00:36:22.221,"WOMAN: Oh, no. No, I don't."
00:36:22.221,00:36:24.182,"MAN: Right, right."
00:36:28.854,00:36:33.608,"Was there, by any chance, scheduled for this afternoon, an open house?"
00:36:33.608,00:36:35.986,I left her a message.
00:36:35.986,00:36:39.865,"I don't care how you do it, just keep them out of here."
00:36:39.865,00:36:41.908,Yeah.
00:37:03.262,00:37:05.348,WOMAN: Absolutely.
00:37:10.896,00:37:13.231,"You know, you can't duck me forever."
00:37:13.231,00:37:14.607,What?
00:37:14.607,00:37:16.985,"Come on, I left you, like, 15 messages."
00:37:16.985,00:37:19.696,"When I went to your office, you snuck out the back."
00:37:19.696,00:37:22.741,I didn't sneak.
00:37:22.741,00:37:24.492,"Skyler, what are you, the paranoid police?"
00:37:24.492,00:37:26.036,"You know what, Marie?"
00:37:26.036,00:37:29.497,"Marie, I have never been so humiliated in my life."
00:37:29.497,00:37:35.128,That-- That tiara.
00:37:35.128,00:37:39.298,"They accused me, at Zachary's, of shoplifting it."
00:37:39.298,00:37:40.842,What were you doing at Zachary's?
00:37:42.510,00:37:45.222,I was returning it.
00:37:45.222,00:37:48.474,You were returning it.
00:37:48.474,00:37:49.935,Why would you return it?
00:37:49.935,00:37:56.733,"It just wasn't-- Marie, what is wrong with you?"
00:37:56.733,00:38:00.153,Can you tell me why you'd do such a thing?
00:38:03.031,00:38:06.576,What does that mean?
00:38:06.576,00:38:13.833,That means that I have no idea what the hell you're even talking about.
00:38:13.833,00:38:17.045,You have no idea what I'm talking about.
00:38:17.045,00:38:22.926,The shop-- The shoplifting. No idea?
00:38:24.677,00:38:27.889,"You're not going to admit this, are you?"
00:38:29.015,00:38:35.605,I can't really admit to something when I have no knowledge of what it is that I'm admitting.
00:38:52.497,00:38:54.207,MAN: Would you like that gift-wrapped?
00:38:54.207,00:38:55.583,"WOMAN; Yes, actually."

00:39:07.012,00:39:10.098,You're right.
00:39:10.098,00:39:12.391,Look at this wall here.
00:39:23.820,00:39:26.364,"MAN: Excuse me, I'd just like to see the basement."
00:39:26.364,00:39:28.700,"Yeah, well, it's occupied."
00:39:28.700,00:39:31.119,Hey!
00:39:31.119,00:39:32.537,What's the big deal?
00:39:32.537,00:39:35.040,"Yo, you ain't seeing the basement, bitch."
00:39:35.040,00:39:37.709,"You got that? Is that sinking in? Now, beat it."
00:39:37.709,00:39:40.628,"All you all, house is not for sale."
00:39:40.628,00:39:42.005,Get the hell out.
00:40:22.170,00:40:24.463,Hey.
00:40:27.217,00:40:29.302,So how was it?
00:40:29.302,00:40:33.514,"Was it, uh, an experience?"
00:40:33.514,00:40:35.225,Yeah.
00:40:35.225,00:40:38.186,It was definitely an experience.
00:40:44.276,00:40:45.944,What's that smell?
00:40:45.944,00:40:52.867,"Oh, yeah, it's sacred Navajo herbs."
00:40:52.867,00:40:54.660,You know.
00:41:07.215,00:41:10.635,"Hey, everything okay?"
00:41:10.635,00:41:12.220,No.
00:41:12.220,00:41:14.180,Not really.
00:41:14.180,00:41:15.514,Huh.
00:41:15.514,00:41:18.726,"Actually, not at all."
00:41:20.270,00:41:23.898,"You know that, uh, tiara that Marie gave us?"
00:41:23.898,00:41:29.862,Yeah.
00:41:29.862,00:41:34.075,I practically got arrested trying to return it at the store.
00:41:34.075,00:41:35.785,"Oh, my God."
00:41:35.785,00:41:39.914,"I mean, she refuses to admit it."
00:41:39.914,00:41:41.249,I don't know what to do.
00:41:42.959,00:41:44.252,Hm.
00:41:48.547,00:41:52.593,People sometimes do things for their families.
00:41:54.429,00:41:58.224,People sometimes do things for their families?
00:41:58.224,00:42:01.269,"And what, that justifies stealing?"
00:42:02.603,00:42:04.314,Well...
00:42:04.314,00:42:08.818,Wow. That must've been some sweat lodge.
00:42:15.533,00:42:18.119,What would you do if it were me?
00:42:20.705,00:42:23.666,"What do you mean, if it were you?"
00:42:23.666,00:42:27.462,"If it were me, what would you do? Would you divorce me?"
00:42:27.462,00:42:31.341,Would you turn me in to the police?
00:42:40.641,00:42:42.852,You don't want to find out.
00:42:54.364,00:42:55.740,You want something to eat?
00:42:58.701,00:43:01.287,"Um, no, thanks."
00:43:18.179,00:43:20.557,What is this shit?
00:43:22.392,00:43:26.812,"We used a different chemical process, but it is every bit as pure."
00:43:26.812,00:43:29.899,"It may be blue, but it's the bomb."
00:43:37.490,00:43:40.993,"Tight, tight, tight, yeah."
00:43:40.993,00:43:43.037,"Blue, yellow, pink."
00:43:43.037,00:43:44.830,Just keep bringing me that.
00:43:54.966,00:43:57.009,4.6.
00:43:58.094,00:44:00.513,Come on.
00:44:00.513,00:44:03.933,"And what'd I say, man?"
00:44:03.933,00:44:06.060,"You're all right, man."
00:44:06.060,00:44:09.772,We're gonna make a lot of money together.
00:44:09.772,00:44:11.816,Just remember who you're working for.
00:44:15.487,00:44:17.405,What did you say?
00:44:17.405,00:44:20.408,"I'm just saying, they gotta know that they're working for you."
00:44:20.408,00:44:23.161,TUCO: Like they don't already know that?
00:44:23.161,00:44:27.039,Are you saying that they're stupid?
00:44:27.039,00:44:30.418,"No, I'm just-- I'm just saying."
00:44:30.418,00:44:33.212,"Okay, so you're not saying that they're stupid."
00:44:33.212,00:44:36.048,So I don't understand.
00:44:36.048,00:44:39.135,"MAN: No, come on, Tuco. I'm just-- I'm just saying."
00:44:39.135,00:44:41.179,"No, you're just speaking for me!"
00:44:41.179,00:44:45.808,Like I ain't got the goddamn sense to speak for myself!
00:44:45.808,00:44:48.936,Is that it?
00:44:48.936,00:44:50.271,Tuco.
00:44:51.230,00:44:53.983,Tuco.
00:44:53.983,00:44:58.279,"Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?"
00:45:05.077,00:45:08.331,Heisenberg says relax.
00:45:14.128,00:45:17.131,I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.
00:45:17.131,00:45:34.773,I'm relax-- Whoo!
00:45:34.773,00:45:37.485,"Damn, man! Look at that! Look!"
00:45:37.485,00:45:39.529,Whoo.
00:45:40.488,00:45:41.780,That is messed up.
00:45:43.991,00:45:46.369,"Okay, Heisenberg."
00:45:46.369,00:45:47.662,Next week.
