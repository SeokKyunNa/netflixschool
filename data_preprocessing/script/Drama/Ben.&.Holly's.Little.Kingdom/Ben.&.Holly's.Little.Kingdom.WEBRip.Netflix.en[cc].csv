00:00:05.320,00:00:10.240,is a little kingdom of elves and fairies.
00:00:10.240,00:00:15.240,"Everyone who lives here is very, very small."
00:00:15.240,00:00:16.640,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:18.400,00:00:21.280,And I'm Princess Holly.
00:00:22.560,00:00:24.440,"Come on, let's play."
00:00:24.440,00:00:26.600,Wait for us.
00:00:36.600,00:00:43.800,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:00:52.320,00:00:54.720,I'm going to visit my sister today.
00:00:54.720,00:00:56.320,Will you be all right on your own?
00:00:56.320,00:00:59.000,"Yes, Mommy, I'll be okay."
00:00:59.000,00:01:00.960,"Don't worry, Queen Thistle."
00:01:00.960,00:01:02.440,We'll be fine.
00:01:02.440,00:01:05.360,"Yes, darling, we'll all be fine."
00:01:05.360,00:01:08.960,"You'll be fine, but what about Daisy and Poppy?"
00:01:08.960,00:01:10.640,They need looking after.
00:01:10.640,00:01:12.760,Oh. Daisy and Poppy.
00:01:13.960,00:01:19.800,"But, Mommy, when you're not here, the twins are always so naughty."
00:01:19.800,00:01:21.920,"BOTH: Heh, heh. Magicky, magicky."
00:01:23.080,00:01:26.600,"Uh, yes."
00:01:26.600,00:01:29.720,What a lot of fuss about two tiny children.
00:01:29.720,00:01:31.400,Just let them play.
00:01:31.400,00:01:34.040,But don't let them do any magic.
00:01:34.040,00:01:35.880,"NANNY &amp; HOLLY: Yes, Queen Thistle."
00:01:35.880,00:01:38.160,And read them a story before they go to bed.
00:01:38.160,00:01:40.040,ALL: Yes.
00:01:40.040,00:01:42.200,"Goodbye, everyone. Have fun."
00:01:42.200,00:01:44.360,ALL: Bye-bye.
00:01:44.360,00:01:46.560,"So, what are we going to do?"
00:01:46.560,00:01:49.960,Mommy's the only one who can handle the twins.
00:01:49.960,00:01:52.360,Don't worry.
00:01:52.360,00:01:53.880,Um...
00:01:53.880,00:01:58.760,I think I've got some important things to do in the kitchen.
00:01:56.560,00:02:01.600,"But, Nanny, aren't you going to help us look after the twins?"
00:02:01.600,00:02:06.080,"I'm sure you, Ben and King Thistle can manage."
00:02:06.080,00:02:09.640,Right. We just need to keep the twins busy.
00:02:10.960,00:02:14.120,I know.
00:02:14.120,00:02:17.240,It has to be something safe.
00:02:17.240,00:02:19.360,What about building blocks?
00:02:19.360,00:02:21.240,That can't go too wrong.
00:02:21.240,00:02:22.880,Okay...
00:02:24.160,00:02:27.040,Watch Daddy build a big tower.
00:02:28.200,00:02:35.000,Magic me a tower And make it big BOTH: Ooh.
00:02:35.000,00:02:41.960,"Big, big Mommy said not to let the twins do magic."
00:02:41.960,00:02:44.480,"Ho, ho. Don't worry, Holly."
00:02:44.480,00:02:48.080,It's easy to make blocks little again.
00:02:48.080,00:02:52.920,"Little, little There. You see, Holly?"
00:02:52.920,00:03:00.680,"BOTH: Little, little Uh, Daisy, Poppy, give Daddy your wands."
00:03:00.680,00:03:04.200,"BOTH: Little, little Help!"
00:03:04.200,00:03:05.520,Wow.
00:03:05.520,00:03:07.760,They've made King Thistle really small.
00:03:07.760,00:03:09.680,Daisy. Poppy.
00:03:09.680,00:03:12.320,That wasn't funny or clever.
00:03:12.320,00:03:18.720,"Little, little BOTH: Little, little They've made us little."
00:03:18.720,00:03:22.640,Don't worry. I'll magic us back to normal size.
00:03:22.640,00:03:25.000,I just need my wand.
00:03:26.360,00:03:28.760,My wand's too heavy.
00:03:28.760,00:03:30.560,I can't lift it.
00:03:30.560,00:03:33.280,Maybe we should call Nanny Plum.
00:03:33.280,00:03:34.880,"Good idea, Ben."
00:03:34.880,00:03:36.880,I'll ring the bell.
00:03:45.240,00:03:48.960,We need to pull harder.
00:03:52.000,00:03:55.680,Oh. I wonder what they want.
00:03:58.400,00:03:59.880,Typical.
00:03:59.880,00:04:03.400,"They ring for me, and then they wander off somewhere."
00:04:03.400,00:04:05.600,KING: Nanny Plum!
00:04:05.600,00:04:07.200,Eh?
00:04:07.200,00:04:08.600,ALL: We're here.
00:04:09.800,00:04:12.240,Why are you so tiny?
00:04:12.240,00:04:16.800,"Um, Daisy and Poppy did a spell on us."
00:04:16.800,00:04:18.320,Honestly.
00:04:18.320,00:04:20.800,It's not hard to look after Daisy and Poppy.
00:04:20.800,00:04:22.840,You just have to play with them.
00:04:22.840,00:04:27.720,"We tried that, Nanny Plum, but it went a bit wrong."
00:04:27.720,00:04:31.680,What Daisy and Poppy like most is their baby dolly.
00:04:31.680,00:04:33.200,"Now, where is it?"
00:04:33.200,00:04:34.480,BOTH: Boo!
00:04:34.480,00:04:36.520,Oh. Daisy and Poppy.
00:04:36.520,00:04:38.680,Where have you put your baby dolly?
00:04:38.680,00:04:45.920,"BOTH: Baby dolly, baby dolly Hello. I'm Baby Plum."
00:04:49.280,00:04:51.000,"Change my nappy, please."
00:04:52.320,00:04:53.560,"Oh, no."
00:04:53.560,00:04:56.320,They've changed Nanny into a doll.
00:05:00.320,00:05:01.640,"Feed me, please."
00:05:02.840,00:05:05.400,What are we going to do?
00:05:05.400,00:05:07.160,We need to get help.
00:05:07.160,00:05:09.240,Let's call my mom.
00:05:09.240,00:05:11.120,She'll know what to do.
00:05:11.120,00:05:12.800,"Good thinking, Ben."
00:05:18.280,00:05:20.080,This is heavy.
00:05:20.080,00:05:22.920,All together. Push.
00:05:35.280,00:05:37.640,"Hello, Mrs. Elf speaking."
00:05:37.640,00:05:40.320,"BEN: Mom. It's me, Ben."
00:05:40.320,00:05:43.560,Oh. Ben.
00:05:43.560,00:05:47.000,Yes.
00:05:47.000,00:05:48.640,Please come quick.
00:05:48.640,00:05:50.240,Right-o.
00:05:50.240,00:05:52.160,She's on her way.
00:05:52.160,00:05:54.240,Thank goodness.
00:05:54.240,00:05:57.720,I wonder what the matter can be?
00:06:04.280,00:06:05.560,"Bath me, please."
00:06:07.240,00:06:10.640,"Hello, Daisy."
00:06:10.640,00:06:13.480,Can you tell me where the big children are?
00:06:13.480,00:06:15.200,HOLLY: We're down here.
00:06:16.360,00:06:20.280,Daisy and Poppy put a spell on us.
00:06:20.280,00:06:22.920,And we need a bit of help.
00:06:22.920,00:06:25.560,"Your Majesty. Heh, heh."
00:06:25.560,00:06:28.720,We do seem to have got ourselves in a bit of a pickle.
00:06:28.720,00:06:30.440,"Uh, yes."
00:06:30.440,00:06:34.000,The twins are a little high-spirited today.
00:06:34.000,00:06:36.920,"Could you calm them down, please?"
00:06:36.920,00:06:38.560,Of course.
00:06:38.560,00:06:41.120,"Now, now, Daisy and Poppy."
00:06:41.120,00:06:43.440,I'm sure you're not meant to fly so high.
00:06:44.640,00:06:50.680,"Fly so high, fly so high Fly so high Whoa!"
00:06:50.680,00:06:58.680,"DAISY: MRS. ELF: Now, girls, put me down this instant."
00:06:58.680,00:07:02.720,Poor Mrs. Elf.
00:07:02.720,00:07:06.400,Looks like we need even more help.
00:07:06.400,00:07:09.440,I'll call for more elves.
00:07:15.400,00:07:17.480,"Hello, Mr. Elf speaking."
00:07:17.480,00:07:21.320,Mr. Elf. We've got an emergency at the Little Castle.
00:07:21.320,00:07:22.800,Bring the elves.
00:07:22.800,00:07:25.360,Bring all the elves.
00:07:25.360,00:07:28.000,Right-o.
00:07:30.200,00:07:32.240,Calling all elves!
00:07:32.240,00:07:35.480,Emergency at the Little Castle.
00:07:35.480,00:07:37.200,ALL: Right-o!
00:07:39.280,00:07:43.040,If there's a problem what do we say?
00:07:43.040,00:07:46.920,"ALL: Call an elf, right away And what are we?"
00:07:46.920,00:07:48.840,ALL: We're elves!
00:07:49.880,00:07:56.080,BOTH: The elves are here.
00:07:56.080,00:07:57.320,MRS. ELF: It's the twins.
00:07:57.320,00:08:00.080,"Is that you, Mrs. Elf?"
00:08:00.080,00:08:02.840,"MRS. ELF: Uh, up here, Mr. Elf."
00:08:02.840,00:08:04.640,"Goodness me, Mrs. Elf."
00:08:04.640,00:08:07.600,I thought you were invisible.
00:08:08.680,00:08:15.880,"BOTH: Invisible Oh, no. The twins have made all the elves invisible."
00:08:17.040,00:08:19.200,Who's going to help us now?
00:08:23.600,00:08:26.320,"Hm, it's very quiet in the castle."
00:08:26.320,00:08:28.480,I hope everything's all right.
00:08:30.360,00:08:32.720,"Hello, my little ones."
00:08:32.720,00:08:35.280,"BOTH: Mommy, Mommy."
00:08:35.280,00:08:37.520,"My goodness, you look tired."
00:08:37.520,00:08:41.680,"Have you been playing with Holly, Ben and Daddy all day?"
00:08:41.680,00:08:44.400,"Uh, where is Daddy?"
00:08:44.400,00:08:46.320,"Glad you're home, darling."
00:08:46.320,00:08:49.040,Have you had a nice day?
00:08:49.040,00:08:50.760,Why are you so tiny?
00:08:50.760,00:08:54.480,Daisy and Poppy have been a bit naughty.
00:08:54.480,00:08:57.080,They've made us little.
00:08:57.080,00:08:58.280,I see.
00:08:58.280,00:08:59.960,And where is Nanny Plum?
00:08:59.960,00:09:03.120,"Uh, she's been turned into that doll."
00:09:03.120,00:09:05.720,Press her tummy.
00:09:08.880,00:09:11.440,"Change my nappy, please."
00:09:12.800,00:09:14.480,I see.
00:09:14.480,00:09:19.720,"My mom tried to help, but that didn't work out too well either."
00:09:19.720,00:09:21.680,And where is your Mom?
00:09:21.680,00:09:24.280,"MRS. ELF: Up here, Your Majesty."
00:09:24.280,00:09:28.480,I'm afraid the twins have done something to all the other elves too.
00:09:28.480,00:09:30.080,What other elves?
00:09:30.080,00:09:31.600,Where are they?
00:09:31.600,00:09:35.320,"ELVES: We're here, Your Majesty."
00:09:36.800,00:09:40.240,Right. And all this is Daisy and Poppy's doing?
00:09:40.240,00:09:41.720,ALL: Yes!
00:09:41.720,00:09:44.720,Okay. Let's put everything right again.
00:09:45.880,00:09:55.720,"Make this magic all undone Good evening, Your Majesty."
00:09:55.720,00:10:04.160,"So are you telling me that I've gone away for just one day, and the whole kingdom couldn't look after two little children?"
00:10:04.160,00:10:05.800,Uh... Yes.
00:10:07.480,00:10:09.680,"We tried our best, Mommy."
00:10:09.680,00:10:13.360,But the twins really are a bit of a handful.
00:10:15.240,00:10:18.840,"Ho-ho-ho. Thinking about it, they weren't that bad."
00:10:18.840,00:10:20.760,"It was rather fun, really."
00:10:20.760,00:10:22.360,Ha-ha-ha. Yes.
00:10:22.360,00:10:28.600,"I'm sure if you went away again, Queen Thistle, we'd manage just fine."
00:10:28.600,00:10:30.080,That's good.
00:10:30.080,00:10:33.480,"Because I'm going to visit my sister again, next week."
00:10:33.480,00:10:35.000,ALL: No!
00:10:38.520,00:10:45.880,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:10:50.520,00:10:52.840,Let's check you're all here.
00:10:52.840,00:10:58.440,"Holly, Violet, Rosie, and Strawberry. Good."
00:10:58.440,00:11:00.080,"Now, hold hands."
00:11:00.080,00:11:03.800,I don't want to lose any of you in the woods.
00:11:06.560,00:11:11.000,"Nanny Plum, do we have to do nature class today?"
00:11:11.000,00:11:13.440,It's boring.
00:11:13.440,00:11:17.320,Yes. All we do is learn the names of trees.
00:11:17.320,00:11:19.080,And mushrooms.
00:11:19.080,00:11:21.160,And frogs.
00:11:21.160,00:11:22.520,"Now, now, girls."
00:11:22.520,00:11:26.240,Every young fairy needs to know the names of trees and mushrooms.
00:11:26.240,00:11:27.720,And frogs?
00:11:27.720,00:11:30.560,And frogs.
00:11:30.560,00:11:35.640,Up ahead is a lovely example of a mugwort flower.
00:11:37.280,00:11:43.480,"Ben, Barnaby, Jake, and Lizzy. Good."
00:11:43.480,00:11:47.040,Today we are having nature class.
00:11:47.040,00:11:48.960,Follow me.
00:11:48.960,00:11:50.440,"Excuse me, Wise Old Elf."
00:11:50.440,00:11:53.600,Why do we have to do nature class?
00:11:53.600,00:12:01.200,"Because, Ben, it's important that every young elf learns about nature."
00:12:02.520,00:12:05.440,Who can tell me what this is?
00:12:05.440,00:12:07.120,Um...
00:12:07.120,00:12:10.480,Uh...
00:12:10.480,00:12:15.280,A welted thistle is the correct answer.
00:12:15.280,00:12:16.600,Oh.
00:12:16.600,00:12:18.280,"Now, what's the name of this flower?"
00:12:18.280,00:12:21.360,Oh. We seem to have walked into some elves.
00:12:21.360,00:12:24.320,"Good day, Nanny Plum."
00:12:24.320,00:12:26.080,"Hello, Wise Old Elf."
00:12:26.080,00:12:28.400,"Hi, Ben."
00:12:28.400,00:12:30.360,We're doing nature class.
00:12:30.360,00:12:31.600,So are we.
00:12:31.600,00:12:33.800,Let's team up.
00:12:36.360,00:12:38.880,I'm not sure about this.
00:12:38.880,00:12:40.400,Quite so.
00:12:40.400,00:12:45.200,"Elf and fairy nature classes are very, very different."
00:12:45.200,00:12:48.400,We're learning names of plants and things.
00:12:48.400,00:12:49.800,So are we.
00:12:49.800,00:12:53.960,"Please, Nanny Plum, can we have one big class?"
00:12:53.960,00:12:56.400,"Please, Mr. Wise Old Elf?"
00:12:56.400,00:12:57.920,"Oh, very well."
00:12:57.920,00:13:00.520,I suppose I can handle a few more children.
00:13:00.520,00:13:02.400,What?
00:13:00.520,00:13:04.560,"Wise Old Elf, there's no need for you to hang around."
00:13:04.560,00:13:09.160,But-- But-- You can collect your children when my lesson's over.
00:13:09.160,00:13:20.400,"No doubt there's some charming fairy name for this plant, but my class has identified it correctly as a welted thistle."
00:13:20.400,00:13:23.880,Oh. Isn't it hairy bittercress?
00:13:23.880,00:13:26.400,Oh. Interesting.
00:13:26.400,00:13:28.240,Or hairy bogweed.
00:13:28.240,00:13:31.480,You both know the silly plant names.
00:13:31.480,00:13:35.000,So you should both take the class.
00:13:35.000,00:13:38.080,Hm. On one condition.
00:13:38.080,00:13:40.680,No magic.
00:13:40.680,00:13:44.760,"I'm doing nature class today, not magic class."
00:13:44.760,00:13:47.040,So it's agreed.
00:13:47.040,00:13:48.240,Let's go.
00:13:56.160,00:13:57.360,Look.
00:13:57.360,00:13:59.600,Ah. An acorn.
00:13:59.600,00:14:04.200,"Now, what does an acorn grow into?"
00:14:04.200,00:14:06.600,Is the answer an oak tree?
00:14:06.600,00:14:08.880,I was asking the children.
00:14:08.880,00:14:11.800,"Yes, yes. But an oak tree is the right answer?"
00:14:11.800,00:14:21.760,What the Wise Old Elf is trying to say is that this little acorn will grow into a huge oak tree.
00:14:21.760,00:14:23.320,ALL: Ooh.
00:14:23.320,00:14:25.960,Cool.
00:14:25.960,00:14:31.520,"Ho, ho. It will take years and years to grow into a tree."
00:14:31.520,00:14:32.800,ALL: Aw.
00:14:32.800,00:14:35.920,We could give it some magical help.
00:14:35.920,00:14:41.440,"Nanny Plum, we agreed. No magic."
00:14:41.440,00:14:45.160,But look at the children's sad little faces.
00:14:45.160,00:14:48.800,They'd so like to see the acorn grow into a tree.
00:14:48.800,00:14:50.400,No.
00:14:50.400,00:14:54.200,"Please, Nanny Plum, make the acorn grow into a tree."
00:14:54.200,00:14:57.400,"ALL: Yes. Please, Nanny Plum."
00:14:57.400,00:15:00.960,I'd love to.
00:15:00.960,00:15:03.800,"ALL: Please, Wise Old Elf."
00:15:03.800,00:15:06.400,"Oh, very well."
00:15:06.400,00:15:08.160,I'll just do a little spell.
00:15:08.160,00:15:10.800,"Stand back, children."
00:15:10.800,00:15:14.320,"Just a small tree, please."
00:15:14.320,00:15:15.600,"Yes, yes."
00:15:15.600,00:15:24.760,"Thunder and lightning North winds blow Little acorn Grow, grow, grow ALL: Whoa!"
00:15:26.600,00:15:28.000,ALL: Wow.
00:15:29.760,00:15:35.480,"Nanny Plum, is that your idea of a small tree?"
00:15:35.480,00:15:38.080,"Um, it is big, isn't it?"
00:15:38.080,00:15:40.960,But I can easily make it smaller.
00:15:40.960,00:15:43.760,"No, no. It's fine as it is."
00:15:43.760,00:15:45.360,Let's move on.
00:15:45.360,00:15:49.280,"Next up, mushrooms."
00:15:49.280,00:15:51.800,"Ah, good. Mushrooms."
00:15:53.360,00:15:56.640,Who can tell me what this is?
00:15:56.640,00:15:57.840,A toadstool.
00:15:57.840,00:16:00.600,"Uh, yes, correct."
00:16:00.600,00:16:05.120,"Now, you should never, ever eat a toadstool."
00:16:05.120,00:16:12.560,"It would make you very-- What Mister Old Elf is trying to say is that you should never, ever eat a toadstool."
00:16:12.560,00:16:14.600,It would make you very sick.
00:16:14.600,00:16:15.960,Indeed.
00:16:15.960,00:16:20.200,"So never, ever eat a toadstool."
00:16:20.200,00:16:22.360,"ALL: Yes, Wise Old Elf."
00:16:22.360,00:16:25.640,"Of course, I expect the Wise Old Elf would like to sit on it."
00:16:25.640,00:16:26.880,What?
00:16:26.880,00:16:28.760,Elves love sitting on toadstools.
00:16:28.760,00:16:35.440,"Madam, I think you will find it is gnomes that sit on toadstools."
00:16:35.440,00:16:37.480,"Elves, gnomes, whatever."
00:16:37.480,00:16:41.680,You would never catch an elf sitting on a toadstool.
00:16:41.680,00:16:43.840,"Hello, everyone."
00:16:43.840,00:16:45.320,"Hello, Mr. Elf."
00:16:45.320,00:16:47.840,"Hello, Holly."
00:16:45.320,00:16:50.720,I see you've found my special reading place.
00:16:50.720,00:16:54.640,"Ah, it just catches the sun at this time of day."
00:16:54.640,00:16:56.240,"Uh, ahem."
00:16:56.240,00:17:01.040,"Yes, uh, here we have a toadstool."
00:17:01.040,00:17:02.320,With an elf on top.
00:17:02.320,00:17:06.000,"Um, yes."
00:17:06.000,00:17:07.680,He looks very happy.
00:17:07.680,00:17:09.680,Right. Let's move on.
00:17:09.680,00:17:12.720,"Yes, we have time for one last thing."
00:17:12.720,00:17:14.840,"ALL: Goodbye, Mr. Elf."
00:17:14.840,00:17:17.360,Bye.
00:17:17.360,00:17:20.200,What do you think the last thing is?
00:17:20.200,00:17:22.360,I bet it's frogs.
00:17:22.360,00:17:25.440,Nanny always shows us frogs.
00:17:25.440,00:17:28.840,"Yes, it'll be frogs."
00:17:30.080,00:17:33.360,Who can guess what we're going to see next?
00:17:33.360,00:17:35.280,Frogs.
00:17:35.280,00:17:38.200,Yes. We're going to look at frogs.
00:17:38.200,00:17:41.360,"Um, there aren't any frogs here."
00:17:41.360,00:17:43.280,Not one frog.
00:17:43.280,00:17:44.920,"Well, that's disappointing."
00:17:44.920,00:17:46.680,Can we go home now?
00:17:46.680,00:17:50.080,It's no problem. I'll turn one of us into a frog.
00:17:50.080,00:17:52.480,"Can I have a volunteer, please?"
00:17:52.480,00:17:56.920,Come on.
00:17:56.920,00:18:00.080,Goodness.
00:18:00.080,00:18:01.720,I'll just have to do it myself.
00:18:02.920,00:18:09.840,Zig zag zog Make me into a frog ALL: Wow.
00:18:09.840,00:18:12.840,Ahem. A common frog.
00:18:12.840,00:18:16.040,Look how slimy it is.
00:18:18.800,00:18:21.240,WISE OLD ELF: And how smelly it is.
00:18:22.360,00:18:26.200,"ALL: Aah, stinky wiffy poo."
00:18:26.200,00:18:28.520,And how silly it sounds.
00:18:30.920,00:18:38.120,"Well, that brings today's nature class to a most satisfactory close."
00:18:38.120,00:18:42.200,"Uh, Nanny Plum, you can turn yourself back now."
00:18:43.400,00:18:47.320,I don't think Nanny Plum can turn herself back again.
00:18:47.320,00:18:49.720,She can't pick up her wand.
00:18:49.720,00:18:51.560,"Oh, what a shame."
00:18:51.560,00:18:53.720,"Now, for your homework..."
00:18:53.720,00:18:57.880,But Nanny Plum.
00:18:57.880,00:18:59.600,Can't we?
00:18:59.600,00:19:02.000,"Oh, I suppose not."
00:19:02.000,00:19:05.240,"Uh, which fairy wants to turn her back again?"
00:19:05.240,00:19:06.920,ALL: Me! Me! Me!
00:19:06.920,00:19:10.240,All right.
00:19:10.240,00:19:15.240,"Um, I'm not sure what spell to use."
00:19:15.240,00:19:20.240,I'm sure Nanny Plum would want you to just have a go anyway.
00:19:20.240,00:19:23.360,Okay. I'll try this.
00:19:23.360,00:19:26.480,Abraca zairy-- Um...
00:19:26.480,00:19:30.920,Frog to fairy Oh! It works.
00:19:30.920,00:19:32.640,"Ah! Thank you, Holly."
00:19:32.640,00:19:36.440,"Oops. Sorry, Nanny."
00:19:36.440,00:19:38.160,"You did very well, Holly."
00:19:39.440,00:19:41.400,But you shook your wand a bit too hard.
00:19:42.480,00:19:48.960,Abraca zairy Frog to fairy KIDS: Hooray!
00:19:48.960,00:19:52.760,"You see, children, it's all in the wand control."
00:19:52.760,00:19:54.560,"ALL: Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:19:54.560,00:19:57.480,"Fascinating, Mistress Plum."
00:19:57.480,00:20:02.240,"But if we might return to nature class for a-- Yes, children."
00:20:02.240,00:20:09.840,What Mr. Old Elf is trying to say is that-- That brings today's nature class to a...
00:20:09.840,00:20:12.240,BOTH: Close.
00:20:12.240,00:20:15.560,That was the bestest ever nature class.
00:20:15.560,00:20:17.800,"Thank you, Strawberry."
00:20:17.800,00:20:20.560,It was excellently cool.
00:20:20.560,00:20:22.560,"Thank you, Barnaby."
00:20:22.560,00:20:30.960,"So from now on, Nanny Plum and the Wise Old Elf always teach us nature class together."
00:20:30.960,00:20:33.240,Uh... All right.
00:20:33.240,00:20:35.920,Ho-ho-ho.
00:20:35.920,00:20:37.520,KIDS: Hooray!
00:00:01.480,00:00:10.280,"NARRATOR: Somewhere, hidden amongst thorny brambles, is a little kingdom of elves and fairies."
00:00:10.280,00:00:15.200,"Everyone who lives here is very, very small."
00:00:15.200,00:00:16.680,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:18.240,00:00:21.200,And I'm Princess Holly.
00:00:22.440,00:00:24.280,"Come on, let's play."
00:00:36.720,00:00:43.120,Today's adventure starts at the little castle.
00:00:51.400,00:00:54.360,Today we will be having porridge for breakfast.
00:00:55.880,00:00:57.640,Porridge!
00:00:57.640,00:01:01.200,But the porridge pot is empty.
00:01:01.200,00:01:09.200,"Yes, Holly. Daisy and Poppy will be practicing their magic this morning Nanny Plum has taught them a simple porridge spell."
00:01:09.200,00:01:12.080,BOTH: Wandy! Wandy!
00:01:12.080,00:01:15.160,I've got a bad feeling about this.
00:01:15.160,00:01:19.400,"Just to be clear, Nanny Plum, nothing's going to go wrong, is it?"
00:01:19.400,00:01:20.800,"No, Your Majesty."
00:01:20.800,00:01:24.280,I don't want another magic jelly flood.
00:01:24.280,00:01:25.440,That was jelly.
00:01:25.440,00:01:27.680,Porridge is a very different beast.
00:01:27.680,00:01:31.160,And Daisy and Poppy have been practicing so hard.
00:01:32.440,00:01:40.120,"Little porridge pot Fill, fill, fill Well done, Daisy and Poppy."
00:01:40.120,00:01:43.520,"Hee, hee! The twins should make breakfast more often."
00:01:43.520,00:01:46.080,Hm. It's quite tasty.
00:01:46.080,00:01:48.240,BOTH: More! More! More!
00:01:48.240,00:01:50.960,QUEEN: Daisy! Poppy! Stop!
00:01:50.960,00:01:53.640,BOTH: More! More! More! More!
00:01:58.760,00:02:02.360,"Little porridge pot, stop!"
00:02:03.280,00:02:04.880,Yuck!
00:02:04.880,00:02:10.920,"I'm covered in horrible gooey porridge, thanks to my silly little sisters."
00:02:12.120,00:02:16.160,"Now, now, Holly. Remember, Daisy and Poppy are only babies."
00:02:16.160,00:02:19.800,And we'll have this porridge cleared up in a flash.
00:02:21.680,00:02:24.920,I'd forgotten the twins knew how to say more.
00:02:24.920,00:02:26.320,BOTH: More! More!
00:02:26.320,00:02:27.760,Aw.
00:02:27.760,00:02:30.600,"When I was a baby, the first words I said was bang!"
00:02:30.600,00:02:33.240,That's not a good word for a magical baby to know.
00:02:33.240,00:02:36.080,Bang!
00:02:38.080,00:02:39.560,QUEEN: Give Mommy your wands.
00:02:43.640,00:02:48.040,"I'll be off then, My friends are coming round to play."
00:02:48.040,00:02:55.640,"KING: Ah, yes, Holly, Mommy and I were thinking it would be fun if you and your friends played with Daisy and Poppy today."
00:02:55.640,00:02:57.440,"But, Daddy."
00:02:57.440,00:03:00.360,QUEEN: It would be a chance for the twins to learn your games.
00:03:00.360,00:03:01.880,"But, Mommy."
00:03:07.160,00:03:09.840,"Hi, Holly."
00:03:09.840,00:03:12.160,"Coming out to play, Holly?"
00:03:12.160,00:03:16.680,"Sorry, Fleur, I can't come out to play."
00:03:16.680,00:03:18.240,Why not?
00:03:18.240,00:03:24.160,"Uh, Daisy and Poppy are with me, so we have to play in the courtyard."
00:03:26.080,00:03:28.720,Aw. They're so sweet and ickle.
00:03:28.720,00:03:30.600,They're not sweet.
00:03:30.600,00:03:32.800,"Wandy, wandy!"
00:03:32.800,00:03:36.840,Do you want to hold my wand?
00:03:36.840,00:03:38.600,"No, Fleur."
00:03:38.600,00:03:42.080,Kitty cat!
00:03:45.800,00:03:47.280,Aah!
00:03:47.280,00:03:50.320,I see your friends have brought a little kitten along.
00:03:51.720,00:03:56.000,"Uh, that's Fleur."
00:03:56.000,00:03:58.160,I see.
00:03:58.160,00:04:07.120,"Run away, kitten Come back, Fleur And which poor friend was turned into this insect?"
00:04:07.120,00:04:11.000,"No, Mommy."
00:04:11.000,00:04:14.120,He is meant to be like that.
00:04:14.120,00:04:16.040,"Ah, yes, of course."
00:04:16.040,00:04:18.560,"Hello, Gaston."
00:04:18.560,00:04:23.720,"Now, children, the twins are only little, so please play gently."
00:04:23.720,00:04:25.720,"ALL: Yes, Queen Thistle."
00:04:25.720,00:04:29.040,And the twins must stay in the courtyard.
00:04:29.040,00:04:30.520,"Yes, Mommy."
00:04:30.520,00:04:32.760,Have fun.
00:04:35.800,00:04:39.520,Wow! Your little sisters are something else.
00:04:39.520,00:04:42.400,I know.
00:04:42.400,00:04:45.200,"So keep hold of your wand, Fleur."
00:04:45.200,00:04:48.240,But they're so sweet and ickle.
00:04:48.240,00:04:52.120,I'm sure they didn't mean to turn me into a kitten.
00:04:52.120,00:04:54.880,"Meow, meow."
00:04:54.880,00:04:57.680,"So, what game shall we play?"
00:04:57.680,00:04:59.960,How about hide-and-seek?
00:04:59.960,00:05:01.920,"BOTH: Hidey, hidey!"
00:05:01.920,00:05:06.640,"The only problem is, the twins can't count yet."
00:05:06.640,00:05:10.920,I'll help them count.
00:05:10.920,00:05:12.120,BEN: Okay.
00:05:12.120,00:05:14.840,"Now, close your little eyes."
00:05:17.240,00:05:19.040,"Quick, let's hide."
00:05:22.880,00:05:25.080,"One, Two..."
00:05:25.080,00:05:32.640,"three, four, five, six, seven, eight..."
00:05:32.640,00:05:35.560,"nine, ten."
00:05:35.560,00:05:38.440,"Coming, ready or not."
00:05:38.440,00:05:41.360,Oh! Where are the twins?
00:05:41.360,00:05:43.640,Daisy! Poppy!
00:05:43.640,00:05:46.680,It's not safe for you to fly so high.
00:05:46.680,00:05:49.600,Kitty catty!
00:05:55.240,00:05:59.240,Wow! Fleur's turned into a kitten again.
00:05:59.240,00:06:06.480,"Run away, kitten Come back, Fleur So where are the twins?"
00:06:10.640,00:06:12.320,They've escaped.
00:06:12.320,00:06:15.920,"Uh, and they've sort of got my wand."
00:06:15.920,00:06:19.080,Goodness knows what damage they might do.
00:06:19.080,00:06:21.280,"Don't worry, we'll find them."
00:06:21.280,00:06:23.960,Elves are good at that sort of thing.
00:06:23.960,00:06:25.760,BOTH: And we're elves!
00:06:28.360,00:06:30.960,So how are you going to find them?
00:06:30.960,00:06:34.280,Easy.
00:06:36.040,00:06:39.000,"Gaston, find Daisy and Poppy."
00:06:49.200,00:06:51.760,My goodness.
00:06:51.760,00:06:54.880,You're a long way from home.
00:06:51.760,00:06:56.240,We'd better ring your mommy and daddy.
00:06:56.240,00:06:58.720,Bunny rabbit!
00:07:00.000,00:07:03.040,"Now, now, Daisy, that wasn't very nice."
00:07:03.040,00:07:05.680,Bunny rabbit!
00:07:06.880,00:07:09.280,What's going on?
00:07:09.280,00:07:11.640,DAISY: Bunny rabbit!
00:07:12.800,00:07:15.080,BOTH: More! More! More!
00:07:18.600,00:07:20.480,What's that noise?
00:07:20.480,00:07:24.040,It's coming from over there.
00:07:24.040,00:07:28.080,I think we've found my little sisters.
00:07:29.640,00:07:32.560,"BOTH: Hop, hop, hop!"
00:07:34.880,00:07:39.520,Whoa!
00:07:39.520,00:07:42.120,BEN: That one's wearing my dad's hat.
00:07:42.120,00:07:45.720,Poppy! Daisy!
00:07:45.720,00:07:47.800,"Rabbity, rabbity!"
00:07:47.800,00:07:51.560,They've turned all the elves into rabbits.
00:07:51.560,00:07:55.440,"Daisy, that wasn't funny or clever."
00:07:55.440,00:07:57.120,Give me the wand.
00:07:57.120,00:07:59.800,Kitty catty!
00:08:01.560,00:08:11.160,"Daisy and Poppy, I'm sure you didn't mean to-- Birdy, wirdy!"
00:08:11.160,00:08:14.280,"Birdy, wirdy!"
00:08:16.880,00:08:19.440,Phew!
00:08:19.440,00:08:23.040,BEN: Yes. Luckily birds can't hold wands.
00:08:27.760,00:08:31.080,Ah! Barnaby and Ben.
00:08:31.080,00:08:34.360,BARNABY: The kittens are Holly and Fleur.
00:08:34.360,00:08:37.280,BEN: And the birds are the twins.
00:08:37.280,00:08:38.680,What?
00:08:38.680,00:08:43.040,"Uh, Daisy and Poppy have been doing a bit of magicking."
00:08:44.400,00:08:46.200,And who are all the rabbits?
00:08:46.200,00:08:47.960,BARNABY: They're the elves.
00:08:47.960,00:08:52.440,Right! We've got a lot of tidying up to do.
00:08:52.440,00:09:10.000,"Run away, kittens Come back, fairies Hop away, bunnies Come back, elves Fly away, birdies Come back, twins Holly, you were supposed to be looking after your little sisters."
00:09:10.000,00:09:14.160,"But, Nanny, the twins are impossible."
00:09:14.160,00:09:16.520,They are a bit of a handful.
00:09:19.720,00:09:23.600,No harm done?
00:09:23.600,00:09:26.000,I know!
00:09:27.360,00:09:31.520,But-- But-- The little darlings are getting really good at magic.
00:09:31.520,00:09:34.480,BOTH: Froggy! Froggy!
00:09:35.720,00:09:38.080,I think I'll take those wands.
00:09:38.080,00:09:41.120,We won't be needing any more magic today.
00:09:41.120,00:09:42.320,But Nanny Plum.
00:09:42.320,00:09:45.280,We can't just leave her as a frog.
00:09:46.440,00:09:50.480,"Can't we? No, I suppose not."
00:09:50.480,00:09:54.560,"All right, Holly, magic her back again."
00:09:54.560,00:10:06.000,"Hop away, frog Come back, nanny QUEEN: Good night, my little ones."
00:10:06.000,00:10:07.520,Sleep well.
00:10:07.520,00:10:11.120,Ah! They're fast asleep already.
00:10:11.120,00:10:14.600,"Well, they have had a very busy day, Your Majesty."
00:10:14.600,00:10:18.760,"I expect playing with you big children really tired them out, Holly."
00:10:18.760,00:10:23.400,"Uh, yes, Mommy, something like that."
00:10:25.440,00:10:30.000,I wonder what sweet little dreams they're having?
00:10:30.000,00:10:33.880,"Tiger, tiger, alligator."
00:10:33.880,00:10:36.480,Crocodile.
00:10:38.120,00:10:44.800,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the little castle.
00:10:59.800,00:11:02.440,My new fairy tea set has arrived.
00:11:02.440,00:11:03.960,CHILDREN: Ooh!
00:11:07.120,00:11:12.760,Ooh! It's so beautiful and it's so sparkly.
00:11:12.760,00:11:14.920,"It's also very delicate, Holly."
00:11:14.920,00:11:16.960,That means it breaks easily.
00:11:16.960,00:11:19.720,"So you can look, but don't touch."
00:11:21.160,00:11:24.400,It is a beautiful teapot.
00:11:24.400,00:11:27.360,"Shall I give it a bit of a dust, Your Majesty?"
00:11:27.360,00:11:31.680,"No, Nanny Plum."
00:11:31.680,00:11:33.280,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:11:33.280,00:11:38.720,"Good. Now, as it's such a lovely day, why don't we go for a nice walk?"
00:11:38.720,00:11:41.920,Can I stay here and look at the tea set instead?
00:11:41.920,00:11:45.520,"All right, Holly, but look and don't touch."
00:11:45.520,00:11:47.000,"Yes, Mommy."
00:11:48.160,00:11:51.840,Ooh.
00:11:54.080,00:11:56.760,"Hello, Nanny Plum."
00:11:56.760,00:11:58.520,Can Holly come out to play?
00:11:58.520,00:12:03.760,"I'm afraid Princess Holly is very busy, looking at a teapot."
00:12:01.520,00:12:07.400,Perhaps if-- Ben! I've got something to show you!
00:12:07.400,00:12:08.880,"BEN: Okay, Holly!"
00:12:10.440,00:12:14.080,Look. Mommy's fairy tea set.
00:12:14.080,00:12:16.560,Isn't it beautiful?
00:12:16.560,00:12:18.640,"Uh, I suppose so."
00:12:18.640,00:12:24.280,"No one is allowed to touch it, not even Nanny."
00:12:24.280,00:12:29.040,Why not?
00:12:29.040,00:12:31.280,What can you do with it then?
00:12:31.280,00:12:36.360,"Well, you can have tea parties with it, of course."
00:12:36.360,00:12:42.200,"Uh, but we're not supposed to-- Just hold them, silly."
00:12:42.200,00:12:44.880,Look at me.
00:12:48.400,00:12:49.600,Weak or strong?
00:12:56.400,00:12:59.080,You've broken the Queen's teapot.
00:12:59.080,00:13:03.120,"Oh, no!"
00:13:03.120,00:13:06.320,"We weren't supposed to touch it, were we?"
00:13:06.320,00:13:09.840,No. What can we do?
00:13:09.840,00:13:12.040,Can you fix it with magic?
00:13:12.040,00:13:14.720,"Uh, I'll try."
00:13:14.720,00:13:18.120,Abracadabra Abraca doo...
00:13:18.120,00:13:19.280,Uh...
00:13:19.280,00:13:21.760,Mend this teapot?
00:13:25.640,00:13:27.480,"Well, that didn't work."
00:13:28.800,00:13:31.800,Nanny will know a spell.
00:13:31.800,00:13:34.320,No. We can't tell anyone.
00:13:34.320,00:13:35.920,What can we do then?
00:13:37.280,00:13:42.120,"Uh, Ben, aren't elves good at mending things?"
00:13:42.120,00:13:43.960,"Uh, yes."
00:13:43.960,00:13:45.840,And you're an elf.
00:13:45.840,00:13:47.120,Ben Elf!
00:13:48.960,00:13:51.960,So can you help me mend it?
00:13:51.960,00:13:54.400,Uh. I'm not sure.
00:13:54.400,00:13:56.400,"Please, Ben."
00:13:56.400,00:14:01.880,"You're my very best friend, and you're my only hope."
00:14:01.880,00:14:04.040,"Uh, okay."
00:14:04.040,00:14:06.920,I've got stuff for mending things at home.
00:14:08.120,00:14:11.080,We can carry the pieces in this box.
00:14:11.080,00:14:13.440,But what if someone sees us?
00:14:13.440,00:14:15.360,I can make us invisible.
00:14:15.360,00:14:18.760,I know that spell.
00:14:18.760,00:14:27.280,"Abraca dibbly dibble Make us invisible Hey, it worked. Come on."
00:14:33.480,00:14:35.680,BEN: Shh. There's Nanny.
00:14:35.680,00:14:38.440,Ben. Be quiet.
00:14:43.520,00:14:48.040,"Oh, bother, my invisible spell has worn off."
00:14:48.040,00:14:50.760,"That's all right, we're nearly there."
00:14:50.760,00:14:52.400,No one will see us now.
00:14:52.400,00:14:55.040,"Hello, Ben."
00:14:55.040,00:14:57.840,"Uh, hello, Mrs. Elf."
00:14:57.840,00:14:59.520,What are you two up to then?
00:14:59.520,00:15:01.040,"Uh, nothing, Mom."
00:15:01.040,00:15:03.680,We're just going to mend something.
00:15:03.680,00:15:06.800,Yes. Elves are good at mending things.
00:15:06.800,00:15:08.280,And you're an elf.
00:15:09.440,00:15:10.840,"Yes, Mom."
00:15:17.480,00:15:20.160,This is where I keep all my mending stuff.
00:15:21.400,00:15:28.160,"Glue, paint, brushes-- And glitter. Oh, goody."
00:15:28.160,00:15:33.440,"First, I have to put a mat down, so that we don't get glue on the floor."
00:15:33.440,00:15:34.680,Yes.
00:15:34.680,00:15:38.840,"And we must wear aprons, to keep our clothes clean."
00:15:40.040,00:15:41.520,Now what?
00:15:41.520,00:15:45.520,We stick the pieces together with glue.
00:15:45.520,00:15:53.720,"Like this: One, two, three."
00:15:53.720,00:15:55.760,"There, it's stuck."
00:15:57.240,00:16:00.040,"HOLLY: One, two, three."
00:16:01.280,00:16:04.760,"BEN: One, two, three."
00:16:06.040,00:16:08.560,"HOLLY: One, two, three."
00:16:09.960,00:16:14.920,"BEN: One, two, three."
00:16:14.920,00:16:17.120,BOTH: Hooray!
00:16:17.120,00:16:18.360,Hm.
00:16:18.360,00:16:20.600,It doesn't look quite right.
00:16:20.600,00:16:22.600,"Uh, we can paint it."
00:16:22.600,00:16:23.680,Yes.
00:16:28.720,00:16:30.120,That's better.
00:16:30.120,00:16:31.320,Hm.
00:16:31.320,00:16:34.040,It had flowers on it too.
00:16:34.040,00:16:37.240,I'm good at painting flowers.
00:16:37.240,00:16:38.760,There.
00:16:38.760,00:16:42.200,But I think it was a bit more sparkly.
00:16:42.200,00:16:44.200,We can use glitter.
00:16:45.720,00:16:48.160,HOLLY: I love glitter.
00:16:48.160,00:16:50.000,It's so glittery.
00:16:50.000,00:16:52.040,There.
00:16:52.040,00:16:54.880,BOTH: Hooray!
00:16:54.880,00:16:58.200,Do you think your mom might see the difference?
00:16:58.200,00:17:00.560,"Uh, yes."
00:17:00.560,00:17:04.040,Maybe it just needs more glitter?
00:17:04.040,00:17:05.680,"No, Ben."
00:17:05.680,00:17:09.440,"We tried to mend it, but it didn't work."
00:17:09.440,00:17:13.120,We'll just have to ask Nanny Plum for a spell.
00:17:13.120,00:17:16.640,"All right, let's go to Nanny."
00:17:21.480,00:17:22.880,There's Nanny.
00:17:22.880,00:17:25.720,Go on.
00:17:25.720,00:17:29.280,Nanny!
00:17:25.720,00:17:31.280,"Please can I ask you a question about spells, please?"
00:17:31.280,00:17:33.960,A question? Or course.
00:17:33.960,00:17:41.760,"Nanny, a little friend of mine has broken something and wants to mend it."
00:17:41.760,00:17:43.840,What spell can she use?
00:17:43.840,00:17:46.120,Do I know this little friend?
00:17:46.120,00:17:47.880,"Uh, no."
00:17:47.880,00:17:49.720,She's a goblin.
00:17:49.720,00:17:53.840,And she lives far away and you don't know her at all.
00:17:53.840,00:17:57.280,"Is it a special thing, this little goblin broke?"
00:17:57.280,00:17:58.720,Yes.
00:17:58.720,00:18:01.760,And did the little goblin break it on purpose?
00:18:01.760,00:18:03.440,No. It was an accident.
00:18:03.440,00:18:05.160,I didn't mean to break it.
00:18:05.160,00:18:07.000,"Aah! Oh, I see."
00:18:07.000,00:18:08.400,You broke it.
00:18:08.400,00:18:11.880,"Oh, Nanny, I didn't mean to break it."
00:18:11.880,00:18:14.520,"Oh, don't worry, Holly, it can't be that bad."
00:18:14.520,00:18:16.760,It is that bad.
00:18:16.760,00:18:19.160,Don't be silly.
00:18:16.760,00:18:21.400,It's not as if you've broken the Queen's teapot.
00:18:21.400,00:18:22.520,What did you break?
00:18:22.520,00:18:24.080,BOTH: The Queen's teapot.
00:18:24.080,00:18:25.440,Oh.
00:18:25.440,00:18:28.160,Mommy's going to be so sad.
00:18:28.160,00:18:30.120,But we did mend it.
00:18:30.120,00:18:32.600,Well.
00:18:32.600,00:18:36.880,It doesn't look exactly like it did before.
00:18:38.800,00:18:41.560,"Please, can you fix it, Nanny?"
00:18:41.560,00:18:44.480,"Don't worry, I know just what to do."
00:18:44.480,00:18:47.800,I knew Nanny Plum would have a spell to fix it.
00:18:47.800,00:18:49.560,I'm not going to fix it.
00:18:49.560,00:18:51.960,Are you going to buy a new teapot?
00:18:51.960,00:18:54.880,NANNY: No. Much simpler than that.
00:18:54.880,00:18:56.080,What?
00:18:56.080,00:18:57.840,We'll tell the Queen.
00:19:02.760,00:19:04.480,"Excuse me, Your Majesty?"
00:19:04.480,00:19:06.000,"What is it, Nanny Plum?"
00:19:06.000,00:19:10.160,"Unfortunately, there has been a little accident."
00:19:10.160,00:19:12.120,Accident? What happened?
00:19:12.120,00:19:16.720,I'm sorry to say that your teapot has been broken.
00:19:17.880,00:19:20.560,The teapot I said no one was to touch?
00:19:20.560,00:19:21.960,"Uh, yes."
00:19:21.960,00:19:25.840,"Nanny Plum, I told you not to dust that tea set."
00:19:25.840,00:19:27.440,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:19:27.440,00:19:31.000,I have a good mind to turn you into a slug.
00:19:31.000,00:19:33.200,"That's a bit harsh, isn't it, darling?"
00:19:33.200,00:19:36.400,"Could you turn me into a snail perhaps, instead?"
00:19:36.400,00:19:37.600,No.
00:19:37.600,00:19:39.600,"Mommy, it was me."
00:19:39.600,00:19:43.760,I did it.
00:19:43.760,00:19:47.840,"And now you're going to have to turn me into a slug, instead of Nanny."
00:19:49.040,00:19:52.720,"Oh. Oh, no, my poor darling."
00:19:52.720,00:19:54.000,Don't be sad.
00:19:54.000,00:19:56.080,It's only a silly piece of pottery.
00:19:56.080,00:20:00.320,"But, Mommy, you were going to turn Nanny into a slug."
00:20:00.320,00:20:03.000,Oh.
00:20:03.000,00:20:04.200,Huh?
00:20:04.200,00:20:06.840,"Sorry I made you sad, Mommy."
00:20:06.840,00:20:10.880,"Oh, Holly, I'm only sad that you felt you couldn't tell me."
00:20:10.880,00:20:13.200,We did try and mend it.
00:20:13.200,00:20:19.040,"It doesn't look like it did before, but the children have tried their hardest."
00:20:19.040,00:20:20.400,Oh!
00:20:20.400,00:20:22.880,That is beautiful.
00:20:22.880,00:20:25.160,Just as beautiful as it was before.
00:20:25.160,00:20:27.160,"Shall I give it a dust, Your Majesty?"
00:20:27.160,00:20:31.160,No! This is one of a kind and very fragile.
00:20:31.160,00:20:34.440,No one must touch it.
00:20:34.440,00:20:35.960,ALL: We promise.
00:20:35.960,00:20:39.280,I will treasure it forever.
00:00:01.480,00:00:10.160,"NARRATOR: Somewhere, hidden amongst thorny brambles, is a little kingdom of elves and fairies."
00:00:10.160,00:00:15.040,"Everyone who lives here is very, very small."
00:00:15.040,00:00:17.160,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:18.440,00:00:21.000,And I'm Princess Holly.

00:00:24.320,00:00:26.440,Wait for us.
00:00:35.720,00:00:42.720,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:00:49.200,00:00:53.480,Ah! What a lovely day for a royal fairy picnic.
00:00:53.480,00:00:56.880,"Nanny Plum, get the magic picnic basket ready!"
00:00:56.880,00:01:00.160,"Uh, I can't, Your Majesty."
00:01:00.160,00:01:03.200,The magic picnic basket has disappeared.
00:01:03.200,00:01:05.120,"You mean, you lost it."
00:01:05.120,00:01:07.680,Things don't just disappear.
00:01:07.680,00:01:11.800,Whoa.
00:01:11.800,00:01:16.240,Nanny.
00:01:21.520,00:01:26.280,There. One piano to deliver to the King.
00:01:26.280,00:01:30.760,Ben. Are you ready?
00:01:32.640,00:01:34.480,"Come on, Ben."
00:01:34.480,00:01:36.840,We've got this piano to deliver to the Little Castle.
00:01:36.840,00:01:38.320,I don't want to be late.
00:01:38.320,00:01:41.080,"That's right, Ben."
00:01:41.080,00:01:43.880,ALL: And we're elves.
00:01:45.080,00:01:46.400,Oh. Where's my horn?
00:01:46.400,00:01:49.320,"Ben, you must look after your things."
00:01:49.320,00:01:53.120,A good elf never loses their things.
00:01:53.120,00:01:55.880,"Oh, where's my piano gone?"
00:01:55.880,00:01:57.400,What's happening?
00:01:57.400,00:02:00.360,Aah! Ants.
00:02:05.040,00:02:07.120,Oi. That's our TV.
00:02:07.120,00:02:09.800,Why are the ants taking all our stuff?
00:02:09.800,00:02:11.920,I don't know.
00:02:11.920,00:02:16.440,Ants! Outrageous!
00:02:16.440,00:02:19.120,"Nanny Plum, do something!"
00:02:19.120,00:02:22.480,"Okay, let's follow them."
00:02:22.480,00:02:25.440,Where are the ants taking our things?
00:02:25.440,00:02:28.000,Probably to the queen ant.
00:02:28.000,00:02:29.400,Queen ant.
00:02:29.400,00:02:32.280,Is she pretty like Mommy?
00:02:32.280,00:02:35.640,Does she have lovely dresses and a sparkly crown?
00:02:35.640,00:02:39.760,"No, the queen ant is a different sort of queen."
00:02:39.760,00:02:41.360,Oh.
00:02:51.720,00:02:54.400,There's my horn.
00:02:54.400,00:02:57.400,There's my wand.
00:02:58.320,00:03:02.760,Oi. That's our TV.
00:03:05.520,00:03:07.400,Yes. And ours too.
00:03:07.400,00:03:09.320,Where are they taking it?
00:03:09.320,00:03:11.240,Down to the queen ant.
00:03:11.240,00:03:15.800,"Nanny, I command you to have a word with this queen ant."
00:03:15.800,00:03:17.600,"What word would that be, Your Majesty?"
00:03:17.600,00:03:21.720,Uh...tell her to stop taking our stuff.
00:03:21.720,00:03:26.840,"I would, Your Majesty, but I can't speak Ant."
00:03:26.840,00:03:31.960,"It's one of the more difficult insect languages, along with Centipede."
00:03:31.960,00:03:35.080,What we need is someone who can speak Ant.
00:03:35.080,00:03:37.760,BEN &amp; HOLLY: Gaston.
00:03:37.760,00:03:41.760,"Ah, good."
00:03:44.200,00:03:47.040,So Gaston can be your ant translator.
00:03:48.400,00:03:49.600,"Down you go, Nanny."
00:03:49.600,00:03:52.440,Can Ben and I go too?
00:03:52.440,00:03:55.960,But stay close to Nanny Plum so she can keep you safe.
00:03:55.960,00:03:57.240,BOTH: Hooray.
00:03:57.240,00:03:59.920,"I'll go too, to keep Nanny Plum safe."
00:03:59.920,00:04:03.960,"And I'll go too, to keep Mr. Elf safe."
00:04:05.520,00:04:10.320,"Hm. These tunnels could go very deep, you know."
00:04:10.320,00:04:12.200,How deep?
00:04:12.200,00:04:15.040,Do they go to the center of the Earth?
00:04:15.040,00:04:19.720,"I hope not, my feet are tired enough already."
00:04:19.720,00:04:22.560,ALL: Ooh.
00:04:22.560,00:04:24.720,This way.
00:04:28.160,00:04:31.480,MRS. ELF: It would be very easy to get lost in these tunnels.
00:04:31.480,00:04:33.000,BEN: It's a maze.
00:04:36.520,00:04:40.280,Don't worry. I know how to get through mazes.
00:04:40.280,00:04:49.680,"You take every first turning down and every third turning up, and that gets you through any maze."
00:04:49.680,00:04:51.680,Oh. It's a dead end.
00:04:51.680,00:04:55.520,Or is it every second turn to the left?
00:04:55.520,00:04:58.600,"Ooh, are we lost, Mr. Elf?"
00:05:00.040,00:05:02.080,What's that sound?
00:05:02.080,00:05:04.240,Ahh! Ants.
00:05:05.600,00:05:06.840,That's lucky.
00:05:06.840,00:05:09.360,They can show us where the queen ant is.
00:05:09.360,00:05:13.480,"Gaston, say Take us to your leader."
00:05:16.600,00:05:18.960,What did they say?
00:05:18.960,00:05:22.080,Gaston says the ants will give us a lift.
00:05:22.080,00:05:23.280,BOTH: Cool.
00:05:23.280,00:05:26.840,Yee-haw.
00:05:26.840,00:05:30.000,BEN &amp; HOLLY: Whee!
00:05:31.520,00:05:33.600,ALL: Whoa!
00:05:34.840,00:05:36.960,Ah! My tummy!
00:05:36.960,00:05:39.600,This is fun!
00:05:39.600,00:05:42.080,NANNY: Whoa!
00:05:46.240,00:05:48.760,This must be where the queen ant lives.
00:05:48.760,00:05:50.120,BEN &amp; HOLLY: Ooh.
00:05:51.520,00:05:54.200,Oh. Is that the queen?
00:05:54.200,00:05:56.640,Uh...yes.
00:05:56.640,00:06:00.240,"She's, um, big, isn't she?"
00:06:00.240,00:06:01.600,Hm.
00:06:01.600,00:06:04.480,"Gaston, can you translate for us please?"
00:06:05.720,00:06:11.080,"Greetings, your ant-ness."
00:06:11.080,00:06:15.360,And I'm Holly.
00:06:15.360,00:06:18.800,I'm Mr. Elf.
00:06:18.800,00:06:20.840,And I'm Ben Elf.
00:06:26.680,00:06:28.200,And you've got my horn.
00:06:28.200,00:06:30.680,HOLLY: And there's my wand.
00:06:30.680,00:06:32.480,MR. ELF: There's the King's piano.
00:06:32.480,00:06:33.840,MRS. ELF: And our TV.
00:06:33.840,00:06:36.280,NANNY: And my magic picnic basket.
00:06:36.280,00:06:40.160,"Gaston, ask if we can have our stuff back."
00:06:44.520,00:06:46.920,I think that means no.
00:06:46.920,00:06:50.160,"Why won't she let us have our stuff back, Nanny?"
00:06:50.160,00:06:52.400,"Ugh, goodness knows."
00:06:52.400,00:06:56.440,What do you want all this stuff for?
00:07:00.720,00:07:04.560,"She says it's for eating, even though it tastes horrible."
00:07:04.560,00:07:08.600,Why is she eating it if it tastes horrible?
00:07:08.600,00:07:11.240,"This isn't food, you know."
00:07:13.760,00:07:19.080,Queen ant says they used to collect food left over from big people's picnics.
00:07:20.520,00:07:25.520,But the big people haven't had a picnic for ages.
00:07:25.520,00:07:29.840,So the ants have to eat any old rubbish they can find.
00:07:32.320,00:07:34.040,That's not rubbish.
00:07:34.040,00:07:36.640,It's a fine musical instrument.
00:07:36.640,00:07:38.520,I'm delivering it to the King.
00:07:38.520,00:07:41.640,It's not good to eat musical instruments.
00:07:41.640,00:07:45.560,"Yes, Ben, she's obviously very stupid."
00:07:46.760,00:07:50.520,Gaston.
00:07:50.520,00:07:56.680,"Uh, when I said you are very stupid, I meant you are very clever."
00:07:58.080,00:08:01.320,"Uh, she doesn't seem very pleased."
00:08:01.320,00:08:06.440,"If you want food, I can make some with my magic picnic basket."
00:08:07.480,00:08:09.800,What would you like to eat?
00:08:11.840,00:08:13.800,She likes sweet things.
00:08:13.800,00:08:16.360,What kind of sweet things?
00:08:18.240,00:08:21.040,Jelly.
00:08:21.040,00:08:24.200,"Careful, Nanny Plum."
00:08:24.200,00:08:27.280,"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing."
00:08:28.480,00:08:40.720,Magic basket please Jelly jelly But not a lot Do you want more?
00:08:40.720,00:08:42.520,No problem.
00:08:42.520,00:08:43.800,"Careful, Nanny Plum."
00:08:43.800,00:08:47.240,"Oh, Mr. Elf, stop fussing."
00:08:47.240,00:09:00.640,"Jelly, Jelly A little bit more HOLLY: Nanny, they all want jelly."
00:09:00.640,00:09:03.560,"Goodness me, we'll be here all day."
00:09:03.560,00:09:06.120,I'll just have to make a lot more.
00:09:06.120,00:09:07.760,"ALL: No, Nanny Plum."
00:09:07.760,00:09:10.240,More. More. More.
00:09:14.200,00:09:18.040,"ALL: Whoa, jelly flood."
00:09:27.280,00:09:30.360,Jelly flood! Aah!
00:09:31.520,00:09:34.240,I can hear something.
00:09:34.240,00:09:35.960,ALL: Jelly flood!
00:09:35.960,00:09:38.760,What are they shouting?

00:09:57.840,00:10:00.280,I've got my wand back.
00:10:00.280,00:10:03.360,And the ants have got all the jelly they can eat.
00:10:07.480,00:10:10.520,The piano's taken a bit of a bashing.
00:10:10.520,00:10:14.080,"Heh, I'm glad that's not my piano."
00:10:14.080,00:10:17.040,"Actually, Your Majesty, it is your piano."
00:10:17.040,00:10:19.320,I was just delivering it to you.
00:10:19.320,00:10:21.080,Oh.
00:10:22.640,00:10:26.840,"It's okay, Daddy, it sounds lovely."
00:10:26.840,00:10:30.120,As long as you only play tunes with high notes.
00:10:49.720,00:10:52.360,"Hello, Holly."
00:10:52.360,00:10:54.400,"Hi, Barnaby."

00:10:57.280,00:10:58.480,What's that?
00:10:58.480,00:11:02.600,My Uncle Redbeard is returning from the sea today.
00:11:02.600,00:11:04.720,He's an elf pirate.
00:11:04.720,00:11:07.200,Wow. A pirate.
00:11:07.200,00:11:09.160,We're going to meet him at the river.
00:11:09.160,00:11:10.720,"Do you want to come along, Holly?"
00:11:10.720,00:11:14.640,"Nanny Plum, can we go and meet the elf pirate?"
00:11:14.640,00:11:16.200,Why not?
00:11:17.320,00:11:20.000,"Hi, Dad."
00:11:20.000,00:11:21.760,Is Uncle Redbeard here?

00:11:54.640,00:11:56.440,"Ooh, ha, ha."
00:11:56.440,00:12:00.280,For I am Redbeard.
00:12:01.720,00:12:04.560,"Hello, Fred."
00:12:04.560,00:12:09.080,"Uncle, what was it like, being a pirate on the sea?"
00:12:09.080,00:12:13.000,It were a strange life for an elf.
00:12:13.000,00:12:16.640,"Long days staring at the sea, looking for boats."
00:12:16.640,00:12:20.840,"No one to keep me company, except Polly."
00:12:20.840,00:12:24.760,Polly?
00:12:24.760,00:12:27.960,This is Polly.
00:12:27.960,00:12:29.800,ALL: Ooh.
00:12:29.800,00:12:31.400,Pieces of eight.
00:12:31.400,00:12:36.680,She alone was my companion as we sailed through the endless waters.
00:12:36.680,00:12:38.120,Pieces of eight.
00:12:38.120,00:12:40.640,The conversation must have been riveting.
00:12:40.640,00:12:43.120,Pieces of eight.
00:12:43.120,00:12:47.480,"Uh, were you an evil, nasty, bad pirate?"
00:12:47.480,00:12:49.680,"Well, no."
00:12:49.680,00:12:55.360,"The thing is, it's quite hard to be a pirate when you're as small as an elf."
00:12:55.360,00:12:57.880,All the other boats are so big.
00:13:00.520,00:13:04.240,So you didn't do any piratey things at all?
00:13:04.240,00:13:05.720,Of course I did.
00:13:05.720,00:13:08.760,What would any self-respecting pirate be without...
00:13:08.760,00:13:10.400,treasure.
00:13:10.400,00:13:12.240,ALL: Ooh. Heh.
00:13:12.240,00:13:15.880,And here's me treasure map.
00:13:15.880,00:13:17.280,ALL: Wow.
00:13:17.280,00:13:18.640,Now then.
00:13:18.640,00:13:21.080,Somewhere on this map is the hidden treasure.
00:13:21.080,00:13:23.920,BEN: It's a map of the Little Kingdom.
00:13:23.920,00:13:26.320,"Aye. But that's just the start, me shipmates."
00:13:26.320,00:13:29.080,"There'll be a big search, with lots of clues."
00:13:29.080,00:13:32.360,There's no need for a big search and a lot of old fuss.
00:13:32.360,00:13:35.080,I can magic you some treasure right here.
00:13:35.080,00:13:39.120,Abracadabra ALL: Ooh.
00:13:39.120,00:13:41.120,No. That's cheating.
00:13:41.120,00:13:46.120,"Yes, that's true, Nanny Plum."
00:13:46.120,00:13:47.400,All right.
00:13:47.400,00:13:49.840,Just trying to save a bit of time.
00:13:51.600,00:13:55.000,Hm. There's an X in the meadow.
00:13:55.000,00:13:57.120,Is that where the treasure is?
00:13:57.120,00:13:58.840,There's only one way to find out.
00:13:58.840,00:14:01.280,To the meadow.
00:14:01.280,00:14:03.400,We may need a spade.
00:14:03.400,00:14:07.600,Pirate treasure is often buried in the ground.
00:14:07.600,00:14:09.320,KIDS: Ooh.
00:14:11.680,00:14:13.840,It's Fleur and Strawberry.
00:14:13.840,00:14:15.200,"BOTH: Hello, everyone."
00:14:15.200,00:14:16.840,"Hello, me hearties."
00:14:16.840,00:14:23.040,"I'm Redbeard the elf pirate, and this is me friend Polly."
00:14:23.040,00:14:24.600,Pieces of eight.
00:14:24.600,00:14:26.000,BOTH: Ooh.
00:14:26.000,00:14:28.280,We're looking for hidden treasure.
00:14:28.280,00:14:29.800,BOTH: Wow.
00:14:29.800,00:14:31.160,Ah-ha.
00:14:31.160,00:14:33.120,There's a riddle on the back of the map.
00:14:33.120,00:14:34.800,What does it say?
00:14:34.800,00:14:43.160,"Roses are large, the sky is big, mix them together, and you'll know where to dig."
00:14:43.160,00:14:46.920,Oh.
00:14:46.920,00:14:50.720,Roses are large...
00:14:50.720,00:14:52.760,NANNY: But how do you mix them together?
00:14:52.760,00:14:55.600,It can't be done.
00:14:55.600,00:14:58.560,"That's why it's a riddle, me lovely."
00:14:59.720,00:15:01.600,It's a puzzle you have to solve.
00:15:01.600,00:15:05.880,The roses are red...
00:15:05.880,00:15:08.560,"Mix them together, and you get..."
00:15:08.560,00:15:09.840,Purple.
00:15:09.840,00:15:13.720,It must be buried under the purple flower.
00:15:13.720,00:15:17.440,Ah-ha. Very good.
00:15:17.440,00:15:20.560,"Come on, Ben, let's dig for the treasure."
00:15:20.560,00:15:23.960,Yes.
00:15:23.960,00:15:27.120,BOTH: And we're elves.
00:15:37.680,00:15:39.800,Oh. What's that?
00:15:39.800,00:15:41.560,It's another map.
00:15:41.560,00:15:43.200,That's right.
00:15:43.200,00:15:46.600,Ye can't just find the treasure with one clue.
00:15:46.600,00:15:47.960,Why not?
00:15:47.960,00:15:51.120,"That wouldn't be fun, me little mermaid."
00:15:56.640,00:15:59.160,HOLLY: Let's go there.
00:16:01.880,00:16:04.640,"Hello, Gaston."
00:16:04.640,00:16:10.120,We think there might be some pirate treasure in your cave.
00:16:11.520,00:16:20.440,"Ah. I used to live here meself, many moons ago, probably before you were even born, Gaston."
00:16:20.440,00:16:22.920,"I like what you've done with the place, Gaston."
00:16:25.880,00:16:29.640,Mr. Redbeard?
00:16:29.640,00:16:31.560,"Aye, the riddle."
00:16:31.560,00:16:39.560,"I'm easily spotted, and where I lay, you'll find the clue, to show you the way."
00:16:39.560,00:16:42.960,Easily spotted?
00:16:44.160,00:16:47.080,Gaston has spots on his back.
00:16:47.080,00:16:51.720,And Gaston's bed is where he lays.
00:16:53.960,00:16:56.960,BEN: Its another map.
00:16:56.960,00:16:59.840,The X shows the Little Castle.
00:16:59.840,00:17:01.240,NANNY: Impossible.
00:17:01.240,00:17:05.760,I've dusted every nook and cranny of the Little Castle.
00:17:05.760,00:17:08.680,"Maybe it's well-hidden, me sweetheart."
00:17:08.680,00:17:09.960,Hm.
00:17:09.960,00:17:12.400,To the Little Castle.
00:17:16.080,00:17:19.040,"Hello, everybody."
00:17:19.040,00:17:20.760,Goodness me.
00:17:20.760,00:17:24.520,"Daddy, we're searching for pirate treasure."
00:17:24.520,00:17:28.320,"My Uncle is Redbeard, the elf pirate."
00:17:28.320,00:17:30.280,Your majesties.
00:17:30.280,00:17:32.000,"A pirate, eh?"
00:17:32.000,00:17:35.920,"Not a nasty pirate, Your Majesty, a good pirate."
00:17:35.920,00:17:39.800,"For I am Redbeard, the elf pirate."
00:17:41.560,00:17:43.640,"Well, that's all right then."
00:17:43.640,00:17:46.760,So where's this treasure?
00:17:46.760,00:17:55.440,"Up above the castle, I point to the sky, and hidden underneath me, is where the clue lies."
00:17:55.440,00:17:58.480,"Well, that's just nonsense."
00:17:58.480,00:18:00.680,The roof is above the castle.
00:18:00.680,00:18:02.760,KING: And it points to the sky.
00:18:02.760,00:18:05.320,"REDBEARD: Very clever, your majesties."
00:18:05.320,00:18:07.280,But that's ridiculous.
00:18:07.280,00:18:10.040,I've dusted on top of the roof a hundred times.
00:18:10.040,00:18:14.720,Maybe it be under the roof.
00:18:14.720,00:18:18.640,"Take a look under the roof, Nanny Plum."
00:18:18.640,00:18:21.280,"Oh. Are you sure, Your Majesty?"
00:18:21.280,00:18:23.000,I command it.
00:18:24.200,00:18:26.520,As you wish.
00:18:26.520,00:18:37.440,Zip zap zup Roof lift up Oh. I meant take a look through the attic door.
00:18:37.440,00:18:40.000,Oh.
00:18:40.000,00:18:43.440,Ooh.
00:18:43.440,00:18:46.640,KING: The X is at the river.
00:18:51.960,00:18:54.840,BEN: Oh. We're back where we started.
00:18:54.840,00:18:56.760,Where is the treasure?
00:18:59.600,00:19:03.240,Ahem.
00:18:59.600,00:19:07.360,"Up and down and side to side, it's inside this thing, I really hide."
00:19:07.360,00:19:09.560,The ship goes up and down.
00:19:09.560,00:19:11.680,STRAWBERRY: And it goes side to side.
00:19:11.680,00:19:13.880,ALL: Yes. The ship.
00:19:13.880,00:19:16.600,So that's where the treasure is.
00:19:16.600,00:19:20.200,That's right.
00:19:23.360,00:19:25.320,ALL: Ah.
00:19:25.320,00:19:28.520,Thanks for your help in finding me treasure.
00:19:28.520,00:19:30.720,But we're back where we started.
00:19:30.720,00:19:33.720,And the treasure was here all the time.
00:19:33.720,00:19:38.400,But didn't we have fun?
00:19:38.400,00:19:42.040,I certainly enjoyed it.
00:19:42.040,00:19:46.080,Fun is what it's all about when you're an elf pirate.
00:19:46.080,00:19:48.760,And I'm an elf pirate.
00:19:56.080,00:19:58.520,"Goodbye, Uncle Redbeard."
00:19:58.520,00:20:00.200,"Goodbye, Barnaby."
00:20:00.200,00:20:03.160,"Goodbye, everyone."
00:20:04.720,00:20:09.240,"Hoist the mainsail, Polly."
00:20:09.240,00:20:11.760,Squawk. Pieces of eight.
00:20:17.320,00:20:21.280,Heh. When I grow up I want to be a pirate.
00:20:21.280,00:20:23.400,A-hargh.
00:20:23.400,00:20:24.600,And me.
00:20:24.600,00:20:26.320,BOTH: And me.
00:20:27.480,00:20:29.800,You'll be seeing me again.
00:20:29.800,00:20:35.840,"Don't forget the name Redbeard, the elf pirate!"
00:20:37.000,00:20:39.320,Pieces of eight.
00:00:15.240,00:00:16.760,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:18.240,00:00:21.160,And I'm Princess Holly.
00:00:24.320,00:00:26.560,Wait for us.
00:00:36.680,00:00:44.000,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:00:49.040,00:00:50.760,"Hi, Ben."
00:00:50.760,00:00:52.560,Are you ready to come camping?
00:00:52.560,00:00:54.160,"Yes, please."
00:00:54.160,00:00:56.800,"Um, why have you brought an orange?"
00:00:56.800,00:00:59.080,It's to scare off gnomes.
00:00:59.080,00:01:03.520,"You know what they say, to scare off a gnome, bring an orange from home."
00:01:03.520,00:01:05.240,What's wrong with gnomes?
00:01:05.240,00:01:07.920,"Oh, you don't want to bring a gnome on a camping trip."
00:01:07.920,00:01:10.920,They talk and talk and talk and talk.
00:01:10.920,00:01:13.680,"Yes, gnomes are just like elves."
00:01:13.680,00:01:15.120,Absolutely not.
00:01:21.920,00:01:23.360,We really should be going.
00:01:23.360,00:01:26.160,"Bye, Mommy and Daddy."
00:01:26.160,00:01:27.440,Goodbye.
00:01:27.440,00:01:28.640,KING: Have fun.
00:01:28.640,00:01:30.440,NANNY: Watch out for those gnomes!
00:01:30.440,00:01:34.680,MRS. ELF: Don't worry!
00:01:36.040,00:01:37.440,Here's the timetable.
00:01:37.440,00:01:38.880,"One, set up camp."
00:01:38.880,00:01:40.680,"Two, hang up washing."
00:01:40.680,00:01:42.000,"Three, make a campfire."
00:01:42.000,00:01:45.320,"Four-- Dad, we're on holiday."
00:01:45.320,00:01:47.400,"Try to relax, Mr. Elf."
00:01:49.960,00:01:51.200,Here we are.
00:01:51.200,00:01:53.040,BEN &amp; HOLLY: Yipedee doo-dah!
00:01:53.040,00:01:55.760,Will there be any dancing?
00:01:55.760,00:01:57.320,Can we sing songs?
00:01:57.320,00:01:59.880,There will be no dancing or singing.
00:01:59.880,00:02:01.280,Just camping.
00:02:01.280,00:02:02.760,Here's the tent.
00:02:02.760,00:02:06.160,"Shall I magic the tent up for us, Mr. Elf?"
00:02:06.160,00:02:08.920,"Holly, I'd rather you didn't do any magicking."
00:02:08.920,00:02:11.360,"Remember, this is an elf camp."
00:02:11.360,00:02:14.720,Elves have been camping for hundreds of years.
00:02:14.720,00:02:17.760,We can put tents up with our eyes closed.
00:02:19.800,00:02:21.040,Wow!
00:02:23.040,00:02:24.240,Hooray!
00:02:24.240,00:02:26.720,Lovely.
00:02:26.720,00:02:30.360,Yes. And that means there's holiday work to be done.
00:02:30.360,00:02:31.760,Holiday work?
00:02:31.760,00:02:33.880,"Next on the list, hang out the washing."
00:02:33.880,00:02:35.960,But we've only just arrived.
00:02:35.960,00:02:38.240,Why do you need to hang out the washing?
00:02:38.240,00:02:41.920,A campsite can never be too clean and tidy.
00:02:41.920,00:02:45.280,I'll slice the orange.
00:02:45.280,00:02:48.880,"Mrs. Elf, how do oranges keep gnomes away?"
00:02:48.880,00:02:50.160,It's the smell.
00:02:50.160,00:02:52.680,Gnomes hate the smell of oranges.
00:02:52.680,00:02:53.920,Oh.
00:02:53.920,00:02:57.320,There. Now we're safe.
00:02:57.320,00:03:00.800,"Next on the list, collect sticks for the campfire."
00:03:01.960,00:03:03.920,Here are some sticks.
00:03:03.920,00:03:06.360,Here are some more.
00:03:07.320,00:03:09.560,"Okay, that's enough sticks."
00:03:12.760,00:03:14.800,Hello there.
00:03:14.800,00:03:16.800,A gnome!
00:03:16.800,00:03:18.600,Mind if I join you?
00:03:18.600,00:03:20.040,"Uh, well..."
00:03:20.040,00:03:21.360,Thank you.
00:03:21.360,00:03:23.680,I'll only stay for a week or two.
00:03:23.680,00:03:25.080,"Oh, no."
00:03:25.080,00:03:27.160,But we had an orange.
00:03:27.160,00:03:29.680,Yes.
00:03:32.800,00:03:34.840,But gnomes hate oranges.
00:03:34.840,00:03:36.920,"Normally, yes."
00:03:36.920,00:03:40.240,"But I'm on a balanced diet, you see."
00:03:40.240,00:03:49.360,"If I eat 10 pies and 20 steamed puddings, I need to balance that by eating fruit."
00:03:49.360,00:03:51.880,Let's make a fire.
00:03:51.880,00:03:54.280,"How do you make a fire, Mr. Elf?"
00:03:54.280,00:03:56.840,Rub two sticks together really fast.
00:03:56.840,00:04:04.320,Like this: You have to rub the sticks a little bit faster.
00:04:06.800,00:04:13.480,Would you like to hear the interesting thing I know about sticks?
00:04:13.480,00:04:17.000,Sticks grow on trees.
00:04:17.000,00:04:18.840,"Amazing, isn't it?"
00:04:21.280,00:04:24.080,BOTH: Ooh.
00:04:24.080,00:04:26.240,I'm nice and warm now.
00:04:26.240,00:04:29.600,That's because fire is hot.
00:04:31.320,00:04:33.960,I'm hungry.
00:04:33.960,00:04:35.360,What a surprise.
00:04:35.360,00:04:37.800,I've hardly eaten anything today.
00:04:37.800,00:04:43.880,"I've only had 10 pies, a skipful of chips, 30 apple tarts..."
00:04:43.880,00:04:45.640,Wow! That's a lot.
00:04:45.640,00:04:51.240,"...a sponge cake, a hundred sausages, and that orange."
00:04:51.240,00:04:54.000,I thought you said you were on a diet?
00:04:54.000,00:04:55.400,"Ho, ho, I am."
00:04:55.400,00:04:57.880,There are some things I don't eat.
00:04:57.880,00:05:02.160,"Like stones, wood and television sets."
00:05:02.160,00:05:05.440,But nobody eats those things.
00:05:05.440,00:05:07.360,"What, you're on this diet too?"
00:05:07.360,00:05:10.000,I never knew it was so popular.
00:05:10.000,00:05:12.720,"What's for dinner, Mrs. Elf?"
00:05:12.720,00:05:15.040,Cheese and onion pie.
00:05:15.040,00:05:18.000,"Ooh, thank you very muchly."
00:05:20.200,00:05:23.600,That's tasty.
00:05:23.600,00:05:26.480,"Ho, ho! Very good."
00:05:26.480,00:05:28.400,What's that?
00:05:31.520,00:05:33.800,It's an owl.
00:05:33.800,00:05:36.640,It's got very big eyes.
00:05:36.640,00:05:42.440,Would you like me to tell you an amazing fact about owls?
00:05:42.440,00:05:43.720,Um...
00:05:43.720,00:05:45.600,GNOME: I'll take that as a yes.
00:05:45.600,00:05:49.760,The owl is in fact a bird.
00:05:49.760,00:05:53.560,It has big eyes for seeing things.
00:05:53.560,00:05:56.000,6:00. Time for bed.
00:05:56.000,00:05:57.320,BOTH: Oh.
00:05:57.320,00:05:58.720,I'll put the fire out.
00:05:58.720,00:06:02.280,Can't you leave it to keep the owl warm?
00:06:02.280,00:06:05.720,"It's dangerous to leave a fire going, Princess Holly."
00:06:07.120,00:06:08.680,That's right.
00:06:17.880,00:06:20.360,That's silly.
00:06:20.360,00:06:23.280,"Ben, Holly, you get in the tent and go to sleep."
00:06:23.280,00:06:26.320,"Mr. Gnome, you have to go home."
00:06:26.320,00:06:28.280,But we're having fun.
00:06:28.280,00:06:30.840,Elf camping is not meant to be fun.
00:06:30.840,00:06:34.360,"Bedtime is at 6:00, not the middle of the night."
00:06:34.360,00:06:38.520,"Ho, ho. I know a song about the middle of the night."
00:06:38.520,00:06:40.080,Would you like to hear it?
00:06:40.080,00:06:41.360,BOTH: No!
00:06:41.360,00:06:44.320,I'll take that as a yes.
00:06:59.760,00:07:01.920,Altogether now.
00:07:01.920,00:07:12.320,ALL: Time for bed.
00:07:12.320,00:07:17.680,"It was lovely meeting you, Mr. Gnome, but now we need to get some sleep."
00:07:19.080,00:07:24.720,"Oh, yes. A good night's sleep is very important."
00:07:33.720,00:07:36.080,MR. ELF: Stop!
00:07:36.080,00:07:37.800,Stop!
00:07:37.800,00:07:39.360,Would you like me to stop?
00:07:39.360,00:07:42.560,Yes. And please go.
00:07:42.560,00:07:44.360,Would you like me to go?
00:07:44.360,00:07:48.440,Yes! Goodbye.
00:07:48.440,00:07:50.240,"Ho, ho! Sleep well."
00:07:50.240,00:07:52.120,See you in the morning.
00:07:52.120,00:07:54.400,"Ha, ha."
00:07:54.400,00:07:55.800,He is silly.
00:07:55.800,00:07:57.960,"Yes, really silly."
00:07:57.960,00:08:00.280,"Good night, everyone."
00:08:00.280,00:08:01.960,Good night.
00:08:10.000,00:08:11.880,Ah. It's the gnome.
00:08:11.880,00:08:14.160,He's come back to eat our breakfast.
00:08:15.320,00:08:17.440,Aah! A mole.
00:08:18.720,00:08:21.400,Aah!
00:08:21.400,00:08:25.840,Shoo! Shoo!
00:08:25.840,00:08:29.520,"Princess Holly, do you know a magic spell to get rid of moles?"
00:08:29.520,00:08:32.160,"I'm sorry, Mr. Elf, I don't."
00:08:32.160,00:08:34.320,"Oh, dear. Think, Mr. Elf."
00:08:34.320,00:08:36.240,What gets rid of moles?
00:08:36.240,00:08:37.440,Hello.
00:08:39.640,00:08:41.040,ALL: Hooray!
00:08:41.040,00:08:44.960,Yes.
00:08:44.960,00:08:46.960,No idea why.
00:08:46.960,00:08:52.000,"Uh, thank you, Mr. Gnome, for, uh, saving our campsite from the mole."
00:08:52.000,00:08:55.240,That's all right.
00:08:55.240,00:08:57.360,The mole ate all the food.
00:08:57.360,00:08:58.760,"Oh, dear."
00:08:58.760,00:08:59.880,Good morning.
00:08:59.880,00:09:01.320,Nanny Plum!
00:09:01.320,00:09:02.800,How was your night?
00:09:02.800,00:09:04.320,It was very strange.
00:09:04.320,00:09:08.520,"Mr. Gnome turned up, and he loves oranges."
00:09:08.520,00:09:13.240,And Mr. Gnome sang a funny song called Rinky Dinky Doo.
00:09:13.240,00:09:18.000,Then a mole came along and ate our washing line and all our food.
00:09:18.000,00:09:20.960,And now we haven't any breakfast.
00:09:23.600,00:09:26.720,That's why I've brought the magic picnic basket.
00:09:26.720,00:09:29.480,Breakfast for everyone!
00:09:29.480,00:09:31.080,ALL: Hooray!
00:09:31.080,00:09:33.880,"Oh, I'm actually very hungry."
00:09:35.960,00:09:38.360,Not today.
00:09:41.440,00:09:42.920,It isn't empty.
00:09:42.920,00:09:46.480,It's a magic picnic basket.
00:09:46.480,00:09:54.800,"Magic basket, please Breakfast for everyone ALL: Hooray!"
00:09:54.800,00:09:56.560,I get the idea.
00:09:56.560,00:10:11.320,"Magic basket, please Twenty poached eggs Lots of toast Nine jars of jam Forty sausages And 90 pancakes ALL: Yippee!"
00:10:11.320,00:10:13.720,What a splendid breakfast.
00:10:13.720,00:10:15.560,"Thank you, Mr. Gnome."
00:10:15.560,00:10:20.040,Breakfast is one of the things gnomes know a lot about.
00:10:21.160,00:10:24.000,"Mm. Yummy, yummy."
00:10:24.000,00:10:27.600,Oh. I almost forgot my balanced diet.
00:10:27.600,00:10:34.320,I shouldn't be eating all this without also eating an orange.
00:10:39.040,00:10:46.400,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:10:50.680,00:10:56.080,"Nanny Plum, your pie mash and chips is delicious."
00:10:56.080,00:10:58.840,What's for pudding?
00:10:58.840,00:11:03.240,Treacle sponge pudding with blancmange and custard.
00:11:03.240,00:11:05.320,ALL: Hooray!
00:11:05.320,00:11:08.840,Nanny Plum is the best cook in the Little Kingdom.
00:11:08.840,00:11:12.960,I say Nanny Plum is the best cook in the whole world.
00:11:12.960,00:11:15.880,"Oh. Thank you, Your Majesty."
00:11:20.000,00:11:21.200,Hello?
00:11:21.200,00:11:24.360,Hello.
00:11:24.360,00:11:26.840,It's King and Queen Marigold.
00:11:26.840,00:11:28.320,"Oh, no."
00:11:28.320,00:11:31.000,They're so boring and snooty.
00:11:31.000,00:11:39.520,"We were just eating a lovely meal of spinach with sea foam, when we thought how nice it would be if you joined us for dinner tomorrow."
00:11:39.520,00:11:43.120,They've invited us for dinner tomorrow.
00:11:43.120,00:11:44.400,"Oh, no."
00:11:44.400,00:11:46.720,"Don't worry, I'll handle this."
00:11:46.720,00:11:49.200,"Sorry, we can't come for dinner."
00:11:49.200,00:11:51.640,"Oh, dear. What a shame."
00:11:51.640,00:11:54.680,I know you hardly ever get to eat good food.
00:11:54.680,00:11:59.120,What? I'll have you know we have the best cook in the whole world.
00:11:59.120,00:12:01.880,You have the best cook in the whole world?
00:12:01.880,00:12:03.520,Yes.
00:12:03.520,00:12:05.960,"Oh, then we must come to you for dinner instead."
00:12:05.960,00:12:08.960,See you tomorrow.
00:12:12.760,00:12:16.440,I've got some good news and some bad news.
00:12:18.640,00:12:22.560,We're not going to King and Queen Marigold's for dinner tomorrow.
00:12:22.560,00:12:23.960,ALL: Hooray!
00:12:23.960,00:12:26.120,What's the bad news?
00:12:26.120,00:12:28.040,They're coming here.
00:12:28.040,00:12:29.520,"ALL: Oh, no."
00:12:29.520,00:12:30.880,What are we going to do?
00:12:30.880,00:12:34.600,King and Queen Marigold will want to eat something special.
00:12:34.600,00:12:38.000,"Luckily, we have the best cook in the whole world."
00:12:38.000,00:12:39.240,Nanny Plum.
00:12:39.240,00:12:41.760,"Oh, heh, thank you, Your Majesty."
00:12:41.760,00:12:49.840,What about baked potato stuffed with potato with chips and mash and a fried egg on top.
00:12:49.840,00:12:51.000,"No, Nanny."
00:12:51.000,00:12:54.360,They will want special modern food.
00:12:54.360,00:12:55.800,I can cook porridge.
00:12:55.800,00:12:58.040,That's not modern food.
00:12:58.040,00:13:00.760,"What is modern food, Mommy?"
00:13:00.760,00:13:05.200,It is very delicate food in tiny portions.
00:13:05.200,00:13:06.920,I can do tiny portions.
00:13:08.440,00:13:10.880,"Well done, Nanny."
00:13:12.000,00:13:14.880,"Of course, it will get bigger when the magic wears off."
00:13:14.880,00:13:17.720,"When is the magic going to wear off, Nanny?"
00:13:17.720,00:13:19.560,"Um, about now."
00:13:21.960,00:13:23.960,Excuse me.
00:13:23.960,00:13:27.240,"It's not just the size of the food, Nanny."
00:13:27.240,00:13:29.680,Modern cooking is fussy.
00:13:29.680,00:13:30.800,No problem.
00:13:30.800,00:13:33.920,Nanny has until tomorrow evening to come up with something.
00:13:33.920,00:13:36.280,"Uh... Yes, Your Majesty."
00:13:36.280,00:13:39.400,Good. That's that sorted.
00:13:39.400,00:13:42.480,"Nanny, what are you going to do?"
00:13:42.480,00:13:45.680,"Uh, I don't know."
00:13:51.880,00:13:54.560,"Morning, Holly."
00:13:54.560,00:13:55.880,"No, Ben."
00:13:55.880,00:13:59.040,I need to help Nanny learn how to cook.
00:13:59.040,00:14:01.600,But Nanny Plum is a very good cook.
00:14:01.600,00:14:05.280,"She is the best cook in the world, Ben."
00:14:05.280,00:14:08.080,But she can't cook modern food.
00:14:08.080,00:14:11.160,Why does she need to cook modern food?
00:14:11.160,00:14:13.560,It's what King and Queen Marigold like.
00:14:13.560,00:14:15.960,And they're coming to dinner tonight.
00:14:18.760,00:14:21.320,Come on.
00:14:27.920,00:14:30.000,Where are we going?
00:14:30.000,00:14:32.920,The Great Elf Library.
00:14:32.920,00:14:35.840,Whoo!
00:14:35.840,00:14:38.560,"Excuse me, Wise Old Elf."
00:14:38.560,00:14:41.680,Shush. This is a library.
00:14:41.680,00:14:43.200,Sorry.
00:14:43.200,00:14:46.840,We need a book of modern cooking for Nanny Plum.
00:14:46.840,00:14:50.040,But Nanny Plum is an excellent cook.
00:14:50.040,00:14:53.720,"Yes, she's the best cook in the whole world."
00:14:53.720,00:14:56.960,But she can't do modern cooking.
00:14:56.960,00:14:59.480,Mm. Let's see.
00:14:59.480,00:15:01.360,The Elf Book of Pies.
00:15:01.360,00:15:03.640,The World of Spaghetti and Mash.
00:15:03.640,00:15:06.840,Complete History of Egg Sandwiches.
00:15:06.840,00:15:09.240,Is there anything modern?
00:15:09.240,00:15:13.360,"What exactly is modern cooking, Princess Holly?"
00:15:13.360,00:15:16.920,It is food that's very delicate and special.
00:15:16.920,00:15:18.920,And not porridge.
00:15:20.560,00:15:22.120,Wait a minute.
00:15:22.120,00:15:24.160,This doesn't look like an elf book.
00:15:24.160,00:15:26.480,That's because I'm not.
00:15:26.480,00:15:29.680,Aah! A magical fairy book?
00:15:29.680,00:15:33.040,What's that doing in my elf library?
00:15:33.040,00:15:35.840,There are no words in the book.
00:15:35.840,00:15:38.160,I am a magical cookery book.
00:15:38.160,00:15:40.120,Where are all your recipes?
00:15:40.120,00:15:43.960,"Oh, you tell me what you want to cook, I will tell you how to cook it."
00:15:43.960,00:15:48.760,"We want to cook a special modern meal, please."
00:15:48.760,00:15:49.960,How modern?
00:15:49.960,00:15:52.280,"Uh, very modern."
00:15:52.280,00:15:53.640,Certainly.
00:15:53.640,00:15:56.720,You will need the following ingredients.
00:15:56.720,00:16:00.280,"Potato, carrot, onion, peas, and cheese."
00:16:00.280,00:16:02.480,That doesn't sound very special.
00:16:02.480,00:16:05.720,Shush. I am thinking.
00:16:05.720,00:16:06.960,Voila.
00:16:06.960,00:16:11.000,One recipe for a very modern meal.
00:16:11.000,00:16:12.240,BOTH: Hooray!
00:16:12.240,00:16:15.800,Shh. This is a library.
00:16:15.800,00:16:19.360,"Can I borrow this book, Wise Old Elf?"
00:16:19.360,00:16:22.080,"You can keep it, Princess Holly."
00:16:22.080,00:16:26.200,Fairy books do not belong in the elf library.
00:16:26.200,00:16:27.520,Thank you.
00:16:33.560,00:16:37.360,King and Queen Marigold.
00:16:37.360,00:16:38.960,"Hello, darling."
00:16:38.960,00:16:42.360,It's always a pleasure to visit your Little Kingdom.
00:16:43.640,00:16:45.040,I hope you're hungry.
00:16:45.040,00:16:47.240,Nanny's been in the kitchen all day.
00:16:47.240,00:16:50.440,We haven't eaten a thing since breakfast.
00:16:50.440,00:16:55.880,We didn't want to spoil a dinner made by the best cook in the whole world.
00:16:55.880,00:16:58.760,I wonder if baked beans are modern?
00:16:58.760,00:17:02.160,"Nanny, we've got a magic cookbook."
00:17:02.160,00:17:03.600,"Hello, Nanny Plum."
00:17:03.600,00:17:06.520,"Oh, you found my cookbook."
00:17:06.520,00:17:07.720,Where was she?
00:17:07.720,00:17:09.880,She was in the elf library.
00:17:09.880,00:17:11.760,What were you doing in there?
00:17:14.840,00:17:17.880,The book knows a recipe for a modern meal.
00:17:17.880,00:17:20.120,"Oh, good."
00:17:20.120,00:17:24.320,"A potato, a carrot, an onion, some peas, and cheese."
00:17:24.320,00:17:26.960,But that's what I would normally cook.
00:17:26.960,00:17:31.480,"Yes. The ingredients are simple, but the way we cook them is not."
00:17:31.480,00:17:32.960,"Now, boil a pot of water."
00:17:34.480,00:17:38.760,"Chop potato, carrot, onion, peas, and cheese."
00:17:38.760,00:17:41.000,And put them into the pot.
00:17:41.000,00:17:47.320,Boil for one minute and then collect the steam and serve.
00:17:47.320,00:17:49.600,HOLLY: Is that it?
00:17:49.600,00:17:52.840,It is a very delicate dish.
00:17:54.560,00:17:57.720,It's so good of you to have us at such short notice.
00:17:57.720,00:17:59.760,No trouble at all.
00:17:59.760,00:18:05.360,We can't wait to see what the best cook in the world cooks for dinner.
00:18:06.560,00:18:08.200,"Oh, sorry. That's my tummy."
00:18:08.200,00:18:10.800,I'm just so looking forward to this lovely meal.
00:18:11.880,00:18:15.440,Dinner is served.
00:18:17.240,00:18:19.880,"Enjoy your meal, Majesties."
00:18:22.320,00:18:26.600,"Oh, yes."
00:18:26.600,00:18:29.160,So subtle.
00:18:29.160,00:18:32.040,Your Majesty?
00:18:32.040,00:18:35.000,Cloud of vegetable soup.
00:18:35.000,00:18:36.920,It's just steam.
00:18:36.920,00:18:40.200,Such a sensitive dish.
00:18:41.400,00:18:44.720,Mm. How wonderful.
00:18:44.720,00:18:46.960,Does it come with any potatoes?
00:18:46.960,00:18:48.840,Uh... No.
00:18:50.080,00:18:53.040,"Nanny, I'm hungry."
00:18:53.040,00:18:54.440,KIDS: Me too.
00:18:54.440,00:18:56.280,No problem.
00:18:56.280,00:19:01.320,"These leftover potatoes, carrots, onions, peas and cheese have made a lovely soup."
00:19:01.320,00:19:03.400,ALL: Ooh. Yummy.
00:19:07.160,00:19:11.120,"Um, this steam is delicious, of course."
00:19:11.120,00:19:14.000,But will there be anything else to follow?
00:19:14.000,00:19:19.600,"Yes. Even though it's very filling, I could eat a tiny something more."
00:19:19.600,00:19:22.840,"I could eat a lot, lot more."
00:19:24.200,00:19:27.880,What's that lovely smell?
00:19:27.880,00:19:30.440,It's coming from the kitchen.
00:19:32.640,00:19:35.080,"This is delicious, Nanny."
00:19:35.080,00:19:37.640,Mm. It's the best.
00:19:37.640,00:19:40.920,"I say, what's this?"
00:19:40.920,00:19:42.640,It's just the children's supper.
00:19:42.640,00:19:45.120,It smells very nice.
00:19:45.120,00:19:48.280,It's only some soup I made from the leftovers.
00:19:48.280,00:19:51.200,It's not very modern.
00:19:51.200,00:19:53.880,"Could I try, just a little bit?"
00:19:58.080,00:20:00.920,The taste is so tasty!
00:20:00.920,00:20:02.080,Can I try some too?
00:20:02.080,00:20:04.000,And me.
00:20:09.600,00:20:10.840,"Oh, yes."
00:20:10.840,00:20:12.680,So filling. Heh.
00:20:12.680,00:20:14.640,"Marvelous, Nanny."
00:20:15.960,00:20:17.920,I have an announcement to make.
00:20:17.920,00:20:23.200,Nanny Plum is indeed the best cook in the whole world.
00:20:25.000,00:20:28.160,Thank you very much.
00:20:30.960,00:20:34.400,Something modern or my treacle pudding?
00:20:34.400,00:20:36.760,ALL: Treacle pudding.
00:00:15.200,00:00:16.840,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:18.400,00:00:21.080,And I'm Princess Holly.
00:00:35.640,00:00:42.760,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:00:48.840,00:00:50.560,"What's the plan for today, Nanny Plum?"
00:00:50.560,00:00:53.280,You're visiting the Elf Factory.
00:00:53.280,00:00:54.520,Why?
00:00:54.520,00:01:00.800,"Well, your Majesty, it's a very busy time of the year for the Elf Factory, what with Christmas coming up."
00:01:00.800,00:01:02.960,"So, what's that got to do with me?"
00:01:02.960,00:01:06.200,You have to inspect the toys and make sure they are perfect.
00:01:07.400,00:01:08.760,That sounds fun.
00:01:08.760,00:01:10.360,"Well, it's not fun, Holly."
00:01:15.120,00:01:16.560,Do I have to go?
00:01:16.560,00:01:18.360,"Well, someone has to."
00:01:18.360,00:01:20.520,They're expecting a royal visit.
00:01:20.520,00:01:24.680,I could go. And I could say the toys are perfect.
00:01:26.160,00:01:29.560,"And Nanny Plum can go along too, to look after you."
00:01:37.600,00:01:39.680,"Hi, Holly."
00:01:39.680,00:01:43.280,We've come to see the Elf Factory.
00:01:43.280,00:01:45.280,Do you know where it is?
00:01:45.280,00:01:47.800,Of course I do.
00:01:49.520,00:01:51.040,So where is it?
00:01:51.040,00:01:54.240,Follow me.
00:01:54.240,00:01:57.200,Ooh!
00:01:57.200,00:02:01.560,This is the Elf Factory reception.
00:02:01.560,00:02:03.320,Good morning.
00:02:03.320,00:02:06.800,Hello. Princess Holly is here for the royal visit.
00:02:06.800,00:02:10.000,I see.
00:02:10.000,00:02:12.000,"Uh, what do I do?"
00:02:12.000,00:02:14.960,Just put your name and job.
00:02:14.960,00:02:23.160,"My name is Princess Holly, and my job is being a pretty fairy princess."
00:02:23.160,00:02:24.600,Very good.
00:02:24.600,00:02:26.760,"Now, you will need these hard hats."
00:02:28.280,00:02:30.880,And I notice you have wands.
00:02:30.880,00:02:33.360,"Yes, we're fairies."
00:02:33.360,00:02:35.160,I'll need to take your wands.
00:02:39.560,00:02:41.880,Elves don't do magic.
00:02:41.880,00:02:44.120,And we are elves.
00:02:45.280,00:02:48.440,"Oh, now-- Here we go."
00:02:51.400,00:02:53.720,The factory is very busy today.
00:02:53.720,00:02:58.280,We have a very big toy order for Father Christmas.
00:02:58.280,00:03:00.440,BOTH: Wow!
00:03:00.440,00:03:02.480,Is that Father Christmas?
00:03:02.480,00:03:05.200,"Oh, I shouldn't think so."
00:03:05.200,00:03:06.920,FATHER CHRISTMAS: Ho-ho-ho!
00:03:06.920,00:03:09.160,"Oh. Hello, Mr. Christmas."
00:03:12.320,00:03:13.560,"Yes, yes."
00:03:13.560,00:03:15.520,I shall get him right away.
00:03:16.880,00:03:19.360,Telephone call for the Wise Old Elf.
00:03:23.680,00:03:25.720,"Hello, Princess Holly."
00:03:25.720,00:03:27.640,"Hello, Wise Old Elf."
00:03:27.640,00:03:30.040,It's Father Christmas.
00:03:30.040,00:03:32.760,Excuse me a moment. Hello?
00:03:34.880,00:03:38.720,Will those dolls be ready in time for Christmas?
00:03:38.720,00:03:40.360,"Yes, Mr. Christmas."
00:03:40.360,00:03:43.400,We'll definitely have the dolls ready today.
00:03:43.400,00:03:47.400,"And you will make sure they have a pretty red dress, won't you?"
00:03:47.400,00:03:50.800,"Yes, she'll have a lovely red dress."
00:03:50.800,00:03:53.720,Thank you. Goodbye.
00:03:53.720,00:03:56.920,Is this the doll you're making for Father Christmas?
00:03:56.920,00:04:00.000,Yes.
00:03:56.920,00:04:02.440,"We're making hundreds of them, and they have to be ready today."
00:04:02.440,00:04:04.680,Can we see how you make them?
00:04:04.680,00:04:05.960,Of course.
00:04:05.960,00:04:07.720,This way.
00:04:09.040,00:04:11.440,We'll be taking the train.
00:04:11.440,00:04:13.160,BOTH: Ooh.
00:04:13.160,00:04:14.520,All aboard.
00:04:14.520,00:04:18.680,"First stop, Level 1, the computer room."
00:04:22.600,00:04:24.800,"Hold tight, everyone."
00:04:24.800,00:04:26.760,ALL: Whee!
00:04:28.840,00:04:32.080,ALL: Whee!
00:04:32.080,00:04:33.480,Level 1.
00:04:33.480,00:04:35.480,The computer room.
00:04:36.680,00:04:37.880,That was fun.
00:04:40.280,00:04:41.560,"Good, wasn't it?"
00:04:41.560,00:04:44.640,And it'll be even better next time.
00:04:44.640,00:04:46.400,"What do you mean, next time?"
00:04:46.400,00:04:48.680,"Hee, hee."
00:04:48.680,00:04:51.280,Follow me.
00:04:53.200,00:04:57.520,This is where we decide what the toys will look like.
00:04:57.520,00:05:00.200,Don't you just make it up as you go along?
00:05:00.200,00:05:02.120,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:05:02.120,00:05:06.040,The toys are designed to the very last detail.
00:05:06.040,00:05:08.480,Nothing is left to chance.
00:05:08.480,00:05:11.840,Gosh. It seems like a lot of hard work to me.
00:05:11.840,00:05:15.840,We pride ourselves on our thoroughness.
00:05:15.840,00:05:18.600,This is where we choose the colors.
00:05:18.600,00:05:21.160,That's the doll for Father Christmas.
00:05:21.160,00:05:30.720,"Yes. Now, for example, if I wanted to, I could change the color of the doll's dress from red to blue."
00:05:30.720,00:05:32.520,COMPUTER: Blue dress.
00:05:32.520,00:05:37.920,The Elf Factory would then know to paint the doll's dress blue.
00:05:37.920,00:05:41.000,But Father Christmas wants the dress red.
00:05:41.000,00:05:43.680,"Of course he does, Princess Holly."
00:05:43.680,00:05:46.240,That was just an example.
00:05:46.240,00:05:50.640,All aboard.
00:05:50.640,00:05:53.320,"Oh. We don't have to go down again, do we?"
00:05:53.320,00:05:55.760,"Yes, Nanny."
00:05:55.760,00:06:00.000,The factory is deep down in the roots of the tree.
00:06:00.000,00:06:02.320,How deep down?
00:06:02.320,00:06:05.760,BOTH: Very deep down.
00:06:05.760,00:06:08.400,All aboard.
00:06:11.240,00:06:14.760,We're not going down very much.
00:06:14.760,00:06:16.200,"BEN: Just you wait, Holly."
00:06:16.200,00:06:19.640,"Next stop, Level 99."
00:06:19.640,00:06:21.320,Hold tight!
00:06:22.720,00:06:25.880,ALL: Whoa!
00:06:25.880,00:06:28.240,Aah! My tummy!
00:06:28.240,00:06:30.480,This is fun!
00:06:30.480,00:06:31.760,ALL: Whee!
00:06:35.760,00:06:40.280,Level 99. The Elf Factory.
00:06:40.280,00:06:42.600,And the gloop machine.
00:06:42.600,00:06:44.440,The what?
00:06:44.440,00:06:47.080,BEN: The gloop machine.
00:06:47.080,00:06:48.480,HOLLY: Wow!
00:06:48.480,00:06:50.240,"This way, Princess Holly."
00:06:50.240,00:06:55.200,Please feel free to ask any questions.
00:06:55.200,00:06:56.920,Hee-hee-hee. Okay.
00:06:56.920,00:06:59.480,"Hello, what do you do?"
00:06:59.480,00:07:03.200,"I pull this lever, Princess Holly."
00:07:03.200,00:07:04.680,What else do you do?
00:07:04.680,00:07:09.400,I pull this lever and the gloop comes out.
00:07:09.400,00:07:10.800,Don't you get bored?
00:07:10.800,00:07:12.880,Elves never get bored.
00:07:12.880,00:07:14.480,And I'm an elf.
00:07:15.720,00:07:20.400,Thank you. Now moving on.
00:07:20.400,00:07:23.000,That's the molding machine.
00:07:23.000,00:07:25.400,Ooh.
00:07:25.400,00:07:27.520,And what do you do?
00:07:29.840,00:07:31.240,All day?
00:07:31.240,00:07:33.960,"Yes, all day."
00:07:33.960,00:07:35.840,You must be very patient.
00:07:35.840,00:07:37.760,Elves are very patient.
00:07:37.760,00:07:40.120,And I'm an elf.
00:07:40.120,00:07:42.240,What happens next?
00:07:42.240,00:07:45.440,Next is the paint room.
00:07:45.440,00:07:48.640,This is where the toys are painted.
00:07:48.640,00:07:51.200,What fun.
00:07:51.200,00:07:53.400,"ALL: Hello, Princess Holly."
00:07:53.400,00:07:57.000,Every elf has their bit to paint.
00:07:57.000,00:08:05.400,"One paints the eyes, another the mouth, and another the hair."
00:08:05.400,00:08:06.720,NANNY: Amazing.
00:08:06.720,00:08:09.760,I thought it would be all done by machine.
00:08:09.760,00:08:14.040,No. We do it all by hand.
00:08:14.040,00:08:16.600,NANNY: It looks such hard work.
00:08:16.600,00:08:18.120,Elves like hard work.
00:08:18.120,00:08:20.200,ELVES: And we're elves!
00:08:20.200,00:08:22.920,"Well, thank goodness I'm a fairy."
00:08:22.920,00:08:24.400,"Shush, Nanny."
00:08:24.400,00:08:30.680,"WISE OLD ELF: Once the dress is painted, the doll goes through to the dryer."
00:08:32.480,00:08:36.440,"And then it's packed, ready for delivery."
00:08:36.440,00:08:38.560,And here we are.
00:08:38.560,00:08:40.760,The finished doll.
00:08:40.760,00:08:44.920,A perfect example of elf workmanship.
00:08:44.920,00:08:48.080,Isn't the doll's dress supposed to be red?
00:08:48.080,00:08:49.880,"WISE OLD ELF: What? Ho, ho."
00:08:49.880,00:08:52.200,"You're quite right, Princess Holly."
00:08:52.200,00:08:53.640,"Oh, never mind."
00:08:53.640,00:08:57.520,Some mistakes occur when you're making so many dolls.
00:08:57.520,00:09:00.280,But they've all got blue dresses.
00:09:01.520,00:09:02.720,She's right.
00:09:02.720,00:09:05.760,We'll have to unpack them all and paint them again.
00:09:05.760,00:09:08.000,But there's not enough time.
00:09:08.000,00:09:11.760,I could sort this out in a moment with a bit of magic.
00:09:11.760,00:09:15.360,Magic is not allowed in the Elf Factory.
00:09:15.360,00:09:19.800,"Okay, I'll just ring up Father Christmas and tell him what's happened."
00:09:21.240,00:09:24.080,I'm sure he'll understand.
00:09:24.080,00:09:26.760,No! No!
00:09:26.760,00:09:33.280,"Uh, maybe Nanny Plum can use a bit of magic, just this once."
00:09:33.280,00:09:36.840,Good. First I need my wand.
00:09:44.040,00:09:45.560,"Ah. Hello, wand."
00:09:45.560,00:09:48.200,Ahem.
00:09:48.200,00:09:55.400,Blue to red ALL: Hooray! It worked!
00:09:55.400,00:09:57.280,Heh. Thank you.
00:10:00.280,00:10:03.680,"A chair for Nanny Plum, please."
00:10:03.680,00:10:05.000,What's this for?
00:10:05.000,00:10:09.120,"One down, 999 to go."
00:10:09.120,00:10:10.680,NANNY: Oh.
00:10:10.680,00:10:24.760,"Blue to red Blue to red Blue to red Heh. Gosh, Nanny, you must be so patient."
00:10:24.760,00:10:29.880,"Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:10:38.680,00:10:46.600,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Great Elf Tree.
00:10:50.160,00:10:51.440,"Look, Dad."
00:10:51.440,00:10:53.640,All the leaves are falling off our tree.
00:10:53.640,00:10:57.760,"It's autumn, Ben."
00:10:57.760,00:11:01.680,"Mind you, there'll be leaf-sweeping work to do."
00:11:01.680,00:11:03.200,Let's get everyone organized.
00:11:04.320,00:11:08.080,Calling all elves!
00:11:08.080,00:11:09.320,ALL: Right-o!
00:11:14.000,00:11:18.960,ALL: And what are we?
00:11:18.960,00:11:20.360,ALL: We're elves!
00:11:24.480,00:11:25.920,Oh. Never mind.
00:11:28.880,00:11:33.600,ALL: And what are we?
00:11:33.600,00:11:35.480,ALL: We're elves!
00:11:38.360,00:11:41.520,"So many leaves, I have to use three magic brooms."
00:11:41.520,00:11:45.640,"Nanny, why do the leaves fall off the trees?"
00:11:45.640,00:11:47.160,Goodness knows.
00:11:47.160,00:11:49.840,Autumn leaves are so pretty.
00:11:49.840,00:11:55.520,"Ugh. They might look pretty to you, Violet, but it just means more work for me."
00:11:55.520,00:11:59.440,This one looks just like the leaf in Ben's hat.
00:11:59.440,00:12:01.360,It's an oak leaf.
00:12:01.360,00:12:03.840,It must be from the Elf Tree.
00:12:03.840,00:12:06.240,I don't know why elves have to live in a tree.
00:12:06.240,00:12:08.160,I don't know why we have to have trees.
00:12:08.160,00:12:09.400,Or autumn.
00:12:09.400,00:12:11.040,"Grumbling again, Nanny?"
00:12:11.040,00:12:13.680,You should be happy.
00:12:13.680,00:12:15.840,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:12:16.960,00:12:19.080,"Where are you going, Nanny?"
00:12:19.080,00:12:21.760,I'm returning these leaves.
00:12:22.720,00:12:25.480,"Wait for us, Nanny!"
00:12:28.760,00:12:33.240,"ELVES: Hello, Wise Old Elf."
00:12:33.240,00:12:35.320,I believe these are your leaves.
00:12:35.320,00:12:38.080,"Oh. Thank you, Nanny Plum."
00:12:38.080,00:12:39.360,"ALL: Hi, girls."
00:12:39.360,00:12:40.960,"GIRLS: Hi, boys."
00:12:40.960,00:12:43.240,Such beautiful colors.
00:12:43.240,00:12:47.200,Look! The leaves in your hats have changed color too.
00:12:49.680,00:12:52.320,Hm. interesting.
00:12:52.320,00:12:53.720,Let's play tag.
00:12:53.720,00:12:56.760,Okay. Tag. You're it!
00:12:56.760,00:12:59.040,Wait. I wasn't ready.
00:12:59.040,00:13:01.080,Ha-ha-ha. Tag!
00:13:03.760,00:13:05.240,Can't catch me.
00:13:05.240,00:13:07.320,"Ooh, look, a birdie."
00:13:07.320,00:13:08.840,Where?
00:13:08.840,00:13:11.280,You tricked me.
00:13:13.120,00:13:15.320,Tag! Holly's it!
00:13:15.320,00:13:19.080,You can't catch me.
00:13:21.240,00:13:23.520,"Oh, look. A squirrel."
00:13:23.520,00:13:25.960,You can't trick me like that.
00:13:25.960,00:13:29.400,"No, Ben, there really is a squirrel."
00:13:29.400,00:13:31.680,Aah! A squirrel!
00:13:31.680,00:13:34.080,"Easy now, Ben Elf."
00:13:34.080,00:13:36.880,What's wrong?
00:13:36.880,00:13:39.920,"Just ignore the squirrel, Princess Holly."
00:13:39.920,00:13:43.480,"Ah, look."
00:13:43.480,00:13:46.920,"Sound the acorn alarm, Mr. Elf!"
00:13:46.920,00:13:48.720,What's going on?
00:13:48.720,00:13:51.920,It might be Acorn Day.
00:13:54.280,00:13:56.320,What's Acorn Day?
00:13:56.320,00:13:58.800,"Not now, Princess Holly."
00:14:00.040,00:14:02.160,Calling all elves!
00:14:02.160,00:14:05.800,Acorn Day has begun.
00:14:05.800,00:14:09.960,Please leave the Elf Tree immediately!
00:14:09.960,00:14:12.640,It's probably a false alarm.
00:14:12.640,00:14:15.920,Yes. Hopefully it's just a practice.
00:14:15.920,00:14:18.280,There he goes!
00:14:18.280,00:14:20.680,Mrs. Elf! Mrs. Elf!
00:14:20.680,00:14:22.560,Hello. Oh.
00:14:23.720,00:14:25.760,"Don't panic, Mrs. Elf!"
00:14:25.760,00:14:27.840,Just hand it back.
00:14:28.920,00:14:32.600,"Get out of there, Mrs. Elf!"
00:14:32.600,00:14:37.240,Will somebody please tell me what's going on?
00:14:37.240,00:14:41.640,"One day, every year, the squirrels come..."
00:14:41.640,00:14:45.640,And store their acorns in the Great Elf Tree.
00:14:45.640,00:14:47.240,We call that day...
00:14:47.240,00:14:49.240,ALL: Acorn Day.
00:14:51.320,00:14:55.120,What's so bad about squirrels storing acorns?
00:14:55.120,00:14:58.800,Yes. They need to store their food for winter.
00:14:58.800,00:15:01.480,And it's just an acorn.
00:15:01.480,00:15:09.280,"WISE OLD ELF: One acorn would be okay, but there are many squirrels and they have many acorns."
00:15:09.280,00:15:13.080,"Oh. I'm sorry I couldn't stop him, Wise Old Elf."
00:15:13.080,00:15:15.800,"It's not your fault, Mrs. Elf."
00:15:15.800,00:15:19.560,There is no stopping them once they've started.
00:15:19.560,00:15:21.440,What do we do now?
00:15:21.440,00:15:32.160,"Now we wait. You see, after one squirrel has put its acorn in the tree, another will come and copy it."
00:15:32.160,00:15:35.560,Squirrels are very good at copying.
00:15:51.920,00:15:54.040,Happy Acorn Day.
00:15:54.040,00:15:56.160,When do the squirrels arrive?
00:15:56.160,00:15:59.000,Oh.
00:15:59.000,00:16:02.880,"The squirrels have filled the Elf Tree with acorns, Daddy."
00:16:02.880,00:16:06.800,"Ah, yes. Very clever animals, those squirrels."
00:16:06.800,00:16:09.360,They're a menace.
00:16:06.800,00:16:15.640,"Well, if you're going to live in an oak tree, with little windows, you might as well put up a sign saying, Store your acorns here."
00:16:17.400,00:16:21.080,"Well, if I've missed the squirrels, I might as well go home."
00:16:21.080,00:16:23.480,Goodbye. Happy Acorn Day.
00:16:23.480,00:16:26.160,ALL: Happy Acorn Day.
00:16:26.160,00:16:31.680,"Wise Old Elf, why don't you just move the acorns somewhere else?"
00:16:31.680,00:16:35.760,Squirrels won't let anyone move their acorns. Watch.
00:16:42.280,00:16:43.760,ALL: Oh.
00:16:43.760,00:16:45.880,What are you going to do now?
00:16:50.440,00:16:54.520,But you said you couldn't move the acorns.
00:16:54.520,00:16:55.680,We can't.
00:16:55.680,00:16:59.640,But we can trick the squirrels into moving the acorns for us.
00:16:59.640,00:17:02.880,How?
00:17:02.880,00:17:06.400,Oh. It's very clever.
00:17:06.400,00:17:08.040,Is it really clever?
00:17:08.040,00:17:09.800,"No, it's stupid."
00:17:09.800,00:17:10.960,But funny.
00:17:10.960,00:17:13.400,Ta-da! Here we are.
00:17:13.400,00:17:14.680,Squeak.
00:17:14.680,00:17:18.360,"Uh, why is the Wise Old Elf dressed as a squirrel?"
00:17:18.360,00:17:21.320,Because squirrels copy other squirrels.
00:17:21.320,00:17:29.320,"Now if I move an acorn, all the other squirrels will copy me and move their acorns too."
00:17:29.320,00:17:33.760,But don't the squirrels need to store their acorns for the winter?
00:17:33.760,00:17:35.440,"Ha, ha, yes."
00:17:35.440,00:17:41.920,That's why I'll lead them to the dry hollow log on the top of the big hill.
00:17:41.920,00:17:44.120,Your costume looks very heavy.
00:17:44.120,00:17:49.800,"Yes, but it's perfectly balanced by the tail."
00:17:49.800,00:17:52.040,Ready for checks?
00:17:52.040,00:17:54.440,Tail?
00:17:54.440,00:17:56.680,Acorn?
00:17:56.680,00:17:59.160,Squirrels watching?
00:17:59.160,00:18:00.960,Go! Go! Go!
00:18:00.960,00:18:04.280,"Squeak, squeak, squeak."
00:18:04.280,00:18:07.800,"We'll see you at the hollow log, Wise Old Elf!"
00:18:11.600,00:18:14.800,Squeak. Squeak.
00:18:14.800,00:18:18.080,I hope the Wise Old Elf will be all right.
00:18:18.080,00:18:19.280,Squeak.
00:18:22.120,00:18:23.320,Squeak.
00:18:28.160,00:18:31.560,ALL: Wise Old Elf!
00:18:33.120,00:18:35.480,"Squeak, squeak."
00:18:40.760,00:18:43.960,"Good, almost there."
00:18:43.960,00:18:46.880,"Oh, no."
00:18:46.880,00:18:49.600,Aah! I'm out of control!
00:18:49.600,00:18:52.280,I can't stop!
00:18:52.280,00:18:54.120,Oh! Oh! Aah!
00:18:58.920,00:19:00.120,Aah!
00:19:00.120,00:19:01.800,I love autumn.
00:19:01.800,00:19:04.000,It's a pity I missed Acorn Day.
00:19:05.760,00:19:07.920,Aah! Ooh!
00:19:09.800,00:19:12.760,Oof! I say. An acorn.
00:19:14.000,00:19:19.360,"WISE OLD ELF: Your Majesty, throw the acorn away."
00:19:19.360,00:19:21.080,A talking squirrel.
00:19:21.080,00:19:25.160,"Throw the acorn away, Your Majesty!"
00:19:25.160,00:19:29.120,Ah. Wise Old Elf.
00:19:29.120,00:19:32.360,"The acorn, Your Majesty."
00:19:32.360,00:19:33.600,It's dangerous!
00:19:33.600,00:19:37.000,"Nonsense, how can an acorn be dangerous?"
00:19:38.720,00:19:42.520,This lovely acorn isn't dangerous.
00:19:42.520,00:19:46.800,Two acorns.
00:19:46.800,00:19:48.880,Aah!
00:19:53.160,00:19:55.320,Was that supposed to happen?
00:19:55.320,00:19:57.720,"Well, not exactly."
00:19:57.720,00:20:02.520,But the castle is a great place to store acorns for the winter.
00:20:05.240,00:20:07.800,What happened? Where am I?
00:20:07.800,00:20:10.200,"Happy Acorn Day, Daddy."
00:20:10.200,00:20:12.040,You didn't miss it after all.
00:20:12.040,00:20:13.920,Oh.
00:20:13.920,00:20:17.600,How am I going to get rid of all these acorns?
00:20:17.600,00:20:21.520,"Uh, you will need this squirrel costume."
00:20:21.520,00:20:23.600,What?
00:20:23.600,00:20:26.880,"You wear the costume, and the squirrels copy you."
00:20:26.880,00:20:28.440,I see.
00:20:28.440,00:20:30.640,"Okay. On with the costume, Nanny."
00:20:30.640,00:20:32.120,Off you go. Chop-chop.
00:20:32.120,00:20:33.360,Uh-- Eh?
00:20:34.760,00:20:36.840,ALL: Happy Acorn Day.
00:20:36.840,00:20:40.360,"Squeak, squeak, squeak!"
00:00:29.880,00:00:33.760,NARRATOR: Ben &amp; Holly's Little Kingdom.
00:00:35.760,00:00:41.160,Today's adventure starts at the meadow.
00:00:44.360,00:00:46.720,BEN: Elf School.
00:00:48.920,00:00:52.400,"Now, Princess Holly, what's the name of this flower?"
00:00:52.400,00:00:54.640,"That's easy, Nanny."
00:00:54.640,00:00:56.000,It's a daisy.
00:00:56.000,00:01:05.320,"Yes, yes, an elf might call it a daisy, but a fairy princess would call it a Bellis perennis."
00:01:06.480,00:01:09.880,Bellis perennis.
00:01:09.880,00:01:11.080,Correct.
00:01:11.080,00:01:14.160,"Now, what is this bluebell called?"
00:01:14.160,00:01:16.080,"Uh, bluebell?"
00:01:16.080,00:01:17.320,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:01:17.320,00:01:23.240,A fairy princess would call it a Hyacinthoides non-scripta.
00:01:24.440,00:01:25.600,"Oh, Nanny."
00:01:25.600,00:01:28.880,Nature class is so boring.
00:01:28.880,00:01:33.360,Why do I have to learn the proper names of all these flowers?
00:01:33.360,00:01:36.560,That is the sort of thing a fairy princess needs to know.
00:01:36.560,00:01:40.480,"Well, maybe I don't want to be a fairy princess."
00:01:42.920,00:01:45.200,"Hi, Holly."
00:01:45.200,00:01:46.680,Where are you going?
00:01:46.680,00:01:48.720,I'm off to Elf School.
00:01:48.720,00:01:51.480,Oh.
00:01:53.880,00:01:55.400,That sounds fun.
00:01:55.400,00:02:00.440,"It is. Elves love making toys, and I'm an elf."
00:02:03.120,00:02:05.600,I want to make toys.
00:02:05.600,00:02:08.640,"Nanny, can I go to Elf School too?"
00:02:08.640,00:02:10.480,But you're not an elf.
00:02:10.480,00:02:13.080,You're a royal fairy princess.
00:02:13.080,00:02:15.040,"Oh, please, Nanny Plum."
00:02:15.040,00:02:18.800,"Please, Nanny Plum, let Holly come."
00:02:18.800,00:02:21.000,"Oh, okay."
00:02:21.000,00:02:22.520,Hooray!
00:02:24.000,00:02:28.600,But I'll come along too just to make sure you don't get into any mischief.
00:02:33.560,00:02:35.240,We're going to Elf School.
00:02:35.240,00:02:37.320,We're going to Elf School.
00:02:37.320,00:02:39.600,BOTH: We're going to Elf School!
00:02:39.600,00:02:42.120,We're going to Elf School!
00:02:45.640,00:02:47.880,BEN &amp; HOLLY: We're going to Elf School.
00:02:47.880,00:02:50.240,We're going to Elf School.
00:02:53.920,00:02:56.240,Ooh.
00:03:03.840,00:03:06.400,"Good morning, boys and girls."
00:03:10.360,00:03:13.000,"Ah, Nanny Plum."
00:03:13.000,00:03:15.560,"Hello, Mr. Old Elf."
00:03:15.560,00:03:20.080,Princess Holly wants to see what elves get up to in your little school.
00:03:20.080,00:03:22.440,Hm. Very well.
00:03:22.440,00:03:24.720,Holly may join the class.
00:03:24.720,00:03:26.520,"Oh, goody. Heh."
00:03:26.520,00:03:29.960,"But no magic or flying, please."
00:03:29.960,00:03:31.200,Okay.
00:03:31.200,00:03:33.520,"Holly, sit next to me."
00:03:35.480,00:03:37.400,No flying.
00:03:37.400,00:03:39.120,You will kindly walk.
00:03:43.400,00:03:46.800,Only because elves can't fly.
00:03:46.800,00:03:49.480,"That's right, Mistress Plum."
00:03:49.480,00:03:54.440,"Elves cannot fly, but we do have very good hearing."
00:03:57.680,00:04:01.240,And elves are very good at making toys.
00:04:01.240,00:04:05.920,"So today, we are going to make toys."
00:04:07.200,00:04:12.080,We will carry on from where we left off last time.
00:04:14.600,00:04:16.480,I'm making a toy car.
00:04:16.480,00:04:19.120,I'm making a toy duck.
00:04:19.120,00:04:20.920,A toy helicopter.
00:04:20.920,00:04:22.720,A toy boat.
00:04:22.720,00:04:25.040,I'm making a toy frog.
00:04:25.040,00:04:26.480,A toy rabbit.
00:04:26.480,00:04:29.320,I'm making a robot.
00:04:29.320,00:04:31.040,Ooh.
00:04:31.040,00:04:34.120,I see that Miss Holly does not have a toy.
00:04:34.120,00:04:35.320,That's okay.
00:04:35.320,00:04:37.720,I'll magic one.
00:04:49.280,00:04:50.960,ALL: Ooh.
00:05:00.200,00:05:02.640,Only because elves can't do magic.
00:05:02.640,00:05:10.480,"Ahem. Elves could do magic if they wanted to, but elves don't do magic."
00:05:10.480,00:05:12.560,ALL: And we're elves.
00:05:22.920,00:05:25.240,"Thank you, Wise Old Elf."
00:05:25.240,00:05:36.480,And I will take this wand for now so that you learn how to work the proper elf way without magic.
00:05:36.480,00:05:37.760,Oh.
00:05:37.760,00:05:41.560,"Don't worry, you can have it back at the end of the class."
00:05:43.120,00:05:51.000,"Boys and girls, take out your hammers and remember to tap gently."
00:06:09.040,00:06:13.240,"Oh, no, I didn't meant to do that."
00:06:13.240,00:06:16.440,"Don't worry, Holly, I'll fix it."
00:06:16.440,00:06:18.640,I've still got my magic wand.
00:06:18.640,00:06:23.400,"But, Nanny, magic isn't allowed at Elf School."
00:06:23.400,00:06:26.000,"Oh, it'll be all right."
00:06:26.000,00:06:27.880,No one will notice.
00:06:34.080,00:06:35.840,What was that loud bang?
00:06:35.840,00:06:39.920,"Uh, I think there's a bit of a storm brewing outside."
00:06:41.880,00:06:46.160,"Hm. Well, as long as there's no magic going on."
00:06:46.160,00:06:52.840,"I assure you, Mr. Old Elf, Princess Holly is not using magic."
00:06:52.840,00:06:55.320,Naughty Nanny Plum.
00:06:55.320,00:06:56.600,"Oh, shush."
00:06:56.600,00:07:00.840,Now it's time to paint our toys.
00:07:00.840,00:07:04.160,"Remember, be very careful."
00:07:04.160,00:07:07.680,"A little paint goes a long, long way."
00:07:21.040,00:07:26.000,"Oh, bother, doing things without magic is very hard."
00:07:26.000,00:07:31.080,Maybe you need just a teeny tiny bit of magic.
00:07:31.080,00:07:33.320,"Oh, are you sure?"
00:07:33.320,00:07:35.120,Trust me.
00:07:42.120,00:07:45.320,"Miss Holly, are you doing magic?"
00:07:45.320,00:07:49.280,"No, Wise Old Elf. Not me."
00:07:49.280,00:07:52.920,Ahem. I think it's just the storm outside.
00:07:52.920,00:07:55.200,It must be really close now.
00:07:55.200,00:07:57.280,Hm.
00:07:57.280,00:08:01.680,There's something funny going on around here.
00:08:01.680,00:08:06.200,"HOLLY: Wise Old Elf, what do we do next?"
00:08:06.200,00:08:08.200,"A good question, Holly."
00:08:08.200,00:08:11.240,"Next, we wind the toys up."
00:08:18.840,00:08:21.320,"Look, it works."
00:08:21.320,00:08:23.360,Wow.
00:08:26.920,00:08:29.840,"Ha, ha. Cool."
00:08:32.000,00:08:36.000,"Go on, do something."
00:08:36.000,00:08:40.360,"Nanny, my owl doesn't work."
00:08:40.360,00:08:44.760,"Don't worry, I'll just give it a little help."
00:08:48.800,00:08:52.960,Nanny Plum.
00:08:52.960,00:08:57.400,Just a teeny tiny little bit to help things along.
00:08:57.400,00:09:00.320,You are a very naughty fairy.
00:09:00.320,00:09:02.680,"Sorry, Wise Old Elf."
00:09:04.120,00:09:06.880,We'll say no more about it.
00:09:06.880,00:09:12.080,"Now, Holly, let's see what your owl can do."
00:09:14.080,00:09:17.480,"Uh, it doesn't work at all."
00:09:17.480,00:09:24.160,Mm. Maybe too much magic went into its making.
00:09:25.480,00:09:26.680,I can fix it.
00:09:26.680,00:09:29.680,I'm very good at mending things.
00:09:41.400,00:09:43.960,"There, that should do it."
00:09:48.480,00:09:51.040,ALL: Hooray!
00:09:51.040,00:09:53.000,"Thank you, Ben."
00:09:53.000,00:09:55.920,I did try to do it the elf way.
00:09:55.920,00:09:59.120,"Yes, Holly, I know you did."
00:09:59.120,00:10:03.600,But it's not easy to make toys without using magic.
00:10:03.600,00:10:06.360,It's easy for us because...
00:10:06.360,00:10:08.080,ALL: We're elves.
00:10:12.120,00:10:15.880,"Now, Holly, here's your wand back."
00:10:15.880,00:10:17.080,Thank you.
00:10:17.080,00:10:22.760,"And remember, no magic until you have left the classroom."
00:10:22.760,00:10:25.160,"Yes, Wise Old Elf."
00:10:25.160,00:10:29.760,"And that goes for you too, Nanny Plum."
00:10:29.760,00:10:31.480,"Yes, Wise Old Elf."
00:10:38.680,00:10:44.760,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Royal Golf Course.
00:10:46.680,00:10:48.920,HOLLY: The Royal Golf Course.
00:10:50.040,00:10:51.760,"It is simple, really."
00:11:00.080,00:11:01.600,It's a bit boring.
00:11:01.600,00:11:06.480,It would be more fun if we had little hills to hit the ball up and down.
00:11:06.480,00:11:11.880,Knocking your ball up hills and around corners is called crazy golf.
00:11:11.880,00:11:13.360,That sounds great.
00:11:13.360,00:11:16.920,"Please, Daddy, can we play crazy golf?"
00:11:16.920,00:11:19.600,We are playing normal golf.
00:11:23.720,00:11:26.680,"Wow, where did these hills come from?"
00:11:26.680,00:11:28.840,Daddy must have magicked them.
00:11:28.840,00:11:30.360,"Thanks, Daddy."
00:11:30.360,00:11:32.840,I didn't magic these hills.
00:11:32.840,00:11:34.240,Then who did?
00:11:34.240,00:11:35.800,I don't know.
00:11:35.800,00:11:38.400,But I'm going to find out.
00:11:38.400,00:11:39.600,Wise Old Elf.
00:11:39.600,00:11:42.240,"Good morning, King Thistle."
00:11:42.240,00:11:45.360,Who made these hills on my golf course?
00:11:51.640,00:11:53.080,"Well, get rid of it."
00:11:53.080,00:12:00.040,"We've been trying to chase it away all morning, Your Majesty."
00:12:00.040,00:12:03.600,"Don't you know how to get rid of moles, Wise Old Elf?"
00:12:03.600,00:12:05.520,"Uh, no."
00:12:05.520,00:12:06.840,Then who does?
00:12:06.840,00:12:08.360,Nanny Plum.
00:12:08.360,00:12:10.120,She can talk to it.
00:12:10.120,00:12:13.320,She speaks all animal languages.
00:12:13.320,00:12:14.720,Of course.
00:12:14.720,00:12:16.840,Nanny!
00:12:16.840,00:12:18.360,"Yes, Your Majesty?"
00:12:18.360,00:12:21.560,"Ah, Nanny Plum, you talk to animals, don't you?"
00:12:21.560,00:12:23.560,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:12:23.560,00:12:26.880,Then can you tell this mole to leave my golf course?
00:12:26.880,00:12:29.120,"Uh, no, Your Majesty."
00:12:29.120,00:12:30.320,What?
00:12:30.320,00:12:31.920,I can't speak mole.
00:12:31.920,00:12:34.040,It's one of the more difficult animal languages.
00:12:34.040,00:12:35.640,Along with aardvark.
00:12:35.640,00:12:39.320,"Well, can't you use magic to get rid of the mole?"
00:12:39.320,00:12:45.760,"There is one magical method to get rid of moles, but unfortunately, it uses a gnome."
00:12:45.760,00:12:47.000,What's that?
00:12:49.840,00:12:51.040,With a big tummy.
00:12:51.040,00:12:54.520,What? Gnomes are nothing like elves.
00:12:54.520,00:12:59.440,"They eat too much, talk too much, and never do any work."
00:12:59.440,00:13:03.360,"I don't care what you use, just get rid of that mole."
00:13:03.360,00:13:05.800,"Okay, I'll fetch us a gnome."
00:13:09.600,00:13:11.240,Where am I?
00:13:11.240,00:13:13.120,"Hello, Mr. Gnome."
00:13:13.120,00:13:16.360,I've called you here to get rid of some moles.
00:13:16.360,00:13:19.960,It will be my pleasure.
00:13:34.520,00:13:36.840,"Well, that was easy, wasn't it?"
00:13:36.840,00:13:38.000,"Thank you, Gnome."
00:13:38.000,00:13:39.680,How much do I owe you?
00:13:39.680,00:13:42.800,"Oh, I'm not finished yet, Your Majesty."
00:13:42.800,00:13:47.200,"If I go now, the mole will come back."
00:13:47.200,00:13:49.680,What?
00:13:49.680,00:13:51.400,As long as it takes.
00:13:51.400,00:13:52.720,Of course.
00:13:52.720,00:14:00.240,"Getting rid of moles uses a lot of energy, and my tummy is very empty."
00:14:00.240,00:14:03.520,"Nanny Plum, get this gnome some food."
00:14:03.520,00:14:05.480,"Very well, Your Majesty."
00:14:05.480,00:14:10.440,A sack of cheese sandwiches with a bucket of tea.
00:14:10.440,00:14:12.720,"I say, you are hungry."
00:14:12.720,00:14:16.160,I will also need some workers.
00:14:16.160,00:14:19.240,Absolutely.
00:14:16.160,00:14:21.360,"Wise Old Elf, I command you to do whatever the gnome says."
00:14:21.360,00:14:23.120,As you wish.
00:14:23.120,00:14:26.800,"Thank you, Your Majesty."
00:14:26.800,00:14:30.080,Just let me know when you're finished so I can play my golf.
00:14:30.080,00:14:33.000,"Of course, Your Royalness."
00:14:34.240,00:14:37.560,I am the Wise Old Elf.
00:14:37.560,00:14:43.760,I look after this Royal Golf Course and my knowledge of it is second to none.
00:14:43.760,00:14:46.480,Can you use a shovel?
00:14:46.480,00:14:48.360,"Uh, yes."
00:14:48.360,00:14:53.440,Good. The first job is to flatten these hills.
00:14:57.440,00:14:59.040,My name's Ben.
00:14:59.040,00:15:03.440,"And I'm Princess Holly, but you can call me Holly."
00:15:03.440,00:15:07.160,That's nice.
00:15:07.160,00:15:11.160,I need a deck chair and a fishing rod.
00:15:11.160,00:15:14.600,Why do you need a fishing rod on a golf course?
00:15:14.600,00:15:17.760,So I can pretend to fish.
00:15:17.760,00:15:19.880,Pretend to fish?
00:15:24.160,00:15:27.880,"Now quick, before the mole comes back."
00:15:30.240,00:15:35.440,"Abracadabra, cheese sandwiches."
00:15:36.440,00:15:40.360,One bucket of tea.
00:15:40.360,00:15:42.760,"Nanny Plum, Nanny Plum."
00:15:42.760,00:15:47.160,Mr. Gnome needs a deck chair and a fishing rod quickly.
00:15:47.160,00:15:49.600,So he can pretend to fish.
00:15:49.600,00:15:54.160,"Oh, dear, I thought this might happen."
00:15:55.560,00:16:01.800,"We have flattened all the hills, so, um, goodbye."
00:16:01.800,00:16:04.600,"Thank you, Wise Old Elf."
00:16:04.600,00:16:07.920,I will also be needing a windmill.
00:16:07.920,00:16:10.280,What?
00:16:10.280,00:16:15.000,A working windmill is a very difficult thing to build.
00:16:15.000,00:16:18.640,"Ooh, it mustn't actually work."
00:16:18.640,00:16:25.360,"No. Just pretend, but with sails that go round."
00:16:25.360,00:16:27.960,"Oh, all right."
00:16:27.960,00:16:30.080,"Sandwiches, tea."
00:16:30.080,00:16:32.360,Deck chair and fishing rod.
00:16:32.360,00:16:35.080,Most kind.
00:16:44.560,00:16:47.400,What's that noise?
00:16:49.000,00:16:52.440,"Wise Old Elf, what are you doing?"
00:16:52.440,00:16:56.400,We're building a pretend windmill for the gnome.
00:16:56.400,00:16:58.640,A pretend windmill?
00:16:58.640,00:17:02.480,Yes.
00:17:02.480,00:17:04.440,It's just silly.
00:17:06.000,00:17:08.080,Can Holly and I help you?
00:17:08.080,00:17:10.400,"Oh. Yes, please."
00:17:15.080,00:17:18.480,Now we can fix the sails.
00:17:27.800,00:17:30.240,BOTH: Finished.
00:17:32.920,00:17:37.840,Ooh. Argh.
00:17:37.840,00:17:39.280,Not really.
00:17:39.280,00:17:47.960,"Could you get me a bucket of custard and a big jar of pickles, please. Ooh."
00:17:47.960,00:17:50.400,And some plastic flowers.
00:17:50.400,00:17:53.800,You're going to eat plastic flowers?
00:17:53.800,00:17:56.520,No. That would be silly.
00:17:56.520,00:17:58.640,They go with the windmill.
00:18:03.440,00:18:04.840,Thank you.
00:18:04.840,00:18:06.040,Goodbye.
00:18:06.040,00:18:10.120,"Finally, I will need a little bridge."
00:18:10.120,00:18:12.480,What?
00:18:16.760,00:18:21.720,So he wants a bucket of custard and a big jar of pickles?
00:18:21.720,00:18:22.880,Yes.
00:18:22.880,00:18:25.720,Hm. I knew it.
00:18:25.720,00:18:28.080,I should never have used a gnome.
00:18:28.080,00:18:29.640,What's wrong with gnomes?
00:18:30.880,00:18:33.960,They make everyone else work while they just eat and sleep.
00:18:33.960,00:18:36.080,"Grumbling again, Nanny?"
00:18:36.080,00:18:38.440,"I say, are we going on a picnic?"
00:18:38.440,00:18:42.000,"No, Daddy, this is food for Mr. Gnome."
00:18:42.000,00:18:44.080,"What are we going to eat for dinner, Nanny?"
00:18:44.080,00:18:46.760,"There's no food left, Your Majesty."
00:18:46.760,00:18:48.880,The gnome has eaten it all.
00:18:48.880,00:18:54.040,"Nanny, remember that Mr. Gnome needs plastic flowers too."
00:18:54.040,00:18:55.600,Plastic flowers?
00:18:55.600,00:18:57.160,They go with the windmill.
00:18:57.160,00:18:58.600,Windmill?
00:18:58.600,00:19:01.120,I'd better see what this gnome is up to.
00:19:04.640,00:19:10.280,Oh. Argh.
00:19:10.280,00:19:13.160,I couldn't have done a better job myself.
00:19:13.160,00:19:14.960,"Oh, look."
00:19:14.960,00:19:16.400,A pretty bridge.
00:19:16.400,00:19:19.840,"KING THISTLE: I can see you've certainly been working hard, Gnome."
00:19:19.840,00:19:22.440,"Yes, Your Kingliness."
00:19:22.440,00:19:26.080,So when will it be safe for you to leave?
00:19:26.080,00:19:30.400,"Oh, well, I don't think it ever will be, Your Royalness."
00:19:30.400,00:19:31.840,What?
00:19:31.840,00:19:36.600,I might have to stay here forever.
00:19:36.600,00:19:38.880,But what about my golf?
00:19:38.880,00:19:41.040,I won't get in your way.
00:19:41.040,00:19:42.960,But you are in my way.
00:19:42.960,00:19:47.720,"Oh, custard and pickles."
00:19:50.320,00:19:53.760,I can't play golf with all this stuff around.
00:19:53.760,00:19:54.920,I know.
00:19:57.480,00:20:00.480,"Yes, crazy golf."
00:20:06.840,00:20:08.840,"Yes. Heh, heh, heh."
00:20:11.080,00:20:15.800,"Daddy, do you want us to teach you how to play crazy golf?"
00:20:15.800,00:20:17.160,It's fun.
00:20:17.160,00:20:20.360,"Oh, okay."
00:20:20.360,00:20:21.720,What do I do?
00:20:21.720,00:20:28.200,Just hit the ball through the little windmill and into the hole.
00:20:28.200,00:20:29.720,Ho-ho-ho.
00:20:32.040,00:20:33.920,"Ha-ha-ha, this is fun."
00:00:24.280,00:00:26.520,Wait for us.
00:00:35.640,00:00:44.400,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Great Elf Tree on Christmas Eve.
00:00:47.040,00:00:50.960,"Come on, elves, let's get the elf plane loaded."
00:00:50.960,00:00:52.320,ELVES: Righty-o!
00:00:52.320,00:00:53.960,Wind the engine!
00:00:53.960,00:00:56.720,"Roger that, Mr. Elf."
00:00:56.720,00:00:58.160,Wind the engine!
00:01:02.800,00:01:04.160,"GIRLS: Hi, boys."
00:01:04.160,00:01:05.440,"BOYS: Hi, girls."
00:01:05.440,00:01:07.120,What's happening?
00:01:07.120,00:01:09.640,Dad has an important job to do.
00:01:11.080,00:01:13.440,He's flying to the North Pole.
00:01:13.440,00:01:15.720,The North Pole?
00:01:15.720,00:01:21.400,Yes. We're making our final delivery of toys to Father Christmas.
00:01:21.400,00:01:23.000,GIRLS: Ooh.
00:01:23.000,00:01:26.840,Flight 1000.
00:01:26.840,00:01:31.520,Flight 1000.
00:01:31.520,00:01:32.960,"Roger that, control."
00:01:42.800,00:01:45.720,Why are you delivering toys to Father Christmas?
00:01:45.720,00:01:50.680,"Well, who do you think makes all Father Christmas' toys?"
00:01:50.680,00:01:52.320,Um... Elves?
00:01:52.320,00:01:54.840,That's right.
00:01:54.840,00:01:56.080,GIRLS: Aah.
00:01:56.080,00:02:02.080,Elves work all year deep underground in the Elf Factory making toys.
00:02:02.080,00:02:07.720,"JAKE: Then, in December, Ben's dad flies to the North Pole and..."
00:02:07.720,00:02:12.680,Delivers the toys to Father Christmas.
00:02:12.680,00:02:16.680,Does he land at the North Pole and meet Father Christmas?
00:02:16.680,00:02:18.920,"No, he never lands."
00:02:18.920,00:02:22.000,He drops the toys by parachute.
00:02:23.560,00:02:30.400,Then Father Christmas wraps the toys up and delivers them to the children of the world.
00:02:30.400,00:02:34.040,All the children?
00:02:34.040,00:02:37.000,"WISE OLD ELF: Oh, yes, even Lucy."
00:02:37.000,00:02:38.960,I love Christmas.
00:02:38.960,00:02:40.440,And I love snow.
00:02:40.440,00:02:41.640,Me too.
00:02:41.640,00:02:44.160,I wish it was snowing now.
00:02:44.160,00:02:46.720,Yes. It's Christmas Eve.
00:02:46.720,00:02:49.120,When's it going to snow?
00:02:49.120,00:02:52.280,Maybe it's time for a weather forecast.
00:02:52.280,00:02:54.040,Weather forecast?
00:02:54.040,00:02:58.560,Yes. We can use my elf weather detector.
00:02:58.560,00:03:00.160,ALL: Wow!
00:03:00.160,00:03:03.520,So can this machine tell if it's going to snow?
00:03:03.520,00:03:04.880,Of course.
00:03:04.880,00:03:06.480,How does it work?
00:03:06.480,00:03:10.680,I listen to the weather through this giant ear trumpet.
00:03:10.680,00:03:16.880,"It's so sensitive, I can hear a butterfly flapping its wings in Africa."
00:03:16.880,00:03:19.120,Can you hear any butterflies?
00:03:19.120,00:03:20.360,Aah!
00:03:20.360,00:03:22.920,Don't talk loudly into the trumpet.
00:03:22.920,00:03:25.160,"Sorry, Wise Old Elf."
00:03:25.160,00:03:29.280,"Now, please, stay quiet."
00:03:30.880,00:03:33.440,"Ah, interesting."
00:03:33.440,00:03:36.360,Is it a butterfly?
00:03:36.360,00:03:39.040,I can hear weather.
00:03:39.040,00:03:40.800,What sort of weather?
00:03:40.800,00:03:43.680,"Uh, ahem."
00:03:40.800,00:03:48.440,"There's a chance of sun or rain, with clear skies or clouds."
00:03:50.320,00:03:53.040,I can say it certainly might.
00:03:53.040,00:03:55.920,"But then again, it might not."
00:03:55.920,00:03:58.400,ALL: Oh.
00:03:58.400,00:04:01.320,Let's ask Nanny Plum if it's going to snow.
00:04:01.320,00:04:03.560,Why ask Nanny Plum?
00:04:03.560,00:04:06.080,Nanny can tell the future.
00:04:06.080,00:04:08.920,Ha! This I must see.
00:04:12.240,00:04:14.560,"Nanny Plum, Nanny Plum."
00:04:14.560,00:04:17.080,"You can tell the future, can't you?"
00:04:17.080,00:04:18.640,I certainly can.
00:04:18.640,00:04:21.760,Can you tell if it's going to snow today?
00:04:21.760,00:04:25.920,Yes. I'll use my special snow forecasting globe.
00:04:25.920,00:04:28.040,"Ho, ho. I see."
00:04:34.600,00:04:38.480,"No, you just shake it."
00:04:34.600,00:04:40.000,Like this: There we are.
00:04:40.000,00:04:41.680,It'll snow today.
00:04:41.680,00:04:44.520,ALL: Hooray!
00:04:48.680,00:04:50.280,It's never been wrong.
00:04:50.280,00:04:52.760,What if you shook it in the summer?
00:04:52.760,00:04:56.440,"Well, you don't shake it in the summer, obviously."
00:04:56.440,00:04:57.760,That would be silly.
00:04:57.760,00:05:01.760,"Well, you can't tell exactly when it's going to snow, can you?"
00:05:01.760,00:05:03.160,"Yes, I can."
00:05:03.160,00:05:05.280,It's going to snow... Now.
00:05:05.280,00:05:08.080,Abracadabra-- That's cheating.
00:05:08.080,00:05:09.480,"No, it's not!"
00:05:09.480,00:05:14.520,--Make it snow Nanny's made it snow.
00:05:14.520,00:05:16.320,Let's go and see it.
00:05:18.360,00:05:19.880,What?
00:05:18.360,00:05:22.760,But-- Where is the snow?
00:05:24.240,00:05:26.440,Nanny Plum!
00:05:26.440,00:05:29.480,It's snowing inside.
00:05:30.720,00:05:32.680,DAISY &amp; POPPY: Snow! Snow!
00:05:36.960,00:05:38.920,Ooh! Nanny Plum!
00:05:41.360,00:05:42.880,Is this your doing?
00:05:42.880,00:05:44.600,"Yes, it is."
00:05:44.600,00:05:47.920,Inside is for sitting in armchairs and reading.
00:05:53.560,00:05:56.280,"Nanny Plum, you're fired."
00:05:56.280,00:05:58.360,Heh. Don't be silly.
00:05:58.360,00:06:02.560,I'm taking away your wand until you learn how to control your spells better!
00:06:02.560,00:06:04.120,But what about the snow?
00:06:04.120,00:06:05.440,Not another word!
00:06:05.440,00:06:07.320,ALL: Aw.
00:06:07.320,00:06:08.960,Everyone out!
00:06:11.800,00:06:15.440,Now Daddy's taken Nanny Plum's wand.
00:06:15.440,00:06:18.240,She won't be able to magic any snow.
00:06:18.240,00:06:21.200,Now we won't have any snow for Christmas.
00:06:21.200,00:06:24.680,There's always a chance it might snow anyway.
00:06:26.080,00:06:28.080,I can hear something.
00:06:28.080,00:06:29.480,Is it snow?
00:06:29.480,00:06:32.200,No. It's the elf plane.
00:06:32.200,00:06:35.520,Dad's back from the North Pole.
00:06:43.960,00:06:46.560,That's the last delivery done.
00:06:46.560,00:06:48.720,"Dad, did you see snow?"
00:06:50.240,00:06:53.120,Enough snow to last me a lifetime.
00:06:53.120,00:06:57.480,"Now you've finished your work, Mr. Elf, are you on holiday?"
00:06:57.480,00:07:00.440,"Holiday? Good gracious, no."
00:07:00.440,00:07:02.200,It's Christmas Eve.
00:07:02.200,00:07:05.920,There's work to be done preparing tonight's Elf and Fairy Feast.
00:07:05.920,00:07:09.920,"Oh, yes. The midnight Elf and Fairy Feast."
00:07:09.920,00:07:11.760,BEN: On Christmas Eve.
00:07:11.760,00:07:13.200,VIOLET: With music.
00:07:13.200,00:07:14.440,BARNABY: And singing.
00:07:14.440,00:07:17.040,JAKE: And lanterns.
00:07:17.040,00:07:20.360,Yes. And those lanterns don't hang themselves up.
00:07:20.360,00:07:21.520,To work.
00:07:21.520,00:07:23.400,"MRS. ELF: Stop, Mr. Elf."
00:07:23.400,00:07:25.840,It's about time you had a rest.
00:07:25.840,00:07:27.280,A rest?
00:07:27.280,00:07:30.160,You've been working hard all year.
00:07:30.160,00:07:33.080,Just sit down and relax for five minutes.
00:07:34.320,00:07:36.160,I can give you three.
00:07:36.160,00:07:38.240,You work too hard.
00:07:38.240,00:07:42.680,"Elves like working hard, and I'm an elf."
00:07:44.400,00:07:47.240,"Oh, dear."
00:07:47.240,00:07:50.600,"Just say, I'm on holiday."
00:07:50.600,00:07:52.640,"Well, all right."
00:07:52.640,00:07:55.760,I'm on holiday.
00:07:57.440,00:08:00.120,That's nice.
00:08:02.080,00:08:06.120,"Hello, Wise Old Elf speaking."
00:08:06.120,00:08:07.840,FATHER CHRISTMAS: Ho! Ho! Ho!
00:08:07.840,00:08:10.320,It's Father Christmas here.
00:08:10.320,00:08:12.480,Oh. Mr. Christmas.
00:08:12.480,00:08:15.240,We seem to be missing some toys.
00:08:19.200,00:08:21.520,Box 571?
00:08:21.520,00:08:28.560,"I need those toys before tonight, or some children will not get their Christmas presents."
00:08:28.560,00:08:32.600,"Never fear, Mr. Christmas, we will get the box to you."
00:08:32.600,00:08:36.080,I will deliver it personally.
00:08:36.080,00:08:39.000,Box 571?
00:08:39.000,00:08:40.600,We'll never find it.
00:08:40.600,00:08:42.640,"Is it this box, Dad?"
00:08:42.640,00:08:46.080,The one that says box 571?
00:08:46.080,00:08:47.200,What?
00:08:47.200,00:08:51.160,"Well done, Ben."
00:08:51.160,00:08:52.760,To the elf plane!
00:08:52.760,00:08:54.560,We leave immediately!
00:08:54.560,00:08:57.440,"Well, that was a nice holiday, while it lasted."
00:08:57.440,00:09:00.400,Are you going back to the North Pole?
00:09:00.400,00:09:01.800,Can we come?
00:09:01.800,00:09:03.880,"Can we, Dad? Please?"
00:09:03.880,00:09:05.920,"ALL: Please, Mr. Elf."
00:09:05.920,00:09:09.200,"I don't mind who comes, but we must leave straightaway."
00:09:09.200,00:09:11.320,ALL: Wa-hey! Brilliant!
00:09:11.320,00:09:15.600,"I'll just get my wand back from King Thistle and then-- There's no time for that, Nanny."
00:09:15.600,00:09:19.000,We need to get these toys to Father Christmas right away.
00:09:19.000,00:09:21.800,Elf honor is at stake.
00:09:23.800,00:09:25.480,"Ready for take-off, captain."
00:09:25.480,00:09:27.960,Everyone on board.
00:09:27.960,00:09:29.800,"Ben, it's snowing."
00:09:29.800,00:09:31.240,"Oh, wow!"
00:09:31.240,00:09:32.680,Snow!
00:09:32.680,00:09:36.440,You see? My snow globe is never wrong.
00:09:36.440,00:09:37.720,Hm.
00:09:39.440,00:09:41.440,What do all these buttons do?
00:09:41.440,00:09:45.680,"Don't touch anything, please, Nanny Plum."
00:09:45.680,00:09:47.240,Wind the engine!
00:09:47.240,00:09:49.160,BOTH: Righty-o.
00:09:51.800,00:09:53.120,Ready for take-off!
00:10:03.640,00:10:06.160,North Pole here we come!
00:10:06.160,00:10:09.160,I can't wait to play in the snow.
00:10:09.160,00:10:10.720,KIDS: Me too!
00:10:10.720,00:10:12.840,We're not going to play in the snow.
00:10:12.840,00:10:16.120,We're just dropping off the toy box and coming straight home.
00:10:18.760,00:10:20.640,"Goodness gracious, no."
00:10:20.640,00:10:21.960,We're on a mission.
00:10:21.960,00:10:26.880,There'll be no playing in the snow and no meeting Father Christmas.
00:10:26.880,00:10:36.840,NARRATOR: Join us in our next episode when we play in the snow and meet Father Christmas.
00:10:38.640,00:10:45.200,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts on Christmas Eve.
00:10:49.880,00:10:51.960,Are we nearly there yet?
00:10:51.960,00:10:55.520,"Yes, Nanny."
00:10:55.520,00:10:58.200,Will we meet Father Christmas?
00:10:58.200,00:10:59.440,"No, Holly."
00:11:02.440,00:11:05.200,We drop the toys by parachute.
00:11:05.200,00:11:07.560,Does Father Christmas catch them?
00:11:07.560,00:11:10.800,No.
00:11:07.560,00:11:12.000,The toys are collected by-- Goblins.
00:11:12.000,00:11:16.040,Not goblins. Arctic elves.
00:11:16.040,00:11:18.880,"Goblins, pixies. Whatever."
00:11:18.880,00:11:21.280,My brother is an Arctic elf.
00:11:21.280,00:11:23.160,I didn't know you had a brother.
00:11:23.160,00:11:27.400,"Oh, yes. He's in charge of the Arctic elves."
00:11:27.400,00:11:32.640,Calling Arctic elves.
00:11:32.640,00:11:37.080,"ARCTIC ELF: Receiving you loud and clear, Flight 1001."
00:11:37.080,00:11:39.240,Please drop the toys.
00:11:39.240,00:11:41.800,Righty-o!
00:11:43.120,00:11:44.760,MR. ELF: Toys away!
00:11:48.040,00:11:49.640,Now we can go home.
00:11:49.640,00:11:53.040,It's a shame we never met Father Christmas.
00:11:53.040,00:11:55.040,Or the Arctic elves.
00:11:55.040,00:11:58.840,The good thing is we'll be back in time for the Elf and Fairy Feast.
00:11:58.840,00:12:01.520,"Oh, yes."
00:12:01.520,00:12:03.200,At midnight.
00:12:03.200,00:12:04.600,With dancing.
00:12:04.600,00:12:06.560,And lanterns.
00:12:08.120,00:12:11.360,"Oh, dear. The elf plane sounds a bit odd."
00:12:11.360,00:12:12.720,Is it broken?
00:12:12.720,00:12:14.160,Of course not.
00:12:14.160,00:12:18.680,This plane is built to last one thousand flights.
00:12:18.680,00:12:20.680,Oh. Uh...
00:12:20.680,00:12:23.520,This is Flight 1001.
00:12:23.520,00:12:24.880,"Oh, look."
00:12:24.880,00:12:28.800,Lots of cogs and things are falling out?
00:12:30.120,00:12:31.440,Uh-oh.
00:12:31.440,00:12:33.200,We're going down!
00:12:33.200,00:12:35.360,ALL: Whoa!
00:12:39.040,00:12:42.280,Phew. We landed safely.
00:12:42.280,00:12:43.800,That was lucky.
00:12:43.800,00:12:47.040,Lucky?
00:12:47.040,00:12:49.960,But now we might meet Father Christmas.
00:12:49.960,00:12:51.600,And the Arctic elves.
00:12:51.600,00:12:54.320,I suppose we might see some penguins.
00:12:54.320,00:12:56.440,"Ah, I like penguins."
00:12:56.440,00:12:59.160,Penguins live at the South Pole.
00:12:59.160,00:13:01.120,This is the North Pole.
00:13:01.120,00:13:03.160,What's that waddling towards us then?
00:13:03.160,00:13:05.320,ALL: Penguins!
00:13:05.320,00:13:07.280,Not penguins.
00:13:07.280,00:13:09.320,Arctic elves.
00:13:09.320,00:13:11.640,It's my twin brother.
00:13:11.640,00:13:15.040,"Hello, little brother."
00:13:15.040,00:13:18.320,Are you really as old as each other?
00:13:18.320,00:13:20.760,No. I'm older.
00:13:20.760,00:13:22.320,But you're twins.
00:13:22.320,00:13:26.760,I'm older and wiser by three minutes.
00:13:26.760,00:13:28.840,Hardly older at all.
00:13:28.840,00:13:31.880,I am the Wiser Older Elf.
00:13:31.880,00:13:33.280,Bah!
00:13:33.280,00:13:40.160,"When you little boys have stopped squabbling, maybe the wisest person here can work out how we get back home."
00:13:40.160,00:13:42.040,Oh.
00:13:42.040,00:13:45.360,Maybe Father Christmas could help.
00:13:47.200,00:13:49.160,"Follow me, everyone."
00:13:49.160,00:13:51.520,To the house of Father Christmas.
00:13:51.520,00:13:53.520,ALL: Father Christmas.
00:13:59.640,00:14:03.840,"Maybe if you're lucky, Nanny Plum, you'll see a penguin."
00:14:05.000,00:14:07.520,"Violet, can I borrow your wand?"
00:14:07.520,00:14:09.560,Okay.
00:14:12.000,00:14:14.760,"Oh, look, Wise Old Elf."
00:14:19.240,00:14:21.040,What?
00:14:23.600,00:14:26.640,Ooh.
00:14:26.640,00:14:30.400,Interesting.
00:14:30.400,00:14:31.920,"ALL: Oh, no!"
00:14:31.920,00:14:36.040,We need to get the ladybird somewhere warm.
00:14:36.040,00:14:39.640,"Yes, insects don't like the winter."
00:14:39.640,00:14:44.200,Here we are.
00:14:44.200,00:14:47.400,HOLLY: It looks like a Christmas pudding.
00:14:47.400,00:14:48.680,"Oh, wonderful."
00:14:48.680,00:14:52.480,"Yes, little brother."
00:14:52.480,00:14:57.320,"Well, when I said wonderful, I meant it's okay."
00:15:00.240,00:15:03.600,This is Father Christmas' study.
00:15:08.280,00:15:10.760,Are these Father Christmas' slippers?
00:15:10.760,00:15:12.560,"Yes, they are."
00:15:12.560,00:15:16.080,Wow! His feet are bigger than all of us.
00:15:16.080,00:15:19.120,I think Gaston is thawing out.
00:15:19.120,00:15:21.320,Gaston's back.
00:15:23.040,00:15:26.880,Box 571 delivered.
00:15:26.880,00:15:28.640,"Oh, thank you, little brother."
00:15:28.640,00:15:36.120,"It would be simply spiffing if next year, you made the last toy delivery before Christmas Eve."
00:15:36.120,00:15:39.200,What?
00:15:39.200,00:15:40.720,You just wrap them up.
00:15:40.720,00:15:44.920,Ah! But wrapping toys is the important bit.
00:15:44.920,00:15:50.000,You have to be as old and wise as me to understand that.
00:15:50.000,00:15:52.080,You're no wiser than me.
00:15:52.080,00:15:54.680,But I am. By three minutes.
00:15:56.160,00:16:02.280,"Talking of wrapping presents, shouldn't somebody be doing that by now?"
00:16:02.280,00:16:03.720,It's Christmas Eve.
00:16:03.720,00:16:05.680,"Goodness me, you're right."
00:16:05.680,00:16:09.200,To the present-wrapping machines.
00:16:18.560,00:16:21.920,That's the last of this year's presents wrapped.
00:16:21.920,00:16:23.280,Time for a holiday.
00:16:23.280,00:16:24.920,ALL: Hoorah!
00:16:24.920,00:16:28.920,"Uh, we've just brought one more box of toys to wrap."
00:16:28.920,00:16:31.280,Sorry to end your holiday.
00:16:31.280,00:16:32.800,That's okay.
00:16:32.800,00:16:36.080,Arctic elves love wrapping presents. And we're...
00:16:37.240,00:16:38.800,ALL: Arctic elves!
00:16:47.400,00:16:48.760,Not bad.
00:16:48.760,00:16:51.880,"You've done a good job, brother."
00:16:51.880,00:16:54.600,"Oh. Thank you, brother."
00:16:54.600,00:16:57.960,"When the presents are wrapped up, who delivers them?"
00:16:57.960,00:17:02.200,Ho-ho-ho!
00:17:02.200,00:17:04.600,ALL: Father Christmas.
00:17:04.600,00:17:06.440,Call me Santa.
00:17:06.440,00:17:09.000,I hear you're in a spot of bother.
00:17:09.000,00:17:11.840,Yes. We need some help getting home.
00:17:11.840,00:17:14.160,I've got some work to do tonight.
00:17:14.160,00:17:16.320,I could drop you off on the way.
00:17:16.320,00:17:17.840,Are you going our way?
00:17:17.840,00:17:20.880,I'm going every way.
00:17:20.880,00:17:22.480,ALL: Yay!
00:17:22.480,00:17:26.480,I say! That penguin's a long way from home.
00:17:26.480,00:17:28.640,I'd better drop him off too.
00:17:30.080,00:17:34.080,Ho-ho-ho! Away we go!
00:17:37.040,00:17:40.160,Have you got a present for our friend Lucy?
00:17:40.160,00:17:41.680,Lucy?
00:17:41.680,00:17:43.600,HOLLY: She's a little girl we know.
00:17:43.600,00:17:46.400,FATHER CHRISTMAS: Of course there's a present for her.
00:17:51.200,00:17:55.880,Hm. Why do people always have such small chimneys?
00:17:55.880,00:17:58.600,We could deliver the presents for you.
00:17:58.600,00:18:00.600,All right.
00:18:00.600,00:18:04.120,Put these presents in Lucy's Christmas stocking.
00:18:07.120,00:18:09.800,Don't forget the tangerine.
00:18:14.400,00:18:16.360,JAKE: Someone's coming.
00:18:16.360,00:18:19.840,Keep still.
00:18:20.840,00:18:22.400,MAN: That's odd.
00:18:22.400,00:18:26.080,Some of the decorations have fallen off the tree.
00:18:26.080,00:18:29.600,This little elf must go here.
00:18:29.600,00:18:33.600,And this pretty fairy should be at the top of the tree.
00:18:35.720,00:18:37.040,ALL: Phew.
00:18:37.040,00:18:39.240,That was really close.
00:18:39.240,00:18:42.120,Let's deliver Lucy's presents.
00:18:52.680,00:18:54.600,Ben! Holly!
00:18:57.880,00:19:00.480,I'm too excited about Christmas.
00:19:00.480,00:19:02.120,What are you doing here?
00:19:02.120,00:19:05.080,We're delivering your Christmas presents.
00:19:09.560,00:19:13.520,"No, but tonight we have the Elf and Fairy Feast."
00:19:13.520,00:19:15.400,STRAWBERRY: There's lovely music.
00:19:15.400,00:19:18.000,BARNABY: And lanterns in the trees.
00:19:19.600,00:19:21.280,It's beautiful.
00:19:21.280,00:19:24.760,We'd better go.
00:19:24.760,00:19:28.600,Santa?
00:19:31.000,00:19:33.000,Merry Christmas.
00:19:33.000,00:19:35.920,"Ah, there you are."
00:19:35.920,00:19:41.520,"Uh, there wasn't a little snack down there for old Santa, was there?"
00:19:41.520,00:19:44.240,"Yes, a mince pie."
00:19:44.240,00:19:45.560,Delicious.
00:19:53.200,00:19:57.880,We can't start the Elf and Fairy Feast until the others are back.
00:19:57.880,00:19:59.760,"Well, where are they?"
00:19:59.760,00:20:01.800,Ho-ho-ho!
00:20:01.800,00:20:04.440,"Hello, everyone. We're back."
00:20:04.440,00:20:08.280,Father Christmas gave us a lift on his sleigh.
00:20:08.280,00:20:10.320,"QUEEN: Thank you, Father Christmas."
00:20:10.320,00:20:13.600,Would you like to stay for our Elf and Fairy Feast?
00:20:13.600,00:20:15.400,"No time, I'm afraid."
00:20:15.400,00:20:19.960,I have to deliver presents to all the children of the world.
00:20:19.960,00:20:22.080,How many deliveries have you done so far?
00:20:24.600,00:20:28.120,Thank you. Merry Christmas!
00:20:30.040,00:20:34.320,"Good. Now we're all here, Christmas can begin."
00:20:34.320,00:20:35.600,ALL: Hooray!
00:00:15.200,00:00:16.600,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:18.160,00:00:21.040,And I'm Princess Holly.
00:00:22.320,00:00:24.240,"Come on, let's play."
00:00:35.640,00:00:42.120,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:00:46.760,00:00:51.840,"But the witch had eaten too much cake, and fallen asleep."
00:00:51.840,00:01:06.680,"So the fairy tiptoed past the sleeping cat, waved her wand, 'Abracadroo, abracadee Unfreeze the children And set them all free' And in a flash, the witch's spell was undone."
00:01:06.680,00:01:15.240,"As the sun came up and the stars went away, all of the children found themselves safely back in their beds."
00:01:15.240,00:01:16.640,The end.
00:01:16.640,00:01:20.560,"Mommy, why did the witch freeze all the children?"
00:01:20.560,00:01:22.840,Oh. I don't know.
00:01:22.840,00:01:27.920,"Maybe the witch didn't like the noise the children made, and just happened to know a spell for freezing them."
00:01:27.920,00:01:30.960,"Yes, thank you, Nanny Plum."
00:01:30.960,00:01:37.120,Not eating for a year and a day must have made the children very hungry.
00:01:37.120,00:01:41.680,"No. The witch had frozen them solid, like frozen peas."
00:01:41.680,00:01:44.640,"Now frozen peas don't get hungry, do they?"
00:01:44.640,00:01:46.160,KIDS: No.
00:01:46.160,00:01:49.680,"Queen Thistle, where do the stars go in the daytime?"
00:01:49.680,00:01:51.440,"I'm sorry, Ben?"
00:01:51.440,00:01:55.480,You said the sun came up and the stars went away.
00:01:55.480,00:01:58.080,But where did the stars go?
00:01:58.080,00:02:01.680,"Uh, well, let's see what the book says."
00:02:01.680,00:02:05.640,Hm. It doesn't say where the stars went.
00:02:05.640,00:02:10.040,"Nanny Plum, do you know where the stars go in the daytime?"
00:02:10.040,00:02:12.720,Uh... No.
00:02:12.720,00:02:14.040,BEN &amp; HOLLY: Oh.
00:02:14.040,00:02:19.560,"Perhaps we should ask King Thistle, he knows how the world works."
00:02:19.560,00:02:22.560,Yes. Let's go and ask Daddy.
00:02:35.240,00:02:37.240,"Daddy, Daddy."
00:02:37.240,00:02:39.040,Can we ask you a question?
00:02:39.040,00:02:41.760,"Yes, of course, Holly."
00:02:41.760,00:02:45.320,Can you tell us where the stars go in the daytime?
00:02:45.320,00:02:47.400,Ha-ha-ha. What?
00:02:47.400,00:02:50.760,Where do the stars go when the sun comes up?
00:02:50.760,00:02:53.800,"Well, they go-- Yes, they go... Heh."
00:02:53.800,00:02:56.560,"Uh, I'm actually rather busy at the moment, Holly."
00:02:56.560,00:02:59.440,Our storybook said the stars went away.
00:02:59.440,00:03:02.320,But it didn't say where they went.
00:03:02.320,00:03:05.120,"Oh, I see. Well..."
00:03:05.120,00:03:08.280,There are plenty of books in the Royal Library.
00:03:08.280,00:03:10.640,One of them might have the answer.
00:03:10.640,00:03:12.400,"Good idea, Queen Thistle."
00:03:12.400,00:03:13.480,"Come on, everyone."
00:03:17.000,00:03:20.320,Wow.
00:03:20.320,00:03:23.440,That's because these are magic books.
00:03:23.440,00:03:26.360,You are very naughty books.
00:03:26.360,00:03:28.520,Flying about and fidgeting.
00:03:28.520,00:03:31.680,Chop-chop.
00:03:32.680,00:03:37.360,"A, B, C, neatly please."
00:03:37.360,00:03:39.640,How do we find what we're looking for?
00:03:39.640,00:03:43.840,These are magic books.
00:03:43.840,00:03:45.680,"Excuse me, books."
00:03:45.680,00:03:50.200,Where do the stars go in the daytime?
00:03:50.200,00:03:54.840,Do you have anything about stars at all?
00:03:58.400,00:04:01.440,Look at all the fancy writing.
00:04:01.440,00:04:03.120,What does it say?
00:04:03.120,00:04:06.000,Has it got the answer?
00:04:03.120,00:04:15.680,"It says, Little Star, we ask you to make our wishes all come true Oh. It's just a spell for wishing on a star."
00:04:15.680,00:04:16.920,BEN &amp; HOLLY: Oh.
00:04:16.920,00:04:19.320,Oh.
00:04:16.920,00:04:23.120,"I think these magic books are only for making spells, not for answering questions."
00:04:23.120,00:04:26.880,"But, Nanny, why don't you know the answer?"
00:04:26.880,00:04:30.200,I'm Nanny Plum.
00:04:30.200,00:04:33.800,Astro-fizzle-sist?
00:04:33.800,00:04:39.360,"Oh, just someone who knows a lot about stars and space and things."
00:04:39.360,00:04:42.280,Elves know a lot about things.
00:04:42.280,00:04:44.360,We could ask my mom and dad.
00:04:44.360,00:04:48.520,Are your mom and dad astro-fizzle-sists?
00:04:48.520,00:04:51.840,"Uh, maybe. Let's go and see."
00:05:02.440,00:05:04.440,ALL: Hello.
00:05:04.440,00:05:08.520,"Mom, Dad, are you astro-fizzle-sists?"
00:05:08.520,00:05:11.560,BOTH: No. We're elves.
00:05:12.920,00:05:15.640,Do you know where the stars go in the daytime?
00:05:15.640,00:05:17.600,BOTH: Uh... No.
00:05:17.600,00:05:20.400,Nobody knows the answer.
00:05:20.400,00:05:23.800,Maybe we could ask the Wise Old Elf.
00:05:23.800,00:05:26.160,Yes. He's wise.
00:05:26.160,00:05:27.320,He's old.
00:05:27.320,00:05:29.720,ALL: And he's an elf.
00:05:45.800,00:05:47.240,Enter.
00:05:47.240,00:05:48.480,ALL: Hello.
00:05:48.480,00:05:51.160,"Good afternoon, everybody."
00:05:51.160,00:05:52.960,How can I help you?
00:05:52.960,00:05:56.480,"Wise Old Elf, we have a question."
00:05:56.480,00:05:58.840,The answer wasn't in our storybook.
00:05:58.840,00:06:02.240,"It's an elf question, not really a fairy matter."
00:06:02.240,00:06:06.880,"So we thought, as you are the Wise Old Elf..."
00:06:08.680,00:06:12.880,Ask me any question.
00:06:15.080,00:06:18.920,Where do the stars go in the daytime?
00:06:18.920,00:06:22.280,Uh-- Ask me another question.
00:06:22.280,00:06:25.680,"On sport, perhaps."
00:06:28.240,00:06:29.800,You're just old.
00:06:29.800,00:06:33.440,"So, Old Elf, you don't know the answer?"
00:06:33.440,00:06:35.280,Uh... No.
00:06:38.520,00:06:40.920,Where?
00:06:42.840,00:06:44.280,Is it far?
00:06:44.280,00:06:47.920,All of this searching for answers has made me a bit tired.
00:06:47.920,00:06:49.520,We can take the lift.
00:07:01.160,00:07:03.400,Where are we going?
00:07:03.400,00:07:08.480,We are going to the Great Elf Library.
00:07:08.480,00:07:11.120,Great Elf Library indeed.
00:07:11.120,00:07:14.000,It's probably just a dusty old cupboard.
00:07:17.680,00:07:21.360,Shh. This is a library.
00:07:21.360,00:07:23.480,We must be quiet.
00:07:23.480,00:07:27.480,HOLLY: Wow. It's huge.
00:07:27.480,00:07:29.880,KING: There are so many books here.
00:07:29.880,00:07:32.960,How do you stop them flying about and fidgeting?
00:07:32.960,00:07:37.120,"These are not magic books, Your Majesty."
00:07:37.120,00:07:40.480,"Oh. Well, how do you ever find what you are looking for then?"
00:07:40.480,00:07:45.360,We ask the wise old librarian.
00:07:45.360,00:07:50.120,So where is this wise old librarian?
00:07:51.960,00:07:53.560,Can I help you?
00:07:53.560,00:07:55.840,Are you the librarian?
00:07:55.840,00:07:58.320,Yes.
00:07:58.320,00:08:01.640,Do you know where the stars go in the daytime?
00:08:04.280,00:08:05.560,Yes.
00:08:05.560,00:08:13.000,"The answer is in the astrophysics section, second row, reference 520.34."
00:08:13.000,00:08:14.400,This way.
00:08:14.400,00:08:17.560,But we already looked in books for the answer.
00:08:17.560,00:08:20.120,What books did you look in?
00:08:20.120,00:08:22.360,We looked in my storybook.
00:08:22.360,00:08:25.200,And we looked in magic spellbooks.
00:08:25.200,00:08:29.720,"Well, there are different books for different things."
00:08:29.720,00:08:32.200,There are books with stories in...
00:08:32.200,00:08:35.600,"Ooh. Look, witches."
00:08:35.600,00:08:38.360,And books about how things work.
00:08:40.360,00:08:43.320,There are books about music.
00:08:47.960,00:08:49.800,Books about animals.
00:08:49.800,00:08:52.560,"Oh, chickens."
00:08:52.560,00:08:54.880,Books about vegetables.
00:08:54.880,00:08:56.840,"Oh, yes, I like vegetables."
00:08:56.840,00:08:58.480,Especially peas.
00:08:58.480,00:09:03.520,You can find out any answer if you look in the right book.
00:09:03.520,00:09:05.840,Ah. Here we are.
00:09:05.840,00:09:08.400,A book on stars.
00:09:08.400,00:09:10.320,Is this going to have the answer?
00:09:10.320,00:09:12.000,Let's see.
00:09:12.000,00:09:13.680,Is everybody comfortable?
00:09:13.680,00:09:16.320,"Yes, Queen Thistle."
00:09:16.320,00:09:21.560,"On clear nights, we can see the stars twinkling in the sky."
00:09:21.560,00:09:27.760,"The light we see from each star is tiny, the tiniest little spot of light."
00:09:27.760,00:09:31.280,We can only see it because the sky is so dark.
00:09:31.280,00:09:35.280,Black.
00:09:35.280,00:09:37.320,"Yes, it is, Holly."
00:09:37.320,00:09:43.920,"But when the morning comes, and the sun rises, the sky gets brighter and the stars disappear."
00:09:43.920,00:09:47.360,"But, Mommy, where do the stars go?"
00:09:47.360,00:09:49.680,They don't go anywhere.
00:09:49.680,00:09:50.960,What?
00:09:50.960,00:09:53.200,They're still shining in the sky.
00:09:53.200,00:09:56.680,We just can't see them anymore because the sky is so bright.
00:09:56.680,00:10:00.240,It's obvious.
00:10:07.520,00:10:09.560,When the sun goes.
00:10:09.560,00:10:10.840,Of course.
00:10:10.840,00:10:15.480,"So, Daddy, where does the sun go?"
00:10:15.480,00:10:16.720,"Well, it..."
00:10:16.720,00:10:19.120,Ah. Wise Old Elf?
00:10:20.600,00:10:25.720,"These books should answer that question, Your Majesty."
00:10:26.880,00:10:28.280,ALL: Hooray!
00:10:28.280,00:10:29.840,Shh.
00:10:29.840,00:10:32.800,This is a library.
00:10:32.800,00:10:35.200,We must be quiet.
00:10:35.200,00:10:38.240,Hooray.
00:10:38.240,00:10:44.560,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the meadow.
00:10:50.360,00:10:51.520,"To you, Gaston."
00:10:53.600,00:10:55.400,"To you, Ben."
00:10:57.760,00:11:00.560,"To you, Bobby Bee."
00:11:08.680,00:11:09.880,Who are you?
00:11:12.200,00:11:15.080,It's a caterpillar.
00:11:15.080,00:11:16.600,Hello.
00:11:17.920,00:11:20.880,"Ben, can you speak Caterpillar language?"
00:11:20.880,00:11:23.040,"Um, not really."
00:11:24.280,00:11:27.000,"It sounds like she's saying, Betty."
00:11:27.000,00:11:29.120,"Ha, ha. Hello, Betty."
00:11:30.280,00:11:36.520,"We're playing with our friends Gaston the Ladybird, and Bobby Bee."
00:11:36.520,00:11:38.640,Would you like to play too?
00:11:40.200,00:11:42.960,That must mean yes.
00:11:42.960,00:11:45.240,"Um, let's play racing."
00:11:45.240,00:11:48.280,Fastest across the meadow is the winner.
00:11:48.280,00:11:49.880,Can we fly?
00:11:49.880,00:11:52.840,"No flying, and no magic."
00:11:52.840,00:11:54.000,Okay.
00:11:56.840,00:11:58.120,Ready...
00:11:58.120,00:11:59.720,steady...
00:11:59.720,00:12:01.320,Go!
00:12:04.480,00:12:06.400,Wow!
00:12:06.400,00:12:09.120,Look at Betty go.
00:12:17.200,00:12:20.400,"Wow! Well done, Betty."
00:12:21.720,00:12:25.040,How about Gaston showing us some tricks?
00:12:25.040,00:12:28.440,"Good idea, Ben."
00:12:45.960,00:12:47.280,HOLLY: Look.
00:12:47.280,00:12:50.360,Betty Caterpillar is sad.
00:12:52.240,00:12:54.720,I think she feels a bit left out.
00:13:00.720,00:13:02.680,I know how to cheer her up.
00:13:05.320,00:13:07.680,"Don't be sad, Betty."
00:13:07.680,00:13:09.960,Flying isn't everything.
00:13:09.960,00:13:13.720,"Elves can't fly, and I'm an elf."
00:13:17.200,00:13:19.200,That didn't cheer her up much.
00:13:21.280,00:13:24.560,Maybe I can make her fly by magic.
00:13:24.560,00:13:26.040,Can you do that?
00:13:26.040,00:13:28.040,"Um, I think so."
00:13:29.520,00:13:39.440,"Abracadabra Fly, Betty, fly Wow! It worked."
00:13:43.880,00:13:46.800,Oh. I didn't expect that to happen.
00:13:48.480,00:13:51.720,We need to rescue her.
00:13:51.720,00:13:53.400,I could do another spell.
00:14:00.600,00:14:01.840,Yahoo!
00:14:01.840,00:14:03.880,"Whoa! Steady, Betty."
00:14:03.880,00:14:05.640,"Whoa, whoa!"
00:14:09.320,00:14:11.480,BEN: Aah!
00:14:17.120,00:14:18.480,"Hello, Holly."
00:14:18.480,00:14:20.160,"Oh. Hello, Daddy."
00:14:20.160,00:14:22.600,BEN: Whoa!
00:14:22.600,00:14:24.480,What on earth is going on?
00:14:24.480,00:14:27.480,"Uh, Ben's in a spot of bother."
00:14:27.480,00:14:29.040,Whoa! Help!
00:14:29.040,00:14:31.200,"Ah, I see."
00:14:31.200,00:14:33.080,Help! Help!
00:14:43.160,00:14:45.880,We were just trying to help her.
00:14:45.880,00:14:49.120,Betty's sad that she can't fly.
00:14:49.120,00:14:52.200,I see.
00:14:52.200,00:14:54.480,She'll be flying soon enough on her own.
00:14:54.480,00:14:55.880,How?
00:14:55.880,00:14:58.040,"Well, because she's one of those..."
00:14:58.040,00:15:00.160,"Uh, insect things."
00:15:01.600,00:15:03.000,"KING: Thank you, Ben."
00:15:03.000,00:15:05.640,"Yes, a caterpillar."
00:15:05.640,00:15:07.360,"And they change, don't they?"
00:15:07.360,00:15:08.720,Do they?
00:15:08.720,00:15:10.320,Of course they do.
00:15:10.320,00:15:12.320,So you've nothing to worry about.
00:15:14.600,00:15:18.680,"If you want to help, you can find her some leaves to eat."
00:15:20.840,00:15:25.560,"So if we want to help her fly, we have to find more leaves?"
00:15:26.880,00:15:30.200,She needs to eat lots and lots of leaves.
00:15:30.200,00:15:32.320,Why?
00:15:32.320,00:15:34.440,"First, gather up the leaves."
00:15:34.440,00:15:38.120,Okay. Let's see who can get the most leaves.
00:15:38.120,00:15:40.520,"Okay, you're on."
00:15:59.720,00:16:03.640,Oh. Do you think we fed Betty too many leaves?
00:16:03.640,00:16:08.040,"Yes, she's a tiny bit fat."
00:16:08.040,00:16:12.680,There's no way she'll ever fly.
00:16:12.680,00:16:14.280,That's better.
00:16:14.280,00:16:16.000,She's a good weight now.
00:16:16.000,00:16:20.000,"Uh, Daddy, how can this help Betty fly?"
00:16:20.000,00:16:22.200,"Ha, ha. You'll see."
00:16:25.760,00:16:27.840,Home time!
00:16:27.840,00:16:31.240,Ah. That's Nanny Plum calling me in.
00:16:33.080,00:16:35.480,Ben! Home time!
00:16:37.360,00:16:38.720,See you tomorrow.
00:16:38.720,00:16:41.200,"See you tomorrow, Ben."
00:16:41.200,00:16:43.680,"Goodnight, Betty."
00:17:00.600,00:17:06.880,"HOLLY: Daddy told us to feed Betty, but now she's so big she'll never fly."
00:17:06.880,00:17:09.040,Daddy must be wrong.
00:17:09.040,00:17:11.560,"Holly, Daddy's never wrong."
00:17:11.560,00:17:15.840,"He's a king, and he's very, uh, wise."
00:17:15.840,00:17:18.280,But how will Betty fly?
00:17:20.200,00:17:21.600,"Good night, Holly."
00:17:21.600,00:17:23.360,"Goodnight, Mommy."
00:17:30.240,00:17:35.640,"Well, she won't exactly be a caterpillar anymore."
00:17:35.640,00:17:37.560,"Uh, I don't get it."
00:17:37.560,00:17:40.280,You will tomorrow.
00:17:45.080,00:17:47.080,Morning time.
00:17:52.360,00:17:54.800,Ben! Ben!
00:17:57.760,00:17:59.200,Holly!
00:18:05.320,00:18:07.720,"Hi, Ben."
00:18:07.720,00:18:10.200,Oh. Where's Betty?
00:18:10.200,00:18:13.320,"Um, I don't know."
00:18:13.320,00:18:16.000,Ugh. What is it?
00:18:16.000,00:18:18.480,"Don't know, but it wasn't here yesterday."
00:18:18.480,00:18:19.720,BOTH: Hiya.
00:18:19.720,00:18:22.200,"Hi, Violet. Hi, Strawberry."
00:18:22.200,00:18:24.640,Ugh. What's that?
00:18:24.640,00:18:25.840,We don't know.
00:18:25.840,00:18:27.400,It's a cocoon.
00:18:27.400,00:18:29.240,Caterpillars make them.
00:18:29.240,00:18:32.920,So is Betty Caterpillar inside?
00:18:32.920,00:18:38.400,"Yes, but when she comes out, she won't be a caterpillar anymore."
00:18:38.400,00:18:39.760,What will she be?
00:18:42.200,00:18:43.560,A frog?
00:18:43.560,00:18:45.400,Or maybe a bird.
00:18:45.400,00:18:51.160,"I see. Betty Caterpillar's going to turn into a bird, then she'll fly."
00:18:54.720,00:18:57.000,"Ah, a cocoon."
00:18:57.000,00:18:58.160,"Yes, Daddy."
00:18:58.160,00:19:00.800,Betty Caterpillar is inside it.
00:19:00.800,00:19:04.320,"And when she comes out, she'll be able to fly."
00:19:04.320,00:19:07.320,Because she'll be a bird.
00:19:07.320,00:19:12.960,"Uh... Actually, caterpillars don't normally change into birds."
00:19:12.960,00:19:15.360,Do they change into frogs?
00:19:15.360,00:19:18.080,"Um, not frogs either."
00:19:24.440,00:19:26.160,"Hello, Betty."
00:19:26.160,00:19:28.680,Oh. She looks the same.
00:19:33.840,00:19:35.760,She's got wings.
00:19:37.760,00:19:40.440,Wow! She's a butterfly.
00:19:40.440,00:19:43.040,ALL: Betty Butterfly.
00:19:43.040,00:19:44.440,Whee!
00:19:48.040,00:19:50.080,"Look, they're all flying together."
00:19:54.080,00:19:55.680,She looks really happy.
00:20:02.760,00:20:05.000,Now everyone can fly.
00:20:05.000,00:20:08.440,I can't fly.
00:20:08.440,00:20:13.800,"Uh, Ben, I thought elves were rather good at using ladybirds to fly?"
00:20:13.800,00:20:15.000,That's right.
00:20:15.000,00:20:17.880,Elves can fly on ladybirds.
00:20:17.880,00:20:19.600,And I'm an elf.
00:20:20.760,00:20:22.120,Gaston.
00:20:23.920,00:20:26.840,"Thanks, Gaston."
00:20:28.360,00:20:29.960,Yee-haw!
00:20:33.920,00:20:35.200,Whee!
00:20:35.200,00:20:37.240,HOLLY: Betty Butterfly.
00:00:10.240,00:00:15.160,"Everyone who lives here is very, very small."
00:00:15.160,00:00:18.280,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:18.280,00:00:21.240,And I'm Princess Holly.
00:00:24.280,00:00:26.480,Wait for us.
00:00:37.120,00:00:43.960,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:00:47.120,00:00:52.000,"Children, your mother and I are going away for the day on royal business."
00:00:52.000,00:00:56.480,Which means you will be at home alone with Nanny Plum.
00:00:56.480,00:00:57.800,ALL: Ooh.
00:00:57.800,00:01:00.240,"Everything will be fine, Your Majesty."
00:01:00.240,00:01:03.080,So no funny business.
00:01:03.080,00:01:07.840,I don't want to come home to find the kingdom covered in frogs or jelly or anything.
00:01:09.640,00:01:14.880,"KING: Because while we're away, you represent King and Queen Thistle."
00:01:14.880,00:01:17.360,Does that mean I can be queen?
00:01:17.360,00:01:20.840,"Ha, ha."
00:01:20.840,00:01:24.040,Just for today.
00:01:26.200,00:01:29.480,"Magic car, drive on."
00:01:29.480,00:01:31.600,BOTH: Bye.
00:01:31.600,00:01:34.600,Bye-bye. Ha-ha-ha.
00:01:34.600,00:01:37.280,Queen Holly.
00:01:37.280,00:01:41.320,Hm.
00:01:41.320,00:01:44.280,Ahem. Hello.
00:01:44.280,00:01:46.280,I'm Queen Holly.
00:01:50.080,00:01:51.400,"Oh. Hello, Ben."
00:01:51.400,00:01:54.800,"Hello, Nanny Plum."
00:01:54.800,00:01:58.320,I'm afraid Holly's much too busy to play today.
00:01:58.320,00:01:59.560,She has a kingdom to run.
00:02:01.560,00:02:03.920,Come up here. Quick.
00:02:03.920,00:02:07.560,Okay.
00:02:07.560,00:02:08.800,"Hi, Holly."
00:02:08.800,00:02:12.200,Queen Holly to you.
00:02:19.120,00:02:23.040,Wow.
00:02:26.200,00:02:27.640,Hello.
00:02:27.640,00:02:32.320,"Hello, Nanny Plum, I've come to collect Ben Elf."
00:02:32.320,00:02:35.880,It's time for school.
00:02:32.320,00:02:41.480,"Okay, I'll just-- Nanny. Send the Wise Old Elf up, I'll sort this out."
00:02:41.480,00:02:44.680,"Very well, Your Majesty."
00:02:46.320,00:02:48.760,Enter.
00:02:48.760,00:02:50.800,"Hello, Princess Holly."
00:02:50.800,00:02:54.080,I'm not Princess Holly.
00:02:54.080,00:02:57.640,I am Queen Holly today.
00:02:57.640,00:03:00.480,I've got no time for these fun and games.
00:03:00.480,00:03:02.400,I've come to collect Ben for school.
00:03:02.400,00:03:04.560,Oh.
00:03:04.560,00:03:05.880,"Wait, Ben."
00:03:12.400,00:03:15.200,"Is this true, Nanny Plum?"
00:03:15.200,00:03:17.040,I'm afraid so.
00:03:17.040,00:03:22.880,And I have just decided that Ben does not have to go to school today.
00:03:22.880,00:03:24.440,It's the law.
00:03:28.520,00:03:32.640,"In fact, they'll be no school for anyone today."
00:03:32.640,00:03:36.120,No school for anyone?
00:03:39.040,00:03:42.440,Because I am Queen Holly.
00:03:42.440,00:03:48.520,"Um, as you wish, Queen Holly."
00:03:50.960,00:03:52.960,"Oh, dear."
00:03:52.960,00:03:57.000,The children will be most upset when they hear the news.
00:04:09.600,00:04:12.120,What's that noise?
00:04:14.920,00:04:16.600,KIDS: No school.
00:04:16.600,00:04:20.200,"Thank you, oh wise Queen Holly."
00:04:20.200,00:04:22.600,"ALL: Hooray, hooray."
00:04:22.600,00:04:27.080,Today shall be a holiday for everyone.
00:04:27.080,00:04:29.160,Even grown-ups.
00:04:29.160,00:04:31.160,Even the Wise Old Elf.
00:04:31.160,00:04:33.920,And Nanny Plum.
00:04:33.920,00:04:38.360,"No one's allowed to work, it's the law."
00:04:38.360,00:04:41.520,But what shall we do all day?
00:04:41.520,00:04:44.920,BOTH: Uh...
00:04:44.920,00:04:50.360,Yes. You've got to play games and be happy.
00:04:50.360,00:04:53.600,Because I am Queen Holly.
00:04:55.720,00:04:59.480,"KIDS: Thank you, Queen Holly."
00:05:01.880,00:05:08.200,"Right, Mr. Elf, next on the list, a delivery of food for the Little Castle."
00:05:08.200,00:05:12.360,"Right-ho, Mrs. Elf."
00:05:12.360,00:05:15.400,Yes.
00:05:15.400,00:05:18.480,BOTH: And we're elves.
00:05:25.240,00:05:28.280,"There's no work today, Mr. Elf."
00:05:28.280,00:05:30.440,It's a holiday.
00:05:30.440,00:05:32.400,"Is this true, Wise Old Elf?"
00:05:34.640,00:05:36.000,I'm afraid so.
00:05:36.000,00:05:40.160,"But I've got an urgent delivery of food, for the Little Castle."
00:05:40.160,00:05:44.120,I suggest you come back tomorrow.
00:05:44.120,00:05:47.080,Righty-ho. Bye.

00:05:55.040,00:05:59.200,ALL: Queen Holly. We're hungry.
00:05:59.200,00:06:04.320,Very well.
00:06:04.320,00:06:08.600,Heh.
00:06:08.600,00:06:12.240,But no one has made any food.
00:06:14.760,00:06:17.000,BOTH: Oh.
00:06:17.000,00:06:24.200,"Queen Holly, if you would allow the elves back to work, we could make everyone lunch."
00:06:24.200,00:06:28.840,"No, no. You all have to have a nice day's holiday."
00:06:34.360,00:06:37.280,"Uh, I'll make food."
00:06:37.280,00:06:38.720,ALL: Hooray.
00:06:38.720,00:06:42.320,Now.

00:06:46.040,00:06:50.480,You shall all eat ice cream.
00:06:50.480,00:06:53.600,"ALL: Hooray. Thank you, Queen Holly."
00:06:56.080,00:06:59.880,Where are we going?
00:06:59.880,00:07:03.640,"We can use Nanny Plum's caldron, to make the ice cream."
00:07:03.640,00:07:07.640,Oh. Are you going to make the ice cream with magic?
00:07:07.640,00:07:09.600,Of course I am.
00:07:09.600,00:07:13.800,"But, Holly, your spells don't always work out quite right."
00:07:13.800,00:07:18.800,Making ice cream is easy peasy. Watch.
00:07:23.000,00:07:31.720,Ice cream for everyone All day long HOLLY: See. It worked.
00:07:31.720,00:07:35.520,Ice creams for everyone.
00:07:35.520,00:07:37.880,"KIDS: Ooh, thank you."
00:07:37.880,00:07:39.680,I'll be back with more.
00:07:42.120,00:07:43.960,"Oh, there's quite a lot."
00:07:45.560,00:07:50.760,"Uh, I think I told it to make ice cream all day long."
00:07:50.760,00:07:52.040,"Oh, dear."
00:07:56.600,00:08:00.200,Ah. We'll soon be home.
00:08:00.200,00:08:05.280,And it's good to see that the kingdom isn't flooded with frogs or jelly or anything.
00:08:05.280,00:08:09.160,Yes. Holly must be behaving herself.
00:08:09.160,00:08:12.680,Aah.
00:08:12.680,00:08:16.160,"Make it stop, Holly."
00:08:16.160,00:08:17.360,Uh...
00:08:17.360,00:08:25.360,"Ziggidy ziggidy zop Stop stop stop Phew, that's better."
00:08:29.560,00:08:32.280,Oi. Where's our ice cream?
00:08:35.680,00:08:37.320,Goodness me.
00:08:46.240,00:08:49.440,"Ah, ah."
00:08:46.240,00:08:51.280,"I did try to stop it, Nanny, but it got worse."
00:08:51.280,00:08:55.400,"Well, thank goodness the King and Queen aren't here to see all this mess."
00:09:07.760,00:09:15.240,"May I be the first to say how pleased we are to see you back again, Your Majesties."
00:09:15.240,00:09:18.720,"While you were away-- Yes, yes."
00:09:18.720,00:09:21.720,"I'm a bit tired, so if you'll excuse me."
00:09:21.720,00:09:23.280,Ah. Stop.
00:09:23.280,00:09:27.080,"Uh, maybe you should go for a little walk, Your Majesty."
00:09:27.080,00:09:30.400,I've just got a bit of tidying up to do inside.
00:09:30.400,00:09:34.520,"Thank you, Nanny Plum, but all I want to do now is have a nice bath."
00:09:34.520,00:09:36.680,Whoa!
00:09:43.120,00:09:45.320,Ah. Ice cream.
00:09:45.320,00:09:49.080,"I'm sorry, Daddy, it's all my fault."
00:09:49.080,00:09:56.080,"I tried to be a good queen and make everyone happy, but it's a lot harder than you'd think."
00:09:59.120,00:10:03.200,Especially with elves.
00:10:03.200,00:10:08.200,Ahem. We are happy when we are busy.
00:10:08.200,00:10:10.080,Elves like being busy.
00:10:10.080,00:10:11.960,ELVES: And we're elves.
00:10:13.320,00:10:17.960,"Ha, ha. In that case, I command you to go back to work at once."
00:10:17.960,00:10:20.880,ELVES: Hooray.
00:10:17.960,00:10:24.080,And your first job will be to clean up all this ice cream.
00:10:24.080,00:10:26.800,"Thank you, Your Majesty."
00:10:26.800,00:10:29.120,Three cheers for King Thistle.
00:10:29.120,00:10:30.920,And Queen Holly.

00:10:38.680,00:10:46.440,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:10:51.840,00:10:54.040,That's enough playing for one day.
00:10:54.040,00:10:56.000,It's time for Ben to go home.
00:10:56.000,00:10:59.080,"Oh, can we play a little bit longer?"
00:10:59.080,00:11:01.480,"No, Holly, it's your bedtime."
00:11:01.480,00:11:03.760,"Is it your bedtime too, Nanny Plum?"
00:11:03.760,00:11:07.160,"Goodness me, no."
00:11:07.160,00:11:09.200,You have to work all night?
00:11:09.200,00:11:11.080,I'm a tooth fairy.
00:11:11.080,00:11:13.240,You're a tooth fairy?
00:11:13.240,00:11:19.560,"Yes. When a child loses a baby tooth, they put it under the pillow before going to sleep."
00:11:23.160,00:11:24.760,BOTH: Wow.
00:11:28.120,00:11:29.880,The Tooth Fairy!
00:11:29.880,00:11:31.920,Ooh. Exciting.
00:11:31.920,00:11:34.400,I have to collect a little girl's tooth tonight.
00:11:34.400,00:11:36.600,"Can we come with you, Nanny?"
00:11:36.600,00:11:40.240,Hm.
00:11:40.240,00:11:43.040,We mustn't wake the little girl up.
00:11:43.040,00:11:46.040,"We can be quiet, can't we, Ben?"
00:11:46.040,00:11:48.400,Elves are very good at being quiet.
00:11:48.400,00:11:51.040,And I'm an elf.
00:11:51.040,00:11:53.160,Shush. Dear me.
00:11:53.160,00:11:56.520,"This is why there are no tooth elves, only tooth fairies."
00:11:56.520,00:11:59.880,It's very late to be making so much noise.
00:11:59.880,00:12:01.680,"Shouldn't you be getting home, Ben?"
00:12:01.680,00:12:04.760,We want to see Nanny be the tooth fairy.
00:12:04.760,00:12:06.880,"But you've got school tomorrow, Holly."
00:12:09.400,00:12:11.680,But it's very dark outside.
00:12:11.680,00:12:14.840,Princess Holly could do with some night-flying practice.
00:12:14.840,00:12:18.960,But being a tooth fairy can be very dangerous work.
00:12:18.960,00:12:20.520,We'll be very careful.
00:12:20.520,00:12:23.600,But-- Please can we go?
00:12:23.600,00:12:26.480,Okay. As long as you stay close to Nanny.
00:12:26.480,00:12:28.480,BOTH: Hooray.
00:12:35.120,00:12:38.760,ALL: The Tooth Fairy. Heh.
00:12:38.760,00:12:43.400,"Nanny, why did Mommy say being a tooth fairy was dangerous?"
00:12:43.400,00:12:47.680,There are lots of things you need to be careful of when you're flying at night.
00:12:47.680,00:12:50.120,Like what? Aah.
00:12:50.120,00:12:52.080,"NANNY: Cobwebs, for instance."
00:12:52.080,00:12:55.120,"Good evening, Madame Spider."
00:12:55.120,00:13:01.440,"Sorry for damaging your web, but the young elf isn't very experienced at night flying."
00:13:01.440,00:13:04.640,Phew.
00:13:04.640,00:13:07.200,Bye.
00:13:07.200,00:13:09.520,"Thanks, Nanny Plum."
00:13:09.520,00:13:14.320,"Nanny, what else do we have to look out for? Aah."
00:13:14.320,00:13:17.760,Windows.
00:13:17.760,00:13:22.120,"Well done, Holly, you've found the little girl's house."
00:13:22.120,00:13:24.920,And that's the little girl.
00:13:24.920,00:13:27.400,She doesn't look very little.
00:13:27.400,00:13:29.880,Wow.
00:13:29.880,00:13:37.280,"Shush. She's also got big ears to hear us with, so be very quiet."
00:13:37.280,00:13:39.080,Follow me.
00:13:43.680,00:13:45.320,She's very pretty.
00:13:45.320,00:13:47.280,"Not too close, Princess Holly."
00:13:47.280,00:13:50.880,Ooh. Her breath is pulling me in.
00:13:50.880,00:13:52.680,Beat your wings.
00:13:55.920,00:14:00.320,"As I said, we must be very careful."
00:14:00.320,00:14:02.200,This is the tricky bit.
00:14:02.200,00:14:08.000,I have to get the tooth from under the pillow without waking the little girl.
00:14:08.000,00:14:10.600,How?
00:14:10.600,00:14:17.800,"Gently pillow Up, up, up BOTH: Wow."
00:14:19.000,00:14:22.040,Ugh. It's stuck.
00:14:22.040,00:14:25.200,"One, two, three. Pull."
00:14:25.200,00:14:27.160,"Oh. Thanks, Ben."
00:14:27.160,00:14:31.720,That's what I call a big baby tooth.
00:14:31.720,00:14:34.360,"What about the coin, Nanny?"
00:14:34.360,00:14:37.800,"Here it is. Oh, no."
00:14:37.800,00:14:40.120,What's wrong?
00:14:43.160,00:14:45.400,I love getting letters.
00:14:45.400,00:14:48.080,But the children always want a reply.
00:14:48.080,00:14:49.960,Now we'll have to come back again.
00:14:49.960,00:14:52.280,Can I read it?
00:14:52.280,00:14:54.320,Dear Tooth Fairy.
00:14:54.320,00:14:57.480,What is it like to live in Fairyland?
00:14:57.480,00:15:00.320,Fairyland?
00:14:57.480,00:15:03.760,That makes it sound like some silly make-believe place.
00:15:03.760,00:15:05.760,"Um. No, Ben."
00:15:05.760,00:15:09.040,Maybe there wasn't enough room on the paper.
00:15:09.040,00:15:12.240,"But she does say, Love from Lucy."
00:15:12.240,00:15:13.960,That's a lovely name.
00:15:21.360,00:15:24.880,"Nanny, what happens to the tooth now?"
00:15:24.880,00:15:28.200,We give it to the elves.
00:15:29.640,00:15:31.560,BEN: This way.
00:15:32.800,00:15:35.360,Hopefully there'll be no one there.
00:15:35.360,00:15:37.680,Then we can just leave our tooth and go.
00:15:37.680,00:15:39.760,"Good evening, can I help you?"
00:15:39.760,00:15:42.520,"Oh, hello."
00:15:42.520,00:15:45.920,Have you filled in your tooth report?
00:15:45.920,00:15:49.200,There appear to be some details missing.
00:15:49.200,00:15:51.680,Where was the tooth found?
00:15:51.680,00:15:53.920,"Ugh, under the pillow."
00:15:53.920,00:15:56.880,Under the pillow.
00:15:56.880,00:16:00.440,"Dear me, you haven't even put the little girl's name."
00:16:00.440,00:16:03.280,We know that.
00:16:03.280,00:16:04.840,Lucy.
00:16:04.840,00:16:07.960,And she's written us a letter.
00:16:07.960,00:16:09.840,Ah. A letter.
00:16:09.840,00:16:12.880,There'll have to be a reply before morning.
00:16:12.880,00:16:15.600,Oh.
00:16:15.600,00:16:18.480,Dear Lucy. Um.
00:16:18.480,00:16:21.760,It's very nice in the Little Kingdom.
00:16:21.760,00:16:25.400,There are lots of fairies.
00:16:25.400,00:16:30.240,"Okay, Ben. And there are lots of elves too."
00:16:30.240,00:16:33.720,"Love, Princess Holly."
00:16:33.720,00:16:38.320,And Ben Elf.
00:16:40.680,00:16:43.480,NANNY: Now we've got to take it back.
00:16:45.520,00:16:48.640,"We'll have to be quick, it's almost morning."
00:16:55.640,00:16:58.880,NANNY: Someone's coming.
00:16:58.880,00:17:00.280,Hide under the bed.
00:17:02.120,00:17:04.960,That must be Lucy's mommy.
00:17:10.600,00:17:13.760,"Oh, no."
00:17:13.760,00:17:16.000,How will we get out?
00:17:16.000,00:17:18.200,This is elf work.
00:17:18.200,00:17:22.640,"Elves are good at opening windows, and I'm an elf."
00:17:26.480,00:17:28.440,Sorry.
00:17:30.440,00:17:34.960,"Hm, I think we're going to need more than one elf."
00:17:34.960,00:17:37.800,I'll ring for more elves.
00:17:39.080,00:17:43.080,"Oh, where can I get a signal on my phone?"
00:17:43.080,00:17:46.360,"Don't stand too close, Ben."
00:17:46.360,00:17:49.000,Agh. Help.
00:17:49.000,00:17:53.600,What did Nanny say?
00:17:53.600,00:17:56.440,But I'm an elf.
00:17:56.440,00:17:59.360,"Okay, um."
00:18:01.840,00:18:03.480,Hello.
00:18:03.480,00:18:05.760,You're meant to be asleep.
00:18:05.760,00:18:07.880,You're not supposed to see us.
00:18:07.880,00:18:10.960,Who are you?
00:18:10.960,00:18:14.840,I'm a fairy princess.
00:18:10.960,00:18:17.480,"A real fairy princess, with wings and a wand and everything?"
00:18:17.480,00:18:20.000,Heh. Yes.
00:18:20.000,00:18:21.920,And this is Ben.
00:18:21.920,00:18:24.400,"Hi, Holly. Hi, Ben."
00:18:24.400,00:18:26.840,Oh.
00:18:26.840,00:18:30.360,Thank you.
00:18:31.520,00:18:33.560,It's a terrible signal.
00:18:33.560,00:18:36.280,Nanny Plum.
00:18:36.280,00:18:38.560,Don't you know what time it is?
00:18:38.560,00:18:40.720,I didn't call to ask you the time.
00:18:40.720,00:18:43.680,We're in a big house and the window's closed.
00:18:43.680,00:18:45.560,I need some elves to rescue us.
00:18:45.560,00:18:46.840,I see.
00:18:46.840,00:18:50.040,How many elves do you need?
00:18:55.760,00:18:57.760,"There, it's open."
00:18:57.760,00:18:59.000,"Thanks, Lucy."
00:18:59.000,00:19:01.280,"It was nice meeting you, Lucy."
00:19:01.280,00:19:03.920,But we weren't supposed to wake you.
00:19:03.920,00:19:07.040,It's okay.
00:19:07.040,00:19:09.080,Heh. Bye-bye.
00:19:09.080,00:19:11.800,"Hm, I see you woke the little girl up."
00:19:11.800,00:19:13.680,"We didn't mean to, Nanny."
00:19:13.680,00:19:16.440,"Oh, it's okay."
00:19:19.840,00:19:23.480,ALL: Elves to the rescue.
00:19:27.000,00:19:30.960,Now where's this window that needs opening?
00:19:32.640,00:19:35.280,But that's an open window.
00:19:35.280,00:19:38.320,"Yes, we've done it ourselves, we don't need you anymore."
00:19:38.320,00:19:40.400,Sorry.
00:19:40.400,00:19:45.000,You've just dragged every elf in the kingdom from their beds.
00:19:45.000,00:19:48.000,Shush.
00:19:48.000,00:19:49.760,Of course I can.
00:19:49.760,00:19:52.600,Elves are very good at being quiet.
00:19:52.600,00:19:54.640,ALL: And we're elves.
00:19:54.640,00:20:00.120,No-- This is why elves can't be tooth fairies.
00:20:00.120,00:20:02.760,You're too noisy.
00:20:02.760,00:20:05.360,"Are you all right, Lucy?"
00:20:08.040,00:20:11.560,"It's okay, she's asleep."
00:20:11.560,00:20:15.120,You can come out now.
00:20:15.120,00:20:17.960,"ALL: Bye, Lucy. See you again."
00:20:17.960,00:20:19.760,"Bye, Ben and Holly."
00:20:21.320,00:20:26.080,"Um, can we have a lift?"
00:20:26.080,00:20:27.400,Hop aboard.
00:20:30.320,00:20:33.680,Heh. That was fun.

00:00:52.080,00:00:55.920,"I'd like to play, Ben, but I can't."
00:00:55.920,00:00:58.720,We're going to visit King and Queen Marigold.
00:00:58.720,00:01:00.520,They're a bit snooty.
00:01:00.520,00:01:02.400,I'm glad I'm not going.
00:01:02.400,00:01:04.920,I wish I wasn't going.
00:01:04.920,00:01:08.840,Maybe your mom will let you stay and play with me.
00:01:08.840,00:01:12.000,"Mommy, can I play with Ben today?"
00:01:12.000,00:01:13.480,What a good idea.
00:01:13.480,00:01:14.800,BOTH: Hooray!
00:01:14.800,00:01:16.320,Ben can come too.

00:01:18.160,00:01:20.040,"That's all right, isn't it, Mr. Elf?"
00:01:20.040,00:01:22.880,"Oh, yes, go off and enjoy yourself, Ben."
00:01:22.880,00:01:24.920,See you later.
00:01:24.920,00:01:27.000,Bye.
00:01:29.200,00:01:31.720,"Oh, you're coming too, are you?"
00:01:31.720,00:01:33.440,NANNY: Okay.
00:01:33.440,00:01:42.680,"Magic car, drive on This is fun. A magic car."
00:01:42.680,00:01:46.480,Yes. It uses fairy dust to make it go.
00:01:46.480,00:01:48.880,Cool.
00:01:50.440,00:01:53.560,I want you all on your best behavior today.

00:01:56.000,00:02:00.680,King and Queen Marigold's home will be full of very precious things.
00:02:00.680,00:02:02.680,Horrible but precious.
00:02:02.680,00:02:05.440,So you mustn't touch anything.
00:02:05.440,00:02:10.080,Visiting King and Queen Marigold sounds like hard work.
00:02:10.080,00:02:12.520,It'll be exhausting.
00:02:19.360,00:02:21.720,King and Queen Marigold's castle.
00:02:24.600,00:02:26.080,KING: Such bad taste.
00:02:26.080,00:02:28.080,HOLLY: It's beautiful.
00:02:28.080,00:02:30.000,BEN: Cool castle.
00:02:31.200,00:02:33.520,Hello and welcome.
00:02:33.520,00:02:36.400,"Holly, you remember King and Queen Marigold."
00:02:38.960,00:02:42.440,"Hello. And this is my best friend, Ben."
00:02:42.440,00:02:44.080,You've met him before.
00:02:48.080,00:02:50.640,"I'm not a goblin, I'm an elf."
00:02:50.640,00:02:53.160,"Oh, an elf."
00:02:53.160,00:02:54.880,How exotic.
00:02:54.880,00:02:57.680,Did you have a pleasant journey?
00:02:57.680,00:03:02.560,It must be so nice to leave your Little Kingdom behind for a day.
00:03:02.560,00:03:06.800,"Tell us, honestly, what you think of our castle?"
00:03:06.800,00:03:11.000,It looks like a complete-- It's very nice.
00:03:11.000,00:03:14.480,"I wish we had a castle like this, Mommy."
00:03:14.480,00:03:18.680,"Before we had it rebuilt in plastic, it was made of stone."
00:03:18.680,00:03:20.600,Imagine. How primitive.
00:03:20.600,00:03:23.360,Our castle is made of stone.
00:03:23.360,00:03:27.440,"Ah, but you live in an old-fashioned castle."
00:03:27.440,00:03:31.720,"Hm, it must be very uncomfortable."
00:03:31.720,00:03:34.000,Not really.
00:03:34.000,00:03:36.560,Oh. You've brought your ladybird.
00:03:38.160,00:03:39.880,"Down, Gaston, down."
00:03:41.600,00:03:43.000,That means he likes you.
00:03:43.000,00:03:45.080,"Charmed, I'm sure."
00:03:45.080,00:03:46.720,Let's go inside.
00:03:46.720,00:03:49.160,We'll give you the tour.
00:03:49.160,00:03:51.200,Can Gaston come too?
00:03:51.200,00:03:53.400,As long as he wipes his feet.
00:03:54.600,00:03:57.160,"Yes, if you could all wipe your feet."
00:03:57.160,00:04:00.600,And please don't touch anything.
00:04:00.600,00:04:04.520,"And, if you could, try not to breathe too heavily."
00:04:04.520,00:04:09.080,We've got lots of precious things.
00:04:14.280,00:04:19.560,"As you can see, we've turned the idea of the hallway on its head."
00:04:19.560,00:04:20.840,Ridiculous.
00:04:20.840,00:04:24.280,Wow. It's all upside down.
00:04:24.280,00:04:25.680,Amazing.
00:04:25.680,00:04:28.440,"Oh, where's Gaston gone?"
00:04:29.760,00:04:31.200,KING: There's Gaston.
00:04:31.200,00:04:32.920,He's walking on the ceiling.
00:04:32.920,00:04:34.440,"No, Daddy."
00:04:34.440,00:04:38.320,Gaston's walking on the upside-down floor.
00:04:38.320,00:04:40.160,"Clever, Gaston."
00:04:40.160,00:04:43.800,"Hm, yes, and I see he didn't wipe his feet."
00:04:45.000,00:04:46.960,"Nanny, clean it up."
00:04:46.960,00:04:48.720,I'm not your servant.
00:04:48.720,00:04:51.920,"That's right, Nanny, you're my servant."
00:04:51.920,00:04:53.280,"Thank you, Your Majesty."
00:04:53.280,00:04:54.960,"So clean it up, Nanny."
00:04:54.960,00:04:56.560,"Ugh. Yes, Your Majesty."
00:04:56.560,00:05:04.080,Muddy footprints Away you go Good. Now where were we?
00:05:04.080,00:05:08.400,There are 100 rooms in our castle.
00:05:08.400,00:05:10.720,What do you do with all those rooms?
00:05:10.720,00:05:15.320,"We fill them, my boy, with things."
00:05:15.320,00:05:19.320,This is our collection of pebbles.
00:05:19.320,00:05:21.480,Pebbles?
00:05:21.480,00:05:28.040,There is nothing quite as wonderful as a well-polished pebble.
00:05:28.040,00:05:29.320,"Oh, Indeed."
00:05:29.320,00:05:30.880,What do they do?
00:05:30.880,00:05:33.440,They're beautiful.
00:05:33.440,00:05:34.800,Please don't touch them.
00:05:34.800,00:05:37.880,We don't want them to get them sticky.
00:05:37.880,00:05:41.120,Children always have sticky hands.
00:05:41.120,00:05:43.000,"No, we don't."
00:05:43.000,00:05:45.280,"Yes, you do."
00:05:45.280,00:05:48.440,"Do you think the pebbles look beautiful, King Thistle?"
00:05:48.440,00:05:52.760,What?
00:05:52.760,00:05:55.440,This way.
00:05:58.320,00:06:00.560,Greenfly.
00:06:00.560,00:06:01.960,Mm.
00:06:01.960,00:06:03.680,"Good boy, Gaston."
00:06:03.680,00:06:05.320,You won't be needing dinner now.
00:06:05.320,00:06:08.560,"Oh, I see you've found our pet greenfly."
00:06:08.560,00:06:11.360,"Lucinda, Gucci and Timmy."
00:06:11.360,00:06:14.560,"Oh, where is Timmy?"
00:06:15.840,00:06:18.520,Timmy!
00:06:18.520,00:06:20.680,"Hm, perhaps he's gone for a walk."
00:06:20.680,00:06:22.000,Timmy!
00:06:22.000,00:06:25.000,"Gaston, spit Timmy out."
00:06:27.680,00:06:29.520,"Ah, Timmy."
00:06:31.240,00:06:32.760,"Playing hide-and-seek, were we?"
00:06:33.840,00:06:37.920,"Now, you may find the next room a little chilly."
00:06:43.440,00:06:46.240,Brr.
00:06:46.240,00:06:52.880,Yes. This room must be kept well below freezing temperature at all times.
00:06:56.600,00:06:59.920,"They look very beautiful, Queen Marigold."
00:06:59.920,00:07:03.280,"Yes. They're, uh, cool."
00:07:03.280,00:07:05.520,"Please, don't touch."
00:07:05.520,00:07:07.600,Are they made with magic?
00:07:07.600,00:07:11.160,"Oh, no."
00:07:11.160,00:07:16.240,They are made from ice that froze over a thousand years ago.
00:07:16.240,00:07:17.520,BEN &amp; HOLLY: Ooh!
00:07:17.520,00:07:23.600,KING MARIGOLD: And hand-carved by Norwegian mining pixies.
00:07:23.600,00:07:28.840,These sculptures are one-of-a-kind and simply irreplaceable.
00:07:28.840,00:07:30.200,Ooh.
00:07:30.200,00:07:33.720,A swan. That's nice.
00:07:33.720,00:07:34.960,"Oh, dear."
00:07:34.960,00:07:37.320,"Nanny, what have you done?"
00:07:37.320,00:07:39.800,You've broken the swan's head off.
00:07:39.800,00:07:42.800,It's all right.
00:07:42.800,00:07:51.640,"Abracadabra, make me a bird Ice thingy Nanny, that's not a swan."
00:07:53.400,00:07:55.360,"BEN: Or a duck, maybe."
00:07:55.360,00:07:58.760,It looks lovely.
00:07:58.760,00:08:01.800,This way. Do keep up.
00:08:03.240,00:08:08.600,This is our finest and most treasured collection of all.
00:08:08.600,00:08:10.680,Antique toys.
00:08:10.680,00:08:11.960,Amazing.
00:08:11.960,00:08:14.560,You must play in here all the time.
00:08:17.360,00:08:21.200,This monkey is over a hundred years old.
00:08:34.080,00:08:40.920,"Apparently, they were made at the Elf Factory, by someone called the Wise Old Elf."
00:08:40.920,00:08:43.200,We know the Wise Old Elf.
00:08:43.200,00:08:46.560,Aah.
00:08:46.560,00:08:48.000,What's he like?
00:08:48.000,00:08:49.520,He's wise.
00:08:49.520,00:08:53.960,He's-- He's a grumpy old elf that's a bit clever.
00:08:55.720,00:08:58.360,KING MARIGOLD: This is my favorite toy.
00:08:58.360,00:09:01.480,HOLLY: A clockwork fairground ride.
00:09:01.480,00:09:04.520,"But sadly, it's broken."
00:09:17.680,00:09:19.880,"And I can help you, Ben."
00:09:19.880,00:09:21.880,Aah! Don't touch!
00:09:21.880,00:09:26.080,These toys must not be touched by children.
00:09:26.080,00:09:28.800,We'll have to touch it to mend it.
00:09:28.800,00:09:32.480,Uh... Okay.
00:09:42.080,00:09:44.440,There. It's mended.
00:09:47.000,00:09:48.440,Whoopee!
00:09:52.240,00:09:54.680,"Ho-ho-ho. Vroom, vroom."
00:09:54.680,00:09:55.880,BOTH: Whee!
00:09:57.280,00:09:59.040,This is fun.
00:10:03.560,00:10:05.040,"Oh, it's stopped."
00:10:05.040,00:10:06.600,I want it to go again.
00:10:06.600,00:10:09.200,"Oh, yes."
00:10:09.200,00:10:11.200,"More, more, more!"
00:10:11.200,00:10:12.440,Okay.
00:10:16.440,00:10:18.920,Ha-ha-ha.
00:10:18.920,00:10:23.560,King and Queen Marigold's castle isn't boring at all.
00:10:23.560,00:10:26.680,"Yes, actually."
00:10:26.680,00:10:28.040,"ALL: Choo, choo!"
00:10:35.240,00:10:37.480,Ha-ha-ha.
00:10:38.800,00:10:47.040,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:10:52.600,00:10:53.800,"Come on, everyone."
00:10:53.800,00:10:55.360,We've got to get ready for the party.
00:10:55.360,00:10:56.680,Party?
00:10:56.680,00:10:58.880,Daisy and Poppy's birthday party.
00:10:58.880,00:11:00.720,"ALL: Aah! Oh, no."
00:11:00.720,00:11:03.440,BOTH: Party. Party.
00:11:03.440,00:11:05.800,Two magical toddlers are bad enough...
00:11:05.800,00:11:11.040,"But when all their little friends turn up, it's terrible."
00:11:12.360,00:11:14.960,I've got it.
00:11:12.360,00:11:17.200,"We'll have the party, but we won't invite any guests."
00:11:18.680,00:11:22.920,I've sent out all the party invites and everybody's coming.
00:11:22.920,00:11:24.960,Oh. Who's coming?
00:11:24.960,00:11:26.960,There's little Tarquin...
00:11:26.960,00:11:30.000,Tarquin like party.
00:11:30.000,00:11:33.440,"Oh, no."
00:11:33.440,00:11:35.400,And there's Raspberry...
00:11:35.400,00:11:37.360,Not my little sister?
00:11:40.840,00:11:42.120,And Nettle Elf.
00:11:44.760,00:11:50.920,"She's got a stinging nettle in her hat, and it stings when you touch it."
00:11:50.920,00:11:54.200,Nettle Elf is the naughtiest of the lot.
00:11:54.200,00:11:55.600,What do you expect?
00:11:55.600,00:11:57.920,She's got a pirate for an uncle.
00:11:57.920,00:12:01.920,"Yes, Redbeard the Elf Pirate."
00:12:03.160,00:12:07.160,This party is going to be a disaster.
00:12:07.160,00:12:09.960,Don't worry.
00:12:09.960,00:12:16.520,"We'll have magic games, followed by my magic show, and ending with magic jelly."
00:12:16.520,00:12:18.200,BOTH: Magicky. Magicky.
00:12:19.920,00:12:22.880,I was wrong. The party's not going to be a disaster.
00:12:22.880,00:12:25.400,It's going to be a catastrophe.
00:12:25.400,00:12:27.400,"Thank you, Your Majesty."
00:12:27.400,00:12:31.640,"I know, King Thistle."
00:12:31.640,00:12:32.840,A what?
00:12:32.840,00:12:35.960,An elf party has no magic at all.
00:12:35.960,00:12:37.960,But what about my magic show?
00:12:37.960,00:12:40.000,The toddlers love a magic show.
00:12:40.000,00:12:44.080,"We have the Great Wizardo, an elf conjuror."
00:12:44.080,00:12:47.880,"He doesn't do real magic, it's just tricks."
00:12:47.880,00:12:51.400,"I like it, Ben."
00:12:51.400,00:12:52.760,"Yeah, and boring."
00:12:52.760,00:12:59.240,"Exactly. Nanny Plum, call this Great Wizardo and tell him we've got children we want to bore."
00:12:59.240,00:13:00.960,"I mean, entertain."
00:13:00.960,00:13:03.920,"Ugh. Very well, Your Majesty."
00:13:05.800,00:13:08.360,Welcome to the party.
00:13:08.360,00:13:10.960,Tarquin like party.
00:13:10.960,00:13:13.160,"Bye-bye, Tarquin. Be good."
00:13:13.160,00:13:14.560,"Yes, Mama."
00:13:14.560,00:13:16.800,Oh.
00:13:16.800,00:13:18.160,"Hello, Nettle."
00:13:18.160,00:13:19.880,Ow! That stings.
00:13:19.880,00:13:23.640,Nanny Plum.
00:13:24.880,00:13:27.000,"Enjoy the party, Nettle."
00:13:27.000,00:13:29.720,I'll be back to pick you up later.
00:13:32.320,00:13:34.200,"Settle down, children."
00:13:34.200,00:13:35.640,Please.
00:13:35.640,00:13:39.760,The Great Wizardo.
00:13:39.760,00:13:41.640,That's just the Wise Old Elf.
00:13:41.640,00:13:48.520,"I'm not just the Wise Old Elf, I'm also a children's entertainer."
00:13:48.520,00:13:50.360,Oh. Carry on then.
00:13:50.360,00:13:52.920,These children are a bit of a handful.
00:13:52.920,00:13:54.520,Especially when they do magic.
00:13:54.520,00:13:58.200,There won't be any magic at this party.
00:13:58.200,00:14:04.600,I'll put the toddlers' wands into the library where they can't cause any trouble.
00:14:05.800,00:14:08.800,Let's get this party started.
00:14:08.800,00:14:10.240,ALL: Hooray!
00:14:10.240,00:14:12.600,Musical statues.
00:14:12.600,00:14:18.240,"When the music stops, you have to stand as still as a statue."
00:14:18.240,00:14:20.360,Aha.
00:14:23.320,00:14:25.000,"And you, Nettle."
00:14:25.000,00:14:29.920,That's because they haven't been turned to stone yet.
00:14:29.920,00:14:32.120,Aah! Strawberry.
00:14:32.120,00:14:34.920,You've magicked them into real statues.
00:14:34.920,00:14:36.320,Of course.
00:14:36.320,00:14:39.720,That's how we fairies play musical statues.
00:14:39.720,00:14:42.800,This is not a fairy party.
00:14:42.800,00:14:44.240,Turn them back to normal.
00:14:44.240,00:14:46.600,Okay.
00:14:46.600,00:14:51.560,The big children's wands are going into the library with the others.
00:14:51.560,00:14:56.720,Now it's time to play Stick the Tail on the Donkey.
00:14:56.720,00:14:59.080,Here's the donkey.
00:14:59.080,00:15:01.720,Looks like a cabbage.
00:15:01.720,00:15:03.200,It's a donkey.
00:15:03.200,00:15:10.400,"Now, I will blindfold Nettle Elf and she'll try to stick this tail on the donkey."
00:15:14.320,00:15:16.320,It's a stupid game anyway.
00:15:16.320,00:15:20.040,You need a big dragon to stick the tail on.
00:15:20.040,00:15:21.520,Aah!
00:15:25.400,00:15:29.200,Ah. Looks like the twins' party has started.
00:15:31.120,00:15:33.520,Get rid of the dragon.
00:15:35.560,00:15:37.960,Just trying to liven the party up a bit.
00:15:37.960,00:15:41.920,I'm putting the grownups' wands in the library too.
00:15:41.920,00:15:45.440,"Now, for my conjuring show."
00:15:45.440,00:15:46.800,ALL: Hooray!
00:15:46.800,00:15:49.480,"Queen Thistle, please take a card."
00:15:50.920,00:15:52.960,Don't show me.
00:15:52.960,00:15:54.480,What is your card?
00:15:54.480,00:15:56.600,"Um, the two of hearts."
00:15:56.600,00:15:58.880,Your card is...
00:15:58.880,00:16:01.000,The two of hearts.
00:16:01.000,00:16:04.920,That's the worst trick I've ever seen.
00:16:06.800,00:16:08.240,How's it done?
00:16:08.240,00:16:13.920,"For my next trick, I will turn myself into a mouse."
00:16:13.920,00:16:15.520,ALL: Ooh.
00:16:15.520,00:16:20.720,You little ones need to wait behind this door for a moment.
00:16:23.280,00:16:31.360,"I put these ears on and this nose. Then I-- Um, was it a good idea putting the toddlers in the library?"
00:16:31.360,00:16:34.160,What?
00:16:31.360,00:16:36.040,It's same the room you put all the wands in.
00:16:36.040,00:16:37.520,Ah.
00:16:39.000,00:16:42.640,"Don't worry, the Great Wizardo will sort this out."
00:16:42.640,00:16:44.880,I'll show them my mouse trick.
00:16:44.880,00:16:46.680,That will surprise them.
00:16:46.680,00:16:49.880,"They'll be surprised how bad it is, so it might work."
00:16:49.880,00:17:00.240,"Look, children, I've turned myself into a-- ALL: Mousey, mousey Wow."
00:17:00.240,00:17:01.560,Uh...
00:17:01.560,00:17:05.840,The toddlers have magicked the Wise Old Elf into a real mouse.
00:17:07.160,00:17:11.440,Can someone please magic me back into an elf?
00:17:11.440,00:17:17.240,"No, we can't do any magic because somebody put all the wands in the library."
00:17:17.240,00:17:19.080,"Ah, yes."
00:17:20.560,00:17:22.440,"Ahoy, me hearties."
00:17:24.520,00:17:28.520,"Oh. Actually, the party's not quite over yet."
00:17:28.520,00:17:31.160,No?
00:17:28.520,00:17:33.080,The toddlers are in the library with the dangerous spellbooks.
00:17:33.080,00:17:35.200,They've got all the magic wands.
00:17:35.200,00:17:38.480,And they've magicked the Wise Old Elf into a mouse.
00:17:39.720,00:17:42.440,Sounds like a fun party.
00:17:42.440,00:17:44.000,It's gone quiet.
00:17:44.000,00:17:45.520,They're up to something.
00:17:45.520,00:17:47.480,Let's take a look.
00:17:47.480,00:17:49.280,Hello? Hello?
00:17:49.280,00:17:51.160,There's no one here.
00:17:51.160,00:17:53.200,Just our wands.
00:17:53.200,00:17:56.200,Ah. It's good to have you back again.
00:17:56.200,00:18:01.640,"Uh, Nanny, now you have your wand again, would you mind, um...?"
00:18:01.640,00:18:04.640,"Of course, oh, Great Wizardo."
00:18:04.640,00:18:11.120,Silly old elf Back to yourself So where be the poor little toddlers?
00:18:11.120,00:18:13.160,I was afraid of this.
00:18:13.160,00:18:17.200,Daisy and Poppy have found the secret passageway.
00:18:19.280,00:18:22.160,Where does the secret passageway go?
00:18:22.160,00:18:24.160,To the secret room.
00:18:24.160,00:18:26.760,I never knew we had a secret room.
00:18:26.760,00:18:29.280,That's because it's secret.
00:18:31.040,00:18:36.800,The room contains a magical force that must never be let out.
00:18:36.800,00:18:40.840,"So not a good room for toddlers to be in, then."
00:18:42.520,00:18:45.240,I hear the sound of excited little ones.
00:18:45.240,00:18:47.600,And something else.
00:18:47.600,00:18:50.360,We must not enter.
00:18:50.360,00:18:52.560,Honestly.
00:18:50.360,00:18:55.760,What a lot of fuss about a terrible magical force of unimaginable power.
00:18:55.760,00:18:57.320,I'll handle this.
00:18:57.320,00:19:00.400,"Good luck, me brave little pumpkin."
00:19:04.440,00:19:05.920,BEN: What can you see?
00:19:05.920,00:19:08.360,HOLLY: Terrible things.
00:19:08.360,00:19:11.920,Redbeard to the rescue.
00:19:14.560,00:19:17.120,Here be the toddlers.
00:19:17.120,00:19:18.400,NANNY: Help!
00:19:18.400,00:19:21.400,"Hang on, Nanny Plum!"
00:19:22.720,00:19:24.080,Here she be.
00:19:24.080,00:19:27.480,"You're safe now, my plum pudding."
00:19:28.680,00:19:31.280,I've seen many a terrible thing at sea.
00:19:31.280,00:19:36.840,"But nothing, nothing as bad as what I saw in that room."
00:19:36.840,00:19:40.240,That's why we tend to keep the door locked.
00:19:40.240,00:19:43.400,Good. The party's over.
00:19:43.400,00:19:45.480,"It all went rather well, I thought."
00:19:45.480,00:19:49.000,But what about the jelly?
00:19:49.000,00:19:51.680,ALL: Magic Jelly. Magic Jelly.
00:19:51.680,00:19:53.160,"All right, Nanny."
00:19:53.160,00:19:56.120,But please don't make too much this time.
00:19:59.120,00:20:01.160,Look. Magic jelly.
00:20:01.160,00:20:02.440,That's good.
00:20:02.440,00:20:04.600,The party must be almost over.
00:20:05.840,00:20:07.680,"Ah, Raspberry."
00:20:07.680,00:20:09.000,Have you had a nice time?
00:20:09.000,00:20:10.640,"Yes, Mommy."
00:20:10.640,00:20:12.880,"Tarquin, say, Thank you for having me."
00:20:12.880,00:20:15.200,Thank you for having me.
00:20:15.200,00:20:16.880,It was a pleasure.
00:20:16.880,00:20:18.080,"Goodbye, Nettle."
00:20:18.080,00:20:20.480,Ow! She stung me again.
00:20:27.400,00:20:31.680,"Yes. Here he is, the Great Wizardo."
00:20:31.680,00:20:34.760,Um... I-- Wonderful.
00:20:33.040,00:20:37.040,See you all at Raspberry's party then.
00:20:37.040,00:20:38.920,TODDLERS: Party. Party.
00:00:15.240,00:00:16.400,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:36.600,00:00:44.080,NARRATOR: Today's adventures starts at the Little Castle.
00:00:48.120,00:00:51.200,"No time to read the newspaper, Your Majesty."
00:00:53.480,00:00:55.280,What king's work?
00:00:55.280,00:00:58.040,The elves want you to inspect their latest toy.
00:00:58.040,00:01:02.200,Oh. I don't like these elf toy inspections.
00:01:02.200,00:01:06.600,"The toys are always perfect, and all I say is, They're perfect."
00:01:06.600,00:01:09.360,There's the Elf Truck now.
00:01:12.120,00:01:14.520,"Hello, Your Majesty."
00:01:14.520,00:01:18.520,May I present the very latest elf toy.
00:01:20.560,00:01:21.880,It's perfect.
00:01:25.240,00:01:26.800,"Okay, if I must."
00:01:34.600,00:01:36.360,But it's called a space rocket.
00:01:36.360,00:01:38.600,"It didn't go anywhere near space, did it?"
00:01:38.600,00:01:40.800,"It's just a toy, Your Majesty."
00:01:40.800,00:01:42.120,Just a toy?
00:01:42.120,00:01:44.440,I could kick a football higher than that.
00:01:44.440,00:01:47.680,And rockets should be able to go higher than footballs.
00:01:47.680,00:01:50.480,"Well, I'm sure we can make it go higher."
00:01:50.480,00:01:51.960,How high?
00:01:51.960,00:01:56.640,I could make a rocket go to the moon if I wanted to.
00:01:56.640,00:01:58.720,"Yes, I could."
00:01:59.880,00:02:01.720,And elves can do anything.
00:02:01.720,00:02:02.880,Very well.
00:02:02.880,00:02:07.240,I command the elves to build a rocket to fly me to the moon.
00:02:07.240,00:02:08.440,And me.
00:02:08.440,00:02:11.680,To fly me and Princess Holly to the moon.
00:02:11.680,00:02:13.960,And me.
00:02:15.200,00:02:17.920,And Nanny Plum to look after the children.
00:02:17.920,00:02:23.720,"I bet you can't fly Holly, Ben, Gaston, me and Nanny Plum to the moon."
00:02:23.720,00:02:26.240,You're on.
00:02:26.240,00:02:27.800,Oh. Okay.
00:02:27.800,00:02:29.000,Marvelous.
00:02:29.000,00:02:30.280,"See you later, then."
00:02:30.280,00:02:34.240,"Come on, Ben, we'd better go and start making that rocket."
00:02:34.240,00:02:36.160,It's a matter of elf honor.
00:02:38.240,00:02:39.720,See you tonight.
00:02:45.400,00:02:48.800,Ah!
00:02:48.800,00:02:52.440,Did the King say the toy rocket was perfect?
00:02:52.440,00:02:53.640,Uh...
00:02:53.640,00:02:55.480,He thought it could go a bit higher.
00:02:55.480,00:02:56.920,"Oh, really?"
00:02:56.920,00:03:00.280,"Well, I suppose I could fit a stronger spring."
00:03:02.760,00:03:04.000,To the moon.
00:03:04.000,00:03:05.480,To the moon?
00:03:05.480,00:03:08.320,And I said we could have some people inside.
00:03:11.240,00:03:13.160,Impossible.
00:03:13.160,00:03:14.760,Elf honor is at stake.
00:03:14.760,00:03:16.160,Elf honor?
00:03:16.160,00:03:18.080,"In that case, we must do it."
00:03:18.080,00:03:22.160,"We'll build this rocket, and we'll fly it to the moon."
00:03:25.680,00:03:29.520,Stop toy production at the Elf Factory.
00:03:29.520,00:03:33.760,Start work on the elf rocket immediately.
00:03:33.760,00:03:35.000,ALL: Right-o.
00:03:36.640,00:03:46.880,"Now, I will work out how to get the elf rocket from here-- BEN: The Little Kingdom."
00:03:46.880,00:03:48.760,WISE OLD ELF: --to here.
00:03:48.760,00:03:50.040,BEN: The moon.
00:03:56.000,00:04:00.040,I'd like you to join us on a little trip this evening to the moon.
00:04:00.040,00:04:01.800,A trip to the moon?
00:04:01.800,00:04:03.240,That sounds nice.
00:04:03.240,00:04:04.640,I'll pack a picnic.
00:04:07.200,00:04:08.680,"Hello, Your Majesty."
00:04:08.680,00:04:10.720,The elf rocket is ready.
00:04:10.720,00:04:13.400,That was quick.
00:04:13.400,00:04:15.560,And we're elves.
00:04:19.760,00:04:23.800,May I present the elf rocket.
00:04:28.720,00:04:30.560,KING: Not bad.
00:04:30.560,00:04:33.240,Does it fly?
00:04:33.240,00:04:34.840,Of course it flies!
00:04:34.840,00:04:37.560,It's an elf rocket.
00:04:37.560,00:04:43.200,"The rocket will land here, in the Sea of Tranquility."
00:04:44.920,00:04:47.440,We can make sand castles.
00:04:47.440,00:04:49.600,We can have a picnic on the beach.
00:04:49.600,00:04:51.720,And you can go paddling in the sea.
00:04:51.720,00:04:54.520,There is no water on the moon.
00:04:54.520,00:04:56.880,But what is the sea made from?
00:04:56.880,00:04:58.520,Just rock.
00:04:58.520,00:05:01.120,A sea of rock?
00:05:01.120,00:05:05.320,"Listen, everyone."
00:05:05.320,00:05:08.640,There'll be no swimming or picnics.
00:05:09.880,00:05:12.480,Here is the main cabin.
00:05:12.480,00:05:14.880,The cabin is a bit tiny.
00:05:14.880,00:05:17.200,I might stay down below in the kitchen.
00:05:17.200,00:05:18.400,The kitchen?
00:05:18.400,00:05:20.000,There isn't a kitchen.
00:05:20.000,00:05:21.360,No kitchen?
00:05:21.360,00:05:23.920,"What's all this big space for, then?"
00:05:23.920,00:05:27.800,"This space is for the fuel, Nanny Plum."
00:05:27.800,00:05:33.280,I have worked out exactly how much fuel we need to get you to the moon.
00:05:33.280,00:05:35.040,"Where's the toilet, then?"
00:05:35.040,00:05:36.360,There isn't one.
00:05:36.360,00:05:38.120,You'll just have to go before you leave.
00:05:38.120,00:05:39.560,No toilet?
00:05:39.560,00:05:43.480,"But if we're having a picnic at the seaside, we'll need-- Nanny Plum!"
00:05:43.480,00:05:46.320,It's not a picnic at the seaside.
00:05:46.320,00:05:48.560,It's a very serious mission.
00:05:48.560,00:05:50.880,We are going to the moon.
00:05:50.880,00:05:55.320,"Now, all astronauts, into their space suits!"
00:05:55.320,00:05:57.240,Get ready for take-off!
00:06:05.560,00:06:07.640,WISE OLD ELF: There's no air in space.
00:06:07.640,00:06:09.320,You'll have to wear a space suit.
00:06:09.320,00:06:11.880,But we can just use magic to breathe?
00:06:11.880,00:06:15.120,No. Magic is not allowed aboard the elf rocket.
00:06:15.120,00:06:17.520,You will have to leave your wands behind.
00:06:20.280,00:06:23.760,"Astronauts, aboard the rocket!"
00:06:26.640,00:06:33.160,"Queen Thistle, would you please come with me to the mission control room?"
00:06:33.160,00:06:35.720,QUEEN: Ooh!
00:06:35.720,00:06:37.600,Systems check.
00:06:38.720,00:06:40.560,COMPUTER: Engines are go.
00:06:40.560,00:06:41.800,Computers ready?
00:06:44.280,00:06:45.520,Fuel system ready?
00:06:45.520,00:06:48.240,COMPUTER: Fuel systems A-okay.
00:06:48.240,00:06:50.880,Start the countdown.
00:06:50.880,00:06:53.360,COMPUTER: Ten...
00:06:53.360,00:06:55.960,WISE OLD ELF: I want to wish you all the best of luck.
00:06:55.960,00:06:59.720,You are going where no elf has gone before.
00:06:59.720,00:07:01.840,Or fairy.
00:07:01.840,00:07:03.520,"Or fairy. Oh, sorry, Holly."
00:07:03.520,00:07:08.520,You are going where no elf or fairy has gone before.
00:07:08.520,00:07:10.240,Is everyone ready?
00:07:10.240,00:07:12.560,"All ready and A-okay, Wise Old Elf."
00:07:12.560,00:07:13.880,COMPUTER: ...zero.
00:07:13.880,00:07:15.520,Here we go!
00:07:15.520,00:07:17.440,Next stop: the moon.
00:07:17.440,00:07:18.760,Blast off!
00:07:21.760,00:07:23.080,"Hang on, everybody!"
00:07:23.080,00:07:24.520,All systems go.
00:07:26.560,00:07:28.040,QUEEN: Where did it go?
00:07:28.040,00:07:30.000,Where did it go?
00:07:31.720,00:07:33.600,Into space!
00:07:33.600,00:07:36.320,It actually worked.
00:07:36.320,00:07:38.160,I wasn't expecting that.
00:07:44.520,00:07:46.800,MR. ELF: We are now out of Earth's atmosphere.
00:07:46.800,00:07:48.280,We can take off our seatbelts.
00:07:48.280,00:07:51.440,"Whoa, I'm flying!"
00:07:51.440,00:07:54.320,That's because there's no gravity in space.
00:07:54.320,00:07:58.080,"I'm flapping my wings, but they don't do anything."
00:07:58.080,00:08:01.120,"Yes, your wings won't work in zero gravity."
00:08:02.720,00:08:04.400,Are you sure there isn't a toilet?
00:08:04.400,00:08:05.920,What's through this door?
00:08:10.000,00:08:11.440,Hang on!
00:08:13.440,00:08:15.000,What happened?
00:08:15.000,00:08:19.680,"When you open a door in space, it sucks all the air out of the rocket!"
00:08:19.680,00:08:23.640,Poor Nanny Plum.
00:08:25.840,00:08:28.960,My wings don't work!
00:08:28.960,00:08:31.480,"We can hear you through the radio, Nanny Plum."
00:08:31.480,00:08:35.080,You don't need to shout.
00:08:35.080,00:08:36.840,Stay calm?
00:08:36.840,00:08:41.120,I'm floating off into deep space!
00:08:43.200,00:08:44.800,What's going on up there?
00:08:44.800,00:08:50.640,Nanny Plum opened the door and is now lost in space.
00:08:50.640,00:08:53.440,"Oh, dear, that's a shame."
00:08:53.440,00:08:54.720,"Well, never mind."
00:08:54.720,00:08:55.920,On with the mission.
00:08:55.920,00:08:59.360,No.
00:08:59.360,00:09:01.840,"Oh, I suppose we must."
00:09:01.840,00:09:03.480,I'll rescue Nanny.
00:09:03.480,00:09:04.960,Me too.
00:09:06.320,00:09:08.480,All right.
00:09:06.320,00:09:10.680,You're all tied to this rope so you won't drift away.
00:09:10.680,00:09:12.680,BOTH: Ready.
00:09:14.360,00:09:16.240,"We're coming, Nanny Plum."
00:09:16.240,00:09:17.400,Hold on.
00:09:17.400,00:09:19.840,Hold on? Hold on to what?
00:09:21.040,00:09:24.000,"Oh, no."
00:09:24.000,00:09:27.200,"Mr. Elf, the rope isn't long enough."
00:09:27.200,00:09:30.600,"Oh, no! Lost in space."
00:09:30.600,00:09:33.320,And I never even went to the toilet.
00:09:33.320,00:09:35.360,"Here's your lasso, Ben."
00:09:35.360,00:09:37.000,"Thanks, Dad."
00:09:37.000,00:09:38.600,Keep still.
00:09:38.600,00:09:43.400,I'm going to throw this lasso around your waist.
00:09:43.400,00:09:44.600,Got you!
00:09:46.000,00:09:49.440,You rescued Nanny Plum.
00:09:51.760,00:09:53.160,"Oh, thank you, Ben."
00:09:55.880,00:09:58.040,"Let that be a lesson to you, Nanny Plum."
00:09:58.040,00:09:59.880,No more opening doors.
00:09:59.880,00:10:01.680,I was just having a look around.
00:10:03.600,00:10:05.280,This is a serious mission.
00:10:05.280,00:10:07.120,Elf honor is at stake.
00:10:07.120,00:10:08.800,"Well, I'm very sorry."
00:10:08.800,00:10:12.000,"I won't touch anything again, fairy's honor."
00:10:15.480,00:10:18.520,Our next stop is the moon.
00:10:23.560,00:10:29.680,"For the last time, Nanny Plum, there will be no picnic on the moon."
00:10:29.680,00:10:37.600,NARRATOR: This adventure continues in our next episode: Picnic on the Moon.
00:10:39.200,00:10:44.920,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts in outer space.
00:10:54.560,00:10:56.960,Elf rocket to mission control.
00:10:56.960,00:11:01.640,"In a few minutes, we will land on the moon."
00:11:01.640,00:11:03.720,"Very good, Mr. Elf."
00:11:09.320,00:11:10.880,Lovely.
00:11:10.880,00:11:13.520,"Once we're at the seaside, we can eat our picnic."
00:11:18.880,00:11:20.320,Why not?
00:11:20.320,00:11:25.200,Because this is a serious elf mission to the moon.
00:11:32.840,00:11:34.720,"Ready, everyone?"
00:11:34.720,00:11:38.840,We are about to go where no elf has gone before.
00:11:38.840,00:11:40.400,Or fairy.
00:11:41.920,00:11:46.520,We are going where no elf or fairy has gone before.
00:11:50.520,00:11:52.000,Woo-hoo!
00:11:52.000,00:11:53.360,Woo-hoo!
00:11:53.360,00:11:55.280,Look how high I can jump.
00:11:55.280,00:11:57.080,BEN: This is brilliant!
00:11:59.840,00:12:02.560,"All right, that's enough funny business."
00:12:04.600,00:12:07.840,"One, land on moon."
00:12:07.840,00:12:10.080,"Two, plant the flag."
00:12:10.080,00:12:13.120,I am now king of the moon.
00:12:19.240,00:12:21.160,Plant the flag. Done.
00:12:21.160,00:12:23.040,"Three, go back home."
00:12:24.320,00:12:27.080,And you missed out the seaside.
00:12:27.080,00:12:29.960,"Yes, where's this Sea of Tranquility?"
00:12:29.960,00:12:31.560,I fancy a paddle.
00:12:31.560,00:12:35.600,"Ah, the Sea of Tranquility doesn't have water in it."
00:12:35.600,00:12:37.160,It's full of sand.
00:12:37.160,00:12:40.480,But where do the aliens go when they want a swim?
00:12:40.480,00:12:42.080,Aliens?
00:12:42.080,00:12:44.960,Nanny Plum said there might be aliens on the moon.
00:12:44.960,00:12:48.120,"Ha, ha. Well, that's just a fairy story."
00:12:49.720,00:12:51.560,Aah! An alien.
00:12:51.560,00:12:52.960,Uh... Hello.
00:12:52.960,00:12:56.160,HOLLY: Aliens. Amazing.
00:12:59.080,00:13:00.320,He's saying hello.
00:13:00.320,00:13:02.480,"Can you speak Alien, Nanny?"
00:13:02.480,00:13:03.800,No.
00:13:03.800,00:13:07.440,This is mission control.
00:13:07.440,00:13:09.200,What's going on up there?
00:13:09.200,00:13:11.320,We just met an alien.
00:13:11.320,00:13:12.560,Amazing.
00:13:12.560,00:13:16.120,"This is an historic, momentous occasion."
00:13:16.120,00:13:19.160,This is the biggest thing to happen ever.
00:13:19.160,00:13:21.280,Do you think he'd like a cheese sandwich?
00:13:27.400,00:13:31.040,HOLLY: Maybe the aliens can show us where the seaside is.
00:13:31.040,00:13:34.760,"There is no sea on the moon, only sand."
00:13:34.760,00:13:37.320,We can still build sand castles.
00:13:37.320,00:13:38.600,Yes.
00:13:39.840,00:13:41.240,BOTH: Bingo!
00:13:41.240,00:13:43.880,No!
00:13:43.880,00:13:45.640,You'll upset the aliens.
00:13:48.160,00:13:51.000,Look. The aliens love building sand castles.
00:13:52.000,00:13:53.920,Bingo.
00:13:56.760,00:13:58.120,I'm a bit hungry.
00:13:58.120,00:13:59.640,Me too.
00:13:59.640,00:14:01.320,Time for the picnic.
00:14:01.320,00:14:02.600,No!
00:14:02.600,00:14:10.680,"Magic basket, please-- Magic! Nanny Plum, are you waving your magic wand around?"
00:14:12.640,00:14:15.600,It wasn't allowed on this silly elf mission.
00:14:15.600,00:14:17.440,"WISE OLD ELF: Ah, yes."
00:14:17.440,00:14:21.800,"Anyway, the magic picnic basket doesn't need a wand to work."
00:14:21.800,00:14:24.960,You just ask it for what you want.
00:14:24.960,00:14:34.040,"Magic basket, please Make us sandwiches With ham and cheese HOLLY: Yippee!"
00:14:34.040,00:14:36.480,And now for pudding!
00:14:36.480,00:14:37.840,Magic jelly!
00:14:37.840,00:14:40.520,BOTH: Magic jelly!
00:14:40.520,00:14:43.840,"Uh... Nanny Plum, we don't want another jelly flood."
00:14:43.840,00:14:45.680,"Oh, it'll be fine."
00:14:45.680,00:14:52.800,"Nanny Plum, I want you to think very carefully about what you are doing."
00:14:52.800,00:14:54.040,Whatever.
00:14:54.040,00:15:02.000,"Magic basket, please Jelly, jelly What's it doing?"
00:15:02.000,00:15:03.320,"Oh, no."
00:15:03.320,00:15:05.800,I forgot to say not a lot.
00:15:07.480,00:15:09.200,Jelly flood!
00:15:09.200,00:15:12.840,"Nanny, that's too much jelly!"
00:15:12.840,00:15:14.080,"NANNY: Oh, dear."
00:15:19.880,00:15:25.400,Nanny Plum has flooded the Sea of Tranquility with jelly.
00:15:28.040,00:15:29.880,Nanny Plum!
00:15:33.440,00:15:38.040,The Sea of Tranquility is now the sea of jelly.
00:15:38.040,00:15:39.560,Sorry.
00:15:40.720,00:15:43.720,The aliens will be very upset.
00:15:45.520,00:15:46.760,Jelly.
00:15:46.760,00:15:48.480,But the aliens like the jelly.
00:15:48.480,00:15:50.720,They're eating it all up.
00:15:51.920,00:15:53.520,They love it.
00:15:53.520,00:15:54.880,I better make some more.
00:15:54.880,00:16:02.320,"Magic basket-- No! Nanny Plum, I forbid you to make any more jelly on this mission."
00:16:02.320,00:16:05.400,NANNY: But look at the aliens' sad little faces.
00:16:05.400,00:16:07.320,They're still hungry.
00:16:07.320,00:16:10.360,No more magic jelly.
00:16:10.360,00:16:11.640,Okay.
00:16:11.640,00:16:15.280,Hmph. I was looking forward to having a bit of jelly myself.
00:16:15.280,00:16:16.520,Oh.
00:16:16.520,00:16:20.240,"Nanny, we can't eat the picnic anyway."
00:16:20.240,00:16:23.600,Our space helmets are in the way.
00:16:23.600,00:16:25.320,That's the last straw.
00:16:25.320,00:16:28.640,"No water in the sea, and we can't eat food."
00:16:28.640,00:16:30.880,What kind of a picnic is this?
00:16:30.880,00:16:33.360,It's not a picnic!
00:16:35.480,00:16:38.240,Nanny Plum's right.
00:16:38.240,00:16:41.320,"Well, that's what I've been saying."
00:16:43.360,00:16:45.280,"Bye-bye, aliens!"
00:16:45.280,00:16:46.400,Bye!
00:16:46.400,00:16:49.320,ALL: Bye-bye.
00:16:49.320,00:16:51.200,I like aliens.
00:16:51.200,00:16:53.440,"Yes, they're lovely."
00:16:53.440,00:16:56.360,"Everybody, get ready for take-off."
00:16:56.360,00:17:00.320,I will set the controls for-- Oh.
00:17:00.320,00:17:01.480,What is it?
00:17:01.480,00:17:03.720,COMPUTER: Fuel tank is empty.
00:17:03.720,00:17:06.680,Ah.
00:17:06.680,00:17:08.160,What does that mean?
00:17:08.160,00:17:10.480,We are stuck on the moon...
00:17:10.480,00:17:13.320,forever!
00:17:13.320,00:17:14.600,"Oh, no."
00:17:22.440,00:17:25.040,"Oh, dear, that was a bit silly."
00:17:25.040,00:17:28.080,"Yes. Yes, it was very silly."
00:17:28.080,00:17:29.920,It's all because of your little elf rules.
00:17:40.160,00:17:43.200,I didn't mean to make so much magic jelly.
00:17:43.200,00:17:44.760,Magic jelly!
00:17:44.760,00:17:46.480,Of course.
00:17:46.480,00:17:49.560,"Nanny Plum, listen carefully."
00:17:49.560,00:17:54.040,I want you to put the magic basket into the fuel tank.
00:17:54.040,00:17:55.240,Why?
00:17:55.240,00:17:57.800,There's no time for questions.
00:17:57.800,00:17:59.520,Just do it.
00:17:59.520,00:18:04.360,"Here's the fuel tank, Nanny Plum."
00:18:04.360,00:18:07.840,Now ask the magic basket for jelly.
00:18:07.840,00:18:09.160,What?
00:18:09.160,00:18:12.400,"But you said no more magic jelly, remember?"
00:18:18.640,00:18:21.120,A lot.
00:18:21.120,00:18:23.200,What? How will that help?
00:18:23.200,00:18:27.440,The jelly comes out of the magic basket at amazing speed.
00:18:28.920,00:18:34.800,We can use the power of jelly to make the rocket fly back home.
00:18:34.800,00:18:37.680,If I'd said that you'd say I was being silly.
00:18:37.680,00:18:41.240,"But it's not you saying it, it's me."
00:18:41.240,00:18:45.440,"And the Wise Old Elf is very wise, Nanny Plum."
00:18:45.440,00:18:47.560,I suppose he is a bit clever.
00:18:47.560,00:18:50.000,"Okay, let's give it a go."
00:18:50.000,00:19:00.920,"Magic basket, please Jelly, Jelly Lots, lots, lots Oh, hang on, everyone."
00:19:14.000,00:19:15.520,Hooray!
00:19:20.560,00:19:23.000,MR. ELF: Elf rocket to control.
00:19:23.000,00:19:26.240,We are heading back to the Little Kingdom.
00:19:26.240,00:19:28.240,Using jelly power.
00:19:28.240,00:19:29.880,ALL: Hooray!
00:19:35.080,00:19:40.840,"Mr. Elf, please land the elf rocket in the Frog Pond."
00:19:40.840,00:19:43.360,Right-o.
00:19:45.680,00:19:47.560,Where are they?
00:19:51.120,00:19:53.200,"Stand back, everyone."
00:20:03.360,00:20:06.640,Launch the dinghy.
00:20:06.640,00:20:07.960,We're home.
00:20:07.960,00:20:10.080,"Welcome back, Ben and Holly."
00:20:11.680,00:20:14.360,We flew to the moon and back.
00:20:14.360,00:20:17.120,The mission was a complete success.
00:20:17.120,00:20:20.200,Thanks to the wonders of elf cleverness.
00:20:20.200,00:20:22.320,"Thanks to my magic jelly, you mean."
00:20:22.320,00:20:25.040,What?
00:20:26.880,00:20:28.360,"Now, now, Nanny."
00:20:28.360,00:20:31.080,Let's not argue over the little details.
00:20:31.080,00:20:37.480,Let's just say elf skill got us to the moon and fairy magic got us home.
00:20:37.480,00:20:38.960,ALL: Hooray!
00:00:15.240,00:00:16.720,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:48.000,00:00:50.280,"Hello, Mrs. Elf."
00:00:50.280,00:00:51.920,"Hello, Princess Holly."
00:00:51.920,00:00:53.760,Can Ben come out to play?
00:00:55.120,00:00:57.840,Sounds like he's on his way down already.
00:00:57.840,00:00:59.480,"Hi, Ben."
00:01:07.160,00:01:09.960,Let's play Princes and Princesses.
00:01:09.960,00:01:11.320,Okay.
00:01:11.320,00:01:15.000,I can be the princess because I am a princess.
00:01:15.000,00:01:16.600,And I can be the prince.
00:01:16.600,00:01:19.880,Yes. I'll turn you into a prince by magic.
00:01:19.880,00:01:22.360,Can't we just pretend I'm a prince?
00:01:22.360,00:01:25.360,No. Magic is much better.
00:01:25.360,00:01:32.360,Abraca Zobbedy Oh. I seem to have turned Ben into a frog.
00:01:38.320,00:01:42.080,"Ben, if you can hear me croak."
00:01:43.400,00:01:48.160,Good. I'm going to get help.
00:02:00.520,00:02:03.560,"Nanny Plum, come quick."
00:02:03.560,00:02:05.920,I've turned Ben into a frog.
00:02:05.920,00:02:09.240,"Oh, good. You've been practicing your magic."
00:02:09.240,00:02:13.000,"No, no. It was an accident."
00:02:13.000,00:02:16.120,Ben is not happy being a frog.
00:02:17.920,00:02:21.920,Can you help me turn Ben into himself again?
00:02:21.920,00:02:24.280,"All right, now calm down."
00:02:24.280,00:02:27.280,I'll fetch my wand while you wait with Ben.
00:02:27.280,00:02:28.720,Okay.
00:02:38.160,00:02:41.160,"Oh, no. Ben's gone."
00:02:41.160,00:02:46.680,Now I'll never find Ben and he'll be a frog forever.
00:02:46.680,00:02:50.040,"Hi, Holly."
00:02:50.040,00:02:51.440,What's wrong?
00:02:51.440,00:02:56.280,"I've turned Ben into a frog, and he's hopped off somewhere."
00:02:56.280,00:02:59.080,Hmm. He'll be at the pond.
00:03:00.800,00:03:02.200,Of course.
00:03:02.200,00:03:04.360,"Come on, let's go and find him."
00:03:07.720,00:03:09.040,"Holly, look."
00:03:09.040,00:03:11.960,Yes. That must be Ben.
00:03:11.960,00:03:15.440,"Hello, Ben."
00:03:11.960,00:03:18.440,I hear you've been naughty and got yourself turned into a frog.
00:03:18.440,00:03:21.840,You really should have waited like I told you.
00:03:21.840,00:03:26.400,Yes. Poor Holly was really worried.
00:03:26.400,00:03:29.840,Oh. Maybe this frog isn't Ben.
00:03:29.840,00:03:33.240,Maybe that one looks a bit like Ben.
00:03:33.240,00:03:35.040,But so does that one.
00:03:38.080,00:03:40.320,They all look the same.
00:03:43.680,00:03:45.840,VIOLET: Look. One of them is wearing a hat.
00:03:49.160,00:03:52.160,Hmm. I think so.
00:03:52.160,00:03:54.520,Holly. Don't you know?
00:03:54.520,00:03:56.960,He's your best friend.
00:04:01.440,00:04:02.600,"Hi, Ben."
00:04:07.200,00:04:08.640,At last.
00:04:08.640,00:04:13.320,You've no idea what a time we've had trying to find you.
00:04:13.320,00:04:15.360,"Now, Ben, don't worry."
00:04:15.360,00:04:17.760,Nanny Plum will be here soon.
00:04:17.760,00:04:21.120,And she knows the spell to turn you back again.
00:04:25.920,00:04:30.320,"Uh, Violet, I think we should just wait for nanny."
00:04:31.680,00:04:36.000,Turning frogs back into elves is easy-peasy.
00:04:36.000,00:04:37.680,Watch this.
00:04:37.680,00:04:47.160,Zabbedy Zee Turn yourself Into whatever you be You see?
00:04:47.160,00:04:48.840,"Well done, Violet."
00:04:48.840,00:04:52.320,Argh. That was horrible.
00:04:52.320,00:04:55.280,And I was eating flies.
00:04:55.280,00:04:59.600,Oh. I don't think my spell is quite finished.
00:05:01.920,00:05:04.520,Ben's turned into a bird.
00:05:04.520,00:05:06.600,That wasn't meant to happen.
00:05:07.920,00:05:11.440,"HOLLY: Now we will never, ever find him."
00:05:14.400,00:05:16.120,"Hi, Holly and Violet."
00:05:16.120,00:05:17.960,"BOTH: Hello, Barnaby."
00:05:17.960,00:05:19.480,Have you seen Ben?
00:05:19.480,00:05:22.160,I want to play football with him.
00:05:22.160,00:05:27.520,"Uh, I don't think you can play football with a bird."
00:05:27.520,00:05:28.680,Bird?
00:05:28.680,00:05:32.440,Yes. Violet turned Ben into a bird.
00:05:32.440,00:05:35.440,You changed him into a frog first.
00:05:35.440,00:05:40.960,"Well, anyway, now he's flown away and we will never find him."
00:05:40.960,00:05:43.040,It's very annoying.
00:05:46.320,00:05:50.160,So we need to look up in the trees.
00:05:51.360,00:05:52.800,BARNABY: Strange.
00:05:56.840,00:05:58.560,ALL: That's Ben.
00:05:58.560,00:06:01.160,VIOLET: But that nest is very high.
00:06:01.160,00:06:04.080,And we're not allowed to fly high.
00:06:04.080,00:06:07.200,Then it's a lucky thing I'm around.
00:06:07.200,00:06:11.640,"Elves are very good at climbing, and I'm an elf."
00:06:20.520,00:06:22.560,"Ben, is that you?"
00:06:23.800,00:06:27.760,Easy now. Don't fly away.
00:06:30.760,00:06:32.280,HOLLY &amp; VIOLET: Hooray!
00:06:38.120,00:06:40.320,I've got a very good idea.
00:06:40.320,00:06:43.000,If we both do a spell together...
00:06:43.000,00:06:45.120,Yes. That would be fun.
00:06:45.120,00:06:51.720,BOTH: Abraca Zabbedy Argh. That was disgusting.
00:06:51.720,00:06:55.000,I was a little bird and I was eating worms.
00:06:55.000,00:06:59.840,"Oh, I don't think our spell is quite finished."
00:07:00.800,00:07:02.880,Ben's turned into a rabbit.
00:07:12.400,00:07:14.960,We're not having a good day.
00:07:14.960,00:07:16.920,What about poor Ben?
00:07:18.360,00:07:20.120,"Goodness me, Holly."
00:07:20.120,00:07:22.160,I've been looking everywhere for you.
00:07:22.160,00:07:24.000,"Sorry, nanny."
00:07:28.840,00:07:30.600,I see.
00:07:30.600,00:07:33.760,So where's this frog that needs to be turned back into Ben?
00:07:33.760,00:07:36.400,"Uh, here."
00:07:36.400,00:07:38.120,But that's a rabbit.
00:07:38.120,00:07:40.600,Ben was a frog.
00:07:40.600,00:07:42.320,Then a bird.
00:07:42.320,00:07:46.680,And now he's turned himself into a rabbit.
00:07:50.120,00:07:54.080,"Well, it just shows that you both need a lot more spell practice."
00:07:54.080,00:07:56.160,"BOTH: Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:07:56.160,00:08:00.560,Fairies of your age really should be able to get a simple spell right.
00:08:00.560,00:08:02.760,"BOTH: Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:08:02.760,00:08:05.000,Watch and learn.
00:08:05.000,00:08:07.480,When you turned Ben into a frog...
00:08:07.480,00:08:12.280,Abraca Zobbedy You should not have turned him into a bird.
00:08:12.280,00:08:17.320,Zabbedy Zee And certainly not into a rabbit.
00:08:17.320,00:08:23.920,"Abraca Zabbedy No. At the start, you should have made him Ben again."
00:08:23.920,00:08:28.600,Abraca Zobbedy Zabbedy Zee ALL: Hooray.
00:08:28.600,00:08:32.040,Phew. I'm glad that's over.
00:08:32.040,00:08:34.680,"You see, girls? It's easy."
00:08:36.440,00:08:39.080,Okay. Can I have another go?
00:08:39.080,00:08:43.400,"No. If anyone can do it, I want a go."
00:08:43.400,00:08:45.000,"Oh, all right."
00:08:45.000,00:08:47.400,"Holly, give Ben your wand."
00:08:47.400,00:08:51.000,But-- But elves don't do magic.
00:08:51.000,00:08:55.760,"I'd like to give magic a go, just this once."
00:08:55.760,00:08:57.800,"NANNY PLUM: That's the spirit, Ben."
00:08:57.800,00:09:00.240,"Uh, into frogs."
00:09:00.240,00:09:07.640,Abraca Zobbedy Phew. For a moment I thought Ben was gonna turn us into frogs.
00:09:07.640,00:09:14.240,Abraca Zobbedy It's no good.
00:09:14.240,00:09:16.560,Elves don't do magic.
00:09:16.560,00:09:22.560,"Hmm. Maybe you just need a teeny, tiny bit of magical help."
00:09:22.560,00:09:30.640,Tricky Trick Trick This young elf do magic There.
00:09:30.640,00:09:32.040,Into frogs.
00:09:38.040,00:09:39.480,Into birds.
00:09:39.480,00:09:44.960,Zabbedy Zee And into rabbits.
00:09:44.960,00:09:51.080,Abraca Zabbedy There. All finished.
00:09:51.080,00:09:52.440,"Very good, Ben."
00:09:52.440,00:09:54.480,But haven't you forgotten something?
00:09:54.480,00:09:55.840,"Uh, what?"
00:09:55.840,00:09:57.920,You need to turn them back into girls again.
00:09:57.920,00:10:00.000,Do I?
00:10:00.000,00:10:02.160,"Oh, okay then."
00:10:02.160,00:10:08.520,"Abraca Zobbedy Zabbedy Zoo Well done, Ben."
00:10:08.520,00:10:10.880,Did you two follow that?
00:10:12.440,00:10:14.520,I think so.
00:10:14.520,00:10:17.200,Good.
00:10:17.200,00:10:19.680,"Yes, please."
00:10:19.680,00:10:20.960,BOTH: No.
00:10:22.760,00:10:25.360,ALL: Yes. Football.
00:10:25.360,00:10:28.960,And the rules say no magic.
00:10:28.960,00:10:30.680,BOTH: Okay.
00:10:30.680,00:10:34.760,"Yes, I think we've had quite enough magic for one day."
00:10:39.200,00:10:45.960,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the little castle.
00:10:55.520,00:10:56.760,Food delivery!
00:10:56.760,00:10:58.760,"Hi, Ben."
00:10:58.760,00:11:02.120,"Hi, Holly."
00:11:02.120,00:11:04.000,He's very busy.
00:11:04.000,00:11:06.760,"Thank you, Mr. Elf."
00:11:10.720,00:11:13.000,"Bye, Holly."
00:11:17.400,00:11:20.160,"Daddy, are you busy?"
00:11:20.160,00:11:23.000,"I'm King Thistle, I'm always busy."
00:11:23.000,00:11:25.160,I have lots of important work to do.
00:11:25.160,00:11:28.600,You're not working now.
00:11:31.680,00:11:33.240,That's not work.
00:11:33.240,00:11:34.920,It is king's work.
00:11:36.520,00:11:39.800,Oh.
00:11:39.800,00:11:44.600,"Making speeches, shaking hands, and waving a lot."
00:11:45.920,00:11:49.080,That sounds fun.
00:11:49.080,00:11:50.280,"Of course, Holly."
00:11:50.280,00:11:51.800,"Oh, goody."
00:11:57.480,00:12:07.880,"Magic car, drive on Now, the first job for any king is waving."
00:12:07.880,00:12:11.080,"It's a bit boring, but you do it like this."
00:12:12.360,00:12:14.600,"Oh, look. It's the king."

00:12:23.920,00:12:26.280,Yes.
00:12:23.920,00:12:27.560,A good wave will work wonders wherever you go.
00:12:27.560,00:12:29.440,Where are we going?
00:12:29.440,00:12:33.400,"Nanny Plum, what's the first bit of work I'm doing today?"
00:12:33.400,00:12:36.880,"You're launching an elf boat, Your Majesty."
00:12:36.880,00:12:39.120,How do you launch a boat?
00:12:39.120,00:12:41.320,I'll show you.
00:12:45.520,00:12:49.000,"Princess Holly, and King Thistle."

00:13:00.200,00:13:04.480,"And I'm sure you'll have a lot of, uh, fun with it."
00:13:12.240,00:13:15.080,Oh. But where is the fairy juice?
00:13:18.720,00:13:21.360,"Sorry, Your Majesty, We're very busy today."
00:13:21.360,00:13:23.600,"Hi, Holly."
00:13:23.600,00:13:25.840,Got to dash.
00:13:25.840,00:13:27.960,"Bye, Holly."
00:13:29.480,00:13:34.280,I declare this elf boat well and truly launched.
00:13:34.280,00:13:36.480,ALL: Hooray! Hooray!
00:13:37.920,00:13:40.280,"Daddy, what do we do now?"
00:13:40.280,00:13:42.400,"We shake hands, and ask questions."
00:13:44.920,00:13:47.440,"Hello, and what do you do?"
00:13:47.440,00:13:52.120,"I hammer metal, Your Majesty."

00:13:57.160,00:14:00.360,"I'm the ship's cook, Your Majesty."
00:14:00.360,00:14:03.040,How very interesting.
00:14:04.440,00:14:06.400,And what do you do?
00:14:06.400,00:14:08.920,"I'm the captain, Princess Holly."
00:14:08.920,00:14:11.880,How very interesting.
00:14:11.880,00:14:15.000,"Daddy, can we ride on the boat?"
00:14:15.000,00:14:16.240,Please?
00:14:16.240,00:14:18.080,"Good idea, Holly."
00:14:18.080,00:14:20.480,I never get to try these things.
00:14:20.480,00:14:23.920,"Captain, would it be possible to ride on your boat, please?"
00:14:23.920,00:14:26.880,"It would be an honor, Your Majesty."
00:14:38.640,00:14:40.200,"This is nice, Daddy."
00:14:43.200,00:14:45.360,I don't know why I've never done this before.
00:14:45.360,00:14:48.440,"Would you like some lunch, Your Majesty?"
00:14:48.440,00:14:51.120,"Oh, yes. I am rather hungry."
00:14:51.120,00:14:53.320,Me too.
00:14:54.560,00:14:55.720,Telephone for Your Majesty.
00:14:55.720,00:14:57.800,Someone called Nanny Plum?

00:14:59.800,00:15:01.760,You're going to be late for your appointment.
00:15:03.320,00:15:05.480,Right away.
00:15:05.480,00:15:08.080,Nanny says I have to get back to work.
00:15:08.080,00:15:11.560,"Oh. But, Daddy, what about lunch?"
00:15:11.560,00:15:13.040,I know.
00:15:13.040,00:15:15.360,But there's more important king work to be done.
00:15:15.360,00:15:20.240,"But, Daddy, you're king."
00:15:21.440,00:15:24.400,"Ah, Holly, everyone thinks I'm in charge."
00:15:24.400,00:15:27.520,But really I get told what to do all the time.
00:15:30.480,00:15:32.480,"When are we having lunch, nanny?"
00:15:32.480,00:15:35.240,"There's no time for lunch, Your Majesty."
00:15:35.240,00:15:39.160,You have to judge a fairy fruit and vegetable competition.
00:15:39.160,00:15:41.720,"How do you do that, Daddy?"
00:15:41.720,00:15:43.400,"How do I do that, nanny?"
00:15:43.400,00:15:46.640,You pick the biggest.
00:15:53.920,00:15:58.040,ALL: Hooray! Hooray!
00:15:58.040,00:16:00.560,"Here are the finalists, Your Majesty."
00:16:00.560,00:16:01.920,This is a tomato.
00:16:01.920,00:16:05.000,"Aah. Very, uh, big."
00:16:05.000,00:16:07.480,And this a strawberry.
00:16:07.480,00:16:10.920,"KING: Also very big and, uh..."
00:16:10.920,00:16:12.080,Red.

00:16:21.680,00:16:25.160,"It all looks, uh, very big."
00:16:31.560,00:16:33.440,The tomato.
00:16:35.960,00:16:39.200,Or perhaps the strawberry?
00:16:40.800,00:16:42.560,"No, no, the tomato."
00:16:42.560,00:16:46.480,"Daddy, they keep using magic."
00:16:49.240,00:16:51.520,Yes.
00:16:51.520,00:16:55.840,Why don't we just see which one tastes the best?
00:16:55.840,00:16:57.640,What a good idea.
00:16:57.640,00:16:59.800,Let's taste them.
00:16:59.800,00:17:02.080,It can be our lunch.
00:17:02.080,00:17:05.400,"First the main course, the tomato."
00:17:09.040,00:17:11.040,Mm. Delicious.
00:17:11.040,00:17:14.520,"Now, for pudding, the strawberry."
00:17:14.520,00:17:18.320,Mm. Scrumptious.
00:17:18.320,00:17:19.600,"Yum, yum."
00:17:19.600,00:17:22.240,They're both so very tasty.

00:17:35.680,00:17:37.640,Well done. Jolly good show.
00:17:40.280,00:17:41.520,"Hi, Ben."
00:17:43.600,00:17:46.280,Bye.
00:17:46.280,00:17:48.800,Mm. That was delicious.
00:17:48.800,00:17:50.520,Now I'd like a little nap.
00:17:50.520,00:17:54.080,"I'm sorry, Your Majesty, there's no time for that."
00:17:54.080,00:17:55.920,"But I'm tired, nanny."
00:17:55.920,00:17:58.040,You must make another speech.
00:17:58.040,00:18:01.240,At the festival of elf and Fairy dancing.
00:18:01.240,00:18:06.720,"Oh. I don't know anything about dancing, How can I make a speech about it?"
00:18:06.720,00:18:09.200,"Daddy, I can do a speech."
00:18:09.200,00:18:12.440,I've been watching you do it all day.
00:18:12.440,00:18:15.680,Excellent.

00:18:37.600,00:18:40.520,That was the last delivery.
00:18:40.520,00:18:45.040,"You might have finished, Ben, but I'm still working."
00:18:45.040,00:18:48.800,"Holly, it's time for your speech."
00:18:56.080,00:18:58.720,Uh...

00:19:06.800,00:19:10.200,We have to sit still and not fall asleep.
00:19:25.160,00:19:27.240,How awful.
00:19:34.280,00:19:36.760,Even worse.
00:19:44.760,00:19:48.200,Very good. Very good.
00:19:48.200,00:19:51.480,"Come on, Daddy, let's dance."
00:19:51.480,00:19:54.800,"What? But I-- Well, all right."
00:19:54.800,00:19:58.480,Could you play something a little bit more modern?
00:19:58.480,00:19:59.880,Right-o.
00:20:13.800,00:20:17.440,"I like your work, Daddy."
00:20:17.440,00:20:21.320,"Ho, ho. You're right, Holly, king's work is fun."
00:20:29.240,00:20:32.520,Oh. That was a busy day.
00:20:32.520,00:20:34.920,"Ho, ho. Yes it was."

00:00:55.680,00:00:58.480,"Hi, Holly."
00:00:58.480,00:00:59.880,What is it?
00:00:59.880,00:01:01.400,BEN: It's a telescope.
00:01:01.400,00:01:05.400,You can see things that are really far away.
00:01:05.400,00:01:08.080,Wow. Can I have a go?
00:01:08.080,00:01:10.200,Okay.
00:01:11.400,00:01:14.120,I can't see anything.
00:01:14.120,00:01:16.040,Try twisting it a bit.
00:01:17.280,00:01:19.960,It still doesn't work.
00:01:19.960,00:01:22.520,"Why are you laughing, Ben?"
00:01:22.520,00:01:24.400,It's a joke telescope.
00:01:24.400,00:01:29.240,It gives you a black ring around your eye that makes you look really silly. Look.
00:01:30.760,00:01:32.600,Why did you do that?
00:01:32.600,00:01:35.560,"Ha, ha."
00:01:35.560,00:01:37.680,What's Elf Joke Day?
00:01:37.680,00:01:42.400,It's a special day when all the elves play jokes on each other.

00:01:44.680,00:01:46.440,"It is fun. Ha, ha."
00:01:46.440,00:01:49.360,Would you like one of my chewy sweets?
00:01:49.360,00:01:51.160,"Yes, please."
00:01:54.000,00:01:55.960,"That wasn't funny, Ben."
00:01:55.960,00:01:59.920,"Ha, ha. Sorry."
00:01:59.920,00:02:03.760,"No, thanks, I've had enough of your silly jokes."
00:02:03.760,00:02:05.240,"It's okay, Holly."
00:02:09.640,00:02:11.200,I promise.
00:02:17.680,00:02:20.440,That's my squirty water flower.
00:02:20.440,00:02:22.200,It's not funny.
00:02:23.640,00:02:25.160,It is funny.
00:02:25.160,00:02:33.600,"Zip, zap, zop Upside down, you silly elf Whoa!"

00:02:41.440,00:02:43.440,What are you doing upside down?
00:02:43.440,00:02:45.480,Help! Help!
00:02:45.480,00:02:49.200,"Princess Holly, is this your doing?"
00:02:49.200,00:02:54.000,It was Ben's fault.
00:02:54.000,00:02:59.400,Never use magic in anger.
00:02:59.400,00:03:01.200,"Sorry, Nanny Plum."
00:03:05.800,00:03:07.600,"Sorry, Ben."
00:03:07.600,00:03:09.000,Phew. That's better.
00:03:09.000,00:03:11.800,"Now, what's all this about jokes, Ben?"
00:03:11.800,00:03:14.640,It's Elf Joke Day.
00:03:14.640,00:03:17.240,"Oh, heh. I love jokes."
00:03:17.240,00:03:19.720,I don't think they're very funny.
00:03:19.720,00:03:23.000,"Ha, ha. You should learn to have a sense of humor, Holly."
00:03:23.000,00:03:25.280,"Come on, Holly, let's have some fun."
00:03:25.280,00:03:29.120,Yes. Today's lesson can be how to have fun.
00:03:29.120,00:03:30.400,Off you go.
00:03:30.400,00:03:32.240,"Oh, all right."
00:03:38.440,00:03:41.480,Boo.

00:03:55.920,00:03:57.720,Aah! A spider.
00:03:58.960,00:04:01.760,It's only a toy spider.
00:04:01.760,00:04:03.920,Dad gets it out every year.
00:04:03.920,00:04:07.640,Ho-ho-ho.

00:04:11.640,00:04:13.680,Aah! Mr. Elf.
00:04:13.680,00:04:16.880,"I'm terribly sorry, Princess Holly."
00:04:16.880,00:04:19.640,I hope we didn't startle you.
00:04:19.640,00:04:24.120,"Hee, hee."
00:04:27.720,00:04:32.200,Are you having a merry Elf Joke Day?
00:04:32.200,00:04:35.200,"Hee, hee."
00:04:38.880,00:04:43.680,I wish Nanny Plum was here.
00:04:43.680,00:04:47.320,"Oh, I didn't know Nanny Plum likes such things."
00:04:47.320,00:04:51.400,Yes. Nanny's got a really good sense of humor.
00:04:56.560,00:04:58.920,Ho-ho-ho. To the Elf Truck.
00:05:11.680,00:05:14.120,I'll tell Nanny Plum you're here.
00:05:14.120,00:05:16.640,"No, no, Princess Holly."
00:05:16.640,00:05:23.200,A joke should be a surprise.
00:05:23.200,00:05:27.880,Oh. I'm really busy.
00:05:29.200,00:05:34.640,Hello. What do you want?
00:05:34.640,00:05:36.760,What?
00:05:38.920,00:05:42.480,Why are you copying everything I say?
00:05:45.600,00:05:48.080,I haven't got time for this.
00:05:48.080,00:05:49.840,Silly old fool.
00:05:49.840,00:05:52.720,Silly old fool.
00:05:52.720,00:05:54.080,Oh.
00:05:54.080,00:05:56.240,I don't think Nanny found that funny.
00:05:56.240,00:05:59.160,I thought you said she liked jokes.
00:05:59.160,00:06:00.320,She does.
00:06:00.320,00:06:03.240,Let's try another one.
00:06:06.280,00:06:09.600,This is my favorite.
00:06:09.600,00:06:12.400,It's a little toy mouse.
00:06:13.640,00:06:16.400,Oh. Nanny Plum doesn't like mice.
00:06:16.400,00:06:21.160,Ho-ho-ho. She'll like this one.
00:06:28.080,00:06:30.880,"Ho, ho. We're ready."

00:07:04.960,00:07:08.240,Aah! Help!
00:07:11.760,00:07:15.440,"That was not funny, Wise Old Elf."
00:07:15.440,00:07:18.720,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Nanny Plum."
00:07:18.720,00:07:22.760,May I say how lovely you are looking today?
00:07:22.760,00:07:26.280,What?

00:08:09.600,00:08:12.640,I'm going to turn you into a snail.
00:08:12.640,00:08:16.640,"But, Nanny, you said never use magic in anger."
00:08:16.640,00:08:21.440,I'm not angry.
00:08:24.200,00:08:27.080,"Yes, and here's another joke."
00:08:27.080,00:08:33.240,Elf to snail Naughty Nanny.

00:08:51.600,00:09:05.080,"Well, Daddy, the Wise Old Elf played jokes on Nanny Plum, and she got angry, and did a spell on him, The Wise Old Elf was just having fun."
00:09:05.080,00:09:08.080,"Don't you have a sense of humor, Nanny Plum?"
00:09:10.000,00:09:13.600,"Nanny Plum, why did you turn him into a snail?"
00:09:13.600,00:09:17.360,"Um, it was meant to be a funny joke."
00:09:23.400,00:09:25.280,He doesn't look very happy.
00:09:25.280,00:09:26.920,I'm not surprised.

00:11:36.920,00:11:38.560,"What do you think, Ben?"
00:11:41.520,00:11:45.680,"Uh, maybe you could be a tiny bit smarter."
00:11:45.680,00:11:50.160,That is why I have ordered the Elf Tailor to make you some new clothes.
00:11:50.160,00:11:51.360,Hm.
00:11:53.040,00:11:55.480,Okay.
00:11:57.760,00:11:59.200,The Elf Tailor.
00:11:59.200,00:12:02.160,That's just the Wise Old Elf.
00:12:02.160,00:12:09.880,"I'll have you know, I'm not just the Wise Old Elf, I'm also a qualified tailor."
00:12:09.880,00:12:14.880,"Oh, I see, carry on then."
00:12:14.880,00:12:17.840,But hurry up.
00:12:17.840,00:12:22.480,"Uh, King Thistle's new clothes, Your Majesty."
00:12:22.480,00:12:24.200,ALL: Ooh.
00:12:24.200,00:12:25.720,Lovely.
00:12:25.720,00:12:27.440,But is this fashionable?
00:12:27.440,00:12:29.880,This is a classic cut.
00:12:29.880,00:12:34.080,"Made from the finest woolen fabrics, Your Majesty."
00:12:34.080,00:12:36.760,Ooh. Very nice.
00:12:36.760,00:12:41.280,"Uh, oh, please, don't prod it, Nanny Plum."
00:12:41.280,00:12:47.360,"It's a very delicate fabric, which means you must not clean it with magic."
00:12:47.360,00:12:50.160,"Yes, yes."
00:12:50.160,00:12:52.360,Goodbye.
00:12:53.880,00:12:56.640,"Can you see that speck of dirt there, Holly?"
00:12:59.080,00:13:02.280,"Nanny Plum, can you see that speck of dirt?"
00:13:02.280,00:13:04.360,Where? There?
00:13:04.360,00:13:06.480,No. There.
00:13:06.480,00:13:08.520,Oh.
00:13:10.880,00:13:14.080,You've made Daddy's new clothes dirty.
00:13:14.080,00:13:15.440,So I have.
00:13:19.080,00:13:21.560,"Nanny, have you got time to clean it?"
00:13:21.560,00:13:24.160,"Leave it with me, Your Majesty."
00:13:24.160,00:13:27.560,"Nanny Plum, can Ben and I help you?"
00:13:27.560,00:13:28.680,NANNY: Of course.
00:13:36.840,00:13:39.880,How are we going to clean it?
00:13:39.880,00:13:44.000,The Elf Tailor said we shouldn't use magic.
00:13:47.200,00:13:50.440,But the Elf Tailor said it was very delicate.
00:13:50.440,00:13:54.000,"Oh, what does an elf know about washing clothes?"
00:13:54.000,00:13:55.400,He makes them.
00:13:55.400,00:13:59.160,"He might make clothes, but he hasn't washed as many as I have."
00:13:59.160,00:14:01.640,We'll need lots of soap powder.
00:14:01.640,00:14:03.800,Are you sure this is a good idea?
00:14:03.800,00:14:05.760,Of course it's a good idea.
00:14:05.760,00:14:10.760,"Nothing clothes like better than a good, hot soapy wash."
00:14:10.760,00:14:15.680,"You know, as we're doing a wash, we should clean the King's old clothes as well."
00:14:15.680,00:14:17.880,His scruffy clothes?
00:14:17.880,00:14:19.080,Yes.
00:14:19.080,00:14:20.720,Okay.
00:14:29.240,00:14:30.520,HOLLY: Daddy.
00:14:30.520,00:14:31.960,Yes?
00:14:31.960,00:14:33.960,We're going to wash all your clothes.
00:14:33.960,00:14:35.240,Okay.
00:14:37.320,00:14:40.240,"Shoes and crown too, Nanny?"
00:14:40.240,00:14:44.560,NANNY: Why not?
00:14:49.120,00:14:51.400,"Here are the clothes, Nanny."
00:14:52.760,00:14:55.560,In they go.
00:14:58.640,00:15:00.920,NANNY: There.
00:14:58.640,00:15:02.200,Now we let the washing machine do all the work.
00:15:02.200,00:15:04.840,It's all very clever and scientific.
00:15:04.840,00:15:06.440,What's it doing?
00:15:06.440,00:15:09.720,That's the first wash cycle.
00:15:11.320,00:15:13.120,Now what's it doing?
00:15:13.120,00:15:15.200,It's rinsing all the soap out.
00:15:15.200,00:15:17.040,It's very clever.
00:15:21.120,00:15:22.920,Finished.
00:15:22.920,00:15:28.480,Yes. Now let's see if all that soap got that stain out.
00:15:28.480,00:15:31.920,"Oh, Daddy's crown is a bit bent."
00:15:31.920,00:15:34.640,And his shoes are all soggy.
00:15:34.640,00:15:38.680,"Oh, dear. Were the King's clothes always this small?"
00:15:38.680,00:15:40.880,They've shrunk.
00:15:40.880,00:15:42.680,QUEEN: Nanny Plum.
00:15:42.680,00:15:44.640,Are the King's clothes clean?
00:15:44.640,00:15:46.160,That's Mommy.
00:15:46.160,00:15:49.640,"Uh, nearly ready, Your Majesty."
00:15:49.640,00:15:52.800,"Nanny, what are we going to do?"
00:15:52.800,00:15:57.680,"Maybe when the clothes are dry, they'll go back to their normal size."
00:15:57.680,00:16:01.360,"Yes, Ben. I'll just do a simple spell to dry them."
00:16:12.440,00:16:29.160,"Abracadabra Make clothes dry Thunder and lightning Flame, and fire Nanny Plum, quick."
00:16:29.160,00:16:32.640,Our guests will be here any minute.
00:16:32.640,00:16:34.680,"Where are the clothes, Nanny Plum?"
00:16:34.680,00:16:36.920,And What's that smell?
00:16:36.920,00:16:41.560,"We washed Daddy's clothes, but they shrunk."
00:16:41.560,00:16:45.440,And then Nanny burnt them with magic.
00:16:45.440,00:16:47.320,My goodness.
00:16:47.320,00:16:50.360,"Daddy will have to wear his old clothes then, I suppose."
00:16:50.360,00:16:53.960,But we cleaned Daddy's old clothes too.
00:16:53.960,00:16:55.120,What?
00:16:55.120,00:16:58.480,"You mean, he has no clothes to wear?"
00:16:58.480,00:17:00.360,"Uh, yes."
00:17:00.360,00:17:03.040,Hello. Where are my clothes?
00:17:03.040,00:17:04.720,"Nearly ready, darling."
00:17:06.400,00:17:09.360,Nanny will bring you your clothes in a moment.
00:17:11.440,00:17:13.680,"Nanny, call the Elf Tailor."
00:17:14.840,00:17:16.280,Aah. Too late.
00:17:16.280,00:17:19.840,That's King and Queen Marigold.
00:17:19.840,00:17:21.560,What are we going to do now?
00:17:21.560,00:17:24.160,ALL: Um...
00:17:24.160,00:17:27.080,We can make magic clothes.
00:17:27.080,00:17:29.760,"Nanny, can you do that?"
00:17:31.080,00:17:34.760,"If you insist, Queen Thistle, but magic clothes can be a bit tricky."
00:17:34.760,00:17:37.960,KING MARIGOLD: Hello? Anyone there?
00:17:37.960,00:17:39.440,They're here.
00:17:41.520,00:17:43.440,I'll go and see to our guests.
00:17:43.440,00:17:46.880,"As you wish, Your Majesty."
00:17:46.880,00:17:49.960,"First, we need something to turn into shoes."
00:17:49.960,00:17:51.240,Lemons?
00:17:51.240,00:17:53.320,"No, they need to be shoe-shaped."
00:17:53.320,00:17:54.520,Aah.
00:17:54.520,00:17:56.720,Carrots.
00:17:57.840,00:18:03.000,Now we need something round and juicy for the jacket.
00:18:03.000,00:18:06.280,"No, a tomato."
00:18:07.760,00:18:10.840,Hm. What can we use for the crown?
00:18:13.800,00:18:17.160,"Ah, Holly, you remember King and Queen Marigold?"
00:18:19.840,00:18:24.360,"Hello. And this is my best friend, Ben Elf."
00:18:24.360,00:18:25.680,"Hello, Ben."
00:18:30.360,00:18:33.400,"Yes, nice and, uh, sensible?"
00:18:33.400,00:18:35.640,"Oh, is it the country look?"
00:18:35.640,00:18:37.000,Uh...
00:18:37.000,00:18:40.280,I think the way one dresses is very important.
00:18:40.280,00:18:42.440,My husband won't be a moment.
00:18:42.440,00:18:45.320,He's just changing into his new clothes.
00:18:49.600,00:18:53.440,"Uh, well, it is an experiment."
00:18:58.600,00:19:02.040,"Oh, ho, ho."
00:19:02.040,00:19:04.280,"Outstanding, oh."
00:19:04.280,00:19:08.120,"Really? Well, the jacket feels a bit soggy, actually."
00:19:08.120,00:19:09.920,It looks wonderful.
00:19:09.920,00:19:13.200,So fresh and exciting. Oh.
00:19:13.200,00:19:18.120,We were just saying how important it is to think carefully about what you wear.
00:19:18.120,00:19:21.240,"Oh, I don't think I think at all."
00:19:26.480,00:19:28.160,"Ooh, I say."
00:19:30.680,00:19:32.600,"Oh, what's that?"
00:19:32.600,00:19:36.480,Yes. I was worried that might happen.
00:19:36.480,00:19:39.320,"Tricky things, magic clothes."
00:19:40.760,00:19:44.400,"Silly Daddy, you've got a lemon on your head."
00:19:48.000,00:19:52.160,That is amazing.
00:19:52.160,00:19:55.400,I've never seen anything like it.
00:19:55.400,00:19:58.040,Absolute genius.
00:19:58.040,00:20:00.520,Self-transforming clothes?
00:20:00.520,00:20:02.560,I would never have thought of that.
00:20:02.560,00:20:06.800,And you say that you don't think about what you wear? Ha-ha-ha.
00:20:06.800,00:20:10.040,You know more about fashion than we ever could.
00:20:10.040,00:20:13.320,Where do you get your inspiration from?
00:20:13.320,00:20:14.960,"Ah, well, uh..."
00:20:14.960,00:20:20.880,"Now, tell me, have you ever considered teaching fashion? Oh."
00:20:21.720,00:20:23.720,Aah.
00:20:23.720,00:20:27.560,"Nanny Plum, could you make us something for dinner, please?"
00:20:27.560,00:20:31.200,"Of course, Your Majesty, I can make anything you like."
00:20:31.200,00:20:36.000,"As long as you don't want carrots, tomatoes or lemons."
00:00:18.200,00:00:21.360,And I'm Princess Holly.
00:00:22.360,00:00:24.360,"Come on, let's play."
00:00:35.720,00:00:41.400,Today's adventure starts at the little castle.
00:00:51.720,00:00:55.840,"Ah, what a lovely morning for a bit of wand practice."
00:00:58.160,00:01:02.160,"But, Nanny Plum, I was going to play with Ben."
00:01:02.160,00:01:07.480,"Princess Holly, there's a time for playing with elves, and a time for wand practice."
00:01:09.200,00:01:13.800,"Please, Nanny."
00:01:13.800,00:01:18.440,"Hm. Very well, but come in when I-- Thanks, nanny. Bye."
00:01:27.200,00:01:30.720,Oh. Where's Ben?
00:01:30.720,00:01:33.120,Ben?
00:01:34.840,00:01:39.760,"Oh, well. I suppose I could do some wand practice while I wait."
00:01:39.760,00:01:43.040,"Now, wand, what shall we do today?"
00:01:45.320,00:01:48.120,Yes.
00:01:49.160,00:01:58.520,Abraca zat A pretty hat Oh. It's not very pretty.
00:02:03.600,00:02:06.320,"Bye-bye, silly hat."
00:02:11.520,00:02:12.800,"BEN: Hi, Holly."
00:02:14.040,00:02:15.880,I'm practicing my magic.
00:02:15.880,00:02:17.720,Do you want to see?
00:02:19.280,00:02:21.440,"Uh, okay."
00:02:21.440,00:02:26.480,Stand very still.
00:02:26.480,00:02:33.160,Abraca zat Magic Ben a hat Oh.
00:02:35.040,00:02:38.080,Ben? Are you in there?
00:02:38.080,00:02:40.280,Oh! It's empty.
00:02:40.280,00:02:43.240,I've turned Ben into a hat.
00:02:45.360,00:02:47.440,Gosh!
00:02:47.440,00:02:49.720,"Uh, it's Ben."
00:02:49.720,00:02:53.360,I accidentally turned him into a hat.
00:02:53.360,00:02:54.960,Princess Holly!
00:02:54.960,00:02:58.240,That's exactly why you need to practice your magic more.
00:02:58.240,00:03:00.400,I was practicing.
00:03:00.400,00:03:03.440,But it all went a bit wrong.
00:03:03.440,00:03:06.160,I expect you waved your wand all over the place.
00:03:13.720,00:03:17.320,"Now, now, a good fairy never blames her wand."
00:03:17.320,00:03:18.960,"Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:03:18.960,00:03:22.720,"I've a good mind to leave Ben as a hat, just to teach you a lesson."
00:03:31.240,00:03:35.840,"Oh, very well."
00:03:35.840,00:03:42.280,Ding dong den Hat to Ben What happened?
00:03:42.280,00:03:45.440,"Uh, things went a bit wrong."
00:03:45.440,00:03:48.360,But Nanny Plum came to the rescue.
00:03:48.360,00:03:50.080,"Thank you, Nanny Plum."
00:03:56.960,00:03:59.760,"Yes, Nanny."
00:03:59.760,00:04:02.400,"Sorry, Ben."
00:04:02.400,00:04:06.480,I'm an elf.
00:04:08.000,00:04:11.480,"Good. In that case, can I try again?"
00:04:11.480,00:04:13.760,"Um, maybe later."
00:04:13.760,00:04:14.920,See you.
00:04:14.920,00:04:17.280,"Bye, Ben."
00:04:33.480,00:04:36.720,Princess Holly.
00:04:36.720,00:04:37.960,Uh...
00:04:37.960,00:04:41.000,Your wand. Where is it?
00:04:41.000,00:04:43.920,Oh.
00:04:43.920,00:04:46.000,"You haven't lost it, have you?"
00:04:47.440,00:04:49.520,Oh! I know.
00:05:07.040,00:05:10.560,I'm sure I left my wand here.
00:05:10.560,00:05:12.440,It's gone!
00:05:14.760,00:05:15.960,"Hi, Holly."
00:05:17.640,00:05:19.400,"Hi, Ben."
00:05:19.400,00:05:20.840,What's wrong?
00:05:20.840,00:05:22.560,I've lost my wand.
00:05:22.560,00:05:24.920,I can't do magic anymore.
00:05:24.920,00:05:27.840,Maybe that's a good thing.
00:05:29.320,00:05:34.360,I'm never going to find my wand and I'll be sad forever.
00:05:35.600,00:05:39.120,"Cheer up, Holly."
00:05:39.120,00:05:40.360,How?
00:05:40.360,00:05:44.480,"Elves are very good at finding things, and I'm an elf."
00:05:45.600,00:05:47.320,"Heh, heh."
00:05:45.600,00:05:53.640,"Thanks, Ben But if I find your wand, you must promise not to turn me into a hat again."
00:05:55.040,00:05:58.600,"But, Ben, how are you going to find my wand?"
00:05:58.600,00:06:00.600,I've got a simple plan.
00:06:00.600,00:06:02.520,"Oh, goody. Heh."
00:06:11.880,00:06:13.680,That's where I left it.
00:06:13.680,00:06:14.960,Ah.
00:06:14.960,00:06:17.280,What's the next bit of your plan?
00:06:17.280,00:06:18.760,Um...
00:06:22.720,00:06:25.600,I knew I'd never find it.
00:06:26.800,00:06:28.000,"Oh, look."
00:06:28.000,00:06:29.600,It's Gaston the Ladybird.
00:06:29.600,00:06:31.400,Maybe he can help.
00:06:31.400,00:06:32.600,"Hi, Gaston."
00:06:33.920,00:06:36.600,Can you help us find Holly's wand?
00:06:36.600,00:06:40.040,"It was here, and now it's not."
00:06:43.080,00:06:45.760,BEN: Gaston's good at smelling things.
00:06:45.760,00:06:49.040,He'll find your wand in no time.
00:06:49.040,00:06:51.640,Clever Gaston.
00:06:55.240,00:06:57.960,Oh.
00:06:57.960,00:07:00.320,He's looking up into the sky.
00:07:00.320,00:07:03.880,So that's where your wand has gone.
00:07:03.880,00:07:06.040,How?
00:07:06.040,00:07:08.760,Can your wand fly?
00:07:08.760,00:07:13.120,"My wand is magic, but I don't think it can fly."
00:07:13.120,00:07:16.640,"Well, it's up there somewhere."
00:07:16.640,00:07:20.280,If only it could talk to us and tell us where it is...
00:07:21.520,00:07:26.360,"It can't talk, but it can make a sort of tinkly sound."
00:07:26.360,00:07:28.720,Great! Could you call to it?
00:07:30.160,00:07:34.360,"Wand? Oh, Wand?"
00:07:38.920,00:07:40.800,That's my wand.
00:07:40.800,00:07:43.760,It's coming from up there.
00:07:44.840,00:07:46.240,It's a jackdaw.
00:07:46.240,00:07:48.920,HOLLY: And it's got my wand.
00:07:48.920,00:07:51.720,BEN: Jackdaws like shiny things.
00:07:51.720,00:07:57.400,"HOLLY: It's very high up, and I'm not allowed to fly high."
00:07:57.400,00:07:58.880,No problem.
00:07:58.880,00:08:00.320,I'll climb up.
00:08:03.280,00:08:05.240,"Be careful, Ben!"
00:08:05.240,00:08:11.400,"Don't worry, Holly. Elves are very good at climbing, and I'm an elf."
00:08:17.320,00:08:19.160,Nice birdie.
00:08:19.160,00:08:23.000,"Can we have our wand back, please?"
00:08:24.520,00:08:30.240,"Phew! That was lucky Wow, Ben."
00:08:30.240,00:08:33.080,Tricking the jackdaw to open its mouth.
00:08:33.080,00:08:35.960,I would never have thought of that.
00:08:35.960,00:08:37.680,"Uh, yes."
00:08:37.680,00:08:40.240,Elves are very good at that sort of thing.
00:08:46.960,00:08:48.040,Okay.
00:08:50.320,00:08:53.520,"Giddyap, Gaston!"
00:09:07.360,00:09:10.880,Nanny! Ben found my wand.
00:09:10.880,00:09:15.560,"That's very nice, but you really shouldn't have lost it in the first place."
00:09:15.560,00:09:17.200,"Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:09:17.200,00:09:21.080,"Now, Ben, I understand we have you to thank for finding Holly's wand?"
00:09:22.320,00:09:23.640,"It was nothing, really."
00:09:23.640,00:09:26.360,I think a reward is in order.
00:09:26.360,00:09:28.840,I hear you want a new magic hat.
00:09:28.840,00:09:30.000,Um...
00:09:30.000,00:09:33.520,Yes.
00:09:33.520,00:09:35.800,"No, please, don't bother."
00:09:35.800,00:09:37.600,"Stay very still, Ben."
00:09:37.600,00:09:41.200,"And, Holly, wave the wand gently."
00:09:41.200,00:09:43.200,"Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:09:51.040,00:09:53.080,It's all down to wand control.
00:09:54.560,00:09:58.160,"Ha, ha."
00:09:58.160,00:10:01.520,"Ben, thanks for finding my wand."
00:10:01.520,00:10:04.480,Sorry I didn't believe your plan would work.
00:10:04.480,00:10:09.640,And I'm sorry I didn't trust your magic hat spell.
00:10:10.880,00:10:15.360,The magic hat has turned Ben blue.
00:10:15.360,00:10:16.640,How do I look?
00:10:16.640,00:10:21.400,"Um, I think your old hat suits you better."
00:10:21.400,00:10:23.040,Me too.
00:10:23.040,00:10:26.640,Abraca zobbedy Aah!
00:10:29.120,00:10:31.880,"And it's nice to have you back, wand."
00:10:38.800,00:10:44.440,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the little castle.
00:10:50.760,00:10:54.440,Nanny Plum!
00:10:54.440,00:10:58.640,"So sorry, Your Majesty, but the elves haven't delivered the food yet."
00:11:03.120,00:11:05.160,"I could magic an egg, of course."
00:11:06.360,00:11:08.320,But real farm eggs taste much better.
00:11:11.680,00:11:14.200,"Very well, Your Majesty."
00:11:14.200,00:11:17.480,Abracadabra Uh...
00:11:17.480,00:11:23.600,Boiled eggy Smelly.
00:11:23.600,00:11:25.280,That's disgusting!
00:11:25.280,00:11:26.480,What is it?
00:11:26.480,00:11:27.840,It's a dragon's egg.
00:11:27.840,00:11:29.800,"Well, get rid of it."
00:11:31.520,00:11:35.560,I could magic a real chicken to lay an egg for you?
00:11:35.560,00:11:36.960,"No, don't."
00:11:36.960,00:11:39.040,I think I'll wait for the elf farm delivery.
00:11:39.040,00:11:41.280,"It might take some time, Your Majesty."
00:11:41.280,00:11:45.800,I am not leaving this table until I've had my egg.
00:11:45.800,00:11:48.440,"As you wish, Your Majesty."
00:12:00.280,00:12:01.640,"Hi, Holly!"
00:12:01.640,00:12:03.160,Food delivery!
00:12:03.160,00:12:05.720,"What kept you, Mr. Elf?"
00:12:05.720,00:12:08.600,King Thistle is waiting for his breakfast!
00:12:09.960,00:12:13.760,"We dropped a carrot on the way, and had to go back to pick it up!"
00:12:13.760,00:12:18.600,Okay! Let's get this food into the castle!
00:12:18.600,00:12:24.680,"Carrots, tomato, small lettuce!"
00:12:24.680,00:12:25.920,Oh!
00:12:25.920,00:12:27.120,Where's the egg?
00:12:27.120,00:12:28.360,Oh! The egg.
00:12:28.360,00:12:30.760,That's the one thing we need!
00:12:30.760,00:12:33.040,The King wants an egg!
00:12:33.040,00:12:36.200,We'll go straight back to the elf farm and get one.
00:12:36.200,00:12:38.520,"Holly, do you want to come with us?"
00:12:38.520,00:12:40.240,"Yes, please!"
00:12:40.240,00:12:42.840,"Nanny, can I go to the elf farm?"
00:12:42.840,00:12:44.000,"Okay, Holly."
00:12:44.000,00:12:46.520,You can make sure we get a good egg.
00:13:08.120,00:13:09.680,What's that buzzing noise?
00:13:11.280,00:13:14.040,It's Gaston the Ladybird!
00:13:14.040,00:13:15.480,Gaston!
00:13:15.480,00:13:17.640,We're going to the elf farm.
00:13:17.640,00:13:19.440,Do you want to come along?
00:13:39.440,00:13:41.400,"Hello, Wise Old Elf."
00:13:41.400,00:13:43.600,"Hello, Princess Holly."
00:13:47.880,00:13:50.760,You must wear this hard hat.
00:13:51.960,00:13:54.680,In case something falls on your head.
00:13:54.680,00:13:56.120,Ooh!
00:13:56.120,00:13:58.280,This way to the carrots.
00:14:04.600,00:14:05.920,BEN &amp; HOLLY: Ooh.
00:14:05.920,00:14:09.920,Stand clear!
00:14:09.920,00:14:11.520,ALL: Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
00:14:11.520,00:14:13.480,Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
00:14:17.440,00:14:19.120,Wow!
00:14:19.120,00:14:20.840,"Oh, hello, Princess Holly."
00:14:20.840,00:14:22.520,"Hello, Mrs. Elf."
00:14:24.240,00:14:25.440,This way.
00:14:25.440,00:14:26.720,Bye-bye.
00:14:26.720,00:14:27.960,HOLLY &amp; BEN Bye!
00:14:32.600,00:14:35.120,This is the lettuce patch.
00:14:35.120,00:14:37.440,BEN &amp; HOLLY Ooh.
00:14:37.440,00:14:38.680,Clear the area!
00:14:38.680,00:14:39.880,Clear the area!
00:14:39.880,00:14:41.240,ELF 1: Clear the area!
00:14:41.240,00:14:42.680,ELF 2: Clear the area!
00:14:42.680,00:14:44.800,Why have you got an umbrella?
00:14:44.800,00:14:47.200,We are going to make it rain.
00:14:47.200,00:14:49.200,With magic?
00:14:49.200,00:14:54.080,You don't need magic if you have a big watering can.
00:14:54.080,00:14:55.360,HOLLY: Wow!
00:14:55.360,00:14:58.960,Push ho! Push ho!
00:14:58.960,00:15:01.920,Push ho! Push ho!
00:15:05.760,00:15:10.440,"If you think that's amazing, wait until you see the tomato plants."
00:15:10.440,00:15:12.000,Ooh!
00:15:13.400,00:15:17.080,These are the tomato plants.
00:15:17.080,00:15:18.840,Wow!
00:15:20.000,00:15:24.000,I'm afraid we have tomato bugs.
00:15:25.400,00:15:29.520,Tomato bugs like to eat the tomato plants.
00:15:29.520,00:15:32.760,Go away! Shoo! Shoo!
00:15:32.760,00:15:34.800,Shoo! Shoo!
00:15:34.800,00:15:37.360,"Oh, they keep coming back."
00:15:37.360,00:15:42.000,Yes. If only we could find a way to get rid of them.
00:15:46.760,00:15:48.920,Gaston's scared them away.
00:15:48.920,00:15:50.240,Of course.
00:15:50.240,00:15:53.320,Ladybirds like to eat tomato bugs.
00:15:53.320,00:15:55.120,Clever Gaston.
00:15:55.120,00:15:57.640,You should be our chief pest controller.
00:16:04.840,00:16:06.640,Right-o!
00:16:10.480,00:16:12.320,Tomato!
00:16:15.480,00:16:17.680,That looks dangerous.
00:16:17.680,00:16:21.480,It is. That's why we wear these hard hats.
00:16:21.480,00:16:25.120,But there's another job that's really dangerous.
00:16:25.120,00:16:28.320,Ooh! What's that?
00:16:28.320,00:16:30.840,It can be quite scary.
00:16:30.840,00:16:32.280,I'm not afraid.
00:16:32.280,00:16:38.520,"It is possibly the most dangerous job in the world, for an elf."
00:16:38.520,00:16:40.440,What is it?
00:16:40.440,00:16:43.000,WISE OLD ELF: Collecting eggs.
00:16:46.680,00:16:47.960,WISE OLD ELF: Chickens.
00:16:54.400,00:16:57.880,"Wow! They're big, aren't they?"
00:17:02.480,00:17:07.960,And why it's very important to lock this gate.
00:17:11.160,00:17:12.920,"Ooh, exciting."
00:17:12.920,00:17:16.040,"Wait, Princess Holly."
00:17:20.520,00:17:23.000,HOLLY: These chickens don't look dangerous.
00:17:23.000,00:17:27.280,It's collecting eggs that's dangerous.
00:17:27.280,00:17:29.400,How do you collect an egg?
00:17:29.400,00:17:42.000,"An elf must run very quickly to the egg, pick it up and run away with it as quick as they can What happens if they're not quick enough?"
00:17:42.000,00:17:45.640,WISE OLD ELF: They get sat on.
00:17:46.840,00:17:49.120,"HOLLY: Oh, dear."
00:17:50.240,00:17:57.480,Now you see how important it is that the gate is locked at all times.
00:18:01.720,00:18:03.960,Aah! Catch that chicken!
00:18:09.760,00:18:11.600,A chicken's escaped!
00:18:13.480,00:18:15.720,Ho! Ho!
00:18:16.640,00:18:18.000,Catch that chicken!
00:18:22.240,00:18:25.280,"Quick, to the elf truck."
00:18:26.560,00:18:28.400,Follow that chicken!
00:18:51.000,00:18:53.520,"Oh, we've stopped."
00:18:53.520,00:18:56.680,"Oh, no! The clockwork has wound down."
00:18:56.680,00:19:00.440,"Quick, Holly, let's wind it up."
00:19:11.120,00:19:12.560,Oh. Hello.
00:19:12.560,00:19:16.680,Will somebody give me an egg?
00:19:21.240,00:19:23.880,I told you not to magic a chicken!
00:19:27.480,00:19:30.360,"Nanny, can you speak chicken?"
00:19:30.360,00:19:32.120,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:19:40.360,00:19:42.800,"So, what did it say?"
00:19:42.800,00:19:48.520,Mrs. Chicken said: Oh.
00:19:50.200,00:19:53.560,Look! There's our chicken!
00:20:02.440,00:20:05.760,Don't be silly.
00:20:08.520,00:20:10.560,The chicken's laid an egg.
00:20:10.560,00:20:11.920,ALL: Hooray!
00:20:11.920,00:20:13.640,Hooray!
00:20:13.640,00:20:14.920,"Hm, yes."
00:20:17.120,00:20:19.440,Eh? What?
00:20:19.440,00:20:25.480,"Nanny Plum, could you ask Mrs. Chicken to deliver an egg for breakfast tomorrow?"
00:20:25.480,00:20:27.880,"Certainly, Your Majesty."
00:00:24.440,00:00:26.640,Wait for us!
00:00:36.640,00:00:43.840,Today's adventure starts at the Great Elf Tree.
00:00:58.160,00:01:00.280,Yummy.
00:01:03.200,00:01:05.200,"Wow, Mom."
00:01:08.840,00:01:10.160,Okay.
00:01:10.160,00:01:12.520,"Splish, splash, splosh, sploosh."
00:01:14.880,00:01:16.960,That must be Holly.
00:01:21.320,00:01:22.680,"Hi, Ben."
00:01:22.680,00:01:26.200,"Hi, Holly."
00:01:26.200,00:01:28.360,Ooh! Can I help?
00:01:28.360,00:01:31.000,Fairies are good at making cakes.
00:01:31.000,00:01:34.200,"Of course, Princess Holly."
00:01:34.200,00:01:36.320,That's my favorite bit.
00:01:36.320,00:01:39.720,Splashing and sploshing the cake mixture.
00:01:40.920,00:01:45.040,"I'd like more stirring and less splashing and sploshing, please."
00:01:54.280,00:01:56.400,"Holly, maybe you should do the stirring."
00:01:56.400,00:01:58.920,"Okay, Mrs. Elf."
00:02:01.000,00:02:03.640,"MRS. ELF: Very good stirring, Holly."
00:02:03.640,00:02:06.640,It could have been a bit more splashy.
00:02:08.160,00:02:11.640,"MRS. ELF: Next, we put the mixture into the cake tin."
00:02:12.640,00:02:14.800,It looks really yummy.
00:02:14.800,00:02:17.280,Mm. Can we have one now?
00:02:17.280,00:02:21.320,"Sorry, Ben, I have to bake them in the oven first."
00:02:21.320,00:02:23.840,Can't we just cook them with magic?
00:02:26.640,00:02:30.440,These are elf cakes baked without magic.
00:02:30.440,00:02:33.200,But magic can bake them really quick.
00:02:33.200,00:02:34.920,I'll show you.
00:02:34.920,00:02:36.320,"No, thanks, Holly."
00:02:36.320,00:02:38.840,"Remember, elves don't do magic."
00:02:38.840,00:02:40.640,MRS. ELF &amp; BEN: And we're elves.
00:02:49.920,00:02:51.800,Are the cakes ready yet?
00:02:53.000,00:02:55.040,They haven't even started cooking.
00:02:55.040,00:02:58.880,Oh. Maybe Holly should use a bit of magic.
00:03:00.520,00:03:07.440,"I think a better idea would be if you two played outside for a bit, and I call you in when the cakes are ready."
00:03:07.440,00:03:10.520,Oh. Do we have to?
00:03:10.520,00:03:12.720,Just think of some fun games to play.
00:03:12.720,00:03:16.520,I don't feel like playing games today.
00:03:16.520,00:03:20.840,What nonsense.
00:03:27.840,00:03:31.800,I wish those cakes didn't take so long to bake.
00:03:31.800,00:03:33.840,Me too.
00:03:33.840,00:03:38.560,I suppose we might as well try playing a game.
00:03:38.560,00:03:42.600,Okay. How about tag?
00:03:42.600,00:03:44.000,All right.
00:03:44.000,00:03:48.920,"But you must play fair, no magic."
00:03:48.920,00:03:50.720,Okay.
00:03:50.720,00:03:51.960,You're it.
00:03:53.240,00:03:54.760,Can't catch me.
00:04:00.200,00:04:02.120,Can't catch me.
00:04:05.240,00:04:08.360,You're running too fast.
00:04:08.360,00:04:09.880,BEN: I can't help it.
00:04:09.880,00:04:13.600,"Elves are good at running fast, and I'm an elf."
00:04:15.440,00:04:17.240,It's not fair.
00:04:17.240,00:04:20.680,Fairies can't run as fast as elves.
00:04:20.680,00:04:24.200,"Okay, I'll hop on one leg."
00:04:26.000,00:04:27.760,Can't catch me.
00:04:33.240,00:04:37.320,"Okay, I'll stand still."
00:04:38.520,00:04:39.800,Got you.
00:04:42.520,00:04:45.680,My turn.
00:04:48.000,00:04:50.800,I'm going to catch you.
00:04:52.280,00:04:53.440,Can't catch me.
00:04:59.600,00:05:01.280,I'm not using magic.
00:05:01.280,00:05:05.080,I'm just flapping my fairy wings.
00:05:10.720,00:05:13.240,I'll never catch you.
00:05:13.240,00:05:17.520,"All right, I won't use my wings."
00:05:17.520,00:05:18.720,Got you.
00:05:21.320,00:05:22.960,Let's play a new game.
00:05:27.800,00:05:31.000,Yippee!
00:05:31.000,00:05:34.160,But no flying.
00:05:34.160,00:05:37.960,"Okay, no flying."
00:05:42.880,00:05:45.520,BEN: No looking!
00:05:45.520,00:05:50.280,Four...five...
00:05:55.480,00:05:59.560,Hm.
00:05:59.560,00:06:01.560,Not there.
00:06:10.520,00:06:16.000,"Hm. Ben, give me a clue."
00:06:16.000,00:06:17.480,Please?
00:06:17.480,00:06:19.400,BEN: You're very cold!
00:06:21.000,00:06:23.440,Getting colder!
00:06:23.440,00:06:25.440,Oh.
00:06:25.440,00:06:27.480,BEN: Warmer.
00:06:27.480,00:06:29.240,Hot.
00:06:29.240,00:06:30.720,Hotter and hotter!
00:06:33.840,00:06:35.040,Found you.
00:06:35.040,00:06:38.200,Oh! There's no one there.
00:06:38.200,00:06:40.520,BEN: Ice cold!
00:06:45.120,00:06:47.240,This is too boring.
00:06:47.240,00:06:51.280,I have better things to do with my time.
00:06:51.280,00:06:52.440,Here I am!
00:06:53.720,00:06:56.280,Found you.
00:06:56.280,00:06:58.600,"Good hiding place, eh, Holly?"
00:06:58.600,00:07:01.320,"It was... okay, I suppose."
00:07:01.320,00:07:05.280,"Elves always hide well, and I'm an elf."
00:07:07.160,00:07:09.000,My turn to hide.
00:07:09.000,00:07:13.760,"Remember, play fair and no flying or anything."
00:07:13.760,00:07:16.360,"No flying, I promise."
00:07:18.720,00:07:23.560,"One, two, three..."
00:07:30.600,00:07:36.960,"Hm. Ben said no flying, but he didn't say no magic."
00:07:38.800,00:07:39.920,"What do you think, wand?"
00:07:39.920,00:07:42.840,Shall we do a teeny bit of magic?
00:07:44.680,00:07:47.320,"No, wand, I'm sure Ben won't mind."
00:07:48.680,00:08:00.480,"Abraca dibbely dibble Make me invisible BEN: Coming, ready or not!"
00:08:02.160,00:08:03.440,Hm.
00:08:03.440,00:08:06.680,"HOLLY: Very, very, very ice cold."
00:08:06.680,00:08:08.440,Oh.
00:08:10.360,00:08:13.320,HOLLY: Colder than a polar bear.
00:08:13.320,00:08:14.840,Hm...
00:08:16.480,00:08:20.000,"Aha, I see."
00:08:23.040,00:08:25.080,You'll never find me.
00:08:25.080,00:08:29.080,I wonder where Holly can be?
00:08:29.080,00:08:32.400,Maybe she's not in the meadow at all.
00:08:34.320,00:08:38.920,"It's no good, Holly's hidden too well."
00:08:38.920,00:08:41.360,I'll never find her.
00:08:42.800,00:08:44.040,Found you!
00:08:44.040,00:08:46.440,Oh! How did you find me?
00:08:49.040,00:08:51.800,"Oh, I'm not invisible."
00:08:51.800,00:08:54.160,The magic's worn off.
00:08:54.160,00:08:55.680,Magic?
00:08:55.680,00:09:02.240,"Oh, um, I was just using a teeny bit of magic."
00:09:03.560,00:09:06.680,"Anyway, let's play a different game."
00:09:06.680,00:09:11.080,I promise not to use flying or magic.
00:09:11.080,00:09:15.720,Okay. Let's play a game of-- MRS. ELF: Ben! Holly!
00:09:19.800,00:09:21.440,"Oh, Mrs. Elf."
00:09:21.440,00:09:23.200,Do we have to come in?
00:09:23.200,00:09:25.440,Can we just play one more game?
00:09:25.440,00:09:28.200,"Well, I never!"
00:09:25.440,00:09:32.560,I thought a certain fairy princess and a certain elf found playing games boring.
00:09:32.560,00:09:39.400,"But, Mom, we've hardly been playing any time at all, and you said the cakes would take ages."
00:09:39.400,00:09:42.560,The cakes have taken ages.
00:09:42.560,00:09:43.720,Have they?
00:09:43.720,00:09:47.760,The time's whizzed by because you were enjoying yourselves.
00:09:47.760,00:09:49.120,Time does that.
00:09:49.120,00:09:50.840,BOTH: Oh.
00:09:53.200,00:09:55.440,"BOTH: Yes, please."
00:09:57.280,00:10:00.120,Mm. Delicious.
00:10:00.120,00:10:01.880,Mm. Yummy.
00:10:01.880,00:10:04.600,These cakes are the best.
00:10:04.600,00:10:07.000,And Mrs. Elf didn't even use any magic.
00:10:08.280,00:10:09.880,"Thank you, Holly."
00:10:09.880,00:10:13.080,I think it was your stirring that made all the difference.
00:10:15.720,00:10:17.600,Do you want to see a trick?
00:10:17.600,00:10:19.160,Okay.
00:10:19.160,00:10:21.840,I can make this cake disappear.
00:10:21.840,00:10:22.960,How?
00:10:22.960,00:10:26.040,I thought elves didn't do magic.
00:10:38.560,00:10:45.160,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the little castle.
00:10:58.040,00:11:01.400,"Daddy, you've blown our cards over."
00:11:01.400,00:11:04.800,"I can't help it, Holly, I'm very ill."
00:11:04.800,00:11:06.880,"You've jus got a cold, that's all."
00:11:06.880,00:11:09.960,"Uh, no."
00:11:09.960,00:11:11.840,It feels worse than that.
00:11:11.840,00:11:13.600,Daddy's a bit grumpy.
00:11:13.600,00:11:15.920,Daddy's always grumpy when he's ill.
00:11:20.160,00:11:26.280,"Darling, you know fairy magic can cure everything, except the common cold."
00:11:26.280,00:11:28.520,It's not a common cold!
00:11:28.520,00:11:31.640,"It's something serious, and it needs sorting."
00:11:31.640,00:11:34.760,"All right, I'll try a little magic."
00:11:34.760,00:11:47.360,Abracadabra Now I'm sneezing and I've got a stuffed-up nose.
00:11:47.360,00:11:50.600,"Sorry, but I told you magic wouldn't work."
00:11:50.600,00:11:53.200,Perhaps you should see the elf doctor.
00:11:56.520,00:11:58.600,"Yes, the King is ill."
00:11:58.600,00:12:02.640,Sneezing and a stuffed-up nose.
00:12:05.720,00:12:08.400,Thank you. Goodbye.
00:12:09.960,00:12:12.640,"You rest in bed, darling, and wait for the doctor."
00:12:12.640,00:12:13.800,Hm.
00:12:15.240,00:12:17.040,The doctor is here.
00:12:17.040,00:12:20.080,KING: That's just the Wise Old Elf.
00:12:20.080,00:12:22.760,I'm not just the Wise Old Elf.
00:12:25.720,00:12:27.040,"Oh, I see."
00:12:27.040,00:12:29.160,"Well, Doctor, I am not well."
00:12:29.160,00:12:33.320,"I keep sneezing, my nose is blocked up, and my head aches."
00:12:38.000,00:12:39.600,Aah.
00:12:39.600,00:12:46.360,"Now look up, look down and wiggle your feet Hm."
00:12:46.360,00:12:50.440,Now flap your arms like a bird and whistle.
00:12:53.240,00:12:55.400,Interesting.
00:13:00.760,00:13:07.160,What you have is a case of acute viral nasopharyngitis.
00:13:07.160,00:13:09.080,Aha! You see?
00:13:15.080,00:13:16.240,Is that all?
00:13:21.000,00:13:24.040,"Well, Doctor, can you make me better?"
00:13:24.040,00:13:28.200,"Uh, let me see what I've got."
00:13:28.200,00:13:30.840,Aah. this should do the trick.
00:13:30.840,00:13:32.440,Does it taste bad?
00:13:35.640,00:13:37.080,I'm not having it.
00:13:41.120,00:13:42.360,Oh.
00:13:46.280,00:13:50.000,Hm. That's interesting.
00:13:52.120,00:13:56.840,"Well, it does say cough mixture."
00:13:58.560,00:14:05.080,"I know a recipe that can cure all kinds of colds, whether they be common or not."
00:14:05.080,00:14:17.600,"Expanding hands, itchy ears, hairy teeth, smelly noses, baldness."
00:14:17.600,00:14:20.240,Aah! Here it is.
00:14:20.240,00:14:22.000,The common cold.
00:14:22.000,00:14:25.640,I just need to find the right ingredients.
00:14:25.640,00:14:27.600,"Can we help you, Nanny Plum?"
00:14:27.600,00:14:29.440,Of course.
00:14:29.440,00:14:31.480,"Uh, Nanny Plum."
00:14:31.480,00:14:33.600,What's in this medicine of yours?
00:14:33.600,00:14:38.800,"Oh, just blackberry juice, lemon and sugar, and a few other things."
00:14:38.800,00:14:42.000,"Nanny, what other things do we need?"
00:14:42.000,00:14:43.240,Let's see.
00:14:43.240,00:14:45.600,A dewdrop from a spider's web...
00:14:45.600,00:14:47.360,BOTH: Ooh!
00:14:47.360,00:14:49.520,The slime from a slug...
00:14:54.200,00:14:56.520,BOTH: What's that?
00:14:58.040,00:15:01.200,You'll never get Daddy to drink that.
00:15:02.320,00:15:07.760,"Oh, no, it would be most unfortunate if anyone were to drink this."
00:15:07.760,00:15:12.120,This is a potion for rubbing on his feet.
00:15:12.120,00:15:14.120,BOTH: Ooh!
00:15:15.640,00:15:21.400,Right. First we need a dewdrop on a spider's web.
00:15:24.880,00:15:26.400,"Stop, Holly!"
00:15:26.400,00:15:30.480,It's not a good idea to fly around Madame Spider.
00:15:30.480,00:15:32.000,"HOLLY: Why, Nanny?"
00:15:32.000,00:15:38.280,"The flutter of our fairy wings is like a fly, and she likes to eat flies."
00:15:41.280,00:15:42.480,Shh.
00:15:50.000,00:15:53.800,They have very smelly breath.
00:15:53.800,00:15:56.960,"Uh, excuse me, Madame Spider?"
00:15:58.160,00:16:03.680,Could we possibly collect a dewdrop from your lovely web here?
00:16:03.680,00:16:06.760,It is to make some medicine for the King.
00:16:08.200,00:16:11.080,"Madame Spider says, Yes."
00:16:11.080,00:16:12.960,"I'll get the dewdrop, Nanny."
00:16:12.960,00:16:16.920,"Elves are very good at climbing, and I'm an elf."
00:16:24.400,00:16:25.800,Hooray!
00:16:27.680,00:16:29.120,NANNY: Very good!
00:16:29.120,00:16:33.240,Now we need the slime from a slug.
00:16:37.000,00:16:38.440,Look! A slug.
00:16:38.440,00:16:42.000,"Holly, perhaps you could do the asking this time?"
00:16:42.000,00:16:49.640,"You might have to shout a little, though, because slugs cannot hear very well Why is that, Nanny?"
00:16:49.640,00:16:51.760,NANNY: Because they have no ears.
00:16:51.760,00:16:54.800,Can't we just take some slime from the ground?
00:16:59.640,00:17:01.280,It's not polite.
00:17:02.760,00:17:05.040,"Hello, Mr. Slug!"
00:17:06.400,00:17:08.240,Hello!
00:17:08.240,00:17:13.200,"Uh, my daddy, the King, isn't well."
00:17:13.200,00:17:19.640,We need some of your slime to make his medicine.
00:17:19.640,00:17:24.040,"Can we collect some in this jar, please?"
00:17:28.240,00:17:30.760,"I think that means, Yes."
00:17:35.600,00:17:38.360,Thank you ever so much!
00:17:38.360,00:17:40.320,"Well done, Holly."
00:17:40.320,00:17:42.200,Let's check our list.
00:17:42.200,00:17:43.480,A dewdrop.
00:17:46.400,00:17:47.840,"Here, Nanny Plum."
00:17:47.840,00:17:51.320,"Last of all, we need a frog burp."
00:17:55.120,00:17:56.960,"HOLLY: There's a frog, Nanny."
00:17:56.960,00:18:00.040,"Oh! Good morning, Mr. Frog."
00:18:01.240,00:18:04.720,"Would you be so good as to burp into this jar, please?"
00:18:08.200,00:18:10.480,Ugh.
00:18:10.480,00:18:14.360,"To make babies burp, you rub their backs."
00:18:14.360,00:18:17.120,"Okay, I'll rub the frog's back."
00:18:20.120,00:18:21.800,I can hear something.
00:18:27.160,00:18:29.120,HOLLY &amp; BEN: Hooray!
00:18:29.120,00:18:31.200,Back to the kitchen.
00:18:34.520,00:18:39.320,"Now, let's mix all the ingredients."
00:18:39.320,00:18:52.400,"Blackberry, sugar, lemon, dewdrop, slug slime, and finally, frog burp."
00:18:59.760,00:19:11.000,"Sugar and spice Glug, glug, glug Burp of a frog Slime of a slug That's going to taste horrible."
00:19:11.000,00:19:12.520,"No, Ben."
00:19:12.520,00:19:18.840,"Remember, it's a potion to rub on the feet, not to drink."
00:19:18.840,00:19:21.320,Nobody would drink this.
00:19:24.800,00:19:28.400,"Oh, my, that is bad."
00:19:33.440,00:19:36.240,And it tastes disgusting!
00:19:36.240,00:19:39.720,"Daddy, you shouldn't have drunk it."
00:19:40.960,00:19:43.240,You should have rubbed it on your feet.
00:19:43.240,00:19:44.480,What?
00:19:44.480,00:19:46.480,I wonder what will happen now.
00:19:46.480,00:19:48.480,Let's see what the book says.
00:19:51.200,00:19:52.680,KING: What is it?
00:19:52.680,00:19:54.200,Silly me.
00:19:54.200,00:19:57.600,It's not a recipe for cold medicine after all.
00:19:57.600,00:20:00.080,It's a cure for baldness.
00:20:08.960,00:20:10.600,Nanny Plum?
00:20:10.600,00:20:12.640,I think my cold has gone.
00:20:12.640,00:20:14.160,Hooray!
00:20:16.120,00:20:19.520,Oh! I seem to have caught the King's cold.
00:20:19.520,00:20:21.760,"Oh, poor Nanny Plum."
00:20:21.760,00:20:26.520,Now I'm going to take personal charge of getting you better.
00:20:26.520,00:20:28.240,"HOLLY &amp; BEN: Heh, heh! Can we help too?"
00:20:28.240,00:20:30.000,"Of course, you can."
00:20:30.000,00:20:31.960,The more the merrier.
00:20:33.480,00:20:36.360,"Please, that's not necessary, Your Majesty."
00:20:36.360,00:20:38.480,"Oh, but it is."
00:00:15.200,00:00:16.800,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:18.360,00:00:20.640,And I'm Princess Holly.
00:00:24.240,00:00:25.960,Wait for us.
00:00:47.120,00:00:52.360,"For today's nature class, we shall be studying the pond."
00:00:52.360,00:00:53.720,Ooh.
00:00:53.720,00:00:57.680,"Some creatures live on land, like elves."
00:00:57.680,00:00:58.920,Oh.
00:01:02.160,00:01:03.880,Ah.
00:01:03.880,00:01:11.520,"Others live in water and on land, like-- Frogs."
00:01:11.520,00:01:12.880,"WISE OLD ELF: Good, Ben."
00:01:12.880,00:01:17.000,Who can tell me what frogs like to eat?
00:01:17.000,00:01:18.280,Ice cream.
00:01:18.280,00:01:20.960,"WISE OLD ELF: Ho. Ho. No, Princess Holly."
00:01:20.960,00:01:25.400,Does anyone else know?
00:01:25.400,00:01:27.600,"WISE OLD ELF: Correct, Barnaby."
00:01:27.600,00:01:30.360,Frogs eat flies.
00:01:31.720,00:01:33.680,Ew.
00:01:34.880,00:01:37.760,Would you like to see where frogs come from?
00:01:37.760,00:01:39.080,Yes. yes.
00:01:39.080,00:01:41.240,Very well.
00:01:42.760,00:01:44.240,Here we are.
00:01:44.240,00:01:45.640,Ooh.
00:01:45.640,00:01:50.120,Frogs lay eggs called frogspawn.
00:01:50.120,00:01:52.480,They don't look like frogs.
00:01:52.480,00:01:56.240,Ho. Ho. We'll have to wait a few days to see.
00:01:56.240,00:02:00.800,"Now, who's going to look after our frogspawn?"
00:02:00.800,00:02:02.000,I will.
00:02:02.000,00:02:04.840,"Really, Princess Holly?"
00:02:06.400,00:02:08.000,Very well.
00:02:08.000,00:02:11.400,I'll help you take them home to the little castle.
00:02:11.400,00:02:12.840,"Hooray, heh."
00:02:29.760,00:02:32.240,Nanny Plum.
00:02:35.640,00:02:39.360,It was great.
00:02:39.360,00:02:42.200,And I've got some homework to do.
00:02:42.200,00:02:43.760,That's very nice.
00:02:43.760,00:02:45.400,"WISE OLD ELF: Hello, Nanny Plum."
00:02:45.400,00:02:47.280,Where do you want The frogspawn?
00:02:47.280,00:02:50.320,Goodness me!
00:02:50.320,00:02:54.280,"You always said I should learn more about nature, Nanny."
00:02:54.280,00:02:56.160,Yes...
00:03:05.120,00:03:09.480,"We learned all about frogs, and I've got some homework to do."
00:03:09.480,00:03:11.760,"That's nice, darling."
00:03:11.760,00:03:14.600,"Goodnight, Mommy."
00:03:17.440,00:03:19.640,Morning time.
00:03:22.760,00:03:24.640,"Good morning, frogspawn."
00:03:24.640,00:03:28.160,Oh. Where did those little fish come from?
00:03:31.800,00:03:33.720,"Hello, tadpoles."
00:03:33.720,00:03:36.760,"Uh, what are tadpoles, Nanny?"
00:03:38.560,00:03:41.320,They hatched from the Frogspawn.
00:03:41.320,00:03:42.680,Wow.
00:03:42.680,00:03:44.840,I'm a bit of an expert on frogs.
00:03:44.840,00:03:47.440,By tomorrow they'll have changed again.
00:03:47.440,00:03:49.880,Ooh.
00:03:51.240,00:03:57.520,"They start off as frogspawn, and then they get little fishy tails, and they're called tadpoles."
00:03:58.840,00:04:01.160,You seem to know an awful lot about frogs.
00:04:01.160,00:04:04.280,Nanny's teaching me all about them.
00:04:04.280,00:04:06.160,"Do you like frogs, Daddy?"
00:04:06.160,00:04:10.200,"Of course, as long as they keep to their pond and don't bother anyone."
00:04:10.200,00:04:12.880,They can be a bit slimy and disgusting.
00:04:12.880,00:04:14.840,Daddy.
00:04:14.840,00:04:16.760,"Goodnight, Holly."
00:04:19.560,00:04:21.560,Morning time.
00:04:24.520,00:04:27.000,"Good morning, tadpoles."
00:04:27.000,00:04:31.280,The tadpoles have got legs.
00:04:31.280,00:04:34.680,Wow. That's amazing.
00:04:34.680,00:04:36.040,"Yes, Holly."
00:04:36.040,00:04:39.080,But it'll be even more amazing later.
00:04:44.000,00:04:45.400,Mommy.
00:04:47.440,00:04:50.640,"What is it, Holly?"
00:04:53.080,00:04:56.040,I can't see my tadpoles anymore.
00:04:56.040,00:05:00.040,Tadpoles?
00:05:00.040,00:05:02.400,"Nanny, did you do a spell on them?"
00:05:02.400,00:05:05.600,"No, Holly."
00:05:07.240,00:05:11.000,"Oh, dear, I think the King has found them."
00:05:12.480,00:05:14.600,Where did this come from?
00:05:16.000,00:05:17.440,Ugh!
00:05:17.440,00:05:19.680,What a fuss over such a little creature.
00:05:21.720,00:05:23.480,My tadpoles!
00:05:23.480,00:05:27.480,"Your tadpoles have turned into frogs, Princess Holly."
00:05:27.480,00:05:29.880,Tadpoles? Frogs?
00:05:29.880,00:05:31.600,What on earth is going on?
00:05:31.600,00:05:36.320,"Daddy, I did tell you I had some homework."
00:05:37.640,00:05:40.200,"Here froggies, this way."
00:05:48.800,00:05:51.240,This is my room.
00:05:51.240,00:05:54.600,And these are my toys.
00:05:59.800,00:06:03.320,Croak. Croak. Croak.
00:06:03.320,00:06:06.760,Croak. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
00:06:06.760,00:06:10.400,Let's play hide and seek.
00:06:10.400,00:06:19.040,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten."
00:06:19.040,00:06:20.960,"Coming, ready or not."
00:06:26.480,00:06:27.720,Found you.
00:06:30.120,00:06:32.640,Let's play another game.
00:06:32.640,00:06:35.160,"Hop, hop, hop."
00:06:36.600,00:06:38.800,"Bedtime, Princess Holly."
00:06:38.800,00:06:46.440,"Nanny, say hello to my friends, Fluffy, Tiddles, Mopsy and Ben."
00:06:46.440,00:06:49.560,Um... Hello.
00:06:51.280,00:06:53.440,"Goodnight, froggies."
00:07:01.880,00:07:03.560,"Good morning, Ben."
00:07:03.560,00:07:05.480,"Are you coming out to play, Holly?"
00:07:05.480,00:07:07.080,"I'm a bit busy, Ben."
00:07:07.080,00:07:09.040,I'm playing with my frogs.
00:07:17.480,00:07:20.920,See you later.
00:07:27.000,00:07:30.800,"Do something about these frogs, please, Nanny Plum."
00:07:30.800,00:07:33.840,Hm. They do seem to be getting bigger.
00:07:33.840,00:07:35.320,And noisier.
00:07:35.320,00:07:39.040,"If they're smaller, perhaps they'll be quieter."
00:07:55.840,00:07:58.000,"Uh, maybe not."
00:07:58.000,00:08:00.040,Froggy froggy.
00:08:01.480,00:08:06.960,Frogs belong in water.
00:08:08.320,00:08:11.800,"Daddy says frogs belong in water, so..."
00:08:11.800,00:08:16.280,Let's magic the courtyard into a paddling pool.
00:08:22.560,00:08:26.800,Good. Now we can fill the courtyard with water.
00:08:26.800,00:08:36.040,"Water, water Splish splash splosh There you go, froggies, a paddling pool."
00:08:36.040,00:08:38.520,Daddy will be pleased.
00:08:45.040,00:08:47.880,That's odd.
00:08:55.760,00:08:59.000,"Oh, no! Sorry, froggies."
00:09:00.240,00:09:03.800,Did you do this?
00:09:03.800,00:09:08.600,"You said the frogs needed water, so I made them a paddling pool."
00:09:08.600,00:09:11.960,That's enough!
00:09:11.960,00:09:13.400,Oh.
00:09:15.320,00:09:18.640,Off you go. Shoo.
00:09:19.760,00:09:22.800,"Hi, Holly. Are you okay?"
00:09:22.800,00:09:28.360,"Daddy says I've got to send my frogs back to the pond, but they won't go."
00:09:28.360,00:09:33.240,Hm. What we need is a clever plan to move them.
00:09:33.240,00:09:36.040,Elves are very good at clever plans.
00:09:36.040,00:09:37.960,And I'm an elf.
00:09:39.080,00:09:41.760,"So, what is your clever plan?"
00:09:41.760,00:09:43.520,We'll play leapfrog.
00:09:51.040,00:09:53.320,How's this going to help?
00:09:54.800,00:09:56.120,Hoop-la.
00:09:56.120,00:09:58.800,"Look, they're following us."
00:09:58.800,00:10:01.640,Hoop-la.
00:10:01.640,00:10:04.880,HOLLY: Hoop-la.
00:10:07.000,00:10:09.760,"Here we are, the pond."
00:10:13.160,00:10:14.800,"Well done, Ben."
00:10:14.800,00:10:17.680,Thank goodness they're not in the castle any more.
00:10:17.680,00:10:20.400,But Daddy.
00:10:22.760,00:10:25.040,They'll come back to the castle one day.
00:10:25.040,00:10:26.520,Why?
00:10:31.880,00:10:33.680,Yippee-dee doo dah.
00:10:49.960,00:10:53.520,This way for the Elf Farm tour.
00:10:53.520,00:10:59.280,"Now, children, who can tell me where carrots come from?"
00:10:59.280,00:11:00.840,Carrots come from the Elf Farm.
00:11:00.840,00:11:02.840,"Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:11:02.840,00:11:07.760,Does any child know where carrots come from?
00:11:07.760,00:11:09.720,"Um, the Elf Farm?"
00:11:11.080,00:11:15.680,"Hard hats on, please, and step this way."
00:11:19.600,00:11:20.840,A sheep.
00:11:20.840,00:11:23.680,"No, Strawberry, not a sheep."
00:11:23.680,00:11:27.320,A chicken.
00:11:31.960,00:11:33.320,So you see...
00:11:33.320,00:11:37.440,The Elf Farm gives us all the food we need.
00:11:37.440,00:11:39.400,What about milk?
00:11:39.400,00:11:42.600,Milk comes from very big animals.
00:11:42.600,00:11:43.760,Elephants?
00:11:43.760,00:11:45.720,"WISE OLD ELF: No, not elephants."
00:11:55.040,00:11:58.920,Can we go to the Big Farm?
00:11:58.920,00:12:00.120,"No, no, no."
00:12:00.120,00:12:05.680,The Big Farm is far too dangerous for elves and fairies to visit.
00:12:09.120,00:12:12.320,And what would a fairy know about animals?
00:12:12.320,00:12:14.760,"Fairies love animals, don't we, girls?"
00:12:14.760,00:12:15.960,Mm.
00:12:15.960,00:12:17.640,"Especially fluffy, little kittens."
00:12:17.640,00:12:19.480,ALL: Ah.
00:12:19.480,00:12:22.800,Hm. The Big Farm is full of big animals!
00:12:22.800,00:12:25.840,And big people with big feet.
00:12:30.360,00:12:31.880,KIDS: Me. Me. Me.
00:12:31.880,00:12:33.920,Righty-ho.
00:12:36.640,00:12:38.560,"Ahem, yes."
00:12:38.560,00:12:43.280,"Uh, today we'll be going to the Big Farm to learn about cows."
00:12:44.480,00:12:47.240,I'm not sure if the ladybird should come with us.
00:12:47.240,00:12:49.200,"Please, Wise Old Elf."
00:12:49.200,00:12:50.520,Oh. Very well.
00:12:50.520,00:12:52.880,As long as he behaves himself.
00:12:54.960,00:12:57.440,Gaston likes you.
00:12:57.440,00:13:00.120,"Hm. Charmed, I'm sure."
00:13:14.760,00:13:17.480,"Here we are, The Big Farm."
00:13:17.480,00:13:20.240,Watch out for the cattle grid!
00:13:25.360,00:13:26.560,ALL: Ooh.
00:13:29.720,00:13:33.080,Big people have very big feet.
00:13:33.080,00:13:35.520,And you never know where they're going to step.
00:13:36.800,00:13:40.080,"With luck, we won't meet any big people."
00:13:40.080,00:13:45.120,"But if we do, please keep calm, no panicking."
00:13:45.120,00:13:48.360,Wise Old Elf?
00:13:48.360,00:13:49.560,Eh?
00:13:49.560,00:13:52.200,Big people!
00:13:52.200,00:13:55.440,Ooh. A little toy bus.
00:13:59.600,00:14:01.680,Oh.
00:14:04.200,00:14:06.120,She's just a little girl.
00:14:06.120,00:14:08.360,She's a very big little girl.
00:14:10.760,00:14:13.320,Hello.
00:14:13.320,00:14:15.720,Ooh. More little fairies.
00:14:15.720,00:14:19.600,I'll have you know I'm not a fairy. I'm an elf.
00:14:19.600,00:14:21.000,LUCY: Have you got wings?
00:14:24.600,00:14:29.560,Can you do magic spells?
00:14:29.560,00:14:32.000,"Oh. So, what can you do?"
00:14:32.000,00:14:36.440,Elves do...
00:14:36.440,00:14:38.200,ALL: And we're elves.
00:14:40.200,00:14:43.600,And we're fairies.
00:14:43.600,00:14:45.840,"Wands away, please, fairies."
00:14:45.840,00:14:48.560,A farm is no place for magic.
00:14:49.720,00:14:53.400,"As you can see, Lucy, this is a rather bossy elf."
00:14:54.600,00:14:58.480,"Lucy, we want to see where the milk comes from."
00:15:00.920,00:15:02.840,"Can you show us, please?"
00:15:02.840,00:15:04.360,Yes. Follow me.
00:15:09.720,00:15:13.560,"And we know what chickens give us, don't we children?"
00:15:13.560,00:15:16.120,Eggs.
00:15:16.120,00:15:17.680,"Hello, chickens."
00:15:17.680,00:15:22.040,Some fairies and elves have come to see you.
00:15:22.040,00:15:28.280,"Of course, chickens are quite stupid creatures because they are so big."
00:15:28.280,00:15:31.040,But I'm big and I'm not stupid!
00:15:31.040,00:15:34.720,"Uh, ahem, yes."
00:15:36.720,00:15:39.400,These are the sheep.
00:15:43.200,00:15:45.600,Eggs.
00:15:45.600,00:15:48.080,Sheep give us wool.
00:15:50.800,00:15:52.520,What did the sheep say?
00:15:52.520,00:15:54.800,Ahem. The sheep said baa.
00:15:57.680,00:16:00.640,“Baa” means baa.
00:16:00.640,00:16:05.800,Ahem. Sheep are really very stupid indeed.
00:16:05.800,00:16:07.600,But Rex is very clever.
00:16:07.600,00:16:09.280,Who's Rex?
00:16:14.240,00:16:16.240,Heh. Rex likes you.
00:16:16.240,00:16:18.120,"Charmed, I'm sure."
00:16:19.320,00:16:22.400,Rex is a sheepdog.
00:16:25.560,00:16:30.440,LUCY: Rex is rounding up the sheep and taking them safely into their pen.
00:16:31.640,00:16:32.880,Wow.
00:16:35.600,00:16:37.560,Gaston wants to have a go.
00:16:37.560,00:16:41.360,"You're too little to round up sheep, Gaston."
00:16:43.000,00:16:45.640,Whoa! What's that sound?
00:16:48.760,00:16:50.840,Heh. It's Bessie.
00:16:50.840,00:16:54.080,And who is Bessie?
00:16:54.080,00:16:56.720,KIDS: Ooh. A Cow.
00:16:59.520,00:17:00.800,Argh!
00:17:00.800,00:17:02.560,She likes you.
00:17:02.560,00:17:07.840,"Heh. Now, children, what does the cow give us?"
00:17:07.840,00:17:10.360,A big lick.
00:17:10.360,00:17:13.080,And what else?
00:17:13.080,00:17:14.560,Well done.
00:17:14.560,00:17:16.840,STRAWBERRY: But she hasn't brought any with her.
00:17:23.000,00:17:28.000,"It's okay, Bessie, I'll be very gentle."
00:17:30.160,00:17:32.560,KIDS: Wow.
00:17:32.560,00:17:36.360,"That's where milk comes from, a cow."
00:17:37.720,00:17:43.040,Another interesting thing about cows is they always sit down when it's going to rain.
00:17:43.040,00:17:44.880,"Ho, ho, Nanny Plum."
00:17:47.320,00:17:48.480,It's true.
00:17:48.480,00:17:50.880,Cows sit down when it's going to rain.
00:17:50.880,00:17:52.760,"Yes, yes."
00:17:59.360,00:18:02.480,I just felt a teeny drop of rain.
00:18:02.480,00:18:05.280,These are the cow's udders.
00:18:05.280,00:18:09.400,Yes. I definitely felt some rain.
00:18:09.400,00:18:11.760,"Uh, Wise Old Elf?"
00:18:11.760,00:18:15.200,Maybe you should get out from under the cow.
00:18:15.200,00:18:19.200,If only I could take a closer look...
00:18:19.200,00:18:20.440,Oof!
00:18:21.720,00:18:23.400,"Oh, dear!"
00:18:23.400,00:18:27.080,"It's raining, and I haven't got my umbrella."
00:18:27.080,00:18:29.200,What about the Wise Old Elf?
00:18:29.200,00:18:30.760,He's under a cow.
00:18:30.760,00:18:33.000,At least he's dry under there.
00:18:41.560,00:18:43.000,I'm sorry.
00:18:46.840,00:18:49.200,"Uh, Nanny Plum?"
00:18:49.200,00:18:52.760,"You may now use magic, if you wish."
00:18:52.760,00:18:55.120,I didn't think you liked magic.
00:19:00.400,00:19:11.040,"Abracazow Up you get, cow Now, what was I saying?"
00:19:11.040,00:19:14.400,The last thing you said was Argh.
00:19:20.240,00:19:22.880,"Thank you, Strawberry."
00:19:27.240,00:19:29.640,Everyone back on the bus!
00:19:29.640,00:19:32.920,"Lucy, you'd better go indoors."
00:19:32.920,00:19:34.360,But I can't.
00:19:34.360,00:19:37.720,I have to get all the animals into the barn first.
00:19:37.720,00:19:39.240,BEN: Rex can help.
00:19:39.240,00:19:42.440,"LUCY: But what about Bessie, and the chickens?"
00:19:42.440,00:19:46.600,Maybe I could try magicking them into the barn.
00:19:46.600,00:19:48.920,"Oh, no."
00:19:48.920,00:19:51.760,It's too wet for my wand to work.
00:19:56.840,00:19:59.560,It's not magic!
00:19:59.560,00:20:02.960,"He's copying Rex, the sheepdog."
00:20:06.880,00:20:09.680,Gaston's a sheep-ladybird.
00:20:09.680,00:20:11.720,KIDS: Clever Gaston.
00:20:13.360,00:20:15.680,Thanks for all your help!
00:20:23.560,00:20:25.200,Hooray for Lucy.
00:20:28.440,00:20:30.480,And elves!
00:20:30.480,00:20:32.200,ALL: Hooray...
00:00:35.760,00:00:42.800,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Great Elf Tree.
00:00:46.400,00:00:51.600,"Now, children, is everyone ready for the tour of the Elf Factory?"
00:00:51.600,00:00:53.360,ALL: Yes!
00:00:53.360,00:00:54.680,"This way, please."
00:00:58.040,00:00:59.720,All aboard!
00:00:59.720,00:01:02.720,"Next stop, level 99."
00:01:02.720,00:01:04.440,Hold tight!
00:01:05.600,00:01:07.200,ALL: Whoa!
00:01:13.160,00:01:14.400,ALL: Whee!
00:01:14.400,00:01:17.240,NANNY: Whoa!
00:01:23.000,00:01:24.640,Goodness me.
00:01:24.640,00:01:26.640,Look at all this rubbish.
00:01:26.640,00:01:28.240,Don't you ever tidy up?
00:01:28.240,00:01:30.840,"This isn't rubbish, Nanny Plum."
00:01:37.560,00:01:43.680,The plastic bottles are made into gloop.
00:01:50.520,00:01:57.040,The old tin cans are made into clockwork cogs.
00:02:00.400,00:02:06.440,And the old paper and card goes into the pulping machine.
00:02:08.720,00:02:18.840,"And get squished into flat sheets, which are folded into new boxes for our toys."
00:02:18.840,00:02:20.120,ALL: Wow!
00:02:20.120,00:02:21.680,That's very clever.
00:02:21.680,00:02:24.120,Elves are very clever.
00:02:24.120,00:02:26.200,ELVES: And we're elves!
00:02:30.280,00:02:31.600,Whee!
00:02:31.600,00:02:34.680,ALL: Whee!
00:02:34.680,00:02:41.720,The Elf Factory produces one new toy every second.
00:02:44.080,00:02:46.160,Does the Elf Factory stop?
00:02:46.160,00:02:48.000,Certainly not.
00:02:58.920,00:03:02.440,Oh. The Elf Factory's stopped.
00:03:02.440,00:03:05.040,"Slight problem I'm afraid, Wise Old Elf."
00:03:05.040,00:03:08.880,"We've run out of plastic, metal and old paper."
00:03:08.880,00:03:11.280,Let's just magic up some more.
00:03:11.280,00:03:14.000,No! Not magic.
00:03:14.000,00:03:18.480,We're elves and we-- Argh. Don't do magic.
00:03:18.480,00:03:20.640,"So, what are you going to do?"
00:03:24.440,00:03:25.920,ALL: Ooh!
00:03:28.280,00:03:31.560,To the Great Elf Tower!
00:03:31.560,00:03:34.120,What is the Great Elf Tower?
00:03:34.120,00:03:37.240,"Oh, it's a wondrous place."
00:03:37.240,00:03:38.920,I've never heard of it.
00:03:38.920,00:03:44.640,The Great Elf Tower gives us all the things we need to make toys.
00:03:44.640,00:03:46.640,How does it do that?
00:03:58.440,00:04:00.800,We're here!
00:04:02.160,00:04:07.320,Behold! The Great Elf Tower.
00:04:07.320,00:04:09.920,Where?
00:04:09.920,00:04:18.360,"What? Big people and fairies might call it a litter bin, but to us it is the Great Elf Tower."
00:04:22.840,00:04:24.960,These are safety clothes.
00:04:24.960,00:04:27.960,The Great Elf Tower can be very dangerous.
00:04:30.200,00:04:32.600,Here goes!
00:04:39.480,00:04:43.120,"Keep going, you're almost there."
00:04:46.000,00:04:49.320,Have you found lots of things for making toys?
00:04:49.320,00:04:52.080,"Uh, not yet, it's a bit dark."
00:04:52.080,00:04:55.440,I'll go down and take a closer look.
00:04:55.440,00:05:00.960,"Oh, dear, I think the Great Elf Tower is empty!"
00:05:00.960,00:05:04.640,"GIRL: Mommy, Daddy, can I have some more jelly, please?"
00:05:05.800,00:05:08.440,"Dad, I can hear big people."
00:05:10.480,00:05:14.800,Big people have very big feet.
00:05:16.240,00:05:17.680,"Come on, Rex."
00:05:17.680,00:05:19.920,That was a lovely picnic.
00:05:19.920,00:05:21.440,Let's tidy up.
00:05:21.440,00:05:22.640,"Okay, Dad."
00:05:22.640,00:05:24.320,I'll take the litter to the bin.
00:05:24.320,00:05:25.480,"Thank you, Lucy."
00:05:25.480,00:05:26.760,"Come on, Rex."
00:05:32.520,00:05:34.480,Huh? What was that?
00:05:34.480,00:05:37.040,"I said, get out of the bin!"
00:05:37.040,00:05:42.040,"It's not a bin, it's the Great Elf Tower."
00:05:42.040,00:05:45.680,"Just get out of there, you silly old elf!"
00:05:51.440,00:05:53.680,Ooh. A little fairy.
00:05:53.680,00:05:54.880,"Uh, hello."
00:05:56.040,00:05:59.040,"Ooh, and a smelly little fairy."
00:05:59.040,00:06:04.200,"I am not a smelly little fairy, I'm a smelly little elf."
00:06:05.560,00:06:07.880,It's that little girl we met at the farm.
00:06:07.880,00:06:09.720,Yes. It's Lucy.
00:06:12.240,00:06:14.240,We're having a picnic.
00:06:14.240,00:06:17.320,"Look, Gaston. It's Rex."
00:06:24.680,00:06:26.560,"Charmed, I'm sure."
00:06:28.080,00:06:31.200,You've brought all your friends from Fairyland.
00:06:31.200,00:06:35.640,"This isn't Fairyland, it's the Little Kingdom."
00:06:35.640,00:06:37.960,Load the Elf Trucks.
00:06:39.000,00:06:54.240,ALL: But why do you want all this stuff?
00:06:54.240,00:06:56.120,We use it to make toys.
00:06:56.120,00:06:58.920,LUCY: Wow! I love toys.
00:06:58.920,00:07:02.440,But what do you do with all the smelly stuff?
00:07:02.440,00:07:06.840,WISE OLD ELF: It makes lovely compost for the elf farm.
00:07:06.840,00:07:08.360,Back to the Elf Tree!
00:07:14.560,00:07:21.040,Let's get these down to the Elf Factory without delay.
00:07:22.720,00:07:25.320,Wow! Look at that tree.
00:07:25.320,00:07:27.840,There are little windows in it.
00:07:27.840,00:07:32.040,I wonder if there are any fairies inside.
00:07:32.040,00:07:33.800,Aah!
00:07:33.800,00:07:35.280,"It's all right, Mom!"
00:07:35.280,00:07:37.960,It's just our friend Lucy.
00:07:37.960,00:07:41.000,"Oh, uh..."
00:07:41.000,00:07:42.200,Hello.
00:07:42.200,00:07:46.200,Here's a little present to remind you of your visit.
00:07:46.200,00:07:49.840,"It's our latest toy, fresh from the factory."
00:07:49.840,00:07:51.680,"Wow, thanks."
00:07:51.680,00:07:53.800,Is this made from my rubbish?
00:07:53.800,00:08:00.680,Yes. That's why we're very grateful to you for putting rubbish in the Great Elf Tower.
00:08:00.680,00:08:03.240,What's the Great Elf Tower?
00:08:05.000,00:08:08.160,You're welcome.
00:08:08.160,00:08:11.640,I always thought fairies lived in castles.
00:08:11.640,00:08:16.000,"For the last time, we are not fairies."
00:08:16.000,00:08:17.480,ELVES: We're elves!
00:08:19.760,00:08:24.680,"I live in a castle, Lucy."
00:08:25.720,00:08:28.840,Wow! A real fairy castle.
00:08:29.760,00:08:31.360,Aah!
00:08:31.360,00:08:33.360,"It's okay, Daddy."
00:08:33.360,00:08:37.400,"It's only Lucy, the little girl."
00:08:37.400,00:08:40.560,"Ahem. Hello, Lucy."
00:08:40.560,00:08:42.960,Oh! Another little elf.
00:08:42.960,00:08:46.040,I'm not an elf.
00:08:46.040,00:08:48.480,"Nice to meet you, Your Majesty."
00:08:49.640,00:08:51.720,"MOTHER: Lucy, home time!"
00:08:51.720,00:08:53.800,Oh. I have to go now.
00:08:58.360,00:09:01.600,Don't you mean the Great Elf Tower?
00:09:03.840,00:09:06.560,"Hee, hee."
00:09:06.560,00:09:10.080,"Bye, Lucy. Come back soon."
00:09:13.800,00:09:16.840,"Oh, dear."
00:09:19.800,00:09:21.960,No petrol?
00:09:21.960,00:09:24.800,"Oh, I wish we could help them."
00:09:24.800,00:09:30.840,"Nanny Plum, maybe you could sort this out with a bit of, um, fairy thingy."
00:09:30.840,00:09:32.720,Fairy thingy? What's that?
00:09:32.720,00:09:37.080,You know. The stuff you do with your wand.
00:09:37.080,00:09:39.760,"Oh. Do you mean magic, Wise Old Elf?"
00:09:43.520,00:09:46.120,Very well. Magic it is.
00:09:46.120,00:09:58.240,"Thunder and lightning North wind blow Go, car, go go go There."
00:09:58.240,00:10:01.200,Just enough fairy dust to get them home.
00:10:01.200,00:10:05.760,"Aah. We've got no petrol, but the car's working."
00:10:05.760,00:10:10.160,Maybe this car is so modern it doesn't need petrol.
00:10:10.160,00:10:12.240,We'll ask at the garage.
00:10:12.240,00:10:14.200,"Bye, Lucy."
00:10:14.200,00:10:15.960,Come back soon.
00:10:15.960,00:10:19.040,Thanks for mending the car.
00:10:19.040,00:10:21.480,"Lucy, who were you talking to?"
00:10:21.480,00:10:24.200,I met some elves and fairies.
00:10:24.200,00:10:25.960,"Ha, ha. That's nice."
00:10:25.960,00:10:29.960,The car is shiny today.
00:10:29.960,00:10:31.360,It's fairy dust.
00:10:38.640,00:10:44.520,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the lake.
00:10:48.880,00:10:56.120,"Your Majesty, may I present the Elf Factory's latest toy."
00:10:56.120,00:10:58.360,The elf submarine.
00:10:58.360,00:11:00.680,"Ah, yes."
00:11:02.600,00:11:05.720,Does it float?
00:11:05.720,00:11:08.560,Allow us to demonstrate.
00:11:08.560,00:11:15.160,"We carefully chose this day to test the submarine, as there are no other boats on the lake."
00:11:15.160,00:11:17.440,"Hello, me hearties!"
00:11:17.440,00:11:20.200,"It's Redbeard, the Elf Pirate."
00:11:20.200,00:11:24.200,"Yo, ho, ho! Land ahoy!"
00:11:24.200,00:11:28.040,"Um, should the ship be leaning like that?"
00:11:28.040,00:11:30.520,NANNY: Maybe it's the weight of all that treasure.
00:11:30.520,00:11:32.000,She's sinking!
00:11:32.000,00:11:36.000,Abandon ship! Abandon ship!
00:11:37.840,00:11:41.240,Curses!
00:11:37.840,00:11:44.160,"Me ship and me treasure, gone down to the bottom of the sea."
00:11:44.160,00:11:45.480,How sad.
00:11:53.080,00:11:56.600,But what about Mr. Redbeard's treasure?
00:11:56.600,00:12:00.360,"Yes, me treasure."
00:12:00.360,00:12:05.560,If only we had some way of sailing underwater to look for it...
00:12:05.560,00:12:07.960,"Ah, if only..."
00:12:07.960,00:12:11.920,"Anyway, back to my submarine, there's a-- The submarine!"
00:12:11.920,00:12:13.880,We can use the submarine.
00:12:15.280,00:12:19.040,Hang on.
00:12:24.280,00:12:25.960,"Yes, it can."
00:12:25.960,00:12:28.240,It'll probably sink like a stone.
00:12:28.240,00:12:29.840,"No, it will not."
00:12:29.840,00:12:31.800,Good. That's that sorted.
00:12:35.600,00:12:38.640,"Thank you, Your Majesty."
00:12:35.600,00:12:40.800,But-- But-- I'll be needing a crew.
00:12:40.800,00:12:42.640,"Aye, aye, Captain Redbeard."
00:12:42.640,00:12:44.800,Can I come?
00:12:44.800,00:12:46.480,I'd better come too.
00:12:46.480,00:12:49.240,If there's any trouble I can use magic to help us.
00:12:49.240,00:12:51.640,"No, Nanny Plum."
00:12:51.640,00:12:54.600,There will be no magic on the elf submarine.
00:12:54.600,00:12:56.600,Because we're elves.
00:12:56.600,00:12:59.000,And elves don't do magic.
00:12:59.000,00:13:01.640,"Yes, we know."
00:13:01.640,00:13:04.320,Pieces of eight!
00:13:04.320,00:13:08.280,"Polly, my faithful friend, you'll have to wait here."
00:13:09.440,00:13:12.080,"Mr. Elf, steer the submarine."
00:13:12.080,00:13:13.240,"Aye, aye."
00:13:15.080,00:13:16.960,"BOTH: Aye, aye, captain."
00:13:20.640,00:13:22.040,What shall I do?
00:13:22.040,00:13:28.400,"Why, you just sit there and look pretty, my little mermaid."
00:13:32.880,00:13:35.680,I know this lake.
00:13:35.680,00:13:37.120,Are you a sailor?
00:13:37.120,00:13:40.240,I was a sailor.
00:13:40.240,00:13:41.520,Why not?
00:13:41.520,00:13:43.760,Big Bad Barry.
00:13:43.760,00:13:47.080,Who's Big Bad Barry?
00:13:47.080,00:13:54.960,"Only the biggest, gigantic-est, most enormous fish the world has ever seen."
00:13:54.960,00:13:57.280,He's eaten nine of Dad's boats.
00:13:59.600,00:14:01.760,I thought I was a bad sailor.
00:14:01.760,00:14:03.480,I'm not a bad sailor.
00:14:07.520,00:14:09.160,And bad.
00:14:13.480,00:14:17.000,MR. ELF: Dive. Dive. Dive.
00:14:21.280,00:14:24.520,Ooh. It's so pretty.
00:14:27.160,00:14:29.320,BEN: It's Redbeard's boat.
00:14:32.120,00:14:33.800,"Well spotted, Ben."
00:14:37.440,00:14:40.320,"Ho, ho! Now I can get me treasure back."
00:14:44.560,00:14:48.240,HOLLY: I love it.
00:14:48.240,00:14:51.320,And that big underwater cloud.
00:14:56.960,00:15:00.040,Shiver me timbers!
00:15:00.040,00:15:02.080,BOTH: It's so big!
00:15:03.680,00:15:05.360,Is it Barry?
00:15:05.360,00:15:09.320,It is. It's Big Bad Barry!
00:15:09.320,00:15:13.240,He's swimming towards Redbeard's boat.
00:15:13.240,00:15:14.520,"Oh, dear."
00:15:14.520,00:15:15.880,He's going to eat it.
00:15:15.880,00:15:19.040,No! Me treasure!
00:15:20.720,00:15:24.560,Did you see that?
00:15:24.560,00:15:25.880,Like it were a grape.
00:15:25.880,00:15:27.920,"Oh, what a shame."
00:15:27.920,00:15:29.280,Shall we go home then?
00:15:29.280,00:15:32.600,Go home?
00:15:32.600,00:15:34.760,"Well, we can't do much about that now."
00:15:38.040,00:15:44.400,"Unless you want to sail into Barry's stomach and take your treasure back, this adventure is over."
00:15:44.400,00:15:49.000,"You're right, me fruity pancake Mm."
00:15:49.000,00:15:50.360,"Take us home, Mr. Elf."
00:15:50.360,00:15:52.480,"Aye, aye, Captain Redbeard."
00:15:52.480,00:15:53.960,"Um, who turned out the lights?"
00:15:53.960,00:15:56.000,It's all gone dark.
00:15:56.000,00:15:57.440,Where are we?
00:15:57.440,00:15:59.920,Oh. We must have sailed into a cave.
00:15:59.920,00:16:03.120,Mr. Elf was chatting instead of looking where he was going.
00:16:03.120,00:16:04.320,I was parked.
00:16:04.320,00:16:08.400,"Well, we're somewhere strange, and no mistake."
00:16:08.400,00:16:13.440,And I'll shave me beard off if there's not something fishy going on.
00:16:13.440,00:16:16.080,"Turn on the lights, Mr. Elf."
00:16:16.080,00:16:19.160,"MR. ELF: Aye, aye, captain."
00:16:19.160,00:16:21.600,It smells fishy.
00:16:21.600,00:16:23.520,What a pong.
00:16:24.920,00:16:26.280,Look!
00:16:26.280,00:16:27.560,Me ship!
00:16:27.560,00:16:29.920,HOLLY: There are more boats as well.
00:16:29.920,00:16:31.480,Aah. It's Bunty.
00:16:31.480,00:16:34.640,The boat Big Bad Barry ate last winter.
00:16:36.920,00:16:38.680,And there's Fifi.
00:16:38.680,00:16:41.080,And Miss Boo Boo!
00:16:41.080,00:16:42.680,Uh...
00:16:42.680,00:16:46.720,If all those boats are inside Big Bad Barry...
00:16:46.720,00:16:50.280,Then we must be inside Big Bad Barry.
00:16:50.280,00:16:53.720,"By all that's wet and fishy, you're right."
00:16:53.720,00:16:56.320,We're in the belly of the big fish!
00:16:56.320,00:16:58.040,That explains the smell.
00:16:58.040,00:17:04.840,"Just think, all those years I tried to catch Barry, and now he's caught me."
00:17:04.840,00:17:07.800,HOLLY: How are we going to get out of here?
00:17:07.800,00:17:13.640,"If we could get Big Bad Barry to open his mouth, we could just sail out."
00:17:13.640,00:17:15.920,"Oh, very clever, Ben."
00:17:30.760,00:17:31.960,It's not my phone.
00:17:31.960,00:17:33.280,It's not mine either.
00:17:34.960,00:17:36.240,"Uh, hello?"
00:17:36.240,00:17:37.880,"Oh, hello, Nanny Plum."
00:17:37.880,00:17:39.680,"Uh, what's that?"
00:17:46.760,00:17:48.040,BOTH: Hooray!
00:17:50.080,00:17:52.920,They've been swallowed by a giant fish.
00:17:52.920,00:17:54.120,BOTH: What?
00:17:54.120,00:17:56.320,Are they okay?
00:17:56.320,00:17:58.920,Is my submarine all right?
00:17:58.920,00:18:00.880,"It's not scratched, is it?"
00:18:00.880,00:18:04.480,"Listen, clever clogs."
00:18:04.480,00:18:08.240,How can we get Big Bad Barry to open his mouth?
00:18:08.240,00:18:11.640,Someone needs to talk to the fish.
00:18:11.640,00:18:14.560,Nanny Plum can speak fish.
00:18:14.560,00:18:20.080,"Nanny Plum, you must tell the fish a joke and make him laugh."
00:18:21.400,00:18:25.080,"A very stupid idea, but an idea."
00:18:26.520,00:18:29.920,I'm going to tell Big Bad Barry a joke to make him laugh.
00:18:29.920,00:18:31.760,What utter nonsense.
00:18:31.760,00:18:34.200,It was the Wise Old Elf's idea.
00:18:35.480,00:18:40.160,Everyone back in the sub!
00:18:40.160,00:18:42.640,Hm.
00:18:42.640,00:18:44.640,I know. Ahem.
00:18:48.040,00:18:49.280,Hm?
00:18:53.560,00:18:54.800,Did it work?
00:18:54.800,00:18:57.600,I don't know.
00:19:01.600,00:19:03.480,Something's happening.
00:19:03.480,00:19:05.520,I think he liked the joke.
00:19:12.160,00:19:13.920,Full steam ahead!
00:19:25.320,00:19:26.920,It's a triumph!
00:19:26.920,00:19:28.880,ALL: Hooray!
00:19:28.880,00:19:32.160,So you got the treasure?
00:19:32.160,00:19:34.080,You got your boat?
00:19:40.920,00:19:43.600,"In that case, congratulations!"
00:19:43.600,00:19:46.040,Its a shame the treasure's lost.
00:19:46.040,00:19:53.680,"I know where it is, and no one will ever find it in the belly of Big Bad Barry."
00:19:53.680,00:19:55.040,That's true.
00:19:55.040,00:19:58.800,"Of course it is, me tasty little fruit tree."
00:20:00.760,00:20:05.160,"Nanny Plum, what was the joke you told Big Bad Barry?"
00:20:05.160,00:20:09.160,It was Where do fish keep their money?
00:20:09.160,00:20:13.040,We don't know.
00:20:13.040,00:20:14.520,In a riverbank.
00:20:17.880,00:20:24.240,"It's a bit of a rubbish joke, but then fish find the silliest things funny."
00:20:24.240,00:20:27.080,They have very small brains.
00:20:27.080,00:20:30.120,Where do fish keep their money?
00:20:30.120,00:20:31.560,"Oh, I get it!"
00:20:31.560,00:20:32.840,A riverbank!
00:20:32.840,00:20:34.200,"Oh, that's brilliant!"
00:00:15.200,00:00:16.880,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:35.760,00:00:43.240,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Great Elf Tree.
00:00:48.640,00:00:50.440,"Hi, Holly."
00:00:50.440,00:00:51.800,"Hi, Ben."
00:00:51.800,00:00:53.600,Coming out to play?
00:01:07.520,00:01:09.440,"Gaston, fetch."
00:01:17.240,00:01:18.480,What are you doing?
00:01:18.480,00:01:21.000,We're throwing sticks for Gaston.
00:01:31.160,00:01:33.720,"Hello, everyone."
00:01:33.720,00:01:35.280,Aah! What's that?
00:01:35.280,00:01:38.360,It looks like a tin arm.
00:01:38.360,00:01:41.480,"Gaston, where did you find this?"
00:01:46.640,00:01:48.640,ALL: Wow!
00:01:48.640,00:01:49.800,What's that?
00:01:49.800,00:01:51.520,It's a toy robot.
00:01:51.520,00:01:52.840,ALL: Ooh!
00:01:52.840,00:01:55.000,It's a bit broken.
00:01:55.000,00:01:57.000,We could mend it with magic.
00:01:57.000,00:01:59.600,"Uh, no, thanks, Strawberry."
00:02:01.560,00:02:05.000,Elves are very good at fixing things.
00:02:05.000,00:02:06.760,BOTH: And we're elves.
00:02:17.920,00:02:19.720,"There, finished."
00:02:22.480,00:02:24.840,So will it talk?
00:02:24.840,00:02:27.000,Will it make me a cup of tea?
00:02:27.000,00:02:29.560,"No, it's just a toy robot."
00:02:29.560,00:02:36.360,It'll do this: That's a bit boring.
00:02:38.240,00:02:40.800,That's what toy robots do.
00:02:46.000,00:02:48.360,It doesn't do anything.
00:02:48.360,00:02:49.640,ALL: Oh.
00:02:49.640,00:02:51.640,Maybe it needs batteries.
00:02:53.800,00:02:55.720,But there's no key.
00:02:55.720,00:02:57.040,I'll magic a key.
00:03:04.000,00:03:06.840,Magic can be dangerous.
00:03:06.840,00:03:09.360,I'm sure it will be okay.
00:03:09.360,00:03:11.920,"Whatever happens, it'll be fun."
00:03:20.400,00:03:21.600,"Shush, Gaston."
00:03:27.720,00:03:30.680,All: It's working.
00:03:30.680,00:03:34.080,"Master, what is your name?"
00:03:34.080,00:03:35.600,ALL: Ooh.
00:03:35.600,00:03:37.680,Is that what it's supposed to do?
00:03:37.680,00:03:39.360,I don't know.
00:03:39.360,00:03:42.200,"Uh, I'm Ben Elf."
00:03:45.840,00:03:55.800,We thought robots went: BOTH: Help! Help!
00:03:55.800,00:03:57.040,"BOTH: Oh, no!"
00:03:57.040,00:04:00.520,"Put us down, you silly robot."
00:04:00.520,00:04:02.200,Put the girls down.
00:04:02.200,00:04:07.000,"I only answer to my master, Ben Elf."
00:04:07.000,00:04:11.360,"Robot, uh, put the fairies down, please."
00:04:11.360,00:04:13.240,"Yes, Ben Elf."
00:04:14.840,00:04:16.080,Sorry.
00:04:16.080,00:04:18.200,That was a bit scary.
00:04:18.200,00:04:21.920,"Hm, it's not like a normal toy robot."
00:04:26.240,00:04:30.280,"But it seems to do what I say, so we should be okay."
00:04:30.280,00:04:32.440,"Hello, boys and girls."
00:04:32.440,00:04:34.560,"ALL: Hello, Wise Old Elf."
00:04:36.040,00:04:38.000,We've found a toy robot.
00:04:38.000,00:04:41.320,It was broken so we mended it.
00:04:44.640,00:04:50.440,"This is the old Mark Z-33, built by the elf factory."
00:04:50.440,00:04:54.320,"Hm, it was a rather basic model."
00:04:56.200,00:04:58.240,"Uh, please, don't get it angry."
00:04:58.240,00:05:00.640,"I beg your pardon, Ben Elf?"
00:05:00.640,00:05:02.960,You talk as if it can understand.
00:05:02.960,00:05:05.120,"Well, it does seem to."
00:05:05.120,00:05:08.000,It's just a toy robot.
00:05:16.640,00:05:19.640,You are a rude old elf.
00:05:19.640,00:05:21.080,ALL: Ooh.
00:05:21.080,00:05:25.040,"Robot, put the Wise Old Elf down."
00:05:25.040,00:05:27.400,"Yes, Ben Elf."
00:05:28.560,00:05:30.160,Very strange.
00:05:30.160,00:05:35.360,I-- I don't remember the Z-33 being able to talk.
00:05:37.160,00:05:39.240,ALL: It's escaping.
00:05:39.240,00:05:41.160,We'd better get it back.
00:05:50.360,00:05:54.440,What a beautiful sound.
00:05:58.000,00:06:00.160,Oh.
00:06:00.160,00:06:01.640,Where's it gone?
00:06:02.880,00:06:05.480,That sounds like Nanny Plum.
00:06:05.480,00:06:07.440,Help! Help!
00:06:07.440,00:06:11.440,"Robot, put Nanny Plum down."
00:06:11.440,00:06:13.600,"Yes, Ben Elf."
00:06:14.760,00:06:18.360,"Thank you, Ben."
00:06:18.360,00:06:20.760,It's just a toy robot.
00:06:20.760,00:06:23.920,But it does anything Ben says.
00:06:23.920,00:06:26.960,Really?
00:06:30.480,00:06:34.720,Must clean up. Must clean up.
00:06:34.720,00:06:37.440,Must clean up.
00:06:37.440,00:06:39.560,"It's very good, isn't it?"
00:06:39.560,00:06:42.040,I'd like one of those to do all my cleaning.
00:06:42.040,00:06:45.320,You can borrow my robot if you want to.
00:06:45.320,00:06:47.400,"That's very kind of you, Ben."
00:06:47.400,00:06:49.360,Maybe I'll borrow it just for this evening.
00:06:50.480,00:06:58.640,"Robot, I'm going home now, but I want you to stay here and tidy the castle."
00:06:58.640,00:07:00.640,"Yes, Ben Elf."
00:07:00.640,00:07:02.800,"Bye, everyone."
00:07:02.800,00:07:04.200,See you tomorrow.
00:07:11.680,00:07:15.840,Must tidy up. Must tidy up.
00:07:15.840,00:07:18.680,"My goodness, what's this?"
00:07:23.560,00:07:26.240,It looks like it's doing a very good job.
00:07:26.240,00:07:30.360,Must tidy up. Must tidy up.
00:07:30.360,00:07:34.720,"Hm, I think I prefer the traditional fairy way."
00:07:38.160,00:07:41.360,"ALL: Ah, dinner."
00:07:47.560,00:07:51.080,Must tidy up. Must tidy up.
00:07:51.080,00:07:52.320,Oh.
00:07:52.320,00:07:53.840,Must tidy up.
00:07:56.080,00:07:57.360,We can't.
00:07:57.360,00:08:00.400,The robot only listens to Ben.
00:08:00.400,00:08:02.200,"So, what can we do?"
00:08:02.200,00:08:06.520,"Uh, Ben told the robot to tidy the whole castle."
00:08:06.520,00:08:10.840,"So maybe we should go to bed, and let the robot finish."
00:08:12.480,00:08:15.800,The robot should have finished tidying by morning.
00:08:19.040,00:08:24.000,Must tidy up. Must tidy up.
00:08:28.600,00:08:31.840,What? Is it morning already?
00:08:31.840,00:08:34.400,Must tidy up. Must tidy up.
00:08:34.400,00:08:37.000,Put me down! Put me down!
00:08:38.920,00:08:40.120,Goodness me.
00:08:40.120,00:08:41.320,What's happening?
00:08:44.920,00:08:47.640,"Yes, including us."
00:08:47.640,00:08:49.960,It's a monster.
00:08:58.360,00:09:00.200,Hello? Mrs. Elf speaking.
00:09:01.800,00:09:05.000,"Sorry, it is a bit late, but this is an emergency."
00:09:05.000,00:09:07.200,"We need Ben, now."
00:09:07.200,00:09:11.640,"Ben, there's an emergency at the Little Castle."
00:09:11.640,00:09:13.520,We have to go right away.
00:09:13.520,00:09:14.840,Right-o.
00:09:19.400,00:09:21.400,Who's the best at rescuing?
00:09:25.440,00:09:28.280,ALL: We're elves!
00:09:28.280,00:09:30.520,It's the elves.
00:09:30.520,00:09:31.680,ALL: Hooray!
00:09:34.160,00:09:36.000,"Look, there's my robot."
00:09:36.000,00:09:39.160,Ah! Put me down!
00:09:39.160,00:09:40.600,Oof.
00:09:40.600,00:09:43.800,Ben Elf. Master.
00:09:43.800,00:09:47.440,Master. Master...
00:09:47.440,00:09:49.520,"Oh, it's wound down."
00:09:49.520,00:09:50.800,ALL: Hooray!
00:09:50.800,00:09:55.960,But what could have caused the toy robot to act so strangely?
00:09:55.960,00:10:01.000,"Uh, I think it was my magic key that did it."
00:10:01.000,00:10:04.520,"ALL: Ah, magic."
00:10:05.760,00:10:07.560,"What have you got there, Gaston?"
00:10:07.560,00:10:10.280,It's the proper key.
00:10:10.280,00:10:12.080,"BOTH: Well done, Gaston."
00:10:18.520,00:10:20.000,It'll be fine.
00:10:23.920,00:10:28.000,Ah. That's the toy robot I remember.
00:10:28.000,00:10:30.320,"Yeah, it's great."
00:10:38.680,00:10:45.040,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:10:56.280,00:10:57.840,I say.
00:10:57.840,00:10:59.480,I'm getting a little hungry.
00:11:03.240,00:11:05.480,"We don't have any fish, Your Majesty."
00:11:05.480,00:11:07.120,What? No fish?
00:11:07.120,00:11:09.520,But I can magic up some fish fingers.
00:11:10.680,00:11:13.720,"Yum, yum, I like fish fingers."
00:11:13.720,00:11:17.720,"No, no."
00:11:17.720,00:11:19.000,Fresh from the lake.
00:11:19.000,00:11:20.440,With chips.
00:11:20.440,00:11:21.640,I know.
00:11:21.640,00:11:24.240,Ben's dad has a fishing boat.
00:11:24.240,00:11:26.560,Then we shall go and see Ben's dad.
00:11:28.280,00:11:31.320,"It's time we put the boat away for the winter, Ben."
00:11:31.320,00:11:35.760,I'm pleased Bunty has made it through the summer with no accidents.
00:11:35.760,00:11:37.840,What kind of accidents?
00:11:37.840,00:11:40.840,The kind where the boat gets... eaten.
00:11:40.840,00:11:42.040,Eaten?
00:11:42.040,00:11:48.840,Yes. Have I never told you the story of Big Bad Barry the fish?
00:11:48.840,00:11:49.960,No.
00:11:49.960,00:11:52.640,It was a dark and stormy night.
00:11:52.640,00:11:57.040,"I was sailing in my favorite boat, when suddenly..."
00:11:57.040,00:11:59.840,"A fish, Mr. Elf."
00:12:01.520,00:12:03.360,With chips.
00:12:03.360,00:12:06.800,So we'd like you to take us out on the lake to catch one.
00:12:06.800,00:12:10.000,I was just putting Bunty away for the winter.
00:12:10.000,00:12:12.560,Who's Bunty?
00:12:12.560,00:12:15.400,"Well, one more trip won't do any harm, will it?"
00:12:15.400,00:12:16.920,I'd rather not.
00:12:16.920,00:12:19.280,"Um, she might get wet."
00:12:22.480,00:12:25.200,Okay. Climb aboard.
00:12:25.200,00:12:28.000,You'll have to leave your wands here.
00:12:28.000,00:12:30.600,Magic isn't allowed on elf boats.
00:12:30.600,00:12:32.360,BOTH: And we're elves.
00:12:39.720,00:12:41.080,KING: Let's get going.
00:12:41.080,00:12:42.720,I'll do the steering.
00:12:42.720,00:12:44.240,Hang on a minute.
00:12:44.240,00:12:49.320,"You might be King on land, Your Majesty, but on this boat I'm the captain."
00:12:49.320,00:12:51.280,So I'm in charge.
00:12:51.280,00:12:53.040,"All right, captain."
00:12:53.040,00:12:54.880,As long as I get a fish.
00:12:54.880,00:12:57.080,"Holly and Ben, wind the engine."
00:13:00.320,00:13:03.240,"King Thistle, take the wheel."
00:13:03.240,00:13:05.160,"Okey-dokey, captain."
00:13:06.840,00:13:08.920,"Ho, ho! This is fun."
00:13:12.240,00:13:14.200,Turn right.
00:13:14.200,00:13:15.840,Why didn't you say so?
00:13:15.840,00:13:18.800,At sea we don't say left and right.
00:13:21.560,00:13:23.120,Isn't that a bit silly?
00:13:24.440,00:13:26.600,We'll fish from the stern.
00:13:26.600,00:13:28.080,Where's that?
00:13:31.040,00:13:33.960,Come with me.
00:13:33.960,00:13:36.640,You must have the right type of bait.
00:13:36.640,00:13:39.960,What kind of bait are we using today?
00:13:41.400,00:13:42.960,Stale bread?
00:13:42.960,00:13:44.920,Who likes stale bread?
00:13:47.080,00:13:48.320,And jam?
00:13:48.320,00:13:52.040,"Yes, we're not gonna catch anything with stale bread, old boy."
00:13:53.520,00:13:58.400,"Stop! I'm the captain, so while we're aboard Bunty we do what I say."
00:13:58.400,00:14:00.600,"ALL: Aye, aye, captain."
00:14:01.880,00:14:03.960,Fish don't like noise.
00:14:03.960,00:14:06.280,"Very bossy, isn't he?"
00:14:07.960,00:14:10.360,This is so exciting.
00:14:10.360,00:14:12.280,"Shh, everybody."
00:14:12.280,00:14:14.480,Now we wait.
00:14:18.080,00:14:20.280,Are you sure this is right?
00:14:20.280,00:14:21.680,Of course I'm sure.
00:14:21.680,00:14:24.120,"Come on, let me have a go."
00:14:24.120,00:14:25.520,"Fine, you'll see."
00:14:34.800,00:14:36.560,"Well done, Daddy."
00:14:36.560,00:14:38.360,"Wow, it's big."
00:14:40.120,00:14:41.360,And I caught it.
00:14:41.360,00:14:43.120,It's only a little tiddler.
00:14:43.120,00:14:45.800,It must be the biggest fish in the lake.
00:14:45.800,00:14:48.480,It's too small.
00:14:48.480,00:14:51.760,That was the biggest fish I've ever seen.
00:14:51.760,00:14:54.000,I've seen bigger.
00:14:54.000,00:14:56.600,"Much, much bigger."
00:14:56.600,00:14:59.440,Really?
00:14:59.440,00:15:05.520,It was many years ago when I first met Big Bad Barry.
00:15:05.520,00:15:08.840,Big Bad Barry?
00:15:14.600,00:15:16.640,No.
00:15:16.640,00:15:18.720,It was a dark and stormy night.
00:15:28.640,00:15:31.880,I knew straightaway I had to catch him.
00:15:31.880,00:15:39.000,"I had to be the fisherman who took him home, for the biggest fish dinner in history."
00:15:39.000,00:15:43.240,I tried several different baits before I found what Barry liked.
00:15:43.240,00:15:44.440,Cheese.
00:15:44.440,00:15:46.200,Cheese?
00:15:46.200,00:15:47.480,MR. ELF: Cheese.
00:15:47.480,00:15:51.720,"I put a bit of cheese on the line, and Barry was hooked straightaway."
00:15:51.720,00:15:56.480,"The only thing was, he was stronger than my old boat Hilda was."
00:16:01.000,00:16:04.560,"And when he'd finished that, he ate her."
00:16:04.560,00:16:06.320,He ate Hilda?
00:16:06.320,00:16:08.320,It sounds horrid.
00:16:08.320,00:16:09.520,It was.
00:16:09.520,00:16:12.480,So you built Bunty to replace Hilda?
00:16:12.480,00:16:15.840,No.
00:16:15.840,00:16:17.240,Then Peggy.
00:16:17.240,00:16:21.040,"There was Abigail, Fifi, and Trixibelle."
00:16:25.320,00:16:27.680,Barry ate them all.
00:16:28.840,00:16:31.520,I tried to catch Barry so many times.
00:16:31.520,00:16:34.240,But he was always too strong.
00:16:34.240,00:16:37.040,So that's where all the cheese went.
00:16:38.800,00:16:41.920,Big Bad Barry is still out there.
00:16:41.920,00:16:43.160,Somewhere.
00:16:43.160,00:16:44.720,BEN &amp; HOLLY: Ooh!
00:16:44.720,00:16:46.120,Incredible.
00:16:46.120,00:16:48.440,I have come to a royal decision.
00:16:48.440,00:16:52.360,We must catch Big Bad Barry and have him with chips.
00:16:52.360,00:16:54.760,BOTH: Hooray!
00:16:54.760,00:16:57.080,I don't want to lose another boat.
00:16:57.080,00:16:59.240,Not Bunty.
00:16:59.240,00:17:01.360,"Anyway, there's no cheese on the boat."
00:17:01.360,00:17:02.520,I won't allow it.
00:17:06.680,00:17:10.040,Good! I've got some cheese in my picnic hamper.
00:17:10.040,00:17:11.720,We can use that.
00:17:12.960,00:17:15.520,Cheese on board!
00:17:15.520,00:17:19.120,"Quick, get rid of it, before it's too late."
00:17:19.120,00:17:20.720,What did you do that for?
00:17:20.720,00:17:23.680,I told you. It's dangerous to have cheese on board.
00:17:23.680,00:17:29.080,"Luckily, I also brought a nice Stilton cheese we can tempt Barry with."
00:17:29.080,00:17:31.600,No. I refuse to help.
00:17:31.600,00:17:33.680,Then we'll do it without you.
00:17:33.680,00:17:35.320,I'm taking charge.
00:17:35.320,00:17:36.560,BOTH: Hooray!
00:17:36.560,00:17:39.080,Aah! It's mutiny!
00:17:39.080,00:17:40.800,Mutiny on the Bunty!
00:17:43.160,00:17:47.360,We'll catch this Barry and have him with chips.
00:17:49.600,00:17:51.400,"Aye, aye, captain."
00:17:52.840,00:17:54.160,"Aye, aye."
00:17:54.160,00:17:56.840,"Here, Barry, Barry. Barry."
00:18:00.040,00:18:01.600,It's not working.
00:18:01.600,00:18:05.000,"Here, Barry."
00:18:06.240,00:18:09.880,"If we're going to catch Big Bad Barry, let's do it properly."
00:18:09.880,00:18:11.320,ALL: Yes.
00:18:11.320,00:18:13.520,"You must do what I say, as soon as I say it."
00:18:13.520,00:18:15.560,"ALL: Aye, aye, captain."
00:18:15.560,00:18:18.760,Big Bad Barry is too big for that rod.
00:18:18.760,00:18:20.360,We'll use this rod.
00:18:20.360,00:18:22.560,BOTH: Wow!
00:18:24.000,00:18:29.320,"You wanted to meet Big Bad Barry, here's your chance."
00:18:29.320,00:18:30.520,Excellent.
00:18:32.600,00:18:34.360,But not for long.
00:18:38.640,00:18:40.560,Mm.
00:18:40.560,00:18:43.160,HOLLY: Look!
00:18:45.000,00:18:48.440,MR. ELF: It's him! It's Big Bad Barry!
00:18:50.040,00:18:52.440,We'll be eating him for weeks.
00:18:52.440,00:18:54.080,MR. ELF: He's got the cheese.
00:18:56.360,00:18:59.840,Start the engine!
00:18:59.840,00:19:01.360,Full sail!
00:19:03.040,00:19:04.680,We're not going anywhere.
00:19:04.680,00:19:06.040,"Yes, we are."
00:19:06.040,00:19:08.640,Bad Barry is pulling us backwards.
00:19:08.640,00:19:10.720,Hang on!
00:19:18.080,00:19:21.000,We should never have tried to catch Bad Barry.
00:19:22.840,00:19:24.960,He's too bad.
00:19:30.440,00:19:32.880,Never!
00:19:36.440,00:19:37.960,I don't think so.
00:19:40.480,00:19:43.080,He's eating the line.
00:19:43.080,00:19:44.960,Aah!
00:19:44.960,00:19:46.160,I give in.
00:19:46.160,00:19:48.360,"Sorry we tried to catch you, Barry."
00:19:48.360,00:19:51.280,"No hard feelings, eh?"
00:19:51.280,00:19:53.440,He's eating Bunty.
00:19:53.440,00:19:56.400,Launch the lifeboat!
00:19:56.400,00:19:57.840,KING: Abandon ship!
00:19:57.840,00:20:02.840,"Women, children and kings first."
00:20:02.840,00:20:04.960,Poor Bunty.
00:20:04.960,00:20:06.760,"Hello, everyone."
00:20:06.760,00:20:08.640,The chips are ready.
00:20:08.640,00:20:10.520,Where's the fish?
00:20:12.520,00:20:14.880,Oh. What's going on?
00:20:14.880,00:20:18.440,Big Bad Barry is eating Bunty.
00:20:18.440,00:20:20.520,"Yum, yum, yum."
00:20:20.520,00:20:22.440,"Oh, dear."
00:20:22.440,00:20:24.640,Do you think Barry would like some chips with that?
00:20:24.640,00:20:28.080,I think he's full.
00:20:30.000,00:20:31.720,I knew her well.
00:20:31.720,00:20:34.040,Right. What shall we have for dinner then?
00:20:36.760,00:20:38.640,ALL: With chips.
00:00:10.160,00:00:15.320,"Everyone who lives here is very, very small."
00:01:39.280,00:01:41.720,"Ben, let's play catch."
00:01:41.720,00:01:44.080,"But, Holly, we haven't got a ball."
00:01:44.080,00:01:47.880,"That's easy, I can magic one up."
00:01:48.840,00:01:55.040,Abracadabra Abraca doo Magic a ball And make it blue.
00:01:56.120,00:01:58.360,Hm. Maybe not blue.
00:01:58.360,00:02:00.080,Red.
00:02:01.400,00:02:04.200,It's a bit small.
00:02:04.200,00:02:06.600,It's fine.
00:02:09.640,00:02:11.480,"Ha-ha-ha. To you, Gaston."
00:02:13.800,00:02:15.800,"To you, Ben."
00:02:15.800,00:02:17.880,"Oh, sorry."
00:02:26.080,00:02:29.800,"No, that's not our ball."
00:02:34.840,00:02:36.640,"So, what's this then?"
00:02:41.360,00:02:45.440,There's no trees here.
00:02:45.440,00:02:47.760,"Eggs don't fly, Holly."
00:02:47.760,00:02:50.080,Magic eggs might fly.
00:02:50.080,00:02:52.120,Hm...
00:02:52.120,00:02:54.760,Maybe it's a dragon's egg.
00:02:54.760,00:02:56.360,Hm...
00:03:01.680,00:03:03.640,I think that means no.
00:03:03.640,00:03:05.080,Oh.
00:03:05.080,00:03:08.720,I know.
00:03:08.720,00:03:10.280,Good idea.
00:03:24.120,00:03:26.320,"HOLLY: Nanny Plum, quick."
00:03:26.320,00:03:28.680,"Oh, goodness me, what is it?"
00:03:28.680,00:03:31.040,We've found a magic egg.
00:03:31.040,00:03:33.200,Or a dragon's egg.
00:03:33.200,00:03:36.600,"Come on, we'll show you."
00:03:38.280,00:03:42.880,Most interesting. An egg.
00:03:46.080,00:03:47.960,Hm...
00:03:52.960,00:03:54.800,That's not a magic egg.
00:03:54.800,00:03:56.720,Is it a dragon's egg?
00:03:56.720,00:03:59.400,"No, it's some sort of bird's egg."
00:03:59.400,00:04:03.680,Hello. What sort of bird's egg are you?
00:04:03.680,00:04:05.080,MAN: A blackbird.
00:04:05.080,00:04:06.720,It's a talking egg.
00:04:06.720,00:04:11.280,"No, it's me, the Wise Old Elf."
00:04:11.280,00:04:12.560,"Oh, hello."
00:04:12.560,00:04:15.120,"Good day, Mistress Plum."
00:04:15.120,00:04:21.960,"As I was saying, it is a blackbird's egg, and there's a baby chick inside."
00:04:21.960,00:04:23.320,How do you know?
00:04:23.320,00:04:25.480,You can hear it tapping.
00:04:25.480,00:04:27.280,Listen.
00:04:33.960,00:04:37.200,You must never collect the eggs of wild birds.
00:04:37.200,00:04:40.720,The place for an egg is with the mommy bird.
00:04:43.680,00:04:46.520,But the mommy bird's not here.
00:04:46.520,00:04:48.400,Then we must find her.
00:04:49.560,00:04:50.760,BEN: I know.
00:04:50.760,00:04:54.600,Gaston can follow the egg's trail and find the mommy.
00:04:55.800,00:04:57.920,Clever Gaston.
00:04:59.200,00:05:01.400,Gaston's good at smelling things.
00:05:04.960,00:05:06.680,BEN &amp; HOLLY: Oh.
00:05:06.680,00:05:09.600,I don't think the ladybird can follow the trail through water.
00:05:12.480,00:05:14.360,"So, what can we do, Nanny?"
00:05:14.360,00:05:20.320,"If the mommy were here, she would build a nest and sit on the egg to keep it warm."
00:05:21.560,00:05:23.080,"Please, can I sit on it?"
00:05:23.080,00:05:25.440,Your bottom is too small.
00:05:25.440,00:05:27.680,We need a bigger bottom.
00:05:32.160,00:05:33.840,"Hello, everybody."
00:05:33.840,00:05:35.520,"Hello, King Thistle."
00:05:37.880,00:05:39.320,Help you with what?
00:05:39.320,00:05:45.560,"Your Majesty, if you could sit on this egg until we build a nest, that would be most kind."
00:05:45.560,00:05:47.440,Very well.
00:05:49.320,00:05:51.440,Daddy looks a bit silly.
00:05:52.800,00:05:54.720,"I don't look silly, do I?"
00:05:54.720,00:05:56.320,"No, Daddy."
00:05:57.480,00:06:00.400,"I say, this is jolly uncomfortable."
00:06:01.960,00:06:03.960,We'll be as quick as we can.
00:06:03.960,00:06:06.560,We just need to build a nest.
00:06:11.880,00:06:13.720,Okay.
00:06:16.680,00:06:19.800,We'll collect these sticks.
00:06:22.200,00:06:24.240,We'll collect thistledown.
00:06:24.240,00:06:28.800,"Ooh, thistledown is very soft."
00:06:30.440,00:06:32.040,There.
00:06:32.040,00:06:35.560,"And now, the magic words."
00:06:35.560,00:06:47.480,"Sticks, moss And thistledown Make me a nest All cozy and round Lovely."
00:06:47.480,00:06:49.080,Can I get off now?
00:06:49.080,00:06:50.800,"Of course, Your Majesty."
00:06:52.040,00:06:53.560,"BEN: Look, there's a crack."
00:06:53.560,00:06:56.520,"Oh, Daddy, you've broken the egg."
00:06:57.720,00:07:01.000,No. The egg is cracking on its own.
00:07:03.560,00:07:04.880,The egg is hatching.
00:07:04.880,00:07:06.880,ALL: Ooh.
00:07:08.080,00:07:10.600,HOLLY: Oh. It's a little chick.
00:07:10.600,00:07:12.760,ALL: Aw!
00:07:12.760,00:07:13.960,Good.
00:07:13.960,00:07:17.880,"Now the mommy will hear the chick call, and come to collect it."
00:07:17.880,00:07:20.880,And I can get back to my work.
00:07:23.360,00:07:27.000,"HOLLY: Look, the chick is following Nanny Plum."
00:07:27.000,00:07:31.760,"WISE OLD ELF: Usually, the first thing a chick sees is its mommy."
00:07:31.760,00:07:34.520,BEN: And this chick saw Nanny first.
00:07:34.520,00:07:38.480,HOLLY: So it thinks Nanny is its mommy.
00:07:41.080,00:07:43.360,I am not a mommy bird.
00:07:44.600,00:07:45.960,The chick is hungry.
00:07:45.960,00:07:48.800,Mommy bird must give it food.
00:07:48.800,00:07:50.800,I haven't got any food.
00:07:50.800,00:07:52.840,What do birds eat?
00:07:52.840,00:07:55.120,Worms and insects.
00:07:55.120,00:07:58.160,"BEN: Uh, Gaston is an insect."
00:07:58.160,00:08:02.560,"Gaston, maybe you should stand back a bit."
00:08:07.600,00:08:08.960,How?
00:08:08.960,00:08:17.840,"With worm charming, like this: The worms think it is raining, and come up to breathe."
00:08:17.840,00:08:19.880,ALL: Ooh.
00:08:29.520,00:08:30.600,It got away.
00:08:30.600,00:08:31.800,ALL: Oh.
00:08:31.800,00:08:34.840,"Come on, everyone, try again."
00:08:41.640,00:08:44.480,HOLLY: There's another one.
00:08:44.480,00:08:45.760,ALL: Oh.
00:08:47.240,00:08:50.240,I give up.
00:08:52.320,00:08:55.480,The baby bird is very hungry.
00:08:58.280,00:09:02.120,"Usually, the mommy bird comes when her baby calls."
00:09:02.120,00:09:04.160,But it's not chirping loud enough.
00:09:05.840,00:09:09.440,"Nanny, do a spell to make the chick chirp louder."
00:09:11.320,00:09:18.760,"Zig zag zig Make it big BEN: Oh, no, Nanny!"
00:09:18.760,00:09:21.280,I think you've got the spell wrong.
00:09:21.280,00:09:23.680,The chick is getting bigger.
00:09:23.680,00:09:25.880,I haven't got the spell wrong.
00:09:30.440,00:09:31.760,ALL: Ooh.
00:09:31.760,00:09:34.960,"Don't worry, the spell won't last long."
00:09:34.960,00:09:37.040,"How long, Nanny Plum?"
00:09:37.040,00:09:40.480,Uh...
00:09:37.040,00:09:42.400,"It could last a minute, or a week, or..."
00:09:56.920,00:09:58.480,BEN: The spell is wearing off.
00:10:01.960,00:10:04.760,HOLLY: And the mommy bird is here.
00:10:05.600,00:10:07.960,ALL: Hooray!
00:10:09.840,00:10:11.560,What's it saying?
00:10:11.560,00:10:14.360,"The chick says, Thank you very much, and bye-bye."
00:10:14.360,00:10:16.360,ALL: Bye-bye.
00:10:21.600,00:10:24.280,"Nanny, I'm hungry."
00:10:24.280,00:10:25.480,Me too.
00:10:57.880,00:11:01.360,"Oh. Hi, Ben. Can I play too?"
00:11:01.360,00:11:03.920,"I'm not playing, I'm training."
00:11:03.920,00:11:06.600,It looks like playing to me.
00:11:06.600,00:11:07.920,"Well, it's not."
00:11:07.920,00:11:11.120,I'm getting ready for the Elf Games.
00:11:11.120,00:11:12.680,That sounds fun.
00:11:17.440,00:11:19.160,They're very serious.
00:11:24.240,00:11:26.920,This acorn's really heavy.
00:11:28.160,00:11:30.600,I can do that.
00:11:30.600,00:11:35.960,Abracadabra Easy-peasy. Heh.
00:11:37.840,00:11:41.760,We don't have magic at the Elf Games.
00:11:43.760,00:11:45.440,"So, what do you have?"
00:11:45.440,00:11:47.560,We have jumping.
00:11:47.560,00:11:49.520,Hoopla!
00:11:51.640,00:11:52.800,Hoopla!
00:11:54.040,00:11:56.080,We don't have flying either.
00:11:56.080,00:12:00.320,"The games are not for fairies, just for elves."
00:12:01.920,00:12:06.480,Fairies can do lots of things without flying or magic.
00:12:16.920,00:12:20.440,Dancing's not the only thing I can do.
00:12:20.440,00:12:21.680,Look.
00:12:21.680,00:12:24.800,I'm good at gymnastics.
00:12:25.840,00:12:30.400,And I'm really good at looking pretty.
00:12:30.400,00:12:35.800,"We don't have dancing, gymnastics or looking pretty at the Elf Games."
00:12:37.160,00:12:39.720,We're elves.
00:12:39.720,00:12:46.720,"We have serious things, like jumping, running and-- Princess Holly, time for your lessons."
00:12:46.720,00:12:48.480,"Oh, hello, Nanny Plum."
00:12:48.480,00:12:51.120,Ben's going to be in the Elf Games.
00:12:51.120,00:12:52.600,Can we go too?
00:12:52.600,00:12:55.320,"Won't it be boring for you, Princess Holly?"
00:12:55.320,00:12:58.240,Watching a lot of sweaty little elves running about?
00:12:58.240,00:13:02.440,We don't just run.
00:13:17.960,00:13:21.320,Yippee! I've won a trophy.
00:13:21.320,00:13:22.720,Hooray!
00:13:22.720,00:13:25.800,You can't just magic up a trophy.
00:13:25.800,00:13:27.440,You have to work for it.
00:13:27.440,00:13:30.040,I did work for it.
00:13:30.040,00:13:34.560,I didn't get this good at doing spells without lots of practice.
00:13:34.560,00:13:38.840,"Well, I've got to go and practice my running and jumping."
00:13:38.840,00:13:40.000,"Good luck, Ben."
00:13:40.000,00:13:41.360,"Bye, Holly."
00:13:41.360,00:13:43.000,See you later.
00:13:49.520,00:13:52.480,Welcome to the Elf Games.
00:14:04.680,00:14:06.720,"Carry on, Mr. Old Elf."
00:14:06.720,00:14:09.760,"Ah, good day, Mistress Plum."
00:14:09.760,00:14:11.280,"Hi, there."
00:14:11.280,00:14:23.160,"For the benefit of the, ahem, fairies amongst us, may I remind you there is to be strictly no magic and absolutely no flying."
00:14:23.160,00:14:28.880,"Dear me, I was right."
00:14:28.880,00:14:33.440,WISE OLD ELF: Now to our first event.
00:14:36.040,00:14:40.680,"WISE OLD ELF: On your marks, get set, go!"
00:14:46.480,00:14:48.840,"Ben! Come on, Ben!"
00:14:49.920,00:14:52.560,"Oh, Ben can't hear me."
00:14:52.560,00:14:54.640,We'll soon sort that out.
00:15:00.920,00:15:02.920,Ben! Ben!
00:15:05.480,00:15:08.240,"Go on, Ben! Run, Ben!"
00:15:10.000,00:15:12.960,I've got very sensitive ears.
00:15:12.960,00:15:15.920,"Sorry, Wise Old Elf!"
00:15:17.800,00:15:20.760,WISE OLD ELF: Barnaby Elf is the winner!
00:15:20.760,00:15:22.520,ALL: Hooray!
00:15:24.080,00:15:27.360,"HOLLY: Oh, no, Ben's come last."
00:15:27.360,00:15:30.760,"Oh, dear."
00:15:31.920,00:15:33.760,What did you do that for?
00:15:33.760,00:15:36.880,I was trying to help you win.
00:15:36.880,00:15:38.240,I was winning!
00:15:38.240,00:15:40.800,It was your shouting that made me lose.
00:15:40.800,00:15:42.200,"Sorry, Ben."
00:15:42.200,00:15:43.800,NANNY: Not to worry.
00:15:46.600,00:15:51.360,Will all competitors please get ready for the next event?
00:15:53.800,00:15:56.280,"You're very good at jumping, Ben."
00:15:56.280,00:15:58.120,You'll easily win.
00:15:58.120,00:16:00.800,I hope so.
00:16:00.800,00:16:02.240,I hope so too.
00:16:02.240,00:16:05.440,There's nothing worse than a grumpy elf.
00:16:05.440,00:16:09.240,WISE OLD ELF: The first competitor is Lizzy Elf.
00:16:13.680,00:16:15.880,ALL: Hooray!
00:16:15.880,00:16:23.320,"WISE OLD ELF: Now, for last year's high jump champion, Ben Elf."
00:16:23.320,00:16:24.760,"Good luck, Ben."
00:16:24.760,00:16:27.200,Yes! You can do it!
00:16:30.080,00:16:32.120,ALL: Hooray!
00:16:32.120,00:16:34.720,Phew! I didn't think he was going to do it.
00:16:34.720,00:16:36.960,Another excellent jump.
00:16:36.960,00:16:43.240,"Now, for our final competitor, Barnaby Elf."
00:16:47.840,00:16:52.400,We're down to the last two for the high jump trophy.
00:16:52.400,00:16:55.400,I hope Ben doesn't knock the pole off.
00:17:00.360,00:17:02.240,"Oh, dear."
00:17:06.400,00:17:08.800,"ELF: Come on, Lizzy, jump high!"
00:17:10.360,00:17:12.320,ALL: Hooray!
00:17:15.920,00:17:20.280,"If he loses, he's going to be really upset."
00:17:20.280,00:17:22.120,Don't worry.
00:17:22.120,00:17:25.280,We'll give him a little bit of magical help.
00:17:25.280,00:17:28.760,"But, Nanny, magic isn't allowed."
00:17:28.760,00:17:32.360,Relax. No one will notice.
00:17:32.360,00:17:35.800,"Are you sure no one will notice, Nanny?"
00:17:35.800,00:17:37.480,Trust me.
00:17:38.800,00:17:40.360,Whoa!
00:17:41.560,00:17:42.840,Whoa!
00:17:49.280,00:17:53.640,You see?
00:17:53.640,00:17:57.080,Someone has been using magic.
00:17:57.080,00:17:58.440,He knows.
00:17:58.440,00:18:01.800,"Okay, but he doesn't know it was me."
00:18:06.040,00:18:10.520,"I'll take that wand, if you please."
00:18:14.560,00:18:16.640,But that's not fair.
00:18:16.640,00:18:23.360,"The rule book clearly says, Magic is not allowed at the Elf Games."
00:18:23.360,00:18:25.760,But it wasn't Ben's fault.
00:18:25.760,00:18:27.760,It was my idea.
00:18:29.160,00:18:31.600,We were worried you wouldn't win.
00:18:31.600,00:18:35.280,I could've won the race and the high jump.
00:18:37.440,00:18:43.640,"WISE OLD ELF: Take your partners, please, for our final event: The wheelbarrow race."
00:18:45.400,00:18:49.040,"WISE OLD ELF: Oh, dear, Ben doesn't have a partner."
00:18:49.040,00:18:52.240,"Can I be your partner, Ben?"
00:18:52.240,00:18:55.640,I promise I won't use magic or flying.
00:18:55.640,00:18:59.080,No! You've already messed things up enough!
00:18:59.080,00:19:03.160,"Please, Ben."
00:19:03.160,00:19:05.000,What is a wheelbarrow race?
00:19:06.240,00:19:08.400,This is how you do it.
00:19:09.680,00:19:12.040,I'm really good at walking on my hands.
00:19:12.040,00:19:15.160,It's just like gymnastics.
00:19:15.160,00:19:17.000,"Okay, then."
00:19:21.280,00:19:27.040,"Oh, well, the rule book doesn't say a fairy can't race."
00:19:27.040,00:19:32.200,"On your marks, get set, go!"
00:19:40.880,00:19:42.400,BOTH: We won!
00:19:42.400,00:19:43.680,ALL: Hooray!
00:19:43.680,00:19:45.200,Goodness me.
00:19:45.200,00:19:50.520,The winners are Ben Elf and Fairy Princess Holly.
00:19:50.520,00:19:51.800,ALL: Hooray!
00:19:51.800,00:19:53.040,"Thanks, Holly."
00:19:53.040,00:19:55.280,"No problem, Ben."
00:19:59.560,00:20:01.520,And I can do this.
00:20:05.400,00:20:07.440,ALL: Ooh!
00:20:07.440,00:20:08.880,Gracious me.
00:20:08.880,00:20:10.400,What was that?
00:20:10.400,00:20:16.760,"Dancing, gymnastics and looking pretty."
00:20:16.760,00:20:18.040,WISE OLD ELF: Very good.
00:20:18.040,00:20:24.440,At the next Elf Games we shall have dancing and gymnastics.
00:20:24.440,00:20:26.160,And looking pretty?
00:20:26.160,00:20:28.760,"Yes, and looking pretty."
00:20:28.760,00:20:30.680,ALL: Hooray!
00:20:30.680,00:20:34.160,Maybe Princess Holly can teach us how to do it.
00:20:35.360,00:20:36.600,"Yes, please."
00:00:35.720,00:00:43.720,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:00:49.680,00:00:51.280,Happy birthday.
00:00:55.920,00:00:57.360,I don't want a birthday.
00:00:57.360,00:00:59.360,You don't want a birthday?
00:00:59.360,00:01:01.840,No.
00:01:01.840,00:01:03.480,I don't like my birthday.
00:01:03.480,00:01:08.280,"Every year, we make a big song and dance about the fact that I'm getting older."
00:01:08.280,00:01:11.040,But we always celebrate your birthday.
00:01:11.040,00:01:15.280,"The elves hold a big party with music, dancing and fireworks."
00:01:15.280,00:01:16.840,It's so much fun.
00:01:18.440,00:01:20.920,"Well, today is going to be different."
00:01:20.920,00:01:22.800,No birthday party.
00:01:24.480,00:01:27.240,"Happy birthday, Your Majesty."
00:01:27.240,00:01:28.520,Here's your cake.
00:01:29.720,00:01:31.440,Sorry there aren't enough candles.
00:01:31.440,00:01:36.600,"There should be one for every year, but we'd need-- Stop going on about how old I am!"
00:01:36.600,00:01:40.960,"But, darling, you're only-- And no cake! Take it away."
00:01:42.400,00:01:45.160,I've baked loads of cakes for the party.
00:01:45.160,00:01:46.840,I don't care.
00:01:51.000,00:01:54.600,Oh. I suppose I'll just have to eat all the cakes myself.
00:01:54.600,00:01:57.760,Why doesn't Daddy want a birthday?
00:01:57.760,00:01:59.960,He doesn't like getting older.
00:01:59.960,00:02:01.200,Who does?
00:02:01.200,00:02:02.840,I do.
00:02:08.760,00:02:12.280,I can't wait for the King's birthday party.
00:02:12.280,00:02:13.680,Me too.
00:02:13.680,00:02:16.520,We've got a really big firework to let off.
00:02:16.520,00:02:18.880,"Yes, it's as big as a carrot."
00:02:20.240,00:02:23.480,"And there'll be music, dancing and cakes."
00:02:23.480,00:02:26.800,Everyone loves King Thistle's birthday party.
00:02:29.040,00:02:32.720,Firework delivery for King Thistle's birthday party.
00:02:32.720,00:02:34.120,"Oh, Ben."
00:02:36.640,00:02:38.400,BOTH: No party?
00:02:41.640,00:02:43.800,Who does?
00:02:43.800,00:02:47.160,So there won't be any fireworks now.
00:02:47.160,00:02:48.640,Or music.
00:02:48.640,00:02:51.200,Or dancing.
00:02:54.080,00:02:56.720,Can I stay here with Holly?
00:02:56.720,00:02:59.680,"Bye, Dad."
00:03:06.360,00:03:07.680,"Good idea, Ben."
00:03:07.680,00:03:10.120,I could do a magic spell to cheer the King up.
00:03:10.120,00:03:13.400,Really? Will that work?
00:03:27.640,00:03:29.320,Easy-peasy.
00:03:39.040,00:03:40.680,"Oh, dear."
00:03:40.680,00:03:42.400,Mommy can't stop laughing.
00:03:43.600,00:03:45.400,Please.
00:03:47.840,00:03:50.480,Oh. That was horrible.
00:03:50.480,00:03:52.520,I'm not sure about that.
00:03:57.000,00:04:00.200,Maybe we won't use magic to cheer the King up.
00:04:00.200,00:04:02.880,Perhaps we could cheer King Thistle up another way.
00:04:02.880,00:04:07.280,My dad always likes talking about when he was a boy.
00:04:08.640,00:04:13.640,"So if we ask your dad about when he was young, that might cheer him up."
00:04:13.640,00:04:15.520,"Good idea, Ben."
00:04:16.920,00:04:18.520,"Hello, Daddy."
00:04:18.520,00:04:21.400,"Hello, Holly."
00:04:21.400,00:04:23.840,Dad?
00:04:23.840,00:04:26.080,What was it like when you were a boy?
00:04:26.080,00:04:28.320,Why would you want to know that?
00:04:28.320,00:04:29.560,We're interested.
00:04:29.560,00:04:30.960,Yes.
00:04:30.960,00:04:34.280,"I can't remember, it was a long time ago."
00:04:34.280,00:04:36.960,You must remember something.
00:04:39.080,00:04:43.600,Yes. When I was a boy-- Were there dinosaurs?
00:04:43.600,00:04:44.720,Yes.
00:04:44.720,00:04:47.840,"Dinosaurs with big, pointy teeth."
00:04:47.840,00:04:50.600,No.
00:04:50.600,00:04:53.680,What was it like before the telephone was invented?
00:04:53.680,00:04:56.120,"Did you live in a cave, Daddy?"
00:04:57.760,00:05:01.440,"And that's quite enough questions about when I was young, thank you."
00:05:01.440,00:05:03.280,But we're interested.
00:05:03.280,00:05:04.480,"Well, I'm not."
00:05:07.840,00:05:10.400,All right.
00:05:14.600,00:05:15.760,Yes.
00:05:23.200,00:05:25.840,Yes. He's very wise.
00:05:25.840,00:05:27.240,And he's old.
00:05:27.240,00:05:29.080,He'll know what to do.
00:05:31.000,00:05:33.360,"Hello, Holly. Hello, Ben."
00:05:33.360,00:05:35.200,"BOTH: Hello, Wise Old Elf."
00:05:35.200,00:05:36.600,Have you heard?
00:05:39.600,00:05:40.920,"Ah, yes."
00:05:40.920,00:05:43.960,After all our hard work arranging everything.
00:05:43.960,00:05:48.240,And the Elf Band had composed a special song too.
00:05:48.240,00:05:49.280,Listen.
00:05:49.280,00:06:08.320,ALL: That's very nice.
00:06:08.320,00:06:12.640,But Daddy doesn't want to have his birthday because he thinks he's too old.
00:06:12.640,00:06:15.080,King Thistle's not old.
00:06:15.080,00:06:17.800,I've got T-shirts older than him.
00:06:17.800,00:06:19.160,Really?
00:06:19.160,00:06:22.440,I'm sure the King just needs cheering up.
00:06:22.440,00:06:24.000,We've tried that.
00:06:24.000,00:06:25.640,It didn't work.
00:06:25.640,00:06:29.120,So I suppose there won't be a party after all.
00:06:29.120,00:06:30.560,No music.
00:06:32.040,00:06:33.800,No fireworks.
00:06:33.800,00:06:35.200,Hm.
00:06:35.200,00:06:38.320,"The King likes surprises, doesn't he?"
00:06:38.320,00:06:39.760,Yes.
00:06:39.760,00:06:43.240,We could give the King a surprise party.
00:06:46.040,00:06:49.840,"Ah, but it won't be a birthday party."
00:06:49.840,00:06:57.240,"There'll be music and dancing and fireworks, and no one will say the word birthday."
00:06:57.240,00:06:59.560,"Gosh, that's very clever."
00:06:59.560,00:07:01.160,It's brilliant.
00:07:01.160,00:07:02.280,"Come on, Ben."
00:07:02.280,00:07:05.000,We need to get ready for the party.
00:07:06.440,00:07:08.640,Calling all elves.
00:07:08.640,00:07:11.880,We need to arrange the King's party.
00:07:11.880,00:07:13.160,ALL: Right-o!
00:07:15.240,00:07:16.840,"Hello, Daddy."
00:07:16.840,00:07:20.760,I've got something for you.
00:07:20.760,00:07:21.880,Open it and see.
00:07:26.000,00:07:28.800,It's not a birthday card.
00:07:28.800,00:07:34.080,This is just a card to say what a lovely daddy you are.
00:07:34.080,00:07:36.440,"Oh, thank you, Holly."
00:07:36.440,00:07:38.200,And here's a present.
00:07:38.200,00:07:41.440,"It's not a birthday present, is it?"
00:07:41.440,00:07:43.000,"No, King Thistle."
00:07:45.440,00:07:48.000,A toy robot!
00:07:48.000,00:07:49.160,"Thank you, Ben."
00:07:49.160,00:07:50.560,I made it myself.
00:07:53.360,00:07:55.040,And here's your cake.
00:07:57.960,00:07:59.640,Absolutely not.
00:07:59.640,00:08:02.360,This is just an ordinary cake.
00:08:02.360,00:08:04.360,The taste is completely different.
00:08:06.960,00:08:09.280,Delicious.
00:08:09.280,00:08:13.200,"Mm. Cards, presents, cake."
00:08:13.200,00:08:16.400,And this is nothing to do with my birthday?
00:08:16.400,00:08:18.000,ALL: No.
00:08:18.000,00:08:21.120,"Well, I suppose it's not really a birthday then."
00:08:21.120,00:08:23.720,As long as the Elf Band doesn't turn up.
00:08:28.240,00:08:31.400,"There's one more surprise, Daddy."
00:08:31.400,00:08:34.200,"Oh, I love surprises."
00:08:36.040,00:08:38.200,Okay.
00:08:40.000,00:08:42.000,You can open your eyes...
00:08:47.240,00:08:50.440,"I said, no birthday party!"
00:08:50.440,00:08:53.120,"It's not a birthday party, darling."
00:08:53.120,00:08:55.720,It's just a surprise party.
00:08:55.720,00:08:58.680,"Oh, well, then I suppose..."
00:08:58.680,00:09:07.800,"Happy birth-- I mean, congratulations, Your Majesty, on being such an excellent king."
00:09:07.800,00:09:09.600,Well done!
00:09:09.600,00:09:11.520,Oh. Thank you.
00:09:11.520,00:09:15.840,"And now, for the giant firework!"
00:09:15.840,00:09:17.880,It's as big as a carrot.
00:09:25.520,00:09:28.600,"Ha, ha! I love fireworks."
00:09:28.600,00:09:37.120,"And now, Your Majesty, the Elf Band will sing a special song in your honor."
00:09:37.120,00:10:00.160,"ALL: Uh, of course, the song isn't actually about you."
00:10:00.160,00:10:01.720,"ALL: Oh, no, no, no."
00:10:01.720,00:10:05.440,"It's about a different king, Your Majesty."
00:10:05.440,00:10:07.480,A king far away from here.
00:10:07.480,00:10:09.960,Who's birthday it is today.
00:10:19.440,00:10:22.480,"Come on, Daddy, let's dance."
00:10:22.480,00:10:24.560,"Ho, ho!"
00:10:27.720,00:10:30.400,This is fun!
00:10:30.400,00:10:32.840,"Happy birthday, Daddy."
00:10:32.840,00:10:36.240,"Ho, ho. Thank you, Holly."
00:10:39.200,00:10:47.200,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:10:52.640,00:10:56.600,"Oh, Strawberry, isn't it a lovely morning?"
00:10:56.600,00:10:59.160,"Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:10:59.160,00:11:00.400,"Hi, Strawberry."
00:11:00.400,00:11:03.520,Have you come to join us for wand practice?
00:11:03.520,00:11:07.040,No. I came to see if Holly wanted to play.
00:11:07.040,00:11:10.280,But now you can join us for wand practice.
00:11:10.280,00:11:13.960,"Uh, but-- I don't know where my wand is."
00:11:15.680,00:11:17.800,"Oh, yes, so I am."
00:11:19.080,00:11:21.720,You know how much fun wand practice is.
00:11:24.000,00:11:25.760,Right.
00:11:31.000,00:11:32.960,Up and down.
00:11:35.480,00:11:37.200,Up and down.
00:11:37.200,00:11:39.720,Very good.
00:11:39.720,00:11:41.960,Up and down.
00:11:41.960,00:11:43.880,Up and down.
00:11:45.040,00:11:46.960,"Hi, Holly."
00:11:46.960,00:11:48.800,Do you want to play football?
00:11:48.800,00:11:50.480,We can't.
00:11:50.480,00:11:53.440,We have to do wand practice.
00:11:55.520,00:11:57.800,Up and down.
00:11:57.800,00:12:00.440,Aren't you supposed to be gentle with your wands?
00:12:00.440,00:12:03.920,"It's okay, wands are very strong."
00:12:06.240,00:12:07.920,Don't be silly.
00:12:10.120,00:12:14.240,"Show him, Holly, hit your wand on that rock."
00:12:14.240,00:12:16.400,Okay.
00:12:18.560,00:12:20.920,"Oh, dear."
00:12:20.920,00:12:24.960,Holly! Strawberry!
00:12:24.960,00:12:27.920,"Uh, not very well."
00:12:27.920,00:12:30.160,Holly's broken her wand.
00:12:31.440,00:12:37.240,"I was waving it very gently, and-- She bashed it on a rock."
00:12:37.240,00:12:38.840,That wasn't very clever.
00:12:40.240,00:12:41.440,Not to worry.
00:12:41.440,00:12:43.040,We'll just get it mended.
00:12:43.040,00:12:44.280,Hooray!
00:12:49.840,00:12:51.080,Why not?
00:12:51.080,00:12:54.640,"Wands make magic, but magic can't make wands."
00:12:54.640,00:12:56.240,It's like chickens and eggs.
00:12:56.240,00:12:58.920,"Chickens make eggs, but eggs don't make chickens."
00:13:02.920,00:13:05.440,Whatever.
00:13:02.920,00:13:07.800,"The important thing is, I can't mend wands by magic."
00:13:07.800,00:13:10.480,So who can mend it?
00:13:12.080,00:13:13.480,BOTH: Elves?
00:13:13.480,00:13:16.000,Do elves make wands?
00:13:19.280,00:13:22.160,Elves are very good at making wands.
00:13:22.160,00:13:24.360,BOTH: And we're elves.
00:13:30.440,00:13:35.600,"HOLLY: But, Nanny, wands are magic, and elves don't do magic."
00:13:35.600,00:13:39.560,"Elves don't use the wands, Holly, they just make them."
00:13:40.600,00:13:42.880,Good morning.
00:13:42.880,00:13:46.240,"Um, I've broken my wand."
00:13:46.240,00:13:49.040,She bashed it on a rock.
00:13:49.040,00:13:51.480,"One moment, please."
00:13:51.480,00:13:52.800,Wise Old Elf.
00:13:52.800,00:13:58.640,"Wise Old Elf, please report to reception immediately."
00:13:58.640,00:14:01.200,"Ah, Princess Holly."
00:14:01.200,00:14:03.280,What can I do for you?
00:14:03.280,00:14:05.200,Holly's broken her wand.
00:14:08.920,00:14:12.040,Not to worry.
00:14:12.040,00:14:13.240,Follow me.
00:14:22.560,00:14:24.200,ALL: Ooh!
00:14:26.720,00:14:29.680,"Hold tight, everyone."
00:14:29.680,00:14:32.480,We're going deep down.
00:14:32.480,00:14:34.840,How deep down?
00:14:34.840,00:14:37.080,Level 500.
00:14:37.080,00:14:39.960,The wand factory.
00:14:42.960,00:14:45.280,Level 500?
00:14:45.280,00:14:47.840,It's the deepest level there is.
00:14:52.400,00:14:54.840,Because wands are magic.
00:14:54.840,00:14:57.360,And elves don't like magic.
00:14:57.360,00:15:02.800,So we built the wand factory as deep underground as possible.
00:15:02.800,00:15:04.000,ALL: Whee!
00:15:04.000,00:15:06.600,NANNY: Aah!
00:15:07.880,00:15:10.280,"Oh, my tummy."
00:15:10.280,00:15:14.040,"Now, what's wrong with your wand?"
00:15:16.080,00:15:18.120,She bashed it on a rock.
00:15:18.120,00:15:19.320,"Yes, yes."
00:15:19.320,00:15:24.840,But we need to find out exactly what's wrong with your wand.
00:15:26.320,00:15:28.720,ALL: Ooh!
00:15:28.720,00:15:35.080,WISE OLD ELF: The x-ray shows it needs a new stick and a cog service.
00:15:37.400,00:15:39.360,This way.
00:15:39.360,00:15:45.120,"This is the stick house, where we grow wooden sticks for wands."
00:15:45.120,00:15:48.680,But there are loads of sticks just lying around in the meadow.
00:15:48.680,00:15:53.760,"Ah, but the stick for a wand must be specially grown."
00:15:53.760,00:15:57.240,And made from the right type of tree.
00:15:57.240,00:15:59.880,"Correct, Nanny Plum."
00:15:59.880,00:16:06.040,The wood for my wand comes from a plum tree because I am Nanny Plum.
00:16:10.120,00:16:11.480,Holly tree.
00:16:11.480,00:16:14.400,Exactly.
00:16:14.400,00:16:19.000,"So, Strawberry, what tree does your wand come from?"
00:16:19.000,00:16:23.040,"Um, it must come from a strawberry tree."
00:16:23.040,00:16:24.840,Oh.
00:16:26.440,00:16:29.080,Let's see how that feels.
00:16:30.280,00:16:32.600,Hm. It's a bit big.
00:16:32.600,00:16:35.040,It just needs a little trim.
00:16:41.680,00:16:43.880,Is my wand mended now?
00:16:43.880,00:16:45.920,"Not yet, Princess Holly."
00:16:45.920,00:16:48.360,We need to mend the head.
00:16:48.360,00:16:50.600,Follow me.
00:16:58.040,00:16:59.440,ALL: Ooh!
00:16:59.440,00:17:03.080,"Spinnyicklepoo clamp, please."
00:17:08.040,00:17:10.680,It all looks very complicated.
00:17:10.680,00:17:16.720,Mending a wand head is a mixture of surgery and watch making.
00:17:16.720,00:17:18.120,ALL: Aah!
00:17:18.120,00:17:21.880,The Fidge-Fudge-Rotter-Whistle stick.
00:17:21.880,00:17:23.120,Whistle stick.
00:17:33.680,00:17:36.120,That doesn't sound right.
00:17:39.280,00:17:41.720,ALL: Hooray!
00:17:41.720,00:17:43.880,"WISE OLD ELF: Not yet, Nanny Plum."
00:17:43.880,00:17:47.120,Holly's wand needs testing.
00:17:47.120,00:17:50.200,To the testing room.
00:17:50.200,00:17:53.520,The wand testing room.
00:17:53.520,00:17:57.920,It is the safest place to do magic in the kingdom.
00:17:57.920,00:18:01.000,Why do you need a special room to do magic?
00:18:01.000,00:18:04.760,We don't want the magic leaking out and causing trouble.
00:18:04.760,00:18:06.080,Where's the fun in that?
00:18:06.080,00:18:09.240,Magic is not meant to be fun.
00:18:09.240,00:18:13.800,Safe and sensible magic is what we do here.
00:18:13.800,00:18:15.080,What's he doing?
00:18:15.080,00:18:21.360,He's setting up the testing robot to do a magic spell.
00:18:21.360,00:18:22.800,HOLLY: What's that?
00:18:24.080,00:18:30.400,"We're going to test the wand, by turning the lemonade into something else."
00:18:33.400,00:18:37.280,Or a monster with a hundred eyes and three legs?
00:18:51.560,00:18:56.000,WISE OLD ELF: The lemonade has turned into water.
00:18:57.560,00:19:00.040,Why would you want to do that?
00:19:00.040,00:19:01.720,That's not magic.
00:19:01.720,00:19:04.240,It's very sensible magic.
00:19:04.240,00:19:06.280,It's rubbish magic.
00:19:06.280,00:19:08.760,"Well, what would you turn it into?"
00:19:08.760,00:19:10.880,How about this?
00:19:12.960,00:19:17.520,You did magic outside the test room.
00:19:17.520,00:19:19.520,Oh. It's a lemon.
00:19:21.320,00:19:23.640,Nanny Plum.
00:19:23.640,00:19:25.800,My wand's not working right.
00:19:25.800,00:19:27.640,It's rattling.
00:19:27.640,00:19:30.800,"Oh, I see what you mean."
00:19:30.800,00:19:32.560,That doesn't sound right.
00:19:32.560,00:19:33.920,Hm.
00:19:33.920,00:19:36.880,When did you last have this wand serviced?
00:19:36.880,00:19:39.080,Ten years ago.
00:19:40.240,00:19:43.440,Wands should be serviced once a year.
00:19:45.040,00:19:47.960,"Here, try that."
00:19:49.880,00:19:52.040,"Yes, that's much better."
00:19:52.040,00:19:53.320,Nanny.
00:19:53.320,00:19:56.000,You turned the Wise Old Elf into a frog.
00:19:58.480,00:20:00.960,Are you going to turn him back again?
00:20:02.280,00:20:03.760,I suppose I'll have to.
00:20:03.760,00:20:08.520,Silly Old Elf Back to yourself Very good.
00:20:08.520,00:20:12.400,Your wand seems to be working perfectly.
00:20:12.400,00:20:16.160,Don't wait 10 years before getting it serviced again.
00:20:18.080,00:20:19.640,Sorry.
00:20:19.640,00:20:22.840,"Thank you for mending my wand, Wise Old Elf."
00:20:22.840,00:20:25.400,"You're welcome, Princess Holly."
00:20:28.760,00:20:33.320,I promise to take special care of you from now on.
00:20:33.320,00:20:34.680,STRAWBERRY: Yes.
00:20:34.680,00:20:36.520,Don't bash it on a rock.
00:20:36.520,00:20:37.720,I won't.
00:00:29.880,00:00:33.880,NARRATOR: Ben &amp; Holly's Little Kingdom.
00:00:36.200,00:00:42.240,Today's adventure starts at the great elf tree.
00:00:43.640,00:00:47.320,"HOLLY: Morning, Noon and Night."
00:00:59.560,00:01:01.760,7:00. Time to get up.
00:01:01.760,00:01:04.720,Ben!
00:01:04.720,00:01:06.040,"Thanks, Dad."
00:01:07.720,00:01:10.600,"Right then, let's get your hair brushed."
00:01:10.600,00:01:12.600,Let's get your elf hat on.
00:01:12.600,00:01:14.960,MRS. ELF: Don't forget your new watch.
00:01:14.960,00:01:17.640,"There, now you're ready for school."
00:01:17.640,00:01:21.440,"But, Mom, Elf School doesn't start for ages."
00:01:21.440,00:01:23.080,Can I go and see Holly?
00:01:25.600,00:01:29.680,"MRS. ELF: Okay, but make sure you get to school on time."
00:01:29.680,00:01:31.040,Of course I will.
00:01:31.040,00:01:34.840,"Elves are never late, and I'm an elf."
00:01:37.280,00:01:41.880,"Phew, Mr. Elf."
00:01:41.880,00:01:44.000,I should say so.
00:01:53.680,00:01:57.160,"That's the cockerel crow, Princess Holly."
00:01:57.160,00:01:59.640,Time for fairies to get up.
00:02:01.320,00:02:03.880,Is it morning already?
00:02:11.480,00:02:14.240,"Thank you, Nanny Plum."
00:02:26.200,00:02:28.920,And here's your crown.
00:02:30.560,00:02:31.840,QUEEN: All done.
00:02:41.760,00:02:44.040,"What is it, Ben?"
00:02:41.760,00:02:45.760,I haven't got time to be answering the door to elves.
00:02:45.760,00:02:47.520,Can Holly come out to play?
00:02:47.520,00:02:51.680,"I'm afraid Princess Holly is too busy to-- Hi, Ben."
00:02:51.680,00:02:54.640,"Hi, Holly."
00:02:54.640,00:02:58.360,HOLLY: Wow. Is it a real watch?
00:02:58.360,00:03:01.280,BEN: Yes. You can hear it ticking.
00:03:02.920,00:03:06.200,"Oh, yes."
00:03:06.200,00:03:10.720,"Not yet, but we're going to learn how to tell the time at school today."
00:03:10.720,00:03:13.440,"Yes. Well, I'm sure you don't want to be late."
00:03:17.680,00:03:18.920,"Bye, Holly."
00:03:20.640,00:03:23.280,I wish I had a watch.
00:03:23.280,00:03:25.560,"Whatever for, Princess Holly?"
00:03:25.560,00:03:29.720,If I had a watch I could tell the time.
00:03:29.720,00:03:32.360,We fairies don't need watches.
00:03:35.040,00:03:36.800,"Like what, Nanny?"
00:03:36.800,00:03:39.200,We have dandelion clocks.
00:03:40.680,00:03:42.000,Here's a good one.
00:03:45.840,00:03:50.440,We count how many puffs it takes to blow away all the seeds.
00:03:50.440,00:03:52.880,Like this.
00:03:52.880,00:03:55.440,One...
00:03:55.440,00:03:57.480,Two...
00:03:57.480,00:03:59.160,Three.
00:03:59.160,00:04:03.080,"It took three puffs, that means 3:00."
00:04:08.920,00:04:10.280,One.
00:04:12.240,00:04:15.800,Wow. So is it really 1:00?
00:04:15.800,00:04:19.240,"Ha, ha. Not really."
00:04:19.240,00:04:22.760,But Ben's learning to tell the time properly.
00:04:22.760,00:04:25.160,Can I go to his lesson?
00:04:26.320,00:04:27.560,All right.
00:04:40.280,00:04:42.880,"Hello, Wise Old Elf."
00:04:46.960,00:04:49.200,Can we join you?
00:04:49.200,00:04:53.040,Yes.
00:04:53.040,00:04:54.720,Righty-o.
00:04:54.720,00:05:02.320,"Hm. Now, who can tell me how we know a watch is working?"
00:05:05.120,00:05:08.960,"Oh. Yes, Holly, very good."
00:05:12.360,00:05:16.480,But you fairies don't have watches or clocks.
00:05:16.480,00:05:19.360,We have our own ways of telling the time.
00:05:21.480,00:05:26.800,"Now, how do we know when to wake up in the morning?"
00:05:28.680,00:05:30.240,Correct.
00:05:30.240,00:05:33.160,I wake up when the cockerel crows.
00:05:33.160,00:05:35.880,Cock-a-doodle-doo!
00:05:35.880,00:05:37.080,"Yes, I see."
00:05:37.080,00:05:41.400,And how do we know when it's time to go to sleep?
00:05:41.400,00:05:44.520,When the clock says it's bedtime.
00:05:44.520,00:05:47.480,Yes. Correct again.
00:05:47.480,00:05:50.920,I go to sleep when the owl hoots.
00:05:50.920,00:05:52.560,Twit-a-woo!
00:05:54.320,00:05:58.920,But without clocks how do you know what time it is?
00:05:58.920,00:06:02.040,We have dandelion clocks.
00:06:03.360,00:06:04.560,One...
00:06:04.560,00:06:06.640,"Hee, hee."
00:06:08.440,00:06:09.760,Two...
00:06:09.760,00:06:12.000,And me.
00:06:12.000,00:06:14.440,Three.
00:06:14.440,00:06:17.160,That means 3:00.
00:06:22.000,00:06:24.440,That's all fairy nonsense.
00:06:24.440,00:06:26.600,"Ha, ha. But it's fun."
00:06:30.480,00:06:35.480,I don't suppose you fairies can tell me what time it is now?
00:06:35.480,00:06:37.040,It's noon.
00:06:42.600,00:06:46.200,Because the sun is high up in the sky.
00:06:47.600,00:06:52.760,And I know it's lunchtime because my tummy is rumbling.
00:06:55.200,00:07:00.520,Excuse me.
00:07:05.280,00:07:07.800,School is finished for today.
00:07:09.000,00:07:13.320,"Holly, would you like to come over to play this afternoon?"
00:07:13.320,00:07:16.280,"Okay. See you later, alligator."
00:07:16.280,00:07:18.560,"In a while, crocodile."
00:07:22.960,00:07:28.400,"Hm, it's almost 6:00."
00:07:28.400,00:07:29.600,"Hi, Ben."
00:07:29.600,00:07:31.000,You're late.
00:07:31.000,00:07:34.160,Fairies are always late.
00:07:34.160,00:07:37.400,And I'm a fairy.
00:07:39.560,00:07:42.760,Hurry up.
00:07:47.280,00:07:49.320,What's that noise?
00:07:49.320,00:07:50.880,You'll see.
00:07:53.960,00:07:56.320,Are we there yet?
00:07:56.320,00:07:58.200,Nearly.
00:08:02.080,00:08:03.800,"Hello, Princess Holly."
00:08:03.800,00:08:05.760,"Hello, Wise Old Elf."
00:08:05.760,00:08:09.040,This is the Great Elf Clock.
00:08:09.040,00:08:10.200,Wow.
00:08:10.200,00:08:13.160,The most accurate clock of all.
00:08:15.800,00:08:19.600,It means it always tells the right time.
00:08:21.440,00:08:25.920,I set it every night by the distant bells.
00:08:38.320,00:08:41.400,Oh. My tummy's rumbling.
00:08:41.400,00:08:44.280,That means it's time for dinner.
00:08:45.520,00:08:48.240,Dinner time!
00:08:56.320,00:09:00.880,The bells! The bells!
00:09:00.880,00:09:05.120,Now I need to adjust the clock.
00:09:07.800,00:09:09.760,What do you mean?
00:09:09.760,00:09:14.320,"Nanny rings the bell every night, when it's dinner time."
00:09:15.760,00:09:19.640,And how does Nanny Plum know it's dinner time?
00:09:21.880,00:09:23.440,What?
00:09:23.440,00:09:29.840,You mean I've been setting the Great Elf Clock to a fairy's tummy rumble?
00:09:29.840,00:09:31.720,HOLLY: Yes. Hee-hee-hee.
00:09:36.280,00:09:42.360,Ho-ho-ho. Her tummy does seem to be amazingly accurate.
00:09:42.360,00:09:44.320,It is dinner time.
00:09:45.920,00:09:47.080,"Bye, Ben."
00:09:51.800,00:09:56.240,And the beautiful princess lived happily ever after.
00:09:56.240,00:09:58.320,The end.
00:09:58.320,00:09:59.760,"Time to sleep, Holly."
00:09:59.760,00:10:03.400,"But, Daddy, the owl hasn't hooted yet."
00:10:10.040,00:10:13.280,And the fierce dragon ate the witch.
00:10:13.280,00:10:17.480,And everyone lived happily ever after.
00:10:17.480,00:10:19.600,The end.
00:10:19.600,00:10:21.000,"Time to sleep, Ben."
00:10:21.000,00:10:24.520,"But, Mom, the clock hasn't chimed yet."
00:10:30.400,00:10:31.840,"Good night, Holly."
00:10:38.560,00:10:44.240,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at Gaston's cave.
00:10:45.720,00:10:48.120,HOLLY: Gaston's Visit.
00:10:50.200,00:10:51.800,Gaston!
00:10:51.800,00:10:55.040,Are you coming out to play?
00:10:58.880,00:11:00.160,"Mommy, Daddy."
00:11:00.160,00:11:03.280,Gaston the Ladybird's caught a cold.
00:11:03.280,00:11:05.880,I'm not surprised.
00:11:07.200,00:11:09.360,Look.
00:11:13.440,00:11:15.840,Maybe if we move that pebble over it...
00:11:15.840,00:11:17.600,WISE OLD ELF: Good day.
00:11:17.600,00:11:19.200,"Good day, Wise Old Elf."
00:11:19.200,00:11:22.000,"Uh, what seems to be the problem?"
00:11:22.000,00:11:24.560,Gaston's cave is leaking.
00:11:24.560,00:11:28.360,Hm. Leaks can be tricky.
00:11:28.360,00:11:32.360,What you need is a proper builder to fix it.
00:11:32.360,00:11:35.000,But where can we find a builder?
00:11:36.920,00:11:38.200,Really?
00:11:39.400,00:11:44.840,"Elves are very good at building, and I'm an elf."
00:11:47.080,00:11:51.480,"In that case, I command you to fix Gaston's cave."
00:11:51.480,00:11:55.800,"Yes, Your Majesty, a wise decision."
00:12:00.320,00:12:03.560,There seems to be water dripping in.
00:12:05.720,00:12:07.040,Ho-ho-ho.
00:12:07.040,00:12:10.280,That hole won't be the cause of the leak.
00:12:10.280,00:12:12.920,How do you know?
00:12:10.280,00:12:17.680,"With respect, some things are best left to proper builders."
00:12:17.680,00:12:20.040,So how long will it take to fix the leak?
00:12:20.040,00:12:25.520,"Oh, it will take a very, very long time."
00:12:33.400,00:12:35.720,BEN: But Gaston's got a cold.
00:12:35.720,00:12:37.520,Where can he stay?
00:12:37.520,00:12:40.280,"Well, perhaps Gaston could stay with us."
00:12:40.280,00:12:41.800,Yippee.
00:12:41.800,00:12:43.880,"Are you sure you know what you're doing, darling?"
00:12:43.880,00:12:46.920,"Ho, ho. Of course I know what I'm doing."
00:12:46.920,00:12:48.320,I'm king.
00:12:58.920,00:13:03.440,"Oh, I'm afraid insects are not allowed inside the castle."
00:13:03.440,00:13:05.760,"It's all right, Nanny Plum."
00:13:05.760,00:13:09.440,Daddy's invited Gaston to stay with us.
00:13:09.440,00:13:11.800,Oh. Very well then.
00:13:15.400,00:13:17.360,Gaston.
00:13:19.200,00:13:22.000,NANNY PLUM: I hope he's going to learn to wipe his feet.
00:13:22.000,00:13:23.560,"KING: Gaston isn't well, Nanny."
00:13:25.040,00:13:26.840,KING: And he hasn't got anywhere to stay.
00:13:26.840,00:13:30.320,I'm still not sure it's a good idea for him to stay with us.
00:13:33.960,00:13:36.760,QUEEN: So where is he going to sit?
00:13:36.760,00:13:38.960,He can sit on this little chair.
00:13:40.520,00:13:43.080,"Nanny Plum, you can speak ladybird."
00:13:43.080,00:13:44.280,What's he saying?
00:13:44.280,00:13:47.800,Gaston says this chair is too little.
00:13:47.800,00:13:52.400,"Ah, no."
00:13:52.400,00:13:54.640,"Ho, ho."
00:13:54.640,00:13:58.320,The queen doesn't mind.
00:13:59.800,00:14:04.440,NANNY PLUM: Gaston says this chair is too hard.
00:14:06.680,00:14:10.000,"Ahem. Actually, Gaston, that's my chair."
00:14:15.000,00:14:16.320,Goodness.
00:14:16.320,00:14:18.160,It's like having Goldilocks to stay.
00:14:20.000,00:14:25.480,"Never mind, Daddy, you can sit on this little chair."
00:14:28.680,00:14:31.560,"Yummy. Thanks, Nanny."
00:14:31.560,00:14:34.240,"Yes, this food is delicious."
00:14:35.440,00:14:41.560,I suppose I'd better magic up some special ladybird food.
00:14:48.840,00:14:50.680,ALL: Smelly welly.
00:14:57.960,00:15:00.120,"Uh, why isn't he eating it then?"
00:15:00.120,00:15:02.880,Gaston says it's too cold.
00:15:06.800,00:15:11.320,"Daddy, I think he wants to try your food."
00:15:18.720,00:15:21.720,Gaston says it's just right.
00:15:27.040,00:15:29.480,HOLLY: It's such fun having Gaston visit us.
00:15:29.480,00:15:34.080,"Can he stay with us forever and ever, Daddy?"
00:15:34.080,00:15:36.480,"Uh, maybe not forever."
00:15:36.480,00:15:38.880,But he can stay until his house is mended.
00:15:38.880,00:15:40.680,"HOLLY: Oh, goody."
00:15:42.160,00:15:46.120,And the weather in little kingdom today will be bright and sunny everywhere.
00:15:46.120,00:15:49.080,"Look, King Thistle, Gaston's getting better."
00:15:49.080,00:15:51.440,Splendid.
00:15:51.440,00:15:55.080,...and the pixie pound has seen a drop to the goblin dollar.
00:15:55.080,00:16:00.000,"NANNY PLUM: Um, Gaston says that this TV program is a bit boring."
00:16:00.000,00:16:01.120,How about this one?
00:16:03.000,00:16:05.840,NANNY PLUM: And this program's too noisy.
00:16:05.840,00:16:08.280,Hm...
00:16:08.280,00:16:11.880,NANNY PLUM: Ah. This program is just right.
00:16:14.480,00:16:18.000,"Look, Daddy, Gaston's not sneezing anymore."
00:16:18.000,00:16:22.880,"So, uh, now Gaston's better, maybe he can go home."
00:16:22.880,00:16:28.360,"But, Daddy, Gaston can't go home until his home is mended."
00:16:28.360,00:16:33.040,"He might catch another cold, and then he'll be sad."
00:16:33.040,00:16:36.120,"Yes, we wouldn't want Gaston to be sad."
00:16:42.680,00:16:44.240,"Thank you, Gaston."
00:16:44.240,00:16:47.920,"Uh, maybe I'll go and see how the elves are getting on at your cave."
00:16:52.040,00:16:54.440,How much longer is this going to take?
00:16:54.440,00:16:59.600,"As we builders say, there's no point in rushing things."
00:16:59.600,00:17:02.960,"Well, maybe a little rushing wouldn't do any harm?"
00:17:02.960,00:17:07.320,"I'm afraid we have a lot of problems to deal with, Your Majesty."
00:17:07.320,00:17:13.240,"Uh, it's probably a silly idea, but have you tried moving that pebble over the hole?"
00:17:13.240,00:17:15.480,"WISE OLD ELF: Ho, ho. You're right."
00:17:15.480,00:17:17.560,That is a silly idea.
00:17:17.560,00:17:19.880,Maybe it's still worth a try?
00:17:19.880,00:17:24.920,"With respect, Your Majesty, we each have our jobs to do."
00:17:24.920,00:17:28.800,"You're the king, and I'm the builder."
00:17:28.800,00:17:30.440,Of course.
00:17:37.960,00:17:40.200,It's been a long day.
00:17:40.200,00:17:42.240,I think I'll go to bed early.
00:17:42.240,00:17:45.680,"Uh, Your Majesty, that might be a problem."
00:17:45.680,00:17:46.840,What do you mean?
00:17:49.600,00:17:50.840,Yes?
00:17:50.840,00:17:56.000,Nanny magicked this basket for Gaston to sleep in.
00:17:56.000,00:17:57.160,"Well done, Nanny."
00:17:57.160,00:17:59.960,But the basket was too drafty.
00:18:01.240,00:18:05.640,"Then he tried my bed, but that was too soft."
00:18:05.640,00:18:09.080,"Oh, dear. I don't like the sound of this."
00:18:23.680,00:18:25.520,What's he saying now?
00:18:25.520,00:18:29.760,Gaston says he is very tired and would like to go to sleep now.
00:18:35.440,00:18:39.640,"Good night, Gaston."
00:18:39.640,00:18:43.360,So where are we going to sleep?
00:18:49.320,00:18:52.680,That was the most uncomfortable night ever.
00:18:57.320,00:19:00.720,I did say he could stay here until his cave was mended.
00:19:00.720,00:19:02.800,And how long will that take?
00:19:02.800,00:19:04.720,I don't know.
00:19:04.720,00:19:07.200,Let's go and see how those elves are getting on.
00:19:13.680,00:19:18.160,"Gaston really misses his home, Wise Old Elf."
00:19:18.160,00:19:20.080,Good news.
00:19:20.080,00:19:24.320,"We've replaced the rotting wood, plastered the ceiling..."
00:19:24.320,00:19:25.480,And fixed the leak?
00:19:25.480,00:19:27.840,"WISE OLD ELF: No, not yet."
00:19:27.840,00:19:31.040,"But I'm sure, in time, we'll sort it out."
00:19:37.480,00:19:41.800,Hooray! King Thistle's mended Gaston's cave.
00:19:43.440,00:19:46.280,"Amazing work, Your Majesty."
00:19:46.280,00:19:49.840,Have you ever thought of becoming a builder yourself?
00:19:49.840,00:19:51.720,"Uh, actually, no."
00:19:51.720,00:19:55.000,I think I'll just stick to being king.
00:19:55.000,00:19:58.760,"Look, Gaston, your cave's ready."
00:20:10.040,00:20:11.680,"Bye-bye, Gaston."
00:20:14.640,00:20:17.400,We'll be so sad to see you go.
00:20:19.640,00:20:25.320,"Gaston says he doesn't want you to be sad, so he'll come and stay with you for a bit longer."
00:20:30.520,00:20:33.880,"NANNY PLUM: Gaston insists, Your Majesty."
00:20:36.840,00:20:39.040,ALL CHILDREN: Hooray!
00:00:01.440,00:00:10.040,"NARRATOR: Somewhere hidden amongst thorny brambles, is a little kingdom of elves and fairies."
00:00:10.040,00:00:15.080,"Everyone who lives here is very, very small."
00:00:22.360,00:00:24.120,"Come on, let's play."
00:00:35.760,00:00:42.400,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Great Elf Tree.
00:00:51.200,00:00:53.680,Let's set off to the seaside.
00:00:56.320,00:01:00.200,"Well, where is she?"
00:01:02.800,00:01:04.200,Where is she?
00:01:08.080,00:01:10.400,But Princess Holly's late.
00:01:10.400,00:01:13.360,Fairies are always late.
00:01:13.360,00:01:15.320,"Hi, Ben."
00:01:16.840,00:01:19.120,"I'm not too early, am I?"
00:01:19.120,00:01:23.040,"No, Princess Holly."
00:01:23.040,00:01:26.320,"Ahem. Now we're all here, let's go."
00:01:28.520,00:01:33.800,"If he wants to get to the seaside quickly, I could try magicking us there."
00:01:38.600,00:01:40.880,"Oh, sorry, Mr. Elf."
00:01:40.880,00:01:44.840,"You see, Holly, you're coming on an Elf day trip."
00:01:47.400,00:01:49.160,ELVES: And we're elves.
00:01:51.120,00:01:55.200,"Hop in, everyone."
00:01:57.400,00:02:01.240,Here's the timetable.
00:02:01.240,00:02:09.200,"2, play in the sand, 3, tidy up, 4, leave seaside, arriving home at 4:30 precisely."
00:02:09.200,00:02:12.640,"Dad, it's a holiday."
00:02:12.640,00:02:16.280,"Sorry, Ben, it's just that I'm not used to having a day off."
00:02:16.280,00:02:19.440,"You work too hard, Mr. Elf."
00:02:19.440,00:02:21.560,Please try and relax today.
00:02:21.560,00:02:24.160,"Ah, I'll do my best, Mrs. Elf."
00:02:31.400,00:02:33.320,"Here we are, seaside."
00:02:35.240,00:02:37.400,HOLLY: And sand.
00:02:39.960,00:02:43.160,"Ah, I love the seaside."
00:02:43.160,00:02:44.960,Come on. Let's have lunch.
00:02:44.960,00:02:47.240,"Good idea, I'm hungry."
00:02:47.240,00:02:48.840,Me too.
00:02:50.640,00:02:52.600,Here's our picnic basket.
00:02:52.600,00:02:56.520,"Ooh, I love picnic baskets."
00:03:04.360,00:03:06.280,There won't be any magic.
00:03:07.680,00:03:11.080,Mrs. Elf always makes a really lovely picnic.
00:03:11.080,00:03:12.880,"Thanks, Mr. Elf."
00:03:12.880,00:03:15.640,"But, of course, you made the picnic this time."
00:03:15.640,00:03:17.720,Didn't you make it?
00:03:17.720,00:03:19.000,BOTH: Oh.
00:03:19.000,00:03:20.200,What's wrong?
00:03:20.200,00:03:21.880,We forgot to bring the picnic.
00:03:21.880,00:03:24.320,We just brought an empty basket.
00:03:24.320,00:03:26.760,But that's what I was saying.
00:03:26.760,00:03:32.120,We fairies always take an empty basket on picnics.
00:03:32.120,00:03:38.960,"Magic basket, please Can I have, um Spaghetti Bolognese?"
00:03:43.080,00:03:45.040,That's because...
00:03:45.040,00:03:47.600,It isn't a magic basket.
00:03:50.480,00:03:54.080,Can't it even magic us a packet of crisps?
00:03:54.080,00:03:55.320,No.
00:03:56.840,00:03:58.240,"Uh, Holly?"
00:03:58.240,00:04:03.040,Remember what I said about not needing any magicking today?
00:04:03.040,00:04:04.400,"Yes, Mr. Elf?"
00:04:04.400,00:04:13.040,"Well, this is an emergency, so if you wouldn't mind doing a bit of-- Magicking! You want me to do magicking."
00:04:13.040,00:04:14.320,"ELVES: Yes, please."
00:04:20.920,00:04:23.000,"No, not magic jelly!"
00:04:23.000,00:04:25.880,"Right, too dangerous."
00:04:25.880,00:04:28.840,"Hm, I could try an ice cream spell."
00:04:28.840,00:04:30.360,That's easy.
00:04:34.280,00:04:35.760,Silly Ben.
00:04:38.360,00:04:40.440,That's what makes them fun.
00:04:40.440,00:04:44.200,"Well, without magic, we're not going to have anything to eat."
00:04:44.200,00:04:47.760,"That's right. Please, Holly, do your spell."
00:04:48.840,00:04:54.200,Abracadabra!
00:04:48.840,00:04:56.400,Ice cream ELVES: Hooray.
00:04:56.400,00:04:58.480,I'm afraid it's only vanilla.
00:05:01.280,00:05:04.760,That's fine.
00:05:07.280,00:05:08.920,Delicious.
00:05:08.920,00:05:11.280,Maybe magic can be useful sometimes.
00:05:11.280,00:05:13.280,"Thank you, Princess Holly."
00:05:13.280,00:05:15.520,"Heh, heh. You're welcome."
00:05:15.520,00:05:18.080,Ah. What shall we do next?
00:05:20.320,00:05:23.680,I love making sand castles.
00:05:23.680,00:05:27.200,Hm. What's the spell for sand castles?
00:05:27.200,00:05:31.640,"Holly, you don't need a spell to make sand castles."
00:05:31.640,00:05:42.000,"You fill the bucket with sand, turn it over, give it a tap, and bingo-- A sand castle."
00:05:42.000,00:05:44.160,Cool. Can I have a go?
00:05:52.800,00:05:56.520,"Ho-ho-ho. We'll make an elf of you yet, Holly."
00:06:00.600,00:06:01.800,Hee-hee-hee.
00:06:01.800,00:06:06.040,We'd need a huge bucket to make a sand castle that big.
00:06:06.040,00:06:08.920,"Uh, like that one?"
00:06:10.200,00:06:13.080,HOLLY: That's a very huge bucket.
00:06:13.080,00:06:16.360,It must have been left by big children.
00:06:16.360,00:06:19.600,There aren't any big people here now.
00:06:19.600,00:06:26.440,"Good thing. Big people have big feet, and you never know where they're going to step."
00:06:26.440,00:06:29.720,"Look, they've left some spades."
00:06:33.800,00:06:36.080,It could be our thank you for lunch.
00:06:36.080,00:06:38.360,"Good idea, Mr. Elf."
00:06:38.360,00:06:39.800,Can I help?
00:06:39.800,00:06:46.280,"No, no, no. Please just relax and enjoy watching elves doing what elves do best."
00:06:47.920,00:06:51.200,Elves are best at-- Making things.
00:06:51.200,00:06:53.720,ELVES: And we're elves.
00:06:58.440,00:07:18.360,"ELVES: Princess Holly, would you do the honors by tapping the bucket?"
00:07:29.600,00:07:31.120,Bingo.
00:07:31.120,00:07:33.280,Can we go inside?
00:07:33.280,00:07:34.880,But there isn't a door.
00:07:34.880,00:07:36.560,I'll soon sort that out.
00:07:43.880,00:07:45.800,Ah. There's your door.
00:07:47.080,00:07:53.360,"Since this is our very own castle, I've decided I'm not Princess Holly anymore."
00:07:53.360,00:07:55.880,I'm Queen Holly.
00:07:55.880,00:07:57.840,And I am King Ben.
00:08:00.280,00:08:02.680,"My, my."
00:08:02.680,00:08:07.720,"Oh, Dad. Can't we stay in the castle a little bit longer?"
00:08:07.720,00:08:13.440,"But the tide will be coming in soon, and-- Please, Mr. Elf, please, can we stay a bit?"
00:08:15.240,00:08:19.360,"We'll pack the car, but you must come when we call you."
00:08:19.360,00:08:20.520,"Yes, Mom."
00:08:20.520,00:08:22.240,We promise.
00:08:22.240,00:08:25.720,"Oh, look. The sea is coming closer."
00:08:25.720,00:08:29.640,That's great. Soon the castle will have a moat.
00:08:34.200,00:08:36.520,"Talking of Holly, let's fetch the children."
00:08:36.520,00:08:38.720,I don't want to go home.
00:08:38.720,00:08:43.160,I want to stay in our castle forever and ever.
00:08:43.160,00:08:45.680,"Oh, goodness."
00:08:45.680,00:08:47.280,Look how high the sea is.
00:08:47.280,00:08:49.360,Ben. Holly.
00:08:49.360,00:08:51.320,Leave the castle now.
00:08:51.320,00:08:54.760,We can't leave.
00:08:54.760,00:08:58.040,"Holly, you can fly to the shore."
00:08:58.040,00:08:59.520,Okay.
00:08:59.520,00:09:03.080,No. It's too windy to fly.
00:09:03.080,00:09:07.480,"Uh, Holly, maybe it's time to do a little magic."
00:09:13.600,00:09:17.760,"Here's your wand, Holly."
00:09:17.760,00:09:20.320,But what if it falls in the sea?
00:09:21.560,00:09:25.200,Mrs. Elf is very good at throwing things.
00:09:25.200,00:09:27.120,And I'm great at catching.
00:09:27.120,00:09:28.520,"Hee, hee. Okay."
00:09:35.800,00:09:37.400,"Yes, Mom."
00:09:37.400,00:09:40.800,"One, two, three-- Throw."
00:09:44.040,00:09:46.040,ALL: Hooray.
00:09:46.040,00:09:50.120,"Thanks, Ben."
00:09:50.120,00:09:59.320,"Sun, sea and sand Put Ben and me On dry land BOTH: Whee."
00:09:59.320,00:10:02.280,BOTH: Hooray. Well done.
00:10:10.080,00:10:13.840,"It's so nice to have you back, wand."
00:10:17.480,00:10:21.880,"Thanks, Holly, and I knew you could magic us to safety."
00:10:21.880,00:10:27.920,Yes. The rescue was a perfect mix of fairy magic and elf skill.
00:10:38.680,00:10:45.440,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Great Elf Tree.
00:10:53.800,00:10:56.720,"BOTH: Happy birthday, Ben."
00:10:58.240,00:11:00.000,Here's your card.
00:11:02.280,00:11:05.040,"Cor, a space rocket."
00:11:05.040,00:11:07.240,And here's your present.
00:11:09.360,00:11:12.120,Wow. A space mobile.
00:11:20.880,00:11:24.840,"And later, all your friends will be coming to your birthday party."
00:11:27.440,00:11:28.920,Who can that be?
00:11:31.720,00:11:33.120,"Hi, Ben."
00:11:33.120,00:11:34.360,"Hi, Holly."
00:11:39.400,00:11:41.840,Have you brought me a birthday card?
00:11:48.440,00:11:51.520,"Oh, uh, happy birthday, Ben."
00:11:54.200,00:11:57.160,"Uh, I've just got to pop back home for something."
00:11:57.160,00:11:58.440,Oh.
00:11:58.440,00:11:59.920,See you later.
00:12:01.200,00:12:04.120,"Oh, dear. Oh, dear."
00:12:04.120,00:12:06.640,I've forgotten Ben's birthday.
00:12:27.040,00:12:30.720,I've forgotten Ben's birthday.
00:12:35.960,00:12:38.680,"No, no!"
00:12:38.680,00:12:42.160,I have to do something for this birthday.
00:12:42.160,00:12:44.640,Ben is my best friend.
00:12:44.640,00:12:46.160,Oh.
00:12:46.160,00:12:50.960,"I've got to make a birthday card really quickly, but I don't know where to start."
00:12:50.960,00:12:54.200,What you need is a little magic to get you going.
00:12:54.200,00:12:55.720,Ahem.
00:12:55.720,00:13:05.000,"Milk, flower, egg and sugar Paint, brushes Card and glitter Hee, hee."
00:13:05.000,00:13:09.560,Now I've got a very nice spell for making birthday cards.
00:13:09.560,00:13:16.720,It goes: Hocus pocus plinkity plonk-- KING: Nanny Plum.
00:13:16.720,00:13:18.720,Oh.
00:13:18.720,00:13:22.280,I better go and see what King Thistle wants.
00:13:27.000,00:13:29.280,"Yes, Your Majesty?"
00:13:29.280,00:13:32.000,Hm. This chair is a bit hard.
00:13:32.000,00:13:36.040,Can you do a magic spell to make me more comfortable?
00:13:39.880,00:13:42.280,You could do a magic spell yourself.
00:13:42.280,00:13:44.520,But my wand is over there.
00:13:44.520,00:13:46.960,Oh. Okay.
00:13:46.960,00:13:55.680,"Humpfy, lumpfy, dumfy Make King Thistle Nice and comfy Ah, that's better."
00:13:55.680,00:13:58.240,"And some music, please."
00:13:59.480,00:14:10.640,"Tra la la, tra la lin Music, please, sweet violin Ah, lovely."
00:14:10.640,00:14:13.640,Thank you.
00:14:19.600,00:14:24.160,"You'd just said, Hocus pocus, plinkity plonk."
00:14:35.120,00:14:37.680,KING: Nanny!
00:14:37.680,00:14:40.560,I want a cup of tea!
00:14:43.840,00:14:47.320,"Ah, this card will never get made."
00:14:47.320,00:14:50.520,I'll just have to do the magic myself.
00:14:54.320,00:14:56.760,"Hm. Ah, yes."
00:15:01.720,00:15:13.400,"Make me a birthday card Super-duper quick Hee, hee. It worked."
00:15:22.760,00:15:25.080,"Come on, silly paintbrushes."
00:15:32.320,00:15:34.560,You naughty paintbrushes.
00:15:34.560,00:15:39.120,I'll do a stronger spell to make you go faster.

00:16:30.800,00:16:33.840,"Nanny, make the magic stop."
00:16:33.840,00:16:47.720,"Thunder and lightning North winds blow Magic spells, away you go Thank you, Nanny."
00:16:47.720,00:16:54.120,"Yes, but I've to stop all the fairy magic in the castle."
00:16:58.200,00:17:01.160,Oof. What happened to the magic?
00:17:04.600,00:17:06.240,Ahem.
00:17:06.240,00:17:16.680,"There was a little problem in the kitchen, and I've had to stop all the fairy magic in the castle for one day, Your Majesties. Sorry."
00:17:16.680,00:17:18.520,Oh.
00:17:18.520,00:17:22.520,And the weather in the Little Kingdom today will be bright and sunny everywhere.
00:17:22.520,00:17:28.680,"Hang on. If you've stopped all the magic in the castle, why is the TV still working?"
00:17:28.680,00:17:31.760,"Uh, the TV's not magic."
00:17:31.760,00:17:34.240,Isn't it? Really?
00:17:34.240,00:17:36.200,ALL: Oh.
00:17:44.920,00:17:47.280,Really? Could I?
00:17:47.280,00:17:48.760,And I can help you.
00:17:48.760,00:17:53.120,"Uh, Nanny Plum, I think you'll be busy cleaning up the kitchen."
00:17:53.120,00:17:57.640,That will take but a moment with my fairy magic wand.
00:17:57.640,00:17:59.240,But there isn't any magic.
00:18:02.760,00:18:04.960,"Oh, yes."
00:18:09.520,00:18:12.200,"Hee, hee."
00:18:12.200,00:18:15.960,Hm.
00:18:15.960,00:18:19.480,I think I'll start with a picture of Ben.
00:18:24.360,00:18:28.360,Heh-heh-heh. It's easy doing things without magic.
00:18:28.360,00:18:31.480,"Yes, really easy."
00:18:32.640,00:18:36.040,"HOLLY: Now, lots of kisses for Ben..."
00:18:38.200,00:18:40.960,and some sparkly glitter.
00:18:42.680,00:18:45.520,There. Lovely.
00:18:46.880,00:18:51.440,"Yes, it's amazing what can be done without using magic."
00:18:51.440,00:18:55.000,"Yes, Nanny Plum, it is."
00:18:56.280,00:19:00.000,"Heh, now quick, or you'll be late for Ben's birthday party."
00:19:06.640,00:19:10.120,Ben's going to love his birthday card.
00:19:19.000,00:19:20.280,"Hi, Holly."
00:19:20.280,00:19:22.200,"Happy birthday, Ben."
00:19:22.200,00:19:23.680,Come in.
00:19:29.880,00:19:33.120,Ben's had lots of lovely cards today.
00:19:39.320,00:19:43.960,I made my card with a computer.
00:19:43.960,00:19:45.320,Oh.
00:19:48.480,00:19:50.480,That's nice.
00:19:50.480,00:19:54.040,"Holly, can I have your card now, please?"
00:19:57.480,00:20:03.480,I didn't use magic or a computer or buy it from a shop.
00:20:03.480,00:20:06.480,"Uh, I made it myself."
00:20:13.240,00:20:15.160,ALL: Ooh.
00:20:15.160,00:20:17.840,"ALL: Happy birthday, Ben."
00:20:22.040,00:20:26.480,"Uh, actually, Ben, I did forget your birthday."
00:20:26.480,00:20:30.920,"Yes, I know. You always forget my birthday."
00:20:30.920,00:20:32.400,Do I?
00:20:32.400,00:20:34.720,"Yes, but it doesn't matter."
00:00:36.600,00:00:43.440,Today's adventure starts at the little castle.
00:00:48.520,00:00:52.200,This is a perfect day for a royal fairy picnic.
00:00:52.200,00:00:53.880,"Good idea, Queen Thistle."
00:00:53.880,00:00:56.760,Hooray! I love picnics.
00:00:56.760,00:01:01.000,"Nanny Plum, prepare the royal picnic basket."
00:01:01.000,00:01:02.320,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:01:02.320,00:01:05.040,And will we be having magic jelly for pudding?
00:01:05.040,00:01:09.680,"Uh, maybe we should give the magic jelly a miss this year."
00:01:09.680,00:01:12.400,But we always have magic jelly at the royal picnic.
00:01:18.520,00:01:22.600,"Trust me, Your Majesty, nothing will go wrong this time."
00:01:22.600,00:01:26.240,"Mommy, can Ben come on the picnic?"
00:01:30.720,00:01:35.240,Please can Ben come?
00:01:35.240,00:01:38.480,"Well, I suppose, as he's your best friend."
00:01:38.480,00:01:40.240,Hooray! I'll ring him.
00:01:53.880,00:01:55.560,Right-o.
00:01:55.560,00:01:58.240,"Ben, it's Princess Holly."
00:01:58.240,00:01:59.400,"Hi, Holly."
00:01:59.400,00:02:01.480,"Hi, Ben."
00:02:03.760,00:02:05.120,"Yes, please."
00:02:05.120,00:02:09.400,Good. Come to the castle as quick as you can.
00:02:09.400,00:02:13.440,Mom. I've been invited on the royal fairy picnic.
00:02:13.440,00:02:15.160,How lovely.
00:02:15.160,00:02:18.520,"You'll need plenty of food, so you have enough to share."
00:02:18.520,00:02:20.240,What would you like?
00:02:24.280,00:02:27.960,I'll put in a whole strawberry.
00:02:30.280,00:02:31.480,"Thanks, Mom."
00:02:31.480,00:02:33.680,Bye.
00:02:39.680,00:02:42.640,"Look everyone, it's Ben."
00:02:42.640,00:02:43.840,"Hello, everyone."
00:02:43.840,00:02:45.720,"Ha, ha. This should be fun."
00:02:45.720,00:02:48.280,We've never had an elf on our royal picnic before.
00:02:48.280,00:02:50.360,Heh.
00:02:53.720,00:02:56.120,"Oh, thanks, Ben."
00:02:56.120,00:02:58.800,"Oh, but it's really light."
00:02:58.800,00:03:01.000,It's a magic basket.
00:03:12.520,00:03:15.160,Look.
00:03:18.840,00:03:21.960,Daddy?
00:03:21.960,00:03:24.120,"Hm, I'm not sure."
00:03:25.920,00:03:27.280,What did he say?
00:03:27.280,00:03:31.000,Nanny Plum can speak ladybird language.
00:03:32.760,00:03:39.680,"Gaston says he would like the pleasure of joining Princess Holly and Ben Elf on the royal fairy picnic, Your Majesty."
00:03:39.680,00:03:41.560,Very well.
00:03:41.560,00:03:44.400,It's just a pity he's a bit smelly.
00:03:46.560,00:03:49.280,"Nanny Plum, can you translate that?"
00:03:49.280,00:03:51.240,"Yes, I can, but I'd rather not."
00:03:56.520,00:04:00.360,"Ah, here we are."
00:04:00.360,00:04:01.680,ALL: Hooray!
00:04:04.320,00:04:05.560,What's this?
00:04:05.560,00:04:07.480,"It's food, for the picnic."
00:04:11.480,00:04:13.560,"Uh, yes."
00:04:13.560,00:04:17.960,"It's probably some strange elf custom, Your Majesty."
00:04:17.960,00:04:20.640,"Ha, ha. How charming."
00:04:20.640,00:04:23.480,I've got plenty of food for everyone.
00:04:23.480,00:04:27.320,"Thanks, Ben, but fairies don't eat elf food."
00:04:27.320,00:04:31.120,We have our own special fairy food.
00:04:31.120,00:04:32.360,Here it is.
00:04:32.360,00:04:34.920,Oh. But the basket is empty.
00:04:34.920,00:04:36.840,You've forgotten your food.
00:04:41.520,00:04:44.480,It's a magic picnic basket.
00:04:44.480,00:04:47.240,It can give us anything we want.
00:04:47.240,00:04:49.080,Let's start with the drinks.
00:04:49.080,00:04:52.840,I feel like some sparkling fairy juice.
00:04:52.840,00:05:03.680,"Magic basket, oh, so old Let's have fairy juice Sparkling and cold BEN: Wow."
00:05:03.680,00:05:06.520,"Yes, young elf."
00:05:06.520,00:05:10.240,"Ben, perhaps you would like to choose the drinks for the children?"
00:05:10.240,00:05:13.000,It can be anything you like.
00:05:13.000,00:05:14.160,Anything?
00:05:14.160,00:05:17.120,Can I really ask for anything?
00:05:19.320,00:05:21.400,Hm. Okay.
00:05:23.280,00:05:25.720,Isn't that a bit boring and ordinary?
00:05:25.720,00:05:29.560,"Elves like lemonade, and I'm an elf."
00:05:31.400,00:05:37.360,"But, Ben, you can have anything you like in the whole wide world."
00:05:42.000,00:05:45.360,Are you sure you wouldn't like something more exotic?
00:05:45.360,00:05:49.720,Okay. Lemonade with two dollops of ice cream.
00:05:49.720,00:05:52.120,"Heh. Good choice, Ben."
00:05:52.120,00:06:01.280,"Magic Basket, please Lemonade with lots of ice cream BEN: Hooray!"
00:06:01.280,00:06:03.160,"Thanks, Holly."
00:06:06.560,00:06:10.320,"Hm, what do ladybirds like to drink?"
00:06:15.120,00:06:29.040,"By a ladybird's growl May the next drink be foul Nanny, you've made it too stinky, even for Gaston."
00:06:29.040,00:06:31.280,NANNY: Nonsense.
00:06:31.280,00:06:33.720,Ladybirds love rotten cabbage juice.
00:06:35.200,00:06:36.720,Mm...
00:06:38.560,00:06:47.360,"Magic basket, please Make us sandwiches With ham and cheese CHILDREN: Ooh."
00:06:47.360,00:06:49.800,And now for pudding.
00:06:49.800,00:06:52.720,Hooray! Magic jelly.
00:06:52.720,00:06:56.880,"Uh, Nanny Plum, please don't make too much this time."
00:06:56.880,00:07:00.080,We don't want a repeat of last year's jelly flood.
00:07:00.080,00:07:01.600,What happened?
00:07:01.600,00:07:05.120,"Holly, Daisy and Poppy always help me make the pudding."
00:07:05.120,00:07:11.040,"But last year, we made a bit too much and we-- Flooded the whole kingdom with jelly."
00:07:11.040,00:07:14.600,Heh. I remember.
00:07:14.600,00:07:15.960,Was that you?
00:07:15.960,00:07:18.640,Heh. Yes. That was us.
00:07:18.640,00:07:21.120,It was rather spectacular.
00:07:22.440,00:07:25.960,"But it's not going to happen again, is it, Nanny Plum?"
00:07:28.040,00:07:31.640,We've been practicing safe new words that keeps the quantity down.
00:07:33.280,00:07:34.560,Can I help too?
00:07:34.560,00:07:36.200,"NANNY: Yes, Ben."
00:07:36.200,00:07:55.320,"Children, repeat after me: Magic basket, please Jelly, jelly, but not a lot ALL: Magic basket, please Jelly, jelly But not a lot Hooray!"
00:07:55.320,00:07:57.080,They're a bit small.
00:07:57.080,00:07:59.200,"They are quite little, aren't they?"
00:07:59.200,00:08:02.240,"Yes, we'll need more."
00:08:04.640,00:08:19.760,"Basket, basket More, more, more ALL: Basket, basket More, more, more Phew."
00:08:17.520,00:08:23.560,For a moment there I thought we were going to have another jelly flood.
00:08:24.720,00:08:26.240,BOTH: Jelly flood. Jelly flood.
00:08:26.240,00:08:27.920,Jelly flood.
00:08:31.880,00:08:33.560,Jelly flood!
00:08:35.000,00:08:38.080,"Nanny, there's too much jelly."
00:08:38.080,00:08:39.440,"KING: Stop it, Nanny."
00:08:39.440,00:08:49.480,"Shazam, shazing Magic pudding Shrink, shrink, shrink Nanny. Try a stronger spell."
00:08:49.480,00:08:57.160,"I could use the stop magic spell, but that's only for royal emergencies."
00:08:57.160,00:09:00.920,I declare this a royal emergency.
00:09:13.680,00:09:15.680,ALL: Hooray!
00:09:15.680,00:09:18.400,"Nanny, where's our food?"
00:09:18.400,00:09:24.680,"Sorry, I had to stop all the magic, and that included our magic picnic."
00:09:24.680,00:09:28.960,"That's strange, my food is still here."
00:09:28.960,00:09:31.360,That's because it wasn't made by magic.
00:09:31.360,00:09:34.800,"And luckily, I've enough for everyone."
00:09:34.800,00:09:36.520,"Thank you, Ben."
00:09:36.520,00:09:40.880,"But, Nanny, you said fairies don't eat elf food."
00:09:40.880,00:09:42.840,"Uh, yes."
00:09:45.280,00:09:47.800,We can have a nice time without a picnic.
00:09:47.800,00:09:51.000,Let's sit and enjoy the view.
00:09:52.400,00:09:54.400,Mm. Yummy.
00:09:56.280,00:10:00.920,I'm a bit hungry Me too.
00:10:07.960,00:10:09.920,"Would you like to try some, King Thistle?"
00:10:10.880,00:10:13.120,"Oh. Thank you, Ben."
00:10:15.560,00:10:19.240,Mm. Elf food is delicious.
00:10:19.240,00:10:20.560,It really is.
00:10:20.560,00:10:22.720,"Nanny Plum, you must try some."
00:10:27.920,00:10:30.560,And here's another royal command.
00:10:41.160,00:10:46.680,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at Gaston's cave.
00:10:57.520,00:10:58.720,Gaston!

00:11:23.480,00:11:25.840,"Heh. Yes, we can."
00:11:32.440,00:11:35.080,Gaston loves fetching sticks.
00:11:36.280,00:11:37.880,"Gaston, fetch."
00:11:51.960,00:11:54.880,"Clever, Gaston."

00:12:02.520,00:12:04.640,Wiggle your legs.
00:12:06.320,00:12:08.920,HOLLY: Gaston loves rolling on his back.
00:12:08.920,00:12:11.120,That's funny.
00:12:16.200,00:12:18.440,Holly! Bedtime.
00:12:18.440,00:12:21.840,"Oh, that's Nanny Plum."
00:12:21.840,00:12:23.720,I've got to go home now.
00:12:33.440,00:12:35.480,Ben! Bedtime.
00:12:38.000,00:12:40.560,"Bye, Ben. Bye, Gaston."
00:12:40.560,00:12:41.720,"Bye, Holly."
00:12:41.720,00:12:44.200,"Bye, Gaston."
00:13:20.320,00:13:22.920,Ben. Gaston.
00:13:36.760,00:13:38.240,Where's Gaston?
00:13:38.240,00:13:40.560,He hasn't turned up yet.
00:13:40.560,00:13:42.840,Oh. Let's go and find him.
00:13:42.840,00:13:44.200,Okay.
00:13:47.480,00:13:48.600,Gaston?
00:13:48.600,00:13:50.840,Are you coming out to play?
00:13:56.000,00:13:57.880,HOLLY: Gaston!
00:14:01.680,00:14:03.560,Gaston's not answering.
00:14:06.720,00:14:08.600,But we have such fun together.
00:14:09.960,00:14:13.600,Like when I tip him over and he wiggles his feet.
00:14:13.600,00:14:15.800,And when I ride on his back.
00:14:26.120,00:14:28.920,Hm. Perhaps he doesn't.
00:14:35.120,00:14:37.960,"Oh, dear, what can we do?"
00:14:37.960,00:14:40.400,Nanny Plum will know what to do.
00:14:43.240,00:14:44.320,Good idea.
00:14:55.000,00:14:56.400,Nanny Plum!
00:14:56.400,00:15:00.000,Gaston the Ladybird is not happy.
00:15:00.000,00:15:01.440,Hm.
00:15:01.440,00:15:03.920,Ladybirds are never happy.
00:15:03.920,00:15:06.160,But Gaston is our best friend.
00:15:06.160,00:15:08.200,Can you do something?
00:15:08.200,00:15:10.200,"BOTH: Please, Nanny Plum."
00:15:13.960,00:15:16.520,"Thanks, Nanny."
00:15:45.200,00:15:47.320,This is Gaston's cave.
00:15:49.280,00:15:50.920,He's a ladybird.
00:15:50.920,00:15:52.440,"Oh, yes."
00:15:53.760,00:15:55.880,What's ladybird for hello?
00:16:02.560,00:16:03.800,"Oh, look."
00:16:03.800,00:16:05.080,The door's open.
00:16:05.080,00:16:08.120,We better take a look inside.
00:16:09.240,00:16:11.320,Gaston's not here.
00:16:15.880,00:16:18.240,No wonder Gaston is sad.
00:16:23.480,00:16:26.240,We need to clean this cave up before the ladybird returns.
00:16:26.240,00:16:29.280,Yes. That will be a nice surprise.
00:16:29.280,00:16:31.920,And Gaston will be happy again.
00:16:34.040,00:16:35.960,"First, we need my cleaning things."
00:16:46.120,00:16:47.760,"Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:16:47.760,00:16:49.520,"Ben, you clean the floor."
00:16:49.520,00:16:50.960,"Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:16:52.400,00:16:55.000,And I will tackle the bed.
00:17:22.360,00:17:32.040,Bish bash besh Gaston's bed Nice and fresh Good.
00:17:36.600,00:17:38.240,BOTH: Ooh!
00:17:42.080,00:17:44.520,BOTH: Hooray!
00:17:51.360,00:17:53.960,Quick. Gaston's coming.
00:17:59.320,00:18:01.360,We've come to cheer you up.
00:18:01.360,00:18:04.040,We don't like it when you're sad.
00:18:05.640,00:18:08.560,We're really sorry about rolling you over.
00:18:08.560,00:18:10.880,And riding on your back.
00:18:12.280,00:18:14.200,"What's he saying, Nanny?"
00:18:15.720,00:18:17.280,Ooh.
00:18:17.280,00:18:20.240,Gaston says he likes it when you roll him over and ride on his back.
00:18:20.240,00:18:21.520,BOTH: Oh.
00:18:23.200,00:18:26.880,NANNY: Gaston is not sad.
00:18:29.440,00:18:32.560,"Well, you're going to be even happier now."
00:18:41.280,00:18:42.960,Gaston.
00:18:45.720,00:18:49.920,"As I said, ladybirds are never happy."
00:18:49.920,00:18:52.960,"Gaston, what's wrong?"
00:18:56.280,00:18:59.120,"Nanny, what did he say?"
00:18:59.120,00:19:04.120,"He said he loved his home just as it was, all messy and smelly."
00:19:04.120,00:19:05.360,Oh.
00:19:05.360,00:19:07.400,"Sorry, Gaston."
00:19:11.000,00:19:12.440,Yes. Heh.
00:19:12.440,00:19:15.600,We're very good at making things messy.
00:19:20.120,00:19:22.360,Heh. This is fun.
00:19:29.880,00:19:43.800,"Zip zap zessy Gaston's bed, nice and messy Smelly socks..."
00:19:43.800,00:19:45.800,And lollypops.
00:19:47.160,00:19:51.960,"Good. Now just a final layer of dirt, and we're done."
00:19:56.080,00:19:57.920,"Well done, everybody."
00:19:57.920,00:20:00.680,That smells just as bad as it did before.
00:20:00.680,00:20:02.600,BOTH: Hooray!
00:20:04.040,00:20:10.960,"And if you ever want us to make your cave untidy again, Gaston, don't be afraid to ask."
00:20:10.960,00:20:14.000,"Yes, that's what friends are for."
00:20:15.680,00:20:18.120,"Come on, let's play."
00:20:23.760,00:20:26.680,"Come on, Gaston."
00:20:29.360,00:20:31.040,Yee-ha!
00:20:31.040,00:20:32.680,Can't catch me.
00:00:18.360,00:00:21.720,And I'm Princess Holly.
00:00:35.640,00:00:42.480,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the little castle.
00:00:49.480,00:00:53.000,"Nanny Plum, I'd like some bread with my egg please."
00:00:53.000,00:00:56.520,"I'm sorry, Your Majesty, we haven't any bread this morning."
00:00:58.040,00:01:00.320,Then please magic some up.
00:01:00.320,00:01:05.080,"I can't magic up bread without flour, and we've run out of flour."
00:01:05.080,00:01:07.880,"Well, can't we order more flour from the elves?"
00:01:07.880,00:01:11.920,"I have. But as usual, the Elf Truck is late."
00:01:26.160,00:01:27.520,Food delivery.
00:01:27.520,00:01:29.920,"At last, Mr. Elf."
00:01:40.480,00:01:43.560,That should make a splendid King's breakfast.
00:01:43.560,00:01:46.040,"Yes, yes, thank you, Mr. Elf."
00:01:46.040,00:01:48.960,But the only thing I need today is flour.
00:01:48.960,00:01:52.040,Flour?
00:01:59.880,00:02:01.440,"Thank you, Mr. Elf."
00:02:01.440,00:02:05.680,"Let's see, we should be able to deliver it next week."
00:02:09.400,00:02:14.200,"Ah, you know what they say, You can't rush the Elf Windmill."
00:02:18.520,00:02:20.000,"Of course, Nanny Plum."
00:02:20.000,00:02:21.800,We can take you if you like.
00:02:24.160,00:02:25.960,Can I come too?
00:02:25.960,00:02:28.680,"Of course. Hop aboard, Princess Holly."
00:02:54.720,00:02:57.600,There's the windmill.
00:03:00.200,00:03:01.680,HOLLY: Wow.
00:03:03.120,00:03:05.760,"Hello, Ben."
00:03:13.560,00:03:18.760,Certainly. We should have a bag of flour ready in a week.
00:03:27.640,00:03:30.960,Don't you know how a windmill makes flour?
00:03:30.960,00:03:33.120,Of course I do.
00:03:33.120,00:03:34.640,Um...
00:03:34.640,00:03:38.440,"Wise Old Elf, can you show us how it makes flour?"
00:03:49.520,00:03:53.760,"Now, can anyone tell me what this is?"
00:03:53.760,00:03:55.240,It's an elf.
00:03:55.240,00:03:59.960,"Heh. No, no."
00:03:59.960,00:04:01.720,It's wheat.
00:04:01.720,00:04:03.000,"Very good, Ben."
00:04:03.000,00:04:07.400,And who knows what we do with wheat at the Elf Windmill?
00:04:07.400,00:04:12.160,"I know. We take the wheat and we-- One moment, Ben."
00:04:12.160,00:04:16.000,Let's give the fairies a chance to tell us.
00:04:16.000,00:04:17.360,Um...
00:04:17.360,00:04:19.520,Is it for sweeping the floor?
00:04:24.960,00:04:28.960,First we put the wheat in this funnel.
00:04:41.120,00:04:43.760,That doesn't look like flour.
00:04:43.760,00:04:47.280,"We haven't finished yet, Princess Holly."
00:04:48.520,00:04:56.200,"The wind turns the sails, the sails turn the cogs."
00:04:57.800,00:05:01.720,And the cogs turn the grindstone.
00:05:02.960,00:05:06.960,The grindstone crushes the grains of wheat.
00:05:06.960,00:05:12.240,And out comes top quality elf flour.
00:05:13.960,00:05:16.240,It's very slow.
00:05:20.400,00:05:22.680,NANNY: Why can't it go faster?
00:05:26.160,00:05:33.040,"So if we could make the wind go faster, the mill would go faster too?"
00:05:33.040,00:05:38.000,"Heh, yes, but we can't make the wind go faster."
00:05:39.600,00:05:43.800,"Oh. Now, I'm not sure you should use magic."
00:05:52.720,00:05:58.200,"No, Princess Holly, you're much too young for dangerous weather spells."
00:05:59.760,00:06:03.440,But you can watch me and see how it's done.
00:06:03.440,00:06:22.800,"Blow wind, do your stuff with all your might puff, puff, puff There."
00:06:22.800,00:06:24.800,"Um, well..."
00:06:27.040,00:06:30.200,The windmill's going faster and faster.
00:06:32.480,00:06:34.160,I know what I'm doing.
00:06:42.600,00:06:44.880,Me? No.
00:06:44.880,00:06:48.360,"I didn't magic up thunder, just wind."
00:06:51.480,00:06:55.920,"Are you sure you haven't made a storm, Nanny?"
00:06:55.920,00:07:02.480,"Yes. Well, wind, storm, hurricane, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference."
00:07:02.480,00:07:08.040,"Phew, we're making so much flour, we're running out of sacks."
00:07:18.760,00:07:20.840,"Oh, stop fussing."
00:07:20.840,00:07:22.880,It'll get better in a moment.
00:07:22.880,00:07:24.920,It can't get any worse.
00:07:26.080,00:07:27.360,Aah!
00:07:29.880,00:07:32.280,It's making too much flour.
00:07:42.440,00:07:45.240,BEN: Look how fast the sails are going.
00:07:45.240,00:07:46.760,Too fast.
00:07:48.800,00:07:51.400,It's filling up with flour.
00:07:51.400,00:07:53.880,Isn't that what it's supposed to do?
00:07:53.880,00:07:57.160,We have to slow the mill down.
00:07:57.160,00:07:59.360,All right.
00:07:59.360,00:08:03.400,I'll just do some more magic to stop the wind.
00:08:06.440,00:08:09.520,We've had quite enough of fairy magic.
00:08:09.520,00:08:12.840,Now it's time for some elf skill.
00:08:12.840,00:08:15.080,"What's your plan, Wise Old Elf?"
00:08:21.440,00:08:24.240,"Take hold of this rope, elves."
00:08:24.240,00:08:25.520,Right-o.
00:08:28.400,00:08:31.040,Are you sure this is a good idea?
00:08:31.040,00:08:36.280,We know what we're doing.
00:08:38.280,00:08:39.560,He's got it.
00:08:39.560,00:08:41.200,Hooray!
00:08:41.200,00:08:43.920,"Well done, Wise Old Elf."
00:08:43.920,00:08:51.840,Told you it would work-- I hope they're okay.
00:08:58.480,00:09:01.080,Elves are never happy.
00:09:05.760,00:09:11.360,"Maybe you can stop the spell now, Nanny Plum."
00:09:13.520,00:09:15.200,What did he say?
00:09:17.760,00:09:20.600,"Oh, okay."
00:09:20.600,00:09:25.240,"All winds, away you go."
00:09:33.440,00:09:36.200,"Wise Old Elf, are you all right?"
00:09:36.200,00:09:39.560,Of course I'm all right.
00:09:41.360,00:09:44.080,I'll just get my bag of flour.
00:09:44.080,00:09:49.880,"Nanny Plum, I strongly advise you not to open that door."
00:09:53.200,00:09:55.320,Aah!
00:10:08.840,00:10:10.600,There's your dad.
00:10:10.600,00:10:13.200,"Uh, hi, Dad."
00:10:13.200,00:10:15.640,"Ah, Mr. Elf."
00:10:15.640,00:10:20.160,Could you deliver one bag of flour for Nanny Plum?
00:10:21.880,00:10:23.680,I'll take it there right away.
00:10:23.680,00:10:25.320,Hooray!
00:10:25.320,00:10:27.760,Thank you.
00:10:27.760,00:10:30.720,That would be most kind.
00:10:50.000,00:10:53.080,I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
00:10:53.080,00:10:54.320,"What's that, darling?"
00:10:54.320,00:10:58.680,We've been invited to visit King and Queen Marigold this evening.
00:10:58.680,00:11:00.040,"Oh, dear."
00:11:00.040,00:11:04.120,King and Queen Marigold are boring and snooty!
00:11:04.120,00:11:08.160,They always make me feel like a country bumpkin.
00:11:08.160,00:11:10.080,So why are we visiting them?
00:11:10.080,00:11:14.360,Because they invited us and I didn't know how to say no!
00:11:14.360,00:11:16.000,I'm good at that sort of thing.
00:11:16.000,00:11:17.280,Leave it with me!
00:11:20.160,00:11:23.400,Hello.
00:11:23.400,00:11:24.800,KING: Queen Marigold?
00:11:24.800,00:11:28.080,King Thistle here.
00:11:24.800,00:11:30.680,"I'm terribly sorry, but Queen Thistle and I can't come tonight."
00:11:30.680,00:11:34.880,"Oh, no! We were so looking forward to seeing you."
00:11:34.880,00:11:37.040,"Yes, sorry about that."
00:11:40.240,00:11:41.440,A music concert!
00:11:41.440,00:11:44.120,What kind of music?
00:11:47.160,00:11:51.000,"Elf music? Oh, I don't believe I've heard of elf music."
00:11:54.640,00:11:59.080,Oh! King Marigold and I love good music.
00:11:59.080,00:12:01.560,Uh...
00:12:03.520,00:12:04.680,Oh.
00:12:04.680,00:12:06.680,See you tonight!
00:12:09.720,00:12:11.640,"Everything all right, darling?"
00:12:11.640,00:12:14.560,There's good news and bad news.
00:12:14.560,00:12:16.800,What's the good news?
00:12:16.800,00:12:19.440,We're not visiting King and Queen Marigold.
00:12:19.440,00:12:21.200,Hooray!
00:12:21.200,00:12:23.240,"So, what's the bad news?"
00:12:23.240,00:12:25.280,They're coming to see us instead.
00:12:25.280,00:12:26.560,"Oh, no!"
00:12:26.560,00:12:31.480,And they're expecting a concert of elf music.
00:12:31.480,00:12:34.800,"And I've, uh, told them that elf music sounds good."
00:12:34.800,00:12:38.320,Oh! But the Elf Band sound terrible!
00:12:38.320,00:12:40.880,They're the only elf music we've got!
00:12:40.880,00:12:42.600,They're an embarrassment!
00:12:42.600,00:12:44.680,They don't sound that bad.
00:12:44.680,00:12:48.920,"The last time they played, you said it was disgusting."
00:12:48.920,00:12:51.800,"Well, maybe they've got better?"
00:12:51.800,00:12:53.240,Nanny!
00:12:55.400,00:12:56.840,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:13:05.440,00:13:09.880,"The Elf Band at your service, Your Majesty."
00:13:09.880,00:13:15.960,"Wise Old Elf, we have some very important guests coming to visit."
00:13:18.720,00:13:22.240,They are very boring and snooty.
00:13:22.240,00:13:25.000,And they want to hear some elf music.
00:13:25.000,00:13:26.800,Have you been practicing?
00:13:26.800,00:13:33.560,"No, Your Majesty, you told us to never, ever play music again."
00:13:36.640,00:13:39.840,"Oh, it would be an honor, Your Majesty!"
00:13:45.640,00:13:47.760,Oompah! Oompah! Oompah!
00:13:58.840,00:14:02.440,Interesting.
00:14:03.960,00:14:05.680,I thought it was good.
00:14:05.680,00:14:11.560,"You might like it, Holly, but I'm sure King and Queen Marigold will not."
00:14:11.560,00:14:14.240,"If I might make a suggestion, Your Majesty?"
00:14:15.720,00:14:19.720,Princess Holly could play her recorder for the guests.
00:14:19.720,00:14:22.760,Yes! Nanny has been teaching me!
00:14:22.760,00:14:26.120,And Holly has been practicing.
00:14:37.560,00:14:39.840,What a charming little tune!
00:14:39.840,00:14:42.640,King and Queen Marigold would like that!
00:14:42.640,00:14:44.680,There is one problem.
00:14:44.680,00:14:49.320,"You've promised elf music, and Holly is not an elf."
00:14:49.320,00:14:52.000,I could magic some elf ears for Holly.
00:14:53.320,00:14:54.560,Ooh!
00:14:54.560,00:14:57.760,"No, thank you, Nanny!"
00:14:57.760,00:15:02.360,I know! Nanny can teach the Elf Band how to play Holly's tune!
00:15:11.680,00:15:13.440,Everybody on?
00:15:13.440,00:15:15.040,Yes.
00:15:15.040,00:15:17.360,Right-o. Off we go!
00:15:24.080,00:15:28.840,"Your instruments don't just sound funny, they look funny too."
00:15:28.840,00:15:31.120,They've got funny names as well!
00:15:31.120,00:15:34.160,This is called a Thrump Warbler.
00:15:36.280,00:15:38.800,That's the Sparl Throttle.
00:15:41.080,00:15:44.600,And this is the Blotto horn!
00:15:46.680,00:15:48.320,Delightful!
00:15:48.320,00:15:51.560,But they all sound silly!
00:15:56.480,00:15:58.600,Oompah! Oompah!
00:16:05.240,00:16:09.000,All right! All right!
00:16:09.000,00:16:14.120,"Princess Holly, could you remind us what your tune sounded like, please."
00:16:21.680,00:16:26.000,"Well, I haven't seen this particular piece before."
00:16:30.400,00:16:32.960,You played that perfectly!
00:16:32.960,00:16:37.640,"Perfect for you maybe, but it's not elf music!"
00:16:37.640,00:16:41.600,Elf music has Oompah Oompah. Like this!
00:16:41.600,00:16:43.440,"Oompah, oompah!"
00:16:48.040,00:16:51.400,Stop! Stop!
00:16:51.400,00:16:56.120,"Just remember, you are playing for King and Queen Marigold."
00:16:56.120,00:16:58.280,And they are very snooty.
00:16:58.280,00:17:04.800,"We like Oompah music, but King and Queen Marigold don't."
00:17:04.800,00:17:08.280,"Quite, so play Holly's tune, please."
00:17:17.640,00:17:19.360,Lovely!
00:17:23.320,00:17:27.320,"Uh, Holly, do the Elf Band sound any better?"
00:17:27.320,00:17:32.280,"Yes, Daddy! They've been practicing all day!"
00:17:32.280,00:17:34.800,Okay.
00:17:47.800,00:17:49.520,That's much better!
00:17:49.520,00:17:52.440,"Yes, it's charming."
00:17:49.520,00:17:54.680,But I still don't think King and Queen Marigold will like it.
00:17:54.680,00:17:56.080,"Why, Mommy?"
00:17:56.080,00:17:59.480,King and Queen Marigold don't like country things.
00:18:02.760,00:18:05.400,I can fix that!
00:18:05.400,00:18:10.160,I'll just use magic to make the instruments sound more normal.
00:18:10.160,00:18:12.560,"Play me a tune, Mr. Elf!"
00:18:25.040,00:18:30.680,Fantastic! That sounds exactly the sort of music King and Queen Marigold would like!
00:18:38.120,00:18:41.440,King and Queen Marigold!
00:18:41.440,00:18:46.160,"How delightful to see your little kingdom again, Queen Thistle."
00:18:46.160,00:18:52.080,It's always such a pleasure to experience your simple country life here.
00:18:52.080,00:18:55.880,We can't wait to hear some genuine elf music.
00:18:57.080,00:19:00.360,"Oh, yes, you must hear it!"
00:19:06.280,00:19:10.360,I take a special interest in the sound of this band.
00:19:17.840,00:19:23.160,"I must say, this is not at all what I expected elf music to sound like!"
00:19:26.240,00:19:31.200,"These elves play well, but the tune is a little old-fashioned."
00:19:31.200,00:19:35.120,QUEEN MARIGOLD: And their instruments sound very ordinary.
00:19:42.320,00:19:43.920,"Oh, I say!"
00:19:47.280,00:19:48.640,What's that?
00:19:55.840,00:19:57.560,Oompah! Oompah!
00:20:03.200,00:20:05.600,A fantastic performance!
00:20:05.600,00:20:07.280,So exciting!
00:20:08.440,00:20:10.440,"A triumph, King Thistle."
00:20:10.440,00:20:13.400,Have you ever considered teaching music?
00:20:13.400,00:20:14.760,"Ah, well, uh..."
00:20:14.760,00:20:16.680,"Let's dance, heh!"
00:20:22.920,00:20:24.800,"Come on, Mommy!"
00:20:24.800,00:20:29.360,King and Queen Marigold are not boring at all!
00:00:18.200,00:00:21.120,And I'm Princess Holly.
00:00:35.760,00:00:43.640,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:00:51.720,00:00:53.560,Do you have to knit?
00:00:55.920,00:00:58.640,Why does it have to be so noisy?
00:00:58.640,00:01:00.400,Someone's a bit grumpy.
00:01:00.400,00:01:01.720,I'm not grumpy.
00:01:03.080,00:01:04.960,Maybe you should have a hobby.
00:01:04.960,00:01:06.640,Like stamp collecting.
00:01:06.640,00:01:08.680,What's stamp collecting?
00:01:08.680,00:01:11.640,You collect stamps and put them in a book.
00:01:11.640,00:01:13.960,Why would anyone want to do that?
00:01:16.080,00:01:19.360,You look at trains and write down their numbers in a book.
00:01:19.360,00:01:21.680,No one would want to do that.
00:01:21.680,00:01:23.200,Or there's bird spotting?
00:01:23.200,00:01:24.560,Don't tell me.
00:01:26.840,00:01:28.760,"Yes, something like that."
00:01:28.760,00:01:30.520,I love birds.
00:01:30.520,00:01:32.560,"Please try it, Daddy."
00:01:33.760,00:01:35.920,Okay. What do I do?
00:01:35.920,00:01:42.600,"You'll need binoculars, a bird spotter's badge, and, of course, a book."
00:01:42.600,00:01:45.600,Welcome to the world of bird spotting.
00:01:55.760,00:01:58.000,"What sort of bird is it, Daddy?"
00:01:58.000,00:01:59.120,Um...
00:01:59.120,00:02:01.040,BOOK: It's a robin.
00:02:05.680,00:02:07.320,This is rather fun.
00:02:07.320,00:02:09.920,"Oh, there's another bird."
00:02:11.920,00:02:15.320,"Um, it's got a long, pointy beak."
00:02:16.240,00:02:18.640,"BOOK: Oh, it's a woodpecker."
00:02:18.640,00:02:20.360,A very special bird.
00:02:20.360,00:02:23.240,"Can I have a look, Daddy?"
00:02:23.240,00:02:28.880,"Ooh, the woodpecker's landed on the Great Elf Tree."
00:02:30.440,00:02:32.480,"Yes, please, Mom."
00:02:33.920,00:02:35.320,ALL: Aah!
00:02:37.400,00:02:40.840,ALL: It's an earthquake!
00:02:45.400,00:02:47.720,It's worse than an earthquake.
00:02:47.720,00:02:49.880,It's a woodpecker.
00:02:49.880,00:02:52.320,ALL: Ooh.
00:02:55.720,00:02:57.920,MR. ELF: It's made a hole.
00:03:02.640,00:03:04.800,Argh.
00:03:07.120,00:03:09.440,Phew.
00:03:13.680,00:03:15.720,Our door's stuck.
00:03:15.720,00:03:17.000,"Here, son, let me try."
00:03:20.080,00:03:23.560,I believe we have found the bird.
00:03:23.560,00:03:27.560,"Everybody, keep calm and don't panic."
00:03:29.240,00:03:30.760,Everybody out!
00:03:30.760,00:03:32.320,Run for your lives!
00:03:32.320,00:03:33.920,ALL: Aah!
00:03:35.600,00:03:37.960,"Hello, Ben."
00:03:37.960,00:03:40.840,We've got a bird in our tree.
00:03:44.000,00:03:45.600,That's correct.
00:03:49.600,00:03:52.040,"Oh, yes."
00:03:57.000,00:03:59.440,We need all the help we can get.
00:04:02.960,00:04:05.400,"Oh, thank goodness you're here, Your Majesty."
00:04:07.640,00:04:09.560,It's building a nest.
00:04:09.560,00:04:11.760,And soon there'll be eggs.
00:04:11.760,00:04:15.880,"And when they hatch, there'll be baby woodpecker chicks."
00:04:21.400,00:04:23.080,Fantastic.
00:04:23.080,00:04:26.800,"When they hatch, I can come back and tick them off in my book."
00:04:26.800,00:04:30.760,It's got to go. Now.
00:04:30.760,00:04:31.920,It can't go.
00:04:31.920,00:04:33.880,I want to spot the chicks.
00:04:33.880,00:04:38.040,"This tree is for elves, not for woodpeckers."
00:04:38.040,00:04:41.600,No nesting creature shall be disturbed.
00:04:41.600,00:04:43.280,That's the law.
00:04:43.280,00:04:47.200,Is it?
00:04:47.200,00:04:49.120,By royal command.
00:04:49.120,00:04:52.160,"Oh, it's in writing."
00:04:52.160,00:04:53.960,We'll have to obey it.
00:04:53.960,00:04:56.280,Elves never break the law.
00:04:58.480,00:05:01.560,Splendid.
00:05:01.560,00:05:04.800,Can I stay and look at the woodpecker with Ben?
00:05:04.800,00:05:08.360,"Yes, Holly. I've got more bird spotting to do."
00:05:18.480,00:05:20.480,Aah. what's this?
00:05:20.480,00:05:23.040,"It's just birdseed, Nanny."
00:05:23.040,00:05:26.200,I'm trying to attract some rare birds.
00:05:26.200,00:05:27.560,Don't sweep it up.
00:05:27.560,00:05:29.640,"Are you sure, Your Majesty?"
00:05:29.640,00:05:32.800,We don't want to attract a mouse.
00:05:34.600,00:05:37.200,"Look, Holly, eggs."
00:05:37.200,00:05:40.280,"Aah, they're hatching."
00:05:40.280,00:05:42.640,BEN: Baby birds.
00:05:47.440,00:05:50.320,"Aw, they're so sweet."
00:05:50.320,00:05:53.440,Hm. They'd be a lot sweeter if they weren't in our home.
00:05:53.440,00:05:55.840,They're going.
00:06:02.320,00:06:04.280,But they can't fly.
00:06:04.280,00:06:05.640,I can teach them.
00:06:05.640,00:06:08.440,Fairies are good at flying.
00:06:08.440,00:06:10.520,And I'm a fairy.
00:06:12.440,00:06:17.400,"Okay, baby birds, just copy me."
00:06:17.400,00:06:21.880,Flying is easy-peasy.
00:06:21.880,00:06:24.960,"Oh, they're not copying me."
00:06:24.960,00:06:28.160,Maybe we should start with something simpler.
00:06:28.160,00:06:30.000,How did you learn to fly?
00:06:30.000,00:06:33.360,I've been flying since I was a baby.
00:06:33.360,00:06:36.800,I can't remember my first flying lesson.
00:06:39.920,00:06:45.600,"Like this: Hee-hee-hee, they're copying you, Ben."
00:06:45.600,00:06:47.680,Now flap faster.
00:06:49.240,00:06:50.760,Now jump.
00:06:56.280,00:07:01.040,"You taught them to fly, even though you can't fly yourself."
00:07:03.960,00:07:06.360,"BOTH: Bye-bye, birds."
00:07:06.360,00:07:07.880,There they go.
00:07:07.880,00:07:10.040,"Goodbye, little ones."
00:07:10.040,00:07:12.600,"Oh, don't say you miss them now."
00:07:12.600,00:07:15.800,No. I've just got something in my eye.
00:07:22.800,00:07:25.040,I taught them how to fly.
00:07:32.040,00:07:33.440,But you missed them.
00:07:33.440,00:07:34.800,It's not fair.
00:07:34.800,00:07:37.680,Now I'm not going to spot anything good.
00:07:39.920,00:07:41.280,Hello?
00:07:41.280,00:07:46.160,"King Thistle, we've got a strange nest in the castle."
00:07:46.160,00:07:47.720,I'll be there straightaway.
00:07:50.200,00:07:52.160,"Nanny, where's the nest?"
00:07:52.160,00:07:55.680,"It's in the middle of my kitchen. It's a-- Don't tell me, Nanny."
00:07:55.680,00:07:58.560,I want to be the one to spot it.
00:08:02.360,00:08:04.280,It can't stay in my kitchen.
00:08:04.280,00:08:09.440,"Nanny Plum, my law says no nesting creature may be disturbed."
00:08:09.440,00:08:11.080,"But it's a ra-- Shush, Nanny."
00:08:11.080,00:08:13.400,"This is my hobby, not yours."
00:08:13.400,00:08:14.920,I'll name it.
00:08:14.920,00:08:18.760,"Whoa, it's got beady eyes."
00:08:18.760,00:08:20.360,Beady eyes?
00:08:20.360,00:08:24.600,Hm. It could be the beady-eyed blackbird.
00:08:29.840,00:08:31.960,Whiskers? Ah.
00:08:37.680,00:08:40.520,A scaly tail?
00:08:40.520,00:08:43.880,"This bird is so rare, I don't even know it."
00:08:43.880,00:08:45.720,I've discovered a new bird.
00:08:45.720,00:08:50.960,It shall be named the King Thistle Bird.
00:08:50.960,00:08:52.880,"If you say so, Your Majesty."
00:08:52.880,00:08:56.640,"But I don't want that filthy, smelly rodent in my kitchen."
00:08:56.640,00:09:01.280,"Nanny Plum, that's no way to talk about the King Thistle Bird."
00:09:01.280,00:09:03.840,We must let it lay its eggs in peace.
00:09:03.840,00:09:07.240,I don't think rats lay eggs.
00:09:08.360,00:09:10.160,ALL: Aah! A rat!
00:09:13.520,00:09:16.640,"Yes. Shoo, shoo. Get out of here, you filthy rat."
00:09:19.640,00:09:23.760,The King Thistle Bird must be allowed to stay.
00:09:23.760,00:09:26.200,What?
00:09:23.760,00:09:29.560,"Your law says, no nesting animal may be disturbed."
00:09:29.560,00:09:31.040,Did I say that?
00:09:31.040,00:09:32.640,"Yes, Daddy."
00:09:32.640,00:09:36.320,"Well, um, maybe the law should say, um, uh..."
00:09:36.320,00:09:38.200,Let me see this law.
00:09:38.200,00:09:40.560,"You see, it's in writing."
00:09:40.560,00:09:42.880,There's nothing we can do about it.
00:09:48.560,00:09:51.640,"Now, get this rat out of my castle."
00:09:51.640,00:09:54.240,"Um, Nanny Plum, you speak rat."
00:09:56.080,00:09:58.720,"Now, what's rat for please leave?"
00:10:00.280,00:10:02.600,Get out of my kitchen!
00:10:06.160,00:10:08.760,You've hurt a rat's feelings.
00:10:19.600,00:10:21.760,"Daddy, it's brilliant."
00:10:25.320,00:10:28.120,Now you can tick them off in your book.
00:10:28.120,00:10:30.960,"Ah, yes. Lovely."
00:10:30.960,00:10:36.360,"Honestly, darling, why do you have to have such a noisy hobby?"
00:10:39.640,00:10:45.560,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the Little Castle.
00:10:49.160,00:10:51.200,"DAISY &amp; POPPY: Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up."
00:10:52.520,00:10:54.960,"BOTH: Giddy up, giddy up."
00:10:52.520,00:10:59.400,"Daisy, Poppy, don't ride your hobby horses on the breakfast table."
00:11:03.280,00:11:04.480,Hm.
00:11:06.600,00:11:09.240,And ponies are lovely pets.
00:11:11.040,00:11:14.720,"And they've got long, swishy tails to brush."
00:11:19.560,00:11:21.240,"Goodness me, no."
00:11:21.240,00:11:23.320,Ponies are ginormous.
00:11:23.320,00:11:26.520,And Daisy and Poppy are tiny fairies.
00:11:31.720,00:11:34.320,Maybe the princesses could have another sort of pet.
00:11:34.320,00:11:36.120,"BOTH: Pet, pet, pet."
00:11:36.120,00:11:39.160,"I can magic them up a harmless, fluffy little pet."
00:11:44.840,00:11:45.960,The twins can.
00:11:45.960,00:11:48.240,BOTH: We will. We promise.
00:11:48.240,00:11:49.720,Okay.
00:11:49.720,00:11:52.560,"But please make it a sensible pet, Nanny."
00:11:52.560,00:11:56.000,Not a dragon or a dinosaur.
00:11:57.240,00:11:59.960,I've got a bad feeling about this.
00:12:01.560,00:12:04.440,Nanny Plum knows what she's doing.
00:12:07.960,00:12:12.680,"Here we are, The Magical Fairy Library."
00:12:12.680,00:12:16.480,"Now, let's find a book on pets."
00:12:20.400,00:12:22.080,"BOTH: Tiger, tiger."
00:12:22.080,00:12:23.840,No. Too big.
00:12:23.840,00:12:26.640,BOTH: Oh. Tiger.
00:12:28.400,00:12:30.920,"BOTH: Snakey, snakey."
00:12:30.920,00:12:32.040,No. Too wiggly.
00:12:32.040,00:12:34.560,BOTH: Oh. Wiggly snakey.
00:12:34.560,00:12:36.320,An alligator?
00:12:36.320,00:12:38.800,BOTH: Alligator. Alligator.
00:12:40.400,00:12:42.480,BOTH: Oh. Alligator.
00:12:42.480,00:12:44.440,Ah. Here we go.
00:12:44.440,00:12:45.800,The perfect little pet.
00:12:45.800,00:12:47.400,A hamster.
00:12:47.400,00:12:49.160,BOTH: Hamster. Hamster.
00:12:53.640,00:12:57.720,I wonder what pet Nanny has magicked up for Daisy and Poppy.
00:12:57.720,00:13:00.360,"As long as it's small, I don't care."
00:13:00.360,00:13:05.040,Ahem. May I present the princesses' new pet. Pippin.
00:13:09.160,00:13:11.600,Aah! A rat.
00:13:11.600,00:13:12.880,"No, Your Majesty."
00:13:12.880,00:13:15.520,Pippin is a lovely little hamster.
00:13:15.520,00:13:17.560,How sweet.
00:13:21.840,00:13:23.760,"Pippin likes you, Daddy."
00:13:28.080,00:13:30.760,Cute isn't quite the word I had in mind.
00:13:30.760,00:13:35.440,"I think it'd be, um, happier if it lived outside."
00:13:41.640,00:13:43.280,"Back, Pippin."
00:13:46.240,00:13:47.680,"There, Pippin."
00:13:51.520,00:13:54.280,I hope Pippin won't be bored living here.
00:13:54.280,00:13:56.160,We'll give Pippin some toys.
00:13:56.160,00:13:59.960,And hamsters like lots of straw.
00:14:01.920,00:14:04.920,"Can we give Pippin something to eat, Nanny?"
00:14:04.920,00:14:06.800,"BOTH: Foody, foody."
00:14:06.800,00:14:10.200,Yes. And a drink.
00:14:11.680,00:14:15.160,Aw. That should make Pippin feel at home.
00:14:24.200,00:14:26.400,"It's for your hamster, Your Majesty."
00:14:26.400,00:14:28.000,My hamster?
00:14:28.000,00:14:30.320,Ha-ha-ha. It's funny.
00:14:35.840,00:14:38.760,Why does it have to run about so much?
00:14:38.760,00:14:41.040,Hamsters like running about.
00:14:42.280,00:14:45.520,"Hi, Ben. Hi, Gaston."
00:14:49.960,00:14:52.680,"Oh. Um, how sad."
00:14:55.120,00:14:56.840,BOTH: Pippin. Pippin.
00:14:56.840,00:14:59.280,We've lost Pippin.
00:15:01.440,00:15:04.200,Pippin's gone. Gone forever.
00:15:04.200,00:15:07.920,"Wait, King Thistle, I can get your hamster back."
00:15:07.920,00:15:09.920,"Uh, don't trouble yourself, Ben."
00:15:09.920,00:15:11.240,It's no trouble.
00:15:11.240,00:15:13.760,Elves are good at rounding up hamsters.
00:15:13.760,00:15:16.400,And I'm an elf.
00:15:16.400,00:15:17.560,"Ready, Gaston?"
00:15:24.560,00:15:26.120,Oof.
00:15:29.880,00:15:31.520,"Uh, thank you, Ben."
00:15:39.160,00:15:41.440,Does it ever go to sleep?
00:15:41.440,00:15:43.480,"Uh, maybe when it's tired."
00:15:43.480,00:15:45.800,And how do we make it tired?
00:15:45.800,00:15:48.120,Let's ask the Wise Old Elf.
00:15:48.120,00:15:50.760,He knows everything.
00:16:00.040,00:16:01.440,Hamster?
00:16:06.640,00:16:08.000,"Ah, I see."
00:16:08.000,00:16:10.720,What you need is a wheel.
00:16:10.720,00:16:13.160,A wheel? How will that help?
00:16:13.160,00:16:14.440,Wait and see.
00:16:14.440,00:16:17.080,I'll be right over.
00:16:24.480,00:16:27.080,"Hello, King Thistle."
00:16:27.080,00:16:29.560,Where's this hamster of yours?
00:16:30.840,00:16:33.280,Here's Pippin.
00:16:37.480,00:16:40.400,"Oh, charmed, I'm sure."
00:16:40.400,00:16:43.280,Bring in the wheel.
00:16:43.280,00:16:44.560,Right-ho.
00:16:50.440,00:16:52.280,It's hideous.
00:16:52.280,00:16:56.200,"The things we do for our pets, eh, King Thistle?"
00:16:58.200,00:17:02.440,Lower the wheel into the hamster cage.
00:17:03.600,00:17:05.920,Are you talking about my castle?
00:17:05.920,00:17:10.280,"Put the wheel in the middle of the hamster cage, Mr. Elf."
00:17:13.040,00:17:15.200,Pippin.
00:17:15.200,00:17:16.760,"Here, Pippin."
00:17:22.200,00:17:24.840,Are you sure the wheel is strong enough?
00:17:24.840,00:17:26.320,It'll be fine.
00:17:26.320,00:17:29.000,Hamsters don't run very fast.
00:17:31.040,00:17:34.520,"Ooh. You've got a fast hamster, haven't you?"
00:17:36.320,00:17:39.320,The wheel is spinning too quickly.
00:17:48.040,00:17:49.400,My castle.
00:17:49.400,00:17:52.320,"Oh, dear."
00:17:52.320,00:17:56.800,The wheel's heading for the Great Elf Tree.
00:17:56.800,00:17:59.560,We'll have to warn the elves.
00:18:03.080,00:18:04.320,Hello.
00:18:04.320,00:18:05.600,"MR. ELF: Hello, dear, it's me."
00:18:05.600,00:18:08.360,"Um, do you know what hamsters are?"
00:18:08.360,00:18:11.560,"Yes, dear, they're sweet, little fluffy creatures."
00:18:11.560,00:18:12.960,"Um, yes."
00:18:12.960,00:18:18.880,"Well, don't panic, but there's a hamster coming your way in an enormous wheel!"
00:18:18.880,00:18:20.160,Oh.
00:18:21.760,00:18:24.520,ALL: Aah!
00:18:28.880,00:18:31.840,It's heading back to the Little Castle.
00:18:31.840,00:18:33.280,ALL: Oh.
00:18:33.280,00:18:42.040,"Oh, my goodness, Mr. Elf, we were spared, but the mighty wheel's thundering back from whence it came and-- Ahem."
00:18:46.960,00:18:48.920,ALL: Hooray!
00:18:48.920,00:18:50.800,What's the bad news?
00:18:50.800,00:18:53.960,The wheel is coming back here!
00:18:53.960,00:18:55.720,ALL: Aah!
00:19:00.040,00:19:01.560,Run for your lives!
00:19:06.400,00:19:09.200,ALL: Aah!
00:19:09.200,00:19:12.320,I can't believe it.
00:19:12.320,00:19:13.800,"Yes, King Thistle."
00:19:13.800,00:19:15.680,"Wonderful, isn't it?"
00:19:22.160,00:19:25.080,Oh. Pippin's tired.
00:19:25.080,00:19:28.080,You see?
00:19:28.080,00:19:31.560,Now we know how much exercise Pippin needs every day.
00:19:31.560,00:19:33.080,To the Elf Tree and back.
00:19:33.080,00:19:36.320,No. Pippin has to go.
00:19:36.320,00:19:37.520,BOTH: Oh.
00:19:37.520,00:19:40.080,But Daisy and Poppy love Pippin.
00:19:40.080,00:19:41.440,BOTH: Pippin.
00:19:41.440,00:19:45.520,I don't want a pet living in my castle.
00:19:45.520,00:19:48.240,I could magic Pippin into a different kind of pet.
00:19:48.240,00:19:50.760,A pet that could live outside the castle.
00:19:50.760,00:19:54.760,"Okay, Nanny. Just do it."
00:20:01.800,00:20:04.720,"I mean, the castle, Your Majesty."
00:20:04.720,00:20:06.680,Splendid. Let's take a look.
00:20:07.680,00:20:09.080,What?
00:20:09.080,00:20:10.720,Nanny!
00:20:10.720,00:20:12.360,"Yes, Your Majesty?"
00:20:12.360,00:20:16.320,Why is there straw in my courtyard?
00:20:16.320,00:20:17.520,Courtyard?
00:20:17.520,00:20:19.920,"Oh, you mean the feeding bowl."
00:20:19.920,00:20:21.840,What?
00:20:34.160,00:20:36.120,DAISY &amp; POPPY: Pippin pony.
00:20:37.280,00:20:38.600,"BOTH: Giddy up, giddy up."
00:00:10.200,00:00:15.280,"Everyone who lives here is very, very small."
00:00:15.280,00:00:16.560,I'm Ben Elf.
00:00:36.440,00:00:42.560,Today's adventures starts at the little castle.
00:00:46.040,00:00:48.640,"Holly, Violet and Strawberry."
00:00:48.640,00:00:51.480,Are you ready for today's fairy lesson?
00:00:54.840,00:00:59.560,Today's lesson is about-- Who can that be?
00:01:00.800,00:01:02.640,"Ah, Ben Elf."
00:01:02.640,00:01:03.960,"Hello, Nanny Plum."
00:01:05.320,00:01:11.400,I'm afraid Princess Holly is too busy to play with elves or insects.
00:01:12.880,00:01:15.040,"Hi, Ben."
00:01:18.440,00:01:19.920,Do you want to join in?
00:01:19.920,00:01:21.200,"Yes, please."
00:01:24.280,00:01:27.560,"Please, Nanny, let Ben stay."
00:01:27.560,00:01:32.400,"But Ben's missed the beginning, and I don't want to repeat everything I've said."
00:01:42.400,00:01:43.760,Okay.
00:01:54.200,00:01:57.080,"Oh, so you're joining us too, are you?"
00:02:00.000,00:02:02.400,"Now, where was I?"
00:02:03.560,00:02:05.800,Today's lesson is about...
00:02:05.800,00:02:07.480,"Thank you, Strawberry."
00:02:12.680,00:02:14.680,ALL: Ooh!
00:02:17.280,00:02:21.640,"Hair lovely, clothes stylish."
00:02:21.640,00:02:23.800,Skin beautifully clean.
00:02:25.280,00:02:29.280,"NANNY: Elves and ladybirds, of course, need not worry about such things."
00:02:29.280,00:02:34.720,"Rule two, fairies should never ever be without their wands."
00:02:36.120,00:02:37.640,Who knows why?
00:02:45.280,00:02:48.240,A fairy without her wand is like a...
00:02:48.240,00:02:50.880,Like a ladybird without her spots.
00:02:52.320,00:02:56.000,"Nanny, Gaston's a boy ladybird."
00:02:56.000,00:02:57.240,Whatever.
00:03:01.200,00:03:03.480,"ALL: Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:03:10.720,00:03:14.440,As long as I fly low I'll be fine.
00:03:14.440,00:03:18.840,"But on a day like today, no one should fly above the castle walls."
00:03:18.840,00:03:20.920,It's very windy up here.
00:03:20.920,00:03:23.040,"ALL: Yes, Nanny Plum."
00:03:23.040,00:03:25.680,"So, what have we learned?"
00:03:25.680,00:03:29.040,Fairies should always look nice.
00:03:29.040,00:03:33.880,Fairies must never ever be without their wands.
00:03:35.200,00:03:38.360,Fairies mustn't fly in strong winds.
00:03:38.360,00:03:40.120,Very good.
00:03:50.040,00:03:51.680,Was that meant to happen?
00:03:51.680,00:03:53.600,I don't think so.
00:03:59.760,00:04:06.040,And a fairy without a wand-- Is like a ladybird without his spots.
00:04:06.040,00:04:07.600,Poor Nanny.
00:04:07.600,00:04:09.280,What can we do?
00:04:09.280,00:04:11.080,I've got a simple plan.
00:04:11.080,00:04:16.960,"We find Nanny, we rescue her, then we give Nanny her wand."
00:04:16.960,00:04:19.160,But we don't know how to find her.
00:04:19.160,00:04:21.720,And we don't know how to rescue her.
00:04:21.720,00:04:26.280,And we're not allowed to touch Nanny Plum's wand.
00:04:26.280,00:04:27.920,Then it's a good thing I'm here.
00:04:27.920,00:04:31.560,I can do all those things because I'm an elf.
00:04:34.480,00:04:37.040,"Gaston, find Nanny Plum."
00:04:48.280,00:04:50.560,BEN: There's Nanny Plum!
00:04:50.560,00:04:53.160,Stage one completed.
00:04:53.160,00:04:54.640,Hello!
00:05:00.640,00:05:02.480,My smell?
00:05:02.480,00:05:06.200,"For your information, I do not smell."
00:05:06.200,00:05:10.160,"Nanny, we've got your wand!"
00:05:10.160,00:05:11.680,Holly!
00:05:11.680,00:05:14.480,You know you're not allowed to touch my wand.
00:05:14.480,00:05:16.920,It could be very dangerous.
00:05:20.000,00:05:24.560,And you said a fairy should never be without her wand.
00:05:24.560,00:05:29.240,So we're here to rescue you and give you back your wand!
00:05:38.120,00:05:41.840,I'm going to throw this lasso round your waist.
00:05:41.840,00:05:44.720,Uh... That sounds dangerous.
00:05:49.720,00:05:53.280,"Are you sure you don't want to be rescued, Nanny?"
00:05:53.280,00:05:54.680,NANNY: Quite sure.
00:05:54.680,00:06:01.880,"This isn't quite what I had planned, but now we're all together again, let's resume the lesson."
00:06:08.400,00:06:09.840,My weight?
00:06:15.200,00:06:27.360,"The last thing you said was, Even I find it difficult to fly when the wind is so-- That's the sound you made when the wind blew you away."
00:06:29.240,00:06:31.120,"Ah, yes."
00:06:31.120,00:06:32.520,"Thank you, Strawberry."
00:06:32.520,00:06:42.760,"Even I find it difficult to-- Nanny, are you okay?"
00:06:42.760,00:06:44.240,"Uh, yes."
00:06:44.240,00:06:45.960,At least I'm dry.
00:06:45.960,00:06:48.000,Whoops!
00:06:51.520,00:06:53.280,Nanny's wings are soaking wet.
00:06:53.280,00:06:55.880,HOLLY: She can't fly.
00:06:55.880,00:06:58.800,STRAWBERRY: So she's stuck on that little island.
00:07:02.480,00:07:03.720,"Uh, no."
00:07:03.720,00:07:07.720,"I'll wait for my wings to dry, and then I'll fly over to you."
00:07:09.520,00:07:12.680,BEN: I think that bird's looking for worms.
00:07:13.960,00:07:18.240,I hope Mrs. Bird doesn't mistake me for a worm.
00:07:23.760,00:07:27.080,"Oh, Nanny Plum's in a bird's nest."
00:07:27.080,00:07:30.920,"I'll be all right, as long as the eggs don't hatch."
00:07:38.960,00:07:42.280,"Oh, bother!"
00:07:46.800,00:07:50.280,"It's not pleasant, but it's only mud."
00:07:50.280,00:07:53.000,BEN: I think it's quicksand.
00:07:53.000,00:07:56.480,Nanny Plum is sinking into the ground.
00:07:58.680,00:08:00.800,I'm ready to be rescued now.
00:08:02.760,00:08:04.840,"Giddyap, Gaston!"
00:08:04.840,00:08:06.360,Giddyap! Giddyap!
00:08:06.360,00:08:08.280,"Keep still, Nanny Plum."
00:08:14.360,00:08:15.680,She's too heavy!
00:08:15.680,00:08:18.240,"Gaston, pull harder!"
00:08:19.480,00:08:20.800,Whoo!
00:08:20.800,00:08:22.800,ALL: Hooray!
00:08:22.800,00:08:24.640,"Ugh, Nanny Plum."
00:08:24.640,00:08:26.880,You smell horrible.
00:08:26.880,00:08:30.160,"Well, at least no one else was here to see all that."
00:08:34.360,00:08:35.440,My goodness.
00:08:35.440,00:08:37.600,"Is that you, Nanny Plum?"
00:08:37.600,00:08:40.440,"Uh... Yes, Queen Thistle."
00:08:40.440,00:08:43.720,I'm just teaching the children a few fairy rules.
00:08:43.720,00:08:44.880,Excellent.
00:08:44.880,00:08:47.320,And what fairy rules are you teaching?
00:08:47.320,00:08:51.920,"Rule one, fairies must always look nice."
00:08:57.160,00:08:58.960,Uh... Yes.
00:08:58.960,00:09:03.160,I've been showing the children what not to do.
00:09:03.160,00:09:08.120,"Rule two, fairies must never ever be without their wands."
00:09:08.120,00:09:10.280,"Uh, yes, yes, Strawberry."
00:09:10.280,00:09:13.120,King Thistle doesn't want to know all the little details.
00:09:13.120,00:09:16.880,"You seem to have everything under control, Nanny Plum."
00:09:16.880,00:09:18.080,Please carry on.
00:09:18.080,00:09:20.240,"Thank you, Your Royalness."
00:09:23.240,00:09:26.600,Did you notice that Nanny Plum seemed a bit smelly?
00:09:26.600,00:09:29.920,I thought it was the ladybird.
00:09:29.920,00:09:31.840,"Now, where was I?"
00:09:31.840,00:09:35.880,"You had just shouted, Whoa! Oof!"
00:09:35.880,00:09:38.960,That's the sound you made as you landed in the mud.
00:09:38.960,00:09:40.200,Oof!
00:09:40.200,00:09:42.040,"Thank you, Strawberry."
00:09:42.040,00:09:45.720,Actually that brings today's lesson to a close.
00:09:51.640,00:09:53.960,"I'm pleased you enjoyed it, Ben."
00:09:53.960,00:09:56.640,And thank you for rescuing me.
00:09:56.640,00:09:59.600,"Ah, it's nice to have you back."
00:10:00.800,00:10:11.360,"Hair be lovely Clothes have style Skin beautifully clean Nanny Plum, you look lovely and pretty again."
00:10:11.360,00:10:13.320,"Thank you, Strawberry."
00:10:13.320,00:10:17.000,"Now, children, what do you think I've learned today?"
00:10:17.000,00:10:21.520,Um... What to shout when you fall out of trees and stuff?
00:10:32.040,00:10:34.400,"NANNY: Oh, yes. Sorry, Gaston."
00:10:34.400,00:10:36.080,Or ladybirds.
00:10:38.560,00:10:44.600,NARRATOR: Today's adventure starts at the little castle.
00:10:50.320,00:10:56.280,QUEEN: And then the witch locked the fairy and all the elves in a big cage.
00:10:56.280,00:10:59.680,"'Help! Help,' they shouted."
00:10:59.680,00:11:00.920,"'Hee, hee."
00:11:03.720,00:11:04.840,"Oh, no."
00:11:07.160,00:11:10.600,"Because the witch was very naughty, and the children were annoying her."
00:11:10.600,00:11:12.440,KIDS: Ah.
00:11:12.440,00:11:18.680,"All the chasing around had made the witch hungry, so she ate a moldy old cake."
00:11:18.680,00:11:20.720,"Chomp, chomp, chomp."
00:11:24.200,00:11:25.560,That's what witches eat.
00:11:28.520,00:11:29.720,"Glug, glug, glug."
00:11:31.560,00:11:34.480,"QUEEN: After that, she fell asleep."
00:11:36.920,00:11:39.080,"'She's asleep,' said the fairy."
00:11:39.080,00:11:47.320,"'Quick, let's escape.' So the elves broke open the cage door, and the fairy princess got her wand back."
00:11:47.320,00:11:49.240,ALL: Ooh!
00:11:49.240,00:11:52.320,"Then, the witch woke up."
00:11:52.320,00:11:59.560,"QUEEN: 'Get back in your cage,' cried the witch, but the fairy was already casting her spell."
00:12:12.320,00:12:13.480,The end.
00:12:13.480,00:12:15.200,KIDS: Hooray!
00:12:17.680,00:12:24.120,"Um... The witch was told off for being mean and nasty, and made to wash dishes for the rest of her life."
00:12:24.120,00:12:25.680,KIDS: Ooh!
00:12:25.680,00:12:28.080,"Horrible things, witches."
00:12:28.080,00:12:31.360,"It's a good job they don't really exist, isn't it?"
00:12:31.360,00:12:33.560,"Oh, but they do exist."
00:12:35.360,00:12:36.800,Really?
00:12:38.000,00:12:39.840,I can take you to see her if you like.
00:12:39.840,00:12:42.680,But won't she lock us up in a big cage?
00:12:42.680,00:12:44.520,"Ha, ha. No."
00:12:44.520,00:12:50.640,"Witches can sometimes be a bit naughty, but only when they get very annoyed."
00:12:50.640,00:12:55.200,"Mommy, do you think we should go and see the witch?"
00:12:56.760,00:12:58.400,Nanny Plum will protect you.
00:12:58.400,00:13:01.920,Then you can see for yourselves how disgusting witches are.
00:13:04.480,00:13:06.040,KING: Bye!
00:13:14.200,00:13:15.560,Are they scary?
00:13:15.560,00:13:17.800,Not that scary.
00:13:17.800,00:13:19.720,But witches are a bit smelly.
00:13:19.720,00:13:21.240,BEN &amp; HOLLY: Ooh!
00:13:27.000,00:13:29.560,Witches hardly ever do magic.
00:13:29.560,00:13:32.320,"And they're not that good at magic, anyway."
00:13:34.920,00:13:36.600,Here we are.
00:13:41.240,00:13:42.680,BOTH: Ooh!
00:13:42.680,00:13:45.000,"Knock, knock!"
00:13:45.000,00:13:46.360,WOMAN: Who's there?
00:13:46.360,00:13:47.840,Nanny.
00:13:47.840,00:13:49.240,Nanny who?
00:13:49.240,00:13:52.520,Nanny Plum.
00:13:52.520,00:13:54.840,"Oh, Nanny Plum."
00:13:54.840,00:13:57.000,Do come in.
00:13:59.640,00:14:02.480,A real fairy and an elf.
00:14:02.480,00:14:03.640,Yes.
00:14:03.640,00:14:07.360,This is Princess Holly and Ben Elf.
00:14:07.360,00:14:12.440,Come closer so that I can get a better look at you.
00:14:15.080,00:14:17.520,See?
00:14:17.520,00:14:19.360,Just a bit smelly.
00:14:19.360,00:14:20.760,What's that?
00:14:20.760,00:14:23.280,"NANNY: Don't touch anything, children."
00:14:23.280,00:14:25.120,Why can't we touch?
00:14:25.120,00:14:26.840,Because it's dirty.
00:14:26.840,00:14:28.160,What's that?
00:14:28.160,00:14:30.120,"Don't worry, dear!"
00:14:30.120,00:14:34.760,I just wanted to show the children how a real witch lives.
00:14:34.760,00:14:37.280,"Oh, I see."
00:14:48.040,00:14:52.240,Can we ask you some questions about being a witch?
00:14:55.040,00:14:57.640,Are you any good at magic?
00:14:57.640,00:15:03.040,"Well, I don't like to use magic these days because-- I told you."
00:15:03.040,00:15:06.960,"Witches are no good at magic, and they never use it anyway."
00:15:06.960,00:15:08.400,What's that?
00:15:08.400,00:15:15.160,"Mrs. Witch, if you don't do magic these days, then what do you do?"
00:15:15.160,00:15:16.720,I'm retired.
00:15:21.800,00:15:27.000,"No, I just-- Look, witches don't do anything."
00:15:27.000,00:15:30.400,They just smell a bit funny and make horrible cakes.
00:15:37.960,00:15:39.480,"Yes, I can."
00:15:39.480,00:15:42.600,Then why don't you change this horrible wallpaper?
00:15:43.840,00:15:46.680,That's-- Or make these seats more comfortable?
00:15:47.920,00:15:49.760,"Stop it, Nanny."
00:15:49.760,00:15:52.600,You could make tasty cakes.
00:15:52.600,00:15:54.280,I'm warning you.
00:15:54.280,00:15:57.080,Or get some new clothes.
00:16:15.840,00:16:19.320,"Maybe not, but she was."
00:16:22.440,00:16:25.560,Are you going to keep Nanny frozen forever?
00:16:25.560,00:16:27.000,No.
00:16:27.000,00:16:30.760,If Nanny says sorry she can go.
00:16:34.680,00:16:37.120,I will not say sorry.
00:16:37.120,00:16:42.080,"I was only trying to help you out, you grumpy old witch."
00:16:42.080,00:16:44.800,So you won't let Nanny go?
00:16:44.800,00:16:46.080,Nope.
00:16:46.080,00:16:48.400,We should get help.
00:16:49.640,00:16:52.640,"Is it all right if we go, Mrs. Witch?"
00:16:54.440,00:16:58.800,You have both been delightful company.
00:16:58.800,00:17:00.840,What's you plan?
00:17:06.240,00:17:08.120,Then she'll let Nanny go.
00:17:09.800,00:17:11.480,"Uh, bye!"
00:17:11.480,00:17:13.920,Thank you very much for having us.
00:17:17.360,00:17:18.640,Bye-bye.
00:17:19.800,00:17:21.240,Quick! Run!
00:17:31.200,00:17:33.520,HOLLY: Daddy! Daddy!
00:17:33.520,00:17:37.520,Nanny Plum made Mrs. Witch really angry.
00:17:37.520,00:17:40.680,And now Nanny's frozen like a statue!
00:17:40.680,00:17:43.000,"Oh, dear."
00:17:43.000,00:17:47.800,"If we don't do something, then Nanny will stay frozen forever."
00:17:47.800,00:17:49.080,Hm...
00:17:49.080,00:17:51.080,We'll never see Nanny again.
00:17:51.080,00:17:52.400,How sad.
00:17:52.400,00:17:55.840,And there'll be no more lovely dinners.
00:17:57.920,00:18:00.800,"Nanny Plum, frozen?"
00:18:00.800,00:18:03.800,Show me where Mrs. Witch lives.
00:18:07.640,00:18:10.080,Was Nanny Plum rude to Mrs. Witch?
00:18:10.080,00:18:11.240,A bit.
00:18:11.240,00:18:14.600,Hm...
00:18:14.600,00:18:17.760,"Are you going to tell Mrs. Witch off, Daddy?"
00:18:17.760,00:18:20.520,No. I've got a better idea.
00:18:26.760,00:18:28.280,King Thistle.
00:18:28.280,00:18:30.040,King Thistle who?
00:18:30.040,00:18:31.800,Uh...
00:18:31.800,00:18:35.800,"King Thistle, King Thistle."
00:18:38.120,00:18:41.960,You must be the Mrs. Witch I have heard so much about.
00:18:47.800,00:18:49.440,Oh.
00:18:49.440,00:18:52.480,Not to mention your wonderful cooking.
00:18:52.480,00:18:54.240,Would you like a worm cake?
00:18:54.240,00:18:55.520,"No, thank you."
00:18:55.520,00:18:59.040,I believe you may have frozen Nanny Plum.
00:18:59.040,00:19:06.080,"Yes, I have, but-- I completely understand why you would want to do this."
00:19:06.080,00:19:07.760,You do?
00:19:07.760,00:19:12.920,"Nanny Plum can be quite rude at times, but she's really not that clever."
00:19:12.920,00:19:14.360,"Yes, well..."
00:19:14.360,00:19:23.800,"I am sure, being as clever and as kind as you are, and knowing that Nanny really can't help herself, you will let her go this time."
00:19:25.760,00:19:30.000,"Quite apart from that, I need Nanny to cook my dinner."
00:19:32.200,00:19:34.280,That's very kind of you.
00:19:34.280,00:19:37.080,I was just about to boil some toads in the hole.
00:19:37.080,00:19:40.360,But I just need Nanny Plum back.
00:19:40.360,00:19:42.320,I understand.
00:19:50.920,00:19:53.240,"Say Thank you for having me, Nanny."
00:19:55.320,00:19:59.040,"Goodbye, Mrs. Witch, and very nice to meet you."
00:19:59.040,00:20:01.880,"I'm honored, Your Majesty."
00:20:01.880,00:20:03.080,Bye-bye.
00:20:03.080,00:20:05.280,ALL: Bye-bye!
00:20:06.720,00:20:11.360,"Daddy, you didn't tell Mrs. Witch off at all."
00:20:11.360,00:20:16.920,"And you said Mrs. Witch was beautiful, when she's ugly and smelly."
00:20:16.920,00:20:24.280,"Well, Ben, there's a time for telling someone they're ugly and smelly, and a time to be just...nice."
00:20:25.480,00:20:30.040,Saying nice things about people always goes a long way.
00:20:30.040,00:20:32.720,"It's good to have you back, Nanny Plum."
00:20:32.720,00:20:34.280,"Thank you, Holly."
00:20:34.280,00:20:35.720,Yes.
00:20:35.720,00:20:37.800,What's for supper?
00:20:37.800,00:20:40.040,Oh.
