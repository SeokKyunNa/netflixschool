00:00:34.951,00:00:36.411,I saw a m-- m-- monkey!
00:00:36.494,00:00:37.579,Tool belt!
00:00:47.380,00:00:49.466,Monkey with a tool belt.
00:01:11.279,00:01:14.032,"Clark, the pinata's over here."
00:01:14.115,00:01:15.158,"Come on, birthday boy."
00:01:15.241,00:01:16.117,Ooh!
00:01:19.370,00:01:21.081,I got it! I got it!
00:01:21.164,00:01:23.208,"Ooh, peanuts!"
00:01:23.708,00:01:26.419,"Ooh, this is the best birthday..."
00:01:27.921,00:01:29.297,ever!
00:01:30.048,00:01:32.717,"Well, it's about to get even better!"
00:01:32.801,00:01:33.635,Tiny...
00:01:36.471,00:01:46.648,"Neil Ostrich reporting live from the top of Blunderburg Tower, where the piano man Elkin John will soon play a concert for his dear fans."
00:01:46.731,00:01:52.362,Elkin John! I love Elkin John! He's my favorite singer of all time!
00:01:52.445,00:01:54.197,"Well, what do you say, Clark?"
00:01:54.280,00:01:59.244,Want to go see Elkin John perform live at the very top of Blunderburg Tower?
00:01:59.327,00:02:01.121,Of course I do!
00:02:01.204,00:02:03.248,But... Blunderburg Tower?
00:02:06.417,00:02:09.295,What? I thought he was scared of low places.
00:02:09.379,00:02:13.258,"I'm actually kind of scared of all places, but especially high places!"
00:02:13.341,00:02:16.970,"Oh, I could never go to the top of Blunderburg Tower."
00:02:17.053,00:02:21.057,"Aw, that's okay, Clark. We can just watch the concert on TV."
00:02:22.600,00:02:23.726,The banana phone!
00:02:31.359,00:02:34.946,Chico Bon Bon! You got a problem? We can solve ‘em!
00:02:35.446,00:02:38.700,"Hello, hello there, I'm Sir Elkin John."
00:02:43.079,00:02:47.375,My show's about to begin and I've got a major piano problem.
00:02:50.587,00:02:53.756,"Sir Elkin, you've reached the right monkey business."
00:02:53.840,00:02:56.509,There's no piano problem we can't solve.
00:02:56.593,00:02:59.637,"Fix-It Force, time to bring the awesome!"
00:03:02.682,00:03:04.642,Rainbow Thunder!
00:03:05.226,00:03:06.436,Clark!
00:03:07.020,00:03:08.146,Tiny!
00:03:17.822,00:03:19.032,Whoa!
00:03:42.847,00:03:46.351,"Wow, look at all the fans here to see Elkin!"
00:03:46.434,00:03:49.103,That's gotta be the longest velvet rope I've ever seen.
00:03:53.858,00:03:56.819,"I'm Chico Bon Bon, monkey with a tool belt."
00:03:56.903,00:03:59.280,And we're the Fix-It Force.
00:04:02.200,00:04:03.868,Elkin John!
00:04:05.662,00:04:09.874,"Oh, I'm Clark, your number one biggest fan!"
00:04:09.958,00:04:12.335,"Love the entrance, gang!"
00:04:12.418,00:04:14.170,And you're just in time.
00:04:14.254,00:04:18.591,I need to get my precious piano to the top of the tower for the show.
00:04:18.675,00:04:21.135,But it won't fit in the elevator.
00:04:29.894,00:04:34.023,"Fix-It Force, we've got to find a way to get this up there."
00:04:34.107,00:04:37.568,Whip out your umbrellas. It's time for a brainstorm.
00:04:37.652,00:04:39.237,"Okay, what have we got, people?"
00:04:39.320,00:04:40.697,-Rockets. -Go on.
00:04:40.780,00:04:41.948,Rockets go fast.
00:04:42.031,00:04:43.992,-Yes. -Rockets go high.
00:04:44.075,00:04:45.535,"Ooh, tell me more."
00:04:48.121,00:04:52.166,"We attach the piano to a rainbow rocket and ka-pow, blast it up!"
00:04:52.250,00:04:53.626,Ha! Love it!
00:05:00.591,00:05:02.343,Pow pow meow!
00:05:05.555,00:05:07.307,It's working!
00:05:07.724,00:05:09.600,Whoa!
00:05:13.354,00:05:15.148,-It's not working. -On it.
00:05:18.484,00:05:19.485,Phew!
00:05:19.569,00:05:23.781,Hmm. Perhaps this calls for a more gentle approach.
00:05:34.709,00:05:37.462,I think I know just what we need.
00:05:43.343,00:05:45.970,All we have to do is push the piano up!
00:06:00.234,00:06:02.445,Oh! It's too steep!
00:06:02.528,00:06:09.994,"With no way to get Elkin's piano to the top of Blunderberg Tower, will the concert have to be canceled?"
00:06:10.620,00:06:12.914,No!
00:06:14.332,00:06:17.502,"Don't worry, Sir Elkin, sir. We'll think of something."
00:06:17.585,00:06:19.962,"-Won't we? -Chico, what do we do now?"
00:06:20.463,00:06:27.762,"Well, we-- Maybe we could, uh, uh-- Maybe it's time for a banana break."
00:06:41.609,00:06:43.778,But maybe we can pull it.
00:06:48.533,00:06:50.576,"Blazing bananas, that's it!"
00:06:50.660,00:06:53.204,We can pull the piano to the top!
00:06:53.287,00:06:54.997,How are we going to do that?
00:06:55.081,00:06:57.250,With the wheel thingy!
00:06:57.667,00:07:03.714,"Uh, it's called a pulley, Chico, and it's a great tool for pulling heavy things up."
00:07:03.798,00:07:06.801,-Like my pinata! -Or Elkin's piano.
00:07:06.884,00:07:09.220,"Oh, a piano pulley."
00:07:11.764,00:07:19.063,"Hmm. Now, to engineer it, we're going to need some kind of roping material that's long enough to reach up to the top of the tower."
00:07:19.147,00:07:23.317,"Uh-ha, you know I never leave the lab without my super stunt yarn."
00:07:23.401,00:07:26.571,Too weak. It needs to lift a piano.
00:07:28.448,00:07:30.241,-Duct tape? -Too sticky.
00:07:30.324,00:07:32.952,-My spaghetti lunch? -Too stretchy.
00:07:33.035,00:07:34.454,Whoa! Oh!
00:07:34.537,00:07:36.664,Uh. And too sticky.
00:07:36.747,00:07:42.503,"Oh, Chico, where will we find something long enough and strong enough to lift a piano? Oh."
00:07:42.587,00:07:45.214,"Clark, you're sitting on it!"
00:07:45.298,00:07:48.509,"Oh, you mean this peanut lollipop? Now, how'd that get there?"
00:07:48.593,00:07:52.263,"No, not the peanut lollipop, the velvet rope!"
00:07:52.346,00:07:56.476,It's super long and it can support the weight of a full-grown elephant.
00:07:58.686,00:08:02.565,"-Now, let's build a wheelie thingy. -It's a pulley!"
00:08:03.065,00:08:04.734,A piano pulley!
00:08:04.817,00:08:08.738,"Right, let's design a piano pulley!"
00:08:29.926,00:08:33.930,"Ladies and gentlemen, Sir Elkin has never missed a show before."
00:08:34.013,00:08:35.932,Will this be the first?
00:08:36.015,00:08:38.559,"Two minutes to show time, gang."
00:08:38.643,00:08:41.270,"Which means, it's go time!"
00:08:41.354,00:08:42.730,"Okay, Tiny!"
00:08:48.986,00:08:51.322,"Oh, peanuts! It's too short."
00:08:54.951,00:09:01.332,"Clark, if you hold onto the piano and grab the velvet rope with your trunk, you can fill the gap."
00:09:01.415,00:09:03.793,You're long enough and strong enough!
00:09:03.876,00:09:09.006,"But it's going all the way up there, and I'm afraid of up there."
00:09:09.090,00:09:12.468,"Don't worry, mate. I'll be right up there with you."
00:09:13.177,00:09:14.262,Well...
00:09:20.351,00:09:23.396,"Okay, I'll do it!"
00:09:24.063,00:09:25.189,For Elkin.
00:09:30.987,00:09:35.074,"All right, Fix-It Force, time to bring the awesome."
00:09:35.157,00:09:36.200,"Hit it, Rainbow!"
00:09:36.284,00:09:39.537,Hang on to your whiskers. This pulley's going up.
00:09:48.462,00:09:52.592,Time for a glitter blast. Pow pow meow!
00:09:57.388,00:10:00.224,"Keep it up, Rainbow. It's working!"
00:10:00.308,00:10:03.311,"You're brave, Clark. Oh, no, don't look down."
00:10:03.436,00:10:09.150,"You know, Clarky boy, whenever I'm feeling scared, I like to sing me a little tune."
00:10:52.818,00:10:55.071,"Hello, Blunderburg!"
00:10:57.114,00:10:59.116,We made it to the top!
00:11:00.826,00:11:02.036,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:11:02.119,00:11:03.496,"All right, Clark!"
00:11:03.579,00:11:07.875,I'm on stage with Elkin John!
00:11:07.958,00:11:12.046,This is the best birthday ever!
00:11:12.129,00:11:14.632,Let's hear it for Clark!
00:11:15.049,00:11:18.135,The super brave birthday boy.
00:11:18.219,00:11:24.392,And a big thanks to Chico and the gang for solving me piano problem.
00:11:24.475,00:11:29.939,"Ladies and gentlemen, with the help of this incredible wheel thingy… Pulley!"
00:11:30.022,00:11:34.402,...Chico Bon Bon and the Fix-It Force have saved the day again.
00:11:34.485,00:11:41.409,"And I must say, when I hear a song this rocking, it makes me want to shake my tail feather!"
00:11:41.492,00:11:44.453,"Well, what you waiting for, Neil? Shake that thing."
00:11:47.456,00:11:48.457,Watch the hips.
00:00:57.932,00:00:59.142,It's a bird!
00:00:59.225,00:01:00.435,It's a plane!
00:01:00.518,00:01:01.728,"No, it's..."
00:01:01.811,00:01:03.980,Super Tiny!
00:01:04.064,00:01:05.815,Is Tiny flying?
00:01:08.109,00:01:11.654,It's just a bit of movie magic for Tiny in...
00:01:11.738,00:01:14.991,Super Tiny: The Quest For Cheese.
00:01:15.075,00:01:18.078,It's actually better than magic. It's science.
00:01:18.161,00:01:23.124,"We're using air pressure to hold Tiny up, and make it look like she's flying."
00:01:31.257,00:01:33.885,A tool that's sure to blow you away.
00:01:34.302,00:01:37.347,It clears away leaves... and also makes bubbles.
00:01:37.430,00:01:41.851,"Wow, but where's the air pressure? I don't see a thing."
00:01:41.935,00:01:44.562,You don't actually see air pressure.
00:01:44.646,00:01:47.232,"You feel it, like a gust of wind."
00:02:02.956,00:02:06.084,Chico Bon Bon. You got a problem? We can solve 'em!
00:02:07.043,00:02:10.964,"Chico. Oh, I've got a hot pizza problem that's getting cold fast."
00:02:11.047,00:02:14.843,Mr. McFluster? Pizza? Problem? Sounds exciting.
00:02:14.926,00:02:16.261,And delicious.
00:02:16.344,00:02:18.638,"Sit tight, we'll be there in a jiffy-jaff."
00:02:18.721,00:02:22.559,"Fix-It Force, time to bring the awesome!"
00:02:25.562,00:02:27.564,Rainbow Thunder!
00:02:28.148,00:02:29.357,Clark!
00:02:30.066,00:02:31.109,Tiny!
00:02:36.531,00:02:37.740,Whoa!
00:02:40.743,00:02:41.953,Whoa!
00:03:07.103,00:03:09.856,Why is it called Bridgeless Canyon?
00:03:09.939,00:03:11.024,Because...
00:03:11.733,00:03:13.943,there's no bridge across that canyon.
00:03:14.027,00:03:15.028,That makes sense.
00:03:15.111,00:03:17.780,Why do you need to get a pizza over there in the first place?
00:03:17.864,00:03:23.578,"Well, today Fluster Crust Pizza received an order from Herb the Hermit Crab, who lives over there!"
00:03:23.661,00:03:26.247,Where's my piping hot pizza?
00:03:26.789,00:03:27.916,He sounds crabby.
00:03:27.999,00:03:31.044,You see this super neat-o power delivery pizza badge?
00:03:31.127,00:03:32.212,Yes.
00:03:32.295,00:03:37.967,"It means I've never delivered a cold pizza, and that is not something I plan to start today."
00:03:38.051,00:03:40.178,"Mr. McFluster, you're in luck."
00:03:40.261,00:03:42.680,I've got just the tool for your pizza problem.
00:03:42.764,00:03:45.058,I call it the Pie Flier!
00:03:45.141,00:03:48.728,"Just grab your pizza pie, load her up, and let it fly!"
00:03:48.811,00:03:50.521,Stop!
00:03:50.605,00:03:55.151,"Mr. Bon Bon, Bridgeless Canyon is a strictly no-flying-pie zone."
00:03:59.364,00:04:01.532,"Nuh-uh-uh, no copters."
00:04:02.742,00:04:04.869,I could use my Glittercycle!
00:04:06.204,00:04:09.165,"No throwing, no copters, no cycles or vehicles of any kind."
00:04:09.249,00:04:10.333,-Um. -Huh.
00:04:10.416,00:04:13.211,"Well, what if we built a bridge?"
00:04:13.294,00:04:17.215,"Clark, that is so normal it just might work."
00:04:17.298,00:04:18.466,Group high five!
00:04:23.638,00:04:24.722,Just hurry!
00:04:24.806,00:04:29.102,"Once the thermometer turns fully blue, the pizza won't be piping hot anymore."
00:04:29.185,00:04:30.645,Then I can't deliver it!
00:04:30.728,00:04:32.730,One bridge coming right up.
00:04:32.814,00:04:35.858,"Fix-It Force, it's time to build a bridge."
00:04:44.117,00:04:46.452,Wow-wee! You really did it!
00:04:46.536,00:04:49.747,"And since it's made of wood, it's sturdy, strong, and..."
00:04:52.417,00:04:54.460,Just a few more pieces to go.
00:04:54.544,00:04:56.462,"Follow us, Mr. McFluster."
00:05:01.342,00:05:04.429,"Yes, your piping hot pizza is on the way."
00:05:08.933,00:05:11.102,Do you hear that?
00:05:13.521,00:05:16.190,Agh! Bridge-eating beetles!?
00:05:17.608,00:05:18.651,Run!
00:05:27.035,00:05:27.910,Oh!
00:05:28.786,00:05:29.829,Ah!
00:05:30.330,00:05:32.332,"-Thanks, buddy. -You're welcome."
00:05:32.957,00:05:34.083,A group high five?
00:05:36.794,00:05:39.380,What... just... happened?
00:05:39.464,00:05:40.757,Bridge-eating beetles.
00:05:40.840,00:05:43.134,"-Oh, what? That's a thing? -Yup."
00:05:43.217,00:05:46.220,"They're in my book, 100 Beasts of Blunderburg."
00:05:46.721,00:05:51.017,"-Bridge-eating beetles love to eat-- -Let me guess, bridges?"
00:05:51.100,00:05:52.935,How'd you know?
00:05:56.689,00:05:59.400,-...any type of bridge. -Seriously?
00:05:59.901,00:06:00.902,That is awesome.
00:06:00.985,00:06:02.278,That's not awesome.
00:06:02.362,00:06:03.946,It's the opposite of awesome.
00:06:04.030,00:06:06.657,"If they eat bridges, I can never deliver this pizza."
00:06:11.454,00:06:15.291,"unless we're talking about how many times we say never, which is never!"
00:06:25.968,00:06:29.847,"We'll just build a bridge out of something they won't eat. Clark, what do you got?"
00:06:29.931,00:06:30.807,Hmm...
00:06:31.307,00:06:32.433,How about...
00:06:33.518,00:06:34.852,steel?
00:06:34.936,00:06:39.565,"It's metal, so it's shiny, tough, and strong as..."
00:06:39.649,00:06:42.777,"-Well, it's as strong as steel! -Oh, fantastic."
00:06:42.860,00:06:46.406,There's no way a bridge-eating beetle can bite through this.
00:06:46.489,00:06:47.698,"Oh, no."
00:06:53.788,00:06:55.123,I stand corrected.
00:07:00.169,00:07:03.297,Your piping hot pizza will be there soon.
00:07:09.303,00:07:12.515,We keep trying until we find something these beetles don't eat.
00:07:12.932,00:07:14.976,"Oh, just do it quickly!"
00:07:15.726,00:07:16.686,Plastic blocks.
00:07:19.605,00:07:20.982,Stinky socks!
00:07:24.152,00:07:25.361,Grandfather clocks?
00:07:29.240,00:07:31.534,Oh! This isn't working.
00:07:31.617,00:07:34.745,"Correction, this isn't working yet."
00:07:35.371,00:07:38.958,"Chico, the pizza's getting dangerously close to cold. What do we do?"
00:07:39.041,00:07:41.502,"Goodbye, power pizza delivery badge."
00:07:45.131,00:07:49.760,"It may be against the rules, but my Pie Flier is the only solution that'll work."
00:07:49.844,00:07:51.137,"Chico, no!"
00:07:51.220,00:07:52.638,We're the Fix-It Force.
00:07:52.722,00:07:57.351,We build things. We don't break things. That includes the rules.
00:08:00.855,00:08:03.900,Then pull yourself together and take a banana break.
00:08:09.822,00:08:14.160,"Plastic blocks, stinky socks, and grandfather clocks."
00:08:14.243,00:08:16.621,But those bridge-eating beetles ate everything!
00:08:16.704,00:08:23.586,Oh! I wish Super-Tiny could just fly the pizza over there because nothing works-- Nothing works...
00:08:27.465,00:08:29.675,"Blazing bananas, that's it!"
00:08:29.759,00:08:32.261,We'll make a bridge out of nothing!
00:08:32.345,00:08:33.221,Huh?
00:08:33.304,00:08:38.726,"Well, not nothing. We'll use air pressure, like in Tiny's movie."
00:08:38.809,00:08:40.520,"Oh, I get it."
00:08:40.603,00:08:44.565,"If we set up a bunch of leaf blowers across then, whoo!"
00:08:44.649,00:08:48.069,Mr. McFluster and the pizza will float right across on the air!
00:08:48.152,00:08:52.532,"Uh, excuse me. Float across? Bridge of air?"
00:08:52.615,00:08:57.537,"It's not a bridge exactly, but it'll bridge the gap between here and Herb's house."
00:08:57.620,00:09:01.999,"And since there's no actual bridge, there's nothing for the beetles to eat!"
00:09:02.083,00:09:03.543,This could work!
00:09:03.626,00:09:06.712,"Fix-It Force, let's go catch some air."
00:09:07.713,00:09:10.466,"Hello, I'm Neil Ostrich with a special report."
00:09:10.550,00:09:13.177,The Fix-It Force needs your leaf blowers!
00:09:13.261,00:09:16.764,The fate of a power pizza delivery badge depends on it.
00:09:23.938,00:09:26.983,Now back to our regularly scheduled program.
00:09:36.617,00:09:39.829,-All blowers at full power. -Nice!
00:09:43.708,00:09:45.835,Do not deliver! Do not deliver!
00:09:45.918,00:09:48.796,Oh! We're too late. The pizza. It's...
00:09:50.548,00:09:52.133,"Oh, I can't deliver this!"
00:09:52.216,00:09:56.596,"Ah, bummer! Then I guess you won't mind if I do this."
00:10:03.436,00:10:04.604,Huh?
00:10:09.025,00:10:11.485,Bon Bon leaf blowers blow hot air!
00:10:11.569,00:10:14.614,Oh! It's a pizza miracle!
00:10:14.697,00:10:16.490,"Nah, just science."
00:10:16.574,00:10:18.409,"Now, go deliver that pie."
00:10:18.951,00:10:19.827,Uh!
00:10:29.378,00:10:32.048,"Go, Mr. McFluster! Go!"
00:10:32.798,00:10:34.550,"Ooh, bubbles."
00:10:39.138,00:10:41.098,Somebody's gotta turn it back on!
00:10:41.182,00:10:43.017,"-I'm on it! -Chico, wait!"
00:10:43.100,00:10:47.563,We need someone small who can get in between the blowers to reach the switch.
00:10:47.647,00:10:49.231,This is a job for...
00:11:04.038,00:11:06.290,"-Yay! -Way to go, Tiny!"
00:11:12.630,00:11:16.759,"Herb the Hermit Crab, I believe you ordered a piping hot pizza."
00:11:18.469,00:11:20.554,I said no onions.
00:11:21.055,00:11:22.264,Oh!
00:11:23.766,00:11:30.731,"After Mr. McFluster remade his order, Herb finally got to eat a piping hot pizza, which he describes as..."
00:11:30.815,00:11:31.691,Pretty good.
00:11:35.653,00:11:38.989,"With your help, I was able to keep my power pizza delivery badge."
00:11:40.783,00:11:43.411,"By the way, where is my favorite super mouse?"
00:00:55.013,00:00:58.099,Cleaning day status check. How's everyone doing?
00:00:58.183,00:00:59.267,Laundry folded.
00:00:59.809,00:01:00.935,Tools organized.
00:01:04.064,00:01:06.816,And the dirty dishes are almost clean.
00:01:06.900,00:01:09.027,What do you mean? There's loads of dirty dishes.
00:01:13.448,00:01:15.867,the amazing Dish Doer Deluxe.
00:01:15.950,00:01:21.122,Just place your dishes in the sink and the Dish Doer does the rest in four easy steps.
00:01:24.209,00:01:25.627,Spray it.
00:01:28.004,00:01:29.172,Scrub it.
00:01:31.925,00:01:33.093,Dry it.
00:01:36.054,00:01:39.140,"-Awesome use of automation, Chico. -Oh, thanks."
00:01:39.849,00:01:41.267,-Auto-- what now? -Automation.
00:01:41.351,00:01:47.190,"It's when a machine does something all by itself so you have time to, oh, I don't know..."
00:01:47.273,00:01:49.234,practice sponge-skating!
00:01:54.280,00:01:57.117,"Well, once these dishes are clean, we can eat some lunch."
00:01:57.200,00:01:58.660,I am hungry.
00:02:11.047,00:02:16.469,"No, Freddy. It's so much more! It's a pizzarito!"
00:02:17.053,00:02:21.850,Mamma mia! It's like a burrito and a pizza all in one.
00:02:23.101,00:02:25.186,Must have.
00:02:25.270,00:02:27.438,"Yummy, yum, yum!"
00:02:27.522,00:02:30.358,"Fix-It Force, let's gear up and go!"
00:02:30.942,00:02:32.527,Out to lunch.
00:02:35.029,00:02:37.532,Rainbow Thunder!
00:02:37.615,00:02:38.741,Clark!
00:02:39.784,00:02:41.035,Tiny!
00:02:50.712,00:02:51.921,Whoa!
00:03:09.397,00:03:12.150,I can't wait to eat a pizzarito! Oh!
00:03:14.194,00:03:21.784,"This is Neil Ostrich and today I'm in line for a pizzarito, the lunch craze sweeping Blunderburg."
00:03:21.868,00:03:23.328,How long will I wait?
00:03:23.411,00:03:25.205,However long it takes.
00:03:25.747,00:03:29.292,The line for pizzaritos is so long.
00:03:29.375,00:03:31.169,This is going to take forever.
00:03:31.252,00:03:33.963,"Agh, I thought this was supposed to be fast food."
00:03:34.047,00:03:37.217,"Oh, you're telling me. I've been waiting since this morning."
00:03:37.300,00:03:42.430,-I've been waiting since last night. -Aye've been waiting since last week.
00:03:42.513,00:03:44.974,Food shouldn't take this long to prepare.
00:03:47.602,00:03:50.730,"-Hello? -Fix-It Force, we need your help."
00:03:54.275,00:03:57.695,"Fix-It Force, time to roll some dough."
00:03:59.530,00:04:03.284,"Oh, Fix-It Force, thank goodness you're here."
00:04:03.368,00:04:06.996,We've got so many customers. It's terrible.
00:04:07.080,00:04:09.749,"Uh, isn't having a lot of customers a good thing?"
00:04:09.832,00:04:12.669,Not if we can't keep up with all of the orders.
00:04:12.752,00:04:15.463,"Hey, uh, how long's this pizzarito going to take?"
00:04:15.546,00:04:17.298,You've got to help us.
00:04:17.382,00:04:20.468,"Don't worry, the Fix-It Force can solve any problem."
00:04:20.551,00:04:24.806,I just hope you solve it before people start getting hangry.
00:04:24.889,00:04:26.933,Hangry? What's that?
00:04:27.016,00:04:31.813,Hangry. When you feel hungry and angry at the same time.
00:04:31.896,00:04:35.608,"-Dr. Merv joins us now to tell us more. -Thank you, Neil."
00:04:35.692,00:04:47.287,"My hangry meter shows that everything's all right for now, but if these folks don't eat soon, this neat little line could turn into a grumpy tummy-rumbly ziggy-zaggy disaster!"
00:04:50.873,00:04:52.500,Let's hope we eat soon.
00:04:53.543,00:04:58.673,"All right, to help you solve this problem, let's see how you make pizzaritos from start to finish."
00:04:58.756,00:05:03.052,Easy. There are three simple steps to making a pizzarito.
00:05:03.136,00:05:04.178,Observe.
00:05:06.472,00:05:11.019,Step one: melt the cheese and add it to your crust.
00:05:11.102,00:05:14.856,-Step two: roll it up. -But there's nothing in it.
00:05:15.273,00:05:19.569,"That's right, because step three is fill it."
00:05:19.652,00:05:25.033,Jam all the pizza sauce and the veggies and the beans in wherever you can.
00:05:27.785,00:05:31.247,"Attention, this pizzarito is out of order."
00:05:33.166,00:05:36.711,"Uh-huh, we need to rearrange the steps to make the process faster."
00:05:41.758,00:05:47.764,"But what if your order was fill it, roll it, melt it?"
00:05:47.847,00:05:49.724,"Oh, mwah!"
00:05:49.807,00:05:51.476,Step one: fill it.
00:05:52.435,00:05:57.899,"Add some sauce, beans, veggies and top it off with some un-melted cheese."
00:05:57.982,00:05:59.108,Yummy!
00:05:59.984,00:06:01.778,Step two: roll it.
00:06:03.196,00:06:05.782,Step three: melt it.
00:06:07.158,00:06:11.496,I don't believe it. An almost finished pizzarito.
00:06:11.579,00:06:15.500,Almost? We did all three steps. What did we miss?
00:06:15.583,00:06:17.752,Our final secret step.
00:06:17.835,00:06:21.798,An ingredient we've perfected over many years.
00:06:22.673,00:06:23.591,Boop!
00:06:23.674,00:06:29.263,The right boop adds that personal touch that makes a pizzarito taste mwah!
00:06:29.889,00:06:32.767,"Mmm, booped to perfection!"
00:06:32.850,00:06:37.313,"Now that the steps are in order, we'll be churning out these pizzaritos in no time."
00:06:37.397,00:06:39.315,"Okay, team, let's go!"
00:06:49.492,00:06:51.536,Mmm! Please stop!
00:06:51.994,00:06:53.996,This doesn't seem faster at all.
00:06:54.080,00:06:57.458,"When everyone does everything at the same time, we bump into each other."
00:06:57.542,00:06:59.043,What do we do?
00:06:59.127,00:07:03.548,"We're gonna whip out our umbrella, 'cause it's time for a brainstorm."
00:07:03.631,00:07:07.510,"Okay, how do we get pizzaritos made without crashing into each other?"
00:07:07.593,00:07:10.888,We can put on our rocket skates and have a pizzarito race.
00:07:10.972,00:07:13.641,"Whoever makes a pizzarito first, wins."
00:07:13.724,00:07:16.144,That makes me dizzy just thinking about it.
00:07:16.227,00:07:19.439,What if we each take turns making a whole pizzarito?
00:07:19.522,00:07:24.026,We can stand in line and cheer each other on and maybe-- Stand in line.
00:07:24.610,00:07:29.282,Wait. What if each of us are in charge of one step in the pizzarito process?
00:07:29.365,00:07:32.660,Like some kind of putting-together row.
00:07:32.743,00:07:34.579,Of course!
00:07:34.662,00:07:37.373,There's actually a name for that.
00:07:38.249,00:07:39.792,An assembly line.
00:07:39.876,00:07:45.131,"Now, because we're each in charge of one step, we won't get in each other's way and it'll be super fast."
00:07:45.214,00:07:46.716,"Okay, people."
00:07:46.799,00:07:49.343,Let's get this assembly line going.
00:07:49.427,00:07:50.303,Fill it.
00:07:53.431,00:07:54.265,Roll it.
00:07:55.016,00:07:56.392,Melt it.
00:07:59.312,00:08:00.771,Oh. Boop.
00:08:03.065,00:08:07.236,"Wow, at this speed we'll have all the pizzaritos done in no time."
00:08:08.488,00:08:09.906,"Ah, fill it."
00:08:14.494,00:08:15.995,Roll it.
00:08:17.830,00:08:21.083,What's the hold up? We still got lots of pizzaritos to make.
00:08:21.167,00:08:23.794,Ah! Uh! Ah! I'm up. Melt it.
00:08:23.878,00:08:26.881,"We're doing the best we can, but we're not machines."
00:08:26.964,00:08:28.341,We're getting tired.
00:08:28.424,00:08:31.802,"When I'm this exhausted, there's only one thing I need."
00:08:31.886,00:08:32.803,A nap?
00:08:32.887,00:08:34.180,A banana.
00:08:42.313,00:08:45.066,It didn't work when we all made pizzaritos at the same time.
00:08:54.075,00:08:58.788,Machines... Machines! A machine could do the job all by itself.
00:08:58.871,00:09:00.957,"Blazing bananas, that's it!"
00:09:01.040,00:09:04.794,We'll use automation to make an automated pizzarito maker.
00:09:04.877,00:09:08.422,"It'll be just like the Dish Doer Deluxe, except with pizzaritos."
00:09:08.506,00:09:12.802,We can use a conveyor belt to make a machine that performs each step in our assembly line.
00:09:12.885,00:09:16.556,"It'll make the food all by itself, without ever slowing down."
00:09:16.639,00:09:21.227,Just hurry. I think the customers are getting hangrier.
00:09:21.310,00:09:24.480,Many of us in line are still without a pizzarito!
00:09:28.734,00:09:30.236,I'm getting hangry!
00:09:30.319,00:09:32.655,"And when I get hangry, I stomp my foot."
00:09:34.156,00:09:38.202,"When I get hangry, I cluck like a chicken."
00:09:41.205,00:09:46.168,"Oh, when I get hangry, I sing the news."
00:09:55.303,00:09:58.723,"Don't worry, Lemurettis, we'll solve your problem in a jiffy-jaff."
00:10:02.602,00:10:07.523,"Lemurettis, may I present your new automated pizzarito maker."
00:10:10.776,00:10:11.819,Roll it.
00:10:12.653,00:10:14.113,Melt it.
00:10:14.196,00:10:15.031,Boop it.
00:10:15.156,00:10:17.283,"Wow, in record time."
00:10:17.366,00:10:20.036,Hmm. It looks like a pizzarito.
00:10:23.164,00:10:24.540,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
00:10:25.458,00:10:29.211,Agh! But it doesn't taste like a pizzarito.
00:10:29.295,00:10:30.338,Why not?
00:10:30.421,00:10:32.757,It's been booped all wrong.
00:10:32.840,00:10:34.759,We can't serve this.
00:10:34.842,00:10:36.677,We've gotta serve something.
00:10:36.761,00:10:38.346,"Betty, can you re-boop it?"
00:10:38.429,00:10:41.557,Uh... I can try. Boop.
00:10:43.934,00:10:45.978,Now that's a mwah!
00:10:46.062,00:10:48.606,Okay then. Betty will do the boops.
00:10:52.985,00:10:53.861,Boop.
00:11:11.671,00:11:12.546,Boop.
00:11:18.886,00:11:20.971,Hangry levels are returning to normal.
00:11:21.055,00:11:26.686,"And while it may have been maddening, everyone agrees these pizzaritos were worth the wait."
00:11:28.104,00:11:30.439,"Thank you, Fix-It Force."
00:11:30.523,00:11:35.611,You've solved another one of our food fiascoes. Bravo.
00:11:35.736,00:11:38.698,"Oh, glad we could help with your pizzarito problem-o."
00:11:38.823,00:11:43.160,"And thanks to automation, now we have time to, oh, I don't know..."
00:11:43.244,00:11:45.121,have a pizzarito race!
00:11:45.204,00:11:47.331,First one to make a pizzarito wins.
00:11:47.957,00:11:50.209,"Eh, I think I'll just have seconds."
00:00:57.474,00:01:00.018,The coolest thing in the world is happening today!
00:01:00.101,00:01:01.978,We're having banana nachos for dinner?
00:01:02.062,00:01:04.272,"No, it's even better!"
00:01:04.731,00:01:05.565,Look!
00:01:07.192,00:01:16.201,"It's your old friend Conductor Clyde, here to tell you the Choo-Choo Express is chugging in to your town today."
00:01:16.284,00:01:20.538,So come on down! And like I always say...
00:01:27.796,00:01:30.882,"Next stop, Blunderburg Station!"
00:01:30.965,00:01:33.676,I hope to see you today!
00:01:33.760,00:01:36.971,-Whoa! -That train looks awesome!
00:01:37.055,00:01:38.139,It is!
00:01:38.223,00:01:42.060,The Choo-Choo Express is powered by the sun!
00:01:42.143,00:01:43.061,Awesome.
00:01:45.772,00:01:47.357,No way!
00:01:54.739,00:02:03.998,"If we leave right now, we can get to Blunderburg Station just as the Choo-Choo Express is-- Ah... ah-choo!"
00:02:04.082,00:02:05.083,Gesundheit.
00:02:05.166,00:02:11.589,"Oh, excuse me. As I was saying, if we leave now, we can-- Ah... ah-choo!"
00:02:19.472,00:02:20.306,Oh!
00:02:20.390,00:02:21.683,"You okay, Clark?"
00:02:21.766,00:02:24.644,I've never seen sneeze-powered propulsion before.
00:02:24.727,00:02:26.646,Propul-- What now?
00:02:26.729,00:02:28.148,Propulsion.
00:02:28.231,00:02:36.739,"When you blow air with enough force in one direction, like your sneezes, it pushes or propels you in the other direction."
00:02:36.823,00:02:39.117,"-Ah... -Uh-oh, he's gonna blow!"
00:02:39.200,00:02:41.661,Ah-choo!
00:02:44.664,00:02:46.291,"Yay, propulsion."
00:02:57.385,00:03:00.138,-Chico Bon Bon. You've got a prob-- -Dr. Merv here.
00:03:00.221,00:03:03.850,Was that Clark I heard sneezing? I'll be there as soon as possible.
00:03:03.933,00:03:05.727,"Um, hi, Dr. Merv."
00:03:07.437,00:03:09.063,Sorry I couldn't get here sooner.
00:03:09.147,00:03:10.607,"Hi Clark, take this."
00:03:13.234,00:03:14.152,Gesundheit.
00:03:14.235,00:03:17.822,"What's this all about, Doc? Why's Clark sneezing so much?"
00:03:17.906,00:03:19.199,"Well, let's see."
00:03:19.741,00:03:22.202,Hmm. Say ah.
00:03:22.285,00:03:23.411,Ah.
00:03:23.494,00:03:25.413,Now say sweet potato pancakes.
00:03:25.496,00:03:27.457,Sweet potato pancakes.
00:03:29.375,00:03:33.379,You've got an elephant-sized case of elephant sniffles.
00:03:33.463,00:03:35.298,Elephant sniffles!
00:03:35.381,00:03:37.550,Ah-choo!
00:03:38.301,00:03:39.552,"Is there a cure, Doc?"
00:03:39.636,00:03:44.849,Clark needs to rest up on this couch until he gets every last one of his sneezes out.
00:03:44.933,00:03:48.519,"-When will that be? -Could be today, could be next week."
00:03:48.603,00:03:54.400,"But when that last sneeze comes, you'd better hang on to your hat, 'cause it's gonna be a doozy."
00:03:54.484,00:03:55.652,Uh...
00:03:55.735,00:03:56.861,"Well, I'm off."
00:03:56.945,00:03:59.739,I wanna get a good spot to see the Choo-Choo Express!
00:03:59.822,00:04:00.990,Whoo whoo!
00:04:01.449,00:04:02.909,"Oh, here's a sticker."
00:04:02.992,00:04:06.329,"Aw, peanuts. I'm going to miss the Choo-Choo Express."
00:04:06.412,00:04:13.795,A once in a lifetime moment and I gotta stay here with my elephant sniffle-- Ah-choo!
00:04:15.255,00:04:19.259,Poor Clark. Is there any way we can get the train to pass by the lab?
00:04:19.342,00:04:25.306,"I wish, but trains always stay on their tracks, and there aren't any tracks close enough for us to get a good look."
00:04:26.224,00:04:27.267,Wait.
00:04:27.350,00:04:33.523,"Dr. Merv said you have to stay on the couch, but she didn't say the couch has to stay here!"
00:04:33.606,00:04:38.361,"Fix-It Force, it's time to bring the couch to the train!"
00:04:40.863,00:04:43.366,Rainbow Thunder!
00:04:43.449,00:04:45.660,-Clark! -Ah-choo!
00:05:15.064,00:05:16.482,"You feeling good, buddy?"
00:05:16.566,00:05:19.193,"A little sniffly, but okay."
00:05:21.029,00:05:22.905,"Chico, you hear that?"
00:05:22.989,00:05:25.450,That's the Choo-Choo Express whistle.
00:05:25.533,00:05:27.368,Maybe you can see it from here.
00:05:28.244,00:05:29.912,Ah-choo!
00:05:33.374,00:05:34.834,Ah-choo!
00:05:34.917,00:05:40.048,Everyone's excitedly heading to the Blunderburg Station to see the Choo-Choo Express.
00:05:40.131,00:05:41.382,Choo!
00:05:43.551,00:05:45.595,Ah-choo!
00:05:51.601,00:05:53.227,"Arr, red lights."
00:05:53.311,00:05:55.313,Ah-choo!
00:06:00.401,00:06:01.402,Oh.
00:06:01.486,00:06:03.696,"Oh, Clark, are you all right?"
00:06:03.780,00:06:04.655,Fine.
00:06:05.073,00:06:10.870,We've gotta figure out some way to get Clark to the train without his sneezes propelling him off the van.
00:06:10.953,00:06:13.206,What if the couch wasn't on the van?
00:06:13.289,00:06:16.584,Maybe we won't have to worry about propulsion if we're...
00:06:17.126,00:06:18.586,in the air!
00:06:19.253,00:06:23.091,I can't look! Just let me know when we get to Blunderburg Station!
00:06:23.174,00:06:26.052,I think you're gonna wanna open your eyes for this.
00:06:26.135,00:06:27.470,Check out the view.
00:06:28.554,00:06:32.058,Is that the Choo-Choo Express?
00:06:32.141,00:06:33.768,It's almost here!
00:06:33.851,00:06:38.815,Wow! It's the most ama-- Ah... ah-choo!
00:06:38.898,00:06:41.567,Hang on! Mayday!
00:06:48.574,00:06:50.410,Let's not do that again.
00:06:50.493,00:06:57.417,"Well, it looks like sneeze propulsion works on land and in the air, but maybe it won't work on water!"
00:06:58.042,00:07:01.421,"Chico, I'm pretty sure propulsion works everywhere."
00:07:06.801,00:07:08.719,Track! That's it!
00:07:08.803,00:07:11.806,You can't blow us off track if we're on tracks.
00:07:11.889,00:07:14.225,We can turn the couch into a train!
00:07:14.308,00:07:16.894,"Rainbow, I don't like that idea..."
00:07:16.978,00:07:18.729,I love it!
00:07:18.813,00:07:25.736,Here's the plan: we can engineer some special train wheels for the bottom of the couch and build some tracks to Blunderburg Station.
00:07:25.820,00:07:30.450,That way even if Clark sneezes we won't be blown off course because...
00:07:30.533,00:07:32.994,Trains always stay on their tracks!
00:07:33.077,00:07:36.747,"Come on, Fix-It Force. Let's get this couch-train on track."
00:07:51.679,00:07:53.639,"The track is finished, Rainbow."
00:07:55.349,00:07:57.685,All aboard!
00:07:57.768,00:07:59.896,"Next stop, Blunderburg Station!"
00:07:59.979,00:08:02.982,Chugga-chugga whoo whoo!
00:08:03.065,00:08:08.529,"Please keep your hands and arms inside the couch-train and remember, hang on to your caboose!"
00:08:08.613,00:08:10.781,Pow pow meow!
00:08:17.371,00:08:18.956,We're almost there!
00:08:19.040,00:08:21.584,"Wait, why does it feel like we're slowing down?"
00:08:21.667,00:08:23.836,We're running out of glitter power!
00:08:26.964,00:08:28.424,"Chico, what do we do?"
00:08:28.508,00:08:31.969,The Choo-Choo Express is gonna leave Blunderburg forever!
00:08:32.053,00:08:34.430,Then we better see it while we can.
00:08:34.514,00:08:35.848,"Tiny, banana me."
00:08:42.355,00:08:46.150,"We've tried driving, but Clark's sneeze propelled him right through town."
00:08:46.234,00:08:50.196,"We've tried flying, but Clark's sneeze propelled the copter all over the place."
00:08:50.279,00:08:56.327,"Every time we try something, Clark's sneezes blew us away and-- Wait a minute."
00:08:58.913,00:09:01.123,"Blazing bananas, that's it!"
00:09:01.207,00:09:05.086,We can use sneeze propulsion to get us moving again!
00:09:05.169,00:09:14.679,"Yeah. If we point Clark's trunk this way when he sneezes, it'll blast us along the tracks that way toward the train. It's perfect!"
00:09:14.762,00:09:16.639,"Go on, Clark! Sneeze away!"
00:09:16.722,00:09:20.518,"Uh, I can't just make myself sneeze. They just sort of happen."
00:09:23.479,00:09:29.569,"Uh, think of sneezy stuff, like dust and feathers tickling your nose and, uh, did I already say dust?"
00:09:29.652,00:09:31.070,"Oh, this is a lot of pressure."
00:09:32.280,00:09:41.414,"The Choo-Choo Ex-- Ah... ah... ah-- -Oh, this sounds like a big one. -Ah... ah... ah-- -Maybe it's the last one. The doozy. -Aim his trunk and hang on tight!"
00:09:41.497,00:09:43.583,Ah-choo!
00:09:56.012,00:09:59.015,"Sounds like you got all your sneezes out, Clark."
00:09:59.098,00:10:00.182,You're cured!
00:10:00.266,00:10:01.892,Yay!
00:10:08.649,00:10:11.527,I can't believe I'm seeing this with my own two eyes!
00:10:13.070,00:10:15.156,And hearing it too!
00:10:15.239,00:10:18.659,"My, my! This train is incredible."
00:10:18.743,00:10:22.997,I know! The Choo-Choo Express is the best train in the whole wide world!
00:10:23.080,00:10:25.916,"Oh, not my train, friend. Your train!"
00:10:28.586,00:10:32.381,"Conductor Clyde, at your service. And, uh, you are?"
00:10:32.465,00:10:34.133,I... I... I...
00:10:34.717,00:10:35.968,That's Clark.
00:10:36.052,00:10:37.803,And all of us are the Fix-It Force.
00:10:37.887,00:10:41.682,I've never seen a sneeze-propelled train before.
00:10:41.766,00:10:45.436,-What do you call her? -We haven't really named it yet.
00:10:45.519,00:10:47.438,How about...
00:10:47.521,00:10:50.399,the Ah-Choo Express?
00:10:50.483,00:10:51.484,Yeah!
00:10:51.942,00:10:54.487,"Say, I got a swell idea."
00:10:54.570,00:10:58.783,Why don't you attach your train to my train and come along for a ride?
00:10:58.866,00:10:59.784,Really?
00:10:59.867,00:11:01.661,You betcha!
00:11:01.744,00:11:05.247,But I'm gonna need someone to pull that train whistle for me.
00:11:10.920,00:11:15.216,The best friends ever riding on the best train ever.
00:11:15.299,00:11:17.635,How could this day get any better?
00:11:17.718,00:11:19.220,How about a song?
00:01:02.645,00:01:05.231,Tiny passes more plastic... Chico dribbles...
00:01:05.940,00:01:07.317,he shoots...
00:01:07.776,00:01:09.527,He scores!
00:01:13.114,00:01:15.950,"Are you done fixing my lemonade problem yet, Chico?"
00:01:16.451,00:01:17.869,"Almost, Mr. McFluster."
00:01:17.952,00:01:19.079,Check it out.
00:01:19.162,00:01:21.498,The fantastic plastic printer.
00:01:21.998,00:01:23.666,Made by Chico Bon Bon.
00:01:23.750,00:01:27.545,This baby lets us reuse old plastic to make something new.
00:01:31.716,00:01:34.302,It even makes its own ice cubes.
00:01:34.385,00:01:37.138,"Oh, just what I need to keep my lemonade cool."
00:01:37.222,00:01:42.811,Just twist this super bendy plastic tray and ice cubes away!
00:01:42.894,00:01:45.647,Ooh. It is super bendy!
00:01:47.440,00:01:50.235,"Stay cool, Mr. McFluster. Stay..."
00:01:50.318,00:01:51.569,cool.
00:01:54.948,00:01:56.157,That's today.
00:01:56.241,00:02:01.162,It's time for the Flapjack Fliptacular.
00:02:01.246,00:02:09.587,Two fearless daredevils will rocket-skate down a track to a sizzling griddle to see who is the ultimate pancake flipper.
00:02:09.671,00:02:15.009,It's Storm Cloud Lightning versus Rainbow Thunder.
00:02:15.093,00:02:16.719,That's our Rainbow Thunder.
00:02:22.058,00:02:23.518,Whoa!
00:02:26.563,00:02:28.940,go spatula to spatula.
00:02:29.023,00:02:32.360,"-Whoo-hoo-hoo! Rainbow! -Go, Rainbow Thunder, go!"
00:02:32.443,00:02:34.737,"Wait, where is Rainbow Thunder?"
00:02:36.781,00:02:38.908,"Chico, the banana phone."
00:02:46.291,00:02:49.961,Chico Bon Bon! You got a problem? We can solve ‘em!
00:02:50.753,00:02:52.380,"Chico, I need your help."
00:02:52.839,00:02:55.133,"Rainbow, where are you?"
00:02:55.216,00:02:56.968,Um...
00:02:59.804,00:03:03.308,"Chico, Storm Cloud Lightning's one of the best flippers around."
00:03:03.391,00:03:08.396,"To beat him, I'll need to do something amazing: a triple pancake flip!"
00:03:08.479,00:03:10.190,A triple flip?
00:03:10.273,00:03:12.817,But that's never ever been done.
00:03:12.901,00:03:14.736,That's why I need your help.
00:03:14.819,00:03:20.200,We've gotta engineer a brand new spatula that can flip the flap out of a pancake.
00:03:20.283,00:03:23.453,"Rainbow, that problem's no problem."
00:03:23.536,00:03:27.165,"Fix-It Force, to the Spatulab!"
00:03:30.084,00:03:32.170,Rainbow Thunder!
00:03:34.672,00:03:35.673,Tiny!
00:03:41.095,00:03:42.347,Whoa.
00:03:45.350,00:03:46.559,Whoa.
00:03:55.902,00:03:59.197,Mmm... wait a second. Isn't the Spatulab just upstairs?
00:03:59.280,00:04:00.281,"Oh, right."
00:04:00.907,00:04:02.659,To the Spatulab!
00:04:03.868,00:04:08.831,"To do the triple flip, I'm going to need a spatula that's made of something flexible."
00:04:08.915,00:04:11.709,"That's when something bends, but doesn't break."
00:04:12.126,00:04:13.044,Flexible.
00:04:13.544,00:04:14.879,"Clark, any ideas?"
00:04:14.963,00:04:18.633,How about a bendy metal spatula?
00:04:20.385,00:04:22.512,No. Not bendy enough.
00:04:22.595,00:04:23.846,Cardboard!
00:04:26.391,00:04:27.725,Too bendy.
00:04:32.981,00:04:33.856,Sand?
00:04:35.316,00:04:36.150,Agh!
00:04:36.234,00:04:39.654,None of the spatulas have the right amount of flexibility.
00:04:40.280,00:04:42.282,Maybe you need a banana break.
00:04:42.365,00:04:43.449,Good idea.
00:04:54.252,00:04:58.715,All this thinking is making me thirsty. I wish I had an ice cold drink.
00:04:58.798,00:05:01.467,Wait a minute. Ice cold.
00:05:01.968,00:05:03.303,Ice cub tray!
00:05:04.804,00:05:06.556,Super bendy!
00:05:06.639,00:05:08.933,"Blazing bananas, that's it!"
00:05:09.017,00:05:12.437,We need to make Rainbow's spatula out of plastic.
00:05:12.520,00:05:14.230,Of course!
00:05:14.314,00:05:17.066,"Plastic can be really bendy, but doesn't break."
00:05:17.150,00:05:19.736,Just like Mr. McFluster's bendy ice cube tray.
00:05:19.819,00:05:23.698,It'll be purr-fect for doing a triple flip!
00:05:24.198,00:05:26.868,"Clark, my fantastic plastic printer, please."
00:05:37.754,00:05:39.630,"Give it a try, Rainbow."
00:05:46.804,00:05:47.889,Triple flip!
00:05:48.931,00:05:51.100,Mmm. And triple delicious.
00:05:51.184,00:05:55.897,"Thanks, guys. Now nothing can stop me from winning that Golden Pancake trophy."
00:05:56.397,00:05:58.316,"Nothing, you say?"
00:05:58.399,00:06:02.570,"Storm Cloud Lightning, what can we expect to see from you tonight?"
00:06:02.653,00:06:07.325,"Well, Neil, Rainbow's gonna be tough to beat out there, but I've got a secret weapon."
00:06:07.408,00:06:09.535,My flexible plastic spatula.
00:06:09.619,00:06:11.871,It's so bendy I can do this.
00:06:12.580,00:06:16.167,"One, two, three. Triple flip."
00:06:16.751,00:06:18.711,Mmm. Triple delicious!
00:06:19.712,00:06:22.507,"Storm Cloud can do the triple flip, too?"
00:06:22.590,00:06:24.092,"Oh, man."
00:06:24.175,00:06:28.888,"If Storm Cloud's got a plastic spatula like mine, there's no way I can win."
00:06:29.305,00:06:30.390,"Don't give up, Rainbow."
00:06:30.473,00:06:33.351,This competition's about flipping your flapjack with style.
00:06:33.434,00:06:36.479,"So it's not just the tool, it's how you use it."
00:06:36.938,00:06:37.855,Yeah.
00:06:37.939,00:06:41.234,You've gotta learn to use it with style.
00:06:41.317,00:06:42.276,Come on!
00:07:12.181,00:07:15.476,-Whoo hoo! Awesome! Way to go! -All right! Yeah!
00:07:19.147,00:07:26.154,"Hold on to your forks, 'cause the Flapjack Fliptacular is about to begin."
00:07:28.448,00:07:30.616,"Okay, champ, are you ready?"
00:07:30.700,00:07:33.327,Yeah! Nothing can stop me now...
00:07:33.995,00:07:36.789,because it's not just the tool...
00:07:39.041,00:07:41.252,Time to flip some pancakes.
00:07:46.257,00:07:48.342,"-Good luck, Storm Cloud. -You too."
00:07:48.426,00:07:49.886,See you on the flip side.
00:07:57.226,00:07:59.020,Here comes the flip.
00:08:07.028,00:08:09.113,A triple flip!
00:08:10.740,00:08:12.074,Judges?
00:08:15.328,00:08:18.456,A perfect score! That'll be tough to beat.
00:08:18.539,00:08:22.835,But let's see if Rainbow Thunder can do it.
00:08:23.252,00:08:26.547,Pow pow meow!
00:08:43.439,00:08:47.693,"Unbelievable, another triple flip!"
00:08:47.777,00:08:51.822,But will it be enough to impress the judges?
00:08:58.162,00:08:59.830,That means it's time for...
00:09:01.123,00:09:04.585,...the Thunder and Lightning round!
00:09:04.669,00:09:11.467,The one who dazzles the crowd with the most amazing moves will win the Golden Pancake trophy!
00:09:11.551,00:09:14.136,Flippers to the starting line.
00:09:14.220,00:09:15.888,On your marks...
00:09:17.056,00:09:18.224,get set...
00:09:19.600,00:09:20.810,flip!
00:09:36.617,00:09:38.619,"-Come on, Rainbow! -You can do it!"
00:09:57.555,00:09:59.348,Who will flip it?
00:10:07.690,00:10:08.566,Hold up!
00:10:08.649,00:10:15.072,"Storm Cloud, what if we use the flexible flipping power of both our spatulas on this last pancake?"
00:10:15.156,00:10:18.034,"You mean, you and I team up?"
00:10:18.117,00:10:21.871,"If we work together, I bet we can flip it four times."
00:10:21.954,00:10:23.873,A quadruple flip!
00:10:23.956,00:10:27.585,But that's never been done. You really think we can do it?
00:10:27.668,00:10:31.797,"I know we can, 'cause it's not just the tool..."
00:10:34.675,00:10:36.636,"Come on, follow my lead."
00:10:47.647,00:10:50.691,Pow pow meow!
00:11:03.329,00:11:09.585,They've joined forces and pulled off the first quadruple flip in history!
00:11:09.669,00:11:16.092,The winners are Storm Cloud Lightning and Rainbow Thunder.
00:11:18.594,00:11:20.012,-Yeah! -You did it!
00:11:20.096,00:11:21.972,"Nice moves out there, Rainbow."
00:11:22.056,00:11:25.726,Aw. I couldn't have done it without the Fix-It Force.
00:11:27.269,00:11:31.107,"But wait, there's two winners, but only one trophy."
00:11:31.190,00:11:33.150,I can fix that.
00:11:33.234,00:11:35.695,"Time to do your thing, trophy saw."
00:11:41.492,00:11:43.619,Yeah!
00:11:43.703,00:11:48.999,Now there's only one thing left to do: eat all these pancakes.
00:00:47.380,00:00:49.632,Monkey with a tool belt.
00:00:51.092,00:00:53.970,Chico Bon Bon and the Doggy Dilemma.
00:00:57.557,00:00:59.601,Check out our new couch!
00:01:00.185,00:01:02.562,"Uh, Chico, isn't that our old couch?"
00:01:02.645,00:01:07.776,"It was our old couch, but now it's a marvel of modern relaxation."
00:01:09.527,00:01:11.529,"Couch, activate Clark mode."
00:01:12.530,00:01:15.241,"Hey, is that a peanut cracker?"
00:01:17.243,00:01:19.871,Mmm. This new couch is delicious!
00:01:19.954,00:01:22.332,"Couch, activate Rainbow mode."
00:01:23.416,00:01:26.795,A secret skateboard compartment? Wicked!
00:01:26.878,00:01:30.298,"Couch, activate Tiny and Chico modes, please."
00:01:30.924,00:01:35.386,A tiny treadmill for Tiny and an earwax cleaner for me.
00:01:35.887,00:01:38.181,"Ah! Oh, that's it."
00:01:38.264,00:01:39.349,Yeah.
00:01:39.808,00:01:43.603,Now our plain old couch is a multi-functional miracle.
00:01:43.686,00:01:45.563,Multi-what-tional?
00:01:47.440,00:01:50.944,"Multi means many, and functions are what something does."
00:01:51.027,00:01:56.449,Put them together and you've got a multi-functional couch that can do a lot of things.
00:01:56.533,00:01:59.202,"Oh, boy, I'm learning things..."
00:02:00.036,00:02:01.704,and eating peanuts?
00:02:01.788,00:02:04.874,"Hey, I'm multi-functional too."
00:02:14.843,00:02:16.010,Chico Bon Bon!
00:02:16.094,00:02:18.388,You got a problem? We can solve ‘em!
00:02:19.055,00:02:20.265,Chico!
00:02:23.768,00:02:26.271,I've got a problem. A big one!
00:02:26.354,00:02:28.898,I have to see you right now.
00:02:33.736,00:02:35.905,"Hello, gang!"
00:02:38.992,00:02:44.455,My piano's got a flat E-string and it needs an oil change.
00:02:44.956,00:02:48.334,"That's right. It's multi-functional, gang!"
00:02:51.546,00:02:52.839,-Wow! -Awesome!
00:02:52.922,00:02:57.552,"Listen, while I'm getting my piano tuned up, can you take care of Bernie?"
00:02:57.635,00:02:59.053,Bernie? Who's Bernie?
00:03:00.889,00:03:02.891,"Aw, he's so cute!"
00:03:03.391,00:03:08.104,"But, Elkin, watching a dog, that's not normally the type of problem we solve."
00:03:08.188,00:03:12.650,"Oh, but I also need you to figure out what's wrong with Bernie's leash."
00:03:12.734,00:03:17.906,"Whenever we go for walks, he always wiggles loose and I can't figure out why."
00:03:17.989,00:03:19.949,A leash that needs a redesign?
00:03:20.033,00:03:22.493,Now that's a Fix-It Force challenge.
00:03:22.577,00:03:25.955,"What do you say, gang, up for a little doggy sitting?"
00:03:26.039,00:03:28.374,Oh-ho! You're just the cutest little doggy ever.
00:03:28.458,00:03:30.293,-Look at that little nose. -You're so cute!
00:03:33.129,00:03:34.547,"Thanks, Chico."
00:03:34.631,00:03:36.090,Be back this afternoon!
00:03:36.174,00:03:38.801,"Bye, Bernie! Kisses!"
00:03:39.344,00:03:42.138,"Come on, Fix-It Force. Let's gear up and go!"
00:03:42.764,00:03:44.140,For a walk.
00:03:47.393,00:03:49.520,Rainbow Thunder!
00:03:49.979,00:03:50.855,Clark!
00:03:51.981,00:03:53.191,Tiny!
00:03:54.359,00:03:55.401,Bernie!
00:03:57.987,00:04:00.448,And it looks like the leash fits well.
00:04:02.742,00:04:04.327,And you're so cute.
00:04:04.410,00:04:06.746,Then let's go for a test walk.
00:04:09.457,00:04:12.919,"Maybe the leash fits fine when he's still, but not while he walks."
00:04:13.002,00:04:14.712,Uh... where's Bernie?
00:04:17.507,00:04:19.968,"Fix-It Force, follow that dog!"
00:04:21.678,00:04:35.191,"I'm Neil Ostrich, your beak on the street, reporting live from the Museum of Really Fragile Things, full of treasures that are as breakable as they are beautiful, like this little gem."
00:04:49.080,00:04:50.707,"Oh, whoopsie!"
00:05:05.263,00:05:06.514,Whoa!
00:05:08.933,00:05:11.311,"Tiny, stop this wrecking ball!"
00:05:14.647,00:05:15.648,Hey!
00:05:15.732,00:05:18.943,"Mr. Dunderhead, there's a dog loose in your construction site."
00:05:19.027,00:05:22.739,"Uh, I think I'd know if there was a dog loose in my site."
00:05:24.073,00:05:25.700,"Come back, Bernie!"
00:05:26.451,00:05:31.372,"A dog in my construction site? What's next, an ice cream-eating alien?"
00:05:33.791,00:05:36.127,"Oh, where could Bernie be?"
00:05:38.838,00:05:41.049,"-Oh, Bernie! -Come here, you little cutie!"
00:05:42.091,00:05:44.510,Oh! He must have been thirsty.
00:05:45.094,00:05:48.681,Elkin wasn't kidding. You are good at wiggling out of this leash.
00:05:48.765,00:05:50.683,Do you think it's the leash's length?
00:05:50.767,00:05:54.854,Maybe it's too short and it's pulling just enough to let Bernie wiggle out?
00:05:54.937,00:05:57.774,"A longer leash, huh? Well, worth a shot."
00:05:57.857,00:06:00.777,Let me just grab some rope out of my tool belt.
00:06:01.611,00:06:03.863,"There. How does that feel, Bernie?"
00:06:03.946,00:06:06.532,"Oh, peanuts. He escaped!"
00:06:08.284,00:06:13.539,"And if you like this sparkly baby, you'll love this red ruby beauty!"
00:06:15.583,00:06:17.126,Hey! Ah!
00:06:17.210,00:06:18.920,My eggs have been poached!
00:06:19.003,00:06:21.339,-Whoops! -Yeah! Whoa!
00:06:22.465,00:06:23.716,No sign of Bernie.
00:06:23.800,00:06:25.843,It's time to use some tech. Clark?
00:06:25.927,00:06:27.053,On it.
00:06:27.136,00:06:28.805,Checking the doggy detector.
00:06:29.680,00:06:31.349,He's down here.
00:06:31.432,00:06:33.559,Uh... around the corner.
00:06:33.643,00:06:35.728,"Uh, hey, he's in there!"
00:06:39.190,00:06:41.943,"-There you are. -Oh, you had us worried, Bernie."
00:06:46.614,00:06:48.741,What is the matter with this leash?
00:06:48.825,00:06:53.955,"Maybe the leash's material is too slippery, and that's why Bernie can wiggle out of it?"
00:06:54.038,00:06:56.916,Try a different material. Great idea.
00:06:56.999,00:06:59.127,I have some non-slip string in here somewhere.
00:06:59.210,00:07:00.336,Here it is.
00:07:00.420,00:07:04.715,"Okay, Bernie, let's try this-- We lost him again."
00:07:09.387,00:07:10.763,Now it's personal.
00:07:13.349,00:07:17.812,And you'll be green with envy-- Ah! Whoa!
00:07:21.566,00:07:22.984,"There you are, Bernie."
00:07:23.067,00:07:25.027,"And there you are, skateboard."
00:07:25.528,00:07:27.613,I'm never letting you out of my sight again.
00:07:27.697,00:07:31.117,"I guess Bernie really likes music, especially smooth jazz."
00:07:32.743,00:07:36.873,Hmm! How do we redesign this leash so he can't escape?
00:07:36.956,00:07:38.416,Nothing's worked so far.
00:07:38.499,00:07:42.336,"Don't worry, Chico. We have lots of time to figure this out."
00:07:42.420,00:07:45.798,It's not like Elkin is coming back for Bernie right now.
00:07:47.508,00:07:49.969,"Chico Bon Bon, monkey with a dog leash."
00:07:50.052,00:07:54.765,"Chico, it's Elkin. I'm coming back for Bernie right now!"
00:07:58.644,00:08:00.146,"This is serious, team!"
00:08:00.229,00:08:03.316,We're out of time and haven't solved how to keep Bernie on his leash!
00:08:07.737,00:08:09.071,"Good idea, Tiny."
00:08:14.494,00:08:16.871,Then he wiggled out to get a massage.
00:08:16.954,00:08:20.958,And then he wiggled out to listen to some smooth jazz.
00:08:21.042,00:08:31.135,"Hmm… Well, maybe he wouldn't want to wiggle out of his leash if it did all the stuff he likes, the way our new couch does-- Blazing bananas, that's it!"
00:08:31.219,00:08:34.639,What Bernie needs isn't a longer or less slippery leash.
00:08:34.722,00:08:37.475,He needs a multi-functional leash.
00:08:37.558,00:08:40.019,A leash that can do many things?
00:08:40.102,00:08:41.771,Pow pow meow!
00:08:41.854,00:08:42.939,I get it.
00:08:43.022,00:08:50.696,"Just like our multi-functional couch could do all the things we needed, we'll make a leash that can do all the things Bernie needs."
00:08:50.780,00:08:53.574,And we'll make it as cute as you are.
00:08:53.658,00:08:54.617,Exactly.
00:08:55.117,00:08:57.620,"Fix-It Force, let's get to work."
00:09:02.708,00:09:05.711,"A bark-activated, multi-functional leash."
00:09:05.795,00:09:08.965,"In need of something to drink, just bark once."
00:09:29.944,00:09:33.072,This leash is a multi-functional bonanza.
00:09:33.155,00:09:36.367,"Moment of truth, let's go for a walk."
00:09:36.450,00:09:39.704,"Whoa, look, he isn't trying to wiggle out of his leash."
00:09:39.787,00:09:40.997,Success.
00:09:44.458,00:09:47.628,"Uh... guys, there's Elkin."
00:09:48.629,00:09:50.965,He's gonna get to the tree house before us.
00:09:51.048,00:09:52.842,Not if we can help it. Rainbow?
00:09:55.011,00:09:56.637,"Everyone, hop on."
00:10:00.766,00:10:02.518,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:04.979,00:10:06.897,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:09.108,00:10:11.110,"Oh, yeah!"
00:10:14.238,00:10:16.907,Whoa! Oh!
00:10:16.991,00:10:17.950,Yes!
00:10:38.095,00:10:41.724,"Oh, there's my little Bernie baby."
00:10:42.308,00:10:45.019,And look how well you're walking on your leash.
00:10:45.478,00:10:46.520,Wait a minute.
00:10:46.604,00:10:48.189,That's not your leash.
00:10:48.272,00:10:51.525,"Chico, what did you do to Bernie's leash?"
00:10:51.609,00:10:55.363,"We engineered a new bark-activated, multi-functional leash."
00:10:55.446,00:10:58.407,"It can do a lot of things. Go on. Show him, Bernie."
00:11:10.252,00:11:14.757,"With all of Bernie's needs covered, he'll never want to wiggle out of his leash again."
00:11:14.840,00:11:18.761,"I'm impressed, and if Bernie's happy, I'm happy."
00:11:18.844,00:11:20.513,All in a day's work.
00:11:20.596,00:11:26.018,And there's one more function built in to Bernie's leash that I think you'll both really like.
00:11:28.854,00:11:31.732,A microphone! Brilliant.
00:11:32.233,00:11:33.484,"Hit it, Bernie!"
00:00:58.016,00:01:00.310,"Oh, just a little to the right."
00:01:00.393,00:01:02.395,And there!
00:01:02.479,00:01:10.737,"Lumpy Brown Peanut, say hello to your new neighbors: the Mustache Peanut, the Car Peanut, and..."
00:01:10.820,00:01:14.199,"Hey wait, where'd my peanut that looks like a shoe go?"
00:01:14.282,00:01:17.952,Uh... nope. What about over here?
00:01:18.036,00:01:20.080,"Oh, Peanut!"
00:01:21.956,00:01:22.874,Whoopsie!
00:01:23.583,00:01:28.379,"Hey, where-- There you are."
00:01:29.464,00:01:30.840,Uh-huh!
00:01:30.924,00:01:34.636,"And five, six, seven, eight. Ooh, ooh, ah."
00:01:34.719,00:01:36.137,What are you guys doing?
00:01:36.221,00:01:41.684,"We're having a dance party because our new bigger, better disco ball just came in the mail."
00:01:42.102,00:01:53.822,"Ooh! Well, then I better get ready to boogie!0 Oh, peanuts! The disco ball is made of glass."
00:01:53.905,00:01:56.574,It must be broken into a million pieces.
00:01:56.658,00:01:58.535,"Uh, uh, uh, don't worry."
00:01:58.618,00:02:00.662,The disco ball is fine.
00:02:06.167,00:02:09.921,It's full of these super squishy packing peanuts.
00:02:11.381,00:02:12.507,Check it out.
00:02:12.590,00:02:23.101,"When something fragile like this disco ball falls onto the ground, the energy goes from the disco ball into the squishy packing peanuts so it doesn't break. It's called shock absorption!"
00:02:23.184,00:02:26.229,Shock absorption! Whoo-hoo!
00:02:26.312,00:02:29.607,"Oh, that's nuts! Peanuts, that is."
00:02:29.691,00:02:32.485,These packing peanuts are perfect for my collection.
00:02:43.955,00:02:47.625,Chico Bon Bon! You got a problem? We can solve ‘em!
00:02:47.709,00:02:50.086,This is Neil Ostrich...
00:02:50.170,00:02:52.672,And Nell Ostrich!
00:02:52.755,00:02:55.425,...reporting live from this phone call.
00:02:56.467,00:02:58.011,Oh... okay.
00:02:58.094,00:03:02.015,Our top story this morning: we've got a big problem.
00:03:02.557,00:03:05.894,We need to get our egg to Hatchery Hospital fast!
00:03:05.977,00:03:07.979,Because our baby is about to...
00:03:08.062,00:03:09.731,"Well, hatch!"
00:03:09.814,00:03:16.863,There's only one team that can help these nervous new parents now… the Fix-It Force!
00:03:16.946,00:03:19.240,"Neil, Nell, you got it!"
00:03:19.324,00:03:21.242,This problem's no problem.
00:03:21.326,00:03:24.454,"Fix-It Force, time to bring the awesome!"
00:03:27.373,00:03:29.876,Rainbow Thunder!
00:03:29.959,00:03:31.085,Clark!
00:03:39.093,00:03:40.053,Whoa!
00:03:43.431,00:03:44.265,Whoa!
00:04:03.159,00:04:04.452,"Rainbow, up there!"
00:04:08.498,00:04:09.624,Neil acquired.
00:04:10.541,00:04:12.085,Nell has been obtained.
00:04:12.168,00:04:14.003,And I've got the egg.
00:04:14.087,00:04:16.839,Let's get this egg to Hatchery Hospital fast.
00:04:16.923,00:04:19.217,"But first, the weather report."
00:04:19.300,00:04:25.181,"It's chilly out there, but our egg needs to stay nice and warm."
00:04:25.265,00:04:27.642,"Don't worry, Nell. We'll keep it in Clark's bubble."
00:04:27.725,00:04:31.104,It's got climate controls to keep the egg at the perfect temperature.
00:04:31.187,00:04:33.606,"Ooh, yeah! Oh, oh, oh, whoops!"
00:04:36.859,00:04:40.738,"Agh, I'm so clumsy. How can I keep the egg safe?"
00:04:40.822,00:04:43.783,"Hmm. I know what you need, buddy."
00:04:48.329,00:04:50.415,A super-safe egg-carrier.
00:04:53.584,00:04:57.922,"The heat's turned on, the egg is warm, and now we're ready to ride."
00:04:58.006,00:05:00.425,Next stop: Hatchery Hospital.
00:05:00.508,00:05:02.176,Hold on to your feathers!
00:05:11.686,00:05:15.273,Ostrich news here with your very local traffic report.
00:05:15.356,00:05:16.899,There's a lot of it!
00:05:20.069,00:05:21.821,How are we gonna get through?
00:05:25.742,00:05:28.328,"I see a way. Rainbow, turn left up here!"
00:05:30.371,00:05:33.916,Left on Beach Ball Boulevard. Right on Penguin Plaza.
00:05:36.336,00:05:37.795,This is...
00:05:42.008,00:05:44.761,"Oh, this road's too b-- b-- b-- bumpy."
00:05:44.844,00:05:49.307,"If we d-- drive through there, the egg will b-- b-- break!"
00:05:49.390,00:05:52.852,Then we need some shock absorbing materials.
00:05:55.021,00:05:58.274,Something soft and squishy to protect the egg from bumps.
00:05:58.358,00:06:00.360,"Soft and squishy, huh?"
00:06:04.238,00:06:06.366,Lug nuts? Lug-no.
00:06:10.119,00:06:12.205,They're super soft and squishy!
00:06:13.206,00:06:16.918,"Don't worry, little Eggy. These balloons will absorb the shock."
00:06:21.756,00:06:24.384,Whoo-hoo! It's working!
00:06:29.013,00:06:31.182,"Oh, no. The balloons!"
00:06:31.265,00:06:33.643,"Well, at least we made it through Jackhammer Junction."
00:06:36.479,00:06:40.108,because we're heading right onto Wrecking Ball Boulevard!
00:06:41.067,00:06:45.780,"We're out of balloons, but there's gotta be another material we can use to absorb those shocks."
00:06:45.863,00:06:47.865,What will Chico come up with?
00:06:47.949,00:06:51.077,We'll find out after a word from our sponsors!
00:06:51.577,00:06:53.287,Puffy Stuff Marshmallows.
00:06:53.371,00:06:57.708,"For when you can't get enough of that sweet, sweet puff."
00:06:57.792,00:07:02.672,"Hey, that's it! Marshmallows! They're super soft and squishy."
00:07:03.756,00:07:09.137,"Whoa, marshmallows are my favorite! Oh, you're gonna love them too, Eggy."
00:07:15.226,00:07:16.727,No bumps up here!
00:07:18.104,00:07:21.524,But all this excitement is sort of making me hungry.
00:07:28.489,00:07:30.324,"Yeah, we made it!"
00:07:30.408,00:07:32.869,"Guys, Eggy and I..."
00:07:39.876,00:07:42.962,"No, it wasn't. It was a burp-quake!"
00:07:47.133,00:07:50.136,Those burps are making the ground jiggle like jelly.
00:07:52.930,00:07:53.890,What idea?
00:07:53.973,00:07:56.267,We can use jelly to keep the egg safe.
00:07:56.350,00:07:58.644,But we'll need a kind that Clark won't want to eat.
00:07:58.728,00:08:01.689,Setting my mega tool to pistachio jelly mode.
00:08:04.817,00:08:09.697,That's a great idea. I'd never eat this. I'm strictly peanuts.
00:08:15.745,00:08:17.038,Whoa!
00:08:19.332,00:08:22.502,And look up there. It's the hospital!
00:08:28.007,00:08:29.926,We got here just in time.
00:08:30.009,00:08:33.471,Now all we have to do is get the egg to the egg-mergency room.
00:08:33.554,00:08:39.060,But here's a scoop: the egg-mergency room is at the tippety-top of the building!
00:08:41.020,00:08:44.815,And this just in: the elevator's broken!
00:08:44.899,00:08:47.193,"Yeah, this could take a while."
00:08:47.985,00:08:52.573,More breaking news: our egg's gonna hatch any second!
00:08:52.657,00:08:56.619,The quickest way to the egg-mergency room is through that chute on the roof.
00:08:56.702,00:08:59.121,We've gotta fly the egg up there fast.
00:08:59.205,00:09:01.165,"Clark, can you take the Clark Copter?"
00:09:01.249,00:09:03.584,"-Me? But what if-- -You got this, buddy."
00:09:03.668,00:09:05.795,I'll be with you every step of the way.
00:09:24.647,00:09:27.191,Don't give up. You can do this!
00:09:27.275,00:09:30.820,"I can do this... for you, Eggy."
00:09:33.739,00:09:35.032,"Just a little higher, Clark."
00:09:37.410,00:09:39.412,Now I just have to drop you in.
00:09:40.037,00:09:42.623,"Oh, but it's such a long fall. You might break."
00:09:43.291,00:09:48.087,"Chico, I need help! How do I drop the egg without breaking it?"
00:09:52.008,00:09:52.967,...now!
00:09:53.050,00:09:56.012,"Oh, no, I can't hear him! What do I do?"
00:09:56.095,00:09:57.597,What would Chico do?
00:10:00.558,00:10:04.020,I know what I need. A peanut break!
00:10:10.943,00:10:13.404,I need a shock absorbing material.
00:10:19.827,00:10:21.329,What else absorbs shock?
00:10:21.412,00:10:24.332,Shock absorption! Whoo-hoo!
00:10:24.415,00:10:27.793,"Oh, that's nuts! Peanuts, that is."
00:10:27.877,00:10:31.380,"Wait a second, packing peanuts."
00:10:33.341,00:10:38.721,"These packing peanuts were great for my collection, but they'll be an even better shock absorber."
00:10:44.810,00:10:46.354,"Don't you be scared, Eggy."
00:10:46.437,00:10:49.190,I'm going to make sure you stay safe and sound.
00:10:50.107,00:10:53.694,"A little to the left. Oh, oh, little to the right."
00:11:00.701,00:11:03.621,This just in: he did it!
00:11:22.556,00:11:27.520,"Ah-ha! Breaking news: it's me, Nina."
00:11:27.603,00:11:29.647,Here's an exclusive...
00:11:33.025,00:11:35.444,"-You did it, Clark! -Yay!"
00:11:35.528,00:11:37.113,"Now, let's celebrate."
00:11:39.115,00:11:42.201,Baby ostrich dance party!
00:11:42.284,00:11:44.954,"And five, six, seven, eight."
00:11:48.249,00:11:51.627,"-Oh, yeah. -Shake those tail feathers."
00:00:47.380,00:00:49.674,Monkey with a tool belt.
00:00:55.472,00:00:58.016,"Okay, Mrs. Coleslaw, all done."
00:00:58.099,00:01:01.394,"Oh, did you fix my refrigerator, Chico?"
00:01:03.229,00:01:06.691,We engineered a totally new and improved refrigerator.
00:01:06.775,00:01:10.695,Behold the Frosty Fridge 4000.
00:01:10.779,00:01:13.782,"I designed it just for you. Tiny, let's turn it on."
00:01:15.283,00:01:17.619,"Now, I made it super simple."
00:01:17.702,00:01:19.704,Press this button once...
00:01:20.663,00:01:21.623,for ice.
00:01:22.207,00:01:23.083,Ah!
00:01:24.918,00:01:26.169,for crushed ice.
00:01:26.878,00:01:27.712,Ah!
00:01:30.548,00:01:32.842,for a tasty shaved-ice treat.
00:01:40.141,00:01:44.687,"Oh, Chico, everything is exactly the way I like it."
00:01:44.771,00:01:48.566,And I've programmed it to tell super funny jokes!
00:01:49.067,00:01:51.319,Why did the cookie go to the doctor?
00:01:53.863,00:01:56.199,"It was feeling crummy. Ha, ha, ha."
00:01:57.784,00:02:00.745,We also noticed you like magnets.
00:02:02.997,00:02:06.126,"Now, magnets don't stick to just any kind of metal."
00:02:06.209,00:02:07.210,Tiny?
00:02:10.380,00:02:16.177,"That's why we made your fridge out of iron, a type of metal magnets always stick to."
00:02:20.098,00:02:21.891,"Yay, magnets!"
00:02:21.975,00:02:25.019,"Oh, he is just the most perfect thing ever."
00:02:25.562,00:02:28.398,I love my little Fridgey Boo-boo.
00:02:28.481,00:02:30.150,"Thank you, Chico."
00:02:30.233,00:02:31.901,All in a day's work for...
00:02:31.985,00:02:33.778,the Fix-It Force!
00:02:34.195,00:02:35.446,Enjoy the new fridge.
00:02:39.909,00:02:41.786,I don't know. Why?
00:02:41.870,00:02:44.414,"Because he was stuffed. Ha, ha, ha."
00:02:53.464,00:02:56.384,"Mmm, now, what was it again?"
00:02:56.467,00:03:01.723,"Oh, press one, two, three times for shaved ice."
00:03:07.061,00:03:09.480,Super Ice Cube Mode activated.
00:03:18.323,00:03:19.324,Whoa!
00:03:24.913,00:03:28.041,"Fridgey Boo-boo, oh, come back!"
00:03:34.714,00:03:38.426,"Oh no, no, no. Too scary, Clark. Don't watch!"
00:03:38.509,00:03:41.596,"Aw, don't worry, buddy. It's just a movie."
00:03:41.679,00:03:45.225,"Yeah, giant robots don't walk around in real life."
00:03:49.145,00:03:50.813,"Uh, Chico?"
00:04:01.241,00:04:04.702,Chico Bon Bon! You got a problem? We can solve ‘em!
00:04:04.786,00:04:11.167,"Chico! Oh, I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm calling about my new refrigerator."
00:04:11.251,00:04:12.377,Is it running okay?
00:04:13.711,00:04:14.921,Chico...
00:04:15.004,00:04:18.258,"Oh, it's definitely running..."
00:04:20.385,00:04:24.597,and stomping and smashing!
00:04:24.681,00:04:30.019,"Oh, Chico, I think it may have turned into a giant robot."
00:04:30.103,00:04:32.438,A giant robot? Are you sure?
00:04:32.522,00:04:36.567,The Frosty Fridge 4000 wasn't designed to turn into a-- Chico!
00:04:36.651,00:04:38.111,...giant robot.
00:04:39.445,00:04:41.781,"Mrs. Coleslaw, we're on our way!"
00:04:41.864,00:04:45.743,"Fix-It Force, time to bring the awesome!"
00:04:48.246,00:04:50.748,Rainbow Thunder!
00:04:50.832,00:04:51.958,Clark!
00:04:53.001,00:04:54.252,Tiny!
00:04:59.674,00:05:00.925,Whoa!
00:05:03.928,00:05:05.138,Whoa!
00:05:22.905,00:05:25.992,Breaking news! Blunderburg's big chill.
00:05:26.075,00:05:30.246,"I'm Neil Ostrich, your beak on the very frigid street."
00:05:30.330,00:05:38.546,Things are getting chilly as it appears a giant robotic refrigerator is turning Blunderburg into an iceberg.
00:05:38.629,00:05:46.971,"Things that are usually warm are suddenly becoming quite cold, and things that are usually cold are becoming totally frozen."
00:05:47.513,00:05:51.225,"And if that wasn't enough, this robot also tells jokes."
00:05:51.309,00:05:54.645,What did one popsicle say to the other popsicle?
00:05:54.729,00:05:56.898,"-Uh, what? -Ice to meet you."
00:05:58.483,00:06:00.234,He really landed that joke.
00:06:03.071,00:06:05.198,What can't this robot do?
00:06:09.035,00:06:10.328,Ah!
00:06:11.871,00:06:12.705,Huh?
00:06:21.589,00:06:25.051,I must have pressed that button a few too many times.
00:06:25.134,00:06:28.554,"Oh, I guess my Fridgey had a bit of a growth spurt."
00:06:29.180,00:06:30.848,"Nice work, Mrs. Coleslaw."
00:06:33.643,00:06:37.772,"If I can get close enough, I can turn off his power."
00:06:38.689,00:06:41.025,Launching Clark-copter now!
00:06:49.409,00:06:51.702,"Come on, copter claws."
00:06:51.786,00:06:54.247,How do you get a squirrel to like you?
00:06:54.330,00:06:57.792,"-Uh, how? -Act like a nut! Ha, ha, ha."
00:07:02.713,00:07:03.840,Peanuts!
00:07:04.715,00:07:05.842,Whoa!
00:07:06.509,00:07:07.552,Phew!
00:07:13.558,00:07:17.645,"Okay, Fix-it Force, we gotta stop this robot."
00:07:18.729,00:07:22.608,"Whip out the umbrella, 'cause it's time for a brainstorm."
00:07:22.692,00:07:24.235,"Okay, what do we got people?"
00:07:24.318,00:07:25.445,Glue cannon.
00:07:30.867,00:07:32.034,Not sticky enough.
00:07:32.118,00:07:33.244,Trippy rope.
00:07:38.791,00:07:40.168,Not trippy enough.
00:07:40.251,00:07:44.922,It looks like it's time for... the jaws of steel.
00:07:48.342,00:07:51.012,Would you-- What-- What happened to the jaws of steel?
00:07:51.095,00:07:53.097,"We replaced them with a glitter horn, remember?"
00:07:58.311,00:08:01.272,My poor Fridgey Boo-boo.
00:08:01.355,00:08:05.526,"Oh, this little magnet is all I have left of him."
00:08:05.610,00:08:07.361,"What do we do, Chico?"
00:08:11.073,00:08:13.784,Maybe it's time for a banana break.
00:08:26.339,00:08:30.259,And now poor Mrs. Coleslaw won't have a place to put her magnets.
00:08:30.343,00:08:31.427,Magnets.
00:08:31.511,00:08:33.554,Magnets are attracted to iron.
00:08:33.638,00:08:35.765,The fridge is made of iron.
00:08:36.390,00:08:38.392,Blazing bananas that's it!
00:08:41.854,00:08:44.982,"But, Chico, the only magnet we have is this tiny one."
00:08:45.066,00:08:54.742,"That's true, but if we get enough small magnets, we can combine them to create a mega magnet with enough magnetic force to stop the Fridge Bot."
00:08:54.825,00:08:55.910,Exactly!
00:08:55.993,00:08:59.163,Time for Operation Mega Magnet.
00:08:59.247,00:09:03.834,"We've got to get every magnet we can find. Ready, set, go!"
00:09:04.835,00:09:06.170,"Clark, I said, Go!"
00:09:06.254,00:09:07.171,"Oh, right."
00:09:35.491,00:09:39.954,"Ah, I love the smell of giant magnets in the morning."
00:09:40.037,00:09:41.622,"It's nighttime, Chico."
00:09:44.417,00:09:45.334,danger!
00:09:45.418,00:09:46.294,Look!
00:09:49.714,00:09:53.509,What do you get when you cross a vampire and a snowman?
00:09:53.593,00:09:57.263,"Fridgey! Oh, this is no time to joke."
00:09:57.346,00:10:00.016,"Just, please, come home."
00:10:00.099,00:10:01.475,You get frostbite.
00:10:03.644,00:10:06.856,"Oh, I just can't help it. You're so funny, Fridgey."
00:10:06.939,00:10:10.109,We gotta stop them before they go stomping over that cliff!
00:10:13.904,00:10:17.074,We're in range. Fire the mega magnet now!
00:10:19.952,00:10:21.412,"The other button, Clark."
00:10:21.495,00:10:22.330,Oh!
00:10:34.383,00:10:36.177,"Oh-ho, they're sticking all right."
00:10:38.137,00:10:40.139,But now they've got us!
00:10:46.145,00:10:48.481,"Tiny, activate super tire treads!"
00:10:55.154,00:10:58.032,"Rainbow, initiate-- Rainbow?"
00:10:58.115,00:11:00.993,-What are you doing? -Don't worry. I got this.
00:11:07.416,00:11:08.501,Whoa.
00:11:09.001,00:11:09.835,Oh!
00:11:12.755,00:11:14.882,"Bye-bye, Fridge Bot."
00:11:21.639,00:11:25.893,"Oh, Fridgey, you're finally safe and sound."
00:11:25.976,00:11:30.773,Better make a few adjustments so we never see that crazy Mr. Fridge Bot again.
00:11:36.237,00:11:37.988,Where is popcorn?
00:11:40.241,00:11:46.831,"Oh, Chico. I just love my new and improved Fridgey Boo-boo."
00:11:46.914,00:11:48.207,All in a day's work for...
00:00:47.380,00:00:51.009,Monkey with a tool belt.
00:00:56.681,00:01:03.855,"Neil Ostrich reporting to you live on Cupcake Day, that special holiday when friends give each other cupcakes."
00:01:03.938,00:01:07.275,"-Happy Cupcake Day! -Oh, thanks!"
00:01:13.865,00:01:17.118,"So, who are we sending a cupcake to first?"
00:01:17.202,00:01:18.578,Mr. McFluster!
00:01:18.661,00:01:22.499,"Oh, today he's hard at work cleaning the top of Blunderburg Tower."
00:01:23.083,00:01:24.042,Hiya!
00:01:26.503,00:01:29.881,With a cupcake powered hot-air balloon!
00:01:29.964,00:01:33.259,One cupcake coming right up.
00:01:33.343,00:01:36.471,"Chico, what makes the balloon float up into the air?"
00:01:36.554,00:01:38.014,Is it magic frosting?
00:01:38.098,00:01:41.434,"It's better than magic, Clark. It's science!"
00:01:41.518,00:01:46.481,"The candle heats the air inside the balloon, making it hotter than the air outside."
00:01:46.564,00:01:49.943,"And since hot air rises, the balloon floats up!"
00:01:50.026,00:01:52.779,"Huh, so it's not the frosting."
00:01:58.743,00:02:02.789,"And a very happy Cupcake Day to you too, Mr. McFluster!"
00:02:04.374,00:02:05.750,The banana phone!
00:02:13.258,00:02:16.636,Chico Bon Bon. You got a problem? We can solve 'em!
00:02:17.262,00:02:21.933,"Chico, me hearty, 'tis your favorite pirate, Captain Squirrel Beard!"
00:02:22.016,00:02:23.476,The squirrel with a beard!
00:02:23.560,00:02:27.355,"And boy, do I have a doozy of a cupcake problem."
00:02:27.438,00:02:30.525,"Well, you called the right monkey business, Captain."
00:02:30.608,00:02:32.235,We'll be there in a jiffy-jaff.
00:02:32.318,00:02:34.779,"Oh, a thousand thanks, Chico!"
00:02:34.863,00:02:36.614,I'll send ya me location now.
00:02:36.698,00:02:38.366,Firing the cannon!
00:02:44.038,00:02:44.873,Huh?
00:02:44.956,00:02:46.082,An acorn?
00:02:47.417,00:02:50.837,There's a map inside! It'll lead us to Squirrel Beard.
00:02:50.920,00:02:55.341,"Fix-It Force, time to bring the arr-some!"
00:02:58.303,00:03:00.388,Rainbow Thunder!
00:03:00.930,00:03:02.140,Clark!
00:03:35.673,00:03:38.968,I think we found Captain Squirrel Beard.
00:03:39.052,00:03:40.762,"Ahoy, mateys!"
00:03:40.845,00:03:42.597,"Ahoy there, Captain!"
00:03:42.680,00:03:43.765,We're coming up.
00:03:43.848,00:03:47.602,"Sorry, Chico. But only pirates be allowed aboard me ship."
00:03:49.812,00:03:53.399,"-What did you say, Captain? -Coming aboard a ship without asking?"
00:03:53.483,00:03:55.985,I like it. Very piratey!
00:03:56.069,00:03:57.320,Welcome aboard!
00:04:00.365,00:04:02.533,"Oh, if only it were happy."
00:04:02.617,00:04:05.411,But how can a pirate be happy stuck on dry land...
00:04:05.912,00:04:09.040,when there's precious cupcake cargo to deliver?
00:04:09.123,00:04:11.209,How did you get stuck here anyways?
00:04:11.292,00:04:16.965,"Gather round, me hearties, for a tale of wonder and woe."
00:04:17.507,00:04:18.841,And mostly woe.
00:04:18.925,00:04:20.009,Whoa!
00:04:24.472,00:04:25.348,Whoa!
00:04:29.602,00:04:30.436,Whoa!
00:04:34.649,00:04:35.775,Whoa!
00:04:41.406,00:04:43.408,Whoa! Really?
00:04:43.491,00:04:45.451,"Well, I think that's what happened."
00:04:45.535,00:04:49.706,"I went below deck to check on me cupcake and when I came up, my ship had washed up here!"
00:04:49.789,00:04:51.040,Poor Sprinkles!
00:04:51.124,00:04:52.959,Is Sprinkles your ship's name?
00:04:53.042,00:04:56.170,Course not. Me ship's name is The Scurvy Acorn.
00:04:56.254,00:04:58.298,Sprinkles is a sea monster.
00:04:58.381,00:05:00.008,A sea monster?
00:05:00.091,00:05:04.929,"Well, not just any sea monster, matey. She's me best friend in the world."
00:05:06.097,00:05:11.144,And that's why it's so important that I get to Dessert Island to deliver this cupcake to her.
00:05:11.227,00:05:14.605,"It's a special ice cream cupcake, just for Sprinkles."
00:05:14.689,00:05:17.150,She really loves ice cream.
00:05:20.236,00:05:24.532,"Captain, we'll have you unstuck and off to Dessert Island in no time."
00:05:24.615,00:05:26.326,We just need to figure out how.
00:05:26.409,00:05:28.619,Too bad the ship isn't in the water anymore.
00:05:28.703,00:05:31.497,Then we could just sail it straight to Dessert Island.
00:05:34.000,00:05:38.379,"If we can't bring the ship to water, maybe we can bring water to the ship."
00:05:38.463,00:05:40.715,Time to get our feet wet.
00:05:41.424,00:05:44.052,Get ready to release the water on my count.
00:05:44.135,00:05:47.430,"Three, two, one, go!"
00:05:48.056,00:05:50.224,Thar she blows!
00:05:54.228,00:05:56.189,"Chico, it be working."
00:05:56.272,00:05:58.149,The water is floating me boat.
00:06:03.279,00:06:04.489,Oh.
00:06:06.324,00:06:09.786,Something's wrong. The ship isn't moving anymore.
00:06:09.869,00:06:12.038,Looks like there's just not enough water.
00:06:12.121,00:06:14.957,Hmm. We may need another plan.
00:06:17.210,00:06:18.252,Whoa! Ugh!
00:06:18.336,00:06:19.337,...slip.
00:06:19.420,00:06:20.838,I'm okay.
00:06:23.674,00:06:26.302,What if we had something slippery to move the ship with?
00:06:26.386,00:06:29.055,"Hmm, something slippery."
00:06:29.138,00:06:31.391,-Something like-- -Bananas?
00:06:31.474,00:06:34.644,"Not bananas, but banana peels!"
00:06:34.727,00:06:36.896,Lots and lots of banana peels!
00:06:39.774,00:06:40.858,Ow!
00:06:40.942,00:06:42.735,"Ah, whatever floats your boat."
00:06:42.819,00:06:47.031,But be quick! This midday sun is really taking its toll on me ice cream cupcake.
00:06:47.115,00:06:50.743,You heard the pirate. Sprinkles the sea monster needs her cupcake.
00:06:53.830,00:06:56.666,Let's slip and slide this ship right out of here!
00:06:56.749,00:06:57.583,Rainbow?
00:06:57.667,00:06:59.293,Hang on to your whiskers!
00:07:01.546,00:07:03.214,"Hey, we're moving!"
00:07:03.297,00:07:04.882,"Keep going, Rainbow!"
00:07:04.966,00:07:07.927,"Arr, I'm giving it everything she's got, Captain."
00:07:11.931,00:07:14.350,The ship's too heavy for TF One to pull!
00:07:14.434,00:07:17.395,Even with slippery banana peels to slide on.
00:07:17.478,00:07:19.981,We may need another plan.
00:07:20.731,00:07:25.069,"What if the ship had its own wheels, just like TF One?"
00:07:25.153,00:07:27.238,Then we could roll it out of here.
00:07:27.321,00:07:29.657,"Rainbow, I don't like that idea..."
00:07:29.740,00:07:31.492,I love it!
00:07:32.160,00:07:33.703,"How's it going, Chico?"
00:07:33.786,00:07:35.955,Almost done. How's the cupcake?
00:07:43.004,00:07:44.130,"Hurry, Chico!"
00:07:45.214,00:07:51.762,"Okay, team, let's get ready to push. When I give the signal, Squirrel Beard, you steer the ship out of the intersection, okay?"
00:07:51.846,00:07:52.972,"Aye, aye!"
00:07:53.055,00:07:55.183,To Dessert Island!
00:07:55.266,00:07:57.602,"Just hold on, cupcake. You're gonna make it."
00:07:57.685,00:07:59.312,You hear me? You're gonna make it!
00:07:59.395,00:08:00.897,Don't you quit on me!
00:08:00.980,00:08:04.108,"Okay, three, two, one..."
00:08:04.192,00:08:05.776,push!
00:08:06.277,00:08:08.613,"Squirrel Beard, steer us out of here!"
00:08:11.532,00:08:14.869,"Hey, it's some kind of Cupcake Day parade!"
00:08:18.539,00:08:19.832,Great. Keep going!
00:08:19.916,00:08:24.587,"Happy Cupcake Day, ye landlubbers! Whoo-hoo!"
00:08:24.670,00:08:26.214,"Here I come, Sprinkles."
00:08:30.009,00:08:32.720,Whoa! What was that?
00:08:35.681,00:08:40.686,Chico! 'Tis the end for me and my poor ice cream cupcake.
00:08:40.770,00:08:45.107,"We're now not only stuck on land, we're stuck between these buildings, too!"
00:08:47.276,00:08:50.613,My poor pal Sprinkles.
00:08:50.696,00:08:52.031,Poor Squirrel Beard.
00:08:52.114,00:08:57.995,"His cupcake is melting, his ship is still stuck, and he's still no closer to Dessert Island."
00:08:59.247,00:09:02.375,"Ah, this is so time for a banana break."
00:09:07.838,00:09:11.342,"We tried to add water, but we didn't have enough to float it."
00:09:11.425,00:09:23.104,"And then we tried to slide it out, but the ship was too heavy to move, And then we gave it wheels and tried to push it out, but it was too big to fit between the buildings."
00:09:23.187,00:09:29.860,"And if we don't do something soon, poor Captain Squirrel Beard's ice cream cupcake is gonna be completely melted!"
00:09:29.944,00:09:34.615,And he won't get to give his cupcake to Sprinkles like we floated ours to Mr. McFluster.
00:09:34.699,00:09:37.243,"Wait a minute, float!"
00:09:38.411,00:09:40.454,"Blazing bananas, that's it!"
00:09:40.538,00:09:42.665,We can float the boat to Sprinkles.
00:09:42.748,00:09:44.208,Of course!
00:09:44.292,00:09:51.173,"If we build a big enough balloon, we can use hot air to float the boat up and out of the intersection!"
00:09:51.257,00:09:52.925,Yay! Hot air!
00:09:53.009,00:09:55.344,"Clark, Rainbow, you two grab the sails."
00:09:55.428,00:09:57.305,"Tiny, start threading a needle."
00:09:57.388,00:09:59.682,We've got a balloon to build.
00:10:05.438,00:10:07.982,But what'll we use for our heat source?
00:10:08.065,00:10:09.233,I got it covered.
00:10:10.401,00:10:11.444,Candles!
00:10:11.902,00:10:12.987,Lots of 'em.
00:10:13.070,00:10:16.824,"Chico, I don't see how a few candles can-- Whoa!"
00:10:16.907,00:10:18.576,Hmm. We're moving.
00:10:18.659,00:10:20.453,What is this sorcery?
00:10:20.536,00:10:22.288,It isn't magic frosting.
00:10:23.080,00:10:24.999,It's the power of hot air.
00:10:25.082,00:10:28.502,The candles are heating the air inside the balloon.
00:10:28.586,00:10:31.589,And since hot air rises...
00:10:31.672,00:10:34.300,Me ship is floating up into the air!
00:10:43.726,00:10:46.562,Hurry! The cupcake's almost melted.
00:10:46.646,00:10:47.605,Anchors aweigh!
00:10:53.277,00:10:55.029,Cool down the air.
00:10:56.781,00:10:59.367,Blow me down! 'Tis working.
00:11:04.246,00:11:06.123,"Now, to find Sprinkles!"
00:11:06.207,00:11:10.336,"Sprinkles! Sprinkles, me girl, where are ye?"
00:11:25.518,00:11:29.397,"Doh, happy Cupcake Day to you too, Sprinkles."
00:11:29.480,00:11:33.025,"In fact, I have something very special for you."
00:11:33.109,00:11:34.318,Huh?! Really?
00:11:34.402,00:11:39.323,Yep. It's made of ice cream. I knew that was your favorite.
00:11:39.407,00:11:42.868,"-Aw, we did it! -Happy Cupcake Day!"
00:11:47.915,00:11:50.501,"Happy Cupcake Day, mateys!"
00:00:47.380,00:00:49.966,Monkey with a tool belt.
00:00:57.515,00:01:01.061,"I'm Neil Ostrich, your beak on the street!"
00:01:01.144,00:01:08.359,"All of Blunderburg is gearing up for the annual Underwear Parade, where everyone wears their undies outside their clothes."
00:01:10.612,00:01:17.535,"As soon as Mayor Murphy arrives wearing the royal underwear, the parade will begin! Eh-oh!"
00:01:17.619,00:01:19.120,My microphone!
00:01:25.126,00:01:26.127,Huh?
00:01:26.211,00:01:29.005,"No, that's Chico Bon Bon, Neil."
00:01:29.089,00:01:31.007,Monkey with a tool belt.
00:01:31.091,00:01:33.510,Time to engineer a new microphone.
00:01:37.555,00:01:41.142,"There you go, the Mega Mic 8000."
00:01:41.226,00:01:43.311,"See you at the Underwear Parade, Neil."
00:01:43.394,00:01:46.272,"-Thanks, Chunko. -It's, uh, Chico."
00:01:47.941,00:01:50.860,"All right, Fix-It Force. The parade's about to begin."
00:01:50.944,00:01:53.363,Undies up! Rainbow Thunder!
00:01:53.822,00:01:55.824,How pow meow!
00:01:56.699,00:01:58.076,Tiny!
00:01:59.285,00:02:00.120,Clark!
00:02:00.954,00:02:01.913,Ah! Peanuts!
00:02:01.996,00:02:04.499,Whoa! Whoa! Ugh!
00:02:05.250,00:02:06.167,Here!
00:02:06.709,00:02:09.379,"Looking good, team! Snap test!"
00:02:09.462,00:02:11.214,Stretch...
00:02:11.798,00:02:12.757,and snap!
00:02:12.841,00:02:15.510,"Ooh, whoa, the sound of that snap!"
00:02:16.010,00:02:31.734,"Next stop, the Underwear Parade-- Chico Bon Bon! You got a problem? We can solve ‘em!"
00:02:32.318,00:02:36.531,"Chico Boom Boom! Oh, thank heavens. I have a real problem."
00:02:36.614,00:02:39.075,"Mayor Murphy? Oh, it's Chico Bon Bon."
00:02:39.159,00:02:41.369,Shouldn't you be getting ready for the parade?
00:02:41.452,00:02:45.290,"If you can't solve this, there won't be an Underwear Parade."
00:02:46.457,00:02:51.296,"Don't worry, Mayor Murphy. Fix-It Force, time to bring the awesome!"
00:02:54.841,00:02:56.885,Rainbow Thunder!
00:02:56.968,00:02:58.094,Clark!
00:03:05.852,00:03:07.020,Whoa! Ah!
00:03:10.398,00:03:11.232,Uh!
00:03:35.798,00:03:38.009,"Oh, thanks for coming, Mr. Bam Bam."
00:03:39.761,00:03:48.686,"As you know, the Underwear Parade can only begin with an appearance by the Mayor of Blunderburg, me, wearing these..."
00:03:51.606,00:03:53.816,The royal underwear.
00:03:53.900,00:03:57.278,"-So, what's the problem, Mayor? -See for yourself."
00:04:00.114,00:04:02.242,The royal underwear won't stay on!
00:04:03.576,00:04:06.371,"I pull them up, and they fall right down!"
00:04:08.122,00:04:13.461,"Oh, if I can't wear them, the Underwear Parade will have to be canceled."
00:04:13.544,00:04:16.547,Canceled? Ah...
00:04:16.631,00:04:18.800,Hold on. I think I see the problem.
00:04:18.883,00:04:25.390,"The waistband on the royal underwear has lost its-- its-- -Rainbow, what's that word again? -Elasticity!"
00:04:25.473,00:04:26.599,Elas-what-pa-pa?
00:04:26.683,00:04:28.184,Elasticity!
00:04:28.268,00:04:31.729,See when things stretch and then snap back into place?
00:04:31.813,00:04:35.066,It's called elasticity. Like a rubber band.
00:04:35.149,00:04:40.029,Or a hair tie. Or this slingshot here.
00:04:40.113,00:04:40.947,Tiny?
00:04:41.614,00:04:44.450,Just stretch and snap.
00:04:47.328,00:04:49.414,Yay! Elasticity!
00:04:49.497,00:04:56.004,"To make the royal underwear stay on, we'll need to engineer a new waistband with lots of elasticity."
00:04:56.087,00:04:57.380,"Clark, what have we got?"
00:04:57.463,00:04:59.841,"Well, we could try a rubber cord."
00:05:01.592,00:05:03.011,Too tight.
00:05:04.846,00:05:08.057,"Oh, or what about some peanut butter taffy?"
00:05:09.892,00:05:12.687,"Mmm, tasty. But droopy."
00:05:12.770,00:05:16.566,"Oh, what about an elastic band?"
00:05:18.484,00:05:21.237,Stretchy and snappy.
00:05:21.321,00:05:23.114,"Oh, stylish too."
00:05:23.197,00:05:25.825,I think we've found our new waistband material.
00:05:25.908,00:05:28.161,"Fix-It Force, let's get to work."
00:05:31.622,00:05:32.707,EZ Tweezies.
00:05:38.171,00:05:40.006,Removing the old waistband.
00:05:41.132,00:05:42.633,Elastic band.
00:05:44.635,00:05:46.179,"No, I can't look!"
00:05:52.310,00:05:53.770,"Chico, we're losing them!"
00:06:04.906,00:06:06.908,The underwear is stabilizing!
00:06:06.991,00:06:10.078,Phew! Underwear improvement complete.
00:06:16.501,00:06:17.877,Whoopsie!
00:06:21.130,00:06:22.840,No need to panic.
00:06:30.181,00:06:32.683,We'll have your underwear back in time for the parade.
00:06:32.767,00:06:35.353,That's a Chico Bon Bon promise.
00:06:35.436,00:06:38.856,"As for the rest of us, we've got some undies to catch."
00:06:38.940,00:06:40.691,Let's snap to it!
00:06:50.284,00:06:52.703,"Mr. Dunderhead, stop your truck!"
00:06:52.787,00:06:54.956,The royal underwear are on it!
00:07:01.504,00:07:02.880,"Clark, trunk me!"
00:07:04.215,00:07:05.216,You got it!
00:07:08.719,00:07:09.846,Whoa!
00:07:09.929,00:07:11.222,Chico!
00:07:11.973,00:07:13.683,Whoa!
00:07:14.934,00:07:15.935,Ah!
00:07:18.438,00:07:19.605,Ugh!
00:07:19.689,00:07:20.690,Whoa!
00:07:23.568,00:07:24.569,Oh.
00:07:31.742,00:07:32.618,Huh?
00:07:32.702,00:07:34.162,Sandwich coming through.
00:07:47.341,00:07:48.593,"Go, Tiny!"
00:08:06.903,00:08:08.237,Got you!
00:08:13.868,00:08:16.787,We've gotta unhook those undies before they rip in half!
00:08:16.871,00:08:19.540,"-Rainbow, how close can you get me? -Pretty close."
00:08:19.624,00:08:22.001,"Ooh, I can use that truck as a ramp!"
00:08:22.084,00:08:24.504,"I don't like that idea, Rainbow."
00:08:24.587,00:08:26.172,I love it!
00:08:26.255,00:08:27.298,Step on it!
00:08:27.381,00:08:28.883,Hold on to your whiskers!
00:08:48.778,00:08:49.737,Ooh.
00:08:51.155,00:08:54.992,"Wow! Chico, you saved the royal undies."
00:08:55.076,00:08:58.704,And you've got a category five wedgie.
00:08:58.788,00:09:00.873,"Ah, that's a personal best!"
00:09:04.877,00:09:07.588,Chico! Have you found the royal underwear?
00:09:07.672,00:09:10.383,"Sure have, Mayor Murphy. Got 'em right here."
00:09:10.466,00:09:15.555,"But I need them right here, right now. The parade is about to start!"
00:09:15.638,00:09:17.348,"Hang tight, we're on our way!"
00:09:18.474,00:09:21.018,"Okay, everybody, into Tool Force One!"
00:09:21.102,00:09:23.271,"If we hurry, we can get there just in time."
00:09:23.354,00:09:27.817,"-Well, that's gonna be hard. -No way. The Fix-It Force can do anything."
00:09:27.900,00:09:30.361,"No, I mean, that's gonna be hard."
00:09:30.861,00:09:32.905,Your vehicle's stuck in concrete.
00:09:38.661,00:09:41.163,"Oh, yep, it's stuck all right."
00:09:41.247,00:09:44.333,But now we'll never get the mayor the underwear in time.
00:09:44.417,00:09:50.006,"The parade will be canceled and-- Uh, Chico. I think you better take a banana break."
00:09:56.596,00:09:59.640,But Tool Force One is stuck. We need to snap to it.
00:09:59.724,00:10:00.975,Snap...
00:10:01.058,00:10:05.438,"Wait, maybe we can use elasticity. Rubber band?"
00:10:07.023,00:10:07.857,Hair tie?
00:10:11.986,00:10:14.071,"Blazing bananas, that's it!"
00:10:14.155,00:10:18.868,We can make a giant slingshot to launch me and the royal underwear to the parade.
00:10:18.951,00:10:21.120,"Rainbow, which way's the parade?"
00:10:24.624,00:10:26.792,"Clark, stretch me back."
00:10:26.876,00:10:27.877,You got it!
00:10:30.838,00:10:31.672,Snap!
00:10:32.548,00:10:35.384,Oo-oo-oo-oo-whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:10:35.468,00:10:38.971,"And now, the moment we've all been waiting for."
00:10:39.055,00:10:43.976,"Here's Mayor Murphy, kicking off the Underwear Parade in ten..."
00:10:45.686,00:10:46.771,"-Eight! -Oh, my."
00:10:48.564,00:10:50.316,-Here comes Chico Bing-Bong! -Five!
00:10:51.567,00:10:54.695,-Three! Two! One! -Where are those underwear?
00:10:55.863,00:10:57.657,"Right here, Mayor Murphy!"
00:10:57.740,00:10:58.866,Chico!
00:10:58.949,00:10:59.825,Undies up!
00:11:02.411,00:11:06.415,Let the Underwear Parade begin!
00:11:11.128,00:11:12.672,"Thank you, Chico."
00:11:15.549,00:11:19.011,Let's all hear it for Chico Bon Bon.
00:11:24.809,00:11:27.436,-Chico! -Bon Bon!
00:11:27.520,00:11:29.522,"Guys, you made it!"
00:11:32.566,00:11:34.443,We're the Fix-It Force!
00:11:34.527,00:11:37.196,Let's get this underwear party started.
00:11:37.279,00:11:39.615,"But first, snap test!"
00:00:47.380,00:00:49.799,Monkey with a tool belt!
00:00:55.513,00:01:03.021,"I scream, you scream, we all scream for… Ice cream?"
00:01:14.365,00:01:18.036,"Hmm… Oh, I think I see the problem, Mrs. Coleslaw."
00:01:18.119,00:01:21.164,There must be something wrong with Fridgey's insulation.
00:01:21.247,00:01:24.709,"Oh dear! His what, now?"
00:01:24.793,00:01:26.002,Insulation.
00:01:26.086,00:01:33.134,"Check it out. Fridgey Boo Boo's got a freezing machine to make ice cream, and this foam material is insulation."
00:01:33.218,00:01:36.054,It's what keeps the ice cream cold once it's made.
00:01:36.137,00:01:39.015,The foam insulation makes it hard for heat to get in.
00:01:39.099,00:01:41.768,That's why Fridgey can keep things cold.
00:01:41.851,00:01:44.854,Looks like Fridgey Boo Boo doesn't have enough insulation.
00:01:44.938,00:01:47.440,That's why the ice cream comes out melty.
00:01:51.027,00:01:54.864,Don't worry. I'll just add some more foam for better insulation.
00:01:56.324,00:02:00.703,There. Now you've got the perfect ice cream making machine.
00:02:00.787,00:02:02.122,"Go on, give it a try."
00:02:02.205,00:02:03.873,"Well, all right."
00:02:10.547,00:02:14.092,"Nice and cold, just the way I like it."
00:02:15.552,00:02:17.053,Insulation!
00:02:17.137,00:02:18.721,"Thank you, Chico."
00:02:22.851,00:02:23.977,The banana phone!
00:02:31.442,00:02:35.071,Has this ever happened to you?
00:02:35.155,00:02:41.536,You're enjoying a delicious ice cream treat when a giant monster grabs it right out of your hand?
00:02:42.412,00:02:44.372,"No, that's never happened to us."
00:02:46.374,00:02:49.586,"Actually, it has happened to us."
00:02:53.798,00:02:56.259,More ice cream!
00:02:56.342,00:02:59.429,That monster ate all of our ice cream!
00:02:59.512,00:03:01.890,And she's still hungry!
00:03:04.517,00:03:06.603,More ice cream!
00:03:06.686,00:03:09.189,Say no more. We're on our way!
00:03:09.272,00:03:15.069,"Fix-It Force, we need to feed that monster fast, or she'll destroy Blunderburg looking for more ice cream."
00:03:15.153,00:03:18.698,It's time to bring the ice cold awesome!
00:03:21.784,00:03:23.703,Rainbow Thunder!
00:03:24.495,00:03:25.496,Clark!
00:03:26.080,00:03:27.665,Tiny!
00:03:30.335,00:03:33.129,I'm Neil Ostrich here on the scene.
00:03:33.213,00:03:35.048,"Literally, on the scene."
00:03:35.131,00:03:41.554,There's a monster on the loose in Blunderburg and it's hungry for one thing: ice cream!
00:03:42.055,00:03:43.014,I don't-- Whoa!
00:03:43.097,00:03:45.266,More ice cream!
00:03:46.851,00:03:52.899,"Cones, sundaes, novelty treats… No form of ice cream is safe!"
00:03:52.982,00:03:57.028,Who can save the city from that ice-cream-craving creature?
00:03:58.655,00:04:00.907,More ice cream!
00:04:03.910,00:04:07.288,"I'm Chico Bon Bon, monkey with a tool belt!"
00:04:07.372,00:04:09.707,And we're the Fix-It Force!
00:04:09.791,00:04:12.502,And that's one big monster!
00:04:12.585,00:04:18.675,"Which means we need a monster-sized serving of ice cream to fill her tummy, so she'll never come after our ice cream again."
00:04:18.758,00:04:22.053,But Betty and I will never be able to make enough!
00:04:22.136,00:04:25.974,Then what we need is all the ice cream left in Blunderburg.
00:04:26.057,00:04:28.893,Operation Ice Cream begins now!
00:04:28.977,00:04:30.853,Our tastiest mission yet!
00:04:35.275,00:04:39.529,Mayor Murphy has declared a level-five ice cream emergency!
00:04:39.612,00:04:45.368,"Citizens of Blunderburg, the Fix-It Force needs your ice cream!"
00:04:47.453,00:04:48.621,"Thanks, Mayor!"
00:05:10.435,00:05:12.270,-All right! -So much ice cream!
00:05:13.646,00:05:16.107,Then it's time to feed the monster!
00:05:17.275,00:05:20.194,More ice cream!
00:05:26.659,00:05:27.744,What do you mean?
00:05:27.827,00:05:30.204,The ice cream's all melted!
00:05:34.000,00:05:36.544,No melty ice cream!
00:05:37.378,00:05:41.341,"Okay, so she really doesn't like melty ice cream."
00:05:41.424,00:05:46.804,We've gotta figure out a way to keep the ice cream cold long enough to feed that monster.
00:05:46.888,00:05:48.890,"Yeah, like with a freezer!"
00:05:48.973,00:05:52.226,But it would need to be a monster-sized freezer.
00:05:52.310,00:05:54.479,A monster-sized freezer!
00:05:54.979,00:05:56.647,"That's a great idea, Clark!"
00:05:56.731,00:05:59.609,"Rainbow, set a course to Mrs. Coleslaw's house."
00:06:01.194,00:06:03.780,"Chico, are you sure you wanna do this?"
00:06:03.863,00:06:08.326,Remember what happened the last time Fridgey Boo Boo transformed into Fridgebot?
00:06:08.409,00:06:10.912,"Oh, I remember!"
00:06:10.995,00:06:14.415,He went through town shooting ice cubes at everything!
00:06:14.499,00:06:17.251,"I know, but he's our only hope."
00:06:17.335,00:06:31.057,Now presenting… Now with ice cream blasting power!
00:06:33.726,00:06:35.103,Too melty!
00:06:42.068,00:06:45.238,And… we're good to go!
00:06:46.322,00:06:49.158,I even loaded up some new ice cream jokes.
00:06:49.242,00:06:52.078,Why do ice cream cones carry umbrellas?
00:06:52.161,00:06:53.329,Why?
00:06:53.413,00:06:56.124,Because there's always a chance of sprinkles!
00:07:01.337,00:07:03.339,More ice cream!
00:07:04.382,00:07:07.009,"The Ice Cream Monster, she's coming this way!"
00:07:07.093,00:07:08.761,"We've gotta feed her, fast!"
00:07:10.012,00:07:11.639,"Let's go, Fridgebot!"
00:07:16.227,00:07:23.234,"I'm reporting live from downtown Blunderburg, where the hungry Ice Cream Monster is still searching for ice cr-- Whoa!"
00:07:23.317,00:07:25.778,Nom? Ice cream?
00:07:25.862,00:07:27.029,Blech!
00:07:27.530,00:07:28.614,Blech!
00:07:29.282,00:07:31.659,More ice cream!
00:07:34.620,00:07:35.496,Nom?
00:07:35.580,00:07:40.251,"Okay, Fridgebot, do your thing! Ice cream blasters, go!"
00:07:54.557,00:07:56.934,Activate booster cannons!
00:08:03.941,00:08:07.570,How's about a little strawberry and some chocolate chip!
00:08:08.946,00:08:11.157,Ooh! Don't forget peanut butter!
00:08:11.240,00:08:12.909,And rainbow sprinkles!
00:08:26.214,00:08:27.882,She still wants more?
00:08:27.965,00:08:33.638,"I don't think she'll stop until she's totally full, and even Fridgebot can't feed her fast enough!"
00:08:33.721,00:08:34.847,"You're right, Rainbow."
00:08:34.931,00:08:39.393,We need to make her a super-sized bowl of ice cream so she can really chow down.
00:08:39.477,00:08:44.524,But where are we gonna find a bowl big enough to serve a giant monster?
00:08:58.871,00:09:00.748,"Fridgebot, fill it up!"
00:09:06.712,00:09:07.755,"Now, mint!"
00:09:09.549,00:09:10.967,"Now, vanilla!"
00:09:11.801,00:09:13.427,"Now, blunderberry!"
00:09:25.147,00:09:28.276,Whoa-ho-ho! That ought to be enough for the monster!
00:09:28.359,00:09:29.694,Uh… guys!
00:09:29.777,00:09:32.863,The ice cream is already melting! We gotta keep it cold!
00:09:32.947,00:09:36.617,We spent all this time collecting the ice cream and now it's going to melt!
00:09:36.701,00:09:42.123,We have to figure out how to keep the Blunderdome cold enough to keep it from melting. What if it doesn't work?
00:09:42.206,00:09:45.960,Chico? Maybe now's a good time for a banana break.
00:09:55.553,00:09:58.389,Fridgey Boo Boo can only keep it cold when it's inside him.
00:10:00.600,00:10:02.560,Because there's no insulation.
00:10:03.728,00:10:05.187,Insulation!
00:10:06.981,00:10:11.944,"Blazing bananas, that's it! We need insulation."
00:10:13.070,00:10:17.116,"If we insulate the entire Blunderdome, we can keep the ice cream cold."
00:10:18.492,00:10:23.331,"Rainbow, activate foam cannon and prepare to insulate."
00:10:33.007,00:10:35.301,"Folks, I can't believe what I'm seeing."
00:10:35.384,00:10:39.347,The Fix-It Force are insulating the Blunderdome with foam!
00:10:46.145,00:10:47.313,-We did it! -Yeah!
00:10:50.358,00:10:51.400,Nom!
00:10:51.484,00:10:54.153,It's an insulation sensation!
00:10:54.236,00:10:56.238,Nom!
00:11:05.998,00:11:08.209,All full!
00:11:10.586,00:11:12.380,Bye-bye!
00:11:13.547,00:11:15.758,"We saved the city, Fridgebot."
00:11:20.179,00:11:30.981,"Now there's only one thing left to do… Mmm! Thanks for the ice cream, Chico."
00:11:31.065,00:11:34.985,"The Ice Cream Monster's gone for good! Thank you, Chico."
00:11:35.069,00:11:37.613,We couldn't have done it without Fridgey Boo Boo here.
00:11:37.697,00:11:41.283,"Oh! I love you, Fridgey Boo Boo!"
00:11:41.367,00:11:44.120,What is ice cream's favorite day of the week?
00:11:46.997,00:11:47.998,Sunday!
00:11:48.082,00:11:49.792,"Oh, Fridgey Boo Boo!"
