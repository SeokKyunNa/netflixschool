00:00:12.429,00:00:16.600,BUT THAT ALL ENDS THIS SATURDAY!
00:00:16.600,00:00:27.945,"BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THIS TEAM, MY WARRIORS, ARE GONNA BURN THOSE PANSY-ASS OHIO PLAYERS RIGHT TO THE GROUND!"
00:00:36.912,00:00:38.789,Connor: AND STOP ACTING LIKE A LITTLE BITCH BABY.
00:00:38.789,00:00:40.040,DO NOT TELL ME HOW TO FEEL RIGHT NOW!
00:00:40.040,00:00:41.750,HEY.
00:00:41.750,00:00:43.084,SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.
00:00:43.084,00:00:45.504,I WENT BACK FOR THIS.
00:00:45.504,00:00:48.007,"NOW, YOU -- YOU TAKE THAT BACK RIGHT NOW!"
00:00:48.007,00:00:49.800,NO. IT'S SMART.
00:00:49.800,00:00:55.931,COMMONWEALTH v. DELOATCHE -- A CASE THE PROSECUTION SHOULD'VE WON BUT LOST BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MURDER WEAPON.
00:00:55.931,00:00:57.933,"SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?"
00:00:57.933,00:00:59.852,HIDE IT IN PLAIN SIGHT.
00:00:59.852,00:01:02.354,AFTER WE BURY THE BODY.
00:01:02.354,00:01:04.356,"NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT."
00:01:04.356,00:01:06.316,"YEAH, I-I-I-I'M WITH MICHAELA."
00:01:06.316,00:01:08.151,"NO, CONNOR, THINK."
00:01:08.151,00:01:10.404,"THE TROPHY WE NEED, YES."
00:01:10.404,00:01:12.531,"NO, THE BODY IS WHAT GETS US CAUGHT."
00:01:12.531,00:01:14.867,YOU ARE NOT THINKING STRAIGHT.
00:01:14.867,00:01:18.161,SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE CARRYING A BODY ACROSS CAMPUS ON THE BUSIEST NIGHT OF THE YEAR!
00:01:18.161,00:01:19.663,"Connor: SHE'S RIGHT, LAUREL."
00:01:19.663,00:01:24.043,"EVEN IF WE GET IT OUT OF THE HOUSE, UNSEEN, THE GROUND IS FROZEN!"
00:01:24.043,00:01:26.085,YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
00:01:26.085,00:01:27.963,THIS IS MURDER! NONE OF US KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT!
00:01:27.963,00:01:29.673,JUST YELL THAT A LITTLE LOUDER!
00:01:29.673,00:01:30.966,"HONESTLY, YOU'RE ALL DUMBER THAN I THOUGHT IF YOU THINK..."
00:01:30.966,00:01:34.469,"LOOK, I'M AGREEING WITH YOU -- YOU TWO NEED TO MAN UP AND THINK BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO JAIL."
00:01:36.137,00:01:38.891,SHUT UP!
00:01:38.891,00:01:41.810,IT'S TWO AGAINST TWO.
00:01:41.810,00:01:44.354,WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.
00:01:44.354,00:01:46.815,THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING YOU'VE EVER SAID.
00:01:46.815,00:01:49.276,I'M NOT LETTING A FREAKING COIN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT I GO TO JAIL TONIGHT!
00:01:49.276,00:01:50.819,WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO FIGHT!
00:01:50.819,00:01:52.821,WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION AND COMMIT TO IT.
00:01:52.821,00:01:54.949,"SO IF SOMEONE HAS A BETTER IDEA, SAY IT NOW!"
00:01:58.744,00:02:01.872,"HEADS, WE GET THE BODY."
00:02:01.872,00:02:04.165,"TAILS, WE LEAVE IT WHERE IT IS. OKAY?"
00:02:56.677,00:02:59.429,I THREW UP FOUR TIMES THIS MORNING WORRIED SHE'S GONNA CALL ON ME.
00:02:59.429,00:03:05.102,"YEAH, SHE'S A BALLBUSTER, SURE, BUT I SPENT MY SUMMER INTERNING FOR CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, SO I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE A BIG PERSONALITY."
00:03:05.102,00:03:08.355,"DERSHOWITZ HAS THE UPPER HAND IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD, BUT KEATING'S CLEARLY THE BETTER DEFENSE ATTORNEY."
00:03:11.232,00:03:14.486,HERE WE GO.
00:03:14.486,00:03:18.824,"I'M NOT USUALLY A FIRST-ROW KIND OF GUY, BUT I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULDN'T HIDE IN THE BACK OF THE CLASS."
00:03:18.824,00:03:20.159,I'M ENGAGED.
00:03:20.159,00:03:23.120,"OH. OH, NO."
00:03:23.120,00:03:25.789,SEATS ARE ASSIGNED.
00:03:28.291,00:03:30.169,"NICE TRY, PLAYER."
00:03:30.169,00:03:32.420,NO. I WASN'T TRYING ANYTHING...
00:03:32.420,00:03:34.798,YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A SITTING DUCK WHEN THE SHOOTER GETS HERE.
00:03:34.798,00:03:36.341,WHAT?
00:03:36.341,00:03:38.218,"OH, MY GOD. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST WALKED INTO."
00:03:38.218,00:03:40.095,Annalise: GOOD MORNING.
00:03:40.095,00:03:47.519,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT TERRIBLE THINGS YOU'VE DONE IN YOUR LIFE UP TO THIS POINT, BUT CLEARLY YOUR KARMA'S OUT OF BALANCE TO GET ASSIGNED TO MY CLASS."
00:03:47.519,00:03:51.190,"I'M PROFESSOR ANNALISE KEATING, AND THIS IS CRIMINAL LAW 100."
00:03:51.190,00:03:54.068,"OR, AS I PREFER TO CALL IT..."
00:04:02.617,00:04:06.038,...HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER.
00:04:09.875,00:04:21.887,"UNLIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES, I WILL NOT BE TEACHING YOU HOW TO STUDY THE LAW OR THEORIZE ABOUT IT, BUT RATHER HOW TO PRACTICE IT -- IN A COURTROOM, LIKE A REAL LAWYER."
00:04:21.887,00:04:26.266,"NOW TO OUR FIRST CASE STUDY, THE ASPIRIN ASSASSIN."
00:04:26.266,00:04:28.060,TELL US THE FACTS...
00:04:29.603,00:04:31.855,...CONNOR WALSH.
00:04:31.855,00:04:36.359,THE COMMONWEALTH v. GINA SADOWSKI WAS A CASE OF ATTEMPTED MURDER.
00:04:36.359,00:04:43.117,"THE DEFENDANT, MS. SADOWSKI, WORKED AS THE SECOND ASSISTANT TO THE VICTIM, ARTHUR KAUFMAN, THE C.E.O."
00:04:43.117,00:04:45.452,"MS. SADOWSKI WAS NOT ONLY HIS ASSISTANT, THOUGH."
00:04:45.452,00:04:47.328,SHE WAS ALSO HIS MISTRESS.
00:04:47.328,00:04:51.875,"WHAT HAPPENED AFTER MR. KAUFMAN'S WIFE OF 27 YEARS, AGNES, FOUND OUT ABOUT THE AFFAIR?"
00:04:51.875,00:04:54.169,YOU.
00:04:54.169,00:04:57.965,HE ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP AND TRANSFERRED HER TO THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT.
00:04:57.965,00:05:03.386,"THAT'S WHEN SHE ALLEGEDLY SWITCHED ONE OF HIS BLOOD PRESSURE PILLS FOR AN ASPIRIN, WHICH SHE KNEW HE WAS ALLERGIC TO."
00:05:03.386,00:05:05.764,WHAT OCCURRED WHEN MR. KAUFMAN INGESTED THE ASPIRIN?
00:05:05.764,00:05:07.015,ANYONE?
00:05:09.768,00:05:12.520,MR. KAUFMAN WENT INTO ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK.
00:05:12.520,00:05:17.943,HIS THROAT SWELLED AND HIS BRAIN WAS DEPRIVED OF OXYGEN FOR 7 MINUTES BEFORE HIS FIRST ASSISTANT WAS ABLE TO RESUSCITATE HIM.
00:05:17.943,00:05:19.694,MICHAELA PRATT.
00:05:19.694,00:05:22.114,"SO, WE'VE ESTABLISHED THE ACTUS REUS."
00:05:22.114,00:05:24.866,WHAT WAS THE MENS REA?
00:05:24.866,00:05:26.785,WESLEY GIBBINS?
00:05:28.829,00:05:32.916,THE...MENS REA?
00:05:32.916,00:05:34.542,RIGHT.
00:05:35.794,00:05:39.338,DAY 1 AND YOU'RE UNPREPARED?
00:05:39.338,00:05:42.843,"WELL, UM, YES, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS ANYTHING TO PREPARE."
00:05:42.843,00:05:46.972,I E-MAILED THE ASSIGNMENT TO THE ENTIRE CLASS TWO DAYS AGO.
00:05:46.972,00:05:49.348,OH.
00:05:51.310,00:06:03.864,"MR. GIBBINS, AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY, I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME AROUND PROFESSIONAL LIARS, SO YOU HAVE TO WORK REALLY HARD TO FOOL ME."
00:06:05.240,00:06:09.828,I ONLY GOT ACCEPTED HERE TWO DAYS AGO...
00:06:09.828,00:06:16.043,"FROM THE WAIT LIST, SO THAT'S PROBABLY WHY YOU DIDN'T GET MY E-MAIL ADDRESS."
00:06:17.127,00:06:18.753,LET ME HELP YOU OUT.
00:06:18.753,00:06:27.512,ACTUS REUS MEANS GUILTY ACT -- THE POISONING OF MR. KAUFMAN WITH AN ASPIRIN -- WHEREAS MENS REA MEANS GUILTY MIND.
00:06:27.512,00:06:30.431,SO WHAT WAS MS. SADOWSKI'S MENS REA?
00:06:32.391,00:06:34.144,"THINK, MR. GIBBINS."
00:06:34.144,00:06:37.856,IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN COMMON SENSE.
00:06:40.650,00:06:41.818,Laurel: TO KILL.
00:06:44.738,00:06:48.407,WILL THE INDIVIDUAL WHO JUST SPOKE PLEASE STAND AND REPEAT THE ANSWER?
00:06:50.618,00:06:55.414,"THE MENS REA, ALSO REFERRED TO AS INTENT, WAS TO KILL MR. KAUFMAN."
00:06:55.414,00:06:57.251,THAT'S RIGHT.
00:06:57.251,00:06:59.711,LAUREL CASTILLO.
00:07:01.338,00:07:07.552,"NEVER TAKE A LEARNING OPPORTUNITY AWAY FROM ANOTHER STUDENT, NO MATTER HOW SMART YOU NEED EVERYONE TO THINK YOU ARE."
00:07:09.930,00:07:14.268,"ALL RIGHT, BEFORE WE MOVE ON, ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?"
00:07:14.268,00:07:16.644,MR. WALSH.
00:07:16.644,00:07:18.355,I NOTICED THAT THE VERDICT WASN'T LISTED HERE.
00:07:18.355,00:07:22.609,"SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS, DID SHE DO IT?"
00:07:22.609,00:07:25.028,WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER YOURSELF?
00:07:25.028,00:07:31.451,I LIED. THIS ISN'T A PAST CASE BUT ONE I TOOK LAST WEEK AFTER GINA FIRED HER PREVIOUS LAWYER.
00:07:31.451,00:07:40.001,"THIS ONE DAY, I WALKED INTO HIS OFFICE WHEN I JUST SCREAMED, REAL LOUD, 'CAUSE ARTHUR WAS STANDING THERE BEHIND THE DOOR."
00:07:40.001,00:07:45.632,"GONNA BE PISSED AT ME, YELL, BUT INSTEAD HE JUST STARTED LAUGHIN'."
00:07:45.632,00:07:51.638,"SO THEN I STARTED LAUGHIN' AND, WELL, UM, THAT'S WHEN HE KISSED ME FOR THE FIRST TIME AND..."
00:07:51.638,00:07:54.557,"YEAH, I BECAME THAT GIRL."
00:07:54.557,00:07:56.601,SOMETHING TELLS ME SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN THAT GIRL.
00:07:56.601,00:08:04.484,IT WAS ON MY LAST DAY WORKIN' FOR HIM WHEN I CAME BACK FROM LUNCH AND SAW THE PARAMEDICS.
00:08:04.484,00:08:07.737,WHEN I HEARD THAT ARTHUR WAS HURT...
00:08:07.737,00:08:09.323,I LOVED HIM.
00:08:09.323,00:08:13.994,"I KNOW THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT I LOVED HIM."
00:08:13.994,00:08:17.456,HELL WOULD I WANT TO HURT HIM?
00:08:17.456,00:08:24.379,"Annalise: THE TRIAL BEGINS IN TWO DAYS, SO TOMORROW, EACH OF YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO PRESENT THE BEST DEFENSE FOR THIS CASE."
00:08:24.379,00:08:26.714,SEE IF YOU CAN BEAT MY CURRENT PLAN.
00:08:26.714,00:08:29.259,MR. GIBBINS?
00:08:29.259,00:08:35.849,"YOU'LL GO LAST, AN UNENVIABLE POSITION SEEING THAT NO TWO STUDENTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO PRESENT THE SAME IDEA."
00:08:35.849,00:08:44.274,"USE THE RESOURCES IN THIS OFFICE -- GINA'S DISCOVERY FILE, MY LIBRARY, THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME EVEN BETTER THAN MYSELF -- MY ASSOCIATES."
00:08:44.274,00:08:48.611,"NAME'S FRANK, AND UNLIKE EVERY TEACHER YOU'VE HAD, I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE STUPID QUESTIONS."
00:08:48.611,00:08:52.740,"SO IF YOU GOT 'EM, PLEASE SEE MY LOVELY COLLEAGUE BONNIE."
00:08:52.740,00:08:55.869,"OR, BETTER, YOU COULD COME TO US WITH ANSWERS."
00:08:55.869,00:08:58.163,WE'LL LIKE YOU MUCH BETTER THAT WAY.
00:08:58.163,00:08:59.789,AND ONE MORE THING.
00:08:59.789,00:09:01.916,EVERY YEAR I CHOOSE FOUR STUDENTS TO COME WORK FOR ME.
00:09:01.916,00:09:04.669,THIS ASSIGNMENT IS USED TO HELP ME DECIDE WHO THAT IS.
00:09:04.669,00:09:07.422,THE TOP STUDENT GETS THIS.
00:09:10.091,00:09:14.054,CONSIDER THIS YOUR IMMUNITY IDOL.
00:09:14.054,00:09:16.264,YOU -- YOU TAKE THAT BACK RIGHT NOW!
00:09:16.264,00:09:22.145,THE WINNER CAN TURN THIS IN AT ANY POINT TO GET OUT OF AN EXAM.
00:09:22.145,00:09:24.605,FIND A DEFENSE THAT WILL FREE OUR CLIENT.
00:09:28.943,00:09:32.280,THE FIRST ASSISTANT SAW GINA WITH AN ASPIRIN THAT MORNING.
00:09:32.280,00:09:34.866,FORENSICS FOUND ASPIRIN RESIDUE ON THE PLATE.
00:09:34.866,00:09:40.788,"SHE WAS WARNED ABOUT THE ALLERGY FIRST DAY ON THE JOB, WHICH MEANS WE SHOULD ARGUE..."
00:09:40.788,00:09:42.874,WHICH MEANS WE SHOULD ARGUE...
00:09:42.874,00:09:45.043,WE SHOULD ARGUE...
00:09:45.043,00:09:47.712,SHE'S GUILTY.
00:09:59.974,00:10:02.394,HI. WES.
00:10:02.394,00:10:04.521,I JUST MOVED IN NEXT DOOR.
00:10:04.521,00:10:06.398,WHAT DO YOU WANT?
00:10:06.398,00:10:11.445,I NORMALLY WOULDN'T ASK TO TURN IT DOWN BUT TODAY WAS MY FIRST DAY OF LAW SCHOOL -- NO.
00:10:11.445,00:10:12.987,THE LAST GUY WHO LIVED IN YOUR APARTMENT WAS A LAW STUDENT.
00:10:12.987,00:10:15.782,"I PUT UP WITH HIS CRAZY-LOUD RABBIT SEX, HIS NERVOUS BREAKDOWN."
00:10:15.782,00:10:16.824,YOU CAN DEAL WITH THIS.
00:10:16.824,00:10:17.992,"UH, UH..."
00:10:47.730,00:10:49.816,Connor: MICHAELA.
00:10:49.816,00:10:55.947,"THE COIN DID, SO I'M GONNA STAND HERE AND NOT SEE ANYTHING SO WHEN I'M CALLED TO TESTIFY, I CAN SAY JUST THAT."
00:10:55.947,00:10:58.199,I JUST WANT YOU TO MOVE YOUR FEET.
00:10:58.199,00:11:00.660,WHAT?
00:11:00.660,00:11:02.245,HERE.
00:11:02.245,00:11:05.499,I WIPED THE SINK DOWN WITH BLEACH AFTER I WASHED IT.
00:11:05.499,00:11:07.375,NOW WHAT?
00:11:07.375,00:11:09.836,WE PUT IT BACK.
00:11:09.836,00:11:11.712,Connor: LET'S JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. NOW.
00:11:13.632,00:11:15.091,I'LL HELP.
00:11:27.145,00:11:28.813,FINE.
00:11:35.612,00:11:37.822,WHOA.
00:11:37.822,00:11:39.740,COME OUT HERE.
00:11:51.127,00:11:53.505,Officer: THIS CAR ONE OF YOURS?
00:12:05.850,00:12:08.520,"IT'S MY CAR, SIR."
00:12:08.520,00:12:12.524,"OH. UH, RIGHT. I CAN -- I CAN MOVE IT RIGHT NOW."
00:12:12.524,00:12:14.401,THIS THAT LAW PROFESSOR'S OFFICE?
00:12:17.237,00:12:19.364,YES.
00:12:19.364,00:12:24.536,"WE'RE HER LAW STUDENTS, BUT SHE'S OUT OF TOWN AND TOLD US TO TAKE THIS OLD RUG TO THE BONFIRE."
00:12:24.536,00:12:26.829,SHE ASKED YOU TO GO INTO HER HOUSE AND BURN A RUG FOR HER?
00:12:26.829,00:12:29.123,"IT SOUNDS WEIRD, I KNOW."
00:12:29.123,00:12:31.418,WHY DON'T I GIVE HER A CALL SO SHE CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU HERSELF?
00:12:31.418,00:12:34.713,"UH...IT'S A LITTLE LATE TO CALL HER, DON'T YOU THINK?"
00:12:34.713,00:12:38.258,THE NICE OFFICER HERE THINKS WE'RE BURGLING OUR PROFESSOR'S HOUSE.
00:12:38.258,00:12:41.969,RIGHT.
00:12:41.969,00:12:43.846,"I MEAN, IT IS A LITTLE LATE."
00:12:43.846,00:12:45.764,"OH, GOD, AND SHE HAD TO GO TO HER MOTHER'S FUNERAL TODAY."
00:12:45.764,00:12:47.601,BUT MAYBE SHE'S NOT ASLEEP YET.
00:12:47.601,00:12:49.477,Man: THIS'LL BURN GOOD!
00:12:47.601,00:12:51.438,IT'S FINE. JUST -- DAMN IT.
00:12:51.438,00:12:53.189,"BE SAFE, OKAY? THERE'S A TON OF CRAZIES OUT TONIGHT."
00:12:57.569,00:13:00.779,WHERE THE HELL HAS THAT GIRL BEEN ALL NIGHT?
00:13:03.366,00:13:08.204,"WE SHOULD OFFER THE JURY ANOTHER SUSPECT ALTOGETHER -- MR. KAUFMAN'S WIFE, AGNES."
00:13:08.204,00:13:13.501,"SHE WAS ANGRY ABOUT THE AFFAIR, HAD ACCESS TO HIS OFFICE, AND KNEW WHAT ASPIRIN LOOKED LIKE HIS BLOOD PRESSURE PILL."
00:13:13.501,00:13:19.424,SO WHAT BETTER WAY TO GET REVENGE THAN TO KILL YOUR CHEATING HUSBAND AND PIN IT ON HIS MISTRESS?
00:13:20.592,00:13:22.552,THANK YOU.
00:13:27.056,00:13:28.516,"TAKE A SEAT, MS. PRATT."
00:13:28.516,00:13:31.144,YOU'VE MOVED ON TO THE NEXT ROUND.
00:13:31.144,00:13:32.853,WHO'S NEXT?
00:13:32.853,00:13:40.361,Asher: IT ALL COMES DOWN TO A SIMPLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE -- THAT THE DOCTOR CLAIMS HE RAN MR. KAUFMAN'S BLOOD WORK TOO LATE TO FIND ANY ASPIRIN IN HIS BLOOD.
00:13:40.361,00:13:45.366,A STATISTICAL BREAKDOWN OF THE JURY POOL SHOWS 80% OF THEM COME FROM A LOW SOCIOECONOMIC CLASS.
00:13:45.366,00:13:48.578,"YES, GINA PUT THE PILL ON HIS DESK, BUT DID SHE HAVE THE INTENT TO KILL?"
00:13:48.578,00:13:51.998,OUR CLIENT MISTOOK THE ASPIRIN AS HIS BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION...
00:13:51.998,00:13:55.752,THE ISSUES AT PLAY ARE COMPLICATED AND IN NEED OF MORE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH...
00:13:55.752,00:14:00.590,"SO WITHOUT A WITNESS TO ASSURE THAT, UM..."
00:14:00.590,00:14:04.385,"DO WE REALLY TRUST THIS DOCTOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY?"
00:14:04.385,00:14:06.429,OR DID SHE SIMPLY WANT TO GIVE HIM A SCARE?
00:14:06.429,00:14:09.015,"IPSO FACTO, THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE OF..."
00:14:09.015,00:14:11.017,DIMINISHED CAPACITY...
00:14:11.017,00:14:12.686,AN ACCIDENT...
00:14:12.686,00:14:15.188,"UM, WHERE'S GINA?"
00:14:12.686,00:14:17.357,GINA'S ONE OF THEM WHILE MR. KAUFMAN REPRESENTS THE WEALTHY AND OUT OF TOUCH.
00:14:17.357,00:14:19.567,"ATTEMPTED MURDER, THEREFORE, IS A BOGUS, INACCURATE CHARGE."
00:14:19.567,00:14:21.528,WE D-- WE DON'T KNOW WHERE GINA WAS.
00:14:21.528,00:14:23.571,I THINK NOT!
00:14:23.571,00:14:24.739,"I THINK NOT, INDEED!"
00:14:28.451,00:14:31.162,Annalise: MR. GIBBINS?
00:14:31.162,00:14:32.706,RIGHT.
00:14:35.625,00:14:41.548,"SO, THE WAY I SEE IT IS..."
00:14:41.548,00:14:43.424,WE SAY IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.
00:14:44.551,00:14:54.561,"AND WE DO THAT BECAUSE, WELL, GINA WAS SUFFERING FROM STOCKHOLM SYNDROME, WHICH IS ACTUALLY QUITE COMMON IN ASSISTANTS WITH DEMANDING BOSSES."
00:14:54.561,00:15:00.358,THE AFFAIR WAS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW FAR MR. KAUFMAN'S BRAINWASHING OF GINA WENT.
00:15:00.358,00:15:02.861,HE MADE HER FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM.
00:15:02.861,00:15:07.490,"SO IN THIS WAY, HER POISONING HIM WAS AN ACT OF SELF-DEFENSE."
00:15:09.950,00:15:14.497,AND I'LL JUST GO STAND OVER THERE.
00:15:14.497,00:15:17.291,NO. SIT.
00:15:20.587,00:15:23.964,CONGRATULATIONS TO THOSE WHO MANAGED TO KEEP YOUR SEAT.
00:15:23.964,00:15:29.470,"THAT SAID, NONE OF YOU BEAT MY APPROACH, WHICH GOES AS FOLLOWS."
00:15:29.470,00:15:33.767,STEP 1...
00:15:33.767,00:15:38.396,"STEP 2, INTRODUCE A NEW SUSPECT."
00:15:38.396,00:15:43.401,"THAT PERSON IS MR. KAUFMAN'S JEALOUS BUSINESS PARTNER, LIONEL BRYANT."
00:15:43.401,00:15:47.530,"STEP 3, WE BURY THE EVIDENCE."
00:15:47.530,00:15:55.663,WE THROW SO MUCH INFORMATION AT THE JURY THAT THEY WALK INTO THE DELIBERATION ROOM WITH ONE OVERWHELMING FEELING -- DOUBT.
00:15:55.663,00:15:59.584,THAT'S HOW YOU GET AWAY WITH MURDER.
00:15:59.584,00:16:01.586,SEE YOU IN THE COURTHOUSE AT 9:00.
00:16:01.586,00:16:03.630,"Michaela: OH, UM, PROFESSOR KEATING!"
00:16:03.630,00:16:09.636,"WE HAVE TORTS AT 9:00 TOMORROW, THEN PROPERTY AT 11:00, SO I'M NOT SURE -- THE WAY YOU'RE WHINING RIGHT NOW MAKES ME BELIEVE YOU THINK I'M YOUR MOTHER, MS. PRATT."
00:16:09.636,00:16:11.930,SHOW UP TOMORROW OR DROP OUT OF THE COMPETITION.
00:16:11.930,00:16:13.556,IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
00:16:16.392,00:16:25.067,"Tanner: I WAS HIS FIRST ASSISTANT FOR 21 YEARS, SO TO SEE HIM ON HIS OFFICE FLOOR LIKE THAT, IT WAS SO AWFUL."
00:16:25.067,00:16:27.361,HE WASN'T BREATHING.
00:16:27.361,00:16:30.782,AND HIS SKIN KEPT GETTING MORE AND MORE BLUE.
00:16:30.782,00:16:34.201,"I'M SORRY, AGNES."
00:16:34.201,00:16:36.704,"Williams: YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD, MS. TANNER."
00:16:39.540,00:16:42.084,WE JUST GOT SCREWED.
00:16:42.084,00:16:43.628,"YOU DON'T LIKE GINA, DO YOU?"
00:16:43.628,00:16:47.089,"YOU WOULD YELL AT HER, CALLING HER..."
00:16:47.089,00:16:49.968,"INCOMPETENT, STUPID, PODUNK TRAILER TRASH?"
00:16:49.968,00:16:51.511,NO. THAT'S A...
00:16:57.976,00:17:01.061,"CAN I HAVE A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR?"
00:17:02.146,00:17:03.815,WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
00:17:05.608,00:17:08.027,"WELL, NOW WE KNOW WHO'S THE FIRST TO FLAME OUT."
00:17:08.027,00:17:10.363,"HURRY IT ALONG, MS. KEATING."
00:17:13.574,00:17:15.117,WHAT WAS THAT?
00:17:15.117,00:17:16.828,SOMETHING THEY TAUGHT YOU IN TORTS?
00:17:16.828,00:17:18.788,YOU SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTION.
00:17:18.788,00:17:20.247,YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING.
00:17:20.247,00:17:27.380,"Annalise: MS. TANNER, YOU TESTIFIED THAT YOU SAW A PILL ON MY CLIENT'S DESK ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, CORRECT?"
00:17:27.380,00:17:28.798,YES.
00:17:28.798,00:17:33.219,"AND YOU SAID IT WAS A YELLOW PILL, SIMILAR TO PROSECUTOR WILLIAMS' SHIRT?"
00:17:33.219,00:17:34.303,YES.
00:17:36.514,00:17:40.852,"PROSECUTOR WILLIAMS' SHIRT IS BLUE, MS. TANNER."
00:17:40.852,00:17:42.186,ARE YOU COLOR-BLIND?
00:17:42.186,00:17:44.647,YES.
00:17:44.647,00:17:47.149,BUT I KNOW WHAT I SAW THAT MORNING.
00:17:47.149,00:17:48.902,I SEE.
00:17:48.902,00:18:01.789,"SO WHETHER THE PILL THAT YOU SAW ON MY CLIENT'S DESK WAS BLUE, LIKE HER ANXIETY MEDICATION SHE USED TO ENDURE WORKING UNDER YOU, OR YELLOW, LIKE THE ASPIRIN USED TO POISON MR. KAUFMAN, IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN TELL US?"
00:18:01.789,00:18:05.459,"I TOLD YOU, GINA WAS ACTING NERVOUS, LIKE -- IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION."
00:18:05.459,00:18:11.424,IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE PILL THAT YOU SAW ON GINA'S DESK WAS HER ANXIETY MEDICATION?
00:18:11.424,00:18:12.926,I GUESS SO.
00:18:12.926,00:18:14.928,THANK YOU FOR YOUR CANDOR.
00:18:14.928,00:18:26.689,"Michaela: I SAW SHE WAS WEARING GLASSES IN ONE OF HER FACEBOOK PHOTOS, WHICH GOT ME WONDERING ABOUT HER EYESIGHT, SO I CALLED EVERY OPTOMETRIST COVERED UNDER HER INSURANCE, FOUND HERS, THEN PRETENDED TO BE A CLAIMS PROVIDER TO GET THE RECEPTIONIST TO ADMIT SHE HAS A CONDITION CALLED ACHROMATOPSIA."
00:18:26.689,00:18:28.066,IT CAUSES COLOR BLINDNESS.
00:18:28.066,00:18:30.359,STEP 1 -- DISCREDIT THE WITNESS.
00:18:30.359,00:18:33.362,"I MIGHT AS WELL HAND YOU THE TROPHY RIGHT NOW, MS. PRATT."
00:18:33.362,00:18:35.073,BUT I WON'T.
00:18:35.073,00:18:37.784,NOT UNTIL I SEE HOW THE REST OF YOU STEP UP YOUR GAME.
00:18:45.207,00:18:49.045,"Woman: AND IN OTHER NEWS, THE SEARCH CONTINUES FOR LILA STANGARD."
00:18:49.045,00:18:59.388,"MS. STANGARD, A 21-YEAR-OLD STUDENT OF THE PHILADELPHIA UNIVERSITY, HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE FRIENDS SAW HER LEAVING A FRATERNITY PARTY EARLIER THIS WEEK."
00:19:14.779,00:19:16.405,"OH, MY GOD."
00:19:28.167,00:19:31.295,HELLO?
00:19:33.798,00:19:34.966,PROFESSOR KEATING?
00:19:34.966,00:19:38.260,Annalise: DON'T EVEN TRY.
00:19:44.934,00:19:47.770,PROFESSOR?
00:19:47.770,00:19:48.855,"OH, MY GOD."
00:19:48.855,00:19:51.024,GET THE HELL OUT!
00:19:54.276,00:19:55.319,HEY!
00:19:55.319,00:19:57.237,I'M SO SORRY.
00:19:57.237,00:19:59.532,TH-THE DOOR WAS OPEN.
00:20:01.200,00:20:02.326,WHY ARE YOU HERE?
00:20:02.326,00:20:03.828,IT CAN WAIT.
00:20:03.828,00:20:06.831,"FRANK, YOU DIDN'T LOCK UP AGAIN."
00:20:09.125,00:20:10.584,SPEAK.
00:20:10.584,00:20:18.425,I-I-I CAME ACROSS THIS CASE -- COMMONWEALTH v. McGINNIS -- WHICH SAYS WE CAN MOVE FOR A FASTER VERDICT IF WE THINK THE PROSECUTION'S EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT.
00:20:18.425,00:20:20.011,WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS CALLED A DIRECTED VERDICT.
00:20:20.011,00:20:23.931,"IF WE ASK FOR IT AND GET DENIED, ALL THE PUBLIC WILL HEAR IS THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONVICT."
00:20:23.931,00:20:28.102,BUT YOU DISCREDITED THE FIRST ASSISTANT TODAY AND -- YOU HAD AN IDEA.
00:20:28.102,00:20:29.896,"GOOD NIGHT, SETH."
00:20:29.896,00:20:31.856,WES.
00:20:31.856,00:20:33.440,RIGHT.
00:20:45.828,00:20:47.997,"CONNOR, PLEASE STOP."
00:20:50.541,00:20:53.836,"NO. I LIKE IT, ESPECIALLY THAT IT ANNOYS YOU."
00:21:01.010,00:21:03.096,Laurel: WHAT'S ALL THIS FOR?
00:21:03.096,00:21:05.431,I FIGURED I SHOULD BUY OTHER STUFF IN CASE I'M ON THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.
00:21:05.431,00:21:07.100,"WHY? WE CAN JUST KILL THE STORE OWNER IF WE NEED TO, RIGHT?"
00:21:21.363,00:21:25.409,"MAKER'S MANHATTAN, TWO CHERRIES."
00:21:25.409,00:21:29.914,"SO, YOU KNOW, YOUR CO-WORKERS SEEM TO WANT A SHOW."
00:21:29.914,00:21:32.458,SO JUST SAY THE WORD AND WE CAN START MAKING OUT.
00:21:32.458,00:21:34.334,IGNORE THEM.
00:21:34.334,00:21:36.336,I-I JUST -- I DON'T TALK TO GUYS AT BARS THAT OFTEN.
00:21:36.336,00:21:38.589,"SO, LET ME GUESS."
00:21:38.589,00:21:42.093,YOU GUYS ALL WORK IN THE ADVERTISING AGENCY UPSTAIRS?
00:21:42.093,00:21:43.803,IS IT THAT OBVIOUS?
00:21:43.803,00:21:50.350,"I WORK IN THE BANK ACROSS THE STREET, AND THE ONLY HOT GUYS THAT EVER COME IN HERE ARE FROM YOUR AGENCY."
00:21:50.350,00:21:53.437,HOT?
00:21:53.437,00:21:56.023,"I DON'T WORK IN THE COOL PART OF THE COMPANY, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING."
00:21:56.023,00:21:58.692,I'M IN I.T.
00:21:58.692,00:22:01.779,"NO, I-I THINK I.T.'s VERY COOL."
00:22:03.405,00:22:06.408,CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
00:22:06.408,00:22:10.496,DID YOU KNOW THAT SECRETARY THAT TRIED TO KILL HER BOSS WITH AN ASPIRIN?
00:22:10.496,00:22:13.874,THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT WARNED US NOT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
00:22:13.874,00:22:16.252,OH. RIGHT.
00:22:16.252,00:22:17.544,SORRY I ASKED.
00:22:22.591,00:22:27.387,"UH, OKAY, BUT NO ONE CAN KNOW I TOLD YOU THIS."
00:22:30.683,00:22:32.101,HOW'D YOU GET THIS?
00:22:34.478,00:22:37.982,I THOUGHT ALL YOU WANTED FROM ME WERE THOSE E-MAILS.
00:22:40.318,00:22:42.820,I DID.
00:22:42.820,00:22:44.738,TURN OVER.
00:22:50.494,00:22:54.290,"IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL, IS THE POINT."
00:22:54.290,00:22:56.667,THEN WE JUST HAVE TO GET CREATIVE.
00:22:56.667,00:22:59.377,BONNIE!
00:22:59.377,00:23:08.346,"MR. BRYANT, YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER, MR. KAUFMAN, HAD A MEETING IN HIS OFFICE ON THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT, CORRECT?"
00:23:08.346,00:23:11.431,YES. TO DISCUSS MOVING GINA TO ACCOUNTING.
00:23:11.431,00:23:13.559,SO TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE SEXUAL-HARASSMENT LAWSUIT?
00:23:13.559,00:23:15.728,THAT'S CORRECT.
00:23:15.728,00:23:17.688,WILL YOU PLEASE READ THIS E-MAIL THAT YOU WROTE TO MR. KAUFMAN?
00:23:17.688,00:23:22.693,"DEAR ARTHUR, CONSIDER THIS MY OFFICIAL REQUEST THAT YOU STEP DOWN AS C.E.O."
00:23:22.693,00:23:28.490,"I'VE WARNED YOU ABOUT HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH EMPLOYEES OF THIS COMPANY -- YOUR HONOR, THIS E-MAIL WAS NOT PART OF THE DISCOVERY FILE."
00:23:28.490,00:23:30.826,IS THIS TRUE?
00:23:30.826,00:23:33.787,ALTHOUGH MY ASSOCIATE IS MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE PAPERWORK ON THIS CASE.
00:23:33.787,00:23:35.248,BONNIE?
00:23:35.248,00:23:36.999,"OH, MY GOD."
00:23:36.999,00:23:40.544,"I FOUND THE E-MAIL IN THE FILES GIVEN TO US BY OUR CLIENT'S PREVIOUS ATTORNEY, YOUR HONOR."
00:23:40.544,00:23:42.420,I JUST ASSUMED IT WAS PART OF THE DISCOVERY FILE.
00:23:42.420,00:23:45.632,"IT WASN'T, WHICH MEANS IT WAS OBVIOUSLY OBTAINED ILLEGALLY."
00:23:45.632,00:23:47.051,ENOUGH.
00:23:47.051,00:23:50.179,"DID YOU WRITE THIS E-MAIL, MR. BRYANT?"
00:23:50.179,00:23:52.306,THEN I HAVE TO SIDE WITH THE DEFENSE HERE.
00:23:52.306,00:23:54.225,THE E-MAIL'S ADMISSIBLE.
00:23:54.225,00:23:55.851,"I'VE MADE MY DECISION, MR. WILLIAMS."
00:23:55.851,00:24:04.235,"MR. BRYANT, AS STATED IN THE E-MAIL, YOU WERE ANGRY AT MR. KAUFMAN FOR TAKING PART IN A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH AN EMPLOYEE."
00:24:04.235,00:24:05.736,"I WAS FRUSTRATED, YES."
00:24:05.736,00:24:12.201,SO FRUSTRATED THAT PERHAPS YOU SWAPPED HIS BLOOD PRESSURE PILL FOR AN ASPIRIN IN ORDER TO GAIN SOLE OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANY?
00:24:12.201,00:24:14.078,OBJECTION!
00:24:14.078,00:24:16.663,NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.
00:24:16.663,00:24:21.168,"Annalise: WE DID WELL TODAY, NO DOUBT DUE TO MR. WALSH'S HARD WORK LAST NIGHT."
00:24:21.168,00:24:24.255,I'LL BE AT THE DEAN'S COCKTAIL PARTY IF YOU FIND ANYTHING BEFORE TOMORROW.
00:24:24.255,00:24:25.672,HOW'D YOU GET THAT E-MAIL?
00:24:25.672,00:24:28.466,"YEAH, BRO, FOR REALS."
00:24:28.466,00:24:31.804,I DON'T KISS AND TELL.
00:24:31.804,00:24:33.931,WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?
00:24:35.433,00:24:37.977,WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
00:24:37.977,00:24:40.020,DON'T -- DON'T GO!
00:24:40.020,00:24:41.855,DON'T GO. DON'T GO.
00:24:41.855,00:24:44.733,"Shh, shh, shh."
00:25:27.901,00:25:30.070,Griffin: IT'S ABOUT THE BOTH OF US. DON'T YOU GET THAT?
00:25:30.070,00:25:32.614,"Rebecca: GRIFFIN, STOP!"
00:25:32.614,00:25:35.617,STOP YELLING!
00:25:40.956,00:25:43.376,DO YOU NEED HELP?
00:25:43.376,00:25:44.542,IT'S FINE.
00:25:44.542,00:25:46.670,IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
00:25:46.670,00:25:48.255,GET OUT OF MY APARTMENT!
00:26:04.146,00:26:05.981,"FIRST YEAR IS THE WORST, NO DOUBT."
00:26:05.981,00:26:10.277,"JUST PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN, DO THE WORK, AND TRY NOT TO TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY."
00:26:10.277,00:26:13.197,"OKAY, NO OFFENSE, MAN, BUT, OBVIOUSLY, YOU NEVER WENT TO LAW SCHOOL."
00:26:13.197,00:26:15.949,THIS PLACE IS A DOGFIGHT 24/7.
00:26:15.949,00:26:17.784,AND ONLY THE BIG DOG GET THE BONE.
00:26:19.370,00:26:21.372,FINE.
00:26:21.372,00:26:22.956,I'M A PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR.
00:26:22.956,00:26:27.378,"BUT BEFORE YOU LOSE ALL RESPECT FOR ME, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I WORK WITH THE FIRM SOMETIMES."
00:26:27.378,00:26:29.213,AND YOU? YOU ARE?
00:26:29.213,00:26:31.382,WES.
00:26:31.382,00:26:33.633,AH. SAM.
00:26:33.633,00:26:35.344,HAS SHE GONE FULL TERRORIST ON YOU YET OR NO?
00:26:37.388,00:26:38.972,I'M SORRY.
00:26:38.972,00:26:40.307,PROFESSOR KEATING.
00:26:41.599,00:26:43.727,THERE SHE IS.
00:26:43.727,00:26:44.895,LET ME GUESS -- YOUR EARS WERE BURNING?
00:26:44.895,00:26:46.355,SHOULD THEY BE?
00:26:46.355,00:26:48.566,I DIDN'T SPILL ANY SECRETS.
00:26:48.566,00:26:50.443,"WELL, NOT YET, AT LEAST."
00:26:52.319,00:26:53.487,TO FIRST YEAR.
00:27:10.712,00:27:12.923,THEY'RE TOTALLY WONDERING WHERE WE WENT RIGHT NOW.
00:27:12.923,00:27:14.716,Man: NO WAY.

00:27:22.391,00:27:24.768,FLASHLIGHT.
00:27:24.768,00:27:26.395,"HEY, HEY. JEN CANNOT FIND OUT ABOUT THIS, OKAY?"
00:27:26.395,00:27:28.522,DEAL.
00:27:32.650,00:27:34.236,WHAT WAS THAT?
00:27:41.160,00:27:43.454,HEY! WHO'S THERE?
00:27:44.746,00:27:46.790,CAN WE GO?
00:27:54.507,00:27:56.425,WHY IS FRANK CALLING YOU?
00:27:56.425,00:27:57.759,WHAT?
00:27:57.759,00:27:59.052,"I SAW YOUR PHONE, LAUREL."
00:27:59.052,00:28:01.013,WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
00:28:04.016,00:28:10.897,"I ONLY SAW THEM TOGETHER FOR A SECOND, I KNOW, BUT -- WELL, IT MAKES SENSE."

00:36:09.459,00:36:14.589,BUT THE LOGS SAY HE DIDN'T LOG IT INTO CUSTODY UNTIL 2:09 A.M.
00:36:14.589,00:36:17.175,DON'T YOU FIND THAT TIME GAP ODD?
00:36:17.175,00:36:20.804,SOMETIMES IT TAKES US A WHILE TO LOG EVIDENCE INTO THE COMPUTER.

00:01:11.405,00:01:12.823,BECAUSE YOU HAD A MELTDOWN!
00:01:12.823,00:01:13.991,YOU COULD BARELY FORM A SENTENCE.
00:01:13.991,00:01:17.202,"SO SHUT UP, SIT DOWN, AND STOP ACTING LIKE A LITTLE BITCH BABY."
00:01:17.202,00:01:18.579,DO NOT TELL ME HOW TO FEEL RIGHT NOW!
00:01:18.579,00:01:19.830,Wes: HEY!
00:01:19.830,00:01:22.123,SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.
00:01:22.123,00:01:23.500,I WENT BACK FOR THIS.
00:01:36.597,00:01:38.057,NOTHING NEW?
00:01:38.057,00:01:40.141,DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT.
00:01:40.141,00:01:42.061,MAKES SENSE.
00:01:42.061,00:01:46.440,ALL THE TIME HER BODY WAS IN THAT WATER TANK PROBABLY DESTROYED ANY EVIDENCE.
00:01:46.440,00:01:49.150,I'M GONNA BE HOME LATE.
00:01:49.150,00:01:52.738,DEAN JOVICH WANTS ME AT THE MEETING ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE THE GRIEF COUNSELING.
00:01:52.738,00:01:56.199,REALLY?
00:02:00.120,00:02:03.164,BECAUSE HE WANTS SOMEONE THERE FROM THE PSYCH DEPARTMENT.
00:02:03.164,00:02:05.542,MM.
00:02:05.542,00:02:07.335,BUT WHO KNOWS?
00:02:07.335,00:02:09.588,"MAYBE THAT'S PART OF IT, TOO."
00:02:11.090,00:02:13.133,I'VE GOT CLASS.
00:02:13.133,00:02:20.099,Annalise: THE QUESTION I'M ASKED MOST OFTEN AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY IS WHETHER I CAN TELL IF MY CLIENTS ARE INNOCENT OR GUILTY.
00:02:20.099,00:02:22.392,AND MY ANSWER IS ALWAYS THE SAME.
00:02:22.392,00:02:24.561,I DON'T CARE.
00:02:24.561,00:02:33.194,"AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M HEARTLESS, ALTHOUGH THAT'S UP FOR DEBATE, BUT BECAUSE MY CLIENTS, LIKE ALL OF US HERE IN THIS ROOM, LIE."
00:02:33.194,00:02:35.656,AND THAT MAKES THEM UNKNOWABLE.
00:02:35.656,00:02:38.241,"TAKE MR. MILLSTONE, HERE."
00:02:38.241,00:02:44.414,"ARE YOU REALLY WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE, OR ARE THERE OTHER SORDID DETAILS THAT WE'RE MISSING?"
00:02:44.414,00:02:48.418,"CRIMINAL RECORD, DIVORCE, AN ACTUAL SKELETON IN YOUR CLOSET?"
00:02:48.418,00:02:51.755,"I CAN ASSURE YOU I'VE, UH, I'VE NEVER HURT A FLY."
00:02:53.172,00:02:54.508,SO YOU SAY.
00:02:56.301,00:02:58.428,LOOK AROUND YOU.
00:02:58.428,00:03:10.524,"AT THE QUIET GIRL YOU SHARE NOTES WITH, THE CUTE GUY YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON, THE GUNNER WHO TALKS TOO MUCH IN CLASS, AND ASK YOURSELVES, DO YOU KNOW WHO ANYONE REALLY IS?"
00:03:10.524,00:03:18.949,"YOUR INSTINCTS BETTER BE GOOD, OR YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF CHOOSING THE WRONG PEOPLE TO MAKE A STUDY GROUP WITH, TO SLEEP WITH, OR EVEN MARRY."
00:03:18.949,00:03:32.379,"JUST ASK MARJORIE ST. VINCENT, HEIR TO HER FAMILY'S BILLION-DOLLAR DEPARTMENT-STORE FORTUNE UNTIL SHE WAS STABBED 16 TIMES IN THE MASTER BEDROOM OF HER GLADWYNE MANSION."
00:03:32.379,00:03:35.924,"THE ALLEGED KILLER -- HER HUSBAND, OF COURSE."
00:03:35.924,00:03:38.593,MAX ST. VINCENT.
00:03:38.593,00:03:40.762,Max: I MET MARJORIE IN PARIS.
00:03:40.762,00:03:44.391,I WAS SHOPPING FOR MY DAUGHTER ELOISE'S FOURTH BIRTHDAY.
00:03:44.391,00:03:45.976,MY WIFE HAD JUST PASSED.
00:03:45.976,00:03:58.238,"I NEEDED SOMETHING WHEN MARJORIE SAW ME STRUGGLING TO SPEAK TO THE OWNER IN FRENCH, WELL, FROM THE MINUTE SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO TRANSLATE, I KNEW THIS WAS THE WOMAN FOR ME."
00:03:58.238,00:04:03.618,"AND 20 YEARS LATER, SHE'S STILL THE ONLY WOMAN WHO KNEW HOW TO MAKE ME HAPPY."
00:04:04.953,00:04:10.500,"WELL, AS MUCH AS ANYBODY CAN BE HAPPY IN AN INSTITUTION AS BARBARIC AS A MARRIAGE."
00:04:10.500,00:04:11.960,"DON'T YOU AGREE, MS. KEATING?"
00:04:11.960,00:04:14.213,LET'S KEEP IT MOVING.
00:04:23.180,00:04:27.768,I ASKED MAX TO PRESERVE THE CRIME SCENE UNTIL AFTER THE TRIAL WAS OVER.
00:04:27.768,00:04:31.479,YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT FORENSIC CLUES YOU'LL FIND TO HELP OUR CASE LATER.
00:04:31.479,00:04:34.066,"AND THE ROOM NEEDED SOME COLOR, ANYWAY."
00:04:35.817,00:04:37.444,YOU GONNA THROW UP?
00:04:37.444,00:04:41.364,NO. I'M GOOD.
00:04:41.364,00:04:46.661,"Annalise: LOOK AROUND, TAKE PHOTOS, BE THE FRESH EYES WE NEED TO HELP THIS CASE."
00:04:56.588,00:04:58.632,IS IT TIME?
00:04:58.632,00:04:59.925,I THINK IT IS.
00:04:59.925,00:05:01.676,I NEED A VOLUNTEER.
00:05:02.719,00:05:04.263,LADIES?
00:05:05.555,00:05:08.892,I'LL DO IT.
00:05:10.060,00:05:12.479,VERY WELL.
00:05:12.479,00:05:16.024,YOU'RE ABOUT AS PRETTY AS MY WIFE WAS.
00:05:16.024,00:05:18.277,YEAH.
00:05:21.196,00:05:22.489,NOW...
00:05:24.324,00:05:25.575,ON THE BED.
00:05:27.244,00:05:38.546,"THE FORENSIC REPORT CLAIMS THAT MARJORIE WAS IN BED READING WHEN I JOINED HER WITH, UH...AH!"
00:05:38.546,00:05:41.008,"YOUR PEN, DEAR. PEN."
00:05:43.051,00:05:47.889,"THE KNIFE, WHICH I HID, LIKE THIS."
00:05:47.889,00:05:50.809,THEN I PRETENDED...
00:05:52.811,00:05:55.814,TO INITIATE SEXUAL RELATIONS.
00:05:55.814,00:06:00.068,AND JUST AS WE WERE ABOUT TO KISS...
00:06:01.653,00:06:03.947,I STRUCK.
00:06:03.947,00:06:12.664,"BUT MISSED, HITTING THE CAROTID ARTERY, WHICH WAS NOW SQUIRTING LIKE A LOOSE FIRE HOSE, HENCE THE WALLS, SO THEN I STRUCK AGAIN, NUMBER TWO."
00:06:12.664,00:06:14.124,HIT HERE.
00:06:14.124,00:06:16.751,"FOLLOWED BY NUMBER THREE, HERE."
00:06:16.751,00:06:20.964,"NUMBER FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN."
00:06:26.136,00:06:27.929,SIXTEEN.
00:06:29.139,00:06:32.017,SHEESH.
00:06:32.017,00:06:34.769,OR SO THAT'S THE PROSECUTION'S THEORY.
00:06:34.769,00:06:37.105,THEORY?
00:06:37.105,00:06:39.107,"GOOD LUCK PROVING THAT, HUH?"
00:06:39.107,00:06:41.902,OH.
00:06:47.115,00:06:51.578,"THE MURDER BOOK, GIVEN TO US BY THE PROSECUTION WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE THEY'VE GATHERED IN MAX'S CASE."
00:06:51.578,00:06:53.412,GO THROUGH IT.
00:06:53.412,00:06:56.166,FIND THE HOLES TO HELP GET OUR GUY A NOT GUILTY.
00:06:56.166,00:06:59.336,"MAX SAID THERE WERE THREE OFFICERS AT THE SCENE, BUT ONLY TWO WERE ON THE REPORT."
00:06:59.336,00:07:00.795,WE NEED THE ORIGINALS.
00:07:00.795,00:07:02.923,I WAS THINKING WE SEND THE PUPPY.
00:07:02.923,00:07:04.716,SMART.
00:07:04.716,00:07:07.468,"MR. GIBBONS, MY OFFICE NOW."
00:07:11.932,00:07:14.184,WHAT DO WE THINK IS GOING ON THERE?
00:07:14.184,00:07:15.810,"WE ALL EARNED OUR SPOT HERE, RIGHT?"
00:07:15.810,00:07:17.478,BUT WAIT LIST?
00:07:17.478,00:07:20.357,DON'T CALL HIM THAT.
00:07:17.478,00:07:23.068,"MAYBE HE'S HER SECRET BABY, LIKE SHE GAVE HIM UP FOR ADOPTION AND HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW."
00:07:23.068,00:07:24.569,BECAUSE ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE RELATED.
00:07:24.569,00:07:26.196,WHAT? NO.
00:07:24.569,00:07:28.907,"I-I WASN'T -- MY POINT IS, SOMETHING IS GOING ON."
00:07:28.907,00:07:31.034,"OTHERWISE, WHY WOULD HE BE HERE?"
00:07:31.034,00:07:33.287,WHY ARE ANY OF YOU HERE?
00:07:33.287,00:07:35.747,THAT'S THE QUESTION I'M STILL ASKING MYSELF.
00:07:40.835,00:07:45.299,Annalise: FRANK SAYS THAT YOU'RE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THE JOB.
00:07:45.299,00:07:48.843,"AND WHAT FRANK THINKS, I USUALLY AGREE WITH."
00:07:52.139,00:07:54.266,SO...
00:07:54.266,00:07:56.310,IS HE RIGHT?
00:07:56.310,00:07:58.603,ARE YOU REGRETTING YOUR DECISION TO JOIN US?
00:07:58.603,00:08:01.231,NO.
00:08:01.231,00:08:02.732,I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.
00:08:05.652,00:08:07.237,GOOD.
00:08:07.237,00:08:09.906,"LET'S GIVE YOU MORE RESPONSIBILITY, THEN."
00:08:09.906,00:08:15.829,GO TO THIS POLICE DEPARTMENT AND GET THE SUPPLEMENTAL ARREST REPORT FOR MR. ST. VINCENT.
00:08:15.829,00:08:19.040,DON'T GIVE YOUR NAME OR MINE.
00:08:19.040,00:08:21.251,YOU THINK YOU COULD HANDLE THAT?
00:08:21.251,00:08:23.003,YES.
00:08:25.546,00:08:28.467,THANK YOU.
00:08:35.849,00:08:37.225,ARE YOU FLIPPING KIDDING ME?
00:08:37.225,00:08:38.852,WHAT?
00:08:38.852,00:08:42.314,"LUCINDA TEACHES YOU THIS WHEN YOU START WORKING FOR HER, RIGHT?"
00:08:42.314,00:08:44.899,THAT THE REST OF US ONLY EXIST TO SERVE THE D.A.'s OFFICE?
00:08:44.899,00:08:46.693,D.A.'s OFFICE?
00:08:46.693,00:08:48.569,IT'S LIKE THAT WOMAN LOOKS FOR WAYS TO WASTE MY TIME.
00:08:48.569,00:08:52.366,"YOU CAN TELL THAT TO LUCINDA, OKAY?"
00:08:52.366,00:08:54.075,SURE.
00:09:10.342,00:09:17.057,"THE DUMB STRIPPERS UPSTAIRS MUST HAVE FLUSHED THEIR DRUGS DOWN THE TOILET, BECAUSE NOW THERE'S DISGUSTINGNESS COMING OUT OF MY SHOWER DRAIN."
00:09:17.057,00:09:18.725,UH -- I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.
00:09:18.725,00:09:21.769,I CAN'T SLEEP TILL I'VE WASHED ALL THE BEER AND FRAT-BOY STENCH OFF OF ME.
00:09:21.769,00:09:23.563,RIGHT.
00:09:23.563,00:09:25.482,WOW.
00:09:25.482,00:09:26.900,I THINK I LIKED RUDY'S SETUP BETTER.
00:09:26.900,00:09:29.194,"UH, RUDY?"
00:09:29.194,00:09:32.489,"YEAH, HE'S THE FREAK WHO LIVED HERE BEFORE YOU."
00:09:32.489,00:09:35.658,YOU ACTUALLY KIND OF REMIND ME OF HIM.
00:09:35.658,00:09:39.579,PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU BOTH HAVE THAT CRAZED LOOK ON YOUR FACE ALL THE TIME.
00:09:40.955,00:09:44.000,"IT'S PROBABLY A LAW-SCHOOL THING, RIGHT?"
00:09:44.000,00:09:46.253,I GUESS.
00:09:49.381,00:09:51.007,UH...
00:09:51.007,00:09:54.135,I SHOULD GET BACK TO THIS WORK.
00:10:06.022,00:10:08.691,SHUT UP!
00:10:08.691,00:10:11.861,IT'S TWO AGAINST TWO.
00:10:11.861,00:10:14.155,WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.
00:10:14.155,00:10:16.616,THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING YOU'VE EVER SAID.
00:10:16.616,00:10:19.077,I'M NOT LETTING A FREAKING COIN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT I GO TO JAIL TONIGHT!
00:10:19.077,00:10:20.912,WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO FIGHT!
00:10:20.912,00:10:22.663,WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION AND COMMIT TO IT.
00:10:22.663,00:10:24.749,"SO IF SOMEONE HAS A BETTER IDEA, SAY IT NOW!"
00:10:29.379,00:10:31.131,"HEADS, WE GET THE BODY."
00:10:31.131,00:10:34.217,"TAILS, WE LEAVE IT WHERE IT IS. OKAY?"
00:10:45.312,00:10:47.772,HEADS.
00:10:47.772,00:10:49.941,WE GO BACK FOR THE BODY.

00:14:26.491,00:14:30.495,"THAT IS A STRIP CLUB, AND IT IS DOWN ON -- CASTER AVE., YEAH."
00:14:30.495,00:14:32.038,THIS IS GOOD.
00:14:32.038,00:14:35.792,I DOUBT DAD WILL WANT MOM TO FIND OUT ABOUT WHERE HE'S SPENDING THE KIDS' TUITION.
00:14:38.461,00:14:40.588,IT WAS AROUND 8:30 WHEN I TOOK OUT THE TRASH THAT NIGHT.
00:14:40.588,00:14:42.549,RIGHT AFTER OUR NIGHTLY FAMILY DINNER.
00:14:42.549,00:14:44.718,Annalise: AND WHAT DID YOU SEE WHILE YOU WERE OUTSIDE?
00:14:44.718,00:14:46.511,A MAN WALKING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.
00:14:46.511,00:14:48.095,AND DID YOU RECOGNIZE THE MAN?
00:14:48.095,00:14:56.479,"WELL, IT WAS VERY DARK THAT NIGHT, BUT I THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS MY NEIGHBOR, MR. ST. VINCENT."
00:14:56.479,00:15:00.817,"THE PROSECUTION HAS RESTED, SO THE FIRST WITNESS TO TAKE THE STAND WILL BE MAX'S DAUGHTER."
00:15:00.817,00:15:03.194,I NEED SOMEONE TO WRITE UP THE PREP QUESTIONS.
00:15:03.194,00:15:04.320,I'LL DO IT.
00:15:04.320,00:15:06.447,FRANK'S GIRL. GOOD.
00:15:06.447,00:15:08.408,HAVE THEM ON MY DESK BY MIDNIGHT.
00:15:20.336,00:15:22.505,I'LL MEET YOU BACK AT THE HOUSE.
00:15:28.010,00:15:29.554,LET ME GUESS.
00:15:29.554,00:15:33.182,YOU WERE SENT TO TELL ME TO STOP EMBARRASSING COPS ON THE STAND.
00:15:33.182,00:15:34.642,YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.
00:15:34.642,00:15:36.436,THERE'S GONNA BE PUSHBACK.
00:15:36.436,00:15:37.520,IS THAT A THREAT?
00:15:37.520,00:15:38.855,NOT FROM ME.
00:15:40.481,00:15:41.900,YOU HAVEN'T RETURNED MY CALLS.
00:15:41.900,00:15:43.651,I'M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT US.
00:15:43.651,00:15:45.528,SO THAT'S IT?
00:15:45.528,00:15:47.781,YOU KNOW I NEVER SET OUT TO HURT YOU ON PURPOSE.
00:15:47.781,00:15:51.242,"YOU BLACKMAILED ME ON THE STAND, MADE ME SELL OUT MY DEPARTMENT."
00:15:51.242,00:15:52.326,I'LL BE LUCKY IF THE CHIEF GIVES ME ANOTHER CASE ALL YEAR.
00:15:52.326,00:15:54.203,I'LL TALK TO HIM.
00:15:54.203,00:15:55.789,YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON I WANT TALKING FOR ME RIGHT NOW.
00:15:55.789,00:15:57.498,"NOW, I'M TRYING TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT."
00:15:57.498,00:15:58.792,DON'T YOU WANT ME TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT?
00:15:58.792,00:16:00.209,I'M DONE WITH YOUR CRAZY.
00:16:00.209,00:16:01.795,NATE.
00:16:01.795,00:16:05.590,"YOU WON YOUR CASE, GOT LAID."
00:16:05.590,00:16:08.885,SO HOW ELSE CAN I BE OF SERVICE TO YOU?
00:16:08.885,00:16:16.893,"YOU CALL ME AGAIN, AND I SWEAR TO GOD I'LL TELL YOUR HUSBAND EVERY DIRTY, NASTY THING I DID TO YOU UNDER HIS OWN ROOF."
00:17:00.603,00:17:02.229,Man: IS THAT ALL FOR YOU?
00:17:04.941,00:17:07.193,"ROOM 203, PLEASE."
00:17:07.193,00:17:10.864,IT'S ME. DON'T WORRY.
00:17:10.864,00:17:14.742,"I KNOW, BUT I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU WE'RE TAKING CARE OF IT."
00:17:14.742,00:17:18.663,"THEY DIDN'T WANT TO AT FIRST, BUT I GOT THEM TO COME AROUND."
00:17:18.663,00:17:20.665,WE'RE GONNA PROTECT YOU.
00:17:24.460,00:17:25.586,SAM?
00:17:26.838,00:17:28.673,Sam: I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE.
00:17:56.868,00:17:59.662,HAVE YOU EATEN YET?
00:17:59.662,00:18:01.288,HOW ABOUT THAT INDIAN PLACE?
00:18:01.288,00:18:05.585,"THEY TAKE FOREVER TO DELIVER, BUT I'LL PICK IT UP IF YOU WANT TO CALL."
00:18:12.132,00:18:13.593,ANNIE?
00:18:15.636,00:18:18.056,EVERYTHING OKAY?
00:18:18.056,00:18:20.140,YEAH.
00:18:20.140,00:18:23.227,OKAY.
00:18:23.227,00:18:24.604,GREAT.
00:18:33.362,00:18:35.322,"WELL, LOOK AT US."
00:18:35.322,00:18:37.867,YOU ON YOUR WAY HOME FROM WORK AND ME ON MY WAY THERE.
00:18:37.867,00:18:40.119,SHIPS IN THE NIGHT.
00:18:42.038,00:18:49.169,"UH, HEY, UH, SO I SAW YOUR FRIEND ON THE NEWS -- THE FOOTBALL PLAYER, ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND, LILA STANGARD."
00:18:49.169,00:18:50.588,AND?
00:18:50.588,00:18:53.049,I JUST WANTED TO SAY SORRY...
00:18:53.049,00:18:54.092,"IF SHE WAS YOUR FRIEND, TOO."
00:18:54.092,00:18:55.342,SHE WASN'T.
00:18:56.510,00:18:58.137,YOU A COP OR SOMETHING?
00:18:59.847,00:19:01.599,THE NEWS SAID THE COPS WERE QUESTIONING HIM.
00:19:01.599,00:19:05.394,I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU KNEW DON'T EVER TALK TO THEM WITHOUT A LAWYER.
00:19:05.394,00:19:06.896,YEAH. I KNOW.
00:19:06.896,00:19:09.273,"I'M NOT AN IDIOT, AND YOU'RE NOT A LAWYER."
00:19:09.273,00:19:11.985,YOU'RE MAKING ME LATE.
00:19:22.286,00:19:27.207,THESE ARE THE PREP QUESTIONS FOR THE DAUGHTER.
00:19:27.207,00:19:29.919,GREAT.
00:19:32.797,00:19:35.133,WHAT?
00:19:51.024,00:19:52.191,A LOT.
00:19:55.987,00:19:59.198,"IT'S, UH, FRANK, RIGHT?"
00:19:59.198,00:20:02.409,"I MEAN, HE PICKED ME, NOT PROFESSOR KEATING."
00:20:07.373,00:20:11.002,"I LOOK NICE, I KNOW, BUT THAT'S JUST MY FACE."
00:20:11.002,00:20:15.214,AND YOU COMING TO ME WITH YOUR QUESTIONS AND PERSONAL DRAMA IS NOT GOING TO MAKE ME NICER.
00:20:15.214,00:20:26.433,"SO RATHER THAN ME TELL YOU THE ANSWER TO WHAT YOU JUST ASKED, LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE TIME YOU ARE WASTING WORRYING ABOUT FRANK IS TIME YOU SHOULD BE USING GETTING ANNALISE TO ACTUALLY LEARN YOUR NAME."
00:20:28.352,00:20:30.646,I'M DONE TALKING TO YOU.
00:20:35.568,00:20:38.612,Annalise: CAN YOU TRUST YOUR CHARACTER WITNESS ON THE STAND?
00:20:41.741,00:20:45.161,THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DILEMMAS AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY.
00:20:45.161,00:20:49.456,"YOUR CHARACTER WITNESS IS TOO POSITIVE, THE JURY FEELS MANIPULATED."
00:20:49.456,00:20:52.251,"TOO HONEST, AND YOU SHOT YOUR CASE IN THE FOOT."
00:20:52.251,00:20:55.295,WHICH IS WHY IT ALL COMES DOWN TO PRETRIAL PREP.
00:20:55.295,00:20:57.131,Max: TEAM.
00:20:57.131,00:20:58.799,"I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MY DAUGHTER, ELOISE."
00:20:58.799,00:21:00.718,SHE'S FRESH OFF THE PLANE FROM STANFORD.
00:21:00.718,00:21:03.137,SHE DROPPED EVERYTHING THE MINUTE WE SAID WE NEEDED HER.
00:21:03.137,00:21:05.264,I'M GETTING A MASTER'S IN POETRY.
00:21:05.264,00:21:06.807,THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DROP.
00:21:06.807,00:21:08.392,"MM, ELLIE."
00:21:08.392,00:21:10.853,HE'S THE ONE I MENTIONED IN THE CAR.
00:21:10.853,00:21:14.107,THINK OF THE BEAUTIFUL BABIES YOU TWO WOULD MAKE.
00:21:16.192,00:21:19.987,THE CHALLENGE IS IN ESTABLISHING YOUR WITNESS'S CREDIBILITY.
00:21:19.987,00:21:22.907,"YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM BEING REAL, EVEN CRITICAL OF YOUR CLIENT."
00:21:22.907,00:21:24.491,Bonnie: HE'S YOUR FATHER.
00:21:24.491,00:21:28.204,ARE WE REALLY SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULDN'T LIE FOR HIM ON THE STAND?
00:21:28.204,00:21:31.331,"I LOVE MY FATHER, OBVIOUSLY, BUT I ALSO LOVE MARJORIE."
00:21:31.331,00:21:35.711,"IF MY FATHER HURT HER, I'D INSIST YOU GIVE HIM THE DEATH PENALTY."
00:21:35.711,00:21:38.131,SEE?
00:21:38.131,00:21:41.300,BE AS PUNISHING AS POSSIBLE.
00:21:41.300,00:21:43.261,NO TOPIC IS OFF LIMITS.
00:21:43.261,00:21:45.638,WHAT ABOUT WHEN HE SENT YOU TO THE MENTAL INSTITUTION?
00:21:45.638,00:21:47.974,"HE TOLD YOU YOU WERE CRAZY, RIGHT?"
00:21:47.974,00:21:51.518,"I WAS 15 AND ANOREXIC, JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER GIRL AT MY PRIVATE SCHOOL."
00:21:51.518,00:21:53.353,AND I GOT BETTER.
00:21:53.353,00:21:55.481,BECAUSE YOU WERE ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM HIS BAD PARENTING?
00:21:55.481,00:21:57.441,HE WASN'T A BAD PARENT.
00:21:57.441,00:22:01.737,"HE'S ODD, YES, ECCENTRIC, BUT IT'S JUST A DEFENSE MECHANISM."
00:22:01.737,00:22:05.241,HIS PARENTS DIED WHEN HE WAS A CHILD.
00:22:05.241,00:22:12.915,"HIS FIRST WIFE, MY BIRTH MOTHER, DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS 3."
00:22:12.915,00:22:15.501,THAT CHANGES YOU.
00:22:15.501,00:22:18.712,MAKES YOU SCARED OF LOSING PEOPLE.
00:22:18.712,00:22:21.882,THAT'S WHY HE CLUNG TO MARJORIE AND ME.
00:22:21.882,00:22:24.384,WE WERE HIS ENTIRE WORLD.
00:22:24.384,00:22:27.930,WHICH IS HOW I KNOW THERE'S NO WAY HE COULD HAVE HURT HER.
00:22:27.930,00:22:32.768,"I GET THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE COMING FROM ME, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH."
00:22:34.394,00:22:36.189,YOUR WITNESS.
00:22:39.108,00:22:43.070,YOUR FATHER MET MARJORIE AFTER YOUR FIRST MOTHER DIED IN SWITZERLAND.
00:22:43.070,00:22:44.780,IS THAT CORRECT?
00:22:44.780,00:22:46.782,WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT WAS A LIE?
00:22:46.782,00:22:49.827,THAT YOUR FATHER AND MARJORIE WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
00:22:49.827,00:22:51.954,"NO, MY MOTHER DIED BEFORE THEY MET."
00:22:51.954,00:22:53.622,IN A CAR ACCIDENT.
00:22:53.622,00:22:55.499,OR AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT YOUR FATHER TOLD YOU.
00:22:55.499,00:22:58.418,"YOUR HONOR, IF THE PROSECUTOR WANTS TO TESTIFY, SWEAR HER IN."
00:22:58.418,00:23:05.134,"THE STATE WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE CERTIFIED SWISS DEATH REPORT FOR MR. ST. VINCENT'S FIRST WIFE, ELIZABETH SIMS."
00:23:05.134,00:23:09.138,IT'S BEEN TRANSLATED SO MS. ST. VINCENT CAN READ IT FOR THE JURY.
00:23:11.224,00:23:21.525,ELIZABETH SIMS DIED AT AGE 28 FROM A DEEPLY INCISED WOUND OF THE UPPER NECK IN THE MANNER OF HOMICIDE.
00:23:21.525,00:23:24.237,AND THE MURDER WEAPON?
00:23:24.237,00:23:26.155,A HUNTING KNIFE.
00:23:41.045,00:23:44.382,"STUART SIMS WAS PUT ON TRIAL IN GLATTBRUGG, SWITZERLAND, FOR THE MURDER OF HIS WIFE, ELIZABETH."
00:23:44.382,00:23:49.136,"THE PROSECUTION ARGUED HIS MOTIVE WAS TO RUN AWAY WITH HIS MISTRESS, MARJORIE TRASK, BUT STUART WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY."
00:23:49.136,00:23:57.103,"THE FOLLOWING YEAR, HE CREATED A NEW IDENTITY FOR HIM AND HIS DAUGHTER AS MAX AND ELOISE ST. VINCENT, THEN SETTLED IN PHILADELPHIA WITH MARJORIE FOR A FRESH FAKE START."
00:23:57.103,00:23:58.478,CHARMING.
00:23:58.478,00:24:00.064,I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.
00:24:00.064,00:24:01.481,BY LYING TO ME ABOUT MY ENTIRE LIFE?
00:24:01.481,00:24:03.943,HOW DO YOU TELL A YOUNG GIRL HER MOTHER'S BEEN BUTCHERED TO DEATH?
00:24:03.943,00:24:06.279,WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT DO?
00:24:06.279,00:24:07.696,"AND NOW MARJORIE, TOO?"
00:24:07.696,00:24:09.115,DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
00:24:09.115,00:24:10.908,YOU KILLED THE BOTH OF THEM.
00:24:10.908,00:24:12.159,YOU'RE A MURDERER AND A LIAR.
00:24:12.159,00:24:14.536,DO NOT COME NEAR ME.
00:24:14.536,00:24:17.290,I HOPE THE JURY DECIDES TO KILL YOU.
00:24:19.541,00:24:21.752,"I KIND OF AGREE WITH HER, YO."
00:24:21.752,00:24:23.963,"HELLO, STUART."
00:24:26.506,00:24:29.843,"SO, WOULD YOU HAVE TAKEN MY CASE HAD I TOLD YOU?"
00:24:29.843,00:24:32.721,YOU UNDERESTIMATE HOW MUCH I LIKE A CHALLENGE.
00:24:32.721,00:24:35.349,"YOU LIE TO ME AGAIN, YOU NO LONGER HAVE AN ATTORNEY."
00:24:40.020,00:24:42.898,WHOEVER SLIPPED THE INFORMATION COULD BE A POSSIBLE SUSPECT.
00:24:42.898,00:24:44.317,ON IT.
00:24:42.898,00:24:46.819,"AND THE REST OF YOU, PROVE I WASN'T WRONG TO HIRE YOU."
00:24:47.861,00:24:50.197,Conner: I FORGOT.
00:24:50.197,00:24:54.994,"MY BOSS CALLED US INTO WORK LAST MINUTE, AND I'LL TAKE YOU TO DINNER THIS WEEKEND INSTEAD."
00:24:54.994,00:24:56.829,HELLO?
00:24:57.871,00:24:59.081,OLIVER?
00:25:00.624,00:25:02.126,BOYFRIEND DRAMA?
00:25:02.126,00:25:04.086,I DON'T DO BOYFRIENDS.
00:25:04.086,00:25:06.255,"WAIT, YOU'RE GAY?"
00:25:07.840,00:25:11.760,"HEY, BON."
00:25:11.760,00:25:13.053,YEAH.
00:25:13.053,00:25:14.554,SAM.
00:25:13.053,00:25:16.807,ABOUT YOUR STUDENT -- I JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY.
00:25:16.807,00:25:18.684,THANKS.
00:25:18.684,00:25:20.436,"IT'S BEEN A LITTLE ROUGH, TO BE HONEST."
00:25:22.021,00:25:23.605,"Annalise: OH, I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COME HOME."
00:25:23.605,00:25:25.523,HEY. I JUST WALKED IN.
00:25:25.523,00:25:29.862,REWORK THIS MOTION TO SUPPRESS.
00:25:41.165,00:25:42.875,HOW DID COURT GO?
00:25:45.336,00:25:48.130,WOW. THAT WELL?
00:25:48.130,00:25:50.632,MY CLIENT'S A LIAR.
00:25:54.552,00:25:56.680,IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO ASK ME?
00:25:56.680,00:25:58.057,HMM?
00:25:58.057,00:25:59.641,"THIS ISN'T YOUR COURTROOM, ANNIE."
00:25:59.641,00:26:01.060,"YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, SAY IT."
00:26:01.060,00:26:03.645,WERE YOU SCREWING HER?
00:26:03.645,00:26:05.314,YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
00:26:05.314,00:26:07.941,ABSOLUTELY NOT.
00:26:07.941,00:26:09.902,DO YOUR WORK.
00:26:13.030,00:26:15.282,GOOD EYE CONTACT.
00:26:15.282,00:26:16.450,NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING BELLIGERENT.
00:26:16.450,00:26:18.327,YOU'RE SURPRISED?
00:26:18.327,00:26:20.746,THAT MY WIFE THINKS THAT I SLEPT WITH ONE MY STUDENTS?
00:26:20.746,00:26:21.914,"WELL, SHE IS PRETTY."
00:26:21.914,00:26:23.581,SORRY. WAS.
00:26:23.581,00:26:25.251,"OH, GOD. LISTEN TO YOURSELF."
00:26:25.251,00:26:27.920,"WELL, SHOULDN'T I BE?"
00:26:36.720,00:26:38.347,COME HERE.
00:26:40.640,00:26:42.560,LOOK AT ME.
00:26:42.560,00:26:45.812,"ANNIE, LOOK AT ME."
00:26:48.774,00:26:52.610,THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON WITH ME AND THAT GIRL.
00:26:52.610,00:26:55.697,I SWEAR TO GOD.
00:26:59.034,00:27:01.661,I'M SORRY.
00:27:01.661,00:27:06.166,"IT'S -- IT'S JUST THIS CASE, THIS CLIENT."
00:27:07.793,00:27:10.963,I'M GONNA LOSE.
00:27:10.963,00:27:13.006,YOU SAY THAT EVERY TIME.
00:27:23.767,00:27:25.352,COME IN.
00:27:28.772,00:27:30.524,YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.
00:27:33.319,00:27:35.779,I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS TO IT.
00:27:39.116,00:27:41.743,Annalise: THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO WIN THIS CASE.
00:27:41.743,00:27:46.206,"WE PROVE THAT MAX, EVEN IF HE DID KILL HIS FIRST WIFE, DIDN'T KILL MARJORIE."
00:27:46.206,00:27:51.753,"USE THIS ROOM, LOOK FOR CLUES THAT WE MISSED, EVIDENCE THAT CONTRADICTS -- JUST GET INSIDE THE MURDERER'S HEAD."
00:27:55.966,00:27:59.345,WE CAN SWIPE THE ROOM FOR DNA AGAIN AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND ANOTHER SUSPECT.
00:27:59.345,00:28:00.846,WE ALREADY RAN MORE TESTS.
00:28:00.846,00:28:03.098,DID YOU NOT FULLY READ UP ON THE CASE?
00:28:04.475,00:28:07.394,Asher: LET'S PUT MAX ON THE STAND AND HAVE HIM CRY LIKE A LITTLE BABY.
00:28:10.772,00:28:12.690,ARGUE THE MATRIX DEFENSE.
00:28:13.859,00:28:15.819,Wes: SLEEPWALKING DEFENSE.
00:28:15.819,00:28:18.030,BATTERED HUSBAND SYNDROME.
00:28:19.239,00:28:20.574,BIPOLAR MOOD SWINGS.
00:28:20.574,00:28:22.493,HE'S A HUNTER.
00:28:22.493,00:28:23.869,AN MSG MASSACRE DEFENSE.
00:28:23.869,00:28:25.829,HE'S A HUNTER!
00:28:25.829,00:28:27.289,I THINK THE HEADS ON THE WALL MAKE THAT PRETTY OBVIOUS.
00:28:27.289,00:28:29.333,NO.
00:28:29.333,00:28:32.545,HE'S A HUNTER.
00:28:41.220,00:28:43.347,"OH, PRACTICALLY MY WHOLE LIFE."
00:28:43.347,00:28:46.850,"SO, YOU'RE EXPERIENCED AT SLAUGHTERING ANIMALS, THEN?"
00:28:46.850,00:28:53.773,"YES, IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS MY FATHER TAUGHT ME -- HOW TO BE HUMANE, TO MINIMIZE SUFFERING."
00:28:53.773,00:28:56.109,AND THERE ARE WAYS TO ENSURE THAT?
00:28:56.109,00:28:58.404,"I COULD SHOW YOU RIGHT NOW, IF YOU LIKE."
00:28:58.404,00:29:00.406,PLEASE.
00:29:08.747,00:29:15.128,"FIRST, YOU BEND THE NECK LIKE THIS SO THE CHIN IS CLOSE TO THE CHEST."
00:29:15.128,00:29:18.465,THEN YOU PUT THE KNIFE HERE -- Judge: MS. KEATING.
00:29:18.465,00:29:20.133,PLEASE EXPLAIN THE RELEVANCE OF THIS.
00:29:20.133,00:29:22.135,"IT'LL BECOME APPARENT, YOUR HONOR."
00:29:25.097,00:29:31.395,"ONCE THE KNIFE IS BY THE JUGULAR, YOU SLICE..."
00:29:32.979,00:29:45.284,"...IN ONE SWIFT MOTION, AND THEN, WELL, IT JUST BECOMES ABOUT WAITING FOR THE STILLNESS, WHICH HAPPENS QUITE FAST IF YOU'VE DONE IT CORRECTLY."
00:29:45.284,00:29:53.584,"AND THIS TECHNIQUE -- THIS VERY HUMANE, PAINLESS WAY OF KILLING AN ANIMAL -- IS THAT HOW YOU MURDERED YOUR FIRST WIFE?"
00:29:53.584,00:29:56.712,"YES, THAT'S CORRECT."
00:30:04.928,00:30:08.098,SHE'S GIVEN HER CLIENT BAD ADVICE IN ORDER TO GET A MISTRIAL.
00:30:08.098,00:30:09.808,WHO SAYS IT'S BAD ADVICE?
00:30:09.808,00:30:11.977,MY CLIENT WAS ACQUITTED OF THE FIRST MURDER.
00:30:11.977,00:30:13.353,IN SWITZERLAND.
00:30:13.353,00:30:18.525,"DOUBLE JEOPARDY STILL STANDS, AND IF YOU'D JUST LET ME PRESENT MY NEXT WITNESS, YOUR HONOR, YOU'LL SEE THE RELEVANCE OF ALL OF THIS."
00:30:18.525,00:30:20.152,REALLY?
00:30:20.152,00:30:22.738,THERE'S ACTUAL RELEVANCE TO THE THINGS YOU DO?
00:30:22.738,00:30:26.450,HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU BEEN CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER OF THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA?
00:30:26.450,00:30:28.285,13 YEARS.
00:30:26.450,00:30:30.078,I LEFT LAST MAY TO BECOME CHIEF OF PATHOLOGY AT PENN STATE.
00:30:30.078,00:30:34.166,AND YOU'VE STUDIED THE AUTOPSY REPORTS OF BOTH ELIZABETH SIMS AND MARJORIE ST. VINCENT.
00:30:34.166,00:30:37.169,CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO MURDERS?
00:30:37.169,00:30:40.255,"WELL, AT FIRST BLUSH, THEY LOOK QUITE SIMILAR."
00:30:40.255,00:30:49.765,"BUT A MORE IN-DEPTH REVIEW OF THE REPORTS INDICATES THAT THE FIRST MURDER, A LACERATION ACROSS THE NECK, WAS DONE BY SOMEONE WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY."
00:30:49.765,00:30:51.558,AND THE SECOND MURDER?
00:30:51.558,00:30:54.812,"THE NUMEROUS SHARP INJURIES WERE MESSY, INACCURATE."
00:30:54.812,00:30:56.438,THEY HIT BONE.
00:30:56.438,00:30:58.774,THE KILLER CLEARLY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ANATOMY.
00:30:58.774,00:31:02.778,MEANING THE SECOND KILLER PROBABLY DID NOT HAVE HUNTING EXPERIENCE.
00:31:02.778,00:31:04.196,DEFINITELY NOT.
00:31:04.196,00:31:10.744,"IN FACT, IT IS MY EXPERT OPINION THAT THERE'S NO WAY THAT THESE TWO WOMEN WERE KILLED BY THE SAME PERSON."
00:31:10.744,00:31:12.788,THE DEFENSE RESTS.
00:31:12.788,00:31:15.040,Wes: I THINK I KNOW WHO THE SECOND MURDERER WAS.
00:31:15.040,00:31:16.875,OH?
00:31:16.875,00:31:19.586,THE SUPPLEMENTAL ARREST REPORT SAID THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY.
00:31:19.586,00:31:21.463,WHO ELSE WOULD HAVE A KEY?
00:31:21.463,00:31:25.801,"SO MAYBE SHE FOUND OUT THE TRUTH BEFORE WE DID -- THAT MAX KILLED HER MOTHER, THEN STABBED MARJORIE TO FRAME HIM."
00:31:25.801,00:31:29.262,INTERESTING THEORY.
00:31:29.262,00:31:30.930,YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.
00:31:33.767,00:31:37.771,I GOT THE I.P. ADDRESS OF THE COMPUTER THAT E-MAILED THE D.A.
00:31:37.771,00:31:39.981,CAME FROM A STANFORD COMPUTER LAB.
00:31:39.981,00:31:41.525,ELOISE.
00:31:41.525,00:31:49.157,"SHE SPENT SPRING BREAK VISITING HER MOM'S HOMETOWN IN SWITZERLAND, DUG UP THE REAL STORY HOW SHE DIED, STARTED PLOTTING HER REVENGE."
00:31:49.157,00:31:52.786,"LIKE FATHER, LIKE DAUGHTER."
00:31:52.786,00:31:54.246,BUT WHAT IF IT'S TRUE?
00:31:54.246,00:31:55.748,"WE'VE RESTED OUR CASE, MR. GIBBONS."
00:31:55.748,00:31:57.123,NOW WE WAIT FOR THE VERDICT.
00:31:57.123,00:31:58.500,LAUREL.
00:32:00.794,00:32:03.463,SPEAK UP MORE.
00:32:03.463,00:32:06.759,AND WATCH OUT FOR MR. GIBBONS AND MISS CASTILLO HERE.
00:32:06.759,00:32:09.511,QUIET ONES ARE USUALLY THE MOST DANGEROUS.
00:32:11.221,00:32:13.306,WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?
00:32:16.518,00:32:18.144,TOLD YOU I HAD GOOD TASTE.
00:32:18.144,00:32:19.438,WE'RE NOT HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN.
00:32:19.438,00:32:21.231,I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING.
00:32:21.231,00:32:24.693,"BESIDES, YOU'RE THE ONE WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT."
00:32:24.693,00:32:26.278,WHAT?
00:32:26.278,00:32:29.072,YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THAT HOUSE WHO NOTICES THINGS?
00:32:33.410,00:32:35.454,Judge: HAVE YOU REACHED A VERDICT?
00:32:35.454,00:32:37.122,"Man: WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR."
00:32:37.122,00:32:51.136,"IN THE MATTER OF COMMONWEALTH vs. ST. VINCENT, CASE NUMBER P1082971, WE, THE JURY, FIND THE DEFENDANT, MAXWELL ST. VINCENT..."
00:32:51.136,00:32:53.263,NOT GUILTY.
00:32:53.263,00:32:56.433,"YOU GOT AWAY WITH MURDER, YOU PIG!"
00:33:06.860,00:33:10.447,"OKAY, I DON'T LIKE THIS PART."
00:33:10.447,00:33:12.616,"YOU KNOW, THERE WAS AN EASIER WAY TO DO THIS."
00:33:12.616,00:33:14.159,YOU MEAN THROW HER TO THE WOLVES?
00:33:14.159,00:33:16.119,YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN.
00:33:19.498,00:33:23.251,"SHE KILLED YOUR WIFE, A WOMAN THAT YOU APPARENTLY LOVED."
00:33:23.251,00:33:25.712,AND I'LL FIND A WAY TO PUNISH ELLIE FOR THAT.
00:33:25.712,00:33:27.923,DON'T YOU WORRY.
00:33:27.923,00:33:29.842,YOU THINK I MEAN KILL HER?
00:33:29.842,00:33:32.260,"NO, MS. KEATING."
00:33:32.260,00:33:36.473,I'D RATHER NOT SPEND MY ENTIRE INHERITANCE PAYING YOUR LEGAL BILLS.
00:33:37.891,00:33:42.228,"WELL, I SHOULDN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES."
00:33:44.481,00:33:46.399,NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME.
00:33:46.399,00:33:47.651,"NO, IT'S OKAY."
00:34:01.414,00:34:04.793,NO. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR BOSS NEEDS.
00:34:04.793,00:34:08.129,I'M NOT HERE FOR WORK.
00:34:08.129,00:34:10.048,YOU REALLY THINK I'M THAT DESPERATE?
00:34:10.048,00:34:15.053,THAT YOU CAN BUY ME SOME TAKEOUT AND BAT YOUR EYES AND I'LL GET DOWN ON MY KNEES LIKE SOME SAD TWINK.
00:34:15.053,00:34:17.556,YOU'RE TOO OLD TO BE A TWINK.
00:34:25.022,00:34:26.648,OKAY.
00:34:26.648,00:34:28.066,"BUT TONIGHT, I DO YOU."
00:34:50.505,00:34:51.965,SAM?
00:34:53.174,00:34:54.634,Sam: IN HERE.
00:34:58.555,00:35:00.599,WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
00:35:00.599,00:35:05.645,"WE ARE CELEBRATING YOUR WIN, WHICH, LET ME JUST SAY -- YOU PREDICTED."
00:35:08.815,00:35:10.567,HERE. SIT.
00:35:10.567,00:35:14.571,I'M GONNA HEAD TO THE CELLAR AND GET US A BOTTLE.
00:35:14.571,00:35:17.115,DON'T MOVE.
00:35:57.447,00:35:59.616,ANNIE?
00:36:02.285,00:36:05.622,I FOUND A BOTTLE TED AND LEAH GAVE US FOR OUR 20th.
00:36:05.622,00:36:07.332,WHERE YOU GOING?
00:36:07.332,00:36:08.750,I HAVE A CLIENT WHO JUST CALLED ME FROM JAIL.
00:36:08.750,00:36:10.836,I'LL BE HOME AS SOON AS I CAN.
00:36:28.269,00:36:30.063,NIA'S INSIDE.
00:36:30.063,00:36:31.690,I JUST NEED A MINUTE.
00:36:31.690,00:36:33.483,IT'S ABOUT THE LILA STANGARD MURDER.
00:36:35.986,00:36:37.403,IT'S NOT MY CASE.
00:36:37.403,00:36:38.780,I TOLD YOU -- I'M ON PROBATION.
00:36:38.780,00:36:40.323,I KNOW.
00:36:40.323,00:36:42.868,BUT SAM KNEW HER.
00:36:42.868,00:36:45.120,THEY WERE CLOSE.
00:36:54.754,00:36:57.090,HEY.
00:36:57.090,00:37:00.719,FINE. GOT HIM OUT ON A MISDEMEANOR.
00:37:02.179,00:37:03.471,ANNIE.
00:37:03.471,00:37:06.599,HMM?
00:37:06.599,00:37:10.687,"'CAUSE IF WE'RE NOT, I'D RATHER TALK ABOUT IT."
00:37:10.687,00:37:14.315,I PROMISE IT WON'T BE AS SCARY AS YOU THINK.
00:37:22.199,00:37:24.242,ANNIE.
00:37:29.915,00:37:32.417,WE'RE GOOD.
00:37:46.890,00:37:48.433,THEY WERE CLOSE.
00:37:48.433,00:37:50.143,THEY WERE CLOSE.
00:37:50.143,00:37:51.728,YOU SERIOUS?
00:37:51.728,00:37:52.896,YOU THINK HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT?
00:37:52.896,00:37:54.355,I DON'T KNOW.
00:37:54.355,00:37:55.565,BECAUSE SHE WAS HIS STUDENT?
00:37:55.565,00:37:57.025,THAT'S YOUR CASE?
00:37:57.025,00:37:58.443,ONE OF HIS CLOSEST STUDENTS.
00:37:58.443,00:38:00.820,WHICH MEANS HE'D SCREW HER.
00:38:00.820,00:38:02.447,BUT KILL HER?
00:38:02.447,00:38:04.991,"WE'RE ALL CAPABLE OF TERRIBLE THINGS, NATE."
00:38:04.991,00:38:06.618,THIS IS YOUR JOB TALKING.
00:38:06.618,00:38:09.913,IT'S MAKING YOU SEE BAD WHERE THERE IS NONE.
00:38:09.913,00:38:12.540,"BUT YOU GOT TO STOP, GO HOME, AND TALK TO HIM."
00:38:12.540,00:38:14.667,HE TOLD ME NOTHING HAPPENED.
00:38:14.667,00:38:17.629,THEN THERE'S YOUR ANSWER.
00:38:17.629,00:38:20.298,"HOW MANY TIMES HAS NIA ASKED YOU THOSE SAME QUESTIONS, HUH?"
00:38:20.298,00:38:22.508,AND WHAT DID YOU TELL HER ABOUT US?
00:38:22.508,00:38:24.177,THE TRUTH?
00:38:30.934,00:38:33.186,"HE'S MY HUSBAND, NATE -- MY HUSBAND!"
00:38:33.186,00:38:34.687,EXACTLY.
00:38:34.687,00:38:39.400,YOU DON'T DO THIS TO YOUR HUSBAND -- SELL HIM OUT TO YOUR BOYFRIEND.
00:38:41.069,00:38:43.280,I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT AGAIN.
00:38:43.280,00:38:45.198,NATE!
00:38:49.995,00:38:56.876,"HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AT YALE THE NIGHT SHE WAS KILLED, AND I NEED FOR YOU TO TELL ME THAT HE WAS THERE, THAT HIS ALIBI CHECKS OUT."
00:38:56.876,00:38:59.171,"IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO STOP MY MIND, ALL RIGHT?"
00:38:59.171,00:39:02.174,TO KNOW FOR SURE THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
00:39:02.174,00:39:03.633,"PLEASE, NATE."
00:39:03.633,00:39:05.302,I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO GO TO.
00:39:05.302,00:39:07.553,"I WISH IT WERE SOMEONE ELSE, BUT IT'S YOU."
00:39:07.553,00:39:08.763,I NEED YOU.

00:42:01.560,00:42:02.770,IT'S DONE.

00:00:16.391,00:00:18.059,IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE!
00:00:18.101,00:00:19.979,THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON WITH ME AND THAT GIRL.
00:00:20.020,00:00:23.148,IT'S ABOUT THE LILA STANGARD MURDER. SAM KNEW HER.

00:00:36.537,00:00:38.246,IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO DESTROY THE DNA.
00:00:39.790,00:00:42.459,"REBECCA, IT'S DONE."
00:01:07.234,00:01:09.778,"MICHAELA, STAND UP."
00:01:09.820,00:01:11.655,WE NEED TO LEAVE.
00:01:12.865,00:01:14.616,"Laurel: CONNOR, STOP!"
00:01:14.658,00:01:18.245,WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW.
00:01:18.286,00:01:21.999,MICHAELA. LOOK AT ME.
00:01:22.041,00:01:23.458,EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.
00:01:23.500,00:01:25.252,Connor: SHE'S NOT FINE.
00:01:25.293,00:01:28.129,HER LITTLE PERFECT BRAIN CAN'T HANDLE THIS.
00:01:31.675,00:01:33.010,MICHAELA?
00:01:52.487,00:01:54.239,OOH.
00:01:54.281,00:02:00.662,"WHY DON'T I QUIT MY JOB, MOVE TO PHILLY, AND I CAN BE YOUR TROPHY WIFE?"
00:02:02.247,00:02:04.750,BECAUSE I'M NOT MARRYING A LOSER.
00:02:04.792,00:02:07.419,"WELL, I'D STILL BE ME."
00:02:07.461,00:02:12.591,"I'D JUST HAVE, YOU KNOW, MORE TIME ON MY HANDS SO I CAN COOK US DINNER..."
00:02:12.633,00:02:14.426,...AND I CAN TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS.
00:02:14.468,00:02:16.637,AH. KID. ONE.
00:02:16.678,00:02:21.141,AND...THE NANNY WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.
00:02:23.518,00:02:25.228,AND THE CHEF WILL COOK US DINNER.
00:02:25.270,00:02:28.231,AND YOU AND I WILL TAKE OVER THE WORLD.
00:02:28.273,00:02:30.191,OH.
00:02:34.571,00:02:37.074,OHH.
00:02:37.116,00:02:38.784,I HAVE TO GET TO THE OFFICE.
00:02:38.826,00:02:40.160,WE'RE PICKING UP A NEW CLIENT AT THE JAIL.
00:02:40.201,00:02:41.954,I JUST GOT HERE.
00:02:41.996,00:02:43.914,PROFESSOR KEATING DOESN'T CARE.
00:02:43.956,00:02:45.749,"ALL RIGHT, WELL, AT LEAST LET ME WALK YOU TO THE OFFICE."
00:02:45.791,00:02:47.292,"WHAT AM I, 10 YEARS OLD?"
00:02:47.334,00:02:48.836,DO YOU NOT WATCH THE NEWS?
00:02:48.877,00:02:50.129,STUDENTS ARE GETTING MURDERED OUT THERE.
00:03:03.391,00:03:08.772,"Reporter: THE TWO SUSPECTS, GRIFFIN O'REILLY AND REBECCA SUTTER, WERE ARRESTED WITHIN AN HOUR OF EACH OTHER."
00:03:08.814,00:03:13.110,"HI, I'M LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ON SOMEONE IN CUSTODY NAMED REBECCA SUTTER."
00:03:13.152,00:03:14.361,PRESS?
00:03:14.402,00:03:16.071,ARE YOU PRESS OR A LAWYER?
00:03:16.113,00:03:17.698,"IF YOU'RE WITH THE PRESS, PISS OFF."
00:03:17.739,00:03:19.700,"IF YOU'RE A LAWYER, I NEED TO SEE I.D."
00:03:44.432,00:03:50.313,BUT I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US IN THE ADMINISTRATION WHEN I SAY WE STAND BEHIND GRIFFIN O'REILLY AND WE BELIEVE IN HIS INNOCENCE.
00:03:50.355,00:03:53.483,"THANKFULLY, HE POSTED BAIL AND WAS RELEASED THIS MORNING."
00:03:53.525,00:03:55.443,"HE'S A GREAT KID, LIVES A CLEAN LIFE."
00:03:55.485,00:03:59.447,"OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE OFFICIALLY CANNOT TAKE A POSITION IN HIS TRIAL."
00:03:59.489,00:04:04.452,BECAUSE THE VICTIM'S FAMILY'S DONATED MORE THAN $8 MILLION TO THE UNIVERSITY LAST YEAR ALONE.
00:04:04.494,00:04:11.001,"BUT, THEN, HAVING THE STAR QUARTERBACK CONVICTED OF MURDER DOES UNTOLD HARM TO THE ENTIRE SPORTS PROGRAM."
00:04:11.043,00:04:22.888,"ANNALISE, YOU AND SAM HAVE BEEN GREAT ASSETS TO US HERE, AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY YOU'VE RECEIVED A GENEROUS COMPENSATION PACKAGE AND UNPRECEDENTED FREEDOM IN CONDUCTING YOUR CLASSES WITH VIRTUALLY NO OVERSIGHT."
00:04:22.930,00:04:24.431,I BRING STUDENTS HERE AS A RESULT.
00:04:24.472,00:04:25.766,"YES, WE KNOW THAT."
00:04:25.807,00:04:27.392,BUT WE HAVEN'T ASKED FOR MUCH.
00:04:27.434,00:04:30.187,BUT YOU'RE ASKING NOW.
00:04:31.563,00:04:34.274,WE NEED YOU TO REPRESENT MR. O'REILLY.
00:04:38.028,00:04:39.988,I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
00:04:43.450,00:04:45.326,IT'S ME.
00:04:45.368,00:04:46.494,I'M ON PROBATION.
00:04:46.536,00:04:47.996,YOU CAN'T BE CALLING ME.
00:04:53.668,00:04:55.670,I CAN'T GIVE THEM AN ANSWER UNTIL I KNOW ABOUT SAM.
00:04:55.712,00:04:58.548,"I'M IN NEW HAVEN RIGHT NOW, CHECKING HIS ALIBI."
00:04:58.590,00:05:00.175,I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I KNOW SOMETHING.
00:05:05.055,00:05:06.848,HI.
00:05:06.890,00:05:09.226,ARE YOU NATALIE FROM THE YALE PSYCH DEPARTMENT?
00:05:09.268,00:05:10.769,DO I KNOW YOU?
00:05:10.811,00:05:12.687,YOUR CO-WORKER SAID I'D FIND YOU HERE.
00:05:12.729,00:05:17.151,THERE WAS A LECTURE YOU SCHEDULED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO FEATURING A PROFESSOR UP FROM PHILLY.
00:05:17.192,00:05:18.819,"OH, DR. SAM KEATING, RIGHT."
00:05:18.860,00:05:22.030,I WAS WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT HAVE A COPY OF THE LECTURE ON VIDEO.
00:05:22.072,00:05:23.615,WE DIDN'T TAPE ANYTHING THAT NIGHT.
00:05:23.657,00:05:26.660,"AND IF WE DID, IT WOULD BE PRETTY DULL."
00:05:26.701,00:05:28.870,DR. KEATING DIDN'T SHOW.
00:05:28.912,00:05:30.747,REALLY?
00:05:30.789,00:05:33.834,"HE SAID HE HAD FOOD POISONING, CANCELED LAST MINUTE."
00:05:33.875,00:05:35.836,"REALLY TICKED OFF DEAN REYNOLDS, TOO."
00:05:35.877,00:05:41.216,"SHE'D BEEN WOOING DR. KEATING FOR A POSITION HERE, BUT AFTER GETTING BLOWN OFF LIKE THAT..."
00:05:52.393,00:05:54.353,PROFESSOR KEATING. HI.
00:05:54.395,00:05:56.355,"THIS IS MY FIANCé, AIDEN WALKER."
00:05:56.397,00:05:58.399,HE WORKS FOR THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK.
00:05:58.441,00:06:02.070,MICHAELA SPEAKS VERY HIGHLY OF YOU.
00:06:03.404,00:06:04.990,DON'T BE LATE AGAIN.
00:06:08.160,00:06:09.494,"SO, SHE'S NOT EXACTLY WARM."
00:06:09.536,00:06:10.996,"THIS HIM, FUTURE HUBBY?"
00:06:14.166,00:06:15.374,LAUREL.
00:06:15.416,00:06:18.503,AIDEN FREAKIN' WALKER.
00:06:18.545,00:06:19.462,CONNOR WALSH?!
00:06:20.922,00:06:22.257,"OH, MY GOD!"
00:06:22.299,00:06:23.925,YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?
00:06:23.967,00:06:25.344,YEAH! WE -- WE WENT TO BOARDING SCHOOL TOGETHER.
00:06:25.384,00:06:27.386,"SO GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN."
00:06:27.428,00:06:28.429,"SO, THIS IS YOUR FIANCé."
00:06:28.471,00:06:30.182,YEP.
00:06:30.224,00:06:32.809,GUESS WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN I THOUGHT.
00:06:38.023,00:06:40.067,OFFICER NELSON.
00:06:44.946,00:06:49.408,"HEY, THAT I.T. GUY YOU KNOW -- YOU THINK HE'D BE ABLE TO UNLOCK A PHONE?"
00:06:49.450,00:06:51.410,"ARE YOU BECOMING A HACKER, WAITLIST?"
00:06:51.452,00:06:54.455,WHO FORGOT HIS PASS CODE.
00:06:54.497,00:06:55.665,REALLY?
00:06:55.707,00:06:57.334,YOU HAVE A FRIEND?
00:06:57.376,00:06:59.544,LOOK WHO'S HERE -- PROFESSOR KEATING.
00:06:59.586,00:07:01.546,YOU HAVE A CLIENT OF MINE IN LOCKUP -- PAULA MURPHY.
00:07:01.588,00:07:03.590,SEX IN THE PARK LADY.
00:07:03.631,00:07:06.218,THAT'S IT? OUR HOT NEW CASE IS SOME HOOKER IN A PARK?
00:07:06.260,00:07:07.719,SHE'S A FRIEND OF A FRIEND.
00:07:07.761,00:07:09.470,NOT EVERY CASE IS A SERIAL KILLER.
00:07:09.512,00:07:14.726,"YOU WANT TO BE PROFESSOR KEATING ONE DAY, YOU BUILD A CLIENT BASE FROM THE GROUND UP, SO SHUT UP AND LEARN."
00:07:19.022,00:07:21.775,"WHOA, THAT IS NOT A HOOKER, THAT'S A MOM."
00:07:21.816,00:07:23.443,GENIUS.
00:07:23.484,00:07:24.945,"MRS. MURPHY, I'M ANNALISE KEATING."
00:07:24.986,00:07:26.446,"OH, THANK GOD."
00:07:26.487,00:07:29.532,I DON'T KNOW HOW I'LL EVER REPAY YOU -- THIS WAY.
00:07:29.574,00:07:30.700,I'VE NEVER NEEDED A LAWYER BEFORE.
00:07:30.742,00:07:34.204,I WAS SO GRATEFUL THAT CHERYL OFFERED TO PUT ME IN TOUCH WITH YOU.
00:07:34.246,00:07:35.705,"WELL, CHERYL IS A LONG-TIME CLIENT OF MINE."
00:07:35.747,00:07:36.831,I'M GLAD I CAN BE OF SOME HELP.
00:07:36.873,00:07:38.458,I AM SO ASHAMED.
00:07:38.499,00:07:39.876,THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF THING I USUALLY DO.
00:07:39.918,00:07:41.502,THE CHARGES HAVE BEEN DROPPED.
00:07:41.544,00:07:43.255,IT'S BEEN CLEARED FROM YOUR RECORD.
00:07:43.297,00:07:45.673,"NO ONE WILL KNOW, INCLUDING YOUR HUSBAND."
00:07:51.972,00:07:54.224,"ELENA AGUILAR, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST."
00:07:54.266,00:07:55.600,EXCUSE ME?
00:07:55.642,00:07:57.185,HER NAME'S ELENA AGUILAR.
00:07:57.227,00:08:02.316,SHE'S A FUGITIVE WANTED FOR FELONY MURDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE 1994 BOMBING OF THE WORLD FINANCIAL INSTITUTE.
00:08:12.117,00:08:14.619,HOOKER MOM TURNED OUT TO BE BOMB MOM.
00:08:14.661,00:08:15.954,I FREAKIN' LOVE THIS JOB.
00:08:15.996,00:08:19.416,Shh. HER KIDS ARE RIGHT THERE.
00:08:19.458,00:08:23.295,"IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT SECRETS AIDEN MIGHT BE KEEPING FROM YOU, RIGHT?"
00:08:23.337,00:08:30.969,"Bonnie: THERE WERE FIVE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE BOMBING IN 1994, ALL MEMBERS OF THE ANTI-GLOBALIZATION GROUP KNOWN AS THE RED LETTER BRIGADE."
00:08:31.011,00:08:33.721,TWO SERVED TIME.
00:08:33.763,00:08:41.104,"THEIR LEADER, GABRIEL SHAW, REMAINS INCARCERATED, AND ELENA AGUILAR DISAPPEARED AFTER POSTING BAIL."
00:08:41.146,00:08:43.731,AND THEY THINK PAULA IS THIS...ELENA?
00:08:43.773,00:08:45.650,"THEIR FINGERPRINTS MATCH, YES."
00:08:45.692,00:08:49.321,FINGERPRINTS THAT THEY TOOK BECAUSE SHE WAS CAUGHT GIVING...MANUAL PLEASURE TO A STRANGER IN A PARK?
00:08:49.363,00:08:51.239,KEVIN!
00:08:51.281,00:08:54.993,"UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME THAT THIS IS ALL A BIG MISTAKE, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY RIGHT NOW."
00:08:55.035,00:08:57.204,Bonnie: THE EVIDENCE AGAINST PAULA IS QUITE DAMNING.
00:08:57.245,00:09:00.540,IT'S HER FINGERPRINT THEY FOUND ON A FRAGMENT OF THE PIPE BOMB THAT EXPLODED AND KILLED A JANITOR.
00:09:00.581,00:09:02.209,HE DIED?
00:09:02.250,00:09:03.668,IT WAS MEANT TO GO OFF WHEN NO ONE WAS AROUND.
00:09:03.710,00:09:04.752,YOU DID THIS?
00:09:04.794,00:09:07.088,THIS IS ALL TRUE?
00:09:07.130,00:09:09.132,"Annalise: IT'S A LOT TO PROCESS, I KNOW, BUT WE HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE."
00:09:09.174,00:09:12.719,THE GOVERNMENT OFFERED A PLEA DEAL -- 10 YEARS.
00:09:12.760,00:09:14.929,THEY NEED AN ANSWER IN ONE HOUR.
00:09:14.971,00:09:15.972,10 YEARS?!
00:09:17.349,00:09:18.892,WE SHOULD TAKE IT.
00:09:18.933,00:09:20.310,A MAN DIED.
00:09:20.352,00:09:21.853,IT'S NOT THAT LONG OF A TIME.
00:09:21.895,00:09:23.688,IT IS A LONG TIME.
00:09:23.730,00:09:25.399,YOUR DAUGHTERS ARE GONNA GROW UP WITHOUT YOU.
00:09:25.440,00:09:27.692,IT'S GONNA DESTROY YOUR FAMILY.
00:09:29.652,00:09:31.988,I THINK THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN WIN THIS.
00:09:33.323,00:09:36.326,WE CAN WIN THIS.
00:09:36.368,00:09:38.495,MAKE SURE THE DAUGHTERS ARE IN COURT.
00:09:38.537,00:09:39.996,THAT'S GOLD FOR THE JURY.
00:09:40.038,00:09:42.123,WHEN'S THE BAIL HEARING?
00:09:42.165,00:09:43.750,THE FORENSICS EXPERT?
00:09:43.791,00:09:45.293,WHAT CAN HE SAY TO HELP?
00:09:45.335,00:09:46.836,HER FINGERPRINT'S ON THE BOMB FRAGMENT.
00:09:46.878,00:09:48.755,EXACTLY. THERE'S NO WAY TO WIN THIS.
00:09:51.049,00:09:53.843,WHAT? YOU SAID THAT WE COULD HAND IT IN WHENEVER WE WANTED.
00:09:53.885,00:09:55.762,THAT WAS BEFORE YOU DOUBTED MY ABILITIES.
00:09:55.803,00:09:57.347,I'M JUST SAYING THAT WE HAVE NO DEFENSE.
00:09:57.389,00:09:59.891,WHO SAYS I DON'T HAVE ONE?
00:09:59.933,00:10:05.230,UNITED STATES v. HEARST -- WHO CAN TELL ME THE FACTS?
00:10:05.272,00:10:07.107,MR. GIBBINS.
00:10:07.148,00:10:11.069,"Wes: PATTY HEARST, HEIRESS TO THE HEARST CORPORATION, WAS CHARGED WITH ARMED BANK ROBBERY."
00:10:11.111,00:10:18.535,HER LAWYERS ARGUED A TWO-PRONGED DEFENSE -- THAT SHE WAS BOTH BRAINWASHED AND COERCED BY HER KIDNAPPERS AT THE SYMBIONESE LIBERATION ARMY.
00:10:18.577,00:10:19.744,DID THE DEFENSE WORK?
00:10:19.786,00:10:24.249,THE PROSECUTION ARGUED THAT SHE COULD NOT BE BOTH UNDER DURESS AND BRAINWASHED.
00:10:24.291,00:10:27.335,WE WERE OCCUPY BEFORE THERE WAS OCCUPY.
00:10:27.377,00:10:33.091,"BIG-BANK GREED, MISDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH -- WE WERE AGAINST THAT STUFF YEARS AGO."
00:10:33.133,00:10:36.052,"AND PAULA -- OR ELENA, AS YOU KNEW HER -- SHE ESPOUSED THESE BELIEFS, AS WELL?"
00:10:36.094,00:10:37.637,"HELLS, YEAH."
00:10:37.678,00:10:40.765,ELENA LIKED TO RAGE AGAINST THE WEALTH MACHINE AS MUCH AS ANY OF US.
00:10:40.807,00:10:44.936,WHO CAN TELL ME THE FIRST KEY TO A MIND-CONTROL DEFENSE?
00:10:46.605,00:10:47.855,MS. CASTILLO?
00:10:47.897,00:10:51.692,"ESTABLISHING A BRAINWASHER, A MASTERMIND YOU CAN PIN THE CRIME ON."
00:10:51.734,00:11:00.743,"MR. DAVIS, WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF YOUR GROUP'S CHARISMATIC LEADER, GABRIEL SHAW?"
00:11:00.785,00:11:02.287,Davis: YOU MAKE HIM SOUND LIKE A CULT LEADER.
00:11:02.329,00:11:03.538,"YOUR WORDS, NOT MINE."
00:11:03.580,00:11:06.458,"GABRIEL IS VERY PERSUASIVE, BUT HE NEVER MADE US DO ANYTHING WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO."
00:11:06.500,00:11:07.917,REALLY?
00:11:07.959,00:11:11.045,DIDN'T HE ONCE KEEP FOOD FROM THE GROUP FOR SEVEN STRAIGHT DAYS?
00:11:11.087,00:11:12.547,WE WERE FASTING.
00:11:12.589,00:11:16.926,"IT'S CALLED FOOD DEPRIVATION, AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS IN MIND CONTROL."
00:11:16.968,00:11:20.221,AND ONCE A RINGLEADER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED?
00:11:22.599,00:11:23.933,MS. PRATT.
00:11:23.975,00:11:30.898,"ESTABLISH THAT THE ILLEGAL ACT WAS CONCEIVED WHOLLY AND ORIGINALLY BY THE RINGLEADER, THAT IT WAS HIS IDEA ALONE."
00:11:32.609,00:11:35.654,"AND THIS PLAN TO PLANT THE PIPE BOMB WAS GABRIEL'S ENTIRELY, WASN'T IT?"
00:11:35.694,00:11:37.696,OBJECTION -- HEARSAY.
00:11:39.782,00:11:42.035,DID HE CONSULT ANY OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP?
00:11:42.076,00:11:43.995,NOTHING FURTHER.
00:11:44.037,00:11:45.372,"FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, I DO THINK ELENA SHOULD GO TO JAIL."
00:11:45.413,00:11:46.998,MOTION TO STRIKE!
00:11:47.040,00:11:48.625,WE ALL SERVED OUR TIME.
00:11:48.667,00:11:50.084,YOUR HONOR?
00:11:50.126,00:11:51.878,WHERE ARE WE IN FINDING GABRIEL?
00:11:51.919,00:11:53.880,THE FEDS ARE HIDING HIM IN THE PRISON SYSTEM.
00:11:53.921,00:11:57.592,"I WAS THINKING IF I DRAFTED A MOTION FOR DISCLOSURE -- LEAVE THE LAWYERING TO THE ACTUAL LAWYERS, FRANK."
00:11:57.634,00:11:59.344,JUST FIND A WAY TO TRACK HIM DOWN.
00:11:59.386,00:12:01.221,UH...
00:12:01.262,00:12:03.431,"PROFESSOR KEATING, HOW ABOUT IF I HELP FRANK WITH THAT?"
00:12:04.807,00:12:14.693,"GABRIEL SHAW HAS BEEN IN PERFECT HEALTH FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS -- THAT IS, UNTIL HE WAS CONVENIENTLY HOSPITALIZED IN THE ALLENTOWN FEDERAL PRISON JUST ONE DAY AFTER THE A.U.S.A. INTERVIEWED HIM ABOUT THIS CASE."
00:12:14.733,00:12:16.194,THE DIAGNOSIS -- UNDETERMINED.
00:12:16.236,00:12:19.072,THEY'RE FAKING SICK.
00:12:19.113,00:12:20.699,THEY DON'T WANT THE JURY TO HEAR WHATEVER HE HAS TO SAY.
00:12:20.739,00:12:22.283,WHERE'D YOU GET THIS FROM?
00:12:22.325,00:12:23.868,"I HAVE, UH...SOURCES."
00:12:23.910,00:12:25.245,YOU MEAN YOUR DADDY?
00:12:25.286,00:12:27.121,"WHOEVER IT WAS, IT WORKED."
00:12:27.163,00:12:29.249,"MAKE ROOM ON YOUR MANTEL FOR THE TROPHY, MR. MILLSTONE."
00:12:30.458,00:12:31.959,Yeah.
00:12:34.753,00:12:38.717,"WE CAN DRIVE TO THE PRISON IN THE MORNING, TALK TO MR. SHAW."
00:12:38.757,00:12:43.346,"PAULA, I WANT YOU TO COME, PERSUADE HIM TO TESTIFY ON YOUR BEHALF."
00:12:43.388,00:12:46.349,YOU MEAN SEE HIM?
00:12:46.391,00:12:48.059,IS THAT A GOOD IDEA?
00:12:48.101,00:12:50.353,HE'S BEHIND BARS.
00:12:50.395,00:12:52.313,I'M SORRY.
00:12:52.355,00:12:54.608,I'M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF SEEING HIM.
00:12:54.649,00:12:56.817,"TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK, I'M NOT CONCERNED IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE OR NOT."
00:12:56.859,00:12:58.903,WE NEED HIS TESTIMONY.
00:13:09.956,00:13:12.417,"OKAY, IF FRANK'S NOT A LAWYER, THEN WHAT IS HE?"
00:13:12.459,00:13:14.419,IS HE ANNALISE'S BODYGUARD?
00:13:14.461,00:13:16.170,"WHATEVER HE IS, I'M GLAD THERE'S SOME EYE CANDY AROUND HERE."
00:13:16.212,00:13:18.797,WHAT ABOUT ME?
00:13:18.839,00:13:20.759,AIDEN IS EYE CANDY.
00:13:20.799,00:13:22.636,YOU ARE MEATLOAF.

00:13:24.638,00:13:26.306,MY TROPHY. AND I NEVER BELIEVED HE WAS A LAWYER.
00:13:26.347,00:13:27.974,WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
00:13:29.934,00:13:31.603,WHICH MEANS WHAT?
00:13:31.645,00:13:35.607,OR YOU'RE A CLASSIST ELITIST WHO THINKS EVERYONE WHO DIDN'T GO TO AN IVY IS BENEATH YOU?
00:13:35.649,00:13:37.317,"WELL, THAT'S JUST TRUE."
00:13:37.358,00:13:38.777,"O.M.G., DO YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON HIM?"
00:13:38.817,00:13:40.320,YOU TOTALLY DO.
00:13:40.361,00:13:41.571,COULD SOMEONE ANSWER THEIR DAMN PHONE?
00:13:41.613,00:13:43.448,"WES, IT'S YOUR BAG."
00:13:53.625,00:13:54.959,HELLO?
00:13:55.001,00:13:57.086,MAN: Who is this?

00:14:02.467,00:14:04.678,"Dude gave me her number, said she could hook me up."
00:14:04.719,00:14:05.804,Is she there?
00:14:05.844,00:14:08.389,Hello?

00:14:40.672,00:14:44.967,Michaela: NO. THIS MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.
00:14:45.009,00:14:46.427,"WE GO BACK FOR THE BODY, AND THEN WHAT?"
00:14:46.469,00:14:47.970,WE DO WHAT WITH IT?
00:14:48.012,00:14:49.055,HAVE ANY OF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?
00:14:49.096,00:14:50.598,WE BURN IT.
00:14:50.640,00:14:51.808,"OH, PLEASE."
00:14:51.850,00:14:53.518,YOU NEED AN INCINERATOR.
00:14:53.560,00:14:55.311,BUT AT LEAST WE'LL GET RID OF OUR DNA.
00:14:55.353,00:14:56.896,Connor: AND THE BONFIRE WILL COVER THE SMOKE.
00:14:56.937,00:14:58.398,IT'S -- IT'S KIND OF A PERFECT PLAN.
00:14:58.439,00:15:00.274,Michaela: PERFECT?
00:15:00.316,00:15:01.359,PERFECT ABOUT THIS PLAN.

00:15:49.990,00:15:52.535,SMILE OR GO TO JAIL!
00:16:05.590,00:16:07.634,IT'S GONNA BE FINE.
00:16:23.232,00:16:26.110,Gabriel: ELENA AGUILAR...
00:16:28.321,00:16:30.239,...IN THE FLESH.
00:16:30.281,00:16:32.032,HI.
00:16:32.074,00:16:35.328,I SPENT THE LAST 20 YEARS WAITING FOR THIS DAY.
00:16:35.369,00:16:38.706,AND I GOT TO SAY...
00:16:39.624,00:16:41.751,...IT WAS WORTH IT.
00:16:43.002,00:16:46.714,YOU LOOK...GREAT.
00:16:47.924,00:16:49.509,YOU DON'T LOOK SO BAD YOURSELF.
00:16:51.552,00:16:54.555,THERE'S A LOT OF LONELY GUYS IN HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO DATE ME.
00:16:56.182,00:16:59.644,"AH, I MISSED THAT SOUND."
00:17:01.479,00:17:03.648,ME TOO.
00:17:21.958,00:17:27.254,"MR. SHAW, WE'RE HERE BECAUSE ELENA IS ON TRIAL FOR FELONY MURDER."
00:17:27.296,00:17:31.050,IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO OFFER HER DEFENSE -- PUT ME ON THE STAND.
00:17:31.091,00:17:32.719,I'LL SAY WHATEVER YOU NEED ME TO.
00:17:32.760,00:17:34.387,"GABRIEL, NO."
00:17:34.428,00:17:36.180,"LOOK, I'M ALREADY STUCK IN THIS HELLHOLE."
00:17:36.222,00:17:38.140,"THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU TO BE, TOO."
00:17:38.182,00:17:40.768,THE BOMB WAS ALL MY IDEA.
00:17:40.810,00:17:43.730,ELENA DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
00:17:45.732,00:17:47.608,THAT WORK?
00:18:04.751,00:18:06.377,I'M SORRY.
00:18:06.419,00:18:09.630,I SHOULD NOT BE HAPPY RIGHT NOW.
00:18:09.672,00:18:10.715,WE DID A TERRIBLE THING.
00:18:10.757,00:18:12.759,THAT POOR MAN DIED.
00:18:12.800,00:18:16.679,"WE SHOULD ALL PAY FOR THAT, BUT WE BELIEVED IN SOMETHING."
00:18:16.721,00:18:19.390,"I FORGOT HOW THAT FEELS, THE THRILL OF IT ALL."
00:18:19.432,00:18:22.727,THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IN THAT PARK WITH THAT MAN.
00:18:22.769,00:18:27.273,"BUT IT'S HIM. HE'S THAT FEELING, AND I MISS IT EVERY DAY."
00:18:27.314,00:18:35.698,"PLAYING DRESS-UP WITH MY GIRLS, HAVING DRINKS WITH FRIENDS, DURING SEX WITH KEVIN, I'M NEVER NOT MISSING HIM."
00:18:42.162,00:18:44.832,PLEASE DON'T TELL KEVIN THAT I SAID THAT.
00:19:02.141,00:19:04.268,"Woman: ANNALISE, THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED?"
00:19:04.310,00:19:06.980,YOU JUST WALKED OUT ON PRESIDENT DOLAN?
00:19:07.021,00:19:10.608,AND LEFT THE FATE OF OUR STAR QUARTERBACK HANGING IN THE BALANCE?
00:19:10.650,00:19:11.943,"WELL, I MEET WITH THE BOY TOMORROW."
00:19:11.985,00:19:13.444,WE'LL SEE WHAT HE SAYS.
00:19:13.486,00:19:15.071,"WELL, IT'S A BIG CASE."
00:19:15.113,00:19:16.781,THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF PRESS.
00:19:16.823,00:19:18.616,YOU WANT TO BE SURE BEFORE YOU TAKE IT.
00:19:18.658,00:19:21.410,DOES THAT MEAN YOU DON'T THINK I SHOULD TAKE IT?
00:19:26.082,00:19:31.211,"AFTER 20 YEARS, I KNOW BETTER THAN TO GIVE YOU CAREER ADVICE."
00:19:31.253,00:19:34.674,"WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YALE, SAM?"
00:19:34.715,00:19:36.467,HEARD ANYTHING BACK?
00:19:36.509,00:19:38.970,"ACTUALLY, I GOT A PHONE CALL THIS AFTERNOON."
00:19:40.220,00:19:42.473,THEY WENT WITH SOMEONE FROM DUKE.
00:19:44.017,00:19:46.019,SCREW 'EM.
00:19:46.060,00:19:50.023,"EXACTLY. I, FOR ONE, AM RELIEVED WE GET TO KEEP OUR FRIENDS."
00:20:22.304,00:20:26.851,"HE HAD BUSINESS AT YALE, CHECKED INTO YOUR HOTEL A FEW WEEKS BACK."
00:20:26.893,00:20:29.687,I JUST NEED TO FIND OUT IF THE CAR WAS PARKED HERE EVERY NIGHT HE WAS IN TOWN.
00:20:29.729,00:20:32.439,BUT YOU'RE NOT A COP.
00:20:39.405,00:20:42.241,WHAT'S THE NAME?
00:20:42.282,00:20:44.243,HERE WE ARE.
00:20:44.284,00:20:47.705,HIS CAR WAS IN THE LOT EVERY NIGHT...EXCEPT HERE.
00:20:47.747,00:20:49.540,"FRIDAY, THE 29th."
00:20:49.582,00:20:54.087,"LEFT THE GARAGE AT 7:00 P.M., WASN'T BACK TILL 6:00 THE NEXT MORNING."
00:21:00.342,00:21:01.802,CLEAN UP YOUR MESSES.
00:21:01.844,00:21:03.846,WHAT'S GOING ON?
00:21:07.141,00:21:08.684,THEY'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.
00:21:08.726,00:21:10.269,PLEASE TELL ME IT'S THE FOOTBALL PLAYER.
00:21:10.310,00:21:12.897,I HEARD A RUMOR THAT THE UNIVERSITY WANTS ANNALISE TO DEFEND HIM.
00:21:12.939,00:21:14.190,DON'T CALL HER ANNALISE.
00:21:14.232,00:21:15.315,YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.
00:21:17.317,00:21:21.239,Griffin: THERE WAS A PARTY AT MY FRATERNITY THAT FRIDAY.
00:21:21.280,00:21:23.490,LILA DIDN'T COME.
00:21:23.532,00:21:27.369,"SHE WAS PISSED AT ME, AND I JUST WANTED A BREAK."
00:21:27.411,00:21:32.708,"WE WERE DRINKING A LOT, AND SOME OF THE GIRLS WANTED COKE, SO I CALLED REBECCA."
00:21:32.750,00:21:34.627,Annalise: SHE WAS YOUR DEALER?
00:21:34.668,00:21:37.296,"NO, SHE WAS FRIENDS WITH LILA."
00:21:37.337,00:21:39.090,LILA WAS FRIENDS WITH A DRUG DEALER?
00:21:39.132,00:21:40.382,SHE KNEW ALL TYPES OF PEOPLE.
00:21:40.424,00:21:42.426,REBECCA CAME OVER.
00:21:42.468,00:21:44.178,WE GOT REALLY MESSED UP.
00:21:44.220,00:21:52.979,"NEXT THING I KNOW, I'M BACK IN MY ROOM WITH HER, OUR CLOTHES ARE OFF, AND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE -- WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE WHEN LILA WALKED IN."
00:21:53.020,00:21:56.816,"WE NEVER DID THAT, LILA AND ME."
00:21:56.857,00:22:00.778,"WE'D TAKEN A VOW, PROMISED EACH OTHER WE'D WAIT TILL WE GOT MARRIED."
00:22:00.820,00:22:02.321,LILA JUST LOST IT.
00:22:02.362,00:22:04.531,"I MEAN, SHE'S SCREAMING, SCRATCHING ME."
00:22:04.573,00:22:07.827,THAT'S WHY MY DNA IS UNDER HER NAILS.
00:22:07.868,00:22:13.332,"SHE RAN OUT, AND THAT'S WHEN I SEE REBECCA...SMILING."
00:22:13.373,00:22:16.669,I KNEW THEN SHE SET THE WHOLE THING UP.
00:22:16.710,00:22:21.381,"SHE TEXTED LILA FROM MY PHONE WHEN WE WERE HOOKING UP, AND SHE TOLD HER THAT I NEEDED TO SEE HER."
00:22:21.423,00:22:24.593,I LOOKED FOR LILA ALL NIGHT.
00:22:24.635,00:22:27.847,"I CALLED HER FRIENDS, I WENT TO HER ROOM."
00:22:27.888,00:22:32.226,I WAS PROBABLY THERE WHEN SHE WAS GETTING STRANGLED ON THAT ROOF.
00:22:32.268,00:22:36.689,REBECCA DID THIS...NOT ME.
00:22:38.356,00:22:40.609,I SWEAR TO GOD.
00:23:25.529,00:23:27.031,SIGN IN.
00:23:48.886,00:23:50.596,WHAT IS THIS?
00:23:50.637,00:23:53.974,"REBECCA, I'M FROM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE."
00:24:03.276,00:24:05.236,THANK YOU.
00:24:11.491,00:24:12.910,TELL ME YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY MY LAWYER.
00:24:12.952,00:24:14.828,I FOUND THE PHONE.
00:24:16.163,00:24:18.040,LILA'S PHONE.
00:24:23.754,00:24:28.259,"There's evidence on the phone, right, something that can prove you're innocent?"
00:24:28.301,00:24:30.219,"Otherwise, why would you keep it?"
00:24:32.846,00:24:34.807,You have to trust me here.
00:24:34.848,00:24:40.104,"THEY'RE GONNA ASSIGN YOU SOME LAME PUBLIC DEFENDER, AND RIGHT NOW, YOUR CASE FEELS REALLY HARD TO WIN."
00:24:40.146,00:24:44.817,"I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET YOU OTHER HELP, BUT FIRST YOU HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT'S ON THE PHONE."
00:24:47.778,00:24:48.821,GUARD!
00:24:48.862,00:24:50.239,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:24:51.489,00:24:53.284,GUARD!
00:24:53.326,00:24:54.785,"HE'S NOT MY LAWYER, HE'S A LAW STUDENT. HE LIED."
00:24:54.827,00:24:56.703,YOU NEED MY HELP!
00:24:56.745,00:24:58.289,LET'S GO. LET'S GO.
00:24:58.331,00:24:59.790,LET'S GO.
00:24:58.331,00:25:01.541,THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE -- BECAUSE HE'S GONNA PIN IT ON YOU!
00:25:07.340,00:25:09.342,DO YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE?
00:25:09.383,00:25:11.802,SEE THE PILE?
00:25:11.844,00:25:14.388,"ACTUALLY, CAN I HELP WITH THAT TOMORROW?"
00:25:14.430,00:25:19.268,"THERE'S THIS LAW-REVIEW PARTY TONIGHT, AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO -- Frank: WHERE'S IT AT?"
00:25:19.310,00:25:20.602,A...BAR.
00:25:20.644,00:25:22.980,I THINK IT'S CALLED McKOY'S.
00:25:23.022,00:25:28.526,"YOU GUYS CAN COME IF -- WE'RE NOT GOING, AND IF YOU WANTED TO GO, YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID SO FROM THE START."
00:25:28.568,00:25:30.154,JUST 'CAUSE WE GOT NO LIVES DOESN'T MEAN NO ONE ELSE CAN.
00:25:30.196,00:25:32.156,LET HER GO.
00:25:35.034,00:25:36.869,YOU HEARD HIM.
00:25:40.289,00:25:41.874,Man: WHY APPLY TO LAW REVIEW?
00:25:41.915,00:25:43.959,YOU'RE ALREADY PUTTING IN 80-HOUR WEEKS.
00:25:44.001,00:25:45.836,IT'D BE CRAZY TO TAKE ON MORE.
00:25:45.878,00:25:49.589,"TO THE FOLKS WHO THINK THAT WAY, I JUST WANT TO SAY -- GROW A PAIR!"
00:25:49.631,00:25:51.425,DO YOU NOT WANT MULTIPLE JOB OFFERS?
00:25:51.467,00:25:53.260,DO YOU NOT WANT TO BE PRESIDENT SOMEDAY?
00:25:53.302,00:25:55.762,"HELL, YEAH! YES!"
00:25:55.804,00:25:57.639,YOU HAVE A GUN ON YOU?
00:25:57.681,00:26:00.809,I'D JUST GIVE ANYTHING TO PUT THIS GUY OUT OF HIS MISERY.
00:26:00.851,00:26:02.602,"I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG."
00:26:00.851,00:26:05.064,I'M ALL FOR GUN CONTROL -- EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO D-BAGS.
00:26:05.105,00:26:07.274,"CAN I GET A HELL, YEAH?"
00:26:07.316,00:26:09.235,THERE SEEM TO BE A LOT OF THOSE AROUND HERE.
00:26:09.276,00:26:11.028,"WELL, WELCOME TO LAW REVIEW."
00:26:11.070,00:26:12.321,I'M KAN.
00:26:12.363,00:26:13.989,LAUREL.
00:26:14.031,00:26:17.368,AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY SELLING ME ON APPLYING IF THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS PARTY.
00:26:17.410,00:26:18.869,"NO, I DON'T DO LAW REVIEW."
00:26:23.623,00:26:25.292,AND TO MEET SMART GIRLS.
00:26:25.334,00:26:27.669,Connor: JED FREEMAN JOINED THE ARMY?
00:26:27.711,00:26:31.173,"YEAH, HE'S LIKE A -- A CORPORATE LIEUTENANT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT."
00:26:31.215,00:26:32.841,IT'S CRAZY.
00:26:32.883,00:26:35.177,"UH, CONNOR, DO YOU MIND GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE?"
00:26:35.219,00:26:37.096,THIS IS OUR LAST NIGHT TOGETHER.
00:26:37.137,00:26:38.596,MY BAD.
00:26:38.638,00:26:40.640,CONGRATS AGAIN ON THE ENGAGEMENT.
00:26:40.682,00:26:45.438,"YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE I'D BE THE ONE WEARING AIDEN'S RING."
00:26:45.479,00:26:47.856,"OH, MY GOD."
00:26:48.690,00:26:51.693,"WAIT, YOU -- YOU NEVER TOLD HER?"
00:26:51.735,00:26:53.237,"COME ON, DUDE."
00:26:53.279,00:26:54.905,IT'S NOTHING.
00:26:54.947,00:26:56.823,AIDEN -- RELAX. RELAX.
00:26:56.865,00:27:02.829,"WE WERE 16, LOCKED AWAY AT AN ALL-BOYS BOARDING SCHOOL IN THE MIDDLE OF FREEZING NEW HAMPSHIRE."
00:27:02.871,00:27:04.582,IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
00:27:06.875,00:27:08.461,"SHOTS ON ME, PARTY PEOPLE!"
00:27:08.502,00:27:10.087,"OH, HO, YEAH!"
00:27:28.021,00:27:29.856,"HEY, FRANK!"
00:27:29.898,00:27:31.858,"HEY, COME DO A BUTTERY NIPPLE!"
00:27:31.900,00:27:33.569,YOU LIED.
00:27:33.611,00:27:35.571,IT WAS YEARS AGO.
00:27:35.613,00:27:37.573,"OH, STOP!"
00:27:35.613,00:27:39.533,I DON'T WANT ANY MORE OF A MENTAL PICTURE THAN I ALREADY HAVE!
00:27:39.575,00:27:41.201,"LOOK, OKAY, I-I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT? I KNOW."
00:27:41.243,00:27:43.621,BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN LYING TO YOU.
00:27:43.661,00:27:48.959,"BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL OUR EXES, AND YOU'VE NEVER MENTIONED A BOY, WHICH FEELS A LOT LIKE LYING!"
00:27:49.001,00:27:50.419,YOU KNOW ME.
00:27:50.461,00:27:51.920,I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
00:27:53.464,00:27:55.341,"ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?"
00:27:55.382,00:27:58.385,I'M JUST GONNA GET THE TRAIN BACK TONIGHT.
00:27:58.427,00:28:01.472,I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
00:28:11.440,00:28:12.566,RIGHT IN THERE.
00:28:17.613,00:28:19.448,SHE'S MY NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR.
00:28:19.490,00:28:23.494,"YOUR NEIGHBOR WAS THE OTHER SUSPECT IN THIS CASE, AND YOU DIDN'T THINK TO TELL ME?!"
00:28:23.536,00:28:25.204,I DON'T REALLY KNOW HER.
00:28:23.536,00:28:27.540,"WE JUST LIVE NEXT DOOR, AND I -- WHAT?!"
00:28:28.832,00:28:31.293,YOU CAN'T DEFEND GRIFFIN!
00:28:31.335,00:28:32.878,I SAW HIM FIGHTING WITH REBECCA.
00:28:32.919,00:28:34.630,HE'S NOT A GOOD GUY LIKE YOU THINK.
00:28:34.672,00:28:39.593,"AND HE'S GOT EVERYTHING -- THE SCHOOL, MONEY -- BUT REBECCA'S GOT NOTHING."
00:28:39.635,00:28:41.512,"SHE'S ALONE, A -- A PAWN."
00:28:41.554,00:28:46.766,AND ISN'T THAT WHY YOU DO THIS -- DEFEND PEOPLE -- SO THEY GET A FAIR TRIAL?
00:28:46.808,00:28:48.977,BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN FOR HER BECAUSE SHE'S POOR.
00:28:49.019,00:28:52.690,"AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR OR RIGHT, AND..."
00:28:52.772,00:28:55.442,"IF YOU WANT TO FIRE ME, FINE."
00:28:55.484,00:28:58.153,BUT SHE NEEDS YOU.
00:29:00.364,00:29:03.659,I DON'T KNOW.
00:29:03.701,00:29:08.414,I JUST WANTED TO DO...
00:29:12.710,00:29:14.461,I'M DONE.
00:29:16.838,00:29:19.799,WE HAVE AN ACTUAL CLIENT WAITING FOR US IN COURT.
00:29:21.510,00:29:22.969,LET'S GO.
00:29:32.104,00:29:36.108,"I HOOKED UP WITH PRETTY MUCH ALL THE HOT GUYS AT BOARDING SCHOOL, IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER."
00:29:36.149,00:29:38.527,"ALSO, I BARELY REMEMBER WHAT HIS PENIS LOOKS LIKE."
00:29:38.569,00:29:41.697,WAIT. NO.
00:29:41.739,00:29:43.782,I STILL DO.
00:29:43.823,00:29:48.370,"LOOKED LIKE, UH, YOU AND THAT LEGAL-AID GUY WERE...BONDING PRETTY WELL LAST NIGHT."
00:29:48.412,00:29:51.831,"OH, YEAH."
00:29:51.873,00:29:55.628,"In fact, I think Frank was so grossed out, he had to leave."
00:29:55.669,00:29:57.963,FRANK WAS THERE?
00:30:06.221,00:30:11.059,"DUDE, LOOKS LIKE YOU FOUND AN EVEN BETTER PARTY THAN WE DID LAST NIGHT, HUH?"
00:30:13.395,00:30:18.233,"MR. BORDAL, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL WITNESS."
00:30:18.275,00:30:21.361,"YES, YOUR HONOR. THE PROSECUTION CALLS GABRIEL SHAW."
00:30:21.403,00:30:23.656,WHAT?!
00:30:23.697,00:30:26.074,"ONCE HE'S ON THE WITNESS LIST, EITHER SIDE CAN CALL HIM."
00:30:40.422,00:30:43.383,"TAKE US BACK TO 1994, MR. SHAW."
00:30:43.425,00:30:50.432,"HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THAT TIME AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, AS IT RELATES TO ELENA AGUILAR, A.K.A., PAULA MURPHY?"
00:30:50.474,00:30:56.563,"WE WERE FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT, DOING ALL WE COULD TO REVERSE THE RAMPANT GREED AROUND US."
00:30:56.605,00:31:03.195,I GUESS THAT'S WHY I WASN'T THAT SURPRISED WHEN ELENA SUGGESTED THAT...
00:31:03.236,00:31:05.155,WE PLANT THAT BOMB.
00:31:15.957,00:31:23.131,"MR. SHAW, DIDN'T YOU TELL ME BEFORE THE TRIAL THAT IT WAS YOUR IDEA TO PLANT THE BOMB, NOT MY CLIENT'S?"
00:31:23.173,00:31:25.467,DID I?
00:31:25.509,00:31:31.014,"LOOK, ELENA IS THE WOMAN I'VE LOVED MY ENTIRE LIFE -- EVEN ALL THIS TIME IN JAIL."
00:31:31.056,00:31:33.266,"SO, WHEN I SAW HER THE OTHER DAY..."
00:31:35.728,00:31:37.855,"...WELL, I WOULD HAVE SAID ANYTHING TO PROTECT HER."
00:31:42.609,00:31:47.280,BUT THEN I CAME TO MY SENSES AND DECIDED TO TELL THE TRUTH.
00:31:47.322,00:31:50.909,THE TRUTH. EXACTLY.
00:31:50.950,00:31:55.914,AND THE TRUTH IS YOU WERE NOT ON THE PROSECUTION'S ORIGINAL WITNESS LIST.
00:31:55.955,00:31:57.165,ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
00:31:57.207,00:31:58.876,IT IS.
00:31:58.917,00:32:03.422,"SO, IT WASN'T UNTIL YOU SPOKE WITH THE DEFENSE THAT THE U.S. ATTORNEY CONVINCED YOU TO SWAP SIDES?"
00:32:03.463,00:32:06.383,OBJECTION. THE WORD CONVINCE IMPLIES THAT -- I'LL REPHRASE IT.
00:32:06.425,00:32:09.762,WHAT DEAL WAS PROMISED TO YOU IF YOU AGREED TO TESTIFY AGAINST MY CLIENT?
00:32:09.803,00:32:11.555,OBJECTION.
00:32:11.597,00:32:13.724,"REALLY? SO, THERE WAS NO OFFER ON THE TABLE?"
00:32:13.766,00:32:15.225,HE SIMPLY VOLUNTEERED?
00:32:15.267,00:32:17.018,"Judge: ANSWER THE QUESTION, MR. SHAW."
00:32:23.817,00:32:25.736,EARLY RELEASE.
00:32:27.404,00:32:29.448,EARLY RELEASE.
00:32:31.241,00:32:33.118,WOW.
00:32:33.159,00:32:36.580,"SO, AFTER 20 YEARS IN PRISON, YOU GET TO WALK FREE."
00:32:36.622,00:32:38.457,THAT MUST FEEL AMAZING.
00:32:38.498,00:32:43.462,"AFTER 20 YEARS IN A CELL, I THINK I'D SAY PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING FOR THAT."
00:32:43.503,00:32:45.547,YOUR HONOR -- NOTHING FURTHER.
00:32:54.055,00:32:56.266,Kevin: YOU JUST KEEP LYING TO ME.
00:32:56.308,00:32:57.893,Paula: I'M SORRY.
00:32:57.935,00:33:02.272,I DON'T KNOW IF Y-Y-YOU'RE UPSET RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GO TO JAIL OR BECAUSE YOUR CREEPY LOVER JUST BETRAYED YOU.
00:33:03.565,00:33:07.026,KEVIN!
00:33:07.068,00:33:08.904,THE JUDGE HAS GIVEN US THREE HOURS.
00:33:08.946,00:33:10.656,THAT'S HOW LONG WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR DEFENSE.
00:33:10.697,00:33:13.700,"LOOK INTO FORENSICS, CRIME TECH, THE FBI LAB."
00:33:13.742,00:33:16.912,"THIS MOMENT, RIGHT NOW -- THIS IS WHEN YOU PROVE YOUR WORTH."
00:33:19.998,00:33:21.667,"YOU WORKED ON THE GABRIEL SHAW CASE, RIGHT?"
00:33:21.708,00:33:23.001,WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?
00:33:23.042,00:33:25.838,JUST WRITING A RESEARCH PAPER FOR MY CRIMINOLOGY CLASS AT MIDDLETON.
00:33:25.879,00:33:29.257,"WELL, I'M AFRAID THAT -- THE FILES FOR THIS ONE CASE."
00:33:29.299,00:33:31.259,IT'S NEARLY ALL PUBLIC INFORMATION.
00:33:31.301,00:33:34.680,"LOOK, FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME SAVES MY LIFE."
00:33:34.721,00:33:36.306,PLEASE.
00:33:49.945,00:33:51.363,"OH, MY GOD."
00:33:51.404,00:33:54.783,"YES, I'M LOOKING FOR NED CRAWFORD AT THE ALLENTOWN PRISON."
00:33:59.371,00:34:01.164,MR. CRAWFORD?
00:34:01.206,00:34:03.792,"HI. YOU DON'T KNOW ME, BUT MY NAME IS MICHAELA PRATT."
00:34:03.834,00:34:05.627,Asher: YOU FOUND SOMETHING?
00:34:05.669,00:34:11.299,"I GOT AHOLD OF THE PRISON LOGS FOR GABRIEL SHAW, AND HE RECEIVED SIX PHONE CALLS FROM A WOMAN NAMED JANE SANTORA EVER SINCE WE TOOK PAULA TO VISIT HIM IN PRISON."
00:34:11.341,00:34:13.927,SANTORA IS PAULA'S MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME.
00:34:13.969,00:34:15.595,WHY WOULD SHE BE CALLING HIM?
00:34:15.637,00:34:16.763,PROFESSOR KEATING.
00:34:16.805,00:34:18.431,WHERE? NO.
00:34:18.473,00:34:22.143,"SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT I FOUND OUT THAT -- THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER, FRANK."
00:34:24.396,00:34:29.735,"Kevin: WE WERE IN THE CAFETERIA, TALKING -- I THOUGHT WE WERE WORKING THROUGH IT -- WHEN SHE SAID SHE NEEDED TO GO TO THE RESTROOM."
00:34:29.776,00:34:32.111,THAT WAS AN HOUR AGO.
00:34:32.153,00:34:36.366,"Judge: MS. KEATING, HAVE YOU LOCATED YOUR CLIENT?"
00:34:40.996,00:34:44.290,"I'M AFRAID HER WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN, YOUR HONOR."
00:34:45.375,00:34:46.835,VERY WELL.
00:34:46.877,00:34:50.129,I'M ISSUING A BENCH WARRANT FOR THE IMMEDIATE ARREST OF PAULA MURPHY...
00:34:50.171,00:34:52.716,...A.K.A. ELENA AGUILAR.
00:34:52.758,00:34:58.764,"UNTIL SHE'S DETAINED, CASE H9Y2 IS PUT ON PERMANENT HOLD."
00:34:58.805,00:35:01.099,COURT ADJOURNED.
00:35:20.077,00:35:24.497,"CHOOSE YOUR HUSBAND CAREFULLY, MISS PRATT."
00:35:24.539,00:35:27.751,YOU'LL ONLY HAVE YOURSELF TO BLAME IF IT ENDS BADLY.
00:35:50.440,00:35:51.984,HI.
00:36:11.837,00:36:13.421,THERE'S NOTHING?
00:36:13.463,00:36:15.966,NOTHING.
00:36:16.008,00:36:18.468,"I CHECKED WITH YALE, THE HOTEL."
00:36:18.510,00:36:20.637,HE WAS THERE THE NIGHT SHE WAS MURDERED.
00:36:20.679,00:36:21.972,DR. KEATING DIDN'T SHOW.
00:36:22.014,00:36:24.808,"LEFT THE GARAGE AT 7:00 P.M., WASN'T BACK TILL 6:00 THE NEXT MORNING."
00:36:24.850,00:36:26.768,HIS ALIBI'S SOLID.
00:36:26.810,00:36:28.561,YOU'RE SURE?
00:36:30.939,00:36:32.065,"HE NEVER LEFT, ANNALISE."
00:36:32.107,00:36:34.067,"OH, THANK GOD."
00:36:39.531,00:36:41.616,GOOD NIGHT.
00:36:41.658,00:36:43.284,WAIT.
00:36:50.083,00:36:52.502,I'VE MISSED YOU.
00:37:13.356,00:37:15.400,BE WITH YOUR HUSBAND.
00:37:39.883,00:37:42.343,HERE.
00:37:45.722,00:37:47.640,THAT'S THE LAST ONE.
00:37:47.682,00:37:50.185,"EVERYONE, GET IN THE CAR."
00:37:58.777,00:38:00.112,WAIT.
00:38:00.153,00:38:01.988,Wait. Wait. Wait.
00:38:02.030,00:38:03.823,"JUST...GET IN THE CAR, MICHAELA."
00:38:03.865,00:38:05.408,"OH, NO, M-M-M-M-MY RING."
00:38:05.450,00:38:06.785,WHAT?
00:38:06.826,00:38:09.037,MY ENGAGEMENT RING IS GONE!
00:38:12.082,00:38:14.459,I LOST IT.
00:38:14.500,00:38:16.044,I LOST MY RING.
00:38:16.086,00:38:17.879,I LOST MY RING.
00:38:17.921,00:38:20.006,I LOST MY RING.
00:38:20.048,00:38:21.133,I LOST MY RING.
00:38:21.174,00:38:23.009,I LOST MY RING.
00:38:32.727,00:38:34.062,HEY.
00:38:34.104,00:38:35.521,WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!
00:38:35.563,00:38:36.940,YOU WOULDN'T RETURN MY CALLS.
00:38:36.982,00:38:40.568,"YOU CAN'T JUST SHOW UP, NOT WHEN THERE ARE MURDERERS EVERYWHERE!"
00:38:40.610,00:38:42.988,"YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT."
00:38:43.029,00:38:45.490,ABOUT EVERYTHING.
00:38:45.531,00:38:47.159,I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THE MINUTE WE RAN INTO WALSH.
00:38:47.200,00:38:51.204,"YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME BEFORE YOU PROPOSED, BEFORE YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME, BEFORE YOU ASKED ME OUT."
00:38:51.246,00:38:53.832,"MICHAELA, COME ON -- WERE THERE OTHERS?"
00:38:53.873,00:38:54.916,"WHAT, PEOPLE I HOOKED UP WITH?"
00:38:54.958,00:38:56.084,MEN.
00:38:56.126,00:38:57.376,MEN YOU HAD SEX WITH.
00:38:57.418,00:38:58.795,NO.
00:38:58.837,00:39:00.255,BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GAY -- I'M NOT GAY.
00:39:00.297,00:39:02.381,IF YOU ARE GAY -- I'M NOT GAY!
00:39:02.423,00:39:04.259,PEOPLE ARE GAY. MY COUSIN IS GAY. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
00:39:04.301,00:39:06.219,"I'LL STILL BE YOUR FRIEND, BUT I JUST -- MICHAELA!"
00:39:06.261,00:39:10.515,"IT WAS A STUPID THING THAT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS A KID, A HORNY KID."
00:39:10.556,00:39:12.934,I'M NOT SOME GUY ON THE DOWN LOW.
00:39:12.976,00:39:14.477,YOU KNOW THAT.
00:39:16.104,00:39:19.398,I LOVE YOU.
00:39:19.440,00:39:21.901,I'M NOT GAY.
00:39:25.030,00:39:27.699,MY WEDDING DRESS IS VERA WANG...
00:39:27.740,00:39:32.287,NOT OFF-THE-RACK VERA WANG -- BESPOKE VERA WANG.
00:39:32.329,00:39:34.831,IT COST ME A FORTUNE.
00:39:37.292,00:39:40.837,"SO, YOU BETTER BE SURE."
00:39:43.340,00:39:45.717,"YOU CAN'T EMBARRASS ME, AIDEN."
00:39:45.758,00:39:50.222,"I HAVE A PLAN FOR MY LIFE, AND IT DOESN'T INCLUDE YOU RUINING US."
00:39:50.263,00:39:51.556,YOU HEAR ME?
00:39:51.597,00:40:01.649,"SO YOU'D BETTER BE SURE BECAUSE IF YOU EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT AGAIN, I WILL DIVORCE YOU, AND I WILL TAKE ALL YOUR MONEY, AND I WILL DESTROY ANY CHANCE YOU HAVE AT A POLITICAL CAREER."
00:40:07.197,00:40:10.158,I'M SORRY.
00:40:10.200,00:40:12.660,I'M SO SORRY.
00:40:23.504,00:40:25.340,Annalise: I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE.
00:40:25.382,00:40:29.094,I JUST NEEDED SOME TIME TO ENSURE I COULD BE FULLY COMMITTED TO THE CASE.
00:40:29.135,00:40:31.388,"SO, YOU'VE COME TO A DECISION?"
00:40:31.429,00:40:33.723,I HAVE.
00:40:36.434,00:40:37.769,Sam: CAUGHT YA!
00:40:37.810,00:40:39.187,SORRY.
00:40:39.229,00:40:42.815,JUST A LITTLE SNACK.
00:40:42.857,00:40:45.735,YOU GUYS COME TO A DECISION YET ON THAT FOOTBALL PLAYER?
00:40:45.777,00:40:47.404,SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?
00:40:50.656,00:40:54.493,Annalise: I'D LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THE NEW OWNER OF THE TROPHY...
00:40:54.535,00:40:59.082,SOMEONE WHO HAS IMPRESSED ME GREATLY THIS WEEK...

00:03:23.495,00:03:25.204,WHO SAYS IT'S MY ASS?
00:03:25.204,00:03:28.876,"Annalise: HOW ARE WE TO KNOW WHETHER THE CONFESSION WAS COERCED OR NOT, YOUR HONOR?"
00:03:28.876,00:03:31.461,MS. PARKS HAS NOT SUPPLIED THE DEFENSE WITH THE VIDEO.
00:03:31.461,00:03:33.296,Wendy: BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN PLACED INTO EVIDENCE.
00:03:33.296,00:03:37.676,"AS SUCH, I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THE CONFESSION NOT BE CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE BAIL AMOUNT."
00:03:37.676,00:03:43.932,"MS. SUTTER'S WRITTEN CONFESSION IS IN EVIDENCE, IN WHICH SHE ADMITS TO THIS ESPECIALLY HEINOUS CRIME."
00:03:43.932,00:03:46.185,I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD SET BAIL AT THE MAXIMUM.
00:03:46.185,00:03:50.856,"YOUR HONOR, MY CLIENT IS A PERSON OF SLIM MEANS -- YOUR CLIENT SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THAT WHEN SHE CONFESSED TO MURDER."
00:03:50.856,00:03:52.941,I'M SETTING BAIL AT $1 MILLION.
00:03:55.777,00:03:58.113,THAT'S A LOT OF LAP DANCES.
00:03:58.113,00:04:00.782,"SHE'S A BARTENDER, NOT A STRIPPER."
00:04:03.160,00:04:05.996,"REBECCA, TELL ME THE CODE TO THE PHONE."
00:04:11.085,00:04:15.672,Bonnie: THIS IS NORMAL -- THE JUDGE ALWAYS SETS A SUBSTANTIAL BAIL ON HIGH-PROFILE CASES.
00:04:15.672,00:04:20.468,WHAT WILL HELP US APPEAL THE AMOUNT IS IF WE KNOW THE DETAILS THAT LED TO YOUR CONFESSION.
00:04:20.468,00:04:24.848,THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO TELL US EVERY DETAIL SINCE YOUR ARREST.
00:04:24.848,00:04:28.518,CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH IT?
00:04:28.518,00:04:30.687,REBECCA?
00:04:30.687,00:04:40.781,THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT -- FOR YOU TO CURL INTO SOME DARK PLACE IN YOUR MIND AND STAY SILENT WHILE THEY DEFINE WHO YOU ARE.
00:04:40.781,00:04:45.535,"TRASHY, DRUG-DEALING TOWNIE."
00:04:45.535,00:04:47.955,BUT YOU CAN BE HEARD.
00:04:47.955,00:04:51.166,AND IT STARTS RIGHT HERE WITH US.
00:04:54.544,00:04:57.338,I DIDN'T DO IT.
00:04:58.381,00:04:59.674,I DIDN'T KILL HER.
00:04:59.674,00:05:03.720,YOU CONFESSED THAT YOU DID.
00:05:03.720,00:05:05.264,THEY MADE ME SAY THOSE THINGS.
00:05:05.264,00:05:07.390,I-I JUST WANTED THEM TO STOP.
00:05:07.390,00:05:09.517,I WANTED TO GO HOME.
00:05:09.517,00:05:14.564,"BUT THEY SAID THAT I COULDN'T, THAT GRIFFIN ALREADY TOLD THEM EVERYTHING."
00:05:14.564,00:05:16.275,WES WAS RIGHT.
00:05:16.275,00:05:19.653,WES?
00:05:19.653,00:05:21.321,HE WAS RIGHT.
00:05:28.411,00:05:33.959,IT'S YOUR BIG MOUTH THAT MOTIVATED OUR CLIENT INTO A CONFESSION.
00:05:33.959,00:05:38.379,BUT ALL I DID WAS TELL -- YOUR BEHAVIOR IS STARTING TO MAKE ME QUESTION WHETHER YOU'RE WORKING FOR THE OTHER SIDE.
00:05:38.379,00:05:43.177,"YOU BETTER TELL ME, IN DETAIL, EVERYTHING YOU EVER SAID TO HER."
00:05:43.177,00:05:45.595,I -- THAT'S ALL I SAID.
00:05:45.595,00:05:46.638,NOTHING ELSE?
00:05:49.266,00:05:51.185,HELLO?
00:05:51.185,00:05:53.061,YOU HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT'S ON THE PHONE.
00:05:53.061,00:05:54.562,NO.
00:05:56.564,00:05:58.942,"OH, IT LOOKS LIKE THE TROPHY'S GONNA BE IN PLAY."
00:05:58.942,00:06:01.486,HE ADVOCATED FOR HIS CLIENT.
00:06:01.486,00:06:03.446,YOU EVER THROW UP IN YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU SAY STUFF LIKE THAT?
00:06:03.446,00:06:05.991,Michaela: IS THAT A TILLMAN OUTLINE?

00:06:08.952,00:06:11.121,HIS OUTLINES ARE THE HOLY GRAIL.

00:06:12.998,00:06:14.415,"OH, YOUR BOYFRIEND'S GIVING YOU HIS OUTLINES NOW?"
00:06:14.415,00:06:15.458,WHAT'S NEXT? HERPES?
00:06:15.458,00:06:17.169,HOW ABOUT WE TRADE?
00:06:17.169,00:06:19.171,I'LL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING FROM MY PROPERTY STUDY GROUP.
00:06:19.171,00:06:23.008,NO.
00:06:25.344,00:06:27.095,FINE.
00:06:27.095,00:06:29.306,SOUNDS LIKE IT'S SHOOTING-STAR TIME.
00:06:32.017,00:06:33.727,HAIR GEL'S GOT ICE IN HIS VEINS.

00:06:39.398,00:06:41.026,WHAT THE HELL'S A SHOOTING STAR?
00:06:43.195,00:06:48.449,"WE NEED A COPY OF REBECCA'S CONFESSION TAPE AND DETAINMENT LOGS, OTHERWISE THERE'S NO GETTING HER OUT ON BAIL."
00:06:48.449,00:06:49.701,BE CREATIVE.
00:06:49.701,00:06:51.494,"SHE TOOK AWAY THE TROPHY, RIGHT?"
00:06:51.494,00:06:53.747,MR. GIBBINS IS OFF THE REBECCA SUTTER CASE.
00:06:53.747,00:06:59.418,YOU DO NOT SPEAK OR EVEN LOOK AT HER UNLESS I SPECIFICALLY ASK YOU.

00:07:21.400,00:07:23.777,"MAYBE SHE CAN SELL ONE, PAY REBECCA'S BAIL."
00:07:23.777,00:07:28.323,"OUR CLIENT CAME FROM NOTHING, PUT HERSELF THROUGH SCHOOL BY CLEANING OFFICES."
00:07:28.323,00:07:33.870,"STARTED TRADING OUT OF HER APARTMENT, CLAWING HER WAY TO THE TOP OF A FIELD NOTORIOUSLY DOMINATED BY MEN."
00:07:33.870,00:07:36.706,I NEED YOU TO TAKE THIS CASE SERIOUSLY.
00:07:36.706,00:07:38.750,WHAT'S THE CHARGE AGAINST HER?

00:08:15.703,00:08:22.752,YOUR CLIENT PURCHASED STOCK IN EDSON PHARMACEUTICALS IN ADVANCE OF A FAVORABLE FDA RULING ARISING FROM INSIDER KNOWLEDGE.
00:08:22.752,00:08:24.045,WAS ANY OF THAT IN ENGLISH?
00:08:24.045,00:08:28.549,Annalise: I STILL SEE NO PROOF OF MY CLIENT'S CONNECTION TO EDSON PHARMACEUTICALS.
00:08:28.549,00:08:29.926,RIGHT.

00:08:31.845,00:08:34.222,YOU WANT PROOF?
00:08:34.222,00:08:36.683,HOW ABOUT A LITTLE LIGHT VIEWING?
00:08:36.683,00:08:42.189,"NOW, MS. TRUDEAU, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO THAT MAN MAY BE?"
00:08:42.189,00:08:43.982,ELIAS EDSON.
00:08:43.982,00:08:45.608,ELIAS EDSON.
00:08:45.608,00:08:48.528,AND THAT WOULD BE THE C.E.O.

00:09:09.924,00:09:15.305,WE ALL KNOW THE ONLY REASON YOU WON'T GIVE US REBECCA SUTTER'S CONFESSION IS THAT THERE'S PROOF OF COERCION YOU DON'T WANT US TO SEE.
00:09:15.305,00:09:17.182,"OH, WOULDN'T THAT BE SO EASY FOR YOU?"
00:09:17.182,00:09:20.268,THOSE DIRTY COPS WITH THEIR DIRTY INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES.
00:09:20.268,00:09:22.645,"UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED HERE."
00:09:22.645,00:09:24.356,THEN WHY NOT HAND OVER THE TAPE?
00:09:24.356,00:09:27.192,WE WILL IF WE DECIDE TO PUT IT INTO EVIDENCE.
00:09:27.192,00:09:28.985,'CAUSE YOU PREFER TO SPRING IT ON US DURING THE TRIAL?
00:09:28.985,00:09:31.612,"YOU KNOW, ISN'T THAT THE FUN PART OF COURT? GOODBYE."
00:09:31.612,00:09:34.824,"OH, AND TELL ANNALISE TO SEND FRANK NEXT TIME."
00:09:34.824,00:09:37.744,I PREFER HIM WATCHING MY ASS WALK AWAY.

00:09:52.842,00:09:55.595,YES?
00:09:55.595,00:09:57.389,TELL HIS ASSISTANT IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
00:09:57.389,00:09:59.349,NO ONE'S JUDGING YOU FOR MAKING A SEX TAPE.
00:09:59.349,00:10:01.560,IT'S WHO YOU MADE IT WITH.
00:10:01.560,00:10:04.729,"I DIDN'T BUY THAT STOCK, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING."
00:10:04.729,00:10:07.274,HIS ASSISTANT SAID HE'S ON A PLANE TO BELGIUM.
00:10:07.274,00:10:10.026,HE'S DODGING ME.
00:10:10.026,00:10:11.778,YES. AND A HOOKER.
00:10:11.778,00:10:14.531,PURCHASES WERE MADE UNDER YOUR UNIQUE LOGIN.
00:10:16.616,00:10:18.326,"WELL, WE'LL HAVE AN I.T. EXPERT LOOK FOR EVIDENCE OF HACKING."
00:10:18.326,00:10:20.870,ANYONE YOU SUSPECT?
00:10:20.870,00:10:22.414,"NO, MY PEOPLE ARE LOYAL."
00:10:22.414,00:10:27.377,LOOK OUTSIDE OF MY FIRM.
00:10:27.377,00:10:29.337,"OH, YOU DON'T MAKE HISTORY BEING LIKED."
00:10:29.337,00:10:32.549,THAT'S THE WOMAN I KNOW AND LOVE.
00:10:32.549,00:10:36.177,"AND, ANNALISE, GET THIS THROWN OUT IN THE PRELIMINARY HEARING."
00:10:36.177,00:10:39.806,"MARREN, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE."
00:10:39.806,00:10:42.642,I'VE ALREADY LOST 10 CLIENTS.
00:10:42.642,00:10:44.478,IT'S $50 MILLION OUT THE DOOR.
00:10:44.478,00:10:46.313,FED JUST TOOK HALF MY TERMINALS.
00:10:46.313,00:10:50.233,"AND IF THIS GOES TO TRIAL, FIRM GOES UNDER."
00:10:50.233,00:10:56.573,"THAT CANNOT HAPPEN, NOT BECAUSE OF SOME BASTARD SPREADING LIES."
00:10:56.573,00:10:59.534,I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
00:10:59.534,00:11:01.328,THANK YOU.
00:11:01.328,00:11:05.540,PRELIMINARY HEARINGS ARE WON BY THE PROSECUTION 99% OF THE TIME.
00:11:05.540,00:11:15.175,"THE JUDGE ONLY NEEDS TO PROVE THAT THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE OF A CRIME TO GO TO TRIAL, SO THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP MARREN'S CASE OUT OF TRIAL IS TO FIND THE REAL CULPRIT."
00:11:15.175,00:11:18.303,Frank: THERE ARE 52 EMPLOYEES AT TRUDEAU SECURITIES.
00:11:18.303,00:11:24.601,"YOUR JOB IS TO INTERVIEW THEM PRETENDING IT'S CASE RESEARCH, OF COURSE, UNTIL YOU FIND US A TRAITOR."
00:11:24.601,00:11:26.685,HAPPY HUNTING.
00:11:26.685,00:11:30.273,HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF HER EMPLOYEES?
00:11:30.273,00:11:32.609,I JUST KNOW EVERYBODY HATES THEIR BOSS.
00:11:39.073,00:11:41.951,SHE'S RIGHT. I HATE HER.
00:11:41.951,00:11:44.078,CAREFUL.
00:11:44.078,00:11:46.289,HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIND TIME TO STUDY FOR TORTS?
00:11:46.289,00:11:48.416,"OH, ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO STUDY?"
00:11:48.416,00:11:51.002,YOU CAN'T BE NATURALLY GIFTED AT TORTS.
00:11:51.002,00:11:52.462,AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT'S PSYCHED ABOUT THIS?
00:11:52.462,00:11:54.088,WE GET TO BE SPIES!
00:11:54.088,00:11:56.049,HOW DID YOU GET INTO THE COMPANY?
00:11:56.049,00:11:57.676,I WAS SELLING CARS WHEN I MET MARREN.
00:11:57.676,00:12:00.178,SHE CAME IN FOR AN S-CLASS BUT LEFT IN AN AMG.
00:12:00.178,00:12:02.681,"SHE SAID IF I COULD SELL HER THAT HARD, SHE HAD A JOB FOR ME."
00:12:02.681,00:12:04.891,"AND EVER SINCE, NEVER ONCE THOUGHT ABOUT LEAVING?"
00:12:04.891,00:12:07.352,HELL NO.
00:12:07.352,00:12:11.772,"LIKE WHEN MY DAD DIED, SHE GAVE MY MOM HER HOUSE IN THE CATSKILLS FOR A FEW MONTHS SO SHE COULD GRIEVE IN PEACE."
00:12:11.772,00:12:13.525,"WELL, THAT'S VERY GENEROUS."
00:12:13.525,00:12:15.443,YOU KNOW HOW MANY HOUSES SHE HAS?
00:12:15.443,00:12:17.404,"SO, DOES THAT MEAN YOU DON'T MAKE THAT MUCH YOURSELF?"
00:12:17.404,00:12:19.447,Gene: I'M SOMEWHERE IN THE SEVEN-FIGURE RANGE.
00:12:19.447,00:12:21.449,"DEPENDS ON THE DAY, REALLY, WHETHER THE MARKET'S UP OR DOWN."
00:12:21.449,00:12:27.414,"SO, WHAT'S THE MOST YOU'VE MADE ON A TRADE AT ONE TI-- DO I SOUND LIKE I AM CALLING YOU FROM CLUB FED?"
00:12:27.414,00:12:32.627,"WE ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS, AND THE MARKET IS KISSING 17 AGAIN, YOU PUNK-ASS BITCH, WHOSE..."
00:12:32.627,00:12:34.421,...DRESS IS AMAZING.
00:12:36.172,00:12:39.342,I'M NOT LIKE MOST GIRLS.
00:12:39.342,00:12:42.011,TOP BROKER.
00:12:42.011,00:12:43.804,WE DON'T MAKE EXCUSES AROUND HERE.
00:12:43.804,00:12:46.474,Asher: THAT'S QUITE THE CAT COLLECTION.
00:12:46.474,00:12:49.227,YOU NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT MY PUSSIES. WHAT DO YOU WANT?
00:12:49.227,00:12:51.730,YOU MEAN BESIDES WORLD PEACE?
00:12:51.730,00:12:54.482,HOW IS IT WORKING FOR MARREN?
00:12:54.482,00:12:57.944,"JUST BETWEEN US, IT SEEMS LIKE SHE COULD BE A REAL BALL-BUSTER."
00:12:57.944,00:12:59.487,WOULD YOU CALL A MAN A BALL-BUSTER?
00:12:59.487,00:13:03.157,"I'M GUESSING NO, MR. CAN'T STOP STARING AT MY BOOBS."
00:13:03.157,00:13:04.783,HUH.
00:13:03.157,00:13:06.827,"Laurel: ILLEGAL TRADES -- THEY HAPPEN ALL THE TIME, THOUGH, RIGHT?"
00:13:06.827,00:13:08.413,"I MEAN, THAT'S HOW WE ENDED UP WITH OUR CURRENT RECESSION."
00:13:08.413,00:13:10.081,"OKAY, THAT'S LIBERAL PROPAGANDA."
00:13:10.081,00:13:12.125,WANTING AND MAKING MONEY AIN'T A BAD THING.
00:13:12.125,00:13:15.587,"AND HONESTLY, TO ACTUALLY PULL OFF INSIDER TRADING AND NOT GET CAUGHT..."
00:13:15.587,00:13:17.213,IT'S QUITE EASY.
00:13:15.587,00:13:21.134,"AN EXAMPLE -- MY BROTHER-IN-LAW'S COMPANY, DENZOTECH, IS BEING BOUGHT BY GOOGLE."
00:13:21.134,00:13:22.801,THEY ANNOUNCE IT IN THE TRADES TOMORROW.
00:13:22.801,00:13:27.014,"SHOULD MAKE A KILLING, BUT I HAVE TO SIT ON MY HANDS BECAUSE OF MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE."
00:13:27.014,00:13:31.436,"BUT IF YOU ACTED ON IT, YOU COULD MAKE, SAY, 100 GRAND?"
00:13:31.436,00:13:34.689,CHUMP CHANGE.
00:13:34.689,00:13:36.232,THINK EVERYONE'S AS HAPPY AS YOU ARE TO WORK FOR MARREN?
00:13:36.232,00:13:38.485,WE ALL MAKE BANK.
00:13:38.485,00:13:41.446,"EVAN, MARREN NEEDS THE DALZINE NUMBERS."
00:13:41.446,00:13:43.072,WHO'S THIS?
00:13:43.072,00:13:45.450,CONNOR WALSH.
00:13:45.450,00:13:48.745,PAXTON.
00:13:50.829,00:13:53.374,YOU TWO NEED A ROOM?
00:13:53.374,00:13:55.126,WHY DO I NEED TO READ THESE?
00:13:55.126,00:13:57.211,IT'S ALL THE PENDING LITIGATION AGAINST MARREN.
00:14:00.507,00:14:02.592,"OH, NO."
00:14:00.507,00:14:04.969,I'M NOT -- I'M -- I HOPE YOU'RE NOT AS BAD A LAW STUDENT AS YOU ARE A LIAR.
00:14:04.969,00:14:06.680,Carla: YOU WANT TO ASK ME OUT ON A DATE?
00:14:06.680,00:14:08.556,ASK ME ON A DATE.
00:14:11.601,00:14:14.228,"OKAY, LOOK, I WASN'T -- THE GOODIES ARE VERY, UM..."
00:14:14.228,00:14:17.398,BUT THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.
00:14:17.398,00:14:20.610,HONESTLY...
00:14:17.398,00:14:22.487,WE THINK THERE'S A BENEDICT ARNOLD UP IN THIS JOINT.
00:14:22.487,00:14:24.781,Marren: HOW DARE YOU?
00:14:24.781,00:14:28.660,"NO, SEE, 'CAUSE I TOLD YOU IT WAS AN OUTSIDE HACK."
00:14:28.660,00:14:31.579,SO WHY IN THE HELL ARE YOU INTERROGATING MY EMPLOYEES?
00:14:31.579,00:14:35.709,"AS YOUR ATTORNEY, IT'S MY JOB TO LOOK OUT FOR YOUR BEST INTERESTS."
00:14:35.709,00:14:38.878,BY CREATING A CULTURE OF FEAR WITHIN MY COMPANY?
00:14:38.878,00:14:41.464,A HEALTHY LEVEL OF FEAR ALL EMPLOYEES SHOULD HAVE FOR THEIR BOSS.
00:14:41.464,00:14:44.801,THOSE PEOPLE ARE MY FAMILY.
00:14:41.464,00:14:46.678,"THEY'RE YOUR EMPLOYEES, AND THEY'LL BURN YOU THE FIRST CHANCE THEY GET."
00:14:46.678,00:14:48.680,"OH, GOD."
00:14:48.680,00:14:50.640,"I MEAN, YOU EXHAUST ME."
00:14:50.640,00:14:52.600,THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.
00:14:52.600,00:15:06.406,"NO, YOU KNOW, ALL THE YEARS THAT YOU'VE BEEN MY LAWYER, THROUGH DIVORCES AND SEXUAL-HARASSMENT SUITS, YOU HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW ALL MY CRAZY, BUT I STILL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOU."
00:15:06.406,00:15:09.659,"UNTIL NOW, OF COURSE."
00:15:09.659,00:15:12.119,"NOT YOUR EMPLOYEES, YOUR CLIENTS."
00:15:12.119,00:15:15.498,"OH, I WOULD BE AN IDIOT TO TRUST MY CLIENTS."
00:15:15.498,00:15:20.086,"SO, NOBODY."
00:15:21.087,00:15:24.048,NOBODY?
00:15:24.048,00:15:29.804,"MARREN, IF YOU WANT TO FIRE ME -- NO, STOP TRYING TO WIGGLE OUT OF THIS ONE."
00:15:29.804,00:15:32.766,YOU KNOW YOU'RE MY BEST CHANCE TO BEAT THIS CHARGE.
00:15:34.642,00:15:38.521,STOP INVESTIGATING MY PEOPLE.
00:15:38.521,00:15:40.607,"OH, OKAY."
00:15:40.607,00:15:43.693,WHAT?
00:15:43.693,00:15:47.655,"IF THIS WERE MY HUSBAND, I'D NEVER BE ABLE TO WALK STRAIGHT AGAIN."
00:15:55.162,00:15:56.790,ARE YOU GOING OUT?
00:15:56.790,00:15:59.667,DEPARTMENT DINNER.
00:15:59.667,00:16:02.128,I TOLD YOU THIS MORNING.
00:16:03.755,00:16:05.965,ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
00:16:07.634,00:16:10.637,MM.
00:16:10.637,00:16:13.932,IS THAT A BAD THING?
00:16:15.224,00:16:18.603,I'LL BE HOME AS SOON AS I CAN.
00:16:21.397,00:16:24.776,McCLAINE'S BEING A REAL HARD ASS ABOUT THESE DINNERS.
00:16:24.776,00:16:27.570,ALL RIGHT.
00:16:44.170,00:16:47.340,THERE WAS A LECTURE YOU SCHEDULED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
00:16:47.340,00:16:50.092,DR. KEATING DIDN'T SHOW.
00:16:50.092,00:16:53.053,HIS CAR WAS IN THE LOT EVERY NIGHT...EXCEPT HERE.
00:16:53.053,00:16:54.514,"FRIDAY, THE 29th."
00:17:08.736,00:17:11.698,CAN I HELP YOU?
00:17:11.698,00:17:14.074,JUST OUT FOR A NIGHT RUN.
00:17:14.074,00:17:16.369,I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BURN OUT THE BATTERY.
00:17:19.205,00:17:21.415,"I'M NOT TRYING TO STEAL YOUR CAR, MAN."
00:17:21.415,00:17:24.878,DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE.
00:17:48.568,00:17:50.319,"IT'S FUNNY, RIGHT?"
00:17:50.319,00:17:58.118,WE'RE DRIVING SO FAR OUT OF THE CITY TO BUY SOME LIGHTER FLUID WHEN...WE'RE ALREADY SCREWED.
00:17:58.118,00:18:21.809,"I MEAN, I HATE TO BE ALL NEGATIVE HERE, BUT ASHER KNEW THAT WE WERE IN THE HOUSE, AND THERE'S THAT -- THAT EYEWITNESS COP, OUR FINGERPRINTS AND HAIR AND -- AND SKIN CELLS AT THE CRIME SCENE, THE FIBERS FROM THIS RUG NOW EMBEDDED IN MY CAR, THESE STREET CAMERAS RECORDING US THIS VERY MINUTE."
00:18:21.809,00:18:24.896,EVERYONE SAY HELLO TO THE POLICE. HI!
00:18:24.896,00:18:29.483,AND LET'S NOT EVEN TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AFTER THE BODY'S BURNED.
00:18:29.483,00:18:31.861,NOW THAT -- THAT -- IS GOING TO BE THE FUN PART!
00:18:31.861,00:18:34.488,"ENOUGH, CONNOR."
00:18:34.488,00:18:36.991,YOU'RE RIGHT.
00:18:36.991,00:18:42.162,WHY -- WHY FREAK OUT ABOUT THINGS OUT OF OUR CONTROL?
00:18:44.665,00:18:47.001,PERFECT!
00:18:55.468,00:18:59.847,THE 11 EMPLOYEES I INTERVIEWED ARE EITHER ALL EXTREMELY GOOD LIARS OR THE HACK DIDN'T COME FROM INSIDE.
00:18:59.847,00:19:02.016,AND THE I.T. EXPERT?
00:19:02.016,00:19:06.062,SO WE'VE PISSED OFF OUR CLIENT AND HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT.
00:19:06.062,00:19:07.563,YOU'VE ALL OUTDONE YOURSELVES.
00:19:07.563,00:19:11.150,"ACTUALLY, IF IT'S -- IF IT'S OKAY, I'D LIKE TO LOOK INTO A POSSIBLE NEW LEAD."
00:19:11.150,00:19:12.735,"WELL, WHY YOU STILL STANDING THERE?"
00:19:12.735,00:19:15.822,DID YOU GET THE TAPE?
00:19:19.199,00:19:21.368,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
00:19:21.368,00:19:22.870,"OH, MY GOD."
00:19:22.870,00:19:25.623,I TOTALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS MY BAG.
00:19:25.623,00:19:27.667,SORRY.
00:19:27.667,00:19:30.169,"SERIOUSLY, MICHAELA?"
00:19:30.169,00:19:32.505,OKAY! DO NONE OF YOU CARE ABOUT THIS EXAM?
00:19:32.505,00:19:38.427,"IF WE FAIL, WE DROP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CLASS, AND FOR WHAT?!"
00:19:35.091,00:19:43.641,"TO IMPRESS A WOMAN WHO COULD GIVE A CRAP ABOUT ANYONE BUT HER LITTLE BUTT BOY HERE, WHO CONSTANTLY SCREWS UP, BUT SOMEHOW GETS TO KEEP THE TROPHY?!"
00:19:43.641,00:19:45.559,"YOU WANT THE TROPHY THAT BAD, MICHAELA, TAKE IT."
00:19:47.770,00:19:50.564,"YOU HAVE TO WIN IT, OTHERWISE IT MEANS NOTHING!"
00:19:50.564,00:19:53.400,IT'S PROM QUEEN.
00:19:53.400,00:19:55.736,I AM NOT THE SHOOTING STAR!
00:19:55.736,00:19:57.989,Kan: LAUREL?
00:20:05.371,00:20:07.581,SHE MAKES YOU WORK PRETTY LATE.
00:20:07.581,00:20:09.375,I'M COMPENSATED WELL.
00:20:09.375,00:20:11.585,AND WHAT ELSE AM I GONNA DO ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT?
00:20:11.585,00:20:13.921,I CAN THINK OF MORE FUN THINGS.
00:20:17.633,00:20:19.760,BE HONEST.
00:20:19.760,00:20:22.805,MADE THE TRADE?
00:20:22.805,00:20:28.061,DOES ANYONE KNOW ANYONE?
00:20:28.061,00:20:29.729,WOW. THAT WAS DEEP.
00:20:29.729,00:20:31.230,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
00:20:33.066,00:20:35.568,I'VE BEEN HER ASSISTANT EIGHT YEARS.
00:20:35.568,00:20:39.572,THERE'S NO WAY SHE'D BE STUPID ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT TRADE.
00:20:39.572,00:20:42.282,RIGHT.
00:20:42.282,00:20:44.118,I'LL GO.
00:20:44.118,00:20:46.412,AND YOU?
00:20:46.412,00:20:49.082,WHAT WOULD YOU NORMALLY BE DOING ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT?
00:20:49.082,00:20:51.834,"OR WHO, I MEAN?"
00:20:51.834,00:20:54.754,IS THERE A BOYFRIEND I SHOULD BE JEALOUS OF?
00:20:57.548,00:20:59.425,I DO...
00:21:03.470,00:21:05.514,...WHAT I WANT.
00:21:16.817,00:21:20.154,YEAH. I KNOW.
00:21:50.184,00:21:54.063,"I TALKED TO A FEW LEGAL AID FUNDS, AND THEY CAN PUT TOGETHER ALMOST $3,000 FOR REBECCA'S BAIL."
00:21:54.063,00:21:55.815,"WE NEED $100,000."
00:21:55.815,00:21:57.858,"HEY, WE'RE NOT ALL WORKING FOR BIG-BANK MILLIONAIRES HERE."
00:21:57.858,00:21:59.359,SHE CAN'T STAY IN THERE UNTIL THE TRIAL.
00:21:59.359,00:22:00.736,IT WILL MESS WITH HER HEAD.
00:22:00.736,00:22:02.571,WHAT IF WE INVEST THE 3 GRAND?
00:22:02.571,00:22:05.449,FIND A STOCK THAT WE KNOW MIGHT DO WELL AND THEN...
00:22:05.449,00:22:07.326,WHAT?
00:22:07.326,00:22:10.871,"NO, NO, THAT -- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN. I -- Frank: KITCHEN'S FOR GROWN-UPS ONLY."
00:22:10.871,00:22:13.249,"AND, YEAH, I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT REBECCA."
00:22:13.249,00:22:15.251,DO WE NEED TO GET YOU A NAUGHTY MAT?
00:22:15.251,00:22:19.463,I ASKED KAN TO COME HELP US WITH REBECCA'S BAIL.
00:22:19.463,00:22:22.675,'CAUSE NO ONE ELSE IS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO GET HER OUT?
00:22:22.675,00:22:24.135,"YOU, THIS IS A PLACE OF WORK."
00:22:24.135,00:22:25.886,YOUR GIRLFRIEND SHOULD KNOW BETTER.
00:22:25.886,00:22:28.681,"FRANK -- HEY, HEY. NO WORRIES."
00:22:28.681,00:22:31.725,I'M JUST STOKED SOMEONE THINKS THAT I'M YOUR BOYFRIEND.
00:22:41.735,00:22:43.737,Paxton: NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE.
00:22:43.737,00:22:45.990,SEX AT THE OFFICE?
00:22:45.990,00:22:48.450,THAT OTHER THING YOU DID.
00:22:49.785,00:22:51.620,"OH, I'LL GO."
00:22:51.620,00:22:53.289,NO.
00:22:53.289,00:22:55.708,"LOOK, ONLY YOUR BOYFRIEND WOULD BE CALLING THIS LATE."
00:22:55.708,00:22:58.836,"NO, IT'S -- I-I GOT TO GO ANYWAY, ALL RIGHT?"
00:23:04.758,00:23:07.469,HEY.
00:23:07.469,00:23:09.055,IT'S FINE.
00:23:09.055,00:23:10.723,THEY STILL THINK IT'S HER.
00:23:10.723,00:23:12.808,I KNOW.
00:23:12.808,00:23:16.770,I ACTUALLY JUST HOOKED UP WITH ONE OF THE LAWYER'S INTERNS TO MAKE SURE.
00:23:18.356,00:23:21.859,WHAT CAN I SAY? I'M FULLY COMMITTED TO THE CAUSE.
00:23:21.859,00:23:25.238,AND HE DID THIS THING TO MY ASS THAT MADE MY EYES WATER.
00:23:39.543,00:23:40.878,"HEY, GUYS."
00:23:40.878,00:23:42.838,I THINK I JUST DETACHED THE TIBIA.
00:23:42.838,00:23:45.174,OR IS THAT A FIBULA?
00:23:47.968,00:23:51.513,"OH, THERE'S PLENTY MORE OF SAM TO BAG, THOUGH."
00:23:51.513,00:23:55.017,"MICHAELA, A LITTLE HELP."
00:23:55.017,00:23:57.144,I JUST NEED A BREAK.
00:23:57.144,00:24:01.023,NO BREAKS.
00:23:57.144,00:24:03.483,"WE ARE IN A MARATHON, AND YOU'VE HIT THE WALL, BUT WE HAVE SIX MORE MILES TO GO."
00:24:25.005,00:24:27.425,"Oliver: IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED, REALLY."
00:24:27.425,00:24:33.055,YOU JUST DOWNLOAD THIS APP FROM THE DEEP WEB AND WORM YOUR WAY INTO THE PHONE COMPANY'S MAINFRAME USING BASIC JAVA CODE.
00:24:33.055,00:24:34.932,ANYONE COULD LEARN HOW TO DO IT.
00:24:34.932,00:24:36.558,I-I JUST -- I DON'T CARE.
00:24:36.558,00:24:39.395,HEY.
00:24:39.395,00:24:41.188,I COULD GET ARRESTED FOR THIS.
00:24:41.188,00:24:42.648,I WOULD NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN.
00:24:42.648,00:24:48.695,"SAYS THE FIRST-YEAR LAW STUDENT, WHO SEEMS TO SPEND MORE TIME BREAKING THE LAW THAN PRACTICING IT."
00:24:48.695,00:24:54.285,"WERE YOU, LIKE, HIDING UNDER HIS DESK, OR WERE YOU ALREADY UNDER THERE FOR OTHER PURPOSES?"
00:24:54.285,00:24:57.704,"I WOULD TELL YOU, BUT THEN YOU'D BE AN ACCESSORY TO MY CRIME."
00:24:57.704,00:24:59.748,OH.
00:24:59.748,00:25:02.793,VOILà.
00:24:59.748,00:25:05.004,PERSON HE WAS ON THE PHONE WITH WAS USING A PHONE LINE IN TRUDEAU SECURITIES.
00:25:05.004,00:25:08.590,"I MEAN, WHOEVER IT WAS WAS SMART ENOUGH TO BLOCK THE IDENTIFYING NUMBER."
00:25:08.590,00:25:10.301,DUDE.
00:25:10.301,00:25:12.510,"YOU LOVE ME, AND YOU WANT TO HAVE MY BABIES."
00:25:12.510,00:25:14.680,I KNOW.
00:25:16.432,00:25:18.351,Bonnie: SERGEANT JOSEPH?
00:25:18.351,00:25:21.312,BONNIE WINTERBOTTOM.
00:25:21.312,00:25:22.813,MS. PARKS WARNED ME YOU'D BE COMING BY.
00:25:22.813,00:25:25.649,A LITTLE ADVICE?
00:25:25.649,00:25:27.485,I'VE SEEN THE CONFESSION.
00:25:29.695,00:25:32.448,THEN EXPLAIN THIS.
00:25:32.448,00:25:38.954,"IF YOUR DEPARTMENT IS SO SURE MS. SUTTER IS GUILTY, THEN WHY IS ONE OF YOUR DETECTIVES INVESTIGATING A DIFFERENT SUSPECT?"
00:25:38.954,00:25:45.961,"DETECTIVE NATE LAHEY HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING SAM KEATING, WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE HUSBAND OF THE WOMAN DETECTIVE LAHEY HAD AN AFFAIR WITH."
00:25:45.961,00:25:49.215,YOU'RE OUT OF LINE.
00:25:45.961,00:25:52.259,I HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE THAT DETECTIVE LAHEY ILLEGALLY SEARCHED THROUGH MR. KEATING'S CAR LAST NIGHT.
00:25:52.259,00:26:00.684,"SO YOU CAN SEE WHY I'M HAVING A HARD TIME ACCEPTING YOUR CONFIDENCE IN MS. SUTTER'S CONFESSION WHEN, IN FACT, YOUR MEN ARE STILL OUT THERE LOOKING FOR MS. STANGARD'S KILLER."
00:26:00.684,00:26:02.895,"I MEAN, A JURY WOULD DEFINITELY FIND IT CONFUSING."
00:26:02.895,00:26:11.653,"AND IF THE PRESS GOT A HOLD OF IT, WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME YOUR WHOLE DEPARTMENT COULD COME UNDER REVIEW."
00:26:11.653,00:26:13.406,Paxton: WHAT CAN I SAY?
00:26:13.406,00:26:15.615,I'M FULLY COMMITTED TO THE CAUSE.
00:26:15.615,00:26:17.951,AND HE DID THIS THING TO MY ASS THAT MADE MY EYES WATER.
00:26:17.951,00:26:20.287,"ALL RIGHT, TURN IT -- TURN IT OFF."
00:26:20.287,00:26:24.791,"BASED ON THE PHONE CALL, WE KNOW THAT PAX WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE INSIDE YOUR BROKERAGE."
00:26:24.791,00:26:26.835,"AND AS YOUR ASSISTANT, HE HAD ACCESS TO YOUR LOGIN CODE."
00:26:26.835,00:26:27.961,HE SET YOU UP.
00:26:27.961,00:26:34.385,HE -- HE -- HE'S BEEN WITH ME SINCE MY OFFICE WAS A DESK IN MY APARTMENT.
00:26:34.385,00:26:37.179,HE BOUGHT ME MY FIRST PAIR OF SPANX.
00:26:40.640,00:26:43.227,"OKAY, YOU CAN SAY IT."
00:26:43.227,00:26:45.104,I TOLD YOU SO.
00:26:45.104,00:26:47.481,THE IMPORTANT THING IS WE KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.
00:26:47.481,00:26:49.483,WE JUST NEED HIM TO MAKE A STATEMENT.
00:26:49.483,00:26:51.569,"OH, I'LL GET HIM TO MAKE A STATEMENT."
00:26:51.569,00:26:54.654,"YOU WEAK, LITTLE BITCH."
00:26:54.654,00:26:55.906,MARREN.
00:26:55.906,00:26:57.615,WHAT?
00:26:57.615,00:26:59.452,YOU SET ME UP FOR THIS.
00:26:59.452,00:27:01.495,I'M LOYAL TO MY BOSS.
00:27:01.495,00:27:04.373,NO ONE ELSE.
00:27:04.373,00:27:13.466,"ALL I'VE DONE THE PAST EIGHT YEARS IS PAY YOUR BILLS, CLEAN UP AFTER YOUR DOG, BUY YOUR TAMPONS!"
00:27:13.466,00:27:16.093,MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN ABOUT YOU!
00:27:16.093,00:27:18.178,SERVING YOU!
00:27:18.178,00:27:24.351,"LIKE ALL I AM IS SOME ACCESSORY, THIS THING TO PROP YOU UP!"
00:27:24.351,00:27:27.354,THIS WAS MY CHANCE TO BE SOMETHING.
00:27:29.940,00:27:34.487,I LOVED YOU LIKE YOU WERE MY SON.
00:27:34.487,00:27:36.530,AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?
00:27:39.199,00:27:41.619,"YOU COULD HAVE RUINED ME, MADE ME LOSE EVERYTHING!"
00:27:41.619,00:27:49.460,SO UNDERSTAND THIS -- I WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW FOR THIS CRIME.
00:27:49.460,00:28:06.977,"OH, AND THAT FAMILY OF YOURS, THOSE -- THOSE PEOPLE THAT JUST REJECTED YOU ALL THOSE YEARS AGO, WELL, NOW THEY ARE FINALLY GONNA HAVE A REAL REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF YOU, 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE IN JAIL WITH THE OTHER INMATES WHO ARE GONNA LOVE THE HELL OUT OF YOUR ASS!"
00:28:06.977,00:28:08.562,MARREN! MARREN!
00:28:08.562,00:28:10.981,PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.
00:28:12.566,00:28:14.234,I'M FINE.
00:28:14.234,00:28:16.529,I'M SORRY.
00:28:39.218,00:28:42.304,NOW YOU KNOW WHAT A SHOOTING STAR LOOKS LIKE.
00:28:46.392,00:28:53.106,"WE CAN REQUEST A CONTINUANCE ON THE PRELIMINARY HEARING, CITE AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE."
00:28:53.106,00:28:57.570,"OH, YOU MEAN THE PROOF OF MY INNOCENCE THAT JUST WENT OUT THE WINDOW?"
00:28:59.196,00:29:03.992,"I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THOSE THINGS, NOT TO HIM."
00:29:03.992,00:29:06.119,HE ISN'T TOUGH LIKE ME.
00:29:06.119,00:29:07.705,I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.
00:29:07.705,00:29:10.457,YOU DIDN'T DO THIS TO HIM.
00:29:10.457,00:29:13.043,"ANNALISE, I DID."
00:29:13.043,00:29:14.587,NO.
00:29:14.587,00:29:18.215,"HE WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE ELSE WITHIN THE BUILDING, WHICH MEANS THEY'RE AT FAULT."
00:29:18.215,00:29:21.218,"THEY COMMITTED THIS CRIME, NOT YOU."
00:29:21.218,00:29:23.220,LET ME FIX THIS.
00:29:28.767,00:29:33.105,"Frank: ACCORDING TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE, THE PURCHASE ORDER FOR THE EDSON SHARES WENT IN AT 2:48 P.M."
00:29:33.105,00:29:36.692,"MARREN SAYS SHE'S WAS ON A SMOKE BREAK, SO WE JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHO MADE THE TRADE ON HER COMPUTER."
00:29:36.692,00:29:39.111,PAX WOULD HAVE SEEN MARREN LEAVE.
00:29:39.111,00:29:41.488,HE COULD HAVE TOLD ONE OF THE OTHER BROKERS TO MAKE THE TRADE AT HER DESK.
00:29:41.488,00:29:44.324,TALIA LEWIS LOGGED OUT OF HER ACCOUNT AT 2:45 P.M.
00:29:44.324,00:29:46.159,I INTERVIEWED HER.
00:29:46.159,00:29:48.495,IT'S ALL THE PENDING LITIGATION AGAINST MARREN.
00:29:51.831,00:29:54.084,ANYONE ELSE?
00:29:54.084,00:29:57.170,HE LOGGED OUT AT 2:46 P.M.
00:29:57.170,00:29:58.964,WANTING AND MAKING MONEY AIN'T A BAD THING.
00:29:58.964,00:30:00.840,THE GUY SMELLED LIKE AN ASHTRAY.
00:30:00.840,00:30:02.384,WAIT.
00:30:02.384,00:30:08.014,WHAT IF JIMMY DISTRACTED MARREN ON THE SMOKE BREAK WHILE TALIA MADE THE DEAL AND PAX STOOD WATCH?
00:30:08.014,00:30:11.184,HOLY CRAP.
00:30:11.184,00:30:17.857,GETTING A WITNESS TO CONFESS IS PERHAPS THE MOST CHALLENGING YET FUN PARTS OF BEING A TRIAL ATTORNEY.
00:30:17.857,00:30:21.445,"DEPOSITIONS IN CRIMINAL CASES ARE HIGHLY IRREGULAR, MS. KEATING."
00:30:21.445,00:30:23.113,AN EMPLOYEE JUST KILLED HIMSELF.
00:30:23.113,00:30:27.242,"IF THAT'S NOT AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS."
00:30:27.242,00:30:29.286,WE NEED TO PRESERVE ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES' TESTIMONIES NOW.
00:30:29.286,00:30:31.705,"OH, ARE YOU EXPECTING FURTHER DEATHS?"
00:30:31.705,00:30:34.291,"HOPEFULLY NOT, BUT WE'LL SEE HOW THE DAY GOES."
00:30:34.291,00:30:36.710,"HEY, YOU READY FOR ME?"
00:30:36.710,00:30:39.212,JIMMY. SIT DOWN.
00:30:39.212,00:30:45.511,"YOU START WITH SOFTBALLS, QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL LIFE, FAMILY, ANYTHING TO WARM THEM UP."
00:30:45.511,00:30:48.096,SURE. I TAKE SMOKE BREAKS WITH MARREN ALL THE TIME.
00:30:48.096,00:30:52.559,AND DID YOU HAPPEN TO TAKE A SMOKE BREAK AT 2:45 P.M. WITH MARREN ON THE 16th?
00:30:52.559,00:30:54.603,CAN'T BE SURE EXACTLY.
00:30:52.559,00:30:56.814,"MS. KEATING, WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING?"
00:30:56.814,00:31:03.111,"MARREN BOUGHT THE EDSON STOCK AT 2:48 P.M. ON THE 16th, AND THAT'S THE SAME TIME OF DAY THAT YOU AND MARREN WOULD OFTEN TAKE YOUR SMOKE BREAKS."
00:31:03.111,00:31:04.446,ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
00:31:04.446,00:31:06.948,YOU'RE NO LONGER A LAWYER.
00:31:06.948,00:31:10.118,YOU'RE A DETECTIVE IN AN INTERROGATION.
00:31:10.118,00:31:13.747,I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS A CRIME TO BE LOGGED OUT OF MY COMPUTER SYSTEM.
00:31:13.747,00:31:16.834,JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL US WHERE YOU WERE AT THAT TIME.
00:31:16.834,00:31:18.836,"I DON'T KNOW. GETTING COFFEE, GOING TO THE RESTROOM."
00:31:18.836,00:31:21.421,YOU SURE YOU WEREN'T BUYING EDSON STOCK ON MARREN'S COMPUTER?
00:31:21.421,00:31:23.340,WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
00:31:23.340,00:31:27.386,"TAKE MARREN DOWN, START YOUR OWN COMPANY USING HER CLIENTS."
00:31:27.386,00:31:29.471,YOU DON'T ASK FOR THE TRUTH.
00:31:29.471,00:31:34.267,"YOU POUND IT OUT OF THEM, RELENTLESS IN YOUR PURSUIT OF THE ANSWER YOU WANT."
00:31:34.267,00:31:36.812,"SO, YOU AND JIMMY DIDN'T PLAN TO START YOUR OWN COMPANY?"
00:31:36.812,00:31:39.815,NO.
00:31:39.815,00:31:43.861,THAT'S NOT WHAT HE TOLD US IN HIS DEPOSITION.
00:31:43.861,00:31:46.946,TALIA TOLD US IT WAS YOUR IDEA.
00:31:46.946,00:31:49.199,I'D LIKE TO LEAVE NOW.
00:31:46.946,00:31:54.663,"WELL, OF COURSE WE CAN'T FORCE YOU TO BE HERE AGAINST YOUR WILL, BUT YOU WILL GET A BETTER DEAL FROM ME IF YOU ANSWER MORE OF MS. KEATING'S QUESTIONS."
00:31:56.081,00:31:59.167,"TALIA'S LYING, OKAY?"
00:31:59.167,00:32:01.169,SHE ROPED ME IN AND THEN PAX.
00:32:01.169,00:32:02.962,WE WERE JUST ALONG FOR THE RIDE.
00:32:02.962,00:32:05.465,"MR. WORDSHAW, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST."
00:32:05.465,00:32:09.344,WAIT. HOLD -- YOU -- YOU SAID YOU'D MAKE A DEAL.
00:32:09.344,00:32:12.305,PROSECUTORS SAY ALL KINDS OF THINGS.
00:32:12.305,00:32:16.309,"AND NEXT TIME, YOU MIGHT WANT TO READ THE EVIDENCE PUT IN FRONT OF YOU."
00:32:16.309,00:32:20.606,THAT DEPOSITION WASN'T REAL?
00:32:20.606,00:32:24.818,THAT'S A SPEECH MARREN WROTE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF FEMALE BONDING IN THE WORKPLACE.
00:32:29.448,00:32:33.452,"LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE GREEDY, LITTLE PIGS."
00:32:36.413,00:32:41.960,LOOKS LIKE YOU FATTENED YOURSELVES UP FOR THE SLAUGHTER.
00:32:41.960,00:32:44.337,I WAS JUST GOING WHAT YOU TAUGHT US.
00:32:44.337,00:32:46.423,"YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING, MARREN."
00:32:46.423,00:32:48.133,NO.
00:32:48.133,00:32:50.803,I WOULD HAVE MADE MY OWN COMPANY.
00:32:50.803,00:32:52.512,AS I DID.
00:32:52.512,00:32:55.181,DID YOU REALLY THINK THAT YOU COULD BURN ME?
00:32:55.181,00:32:59.478,"AND YOU TOOK TRUSTING, NAIVE PAX DOWN WITH YOU."
00:32:59.478,00:33:03.565,ENJOY YOUR STAY AT CLUB FED.
00:33:21.333,00:33:22.876,WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
00:33:22.876,00:33:25.629,WE HAVE 14 HOURS TILL TORTS.
00:33:25.629,00:33:27.798,WILL THIS HELP?
00:33:27.798,00:33:30.425,THE TILLMAN OUTLINE?
00:33:30.425,00:33:32.344,CALLED MY COUSIN.
00:33:32.344,00:33:35.180,TURNS OUT HE WAS IN AN EATING CLUB WITH THE GUY AT PRINCETON.
00:33:35.180,00:33:36.556,WHO WANTS A COPY?
00:33:36.556,00:33:39.058,"OH, MY GOD!"
00:33:39.058,00:33:41.645,SUCKERS! YOU THINK I'M GONNA LET YOU ALL BUST MY CURVE ON THE EXAM?
00:33:41.645,00:33:42.855,WHAT?
00:33:42.855,00:33:45.607,MOVIE TIME.
00:33:45.607,00:33:47.693,Rebecca: GRIFFIN WAS ON TOP OF HER.
00:33:47.693,00:33:54.992,"LILA WAS SHOUTING...FOR HELP, SCREAMING, SCRATCHING AT HIM."
00:33:57.327,00:34:00.622,HE HAD HIS HANDS AROUND HER NECK.
00:34:00.622,00:34:02.457,HOW DID YOU FINALLY GET THIS?
00:34:02.457,00:34:04.417,WENDY'S ASSISTANT HAS A MESSY DESK.
00:34:04.417,00:34:07.963,MAYBE SOMETHING FELL OFF.
00:34:07.963,00:34:09.464,GOOD JOB.
00:34:13.134,00:34:14.845,Detective: YOU WERE STANDING DURING ALL THIS?
00:34:18.306,00:34:19.432,NO?
00:34:19.432,00:34:21.810,YOU WERE SITTING?
00:34:21.810,00:34:25.522,WHICH MEANS YOU WERE CLOSE ENOUGH TO HOLD HER LEGS.
00:34:25.522,00:34:26.773,YES.
00:34:26.773,00:34:28.650,"SURE HAVE GOOD TASTE, WAITLIST."
00:34:28.650,00:34:30.443,GO BACK.
00:34:30.443,00:34:33.405,RIGHT THERE.
00:34:38.035,00:34:39.202,NO?
00:34:41.454,00:34:45.291,WHICH MEANS YOU WERE CLOSE ENOUGH TO HOLD HER LEGS.
00:34:45.291,00:34:46.626,YES.
00:34:46.626,00:34:52.758,"YOUR HONOR, THIS SECTION OF VIDEO WAS NOT A PART OF THE WRITTEN CONFESSION."
00:34:52.758,00:34:59.639,CLEARLY IT'S BECAUSE MY CLIENT WAS MANIPULATED INTO SAYING THAT SHE WAS TOUCHING THE VICTIM'S BODY BY THE DETECTIVES IN ORDER TO FURTHER INCRIMINATE HER.
00:34:59.639,00:35:02.141,"SHE'S REACHING, YOUR HONOR."
00:35:02.141,00:35:05.270,THE VIDEO COMPLETELY UNDERMINES THE RELIABILITY OF THE DOCUMENT.
00:35:05.270,00:35:07.188,OBJECTION. RELEVANCE.
00:35:07.188,00:35:08.732,THE VIDEO SHOWS COERCION.
00:35:08.732,00:35:12.360,"IN LIGHT OF THIS, I'M REDUCING BAIL TO $100,000."
00:35:12.360,00:35:17.407,I AM ALSO INITIATING AN INQUIRY INTO THE INTERROGATION OF MS. SUTTER.
00:35:17.407,00:35:20.118,"MS. PARKS, I'M NOT HAPPY."
00:35:28.209,00:35:30.045,"I CAN'T AFFORD $100,000."
00:35:30.045,00:35:33.715,"IT'S 10% OF $100,000, AND WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED."
00:35:33.715,00:35:36.301,"REBECCA, SMILE."
00:36:01.660,00:36:03.578,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
00:36:03.578,00:36:06.999,I-I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
00:36:10.836,00:36:12.170,NO. I WISH.
00:36:12.170,00:36:14.339,UGH.
00:36:14.339,00:36:17.134,YOU SMELL.
00:36:17.134,00:36:19.886,"I SCREWED UP, OLIVER."
00:36:19.886,00:36:21.930,I SCREWED UP SO BAD.
00:36:24.766,00:36:27.853,I SCREWED UP.
00:36:30.105,00:36:33.108,I SCREWED UP.
00:36:35.485,00:36:39.072,I SCREWED -- I SCREWED UP.
00:36:39.072,00:36:41.700,I SCREWED UP.
00:36:41.700,00:36:44.327,I SCREWED UP.
00:36:46.872,00:36:50.000,I SCREWED UP.
00:36:51.501,00:36:56.048,IT JUST SHOWS THAT NOT EVERYONE IS BORN TO HAVE A HIGH-PRESSURE JOB.
00:36:56.048,00:37:01.053,"I MEAN, LIKE THIS GUY, GOT IN OVER HIS HEAD AND CRACKED."
00:37:01.053,00:37:04.472,"LITERALLY, HIS HEAD ON THE SIDEWALK."
00:37:06.599,00:37:10.436,I ACTUALLY JUST HOOKED UP WITH ONE OF THE LAWYER'S INTERNS TO MAKE SURE.
00:37:10.436,00:37:12.522,WHAT CAN I SAY?
00:37:12.522,00:37:14.524,I'M FULLY COMMITTED TO THE CAUSE.
00:37:14.524,00:37:18.361,AND HE DID THIS THING TO MY ASS THAT MADE MY EYES WATER.
00:37:23.449,00:37:29.247,I KEPT THINKING THERE WAS A REASON THAT YOU WERE SO PISSED AT HIM.
00:37:29.247,00:37:32.542,I WAS RIGHT.
00:37:33.459,00:37:35.587,COME ON. IT'S...
00:37:35.587,00:37:38.506,IT'S NOT LIKE WE SAID THAT WE WERE EXCLUSIVE.
00:37:42.761,00:37:44.804,GET OUT.
00:37:44.804,00:37:46.765,DON'T DO THIS.
00:37:46.765,00:37:49.893,"I LIKE YOU, ACTUALLY."
00:37:49.893,00:37:51.228,ACTUALLY?
00:37:51.228,00:37:55.190,"LOOK, OLIVER, THAT GUY, HE WAS JUST SEX, BUT YOU'RE MORE THAN SEX."
00:37:55.190,00:37:57.692,DON'T MAKE THIS A BIGGER DEAL THAN IT IS.
00:37:57.692,00:38:00.486,OLIVER.
00:38:17.879,00:38:20.882,HEY.
00:38:27.430,00:38:29.432,I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING TO YOU.
00:38:29.432,00:38:32.894,WHY ARE YOU?
00:38:32.894,00:38:35.772,PLEASE DON'T TELL ME IT'S 'CAUSE YOU WANT A THANK-YOU.
00:38:35.772,00:38:38.900,WE'LL SEE IF THIS LADY'S ANY GOOD.
00:38:38.900,00:38:40.777,MAYBE I'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO THANK YOU FOR.
00:38:40.777,00:38:41.778,IT'S NOT THAT.
00:38:44.281,00:38:45.907,IT'S THIS.
00:38:50.411,00:38:52.538,"TELL ME WHAT'S ON THE PHONE, REBECCA."
00:39:18.190,00:39:22.527,AND YOU THOUGHT KEEPING THIS FROM ME WOULD BE BENEFICIAL HOW?
00:39:22.527,00:39:24.988,SHE TRUSTS ME NOW.
00:39:24.988,00:39:26.531,BECAUSE I WAITED.
00:39:26.531,00:39:29.701,SHE -- SHE WOULDN'T IF I GAVE IT TO YOU BEFORE.
00:39:29.701,00:39:32.537,"I KNOW THAT SOUNDS BAD, BUT -- STOP."
00:39:36.166,00:39:38.584,DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW ABOUT THIS?
00:39:38.584,00:39:40.086,NO.
00:39:40.086,00:39:43.506,I NEED YOU TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME.
00:39:43.506,00:39:46.926,I SWEAR TO GOD.
00:39:49.554,00:39:51.681,YOU WERE RIGHT.
00:39:51.681,00:39:57.354,"SHE NEEDS SOMEONE TO TRUST, AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S YOU."
00:39:57.354,00:39:58.813,YOU OKAY WITH THAT?
00:40:00.732,00:40:05.278,"BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE, BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HER."
00:40:05.278,00:40:07.405,AND TO ME.
00:40:09.490,00:40:11.576,I CAN HANDLE IT.
00:40:11.576,00:40:16.373,"WE CAN USE IT, RIGHT?"
00:40:16.373,00:40:20.085,IT'LL HELP HER CASE.
00:40:20.085,00:40:23.421,WHY WOULDN'T WE?
00:40:20.085,00:40:25.506,"I MEAN, THOSE PHOTOS -- MR. GIBBINS, YOU DID YOUR JOB."
00:40:25.506,00:40:28.134,NOW LET ME DO MINE.
00:41:49.507,00:41:54.846,BONNIE JUST TOLD ME YOU GOT THE GIRL OUT ON BAIL.
00:41:54.846,00:41:57.932,JUST TELL ME YOU DIDN'T TAKE OUT A SECOND MORTGAGE TO PAY FOR IT.
00:41:59.934,00:42:02.520,"I CAME CLOSE, BUT WE FIGURED OUT ANOTHER WAY."
00:42:02.520,00:42:04.772,HMM.
00:42:04.772,00:42:06.399,SAM?
00:42:07.733,00:42:10.278,YEAH?
00:42:12.613,00:42:16.701,WHY IS YOUR PENIS ON A DEAD GIRL'S PHONE?
00:00:06.173,00:00:08.133,PREVIOUSLY ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER...
00:00:08.133,00:00:10.928,IT'S ABOUT THE LILA STANGARD MURDER. SAM KNEW HER.
00:00:10.928,00:00:15.557,"HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AT YALE THE NIGHT SHE WAS KILLED, AND I NEED FOR YOU TO TELL ME THAT HIS ALIBI CHECKS OUT."
00:00:15.557,00:00:17.685,OKAY.
00:00:22.397,00:00:25.233,"HE NEVER LEFT, ANNALISE."
00:00:25.233,00:00:28.153,"TELL ME WHAT'S ON THE PHONE, REBECCA."
00:00:28.153,00:00:29.697,Annalise: DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW ABOUT THIS?
00:00:29.697,00:00:31.281,ONLY REBECCA AND I KNOW IT EXISTS.
00:00:31.281,00:00:32.783,"WE CAN USE IT, RIGHT?"
00:00:32.783,00:00:34.576,WHY WOULDN'T WE?
00:00:32.783,00:00:37.663,"I MEAN, THOSE PHOTOS -- MR. GIBBINS, YOU DID YOUR JOB."
00:00:37.663,00:00:40.541,WHY IS YOUR PENIS ON A DEAD GIRL'S PHONE?
00:00:49.299,00:00:51.426,LET'S JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE NOW.
00:01:01.937,00:01:03.647,Flashlight!
00:01:03.647,00:01:06.358,"HEY, HEY. JEN CANNOT FIND OUT ABOUT THIS, OKAY?"
00:01:12.364,00:01:13.949,WHAT WAS THAT?
00:01:21.164,00:01:23.417,WHO'S THERE?!
00:01:24.710,00:01:26.754,CAN WE GO?
00:01:34.678,00:01:36.388,WHY IS FRANK CALLING YOU?
00:01:36.388,00:01:37.723,WHAT?
00:01:37.723,00:01:39.016,"I SAW YOUR PHONE, LAUREL."
00:01:39.016,00:01:41.936,WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
00:01:41.936,00:01:44.897,"LAUREL, PLEASE DON'T SAY YOU TOLD FRANK ABOUT THIS."
00:01:44.897,00:01:49.359,"YOU PEOPLE TELL ME THAT I CAN'T CALL AIDEN, AND YOU CALLED FRANK?"
00:01:49.359,00:01:55.616,"I SWEAR TO GOD, LAUREL, IF YOU TOLD HIM ANYTHING -- I SLEPT WITH HIM."
00:01:55.616,00:01:58.410,AND I DIDN'T CALL HIM.
00:01:55.616,00:02:02.330,HE'S CALLING ME BEC-- W-- WHATEVER.
00:02:02.330,00:02:04.207,"OTHERWISE, HOW DO WE KNOW YOU'RE TELLING US THE TRUTH?"
00:02:04.207,00:02:07.168,WHY WOULD I TELL YOU?
00:02:07.168,00:02:11.339,"WAIT. SO, YOU SCREWED FRANK WHILE YOU WERE STILL SEEING KAN?"
00:02:11.339,00:02:13.341,"I'M A CHEATER, YES."
00:02:13.341,00:02:17.262,AND A SLUT AND A BAD PERSON AND NOW A MURDERER.
00:02:17.262,00:02:19.056,JUDGE ME IF YOU WANT.
00:02:19.056,00:02:22.183,JUST DO IT WHILE WE'RE CARRYING THE DAMN BODY!
00:02:24.770,00:02:27.147,"Annalise: ALL PEOPLE HAVE SECRETS, MISS CASTILLO."
00:02:27.147,00:02:29.566,"CERTAINLY, YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WHEN PICKING A JURY."
00:02:29.566,00:02:34.989,"DEFINITELY. IN FACT, THERE'S BEEN A RISE IN STEALTH JURORS -- PEOPLE WHO ACTIVELY TRY TO GET ON A JURY TO SWAY THE VERDICT."
00:02:34.989,00:02:36.740,I KNOW WHAT A STEALTH JUROR IS.
00:02:39.952,00:02:44.498,"MR. JOHANSON, CAN YOU TELL ME -- I WASN'T SHOWING OFF."
00:02:44.498,00:02:46.708,"Oh, yeah, baby, it's on."
00:02:46.708,00:02:50.504,I WAS ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION -- HOW DO DEFENSE ATTORNEYS GET SCREWED BY JURIES?
00:02:50.504,00:02:53.548,MENTIONING STEALTH JURORS WAS ME GIVING AN EXAMPLE.
00:02:53.548,00:02:55.592,I WASN'T...SHOWING OFF.
00:02:59.429,00:03:02.141,SOMEBODY WOKE UP IN A MOOD TO FIGHT THIS MORNING.
00:03:02.141,00:03:04.434,MR. JOHANSON...
00:03:04.434,00:03:09.230,WHAT'S A SAMPLE QUESTION TO ASK DURING YOUR FIRST STAGE OF VOIR DIRE?
00:03:11.650,00:03:14.695,UM...HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT TO DO WITH THE PHONE?
00:03:14.695,00:03:16.321,NOT THE TIME NOR THE PLACE.
00:03:16.321,00:03:18.448,"I KNOW, BUT, UM..."
00:03:16.321,00:03:22.452,"I WAS THINKING BEFORE WE TURN IT OVER TO THE POLICE, WE CAN TRACE THE CELL NUMBER OF THE GUY WHO SENT THOSE PHOTOS."
00:03:22.452,00:03:24.579,I'M NOT SURE WE SHOULD TURN IT IN AT ALL.
00:03:24.579,00:03:26.665,Annalise: HOW LONG DID IT GO ON?
00:03:28.876,00:03:33.839,"DON'T YOU DARE SAY THAT YOU WERE JUST SENDING PHOTOS, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WERE SCREWING HER."
00:03:33.839,00:03:39.594,SO I NEED TO KNOW -- HOW LONG DID IT GO ON?
00:03:41.596,00:03:43.724,JUST THE SUMMER.
00:03:43.724,00:03:48.770,"SHE WAS IN MY CLASS, STARTED COMING TO MY OFFICE HOURS -- HOW MANY TIMES?"
00:03:48.770,00:03:50.731,I DON'T KNOW.
00:03:55.527,00:03:57.529,"SIX, SEVEN..."
00:03:57.529,00:03:58.572,WHERE?
00:04:00.490,00:04:01.825,MY OFFICE.
00:04:01.825,00:04:03.952,HER CAR ONCE.
00:04:03.952,00:04:06.580,"BUT YOU WANTED MORE THAN THAT, DIDN'T YOU?"
00:04:06.580,00:04:12.293,"IT TURNED YOU ON JUST TO THINK ABOUT LILA -- TOUCHING YOURSELF, TAKING THOSE PICTURES."
00:04:12.293,00:04:13.503,IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.
00:04:13.503,00:04:15.172,THEN WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME?!
00:04:15.172,00:04:17.424,I WAS AFRAID YOU'D THINK I HURT HER.
00:04:17.424,00:04:19.801,BUT I COULD NEVER DO THAT.
00:04:21.887,00:04:23.388,DID YOU LOVE HER?
00:04:23.388,00:04:25.140,NO.
00:04:25.140,00:04:27.684,IT -- IT WAS HER.
00:04:27.684,00:04:32.022,"SHE KEPT COMING TO ME ABOUT HER FAMILY, ABOUT HER BOYFRIEND."
00:04:32.022,00:04:34.315,"ANNIE, SHE WAS JUST LOST."
00:04:34.315,00:04:36.610,JUST LIKE YOU FOUND ME.
00:04:36.610,00:04:39.154,NO.
00:04:36.610,00:04:41.990,"THAT'S HOW YOU LIKE YOUR MISTRESSES, HUH -- WEAK, BROKEN MESSES THAT YOU JUST CLEAN UP."
00:04:41.990,00:04:45.244,"OKAY, THIS WAS NOT US."
00:04:45.244,00:04:48.413,TELL THAT TO YOUR FIRST WIFE.
00:04:50.124,00:04:51.374,YOU WERE THE ONE.
00:04:51.374,00:04:54.377,OH...
00:04:54.377,00:04:56.255,"THIS WAS JUST SEX, ANNIE."
00:04:56.255,00:04:58.090,"IT WAS NOTHING ELSE, OKAY?"
00:04:58.090,00:05:00.341,I LOVE YOU.
00:05:00.341,00:05:03.637,YOU DON'T GET TO -- DON'T TOUCH ME!
00:05:06.890,00:05:07.933,OW!
00:05:07.933,00:05:09.101,DON'T TOUCH ME!
00:05:09.101,00:05:10.560,JUST STOP IT.
00:05:10.560,00:05:11.812,YOU GET OUT!
00:05:11.812,00:05:13.939,YOU JUST GET OUT!
00:05:35.043,00:05:39.422,Wes: BUT IT'S WHAT YOU TAUGHT US THAT FIRST WEEK -- INTRODUCE A NEW SUSPECT.
00:05:39.422,00:05:44.136,DO WE? OR DOES THE FACT THAT REBECCA HAD LILA'S PHONE POINT TO HER AS THE KILLER?
00:05:44.136,00:05:45.971,ONLY IF WE DON'T FIND THAT GUY.
00:05:45.971,00:05:49.057,"IT'S MY DECISION TO MAKE, MR. GIBBINS."
00:05:49.057,00:05:54.604,WAIT. I -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE SO -- WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IS NOT MY CONCERN.
00:06:02.445,00:06:04.363,Ryan: HE DIDN'T DRINK ON THE WEEKDAYS.
00:06:06.116,00:06:08.285,SAID IT MADE HIM SLOW.
00:06:08.285,00:06:10.578,"AND, BEING A COP, HE COULDN'T AFFORD TO BE SLOW."
00:06:10.578,00:06:15.167,"OTHERWISE, HE'D MAKE A MISTAKE, OR PEOPLE WOULD SUFFER."
00:06:19.378,00:06:23.842,"I MEAN, THE FACT HE WAS A COP JUST MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HELP."
00:06:23.842,00:06:27.428,AND CALLING THEM WAS ONLY GONNA MAKE HIM COME DOWN HARDER ON HER LATER.
00:06:30.682,00:06:32.351,IT WAS NORMAL.
00:06:42.777,00:06:46.405,SO I WALKED INTO HIS BEDROOM...
00:06:47.532,00:06:49.368,...GOT HIS GUN...
00:06:51.161,00:07:01.462,...AND THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER IS THE GUN IN MY HAND -- IT WAS STILL HOT -- AND DAD ON THE FLOOR.
00:07:11.806,00:07:13.058,I WAS SO RELIEVED.
00:07:14.768,00:07:18.605,BUT THINGS ARE BETTER NOW...
00:07:18.605,00:07:21.983,"RYAN, PLEASE DON'T SAY -- I'M GLAD I SHOT HIM."
00:07:26.363,00:07:28.573,Annalise: WE'RE NOT JUST FIGHTING A MURDER CHARGE.
00:07:28.573,00:07:30.450,WE'RE FIGHTING THE POLICE.
00:07:41.502,00:07:43.797,"SO, HOW DO WE WIN THIS?"
00:07:49.052,00:07:53.598,"IN EMOTIONALLY DRIVEN CASES, JURY SELECTION ISN'T A SCIENCE."
00:07:53.598,00:07:55.850,IT'S THE ART OF HUMAN STUDY.
00:07:55.850,00:08:00.939,SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF BIAS WHEN PICKING A JUROR?
00:08:00.939,00:08:02.565,MISS PRATT.
00:08:02.565,00:08:04.443,BY MAKING SURE THE BIAS SWINGS IN YOUR FAVOR.
00:08:04.443,00:08:08.947,"FOR EXAMPLE, MEN TEND TO BE PUNISHMENT-ORIENTED AND FAVOR THE PROSECUTION."
00:08:08.947,00:08:11.199,WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD IN THE MEDIA ABOUT MY CLIENT?
00:08:11.199,00:08:14.661,THE SHORT VERSION?
00:08:14.661,00:08:17.664,I'D LIKE TO CHALLENGE JUROR 505 FOR CAUSE.
00:08:17.664,00:08:19.374,JUROR DISMISSED.
00:08:19.374,00:08:21.793,"BEYOND GENDER, WHAT ELSE DO WE LOOK FOR DURING VOIR DIRE?"
00:08:21.793,00:08:23.586,MR. GIBBINS.
00:08:23.586,00:08:29.676,SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE JUROR AND YOUR CLIENT -- ANY PERSONAL CONNECTIONS THAT WILL HELP THE JUROR SYMPATHIZE.
00:08:29.676,00:08:31.511,ARE YOU MARRIED?
00:08:31.511,00:08:33.554,HAPPILY?
00:08:33.554,00:08:35.182,"OH, LORD, YES."
00:08:35.182,00:08:37.142,THE DEFENSE ACCEPTS THIS JUROR.
00:08:37.142,00:08:44.649,"WHEN POLICE TESTIMONY IS PIVOTAL TO THE PROSECUTION'S CASE, WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR JURORS WHO ARE PRONE TO DISTRUST AUTHORITY."
00:08:44.649,00:08:47.527,WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SIGNIFIERS OF THIS?
00:08:48.569,00:08:50.322,NUMBER ONE IS RACE.
00:08:50.322,00:08:53.074,THERE'S A LARGER DISTRUST OF POLICE AMONG BLACK AMERICANS.
00:08:53.074,00:08:55.035,YOU DON'T CALL THE POLICE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.
00:08:55.035,00:08:57.245,EXCUSE.
00:08:57.245,00:09:01.082,EVERY JUROR YOU LET IN THAT BOX CAN DECIDE YOUR CLIENT'S FATE.
00:09:01.082,00:09:05.504,"SOME COPS ARE BAD, SOME ARE GOOD -- LIKE ALL PEOPLE."
00:09:05.504,00:09:10.842,THAT EPISODE OF NYPD BLUE WHERE DETECTIVE SIMONE DIED STILL MAKES ME TEAR UP.
00:09:10.842,00:09:12.427,EXCUSE.
00:09:12.427,00:09:15.430,GRACE KELLY AND I HAVE TEA TOGETHER QUITE OFTEN.
00:09:15.430,00:09:17.307,Judge: DISMISSED FOR CAUSE.
00:09:17.307,00:09:18.350,"ACCEPT, YOUR HONOR."
00:09:18.350,00:09:19.267,EXCUSE.

00:09:23.480,00:09:25.315,"EXCUSE, YOUR HONOR."
00:09:25.315,00:09:30.778,12 COMPLETE STRANGERS WILL MAKE OR BREAK YOUR CASE BEFORE YOU'VE SAID ONE WORD OF YOUR OPENING STATEMENT.
00:09:30.778,00:09:38.161,"I DIRECT YOU NOT TO DISCUSS THE CASE WITH ANYONE, FORM AN OPINION, OR SEARCH OUT ANY MEDIA COVERAGE OF THIS MATTER."
00:09:38.161,00:09:40.080,REPORT BACK AT 9:00 A.M. TOMORROW.
00:09:44.292,00:09:46.044,Wes: YOU'RE MAKING A SCORECARD?
00:09:46.044,00:09:49.756,WE FINALLY HAVE A CLIENT I DON'T HATE.
00:09:49.756,00:09:50.924,Asher: REALLY?
00:09:50.924,00:09:52.759,THE GUY WHO SHOT HIS DAD IN THE BACK?
00:09:52.759,00:09:57.055,"YOUR HONOR, I'D LIKE TO FILE A MOTION TO EXCLUDE TESTIMONY OF THE ALLEGED ABUSE OF SHARON REMINI."
00:09:57.055,00:09:59.807,"YOUR HONOR, THE PROSECUTION HAS HAD WEEKS TO FILE THIS MOTION."
00:09:59.807,00:10:02.643,SHE DELIBERATELY WAITED UNTIL AFTER VOIR DIRE TO UNDERMINE MY DEFENSE.
00:10:07.107,00:10:09.817,THE TESTIMONY OF THE WOMAN WHO HAS SUFFERED THE ABUSE FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS.
00:10:09.817,00:10:12.529,MRS. REMINI IS HERE RIGHT NOW.
00:10:12.529,00:10:18.285,SHARON REMINI IS THE DEFENDANT'S MOTHER AND HAS EVERY REASON TO FABRICATE ABUSE CLAIMS IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO SAVE HER SON.
00:10:18.285,00:10:20.828,"IN FACT, MRS. REMINI NEVER ONCE FILED A REPORT WITH THE POLICE."
00:10:20.828,00:10:25.125,"HOW COULD SHE, WHEN THE PEOPLE THAT SHE'D CALL FOR HELP ARE THE DRINKING BUDDIES OF THE ABUSER?!"
00:10:25.125,00:10:27.710,"SO, YOU'RE ADMITTING YOU HAVE NO ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF THE ABUSE?"
00:10:27.710,00:10:33.674,"I HAVE THE TESTIMONY OF MY CLIENT, THE ONLINE DIARY HE'S KEPT FOR THREE YEARS THAT DOCUMENTS THE ABUSE."
00:10:33.674,00:10:35.469,IT'S SELF-SERVING HEARSAY.
00:10:35.469,00:10:43.810,"I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THE PROSECUTION'S MOTION AND BLOCK ANY TESTIMONY OF ABUSE, EITHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, FROM THE DEFENDANT OR HIS MOTHER."
00:10:43.810,00:10:46.563,"YOUR HONOR -- MY HANDS ARE TIED, MS. KEATING."
00:10:58.366,00:11:00.994,WANT TO GRAB A BITE?
00:11:00.994,00:11:02.787,I KNOW A GREAT HOAGIE PLACE DOWN THE STREET.
00:11:02.787,00:11:04.623,YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT A SANDWICH?
00:11:04.623,00:11:06.749,OUR WHOLE CASE JUST GOT THROWN OUT.
00:11:06.749,00:11:16.343,"RYAN'S GOING TO PRISON FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE, WHERE HE WILL PROBABLY BECOME SOMEBODY'S BITCH BOY, AND THAT'S ACTUALLY THE GOOD OPTION, CONSIDERING HIS DAD'S COP BUDDIES MIGHT BEAT HIM TO DEATH FIRST."
00:11:18.719,00:11:23.183,"OH, RYAN. I DIDN'T -- NO, IT'S, UH..."
00:11:23.183,00:11:25.684,JUST...DON'T TELL MY MOM.
00:11:25.684,00:11:27.479,SHE STILL THINKS THERE'S HOPE.
00:11:31.816,00:11:33.776,RELAX.
00:11:33.776,00:11:36.196,UNLESS HE GOES HOME AND SHOOTS HIMSELF.
00:11:36.196,00:11:45.580,"Bonnie: IN CASES WHERE EMOTION IS CURRENCY, WE HAVE TO CATER OUR DEFENSE TO THE JURY, WHICH MEANS KNOWING THE JURY -- LEARNING TO READ REACTIONS, BODY LANGUAGE."
00:11:45.580,00:11:49.334,I'M ASSIGNING EACH OF YOU YOUR OWN PET JURORS TO WATCH.
00:11:49.334,00:11:51.919,LUMBERJACK? I DON'T -- I DON'T WANT THIS GUY.
00:11:51.919,00:11:54.339,"OH, NOT YOUR TYPE? I'LL TAKE HIM IF YOU GIVE ME SEXY LIBRARIAN."
00:11:54.339,00:11:57.258,HOW ABOUT THE TWO HAIRY GUYS?
00:11:59.344,00:12:01.095,"YES, BUT ABSOLUTELY NO CONTACT."
00:12:01.095,00:12:03.764,JURY TAMPERING IS ILLEGAL.
00:12:03.764,00:12:06.518,"THIS IS ALL FUN AND EVERYTHING, BUT WHAT'S OUR DEFENSE?"
00:12:06.518,00:12:09.103,WE PICKED A JURY BASED ON ARGUING ABUSE.
00:12:09.103,00:12:12.232,"IF RYAN WAS ON DRUGS, WE CAN ARGUE DIMINISHED CAPACITY."
00:12:14.401,00:12:17.778,I DON'T THINK SO.
00:12:14.401,00:12:20.657,"WE NEED A TROJAN HORSE TO ALLOW THE ABUSE IN, A BACK DOOR."
00:12:21.616,00:12:23.742,IT'S RYAN'S BLOG.
00:12:23.742,00:12:30.584,"IF WE COULD GET ONE OF THE PROSECUTION'S WITNESSES TO MENTION IT ON THE STAND, THEN EVERYTHING HE EVER WROTE CAN BE ALLOWED INTO EVIDENCE."
00:12:30.584,00:12:32.669,STAY UP ALL NIGHT.
00:12:32.669,00:12:35.422,KNOW THE BLOG INSIDE AND OUT BEFORE TOMORROW.

00:12:38.132,00:12:43.096,"Barker: AS RYAN'S ENGLISH TEACHER, DID YOU EVER SUSPECT HE HAD NEGATIVE FEELINGS TOWARD HIS FATHER?"
00:12:43.096,00:12:44.556,YES.
00:12:44.556,00:12:48.809,RYAN...
00:12:48.809,00:12:51.646,EVERYONE AT SCHOOL WAS AWARE HE HAD PROBLEMS WITH HIS FATHER.
00:12:53.189,00:12:55.609,HE PERFORMED A SONG AT THE TALENT SHOW ONCE.
00:12:55.609,00:12:57.068,THE LYRICS WERE...
00:12:57.068,00:12:58.986,CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE?
00:12:58.986,00:13:02.990,I'M GONNA PUT SOME HOT LEAD IN MY DADDY'S HEAD.
00:13:02.990,00:13:05.076,"NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR."
00:13:05.076,00:13:07.704,The talent show -- get the date.
00:13:07.704,00:13:10.749,You've got something?
00:13:10.749,00:13:12.709,Ask about the date.
00:13:12.709,00:13:16.129,THE TALENT SHOW THAT YOU JUST REFERENCED -- WHEN DID IT OCCUR?
00:13:16.129,00:13:17.589,"IT WAS THIS SPRING -- APRIL, I THINK."
00:13:17.589,00:13:19.674,SO APRIL 2014?
00:13:20.759,00:13:22.093,GOT IT.
00:13:24.638,00:13:30.851,"MRS. MEDICK, ARE THESE THE SAME LYRICS OF THE SONG THAT YOU JUST STATED FOR US?"
00:13:30.851,00:13:34.314,I'M JUST CORROBORATING THE FACTS PRESENTED BY THE PROSECUTION'S OWN WITNESS.
00:13:34.314,00:13:35.649,"OVERRULED, MS. BARKER."
00:13:35.649,00:13:36.815,SIT DOWN.
00:13:36.815,00:13:39.277,"YES, THEY'RE THE SAME LYRICS."
00:13:39.277,00:13:47.494,"YOUR HONOR, THESE LYRICS WERE FIRST PUBLISHED ON RYAN'S BLOG IN JANUARY 2014, THREE MONTHS PREVIOUS TO THE TALENT SHOW."
00:13:47.494,00:13:53.416,"THEREFORE, ALL ENTRIES ARE OPEN TO TESTIMONY, INCLUDING THE ENTRIES WHERE HE DESCRIBES HIS FATHER'S PHYSICAL ABUSE AGAINST HIS MOTHER."
00:13:53.416,00:13:55.042,OBJECTION!
00:13:53.416,00:13:58.921,YOUR HONOR ALREADY RULED -- THAT WAS BEFORE YOU WALKED THE ABUSE INTO THIS COURTROOM WITH YOUR OWN WITNESS.
00:13:58.921,00:14:00.839,"I NEED TO SEE THIS BLOG, MS. KEATING."
00:14:00.839,00:14:02.676,"OF COURSE, YOUR HONOR."
00:14:06.304,00:14:09.641,"I'LL ALLOW IT INTO EVIDENCE -- AND, THEREFORE, THE ABUSE."
00:14:09.641,00:14:13.102,"Barker: YOUR HONOR -- RULE NUMBER 106 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, MS. BARKER."
00:14:13.102,00:14:14.646,OVERRULED.
00:14:14.646,00:14:16.564,WELL DONE.
00:14:20.443,00:14:22.445,"Rebecca: YO, RUDY 2.0! OPEN UP!"
00:14:23.946,00:14:26.032,"OH, YES! KNEW IT."
00:14:26.032,00:14:28.159,I COULD SMELL THE PEPPERONI THROUGH THE WALL.
00:14:28.159,00:14:29.494,THERE'S NO FOOD IN MY PLACE.
00:14:29.494,00:14:33.914,"EVERY TIME I LEAVE THE HOUSE, SOMEBODY SCREAMS PSYCHO KILLER AT ME."
00:14:33.914,00:14:36.626,IT'S SO GOOD.
00:14:38.169,00:14:40.171,I'VE BEEN STARING AT THE WALL FOR LIKE THREE DAYS.
00:14:40.171,00:14:44.133,I NEED COMPANY.
00:14:44.133,00:14:47.387,ALTHOUGH SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU MIGHT BE INTO THAT.
00:14:49.263,00:14:52.099,"SO, UH..."
00:14:49.263,00:14:54.268,ABOUT THE PHONE -- ANNALISE DOESN'T WANT TO USE IT YET -- I KNOW.
00:14:54.268,00:14:55.812,YOU TALKED TO HER?
00:14:55.812,00:15:00.525,"YEAH, SHE CALLED ME THIS MORNING, WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WAS OKAY -- WHICH IS MORE THAN CAN BE SAID FOR YOU."
00:15:00.525,00:15:05.321,NO. I-I-I JUST DIDN'T THINK YOU'D WANT -- I'M KIDDING.
00:15:05.321,00:15:06.656,YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT PROFESSIONAL.
00:15:07.741,00:15:10.451,OR YOU THINK I DID IT.
00:15:12.912,00:15:15.289,LAWYERS DON'T ASK THEIR CLIENTS THAT.
00:15:15.289,00:15:18.251,"YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY, OF COURSE I DON'T THINK YOU DID IT."
00:15:18.251,00:15:20.461,GOD. WHAT KIND OF A TERRIBLE LAWYER ARE YOU?
00:15:20.461,00:15:27.427,"I'M NOT A LAWYER AT ALL, ACTUALLY -- SOMETHING YOU WERE VERY HAPPY TO TELL THOSE COPS IN JAIL, IF YOU REMEMBER."
00:15:27.427,00:15:29.888,"YEAH, WELL..."
00:15:29.888,00:15:31.806,YOU STILL DON'T.
00:15:31.806,00:15:33.266,I KNOW YOU'VE GOT ISSUES.
00:15:33.266,00:15:38.354,WHAT KIND OF A PERSON LIES HIS WAY INTO JAIL FOR HIS POTENTIALLY MURDEROUS NEIGHBOR?
00:15:42.400,00:15:45.194,I DIDN'T DO IT.
00:15:47.906,00:15:50.784,I JUST LIKE MAKING PEOPLE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.
00:15:50.784,00:15:54.120,"MAKES ME FEEL BETTER, FOR SOME REASON."
00:15:54.120,00:15:56.289,SO I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH ISSUES.
00:16:36.663,00:16:39.540,THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON WITH ME AND THAT GIRL.
00:16:42.502,00:16:45.505,I WAS AFRAID YOU'D THINK I HURT HER.
00:17:09.529,00:17:10.905,HI.
00:17:10.905,00:17:12.573,RIGHT.
00:17:12.573,00:17:14.325,THIS AGAIN.
00:17:14.325,00:17:16.661,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
00:17:16.661,00:17:17.787,I DON'T KNOW.
00:17:17.787,00:17:18.955,I...
00:17:18.955,00:17:21.624,I JUST...
00:17:21.624,00:17:23.751,I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU.
00:17:23.751,00:17:27.797,YOU'RE SERIOUSLY GONNA PRETEND LIKE YOU DIDN'T GET ME FIRED?
00:17:27.797,00:17:30.090,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
00:17:30.090,00:17:33.761,YOU TOLD MY BOSS ABOUT US -- THAT I WAS INVESTIGATING SAM.
00:17:33.761,00:17:36.931,NO. I WOULD -- I WOULD NEVER -- COME ON.
00:17:36.931,00:17:41.227,"NATE, PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME. I -- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU."
00:17:41.227,00:17:45.023,"TO BE HONEST, I DON'T EVEN CARE."
00:17:45.023,00:17:48.359,"YOU WANT TO SLEEP NEXT TO A KILLER, GO FOR IT."
00:17:49.736,00:17:52.989,"OH, THAT'S RIGHT."
00:17:52.989,00:17:55.616,SAM WASN'T AWAY AT YALE THE NIGHT LILA GOT KILLED.
00:17:55.616,00:18:00.371,"NOW, SEE, HE LEFT NEW HAVEN AND DROVE BACK HERE TO PHILLY."
00:18:03.123,00:18:05.292,YOU TWO HAVE A LOVELY NIGHT.
00:18:26.064,00:18:27.648,Connor: THAT FRANK AGAIN?
00:18:29.067,00:18:30.443,GUY'S WHIPPED.
00:18:30.443,00:18:32.194,YOU SHOULD ANSWER.
00:18:32.194,00:18:34.655,HE'S THE LAST PERSON I WANT TO TALK TO RIGHT NOW.
00:18:34.655,00:18:36.532,"IT STRENGTHENS OUR ALIBI, MORON."
00:18:36.532,00:18:38.325,HE'LL HEAR THE BONFIRE IN THE BACKGROUND.
00:18:38.325,00:18:39.827,SHE'S RIGHT.
00:18:43.957,00:18:46.084,WHAT?
00:18:46.084,00:18:47.251,WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?
00:18:47.251,00:18:49.420,THE BONFIRE.
00:18:49.420,00:18:50.463,"Laurel, wait."
00:18:50.463,00:18:51.505,LET ME EXPLAIN.
00:18:51.505,00:18:58.930,"EXPLAIN WHAT, HOW YOU LIED TO ME JUST SO THAT YOU COULD SCREW ME, ADD ME TO YOUR LIST OF STUDENT CONQUESTS?"
00:18:58.930,00:19:01.307,I KNOW THAT -- REAL BAD.
00:19:01.307,00:19:04.560,I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO MAKE THIS RIGHT -- ANYTHING.
00:19:04.560,00:19:06.312,JUST -- JUST DON'T SHUT ME OUT LIKE THIS.
00:19:06.312,00:19:08.064,I CAN'T JUST...
00:19:10.566,00:19:13.820,I'LL DO ANYTHING.
00:19:16.030,00:19:18.365,IT'S TOO LATE.
00:19:21.535,00:19:23.955,WE JUST NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE JURORS.
00:19:23.955,00:19:29.043,"THAT WAY, WE CAN ARGUE A DEFENSE THAT SPEAKS TO THEM PERSONALLY AND WILL MAKE THEM ACQUIT RYAN."
00:19:29.043,00:19:33.213,"AND YOU THINK THEY SHOULD, EVEN THOUGH THERE WASN'T ANY IMMINENT THREAT TO HIS MOTHER'S LIFE IN THAT MOMENT?"
00:19:33.213,00:19:35.174,EXCUSE ME.
00:19:35.174,00:19:37.384,"ONE WRONG PUNCH, AND SHE COULD'VE ENDED UP DEAD."
00:19:37.384,00:19:39.971,WHICH IS NOT A LEGAL ARGUMENT YOU CAN USE IN COURT.
00:19:39.971,00:19:43.766,"I CAME HERE FOR YOU TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER, NOT WORSE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
00:19:43.766,00:19:52.150,"LOOK, THIS CASE IS ABOUT EMOTION, WHICH MEANS THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU WIN THIS IS IF YOU GET THE JURY TO REJECT THE LAW AND ACQUIT REGARDLESS OF THE EVIDENCE."
00:19:57.989,00:20:00.158,IT'S NOT ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO DO IT.
00:20:00.158,00:20:02.576,"WHAT, SO YOU THINK I SHOULD TELL THEM?"
00:20:02.576,00:20:05.997,WHAT WOULD ANNALISE KEATING DO?
00:20:07.874,00:20:10.960,"NO, NO, YOU SHOULD NOT -- YOU SHOULD NOT TELL THEM."
00:20:10.960,00:20:16.507,"'CAUSE IF YOU DO, YOU GO TO JAIL, AND THAT IS NOT COOL WITH ME."
00:20:21.428,00:20:22.889,MY BAD.
00:20:24.431,00:20:26.017,Bonnie: YOU NEED ME?
00:20:27.351,00:20:30.354,YES.
00:20:40.322,00:20:44.368,"IF THIS IS ABOUT THE FIGHT YOU AND SAM HAD THE OTHER NIGHT, WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT."
00:20:44.368,00:20:45.870,THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
00:20:51.709,00:20:54.670,I KNOW HOW YOU GOT REBECCA'S CONFESSION TAPE.
00:20:56.172,00:20:59.800,DETECTIVE LAHEY ILLEGALLY SEARCHED THROUGH MR. KEATING'S CAR LAST NIGHT.
00:20:59.800,00:21:01.969,THE CONFESSION TAPE -- NOW.
00:21:01.969,00:21:10.436,I DIDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE -- WHY? BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'D NEVER LET YOU AIR MY DIRTY LAUNDRY TO THE POLICE?
00:21:10.436,00:21:12.354,I THOUGHT YOU HAD ENOUGH ON YOUR PLATE.
00:21:12.354,00:21:19.570,"DON'T YOU DARE SAY THAT YOU WERE DOING THIS FOR ME, 'CAUSE WE BOTH KNOW WHAT PERSON IN THIS HOUSE YOU DID IT FOR, AND IT WASN'T ME."
00:21:24.200,00:21:27.161,I'M SORRY.
00:21:27.161,00:21:28.996,I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU.
00:21:28.996,00:21:31.540,YES.
00:21:31.540,00:21:34.668,"BUT THANK YOU FOR PROTECTING MY HUSBAND, THOUGH."
00:21:39.298,00:21:40.591,NOW GO.
00:21:44.595,00:21:46.513,Miller: I ALWAYS LIKED SHARON.
00:21:46.513,00:21:51.560,IT'S JUST THAT IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE WHAT SHE'S CLAIMING ABOUT ANTHONY.
00:21:51.560,00:21:53.479,I WORKED BY HIS SIDE FOR EIGHT YEARS.
00:21:53.479,00:21:56.065,THAT'S JUST NOT THE GUY I KNEW.
00:21:56.065,00:21:59.610,"Barker: TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, WERE THERE EVER ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT HIS SERVICE?"
00:21:59.610,00:22:01.237,HE PRIDED HIMSELF ON BEING BY THE BOOK.
00:22:01.237,00:22:03.197,Are you seriously looking for sex right now?
00:22:03.197,00:22:05.365,WE MADE FUN OF HIM FOR IT.
00:22:05.365,00:22:08.911,Barker: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT OFFICER REMINI COULD EVER HAVE HARMED HIS WIFE?
00:22:08.911,00:22:11.497,"NO. THE OPPOSITE, REALLY."
00:22:11.497,00:22:13.082,HE WAS VERY PROTECTIVE OF SHARON.
00:22:13.082,00:22:15.001,SHE WAS...FRAGILE.
00:22:15.001,00:22:18.504,"HE CALLED HER EVERY DAY, SEVERAL TIMES, JUST TO CHECK UP ON HER."
00:22:23.717,00:22:26.220,DOES ANYONE ELSE THINK THAT SEXY LIBRARIAN'S A LESBIAN?
00:22:26.220,00:22:28.597,"I MEAN, SHE JUST STARES AT ANNALISE'S BOOBS ALL THE TIME."
00:22:28.597,00:22:30.432,THEY ARE GREAT BOOBS.
00:22:31.642,00:22:33.602,"CAN WE ALL FOCUS, PLEASE?"
00:22:33.602,00:22:37.898,"OKAY, LOOK, YOUR EMOTIONAL SCORECARD IS CUTE AND POINTLESS, LIKE A DUMB BLONDE."
00:22:37.898,00:22:40.067,THEY NEED TO VOTE ON EVIDENCE.
00:22:40.067,00:22:42.778,"YEAH, AND MY STUDY GROUP NEEDS THIS OUTLINE BY 8:00 A.M."
00:22:42.778,00:22:48.659,"HONESTLY, I'VE GOT LIKE SIX GUYS ON MY JOCK, SO I KIND OF NEED TO FOCUS."
00:22:48.659,00:22:50.577,ARE THERE APPS LIKE THAT FOR STRAIGHT PEOPLE?
00:22:50.577,00:22:52.788,"WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE HACKER, ANYWAY?"
00:22:52.788,00:22:54.581,HE FINALLY GET SICK OF YOU USING HIM?
00:22:54.581,00:22:59.545,"AW, YOU THINK THAT WE'RE FRIENDS, THAT WE'LL CHAT ABOUT OUR BOY PROBLEMS?"
00:22:59.545,00:23:03.090,THE ONLY ONE WITH BOY PROBLEMS HERE IS YOU.
00:23:03.090,00:23:05.051,OH.
00:23:07.469,00:23:10.514,"IT'S ILLEGAL, AND IF WE GOT CAUGHT, ANNALISE GETS DISBARRED."
00:23:10.514,00:23:13.351,"YOU KNOW THIS FAMILY, FRANK."
00:23:13.351,00:23:14.643,WE NEED TO HELP THEM.
00:23:14.643,00:23:16.979,"I KNOW THAT, AND WE ARE."
00:23:16.979,00:23:19.815,"WHY THE HELL ARE YOU SO WORKED UP ABOUT THIS CASE, ANYWAY?"
00:23:19.815,00:23:21.650,UNLESS YOUR FATHER BEAT YOU.
00:23:21.650,00:23:23.694,"MY FATHER DID NOT BEAT ME, OKAY?"
00:23:23.694,00:23:25.529,I JUST...
00:23:25.529,00:23:27.656,I WANT TO FEEL LIKE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING GOOD FOR ONCE.
00:23:27.656,00:23:30.159,WHY IS THAT SO HARD FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND?
00:23:31.244,00:23:33.453,IT'S NOT.
00:23:34.538,00:23:35.622,"Connor: OH, MY GOD."
00:23:35.622,00:23:37.291,WHAT?
00:23:37.291,00:23:39.793,LUMBERJACK JUST MESSAGED ME.
00:23:39.793,00:23:42.713,THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING ON YOUR GAY-SEX APP?
00:23:42.713,00:23:47.218,"I'VE BEEN STALKING HIM ON HumpR, WAITING FOR HIM TO OUT HIMSELF."
00:23:47.218,00:23:50.763,AND HE FINALLY BIT.
00:23:50.763,00:23:57.228,"Judge Lee: ALL COP KILLERS DESERVE TO FRY, ESPECIALLY LITTLE BITCHES WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPECT THEIR DADDY."
00:23:57.228,00:24:01.607,DID YOU WRITE THAT MESSAGE TO A GENTLEMAN CALLED EightIsGreat ON THIS DATING APP?
00:24:01.607,00:24:03.276,What's your screen name mean?
00:24:03.276,00:24:05.111,I can show you.
00:24:03.276,00:24:07.445,EVEN AFTER I SPECIFICALLY FORBID ANY TALK ABOUT THE CASE OUTSIDE THIS COURT?
00:24:07.445,00:24:10.116,I DID.
00:24:10.116,00:24:12.743,YOU HAVE PROVEN BIAS AGAINST THE DEFENDANT.
00:24:12.743,00:24:15.495,"YOU ARE DISMISSED, FACING POSSIBLE PENALTIES."
00:24:15.495,00:24:20.960,"ALTERNATE JUROR NUMBER ONE, YOU ARE CALLED UPON TO FILL THE VACANCY."
00:24:20.960,00:24:24.797,SEE? SEXTING PAYS OFF.
00:24:24.797,00:24:26.715,WHAT'S YOUR SCORECARD SAY?
00:24:26.715,00:24:29.593,"UH, AT BEST, WE HAVE HALF OF THEM."
00:24:29.593,00:24:34.223,"OKAY, SO MAYBE THERE'S A RAT'S ASS OF A CHANCE WE PULL THIS OFF."
00:24:35.724,00:24:38.060,"Sharon: I'M STUPID, WORTHLESS."
00:24:38.060,00:24:42.273,EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF MY MOUTH IS A LIE.
00:24:42.273,00:24:50.739,"THAT'S WHAT ANTHONY WOULD SAY WHEN HE'D ACCUSE ME OF SLEEPING WITH A CUSTOMER, MY BOSS, A BAG BOY."
00:24:50.739,00:24:52.658,AND THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
00:24:54.243,00:24:56.329,HE'D...BEAT ME.
00:24:56.329,00:24:58.705,"SLAP ME, PUNCH ME."
00:24:58.705,00:25:08.215,"UH, ONE TIME, I CAME HOME A LITTLE LATE 'CAUSE I WAS COVERING FOR THIS PREGNANT GIRL I WORK WITH."
00:25:08.215,00:25:18.184,"HE KICKED ME IN THE STOMACH, SAID HE'D AT LEAST MAKE SURE I'D NEVER BE ABLE TO HAVE A BABY AGAIN."
00:25:18.184,00:25:20.560,DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT LEAVING HIM OR PRESSING CHARGES?
00:25:20.560,00:25:22.688,Preggers felt that in the baby maker.
00:25:22.688,00:25:25.316,HE SAID HE'D KILL ME IF I DID.
00:25:25.316,00:25:34.283,"HE SAID HE'D GET AWAY WITH IT 'CAUSE HE WAS A POLICEMAN, AND NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE IT IF HE KILLED HIS WIFE."
00:25:34.283,00:25:37.953,HE TOLD ME NO ONE WOULD PROTECT ME.
00:25:37.953,00:25:40.039,BUT SOMEONE DID.
00:25:40.039,00:25:51.549,"MY SON SAVED MY LIFE, AND YOU ALL KEEP SAYING HE'S EVIL, ALL BECAUSE HE HAD THE COURAGE TO BE THE MAN MY HUSBAND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE."
00:25:59.557,00:26:01.310,"THANK YOU, MRS. REMINI."
00:26:01.310,00:26:02.936,"Come on, let it rain, hairy guy."
00:26:02.936,00:26:04.688,Let it rain.
00:26:09.235,00:26:11.111,"UM, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"
00:26:11.111,00:26:15.449,WOULD YOU BE DEAD RIGHT NOW IF RYAN HADN'T KILLED YOUR HUSBAND?
00:26:15.449,00:26:18.576,"DID HE HAVE HIS GUN AIMED AT YOUR HEAD, FOR EXAMPLE?"
00:26:18.576,00:26:20.954,NO.
00:26:20.954,00:26:25.459,"BECAUSE YOUR SON, RYAN, WAS HOLDING YOUR HUSBAND'S SERVICE REVOLVER IN HIS HAND."
00:26:25.459,00:26:29.796,"HE POINTED IT AT YOUR UNARMED HUSBAND'S BACK, AND HE FIRED A SHOT THAT KILLED HIM."
00:26:29.796,00:26:31.673,ISN'T THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
00:26:31.673,00:26:35.677,"YES, BUT HE -- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS."
00:26:46.355,00:26:48.690,MY ENGAGEMENT RING IS GONE!
00:26:50.568,00:26:52.445,"MICHAELA, IT'S GONNA BE LIGHT SOON."
00:26:52.445,00:26:56.574,WE STILL NEED TO GET RID OF THE BAGS AND -- UNTIL WE FIND IT.
00:26:59.452,00:27:03.038,"I ALREADY TOLD YOU, YES!"
00:27:03.038,00:27:05.874,"OH, MY GOD, WHAT IF WE DON'T FIND IT?"
00:27:05.874,00:27:08.626,I GUESS YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO CANCEL THE WEDDING.
00:27:08.626,00:27:11.464,WE STILL NEED HER TO RETURN THE TROPHY TO ASHER'S.
00:27:11.464,00:27:12.590,THERE'S NO WAY SHE CAN DO THAT.
00:27:12.590,00:27:14.508,LOOK AT HER.
00:27:14.508,00:27:16.302,"OH, NO. NO, NO, NO."
00:27:16.302,00:27:18.929,WE ALL HAD TO DO THINGS TONIGHT THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO.
00:27:18.929,00:27:21.807,THIS ONE IS ON HER.
00:27:23.267,00:27:24.602,I'LL DO IT.
00:27:26.019,00:27:28.397,AND HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?
00:27:33.486,00:27:41.577,"Annalise: THERE ARE CASES THAT SPEAK TO EVIDENCE, AND THEN THERE ARE CASES THAT SPEAK TO OUR HUMANITY, BEGGING OUR HEARTS TO DECIDE."
00:27:41.577,00:27:47.500,WHAT IS RIGHT IS WHAT YOU FEEL AND WHAT YOU KNOW IN YOUR BONES.
00:27:47.500,00:27:54.881,"DISCOVERING WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS OF A MARRIAGE OR FAMILY IS SHOCKING, WHICH IS WHY THIS CASE..."
00:27:54.881,00:27:56.967,IS NOT ABOUT THE SECRETS OF A MARRIAGE.
00:27:56.967,00:27:59.886,THIS CASE IS ABOUT THE LAW.
00:27:59.886,00:28:03.932,RYAN REMINI PROTECTED HIS MOTHER WHEN NO ONE ELSE WOULD.
00:28:03.932,00:28:08.521,"IN THAT MOMENT, HE HAD TO ACT, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES."
00:28:08.521,00:28:13.066,THERE WAS NO IMMINENT THREAT TO SHARON REMINI THE NIGHT RYAN SHOT HIS FATHER.
00:28:13.066,00:28:17.321,"FOR YEARS, HE TURNED AWAY, HUNG HIS HEAD IN SHAME WHENEVER HE HEARD HIS MOTHER'S CRIES..."
00:28:17.321,00:28:19.031,THE LAW IS CLEAR.
00:28:19.031,00:28:22.535,THE POWER OF JUDGMENT DOES NOT LIE IN THE HANDS OF A 17-YEAR-OLD BOY.
00:28:22.535,00:28:30.876,"...AS SHE WAS BEAT, SLAPPED, KICKED BY ANTHONY REMINI, A MAN WHO TORTURED HIS WIFE AND TERRIFIED HIS SON."
00:28:30.876,00:28:32.836,A POLICE OFFICER SWORN TO PROTECT HIS COMMUNITY.
00:28:32.836,00:28:38.758,Annalise: DON'T SEND THIS YOUNG MAN TO PRISON FOR DOING THE SAME THING YOU WOULD HAVE DONE FOR SOMEONE YOU LOVED.
00:28:38.758,00:28:43.972,"YOU WOULD PROTECT THEM, AND THAT IS NOT A CRIME."
00:28:44.973,00:28:47.267,DON'T MAKE IT ONE.
00:28:49.478,00:28:51.230,WES: What's the tally?
00:28:51.230,00:28:55.275,"Optimistically, we have nine."
00:28:55.275,00:28:58.445,"SO, A HUNG JURY AT BEST AND A CONVICTION NEXT TRIAL."
00:28:58.445,00:29:01.281,TOLD YOU.
00:29:09.456,00:29:12.585,"IT'S LATE, AND YOUR JURY IS OUT DELIBERATING."
00:29:12.585,00:29:14.712,"COME ON, LET'S, UH -- LET'S GET A BEER."
00:29:14.712,00:29:19.425,"I HAVE A BUNCH OF OTHER WORK TO DO, BUT I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I LEAVE."
00:30:07.306,00:30:09.433,WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?
00:30:09.433,00:30:11.893,YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW.
00:30:14.313,00:30:15.855,YOU IDIOT.
00:30:15.855,00:30:17.691,I HAVE TO TELL ANNALISE.
00:30:17.691,00:30:20.653,FINE. GO AHEAD.
00:30:20.653,00:30:22.321,TELL HER I WAS SHOWING OFF.
00:30:26.700,00:30:28.661,Annalise: WHICH ONE WAS IT?
00:30:28.661,00:30:31.079,NOT SURE.
00:30:31.079,00:30:35.167,I JUST KNOW SOMEONE LET A JUROR KNOW ABOUT NULLIFICATION.
00:30:35.167,00:30:38.462,JUST SAY YOU KNOW BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ME.
00:30:38.462,00:30:41.423,"BUT DON'T LIE TO ME, FRANK."
00:30:41.423,00:30:43.049,"IF ONE MORE MAN LIES TO ME, I SWEAR TO GOD..."
00:30:43.049,00:30:45.302,"ANNALISE, I'M NOT AN OFFICER OF THE COURT."
00:30:45.302,00:30:48.347,WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPORT.
00:30:50.056,00:30:53.143,NO.
00:30:53.143,00:30:57.230,THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO -- REPORT IT TO THE D.A.
00:30:57.230,00:31:00.275,WHAT?
00:31:10.536,00:31:15.374,Barker: WE RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS TIP THAT SOMEONE INFORMED THE JURY AS TO HOW NULLIFICATION WORKS.
00:31:15.374,00:31:17.042,"CLEARLY, IT WAS A MEMBER OF THE DEFENSE TEAM."
00:31:17.042,00:31:18.377,"BASED ON WHAT EVIDENCE, YOUR HONOR?"
00:31:18.377,00:31:19.503,WE ALL KNOW WHO BENEFITS FROM THIS ACT.
00:31:19.503,00:31:21.380,"AGAIN, WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE?"
00:31:21.380,00:31:24.007,STOP.
00:31:25.425,00:31:32.891,"HAS ANYONE SPOKEN WITH OR CONTACTED ANY OF YOU ABOUT THIS CASE IN ANY WAY, INCLUDING A DISCUSSION OF THE CONCEPT OF JURY NULLIFICATION?"
00:31:37.896,00:31:39.439,"IT WAS ME, YOUR HONOR."
00:31:39.439,00:31:43.694,I FOUND INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO VOTE OUR HEARTS.
00:31:43.694,00:31:45.654,I SHARED IT WITH THE REST OF THE JURY.
00:31:48.907,00:31:56.582,"IN THE CASE K7439080, I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DECLARE A MISTRIAL."
00:31:56.582,00:31:58.417,JURY IS DISCHARGED.
00:32:12.931,00:32:15.308,WHAT?
00:32:15.308,00:32:20.439,"WELL, IT SEEMS WE'VE DONE IRREPARABLE HARM TO THE PUBLIC OPINION OF RYAN."
00:32:20.439,00:32:25.402,"DUE TO THE ABUSE DEFENSE, THE D.A. NO LONGER THINKS HE'S A SOCIOPATH."
00:32:25.402,00:32:28.154,"THEREFORE, THEY'VE BUMPED THE CHARGE TO JUVENILE COURT."
00:32:28.154,00:32:31.658,"YOU'RE LOOKING AT PROBATION, COMMUNITY SERVICE, AND COUNSELING."
00:32:31.658,00:32:33.493,DID YOU HEAR THAT?
00:32:33.493,00:32:34.536,YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
00:32:36.455,00:32:38.540,"I MEAN, IS THIS HAPPENING?"
00:32:38.540,00:32:39.583,IT'S HAPPENING.
00:32:40.918,00:32:42.127,THANK YOU.
00:32:42.127,00:32:43.211,THANK YOU.
00:32:45.672,00:32:47.966,"OH, MY GOD."
00:32:47.966,00:32:50.844,ALLERGIES.
00:33:11.615,00:33:13.659,HEY.
00:33:13.659,00:33:15.494,HI.
00:33:20.916,00:33:23.669,YOU WON YOUR CASE?
00:33:23.669,00:33:26.045,WERE YOU AT YALE WHEN LILA WHEN MURDERED?
00:33:33.762,00:33:34.972,NO.
00:33:38.224,00:33:45.524,SHE WAS UPSET WHEN SHE CALLED ME -- SAID SHE WAS GONNA DO SOMETHING TO HURT HERSELF.
00:33:47.567,00:33:52.155,"SO I SKIPPED MY LECTURE, CAME BACK TO SEE HER, BUT I COULDN'T FIND HER."
00:33:52.155,00:33:54.533,SHE STOPPED ANSWERING HER PHONE.
00:33:54.533,00:33:57.118,SO I DROVE BACK TO NEW HAVEN.
00:33:57.118,00:33:59.496,I WAS BACK IN MY HOTEL BY MORNING.
00:33:59.496,00:34:04.668,SO YOU WERE HERE IN PHILADELPHIA AT THE EXACT SAME TIME SHE WAS BEING KILLED.
00:34:04.668,00:34:06.837,ANNALISE -- I KNOW.
00:34:06.837,00:34:08.213,YOU DIDN'T DO IT.
00:34:12.300,00:34:14.594,I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY HERE.
00:34:17.973,00:34:20.099,I'M SORRY I SLEPT WITH HER.
00:34:20.099,00:34:23.854,I'M SORRY I LIED ABOUT IT.
00:34:25.397,00:34:27.900,BUT I DIDN'T KILL HER.
00:34:30.151,00:34:31.653,REBECCA SUTTER'S ON HER WAY OVER.
00:34:31.653,00:34:34.406,YOU'RE GONNA DO A PSYCH EVALUATION ON HER.
00:34:34.406,00:34:37.200,WHAT?
00:34:37.200,00:34:46.668,WHATEVER IT TAKES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT LILA TOLD HER ABOUT YOU OR IF SHE SHARED ANY PICTURES OF YOU-- OF YOUR FACE.
00:34:46.668,00:34:49.421,"ANNIE, THIS -- THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA."
00:34:51.048,00:34:52.632,GAME FACE ON.
00:35:01.140,00:35:04.561,"REBECCA, THIS IS MY HUSBAND, SAM."
00:35:04.561,00:35:07.647,HE'S GONNA BE HELPING US OUT TONIGHT.
00:35:07.647,00:35:11.902,HI.
00:35:11.902,00:35:13.987,CAN WE GET THIS OVER WITH?
00:35:15.739,00:35:19.534,"SO, WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS DEPRESSED?"
00:35:19.534,00:35:22.079,DO YOU EVER WORRY THAT YOU MIGHT HARM YOURSELF?
00:35:22.079,00:35:26.875,"I HAVE A HIGH I.Q., A WIDE RANGE OF GENERALIZED NEUROSES, AND A SLIGHT TENDENCY TOWARDS PARANOIA."
00:35:26.875,00:35:29.586,YOU'VE BEEN EVALUATED BEFORE.
00:35:29.586,00:35:32.547,JUVIE.
00:35:32.547,00:35:35.675,"NO, NO."
00:35:35.675,00:35:38.219,IT JUST HELPS PRESENT YOU AS A CREDIBLE WITNESS.
00:35:40.764,00:35:45.018,"ALL RIGHT, REBECCA, LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT HOW YOU KNEW HER."
00:35:45.018,00:35:46.937,WE MET AT THE BAR.
00:35:46.937,00:35:51.650,"SHE WAS A SPOILED SORORITY GIRL WHO WANTED A THRILL, SO SHE ASKED IF SHE COULD HELP ME DEAL."
00:35:51.650,00:35:53.401,WHO WAS SHE SELLING TO?
00:35:53.401,00:35:56.989,"OTHER STUDENTS, MOSTLY GIRLS AT KAPPA KAPPA BITCH."
00:35:56.989,00:35:59.198,"SO, HOW DID YOU END UP WITH HER PHONE?"
00:36:00.659,00:36:04.370,SHE LEFT IT AT MY APARTMENT THE NIGHT BEFORE.
00:36:04.370,00:36:07.582,SAID SHE WAS DONE DEALING.
00:36:12.170,00:36:15.007,JUST THAT HE WAS MARRIED.
00:36:15.007,00:36:19.970,SHE THOUGHT IT MADE HER SOUND SMART AND NOT LIKE EVERY OTHER DUMB GIRL OBSESSED WITH JANE AUSTEN.
00:36:19.970,00:36:26.559,AND IS THERE ANY REASON YOU THINK THAT MR. DARCY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HER DEATH?
00:36:26.559,00:36:30.814,"HE WAS SOME SAD OLD MAN, BORED WITH HIS MARRIAGE, EXCITED TO BE DOING A HOT, YOUNG PIECE OF ASS."
00:36:30.814,00:36:34.693,"SHE PROBABLY GOT SICK OF IT AND BROKE IT OFF, SO HE KILLED HER."
00:36:36.778,00:36:38.655,DO YOU HAVE PROOF OF THAT?
00:36:38.655,00:36:43.493,"OR COULD THAT BE, AS YOU SAID, YOUR SLIGHT TENDENCY TOWARDS PARANOIA?"
00:36:45.453,00:36:48.247,THERE'S A PENIS PIC.
00:36:49.791,00:36:51.459,RIGHT.
00:36:51.459,00:36:54.212,"SO, SHE NEVER SAID WHO HE WAS, WHAT HE DID FOR A LIVING?"
00:36:58.800,00:37:01.511,ANNALISE IS TRYING TO FIND HIM.
00:37:03.180,00:37:04.681,"WELL, I WISH SHE FOUND HIM ALREADY."
00:37:04.681,00:37:06.850,THEN I WOULDN'T BE HERE TALKING TO YOU.
00:37:15.192,00:37:17.986,"HEY. UH, HOW WAS IT?"
00:37:17.986,00:37:20.947,LIKE BEING STRIP-SEARCHED WITH WORDS.

00:37:43.762,00:37:45.346,YOU'RE A LIAR.
00:37:45.346,00:37:48.349,"AT THIS POINT, THAT'S ALL I KNOW FOR SURE."
00:37:48.349,00:37:50.977,SLEEP ON THE COUCH.

00:38:52.956,00:38:56.835,"YOU DIDN'T TELL HER, DID YOU, THAT I WAS THE ONE WHO MESSED WITH THE JURY?"
00:38:56.835,00:38:58.753,YOU THINK YOU'D STILL BE WORKING HERE IF I DID?
00:38:58.753,00:39:00.463,WHY DIDN'T YOU?
00:39:00.463,00:39:04.425,"I MEAN, 'CAUSE DID YOU EVER THINK I WANTED HER TO KNOW THAT WE WON THIS CASE BECAUSE OF ME?"
00:39:04.425,00:39:05.802,WE DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING.
00:39:05.802,00:39:07.386,"IT GOT US A MISTRIAL, WHICH WAS LUCKY."
00:39:07.386,00:39:12.100,"NO, IT WAS SMART, BUT THANK YOU -- I MEAN, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME TO SAY."

00:39:22.068,00:39:24.654,"OH, RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU KNEW SHE WOULD NEVER SCREW YOU."
00:39:24.654,00:39:26.656,LIKE I'D EVER WANT TO SCREW YOU.

00:02:22.059,00:02:24.185,TOLD HIM I WAS AT THE LIBRARY.
00:02:38.784,00:02:40.953,Annalise: TAKE YOUR SEATS.

00:02:43.497,00:02:53.132,"OUR LESSON -- HABEAS CORPUS, WHICH TRANSLATES INTO PRODUCE THE BODY."
00:02:53.132,00:02:57.636,WHO CAN TELL US HOW THAT APPLIES TO THE CASE FAY vs. NOIA?
00:03:03.017,00:03:05.602,Wes: YOUR HUSBAND'S MR. DARCY.
00:03:05.602,00:03:09.023,YOU'RE CONFUSED.
00:03:09.023,00:03:12.191,YOU JUST CAN'T STOP LYING.

00:03:30.919,00:03:32.963,SOMEONE'S HAVING A BRAIN FART.
00:03:34.965,00:03:40.554,FAY v. NOIA DECLARED AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE IMPRISONMENT DOESN'T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF LAW MUST BE RELEASED.
00:03:40.554,00:03:44.474,"THIS IS DONE BY WAY OF HABEAS CORPUS, A.K.A., TO PRODUCE THE BODY."
00:03:44.474,00:03:47.227,"THANKS, MISS PRATT."
00:03:47.227,00:03:51.857,WHO CAN TELL US WHAT HAPPENS IN A HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDING?
00:03:56.862,00:03:59.364,SOMETHING'S COME UP.
00:04:07.039,00:04:08.540,LOOKS LIKE THE KEATING FIVE MIGHT BE FOUR FROM NOW ON.
00:04:08.540,00:04:10.458,Laurel: MAYBE WES IS SICK.
00:04:10.458,00:04:12.086,I BET THE PRESSURE FINALLY GOT TO HIM AND HE DROPPED OUT.
00:04:13.503,00:04:15.589,"GOD, ENOUGH WITH THE STUPID TROPHY."
00:04:15.589,00:04:18.967,"HEY, IT'S ONLY STUPID 'CAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN IT, L-L-L-LOSER."
00:04:18.967,00:04:20.719,WE HAVE A NEW CASE.
00:04:20.719,00:04:23.013,"OKAY, BUT FIRST THING'S FIRST -- IS THE TROPHY IN PLAY?"
00:04:23.013,00:04:24.598,TO THOSE OF YOU SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP.
00:04:24.598,00:04:34.108,"21 YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS A LAW STUDENT NOT UNLIKE ALL OF YOU, THERE WAS A LOCAL MAN, DAVID ALLEN, WHO WAS PUT ON TRIAL FOR THE MURDER OF HIS GIRLFRIEND, TRISHA STANLEY."
00:04:34.108,00:04:41.823,"NOW, THE PROSECUTION ARGUED THAT DAVID HAD GONE INTO TRISHA'S APARTMENT AND SHOT HER BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT SHE'D FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER BOSS."
00:04:41.823,00:04:48.496,"AND DESPITE THERE BEING NOTHING BUT CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS THEORY, DAVID WAS CONVICTED OF MURDER."
00:04:48.496,00:04:56.213,"NOW, THIS WAS THE FIRST CASE THAT OPENED MY EYES TO THE FACT THAT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM DOESN'T ALWAYS REWARD THOSE WHO TELL THE TRUTH..."
00:04:56.213,00:04:59.591,BUT THOSE WHO HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE THEIR OWN.
00:04:59.591,00:05:03.220,AND IT'S A FACT THAT'S PISSED ME OFF EVER SINCE I HEARD ABOUT THIS CASE.
00:05:03.220,00:05:09.350,"BUT TODAY, WE'VE BEEN HANDED THE CHANCE TO MAKE AN UNJUST SYSTEM JUST."
00:05:09.350,00:05:17.609,"ONE HOUR AGO, THE PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT GRANTED MY PETITION TO DEVELOP NEW FACTS OF DAVID ALLEN'S CONVICTION."
00:05:17.609,00:05:21.238,"IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, WE'RE WORKING OUR FIRST APPEAL."
00:05:21.238,00:05:34.084,"NOW, THE EMERGENCY HEARING THAT WE'VE BEEN GRANTED IS IN THREE DAYS, SO I HOPE YOU'RE ALL RESTED AND FOCUSED, BECAUSE WHAT WE ACCOMPLISH IN THE NEXT 72 HOURS WILL DETERMINE DAVID'S FATE."
00:05:34.084,00:05:36.253,David: THEN I WAS THINKING STEAK.
00:05:36.253,00:05:40.966,"A NEW YORK CUT, 16 OUNCES, WELL-DONE."
00:05:40.966,00:05:45.095,"LOBSTER, FRIED CHICKEN, RIBS."
00:05:45.095,00:05:48.431,WHICH IS WHY I'M TAKING VOTES FROM EVERYBODY WHO VISITS.
00:05:48.431,00:05:51.977,WHAT WOULD YOUR LAST MEAL BE?
00:05:55.814,00:05:59.734,DON'T MESS WITH ME RIGHT NOW.
00:05:59.734,00:06:01.111,THE COURT CALLED.
00:06:01.111,00:06:04.198,THEY'RE GONNA GIVE US ONE MORE SHOT.
00:06:04.198,00:06:05.907,Annalise: THAT'S RIGHT.
00:06:05.907,00:06:08.160,IT'S A DEATH-ROW CASE.
00:06:08.160,00:06:13.498,"AND UNLESS WE DO OUR JOBS, DAVID WILL DIE BY LETHAL INJECTION IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS."
00:06:19.963,00:06:23.175,THANK YOU.
00:06:23.175,00:06:26.427,YOU DON'T THANK ME UNTIL YOU'RE OUT OF THIS PRISON.
00:06:33.643,00:06:36.771,Michaela: THAT'S WHEN I SAW MR. ALLEN RUN FROM THAT WOMAN'S APARTMENT.
00:06:36.771,00:06:40.025,"HE HAD A LOOK OF TERROR IN HIS EYES, LIKE HE HAD JUST DONE SOMETHING AWFUL."
00:06:40.025,00:06:42.944,"I FROZE AS SOON AS I SAW HIM, SCARED."
00:06:42.944,00:06:45.364,THAT'S WHEN I SAW THE .38 IN HIS HANDS.
00:06:45.364,00:06:48.200,"THAT'S YOUR LINE, CONNOR."
00:06:48.200,00:06:50.160,"OH, RIGHT."
00:06:50.160,00:06:52.829,"OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR."
00:06:50.160,00:06:55.874,DID THE WITNESS AT THE TIME ACTUALLY KNOW THE CALIBER OF THE -- OF THE WEAPON?
00:06:55.874,00:06:57.918,SAID DEFENSE ATTORNEY GEORGE GABLER.
00:06:57.918,00:07:02.421,"UH, SUSTAINED, SAID JUDGE MILLS-- WAIT."
00:07:03.590,00:07:05.466,"HA, VERY FUNNY."
00:07:05.466,00:07:06.885,I'M NOT KIDDING.
00:07:06.885,00:07:08.887,"YOUR DAD'S WILLIAM MILLSTONE, RIGHT?"
00:07:08.887,00:07:11.056,LET ME SEE THAT.
00:07:13.350,00:07:15.143,WHAT THE...?
00:07:17.478,00:07:19.064,DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?
00:07:19.064,00:07:21.108,NO IDEA.
00:07:23.610,00:07:25.570,WES COULD BE AT THE POLICE STATION RIGHT NOW.
00:07:25.570,00:07:27.739,Annalise: HE DIDN'T GO TO THE POLICE.
00:07:27.739,00:07:29.490,I DO. HE'S A CONFUSED CHILD.
00:07:29.490,00:07:31.410,MAYBE I SHOULD GET A LAWYER.
00:07:31.410,00:07:33.328,I SHOULD GO TO THE POLICE AND GET AHEAD OF THIS THING.
00:07:35.705,00:07:37.540,"WHAT IS THE PLAN HERE, THEN?"
00:07:35.705,00:07:38.875,"THIS WAS ALREADY A MESS, AND NOW YOU'VE GOT TO ARGUE A DEATH-ROW CASE IN THREE DAYS FROM NOW."
00:07:38.875,00:07:43.213,"BECAUSE WHEN I FILED THE PETITION, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SCREWING SOME WHITE WHORE."
00:07:49.136,00:07:52.055,"UH, FRANK JUST CALLED."
00:07:52.055,00:07:54.599,GREAT.
00:07:56.768,00:07:59.146,BON.
00:07:59.146,00:08:01.856,"LOOK, I JUST, UH..."
00:08:05.693,00:08:09.072,FOR PUTTING UP WITH ALL OUR CRAP.
00:08:09.072,00:08:10.073,I KNOW IT'S A LOT.
00:08:10.073,00:08:12.575,IT'S FOR ANNALISE.
00:08:12.575,00:08:14.995,I'D DO ANYTHING FOR HER.
00:08:25.297,00:08:27.799,WE MISSED YOU IN CLASS TODAY.
00:08:38.768,00:08:43.148,YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ANSWERING YOUR PHONE OR YOUR DOOR.
00:08:43.148,00:08:45.400,EVERYONE'S BEEN ASKING FOR YOU.
00:08:45.400,00:08:47.944,THEY'RE WORRIED THAT YOU WERE SICK.
00:08:47.944,00:08:51.072,"WE EVEN GOT A NEW CASE TODAY, A DEATH-ROW APPEAL."
00:08:51.072,00:08:54.242,IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF YOU MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON IT.
00:08:57.745,00:09:00.081,Wes: YOU CAN TAKE THAT BACK.
00:09:00.081,00:09:01.708,I DON'T WANT IT.
00:09:11.218,00:09:13.803,YOU AND REBECCA?
00:09:13.803,00:09:15.055,WHAT DO YOU WANT?
00:09:17.098,00:09:20.852,"THAT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I CAME HERE TO ASK YOU."
00:09:24.605,00:09:26.149,WHAT YOU WANT.
00:09:27.526,00:09:28.693,STOP THIS.
00:09:28.693,00:09:31.779,STOP WHAT?
00:09:36.368,00:09:40.621,I WROTE IT ALL DOWN -- EVERYTHING I KNOW.
00:09:40.621,00:09:43.624,I HAVE ANOTHER COPY IN A SAFE-DEPOSIT BOX.
00:09:43.624,00:09:47.504,ONE PHONE CALL AND IT GETS SENT TO THE POLICE.
00:09:49.339,00:09:52.800,UNLESS?
00:09:52.800,00:09:55.429,ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER?
00:09:55.429,00:09:57.472,IT'S ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING.
00:09:57.472,00:10:00.683,AND YOU THINK THAT MEANS PROTECTING THE DRUG DEALER NEXT DOOR?
00:10:00.683,00:10:04.396,PUTTING YOUR BLIND FAITH IN SOMEONE YOU BARELY EVEN KNOW?
00:10:04.396,00:10:09.484,AND PLEASE DON'T TELL ME IT'S BECAUSE YOU THINK SHE'S INNOCENT.
00:10:09.484,00:10:11.194,I THINK SHE'S AS INNOCENT AS YOUR HUSBAND.
00:10:11.194,00:10:15.865,YOU REALLY NEED TO STOP THINKING THAT ME PROTECTING REBECCA AND MY HUSBAND ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
00:10:15.865,00:10:19.660,THE IDEA THAT I DON'T HAVE HER BEST INTERESTS AT HEART IS ONLY IN YOUR HEAD.
00:10:19.660,00:10:21.455,SO PROVE IT.
00:10:21.455,00:10:23.873,FIND HER AND GET HER BACK HERE.
00:10:25.083,00:10:26.960,WHATEVER IT TAKES.
00:10:26.960,00:10:29.796,"OR I SWEAR TO GOD, I'LL TELL THE POLICE EVERYTHING."
00:10:42.809,00:10:45.103,THERE YOU ARE.
00:10:45.103,00:10:47.230,THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE AVOIDING ME.
00:10:47.230,00:10:49.483,YOU WERE THE ONE OUT OF THE OFFICE ALL DAY.
00:10:49.483,00:10:52.444,ANNALISE HAVING YOU DO SOME SPY WORK?
00:10:52.444,00:10:54.695,WHAT KIND OF SPY WOULD I BE IF I TOLD YOU WHAT I WAS DOING?
00:10:54.695,00:10:57.031,"OH, COME ON."
00:10:57.031,00:10:59.326,AFRAID YOU'LL KISS ME AGAIN IF WE GET TOO CLOSE?
00:11:01.620,00:11:03.997,"I THINK IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND, ACTUALLY."
00:11:05.332,00:11:07.334,WE'LL CALL IT MUTUAL.
00:11:07.334,00:11:08.918,WE'LL CALL IT NEVER HAPPENING AGAIN. HOW'S THAT?
00:11:08.918,00:11:11.754,COFFEE READY?
00:11:14.757,00:11:16.801,FRANK.
00:11:16.801,00:11:18.803,YOU FORGOT YOUR COFFEE.
00:11:18.803,00:11:21.889,RIGHT.
00:11:26.478,00:11:29.606,Annalise: I'D LIKE MR. GIBBINS BROUGHT UP TO SPEED.
00:11:29.606,00:11:31.232,NOW.
00:11:31.232,00:11:34.444,"Asher: PROFESSOR KEATING, I-I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY."
00:11:34.444,00:11:37.947,I JUST WANTED TO ASK -- DID YOU KNOW MY FATHER PRESIDED OVER THE ORIGINAL DAVID ALLEN TRIAL?
00:11:41.493,00:11:44.871,"SO, WES, YOU'RE NOT CONTAGIOUS, ARE YOU?"
00:11:44.871,00:11:46.373,Connor: THAT DEPENDS.
00:11:46.373,00:11:48.291,IS LYING CONTAGIOUS?
00:11:48.291,00:11:50.877,"HONESTLY, G, ENOUGH WITH THE SECRETS."
00:11:50.877,00:11:54.631,"THEY'RE JUST MAD BECAUSE THEY KNOW IF THEY EVER MISSED CLASS, ANNALISE WOULD NOT CARE."
00:11:54.631,00:11:58.051,"SO, WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS CASE?"
00:11:58.051,00:11:59.718,Annalise: THE PUPPY'S ACTING UP.
00:11:59.718,00:12:02.222,I NEED YOU TO FIND REBECCA RIGHT AWAY.
00:12:02.222,00:12:05.266,I'M GUESSING SHE'S BEING PUT UP BY ONE OF HER DRUG CONNECTIONS.
00:12:05.266,00:12:06.976,AND WHAT DO I SAY TO HER?
00:12:06.976,00:12:08.895,"I ASKED YOU TO FIND HER, NOT MAKE CONTACT."
00:12:10.438,00:12:14.526,Annalise: WE HAVE LESS THAN 65 HOURS BEFORE WE ARGUE IN FRONT OF THE STATE SUPREME COURT.
00:12:14.526,00:12:17.571,THAT MEANS NO SLEEP UNTIL WE FIND OUT HOW TO WIN THE APPEAL.
00:12:17.571,00:12:21.074,"WES AND LAUREL, FIND OUT IF THERE WAS ANY INEFFECTIVE COUNSEL."
00:12:21.074,00:12:24.118,"START WITH A VISIT TO HIS ORIGINAL ATTORNEY, GEORGE GABLER."
00:12:24.118,00:12:26.538,"BELIEVE ME, THIS CASE WAS UNWINNABLE."
00:12:26.538,00:12:29.999,"I MEAN, YOU GOT DAVID ALL BUT CAUGHT WITH A SMOKING GUN."
00:12:29.999,00:12:33.670,YOU GOT THE NEIGHBORS WHO ALL HEARD THE FIGHT THE NIGHT BEFORE.
00:12:35.129,00:12:37.090,DO I EXPECT THIS TO SLOW YOU TWO DOWN?
00:12:37.090,00:12:42.512,"YOU KIDS, WITH ALL YOUR HOPE, ALL THIS, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY GETS A BLUE RIBBON NONSENSE."
00:12:42.512,00:12:43.930,YOU WANT SOME REAL ADVICE?
00:12:43.930,00:12:47.434,TWO WORDS -- CORPORATE LAW.
00:12:50.520,00:12:55.233,"Annalise: CONNOR AND MICHAELA, THE ORIGINAL PROSECUTOR, A.D.A. VINCE TRAVERS."
00:12:55.233,00:12:57.776,TRAVERS LEFT THE CASE MID-TRIAL.
00:12:57.776,00:13:00.739,I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S A STORY BEHIND HIS DISAPPEARING ACT.
00:13:00.739,00:13:03.324,Vince: STATE WAS HACKING OUR BUDGET BIG TIME IN THE EARLY '90s.
00:13:03.324,00:13:04.909,"I GOT BURNT OUT, FRANKLY."
00:13:04.909,00:13:06.536,NEEDED A MINUTE TO RELAX.
00:13:06.536,00:13:07.954,"Connor: SO, THAT WAS IT, THEN?"
00:13:07.954,00:13:09.872,JUST DROPPED A BIG CASE LIKE THAT?
00:13:09.872,00:13:11.958,IT WAS THE CASE OR ME.
00:13:13.334,00:13:18.381,"BONNIE, THE EYEWITNESS, LINDA MORELLI, I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE SHE SAW THAT DAY THAT COULD BE A SUSPECT."
00:13:18.381,00:13:19.633,I'M GOING TO HER PLACE TOMORROW.
00:13:19.633,00:13:21.384,WHAT ABOUT ME?
00:13:21.384,00:13:23.762,OLD LADIES FIND ME CHARMING.
00:13:23.762,00:13:26.556,TAKE MR. MILLSTONE WITH YOU.
00:13:26.556,00:13:30.602,THERE'S NOTHING ELSE YOU RECALL SEEING THAT DAY BEFORE SEEING DAVID LEAVE THE SCENE OF THE MURDER?
00:13:30.602,00:13:32.270,GOSH...
00:13:32.270,00:13:35.482,"I WISH I COULD SAY, BUT THAT'S A LOT OF YEARS AGO."
00:13:35.482,00:13:41.028,"AND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO PUSH THE MEMORY OUT OF MY HEAD, NOT BACK IN."
00:13:41.028,00:13:44.865,"EXCUSE ME, MA'AM, BUT ARE THOSE PRESCRIPTION GLASSES YOU'RE WEARING?"
00:13:44.865,00:13:47.452,YES.
00:13:44.865,00:13:50.455,"AND I KNOW WHY YOU'RE ASKING, BUT I DIDN'T NEED THEM TILL A FEW YEARS AGO."
00:13:50.455,00:13:52.457,I WISH IT WERE DIFFERENT.
00:13:52.457,00:13:55.376,BUT I SAW HIM WITH THAT GUN.
00:13:58.755,00:14:01.466,Laurel: DAVID HAD AN ALIBI?
00:14:01.466,00:14:03.384,GUY NAMED J-WAT.
00:14:03.384,00:14:06.845,SKY-HIGH ON HEROIN EVERY TIME I TRIED TO TALK TO HIM.
00:14:06.845,00:14:10.517,I DIDN'T NEED THE JURY TO ASSOCIATE DAVID WITH SOMEONE LIKE THAT.
00:14:10.517,00:14:12.310,Connor: APPRECIATE YOUR HELP.
00:14:12.310,00:14:14.395,KNOW HOW BUSY YOU MUST BE.
00:14:14.395,00:14:17.273,"WELL, HAVE A GOOD ONE."
00:14:20.819,00:14:26.658,HOW RELAXING WERE THE DEPOS YOU TOOK IN THE STATE'S CASE AGAINST THE DOCKWORKERS' UNION TWO DAYS LATER?
00:14:26.658,00:14:33.414,"TRAVERS WON'T ADMIT TO ANY OF THIS ON RECORD, BUT APPARENTLY HE WAS TIPPED TO THERE BEING PERJURED TESTIMONY IN THE DAVID ALLEN CASE."
00:14:33.414,00:14:38.545,"HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS, BUT HE SENT WORD TO JUDGE MILLSTONE TO LOOK INTO IT, AND..."
00:14:40.004,00:14:42.674,AND?
00:14:42.674,00:14:45.176,AND APPARENTLY JUDGE MILLSTONE DID NOTHING ABOUT IT.
00:14:45.176,00:14:46.969,WHAT?
00:14:46.969,00:14:48.763,"OKAY, GUYS, THIS TRAVERS GUY IS CLEARLY A WHACK JOB."
00:14:48.763,00:14:50.223,"GO ON, MISS PRATT."
00:14:50.223,00:14:53.309,Michaela: TRAVERS WAS RE-ASSIGNED TO A DIFFERENT CASE BY THE D.A.
00:14:53.309,00:14:57.397,"HE SAID HE THOUGHT THERE WAS PRESSURE TO CONVICT, PERHAPS EVEN MOTIVATED BY RACE."
00:14:57.397,00:14:59.399,"OKAY, SERIOUSLY, MY FATHER ISN'T A SLEAZE."
00:14:59.399,00:15:02.402,HE WASN'T A PART OF SOME RACIST SCHEME.
00:15:02.402,00:15:04.111,REALLY?
00:15:04.111,00:15:07.073,IT'S NOT JUST WHITE PEOPLE WHO GO TO KENNEBUNKPORT.
00:15:08.658,00:15:11.494,"MY FATHER WROTE THE BOOK ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT, LITERALLY."
00:15:11.494,00:15:13.162,HE'S A HIGHLY RESPECTED FEDERAL JUDGE.
00:15:13.162,00:15:15.956,YOU DON'T GET TO WHERE HE'S GOTTEN BY BURYING EVIDENCE OF PERJURY.
00:15:15.956,00:15:18.292,"BELIEVE ME, MY DAD WOULDN'T DO THIS."
00:15:19.627,00:15:23.172,LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A NEW TARGET -- JUDGE WILLIAM MILLSTONE.
00:15:24.758,00:15:28.469,YOU WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST PERSON IN THE WORLD DISAPPOINTED BY YOUR FATHER.
00:15:45.570,00:15:48.239,Laurel: THERE'S A GAS STATION UP ON ELM THAT'S OPEN.
00:15:48.239,00:15:51.033,WHERE'S ELM? MAYBE SAM KNOWS.
00:15:51.033,00:15:53.578,"WHAT, ANY IDEAS, PAL?"
00:15:53.578,00:15:55.747,WE COULD RUN INTO PEOPLE WE KNOW.
00:15:55.747,00:15:57.707,GO TO ROUTE 6 INSTEAD.
00:15:57.707,00:16:00.334,WHERE THE HELL IS ROUTE 6?
00:16:02.295,00:16:04.046,"WAIT, REALLY?"
00:16:04.046,00:16:06.299,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
00:16:06.299,00:16:09.093,"UH, YEAH. TOTALLY."
00:16:09.093,00:16:10.762,YES!
00:16:10.762,00:16:14.014,THIS IS FREAKING WHACK-A-MOLE.
00:16:31.240,00:16:34.661,ASHER!
00:16:34.661,00:16:36.496,"HEY, GLORIA."
00:16:36.496,00:16:38.915,"I, UH, THINK I LEFT A BOOK IN HERE A WHILE BACK."
00:16:38.915,00:16:43.002,GOOD LUCK FINDING IT.
00:16:43.002,00:16:47.214,"YEAH, I THINK I'LL, UM, LOOK FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES, AND THEN I'LL GIVE UP."
00:17:13.199,00:17:14.534,Annalise: WHO'S J-WAT?
00:17:14.534,00:17:16.118,JASON WATKINS.
00:17:16.118,00:17:18.412,HE WAS THIS KID IN MY VOLUNTEER PROGRAM.
00:17:18.412,00:17:23.459,"HE HAD THIS JOB INTERVIEW BUT NO CLOTHES TO WEAR, SO I MET HIM AT MY APARTMENT TO GET HIM A SUIT HE COULD BORROW."
00:17:23.459,00:17:25.837,"ALL RIGHT, SO THERE WAS ONLY THE TWO OF YOU IN THE APARTMENT?"
00:17:27.797,00:17:32.343,"I CHILLED WITH HIM TILL ABOUT 8:00, THEN I WENT TO TRISHA'S ALONE."
00:17:32.343,00:17:35.722,SAW THE POLICE CARS PARKED OUT FRONT AND...
00:17:35.722,00:17:40.601,"ANYWAY, NOT MUCH OF AN ALIBI NOW, IS IT?"
00:17:40.601,00:17:43.646,YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM?
00:17:43.646,00:17:45.982,HE LIVED UP ON 72nd BY THE BUS STATION.
00:17:45.982,00:17:47.942,WE'LL TRY TO FIND HIM.
00:17:47.942,00:17:49.485,"WAIT, WAIT. H-HOLD ON."
00:17:49.485,00:17:52.405,"SERIOUSLY, HOW YOU LIKING OUR CHANCES?"
00:17:52.405,00:17:57.493,"IF I SPEND THE AFTERNOON SITTING HERE LOOKING AT YOUR SAD FACE, I DON'T LIKE THEM AT ALL."
00:17:59.913,00:18:01.622,ALL RIGHT.
00:18:01.622,00:18:03.416,Connor: WHAT'S WRONG WITH LOOKING INTO DADDY DOUCHEFACE?
00:18:03.416,00:18:05.877,WOULD YOU WANT ONE OF US DOING IT TO YOURS?
00:18:05.877,00:18:07.962,MAYBE THEY COULD ACTUALLY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT THE GUY.
00:18:07.962,00:18:10.590,"WOW, SOMEONE HAVE DADDY ISSUES?"
00:18:10.590,00:18:12.008,SOMEONE HAVE A GAY FIANCé?
00:18:12.008,00:18:14.594,WHAT DID WE FIND?
00:18:14.594,00:18:20.182,THERE ISN'T ANYTHING IN THE TRIAL TRANSCRIPT TO SUGGEST THAT JUDGE MILLSTONE WAS PREJUDICED TOWARD A CONVICTION.
00:18:20.182,00:18:23.686,AND I CAN'T FIND A SINGLE ALLEGATION OF MISCONDUCT IN HIS OVER 20 YEARS ON THE BENCH.
00:18:23.686,00:18:25.521,MAYBE ASHER WAS RIGHT.
00:18:25.521,00:18:27.440,MAYBE TRAVERS WAS JUST TRYING TO GET ME OUT OF HIS OFFICE.
00:18:27.440,00:18:29.943,DO I DETECT PREJUDICE IN YOUR VOICE?
00:18:29.943,00:18:34.989,"IF YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE LENS FAVORABLE TO YOUR FRIEND'S FATHER, YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR."
00:18:34.989,00:18:37.408,"CLINICAL OBJECTIVITY, MISS PRATT."
00:18:37.408,00:18:39.535,I have no time now.
00:18:39.535,00:18:41.537,"Time's running out for Rebecca, too."
00:18:41.537,00:18:43.414,She has a hearing next week.
00:18:43.414,00:18:46.042,I told you I'll find her.
00:18:46.042,00:18:48.002,DID YOU FIND JASON WATKINS?
00:18:48.002,00:18:50.755,YES.
00:18:50.755,00:18:53.716,O.D.'d 15 MONTHS AGO.
00:19:38.928,00:19:41.139,"COME ON, GIRL."
00:19:55.153,00:19:58.156,Annalise: I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING ELSE FOR ME.
00:19:58.156,00:20:00.116,JUST BETWEEN US.
00:20:00.116,00:20:01.325,WHATEVER YOU NEED.
00:20:04.954,00:20:07.123,"William: SO, HOW'S IT GOING IN SCHOOL?"
00:20:07.123,00:20:09.125,YOU STILL WORKING WITH THAT ATTORNEY?
00:20:09.125,00:20:13.379,WHAT'S HER NAME?
00:20:13.379,00:20:18.509,"YOU KNOW, WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON AN APPEAL FOR A CASE THAT YOU PRESIDED OVER."
00:20:18.509,00:20:20.427,DAVID ALLEN?
00:20:20.427,00:20:24.557,"GUY IN, UH, NORTH PHILLY, CONVICTED OF KILLING HIS GIRLFRIEND?"
00:20:24.557,00:20:27.560,SURE.
00:20:32.023,00:20:38.112,"YOU KNOW, AS A KID, I USED TO ALWAYS LOOK THROUGH YOUR JOURNALS."
00:20:38.112,00:20:40.907,YEARS OF MEETINGS METICULOUSLY DOCUMENTED.
00:20:40.907,00:20:43.450,IT'S...IT'S IMPRESSIVE.
00:20:43.450,00:20:47.287,"IN ALL THAT TIME, THERE'S..."
00:20:47.287,00:20:49.916,...ONLY ONE DAY UNACCOUNTED FOR.
00:20:49.916,00:20:53.544,ONE IN 30 YEARS.
00:20:53.544,00:20:57.924,THE DAY YOU MET WITH THE PROSECUTOR ON THE DAVID ALLEN CASE.
00:20:57.924,00:21:02.011,I DON'T FOLLOW YOU.
00:21:10.853,00:21:12.563,WHERE'D YOU GET AN IDEA LIKE THIS?
00:21:12.563,00:21:17.902,"THAT SAME SUMMER, A MONTH AFTER THAT VERDICT, YOU RECEIVED YOUR FEDERAL APPOINTMENT."
00:21:17.902,00:21:21.530,YOU WERE AN UNDERDOG FOR THE JOB.
00:21:21.530,00:21:25.618,MOM ALWAYS SAID YOUR PAL ART TRUCCO PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR YOU.
00:21:25.618,00:21:29.663,IS THIS KEATING WOMAN PUTTING THESE CRAZY IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD?
00:21:29.663,00:21:34.460,"YOUR WHOLE LIFE, YOU HAVE PRIDED YOURSELF ON THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T LIE."
00:21:34.460,00:21:43.469,AND NOW I'M SITTING HERE ACCUSING YOU OF GRAVE JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT...
00:21:43.469,00:21:47.681,AND YOUR ONLY RESPONSE IS TO ASK ME WHERE I GOT THE IDEA?
00:21:50.810,00:21:53.146,"TELL ME I'M WRONG, DAD."
00:21:53.146,00:21:59.318,"PLEASE, TELL ME THAT YOU DIDN'T GET TO WHERE YOU ARE ON THE BACK OF A MAN WHO'S GONNA DIE."
00:21:59.318,00:22:02.989,"PLEASE, DAD."
00:22:04.531,00:22:06.075,TELL ME I'M WRONG.
00:22:11.330,00:22:12.999,"YOU CAN'T, CAN YOU?"
00:22:15.584,00:22:17.044,GET OUT.
00:22:15.584,00:22:18.963,DAD -- AFTER ALL I'VE DONE FOR YOU?
00:22:18.963,00:22:23.050,YOU UNGRATEFUL LITTLE TWIT.
00:22:26.012,00:22:28.306,GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE.
00:22:55.082,00:22:57.793,"WELCOME BACK, MR. MILLSTONE."
00:23:00.213,00:23:03.257,READY TO REJOIN THE EFFORT?
00:23:03.257,00:23:06.802,THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR CONCESSION TO MY TWO STIPULATIONS.
00:23:06.802,00:23:09.847,THOSE BEING?
00:23:09.847,00:23:11.724,"ONE, YOU SPARE MY FATHER."
00:23:11.724,00:23:14.101,NO ONE CAN KNOW THE ROLE HE PLAYED IN DAVID'S CONVICTION.
00:23:14.101,00:23:15.811,SO HE DID PLAY A ROLE.
00:23:15.811,00:23:18.647,LIKE I'M GONNA TELL YOU THAT BEFORE YOU AGREE TO MY DEMAND.
00:23:18.647,00:23:21.234,MY FATHER'S NAME STAYS OUT OF IT. AGREED OR NOT?
00:23:21.234,00:23:23.903,AGREED.
00:23:23.903,00:23:25.154,DEMAND NUMBER TWO?
00:23:28.657,00:23:30.868,I WANT THE TROPHY.
00:23:37.041,00:23:39.168,DEAL...
00:23:39.168,00:23:41.670,IF YOUR INFORMATION IS AS GOOD AS YOU SAY IT IS.
00:23:43.630,00:23:44.840,"OH, IT'S GOOD."
00:23:47.760,00:23:54.432,"WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO FALSELY TESTIFIED IN DAVID'S TRIAL, BUT WE DO KNOW IT WAS TO SATISFY THIS MAN."
00:23:54.432,00:24:03.441,"ART TRUCCO IS A STATE SENATOR WHO, FOR REASONS WE NEED TO FIND OUT, NEEDED DAVID ALLEN TO GO DOWN FOR THIS MURDER, SO MUCH SO THAT HE CONVINCED SOMEONE TO LIE ON THE STAND."
00:24:03.441,00:24:07.905,"IF WE CAN FIND OUT WHO THIS WAS, WE STAND A GOOD CHANCE OF SEEING THIS CONVICTION OVERTURNED."
00:24:07.905,00:24:10.157,WE HAVE 12 HOURS TILL COURT.
00:24:10.157,00:24:11.992,LET'S MAKE DAVID PROUD.
00:24:11.992,00:24:16.872,THIS ISN'T MY -- THIS ISN'T MY -- WHO'S ON TRUCCO'S TAXES?
00:24:16.872,00:24:18.456,"$30,000 A YEAR?"
00:24:18.456,00:24:20.376,HOW CAN WE PAY TEACHERS IN THIS COUNTRY SO LITTLE?
00:24:20.376,00:24:21.835,WELCOME TO AMERICA.
00:24:21.835,00:24:23.754,Wes: I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATE HOUR.
00:24:23.754,00:24:28.301,"UH, I WAS HOPING TO TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND ABOUT A CASE HE WORKED BACK IN '93."
00:24:40.354,00:24:42.231,Asher: IS IT POSSIBLE TRUCCO WAS A BIG PLAYER DURING THE RE-DISTRICTING STRIKE?
00:24:42.231,00:24:44.400,TRUCCO'S SON WAS A COP. MAYBE HE KNEW THE LEAD DETECTIVE.
00:24:44.400,00:24:45.818,OR DAVID'S BANK DID BUSINESS WITH TRUCCO.
00:24:45.818,00:24:47.445,OR HOW ABOUT AN AFFAIR WITH A WITNESS?
00:24:47.445,00:24:52.074,ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE NEIGHBOR WHO HEARD THE SHOT OR THE CO-WORKER?
00:25:20.686,00:25:24.815,"LITTLE LATE TO GO OUT, ISN'T IT?"
00:25:24.815,00:25:26.900,YOU WORRIED ABOUT ME NOW?
00:25:26.900,00:25:29.028,THAT'S CUTE.
00:25:29.028,00:25:33.407,YOU'RE LOOKING FOR REBECCA.
00:25:33.407,00:25:35.368,THE PUPPY'S GOT YOU RUNNING RECON FOR HIM NOW?
00:25:35.368,00:25:41.040,MAYBE REBECCA'S OUR CLIENT AND I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HER.
00:25:41.040,00:25:43.876,NICE TRY.
00:25:49.882,00:25:52.468,WITH ME. NOW.
00:25:54.845,00:25:57.306,STOP LEADING FRANK ON.
00:25:57.306,00:25:58.932,WHAT?
00:25:58.932,00:26:01.852,"FRANK AND I ARE JUST -- DON'T, LAUREL."
00:26:01.852,00:26:03.437,I SEE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT HIM.
00:26:03.437,00:26:06.315,"MORE IMPORTANTLY, I SEE THE WAY HE LOOKS AT YOU."
00:26:06.315,00:26:08.108,AND LET'S BE HONEST.
00:26:08.108,00:26:10.777,"IT'S NOT FRANK A RICH GIRL LIKE YOU ENDS UP WITH, IS IT?"
00:26:10.777,00:26:12.654,AND YOU KNOW THAT.
00:26:12.654,00:26:15.157,"HELL, THAT'S THE FUN IN IT FOR YOU."
00:26:15.157,00:26:22.915,"NO, THAT'S -- BUT WHAT SUCKS IS, FRANK DOESN'T KNOW THAT -- THAT YOU'RE JUST LEADING HIM ON, LETTING HIM BELIEVE HE HAS A SHOT WITH YOU."
00:26:22.915,00:26:26.001,"AND WHEN HE FINDS OUT HE DOESN'T, THAT'S GOING TO HURT HIM."
00:26:28.670,00:26:31.924,YOU'RE BECOMING A REAL ASSET TO THIS TEAM.
00:26:31.924,00:26:36.929,I WOULD HATE FOR ANNALISE TO FIND OUT YOU WERE SCREWING WITH SOMEONE SHE CONSIDERS FAMILY.
00:26:36.929,00:26:41.058,David: OF COURSE I KNOW WHO ART TRUCCO IS.
00:26:41.058,00:26:43.477,HE OWNED A BUNCH OF PROPERTIES IN FAIRMOUNT.
00:26:47.856,00:26:49.649,POOR BLACK PEOPLE.
00:26:49.649,00:26:56.407,"WELL, WHITE FOLKS COULD AFFORD TRISHA WAS LEADING THE CHARGE AGAINST THE DEVELOPMENT, BUT SHE HAD NO POWER."
00:26:56.407,00:26:59.826,DEFINITELY NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP HIM FROM DOING WHATEVER HE WANTED.
00:26:59.826,00:27:02.329,OR THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED YOU TO THINK.
00:27:11.547,00:27:14.841,"OH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?"
00:27:14.841,00:27:18.762,THE REAL ABOUT YOU AND REBECCA.
00:27:18.762,00:27:21.098,YOU TAPPING THAT ASS OR WHAT?
00:27:21.098,00:27:22.933,"THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, CONNOR."
00:27:22.933,00:27:24.935,SHE'S RIGHT.
00:27:24.935,00:27:26.979,HMM. EVASIVE.
00:27:26.979,00:27:28.688,"YOU GUYS, STOP."
00:27:28.688,00:27:30.732,"MUST BE HOT, SLEEPING WITH A MURDERER."
00:27:30.732,00:27:34.027,"Asher: WAIT, YOU'RE SCREWING OUR CLIENT?"
00:27:34.027,00:27:37.114,AND THE GUY WITH THE CORRUPT DAD DOESN'T GET TO SAY CRAP TO ME RIGHT NOW.
00:27:37.114,00:27:38.698,TAKE THAT BACK.
00:27:38.698,00:27:40.909,YOUR DAD SENT A GUY TO DEATH ROW FOR NO REASON.
00:27:40.909,00:27:42.578,"Michaela: HONESTLY, HOW DOES THAT FEEL?"
00:27:42.578,00:27:45.623,KNOWING THAT YOUR CHARMED EXISTENCE CAME AT THE EXPENSE OF ANOTHER MAN'S LIFE?
00:27:45.623,00:27:52.838,"Connor: WELL, I'M SURE IT'S NOT THE FIRST INSTANCE THE KENNEBUNKPORT MILLSTONES HAVE PROFITED OFF OTHER PEOPLE'S MISFORTUNES."
00:27:52.838,00:27:54.590,AAH!
00:27:57.134,00:27:58.844,THAT'S THE BEST THING I'VE SEEN IN DAYS.
00:27:58.844,00:28:00.638,Annalise: WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?
00:28:00.638,00:28:04.057,MAN'S LIFE HANGS IN THE BALANCE AND THIS IS HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME?
00:28:04.057,00:28:06.101,Asher: WAIT.
00:28:06.101,00:28:08.061,Michaela: IT'S MINE. IT'S FROM TRUCCO'S REAL-ESTATE GROUP.
00:28:08.061,00:28:10.189,I'VE SEEN THIS LOGO BEFORE.
00:28:10.189,00:28:12.399,I SAW HIM WITH THAT GUN.
00:28:14.276,00:28:16.903,IN LINDA MORELLI'S PARKING GARAGE.
00:28:19.281,00:28:24.702,"PEOPLE, THE KEY EYEWITNESS LIVES IN A BUILDING OWNED BY SENATOR TRUCCO."
00:28:24.702,00:28:28.207,SO...IT'S...
00:28:29.625,00:28:32.294,IT'S ALWAYS THE ONE YOU LEAST SUSPECT.
00:28:52.648,00:28:54.900,"JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL SET ON THAT OTHER THING."
00:28:54.900,00:28:56.485,GOOD.
00:28:57.486,00:28:59.321,THANKS.
00:29:02.700,00:29:04.618,SHE SEEMS NERVOUS.
00:29:04.618,00:29:06.036,WOULDN'T YOU BE?
00:29:22.177,00:29:25.347,YOU KNOW YOUR LIFE'S WEIRD WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY TO BE BACK IN COURT.
00:29:25.347,00:29:28.141,"FOR THE LAST TIME, IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT."
00:29:30.644,00:29:35.524,Crier: THE HONORABLE CHIEF JUSTICE AND JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
00:29:35.524,00:29:39.528,"OYEZ, OYEZ, OYEZ."
00:29:39.528,00:29:48.203,ALL MEN OR PERSONS WHO STAND BOUND BY RECOGNIZANCE OR WHO OTHERWISE HAVE BUSINESS BEFORE THIS COURT MAY NOW APPEAR AND THEY SHALL BE HEARD.
00:29:48.203,00:29:54.418,"IN JULY OF 1993, MISS MORELLI, YOU FACED AN EVICTION SUIT BY THE OWNER OF YOUR BUILDING."
00:29:54.418,00:29:56.336,WHY WERE YOU BEING EVICTED?
00:29:56.336,00:29:58.922,FOR FAILURE TO MAKE RENT.
00:29:58.922,00:30:01.383,I WAS THREE MONTHS BEHIND.
00:30:01.383,00:30:10.392,"MY HUSBAND, HE GAMBLED, AND -- SO YOU WERE BEING THROWN ON THE STREET, AND YET FOUR DAYS AFTER YOU TESTIFIED TO SEEING DAVID ALLEN, THE SUIT WAS DROPPED."
00:30:10.392,00:30:14.480,"ACCORDING TO THE RECORDS WE'VE OBTAINED, YOU NEVER PAID THE RENT YOU OWED."
00:30:14.480,00:30:18.484,IS THAT BECAUSE YOUR PAYMENT WAS YOUR TESTIMONY IN THE DAVID ALLEN TRIAL?
00:30:20.319,00:30:24.906,CAN YOU TELL THE COURT WHO OWNED YOUR BUILDING?
00:30:24.906,00:30:27.326,GREEN ASH PROPERTIES.
00:30:29.286,00:30:33.123,THE SAME ART TRUCCO WHO'S GONE ON TO BECOME STATE SENATOR TRUCCO?
00:30:33.123,00:30:34.792,THAT IS CORRECT.
00:30:33.123,00:30:43.592,BUT I -- DID ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH MR. TRUCCO TELL YOU THAT YOUR RENT PROBLEMS WOULD DISAPPEAR IF YOU TESTIFIED THAT YOU SAW DAVID ALLEN CARRYING THE GUN THAT DAY?
00:30:43.592,00:30:46.470,THE WITNESS CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE INTENTIONS OF SENATOR TRUCCO.
00:30:46.470,00:30:50.056,WHICH IS WHY I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE STATE AT THIS TIME TO SUBPOENA SENATOR TRUCCO.
00:30:50.056,00:30:52.518,WHAT? NO!
00:30:50.056,00:30:54.853,MY CLIENT IS SET TO DIE BASED ON THE PERJURED TESTIMONY OF MISS MORELLI.
00:30:54.853,00:30:58.190,THAT IS AN EGREGIOUS LIE.
00:30:58.190,00:31:05.572,"WOULD THE COURT LIKE TO BE PUT ON RECORD FOR REFUSING TO HEAR HIS TESTIMONY, ALL THE WHILE, SENATOR TRUCCO IS SITTING IN HIS CORNER OFFICE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET?"
00:31:05.572,00:31:08.283,"PLEASE, YOUR HONOR."
00:31:11.453,00:31:19.419,"SENATOR TRUCCO, IN 1993, YOU DEVELOPED THE LAND AT PENN'S LANDING INTO WHAT IS NOW TRUCCO PLAZA."
00:31:19.419,00:31:21.338,IS THIS CORRECT?
00:31:21.338,00:31:24.216,I KNOW THIS.
00:31:24.216,00:31:27.427,THE FEW MILLION PEOPLE ANNUALLY THAT TRAFFIC THE PLAZA KNOW THIS.
00:31:27.427,00:31:29.304,CAN WE CUT TO THE CHASE HERE?
00:31:29.304,00:31:31.390,MY CONSTITUENTS EXPECT ME TO MAKE THE MOST OF MY TIME.
00:31:31.390,00:31:43.527,"I HAVE A RECORD OF AN INJUNCTION BROUGHT AGAINST YOUR PROJECT BY TRISHA STANLEY, ADVOCATING FOR THE THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS LIVING IN LOW-INCOME HOUSING WHO WOULD BE DISPLACED BY YOUR PROJECT."
00:31:43.527,00:31:44.986,WAS THERE A QUESTION IN THERE?
00:31:44.986,00:31:46.905,"10 DAYS AFTER, MISS STANLEY WAS MURDERED."
00:31:46.905,00:31:53.537,"YOUR ATTORNEY STRUCK DOWN THE INJUNCTION, AND YOUR PROJECT WENT FORWARD UNOPPOSED."
00:31:53.537,00:31:59.334,"SO MY QUESTION IS, SENATOR TRUCCO, DID YOU HAVE TRISHA STANLEY MURDERED?"
00:32:02.170,00:32:04.089,ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
00:32:04.089,00:32:06.258,"YOUR HONOR, THIS HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH."
00:32:06.258,00:32:14.516,"DID YOU CONVINCE YOUR TENANT LINDA MORELLI TO TESTIFY THAT TRISHA STANLEY WAS KILLED BY HER BOYFRIEND, DAVID ALLEN -- YOU ARE WAY OFF BASE."
00:32:14.516,00:32:19.479,EXPLAIN WHY YOUR EVICTION SUIT AGAINST MISS MORELLI WAS DROPPED DESPITE HER INABILITY TO PAY RENT.
00:32:19.479,00:32:24.568,Thomas: MS. KEATING -- IS IT BECAUSE HER LOST RENT MONEY WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE MILLIONS YOU MADE ONCE MISS STANLEY WAS OUT OF YOUR WAY?
00:32:24.568,00:32:26.653,"ANSWER THE QUESTION, SENATOR."
00:32:26.653,00:32:28.697,"MS. KEATING, ENOUGH."
00:32:28.697,00:32:33.993,"MR. CHIEF JUSTICE, I HAVE EXTENDED GREAT DEFERENCE TO THE COURT BY SHOWING UP HERE TODAY."
00:32:36.580,00:32:41.293,"I AM SORRY, SENATOR, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO ANSWER FOR WHO BORE THE REAL COST OF YOUR DEVELOPMENT."
00:32:41.293,00:32:46.548,"NOT JUST TRISHA STANLEY AND HER BOYFRIEND, DAVID ALLEN, WHO SERVED 21 YEARS IN PRISON..."
00:32:46.548,00:32:50.469,...BUT THE THOUSANDS WHO WERE DISPLACED IN THE NAME OF LINING YOUR POCKETS...
00:32:50.469,00:32:52.178,Thomas: MS. KEATING!
00:32:50.469,00:32:55.641,"...THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE POOR, POWERLESS, AND DIDN'T BEAR THE COLOR OF SKIN DESIRABLE TO YOUR BUSINESS INTERESTS."
00:32:55.641,00:32:57.517,"THAT'S ENOUGH, MS. KEATING!"
00:32:57.517,00:32:58.936,"MS. KEATING, I WANT ORDER!"
00:32:58.936,00:33:00.353,"YOU DESTROYED LIVES, SENATOR."
00:33:00.353,00:33:01.521,ADMIT IT.
00:33:01.521,00:33:06.025,"ADMIT YOU KILLED TRISHA STANLEY AND HAD MY CLIENT, DAVID ALLEN, SET UP FOR HER MURDER."
00:33:06.025,00:33:08.654,THAT IS ENOUGH!
00:33:08.654,00:33:12.699,"YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD, AND I'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO THROW YOU IN JAIL."
00:33:17.830,00:33:19.665,IF I WANTED TO BE HER BEFORE...
00:33:19.665,00:33:22.334,THAT'S NOT SOMETHING SHE CAN TEACH US.
00:33:22.334,00:33:25.504,"HERE'S A QUESTION -- IF SHE GETS DISBARRED, DOES IT GO ON OUR RECORDS, TOO?"
00:33:27.297,00:33:29.758,Crier: WILL THE DEFENDANT PLEASE RISE?
00:33:29.758,00:33:36.598,"Thomas: MS. KEATING, MAY I SAY, WE ARE BEYOND DISMAYED BY THE CONDUCT YOU'VE EXHIBITED HERE TODAY."
00:33:36.598,00:33:51.571,"YOU'VE OPERATED WITH BLATANT DISRESPECT FOR THIS COURT AND ITS PROTOCOLS, AND YOUR ARGUMENT, WHEN ISOLATED FROM ALL THE BLUSTER, SEEMS TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SPECULATION."
00:33:51.571,00:34:03.917,"THE CASE AGAINST YOUR CLIENT SEEMS TO BE BUILT ON THE SAME GROUND, ROOTED SINGULARLY IN AN EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE FAITH IN."
00:34:03.917,00:34:15.846,"AS A RESULT, IT IS OUR RECOMMENDATION THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OPEN AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ACTIONS OF SENATOR TRUCCO AND THE STATE'S ORIGINAL WITNESS, LINDA MORELLI."
00:34:17.723,00:34:20.767,"NOW, MR. ALLEN..."
00:34:20.767,00:34:24.437,WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT...
00:34:24.437,00:34:30.360,"...CONVICTION, AND SENTENCE OF DEATH, AND PROHIBIT A RE-TRIAL."
00:34:30.360,00:34:32.404,YOU ARE A FREE MAN.
00:34:38.368,00:34:40.370,LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE.
00:34:42.330,00:34:43.957,FOR DINNER TONIGHT.
00:34:43.957,00:34:46.960,THANK YOU.
00:34:46.960,00:34:48.670,THANK YOU.
00:34:48.670,00:34:51.423,GO BE WITH YOUR FAMILY.
00:34:53.759,00:34:56.386,MM.
00:34:59.180,00:35:01.391,"OH, MY BABY."
00:35:13.070,00:35:18.909,THE POLICE FOUND NEW EVIDENCE THAT GRIFFIN KILLED LILA BECAUSE SHE WAS DATING ANOTHER MAN.
00:35:23.413,00:35:31.088,"Reporter: AFTER RECEIVING AN ANONYMOUS TIP, DETECTIVES SEARCHED MR. O'REILLY'S CAR AND DISCOVERED A CELLPHONE BELIEVED TO BELONG TO LILA STANGARD."
00:35:31.088,00:35:33.966,I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING ELSE FOR ME.
00:35:37.761,00:35:42.975,"HAVE YOUR GUY CLEAR ANY SOURCE OF WHERE THE PHOTOS CAME FROM -- PHONE NUMBER, IDENTIFYING INFORMATION."
00:35:42.975,00:35:44.059,"HE CAN DO THAT, CORRECT?"
00:35:44.059,00:35:46.603,I'LL MAKE SURE.
00:35:46.603,00:35:54.277,POLICE ARE REPORTING THE CELLPHONE MAY CONTAIN EVIDENCE OF A RELATIONSHIP THAT LILA STANGARD WAS HAVING WITH AN INDIVIDUAL OTHER THAN GRIFFIN O'REILLY.
00:35:54.277,00:36:02.786,"OUR SOURCES REPORT THERE MAY BE EVEN PHOTOS THAT SUPPORT A THEORY THAT LILA BROKE THE COUPLE'S VIRGINITY PACT, GIVING O'REILLY A MOTIVE IN MISS STANGARD'S MURDER."
00:36:02.786,00:36:07.916,"ACCORDING TO POLICE, THEY'RE -- WHAT ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND?"
00:36:07.916,00:36:09.668,"THAT'S MY CONCERN, NOT YOURS."
00:36:12.378,00:36:14.380,GO TELL REBECCA IT'S SAFE TO COME HOME.
00:36:14.380,00:36:17.009,FRANK HAS THE ADDRESS WHERE SHE'S STAYING.
00:36:24.599,00:36:27.019,WHATEVER IT TAKES.
00:36:27.019,00:36:30.022,ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID?
00:36:47.413,00:36:48.623,OH!
00:36:48.623,00:36:50.625,"GOD, YOU'RE SUCH A KLUTZ."
00:36:50.625,00:36:52.460,"I GOT THIS, FRANK."
00:36:52.460,00:36:55.630,IT'S OKAY.
00:36:55.630,00:37:02.137,"TO HAVE TO SAY THIS, BUT I'M NOT INTO YOU, AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE WE WORK TOGETHER."
00:37:02.137,00:37:04.597,SO YOU HAVE TO STOP.
00:37:04.597,00:37:07.142,LET'S KEEP THIS PROFESSIONAL.
00:37:07.142,00:37:10.062,OTHERWISE I'M GONNA HAVE TO TELL ANNALISE.
00:37:10.062,00:37:12.064,TELL ANNALISE?
00:37:12.064,00:37:13.857,I'M NOT GOING TO.
00:37:12.064,00:37:15.901,"I JUST -- YEAH, YOU'RE NOT INTO ME."

00:37:40.133,00:37:42.510,WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING?
00:37:42.510,00:37:44.179,SHE'S DEFENDING YOU.

00:37:57.109,00:37:59.194,WE BOTH DO.

00:38:43.529,00:38:50.620,OR IS IT THE PROOF PROSECUTORS NEEDED TO SHOW MR. O'REILLY HAD MOTIVE FOR KILLING HIS GIRLFRIEND?

00:04:22.345,00:04:33.065,"THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO CODEFENDANTS BEFORE, BUT NOW AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE IS CLAIMING IT WAS MISS SUTTER WHO INITIATED THE PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP, AS MR. O'REILLY HAD TAKEN A VOW OF VIRGINITY."
00:04:33.065,00:04:35.358,CALL THE JUDGE AND GET A HEARING FOR A GAG ORDER.
00:04:35.358,00:04:44.243,PROOF OF A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO CODEFENDANTS CERTAINLY GIVES MORE WEIGHT TO THE PROSECUTION'S THEORY THAT IT WAS MISS SUTTER WHO MANIPULATED MR. O'REILLY INTO KILLING HIS GIRLFRIEND.
00:04:44.243,00:04:46.120,YOU STILL FEEL LIKE MAKING JOKES NOW?
00:04:46.120,00:04:52.000,"WITH THIS EVIDENCE, IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK MORE AND MORE LIKE THE STORY OF A YOUNG LOVE TRIANGLE GONE TRAGICALLY AWRY."
00:04:56.421,00:05:02.469,THE PROSECUTION HAS LEAKED GOSSIP TO THE PRESS IN ORDER TO SLUT-SHAME MY CLIENT AND POISON THE JURY POOL.
00:05:02.469,00:05:04.930,...FOR AN IMMEDIATE GAG ORDER.
00:05:04.930,00:05:07.515,SHE CAN MAKE ALL THE WILD ALLEGATIONS SHE WANTS.
00:05:07.515,00:05:09.434,SLUTTER CLEANS UP PRETTY NICE.
00:05:09.434,00:05:11.311,MY OFFICE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS LEAK.
00:05:11.311,00:05:20.445,"O'REILLY AND SUTTER HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WHILE HIGH ON COCAINE, MARIJUANA, AND METHAMPHETAMINES, AND THAT'S A DIRECT QUOTE FROM THE DETECTIVE'S STATEMENT IN DISCOVERY."
00:05:20.445,00:05:21.989,WHICH DOESN'T PROVE THAT MY OFFICE WAS BEHIND IT.
00:05:21.989,00:05:24.992,IT COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY BEEN MR. O'REILLY AND HIS COUNSEL.
00:05:24.992,00:05:32.249,"RIGHT, BECAUSE RELEASING INFORMATION THAT PAINTS MY CLIENT -- A DEVOUT, BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIAN -- AS A DRUG-TAKING, SEX-CRAZED JOCK SERVES OUR CASE HOW?"
00:05:32.249,00:05:33.667,IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO LEAKED IT.
00:05:33.667,00:05:37.045,EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IT'S THE WOMAN WHO GETS VILIFIED IN THESE SCENARIOS.
00:05:37.045,00:05:39.089,"I MEAN, LOOK AT THESE ARTICLES."
00:05:39.089,00:05:43.468,"IT'S MY CLIENT'S FACE SMEARED ACROSS THE FRONT PAGE, NOT MR. O'REILLY'S."
00:05:43.468,00:05:45.386,I DON'T HAVE EDITORIAL CONTROL OVER THE PAPERS.
00:05:45.386,00:05:47.014,Judge: ENOUGH GRANDSTANDING.
00:05:47.014,00:05:56.231,HOWEVER THIS INFORMATION GOT OUT -- AND THIS COURT WILL BE INVESTIGATING JUST THAT -- THE PUBLIC'S APPETITE FOR THIS CASE COULD RESULT IN UNDUE BIAS FOR THE CODEFENDANTS.
00:05:56.231,00:05:59.151,"THEREFORE, I'M GRANTING THE GAG ORDER."
00:05:56.231,00:06:00.819,"AND FROM HERE ON OUT, NONE OF YOU OR YOUR CLIENTS SPEAK TO THE PRESS."
00:06:00.819,00:06:02.279,"Keegan: THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR."

00:06:09.452,00:06:11.412,WE'RE ALL HERE ALREADY.
00:06:11.412,00:06:19.213,MY TEAM'S FORENSIC EXPERT REVIEWED THE AUTOPSY PHOTOS AND DISCOVERED SEVERAL OVERLOOKED RED MARKS ON THE SIDE OF MISS STANGARD'S NECK.
00:06:19.213,00:06:23.466,HE'LL TESTIFY THAT THESE MARKS ARE FINGERNAIL PUNCTURE WOUNDS LEFT BY THE MURDERER.
00:06:23.466,00:06:28.930,"SINCE MY CLIENT IS A QUARTERBACK AND KEEPS HIS NAILS CLIPPED SHORT, HE DID NOT LEAVE THOSE MARKS."
00:06:28.930,00:06:30.389,"WHAT IS THE MOTION, YOUR HONOR?"
00:06:30.389,00:06:32.433,OR IS MR. KEEGAN HERE TO JUST TESTIFY?
00:06:32.433,00:06:34.686,WE MOVE TO EXHUME MISS STANGARD'S BODY.
00:06:34.686,00:06:37.189,WE BELIEVE A SECOND AUTOPSY WILL POINT TO REBECCA SUTTER AS THE SOLE MURDERER.
00:06:37.189,00:06:44.403,"YOUR HONOR, HASN'T THE VICTIM'S FAMILY MR. KEEGAN IS MAKING OUTLANDISH REMARKS SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY?"
00:06:44.403,00:06:48.909,THE TWO OF YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO RIGHTEOUSLY OBJECT AT THE HEARING TOMORROW MORNING.
00:06:48.909,00:06:51.119,WE ARE ADJOURNED.
00:07:01.129,00:07:02.589,"SO, THEY JUST DIG UP HER BODY?"

00:07:15.769,00:07:17.771,"NO, I TOTALLY DO."
00:07:17.771,00:07:20.107,WOW. AND I THOUGHT I WAS A SLUT.
00:07:20.107,00:07:22.734,REALLY?
00:07:20.107,00:07:26.321,"YOU'VE GOTTEN NAKED WITH SO MANY BOYS SINCE HACKER BROKE YOUR HEART, YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THEIR NAMES?"
00:07:26.321,00:07:28.489,"THE IMPORTANT THING IS, THEY REMEMBER MINE."
00:07:28.489,00:07:30.533,"PLAY ON, PLAYER."
00:07:30.533,00:07:32.202,"Griffin: HEY, YOU PLANTED THAT PHONE IN MY CAR."
00:07:32.202,00:07:33.703,"OKAY, LIKE I'D KNOW HOW TO DO THAT."
00:07:33.703,00:07:35.038,YOU CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
00:07:35.038,00:07:36.748,I'M LAUGHING AT HOW DUMB YOU ARE.
00:07:36.748,00:07:38.625,YOU ALREADY CONFESSED TO KILLING HER.
00:07:38.625,00:07:40.543,HOW DUMB ARE YOU TO THINK THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET AWAY WITH THIS?
00:07:40.543,00:07:42.879,"NO! WHOA, WHOA."
00:07:42.879,00:07:44.881,IS OUR -- IS OUR CODEFENDANT HARASSING YOU?
00:07:44.881,00:07:49.552,"BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO HAVE TO FILE ASSAULT CHARGES AGAINST MISS SUTTER, TOO."
00:07:49.552,00:07:51.596,"WELL, THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE LAW WORKS, YOUNG MAN."
00:07:51.596,00:07:54.057,"I TEACH MY STUDENTS THE LAW, MR. KEEGAN -- NO ONE ELSE."
00:07:54.057,00:08:00.105,"AND FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING, MY CLIENT WAS DEFENDING HERSELF AGAINST MR. O'REILLY, AND I HAVE WITNESSES HERE WHO COULD TESTIFY TO THAT."
00:08:00.105,00:08:03.233,"WELL, LET'S SAVE THE FUN FOR THE COURTROOM, SHALL WE?"
00:08:03.233,00:08:05.444,"STAY CIVILIZED, YOUNG LADY."
00:08:10.073,00:08:12.117,SHE'S A TERRORIST.
00:08:12.117,00:08:18.832,HONESTLY. IT -- IT MAKES ME GRATEFUL FOR THE MISCARRIAGES.
00:08:18.832,00:08:20.541,ANNIE.
00:08:20.541,00:08:23.544,I'M SERIOUS.
00:08:25.713,00:08:36.057,"ASKING FOR THAT SECOND AUTOPSY WAS A BRILLIANT MOVE, AND I'D HAVE DONE IT MYSELF IF I DIDN'T THINK THAT THEY'D FIND EVIDENCE AGAINST MY CLIENT, WHICH -- LET'S FACE IT -- THEY PROBABLY WILL."
00:08:36.057,00:08:38.018,RELAX.
00:08:38.018,00:08:39.102,STOP.
00:08:39.102,00:08:41.813,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
00:08:41.813,00:08:43.357,YOU ARE WORKING SO HARD.
00:08:43.357,00:08:45.275,LET SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING FOR YOU.
00:08:45.275,00:08:47.194,I SAID STOP.
00:08:53.074,00:08:55.494,I NEED MORE TIME.
00:08:56.828,00:08:59.914,YOU GET ALL THE TIME YOU WANT.
00:08:59.914,00:09:01.791,I'LL BE HERE.
00:09:07.839,00:09:10.550,Frank: IT'S OUR JOB TO KEEP THAT BODY IN THE GROUND.
00:09:10.550,00:09:14.262,"FIRST, THAT MEANS TEARING GRIFFIN'S FORENSIC EXPERT, DR. ERIK TURNER, A NEW ONE."
00:09:14.262,00:09:16.515,THESE ARE THE THOUSANDS OF AUTOPSIES HE'S DONE.
00:09:16.515,00:09:18.850,GO THROUGH THEM.
00:09:18.850,00:09:22.479,"ALSO, COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVE THEORIES FOR THE MARKS ON LILA'S NECK."
00:09:22.479,00:09:24.147,"INSECT BITES, ABRASION FROM THE WATER TANK -- POSTMORTEM DECAY."
00:09:24.147,00:09:26.107,ANYTHING THAT'S NOT REBECCA'S FINGERNAILS.
00:09:26.107,00:09:28.402,IS IT OKAY IF I TAKE A COUPLE HOURS OFF ON WEDNESDAY?
00:09:28.402,00:09:31.863,I JUST GOT A CALL TO COME IN AND INTERVIEW AT STERLING &amp; WHITE.
00:09:31.863,00:09:33.698,YOU'RE MEETING AT STERLING?
00:09:35.658,00:09:39.413,I GUESS THEY START AT THE TOP OF THE CLASS AND WORK THEIR WAY DOWN.
00:09:39.413,00:09:41.581,JUST BE QUICK ABOUT IT.
00:09:41.581,00:09:43.917,EXACTLY. SHOULDN'T WE ALL BE WORKING FULL TIME ON THIS?
00:09:46.044,00:09:48.547,SHE'S NOT MY G-- YEAH. WHATEVER YOU SAY.
00:09:48.547,00:09:50.215,WHAT AN ADORABLE SETUP.
00:09:55.053,00:09:56.763,"SPEAK OF THE DEVIL, AND SHE SHALL APPEAR."
00:09:56.763,00:09:58.390,NO NEED FOR PLEASANTRIES.
00:09:58.390,00:10:01.476,WE BOTH KNOW WHY I'M HERE.
00:10:01.476,00:10:06.565,THE CITY'S MEDICAL EXAMINER PERFORMED A STANDARD AUTOPSY THE FIRST TIME AROUND.
00:10:06.565,00:10:08.442,YOU DON'T WANT THIS MOTION GOING THROUGH ANY MORE THAN I DO.
00:10:08.442,00:10:10.818,THE SURPRISE OF THE UNKNOWN.
00:10:10.818,00:10:15.240,THE SPECTER OF NEW EVIDENCE UNDERMINING THE PROSECUTOR'S WELL-LAID-OUT CASE.
00:10:15.240,00:10:18.159,YOU READ MY MIND.
00:10:22.080,00:10:23.748,WHAT'S THAT?
00:10:23.748,00:10:26.084,A SEALED FILE -- COMMONWEALTH v. HOLDEN.
00:10:26.084,00:10:29.045,IT'LL HELP YOU DESTROY KEEGAN'S EXPERT.
00:10:29.045,00:10:30.755,WHY NOT USE IT YOURSELF?
00:10:30.755,00:10:38.597,"IT'LL ALSO DISCREDIT ABOUT A DOZEN OTHER CONVICTIONS THE D.A.'s OFFICE WON IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS -- NONE OF WHICH HAPPENED UNDER MY WATCH, OF COURSE."
00:10:39.806,00:10:41.266,YOU'LL USE IT?
00:10:45.103,00:10:50.108,EXPERT WITNESSES ARE THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM.
00:11:00.743,00:11:10.211,"Turner: SO, THE SIZE, SHAPE, AND CURVATURE OF THE PERFORATIONS AND THE POSTMORTEM COLOR TINT ALL SUPPORT MY CONCLUSION THAT THESE ARE FINGERNAIL PUNCTURE WOUNDS."
00:11:10.211,00:11:13.965,AND YOU BELIEVE THAT THE BRUISING PATTERN HERE POINTS TO HAND SIZE.
00:11:13.965,00:11:15.425,EXACTLY -- SOMEONE WITH SMALL HANDS.
00:11:15.425,00:11:18.845,"THANK YOU, DR. TURNER."
00:11:18.845,00:11:22.265,HOW DO YOU COMBAT THIS CORRUPTION WITHIN THE EXPERT COMMUNITY?
00:11:25.018,00:11:30.148,"YOU IMPEACH THE EXPERT'S CREDIBILITY, PREFERABLY BY POINTING OUT ANY SKETCHY EVIDENCE THEY PRESENTED IN THE PAST."
00:11:30.148,00:11:31.983,"THROW SHADE AT THEM, BASICALLY."
00:11:31.983,00:11:40.659,"DR. TURNER, LET'S TALK ABOUT COMMONWEALTH vs. HOLDEN, A MURDER TRIAL THAT YOU PROVIDED EXPERT TESTIMONY AT LAST YEAR THAT HELPED CONVICT THE DEFENDANT."
00:11:45.372,00:11:52.920,I HAVE AN INTERNAL REPORT FROM THE D.A.'s OFFICE THAT QUESTIONS THE METHODS AND CONCLUSIONS OF YOUR WORK IN THE HOLDEN CASE.
00:11:52.920,00:11:54.589,OBJECTION!
00:11:54.589,00:11:56.757,"I OBJECT, AS WELL."
00:11:54.589,00:11:58.759,"I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS REPORT, BUT EVEN IF IT CHECKS OUT, IT'S HEARSAY."
00:12:01.095,00:12:10.063,"SO, LET'S ASK DR. TURNER IF HE WAS MADE AWARE OF THE REPORT -- PERHAPS WHEN THE D.A.'s OFFICE BANNED YOU AS AN EXPERT WITNESS BECAUSE OF YOUR NEGLIGENT WORK?"
00:12:10.063,00:12:11.856,"ASSUMING FACTS NOT IN EVIDENCE, YOUR HONOR."
00:12:11.856,00:12:14.651,"DR. TURNER, WERE YOU AWARE SUCH A REPORT EXISTS?"
00:12:16.194,00:12:18.697,"YES, YOUR HONOR, BUT -- NOTHING FURTHER."
00:12:20.240,00:12:21.824,"Annalise: NEXT, COUNTERATTACK."
00:12:21.824,00:12:25.328,FIND AN EXPERT TO OUT-EXPERT YOUR OPPONENTS.
00:12:25.328,00:12:27.955,ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THEY COULD BE INSECT BITES?
00:12:27.955,00:12:33.878,"THERE'S A SPECIES CALLED -- REDHEADS, LIKE MISS STANGARD, HAVE HUNDREDS OF FRECKLES, BLEMISHES."
00:12:33.878,00:12:36.172,"SOMETIMES, A MARK IS JUST A MARK."
00:12:36.172,00:12:40.218,"NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME -- THEY'RE TRYING TO PIN THIS MURDER ON AN INNOCENT GIRL."
00:12:40.218,00:12:42.761,"SO, PLEASE -- LOOK AT THE BOOK."
00:12:42.761,00:12:48.643,"WHEN YOU PERFORMED THE ORIGINAL AUTOPSY, WHAT DID YOU THINK THE RED MARKS ON LILA'S NECK WERE?"
00:12:48.643,00:12:50.645,FRECKLES.
00:12:48.643,00:12:55.442,"UPON FURTHER RESEARCH, I NOW THINK THEY'RE POSTMORTEM BITES FROM INSECTS OF THE CULICIDAE FAMILY."
00:12:55.442,00:13:00.863,"IS THAT POSSIBLE, GIVEN THAT LILA STANGARD'S BODY WAS IN A WATER TANK FOR SEVERAL DAYS?"
00:13:00.863,00:13:02.657,THAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE LIKELY.
00:13:02.657,00:13:04.992,THE CULEX SPECIES THRIVES IN WATER-BASED ENVIRONMENTS.
00:13:04.992,00:13:07.412,NOTHING FURTHER.
00:13:07.412,00:13:12.333,Annalise: THERE'S ONE MORE WAY TO BLOCK THE MOTION -- CONVINCE LILA'S PARENTS TO MAKE A STATEMENT AGAINST THE EXHUMATION.
00:13:12.333,00:13:16.630,"YOU FIGURE THAT OUT, AND YOU'LL GET A REWARD BETTER THAN THE TROPHY."
00:13:18.423,00:13:20.133,"Kan: NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME, MA'AM."
00:13:20.133,00:13:26.431,"T-THERE ARE RATS CRAPPING ALL OVER HER APARTMENT, SPREADING GOD KNOWS WHAT DISEASES, SO MAYBE HE SHOULD BE THE ONE GETTING EVICTED."
00:13:26.431,00:13:28.015,HELLO?
00:13:31.185,00:13:33.521,TANYA'S EVICTION CASE?
00:13:33.521,00:13:37.692,THE COURT ISN'T LETTING THE LANDLORD'S PREVIOUS GRIEVANCES INTO EVIDENCE.
00:13:37.692,00:13:43.615,"I THOUGHT DANIEL WAS GONNA WRITE UP A MOTION ABOUT -- WELL, DAN GOT A JOB WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE."
00:13:43.615,00:13:46.326,"TESS GOT A BOYFRIEND, SO SHE STOPPED SHOWING UP."
00:13:46.326,00:13:55.418,"I HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE TO REPLACE THEM, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY TIME BECAUSE MY CLIENT AND HER FOUR KIDS ARE GOING TO BE LIVING ON MY COUCH IF I DON'T WIN THIS CASE."
00:13:55.418,00:13:58.630,REALLY?
00:14:05.804,00:14:07.472,HI.
00:14:10.517,00:14:11.934,WHAT?
00:14:11.934,00:14:15.271,YOU KNOW WHO I COULD HIRE WITHOUT HAVING TO GIVE AN INTERVIEW?
00:14:17.231,00:14:19.359,I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T HIRE FIRST-YEARS.
00:14:19.359,00:14:22.612,WE DON'T.
00:14:24.071,00:14:25.657,UH...
00:14:25.657,00:14:27.575,I KNOW. I KNOW -- YOU WOULD NEVER LEAVE KEATING.
00:14:27.575,00:14:30.244,I WOULDN'T?
00:14:30.244,00:14:32.997,I'M A DESPERATE MAN HERE.
00:14:32.997,00:14:36.334,LET ME...
00:14:36.334,00:14:38.378,"OF COURSE, YEAH."
00:14:38.378,00:14:41.422,"YOU KNOW, JUST SO YOU KNOW, THEY, UH..."
00:14:41.422,00:14:44.425,"THEY FINALLY FIXED THE LOCK ON MY OFFICE DOOR, SO..."
00:14:47.387,00:14:48.847,SO...
00:14:48.847,00:14:51.599,DESSERT COULD BE...
00:14:54.435,00:14:59.023,HERE'S A CASE WHERE THE COURT RULED AGAINST EXHUMATION ON RELIGIOUS GROUNDS.
00:14:59.023,00:15:01.108,"IF THE STANGARDS WERE RELIGIOUS, THEN -- THEY'RE NOT."
00:15:01.108,00:15:04.863,THAT'S WHY THEY WERE SO WEIRDED OUT WHEN SHE MADE THAT VIRGINITY PACT WITH GRIFFIN.
00:15:15.164,00:15:17.458,"HEY, WHAT ABOUT MEASURING MY NAILS TO SEE IF THEY MATCH?"
00:15:17.458,00:15:21.212,"IF THEY DON'T, WE CAN DO THAT WHOLE IF THE GLOVE DON'T FIT, YOU MUST ACQUIT THING."
00:15:22.672,00:15:25.925,O.J. TRIAL.
00:15:22.672,00:15:27.968,IT'S JUST THAT -- OKAY. IT'S A STUPID IDEA.
00:15:27.968,00:15:30.930,"NO, IT'S NOT A STUPID IDEA."
00:15:30.930,00:15:33.140,"AND YES, I KNOW WHAT PATRONIZE MEANS, FANCY IVY LEAGUE BOY."
00:15:33.140,00:15:36.811,YOU THINK THAT I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE TIME HANGING AROUND PLACES LIKE MIDDLETON?
00:15:36.811,00:15:39.814,"HOW WOULD I KNOW? YOU'RE, LIKE, THE MOST PRIVATEST PERSON EVER."
00:15:43.568,00:15:47.363,"I WENT TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE, THEN GOT A DEGREE FROM A NIGHT SCHOOL IN WILLOWICK."
00:15:47.363,00:15:49.031,WHERE THE HELL'S THAT?
00:15:49.031,00:15:53.661,"I'M JUST SAYING, YOU CAN DO SOMETHING AFTER THIS THAT'S NOT DEALING DRUGS."
00:15:53.661,00:15:56.414,"LIKE, GO TO COLLEGE, LAW SCHOOL, EVEN."
00:15:59.667,00:16:02.670,BE THE COUNTRY'S FIRST EX-JUVIE DRUG-DEALER BARTENDER PRESIDENT.
00:16:03.838,00:16:05.506,I'M KIDDING.
00:16:05.506,00:16:08.008,"I KNOW. I'LL STOP, OKAY?"
00:16:12.639,00:16:14.724,I'LL JUST STOP TRYING TO HELP.
00:16:16.810,00:16:18.352,NO. DON'T.
00:16:22.649,00:16:24.400,YOU SHOULD KEEP TRYING.
00:16:34.118,00:16:36.120,I GOT TO GO.
00:16:49.383,00:16:52.261,Wes: DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL I'M BACK.
00:16:52.261,00:16:56.891,"EVEN IF SOMEONE KNOCKS, DON'T ANSWER UNLESS YOU KNOW IT'S ME."
00:16:56.891,00:16:59.560,I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO AS SOON AS WE MAKE A PLAN.
00:16:59.560,00:17:01.228,OKAY?
00:17:02.563,00:17:05.232,HE WANTED TO KILL ME.
00:17:05.232,00:17:06.860,I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE.
00:17:06.860,00:17:08.778,"I HAD TO KILL HIM, OR HE WAS GONNA KILL ME."
00:17:08.778,00:17:10.780,I SAW THE TROPHY SITTING THERE.
00:17:10.780,00:17:12.323,I HIT HIM IN THE HEAD.
00:17:12.323,00:17:14.200,AND I'M GLAD HE'S DEAD.
00:17:14.200,00:17:15.743,STOP IT!
00:17:15.743,00:17:17.829,"LOOK, MY TRIAL'S IN A COUPLE DAYS."
00:17:17.829,00:17:19.330,I'M ALREADY GOING TO JAIL.
00:17:19.330,00:17:23.042,"AND NOW YOU MIGHT, TOO, BECAUSE OF ME, AND I WILL KILL MYSELF IF THAT HAPPENS."
00:17:23.042,00:17:28.088,"SO, PLEASE -- PLEASE JUST LET ME HELP YOU FOR ONCE."
00:17:28.088,00:17:33.469,THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO TO HELP RIGHT NOW IS STAY IN THIS ROOM AND NOT LEAVE.
00:17:35.388,00:17:38.641,I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I CAN.
00:17:52.363,00:17:54.073,"THANK YOU FOR COMING IN, MISS PRATT."
00:17:54.073,00:17:55.783,"YOU'RE AT, UH, MIDDLETON, RIGHT?"
00:17:55.783,00:17:58.912,YES.
00:17:55.783,00:18:04.751,"I WAS ALSO ACCEPTED AT YALE AND COLUMBIA, BUT I FELT THAT MIDDLETON WAS A BETTER FIT FOR THE KIND OF HANDS-ON EDUCATION I WANTED."
00:18:04.751,00:18:08.504,I'VE ADMIRED STERLING &amp; WHITE'S WORK FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW.
00:18:08.504,00:18:13.885,THE VISA ANTITRUST LITIGATION WAS A MASTER CLASS ON INNOVATIVE TRIAL TECHNIQUES.
00:18:13.885,00:18:16.846,"NO ONE TOLD YOU WHY YOU'RE HERE, DID THEY?"
00:18:16.846,00:18:18.890,YOU MEAN WHO REFERRED ME?
00:18:18.890,00:18:21.350,I HATE WHEN THIS HAPPENS.
00:18:21.350,00:18:24.062,"THIS IS WHY YOU'RE HERE, MISS PRATT."
00:18:24.062,00:18:26.731,WE REPRESENT ROBERT AND MARY WALKER.
00:18:26.731,00:18:29.650,YOU'RE MARRYING THEIR SON AIDEN.
00:18:32.987,00:18:34.614,THIS IS A PRENUP.
00:18:38.701,00:18:40.411,Asher: HOW'D THE BIG INTERVIEW GO?
00:18:42.162,00:18:45.499,"I WANT TO MEET WITH OTHER FIRMS, THOUGH, BEFORE I MAKE A COMMITMENT."
00:18:45.499,00:18:48.210,THEY DIDN'T HIRE YOU IN THE ROOM?
00:18:48.210,00:18:49.796,Laurel: AT LEAST SHE GOT IN THE ROOM.
00:18:49.796,00:18:54.759,"MAYBE IF YOU STOPPED STALKING YOUR EX ONLINE ALL DAY, YOU'D ACTUALLY HAVE SOME INTERVIEWS OF YOUR OWN."
00:18:54.759,00:18:55.927,YOU PEOPLE ARE SO BORING.
00:18:55.927,00:18:58.721,I'M HUNGRY. FOOD?
00:19:01.724,00:19:03.726,"HEY, MR. DARCY."
00:19:10.024,00:19:14.654,"SO, THE TERRORIST JUST HANGS OUT AT OUR HOUSE IN HER FREE TIME NOW?"
00:19:14.654,00:19:19.450,WE NEED TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON HER UNTIL HER TRIAL -- KEEP HER FROM SABOTAGING HER OWN CASE.
00:19:23.955,00:19:26.916,I MIGHT...
00:19:23.955,00:19:31.545,KNOW OF A WAY TO HELP YOU CONVINCE THE STANGARDS TO OBJECT TO THE SECOND AUTOPSY.
00:19:36.884,00:19:39.428,SOMETHING LILA TOLD YOU?
00:19:43.850,00:19:47.269,HER PARENTS DIDN'T TRUST GRIFFIN.
00:19:47.269,00:19:49.730,"HE WAS RELIGIOUS AND PRESSURING LILA TO BE, TOO."
00:19:49.730,00:19:55.444,"THEY WORRIED HE WAS TRYING TO CONTROL HER, THAT HE HAD ULTERIOR MOTIVES."
00:20:01.075,00:20:04.162,"SO, ANNALISE IS THE ONE WHO SUGGESTED I COME WITH YOU?"
00:20:04.162,00:20:06.956,SHE THOUGHT WE NEEDED A WOMAN'S TOUCH.
00:20:06.956,00:20:09.750,DON'T THINK I DIDN'T TRY TO TAKE MICHAELA INSTEAD.
00:20:09.750,00:20:13.420,"IF WE'RE GONNA KEEP WORKING WITH EACH OTHER, IT CANNOT BE THIS WEIRD."
00:20:13.420,00:20:15.548,"YOU TOLD ME TO BACK OFF, AND NOW YOU WANT TO BE FRIENDS?"
00:20:15.548,00:20:17.175,THIS ISN'T HIGH SCHOOL.
00:20:17.175,00:20:19.719,"IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME, THEN I DON'T LIKE YOU."
00:20:19.719,00:20:21.387,THAT'S HOW THIS WORKS.
00:20:21.387,00:20:23.347,FREAKIN' MILLENNIALS AND YOUR DAMN ENTITLEMENT.
00:20:24.932,00:20:26.893,HERE SHE COMES.
00:20:34.984,00:20:36.527,OOH! HI!
00:20:36.527,00:20:39.113,"OH, WHAT A CUTE PUPPY!"
00:20:39.113,00:20:40.364,WHAT'S HIS NAME?
00:20:40.364,00:20:41.407,MR. CHIPS.
00:20:41.407,00:20:43.534,HE'S MR. CHIPS!
00:20:43.534,00:20:46.453,I'VE ALWAYS WANTED ONE LIKE HIM.
00:20:47.454,00:20:49.749,YOU WORK FOR THAT LAWYER.
00:20:49.749,00:20:52.168,I'VE SEEN YOU IN COURT.
00:20:52.168,00:20:55.379,MRS. STANGARD -- GET AWAY FROM ME.
00:20:55.379,00:20:57.798,PLEASE. JUST...
00:20:55.379,00:21:01.427,THERE'S AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE TO DOING A SECOND AUTOPSY ON LILA -- ONE THAT HELPS GRIFFIN.
00:21:01.427,00:21:04.388,HIS LAWYER'S DONE THIS BEFORE IN THREE OF HIS OTHER CASES.
00:21:04.388,00:21:09.227,"HE EXHUMED HIS VICTIMS' BODIES, AND EACH TIME, HIS CLIENT WENT FREE."
00:21:09.227,00:21:23.908,"AND IF YOU LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN, THE PAIN YOU AND YOUR FAMILY WILL ENDURE AS YOUR DAUGHTER IS PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND, THAT WILL ALL BE FOR NOTHING, BECAUSE THIS ONLY HELPS GRIFFIN."
00:21:26.202,00:21:31.415,THE IDEA OF LILA ON THAT TABLE -- I-I DIDN'T WANT TO THINK OF WHAT THEY DID TO HER.
00:21:31.415,00:21:35.795,BUT THEN WE GOT TO PUT HER TO REST -- FINALLY.
00:21:35.795,00:21:41.008,"AND NOW THIS MAN -- HE PRETENDS HE WANTS TO FIND THE TRUTH, WHICH IS A LIE."
00:21:41.008,00:21:52.603,"HE WANTS TO CONFUSE THE EVIDENCE, TO ENSURE THAT NO JURY WILL EVER CONVICT GRIFFIN OR HER, THESE TWO MONSTERS, OF KILLING OUR DAUGHTER..."
00:21:56.649,00:21:58.276,...LIKE ANIMALS.
00:21:59.777,00:22:02.238,THEY MURDERED MY BABY GIRL.
00:22:16.961,00:22:19.379,JUST LET HER REST IN PEACE.
00:22:28.055,00:22:31.267,"I KNOW THAT WAS TOUGH, BUT SHE SAID WHAT WE NEEDED TO BLOCK THE EXHUMATION."
00:22:31.267,00:22:32.350,IT'S OKAY.
00:22:33.727,00:22:36.105,"SHE WAS MY FRIEND, OKAY?"
00:22:37.731,00:22:39.275,I DON'T CARE WHAT THAT WOMAN SAID.
00:22:39.275,00:22:43.946,"SHE WAS MY FRIEND, AND -- WHATEVER."
00:22:43.946,00:22:46.657,Michaela: LOOKS LIKE THERE'S TROUBLE IN PARADISE.
00:22:46.657,00:22:49.785,SOME GUYS CAN ONLY GET IT UP FOR CRAZY.
00:22:49.785,00:22:52.205,MYSTERY MAN'S COMING.
00:22:57.626,00:22:59.212,"YOU FORGOT HIS NAME, AND HE'S STILL INTO YOU?"
00:22:59.212,00:23:00.796,"WHAT DO YOU HAVE, SOME SORT OF VOODOO PENIS?"
00:23:00.796,00:23:02.589,SEE YOU BACK AT THE HOUSE.
00:23:02.589,00:23:06.052,I'M SO FREAKIN' MAD I WASN'T BORN GAY.
00:23:09.387,00:23:11.057,JULIEN.

00:23:17.980,00:23:22.026,"LET ME BUY YOU A DRINK, AND IF I PROVE WORTHY OF YOUR TIME, WE MOVE INTO DINNER."
00:23:22.026,00:23:23.777,A DATE.
00:23:26.155,00:23:28.908,"SO, YOU ALSO FORGOT THAT I HAVE A BOYFRIEND."
00:23:30.868,00:23:32.953,"WELL, THIS COULDN'T GET ANY MORE EMBARRASSING."
00:23:33.996,00:23:35.998,RELAX.
00:23:35.998,00:23:37.166,"I BARELY REMEMBER, TOO."
00:23:39.459,00:23:41.503,HOW ABOUT I MAKE YOU REMEMBER?
00:23:48.886,00:23:50.428,"AH, OKAY."
00:23:50.428,00:23:52.932,NOW I DEFINITELY REMEMBER.
00:23:55.017,00:23:58.271,THOUGHT YOU COULD USE A DRINK.
00:23:58.271,00:24:00.647,"VODKA MARTINI, TWIST OF LEMON."
00:24:00.647,00:24:01.815,YOU'RE NOT HAVING ONE?
00:24:01.815,00:24:03.650,I'LL HAVE ONE WITH DINNER.
00:24:03.650,00:24:05.194,YOU HUNGRY?
00:24:05.194,00:24:06.444,MNH.

00:24:27.758,00:24:30.094,Bailiff: PLEASE BE SEATED.
00:24:33.222,00:24:36.058,"MS. PARKS, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A REQUEST."
00:24:36.058,00:24:37.851,"YES, YOUR HONOR."
00:24:37.851,00:24:53.867,"GIVEN THE CONFLICTING TESTIMONY PRESENTED SO FAR, I FELT COMPELLED TO HIRE OUR OWN EXPERT, WHO CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION THAT THE RED MARKS ON THE VICTIM'S NECK ARE CONSISTENT WITH FINGERNAIL PUNCTURE MARKS CAUSED BY A WOMAN."
00:24:53.867,00:24:56.787,I WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT THESE SIGNED AFFIDAVITS INTO TESTIMONY.
00:24:56.787,00:25:01.792,"YOUR HONOR, I FIND IT VERY SUSPICIOUS THAT MS. PARKS HAS SUDDENLY CHANGED HER POINT OF VIEW ON THIS MOTION."
00:25:01.792,00:25:03.002,"I HAD TO, YOUR HONOR."
00:25:03.002,00:25:06.839,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNETHICAL NOT TO REPORT THESE NEW FINDINGS.
00:25:10.301,00:25:11.677,"NEXT CASE, BAILIFF."
00:25:11.677,00:25:13.012,WHAT -- W-WHY DID SHE FLIP?
00:25:13.012,00:25:14.430,I DON'T KNOW.
00:25:14.430,00:25:15.931,WE'LL FIND OUT.
00:25:34.033,00:25:36.994,THANK YOU FOR MEETING ME.
00:25:38.245,00:25:39.872,WHAT DO YOU NEED?
00:25:41.081,00:25:43.750,WENDY PARKS TURNED ON ME TODAY IN COURT.
00:25:48.255,00:25:50.341,IT'S NOT HELPING ME.
00:25:50.341,00:25:51.675,YOU MEAN YOUR HUSBAND.
00:25:58.057,00:25:59.892,HE DIDN'T DO IT.
00:26:01.435,00:26:03.354,YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
00:26:05.523,00:26:08.859,YOU PLANTED LILA'S PHONE IN GRIFFIN'S CAR.
00:26:11.529,00:26:13.072,WHAT?
00:26:13.072,00:26:15.533,YOU SURPRISED SOMEONE'S ONTO YOUR TRICKS?
00:26:19.828,00:26:21.663,YOU SHOULD GO.
00:26:26.626,00:26:28.379,I TRIED TO GIVE YOU AN OUT.
00:26:28.379,00:26:30.797,DON'T FORGET THAT WHEN THIS ALL GOES TO HELL.
00:26:42.600,00:26:44.186,Wes: DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL I'M BACK.
00:27:12.881,00:27:15.593,DISPATCHER: 911.
00:27:16.634,00:27:17.677,Hello?
00:27:17.677,00:27:19.721,911.

00:27:21.432,00:27:23.267,I'M SORRY.
00:27:43.245,00:27:45.331,HELLO?
00:27:45.331,00:27:47.082,Don't worry.
00:27:47.082,00:27:49.042,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
00:27:49.042,00:27:50.252,I know.
00:27:50.252,00:27:53.464,BUT I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU we're taking care of it.
00:27:53.464,00:27:55.299,"They didn't want to at first, but I got them to come around."
00:27:55.299,00:27:57.009,WE'RE GONNA PROTECT YOU.
00:28:01.388,00:28:04.933,Bonnie: THE FASTEST WAY TO UNCOVER SOMEONE'S SECRETS -- GET THEIR ASSISTANT TO TALK.
00:28:04.933,00:28:09.438,THE COUNTY EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY LISTS WENDY PARKS' ASSISTANT AS ALLY BURNHAM.
00:28:09.438,00:28:11.273,OOH! BO-O-O-ING!
00:28:11.273,00:28:16.236,ALLY AND THE REST OF THE GIRLS WHO WORK AT THE D.A.'s OFFICE HANG OUT AT THE THIRSTY WHALE.
00:28:16.236,00:28:19.072,"GO DOWN THERE, FLIRT, FIND OUT WHY SHE CHANGED HER MIND ON THE MOTION."
00:28:19.072,00:28:22.075,"ALL RIGHT. SO WE FIND ALLY AND WE...PUMP HER, SO TO SPEAK."
00:28:22.075,00:28:24.495,ON IT.
00:28:24.495,00:28:25.954,WHAT DO I NEED THEM FOR?
00:28:25.954,00:28:27.456,THIS WORKS ON WOMEN AS WELL AS MEN.
00:28:27.456,00:28:30.042,HE'S RIGHT.
00:28:30.042,00:28:31.751,I'M REALLY GOOD AT FLIRTING WITH GIRLS.
00:28:31.751,00:28:33.170,I'M SURE.
00:28:33.170,00:28:35.713,GIRLS' NIGHT.
00:28:35.713,00:28:38.091,Laurel: IT'S A BIG DECISION.
00:28:38.091,00:28:42.471,I JUST -- I...NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME.
00:28:42.471,00:28:44.764,OKAY. I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I'M LEAVING.
00:28:44.764,00:28:47.434,"YEAH, SURE."
00:28:49.269,00:28:51.438,YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA LOSE MY CASE?
00:28:53.315,00:28:55.817,"THAT'S WHY YOU'RE THINKING OF TAKING ANOTHER JOB, RIGHT?"
00:28:55.817,00:28:57.819,SO YOU DON'T GO DOWN WITH THE SHIP.
00:28:57.819,00:29:03.867,"NO, THAT'S NOT -- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT -- THAT WAS KAN, AND HE WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE JOB AT LEGAL AID."
00:29:13.043,00:29:15.003,I'M SERIOUS.
00:29:15.003,00:29:16.630,DECIDED WHAT?
00:29:16.630,00:29:17.923,SHE WANTS TO LEAVE AND TAKE A JOB WITH HER BOYFRIEND.
00:29:17.923,00:29:19.675,REBECCA!
00:29:19.675,00:29:22.428,THERE ARE A MILLION AND ONE LEGAL AID CLINICS AND ONLY ONE ANNALISE.
00:29:22.428,00:29:24.638,I KNOW THAT! OKAY?
00:29:24.638,00:29:26.390,AND WHAT IF I DO?
00:29:26.390,00:29:28.267,SHE'LL TELL EVERYONE YOUR FIANCé WANTS YOU TO SIGN A PRENUP.
00:29:28.267,00:29:30.936,IT WAS STICKING OUT OF YOUR BAG.
00:29:30.936,00:29:32.605,AIDEN GAVE YOU A PRENUP?
00:29:32.605,00:29:34.565,AND WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS.
00:29:34.565,00:29:36.525,FINE. AS LONG AS YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT THE KAN THING.
00:29:36.525,00:29:39.861,"YOU, TOO."
00:29:39.861,00:29:43.115,IF BOTH OF YOU STOP TALKING ABOUT ME AND WES.
00:29:43.115,00:29:47.327,WE'RE NOT SCREWING.
00:29:47.327,00:29:48.454,FINE.
00:29:48.454,00:29:51.081,OKAY.
00:29:51.081,00:29:54.460,OUT OF A RELATIONSHIP MYSELF.
00:29:54.460,00:29:57.337,OH.
00:29:57.337,00:29:59.965,OLIVE.
00:29:59.965,00:30:01.341,IT'S WORSE.
00:30:01.341,00:30:06.513,"I, UM, I ACTUALLY CHEATED ON HER, AND SHE FOUND OUT, SO..."
00:30:06.513,00:30:11.769,"SO, UH, ALLY, YOU WERE SAYING YOU WORK AT THE D.A.'s OFFICE."
00:30:11.769,00:30:14.563,"HEY, RUDE GUY, WE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION."
00:30:14.563,00:30:15.981,THANKS.
00:30:23.113,00:30:28.786,"I MEAN, I-I SCREWED UP BIG-TIME, AND HE -- S-SHE -- SHE HATES ME."
00:30:28.786,00:30:30.329,SHE HATES ME.
00:30:30.329,00:30:32.498,"I MEAN, I GET IT -- I'M THE BAD GUY."
00:30:32.498,00:30:34.458,TOLD YOU HE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE LADIES.
00:30:38.462,00:30:39.921,SO GET IN THERE AND SHUT HIM UP.
00:30:39.921,00:30:42.341,HELLS NO.
00:30:42.341,00:30:43.509,I'M GETTING SOME TONIGHT.
00:30:43.509,00:30:45.594,TIME TO RELEASE THE KRAKEN!
00:30:45.594,00:30:47.346,I'M TALKING ABOUT MY DINGUS.
00:30:47.346,00:30:49.598,THE OLD DISCO STICK.
00:30:49.598,00:30:52.309,MMM!
00:30:52.309,00:30:54.561,"I SEE YOU, NERDY GIRL WHO PROBABLY STILL LOOKS HOT NAKED."
00:30:54.561,00:30:57.314,I MEAN...I DON'T KNOW.
00:30:57.314,00:30:59.358,GIRLS GET AMNESIA THE MINUTE YOU DO THAT.
00:30:59.358,00:31:01.694,WE'LL FORGIVE YOU THE WORLD.
00:31:01.694,00:31:04.530,"HEY. UH, I SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY PHONE."
00:31:04.530,00:31:06.156,YOUR NUMBER'S NOT IN IT.
00:31:09.159,00:31:12.371,HER NAME'S NATASHA.
00:31:12.371,00:31:14.998,MAYBE...IT'S BRENDA.
00:31:14.998,00:31:16.583,WHY AM I THINKING JAMIE?
00:31:16.583,00:31:18.084,ARE YOU DRUNK?
00:31:18.084,00:31:21.672,WAIT -- DID YOU SAY DRU-- HAMMERED.
00:31:21.672,00:31:29.054,"ANYWAY, SHE TEMPS AT THE D.A.'s OFFICE AND SAID WENDY PARKS AND KEEGAN WORKED OUT A PLEA DEAL, BUT ONLY IF PARKS SUPPORTED THE EXHUMATION."
00:31:29.054,00:31:35.310,"SO, GRIFFIN GETS OFF IF HE TESTIFIES AGAINST REBECCA, AND THE D.A."
00:31:35.310,00:31:36.395,YOU TWO CAN GO.
00:31:36.395,00:31:38.438,WAIT -- DON'T WE GET A PRIZE?
00:31:53.537,00:31:54.621,NO.
00:31:54.621,00:31:56.832,MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER WAY.
00:32:07.467,00:32:09.803,"SHE CAN LET HIM WALK FREE, JUST LIKE THAT? HOW IS THAT LEGAL?"
00:32:13.724,00:32:16.727,THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THAT DEAL IS TO GET HER TO RESCIND IT.
00:32:16.727,00:32:18.854,WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?
00:32:26.653,00:32:29.406,WE CAN'T LEAK ANYTHING TO THE PRESS.
00:32:29.406,00:32:30.616,YES.
00:32:30.616,00:32:32.534,WHAT IF I LEAK IT?
00:32:32.534,00:32:34.912,THE JUDGE WILL HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT.
00:32:34.912,00:32:37.372,I CAN JUST SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT A GAG ORDER IS.
00:32:37.372,00:32:38.832,BUT YOU DO.
00:32:38.832,00:32:41.251,"LET MY CLIENT SPEAK FOR HERSELF, MR. GIBBINS."
00:32:41.251,00:32:45.380,"SO, TELL ME AGAIN ABOUT THE NIGHT YOU AND GRIFFIN SLEPT TOGETHER."
00:32:50.719,00:32:52.763,"Parks: THEY VIOLATED THEIR OWN GAG ORDER, YOUR HONOR."
00:32:52.763,00:32:54.139,Keegan: AND SLANDERED MY CLIENT IN THE PROCESS.
00:32:54.139,00:32:55.933,MY CLIENT IS 21 YEARS OLD.
00:32:55.933,00:33:00.270,"SHE HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS DISOBEYING THE LAW OH, COME ON!"
00:33:00.270,00:33:06.819,IT'S A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF THE GAG ORDER AND A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO SUBVERT THE PLEA AGREEMENT THE D.A.
00:33:06.819,00:33:08.236,"YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FULL OF CRAP, MS. KEATING."
00:33:08.236,00:33:09.738,"Judge: SETTLE DOWN, MR. KEEGAN."
00:33:09.738,00:33:11.364,"MS. PARKS, WAS THERE A DEAL?"
00:33:11.364,00:33:17.036,"DUE TO MISS SUTTER'S CONVENIENT ACCUSATION THAT MR. O'REILLY RAPED HER, WE HAVE CEASED CONVERSATION ABOUT A PLEA."
00:33:17.036,00:33:18.789,BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID OF PUBLIC PRESSURE.
00:33:18.789,00:33:20.582,MY CLIENT IS ENTITLED TO THAT DEAL.
00:33:20.582,00:33:24.628,JUST LIKE HE WAS ENTITLED TO PHYSICALLY VIOLATE MY CLIENT'S BODY?
00:33:24.628,00:33:26.880,"THERE'S NO JURY HERE, MR. KEEGAN."
00:33:26.880,00:33:30.175,"MS. KEATING, I'M SANCTIONING YOU FOR THE GAG-ORDER VIOLATION."
00:33:30.175,00:33:35.305,"IF I FIND YOU INSTRUCTED YOUR CLIENT TO BREAK THE ORDER, I'LL ENSURE THE STATE BAR LAUNCHES A DISCIPLINARY HEARING."
00:33:35.305,00:33:37.223,WE'LL COOPERATE FULLY.
00:33:37.223,00:33:40.393,"NOW, REGARDING EXHUMATION."
00:33:50.195,00:33:56.910,A NEW MEDICAL EXAMINER OF MY CHOOSING WILL BE CONDUCTING A FULL EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL SECOND AUTOPSY.
00:33:56.910,00:33:59.705,NO MORE ARGUMENTS ABOUT MISSED EVIDENCE.
00:33:59.705,00:34:03.291,"AFTERWARDS, SEALED REPORTS WILL BE DELIVERED TO ALL PARTIES."
00:34:03.291,00:34:06.003,I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU.
00:34:06.003,00:34:08.588,THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRY AND TAKE THE EASY ROAD.
00:34:08.588,00:34:11.174,EXCUSE ME?
00:34:11.174,00:34:16.304,YOU JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER TO CONVICT THE TOWNIE SLUT RATHER THAN THE VIRGIN QUARTERBACK.
00:34:16.304,00:34:17.890,OR I JUST KNOW YOUR CLIENT DID IT.
00:34:17.890,00:34:20.559,I'D SAY A PRAYER THOSE AREN'T HER NAILS ON THAT POOR GIRL'S NECK.
00:34:20.559,00:34:21.935,PRAYERS ARE FOR THE WEAK.
00:34:21.935,00:34:24.396,I'LL STICK TO BEATING YOUR ASS IN COURT.
00:34:29.693,00:34:31.069,HEY.
00:34:32.111,00:34:33.780,HEY!
00:34:33.780,00:34:35.699,YOU DIDN'T WAIT FOR ME AT THE COURTHOUSE.
00:34:35.699,00:34:38.451,I HAVE TO STUDY.
00:34:38.451,00:34:40.662,I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
00:34:45.751,00:34:47.878,SERIOUSLY?
00:34:51.965,00:34:54.843,WOW. REALLY?
00:34:54.843,00:34:57.888,OKAY.
00:34:57.888,00:35:00.223,"YOU ARE SUCH A GUY RIGHT NOW, I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF IMPRESSED."
00:35:03.101,00:35:08.147,WHO -- YOU THINK I'M MESSED UP?
00:35:08.147,00:35:09.942,YOU'RE THE ONE WITH NO LIFE.
00:35:09.942,00:35:11.610,"OTHERWISE, WHY GET SO OBSESSED WITH MINE?"
00:35:11.610,00:35:13.361,WHO MADE YOU THIS WAY?
00:35:13.361,00:35:15.405,WAS SHE AN ALCOHOLIC AND YOU MISS THE DRAMA?
00:35:15.405,00:35:17.532,DID YOUR DAD HIT HER?
00:35:17.532,00:35:21.119,"I MEAN, WHO MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT AN ACTUAL PERSON UNLESS YOU ARE FIXING SOMEONE ELSE'S MESS?"
00:35:21.119,00:35:23.538,I'M NOT TRYING TO FIX YOU.
00:35:23.538,00:35:26.207,"BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT, I'LL STOP."
00:35:26.207,00:35:30.295,"YOU CAN LIE ON THE STAND, CALL PEOPLE RAPISTS -- WHATEVER YOU WANT."
00:35:30.295,00:35:33.048,JUST DON'T SAY I'M MESSED UP BECAUSE I WANTED TO HELP YOU.
00:35:45.769,00:35:48.605,WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS.
00:35:48.605,00:35:50.398,YOU'RE RIGHT.
00:36:52.627,00:36:55.005,YOU WERE BORN IN OHIO.
00:37:00.719,00:37:02.762,I LOOKED IT UP.

00:37:07.600,00:37:10.353,EXCEPT FOR THE DOPEY SMILE YOU HAVE ON YOUR FACE ALL THE TIME.
00:37:14.273,00:37:18.444,I WASN'T BORN IN OHIO.
00:37:18.444,00:37:22.323,MY MOM MOVED US HERE WHEN I WAS 1.
00:37:24.826,00:37:28.663,I WAS THE ONLY BLACK KID IN OUR TOWN.
00:37:28.663,00:37:31.917,"EVERYONE WANTED ME TO BE GOOD AT BASKETBALL, BUT I SUCKED."
00:37:38.381,00:37:40.425,I'M ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS.
00:37:40.425,00:37:42.719,I HAVE A REALLY BAD SENSE OF DIRECTION.
00:37:42.719,00:37:44.679,MY MOM KILLED HERSELF WHEN I WAS 12.
00:37:44.679,00:37:46.806,"I HATE SUPERHERO MOVIES 'CAUSE I -- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA."
00:37:46.806,00:37:48.100,WES.
00:37:51.811,00:37:53.772,SHE WAS SWEET...
00:37:53.772,00:37:54.856,FUNNY.
00:37:57.483,00:37:59.360,"MESSED UP, TOO."
00:38:01.654,00:38:02.906,IT SUCKED.
00:38:04.866,00:38:07.577,MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM IS MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP.
00:38:07.577,00:38:09.871,I'VE NEVER BEEN TO EUROPE.
00:38:09.871,00:38:11.873,I'M AFRAID OF HEIGHTS.
00:38:11.873,00:38:16.128,"SOMEDAY, I WANT A DOG, BUT NOT FROM A BREEDER -- THE POUND."

00:38:47.742,00:38:51.370,"HEY, I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE -- I'M SURE."
00:38:51.370,00:38:56.042,"LOOK, IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE GUY AT ALL, DON'T EVER COME BACK HERE."
00:39:02.757,00:39:04.759,Frank: HEY.

00:39:33.746,00:39:34.873,REALLY?
00:39:34.873,00:39:38.126,YOU MEAN THAT?
00:39:39.836,00:39:43.215,OF COURSE I DON'T MEAN IT.
00:39:43.215,00:39:46.343,I THINK ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME.
00:39:46.343,00:39:48.887,BUT I'LL GET OVER IT.

00:41:10.218,00:41:12.220,LET'S GO TO SLEEP.
00:41:26.109,00:41:28.903,IT'S BONNIE.
00:41:38.704,00:41:42.459,I JUST GOT A CALL FROM MY CONTACT AT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE.
00:41:42.459,00:41:45.128,THE MARKS ON LILA'S NECK WEREN'T FINGERNAILS.
00:41:45.128,00:41:46.338,THEY'RE ANT BITES.

00:42:02.728,00:42:05.606,LILA WAS SIX WEEKS PREGNANT.
00:00:05.881,00:00:07.967,PREVIOUSLY ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER...
00:00:07.967,00:00:11.428,A WOMAN'S BODY WAS FOUND INSIDE THE KAPPA KAPPA THETA HOUSE.
00:00:11.428,00:00:13.472,WHAT'S WRONG?
00:00:13.472,00:00:16.266,I'M ORDERING MISS STANGARD'S BODY BE EXHUMED IMMEDIATELY.
00:00:16.266,00:00:19.269,A FULL EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL SECOND AUTOPSY.
00:00:19.269,00:00:21.396,I THINK ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME.
00:00:21.396,00:00:23.064,WHAT IF I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET OVER IT?
00:00:24.775,00:00:27.277,WE REPRESENT MARY WALKER.

00:00:30.155,00:00:32.032,THEY MISSED SOMETHING IN THE FIRST AUTOPSY.
00:00:32.032,00:00:34.994,SAY IT.
00:00:56.974,00:01:07.693,"WHAT IF IT'S TOO BIG -- LIKE, I WAITED TOO LONG, AND NOW MY BODY ASSUMES I'M SOME SORT OF NUN WHO'LL NEVER HAVE SEX, AND THEN WHEN I FINALLY DO IT OR...TRY..."
00:01:07.693,00:01:09.403,HE WON'T FIT?
00:01:09.403,00:01:11.488,I'VE MET GRIFFIN.
00:01:11.488,00:01:14.282,"JUDGING BY THE CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER, I'M GUESSING IT'LL FIT."
00:01:14.282,00:01:17.912,WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR VIRGINITY PACT?
00:01:17.912,00:01:20.330,DID GRIFFIN FINALLY REALIZE GOD DOESN'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT HIS SEX LIFE?
00:01:23.417,00:01:25.502,"IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING, SWEAR YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE?"
00:01:27.963,00:01:29.631,I DON'T WANT TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS MORE THAN YOU.
00:01:33.844,00:01:35.345,I MET A NEW GUY.
00:01:36.513,00:01:39.892,WHO?
00:01:41.226,00:01:43.604,I PROMISED I WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE WHO HE WAS.
00:01:43.604,00:01:45.480,SO HE'S ONE OF GRIFFIN'S FRIENDS?
00:01:45.480,00:01:47.858,NO.
00:01:49.401,00:01:50.861,HE HAS A WIFE.
00:01:52.029,00:01:53.072,"OH. OH, MY GOD."
00:01:57.534,00:02:00.203,LILA WAS SIX WEEKS PREGNANT.
00:02:07.669,00:02:08.712,I'LL LEAVE.
00:02:08.712,00:02:12.049,NO. STAY.
00:02:12.049,00:02:16.511,I NEED A WITNESS HERE TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T LIE TO ME AGAIN.
00:02:28.565,00:02:31.110,YOU LIED WHEN YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T SLEEP WITH HER.
00:02:31.110,00:02:34.446,YOU LIED WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE AT YALE THE NIGHT SHE WAS KILLED.
00:02:34.446,00:02:36.824,"AND I BELIEVED YOU, LIKE SOME FOOL."
00:02:36.824,00:02:39.701,SO...
00:02:39.701,00:02:41.745,DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS PREGNANT?
00:02:41.745,00:02:43.288,NO.
00:02:43.288,00:02:48.502,"NO BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T OR NO BECAUSE IF YOU SAY YES, YOU KNOW THAT'S MOTIVE TO KILL?"
00:02:48.502,00:02:50.629,THIS IS...
00:02:48.502,00:02:52.213,NOT SOMETHING THAT -- DO NOT LEAVE!
00:02:57.427,00:03:00.472,ARE YOU LYING?
00:03:00.472,00:03:03.308,WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S MINE.
00:03:05.602,00:03:07.562,HE CLAIMS TO BE A VIRGIN.
00:03:07.562,00:03:11.025,"WAS LILA, THE FIRST TIME YOU HAD HER?"
00:03:11.025,00:03:13.068,"YOU WOULD KNOW, WOULDN'T YOU?"
00:03:19.407,00:03:21.200,I PROMISE YOU.
00:03:23.328,00:03:24.830,YOU BELIEVE HIM?
00:03:31.628,00:03:33.547,SHOULD'VE WORN A CONDOM.
00:03:44.683,00:03:55.194,"SOMETIMES, WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR OWN ACTIONS, BECAUSE SOMETIMES, WE BEHAVE NOT LIKE THINKING, THOUGHTFUL HUMAN BEINGS, BUT AS ANIMALS."
00:03:55.194,00:04:02.367,"SUCH IS THE CASE OF GRETCHEN THOMAS, A SUCCESSFUL REAL-ESTATE AGENT, WIFE, MOTHER."
00:04:02.367,00:04:11.292,"LIKE MANY A HIGH-POWERED PROFESSIONAL, STRESS AND ANXIETY ARE PART OF HER DAILY ROUTINE, SO SHE TAKES A PRESCRIPTION SLEEPING PILL BEFORE BED."
00:04:11.292,00:04:21.511,"ITS SIDE EFFECTS HAVE CAUSED HER TO BUY CLOTHES ONLINE, COOK GOURMET MEALS, AND EVEN INITIATE SEX WITH HER HUSBAND, ALL WHILE COMPLETELY UNCONSCIOUS."
00:04:21.511,00:04:23.138,AND THEN THIS HAPPENED.
00:04:26.767,00:04:34.357,"THIS IS MS. THOMAS ON HER HOME-SECURITY SYSTEM, DRAGGING HER NANNY'S DEAD, BLOODY BODY OUT OF THE HOUSE."
00:04:34.357,00:04:36.735,AND THEN WHAT DOES SHE DO?
00:04:36.735,00:04:40.239,SHE BEGINS TO CLEAN UP THE MESS.
00:04:51.875,00:04:55.295,Gretchen: I'M SORRY THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO GET TO YOUR OFFICE.
00:04:55.295,00:04:59.549,"IT'S MIA'S 13th BIRTHDAY THIS WEEKEND, AND PLANNING HAS BEEN CRAZY."
00:04:59.549,00:05:01.885,WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT IT'D BE SO DIFFICULT TO FIND A DEEJAY?
00:05:01.885,00:05:04.096,WE REALLY NEED YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.
00:05:04.096,00:05:06.181,OH! FINALLY!
00:05:06.181,00:05:08.391,RICARDO?
00:05:08.391,00:05:10.685,HI. I AM SO HAPPY THAT YOU CALLED.
00:05:10.685,00:05:18.110,"NOW, I KNOW YOU USUALLY DON'T DO KIDS' PARTIES, BUT I'M GOING TO PRISON ANY MINUTE, This could take a while."
00:05:16.191,00:05:20.237,AND THIS COULD BE THE LAST CHANCE Want to sneak upstairs?
00:05:20.237,00:05:23.364,"NO, NO. I'M SURE DJ RIZZLES IS VERY TALENTED."
00:05:23.364,00:05:28.954,IT'S JUST THAT YOU HAVE COME SO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FROM MY FRIEND KAREN'S -- YOU'RE ON TRIAL FOR FIRST-DEGREE MURDER.
00:05:28.954,00:05:31.748,PUT THE PHONE DOWN SO WE CAN PREP FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.
00:05:31.748,00:05:33.500,I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.
00:05:33.500,00:05:35.210,I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE STAND.
00:05:35.210,00:05:37.587,"HONEY, THIS ISN'T JUST YOUR DECISION."
00:05:37.587,00:05:40.257,"YOU HAVE A FAMILY WHO NEEDS YOU, CHILDREN WHO NEED YOU."
00:05:40.257,00:05:42.383,"IF SHE WANTS TO GO TO JAIL, DAD, LET HER."
00:05:42.383,00:05:45.262,"YOUR MOTHER IS NOT GOING TO JAIL, CODY."
00:05:47.055,00:05:54.646,"GRETCHEN, I UNDERSTAND THIS IS DIFFICULT FOR YOU, BUT AS YOUR ATTORNEY, I NEED TO PUT YOU ON THE STAND SO I CAN ESTABLISH THAT YOU HAD NO MOTIVE TO KILL ELKE."
00:05:54.646,00:05:57.024,THE JURY NEEDS TO BELIEVE THAT YOU TWO WERE CLOSE.
00:05:57.024,00:05:58.317,WE WERE CLOSE.
00:05:58.317,00:06:04.281,CAN YOU IMAGINE WAKING UP TO REALIZE THAT YOU KILLED SOMEBODY YOU LOVED?
00:06:04.281,00:06:07.159,THAT'S WHAT I DID.
00:06:07.159,00:06:11.079,"IF THE JURY THINKS THAT I SHOULD GO TO PRISON, I AGREE."
00:06:11.079,00:06:13.081,I SHOULD PAY FOR THIS SIN.
00:06:16.168,00:06:23.300,"Bonnie: SINCE WE CAN'T PUT GRETCHEN ON THE STAND, WE'RE HAVING THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE HER -- HER FAMILY -- TESTIFY TO HER HISTORY OF SLEEPWALKING."
00:06:23.300,00:06:29.556,"SO TOMORROW, EACH OF YOU WILL ACT AS PROSECUTORS, PREPPING EACH OF THE THOMASES FOR THEIR MOMENT IN THE SUN."
00:06:29.556,00:06:31.474,DIG IN.
00:06:31.474,00:06:33.810,ANYONE ELSE FEEL LIKE WE DO ALL HER WORK FOR HER?
00:06:33.810,00:06:35.270,JUST FIGURING THAT OUT NOW?
00:06:35.270,00:06:42.069,"I WAS FINE WITH IT BEFORE EXAMS, BUT NOW THAT EVERYONE ELSE IN OUR CLASS IS LOCKED AWAY IN THEIR APARTMENTS, STUDYING, WE'RE FALLING BEHIND, WORKING AS FREE LABOR."
00:06:42.069,00:06:43.862,YOU KNOW WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT EXAMS?
00:06:43.862,00:06:45.739,THIS GUY.
00:06:43.862,00:06:48.533,"'CAUSE I GOT -- MENTION THE TROPHY AGAIN, AND I'LL BASH YOUR FACE IN WITH IT."
00:06:48.533,00:06:50.369,"OKAY, WHATEVER, SHOOTING STAR."
00:06:50.369,00:06:52.287,"YOU GUYS ALL GO BE BORING, STUDY."
00:06:52.287,00:06:58.585,"I'LL BE AT THE BONFIRE, PARTYING IT UP, MACKIN' ON THE CHICKADEES!"
00:06:58.585,00:07:00.461,YOU WANT TO STUDY-GROUP THIS WEEKEND?
00:07:02.421,00:07:05.592,"WELL, YOU TAKE NOTES, I HAVE ADDERALL."

00:07:23.651,00:07:25.070,PREGNANT?
00:07:25.070,00:07:26.821,SIX WEEKS.
00:07:26.821,00:07:31.159,"THERE WAS NO SIGN OF SEXUAL TRAUMA IN THE FIRST AUTOPSY, SO THEY DIDN'T INSPECT THE UTERUS."
00:07:31.159,00:07:40.668,"IT'LL BE A FEW MORE DAYS BEFORE THE POLICE RELEASE THE FINAL REPORT, BUT THE MINUTE THEY DO, THEY'LL RUN A DNA TEST ON GRIFFIN TO SEE IF HE WAS THE FATHER."
00:07:42.087,00:07:44.256,"HE'S NOT, AS WE BOTH KNOW."
00:07:52.222,00:07:55.516,BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU DIDN'T TELL HER.
00:07:56.935,00:07:58.561,WHY NOT?
00:07:58.561,00:08:04.901,"WELL, BECAUSE IF SHE FINDS OUT DAYS BEFORE HER TRIAL, I'M AFRAID SHE'LL ACT OUT IN A WAY THAT WILL HURT HER CASE."
00:08:06.069,00:08:11.366,"SO, FOR HER BENEFIT, I'M ASKING YOU NOT TO TELL HER."
00:08:11.366,00:08:13.952,"IF YOU DIDN'T WANT HER TO KNOW, WHY TELL ME?"
00:08:16.371,00:08:20.583,BECAUSE I LEARNED MY LESSON ABOUT KEEPING SECRETS FROM YOU.
00:08:25.588,00:08:26.840,OKAY.
00:08:28.049,00:08:29.592,THANK YOU.
00:08:30.844,00:08:32.262,Wes: LILA WAS PREGNANT.

00:08:45.775,00:08:48.445,"WHAT -- YOU BELIEVE HER, WITH HER HUSBAND FREAKIN' INVOLVED?"
00:08:48.445,00:08:50.571,I'M NOT SURE.
00:08:50.571,00:08:52.573,BUT...
00:08:52.573,00:08:54.826,SHE KNOWS I COULD GO TO THE POLICE AT ANY POINT.
00:08:54.826,00:08:56.911,SO LET'S. WE'LL TELL THEM THE BABY'S SAM'S.
00:08:56.911,00:08:59.539,WHAT IF IT'S NOT?
00:08:59.539,00:09:02.376,WHAT IF HE HAS AN ALIBI?
00:09:02.376,00:09:05.462,"YOU'RE STILL ON TRIAL, BUT WITHOUT ANNALISE."
00:09:05.462,00:09:06.754,"SO, WHAT?"
00:09:06.754,00:09:08.548,"I MEAN, WE -- WE DO NOTHING?"
00:09:09.590,00:09:10.717,OF COURSE NOT.
00:09:10.717,00:09:13.512,I...
00:09:13.512,00:09:17.640,I JUST NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER TILL WE FIGURE OUT OUR NEXT STEP.
00:09:38.161,00:09:41.081,IT'S NOT SAFE TO BE OUT HERE ALONE.
00:09:41.081,00:09:43.208,WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU?
00:09:43.208,00:09:46.545,"I WANT TO GET ACQUITTED, BUT YOU -- WHY DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME?"
00:09:46.545,00:09:49.130,I LOST MY JOB BECAUSE OF THIS CASE.
00:09:49.130,00:09:53.260,"SO, REALLY, THIS IS JUST ME HELPING MYSELF."
00:09:53.260,00:09:55.262,SO...
00:09:55.262,00:09:57.013,WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME?
00:09:58.848,00:10:01.017,LILA...WAS PREGNANT.
00:10:03.520,00:10:06.981,"THAT'S THE EVIDENCE WE NEED, RIGHT, TO TIE SAM TO HER?"
00:10:06.981,00:10:10.277,YOU STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE HOUSE?
00:10:10.277,00:10:13.154,GRAB A SAMPLE OF HIS HAIR FROM THE BATHROOM.
00:10:13.154,00:10:16.241,I'LL HAVE SOMEONE AT THE STATION RUN A DNA TEST.
00:10:16.241,00:10:19.827,"IF IT MATCHES THE BABY, THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO START AN INVESTIGATION ON HIM."
00:10:19.827,00:10:22.456,AND YOUR CASE...
00:10:24.249,00:10:26.167,YOU IN?
00:10:40.098,00:10:41.516,"HEY, LOSER."
00:10:41.516,00:10:45.395,"ALL RIGHT, SOME COKE, SOME MOLLY."
00:10:45.395,00:10:47.105,UH...WHAT?
00:10:48.356,00:10:49.857,WE DID IT.
00:10:49.857,00:10:52.068,AH.
00:10:52.068,00:10:55.614,"I'M GUESSING IT DIDN'T HURT, BY THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE."
00:10:55.614,00:10:58.492,IT'S NOT LIKE HOW ALL MY FRIENDS TALK ABOUT THEIR FIRST TIME.
00:10:58.492,00:11:05.873,"YOU KNOW, HE...DIDN'T RUSH OR ACT WEIRD OR MAKE ME FEEL WEIRD."
00:11:05.873,00:11:07.959,HE MADE ME FEEL SAFE.
00:11:09.919,00:11:11.338,YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT.
00:11:11.338,00:11:13.214,YOU SAID IT.
00:11:13.214,00:11:20.263,"WELL, I WILL SAY THIS -- HIS WIFE MUST NEVER PUT OUT, BECAUSE ONCE WE REALLY STARTED GOING, IT WAS LIKE HE COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF ME."
00:11:20.263,00:11:24.184,SWEAR YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE?
00:11:24.184,00:11:27.187,"OH, LIKE I CARE ENOUGH ABOUT YOUR STUPID SEX LIFE TO TELL ANYONE."
00:11:27.187,00:11:29.856,THANKS.
00:11:29.856,00:11:31.149,"OH, MY GOD."
00:11:31.149,00:11:32.359,WHAT?
00:11:37.197,00:11:41.242,WOW. WELL...NOW I KNOW WHY YOU THOUGHT IT'D HURT.
00:11:41.242,00:11:42.410,OOH!
00:11:45.330,00:11:47.832,"WHAT'S UP, DARCY?"
00:11:49.750,00:11:51.294,ANNALISE ISN'T HERE.
00:11:51.294,00:11:52.504,COURT -- I KNOW.
00:11:52.504,00:11:57.634,"I THINK I LEFT MY GLOVES HERE -- GREENISH, 10 FINGERS."
00:12:00.470,00:12:02.180,NOT GONNA STEAL ANYTHING.
00:12:03.473,00:12:04.849,'COURSE NOT.
00:12:06.893,00:12:10.230,MUST'VE FALLEN OUT...
00:12:15.068,00:12:17.362,NOT HERE.
00:12:17.362,00:12:20.114,I'M A DISASTER.
00:12:21.658,00:12:23.451,HMM.
00:12:23.451,00:12:25.161,CAN I USE YOUR BATHROOM?
00:12:25.161,00:12:26.371,REBECCA.
00:12:28.456,00:12:33.169,"DUDE, I'M NOT -- YOU'RE WELCOME HERE WHEN ANNALISE INVITES YOU."
00:12:33.169,00:12:34.879,"OTHERWISE, THIS IS MY HOUSE."
00:12:34.879,00:12:36.548,AND I'M ASKING YOU TO LEAVE.
00:12:39.509,00:12:40.759,YEAH.
00:12:45.890,00:12:47.350,"NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO."
00:12:53.147,00:12:57.485,Cody: IT WAS A BLOODBATH -- A WHOLE TRAIL OF IT LEADING OUTSIDE.
00:12:57.485,00:13:00.447,"AND MOM JUST STOOD THERE, HOSING THE BLOOD OFF ELKE."
00:13:00.447,00:13:02.156,SO YOUR MOM WAS AWAKE WHEN YOU FOUND HER?
00:13:02.156,00:13:04.033,NO. SHE WAS ASLEEP.
00:13:04.033,00:13:05.201,I STARTED YELLING FOR MY DAD.
00:13:05.201,00:13:09.956,"Wes: SO, LET'S BE CLEAR -- YOU ACTUALLY SAW HER TAKE THE SLEEPING PILL THAT NIGHT?"
00:13:09.956,00:13:12.500,"NO, BUT SHE TOLD ME SHE TOOK IT WHEN WE GOT INTO BED."
00:13:12.500,00:13:14.127,THEN HOW CAN YOU BE CERTAIN?
00:13:14.127,00:13:16.879,BECAUSE SHE TOOK IT EVERY NIGHT -- RIGHT BEFORE WE WENT TO SLEEP.
00:13:16.879,00:13:18.548,Claire: LIKE A DRUG ADDICT.
00:13:18.548,00:13:23.219,"I TOLD HER, YOU WOULDN'T NEED A PILL TO SLEEP IF YOU JUST SLOWED DOWN."
00:13:23.219,00:13:26.765,SOUNDS LIKE THE PERFECT RECIPE FOR YOUR DAUGHTER TO SNAP -- MAYBE EVEN KILL.
00:13:26.765,00:13:28.767,OBJECTION -- ARGUMENTATIVE.
00:13:28.767,00:13:31.018,UH...
00:13:31.018,00:13:33.020,YOU DIDN'T ASK AN ACTUAL QUESTION.
00:13:33.020,00:13:35.982,THE OPPOSING LAWYER WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO OBJECT.
00:13:37.108,00:13:39.068,I WATCH COURT TV.
00:13:39.068,00:13:40.819,Mia: GRANDMA HATED ELKE.
00:13:45.366,00:13:47.076,DON'T SAY THAT PART ON THE STAND.
00:13:47.076,00:13:50.538,WE DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK YOUR GRANDMOTHER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.
00:13:50.538,00:13:52.332,MAYBE SHE DID.
00:13:54.959,00:13:57.378,LOOK IN THE MEDICINE CABINET IN THEIR BATHROOM.
00:13:57.378,00:14:03.884,"IT'S A VERITABLE DRUGSTORE IN THERE -- ANTIANXIETY MEDS FOR MIA, HAIR-GROWTH SUPPLEMENTS FOR MATTHEW."
00:14:03.884,00:14:06.304,DOES THAT MEAN YOU DON'T TRUST YOUR DAUGHTER'S JUDGMENT?
00:14:06.304,00:14:08.431,OF COURSE I TRUST HER.
00:14:08.431,00:14:10.350,THEN ACT LIKE IT.
00:14:10.350,00:14:14.103,"SHOW A SLIVER OF DOUBT OR DISTRUST, AND THE PROSECUTION WILL POUNCE."
00:14:14.103,00:14:16.356,"...ON TOP OF ME, INITIATING SEX."
00:14:16.356,00:14:17.982,"ALL THE WHILE, SHE'S COMPLETELY ASLEEP."
00:14:17.982,00:14:19.734,THAT'S HOW MUCH THOSE PILLS KNOCK HER OUT.
00:14:19.734,00:14:23.446,"UH, MAYBE DON'T...USE THE SEX AS AN EXAMPLE ON THE STAND."
00:14:23.446,00:14:25.906,Connor: WHEN DID YOUR MOM FINALLY COME TO?
00:14:25.906,00:14:29.952,"UH, ONCE MY DAD PUT HER IN THE SHOWER, RAN COLD WATER ON HER."
00:14:29.952,00:14:31.996,IT WAS THE ONLY WAY WE COULD WAKE HER UP.
00:14:31.996,00:14:34.290,WHAT WAS HER REACTION WHEN SHE REALIZED WHAT SHE'D DONE?
00:14:34.290,00:14:37.293,"SHE STARTED CRYING, YELLING."
00:14:37.293,00:14:40.547,IT WAS AWFUL -- FOR ALL OF US.
00:14:40.547,00:14:42.757,"LIKE, IT'S ONE THING FOR YOUR MOM TO KILL YOUR NANNY..."
00:14:42.757,00:14:45.926,IT'S A WHOLE OTHER THING IF SHE HAD NO IDEA WHAT SHE WAS DOING.
00:14:45.926,00:14:51.307,"IT SOUNDS FAKE -- I KNOW -- LIKE WE'RE MAKING IT UP, BUT WE'RE NOT."
00:14:51.307,00:14:52.684,IT'S THE PILL'S FAULT.
00:14:53.727,00:14:54.935,YOUR WITNESS.
00:14:56.896,00:15:00.941,"IS IT POSSIBLE YOUR PARENTS TOLD YOU TO LIE ON THE STAND TODAY, CODY?"
00:15:00.941,00:15:03.695,"YOUR HONOR, THERE'S NO GOOD-FAITH BASIS TO THIS QUESTION."
00:15:03.695,00:15:06.573,LET ME REPHRASE.
00:15:06.573,00:15:09.743,DO YOU LOVE YOUR MOTHER?
00:15:09.743,00:15:11.952,SO YOU'D DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT HER.
00:15:11.952,00:15:13.454,"LIE, EVEN?"
00:15:13.454,00:15:14.831,"HE'S BADGERING MY WITNESS, YOUR HONOR."
00:15:14.831,00:15:16.916,"LYING UNDER OATH IS ILLEGAL, CODY."
00:15:16.916,00:15:18.835,"MR. RODRIGUEZ, THIS IS BORDERING ON WITNESS INTIMIDATION."
00:15:18.835,00:15:20.879,"ARE YOU LYING, CODY?"
00:15:24.048,00:15:25.299,I'M NOT LYING ABOUT MY MOTHER.
00:15:25.299,00:15:27.385,SHE LOVED ELKE.
00:15:27.385,00:15:30.388,ESPECIALLY ME.
00:15:30.388,00:15:32.599,WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?
00:15:32.599,00:15:34.183,"YOUR HONOR, HE'S JUST A YOUNG BOY."
00:15:34.183,00:15:35.769,I LOVED HER.
00:15:35.769,00:15:40.732,"THAT'S WHY I WAS AWAKE AT 3:00 A.M. THAT NIGHT -- BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO HER ROOM, JUST LIKE I HAD BEEN EVERY NIGHT."
00:15:42.191,00:15:44.068,WE LOVED EACH OTHER.
00:15:52.993,00:15:55.496,"Damn it, Aiden! You want me to write a script for you?"
00:15:55.496,00:16:04.171,"Uh, how about, Mother, You should've told me you were giving Michaela a prenup, and as her fiancé, I fully support her decision not to sign it."
00:16:04.171,00:16:05.465,I GOT TO GO.
00:16:08.384,00:16:12.972,"ARE YOU GOOD FOR ANYTHING, OR CAN YOU ONLY DO YOUR JOB WHEN YOU'RE SCREWING EVIDENCE OUT OF SOMEONE?"
00:16:12.972,00:16:15.767,"ANNALISE, HE DID HIS BEST."
00:16:15.767,00:16:17.435,"NO, YOU WERE BLINDSIDED."
00:16:17.435,00:16:19.395,BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO YOUR ONE SIMPLE JOB.
00:16:19.395,00:16:20.939,TELL ME WHAT'S COMING MY WAY!
00:16:20.939,00:16:24.233,THAT'S ALL I ASK.
00:16:36.496,00:16:41.626,HOW'S IT FEEL TO HAVE YOUR ASS HANDED TO YOU JUST DAYS BEFORE SHE HANDS OUT OUR FINAL GRADES?
00:16:43.503,00:16:50.844,"I'm not worried, because I got a copy of the exam that she gave last year."
00:16:50.844,00:16:55.181,AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE IT WITH MY NEW STUDY GROUP IF THEY HAVE THINGS TO GIVE ME IN RETURN.
00:16:55.181,00:16:57.308,I'LL TRADE YOU ALL MY NOTES.
00:16:57.308,00:16:59.477,AND I'LL GIVE YOU COPIES OF ALL OF KAN'S OLD OUTLINES.
00:16:59.477,00:17:02.856,I HAVE EVERY CRIMINAL-LAW HORNBOOK EVER WRITTEN.
00:17:02.856,00:17:07.067,I THINK THREE PEOPLE'S ENOUGH FOR THIS STUDY GROUP.
00:17:07.067,00:17:09.696,THIS IS SO GOOD.
00:17:15.284,00:17:17.578,HELLO?
00:17:17.578,00:17:19.413,FRANK: You like the photo?
00:17:19.413,00:17:21.332,I SNUCK IT WHILE YOU WERE IN THE SHOWER THIS MORNING.
00:17:21.332,00:17:23.668,WES WAS SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO ME.
00:17:23.668,00:17:24.669,I know.
00:17:24.669,00:17:26.253,MAKES IT MORE FUN.
00:17:26.253,00:17:28.214,WHAT DO YOU WANT?
00:17:28.214,00:17:29.590,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:17:48.526,00:17:50.737,"SLOW DOWN, KILLER."
00:17:50.737,00:17:53.948,"IF I'M GONE FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES, BONNIE WILL GET SUSPICIOUS."
00:17:53.948,00:17:55.867,BONNIE WAS BORN SUSPICIOUS.
00:17:55.867,00:17:57.911,I WANT TO TAKE MY TIME.
00:18:14.510,00:18:16.387,"HEY, THAT WAS BULL DONKS, YO."
00:18:16.387,00:18:18.973,A.K. REAMING YOU OUT LIKE THAT -- IT'S NOT RIGHT.
00:18:18.973,00:18:21.601,"I MEAN, WE ALL KNOW WHO DESERVES THE CREDIT AROUND HERE."
00:18:21.601,00:18:23.394,YOU'RE SUCKING UP.
00:18:23.394,00:18:26.355,"NO, I'M JUST SAYING DON'T LET IT GET TO YOU."
00:18:26.355,00:18:29.734,"SHE'S THE ONE THAT SUCKS, NOT YOU."
00:18:29.734,00:18:32.904,"ALSO, I'M HAVING A LITTLE JAMMY-JAM AT MY PLACE TOMORROW BEFORE THE BONFIRE."
00:18:32.904,00:18:35.364,"DRINKS, PRETTY PEEPS -- THE USHE."
00:18:35.364,00:18:37.658,SO I WAS HOPING I COULD GET OFF A LITTLE EARLY TOMORROW.
00:18:37.658,00:18:40.536,"YOU CAN COME, TOO -- SHAKE YOUR GROOVE THANG."
00:18:40.536,00:18:43.247,YOU CAN GO HOME EARLY AS LONG AS YOU GET ALL YOUR WORK DONE.
00:18:52.465,00:18:53.591,SAM.
00:18:53.591,00:18:55.509,I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
00:18:55.509,00:18:58.554,IT'S ABOUT LILA.
00:18:58.554,00:19:02.600,"THE NIGHT SHE WAS KILLED, I THOUGHT YOU WERE AT YALE."
00:19:02.600,00:19:09.315,BUT I -- DID YOU NEED ME?
00:19:26.040,00:19:28.167,REBECCA CAME BY THE HOUSE.
00:19:28.167,00:19:31.253,CLAIMS SHE WAS LOOKING FOR HER GLOVES.
00:19:36.300,00:19:38.177,THERE'S NOT A CHANCE SHE KNOWS ABOUT THE PREGNANCY?
00:19:38.177,00:19:40.179,WES IS HERE ALL THE TIME.
00:19:40.179,00:19:42.264,I ALREADY TOLD WES.
00:19:42.264,00:19:43.933,SO HE TOLD HER.
00:19:45.559,00:19:46.894,YOU KNOW HOW HE FEELS ABOUT HER.
00:19:48.146,00:19:49.522,YEAH.
00:19:49.522,00:19:51.607,"THAT'S SWEET, ISN'T IT?"
00:19:54.276,00:20:01.492,TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO HERE -- IF YOU WANT ME TO GO TO THE POLICE.
00:20:03.828,00:20:05.538,DON'T GIVE UP ON ME HERE.
00:20:07.915,00:20:10.250,I'M GONNA LOSE MY CASE.
00:20:13.129,00:20:16.883,BECAUSE ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS YOU WITH THAT GIRL.
00:20:16.883,00:20:19.426,HOW MANY TIMES WAS IT?
00:20:22.805,00:20:24.974,THAT'S ALL IT TOOK FOR YOU TO KNOCK HER UP?
00:20:29.103,00:20:31.522,THIS IS WHAT I GET.
00:20:35.151,00:20:39.697,THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SCREW SOMEBODY ELSE'S HUSBAND.
00:20:40.698,00:20:43.325,"YOU BECOME SAD, BARREN."
00:20:45.161,00:20:48.414,AND EVEN A DEAD GIRL IS MORE OF A WOMAN THAN YOU.
00:20:48.414,00:20:49.957,THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS.
00:20:49.957,00:20:50.917,IT IS.
00:20:50.917,00:20:51.918,NO.
00:20:51.918,00:20:53.878,"NO, ANNIE, THIS..."
00:20:57.339,00:20:58.591,THIS IS ME.
00:20:58.591,00:21:00.300,SO...
00:21:00.300,00:21:05.305,"GET PISSED OFF, HIT ME IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES."
00:21:05.305,00:21:08.350,"BUT I BROKE US, NOT YOU."
00:21:08.350,00:21:13.231,AND I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE US RIGHT AGAIN.
00:21:25.451,00:21:27.620,SO...
00:21:27.620,00:21:35.169,"EITHER I'M ALREADY HIGH OR SCHOOL STARTED AGAIN, 'CAUSE I SWEAR I JUST WALKED BY A BUNCH OF GIRLS HALF-NAKED DOWNSTAIRS, PRACTICING A MILEY CYRUS DANCE ROUTINE."
00:21:39.715,00:21:41.675,DARCY WANTS TO END IT.
00:21:43.594,00:21:45.805,I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.
00:21:45.805,00:21:49.308,THEY NEVER LEAVE THEIR WIVES.
00:21:49.308,00:21:50.977,BUT YOU HOPED HE WOULD.
00:21:50.977,00:21:54.230,TELL ME IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.
00:21:54.230,00:21:56.398,GRIFFIN STILL HASN'T FOUND OUT.
00:21:56.398,00:21:59.110,YOU SAID YOU WERE BREAKING UP WITH GRIFFIN.
00:22:01.028,00:22:05.199,"LILA, HE'S A JESUS-OBSESSED CONTROL FREAK WHO FORCED YOU INTO A VIRGINITY PACT."
00:22:05.199,00:22:06.659,HE WAS RIGHT.
00:22:08.368,00:22:10.621,BAD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU HAVE SEX.
00:22:10.621,00:22:12.581,LIKE WHAT?
00:22:18.337,00:22:20.965,I-I DON'T KNOW.
00:22:20.965,00:22:22.842,"JUST, LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT."
00:22:25.136,00:22:26.262,"UM, YEAH, OKAY."
00:22:26.262,00:22:27.513,I'LL GO.
00:22:28.597,00:22:30.724,STAY.
00:22:42.528,00:22:51.871,IS IT SICK IF ALL I WANT TO DO IS GO OVER TO HIS HOUSE AND SHOW HIS WIFE ALL THE PICTURES OF HIS JUNK ON MY PHONE?
00:22:53.247,00:22:57.084,NO.
00:22:59.753,00:23:02.506,BUT DON'T DO THAT.
00:23:02.506,00:23:04.675,I KNOW.
00:23:42.088,00:23:43.463,"HEY, IT'S ME."
00:23:43.463,00:23:45.465,YOU GET IT?
00:23:45.465,00:23:46.884,I think I have a better idea.
00:23:46.884,00:23:49.345,SAM TEXTED LILA ALL THE TIME.
00:23:49.345,00:23:51.805,"THERE'S GOT TO BE EVIDENCE ON HIS PHONE STILL, RIGHT?"
00:24:01.023,00:24:03.859,WHAT -- YOU DIDN'T HEAR ENOUGH ON THE STAND?
00:24:03.859,00:24:12.034,"YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, MY SISTER HAD THIS FRIEND MARISSA, AND SHE WAS MY FIRST."
00:24:13.035,00:24:16.330,"I WAS 14, SHE WAS 18."
00:24:16.330,00:24:18.249,AND...I DON'T KNOW.
00:24:18.249,00:24:22.420,"I-I THOUGHT IT WAS PROBABLY TOO GOOD TO LAST, BUT I HUNG ON 'CAUSE SHE WAS HOT."
00:24:23.921,00:24:25.756,AND AFTER A WHILE...
00:24:28.259,00:24:30.552,I WAS PISSED.
00:24:30.552,00:24:34.348,"LIKE, REALLY..."
00:24:34.348,00:24:40.187,AND I'D ALWAYS THINK UP WAYS TO HURT HER IF I SAW HER AGAIN.
00:24:40.187,00:24:42.522,BUT I MEAN...
00:24:42.522,00:24:45.483,"DUDE, I KNOW YOU'RE GAY."
00:24:47.403,00:24:48.862,AND I DIDN'T KILL ELKE.
00:24:48.862,00:24:50.823,I LOVED HER.
00:24:50.823,00:24:52.366,SHE LOVED ME.
00:24:52.366,00:24:58.164,"NOW, IF I'M ON A JURY, I THINK THAT STORY'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE."
00:24:58.164,00:25:00.582,"I MEAN, NO RELATIONSHIP IS THAT PERFECT."
00:25:07.047,00:25:09.216,Michaela: HOW'D THE TREASURE HUNT GO?
00:25:10.676,00:25:14.138,ALL I CAME UP WITH WAS A FLAMING PENIS.
00:25:14.138,00:25:16.223,IS THAT SOME SORT OF GAY EUPHEMISM?
00:25:16.223,00:25:17.515,NO.
00:25:17.515,00:25:22.771,"UH, ELKE GAVE CODY AN STD -- TRICHA...MANIA OR SOMETHING."
00:25:25.316,00:25:27.401,DO YOU MEAN TRICHOMONIASIS?
00:25:27.401,00:25:29.236,YEAH.
00:25:29.236,00:25:31.738,I MAJORED PREMED IN UNDERGRAD.
00:25:31.738,00:25:39.121,I STILL REMEMBER EVERYTHING -- INCLUDING THAT THERE'S A SPECIFIC ANTIBIOTIC THAT TREATS TRICHOMONIASIS.
00:25:42.208,00:25:45.461,TINIDAZOLE.
00:25:45.461,00:25:47.213,THAT I JUST WON OUR CASE FOR US.
00:25:47.213,00:25:49.715,GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR LITTLE STUDY GROUP.
00:25:59.850,00:26:01.601,JUST TELL ME -- WHAT'D YOU FIGURE OUT?
00:26:01.601,00:26:03.896,WHY RUIN THE SUSPENSE?
00:26:05.147,00:26:10.319,"Annalise: MR. THOMAS, WHAT HAPPENED IF YOUR WIFE EVER DRANK A GLASS OF WINE BEFORE TAKING HER SLEEPING PILL?"
00:26:10.319,00:26:12.279,THEN SHE WAS PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE TO WAKE.
00:26:12.279,00:26:16.409,"I'D HAVE TO JUST LET HER SLEEP IT OFF, WHICH IS WHY GRETCHEN DOESN'T USUALLY DRINK."
00:26:16.409,00:26:18.827,BUT SHE DID THE NIGHT ELKE WAS MURDERED?
00:26:18.827,00:26:20.454,IT WAS A...SPECIAL OCCASION.
00:26:20.454,00:26:22.373,GRETCHEN HAD JUST SOLD ANOTHER HOUSE.
00:26:22.373,00:26:23.541,WE CELEBRATED AT DINNER.
00:26:23.541,00:26:25.543,ANYTHING ELSE HAPPEN THAT DAY?
00:26:25.543,00:26:27.127,YOU MEAN THE MURDER?
00:26:27.127,00:26:29.922,"NO, I MEAN WHAT YOUR SON, CODY, TOLD YOU."
00:26:31.298,00:26:32.716,I'M SORRY?
00:26:32.716,00:26:41.183,"MR. THOMAS, ON THE DAY ELKE WAS KILLED, DIDN'T YOUR SON, CODY, TELL YOU THAT HE WAS EXPERIENCING SOME PAINFUL URINATION?"
00:26:42.893,00:26:45.145,WELL...
00:26:42.893,00:26:50.692,"YES, BUT I-I HAD -- AND WHEN HE TOLD YOU, DID YOU NOT THINK BACK TO WHEN YOU HAD EXPERIENCED THE SAME PAINFUL URINATION?"
00:26:50.692,00:26:52.236,"HOW IS THIS RELEVANT, YOUR HONOR?"
00:26:52.236,00:27:01.370,"MEDICAL RECORDS SHOW THAT MR. THOMAS WAS TAKING THE PRESCRIPTION TINIDAZOLE, WHICH IS A PRESCRIPTION USED SPECIFICALLY TO TREAT TRICHOMONIASIS."
00:27:04.373,00:27:06.666,"THAT DRUG WAS FOR CODY, NOT FOR ME."
00:27:06.666,00:27:10.670,WRONG -- YOU WERE PRESCRIBED THAT DRUG THREE MONTHS BEFORE CODY CAME TO YOU.
00:27:10.670,00:27:17.177,"BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, YOU NEEDED YOUR OWN BECAUSE YOU, TOO, WERE TAKING PART IN A SEXUAL AFFAIR WITH ELKE."
00:27:17.177,00:27:25.811,"AND WHEN YOUR SON CAME TO YOU, HE REVEALED THAT HE WAS ALSO SLEEPING WITH HER -- A WOMAN YOU THOUGHT SOLELY WAS YOURS -- AND YOU BECAME JEALOUS."
00:27:25.811,00:27:30.857,"AT DINNER THAT NIGHT, DIDN'T YOU OPEN A BOTTLE OF WINE, EVEN ENCOURAGE YOUR WIFE TO HAVE A GLASS TO CELEBRATE HER NEW SALE?"
00:27:30.857,00:27:32.526,IT WAS A REALLY BIG COMMISSION.
00:27:32.526,00:27:37.406,"NO, YOU NEEDED HER TO STAY OUT OF IT THAT NIGHT SO YOU CAN GO INTO ELKE'S ROOM AND STAB HER TO DEATH."
00:27:37.406,00:27:40.284,THAT IS -- NO!
00:27:37.406,00:27:46.999,"THEN YOU GOT YOUR DRUGGED, TYPE-A WIFE OUT OF BED, SHOWED HER THE BLOODY, TERRIBLE MESS YOU MADE, KNOWING FULL WELL THAT SHE WOULD TRY AND CLEAN IT UP."
00:28:01.305,00:28:02.722,I'M SO SORRY.
00:28:04.475,00:28:07.478,"IT'S TOO LATE FOR APOLOGIES, MR. THOMAS."
00:28:09.355,00:28:11.148,THE DEFENSE RESTS.
00:28:26.622,00:28:28.374,YOU ANIMAL.
00:28:28.374,00:28:32.419,"I HIRED YOU TO DEFEND ME, NOT DESTROY MY FAMILY."
00:28:39.259,00:28:44.515,"HE LIED TO YOU, BETRAYED YOU, TOOK ADVANTAGE OF YOUR LOYALTY AND TRUST."
00:28:44.515,00:28:46.517,AND THAT'S UNFORGIVABLE.
00:29:01.823,00:29:08.330,"PROFESSOR KEATING, SINCE I HELPED IN THE CASE TODAY, I WAS THINKING -- THERE'S NOTHING BARRING YOU FROM TAKING THE TROPHY FROM ASHER AND AWARDING IT TO ME."
00:29:08.330,00:29:09.873,I THOUGHT YOU HAD THE TROPHY.
00:29:09.873,00:29:14.294,"NO, BUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT MEANS YOU THINK I DESERVE IT, WHICH I DO."
00:29:14.294,00:29:19.550,"I DON'T CARE WHO HAS THE TROPHY, MS. PRATT -- YOU, MR. MILLSTONE."
00:29:19.550,00:29:20.759,IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.
00:29:20.759,00:29:22.678,OF COURSE IT MATTERS.
00:29:22.678,00:29:25.138,YOU BUILT OUR ENTIRE SEMESTER ON IT.
00:29:25.138,00:29:28.726,"WINNING IT, T-THAT MEANS YOU'RE AT THE TOP OF THE CLASS, THAT -- MICHAELA."
00:29:28.726,00:29:30.728,YOU HAVE A VISITOR.
00:29:38.611,00:29:39.986,MRS. WALKER.
00:29:42.239,00:29:44.157,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
00:29:44.157,00:29:50.497,"I THOUGHT IT BEST TO TALK IN PERSON -- BRING THE MOUNTAIN TO MOHAMMED, AS THEY SAY."
00:29:50.497,00:29:54.585,OR DO YOU NOT HAVE TIME FOR YOUR FUTURE MOTHER-IN-LAW?
00:29:57.796,00:29:59.423,TYPICAL MIDDLETON BEHAVIOR?
00:29:59.423,00:30:02.635,THERE'S A BONFIRE FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM TONIGHT.
00:30:08.098,00:30:09.391,LOVELY.
00:30:09.391,00:30:11.268,I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.
00:30:11.268,00:30:16.064,"AND WHILE I REALIZE A PRENUP IS A DELICATE SUBJECT -- NOW, THERE IS NOTHING DELICATE ABOUT THIS."
00:30:16.064,00:30:18.317,THIS IS NOT EMOTIONAL.
00:30:18.317,00:30:22.780,"ACTUALLY, THIS IS ABOUT MY MARRIAGE TO AIDEN, SO...NOT BUSINESS."
00:30:24.740,00:30:27.909,MY HUSBAND AND I BUILT OUR COMPANY FROM THE GROUND UP.
00:30:27.909,00:30:36.042,"THE FIRST STORE EVENTUALLY BECAME 10, 10 BECAME 50, AND NOW WE RUN A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION."
00:30:36.042,00:30:46.512,AND WHILE AIDEN HAS DECIDED TO PURSUE A POLITICAL CAREER -- WHICH MAKES ROBERT AND ME VERY HAPPY -- THIS LEGACY WILL STILL BELONG TO HIM.
00:30:46.512,00:30:51.642,SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY WE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO WALTZ IN AND REAP THE BENEFITS.
00:30:51.642,00:30:53.686,I'M NOT MARRYING AIDEN FOR HIS MONEY.
00:30:53.686,00:30:56.104,I'M MARRYING HIM BECAUSE I LOVE HIM.
00:30:56.104,00:30:58.982,"OH. WELL, THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SENTIMENT."
00:30:58.982,00:31:01.568,BUT IT'S NOT ONE THAT I'LL BET MY LIFE'S WORK ON.
00:31:01.568,00:31:03.696,I'M NOT SIGNING THE PRENUP.
00:31:03.696,00:31:11.077,"AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO TAKE ANYONE'S MONEY, BUT BECAUSE I PLAN ON STAYING MARRIED TO AIDEN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE."
00:31:11.077,00:31:13.497,THAT'S HOW SERIOUSLY I TAKE THIS COMMITMENT.
00:31:25.384,00:31:28.261,EITHER SIGN...
00:31:28.261,00:31:30.222,OR I CANCEL THE WEDDING.
00:31:39.356,00:31:47.614,"YOU SIGN, OR I WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO BACK TO THAT NASTY, BACKWOOD, BAYOU SWAMP YOU CAME FROM, YOU STUBBORN BITCH!"
00:31:49.282,00:31:51.117,"OH, YOU WANT TO PLAY?"
00:31:51.117,00:31:53.161,LET'S GO.
00:32:00.669,00:32:03.630,AT LEAST I KNOW I WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU NOW.
00:32:16.351,00:32:19.354,HURRY.
00:32:28.113,00:32:29.239,"HI, THERE."
00:32:32.910,00:32:34.411,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
00:32:34.411,00:32:39.291,"WELL, THE FIRM GAVE ME A FEW DAYS OFF, AND...THOUGHT I WOULD SURPRISE YOU."
00:32:39.291,00:32:41.084,LOOKS LIKE I DID.
00:32:41.084,00:32:42.210,WHO IS THIS?
00:32:42.210,00:32:44.880,SASHA -- HIS GIRLFRIEND.
00:32:44.880,00:32:47.382,AND YOU MUST BE...
00:32:47.382,00:32:49.217,THE STUDENT OF THE MONTH?
00:33:04.733,00:33:05.943,WHAT IS IT?
00:33:13.366,00:33:15.661,I MET LILA THE NIGHT SHE WAS KILLED.
00:33:24.419,00:33:28.214,I NEED TO SEE ANNALISE KEATING.
00:33:28.214,00:33:31.635,IS THIS ABOUT FRANK?
00:33:31.635,00:33:33.428,IS ANNALISE IN THERE?
00:33:33.428,00:33:35.973,DO YOU NEED A LAWYER?
00:33:35.973,00:33:38.558,NO. I JUST NEED TO TALK TO ANNALISE.
00:33:38.558,00:33:41.520,TELL HER IT'S ABOUT HER HUSBAND.
00:33:45.440,00:33:46.650,SHE'S NOT HERE.
00:33:46.650,00:33:49.528,"THAT'S HER CAR, ISN'T IT?"
00:33:49.528,00:33:52.238,ANNALISE!
00:33:52.238,00:33:57.160,"I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, BUT I GUARANTEE YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET THIS."
00:34:05.002,00:34:07.170,"LEAVE, OR I CALL 911."
00:34:08.213,00:34:09.798,FINE.
00:34:09.798,00:34:12.968,BUT TELL HER I CAME TO TELL HER SOMETHING IMPORTANT.
00:34:14.260,00:34:16.930,HE CAN'T KEEP IT A SECRET ANYMORE.
00:34:30.318,00:34:33.030,THAT WAS THE SECRET?
00:34:39.160,00:34:41.079,SAM.
00:34:41.079,00:34:45.124,PLEASE.
00:34:46.418,00:34:48.003,THIS IS ME.
00:34:58.304,00:35:02.517,WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO TO TELL HER NOW?
00:35:04.102,00:35:07.272,I DIDN'T HURT THAT GIRL.
00:35:07.272,00:35:13.070,BUT WE BOTH KNOW HOW MUCH THIS WOULD DEVASTATE ANNIE.
00:35:23.455,00:35:25.791,BON...
00:35:25.791,00:35:27.500,YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD MY BACK.
00:35:31.713,00:35:36.009,BUT I NEED YOU NOW MORE THAN EVER.
00:36:03.369,00:36:07.833,I DIDN'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS -- NOT UNTIL THE FLIERS WENT UP.
00:36:09.751,00:36:12.921,AND I THOUGHT SAM WAS AT YALE THAT NIGHT.
00:36:12.921,00:36:17.425,"I THOUGHT YOU TWO WERE WORKING THROUGH THINGS, SO I DIDN'T THINK..."
00:36:19.803,00:36:21.429,I'M SO SORRY.
00:36:21.429,00:36:23.473,I JUST...
00:36:23.473,00:36:27.393,DIDN'T KNOW WHAT GOOD IT WOULD DO TO TELL YOU.
00:36:29.062,00:36:32.607,AND I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE COULD DO SUCH A THING -- THAT HE COULD HURT HER.
00:36:46.621,00:36:49.415,HE KNEW SHE WAS PREGNANT.
00:36:56.798,00:36:58.842,HE TOLD YOU THAT?
00:37:01.302,00:37:02.721,HE KISSED ME...
00:37:02.721,00:37:06.474,SO I'D LIE TO YOU.
00:37:06.474,00:37:10.478,HE THOUGHT HE WAS FINALLY GIVING ME WHAT I WANTED...
00:37:11.688,00:37:13.272,...BUT...
00:37:16.193,00:37:20.321,"HE'S NOT A GOOD MAN, ANNALISE."
00:37:46.890,00:37:48.558,YOU'RE FIRED.
00:37:50.143,00:37:51.519,PLEASE.
00:37:52.520,00:37:54.439,ANNALISE.
00:37:55.440,00:37:56.608,LEAVE.
00:38:00.528,00:38:02.572,AND DON'T COME BACK.
00:38:19.589,00:38:21.340,Nate: PLUG IT INTO HIS COMPUTER.
00:38:21.340,00:38:26.721,"IT'LL DOWNLOAD ALL HIS PHONE INFORMATION, INCLUDING THE COORDINATES WHERE HE WAS THAT NIGHT."
00:38:26.721,00:38:28.681,"WELL, WHAT IF HE CLEARED HIS PHONE?"
00:38:28.681,00:38:29.849,DOESN'T MATTER.
00:38:29.849,00:38:33.686,"IF HE BACKED IT UP BEFORE THAT, COMPUTER'S STORING WHAT WE NEED."
00:38:37.107,00:38:39.317,TELL ME NOW IF YOU WANT TO BAIL.
00:38:40.693,00:38:41.736,NOPE.
00:38:43.404,00:38:45.157,I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET IT.
00:38:58.878,00:39:01.089,"Rebecca: I-I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING, FOR ONCE."
00:39:01.089,00:39:03.591,"YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING FOR ME, RISKED EVERYTHING."
00:39:03.591,00:39:07.095,I-I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT YOU OR MESS UP YOUR LIFE ANY MORE THAN I ALREADY HAVE.
00:39:07.095,00:39:08.596,"WHEN HE CAME TO ME, I THOUGHT -- HER BOYFRIEND!"
00:39:08.596,00:39:10.223,I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS HER BOYFRIEND!
00:39:10.223,00:39:12.184,I WOULD'VE TOLD YOU IF YOU JUST TRUSTED ME.
00:39:12.184,00:39:13.351,I DO TRUST YOU.
00:39:13.351,00:39:14.352,DO YOU?
00:39:14.352,00:39:18.648,BECAUSE THIS -- SHE'S SETTING US UP.
00:39:18.648,00:39:21.067,ANNALISE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT SOME SORT OF PLAN.
00:39:21.067,00:39:24.445,"SO HER TELLING ME LILA'S PREGNANT, THEN SENDING HER BOYFRIEND?"
00:39:26.281,00:39:29.284,NOW SHE KNOWS I LIED TO HER.
00:39:30.743,00:39:33.038,YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.
00:39:33.038,00:39:36.541,I TELL YOU EVERYTHING -- THINGS NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT ME.
00:39:36.541,00:39:39.211,YOU JUST WENT BEHIND MY BACK LIKE IT'S NOTHING.
00:39:39.211,00:39:42.297,I'M BEING HONEST NOW.
00:39:42.297,00:39:44.382,Connor: WAITLIST! OPEN UP!

00:40:51.908,00:40:54.369,"PEOPLE WANT TO BE PACING THEMSELVES, YOU KNOW?"
00:40:54.369,00:40:55.995,OF COURSE.
00:40:55.995,00:40:58.081,"THIS BONFIRE'S BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER 100 YEARS, THOUGH."
00:40:58.081,00:41:04.545,"IT'S ONLY BEEN CANCELED TWICE -- ONCE FOR, UH, PEARL HARBOR, AND THEN ONCE FOR SOME FLU PANDEMIC."
00:41:04.545,00:41:15.223,"BUT TONIGHT -- TONIGHT IS GONNA BE A HEEZY, FO' SHEEZY -- REBECCA, LET ME IN!"

00:41:23.522,00:41:25.524,MAYBE SHE JUST TURNED ON MUSIC TO THROW YOU OFF.
00:41:32.615,00:41:34.242,SHE TOOK IT.
00:41:34.242,00:41:35.660,TOOK WHAT?
00:41:36.828,00:41:38.246,DID YOU BRING YOUR CAR?
00:41:39.580,00:41:41.874,"Annalise: IT'S UNORTHODOX, I KNOW."
00:41:41.874,00:41:43.751,WHO KNOWS WHAT WE'LL FIND?
00:41:43.751,00:41:48.340,"BUT FOR THE FAMILY'S SAKE, IT'S IMPORTANT WE GET AT THE TRUTH ONE WAY OR ANOTHER."
00:41:49.799,00:41:51.592,THANK YOU.
00:41:55.054,00:41:56.222,WHO WAS THAT?
00:41:56.222,00:41:59.058,THE D.A.'s OFFICE.
00:41:59.058,00:42:06.565,"SINCE LILA WAS PREGNANT, I'M DEMANDING THAT THEY COLLECT DNA SAMPLES OF ALL THE MEN IN HER LIFE..."
00:42:06.565,00:42:08.443,INCLUDING HER TEACHERS.
00:00:06.005,00:00:08.968,PREVIOUSLY ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER...
00:00:08.968,00:00:11.219,DO YOU HAVE TIME FOR YOUR FUTURE MOTHER-IN-LAW?
00:00:11.219,00:00:12.596,I'M NOT SIGNING THE PRENUP.
00:00:12.596,00:00:14.389,YOU STUBBORN BITCH!
00:00:15.307,00:00:17.267,MICHAELA.
00:00:17.267,00:00:22.606,"TONIGHT IS GONNA BE THE HEEZY, FO' SHEEZY -- HI, THERE."
00:00:22.606,00:00:24.191,SASHA -- HIS GIRLFRIEND.
00:00:24.191,00:00:25.818,Nate: I KNOW YOU DIDN'T KILL LILA STANGARD.
00:00:25.818,00:00:28.069,AND WE BOTH KNOW WHO DID -- HELP ME CATCH HIM.
00:00:28.069,00:00:30.447,LILA WAS PREGNANT.
00:00:30.447,00:00:32.867,PLUG IT INTO HIS COMPUTER.
00:00:32.867,00:00:35.327,SHE TOOK IT.
00:00:35.327,00:00:37.746,Bonnie: HE KISSED ME...
00:00:37.746,00:00:39.498,HE KNEW SHE WAS PREGNANT.
00:00:39.498,00:00:41.834,YOU'RE FIRED.
00:00:41.834,00:00:46.254,"SINCE LILA WAS PREGNANT, I'M DEMANDING THAT THEY COLLECT DNA SAMPLES OF ALL THE MEN IN HER LIFE..."
00:00:46.254,00:00:47.798,INCLUDING HER TEACHERS.
00:00:57.766,00:01:00.268,"I KNOW NOTHING -- ABOUT YOU, US."
00:01:00.268,00:01:02.897,WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
00:01:02.897,00:01:04.648,HOW STUPID COULD YOU BE?
00:01:06.483,00:01:10.654,"ALL RIGHT, JUST -- ANNIE, WAIT."
00:01:07.902,00:01:12.614,"I LIED, YES, BUT ONLY BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID YOU'D THINK I KILLED HER."
00:01:12.614,00:01:14.533,DIDN'T YOU?
00:01:14.533,00:01:18.412,"ANNIE, PLEASE. J-- YOU LIE SO MUCH, YOUR WORDS MEAN NOTHING TO ME."
00:01:18.412,00:01:21.040,YOU MEAN NOTHING TO ME.
00:01:21.040,00:01:22.875,NO! I'M DONE SAVING YOUR ASS!
00:01:22.875,00:01:24.752,I'M DONE LOVING YOU!
00:01:24.752,00:01:26.378,I AM BEGGING YOU -- DO NOT GIVE UP ON ME.
00:01:26.378,00:01:28.255,I ALREADY HAVE.
00:01:28.255,00:01:30.215,"GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE, OR I'M GONNA CALL 911!"
00:01:30.215,00:01:32.885,I AM NOT LEAVING UNTIL YOU TALK TO ME!
00:01:37.222,00:01:42.352,"IF ONE OF THESE IDIOTS TOUCHES MY CAR, I'M GONNA RUN THEM OVER."
00:01:47.983,00:01:50.694,STILL NOT PICKING UP?
00:01:50.694,00:01:52.947,"HEY, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE'S EVEN AT ANNALISE'S?"
00:01:52.947,00:01:54.823,"I MEAN, MAYBE SHE GOT HUNGRY OR WENT TO SCORE SOME DRUGS."
00:01:54.823,00:01:56.283,SHE WENT THERE.
00:01:56.283,00:02:00.704,"I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU KEEP SAYING, BUT I'M SUGGESTING OTHERWISE."
00:02:00.704,00:02:03.123,"I MEAN, EVEN IF SHE'S THERE, WHAT DOES IT MATTER?"
00:02:03.123,00:02:04.458,WE HAVE TO STUDY.
00:02:03.123,00:02:06.126,"THE EXAM -- SAM KILLED LILA, OKAY?"
00:02:06.126,00:02:08.253,THAT'S WHY SHE'S GOING OVER THERE.
00:02:08.253,00:02:10.380,SHE'S TRYING TO PROVE IT.
00:02:10.380,00:02:12.674,"Sam: I'M NOT A VIOLENT MAN, ANNIE."
00:02:12.674,00:02:14.384,EVERYONE'S VIOLENT GIVEN THE CHANCE.
00:02:14.384,00:02:16.136,NO. NOT ME.
00:02:16.136,00:02:17.930,I TRIED TO BELIEVE YOU THIS WHOLE TIME.
00:02:17.930,00:02:19.765,JUST CALM DOWN.
00:02:19.765,00:02:20.933,I AM STILL THE MAN YOU MARRIED.
00:02:20.933,00:02:22.559,YOU ARE NOT THAT MAN ANYMORE!
00:02:22.559,00:02:25.771,"AND I DON'T THINK YOU EVER WERE, WHICH IS WHY YOU CHOSE ME, ISN'T IT?"
00:02:25.771,00:02:31.735,"I'VE BEEN THE WINDOW DRESSING FOR YOU -- THE BLACK WOMAN ON YOUR ARM SO YOU CAN HIDE, SO THAT PEOPLE ONLY SAW THE GOOD GUY."
00:02:31.735,00:02:35.196,"AND MAYBE IT TOOK ME 20 YEARS TO SEE IT, BUT I DO NOW -- I SEE IT!"
00:02:35.196,00:02:41.620,"AND THAT'S WHY YOU KILLED LILA -- BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT, AND YOU KNEW THAT IF IT GOT OUT, PEOPLE WOULD SEE YOU FOR THE PATHETIC MAN YOU ARE!"
00:02:41.620,00:02:43.872,"IF YOU THINK I KILLED HER, WHY NOT JUST GO TO THE POLICE?"
00:02:43.872,00:02:46.000,WHY GET THEM TO RUN A DNA TEST INSTEAD?
00:02:46.000,00:02:53.423,"IT'S SO YOU CAN COVER YOUR OWN ASS, BECAUSE THAT'S WHO YOU ARE -- SOME SCARED LITTLE GIRL WHO PRETENDS TO BE STRONG BUT IS REALLY JUST WEAK AND SELFISH."
00:02:55.592,00:02:57.761,YOU'VE DONE NOTHING BUT MAKE MY LIFE MISERABLE!
00:03:01.932,00:03:03.767,I'VE BEEN SCREWING ANOTHER MAN.
00:03:03.767,00:03:05.978,Connor: WAIT.
00:03:05.978,00:03:07.521,THIS ISN'T A-A JOKE?
00:03:07.521,00:03:09.648,I DON'T CARE IF YOU BELIEVE ME.
00:03:09.648,00:03:12.151,ARE YOU HEARING THIS?
00:03:09.648,00:03:15.236,I MEAN -- WHY WOULD ANNALISE DEFEND REBECCA IF SHE THOUGHT SAM WAS INVOLVED?
00:03:15.236,00:03:17.865,BECAUSE I SAID I'D GO TO THE POLICE IF SHE DIDN'T.
00:03:17.865,00:03:19.867,OH. RIGHT.
00:03:19.867,00:03:21.576,YOU BLACKMAILED ANNALISE.
00:03:25.580,00:03:27.166,THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
00:03:27.166,00:03:28.959,YOU THINK SAM KILLED LILA?
00:03:28.959,00:03:31.545,YES.
00:03:31.545,00:03:35.382,"OH, THIS NIGHT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER."
00:03:36.550,00:03:38.719,HIS NAME IS NATE.
00:03:38.719,00:03:41.847,"AND, BOY, IS HE GOOD TO ME."
00:03:41.847,00:03:47.019,HE KNOWS ME -- JUST WHAT I LIKE AND HOW I LIKE IT.
00:03:47.019,00:03:50.689,HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE ME SCREAM AND GROAN AND SWEAT.
00:03:50.689,00:03:55.276,"AND SO I LET HIM TAKE ME WHEREVER HE WANTS -- ON THIS COUNTER, ON MY DESK, IN OUR BED."
00:03:55.276,00:03:58.989,JUST THINKING ABOUT HIM RIGHT NOW MAKES ME -- SHAMING ME FOR CHEATING ALL THIS TIME.
00:04:03.952,00:04:07.288,AND I THINK OF LILA EVERY TIME I TRY TO GET OFF WITH YOU!
00:04:07.288,00:04:08.999,I BET YOU DID.
00:04:08.999,00:04:11.085,"YOU ENJOYED IT, DIDN'T YOU?"
00:04:11.085,00:04:13.003,FEELING THE LIFE GO OUT OF HER BODY?
00:04:13.003,00:04:14.838,"YOU STILL THINK ABOUT IT, DON'T YOU?"
00:04:14.838,00:04:16.631,YOUR HAND AROUND HER NECK WHILE YOU WERE STILL INSIDE OF HER.
00:04:16.631,00:04:19.051,"IT'S EXCITING YOU RIGHT NOW, ISN'T IT? REMEMBERING IT?"
00:04:19.051,00:04:20.969,"YOU WANT TO DO IT TO ME NOW, DON'T YOU?"
00:04:39.320,00:04:40.864,YOU'RE A MONSTER.
00:04:40.864,00:04:42.908,"MONSTER, HUH?"
00:04:42.908,00:04:45.160,YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.
00:04:45.160,00:04:46.327,YOU WANT THE TRUTH?
00:04:48.080,00:04:49.957,YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A PIECE OF ASS.
00:04:49.957,00:04:58.465,THAT'S WHAT I SAW WHEN I FIRST TALKED TO YOU IN THE OFFICE THAT DAY -- 'CAUSE I KNEW YOU'D PUT OUT.
00:04:58.465,00:05:07.266,"THAT'S ALL YOU'RE REALLY GOOD FOR -- DIRTY, ROUGH SEX THAT I'M TOO ASHAMED TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT."
00:05:07.266,00:05:11.561,"THAT'S HOW FOUL YOU ARE, YOU DISGUSTING SLUT."
00:05:15.816,00:05:19.153,WELL...
00:06:22.590,00:06:24.968,OH. HI.
00:06:24.968,00:06:26.720,WHAT DO YOU WANT?
00:06:26.720,00:06:29.430,SHE'S NOT HERE.
00:06:29.430,00:06:31.975,NO. YOU SHOULD -- YOU SHOULD GO.
00:06:31.975,00:06:34.353,"I'LL JUST WAIT, IF I CAN."
00:06:34.353,00:06:39.024,I REALLY NEED TO TURN THIS IN TO GET OUT OF OUR EXAM.
00:06:39.024,00:06:42.236,JUST LEAVE IT ON HER DESK.
00:06:42.236,00:06:44.738,"IT'S, UM, IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT."
00:06:45.947,00:06:47.532,REBECCA?
00:06:51.786,00:06:52.871,WHAT IS THIS?
00:06:52.871,00:06:55.123,WHY ARE YOU BOTH HERE?
00:06:55.123,00:06:57.167,I'M JUST HERE TO TURN IN THE TROPHY.
00:06:57.167,00:06:59.378,IS...SOMETHING WRONG?
00:07:03.631,00:07:05.217,CALL WES.
00:07:11.556,00:07:13.183,"UNLOCK THE DOOR, REBECCA."
00:07:14.893,00:07:17.354,MICHAELA?
00:07:17.354,00:07:19.647,"WHOA, WHOA. MICHAELA, SLOW DOWN."
00:07:21.608,00:07:22.776,QUIT PLAYING AROUND AND OPEN THE DOOR.
00:07:22.776,00:07:24.403,IS ANNALISE THERE?
00:07:24.403,00:07:26.154,AND REBECCA'S LOCKED HERSELF INSIDE THEIR BEDROOM.
00:07:26.154,00:07:28.156,WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?
00:07:28.156,00:07:29.991,"SAM KILLED LILA, AND REBECCA'S TRYING TO PROVE IT."
00:07:29.991,00:07:32.077,"OPEN THE DOOR, REBECCA."
00:07:33.703,00:07:35.789,NO.
00:07:35.789,00:07:37.707,YOU CAN'T LEAVE HER ALONE WITH HIM.
00:07:37.707,00:07:39.709,PROMISE ME YOU WON'T LEAVE.
00:07:39.709,00:07:41.962,"COME OUT, OR I'M CALLING THE POLICE."
00:07:41.962,00:07:44.339,WHAT'S HE DOING?
00:07:41.962,00:07:46.091,"I -- AH -- I -- OPEN THE DOOR, REBECCA!"
00:07:46.091,00:07:48.427,"MICHAELA, TALK TO ME."
00:07:48.427,00:07:50.178,Y-You need to get here.
00:07:50.178,00:07:51.512,"Really, really bad."
00:07:51.512,00:07:54.015,Sam: I SAID OPEN THE DAMN DOOR!
00:07:54.015,00:07:57.227,WHAT'S HAPPENING?
00:07:57.227,00:07:59.604,"OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!"
00:07:59.604,00:08:02.357,Michaela!
00:08:09.781,00:08:11.532,"Michaela: PLEASE, MR. KEATING, STOP!"
00:08:11.532,00:08:12.993,"IF YOU JUST CALM DOWN, WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT."
00:08:17.414,00:08:20.917,Wes: STOP!
00:08:20.917,00:08:22.877,"LET HER GO, THEN WE'LL LEAVE."
00:08:22.877,00:08:24.754,SHE TOOK MY COMPUTER.
00:08:24.754,00:08:26.131,I DON'T KNOW.
00:08:26.131,00:08:29.550,"JUST...CALM DOWN, AND WE'LL LEAVE."
00:08:43.064,00:08:46.109,"REBECCA, IT'S ME."
00:08:46.109,00:08:48.320,GIVE ME A MINUTE.
00:08:59.247,00:09:00.499,"OKAY, I'M COMING."
00:09:02.167,00:09:03.084,GOOD.
00:09:03.084,00:09:04.544,I'M HERE.
00:09:16.097,00:09:18.141,WHAT DID YOU DO?
00:09:18.141,00:09:20.018,I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.
00:09:20.018,00:09:21.561,WE'LL LEAVE NOW.
00:09:41.248,00:09:44.125,"Michaela: OH, MY GOD!"
00:09:44.125,00:09:46.086,GRAB IT!
00:09:47.504,00:09:49.256,LAUREL!
00:09:55.262,00:09:56.888,AAAAAH!
00:09:57.972,00:09:59.099,AAAAH!
00:10:09.192,00:10:11.528,"OH, GOD."
00:10:34.134,00:10:36.886,WE NEED TO CALL AN AMBULANCE.
00:10:36.886,00:10:40.056,Connor: WHY? HE'S DEAD.
00:10:40.056,00:10:42.267,ME? H-HE WAS COMING AT US.
00:10:42.267,00:10:44.978,"YEAH, AND HE WAS ALIVE, UNTIL YOU SHOVED HIM OVER THE RAILING."
00:10:44.978,00:10:47.147,I WAS PROTECTING LAUREL.
00:10:47.147,00:10:48.815,FINE.
00:10:48.815,00:10:50.609,"SO DID YOU, THEN."
00:10:50.609,00:10:52.402,IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ANY OF US DID.
00:10:52.402,00:10:54.112,"WE WERE ALL HERE, WHICH MEANS WE'RE ALL AT FAULT."
00:10:54.112,00:10:55.572,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
00:10:55.572,00:10:59.242,REBECCA WAS STEALING PRIVATE INFORMATION OFF OF SAM'S COMPUTER.
00:10:59.242,00:11:03.913,"AND BECAUSE WE WERE ALL HELPING HER, WE COULD BE CHARGED WITH FELONY MURDER."
00:11:01.202,00:11:07.208,"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO PROSECUTOR WOULD DO THAT."
00:11:07.208,00:11:09.919,WE BROKE INTO HIS HOUSE.
00:11:09.919,00:11:12.380,I WAS JUST TRYING TO TURN IN THE TROPHY.
00:11:12.380,00:11:16.468,"I WASN'T PART OF YOUR PLAN IS ALL, SO I -- THERE WAS NO PLAN, OKAY?"
00:11:16.468,00:11:18.345,I DIDN'T ASK FOR ANYONE'S HELP.
00:11:18.345,00:11:19.846,FINE. THEN WE CAN THANK YOUR BOYFRIEND FOR THAT.
00:11:19.846,00:11:21.431,Michaela: SHOULDN'T WE BE CALLING THE AMBULANCE?
00:11:21.431,00:11:24.100,"I THINK YOU MEAN THE POLICE, IDIOT."
00:11:24.100,00:11:26.769,HE'S DEAD!
00:11:26.769,00:11:28.313,BUT WE CAN'T JUST SIT HERE AND DO NOTHING.
00:11:28.313,00:11:30.524,NO. THINK.
00:11:30.524,00:11:32.400,ANNALISE COULD BE HOME ANY MINUTE.
00:11:32.400,00:11:34.528,WHICH IS WHY WE SHOULD LEAVE.
00:11:34.528,00:11:37.322,I'M JUST SAYING -- HE FELL AFTER DRINKING TOO MUCH.
00:11:37.322,00:11:38.948,MY CAR IS OUTSIDE.
00:11:38.948,00:11:40.950,YOUR CAR'S HERE ALL OF THE TIME.
00:11:40.950,00:11:43.161,"NO, WE SHOULD CALL THE POLICE AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING."
00:11:43.161,00:11:45.205,BUT REBECCA CAN'T-- I DON'T CARE ABOUT REBECCA RIGHT NOW!
00:11:45.205,00:11:46.331,I CARE ABOUT MY FUTURE!
00:11:46.331,00:11:47.499,BUT YOU DID THIS!
00:11:47.499,00:11:50.126,JUST LIKE WE ALL DID.
00:11:50.126,00:11:52.962,HE'S DEAD BECAUSE OF ALL OF US.
00:11:52.962,00:11:54.797,AND MAYBE THAT'S OKAY.
00:11:57.676,00:12:01.137,"IT'S NOT -- OH, MY GOD!"
00:12:02.180,00:12:03.264,DO SOMETHING!
00:12:03.264,00:12:04.474,GET HIM OFF HER!
00:12:48.435,00:12:51.812,HE'S DEAD. HE'S DEAD.
00:12:51.812,00:12:53.690,WE HAVE TO GO -- RIGHT NOW.
00:12:53.690,00:12:58.152,He's dead.
00:13:00.447,00:13:01.989,YOU OKAY?
00:13:03.408,00:13:05.535,WE NEED TO CLEAN YOU UP AND GET OUT OF HERE.
00:13:08.622,00:13:10.331,OKAY.
00:13:10.331,00:13:11.832,GET READY TO LEAVE.
00:13:24.262,00:13:26.139,WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
00:13:56.377,00:13:58.087,Connor: WES! HURRY THE HELL UP!
00:14:08.598,00:14:09.766,WHAT?
00:14:10.767,00:14:11.976,THANK YOU.
00:14:21.528,00:14:23.697,"MICHAELA, WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW."
00:14:23.697,00:14:25.448,"JUST NEED TO STAND UP, OKAY?"
00:14:25.448,00:14:27.950,HERE'S WHAT WE DO.
00:14:27.950,00:14:29.786,I'LL GET REBECCA OUT OF HERE.
00:14:29.786,00:14:32.205,WAIT. WHAT -- YOU JUST -- YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE?
00:14:32.205,00:14:34.541,SHE CAN'T BE HERE.
00:14:34.541,00:14:36.459,WE'RE SO SCREWED.
00:14:36.459,00:14:38.127,IT'S GONNA BE FINE.
00:14:38.127,00:14:39.629,YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME RIGHT NOW.
00:14:39.629,00:14:41.506,Asher: HEY!
00:14:41.506,00:14:43.966,REBECCA: Who is that?
00:14:43.966,00:14:45.385,WES: Asher.
00:14:45.385,00:14:47.261,"I SEE YOUR CAR IN THE DRIVEWAY, CONNOR!"
00:14:47.261,00:14:48.429,OPEN UP THE DAMN DOOR!
00:14:48.429,00:14:50.931,"Okay, what is he doing here?"
00:14:57.355,00:14:59.232,CONNOR.
00:14:59.232,00:15:02.026,ARE YOU BITCHES SERIOUSLY TRYING TO IGNORE ME RIGHT NOW?!
00:15:03.194,00:15:05.363,AND YOU GUYS CALL ME IMMATURE?
00:15:09.743,00:15:12.495,We should just let him in.
00:15:12.495,00:15:16.541,"If he's been in the house, he'll -- he'll suddenly be a part of it, you know?"
00:15:16.541,00:15:17.958,The five of us have witnessed him here.
00:15:17.958,00:15:20.336,Then Daddy Millstone can help get us off.
00:15:20.336,00:15:22.255,We could get him to step in the blood.
00:15:22.255,00:15:24.507,Yeah.
00:15:24.507,00:15:26.926,Do you think that I wanted to be a part of this?
00:15:26.926,00:15:29.721,Wait. Listen.
00:15:37.144,00:15:39.689,HE'S GONE.
00:15:54.871,00:15:56.456,SCREW IT.
00:16:06.299,00:16:10.428,THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPREGNATING HER BEFORE HER DEATH.
00:16:10.428,00:16:12.179,"IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?"
00:16:12.179,00:16:13.848,FIRST THEY THINK IT'S THE BOYFRIEND AND THE BARTENDER.
00:16:15.767,00:16:19.270,I DIDN'T KNOW THE GIRL.
00:16:19.270,00:16:22.064,I DON'T WANT NO POLICE KEEPING MY DNA ON FILE.
00:16:22.064,00:16:24.818,YOU'VE GOT SECRETS TO HIDE?
00:16:24.818,00:16:27.111,INVESTIGATORS TELL US THEY EXPECT FULL COOPERATION...
00:16:27.111,00:16:29.530,DON'T WE ALL?
00:16:52.720,00:16:54.764,Wes: DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL I'M BACK.
00:16:54.764,00:16:56.182,OKAY?
00:16:57.517,00:16:59.226,HE WANTED TO KILL ME.
00:16:59.226,00:17:00.937,I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE.
00:17:00.937,00:17:02.939,"I HAD TO KILL HIM, OR HE WAS GONNA KILL ME."
00:17:02.939,00:17:04.899,I SAW THE TROPHY SITTING THERE.
00:17:04.899,00:17:06.651,I HIT HIM IN THE HEAD.
00:17:06.651,00:17:08.486,AND I'M GLAD HE'S DEAD.
00:17:08.486,00:17:10.029,STOP IT!
00:17:10.029,00:17:11.865,"LOOK, MY TRIAL'S IN A COUPLE DAYS."
00:17:11.865,00:17:13.658,I'M ALREADY GOING TO JAIL.
00:17:13.658,00:17:17.286,"AND NOW YOU MIGHT, TOO, BECAUSE OF ME, AND I WILL KILL MYSELF IF THAT HAPPENS."
00:17:17.286,00:17:20.832,"SO, PLEASE -- PLEASE JUST LET ME HELP YOU FOR ONCE."
00:17:22.333,00:17:27.714,THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO TO HELP RIGHT NOW IS STAY IN THIS ROOM AND NOT LEAVE.
00:17:29.674,00:17:32.886,I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I CAN.
00:17:49.944,00:17:51.320,Laurel: DO SOMETHING.
00:17:51.320,00:17:52.739,Michaela: GET HIM OFF HER!
00:17:58.912,00:18:01.247,Man: HEY! ASSHAT!
00:18:01.247,00:18:03.332,"SOMETIME THIS YEAR, WILL YA?"
00:18:56.135,00:18:58.888,I'M SO SORRY.
00:19:09.065,00:19:12.151,WHAT IF THEY GOT CAUGHT OR WENT TO THE POLICE OR SHE CONVINCED HIM TO PIN IT ON US?
00:19:12.151,00:19:13.402,WES WOULDN'T DO THAT.
00:19:16.530,00:19:19.659,THINK ABOUT IT.
00:19:19.659,00:19:21.494,IT'S NOT HER FAULT.
00:19:23.496,00:19:25.205,Connor: STOP ACTING LIKE A LITTLE BITCH BABY.
00:19:25.205,00:19:26.582,DO NOT TELL ME HOW TO FEEL RIGHT NOW!
00:19:26.582,00:19:28.042,Wes: HEY!
00:19:28.042,00:19:29.877,SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.
00:19:29.877,00:19:31.378,I WENT BACK FOR THIS.
00:19:32.755,00:19:34.590,"NOW, YOU -- YOU TAKE THAT BACK RIGHT NOW!"
00:19:34.590,00:19:36.342,NO. IT'S SMART.
00:19:36.342,00:19:42.515,COMMONWEALTH v. DELOATCHE -- A CASE THE PROSECUTION SHOULD'VE WON BUT LOST BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MURDER WEAPON.
00:19:42.515,00:19:44.391,"SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?"
00:19:44.391,00:19:46.435,HIDE IT IN PLAIN SIGHT.
00:19:46.435,00:19:48.896,AFTER WE BURY THE BODY.
00:19:48.896,00:19:50.898,NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
00:19:50.898,00:19:53.151,"YEAH, I-I-I-I'M WITH MICHAELA."
00:19:53.151,00:19:54.735,"NO, CONNOR, THINK."
00:19:54.735,00:19:56.988,"THE TROPHY, WE NEED, YES, BUT THE BODY STAYS WHERE IT IS."
00:19:56.988,00:19:58.739,"NO, THE BODY IS WHAT GETS US CAUGHT."
00:19:58.739,00:20:01.408,YOU ARE NOT THINKING STRAIGHT.
00:20:01.408,00:20:04.620,SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE CARRYING A BODY ACROSS CAMPUS ON THE BUSIEST NIGHT OF THE YEAR!
00:20:06.831,00:20:09.000,"EVEN IF WE GET IT OUT OF THE HOUSE UNSEEN, THE GROUND IS FROZEN!"
00:20:09.000,00:20:10.543,WE HAVE ALL NIGHT TO DIG.
00:20:10.543,00:20:12.670,YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
00:20:12.670,00:20:14.588,THIS IS MURDER! NONE OF US KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT!
00:20:20.803,00:20:23.097,"I KNOW I CAN'T BE HERE, BUT I-I-I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO."
00:20:24.974,00:20:26.392,"I WANTED TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING, BUT..."
00:20:26.392,00:20:28.227,THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
00:20:28.227,00:20:30.730,EVERYTHING'S FALLING APART.
00:20:32.106,00:20:33.733,CAN YOU COME OUTSIDE?
00:20:35.609,00:20:37.778,NIA'S BACK IN THE HOSPITAL.
00:20:44.535,00:20:46.537,YOU COMING IN OR WHAT?
00:20:52.501,00:20:54.420,"Wes: HEADS, WE GET THE BODY."
00:20:54.420,00:20:56.672,"TAILS, WE LEAVE IT WHERE IT IS. OKAY?"
00:21:11.437,00:21:12.772,HEADS.
00:21:12.772,00:21:15.066,WE GO BACK FOR THE BODY.
00:21:15.066,00:21:16.734,Annalise: YOU WERE RIGHT.
00:21:22.073,00:21:24.242,I THINK SAM KILLED LILA.
00:21:26.077,00:21:27.578,WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT?
00:21:28.788,00:21:32.833,HE LIED -- ABOUT EVERYTHING.
00:21:32.833,00:21:35.335,"LILA WAS PREGNANT, AND HE KNEW."
00:21:35.335,00:21:37.797,HE KNEW.
00:21:45.263,00:21:46.472,YOU TELL ANYONE?
00:21:47.848,00:21:49.225,JUST YOU.
00:21:53.437,00:21:55.273,I TOLD THE D.A.
00:21:53.437,00:21:57.316,"TO RUN A DNA TEST ON ALL THE MEN IN HER LIFE, HER TEACHERS..."
00:21:59.318,00:22:00.402,YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
00:22:00.402,00:22:01.988,DID I?
00:22:01.988,00:22:06.533,"I MEAN, IF THEY FIND OUT THAT HE HURT HER, THAT I DID ALL THOSE THINGS TO HELP HIM -- ILLEGAL THINGS..."
00:22:06.533,00:22:08.368,"I MEAN, I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU."
00:22:08.368,00:22:10.204,I SHOULD'VE...LEFT HIM.
00:22:10.204,00:22:11.998,"INSTEAD, I TRIED TO PROTECT HIM."
00:22:11.998,00:22:15.375,HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.
00:22:20.673,00:22:22.508,NOT YOU.
00:22:22.508,00:22:24.635,"Michaela: OH, PLEASE."
00:22:24.635,00:22:26.512,YOU NEED AN INCINERATOR.
00:22:26.512,00:22:28.555,BUT AT LEAST WE'LL GET RID OF OUR DNA.
00:22:28.555,00:22:30.224,Connor: AND THE BONFIRE WILL COVER THE SMOKE.
00:22:30.224,00:22:31.600,IT'S -- IT'S KIND OF A PERFECT PLAN.
00:22:31.600,00:22:33.269,PERFECT?
00:22:33.269,00:22:35.104,PERFECT ABOUT THIS PLAN.
00:22:35.104,00:22:37.023,YOU GUYS...
00:22:37.023,00:22:38.941,I'M NOW ON BOARD WITH THE PLAN.

00:22:40.318,00:22:44.197,THE BONFIRE -- THAT'S OUR ALIBI.
00:23:02.298,00:23:04.133,"Connor: SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN HERE?"
00:23:04.133,00:23:09.513,"ARE WE GONNA CHOP HIM UP INTO BBQ-FRIENDLY PIECES NOW, OR ARE WE GONNA WAIT TILL HE'S BROILED TO A CRISP?"
00:23:11.724,00:23:13.059,GOOD TIMES.
00:23:13.059,00:23:14.392,LITTLE HELP?
00:23:14.392,00:23:15.978,HAPPY TO.
00:23:28.115,00:23:29.742,YOU ARE NOT ABOUT TO CALL AIDEN!
00:23:29.742,00:23:30.743,NO.
00:23:30.743,00:23:32.286,YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
00:23:36.290,00:23:39.752,"IF YOU CALL HIM, THE CELL TOWER WILL PLACE YOU IN THIS HOUSE."
00:23:39.752,00:23:41.628,"I KNOW, OKAY?"
00:23:41.628,00:23:43.672,"LOOK, I-I'M NOT GONNA CALL HIM."
00:23:41.628,00:23:46.300,CAN I PLEASE JUST HAVE MY -- THIS IS SCARY. I KNOW.
00:23:43.672,00:23:47.551,"AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I KNOW YOU -- HOW MUCH YOU LIKE TO BE IN CONTROL."
00:23:47.551,00:23:51.305,"BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU NEED TO ACCEPT THAT THIS SITUATION ISN'T ONE WE CAN CONTROL."
00:23:51.305,00:23:55.393,SO WE JUST NEED TO SWITCH OFF OUR BRAINS AND GO ALONG WITH THE PLAN.
00:23:55.393,00:23:57.061,YEAH.
00:23:57.061,00:23:59.813,AND DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE I'M A CHILD.
00:24:12.243,00:24:13.660,I SHOULD GO.
00:24:13.660,00:24:14.620,WHERE?
00:24:14.620,00:24:15.871,I DON'T KNOW.
00:24:15.871,00:24:17.206,"UH, TO A HOTEL."
00:24:17.206,00:24:19.333,DON'T WORRY.
00:24:19.333,00:24:22.128,YOU'RE TOO UPSET TO GO ANYWHERE.
00:24:22.128,00:24:24.755,STAY UNTIL YOU CALM DOWN.
00:24:24.755,00:24:26.132,"NO, NATE."
00:24:26.132,00:24:28.550,"ANNALISE, I'M TELLING YOU IT'S OKAY."
00:24:32.596,00:24:34.598,IT'S OKAY.
00:25:13.762,00:25:16.265,SO...

00:25:39.788,00:25:41.707,"UH, IT WAS KIND OF A BUST, ACTUALLY."
00:25:43.959,00:25:46.712,"I WAS...THINKING I COULD SWING BY, MAYBE."

00:26:09.902,00:26:11.153,NO ANSWER?
00:26:11.153,00:26:12.363,NO.
00:26:12.363,00:26:14.532,IT'S PROBABLY BETTER THAT WAY.
00:26:17.868,00:26:19.661,ARE WE TERRIBLE PEOPLE?
00:26:23.499,00:26:25.625,I DON'T KNOW.

00:27:43.912,00:27:47.291,I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD...
00:27:47.291,00:27:49.667,I'M A GROWN-ASS WOMAN.
00:27:49.667,00:27:55.382,"I MIGHT BE DRUNK, BUT I KNOW WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT IT."
00:28:24.495,00:28:25.996,IT'S FINE.
00:28:27.122,00:28:29.124,ONE SECOND.
00:28:29.124,00:28:30.959,"OH! JUST COME HERE, YOU IDIOT!"
00:28:30.959,00:28:32.085,TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF!
00:28:32.085,00:28:33.711,ALL RIGHT.
00:28:57.319,00:28:58.820,You've reached Sam Keating.
00:28:58.820,00:29:01.532,Please leave a message.
00:29:02.782,00:29:04.660,"SAM, IT'S ME."
00:29:07.746,00:29:10.249,I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU WOULD PICK UP.
00:29:12.792,00:29:14.670,WHAT WAS THAT?
00:29:14.670,00:29:20.676,"STILL, THERE'S SO MUCH I NEED TO SAY TO YOU IN PERSON AND NOT BY PHONE, BUT I GUESS THIS WILL HAVE TO DO."
00:29:21.801,00:29:23.554,WHY IS FRANK CALLING YOU?
00:29:23.554,00:29:24.722,WHAT?
00:29:24.722,00:29:25.931,"I SAW YOUR PHONE, LAUREL."
00:29:25.931,00:29:28.350,WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
00:29:37.735,00:29:39.612,Wes: OKAY. LAST CHANCE.
00:29:39.612,00:29:43.282,EITHER WE ALL AGREE OR WE STOP RIGHT NOW.
00:29:43.282,00:29:45.867,JUST DO IT.
00:29:48.328,00:29:49.705,MICHAELA?
00:29:49.705,00:29:53.125,IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO DESTROY THE DNA.
00:30:02.676,00:30:06.597,"Annalise: WHATEVER WE'VE SAID TO EACH OTHER, ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS..."
00:30:06.597,00:30:09.475,I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.
00:30:11.184,00:30:12.894,IT'S TOO LATE.
00:30:12.894,00:30:17.023,...WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER THROUGH SO MUCH -- EVERYTHING GOOD AND BAD IN OUR LIVES.
00:30:17.023,00:30:20.068,"Connor: HEY, GUYS. I THINK I JUST DETACHED THE TIBIA."
00:30:20.068,00:30:22.446,OR...IS THAT A FIBULA?
00:30:26.116,00:30:28.702,SO MUCH HAPPINESS.
00:30:28.702,00:30:34.750,IT'S A RARE THING TO KNOW SOMEONE THAT WELL AND TO BEAR WITNESS TO SO MUCH IN SOMEONE'S LIFE.
00:30:34.750,00:30:36.001,HERE.
00:30:36.001,00:30:38.378,SO I'M ASKING YOU RIGHT NOW -- NO.
00:30:39.505,00:30:40.922,BEGGING.
00:30:43.383,00:30:45.636,"OH, M-M-M-M-MY RING."
00:30:45.636,00:30:46.720,WHAT?
00:30:46.720,00:30:49.097,M-MY ENGAGEMENT RING IS GONE!
00:30:52.559,00:30:54.936,"I DIDN'T MEAN ANY OF IT, AND I KNOW YOU DIDN'T, EITHER."
00:30:54.936,00:30:57.356,ARE YOU SURE YOU HAD THE RING ON WHEN WE LEFT THE HOUSE?
00:30:57.356,00:30:59.858,I ALREADY TOLD YOU -- YES!
00:30:59.858,00:31:01.985,Annalise: I DON'T WANT THINGS TO END THIS WAY.
00:31:01.985,00:31:03.779,WHAT IF WE DON'T FIND IT?
00:31:03.779,00:31:05.739,I GUESS YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO CANCEL THE WEDDING.
00:31:05.739,00:31:07.616,Wes: STOP!
00:31:05.739,00:31:09.242,WE STILL NEED HER TO RETURN THE TROPHY TO ASHER'S.
00:31:09.242,00:31:10.828,THERE IS NO WAY SHE CAN DO THAT.
00:31:10.828,00:31:12.663,"OH, NO."
00:31:15.374,00:31:17.250,THIS ONE IS ON HER.
00:31:18.794,00:31:20.671,I'LL DO IT.
00:31:20.671,00:31:23.882,I WANT US TO WORK THROUGH THIS.
00:31:23.882,00:31:26.844,I SAID WAIT! MY RING MIGHT BE IN ONE OF THOSE!
00:31:26.844,00:31:28.762,"ENOUGH ABOUT THE RING, FRODO!"
00:31:28.762,00:31:31.348,Laurel: WE ARE NOT GOING THROUGH EVERY BAG.
00:31:32.891,00:31:34.810,Annalise: BECAUSE WHATEVER YOU DID...
00:31:37.855,00:31:42.442,WE NEED TO GET TO AN INCINERATOR AND FIND -- I HEARD YOU!
00:31:42.442,00:31:45.320,"I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'VE BEEN OUTVOTED ON THIS ONE."
00:31:45.320,00:31:47.947,"AAH! GOD! OH, GOD!"
00:31:47.947,00:31:50.992,"OH, GROW UP!"
00:31:52.244,00:31:55.539,THAT'S IT.
00:31:56.749,00:31:57.875,SAME TIME NEXT WEEK?
00:31:57.875,00:31:59.626,Laurel: CAN WE PLEASE JUST GO?
00:32:03.463,00:32:06.049,"TRAIN'S LEAVING, WAITLIST."
00:32:06.049,00:32:07.593,BECAUSE I'M YOUR WIFE.
00:32:09.469,00:32:11.930,"AND I LOVE YOU, AND I NEED YOU."
00:32:20.021,00:32:22.274,"SO PLEASE COME HOME, SAM."
00:32:23.983,00:32:25.903,COME HOME SO WE CAN BE TOGETHER.
00:32:28.781,00:32:30.449,COME HOME.
00:32:50.844,00:32:52.387,YOU IN THERE?
00:32:57.058,00:32:58.477,MORNING.
00:33:00.019,00:33:01.647,WHERE'D YOU GO?
00:33:01.647,00:33:03.482,UH...
00:33:03.482,00:33:06.944,"I HAVE A BAGFUL OF BAGELS AND TWO COFFEES, SO -- WHERE'S THE THUMB DRIVE?"
00:33:07.903,00:33:09.154,IT'S RIGHT HERE.
00:33:12.658,00:33:13.992,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
00:33:13.992,00:33:15.994,WHY THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT?!
00:33:15.994,00:33:17.663,BECAUSE WE CAN'T USE IT.
00:33:17.663,00:33:19.539,ARE YOU CRAZY? THIS IS WHAT PROVES THAT SAM KILLED LILA.
00:33:19.539,00:33:21.500,IT ALSO PROVES WE WERE AT HIS HOUSE LAST NIGHT.
00:33:26.546,00:33:28.590,DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT.
00:33:46.316,00:33:48.568,"I SCREWED UP, OLIVER."
00:33:48.568,00:33:51.237,I SCREWED UP SO BAD.
00:33:53.657,00:33:56.785,I SCREWED UP.
00:33:58.954,00:34:01.748,I SCREWED UP.
00:34:03.792,00:34:05.460,IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
00:34:05.460,00:34:07.587,"IT ISN'T. NO, IT ISN'T."
00:34:07.587,00:34:08.714,IT WILL BE.
00:34:10.089,00:34:12.759,COME INSIDE...
00:34:12.759,00:34:14.511,AND TELL ME EVERYTHING.
00:34:15.637,00:34:17.764,Laurel: I NEED YOUR HELP.
00:34:23.896,00:34:26.398,I STOLE IT FROM ASHER.
00:34:31.069,00:34:36.616,"I STILL HAVEN'T BROKEN UP WITH KAN, AND WHEN I FOUND OUT YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND -- EX-GIRLFRIEND."
00:34:36.616,00:34:39.118,"WHATEVER. I STOLE IT, AND IT WAS DUMB."
00:34:39.118,00:34:45.000,"I JUST DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THAT I'M THE SHOOTING STAR, SO I CAN'T HAVE IT, AND ASHER CAN'T KNOW THAT I TOOK IT."
00:34:46.543,00:34:48.795,THAT'S THE REALLY BAD THING YOU WANTED TO TELL ME?
00:34:48.795,00:34:51.590,IT'S STUPID. I KNOW.
00:34:51.590,00:34:53.800,I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
00:34:53.800,00:34:56.344,Asher: THOSE FRICKING LIARS.
00:34:56.344,00:35:02.893,"FIRST THEY STEAL MY TROPHY, THEN THEY GO PARTY AT THE BONFIRE AFTER MAKING FUN OF ME FOR WANTING TO GO IN THE FIRST PLACE."
00:35:02.893,00:35:06.063,YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T TELL THEM ABOUT THIS.
00:35:06.063,00:35:07.689,THIS NEVER HAPPENED.
00:35:07.689,00:35:09.858,YOU UNDERSTAND?
00:35:09.858,00:35:11.777,OF COURSE.
00:35:13.987,00:35:17.741,DO YOU THINK IT COULD NOT HAPPEN ONE MORE TIME?
00:35:25.248,00:35:26.708,HEY.
00:35:26.708,00:35:28.961,Are you with him?
00:35:28.961,00:35:30.003,WHAT?
00:35:30.003,00:35:31.630,DO NOT LIE TO ME RIGHT NOW!
00:35:31.630,00:35:33.673,I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
00:35:33.673,00:35:35.759,SAM!
00:35:35.759,00:35:37.552,NO. NO.
00:35:37.552,00:35:39.554,WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?
00:35:41.514,00:35:43.767,SOMETHING TERRIBLE'S HAPPENED.
00:35:43.767,00:35:50.107,"We fought last night after you left, and I told him THAT THE D.A. WAS GONNA FIND OUT THAT THE BABY WAS HIS."
00:35:50.107,00:35:52.191,"I'm worried, Bonnie."
00:35:52.191,00:35:58.740,"He thinks he's gonna go away for murder AND NOW HE'S NOT ANSWERING HIS PHONE, AND I'M -- WHAT IF HE'S DONE SOMETHING STUPID?"
00:35:58.740,00:35:59.825,Stay where you are.
00:35:59.825,00:36:01.743,I WILL BE RIGHT OVER.
00:36:01.743,00:36:02.911,Please hurry.
00:36:02.911,00:36:04.663,OF COURSE.
00:36:06.539,00:36:08.374,WHO'S THAT?
00:36:08.374,00:36:10.710,I HAVE TO GET TO THE OFFICE.
00:36:10.710,00:36:12.963,DO YOU NEED A RIDE? WE COULD GET BREAKFAST ON OUR WAY.
00:36:14.172,00:36:16.049,I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
00:36:36.194,00:36:37.821,Michaela: MRS. WALKER.
00:36:40.198,00:36:41.908,YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING.
00:36:41.908,00:36:43.368,PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN.
00:36:43.368,00:36:45.495,YOU MUST TAKE ME FOR SOME NEW KIND OF FOOL.
00:36:45.495,00:36:50.792,"I'M THE FOOL, AND I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU WOMAN-TO-WOMAN THAT I AM SO SORRY FOR MY BEHAVIOR LAST NIGHT."
00:36:50.792,00:36:59.885,"I AM NOT THAT GIRL, BUT WITH FINAL EXAMS AND PROFESSOR KEATING RELYING SO HEAVILY ON ME AND WANTING TO PLAN THE PERFECT WEDDING, I-I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN MYSELF."
00:36:59.885,00:37:06.975,"I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT SUCH AN ABSURD REACTION WILL NEVER, EVER HAPPEN AGAIN."
00:37:06.975,00:37:09.102,WHICH IS WHY I WANT TO GIVE YOU THIS.
00:37:23.658,00:37:25.869,Oliver: FEEL BETTER?
00:37:27.495,00:37:28.788,YEAH.
00:37:28.788,00:37:30.665,GOOD.
00:37:33.210,00:37:35.336,RIGHT.
00:37:35.336,00:37:38.631,SO...
00:37:38.631,00:37:40.800,WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?
00:37:55.732,00:37:57.358,I WAS HIGH.
00:37:59.277,00:38:00.946,WHAT?
00:38:00.946,00:38:02.864,I DON'T KNOW WHAT I TOOK.
00:38:00.946,00:38:09.121,"I JUST -- I WAS MIXING A BUNCH OF STUFF -- UH, SOME PILLS AND...THIS NEW STUFF I'D NEVER TRIED BEFORE."
00:38:09.121,00:38:11.414,I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T DO DRUGS.
00:38:12.331,00:38:14.251,I LIED.
00:38:18.713,00:38:22.008,"I HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM, OLIVER."
00:38:24.094,00:38:25.971,WHO'S THAT?
00:38:25.971,00:38:27.847,BONNIE.
00:38:27.847,00:38:29.057,WHAT DOES SHE WANT?
00:38:29.057,00:38:30.642,SHE NEEDS US BACK AT THE OFFICE.
00:38:30.642,00:38:32.769,ARE YOU SERIOUS?
00:38:32.769,00:38:34.729,YOU JUST TOLD ME YOU HAVE A DRUG ADDICTION.
00:38:34.729,00:38:36.898,WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
00:38:36.898,00:38:38.858,I KNOW.
00:38:38.858,00:38:40.318,AND WE WILL.
00:38:40.318,00:38:41.987,BUT MY BOSS NEEDS ME.
00:38:43.113,00:38:44.990,I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
00:38:50.620,00:38:52.705,IT COULD BE ABOUT REBECCA'S CASE.
00:38:54.916,00:38:59.671,SHE OBVIOUSLY HAD US ALL COME OVER HERE SO SHE COULD GET US ARRESTED AND THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.
00:38:59.671,00:39:02.132,Wes: YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
00:39:02.132,00:39:03.800,WE'LL BE FINE.
00:39:03.800,00:39:05.635,YEAH.
00:39:05.635,00:39:07.262,'CAUSE WE CAN TRUST YOU ABOUT ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.
00:39:07.262,00:39:10.140,YOU GUYS ARE THE WORST LIARS.
00:39:13.810,00:39:15.353,ENJOY THE BONFIRE?
00:39:16.855,00:39:19.607,"YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT."
00:39:19.607,00:39:20.900,WE WENT LAST-MINUTE.
00:39:20.900,00:39:23.195,"WELL, THANKS FOR THE LAST-MINUTE CALL."
00:39:23.195,00:39:25.238,"AND YOU, PRATT."
00:39:25.238,00:39:27.324,I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOMETHING OF MINE?
00:39:27.324,00:39:29.951,YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS?
00:39:29.951,00:39:31.410,WHERE'D YOU FIND THAT?
00:39:31.410,00:39:33.830,IT WAS ON THE PORCH WHEN I GOT HERE.
00:39:33.830,00:39:36.666,"POINT IS, IT'S UP FOR GRABS NOW."
00:39:40.837,00:39:43.715,Bonnie: GOOD. EVERYONE'S HERE NOW?
00:39:43.715,00:39:46.425,IT'S SATURDAY.
00:39:46.425,00:39:51.014,SOMETHING'S HAPPENED THAT ANNALISE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU ALL ABOUT.
00:39:57.687,00:39:59.397,Bonnie: I'LL GO GET THEM.
00:40:07.405,00:40:10.742,THE POLICE ARE GONNA ASK YOU A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT MY HUSBAND.
00:40:14.412,00:40:17.456,HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH LILA STANGARD.
00:40:18.875,00:40:21.044,AND I CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT.
00:40:30.136,00:40:32.305,ANSWERING HIS PHONE.
00:40:32.305,00:40:35.100,I-I THINK HE MIGHT'VE FLED.
00:40:35.100,00:40:37.269,SO...
00:40:37.269,00:40:48.947,"SORRY TO HAVE TO INVOLVE YOU ALL IN THIS, BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU WORKED ON REBECCA'S CASE, AND I NEED YOU ALL TO BE AS HONEST WITH THE POLICE AS POSSIBLE."
00:40:53.743,00:40:56.871,WILL YOU PROMISE THAT YOU'LL DO THAT FOR ME?
00:41:02.627,00:41:04.337,WHATEVER YOU NEED.
00:41:04.337,00:41:06.005,"Man: HEY, ASSHAT!"
00:41:06.005,00:41:07.173,"SOMETIME THIS YEAR, WILL YA?"
00:41:43.084,00:41:44.961,I'M SO SORRY.
00:42:11.863,00:42:13.948,THANK YOU.
00:00:13.138,00:00:16.391,Terrence: YOU BELIEVE HE MURDERED THE GIRL.
00:00:16.391,00:00:17.726,Annalise: YES.
00:00:17.726,00:00:20.145,WHY IS THAT?
00:00:20.145,00:00:22.021,BECAUSE HE'S GONE.
00:00:22.021,00:00:25.192,"MISSING, AS YOU TOLD OUR COLLEAGUES EARLIER."
00:00:25.192,00:00:27.194,YES.
00:00:27.194,00:00:32.908,"I JUST TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS OVER, THAT I WAS GONNA ASK THE D.A."
00:00:29.780,00:00:34.869,TO RUN A DNA TEST ON THE MEN IN LILA'S LIFE.
00:00:38.789,00:00:47.840,"MY ASSOCIATE HAD ONLY JUST TOLD ME THAT HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR, AND I WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT IT WASN'T TRUE, THAT THE TEST WAS GONNA SHOW THAT HE WASN'T THE FATHER."
00:00:47.840,00:00:51.218,"SO, YOU ONLY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE AFFAIR LAST NIGHT?"
00:00:53.052,00:00:55.347,THAT'S CORRECT.
00:00:55.347,00:00:56.682,HOW LONG DID IT GO ON?
00:00:56.682,00:00:58.559,Sam: JUST THE SUMMER.
00:00:58.559,00:01:02.563,"I MEAN, I WORRIED THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON, OF COURSE."
00:01:02.563,00:01:04.523,"I MEAN, HE WAS HER TEACHER."
00:01:04.523,00:01:06.608,SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.
00:01:06.608,00:01:10.278,BUT I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING FOR SURE.
00:01:10.278,00:01:12.322,AND THEN WHEN I TOLD HIM WHAT I'D DONE...
00:01:13.908,00:01:17.870,...THAT I WAS GONNA TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM ONE WAY OR THE OTHER...
00:01:17.870,00:01:19.413,HE GOT UPSET.
00:01:19.413,00:01:23.375,"THAT'S HOW FOUL YOU ARE, YOU DISGUSTING SLUT."
00:01:23.375,00:01:28.087,"AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW HE WAS SLEEPING WITH HER, THAT HE'D..."
00:01:34.469,00:01:40.893,"SO, YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THIS PHOTO WHEN IT BECAME PUBLIC."
00:01:44.646,00:01:46.231,I DID NOT.
00:01:49.276,00:01:53.614,WE DON'T OBSESS OVER EVERY DETAIL OF OUR LOVERS' BODIES.
00:01:53.614,00:01:55.991,AND YOU LEFT THE HOUSE AFTER YOU CONFRONTED YOUR HUSBAND?
00:01:55.991,00:02:08.211,"I DROVE TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE, AND I STAYED THERE SEVERAL HOURS UNTIL I CALMED MYSELF DOWN, AND THEN I WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AFTER A FEW HOURS, AND I JUST..."
00:02:08.211,00:02:10.130,SAM?
00:02:18.847,00:02:19.932,I JUST...
00:02:34.195,00:02:37.616,SAM!
00:02:51.797,00:03:00.639,"I MEAN, I'D JUST HOPED THAT IT WASN'T TRUE -- THAT HE HADN'T HURT THAT GIRL -- AND THAT WE COULD MAKE IT RIGHT."
00:03:05.644,00:03:07.479,I'M SO SORRY.
00:03:08.689,00:03:09.857,Annalise: DON'T BE.
00:03:12.400,00:03:14.444,BUT WHEN I WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE...
00:03:14.444,00:03:17.531,"I SWEAR, WE -- WE DIDN'T MEAN FOR THIS TO HAPPEN."
00:03:18.782,00:03:20.492,...HE WAS GONE.
00:03:20.492,00:03:24.496,"AND THAT'S WHEN YOU DECIDED THAT HE HAD FLED, AS OPPOSED TO STAYING WITH A PAL SOMEWHERE?"
00:03:24.496,00:03:27.415,"AND THEN HE WAS CHOKING HER, SO -- SO WE HIT HIM."
00:03:27.415,00:03:28.750,I...
00:03:28.750,00:03:30.585,I HIT HIM.
00:03:30.585,00:03:36.175,I'D ONLY JUST TOLD HIM THAT I WAS GONNA TELL THE WORLD THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM.
00:03:36.175,00:03:38.093,WOULDN'T YOU RUN?
00:03:38.093,00:03:41.638,YOU LISTEN TO ME CLOSELY AND DO EXACTLY AS I TELL YOU.
00:03:41.638,00:03:43.057,REMOVE THE BODY.
00:03:43.057,00:03:44.975,HE CANNOT STAY HERE.
00:03:44.975,00:03:47.061,"HEADS, WE GO BACK FOR THE BODY."
00:03:47.061,00:03:53.316,"YOUR DNA IS UNDER HIS NAILS, ON HIS SKIN, SO THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF IT IS TO BURN THE BODY."
00:03:53.316,00:03:54.735,WE GO BACK FOR THE BODY AND THEN WHAT?
00:03:54.735,00:03:56.611,WE DO WHAT WITH IT?
00:03:56.611,00:03:58.363,HAVE ANY OF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?
00:04:00.782,00:04:03.744,I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS A BAD IDEA.
00:04:03.744,00:04:05.787,"IF THEY KNOW YOU WERE HERE, THEY'LL -- THEY'LL BLAME YOU."
00:04:05.787,00:04:08.082,DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
00:04:09.583,00:04:11.043,Annalise: SO PLEASE COME HOME SAFE.
00:04:11.043,00:04:12.627,COME HOME SO WE CAN BE TOGETHER.
00:04:12.627,00:04:13.795,SAM -- ARE YOU WITH SAM?
00:04:13.795,00:04:15.797,NO. WHY?
00:04:15.797,00:04:19.342,"PROFESSOR KEATING, I -- NO."
00:04:19.342,00:04:21.344,"LISTEN, WHAT YOU DID TONIGHT HAD TO BE DONE."
00:04:21.344,00:04:24.514,"HE KILLED THAT GIRL, AND FOR THAT, HE DESERVED TO DIE."
00:04:25.515,00:04:26.767,TRUST ME.
00:04:31.105,00:04:36.193,"I GOT YOU INTO THIS, AND IT'S MY JOB TO GET YOU OUT OF IT."
00:04:38.112,00:04:40.906,NOW GO AND DO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD.
00:04:46.078,00:04:49.623,THIS FRIEND YOU VISITED -- CAN WE GET A NAME?
00:04:49.623,00:04:52.417,"YEAH, YOU KNOW HIM -- NATE LAHEY."
00:04:52.417,00:04:56.630,HE WAS FIRED FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT WHEN YOUR BOSS FOUND OUT WE WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
00:05:14.982,00:05:16.984,HOW'D IT GO?
00:05:16.984,00:05:19.527,THEY'RE GONNA SCHEDULE TIME TO TALK TO YOU AND THE STUDENTS.
00:05:19.527,00:05:20.654,STAY HERE.
00:05:28.162,00:05:29.871,I'M SORRY.
00:05:29.871,00:05:31.790,THEY ASKED ME WHO I WAS WITH.
00:05:31.790,00:05:33.292,IT'S OKAY.
00:05:34.668,00:05:36.503,ANY IDEA WHERE HE WENT?
00:05:36.503,00:05:38.755,"NO, AND THEY'RE NOT TELLING ME IF THEY HAVE ANY LEADS."
00:05:38.755,00:05:40.590,THAT'S NORMAL.
00:05:40.590,00:05:42.009,"I MEAN, I WOULDN'T TELL YOU, EITHER, IF IT WAS MY CASE."
00:05:42.009,00:05:43.844,THEY'LL FIND HIM.
00:05:43.844,00:05:45.637,DON'T WORRY.
00:05:51.852,00:05:53.312,I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
00:05:58.483,00:06:00.485,Wes: THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
00:06:00.485,00:06:02.946,REALLY?
00:06:00.485,00:06:05.532,"'CAUSE LAST I HEARD, WE WERE ALL BEING INTERVIEWED BY THE POLICE."
00:06:05.532,00:06:07.284,BECAUSE WE WORK AT HER HOUSE.
00:06:07.284,00:06:09.703,"WE NEED TO STAY CALM, STICK TO THE STORY."
00:06:12.664,00:06:16.084,"THAT SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING, AND SHE'S USING THESE INTERVIEWS TO GET ONE OF US TO CONFESS."
00:06:16.084,00:06:20.130,"I MEAN, HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE CAMPUS COP DIDN'T CALL HER LAST NIGHT AND SAY, OH -- CONNOR."
00:06:23.050,00:06:27.137,"WHAT IF ONE OF US CRACKS, HMM, GOES TO THE POLICE AND TRIES TO GET A LESSER CHARGE?"
00:06:30.182,00:06:34.311,"IT'S FOUR AGAINST ONE, SO DON'T EVEN TRY IT."
00:06:36.771,00:06:38.232,MOMMY'S HOME.
00:06:40.025,00:06:41.985,THE POLICE ASKED US TO WAIT OUTSIDE.
00:06:41.985,00:06:48.367,"WE DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN THEIR WAY, WHICH REMINDS ME, ARE WE GONNA BE EXCUSED FROM THE FINAL EXAM NOW THAT WE'RE INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION?"
00:06:48.367,00:06:50.744,"NOT A CHANCE, MS. PRATT."
00:06:50.744,00:06:53.330,"MR. GIBBINS, MY OFFICE."
00:06:55.665,00:06:57.125,DO YOU BLAME THEM?
00:06:57.125,00:06:59.002,"PLEASE, JUST LET ME TELL THEM."
00:06:59.002,00:07:00.545,NO.
00:07:00.545,00:07:03.673,IF THEY KNEW YOU WERE HELPING US -- I'M NOT HELPING YOU.
00:07:09.763,00:07:15.476,THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THE INTERVIEWS IS IF THEY KNOW AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE ABOUT MY INVOLVEMENT.
00:07:15.476,00:07:17.229,THAT INCLUDES REBECCA.
00:07:17.229,00:07:20.399,I HAVEN'T TOLD HER.
00:07:20.399,00:07:21.816,GOOD.
00:07:21.816,00:07:24.736,LOOK WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME YOU TOLD HER ONE OF OUR SECRETS.
00:07:30.867,00:07:33.620,"LOOK, LOOK."
00:07:33.620,00:07:36.497,"EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?"
00:07:36.497,00:07:38.499,WE'LL RUN THE DNA TEST.
00:07:44.256,00:07:45.966,WHAT IF IT DOESN'T?
00:07:45.966,00:07:47.968,IT WILL.
00:07:47.968,00:07:50.929,AND THEN WE'LL GET THE CHARGES AGAINST REBECCA DROPPED.
00:07:58.395,00:07:59.938,LOOK AT ME.
00:08:01.440,00:08:08.113,"I'VE SEEN HOW STRONG YOU CAN BE, AND THAT'S THE WES I NEED FOR YOU TO BE RIGHT NOW, TO HELP THE OTHERS."
00:08:12.909,00:08:15.287,UM...
00:08:15.287,00:08:16.830,HERE.
00:08:16.830,00:08:18.498,SAM'S RING.
00:08:18.498,00:08:21.918,I TOOK IT OFF RIGHT BEFORE WE...
00:08:21.918,00:08:24.712,I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT IT.
00:08:29.926,00:08:32.346,THANK YOU.
00:08:34.181,00:08:35.807,YES?
00:08:35.807,00:08:38.226,YOU SHOULD COME.
00:08:38.226,00:08:39.853,I SAID YOU COULD WAIT OUTSIDE.
00:08:43.731,00:08:46.401,HE'S BEEN GONE FOR HOW LONG NOW -- 15 HOURS?
00:08:46.401,00:08:48.153,YOU THINK THIS IS A GAME?
00:08:48.153,00:08:54.201,"I THINK YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR ODDS IN REBECCA'S TRIAL, AND THIS IS HOW BADLY YOU NEED TO WIN, EVEN IF IT MEANS THROWING YOUR OWN HUSBAND UNDER THE BUS."
00:08:54.201,00:08:56.244,WHY? DID HE FINALLY TELL YOU HE WAS LEAVING YOU?
00:08:56.244,00:08:57.829,IS THIS YOUR VERSION OF A WOMAN SCORNED?
00:08:57.829,00:09:04.211,"I JUST FOUND OUT THAT MY HUSBAND WAS SLEEPING WITH A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS KILLED, AND YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO COME IN HERE AND MOCK ME?"
00:09:04.211,00:09:06.838,"GET OUT NOW, OR I'LL THROW YOU OUT."
00:09:06.838,00:09:08.798,YOUR HUSBAND DIDN'T KILL LILA STANGARD.
00:09:08.798,00:09:15.263,"THAT WAS MISS SUTTER AND MR. O'REILLY, AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO PUT THEM IN JAIL."
00:09:16.348,00:09:18.099,"SEE YOU IN COURT, KIDS."
00:09:30.611,00:09:33.031,Terrence: CAN YOU TELL US WHERE YOU WERE LAST NIGHT?
00:09:33.031,00:09:35.825,I WAS AT MY APARTMENT WITH MY STUDY GROUP.
00:09:35.825,00:09:38.119,WE HAVE EXAMS THIS WEEK.
00:09:38.119,00:09:40.205,DID YOU DO ANYTHING AFTER THAT?
00:09:40.205,00:09:42.207,WE STOPPED AT THE BONFIRE ON CAMPUS.
00:09:42.207,00:09:45.502,DID YOU SEE MR. KEATING DURING ANY OF THIS?
00:09:48.547,00:09:51.466,NO.
00:09:51.466,00:09:54.261,THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM WAS TWO DAYS AGO.
00:09:54.261,00:09:58.139,WE WERE WORKING ON ONE OF OUR CASES WHEN HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE.
00:09:58.139,00:10:01.435,NOTICE ANYTHING ABOUT HIS DEMEANOR?
00:10:01.435,00:10:03.644,OH!
00:10:03.644,00:10:08.483,"I NEVER REALLY PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO HIM, TO BE HONEST."
00:10:08.483,00:10:16.699,"I WAS MORE FOCUSED ON PREPARING REBECCA SUTTER'S DEFENSE FOR TRIAL, WHICH REMINDS ME, I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING."
00:10:16.699,00:10:18.659,REBECCA'S MY GIRLFRIEND.
00:10:18.659,00:10:20.328,YOU'RE DATING YOUR CLIENT?
00:10:21.455,00:10:23.623,I'M JUST A 1-L.
00:10:23.623,00:10:26.626,IT'S NOT AGAINST THE LAW.
00:10:26.626,00:10:29.129,"REBECCA, I NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU."
00:10:29.129,00:10:30.922,FOR WHAT?
00:10:40.056,00:10:44.603,"IF I HAD, THEN THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU AND GRIFFIN WOULD HAVE BEEN DROPPED ALREADY."
00:10:44.603,00:10:46.229,YOU WANTED TO BELIEVE HE WAS A GOOD GUY.
00:10:46.229,00:10:48.356,I GET IT.
00:10:48.356,00:10:51.359,I'M GONNA GET THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU DROPPED.
00:10:51.359,00:10:54.154,"HOPEFULLY, BEFORE THE TRIAL."
00:10:54.154,00:10:56.906,I PROMISE.
00:10:56.906,00:10:58.783,OKAY.
00:10:58.783,00:11:00.827,THANKS.
00:11:00.827,00:11:02.829,ARE YOU SURE SHE DOESN'T KNOW?
00:11:02.829,00:11:04.080,OF COURSE NOT.
00:11:04.080,00:11:06.541,SHE APOLOGIZED TO ME.
00:11:06.541,00:11:09.127,THAT'S NOT SOMETHING SHE DOES -- EVER.
00:11:14.048,00:11:15.842,SHE DOESN'T KNOW.
00:11:25.101,00:11:26.561,"NO, YOU'RE NOT."
00:11:26.561,00:11:28.771,YOU'RE NORMAL.
00:11:28.771,00:11:30.773,"WHICH, TO BE HONEST, IS FREAKING ME OUT."
00:11:37.696,00:11:40.825,OTHERWISE WE GET CAUGHT.
00:11:40.825,00:11:43.953,WE'RE ALL GONNA BE OKAY.
00:11:58.051,00:11:59.802,I HAVE EVERYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
00:11:59.802,00:12:02.514,I CAME HERE LAST NIGHT LOOKING FOR THE TROPHY.
00:12:04.474,00:12:07.394,WHAT IF THEY THINK THAT THERE'S FOUL PLAY AND I'M SOMEHOW INVOLVED?
00:12:09.604,00:12:11.064,PROFESSOR KEATING.
00:12:11.064,00:12:12.566,Annalise: WE HAVE WORK TO DO.
00:12:12.566,00:12:16.819,REBECCA GOES TO TRIAL IN THREE DAYS UNLESS WE GET THE CHARGES AGAINST HER DISMISSED.
00:12:16.819,00:12:18.655,"NOW, HOW DO WE DO THAT?"
00:12:25.870,00:12:27.914,"FIRST, WE NEED MOTIVE."
00:12:27.914,00:12:30.791,Laurel: IS THIS EVEN GONNA BE ADMISSIBLE?
00:12:30.791,00:12:34.588,"I MEAN, WON'T THE COURT WANT TO OBTAIN THEIR OWN DNA SAMPLE OF SAM?"
00:12:34.588,00:12:37.215,"OF COURSE, BUT WE NEED SOMETHING TO PRESENT TO THE COURT."
00:12:37.215,00:12:38.757,THEN THEY CAN DO THEIR OWN TEST.
00:12:40.051,00:12:41.928,YOU EVER GONNA SAY THANK YOU?
00:12:42.970,00:12:44.847,FOR THE TROPHY.
00:12:44.847,00:12:47.267,DOUCHEFACE TOTALLY FELL FOR IT.
00:12:47.267,00:12:48.309,RIGHT. THANKS.
00:12:48.309,00:12:50.103,HEY.
00:12:50.103,00:12:52.188,"YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT, FRANK."
00:12:52.188,00:12:53.732,A LONG-DISTANCE GIRLFRIEND.
00:12:53.732,00:12:55.900,"AND WHAT ABOUT, UH, LEGAL AID GUY?"
00:12:55.900,00:12:57.818,"I LIED TO HIM, NOT YOU."
00:12:57.818,00:12:59.320,IT'S DIFFERENT.
00:12:59.320,00:13:00.363,IS IT?
00:13:00.363,00:13:02.823,"WE'RE OVER, SO...STOP."
00:13:02.823,00:13:04.867,PLEASE.
00:13:04.867,00:13:11.040,"NEXT, WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT SAM HAD THE MEANS TO KILL LILA, THAT HE WAS IN PHILADELPHIA THE NIGHT SHE WAS KILLED."
00:13:11.040,00:13:15.545,"WE HAVE PROOF THAT HE LEFT THE HOTEL PARKING GARAGE IN NEW HAVEN, BUT WE NEED MORE."
00:13:15.545,00:13:18.214,WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT HE DROVE BACK HERE THAT NIGHT.
00:13:18.214,00:13:21.217,"SO, WHAT ARE YOU ON RIGHT NOW?"
00:13:21.217,00:13:22.761,ADDERALL? HEROIN?
00:13:22.761,00:13:24.429,I SAID I WOULD GET HELP AFTER EXAMS.
00:13:24.429,00:13:25.472,I'M SURE.
00:13:25.472,00:13:27.390,OLIVER.
00:13:27.390,00:13:30.560,"YOU NEED TO HELP YOUR BOSS PROVE HER HUSBAND'S A MURDERER, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO WORRY ABOUT YOURSELF RIGHT NOW."
00:13:30.560,00:13:32.186,I GET IT.
00:13:32.186,00:13:38.234,"SO, THAT GUY WHO WAS HERE THE OTHER NIGHT, THE ONE WITH THE BICEPS, HE WASN'T HERE LAST NIGHT."
00:13:38.234,00:13:39.986,WHEN YOU WERE HAVING YOUR DRUG-INDUCED BREAKDOWN?
00:13:39.986,00:13:41.195,NOPE.
00:13:41.195,00:13:44.240,"AND YOU DON'T GET TO ASK ME ABOUT WHO I'M DATING RIGHT NOW, SO..."
00:13:44.240,00:13:46.867,RIGHT.
00:13:46.867,00:13:52.123,"HE GOT BACK TOGETHER WITH HIS EX, SOME UNDERWEAR MODEL OR -- WHATEVER."
00:13:52.123,00:13:53.750,YOU DON'T GET TO KNOW ANY OF THIS.
00:13:53.750,00:13:56.544,FINALLY -- HERE WE GO.
00:13:56.544,00:14:01.716,"ACCORDING TO SPEEDY-PASS, HE TOOK I-95 UP TO NEW HAVEN ON THE 28th AND RETURNED SEPTEMBER 4th."
00:14:05.470,00:14:06.471,NOTHING.
00:14:08.264,00:14:11.434,MAYBE HE PAID CASH AT THE TOLLS OR TOOK THE TRAIN.
00:14:11.434,00:14:13.436,HE CHECKED HIS CAR OUT OF THE HOTEL GARAGE.
00:14:13.436,00:14:15.313,MAYBE HE DROVE TO THE TRAIN STATION.
00:14:15.313,00:14:17.440,HIS CREDIT-CARD RECEIPTS DON'T HAVE HIM BUYING A TICKET.
00:14:17.440,00:14:19.066,THEY'RE MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY TO TRACK HIM.
00:14:23.780,00:14:32.622,"MOST PHONES RECORD WHEREVER YOU GO, SO IF SAM BACKED UP HIS PHONE TO THE LAPTOP, THERE COULD BE DATA SHOWING HE WAS AT THE SORORITY HOUSE THAT NIGHT."
00:14:32.622,00:14:34.499,GREAT IDEA.
00:14:34.499,00:14:39.504,"BONNIE, I WANT YOU TO GO DOWN TO THE POLICE STATION TO RETRIEVE SAM'S LAPTOP."
00:14:44.759,00:14:47.679,"SO, I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CRAZY STUFF GOING DOWN RIGHT NOW."
00:14:47.679,00:14:49.597,YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS HERE.
00:14:49.597,00:14:53.267,I'M JUST SAYING I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
00:14:53.267,00:14:54.644,TRY HARDER.
00:14:54.644,00:14:56.604,DID YOUR BOSS GIVE YOU THE OKAY?
00:14:56.604,00:15:01.693,"SORRY, THE RECORDS SAY THE LAPTOP'S BEING HELD PENDING REVIEW BY D.A. PARKS' OFFICE."
00:15:01.693,00:15:04.945,"OKAY, WENDY PARKS IS ON RECORD SAYING SAM KEATING ISN'T A SUSPECT HERE."
00:15:04.945,00:15:07.990,SHE'S ONLY KEEPING IT SO SHE CAN BURY EVIDENCE SHE KNOWS WILL WEAKEN HER CASE.
00:15:07.990,00:15:09.409,"HEY, I'M JUST THE WEEKEND GUY."
00:15:10.702,00:15:12.579,Laurel: ASHER JUST TEXTED ME.
00:15:15.498,00:15:16.708,THAT MEANS THE D.A.
00:15:15.498,00:15:20.420,PROBABLY THINKS THERE'S SOMETHING ON IT THAT'LL HURT THEIR CASE AGAINST REBECCA.
00:15:20.420,00:15:26.885,"Michaela: OR, DUMBASS, IT MEANS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE TO PLACE SAM AT THE MURDER SCENE, WHICH MEANS NO ONE WILL BELIEVE THAT HE'S ON THE RUN, WHICH MEANS WE BECOME SUSPECTS."
00:15:26.885,00:15:28.177,"HELLO, RASKOLNIKOV."
00:15:29.970,00:15:36.477,"CRIME AND PUNISHMENT -- THE GUILT EATS AWAY AT HIM UNTIL HE GOES CRAY, AND THEN HE TURNS HIMSELF IN."
00:15:36.477,00:15:43.443,"LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING THAT WE SHOULD GET DRUNK, ENJOY OUR LAST DAYS OF FREEDOM BEFORE ANNALISE GIVES US UP."
00:15:43.443,00:15:45.737,HOW WOULD ANNALISE KNOW ANYTHING?
00:15:45.737,00:15:47.614,"I MEAN, MAYBE LAUREL TOLD HER BOYFRIEND."
00:15:47.614,00:15:49.365,"I DIDN'T TELL FRANK, OKAY?"
00:15:49.365,00:15:50.491,AND WES IS RIGHT.
00:15:52.535,00:15:56.205,"EXCEPT THE CAMPUS COP, RIGHT -- I MEAN THE ONE THAT SAW US CARRYING THE BODY OUT OF THE HOUSE -- HE KNOWS SOME STUFF."
00:15:56.205,00:15:58.082,EVERYONE NEEDS TO CALM DOWN.
00:15:58.082,00:16:00.460,LET'S JUST FOCUS ON THIS CASE LIKE WE WOULD ANY OTHER.
00:16:00.460,00:16:02.253,OUR CASE IS A WASH.
00:16:02.253,00:16:03.963,"YOU DO KNOW THAT I'M SITTING RIGHT HERE, RIGHT?"
00:16:03.963,00:16:09.427,"HERE'S THE THING -- EVEN IF WE CAN PROVE THAT LILA WAS PREGNANT WITH SAM'S BABY, THAT'S NOT A MOTIVE."
00:16:09.427,00:16:11.137,IT IS IF SHE TOLD HIM SHE WAS GONNA HAVE IT.
00:16:12.972,00:16:15.600,LILA ASKED ME WHAT CLINIC I GET MY BIRTH CONTROL AT.
00:16:15.600,00:16:17.017,"SHE WAS PREGNANT, IDIOT."
00:16:17.017,00:16:18.812,SHE CLEARLY WASN'T ON BIRTH CONTROL.
00:16:18.812,00:16:22.732,"NO, BUT SHE ASKED ME THE WEEK THAT SHE DIED, WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE ALREADY KNOWN SHE WAS PREGNANT."
00:16:22.732,00:16:24.317,LILA WOULD HAVE BEEN WEIRD ABOUT GETTING AN ABORTION.
00:16:24.317,00:16:25.860,MAYBE SAM WANTED HER TO GET ONE.
00:16:25.860,00:16:27.946,THAT'S WHY SHE ASKED ABOUT THE CLINIC.
00:16:27.946,00:16:29.614,"THAT WOULD PROVE MOTIVE, RIGHT?"
00:16:29.614,00:16:31.991,WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE CLINIC?
00:16:31.991,00:16:33.785,Annalise: THE WEISENSTOCK WOMEN'S CLINIC.
00:16:33.785,00:16:35.286,"Parks: THIS IS A BOONDOGGLE, YOUR HONOR."
00:16:35.286,00:16:42.710,SHE'S DRAGGED US IN HERE ON A WEEKEND IN ORDER TO GET MISS SUTTER AND MR. O'REILLY'S CASE THROWN OUT AND IMPLICATE HER HUSBAND IN THE MURDER OF LILA STANGARD.
00:16:42.710,00:16:44.211,"IS THIS TRUE, MS. KEATING?"
00:16:44.211,00:16:48.257,I RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT MY HUSBAND WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MISS STANGARD.
00:16:48.257,00:16:49.342,Parks: ALLEGEDLY.
00:16:49.342,00:16:52.219,I'M RUNNING A DNA TEST TO PROVE THAT HE'S THE FATHER OF HER BABY.
00:16:52.219,00:16:55.807,"REGARDLESS, THE FACT IS, IS THAT MISS STANGARD WENT TO AN ABORTION CLINIC."
00:16:55.807,00:16:57.767,A WOMEN'S CLINIC THAT HAPPENS TO DO ABORTIONS.
00:16:57.767,00:17:03.189,IF WE COULD OBTAIN THE RECORDS FROM THAT APPOINTMENT -- RECORDS THAT ARE PERMITTED DISCLOSURE UNDER HIPAA -- THEY'LL PROVE INTENT.
00:17:03.189,00:17:07.318,IF YOU WERE ABLE TO SHOW ME COMPELLING EVIDENCE BEYOND MERE CONJECTURE.
00:17:07.318,00:17:09.195,"I'M SORRY, MS. KEATING, BUT I'M DENYING YOUR REQUEST."
00:17:09.195,00:17:11.280,"YOUR HONOR -- GO HOME, ANNALISE."
00:17:11.280,00:17:12.907,AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
00:17:22.124,00:17:26.963,"Nate: THEIR QUESTIONS WERE WHAT YOU'D EXPECT -- ABOUT US, OUR HISTORY."
00:17:26.963,00:17:28.882,PRETTY STANDARD FOR THE MOST PART.
00:17:28.882,00:17:31.258,FOR THE MOST PART?
00:17:32.468,00:17:34.721,NATE?
00:17:36.055,00:17:38.558,"I'M A COP, ANNALISE."
00:17:38.558,00:17:43.270,YOU DON'T THINK I CAN IGNORE THE FACT THAT YOU WERE WITH ME AT THE SAME TIME SAM WENT MISSING?
00:17:43.270,00:17:46.482,YOU THINK I KNOW SOMETHING?
00:17:46.482,00:17:48.943,I'M AN IDIOT IF I DON'T ASK.
00:17:51.654,00:17:56.242,I...CAME TO YOU BECAUSE I NEEDED YOU.
00:18:09.589,00:18:15.469,I JUST -- I NEEDED TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.
00:18:20.016,00:18:22.852,I'M SO SCARED.
00:18:22.852,00:18:24.771,I KNOW.
00:18:39.326,00:18:42.329,Terrence: AND THAT'S WHEN YOU WENT TO THE BONFIRE?
00:18:42.329,00:18:47.460,"NO, I WENT TO WES' FOR OUR STUDY GROUP FIRST, THEN WE WENT."
00:18:47.460,00:18:51.130,"IN GENERAL, DID YOU HAVE MUCH CONTACT WITH MR. KEATING?"
00:18:51.130,00:18:53.674,A LITTLE.
00:18:53.674,00:18:54.842,LAUREL!
00:18:57.845,00:19:02.182,"WE WORKED OUT OF HIS HOUSE, SO..."
00:19:02.182,00:19:03.810,MISS CASTILLO...
00:19:03.810,00:19:07.105,IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT TELLING US...
00:19:09.941,00:19:13.235,IS PROFESSOR KEATING GONNA HEAR ANY OF THIS?
00:19:13.235,00:19:14.737,Terrence: NO.
00:19:14.737,00:19:17.531,ANYTHING THAT'S SAID IN HERE IS BETWEEN US.
00:19:20.242,00:19:22.745,UM...
00:19:22.745,00:19:28.126,SOMETIMES MR. KEATING WOULD...
00:19:28.126,00:19:30.044,LOOK AT ME.
00:19:34.507,00:19:36.009,LOOK AT YOU?
00:19:36.009,00:19:38.594,IN A SEXUAL WAY.
00:19:38.594,00:19:41.681,"PLEASE, DON'T TELL PROFESSOR KEATING ABOUT THIS."
00:19:41.681,00:19:44.183,I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE WOULD DO.
00:19:44.183,00:19:47.227,DO YOU THINK SAM REALLY RAN AWAY?
00:19:47.227,00:19:50.648,"I MEAN, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ANNALISE."
00:19:50.648,00:19:54.068,WHO KNOWS HOW TRUE HER STORY IS OR IF THE POLICE EVEN BELIEVE IT?
00:19:54.068,00:19:56.696,YOU SAYING YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT?
00:19:58.072,00:19:59.239,DO YOU?
00:20:01.617,00:20:04.203,WHY ARE YOU ASKING?
00:20:05.538,00:20:10.918,"I GUESS I'M JUST, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IT, JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE."
00:20:10.918,00:20:12.461,"WELL, STOP."
00:20:12.461,00:20:14.213,IT'S NOT YOUR JOB.
00:20:15.339,00:20:17.341,RIGHT.
00:20:23.890,00:20:25.725,NO ONE ELSE IS THINKING CLEARLY ABOUT THIS.
00:20:26.642,00:20:28.394,EXCEPT US.
00:20:31.230,00:20:32.690,WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS HERE.
00:20:32.690,00:20:38.445,MICHAELA -- I'M TRYING TO FIND A PRECEDENT TO CONVINCE A JUDGE TO GIVE US ACCESS TO LILA'S CLINIC FILES.
00:20:38.445,00:20:39.989,HELP.
00:20:39.989,00:20:42.408,"LOOK, REBECCA WAS THE ONE THAT BROKE IN."
00:20:42.408,00:20:44.451,WES WAS THE ONE THAT GAVE THE FINAL BLOW.
00:20:44.451,00:20:48.873,"TECHNICALLY, SAM WAS STILL ALIVE WHEN YOU PUSHED HIM OFF -- I DID NOT PUSH HIM."
00:20:48.873,00:20:51.250,"LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING THAT..."
00:20:51.250,00:20:54.170,WE CAN SAVE OURSELVES.
00:20:54.170,00:21:00.009,"GO TO THE D.A. AND SAY THAT -- THAT WE WERE IN SHOCK, PLEAD TO A FELONY."
00:21:02.011,00:21:04.889,"YEAH, BUT -- NOT OUR CAREERS."
00:21:04.889,00:21:10.603,"LOOK, A FELONY CONVICTION WON'T STOP US FROM SITTING FOR THE BAR."
00:21:10.603,00:21:12.271,WE STILL GET TO BE LAWYERS.
00:21:12.271,00:21:13.773,AND AIDEN?
00:21:13.773,00:21:17.068,DO YOU WANT TO BE MARRIED OR GO TO JAIL?
00:21:17.068,00:21:19.153,WHAT'S GOING ON?
00:21:19.153,00:21:22.115,"JUST WITHOUT THE CLINIC FILES, WE'RE TOTALLY SCREWED."
00:21:22.115,00:21:25.659,TO SAY THE LEAST.
00:21:35.920,00:21:37.922,"Bonnie: I JUST TALKED TO KEEGAN, GRIFFIN'S LAWYER."
00:21:37.922,00:21:40.007,HE'S AGREED TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES FOR NOW.
00:21:40.007,00:21:41.467,OF COURSE HE HAS.
00:21:41.467,00:21:43.594,WE'RE DOING ALL OF HIS WORK FOR HIM.
00:21:46.847,00:21:48.515,WHAT?
00:21:48.515,00:21:51.310,WE HAVEN'T TALKED -- ABOUT HOW WE LEFT THINGS.
00:21:51.310,00:21:53.104,"WELL, EVERYTHING'S CHANGED."
00:21:53.104,00:21:55.231,WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT.
00:21:58.276,00:22:03.322,"THIS HAS GOT TO BE HARD, ANNALISE, EVEN FOR YOU."
00:22:03.322,00:22:08.494,SO I'M HERE IF YOU EVER NEED TO TALK.
00:22:13.207,00:22:14.959,I'M GOOD.
00:22:17.795,00:22:20.464,"PROFESSOR KEATING, I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING."
00:22:20.464,00:22:24.677,THE WEISENSTOCK WOMEN'S CLINIC HAS SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN THEIR WAITING ROOM.
00:22:24.677,00:22:26.470,THE JUDGE SAID HANDS OFF THE MEDICAL CLINIC.
00:22:26.470,00:22:29.765,"I KNOW, BUT THERE'S A PRECEDENT WE CAN USE -- COMMONWEALTH v. G.P."
00:22:29.765,00:22:33.644,"IT SAYS, OBSERVATIONS OF PATIENTS IN CLINICS ARE NOT COMMUNICATIONS AND..."
00:22:33.644,00:22:42.695,"...THEREFORE ARE NOT PRIVILEGED, WHICH MEANS THE PHYSICIAN-PATIENT PRIVILEGE DOES NOT APPLY, SO I'D LIKE TO REQUEST A SUBPOENA FOR THE SECURITY FOOTAGE FROM THE CLINIC'S WAITING ROOM."
00:22:42.695,00:22:46.324,THE LAW PROHIBITS THE INTIMIDATION OF WOMEN ENTERING AN ABORTION CLINIC.
00:22:46.324,00:22:48.534,THERE'S A LESSER EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IN A WAITING ROOM.
00:22:48.534,00:22:52.830,"YOUR HONOR, THESE CLINICS NEED TO BE IN A PROTECTED ZONE."
00:22:52.830,00:23:00.004,"PROTECTED FROM OUTSIDERS WHO OBJECT TO WHAT GOES ON WITHIN, BUT IT'S NOT PROTECTION OF THOSE WHOSE IDENTITIES CAN BE KNOWN TO ANYONE WHO WALKS IN THE DOOR."
00:23:00.004,00:23:03.799,WOMEN WHOSE PRIVACY WILL BE VIOLATED DUE TO THIS REQUEST -- NO ONE'S PRIVACY WILL BE VIOLATED.
00:23:03.799,00:23:08.262,I'M MANDATING THAT THE FOOTAGE ONLY BE VIEWED IN A SECURE ROOM INSIDE THIS COURTHOUSE.
00:23:09.847,00:23:11.891,"THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR."
00:23:20.566,00:23:22.235,DNA RESULTS.
00:23:28.532,00:23:30.284,Frank: YOU WANT ME TO GO?
00:23:32.953,00:23:34.705,STAY.
00:23:52.723,00:23:54.100,HE'S THE FATHER.
00:23:57.519,00:23:59.772,"WHAT THE HELL, ANNALISE?"
00:23:59.772,00:24:05.819,"NO ONE'S THIS RELIEVED WHEN THEY FIND OUT THEIR HUSBAND KNOCKED UP A DEAD GIRL, NOT UNLESS SOMETHING'S GOING ON."
00:24:07.613,00:24:08.781,TALK TO ME.
00:24:08.781,00:24:10.991,THAT WAY I CAN HELP YOU.
00:24:12.076,00:24:13.577,OKAY.
00:24:15.204,00:24:17.790,BONNIE CAN NEVER KNOW.
00:24:28.926,00:24:34.765,"I WAS JUST PRE-GAMING, YOU KNOW, PUTTING ON THE WAR PAINT, GETTING TURNT UP BEFORE THE BONFIRE."
00:24:34.765,00:24:37.184,THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED THE TROPHY WAS GONE.
00:24:37.184,00:24:39.186,A TROPHY PROFESSOR KEATING GAVE TO YOU.
00:24:39.186,00:24:40.604,SHE AWARDED IT TO ME.
00:24:48.695,00:24:56.620,"I FIGURED SHE WAS TURNING IT IN TO GET OUT OF THE EXAM, WHICH IS A BALLBUSTER, BY THE WAY, AND RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER, SO, MY PEEPS, IF WE CAN HURRY THIS UP."
00:24:56.620,00:25:00.374,"NO ONE WAS AT THE HOUSE WHEN YOU GOT THERE, RIGHT?"
00:25:02.126,00:25:05.963,"I'M, LIKE, THE MOST GROWN-UP GROWN-UP EVER COMPARED TO YOUR DUMB ASSES."
00:25:05.963,00:25:07.798,NO.
00:25:07.798,00:25:13.220,WHICH WAS WEIRD BECAUSE CONNOR'S S.U.V.
00:25:13.220,00:25:15.139,"YEAH, BUT NOBODY ANSWERED WHEN YOU KNOCKED?"
00:25:15.139,00:25:17.599,NOPE.
00:25:17.599,00:25:21.061,"LOOK, I WAS ONLY AT THE HOUSE FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES BEFORE I LEFT AND CHECKED AT THE BONFIRE."
00:25:21.061,00:25:25.065,THEN I GOT A CALL FROM A LADY FRIEND WHO WANTED COME OVER TO MY PLACE FOR...
00:25:26.150,00:25:27.901,"I MEAN, YOU KNOW."
00:25:27.901,00:25:31.697,AND HOW LONG HAS THIS RELATIONSHIP BEEN GOING ON?
00:25:31.697,00:25:34.700,MR. MILLSTONE AND I ARE NOT IN A RELATIONSHIP.
00:25:34.700,00:25:38.412,IT WAS A -- A ONE-TIME THING.
00:25:38.412,00:25:40.580,"COME HERE, YOU IDIOT."
00:25:40.580,00:25:49.798,"I THINK WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW IS WHAT TIME I LEFT THE HOUSE, WHICH WAS AROUND 9:00, RIGHT AFTER I TOLD ANNALISE THAT SAM KNEW LILA WAS PREGNANT."
00:25:49.798,00:25:51.467,WHICH SAM TOLD YOU.
00:25:51.467,00:25:56.013,"I ASKED HIM, AND HE DIDN'T CORRECT ME."
00:25:58.932,00:26:04.104,"IN FACT, HE MADE A PASS AT ME SO I'D STAY QUIET."
00:26:04.104,00:26:07.816,I THINK ANY MAN THAT'D DO THAT IS A MAN WHO'D SKIP TOWN.
00:26:07.816,00:26:09.735,MILLSTONE.
00:26:11.111,00:26:12.570,I WASN'T STUDYING FOR THE EXAM.
00:26:12.570,00:26:14.907,IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
00:26:16.075,00:26:17.493,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
00:26:17.493,00:26:19.328,IT'S THE PO-PO.
00:26:19.328,00:26:21.330,I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO THINK I WAS HIDING ANYTHING.
00:26:21.330,00:26:23.290,THERE'S NOTHING TO HIDE BECAUSE IT'S NEVER HAPPENING AGAIN.
00:26:23.290,00:26:24.291,DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
00:26:24.291,00:26:25.751,COME ON.
00:26:25.751,00:26:27.211,WE HAD FUN.
00:26:27.211,00:26:29.171,I WAS DRUNK AND DESPERATE.
00:26:30.672,00:26:34.134,"HEY, I FOUND SOMETHING."
00:26:42.935,00:26:44.602,Laurel: THERE'S LILA.
00:26:46.063,00:26:47.647,AND THAT'S SAM.
00:26:52.986,00:26:56.115,LOOKS LIKE SHE'S TELLING HIM SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.
00:27:02.871,00:27:05.124,PAUSE IT.
00:27:05.124,00:27:07.751,MAYBE SHE CAN TELL US FOR SURE.
00:27:10.670,00:27:15.842,I DON'T THINK DR. TURNER SPENT MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES TALKING TO HER BEFORE SHE CAME BACK OUT.
00:27:15.842,00:27:18.053,AND HOW DID MR. KEATING REACT TO THAT?
00:27:18.053,00:27:20.598,"HE SEEMED, YEAH, PRETTY ANGRY."
00:27:20.598,00:27:23.517,"LIKE, CLEARLY, HE WANTED HER TO GO THROUGH WITH IT."
00:27:23.517,00:27:32.276,"YOUR HONOR, IN ADDITION TO THE VIDEO, I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE FINDINGS FROM AN INDEPENDENT LAB, CONFIRMING THAT SAM KEATING WAS THE FATHER OF MISS STANGARD'S UNBORN CHILD."
00:27:32.276,00:27:34.612,"CHAIN OF CUSTODY, YOUR HONOR."
00:27:34.612,00:27:35.946,RUN AS MANY TESTS AS YOU LIKE.
00:27:35.946,00:27:39.116,YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY ALL PROVE THAT SAM KEATING IS THE GENETIC MATCH TO THIS FETUS.
00:27:39.116,00:27:42.702,WHICH STILL DOESN'T PROVE HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER.
00:27:45.331,00:27:47.374,"WHICH IS A MISTAKE, YOUR HONOR."
00:27:47.374,00:27:54.672,"YOU WANT THE CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST YOUR CLIENT, I UNDERSTAND, MS. KEATING, BUT THE EVIDENCE YOU'RE PRESENTING HERE TODAY IN COURT IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL AT BEST."
00:27:54.672,00:28:00.012,THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE AGAINST MR. KEATING IS BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY MS. PARKS.
00:28:00.012,00:28:01.847,"I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT, YOUR HONOR."
00:28:01.847,00:28:03.890,MY HUSBAND'S LAPTOP IS BEING HELD IN POLICE LOCKUP.
00:28:03.890,00:28:09.855,"IT LIKELY CONTAINS HIS CELL COORDINATES, PROVING THAT HE WAS AT KAPPA KAPPA THETA HOUSE THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER."
00:28:09.855,00:28:15.027,MS. PARKS REFUSES TO EXAMINE THE DATA IN FEAR THAT IT WILL COST HER A CONVICTION.
00:28:15.027,00:28:17.655,"DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THIS LAPTOP, MS. PARKS?"
00:28:17.655,00:28:23.536,"WE DO HAVE A LAPTOP, POSSIBLY BELONGING TO SAM KEATING, IN POLICE CUSTODY."
00:28:23.536,00:28:32.378,"IN LIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED TODAY, I'M APPOINTING A FORENSIC EXPERT TO ANALYZE THE PHONE DATA FOUND ON THAT COMPUTER AND PRESENT ITS FINDINGS TO THIS COURT."
00:28:32.378,00:28:34.672,"UNTIL THEN, WE ARE ADJOURNED."
00:28:44.390,00:28:47.226,YOU CALL IT CRAZY.
00:28:56.569,00:29:01.490,"I HAD DINNER WITH MY FIANCé'S MOTHER, THEN HEADED OVER TO ASHER'S."
00:29:01.490,00:29:07.079,"HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING A PARTY, BUT, WELL, NO ONE CAME."
00:29:07.079,00:29:09.707,WHERE'D YOU GO AFTER MR. MILLSTONE'S?
00:29:09.707,00:29:11.875,WES' FOR THE STUDY GROUP.
00:29:15.003,00:29:16.755,WHAT DO YOU WANT?
00:29:16.755,00:29:20.050,"FROM THERE, WE ALL HEADED OVER TO THE BONFIRE."
00:29:20.050,00:29:24.597,"YOU ALL DROVE TOGETHER, IN MR. WALSH'S S.U.V.?"
00:29:24.597,00:29:26.056,THAT'S RIGHT.
00:29:28.267,00:29:34.523,A WITNESS TOLD US THAT HE SAW MR. WALSH'S CAR PARKED OUTSIDE THE KEATING HOUSE THAT NIGHT.
00:29:34.523,00:29:35.899,Asher: IS MICHAELA IN THERE WITH YOU?
00:29:38.527,00:29:40.320,IT'S MY FAULT.
00:29:40.320,00:29:42.448,"YES, BECAUSE WE PARKED THERE."
00:29:56.795,00:29:57.796,Michaela: THEY KNOW.
00:29:57.796,00:29:58.797,Connor: WHO?
00:29:58.797,00:30:00.257,THE POLICE.
00:30:06.513,00:30:08.307,"LOOK, YOU WERE RIGHT."
00:30:08.307,00:30:10.267,"LOOK, EVERYTHING WE DID THAT NIGHT IS DEFENSIBLE."
00:30:10.267,00:30:12.227,REBECCA WENT TO THE HOUSE ALONE.
00:30:12.227,00:30:19.985,"WHEN HE ATTACKED HER, WE WERE SIMPLY DEFENDING HER, AND AFTER, WE WERE SUFFERING FROM PTSD."
00:30:21.361,00:30:23.155,I'VE REINVENTED MYSELF BEFORE.
00:30:23.155,00:30:24.281,I CAN DO IT AGAIN.
00:30:24.281,00:30:25.865,I'LL CHANGE MY NAME.
00:30:25.865,00:30:27.200,I'LL WRITE CRIME FICTION OR BE A HOUSEWIFE.
00:30:27.200,00:30:32.456,"OKAY, NOT A HOUSEWIFE, BUT IF THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW HOW TO BE, IT'S SMART."
00:30:45.218,00:30:48.555,"HEY, LOOK WHO IT IS -- THE HYPOCRITE."
00:30:48.555,00:30:50.349,WHAT?
00:30:50.349,00:30:52.017,YOU'RE REALLY GONNA PLAY DUMB?
00:30:52.017,00:30:56.896,YOU GOT THE NERVE TO TREAT ME LIKE SCUM FOR LYING ABOUT SASHA AFTER WHAT YOU DID?
00:30:56.896,00:31:00.984,"FRANK, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT."
00:31:00.984,00:31:03.069,WOW.
00:31:03.069,00:31:06.281,"KEEPING LYING THAT GOOD, YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY GET AWAY WITH THIS."
00:31:19.085,00:31:20.754,WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
00:31:22.047,00:31:25.050,I CAN'T RIGHT NOW.
00:31:25.050,00:31:28.928,"LISTEN TO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY, OR WE SELL YOU OUT."
00:31:28.928,00:31:30.430,Judge: PLEASE BE SEATED.
00:31:38.355,00:31:43.276,"MR. INGRAM, WERE YOU ABLE TO ACCESS THE GPS DATA ON MR. KEATING'S CELLPHONE?"
00:31:43.276,00:31:45.821,"Ingram: YES. FROM THE LAPTOP, TO WHICH HE BACKED UP HIS PHONE."
00:31:45.821,00:31:52.494,WERE YOU ABLE TO PINPOINT THE LOCATION OF MR. KEATING'S PHONE ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 29th?
00:31:52.494,00:31:54.037,I WAS.
00:31:54.037,00:32:01.545,"AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE MONITOR HERE, I OUTLINED HIS PATH OF TRAVEL IN RED, ALONG WITH THE TIMES HE SPENT AT THE VARIOUS LOCATIONS HE VISITED THAT EVENING."
00:32:01.545,00:32:10.804,"WE BEGIN WITH MR. KEATING HERE, IN NEW HAVEN, AT 7:02 P.M., THEN, IF YOU FOLLOW THE RED LINE, YOU CAN SEE HOW HE TRAVELED ALONG I-95 SOUTH AND CONTINUING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO PHILADELPHIA."
00:32:17.018,00:32:30.824,"WE CAN SEE HE ARRIVED AT A COFFEE SHOP HERE, BUT HE WAS ONLY THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN CONTINUED ON AND WAS TRAVELING ALONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS, UNTIL FINALLY COMING TO A STOP AT 3204 SPRUCE ROAD."
00:32:37.664,00:32:39.999,AND WHAT TIME WAS MR. KEATING THERE?
00:32:39.999,00:32:42.043,FROM 1:10 A.M.
00:32:42.043,00:32:48.216,THE MEDICAL EXAMINER PLACES MISS STANGARD'S TIME OF DEATH BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 12:00 A.M. AND 6:00 A.M.
00:32:50.218,00:33:06.693,"YOUR HONOR, THE RECORD SHOWS THAT MY CLIENT, REBECCA SUTTER, DID NOT IMPREGNATE MISS STANGARD, NOR DID SHE TAKE HER TO AN ABORTION CLINIC WITH HOPES OF TERMINATING SAID PREGNANCY, NOR DID SHE DRIVE THROUGH THREE STATES TO SPEND 20 MINUTES ON A ROOFTOP WHERE MISS STANGARD'S BODY WAS FOUND IN A WATER TANK."
00:33:06.693,00:33:09.863,AND YET MY CLIENT STANDS ACCUSED OF MURDER.
00:33:09.863,00:33:14.701,TO ALLOW THIS TRIAL TO PROCEED WOULD BE A GROSS MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.
00:33:27.005,00:33:31.343,"Reporter: MISS SUTTER, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU DROPPED?"
00:33:31.343,00:33:33.094,GIVE US SOME ROOM.
00:33:33.094,00:33:35.722,DOES SHE INTEND TO DEFEND HER HUSBAND FOR THE MURDER OF LILA STANGARD?
00:33:35.722,00:33:37.182,NO COMMENT.
00:33:37.182,00:33:39.977,IS IT TRUE SAM WAS THE FATHER OF LILA'S UNBORN CHILD?
00:33:41.645,00:33:45.398,HER HUSBAND WAS JUST NAMED THE PRIME SUSPECT IN THE LILA STANGARD MURDER.
00:33:56.869,00:33:58.453,Woman: SHE'S NOT LIKE YOU OR ME.
00:33:58.453,00:34:01.289,Woman #2: YOU'RE DEFENDING THE WOMAN WHO JUST SOLD OUT HER HUSBAND TO WIN A CASE?
00:34:01.289,00:34:02.708,"GOD, NO."
00:34:02.708,00:34:05.794,I'M JUST SAYING SHE'S NOT A PERSON LIKE THE REST OF US ARE PEOPLE.
00:34:05.794,00:34:07.295,"WHAT IS SHE, THEN?"
00:34:07.295,00:34:09.130,NOT EVEN AN ANIMAL'S THAT HEARTLESS.
00:34:38.785,00:34:41.621,"IT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO, EITHER, BUT WE HAVE TO."
00:34:41.621,00:34:44.332,WE HAVE TO TURN OURSELVES IN AND PUT THIS ON THEM.
00:34:44.332,00:34:46.167,WE CAN GO TO THE POLICE TONIGHT.
00:34:46.167,00:34:48.127,WE JUST PROVED SAM'S THE MURDERER.
00:34:48.127,00:34:49.755,WE'RE IN THE CLEAR.
00:34:49.755,00:34:53.050,"NO, THAT ONLY MEANS THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE MORE HELL-BENT ON FINDING HIM."
00:34:53.050,00:34:55.510,"THE FACT THAT HE'S A MURDERER HELPS US, LAUREL."
00:34:55.510,00:34:59.097,THEY'LL BE MORE LENIENT WITH US IF WE TURN OURSELVES IN.
00:34:59.097,00:35:01.140,PLEASE.
00:35:01.140,00:35:03.769,"LAUREL, WE DIDN'T DO THIS."
00:35:14.029,00:35:16.197,OKAY.
00:35:16.197,00:35:17.908,I'M IN.
00:35:35.008,00:35:36.635,WHAT'S FUNNY?
00:35:36.635,00:35:40.138,IT'S MY BRIDAL BOUTIQUE.
00:35:40.138,00:35:42.390,THEY WANT TO CONFIRM A DRESS FITTING.
00:35:44.601,00:35:52.943,"LOOK -- LOOK, IF AIDEN DOESN'T WANT TO MARRY YOU, IT JUST MEANS THERE'S SOMEONE BETTER AROUND THE CORNER."
00:36:00.700,00:36:01.952,YOU'RE QUIET.
00:36:03.578,00:36:06.289,NOT IN THE MOOD TO CONFESS TO MURDER?
00:36:07.248,00:36:09.167,I'M FINE.
00:36:11.962,00:36:13.797,WHAT?
00:36:16.174,00:36:17.676,WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?
00:36:18.969,00:36:20.846,TOLD YOU SHE KNEW.
00:36:20.846,00:36:22.139,BUT HOW COULD SHE KNOW WE WERE COMING HERE RIGHT NOW?
00:36:26.768,00:36:28.061,I HAD TO.
00:36:28.061,00:36:29.813,FRANK CAME TO ME.
00:36:29.813,00:36:34.943,"HE KNOWS EVERYTHING, WHICH MEANS ANNALISE KNOWS, BECAUSE YOU TOLD HER, RIGHT?"
00:36:34.943,00:36:36.028,NO.
00:36:36.028,00:36:37.154,STOP LYING.
00:36:37.154,00:36:38.738,I'M NOT LYING.
00:36:38.738,00:36:40.657,CONNOR AND MICHAELA ARE GONNA CONFESS.
00:36:40.657,00:36:47.789,"THEY'RE GONNA CONFESS AND PIN IT ON YOU AND REBECCA, SO, PLEASE, TELL ME THE TRUTH."
00:36:47.789,00:36:54.379,"THEY'RE SCARED AND PARANOID, AND I DON'T BLAME THEM, BUT THEY WON'T LISTEN TO ME."
00:36:54.379,00:36:57.007,THEY'LL -- THEY'LL ONLY LISTEN TO YOU.
00:36:57.007,00:36:58.508,PLEASE.
00:37:04.472,00:37:08.185,I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.
00:37:08.185,00:37:12.189,"I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM."
00:37:17.402,00:37:19.654,SCREW THIS.
00:37:19.654,00:37:21.573,MR. WALSH.
00:37:28.663,00:37:33.752,"BUT I CAN GIVE YOU A MILLION REASONS WHY THIS PLAN WON'T GO YOUR WAY, OR YOU CAN JUST TRUST ME."
00:37:37.589,00:37:40.258,"LISTEN, YOU'RE SCARED."
00:37:40.258,00:37:41.509,I KNOW.
00:37:41.509,00:37:44.429,I UNDERSTAND.
00:37:56.441,00:38:00.153,"IF I DID, I WOULD HAVE TURNED YOU IN THE NIGHT THAT IT HAPPENED."
00:38:05.700,00:38:07.702,LET ME HELP YOU.
00:38:09.204,00:38:10.789,LET ME HELP YOU.
00:38:10.789,00:38:17.254,"BECAUSE IF YOU DO, I PROMISE YOU WILL GET AWAY WITH THIS."
00:38:28.765,00:38:32.518,TODAY'S EXAM WILL BE AN ANALYTICAL ESSAY.
00:38:32.518,00:38:42.445,"YOU WILL HEAR A FACT PATTERN OF A CRIMINAL CASE STUDY AND DETERMINE THE POSSIBLE DEFENSES, AFFIRMATIVE AND OTHERWISE, FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED."
00:38:42.445,00:38:44.322,THE CASE IS AS FOLLOWS.
00:38:44.322,00:38:47.533,FOUR INDIVIDUALS WALK INTO A CONVENIENCE STORE.
00:38:47.533,00:38:53.706,"ONE OF THEM, MR. GREEN, DECIDES TO ROB THE CLERK."
00:38:53.706,00:38:55.500,THE CLERK FIGHTS BACK.
00:38:55.500,00:39:02.674,"THE OTHERS, MR. WHITE, MISS BLUE, AND MISS RED, COME TO MR. GREEN'S DEFENSE."
00:39:02.674,00:39:07.595,A PHYSICAL STRUGGLE ENSUES INVOLVING THE INDIVIDUALS AGAINST THE CLERK.
00:39:07.595,00:39:10.265,THE CLERK BECOMES INCAPACITATED.
00:39:10.265,00:39:13.185,SOMEONE HAS SLIMMED DOWN A BIT SINCE LAST TIME.
00:39:14.435,00:39:15.687,SCHOOL STRESS?
00:39:17.105,00:39:19.482,EXAMS.
00:39:19.482,00:39:21.151,BANG!
00:39:21.151,00:39:24.696,"MR. WHITE SHOOTS THE CLERK, KILLING HIM."
00:39:27.199,00:39:29.075,"UH, OKAY, SO I KNOW IT'S CHEESY."
00:39:49.054,00:39:57.436,"NOW, THOUGH MR. WHITE ACTED ALONE IN KILLING THE CLERK, ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS ARE INVOLVED IN THE DISPOSAL OF THE BODY."
00:40:01.191,00:40:04.277,WOW.
00:40:04.277,00:40:06.696,I'VE BEEN BURIED IN WORK.
00:40:08.240,00:40:09.366,I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE I BLEW YOU OFF.
00:40:09.366,00:40:10.783,"WHOA, IT SEEMS?"
00:40:10.783,00:40:13.370,I'M SORRY.
00:40:13.370,00:40:15.705,I JUST...
00:40:16.998,00:40:18.333,CAN WE TALK?
00:40:18.333,00:40:21.419,I DON'T WANT US TO BE OVER.
00:40:23.963,00:40:30.053,"Annalise: NOW, THE GOAL IS TO GET THESE INDIVIDUALS ACQUITTED OF ALL CHARGES, AND THERE IS A WAY."
00:40:30.053,00:40:31.637,FIND IT.
00:40:31.637,00:40:33.848,YOU HAVE 90 MINUTES.
00:40:33.848,00:40:40.230,"Terrence: IT'S GOT TO BE A LITTLE AWKWARD, LEARNING THAT PROFESSOR KEATING'S HUSBAND IS A PRIME SUSPECT IN THE CASE THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON."
00:40:40.230,00:40:41.940,OF COURSE.
00:40:41.940,00:40:46.152,"BUT, HONESTLY, IT'S PROFESSOR KEATING THAT I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT."
00:40:47.987,00:40:51.783,I JUST -- I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW SHE MUST FEEL RIGHT NOW.
00:40:51.783,00:40:56.204,"FROM OUR LIMITED TIME WITH HER, SHE STRIKES ME AS A PRETTY TOUGH CUSTOMER."
00:40:56.204,00:40:58.873,OR SHE PRETENDS TO BE.
00:41:13.430,00:41:20.186,I JUST HOPE THAT HE'S MAN ENOUGH TO COME BACK AND FACE WHAT HE'S DONE.
00:41:52.802,00:41:54.304,WHAT IS IT?
00:41:54.304,00:41:55.847,CONNOR: I think we have a problem.
00:42:00.101,00:42:05.357,"DETECTIVE, I'M HANNAH KEATING, SAM KEATING'S SISTER."
00:42:05.357,00:42:07.317,LET ME BE CLEAR.
00:42:07.317,00:42:11.029,"WHATEVER HIS WIFE TOLD YOU, MY BROTHER IS NO MURDERER."
00:42:12.571,00:42:15.533,YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW'S IN TOWN.
