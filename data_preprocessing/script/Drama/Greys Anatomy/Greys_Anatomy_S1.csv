"If Tomorrow Never Comes"
"(Sunrise)"
""
"MVO: A couple hundred years ago, Benjamin Franklin shared with the world the secret of his success. ""Never leave that till tomorrow,"" he said, ""which you can do today."""
""
"(Meredith lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. It is storming outside and her alarm starts buzzing.)"
""
"MVO: This is the man who discovered electricity. You'd think more of us would listen to what he had to say."
""
"(George walking through the hall towards Meredith's room with two cups of coffee. Izzie comes out into the hall. George spills the coffee on himself.)"
""
"MVO: I don't know why we put things off, but if I had to guess, I'd say it has a lot to do with fear. Fear of failure, fear of pain, fear of rejection."
""
"Izzie: Wouldn't it be easier to just ask her out?"
""
"(George walks away and Meredith hits snooze again.)"
""
"George: She's gonna be late."
""
"Izzie: Maybe not."
""
"George: We should wait for her."
""
"Izzie: Definitely not. I'm not her mother, and you are not her boyfriend. Not yet, anyway."
""
"George: Stop, ok? I told you I'm not interested."
""
"Izzie: Life is short, George. Do you really want to die before you ever ask her out?"
""
"George: I do not want to ask her out."
""
"Izzie: Do you really want to die a liar?"
""
"George: I'm not...I'm not dying."
""
"MVO: Sometimes, the fear is just of making a decision."
""
""
"(Scene: SGH parking lot, Meredith is rushing)"
""
"MVO: Because, what if you're wrong? What if you're making a mistake you can't undo?"
""
"(Derek arrives and parks next to Meredith)"
""
"Meredith: Crap."
""
"Derek: Crap?"
""
"Meredith: Hi. I'm late."
""
"Derek: You're avoiding me."
""
"Meredith: Yes, but also late."
""
"Derek: Ok, are we going to talk about this?"
""
"Meredith: No."
""
"Derek: About us and Bailey and what she saw?"
""
"Meredith: I don't need to talk about it. I experienced it, naked."
""
"Derek: This is getting complicated."
""
"Meredith: Complicated for me. I'm the intern sleeping with the attending. Bailey isn't speaking to me anymore."
""
"Derek: Not that that's a bad thing. If I was a better guy, I'd walk away."
""
"Meredith: Yes, you would."
""
"Derek: Do you want me to be a better guy?"
""
"Meredith: Yes."
""
"(They enter hospital. He pushes elevator button.)"
""
"Meredith: No. Crap. I'm late."
""
"(Meredith walks away.)"
""
"Derek: Take your time. Think about it."
""
""
"(Cristina putting pants on. Her and Burke obviously just finished having sex in a lab room.)"
""
"Cristina: That was definitely worth being late."
""
"Burke: (Sighs) Thanks. Is this a...? Should we talk about this?"
""
"Cristina: Yeah, definitely."
""
"(Cristina leaves then enters the locker rooms. Meredith is inside.)"
""
"Meredith: You're late."
""
"Cristina: So are you."
""
"Meredith: I know, and I can't afford to piss off Bailey any more. Do you think she told anyone?"
""
"Cristina: About you and McDreamy?"
""
"Meredith: Yeah."
""
"Cristina: No, he's her boss too."
""
"Meredith: If they find out, what can they...? Can they kick me out, or...?"
""
"Cristina: No... Not officially. You'll just get edged out, blacklisted, banned from his surgeries, passed over for chief resident. (Sighs) It'll be humiliating, but you'll live."
""
"Meredith: I have to end it. I definitely have to end it. I have to end it, right?"
""
"Cristina: Meredith, shut up."
""
"Meredith: What?"
""
""
"(Meredith and Cristina are rushing upstairs and through hallway.)"
""
"Meredith: Did you seriously just tell me to shut up?"
""
"Cristina: Oh, please. You got a hot doctor who like to make you open up, and say ""ahh."" It's the American dream, stop whining about it."
""
"Meredith: No. No good can come from sleeping with your boss."
""
"Bailey: Cristina, you're late."
""
"Cristina: So is Meredith."
""
"MVO: Whatever it is we're afraid of, one thing holds true. That, by the time the pain of not doing a thing gets worse than the fear of doing it, it can feel like we're carrying around a giant tumor."
""
"Bailey: When we walk in this door, you will maintain decorum. You will not laugh, vomit, or drop you jaw. Are we understood?"
""
""
"(All open door and enter room 2111)"
""
"Izzie: Why would we laugh?"
""
"Alex: Oh, just you wait."
""
"Bailey: Good morning, Miss Connors."
""
"Miss Connors: Good Morning."
""
"(Woman is lying in bed with an extremely large tumor.)"
""
"George: What is it?"
""
"Cristina: Tumor."
""
"MVO: And you thought I was speaking metaphorically."
""
"(Annie Connor's room)"
""
"Alex: Good morning, Annie. How are you? This is Dr. Bailey and these are my fellow interns."
""
"Bailey: Dr. Karev, we refer to patients as ""mister""..."
""
"Annie: I told him to call me ""Annie."" ""Miss Connors"" makes me feel old and fat, which I am, but why feel that way?"
""
"(Burke enters)"
""
"Burke: Good morning."
""
"Alex: Annie, this is Dr. Burke (Whispers) Awesome surgeon."
""
"Bailey: Dr. Karev."
""
"Alex: Annie Connors is a 43-year-old woman who presented last night with progressive shortness of breath for the past three months. Found to have a very large tumor of unknown origin pressed against her diaphragm. Stable vital signs. Scheduled for CT this morning, sir."
""
"Burke: Thank you, Dr. Karev. (To Annie) Are you at all claustrophobic?"
""
"Annie: I've been housebound for the last year. How claustrophobic could I be?"
""
"Burke: All right then. Dr. Stevens is going to take you up for a CT. It'll give us a better look at the tumor, and we'll know how to proceed."
""
"Annie: Could someone tell my mom? She'll worry if she gets back and I'm not here."
""
"Burke: Yeah, of course. Of course."
""
"Annie: And would it be possible for Alex to take me instead? I mean, he...He's just so fun to look at."
""
"Alex: (Laughing) Annie."
""
"Burke: Sure. Sure, Ms. Connors. Excuse me."
""
""
"(Leave Ms. Connor's room)"
""
"Izzie: How much do you think it weighs?"
""
"George: 60 pounds."
""
"Izzie: More. She's carrying a whole extra person."
""
"Cristina: This one's going in the books. I've got to get in."
""
"Izzie: I almost did. Have you ever seen Alex like that? He actually seemed sincere."
""
"Meredith: ""Seemed"" being the operative word."
""
"Alex: He was on call last night when she came in. I am never leaving this place again."
""
"Bailey: Let's move, people. Ms. Connor's surgery, should we choose to proceed, will take most, if not all, of the surgeons off the floor, which means you people will have to work extra hard not to kill anyone, ?cause we won't be there to fix your mistakes."
""
"Cristina: I really want in on this."
""
"Burke: I thought we weren't talking."
""
"Cristina: I'm not talking. I'm just saying."
""
"Burke: Find her mother, get a family history, and I'll tell Bailey."
""
""
"(Another room)"
""
"Izzie: Mr. Harper had a coronary bypass yesterday. His blood pressure, currently 100/65. It was running low overnight down to 70/30, but responded to medication. Postoperative labs show a crit of 30 and normal coagulation. Chest-tube output has halted over the last two hours."
""
"Bailey: What's you plan?"
""
"Izzie: Chest x-ray and check the tube for possible occlusion."
""
"Bailey: Good. (To wife) He's doing fine."
""
"Mrs. Harper: Thank you."
""
""
"(Walking down stairs in SGH)"
""
"George: I know you think I like Meredith but I don't like Meredith."
""
"Izzie: What?"
""
"George: No. I like Meredith. Obviously, I like Meredith. I just...I don't have a thing for her."
""
"Izzie: Ok."
""
"George: It's just this morning...I know you were probably just teasing, But I don't want you to say anything like that to her. Because you know, we live together, and that'd be awkward."
""
"Izzie: George, stop talking."
""
"George: Ok, then."
""
""
"(Hospital room where a man is trying to walk but is having difficulty.)"
""
"Bailey: Morning."
""
"Derek: Mr. Levangie, this is Dr. Bailey and her fine staff of surgical interns."
""
"(Derek, Meredith and Bailey all exchange glances.)"
""
"Mr. Levangie: Welcome to hell, kids."
""
"Bailey: Who's presenting?"
""
"George: Edward Levangie is a 63-year-old man admitted for pain management for Dyskinesia. He's been stable since last night, and responding to the bolus injections."
""
"Bailey: Izzie, possible treatments?"
""
"Izzie: For Parkinson's disease? Um, deep brain stimulation has shown..."
""
"Derek: Not for Parkinson's, for spinal pain."
""
"Izzie: Oh, um..."
""
"Meredith: Intraspinal catheter. That way, he can have constant pain medication."
""
"Derek: Excellent. This is Dr. Grey. She's gonna prep you for the procedure and assist."
""
"Derek: (Pager beeps) Excuse me."
""
"Bailey: You make yourselves busy, I'll catch up with you."
""
""
"(Bailey follows Derek out. They are in elevator alone.)"
""
"Derek: Miranda."
""
"Bailey: Excuse me?"
""
"Derek: Well, that's your name, right? It's on your jacket. (She looks smug) All right, fine. I'll just call you Bailey then."
""
"Bailey: You think you're charming in that talented, neurotic, overly moussed hair sort of way, good for you. But if you think I'm going to stand back and watch while you favor her..."
""
"Derek: I don't favor her. She's good."
""
"Bailey: I'm sure she is."
""
"(Elevator opens and Bailey gets out)"
""
"Derek: You know, can I point out that, technically, I'm your boss?"
""
"Bailey: You don't scare me. Look, I'm not going to advertise your extracurricular activities with my intern. However, the next time I see you favoring Meredith Grey in any way, I'll make sure she doesn't see the inside of on OR for a month. Just for the sake of balance."
""
"(Bailey walks away and elevator closes with Derek inside.)"
""
""
"(Alex is getting Annie ready for her CT.)"
""
"CT Tech: We're all set, doc."
""
"Alex: Ok. (To Annie) There's going to be a microphone in there for you in case you get scared or you want to get out, but, um you know, try not to do that, because then we're going to have to start all over again."
""
"Annie: I'm fine. I'll be fine."
""
"Alex: I know you're going to be fine, because I'm going to be right over there behind that glass, waiting for you. All right?"
""
"Annie: Ok."
""
"Alex: You ready? Are you really ready? Let's do this. (Pushes button) See ya."
""
"(Alex goes into the operator room, his pager makes a noise, he slaps it.)"
""
"Alex: Oh, hey, man, you got an extra battery?"
""
"CT Tech: Unbelievable."
""
"Alex: Oh, I know, right."
""
"CT Tech: I've never seen anything like this. God."
""
"Alex: Well, what I don't understand...is how a person lets it get like that. (Annie can hear Alex speaking) I mean, man, that is a whole lot of nasty."
""
"CT Tech: Maybe she's afraid of doctors. Poor thing."
""
"Alex: Poor thing? Please. If you're afraid of doctors, you take a pill. She's just sick, like, warped, you know? Seriously, I don't know how she lives with herself."
""
""
"(Cristina talking to Mrs. Connors in the hospital lobby.)"
""
"Mrs. Connors: Well, at first, we thought she was just putting on weight. When we realized what was happening, I tried to get her to go to the doctor, but she was scared. And, the bigger it got, the less she wanted to go. And she never really felt all that sick until last night. She couldn't breathe."
""
"Cristina: Because the tumor was crushing her lungs."
""
"Mrs. Connors: Yes, well, I called 911. It just seemed like the right thing to do."
""
"Cristina: You know, the right thing to do would have been to call a year ago. Thank you."
""
""
"(Mr. Levangie's room)"
""
"Meredith: Ok, Mr. Levangie. We're going to get you more comfortable, ok? I'm going to go downstairs and I'll be back up shortly."
""
"Mr. Levangie: Ok"
""
"Meredith: Ok."
""
"(Meredith leaves; daughter follows her into the hall)"
""
"Ms. Levangie: Excuse me. I'm sorry, doctor..."
""
"Meredith: Grey."
""
"Ms. Levangie: My dad seems to like you. He's always liked skinny blondes. Is that rude? I'm sorry. I'm so tired."
""
"Meredith: Is there something...?"
""
"Ms. Levangie: I was wondering if you would talk to him."
""
"Meredith: About?"
""
"Ms. Levangie: Brain surgery. The doctor mentioned it, and I've read about it online. If it worked, it could help with most of his symptoms, not just his pain."
""
"Meredith: Is he a candidate? I don't..."
""
"Ms. Levangie: He is, but he's afraid of it. Surgery on his back, he can understand, but his brain...And there are risks. But his quality of life..."
""
"Meredith: There isn't any."
""
"Ms. Levangie: And, it keeps getting worse. I'm getting married next month. I already lost my mom. And I want him to walk...I want him with me. Maybe that's selfish, but...you don't know what it's like having a parent...Watching him..."
""
"Meredith: I do. I do know what it's like. I'll see what I can do."
""
"Ms. Levangie: Thanks"
""
"Meredith: You're welcome."
""
"Ms. Levangie: Thank you."
""
""
"(Meredith walks away. Bailey, Derek and Burke are examining x-rays from Annie Connors.)"
""
"Burke: The right hemidiaphragm is so high that it's completely displacing her lung tissue."
""
"Derek: It's infiltrated her spinal canal in three places. We should start there. It's going to take 3 or 4 hours to get around those nerves."
""
"Burke: I'd prefer to start in front, and then flip her. You never know what kind of vessels are involved, how intertwined they are. I'm going to need a good head start."
""
"Derek: I should really go with the spine fresh, if I miss a step, she's paralyzed."
""
"Burke: If I don't relieve the pressure on her lungs, she'll be dead. So, she won't mind if she can't walk."
""
"Bailey: Do you think she really wants to live? Come on. She's been housebound. She's been living under this thing, just watching it grow for how long? She doesn't seem stupid. Doesn't even seem all that scared. Why would anyone wait this long unless they wanted to die?"
""
"Derek: People do things every day that they know could kill them. Doesn't mean they want to die."
""
"Bailey: What are her chances of surviving the surgery?"
""
"Burke: Slightly better than if we do nothing."
""
"Bailey: So is it worth it? (Burke looks at her, Derek sighs) Hey, come on. You were already thinking it, I'm just saying."
""
"Burke: She's 43. It's worth a try."
""
"(Burke leaves)"
""
"Derek: Ha! Morning."
""
"(Derek and Bailey leave, Meredith is waiting in the hall.)"
""
"Meredith: Dr. Shepherd. Mr. Levangie, the Parkinson's patient, is he a good candidate for DBS?"
""
"Derek: Yes, but he's not interested."
""
"Meredith: Ok, but I think it's worth talking to him again, pushing him."
""
"Derek: We're talking about a brain surgery that is performed while the patient is wide awake, a risk of paralysis, a risk of death. And, the patient doesn't want it. It is not my job to push him into anything and it's definitely not yours."
""
"Meredith: Ok."
""
"Derek: Since you clearly uncomfortable with my decision in this case, it's probably best you don't scrub in."
""
"Meredith: But..."
""
"Derek: It's a minor procedure. You won't be missed."
""
"(Meredith walks away)"
""
"Derek: (To Bailey) You know, they call you the Nazi."
""
"Bailey: So I've heard."
""
"(Derek and Bailey walk away in opposite directions.)"
""
""
"(Annie Connors room, Burke and Alex are there. Mrs. Connors is making the bed. )"
""
"Burke: I won't lie to you. The surgery is going to be long and difficult, but we have an extremely capable surgical team, and I can..."
""
"Annie: Am I going to die?"
""
"Burke: There's always that risk but if we don't do the surgery..."
""
"Annie: I'll definitely die."
""
"Burke: Yes."
""
"Annie: Soon?"
""
"Burke: Yes."
""
"Annie: Mom, the room's clean."
""
"Mrs. Connors: Ok, honey, ok."
""
"Annie: Mom!"
""
"Mrs. Connors: She'll have the surgery."
""
"Annie: Mom!"
""
"Mrs. Connors: No. No, Annie. She will have the surgery."
""
"Annie: I guess I'll have the surgery."
""
"Burke: I think that is a very wise decision."
""
"Annie: On one condition. I don't want him there. (Points at Alex)"
""
"Alex: I'm sorry, Annie. Did I upset you in some way?"
""
"Annie: If he's in the surgery, I'm not having it. (Pause while Burke and Alex look at her and each other) That's how I live with myself."
""
"Burke: Ok, Miss Connors. (Turns to leave) Dr. Karev."
""
"(Annie and her mom hold hands)"
""
""
"(Burke and Karev walk through hallway)"
""
"Burke: What the hell did you do?"
""
"Alex: Nothing. I-I don't know. Man. The mike must have been on. I was talking to the tech guy..."
""
"Burke: If anything goes wrong, anything, you are 60 percent more likely to be sued if you've offended the patient. 60%."
""
"Alex: I never would have said that stuff. The mike shouldn't have been on. I didn't realize she could hear me."
""
"Burke: Well, now you won't realize you chance to scrub in. You're banned from the OR. Mine or anyone else's. All week."
""
"(Cristina walks up)"
""
"Cristina: I got the history on the tumor. It's been growing for a year and a half. A year and a half and it's the first time she's even had it looked at. It's like she's fatally lazy."
""
"(Burke walks away, shaking his head)"
""
"Alex: Why doesn't she get banned?"
""
"(Burke grabs George who is walking by)"
""
"Burke: Go prep Annie Connors for surgery. You're scrubbing in with Cristina."
""
"George: Really? I mean, thank you. Ok."
""
""
"(George is in Annie Connor's room, prepping her for surgery)"
""
"George: We just need to recheck your labs and get an EKG, so I just need to take a little blood. Dr. Burke is great, and Dr. Bailey. I know you're probably scared."
""
"Annie: That's ok, kitten. You can just do your job. You don't have to talk to the fat, nasty tumor lady. I mean, I let it get this bad. How much sympathy do I deserve?"
""
"George: Why did you let it get this bad?"
""
"Annie: You're the first person since I got here to ask me that."
""
"George: Well, I guess it's just like the elephant in the room."
""
"Annie: Elephant?"
""
"George: I mean..."
""
"Annie: It's more like a giant sow, don't you think? (They smile at each other) Every time I went to the hospital, someone died. All four of my grandparents, then my dad. My best friend's mom, my baby sister. They all went in, never came out. So I put it off."
""
"George: You know, you're not the only one to put things off. I mean I never do anything till the last possible minute."
""
"Annie: Like what?"
""
"George: Well...I've had this thing for my roommate since, like, day one, and I just...I can't tell her. She probably wouldn't go out with me, anyway, but...How do I know that for sure, if I don't ever ask?"
""
"Annie: Seriously? You're equating your pathetic love life with my record-breaking tumor? Seriously?"
""
""
"(Outdoor lunch tables)"
""
"Meredith: It's just that he blatantly favors me in front of her and then blatantly dismisses me."
""
"Cristina: How do you know he was favoring you? Look, you've got a brain. You got into this program. Just because Shepherd wants to munch your cookies doesn't mean you didn't deserve what you worked for."
""
"Meredith: But he's making me look bad. I have to end it."
""
"Cristina: Right."
""
"Meredith: It's over."
""
"Cristina: Uh, huh."
""
"Alex: Is it true you get to scrub in on that tumor?"
""
"Cristina: Don't sit here."
""
"Izzie: You get to scrub in? How psyched are you?"
""
"Cristina: On a scale of one to ecstatic, ecstatic."
""
"Alex: It's unbelievable. You know what I think? I think Burke wants to get into your scrubs."
""
"Cristina: Why are you sitting here?"
""
"Alex: He kicked me off that surgery for the same crap you pull every day."
""
"Cristina: You know what. If I stuck this fork into his thigh, would I get in trouble?"
""
"Meredith: Not if you make it look like an accident."
""
"George: Hey!"
""
"Izzie: Hi."
""
"Alex: Thank God, man. I'm drowning in estrogen here."
""
"George: (To Meredith) You look...is everything ok?"
""
"Meredith: Shepherd's a jackass."
""
"Izzie: Really? I think he's kind of great."
""
"Cristina: He reamed her out in front of Bailey."
""
"Izzie: Why?"
""
"Meredith: Cause he's a jackass."
""
"George: Oh. (Throws his tray) Well, bad days are...bad. Maybe tonight, uh, if, you know, if you drink alcohol, I mean, we could all of us, I mean, go out and drink alcohol...because of the bad day."
""
"Meredith: (Pager beeps) I got to go."
""
"Alex: Dude."
""
"George: Shut up."
""
"(Cristina and Alex laugh at George, Izzie pats his shoulder)"
""
""
"(Mr. Levangie's room)"
""
"Derek: How's your back?"
""
"Mr. Levangie: Still good."
""
"Derek: Good. (To daughter) How are you? Good? (To Mr. Levangie) Can you lean forward for me? I just want to check something. Does that feel ok?"
""
"Mr. Levangie: Yeah."
""
"Derek: Right here?"
""
"(Meredith enters)"
""
"Meredith: Did you page?"
""
"Derek: Mr. Levangie, have you given any more thought about the other surgical options we discussed this morning?"
""
"Mr. Levangie: What? Why would I? I already told you no. I'm letting you cut into my back, but that's not enough for you. All you guys ever want to do is cut."
""
"Ms. Levangie: Dad, just listen to what he has to say."
""
"Mr. Levangie: I already listened."
""
"Derek: Sir, there's a very small window of opportunity here. You know, once the Parkinson's progresses to a point of dementia, there's, you know, you're no longer a candidate for DBS."
""
"Mr. Levangie: and when I'm no longer a candidate, is that when you people will leave me the hell alone! What? Do I have to start drooling, and forget my name to get a little peace and quiet?"
""
"Derek: All right. I'll check back with you later. Try to get some rest."
""
"(Derek walks away, Meredith lingers in the hall.)"
""
"Ms. Levangie: Dad, you're being unreasonable. The doctors are only trying to help you."
""
"Mr. Levangie: It's my damn life, and it's my damn brain. You want me to let them cut up my brain while I'm lying her awake, for what?"
""
"Ms. Levangie: Dad!"
""
"Mr. Levangie: I'll be at your wedding. I will sit in the back. Your uncle will walk you down the aisle. I know it's not perfect, but it's life. Life is messy sometimes."
""
"Ms. Levangie: I know that."
""
"(Daughter leaves)"
""
"Mr. Levangie: (To Meredith) If she knows, then what the hell are we still talking for, huh? Why in hell can't she drop it?"
""
"Meredith: It is your life. But it's her life too. And you have a chance to get better here. And all she's asking you to do is try."
""
"(Meredith leaves)"
""
""
"(Burke, George and Cristina are scrubbing in for Annie Connors' surgery.)"
""
"Cristina: If they pull this off, I'm totally calling Oprah."
""
"(Bailey enters)"
""
"Bailey: You two been working out?"
""
"George: Um, sometime I jog, and I try to take the stairs whenever possible."
""
"(Derek enters)"
""
"Cristina: Why?"
""
"Bailey: See that large pile of tumor? You're going to be retracting it for the next 14 hours, so I'm just saying I hope you have strong backs."
""
"(Meredith enters)"
""
"Meredith: Dr. Shepherd."
""
"Derek: Yes?"
""
"Meredith: Mr. Levangie has agreed to DBS. If we do it today. If he leaves, he won't come back."
""
"Burke: Don't worry, Dr. Shepherd. It'll take hours before we get around to the spine. I'll page you."
""
"Derek: All right, then. (Leaving) Let's do it."
""
""
"(Meredith and Bailey are alone in the scrub room)"
""
"Meredith: Dr. Bailey. I didn't know...that he was my boss, when I met him. I didn't know."
""
"Bailey: I don't care."
""
"Meredith: Really? Oh, well, you sort of seemed to not be talking to me, so I ..."
""
"Bailey: You see this, what's happening right here? This is the problem with you sleeping with my boss. Not whether or not you know him before, but how it affects my day. And me standing here talking to you about your sex life affects my day. And the longer this little fling goes on, the more favors you get over the others, who are fighting tooth and nail just to make it through this program without any assistance. When those people start finding out what's going on and they don't want to work with you and talk to you or look at you, and they start bitching and moaning at me, the more it affects my day. So, no, Dr. Grey, I don't care what you know, or when you know it. Are we understood?"
""
"Meredith: Yes."
""
"Bailey: Good."
""
"(Meredith leaves and Bailey continues scrubbing in)"
""
""
"(Hallway of SGH)"
""
"Alex: This sucks."
""
"Izzie: Yeah well, I'm not a real fan of yours, either."
""
"Alex: Not you. This. Everyone is scrubbed in somewhere."
""
"Izzie: Bright side, we have the run of the floor."
""
"Alex: Great! Want to do it in the stairwell? I'm just saying you never know what could happen."
""
"(Patient in bed in hallway barfs on Alex)"
""
"Alex: I'm changing."
""
"Izzie: I'll page you if I need you."

"(Cristina looks a little stunned and bewildered. She looks at Mrs. Lu and then back at Izzie)"
""
"CRISTINA: No."
""
"IZZIE: Why not?"

"CRISTINA: It’s like that old saying you should see the other guy."
""
"DR. BAILEY (calls out): Why are we not attempting to re-attach the severed penis?"
""
"CRISTINA: Penis’ don’t slice. They tear. You can only re-attach with a clean cut. If she wanted to slice him off with a knife …"

"ALEX: So go get one. I was here first."
"MEREDITH: I am not backing down so I can do sutures all day while you’re up in the O.R. This is a surgical case, and you know it."

"GEORGE: Oh, uh, no sir."

"RICHARD: Oh, a buddy of mine in forty-four, fifty one, Lloyd Mackie? Give him whatever he needs."

"GEORGE: Yes sir."

"(George leaves the room)"

"(Cut to a patient room where Lloyd Mackie a middle aged black man lights up a cigarette)"
""
"GEORGE (shocked): Mr Mackie! No smoking! There’s no smoking"
""
"LLOYD: Why not?"
""
"GEORGE: Oh my god! (He grabs the cigarette from him) You’re in a hospital."
""
"LLYOD: Your point being?"
""
"(George rushes into the adjacent bathroom)"
""
"GEORGE: I don’t know if you’ve listened to the surgeon-general lately, say in the past twenty years, but smoking is bad. Smoking will kill you."
""
"(He flushes the cigarette down the toilet and turns back to Lloyd)"
""
"LLYOD:  Liver cancer will kill me. Smoking will just speed up the process."
""
"GEORGE: You’re at the top of the donor list for a new liver. There’s hope."
""
"LLOYD: Sweetheart, I’ve been at the top of the list for … eight months. I’m not in the batter’s cage. I’m in a dugout, about to be traded."
"GEORGE: You like baseball?"
""
"LLOYD: No."
""
"GEORGE: Oh. Um, well, um, the chief wanted me to look in on you."

"LLOYD: Hmm. Richard’s a dear old friend. He’s been my doctor for thirty years."

"GEORGE: Well, whatever you need, I’m your man. Just name it."

"LLOYD (gives suggestive George a look): Oh … I’m sure I’ll think of something."

"(Cut back to Izzie and Cristina with their John Doe)"
""
"CRISTINA: There’s no corneal reflexes."
""
"IZZIE: It’s been fifty-five minutes. If he doesn’t respond to these tests in the next five hours, what? We’re supposed to just stand here, and watch him die?"
""
"CRISTINA: If he doesn’t respond to these tests, it’s because he’s already dead."
""
"IZZIE: Technically. Legally."
""
"CRISTINA: Actually, Izzie, actually dead."
""
"IZZIE: He’s breathing, he has a heartbeat."
""
"CRISTINA: Look at his EEG. There’s no higher brain function. He’ll never talk, move or think again. There’s no one in there. Think like a doctor, Izzie."
""
"IZZIE: He could wake up. What about a miracle? There are medical miracles, you know."
""
"(Dr. Shepard is revealed standing at the doorway and he appears to have overheard some of the conversation)"
""
"DR. SHEPARD: I know. You’re right. Miracles happen. (He walks in and checks John Doe himself) People do wake up, that’s why we do a series of tests over a set number of hours, so when we call time of death, we know that we’ve done everything in our power to make sure it’s actually his time of death. But there isn’t going to be any miracles. This is the hard part. To stand around as surgeons and not cut. That’s what ‘do no harm’ means."
""
"(He leaves the room)"
""
"CRISTINA: Wish he’d just go into the light already, so I can get on another case."
"(Izzie looks at Cristina appalled)"
""
"CRISTINA: Oh, I’m the devil because I’d rather be in surgery, instead of standing watch over the death squad? It’s depressing."
""
"(Izzie rifles threw John Doe’s personal items)"
""
"IZZIE: Look at his sneakers. They’re brand new. And somebody sewed this tear in his shirt, and he has one of those electronic key cards. He belongs to someone. An hour ago, he was out there, alive. To simply stand here and wait for him to die…"
""
"CRISTINA: Would be a waste of life."
""
"IZZIE: Exactly."
""
"CRISTINA (suddenly excited): It would be a waste of organs."

""
"VIPER: Ah, you got a nice touch. And by the way, you are a rocking babe."
""
"MEREDITH: Seriously, do you actually think you have a shot here?"
""
"VIPER: I like to think I’ve got a shot anywhere."
""
"MEREDITH: Oh."
""
"VIPER: Mmm."
""
"MEREDITH: Look, you really have to let me take you for some tests; run a CT. You could have internal bleeding."
""
"VIPER: No thank you, I’ve got a race to get back to."
""
"MEREDITH: Why? You can’t win now anyway."
""
"VIPER: Doesn’t mean I can’t cross that finish line. There’s a party at the finish line. (he whispers) Do you want to meet me there?"
""
"MEREDITH: One test. A CT. I’ll have you out of here in an hour."
""
"VIPER: Can’t do it, gotta go."
""
"MEREDITH: Okay, well, you realise that you’re leaving against medical advice and that I strongly urge you to stay."
""
"VIPER: The frat guy said I could go."
""
"MEREDITH: The frat guy is an ass. Okay, well, you have to sign an AMA form."
""
"VIPER: Darlin’, I will do anything you want me to."
""
"(She holds out a clipboard for Viper to sign)"
""
"MEREDITH: What is it with you guys and your need to dirty everything up?"
""
"VIPER: I don’t know. Maybe it’s just testosterone, eh?"
""
"MEREDITH: Maybe. You might want to see a doctor about that, too."
""
"VIPER: Come here. (he takes the form and signs it and puts it on a table) There."
""
"(He gets up and takes a few steps towards the door but turns back abruptly. He grabs Meredith and kisses her who just holds her hands up in protest)"
""
"VIPER: That was for good luck. (he opens the door) Don’t worry, darling, you’ll see me again."
"(He leaves)"
""
"MEREDITH (calls out): For your sake, I hope not!"
""
"(Meredith shakes her head and begins to strip the bed. She looks up and sees Derek standing outside through a window watching her looking shocked. She moves to exit as Derek opens the door)"
""
"MEREDITH (tries not to smile): What do you want?"
""
"DR. SHEPARD: You make out with patients now?"
""
"MEREDITH: What are you jealous?"
""
"DR. SHEPARD: I don’t get jealous."
""
"MEREDITH: We had sex, once."
""
"DR. SHEPARD: And we kissed, in an elevator."
""
"MEREDITH: And we kissed in an elevator, once!"
""
"DR. SHEPARD: No, seriously, I mean come on, go out with me."
""
"MEREDITH: No."
""
"DR. SHEPARD (semi serious): You know, I almost died today. Yeah, I came like (he gestures) this close. How would you feel if I died? And you didn’t get a chance to go out with me?"
""
"MEREDITH: Get over yourself already."
""
"DR. SHEPARD (smiles): Come on."
""
"MEREDITH: It’s the chase, isn’t it?"
""
"DR. SHEPARD: What?"
""
"MEREDITH: The thrill of the chase. I’ve been wondering to myself, why are you so hell bent on getting me to go out with you? You know you’re my boss, you know it’s against the rules, you know I keep saying no. It’s the chase."
""
"DR. SHEPARD: Well, its fun, isn’t it?"
""
"MEREDITH: You see? This is a game to you. But not to me. Because unlike you, I still have something to prove"
"(She leaves the room)"
""
""
"(Cut to an O.R. where Bailey is performing surgery on a patient. Cristina and Izzie enter the O.R)"
""
"DR. BAILEY: I know you see me resecting this bowel. Do I strike you as someone who enjoys multitasking?"
""
"CRISTINA: We have a John Doe. In three hours, we have to declare him brain dead. We want to harvest his organs."
""
"DR. BAILEY: So why you wasting time on this? You know how many patients we have downstairs."
""
"IZZIE: If he dies (to Cristina) and he could still live, you know (back to Bailey) his death should mean something."
""
"DR. BAILEY: And you want a harvest surgery."
""
"CRISTINA: I wanna save lives. (Bailey looks gives her scalding look) Okay, I want a harvest surgery."
""
"DR. BAILEY: Getting organs from a John Doe is a long shot. Without ID, you can’t contact the family, without the family, you can’t get consent to harvest the organs. Let the poor man die in peace."
""
"IZZIE: But if we can find the family –"
""
"DR. BAILEY (interrupts): And get consent."
""
"CRISTINA: We could harvest the organs?"
""
"DR. BAILEY: If you find the family."

"ALEX: What’re you doing?"

"GEORGE: Hiding. There’s this VIP patient, he likes me."
""
"ALEX: Well, that’s good, right?"
""
"GEORGE: He likes me likes me."

"ALEX: Go for it, man, get yours. I’m down with the rainbow. (George looks up, wide-eyed)Oh. Are you not gay?"

"GEORGE: No."

"ALEX: Really? (looks amused) Dude, sorry."

"GEORGE: Do you … do you think … does Meredith think I’m gay?"
""
"CRISTINA: Are you?"
"GEORGE: No."
""
"CRISTINA: Really?"
""
"(George looks frustrated. A nurse comes over to Izzie and Cristina walks back up to her)"
""
"IZZIE: Hey, we found this on our John Doe, It’s a hotel key card? I’ve called the police and they’re going to send someone over and maybe they can figure out what hotel he’s staying at, get his ID from there. Could you…"
""
"NURSE #1: I’ll make sure the police get it."
""
"IZZIE: Okay. It’s just, it’s really important. We only have a few hours before we have to declare him and I’d really like to find his family."
""
"NURSE #1: You want their permission for organ donation?"
""
"(George looks up at this interested)"
""
"IZZIE: I just … really want to find them."
""
"(She leaves. Cristina looks after her, surprised, and then turns to go)"
""
"GEORGE: You have a potential donor? (Cristina turns around and nods) What’s his blood type?"
""
"CRISTINA: Uh, O-neg."
""
"(Cristina walks off and George pulls out a folder)"
""
""
"(Cut to Izzie looking over her John Doe)"
""
"IZZIE: Okay, well, I know you probably can’t hear me, and you’re feeling this big push to go towards the light, where everything is all haloes and all-you-can-eat buffets and stuff. And I mean, sharing your organs is really great and all, but I think you have a family. I can feel it. So I think it’d be really great if you could do me a favour, and get better. Just … live. So you think you could give that a shot for me?"
""
"(There is a brief silence before his heart rate and pulse start dropping. The monitors start beeping rapidly)"
""
"IZZIE: Oh no."

"(She sees Meredith outside and calls out to her)"
""
"IZZIE: Meredith! Meredith!"
""
"MEREDITH: What?"
""
"(Meredith walks in the room with Izzie)"
""
"IZZIE: He’s crashing."
""
"MEREDITH: Well, what the hell are you doing?  Call the code!"
""
"IZZIE: I can’t. I’m not supposed to. He’s brain dead."
""
"MEREDITH: Well Izzie, if he’s brain dead, you have to let him go."
""
"IZZIE: No. It’s only been five hours and thirty-three minutes.  He’s supposed to get six hours."
""
"(The monitors slowly return to normal and Meredith looks through his chart)"
""
"MEREDITH: Well, we can’t do anything to help him live. It’s not our place to make that call."
""
"IZZIE: He’s a person, we’re doctors. We should have every right to make that call. We can’t just stand here and do nothing while he dies. He has a right to the next twenty-seven minutes."
""
"MEREDITH:  Screw it. I’ll get the dopamine, you get the blood.  We’ll transfuse him."

"LLOYD: No. And nice eyes. Kind. I like a man with kind eyes."

"MEREDITH (calls out): He’s stable."
""
"CRISTINA: For now. I had a radiologist look at his chest films. He has a traumatic aortic injury. He’s going to rupture and bleed out."

"IZZIE: So he needs surgery."
""
"CRISTINA: If he’s going to remain a viable organ donor, yeah."
""
"IZZIE: If he’s going to live."
""
"CRISTINA: Izzie…"
""
"IZZIE (interrupts): No! I’m not giving up on him. He has the surgery, he lives longer, that’s the point. So I’m going to help find the family, you guys find a way to get him into surgery."
""
"(She heads up the stairs)"
""
"CRISTINA: She’s vice-president of fantasyland."

"CRISTINA: No, we need to go higher than Bailey."

"CRISTINA: Dr Burke, um, I know you’re busy, but our John Doe needs an aortic repair."
""
"DR. BURKE: The guy from this morning? Isn’t he legally dead?"
""
"CRISTINA: Well, yeah, he’s kinda still around? We gave him two units PRBCs and put him on pressers."

"DR. BURKE: On whose orders?"
""
"(She shuts the door and Burke flushes. He makes his way to wash his hands. This time they both open the door)"
""
"MEREDITH: Mine."
""
"DR. BURKE: You gave a brain-dead John Doe a blood transfusion without consulting anyone. And now you want me to repair his heart?"
""
"CRISTINA: Well, yes."
""
"DR. BURKE: You do enjoy crossing the line, don’t you?"
""
"MEREDITH: He is an excellent candidate for organ donation."

"GEORGE: Very. Same type, same size. UNOS couldn’t find a better match, why?"
""
"IZZIE: He’s the chief’s VIP, right?"
""
"GEORGE: Right."
""
"CRISTINA: How much would you kill to be in on a transplant surgery?"
""
"GEORGE: You underestimate me. I’m not a baby, I’m your colleague. You don’t have to manipulate me. If you want something all you have to do is ask."

"ALEX: What’re you doing?"

"GEORGE: We should watch the skin grafting one first."

"GEORGE (fumbles): Well … I’m ah … no."

"ALEX: Yeah, but I helped."

"IZZIE: Mrs Davidson? He’s ready if you’d like to see him."

"FRIEND #3: Yeah?"

"DR. BAILEY: Is he okay? No. No, he is not okay, at all. He hurled his body down a concrete mountain at full speed for no good reason.

(Bailey gets more worked up) Hey, hey, that’s fine. You want to kill yourselves, flying down a concrete mountain, go to it, but there are other people walking, people driving, people trying live their lives on that concrete mountain, and one of them got his (Meredith tries to interrupt) brains scrambled today because one of you little sniffling no good snot rag-"

"DR. SHEPARD: It’s not the chase."
""
"MEREDITH: What?"
""
"DR. SHEPARD: You and me. It is not the thrill of the chase. It’s not a game. It’s (he walks up to her) … it’s your tiny ineffectual fists. And your hair."

"MEREDITH (she smiles) My hair?"
""
""
"DR. SHEPARD (he nods): Smells good. And you’re very, very bossy. Keeps me in line."

"LLOYD: Ahh, the pretty ones always come crawling back."

"MVO: There’s another way to survive this competition. A way that no one ever seems to tell you about."

"(Meredith leaves the locker room to go home. She passes by Viper’s room where all his friends have gathered around him hugging him and laughing. He gives her a smile and she smile back)"

"MVO: One you have to learn for yourself. Number five. It’s not about the race at all. There are no winners or losers. Victories are counted by the number of lives saved."

"MEREDITH (smiles): What are we watching? Ooh. (She sits down between George and Izzie and grabs the remote to un-pause) This is the one where my mother -"

"Meredith: To the list, it's your turn."

"Bailey: You make them feel good about you. Why is that important? Cause then they'll talk to you and tell you what's wrong. Why is that important? Because then you can tell you're attending what they need to know during rounds. And why is that important? Because if you make your resident look bad, she'll torture you until you beg for your mama.

"Meredith: None of your business."

"Derek: You a cereal person? Straight out of the box? Or all fruit and fiber-y? (He laughs)Pancakes? Do you like pancakes?"

"Meredith: Fine, leftover grilled cheese. Curiosity satisfied?"

"Derek: That's sad. It's pathetic. A good day starts with a good breakfast."

"Meredith: Look, I'm not being seen with you in this hospital. Learn it, live it. It's unprofessional."

"Cristina: And you have abdominal mass consistent with pancreatic cancer."

"Liz: Oh, and you are hoping they're gonna give me a Whipple. Pancreatic duodectomy. This hospital sees those?maybe once every six months. That's why you got here at 4:30, huh?"
""
"Cristina: 4:00"
""
"Liz: Grabbed my chart before anybody else could see it. Impress Dr. Burke with your pre-round exam so you'd be the logical intern for him to ask to scrub in. Ha-Ha! I know all the tricks, doctor."

"Jorge: Let's do it."
""
"Derek: You haven't heard the downside. See, the tumor is located in a part of your brain where your memory and your personality resides. And because of the fuzzy edges of this type of tumor, I have to cut out a lot. Jorge, you stand a good chance of losing your memories. Of losing who you are."
""
"Sona: Is there any other way?"
""
"Derek: The alternative is gamma or cyberknife treatment with focus radiation. It's less evasive. There's little chance of memory loss or him losing himself but it would only give Jorge maybe three to five years."

"MVO- I mean, seriously, don’t be fooled by all the hot shoes and the great sex and the no parents anywhere telling you to do. Adulthood is responsibility."
""
"Caretaker- The lawyer has been managing the estate with a limited power of attorney, but your mother’s Alzheimer’s is advancing so while she’s still lucid enough to consent, she needs to sign everything over to you."
""
"Meredith- Me?"
""
"MVO- Responsibility, it really does suck."
""
"Meredith- [raspy] Look, I haven’t slept in 48 hours. I’m getting my first shot at heart surgery this morning. I’m missing rounds. Are you sure there isn’t anybody here, or the attorney? I mean, do I really have to be the one to handle this?"
""
"Caretaker- We’re talking about her estate, her finances, her medical care. You really want to leave her life in someone else’s hands? She’s your mother."
""
"MVO- Really, really sucks."
""
"[Cut to O.R. where the heart surgery is taking place]"
""
"MVO- Adults have to be places and do things and earn a living and pay the rent. And if you’re training to be a surgeon, holding a human heart in your hands. Hello! Talk about responsibility."
""
"[We see Meredith closing her eyes and dozing off for a second. Her hand squeezes the heart she’s holding]"
""
"Burke- What was that Dr. Grey?"
""
"Meredith- Sorry, it slipped. My hands."
""
"Burke- It’s okay, I’m done. You can release Mrs. Patterson’s heart now. Very gently. All right. Let’s warm her up. Get her off bypass."
""
"MVO- Kinda makes bikes and cookies look really really good, doesn’t it?"
""
"[Cut to Observation Deck]"
""
"George- I wish I could hold a heart"
""
"Christina- A monkey could hold a heart."
""
"George- You’re mad Burke didn’t ask you."
""
"Izzie- George, I need more ice and chips."
""
"George- Who else did you invite?"
""
"Christina- Izzie, we said the list was jocks only. Surgery, Trauma, Plastics. Who else?"
""
"Izzie- Just some people from Peds."
""
"Christina- You invited the preschoolers to Meredith’s house. The next thing you’ll say is you invited the shrinks."
""
"[Izzie looks away]"
""
"Christina- She invited mental defects. This party’s D.O.A."
""
"George- You know, Meredith thinks this is just going to be a little, small, meet-your-boyfriend cocktail thing. Did you clear this with her?"
""
"Izzie- No, but I will. [George and Christina give her a look] I promise."
""
"Christina- Why are you wasting the only weekend your boyfriend is in town on a big party? Is he bad in bed?"
""
"Izzie- [chuckles] No. I just want him to meet some of my friends."
""
"Christina- Right. Sixty geeks in scrubs are your friends. [Her beeper goes off. She gets up to leave] Bad sex, sucks for you."
""
"Alex- I heard there was a party tonight at Meredith’s house."
""
"Christina- Oh really, party?"
""
"Izzie- Uh, news to me."
""
"George- No party."
""
"Alex- Are we losing her or what?"
""
"[Cut back to O.R.]"
""
"Random Doctor- the grats?"
""
"Burke- They’re open. Temperature?"
""
"Random Doctor 2- She’s at 96 and rising."
""
"Burke- She should be doing this on her own [He strokes the heart. Flat line] C’mon, Mrs. Patterson. Paddles."
""
"Random Doctor 2- Sets are below 90."
""
"Random Doctor 3- Charge"
""
"Burke- 10 joules. [puts paddles to heart] Clear. [shocks] C’mon Mrs. Patterson. Give me 20."
""
"Random Doctor3- Charge."
""
"Burke- There, we have rhythm. Here we go. Reluctant heart. All right. Let’s close. Keep an eye on her. Good work, everyone."
""
"MVO- The scariest part about responsibility- when you screw up and let it slip right through your fingers."
""
"[Close up of Meredith’s glove. Her fingernail seems to have cut through it.]"
""
"[Cut to hallway where we see Derek walking and eating at the same time. He runs into George and Meredith]"
""
"DEREK- Hey, I hear you did a capage(?) with Burke."
""
"Meredith- yeah."
""
"Derek- Did you hold the heart?"
""
"Meredith- yeah."
""
"Derek- It’s an amazing feeling. You never forget your first time."
""
"George- It was pretty great just to watch. Vicarious thrills, you know?"
""
"Meredith- yeah."
""
"[Elevator bell rings. George and Meredith get in. She looks out of it. Derek stands outside the elevator, looking concerned]"
""
"Derek- See you later."
""
"Meredith- Bye."
""
"[Elevator doors close. George and Meredith are alone. George is reading something, leaning on the wall. Meredith stands with her arms crossed, facing the door.]"
""
"Meredith- I think maybe I did something to the heart when I was holding it. I nodded off a little. Squeezed it."
""
"George- Oh, the heart’s a tough muscle. It could take a squeeze or two."
""
"Meredith- My fingernail popped the glove. Cut straight through. George, what if I punctured Mrs. Patterson’s heart?"
""
"[George stops reading and stands next to Meredith]"
""
"George- If--- If you had punctured it, you would have know when they reperfused. They got her heart beating. The woman’s okay."
""
"Meredith- So I shouldn’t tell Burke?"
""
"George- Tell him what? You know, um, nothing happened. The woman’s okay, right?"
""
"Meredith- [hesitates] She’s okay."
""
"George- She’s fine."
""
"Meredith-She’s fine."
""
"[Opening sequence]"
""
"[Cut to Hospital Room]"
""
"Bailey- What do you see, George?"
""
"George- Hyper-inflated lungs, clouded with bullae(?), seriously diminished capacity. She must be having trouble breathing."
""
"Bailey- Course of action?"
""
"George- A bulectomy(?) procedure, remove the bullae, reduce the pressure."
""
"Webber- Says here we operated on her back in ’99, so Mrs. Drake as been through this before, but talk her through it anyway. And resist the anti-smoking lecture, she feels bad enough already."
""
"[Webber leaves. George walks over to Bailey, who is looking at x-rays]"
""
"George- So you think if they put pictures of these on a pack of cigarettes people will stop smoking?"
""
"[Bailey gives him a look and shakes her head slightly. George looks awkwardly away]"
""
"[Cut to hospital room]"
""
"Alex- How long has your back been hurting you?"
""
"Patient- It’s chronic. That means I have it all the time."
""
"Alex- I know what “chronic” means. What kind of pain are you having?"
""
"Patient- The pain’s bad. It’s like a thousand samurai warriors stabbing swords into my spine. I’m allergic to aspirin…(?)"
""
"Alex- So maybe we’ll start you on morphine."
""
"Patient- Mmmm…The only things that will work are Demerol or, uh, Dilotta(?) a ton of Dilotta. That will set me straight."
""
"[Close up of the Patient’s arm, lots of scars from needles]"
""
"Alex- The standard starting dose is two."
""
"Patient- Did you see that Tom Cruise Samurai movie? Hmm? Pow, pow, pow!"
""
"[Cut to Alex and Derek outside room]"
""
"Alex- Exaggerated and overly specific description of his pain, self prescription, “pow pow pow”? He’s a Dilotta junkie."
""
"Derek- So what do you do?"
""
"Alex- Well, you check the database for history, refer to a program, discharge."
""
"Derek- After you give him something."
""
"Alex- That’s exactly what he wants."
""
"Derek- Junkie or not, you still have to treat his pain as if it were real. [His pager goes off]"
""
"Alex- Why?"
""
"Derek- First rule in pain management: always err on the side of caution. He’s in our care. He says he’s in pain. Start a central line, his veins are shot."
""
"[Alex looks on incredulously and walks off]"
""
"[Cut to lung patient’s room]"
""
"Mrs. Drake-The surgery before was supposed to help, but it—it never felt right. [She takes off her glasses]"
""
"George- Probably a good idea to quit smoking."
""
"Mrs. Drake- I did! Four pack a day habit. Oh, it was hell."
""
"Nurse- Here you go, Mrs. Drake. [Gives her a blanket]"
""
"Mrs. Drake- It didn’t do any damn good."
""
"George- Really? Because it looked, I mean, from the damage, we all thought you probably were still smoking."
""
"Mrs. Drake- Cold turkey. Five years ago. What do I get for my trouble? I still had to quit my job at the restaurant. But even sitting, it hurt."
""
"Nurse- Here you go. [Adjusts her pillow]"
""
"Mrs. Drake- Nobody believed me. They all said it was in my head."
""
"George- I’ve seen the films. It’s not all in your head."
""
"Mrs. Drake- You’re right about that. Hey, come here. [George moves closer] You’re too damn young to be a doctor."
""
"George- Hey, I’m older than I look."
""
"[They start wheeling her away]"
""
"Mrs. Drake- [smiles] Do you think this is going to work this time?"
""
"George- I think it’s your best option."
""
"Mrs. Drake- Straight-shooter, huh?"
""
"George- Yes, ma’am."
""
"Mrs. Drake- I like that."
""
"[Cut to room where Mrs. Patterson is. Her husband is with her. Grey watches them for a while, then approaches]"
""
"Meredith- Hi, Mr. Patterson."
""
"Mr. Patterson- Hi."
""
"Meredith- Hemodynamics stable?"
""
"Nurse- Hemo…(?) at 80, cardiac output at 5."
""
"Mr. Patterson- That’s good, Dr. Grey?"
""
"Meredith- That’s fine, Mr. Patterson."
""
"Mr. Patterson- But it’s not good."
""
"Meredith- Well, heart surgery takes a lot out of the patient, but we’re monitoring your wife very carefully and she should be fine."
""
"[Cut to hospital room.]"
""
"Izzie- Mr. Sturman, let’s see about getting you out of here today. How are you feeling?"
""
"Mr. Sturman- Pretty okay, except I don’t think I ever wanna have a bowel obstruction again."
""
"Izzie- Really? Wow, because we get people in here all the time requesting them. So are you keeping down clear fluids? And my all time favorite question to ask a patient: have you pooped yet?"
""
"Mr. Sturman- Um, I’m not exactly sure."
""
"[She continues examining]"
""
"Izzie- I think you’d probably know. Passed gas?"
""
"Mr. Sturman- [hesitates] Yes."
""
"Izzie- Really yes? Cause if I bring in my handy lie detector…"
""
"Mr. Sturman- Okay, no. And I shouldn’t try and lie. I know. I went to medical school."
""
"Izzie- You went to med school?"
""
"Mr. Sturman- Yeah, dropped out my last year at clinical. Too many hours and I was staring into the ice-cold eyes of divorce."
""
"Izzie- Wow."
""
"Mr. Sturman- Yeah, I do research now. And I have a life, a family. No offense. I mean…"
""
"Izzie- No, no. It’s okay. I’m just one of those people who believe you can have both."
""
"Mr. Sturman- Maybe so, but your first responsibility is always going to be your patient."
""
"[Izzie walks out of the room. Burke walks by her. He’s carrying two cups of coffee. Christina is standing at a counter nearby. He puts one cup down next to her. She looks at the coffee then at him. He sips his cup. He looks back at her]"
""
"Burke- It’s just coffee. [smiles]"
""
"[Christina looks confused]"
""
"Christina- good."
""
"Burke- Okay."
""
"Christina- Okay."
""
"[Burke nods and walks away. Christina closes her file, hesitates and picks up the coffee and drinks it. Burke peeks around the corner and watches her walk away.]"
""
"[Cut to Locker Room]"
""
"[Meredith is splashing her face with water at a sink. She looks at herself in the mirror.]"
""
"[Cut to O.R. for Mrs. Drake]"
""
"Bailey- We call this a spaghetti procedure. We cut and deflate the bullae to facilitate gentle manipulation of Mrs. Drake’s lung."
""
"Webber- Dr. Bailey, do you see that?"
""
"Bailey- Sir? Oh my ever-lovin’…"
""
"Webber- We need to open her up. I’m taking out the scope."
""
"Bailey- You heard him, people. Let’s move."
""
"Webber- Lights. Let’s get set up. 10 blade. Get the scalpel ready. Towel."
""
"Bailey- Rib spreader."
""
"Webber- Suction."
""
"[They start pulling something black out of Mrs. Drake]"
""
"George- Is that a towel?"
""
"Bailey- Yeah."
""
"George- Where did that come from?"
""
"Webber- Best guess, her surgery five years ago."
""
"Bailey- Somethin’ careless this way comes."
""
"[Cut to George, Christina, Bailey and Webber walking in a hallway.]"
""
"Christina- A towel?"
""
"Webber- Not good."
""
"George- She complained about pressure on her chest. Said nobody took her seriously."
""
"Webber- Not good for the patient, not good for the hospital. Not good."
""
"Bailey- Christina, hit the files. Find out everything you can about that initial operation. Who was in that room, who was responsible for closing. George, you stay with the patient. Keep her happy, she seems to like you."
""
"George- Right, okay, um, how long do you think I—I mean just technically, I’m off at 6:00."
""
"Bailey- Am I invited?"
""
"George- Excuse me?"
""
"Bailey- Am I invited to the party?"
""
"George- [surprised] Oh! You, well, yeah. Yes. Yeah. Of course."
""
"[Bailey walks away. Christina gives George a look]"
""
"George- What was I supposed to say?"
""
"Christina- Ugh!!"
""
"[Cut to Izzie talking on the phone]"
""
"Izzie- Yeah, great. All right. 14 cases. Uh, what kind, I dunno, maybe an assortment?"
""
"[Alex walks up to her]"
""
"Alex- Microbrews, locals. Make sure they throw in some bar nuts."
""
"Izzie- I’m ordering office supplies."
""
"Alex- Oh yeah, sure."
""
"[He walks away]"
""
"Izzie- Microbrews, locals, throw in some bar nuts. 7 o’clock would be better than 5:00."
""
"[Mr. Sturman walks by]"
""
"Izzie- Uh, hey, any luck?"
""
"Mr. Sturman- No, hey, if I do, will you invite me to the party?"
""
"Izzie- [laughs] Okay great, thanks."
""
"[Cut to Back Pain Guy’s room. He is squirming in pain. Derek walks by and sees.]"
""
"Derek- Hey, Mr. Frost. We’re going to take care you of. Just hang on."
""
"Mr. Frost- Were the hell have you been?!"
""
"[Cut to Research room]"
""
"Derek- When I tell you to start a central line, you start a central line. No judgment, no question."
""
"Alex- The guy’s been in seven hospitals in the last 4 months. He’s a major addict."
""
"Derek- The patient has a three lumbar fusion."
""
"Alex- He’s a junkie. I mean we shouldn’t be giving him—"
""
"Derek- Yeah! He’s an addict. But his pain is real. Now, lose the attitude, get down there, start a central line."
""
"[Alex gets up and leaves the room]"
""
"[Cut to Mrs. Drake’s room]"
""
"Mrs. Drake- [with difficulty] Told me I had a towel inside me."
""
"George- Who told you that?"
""
"Mrs. Drake- A surgeon, uh, older man, handsome."
""
"George- That’s Dr. Webber, he’s our chief."
""
"Mrs. Drake- Yeah. It was a towel that somebody left last time."
""
"George- Yes, ma’am."
""
"Mrs. Drake- Who would do that? [voice breaking] That doesn’t seem right, does it?"
""
"George- No, ma'am, no. It doesn’t."
""
"Mrs. Drake- I was walking around with a towel inside of me. How could that happen?"
""
"[Cut to a room with a lot of filing cabinets]"
""
"[Christina is looking through files. She finds the right one. It says that Burke was the Surgical Fellow in the O.R. for Mrs. Drake’s operation in 1999. She looks up, concerned.]"
""
"[Cut to Christina showing Bailey the file]"
""
"Christina- So? What happens now?"
""
"Bailey- Now, you keep this to yourself while we work it out. [She takes the file and begins to walk away] Do this for me."
""
"[Christina nods]"
""
"[Cut to Meredith at a counter with a file]"
""
"[Derek walks up to her]"
""
"Derek- Are you okay?"
""
"Meredith- Yeah, yeah, I’m good."
""
"Derek- Are you sure, ‘cause you seem not okay."
""
"Meredith- I’m fine. Cappage(?) was long."
""
"Derek- Well, let me take you out to dinner tonight. You can tell me all about it. Real food, waiters, big chunks of carbs in a basket."
""
"Meredith- I can’t."
""
"Derek- Forget about the party."
""
"Meredith- You know about the party?"
""
"Derek- Your friends will be at the party. You and I can be alone somewhere else."
""
"Meredith- How do you know about the party?"
""
"Derek- Thanks for not inviting me, by the way. That felt good. Dinner, think about dinner, perfect opportunity."
""
"Meredith- Well— [Beeper]"
""
"[Derek walks away. Meredith runs in the opposite direction.]"
""
"[Cut to Mrs. Patterson]"
""
"Nurse- Started having some swelling over the sternum and then the blood just started gushing. Dr. Burke is on his way right now."
""
"Mr. Patterson- Is she dying?"
""
"Meredith- Somebody get him out of here. Keep applying pressure."
""
"Burke- Tyler, call for an O.R. What the hell happened? She got a proteome(?)"
""
"Meredith- Her protocol. No allergic anaphylactic or histamine responses."
""
"Burke- Her last counts?"
""
"Meredith- B.T., P.T.T., I.N.R. platelet counts were all stable. Even her H.N.H. were stable."
""
"Burke- What the hell went wrong? Let’s move."
""
"Nurse- Hold on."
""
"Meredith- I popped a glove."
""
"Burke- What?"
""
"Meredith- In surgery, when I was holding it. I popped a glove with my fingernail. I think I may have nicked her heart."
""
"Burke- Let’s go, people."
""
"[Mr. Patterson looks on as they wheel his wife away]"
""
"[Cut to O.R.]"
""
"Burke- You had every opportunity to speak up before I closed her chest. Every opportunity. Suction."
""
"MEREDITH- I’m sorry."
""
"Burke- And then going to confess in front of her husband? You don’t even know if you were the cause. You have no idea."
""
"Meredith- I’m sorry."
""
"Burke- There. Over here. [motions for Meredith to go look] There, look at the wall rupture. That’s a hell of a lot more than a fingernail. Her ventricular wall was weak."
""
"[Webber walks in]"
""
"Webber- I just had a conversation with Mr. Patterson. I want copies of his wife’s chart in my office by 5:00. Tomorrow morning, the two of you are going to meet with me and legal and you better damn well be able to explain what happened here. [Starts to leave.] [Mutters to himself] People poking holes in hearts, leaving towels in people."
""
"Burke- You’re going to go back and talk to the husband. Review the history. Apologize. Profusely. Your ass is on the line here, Dr. Grey."
""
"[Cut to Christina, George and Meredith sitting in hallway]"
""
"George- You got called in from the chief?"
""
"Meredith- Tomorrow morning. I could get kicked out of the program. I could, right?"
""
"George- You’re not going to get kick out."
""
"Christina- Patterson’s just going to sue."
""
"George- Patterson is not going to sue and you’re not getting kicked out."
""
"Christina- What the hell are you thinking? Telling Burke. So stupid."
""
"George- I told her not to."
""
"[Meredith’s phone rings]"
""
"Meredith- I gotta take this. Thanks. Thank you. Very comforting."
""
"George- I’ll watch your books."
""
"[Meredith walks away. Izzie arrives with coffee, a banana, water, pudding and other things in hand. Christina takes the coffee and banana. George takes the pudding and water bottle.]"
""
"Izzie- So the beer’s coming at 7:00 and some of the floor nurses are bringing wine."
""
"Christina- You invited nurses? Ugh."
""
"George- Did you clear this with Meredith?"
""
"Izzie- A few more people isn’t going to make a difference. Okay? A party’s a party."
""
"Christina- And the bigger the party, the less time for bad sex with the hockey player."
""
"Izzie- Would you stop saying that? Hank and I have great sex."
""
"Christina- Mmhmm"
""
"Izzie- All the time."
""
"Christina- Mmhmm."
""
"Izzie- In fact, we’ll probably have sex after the party, or during the party."
""
"George- As long as you clear it with Meredith."
""
"Izzie- Hank just needs to realize that doctors can have fun. We’re not all workaholics with God complexes."
""
"Christina- We ARE workaholics with God complexes."
""
"[Izzie gives her a look. George shows her an inflated glove puppet with a drawn on face.]"
""
"[Cut to Meredith on the phone next to a window]"
""
"Meredith- And the notary can be there at 6:30 too? And the home’s physician will be there attest to her mental competency. Okay, is there anything else I need to bring besides my license? My checkbook. 6:30, I’ll be there."
""
"[She hangs up. Derek walks up to her, leans on the railing.]"
""
"Derek- I heard."
""
"Meredith- It’s a notary thing. A thing to get notarized."
""
"Derek- I’m talking about the heart thing. Do you want to talk about it?"
""
"Meredith- We’re adults. When did that happen? And how do we make it stop?"
""
"[She walks away]"
""
"[Cut to Christina putting a chart away. Burke is there too. She looks at him awkwardly]"
""
"Burke- Dr. Yang."
""
"Christina- Dr. Burke. [pause] That bypass graft got a little complicated."
""
"Burke- It’s nothing I couldn’t handle."
""
"Christina- Good."
""
"[She walks away]"
""
"[Cut to Mr. Patterson outside of the hospital talking on the phone]"
""
"Mr. Patterson- Uh huh, yeah. Listen, I’ll call you back."
""
"[Meredith walks up]"
""
"Mr. Patterson- That was my lawyer. He was advising me not to talk to you."
""
"Meredith- Mr. Patterson, I know that you’re frustrated and angry, but I need, we need, some more information about your wife. The walls of her heart are abnormally thin—"
""
"Mr. Patterson- Don’t blame this on my wife. I heard from your very mouth what happened. I know."
""
"Meredith- But we can’t treat her."
""
"Mr. Patterson- She was in the best shape of her life. You ask a cardiologist. She had lost 100 pounds. Don’t you dare try to hang this on her."
""
"Meredith- Mr. Patterson, please."
""
"Mr. Patterson- We’re through talking."
""
"[He leaves]"
""
"[Cut to Alex giving Mr. Frost his central line]"
""
"Mr. Frost- You don’t like me very much, do you?"
""
"Alex- No, Jerry, it’s not you specifically, it’s just uh, it’s people like you, that’s all."
""
"[Derek walks in]"
""
"Mr. Frost- Doc! Feeling pretty good. The pain’s about a 3."
""
"Derek- A three? That’s excellent. Mr. Frost, I’m glad we could help you out. As well as County, Mercy West, Seattle Pres., a lot of people helped you out, Jerry. Pleased we could do our part. Who’s on discharge today, Dr. Karev?"
""
"Alex- Izzie Stevens."
""
"Derek- Mr. Frost, Dr. Stevens is going to come in here and discharge you."
""
"Mr. Frost- Whoa whoa whoa, you can’t discharge me. I’m in pain."
""
"Derek- You were in pain. Now you’re not. Dr. Karev is going to recommend some wonderful treatment programs for you. Go home. Get some help."
""
"Mr. Frost- You can’t just do that."
""
"[Derek leaves]"
""
"Alex- He just did, my friend."

"[Cut to Mr. Sturman’s room]"
""
"Izzie- Okay, any luck yet?"
""
"Mr. Sturman- Nada."
""
"Izzie- Looks like you’re going to have to spend another night."
""
"Mr. Sturman- Oh, I’d hate to miss the party. Are you going to make it?"
""
"Izzie- Well, you are the last person on my list so it’s looking pretty good."
""
"Mr. Sturman- So, doctors have lives after all. Who’d have thunk?"
""
"Derek- Dr. Stevens, discharge my guy in 342."

"Izzie- Don’t look at me like that. It’s not going to take very long. It’s not."

"[She leaves]"

"[Cut to reception]"

"[George walks over to Izzie]"
""
"George- You paged me?"
""
"Izzie- I’m gonna be a while. Do you think you could get home to sign for the beer?"
""
"Alex- Why don’t you have your boyfriend sign for it?"
""
"Izzie- You have a very annoying way of sneaking up on people. Maybe if you were a little less creepy."
""
"Alex- I wouldn’t come anyway. I hate big parties."
""
"George- Is Meredith the only person in the hospital who doesn’t know the size of this thing?"
""
"Izzie- I’m telling her."
""
"Christina- You can’t. She’s gone already."
""
"Izzie- What? Already?"
""
"Christina- I think she had, excuse me, an errand to run."
""
"[Christina walks off]"
""
"Izzie- You don’t think Meredith’s really going to mind about the party, right?"
""
"George- I want you to make it very clear to her that I had nothing to do with this party. Nothing."

"Meredith- Mom? Mom?"

"Ellis- What do you people want from me?"
""
"Meredith- We need you to sign the lawyers’ papers."

"Ellis- I have a cranial reconstruction in a half hour. I need to go."

""
"Ellis- It’s an emergency surgery. I don’t have time for this."
""
"Caretaker- She can’t sign anything now. She’s sun downing. We should have done this earlier in the day."

"Meredith- I couldn’t come earlier in the day. I have a job. And a life. And I’m here now."
""
"Caretaker- Well, you’re going to have to come back tomorrow when she’s lucid."
""
"Meredith- You know, why did she put this off for so long? And why did you let her? Doesn’t it strike you as slightly irresponsible? I mean, what the hell is wrong with you people?"

"Christina- So what’s going to happen?"

"Derek- The hole? Interesting expression."

"[Izzie looks on]"

"Christina- Give me that. You’re drunk."

"Christina- Oh, you must be Hank. [She laughs and stands up] He’s very large and hockey-like. No, Izzie’s not here right now."
""
"[Christina leaves the room]"
""
"George- You and Izzie would give birth to very tall, blonde people, like Barbies."

"Hank- Izzie said she was going to be at home. She didn’t say there was going to be a party."
""
"Meredith- which pisses both of us off. Would you like some tequila? It helps."

"Hank- When do you think she’s gonna get here?"

"Meredith- Don’t know. But we’re low on ice, Hank."

"Hank- [Chuckles] Oh my god. There was a party at your house."
""
"Izzie- Yeah, did you get a chance to hang out? I wanted you to meet some new people."
""
"Hank- I don’t care about the people you work with. I just want to see you."
""
"Izzie- Hmm, well you didn’t mind meeting the people I worked with when they were models."
""
"Hank- Yeah, well, when they were models, you actually showed up to your own parties."
""
"Izzie- Yeah. [long pause] This is my life now, Hank. I work 100 hour weeks. I can’t always show up to my own parties on time. My patients have to come first."
""
"Hank- Yeah, I just flew across the entire country and there’s 100 people at your house."
""
"Izzie- Yeah, 100 people who understand what I do all day. I shouldn’t have to apologize for that."
""
"Hank- No, you shouldn’t."
""
"[Izzie sighs]"
""
"Izzie- Look, let’s just go by the party for a little while. You’ll really like everyone once you get a chance to know them."

"[She’s outside, swaying drunkenly and drinking. Derek is watching her]"
""
"Derek- You know, in some states, you could get arrested for that."
""
"[She walks towards him]"
""
"Derek- So you blew me off for a bottle of tequila. Tequila’s no good for ya. It doesn’t call. It doesn’t write. It isn’t nearly as much fun to wake up to."
""
"[She smiles and pulls him in for a kiss. They kiss a few times]"
""
"Meredith- Take me for a ride, Derek."
""
"[Cut to Derek’s car]"
""
"[Derek is in the driver’s seat. Meredith is straddling him. He’s not wearing a shirt and she’s wearing her bra. Derek pulls his shirt over her shoulders.]"
""
"Derek- You know, it sounds like the party’s winding down. Listen to me. We should probably sneak inside, though."
""
"Meredith- We’ve done enough sneaking for the night. It was good sneaking, but enough sneaking."
""
"Derek- Yeah, I think we’re good sneakers."
""
"[They start kissing. There’s tapping on the window. It’s Dr. Bailey.]"
""
"Bailey- You mind moving this tail wagon? You’re blocking me in."
""
"Derek- Apparently not good enough."
""
"[Cut to next morning at Meredith’s house]"
""
"[George walks through the debris of snacks and bottles over to the couch. He hands Meredith, who is lying on the floor, a mug]"
""
"George- When’s your meeting with the chief?"
""
"[He sits down, throws something off to the side]"
""
"Meredith- In an hour."
""
"[Izzie comes home, looks around, shocked]"
""
"Izzie- Holy mother of destruction."
""
"Meredith- You missed Doctor-palooza."
""
"[Izzie takes off her shoes and walks towards them]"
""
"Izzie- Apparently, you didn’t."
""
"Meredith- I should probably never speak to you again."
""
"Izzie- Ugh, I’m so sorry, Meredith. I had no idea it was gonna get so—"
""
"Meredith- It’s okay. Really, I don’t care. What would I be doing anyway?"
""
"George- Preparing for your career-altering meeting? Sorry."
""
"Meredith- That heart wall shouldn’t have torn."
""
"[Izzie picks up a beer]"
""
"Izzie- Anything in the patient’s history?"
""
"Meredith- Husband says she was in the best shape of her life. She lost 100 pounds last year."
""
"Izzie- 100 pounds in a year, how’s her muscle mass?"
""
"[Izzie drinks]"
""
"George- Do you even know whose that was?"
""
"Izzie- I was hoping it was yours."
""
"George- [looks disgusted] No."
""
"[Cut to George, Christina and Izzie standing in hospital outside of Meredith’s meeting]"
""
"Izzie- So, what do you think?"
""
"Christina- 50 says Meredith gets tossed out on her ass and Burke walks away clean."
""
"George- Please be nice to her."
""
"[Cut to inside the meeting]"
""
"Meredith- So, I have done a lot of research on this and Dr. Burke has been kind enough to help me. And I understand my responsibility, and what I’ve done wrong here. However, I do think the patient’s history is significant in this case. She still weighs 200 pounds, which is why no one even noticed it, but with that kind of a weight drop, it doesn’t matter how much you weigh, technically, you’re anorexic."
""
"Burke- So, along with all that fat, she was losing muscle, heart muscle."
""
"Webber- That certainly could be a reason for a small poke to become a large tear."
""
"Lawyer- That still doesn’t change the fact that the small poke wasn’t reported by Dr. Grey at the time of the occurrence."
""
"Meredith- And if I could change that---"
""
"Lawyer- And you can’t, but you’ve left yourself and the hospital to a tremendous amount of liability."
""
"Burke- No, not if the patient’s weight loss caused the problem."
""
"Lawyer- I’m sorry. I have no choice here."
""
"Burke- I’ve spoken to the husband. And I believe as long as his wife remains stable—"
""
"Lawyer- I can’t take your beliefs to the bank, Dr. Burke. Dr. Grey made a huge error."
""
"Burke- And she reported it."
""
"Lawyer- Too late. And in front of the patient’s husband."
""
"Burke- But she reported it. She spoke up. [pause] Five years ago, as a CT fellow, I had a nagging feeling that I didn’t check the body cavity of a lung patient closely enough before I closed. The patient seemed fine post-op and I was in a hurry. And yesterday, you and Dr. Bailey pulled a towel out from under that patient’s lung. Why didn’t I report it at the appropriate time? Maybe because I was afraid that I would be called into a meeting where some hospital lawyer’s fear of liability could end my career. Even great doctors make mistakes. And when we do, we’ve got to have a chance to be able to speak up without fear of retribution. Or everyone suffers. Dr. Grey spoke up."
""
"MVO- Responsibility. It really does suck."
""
"[Cut to Meredith leaving the meeting]"
""
"[She starts to walk towards the three when intercepted by Derek]"
""
"Derek- Meredith, you okay?"
""
"Meredith- Yeah. One month probation."
""
"Derek- Good. That’s good. [He leaves]"
""
"Meredith- Burke saved my ass in there."
""
"Bailey- Don’t you all have something better to do? C’mon people, move!"
""
"[George, Christina, Izzie and Meredith hurry away. Bailey pulls Christina aside]"
""
"Bailey- He was always gonna tell them about the towel. Just wanted to wait for the right time. Information is power."
""
"[Bailey walks off. Christina looks in Burke’s direction. He shakes Webber’s hand and turns around, seeing Christina. She runs off in the opposite direction to get back to work]"
""
"[Cut to nursing home]"
""
"[Caretaker is watching Ellis sign forms]"
""
"MVO- Unfortunately, once you get past the age of braces and training bras, responsibility doesn’t go away."
""
"[Cut to hospital, Frost’s room]"
""
"Alex- Jerry, this is Sloan. She’s here to talk to you, if you want, about options for rehab."
""
"MVO- It can’t be avoided."
""
"[Cut to Mrs. Drake’s room]"
""
"[Burke is sitting next to her bed]"
""
"Burke- Mrs. Drake, I cannot begin to tell you how truly sorry I am."
""
"MVO- Either someone makes us face it, or we suffer the consequences."
""
"[Cut to Derek jogging up a staircase. He runs into Bailey, they exchange awkward looks]"
""
"[Cut to Izzie walking past Mr. Sturman’s room]"
""
"Mr. Sturman- Izzie! I did it. I pooped!"
""
"Izzie- [laughs] All right!"
""
"[Alex walks up behind her and taps her on the shoulder]"
""
"Alex- Missed your party?"
""
"Izzie- Life as a surgeon."
""
"Alex- And loving every minute of it."
""
"[They split up and walk in different directions]"
""
"[Cut to on-call room]"
""
"[Burke is taking off his shoes and shirt. Christina walks in. They see each other. She locks the door]"
""
"MVO- And still, adulthood has its perks."
""
"Christina- Thanks for the coffee."
""
"[Burke walks over and kisses her. They kiss passionately and begin to undress each other]"
""
"[Cut to Meredith, George, Christina, and Izzie cleaning up after the party]"
""
"MVO- I mean the shoes, the sex, the no parents anywhere telling you what to do. That’s pretty damn good"

""
"S1E6"

"(Meredith lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. It is storming outside and her alarm starts buzzing.)"
""
"MVO: This is the man who discovered electricity. You'd think more of us would listen to what he had to say."
""
"(George walking through the hall towards Meredith's room with two cups of coffee. Izzie comes out into the hall. George spills the coffee on himself.)"
""
"MVO: I don't know why we put things off, but if I had to guess, I'd say it has a lot to do with fear. Fear of failure, fear of pain, fear of rejection."
""
"Izzie: Wouldn't it be easier to just ask her out?"
""
"(George walks away and Meredith hits snooze again.)"
""
"George: She's gonna be late."
""
"Izzie: Maybe not."
""
"George: We should wait for her."
""
"Izzie: Definitely not. I'm not her mother, and you are not her boyfriend. Not yet, anyway."
""
"George: Stop, ok? I told you I'm not interested."
""
"Izzie: Life is short, George. Do you really want to die before you ever ask her out?"
""
"George: I do not want to ask her out."
""
"Izzie: Do you really want to die a liar?"
""
"George: I'm not...I'm not dying."
""
"MVO: Sometimes, the fear is just of making a decision."
""
""
"(Scene: SGH parking lot, Meredith is rushing)"
""
"MVO: Because, what if you're wrong? What if you're making a mistake you can't undo?"
""
"(Derek arrives and parks next to Meredith)"

"Meredith: Crap."
""
"Derek: Crap?"
""
"Meredith: Hi. I'm late."

"Derek: You're avoiding me."

"Meredith: Yes, but also late."
""
"Derek: Ok, are we going to talk about this?"
""
"Meredith: No."
""
"Derek: About us and Bailey and what she saw?"
""
"Meredith: I don't need to talk about it. I experienced it, naked."
""
"Derek: This is getting complicated."
""
"Meredith: Complicated for me. I'm the intern sleeping with the attending. Bailey isn't speaking to me anymore."
""
"Derek: Not that that's a bad thing. If I was a better guy, I'd walk away."

"Meredith: Yes, you would."

"Derek: Do you want me to be a better guy?"

"Cristina: No, he's her boss too."
""
"Meredith: If they find out, what can they...? Can they kick me out, or...?"

"Cristina: No... Not officially. You'll just get edged out, blacklisted, banned from his surgeries, passed over for chief resident. (Sighs) It'll be humiliating, but you'll live."

"Meredith: What?"

"Bailey: Cristina, you're late."
""
"Cristina: So is Meredith."
""
"MVO: Whatever it is we're afraid of, one thing holds true. That, by the time the pain of not doing a thing gets worse than the fear of doing it, it can feel like we're carrying around a giant tumor."
""
"Bailey: When we walk in this door, you will maintain decorum. You will not laugh, vomit, or drop you jaw. Are we understood?"

""
"Burke: Good morning."
""
"Alex: Annie, this is Dr. Burke (Whispers) Awesome surgeon."
""
"Bailey: Dr. Karev."
""
"Alex: Annie Connors is a 43-year-old woman who presented last night with progressive shortness of breath for the past three months. Found to have a very large tumor of unknown origin pressed against her diaphragm. Stable vital signs. Scheduled for CT this morning, sir."
""
"Burke: Thank you, Dr. Karev. (To Annie) Are you at all claustrophobic?"
""
"Annie: I've been housebound for the last year. How claustrophobic could I be?"
""
"Burke: All right then. Dr. Stevens is going to take you up for a CT. It'll give us a better look at the tumor, and we'll know how to proceed."

"Annie: Could someone tell my mom? She'll worry if she gets back and I'm not here."

"Meredith: ""Seemed"" being the operative word."
""
"Alex: He was on call last night when she came in. I am never leaving this place again."
""
"Bailey: Let's move, people. Ms. Connor's surgery, should we choose to proceed, will take most, if not all, of the surgeons off the floor, which means you people will have to work extra hard not to kill anyone, ?cause we won't be there to fix your mistakes."

"Izzie: For Parkinson's disease? Um, deep brain stimulation has shown..."

"CT Tech: I've never seen anything like this. God."
""
"Alex: Well, what I don't understand...is how a person lets it get like that. (Annie can hear Alex speaking) I mean, man, that is a whole lot of nasty."
""
"CT Tech: Maybe she's afraid of doctors. Poor thing."
""
"Alex: Poor thing? Please. If you're afraid of doctors, you take a pill. She's just sick, like, warped, you know? Seriously, I don't know how she lives with herself."

"(Cristina talking to Mrs. Connors in the hospital lobby.)"
""
"Mrs. Connors: Well, at first, we thought she was just putting on weight. When we realized what was happening, I tried to get her to go to the doctor, but she was scared. And, the bigger it got, the less she wanted to go. And she never really felt all that sick until last night. She couldn't breathe."
""
"Cristina: Because the tumor was crushing her lungs."
""
"Mrs. Connors: Yes, well, I called 911. It just seemed like the right thing to do."
""
"Cristina: You know, the right thing to do would have been to call a year ago. Thank you."

"Meredith: Ok, Mr. Levangie. We're going to get you more comfortable, ok? I'm going to go downstairs and I'll be back up shortly."
""
"Mr. Levangie: Ok"
""
"Meredith: Ok."
""
"(Meredith leaves; daughter follows her into the hall)"
""
"Ms. Levangie: Excuse me. I'm sorry, doctor..."
""
"Meredith: Grey."
""
"Ms. Levangie: My dad seems to like you. He's always liked skinny blondes. Is that rude? I'm sorry. I'm so tired."
""
"Meredith: Is there something...?"
""
"Ms. Levangie: I was wondering if you would talk to him."
""
"Meredith: About?"
""
"Ms. Levangie: Brain surgery. The doctor mentioned it, and I've read about it online. If it worked, it could help with most of his symptoms, not just his pain."
""
"Meredith: Is he a candidate? I don't..."
""
"Ms. Levangie: He is, but he's afraid of it. Surgery on his back, he can understand, but his brain...And there are risks. But his quality of life..."
""
"Meredith: There isn't any."
""
"Ms. Levangie: And, it keeps getting worse. I'm getting married next month. I already lost my mom. And I want him to walk...I want him with me. Maybe that's selfish, but...you don't know what it's like having a parent...Watching him..."
""
"Meredith: I do. I do know what it's like. I'll see what I can do."
""
"Ms. Levangie: Thanks"
""
"Meredith: You're welcome."
""
"Ms. Levangie: Thank you."
""
""
"(Meredith walks away. Bailey, Derek and Burke are examining x-rays from Annie Connors.)"
""
"Burke: The right hemidiaphragm is so high that it's completely displacing her lung tissue."
""
"Derek: It's infiltrated her spinal canal in three places. We should start there. It's going to take 3 or 4 hours to get around those nerves."
""
"Burke: I'd prefer to start in front, and then flip her. You never know what kind of vessels are involved, how intertwined they are. I'm going to need a good head start."
""
"Derek: I should really go with the spine fresh, if I miss a step, she's paralyzed."
""
"Burke: If I don't relieve the pressure on her lungs, she'll be dead. So, she won't mind if she can't walk."
""
"Bailey: Do you think she really wants to live? Come on. She's been housebound. She's been living under this thing, just watching it grow for how long? She doesn't seem stupid. Doesn't even seem all that scared. Why would anyone wait this long unless they wanted to die?"
""
"Derek: People do things every day that they know could kill them. Doesn't mean they want to die."
""
"Bailey: What are her chances of surviving the surgery?"
""
"Burke: Slightly better than if we do nothing."
""
"Bailey: So is it worth it? (Burke looks at her, Derek sighs) Hey, come on. You were already thinking it, I'm just saying."
""
"Burke: She's 43. It's worth a try."
""
"(Burke leaves)"
""
"Derek: Ha! Morning."
""
"(Derek and Bailey leave, Meredith is waiting in the hall.)"
""
"Meredith: Dr. Shepherd. Mr. Levangie, the Parkinson's patient, is he a good candidate for DBS?"
""
"Derek: Yes, but he's not interested."
""
"Meredith: Ok, but I think it's worth talking to him again, pushing him."
""
"Derek: We're talking about a brain surgery that is performed while the patient is wide awake, a risk of paralysis, a risk of death. And, the patient doesn't want it. It is not my job to push him into anything and it's definitely not yours."
""
"Meredith: Ok."
""
"Derek: Since you clearly uncomfortable with my decision in this case, it's probably best you don't scrub in."
""
"Meredith: But..."
""
"Derek: It's a minor procedure. You won't be missed."

"Derek: (To Bailey) You know, they call you the Nazi."

""
"(Annie Connors room, Burke and Alex are there. Mrs. Connors is making the bed. )"
""
"Burke: I won't lie to you. The surgery is going to be long and difficult, but we have an extremely capable surgical team, and I can..."
""
"Annie: Am I going to die?"
""
"Burke: There's always that risk but if we don't do the surgery..."
""
"Annie: I'll definitely die."
""
"Burke: Yes."

"Burke: Yes."

"Annie: Mom, the room's clean."

"Annie: Mom!"

"Mrs. Connors: She'll have the surgery."
""
"Annie: Mom!"
""
"Mrs. Connors: No. No, Annie. She will have the surgery."
""
"Annie: I guess I'll have the surgery."
""
"Burke: I think that is a very wise decision."
""
"Annie: On one condition. I don't want him there. (Points at Alex)"
""
"Alex: I'm sorry, Annie. Did I upset you in some way?"
""
"Annie: If he's in the surgery, I'm not having it. (Pause while Burke and Alex look at her and each other) That's how I live with myself."
""
"Burke: Ok, Miss Connors. (Turns to leave) Dr. Karev."
""
"(Annie and her mom hold hands)"
""
""
"(Burke and Karev walk through hallway)"
""
"Burke: What the hell did you do?"
""
"Alex: Nothing. I-I don't know. Man. The mike must have been on. I was talking to the tech guy..."
""
"Burke: If anything goes wrong, anything, you are 60 percent more likely to be sued if you've offended the patient. 60%."
""
"Alex: I never would have said that stuff. The mike shouldn't have been on. I didn't realize she could hear me."
""
"Burke: Well, now you won't realize you chance to scrub in. You're banned from the OR. Mine or anyone else's. All week."
""
"(Cristina walks up)"
""
"Cristina: I got the history on the tumor. It's been growing for a year and a half. A year and a half and it's the first time she's even had it looked at. It's like she's fatally lazy."
""
"(Burke walks away, shaking his head)"
""
"Alex: Why doesn't she get banned?"
""
"(Burke grabs George who is walking by)"
""
"Burke: Go prep Annie Connors for surgery. You're scrubbing in with Cristina."
""
"George: Really? I mean, thank you. Ok."
""
""
"(George is in Annie Connor's room, prepping her for surgery)"
""
"George: We just need to recheck your labs and get an EKG, so I just need to take a little blood. Dr. Burke is great, and Dr. Bailey. I know you're probably scared."
""
"Annie: That's ok, kitten. You can just do your job. You don't have to talk to the fat, nasty tumor lady. I mean, I let it get this bad. How much sympathy do I deserve?"
""
"George: Why did you let it get this bad?"
""
"Annie: You're the first person since I got here to ask me that."
""
"George: Well, I guess it's just like the elephant in the room."
""
"Annie: Elephant?"
""
"George: I mean..."
""
"Annie: It's more like a giant sow, don't you think? (They smile at each other) Every time I went to the hospital, someone died. All four of my grandparents, then my dad. My best friend's mom, my baby sister. They all went in, never came out. So I put it off."
""
"George: You know, you're not the only one to put things off. I mean I never do anything till the last possible minute."
""
"Annie: Like what?"
""
"George: Well...I've had this thing for my roommate since, like, day one, and I just...I can't tell her. She probably wouldn't go out with me, anyway, but...How do I know that for sure, if I don't ever ask?"
""
"Annie: Seriously? You're equating your pathetic love life with my record-breaking tumor? Seriously?"
""
""
"(Outdoor lunch tables)"
""
"Meredith: It's just that he blatantly favors me in front of her and then blatantly dismisses me."
""
"Cristina: How do you know he was favoring you? Look, you've got a brain. You got into this program. Just because Shepherd wants to munch your cookies doesn't mean you didn't deserve what you worked for."
""
"Meredith: But he's making me look bad. I have to end it."
""
"Cristina: Right."
""
"Meredith: It's over."
""
"Cristina: Uh, huh."
""
"Alex: Is it true you get to scrub in on that tumor?"
""
"Cristina: Don't sit here."
""
"Izzie: You get to scrub in? How psyched are you?"
""
"Cristina: On a scale of one to ecstatic, ecstatic."
""
"Alex: It's unbelievable. You know what I think? I think Burke wants to get into your scrubs."
""
"Cristina: Why are you sitting here?"
""
"Alex: He kicked me off that surgery for the same crap you pull every day."
""
"Cristina: You know what. If I stuck this fork into his thigh, would I get in trouble?"

"Meredith: Not if you make it look like an accident."

"George: Hey!"

"Cristina: He reamed her out in front of Bailey."

"Izzie: Why?"

"Meredith: Cause he's a jackass."

"George: Oh. (Throws his tray) Well, bad days are...bad. Maybe tonight, uh, if, you know, if you drink alcohol, I mean, we could all of us, I mean, go out and drink alcohol...because of the bad day."

"Mr. Levangie: Still good."

"Derek: Good. (To daughter) How are you? Good? (To Mr. Levangie) Can you lean forward for me? I just want to check something. Does that feel ok?"

"Mr. Levangie: Yeah."
""
"Derek: Right here?"
""
"(Meredith enters)"
""
"Meredith: Did you page?"
""
"Derek: Mr. Levangie, have you given any more thought about the other surgical options we discussed this morning?"
""
"Mr. Levangie: What? Why would I? I already told you no. I'm letting you cut into my back, but that's not enough for you. All you guys ever want to do is cut."
""
"Ms. Levangie: Dad, just listen to what he has to say."
""
"Mr. Levangie: I already listened."
""
"Derek: Sir, there's a very small window of opportunity here. You know, once the Parkinson's progresses to a point of dementia, there's, you know, you're no longer a candidate for DBS."
""
"Mr. Levangie: and when I'm no longer a candidate, is that when you people will leave me the hell alone! What? Do I have to start drooling, and forget my name to get a little peace and quiet?"
""
"Derek: All right. I'll check back with you later. Try to get some rest."
""
"(Derek walks away, Meredith lingers in the hall.)"
""
"Ms. Levangie: Dad, you're being unreasonable. The doctors are only trying to help you."
""
"Mr. Levangie: It's my damn life, and it's my damn brain. You want me to let them cut up my brain while I'm lying her awake, for what?"
""
"Ms. Levangie: Dad!"
""
"Mr. Levangie: I'll be at your wedding. I will sit in the back. Your uncle will walk you down the aisle. I know it's not perfect, but it's life. Life is messy sometimes."
""
"Ms. Levangie: I know that."
""
"(Daughter leaves)"
""
"Mr. Levangie: (To Meredith) If she knows, then what the hell are we still talking for, huh? Why in hell can't she drop it?"

"Meredith: It is your life. But it's her life too. And you have a chance to get better here. And all she's asking you to do is try."

"George: Um, sometime I jog, and I try to take the stairs whenever possible."
""
"(Derek enters)"

"Bailey: See that large pile of tumor? You're going to be retracting it for the next 14 hours, so I'm just saying I hope you have strong backs."

"(Meredith enters)"
""
"Meredith: Dr. Shepherd."
""
"Derek: Yes?"
""
"Meredith: Mr. Levangie has agreed to DBS. If we do it today. If he leaves, he won't come back."
""
"Burke: Don't worry, Dr. Shepherd. It'll take hours before we get around to the spine. I'll page you."
""
"Derek: All right, then. (Leaving) Let's do it."
""
""
"(Meredith and Bailey are alone in the scrub room)"
""
"Meredith: Dr. Bailey. I didn't know...that he was my boss, when I met him. I didn't know."
""
"Bailey: I don't care."
""
"Meredith: Really? Oh, well, you sort of seemed to not be talking to me, so I ..."
""
"Bailey: You see this, what's happening right here? This is the problem with you sleeping with my boss. Not whether or not you know him before, but how it affects my day. And me standing here talking to you about your sex life affects my day. And the longer this little fling goes on, the more favors you get over the others, who are fighting tooth and nail just to make it through this program without any assistance. When those people start finding out what's going on and they don't want to work with you and talk to you or look at you, and they start bitching and moaning at me, the more it affects my day. So, no, Dr. Grey, I don't care what you know, or when you know it. Are we understood?"

"Izzie: Mrs. Harper, let me show you these chest films. We were able to relieve the obstruction of his chest tube, so the buildup of fluid you see should resolve itself soon. (Mrs. Harper looks lost) Which translates as he should be home in no time."

"Mrs. Harper: He was making waffles."

"Meredith: Ok, in that case, I'll stay where you can see me. Now we just have to drill a hole and try to find the spot that controls the motor function."

"Bailey: She can't afford to lose this much blood. We need more blood."

"Derek: Get me some suction here. I can't see what I'm doing. Clamp, clamp, clamp, please. Is there any blood in the rapid infuser?"

"Nurse: We're waiting on two units."

"Derek: What do you mean, waiting?"

"Bailey: Well, we didn't anticipate this much blood loss."

"Derek: What did you cut?"

"Bailey: Nothing. It just blew. She came in with too much damage. The artery walls are too weak."

"MVO: We can't pretend we haven't been told. We've all heard the proverbs, heard the philosophers, heard our grandparents warning us about wasted time, heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day. Still, sometime we have to see for ourselves."

""
"Burke: I'm not doing you any more favors. This was it."

"Cristina: (Scoffing) I've been holding up 50 pounds of tumor for the past 12 hours. My back's going to need traction, and the patient died anyways. And you think you did me a favor?"

"MVO: I mean, if life's so hard already, why do we bring more trouble down on ourselves? What's up with the need to hit the self-destruct button?"

"Meredith: No, caffeine just hasn't kicked in yet. If you're at all religious, you would want to start praying it kicks in soon. There's a consult in the pit. Girl with a fever and abdominal pain. After that, Nicholas in 3311 needs his meds. Mr. Moeller's IV fell out, and he's a hard stick. Postops in 1337, 3342, 3363, and 2381."

"Mr. Rice: She's been weak ever since and she's lost weight."
""
"Claire: Barely."

"Mr. Rice: And this morning, she passed out in the shower."

"Meredith: When was the trip?"
""
"Claire: A couple weeks ago. I'm really fine. I just have a fever."
""
"Meredith: Ok, well, will you lie back for an exam for me?"
""
"Claire: No, please, I don't need an exam. Just give me some antibiotics and send me home."
""
"Meredith: Well, maybe it is just a fever, but they called down for a surgeon, so I have to give the ok to let you go. So just let me do the exam."
""
"Mr. Rice: Do the exam."
""
"Claire: No. This is crazy. I'm fine."
""
"Mrs. Rice: For God's sake, Claire, I don't want to spend my entire day here."

"Meredith: You know, actually, Mrs. Rice, this might be easier if we had some privacy. So would you two mind leaving the room?"

"Mr. Rice: That's fine."

"Digby: Yeah."

"Alex: Sit, Mr..."

"Digby: Yeah. My buddy shot me."

"Cristina: Buddy?"

"Cristina: On purpose?"

"Digby: I like the scars."

""
"Digby: Look, everyone in town has tats, but my art is about commitment."
""
"Alex: So, this is your art, huh?"
""
"Digby: Damn straight."
""
"Cristina: Damn stupid. The bullet went all the way through."
""
"Digby: Bounced off my ribs. I have another one still in my shoulder. Nice, huh?"
""
"Cristina: (Sarcastically) You could hang it in the Louvre."

"Digby: I have an ethos. Why do anything unless you're willing to go one step further than anybody else?"
""
"Alex: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."

"Digby: Exactly. And pain is the great divide. My coach used to say, it's all about how we process pain."

"Alex: Football?"

"Digby: Wrestling, Iowa State."

"Alex: Iowa, 141."

"(She lifts her shirt to reveal pink scars)"

"Meredith: Where did you get these? Claire...you've had surgery recently. These scars are still pink."

"Claire: Don't tell my parents."

"George: Ahh. And you noticed her foot twitching? Come on, Jamie."
""
"Jamie: My foot."

"George: Oh, yeah. About three months ago?"

"Mrs. Hayes: Just a little. We took her to County Hospital and she got the CT scan, which showed her..."
""
"George: Brain abnormality. Here, you can put it...And the twitching has gotten worse?"
""
"Mr. Hayes: A lot worse. They just don't have the proper equipment back home to figure out what's wrong."

"Jamie: Show Mommy."

"George: Yes, your mommy."

"Jamie: Show Mommy and Daddy."

"(Cristina walks away looking very sick)"

"Meredith: I think she had some sort of illegal surgery done in Mexico."

"Bailey: Botched abortion?"
""
"Meredith: No! She has four laparoscopic scars on her abdomen and won't say what they're from, the parents are clueless."
""
"Bailey: She's a minor."

"Meredith: Seventeen. Freshman in college."
""
"Bailey: You order up for a CT?"
""
"Meredith: Yes."
""
"Bailey: So while she's there, the nurses couldn't get a Foley on Mr. Garay. He may need a Coude cath if you can't get a normal one in there. Write up postop notes on all surgical-floor patients that had surgery within the last 24 hours. Be sure to document their EKG's and x-rays. Hunt them down if you can't find them."

"George: Hey, hey, hey. Have you seen Shepherd?"
""
"Izzie: Not as up close as Meredith has."
""
"George: What? Are you trying to get her in trouble? She's our friend."
""
"Izzie: George, this program will make or break our careers. Some of us will make it through, and some of us won't. And that decision depends entirely on recommendations from doctors like Shepherd. There is a reason we don't sleep with the attendings."
""
"George: It's not her fault, ok. It's Shepherd's. He's the attending, he should know better. He's taking advantage of her."
""
"Izzie: It didn't exactly sound like anything was happening against her will last night."

"Bailey: Is this girl fat?"

"Meredith: Not at all. She's a normal college kid."

"Bailey: So, what do you see?"
""
"Meredith: Her stomach's stapled. She's had a gastric bypass."
""
"Bailey: And a bad one, at that."
""
"(Bailey and Meredith in the hall talking to Mr. And Mrs. Rice.)"
""
"Meredith: Gastric bypass is a procedure normally done on obese patients to help them lose weight."
""
"Mr. Rice: Claire? She doesn't need to lose weight."
""
"Mrs. Rice: Are you kidding? This means the world to her. (To Meredith and Bailey) But it is so typical of this girl to take the easy way out. She's done it with everything since she was a little kid."
""
"Bailey: Mrs. Rice, nothing about this is gonna be easy. She's gonna face a lifelong struggle with malnutrition unless she has surgery to reverse the procedure."
""
"Mrs. Rice: Do the surgery. (To Mr. Rice) I told her to watch the freshman 15. Don't eat junk, exercise. But when she came home Christmas, who had to take her out and buy her a brand new pair of size 6 jeans because she couldn't get in the ones I got her last summer?"
""
"Mr. Rice: Tina, you know, she tries so hard. She does. She gets good grades. She gets A's."
""
"Mrs. Rice: She has illegal surgery in Mexico."
""
"Bailey: Unfortunately, there were complications with the bypass."
""
"Mr. Rice: What do you mean?"
""
"Bailey: She has what looks like an abscess under her diaphragm, and edema, which is a swelling of the bowel wall. I can't say for certain she'll recover completely."
""
"Mr. Rice: Just do whatever you have to do to make her well, ok?"
""

"Jamie: And nose?"
""
"Derek: We're gonna find out what's causing these seizures. Does MRI know we're coming down?"

""
"Nurse: Diazepam, IV."
""
"Derek: Tourniquet please. Jaime, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna put this on your arm, ok? Isn't that fun? Here, we're gonna put that right there, like that. And this is gonna feel cold.

"Woman: Perfect, this is just perfect. I was hoping to be in Portland right now."

"Woman: Funny?"
""
"JP: Romantic?"

"Woman: Like the therapist thing was funny and romantic?"
""
"JP: That was funny."
""
"Woman: No, that was sad. He called my therapist pretending to be his therapist, to find out what I'd said about him."
""
"Izzie: That's a little passive-aggressive, JP?"
""
"Woman: A little? He is the king of passive-aggressive. And he's manipulative...and needy..."

"Burke: Very safe, compared to your hobby. Getting shot is a little more risky."
""
"Alex: That's kind of the point."
""
"Burke: He's running a fever."
""
"Alex: Due to the extra stress on his body from the gunshot."
""
"Burke: Digby, the impact of the bullet on your chest fractured a rib and caused a hemopneumothorax."
""
"Digby: That sucks, I guess."

"(Claire's mom enters her room angrily)"
""
"Claire: Before you guys start, I know you're mad."
""
"Mrs. Rice: Disbelief, Claire, just disbelief."
""
"Mr. Rice: I'm just concerned. Where did you get the idea to do this?"
""
"Claire: The internet."
""
"Mrs. Rice: But, honey, there is a healthy way to lose weight."
""
"Claire: Yeah, I tried that, but...it doesn't work for me like it does for you."
""
"Mr. Rice: Hey, you don't need to lose weight."
""
"Mrs. Rice: What are you eating? And how much have you been working out? I mean, you know, most of the time, when people hit their target weight, they have to work to stay there."
""
"(Meredith is looking on)"
""
"Claire: Everyone gains weight in college, Mom. It's...it's stressful. There's...there's not enough time for exercise. I just thought if I wasn't worried about my diet, then...I could focus more on my studies."
""
"Mrs. Rice: So you took yet another shortcut? Life doesn't work that way, Claire."
""
"Mr. Rice: Tina!"
""
"Mrs. Rice: What? You want to argue this?"
""
"(He shuts up)"
""
"Mrs. Rice: (To Meredith) She has so much potential id she would just apply herself..."
""
"Meredith: Ok. Ok, I think we should focus on taking care of your daughter. And, Claire, your parents agree, the best thing to do is to reverse the bypass."
""
"Claire: No! No, it's my body. I do not want surgery again. Please?"
""
"Meredith: There were serious complications. And this is about your health."
""
"Claire: But I'd rather be thin."
""
"Mrs. Rice: Well, I'm afraid the choice isn't up to you."
""
""
"(Jamie is in CT scan and Derek and her parents are looking at the results)"
""
"Derek: It's called Rasmussen's encephalitis. What it amounts to is that this side of her brain... (Points to screen) This part's all healthy, working perfectly. This black part of the brain, this...all of that is dead, or dying. The condition has gotten radically worse since her CT scans three months ago. Left untreated, the disease is gonna kill her."
""
"Mrs. Hayes: How soon?"
""
"Derek: Too soon."
""
"Mr. Hayes: So is there a cure?"
""
"Derek: The treatment requires the diseased portion of her brain be removed and sealed off. See, eventually, the spinal fluid will fill the cavity."
""
"Mr. Hayes: R-Remove? But, I mean, that's..."
""
"Derek: Half her brain, yes."
""
"Mrs. Hayes: Half her brain. That...seems impossible."
""
"Derek: Her age makes it possible. Her brain's not fully developed, so the remaining neurons will compensate for the loss."
""
"(Mrs. Hayes runs out, George follows)"
""
"Mr. Hayes: But will she be normal?"
""
"(Derek and Mr. Hayes walk out. Jamie is on a gurney in the hall.)"
""
"Derek: There are risks to any surgery. And this is, you know, a major one. But if we're successful, Jamie could walk out of this hospital in a couple weeks, go on to live a relatively normal life. Look, I know this is a lot to digest. The important thing to remember is that we can save her life."
""
"Mrs. Hayes: Thank you."
""
"(Mr. and Mrs. Hayes go with Jamie)"
""
"Derek: Dr. O'Malley?"
""
"George: Yes? What? (Sounds irritated)"
""
"Derek: I'm sorry to bother you but if the parents consent I thought you'd like to scrub in on the hemispherectomy. Are you in, or not?"
""
"George: Uh, in."
""
"Derek: Good."
""
""
"(Meredith is standing in hallway eating a cookie and looking nauseous.)"
""
"George: Yang. I'm scrubbing in on a hemispherectomy with Shepherd."
""
"Cristina: Get out! I would kill for that."
""
"George: We're gonna cut out half a girl's brain and it's going to work. It's"
"outrageous. Almost makes it hard to hate him."
""
"Cristina: Why do you hate him?"
""
"George: Oh, no reason."
""
"Cristina: You know about him and Meredith?"
""
"George: You know?"
""
"Cristina: When are you gonna figure out that I know everything?"
""
"(Izzie walks up stairs)"
""
"George (To Izzie) She knows."
""
"Izzie: What, about doctor-cest?"
""
"Cristina: It's been going on for, like ever."
""
"Izzie: Seriously?"
""
"George: And you didn't tell us?"
""
"Cristina: Ooh, you're a gossip, huh?"
""
"George: I am not!"
""
"Izzie: I am."
""
"(Arrive at hospital coffee shop)"
""
"George: He's about to go into major brain surgery on no sleep? Not very responsible."
""
"Cristina: Jealous much? Sex all night isn't about being responsible."
""
"Izzie: No, it's about sex all night. I can't believe you're not more pissed off about this, you of all people."
""
"Cristina: Well, she works hard all day. She's good at her job. Why should you care how she unwinds? I mean, you like to bake all night. Some people like to drink. Others like an occasional screaming orgasm."
""
"(Alex walks up)"
""
"Alex: Yeah, we do. Forget I said that. Pretend like I'm not here. Continue. (To Cristina) You look like you need to be spoon-fed."
""
"Cristina: You look like Alex."
""
"George: Yeah, about drinking, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist... (Nods to where Dr. Taylor is standing nearby)Do you think he drinks?"
""
"Cristina: I said, whatever gets you through the day."
""
"George: I mean here, at work. Earlier, I thought I smelled...Do you think...? I mean, his patients trust that...So I should say something, right?"
""
"Alex: It's a can of worms, George. Weren't we talking about sex, anyway?"
""
"George: Doofus."

"(Burke in a trauma room, working on Digby)"

"Digby: This is gonna leave a pretty sexy scar, huh?"

"Burke: Don't get any more crazy ideas."

"(Alex takes a Polaroid picture.)"
""
"Digby: You really think my ideas are crazy?"
""
"Burke: I'm leaning that way."
""
"Alex: We wrestle, he plays trumpet."
""
"Digby: Hey, I feel pretty dizzy."
""
"Burke: You've lost some blood."

"Digby: This, too, shall pass. Hey... How come I don't see you down at the Mat in Belltown?"

"Alex: Oh, man, no time."

"Digby: Bro, make time. I'll be expecting you."

"(Bailey and Meredith operating on Claire)"
""
"Bailey: Handle with care. This thing's... (Hands her bowel)"
""
"Meredith: Full of gunk. I know."
""
"Bailey: We need to free the bowel from the adhesions caused from the abscess. This poor girl. What was she thinking?"
""
"Meredith: She wants her mother's approval. She wanted to please her."
""
"Bailey: And this damage is the result? Here, resect that."
""
"Meredith: Needle-tip Bovie, please. (Hands bowel back to Bailey)"
""
"Bailey: When you're done here, you have postops waiting."
""
"Meredith: I know, Dr. Bailey."
""
"Bailey: Cristina's got the flu. So, you need to pick up the slack in clinic."
""
"Meredith: Look, I'll mop the floors, ok? (Bailey glares at her) Sorry, that was inappropriate."
""
"Bailey: It's not the only thing that's inappropriate. While we're on the subject, you care to tell me what you think you're doing?"
""
"Meredith: Look, I'll jump through hoops if you want me to. But what I do what I leave this hospital is my business."
""
"Bailey: Half this hospital knows your business. Flu isn't the only virus spreading around here."
""
"Meredith: I made a choice, and I know you don't respect me for that choice. But I'll live with the consequences."
""
"Bailey: Then I'll have lots of hoops for you to jump through."
""
"Meredith: I've done everything you've asked me to do. I may not do it your way but it gets done. So whatever else you got, bring it on."
""
"(Claire's bowel burst, spraying Meredith with toxic waste)"

"(People in gallery are laughing and saying ""Ew"")"

"Bailey: Ok, Dr. Grey, now that you've drained the organ, we can attempt to repair it."

"Meredith: Now my day is perfect."

"George: I appreciate this. The chance to scrub in on this kind of procedure is, well...Yeah, I appreciate it."
""
"Nurse: Here you go. Triple espresso, not too hot."
""
"Derek: Oh, I love you, seriously."
""
"Dr. Taylor: Ah, coffee, where would medicine be without it, huh?"
""
"Derek: I hope you have a new crossword, Taylor. We're gonna be here a while."
""
"Dr. Taylor: (Pointing to crossword in his pocket) Never go without. Big day for you, kid. Congrats."
""
"George: Thanks."
""
"Derek: (To Jamie) Hey, princess. You ready to take a nap?"

"Dr. Taylor: Hey, look what I got."

"Derek: Blow bubbles, that's it. Just breathe in. Oh, that's it."

"Derek: (To George) What?"
""
"George: Do you smell...?"
""
"Derek: Smell what? I have a mask."
""
"George: Uh...I'm sorry, Dr. Taylor, but did you just...? Have you been drinking?"
""
"Dr. Taylor? I beg your pardon?"
""
"Derek: What?"
""
"George: Do you smell...I...I smell alcohol."
""
"Dr. Taylor: Where the hell do you get off accusing me of something like that?"
""
"Derek: George, you're out of line."
""
"George: There are rules. You know, there are rules for a reason. You just...There is a 2-year-old girl on this table. You shouldn't take advantage of someone else's vulnerability."
""
"Dr. Taylor: Look, I don't need some punk intern telling me what's at stake here. Get him out of here, Shep.(George and Dr. Taylor look at Derek) Shep?"

"Derek: You're out, George."

"(Izzie retrieving keys from JP's throat)"
""
"Woman: Do you really, seriously want to know why I'm leaving?! Seriously? How about when you started insisting that I quit my job, right when I started to make more money than you? That should have been the last straw. No, no. The last straw should have been when I found out that those mysterious phone calls that you've been getting that you kept denying were from other women were really coming from your mother. This isn't healthy."
""
"Izzie: Just, hold still, please."
""
"Woman: Don't you dare try to patch this up!"
""
"Izzie: Could the both of you please stop?"
""
"Woman: You don't love me, JP. You love to smother me. And if I could just get you to admit that, then I could leave you with an ounce of respect."
""
"Izzie: Athena, I let you stay in here to keep him calm. So, if you're just gonna keep..."
""
"Athena: Check that. I can't respect a man desperate enough to swallow my exit strategy. That is the last straw!"
""
"Izzie: Michelle, can you get her out of here?"
""
"Michelle: Ma'am?"

"Athena: Fine!"
""
"Michelle: C'mon."

"Izzie: Please! Please, just shut up!"

"Athena: Breathe, JP. Just breathe."

"Izzie: Yeah, he'll be fine."

"Athena: You lit...you did that on purpose, didn't you?"

"Izzie: Can I offer you some advice? Get in your car and go, for all of our sakes."

"JP: You never gonna find where I parked it."

"(She grabs the keys and leaves.)"
""
""
"(Meredith and Bailey are walking through the hall)"
""
"Meredith: I need a shower."
""
"Bailey: I need a shower. You need to go tell that girl's parents what kind of kid they're getting back."
""
"Meredith: You're not gonna let me shower first?"

"Bailey: That would be a hoop, would it not?"

"Meredith: It would qualify."

"Bailey: Shower first, then."

"(Meredith enters locker room, Izzie and Cristina are inside.)"

"Izzie: That makes me strangely happy."
""
"Cristina: Oh, God. Oh, Meredith, you smell like..."

"Izzie: Karma."

"Izzie: Nothing."

"Cristina: Something vile is stuck in your hair. You know, just go stand over there, please."

"Meredith: Ugh, how much do I love being a surgeon right now?"

"Izzie: Karma."
""
"Meredith: What does karma have to do with anything?"
""
"Izzie: I'm just saying, you've been given all the best surgeries. And now you smell like putrid goo. And you're giving off a stench. Karma's a bitch."

"Bailey: (Entering locker room) Dr. Shepherd needs an intern in surgery. Which one of you is clear?"
""
"Cristina: I'm good, Dr. Bailey, where do you want me?"

"Bailey: You need to lie down somewhere."

"Cristina: I'm fine, I'm completely healthy."

"(Burke at desk, Alex enters)"
""
"Alex: Doctor. Digby's postop CBC shows a severe spike in the white blood cell count."
""
"Burke: What is it?"
""
"Alex: It's 27, with 16 percent bands."
""
"Burke: Something else is wrong. That's a little high for simple stress. Check for any other possible sources of infection or recent illness."
""
""
"(Derek on Jamie's OR)"
""
"Derek: All right, we're gonna start the procedure with the left temporal lobectomy. Thanks for joining us, Dr. Yang. After the temporal, we'll do the frontal, and then the occipital."

"(Meredith walking through the hall with Mr. and Mrs. Rice.)"
""
"Meredith: We were able to reverse the gastric bypass, but we did lose a significant portion of her bowel. And because of the short gut syndrome, Claire will never eat normally again."
""
"Mr. Rice: Ok, wait, do...? How do we help her here?"
""
"Meredith: Well, getting proper nutrition will be a lifelong problem for Claire."
""
"Mrs. Rice: Great, as if we already don't have our hands full with her."
""
"Meredith: She gets good grades. She stays out of trouble. She's smart. I just think she feels like nothing she does is good enough for you."
""
"Mrs. Rice: If you somehow think that I'm responsible for this..."
""
"Meredith: I think Claire is killing herself to please you."
""
"Mrs. Rice: Oh, please. You have no idea what's going on in that girl's mind."
""
"Meredith: You're her mother. She worships the ground you walk on. She didn't do this for herself."

"Mrs. Rice: I think that this situation is completely..."

"Mr. Rice: Tina...Shut up."

"(Meredith and Mrs. Rice look shocked as Mr. Rice walks away)"

"Digby: I'm freezing, doc. I-I cant stop shaking."

"Alex: All right, Digby, have you had any recent illnesses, new piercings, tattoos, wounds?"
""
"Digby: New tat on my calf."

"(Alex flips back blanket to reveal an extremely infected tattoo of a spider on his calf)"

"Alex: Ew."

"Digby: Oh, my God. It was nowhere near that nasty this morning."
""
"Alex: But it was infected? Why didn't you say anything?"
""
"Digby: Ah, it was nothing. I'm not here to complain about a little pain."
""
"Alex: The infection's been exacerbated by the stress on your body from the gunshot. (To Olivia) Get him to ICU. We'll get you started on some antibiotics."
""
""
"(Jamie's OR)"
""
"Derek: From the frontal lobectomy, I'm going to encounter a, uh..."
""
"(Jamie although sedated is blinking)"
""
"Cristina: We'll encounter the anterior cerebral artery."
""
"Derek: Yes, so we're gonna need to, uh..."
""
"(Jamie blinks again)"
""
"Cristina: The branches of the artery need to be coagulated and divided."
""
"Derek: You know, Taylor, her anesthesia's awful light. (No response from Taylor, Jamie still blinking) Come on, Taylor, s-she's waking up."
""
"Cristina: Dr. Taylor? Uh, he's asleep!"

"Steph: Yes, doctor."

""
"(Burke running through hallway, Alex is working on Digby)"
""
"Burke: What happened?"
""
"Alex: He went into multi-system organ failure, secondary to overwhelming sepsis. Now he's all..."
""
"Burke: Fix his BP, that should help his mental status."
""
"Alex: He's maxed out on pressors. We got V-tach."
""
"Burke: He's looking bad. Put the defib pads on him and give him 150 of amnioterone."

"Alex: I lost his pulse."
""
"Burke: Defib! Get the pads! Give me the paddles and charge to 200. Clear. (Shocks Digby) Again at 300. Clear. (Shocks again)"

"Derek: This packing, we hope, will prevent hemorrhaging. Dr. Yang, do you want to add something to that?"

"Cristina: It will allow the cerebral spinal fluid to eventually fill the cavity."

"Derek: Hmm, very nice."

"Derek: You two, you wanna close up?"

"Doctor: Yes, doctor."

"Derek: I'm gonna go to bed."

"(Derek points to gallery and motions George to come outside)"
""
"Derek: Let me explain."
""
"George: It's fine."
""
"Derek: No, there is a code among doctors. We're not supposed to ask each other questions, not within the walls of this hospital."
""
"George: Ok, I was out of line."
""
"Derek: No, you weren't. I was. I was out of line. Somebody should have taken responsibility. It should have been the guy doing the cutting. It should have been me. You didn't deserve what happened to you today. You did the right thing code or no code."

"Izzie: Yeah, well, I'm not. If you wait a few minutes, you can have a piece of cake. Baked it chock-full of love. Actually, chock-full of unrelenting, all consuming rage and hostility, but it's still tasty."

"Meredith: So you know?"
""
"Izzie: I know."
""
"Meredith: Well, do you want the long, sordid version, or do you want the short version, where I started sleeping with a guy who turned out to be my boss?"
""
"Izzie: Neither."

"Meredith: Izzie, cut me some slack here."
""
"Izzie: No. You want to Dartmouth. Your mother is Ellis Grey. You grew up... Look at his house! You know, you walk into the OR, and there isn't anyone who doubts that you should be there. I grew up in a trailer park. I went to state school. I put myself through med school by posing in my underwear. You know, I walk into the OR, and everyone hopes I'm the nurse. Y-you have their respect without even trying, and you're throwing it away for...what? A few good surgeries?"
""
"Meredith: No. It's not about the surgeries. It's not about getting ahead."

"Meredith: See? Even they thing it's weird."
""
"MVO: But the thing is, it's hard to let go of that fairy tale entirely. Cause almost everyone still has that smallest bit of hope, of faith, that one day they'll open their eyes and it will all come true."
""
"(Derek and Meredith smile at each other)"
""
""
"(Cristina in an office)"
""
"Woman: So I've checked the schedule."
""
"Cristina: I start ENT on the 9th. It's a light rotation. Can you get me in then?"
""
"Woman: Oh, I'm afraid not. We have openings on the 16th. There are other"
"options besides termination, you know? Adoption, keeping the baby. You think it over. Call me back. I'm here..."
""
"Cristina: Put me down for the 16th. I'll confirm after I rearrange my schedule."
""
"Woman: I know this is a difficult decision."
""
"Cristina: You know the talking part?"
""
"Woman: Mm."
""
"Cristina: I'm not interested."
""
""
"(Alex examining a female patient)"
""
"Alex: So, Devo, you just had a root canal, correct?"
""
"Devo: Yeah. I couldn't stop bleeding after, literally. Now I'm stuck with you guys."
""
"(Burke enters)"
""
"Burke: Give me the bullet."
""
"Alex: 17-year-old female hospitalized for excessive bleeding, status post root canal. Also had a significant new heart murmur associated with fever. Now afebrile on antibiotics."
""
"Devo: If I'm gonna die, can you page my mom and dad?"
""
"Burke: You're not dying. Where are your parents?"
""
"Devo: In the cafeteria. My freak father likes hospital food."
""
"Burke: You're in excellent hands here. Dr. Karev is gonna run some labs. And I'll see you with your parents in a little while. Add a bleeding time to the coags."
""
"(Burke leaves)"
""
"Alex: So, what kind of name is Devo, anyway?"
""
"Devo: 80's rocker. My parents did too much blow. I call myself Esther."
""
"Alex: Nice skirt. What are you, Amish?"
""
"Devo: Get a life. Haven't you ever seen an Orthodox Jew?"
""
""
"(Meredith and Cristina examining x-rays)"
""
"Cristina: This guy belongs in Psych. What are you doing turfing him here?"
""
"Psych Doctor: He's my gift to you. Had a seizure two days ago and another one this morning."
""
"Meredith: What are you talking about? It says right here, ""He talks to dead people, his family things he's dangerous. They had him committed."" That's Psych, not Neuro."
""
"Cristina: Man, didn't you go to med school?"
""
"Psych Doctor: Yes, and unlike the correspondence school you attended..."
""
"Cristina: Oh, that would be Stanford, right?"
""
"Psych Doctor: I learned not to jump to conclusions. Sorry, ladies. We can't take him back until he's cleared."
""
"Cristina: So, you're dumping him on us?"
""
"Psych Doctor: He thinks his seizures are visions."
""
"Patient: Hello! They're not seizures. I'm psychic."
""
"Cristina: Of course you are, and I'm a chicken. (To Psych Doctor) Hey, genius."
""
"Meredith: Ok, Mr. Duff. We're gonna start our workup now."
""
"Mr. Duff: Work me up, work me down, I'm telling you it's a waste of time."
""
"Cristina: Ok, well, humor us. Can you grip my fingers, please?"
""
"(He appears to go into a trance.)"
""
"Meredith: Cristina."
""
"Cristina: Mr. Duff?"
""
"Meredith: Mr. Duff, are you ok?"
""
"Mr. Duff: Someone..."
""
"Meredith: Someone what?"
""
"Mr. Duff: Someone's gonna check out. Bye-bye."
""
"Cristina: Oh, man, he's nuts."
""
"Mr. Duff: I'm dizzy, not deaf, lady. And I'm telling you, someone on the fourth floor is gonna die."
""
"Man on PA System: Code blue, fourth floor. Code blue, fourth floor."
""
"(Code team goes running by in the hallway)"
""
"(Meredith and Cristina leave looking bewildered.)"
""
""
"(Cristina walking through the hallway, still looking ill.)"
""
"George: Fourth floor, dead guy. The psychic predicted the fourth floor dead guy."
""
"Cristina: I need someone to cover me on the 16th. You in?"
""
"(Meredith and Derek walk by)"
""
"George: I'm thinking about letting my hair grow. And maybe I won't shave. Go for the stubble effect. What do you think?"
""
"Cristina: The 16th, George. Can you cover me or not?"
""
"George: Uh, yeah. I guess. Why?"
""
"Cristina: It's none of your business."
""
"George: Thank you would be nice."
""
""
"(Cut to Meredith and Derek still walking through the halls)"
""
"Meredith: It's just that I hardly know anything about you."
""
"Derek: You know I'm from New York. You know I like ferry boats."
""
"Meredith: Enough with the ferry boats. What about your friends?"
""
"Derek: I'm a surgeon. I don't have friends."
""
"Meredith: Everybody has friends. I mean, who do you hang out with? What do you do on your days off? These are important questions."
""
"Derek: Ah, important for who?"
""
"Meredith: We're having sex every night. I think I deserve details."
""
"Derek: You have more details than most."
""
"Meredith: See, this is going somewhere weird. I want facts, and until I get them, my pants are staying on."
""
"Derek: Or you could just roll with it. Be flexible. See what happens."
""
"Meredith: I'm not flexible."
""
"Derek: (Laughing) There I disagree. Hmm. I've got to go. We'll find these things out. That's the fun part. You know? That's the gravy."
""
"Meredith: That is what I'm talking about. I don't want to be your gravy."
""
""
"(Burke and Alex in the waiting area talking with Devo's parents.)"
""
"Burke: Your daughter needs a valve replacement. Tests are indicative of Von Willebrand's disease, which explains excessive bleeding after the root canal."
""
"Man: And that means?"
""
"Alex: Devo can't take the blood thinners necessary to maintain a mechanical heart valve."
""
"Burke: We're suggesting a porcine valve instead."
""
"Man: Porcine? As in pig?"
""
"Burke: It's the standard of care for someone in this situation."
""
"Man: Pig, huh?"
""
"Alex: It's the other white meat."
""
"Woman: I don't care what you have to do. Save my daughter's life."
""
""
"(Bailey performing surgery on a woman in the OR)"
""
"Bailey: I'm removing the lump now."
""
"Woman: Someone said you guys have a psychic running around here. Is that true?"
""
"Bailey: I did not even hear you say that."
""
"Woman: Predicted someone would die on the fourth floor."
""
"Izzie: ICU's on the fourth floor. People die all the time."
""
"Bailey: Ok. We're finishing up here, Mrs. Glass. We'll take this down to Path and get the results of the frozen-section biopsy and see you in a few hours."
""
"Izzie: Seriously, the guy is just playing mind games. I can see further into the future than he can."
""
"Bailey: Why do you even care about this, Stevens?"
""
"Izzie: I don't."
""
""
"(Derek examining patient in the ER)"
""
"Derek: Ok, Mr. Walker. Does that hurt?"
""
"Mr. Walker: I can't feel anything until you get to my thigh."
""
"Derek: Try wiggling your toes."
""
"(Toes do not move)"
""
"Mr. Walker: Are they moving?"
""
"Derek: No."
""
"Mr. Walker: Damn. I could about ten minutes ago."
""
"Derek: Well, your spine x-rays look clear. You fell rock climbing?"
""
"Mr. Walker: In Snohomish. Just a small drop. I was belayed. My wife and boys are on the way. What's wrong with me, anyway?"
""
"Derek: Hold your legs up"
""
"(Lifts the mans legs, lets go and they drop)"
""
"Mr. Walker: Should I be scared now?"
""
"Derek: Just try and relax. Nurse, I need a stat MRI. Send an intern with him. Make it Meredith Grey."
""
"Nurse: Mm-hmm."
""
""
"(George and Alex in an exam room with a patient, Burke is walking by)"
""
"Alex: Ew. Thick, short neck. That isn't good. It's hard to intubate. You want me to do that?"
""
"George: He's my patient. I'm fine. I just can't see anything yet. Suction."
""
"Alex: Don't break any teeth."
""
"George: I know that...don't you think I know that?"
""
"Alex: Pulse ox down 87 percent."
""
"George: Bag him."
""
"Alex: Are you sure you don't want me to do that?"
""
"George: No, damn it! Tube. (Puts tube in forcefully) There. Huh. Got it."
""
"(Alex listens to the lungs)"
""
"Alex: It's in the esophagus. Don't you know an esophagus from a trachea?"
""
"George: Damn it. Anatomy is all messed up in here."
""
"(Burke enters)"
""
"Burke: Are you trying to kill this patient, O'Malley? Maybe we should send you back to practice on mannequins."
""
"George: No, it's just I haven't done his much. But when I have, it's...it's been good. It's just I-I haven't..."
""
"Burke: Let's review the concepts. Never take your eyes away. Always, always know you can follow through."
""
"Alex: Don't ever follow through on one of my patients, O'Malley."
""
"(Alex and Burke leave, George looks frustrated.)"
""
""
"(Cristina is in the Mr. Duff's room)"
""
"Mr. Duff: A little Botox would do wonders on those frown lines."
""
"Cristina: Ok. Shut up."
""
"Mr. Duff: Are you allowed to talk to me like that? (Cristina hisses at him) God, you're hot...in a Mrs. Livingston kind of way."
""
"Cristina: See here? (Shows him papers) These are spikes in your temporal lobe. It means you have epilepsy. Not visions. Seizures."
""
"Mr. Duff: You think I'm epileptic? That is no not right."
""
"Cristina: I'm gonna order an MRI so I can take a closer look at your brain."
""
"Mr. Duff: Yeah, there's no way... (Starts having a ""vision"")"
""
"Cristina: Mr. Duff? Mr. Duff, can you see me? Can you hear me? Stay with me."
""
"Mr. Duff: I wouldn't have picked you for the mommy track, Nurse Betty."
""
"(Cristina stares at him)"
""
"Mr. Duff: See? I told you I know things. This pregnancy thing, you can't run away from it."
""
""
"(Cristina leaves quickly and takes the elevator to the lounge where Bailey and Izzie are.)"
""
"Cristina: Dr. Bailey, I want off the psychic case. I'll take whatever you got. Can I switch?"
""
"Bailey: Ask nicely."
""
"Cristina: Uh, well, this is me doing nicely."
""
"(Bailey stops what she is doing and glares at Cristina)"
""
"Izzie: Look, I know the type. These guys just want everybody to think they're a slideshow. Let me take him."
""
"Bailey: I don't do switches."
""
"Cristina: I'll do your post-op notes for a month."
""
"Bailey: Fine. I can accept that. Izzie, you get Psych guy. Yang. This is your lucky day. You get to be with me on the breast cancer. And there's spotting. So you'll need to do a pelvic. She's pregnant."
""
""
"(Meredith and Derek looking at Mr. Walker's scans)"
""
"Meredith: See, this. The guy's films are clear. There's no reason I can see for his creeping paralysis."
""
"Derek: It's just so surprising. I expected an intrusion into the spinal space or bony spur in the nucleus pulposus."
""
"Meredith: Well, you were wrong. You don't always get what you expect, do you?"
""
"Derek: What is your problem?"
""
"Meredith: Give me something to go on. Anything. What are your grandparents' names?"
""
"Derek: I don't have grandparents."
""
"Meredith: Whered you grow up? What's your favorite flavor of ice cream? Where'd you spend your summer vacations?"
""
"Derek: Lighten up. It'll be good for your blood pressure. (Leaves the room)"
""
"Meredith: Oh, don't you tell me to lighten up. I'll lighten up when I...feel light."
""
""
"(Cristina and Bailey in the breast cancer patient's room, talking with her and her husband)"
""
"Husband: Don't we have treatment options? I-I mean, aren't there always alternatives?"
""
"Cristina: With this stage of invasive carcinoma, surgery, chemo, radiation and drug therapy are your only options."
""
"Woman: Can I wait until the end of my pregnancy?"
""
"Cristina: The pregnancy hormones will likely speed the growth of the cancer."
""
"Husband: And the baby? Cristina: Oh, none of these courses of treatment will allow the baby to survive."
""
"Bailey: Mr. and Mrs. Glass, I understand how difficult this is."
""
"Mrs. Glass: No disrespect, but like hell, you do."
""
"Bailey: You're going to have to make a decision as to how you want to proceed."
""
"Mrs. Glass: You mean my baby's life or my own? Bailey: Yes. (They are shaken) We'll have to evacuate the fetus."
""
"(Derek is speaking with Mr. Walker, Meredith enters)"
""
"Derek: Any changes, Mr. Walker?"
""
"Mr. Walker: I can't move my legs at all now."
""
"Mrs. Walker: He said he was moving his legs when he came in. What's wrong with him?"
""
"Derek: I don't know. The paralysis is moving very quickly and there was nothing in the MRI to explain it."
""
"Meredith: Has Tommy been under any stress lately?"
""
"Mr. Walker: You know what's making me stressed? Is being in here and not being able to move."
""
"Derek: Dr. Grey."
""
"Meredith: Emotional trauma can be converted into something physical, right?"
""
"Derek: Yes, it's possible."
""
"Meredith: Like hysterical numbness or paralysis. Maybe there is no physiological reason, and he's just having a conversion reaction."
""
"Derek: You think it's psychosomatic?"
""
""
"(Curtain behind them flies open)"
""
"Mr. Duff: It is not in your head, man. I believe you."
""
"Izzie: Mr. Duff, please."
""
"Derek: Who was that?"
""
"Meredith: Psych sent him down. He has visions."
""
"Mr. Walker: Is that it? Am I crazy?"
""
"Derek: No. No. I'm gonna order a higher-level MRI. We're gonna figure this out."
""
""
"(Devo's room)"
""
"Devo: You know how important this is to me!"
""
"Mother: This is about saving your life, sweetie."
""
"Devo: And you're not respecting it, or me. You're letting them put a pig, a freaking non-kosher, traif mammal, into my chest, into my heart! The very essence of my being!"
""
"Alex: It's a porcine valve, actually."
""
"Devo: I don't care what the hell it is. If you give me a pig part, I might as well be dead."
""
"Father: I told you this whole Orthodox thing was a mistake. What was so wrong with being plain old Reform like everyone else we know?"
""
"Devo: You guys don't even light candles Friday nights. You don't even know all the Passover plagues."
""
"Alex: Boils, vermin, pestilence. Even I know that."
""
"Burke: Miss Friedman, I appreciate your extreme religious convictions."
""
"Alex: Fire, hail..."
""
"Burke: But, simply put, without this procedure, you will die."
""
"Devo: You're hotshot doctors. You'll come up with something else. As long as it doesn't answer to Wilbur and say ""oink,"" I don't care what it is."
""
""
"(Izzie loading Mr. Duff into the MRI machine)"
""
"Mr. Duff: Your nostrils are flaring."
""
"Izzie: They are not."
""
"Mr. Duff: You're into me. I can tell. ""Dr. Small and Angry"" was a hot appetizer but you, doc, are a smorgasbord of lust."
""
"Izzie: Mr. Duff, you're pressing your luck."
""
"Mr. Duff: Would you press it for me?"
""
"Izzie: I hope you're not claustrophobic. You're staring at me. Stop it."
""
"Mr. Duff: I'm looking at you, sweetheart, but it's the strangest thing. I'm hungry for a chocolate cupcake."
""
"Izzie: What did you say?"
""
"Mr. Duff: A chocolate cupcake. Maybe one of those fudgey things with the white squiggle on the frosting. Could you oblige?"
""
"Izzie: What, do I still have some chocolate on my face or in my hair or something?"
""
"Mr. Duff: What are you talking about?"
""
"Izzie: You. I know the drill, so keep it up. Next you'll be reading my cards, telling me my dead uncle is in the room."
""
"Mr. Duff: Is he?"
""
"Izzie: I don't have a dead uncle. I'm watching you."
""
""
"(Cristina is at a desk, smell her sandwich and drops it, Meredith and Izzie are there, George and Alex enter)"
""
"George: If that's turkey, can I have some?"
""
"Cristina: It's soggy."
""
"Alex: If it'll kill you. Solve everything."
""
"George: I coulda gotten that intubation. I am good at intubations."
""
"Meredith: (Taking a bite of the sandwich) Why does everything in a hospital smell like a hospital?"
""
"Izzie: Don't be so hard on yourself, George. Everybody makes mistakes."
""
"George: You know, I'm good at a lot of things."
""
"Cristina: You know what, I'm gonna tell you something. Hey, George. You need to get laid. See that nurse over there? (Points to a red headed nurse) She's single. She's got red hair. Go ask her out."
""
"George: In care you forgot, I intubated an esophagus."
""
"Alex: Dude, you're tweaking. Maybe you should go see that psychic. (Alex leaves)"
""
"Izzie: Mr. Duff is not a psychic!"
""
"Cristina: I am trying to help you. Go buy her a latte and freshen up your gonads, please. (Cristina leaves)"
""
"Izzie: Shut up."
""
"George: It's not too late to call her. You know, moms like that, surprises on their birthdays. You know, it's very Hallmark. (George leaves, Izzie sits there shaking her head)"
""
""
"(Cristina in Mr. and Mrs. Glass' room)"
""
"Mrs. Glass: I'm 47, you know? I'm 47 and having a baby which is kind of a miracle and it kind of sucks, if you see what I mean. We'd actually given up on the whole kid thing about a year ago. You know, fertility treatments, acupuncture needles in my eyes. Well, not really, but it felt like it. I was like, ""Screw this. I want my life back."" Then one awesome night on the beach with a bottle of merlot..."
""
"Cristina: I should have these labs back in a couple hours."
""
"Mrs. Glass: You get it, right? My hesitation? This isn't an easy decision, I mean. I'm having a baby."
""
"Cristina: You have advanced-stage carcinoma. You're 47 years old, so statistically you have a good probability of survival. Forego treatment, chances are you won't see your baby go to kindergarten, so whose like are you interested in saving? Excuse me."
""
"(Mr. Walker in the ER)"
""
"Mr. Walker: First my legs, then my stomach. God. Doc! Doc, my hands can't move."
""
"Derek: Squeeze my fingers."
""
"Mr. Walker: I can't."
""
"Derek: Right here. No? Let me know if you feel this. (Pokes him with needle) How about that? Here? Anything here? Up here? Ok. Nothing on this side? All right. I'll be right back. Nurse, cancel the second MRI. Call down and prep OR stat."
""
"Meredith: You're operating? On what? If there was something to fix, wouldn't we have seen it?"
""
"Derek: I think the MRI missed a clot somewhere in his upper spine. I'm gonna cut him open. I'm going in."
""
"Meredith: What if you're wrong? Couldn't unnecessary spinal surgery do more damage?"
""
"Derek: If we wait any longer and this expands into his brain stem, we have a paralyzed man who can't breathe. I'm trusting my instincts. Sometimes you've got to take a chance to save a life."
""
""
"(Alex in Devo's room)"
""
"Alex: Your mitral regurge is getting worse. The valves are leakier than ever."
""
"Devo: Are you hitting on me?"
""
"Alex: If you want me to."
""
"Devo: I hear they call you Dr. Evilspawn."
""
"Alex: Well, only the people that like me."
""
"Devo: I guess that explains the lack of faith thing."
""
"Alex: You know, I kind of think of myself as a pagan, but, hey, that's just me."
""
"Devo: You know what it's like being a teenager these days? My friends spend most of their time screwing around and getting wasted. At least I have God."
""
"Alex: Well, so God wants you to die, huh?"
""
"Devo: He wants me to be passionate about what I believe in. You don't believe in anything."
""
"Alex: Well, my mother used to pray to Saint Jude for me."
""
"Devo: How appropriate. Patron saint of lost causes."
""
"Alex: Mmm."
""
""
"(Izzie walks up to Bailey in the hall)"
""
"Izzie: I did an angio on my Psych case. The MRI came out clean, but I saw a ditzel. There's something here."
""
"Bailey: Yep, you're right. There's an AVM on his left temporal lobe."
""
"Izzie: I'll schedule the OR for tonight then."
""
"Bailey: Ohh, back up, girl."
""
"Izzie: There's high risk of spontaneous hemorrhage."
""
"Bailey: The attending has to see films. We need consent forms. Believe it or not, Stevens, we have to follow protocol. Take a breath."
""
"Izzie: But if the AVM looks like it's gonna blow, we fix it, right?"
""
"Bailey: If the man needs to be fixed, we'll fix him in due time. Why are you moving so quickly? You get too involved with your patients, Izzie. Why do you make everything so personal?"
""
"Izzie: It's not personal. (Bailey glares at her) It's not."

"Meredith: You want me to start?"

"Derek: No, I'm gonna to cut here from the base of the neck to the rib cage. I want you to hit the bleeders."
""
"Meredith: I still don't think we should be doing this."
""
"Derek: This guy has a spinal hematoma."
""
"Meredith: We don't know that."
""
"Derek: Which left untreated are almost always fatal."
""
"Meredith: You're cutting blind. Whatever happened to being practical?"
""
"Derek: I need to see more here. Retractor."

"Meredith: Wow. The spine."

"Derek: There's no ""wow"" in ""practical."""

""
"Alex: Little blue love pills, lots of them."

"George: Come on."
""
"Alex: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. There it is, a bovine xenograft. (Jumps up shouting) O'Malley, you think too much. Can't you see it? You got to dance and jab. Dance and job. Like me. I am the Ali of this place."
""
""

""
"Alex: Does the wall ever bow back?"

"Devo: It's called davening, smartass. This is me communing with God, and you're interrupting."
""
"Alex: I've found a transplant option. At first, I thought maybe a cadaver, but they're really hard to find. And then I realized Dr. Burke can transplant a bovine mitral valve instead of the pig"
""
"(Burke enters just as Alex says this)"
""
"Father: She can get a cow valve?"
""
"Mother: Dr. Burke, why wasn't this mentioned before?"
""
"Burke: Dr. Karev."
""
"Alex: The bovine valve has only been an option the last few years."
""
"Burke: And it's a much more complicated procedure."
""
"Alex: But the best part is it's actually superior to the pig. It lasts longer."
""
""
"(Cut to Burke and Alex in the hallway)"
""
"Burke: What incredibly small fraction of your brain were you using in there?"
""
"Alex: What?"
""
"Burke: Correct me if I'm wrong, but did you not present an alternative procedure without consulting your attending first?"
""
"Alex: I thought you'd be..."
""
"Burke: What, impressed? That's just stupid."

"Alex: I'm sorry..."

"Burke: We're finished here, Karev. You're off this case."

"Izzie: You need to sign these consent forms so we can proceed with your surgery."
""
"Mr. Duff: Sweetheart, I'm not signing anything unless it's got my name on it followed by a whole bunch of zeros."
""
"Izzie: Look, the AVM is located in this crucial part of the brain. It's a tangle of blood vessels that could burst and affect your speech, among other things. So, we know your visions are actually seizures."
""
"Mr. Duff: Do you?"
""
"Izzie: Do I what?"
""
"Mr. Duff: Know they're seizures."
""
"Izzie: You're really good at reading people, aren't you? Telling them what they want to hear?"
""
"Mr. Duff: There's a really unfortunate alignment of Saturn in the house of Jupiter right now."
""
"Izzie: Ok, I know what you're doing. You watch people, read their body language. You say ""chocolate cupcakes,"" I lean towards you, so you think you're on the right track. Not only do you know you're having seizures, but you're milking it."
""
"Mr. Duff: Hmm. Well, we'll just see about that, cricket."
""
"Izzie: What? What did you just call me?"
""
""
"(Cristina enters Mr. and Mrs. Glass' room)"

"Cristina: Excuse me?"
""
"Mr. Glass: We've decided to keep the baby."

"Cristina: You have cancer."
""
"Mrs. Glass: Can't you tell me I'll survive if I go through with this?"
""
"Cristina: Having the procedure does not necessarily improve the treatment outcome."
""
"Mrs. Glass: You have quite the bedside manner. You know that, right? My mom died of breast cancer when she was in her 40's. I have that cancer gene. My chances are pretty much lose-lose, whichever way you look at it, except for the baby. We're keeping it."
""
"Cristina: I'll call down a Psych consult."

"Burke: I'm not in the mood, either."

"Cristina: Good. (Pause) What do you want?"
""
"Burke: Nothing. I just haven't seen you all day."

"Cristina: So I'm working."

"Burke: I've never done a bovine replacement before. I don't know what I'm doing."

"Cristina: Look it up, research it and get someone to assist you."

"Burke: It's not that easy."

"Cristina: This is a problem that has a solution, Burke. There are a lot of problems that don't."

"Meredith: Third thoracic laminae. Nothing. I think I see the dura pulsating here."
""
"Derek: No, it's not. Keep looking."
""
"Meredith: We have been at this for four hours. Maybe he just injured his spinal cord and there's nothing to fix."
""
"Derek: Grey, when you read your books, make sure you reference them correctly. Progressive paralysis implies a pressure lesion."
""
"Meredith: My books got me here..."

"Doctor: Pressure's up to 180/111. The pulse is in the 40s."

"Meredith: What is it?"

"Doctor: I'm pushing 70 milligrams Diazoxide."

"Derek: Ok. Autonomic dysreflexia."

"Derek: BP and the heart rate are unstable."

"Meredith: We're in trouble, aren't we?"
""
"Derek: We've got to find the clot."

"Meredith: I can see the cord below the dura. Is he gonna stroke out?"

"Derek: Focus, Grey. We're gonna find the clot. It's there. Cleanup, please."

"Alex: Oh, about 60 minutes by messenger."

"Burke: You're scrubbing in."

"Alex: Thank you very much, sir."

"Burke: This doesn't get you any points, Karev. I'm the only one with points around here, ok? Oh, by the way. Devo wants a rabbi to bless her before surgery."

"Alex: Seriously?"

"Meredith: What is it?"

"Derek: I think so."

"Meredith: But you don't know that."

"Meredith: But, you don't know if the paralysis he already has will be permanent."

"Derek: No."

"Meredith: You know, you keep taking everything on faith. How do you know what's real and what's not?"
""
"Derek: You just do. You know some people would call this a relationship. The kind where you exchange keys, leave your toothbrush over."

"Meredith: Who? Who would call it that?"

"Derek: Me. I would."

"Meredith: And I'm supposed to believe you?"

"Mr. Duff: Yeah, yeah. I think maybe I am."

"Izzie: What is it?"
""
"Mr. Duff: It's me. I think it's about to be over."

"Izzie: We know what we're doing, Mr. Duff. You saw the angio results. We're catching the AVM just in time. You don't need to be nervous. You're not gonna die."
""
"Mr. Duff: I'm not talking about dying. My whole life has been about what I see and about believing in myself, whatever people think. And you're telling me there's a very good chance that will go away."
"Izzie: Look, you're a healthy guy. You're gonna live a long, full life. And if you're psychic visions are real, you've got to believe you'll have them when you come out."

"Meredith: Thought you said you didn't believe in that stuff."

"Izzie: I grew up in a trailer park. I waited tables, which was supposed to put me through college, but my mother was always calling these psychics all the time. And the bills started piling up, so I had to use my money to pay them. When I turned 18, I left and never went back. But this guy has been saying things to me, things he couldn't possibly know anything about. So I just wonder."

"Derek: Shh, shh. I'm gonna tell you. All right. My mother's maiden name, Maloney. I have four sisters. I have, uh, nine nieces. Five nephews. I like coffee ice cream, single-malt scotch, occasionally a good cigar. I like to fly fish. And I cheat when I do the crossword puzzle on Sunday. And I never dance in public. Um, favorite novel, The Sun Also Rises. Favorite band, The Clash. My favorite color is blue. I don't like light blue, indigo. The scar right here on my forehead, that's why I don't ride motorcycles anymore. And I live in that trailer. All this land is mine. I have no idea what I'm gonna do with it. So that's it. That's all you've earned for now. The rest you're just...just gonna have to take on faith."

"George: I need to ask you something."

"Alex: Let's see it."

"George: It's kinda located in an, um, you know, private..."

"Alex: You're a doctor, George. It's called a penis. You have a rash on your penis?"

"Alex: Look, just come on. Just show me your junk so we can get this over with."

"George: So?"

"(Alex leaves and George checks out his rash in the mirror.)"
""
""
"(Patients room, there is a man on a gurney and a very pregnant woman standing at his side)"
""
"Alex: Patient presented with abdominal pain and blood in his urine. Once his workup come back unrevealing, the urologist suggested a cystoscopy."
""
"Burke: Reason?"
""
"George: To get a look inside the bladder."
""
"Man: I appreciate you doing this, Preston. I know this is a little out of your field."
""
"Burke: That's not a problem. It gives my interns something to do."
""
"Man: I have a feeling you keep them plenty busy. We were in the same frat at Tulane. It's gone from torturing pledges to torturing interns. Am I right?"
""
"Burke: Be very careful how you two answer that."
""
"Man: I could tell some stories."
""
"Burke: Bill, you have a camera snaking up your mojo. It's not the time to cross me."
""
"Woman: It isn't anything too serious?"
""
"Burke: That's what this procedure will tell us. You don't worry about anything but growing my godson in there."
""
"Woman: He kicks like you wouldn't believe."
""
"Burke: A badass, just like his father. Move a little to the right. Your other right. There."
""
"Bill: What do you see? What is it?"
""
"Burke: Could be any number of things. O'Malley, take a biopsy of the mass. Dr. Karev, schedule a CT. Let's not worry until we have to."

"Richard: There's too much damage. We'll have to remove most of the colon instead of a local resection."

"Mr. Franklin: It's been getting bigger for a while."

"Mrs. Franklin: I told him there was something wrong. No one gets fat like this so fast. I told him."
""
"Daughter: Everybody told him."
""
"Izzie: He has dullness to percussion and spider angiomas."

"Daughter: What's all that mean?"

""
"George: I don't know how this happened."

"Izzie: Of course you do. God, Olivia must really be getting around."
""
"George: Olivia, she's not like that."
""
"Izzie: It's a new millennium, George. The only people who aren't like that are the Amish and, apparently, you."
""
"George: You don't know. Maybe I've been sleeping around. Maybe I got ladies. Shut up. What am I gonna do?"
""
"Izzie: It's no biggie, couple doses of Penicillin will knock it out."
""
"George: What am I gonna do about Olivia?"
""
"Izzie: Well, for starters, stop sleeping with her, unless you want that thing to fall off."
""
"George: Ok, that is twice that you have trash-talked the girl that I could one day potentially...well, not love but like a whole lot."
""
"Izzie: If she gave it to you, you have to tell her."
""
"George: Three."
""
"Izzie: Fine. She didn't give it to you. She was a virgin when you met. You still have to tell her so she can get tested."
""
"George: Oh, yeah? How am I gonna tell her? ""Uh, hey, Olivia. How you doing? By the way, I got the syph. How about you?"""
""
"Izzie: Maybe not quite like that."

"Alex: I gotta say, George, I didn't think you had it in you. It's always the quiet ones. So whos the woman?"
""
"George: None of your business."
""
"Alex: Oh, come on. Who gave you the cooties on the playground?"
""
"George: You must have had something like this before, right?"
""
"Alex: I never talk about my penis with other men."

"George: I don't n... either, normally."

""
"Cristina: Mr. Franklin? You have a condition known as ascites."
""
"Mrs. Franklin: Oh, my God. I knew it was terrible."
""
"Izzie: It just means there's fluid in the peritoneal cavity. The abdomen. And the swelling is pressing against you lungs which is why you're having trouble breathing."
""
"Cristina: In your case, it looks like a symptom of liver disease."
""
"Alice: And it all comes together."
""
"Mrs. Franklin: Alice, not now."
""
"Cristina: Is there something we should know?"
""
"Mr. Franklin: I drink a bit."

"Alice: That's the understatement of the year."

"(Burke is reviewing Bill's scan images)"
""
"Burke: There's definitely a growth, protruding into the bladder, but look at the edges. I don't think it's a tumor."
""
"Alex: Kind of shaped like an ovary."
""
"Burke: That the flip answer you're gonna give your patient, Dr. Karev? This is one of my oldest friends. You might want to take this seriously."
""
"Alex: I'm sorry, sir."
""
"Burke: You better be."
""
"George: I got the rest of the labs back. They did a chromosome analysis of the tissue. You won't believe this."

"Cristina: Six to eight drinks a day, an alcoholic by any standard."

"Bailey: Protocol?"
""
"Cristina: Schedule a paracentesis."
""
"Bailey: Reason?"
""
"Izzie: Uh, draining the fluid will relieve the pressure from the lungs."
""
"Bailey: Good, but don't schedule it. Do it."

"Izzie: You want us to do the procedure?"

"Bailey: You've seen one, right?"

It's...you're a woman, you know? A very attractive woman. Of course you've been with other men. Not that you've been with a lot of men, it's not like you're a prostitute..."

"Olivia: Well, I like you too."
""
"(They make out again, George pushes her away)"
""
"George: I have syphilis."
""
"(Olivia looks at him and then without saying anything runs off)"
""
"George: That could have gone better."
""
""
"(Chief Webber's office, there is a picture of him on a magazine and a plaque for best doctor in America. He is still rubbing his temple. Derek knocks, enters and closes the door.)"
""
"Derek: You dropped a retractor."
""
"Richard: Fine. A few weeks ago, I was operating, and the vision in my right eye became blurry. After a few hours, it was fine. It's come back again."
""
"Derek: Did you have it checked out?"
""
"Richard: The examination was normal. My ophthalmologist tells me I'm just getting older. But you know what a decline in my visual acuity can mean."
""
"Derek: I'll set up some tests."
""
"Richard: Shep, I know how the rumor mill runs around here. Let's just keep this to ourselves."
""
"Derek: Absolutely. Yeah."
""
""
"(George is walking through the outdoor picnic area with Alex)"
""
"George: Do you think she's talking about me?"
""
"Alex: She's absolutely talking about you. Dude, that's a good thing. (They walk past Olivia's table)"
""
"George: No, no it's not."
""
"Alex: Georgie, get a clue. Syphilis is the best thing that ever happened to you. In their eyes, you're a player."
""
"(They sit down at a table with Cristina and Izzie. Izzie is feeling Cristina's forehead)"
""
"Cristina: Hey, syph-boy."
""
"George: You told her?"
""
"Izzie: Just Cristina."
""
"Alex: ""Syph-boy."" It's got a nice ring to it, it's kinda like Superboy, only diseased."
""
"Cristina: Izzie didn't have to say a word. Around here, the only thing that spreads faster than disease is gossip."
""
"George: That's not true. Just cause Izzie can't keep her mouth shut doesn't mean everyone knows."
""
"(Meredith enters)"
""
"Meredith: Hey, George. How are you feeling? Sorry about the syphilis."
""
"George: Everyone in this hospital knows?"
""
"Alex: Knows you're a player."
""
"George: You're disturbed."
""
"Alex: True. Everybody's got a secret. Just be glad yours is out in the open."
""
"Cristina: Oh, yeah, Alex? What's yours?"
""
"Alex: You show me yours, and I'll show you mine."
""
"(Cristina looks at Burke as he walks by)"
""
"Alex: I bet you've got some seriously kinky skeletons in your closet."
""
"Cristina: What's in my closet is none of your business."
""
"Izzie: Well, I don't have any secrets. My life is boring."
""
"Meredith: Everybody's got something to hide."
""
"(Everyone stares at Meredith)"
""
""
"(Burke enters Bill's room)"
""
"Burke: Well, the mass we found is not a tumor."
""
"Bill: Well, that's good, right? Anything's got to be better than cancer."
""
"Burke: Well, that's where it gets a little tricky. The chromosomal tests have revealed that your body contains DNA from two different embryos that merged in the womb at the very beginning of development. In rare cases such as yours, the condition can preduce gonadal hermaphroditism."
""
"Bill: I'm hearing scary words here, Preston, you know, pay-cable kind of words."
""
"Burke: In English, the mass in your bladder is an ovary."
""
"Bill: Huh?"
""
"Burke: Don't worry. We're gonna remove it. We have an excellent gynecological surgeon on staff."
""
"Bill: You're telling me I'm a guy with an ovary?"
""
"Burke: It's simply a quirk of nature, man."
""
"Bill: What am I gonna tell Holly?"
""
"Burke: That you're gonna be fine."
""
"Bill: I'm still a man, right?"
""
"Burke: A man's man, a Kappa man."
""
"Bill: I mean...you know, my sex life."
"Burke: You been having any problems?"
""
"Bill: (Laughing) Was it my very pregnant wife that gave it away?"
""
"(They both laugh)"
""
"Burke: Come on, man, don't worry. You never knew it was there. You won't miss it when it's gone."
""
""
"(Alex is giving George shots of penicillin)"
""
"George: Are you sure you know what you're doing?"
""
"Alex: It's a shot of penicillin, George. Be grateful I'm even doing this. I've already seen more of you than I ever wanted to. I'll be fighting nightmares for a week."
""
"George: Ok, you know what? Forget this."
""
"Alex: Do you want to get rid of the syph or not? Just shut up and drop 'em."
""
"(George pulls down his pants and bends over the gurney)"
""
"George: I cannot believe this."
""
"(Meredith enters)"
""
"George: Meredith, go away!"
""
"Meredith: Oh, George. Thought you could use some moral support."
""
"George: NO! No, moral support. I'm indisposed here."
""
"Meredith: George, it's not a big deal. And you have a cute butt."
""
"Alex: I have a cute butt too. You want to see?"
""
"Meredith: Oh, get out. You're doing it wrong."
""
"Alex: Be my guest."
""
"George: What...? Alex. Alex. Wha...?"
""
"(Alex leaves and Izzie enters)"
""
"George: Hey!"
""
"Izzie: What are we doing here?"
""
"George: Breaking George's spirit."
""
"Meredith: Curing George's syph."
""
"George: I don't like needles."
""
"Meredith: Good thing you became a doctor. Other side."
""
"(Cristina yells from the hallway)"
""
"Cristina: Izzie?"
""
"Izzie: Yeah?"
""
"Cristina: Uh, Mr. Franklin's procedure's been scheduled for after lunch..."
""
"(Cristina enters)"
""
"Cristina: Oh, what are we doing?"
""
"Izzie: We are saving George from a future of festering sores and insanity."
""
"Cristina: Oh, cute butt."
""
"Meredith: Told ya."
""
"Izzie: It is cute, like a baby's."
""
"George: You know, I have spent hours, days, years, imagining myself half-naked in a room with three women. The reality is so much better."
""
"(George leaves)"
""
"Cristina: I think he's gonna cry."
""
"(They all laugh)"
""
""
"(Meredith is on the phone with Ms. Henry from the nursing home)"
""
"Ms. Henry: Hi. It's Ms. Henry again. Is this a better time?"
""
"Meredith: Sorry about this morning. I wasn't alone and...what were you calling about?"
""
"Ms. Henry: I just wanted to remind you that tonight's our monthly family dinner. You know, you haven't been to any of our family functions."
""
"Meredith: You have to understand. I'm a surgical intern, so my time isn't my own."
""
"Ms. Henry: Our residents really respond to these events. They always enjoy themselves which is so rare. I think it's important you attend."
""
"Meredith: I'll be there. I'll try to be there. I'll definitely try."
""
""
"(Derek and Richard walking through the hall)"
""
"Derek: I've cleared some time for your MRI."
""
"Richard: Good. Let's get going."
""
"Derek: Ok."
""
"(Derek leaves as Patricia walks up)"
""
"Patricia: Uh, sorry to bother you with this, chief. We've got kind of a situation."
""
"Richard: What now?"
""
"(Richard is standing in front of a room full of doctors and interns with Patricia seated near him)"
""
"Richard: Three interns, four residents and six nurses on this surgical floor have been diagnosed with...syphilis."
""
"(The room makes oohing noises)"
""
"Patricia: There are over 70,000 new cases every year."
""
""
"(Olivia looks at George across the room)"
""
"Patricia: Undiagnosed, syphilis can lead to blindness, insanity and death."
""
"Richard: If you are having unprotected sex with another member of the staff, get tested."
""
"(Burke looks at Cristina across the room)"
""
"Richard: This is not a request."
""
"(Everyone laughs)"
""
"Richard: Patricia will now give you a safe-sex demonstration."
""
"(Laughing continues)"
""
"(Patricia stands up holding a condom and a banana)"
""
"Patricia: When the time is right, and, gentlemen, you'll all know when that time is, carefully open the condom packet and roll it onto the banana."
""
"(Derek enters)"
""
"Derek: (Whispering to Richard) We should try and get down to do the MRI now."
""
"Richard: This isn't really a good time."
""
"Derek: If you want to do this without anybody else knowing, you should do it now."
""
"Patricia: Open communication is essential to a healthy relationship. In a responsible relationship..."
""
"Meredith: (Whispering to Cristina) Poor George."
""
"Cristina: Yeah. You know, I think he really likes Typhoid Mary."
""
"Meredith: Well, not many budding relationships survive a good dose of VD."
""
"Cristina: Yeah."
""
"Patricia: When the banana is finished..."
""
"Meredith: Yeah."
""
"Patricia:...gently peel off the condom and dispose of it properly. With every fresh banana, always use a fresh condom."
""
""
"(The line to the blood lab is VERY long, Cristina is at the end of it. The elevator nearby dings open and a lab tech gets out. Burke is in the elevator not planning on exiting until he sees Cristina and then he hurries out of the elevator. He gets in the blood lab line.)"
""
"Burke: You're avoiding me."
""
"Cristina: I'm busy, at work. I-I'm working."
""
"Burke: Why are you in this line?"
""
"Cristina: It's the syphilis line."
""
"Burke: You don't need to be in this line."
""
"Cristina: I don't?"
""
"Burke: There's no one else. (Cristina looks at him surprised) That surprises you?"
""
"Cristina: Nothing surprises me."
""
"Burke: Do I need to be in this line?"
""
"Cristina: No."
""
"Burke: Ok, then."
""
"Cristina: Ok."
""
"(They both get out of the line and head in opposite directions)"
""
""
"(Izzie walks up)"
""
"Izzie: Hey."
""
"Cristina: Oh, hey."
""
"Izzie: Mr. Franklin is prepped and ready."
""
"Cristina: Excellent."
""
"Izzie: God, look at this line. Well, at least we don't have to stand in line. That's the one good thing about the fact neither of us is getting any, right?"
""
"Cristina: Yeah."
""
"(They go to Mr. Franklin's room)"
""
"Cristina: Mr. Franklin, we've given you a local anesthetic, but you might feel some pressure."
""
"Mr. Franklin: Ok. I'm ready."
""
"Cristina: Grab the skin."
""
"Izzie: Ok."
""
"Cristina: I'm in the peritoneal cavity."
""
"Izzie: That fluid is bloody. Is it supposed to be bloody?"
""
"Mr. Franklin: You've done this before, right?"
""
"Cristina: Of course. Millions of times."
""
"Izzie: You're doing great, Mr. Franklin."
""
"Cristina: Ok. Wait, wait. Ok, go. Good. Now all we have to do is wait."
""
""
"(Derek and Richard are examining his MRI scans)"
""
"Derek: You see that right there?"
""
"Richard: Mm-hmm."
""
"Derek: It's a tumor, and it's pressing against your optic nerve."
""
"Richard: Is it operable?"
""
"Derek: Oh, definitely. It does have its risks."
""
"Richard: You mean I could lose my sight? Just what I need, a syphilis outbreak and a tumor."
""
"Derek: Well, it's probably unrelated."
""
"Richard: All right, Derek, lets see how good you really are."
""
"Derek: All right. I'll put a team together."
""
"Richard: All my people only. And I still want this kept under wraps. The vultures will be circling soon enough."
""
"Derek: Aren't I one of the vultures?"
""
"Richard: Why do you think I want to keep an eye on you? Get going. We're doing this tonight."
""
"Derek: Right."
""
"(Meredith enters just as Richard is leaving)"
""
"Meredith: You paged?"
""
"Derek: Yeah, I need you to help me out on something for the chief. Can you keep a secret?"
""
"Meredith: Better than you think."
""
""
"(Cristina and Izzie in Mr. Franklin's room)"
""
"Cristina: How much fluid can one body hold?"
""
"Izzie: Shh! There's a lot of fluid in there, Mr. Franklin, but were almost finished. Mr. Franklin, are you sleeping?(She shakes him) Mr. Franklin? (She checks his pulse) He has no pulse."
""
"Cristina: What?"
""
"Izzie: He has no pulse!"
""
"(Cristina hits the code button will Izzie starts CPR, the code team runs in a moment later)"
""
"(Cristina and Izzie leaving the room)"
""
"Cristina: How could he die just like that with no warning?"
""
"Izzie: There was blood in the tube when it first went in. What if it's our fault? What if we did something wrong?"
""
"Cristina: We didn't do anything wrong. We did a textbook procedure."
""
"(They walk up to a desk where Bailey is standing)"
""
"Bailey: I checked you chart. You did everything by the book."
""
"Izzie: He died on our watch. We must have missed something."
""
"Bailey: You couldn't have known. There was no history of heart problems. His death wasn't your fault."
""
"Cristina: When's the autopsy?"
""
"Bailey: There isn't gonna be an autopsy."
""
"Cristina: What? How are we supposed to know the cause of death?"
""
"Bailey: It's going down as cardiopulmonary arrest complicated by liver disease."
""
"Izzie: But an autopsy would..."
""
"Bailey: The family decided they didn't want an autopsy."
""
"Cristina: But, Dr. Bailey..."
""
"Bailey: They don't want an autopsy. Let it go."
""
""
"(Derek runs up to Bailey and Meredith in the hall)"
""
"Derek: How goes out special super secret silent sunset surgery? I've been practicing that."
""
"Bailey: You have too much time on your hands. Uh, tell the chief I'll be there. Just let me know when and where. I'm in."
""
"Meredith: Ok. (Bailey leaves) are you nervous?"
""
"Derek: It's a complicated surgery. I make one mistake, I end a fellow surgeon's career, my mentor's career. Oh, no, I'm not nervous."
""
"Meredith: So just for the record..."
""
"Derek: Mm-hmm."
""
"Meredith: ...you'd tell me if I need to get tested, right?"
""
"Derek: You think I have syphilis?"
""
"Meredith: No, I don't. It's just...we never made any rules or anything. I mean, we never said, ""We have rules,"" and I wouldn't hold it against you. Derek: When would I have time to go out and get syphilis? You're a handful enough as it is, and besides, we're like, practically a condom ad."
""
"Meredith: But no more glow-in-the-dark ones."
""
"Derek: You see? There's nothing to worry about. Maybe we should, you know make some rules, I mean."
""
"Meredith: We should."
""
"Derek: Ok."
""
"Meredith: Ok."
""
"Derek: Just for the record..."
""
"Meredith: Uh-huh?"
""
"Derek: I like the glow-in-the-dark ones."

"Meredith: I bet you do."

"(Meredith leaves and Derek's phone rings, he doesn't answer it but looks concerned)"
""
""
"(Bill's surgery)"
""
"Dr. Knox: That's the last of the ovarian material. I just need to sew up the perforation on the bladder wall.(Looks at Burke) Uh... (Shakes her head)"
""
"Burke: Is there a problem, Dr. Knox?"
""
"Dr. Knox: Well, you said this man's wife is pregnant?"
""
"Burke: Due in five weeks. Why?"
""
"Dr. Knox: Our patient has a blind vas deferens."
""
"Burke: Bill is sterile?"
""
"Dr. Knox: And always has been."
""
"George: Then who got his wife pregnant?"
""
"(Everyone just looks at each other)"
""
"George: Oh!"
""
"Alex: Sucks to be Bill right now."
""
"(Alex, George and Burke are walking through the hallway)"
""
"George: How's Burke gonna tell him the baby's not his?"
""
"Alex: Burke's not gonna tell him."
""
"George: He has to, their friends."
""
"Alex: Bill's better off not knowing."
""
"George: Do you think Holly knows Bill's not the father?"
""
"Alex: Maybe, maybe not."
""
"George: I think Bill should know his wife's cheating on him. I'd wanna know."
""
"Burke: I don't remember asking for your opinions, so keep them to yourselves."
""
"George: Sorry, sir. (To Alex) You're such as gossip."
""
""
"(Izzie and Cristina are in the waiting room with Alice and Mrs. Franklin)"
""
"Izzie: We know how confusing this must be, your husband dying so suddenly. But an autopsy will tell us why."
""
"Mrs. Franklin: So you think we should do the autopsy?"
""
"Alice: No, we just wasn't this to be over."
""
"Cristina: But, don't you want to know for certain what killed him?"
""
"Alice: My father was a mean drunk who couldn't hold a job. That's what killed him."
""
"Izzie: I understand that you're angry. But knowing for sure might help give you some closure."
""
"Mrs. Franklin: It was awfully sudden, Alice."
""
"Alice: Sudden? He's been killing himself for years."
""
"Mrs. Franklin: He was a good man. Maybe...maybe they're right. Maybe we should do the autopsy."
""
"Alice: Mom, stop it. He's dead. It's finally over."
""
"Mrs. Franklin: Alice, your father would have wanted..."
""
"Alice: Who cares what he wanted? Can't we please just try and get out of this with whatever shred of dignity this family has left?"
""
""
"(Izzie, Cristina and Meredith are in the unused hallway sitting on a gurney)"
""
"Meredith: You guys want to perform an unauthorized autopsy?"
""
"Izzie: I know you, Cristina. You do not want to be known as the new 007. An autopsy clears your name."
""
"Meredith: Cristina, no."
""
"Izzie: What about Franklin's wife? You saw the way she was looking at me. She wants the autopsy. She just didn't want to fight with her daughter. She looked so sad. Ok, Cristina Yang, license to kill."
""
"Cristina: Ok, I'm in."
""
"Meredith: I am so not involved in this."
""
"Cristina: Meredith, this is Fight Club. Nobody talks about it."

"Cristina: Well, we have to take our chances."

"Izzie: What kind of something?"
""
"Meredith: Oh, I can't tell you that. It's Fight Club too."
""

"Cristina: If I'm missing out on a real patient because of this, they're gonna call me 007 because I've killed you."
""
""
"(Derek enters the OR, the door has signs that read Do Not Enter-Closed For Maintenance. Richard is inside prepping for his surgery.)"
""
"Derek: How we doing?"
""
"Richard: Did you lock up the gallery?"
""
"Derek: Don't worry. We're flying under the radar. What did you put out there, the Midas Rex?"
""
"Bailey: We've got it, chief."

"Richard: How much cancomycin is there?"
""
"Bailey: One gram, as ordered, sir."
""
"Richard: You're not gonna be too liberal with those benzos, are ya?"
""
"Derek: You know, doctors make the worst patients. You should just breathe in the happy gas. Stop running my OR. I got you covered."
""
""
"(Cristina and Izzie have Mr. Franklin's body and are getting ready to start the autopsy)"
""
"Izzie: We stole a body. We're body snatchers. What if somebody from the morgue comes looking for Franklin?"
""
"Cristina: Well, A, it's in the middle of the night, and, B, the thing about being dead is people stop looking for you."
""
"Izzie: Ok. (Clears her throat and prepares to start)"
""
"Cristina: When's the last time you did an autopsy?"

"Izzie: I took gross anatomy just like you. I'm just trying to remember."

"Burke: Does he know you've been cheating on him?"

"Holly: Preston, this is between Bill and me."
""
"Burke: Then man has a right to know that this isn't his child."
""
"Holly: Please, just let this go. Why can't you let this go?"

"Burke: Because Bill is my best friend. That's why."

"Holly: If you were really his friend, you wouldn't do this."

"Burke: Holly, please! Tell him the truth!"

"Holly: Why? I'm not gonna ruin my life, because you think this is wrong."

"Burke: Your life? What about his life? What about this child's life?"

"Holly: What Bill doesn't know won't hurt him."

"Meredith: I know but something came up, an important surgery and I couldn't."
""
"Ms. Henry: I'm just sorry you couldn't be there for your mother."
""
"Meredith: Ms. Henry, if my mother were lucid, she would understand. She's a surgeon. She's done this countless times. And besides that, she doesn't even know who I am, anyway, so..."

"Ms. Henry: Today she did."

"Derek: Why?"

"Meredith: She has Alzheimer's."

"Bailey: Don't even tell me you're doing what I think you're doing!"
""
"Cristina: Um..."
""
"Bailey: Not only did you disregard the family's wishes, you broke the law! You could be arrested for assault! Do you like jail? The hospital could be sued! I could lose my license, my job! I like my job! Did you think about any of this before you started cutting open a poor man's body? I could seriously kick both of your asses right now. Do you have anything to say?"

"Izzie: Look at his heart."

"Bailey: I understand why you're upset."
""
"Alice: You understand? We're gonna get an attorney. Come on, Mom."
""
"Cristina: We know what killed him. He had a blood condition known as hemachromatosis. The disease causes an excess amount of iron to build up in the body, and that's what caused the heart failure, not the paracentesis."
""
"Alice: But I thought he was always so sick cause of the drinking."
""
"Mrs. Franklin: And you never let him forget it. Or me."
""
"Alice: Mom..."
""
"Izzie: There's something else. The disease is genetic."
""
"Mrs. Franklin: You think Alice could have it too?"
""
"Izzie: A simple blood test will tell us. If you have it, we'll have caught it early enough to treat it before the condition becomes critical."
""
"Bailey: Dr. Stevens and Dr. Yang may have saved your life. If you could just sign this consent form for the autopsy. Just a formality."

"Olivia: George, I want you to understand, when we started dating, I was already kind of seeing someone. I didn't know how much I'd like you, and when I realized, I broke it off with the other guy..."
""
"George: Other guy? Who's the other guy?"
""
"(Olivia looks up and George turns around to see Alex standing there)"
""
"George: You and Alex? You and Alex?! (Screaming at Alex as he attacks him) You gave me syphilis?!"
""
"Olivia, Izzie, Cristina, and Meredith: George! George! George! George, back off!"

"(They pull George off of Alex)"
""
"Meredith: Alex!"
""
"Cristina: George!"

"Izzie: Back off, Alex."

"(Meredith enters the lobby where Derek is waiting for her)"
""
"MVO: And once your secrets are out in the open, you don't have to hide behind them anymore."
""
"Derek: Long day."
""
"Meredith: Yeah."
""
"Derek: Somewhere out this is a steak with your name on it and maybe a bottle of wine."
""
"Meredith: This is why I keep you around."
""
"Derek: So we need to talk."
""
"Meredith: Wine first, talk later."
""
"Derek: You trying to, uh, get me drunk so you can take advantage of me?"
""
"Meredith: I think I like this rules thing."
""
"Derek: Me too."
""
"(Derek helps her fix her coat and they turn to leave. A stunning red headed woman is standing there and Derek is wide eyed)"
""
"Derek: (Turning to Meredith) Meredith, I am so sorry."
""
"MVO: The problem with secrets is even when you think you're in control..."
""
"(The woman walks over)"
""
"Derek: Addison."
""
"MVO: ...you're not."
""
"Derek: What are you doing here?"
""
"Addison: Well, you'd know if you'd bothered to return any one of my phone calls."
""
"Addison: (To Meredith) Hi. I'm Addison Shepherd."
""
"(They shake hands)"
""
"Meredith: Shepherd?"
""
"Addison: (Pointing at Meredith) And you must be the woman who's been screwing my husband."
""
"(Meredith looks at Addison and then at Derek)"
