00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:20.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

351
00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:06.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
wherever he's going

00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:21.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But he was
at all those other trees, too,

356
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:29.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

There's a hole in the snow.

358
00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a Rocco-sized tunnel.

359
00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:33.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's in the snow.

360
00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobody would dig a tunnel
in the snow, would they?

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, isn't it really,
really cold?

00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it's warmer down there

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:47.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
than up here in Acorn Springs,
so small animals like Rocco

365
00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:49.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
dig tunnels
all through the snow.

366
00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But that means Rocco
and the cupcakes

367
00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
could be anywhere.

368
00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe if we draw lines

369
00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:59.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
between all the places
Rocco was seen,

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they all meet up

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

we'll find Rocco

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:22.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

377
00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:25.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You decorated the cupcakes
with acorns.

378
00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We know how much
Bean loves acorns,

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to find them in the winter.

380
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we all picked out
our best ones

381
00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:33.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:38.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:43.474 --> 00:19:46.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
