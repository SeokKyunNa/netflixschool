00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

140
00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you must have seen her then.

00:07:57.102 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Her mom? A grown-up gray whale
would be pretty big.

153
00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

154
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Poppy's mom <i>is </i>BigFin.

165
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what are you guys doing
in the lagoon?

166
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

gray whales like Poppy's mom

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:10.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

saw whales in the lagoon,

172
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We followed the facts we had,

320
00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it looks like your star
got away. I'm sorry, Bean.

321
00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] What do we do now?

322
00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:51.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We just have to wait
until tonight

323
00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so Bean can wish
on a brand-new star.

324
00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:58.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And this time,
we'll be ready to catch it.

325
00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:06.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This star stakeout
is officially on,

326
00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you know,
as soon as it gets dark.

327
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And while we wait,
we can have a snack.

328
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I baked some cookies
that look like stars.

329
00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go on. Take one.

330
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

331
00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:22.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look. My star cookie is
up floating in the sky

332
00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
right by that
fire-breathing dragon.

333
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:28.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow! That cloud
does look like a dragon.

334
00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't let it eat your cookie.

335
00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs] It won't have
a chance to eat Bean's cookie,

336
00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
not with the princess
protecting it.

337
00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:39.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's not afraid
of fire-breathing dragons.

338
00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. Look at that.

[Millie]
The princess and the dragon

340
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:46.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
have decided to join forces
to save the knight.

341
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:50.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See? He's stuck
up in a great, big tower.

342
00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That shooting star!

343
00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bean, quick! Make your wish,
and let's get that star!

344
00:17:57.368 --> 00:18:01.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I'm wishing
for all my adventures.

345
00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:03.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, then, Star Catchers.

346
00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's star-catching time.

347
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It went that way!

348
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yippee!

349
00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:10.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's do this!

350
00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
...and the pirate
and the mountain climbers...

351
00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Guys, wait for me!

352
00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:24.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what do we do now?

353
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:27.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jay] There's so many trees,
we can't see Bean's star.

354
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a jungle in here.

355
00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we're gonna find Bean's star,

356
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:34.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we're gonna have to get through
this very jungley jungle.

357

358
00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:37.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was that?

359
00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:41.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It sounded like a crested
black macaque or a macaw...

360
00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:44.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or a macaroon.
Almost impossible to say.

361
00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:49.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We better move. Let's cross
the jungle safari-style.

362
00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:52.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everybody do the safari sneak.

363
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:57.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now everybody do
the jungle jump.

364
00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:58.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[yelling and hooting]

366
00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. Where'd my star go?

367
00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:14.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It went this way.
I'm sure of it,

368
00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:17.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but shooting stars
just fall so fast,

369
00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:18.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's hard to catch 'em!

370
00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right, and once
they go behind the trees,

371
00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:24.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there's just no way
of knowing where they landed.

372
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute. All those things
you mentioned are clues,

373
00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
clues we can use.

374
00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If the trees are blocking our view,

375
00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we've gotta find
a place above them.

376
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How are we gonna get up high?
-We climb.

377
00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We made it!
We hiked to the top

378
00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just like
the Merry Mountaineers.

379
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:52.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Toby] Wow, we can see
every single star

380
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in Acorn Springs from here.

381
00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:57.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] They're beautiful.

382
00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:59.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, when you see
a shooting star,

383
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can make your wish.

384
00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we'll be able to catch
it for sure this time.

385
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't wait.
I've never caught a star before.

386
00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:08.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah! There goes one
and another and--

387
00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, boy.

388
00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Somebody catch one!

389
00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:14.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

390
00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's getting away!

391
00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[panting] Get back here!

392
00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:23.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna get you,
you shooting star.

393
00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oops!
-Ahh!

394
00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:28.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Teri] I got it! I got it!

395
00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:29.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[thump]

396
00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:32.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh. I don't think
that worked out

397
00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
exactly like we hoped.

398
00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:36.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right.
Now that we're up here,

399
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:39.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you can see the shooting stars
are actually really far away.

400
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And none of them are
actually hitting the ground.

401
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:45.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks like they're
just disappearing in the sky.

402
00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, where are they going?

403
00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:52.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It says here that shooting stars
are bits of space dust.

404
00:20:52.453 --> 00:20:54.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They light up
when they get close to us,

405
00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then, fwoosh, they just vanish.

406
00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:58.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, Bean.

407
00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know you really wanted
your wish to come true.

408
00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:03.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really did.

409
00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:07.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you know what? Even though
we didn't catch a star,

410
00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Bean <i>did </i>get his wish.

00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:11.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did?

412
00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:14.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. We dug for treasure
like real pirates.

413
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we saw knights and
princesses in the clouds.

414
00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:20.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And played a game of
follow the leader in the jungle.

415
00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And don't forget
we climbed to the top

416
00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:25.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of the highest mountain
in Acorn Springs.

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:30.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was everything I wished for,
and we did it all.

00:21:30.873 --> 00:21:34.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess you don't need stars
to make your wishes come true.

419
00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:36.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You guys are better than all
the shooting stars in the world.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:45.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everybody smile,
and say, "Shooting stars"!
