00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope they find
the presents soon.

107
00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] Yeah, I was
really looking forward

108
00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to seeing what everyone
made this year.

109
00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know. Let's find a new way
to thank our friends.

110
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We may not have
presents to give,

111
00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:47.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but we could give each other
the gift of dance.

112
00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] That's so...

113
00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
poetic.

114
00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:53.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Since it's
a dance to friendship,

115
00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we should do it together.

116
00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Great idea!
Everyone, make a circle.

117
00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah! And then we can all

118
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
celebrate each other
with dance!

119
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can start! Watch me work.

120
00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Go, Jay! Go, Jay! Go, Jay!

121
00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah!
-Whoo-hoo!

122
00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right!

123
00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[panting]

124
00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:24.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the perfect spot
to play with our presents.

125
00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now let's see what we've got.

126
00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Our presents"?

127
00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:31.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How can they be ours
if we're giving them back?

128
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:34.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, yeah, they're just ours
until we're done with them.

129
00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll return them all,
except maybe this doll.

130
00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And nobody's gonna miss this.

131
00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, wait. I want this, too.
-[squeaks]

132
00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ooh! And I've always
wanted one of these.

133
00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, I don't even know what
this does, but I want it!

134
00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

135
00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ohh!

136
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[head rattles]
[sighs]

137
00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

138
00:06:58.293 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

139
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Go, Wayne! Go, Wayne!

140
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go, Wayne! Go, Wayne!

141
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, guys, this is
my dance to friendship!

142
00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[cheering]

143
00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-All right!
-Whoa!

144
00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:17.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh. Toby, look.

145
00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a feather.

146
00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's evidence for sure.

147
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute.
Are these wolf prints?

148
00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A feather and wolf prints?
Of course.

149
00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The feather
has to belong to Poe!

150
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:33.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And his best friend is Fergus,
and he's a wolf pup,

151
00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that's why
we've got wolf prints.

152
00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And look! Down that trail.

153
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a ribbon
from one of the presents.

154
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll bet Poe, Fergus, and our
missing presents went this way.

155
00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sitting
in a huge pile of presents.

156
00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never had
so much fun stuff ever,

157
00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so why am I
not having any fun?

158
00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe it's because those
presents weren't meant for you.

159
00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:04.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you know
you should give them back.

160
00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm not
done playing with them!

161
00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:09.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Poe, each one of these presents

162
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
was made especially
for someone.

163
00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And presents aren't presents
when you take them.

164
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the sharing with friends
that makes them special.

165
00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here you go.

166
00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's this?

167
00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Teri] When we asked you
to come to the festival,

168
00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-we made you something special.
-Oh.

169
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's pictures
from the first time we met.

170
00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:31.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You made this
just for me? Why?

171
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because you're our friend,

172
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it feels really good to give
something special to a friend.

173
00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Haven't you ever given
something to a friend?

174
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not giving you my picture.

175
00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't have to.

176
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here. This is for Fergus.

177
00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Go ahead.
You can give it to him if you want.

178
00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eh, I don't know.

179
00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could really use
this exact thingie

180
00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't know
I previously needed,

181
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I think you'd like it
more than me, Fergus.

182
00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here you go.

183
00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks, Poe. I love it!

184
00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ohh! [laughs]

185
00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow, you do?
I'm glad you like it.

186
00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:13.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

187
00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It feels nice to share
something with a friend.

188
00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who knew?

189
00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, tiny ants, bats,

190
00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:24.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and even elephants
all give to each other.

191
00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:28.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you know who else shares things
with animals that they care about?

192
00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ravens.
It's how they make friends.

193
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, no one will wanna be friends

194
00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a raven
who took all their presents.

195
00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unless he gives them back.

196
00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

197
00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right!

198
00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You guys know how to throw
a first-rate shindig.

199
00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know how this
could have been any more fun.

200
00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Teri]
What if there were presents?

201
00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Millie]
You found the presents?

202
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Toby] We did more than that.

203
00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:55.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We found someone special
to hand them out.

204
00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:59.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi, everyone! I'm Papa Acorn!

205
00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'm here to give you

206
00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
all the special things
you made for each other.

207
00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I've brought
my trusty sidekick,

208
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the Present Wolf, to help.

209
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all cheering]

210
00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh...

211
00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:15.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry I took your presents.

212
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't know how much
