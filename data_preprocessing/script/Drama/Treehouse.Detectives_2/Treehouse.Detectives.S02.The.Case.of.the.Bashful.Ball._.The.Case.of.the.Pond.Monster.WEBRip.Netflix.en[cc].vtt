Oh, and the roots
are even better,

324
00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you have to dive all the way to
the bottom of the pond to get them.

325
00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:03.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Roots at bottom, super yummy.

326
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You dive underwater?

327
00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To get the roots, yeah!

There are always
lily pads in the pond,

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:17.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but look!
There's a bunch on the trail!

330
00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:23.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Interesting.
How did they get here,

331
00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
all the way from the pond?

332
00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's mud, too.

333
00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:34.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks like our pond monster
went this way.

334

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the pond monster
went that way,

336
00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I'd like to stay here.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course.
We can keep each other safe.

339
00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As long as you're here

340
00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not so scared.

341
00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, we could even
skip some stones!

342
00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure!

343
00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay.
We'll be back with answers.

344
00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a lily pad up here.
Look!

345
00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:13.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How'd it get up there?

346
00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:17.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Remember? Rumy said
the pond monster was gigantic!

347
00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:19.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What if every time
our pond monster

348
00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
brushed against
one of these trees,

349
00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:22.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he left a lily pad?

350
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which means
he's not made of lily pads.

351
00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:26.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's wearing them.

352
00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wearing lily pads?

353
00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But why
would someone wear lily pads?

354
00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:33.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you might
not do it on purpose.

355
00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you were a big, scary monster

356
00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:37.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you rose up
out of the pond,

357
00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you might end up
covered in lily pads.

358
00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if the pond monster
lives in the pond,

359
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:46.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
how come the moose
has never, ever seen him?

360
00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:50.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we'd better head back
and ask some more questions.

361
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I'm afraid
we skipped so many stones

362
00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:58.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that all the best ones
are at the bottom of the pond.

363
00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:01.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right. I'll go
in the water and get them!

364
00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:05.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do it all the time.
You just stay right here,

365
00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I'll go get us some rocks.

366
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, aren't you afraid
of the pond monster?

367
00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:13.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What if you make him mad
and he comes running out again?

368
00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:15.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

369
00:19:15.696 --> 00:19:18.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You wait here,
and I'll be right back.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:24.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:36.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:34.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
