00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:19.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And when I looked back
at Millie's glasses,

108
00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:22.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they were gone.
[gasps, sighs]

109
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:25.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that has to mean the
flying fish took them, right?

110
00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or your glasses went downstream.

111
00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See how the creek moves
really fast through here?

112
00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anything that falls in here
ends up down there.

113
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Down where?

114
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Down there!

115
00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. [chuckles] Sorry.

116
00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know where, exactly?

117
00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:44.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just go straight downstream until
you get to the bottom of the fast part.

118
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It gets really swirly.

119
00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Swirly. Got it.

120
00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you see the blue rocks,
turn left.

121
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, and say hello
to the minnows for me.

122
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're just
the cutest little fish.

123
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks, Dipsy.
You've been super helpful.

124
00:05:58.316 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank <i>you! </i>I gotta go.

125
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:00.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's time for my lunch.

126
00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But good luck downstream,
and be careful.

127
00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The creek's
pretty deep down there.

128
00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't see any blue rocks.

129
00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's okay! Look!

130
00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:16.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are Millie's glasses. See?

131
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Teri]
They're way down on the bottom.

132
00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't get down that far.

133
00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure, we can!
Toby just has to build a submarine.

134
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah! Toby can build
a big submarine

135
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a popcorn machine!

136
00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And a roller coaster!

137
00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:33.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A submarine with a popcorn
machine and a roller coaster!

138
00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then we'll climb inside and
go on an adventure with popcorn.

139
00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long would that take?

140
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It might be easier
to find an animal

141
00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that can swim to the
bottom of the creek.

142
00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's think about
who we know that could do that.

143
00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:50.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Bean] The flying fish!

144
00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can find him later, Bean.

145
00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right now,
we are trying to figure out

146
00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who can help us
get my glasses back.

147
00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know. I just saw him
right over there.

148
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't see him, unless he
looks like rocks or trees.

149
00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He went that way. I promise!

150
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, the flying fish
would definitely be able to help

151
00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if we could find him.

152
00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bean, lead the way
to that fish.

153
00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on!

154
00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:25.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tell me again. Why are we
chasing the flying fish?

155
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because he's the only
one around here

156
00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who can get Millie's glasses
off the bottom of the creek.

157
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes! We have to find him.

158
00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So which way did he fly?

159
00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He didn't. He walked.
-He walked?

160
00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yup. He came out of the water
and kind of scurried into the bushes.

161
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So if we follow the facts,

162
00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that means
our flying fish has feet.

163
00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if he's got feet,
he's left footprints.

164
00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Toby] I see some!

165
00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:57.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our flying <i>and </i>walking fish
went this way. Come on!

166
00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chirping]

167
00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The trail leads to Dipsy.

168
00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's definitely a clue.

169
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dipsy. Hello?

170
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hi, detectives
and detectives' friends!

171
00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you on the case?

172
00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you see the minnows?
Did you find your friend's glasses?

173
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. They were right
where you said they'd be,

174
00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:25.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but it was too deep for us.
-Right by the blue rocks?

175
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We never saw any blue rocks.

176
00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? That's strange.

177
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're right there
by the minnows.

178
00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, those minnows are so cute!

179
00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah, the minnows.

180
00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mentioned them before.

181
00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:39.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I almost never see fish.

182
00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? I see them all the time.

183
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait a minute.

184
00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All that stuff is underwater.

185
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why we need
the flying fish.

186
00:08:48.488 --> 00:08:50.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We need someone who
can dive, sploosh, to the bottom

187
00:08:50.894 --> 00:08:52.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of the creek and get
back Millie's glasses.

188
00:08:52.888 --> 00:08:54.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] Ooh, ooh, ooh! Ooh!

189
00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Uh, Dipsy?
-I can do that!

190
00:08:57.454 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I go, sploosh, down there
all the time. Come on!

191
00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:06.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we just found
our flying fish.

192
00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:10.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And she's not a fish at all.
It's Dipsy.

193
00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I see them, right down there
by the blue rocks!

194
00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:20.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you see 'em? Wait here.
I'll be right back. [inhales]

195
00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's happening?
What's happening?

196
00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dipsy just walked
into the water.

197
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And dove under!
-Of course.

198
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why Dipsy told us
to look out for minnows.

199
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was giving us
directions underwater.

200
00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the time, we were looking
for a flying fish,

201
00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:41.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but what Bean saw
wasn't a flying fish at all.

202
00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a bird that swims.

203
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:46.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything about ouzels,
from the shape of their tails

204
00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to how their eyes work,
is designed

205
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so they can walk around
and even fly underwater.

206
00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Cool!
-Amazing.

207
00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:56.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ooh! I want to see that
when I get my glasses back.

208
00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>♪ Dah dah dah dah ♪</i>
Here they are,

209
00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
good as new,
and they're really clean.

210
00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, there you are! [laughs]

211

It's nice to finally meet you.

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. I don't remember.

321
00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:58.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on! Let's go find out!

322
00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:02.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look! Millie's sculpture
is in the sun,

323
00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:05.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that explains why it melted.
Case closed.

324
00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:07.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great detective work, everyone.

325
00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bean and I just have to make
our next masterpiece

326
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:12.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
someplace shady
so it won't melt.

327
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should go to Shady Glade!

328
00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:18.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh! Shady Glade is
the shadiest of glades.

329
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then that's where we're going.

330
00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess this case is closed.

331
00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:23.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks, everybody!
We'll call you

332
00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when we're ready to unveil
the next masterpiece.

333
00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, I need to remember
to bake pretzels

334
00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
every time
I'm making great art.

335
00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All this creating
makes you hungry.

336
00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:41.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah! And we need our energy

337
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:44.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to sculpt our
never-gonna-melt Rumy sculpture.

338
00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[shivers] Now we can share
our masterpiece with the world.

339
00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:00.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I call this one
<i>Rumy With a View.</i>

340
00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all gasp]

341
00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:04.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys were right.

342
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:08.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This was the perfect spot to
set free my artistic instincts.

343
00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:09.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Behold!

344
00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:12.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes? A question. [laughs]

345
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:15.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About my vision? My message?

346
00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, about my nose.

347
00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:21.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does it really do <i>that?</i>

348
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps]

349
00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How can this one melt, too?

350
00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:29.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just terrible.

351
00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aw, don't be upset, Millie.

352
00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If there's a pig out there with
a melty face, he'd love this.

353
00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:39.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like we're back
on the case... again!

354
00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna take a sample,
you know, for evidence.

355
00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:48.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let's follow the facts.

356
00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:50.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do we know for sure?

357
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We know that snow-pigs melt
faster than anything.

358
00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:56.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As soon as Millie finishes one,
it just goes all melty.

359
00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right, Jay.
Both sculptures melted,

360
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:03.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but one was in the sun,
and one was in the shade.

361
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So if we use the clues,

362
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:08.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it had to be something else
that made them melt.

363
00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:12.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Toby, what about the snowman
we made this morning?

364
00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:13.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course!

365
00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:17.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We should see if he's melting
just like Millie's sculptures.

366
00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your snowman's
not melted at all.

367
00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:26.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right.
So what's different?

368
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I know. I know.

369
00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs] You don't
have to raise your hand.

370
00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I know the answer.

371
00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:38.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Both of Millie's statues
had hats, but this one doesn't.

372
00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:41.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course. There's nothing
warmer than a nice hat,

373
00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and warm is what melts snow.

374
00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can still have a hat.
It just needs to be made out of snow.

375
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:52.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, yes, this adds a whole new
something to our work.

376
00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:55.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A whole new-- What's the word?

377
00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, hat?

378
00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:59.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Exactly!
Let's make a masterpiece.

379
00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, everyone.
We'd love the help.

380
00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Oh, boy!

381
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never thought I'd say it,
but Rumy's gonna make a Rumy.

382
00:19:09.809 --> 00:19:12.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we've got more
of Millie's sourdough pretzels.

383
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:14.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When we get hungry, we can
take a break and share them.

384
00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:17.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs]
Art can be delicious.

385
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:25.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Teri, look.
The snow from Millie's sculpture

386
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
isn't snow anymore. It's water!

387
00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:31.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The snow has melted.

388
00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:34.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But wait. There's something
floating around in there.

389
00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:38.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Toby]
It's little bits of pretzel!

390
00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:40.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That makes sense.

391
00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:42.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When Millie and Bean
took breaks,

392
00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:44.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they split a pretzel, right?

393
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:48.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They did,
but would pretzels melt snow?

394
00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:49.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pretzels wouldn't,

395
00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:53.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but Millie's sourdough pretzels
are covered with sea salt,

396
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and when you put salt on snow...

397
00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:59.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It melts, like when I put salt
on the stairs of the treehouse.

398
00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So when Millie and Bean
ate the pretzel...

399
00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:05.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they got salt
all over their mittens

400
00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:06.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the sculptures!

401
00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why they melted.

402
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:12.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Teri, Bean had four
of the pretzels left.

403
00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:15.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If those guys even touch
the salty pretzels,

404
00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:17.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they're going to melt
another masterpiece.

405
00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on.
Time to stop that snacking.

406
00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

407
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:40.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[slow-motion]
Don't touch that...

408
00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[normal]
sculpture!

409
00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not with those salty mittens!

410
00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:48.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
H-How is there salt
on our mittens?

411
00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:52.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's from the pretzels.

412
00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And when the salt got
on Millie's sculptures,

413
00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:58.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it made them melt,
because salt melts snow.

414
00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:00.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] What are we gonna do?

415
00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:02.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're not finished,

416
00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and now everyone's mittens
are covered with salt.

417
00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:08.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No problem. I always
carry extra mittens and snacks.

418
00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:11.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, and raisins
will not melt your sculpture.

419
00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:20.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, and they make
excellent eyes.

420
00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:22.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow! What a masterpiece!

421
00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:25.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs]
And it's only the beginning!

422
00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:26.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, everybody.

423
00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:30.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't want snow Rumy
to get lonely, do you?

424
00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:33.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great job, everybody!

425
00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs]
