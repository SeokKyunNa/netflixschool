Wow! You really flew that time.

108
00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:43.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It wasn't even close.

109
00:05:43.417 --> 00:05:46.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Guys, Bean jumped
over the Big Kahuna!

110
00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:49.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's really great, Bean.
Amazing!

111
00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:50.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

112
00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:53.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But now that I
look at the Big Kahuna,

113
00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:56.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it doesn't look so big anymore.

114
00:05:56.542 --> 00:06:00.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right. This morning,
it was almost to that tree.

115
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[gasps]
All the puddles are smaller.

116
00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:08.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait. First someone takes all
the water from my collection,

117
00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:10.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and now they steal
the Big Kahuna?

118
00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who would do that?

119
00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We don't know
what happened yet Rumy,

120
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and remember, there were
no fingerprints on the jars.

121
00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:19.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then where is the water going?

122
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And where does it end?

123
00:06:20.458 --> 00:06:22.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If someone is taking all
the water in Acorn Springs,

124
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that would be really bad,
especially if you're a fish.

125
00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:28.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Boots!
-Boots!

126
00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs]
He's okay.

127
00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:36.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And all his water
is right where it should be.

128
00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:38.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So let's follow the facts.

129
00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:41.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The water
in Boots's tank is fine.

130
00:06:41.292 --> 00:06:43.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the water in the puddles
is disappearing.

131
00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So how is the fish tank
different from the puddles?

132
00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:48.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The fish tank has a lid on it.

133
00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:52.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure, but Rumy's jars
all have lids, too.

134
00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:55.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They do, but Rumy
took off the lids so Millie

135
00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-could touch the water.
-Right.

136
00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:00.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But didn't Rumy say he
left the lid on one of his jars?

137
00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:03.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, the stinky one.

138
00:07:03.417 --> 00:07:07.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So one jar is still closed,
just like the fish tank.

139
00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:09.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we follow the facts,

140
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the stinky water
should still be there.

141
00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:13.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's find out.

142
00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:17.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all sighing]

143
00:07:19.403 --> 00:07:21.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you guys find
Rumy's water yet?

144
00:07:21.528 --> 00:07:24.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not yet. We're still
looking for more clues.

145
00:07:24.926 --> 00:07:28.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rumy, do you have the jar
of water from the hot springs?

146
00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:29.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

147
00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:31.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[water sloshes]
-Hey!

148
00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:33.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's still got water in it!

149
00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:37.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No one's stealing
the stinky water.

150
00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:41.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think there's another reason
this water's still here.

151
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rumy never
took the lid off this one.

152
00:07:43.792 --> 00:07:46.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only the water that's open
to the air is disappearing.

153
00:07:47.032 --> 00:07:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Like the puddles!
-That's right, Bean.

154
00:07:50.083 --> 00:07:52.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let's follow the facts.

155
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rumy took the lids off
his water collection last week,

156
00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:58.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and now all the water is gone.

157
00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:00.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the puddles
were there this morning,

158
00:08:00.542 --> 00:08:02.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but got smaller
by the afternoon.

159
00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:05.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As the day got warmer,
the puddles got smaller.

160
00:08:06.042 --> 00:08:09.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The water that's open to the air
is going somewhere...

161
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I think I know where.

162
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Where?
-Where?

163
00:08:14.315 --> 00:08:16.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can explain,
but I think it'll be easier

164
00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:21.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-from the top of that mountain.
-Then let's get climbing.

165
00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:27.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobody took your water, Rumy,
and nobody took our puddles.

166
00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:29.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at Acorn Springs.

167
00:08:29.664 --> 00:08:33.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can see the pond
and the spring and the ocean.

168
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But where's my water
and the water from the puddles?

169
00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:38.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's in the air around us.

170
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When the sun is out
and air is dry,

171
00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:43.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
drops of water
are pulled into the air.

172
00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:45.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's called evaporation.

173
00:08:45.208 --> 00:08:48.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So when I left the lids
off my jars,

174
00:08:48.542 --> 00:08:51.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the water floated away
a little at a time

175
00:08:51.708 --> 00:08:53.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
until it was all gone?

176
00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:55.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not gone.

177
00:08:55.125 --> 00:08:57.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When there's
enough water in the air,

178
00:08:57.292 --> 00:09:00.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it turns into clouds.
Clouds are full of water.

179
00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at that big one
coming our way.

180
00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:06.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Toby] That cloud holds the water
from your collection, Rumy.

181
00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:10.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yep, your water went up
into the air as evaporation,

182
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and now it's gonna
come back down as rain.

183
00:09:12.791 --> 00:09:13.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

184
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's
gonna start raining soon.

185
00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:19.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right.
We better go before we get wet.

186
00:09:19.765 --> 00:09:20.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Quick!
-Hurry!

187
00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:22.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's go!
-Come on!

188
00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:42.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The rain filled up my jars.
Look at them all.

189
00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:47.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[cheering]
-[laughs]

190
00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:50.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm so happy
all your water is back, Rumy.

191
00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:51.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me, too!

192
00:09:52.222 --> 00:09:54.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that water is
from every lake, ocean,

193
00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:56.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and river in the world.

194
00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:59.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your collection is even better
than it was before.

195
00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:02.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know! It's amazing!

196
00:10:02.324 --> 00:10:04.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you know what?

197
00:10:04.664 --> 00:10:08.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe our puddles
are back, too. Come on.

198
00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:11.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna jump the Big Kahuna
for real this time.

199
00:10:21.292 --> 00:10:23.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, Bean.
Show us how it's done.

200
00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can do it, Bean!

201
00:10:27.708 --> 00:10:29.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[gasps]
I can't watch.

202
00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:35.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hah!

203
00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:43.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did it!

204
00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:44.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[cheering]
-[laughs]

205
00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:46.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoo! Good job, Bean!

206
00:10:46.667 --> 00:10:48.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew you could do it.
[laughs]

207
00:10:49.042 --> 00:10:50.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-All right!
-Whoo! Yay!

208
00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:53.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everybody say, "Puddles"!

209
00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:54.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Puddles!
-Puddles!

210
00:10:58.708 --> 00:11:01.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So Rumy's water
didn't really disappear.

211
00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:03.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nope. No water does.
Just like our puddles,

212
00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rumy's water went into the air
