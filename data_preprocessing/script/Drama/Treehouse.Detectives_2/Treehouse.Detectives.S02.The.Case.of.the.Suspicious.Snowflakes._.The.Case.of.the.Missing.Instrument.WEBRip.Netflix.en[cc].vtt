00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that means we can't skate.

108
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if we can't skate,
it's not winter.

109
00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So if it's not winter,
I can do my Summer Spectacular.

110
00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I'm really confused.

111
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:32.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'm really hot in my scarf.

112
00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure you are,
because it's not cold,

113
00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:37.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is why the pond
is not frozen.

114
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're right, and that's a clue.

115
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It has to be cold
for the pond to freeze

116
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and for it to snow,
but it's warm,

117
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a warm, beautiful day

118
00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:50.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
full of singing birds
and colorful flowers.

119
00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:54.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we follow the facts,
it sure seems like summer,

120
00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so the snow is the one piece
that doesn't fit.

121
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But there it is, snow.

122
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps]

123
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jay, why don't you
do a snow show?

124
00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:08.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could call it
Jay's Snowy Spectacular.

125
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:11.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know. I really had a lot of fun
stuff planned for the summer show.

126
00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there's a whole lot
of fun winter stuff, too.

127
00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Snow is lots of fun.
There are snowmen.

128
00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And snow angels.

129
00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And snowballs.

130
00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can see it.
Jay's Snowy Spectacular,

131
00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I'll begin it
with a super snowflake spiral.

132
00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go!

133
00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yo!
-Come on!

134
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's time you and I
gave this snow a closer look.

135
00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:40.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sounds good to me. Come on.

136
00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow!

137
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at all this snow.

138
00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's enough here
for a million forts,

139
00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a zillion snowballs,
and a whole city of snowmen.

140
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'll create tricks
for every one of them.

141
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Watch. I'll begin
with the "Snowman Cancan."

142
00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's great, Jay.

143
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll build a snowman
you can dance with.

144
00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The best snowman ever.

145
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a snowman building expert.
You always start

146
00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
by making a great big ball
of snow for the body.

147
00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sounds good to me.

148
00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

149
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me help you.

150
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me, too.

151
00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just gather it up
with your hand,

152
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:32.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and roll the snow
into a ball like this.

153
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps]

154
00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:36.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, hold on.

155
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:38.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is going to work.

156
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[grunts]

157
00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groans]

158
00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

159
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It didn't work.

160
00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Bean groans]

161
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:50.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This snow doesn't make snowmen.
That's a clue.

162
00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't really do anything
that snow does.

163
00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not cold,

164
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and when I rub the snowflake,
it should melt.

165
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Toby]
And there's something in here,

166
00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a little brown spot.

167
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Snowflakes don't have
little brown spots.

168
00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think
these are snowflakes.

169
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How can it not be snow?

170
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's white and fluffy
and falling from the sky.

171
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Teri's right.
This snow isn't cold.

172
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's supposed
to fall from clouds, but look.

173
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's not a cloud in the sky.

174
00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right. This snow
is blowing in on the wind,

175
00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's all coming
from over there.

176
00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then that's the way we're going.
Come on, everybody!

177
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's snowing really hard!

178
00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should turn back!

179
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! Keep going!

180
00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you all yelling?

181
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

182
00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're supposed to yell
in snowstorms, aren't you?

183
00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think
this is a snowstorm.

184
00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jay]
Hey, it's summer!

185
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't believe it.

186
00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys made it summer again.

187
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All we did was follow the facts,
and they brought us here.

188
00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just as I suspected,

189
00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's not winter yet.

190
00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Each of these snowflakes

191
00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is carrying a seed
from these cottonwood trees.

192
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Remember those brown spots
Toby found?

193
00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those are the seeds.

194
00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what's all
the white stuff for?

195
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cottony bit
makes the seed float

196
00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so the wind can carry them
to new places

197
00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:40.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to make new cottonwood trees.

198
00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this isn't real snow.
It's summer snow.

199
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs]
Exactly.

200
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cottonwood trees
only do this in summer.

201
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which means I get to put on

202
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
my Summer Spectacular
show after all!

203
00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yippee!

204
00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prepare to be amazed.

205
00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Presenting
Jay's Summer Spectacular,

206
00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:07.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
starring Jay!

207
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[cheering]
-All right, Jay!

208
00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you. The first act
of my Summer Spectacular

209
00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is called "ode to the fluffy
cottonwood seeds of summer."

210
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

211
00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, Jay!

212
00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chirping]

213
00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say, "Snowflakes"!

214
00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Snowflakes!
