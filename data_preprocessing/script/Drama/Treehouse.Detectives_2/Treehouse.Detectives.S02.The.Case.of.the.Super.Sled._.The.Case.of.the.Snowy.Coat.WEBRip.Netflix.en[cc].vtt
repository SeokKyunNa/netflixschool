115
00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:16.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it's almost time
for the Downhill Dash,

116
00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:17.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I'd better get home.

117
00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Yes, I'm fine.

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

121
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think these runners
may be too thin.

00:06:38.818 --> 00:06:41.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

look the same as these.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:44.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the thin blades work well,

00:06:44.768 --> 00:06:46.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he doesn't even need a sled.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So let's use those same clues
to design Bean a Snow Rocket.

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:31.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yes, I am!

214
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Sorry. I was hiding.

215
00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're practicing for the big
hide-and-seek championship.

216
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, that's right.
I almost forgot.

217
00:12:08.964 --> 00:12:10.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs]
How could you forget?

218
00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We do it every year.

219
00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's so much fun!

220
00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:16.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now I just need to find Jay.

221
00:12:17.664 --> 00:12:19.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jay laughing]

222
00:12:20.314 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do clouds usually have feet?

223
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gotcha! It's me!

224
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pretty good, right?

225
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] I'll say!

226
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're really good at this.

227
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had to up my game to try to
beat Erwin the Ermine this year.

228
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, I don't know.

229
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erwin's the best
hide-and-seeker around.

230
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's won the championship
every fall!

231
00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] He's amazing,

232
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with his lustrous, brown fur

233
00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that just blends in
with everything.

234
00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look. You can barely see him.

235
00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, he is good.

236
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lots of things in Acorn Springs
are brown like Erwin,

237
00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:58.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so he can hide anywhere.

238
00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:01.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs]
I can't wait 'til he gets here!

239
00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:04.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, guys!

240
00:13:05.975 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, E-Erwin? Is that you?

241
00:13:10.025 --> 00:13:12.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course.
Who else would it be?

242
00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't wait to play
hide-and-seek with you all.

243
00:13:15.605 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Check out some of my new moves
for this year. I call this...

244
00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"blend into the bark."

245
00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:27.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And don't forget this one...

246
00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"rocking the rock."

247
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When it comes to hiding,
I'm down with anything brown.

248
00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:39.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs] Erwin,
I don't know how to say this.

249
00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, you know
your fur is white, right?

250
00:13:43.466 --> 00:13:45.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess it's been getting
a little lighter,

251
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but not so much you'd notice.

252
00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:52.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs] Actually, we do
kinda notice just a little.

253
00:13:53.691 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, a lot.

254
00:13:55.472 --> 00:13:56.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually you're so white,

255
00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you don't blend in
with anything.

256
00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Except a mountain
of marshmallows. Ooh!

257
00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:03.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'd be great at hiding in a
mountain of marshmallows.

258
00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or a pile of powdered sugar!

259
00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or really awesome
pretend clouds!

260
00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait. Uh, I don't blend in
with anything?

261
00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What happened?
Why did my fur turn white?

262
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know,
but I know who can find out.

263
00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Toby and Teri. Come on.

264
00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never seen
anything like it.

265
00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:30.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys just gotta help Erwin.

266
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's the hide-and-seek champion.
He's gotta play!

267
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know
if I can play like this.

268
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:40.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What am I gonna do?
I can't blend into anything.

269
00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:43.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll figure this out.
I promise.

270
00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sounds like we've got a case.

271
00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:46.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will you excuse us?

272
00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now that Erwin's fur is white,

275
00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he doesn't blend in

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:03.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which means he can't play in the
hide-and-seek championship this year.

277
00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

your fur is white.

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're green
in the spring and summer,

321
00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they turn red and yellow
every fall

322
00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
right before
they fall off the trees.

323
00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fall came. Leaves change,
falling off tree. Got it!

324
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see what else has changed.

325
00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:28.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let's try one more time.

326
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ready, set, scrunch!

327
00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The trick to good scrunching
is to tuck everything in.

328
00:17:40.381 --> 00:17:42.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got it! How's this?

329
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can see your head.

330
00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And your butt. Move your feet!

331
00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:56.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoops!

332
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoa! Ohh! Aah!

333
00:18:00.364 --> 00:18:03.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you okay?
That looks splooshy.

334
00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm fine.
I just fell in the mud.

335
00:18:06.364 --> 00:18:08.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, if Erwin
was covered with mud,

336
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he'd be all brown again.

337
00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if I was brown,
I could play hide-and-seek.

338
00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:17.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erwin! [gasps]
We gotta cover you with mud!

339
00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:18.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should roll in it.

340
00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah!

341
00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:33.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rocco!

342
00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, guys. Check it out!

343
00:18:39.505 --> 00:18:43.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm working on my Furry Pika
Split Jump with a spin.

344
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, that was impressive.

345
00:18:53.424 --> 00:18:55.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks. It's my signature move.

346
00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:59.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey! The pond is frozen.

347
00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:00.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It happened last night.

348
00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yesterday this was all water,
and now ice.

349
00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys on a case?

350
00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. We were looking around

351
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to see what's changed
in Acorn Springs.

352
00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think a frozen pond is
exactly what we're looking for.

353
00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? Then I guess I helped.

354
00:19:16.541 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definitely.
A lot of things have changed.

355
00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:21.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the leaves
have fallen off the trees,

356
00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the pond is frozen.

357
00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know what else is changing?

358
00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The seasons! It's winter now.

359
00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

360
00:19:30.116 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That Rocco is <i>really </i>graceful?

361
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You read my mind.

362
00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs]
You are graceful, Rocco,

363
00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but we're talking
about Erwin the Ermine.

364
00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We think we know
why he turned white.

365
00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We gotta go.
Great skating, Rocco.

366
00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:44.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And thanks for the help.

367
00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anytime! See ya!

368
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at me! I'm brown again.

369
00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're good as new.

370
00:19:57.321 --> 00:20:00.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Guys! We've got some good news.

371
00:20:01.025 --> 00:20:03.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So do we. Look at Erwin.
We made him brown again.

372
00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:05.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just in time for our
hide-and-seek championship.

373
00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:07.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that mud?

374
00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:10.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Now I can hide anywhere.

375
00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:14.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Check out the old exact same
color as the ground maneuver!

376
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] Amazing, right?

377
00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:17.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

378
00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:21.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in a sort of
I-can-see-you way.

379
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:25.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I'm brown again.

380
00:20:25.705 --> 00:20:27.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now the mud's coming off.

381
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:30.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not gonna be able to play
in the championship after all.

382
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:33.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's okay.
You're supposed to be white,

383
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:36.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just like everything
in Acorn Springs.

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:40.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:42.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the color of snow.
