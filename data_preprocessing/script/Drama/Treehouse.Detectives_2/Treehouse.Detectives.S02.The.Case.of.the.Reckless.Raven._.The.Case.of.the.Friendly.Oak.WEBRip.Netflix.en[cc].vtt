00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I drew up diagrams

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:35.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is so clever,

143
00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
why'd he leave footprints

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to follow them.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

play tricks on Fergus?

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but when he swings on this one,

161
00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he's gonna end up

174
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Poe's the one who's been
pulling pranks, Fergus.

175
00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
