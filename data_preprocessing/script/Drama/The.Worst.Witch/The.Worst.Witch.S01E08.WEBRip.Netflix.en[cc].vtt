Never put a cat in a cauldron.

Never remove any part

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Precisely.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now.

[Ethel] She begged me to help her.

Ethel, the last time you attempted
to help Mildred,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we had a most dreadful kerfuffle
and two very confused cats.

111
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Let's not forget Mildred's catalog

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Miss Cackle] Indeed.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The two of you seem to be stuck
in something of a vicious circle.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's time you put a stop to it.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're to keep away from each other

Go back to your lessons,

decide upon the best course of action.

Could I please make a suggestion,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-That we let off your sister lightly?
-No, not at all.

121
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She's getting far too big
for her broomstick.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And the other first-years
aren't far behind.

A touch of friendly competition never
hurt anyone, you know that, Esmeralda.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm not sure this could be described
as friendly.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I had an idea
of how to make things better.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's a little drastic, though.

[Miss Hardbroom]
Remember, if you cannot control yourself,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you cannot control magic.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And if you cannot control magic...

131
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
magic will control you.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Still, you shouldn't be in trouble
for something that Ethel did.

137
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I wonder what the punishment's
going to be.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No need to panic, girls,
they're quite harmless.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
More like a secret society,

Why are the school records
kept in a dungeon?

Technically, it was only a dungeon
for a century or two.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's storage now...

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
unless you rub Miss Hardbroom up
the wrong way.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's a bit small.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There are no small filing cabinets,
my dear, only small witches. [laughs]

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
All Hubbles, present and past,
schools and academies, first to last.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So if I was from a witching family,
we would have found them.

Why don't we get you back upstairs,
start sniffing out this coven?

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

It doesn't matter how many stuffy
old witches you've got in your family.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
A coven is about coming together

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and doing incredible things with others
that would be impossible on your own.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Exactly. Although putting
the two together isn't advisable.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
One great leap for man,

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:13.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, a smidge of rocket fuel

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Think about what you feel.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

It's not too late, is it?

It must have been too strong.

added something to send it out of control.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
