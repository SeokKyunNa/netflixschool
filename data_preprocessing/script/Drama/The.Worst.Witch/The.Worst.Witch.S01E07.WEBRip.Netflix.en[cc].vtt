00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
not only as your daughter's

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but as deputy head.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is because...

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She really is an exemplary sports witch.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But right now, I can't recall.

156
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Not one occasion did I have
to correct her chanting

157
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
or remark on her tempo.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She has been note-perfect all term.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I only wish the other girls

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So... Maud must be doing very well.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So if we survive HB,
we have spell science next...

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
then flying, then advanced chanting.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I thought advanced chanting was Year Two.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The teachers didn't even mention
the flying test, the frog...

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
not even the explosion.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I got hold of some forgetting powder

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Please don't get mad. It worked.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It really, really worked.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

She's forgotten me.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Of course she has.

my biggest mistake at Cackle's is?

This is all very well,
but I don't really see that it's relevant.

Miss Hubble, as an... ordinary person,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I realize you are not acquainted
with the Witches' Code.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-However--

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It doesn't sound as though
that's what's happened here.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We are talking about
a complete lack of magical control.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You see, the way I read it,
the code is mainly about

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
not deliberately harming others,
using magic for personal gain

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
or publicly exposing other witches.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So which rule has Mildred actually broken?

199
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Right, well, if there's nothing else,

200
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think we have other appointments
to get to.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

about the Witches' Code?

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sorry. I like to be invisible
on parents' evening...

203
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
keep a discreet eye on things, you know.

204
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll take it from here.

205
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I realize Miss Hardbroom
can be a little brusque.

206
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You could say that.

207
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
However, I'm forced to admit
that she may have a point.

208
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sorry?

209
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I have been in two minds about this,

210
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:48.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but blowing up the potion lab today
was the final straw.

211
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I also feel that Mildred Hubble
has not really found her feet.

212
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Perhaps, if she had a friend
to guide her...

213
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Julie] Well, she's got Enid.

214
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...the right kind of friend,
a steadying influence,

215
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
things might be different, but she hasn't
connected with anyone like that.

216
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm afraid everything she's touched
has turned to disaster.

217
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Now, I've been through this once.
-No, Mum.

218
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She's right.

219
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't belong here.

220
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sorry, Dad.

221
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Second-worst witch.
Wait till I tell your mother.

222
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Enid! It's terrible!
Mildred's forgotten that we're friends.

223
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're telling me this why?

224
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Don't say you've forgotten, too.

225
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is a little bit weird, so...

226
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You gave me
some pirated forgetting powder

227
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so that I'd have
a perfect parents' evening.

228
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sounds like something I'd do.

229
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Look.

230
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
[Enid] My handwriting.

231
00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How do I reverse the magic?

232
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't know.

233
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm not losing my best friend.
You're going to help.

234
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll get you a magic tutor.
We'll apply to a different academy.

235
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Why didn't you tell me you were a witch?
-What makes you think I'm a witch?

236
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I heard you with the other parents,
and only witches know the Witches' Code.

237
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
All this time, you've been hiding it
from me. Why?

238
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mildred.

239
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If I'd had the same start in life
as the rest of the girls,

240
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
maybe I wouldn't be leaving.

241
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[door opens]

242
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs]

243
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Maud and Enid] Millie!

244
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't have time
for this nonsense right now.

245
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I need to have one last look around
before I go forever.

246
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[Maud] What?
-[Enid] Forever?

247
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Miss Cackle said it herself,
I don't fit in,

248
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I don't have a role model,
and she's right.

249
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What does she mean? You have me.

250
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
A positive role model, Enid. [sniffles]

251
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Maud] Oh. Oh, no, this is all my fault!

252
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How can it be? I hardly know you.

253
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But you do. We're best friends.

254
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[chuckles]
The girl who's never made a mistake,

255
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
best friends with the worst witch?

256
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Tell her.

257
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I may have given her a forgetting powder.

258
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The explosion at lunchtime,
we were all there.

259
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, that was just me and Enid. [sniffles]

260
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
OK. How did you get to Cackle's
in the first place?

261
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I...

262
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs] I'm blanking on it at the moment.

263
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I crash-landed onto your balcony.
How can you not even remember that?

264
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What does it matter how I arrived anyway?
I'm not a pupil here anymore.

265
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There's only one thing for it.

266
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I've got to tell the truth.
-That'll get you thrown out.

267
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't care what happens to me
if it saves Mildred.

268
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It will also get me thrown out.

269
00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'd be banned from
every witching academy in the land.

270
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Every witching academy?

271
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You didn't tell me it was that big
of an offense.

272
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.079  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There's got to be some other way.

273
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.319  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes, Ethel continues to perform
impressively in every subject.

274
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What about extracurricular activities,
Miss Cackle?

275
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You must tell Mother about those.

276
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Miss Cackle] Oh, yes.

277
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Ethel takes part
in many out-of-hours activities:

278
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
invisible netball,
instrument-less orchestra,

279
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
hat-making club.

280
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In fact,
she's the only member of that one.

281
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Get back to your room, Sybil.

282
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That...

283
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That is wonderful news.

284
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mother, why are you talking
to my little sister,

285
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
my little sister who's at home?

286
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Don't fret about it, darling.

287
00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now, who are we seeing next?
Miss Bat, is it?

288
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're not here, are you, Mother?

289
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Of course I'm here.
We're looking at each other, aren't we?

290
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
OK, no, I'm not here.

291
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
A projection spell, Mother!
How could you?

292
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You couldn't even be bothered
making the trip.

293
00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, come now, darling.
I will be here next month.

294
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
For Esmeralda's prize-giving,
we know that.

295
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You wouldn't miss Esmeralda's night
for the world.

296
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Maud Spellbody, do you mind?
-What do you want, Miss Perfect?

297
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I suppose your mother's
super proud of you.

298
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you, Miss Cackle.

299
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What is the meaning of bursting in?

300
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Miss Cackle, I heard
that Mildred Hubble's leaving.

301
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sadly, she has chosen that path.

302
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

My daughter is the second-worst witch

Mistakes are how you learn.
Mistakes are a sign that you tried.
