Very well.

One and all will be agog,

Mildred Hubble is quite the magician.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I haven't seen a multi-transformation like
that in some time, have you, Miss Cackle?

[Miss Cackle] Quite right, Miss Bat.

What will happen to Ethel and her nose?

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll work out how to fix her nose,
but the punishment will fit the crime.

[Miss Cackle] Tell the girls they won't
see Ethel Hallow for a day or two.

If you hadn't recognized that song,
I dread to think what would have happened.

Now be honest, did you really
take Drusilla one mile straight up?

It's only what you would have done.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Although, you'd have made
a bigger mess of it.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

In other words,
we make a pretty crafty team, right?
